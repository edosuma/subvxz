Hey, Rowdy.

01:53.579 --> 01:55.078
Yeah, Cletus?

01:55.080 --> 01:57.080
How much you think we're gonna
get for killin' this thing?

01:57.082 --> 01:59.417
About a million dollars.

02:00.686 --> 02:02.986
And we're gonna split
that like 50/50, right?

02:02.988 --> 02:04.488
Like?

02:04.490 --> 02:06.056
400 thousand each?

02:06.058 --> 02:07.824
You lost your goddamn mind?

02:07.826 --> 02:09.893
We not splittin' it 50/50.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.762
Hell, I got the
weapons, the traps,

02:11.764 --> 02:13.897
even brought the goddamn beer.

02:13.899 --> 02:15.866
Only thing I brought
your ass along for

02:15.868 --> 02:17.100
is so you could help
me drag the body

02:17.102 --> 02:19.870
out of the goddamn woods.

02:19.872 --> 02:21.104
Alright.

02:21.106 --> 02:22.105
I was just hoping to
get enough, you know,

02:22.107 --> 02:25.108
to help me get a
new double wide.

02:25.110 --> 02:25.942
Gonna need a huntin' dog.

02:25.944 --> 02:27.412
Maybe get a bass boat.

02:28.847 --> 02:31.114
Yeah, that oughta be
enough for all that.

02:31.116 --> 02:33.485
You don't think real
big do you, Cletus?

02:36.855 --> 02:39.489
I figure about 20 percent.

02:39.491 --> 02:41.058
Like a hundred Benjamins?

02:41.060 --> 02:41.892
Aw, man, that'd be awesome!

02:41.894 --> 02:43.495
That works for me!

02:44.730 --> 02:46.396
Sure, Cletus,
whatever you say.

02:46.398 --> 02:47.864
Let's just

02:47.866 --> 02:48.867
be quiet so's we can

02:50.702 --> 02:51.802
sneak up on this thing.

02:58.544 --> 03:00.577
I'm ready to get out
of this damn canoe.

03:00.579 --> 03:01.413
Come on.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.781
Here, take this damn paddle
and stick in the boat for me.

03:04.783 --> 03:05.617
God, damn.

03:07.452 --> 03:08.687
I'll get you a gun.

03:10.689 --> 03:11.621
Thanks, Rowdy.

03:11.623 --> 03:13.557
I shoulda brought my sister.

03:13.559 --> 03:14.260
Why, is she hot?

03:15.728 --> 03:20.733
Rowdy, dude, Rowdy.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.502
Look, restricted
area, do not enter.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.773
Well, hell yeah it's
a restricted area.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.472
You think they just
gonna invite people

03:29.474 --> 03:31.175
up here to kill things?

03:31.177 --> 03:33.044
Come on, damn it,
get in front of me.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.979
But that movie with the
kids and the witch thing,

03:34.981 --> 03:36.080
- they all died!
- I wanna see you

03:36.082 --> 03:37.650
at all times, march.

03:38.585 --> 03:39.917
And be quiet, damn it.

03:39.919 --> 03:41.686
You did take a look at
all that information

03:41.688 --> 03:44.856
I sent you and study all
those pictures, right?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.791
Well, of course, I did.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.593
Good, cause there was
a shit ton of important

03:48.595 --> 03:50.061
information in there and
if you don't know it,

03:50.063 --> 03:51.865
you're gonna get us both killed.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.533
Maybe we should review
it just to make sure

03:55.535 --> 03:56.934
- I didn't forget anything.
- God damn it, Cletus.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.736
You didn't look at one
damn thing, did you?

03:58.738 --> 03:59.904
Alright, fine, you caught me.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.672
But, come on, what's the
worst thing that could happen?

04:01.674 --> 04:02.807
What's the worst
thing that could happen?

04:02.809 --> 04:03.977
Are you kidding me?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.511
Let's take a second here to
review the rules, alright?

04:07.513 --> 04:09.847
Rule one: absolutely
no pissin' or shittin'

04:09.849 --> 04:10.948
of any kind out
here in the woods.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.450
If you're gonna do
it, you gotta do it

04:12.452 --> 04:14.219
in a bag or in a bottle
cause if this thing

04:14.221 --> 04:16.019
gets one scent of
you, he'll be down

04:16.022 --> 04:18.789
on top of us in a few seconds
and he'll kill us both.

04:18.791 --> 04:23.628
Number two: no loud noises,
keep your voice down.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.829
I been telling you that.

04:24.831 --> 04:28.401
And number three: absolutely
no fornification of any kind.

04:29.502 --> 04:30.235
Fornification?

04:30.237 --> 04:31.871
You mean, like, getting it on?

04:32.872 --> 04:34.106
Man, I don't know what you got

04:34.108 --> 04:35.606
planned for out here
but I'm not like that.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.209
It's okay if you are.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.911
Cletus, I ain't gay

04:38.913 --> 04:41.880
and I sure as hell wouldn't
be gay with you if I was.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.682
I'm just trying to tell you
this thing is territorial

04:44.684 --> 04:48.086
and it's very important
that you follow the rules.

04:48.088 --> 04:52.523
The thing it hates most in
the world is male ejaculate.

04:52.525 --> 04:53.759
So you just keep it zipped up.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.127
Keep your tally
whacker in your pants

04:55.129 --> 04:56.562
and we'll be just fine.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.931
Now come on.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.232
I actually got
buttons not a zipper.

05:08.943 --> 05:09.942
Well, really, Rowdy.

05:09.944 --> 05:13.147
- Why wouldn't you like me...
- Watch the tree.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.020
It's slippery down here.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.857
Wait.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.059
Wait.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.202
Looks like a football.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.672
It's got the toes.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.940
And a heel!

05:41.942 --> 05:43.175
Shh.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.778
Could we set the trap now?

05:46.981 --> 05:48.015
Wait.

05:49.984 --> 05:50.818
Not yet.

05:53.254 --> 05:54.155
He's out there.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.490
Let's go.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.928
I'll spread around
here, help me out.

06:02.930 --> 06:03.929
You and I are gonna split up.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.264
I'm gonna take a spot up
over there in the woods,

06:05.266 --> 06:06.732
you're gonna take
a spot over here.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.601
If you need
anything, don't yell.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.938
Alright, you just make a whistle
sound like a little bird.

06:11.940 --> 06:12.904
- Alright?
- Okay, okay.

06:12.906 --> 06:13.605
- Got it?
- Okay.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.242
Let's go.

06:17.178 --> 06:18.577
- Hey, Rowdy?
- Yeah?

06:18.579 --> 06:19.979
You know, ever since
you brought it up,

06:19.981 --> 06:21.948
I kinda gotta pee.

06:21.950 --> 06:22.882
Okay, take this jug with you

06:22.884 --> 06:23.950
and you piss in that.

06:23.952 --> 06:25.650
If you fill it up, you drink it.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.786
Of course I ain't doing that.

06:26.788 --> 06:27.954
Yeah, they do it on the
survival shows all the time.

06:27.956 --> 06:29.989
This ain't no survival show!

06:29.991 --> 06:31.891
If you pour that
out on the ground,

06:31.893 --> 06:34.060
then this thing's
gonna smell that.

06:34.062 --> 06:36.095
It's gonna be on top
of us in no time.

06:36.965 --> 06:38.331
Now, look, they say
it's good for you.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.365
They even cook with
it, now come on.

06:39.367 --> 06:40.599
Let's get this son of a bitch.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.135
Go take your spot.

06:42.137 --> 06:43.638
Fucking kidding.

06:53.982 --> 06:55.016
Oh, gross, man!

06:56.684 --> 06:58.186
I ain't drinkin'
that shit anyhow.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.727
Oh, gross.

07:07.729 --> 07:09.028
Hey, Rowdy, I think I hear it!

07:09.030 --> 07:10.129
- I think I hear him!
- Cletus!

07:10.131 --> 07:10.830
I told you to whistle!

07:10.832 --> 07:12.198
Well, I got pee on my hands.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.833
I ain't got no hand sanitizer.

07:13.835 --> 07:15.402
Cletus, you're
gonna get us killed!

07:15.404 --> 07:16.235
I think he's coming!

07:16.237 --> 07:17.070
Stay away!

07:17.072 --> 07:18.272
Stay away!

07:18.274 --> 07:19.373
Pull it together, pull
it together, Cletus.

07:19.375 --> 07:20.640
He's coming, Rowdy!

07:20.642 --> 07:21.375
Shh!

07:21.377 --> 07:22.309
Hey, you're gonna get us killed!

07:22.311 --> 07:23.109
I don't know where to go!

07:23.111 --> 07:24.043
I don't know what to do!

07:24.045 --> 07:25.180
I don't know where he's at!

07:26.081 --> 07:27.113
Oh shit.

07:29.151 --> 07:30.150
Hey, hey!

07:30.152 --> 07:30.983
He's behind you!

07:30.985 --> 07:31.818
He's behind you!

07:31.820 --> 07:32.919
Oh, shit!

07:32.921 --> 07:34.087
- I stepped in the pee again!
- Turn around, shoot it!

07:34.089 --> 07:34.921
Shoot it!

07:34.923 --> 07:36.323
Come over here
or I'll come there!

08:02.051 --> 08:03.383
No, no, no!

08:03.385 --> 08:05.152
No, no, no, no, no, no!

08:16.298 --> 08:17.231
No!

08:17.233 --> 08:18.067
No!

08:43.993 --> 08:46.026
The fuck are you
watching up there, man?

08:46.028 --> 08:47.161
Stay focused.

08:47.163 --> 08:47.997
Shit.

08:53.936 --> 08:55.271
- Fuckin' kid.
- Oh, shit.

08:58.073 --> 08:58.908
Hey, man.

08:59.975 --> 09:02.910
What's the craziest thing
you done with a chick?

09:02.912 --> 09:04.845
There's this
one chick at work,

09:04.847 --> 09:07.215
she used to love to come
down and suck my dick.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.082
Every morning before
anybody else got to work.

09:09.084 --> 09:10.285
Nice.

09:10.287 --> 09:11.252
But I tried to fuck
her this one time

09:11.254 --> 09:13.221
in this bathroom that
was under construction,

09:13.223 --> 09:15.123
she fucking totally
freaked out on me.

09:15.125 --> 09:16.224
It's like she'd
rather get caught

09:16.226 --> 09:17.458
with my dick in her mouth.

09:19.095 --> 09:20.027
Made no sense.

09:20.029 --> 09:21.062
That's pretty hot, though.

09:21.064 --> 09:22.896
- It was pretty hot.
- Ah, but I got something

09:22.898 --> 09:24.199
that'll blow your minds.

09:24.201 --> 09:25.533
Happened to me last night.

09:25.535 --> 09:26.900
Wait a second,
you're telling me

09:26.902 --> 09:28.269
you got your dick
sucked every single day

09:28.271 --> 09:29.470
at work and you
never got caught?

09:29.472 --> 09:31.139
Not every day, but

09:31.141 --> 09:33.374
I got it sucked several
times a week, yeah.

09:33.376 --> 09:36.244
You weren't afraid
of getting fired?

09:36.246 --> 09:37.278
Not really, I
mean, shit we were

09:37.280 --> 09:39.214
going through layoffs anyway.

09:39.216 --> 09:41.216
But the chick did tell the boss.

09:41.218 --> 09:42.150
- I didn't give a fuck.
- Wait, wait, wait.

09:42.152 --> 09:43.952
So he wasn't pissed about it?

09:43.954 --> 09:45.220
Not really.

09:45.222 --> 09:46.354
He just called me to
his office and said,

09:46.356 --> 09:47.922
if you get caught getting
your dick sucked at work,

09:47.924 --> 09:50.191
I'ma have to fire your ass

09:50.193 --> 09:52.128
but until then, have fun.

09:53.263 --> 09:54.262
Alright, alright,
enough already.

09:54.264 --> 09:55.899
Can I tell you my story?

09:57.067 --> 09:58.233
Yeah, tell your
fuckin' story, man.

09:58.235 --> 10:00.268
It's a good story!

10:00.270 --> 10:02.839
So last night I'm fuckin'
this super hot chick.

10:03.974 --> 10:05.408
- Wow.
- And she was a squirter.

10:11.481 --> 10:12.315
Wow!

10:14.251 --> 10:16.050
It's not a myth!

10:16.987 --> 10:18.886
She shat out diarrhea on you?

10:18.888 --> 10:21.189
Her pussy shot out
shit on him, man.

10:21.191 --> 10:22.123
Yeah, that's what I said.

10:22.125 --> 10:24.259
What he meant was,
she shot pussy juice

10:24.261 --> 10:25.762
out of her vag, dude.

10:26.597 --> 10:28.231
So you're serious, man?

10:29.299 --> 10:31.065
You actually fucked a squirter?

10:31.067 --> 10:32.000
The myth?

10:32.002 --> 10:33.968
I assure you, it was real.

10:33.970 --> 10:36.271
Freaked me the fuck
out, but it was so hot.

10:36.273 --> 10:38.239
Oh shit, she just left.

10:38.241 --> 10:39.242
Get ready, guys.

10:40.210 --> 10:41.510
Fuck, man!

10:41.512 --> 10:42.478
I told you to keep
an eye out, man.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.382
What the fuck were you doin'?

10:45.616 --> 10:47.784
Only got a few seconds
to make this shit happen.

10:52.088 --> 10:53.355
How am I lookin', we good?

10:53.357 --> 10:55.190
Yeah, got it

10:55.192 --> 10:56.425
Fuck it.

10:56.427 --> 10:58.993
Alright, brother, this
is what we planned.

10:58.995 --> 10:59.961
Alright, ready.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.029
Let's do this, man.

11:01.031 --> 11:01.929
Let's fucking do it.

11:01.931 --> 11:03.198
- Here.
- One, two.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.133
Hey, man, don't
leave me hanging.

11:04.135 --> 11:04.932
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:04.934 --> 11:05.634
Fuckin' A, man.

11:05.636 --> 11:08.103
- Ready?
- One, two.

11:10.441 --> 11:11.275
Oh my God.

11:15.980 --> 11:17.946
This is crazy, this is
crazy, this is crazy.

11:17.948 --> 11:18.580
It's crazy!

11:24.488 --> 11:26.188
It's unlocked, let's go.

11:26.190 --> 11:27.389
Go, go, go, go!

11:27.391 --> 11:29.358
Okay, whoo.

11:42.406 --> 11:45.341
Freeze, motherfucker!

11:45.343 --> 11:46.542
What the fuck?

11:46.544 --> 11:47.345
What the?

11:49.914 --> 11:51.548
He fucking fainted.

11:51.550 --> 11:53.315
Well, that wasn't
supposed to happen.

11:53.317 --> 11:54.185
Oh, shit.

11:55.587 --> 11:57.152
What the?

11:57.154 --> 11:57.986
Oh, shit.

11:57.988 --> 11:58.590
What the fuck?

11:59.491 --> 12:01.423
Ah, fuck, it didn't flush.

12:01.425 --> 12:04.326
Oh, disgusting.

12:04.328 --> 12:05.528
I gotta get something
for his head.

12:05.530 --> 12:07.499
We can't carry
him out like that.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.232
I can see his ball sac, man.

12:10.234 --> 12:12.502
Are we gonna wipe his ass?

12:12.504 --> 12:13.436
You shitting me?

12:13.438 --> 12:14.404
Do we need to wipe his ass?

12:14.406 --> 12:15.239
I don't know.

12:16.173 --> 12:17.407
Let's just hope
it was a clean shit.

12:17.409 --> 12:19.609
Am I gonna pull up his pants?

12:19.611 --> 12:22.111
I'll do it if you
do the head, man.

12:22.113 --> 12:23.147
Jesus Christ.

12:26.318 --> 12:27.617
It's your
idea, so fuck it.

12:27.619 --> 12:28.453
Oh, God.

12:34.024 --> 12:34.959
Oh, shit.

12:36.128 --> 12:37.394
I think that's gonna
have to work, man.

12:37.396 --> 12:39.195
I can't really touch
all this, you know?

12:39.197 --> 12:40.397
I touched enough for me.

12:40.399 --> 12:42.732
We'll fix him when
he gets in the van.

12:47.406 --> 12:48.373
Oh, fuck, he's heavy.

12:50.409 --> 12:52.308
Oh, dude, farting!

12:52.310 --> 12:53.610
Fuck.

12:57.115 --> 12:59.084
- What the?
- Watch where you're going.

13:00.318 --> 13:01.384
Kiss my ass, lady.

13:01.386 --> 13:03.386
Kissin' ass is out of style.

13:03.388 --> 13:05.257
Lay down and I'll
shit in your mouth.

13:06.591 --> 13:08.191
What?

13:08.193 --> 13:09.426
You better be nice, lady,

13:09.428 --> 13:10.226
or I'll come back and
steal your scooter.

13:10.228 --> 13:12.195
You're not
stealin' my scooter,

13:12.197 --> 13:14.966
you motherfuckin'
son of a bitch.

13:16.001 --> 13:17.233
What the fuck?

13:17.235 --> 13:18.501
Ah, fuck it, dude,
come on, let's go.

13:18.503 --> 13:19.436
Let's get outta here.

13:19.438 --> 13:21.104
Hey, assholes, where
are you taking him?

13:21.106 --> 13:22.505
I'm calling the cops.

13:24.610 --> 13:26.411
- What the hell, man?
- Unlock!

13:27.647 --> 13:30.648
- You're supposed to help us.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!

13:30.650 --> 13:32.048
Don't you know how
to fuckin' knock?

13:32.050 --> 13:33.483
What the fuck
were you doing, man?

13:35.353 --> 13:36.554
Oh, fuck!

13:36.556 --> 13:38.254
Jesus Christ,
okay, okay, alright.

13:38.256 --> 13:40.458
- I told you to stay focused.
- Go, go!

13:40.460 --> 13:43.059
How do I fuckin' turn
the emergency brake off?

13:43.061 --> 13:44.260
Fuck, how do I?

13:44.262 --> 13:45.629
Why'd you set the
emergency brake?

13:45.631 --> 13:47.565
It's for fucking safety!

13:47.567 --> 13:49.032
- Jesus Christ!
- Man, go!

13:49.034 --> 13:51.335
The old lady is gonna
get our license plate!

13:51.337 --> 13:52.168
Oh, God.

13:52.170 --> 13:53.437
Oh, fuck, rag okay.

13:53.439 --> 13:55.271
Cum everywhere, fuck!

13:55.273 --> 13:56.576
Okay, oh, shit.

13:58.578 --> 13:59.810
Alright, we're set!

13:59.812 --> 14:02.047
He's okay, that
was fucking fast.

14:05.284 --> 14:06.452
Okay, tape his hands.

14:09.622 --> 14:12.223
- Alright, alright.
- I think that's good enough.

14:12.225 --> 14:13.591
That works.

14:13.593 --> 14:14.460
What a rush, huh?

14:16.662 --> 14:18.029
I did not expect that.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.135
I'm gonna lay down.

14:26.439 --> 14:28.839
Whoo!

14:28.841 --> 14:30.009
Oh, man.

14:31.344 --> 14:33.110
The fuck you doing, man?

14:33.112 --> 14:34.514
Fuckin' hornball.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.581
Hey, what are you listening to?

14:37.583 --> 14:39.149
It's my song.

14:39.151 --> 14:40.184
That's your song?

14:40.186 --> 14:41.552
It's my jam.

14:41.554 --> 14:43.022
It fucking sucks.

14:48.829 --> 14:51.428
That's rock n' roll, man!

14:51.430 --> 14:52.429
Yeah!

15:38.210 --> 15:39.544
Jarrett.

15:39.546 --> 15:41.548
You are following the
directions, right?

15:42.416 --> 15:43.615
Yeah, I'm followin' the GPS.

15:43.617 --> 15:45.383
Not the
GPS, the directions

15:45.385 --> 15:46.718
that I gave you to follow!

15:46.720 --> 15:48.219
The GPS is gonna get us lost!

15:48.221 --> 15:50.622
Let me out or I'll
pop you full of lead!

15:50.624 --> 15:51.856
What the fuck?

15:51.858 --> 15:53.425
Get him, get the gun!

15:56.263 --> 15:57.562
My fucking ear, man.

15:57.564 --> 15:58.730
What the fuck?

15:58.732 --> 15:59.898
What the, what the fuck?

15:59.900 --> 16:01.399
Oh my God.

16:01.401 --> 16:02.500
Can I get the shit?

16:02.502 --> 16:03.702
- Get that shit?
- Just stop pulling it,

16:03.704 --> 16:04.769
put him out!

16:04.771 --> 16:06.304
Get the cum rag!

16:06.306 --> 16:07.472
Jarrett, the cum rag!

16:07.474 --> 16:08.540
Fuck, fuck!

16:08.542 --> 16:09.641
Just fucking pour it on there.

16:09.643 --> 16:10.809
Pour it on the cum rag.

16:11.712 --> 16:12.579
Holy shit.

16:14.648 --> 16:15.580
Put it on his fucking face.

16:15.582 --> 16:16.348
Where is it, right there?

16:16.350 --> 16:17.684
Oh, oh my God.

16:18.752 --> 16:20.953
Is it working?

16:20.955 --> 16:22.520
I think it worked.

16:22.522 --> 16:23.355
I think it worked.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.589
Oh, God.

16:25.525 --> 16:28.259
Who the fuck
carries an ankle gun?

16:28.261 --> 16:30.462
Well, this dude does.

16:30.464 --> 16:31.897
Well, next time
we'll check but.

16:31.899 --> 16:34.699
That was so
fucking close, huh?

16:34.701 --> 16:35.770
Shot up on the fuckin', huh.

16:37.504 --> 16:38.671
Oh, that was close, oh my god.

16:38.673 --> 16:41.206
Whoo.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.440
Get some more tape.

16:42.442 --> 16:44.309
We need more tape
for this fucker.

16:44.311 --> 16:45.613
I'll tape him this time, shit.

16:58.860 --> 17:00.726
Hey, uncle, we're here.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.627
What?

17:01.629 --> 17:04.664
- We're here, we made it.
- It's dark.

17:04.665 --> 17:05.531
Yeah, it's 8:50.

17:05.532 --> 17:08.299
We lost a few hours,
but we got here!

17:08.300 --> 17:09.769
We're so late.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.537
This was supposed to
be done hours ago.

17:11.539 --> 17:13.374
Where the fuck are we, man?

17:14.241 --> 17:14.906
In the woods.

17:16.010 --> 17:17.977
- There's no road.
- Yeah.

17:17.979 --> 17:19.747
We're in the middle of nowhere.

17:20.682 --> 17:22.314
Alright,
Jarrett, go make sure

17:22.316 --> 17:24.416
- everything is taken care of.
- Alright, you got it.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.286
Let me grab this.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.520
Take the
lantern with you.

17:28.690 --> 17:30.322
It's bright.

17:30.324 --> 17:31.691
Oh, oh!

17:31.693 --> 17:33.325
- I'm gonna leave the key, you...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:33.327 --> 17:34.228
Just, just go, go.

17:41.803 --> 17:43.269
Wow.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.804
Thought we'd never make it.

17:45.907 --> 17:46.741
Vinny.

17:47.909 --> 17:50.509
It's time to wake this
son of a bitch up.

17:50.511 --> 17:51.510
Let's do it.

18:07.562 --> 18:08.728
Look, I'm supposed to be

18:08.730 --> 18:09.729
at my wedding rehearsal
dinner right now.

18:09.731 --> 18:10.964
- Hey!
- What?

18:10.966 --> 18:12.331
Calm the fuck down
and keep walking.

18:12.333 --> 18:13.365
Look, guys, if I
don't make that dinner,

18:13.367 --> 18:14.868
my fiancee's gonna kill me.

18:14.870 --> 18:16.770
Let me get this straight,

18:16.772 --> 18:18.637
we're about to blow
your fuckin' brains out

18:18.639 --> 18:21.875
and you're worried about
what your woman might think.

18:21.877 --> 18:23.777
This dude has
some major problems,

18:23.779 --> 18:25.578
he deserves to fuckin' die.

18:30.953 --> 18:32.888
Get down here.

18:39.795 --> 18:43.966
Anybody that's this pathetic,
pussy whipped is pathetic.

18:46.401 --> 18:47.033
I'm not pussy whipped!

18:47.035 --> 18:48.871
I just love my fiancee.

18:49.905 --> 18:51.438
Yeah.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.906
Well.

18:52.908 --> 18:55.742
Any last words before
we end your pathetic

18:55.744 --> 18:57.846
miserable pussy whipped life?

19:00.449 --> 19:02.115
Please, please don't kill me.

19:02.117 --> 19:03.784
Shut the fuck up.

19:03.786 --> 19:05.819
Go out with some fucking
balls, for God's sakes.

19:05.821 --> 19:07.020
Have a little dignity!

19:07.022 --> 19:08.755
I'll, I'll do anything.

19:08.757 --> 19:09.589
Anything!

19:09.591 --> 19:10.690
You'll do anything?

19:11.527 --> 19:12.359
You hear that?

19:12.361 --> 19:13.493
He'll do anything.

19:13.495 --> 19:14.694
He ain't got
nothing that we want.

19:14.696 --> 19:15.796
That's right.

19:15.798 --> 19:16.663
We're not gay.

19:16.665 --> 19:18.932
You can't suck our
fucking dicks off.

19:18.934 --> 19:19.933
Yeah.

19:19.935 --> 19:21.802
Yeah, we're not.

19:21.804 --> 19:23.137
We're not gay.

19:23.139 --> 19:25.605
I'm not, I'm not gay.

19:25.607 --> 19:28.475
Nothing against gay people
but I'm not, you know?

19:28.477 --> 19:30.811
I just, I just don't
wanna suck a dick.

19:30.813 --> 19:32.512
Yeah, well.

19:32.514 --> 19:33.446
I say we kill him like they did

19:33.448 --> 19:35.415
in that movie we like so much.

19:35.417 --> 19:38.585
- Fuckin' Boondocks style.
- Ah, hell yeah!

19:38.587 --> 19:40.922
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

19:42.091 --> 19:44.624
- Oh, god.
- On the count of three.

19:44.626 --> 19:45.927
Three.

19:45.929 --> 19:46.762
Two.

19:47.596 --> 19:48.896
Oh, hold on a sec.

19:48.898 --> 19:49.764
I think we should
show him who we are

19:49.766 --> 19:50.932
before we blow his
fuckin' head off.

19:50.934 --> 19:52.033
What do you say?

19:52.035 --> 19:53.500
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's do it.

19:53.502 --> 19:56.037
Let's take this fuckin'
thing off his head.

19:56.039 --> 19:56.873
What?

20:03.947 --> 20:05.112
Alright.

20:05.114 --> 20:06.881
Turn the fuck around.

20:06.883 --> 20:07.917
Turn around!

20:08.852 --> 20:09.886
That's right.

20:10.787 --> 20:11.919
You ready?

20:12.822 --> 20:14.188
Surprise!

20:14.190 --> 20:16.524
Surprise!

20:16.526 --> 20:17.959
Surprise!

20:17.961 --> 20:18.795
Surprise!

20:19.829 --> 20:20.862
Whoo!

20:26.002 --> 20:27.802
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:27.804 --> 20:29.170
Hey, man, calm the fuck down.

20:29.172 --> 20:30.571
Chill out.

20:35.979 --> 20:37.211
Man.

20:37.213 --> 20:39.146
Did we get you
good or what, huh?

20:39.148 --> 20:41.549
No, you're a sick fuck!

20:41.551 --> 20:44.585
Calm down, man, it's just
a fuckin' bachelor party.

20:44.587 --> 20:45.586
Surprise bachelor party for you.

20:45.588 --> 20:46.888
This is great, Jinx.

20:46.890 --> 20:48.956
You made me miss my
rehearsal dinner.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.725
You know Caroline's
gonna kill me for this.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.961
The whole family came into
town tonight for this.

20:53.963 --> 20:55.096
Listen, man.

20:55.098 --> 20:56.998
How do you think
we pulled this off?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.767
Caroline knew about
it the entire time.

20:59.769 --> 21:00.801
She helped us.

21:00.803 --> 21:02.003
No, you're lying, okay?

21:02.005 --> 21:03.738
Caroline would never
be in on pranks.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.506
Especially something like this.

21:05.508 --> 21:06.841
How do you think that we knew

21:06.843 --> 21:09.877
the exact time that you
take a shit every day?

21:09.879 --> 21:10.878
She told us.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.014
You can call her if you want.

21:12.016 --> 21:13.416
Yeah, I will call her.

21:14.251 --> 21:15.117
Phone?

21:15.119 --> 21:15.986
Do you have mine?

21:17.054 --> 21:18.819
Oh yeah, I do, don't I?

21:18.821 --> 21:19.656
Go for it.

21:23.093 --> 21:25.093
You wanna get
this shit off of me?

21:25.095 --> 21:26.494
I guess that might
help a little bit, huh?

21:26.496 --> 21:27.728
Come on!

21:27.730 --> 21:29.465
Give me a second,
I gotta get my knife.

21:32.770 --> 21:33.735
Shit.

21:33.737 --> 21:34.838
Sorry about that, bro.

21:35.839 --> 21:37.074
I'll buy you a new shirt.

21:41.979 --> 21:43.577
Hi, baby.

21:43.579 --> 21:44.880
How's it goin'?

21:44.882 --> 21:45.814
Hey, sweetie.

21:45.816 --> 21:47.616
I'm so sorry I'm not
home for dinner tonight.

21:47.618 --> 21:50.018
Jinx and a couple of assholes
busted on me this morning

21:50.020 --> 21:51.954
with guns and masks, I fainted,

21:51.956 --> 21:54.056
and drug me out in the
middle of the woods.

21:54.058 --> 21:55.090
Oh, I did wake up at one point

21:55.092 --> 21:56.825
and Jinx fucking
chloroformed me!

21:56.827 --> 21:59.061
Well, yeah, because
you tried to kill us.

21:59.063 --> 22:00.996
He chloroformed
you and you fainted?

22:00.998 --> 22:02.197
Are you okay?

22:02.199 --> 22:03.699
Yeah, I'm okay.

22:03.701 --> 22:05.200
Look, did you know
anything about this?

22:06.036 --> 22:07.736
Just calm down, baby.

22:07.738 --> 22:09.838
I knew everything.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.009
Jinx and I have been
planning this for months.

22:13.677 --> 22:16.078
But you gotta admit, we got
you pretty good, didn't we?

22:16.080 --> 22:16.945
Yeah.

22:16.947 --> 22:19.948
So there is no rehearsal
dinner tonight?

22:19.950 --> 22:20.983
Nope.

22:20.985 --> 22:23.585
That's gonna be next
Friday before the wedding.

22:23.587 --> 22:25.921
Both of our families
were in on it, too.

22:26.957 --> 22:28.623
Now don't worry
about anything else

22:28.625 --> 22:30.759
and just have some
fun with the boys.

22:30.761 --> 22:32.127
For Christ's sake.

22:32.129 --> 22:34.629
And, well, what are
you gonna do tonight?

22:34.631 --> 22:36.031
I mean, I don't like
the idea of you home

22:36.033 --> 22:38.301
all alone without
me all night long.

22:38.303 --> 22:40.136
I'm not home by myself.

22:40.138 --> 22:43.839
I'm over at Cameron's
and Callie's here

22:43.841 --> 22:45.974
and she's helping
me put my makeup on

22:45.976 --> 22:47.778
which is so sweet of her.

22:48.712 --> 22:50.046
It's all good.

22:50.048 --> 22:52.848
Hey, babe, would you put
Jinx on the phone for me?

22:52.850 --> 22:53.985
Okay, honey.

22:57.688 --> 22:58.888
Plan was awesome, scared
the shit out of him.

22:58.890 --> 23:00.025
You should've seen his face.

23:01.192 --> 23:02.959
Yeah, we couldn't have
done it without you.

23:02.961 --> 23:04.861
Jinx, you motherfucker,

23:04.863 --> 23:05.928
you better stick to the plan.

23:05.930 --> 23:07.196
I'm serious.

23:07.198 --> 23:10.833
No booze, no titty
bitches, nothing.

23:10.835 --> 23:12.634
If I find out any
of this is going on,

23:12.636 --> 23:14.137
you will experience
a wrath that you have

23:14.139 --> 23:16.906
never experienced before,
do you understand?

23:16.908 --> 23:18.107
I know, I know.

23:18.109 --> 23:20.076
You've told me a million times.

23:20.078 --> 23:23.179
No alcohol and no
strippers, I got it.

23:23.181 --> 23:26.682
Alright, well you go have some
fun and we'll see you later.

23:26.684 --> 23:27.919
Alright, good night.

23:30.889 --> 23:32.021
This is bullshit, Jinx.

23:32.023 --> 23:33.356
You know what, no.

23:33.358 --> 23:35.124
I'm not doing any of this, okay?

23:35.126 --> 23:37.026
I got some guy I
don't know humping me.

23:37.028 --> 23:37.960
Okay?

23:37.962 --> 23:39.095
You got fuckin' Chad here,

23:39.097 --> 23:40.696
you know how I feel about Chad.

23:40.698 --> 23:42.033
Hey, Pat, what's up, man?

23:43.201 --> 23:45.001
Long time, no talk!

23:45.003 --> 23:45.868
It's fucking freezing.

23:45.870 --> 23:49.105
I have no coat, I
have nothing, no.

23:49.107 --> 23:50.339
Thanks, but no thanks.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.274
Pat, this party
is for you, man.

23:51.276 --> 23:53.242
Just calm down, what the fuck?

23:53.244 --> 23:54.079
Where you goin'?

23:56.748 --> 23:58.815
Guess he didn't like
the surprise, boys.

23:58.817 --> 24:00.118
J-man, hit me that lantern.

24:02.187 --> 24:03.287
Let's get the food started,

24:03.289 --> 24:05.389
I'm gonna have to go chase
after his ass, I guess.

24:05.391 --> 24:06.758
Be back in a few, boys.

24:11.230 --> 24:14.198
That Pat guy's gonna be
high maintenance, ain't he?

24:16.801 --> 24:18.000
Oh, yeah, man.

24:18.002 --> 24:19.171
Some good fire.

24:29.048 --> 24:29.881
Hey, man.

24:31.916 --> 24:32.750
There.

24:33.953 --> 24:34.786
Hey.

24:37.156 --> 24:39.824
Dude, I am like
your biggest fan.

24:41.693 --> 24:43.260
I've seen all of your movies.

24:43.262 --> 24:45.963
I have every last one
of them on Blu-ray.

24:45.965 --> 24:47.898
I've seen 'em all,
like, ten times.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.201
Some even 20 times.

24:54.273 --> 24:55.107
Awesome.

24:56.275 --> 24:57.107
Thanks.

24:57.109 --> 24:57.910
Glad, glad you do.

25:00.713 --> 25:01.347
Do you think that
I could get like a,

25:03.282 --> 25:05.317
like an autograph and
a picture with you?

25:08.254 --> 25:09.820
Pat, Pat, wait up!

25:09.822 --> 25:11.889
- Just calm down, man.
- No, man.

25:11.891 --> 25:13.423
Pat, come on, man.

25:13.425 --> 25:15.826
Dude, we are four hours
away from anywhere.

25:15.828 --> 25:17.294
I don't care!

25:17.296 --> 25:19.096
And you don't have a
car here, where you goin'?

25:19.098 --> 25:21.832
Okay, Jinx, you came
into my house today

25:21.834 --> 25:25.035
and put guns, guns to my head.

25:25.037 --> 25:27.171
And then you got me out
here and who do I see?

25:27.173 --> 25:30.140
Chad and I hate that asshole.

25:30.142 --> 25:32.876
Okay, first of all, those
guns weren't real, man.

25:32.878 --> 25:36.213
They're just movie props that
we used for one of our movies.

25:36.215 --> 25:37.482
They're fake.

25:37.484 --> 25:39.816
And Chad's cool, man.

25:39.818 --> 25:41.486
You guys used to
be best friends.

25:41.488 --> 25:44.222
No, he's a raging atheist.

25:44.224 --> 25:45.956
You know that, right?

25:45.958 --> 25:47.525
Like you can't take
him around anybody

25:47.527 --> 25:49.494
without him trying
to convert you

25:49.496 --> 25:51.229
or he wants you to smoke his pot

25:51.231 --> 25:53.030
or take his ecstasy.

25:53.032 --> 25:54.932
Dude, he's not
like that anymore.

25:54.934 --> 25:56.234
I'm telling you,
I've been hanging out

25:56.236 --> 25:57.435
with him for the last year,

25:57.437 --> 25:59.002
he talks about these
cool restaurants

25:59.004 --> 26:01.272
that he eats at in
Austin and, you know,

26:01.274 --> 26:03.006
we have a lot in common
with independent films.

26:03.008 --> 26:04.075
He tells me about
all these films

26:04.077 --> 26:06.077
I've never heard of and
they're, they're cool, man.

26:06.079 --> 26:07.011
He's cool.

26:07.013 --> 26:08.513
Mmhmm, that's great.

26:08.515 --> 26:10.881
Well, he better not
start anything, okay?

26:10.883 --> 26:14.052
40 bucks for both.

26:14.054 --> 26:15.322
F-O-R-T-Y.

26:16.990 --> 26:19.192
I'm an actor, that's
why I get paid.

26:22.162 --> 26:26.364
Well, yeah, like I said
I'm your biggest fan, I,

26:26.366 --> 26:28.800
and I bought all your movies.

26:28.802 --> 26:30.235
Yeah.

26:30.237 --> 26:34.975
I mean, I hear all that but
that doesn't mean shit to me.

26:36.276 --> 26:37.377
See, I don't make a dime

26:38.478 --> 26:40.213
out of those things
that you buy.

26:41.481 --> 26:44.517
See they cook the
fucking books so bad,

26:46.253 --> 26:48.388
my last check was
almost a nickel.

26:50.123 --> 26:50.957
You know?

26:52.259 --> 26:54.025
Hey.

26:54.027 --> 26:56.229
Do you want that
autograph and pic or what?

26:57.831 --> 26:59.230
Oh yeah, yeah, uh.

26:59.232 --> 27:00.365
Yeah, hold on.

27:00.367 --> 27:01.332
Yeah, let me.

27:01.334 --> 27:04.170
I think I, I think I
got the cash somewhere.

27:05.305 --> 27:09.073
There's one, it's
ripped but it's still

27:09.075 --> 27:10.008
like it'll, yeah.

27:10.010 --> 27:12.110
I think it's the serial numbers.

27:12.112 --> 27:13.345
What you got there?

27:13.347 --> 27:14.613
I just, that's,
I think that's two.

27:14.615 --> 27:16.180
That's three, that's three!

27:16.182 --> 27:17.181
Here!

27:17.183 --> 27:18.484
Good start.

27:18.486 --> 27:19.318
What else you got?

27:19.320 --> 27:20.519
You know what?

27:20.521 --> 27:21.453
I'm just gonna
look in my wallet.

27:21.455 --> 27:23.187
I need just 20 more bucks.

27:23.189 --> 27:24.390
- You got 20 more?
- Yeah, I usually

27:24.392 --> 27:25.923
keep money in here, I think.

27:25.925 --> 27:27.158
Yeah, I do.

27:27.160 --> 27:27.992
Yeah, I have some.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.196
Yeah, hold on, let me.

27:31.365 --> 27:32.164
Bingo!

27:32.166 --> 27:33.965
It's just 20
bucks right there.

27:33.967 --> 27:35.200
- Just right there.
- Just looked in the wallet.

27:35.202 --> 27:38.137
Alright, you got it,
thank you very much.

27:38.139 --> 27:41.342
- Um, I'll keep this one.
- Mmhmm.

27:43.877 --> 27:46.178
There you go, yeah, hold that.

27:46.180 --> 27:47.012
There you go.

27:47.014 --> 27:48.215
Alright, there you go.

27:49.583 --> 27:51.050
Here's your Sharpie.

27:51.052 --> 27:51.883
Here's your DVD.

27:51.885 --> 27:53.319
Yeah, Vinny, thanks.

27:53.321 --> 27:55.954
Um, is, uh?

27:55.956 --> 27:56.588
What does it?

27:56.590 --> 27:57.458
What does it say?

27:58.592 --> 27:59.859
Vinny Blades.

28:02.897 --> 28:05.097
Well, it just
looks like a line.

28:05.099 --> 28:06.131
No.

28:06.133 --> 28:07.399
- It's, yeah.
- Hey.

28:07.401 --> 28:10.069
- There's more there.
- How about that pic?

28:10.071 --> 28:11.303
Okay.

28:11.305 --> 28:13.105
Oh yeah, I gotta
switch it around.

28:13.107 --> 28:13.972
Okay, alright.

28:13.974 --> 28:14.606
Alright.

28:14.608 --> 28:15.441
Here we go.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.475
Here we go.

28:16.477 --> 28:17.276
Hey!

28:17.278 --> 28:19.880
- Good job, alright, man.
- Uh.

28:21.349 --> 28:24.684
- Wait, wait, Mr, Mr. Blades?
- Blades.

28:24.686 --> 28:26.452
Blades, um.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.987
Well, you walked
away right as I was

28:28.989 --> 28:30.255
pushing the button so it's,

28:30.257 --> 28:31.990
I mean, it's just
a picture of me.

28:31.992 --> 28:35.027
So, like, you went away
and then it flashed

28:35.029 --> 28:39.566
a picture and so, you see,
it's just a picture of me.

28:39.568 --> 28:41.068
And you're gone out of it.

28:42.203 --> 28:43.001
That's unfortunate.

28:43.003 --> 28:44.336
Yeah, um.

28:44.338 --> 28:45.971
So do you mind if
we take another one?

28:45.973 --> 28:47.339
So I can get you in there?

28:47.341 --> 28:48.508
Hey, not at all.

28:48.510 --> 28:49.343
20 more dollars.

28:53.948 --> 28:55.382
What?

28:55.384 --> 28:57.116
Look, I'm not into it, okay?

28:57.118 --> 28:58.551
It's freezing out here.

28:58.553 --> 29:00.052
I have no jacket.

29:00.054 --> 29:01.454
I mean, I still don't
feel very well either.

29:01.456 --> 29:02.288
You wanna know why?

29:02.290 --> 29:04.290
Because you chloroformed
me, remember?

29:04.292 --> 29:06.026
That was chloroform, right?

29:07.429 --> 29:09.128
To be honest, man,
I'm not really sure.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.196
Are you kidding me?

29:10.198 --> 29:12.432
But Vinny wouldn't do
anything that was dangerous

29:12.434 --> 29:15.168
to hurt you, he
wouldn't do that, man.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.269
You probably just
feel a little weird

29:16.271 --> 29:17.504
'cause you didn't have

29:17.506 --> 29:18.673
anything to eat for
breakfast, obviously.

29:20.242 --> 29:21.508
Let's just get some food in you

29:21.510 --> 29:24.043
and come back over, we
got a jacket for you.

29:24.045 --> 29:25.512
- Come on.
- You're a dick.

29:25.514 --> 29:26.348
Come on.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.526
So this spot is
actually the first spot

29:39.528 --> 29:42.529
that they ever saw
Bigfoot in North America

29:42.531 --> 29:44.664
back in, like, the
1800s, I think?

29:44.666 --> 29:46.733
It was supposed to be
like a hoax at first,

29:46.735 --> 29:48.334
everybody thought it'd be a hoax

29:48.336 --> 29:49.235
but all these accounts
started coming in after that,

29:49.237 --> 29:51.571
like just one after
another and another.

29:51.573 --> 29:54.374
There was this one
story of a lumberjack

29:54.376 --> 29:57.010
who got, basically,
just like captured

29:57.012 --> 29:59.412
- by a whole family of Bigfoot.
- Bigfeet.

29:59.414 --> 30:00.647
- What?
- Bigfeet.

30:00.649 --> 30:03.218
Family of Bigfeet,
you said Bigfoot, but.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.520
It's plural, so Bigfeet.

30:07.055 --> 30:11.424
Like when you don't
say a bunch of mouses,

30:11.426 --> 30:12.492
you say a bunch of mice.

30:12.494 --> 30:14.060
Are you sure
that's the same thing

30:14.062 --> 30:16.095
with Bigfoot as it is with that?

30:16.097 --> 30:17.330
Yeah, it's plural, right?

30:17.332 --> 30:18.164
Moose, Meeses?

30:18.166 --> 30:20.568
Guys, alright.

30:20.570 --> 30:21.469
He got captured by
more than one Bigfoot.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.336
- Thank you.
- Okay.

30:23.338 --> 30:24.372
So anyways, um.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.040
He said that they were actually

30:27.042 --> 30:28.709
peaceful creatures, you know?

30:28.711 --> 30:31.579
And vegetarians.

30:31.581 --> 30:33.683
I always thought that was funny.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.151
Anyways, so yeah, so
they kept him captive

30:38.153 --> 30:41.322
for like a week before
he managed to escape.

30:41.324 --> 30:42.790
I mean, you know, with
all the Bigfoot stories

30:42.792 --> 30:45.459
- and what not, I guess.
- Are you serious?

30:45.461 --> 30:46.727
What?

30:46.729 --> 30:47.530
I mean.

30:49.499 --> 30:52.201
Nobody's seriously gonna
fucking talk about this?

30:54.837 --> 30:56.303
Chad.

30:56.305 --> 30:59.507
Dude, don't start any
shit tonight, okay?

30:59.509 --> 31:00.808
Dude, you promised me, okay?

31:00.810 --> 31:03.410
Just shh, be cool, be cool.

31:03.412 --> 31:05.279
I mean, do you
really believe that?

31:05.281 --> 31:06.580
Yeah.

31:06.582 --> 31:07.748
Okay.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.183
Can't we have an intelligent

31:09.185 --> 31:10.384
conversation about
something else?

31:10.386 --> 31:13.287
No, we cannot have an intelligent
conversation tonight.

31:13.289 --> 31:14.788
Okay, this is just
about kicking back,

31:14.790 --> 31:16.824
having a good time
and shootin' the shit.

31:16.826 --> 31:18.392
Just having fun, okay?

31:18.394 --> 31:20.127
We don't have to
have talk science

31:20.129 --> 31:22.630
and all that bullshit, okay?

31:22.632 --> 31:25.099
So just, just let him talk.

31:25.101 --> 31:26.634
Okay?

31:26.636 --> 31:28.269
So, yeah, you know there's
been thousands of accounts,

31:28.271 --> 31:30.872
you know, over time, I mean,
the miners up in the mines.

31:30.874 --> 31:33.641
Uh, stories of, you know,
people just like us,

31:33.643 --> 31:35.676
just sittin' around
the campfire,

31:35.678 --> 31:36.745
hearing weird shit in the woods

31:36.747 --> 31:39.346
and, you know, like
rocks and sticks

31:39.348 --> 31:40.581
getting thrown at
their tents and stuff.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.448
I mean, it's just.

31:41.450 --> 31:44.151
Yeah, those
people are lying.

31:44.153 --> 31:46.120
- Whatever, Chad.
- No, I mean, come on.

31:46.122 --> 31:47.689
I mean, think about it.

31:47.691 --> 31:50.391
Out of thousands of sightings,

31:50.393 --> 31:53.895
the only proof we have out
of thousands of sightings

31:53.897 --> 31:58.633
is some blurry
photographs and one video

31:58.635 --> 32:01.703
of Bigfoot, you know,
walking all retarded.

32:01.705 --> 32:02.539
Not retarded.

32:04.140 --> 32:05.542
My sister is autistic.

32:06.710 --> 32:09.678
Mentally handicapped, please.

32:09.680 --> 32:10.712
Yeah, man.

32:10.714 --> 32:11.648
My niece, his sister.

32:12.649 --> 32:13.582
- What the fuck?
- Okay, yes,

32:13.584 --> 32:17.652
but regardless, it's one video

32:17.654 --> 32:21.823
of Bigfoot, you know.

32:21.825 --> 32:24.859
I mean that shit looks so fake!

32:24.861 --> 32:25.794
Chad!

32:25.796 --> 32:28.296
I am fucking serious, man!

32:28.298 --> 32:30.599
Just keep your
opinions to yourself.

32:30.601 --> 32:32.601
Yeah, man, just let
him talk, alright?

32:32.603 --> 32:34.636
We're just chilling, alright?

32:34.638 --> 32:36.440
Having a good time, alright?

32:37.574 --> 32:39.407
I mean, I love Bigfoot.

32:39.409 --> 32:40.375
Thanks, man.

32:40.377 --> 32:44.114
And aliens and ghosts, I mean.

32:45.215 --> 32:45.947
As a matter of
fact, I got a ghost

32:45.949 --> 32:47.749
living in my house right now.

32:47.751 --> 32:49.517
Uncle does, too!

32:49.519 --> 32:50.585
Tell 'em about it.

32:50.587 --> 32:51.720
Yeah, that's right.

32:51.722 --> 32:53.557
I do have a ghost.

32:54.758 --> 32:55.890
It was about three
o'clock in the afternoon

32:55.892 --> 32:57.592
and I was taking a nap.

32:57.594 --> 32:58.593
All of a sudden the bedroom door

32:58.595 --> 33:00.896
- just swung right open.
- Wow.

33:00.898 --> 33:02.898
I thought at first
it must be the cat

33:02.900 --> 33:05.901
or, you know, my wife playing
a joke on me or something.

33:05.903 --> 33:07.837
But the wife wasn't
home and the cat

33:07.839 --> 33:09.404
was sleeping right next to me.

33:09.406 --> 33:10.973
So I thought, well,
maybe a breeze came in,

33:10.975 --> 33:13.876
maybe the door was open
or something or a window.

33:13.878 --> 33:16.678
Checked all the
windows, doors, nope.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.883
There was no fucking
explanation of what it was.

33:19.984 --> 33:21.251
I'm tellin' you, man.

33:21.986 --> 33:23.385
Fuckin' ghost.

33:23.387 --> 33:25.286
You're lucky, man,
because my ghost

33:25.288 --> 33:26.590
scared the shit out of me.

33:27.792 --> 33:31.493
It would, like, turn on
appliances around the house,

33:31.495 --> 33:33.765
knock shit off the
walls, move furniture.

33:35.399 --> 33:38.000
As a matter of fact, I think
one time it tried to kill me.

33:38.002 --> 33:39.434
- I swear to God.
- What?

33:39.436 --> 33:40.603
Yeah.

33:40.605 --> 33:41.570
- I went out...
- Some heavy shit.

33:41.572 --> 33:44.774
No, I went outside
to go check the mail,

33:44.776 --> 33:47.743
I come right back the
house smells like gas.

33:47.745 --> 33:49.244
So sure enough, I
go to the kitchen

33:49.246 --> 33:52.448
and gas stove right
there and the knob

33:52.450 --> 33:55.551
is slightly turned
releasing gas.

33:55.553 --> 33:57.220
And you couldn't
have done that?

33:58.389 --> 33:59.588
No.

33:59.590 --> 34:00.656
Yeah, but you couldn't
have accidentally

34:00.658 --> 34:02.658
- brushed the knob?
- No.

34:02.660 --> 34:04.293
I was not in the kitchen.

34:05.830 --> 34:07.296
That's not the point.

34:07.298 --> 34:09.799
Well, maybe you didn't
turn it off all the way

34:09.801 --> 34:11.567
and then you didn't
notice until it started

34:11.569 --> 34:12.802
filling up with gas over time...

34:12.804 --> 34:13.969
Dude.

34:13.971 --> 34:15.438
Relax.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.672
Regardless, I got
rid of the ghost.

34:17.675 --> 34:19.375
So how'd you get rid of it?

34:19.377 --> 34:20.842
You wanna know
how I got rid of it?

34:20.844 --> 34:21.944
Well, yeah.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.723
It's like a scene
in one of my movies.

34:35.359 --> 34:37.360
I looked at it right
in its ghostly eyes

34:40.864 --> 34:41.766
and I said,

34:43.801 --> 34:45.670
- get the fuck out.
- Shit!

34:47.638 --> 34:49.072
Awesome, awesome!

34:49.074 --> 34:50.005
That's cool.

34:50.007 --> 34:51.741
That's what I'm talking about.

34:51.743 --> 34:53.978
I mean, I didn't
get rid of it but

34:55.313 --> 34:56.880
it sure shut the
fuck up for awhile.

34:56.882 --> 34:59.548
Wow, nice.

34:59.550 --> 35:00.817
Yeah, man, I believe in UFOs.

35:00.819 --> 35:02.886
I've seen a UFO.

35:02.888 --> 35:05.021
Unidentified Flying Objects.

35:05.023 --> 35:06.757
No shit, I really saw it.

35:06.759 --> 35:07.991
I really did.

35:07.993 --> 35:08.959
Seriously.

35:08.961 --> 35:10.459
- Very good.
- Saw it.

35:10.461 --> 35:11.797
And, uh, I could tell you,

35:13.431 --> 35:16.800
it made me realize there's
something bigger out there.

35:16.802 --> 35:17.801
Okay?

35:17.803 --> 35:19.770
And I believe in Bigfoot.

35:19.772 --> 35:21.370
There you go.

35:21.372 --> 35:23.840
You don't seriously
believe in this shit.

35:23.842 --> 35:26.910
I mean use your fuckin' brains.

35:26.912 --> 35:28.779
Are none of you educated?

35:28.781 --> 35:32.516
I mean, what the fuck is
wrong with you people?

35:32.518 --> 35:33.850
I'm educated.

35:33.852 --> 35:35.452
It doesn't take a
scientist to know

35:35.454 --> 35:36.853
that the gravitational
pull could

35:36.855 --> 35:39.856
cause some crazy
mutations on our planet.

35:39.858 --> 35:42.526
Could explain things
like the chupacabra,

35:42.528 --> 35:45.428
loch ness monster,
vampires, werewolves.

35:45.430 --> 35:47.531
- Kim Kardashian's ass.
- Yeah!

35:47.533 --> 35:49.099
That's unreal.

35:49.101 --> 35:50.000
Okay, you know what?

35:50.002 --> 35:51.935
That's it, that's it.

35:51.937 --> 35:53.770
I can't take any more of this.

35:53.772 --> 35:55.605
Alright, I mean you
people can't tell me

35:55.607 --> 35:58.809
you actually believe what
the fuck you're saying

35:58.811 --> 36:02.712
because science has
proven you wrong over,

36:02.714 --> 36:03.814
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:03.816 --> 36:08.754
Because science has proven
you wrong over and over

36:09.855 --> 36:11.788
and over and there's
not one ounce,

36:11.790 --> 36:14.424
not one fucking shred of proof

36:14.426 --> 36:17.828
that any of you have
any fucking idea

36:17.830 --> 36:19.830
about what you're talking about.

36:19.832 --> 36:22.632
Dude, shut the fuck up, okay?

36:22.634 --> 36:23.733
Just shut the fuck up.

36:23.735 --> 36:25.735
I mean if it wasn't for my ghost

36:25.737 --> 36:27.404
to scare off the wrong woman,

36:27.406 --> 36:29.606
I could've married
the fucking bitch

36:29.608 --> 36:30.875
and that would've
been the death of me.

36:30.877 --> 36:32.542
- So calm down.
- Guys!

36:32.544 --> 36:33.813
That is enough, okay?

36:35.048 --> 36:37.849
Now I told you, you could come
if you didn't start any shit

36:37.851 --> 36:39.884
and that's all you've
been doing all night.

36:39.886 --> 36:42.653
This is Pat's bachelor party.

36:42.655 --> 36:43.620
You gave me your word, man.

36:43.622 --> 36:46.190
And all you're doing is
pissing everybody off.

36:46.192 --> 36:48.826
You're pissin' off Vinny,
you're pissin' off Pat.

36:48.828 --> 36:50.928
You're pissin' off my
nephew, Jarrett, and me!

36:50.930 --> 36:52.797
What the fuck is wrong with you?

36:52.799 --> 36:54.532
Just sit the fuck down.

36:54.534 --> 36:57.835
Just sit the fuck down,
sit the fuck down, man.

36:57.837 --> 36:59.871
Jesus Christ, what's
wrong with you?

36:59.873 --> 37:01.839
No, no, I'm not gonna do that

37:01.841 --> 37:05.042
because I'm not gonna let you
do that to yourselves, okay?

37:05.044 --> 37:06.510
Because, you know, get your

37:06.512 --> 37:09.046
fuckin' head out of
the clouds, people.

37:09.048 --> 37:11.883
Let me do you a
favor here, okay?

37:11.885 --> 37:14.585
There is no fucking Santa Claus,

37:14.587 --> 37:16.621
there's not fucking
Easter Bunny.

37:16.623 --> 37:19.924
- There's no Tooth Fairy...
- Chad, I swear to God,

37:19.926 --> 37:21.158
you better quit
while you're ahead

37:21.160 --> 37:23.227
because if the next
word out of your mouth

37:23.229 --> 37:25.863
- is God...
- There's no God either,

37:25.865 --> 37:27.999
you fuckin' Jesus freak.

37:28.001 --> 37:30.202
- Ooh!
- Ooh, shit.

37:30.204 --> 37:32.870
- It's about time!
- It's a great party, Jinx.

37:32.872 --> 37:34.038
Man, he gave me
his word, okay?

37:34.040 --> 37:37.041
I'm sorry, I didn't know he
was gonna be a fuckin' dick.

37:37.043 --> 37:39.244
It's a good thing I took 60
bucks off that motherfucker.

37:40.914 --> 37:41.948
Alright.

37:42.815 --> 37:44.049
Help me get this asshole.

37:44.051 --> 37:45.716
Here.

37:45.718 --> 37:48.053
You get his legs and
I'll get his upper body.

37:48.055 --> 37:49.889
- Okay.
- Then we turn him over.

37:51.925 --> 37:52.857
Oh shit, give me a second.

37:52.859 --> 37:54.092
Oh yeah, he's real light.

37:54.094 --> 37:57.528
Yeah, of course he is, cause
you've got the fuckin' legs.

37:57.530 --> 37:58.663
God damn, it's heavy for me.

37:58.665 --> 37:59.967
I need to workout, fuck.

38:01.135 --> 38:03.801
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

38:03.803 --> 38:06.671
What the hell are you
boys doing out here?

38:06.673 --> 38:08.739
And what the hell
happened to him?

38:08.741 --> 38:09.609
Uh.

38:10.978 --> 38:13.577
Hi, officer, I think
everything's alright here.

38:13.579 --> 38:14.748
Nothing to worry about.

38:15.883 --> 38:17.950
This guy, he's just had a
little too much to drink.

38:17.952 --> 38:18.951
He's a friend of ours.

38:18.953 --> 38:22.888
Just, just wanted to let
him sleep it off, okay?

38:22.890 --> 38:23.755
We were just about to
put him in the tent

38:23.757 --> 38:26.224
and I can vouch for
his health totally,

38:26.226 --> 38:28.193
I used to be a medic
in Afghanistan.

38:28.195 --> 38:31.096
Yeah, well, you're in
a No Trespassing zone

38:31.098 --> 38:33.865
and that's a 300 dollar
fine for each of you.

38:33.867 --> 38:34.967
And that doesn't even include

38:34.969 --> 38:37.569
what the sheriff will do
if he catches you out here.

38:37.571 --> 38:40.605
He will lock you up in
jail until the judge

38:40.607 --> 38:43.008
comes in on Monday morning.

38:43.010 --> 38:46.311
Uh, ma'am, can I
just come over there

38:46.313 --> 38:47.746
and talk to you for a second?

38:47.748 --> 38:50.816
Vinny, can Vinny and
this guy just put

38:50.818 --> 38:52.751
Chad in his tent so he can rest?

38:52.753 --> 38:54.720
He needs to go in the tent.

38:54.722 --> 38:58.056
Yeah, I just wanna have a
quick word with you, ma'am.

38:58.058 --> 38:59.257
Okay, but don't touch me.

38:59.259 --> 39:00.859
Okay, don't touch me.

39:00.861 --> 39:02.127
Ma'am, I'm over here.

39:02.129 --> 39:03.829
My hands are right here,
I'm not gonna touch you.

39:03.831 --> 39:05.130
How's that?

39:05.132 --> 39:06.064
- That work?
- Alright.

39:06.066 --> 39:07.032
Don't touch her, Uncle.

39:07.034 --> 39:08.600
Do you want 'em behind
my head, is that okay?

39:08.602 --> 39:09.835
Don't touch me!

39:09.837 --> 39:11.270
Okay, hands are
behind my head.

39:11.272 --> 39:12.938
I'm coming.

39:12.940 --> 39:14.140
Could you, could you maybe turn
off the light a little bit?

39:14.142 --> 39:15.141
It's really bright, I can't.

39:15.143 --> 39:17.009
It's blinding me, ma'am.

39:17.011 --> 39:18.577
Okay, but I got a gun.

39:18.579 --> 39:20.045
Yeah, I can see that gun,

39:20.047 --> 39:23.118
I'm not gonna, I'm
not gonna do anything.

39:26.121 --> 39:28.087
- Still got my gun.
- Thank you.

39:28.089 --> 39:29.088
Yeah, hi.

39:29.090 --> 39:31.124
I can see you got the gun there.

39:31.126 --> 39:33.261
Would you mind lowering that?

39:34.695 --> 39:36.162
Okay.

39:36.164 --> 39:36.996
Thank you.

39:36.998 --> 39:38.864
Can I lower my hands?

39:38.866 --> 39:39.999
Slowly.

39:40.001 --> 39:42.203
Alright, just wanna grab
my wallet here real quick.

39:44.339 --> 39:46.172
I was thinking, we
could, you know, we could

39:46.174 --> 39:49.809
- maybe work something out.
- Oh no, I don't take bribes.

39:49.811 --> 39:51.179
- You sure?
- Mmhmm.

39:52.947 --> 39:54.380
Maybe we could just talk then?

39:54.382 --> 39:56.015
Oh, you're not talking
yourself out of this.

39:56.017 --> 39:57.984
This is a No Trespassing zone.

39:57.986 --> 39:59.919
Restricted Area, it
says right there.

39:59.921 --> 40:00.855
Do not enter.

40:01.823 --> 40:03.758
Oh, it sure as hell does.

40:04.959 --> 40:09.629
You know, we came
in over there, so.

40:09.631 --> 40:10.832
We didn't see that sign.

40:12.967 --> 40:16.069
My buddy over there, Pat, he's,

40:16.071 --> 40:18.037
he's about to make the
biggest mistake of his life

40:18.039 --> 40:20.073
and he's gonna marry
the wrong woman

40:20.075 --> 40:21.974
and I just thought
I'd bring him out here

40:21.976 --> 40:23.142
and show him one last good time

40:23.144 --> 40:25.044
before his, you
know, his funeral.

40:25.046 --> 40:26.245
It's kind of a
bachelor party for him.

40:26.247 --> 40:28.848
A bachelor party?

40:28.850 --> 40:30.384
In the middle of the woods?

40:30.386 --> 40:32.819
Fuckin' Jinx.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.854
You better get us out of this.

40:34.856 --> 40:36.089
Don't worry about it.

40:36.091 --> 40:37.156
This will be fine.

40:37.158 --> 40:38.124
Pussy whipped.

40:38.126 --> 40:41.229
I mean, uh, he's so whipped.

40:43.898 --> 40:46.132
Well, she's kind of controlling

40:46.134 --> 40:48.134
and doesn't really
let him do much

40:48.136 --> 40:50.837
and the only thing
that she would allow

40:50.839 --> 40:52.339
me to do for the bachelor party

40:52.341 --> 40:54.774
was to, you know, bring
him out here camping.

40:54.776 --> 40:56.742
Uncle will get us
out of this, okay?

40:56.744 --> 40:59.146
Uncle's, Uncle knows
what he's doing.

40:59.148 --> 41:01.281
Just, you know
take him out here.

41:01.283 --> 41:03.049
Oh, uh.

41:03.051 --> 41:05.718
You happen to know that
actor, Vinny Blades?

41:05.720 --> 41:07.254
You know that guy that stars

41:07.256 --> 41:08.955
in all those Switchblade movies?

41:08.957 --> 41:10.690
They're kind of goofy but
have you ever seen 'em?

41:10.692 --> 41:11.992
Vinny Blades?

41:11.994 --> 41:13.260
Oh my God, he's like my

41:13.262 --> 41:14.962
most favorite actor
in the whole world.

41:14.964 --> 41:16.796
He's got those bedroom eyes.

41:16.798 --> 41:18.065
That's the guy
I'm talking about.

41:18.067 --> 41:21.101
Well, if you look
right over there.

41:21.103 --> 41:23.003
- That's him.
- Oh my God!

41:23.005 --> 41:25.105
Do you think I could
get his autograph?

41:25.107 --> 41:26.206
I could probably arrange that

41:26.208 --> 41:27.908
if you wanna work something out.

41:27.910 --> 41:32.246
What I was thinking is,
you let us stay all night

41:32.248 --> 41:34.281
and we'll leave in the morning.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.116
First light, what do you say?

41:36.118 --> 41:37.251
Well, as long as you swear

41:37.253 --> 41:38.485
you'll be gone in the morning,

41:38.487 --> 41:40.854
I don't see how it
would be a problem.

41:40.856 --> 41:43.090
- So we got a deal?
- Deal.

41:43.092 --> 41:43.924
Alright.

41:43.926 --> 41:45.392
Very good.

41:45.394 --> 41:47.161
Hey, uh, Vinny.

41:47.163 --> 41:51.031
Could you come over here
and meet a superfan?

41:51.033 --> 41:54.134
She's a superfan of
yours and, if you could,

41:54.136 --> 41:55.836
bring one of those
super delicious brownies

41:55.838 --> 41:57.373
that you make homemade.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.746
Yeah, that is Vinny Blades.

42:04.413 --> 42:05.414
Vinny Blades!

42:07.183 --> 42:08.048
Oh.

42:08.050 --> 42:09.417
Howdy, ma'am.

42:09.419 --> 42:10.920
Always good to meet a fan.

42:14.290 --> 42:15.324
Oh.

42:17.026 --> 42:20.328
I got this, uh, homemade
brownie just for you.

42:20.330 --> 42:25.335
Vinny, that is the extra
extra special brownie, right?

42:26.001 --> 42:27.000
Yeah.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.869
Hey, it's not my first rodeo.

42:28.871 --> 42:30.103
This is one tasty brownie.

42:30.105 --> 42:32.207
This is one of the
best I've ever eaten.

42:32.209 --> 42:33.210
Mm, mmhmm.

42:35.245 --> 42:38.179
Uh, listen, Vinny,
I was kinda thinking

42:38.181 --> 42:40.881
that maybe you
could, uh, you know

42:40.883 --> 42:44.252
take a couple pics with her
and give her an autograph.

42:44.254 --> 42:45.288
What do you say?

42:49.526 --> 42:50.358
Aw, come on, man.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.328
You know, it's for me.

42:53.330 --> 42:54.562
You know.

42:54.564 --> 42:55.365
Special favor.

42:56.266 --> 42:58.066
I owe you one, okay?

42:58.068 --> 42:58.967
Why not?

42:58.969 --> 42:59.934
Hmm?

42:59.936 --> 43:00.937
Would you sign my chest?

43:02.372 --> 43:05.375
It is my specialty.

43:06.910 --> 43:07.743
Alright.

43:09.546 --> 43:11.381
Fucking fans of his.

43:13.850 --> 43:15.185
Vinny.

43:16.586 --> 43:17.420
Blades.

43:19.256 --> 43:20.855
Oh, when I get
off in the morning,

43:20.857 --> 43:24.292
I am so getting this permanently
tattooed on my breasts.

43:24.294 --> 43:25.159
We're in the
same fuckin' movie,

43:25.161 --> 43:26.594
I don't get to sign
no fuckin' titties.

43:26.596 --> 43:27.962
Hell yeah.

43:27.964 --> 43:29.430
That's what I'm talking about.

43:29.432 --> 43:31.034
A true fan.

43:32.202 --> 43:33.503
Of course, of course.

43:35.372 --> 43:37.438
Hey, why don't you come by
the fire over there with us?

43:37.440 --> 43:38.875
It's nice and toasty.

43:42.946 --> 43:45.313
What a fuckin' douchebag.

43:45.315 --> 43:46.816
Jesus Christ.

43:50.621 --> 43:52.355
Do you got anything to drink?

43:53.323 --> 43:54.525
Got this awesome sauce.

43:56.092 --> 43:56.924
No.

43:56.926 --> 43:58.126
Caroline doesn't let me,

43:58.128 --> 43:59.428
like it when I drink.

43:59.430 --> 44:00.462
Hey.

44:00.464 --> 44:01.399
How's that brownie?

44:03.033 --> 44:04.165
Timmy.

44:04.167 --> 44:05.334
It's great brownie.

44:05.336 --> 44:07.137
- Vinny.
- Right.

44:08.239 --> 44:09.271
Dude.

44:09.273 --> 44:11.340
- Just have a beer, bro.
- Yeah.

44:11.342 --> 44:13.043
- Thanks, man.
- Nice catch.

44:21.352 --> 44:23.552
Would you like a beer to
wash down that tasty brownie?

44:23.554 --> 44:25.056
No, I'm on duty.

44:26.624 --> 44:29.124
Have you ever seen a Bigfoot?

44:29.126 --> 44:30.561
Or like a family of Bigfeet?

44:31.529 --> 44:33.462
No, it's Bigfoot.

44:33.464 --> 44:34.630
Bigfoot.

44:34.632 --> 44:36.932
And, bro, she can't
tell you that.

44:36.934 --> 44:38.367
It's top secret.

44:38.369 --> 44:40.002
It's not top secret.

44:40.004 --> 44:41.270
Then why are there all
these signs around here

44:41.272 --> 44:43.138
that say Restricted
Area: Do Not Enter?

44:43.140 --> 44:45.174
Because all these
redneck hunters

44:45.176 --> 44:46.575
are coming around here
trying to kill Bigfoot

44:46.577 --> 44:48.210
for a million dollars
and they're putting

44:48.212 --> 44:50.012
bear traps out and
hurting people.

44:50.014 --> 44:51.213
Really?

44:51.215 --> 44:53.282
There's fuckin'
bear traps out here?

44:53.284 --> 44:54.118
Great.

44:55.186 --> 44:56.387
What the fuck is that?

44:58.489 --> 45:00.222
What is that?

45:01.292 --> 45:04.495
Sounds like fuckin'
chimp sounds or something.

45:05.429 --> 45:07.630
You don't have monkeys
out here, do you?

45:07.632 --> 45:08.497
No.

45:08.499 --> 45:09.533
No monkeys.

45:11.268 --> 45:12.203
Shh, shh.

45:13.337 --> 45:14.671
Shh.

45:16.307 --> 45:17.940
Wolves.

45:17.942 --> 45:18.577
It's wolves.

45:20.444 --> 45:22.044
Werewolves.

45:22.046 --> 45:24.246
No, no werewolves, no Bigfoot,

45:24.248 --> 45:26.382
it's probably just
a couple of coyotes.

45:26.384 --> 45:28.117
It's cay-oats.

45:28.119 --> 45:31.621
It's cay-oats not coyotes,
it's cay-oat country.

45:32.691 --> 45:33.625
Cay-oat country.

45:36.561 --> 45:39.096
Whatever the fuck it
is, it's getting closer.

45:40.632 --> 45:42.097
Yeah.

45:42.099 --> 45:43.033
He's right.

45:45.470 --> 45:46.904
It's right there.

45:50.975 --> 45:52.977
What the fuck is that?

45:55.447 --> 45:56.548
Who's out there?

45:57.716 --> 46:01.219
You better show yourself cause
I'm a badass park ranger.

46:02.554 --> 46:04.489
- She's a badass.
- Shh!

46:05.424 --> 46:07.257
What is that?

46:07.259 --> 46:08.558
What the fuck is that light?

46:08.560 --> 46:11.261
It's fuckin' glowing
in the dark, man.

46:11.263 --> 46:12.562
It might be one of
those fuckin' aliens,

46:12.564 --> 46:14.232
y'all were talking
about earlier.

46:15.367 --> 46:16.268
Switchblade your ass.

46:19.004 --> 46:21.206
Fucking put a curse
on this fucking thing.

46:22.374 --> 46:24.374
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

46:24.376 --> 46:26.409
Alright, boys, get ready.

46:26.411 --> 46:28.578
Or we'll fuck your alien ass up!

46:28.580 --> 46:29.712
She's got the gun.

46:29.714 --> 46:31.147
She goes first.

46:31.149 --> 46:31.748
You, you shoot that
son of a bitch, alright?

46:31.750 --> 46:34.083
Mmhmm, mmhmm, mmhmm.

46:34.085 --> 46:35.018
Whoo!

46:35.020 --> 46:36.085
I got you, boys!

46:36.721 --> 46:37.620
It was the strippers.

46:37.622 --> 46:39.522
- Oh.
- Oh my God.

46:39.524 --> 46:41.124
Yeah, whoo!

46:41.126 --> 46:42.559
The strippers.

46:42.561 --> 46:44.527
- Fucking party time!
- You have strippers?

46:44.529 --> 46:46.630
Yes, time to get
this party started.

46:46.632 --> 46:49.600
No, you told me this was
just a party in the woods.

46:49.602 --> 46:52.770
I said bachelor party for
my pussy whipped friend.

46:52.772 --> 46:54.370
Remember?

46:54.372 --> 46:55.305
It wouldn't be a bachelor
party if we didn't

46:55.307 --> 46:57.073
have some strippers, right?

46:57.075 --> 46:58.475
I'm gonna get in
so much trouble.

46:58.477 --> 47:00.143
You're not gonna
get in any trouble.

47:00.145 --> 47:01.679
Just hang out with us.

47:01.681 --> 47:03.581
Eat another brownie, you know?

47:03.583 --> 47:04.682
Vinny's got some more
of those brownies

47:04.684 --> 47:06.517
- and you love that brownie.
- I like those brownies.

47:06.519 --> 47:08.251
- Right.
- Okay, okay.

47:08.253 --> 47:10.488
But everything has to be
cleaned out by the morning.

47:10.490 --> 47:11.555
Everything.

47:11.557 --> 47:13.089
- Hey.
- You got me?

47:13.091 --> 47:14.324
Scout's honor.

47:14.326 --> 47:15.526
Whatever that shit is, right?

47:15.528 --> 47:17.461
- We give our word, right?
- Alright.

47:17.463 --> 47:18.395
Promise.

47:18.397 --> 47:20.129
We will be off first light.

47:20.131 --> 47:22.633
Alright, so, let's get
the party started, right?

47:22.635 --> 47:24.301
You girls, ready?

47:24.303 --> 47:25.136
Not yet.

47:26.405 --> 47:27.638
What do you mean?

47:27.640 --> 47:29.342
You have
to pay our boss.

47:30.476 --> 47:31.809
You brought your
boss out here?

47:31.811 --> 47:34.578
Why would, why would you
bring your boss out here?

47:34.580 --> 47:37.080
To make sure you guys
don't get too out of hand.

47:37.082 --> 47:39.118
To make sure you
pay before you play.

47:40.853 --> 47:42.620
Okay.

47:42.622 --> 47:44.622
Well, where is your boss?

47:44.624 --> 47:45.458
Back there.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.561
Alright.

47:49.562 --> 47:50.696
I'll go pay your boss.

47:52.698 --> 47:55.866
- Take care of him.
- So who's ready

47:55.868 --> 47:57.601
- for a good time?
- Well, hell yeah!

47:57.603 --> 47:58.536
Let's do it, man.

47:58.538 --> 48:00.371
Who's ready for a good time?

48:00.373 --> 48:03.173
Whoo!

48:03.175 --> 48:04.176
What's up, my man?

48:05.478 --> 48:07.480
My friends call me
Jinx, what's your name?

48:08.514 --> 48:09.348
Brick.

48:11.517 --> 48:14.487
Brick, is that cause you're
built like a shit brickhouse?

48:16.489 --> 48:17.323
Okay.

48:19.726 --> 48:21.325
Right.

48:21.327 --> 48:23.327
So is everything,
everything's good?

48:23.329 --> 48:24.663
We're good, we're good to go?

48:24.665 --> 48:25.732
You got the cash?

48:27.166 --> 48:29.701
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I got the cash.

48:29.703 --> 48:30.568
600 bucks, right?

48:30.570 --> 48:31.605
For two hours?

48:33.506 --> 48:35.874
I got, uh, a few, some
20s and fives in there,

48:35.876 --> 48:37.341
is that alright?

48:37.343 --> 48:40.146
But, man, I assure you,
all 600 bucks is there.

48:40.847 --> 48:42.482
You can count it if you like.

48:44.451 --> 48:47.485
Same rules apply out here
as they do at the club.

48:47.487 --> 48:50.256
Girls are topless
only, no touching.

48:51.925 --> 48:53.658
So.

48:53.660 --> 48:55.127
When you say no touching,

48:56.730 --> 48:58.463
that just means that we
can't touch the girls

48:58.465 --> 49:01.766
but, I mean, the girls can
touch us if they want to, right?

49:01.768 --> 49:04.502
If they really want to, yes.

49:04.504 --> 49:06.471
But that ain't
fittin' to happen.

49:06.473 --> 49:08.707
And don't be forcing
yourself on 'em either

49:08.709 --> 49:10.811
or you gonna have a
major fuckin' problem.

49:12.913 --> 49:14.412
Well, we don't any major

49:14.414 --> 49:16.681
fuckin' problems
with you, alright?

49:16.683 --> 49:19.718
We're just a cool group
of guys over there.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.853
Everything's gonna be
cool, I promise you.

49:21.855 --> 49:22.787
It's all good.

49:22.789 --> 49:23.624
No problems.

49:25.258 --> 49:27.292
Look, I'll be chillin'
over here from a distance

49:27.294 --> 49:29.427
but I could still see what's up.

49:29.429 --> 49:32.330
Don't make me go over there.

49:32.332 --> 49:33.531
Okay, bro.

49:33.533 --> 49:34.334
We're good!

49:36.670 --> 49:39.437
You got an hour
and 55 minutes left.

49:39.439 --> 49:41.706
Bring 'em back to this
spot and don't be late.

49:41.708 --> 49:45.945
If you do, I'ma charge
you another 600 dollars.

49:45.947 --> 49:48.446
Alright, well, we
will not be late.

49:48.448 --> 49:49.681
- I will see you then.
- Hey, Jinx.

49:49.683 --> 49:52.250
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Jinx, man, hey.

49:52.252 --> 49:53.652
Fuck, you're big!

49:53.654 --> 49:56.554
So I don't know if
you remember this,

49:56.556 --> 49:59.792
but you made a promise
to Caroline and me

49:59.794 --> 50:02.594
that there'd be no strippers.

50:02.596 --> 50:03.563
There's two of 'em.

50:04.464 --> 50:05.665
Yeah, that's right.

50:05.667 --> 50:07.298
You know why I
made that promise?

50:07.300 --> 50:09.669
Cause you wanted to bitch out
and leave earlier, remember?

50:09.671 --> 50:11.469
And if I told
Caroline the truth,

50:11.471 --> 50:12.537
you wouldn't be here right now.

50:12.539 --> 50:15.208
And also the bachelor
party's not for you, bro.

50:16.010 --> 50:17.943
They're for guys like me.

50:17.945 --> 50:21.346
Miserable bastards who hate
fucking being married, okay?

50:21.348 --> 50:22.815
And single dudes.

50:22.817 --> 50:24.717
So we're gonna go have
a good fuckin' time

50:24.719 --> 50:27.019
and if you don't wanna
have fun, man, that's okay.

50:27.021 --> 50:28.688
You can just sit
back and watch, okay?

50:28.690 --> 50:29.755
What's that
supposed to mean?

50:29.757 --> 50:30.956
Dude, I'm telling you.

50:30.958 --> 50:32.825
Once you fuckin' put
that ring on that finger

50:32.827 --> 50:34.026
your whole life's gonna change.

50:34.028 --> 50:35.961
All those good times
you're having right now,

50:35.963 --> 50:37.430
you can kiss that shit goodbye.

50:37.432 --> 50:38.397
You're gonna sit
here and tell me,

50:38.399 --> 50:40.866
oh, I'm so in love with Caroline

50:40.868 --> 50:43.369
and I can't cheat,
looking at titties

50:43.371 --> 50:45.538
and strippers is
cheating on her.

50:46.841 --> 50:48.574
You know what I don't
understand about you, Jinx?

50:48.576 --> 50:50.710
Is why you always gotta
be so fuckin' negative?

50:50.712 --> 50:52.445
- Yeah, why you...
- Look, Caroline and I,

50:52.447 --> 50:53.946
we love each other,
you've seen us together.

50:53.948 --> 50:57.316
We never argue and we
have plenty of sex.

50:57.318 --> 50:58.818
Yeah.

50:58.820 --> 50:59.785
The good
times are over, bro.

50:59.787 --> 51:01.454
What the fuck
are you talking about?

51:01.456 --> 51:03.956
I'm talkin' about
all that wild sex

51:03.958 --> 51:05.391
you're talkin'
about you have now

51:05.393 --> 51:07.560
and you're soulmates
and she sucks your cock

51:07.562 --> 51:09.428
and swallows and
all that, right?

51:09.430 --> 51:10.863
- Uh huh.
- Uh huh.

51:10.865 --> 51:13.532
Put the ring on her finger
and then talk to me.

51:13.534 --> 51:15.901
You're gonna be watching
that reality TV bullshit,

51:15.903 --> 51:18.471
- Housewives, fuckin'...
- Oh, we love that show.

51:18.473 --> 51:19.305
Of course, see?

51:19.307 --> 51:20.040
It's already started.

51:20.042 --> 51:21.674
How 'bout Vanderpump Rules, man?

51:21.676 --> 51:24.643
You know Vanderpump,
Vanderpump Rules, huh?

51:24.645 --> 51:26.847
Yeah, that's fucking
crazy, too, man.

51:26.849 --> 51:28.748
My life is fuckin' miserable!

51:28.750 --> 51:30.884
It fucking sucks!

51:30.886 --> 51:32.318
Okay?

51:32.320 --> 51:34.087
I just wanna see
some new titties.

51:34.089 --> 51:35.789
I just want 'em to,
like, poke their nipples

51:35.791 --> 51:37.690
around my face and
they might do it

51:37.692 --> 51:38.825
around my mouth cause
I remember that once.

51:38.827 --> 51:40.493
They kinda, mm, you know?

51:40.495 --> 51:41.862
Maybe something
like that'll happen.

51:41.864 --> 51:42.696
Look, I'm just gonna.

51:42.698 --> 51:43.864
Alright, let me
just say this, okay?

51:43.866 --> 51:45.331
It's just not a good idea, man.

51:45.333 --> 51:46.833
It's really not and I'm
gonna go on the record

51:46.835 --> 51:48.935
and I'm gonna say, this
isn't gonna end well.

51:48.937 --> 51:49.736
It's not.

51:49.738 --> 51:50.704
I'm tellin' you.

51:50.706 --> 51:52.038
It's gonna be just fine

51:52.040 --> 51:53.940
because you're gonna keep
your fuckin' mouth shut

51:53.942 --> 51:55.508
and have a good time.

51:55.510 --> 51:58.377
Okay, both of y'all sound
like two bitches right now.

51:58.379 --> 52:00.046
This one's pussy whipped.

52:00.048 --> 52:01.581
I'm not pussy whipped!

52:01.583 --> 52:02.783
Why does everybody
keep saying that to me?

52:02.785 --> 52:03.917
Because you're fucking
pussy whipped, man.

52:03.919 --> 52:05.417
Even he, he doesn't
even fucking know you

52:05.419 --> 52:06.653
and he knows you're
pussy whipped.

52:06.655 --> 52:07.788
You're pussy whipped.

52:07.790 --> 52:09.388
- Okay, here's the deal.
- Listen, dude.

52:09.390 --> 52:10.824
Hey, hey, hey,

52:10.826 --> 52:11.992
He said we had an
hour and 50 minutes,

52:11.994 --> 52:12.826
we've already spent what?

52:12.828 --> 52:14.494
Five, what time is it?

52:14.496 --> 52:15.796
Oh yeah, you got an
hour and 40 minutes left.

52:15.798 --> 52:17.063
Alright, that's
it, we're going.

52:17.065 --> 52:18.431
Go back to the fuckin' camp,

52:18.433 --> 52:19.699
- we're going.
- Just don't let.

52:19.701 --> 52:20.500
Hey, I don't want
'em dancin' on me.

52:20.502 --> 52:21.735
Brick, we're goin'.

52:21.737 --> 52:22.504
Brick, don't let
'em dance on me.

52:23.872 --> 52:26.842
So where is the lucky
bachelor for the night tonight?

52:28.377 --> 52:30.644
Okay, so, who's up first?

52:30.646 --> 52:33.580
Well, he should be first
cause he's the bachelor

52:33.582 --> 52:35.816
but he's pussy whipped

52:35.818 --> 52:37.851
and his woman doesn't
want him to have any fun

52:37.853 --> 52:39.853
at his bachelor party cause
he's not allowed to have one.

52:39.855 --> 52:41.421
So.

52:41.423 --> 52:43.157
I'm goin' first.

52:43.159 --> 52:45.159
Hey, why can't I go first?

52:45.161 --> 52:46.593
You're not goin', man.

52:46.595 --> 52:47.861
You wouldn't even
know what to do.

52:47.863 --> 52:49.696
Just chill out.

52:49.698 --> 52:51.498
Watch and learn.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.900
Let your uncle show you
how it's done, okay?

52:53.902 --> 52:55.637
No, I'm goin' first.

52:56.839 --> 52:58.139
What?

52:58.141 --> 52:59.739
You wanna go first?

53:00.542 --> 53:01.708
You hear that boys?

53:01.710 --> 53:02.977
Tell you what,

53:02.979 --> 53:05.982

you can dance on me.

53:09.853 --> 53:10.686
Bring it in.

54:29.799 --> 54:30.633
Oh, yes.

54:32.036 --> 54:33.168
Oh.

54:33.170 --> 54:37.973
Oh, motherfucker, I'm putting
this shit on the internet

54:37.975 --> 54:40.843
and then we'll see who's getting
married now, motherfucker.

54:42.212 --> 54:44.812
That's right, I'm
getting the last laugh.

54:44.814 --> 54:46.081
Oh, yeah.

54:46.083 --> 54:47.084
Grind it up.

54:48.018 --> 54:48.852
That's it.

54:49.954 --> 54:53.958
Fuck every branch on the
way down the breakup tree.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.524
Fuckin' hate spiders.

54:56.526 --> 54:57.161
The fuck?

54:58.762 --> 54:59.897
Got, shit.

55:01.564 --> 55:03.131
Oh, damn.

55:03.133 --> 55:04.933
Hey!

55:04.935 --> 55:06.670
Keep your hands to yourself!

55:08.072 --> 55:08.906
Shit.

55:10.074 --> 55:11.974
Damn, I swear they
act like they ain't

55:11.976 --> 55:13.243
never seen no pussy before.

55:14.611 --> 55:16.812
Look at that, it don't
make no damn sense.

55:16.814 --> 55:20.015
I swear on my life,
what the fuck?

55:29.994 --> 55:32.127
Okay, she's like
getting loose.

55:32.129 --> 55:33.161
Get it!

55:33.163 --> 55:34.863
I wish that was me.

55:34.865 --> 55:36.198
Yes, look at her go.

55:36.200 --> 55:38.334
Oh my God.

55:38.336 --> 55:40.769
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, I cannot believe

55:40.771 --> 55:42.170
she just put her hand there.

55:45.676 --> 55:46.908
Knock, knock.

55:46.910 --> 55:48.210
Are you ready for my cock?

55:48.212 --> 55:49.845
Yeah!

55:49.847 --> 55:50.748
Yeah, I am.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.182
Oh my God, I can't believe

55:53.184 --> 55:55.617
she's getting
married in one week.

55:55.619 --> 55:57.119
Me either.

55:57.121 --> 55:57.986
I don't know how she's gonna
give up girls' night out.

55:57.988 --> 56:00.055
I don't think
she will, I mean,

56:00.057 --> 56:01.857
seriously I don't think
she's gonna give it up

56:01.859 --> 56:03.359
just because she's
getting married.

56:03.361 --> 56:05.328
Oh my God, y'all,
look at Caroline's page.

56:05.330 --> 56:07.029
What is it?

56:07.031 --> 56:08.131
It's Pat dancing with two
naked chicks in the woods.

56:08.133 --> 56:10.832
Oh shit, she's
gonna freak the fuck out!

56:10.834 --> 56:13.169
I know, she doesn't
even allow him to drink.

56:13.171 --> 56:14.370
Should we tell her?

56:14.372 --> 56:16.072
No, no, no, no.

56:16.074 --> 56:18.542
She'll flip the fuck out
and ruin the night, don't.

56:21.079 --> 56:24.149
Ten thousand views
in five minutes?

56:29.287 --> 56:31.154
Caroline, where are you going?

56:31.156 --> 56:33.089
Watch where the
fuck you're goin'.

56:33.091 --> 56:35.724
Fuck you, you don't
wanna fuck with me tonight.

56:35.726 --> 56:36.893
- Break it up, break it up.
- Really?

56:36.895 --> 56:38.261
You better take your ass off.

56:38.263 --> 56:40.331
Yeah, good idea,
you fucking cunt.

56:44.969 --> 56:46.135
- Should we go get her?
- No, no, no, leave it.

56:46.137 --> 56:47.403
Leave it.

56:56.081 --> 56:58.414
Get it, get it!

56:58.416 --> 57:00.249
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

57:00.251 --> 57:01.953
Have a great night!

58:38.250 --> 58:39.084
Yeah!

58:42.454 --> 58:43.987
Yeah!

58:43.989 --> 58:45.222
Quiet!

58:45.224 --> 58:46.356
Shut up!

58:46.358 --> 58:47.525
Quiet!

58:47.527 --> 58:48.526
Everybody, cool, cool.

58:48.528 --> 58:49.993
- What's up?
- Shh.

58:49.995 --> 58:51.795
Officer
Bates, where are you?

58:51.797 --> 58:53.197
Officer Bates.

58:53.199 --> 58:54.532
How's everything
going at Cherokee Creek?

58:54.534 --> 58:56.099
You never checked in.

58:56.101 --> 58:57.901
Oh, that was
just a false alarm.

58:57.903 --> 58:59.337
Everything looks
good, it's all fine.

58:59.339 --> 59:00.538
I checked out the north side,

59:00.540 --> 59:01.905
I'm gonna go check
out the east side now.

59:01.907 --> 59:03.073
Sounds
good, ten-four.

59:03.075 --> 59:03.909
Ten-four.

59:05.978 --> 59:07.211
- Alright.
- Alright!

59:07.213 --> 59:10.113
Everybody, clean
up this crap, okay?

59:10.115 --> 59:11.349
All of it!

59:11.351 --> 59:13.284
Or I'm gonna find
you in the morning.

59:13.286 --> 59:14.117
- Hey.
- Everything.

59:14.119 --> 59:16.019
We're good, we're
good, we're good.

59:16.021 --> 59:18.789
I'm talking the plates, the
cups, everything else, okay?

59:18.791 --> 59:19.957
There's beer everywhere.

59:19.959 --> 59:20.857
We don't need a fire.

59:20.859 --> 59:21.494
Give me my hat.

59:22.429 --> 59:24.229
Alright, we will
clean it up right now.

59:24.231 --> 59:25.396
Thank you, thank you so much.

59:25.398 --> 59:28.132
Jarrett, pick up all this
shit and throw it in the tent.

59:28.134 --> 59:29.267
Okay.

59:29.269 --> 59:31.536
Get that for me,
man, I gotta take a leak.

59:31.538 --> 59:35.306
I saw these titty
bitches all over you

59:35.308 --> 59:37.275
in the woods and you promised me

59:37.277 --> 59:39.043
there wouldn't be
strippers and now

59:39.045 --> 59:41.512
you're not picking up
your phone, I wonder why.

59:41.514 --> 59:43.314
I wonder why, Pat.

59:43.316 --> 59:45.283
I am going to keep calling you

59:45.285 --> 59:47.919
until I find you in
those fucking woods

59:47.921 --> 59:49.454
and I'm going to sit you down.

59:49.456 --> 59:50.789
Roll the window down.

59:52.492 --> 59:53.958
Have one hell of a talk

59:53.960 --> 59:56.861
because right now I am
questioning everything.

59:56.863 --> 59:58.296
Everything, Pat.

59:58.298 --> 01:00:01.332
Call me back.

01:00:01.334 --> 01:00:02.267
What?

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:04.235
You owe me for two
dances and three drinks.

01:00:04.237 --> 01:00:05.169
What are you talking about?

01:00:05.171 --> 01:00:06.537
No, it's my bachelorette party.

01:00:06.539 --> 01:00:08.239
My friends are in
there, they've got me,

01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:09.240
go talk to them.

01:00:09.242 --> 01:00:11.309
Listen, there's no way
you're getting married.

01:00:11.311 --> 01:00:13.144
No dude would marry some chick

01:00:13.146 --> 01:00:14.279
that's hanging out at a dick bar

01:00:14.281 --> 01:00:17.282
every weekend with a life
filled with such debauchery.

01:00:17.284 --> 01:00:18.584
There's no bachelorette party,

01:00:18.586 --> 01:00:20.051
you don't have any friends,

01:00:20.053 --> 01:00:21.386
you're going home
to feed your cats.

01:00:21.388 --> 01:00:23.087
What?

01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:24.289
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:27.258
I don't owe you
shit, okay, dimwit?

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.926
Listen, there's no
need to be a bitch.

01:00:28.928 --> 01:00:33.031
I need you to pay for
two dances, three drinks.

01:00:33.033 --> 01:00:34.299
I see you in here every weekend

01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:36.100
spending money on them
dicks like it's crack.

01:00:36.102 --> 01:00:38.069
So I need you to go ahead
and crack open that purse

01:00:38.071 --> 01:00:40.406
and pay for the two dances
and three drinks that you got.

01:00:40.408 --> 01:00:42.641
Okay, fine, don't be such
a fucking dick about it.

01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:44.345
Jesus Christ.

01:00:46.247 --> 01:00:49.517
Two dances, three
drinks, pay up.

01:01:07.635 --> 01:01:08.469
Oh!

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:17.076
Little chickee, eat a banana.

01:01:17.078 --> 01:01:19.078
And I'll show you a big daddy.

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.112
That's right.

01:01:22.516 --> 01:01:25.384
You gonna get a
workout tonight, Bubba.

01:01:25.386 --> 01:01:27.086
That's right.

01:01:27.088 --> 01:01:27.922
Big time.

01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:31.926
Ooh, that bitch is hot.

01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:33.627
Mmhmm.

01:01:34.528 --> 01:01:35.529
What the fuck?

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:37.696
Hey, man.

01:01:37.698 --> 01:01:39.998
You must be the producer
that Jinx told me about.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.467
Drew?

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:44.605
Oh yeah, you must be
the aspiring actor, Dusty.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.573
How tall are you?

01:01:47.575 --> 01:01:49.508
How tall do you want me to be?

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:53.345
Well, the job posting said
you had to be at least 6'5

01:01:53.347 --> 01:01:56.515
or taller, you look
like you're barely 5'11.

01:01:56.517 --> 01:01:58.417
Well, hey man,
don't worry about it

01:01:58.419 --> 01:02:00.386
because between you and
me, I have some KISS boots

01:02:00.388 --> 01:02:03.389
back in my car that
are ready to strap on.

01:02:03.391 --> 01:02:05.057
Well, we got bigger problems.

01:02:05.059 --> 01:02:07.328
What the fuck are you wearing?

01:02:08.697 --> 01:02:11.466
What happened to the costume
we gave you at the studio?

01:02:13.402 --> 01:02:15.535
This looks like some
cheap piece of shit

01:02:15.537 --> 01:02:19.706
you'd get at a local retail
outlet for a Halloween party.

01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:21.408
Well, here's the thing, man.

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:22.542
That suit that you guys gave me

01:02:22.544 --> 01:02:26.413
was so fucking hot and it
smelled like absolute shit

01:02:26.415 --> 01:02:28.180
whenever I got into it, man.

01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:30.283
I picked this up for
50 dollars at the store

01:02:30.285 --> 01:02:33.188
and it works just as good
and it looks fucking cool.

01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:36.691
Please tell me you know
what method acting is.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.759
Well, here's the thing,

01:02:39.761 --> 01:02:43.061
I haven't been
doing this that long

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.664
but I'm a really quick learner

01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:47.032
and as long as you tell me
what to do, I can do it.

01:02:47.034 --> 01:02:48.601
I watch a lot of movies

01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:51.037
and it really can't be
that hard to pick up.

01:02:51.039 --> 01:02:54.274
Oh, we are so fucked.

01:02:54.276 --> 01:02:55.577
Alright, listen.

01:02:56.778 --> 01:03:01.047
Method acting is committing
to the part 100 percent, okay?

01:03:01.049 --> 01:03:02.682
You don't even know
where you begin

01:03:02.684 --> 01:03:04.617
- and the character ends.
- Yeah.

01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:08.123
Basically, you cease
to exist as a person.

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:13.092
Now listen to me, I
want you to be Bigfoot.

01:03:13.094 --> 01:03:16.563
Alright, so go and
be Bigfoot, alright?

01:03:16.565 --> 01:03:20.768
Get your KISS boots, put 'em
on and put on the costume

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:24.304
that we gave you
originally to wear.

01:03:24.306 --> 01:03:26.072
Okay, yeah, I
think I can do that.

01:03:26.074 --> 01:03:27.607
No, don't think
you could do it.

01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:30.276
You either do it
or you don't do it.

01:03:30.278 --> 01:03:31.511
Okay, man, I can do it.

01:03:31.513 --> 01:03:33.681
I just, just relax a little bit.

01:03:33.683 --> 01:03:36.516
I want a hundred
percent method.

01:03:36.518 --> 01:03:38.218
Get in there and fucking growl,

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:39.687
fucking thrash shit
around, alright?

01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:42.590
Bigfoot's not a pussy, so
quit acting like a pussy.

01:03:42.592 --> 01:03:44.457
- No more pussy talk!
- So don't be a pussy.

01:03:44.459 --> 01:03:45.626
I won't!

01:03:45.628 --> 01:03:49.062
Oh my God, I cannot believe
Vinny Blades is out here.

01:03:49.064 --> 01:03:52.600
I've seen all his movies and
his music is badass, too.

01:03:52.602 --> 01:03:53.400
I know.

01:03:53.402 --> 01:03:54.602
I love 80s rock.

01:03:54.604 --> 01:03:57.103
Maybe later we can
double team him.

01:03:57.105 --> 01:03:58.339
I'm all for that.

01:03:58.341 --> 01:04:00.774
I mean, shit, and
those eyes, oh my God.

01:04:00.776 --> 01:04:01.742
I know.

01:04:01.744 --> 01:04:03.644
All his friends are such dorks.

01:04:03.646 --> 01:04:06.079
How do you think
they know him?

01:04:06.081 --> 01:04:07.548
They probably work
for him or something.

01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:09.252
Part of his entourage.

01:04:10.586 --> 01:04:12.085
I don't think he could
actually be friends with them.

01:04:12.087 --> 01:04:12.720
Me either.

01:04:13.556 --> 01:04:14.555
Oh my God.

01:04:18.427 --> 01:04:19.729
Please tell me that was you.

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:22.696
What do you mean?

01:04:22.698 --> 01:04:25.766
Please, tell me you put
a bloody hand out there

01:04:25.768 --> 01:04:26.702
for them to find.

01:04:27.703 --> 01:04:29.837
Uh, oh, oh yeah.

01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:31.505
No, no, no, that was me.

01:04:31.507 --> 01:04:34.308
I put a bloody hand and
some other stuff out there.

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:35.609
No, yeah, that was all me.

01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:36.844
Okay, okay.

01:04:36.846 --> 01:04:38.679
And you took care
of the vehicles?

01:04:38.681 --> 01:04:40.447
And the cell phones?

01:04:40.449 --> 01:04:43.684
Well, the vehicles, yes,
but the cell phones, no.

01:04:43.686 --> 01:04:45.653
Oh, fuck, alright, look.

01:04:45.655 --> 01:04:46.754
Gonna have to haul
ass in the camp

01:04:46.756 --> 01:04:48.188
while they're all
out checking out

01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:49.657
what the girls are
freaking out about.

01:04:49.659 --> 01:04:51.725
Alright, all the cell
phones they're in

01:04:51.727 --> 01:04:53.727
the tent Chad's in, alright?

01:04:53.729 --> 01:04:56.330
And don't fuck this up if you
wanna be in one of my movies.

01:04:56.332 --> 01:04:57.464
You got it, I won't.

01:04:57.466 --> 01:04:58.767
- No, no, no, I got it.
- Go now.

01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:00.735
Get the fuck outta here, Chaka.

01:05:00.737 --> 01:05:02.236
Yeah, I got it, man!

01:05:02.238 --> 01:05:04.471
I won't let you down, sir!

01:05:04.473 --> 01:05:05.308
Fuck.

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.142
Hey!

01:05:08.144 --> 01:05:10.177
What's goin' on?

01:05:10.179 --> 01:05:11.613
I, I don't know,
there's like something

01:05:11.615 --> 01:05:13.615
over here that's
dead, I don't know.

01:05:13.617 --> 01:05:15.416
Shit, is that a bloody skull?

01:05:15.418 --> 01:05:16.818
A bloody foot?

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.254
And some, something or
someone must've killed it.

01:05:20.256 --> 01:05:21.690
Why didn't you call me
to come and protect you?

01:05:21.692 --> 01:05:22.724
I could've done that.

01:05:22.726 --> 01:05:23.760
What the hell is that?

01:05:24.828 --> 01:05:27.394
Did some sort of animal attack?

01:05:27.396 --> 01:05:28.430
Well, it could
be, I mean shit.

01:05:28.432 --> 01:05:30.297
They've had a lot of
Bigfoot sightings out here,

01:05:30.299 --> 01:05:31.666
that's why we brought Pat
here in the first place.

01:05:31.668 --> 01:05:33.167
Whoa, you think
there's a Bigfoot

01:05:33.169 --> 01:05:34.869
running around here
killing people?

01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:36.270
Well, yeah, why wouldn't it?

01:05:36.272 --> 01:05:38.506
No, no, no, you
guys Bigfoot wouldn't,

01:05:38.508 --> 01:05:39.741
Bigfoot wouldn't hurt
anybody, you know,

01:05:39.743 --> 01:05:43.878
unless you're fuckin'
with his territory.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.715
Or him.

01:05:45.782 --> 01:05:46.648
You know?

01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:48.883
Come on, you know,
you know the rules.

01:05:48.885 --> 01:05:49.884
I told y'all.

01:05:49.886 --> 01:05:51.586
- Rules?
- I don't know.

01:05:51.588 --> 01:05:52.754
I ain't never heard of
no fucking Bigfoot rules.

01:05:52.756 --> 01:05:53.688
Did you guys?

01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:55.290
I don't know what
the fucking rules are.

01:05:55.292 --> 01:05:56.858
Did you tell me some rules?

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.193
Dude, I ain't never
heard no fucking rules.

01:05:58.195 --> 01:05:59.327
Guys!

01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.928
What?

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.329
Rules!

01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:02.430
Alright, fine,
what are the rules?

01:06:02.432 --> 01:06:07.204
You don't piss or shit
or fornicate in his area.

01:06:07.804 --> 01:06:08.205
His territory.

01:06:09.706 --> 01:06:10.538
What, out here?

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:11.740
Yeah.

01:06:11.742 --> 01:06:12.841
Cause it's just
disrespectful, man.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:17.746
Like, he's an animal just
like all the other animals.

01:06:17.748 --> 01:06:18.580
What?

01:06:18.582 --> 01:06:20.717
Yeah, he's just
bigger and scarier.

01:06:21.919 --> 01:06:23.251
That's all people do is piss

01:06:23.253 --> 01:06:24.486
and shit and fornicate
in the woods.

01:06:24.488 --> 01:06:26.989
Um, okay, so I just
pissed in the woods,

01:06:26.991 --> 01:06:28.723
is he gonna come kill me now?

01:06:28.725 --> 01:06:30.928
- Yeah, so did I.
- Uh.

01:06:33.597 --> 01:06:35.263
Yeah, what's the
rules with the women?

01:06:35.265 --> 01:06:36.766
I don't know, I
mean they're female so

01:06:36.768 --> 01:06:39.969
you might be alright but
I'm not a hundred percent.

01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:43.638
You don't really believe
in Bigfoot, do you?

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:46.307
It had to have been
another human, a bear,

01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:49.310
some other animal, I don't
believe that nonsense.

01:06:49.312 --> 01:06:50.846
Um, I'm sure
you're right, Bambi.

01:06:50.848 --> 01:06:53.816
I mean, after all we do
have these, you know,

01:06:53.818 --> 01:06:55.885
handsome strong men
to come protect us.

01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:57.620
Well, of course.

01:06:57.622 --> 01:06:58.654
That's right.

01:06:58.656 --> 01:07:00.823
I would never let anything
happen to you girls.

01:07:00.825 --> 01:07:02.225
Not as long as I'm here.

01:07:05.463 --> 01:07:06.464
Hey, Bambi.

01:07:07.865 --> 01:07:10.298
Thanks for making this
the best night of my life.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.502
Could I maybe get your
e-mail or your phone number?

01:07:13.504 --> 01:07:14.737
Maybe your Instagram handle?

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:16.639
You're so sweet.

01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:19.341
You can look me up on
Facebook and add me

01:07:19.343 --> 01:07:21.844
and after we're friends,
you can see when I'm working

01:07:21.846 --> 01:07:23.779
and come get some
dances at the club.

01:07:23.781 --> 01:07:24.947
Awesome!

01:07:24.949 --> 01:07:28.384
That sounds great,
yeah, I'll see you soon.

01:07:28.386 --> 01:07:29.552
Okay.

01:07:29.554 --> 01:07:30.986
Get back over here, man.

01:07:30.988 --> 01:07:32.688
Alright.

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:34.657
Yeah, yeah, go to the club
and spend all your money.

01:07:34.659 --> 01:07:35.858
Smart man.

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.894
Good job.

01:07:39.063 --> 01:07:40.062
What the hell, man, you alright?

01:07:40.064 --> 01:07:41.831
- You alright?
- You okay?

01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:44.533
What the fuck, man?

01:07:44.535 --> 01:07:45.367
That hit me!

01:07:45.369 --> 01:07:46.302
Oh.

01:07:46.304 --> 01:07:47.369
Oh, dude, dude, you okay?

01:07:47.371 --> 01:07:48.304
What the fuck?

01:07:48.306 --> 01:07:49.772
What the fuck's going on?

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:50.639
I, I don't think, I don't
think I feel very good.

01:07:50.641 --> 01:07:51.774
Think it hit me
in the eye, dude.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:52.908
Thanks.

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:54.010
You smell like shit, man.

01:07:54.012 --> 01:07:55.778
Hey, you know what, guys?

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.080
I think we need to
get him back to camp.

01:07:57.082 --> 01:07:58.814
Yeah, I can't
party with you guys.

01:07:58.816 --> 01:07:59.815
Get him outta here, man.

01:07:59.817 --> 01:08:02.618
Alright, guys, I think
I was drugged, you know?

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.020
Hey, uh, me and Vinny
are gonna take care

01:08:04.022 --> 01:08:05.554
of the girls, we'll
get 'em back to Brick.

01:08:05.556 --> 01:08:06.822
- Bye, girls.
- What?

01:08:06.824 --> 01:08:08.357
We'll catch up with
y'all later, alright?

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:25.443
Fucking party with
fuckin' harlots without me?

01:08:29.346 --> 01:08:31.984
I'm pissing in the
fucking cooler.

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:38.924
Okay.

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:40.859
Oh.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.594
Ah, yeah.

01:08:51.636 --> 01:08:54.037
Wait, that's my
tent, that's my tent.

01:08:56.475 --> 01:08:57.975
Taste the rainbow.

01:08:58.944 --> 01:09:00.877
I get the best seat in town.

01:09:00.879 --> 01:09:02.078
Ooh.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.513
Hey!

01:09:03.515 --> 01:09:05.417
Fucking watch out, you
almost hit my dick!

01:09:09.955 --> 01:09:11.890
Ah, guys, fuckin' stop.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:16.929
Ah, fucking dickhead.

01:09:17.895 --> 01:09:20.063
Fucking shit, fucking cut it,

01:09:20.064 --> 01:09:21.800
ah, fuck you!

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:24.033
Ow!

01:09:24.036 --> 01:09:25.635
You fuckin' asshole.

01:09:25.636 --> 01:09:27.002
Ow!

01:09:27.005 --> 01:09:28.171
Ah!

01:09:28.174 --> 01:09:29.840
Ow!

01:09:35.747 --> 01:09:36.814
Stop, guys!

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.551
Guys, fucking stop!

01:09:42.055 --> 01:09:46.924
Stop, okay, I'm sorry I
peed on the camp, okay?

01:09:46.926 --> 01:09:49.126
Just fucking cut it out.

01:09:50.897 --> 01:09:51.996
Who's fucking doing that?

01:09:51.997 --> 01:09:53.630
Stop that shit.

01:09:53.631 --> 01:09:54.832
That fucking.

01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:58.938
Fucking God, please.

01:10:01.875 --> 01:10:03.040
I don't, thou.

01:10:03.042 --> 01:10:05.745
Thou art the father in Heaven,

01:10:07.046 --> 01:10:10.884
in Heaven, come unto
glory for fucking, think,

01:10:12.752 --> 01:10:13.918
and break the trespassers.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.452
What the fuck?

01:10:15.454 --> 01:10:16.187
Oh my fucking God.

01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:17.655
Oh, straight to voicemail?

01:10:17.657 --> 01:10:19.156
You turned your phone off?

01:10:19.158 --> 01:10:20.992
Motherfucker, I'm
gonna embarrass you

01:10:20.994 --> 01:10:22.159
in front of all of your friends,

01:10:22.161 --> 01:10:23.527
how does that sound?

01:10:23.529 --> 01:10:24.461
Yeah, that's right,
motherfucker.

01:10:24.463 --> 01:10:26.931
I put a tracker on your phone.

01:10:34.207 --> 01:10:35.907
Fuck, stop, fuck, I'm awake.

01:10:35.909 --> 01:10:37.875
You fucking noise, fuck!

01:10:41.614 --> 01:10:43.014
Shit.

01:10:56.263 --> 01:10:57.495
Shit.

01:10:57.497 --> 01:10:59.532
Shit every fucking where.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:00.998
Shit.

01:11:09.276 --> 01:11:10.110
Shit.

01:11:13.213 --> 01:11:14.980
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Uh oh.

01:11:14.982 --> 01:11:16.681
- Oh, he's gonna blow.
- Oh, oh, oh.

01:11:16.683 --> 01:11:17.983
Ooh!

01:11:17.985 --> 01:11:18.749
- Aww.
- Dude.

01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:21.086
Oh, I'm not
lookin' over there.

01:11:21.088 --> 01:11:22.120
I'm okay.

01:11:22.122 --> 01:11:24.522
Hey, where is it?

01:11:24.524 --> 01:11:25.991
- Where's my phone?
- Okay, it's over here.

01:11:25.993 --> 01:11:26.925
- Find my phone.
- We'll get it.

01:11:26.927 --> 01:11:29.094
- Okay, okay, alright.
- Watch your step.

01:11:29.096 --> 01:11:30.295
Oh, log, log, log.

01:11:30.297 --> 01:11:31.263
There's a log there,
there's a log.

01:11:31.265 --> 01:11:33.564
Okay, log, log, yep.

01:11:33.566 --> 01:11:35.599
- Is it in here?
- Yeah, can you get in there?

01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:38.072
Oh, easy, easy, easy!

01:11:39.974 --> 01:11:41.039
You can

01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:42.242
check that out, I'm not.

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:44.144
He's okay.

01:11:45.145 --> 01:11:46.945
Hey.

01:11:46.947 --> 01:11:47.813
- He's okay.
- Okay.

01:11:47.815 --> 01:11:50.015
Hey, listen, speaking
of cell phones,

01:11:50.017 --> 01:11:51.883
my portable cell phone charger,

01:11:51.885 --> 01:11:53.285
I left it in the car.

01:11:53.287 --> 01:11:54.219
I'ma have to go get it, man.

01:11:54.221 --> 01:11:55.187
- What?
- Yeah.

01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:56.888
I can't be without a cellphone.

01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:59.624
Hey, you take care of him,
I'll be back in a few.

01:11:59.626 --> 01:12:00.859
- You got this.
- What?

01:12:00.861 --> 01:12:02.563
No, you can't leave me with him!

01:12:03.731 --> 01:12:05.864
- Jarrett!
- Hey.

01:12:05.866 --> 01:12:07.933
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, there's a lantern.

01:12:07.935 --> 01:12:11.005
- There you go.
- I have to call Caroline.

01:12:15.009 --> 01:12:17.075
- Hey, Pat!
- What?

01:12:17.077 --> 01:12:18.310
Uh, Chad's gone.

01:12:18.312 --> 01:12:19.947
Who gives a shit?

01:12:21.081 --> 01:12:24.182
I should've knocked
him out years ago

01:12:24.184 --> 01:12:26.718
for his shit mouth tying.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.788
Go get my phone!

01:12:29.089 --> 01:12:30.657
I gotta call Caroline.

01:12:34.762 --> 01:12:37.095
- Uh, Pat?
- Huh?

01:12:37.097 --> 01:12:39.698
Uh, phone is broke
into a bunch of pieces.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:41.800
What do you mean
broke into pieces?

01:12:41.802 --> 01:12:44.370
I guess when Chad woke
up from being knocked out,

01:12:44.372 --> 01:12:47.639
he got really pissed and
smashed up our phones

01:12:47.641 --> 01:12:48.907
and then he left.

01:12:48.909 --> 01:12:50.176
You know it sounds
just like something

01:12:50.178 --> 01:12:52.844
that asshole would
do, you know that?

01:12:52.846 --> 01:12:54.113
Oh, I'm fucked up.

01:12:54.115 --> 01:12:55.181
I'm pretty, I'm
fading fast, man.

01:12:55.183 --> 01:12:56.615
I can't.

01:12:56.617 --> 01:12:57.783
I can't deal with
this right now, okay?

01:12:57.785 --> 01:12:59.651
I'll find him in the morning.

01:12:59.653 --> 01:13:00.886
I'll give him a sandwich.

01:13:00.888 --> 01:13:02.123
I'll give him a
knuckle sandwich.

01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:06.359
What am I supposed to do?

01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:08.161
Shut up and go to sleep.

01:13:08.163 --> 01:13:09.761
I can't go to sleep!

01:13:09.763 --> 01:13:12.298
I slept for 16 hours straight
for this badass party,

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.700
I wanna get some action!

01:13:14.869 --> 01:13:16.335
Plus I need somebody
cool to hang out with.

01:13:16.337 --> 01:13:19.405
Oh my God, just stop talking.

01:13:19.407 --> 01:13:21.841
Leave me alone, go
sleep in Chad's tent.

01:13:21.843 --> 01:13:22.875
Go!

01:13:22.877 --> 01:13:23.745
Now fuck off!

01:13:26.948 --> 01:13:27.782
Hey, Pat.

01:13:29.184 --> 01:13:30.718
You're a real dick.

01:13:44.766 --> 01:13:45.998
Shit, fucking fuck,
fuck, shit, shit.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.233
Fucking fuck.

01:13:47.235 --> 01:13:48.401
Fuck, fuck, fuck, oh
shit, fucking please.

01:13:48.403 --> 01:13:51.037
Fuck, fuck, please, please.

01:13:59.448 --> 01:14:00.215
Holy shit.

01:14:01.716 --> 01:14:02.882
Pat was right.

01:14:20.768 --> 01:14:22.101
Ooh, I gotta take a shit.

01:14:22.103 --> 01:14:23.403
Ooh.

01:14:24.806 --> 01:14:27.174
Mm, oh shouldn't have
had that hot dog.

01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:30.079
Oh, God.

01:14:35.284 --> 01:14:36.118
Shit.

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:45.325
Oh.

01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:52.134
Ooh, that is rancid.

01:14:56.939 --> 01:14:57.773
Dusty?

01:14:58.874 --> 01:15:01.975
Is that you?

01:15:03.846 --> 01:15:05.746
Oh, how am I gonna wipe this up?

01:15:05.748 --> 01:15:07.014
Oh.

01:15:07.016 --> 01:15:08.184
Some leaves, leaves.

01:15:11.187 --> 01:15:12.386
Oh, that's not gonna work.

01:15:12.388 --> 01:15:15.255
Oh, shit, I gotta get the sock.

01:15:15.257 --> 01:15:16.456
Gotta get a sock.

01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:18.093
Take off my sock.

01:15:19.028 --> 01:15:20.460
Oh, shit.

01:15:20.462 --> 01:15:21.297
Oh.

01:15:28.771 --> 01:15:29.405
Oh, yeah.

01:15:33.342 --> 01:15:34.176
Mmm.

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:37.811
Oh, good lord.

01:15:37.813 --> 01:15:39.215
Oh, that stinks.

01:15:42.352 --> 01:15:44.321
Oh, yeah, that's
gonna clean up nice.

01:15:46.188 --> 01:15:47.821
What the fuck?

01:15:47.823 --> 01:15:49.424
God damn it.

01:15:49.426 --> 01:15:50.258
Fuck!

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.158
I'm, shit!

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.394
Fucking shit everywhere!

01:15:53.396 --> 01:15:54.397
God damn it!

01:15:55.332 --> 01:15:56.366
Fuck it.

01:15:58.568 --> 01:16:01.204
I'll shower it off
when I get home.

01:16:25.195 --> 01:16:27.828
What the fuck is that?

01:16:32.535 --> 01:16:33.370
Uncle?

01:16:35.438 --> 01:16:40.443
Vinny?

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:41.344
Dusty?

01:16:42.379 --> 01:16:44.114
Dude, is that you?

01:16:48.451 --> 01:16:50.385
Now that's the fucking Bigfoot

01:16:50.387 --> 01:16:52.887
costume you're supposed to wear.

01:16:52.889 --> 01:16:54.355
Yes!

01:16:54.357 --> 01:16:56.026
Hey, let's hug it out, bitch.

01:16:58.361 --> 01:16:59.195
Oh!

01:17:00.196 --> 01:17:02.363
Jesus, you're strong!

01:17:02.365 --> 01:17:03.532
Hey, man, I can't breathe.

01:17:03.534 --> 01:17:07.001
Motherfucker, I can't breathe!

01:17:07.003 --> 01:17:08.169
You win!

01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:09.571
No more, man, no more, man.

01:17:18.349 --> 01:17:19.881
This is the spot
that that dude, Brick,

01:17:19.883 --> 01:17:21.082
told me to meet him at.

01:17:21.084 --> 01:17:22.016
He said if the
girls weren't here

01:17:22.018 --> 01:17:23.251
at this exact fucking moment,

01:17:23.253 --> 01:17:25.255
he was gonna charge
me an extra 600 bucks.

01:17:26.524 --> 01:17:28.056
I don't know, it went
straight to voicemail.

01:17:28.058 --> 01:17:30.392
Hey, man, look, relax,
we got here early.

01:17:30.394 --> 01:17:31.327
Right?

01:17:31.329 --> 01:17:33.295
So let's just enjoy the night.

01:17:33.297 --> 01:17:34.463
Okay?

01:17:34.465 --> 01:17:35.397
Maybe he's out
there taking a shit.

01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:36.198
I think he's trying to gip me.

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.366
He's trying to
fucking rip me off.

01:17:37.368 --> 01:17:38.300
So what do you do?

01:17:38.302 --> 01:17:39.368
He decides he's gonna disappear

01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:41.570
and then charge me because
I can't find his ass.

01:17:41.572 --> 01:17:43.439
I think it's gonna be alright.

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:44.673
Okay?

01:17:44.675 --> 01:17:45.940
Let's just go out
and enjoy our night.

01:17:45.942 --> 01:17:47.142
Let's go for a walk.

01:17:47.144 --> 01:17:48.577
So how do you guys
know each other?

01:17:48.579 --> 01:17:51.280
You talking about me
and Pat or me and Vinny?

01:17:51.282 --> 01:17:52.514
You and Vinny.

01:17:52.516 --> 01:17:54.149
Like, I mean, I know
Vinny, he's a celebrity,

01:17:54.151 --> 01:17:55.084
but like where do you?

01:17:55.086 --> 01:17:57.586
Where do you fit into all this?

01:17:57.588 --> 01:17:59.021
What?

01:17:59.023 --> 01:18:00.189
Are you fucking
serious right now?

01:18:00.191 --> 01:18:01.423
You're fucking kidding
with me, right?

01:18:01.425 --> 01:18:02.257
I've seen all
of Vinny's movies

01:18:02.259 --> 01:18:03.459
and I've never seen you.

01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:05.327
- Really?
- Mm mm.

01:18:05.329 --> 01:18:07.463
You're full of shit because
if you know how to read

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:10.432
fucking credits, where
it says produced by,

01:18:10.434 --> 01:18:11.600
it says produced by me.

01:18:11.602 --> 01:18:14.636
And also it has my name as
one of the co-leads with him.

01:18:14.638 --> 01:18:17.039
I saved his ass on that
fucking Switchblade movie.

01:18:17.041 --> 01:18:19.174
That's why he changed his
fucking name to Vinny Blades

01:18:19.176 --> 01:18:21.076
and he has a whole
fucking franchise.

01:18:21.078 --> 01:18:22.111
Because of me.

01:18:22.113 --> 01:18:23.345
Fuck you!

01:18:23.347 --> 01:18:25.547
How dare you make
me drive all the way

01:18:25.549 --> 01:18:27.316
to the woods in the
middle of the night

01:18:27.318 --> 01:18:30.285
when all I wanted was
just one simple night

01:18:30.287 --> 01:18:32.287
out with the girls
before I get married?

01:18:32.289 --> 01:18:34.258
That's literally all
I wanted, but no.

01:18:35.459 --> 01:18:37.560
You had to post this
fucking video online

01:18:37.562 --> 01:18:39.228
with these, these, these,
these, these fucking

01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:43.265
like titty out, fucking
witch women, bitches, cunts,

01:18:43.267 --> 01:18:46.068
whatever the fuck
they are all over you.

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:49.439
So now I've gotta come
sort that shit out.

01:18:49.441 --> 01:18:51.541
You spread your
fucking seed too much.

01:18:51.543 --> 01:18:53.443
You're with a fucking
different girl every night.

01:18:53.445 --> 01:18:55.612
Dude, just, you know
what you should do?

01:18:55.614 --> 01:18:57.146
You should take a
little responsibility

01:18:57.148 --> 01:18:59.549
and wrap that motherfucker
up every once in awhile.

01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:01.384
That's not rock n' roll.

01:19:01.386 --> 01:19:04.421
I like to feel skin on skin.

01:19:04.423 --> 01:19:05.588
Condoms suck.

01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:07.022
You don't feel shit.

01:19:07.024 --> 01:19:08.525
Those chicks thought
you wearing a condom

01:19:08.527 --> 01:19:09.692
and you just fucking took it off

01:19:09.694 --> 01:19:11.761
and planted your fucking
seed in 'em, man.

01:19:11.763 --> 01:19:13.329
Without 'em even knowing.

01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:14.364
That's not cool.

01:19:14.366 --> 01:19:16.199
It's quite obvious you're
fuckin' jealous, man.

01:19:16.201 --> 01:19:18.568
Just because nobody
recognizes you from shit.

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:19.769
Oh yeah, they recognize me.

01:19:19.771 --> 01:19:21.171
Is that my fault?

01:19:21.173 --> 01:19:22.104
No.

01:19:22.106 --> 01:19:23.473
And by the way, let me tell you,

01:19:23.475 --> 01:19:25.675
is it my fault,
it's not my fault,

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:29.145
that these women
that are accusing me

01:19:29.147 --> 01:19:33.249
of fathering their child and
not paying child support,

01:19:33.251 --> 01:19:34.751
that's not my responsibility.

01:19:34.753 --> 01:19:36.286
They make a pill for that.

01:19:36.288 --> 01:19:37.587
They should be taking that.

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:40.623
It's not your responsibility?

01:19:40.625 --> 01:19:41.791
It's not your responsibility?

01:19:41.793 --> 01:19:43.092
That's why you couldn't

01:19:43.094 --> 01:19:44.494
get a fuckin'
passport, motherfucker.

01:19:44.496 --> 01:19:46.429
When you promised me
you were gonna take me

01:19:46.431 --> 01:19:48.665
to the Toronto Film
Festival to introduce me

01:19:48.667 --> 01:19:51.468
to those guys that made
that shitty vampire movie.

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.402
You told me you
were gonna take me

01:19:52.404 --> 01:19:53.636
to introduce me to those guys

01:19:53.638 --> 01:19:56.439
and you told me to go
get a fucking passport.

01:19:56.441 --> 01:19:58.541
I spent 300 dollars getting
a rush on that motherfucker.

01:19:58.543 --> 01:20:00.109
And then I said, hey,
dude, are we going?

01:20:00.111 --> 01:20:01.110
And you're like,
dude, I can't go.

01:20:01.112 --> 01:20:02.245
I can't get a passport.

01:20:02.247 --> 01:20:03.313
You know why?

01:20:03.315 --> 01:20:04.782
Cause of your fucking
cock and your fucking seed

01:20:04.784 --> 01:20:06.182
spreading that you gotta go

01:20:06.184 --> 01:20:07.517
all over the fucking
place spreading around.

01:20:07.519 --> 01:20:08.686
That's why.

01:20:08.688 --> 01:20:10.487
Maybe if you weren't
such an asshole

01:20:10.489 --> 01:20:11.655
and stopped being so jealous

01:20:11.657 --> 01:20:13.089
and you didn't
cockblock all the time,

01:20:13.091 --> 01:20:14.625
then you might actually
get some pussy, too.

01:20:14.627 --> 01:20:15.626
Yeah.

01:20:15.628 --> 01:20:17.728
Quit cockblocking, man.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.697
You doin' these pop shots again.

01:20:19.699 --> 01:20:20.631
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:20:20.633 --> 01:20:22.566
I'm the asshole here tonight?

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:23.399
I'm the cockblocker?

01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:24.802
I'm the fucking
asshole here tonight?

01:20:24.804 --> 01:20:26.570
Because I'm trying
to save your asses

01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.572
from getting knocked
up by his fucking seed?

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:30.508
Or catching an STD or something?

01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:32.242
I've done nothing but
try to show all of you

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:33.711
a fucking good time!

01:20:33.713 --> 01:20:35.345
I've been spending all my money

01:20:35.347 --> 01:20:37.815
on getting us all this fucking
bullshit for your guys.

01:20:37.817 --> 01:20:39.850
Then what the fuck
are you arguing about?

01:20:39.852 --> 01:20:41.284
Oh my God.

01:20:41.286 --> 01:20:42.353
Bambi,
are you ready to go?

01:20:42.355 --> 01:20:43.154
Vinny?

01:20:44.824 --> 01:20:46.290
- Yeah.
- Oh no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:46.292 --> 01:20:47.223
- Yeah, you know what?
- What's happening?

01:20:47.225 --> 01:20:48.191
What's happening here?

01:20:48.193 --> 01:20:48.826
We're gonna go for a walk.

01:20:48.828 --> 01:20:50.193
I don't think so.

01:20:50.195 --> 01:20:51.729
You're not going
anywhere with this guy.

01:20:51.731 --> 01:20:54.163
Not the two of you, one
of you is coming with me.

01:20:54.165 --> 01:20:55.466
Now you can decide now

01:20:55.468 --> 01:20:56.534
or I'm gonna take the
matters into my hands.

01:20:56.536 --> 01:20:58.136
Yeah, I'm not going with you.

01:20:58.804 --> 01:21:00.237
Really?

01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:01.605
I'm trying to save
your life here

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:04.208
and you're gonna
take this guy's word?

01:21:04.210 --> 01:21:05.643
Even though he said all
this bullshit to you?

01:21:05.645 --> 01:21:06.877
He just admitted it to you

01:21:06.879 --> 01:21:08.178
and you're still
gonna go with him?

01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:09.680
I don't wanna go.

01:21:09.682 --> 01:21:11.882
Here's the deal, I'm
gonna flip this quarter.

01:21:11.884 --> 01:21:12.716
One of you is heads,
one of you tails.

01:21:12.718 --> 01:21:14.184
You know what?

01:21:14.186 --> 01:21:15.719
You're gonna be heads,
you're gonna be tails.

01:21:15.721 --> 01:21:17.488
And this fucking quarter
is gonna save your life.

01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:18.656
You know why?

01:21:18.658 --> 01:21:20.457
Because whoever comes with
me, doesn't get a fucking STD

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:22.593
and doesn't get knocked up
by this motherfucker, okay?

01:21:22.595 --> 01:21:25.462
And you're gonna get a big
fucking bonus for the night.

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:28.332
A little extra tip for
coming with me, okay?

01:21:28.334 --> 01:21:29.135
So here we go.

01:21:31.737 --> 01:21:33.571
Oh, it's heads.

01:21:33.573 --> 01:21:35.639
Looks like Bambi's
the big winner.

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:36.676
Let's go.

01:21:38.678 --> 01:21:39.610
Well,
you know what?

01:21:39.612 --> 01:21:40.578
You better just call me back.

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.212
You got, you have two
minutes to call me back.

01:21:42.214 --> 01:21:43.748
Two minutes.

01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:44.883
Call me the fuck back.

01:21:44.885 --> 01:21:46.383
Fuck you, Pat!

01:21:46.385 --> 01:21:47.752
Call me back.

01:21:47.754 --> 01:21:50.354
Why don't you, uh,
turn around here.

01:21:50.356 --> 01:21:53.290
I got this thing I've been
wanting to always try.

01:21:53.292 --> 01:21:54.661
Yeah, stay there.

01:21:56.763 --> 01:21:57.796
Yeah, this is it.

01:21:57.798 --> 01:21:58.699
This is it!

01:22:17.283 --> 01:22:18.717
Don't turn around now,

01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:20.454
I'm getting in the moment here.

01:22:23.857 --> 01:22:24.691
Alright.

01:22:35.235 --> 01:22:35.869
Ah, yeah.

01:22:38.271 --> 01:22:39.671
Yeah, alright.

01:22:39.673 --> 01:22:42.309
Oh, shit, I'm gonna fall over.

01:22:43.343 --> 01:22:44.442
Now when I give you the sign,

01:22:44.444 --> 01:22:46.211
- you turn around, okay?
- Okay.

01:22:46.213 --> 01:22:48.880
Alright, but you
gotta wait for the sign.

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:50.682
Ready boy, here we go.

01:22:50.684 --> 01:22:51.883
Alright.

01:23:00.827 --> 01:23:01.726
What do you think?

01:23:03.463 --> 01:23:05.298
You're ready, right?

01:23:06.466 --> 01:23:07.768
I am so ready, come on.

01:23:08.702 --> 01:23:10.404
Let's get this party started.

01:23:12.506 --> 01:23:13.808
This is what I've
been waiting for.

01:23:29.824 --> 01:23:30.723
I think that's good enough.

01:23:30.725 --> 01:23:31.759
I'm worked up.

01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:34.894
Oh, yeah.

01:23:34.896 --> 01:23:36.428
Oh, yeah.

01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:37.765
Suck that dick.

01:23:39.667 --> 01:23:42.300
Why are your nipples so small?

01:23:42.302 --> 01:23:44.704
Are you fucking
serious right now?

01:23:44.706 --> 01:23:45.838
I don't fucking know.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.873
I guess because my nipples
didn't go through puberty.

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:49.307
What do you want
me to do about it?

01:23:49.309 --> 01:23:51.409
Fucking get a nipple
job or something?

01:23:51.411 --> 01:23:53.378
Jesus Christ, just.

01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.416
Focus on what you're
doing, let's go.

01:23:56.651 --> 01:23:58.918
Just make sure you
use this and pull out.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.822
Super paranoid about
getting pregnant, okay?

01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.825
Okay.

01:24:07.528 --> 01:24:08.362
Alright.

01:24:09.664 --> 01:24:11.499
Oh, I'm opening it.

01:24:14.902 --> 01:24:16.602
Can I take this off?

01:24:16.604 --> 01:24:18.370
Sure.

01:24:18.372 --> 01:24:19.273
Oh, yeah.

01:24:26.714 --> 01:24:28.447
Alright, you ready?

01:24:28.449 --> 01:24:29.348
Yeah.

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:30.583
I'm ready.

01:24:30.585 --> 01:24:31.817
Okay.

01:24:31.819 --> 01:24:34.020
Okay.

01:24:34.022 --> 01:24:35.321
Oh, yeah.

01:24:35.323 --> 01:24:36.089
Oh yeah.

01:24:36.091 --> 01:24:36.924
Oh.

01:24:37.825 --> 01:24:38.860
Oh yeah.

01:24:39.827 --> 01:24:41.662
Why did
you shave like that?

01:24:43.831 --> 01:24:44.866
Really?

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.337
My pubic region looked even
worse than my face, okay?

01:24:51.339 --> 01:24:53.339
So I thought you
might appreciate it

01:24:53.341 --> 01:24:54.573
if I cleaned up a little bit

01:24:54.575 --> 01:24:56.475
if something like
this was to happen.

01:24:56.477 --> 01:24:57.944
And when I tried to shave it,

01:24:57.946 --> 01:25:00.679
I fucked up so I had to
shave the whole thing.

01:25:00.681 --> 01:25:01.580
Any more questions?

01:25:01.582 --> 01:25:03.016
Are we good?

01:25:03.018 --> 01:25:04.887
Alright, let's keep this going.

01:25:09.858 --> 01:25:11.124
God, I can't believe
it's been 10 years

01:25:11.126 --> 01:25:13.461
since I had a fucking
blowjob like this.

01:25:15.697 --> 01:25:17.666
Oh, shit, look
at those titties.

01:25:19.067 --> 01:25:19.902
Oh my God.

01:25:31.613 --> 01:25:33.613
Oh yeah.

01:25:33.615 --> 01:25:34.681
- You gonna cum?
- Yeah.

01:25:34.683 --> 01:25:35.916
- Yeah.
- Almost.

01:25:35.918 --> 01:25:37.083
Okay.

01:25:37.085 --> 01:25:38.084
Well, let's cum together.

01:25:38.086 --> 01:25:39.019
- Okay.
- Alright?

01:25:39.021 --> 01:25:40.520
I'm serious, pull out, though.

01:25:40.522 --> 01:25:42.022
I know!

01:25:42.024 --> 01:25:43.590
I'm next, we're gonna keep
it in the fucking family.

01:25:43.592 --> 01:25:45.025
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:25:45.027 --> 01:25:46.426
Oh, fuck yeah.

01:25:46.428 --> 01:25:47.060
I'm gonna cum.

01:25:47.062 --> 01:25:47.994
Okay, you ready?

01:25:47.996 --> 01:25:49.029
- Yeah.
- Together.

01:25:49.031 --> 01:25:50.897
Alright, here I cum.

01:25:57.472 --> 01:25:58.104
Who's your daddy?

01:25:58.106 --> 01:25:59.472
I'm your fucking daddy.

01:25:59.474 --> 01:26:00.740
I'm your fucking daddy.

01:26:00.742 --> 01:26:01.577
Oh my God.

01:26:28.037 --> 01:26:30.804
What was that?

01:26:30.806 --> 01:26:33.007
- What was what?
- That sound.

01:26:33.009 --> 01:26:35.109
I thought, I said
don't stop again.

01:26:35.111 --> 01:26:38.045
We told you about the
Bigfoot actor, right?

01:26:38.047 --> 01:26:40.014
That we hired a Bigfoot
actor to come out

01:26:40.016 --> 01:26:42.719
and scare fucking Pat tonight
for his bachelor party?

01:26:44.087 --> 01:26:46.854
It's just that actor
fucking around over there.

01:26:46.856 --> 01:26:47.788
Just fucking with Pat.

01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:48.956
Don't worry about it, okay?

01:26:48.958 --> 01:26:50.425
Can we, can we just

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:52.927
get this done?

01:26:52.929 --> 01:26:54.662
I paid you 600 bucks, okay?

01:26:54.664 --> 01:26:56.099
You said you would swallow, so.

01:26:57.499 --> 01:26:59.834
No more interruptions, I
don't care what happens,

01:26:59.836 --> 01:27:03.070
what noises you hear,
no more questions.

01:27:03.072 --> 01:27:05.573
You finish me off
and swallow, okay?

01:27:05.575 --> 01:27:06.974
We good?

01:27:06.976 --> 01:27:07.977
Awesome, let's do that.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:25.159
Fuck yeah.

01:27:25.161 --> 01:27:27.094
Oh, that's so good.

01:27:38.141 --> 01:27:38.775
Yeah.

01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:42.912
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:27:58.561 --> 01:27:59.995
- Whoa!
- Your dick!

01:27:59.997 --> 01:28:01.529
- Help me!

01:28:01.531 --> 01:28:03.265
Holy shit, you been Bobbited.

01:28:03.267 --> 01:28:05.566
She bit my fucking
nut off, Vinny!

01:28:05.568 --> 01:28:07.903
She bit my fucking nut off!

01:28:07.905 --> 01:28:08.937
Alright, man.

01:28:08.939 --> 01:28:11.106
We're gonna fix you up, hold on.

01:28:13.543 --> 01:28:16.078

01:28:19.116 --> 01:28:20.882

01:28:28.092 --> 01:28:29.024
Hey, it's not the
fucking actor, man!

01:28:29.026 --> 01:28:31.126
It's not the fucking
actor, it's a real one.

01:28:31.128 --> 01:28:32.127
Oh my God!

01:28:32.129 --> 01:28:33.195
Help me!

01:28:33.197 --> 01:28:34.129
See, I got it!

01:28:34.131 --> 01:28:35.130
- I got it!
- You got it!

01:28:35.132 --> 01:28:36.164
Let's go, come on!

01:28:36.166 --> 01:28:37.065
Let's fucking go!

01:28:37.067 --> 01:28:39.001
Vinny, help!

01:28:53.817 --> 01:28:55.684
We'll fix you up, man.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.921
Holy shit!

01:28:59.089 --> 01:28:59.921

01:28:59.923 --> 01:29:02.157
- Oh, shit.

01:29:02.159 --> 01:29:03.959
Oh, it's a bear trap.

01:29:03.961 --> 01:29:05.894
It's exactly what the park
ranger was telling us about!

01:29:05.896 --> 01:29:06.962
What?

01:29:06.964 --> 01:29:08.096
- Oh, oh, get it off!
- Oh god!

01:29:08.098 --> 01:29:09.731
Where am I gonna put this down?

01:29:09.733 --> 01:29:11.367
- Get it off!
- Yes, I know.

01:29:12.202 --> 01:29:13.369
One, two, three!

Pull it, fucking do it!

01:29:18.176 --> 01:29:19.074

01:29:30.155 --> 01:29:31.087
We pulled it off, man.

01:29:31.089 --> 01:29:33.291

01:29:45.836 --> 01:29:47.203

I'm not gonna leave

01:29:49.007 --> 01:29:51.174
- Come on.

- Remember that!
- I can't, man.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.112
I got you a lead
role in that this time.

01:29:56.114 --> 01:29:57.113
I can't do it, man.

01:29:57.115 --> 01:29:59.115
Dude, we gotta do it.

01:29:59.117 --> 01:30:00.349
We could fix you!

01:30:00.351 --> 01:30:01.683
Man, I'm fucked up bad, man.

01:30:01.685 --> 01:30:04.120
That Bigfoot actor I hired,

01:30:04.122 --> 01:30:05.121
I thought that was him but that

01:30:05.123 --> 01:30:07.256
was a real fuckin' Bigfoot, man.

01:30:07.258 --> 01:30:09.058
He was fuckin' a real one, dude.

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:10.860
He fuckin' knocked that fucking

01:30:10.862 --> 01:30:14.030
Bambi's head right off

01:30:14.032 --> 01:30:15.131

He's supposed to

There's no fucking way out, man.

01:30:29.147 --> 01:30:30.279
There's no way out.

01:30:30.281 --> 01:30:31.080
I'm gonna bleed out, man.

01:30:31.082 --> 01:30:32.315

01:30:33.452 --> 01:30:34.684
What'll I do?

Come on, bro!

We're gonna make it work.

01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:59.142
We're gonna make it work.

You're the lead!

01:31:07.119 --> 01:31:07.984
We're gonna do it!

01:31:07.986 --> 01:31:09.353
Oh God, man.

01:31:12.757 --> 01:31:13.423
Dude, wake up!

01:31:13.425 --> 01:31:14.491
- Wake up!
- What?

01:31:14.493 --> 01:31:15.325
- Wake up!

01:31:15.327 --> 01:31:16.360
What the fuck?

01:31:16.362 --> 01:31:17.294
What?

01:31:17.296 --> 01:31:18.028
Where, what, what's going?

01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:18.861
What the fuck?

01:31:18.863 --> 01:31:19.729
Hey, wake up!

01:31:19.731 --> 01:31:20.798
Wake up, man!

01:31:21.967 --> 01:31:22.800
Is that?

01:31:23.768 --> 01:31:25.235
Vinny, why do you have
a dick in your hand?

01:31:25.237 --> 01:31:26.937
Why is there a dick
and hand in your hands?

01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:28.205
Dude, I was getting laid, man.

01:31:28.207 --> 01:31:29.940
Jinx was getting his
fucking dick sucked

01:31:29.942 --> 01:31:31.842
but the fuckin' Bigfoot
was a real Bigfoot.

01:31:31.844 --> 01:31:34.244
Not the fucking actor
that he fuckin' hired.

01:31:34.246 --> 01:31:36.380
Bigfoot came and killed
both fuckin' strippers.

01:31:36.382 --> 01:31:38.115
Knocked one of their
fuckin' heads off.

01:31:38.117 --> 01:31:40.017
Fuckin' Jinx's junk
was in her fuckin'...

01:31:40.019 --> 01:31:41.084
Oh!

01:31:41.086 --> 01:31:43.453
And then Jinx passed
out, so I went over to him

01:31:43.455 --> 01:31:44.955
and he said something to me

01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:46.056
and we gotta go to a fucking,

01:31:46.058 --> 01:31:49.226
we gotta go to the van, but
he said the fucking car,

01:31:49.228 --> 01:31:52.462
all the phones are
gone and the Bigfoot

01:31:52.464 --> 01:31:55.399
fucking actor fucked
all the cars up, man.

01:31:55.401 --> 01:31:56.233
Do you know what I'm sayin'?

01:31:56.235 --> 01:31:57.467
- No!
- What?

01:31:57.469 --> 01:31:59.403
Dude, you're not
making any fucking sense!

01:31:59.405 --> 01:32:00.904
Wait, okay, okay,
okay, first of all,

01:32:00.906 --> 01:32:01.838
are you high?

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:02.839
Are you on drugs right now?

01:32:02.841 --> 01:32:04.341
No!

01:32:04.343 --> 01:32:06.009
We gotta find the phones,
we're gonna find the phones.

01:32:06.011 --> 01:32:07.277
He said something that.

01:32:07.279 --> 01:32:09.279
We gotta, we gotta get
something in the van.

01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:10.481
What?

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:11.949
There's, uh, Chad
smashed all the phones!

01:32:11.951 --> 01:32:13.418
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, they're in his

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:15.319
fucking tent right now,
they're in a million pieces.

01:32:15.321 --> 01:32:16.387
Oh, God.

01:32:16.389 --> 01:32:17.354
All of 'em?

01:32:17.356 --> 01:32:18.391
Yes!

01:32:19.392 --> 01:32:20.525
What are we gonna do, man?

01:32:20.527 --> 01:32:21.959
Oh, fuck.

01:32:21.961 --> 01:32:23.827
Oh, dude, what'd you
guys give me, man?

01:32:23.829 --> 01:32:25.028
Dude, don't worry, man.

01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:26.063
We just gave you
fuckin' pot brownies

01:32:26.065 --> 01:32:28.266
and some beer so you
could chill the fuck out.

01:32:28.268 --> 01:32:29.367
Now listen to me, listen!

01:32:29.369 --> 01:32:31.336
It's just you and me.

01:32:31.338 --> 01:32:34.004
We gotta get outta here
before that thing gets here.

01:32:34.006 --> 01:32:35.138
- Yeah, let's go!
- So we gotta go now.

01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:36.106
- Now!
- Now!

01:32:36.108 --> 01:32:37.342
- Let's go!
- Alright!

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:38.041
I gotta put this
shit on ice, man.

01:32:38.043 --> 01:32:39.310
We gotta go!

01:32:39.312 --> 01:32:40.877
I gotta
put this on ice.

01:32:40.879 --> 01:32:42.380
Okay, what are you doing?

01:32:42.382 --> 01:32:43.548
- I gotta wash my hands.
- Come on, man!

01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:44.948
I gotta wash my hands!

01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:46.184
I'll be right there.

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:47.019
Ah!

01:32:50.357 --> 01:32:51.556
- Oh, fuck!
- Where are you going?

01:32:51.558 --> 01:32:52.925
The lantern!

01:32:54.394 --> 01:32:55.326
Oh, there!

01:32:56.563 --> 01:32:58.096
Come on!

01:32:58.098 --> 01:32:59.130
Jinx!

01:32:59.132 --> 01:32:59.998
We're comin', baby!

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.032
Jinx!

01:33:01.034 --> 01:33:02.000
- Where is he?
- Oh, shit.

01:33:02.002 --> 01:33:02.833
Where is he?

01:33:02.835 --> 01:33:03.470
Oh my God.

01:33:05.138 --> 01:33:05.972
Is he dead?

01:33:07.307 --> 01:33:08.106
Oh, shit, Jinx.

01:33:08.108 --> 01:33:09.073
Oh, God.

01:33:09.075 --> 01:33:10.074
- Ooh, God.
- What?

01:33:10.076 --> 01:33:10.541
- Yeah, he's dead, man.
- What?

01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:11.978
That's gross.

01:33:12.946 --> 01:33:14.479
Jinx.

01:33:14.481 --> 01:33:15.413
Oh, fuck, what do we?

01:33:15.415 --> 01:33:17.350
Vinny, what do we do now?

01:33:21.354 --> 01:33:24.022
I told him this was
a bad idea, man.

01:33:24.024 --> 01:33:25.990
We'll have to kill him
off for Switchblade 5.

01:33:25.992 --> 01:33:26.626
What?

01:33:28.862 --> 01:33:30.463
I had a big part for you, bro.

01:33:31.498 --> 01:33:33.298
I was gonna give it to you.

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:34.432
Give you the fuckin' lead.

01:33:34.434 --> 01:33:36.567
What are you talking about?

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:38.104
Our movie, Switchblade 5.

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:39.937
Have you not seen it?

01:33:39.939 --> 01:33:40.940
You're in a movie?

01:33:42.108 --> 01:33:43.141
What kind of friend are you?

01:33:43.143 --> 01:33:44.409
Wait, did you?

01:33:44.411 --> 01:33:46.346
Did you say Switchblade 5?

01:33:47.447 --> 01:33:49.215
I haven't seen
four of his movies?

01:33:51.418 --> 01:33:53.353
Man, I'm sorry, Jinx.

01:33:55.055 --> 01:33:56.321
It's right here.

01:33:57.658 --> 01:33:59.057
What are you doing?

01:33:59.059 --> 01:34:00.325
Taking a piss.

01:34:00.327 --> 01:34:01.259
Haven't you heard
anything I've said?

01:34:01.261 --> 01:34:03.294
I don't give a shit, man.

01:34:03.296 --> 01:34:07.633
Pissing all over your fuckin'
trees, fuckin' Sasquatch!

01:34:07.635 --> 01:34:09.934
Fuckin' skunk-ape!

01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:12.970
Fuckin' Harry and the
Andersons bullshit.

01:34:12.972 --> 01:34:15.507
Oh, man.

01:34:15.509 --> 01:34:17.008
What?

01:34:21.415 --> 01:34:22.548
He's coming back.

01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:23.482
We gotta get to the van, man.

01:34:23.484 --> 01:34:24.516
- Let's get it.
- Go, go!

01:34:24.518 --> 01:34:26.052
Sorry, Jinx, ew.

01:34:28.322 --> 01:34:30.489
Hope the van is
still around here.

01:34:30.491 --> 01:34:31.423
Where are we going?

01:34:34.095 --> 01:34:35.394
Oh shit,.

01:34:35.396 --> 01:34:37.396
Do you remember
where that van's at?

01:34:37.398 --> 01:34:38.332
What van?

01:34:40.101 --> 01:34:41.333
The van.

01:34:41.335 --> 01:34:43.102
What, the van
you brought me in?

01:34:43.104 --> 01:34:44.103
Yeah.

01:34:44.105 --> 01:34:45.106
When I had the
hood on my head?

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.940
Oh, yeah.

01:34:47.942 --> 01:34:49.041
Fuck, we're fucked.

01:34:49.043 --> 01:34:49.942
Shh!

01:34:51.445 --> 01:34:52.311
- Go, we should go.
- Yeah, let's go.

01:34:52.313 --> 01:34:54.513
- Come on, we gotta find it.
- Go, go!

01:34:56.717 --> 01:34:58.450
- Oh, go, man!
- Come on, come on.

01:34:58.452 --> 01:35:00.187
- Go!
- Yeah, I know!

01:35:02.156 --> 01:35:03.188
I think it's this way!

01:35:03.190 --> 01:35:05.157
- Go.
- I'm runnin', man!

01:35:09.497 --> 01:35:10.697
Oh, God.

01:35:10.699 --> 01:35:12.900
Come on, get up and run!

01:35:16.404 --> 01:35:17.269
Okay.

01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:19.606
- Go on the other...
- Tires, get down.

01:35:19.608 --> 01:35:22.074
Oh, this tire's flat!

01:35:22.076 --> 01:35:23.475
Is that one flat, too?

01:35:23.477 --> 01:35:24.476
Yes, fuck!

01:35:24.478 --> 01:35:26.211
This is all your fuckin' fault!

01:35:26.213 --> 01:35:27.614
- My fault?
- Yes, your fault.

01:35:27.616 --> 01:35:28.548
You took a piss.

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:29.482
I told you not to take a piss!

01:35:29.484 --> 01:35:30.416
He's got your fuckin' scent.

01:35:30.418 --> 01:35:31.216
Don't worry about that, man.

01:35:31.218 --> 01:35:31.984
That's all a myth.

01:35:31.986 --> 01:35:32.685
A myth?

01:35:32.687 --> 01:35:34.319
It's not a fuckin' myth.

01:35:34.321 --> 01:35:35.254
That thing is not gonna stop

01:35:35.256 --> 01:35:36.456
until it fuckin' finds you, man.

01:35:36.458 --> 01:35:37.757
Hey, we got this
under control.

01:35:37.759 --> 01:35:38.591
Oh, do we?

01:35:38.593 --> 01:35:40.025
Do we really?

01:35:40.027 --> 01:35:40.627
I'll tell you
one thing, though.

01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:43.061
Just like Switchblade 3.

01:35:43.063 --> 01:35:44.764
I drove a van just like
this with no tires,

01:35:44.766 --> 01:35:46.433
I'll get us out of
here in no time.

01:35:46.435 --> 01:35:47.734
Shut up, shut up!

01:35:47.736 --> 01:35:49.302
This isn't a fuckin' movie!

01:35:49.304 --> 01:35:50.503
This is real life
and that thing's

01:35:50.505 --> 01:35:52.607
is gonna fucking kill us!

01:35:55.677 --> 01:35:56.944
Don't, don't!

01:36:02.317 --> 01:36:03.251
He's there?

01:36:09.391 --> 01:36:10.423
Oh, fuck, it's coming.

01:36:10.425 --> 01:36:12.659
- What?
- It's coming, go, go.

01:36:12.661 --> 01:36:13.660
Get in the van.

01:36:13.662 --> 01:36:14.496
Get in!

01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:22.671
- Got the keys?
- Yeah.

01:36:24.606 --> 01:36:27.175
Key, where's the fuckin' key?

01:36:29.177 --> 01:36:30.412
Where's the fuckin' keys?

01:36:31.446 --> 01:36:32.612
Damn, fuck!

01:36:32.614 --> 01:36:35.148
- He fuckin' took the key.
- Who?

01:36:35.150 --> 01:36:36.716
The fuckin' Bigfoot actor guy

01:36:36.718 --> 01:36:38.685
that we fuckin' hired for this.

01:36:38.687 --> 01:36:40.186
He messed up all the cars,

01:36:40.188 --> 01:36:41.521
now he took the fuckin' keys.

01:36:41.523 --> 01:36:44.090
- Fuck!
- Son of a bitch.

01:36:44.092 --> 01:36:45.193
- Betsy!
- What?

01:36:46.094 --> 01:36:47.660
Oh, yes!

01:36:47.662 --> 01:36:48.698
Oh!

01:36:50.599 --> 01:36:51.431
That's what he
was talking about.

01:36:51.433 --> 01:36:53.132
- Who?
- Jinx!

01:36:53.134 --> 01:36:54.702
That's why he wanted
us to come to the van.

01:36:54.704 --> 01:36:56.369
- To get the gun.
- Yes, yeah!

01:36:56.371 --> 01:36:57.305
- Oh.
- Shh.

01:36:59.140 --> 01:37:00.674
I think he's still
here, get down.

01:37:00.676 --> 01:37:01.609
- Get down.
- Oh, dude.

01:37:01.611 --> 01:37:02.643
Oh, God, holy shit.

01:37:02.645 --> 01:37:03.611
Look at that.

01:37:03.613 --> 01:37:05.646
That's the real one, right.

01:37:05.648 --> 01:37:07.447
Oh, fuck, we're gonna die.

01:37:07.449 --> 01:37:08.584
We're gonna die.

01:37:10.185 --> 01:37:12.653
Where'd he go?

01:37:12.655 --> 01:37:13.654
Is it gone?

01:37:13.656 --> 01:37:15.823
I hope it's gone.

01:37:15.825 --> 01:37:17.092
Fuck, okay.

01:37:22.798 --> 01:37:23.631
- Think he's gone?
- Is he gone?

01:37:23.633 --> 01:37:24.667
Shh.

01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:32.239
He's not gone!
(Pat and Vinny scream

01:37:32.241 --> 01:37:32.873
Go away!

01:37:32.875 --> 01:37:33.807
Oh, God!

01:37:33.809 --> 01:37:35.174
- Oh, shit!
- Vinny!

01:37:35.176 --> 01:37:35.809
Where is he?

01:37:35.811 --> 01:37:36.644
Where is he?

01:37:39.515 --> 01:37:40.848
Pat?

01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:42.883
Pat!

01:37:42.885 --> 01:37:45.619
Patrick Anthony Taylor!

01:37:45.621 --> 01:37:46.656
Patrick?

01:37:48.257 --> 01:37:49.290
Hello?

01:37:49.292 --> 01:37:50.126
Patrick!

01:37:53.162 --> 01:37:54.263
What the hell is that?

01:37:55.731 --> 01:37:56.897
What?

01:38:03.139 --> 01:38:04.605
Oh nice, you broke your phone.

01:38:04.607 --> 01:38:06.309
Still found you, motherfucker.

01:38:07.777 --> 01:38:09.510
What is this?

01:38:09.512 --> 01:38:10.346
Huh?

01:38:12.615 --> 01:38:13.449
Beer!

01:38:14.317 --> 01:38:15.151
Patrick!

01:38:16.019 --> 01:38:18.654
Jinx, you lying
motherfucker, I knew it!

01:38:20.323 --> 01:38:21.890
What is this?

01:38:21.892 --> 01:38:23.691
Oh, that's cute.

01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:25.894
That's cute, guys.

01:38:25.896 --> 01:38:28.697
Nice little Halloween
party, adorable.

01:38:28.699 --> 01:38:29.764
Great.

01:38:29.766 --> 01:38:30.600
What?

01:38:31.534 --> 01:38:32.901
What?

01:38:32.903 --> 01:38:35.804
Is this your little
bromance souvenir?

01:38:35.806 --> 01:38:38.472
That's great, that's
oh my god, it's real!

01:38:38.474 --> 01:38:39.808
No!

01:38:39.810 --> 01:38:40.642
Oh my God!

01:38:40.644 --> 01:38:41.910
Oh my God, oh my God!

01:38:41.912 --> 01:38:43.377
9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

01:38:43.379 --> 01:38:44.613
Yes, hello, I'm
in Cherokee Creek

01:38:44.615 --> 01:38:47.348
and there's a fucking cooler
with a hand and a penis in it.

01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:48.583
And there's beer in it!

01:38:48.585 --> 01:38:49.918
And my boyfriend
was supposed to be

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:51.720
at the bachelor party,
I can't find him

01:38:51.722 --> 01:38:53.287
or his friends anywhere.

01:38:53.289 --> 01:38:55.189
Please, you gotta
get here quick!

01:38:55.191 --> 01:38:56.256
Cherokee Creek!

01:38:56.258 --> 01:38:57.559
Get here quick!

01:38:57.561 --> 01:38:58.395
Oh, God.

01:38:59.663 --> 01:39:00.795
Patrick!

01:39:00.797 --> 01:39:01.830
Patrick!

01:39:01.832 --> 01:39:02.831
Jinx!

01:39:02.833 --> 01:39:03.832
Patrick!

01:39:03.834 --> 01:39:05.400
Where are you?

01:39:05.402 --> 01:39:06.635
Patrick?

01:39:06.637 --> 01:39:07.669
Patrick!

01:39:07.671 --> 01:39:08.937
Patrick!

01:39:08.939 --> 01:39:09.804
Patrick!

01:39:09.806 --> 01:39:11.406
Where is it?

01:39:11.408 --> 01:39:12.843
What is it doing?

01:39:15.679 --> 01:39:17.445
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:39:17.447 --> 01:39:19.714
- Yeah.
- I'm alright.

01:39:19.716 --> 01:39:21.983
- It's okay.
- I'm alright.

01:39:21.985 --> 01:39:22.817
I mean it just come and play...

01:39:22.819 --> 01:39:23.818
Yeah, we're alright.

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:24.886
- We're alright.
- We're good.

01:39:24.888 --> 01:39:25.720
We're good.

01:39:35.499 --> 01:39:37.265
Do you see it?

01:39:37.267 --> 01:39:38.435
No, come on.

01:39:43.907 --> 01:39:44.741
Shh!

01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:48.578
Okay, let's go.

01:39:49.579 --> 01:39:50.779
What the fuck?

01:39:50.781 --> 01:39:52.480
Oh, come on!

01:39:52.482 --> 01:39:53.715
- Of course.
- Fuck!

01:39:53.717 --> 01:39:54.783
Fucking tires are flat.

01:39:54.785 --> 01:39:55.617
Shh.

01:39:55.619 --> 01:39:56.687
Alright, locked?

01:39:57.754 --> 01:39:59.287
It's locked.

01:39:59.289 --> 01:40:00.190
Maybe this side.

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:03.895
Fuck.

01:40:04.896 --> 01:40:05.928
Locked, God damn it.

01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:07.765
Hey, man, these aren't flat.

01:40:09.499 --> 01:40:10.802
Hey, check the other side.

01:40:13.871 --> 01:40:15.437
- No.
- Really?

01:40:15.439 --> 01:40:16.605
- Uh huh.
- Fuckin' hot.

01:40:16.607 --> 01:40:17.773
- Ah!
- Shit.

01:40:17.775 --> 01:40:18.974
- Of course.
- Keys.

01:40:18.976 --> 01:40:19.809
We need keys.

01:40:19.811 --> 01:40:20.845
Whose car is this?

01:40:21.913 --> 01:40:23.946
Oh, I bet it's
the stripper's car!

01:40:23.948 --> 01:40:24.947
Oh, yeah.

01:40:24.949 --> 01:40:25.881
Uh, Brick!

01:40:25.883 --> 01:40:26.816
Brick probably has the keys!

01:40:26.818 --> 01:40:27.683
Brick?

01:40:27.685 --> 01:40:29.652
Uh, yeah, you know
like the bouncer.

01:40:29.654 --> 01:40:30.619
- Oh.
- Come on.

01:40:30.621 --> 01:40:32.557
Let's go check on that.

01:40:48.539 --> 01:40:49.772
What the fuck is that?

01:40:49.774 --> 01:40:51.275
It's the tree.

01:40:54.512 --> 01:40:55.813
Past the tree.

01:40:56.714 --> 01:40:57.546
What is that?

01:40:57.548 --> 01:40:58.850
Shh, get down.

01:41:01.786 --> 01:41:03.719
That's, oh my God.

01:41:03.721 --> 01:41:06.522
- Is that him?
- I don't fucking know.

01:41:06.524 --> 01:41:07.456
What do you mean you
don't fucking know?

01:41:07.458 --> 01:41:08.591
You're the fuckin' expert.

01:41:08.593 --> 01:41:10.060
Dude, there's a real one,
there's a fuckin' fake one.

01:41:10.062 --> 01:41:12.363
How am I supposed to
know the difference?

01:41:13.397 --> 01:41:14.665
Well, fuckin' shoot it.

01:41:15.533 --> 01:41:16.365
You got the gun.

01:41:16.367 --> 01:41:17.033
You shoot it.

01:41:17.035 --> 01:41:17.869
Here.

01:41:20.438 --> 01:41:21.537
I never shot one before.

01:41:21.539 --> 01:41:22.905
You fuckin' kidding me?

01:41:22.907 --> 01:41:24.975
You're in all those
action movies.

01:41:24.977 --> 01:41:26.778
Yeah, but I gotta use a knife.

01:41:28.046 --> 01:41:29.478
Okay.

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.881
Just fucking
shoot it, come on.

01:41:30.883 --> 01:41:32.115
Let's get the fuck outta here.

01:41:32.117 --> 01:41:33.049
Come on, man, I'm
still pretty fucked up

01:41:33.051 --> 01:41:34.485
off that thing you gave me.

01:41:35.586 --> 01:41:37.720
I don't like it,
man, I don't like it.

01:41:37.722 --> 01:41:39.823
Let's just, let's
just find the keys.

01:41:39.825 --> 01:41:40.957
Let's find the
dude that's got 'em

01:41:40.959 --> 01:41:42.893
and get the fuck outta here.

01:41:42.895 --> 01:41:43.927
Cause what if I miss?

01:41:43.929 --> 01:41:45.394
I just piss it off.

01:41:45.396 --> 01:41:46.830
- Alright, alright.
- Yeah.

01:41:46.832 --> 01:41:48.664
Just wait till, just
wait till it leaves.

01:41:48.666 --> 01:41:49.467
Okay.

01:41:51.036 --> 01:41:52.368
- There it goes.
- There it goes.

01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:53.435
There it goes.

01:41:53.437 --> 01:41:53.906
- Hey, let's go that way.
- Alright.

01:41:55.406 --> 01:41:56.008
Go, go.

01:42:05.117 --> 01:42:06.082
What the fuck?

01:42:06.084 --> 01:42:07.483
Get the fuck...

01:42:07.485 --> 01:42:08.952
oh, oh, it's Brick!

01:42:08.954 --> 01:42:10.086
Hey, oh, fuckin'.

01:42:10.088 --> 01:42:11.021
Oh, Jesus.

01:42:11.023 --> 01:42:13.723
- Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.

01:42:13.725 --> 01:42:14.591
Fuck!

01:42:14.593 --> 01:42:15.725
Check him for keys.

01:42:15.727 --> 01:42:16.562
Keys.

01:42:21.967 --> 01:42:23.001
Look.

01:42:23.936 --> 01:42:24.901
Man, there's nothing.

01:42:24.903 --> 01:42:26.036
Fuck!

01:42:26.038 --> 01:42:27.070
Um.

01:42:27.072 --> 01:42:28.004
The strippers.

01:42:28.006 --> 01:42:29.172
The strippers gotta have 'em.

01:42:29.174 --> 01:42:30.774
I know where
they're at, come on.

01:42:30.776 --> 01:42:31.610
Come on.

01:42:33.612 --> 01:42:34.578
There they are.

01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:35.679
- Oh, yes.
- Oh my God.

01:42:35.681 --> 01:42:36.513
They gotta have it, man.

01:42:36.515 --> 01:42:37.714
Go check her.

01:42:37.716 --> 01:42:38.717
I'll check this one.

01:42:39.885 --> 01:42:40.984
Fuck.

01:42:40.986 --> 01:42:41.820
Um, okay.

01:42:43.856 --> 01:42:44.690
Fuck.

01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:52.464
Fuck.

01:42:54.833 --> 01:42:55.634
Fuck.

01:42:59.438 --> 01:43:04.143
Gross!

01:43:05.211 --> 01:43:06.043
Fuck yeah!

01:43:06.045 --> 01:43:07.080
I got it!

01:43:07.981 --> 01:43:09.146
Oh, shit.

01:43:09.148 --> 01:43:11.115
Vinny, behind you!

01:43:15.154 --> 01:43:16.153
Holy shit.

01:43:32.672 --> 01:43:33.505
Shit!

01:43:34.173 --> 01:43:35.108
I got it.

01:43:39.145 --> 01:43:43.180
Fuck you, man!

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:48.521
Fuck, Vinny.

01:43:58.164 --> 01:43:59.664
What the fuck?

01:43:59.666 --> 01:44:00.865
Gotta get the key.

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:02.733
I need the key.

01:44:02.735 --> 01:44:04.001
Oh.

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:08.005
It was supposed to
be you and me, man.

01:44:08.007 --> 01:44:10.107
Oh, fuck, where is it?

01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:11.142
Oh!

01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:11.976
Oh!

01:44:11.978 --> 01:44:13.044
Oh, fuck!

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:13.880
Oh, fuck!

01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.524
Thanks, man.

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:23.749
You son of a bitch!

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:32.993
Oh my God!

01:45:35.095 --> 01:45:37.662
Oh my God, I'm so
glad to see you.

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:38.665
Look at you.

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.967
Why the hell were
you shooting at me?

01:45:41.969 --> 01:45:42.901
Are you crazy?

01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:44.136
I wasn't shooting at you,

01:45:44.138 --> 01:45:45.103
I was shooting at that
bear or whatever it was.

01:45:45.105 --> 01:45:46.671
It was attacking you!

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:48.040
It was behind you!

01:45:48.042 --> 01:45:48.675
See?

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:52.345
- What was that?
- You killed it!

01:45:52.347 --> 01:45:53.945
That's Bigfoot!

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:55.283
That is fuckin' Bigfoot.

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:57.783
And you killed it.

01:45:57.785 --> 01:45:59.586
He killed everybody.

01:46:00.255 --> 01:46:01.753
Everybody's dead.

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:02.589
Almost got me.

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.991
- But I made it.
- Mmhmm.

01:46:05.993 --> 01:46:07.393
And you're lucky
I didn't kill you

01:46:07.395 --> 01:46:10.229
for everything you have
put me through tonight.

01:46:10.231 --> 01:46:12.030
You betrayed me!

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:14.200
You put all those videos
all over my social media

01:46:14.202 --> 01:46:16.001
accounts of those
strippers all over you.

01:46:16.003 --> 01:46:17.136
Why would you do that?

01:46:17.138 --> 01:46:18.837
Are you fuckin' serious?

01:46:18.839 --> 01:46:20.073
Did you hear me?

01:46:20.075 --> 01:46:21.207
- Everybody's dead!
- Yes, I heard you!

01:46:21.209 --> 01:46:22.975
I almost died!

01:46:22.977 --> 01:46:26.145
But you broke
your promise to me.

01:46:26.147 --> 01:46:28.081
Everybody that
I came here with,

01:46:28.083 --> 01:46:30.151
Jinx, they're all dead.

01:46:31.252 --> 01:46:33.652
- I heard you.
- I am done.

01:46:33.654 --> 01:46:34.921
You hear me?

01:46:34.923 --> 01:46:37.290
Done being your pussy
whipped little bitch.

01:46:37.292 --> 01:46:40.326
I didn't put any videos on
your social media account.

01:46:40.328 --> 01:46:42.762
Okay, so I'd appreciate
it if you cutted me

01:46:42.764 --> 01:46:44.430
a little fuckin' slack.

01:46:44.432 --> 01:46:45.731
And to top it all off,

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:47.266
I don't know what happened.

01:46:47.268 --> 01:46:49.168
The last thing
that I can remember

01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:53.439
is I was arguing with
Jinx about the strippers

01:46:53.441 --> 01:46:55.041
you're so concerned with.

01:46:55.043 --> 01:46:57.276
Next thing I know, I
get woken up by Vinny

01:46:57.278 --> 01:46:59.779
and he's got a
fucking severed dick

01:46:59.781 --> 01:47:01.916
and another ripped off
hand just in his hands.

01:47:04.419 --> 01:47:06.185
How do you know this
wasn't one of Jinx's pranks?

01:47:06.187 --> 01:47:07.854
Huh?

01:47:07.856 --> 01:47:09.088
He's friends with all of
the special effects people,

01:47:09.090 --> 01:47:10.723
he does this stuff all the time,

01:47:10.725 --> 01:47:13.259
I've personally
never trusted him

01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:15.128
and because he promised
nobody would get hurt,

01:47:15.130 --> 01:47:17.096
- I said, okay, fine.
- Okay, stop.

01:47:17.098 --> 01:47:18.231
And he promised
there'd be no strippers!

01:47:18.233 --> 01:47:20.066
And what was there?

01:47:20.068 --> 01:47:21.234
Strippers!

01:47:21.236 --> 01:47:22.168
Well, you're worried
about strippers?

01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:24.338
What you think I'm doing
something out here?

01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:26.708
Besides fighting for
my own fuckin' life?

01:47:28.109 --> 01:47:31.210
And if you're so worried
about what I'm doing, what?

01:47:31.212 --> 01:47:32.379
You're insecure?

01:47:32.381 --> 01:47:34.248
You think I was doing
something wrong?

01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:35.081
What about you?

01:47:35.083 --> 01:47:37.251
Feel like you're
missing something.

01:47:37.253 --> 01:47:38.385
So where were you at tonight?

01:47:38.387 --> 01:47:40.420
While I was trying to not die?

01:47:42.391 --> 01:47:43.956
Do you hear that?

01:47:43.958 --> 01:47:45.392
It's sirens.

01:47:45.394 --> 01:47:47.860
I called the sheriff
at the camp site!

01:47:47.862 --> 01:47:48.895
Let's go, let's get him!

01:48:07.016 --> 01:48:07.948
I killed him!

01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:08.882
I shot him, he's back there.

01:48:08.884 --> 01:48:10.284
Drop your weapon!

01:48:10.286 --> 01:48:11.251
- No, no, you gotta go see.
- Drop that weapon.

01:48:11.253 --> 01:48:13.055
- I'm sorry.
- Up here.

01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:16.190
Oh, I'd love to get

01:48:16.192 --> 01:48:17.424
and smell like beef
in the morning.

01:48:17.426 --> 01:48:18.992
Makes me horny.

01:48:18.994 --> 01:48:20.194
What?

01:48:20.196 --> 01:48:21.161
- What have we got here?
- Oh my goodness,

01:48:21.163 --> 01:48:23.263
- what is this?
- I don't know.

01:48:23.265 --> 01:48:24.099
But it's not.

01:48:25.167 --> 01:48:26.466
- He's dead.
- Throw him over.

01:48:26.468 --> 01:48:28.902
On my count, one, two, three.

01:48:30.339 --> 01:48:32.039
God, he stinks.

01:48:32.041 --> 01:48:33.140
You gotta be kidding me.

01:48:33.142 --> 01:48:34.408
No, I'm serious.

01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:36.143
That's the story you
expect us to believe?

01:48:36.145 --> 01:48:37.277
Another Bigfoot story?

01:48:37.279 --> 01:48:38.345
He's right there.

01:48:38.347 --> 01:48:39.479
You know how many times
we get pulled out here

01:48:39.481 --> 01:48:41.048
for these Bigfoot stories?

01:48:41.050 --> 01:48:42.816
I just shot him,
he's right there

01:48:42.818 --> 01:48:46.353
if you just please come
with us, you will see him!

01:48:46.355 --> 01:48:48.989
First of all, son, you're
on restricted property.

01:48:48.991 --> 01:48:51.925
That's a 300 dollar
fine per person.

01:48:51.927 --> 01:48:54.027
Second, why didn't you
just go to a titty bar

01:48:54.029 --> 01:48:55.195
like anybody else?

01:48:55.197 --> 01:48:58.832
I mean, who comes out in the
woods for a bachelor party?

01:48:58.834 --> 01:48:59.467
Nobody.

01:48:59.469 --> 01:49:00.401
Doesn't make sense.

01:49:00.403 --> 01:49:01.868
Sir.

01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:05.373
With all due respect,
I am vehemently opposed

01:49:05.375 --> 01:49:09.310
to titty bars and camping is
all I would allow him to do.

01:49:09.312 --> 01:49:11.312
All you would allow him to do?

01:49:11.314 --> 01:49:12.946
Well, you're cool
with him coming out

01:49:12.948 --> 01:49:14.415
with his friends into
a restricted area

01:49:14.417 --> 01:49:15.516
and getting 'em all killed?

01:49:15.518 --> 01:49:17.150
That doesn't make sense, ma'am.

01:49:17.152 --> 01:49:19.320
I didn't know they
would be trespassing.

01:49:19.322 --> 01:49:21.822
I didn't know this would
be a restricted area.

01:49:21.824 --> 01:49:23.358
I didn't know
there'd be strippers,

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:25.993
I didn't know there'd be an
actor in a Bigfoot costume!

01:49:25.995 --> 01:49:26.994
Of course there's
gonna be strippers,

01:49:26.996 --> 01:49:28.396
he's a man, isn't he?

01:49:28.398 --> 01:49:30.367
What kind of controlling
woman are you?

01:49:31.468 --> 01:49:32.966
There he is!

01:49:32.968 --> 01:49:34.903
- Have a look for yourself.
- That's him!

01:49:36.373 --> 01:49:37.205
Oh God, that's him.

01:49:42.479 --> 01:49:44.147
Let's take a
look at this thing.

01:49:46.383 --> 01:49:48.182
Here's your Bigfoot, lady.

01:49:49.352 --> 01:49:52.620
Looks like you killed this
nice young man for no reason.

01:49:52.622 --> 01:49:54.622
- No, I, no.
- No!

01:49:54.624 --> 01:49:56.457
Stop, that is not what it was.

01:49:56.459 --> 01:49:57.959
Okay, that, no, no, no.

01:49:57.961 --> 01:49:58.893
You said you knew
about the party...

01:49:58.895 --> 01:50:00.328
That's not what I shot!

01:50:00.330 --> 01:50:01.262
- I shot, I shot a Bigfoot!
- You said you knew

01:50:01.264 --> 01:50:03.097
about the party and the plan.

01:50:03.099 --> 01:50:04.165
Why didn't you check it out

01:50:04.167 --> 01:50:06.134
before you opened fire
and killed this poor kid?

01:50:06.136 --> 01:50:08.369
I don't know,
I didn't mean to!

01:50:08.371 --> 01:50:09.437
You think a kid did all this?

01:50:09.439 --> 01:50:10.872
We're gonna cuff 'em.

01:50:10.874 --> 01:50:12.240
We're gonna take you in
for more questioning.

01:50:12.242 --> 01:50:13.174
We'll get to the bottom of this.

01:50:13.176 --> 01:50:14.409
It's alright, it'll be good.

01:50:14.411 --> 01:50:16.544
We'll find out exactly
what happened out here.

01:50:16.546 --> 01:50:18.146
Remain calm, okay?

01:50:18.148 --> 01:50:19.047
We're innocent.

01:50:19.049 --> 01:50:20.014
We didn't do anything!

01:50:20.016 --> 01:50:21.215
We're innocent!

01:50:21.217 --> 01:50:22.383
We need to reduce
the drama, okay?

01:50:22.385 --> 01:50:24.352
- Everyone just calm down.
- What drama?

01:50:24.354 --> 01:50:26.555
You are arresting
us for no reason.

01:50:26.557 --> 01:50:27.422
You think I did this?

01:50:27.424 --> 01:50:29.257
You think I did this?

01:50:29.259 --> 01:50:30.458
We're innocent!

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.426
Have the
right to remain silent.

01:50:31.428 --> 01:50:33.428
Anything you say can and will be

01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:35.431
used against you in
the court of law.

01:50:35.433 --> 01:50:37.899
Get off, we're innocent!

01:50:37.901 --> 01:50:38.600
We're innocent!

01:50:38.602 --> 01:50:39.437
Sir, sir!

01:50:40.937 --> 01:50:42.438
We are innocent, please.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.472
Please.

01:50:43.474 --> 01:50:45.239
Get in the damn car.

01:50:45.241 --> 01:50:46.941
This is bullshit.

01:50:46.943 --> 01:50:48.410
Hey!

01:50:48.412 --> 01:50:49.378
Hey, that's her!

01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.346
- Hey, that's her!
- Let's go.

01:50:50.348 --> 01:50:51.513
That's the park ranger.

01:50:51.515 --> 01:50:54.550
Son, you're just diggin'
a deeper hole with the lies.

01:50:54.552 --> 01:50:55.351
Just be quiet, okay?

01:50:55.353 --> 01:50:57.085
Tell it to the
judge, if you want.

01:50:57.087 --> 01:50:58.654
- Let's go.
- Come on!

01:50:58.656 --> 01:51:00.289
- Get in the car!
- Look at her boobs!

01:51:00.291 --> 01:51:01.690
- Get in the car.
- Get him in the car, deputy.

01:51:01.692 --> 01:51:02.558
Let's go!

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:03.459
Get him outta here.

01:51:03.461 --> 01:51:04.593
No, no, no!

01:51:04.595 --> 01:51:06.328
- No, no!
- Let's go.

01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:07.429
Come on.

01:51:07.431 --> 01:51:08.996
Let go!

01:51:08.998 --> 01:51:10.265
Look, we're innocent!

01:51:10.267 --> 01:51:11.233
Sheriff, I don't know
what he's talking about.

01:51:11.235 --> 01:51:15.170
I've never seen that
man in my entire life.

01:51:15.172 --> 01:51:16.005
Let me see it.

01:51:17.974 --> 01:51:19.610
Vinny Blades.

01:51:20.578 --> 01:51:21.410
What did I tell you about

01:51:21.412 --> 01:51:23.712
hanging out with
these damn campers?

01:51:23.714 --> 01:51:25.314
They get you in
trouble every time.

01:51:50.007 --> 01:51:52.076
God, a hand and a cock.

01:51:53.511 --> 01:51:54.311
Oh.

01:51:57.081 --> 01:51:58.480
How about a handjob, buddy, huh?

01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:01.283
What'd you do, little lady?

01:52:01.285 --> 01:52:03.485
What'd you do to get
your head knocked off?

01:52:05.022 --> 01:52:06.625
I found another one!

01:52:12.664 --> 01:52:13.998
What the fuck?

01:52:19.303 --> 01:52:20.503
- Yeah!
- Alright!

01:52:20.505 --> 01:52:21.404
Look at these motherfuckers!

01:52:21.406 --> 01:52:22.472
Look at these guys.

01:52:22.474 --> 01:52:23.673
You fuckin' made it
through the fuckin' movie!

01:52:23.675 --> 01:52:24.574
Cherokee Creek!

01:52:24.576 --> 01:52:27.209
Cherokee
Creek, Cherokee Creek!

01:52:27.211 --> 01:52:29.479
Cherokee Creek, Cherokee Creek!

01:52:29.481 --> 01:52:30.547
Oh, shit, hey.

01:52:30.549 --> 01:52:31.381
Kids, if you're watching this,

01:52:31.383 --> 01:52:33.182
don't fuckin' play
with guns, okay?

01:52:33.184 --> 01:52:34.617
But you do need to
say Cherokee Creek

01:52:34.619 --> 01:52:36.553
and, you know, you can come
up with your own dance.

01:52:36.555 --> 01:52:38.020
You don't have to
do this one but,

01:52:38.022 --> 01:52:39.589
come up with some kind
of Cherokee Creek dance

01:52:39.591 --> 01:52:42.559
- and put that shit online.
- Yeah, you could do a dance!

01:52:42.561 --> 01:52:46.028
I want you to tell every
motherfucker out there.

01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:48.030
- Motherfucker!
- Motherfucker about our movie

01:52:48.032 --> 01:52:49.699
Cherokee Creek
because we made this

01:52:49.701 --> 01:52:50.600
fucking movie for you guys.

01:52:50.602 --> 01:52:52.702
We wanted to see a
kickass Bigfoot movie

01:52:52.704 --> 01:52:54.270
that had the tits and
the ass and everything.

01:52:54.272 --> 01:52:55.638
Tits!

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.207
And we didn't necessarily
wanna see a dick

01:52:57.209 --> 01:52:58.508
in there but everybody else
was putting dicks in movies

01:52:58.510 --> 01:53:00.043
and we did our research,
so we're like, fuck it.

01:53:00.045 --> 01:53:02.479
I'll put a dick in there
and the dick is funny.

01:53:02.481 --> 01:53:03.680
I think the dick's pretty funny.

01:53:03.682 --> 01:53:05.548
I think the dicks
are funny, yeah.

01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:06.516
The dick in the
movie was funny.

01:53:06.518 --> 01:53:08.518
You get a great laugh
out of the motherfucker.

01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:09.352
- Hey, you get...
- Anyway.

01:53:09.354 --> 01:53:11.154
You get a laugh
with the dicks.

01:53:11.156 --> 01:53:12.388
I laughed.

01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:14.491
Anyway, so get down
to some business.

01:53:14.493 --> 01:53:16.326
- You motherfuckers.
- Yous.

01:53:16.328 --> 01:53:18.261
You cool
motherfuckers out there,

01:53:18.263 --> 01:53:19.662
all of yous, what
we need for y'all

01:53:19.664 --> 01:53:21.197
to fuckin' do is tell everybody

01:53:21.199 --> 01:53:22.632
about this motherfucking movie.

01:53:22.634 --> 01:53:24.601
Get on the Facebook,
the Twitter.

01:53:24.603 --> 01:53:25.736
That's the like.

01:53:25.738 --> 01:53:26.569
Shit, the Facebook, the Twitter,

01:53:26.571 --> 01:53:27.637
whatever the fuck
it is you're on.

01:53:27.639 --> 01:53:29.572
- The Instagram.
- Yes!

01:53:29.574 --> 01:53:30.708
What's those other ones?

01:53:30.710 --> 01:53:32.141
Facebook?

01:53:32.143 --> 01:53:33.610
We said that one
already, didn't we?

01:53:33.612 --> 01:53:35.345
Instagram.

01:53:35.347 --> 01:53:36.579
We said that, too.

01:53:36.581 --> 01:53:37.480
Anyway, get on all
the fuckin' formats

01:53:37.482 --> 01:53:39.650
and whatever format
comes out at the time

01:53:39.652 --> 01:53:41.551
and tell them about this
movie, Cherokee Creek

01:53:41.553 --> 01:53:44.722
because we're a 100
percent independent film

01:53:44.724 --> 01:53:46.590
and we did not take
shit from nobody.

01:53:46.592 --> 01:53:48.826
And we didn't change
shit in this movie.

01:53:48.828 --> 01:53:51.394
Because we delivered
what we wanna do

01:53:51.396 --> 01:53:52.463
and I know you fucking loved it

01:53:52.465 --> 01:53:54.765
and if you did love it,
the way we fucking love it,

01:53:54.767 --> 01:53:55.866
tell some
motherfuckers about it.

01:53:55.868 --> 01:53:58.602
Hey, we did it the way
we wanted to do it, right?

01:53:58.604 --> 01:54:00.270
We did it the
way we wanted to.

01:54:00.272 --> 01:54:01.204
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:54:01.206 --> 01:54:02.740
So fucking tell everybody.

01:54:02.742 --> 01:54:04.207
Tell everybody.

01:54:04.209 --> 01:54:05.709
Hey, don't leave.

01:54:05.711 --> 01:54:06.644
Just stay there and keep an
eye on them motherfuckers.

01:54:06.646 --> 01:54:07.845
What do I do with this?

01:54:07.847 --> 01:54:09.547
Man, hold it at the
camera, make sure they do it.

01:54:09.549 --> 01:54:11.214
- Hey!
- Tell everybody.

01:54:11.216 --> 01:54:13.584
Don't do anything wrong!

01:55:57.324 --> 01:55:58.723
You're not
stealin' my scooter,

01:55:58.725 --> 01:56:00.592
you son of a bitch.

01:56:00.594 --> 01:56:02.594
You're not stealin'
my scooter, you motherfucker!

01:56:02.596 --> 01:56:03.795
Okay, ready?

01:56:03.797 --> 01:56:04.863
Set, looking right
here at my hand, mom.

01:56:04.865 --> 01:56:06.297
You're doing good, don't worry.

01:56:06.299 --> 01:56:07.732
And action!

01:56:07.734 --> 01:56:09.401
You're not
stealin' my scooter,

01:56:09.403 --> 01:56:11.838
you motherfuckin'
son of a bitch.

01:56:13.874 --> 01:56:15.807
Oh boy, guys!

01:56:15.809 --> 01:56:16.808
That's the first time
she got it right.

01:56:16.810 --> 01:56:17.811
Nailed it!

01:56:19.013 --> 01:56:20.280
Alright, come
on, come on, come on.
