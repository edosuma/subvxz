01:03.689 --> 01:09.731
Truly, a labor of love to be able to bring
this magnificent collection to our city...

01:09.903 --> 01:12.941
Where have you been?
They're about to start.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.949
Well, you left your clutch
in the car, babe.

01:16.118 --> 01:19.702
Mr. Greyson Blaise.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.750
Thank you, Phoebe.
You're truly a patron of the arts.

01:26.545 --> 01:30.084
Speaking of patrons of the arts...

01:30.257 --> 01:31.338
...Napoleon.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.544
His first wife couldn't bear him a child,
so he dumped the empress of France...

01:35.721 --> 01:38.259
...for the archduchess of Austria.

01:38.432 --> 01:43.223
He got a child and she got a magnificent
gold-and-silver necklace...

01:43.395 --> 01:48.265
...consisting of 234 diamonds,
what is widely considered...

01:48.442 --> 01:51.651
...to be the most spectacular
jewelry piece of the age.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.109
It's here, and on loan
from the Smithsonian.

01:55.407 --> 01:59.447
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's with great pleasure that I give to you...

01:59.620 --> 02:03.364
...the Napoleon diamond necklace.

02:14.551 --> 02:18.261
- Wait a second, what is going on?
- The necklace has been stolen.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.796
I have no idea.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.723
You've been a naughty boy.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.143
You said you had to have it.

02:49.670 --> 02:54.290
Can't believe you're back. I have so many
questions, like where you've been.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.332
I'll tell you later.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.718
But it's done?

03:02.891 --> 03:06.555
- You're back?
- Yeah. I'm never gonna leave you again.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.567
- My foot.
- Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm out of practice.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.773
- It's okay, come here.
- Oh, my God.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.821
When did she get so big?

03:22.994 --> 03:26.487
- Was I really gone that long?
- Oh, it happens fast.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.655
Wait.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.496
- You know what we need?
- To have sex.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.249
We need to get married.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.381
We never got married.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.088
Yeah.

03:40.429 --> 03:41.715
Great.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.722
- First, let's have sex.
- Okay.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.144
Sorry I'm late.
Last night was crazy...

03:54.317 --> 03:56.684
No time.
No more excuses from anybody.

03:56.862 --> 04:01.323
I gotta answer to the DOJ, Panabaker,
and a new FBI director who likes results.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.483
Red's acting like it's vacation.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.118
- I don't wanna make excuses...
- Then don't.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.575
If his contacts are compromised...

04:08.749 --> 04:12.459
I don't buy that for one minute.
The man knows criminals.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.960
He's plugged into
an entire ecosystem of deviants.

04:15.130 --> 04:18.339
I have a hard time believing
he's so compromised he can't help us.

04:18.507 --> 04:22.718
No, he's playing grab-ass by the pool
between naps and happy hour.

04:22.888 --> 04:26.006
- Where you going?
- We are going to find Reddington.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.719
I've had a teenage son.

04:27.893 --> 04:32.183
Best way to handle a man with
no aim in life is to confront him directly.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.560
Myron, I'm in your debt.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.477
A lot of good that'll do
if the boys find out I was here.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.519
Your associates are buzzards.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.281
But you, my friend,
will always be welcome at my table.

04:48.038 --> 04:53.625
This man gets us to a man named
Dennison. He gets us to the suitcase.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.377
Elizabeth, Mr. Cooper.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.255
Harold, Elizabeth, please sit.
Have a <i>siu mai.</i>

05:00.425 --> 05:02.508
Is there somewhere we can talk?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.043
Greyson Blaise.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.510
- Your room, an office?
- I'm giving you a Blacklister.

05:07.682 --> 05:11.722
Or are you here to play ColorKu?
An absolutely infuriating game.

05:11.895 --> 05:15.309
- Although, I do love the way it looks.
- Greyson Blaise?

05:15.482 --> 05:18.646
Didn't he circumnavigate
the globe in a balloon?

05:18.819 --> 05:22.529
And raced at Le Mans
and trekked across the Sahara...

05:22.697 --> 05:27.237
...and stole van Gogh's <i>Poppy Flowers</i>
from a museum in Cairo.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.491
He's an art thief.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.827
A thrill seeker.
A van Gogh in Cairo, a Picasso in Rio...

05:32.999 --> 05:37.039
<i>...and last night in New York,
a necklace. The Napoleon necklace.</i>

05:37.212 --> 05:39.204
Blaise is a rising star...

05:39.381 --> 05:43.546
...and he's using dark money
in politics to spread his influence...

05:43.718 --> 05:48.679
...buying loyalty for the day when the
next thrill ride he chooses to go on...

05:48.849 --> 05:51.762
...is to run for something.
King, perhaps.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.392
So how do we get to him?

05:53.562 --> 05:56.555
There's an auction in Zagreb
36 hours from now.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.518
I'm told Blaise will be there.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.185
Taking down someone with
Blaise's profile is what we need.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.944
Unfortunately for you...

06:04.114 --> 06:07.323
...I'm not telling you about Blaise
so you can take him down.

06:07.534 --> 06:11.949
I'm telling you about him so you can
help me go into business with him.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.456
- Why would I help you do that?
- You need a powerful CI.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.082
Someone people fear.

06:17.252 --> 06:21.872
And if my world learns I'm aligned with
Blaise, people will be terrified.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.337
Blaise won't align with you
if he knows you're broke.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.678
Which is why
we must convince him that I'm not.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.011
Fine. But you're not going to
that auction alone.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.517
Keen, Ressler, Navabi are going.
I don't want arguments.

06:35.687 --> 06:40.307
Who's arguing?
I need a ride, you've got a jet.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.283
What the...?

06:52.829 --> 06:57.494
- We're closed. How'd you get in here?
- We need to talk.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.541
Okay. Give me the rundown.
What do we know?

07:06.718 --> 07:10.211
Not much, and according
to Reddington, that is the appeal.

07:10.388 --> 07:13.927
Apparently, it's an upscale affair
run by Juric and Bauer...

07:14.100 --> 07:16.934
...the auction house
hosting the event in Zagreb.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.596
According to their website,
their auction features exotic...

07:20.774 --> 07:23.016
...coins, stamps, decorative arts.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.903
- One-percenters are gonna be all over it.
- Which means security.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.485
The company uses
a system to log guests.

07:29.658 --> 07:34.494
I was able to locate their servers
and add a new profile.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.032
Lovely. Who am I gonna be this time?

07:39.209 --> 07:43.123
<i>Yasmin Shahidi. The daughter
of an Iranian textile manufacturer...</i>

07:43.296 --> 07:46.505
<i>...who made a fortune
selling estates in Beverly Hills.</i>

07:46.675 --> 07:49.918
What about Reddington?
Risky to bring him in the front.

07:50.095 --> 07:54.681
- Once you're in, find an alternate entry.
- South stairwell, 30 seconds.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.776
Nice work.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.656
All right, look, but don't touch. Or bid.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.695
I know the rules, Donald.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.036
Well, humor us and try to follow them.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.621
This is fun.
Out and about, a glass of bubbles.

08:26.798 --> 08:31.133
Try to keep a low profile. Last thing
we need is someone to recognize you.

08:31.302 --> 08:36.592
Truth be told, being stuck stateside
has left me feeling smothered as of late.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.929
Oh, my goodness,
look at those Guan vases.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.434
And that flatware.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.018
Did you know Nancy Reagan,
she could dress a table...

08:45.191 --> 08:49.026
...specifically for that night's guests
at a moment's notice?

08:49.195 --> 08:52.984
Russian silver for a tea
with Gorbachev...

08:53.158 --> 08:58.779
...Italian silver stag-head stirrup cups
for a last-minute supper with Sinatra.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.073
- Can you imagine?
- Sinatra? I can't imagine.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.084
Let's find a paddle card
and a catalog.

09:05.253 --> 09:10.214
I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy
dickering over an heirloom now and then.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.252
Just finished my shift.
I'll be home in 31 minutes.

09:14.429 --> 09:17.172
Yep, I use Waze to find my way home.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.841
Don't let the scrubs fool you,
you're engaged to a moron.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.594
I'll be home soon.

09:26.357 --> 09:30.567
- Whatever it is, the answer is no.
- Two minutes, okay? Less.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.569
Please.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.573
We move on, then, to lot 348.
Might I remind you...

09:36.743 --> 09:38.655
- ...this collection...
- I don't see him.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.945
...bronze cent from each mint...

09:41.122 --> 09:44.957
...including the unique
1943-D bronze penny...

09:45.126 --> 09:48.494
...which PCGS has certified
at 68 out of 70.

09:48.671 --> 09:52.506
Shall we open the bidding, then,
at $1.8 million?

09:52.675 --> 09:56.168
- Did you hear me? He isn't here.
- One-point-eight million.

09:56.346 --> 09:59.214
- What are you doing? You insane?
- I can't resist.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.428
We're at an auction.
I have to bid on something.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.184
You don't have any money.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.062
Harold does. It's important
for me to keep up appearances.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.566
- Can't look like a party pooper.
- Two-point-four million.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.603
Anything under 3
for the bronze Lincoln penny...

10:13.780 --> 10:16.443
- ...is highway robbery.
- Knock it off.

10:16.991 --> 10:20.075
We are through, at 2.4 million.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.362
- Three.
- Three million dollars.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.906
Gentleman's bid now at 3 million.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.999
Sold to you, sir, at $3 million.
Paddle 143.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.465
Well, at least we got his attention.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.305
Reddington's her father?
Can't say I'm surprised.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.182
Sad for her.
What does this have to do with me?

10:44.352 --> 10:47.095
Nothing.
That mystery has been solved.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.808
But this one hasn't.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.984
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.363
- That's why I'm here.
- Can't help you.

10:57.532 --> 11:01.776
Whoever's in here, this is the dying wish
of a good woman. Kaplan died...

11:01.953 --> 11:06.118
...so Liz could find this skeleton
and identify the remains.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.457
Liz is FBI. Why can't she ID them?

11:09.627 --> 11:12.870
- She doesn't know about them.
- Your two minutes are up.

11:13.047 --> 11:16.711
I tell her, she'll tell Reddington.
If he finds out before we...

11:16.885 --> 11:18.626
- We?
- He'll find a way to make sure...

11:18.803 --> 11:21.090
- ...she never learns the truth.
- There's no we.

11:21.264 --> 11:25.804
Last time I helped you guys keep
a secret from him, he almost killed me.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.848
I get it.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.312
Kaplan didn't leave instructions?

11:30.481 --> 11:33.474
Just a number to call
when I picked up the suitcase.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.689
She has a confederate.
Maybe he has the answers.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.196
I was hoping to get them from you.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.108
I really should go.

11:46.581 --> 11:49.449
Ladies, gentlemen,
we come to our next item up for bid.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.370
- A lovely work of craftsmanship...
- Raymond Reddington.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.505
- I didn't know you were a collector.
- Yes.

11:56.674 --> 12:02.045
But 3 million for a book of coins
is a bit rich even for my blood.

12:02.847 --> 12:05.715
Sorry, I don't believe
we've had the pleasure. Greyson Blaise.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.384
- Colleen Williams.
- Anna Cartwright.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.346
I'm surprised to see you here,
Raymond. I heard you were struggling.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.185
If you're struggling, you're alive.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.978
They say that your associate,
the woman, she tried to destroy you.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.191
Anna, those are lovely earrings.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.904
They were a gift from Greyson.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.693
Cheers.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.455
Those are just exquisite.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.661
- May I?
- Yeah.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.460
Rumor has it
you may be in the mood to...

12:35.630 --> 12:39.294
...unload a certain waterway
in the Aegean Sea.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.427
I suspect you know surprisingly little
about my business dealings.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.635
Perhaps. Or perhaps
there's a leak in the boat, Greyson.

12:46.808 --> 12:51.098
One we'd need to plug
before hopping into the canoe together.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.017
I shouldn't be seen with you here.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.649
Yet you understand
running an enterprise such as mine...

12:57.819 --> 13:02.689
...requires a network of trade routes
which could prove quite profitable...

13:02.865 --> 13:05.152
...to a man with your resources.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.693
Go on.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.040
I...

13:13.209 --> 13:16.122
I don't know
where Dennison is. Honestly.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.457
I'd tell you if I did.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.010
Do you like carrots?

13:25.179 --> 13:27.045
Yeah, sure. Why?

13:28.850 --> 13:29.886
Good.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.519
Are you making us a meal?

13:53.041 --> 13:54.373
Pasta.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.299
We should give thanks.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.677
All praise is due to Allah,
who give us food and drink...

14:12.226 --> 14:16.186
...and whose wisdom may guide us
toward a resolution of our conflict...

14:16.356 --> 14:20.145
...that doesn't involve hospitalization.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.569
This is how you get me
to tell you where to find Dennison?

14:24.739 --> 14:28.904
I believe one gets more flies
with honey than vinegar.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.036
I have also studied
the Behavioral Change Stairway Model...

14:33.206 --> 14:37.120
...developed by the FBI's
hostage-negotiation unit.

14:38.294 --> 14:43.039
If the goal is to get one
to tell something they don't want to tell...

14:43.466 --> 14:46.755
...empathy and rapport are vital.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.927
This tastes amazing.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.806
Red or white?

15:01.359 --> 15:03.066
Red, please.

15:16.207 --> 15:18.824
To finding Mr. Dennison.

15:20.628 --> 15:24.087
What am I thinking? This isn't the time
nor the place to talk business.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.250
- Let's go have a drink.
- I don't think so, it's getting late.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.295
- A nightcap. Amaro, perhaps?
- Anna. I have an early morning.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.431
Well, if you change your mind or care
to see the Rembrandt, give me a call.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.892
Wait. The Rembrandt?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.937
<i>Storm on the Sea of Galilee.</i>

15:41.566 --> 15:43.603
That's been missing
for nearly 30 years.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.144
Missing? The thing's hanging
on the wall of my house on Lake Como.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.530
That's it.
I don't know why I didn't think of it earlier.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.784
We're having a get-together at the house.
You should come.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.535
You have a house on Lake Como?

15:55.705 --> 15:58.618
That's not far from me.
Why didn't I know that?

15:58.791 --> 16:03.126
It's a fairly recent acquisition,
papered, of course, to ensure my privacy.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.789
I'm throwing a birthday party
for a friend. Drinks in the garden.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.502
We can talk a little shop...

16:08.676 --> 16:12.386
...and you can experience
<i>Sea of Galilee</i> in the flesh.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.842
I'm busy Saturday.

16:15.433 --> 16:19.143
But if my plans change,
I might try and swing by.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.138
For the Rembrandt.

16:22.607 --> 16:23.848
Cheers, Raymond.

16:27.111 --> 16:30.946
I thought you were broke. I didn't know
you had a house on Lake Como.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.357
- I don't.
- Why tell him you're throwing a party?

16:33.534 --> 16:37.494
It was the first thing that came to mind.
I hope Harold's still in the office.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.700
- Can you call him?
- And say what?

16:39.874 --> 16:42.992
That we need his checkbook.
We're throwing a party.

16:48.090 --> 16:52.551
You want the FBI to throw you a party?
Why on earth would I agree to that?

16:52.720 --> 16:55.463
Because I told Greyson Blaise
I was throwing a party.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.259
I'm sorry, I'm just so confused, Harold.
Do you not like parties?

17:00.186 --> 17:03.520
Why did you promise Blaise
a painting you don't own...

17:03.689 --> 17:07.182
...at a party you're not throwing,
at a home you don't have?

17:07.359 --> 17:08.692
I had to say something.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.568
<i>What if Blaise doesn't show?</i>

17:10.738 --> 17:13.230
He's an art collector
who has an opportunity to see...

17:13.406 --> 17:17.070
...a magnificent painting
that's been missing for 27 years.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.234
He'll show.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.450
The FBI isn't in the business
of throwing criminals parties.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.616
Let me worry about the house
and the party.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.160
I only need your assistance
acquiring the painting.

17:26.337 --> 17:29.580
<i>The Sea of Galilee</i> was stolen in 1990.
No one has seen it since.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.501
Amalia Hammett sees it every day.
It's sitting on an easel in the living room...

17:33.678 --> 17:36.466
- ...of her apartment in Paris.
- How do you know that?

17:36.639 --> 17:39.723
- I brokered the sale.
- You want us to steal it back.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.885
The woman is in possession
of a stolen work of art.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.724
The FBI can't seize it in Europe.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.981
While you could request
a joint operation with the French...

17:48.150 --> 17:52.144
...I'm not sure they'll let you
lend it to my estate on Lake Como.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.564
So, yes, you should steal it.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.242
- Hey, Navabi, you got eyes?
- Not yet, any minute.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.998
Aram says her calendar indicates
that she and Marius...

18:05.167 --> 18:08.035
...have a manicure
every Thursday at 11.

18:08.212 --> 18:12.297
<i>He sounds like a real heartthrob.
Who is this guy, her boyfriend?</i>

18:13.217 --> 18:15.550
More like her bitch. I'm on the move.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.636
You gotta be kidding me.

18:27.273 --> 18:30.937
Speaking of loyal companions,
how are things with you and Aram?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.022
Lovely. Thank you for asking.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.649
- You and I got a problem.
- I'm touched. You're jealous.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.443
Not quite. The old lady's coming back
with her hamster.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.077
Painting's not
where he said it would be.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.334
- What are you talking about?
<i>- The Sea of Galilee</i>, it's gone.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.039
<i>Well, Hammett's on her way up.</i>

18:58.888 --> 19:02.256
I'm so sorry. Do you speak English?
I just need some directions.

19:02.433 --> 19:05.892
I'm sorry, young man, I'm very late.

19:08.064 --> 19:12.274
All right, Navabi, you gotta go.
She's on her way up. Now.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.069
- The Rembrandt, where is it?
- What are you doing in my flat?

19:20.242 --> 19:23.826
I have no earthly idea
what you're talking about. Out.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.205
Get out. I'm calling the police.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.037
You're not calling anyone.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.644
It's amazing.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.181
How'd you convince the owner
to let you use it?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.315
I haven't, but I will.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.028
Sometimes being notorious
has its perks.

20:02.034 --> 20:07.280
I know I've thrown a lot at you,
so please, take time to discuss.

20:07.832 --> 20:11.200
So you want to take our house.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.289
Not take. Borrow.

20:14.171 --> 20:18.882
He wants to have a party.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.002
I understand,
but you do know who he is?

20:22.179 --> 20:25.763
- The cowboy, the American...
- He's a criminal, not a cowboy...

20:25.933 --> 20:28.425
...and I don't see
what other choice we have...

20:28.936 --> 20:30.518
We'll let you two talk.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.396
Maybe you could
just rent a different house.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.653
One doesn't simply rent
the kind of estate...

20:39.822 --> 20:43.486
...I would have on Lake Como.
Besides, I told Blaise we had a garden.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.446
They'll come around.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.031
No.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.868
- What?
- My husband, Paolo, he says no.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.583
Analia, who plays the piano?

20:53.753 --> 20:54.994
Paolo.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.674
Please tell Paolo
he's hosting a party tomorrow afternoon.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.756
He can either drink champagne
and tickle the ivories...

21:03.929 --> 21:06.797
...or spend the rest of the night
locked in the wine cellar.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.187
What kind of music would you like?

21:25.993 --> 21:27.950
We know you bought
<i>The Sea of Galilee.</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:30.112
That Reddington brokered the sale.

21:30.289 --> 21:34.454
- You either tell us where it is or I...
- Or what? Who are you, anyway?

21:34.627 --> 21:38.120
You're not French police,
you have no right to come into my home.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.334
You're right.
We have no right to be here...

21:40.508 --> 21:43.592
...which should tell you we're
serious people with a need...

21:43.761 --> 21:46.094
...for the information
that we are requesting.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.129
Since we're willing to break in...

21:48.724 --> 21:51.432
...no telling what we'd be willing
to do to you or Marius.

21:51.602 --> 21:54.720
- How did you know my dog's name?
- Where is the painting?

21:55.272 --> 21:58.265
- What do you mean, she sold it?
- Out of the country.

21:58.442 --> 22:02.106
Backstabbing old bird. She promised if
she decided to let that painting go...

22:02.279 --> 22:05.989
...she'd allow me to broker the sale.
Donald, we need that painting.

22:06.158 --> 22:10.619
It's not here and we can't get it,
so I hope you have a plan B.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.529
I'm out of the game.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.870
Dale, hear me out.
I'll double your highest fee.

22:16.043 --> 22:22.256
Raymond, I like you, I do,
but this isn't about the money.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.545
The thrill is gone.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.963
Right.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.175
You know what, never mind.
It would've been impossible.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.721
- What's impossible?
- No, I get it. I'll go.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.556
What are you trying to duplicate?

22:35.729 --> 22:37.265
<i>Galilee.</i>

22:37.439 --> 22:38.805
Impossible.

22:39.692 --> 22:43.356
Nobody can re-create Rembrandt.
You'd have to be a fool to try.

22:44.154 --> 22:47.898
Forget I asked. It was a mistake.
You're on to other things.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.032
How long until you need it?

22:50.202 --> 22:52.285
Twenty-four hours.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.072
You'll have it in 20.

23:12.808 --> 23:16.222
Christoforo. Hello, old friend.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.977
Yes, a party.

23:18.689 --> 23:22.182
Yes, yes. Why would I not invite you?

23:23.444 --> 23:26.687
No, no. Where are you?

23:28.657 --> 23:33.027
Yes, a party. Yes, yes. No, no, no.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.616
No, no, bring Basillo and his wife.

23:35.789 --> 23:39.373
No, no, no. Yes, and the sister too.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.788
Yes.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.792
- You look nice.
- Thank you. You look...

23:50.054 --> 23:51.090
What is that?

23:51.263 --> 23:54.347
I only brought one suit.
I had to borrow something from Paolo.

23:54.516 --> 23:58.385
What color is that, pumpkin?
It looks like a pumpkin.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.679
His wife says it's Tuscan Sunset.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.567
- Where's Ressler?
- On his way.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.273
More than I can say for Blaise.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.985
According to the tracker,
they're still at their house.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.650
Yes, the tracker. About that.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.570
The men just finished
a security sweep.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.408
They found this.

24:24.922 --> 24:28.040
What do you mean, you intended
for the tracking device to be found?

24:28.217 --> 24:31.005
To gain his trust.
I told Blaise he had a mole.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.135
The tracking device confirms it.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.139
- Reporting what? I don't...
- Get her out.

24:37.017 --> 24:42.137
No, Greyson, baby, please.
Greyson. Get off. Greyson!

24:42.314 --> 24:44.180
Anna Cartwright is not a spy.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.350
No, she's a con artist and a thief.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.565
But she's innocent of this.
By framing her, she could be killed.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.196
She won't be killed.
She'll be banished.

24:52.741 --> 24:58.282
To rebuild, I need Blaise,
and to get to him, I need his trust.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.321
Where the bloody hell is Ressler?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.286
How'd you know about Anna?

25:02.459 --> 25:03.825
I didn't.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.998
Raymond Reddington did.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.459
Perhaps I should attend
his little party after all.

25:17.558 --> 25:20.642
Okay. The good news
is Ressler is en route...

25:20.811 --> 25:23.053
...and the painting will be here
in 20 minutes.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.597
- And the bad news?
- Blaise just walked in.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.265
Of course he did.

25:30.446 --> 25:32.187
Greyson. Welcome.

25:32.364 --> 25:36.108
Raymond. It seems rumors of
your demise have been exaggerated.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.119
Fake news. The curse of our times.

25:39.705 --> 25:40.946
So where's this painting?

25:41.123 --> 25:43.536
I have absolutely no idea.

25:43.709 --> 25:47.419
So many rooms,
so many masterpieces. Let's wander.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.376
I'm sure we'll stumble
upon it eventually.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.040
Cheers.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.928
Welcome to Geo, can I help you?

26:02.311 --> 26:05.395
Yeah, I just need to change the...

26:05.731 --> 26:09.065
- ...billing address on my account.
- Sure, I can help you with that.

26:09.485 --> 26:11.693
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.103
Let me get your number.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.818
It's 202-555-0105.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.158
Mr. Dennison?

26:19.328 --> 26:24.073
You don't have to call me mister.
I'm sorry, man. My wife just left me.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.866
Oh, no, no. That's fine...

26:27.044 --> 26:28.876
...Albert. No worries.

26:29.046 --> 26:32.835
I'll get that billing address changed.
Let me get the last four of your social.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.170
Seven years we've been together,
you know?

26:35.344 --> 26:37.336
- Sorry.
- And she's sleeping with her boss.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.049
- What?
- Now I have to move out.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.340
I found that apartment,
I remodeled it myself.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.806
Now I'm sleeping on my buddy's couch.
She's banging a guy named Phil.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.891
- That's messed up.
- The guy wears a bowling shirt.

26:48.065 --> 26:51.433
The kind with his nickname
embroidered on the front.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.351
And it's "Chesty," all right?

26:53.529 --> 26:56.317
She picked a guy
named Chesty over me.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.857
If I could get that new address
for the bill...

26:59.034 --> 27:03.529
- ...I'll fix you right up.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's 618 Hillgrove.

27:04.748 --> 27:05.829
Great.

27:05.999 --> 27:10.744
You want me to discontinue the copy
being sent to the Kinsey Street address?

27:10.921 --> 27:13.880
That's fine.
I don't even get it. I just pay it online.

27:14.049 --> 27:19.636
No, says here you still get a copy
sent to 319 Kinsey Street.

27:21.181 --> 27:24.094
I'd be a completely silent partner.

27:24.268 --> 27:27.136
Harold Lloyd hanging
from the clock tower.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.055
Risking all, saying nothing.

27:30.232 --> 27:31.598
It's an interesting proposal.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.892
My goods run through your ports.

27:34.069 --> 27:38.780
If I'm caught, you disavow.
If I'm not, you get 5 percent of the profits.

27:38.949 --> 27:42.283
Ten percent and you have a deal.
If you show me the painting.

27:42.452 --> 27:43.488
Yes.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.121
It looks even better if you have
a glass of champagne in your hand.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.827
Where is that young girl?

27:49.585 --> 27:52.168
Don't move a muscle.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.084
- Finally.
- Apparently, genius can't be rushed.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.843
Careful! It's still wet.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.847
There's an entrance on the south side
leading into the study.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.676
Analia, just in the nick of time.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.767
No, enough with the champagne.
And the stalling.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.023
Do you have the painting or not?

28:15.861 --> 28:18.103
As a matter of fact, I don't.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.691
Truth be told, I'm broke.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.609
I knew it. And this,
all of this, the estate?

28:23.785 --> 28:25.993
- Belongs to Analia here.
- The caterer.

28:26.163 --> 28:28.325
And the pianist, Paolo.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.410
They lent it to me under duress.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.250
Is that true?

28:39.760 --> 28:42.548
- Leaving so soon?
- Sugar, it can't be soon enough.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.054
But you haven't seen the painting yet.

28:50.103 --> 28:53.187
- What's this?
- Well, we were just taking it down to...

28:53.357 --> 28:55.519
Don't understand,
you said you didn't have it.

28:55.692 --> 28:58.935
I don't. You do.
That's why my men were taking it down.

28:59.112 --> 29:02.526
A gift to commemorate
our new partnership.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.699
It's beautiful.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.334
So much more vivid
than any photograph.

29:15.504 --> 29:19.714
The colors jump out, almost as if
the oils on the canvas were still wet.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.127
Dale has spent
two long years restoring it.

29:23.303 --> 29:24.419
And now it's yours.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.054
I'm sorry, but I couldn't.

29:27.224 --> 29:31.844
You could, and you will.
Wrap it up and load it into his vehicle.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.057
- I don't know what to say.
- Go. Enjoy.

29:37.234 --> 29:40.818
We'll talk tomorrow,
set things in motion.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.274
Thank you, Raymond.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.494
I can't believe it worked.

29:51.665 --> 29:52.906
Almost.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.788
Inspector Scutari.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.706
Yes, hello. I'm calling
about the stolen painting.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.498
<i>Si</i>, the Rembrandt.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.550
He did what?

30:12.728 --> 30:14.390
<i>It worked. The entire plan.</i>

30:14.563 --> 30:18.853
Blaise agreed to align with Red, then Red
turned him in to the Italian police.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.608
Apparently it was pre-planned.

30:20.777 --> 30:24.191
There was an art-crime inspector
waiting for Reddington's call.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.525
Sir, are you seeing this?

30:34.541 --> 30:37.534
<i>So Mr. Reddington gave the forgery
to Blaise as a gift...</i>

30:37.711 --> 30:39.373
<i>...then set him up to get arrested?</i>

30:39.546 --> 30:41.788
This makes no sense.
The reason to go there...

30:41.965 --> 30:44.332
...was to convince Blaise
to do business with Red.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.717
So he played us. But why?

30:46.887 --> 30:50.255
I told you, the reason we're here
is to rebuild my empire.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.889
By partnering with Blaise.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.517
By getting him to vouch
for your financial situation.

30:54.686 --> 30:59.351
That is a lily I may have gilded.
But it's a lovely evening on Lake Como.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.608
Let's not spoil it
picking the sense from the nonsense.

31:02.778 --> 31:03.985
Where are you going?

31:04.154 --> 31:06.692
Blaise's mansion
is about 15 minutes from here...

31:06.865 --> 31:11.360
...and inside it is the cornerstone
on which I can begin to rebuild.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.279
Are you telling me
that this entire thing...

31:14.456 --> 31:17.824
...the forgery, the mansion,
the 150 bottles of wine...

31:18.001 --> 31:21.494
...and Blaise's arrest,
were all an extremely expensive...

31:21.671 --> 31:24.914
...and elaborate ruse
so that you could rob him?

31:25.884 --> 31:26.874
Yes.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.755
Cool.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.887
- Cool?
- Maybe the wine.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.050
Or the fact that I have
no legal jurisdiction in Italy.

31:35.227 --> 31:40.347
Or that Blaise called me "sugar" earlier,
but, yeah, I think it's really cool.

31:51.785 --> 31:53.026
Help you with something?

31:53.203 --> 31:55.160
Why aren't you destroying everything?

31:55.330 --> 31:56.866
Destroy, I'm sorry, who are...?

31:57.040 --> 31:59.532
We're on the brink
of a level-four breach.

31:59.709 --> 32:03.498
- What's your name?
- Caden Gard, chief international counsel.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.129
I got some attorney out here.

32:05.298 --> 32:08.712
I'm here because Blaise has been
arrested less than 20 minutes ago.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.844
Within another 20,
this place'll be crawling with Carabinieri.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.596
I called ahead,
gave explicit instructions...

32:14.766 --> 32:18.259
- ...everything was to be destroyed.
- We just got a tip from Interpol...

32:18.437 --> 32:20.520
Blaise was arrested.
Why am I standing here?

32:20.689 --> 32:24.433
Miss Chloe and I are only here because
this is a single-scope SCI sweep.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.727
- I don't know what that is.
- Oh, my God. Where is Peniford?

32:27.946 --> 32:28.982
Peniford?

32:29.156 --> 32:30.943
All right, radio your team. Everyone.

32:31.116 --> 32:34.029
Tell them I'm on site
and we're at tier three, okay?

32:34.202 --> 32:37.741
Miss Chloe, contact our man at Interpol.
Find out how much time we have.

32:37.914 --> 32:42.249
If anyone shows up,
the alert word is pumpkin. You, inside.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.332
We're tier three.

32:45.505 --> 32:50.125
Cell phones, pagers, anything with a chip
needs to go in the microwave.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.919
Egidio says police
are on their way, 15 minutes or less.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.883
You. Can you access
the security feeds?

32:55.056 --> 32:56.297
- Yes, sir.
- Destroy them.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.933
Okay, people, listen up.
Sugarfoot has been arrested.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.139
Time is of the essence.
We're tier three...

33:01.313 --> 33:03.680
...but we prepared for this.
You know the protocol.

33:03.857 --> 33:06.144
This is now officially
a single-scope operation.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.435
You and you, find anything
with a hard drive.

33:08.862 --> 33:11.570
Get it in the bathtub.
You two, you're on paperwork.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.902
Anything with numbers gets burned.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.113
Show Miss Chloe the financials.
You, show me Yankee Bob White.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.155
- Sir?
- The safe. Where's the safe?

33:21.833 --> 33:25.201
Oh, my God. He's keeping financials
on the entire staff.

33:25.378 --> 33:29.042
This could implicate all of us.
Take it downstairs and burn it.

33:29.216 --> 33:32.129
You, get me the combination
to that safe.

33:32.302 --> 33:33.668
Take these.

33:35.722 --> 33:39.341
Before we get killed, do you mind
telling me what we're looking for?

33:40.143 --> 33:42.385
Blaise's passports.
Find them, shred them.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.266
Miss Chloe? Time.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.396
Six minutes and counting.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.190
Some of the records are on paper.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.693
But he keeps important docs
on this thumb drive.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.854
The passports. Go, now.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.403
What about the painting? <i>Dance?</i>

33:56.576 --> 33:58.659
- The Picasso?
- Get it out of here. Anywhere.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.990
Have them put it in my car.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.543
- Take it. Take it.
- What?

34:11.007 --> 34:14.295
The Lincoln Penny?
That's what we're here to steal? A coin.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.047
Do you have the thumb drive?

34:23.103 --> 34:26.847
Threw both of Mr. Blaise's desktops
in the lake.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.187
The police may find them,
but the drives are toast.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.272
Listen to me.
Good God, man, listen.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.858
If you make it out,
there's a hotel in Paris...

34:35.031 --> 34:39.025
- ...3241 Rue de la Mare, say it back.
- 3241 Rue de la Mare.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.819
Go there. Get a room
under the name Mr. DeLacey. Say it!

34:41.996 --> 34:44.739
- Mr. DeLacey.
- Right. I'll make contact when it's safe.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.454
Until then, talk to no one.
Do you understand?

34:47.627 --> 34:49.664
Good luck, mate. And godspeed.

34:52.841 --> 34:56.585
- Is that really a Picasso in the back seat?
- Yes. That was a nice surprise.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.397
Harold, you're obviously upset.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.685
No, I'm not upset.
"Upset" is an emotional word.

35:13.862 --> 35:17.026
My reaction isn't about emotion,
it's about my job.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.440
It's about you keeping me in the dark.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.201
Refusing to respect my role
as head of this task force.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.952
You know what else it's about?

35:24.122 --> 35:27.456
Your ego and your obvious failure
to understand that this operation...

35:27.626 --> 35:29.868
...everything we do,
is hanging by a thread.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.411
I thought you might be upset.

35:31.588 --> 35:35.377
Lured us in. Acted like the only thing
you needed was a ride to that auction.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.963
Next thing I know,
my people are stealing paintings.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.550
To be fair,
stealing back a painting. Or...

35:41.723 --> 35:42.713
...trying, at least.

35:42.891 --> 35:46.760
Not to mention, half a dozen invoices
for a party at a house on Lake Como.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.061
Right.

35:49.397 --> 35:54.188
Please don't forget to pay the catering bill.
Those folks were very, very nice.

35:54.361 --> 35:57.149
After all that, what do we have
to show for it? Nothing.

35:57.322 --> 36:01.157
You handed Blaise over to the
Italian police. We don't get credit.

36:01.326 --> 36:07.118
True, the Italians will get credit for
arresting Blaise with <i>The Sea of Galilee.</i>

36:07.290 --> 36:11.580
Of course, it's not <i>The Sea of Galilee,</i>
which they will realize...

36:11.753 --> 36:15.793
...at which point they'll be forced
to release Blaise with apologies.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.548
- So nobody gets him.
- Wrong. You get him.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.675
You and this task force.

36:20.845 --> 36:24.509
Because while the Carabinieri
have bogus evidence...

36:24.683 --> 36:28.222
...you have the genuine article.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.684
Fast, hard proof
of Blaise's criminal activities...

36:31.856 --> 36:33.643
...all over the globe.

36:33.817 --> 36:36.776
Art heists. Missing masterpieces.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.528
That necklace alone
should be enough to put him away...

36:40.115 --> 36:46.407
...and get your new director off your back
for a long weekend, at least.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.618
What was in that house
that was so important?

36:58.883 --> 37:01.045
Penny for your thoughts.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.136
Why'd you do it?

37:05.932 --> 37:07.844
Why'd you let me?

37:08.268 --> 37:10.180
Wasn't the wine.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.226
I'm scared of you.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.360
Now more than ever.

37:19.904 --> 37:23.443
Of who you are, because...

37:24.784 --> 37:27.026
...it might be who I am too.

37:28.621 --> 37:32.240
I let you do it because it felt
like the right thing to do.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.159
It wasn't.

37:35.628 --> 37:39.121
But it certainly felt that way because...

37:39.340 --> 37:41.423
Because you're my daughter?

37:49.934 --> 37:52.847
In more ways than I care to admit.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.165
Are you Dennison?

38:27.514 --> 38:29.551
Who did this to you?

38:30.183 --> 38:33.517
What happened?
You okay? Who did this to you?

38:37.690 --> 38:39.056
I'm sorry.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.241
Albert.

38:57.043 --> 39:00.002
Albert. Look at me.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.459
Do you know who I am?

39:10.098 --> 39:12.556
You're a tough son of a bitch.

39:20.149 --> 39:23.438
Your loyalty to Kate is admirable.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.106
But you will die, Albert.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.868
Here and now,
if you don't tell me where that suitcase is.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.830
Who has it?

39:39.669 --> 39:41.251
I won't ask you again.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.785
Hey, hey,
why did I pick up the suitcase?

40:14.954 --> 40:17.446
- O...
- What?

40:19.709 --> 40:20.790
Oleander.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.539
Who's Oleander?

40:24.547 --> 40:25.879
Find him.

40:26.049 --> 40:28.883
Who is that? What is Olea...
What is Oleander?

40:42.398 --> 40:44.435
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>
- Nik, what's up?

40:44.609 --> 40:47.317
I've been thinking about this.
What you said.

40:47.487 --> 40:52.073
I have no interest in getting involved
with Reddington, but if what you said...

40:52.241 --> 40:56.201
If you think Liz is in some kind of danger,
just tell me what you need me to do.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.863
Thank you, Nik, that's...

40:59.958 --> 41:02.701
Thanks. I don't feel comfortable
on the phone. Can we meet?

41:02.877 --> 41:04.413
Yeah. Text me an address.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.211
Smells amazing.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.999
Yeah, well, hold your judgment
until you've tried it.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.088
Because I might end up killing us all.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.251
Us all?

41:14.347 --> 41:15.428
What's going on?

41:23.982 --> 41:25.564
Elizabeth, good evening.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.020
Hello. What's going on?

41:28.569 --> 41:31.027
Tom didn't tell you?
I was invited to dinner.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.359
I set four settings.
Every time I see you...

41:33.533 --> 41:36.367
...you're with Dembe.
I thought the two of you, you know...

41:36.536 --> 41:38.243
I don't know what I thought.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.403
Thank you, Tom.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.243
I regret I can't stay,
I have another engagement.

41:42.417 --> 41:46.252
Sorry to have inconvenienced you,
but at least you'll have plenty of leftovers.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.788
Before I go, let's have a toast.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.749
What exactly are we celebrating?

41:51.926 --> 41:54.293
Tom's return, of course.

41:54.470 --> 41:57.053
Your family must be very happy
to have you back.

41:57.223 --> 42:01.308
I remember warning you
not to embark on that silly adventure.

42:02.061 --> 42:06.226
But nothing ventured, nothing gained.

42:06.399 --> 42:07.435
Welcome home.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.894
Cheers.

42:14.949 --> 42:18.317
So, what have you been up to?
