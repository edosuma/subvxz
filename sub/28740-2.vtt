00:02.053 --> 00:05.097
"Dear respected Christmasland owner,

00:08.141 --> 00:11.727
I am responding to your ad
in Spicy Menace Comic,

00:11.852 --> 00:14.770
Volume 12, Issue 36.

00:18.606 --> 00:22.568
Would I like to work
in Christmasland? You bet!

00:24.986 --> 00:30.365
I have worked 19 years
for MCS Custodial Services.

00:30.490 --> 00:35.535
I am trusted with shipping dangerous
chemical gasses all over the world.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.871
I also work in schools,

00:37.996 --> 00:41.331
where the Vice-Principal says
I'm a go-getter.

00:42.373 --> 00:45.334
There is nothing I'm not ready to do

00:45.460 --> 00:49.378
to earn a place among
your Christmasland staff.

00:49.879 --> 00:51.630
Season's greetings!

00:53.089 --> 00:54.674
Bing Partridge."

01:34.744 --> 01:36.120
Mom?

01:37.246 --> 01:38.288
Dad?

01:51.256 --> 01:52.381
No, no...

01:52.507 --> 01:54.050
No...

02:05.058 --> 02:06.642
Hey, mister...

02:06.767 --> 02:08.393
I have something for you.

02:11.938 --> 02:14.815
It's an invitation to Christmasland.

02:14.940 --> 02:16.565
I knew it!

02:25.989 --> 02:28.366
Are you naughty or are you nice?

02:29.991 --> 02:31.201
Nice.

02:32.744 --> 02:35.746
Only those who truly deserve it
can go to Christmasland.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.514
Vic?

04:01.807 --> 04:03.850
What, you just leave me? No goodbye?

04:05.727 --> 04:06.936
I didn't leave you.

04:07.061 --> 04:09.438
That's what Mom said.
She said you left us both.

04:10.105 --> 04:13.065
Well, then she misunderstood me.

04:14.316 --> 04:16.483
Then help me understand.

04:19.111 --> 04:23.031
Hold up, OK. Let's just...
How did you even find me here?

04:23.781 --> 04:25.824
I shouldn't have had
to find you, Dad.

04:26.783 --> 04:28.910
Chrissy, baby, who is it?

04:31.204 --> 04:32.621
Hold on one second.

04:35.372 --> 04:36.916
You're right.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.334
I should have done this different.

04:40.126 --> 04:43.587
You know, but I...
I had to get out of there.

04:44.004 --> 04:46.422
Your mom and me bring out
the worst in each other.

04:47.006 --> 04:48.883
She's better off without me.

04:52.344 --> 04:53.928
It's for the best.

04:57.138 --> 04:59.224
You should have told me.

05:06.770 --> 05:08.730
I screwed up.

05:10.856 --> 05:11.982
Sorry.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.402
But I am here for you, Brat,
you know?

05:17.027 --> 05:18.654
Anything you need.

05:49.676 --> 05:51.760
It's Tiffany Jones.

05:54.638 --> 05:56.597
I should have known.

06:00.308 --> 06:02.059
Were they drinking?

06:03.269 --> 06:04.687
Yeah.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.690
Maybe when he runs out of beer...

06:09.815 --> 06:13.901
She's a bartender, for Christ's sake.
He's in hog heaven.

06:18.238 --> 06:20.072
I'm going to bed.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.116
Vicky, how did you find out?

07:19.906 --> 07:23.576
Some asshole's been painting dicks
on the loading dock again.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.119
Jeez. I scrubbed them last week.

07:26.244 --> 07:30.080
Yeah. Well, you're going to be
scrubbing them again.

07:33.082 --> 07:34.292
Oh, my God.

07:34.417 --> 07:38.211
Make some fresh coffee, will you?
This stuff tastes like horse piss.

08:09.692 --> 08:10.942
No!

08:42.756 --> 08:43.591
Vic.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.053
Vic?

08:49.136 --> 08:50.429
You alright?

08:50.554 --> 08:52.680
You ride out here
like a bat out of hell,

08:52.806 --> 08:55.100
and now you're, like, in outer space.

09:00.686 --> 09:03.855
What was the name of that filthy doll
you had back in Third Grade?

09:05.399 --> 09:06.565
What?

09:08.692 --> 09:09.776
"Mousey"?

09:11.069 --> 09:13.362
- Or was it "Rabbity"?
- Let's get out of here.

09:13.487 --> 09:16.073
No. "Petey."
The one you had until I lost it.

09:16.198 --> 09:17.407
Are you losing it now?

09:17.532 --> 09:19.283
No, I'm not. What was its name?

09:22.160 --> 09:25.955
It wasn't a doll, it was a rabbit,
and his name was Leonard, so...

09:26.580 --> 09:28.164
If you were going
to bust my balls

09:28.289 --> 09:30.375
we could have done this
where there's weed,

09:30.500 --> 09:32.668
so I could be, you know...

09:32.793 --> 09:35.545
OK. Don't move.

09:36.003 --> 09:37.712
Where you going?

09:37.838 --> 09:41.632
Honestly, I have no fricking idea.

09:44.260 --> 09:45.385
Holy crap!

10:14.781 --> 10:17.116
Craig! Hey.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.201
Hey, you alright?

10:21.119 --> 10:22.828
You alright?

10:31.209 --> 10:32.669
What was that?

10:34.044 --> 10:35.045
What did you see?

10:36.629 --> 10:40.008
- That, Vic. Fricking that.
- Just tell me what you saw.

10:40.132 --> 10:42.801
I saw a bridge, OK? I saw a bridge.
I saw it right there.

10:42.926 --> 10:44.719
And I saw you go over it.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.095
Good.

10:47.721 --> 10:49.347
I tried to follow you and...

10:51.307 --> 10:53.309
Maybe I'm the only one who can cross.

10:58.061 --> 10:59.354
What?

10:59.480 --> 11:00.856
Grab your bike.

11:03.983 --> 11:05.609
Where did it take you?

11:07.777 --> 11:11.529
The first time I went over,
it took me to my father's lost watch.

11:13.156 --> 11:17.534
The second time,
his girlfriend's house.

11:18.659 --> 11:20.453
Just now...

11:22.829 --> 11:24.581
...to a landfill.

11:27.791 --> 11:29.417
Leonard?

11:38.090 --> 11:40.175
- Leonard!
- Yep.

11:40.717 --> 11:42.511
What the hell?

11:42.636 --> 11:45.721
Don't ever cross that thing again.
Alright? For anything.

11:45.846 --> 11:48.640
One day you're finding rabbits,
the next day your dog is dead.

11:48.765 --> 11:50.849
- I don't have a dog.
- OK, then it's you.

11:50.974 --> 11:52.309
Then it's you.

11:52.726 --> 11:54.519
Then it's you instead.

11:57.938 --> 12:00.147
I've never seen you so scared.

12:02.233 --> 12:04.275
Honestly, Vic, I...

12:11.614 --> 12:14.199
I don't know how you're seeing
anything right now.

12:19.537 --> 12:21.371
- Vic...
- Let's get out of here.

12:21.496 --> 12:22.997
Vic?

12:28.209 --> 12:29.752
Let's go.

12:46.806 --> 12:50.934
Could you grab the file
on the Hawkeye Farms case, Nadine?

12:51.059 --> 12:52.351
Thank you.

12:56.354 --> 12:58.940
- Libraries got delivery now?
- Yeah, you wish.

12:59.065 --> 13:01.191
Miss Howard's had you
on a no-lend list

13:01.316 --> 13:03.150
since Pride and Prejudice.

13:03.276 --> 13:04.443
That was six years ago.

13:04.569 --> 13:06.486
- She tried to call the cops.
- She did.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.822
She tried to get me to file
a police report on myself.

13:13.950 --> 13:15.910
Come on, Maggie,
not more Wraith talk.

13:16.035 --> 13:18.495
Listen, there were
only about 500 made.

13:19.079 --> 13:21.080
- Maggie...
- No one really drives them.

13:21.205 --> 13:23.207
They're more like a showpiece,

13:23.332 --> 13:26.084
because once they break
it's hard to find the parts.

13:27.418 --> 13:30.254
You want to go looking
for Wraith parts now?

13:30.379 --> 13:31.296
It's an old car.

13:31.421 --> 13:33.464
Had to have broken down
at some point.

13:33.881 --> 13:37.301
Find the parts, find the Wraith,
and Danny.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.261
Peter Ives didn't take him alone.

13:42.554 --> 13:46.390
According to your... Scrabble bag?

13:52.894 --> 13:54.771
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

13:54.895 --> 13:57.857
- I know you were fond of Danny.
- Am.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.942
I am fond of him.
I taught him how to read.

14:03.319 --> 14:06.696
OK, well, you know,
he's most likely...

14:06.821 --> 14:09.656
There's a junkyard in Nebraska
with spare Wraith parts.

14:11.158 --> 14:12.533
Please.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.592
Young Bing Partridge,
the man of the hour.

14:38.302 --> 14:40.803
We're overdue for a chat, sir.

14:40.928 --> 14:44.723
Probably the most important chat
of your life.

14:45.891 --> 14:47.850
Charles T Manx at your service.

14:47.975 --> 14:49.769
CEO of Christmasland Enterprises,

14:49.894 --> 14:52.562
Director of Christmasland
Entertainment,

14:52.979 --> 14:54.897
President of Fun.

14:57.316 --> 14:59.692
The hand of Fate
has brought us together.

14:59.817 --> 15:02.986
I was on my way here
to locate a certain individual,

15:03.111 --> 15:06.781
an individual able to find
a Shorter Way...

15:08.615 --> 15:11.159
when I received
your inquiry of employment.

15:15.536 --> 15:18.081
You are the author of this missive,
are you not?

15:18.705 --> 15:20.248
Are you offering me a job?

15:20.374 --> 15:25.044
Slow down, Mr Partridge.
I'm interviewing you for a future.

15:25.543 --> 15:28.171
Unless you prefer to spend
your days scrubbing away

15:28.296 --> 15:32.173
at crude depictions
of male galliformes.

15:33.299 --> 15:36.635
- What?
- Cocks, Mr Partridge. Cocks.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.512
I need a new Chief of Security

15:39.637 --> 15:42.597
to protect the children of the world.

15:43.223 --> 15:45.975
You do agree that children need
protection, do you not?

15:47.935 --> 15:49.478
I think so.

15:54.272 --> 15:58.317
Then get in.
Time is wasting, sir.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.027
Thank you.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.585
So Bing, I have been watching you,

16:23.711 --> 16:27.088
and I wonder, in your work
at Sochempharm,

16:27.213 --> 16:31.091
what are the gases
to which you have access?

16:31.507 --> 16:35.009
Oxygen, nitrogen, helium...

16:36.594 --> 16:39.263
Some stuff called sevoflurane.
For dentists mostly.

16:39.388 --> 16:42.014
We call it gingerbread
'cause that's what it smells like.

16:42.140 --> 16:43.891
It's an anesthetic?

16:44.016 --> 16:45.225
Yeah, you huff a little bit,

16:45.350 --> 16:47.436
and kind of do
what people tell you to do.

16:48.978 --> 16:51.355
You become open to suggestion.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.564
Yeah.

16:52.689 --> 16:55.607
Huff too much though,
and it just knocks you out.

16:56.650 --> 16:57.985
I see.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.113
I got to level with you, Mr Manx.

17:02.238 --> 17:06.656
Ever since I wrote you that letter
I've dreamed about Christmasland.

17:07.616 --> 17:09.742
And it was... it was scary.

17:09.867 --> 17:10.952
Scary?

17:11.744 --> 17:15.164
Heavens, no!
What, is hot cocoa scary?

17:15.289 --> 17:18.040
Are presents every day scary?

17:19.040 --> 17:20.250
No.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.669
Not scary like that, but...

17:23.961 --> 17:28.298
Scary, because...
I can't ever get in.

17:28.423 --> 17:33.926
Well, only very special people
ever get in.

17:35.219 --> 17:36.721
Am I special?

17:38.305 --> 17:41.182
That's why I'm looking you over.
To find out.

17:41.849 --> 17:45.059
Tell me, Bing, when you dreamed
about Christmasland,

17:45.810 --> 17:48.228
did the moon wink at you?

17:51.898 --> 17:53.608
How did you know?

17:55.192 --> 17:58.444
Because maybe you do belong
in Christmasland.

17:59.195 --> 18:01.197
I'm so sorry, Mr Manx.

18:01.322 --> 18:04.240
I just... I feel very tired.

18:04.365 --> 18:06.784
I think I'm about to fall asleep.

18:06.909 --> 18:08.160
Good.

18:09.035 --> 18:11.704
The road to Christmasland...

18:12.496 --> 18:14.664
is paved in dreams.

18:25.547 --> 18:27.006
So...

18:29.925 --> 18:31.927
Dad says we're
better off without him.

18:35.137 --> 18:36.721
Maybe we are.

18:37.222 --> 18:40.849
No more handing over the cash
after scrubbing toilets all day.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.769
Maybe you could pick up
an extra client or two.

18:44.894 --> 18:45.728
Yeah?

18:45.853 --> 18:49.940
- Hire somebody to help you out.
- I've been thinking about that.

18:50.606 --> 18:54.317
Have you in the afternoons
and on weekends and...

18:54.734 --> 18:57.528
after you graduate,
well, the sky's the limit.

19:00.405 --> 19:01.572
Vic!

19:02.156 --> 19:04.449
Willa told me
you're applying to RISD.

19:04.866 --> 19:06.785
What a wonderful school.

19:07.952 --> 19:10.871
Yes, we were just talking
about Vic's future.

19:12.163 --> 19:15.040
Well, if you need anything at all,
you let me know.

19:15.165 --> 19:17.668
I have a sorority sister
in the registrar's office.

19:17.793 --> 19:19.460
Thank you, Mrs Brewster.

19:20.294 --> 19:22.170
Everything's bright and shiny!

19:43.435 --> 19:46.729
It's about half as much without
your father's pitchers of beer.

19:46.855 --> 19:48.022
See?

19:55.403 --> 19:57.529
You haven't asked me about RISD.

19:58.446 --> 20:00.114
RISD...

20:02.283 --> 20:03.700
What even is that?

20:05.535 --> 20:08.036
It's the Rhode Island
School of Design.

20:08.662 --> 20:10.496
It's a Fine Arts college. A good one.

20:12.081 --> 20:16.710
It would have been nice to hear it
from you instead of Angela Brewster.

20:16.835 --> 20:18.961
That was embarrassing.

20:22.463 --> 20:23.882
I want to go to college, Mom.

20:24.007 --> 20:26.008
Your father's filling you
with crazy...

20:26.133 --> 20:28.509
- It's not crazy.
- He's the hero, I'm the villain.

20:28.634 --> 20:31.761
You're not. I know you're the one
who kept the family together.

20:31.887 --> 20:34.847
- And a roof over our heads.
- I know. You're the strong one.

20:47.732 --> 20:50.567
I'm worried about Dad
living with a bartender.

20:50.692 --> 20:51.902
Don't be.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.404
It's not your responsibility.

21:53.904 --> 21:57.031
This sucks, Vicky.
Your father's the one that left.

22:00.408 --> 22:02.326
He's better around me.

22:05.620 --> 22:07.163
Sorry, Ma.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.129
Promise me one thing.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.757
If there's hard liquor in...

22:24.550 --> 22:26.301
...in that house,

22:26.426 --> 22:29.179
you come right back home, OK?

22:34.265 --> 22:35.642
Love you.

23:20.340 --> 23:21.924
Not bad.

23:22.049 --> 23:24.051
Mom says I'm too old
to draw with chalk

23:24.176 --> 23:26.803
and that regular girls text
with their friends.

23:28.054 --> 23:30.097
Mine told me the same thing.

23:30.681 --> 23:32.306
Who says we want to be regular?

23:33.349 --> 23:34.892
I want friends.

23:43.732 --> 23:44.899
Vic?

23:47.151 --> 23:50.194
Your dad said you were sick
but you'd be better in a few days.

23:51.195 --> 23:52.946
I am better, thanks to you.

24:06.956 --> 24:08.124
These are yours.

24:08.249 --> 24:10.333
Yeah. I got them
down to size for you.

24:10.876 --> 24:12.836
I wrote my number in the cover.

24:12.961 --> 24:14.211
I already have it.

24:14.336 --> 24:16.589
Good. Call if you need any tips.

24:16.714 --> 24:19.174
Or even if you don't, OK?

24:19.591 --> 24:22.342
- You're leaving?
- I'll be around.

24:22.468 --> 24:25.136
We'll always be friends,
OK, Maggot?

24:26.387 --> 24:27.721
OK, Weasel.

25:20.675 --> 25:22.010
Sorry.

25:22.761 --> 25:25.179
Hey, Vic, hold on.

25:27.180 --> 25:28.389
Wait up.

25:34.310 --> 25:37.021
- Sorry, I didn't mean to...
- No, no. What's going on?

25:37.938 --> 25:39.272
What's up?

25:40.856 --> 25:42.108
What? What's wrong?

25:42.566 --> 25:45.443
Just... me and Mom.

25:46.194 --> 25:47.195
Yeah?

25:47.320 --> 25:49.154
- Hey, Vic.
- Hi.

25:49.279 --> 25:52.156
- Kind of a surprise.
- Yeah, I know.

25:52.281 --> 25:55.784
Sorry I was throwing myself around
last night. I was just...

25:57.536 --> 25:59.328
...surprised you left, is all.

25:59.453 --> 26:00.496
That's OK.

26:02.038 --> 26:04.249
We'll figure it out, you know?

26:08.335 --> 26:11.921
We can put her in my craft room.
We can move some stuff around.

26:12.587 --> 26:14.172
Right. Yeah.

26:15.257 --> 26:16.507
OK?

26:18.134 --> 26:21.136
- Does Mom know you're here?
- Uh-huh.

26:25.556 --> 26:28.099
Here we have the laboratory.

26:28.599 --> 26:30.767
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:42.359 --> 26:43.818
Do you not want me here?

26:44.402 --> 26:46.237
Of course I want you here.

26:46.654 --> 26:49.614
I'm just not sure this is
the best place for you right now.

26:49.739 --> 26:51.532
You have school, and college stuff.

26:51.657 --> 26:53.950
Mom doesn't want me to go to college.

26:56.494 --> 26:58.453
At least you believe I can do it.

26:58.579 --> 27:01.080
Hey, of course
you can go to college.

27:01.914 --> 27:05.041
Look, Tiff's... kind of funny

27:05.167 --> 27:08.377
about people, you know,
touching her crap.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.671
- Crap's right.
- Hey.

27:12.046 --> 27:14.090
This is her house. OK?

27:14.215 --> 27:17.259
Be nice, and just, you know,
don't touch anything.

27:18.968 --> 27:21.053
That's you and Grandma.

27:22.846 --> 27:25.931
That's supposed to be a surprise,
so please don't touch that.

27:26.056 --> 27:27.516
Grandma loved Mom.

27:29.559 --> 27:32.352
Everybody loved your mom.
That woman lit up a room.

27:40.275 --> 27:42.235
Dad, I have to ask you something.

27:46.946 --> 27:49.364
Can you ever see us in a way, like...

27:50.073 --> 27:51.992
you could ever come home?

27:52.825 --> 27:54.452
You and me and Mom?

28:00.080 --> 28:01.498
Look...

28:06.294 --> 28:08.795
Your mom and I grew up together,
right?

28:10.421 --> 28:12.006
We had some good times.

28:12.632 --> 28:14.382
Best of all, we had you.

28:20.179 --> 28:22.096
Things have changed between us.

28:24.181 --> 28:26.183
I can never go back there.

28:27.434 --> 28:28.559
OK?

28:30.269 --> 28:31.269
You understand?

28:32.520 --> 28:33.730
Yeah.

28:36.732 --> 28:37.566
Yeah.

28:39.859 --> 28:43.028
I'm going to go smooth it out
with Tiffany. You stay in here.

28:44.071 --> 28:45.029
OK.

28:47.281 --> 28:49.532
I'm sure it's cool, you know?

28:51.493 --> 28:52.534
You, me and Tiff.

28:59.122 --> 29:00.374
Alright.

29:12.007 --> 29:15.885
Fella come in for some body work
on a '38 Wraith.

29:16.010 --> 29:18.512
Bended-up left front fender.

29:19.012 --> 29:21.555
Needed to replace the brake drums.

29:21.973 --> 29:25.058
Said he'd spun out on some black ice
into a ditch.

29:25.183 --> 29:26.725
When was this?

29:26.850 --> 29:29.603
Thirty-two years ago, come October.

29:31.813 --> 29:34.147
Well, you seem sure about the date.

29:34.856 --> 29:38.192
That's when my son and my grandson
disappeared with the car

29:38.317 --> 29:40.403
and the son of a bitch who owned it.

29:41.236 --> 29:43.446
- You remember the owner?
- Yeah.

29:43.571 --> 29:47.657
He was a sickly fella. Bad teeth.
About 80 years old.

29:49.242 --> 29:51.368
And your son fixed his car?

29:52.703 --> 29:55.204
Robbie got spellbound on that car.

29:55.329 --> 29:57.748
Even when it did spooky stuff.

29:58.373 --> 30:00.083
Spooky stuff like what?

30:00.208 --> 30:02.835
Goddamn thing started by itself.

30:05.003 --> 30:08.588
Robbie would say
it was crossed ignition wires.

30:09.172 --> 30:11.717
One day I come home
and Robbie Junior's yelling,

30:11.841 --> 30:13.718
"Grandma, the car got Daddy."

30:13.843 --> 30:18.596
I come out. The goddamn thing has
Robbie pinned against a garage wall.

30:20.806 --> 30:25.268
Robbie said it was his fault.
The thing rolled off its blocks.

30:27.311 --> 30:29.562
That car had a mind of its own.

30:32.440 --> 30:33.898
Then...

30:34.316 --> 30:36.026
one day I come home,

30:36.525 --> 30:38.527
and the car is gone.

30:39.570 --> 30:43.031
My son is gone,
and so is my grandson.

30:49.368 --> 30:53.455
Well, I... reckon people leave
for all kinds of reasons.

30:53.579 --> 30:55.497
They didn't leave, Sheriff.

30:55.622 --> 30:57.498
My family was took.

30:58.207 --> 31:02.586
But in my heart of hearts,
I know that little rat-face took 'em.

31:03.378 --> 31:04.795
Somehow.

31:12.343 --> 31:13.761
Well...

31:15.261 --> 31:18.013
...if somebody comes asking
for old Wraith parts,

31:18.138 --> 31:19.765
will you give me a call?

31:19.890 --> 31:21.849
A lot of good it will do you.

31:22.725 --> 31:24.185
But yeah.

31:45.575 --> 31:46.742
Christmasland?

31:47.618 --> 31:50.036
No, Christmasland is to the west.

31:51.329 --> 31:55.082
And once a year, Bing Partridge,

31:55.707 --> 31:58.000
I take someone special.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.418
Me?

31:59.543 --> 32:01.169
All children are welcome

32:01.294 --> 32:05.547
but adults
must first prove their worth.

32:05.672 --> 32:08.383
I'll do anything, Mr Manx.

32:09.884 --> 32:13.594
I need you to help me
save ten children.

32:14.345 --> 32:16.430
Save them from monsters.

32:17.639 --> 32:18.765
What monsters?

32:19.516 --> 32:21.100
Their parents.

32:21.683 --> 32:23.560
The bad ones.

32:24.685 --> 32:28.230
If every day was Christmas
for a child,

32:28.355 --> 32:31.565
instead of another day
of misery and woe,

32:32.191 --> 32:34.526
wouldn't that be wonderful?

32:35.151 --> 32:38.112
Yeah. I guess so.

32:39.279 --> 32:42.407
Excuse me, Mr Manx,
taking children from their parents,

32:42.532 --> 32:44.075
isn't that kidnapping?

32:44.200 --> 32:46.326
Absolutely not.

32:47.536 --> 32:50.329
It's a matter of rescue
and retrieval.

32:51.913 --> 32:56.458
Any child would give their teeth
to live an eternity in Christmasland.

32:59.961 --> 33:03.338
There's something ahead
I want you to see.

33:17.682 --> 33:20.767
Tiff! You know Vic's
going to art school?

33:21.393 --> 33:23.561
She's got a talent like you, babe.

33:23.644 --> 33:26.604
Of course she does.
She's your daughter.

33:26.729 --> 33:28.982
Yeah, well, I need to get in first.

33:30.274 --> 33:31.900
And when would that be?

33:32.526 --> 33:34.360
Applications are due soon.

33:36.154 --> 33:37.821
So you'd be on your way...

33:39.322 --> 33:41.115
Next fall, if I get in.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.993
- What do you mean, if you get in?
- If I get in.

33:46.494 --> 33:48.203
You're a shoe-in.

33:50.622 --> 33:52.373
Oh, shit.

33:58.085 --> 34:00.463
This is ridiculous, Vicky.
Get in the car.

34:00.588 --> 34:03.673
- You shouldn't be here.
- Neither should you. Get your stuff.

34:03.798 --> 34:05.007
I'm not leaving.

34:05.132 --> 34:06.967
She came here to try to save you.

34:07.092 --> 34:09.719
- You know what, Linda...
- Save him? From what?

34:09.844 --> 34:12.679
- From this. From this.
- Oh, OK!

34:12.804 --> 34:15.347
She came here
because she has a talent.

34:15.473 --> 34:17.099
She wants to go to college.

34:17.224 --> 34:18.350
Vicky, look at me.

34:18.476 --> 34:20.685
You stay in this flophouse
with your father,

34:20.810 --> 34:24.855
the closest you'll come to college
is tending bar with a baby bump,

34:24.980 --> 34:28.357
next to the valedictorian
of Margaritaville over here.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.985
Pardon my French! I'm sorry,
what's wrong with tending bar?

34:32.110 --> 34:34.445
- You clean houses.
- At least I don't wreck 'em.

34:35.070 --> 34:37.112
How long you been
banging my husband?

34:37.197 --> 34:39.114
I give Chrissy the love he deserves.

34:40.072 --> 34:42.743
- And I don't push him.
- Linda, get back in your car.

34:43.534 --> 34:45.745
Fix it with your hands, drunk!
Go ahead.

34:45.870 --> 34:48.163
Alright, that's
what we're doing here?

34:48.246 --> 34:50.289
Give her a preview, huh?

34:50.414 --> 34:51.540
Stop it!

34:51.665 --> 34:54.333
I'm calling the cops. OK?
Is that what you want?

34:54.458 --> 34:56.710
Call the cops, right now. Alright?

34:56.835 --> 34:58.670
I do not want the police here.

34:58.795 --> 35:03.216
I am not leaving without Vicky.
I'm not leaving without her.

35:05.175 --> 35:06.218
Vic?

35:07.426 --> 35:08.969
Vic!

35:14.806 --> 35:16.308
Fix it with your hands, drunk!

35:16.433 --> 35:18.434
Preview of the coming attraction!

35:18.559 --> 35:20.811
I'm gonna call the cops.
Is that what you want?

35:43.994 --> 35:45.496
Don't worry.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.914
You're... You're safe here.

35:50.082 --> 35:51.208
Where am I?

35:51.750 --> 35:54.752
Here. Here, Iowa.

35:55.878 --> 35:57.254
Iowa?

35:57.379 --> 36:01.465
What? No.
I'm from Haverhill, Massachusetts.

36:02.091 --> 36:04.050
Well, you came a long way.

36:04.175 --> 36:06.469
You are the Brat, right?

36:09.971 --> 36:12.932
And I'm guessing
the motorbike is your knife,

36:13.057 --> 36:16.309
and that old bridge over there
is your inscape.

36:17.226 --> 36:18.435
Of course, sorry.

36:18.561 --> 36:21.896
You look about that age. This is
still probably pretty new to you.

36:22.021 --> 36:23.897
You think you're going crazy,

36:24.022 --> 36:26.650
but you're not. You're...

36:26.775 --> 36:28.568
You're a strong creative.

36:33.780 --> 36:37.616
Wait, do you have something for me?
Something someone left or lost?

36:39.200 --> 36:41.618
Yeah. Yeah, I've been expecting you.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.165
I'm not really supposed
to crash here,

36:48.290 --> 36:52.501
but Miss Howard takes pity on me
because I'm an orphan.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.506
I've seen this place before.

37:00.382 --> 37:02.508
My Scrabble tiles told me
you were coming.

37:02.633 --> 37:05.469
They can tell me
just about anything, if I listen.

37:05.969 --> 37:09.722
They can't give me proper nouns,
though, like in Scrabble.

37:09.847 --> 37:12.099
But nicknames are OK,
hence "the Brat."

37:12.224 --> 37:14.976
I'm Maggie Leigh, by the way.

37:16.977 --> 37:18.395
Vic McQueen.

37:18.854 --> 37:20.438
My dad calls me Brat.

37:21.355 --> 37:24.941
Well, Brat, let's go
take care of that knee.

37:42.329 --> 37:43.830
I like your fish tank.

37:44.496 --> 37:47.332
Thank you.
It is a pain in the ass to clean.

37:53.545 --> 37:56.797
So what did you call my bridge
before, when we were outside?

37:56.922 --> 38:01.092
It's an inscape. It's a world dreamed
up in your imagination.

38:01.550 --> 38:02.801
Everybody has them

38:02.885 --> 38:06.346
but only strong creatives
can pull theirs into the real world

38:06.763 --> 38:07.930
with the help of a knife.

38:08.056 --> 38:11.016
- My bike?
- Exactly.

38:11.642 --> 38:13.601
It cuts the fabric
between the real world

38:13.684 --> 38:14.935
and the world of thought.

38:16.061 --> 38:18.480
And allows you
to access your bridge.

38:18.979 --> 38:20.105
Sorry.

38:26.902 --> 38:28.487
So every time I cross it,

38:28.612 --> 38:32.323
my head kills me and my left eye
feels like there's a needle in it.

38:32.906 --> 38:34.532
That is the...

38:35.283 --> 38:38.202
cost... of a gift.

38:38.327 --> 38:40.870
I didn't used to stutter
before my bag found me.

38:40.995 --> 38:43.497
I was about your age,
maybe a little younger,

38:43.622 --> 38:45.791
but it varies, like puberty.

38:46.999 --> 38:48.626
I know what you're thinking.

38:49.251 --> 38:50.877
Why you, right?

38:51.002 --> 38:52.337
Or me?

38:52.837 --> 38:54.755
But think about it.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.591
Some people are movie stars.

38:58.716 --> 39:01.677
Some people speak
a dozen foreign languages

39:01.802 --> 39:03.969
or are amazing cooks,

39:04.095 --> 39:07.014
and some people
are strong creatives.

39:07.139 --> 39:09.015
People like us?

39:09.599 --> 39:13.185
I'm a medium.
It's a gift, but it's different.

39:13.894 --> 39:17.188
I help interpret the static.

39:20.774 --> 39:22.483
Thank you.

39:22.608 --> 39:24.901
You said that you had
something for me.

39:25.527 --> 39:29.822
My tiles, they've been chatting
about you for days.

39:39.328 --> 39:42.039
What is the Brat here to find?

39:46.959 --> 39:48.335
Oh, God, no. I don't...

39:50.253 --> 39:52.213
It's creepy, I know.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.101
"The Wraith."
Is that something you lost?

40:11.226 --> 40:13.811
No, but I am looking for him.

40:13.936 --> 40:15.187
It's a guy?

40:15.312 --> 40:19.274
It is a serial child abductor.

40:19.941 --> 40:22.151
He's a strong creative too.

40:24.026 --> 40:25.903
He took a kid I know.

40:29.740 --> 40:31.407
I think I should start heading out

40:31.532 --> 40:35.660
before my bridge or inscape
starts to fade, or...

40:35.785 --> 40:37.328
Thank you.

40:37.454 --> 40:39.037
Thank you so much.

40:40.956 --> 40:44.375
Yeah, but my tiles say that you're
supposed to help me find...

40:44.500 --> 40:47.836
Thank you for all the help, Maggie.
I'm sorry you lost your friend.

40:47.961 --> 40:50.671
Daniel. His name is Daniel Moore.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.214
He's eight years old, Vic.

40:53.923 --> 40:56.967
The Wraith killed his mother
and took him

40:57.092 --> 41:00.219
from the only home he knows,
Vic, OK? Please, just wait.

41:02.220 --> 41:06.557
You are the only person
that can stop him, OK?

41:06.682 --> 41:09.434
The girl who finds lost things
can find lost children.

41:09.559 --> 41:11.603
Don't you see you've been chosen?

41:16.397 --> 41:18.149
I don't want to be chosen.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.442
Your tiles are wrong.

41:42.082 --> 41:43.083
Vic?

41:45.126 --> 41:46.002
Haley.

41:47.086 --> 41:48.587
How did you do that?

41:50.172 --> 41:52.215
Haley, listen to me.

41:53.007 --> 41:55.467
You never, ever
tell anyone about this.

41:55.592 --> 41:58.052
- Where did the bridge go?
- Haley, promise me.

41:58.177 --> 41:59.428
You're squeezing my arm.

41:59.553 --> 42:02.013
The bridge?
That bridge is dangerous.

42:02.138 --> 42:03.515
There's bats in there

42:03.598 --> 42:06.391
and strange places
and strange people.

42:07.142 --> 42:08.976
- You're scaring me.
- Good.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.229
Promise you won't tell.

42:11.812 --> 42:13.063
I promise.

42:13.730 --> 42:15.439
I promise.

42:19.943 --> 42:22.277
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

42:26.322 --> 42:28.241
What are you doing out here anyways?

42:28.866 --> 42:30.283
Mittens ran away.

42:30.784 --> 42:34.745
He'll come back.
He always does, doesn't he?

42:35.579 --> 42:37.497
Let's go home. I'll give you a ride.

42:38.331 --> 42:39.873
Helmet on.

42:44.210 --> 42:45.837
Hop on.

42:49.548 --> 42:52.883
Squeeze my waist real tight.
Don't let go.

43:24.697 --> 43:26.907
Mr Manx, Mr Manx!

43:31.119 --> 43:33.161
There's a dead girl in the ice.

43:34.705 --> 43:36.414
Not dead.

43:38.332 --> 43:39.708
Not yet.

43:41.376 --> 43:43.586
Maybe not for many years.

43:51.383 --> 43:53.050
What is this place?

43:55.761 --> 44:00.598
This, Mr Partridge,
is the Graveyard of What Might Be.

44:01.390 --> 44:03.308
These are all children...

44:04.976 --> 44:08.186
...who, if I do nothing,
will have their childhoods stolen

44:08.312 --> 44:10.646
by their mothers and fathers.

44:11.606 --> 44:13.107
All of them.

44:18.569 --> 44:20.612
Beaten with chains,

44:21.112 --> 44:22.864
fed cat food,

44:22.989 --> 44:25.282
sold to perverts...

44:33.455 --> 44:35.080
Consider this one.

44:40.126 --> 44:41.752
Lily Carter.

44:44.795 --> 44:48.214
Turned to a life of sin
by her father.

44:54.595 --> 44:56.596
She never had a chance.

44:57.013 --> 45:00.307
Her childhood ended
before it even began.

45:03.267 --> 45:08.021
If only there had been another
to take her off to Christmasland.

45:26.909 --> 45:30.620
You could line all these parents up
and put a bullet in their brains,

45:30.745 --> 45:32.205
for all I care.

45:37.291 --> 45:38.834
Or a nail.

45:43.546 --> 45:47.091
I wish I could have saved you
back then, Bing.

45:49.008 --> 45:51.051
But will you help me
save the others?

45:51.885 --> 45:53.553
Before it's too late.

45:55.596 --> 45:57.473
Yes. Yes.

46:00.934 --> 46:02.309
Good.

46:03.560 --> 46:05.770
Let's go back to the car
for some hot cocoa.

46:05.895 --> 46:07.814
Then we have work to do.

46:11.983 --> 46:13.734
There is someone who might threaten

46:13.859 --> 46:15.986
the magic and wonder
of Christmasland.

46:16.111 --> 46:17.862
Someone in Haverhill.

46:22.281 --> 46:23.574
Tell me, Bing Partridge,

46:23.658 --> 46:26.702
what do you
know about the Shorter Way?
