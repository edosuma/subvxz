02:44.114 --> 02:44.740
In here.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.158
The doctor's expecting you.

02:46.450 --> 02:47.246
Thank you.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.385
Ah, Dr. Martin.

03:00.672 --> 03:01.298
Yes.

03:03.342 --> 03:05.640
You'll forgive me for not rising.

03:05.928 --> 03:06.645
An accident?

03:06.929 --> 03:08.556
Might call it that.

03:08.847 --> 03:11.225
Carelessness, actually.

03:11.517 --> 03:13.895
Never turn your back on a patient.

03:14.186 --> 03:15.688
They teach you that at school, don't they?

03:15.979 --> 03:17.697
Yes they do, Dr. Starr.

03:17.981 --> 03:19.608
Dr. Rutherford.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.197
Lionel Rutherford.

03:22.152 --> 03:22.869
Ah.

03:24.196 --> 03:28.076
I understood that Dr. Starr
was head of this institution.

03:28.367 --> 03:30.244
I'm Dr. Starr's associate.

03:30.536 --> 03:31.879
Sit down. Sit down.

03:33.831 --> 03:35.754
You advertised for a senior houseman.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.088
I sent along my credentials

03:37.376 --> 03:39.219
and Dr. Starr asked me to
come along for an interview.

03:39.503 --> 03:41.722
I've read your report.

03:42.005 --> 03:45.179
It doesn't tell me what I need to know.

03:45.467 --> 03:47.811
Your background qualifies you to set up

03:48.095 --> 03:50.723
a fashionable psychiatric practice

03:52.266 --> 03:54.485
to hold wealthy old ladies by the hand

03:54.768 --> 03:58.898
while they tell you about
their horrible husbands.

03:59.189 --> 04:02.989
But we're along way from
Harley Street out here.

04:04.611 --> 04:05.533
This is a...

04:06.447 --> 04:07.915
an asylum

04:08.198 --> 04:10.075
for the incurably insane.

04:12.953 --> 04:17.254
You want to know the
most useful thing here?

04:17.541 --> 04:18.588
This.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.378
Controls to the door upstairs.

04:20.668 --> 04:21.214
No keys.

04:21.503 --> 04:23.471
Just an electrical device.

04:25.215 --> 04:28.310
The door can't be opened from either side

04:28.594 --> 04:30.642
unless I press that button.

04:30.929 --> 04:32.397
- If you're trying to warn
me that some of the inmates

04:32.681 --> 04:34.934
are potentially dangerous,
you needn't worry.

04:35.225 --> 04:37.853
I've dealt with disturbed
patients during my training.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.818
By what methods?

04:40.105 --> 04:41.948
Kindness, understanding,

04:42.232 --> 04:42.778
insight.

04:43.066 --> 04:45.535
Exactly my ways, 20 years ago.

04:47.112 --> 04:49.331
Now I'm not so sure.

04:49.615 --> 04:51.492
Those poor devils up there can't be cured,

04:51.783 --> 04:53.205
they can only be confined

04:53.494 --> 04:55.167
and kept from being dangerous.

04:55.454 --> 04:58.082
Is that Dr. Starr's outlook too?

04:59.458 --> 05:01.711
Dr. Starr is upstairs now.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.838
What? With a patient?

05:05.130 --> 05:06.973
Dr. Starr is a patient.

05:09.718 --> 05:12.221
Dr. Starr attacked me a few days ago,

05:12.513 --> 05:14.811
suddenly, without warning.

05:15.098 --> 05:17.226
That's how I injured my leg.

05:18.727 --> 05:19.478
Yes.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.907
Working with the mentally disturbed

05:24.191 --> 05:25.989
can lead to a breakdown.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.452
- The nurse and orderly
managed to transfer Dr. Starr

05:30.739 --> 05:32.867
upstairs with the other patients.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.455
I can't go there.

05:34.743 --> 05:37.496
The orderly gives me reports.

05:37.788 --> 05:41.634
He says the doctor is
perfectly rational now.

05:41.917 --> 05:43.464
Except for one thing.

05:45.003 --> 05:48.507
A new personality seems
to have taken over.

05:49.758 --> 05:52.762
With its own name and its own life story.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.976
These terrible feud.

05:55.264 --> 05:57.767
Meaningless labor, don't you think?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.686
It describes something that exists.

06:00.978 --> 06:03.356
From time to time, a man disappears

06:03.647 --> 06:06.491
and his discovered much later
living in a different town,

06:06.775 --> 06:09.198
under a different name,
following a different occupation

06:09.486 --> 06:11.454
because something happened
in his earlier life

06:11.738 --> 06:13.706
that made it completely intolerable.

06:13.991 --> 06:18.087
- You believe you could
recognize such a case?

06:18.370 --> 06:19.371
I'm certain of it.

06:19.663 --> 06:21.006
Very well.

06:21.290 --> 06:23.338
We'll call it a test.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.627
There are several patients upstairs

06:25.919 --> 06:29.014
with the sort of condition you describe.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.599
Go up there.

06:31.883 --> 06:33.135
Talk to them.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.897
If you can recognize
who is or was Dr. Starr

06:38.682 --> 06:42.983
then I'll consider you
qualified for the position.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.147
I will recognize him.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.065
Him?

06:47.649 --> 06:50.323
How do you know the doc is a man?

07:04.458 --> 07:05.129
Reynolds?

07:05.417 --> 07:06.669
Yes, doctor?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.303
Reynolds,

07:08.587 --> 07:11.215
I'm sending a young man upstairs.

07:11.506 --> 07:12.177
Martin.

07:12.466 --> 07:13.183
Dr. Martin.

07:14.843 --> 07:16.686
Now listen to me carefully.

09:27.893 --> 09:29.361
Dr. Martin'?

09:29.644 --> 09:31.396
I'm Max Reynolds, the orderly.

09:31.688 --> 09:32.689
I'm pleased to meet you.

09:32.981 --> 09:34.107
Come this way.

09:37.986 --> 09:39.408
It keeps out the draft,

09:39.696 --> 09:41.744
<i>as Dr. Starr used to say.</i>

09:42.032 --> 09:43.500
You know why I'm here?

09:43.784 --> 09:46.082
- Dr. Rutherford gave
me full instructions.

09:46.369 --> 09:48.212
What can you tell me about the doctor?

09:48.497 --> 09:49.794
Who? Rutherford?

09:50.832 --> 09:52.209
Starr.

09:52.501 --> 09:53.673
Nothing.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.931
You are to be given full
cooperation but no clues.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.885
Are all these rooms occupied?

10:01.176 --> 10:02.302
Yes.

10:02.594 --> 10:04.096
We keep them locked, of course.

10:04.387 --> 10:06.014
A security measure.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.310
- This one isn't.
- It's my office.

10:09.601 --> 10:11.820
- Are the patients free
to move around at all?

10:12.103 --> 10:13.104
They're not to badly off.

10:13.396 --> 10:14.522
You'll see for yourself.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.566
First patient.

10:15.857 --> 10:16.403
Mhmm.

10:16.691 --> 10:17.943
Name'?

10:18.235 --> 10:20.283
She calls herself Bonnie.

10:21.363 --> 10:22.706
B. Starr.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.206
That's a question for you to decide.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.503
J1 We're having

10:28.787 --> 10:32.712
J1 Tea in the afternoon J1

10:38.588 --> 10:39.714
Hello, Bonnie.

10:40.882 --> 10:41.633
Bonnie?

10:42.717 --> 10:43.639
Come along.

10:43.927 --> 10:46.146
Here's Dr. Martin to see you.

10:50.559 --> 10:52.561
Leave me alone.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.480
I was hoping I could talk to you.

10:54.771 --> 10:55.613
Talk?

10:57.232 --> 11:00.202
That's all you people ever do is talk.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.532
Nobody listens.

11:02.821 --> 11:03.993
I listen too.

11:06.241 --> 11:08.164
You wouldn't believe me.

11:08.451 --> 11:11.751
Perhaps not, but I am willing to listen.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.126
Well,

11:16.418 --> 11:18.887
if it makes any difference.

11:24.843 --> 11:27.062
- I hope to God we
get to the airport on time.

11:27.345 --> 11:28.437
For the last time Walter,

11:28.722 --> 11:30.144
there's nothing to worry about.

11:30.432 --> 11:31.399
Did it arrive?

11:31.683 --> 11:32.354
Yes it did.

11:32.642 --> 11:34.440
They finished installing
it about an hour ago.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.105
There's nothing to worry about.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.613
It's easy enough for you to say, Bonnie,

11:37.898 --> 11:39.491
but supposing something goes wrong?

11:39.774 --> 11:41.868
- It can't go wrong, not
if you follow the plan.

11:42.152 --> 11:43.745
I'll follow it.

11:44.029 --> 11:46.202
If only I could see you first.

11:46.489 --> 11:48.912
You'll see me soon enough.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.202
I'll be waiting for you once it's over.

11:51.494 --> 11:53.371
I'll ring you.

12:42.671 --> 12:43.422
Walter?

12:45.256 --> 12:46.883
You're home early.

12:47.175 --> 12:49.849
I didn't get into town today.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.604
But you did get into the brandy.

12:51.888 --> 12:53.686
This happens to be my first drink.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.692
Not your last, I'm sure.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.193
May I fix you one?

12:57.477 --> 12:58.444
Yes, please.

13:00.230 --> 13:01.948
How did your class go?

13:02.232 --> 13:03.279
It's not a class.

13:03.566 --> 13:06.069
Professor Kalanga is a spiritual leader.

13:06.361 --> 13:07.487
Professor.

13:07.779 --> 13:09.497
Back in Africa he'd be
just another witch doctor.

13:09.781 --> 13:11.158
What do you know about it?

13:11.449 --> 13:13.918
Don't forget, I lived there for years.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.078
After all, my father was-

13:15.370 --> 13:17.919
Governor General of the colony.

13:18.915 --> 13:20.758
It's a good thing he can't
see his daughter now.

13:21.042 --> 13:23.136
The poor old boy would turn in his grave.

13:23.420 --> 13:26.469
<i>Taking voodoo lessons
from a black charlatan.</i>

13:26.756 --> 13:28.133
It is not voodoo.

13:30.051 --> 13:32.930
There are natural forces
which are stronger

13:33.221 --> 13:34.598
than life or death.

13:35.807 --> 13:38.276
Forces which modern,
civilized man has forgotten.

13:38.560 --> 13:42.235
- I wish you'd forget
all of this mumbo-jumbo.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.318
What's that?

13:45.108 --> 13:46.860
It's called a wanga.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.571
I think it's revolting.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.331
It's not supposed to be pretty.

13:51.614 --> 13:55.414
The serpent is a symbol of the life force

13:55.702 --> 13:59.707
and the teeth are to
protect one from evil.

13:59.998 --> 14:02.046
There's no evil in your life.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.710
Oh, but there is.

14:05.003 --> 14:06.926
What do you mean?

14:07.213 --> 14:07.839
Bonnie.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.602
- That's all over and
done with, I swear it.

14:15.889 --> 14:19.564
- Only last month you came
and asked me for a divorce.

14:19.851 --> 14:21.068
I haven't seen her since.

14:21.352 --> 14:23.104
You have my word on that.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.943
I'm glad you haven't

14:25.231 --> 14:28.030
because I told you then
and I'm telling you now,

14:28.318 --> 14:30.366
there won't be any divorce.

14:34.199 --> 14:36.372
Oh, I know you, Walter.

14:36.659 --> 14:39.879
You're a weak, vein, selfish opportunist.

14:40.830 --> 14:43.379
You're content to live off my money,

14:43.666 --> 14:44.792
but you are mine

14:47.253 --> 14:49.597
and I will never let you go.

14:49.881 --> 14:50.507
Never.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.769
Now you do understand that, don't you?

14:55.053 --> 14:55.849
Perfectly.

15:05.980 --> 15:06.606
Darling,

15:09.192 --> 15:10.569
I've got a present for you.

15:10.860 --> 15:11.486
" Oh?

15:12.487 --> 15:13.488
What is it?

15:13.780 --> 15:14.656
You'll see.

15:17.867 --> 15:19.369
Come along with me.

15:22.497 --> 15:24.374
I don't see anything.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.918
Downstairs.

15:26.209 --> 15:28.086
In the basement?

15:28.378 --> 15:29.174
After you.

15:30.547 --> 15:32.800
Careful now, mind the steps.

15:36.302 --> 15:37.645
Well?

15:37.929 --> 15:38.600
What is it?

15:40.181 --> 15:41.103
Oh, darling.

15:43.393 --> 15:44.565
It's a freezer.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.486
Do you like it?

15:48.773 --> 15:50.650
Oh, you know I've always wanted one.

15:50.942 --> 15:52.785
What a lovely surprise.

15:53.069 --> 15:54.446
I have another one for you.

15:54.737 --> 15:55.283
What is it?

15:55.572 --> 15:56.198
This.

19:46.135 --> 19:47.307
Rest in pieces.

20:03.945 --> 20:04.616
" Yes?

20:04.904 --> 20:06.622
It's finished.

20:06.906 --> 20:07.873
Good.

20:08.157 --> 20:08.874
Are you all right?

20:09.158 --> 20:11.752
Yeah. How soon can you get here?

20:12.036 --> 20:12.707
I'm just packing.

20:12.995 --> 20:14.793
I should be there within the hour.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.207
I'll be ready.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.090
One more thing, Walter.

20:20.378 --> 20:21.925
We'll have to take her along.

20:22.213 --> 20:23.715
Why? There's no need for that.

20:24.006 --> 20:25.633
No one's gonna check up while we're away.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.848
- I'll be safer if there's
nothing left behind.

20:28.136 --> 20:30.639
They may still suspect,
but they'll have no proof.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.774
We'll dispose of the evidence
on the way to the airport.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.150
We can't talk about it on the phone.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.607
We'll talk when you're here.

20:36.894 --> 20:39.192
For God sake, don't let anyone see you.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.697
I'll bring my car around to the back

20:40.982 --> 20:42.029
and I'll keep the kitchen door unlocked

20:42.316 --> 20:43.693
so I won't have to knock.

20:43.985 --> 20:45.032
All right but hurry.

20:45.319 --> 20:46.662
The sooner we're out of here, the better.

20:46.946 --> 20:47.663
Be right there.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.244
I'll be waiting.

24:04.810 --> 24:05.561
Walter?

24:16.155 --> 24:16.906
Walter'?

24:46.227 --> 24:46.978
Walter'?

25:11.377 --> 25:12.128
Walter'?

28:26.155 --> 28:29.034
They found me lying
there the next morning.

28:29.325 --> 28:32.124
They said I'd strangled Walter.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.789
I tried to tell them about Ruth

28:36.123 --> 28:37.124
and the hand.

28:38.667 --> 28:39.919
But it was gone.

28:42.296 --> 28:43.889
Everything was gone.

28:48.052 --> 28:50.305
But the hand was on my face.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.184
I chopped

28:57.728 --> 28:58.570
and chopped

29:00.606 --> 29:02.028
and chopped at it.

29:12.242 --> 29:14.461
Now do you believe me?

29:14.745 --> 29:15.371
No?

29:27.257 --> 29:29.430
Paranoid psychosis.

29:29.718 --> 29:32.312
How did she come to the asylum?

29:32.596 --> 29:33.939
She could have come as a doctor.

29:34.223 --> 29:35.315
And the wife?

29:35.599 --> 29:39.649
- You'll learn the real cases
when you've made your choice.

29:39.937 --> 29:43.862
That's the service lift from the kitchen.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.071
The next patient?

29:45.359 --> 29:46.827
His name is Bruno.

29:49.113 --> 29:49.864
Bruno?

29:51.615 --> 29:53.117
This is Dr. Martin.

30:04.670 --> 30:06.843
What are you making?

30:07.131 --> 30:08.599
Whatever you like.

30:09.883 --> 30:12.477
Could it be a surgical gown?

30:12.761 --> 30:15.139
I can make whatever you wish.

30:16.974 --> 30:17.816
It could be

30:18.767 --> 30:20.189
a surgical gown...

30:23.272 --> 30:24.194
or a shroud.

30:29.570 --> 30:30.571
I'm a tailor.

30:32.573 --> 30:34.541
Doctors can sew.

30:34.825 --> 30:35.451
Stitch.

30:37.870 --> 30:39.713
Always been a tailor.

30:43.834 --> 30:44.881
Always.

31:04.146 --> 31:05.773
Oh, Mr. Stebbins.

31:06.065 --> 31:06.941
Good evening.

31:08.817 --> 31:11.866
It's the first of the month.

31:12.154 --> 31:13.246
The rent is due.

31:15.032 --> 31:18.536
Mr. Stebbins, I've got a wonderful idea.

31:18.827 --> 31:19.578
Have you got the rent?

31:19.870 --> 31:21.417
Every month you come here

31:21.705 --> 31:25.084
and always you are wearing the same suit.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.547
Nothing wrong with my suit.

31:26.835 --> 31:27.381
Gives me good wear.

31:27.669 --> 31:28.841
Wear, yes.

31:29.129 --> 31:30.096
But style, no.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.225
Now listen.

31:33.509 --> 31:38.060
For one month's rent, I could
make for you such a suit.

31:38.347 --> 31:39.599
I don't need a suit.

31:39.890 --> 31:43.110
And if I did, I wouldn't get it from you.

31:48.899 --> 31:50.321
I haven't got it.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.326
Now see here-

31:51.610 --> 31:52.236
No, no, no.

31:52.528 --> 31:53.404
You see here.

31:55.072 --> 31:56.494
You see this shop.

31:58.575 --> 32:00.953
Fine people used to come here

32:01.245 --> 32:03.293
for fine tailoring.

32:03.580 --> 32:07.175
Now a little dressing, a little mending.

32:07.459 --> 32:08.426
It's all I get.

32:08.710 --> 32:10.257
I will pay the rent,

32:10.546 --> 32:13.800
but you must give me a little more time.

32:14.091 --> 32:15.308
I'll tell you what,

32:15.592 --> 32:17.686
today's Monday, right?

32:17.970 --> 32:19.893
I'll be back here on Saturday morning.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.477
Saturday morning?

32:21.765 --> 32:22.812
Bright and early.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.852
And if you haven't got the rent,

32:25.144 --> 32:26.771
you can start packing.

32:32.276 --> 32:33.243
No tricks now.

32:35.070 --> 32:35.992
No tricks.

32:40.617 --> 32:41.743
Your supper, it's ready.

32:42.035 --> 32:43.252
I'm not hungry.

32:44.872 --> 32:46.499
Something is wrong?

32:50.460 --> 32:52.508
Not something, Anna,

32:52.796 --> 32:53.513
everything.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.550
Mr. Stebbins was here.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.428
He's giving us one week.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.643
A man works hard all his life

33:01.930 --> 33:03.728
and then, in one week...

33:05.309 --> 33:07.186
Where can we go?

33:14.067 --> 33:15.034
Good evening.

33:15.319 --> 33:16.866
Is the proprietor in?

33:22.367 --> 33:24.119
I am the proprietor.

33:38.967 --> 33:40.560
Go have your supper.

33:44.431 --> 33:45.557
Now,

33:45.849 --> 33:48.318
what can I do for you, Mister...

33:49.394 --> 33:50.145
Smith.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.982
Am I correct in assuming

33:53.273 --> 33:55.776
that you can tailor a
garment from any material

33:56.068 --> 33:57.536
of my own selection?

33:57.819 --> 34:00.743
You want I should make you a suit?

34:01.907 --> 34:02.533
Exactly.

34:03.575 --> 34:06.419
I have a fine stock of woolens here.

34:06.703 --> 34:08.295
That will not be necessary.

34:10.373 --> 34:13.092
I brought my own material.

34:13.377 --> 34:14.003
I see.

34:15.003 --> 34:18.632
You will be wanting something special.

34:18.924 --> 34:19.550
Correct.

34:21.301 --> 34:23.099
Something very special.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.938
There's enough here for a suit, I believe.

34:29.226 --> 34:29.851
Unusual.

34:33.981 --> 34:34.902
Special.

34:35.190 --> 34:39.239
- It will be difficult to
work from such a fabric,

34:39.527 --> 34:41.746
but I can promise you a suit.

34:42.822 --> 34:45.042
Now if you will just slip off your coat

34:45.324 --> 34:46.827
so I can make measure.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.871
The suit is not for me.

34:49.161 --> 34:50.254
It is for my son.

34:50.539 --> 34:51.585
Oh.

34:51.873 --> 34:55.092
When will he come in for a fitting?

34:55.377 --> 34:56.879
It's to be a surprise.

34:57.170 --> 34:59.013
Oh, a present.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.471
You might call it that.

35:01.758 --> 35:05.479
I've written down all the measurements.

35:05.762 --> 35:08.481
Made various diagrams of the style.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.781
Expensive.

35:16.064 --> 35:17.691
- Then you'll have to
charge me accordingly.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.860
Shall we say, 200 pounds?

35:21.737 --> 35:22.454
200?

35:25.824 --> 35:27.417
I will begin immediately.

35:27.701 --> 35:28.623
No.

35:28.910 --> 35:30.412
This schedule.

35:30.704 --> 35:32.502
It is of the greatest importance

35:32.789 --> 35:34.132
that you work on the suit

35:34.416 --> 35:37.044
only during the hours listed here.

35:40.464 --> 35:42.182
But these times,

35:42.466 --> 35:45.060
they're all past midnight.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.597
I happen to believe in astrology.

35:47.888 --> 35:48.935
The stars?

35:49.222 --> 35:51.645
I take it you are not a believer?

35:51.933 --> 35:52.525
No matter.

35:52.809 --> 35:54.152
All that concerns you

35:54.436 --> 35:58.157
is following these
instructions to the letter.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.657
There must be no mistake.

35:59.941 --> 36:00.863
Is that clear?

36:01.151 --> 36:02.494
No mistake.

36:02.778 --> 36:05.327
Everything will be as you wish.

36:06.323 --> 36:07.074
I swear.

36:08.075 --> 36:09.497
You'll find my address written

36:09.785 --> 36:11.662
on the top of the first sheet.

36:11.953 --> 36:13.580
When may I have delivery?

36:13.872 --> 36:15.089
Um.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.842
Today is Monday.

36:17.125 --> 36:19.844
If I start tonight I'll...

36:20.128 --> 36:21.050
Yeah.

36:21.338 --> 36:24.057
I can bring you the suit on Friday.

36:25.175 --> 36:26.643
Excellent.

36:26.927 --> 36:30.477
I shall expect you the
moment it is finished.

36:36.061 --> 36:36.812
Remember,

36:37.729 --> 36:38.901
my instructions.

36:39.189 --> 36:40.315
Oh, I promise.

36:41.483 --> 36:42.405
Goodnight.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.635
Who was that man?

37:00.919 --> 37:01.920
Customer.

37:02.212 --> 37:03.930
He ordered a suit.

37:04.214 --> 37:05.887
200 pounds he will pay.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.222
Now I'm afraid.

37:09.678 --> 37:11.180
There is something not
right in all of this.

37:11.471 --> 37:13.974
Something that will make you trouble.

37:14.266 --> 37:15.813
I must do it.

38:21.041 --> 38:22.714
What is it?

38:23.001 --> 38:23.627
Ugh.

38:25.253 --> 38:28.974
The instructions said
to work to five o'clock.

38:30.759 --> 38:33.353
I tried to work a little longer.

39:13.969 --> 39:15.562
It is finished?

39:15.845 --> 39:18.064
I'm the one who's finished.

39:19.641 --> 39:20.938
Four nights.

39:21.226 --> 39:22.944
Nothing but work.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.447
Midnight to just before dawn.

39:28.108 --> 39:29.325
Now it's done.

39:29.609 --> 39:30.656
May I see it?

39:37.075 --> 39:38.201
It is strange.

39:39.703 --> 39:41.125
You're going to press it'?

39:41.413 --> 39:41.959
No, no.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.170
Mr. Smith doesn't want it pressed.

39:44.457 --> 39:45.549
Then what will you do?

39:45.834 --> 39:46.380
Deliver it,

39:46.668 --> 39:47.590
just as he said.

39:47.877 --> 39:48.969
Right now.

40:58.406 --> 40:59.783
At last.

41:00.075 --> 41:01.918
Did you bring it?

41:02.202 --> 41:03.169
Ah, good!

41:03.453 --> 41:04.670
Come in! Come in!

41:16.966 --> 41:17.717
This way.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.191
Another two steps down.

41:31.856 --> 41:32.607
In here.

41:35.527 --> 41:36.278
My study.

41:47.122 --> 41:48.669
The suit is completed?

41:48.957 --> 41:50.254
Oh yes.

41:50.542 --> 41:54.513
It was difficult working
with such material

41:54.796 --> 41:56.343
and at night, no less.

41:56.631 --> 41:58.224
But you followed the instructions?

41:58.508 --> 42:00.806
Just as you ordered.

42:01.094 --> 42:01.811
Splendid.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.724
You have no idea how much this means to me

42:06.015 --> 42:07.232
and to my son.

42:07.517 --> 42:08.234
Your son.

42:09.519 --> 42:10.441
Where is he?

42:12.021 --> 42:13.022
Nevermind.

42:13.314 --> 42:14.987
Now if I may see the suit.

42:15.275 --> 42:15.901
Um.

42:17.110 --> 42:19.078
Yes, of course, your fee.

42:19.362 --> 42:21.865
Just send me your account
and I'll take care of it.

42:22.157 --> 42:24.706
I must have the money first.

42:24.993 --> 42:26.461
I have bills to pay.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.919
You wouldn't understand.

42:30.206 --> 42:31.708
You're rich.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.252
On the contrary.

42:33.543 --> 42:36.137
I understand the situation only too well.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.423
It so happens, at the moment,

42:38.715 --> 42:41.514
<i>I'm in the same financial
position as yourself.</i>

42:41.801 --> 42:43.144
" You?

42:43.428 --> 42:45.271
Don't misunderstand.

42:45.555 --> 42:48.855
In a very short while, I
shall be in funds again.

42:49.142 --> 42:51.520
Just as soon as my son returns.

42:52.812 --> 42:53.984
Your diamond.

42:55.398 --> 42:56.149
This?

42:58.067 --> 42:58.989
It's a fake.

43:01.780 --> 43:02.906
It was real once,

43:03.198 --> 43:04.745
but I had to dispose of it

43:05.033 --> 43:07.832
in order to continue my work.

43:08.119 --> 43:08.836
<i>My studies.</i>

43:09.913 --> 43:10.664
This book.

43:15.543 --> 43:16.920
It's very old.

43:17.212 --> 43:17.838
Very rare.

43:19.631 --> 43:23.101
The only one of its
kind left in the world.

43:23.384 --> 43:25.307
Cost me my fortune.

43:25.595 --> 43:28.599
You gave all your money for a book?

43:28.890 --> 43:29.857
<i>_ Every penny.</i>

43:31.100 --> 43:33.523
I needed it because of my son.

43:34.604 --> 43:36.857
I sold everything to buy it.

43:38.817 --> 43:40.490
You're lying.

43:40.777 --> 43:42.199
See for yourself.

43:42.487 --> 43:44.160
There is nothing left.

43:45.949 --> 43:48.202
What is in that room?

43:48.493 --> 43:50.370
That room is empty too.

43:51.538 --> 43:53.040
There is nothing in there, I tell you!

43:53.331 --> 43:54.583
Please!

44:10.849 --> 44:12.021
So that's it.

44:14.185 --> 44:15.562
You're a murderer.

44:17.647 --> 44:18.398
No.

44:19.566 --> 44:20.818
I'm no murderer.

44:22.569 --> 44:24.492
He died a natural death.

44:25.697 --> 44:27.449
I knew a long time ago

44:28.408 --> 44:30.251
that it was inevitable.

44:32.912 --> 44:34.004
Can't you see?

44:35.123 --> 44:36.295
This is my son.

44:42.130 --> 44:42.972
Your son?

44:44.007 --> 44:45.884
He was the one I was working for,

44:46.175 --> 44:47.552
planning for.

44:47.844 --> 44:49.642
The book told me what to do.

44:49.929 --> 44:51.806
That's why I had you make the suit.

44:52.098 --> 44:53.065
It is for him.

44:54.392 --> 44:55.439
Give it to me.

44:57.437 --> 44:58.233
No.

44:59.439 --> 45:00.816
First, the money.

45:09.282 --> 45:11.080
You can't stop me now.

45:12.493 --> 45:14.336
No one can stop me now.

45:18.666 --> 45:20.088
Give me that suit.

46:39.163 --> 46:40.756
You sold the suit?

46:42.083 --> 46:42.834
No.

46:44.002 --> 46:46.380
Mr. Stebbins phoned just after you left.

46:46.671 --> 46:48.218
He said to remind you
he's coming for his rent

46:48.506 --> 46:49.598
in the morning.

46:49.882 --> 46:50.758
I told him is was all right.

46:51.050 --> 46:53.052
You were collecting money
from a customer tonight.

46:53.344 --> 46:54.391
You told him!

46:54.679 --> 46:59.185
Anna, I asked you not to say
a word about this to anyone!

46:59.475 --> 47:01.068
Burn! Burn! Burn it!

47:01.352 --> 47:04.196
Put it in the stew and burn it!

47:04.480 --> 47:06.107
Forget about the suit.

47:06.399 --> 47:08.026
Forget I ever made the suit.

47:08.317 --> 47:09.534
Forget about Mr. Smith.

47:09.819 --> 47:10.741
Forget everything!

47:11.029 --> 47:11.575
But-

47:11.863 --> 47:12.489
Burn it!

47:18.494 --> 47:19.871
A fortune, he said.

48:02.330 --> 48:03.081
No fire.

48:10.421 --> 48:12.264
I don't know what we will do now.

48:12.548 --> 48:14.095
Once they see how you look

48:14.383 --> 48:16.477
perhaps they will come in.

48:25.228 --> 48:27.731
I told you to burn the suit.

48:28.022 --> 48:29.490
I put it on Otto.

48:29.774 --> 48:30.570
Otto?

48:30.858 --> 48:33.156
I made a name for him.

48:33.444 --> 48:35.742
I talk to him often, when I am alone.

48:36.030 --> 48:37.077
Anna, please,

48:37.365 --> 48:38.912
burn the suit.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.167
I thought-

48:40.451 --> 48:43.705
No one must ever know it existed.

48:43.996 --> 48:45.168
Mr. Smith knows.

48:45.456 --> 48:47.458
Mr. Smith is dead.

48:47.750 --> 48:48.376
Dead?

48:50.878 --> 48:52.050
I killed him.

48:53.548 --> 48:57.598
It was an accident, but
no one will believe that.

48:57.885 --> 48:59.979
What is that book?

49:00.263 --> 49:01.731
Mr. Smith had it.

49:02.014 --> 49:04.233
It is a book of magic.

49:04.517 --> 49:07.020
There's a spell for making the suit.

49:07.311 --> 49:09.609
The book, too, must be burned.

49:11.149 --> 49:12.526
No.

49:12.817 --> 49:13.864
What do you mean?

49:14.152 --> 49:15.028
Don't you see?

49:15.319 --> 49:17.367
If you have the book you
can show it to the police.

49:17.655 --> 49:18.827
Tell them what happened.

49:19.115 --> 49:20.662
Then they will believe
you speak the truth.

49:20.950 --> 49:22.873
What do you know from the police?

49:23.161 --> 49:25.584
- Bruno, please, for my sake,
tell them what happened.

49:25.872 --> 49:26.919
<i>" No!</i>

49:27.206 --> 49:28.128
Then I'll tell them!

49:28.416 --> 49:29.918
We can not live with murder on our souls!

49:30.209 --> 49:31.631
Anna! No!

49:31.919 --> 49:32.590
No!

49:32.879 --> 49:33.425
No, Anna!

49:45.349 --> 49:46.942
Let go of me, Bruno!

49:59.197 --> 50:00.494
No, Anna!

50:00.781 --> 50:01.873
<i>" No!</i>

50:03.534 --> 50:04.330
Otto!

50:04.619 --> 50:05.245
Oh God!

50:13.544 --> 50:15.592
You must find him.

50:15.880 --> 50:18.599
Somewhere in the city, he is alive.

50:21.177 --> 50:23.100
I tell you, he is alive!

50:35.233 --> 50:36.985
How did it happen?

50:37.276 --> 50:38.368
You know I can't tell you.

50:38.653 --> 50:39.495
Not yet.

50:39.779 --> 50:41.907
Not until I've made my choice.

50:42.198 --> 50:44.826
Dr. Rutherford's orders.

50:45.117 --> 50:46.414
All right.

50:46.702 --> 50:48.124
Who's next?

50:48.412 --> 50:49.959
A strange case.

50:50.248 --> 50:51.716
A very strange case.

50:53.542 --> 50:55.636
Her name is Barbara.

50:58.798 --> 51:00.266
How good of you to come.

51:00.549 --> 51:02.643
You're the lawyer, aren't you?

51:02.927 --> 51:05.430
No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.

51:05.721 --> 51:07.143
But I asked to see a lawyer.

51:07.431 --> 51:08.648
I told you to send for one.

51:08.933 --> 51:10.480
This is Dr. Martin.

51:12.103 --> 51:13.446
Another doctor?

51:14.605 --> 51:16.824
But I'm not ill, you can see that.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.860
A lawyer would know it wasn't my fault.

51:19.151 --> 51:21.279
I haven't accused you of anything.

51:21.570 --> 51:23.197
All doctors are alike.

51:23.489 --> 51:26.288
How can you be so sure about that?

51:27.618 --> 51:28.289
I happen to know a great deal

51:28.577 --> 51:31.046
about the medical profession.

51:31.330 --> 51:32.877
That's interesting.

51:34.583 --> 51:37.177
Did you study medicine yourself?

51:38.212 --> 51:40.180
You ask too many questions.

51:40.464 --> 51:41.966
It's only because I want to help you.

51:42.258 --> 51:44.010
Then get me out of here.

51:44.302 --> 51:44.928
It wasn't my fault.

51:45.219 --> 51:47.347
You've got to understand that.

51:47.638 --> 51:49.766
I had nothing to do with it.

51:51.517 --> 51:52.439
It was Lucy.

51:53.477 --> 51:54.979
Tell me about it.

52:00.276 --> 52:01.152
All right.

52:05.865 --> 52:07.333
All right.

52:22.089 --> 52:23.432
How do you feel, Barbara?

52:23.716 --> 52:24.808
You look marvelous.

52:25.092 --> 52:26.719
I feel fine.

52:27.011 --> 52:28.388
George, if you only
know how wonderful it is

52:28.679 --> 52:30.397
to be coming home again.

52:30.681 --> 52:33.275
- Listen, I hope you are
going to be very, very happy.

52:33.559 --> 52:34.685
Of course I will.

52:34.977 --> 52:36.979
Don't worry, it's not going
to be like the last time.

52:37.271 --> 52:39.114
That's all over with now.

52:39.398 --> 52:40.445
I'm sure of it.

52:41.567 --> 52:42.318
Good.

52:43.986 --> 52:45.738
Nearly there now.

53:19.313 --> 53:20.189
What's the matter?

53:20.481 --> 53:21.027
I don't know.

53:21.315 --> 53:23.909
I could swear I saw someone
looking out of the window.

53:24.193 --> 53:25.695
I thought for a moment it might be Lucy.

53:25.986 --> 53:27.533
- Now remember what you
promised at the hospital.

53:27.822 --> 53:29.244
You are not to mention her name again.

53:29.532 --> 53:30.408
Yes, I know, I'm sorry.

53:30.699 --> 53:31.746
But there is someone inside, isn't there?

53:32.034 --> 53:32.830
Yes.

53:33.119 --> 53:33.665
Who is it?

53:33.953 --> 53:35.330
You'll soon see.

53:35.621 --> 53:36.417
Who is it?

53:36.705 --> 53:37.831
Ah, Nurse Higgins.

53:38.124 --> 53:39.626
This is my sister, Barbara.

53:39.917 --> 53:40.463
Hello.

53:40.751 --> 53:42.970
I've heard so much about you.

53:44.046 --> 53:45.514
Nurse? I don't need a nurse.

53:45.798 --> 53:48.221
- Now it's only temporary
until you get settled in again.

53:48.509 --> 53:49.260
The doctor suggested-

53:49.552 --> 53:50.519
Here, I'll take that, sir.

53:50.803 --> 53:52.771
Shall we go upstairs now'?

53:53.055 --> 53:54.432
Upstairs?

53:54.723 --> 53:56.100
You can pop right into bed.

53:56.392 --> 53:57.735
Bed?

53:58.018 --> 53:59.235
In the middle of the afternoon?

53:59.520 --> 54:00.817
Well, you've had quite a long trip.

54:01.105 --> 54:02.732
You must rest.

54:03.023 --> 54:04.616
But I'm not in the least bit tired.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.073
Now, Barbara, you promised me, remember?

54:07.361 --> 54:11.537
You are to follow the
doctor's instructions.

54:11.824 --> 54:13.041
This is my home.

54:13.325 --> 54:14.042
Our home!

54:15.244 --> 54:18.498
And I hope that we'll be
together here, always.

54:18.789 --> 54:21.633
You don't want to go back
into hospital, do you?

54:21.917 --> 54:22.634
No.

54:22.918 --> 54:24.295
You wouldn't.

54:24.587 --> 54:27.807
I sincerely hope it won't be necessary.

54:28.757 --> 54:30.259
Come along, dear.

54:32.595 --> 54:35.439
Aren't you going to come up?

54:35.723 --> 54:36.349
Later.

54:53.908 --> 54:56.411
- I still think it's ridiculous
going to bed at this hour.

54:56.702 --> 54:58.670
- Doctor says you need a
nap every day before tea

54:58.954 --> 54:59.796
to keep your strength up.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.252
But I'll never sleep.

55:01.540 --> 55:03.918
Here, you're to drink this.

55:04.210 --> 55:04.881
What is it?

55:05.169 --> 55:06.967
- Only a sedative, dear,
to calm your nerves.

55:07.254 --> 55:08.597
I am calm.

55:08.881 --> 55:10.633
Perfectly calm.

55:10.925 --> 55:12.177
If I could just have one of my pills.

55:12.468 --> 55:16.348
- Now we're not to have
any more of those things.

55:19.642 --> 55:20.859
That's better.

55:21.143 --> 55:22.110
Now, in we go.

55:29.360 --> 55:30.111
All comfy.

55:40.788 --> 55:41.914
Try to sleep now

55:42.206 --> 55:44.504
and I'll look in on you a little later on.

55:44.792 --> 55:48.137
Tonight, after dinner,
we'll have a nice chat.

55:48.420 --> 55:50.548
- You'll be staying here
in the evenings too?

55:50.839 --> 55:51.886
Of course I will.

55:52.174 --> 55:56.145
And your brother's given me
the room right next to yours.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.114
Hello?

56:08.399 --> 56:10.117
Yes, would you hold on a minute please?

56:10.401 --> 56:12.529
Nurse Higgins, it's for you.

56:16.198 --> 56:17.450
Thank you.

56:17.741 --> 56:18.788
Hello, yes?

56:19.076 --> 56:20.043
Yes, speaking.

56:21.579 --> 56:22.330
Oh no.

56:23.581 --> 56:25.504
Where did you say?

56:25.791 --> 56:27.919
Train Cross Hospital?

56:28.210 --> 56:28.836
No danger?

56:30.504 --> 56:31.255
She's 78.

56:32.423 --> 56:35.393
<i>I'll come at once, as soon as I can.</i>

56:35.676 --> 56:37.223
Nurse Higgins, is anything the matter?

56:37.511 --> 56:38.558
It's my mother.

56:38.846 --> 56:40.063
I'm afraid she's had an accident.

56:40.347 --> 56:41.564
I must go to her.

56:42.516 --> 56:44.143
What about my sister?

56:44.435 --> 56:45.732
I put her to bed under sedation.

56:46.020 --> 56:47.613
She'll sleep for hours.

56:47.896 --> 56:49.523
Look, there's a train in 20 minutes.

56:49.815 --> 56:50.907
I'll run you to the station.

56:51.191 --> 56:51.737
Thank you.

56:52.026 --> 56:53.152
<i>I'll get my b39-</i>

58:30.582 --> 58:31.674
Hello, love.

58:32.960 --> 58:33.711
<i>. Lucy-</i>

58:35.587 --> 58:37.260
How did you get in here?

58:37.548 --> 58:39.266
It wasn't easy.

58:39.550 --> 58:41.518
I've been waiting ever
since you came home.

58:41.802 --> 58:42.519
Where?

58:42.803 --> 58:43.725
In the garage.

58:44.012 --> 58:45.605
That's where I phoned in from.

58:45.889 --> 58:46.685
Phoned'?

58:46.974 --> 58:49.068
To get them out of the house.

58:49.351 --> 58:53.322
I knew he'd be gentlemen enough
to drive her to the station.

58:55.566 --> 58:56.533
Well?

58:56.817 --> 58:58.114
Aren't you glad to see me?

58:58.402 --> 58:59.654
Of course I am.

58:59.945 --> 59:01.447
What if he finds you here?

59:01.739 --> 59:02.410
I know.

59:02.698 --> 59:05.668
That's why we have to work quickly.

59:05.951 --> 59:07.123
I don't understand.

59:07.411 --> 59:08.207
Obviously.

59:09.413 --> 59:10.835
What's the matter?

59:11.123 --> 59:13.626
Nothing, I just feel a little faint.

59:13.917 --> 59:15.760
Have you been taking those pills again?

59:16.044 --> 59:17.341
<i>" No!</i>

59:17.629 --> 59:19.506
No, that's all over with.

59:19.798 --> 59:21.141
He doesn't trust you, does he?

59:21.425 --> 59:23.393
Shutting you up like
this in a darkened room.

59:23.677 --> 59:25.145
Bringing in a nurse.

59:26.889 --> 59:29.142
She's not your nurse, you know.

59:29.433 --> 59:31.106
She's your guard.

59:31.393 --> 59:32.189
Your keeper.

59:33.562 --> 59:36.065
- But George wouldn't
do a thing like that.

59:36.356 --> 59:37.573
Oh wouldn't he?

59:40.027 --> 59:41.620
Who owns this house?

59:42.780 --> 59:44.077
Why, I do.

59:44.364 --> 59:46.958
When father died he let everything to me.

59:47.242 --> 59:50.416
And if something happened to you?

59:50.704 --> 59:52.832
Suppose George has you put away for good?

59:53.123 --> 59:54.090
He wouldn't.

59:57.252 --> 59:58.174
He couldn't.

59:59.213 --> 01:00:01.762
All he has to do is to tell the doctors

01:00:02.049 --> 01:00:03.972
that you are too difficult
to control at home.

01:00:04.259 --> 01:00:05.602
That nurse will back him up.

01:00:05.886 --> 01:00:07.513
But you know that's not true.

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.682
And what good does that do?

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:12.146
George won't listen to me.

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:13.981
He doesn't even like you to see me.

01:00:14.269 --> 01:00:15.771
That's so, isn't it?

01:00:16.063 --> 01:00:16.689
Isn't it'?!

01:00:26.365 --> 01:00:28.538
What're we going to do?

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:30.419
I've got to get you away from here

01:00:30.702 --> 01:00:32.875
and we haven't got much time.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:34.380
But if I stay with you,

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:35.917
he'll find me.

01:00:36.208 --> 01:00:37.801
Where could we go?

01:00:38.085 --> 01:00:39.257
I've thought of that.

01:00:39.545 --> 01:00:41.843
We could take a room somewhere.

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:43.347
Do you have any money?

01:00:43.632 --> 01:00:45.305
No, but you do.

01:00:45.592 --> 01:00:46.809
A hundred pounds.

01:00:47.094 --> 01:00:49.813
You put away for a new dress.

01:00:50.097 --> 01:00:52.270
How did you know that?

01:00:52.558 --> 01:00:53.855
You told me.

01:00:54.142 --> 01:00:55.485
Don't you remember?

01:00:58.105 --> 01:00:58.651
I'll get it.

01:00:58.939 --> 01:00:59.656
No hurry.

01:01:00.816 --> 01:01:02.113
You can't go now.

01:01:02.401 --> 01:01:04.028
Not in broad daylight.

01:01:04.319 --> 01:01:05.946
Somebody's bound to notice.

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:08.411
Besides, we'll need a car.

01:01:08.699 --> 01:01:09.450
Tonight,

01:01:09.741 --> 01:01:11.334
when George is asleep.

01:01:19.001 --> 01:01:20.173
Don't you worry.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.588
Just leave everything to me.

01:02:45.504 --> 01:02:46.255
Barbara?

01:03:14.366 --> 01:03:15.117
Hello'?

01:03:16.576 --> 01:03:18.078
Yes, Nurse Higgins.

01:03:19.913 --> 01:03:20.755
<i>She wasn't'?</i>

01:03:21.873 --> 01:03:23.466
That's very strange.

01:03:24.418 --> 01:03:27.046
But you will be back tonight.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:27.883
Good.

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:30.094
Now there's a late train
getting in at 10 o'clock.

01:03:30.382 --> 01:03:32.680
Take a taxi from the station.

01:03:32.968 --> 01:03:33.514
Splendid.

01:03:33.802 --> 01:03:35.770
I'll expect you then.

01:03:36.054 --> 01:03:37.306
Good bye.

01:04:13.842 --> 01:04:14.718
Come on, love.

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:16.307
Wake up.

01:04:16.595 --> 01:04:17.562
Hurry up. Get dressed.

01:04:17.846 --> 01:04:18.972
It's time to go.

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:21.562
Quiet, not so loud.

01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:22.646
He'll hear you.

01:04:22.934 --> 01:04:23.651
<i>George?</i>

01:04:23.935 --> 01:04:26.108
I got some of that
sedative they had for you.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:28.194
Put it in his tea.

01:04:28.482 --> 01:04:29.574
Will he sleep?

01:04:29.858 --> 01:04:33.829
- He didn't even feel it
when I took his car keys.

01:04:36.448 --> 01:04:37.449
And Miss Higgins?

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.493
By the time she gets here we'll be gone.

01:04:39.785 --> 01:04:41.128
Come on now.

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:42.583
There.

01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:44.589
You go and get dressed.

01:04:44.873 --> 01:04:46.295
Are you okay, love?

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:47.550
Yes.

01:04:47.834 --> 01:04:50.007
Yes, just a touch of nerves.

01:04:50.295 --> 01:04:51.922
I guess I'm not used
to so much excitement.

01:04:52.214 --> 01:04:54.012
Oh, I love excitement.

01:04:59.387 --> 01:05:00.980
Here we are.

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.311
Just the thing.

01:05:03.892 --> 01:05:05.610
What do you want with those?

01:05:05.894 --> 01:05:07.737
To cut the phone cord, silly.

01:05:08.021 --> 01:05:10.615
We don't want old Miss
Higgins giving alarm,

01:05:10.899 --> 01:05:11.525
now do we?

01:05:12.526 --> 01:05:13.823
You do think of everything.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.322
I try to.

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:18.160
Now you hurry and get dressed

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.542
and I'll go down the hall and...

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:26.878
Remember, I expect to find
you dressed when I get back.

01:05:31.169 --> 01:05:31.920
<i>L s8)”</i>

01:05:33.255 --> 01:05:34.006
What?

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:37.968
It is a laugh, isn't it'?

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.728
Just like old times.

01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:49.627
What are you doing?

01:06:49.915 --> 01:06:51.258
Give them to me.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:52.337
I can't.

01:06:52.626 --> 01:06:53.923
I need them.

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.633
Give them to me!

01:06:55.921 --> 01:06:57.594
Please Lucy, one more.

01:06:57.881 --> 01:07:00.634
- I am not going to
watch you ruin yourself.

01:07:00.926 --> 01:07:03.099
Just one more, Lucy, then I promise.

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:05.639
- I thought you said
you weren't taking them.

01:07:05.931 --> 01:07:07.228
I can't help it.

01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:10.985
You mean you don't want to help it.

01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:12.521
You always had a choice.

01:07:12.812 --> 01:07:14.064
George or the pills.

01:07:14.356 --> 01:07:16.905
Me or the pills and the pills always win.

01:07:17.192 --> 01:07:19.695
Deep down inside you hate George.

01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:22.326
You hate me.

01:07:22.614 --> 01:07:23.581
No.

01:07:23.865 --> 01:07:26.243
No Lucy, you're my best friend!

01:07:27.369 --> 01:07:29.371
These are your friends.

01:07:30.705 --> 01:07:32.707
Your only friends.

01:07:32.999 --> 01:07:35.593
Oh, I'm goo enough for you
when you're in trouble,

01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:37.550
but I've never been good enough for George

01:07:37.837 --> 01:07:40.135
or anyone else you know.

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:43.768
Now I can't even win over
a hand full of these.

01:07:44.052 --> 01:07:44.678
No.

01:07:49.182 --> 01:07:51.401
What I have done for you today

01:07:51.685 --> 01:07:53.437
you'll never know

01:07:53.728 --> 01:07:55.196
and it isn't enough.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:57.616
I'm getting out.

01:07:57.899 --> 01:07:58.775
NOW!

01:07:59.067 --> 01:07:59.738
No, Lucy!

01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:06.249
You want these?

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.497
Here.

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:09.456
Take them!

01:08:14.374 --> 01:08:15.125
<i>. Lucy-</i>

01:08:20.212 --> 01:08:20.964
Lucy?

01:08:23.258 --> 01:08:24.555
Lucy?

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:30.932
Lucy!

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:39.774
Lucy, come back!

01:08:43.111 --> 01:08:44.112
Barbara, what are you doing out of-

01:08:44.404 --> 01:08:45.246
I've got to go out.

01:08:45.529 --> 01:08:46.281
At this time of night?

01:08:46.573 --> 01:08:47.415
Yes! You don't understand.

01:08:47.698 --> 01:08:48.245
It's Lucy.

01:08:48.533 --> 01:08:49.125
Lucy?

01:08:49.408 --> 01:08:50.126
Yes, she just left.

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:51.502
I heard the car pull away.

01:08:51.786 --> 01:08:53.332
That was the car I came in.

01:08:53.621 --> 01:08:55.544
There's no one out here.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:56.457
No one.

01:08:59.252 --> 01:09:01.175
Then she's still here.

01:09:06.593 --> 01:09:07.970
Where's your brother?

01:09:08.261 --> 01:09:10.138
In the study I suppose.

01:09:12.432 --> 01:09:13.183
George?

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.102
George?

01:09:50.345 --> 01:09:51.095
Barbara?

01:09:53.348 --> 01:09:54.099
Barbara?

01:10:21.292 --> 01:10:22.635
There, Barbara.

01:10:23.962 --> 01:10:25.214
Now you're free.

01:10:26.131 --> 01:10:27.724
Free of all of them.

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:41.480
- Now do you understand
why I must see a lawyer?

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:44.194
They said I killed them.

01:10:44.482 --> 01:10:47.736
They say my fingerprints
are on the shears.

01:10:48.027 --> 01:10:49.244
But it was Lucy.

01:10:49.529 --> 01:10:50.655
Lucy who did it.

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:55.202
What does Lucy have to say about that?

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:58.793
Why don't you ask her yourself?

01:11:00.123 --> 01:11:01.921
She's here with us now.

01:11:02.959 --> 01:11:03.710
Where?

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:09.762
There she is.

01:11:11.217 --> 01:11:12.639
Don't you see her?

01:11:14.846 --> 01:11:16.268
Don't you see her?

01:11:18.391 --> 01:11:20.064
Don't you see her?

01:11:30.862 --> 01:11:33.581
- Was there a George and
a Miss Higgins murdered?

01:11:33.865 --> 01:11:36.118
There may have been.

01:11:36.409 --> 01:11:37.376
But no Lucy?

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:41.673
There may not have even been a Barbara.

01:11:43.041 --> 01:11:46.011
Meaning she might be Dr. Starr?

01:11:46.294 --> 01:11:48.137
No, I don't think so.

01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:51.300
I don't think I've met Dr. Starr yet.

01:11:52.217 --> 01:11:55.016
Maybe there is no such person.

01:11:55.303 --> 01:11:57.681
Perhaps your Dr. Rutherford
is just playing a game.

01:11:57.972 --> 01:12:01.351
Dr. Rutherford never plays games.

01:12:01.643 --> 01:12:03.441
How many more are there for me to see?

01:12:03.728 --> 01:12:04.695
Just one.

01:12:04.979 --> 01:12:05.901
And then my choice?

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:07.862
Then the choice.

01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:10.527
Tell me about this one.

01:12:10.818 --> 01:12:13.196
He calls himself Byron.

01:12:13.488 --> 01:12:14.114
Dr. Byron.

01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:21.121
BWOn?

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:26.172
Gentlemen.

01:12:28.419 --> 01:12:31.218
I brought Dr. Martin to see you.

01:12:31.506 --> 01:12:34.555
- It's always a pleasure
to meet a colleague.

01:12:34.842 --> 01:12:36.139
You're a doctor?

01:12:37.845 --> 01:12:39.643
Indeed I am, sir.

01:12:39.931 --> 01:12:40.807
Physician,

01:12:41.099 --> 01:12:44.399
neurosurgeon and orthopedic specialist.

01:12:44.686 --> 01:12:48.065
And, lately I found
still another vocation.

01:12:51.109 --> 01:12:52.861
Even more fascinating.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.039
Do you care to see some of my recent work?

01:12:56.322 --> 01:12:57.665
Yes, I'd be happy to.

01:12:57.949 --> 01:13:01.419
- If you'd be good
enough to step over here.

01:13:06.708 --> 01:13:07.675
Hmm.

01:13:07.959 --> 01:13:10.257
Who are the subjects?

01:13:10.545 --> 01:13:12.639
Former colleagues of mine.

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:15.846
Of course, I had to model
their faces from memory.

01:13:16.134 --> 01:13:16.930
Quite a hobby.

01:13:17.218 --> 01:13:18.936
Oh, it's more than a hobby.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.563
Much more.

01:13:20.847 --> 01:13:23.350
These are not ordinary figures.

01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:25.609
The eyes were made to see.

01:13:27.562 --> 01:13:30.281
Inside each skull is a
perfectly proportioned brain,

01:13:30.565 --> 01:13:32.863
perfectly capable of functioning.

01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:34.744
- You talk about them as
though they were alive.

01:13:35.028 --> 01:13:35.654
Hmm.

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:37.572
That's the final step.

01:13:39.532 --> 01:13:41.955
From play things to creations.

01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:45.121
Living creations.

01:13:45.413 --> 01:13:46.881
I know it sounds a bit...

01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:51.427
But you see, the bible
tells us that the Lord God

01:13:51.711 --> 01:13:54.260
formed the man from the dust of the ground

01:13:54.547 --> 01:13:56.720
and he breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life.

01:13:57.008 --> 01:13:59.010
Thus, the man became the living creature.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:01.145
Do you believe that, doctor?

01:14:01.429 --> 01:14:02.931
I'm afraid I put my belief in science.

01:14:03.222 --> 01:14:03.848
So do I.

01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:07.189
If I could breathe my...

01:14:07.477 --> 01:14:10.276
consciousness into one of these figures,

01:14:10.563 --> 01:14:12.657
that figure will come alive.

01:14:14.359 --> 01:14:17.283
Want to see what I'm working on now?

01:14:21.949 --> 01:14:24.043
Call it my final creation.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.337
That's your face.

01:14:27.622 --> 01:14:28.168
Mhmm.

01:14:28.456 --> 01:14:29.457
My face and inside, my body,

01:14:29.749 --> 01:14:31.797
correct to the smallest detail.

01:14:32.085 --> 01:14:34.133
I can turn it in and you can say,

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.798
"Oh yes, it operates on batteries."

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.060
But how do you know what it is inside?

01:14:41.719 --> 01:14:43.062
What is it?

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:44.438
It's me.

01:14:44.722 --> 01:14:45.848
I mean, not yet.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:48.856
But it will be.

01:14:49.769 --> 01:14:51.316
Through the power of concentration

01:14:51.604 --> 01:14:54.824
I'll shall will my mind to enter its body

01:14:56.109 --> 01:14:58.237
and it will be me.

01:14:58.528 --> 01:14:59.996
Rutherford wouldn't believe I could do it.

01:15:00.279 --> 01:15:01.075
He locked me up,

01:15:01.364 --> 01:15:03.492
but he let me keep my dolls.

01:15:04.575 --> 01:15:07.328
Occupational therapy he called it.

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.248
He'll soon find out what they are.

01:15:13.459 --> 01:15:15.427
That's right, go.

01:15:15.712 --> 01:15:19.808
Run away and hide from the truth
like that idiot downstairs.

01:15:20.091 --> 01:15:21.138
But it won't do any good you know.

01:15:21.426 --> 01:15:22.678
You can tell Rutherford for me.

01:15:22.969 --> 01:15:26.064
Tell him the truth will find him out!

01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:26.973
Tell him!

01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:35.902
Well?

01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:36.986
Which is it?

01:15:38.609 --> 01:15:39.826
Would you mind stepping into your office

01:15:40.111 --> 01:15:42.739
and telling the doctor that
I'm ready to come down?

01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:44.122
No need.

01:15:44.407 --> 01:15:46.034
I'll use the intercom.

01:15:49.412 --> 01:15:50.334
What do you want me to tell him?

01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:53.716
Just tell him I'm coming to see him.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.595
Dr. Martin is ready to come down, sir.

01:16:00.423 --> 01:16:01.265
Thank you for your help.

01:16:01.549 --> 01:16:02.391
Don't mention it.

01:16:02.675 --> 01:16:04.143
It was a pleasure.

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:05.053
Doctor?

01:16:07.221 --> 01:16:07.972
Good luck.

01:16:18.065 --> 01:16:18.816
So?

01:16:20.485 --> 01:16:22.487
You've seen the patients.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.533
Well, what do you think?

01:16:26.824 --> 01:16:28.792
I think it's a disgrace.

01:16:29.702 --> 01:16:32.546
This institution, the way it's run,

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:34.878
everything about it.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:38.420
Those patients, locked away by themselves,

01:16:38.711 --> 01:16:39.837
lost in their own fantasies

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.348
and no attempt made to
bring them back to reality.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:45.806
You forget, they're incurable.

01:16:46.093 --> 01:16:47.720
Take a man like Byron.

01:16:49.263 --> 01:16:52.142
You think you could rid
him of his delusions?

01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:53.650
I'd be willing to try!

01:16:53.935 --> 01:16:55.687
And you'd fail.

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:58.527
Byron is hopelessly insane.

01:17:47.947 --> 01:17:52.043
There's only one way to
remove Byron's hallucinations.

01:17:56.289 --> 01:17:57.131
With this.

01:17:57.415 --> 01:17:58.667
Prefrontal lobotomy?

01:17:58.958 --> 01:17:59.959
Exactly.

01:18:00.251 --> 01:18:01.252
Do you believe that surgery

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:04.172
is a substitute for psychiatry?

01:18:04.463 --> 01:18:05.680
It's affective.

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:07.763
Yes, it's affective,

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:12.601
in turning intelligent human
beings into vegetables.

01:21:00.347 --> 01:21:01.098
And now,

01:21:02.767 --> 01:21:04.394
your choice.

01:21:04.685 --> 01:21:06.858
- You'd still give me the job
in spite of our differences?

01:21:07.146 --> 01:21:09.114
If you choose correctly.

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:12.656
Might do some good here.

01:21:15.613 --> 01:21:16.535
Your choice?

01:21:25.498 --> 01:21:26.215
Your tea, doctor.

01:21:26.499 --> 01:21:27.876
Thank you, nurse.

01:21:32.922 --> 01:21:33.673
Sugar?

01:21:35.049 --> 01:21:35.800
Nothing.

01:21:37.051 --> 01:21:39.019
I'm going back to London.

01:21:40.971 --> 01:21:42.973
You won't choose'?

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:43.811
No

01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:48.696
- I'm
disappointed in you, Martin.

01:21:48.979 --> 01:21:49.480
Why?

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:51.240
Because I refuse to play games with you?

01:21:51.524 --> 01:21:53.276
Because you admit defeat.

01:21:53.567 --> 01:21:54.238
Defeat?

01:21:54.527 --> 01:21:56.404
You can't identify Dr. Starr,

01:21:56.695 --> 01:21:58.493
that's why you're leaving, isn't it?

01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:00.249
Because you failed the test.

01:22:00.533 --> 01:22:02.001
Test?

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:03.001
I'm not a school boy.

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:04.457
I'm a qualified doctor.

01:22:04.745 --> 01:22:06.964
- Obviously you're not
qualified to practice here.

01:22:07.248 --> 01:22:08.420
- These patients
are badly in need

01:22:08.707 --> 01:22:09.924
of proper therapy.

01:22:10.209 --> 01:22:10.801
You won't help them.

01:22:11.085 --> 01:22:12.632
You won't even let them help themselves.

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.137
On the contrary.

01:22:14.421 --> 01:22:17.140
I give them every opportunity
to work out their fantasies.

01:22:17.424 --> 01:22:18.346
That's wrongly.

01:22:18.634 --> 01:22:19.977
Take Byron, for example.

01:22:20.261 --> 01:22:21.808
His work is remarkable.

01:22:22.096 --> 01:22:23.313
Also dangerous.

01:22:24.348 --> 01:22:25.144
Dangerous?

01:22:25.432 --> 01:22:26.479
To himself.

01:22:26.767 --> 01:22:29.190
Perhaps it's time I put an end to it

01:22:29.478 --> 01:22:30.570
and destroy his figures.

01:22:30.855 --> 01:22:32.107
That may make him even worse.

01:22:32.398 --> 01:22:33.900
Or cure him.

01:22:37.278 --> 01:22:38.746
Yes, I think the time has come

01:22:39.029 --> 01:22:41.282
to take Byron's toys away from him.

01:23:54.021 --> 01:23:54.772
<i>_ Byron!</i>

01:23:57.775 --> 01:24:00.119
I was in my office

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:01.904
when he cried out.

01:24:02.196 --> 01:24:04.790
By the time I go to his room

01:24:05.074 --> 01:24:05.996
it was too late.

01:24:06.283 --> 01:24:07.034
He's dead.

01:24:07.326 --> 01:24:08.543
His body was...

01:24:09.703 --> 01:24:10.454
crushed.

01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:15.422
So let's see our good Byron Starr.

01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:18.588
You recognized him then, sir?

01:24:18.879 --> 01:24:20.005
It was obvious.

01:24:20.297 --> 01:24:21.139
Where are you going?

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:22.800
To call the police.

01:24:23.092 --> 01:24:24.469
Is there a phone in your office?

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.558
Don't go in there sir!

01:24:36.355 --> 01:24:37.106
No.

01:24:48.909 --> 01:24:50.661
He's been strangled.

01:24:52.079 --> 01:24:53.251
Two days ago.

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.254
There was no opportunity to dispose of it.

01:24:56.542 --> 01:24:57.088
Dispose of it?

01:24:57.376 --> 01:24:58.673
Who is he?

01:24:58.961 --> 01:25:00.554
His name was Max...

01:25:00.838 --> 01:25:01.555
Reynolds.

01:25:01.839 --> 01:25:03.512
The orderly?

01:25:08.554 --> 01:25:10.022
Yes.

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:12.980
I'm afraid your guess was wrong.

01:25:13.267 --> 01:25:14.314
I am Dr. Starr.

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:12.636
Good afternoon.

01:27:12.928 --> 01:27:13.724
Good afternoon.

01:27:14.012 --> 01:27:15.639
I've come about the appointment.

01:27:15.931 --> 01:27:17.558
Yes, I was expecting you.

01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:18.897
Do come in.

01:27:19.184 --> 01:27:19.980
Thank you.

01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:25.658
- Better keep the door closed
and keep out the drafts,

01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:27.818
<i>as Dr. Starr used to say.</i>
