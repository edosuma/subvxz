00:03.896 --> 00:06.479
(upbeat music)

00:07.689 --> 00:09.005
- [Narrator] Many things
have to come together

00:09.005 --> 00:11.195
to make a delicious pizza.

00:11.195 --> 00:12.856
You need fresh ingredients handled

00:12.856 --> 00:15.387
with care by skilled hands.

00:15.387 --> 00:18.948
And don't forget the most
important ingredient of all,

00:18.948 --> 00:23.638
the finest marijuana known
to man, Jamaican goddess.

00:23.638 --> 00:25.510
The goddess becomes purified

00:25.510 --> 00:28.118
and liquified until it's just right.

00:28.118 --> 00:29.188
That's right.

00:29.188 --> 00:31.528
It's in the sauce, bitch.
(record scratching)

00:31.528 --> 00:34.603
- Listen, slut, I can
call you that, right?

00:34.603 --> 00:36.840
- Your fucking face is
like a car accident.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.088
It's just so grotesque and tragic

00:39.088 --> 00:42.426
but I cannot fucking stop looking away.

00:42.426 --> 00:44.601
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Oh!

00:44.601 --> 00:45.596
- [Narrator] This is Ariel

00:45.596 --> 00:48.246
and today's her first
day at Phu King Pizza.

00:48.246 --> 00:49.629
- Oh hell no!
- Oh, hey!

00:49.629 --> 00:51.009
(chairs rumbling)

00:51.009 --> 00:53.592
(mellow music)

00:54.981 --> 00:55.814
- Hi.

00:57.012 --> 00:58.562
Welcome to Phu King Pizza.

00:58.562 --> 00:59.803
I'm Gus.

00:59.803 --> 01:02.701
I'm the manager.
(celery crunching)

01:02.701 --> 01:04.896
So our business is growing faster

01:04.896 --> 01:07.000
than we could have ever expected.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.540
And we need a little
bit of help around here.

01:09.540 --> 01:12.196
You have to be able to adapt
to all kinds of things here.

01:12.196 --> 01:15.106
We go through everything.

01:15.106 --> 01:17.399
Wanna test your problem solving skills.

01:17.399 --> 01:20.438
Dammit, come on, get in there!

01:20.438 --> 01:23.498
Say you're stranded on a desert Island.

01:23.498 --> 01:26.130
A little bit of food, probably gonna die

01:26.130 --> 01:28.538
and you actually are
gonna die really soon.

01:28.538 --> 01:30.915
You got a boat, but it's a piece of shit.

01:30.915 --> 01:32.994
What you gonna do to get off that Island?

01:32.994 --> 01:36.820
- Well, first, probably get on the boat.

01:36.820 --> 01:38.171
- You're gonna have to talk up.

01:38.171 --> 01:41.182
I can not hear you.
(celery crunching)

01:41.182 --> 01:44.308
- Hi.
(mellow music)

01:44.308 --> 01:45.141
- Yeah.

01:46.151 --> 01:47.943
(applicant farts)

01:47.943 --> 01:51.138
You're probably gonna starve.

01:51.138 --> 01:53.456
- Well, I would gather what I could

01:53.456 --> 01:56.152
from the Island in order to fix the boat.

01:56.152 --> 01:58.985
- I think I'm just gonna die, bro.

01:59.856 --> 02:02.909
- All right, final question.

02:02.909 --> 02:06.941
Why do you want to work at Phu King Pizza?

02:06.941 --> 02:09.721
- Weird, I already work here.

02:09.721 --> 02:13.209
What's a matter with you?
(celery crunching)

02:13.209 --> 02:16.268
- Are you kidding me?
For the free pizza, man.

02:16.268 --> 02:18.929
So I can get fucked up every night.

02:18.929 --> 02:22.656
- Well, I, I think pizza
makes everyone happy

02:22.656 --> 02:26.486
and I mean everyone says that
you guys have the best pizza

02:26.486 --> 02:31.069
out there and I just, I think
it'd be fun to work here.

02:32.194 --> 02:36.248
- Well, I can go with my
instincts on this one.

02:36.248 --> 02:37.226
I got a hunch.

02:37.226 --> 02:39.231
Ariel, I know you've
never had a job before

02:39.231 --> 02:42.107
but I'm gonna give you a chance.

02:42.107 --> 02:44.128
Can you start tomorrow?

02:44.128 --> 02:46.711
(upbeat music)

03:14.334 --> 03:17.501
(alarm clock buzzing)

03:23.871 --> 03:26.538
(shoe slapping)

03:29.653 --> 03:30.822
- What the fuck dad?

03:30.822 --> 03:32.136
Get your crotch out of my face.

03:32.136 --> 03:33.823
- [Dad] Hey, I'm up.

03:33.823 --> 03:34.867
You should be up too.

03:34.867 --> 03:36.450
Learn it, let's go.

03:37.562 --> 03:42.562
(upbeat music)
(buttons clicking)

04:08.445 --> 04:09.947
- Good morning, sleepy head.

04:09.947 --> 04:10.780
- Hey.

04:11.662 --> 04:13.934
- Are you hungry, sweetie?

04:13.934 --> 04:15.484
- I'm good, thanks.
- Yeah?

04:15.484 --> 04:16.852
- Yeah, I'll just have some coffee.

04:16.852 --> 04:19.636
- I'm gonna make you some coffee.

04:19.636 --> 04:20.469
- Okay.

04:24.386 --> 04:25.219
'Sup?

04:30.804 --> 04:34.070
- [Stepmom] Here you go, sweetie.

04:34.070 --> 04:34.903
- Thanks.

04:40.093 --> 04:42.784
- Sweetie, it's been three
months since the wedding,

04:42.784 --> 04:44.451
you can call me mom.

04:45.579 --> 04:46.662
- Right, mom.

04:48.714 --> 04:50.838
It's not weird at all.

04:50.838 --> 04:52.900
(hand slapping)
Ow!

04:52.900 --> 04:55.150
So, still looking for work?

04:56.055 --> 04:57.500
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.619
And once I find a job, you
can go back to college.

05:01.619 --> 05:03.615
My son, the doctor.

05:03.615 --> 05:04.782
- I like that.

05:05.954 --> 05:07.884
- Anyway, I don't know,

05:07.884 --> 05:09.543
I might change majors when I go back.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.897
I was thinking of switching to botany.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.507
- Oh no son.

05:14.507 --> 05:16.604
You don't wanna be that kind of doctor.

05:16.604 --> 05:17.784
Olga had that down to her face

05:17.784 --> 05:20.294
and she can't express emotions anymore.

05:20.294 --> 05:24.627
Before she was all natural,
and now she's all stiff.

05:26.376 --> 05:28.726
- I think you're talking about Botox.

05:28.726 --> 05:33.014
Botany is the study of
plants and who the hell,

05:33.014 --> 05:33.921
who the hell's Olga?

05:33.921 --> 05:36.754
- Olga was a town whore back home.

05:38.542 --> 05:43.476
- Yep, all right, well, I
gotta go guys, so, catch ya.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.309
- Bye.

05:45.338 --> 05:48.740
- Okay, thanks for showing up today guys.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.111
I know you're gonna have
some questions for me

05:50.111 --> 05:52.557
but please try and hold, save for the end.

05:52.557 --> 05:54.090
I know it's very confusing,

05:54.090 --> 05:57.993
it's a big deal, but you guys
just wait till the end, okay?

05:57.993 --> 05:58.912
First of all, what's your name?

05:58.912 --> 06:00.375

06:02.779 --> 06:05.177

06:05.177 --> 06:06.010
- Are you sure?

06:06.010 --> 06:07.008
Oh, oh, okay.

06:07.008 --> 06:08.521
- Am I sure what?

06:08.521 --> 06:09.605
- That's your name? Chad?

06:09.605 --> 06:11.708
I never met nobody with-

06:11.708 --> 06:13.541
- Right, right, right.

06:14.548 --> 06:15.881
- Chad and Will.

06:16.842 --> 06:19.616
Today is gonna be kinda like an audition.

06:19.616 --> 06:20.449
This is a big deal.

06:20.449 --> 06:23.477
I want you guys to know that
both of you are gonna get paid

06:23.477 --> 06:27.232
for today, but only one
of you can keep your job,

06:27.232 --> 06:29.126
kinda like an audition, okay?

06:29.126 --> 06:31.493
You guys are gonna be battle royaling

06:31.493 --> 06:33.910
for your lives and your jobs.

06:35.345 --> 06:38.122
Whoever does the best job gets to stay.

06:38.122 --> 06:40.413
You got a job for the rest of your life

06:40.413 --> 06:42.784

(Chad laughing)

06:42.784 --> 06:43.867
- Okay?
- Bam!

06:45.083 --> 06:47.945
Huh, huh, huh?
- Oh, hell no.

06:47.945 --> 06:50.915
- Phu King bullshit
marketing plan is this?

06:50.915 --> 06:53.286
- Best Phu King marketing ever.

06:53.286 --> 06:57.786
Go do your job, see what you
can do to make it happen.

06:59.195 --> 07:00.952
Impress me, guys, I'm
gonna be watching you

07:00.952 --> 07:01.789
throughout the day.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.039
I wanna see some serious spinning guys.

07:06.639 --> 07:08.330
Fucking idiot amateurs.

07:08.330 --> 07:10.997
(water running)

07:12.710 --> 07:14.728
(pots clanging)

07:14.728 --> 07:18.895
(lady speaks in foreign language)

07:20.478 --> 07:21.728
- I don't know.

07:23.011 --> 07:24.811
- Yes, mom, I'm up.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.625
Hi, I love you too by the way.

07:26.625 --> 07:30.792
(lady speaks in foreign language)

07:37.417 --> 07:39.759
Can you tell her to relax please?

07:39.759 --> 07:41.444
- Phu, calm down.
(speaks in foreign language)

07:41.444 --> 07:45.611
(lady speaks in foreign language)

07:51.431 --> 07:53.433
- Man, what's her problem?

07:53.433 --> 07:56.051
- Does she know about your money problem?

07:56.051 --> 07:58.610
- I told you, dad, I got
that taken care of, okay?

07:58.610 --> 08:00.759
I just had to change some things around,

08:00.759 --> 08:02.764
but it's all good now.

08:02.764 --> 08:04.276
- I hope so, Thomas,

08:04.276 --> 08:07.003
I know about you, you're
gonna shut me down.

08:07.003 --> 08:08.391
- I got this, all right?

08:08.391 --> 08:09.224
All right.

08:10.287 --> 08:11.580
That dough looking kinda dry, dad,

08:11.580 --> 08:14.129
you might wanna add some
cream or I don't know.

08:14.129 --> 08:16.279
Siri, call me daddy.

08:16.279 --> 08:19.859
- [Siri] Okay, but I already
call you daddy, daddy.

08:19.859 --> 08:20.859
- Hell yeah.

08:21.973 --> 08:24.783
- Hey, do I know you?
- No.

08:24.783 --> 08:26.616
- Lucero, the milkman.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.756
- No, that's not me.
- Yeah.

08:31.106 --> 08:33.637
Do your fucking job!
(man barks)

08:33.637 --> 08:34.810
- What the fuck?

08:34.810 --> 08:36.825
- Do your fucking job, bitches.

08:36.825 --> 08:37.742
- Oh, hell.

08:38.737 --> 08:41.620
That was one scary fuck, just.
- Yes.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.297
- Motherfucker, I got kids
and shit on my head later.

08:44.297 --> 08:46.964
(curious music)

08:51.349 --> 08:55.117
- Hey, Gus.
- Hey, what's up, my homie?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.978
- Gus, we've been over this man.

08:57.978 --> 08:59.733
Can't just go around and
call someone homie all right?

08:59.733 --> 09:01.703
Not unless you're in a gang.
- Right.

09:01.703 --> 09:04.370
Sorry. So I hired a new trainee.

09:05.426 --> 09:06.259
Why don't you go train?
- Seriously?

09:06.259 --> 09:07.567
- Yeah, she's over in the dining room.

09:07.567 --> 09:08.509
Just show her the ropes.

09:08.509 --> 09:09.753
Go slow with her though.

09:09.753 --> 09:11.041
This is her first job.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.477
- Her first job?
- Yeah.

09:12.477 --> 09:14.737
- Why would you hire someone
with zero experience, man?

09:14.737 --> 09:16.719
- I had a feeling she'd be a good addition

09:16.719 --> 09:18.552
to the team, you know?

09:19.503 --> 09:20.336
- I guess.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.493
- Damn you.

09:23.493 --> 09:24.423
Damn you straight to hell,

09:24.423 --> 09:27.340
don't fucking question me, asshole.

09:29.587 --> 09:32.337

09:41.597 --> 09:44.743
- So, you're the new hire, huh?

- Yeah, hi, I'm Ariel.

09:46.948 --> 09:47.781

09:51.383 --> 09:52.550

huge fans of the movie.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.934
- Ah, like it.
- Thanks.

10:04.195 --> 10:06.574
- So is it fucking pizza?

10:06.574 --> 10:10.308

Fu King, Phu King Pizza.

10:10.308 --> 10:11.141
But, I mean it's cool,

toilets for the rest of the day.

10:19.874 --> 10:20.714
You know?

10:20.714 --> 10:23.163
It's basically what you'll
be doing every day forever.

10:23.163 --> 10:24.334
I'm fucking with you.
- Okay.

10:24.334 --> 10:26.141
- That's cool.

10:26.141 --> 10:27.962
No, I'm just gonna take you out back

10:39.941 --> 10:43.053
Yeah, and the dustbins for
the trash is back over there.

10:43.053 --> 10:45.053
And, oh, what's up guys?

10:47.419 --> 10:48.919
Speaking of trash.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.548
- 'Sup.
- 'Sup, dog, 'sup, dog.

10:52.548 --> 10:54.264
Oh everybody, this is
our newest team member.

10:54.264 --> 10:56.007
This is Ariel.
- Hi.

10:56.007 --> 10:57.256
- Ariel, this is our notorious

10:57.256 --> 10:59.209
and infamous delivery driver group.

10:59.209 --> 11:00.878
This is Jasmine.

11:00.878 --> 11:01.711
Charlie.

11:03.768 --> 11:05.934
That's that's Cujo.

11:05.934 --> 11:08.424
- Why do they call you Cujo?

11:08.424 --> 11:09.931
- Glad you asked.

11:09.931 --> 11:13.918
They call me Cujo because I
only like to do it doggy style,

11:13.918 --> 11:15.918
exclusively doggy style.

11:18.143 --> 11:21.063
I also tend to foam at the
mouth when I'm about to cum.

11:21.063 --> 11:21.896
Psh.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.245
- You fucking dip shit.

11:25.245 --> 11:26.078
Have some manners.

Thanks, Firefly.

14:59.614 --> 15:01.099
- I, but you,

15:01.099 --> 15:02.414

15:02.414 --> 15:03.497

15:04.786 --> 15:06.896
Gus isn't even that stupid.

15:06.896 --> 15:08.087
- Security cameras,

15:08.087 --> 15:08.977
security cameras would have caught it.

15:08.977 --> 15:10.075
- That's not gonna, I didn't.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.495
I never got the security cameras fixed.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.660

15:30.714 --> 15:31.874

19:39.792 --> 19:40.957
You're professional now.

19:40.957 --> 19:42.605
(Playa Playa laughs)

19:42.605 --> 19:45.009
- Ah, you're cute, man. I am professional.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.346
That's exactly why it's not personal.

19:47.346 --> 19:48.749
Business is business.

19:48.749 --> 19:51.203
You guys better have
my 20 large by tonight

19:51.203 --> 19:55.453
or I'll fucking have you
both killed and that's it.

19:57.202 --> 19:58.535
- Coming inside?

19:59.557 --> 20:00.390
- Not yet.

20:01.383 --> 20:03.178
- All right, well,

20:03.178 --> 20:04.303
I have to get back on the floor.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.136
Supposed to be training Ariel, so.

20:08.098 --> 20:09.098
See ya, man.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.562
- We about to die soon

20:16.562 --> 20:20.122
and this man got pussy on the brain.

20:20.122 --> 20:21.188
I'm so proud.

20:21.188 --> 20:22.338
- - yes, I'll take one severe, please.

20:22.338 --> 20:23.621
- [Gus] Great, that'll be $25.

20:23.621 --> 20:25.200
- All right, thank you.
- All right, thank you.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.033
Have a good one.

20:26.033 --> 20:26.866
Come back and see us.

20:26.866 --> 20:30.144
Anthony, hey.
- What, Gus, man, the hair.

20:30.144 --> 20:30.977
- Oh, sorry.

20:30.977 --> 20:34.223
Where's Thomas?
- He's out back.

20:34.223 --> 20:39.223
(dogs barking)
(western music)

20:51.340 --> 20:52.409
- I'm gonna do it.

20:52.409 --> 20:53.409
Hey, Shorty,

20:54.699 --> 20:56.658
man, what was all that shuffling coil talk

20:56.658 --> 20:57.802
shit earlier, man?

20:57.802 --> 20:59.624
- It's from Shakespeare's "Hamlet."

20:59.624 --> 21:01.219
- Wow!

21:01.219 --> 21:06.157
Shakespeare, you art the artist
of hard to understand, man.

21:06.157 --> 21:07.717
- It's not hard to understand.

21:07.717 --> 21:09.907
Shakespeare is very beautiful and shit.

21:09.907 --> 21:10.883
I like it.

21:10.883 --> 21:12.294
You never know, I may
become an actor one day

21:12.294 --> 21:13.373
and perform Shakespeare.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.167
(both laughing)

21:16.167 --> 21:18.183
Did I say something funny?

21:18.183 --> 21:21.477
- No, Shorty.
- No, nothing funny at all.

21:21.477 --> 21:23.144
- I didn't think so.

21:24.432 --> 21:26.483
I must say I'm in a mood today.

21:26.483 --> 21:27.415
Those two pizza boys are dead

21:27.415 --> 21:29.002
no matter what Playa Playa says.

21:29.002 --> 21:32.057
- Yo, Playa Playa say
we can't just kill 'em,

21:32.057 --> 21:34.230
then we can't just go
over there in the store,

21:34.230 --> 21:38.200
blasting everybody away, taking
brains out of people heads.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.350
- By my sword, I swear there
is no power in the tongue

21:41.350 --> 21:42.933
of man to alter me.

21:44.645 --> 21:47.228
Oh, come on, nothing? That's
from "The Merchant Of Venice."

21:47.228 --> 21:49.197
- I knew that shit, I knew
it, Shorty, I got you.

21:49.197 --> 21:51.441
- I knew that.
- Shh.

21:51.441 --> 21:52.808
I feel like leaving an ominous message

21:52.808 --> 21:55.757
for our two favorite pizza guys.

21:55.757 --> 21:57.481
- What, ominous, ominous?
- Is that,

21:57.481 --> 22:01.962
Is that like giving them a
note of something, Shorty?

22:01.962 --> 22:03.447
♪ Come to the show, then
you know what I mean ♪

22:03.447 --> 22:05.575
♪ Big cloud in the back ♪
(hand slapping)

22:05.575 --> 22:06.658
- What, mom, I wasn't-

22:06.658 --> 22:08.810
(mom speaks in foreign language)

22:08.810 --> 22:12.133
Okay.
(speaks in foreign language)

22:12.133 --> 22:13.598
Okay!

22:13.598 --> 22:17.765
(mom speaks in foreign language)

22:23.533 --> 22:26.002
- [Client] Thanks for
the straight pepperoni.

22:26.002 --> 22:26.835
- Oh damn.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.560
- Who's that?

22:29.560 --> 22:32.109
- Sir Thomas's parents,
yeah, they own Phu King.

22:32.109 --> 22:33.746
This place is named after his mom.

22:33.746 --> 22:34.597
They actually own the business,

22:34.597 --> 22:37.312
but gave it to Thomas to run.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.829
(mom speaks in foreign language)

22:38.829 --> 22:40.514
- Hello, Mr. and Ms. King.

22:40.514 --> 22:41.978
Nice of you to join us today.

22:41.978 --> 22:45.301
(mom speaks in foreign language)

22:45.301 --> 22:47.140
- Nice to see you, Gus, how's business?

22:47.140 --> 22:48.804
- Oh, business is very good.

22:48.804 --> 22:50.261
over the last couple months.

22:50.261 --> 22:53.737
(mom speaks in foreign language)

22:53.737 --> 22:55.091
- How's Thomas been doing?

22:55.091 --> 22:57.049
- Thomas, Thomas, Thomas has been great.

22:57.049 --> 22:59.397
He's very, very pleasure to work for.

22:59.397 --> 23:01.582
He allows me the space I
need to run a tight ship.

23:01.582 --> 23:05.785
(mom speaks in foreign language)

23:05.785 --> 23:08.364
- She says, "Thank you
for your hard work, Gus."

23:08.364 --> 23:12.031
- You're very welcome,
thank you, thank you.

23:15.156 --> 23:17.382
- She seems nice.
(Anthony scoffs)

23:17.382 --> 23:18.712
- Yeah.

23:18.712 --> 23:21.879
She actually just called Gus an idiot.

23:24.893 --> 23:28.285
(Thomas yells)

23:28.285 --> 23:30.061
- Hey, dad.
- Hi, Thomas.

23:30.061 --> 23:32.544
(mom speaks in foreign language)

23:32.544 --> 23:33.377
- For what?

23:33.377 --> 23:35.289
(mom speaks in foreign language)

23:35.289 --> 23:37.981
Mom, things are better,
okay? Just trust me.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.508
(mom speaks in foreign language)

23:40.508 --> 23:42.705
- Yeah, but it's only by
like one month this time

23:42.705 --> 23:44.772
instead of four or five, like before.

23:44.772 --> 23:48.939
(mom speaks in foreign language)

24:02.090 --> 24:06.840
- You know, we used to do
million dollar worldwide deals,

24:08.062 --> 24:10.645
working with the most powerful.

24:12.675 --> 24:14.925
And we took what we wanted.

24:18.417 --> 24:19.667
Now look at us,

24:22.107 --> 24:24.690
look at us, playing with pizza.

24:26.732 --> 24:28.065
For chum change.

24:36.655 --> 24:39.084
(Shorty sighs)

24:39.084 --> 24:44.084
you know, for whatever reason,
Playa Playa has a soft spot

24:44.398 --> 24:46.731
for that stupid pizza joint.

24:49.648 --> 24:54.624
And honestly, I don't give a
shit what Playa Playa says.

24:54.624 --> 24:55.791
It ends today.

24:56.949 --> 25:00.032
- But we work for Playa Playa, right?

25:01.582 --> 25:04.662
- Yeah, if he finds out, I mean,

25:04.662 --> 25:06.465
you know how he is, Shorty.

25:06.465 --> 25:11.465
Who's gonna deal with that?
(suspenseful music)

25:14.028 --> 25:17.811
- Well, tell me then what
would you have me do?

25:17.811 --> 25:19.083
(gun firing)

25:19.083 --> 25:20.812
Seek for the patronage of some great man

25:20.812 --> 25:23.388
and like a creeping vine
and a tall tree crawl upward

25:23.388 --> 25:24.844
where I cannot stand alone?

25:24.844 --> 25:26.159
No thank you.

25:26.159 --> 25:27.983
Eat a toad for breakfast every morning,

25:27.983 --> 25:29.173
make my knees callous

25:29.173 --> 25:30.635
and cultivate a supple spine

25:30.635 --> 25:33.344
while my belly groveling in the dust?

25:33.344 --> 25:35.104
No thank you.

25:35.104 --> 25:37.361
Shall I labor night and
day and build a reputation

25:37.361 --> 25:40.361
on one song and never write another?

25:41.512 --> 25:42.852
No thank you.

25:42.852 --> 25:44.081
No, I thank you.

25:44.081 --> 25:45.664
And again, I think.

25:46.706 --> 25:51.706
(Shorty screams)
(suspenseful music)

25:53.076 --> 25:54.106
- Are you kidding me?

25:54.106 --> 25:55.687
What the?

25:55.687 --> 25:58.020
What are they fucking doing?

25:59.447 --> 26:04.114
No. Are you serious?
(suspenseful music)

26:20.802 --> 26:23.719
(knocking at door)

26:31.177 --> 26:32.570
- Come on in.

26:32.570 --> 26:33.570
- All right.

26:36.032 --> 26:37.748
- Just put the pizza down right there.

26:37.748 --> 26:38.748
- All right.

26:42.645 --> 26:45.842
- So do, the astronaut pizza is 25 bucks.

26:45.842 --> 26:48.425
- All right, oh, just a second.

26:49.559 --> 26:50.445
There you go.

26:50.445 --> 26:52.413
Keep the change there, baby.

26:52.413 --> 26:53.825
- Sticky, thanks.

26:53.825 --> 26:55.636
- Sit down and chill with me for a minute.

26:55.636 --> 26:56.636
- All right.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.911
- You wanna hit this shit?

27:01.911 --> 27:04.903
- Ma'am I always have
time for a smoke break.

27:04.903 --> 27:07.192
(both laughing)

27:07.192 --> 27:08.753
- It's not as good as
that Jamaican goddess

27:08.753 --> 27:11.004
you guys are putting in them pizzas.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.378
But it'll knock the booboo
out of you a little bit.

27:13.378 --> 27:14.544
- This shit is good though.

27:14.544 --> 27:16.081
(client laughs)
- Thanks, man.

27:16.081 --> 27:17.164
- Yeah, shit.

27:19.041 --> 27:21.596
What do you know about
that Jamaican goddess?

27:21.596 --> 27:23.847
(client laughs)
- Shit, girl.

27:23.847 --> 27:26.033
The stories I could tell you.

27:26.033 --> 27:27.681
I used to live in Jamaica.

27:27.681 --> 27:30.051
- No way.
- Yeah, when I was younger,

27:30.051 --> 27:32.701
firmer, and a whole lot tighter.

27:32.701 --> 27:34.568
(both laughing)

27:34.568 --> 27:35.841
- Well, how long was it?

27:35.841 --> 27:39.251
- Man, it was just last summer.

27:39.251 --> 27:41.371
- Well, good for you.

27:41.371 --> 27:44.912
- So, seriously now, you got a man?

27:44.912 --> 27:46.416
- You don't even wanna go there.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.467
You don't fucking wanna go there.

27:47.467 --> 27:48.703
There's this dude.

27:48.703 --> 27:49.834
He's disgusting.

27:49.834 --> 27:53.685
Just fucking gross, the
dumb ass and you know what?

27:53.685 --> 27:57.985
I like him, for some fucking
stupid reason, I like him.

27:57.985 --> 27:59.261
- Love never makes no sense, dear,

27:59.261 --> 28:00.927
- You know he pisses me off though?

28:00.927 --> 28:02.215
I try and give him hints, you know?

28:02.215 --> 28:03.362
Like I liked him.

28:03.362 --> 28:06.272
Motherfucker doesn't do anything, nothing.

28:06.272 --> 28:07.605
Clues and hints?

28:09.058 --> 28:09.975
Shit, girl.

28:12.423 --> 28:16.756
If you want a man, you gotta
reach out and grab him.

28:18.975 --> 28:21.692
(Jasmine roaring)

28:21.692 --> 28:24.442
(birds chirping)

28:32.350 --> 28:37.350
(doorbell ringing)
(elevator music)

28:39.150 --> 28:40.233
- Nice shoes.

28:42.305 --> 28:44.305
You're not the pool guy.

28:45.180 --> 28:48.410
- Oh, is the my Phu King pizza?

28:48.410 --> 28:52.629
Oh, thanks.
(lady moaning)

28:52.629 --> 28:53.462
Oh.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.958
- Dude, is that your fucking wife?

29:01.035 --> 29:02.535
She's fucking hot.

29:05.112 --> 29:06.862
- Yes, she's my wife.

29:09.422 --> 29:11.589
Go get some help, pervert.

29:13.485 --> 29:18.485
(door slamming)
(elevator music continues)

29:41.780 --> 29:43.105
- What the fuck?

29:43.105 --> 29:45.151
Yo, chief, you're blocking me here.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.663
- That piece of shit?

29:46.663 --> 29:48.084
Thought it was abandoned.

29:48.084 --> 29:50.711
Look here, Pedro, can't
get past the border,

29:50.711 --> 29:52.079
stay on your side.

29:52.079 --> 29:56.111
This is America.
(pool guy grunts)

29:56.111 --> 29:58.542
- Whatever David Duke.

29:58.542 --> 30:00.294
- David Duke? That's a good one.

30:00.294 --> 30:02.096
You got me there.

30:02.096 --> 30:03.987
- Ondalay, dude.

30:03.987 --> 30:08.070
- I'm just trying to do
a job Americans Won't do.

30:12.915 --> 30:16.362
- Hey, you guys in the movie business?

30:16.362 --> 30:18.756
- Sorta, used to be.

30:18.756 --> 30:20.780
Turns out they really sucked at it.

30:20.780 --> 30:24.200
Man, they only give you one audition.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.376
- Oh.

30:25.376 --> 30:27.183
- You do kinda look
like that Burt Reynolds

30:27.183 --> 30:29.068
from that "Deliverance" movie.

30:29.068 --> 30:32.376
- "Deliverance?" Yeah, think so?

30:32.376 --> 30:34.615
- Well, no, not really.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.951
You know, more like rich, new friends.

30:36.951 --> 30:37.934
Screw like a pig.

30:37.934 --> 30:39.377
- Fuck you, man.

30:39.377 --> 30:40.551
Whatever.

30:40.551 --> 30:44.801
Hey, I heard them fucking
pizzas got drugs in them.

30:45.860 --> 30:47.362
- No man.
- You're still here.

30:47.362 --> 30:50.346
- There's nothing illegal
here, all natural.

30:50.346 --> 30:51.763
- Fucking stoner.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.718
- Vamanos, man, come on.

30:55.648 --> 30:57.005
- The astronaut's really strong,

30:57.005 --> 30:59.597
I would suggest for first
timers a silky smooth,

30:59.597 --> 31:02.311
it's a lot more relaxed
and chill, you know?

31:02.311 --> 31:04.561
Shorty, hey, what's up man?

31:05.401 --> 31:06.543
- Where's Harold?

31:06.543 --> 31:07.376
- Who?

31:08.644 --> 31:10.700
- The Chinaman.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.003
- Oh you mean Thomas?

31:12.003 --> 31:12.836
He's not Chinese.

31:12.836 --> 31:15.115
He's actually more like
Filipino mixed with Tai.

31:15.115 --> 31:16.463
- I don't care what the heck, Linus,

31:16.463 --> 31:19.433
let's go get him and have a talk.

31:19.433 --> 31:20.516
- Okay, okay.

31:21.646 --> 31:23.547
You should stay with Gus.

31:23.547 --> 31:24.831
I'll be right back.

31:24.831 --> 31:26.581
Don't worry about it.

31:32.394 --> 31:35.248
- Hey, chill out, man! Chill.
- Chill, dude!

31:35.248 --> 31:36.084
We had an agreement!

31:36.084 --> 31:37.017
- Man, I'm taking your ass home.

31:37.017 --> 31:37.850
- Go, go!

31:38.870 --> 31:40.412

31:40.412 --> 31:42.729
Yo, what happened, dude?

31:42.729 --> 31:43.682
What the hell, Shorty?

31:43.682 --> 31:47.217
You can't come up here starting shit.

31:47.217 --> 31:48.050
Wah!

31:50.048 --> 31:51.403
- Come on, I want you to.

31:51.403 --> 31:53.382
- I'm half Tai, bro, I
know more Tai, what's up?

31:53.382 --> 31:54.887
- Okay, okay.
(Thomas heaves)

31:54.887 --> 31:56.387
- Dude, damn, man!

32:01.147 --> 32:04.120
(Shorty laughs)
- My problem,

32:04.120 --> 32:06.905
your friend has a big fucking
mouth, so I shut it for him.

32:06.905 --> 32:08.753
I don't believe you boys
understand the severity

32:08.753 --> 32:10.323
of the situation.

32:10.323 --> 32:12.000
When you don't pay Playa Playa,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.730
you're taking food away
from all this baby mamas.

32:14.730 --> 32:17.481
People die for that shit.

32:17.481 --> 32:19.459
Get up. Get the fuck up!
(men heaving)

32:19.459 --> 32:23.609
You, you took what was
supposed to be mine.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.988
- Man, we ain't take
shit from your bitch ass.

32:25.988 --> 32:28.655
(Thomas heaves)

32:30.303 --> 32:31.642
- You better not even
think of skipping town,

32:31.642 --> 32:33.475
because I'll find you.

32:36.697 --> 32:38.659
See you later.

32:38.659 --> 32:39.492
- Oh.

32:41.374 --> 32:42.568
Oh.

32:42.568 --> 32:43.485
My ovaries.

32:44.522 --> 32:47.331
Shorty's punk ass, man, I hate him.

32:47.331 --> 32:48.369
- What'd you think was
gonna happen, Thomas?

32:48.369 --> 32:50.619
You was talking shit, dude.

32:52.903 --> 32:53.736
All right, man,

32:53.736 --> 32:56.401
I've got a couple of grand saved at home.

32:56.401 --> 32:58.011
I mean, it was supposed to be for college

32:58.011 --> 33:01.843
but can't go to college if I'm dead.

33:01.843 --> 33:03.122
How about you?

33:03.122 --> 33:05.717
- If I empty out my accounts
and then sell some of my stuff,

33:05.717 --> 33:10.322
I'll probably get like
another five GS on top of it.

33:10.322 --> 33:14.090
- If we take the roughly
like I dunno like two grand,

33:14.090 --> 33:16.526
two, yeah, $2,000 that
we made today in sales,

33:16.526 --> 33:21.526
I think that's, shit, dude,
we're still 10 grand short.

33:21.655 --> 33:23.822
- Oh my God, we're fucked.

33:27.196 --> 33:28.790
- Think maybe your parents
can lend us some money?

33:28.790 --> 33:31.873
- Hah! Dude, no, oh shit, my parents!

33:33.239 --> 33:35.026
I forgot I'm supposed to get
lunch with them and Chenae,

33:35.026 --> 33:37.936
my mom's been on my ass
about introducing them.

33:37.936 --> 33:39.913
- Think they're gonna flip?

33:39.913 --> 33:42.746
- My dad will be fine, but my mom,

33:43.982 --> 33:48.149
my mom will trip, flip,
double dip, all that shit.

33:50.384 --> 33:51.521
I'll catch up with you later, man.

33:51.521 --> 33:54.188

33:55.945 --> 33:58.028

33:59.745 --> 34:02.603
Pick up, pick up, Nico, Areola,

34:02.603 --> 34:05.469

Rotch and Burgundy, sir.

34:05.469 --> 34:08.386
Pick up.
(spitting)

34:12.995 --> 34:13.964
Is there a problem, officer?

34:13.964 --> 34:15.547
- Shut the fuck up.

34:17.053 --> 34:19.216
Are you the guy from
that fucking pizza joint?

34:19.216 --> 34:21.966
- Yeah. It's pronounced Phu King.

34:23.207 --> 34:24.224
- We don't care.

34:24.224 --> 34:26.615
We ordered two two silky smooth pizzas

34:26.615 --> 34:28.865
over half an hour ago, son.

34:31.109 --> 34:32.473

34:32.473 --> 34:33.329
Okay.

34:33.329 --> 34:34.497
Yeah, yeah.

34:34.497 --> 34:35.902
Yeah, I got them right here.

34:35.902 --> 34:37.471
- Whoa! What're you reaching for?

34:37.471 --> 34:38.724
- Whoa! Put your hands behind your back!

34:38.724 --> 34:39.557
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

34:39.557 --> 34:41.721
No, no, no, no, no!

34:41.721 --> 34:42.936
No, no, no!

34:42.936 --> 34:44.655

34:44.655 --> 34:45.861
Oh, oh, oh fuck!

34:45.861 --> 34:47.844

34:57.905 --> 34:59.988

35:05.922 --> 35:07.517

35:07.517 --> 35:09.063

- Hell yeah.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.388
You have the best damn
pizza we've ever had tasted.

35:11.388 --> 35:12.221
- Woo!

35:13.401 --> 35:15.276
Just some advice.

35:15.276 --> 35:17.377
There've been a lot of local
robberies at these stores.

35:17.377 --> 35:19.397
So watch your six.

35:19.397 --> 35:21.395
- Contact us if you need anything else.

35:21.395 --> 35:23.007
Good day.

35:23.007 --> 35:23.840
- Okay.

35:44.108 --> 35:46.775
(siren wailing)

35:50.791 --> 35:53.374
- Those guys are fucking crazy.

35:55.565 --> 35:57.232
Patronizing me, man.

35:58.426 --> 36:01.009
Nobody puts Cujo in the corner.

36:07.086 --> 36:10.169

36:12.088 --> 36:13.659

36:15.492 --> 36:16.706
Sit your ass down.

36:16.706 --> 36:18.134
- You know, my Rambo's
kicking right now, babe.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.604
- Can't do this here-
- This is your sliced pizza.

36:20.604 --> 36:21.457
- Ah, thanks, sir.
- There's yours,

36:21.457 --> 36:22.662

36:25.163 --> 36:26.007

36:26.007 --> 36:27.906
- It's hard, man, we gotta go.

36:27.906 --> 36:30.302
- So when we doing this? What's the plan?

36:30.302 --> 36:31.135
- Thank you.

36:31.135 --> 36:31.968
We gotta go deal-
- We ain't doing this

36:31.968 --> 36:33.357
like subway last week, man.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.316
Thad boy in that makeup, that was stupid.

36:35.316 --> 36:36.218

36:37.481 --> 36:38.520

All right, so this is the
wall right here, right?

36:41.958 --> 36:42.791
- This wall.

36:42.791 --> 36:45.170

napkin dispenser is the wall.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.829
So put that wall right there.

36:46.829 --> 36:48.215
- Yeah. All right.
- Okay.

36:48.215 --> 36:50.931
- The cash register, the salt, right here.

36:50.931 --> 36:52.728
- The salt.
- The cash register,

36:52.728 --> 36:54.145
look, look, look.

36:55.339 --> 36:56.848

36:58.514 --> 36:59.846
- Gotcha, listening.
- Yes, man.

36:59.846 --> 37:01.028
So, at the end of the day,

37:01.028 --> 37:03.125
so what they do is, they take the money

37:03.125 --> 37:05.321
from the cash register to the back.

37:05.321 --> 37:07.106
- How you know this?

37:07.106 --> 37:08.510
- 'Cause man, the Jamaican goddess, man,

37:26.659 --> 37:29.905

the same hairdo as you,

38:46.916 --> 38:49.152

38:49.152 --> 38:52.250

38:52.250 --> 38:53.678

38:53.678 --> 38:54.693
- That one.

38:54.693 --> 38:56.905
When I ate that thing,
I felt like I landed

38:56.905 --> 38:59.491
on the moon, ran around
the ring on Saturn,

38:59.491 --> 39:02.331
found life on Mars and
then ended up on Pluto

39:02.331 --> 39:06.100
with that other astronaut,
Lance Armstrong.

39:06.100 --> 39:10.025

universal name for astronauts.

40:59.186 --> 41:01.327
- No, no.

41:01.327 --> 41:04.459

41:08.913 --> 41:11.449
Oh!
(Cujo groans)

41:11.449 --> 41:15.153
- You better not be telling nice about me.

41:15.153 --> 41:18.585
Or I'll tell everybody how
you lasted less than a minute

41:18.585 --> 41:23.585
and ended up slobbering and
foaming all over your limp dick.

41:23.799 --> 41:24.632
Dick!

I think I love that fucking bitch.

42:00.869 --> 42:05.869

(dramatic piano music)

42:09.290 --> 42:11.207
- Mom, but she's white!

42:12.179 --> 42:13.012
No reason.

42:41.314 --> 42:43.306

46:48.044 --> 46:50.094
- All right, cool.

46:50.094 --> 46:51.468
- So I have a question.

46:51.468 --> 46:52.301
What's the difference

46:52.301 --> 46:55.265
between all the pizzas that you guys sell?

46:55.265 --> 46:58.774
- Well, a couple of examples,
we have a blast from the past

46:58.774 --> 47:00.515
which gets people so high

47:00.515 --> 47:03.902
that they like see their
dead relatives and shit.

47:03.902 --> 47:04.917
And then I know, I know.

47:04.917 --> 47:06.616
And then you have the astronaut

47:06.616 --> 47:09.011
which gets you so high,
think you're up in space.

47:09.011 --> 47:10.395
- Oh.
(Ariel laughs)

47:10.395 --> 47:12.440
So do you smoke a lot?

47:12.440 --> 47:15.393
(inhaling)
(whistle sliding)

47:15.393 --> 47:17.141
(exhaling)
- No. No.

47:17.141 --> 47:18.491
I mean, not really.

47:18.491 --> 47:20.228
I mean a little, a little, a little

47:20.228 --> 47:21.579
a little more than usual,
yeah, I guess you could say.

47:21.579 --> 47:23.712
- You smoke a lot.

47:23.712 --> 47:24.545
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:24.545 --> 47:26.628
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's okay.

47:28.611 --> 47:30.917
- Listen, I have to, I have to head out.

47:30.917 --> 47:32.041
I have to run home for lunch.

47:32.041 --> 47:33.994
- But just stick around
for, with this for now

47:33.994 --> 47:35.752
and then, yeah, I shouldn't be that long.

47:35.752 --> 47:37.560
- Okay, well hurry back.
- All right, cool, come on.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.393
- Okay.

47:40.038 --> 47:40.980
- Hey, got it.

47:40.980 --> 47:43.069
Yeah, man.
- Dude, what took you so long?

47:43.069 --> 47:44.578
- I waited for Gus, he
went in the bathroom.

47:44.578 --> 47:45.411
- I didn't want him to
see I'm taking shit.

47:45.411 --> 47:46.842
- Man, what you doing?

47:46.842 --> 47:48.570
You can't just dive in a pizza.

47:48.570 --> 47:49.403
- Why not?

47:49.403 --> 47:50.456
- This ain't no piece of plastic.

47:50.456 --> 47:52.991
You just can't in it, this ain't no pool.

47:52.991 --> 47:54.074
- I know what it is, all right.

47:54.074 --> 47:55.875
- This got the Jamaican
goddess up in here.

47:55.875 --> 47:57.393
- That's right.
- So you gotta pray

47:57.393 --> 47:59.052
before you eat this pizza.
- What the fuck?

47:59.052 --> 48:00.999
- You gotta have some faith in it.

48:00.999 --> 48:01.832
- You serious?
- You, yes,

48:01.832 --> 48:02.932
you got gotta have the Holy ghost

48:02.932 --> 48:04.175

48:04.175 --> 48:06.813
So let's do a prayer, I'ma
let you start out, come on.

48:06.813 --> 48:09.728
Let's pray before that naked
mole rat come back out here.

48:09.728 --> 48:10.561
- All right.
- Come on.

48:10.561 --> 48:11.931
- All right.

48:11.931 --> 48:13.614
Oh, dear Jamaican goddess.

Thank you for shining your light on us.

Thank you Jesus.

48:27.476 --> 48:30.290
- Oh my God.
- Oh my goodness.

48:30.290 --> 48:31.216
- Thank you.

48:31.216 --> 48:33.999
(both laughing)

48:33.999 --> 48:38.833
- Once these two pizza boys
miss their deadline tonight,

48:38.833 --> 48:41.250
it'll be their last delivery.

48:47.012 --> 48:48.431
- Hey, man, Gabby wants
to know if you're hungry.

48:48.431 --> 48:51.589
She can warm up some food for you.

48:51.589 --> 48:53.948
- I'm not really hungry, thanks.

48:53.948 --> 48:54.865
- You okay?

48:58.032 --> 48:59.217
- Not really.

48:59.217 --> 49:00.050
- What's, what's wrong.

49:00.050 --> 49:02.359
Ah, Anthony, don't tell me,
you got a girl pregnant.

49:02.359 --> 49:03.814
- No.
- Whew.

49:03.814 --> 49:05.564
- It's not like that.

49:10.401 --> 49:12.739
I owe a lot of money to
that guy, Playa Playa.

49:12.739 --> 49:13.739
- Damn, son.

49:14.905 --> 49:18.880
Shit, and I hear Playa Playa doesn't play.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.459
That sounded kinda weird.

49:20.459 --> 49:21.326
- Yeah, when you say it out loud.

49:21.326 --> 49:23.879
- I know I said it.
- Yeah.

49:23.879 --> 49:26.955
- Hey, you know when I look at you,

49:26.955 --> 49:31.112
you remind me a lot of
myself when I was your age.

49:31.112 --> 49:32.355
That's not what I meant.

49:32.355 --> 49:34.761
What I meant was when I
was your age I fell in love

49:34.761 --> 49:37.965
with your mother, God, rest her soul.

49:37.965 --> 49:40.442
She was the most beautiful
woman I'd ever seen.

49:40.442 --> 49:42.616
And then your grandpa, he
puts a shotgun in my face.

49:42.616 --> 49:44.144
I'm like, whoa, dude, hold on, man.

49:44.144 --> 49:45.343
I didn't screw you a goat,

49:45.343 --> 49:46.176
(imitates bleating)

49:46.176 --> 49:47.780
that doesn't spell (speaks
in foreign language).

49:47.780 --> 49:50.484
And if it does, prove it, better
yet, check the semen on it.

49:50.484 --> 49:51.578
It's not even mine.

49:51.578 --> 49:54.684
As a matter of fact, I remember
like it was just yesterday.

49:54.684 --> 49:57.428
I met your mom.
(voice distorts)

49:57.428 --> 49:59.957
But it was after mass of
course, it was after mass.

49:59.957 --> 50:01.164
(voice distorts)
I said, you know what,

50:01.164 --> 50:02.644
to hell with the devil,

50:02.644 --> 50:04.724
we're gonna get married now.

50:04.724 --> 50:06.622
(dad chuckles)

50:06.622 --> 50:11.006
Oh man, that's such a nice
story, don't you think?

50:11.006 --> 50:13.103
- I'm not gonna lie.

50:13.103 --> 50:14.983
I wasn't really listening.
(dad chuckles)

50:14.983 --> 50:17.236
- Look, son, the point is,

50:17.236 --> 50:20.457
sometimes it life, you just
gotta roll with the punches.

50:20.457 --> 50:23.228
I'm sure you'll figured something out.

50:23.228 --> 50:25.751
(hand slamming butt)

50:25.751 --> 50:27.924
- Okay, we gotta go.

50:27.924 --> 50:31.424
The rolling pit, ah, dad, you are a freak.

50:32.521 --> 50:34.111
(girl moaning)

50:34.111 --> 50:35.694
- Yeah, behind her.

50:36.753 --> 50:38.420
- You little fucker!

50:42.961 --> 50:46.461
- [Cujo] Knew you'd like Cujo style, baby.

50:47.723 --> 50:49.920
Cujo style! Yeah!

50:49.920 --> 50:50.753
Ah,

50:50.753 --> 50:51.596

50:51.596 --> 50:54.732
ah, I knew you'd like
Cujo style, baby, come on.

50:54.732 --> 50:56.982
You know you love it, yeah.

50:59.196 --> 51:00.029
- Get out!

51:00.029 --> 51:01.002
- What?
- What the fuck you doing,

51:01.002 --> 51:02.711
man?
- What?

51:02.711 --> 51:03.794
- Gross! Ugh!

51:05.913 --> 51:06.996
- Wait! Wait!

51:08.574 --> 51:09.927
Fucking foot.

51:09.927 --> 51:10.760
Hey, wait.

51:11.919 --> 51:13.154
Wait!

51:13.154 --> 51:15.521
I can't help it, it's a disease!

51:15.521 --> 51:19.195
- Ugh, wipe your, ugh, fuck, gross.

51:19.195 --> 51:20.755
- Sorry.

51:20.755 --> 51:22.564
- You don't have to do
that to yourself, man.

51:22.564 --> 51:25.064
Just abuse yourself like that.

51:26.069 --> 51:27.651
- I don't have the money to pay a hooker

51:27.651 --> 51:30.006
to do it for me, come on.

51:30.006 --> 51:33.225
(Jasmine scoffing)

51:33.225 --> 51:35.392
Wait, where are you going?

51:36.894 --> 51:37.811
- Fuck off!

51:39.184 --> 51:43.934
- What about old faithful?
(Cujo yelling)

51:45.700 --> 51:46.533
Fuck!

51:54.620 --> 51:56.946
- I hate working with stoners.

51:56.946 --> 52:00.719
- Dammit, the fucker, Cujo, the dammit!

52:00.719 --> 52:03.084
Cujo, what do I need to
do to make you understand

52:03.084 --> 52:04.089
that I like you?

52:04.089 --> 52:06.957
Seriously, dude, how can
I be more freaking clear?

52:06.957 --> 52:10.040
Ugh!
(Jasmine grunts)

52:12.124 --> 52:15.234
You're crazy! Crazy.
- Jasmine?

52:15.234 --> 52:16.067
- What?

52:17.444 --> 52:20.602
(lady laughs)
- No.

52:20.602 --> 52:24.352
That is mine.
(both laughing)

52:27.129 --> 52:29.528
What do you want?
- More pizza.

52:29.528 --> 52:32.445
How long have we been sitting here?

52:33.762 --> 52:34.893
- Whoa, excuse me?

52:34.893 --> 52:37.390
- Yes.
- Is it tomorrow yet?

52:37.390 --> 52:39.217
- No, but You two have been sitting here

52:39.217 --> 52:43.634
for almost two hours.
(both laughing)

52:52.567 --> 52:54.646
- Grandpa Harry?

52:54.646 --> 52:57.732
Grandpa, Harry, is that you?

52:57.732 --> 52:59.680
- Aunt Chelsea

52:59.680 --> 53:01.001
Is that really you?

53:01.001 --> 53:04.014
- How?
(both laughing)

53:04.014 --> 53:07.084
- Did you two order blast
from the past pizza?

53:07.084 --> 53:10.049
(both laughing)
- Really good,

53:10.049 --> 53:11.483
but I need a moment.

53:11.483 --> 53:14.462
I haven't seen my grandfather in 15 years.

53:14.462 --> 53:16.120
And I would like to speak with him.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.508
(both laughing)
- Yes!

53:18.508 --> 53:19.341
Hi.
- Yeah,

53:21.258 --> 53:22.465
sure, have fun.

53:22.465 --> 53:25.548
(laughing continues)

53:34.842 --> 53:35.779
- What's wrong?

53:35.779 --> 53:37.405
- What is wrong?

53:37.405 --> 53:38.956
You're asking me what's wrong.

53:38.956 --> 53:40.503
I'll tell you what's wrong.

53:40.503 --> 53:42.465
Cujo, that is what's wrong.

53:42.465 --> 53:43.512
- What did he do?

53:43.512 --> 53:44.436
- What he do?

53:44.436 --> 53:47.148
He call me hooker, a whore.

53:47.148 --> 53:48.991
Do I look like a whore to you?

53:48.991 --> 53:50.067
Look at me.

53:50.067 --> 53:51.354
- Not at all.

53:51.354 --> 53:54.391
Cujo needs a hooker, a
whore, a woman of the night.

53:54.391 --> 53:55.930
- I know.

53:55.930 --> 53:56.936
I'm ready.

53:56.936 --> 53:58.381
- Give the Jasmine.

53:58.381 --> 54:01.131
Love, love is like a pizza, okay?

54:02.359 --> 54:03.942
The crest is trust.

54:05.412 --> 54:07.662
The sauce is communication.

54:09.581 --> 54:12.588
Cheese, cheese is laughter.

54:12.588 --> 54:15.657
The pepperoni, that's that good stuff.

54:15.657 --> 54:16.592
That good lovin'.

54:16.592 --> 54:17.806
What you wanna do is you wanna get

54:17.806 --> 54:20.006
all of those together, okay?

54:20.006 --> 54:22.920
You wanna put 'em in the
oven, you wanna bake 'em

54:22.920 --> 54:26.755
'til the cheese melts and that
pepperoni soaks into that,

54:26.755 --> 54:29.070
soaks into that crust.

54:29.070 --> 54:30.891
- You wanna pin the box,

54:30.891 --> 54:33.695
and take it out for delivery.

54:33.695 --> 54:35.440
No, right now, you got a delivery.

54:35.440 --> 54:36.273
- Oh.

54:36.273 --> 54:38.394
- Awesome, thanks, Jasmine, high five.

54:38.394 --> 54:39.798
Go get it.

54:39.798 --> 54:40.821
- [Anthony] So dude.

54:40.821 --> 54:42.383
- Oh, what's up doc.

54:42.383 --> 54:44.458
Just chillin' man, trying to ease my mind,

54:44.458 --> 54:45.751
get a tan, you know?

54:45.751 --> 54:47.401
- So, what's up?

54:47.401 --> 54:50.121
- Hey, what's up with
you and the new girl?

54:50.121 --> 54:51.737
- I really don't know yet.

54:51.737 --> 54:53.091
What do you think of her?

54:53.091 --> 54:54.393
- She seems cool, man.

54:54.393 --> 54:57.568
Sexy, yeah.
- She seems really sweet.

54:57.568 --> 55:00.207
- Yeah. You gonna smash her or what?

55:00.207 --> 55:02.737
- Ha! It's not like that, man.

55:02.737 --> 55:04.917
- What you mean is not like that?

55:04.917 --> 55:07.101
- It's different, you know?

55:07.101 --> 55:08.059
- All right, man, well look,

55:08.059 --> 55:11.408
whatever you do, just make
sure you keep Isabella

55:11.408 --> 55:13.643
as far away from her as you can.

55:13.643 --> 55:17.060
That girl is a crazy psycho killer bitch.

55:28.731 --> 55:30.181
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

55:30.181 --> 55:31.475
- Excuse me?

55:31.475 --> 55:32.997
- Who are you?

55:32.997 --> 55:34.230
- Excuse me.

55:34.230 --> 55:35.063
- Ugh!

55:37.954 --> 55:39.272
- Ariel.

55:39.272 --> 55:40.105
- Ariel?

55:41.762 --> 55:44.841
- Anthony, come quick, Isabella out front

55:44.841 --> 55:46.725
and she 'cause big problems.

55:46.725 --> 55:49.054
- Oh, Ariel like the bitch fish

55:49.054 --> 55:50.949
from like the "Under The Sea" movie?

55:50.949 --> 55:53.577
Oh my gosh, I thought that it, hey.

55:53.577 --> 55:54.441
- What the hell are you doing?

55:54.441 --> 55:56.121
Remember, you can't be coming up here.

55:56.121 --> 55:57.806
- Why can't I be coming up here?

55:57.806 --> 56:00.926
- Because you make Gus
nervous with your crazy ass.

56:00.926 --> 56:02.826
- I have 911 on speed dial.

56:02.826 --> 56:04.586
- God you're a pussy.

56:04.586 --> 56:05.549
So what up?

56:05.549 --> 56:07.407
Are we getting back together or what?

56:07.407 --> 56:08.569
- Or what.

56:08.569 --> 56:09.658
- Shut your vagina, Thomas!

56:09.658 --> 56:10.891
No, one's talking to you!

56:10.891 --> 56:12.726
- We're not getting back
together, all right?

56:12.726 --> 56:13.559
- What?

56:14.637 --> 56:16.788
Is it because of that bitch?

56:16.788 --> 56:18.352
- The fuck you just call me?

56:18.352 --> 56:19.491
- Hey, don't call her that.

56:19.491 --> 56:20.562
- Did you get in her panties yet?

56:20.562 --> 56:22.446
- It's her first day.

56:22.446 --> 56:25.504
- Yeah, like I said, did
you get in her panties yet?

56:25.504 --> 56:27.182
She looks like the type
that gives it away.

56:27.182 --> 56:28.622
This girl had dick for breakfast.

56:28.622 --> 56:31.444
(Thomas laughs)

56:31.444 --> 56:35.965
Come on, baby, you know
I can't get over you.

56:35.965 --> 56:40.300
(explosion rumbling)
- What have you done?

56:40.300 --> 56:41.717
What've you done?

56:46.074 --> 56:48.907
- Was it worth liking her picture?

56:50.205 --> 56:51.302
(Isabella giggles)

56:51.302 --> 56:53.497
- You know, the best way to
get over somebody is to get

56:53.497 --> 56:54.699
under somebody, bruh,

56:54.699 --> 56:57.129
and she smashed everybody on the block.

56:57.129 --> 56:57.962
- Can it, Thomas!

56:57.962 --> 57:02.562
Oh, I'll take my heel off
and I'll shove it so far!

57:02.562 --> 57:04.405
Why don't you wanna be with me?

57:04.405 --> 57:06.668
- Seriously? You cheated
on me like 14 times.

57:06.668 --> 57:07.501
- 17.

57:09.039 --> 57:10.586
- Seriously, dude?
- Yeah bro.

57:10.586 --> 57:13.207
I have it marked every day in my calendar

57:13.207 --> 57:16.220
for every time that you called
me up crying like a bitch

57:16.220 --> 57:17.795
because she cheated on you.

57:17.795 --> 57:22.545
Trust me, Isabella is a lying,
dirty, funky, diseased ho.

57:24.304 --> 57:25.466
- Shut the hell up.

57:25.466 --> 57:26.423
Go smoke a Dick.

57:26.423 --> 57:29.198
- I learned how to do
it from watching you.

57:29.198 --> 57:30.104
- What?

57:30.104 --> 57:32.527
- That didn't sound right.

57:32.527 --> 57:34.204
- Look, you need to go, all right?

57:34.204 --> 57:35.704
Gus, call 'em now.

57:37.577 --> 57:41.899
- You need to stop staring
'cause I will kick your ass.

57:41.899 --> 57:44.401
- Try it.
- Ladies, come on.

57:44.401 --> 57:45.833
- Man, let 'em go.
- Thomas.

57:45.833 --> 57:48.952
- Listen, slut, I can call you that right?

57:48.952 --> 57:51.166
Your fucking face is like a car accident.

57:51.166 --> 57:53.453
It's just so grotesque and tragic

57:53.453 --> 57:56.658
but I cannot fucking stop looking away.

57:56.658 --> 57:58.517
- Fuck you, bitch.

57:58.517 --> 58:00.313
- Oh!
- Oh, hell no!

58:00.313 --> 58:01.417
- Let her come at me!

58:01.417 --> 58:03.340
(chaotic yelling)

58:03.340 --> 58:05.008
- Get out of here, now!

58:05.008 --> 58:06.475
- You're on a death watch!

58:06.475 --> 58:09.586
- You're not gonna do shit, bitch!

58:09.586 --> 58:11.253
- Fuck you, asshole!

58:12.502 --> 58:14.835
Best Phu King pizza, my ass.

58:17.878 --> 58:20.223
- Cops are on their way!

58:20.223 --> 58:21.601
- Yeah.

58:21.601 --> 58:24.491
- She is like sexy in a crazy way.

58:24.491 --> 58:27.658
(everyone applauding)

58:30.568 --> 58:33.212
- Hey, Gus, call the cops back
man, tell 'em not to come.

58:33.212 --> 58:35.586
- I never called 'em, I was bluffing.

58:35.586 --> 58:38.336
(door squeaking)

58:39.914 --> 58:41.872
- Hey guys, hey, hey, hey!

58:41.872 --> 58:43.615
Listen, we need y'all in the office

58:43.615 --> 58:44.573
for a quick safety meeting, all right?

58:44.573 --> 58:45.740
You too, Seth.

58:56.023 --> 58:59.161
Guys, y'all remember
how we almost got shut

58:59.161 --> 59:00.272
down a while back, right?

59:00.272 --> 59:01.683
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:01.683 --> 59:03.800
- But no matter how bad
things got Thomas made sure

59:03.800 --> 59:06.839
all of us got paid on time without fail.

59:06.839 --> 59:07.848
Part of our deal with Playa Playa is

59:07.848 --> 59:09.215
that we pay him 20 grand every month

59:09.215 --> 59:12.447
for using his Jamaican goddess.

59:12.447 --> 59:16.367
But last night someone
stole our payment money.

59:16.367 --> 59:17.669
- Don't look at me.

59:17.669 --> 59:18.885
I didn't do it.

59:18.885 --> 59:22.347
- I didn't do it either.
- It wasn't me, man.

59:22.347 --> 59:24.078
- Hey, what about Gus?

59:24.078 --> 59:25.941
- Man, we all know Gus is too stupid

59:25.941 --> 59:28.077
to try something like that.

59:28.077 --> 59:30.037
Bottom line is me and Anthony gotta pay

59:30.037 --> 59:32.642
up by midnight tonight
or we get dealt with.

59:32.642 --> 59:35.290
(Cujo laughs)
- Holy shit.

59:35.290 --> 59:36.409
I'm working with two dead guys.

59:36.409 --> 59:37.856
- Shut the fuck up.
- Ow!

59:37.856 --> 59:39.965
- Boom.
- Okay. Okay.

59:39.965 --> 59:42.978
I thought Playa Playa was all legit now.

59:42.978 --> 59:44.183
- So did we.

59:44.183 --> 59:46.426
Look Thomas and I put our money together

59:46.426 --> 59:48.348
and if I take the roughly four
grand that we've made today

59:48.348 --> 59:50.636
in sales, that puts us at about 16

59:50.636 --> 59:52.721
but we're still four short.

59:52.721 --> 59:53.888
- We are dead.

59:55.666 --> 59:59.221
- Look, this is our fault, all right?

59:59.221 --> 1:00:00.634
If things go bad, it's on us.

1:00:00.634 --> 1:00:05.051
And if you guys wanna bail,
we completely understand.

1:00:06.714 --> 1:00:09.797
- I have about $200 saved up at home.

1:00:12.131 --> 1:00:14.725
It's yours if you want it, man.

1:00:14.725 --> 1:00:16.507
- Thank you, man, thank you.
- Thank you.

1:00:16.507 --> 1:00:18.090
- I have about 400.

1:00:21.248 --> 1:00:22.239
- That's awesome, thank you.
- Thank you.

1:00:22.239 --> 1:00:23.239
- Thank you.

1:00:25.433 --> 1:00:28.576
- What? I got nothing, zilch.

1:00:28.576 --> 1:00:31.466
All my porn subscription
sites are expensive.

1:00:31.466 --> 1:00:35.316
- You have a fucking
problem, dude, you know that?

1:00:35.316 --> 1:00:37.076
- That's okay, all right?

1:00:37.076 --> 1:00:39.332
That gives us 600 more, right?

1:00:39.332 --> 1:00:43.050
That means we're only $3,400 short.

1:00:43.050 --> 1:00:44.251
Load up all your deliveries.

1:00:44.251 --> 1:00:47.025
Remember to bring money
in on the way back.

1:00:47.025 --> 1:00:48.506
Thomas, you and me.
- All right.

1:00:48.506 --> 1:00:51.339
(edgy rock music)

1:00:53.189 --> 1:00:58.189
(cat screeching)
(edgy rock music continues)

1:01:03.914 --> 1:01:05.302
- Phu King Pizza!

1:01:05.302 --> 1:01:06.719
- Phu King Pizza.

1:01:08.599 --> 1:01:13.599
- Good night, papa.
(edgy rock music continues)

1:01:32.670 --> 1:01:37.670
(boxes rumbling)
(edgy rock music continues)

1:01:49.260 --> 1:01:54.260
(cash register dinging)
(edgy rock music continues)

1:02:13.941 --> 1:02:18.941
(Cujo yelling)
(edgy rock music continues)

1:02:19.518 --> 1:02:23.685
- Woo!
(edgy rock music continues)

1:02:28.510 --> 1:02:29.343
- What's up?

1:02:29.343 --> 1:02:33.260
Ah!
(edgy rock music continues)

1:02:34.947 --> 1:02:39.947
- I can bite you, come on now.
(edgy rock music continues)

1:02:50.094 --> 1:02:52.890
- A blowjob from a babe
with three nipples.

1:02:52.890 --> 1:02:55.164
My papa's gonna be so proud.

1:02:55.164 --> 1:02:55.997
Yeah!

1:02:59.069 --> 1:03:02.217
- Okay, send Thomas, put
in a lights out, nice.

1:03:02.217 --> 1:03:05.884
(edgy rock music continues)

1:03:18.381 --> 1:03:21.640
(both yelling)
- Oh, oh my God.

1:03:21.640 --> 1:03:23.136
We have 10 more pizzas to make.

1:03:23.136 --> 1:03:25.553
- No, no, don't, no, no more.

1:03:27.973 --> 1:03:29.306
No more!

1:03:29.306 --> 1:03:30.358
(Chad laughing)
- Yeah,

1:03:30.358 --> 1:03:31.235
I've got this sign all day.

1:03:31.235 --> 1:03:32.373
- I can't even see it.

1:03:32.373 --> 1:03:34.997
- Okay guys, listen up.

1:03:34.997 --> 1:03:36.705
Chad.
- I'm Will, he's Chad.

1:03:36.705 --> 1:03:38.457
- Yeah, I'm Chad and that's Will.

1:03:38.457 --> 1:03:39.730
- Whatever.

1:03:39.730 --> 1:03:43.775
Look, today was really, really bad, guys.

1:03:43.775 --> 1:03:44.748
- What?
- What?

1:03:44.748 --> 1:03:46.238
Hey.

1:03:46.238 --> 1:03:47.803
What, our shit was solid.

1:03:47.803 --> 1:03:48.636
- Yeah.

1:03:50.232 --> 1:03:51.530
- You're kidding me, right?

1:03:51.530 --> 1:03:55.037
- No, man, sign spin is a
lot harder than you think.

1:03:55.037 --> 1:03:57.484
- All right, you're joking,
it's not hard at all.

1:03:57.484 --> 1:03:58.933
- Have you ever tried it?

1:03:58.933 --> 1:03:59.766
- No.

1:04:02.709 --> 1:04:04.209
- Well, you should try it
'cause it's pretty hard.

1:04:04.209 --> 1:04:05.700
- I don't have to,

1:04:05.700 --> 1:04:08.593
I don't want, I don't have to
try it, okay? I'm a manager.

1:04:08.593 --> 1:04:11.040
See that? It says Gus, manager.

1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:12.980
I'm the boss here, okay?
- Okay.

1:04:12.980 --> 1:04:14.067
- And you guys suck.

1:04:14.067 --> 1:04:15.652
- You suck.

1:04:15.652 --> 1:04:17.134
- [Chad] You must be blind.

1:04:17.134 --> 1:04:20.334
- Look, you guys did
horrible today, shitty.

1:04:20.334 --> 1:04:22.821
- So, which one of us got the job?

1:04:22.821 --> 1:04:24.961
- Neither one of you got the job.

1:04:24.961 --> 1:04:26.215
I'm not hiring you, either one

1:04:26.215 --> 1:04:28.100
of your sorry asses.
- Man, that is fucked up, man.

1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:30.678
- I had to wear this stupid
shit all day for nothing?

1:04:30.678 --> 1:04:33.116
- Hey, hey.
- You said you was gonna hire

1:04:33.116 --> 1:04:33.949
one of us.

1:04:33.949 --> 1:04:35.321
- Well, you said one
of you guys were gonna

1:04:35.321 --> 1:04:38.187
actually work, okay?
- Old naked mole rat.

1:04:38.187 --> 1:04:40.663
- Turn your uniforms in, gimme your sign.

1:04:40.663 --> 1:04:41.811
I'll be inside.

1:04:41.811 --> 1:04:44.294
Thank you and goodbye.

1:04:44.294 --> 1:04:48.019
(upbeat salsa music)

1:04:48.019 --> 1:04:51.269
- Cujo, why is everyone in such a rush?

1:04:52.414 --> 1:04:55.122
- I don't know nothing from nothing,

1:04:55.122 --> 1:04:58.029
but we gotta come up with $3,400

1:04:58.029 --> 1:05:02.682
or else Playa Playa's gonna
kill Anthony and Thomas.

1:05:02.682 --> 1:05:04.891
- Okay, Who's Playa Playa

1:05:04.891 --> 1:05:08.187
and why is he gonna
kill Anthony and Thomas?

1:05:08.187 --> 1:05:09.515
- See, this is what happens

1:05:09.515 --> 1:05:13.035
when Cujo doesn't release
his cracking, you know,

1:05:13.035 --> 1:05:15.479
they got me all running around,

1:05:15.479 --> 1:05:17.891
a dog cannot release his nut,

1:05:17.891 --> 1:05:20.507
Jasmine's all pissed off at me.

1:05:20.507 --> 1:05:23.840
She wants me to go to sex therapy, fuck.

1:05:26.258 --> 1:05:27.371
- Answer my question

1:05:27.371 --> 1:05:29.750
or I swear to God I
will kick the testicles

1:05:29.750 --> 1:05:34.083
clean off your body.
(Cujo whimpers)

1:05:36.151 --> 1:05:39.318
(upbeat salsa music)

1:05:43.252 --> 1:05:45.835
- You know, two dead guys, man,

1:05:46.849 --> 1:05:49.914
that's like more money for us.

1:05:49.914 --> 1:05:51.896
- Fucking kidding, man?
- It's our space.

1:05:51.896 --> 1:05:54.480
- Yeah, they're our friends,
dude, what the fuck?

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.032
- Not my problem.
- Fuck are we gonna do?

1:05:57.032 --> 1:05:58.346
- I don't know.

1:05:58.346 --> 1:06:00.379
- You know what? We should
all throw our tip money.

1:06:00.379 --> 1:06:02.376
Just for today, you know, just in case.

1:06:02.376 --> 1:06:05.809
- No, I can't give my tip money.

1:06:05.809 --> 1:06:08.301
I got monthly porn sites to pay, come on.

1:06:08.301 --> 1:06:10.741
- For fuck's sake, Cujo, you know what?

1:06:10.741 --> 1:06:13.492
If you give your tip money,
I'll have sex with you.

1:06:13.492 --> 1:06:14.325
All right?

1:06:16.381 --> 1:06:17.943
- What is there to think about dude?

1:06:17.943 --> 1:06:19.943
Get that boom, boom pow.

1:06:21.570 --> 1:06:26.487
- But like paying Jasmine is
like calling Jasmine my whore,

1:06:28.759 --> 1:06:30.766
which is sexy and all, but.

1:06:30.766 --> 1:06:32.747
- You motherfucker!
- What?

1:06:32.747 --> 1:06:35.217
- If you had half of a brain
in that thick skull of you,

1:06:35.217 --> 1:06:37.972
you will realize that I fucking like you,

1:06:37.972 --> 1:06:42.722
you stupid (speaks in foreign language).

1:06:46.991 --> 1:06:48.741
- Not okay, see, man.

1:06:54.769 --> 1:06:57.019
- Hey, what's up? I'm back.

1:06:59.663 --> 1:07:01.659
Need some help?

1:07:01.659 --> 1:07:04.825
- I need to talk to you, but not out here.

1:07:04.825 --> 1:07:05.658
- Okay.

1:07:11.069 --> 1:07:13.538
What's up, what's wrong?

1:07:13.538 --> 1:07:15.131
- Cujo told me that you
were gonna be killed

1:07:15.131 --> 1:07:17.653
because some drug dealer
guy with a stupid name.

1:07:17.653 --> 1:07:19.927
- Playa Playa isn't even
a drug dealer anymore.

1:07:19.927 --> 1:07:22.208
Wait, Cujo told you about that?

1:07:22.208 --> 1:07:26.269
- That foamy mouthed, disg,
ooh man, I should stick my foot

1:07:26.269 --> 1:07:28.342
up his ass, but he'd probably like it.

1:07:28.342 --> 1:07:30.032
- Why aren't you just asking me?

1:07:30.032 --> 1:07:32.108
- Why should I have to
tell you anything, huh?

1:07:32.108 --> 1:07:34.753
This is your first day.

1:07:34.753 --> 1:07:35.586
You know what, I don't even have time

1:07:35.586 --> 1:07:36.758
for this right now, okay?

1:07:36.758 --> 1:07:40.341
As you know I have a
lot of pizzas to sell.

1:07:41.724 --> 1:07:43.813
- Is he always like this?

1:07:43.813 --> 1:07:45.778
- Don't be mad at him.

1:07:45.778 --> 1:07:47.528
This is all my fault.

1:07:51.583 --> 1:07:54.852
- You know, this reminds me of "Hamlet."

1:07:54.852 --> 1:07:58.685
When sorrows come, they
come not single spies,

1:08:00.608 --> 1:08:04.608
but in battalions.
(thug crying)

1:08:09.777 --> 1:08:11.610
What's wrong with you?

1:08:13.113 --> 1:08:16.678
- He read the end of "Romeo And Juliet."

1:08:16.678 --> 1:08:18.572
- Everyone dies, Shorty.

1:08:18.572 --> 1:08:19.991
And they were just kids, man.

1:08:19.991 --> 1:08:22.292
- Man, see, I told him
not to ruin it for me.

1:08:22.292 --> 1:08:24.162
- I ruined it? I ruined shit, man.

1:08:24.162 --> 1:08:26.131
- Yeah, you just told me how-
- Yeah, but don't listen.

1:08:26.131 --> 1:08:28.231
- Like, how am I gonna
end that tootie, tootie

1:08:28.231 --> 1:08:29.564
in my fucking ears?
- Oh man, you'd say

1:08:29.564 --> 1:08:31.284
you ain't gotta hear it.
- You, shut up!

1:08:31.284 --> 1:08:34.534
You should shut up and just drink this.

1:08:37.822 --> 1:08:40.905
(mellow salsa music)

1:08:42.112 --> 1:08:45.043
(phone ringing)

1:08:45.043 --> 1:08:45.876
- What's up bro?

1:08:45.876 --> 1:08:47.158
- Yeah. Can you do me a favor?

1:08:47.158 --> 1:08:48.426
Can you meet me at the docks?

1:08:48.426 --> 1:08:50.493
We're going down and I
don't wanna get blazed

1:08:50.493 --> 1:08:52.410
with you one last time.

1:08:56.294 --> 1:08:58.820
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm here bro.

1:08:58.820 --> 1:09:00.535
Yeah. I'll see you in 10 minutes.

1:09:00.535 --> 1:09:01.368
Okay.

1:09:08.599 --> 1:09:11.599
- You look beat, are you okay, Seth?

1:09:12.690 --> 1:09:13.523
Hey, at least you don't have to deal

1:09:13.523 --> 1:09:15.850
with these crazy ass customers out there.

1:09:15.850 --> 1:09:18.847
Can't be that bad back
here in the kitchen.

1:09:18.847 --> 1:09:21.097
- I make all pizza all day.

1:09:22.489 --> 1:09:25.530
I pee myself 'cause I
don't even go to bathroom.

1:09:25.530 --> 1:09:28.738
- Well go to the bathroom
now, I could, go.

1:09:28.738 --> 1:09:33.106
- In my country we don't
leave job unfinished.

1:09:33.106 --> 1:09:35.463
- I can finish this for you, just go.

1:09:35.463 --> 1:09:37.880
- No! You no touch my pizzas.

1:09:38.811 --> 1:09:41.413
I break your fucking arm up to elbow.

1:09:41.413 --> 1:09:44.157
Go, comb that fucked up
hair or something like that.

1:09:44.157 --> 1:09:46.720
- Fine, you do it, asshole.

1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:48.930
Don't piss yourself anymore,
that calls for violation.

1:09:48.930 --> 1:09:52.097
(gentle guitar music)

1:10:05.279 --> 1:10:06.739
- [Thomas] 'Sup, man?

1:10:06.739 --> 1:10:07.572
- 'Sup?

1:10:12.346 --> 1:10:13.179
(Thomas sighs)

1:10:13.179 --> 1:10:16.523
- It's one hell of a mess, huh?

1:10:16.523 --> 1:10:17.356
- Yeah.

1:10:17.356 --> 1:10:21.023
- Look, man, this, this
is on me, all right?

1:10:22.621 --> 1:10:25.544
If I hadn't messed everything
up at the pizza joint already,

1:10:25.544 --> 1:10:27.710
we wouldn't even be in any
of this mess if I hadn't-

1:10:27.710 --> 1:10:31.043
- Bro, hey, this isn't all on you, okay?

1:10:32.675 --> 1:10:35.134
I mean there's no way you coulda
expected someone to rob us.

1:10:35.134 --> 1:10:36.884
That's some bullshit.

1:10:42.713 --> 1:10:46.657
- Still man, my parents put me in charge.

1:10:46.657 --> 1:10:48.174
And look what happened.

1:10:48.174 --> 1:10:51.232
We're gonna be dead in a couple hours.

1:10:51.232 --> 1:10:55.062
I'm just, I'm sorry I got
you mixed up in all this.

1:10:55.062 --> 1:10:58.562
I just, you know, I should've listen, man.

1:11:00.252 --> 1:11:05.169
- Bro, I've known you pretty
much my entire life, you know?

1:11:07.478 --> 1:11:08.985
I mean, you're the one who
convinced me to try weed

1:11:08.985 --> 1:11:11.486
for the first time, you
remember that, you know?

1:11:11.486 --> 1:11:13.471
I mean, if we die tonight,
we're going down together, man.

1:11:13.471 --> 1:11:15.343
Fuck that shit.

1:11:15.343 --> 1:11:16.681
Gotcha.
- Love you, bro.

1:11:16.681 --> 1:11:17.827
- Love you, bro.

1:11:17.827 --> 1:11:19.493
- Here you go.
- Last one of the night.

1:11:19.493 --> 1:11:21.524
- Thank you, have a good night.

1:11:21.524 --> 1:11:23.116
- Sir?
- Oh, hey, what's up?

1:11:23.116 --> 1:11:23.949
How's it going?

1:11:23.949 --> 1:11:28.199
- Hey, I'm sorry, we're
actually closing right now.

1:11:29.417 --> 1:11:30.917
- Are you serious?

1:11:32.414 --> 1:11:35.224
Houston, we have a problem.

1:11:35.224 --> 1:11:38.414
I really need one of those
space pizzas from earlier.

1:11:38.414 --> 1:11:42.649
That thing is like
intergalactic, mind blowing.

1:11:42.649 --> 1:11:44.816
Isn't it you from earlier?

1:11:47.261 --> 1:11:49.622
- I don't know, but I know
another guy named Bill,

1:11:49.622 --> 1:11:51.115
I can go get him if you want.

1:11:51.115 --> 1:11:53.114
- No, don't do that, don't do that.

1:11:53.114 --> 1:11:54.433
- No?
- No.

1:11:54.433 --> 1:11:55.788
So it's Bill?

1:11:55.788 --> 1:11:59.130
- Oh wait, it is Bill.
(Bill laughs)

1:11:59.130 --> 1:12:00.092
What's your name?

1:12:00.092 --> 1:12:00.925
- I'm Ariel.

1:12:00.925 --> 1:12:02.340
- Ariel, wow.

1:12:02.340 --> 1:12:04.257
You're like that princess from the movies.

1:12:04.257 --> 1:12:07.389
You even look like her a little.

1:12:07.389 --> 1:12:12.222
- You know, Bill, you look so
different from this morning.

1:12:13.165 --> 1:12:15.511
You know these pieces have like
really strong weed in them.

1:12:15.511 --> 1:12:18.619
Like really, really strong.
- What?

1:12:18.619 --> 1:12:20.549
That's fucking awesome.

1:12:20.549 --> 1:12:21.985
I'll take 10.

1:12:21.985 --> 1:12:25.291
- No, see, Bill, we're closing.

1:12:25.291 --> 1:12:27.477
- Huge bummer, dude.
- I know.

1:12:27.477 --> 1:12:28.416
- What?

1:12:28.416 --> 1:12:32.432
I will make you my weed
princess Ariel from the movies.

1:12:32.432 --> 1:12:35.437
- That's actually not a thing.

1:12:35.437 --> 1:12:37.615
- Oh, have a good one kid.

1:12:37.615 --> 1:12:38.448
- Okay.

1:12:41.524 --> 1:12:43.068
- Yo, Shorty,

1:12:43.068 --> 1:12:44.811
now why are we always
watching this place, Shorty?

1:12:44.811 --> 1:12:49.240
because I said so and who the
hell are you to question me?

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.766
- Why you always got to
be upsetting the man, bro?

1:12:51.766 --> 1:12:53.937
- Man, I just asked him
a question, all right?

1:12:53.937 --> 1:12:56.784
- Yeah, but don't ask stupid questions.

1:12:56.784 --> 1:12:58.393
- How the fuck am I supposed
to know what's stupid

1:12:58.393 --> 1:12:59.873
and not stupid?
- It's common sense, bro.

1:12:59.873 --> 1:13:01.215
- So now I'm the stupid motherfucker

1:13:01.215 --> 1:13:02.213
for not knowing the difference.

1:13:02.213 --> 1:13:03.304
- I ain't calling you stupid.

1:13:03.304 --> 1:13:04.137
I said your questions-
- well it sounds

1:13:04.137 --> 1:13:05.372
like you're fucking calling me stupid.

1:13:05.372 --> 1:13:07.639
- No, I said your question was stupid.

1:13:07.639 --> 1:13:08.472
- Not knowing the difference, right?

1:13:08.472 --> 1:13:10.318
I didn't say that shit.
- Well, you, it sounds like-

1:13:10.318 --> 1:13:11.151
- Yo, both of you shut up,

1:13:11.151 --> 1:13:14.901
before I bounce both
your heads off the wall.

1:13:22.839 --> 1:13:24.045
(knocking on door)

1:13:24.045 --> 1:13:26.044
- Anthony!
- Damn, bro.

1:13:26.044 --> 1:13:27.514
That's crazy Isabella, dude.

1:13:27.514 --> 1:13:28.347
- Yo.

1:13:28.347 --> 1:13:29.730
- Yo, I ditched her
crazy ass one time, bro,

1:13:29.730 --> 1:13:30.989
I thought she was gonna cut my dick off

1:13:30.989 --> 1:13:32.276
after some other chick texted me.

1:13:32.276 --> 1:13:34.080
- Yo, you hit that too, bro?

1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:36.330
- Bro, come on, who hasn't?

1:13:38.327 --> 1:13:41.068
- Crazy bitch killed my fish, man.

1:13:41.068 --> 1:13:43.188
Yo, I loved that fish, man.

1:13:43.188 --> 1:13:44.041
- Man, who the fuck does that, bro?

1:13:44.041 --> 1:13:45.958
- I don't fucking know.

1:13:47.138 --> 1:13:48.488
- Shorty, is that you?

1:13:48.488 --> 1:13:50.588
You son of a bitch!

1:13:50.588 --> 1:13:51.982
- Shorty-
- That's enough, let's go!

1:13:51.982 --> 1:13:55.815
Let's go.
(suspenseful music)

1:14:09.511 --> 1:14:12.943
- Never leave a dog behind
with his fucking full load,

1:14:12.943 --> 1:14:15.707
'cause his balls will explode.

1:14:15.707 --> 1:14:17.941
Shit, you two looked blazed.

1:14:17.941 --> 1:14:19.276
Got any left for me?

1:14:19.276 --> 1:14:20.210
- Man, shut up.

1:14:20.210 --> 1:14:22.413
All right? You're in no
position to be asking for shit.

1:14:22.413 --> 1:14:23.632
- What did I do?

1:14:23.632 --> 1:14:24.914
- He knows you told me.

1:14:24.914 --> 1:14:26.068
- But it wasn't my fault.

1:14:26.068 --> 1:14:29.294
- Man, shut up Cujo or
I'll mess you up SA.

1:14:29.294 --> 1:14:30.732
- Bitch, I'll bite your dick off.

1:14:30.732 --> 1:14:32.940
- Bitch, you know you want
this dick in your mouth?

1:14:32.940 --> 1:14:35.219
- Man, both of you shut up, all right?

1:14:35.219 --> 1:14:39.001
Let's just go see how much money we have.

1:14:39.001 --> 1:14:42.001
(melancholic music)

1:14:50.364 --> 1:14:55.031
- Come on.
(speaks in foreign language)

1:14:57.036 --> 1:15:00.202
- Yeah, there it is.
- Take it in deeper.

1:15:00.202 --> 1:15:02.307
- I can't go any further.

1:15:02.307 --> 1:15:04.065
- [Woman] Feels good?

1:15:04.065 --> 1:15:06.873
- I don't know if I like it.

1:15:06.873 --> 1:15:10.177
I like it.
- I knew you'd like it.

1:15:10.177 --> 1:15:13.418
- It's starting to hurt.
- Pull your tongue for two.

1:15:13.418 --> 1:15:15.557
- Yeah, yeah, it's in, oh yeah.

1:15:15.557 --> 1:15:17.387
Oh.
- Oh yeah.

1:15:17.387 --> 1:15:18.829
- Gus, what the fuck?

1:15:18.829 --> 1:15:20.249
- What're you guys doing here so late?

1:15:20.249 --> 1:15:21.082
- You know what those things are?

1:15:21.082 --> 1:15:22.209
They're meant to head up your ass!

1:15:22.209 --> 1:15:23.042
- Nothing!

1:15:24.113 --> 1:15:25.402
- Daddy's here, baby, show me that sweet.

1:15:25.402 --> 1:15:27.981
- Hey, who are you and what
did you do with Charlie?

1:15:27.981 --> 1:15:29.473
(woman moaning)

1:15:29.473 --> 1:15:31.167
- Hey, man, my eyes have been opened

1:15:31.167 --> 1:15:33.716
to a whole new world.
- Yeah, whatever.

1:15:33.716 --> 1:15:34.847
Let's just do this.

1:15:34.847 --> 1:15:36.962
- Well, what about-
- Who cares, man?

1:15:36.962 --> 1:15:37.851
All right, just do it.

1:15:37.851 --> 1:15:40.601
(dramatic music)

1:15:45.190 --> 1:15:47.385
- Christ on a bike,
what's all that money for?

1:15:47.385 --> 1:15:49.302
- It's long story, Gus.

1:15:54.010 --> 1:15:55.177
Seriously man.

1:15:57.653 --> 1:15:58.986
Okay, that's 10.

1:16:03.381 --> 1:16:04.858
- No way.

1:16:04.858 --> 1:16:06.441
- How short are we?

1:16:08.023 --> 1:16:12.025
- We have $20,175, oh
shit, man, we did it.

1:16:12.025 --> 1:16:13.139
- What?
- We did it!

1:16:13.139 --> 1:16:14.271
- Oh, you did good!
(upbeat music)

1:16:14.271 --> 1:16:16.427
(knocking at the door)
- Oh, we're closed!

1:16:16.427 --> 1:16:19.227
(knocking continues)

1:16:19.227 --> 1:16:20.394
We are closed!

1:16:21.346 --> 1:16:23.157
(knocking continues)

1:16:23.157 --> 1:16:24.500
I said we're fucking closed!

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:27.152
(knocking continues)
- Dammit, I'll handle it.

1:16:27.152 --> 1:16:28.569
- Handle it, dog.

1:16:29.716 --> 1:16:30.979
- Dou feel better?

1:16:30.979 --> 1:16:32.246
- Yeah.

1:16:32.246 --> 1:16:35.552
- I threw in $800 from my savings account.

1:16:35.552 --> 1:16:37.411
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1:16:37.411 --> 1:16:38.864
- You didn't have to do that.

1:16:38.864 --> 1:16:40.376
- No, I wanted to.

1:16:40.376 --> 1:16:43.326
Besides you owe me a date.

1:16:43.326 --> 1:16:44.659
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1:16:47.096 --> 1:16:51.225
(door opening)
- Some of the last.

1:16:51.225 --> 1:16:53.892
- Guys.
- Ooh, shit fucking jazz.

1:16:54.726 --> 1:16:56.372
Yes, I told you this
place was vacant, baby.

1:16:56.372 --> 1:16:57.981
- Yeah, you did say that shit,

1:16:57.981 --> 1:16:59.474
your eyes are so big.
- Put your cargo wearing ass

1:16:59.474 --> 1:17:02.161
over there, put the damn money in the bag!

1:17:02.161 --> 1:17:03.680
- Man, I ain't giving you shit.

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:06.350
- Oh. He say he ain't giving me no shit?

1:17:06.350 --> 1:17:07.936
- I think he said-
- Man it's so unfair.

1:17:07.936 --> 1:17:08.907
- Look, you got two choices,

1:17:08.907 --> 1:17:11.022
you can either put the cash in the bag

1:17:11.022 --> 1:17:14.268
or you can give me that ass, sweetie.

1:17:14.268 --> 1:17:16.340
- Man, what's going on with you?

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:17.260
- Pop off, man.

1:17:17.260 --> 1:17:18.372
- Pop one?
- Pop off.

1:17:18.372 --> 1:17:19.205
- Two or one?

1:17:19.205 --> 1:17:21.256
- Pop the fuck up.
(gun firing)

1:17:21.256 --> 1:17:23.610
- Shit, all you had to
do is ask nicely, God.

1:17:23.610 --> 1:17:24.778
And say please.

1:17:24.778 --> 1:17:29.519
- And don't nobody fucking
call the fucking police either.

1:17:29.519 --> 1:17:32.668
- You took your mask off.
- What the fuck?

1:17:32.668 --> 1:17:33.801
- Yeah.
- Get the fuck outta here.

1:17:33.801 --> 1:17:35.522
- Okay, yeah, yeah, fuck the police!

1:17:35.522 --> 1:17:37.580
Get the fuck out of here.
- I penned your name.

1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:39.026
- Ugh, did we just get robbed

1:17:39.026 --> 1:17:41.859
by terrible hip hop cover artists?

1:17:43.953 --> 1:17:45.730
- Dammit, man.

1:17:45.730 --> 1:17:46.865
- They're gone.

1:17:46.865 --> 1:17:48.621
I can't see 'em anywhere.

1:17:48.621 --> 1:17:50.511
- Fuck.
- Freaking gangsters.

1:17:50.511 --> 1:17:52.427
- Who cares, man?

1:17:52.427 --> 1:17:53.862
- What the hell are you doing man?

1:17:53.862 --> 1:17:54.695
What're you doing?

1:17:54.695 --> 1:17:57.187
- If I'm gonna die, I'm not dying sober.

1:17:57.187 --> 1:17:59.461
- Why are you talking about dying?

1:17:59.461 --> 1:18:01.511
- Hey, you know what? Forget all that.

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:03.863
How long have you been
jacking off in my office, Gus?

1:18:03.863 --> 1:18:06.582
- Four months.
- Every day?

1:18:06.582 --> 1:18:07.415
- Yeah.

1:18:07.415 --> 1:18:11.196
- Dude, if we survive
today, I'm firing you, okay?

1:18:11.196 --> 1:18:13.251
- But I had the best intentions.

1:18:13.251 --> 1:18:14.819
I, you wouldn't get the camera fixed

1:18:14.819 --> 1:18:16.961
so I installed a motion detector camera.

1:18:16.961 --> 1:18:19.790
And you know, I figured I'd
use a channel on my girlfriend.

1:18:19.790 --> 1:18:22.386
- Last week I thought
somebody dropped a glaze donut

1:18:22.386 --> 1:18:23.338
on my carpet.

1:18:23.338 --> 1:18:25.528
Turns out the stain is
from your dick juice?

1:18:25.528 --> 1:18:26.886
- I said, I was sorry.

1:18:26.886 --> 1:18:28.922
What do you want from me?

1:18:28.922 --> 1:18:30.878
- Kiss my ass, Gus.
- Wait, hold on, hold on.

1:18:30.878 --> 1:18:32.716
Did you just say that
the web camera records

1:18:32.716 --> 1:18:34.767
once the motion detectors
have been activated?

1:18:34.767 --> 1:18:36.155
- Yeah, I can pull it up on my computer

1:18:36.155 --> 1:18:37.532
or my phone either or.

1:18:37.532 --> 1:18:38.648
- Dude, pull it out right now!

1:18:38.648 --> 1:18:40.346
- Guys, come on.
- Follow you.

1:18:40.346 --> 1:18:41.679
- [Gus] Come on.

1:18:43.105 --> 1:18:45.762
What are you guys looking for?

1:18:45.762 --> 1:18:47.262
- Let me see that.

1:18:51.147 --> 1:18:52.897
Who the fuck is that?

1:19:04.202 --> 1:19:06.367
- Shit, man, it was Shorty
this whole fucking time.

1:19:06.367 --> 1:19:09.597
- Boy, I'm gonna break my
foot off in his asshole.

1:19:09.597 --> 1:19:11.163
- Does this still mean I'm fired?

1:19:11.163 --> 1:19:16.163
(knocking at the door)
(suspenseful music)

1:19:18.745 --> 1:19:19.762
- What's up man?

1:19:19.762 --> 1:19:21.089
- What's up fellas?

1:19:21.089 --> 1:19:22.963
Looks like we meet again, huh?

1:19:22.963 --> 1:19:23.963
Search them.

1:19:24.859 --> 1:19:26.005
- What the hell man?
- Arms up.

1:19:26.005 --> 1:19:27.422
- Dude, language.

1:19:32.653 --> 1:19:34.731
- Yeah, we thought we'd make
it easy on you guys, man.

1:19:34.731 --> 1:19:36.089
Where's the money?

1:19:36.089 --> 1:19:37.860
- Look, man, we don't have your money.

1:19:37.860 --> 1:19:39.197
- What do you mean you don't have it?

1:19:39.197 --> 1:19:41.860
- Man, does he stutter? We don't
have your money, all right?

1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:42.693
Ow!

1:19:42.693 --> 1:19:44.345
- [Altogether] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:19:44.345 --> 1:19:46.583
- Look, we got robbed, okay? Again.

1:19:46.583 --> 1:19:49.556
- You two idiots must
take us for fools, huh?

1:19:49.556 --> 1:19:52.031
Either you two pieces of
shit are fucking liars

1:19:52.031 --> 1:19:53.476
or you guys just got
the worst luck in hell.

1:19:53.476 --> 1:19:54.309
Which one is it?

1:19:54.309 --> 1:19:56.672
- Look, man, we know Playa
Playa doesn't play, okay?

1:19:56.672 --> 1:19:58.792
(Playa Playa laughs)
Player, Player, man,

1:19:58.792 --> 1:19:59.688
still using that name, huh?

1:19:59.688 --> 1:20:01.104
Letting it float around.

1:20:01.104 --> 1:20:01.963
Let me tell you something, man,

1:20:01.963 --> 1:20:04.462
that name's not on my birth
certificate, you feel me?

1:20:04.462 --> 1:20:05.778
Every time I hear that name,

1:20:05.778 --> 1:20:08.160
man, it gives me this touchy
feeling inside, you know?

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:09.507
From, from the gut.

1:20:09.507 --> 1:20:10.340
- Oh, have you ever thought

1:20:10.340 --> 1:20:12.073
about changing it up
a little bit you know?

1:20:12.073 --> 1:20:14.451
- Yeah, actually I have,
you know, I own an Island.

1:20:14.451 --> 1:20:16.591
It's about 350 miles off the coast.

1:20:16.591 --> 1:20:18.338
It's a nice little Caribbean spot.

1:20:18.338 --> 1:20:19.261
Was thinking about putting
in Italian restaurant.

1:20:19.261 --> 1:20:21.834
(Shorty whispers)
Yeah, whatever.

1:20:21.834 --> 1:20:23.069
Let me tell you guys something, man.

1:20:23.069 --> 1:20:25.800
Business is business and money's money.

1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:26.633
- Woo.

1:20:26.633 --> 1:20:28.029
- Been waiting all day for this.

1:20:28.029 --> 1:20:29.492
- Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait man.

1:20:29.492 --> 1:20:30.647
Okay, we know who stole your money, okay?

1:20:30.647 --> 1:20:31.662
We know who stole your money.

1:20:31.662 --> 1:20:33.455
- Who the fuck stole it then, huh?

1:20:33.455 --> 1:20:35.738
- This karate pirate motherfucker you got

1:20:35.738 --> 1:20:37.194
as a sidekick, that's who.

1:20:37.194 --> 1:20:39.067
- What you talking about
man, is that true, Shorty?

1:20:39.067 --> 1:20:39.900
- Hell no.

1:20:39.900 --> 1:20:41.035
- Dude, we have it on video.

1:20:41.035 --> 1:20:42.311
Okay, Gus.
- Right here.

1:20:42.311 --> 1:20:45.201
