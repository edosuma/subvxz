11:49.475 --> 11:51.242
Prince Yak will
hear yak.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.911
But snow worse
than yak ever seen.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.179
Yak know.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.181
Yak hungry too.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.250
Gummy, did you hear that?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.919
They can't make it work.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.355
Yaks stop swaying.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.223
Music over.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.292
If Twilight and the others
knew what was going on,

12:08.361 --> 12:10.561
they would be here to help
in a pony's heartbeat.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.062
I have to convince
Prince Rutherford

12:12.131 --> 12:14.231
that asking for help is OK.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.166
Will you help me, Gummy?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.568
Thank you!

12:17.637 --> 12:19.971
And see, asking you to
help wasn't hard at all!

12:23.343 --> 12:25.276
Pink Pony has
gathered you around

12:25.345 --> 12:28.512
the New Ceremonial
Yak Firepit...

12:28.581 --> 12:30.347
... to tell you a story.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.949
A yak tradition, right?

12:32.018 --> 12:33.951
[agreement]

12:34.020 --> 12:35.352
Yay!

12:35.421 --> 12:38.289
This is a story
about a group of...

12:38.358 --> 12:42.059
goats, who live
in the desert.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.361
There was a sandstorm
and their entire village

12:44.430 --> 12:46.463
was buried in sand.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.866
There was nothing they could do.

12:48.935 --> 12:53.037
They knew they could not survive
on only eating sand-wiches!

12:53.106 --> 12:54.839
Get it?

12:54.908 --> 12:57.842
OK.

12:57.911 --> 13:01.946
Anyway, finally, the goat's
brave, wise leader

13:02.015 --> 13:06.417
--let's just call
him Prince Drutherford--

13:06.486 --> 13:09.053
decides that they couldn't
do it by themselves.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.289
So he asked the neighboring
town of uh, Bovineville

13:12.358 --> 13:15.092
to come help them. Yeah! Cows!

13:15.161 --> 13:16.360
The magical cows
helped the goats.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.196
Everyone survived and
lived happily ever after.

13:19.265 --> 13:22.867
Because they asked for help.

13:22.936 --> 13:23.634
The end!

13:23.703 --> 13:26.637
[shouting]

13:26.706 --> 13:29.206
So what is the
moral of that story?

13:29.275 --> 13:32.009
Is it A: asking for
help is OK?

13:32.078 --> 13:35.379
B: asking for help
saves the day?

13:35.448 --> 13:39.250
Or C: asking for help
is good for everypony?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.385
D: goats weak
and horrible!

13:41.454 --> 13:44.922
Magic Bovines need to stay
out of goats' business!

13:44.991 --> 13:47.992
Um... not quite.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.461
Any-yak wanna shout
out another answer?

13:50.530 --> 13:53.530
[whistling wind]

13:53.599 --> 13:55.200
[groan]

13:58.604 --> 14:00.003
Pinkie: Hey,
Prince Rutherford.

14:00.072 --> 14:03.574
I want to talk to you about
something -- what are you doing?

14:03.643 --> 14:07.578
Yak snow bed got a
little melty last night.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.413
OK, yeah.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.548
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.585
You know, these yak snow
beds are the fluffiest

14:14.654 --> 14:15.920
I've ever slept in!

14:15.989 --> 14:17.088
They're so comfortable,

14:17.157 --> 14:19.223
you forget that it's just
a cold block of ice.

14:19.292 --> 14:22.026
And the yak snow
sandwiches, mmm, mmm!

14:22.095 --> 14:23.661
I hate it when food
burns your mouth

14:23.730 --> 14:25.963
or overwhelms
it with flavor.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.532
Oh! Yak hates that too.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.601
You know who would
really, really enjoy

14:30.670 --> 14:32.403
these snow sandwiches?

14:32.472 --> 14:34.672
Twilight Sparkle and
the other ponies!

14:34.741 --> 14:38.442
Oh! Hey, I have an idea!

14:38.511 --> 14:41.645
Why don't I go to Ponyville
and bring them back here?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.114
Ponies like snow sandwich?

14:44.183 --> 14:46.283
Ponies love snow
sandwiches!

14:46.352 --> 14:48.052
And, hey, while they're here,

14:48.121 --> 14:49.620
you can ask if they'll
clear the snow away.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.956
Fun, right?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.391
When Prince was little yak,

14:54.460 --> 14:57.094
Prince stomped on
ground too hard.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.630
Made deep hole and
fell into hole.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.032
Ice froze over hole.

15:02.101 --> 15:06.303
Prince waved to friends and
family from inside frozen hole.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.172
Waited for spring thaw.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.607
Prince survived on own.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.209
Wait a minute.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.645
You spent the whole
winter in a hole?

15:14.714 --> 15:17.282
Yes. And yak never
ask for help!

15:19.719 --> 15:22.419
OK, first of all, how did you
make such a deep hole

15:22.488 --> 15:23.754
from stomping?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.556
And how did it
freeze over so fast?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.458
And how could you see
your family and friends

15:27.527 --> 15:29.426
to wave to them from
inside a frozen hole?

15:29.495 --> 15:31.996
Even if all that was possible,
how did you breathe in there?

15:33.399 --> 15:35.533
YAKS DON'T ASK FOR HELP!

15:37.136 --> 15:38.635
But the yaks are hungry!

15:38.704 --> 15:40.704
And who knows when
the snow will melt?

15:40.773 --> 15:42.239
I just don't
understand why--

15:42.308 --> 15:47.378
Ah yes, is clear now that Pink
Pony does not understand Yaks!

15:47.447 --> 15:50.081
Honorary Yak status rescinded!

15:52.151 --> 15:54.284
Bang! Pretend there
is door!

15:54.353 --> 15:56.120
I just slammed it!

15:57.423 --> 15:59.090
Fine, be stubborn!

16:06.132 --> 16:08.165
Those yaks are so stubborn.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.567
They refuse to ask for help
even though they need it.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.369
Well, this Official
Friendship Ambassador

16:12.438 --> 16:14.671
is going to take matters
into her own hooves.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.040
I'll show them.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.110
You're right, Gummy.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.278
I am too worked up.

16:21.347 --> 16:24.548
A road trip game would
officially calm me down.

16:24.617 --> 16:25.583
I know!

16:25.651 --> 16:27.718
Let's play "Twenty
Million Questions."

16:27.787 --> 16:28.819
You think of something.

16:28.888 --> 16:30.654
Then I'll ask you twenty
million questions

16:30.723 --> 16:32.823
until I can come up with
what you're thinking of.

16:32.892 --> 16:33.791
Let's go!

16:33.860 --> 16:34.658
Is it blue?

16:34.727 --> 16:35.659
Is it green?

16:35.728 --> 16:36.660
Is it red?

16:36.729 --> 16:37.661
Is it greenish-red?

16:37.730 --> 16:38.562
Is it reddish-blue?

16:38.631 --> 16:39.496
Is it bigger than a bread box?

16:39.565 --> 16:40.197
Is it smaller than a bread box?

16:40.266 --> 16:41.665
Is it a bread box?

16:41.734 --> 16:42.666
Is it bread?

16:42.735 --> 16:43.567
Is it teeth?

16:43.636 --> 16:44.835
Is it Granny Smith's dentures?

16:44.904 --> 16:46.370
Is it you?

16:46.439 --> 16:47.337
Is it a rooster?

16:47.406 --> 16:48.439
Is it a red rooster?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.541
Is it a red rooster eating corn?

16:50.610 --> 16:53.177
Uhp, used up all twenty
million questions.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.479
Oh, well, we're here anyway!

16:58.784 --> 17:01.085
Official Pony
Balloon still here?

17:02.822 --> 17:06.691
Pink Pony gone because Pink
Pony not tough like yaks.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.660
Horn bump in agreement.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.595
Now!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.400
[chomp]

17:16.202 --> 17:17.001
Bleagh!

17:17.070 --> 17:18.869
Snow sandwich lose novelty.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.804
Snow couscous for dinner.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.773
[grunts]

17:23.509 --> 17:25.742
Then Prince Rutherford
said -- Bang!

17:25.811 --> 17:27.411
Pretend there is door!

17:27.480 --> 17:29.179
I just slammed it!

17:29.248 --> 17:29.980
Pinkie Pie--

17:30.049 --> 17:31.415
So then Pink
Pony said --

17:31.484 --> 17:33.784
Fine, be stubborn!

17:33.853 --> 17:36.520
Pinkie Pie, we have
to help the yaks!

17:36.589 --> 17:39.857
So in conclusion, we
have to help the yaks!

17:39.926 --> 17:41.325
Hmm?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.293
Just go with it, hon.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.761
Great idea, Pinkie.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.663
We'll be happy to
help the yaks.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.799
This is what friendship
is all about.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.801
Hey! I'll bring
apples.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.470
This season's batch
are extra juicy.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.838
And I shall provide the yaks

17:54.907 --> 17:57.374
with Equestria's
finest textiles.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.843
They'll be silky and
warm with hints of gold

17:59.912 --> 18:01.278
to compliment their horns.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.679
Stop!

18:02.748 --> 18:05.215
We can't bring the
yaks any pony stuff.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.550
Why not?

18:06.619 --> 18:08.652
The yaks are very proud.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.654
They won't ask for help.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.323
You know what they say, you
can lead a yak to water,

18:13.392 --> 18:15.626
but you better not let
him know you're doing it!

18:15.695 --> 18:17.561
Nopony says that.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.363
Do they?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.365
OK then, this will be an

not playing that!

18:33.846 --> 18:36.781
First, we have to
infiltrate the yak compound!
