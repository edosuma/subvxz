UNCONVENTIONALLY
YOU DID IT,

20:27.226 --> 20:28.493
YOU SAVED US.

20:28.493 --> 20:32.097
I MEAN, I GOT KICKED OUT
OF THE ORDER FOR PARTYING,

20:32.097 --> 20:34.833
BUT THIS PARTYING
IS WHAT SAVED ALL Y'ALL.

20:34.833 --> 20:38.870
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT
OF PARTS TO THIS KID:

NOT CONSIDERING

20:44.476 --> 20:46.044
REINSTATING

WE AREN'T CONSIDERING IT.

20:47.279 --> 20:48.747
WE'RE DOING IT.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.182

OF DISCIPLINE.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.383
IS EXACTLY
WHAT SAVED YOU

20:51.383 --> 20:55.520
FROM BECOMING
SOMEONE'S PREY.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.143
[MUSIC PLAYS]

21:18.143 --> 21:22.214

TELL GRAMPS ABOUT
ALL THIS, RIGHT?

21:22.214 --> 21:24.216
EH, I DON'T KNOW.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.245
THERE WAS NO ONE THERE.

21:53.245 --> 21:56.481
