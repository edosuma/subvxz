39:55.187 --> 39:57.022
KAI: <i>You don't exist.</i>

39:57.189 --> 39:59.608
You are nothing.

40:04.154 --> 40:07.866
In the eyes
of the unenlightened world.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.785
(SOBS QUIETLY)

40:15.874 --> 40:17.793
(BOX-CUTTER CLATTERS TO FLOOR)

40:23.882 --> 40:26.176
But to me...

40:27.177 --> 40:28.303
you're everything.

40:38.146 --> 40:40.065
You're the only one who sees me,

40:41.441 --> 40:43.902
who's not afraid to see the truth.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.155
You were right...

40:47.322 --> 40:49.157
about all of it.

40:49.992 --> 40:53.954
We have to accelerate our thinking,
get the entire country to pay attention,

40:54.121 --> 40:57.374
elevate me to the <i>national </i>stage.

40:57.541 --> 40:59.334
And only you...

41:00.752 --> 41:03.255
(EXHALES) You can do that.

41:04.548 --> 41:06.008
(PANTS)

41:06.175 --> 41:07.759
-Me?
-KAI: You.

41:07.926 --> 41:10.220
-But how?
-(KISSING)

41:16.602 --> 41:19.521
I need to be... assassinated.

41:21.899 --> 41:24.026
I can't kill you.

41:24.193 --> 41:26.111
(KISSING)

41:26.320 --> 41:28.947
You'll try... and fail.

41:29.531 --> 41:33.368
I'll be shot,
hospitalized, and then recover...

41:33.535 --> 41:35.621
stronger than ever.

41:40.542 --> 41:42.753
We're a Christian country.

(MOANING)

41:55.098 --> 41:57.309
But before you do that,

41:57.476 --> 42:00.062
I need you to bear witness.

42:00.229 --> 42:02.439
Which is why
I'm sending you to Ally.

42:02.606 --> 42:04.525
-(MEADOW MOANS)
-(KISSING)

42:04.691 --> 42:07.069
-You want me to lie to her?
-KAI: No.

42:07.236 --> 42:09.363
I want you to tell the truth...

42:09.530 --> 42:11.448
about all of it.

42:11.615 --> 42:13.909
Because when it comes
out of her mouth,

42:14.076 --> 42:16.954
that's when the truth
can hide in plain sight.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.622
(PANTS)

42:18.789 --> 42:21.542
Nobody will believe
what a crazy woman says.

(BOTH MOAN)

42:24.127 --> 42:27.047

42:38.058 --> 42:39.643
I'll crack under pressure.

42:39.810 --> 42:42.187
-KAI: No.
-I won't be able to lie to the police.

42:42.354 --> 42:45.065
No. You won't have to.

42:45.232 --> 42:47.901
It'll be our eternal secret.

42:48.068 --> 42:51.029
Our everlasting love.
