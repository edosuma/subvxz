00:29.684 --> 00:36.553
[♪♪♪]

00:39.901 --> 00:43.698
[Narrator] Ten years after the
collapse, society has crumbled.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.874
The future now a distant memory
of the past.

00:47.012 --> 00:49.428
The only commodity left
is violence,

00:49.566 --> 00:51.844
here, in Necropolis.

01:25.775 --> 01:31.712
[♪♪♪]

01:31.850 --> 01:35.578
[laughs]

01:43.965 --> 01:45.001
Ice.

01:45.139 --> 01:47.141
No water, no ice.

01:47.279 --> 01:48.763
Tomato juice, though.

01:54.631 --> 01:57.910
The best in all the land. Enjoy.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.226
[greaser spits]

02:03.364 --> 02:04.917
What are you,
some sort of biker gang?

02:05.987 --> 02:07.748
Wannabe Hells Angels types?

02:07.886 --> 02:10.682
[laughs]

02:10.820 --> 02:13.926
More like a bunch of rejects
from Saturday morning cartoons.

02:15.065 --> 02:17.309
Motorcycles are for poofs.

02:17.447 --> 02:18.655
We surf radio waves.

02:18.793 --> 02:20.657
[laughs]

02:22.176 --> 02:23.557
Cowabunga then, hombre.

02:24.834 --> 02:28.148
[groans]

02:33.946 --> 02:38.399
[indistinct chatter in
background] [audience cheering]

02:47.822 --> 02:51.757
[both laugh]

03:03.838 --> 03:07.670
[♪♪♪]

04:24.367 --> 04:28.302
[indistinct chatter
in background]

04:31.788 --> 04:34.550
I'd like to thank you all,
for your support.

04:34.688 --> 04:39.451
Here at the Warner Grand,
we operate 365 days a year

04:39.589 --> 04:43.352
between the hours of 12:15 p.m.
and midnight.

04:43.490 --> 04:45.319
We've got a little something
for everybody.

04:45.457 --> 04:47.942
So, bring your family,
come again.

04:54.673 --> 04:55.812
[Lucky]
Hey, George.

04:55.950 --> 04:57.814
[Lucky laughs]

04:57.952 --> 04:59.644
Lucky, my man!

04:59.782 --> 05:01.197
How's life treating you today?

05:01.335 --> 05:03.303
[Lucky] Oh. Like it caught me in
bed with its wife again.

05:03.441 --> 05:05.339
I know the feeling.

05:05.477 --> 05:07.514
[Lucky]
Gosh, that Hallyday.

05:07.652 --> 05:11.103
He's like a diamond
in a sea of glass, man.

05:11.241 --> 05:12.312
Amen.

05:12.450 --> 05:13.761
You know, I'd pay big bucks

05:13.899 --> 05:16.764
just to see him kick ass
and chew bubblegum again.

05:16.902 --> 05:18.732
You know, it's funny you should
mention that, brother.

05:18.870 --> 05:21.597
I just got off the phone
with his team, you know?

05:21.735 --> 05:24.220
And Hallyday is going
to make an appearance

05:24.358 --> 05:26.326
at the old Warner Grand.

05:27.706 --> 05:29.398
Can you picture it?

05:29.536 --> 05:32.055
The man
who saved the world thrice!

05:32.193 --> 05:34.472
Killed Dracula twice!

05:34.610 --> 05:36.577
Only got his heart broke
one time.

05:36.715 --> 05:37.992
[Lucky]
Oh!

05:38.130 --> 05:41.133
Claude Luc Hallyday.

05:42.859 --> 05:44.758
-[George chuckles]
-All right!

05:44.896 --> 05:47.139
[chuckles]

05:58.116 --> 05:59.738
[door knocks]

05:59.876 --> 06:01.084
Come on. Have a seat.

06:03.604 --> 06:05.330
Apologies
about the air conditioning.

06:05.468 --> 06:06.711
Popped the fuse.

06:11.681 --> 06:14.581
Yeah,
it says here you're a doctor?

06:14.719 --> 06:16.893
Yes, sir. A doctor of cinema.

06:17.031 --> 06:19.068
[clears throat] And the theater
is my hospital.

06:19.206 --> 06:20.380
I wrote my dissertation

06:20.518 --> 06:22.623
on Western
imperialist pop culture

06:22.761 --> 06:25.626
as a form of soft capitalism
in Taiwanese new wave.

06:25.764 --> 06:28.560
Like Bergman, Godard,
Tsai Ming-Liang.

06:28.698 --> 06:29.872
Those are films.

06:32.046 --> 06:36.016
This is the movie business.
It's the nitty gritty.

06:36.154 --> 06:40.192
You gotta make a dollar
from a nickel.

06:40.330 --> 06:41.849
Yes. Um,

06:41.987 --> 06:44.749
a lowly servant protecting
the audience's suspension

06:44.887 --> 06:47.752
of disbelief at all costs,
24 frames per second.

06:47.890 --> 06:49.443
See, you're saying
all the right things,

06:49.581 --> 06:51.445
but there's more to it
than that.

06:51.583 --> 06:55.829
This is-- this is a marriage,
a sacrifice, you know,

06:55.967 --> 06:57.520
through thick and thin.

06:57.658 --> 07:00.592
Sometimes, you gotta forego
eating dinner

07:00.730 --> 07:03.146
just to get
the concession stand filled.

07:03.284 --> 07:05.183
You know what I mean?

07:05.321 --> 07:07.427
Now, how do I know
that when things get rough,

07:09.187 --> 07:11.776
you ain't gonna just slip out
on me?

07:14.364 --> 07:16.021
Well, 'cause I got nowhere else
to go.

07:17.816 --> 07:19.059
Only place
I feel like I mattered

07:19.197 --> 07:20.819
is when I walked
through those doors.

07:22.718 --> 07:25.721
Listen, sir, when I am in,
I am all in.

07:27.619 --> 07:29.483
You start today.

07:29.621 --> 07:30.967
Can I ask what my pay will be?

07:33.211 --> 07:36.007
Well, I figured I'd start you
off as an intern

07:36.145 --> 07:39.562
and see how well you can swim
with the sharks.

07:40.839 --> 07:41.944
Welcome to the Warner Grand.

07:46.293 --> 07:50.539
[indistinct chatter]

07:50.677 --> 07:51.816
Okay.
Thank you very much, Spike.

07:53.127 --> 07:55.336
[sighs]

07:55.475 --> 07:56.855
Welcome. I'm George Fuller.

07:58.857 --> 08:02.654
My humblest apologies.
But let's get to it.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.276
Let me introduce you
to the Warner Grand.

08:06.002 --> 08:08.557
She was built in 1928
upon the Plaza's picturesque

08:08.695 --> 08:12.871
yet infamous courthouse square.

08:13.009 --> 08:17.289
It is to this day the longest,
continually in operation

08:17.427 --> 08:22.053
picture house in southwestern
United States of America.

08:22.191 --> 08:24.711
Now, she opened
her theater doors

08:24.849 --> 08:29.923
to the showing of a German film
in 1928 called

08:30.061 --> 08:31.476
"Metropolis"

08:31.614 --> 08:33.858
which we recently
did a screening of

08:33.996 --> 08:36.654
in celebration
of her 90th birthday.

08:38.345 --> 08:42.142
Here is some
of the film industry's finest

08:42.280 --> 08:46.318
artifacts of dismemberment
and pain.

08:49.839 --> 08:51.047
Like this right here.

08:56.397 --> 08:59.090
The Axe of Escoffier

08:59.228 --> 09:01.023
from the 1984

09:02.231 --> 09:04.716
vampire Nazi flick

09:04.854 --> 09:08.444
Blood is for the Living,
starring the Australian

09:08.582 --> 09:11.654
femme fatale, Loco Moco,

09:11.792 --> 09:14.208
and the Force
From The North himself,

09:14.346 --> 09:17.280
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday!

09:18.730 --> 09:21.457
Now, if y'all
are Hallyday's fans,

09:21.595 --> 09:24.011
I got something so special,
you will never see anything

09:24.149 --> 09:26.738
like this again
in a thousand galaxies.

09:26.876 --> 09:28.153
Hold on to your hats.
Come over here, y'all.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.224
Come, this way.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.950
Okay.

09:36.886 --> 09:39.924
The 1993 Gilera CX.

09:41.097 --> 09:42.616
Now, underneath this plastic

09:43.962 --> 09:49.174
is 125 two CC two-stroke engine

09:49.312 --> 09:53.454
revving freely to 12,000 RPM
to blast you

09:53.593 --> 09:55.284
into the stratosphere.

09:55.422 --> 09:57.079
Ciao bella!

09:57.217 --> 09:58.149
[George chuckles]

09:59.909 --> 10:01.393
Now, what makes this

10:01.531 --> 10:05.190
really special is the fact
that this is the only

10:05.328 --> 10:08.608
hero vehicle to survive
the making

10:08.746 --> 10:10.817
of the Stephen Berkowitz

10:10.955 --> 10:14.614
post-apocalyptic 1993 saga

10:14.752 --> 10:16.788
Necropolis,

10:16.926 --> 10:20.171
driven by none other
than the star himself,

10:20.309 --> 10:22.414
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday.

10:22.552 --> 10:24.554
Now, at the end of this month,
he's gonna do

10:24.693 --> 10:27.316
a special appearance
right here.

10:27.454 --> 10:28.420
Ain't that something?

10:30.630 --> 10:31.423
All right, folks.

10:32.977 --> 10:35.393
Please be kind enough
to pick up all your items

10:35.531 --> 10:36.843
on the way out.

10:36.981 --> 10:39.708
Don't forget to tip
old lovely Spike here,

10:39.846 --> 10:42.193
because like the Bible says,
man don't live

10:42.331 --> 10:43.401
on hot dogs alone.

10:43.539 --> 10:44.851
[chuckles]

10:44.989 --> 10:47.025
All right. This way, everyone.

10:47.163 --> 10:49.200
Thank you all so very much.

10:49.338 --> 10:51.167
Please come back.
Bring your families.

10:51.305 --> 10:52.444
Popcorn's on me.

10:56.794 --> 10:58.174
Hey, please don't touch my--

10:58.312 --> 11:00.383
Hi. How you doing?

11:00.521 --> 11:02.144
Oh, she told me a secret.

11:04.318 --> 11:06.182
See she lied to you
about her age.

11:08.184 --> 11:09.185
[scoffs]

11:09.323 --> 11:11.049
Excuse me?

11:11.187 --> 11:12.741
She was born in 1991.

11:13.983 --> 11:15.502
No, no, you're mistaken.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.678
She was 1993.

11:18.816 --> 11:20.576
I saw it on the manifold
when I bought it.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.821
No. It was marketed until '93.

11:24.373 --> 11:26.478
It was only built for one year.
And that was in '91.

11:27.859 --> 11:29.550
Wow. [chuckles]

11:29.689 --> 11:32.001
Well, you learn something new
every day, I guess.

11:33.175 --> 11:35.764
So, you fellas
a fan of the film?

11:35.902 --> 11:37.420
Always thought it was overrated.

11:40.078 --> 11:41.459
Can I take it for a spin?

11:41.597 --> 11:43.185
No. Please don't touch my bike.

11:44.427 --> 11:45.497
How much?

11:46.982 --> 11:48.569
I've never planned
on selling my bike.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.778
Not the bike.

11:49.916 --> 11:51.503
The entire establishment.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:56.198 --> 11:58.303
Y'all-- y'all--
you fellas are pulling--

11:58.441 --> 11:59.442
pulling my leg.

11:59.580 --> 12:00.512
This a prank or something?

12:03.101 --> 12:05.863
[sighs] We've been trying
to get a hold of you.

12:06.001 --> 12:07.312
You never returned our calls,
emails.

12:07.450 --> 12:10.868
Hell, we even found
an old fax line, nada.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.353
Well, I'm pretty much

12:13.491 --> 12:15.251
running this establishment
by myself.

12:15.389 --> 12:17.771
So, sometimes,
things fall through the cracks.

12:17.909 --> 12:18.910
Hey, friend.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.224
Don't be magnanimous
with our time.

12:22.362 --> 12:23.466
[sighs]

12:27.436 --> 12:30.094
I don't know
what magnanimous means.

12:30.232 --> 12:31.992
[Reed] We have
a development in the community.

12:33.580 --> 12:38.585
Our company would like to offer
you a very generous amount

12:38.723 --> 12:39.897
for this place.

12:41.588 --> 12:42.969
Okay, see, the thing--

12:43.107 --> 12:46.489
Excuse me, sir. Can we talk?

12:46.627 --> 12:50.355
Um, yes. Excuse us for a minute.

12:50.493 --> 12:52.081
Thank you. Come on.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.085
Think he will throw in the ride?

12:58.053 --> 12:59.502
I don't think
he's a gregarious type.

13:03.955 --> 13:07.131
Well, unfortunately,

13:07.269 --> 13:09.961
I've got some pressing matters
to attend to.

13:10.099 --> 13:13.862
So, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave and...

13:18.763 --> 13:20.420
These types of offers, you know,

13:22.525 --> 13:24.251
they don't come around
so much anymore.

13:28.186 --> 13:30.016
Be seeing you, Hollywood.

13:33.571 --> 13:37.955
[Reed whistling]

13:39.370 --> 13:40.509
[pants]

13:40.647 --> 13:42.338
[woman 1 screams]
Help!

13:42.476 --> 13:43.512
Help!

13:43.650 --> 13:47.619
[screaming]

13:49.449 --> 13:51.002
[both laughing]

13:51.140 --> 13:52.521
[Audience member 1]
Shut up, you punks!

13:52.659 --> 13:53.453
Suck my toes, grandma!

13:53.591 --> 13:55.179
[laughing]

13:55.317 --> 13:56.387
[sobs]

13:56.525 --> 13:57.595
[Woman 1]
No!

13:57.733 --> 14:01.564
[laughing]

14:01.702 --> 14:04.153
[male punk speaks indistinct]

14:11.574 --> 14:14.094
I'm sorry. But I'ma have to ask
you to leave.

14:14.232 --> 14:15.889
We don't get a warning
or something?

14:16.027 --> 14:17.615
I don't do warnings.

14:17.753 --> 14:19.375
Well, then we want a refund.

14:19.513 --> 14:21.653
-I don't do refunds.
-You're a thief, bro!

14:23.241 --> 14:25.416
Now, I'm not the snitching kind,

14:25.554 --> 14:27.728
but if you don't leave
my house of business,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.558
I will call the authorities.

14:29.696 --> 14:30.697
What's your problem, man?

14:30.835 --> 14:33.217
This isn't even yours.

14:33.355 --> 14:35.564
This is stolen land,
you colonizer.

14:35.702 --> 14:39.740
[inhales, exhales]

14:39.879 --> 14:41.673
[laughs]

14:44.159 --> 14:46.368
I don't know what to think
anymore, Spike.

14:48.232 --> 14:51.580
It's like this whole damn
world's gotten off its axis.

14:51.718 --> 14:53.409
You're telling me, boss.

14:53.547 --> 14:55.066
I hate punks, man.

14:55.204 --> 14:56.896
This place should be treated
like church.

14:58.552 --> 14:59.381
Amen, Doc.

15:00.865 --> 15:02.591
From your lips to God's ears.

15:04.869 --> 15:07.527
[punks clamoring]

15:07.665 --> 15:08.908
Excuse me.

15:12.152 --> 15:13.326
[male punk] Full of shit.
He's full of shit!

15:13.464 --> 15:14.637
[female punk]
Come on, man! Chill out!

15:14.775 --> 15:16.156
-Let's go!
-[grunts]

15:16.294 --> 15:17.606
-You're full of shit, bro!
-Come on, man! Stop!

15:17.744 --> 15:19.297
-Hey!
-What's up, man?

15:19.435 --> 15:20.747

George Fuller from the Warner.

I've been calling in regards
to Mr. Hallyday

17:56.903 --> 17:58.767
Hello, George.

17:58.905 --> 18:03.634
This is Lynn Schrader,
CEO of Schrader Industries.

18:03.772 --> 18:05.877
And I wanna welcome you
to Nirvana,

18:07.396 --> 18:09.640
an all-inclusive complex
coming straight

18:09.778 --> 18:11.918

18:18.338 --> 18:19.857

In the case of a pandemic
or terrorist attack,

18:21.962 --> 18:25.483

we would rely on our own grid.

18:26.829 --> 18:30.523
Once you find Nirvana,
you will find yourself.

18:31.972 --> 18:33.491
Welcome to the future.

18:35.321 --> 18:37.357
We're gonna change the world,
George.

18:37.495 --> 18:38.876
You could be a part of it.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.429
All you have to do is sign
on the dotted line.

18:42.845 --> 18:45.538
What if the world
didn't really need to change?

18:47.229 --> 18:50.094
Isn't change the whole point
of life?

18:50.232 --> 18:52.683
Either you evolve or you die.

18:52.821 --> 18:54.685
If I'm honest,

18:54.823 --> 18:57.515
I enjoy a good game
of mental gymnastics.

18:57.653 --> 18:59.483
A few sharp barbs
between combatants,

18:59.621 --> 19:02.037
and then everyone walks away
with what they want.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.971
So, when is a gift
no longer a gift?

19:05.109 --> 19:07.870
Oh. See, that's where you and I
differ, George.

19:08.008 --> 19:09.734
I'm much more altruistic.

19:09.872 --> 19:11.874
See, I have great vision
for this part of the country.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.430
A new frontier, so to speak.

19:15.568 --> 19:17.121
What I'm about to say
to you pertains directly

19:17.259 --> 19:18.398
to your business.

19:18.536 --> 19:20.849
The first camera,
the Kinetograph,

19:20.987 --> 19:23.369
was born from Edison's
entrepreneurialism 10 years

19:23.507 --> 19:26.337
after the great success
of the Phonograph,

19:26.475 --> 19:28.443
only to be replaced
with the Kinetoscope

19:28.581 --> 19:30.548
to view the moving picture.

19:30.686 --> 19:34.173
This art form you so revere
was never about car chases

19:34.311 --> 19:37.486
or Oscar-worthy monologues.

19:37.624 --> 19:41.249
It was merely an opportunity
to sell a new piece of hardware,

19:41.387 --> 19:43.458

19:43.596 --> 19:46.530

indium-tin oxide.

19:48.152 --> 19:49.084
See, I don't run a college.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.741
I run a business.

19:51.914 --> 19:54.917
It's the same business
that the taco guy

19:55.055 --> 19:57.299
down the street is in.

19:57.437 --> 20:00.026
The same business
that the steel mill

20:00.164 --> 20:02.511
was running around the corner.

20:04.341 --> 20:08.241
I just happen to sell pictures,
and-- and fantasies,

20:08.379 --> 20:11.762
and maybe 90-minute vacations
to escape

20:11.900 --> 20:14.385
from all that madness
in the street.

20:16.111 --> 20:19.804
Whether you see it or not,
they-- they know my value.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.980
I'm not so sure

20:23.118 --> 20:26.225
that your neighbors
would agree, George.

20:26.363 --> 20:28.917
Most of them are quite eager
to sign on the dotted line,

20:29.055 --> 20:31.782

unless you relinquish ownership.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.821

20:51.698 --> 20:53.700

20:53.838 --> 20:58.602

I have a matinee to attend to.

It's for the convent

You don't strike me
as the religious type.

28:59.082 --> 29:01.118

29:01.256 --> 29:03.293
I was in the Oriole
organization.

29:03.431 --> 29:07.642
And I went 6-1 with a 1.8 ERA. I
was hot shit.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.920

Why don't you keep that ring?
It's on the house.

29:11.957 --> 29:13.510
It's very generous of you.

29:13.648 --> 29:18.066
But to make it in the show,
you need something special.

So, during the offseason,
I added a pitch to my arsenal.

Got my fastball up to 95,

29:26.557 --> 29:28.836

at nearly seven.

and um, you're family to us.

47:29.018 --> 47:30.537
I had quite the hard
relationship

47:30.675 --> 47:31.641
with my family, though.

47:32.988 --> 47:34.955
[sighs]

47:35.093 --> 47:37.613
Yeah.
But this is the biggest thing

47:37.751 --> 47:40.478
that's happened to any of us in
our entire lives.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.516
I swear to you,
you are in-- in--

47:44.654 --> 47:45.863
in good hands, sir.

47:49.038 --> 47:52.662
Uh, okay. I trust you, George.

47:54.492 --> 47:55.700
Thank you.

47:55.838 --> 47:57.253
Thank you, sir.

47:57.391 --> 47:59.704
I'll be back in um--
with a five-minute warning.

47:59.842 --> 48:00.947
[Claude]
Thank you.

48:11.681 --> 48:14.753
[indistinct chatter]

48:14.892 --> 48:16.238
Okay.

48:27.628 --> 48:31.149
Hello, everyone.
My name is George Fuller.

48:31.287 --> 48:35.222
I'm the proprietor
of this, uh, this picture house.

48:36.775 --> 48:39.123
Well, before we get started,
um...

48:45.750 --> 48:48.787
...I'd like to share
with you all a quote.

48:48.926 --> 48:51.411
It's from the trailblazing
godfather

48:51.549 --> 48:54.932
of independent cinema himself,
Mr. Orson Welles.

48:56.416 --> 49:00.972
He stated that,
"If you want a happy ending,

49:02.560 --> 49:05.183
it all depends
upon where you stop your story."

49:06.564 --> 49:10.602
I tell you we could stop
the story right now and

49:12.294 --> 49:14.261
I'd be as happy as a clam
at high tide.

49:16.332 --> 49:18.162
But enough of my jibber jabber.

49:18.300 --> 49:20.198
For the main event,

49:20.336 --> 49:23.822
now, you have seen him
single-handedly

49:23.961 --> 49:26.618
foil Nazi plots,

49:26.756 --> 49:29.138
delivered a pair
of conjoined twins

49:29.276 --> 49:31.278
in the Sahara Desert.

49:32.659 --> 49:37.043
He sent hordes of vampires
to their perilous demise.

49:37.181 --> 49:40.839
And he is the very first

49:40.978 --> 49:42.738
actor to copulate

49:42.876 --> 49:45.810
with a robot on film.

49:45.948 --> 49:50.263
The film Crude Circuitry
and the coming of an atomic age

49:50.401 --> 49:52.990
was one of the
most ground-breaking films

49:53.128 --> 49:54.405
ever put together.

49:54.543 --> 49:56.821
Ladies and gentlemen,

49:56.959 --> 50:01.412
let's welcome the Force
From The North himself,

50:01.550 --> 50:04.691
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday!

50:04.829 --> 50:08.419
[audience cheering]

50:11.629 --> 50:13.389
Hell, yeah!

50:23.606 --> 50:24.262
Hello.

50:24.400 --> 50:27.541
[groans softly, sighs]

50:29.026 --> 50:30.510
Apologies. I--

50:32.029 --> 50:33.306
I don't really get out
much anymore.

50:33.444 --> 50:36.240
So, I'm a little rusty.

50:39.070 --> 50:42.763
I try to stay in locales
with air indexes below 10.

50:42.901 --> 50:45.214
Estonia mostly these days.

50:45.352 --> 50:47.320
Well, not just for

50:47.458 --> 50:49.425
the affordable
high level of oxygen,

50:49.563 --> 50:53.188
but for the plethora of saunas.

50:54.465 --> 50:57.261
Many people feel the sauna
was invented

50:57.399 --> 50:58.331
in neighboring Finland.

50:58.469 --> 51:01.748
No, it was actually in Estonia,

51:01.886 --> 51:04.751
where that word was first used.

51:04.889 --> 51:07.443
Well, roughly around 2,000 B.C.

51:11.723 --> 51:13.691

-[laughs]

51:37.818 --> 51:39.751
I told you
he wasn't a tough guy.

51:42.133 --> 51:44.066
Mr. Claude Luc Hallyday,
everybody!

51:44.204 --> 51:45.205
He's still got it.

51:45.343 --> 51:47.104
-[audience cheers]
-[laughs]

51:47.242 --> 51:48.657
Ciao bella!

51:51.798 --> 51:55.767
[♪♪♪]

52:13.820 --> 52:14.717
[car door closes]

52:20.275 --> 52:21.552
You're late.

52:23.519 --> 52:26.212
You should get yourself
a decent watch next time.

52:26.350 --> 52:28.145
[Cyberella]
Play nice.

52:28.283 --> 52:29.249
[Well-dressed man]
Nice, why?

52:31.286 --> 52:34.461
He ain't nothing but a bunch
of scrap metal put together.

52:37.015 --> 52:38.810
I'm here for the 100 gig.

52:38.948 --> 52:40.226
RAM upgrade.

52:40.364 --> 52:41.951
What am I running here? A zoo?

52:43.539 --> 52:45.645
How do I know
you ain't a cop, boy?

52:45.783 --> 52:47.060
Oink. Oink.

52:47.198 --> 52:48.406
Well...

52:50.719 --> 52:51.582
...check it out.

52:58.416 --> 52:59.555
Look at that.

53:02.972 --> 53:04.215
Ooh.

53:08.012 --> 53:11.567
[woman laughing]

53:16.607 --> 53:19.057
[Well-dressed man]
Damn!

53:19.196 --> 53:21.922
You got yourself a deal, chico.

53:22.060 --> 53:23.303
Enjoy your upgrade.

53:23.441 --> 53:27.997
[♪♪♪]

53:39.354 --> 53:40.320
Wait.

53:41.563 --> 53:42.805
Where did you find this?

53:42.943 --> 53:47.258
[sighs] I found that at an
estate sale

53:47.396 --> 53:48.915
from the armorer himself.

53:49.053 --> 53:52.332
Oh. Tristano.

53:52.470 --> 53:54.334
Yeah.

53:54.472 --> 53:56.785
One of the few men
I called a friend.

53:56.923 --> 53:59.236
Supposedly, he found
this fossilized

53:59.374 --> 54:00.720
in the cave of Altamira.

54:01.997 --> 54:03.309
Wait.

54:03.447 --> 54:06.243
The Axe of Escoffier
was found in a-- a cave?

54:06.381 --> 54:09.246
-It's real?
-Correction.

54:09.384 --> 54:11.248
It's not an axe.
This is a halberd.

54:13.974 --> 54:15.528
See the inscription here?

54:20.947 --> 54:24.606
"I naur -o I coe,

54:24.744 --> 54:27.609
Im tur- feel ha in nin loins."

54:27.747 --> 54:30.991
It means the fire of the earth,

54:32.130 --> 54:33.787
I feel it in my loins.

54:33.925 --> 54:35.479
My God!

54:39.206 --> 54:41.692
Wow. Is this...

54:43.280 --> 54:47.387
Damn right, it is. Iraqnophobia.

54:49.458 --> 54:51.046
I lost all the hairs on my ass

54:51.184 --> 54:53.635
when that flame thrower stunt
went south in that picture.

54:53.773 --> 54:54.808
[laughs]

54:54.946 --> 54:59.882
Straight through my pants.
[chuckles]

55:00.020 --> 55:02.333
We didn't fake war on that one.
Huh?

55:02.471 --> 55:04.508
Gaspar threw us smack dab
in the middle

55:04.646 --> 55:06.993
of the Indonesian Revolution
against Sukarno,

55:07.131 --> 55:08.339
and yelled, "Action!"

55:08.477 --> 55:13.102
[♪♪♪]

55:22.698 --> 55:25.080
[George]
I-- I memorized your, um--

55:25.218 --> 55:29.049
the opening monologue you gave
to the-- to the infantry.

55:29.187 --> 55:30.810
Oh, yeah. To the infantry.

55:30.948 --> 55:32.121
[George]
Yes!

55:32.259 --> 55:33.364
[chuckles]

55:33.502 --> 55:34.365
Well, let's see.

55:34.503 --> 55:38.576
[clears throat, exhales]

55:38.714 --> 55:42.062
"We sit here,
each someone's child,

55:43.719 --> 55:46.688
asked by masters of war
to play protectors of the realm.

55:47.999 --> 55:51.175
Asked to act as if we love
the smell of blood

55:51.313 --> 55:54.972
and embrace death
like our own mother's bosom.

55:55.110 --> 55:58.182
But the house
is betting against us,

55:58.320 --> 56:01.841
that we will die here
in this prison of sand and oil.

56:01.979 --> 56:04.153
Not today, I say.

56:04.291 --> 56:06.501
Not today.

56:06.639 --> 56:09.158
We will live to see
the sunrise over Baghdad.

56:10.401 --> 56:12.541
And this time next year,

56:12.679 --> 56:14.509
I shall be back
for the harvest, Mom.

56:17.235 --> 56:18.513
I can't wait to see your face.

56:19.652 --> 56:22.448
As the silk tassels of corn

56:22.586 --> 56:25.520
go from green to brown."

56:29.731 --> 56:31.180
Mr. Hallyday, um,

56:33.010 --> 56:37.670
I swear you were robbed
of the Academy Award that year.

56:39.050 --> 56:40.189
[sighs]

56:40.327 --> 56:42.122
Yeah.

56:42.260 --> 56:43.503
[chuckles softly]

56:43.641 --> 56:45.471
Yeah. It was the only time
I was nominated.

56:45.609 --> 56:47.507
Shit. Now, that's a shame in
itself.

56:49.302 --> 56:50.855
Do you mind if I take it?

56:50.993 --> 56:53.720
Oh, man! Mi casa, su casa.

56:53.858 --> 56:56.102
[laughs]

56:56.240 --> 56:57.414
Take it for a spin.

56:59.588 --> 57:01.694
Take it for a spin.

57:04.766 --> 57:06.733
You didn't think we'd really let
you leave alive

57:06.871 --> 57:08.494
with our product in your head.

57:08.632 --> 57:10.703
I didn't think you would,
Cyberella.

57:12.083 --> 57:13.637
But I will.

57:18.089 --> 57:20.885

57:38.316 --> 57:40.905
For some reason,
I want to let you live.

57:42.389 --> 57:44.253
I've been known
to have that effect on women.

57:45.910 --> 57:47.394
And even some men.

57:47.533 --> 57:49.500
I think today
might be your Lucky day.

[gun shots]

57:50.950 --> 57:53.159

and blood to be human, Alex.

58:00.304 --> 58:02.824
You got nowhere to run, boy!

for the excellent curation.

58:44.866 --> 58:46.281
[Burton chuckles]

58:46.419 --> 58:47.834
[Burton] That brought back
some fond memories

58:47.972 --> 58:49.318
of the summer it came out.

58:51.079 --> 58:53.771
I got to third base
with a cutie, James Claudio,

58:53.909 --> 58:56.843
at a matinee showing.
of Walter Hill's the Driver.

you know that?

59:12.169 --> 59:13.135
A real freak.

59:14.689 --> 59:17.554
Yeah. See, what I think
is I think that this theater

59:17.692 --> 59:20.073
is like your deep,
dark, Freudian kink.

59:21.523 --> 59:22.973
I think you need help.

59:23.111 --> 59:25.354
[toilet flushes]

59:30.877 --> 59:31.844
[Burton]
What?

59:33.915 --> 59:35.779
Please remember

59:35.917 --> 59:39.230
to silence your phone
before you re-enter the theater.

59:39.368 --> 59:40.404
[water running]

59:40.542 --> 59:41.370

I'm sorry about that.

Here at the Warner Grand,

Now, that's the first time
a human being

59:58.422 --> 59:59.665
fornicated with a robot.

I didn't know there was an
interactive aspect

01:00:58.551 --> 01:00:59.863
to tonight's festivities.

01:01:00.001 --> 01:01:02.175
You sure those are firing right?

01:01:02.313 --> 01:01:04.488
We might need a new battery
in them or something.

Where were they?

was my first love.

01:01:39.143 --> 01:01:41.628
As a young man, I starred
in a production of Arcadia

01:01:41.767 --> 01:01:43.251
on the west end.

01:01:45.356 --> 01:01:47.496
Dingleberries.

[Claude]
Care to elaborate?

01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:52.122
It's this psycho developer chick

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.712
who's just determined
to take my establishment.

01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.541
So, sell it to her.

01:01:57.679 --> 01:01:59.957
This is my home, man!

01:02:00.095 --> 01:02:01.959
But we should call
the authorities.

01:02:02.097 --> 01:02:04.548
She's in cahoots
with the authorities.

01:02:04.686 --> 01:02:06.999
Hence, my face.

01:02:07.137 --> 01:02:09.967
I gotta get my people
from out of that damn theater.

This popsicle stand
is about to blow.

You-- you got real
combat training, right?

01:02:17.009 --> 01:02:19.425
Those black belts,
that's real, right?

Look, you'll be fine.

Time to refresh yourself
and visit our snack bar.

Got a yen for hot popcorn?
