<i>In the far north,</i>

00:38.520 --> 00:41.319
<i>after three dark months of winter,</i>

00:47.080 --> 00:49.515
<i>a world is waiting</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:54.639
<i>for a trigger.</i>

00:57.080 --> 00:59.640
<i>The sunshine of spring.</i>

01:11.480 --> 01:14.917
<i>Starfish are the first to respond.</i>

01:26.360 --> 01:28.431
<i>They race for the highest point,</i>

01:32.120 --> 01:34.191
<i>and, sensing changes in the water,</i>

01:34.600 --> 01:36.831
<i>with the tips of their tube feet,</i>

01:39.280 --> 01:40.600
<i>they spawn.</i>

01:57.800 --> 01:59.917

02:00.760 --> 02:02.319
<i>now emerge.</i>

02:12.560 --> 02:16.076
<i>They collect as many</i>
<i>starfish eggs as they can.</i>

02:30.120 --> 02:33.830
<i>Which is quite a lot</i>
<i>when you've got ten arms.</i>

02:45.080 --> 02:46.719
<i>Now sea pens</i>

02:46.840 --> 02:48.797
<i>rise up to claim a share.</i>

02:59.200 --> 03:00.429
<i>The creatures here</i>

03:00.520 --> 03:03.911
<i>must grab what they can</i>
<i>of this annual banquet.</i>

03:08.600 --> 03:10.990
<i>For the light has also set in motion,</i>

03:11.080 --> 03:14.357
<i>the greatest transformation of all.</i>

03:17.800 --> 03:19.120
<i>Fronds of kelp,</i>

03:19.320 --> 03:22.154
<i>a marine alga, rise towards the surface,</i>

03:22.440 --> 03:24.796
<i>lifted by their gas-filled bladders.</i>

03:37.520 --> 03:41.196
<i>Soon, a marine forest has materialised.</i>

03:45.400 --> 03:48.313
<i>Teeming with life of all kinds,</i>

03:53.160 --> 03:55.356
<i>these green seas</i>

03:55.440 --> 03:59.559
<i>are some of the most productive</i>

<i>in all the oceans.</i>

<i>Barely visible, except for</i>
<i>the pulsating siphons</i>

05:02.880 --> 05:04.109
<i>through which it breathes,</i>

05:05.320 --> 05:09.109
<i>a common octopus waiting for prey</i>
<i>to pass by.</i>

05:14.200 --> 05:15.680
<i>A crab will do.</i>

05:23.200 --> 05:25.476
<i>The octopus sets of in pursuit.</i>

05:57.320 --> 05:58.993
<i>And then lurks</i>

06:00.400 --> 06:02.756
<i>with the patience of an ambush hunter.</i>

06:28.440 --> 06:31.399
<i>But the octopus shares the Cape waters</i>

06:31.600 --> 06:34.593
<i>with a great concentration</i>
<i>of other predators.</i>

06:42.280 --> 06:43.555
<i>Fur seals,</i>

06:45.520 --> 06:46.670
<i>and sharks.</i>

06:50.960 --> 06:52.474
<i>They all eat octopus,</i>

06:54.160 --> 06:55.355
<i>if they can find one.</i>

07:04.680 --> 07:07.036
<i>And Pyjama Sharks are experts</i>

07:09.600 --> 07:11.512
<i>at hunting in the undergrowth.</i>

07:20.320 --> 07:22.789
<i>Time to disappear.</i>

07:28.920 --> 07:31.116
<i>But these tough-skinned little sharks</i>

07:31.200 --> 07:34.671
<i>are small enough to reach deep</i>
<i>into crevices.</i>

07:54.200 --> 07:56.669
<i>But the octopus is far from finished.</i>

08:00.160 --> 08:03.551
<i>She slips her tentacles</i>
<i>into the shark's gills.</i>

08:04.880 --> 08:07.395
<i>That prevents the shark from breathing.</i>

08:11.520 --> 08:13.910
<i>So the shark has to let go.</i>

08:25.560 --> 08:28.758
<i>When caught out</i>
<i>in the open and vulnerable,</i>

08:28.880 --> 08:32.794
<i>this octopus does something</i>
<i>truly extraordinary,</i>

08:34.080 --> 08:36.356
<i>and never recorded before.</i>

08:47.080 --> 08:48.958
<i>She disguises herself</i>

08:51.840 --> 08:54.309
<i>with a protective armour of shells.</i>

08:59.440 --> 09:00.669
<i>She's hiding</i>

09:01.600 --> 09:03.273
<i>in plain sight.</i>

09:14.080 --> 09:16.276
<i>The shark can sense its prey.</i>

09:30.440 --> 09:32.033
<i>But the shells confuse it.</i>

09:39.360 --> 09:42.034
<i>In a forest full of hungry mouths,</i>

09:43.000 --> 09:46.630
<i>superior wits allow this octopus</i>
<i>to stay alive.</i>

09:58.320 --> 10:00.073

10:19.760 --> 10:21.956
<i>Here, the biggest kelps of all</i>

10:22.080 --> 10:24.117

10:32.360 --> 10:33.680
<i>In some places,</i>

10:33.840 --> 10:37.914
<i>the giant fronds rise up</i>
<i>to 60 metres tall.</i>

10:44.360 --> 10:46.113
<i>The thickets they create</i>

10:46.360 --> 10:47.919
<i>are crowded with life.</i>

10:56.280 --> 10:59.751
<i>Competition here for space and food</i>

10:59.880 --> 11:01.280
<i>is intense.</i>

11:14.640 --> 11:16.199
<i>A challenging problem</i>

11:16.560 --> 11:18.677
<i>for the Garibaldi fish.</i>

11:25.280 --> 11:27.954
<i>He tends to his patch of seaweed</i>

11:28.200 --> 11:30.715
<i>filled with tiny creatures that he eats.</i>

11:40.200 --> 11:41.919
<i>As with most farmers,</i>

11:42.280 --> 11:44.078
<i>his work never ends.</i>

11:49.240 --> 11:52.392
<i>He removes snails and any other grazers</i>

11:52.640 --> 11:54.438
<i>that come to eat his algae.</i>

12:13.000 --> 12:15.117
<i>No matter how big they are.</i>

12:25.520 --> 12:29.070
<i>He has to deal with pests of all kinds.</i>

12:32.240 --> 12:34.277
<i>This can be the worst of them.</i>

12:34.520 --> 12:39.515
<i>Sea urchins that can scrape off</i>
<i>every vestige of algae from a rock.</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:42.911
<i>Its spines are needle sharp.</i>

12:46.160 --> 12:49.073
<i>Somehow the Garibaldi must remove it.</i>

13:02.520 --> 13:05.035
<i>But the problem with sea urchins</i>

13:10.320 --> 13:12.676
<i>is that they just keep coming.</i>

13:28.160 --> 13:31.073
<i>When evening arrives</i>
<i>and the light fades,</i>

13:31.200 --> 13:34.796
<i>he has to stop.</i>
<i>He not only needs a rest,</i>

13:34.920 --> 13:36.718
<i>he needs to hide.</i>

13:41.320 --> 13:42.913
<i>Because at night,</i>

13:43.160 --> 13:45.994
<i>predators prowl through these forests.</i>

13:50.520 --> 13:52.000
<i>A Torpedo Ray,</i>

14:08.880 --> 14:10.951
<i>While the Garibaldi hides,</i>

14:12.440 --> 14:15.433
<i>the urchins can feed</i>
<i>without interruption.</i>

14:24.680 --> 14:26.672
<i>The light returns,</i>

14:30.920 --> 14:33.754
<i>and he finds his farm is once again</i>

14:33.840 --> 14:35.115
<i>under attack.</i>

14:50.920 --> 14:53.116
<i>Urchins like locusts,</i>

14:53.520 --> 14:55.751
<i>have the ability to swarm</i>

15:02.880 --> 15:05.315
<i>and this can be disastrous</i>

15:05.440 --> 15:06.999
<i>not just for the Garibaldi,</i>

15:07.160 --> 15:09.231
<i>but for the kelp forest itself.</i>

15:22.400 --> 15:25.518
<i>All the vegetation is now under attack.</i>

15:54.880 --> 15:57.349
<i>The urchins move through the forest</i>

15:57.560 --> 15:59.631
<i>cutting through the kelp fronds</i>

15:59.800 --> 16:03.111
<i>and leaving behind vast barrens.</i>

16:06.680 --> 16:08.160
<i>These urchin armies</i>

17:00.200 --> 17:02.431

17:02.520 --> 17:04.512
<i>is not a very good swimmer.</i>

17:06.839 --> 17:09.480
<i>grooming its fur to make it buoyant.</i>

17:16.240 --> 17:18.709
<i>But to provide her youngster with milk,</i>

<i>She does that by eating shellfish.</i>

17:52.200 --> 17:56.956
<i>And urchins are among a sea otter's</i>
<i>favourite delicacies.</i>

18:15.360 --> 18:19.877
<i>In the past, sea otters were hunted</i>
<i>so intensively for their fur,</i>

18:20.000 --> 18:22.231

18:27.240 --> 18:28.560

<i>And just by keeping the turtles</i>

30:14.880 --> 30:18.032
<i>Now, as the Australian summer</i>
<i>draws to an end,</i>

30:18.720 --> 30:21.394
<i>they have one last act to complete.</i>

30:25.560 --> 30:27.040
<i>To find a mate.</i>

30:32.120 --> 30:34.919
<i>But there are</i>
<i>over one hundred thousand males</i>

30:35.680 --> 30:38.149
<i>competing for the arriving females</i>

30:38.240 --> 30:39.640
<i>in this one bay.</i>

30:45.960 --> 30:48.998
<i>Among them, a giant, a true goliath.</i>

30:49.600 --> 30:52.195
<i>He probably weighs about ten kilos.</i>

30:55.880 --> 30:58.554
<i>Bands of colour sweep across his skin.</i>

30:59.200 --> 31:01.192
<i>That's how cuttlefish communicate.</i>

31:21.080 --> 31:24.630
<i>This smaller male couldn't</i>
<i>possibly take him on.</i>

31:34.280 --> 31:37.034
<i>Beside Goliath and under his protection,</i>

31:37.560 --> 31:40.120
<i>a female who has just mated with him.</i>

31:43.520 --> 31:46.638
<i>But other rivals are still interested.</i>

31:50.440 --> 31:53.717
<i>It seems a small male</i>
<i>wouldn't stand a chance.</i>

31:55.960 --> 31:58.680
<i>The female is now displaying</i>
<i>a white stripe</i>

31:58.760 --> 32:01.275
<i>along her side nearest Goliath.</i>

32:04.520 --> 32:08.036
<i>It's a clear signal that she no longer</i>
<i>wants to mate with him.</i>

32:13.360 --> 32:16.831
<i>It's all the encouragement</i>
<i>that the little male needs.</i>

32:39.960 --> 32:42.156
<i>He's going to have to use trickery.</i>

32:57.080 --> 32:59.311
<i>He tones down his colours,</i>

33:00.080 --> 33:02.549
<i>and tucks in his arms.</i>

33:04.320 --> 33:07.791
<i>He's just the right size to mimic</i>
<i>a female.</i>

33:19.040 --> 33:21.191
<i>Goliath is deceived.</i>

33:23.960 --> 33:27.351
<i>The small male now</i>
<i>displays a white stripe,</i>

33:27.480 --> 33:28.994
<i>just like the real female</i>

33:29.320 --> 33:31.118
<i>to deter his advances.</i>

33:37.440 --> 33:39.397
<i>He slips beside her.</i>

33:42.520 --> 33:43.636
<i>And they mate.</i>

33:55.000 --> 33:57.560
<i>By mating with multiple partners,</i>

33:58.920 --> 34:02.470
<i>the female ensures</i>
<i>the greatest genetic diversity</i>

34:02.800 --> 34:03.995
<i>for her young.</i>

34:09.880 --> 34:11.792
<i>The sneaky male leaves,</i>

34:13.159 --> 34:15.231
<i>his final act complete.</i>

34:20.440 --> 34:23.797
<i>So even among giant cuttlefish,</i>
<i>it seems,</i>

34:26.320 --> 34:28.835
<i>it's not all about size.</i>

34:38.960 --> 34:42.590
<i>Other males</i>
<i>in these Australian green pastures,</i>

34:43.280 --> 34:46.591
<i>take greater responsibility</i>
<i>for their young.</i>

34:55.719 --> 34:58.110
<i>A Weedy Sea Dragon.</i>

35:04.880 --> 35:06.280
<i>This is a male</i>

35:06.560 --> 35:09.200
<i>and he's carrying a precious cargo.</i>

35:11.440 --> 35:13.193
<i>While mating with the female,</i>

35:13.440 --> 35:14.999
<i>he collected the eggs</i>

35:15.120 --> 35:17.191
<i>and attached them to his underside.</i>

35:23.560 --> 35:26.678
<i>Now, he's leaving the seaweed thickets</i>

35:29.440 --> 35:31.955
<i>and travelling into more open waters</i>

35:32.080 --> 35:34.914
<i>where elaborate camouflage</i>
<i>is less effective.</i>

35:43.560 --> 35:46.029
<i>And there are many predator out here.</i>

36:08.120 --> 36:11.796
<i>And this is what the fathers</i>
<i>risk their lives for.</i>

36:20.440 --> 36:23.274
<i>Dense clouds of minute shrimp.</i>

36:27.400 --> 36:28.754
<i>Mysids.</i>

36:30.200 --> 36:32.954
<i>One of a sea dragon's favourite foods.</i>

36:43.560 --> 36:46.200
<i>They're drawing other sea dragons</i>
<i>out here too.</i>

37:09.520 --> 37:13.275
<i>Finally, it's time for the young</i>
<i>to break free.</i>

37:14.480 --> 37:18.110
<i>But algae has grown over</i>
<i>these developing eggs.</i>

37:19.840 --> 37:21.832
<i>And it risks smothering them.</i>

37:26.720 --> 37:29.599
<i>Nonetheless, the babies are emerging.</i>

37:40.400 --> 37:42.437
<i>They've hatched successfully.</i>

37:53.760 --> 37:56.639
<i>The fathers return to the tangle of kelp</i>

37:56.960 --> 37:58.917
<i>where they're virtually invisible.</i>

38:05.240 --> 38:07.630
<i>While the young remain out here.</i>

38:11.800 --> 38:13.598
<i>But they will grow quickly,</i>

38:14.840 --> 38:17.674
<i>surrounded as they are</i>
<i>by their ideal food.</i>

38:28.240 --> 38:31.039
<i>Vast numbers of the ocean's young fish,</i>

38:31.440 --> 38:34.319
<i>start their lives in the green seas.</i>

38:40.280 --> 38:45.480
<i>One of the richest nurseries of all,</i>
<i>are the mangrove forests.</i>

38:50.480 --> 38:52.915
<i>Fringing the coastline of the Tropics,</i>

38:53.720 --> 38:57.600
<i>they form a natural protective barrier</i>
<i>between land and sea,</i>

38:59.600 --> 39:02.877
<i>and are some of the world's most</i>
<i>productive forests.</i>

39:16.080 --> 39:19.312
<i>Below the water,</i>
<i>their arching aerial roots</i>

39:19.400 --> 39:20.959
<i>give them a firm footing.</i>

39:32.360 --> 39:35.432
<i>Here there's abundant food</i>
<i>for baby fish.</i>

39:40.760 --> 39:44.197
<i>While the tangled roots protect them</i>
<i>from bigger fish,</i>

39:44.400 --> 39:47.472
<i>and other predators that haunt</i>
<i>the channels.</i>

40:18.720 --> 40:20.518
<i>But in Northern Australia</i>

40:21.680 --> 40:23.717
<i>with the receding tide,</i>

40:25.480 --> 40:29.440
<i>the little fish are forced</i>
<i>to leave their shelter.</i>

40:34.680 --> 40:36.956
<i>And now, they're vulnerable.</i>

41:22.200 --> 41:26.080
<i>It's the most deadly assassin</i>
<i>in the green seas.</i>

41:34.000 --> 41:36.276
<i>The Zebra Mantis Shrimp.</i>

41:37.200 --> 41:40.193
<i>A male, almost 40 centimetres long.</i>

41:57.680 --> 42:00.354
<i>But he's not hunting just for himself.</i>

42:06.040 --> 42:08.919
<i>He's collecting food for his mate.</i>

42:10.760 --> 42:14.356
<i>She may have been his partner</i>
<i>for 20 years.</i>

42:22.320 --> 42:25.154
<i>She relies on him to bring her food.</i>

42:27.800 --> 42:31.237
<i>And puts her energy</i>
<i>into her eggs instead.</i>

42:36.040 --> 42:38.032
<i>In a world so full of food,</i>

42:38.200 --> 42:40.510
<i>this would seem a sensible strategy.</i>

42:48.480 --> 42:50.517
<i>But it's also a risky one.</i>

43:16.200 --> 43:19.830
<i>Were her male to disappear,</i>
<i>she could starve.</i>

43:28.160 --> 43:31.119
<i>Something has caught</i>
<i>this male's attention.</i>

43:34.000 --> 43:36.390
<i>Perhaps an irresistible odour</i>

43:38.000 --> 43:39.673
<i>or a distant call.</i>

43:42.800 --> 43:46.794
<i>Whatever the reason,</i>
<i>a male will leave his burrow</i>

43:47.840 --> 43:49.832
<i>and his lifelong mate.</i>

43:58.640 --> 44:00.518
<i>An even larger hole.</i>

44:12.800 --> 44:15.076
<i>Females who have lost their mates</i>

44:15.240 --> 44:17.630
<i>appear to send out distress signals</i>

44:17.800 --> 44:20.031
<i>to call in a new male.</i>

44:25.880 --> 44:28.440
<i>A larger female will produce more eggs.</i>

44:28.720 --> 44:30.518
<i>So by mating with her,</i>

44:31.120 --> 44:33.191
<i>he will father more offspring.</i>

44:38.640 --> 44:41.872
<i>But infidelity comes at a price.</i>

44:45.560 --> 44:49.156
<i>A larger partner demands more food.</i>

45:03.760 --> 45:07.231
<i>The richer a sea,</i>
<i>the greater the competition.</i>

45:08.600 --> 45:10.751
<i>And there is one green sea</i>

45:10.960 --> 45:14.840
<i>that supports more life</i>
<i>than all the rest combined.</i>

45:17.840 --> 45:21.072
<i>Unlike the mangrove forests</i>
<i>and the sea grass prairies,</i>

45:21.280 --> 45:24.114
<i>its location is in the open seas,</i>

45:24.280 --> 45:27.273
<i>and only temporary and unpredictable.</i>

45:32.360 --> 45:35.910
<i>This greenness comes</i>
<i>not from rooted plants,</i>

45:38.800 --> 45:41.235
<i>but from clouds of floating ones.</i>

45:51.240 --> 45:54.233
<i>Billions of microscopic phytoplankton</i>

45:54.640 --> 45:56.120
<i>are proliferating.</i>

46:01.800 --> 46:03.393
<i>And in such numbers,</i>

46:03.520 --> 46:07.753
<i>that they fuel one</i>
<i>of the greatest feasts of all.</i>

46:16.600 --> 46:18.717
<i>Off America's Pacific Coast,</i>

46:19.680 --> 46:24.072

<i>So are sea lions.</i>

46:46.440 --> 46:49.672
<i>They're heading</i>
<i>for Monterey Bay, California,</i>

46:51.040 --> 46:54.590
<i>where algal blooms have caused</i>
<i>an explosion,</i>

<i>Anchovies,</i>

<i>millions of them.</i>

47:10.280 --> 47:13.273
<i>The dolphins herd the anchovies</i>
<i>towards the surface.</i>

47:16.880 --> 47:21.193
<i>Sea birds and sea lions</i>
<i>take advantage of the shoals appearance.</i>

47:26.320 --> 47:29.313
<i>It's a race to grab a share</i>

<i>They're claiming the biggest share</i>

49:01.880 --> 49:04.270
<i>So crucial are these tiny plankton,</i>

49:04.640 --> 49:08.600
<i>that almost all marine life ultimately</i>

<i>But of all the creatures</i>
<i>living in these forests,</i>

51:15.280 --> 51:18.159
<i>filming one in the waters</i>
<i>of the Cape of South Africa,</i>

51:18.320 --> 51:20.835
<i>was to prove</i>
<i>the greatest challenge of all.</i>

51:23.440 --> 51:25.272
<i>Naturalist, Craig Foster,</i>

51:25.400 --> 51:29.280
<i>has developed a fascination</i>
<i>for its most secretive resident,</i>

51:29.840 --> 51:31.354
<i>a common octopus.</i>

51:37.280 --> 51:40.956
<i>There are almost one hundred</i>
<i>species of shark in these waters.</i>

51:41.200 --> 51:43.157
<i>But that doesn't deter Craig,</i>

51:43.240 --> 51:46.278
<i>who's swum here every morning</i>
<i>for the past six years.</i>

51:54.000 --> 51:57.277
CRAIG: When you find that really
small, tiny, little, oval hole,

51:57.360 --> 51:59.636
then you know it's been killed
by an octopus.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.199
And if you look very, very carefully,
they're often in the vicinity of that.

52:14.720 --> 52:18.077
<i>Craig has witnessed the antics</i>
<i>of these octopuses,</i>

52:18.240 --> 52:20.914
<i>and wants to share</i>
<i>his remarkable discoveries</i>

52:21.000 --> 52:23.674
<i>with</i> Blue Planet <i>cameraman,</i>
<i>Roger Horrocks.</i>

52:32.160 --> 52:36.040
<i>Roger is immediately charmed</i>
<i>by the strength of their personalities.</i>

52:38.800 --> 52:41.440
It's really been astounding
to see how individual

52:41.520 --> 52:42.874
these, these characters are.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.196
The common octopus
all display different behaviours.

52:48.760 --> 52:51.673
Some were extremely timid.
Some were very, very bold.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.000
They have variety,
and it's really endeared me to them.

53:01.200 --> 53:03.999
<i>After weeks of filming</i>
<i>different individuals,</i>

53:04.080 --> 53:05.958
<i>they finally meet one octopus,</i>

53:06.040 --> 53:08.839
<i>that's not only seemingly unafraid</i>
<i>of the camera,</i>

53:09.120 --> 53:11.157
<i>but willing to perform for it.</i>

53:21.280 --> 53:22.839
ROGER: She just came right out, whoop.

53:23.120 --> 53:25.874
And it came right through underneath
the tripod into my legs.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.079
- Yeah.
- That's cool. Amazing.

53:29.080 --> 53:30.719
She very quicklyjust

53:31.240 --> 53:32.833
completely accepted both of us.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.476
So, we've actually been getting these
intimate behaviours, it's amazing.

53:41.480 --> 53:43.437
I've watched this octopus
for many months,

53:43.560 --> 53:46.758
and it's just trusting us in the water,
carrying on with normal activity

53:46.880 --> 53:48.519
which is just so fantastic.

53:56.600 --> 54:01.914
<i>Months later, the team finally</i>
<i>film their star octopus on the hunt.</i>

54:18.120 --> 54:20.555
<i>But then discover the grave consequences</i>

54:20.720 --> 54:24.077
<i>of sharing the forest with so many</i>
<i>other predators.</i>

54:24.960 --> 54:26.314
<i>Pyjama Sharks.</i>

54:27.960 --> 54:31.510
CRAIG: Pound for pound, these sharks
are far more brazen and aggressive

54:31.600 --> 54:32.750
than a Great White.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.519
They're like guided missiles.

54:34.960 --> 54:38.590
The slightest smell that octopus
gives off, that shark will find it.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.916
The Pyjama Shark actually
got hold of that octopus,

54:47.120 --> 54:49.999
and I mean, I just assumed that was it.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.397
CRAIG: After spending so much time
with this animal,

54:55.480 --> 54:57.949
it was just so difficult
watching her get attacked.

55:05.240 --> 55:08.278
<i>Then, to their amazement,</i>
<i>she fights back.</i>

55:14.160 --> 55:16.755
ROGER: She put her tentacles down,
you can see them coming through

55:16.880 --> 55:18.553
the gill, basically closed the mouth.

55:18.960 --> 55:21.953
The shark couldn't breathe.
And that's what enabled her to escape.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.796
And just witnessing
that whole thing was,

55:26.240 --> 55:28.914
you know,
it was an incredibly intense moment.

55:30.360 --> 55:33.273
<i>The team are relieved by her escape.</i>

55:46.400 --> 55:48.153
<i>But when caught out in the open,</i>

55:48.360 --> 55:51.512
<i>her next trick,</i>
<i>astonishes them even more.</i>

55:54.800 --> 55:56.439
CRAIG: It lifted its arms and legs,

55:56.560 --> 55:58.677
over its head and at the same time,

55:59.360 --> 56:03.070
pulled the shell material with it
and created this extraordinary

56:03.600 --> 56:04.716
armoury.

56:06.560 --> 56:08.074
The octopus had armoured up and then

56:08.240 --> 56:09.913
and that guy came through from the back.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.554
He could kind of smell something.

56:12.200 --> 56:13.793
CRAIG: He's not seeing an octopus head,

56:13.880 --> 56:16.395
he's seeing that strange armoury.

56:17.800 --> 56:20.190
And he was bumping the octopus.

56:20.840 --> 56:24.993
It was just incredible to see
how that octopus outwitted that shark,

56:25.080 --> 56:27.800
using the armour,
using all its knowledge.

56:27.920 --> 56:29.912
It was just absolutely phenomenal.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.871
ROGER: She's a rock star, man.
A proper little rock star.
