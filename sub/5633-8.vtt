00:00.934 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.507
Catch all-new episodes Sundays
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.509 --> 00:11.610
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.480
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.482 --> 00:15.714
Only on Fox.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.525
HOMER: D'oh!

00:33.199 --> 00:35.267
â™ª

00:37.003 --> 00:38.670
(clears throat)
Yes, uh,

00:38.672 --> 00:40.472
the students
of Springfield Elementary

00:40.474 --> 00:44.009
have each created
an alternative energy vehicle.

00:44.011 --> 00:47.146
One of which will ensure
the future of humanity

00:47.148 --> 00:49.481
as determined by a short race
across the parking lot.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.517
(mumbles):
Yeah, yeah.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.153
And now, uh, what is
your car powered by, uh,

00:54.155 --> 00:55.988
fat little boy?

00:55.990 --> 00:58.157
Hydrogen-powered fuel cells.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.992
Ah, hydrogen--
yeah, yes, wonderful.

00:59.994 --> 01:02.227
My car is powered by the wind!

01:03.563 --> 01:05.330
Oh, how it blows.

01:05.332 --> 01:07.366
Mine is potato-powered.

01:07.368 --> 01:10.736
I keep tell you
I'm not a potato.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.738
Be quiet, hash browns!

01:12.740 --> 01:14.373
Dad, I'm so excited!
I think--

01:14.375 --> 01:16.408
Hey, please don't
stand so close.

01:16.410 --> 01:20.045
In the world of solar power,
shadows are the arch-enemy.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.513
I think I might win.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.348
I believe in you
and that's a given.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.017
But I don't know.

01:25.019 --> 01:27.886
That kid's car has flames
painted on the side of it.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.955
Why would he do it
if it wasn't fast?

01:30.924 --> 01:33.592
Children, start your engines!

01:33.594 --> 01:34.927
They're not engines!

01:34.929 --> 01:36.862
That's the whole
point of this thing!

01:36.864 --> 01:38.030
Yeah... just go.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.498
(crowd cheering)

01:42.535 --> 01:45.204
That never works.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.605
Yahoo!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.707
I'm sun-made racin'!

01:48.709 --> 01:50.209
Duff Beer, the only way

01:50.211 --> 01:52.478
to get fathers
through kids' events.

01:53.379 --> 01:54.379
Huh?

01:54.381 --> 01:56.081
What? No!
That shouldn't happen!

01:56.083 --> 01:58.350
I should have stored energy!

02:00.720 --> 02:02.387
You skimped on the cadmium
in your batteries,

02:02.389 --> 02:04.423
just like a girl.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.558
Stick to the liberal
arts, honey.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.061
Uh, have fun going
to Oberlin! (laughs)

02:09.063 --> 02:11.230
Maybe you can transfer
after a couple years...

02:11.232 --> 02:13.065
to Bates! (laughing)

02:13.067 --> 02:15.234
Enjoy Maine in the winter!

02:15.236 --> 02:18.103
Hope you like
Division III basketball!

02:18.105 --> 02:20.072
(boys laughing)

02:20.074 --> 02:20.906
(crying)

02:20.908 --> 02:23.742
Now, don't you worry, kid.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.311
They also laughed
at Amelia Vanderbuckle.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.312
(sniffling)

02:27.314 --> 02:29.615
Amelia Vanderbuckle?
Who's she?

02:29.617 --> 02:32.985
Ah, she was Springfield's
original lady inventor.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.086
Ah...!

02:34.088 --> 02:35.988
Why have I never
heard of her?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.789
Well, totally nuts.

02:37.791 --> 02:38.924
She made a mess of everything.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.425
Oh!

02:40.427 --> 02:42.961
Easy, girly, don't go
Vanderbuckle on us.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.229
(grunting)

02:51.004 --> 02:52.971
"Amelia Vanderbuckle
lived in Springfield

02:52.973 --> 02:54.339
"in the 1800s.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.309
"She was the middle child
of a family of 17.

02:57.311 --> 03:00.479
"12 of whom died
from exposure to drafty windows.

03:00.481 --> 03:04.516
Her father worked as a human
canary in the poison mines."

03:05.685 --> 03:06.952
"Amelia was the first

03:06.954 --> 03:09.121
female graduate
of Springfield Tech."

03:09.123 --> 03:10.622
Do you have to
read out loud?

03:10.624 --> 03:12.958
I'm trying to pour ants
in this doll.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.127
(louder): "Among other things,
she was the proud inventor

03:15.129 --> 03:17.529
of the steam-powered
barber chair."

03:18.531 --> 03:20.599
(jaunty, tinny
piano music playing)

03:31.144 --> 03:31.977
(both scream)

03:31.979 --> 03:33.045
I want one!

03:33.047 --> 03:35.047
"A medical board
diagnosed Amelia

03:35.049 --> 03:38.984
"with acute feminine
overreachism and she was--

03:38.986 --> 03:40.652
(gasps)
"She was committed

03:40.654 --> 03:43.488
to the Springfield Home
for the Criminally Different."

03:43.490 --> 03:45.324
Whoa, the banana cabana?

03:45.326 --> 03:47.025
"But Amelia never gave up,

03:47.027 --> 03:48.560
"continuing to work
as an inventor

03:48.562 --> 03:51.163
within the confines
of the asylum."

03:51.165 --> 03:52.164
BART: <i>Ay, carumba!</i>

03:52.166 --> 03:54.166
Bart, if we find
those inventions,

03:54.168 --> 03:56.668
we can prove that Amelia
was scientifically significant.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.003
Pass.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.504
Listen to me.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.006
I need to prove
this woman was not a lunatic

04:01.008 --> 04:03.342
so people will not giggle
when they hear the words

04:03.344 --> 04:04.843
"woman scientist."

04:04.845 --> 04:07.012
(chuckles)
"Woman scientist."

04:07.014 --> 04:10.249
What's next--
boy cigarette girl?

04:10.251 --> 04:12.017
(Grampa laughs in distance)
Let me ask again.

04:12.019 --> 04:15.854
Will you help me break into
an abandoned insane asylum?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.856
(wind gusting, whistling)

04:17.858 --> 04:20.759
Abandoned asylum, where
have you been all my life?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.060
How do we get in?

04:22.062 --> 04:24.696
Well, I'd say
the best bet

04:24.698 --> 04:25.697
is the sewer pipe.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.865
Oh, gee.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.934
(echoing):
Oh, come on, Bart.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.702
Or this door.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.070
Bart!

04:32.072 --> 04:33.939
(laughs)

04:36.576 --> 04:38.243
(moaning nearby)

04:38.245 --> 04:41.880
The ghosts of a thousand
lunatics are making me hot.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.116
Yeah, what doesn't
make you hot?

04:44.118 --> 04:46.184
Alcoholic stepfathers.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.057
(goofy grunting
and snorting)

04:52.059 --> 04:53.892
Ew! Stop that!

04:53.894 --> 04:55.894
You don't know who had
that in their mouth.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.129
Sure I do--
some luno!

04:57.131 --> 04:58.964
Mmm, that's good crazy.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.132
Ew.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.900
"Vanderbean, Vanderbottom,

05:01.902 --> 05:03.568
Vanderbozo--"
ah, here we go--

05:03.570 --> 05:05.637
"Vanderbuckle!

05:05.639 --> 05:07.939
"Vanderbuckle, Alfred;
Vanderbuckle, Alice;

05:07.941 --> 05:09.741
"Vanderbuckle, Allspice;

05:09.743 --> 05:11.109
Vanderbuckle, Amelia"!

05:11.111 --> 05:13.312
A wax cylinder!

05:13.314 --> 05:15.080
Amelia recorded her voice!

05:15.082 --> 05:16.014
(nonchalant):
Mm.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.752
AMELIA:
Though I have been locked up
in this sanitarium

05:20.754 --> 05:22.621
for lo, these many years,

05:22.623 --> 05:25.957
I have completed an invention
that will change the world!

05:25.959 --> 05:26.958
Bart! Did you hear that?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.593
(imitating Dracula):
Good evening.

05:28.595 --> 05:31.463
Because I am not taken seriously
due to my gender,

05:31.465 --> 05:34.099
a friendly guard
has hidden my invention

05:34.101 --> 05:36.768
until a future time,
when some liberated young woman

05:36.770 --> 05:39.438
has the permission
of her husband to look for it.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.340
There's a whole closet
of these things!

05:41.342 --> 05:43.942
How many magicians
do they have in this place?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.111
Find my journal,
and it will lead you

05:46.113 --> 05:47.946
to my greatest invention!

05:47.948 --> 05:50.949
P.S. Nikola Tesla might have
told you he broke up with <i>me,</i>

05:50.951 --> 05:52.818
but I broke up with <i>him.</i>

05:52.820 --> 05:54.119
Aah!

05:54.121 --> 05:57.089
We've got to find that journal.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.464
Ooh!

06:05.466 --> 06:10.135
"Dear Diary, today I watched
a neighbor's house burn down.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.537
This will teach their dog
to laugh at me."

06:12.539 --> 06:16.441
Whoa! Look at me!
I'm enjoying reading!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.177
Guys, did you
ever read something

06:19.179 --> 06:21.313
and think it was written
just for you?

06:21.315 --> 06:24.583
Behold...
the diary of Nathan Little!

06:27.320 --> 06:29.888
"I pushed a vagabond
under a trolley."

06:29.890 --> 06:31.690
What's a trolley?

06:31.692 --> 06:32.824
Old-timey subway.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.893
What's a vagabond?
Homeless guy.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.195
(sobbing, wailing)

06:37.197 --> 06:39.398
What's a homeless guy?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.836
Ralphie! Come on,
we got daddy-son tap class!

06:44.838 --> 06:46.338
Tap class!

06:46.340 --> 06:49.174
Hey, where is that kid?
We got a recital next week

06:49.176 --> 06:51.243
and his timestep is terrible,
let alone flair.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.044
Tap class!

06:53.046 --> 06:54.913
Tuh... tap class?

06:54.915 --> 06:55.914
(boys scream)

06:55.916 --> 06:58.016
Ralphie, what is
going on here?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.719
Bart made us read pages
from a scary diary.

07:00.721 --> 07:04.089
I was so a-scared, sour juice
came out my front tail.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.360
Bart wrote this?
This is <i>bad.</i>

07:08.362 --> 07:10.028
Ooh, <i>really</i> bad.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.764
I don't think we're
gonna make it to...

07:12.766 --> 07:14.766
tap class.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.834
(knocking on door)

07:16.869 --> 07:18.737
Chief Wiggum?
Your son is dead...

07:18.739 --> 07:20.038
(loud gasp)

07:20.040 --> 07:21.039
...inside.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.041
(quieter gasp)

07:23.043 --> 07:24.709
That's bad, too.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.112
Yeah, these are pages
from your son's diary.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.748
I'm afraid they very
clearly show him to be...

07:29.750 --> 07:31.550
a sociopath.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.286
Hm. Well, I've never seen Bart
write in cursive,

07:34.288 --> 07:36.388
so I'm a little proud of that,

07:36.390 --> 07:38.123
but this is the worst thing

07:38.125 --> 07:40.559
that's ever happened
to this family.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.093
I-I'm sorry, Marge.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.929
And... shuffle off,

07:43.931 --> 07:45.063
shuffle off,

07:45.065 --> 07:46.131
shuffle off.

07:51.604 --> 07:52.904
(Homer humming cheerfully)

07:52.906 --> 07:55.240
Homie, I've learned
something terrible about Bart.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.410
You may want
to have a drink.
Way ahead of ya.

07:58.412 --> 08:01.913
Chief Wiggum found these pages
from our son's diary!

08:01.915 --> 08:04.583
Oh, I've had a long day.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.918
Bart might be
a sociopath.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.253
Socio-what?

08:08.255 --> 08:11.423
(groans) "Someone who
can't feel empathy or guilt.

08:11.425 --> 08:14.826
They do terrible things
and don't care who it hurts."

08:14.828 --> 08:16.094
(doorbell chiming
repeatedly)

08:16.096 --> 08:17.162
Don't answer that!

08:17.164 --> 08:18.763
It could be Bart!

08:18.765 --> 08:21.600
Bart has a key.
What?! Who gave him a key!

08:21.602 --> 08:22.601
Hey, Mrs. Simpson.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.102
Can Bart come over

08:24.104 --> 08:26.104
and see
my grandfather's collection

08:26.106 --> 08:28.340
of Japanese swords
and throwing daggers?

08:28.342 --> 08:32.110
Aah! Why don't you play
with Lisa instead, hmm?

08:32.112 --> 08:33.111
(grunts)

08:33.113 --> 08:35.480
<i>Konnichi-whaaa...?!</i>

08:35.482 --> 08:36.648
Hey, Milhouse.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.617
Wow, <i>this</i> is
a surprise.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.620
I'm usually sweating when
we talk, but not this time.

08:41.622 --> 08:45.156
It's amazing how you
can charm <i>and</i> disgust me
at the same time.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.958
That's just what happens

08:46.960 --> 08:49.294
when I'm with the
prettiest girl in town.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.495
Aw...

08:50.497 --> 08:51.963
(cackles, snorts)

08:51.965 --> 08:53.131
Ew.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.000
Amelia's journal tells us

08:55.002 --> 08:56.968
that her invention
is buried in the basement

08:56.970 --> 08:59.004
of the Springfield
Suffragette Society.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.972
(sighs): Ah...
anyone ever tell you

09:00.974 --> 09:02.874
you're beautiful when
you're sleuthing?

09:02.876 --> 09:06.311
Milhouse, did the Hardy Boys
ever hit on Nancy Drew?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.879
Frank did, but Joe...

09:07.881 --> 09:10.982
let's just say there's
a mystery about <i>him.</i>

09:10.984 --> 09:14.085
The Suffragette Society
was right here.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.058
Oh... here?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.494
Hey, sweetie, you
looking for your mom?

09:22.496 --> 09:25.163
I'll find her-- just, uh,
give me her cup size.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.865
Actually, we're here
because your basement

09:26.867 --> 09:29.067
is home to a landmark
of feminist history.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.036
Do you mind
if we poke around?

09:31.038 --> 09:32.571
The basement, eh?
Yeah, that's where

09:32.573 --> 09:35.407
we wash the ketchup off
the old onion rings.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.076
So no.
These guys want
a children's menu?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.578
Nah, they're just leavin'.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.013
Seriously, kids, I got
to switch ten TV's

09:42.015 --> 09:45.684
over to the fourth round of
the NBA draft, so get lost.

09:45.686 --> 09:49.421
All right, Denver Nuggets
on the clock, people!

09:50.356 --> 09:51.856
Okay, I found
a test online

09:51.858 --> 09:53.692
that will tell us,
once and for all,

09:53.694 --> 09:55.560
whether Bart is a...
you know.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.695
HOMER:
Wait a minute!

09:56.697 --> 09:58.063
We can't just give Bart

09:58.065 --> 09:59.731
something labeled
"Sociopath Test"!

09:59.733 --> 10:02.701
He might look it up and set
us on fire with his mind!

10:02.703 --> 10:04.202
You're right!
We need Bart to think

10:04.204 --> 10:06.037
the test is
for something else.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.440
Finally! A use for
the label maker!

10:10.776 --> 10:14.212
One of you betrayed me, and
snitches lose their stitches.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.081
(high-pitched):
Sit on my banana!

10:16.083 --> 10:17.549
(normal voice):
Why, you little...!

10:17.551 --> 10:18.950
(grunting)

10:18.952 --> 10:20.919
Where does he get this stuff?

10:20.921 --> 10:23.888
Hey, son, your mom and I
just found this quiz

10:23.890 --> 10:25.557
you'd really love to take.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.058
"Are You a Jet Ski Dude

10:27.060 --> 10:28.927
or a Motocross Maestro?"

10:28.929 --> 10:30.762
Remember to answer the
questions honestly.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.398
We want to know if you meet
the clinical definition

10:33.400 --> 10:35.667
of "jet ski dude."

10:38.971 --> 10:41.573
"I enjoy manipulating
other people."

10:41.575 --> 10:43.408
"I believe I'm being followed."

10:43.410 --> 10:47.078
"Sometimes I feel as if I must
injure myself or someone else."

10:47.080 --> 10:48.146
Agree, agree, agree.

10:49.081 --> 10:50.582
Hmm.

10:50.584 --> 10:51.650
"Sociopath."

10:51.652 --> 10:52.851
What's that?

10:55.454 --> 10:56.955
<i>Ay, carumba!</i>

10:56.957 --> 10:58.957
That's what they think I am?

10:58.959 --> 11:02.594
Fine! I'll pretend to be the
biggest sociopath in the world!

11:02.596 --> 11:05.263
And I only need to change
three answers.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.765
Is he nuts?
I don't know.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.767
What do you think?
I mean, he looks nuts,

11:08.769 --> 11:10.602
that's for sure.
(clears throat)

11:10.604 --> 11:12.604
So, here's your test.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.806
Call me crazy,
but I enjoyed it.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.508
(Bart whistling
"Pop Goes the Weasel")

11:18.778 --> 11:21.780
Well, the good news
is that Bart just got

11:21.782 --> 11:24.015
his first 100%
ever on a test.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.518
Oh, my God.
What do we do?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.119
Whatever Bart wants.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.788
(snickers)

11:29.790 --> 11:31.656
â™ª Crazy

11:31.658 --> 11:34.192
â™ª But that's how it goes

11:36.662 --> 11:38.997
â™ª Millions of people

11:38.999 --> 11:42.100
â™ª Living as foes

11:43.669 --> 11:45.970
â™ª Maybe

11:45.972 --> 11:47.972
â™ª It's not too late

11:47.974 --> 11:49.040
(tires screeching)

11:50.476 --> 11:53.478
â™ª To learn how to love

11:53.480 --> 11:55.880
â™ª And forget how to hate

11:57.983 --> 12:00.985
â™ª Mental wounds not healing

12:00.987 --> 12:04.222
â™ª Life's a bitter shame

12:04.224 --> 12:07.058
â™ª I'm going off the rails

12:07.060 --> 12:09.127
â™ª On a crazy train

12:11.530 --> 12:16.134
â™ª I'm going off the rails
on a crazy train! â™ª

12:25.377 --> 12:27.712
Thanks.
(male voice, Scottish accent):
My pleasure.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.748
Anything to take down
Knockers.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.083
I've always hated them,
because they wouldn't open up

12:32.085 --> 12:36.020
at 4:00 a.m. to show the World
Caber Tossing Championships.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.523
Okay, Willie, you can
only use the jackhammer

12:38.525 --> 12:40.692
when there's lots
of noise upstairs.

12:40.694 --> 12:41.926
No worries.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.028
It   <i>i</i>Monday Night
Football,

12:44.030 --> 12:46.064
by which I mean
American football,

12:46.066 --> 12:48.266
by which I mean
no football at all!

12:48.268 --> 12:50.201
(muffled cheering and applause)
(jackhammering)

12:50.203 --> 12:52.370
(gasps)
There's the box!

12:52.372 --> 12:53.505
(muffled cheering and applause)

12:54.907 --> 12:57.876
Ow! Medium spicy!

12:57.878 --> 13:00.044
Ach! We've hit
the hot sauce supply line!

13:00.046 --> 13:04.783
I'll have to neutralize it
with some signature blue cheese!

13:04.785 --> 13:07.185
Ah...!

13:08.721 --> 13:11.556
Look at me! I'm a sociopath!

13:11.558 --> 13:13.591
Marge, it's time
we did something.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.227
We can take him swimming.
That makes him sleepy.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.797
Not good enough.
We have to call the number

13:18.799 --> 13:20.465
at the bottom
of the test.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.267
What number?

13:22.269 --> 13:24.102
HOMER: Right there.
MARGE: "New Beginnings"?

13:24.104 --> 13:27.105
We're gonna trust our son
to an 800 number?

13:27.107 --> 13:29.107
It's 888.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.109
Marge, this is
for his own good.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.911
He failed an online test.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.647
How much more
proof do you need?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.482
Cue-abunga!

13:37.484 --> 13:39.150
(bird squawks, Bart laughs)

13:41.086 --> 13:42.987
Surprise!
Surprise!

13:42.989 --> 13:44.989
Whoa, cool! But wait a minute,

13:44.991 --> 13:46.991
my birthday's not
for another two months.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.794
We know! But we wanted
to have your party now!

13:49.796 --> 13:53.097
They were having a
sale on piÃ±atas and...

13:53.099 --> 13:56.301
one thing led to another
so we, you know,

13:56.303 --> 13:58.102
had a thing,
mumble, mumble, mumble...

13:58.104 --> 13:59.170
mumble...

13:59.172 --> 14:00.471
Well, where are my friends?

14:00.473 --> 14:02.473
Well, I was gonna
mail out invites,

14:02.475 --> 14:06.010
but I was out of stamps and
the post office line was long,

14:06.012 --> 14:08.947
(mumbling): and I didn't
know where all the little...

14:08.949 --> 14:10.448
Well, more cake for me.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.817
No, no, no, no.
Do the Moon Bounce first.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.619
Yes! The Moon Bounce!

14:14.621 --> 14:17.989
Don't want you throwing up
this delicious cake.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.057
(clunking)

14:20.793 --> 14:23.862
(grunting, laughing)

14:27.166 --> 14:28.833
(laughing)

14:28.835 --> 14:30.134
Huh.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.135
Eh.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.805
(laughing)

14:33.807 --> 14:36.140
(engine revs, tires squeal)
BART: Whoa!

14:36.142 --> 14:39.077
(Bart laughing)

14:44.984 --> 14:47.151
Wait a minute.
What is this?

14:47.153 --> 14:48.353
Is it an asylum?

14:48.355 --> 14:50.154
No, it's a pizza parlor.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.357
Please tell me, Dad,
is it really a pizza parlor?

14:52.359 --> 14:55.360
No, son-- the pizza parlor
is where your mom and I

14:55.362 --> 14:58.062
are going afterwards.
Now, you're gonna be fine.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.565
I wouldn't be surprised if you
were the least messed-up kid

15:00.567 --> 15:02.567
in the whole joint.
We love you!

15:02.569 --> 15:04.569
(doors squeak and clang)

15:04.571 --> 15:07.171
Wait, wait, wait! I didn't
even get to say good-bye.

15:07.173 --> 15:10.575
Good-bye!
I'll <i>never</i> forgive you!

15:10.577 --> 15:11.442
There. You happy?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.350
Let me out!
I was just playing a joke!

15:19.352 --> 15:22.687
A cruel joke on the people that
love me! That I don't regret!

15:22.689 --> 15:24.022
That doesn't make me
a sociopath!

15:24.024 --> 15:26.024
(door creaks open)
WOMAN: Children,

15:26.026 --> 15:28.359
form a line
in order of medication

15:28.361 --> 15:30.595
from Adderall to Zoloft.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.234
You have been brought here
for a purpose.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.235
You are fearless,

15:37.237 --> 15:38.770
and no one can stop you.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.571
Which means you'll be
of great use...

15:40.573 --> 15:42.941
To the U.S. military.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.877
I expected more
of a reaction.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.912
I waited outside
the door and everything.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.615
They don't react.
That's what we want.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.250
Right.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.053
We'll be using you
in the ultimate video game

15:55.055 --> 15:58.456
to test these U.S. Air Force
drone simulators.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.059
Man, that is
a tough crowd.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.460
HOMER: Oh!

16:03.896 --> 16:06.898
Mom, Dad, I've discovered
the most amazing thing!

16:06.900 --> 16:09.133
I can't wait...
Um, where's Bart?

16:09.135 --> 16:12.070
He's safe.
And more importantly,
we're safe.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.404
(sobs)

16:13.406 --> 16:15.907
I miss him so much.

16:15.909 --> 16:17.909
(panting)

16:17.911 --> 16:20.078
Oh. Can I call him?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.080
You can call his guard, Tico.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.314
He picks up sometimes.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.749
I see.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.651
Okay, I'll do that.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.453
Homie, where
did we go wrong?

16:28.455 --> 16:30.955
I don't know, sweetie.
I don't know.

16:30.957 --> 16:35.093
We did everything we could for
him during the commercials.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.961
And we're live

16:36.963 --> 16:38.096
as Lisa Simpson prepares
to prove

16:38.098 --> 16:39.831
that Springfield embarrassment

16:39.833 --> 16:41.833
Amelia Vanderbuckle
deserves to be

16:41.835 --> 16:43.935
in the female scientific
pantheon,

16:43.937 --> 16:46.004
along with Marie Curie and, uh,

16:46.006 --> 16:48.006
you know, uh, um,

16:48.008 --> 16:50.775
Velma from <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

16:50.777 --> 16:52.510
Thank you all for coming out

16:52.512 --> 16:56.447
to support a woman's place
in history!

16:56.449 --> 16:59.450
That's what this is?
I thought it was a
Green Bay Packers rally.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.953
All right, you know what,
this ain't coming off.

17:01.955 --> 17:06.057
Behold, the masterpiece
of Amelia Vanderbuckle.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.126
(crowd murmurs)

17:08.128 --> 17:09.293
A loom?!

17:09.295 --> 17:10.294
That isn't science.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.130
That's home economics.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.132
Everyone, storm the stage!

17:14.134 --> 17:16.034
(crowd clamoring)
Not so fast!

17:16.036 --> 17:17.802
This is no ordinary loom!

17:17.804 --> 17:19.504
Even an extraordinary loom

17:19.506 --> 17:21.973
is the most boring thing
I could think of.

17:21.975 --> 17:25.810
This is much, much more
than just a loom.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.145
(clacking)

17:27.147 --> 17:29.013
(squeaking, clicking;
Lisa grunts)

17:29.015 --> 17:31.416
(whirring, clanking)

17:35.654 --> 17:37.789
(puffing)

17:40.192 --> 17:41.692
(crowd gasping in wonder)

17:41.694 --> 17:43.895
It's alive!
And polite!

17:43.897 --> 17:49.067
"Operand"? Looks like it wants
us to give it a math problem.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.240
(grunting)

17:56.242 --> 17:57.341
(whirring, thudding)

17:57.343 --> 17:59.744
Oh, my God. Oh, God!

17:59.746 --> 18:02.180
It's the first
computational device!

18:02.182 --> 18:03.915
People, people,
don't you see?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.683
The board acts
like punch cards

18:05.685 --> 18:07.552
and the loom
like a computer,

18:07.554 --> 18:11.089
with the Charles Babbage
and the John von Neumann...

18:11.091 --> 18:14.425
Let's have the square root
of nine cheers for Lisa!

18:15.894 --> 18:17.428
(whirring, clanking)

18:17.430 --> 18:21.099
ALL: Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

18:22.234 --> 18:25.036
You see that, Bart?
You see what your sister did?

18:25.038 --> 18:26.037
Yeah, yeah, great.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.039
Listen, I'm in a simulator,

18:28.041 --> 18:29.540
so I can't really talk.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.409
And you know I'm a sociopath,

18:31.411 --> 18:33.077
so I'm just going through
the motions here.

18:33.079 --> 18:34.278
I love you.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.880
I was just saying that
to myself.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.548
(beep)

18:37.550 --> 18:40.084
Kaboom! Blam-blam-blam!

18:40.086 --> 18:41.119
Have a smart bomb, stupid.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.220
(imitates explosions)

18:42.222 --> 18:44.088
Nice <i>not</i> knowin' ya.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.289
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
All targets destroyed.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.024
Simulation complete.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.962
You are impressive.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.231
Even though I'm the only
real person in the world,

18:53.233 --> 18:55.733
and, therefore, I created you
in my imagination.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.469
Children, your empty souls
and flying fingers

18:58.471 --> 19:01.239
are very impressive,
and I can tell you now

19:01.241 --> 19:03.908
that was no simulation.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.611
You mean
we were blowing up real stuff?

19:06.613 --> 19:09.413
That's right-- convoys,
terrorist training camps,

19:09.415 --> 19:12.150
suspicious weddings,
Kabul Starbucks.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.985
Cool!
Awesome.
I knew it!

19:13.987 --> 19:16.087
(voice breaking): No, I thought
it was a video game.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.122
I don't want
to hurt real people.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.424
Oh, I want to go home.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.993
Please?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.261
How disappointing.

19:23.263 --> 19:26.464
Does anyone else share
the human boy's feelings?

19:26.466 --> 19:29.467
Son, the truth is
the simulators we told you

19:29.469 --> 19:32.937

19:32.939 --> 19:33.771
(all gasping)

19:33.773 --> 19:35.106
Now, I'm sorry, Bart,

19:35.108 --> 19:37.341
but you are a healthy,
normal boy.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.943
We're sending you home.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.779
Really? Oh, wow.
Dudes, it's been real.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.514
Although, actually,
it was all a fake.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.783
I'll never forget you,
Bart Simpson.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.785
742 Evergreen Terrace.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.987
Dog door in the back
that has no lock.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.055
(knocking on door)

19:52.958 --> 19:55.359
My little guy is back!

19:55.361 --> 19:58.963
And I'm not bad!
I just made bad decisions.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.698
(crying):
It's okay, boy.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.801
You started out life
as a bad decision.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.971
The best bad decision
I ever made.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.140
(all crying)

20:09.142 --> 20:12.143
(crying): And I restored
the reputation

20:12.145 --> 20:15.046
of a scientist
from 100 years ago.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.685
(crying): And Maggie tried
strawberries for the first time.

20:20.687 --> 20:24.355
What a day!
What a day!

20:24.357 --> 20:25.723
(sucking pacifier)

20:31.230 --> 20:33.164
Okay, Lisa, go
ahead and say it.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.665
Don't be ashamed.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.234
I'm immortal!

20:36.236 --> 20:38.502
(echoing): ...immortal!

20:38.504 --> 20:41.505
Hey, Madam Docent,
want to come see?

20:41.507 --> 20:44.008
DOCENT: Oh, I'd love to, but
there's a huge crowd here

20:44.010 --> 20:45.843
at the Science
of Thor exhibit.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.747
Hey, tour! Want to see a great
invention and its plaque?

20:49.749 --> 20:51.749
We're just passing through
to the cafe.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.984
Double-time, tour.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.053
How 'bout you, sir?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.722
Je ne parle pas l'Anglais.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.724
<i>Pas de problÃ¨me.</i>
<i>Je parle franÃ§ais!</i>

20:59.726 --> 21:02.493
Uh, leave me alone,
little girl!

21:07.933 --> 21:13.137
Okay, pal, if you are
indeed a personal computer...

21:17.042 --> 21:18.776
Oh, baby. Spin that yarn.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.045
Now, that is a loom with a view.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.881
MARGE: Homie! Come help
me carry the groceries!

21:23.883 --> 21:25.116
(shouts)
Yeah!

21:25.118 --> 21:27.118
Clear history, clear history.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.987
Just working
on your anniversary present.

21:30.722 --> 21:32.223
I know this looks like nothing,

21:32.225 --> 21:34.592
but it's actually bad.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.694
â™ª

21:48.106 --> 21:50.174
Shh!

21:57.582 --> 21:59.450
You've just watched
The Simpsons.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.253
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:04.089 --> 22:07.191
(crowd cheering)

22:08.093 --> 22:10.261
MAN:
This is American Idol!

22:10.263 --> 22:13.197
(cheering continues)

22:15.133 --> 22:16.701
Absolutely fantastic.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.341
It's really about
dreams coming true.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.743
-(screaming)
-â™ª I'm going to
Hollywood â™ª

22:26.712 --> 22:29.313
MAN: Discover an idol
one last time.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.783
â™ª (chorus vocalizing)
