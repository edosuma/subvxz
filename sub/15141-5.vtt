00:00.000 --> 00:01.668
NARRATOR:
 Previously, on East Los High.

00:01.735 --> 00:03.337
Are we gonna hook up later?

00:03.403 --> 00:05.572
Yeah. After party
at your place.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.641
Your new boyfriend's
gonna love it.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.576
Uh, Nic and I
are just friends.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.479
And you have fun with Nic.
Just not too much fun.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.248
So you gonna
wear that crown the whole day?

00:14.314 --> 00:17.151
Later, it'll be the only thing
I'm wearing.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.653
These are the last hours
that you're gonna be a virgin.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.022
GINA:
 I just don't think I'm ready.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.658
FILIBERTA:
 Diego's a good guy.
Just tell him how you feel.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.226
Saw you in the restroom
with Tiffany.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.594
She followed me in.
Chick's a slut.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.029
Boo!

00:29.096 --> 00:30.631
Jacob gonna be there?
Want me to call

00:30.697 --> 00:32.399
when I see him?

00:32.466 --> 00:35.235
( dramatic theme playing )

00:40.340 --> 00:41.675
Pedro, wait.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.510
Will you slow down?

00:43.577 --> 00:46.046
Why are you so mad?
It's not even 10 yet.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.682
I just blew off my boss'
birthday for nothing, Ceci.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.150
What? Why?

00:50.217 --> 00:51.785
I came back
to be with you

00:52.052 --> 00:54.488
and I see you shaking
your ass for that stupid puto.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.391
I was just dancing
with my girls.

00:57.457 --> 01:00.160
Oh, so Jacob's
one of your girls now?

01:00.227 --> 01:03.297
It's a dance.
People go to a dance to dance.

01:03.363 --> 01:06.400
Then go dance.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.602
Where the hell
are you going?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.537
How am I supposed
to get home?

01:10.604 --> 01:12.639
PEDRO:
Bitches take the bus.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.107
( scoffs )

01:14.174 --> 01:16.443
( hip hop music blaring )

01:28.121 --> 01:30.357
All right, all right.
It's about that time

01:30.424 --> 01:33.327
to find out who gets laid
or who gets played.

01:33.393 --> 01:36.063
( woman singing in Spanish )

01:44.771 --> 01:46.640
( techno music playing )

01:46.707 --> 01:49.243
( cell phone vibrates
and chimes )

01:54.514 --> 01:56.650
Congratulations
on your win.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.086
Thank you.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.154
A dinner-for-two
gift certificate.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.723
Hey, that's not bad.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.291
Let me know if you need
a dinner date.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.726
( laughs )

02:05.792 --> 02:07.794
So are you staying
for the LOL comedy show?

02:08.061 --> 02:09.229
I mean, it's about to start.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.531
Um...

02:13.500 --> 02:16.336
sure, why not?

02:16.403 --> 02:17.738
Join me?

02:18.005 --> 02:20.374
Okay. Thanks.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.751
So, what time's curfew,
Cinderella?

02:31.018 --> 02:33.053
My mom's not
a clock-watcher.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.388
I like your mom.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.089
And we know
she likes you too.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
( laughs )
( cell phone chimes )

02:41.795 --> 02:43.463
Okay, I'm free.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.165
Really? Where to?

02:49.036 --> 02:50.270
Ooh!
Oh, my--

02:50.337 --> 02:51.672
( laughs )

02:55.309 --> 02:57.778
She's got a boyfriend.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.013
I know.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.683
Well, then stop staring at her
like you don't know.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.751
I think she's drunk.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.487
Maybe she's just
building up courage.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.356
For what?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.358
Mind your business,
 chismoso.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.596
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?

03:16.663 --> 03:18.065
Men's restroom.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.466
Let's go dance.
Come on.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.134
You know what? No.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.470
I know where those hands
have been.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.671
( scoffs )

03:24.738 --> 03:27.507
( hip hop theme playing )

03:32.612 --> 03:35.048
What?

03:35.115 --> 03:37.084
( sighs )

03:37.150 --> 03:39.553
Man, I feel like
I'm in a music video.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.321
Hey, do I look like J. Lo?

03:41.388 --> 03:43.590
No disrespect, but J. Lo
ain't got nothing on you.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.791
( laughs )
Aww.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.560
( cell phone vibrates )

03:48.228 --> 03:50.564
Damn, I gotta take this.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.299
REMY ( over phone ): Yo, Nic.
Hey, man.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.134
I just finished my set.
You should have seen me.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.736
I killed it. Whoo!
 Maybe next time, dawg.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.738
Listen, I need you
to run an errand for me.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.206
I need you to pick up
some tracks

03:59.272 --> 04:00.640
and take them over
to Toxic's spot.

04:00.707 --> 04:02.042
Cool.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.777
All right
if I bring my date?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.479
Yeah, that's fine. Holla.

04:05.545 --> 04:08.014
Hey, I gotta go pick up
some tracks for my boss,

04:08.081 --> 04:09.383
but I'll be quick,
I swear.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.451
Psh. What's in it for me?

04:13.086 --> 04:15.155
Wanna ride this bad boy?

04:16.723 --> 04:18.558
Maybe later.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.394
Now, give me those keys.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.062
Oh, you think you can
handle a V-8?

04:22.129 --> 04:24.064
( engine starts )
( speaks in Spanish )

04:24.131 --> 04:25.665
This Mustang ain't nothing.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.234
I stole a BMW last week.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.702
All right.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.203
Well, let's ride.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.038
( tires screech )

( cheers and applause )

05:20.420 --> 05:22.022
( speaks in Spanish )

05:22.088 --> 05:25.225
Because we have a very,
very special treat for you.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.060
She's one of our favorites.

05:27.127 --> 05:30.130
So I want you to give a big
 aplausos, warm love

05:30.197 --> 05:32.666
to our one and only
Coco Menendez!

05:32.732 --> 05:35.635
( cheers and applause )

05:35.702 --> 05:38.238
( speaking in Spanish )

05:38.305 --> 05:40.040
Oh, my God!

05:40.106 --> 05:41.441
I just came
from the psychic,

05:41.508 --> 05:43.677
and she told me,
"Go to East L.A.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.246
Those women will eat
anything."

05:46.313 --> 05:47.647
( speaks in Spanish )

05:47.714 --> 05:50.383
I love blondes.
Oh, look how cute she is.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.152
But that nose ring
might hurt. Ouch.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.453
( both laugh )
 Dios mío.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.689
My parents cannot
handle the fact

05:55.755 --> 05:57.657
that I am gay.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.593
So every time I go over
for dinner,

05:59.659 --> 06:02.362
they serve a plate
of sausage.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.130
( both laughing )

06:04.197 --> 06:06.666
I don't eat meat!

06:10.504 --> 06:12.172
Remy.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.673
Hey, brother.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.109
What's up, man?
Sorry for the interruption,

06:16.176 --> 06:18.178
but your boy's in high demand
around here.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.248
That's cool. It just means he's
gotta make it up to me later.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.351
Ooh, stepping up, boy.
I like this one.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.552
Yeah, I like her too.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.654
Remy, Camila.
Camila, Remy.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.656
Hey.
Hey.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.591
So this is your place?

06:31.658 --> 06:34.094
Yeah. Impressed?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.162
Looks cool.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.331
Don't just stand there.
NICOLAS: Oh, yeah.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.200
Show her around.
I'm gonna finish up the tracks.

06:40.267 --> 06:43.036
Yeah.
Okay.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.404
REMY:
Nice to meet you, Camila.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.273
Same here.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.575
This is where
the magic happens.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.279
Yo.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.347
Yeah, kid's on his way
right now.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.026
( engine starting )

07:07.039 --> 07:09.108
Don't die on me now.

07:09.175 --> 07:10.977
Don't worry.
I got this.

07:11.043 --> 07:12.245
Have you guys seen Zac?

07:12.311 --> 07:14.046
He took off.

07:14.113 --> 07:16.215
Can you give us a ride?
Diego's car just died.

07:16.282 --> 07:17.984
It's fine. We're good.

07:18.050 --> 07:20.453
Can you give us a ride
to my place?

07:20.520 --> 07:22.321
( engine sputtering )

07:23.322 --> 07:25.658
Hey.

07:25.725 --> 07:27.393
( groans )

07:27.460 --> 07:29.729
Maybe I should call
my dad.

07:29.996 --> 07:31.364
I can't just
leave my truck like this.

07:31.430 --> 07:34.367
No. I had everything
planned.

07:34.433 --> 07:36.202
What, don't you wanna?

07:36.269 --> 07:38.671
You know I do.

07:40.573 --> 07:42.608
( car approaching )

07:42.675 --> 07:45.044
( car horn honks )

07:45.111 --> 07:47.146
Are you two coming
or what?

07:47.213 --> 07:49.582
( hip hop music blaring )

07:51.083 --> 07:54.520
Check you out.

07:54.587 --> 07:56.622
I can't believe you actually
get paid to work here.

07:56.689 --> 07:59.258
Not yet.
I'm still an intern.

07:59.325 --> 08:01.360
Intern? Psh.

08:01.427 --> 08:04.230
Internships are for
white people.

08:04.297 --> 08:06.299
You'd have to pay me
to work for free.

08:06.365 --> 08:08.334
Yeah, but Remy's cool.

08:08.401 --> 08:10.269
And rich.

08:10.336 --> 08:12.338
He should be paying you.

08:12.405 --> 08:14.273
He said he'll listen
to my music,

08:14.340 --> 08:16.509
and if he likes it,

08:16.576 --> 08:19.245
I'll be making bank
in no time.

08:20.513 --> 08:22.214
( hip hop music blaring )

08:22.281 --> 08:25.217
What you think?

08:25.284 --> 08:27.587
You mix this?
Yup.

08:29.121 --> 08:30.323
I guess I could
dance to it.

08:30.389 --> 08:31.991
Oh! Oh, you guess?

08:32.058 --> 08:33.492
( laughs )
All right.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.294
I like that.

08:35.361 --> 08:37.129
I like a challenge.

08:37.196 --> 08:39.966
That's why
I played it for you.

08:40.032 --> 08:42.034
For me? Why?

08:42.101 --> 08:45.304
Because I like you.

08:45.371 --> 08:47.373
I care about
what you think.

08:51.477 --> 08:53.479
( audience cheers )
( speaks indistinctly )

08:56.148 --> 08:58.017
WOMAN:
Whoo!

08:58.084 --> 08:59.619
( laughing )
So you having fun?

08:59.685 --> 09:01.988
Yeah.

09:02.054 --> 09:05.358
But that's a lot
of lesbian jokes.

09:05.424 --> 09:08.027
That's how they roll
on LOL night.

09:08.094 --> 09:10.129
"Lesbians Out Loud."

09:11.430 --> 09:13.499
Oh.
You didn't know?

09:13.566 --> 09:14.967
No idea.

09:16.636 --> 09:19.238
So you-- Do you wanna
go out sometime?

09:19.305 --> 09:21.641
Like on a date?

09:21.707 --> 09:24.176
What, you got a girlfriend?

09:24.243 --> 09:26.479
Well...

09:29.649 --> 09:31.717
Hold on a second.

09:33.085 --> 09:34.654
Are you out?

09:39.191 --> 09:41.694
Oh, the show's
about to start.

09:41.961 --> 09:44.196
( soft theme playing )

09:46.699 --> 09:48.434
( tires screech )

09:48.501 --> 09:51.537
Not here, baby.
Hey, Tiffany doesn't care.

09:53.539 --> 09:55.174
( engine revs )
( tires squeal )

09:56.375 --> 09:57.510
( coughs )

09:57.576 --> 09:59.345
Watch it.
I'm gonna barf.

09:59.412 --> 10:01.681
Yo, slow down.
( groans )

10:01.947 --> 10:03.449
Gina's had a little
too much to drink.

10:03.516 --> 10:05.284
Is this better?

10:05.351 --> 10:07.053
( engine revs )

10:08.220 --> 10:09.422
( coughs )

10:09.488 --> 10:11.624
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna throw up.

10:13.159 --> 10:14.560
( spits )

10:14.627 --> 10:17.163
Sorry.

10:21.967 --> 10:23.202
What's the rush?

10:23.269 --> 10:24.970
I gotta go.
I gotta catch the bus.

10:25.037 --> 10:26.305
At this hour?
It's not a big deal.

10:26.372 --> 10:28.074
I do it all the time.
I can take you.

10:28.140 --> 10:29.275
Oh, that's a good idea.

10:29.341 --> 10:30.710
No. You can't.

10:30.976 --> 10:32.344
I mean,
it's out of your way.

10:32.411 --> 10:34.680
Okay, okay. Go.
We got this.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.984
( car door closing )

10:40.219 --> 10:41.487
GINA:
Ow.

10:41.554 --> 10:44.490
( Gina speaking indistinctly )

10:46.692 --> 10:48.194
Let's call it
a night.

10:48.260 --> 10:50.596
No, no, no!
We were supposed to do it.

10:50.663 --> 10:52.431
Then why'd you drink
so much?

10:52.498 --> 10:54.133
Because I--
I was just nervous.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.502
I'm-- I'm--
I'm fine now.

11:00.106 --> 11:02.074
( groans )

11:02.141 --> 11:04.477
( coughs )

11:04.543 --> 11:06.378
I'll call you tomorrow.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.523
Where to, D-man?

11:17.590 --> 11:19.458
Shut up and drive.

11:22.194 --> 11:24.196
( ominous theme playing )

11:26.132 --> 11:28.033
( dog barking in distance )

11:36.575 --> 11:37.977
( sighs )

11:38.043 --> 11:40.045
( car approaching )

11:51.724 --> 11:54.193
You want a ride...

11:54.260 --> 11:55.561
on my face?

11:55.628 --> 11:57.263
Suck my ass!

11:57.329 --> 11:59.098
That's what I'm talking about.
Oh, hell, no.

11:59.165 --> 12:00.599
Oh.
Get out of here!

12:00.666 --> 12:02.301
Stupid!

12:03.202 --> 12:05.304
( shouts in Spanish )

12:06.705 --> 12:08.574
Shit!

12:10.643 --> 12:12.645
( hip hop music playing )

12:16.482 --> 12:20.286
So, um, how do you mix this?

12:20.352 --> 12:22.421
Oh, so how do I mix this?

12:22.488 --> 12:26.058
Well, if I just...

12:26.125 --> 12:28.194
drop the tempo.

12:29.628 --> 12:32.164
Instant sexy.

12:32.231 --> 12:34.433
Pretty tight, huh?

12:36.969 --> 12:39.071
So how'd you learn
how to make music?

12:40.539 --> 12:41.740
Really want to know?

12:42.007 --> 12:43.642
Of course I want to know.

12:43.709 --> 12:45.277
Well...

12:45.344 --> 12:48.247
when my mom kicked me out,

12:48.314 --> 12:51.150
I crashed at a friend's place,

12:51.217 --> 12:53.252
and he had
some old equipment.

12:53.319 --> 12:55.287
So I taught myself.

12:56.522 --> 12:59.425
Your mom kicked you out?

12:59.491 --> 13:00.993
It's a good thing
she did,

13:01.060 --> 13:02.461
because if she hadn't,

13:02.528 --> 13:05.331
the world wouldn't get
to experience Slick Nic.

13:05.397 --> 13:06.532
( laughs )

13:06.599 --> 13:08.434
Well, you're good.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.969
You think?

13:10.035 --> 13:12.371
Come on,
you know you are.

13:12.438 --> 13:16.675
I guess I just like
to hear it.

13:16.742 --> 13:18.677
Especially from you.

13:22.414 --> 13:24.283
Let me show you
how this works.

13:26.218 --> 13:28.087
( volume increasing )

13:28.153 --> 13:30.022
( sighs )

13:30.089 --> 13:31.223
Jeez.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.325
( car horn honks )

13:37.062 --> 13:38.664
Well, get out of here,
you son of a bitch!

13:38.731 --> 13:40.432
Stop--

13:40.499 --> 13:42.534
Ceci, what the hell
are you doing?

13:43.736 --> 13:46.038
I'm waiting for the bus.

13:46.105 --> 13:47.706
It's late.
Come on, get in the car.

13:59.551 --> 14:01.987
I thought Pedro
was picking you up tonight.

14:02.054 --> 14:03.989
What happened?

14:04.056 --> 14:05.658
He had to work late.

14:05.724 --> 14:08.027
JACOB:
Doesn't he sell cars?

14:08.093 --> 14:10.596
CECI:
He does.

14:10.663 --> 14:13.732
This late? Who does he sell to,
tweekers?

14:13.999 --> 14:15.567
Hey, what's with all
the questions?

14:15.634 --> 14:17.536
Pedro works really hard.

14:17.603 --> 14:20.105
He's a really great provider,
treats me and Isela really good.

14:20.172 --> 14:22.408
I'm really lucky
to be with him.

14:22.474 --> 14:23.742
Really?

14:24.009 --> 14:25.344
What?

14:25.411 --> 14:28.147
Nothing, you just said "really"
like five times.

14:29.615 --> 14:32.284
I'm sure your boyfriend
must be really great.

14:32.351 --> 14:35.154
That's because he is.

14:37.356 --> 14:39.158
( funky music playing )

14:39.224 --> 14:41.327
Do you remember
our first kiss?

14:41.393 --> 14:42.995
( laughs )

14:43.062 --> 14:44.263
How could I forget?

14:44.330 --> 14:45.631
You had bubble gum breath.

14:45.698 --> 14:47.199
You bit my lip.

14:47.266 --> 14:49.335
Hey, I was nervous.
It was my first time.

14:49.401 --> 14:51.170
Me too.

14:51.236 --> 14:53.505
Liar.
I'm serious.

14:53.572 --> 14:55.174
Whatever.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.443
You were like the cutest kid
on the block.

14:57.509 --> 14:59.979
You had all the girls
chasing after you

15:00.045 --> 15:01.547
like the chocolate milk boy.

15:01.613 --> 15:03.449
And who was the boy
always chasing you?

15:03.515 --> 15:07.152
Who's still chasing you.

15:08.954 --> 15:10.222
I can't.

15:10.289 --> 15:12.257
( laughs )

15:12.324 --> 15:14.059
Why?

15:15.494 --> 15:17.096
Another guy?

15:17.162 --> 15:18.530
( laughs )

15:18.597 --> 15:22.534
No. There's no other guy.

15:22.601 --> 15:25.471
It was really nice
meeting you.

15:25.537 --> 15:27.239
I had a really good time.

15:27.306 --> 15:29.608
Yeah, me too.

15:29.675 --> 15:32.411
So I'll see you around.

15:32.478 --> 15:34.480
Hey, Veronica.

15:34.546 --> 15:37.082
Um...

15:37.149 --> 15:38.951
About what you asked me.

15:39.018 --> 15:40.285
I'm sorry.

15:40.352 --> 15:42.254
That was none of my business.

15:42.321 --> 15:44.023
No, no, it's cool.

15:44.089 --> 15:45.524
It's just...

15:47.226 --> 15:50.229
I just started
seeing someone.

15:50.295 --> 15:53.032
I'm still really new
at this.

15:53.098 --> 15:55.067
Hey, I get it.

15:55.134 --> 15:57.336
I've been there.

16:00.072 --> 16:04.410
Let me give you my number.
If you ever need to talk...

16:04.476 --> 16:08.480
or if it doesn't work out
with this someone.

16:08.547 --> 16:10.215
( laughs )

16:12.418 --> 16:13.619
Um, okay.

16:13.685 --> 16:15.120
What's your number?

16:15.187 --> 16:17.423
Here, I'll do it.

16:23.429 --> 16:24.596
CECI:
Just drop me off here.

16:24.663 --> 16:26.698
JACOB: Where, Ceci?
Here!

16:37.176 --> 16:38.710
I thought you said
you lived back there.

16:38.977 --> 16:41.180
Hey, Jacob,
just go home!

16:41.246 --> 16:43.715
Ceci, stop trippin'.
Just get back in the car.

16:54.059 --> 16:55.627
What is wrong with you?

16:55.694 --> 16:57.463
Stop trippin' and just tell me
where you live.

16:57.529 --> 16:58.964
Just keep driving.

17:00.966 --> 17:03.535
So no other guy?

17:03.602 --> 17:06.105
What is it then?

17:06.171 --> 17:09.741
It's...complicated.

17:10.008 --> 17:12.244
Complicated is a lot better
than unavailable,

17:12.311 --> 17:14.213
know what I'm saying?
( both laugh )

17:16.381 --> 17:19.384
You just don't give up,
do you?

17:19.451 --> 17:21.553
On you?

17:21.620 --> 17:22.988
Nunca.

17:23.055 --> 17:25.190
( door opens )
REMY: Oh.

17:25.257 --> 17:27.993
Get a room, player.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.095
Right after you deliver
these tracks.

17:30.162 --> 17:32.131
Uh. Remy.

17:32.197 --> 17:36.001
And you,
come back any time.

17:50.449 --> 17:53.218
Such a gentleman.

17:54.620 --> 17:57.156
What you look away for, huh?

17:57.222 --> 17:58.590
I still see you
smiling.

17:58.657 --> 18:00.359
Shut up.

18:00.425 --> 18:02.494
Oh, I think that means
you had a good night tonight.

18:02.561 --> 18:04.196
It was all right.

18:04.263 --> 18:05.564
Mm-hmm?

18:13.505 --> 18:15.340
( moans )

18:16.742 --> 18:19.044
( cell phone vibrates
and chimes )

18:22.614 --> 18:24.650
( vibrating and chiming
continues )

18:24.716 --> 18:26.518
Somebody's jealous.

18:26.585 --> 18:28.086
( sighs )

18:28.153 --> 18:30.022
Freaking Remy.

18:30.088 --> 18:33.158
He's gonna keep cock-blocking
till I deliver those tracks.

18:33.225 --> 18:35.561
Just tell him--
Tell him to send it online.

18:35.627 --> 18:38.530
He's like 30.
He was born before the Internet.

18:41.466 --> 18:43.168
I gotta go.

18:43.235 --> 18:45.170
( moans )

18:45.237 --> 18:47.439
Yeah, you better go,

18:47.506 --> 18:49.441
or he won't pay you.

18:49.508 --> 18:51.343
Oh, I forgot,
you don't get paid.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.111
Oh, I get paid.

18:53.178 --> 18:55.147
In kisses.

19:04.523 --> 19:06.525
Gina?

19:06.592 --> 19:08.393
( groans )
Are you okay?

19:08.460 --> 19:10.329
Where's Diego?

19:10.395 --> 19:12.064
I drank too much.

19:12.130 --> 19:15.067
Nothing even happened.

19:15.133 --> 19:17.069
Dang, did you throw up?

19:17.135 --> 19:19.471
Let me get you
some water.

Yeah.

19:40.025 --> 19:42.361
He's got no idea.

19:42.427 --> 19:44.663

Yes! I know where I live, fool.

20:09.354 --> 20:10.589
Thanks for the ride.

( sighs )

20:56.101 --> 20:59.104
Good night, Iselita.

21:02.174 --> 21:03.475
Hi, mijo.
How'd it go?

21:03.542 --> 21:05.644
I crushed it, Nana.

21:05.711 --> 21:07.145
Mmm!

21:07.212 --> 21:08.613
And then I took Camila
to the studio

21:08.680 --> 21:10.282
and I played her
my new track.

21:10.349 --> 21:11.683
Qué bueno.
Oh, thank you.

21:11.950 --> 21:13.518
I always thought there was
something special

21:13.585 --> 21:15.153
between you
 y la Camila, que no?

21:15.220 --> 21:16.555
Always, for me.

21:16.621 --> 21:19.558
Mmm, coming back here
was the best thing I ever did.

21:19.624 --> 21:21.727
( speaks in Spanish )

21:21.993 --> 21:24.162
I'm so glad you had
a good time.

21:24.229 --> 21:26.031
Nana, not good.

21:26.098 --> 21:27.666
Legendary.

21:27.733 --> 21:30.035
( both laugh )

21:38.410 --> 21:40.412
How'd you get home?

21:40.479 --> 21:42.614
I got a ride.

21:46.084 --> 21:47.953
Pedro, what the hell
is your problem?

21:48.019 --> 21:49.621
You're lying.
What?

21:49.688 --> 21:51.423
I saw you getting out of his car
barefoot

21:51.490 --> 21:53.658
like some walk-of-shame bitch.
What was I supposed to do?

21:53.725 --> 21:57.996
There was no bus
and you left me there.

21:58.063 --> 21:59.731
Look, can we just
start over?

21:59.998 --> 22:02.567
Come on, let's just forget about
this whole night and this.

22:02.634 --> 22:04.169
Let me make it up to you,
okay, babe?

22:04.236 --> 22:06.138
Get your hands off me, skank.

22:06.204 --> 22:09.508
You're so lucky I don't throw
your ass out on the street.

22:09.574 --> 22:12.444
So lucky, Ceci!

22:12.511 --> 22:14.513
( crying )
Shit!

22:14.579 --> 22:17.282
( Isela crying )

22:21.486 --> 22:24.322
( upbeat pop theme playing )
