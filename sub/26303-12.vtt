WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.006
- Hey, yo, you wanna put
your hands up,

00:06.049 --> 00:07.007
because we're going all out.

00:19.149 --> 00:20.933
- All right, so where's
the supplier?

00:20.977 --> 00:22.631
- I'm not sure.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.503
My contact's gonna meet the guy
upstairs at the card game.

00:25.547 --> 00:29.116
It wasn't easy getting you guys
in here, making you look legit.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.508
- That's part of your deal.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.380
- This gonna be enough
to clear my case?

00:32.423 --> 00:34.077
- You get us the guy
selling China White,

00:34.121 --> 00:37.080
I'm gonna clear your record
and never bother you again.

00:37.124 --> 00:40.170
- Get eyes upstairs,
let's ID the supplier.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.825
- Who's this guy?

00:42.868 --> 00:45.175
Three body guards, wad of cash.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.699
Looks like this guy's
coming to play.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.266
- All right, heads up.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.878
We got a male, Hispanic, 30s,
5'7", buck-50.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.881
He's in a blue coat coming in
with three additional.

00:55.925 --> 00:57.579
- Copy that.

01:00.843 --> 01:03.585
All right, game on.

01:03.628 --> 01:05.587
- We got a positive ID
on facial rec,

01:05.630 --> 01:07.154
Frank Delgado,
got a sheet here,

01:07.197 --> 01:08.155
multiple drug arrests.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.418
He just walked in.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.202
- Frank, now we got a game.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.725
Sit down so I can take
your money.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.385
Well, well, well, well, well,
well, well.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.344
- Can I pour you gentlemen
some shots?

01:23.387 --> 01:25.476
- Yeah, let's get a round.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.696
- So, uh, what's your name?

01:27.739 --> 01:29.045
- Candy.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.830
You know, I got a bit of
a sweet tooth.

01:31.874 --> 01:34.572
- You know, I get that
all the time.

01:34.616 --> 01:39.708
- Listen, Candy, I'll give you
$500 to take off your dress.

01:39.751 --> 01:43.233
- The bar has a pretty strict
dress code.

01:43.277 --> 01:46.584
- A thousand.

01:47.846 --> 01:50.762
- There we go, smile for
the camera, you jagoff.

01:50.806 --> 01:54.418
- We got eyes on the supplier
yet?

01:54.462 --> 01:55.289
- Whoo.

01:55.332 --> 01:56.551
Yeah, facial rec just popped,

01:56.594 --> 01:58.640
Matthew Garrett,
lighting up the board.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.250
He's got multiple
drug arrests.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.470
- Matthew Garret?
That's not possible.

02:02.513 --> 02:03.775
- Am I blind?
I mean...

02:03.819 --> 02:05.473
Yeah, Pontiac Prison,
he just go released.

02:10.695 --> 02:11.827
- That's our guy.

02:11.870 --> 02:13.263
- Son of a bitch.
This can't be happening.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.439
- What are you talking about?

02:15.483 --> 02:17.833
- I got history with him.
He can't see me.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.791
- He knows you?

02:24.013 --> 02:25.014
- Why are you leaving?

02:25.057 --> 02:26.494
- It's a long story.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.452
- Okay, but I did my thing,
so we're all good, right?

02:28.496 --> 02:30.237
- Yeah, you did great.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.283
Come on.
Come on, we gotta go.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.459
- Hey, yo.
Yo, I know you.

02:35.503 --> 02:37.200
- Nah, I think you got me
mixed up with somebody, man.

02:37.244 --> 02:40.377
- Nah, nah, nah,
you're that cop, Halstead.

02:41.726 --> 02:45.208
- You're that punk that murders
teenage girls, Garrett.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.475
Watch yourself.
- What are you gonna do, cop?

02:51.519 --> 02:53.869
You gonna hit me?

02:53.912 --> 02:55.087
That's what you wanna do?

02:55.131 --> 02:56.524
Come on, please, right here.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.179
Please, take a swing,
I'm begging you, please.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.006
Oh, my God, Chicago PD,
they might give me

03:01.050 --> 03:02.225
another 200K, maybe even more.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.313
Right here, sweetheart,
don't miss.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.315
- Come on, come on, let's go.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.709
This dude ain't worth it.

03:11.016 --> 03:14.237
- See you around, Halstead,
you coward.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.327
- Who is that?
- The devil.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.508
- The mystery player
bringing in China White

03:24.552 --> 03:25.857
is Matthew Garrett.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.250
He was doing 20 years for
possession

03:27.294 --> 03:28.512
with intent to distribute,

03:28.556 --> 03:30.514
served six, was released
last month.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.951
- So the police put in
the proper paperwork

03:32.995 --> 03:34.257
before they did the bust.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.867
It was deemed
an illegal search.

03:35.911 --> 03:39.044
That's why the city awarded
Garrett $200,000

03:39.088 --> 03:40.307
for wrongful arrest.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.873
- Huh.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.353
- Now he's using the settlement
from the city

03:43.397 --> 03:44.659
to corner the market on
high-end heroin.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.313
- Gotta love
the justice system.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.619
- I get it,
but we gotta stand down.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.100
Ivory tower doesn't want us
chasing these so-called

03:51.143 --> 03:52.275
wrongful conviction
offenders.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.364
- Sarge, to hell with that.

03:54.408 --> 03:57.237
Garrett's not just a drug
dealer, he's a murderer.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.716
He killed Lauren Sanders.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.371
She was 17 years old,
she ran away from home.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.546
Garrett found her,
he pimped her out,

04:02.590 --> 04:04.374
and then she just disappeared.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.072
We found her bloody clothes
in a dumpster.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.075
We never found her body,
so we couldn't make the case.

04:10.119 --> 04:14.210
All due respect, standing down
should not be an option.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.913
- Okay, let's go after him.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.264
I mean, the good news is,
prick's got ambition,

04:24.307 --> 04:27.310
means we can catch him dirty,
put him away once and for all.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.312
So dig into Garrett's
associates,

04:29.356 --> 04:31.096
talk to your C.I.'s,
let's find a way in.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.272
Set up a buy/bust.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.490
So who made the arrest,

04:33.534 --> 04:35.100
put him away
in the first place?

04:35.144 --> 04:37.799
- Narcotics, Garrett was part
of the Beverly Crew.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.192
- That's good,
I got a guy who can help.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.934
- Thanks, Sarge.
- Hmm.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.894
I gotta tell you, Gus,
you have not aged.

04:45.937 --> 04:49.376
- Tell that to my knees.

04:49.419 --> 04:52.074
Hey, thanks. How's Erika?

04:52.117 --> 04:53.597
- She's back in Florida.

04:53.641 --> 04:57.166
Got the place all to myself.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.907
- Miss seeing you around, bro.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.605
- Well, if you get nostalgic,
I'm still on YouTube.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.433
1.6 million views,

05:03.477 --> 05:05.522
everywhere I go,
people know me.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.176
Last time I went out for
a cup of coffee,

05:07.219 --> 05:09.091
the barista spit in my face.

05:09.134 --> 05:10.527
- Jesus.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.312
- That video didn't show

05:12.355 --> 05:14.836
the dirtbag beating the hell
out of his pregnant girlfriend,

05:14.879 --> 05:18.056
just the part where
I pulled him off...

05:18.100 --> 05:19.449
did what I did.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.190
Heat of the moment.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.626
- I know.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.325
- 23-year career down
the drain in 19 seconds.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.848
What are you gonna do?

05:26.891 --> 05:31.374
- Hmm.
Let me ask you something, Gus.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.420
When you took down
the Beverly Crew,

05:33.463 --> 05:35.987
you come across a guy named
Matthew Garrett?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.729
- Oh, yeah.
I buried his ass.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.383
- Well, you didn't bury him
deep enough,

05:40.427 --> 05:41.906
he just got released.

05:41.950 --> 05:42.951
- You kidding?

05:42.994 --> 05:44.169
- Yeah, he's back out
on the street,

05:44.213 --> 05:46.171
he's dealing high-end heroin,

05:46.215 --> 05:48.348
so we're looking for a way in.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.958
I thought maybe
you might have an idea.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.308
- Garrett had a sweet spot
for his little cousin,

05:52.352 --> 05:53.701
kid named Tyler Reynolds.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.833
- Right, you know where I can
find this Tyler kid?

05:55.877 --> 05:58.662
- He's doing 10 years at
Stateville for armed robbery.

05:58.706 --> 06:03.014
Tyler was just the driver,
he took the weight for Garrett.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.276
- Hmm.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.192
Yeah, I think I can work
with that.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.977
Appreciate your time, Gus.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.109
Listen, you need anything,
you let me know.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.676
- No, I'm good, Hank.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.678
Got half my pension,
my health.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.768
And who the hell would wanna be
a cop in this day and age?

06:25.210 --> 06:28.300
- Matt Garrett.

06:28.344 --> 06:31.826
Right?
- Hey, yo.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.436
- Easy, man.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.133
- Who the hell are you?

06:35.177 --> 06:37.701
- I'm Chris Wilson,
I'm a friend of Tyler's.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.877
We're neighbors on cell bock H.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.923
- Tyler didn't tell me
he had a boyfriend.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.751
Hadn't said anything about you.

06:43.794 --> 06:46.318
- Well, he said a lot
about you.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.538
How he took the weight for that
robbery back in the day,

06:48.582 --> 06:50.366
and you owe him a favor.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.889
I'm the favor.

06:53.630 --> 06:56.459
You can call him,
he'll vouch for me.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.984
- Does Tyler still got that
funny little scar on his head?

07:00.028 --> 07:02.465
- Tyler doesn't have any scars,
he's a baby face.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.468
Maybe you forgot,
maybe you need to go see him.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.991
- So what'd they pop you for,
Christopher?

07:07.035 --> 07:10.342
- Cops hung a armed robbery
charge on me.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.693
- Hmm.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.782
Come over here a second.

07:19.787 --> 07:24.052
- So listen, Tyler told me
you were the guy

07:24.095 --> 07:26.271
to talk to about heroin.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.751
- You're in the game, right?

07:27.795 --> 07:29.144
You dole out supplies,
why are you coming to me,

07:29.187 --> 07:30.362
to a complete stranger?

07:30.406 --> 07:32.930
- Apparently you have
China White.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.932
Yeah?

07:34.976 --> 07:38.022
Look man, I got a lot of
clients in the north burbs,

07:38.066 --> 07:40.851
and they don't want that
dirty brown heroin.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.853
These are white people
that want white stuff.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.813
They got the green
to pay for it.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.206
- How 'bout you, Chris?
You got the green?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.992
- I can get it, yeah.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.081
- Tell you what,
I'll touch base with Tyler.

07:53.124 --> 07:55.823
If your story checks out,
maybe we can do business.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.651
- All right, works for me.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.391
- The buy-in's 50K.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.263
- I can make that happen.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.004
- And I'll need that by today.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.049
- By today.

08:05.093 --> 08:08.488
- Shouldn't be a problem,
if you're serious.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.141
All right?

08:10.185 --> 08:12.666
Hey, Santana,
let's get out of here.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.364
- See you, pal.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.239
- Sir.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.069
Superintendent.
- Sergeant.

08:33.295 --> 08:34.644
You called me?

08:34.688 --> 08:39.649
- Yeah, I saw your request
for 1505 funds.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.869
- I'm not sure how that
ended up on your desk.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.348
- Well, it's a new policy.

08:43.392 --> 08:45.655
Anything $50,000 or over
requires my approval.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.178
What's it for?

08:47.222 --> 08:49.572
- We got a time-sensitive play
on an offender

08:49.616 --> 08:50.660
dealing bulk heroin.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.532
- And who's the offender?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.359
- Matthew Garrett.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.057
- As in the Matthew Garrett

08:56.100 --> 08:57.711
who was just released
from prison?

08:57.754 --> 09:00.191
- We weren't targeting Garrett.

09:00.235 --> 09:03.455
Chased that heroin case,
he just fell in our lap.

09:03.499 --> 09:06.981
- We just cut this bastard
a check for $200,000.

09:07.024 --> 09:09.984
It was a big, fat black eye
for this department

09:10.027 --> 09:11.768
and for the city.
- I get it.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.858
We can't be cute,
too many eyes on us.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.599
You authorize that 50K,

09:16.643 --> 09:19.080
I can have Garrett in bracelets
tonight.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.475
- Look, we all hate this prick
and yes,

09:23.519 --> 09:25.695
he belongs behind bars.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.480
But I cannot have members of
the CPD out there

09:28.524 --> 09:32.876
acting like vigilantes,
not at this point in time.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.054
There's about
100 different ways

09:37.098 --> 09:39.143
this whole thing could go
wrong.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.060
Walk away, Sergeant.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.106
- Yes, sir.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.459
- Jay.
Hey.

09:50.502 --> 09:51.895
You all right? Where you going?

09:51.939 --> 09:53.244
- No, I just got off the phone
with Voight.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.898
He said Kelton denied
the 1505 funds.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.944
- He's just covering his ass.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.554
Look, Garrett's doing
bad things,

09:58.598 --> 09:59.729
he's gonna make a mistake.

09:59.773 --> 10:00.904
We'll catch him
sooner or later.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.210
- Hailey, we got him right now.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.428
All we have to do
is make a deal.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.605
- Jay, you got a visitor.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.091
- Hello?

10:16.311 --> 10:18.530
- Do you remember me?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.141
- Yeah, of course,
Mrs. Sanders.

10:20.184 --> 10:23.318
- They released the monster
who murdered my daughter?

10:23.361 --> 10:24.711
And they gave him money?

10:24.754 --> 10:26.364
What kind of world is this?

10:26.408 --> 10:28.932
- I don't know, I really don't.
- What I don't understand

10:28.976 --> 10:31.239
is why
nobody bothered to tell me.

10:31.282 --> 10:35.635
Nobody had the courage
to look me in the eye.

10:35.678 --> 10:36.984
- I'm--I'm so sorry.

10:37.027 --> 10:40.117
- Eight years, and you know
something?

10:40.161 --> 10:44.687
I can't let it go,
because I am so outraged

10:44.731 --> 10:47.995
that he still exists
and my daughter doesn't.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.650
We never even found her body.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.869
- I know, look, I promise you--

10:52.913 --> 10:55.045
- Don't make me
any more promises.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.787
I told you he would kill her.

10:57.831 --> 11:00.137
You were supposed to stop it.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.314
You didn't.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.069
- Hey, Sarge,
I talked to Trudy.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.071
The counterfeit crew that
we busted last year,

11:21.115 --> 11:23.204
the money was still
in the evidence room.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.121
We'll just flash the money,

11:27.164 --> 11:28.339
Garrett's not gonna look
too close.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.732
We got the hook in,

11:29.776 --> 11:31.342
I think we gotta keep the deal
on track--

11:31.386 --> 11:32.866
- Jay, you do know we were told
to stand down, right?

11:32.909 --> 11:34.171
- So you wanna let
this guy go

11:34.215 --> 11:35.477
just because Kelton wants
to be Mayor?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.218
- I don't care about Kelton.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.524
I did some digging
into Matthew Garrett,

11:39.568 --> 11:41.352
got a hit on him as a victim.

11:41.396 --> 11:44.007
Filed an official complaint
against a police officer

11:44.051 --> 11:46.357
who threatened
physical violence.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.055
Turns out,
that officer was you.

11:48.098 --> 11:51.101
- Garrett is an evil guy.
I was just being a cop.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.233
It was a ploy to get me
off his back.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.887
- The allegation was sustained.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.497
Your superior officer
took you off the case.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.021
- I obeyed that order
and a girl went missing.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.589
If we let this deal go away,
then we lose Garrett.

12:00.632 --> 12:03.723
And if he hurts another girl,
that is on us.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.734
You're not the first one
through the door.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.344
You're background.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.827
Hey, you talked to Garrett?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.045
- Yeah, he wants to meet
in an hour.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.787
- All right, confirm the meet.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.484
- So we're back up?
- We are.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.965
Hey, I don't want Adam
going in there alone.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.750
Take someone with you,
right-hand man.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.186
- What about
a right-hand woman?

12:32.229 --> 12:34.754
- Do it. Cameras and mics.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.799
- What about Kelton?

12:36.843 --> 12:39.106
- I'll deal with Kelton.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.896
- We're in position.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.768
- All right, let me know when
you got Garrett in pocket.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.814
Remember Jay,
stay in the shadows.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.773
- Yeah, copy.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.124
- So the mother of
the murdered girl

12:57.167 --> 12:58.603
came to see you?

12:58.647 --> 13:00.562
- Yeah.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.086
- Anything you wanna talk
about?

13:03.130 --> 13:04.261
- No.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.659
All right, here he comes.

13:12.661 --> 13:15.359
- You got Garrett on the way,
and he's got two males with him

13:15.403 --> 13:16.796
and a young girl.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.188
- They're headed towards
the coffee shop.

13:18.232 --> 13:21.061
- Yeah, we see 'em.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.895
How's it going, Matt?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.418
- You didn't say
you were bringing a friend.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.767
- Yeah, I could say
the same to you.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.291
This is my partner,
this is Marcia.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.728
- Shouldn't you be at a kids'
soccer practice or something?

13:36.772 --> 13:39.166
- Exactly, I even drive
a minivan.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.950
- Two traps and a 357,

13:40.994 --> 13:43.910
she's very good at what
she does, I promise.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.085
- And this is?

13:45.128 --> 13:47.000
- Oh, this is Jill.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.653
Hey, why don't you, uh,

13:48.697 --> 13:50.307
go and get yourself
something to eat.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.787
I'll come and find you later.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.223
Get a receipt.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.360
Ah, look at all these
runaways.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.363
They come from all over,

14:02.406 --> 14:05.105
you know, looking for a fix,

14:05.148 --> 14:06.889
trying to find Daddy.

14:06.933 --> 14:11.502
But you get 'em hooked,
they'll do anything you want.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.200
- Amen.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.857
- Is this making you feel
uncomfortable?

14:19.336 --> 14:22.035
- I'll let you boys
talk business.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.517
- Why the hell is Burgess
walking away?

14:26.561 --> 14:29.172
- I got no idea.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.653
Hailey, you got eyes
on Burgess?

14:32.784 --> 14:35.700
- No, I'm not sure
where she went.

14:35.744 --> 14:39.052
- Okay, you said
you wanted serious.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.402
I brought you serious.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.108
- Hey. Jill, right?

14:52.152 --> 14:55.764
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you, Marcia.

14:58.549 --> 15:02.205
So, Jill, how long have you
known Garrett?

15:02.249 --> 15:04.033
- I met him a few days ago.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.038
- Look, I don't know you, Jill,
and you don't know me,

15:09.082 --> 15:13.521
but I do know about Garrett,
and he is not a good guy, okay?

15:13.564 --> 15:15.001
- He's nice to me.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.567
- Let me guess, he took you
to a fancy dinner

15:16.611 --> 15:17.917
and bought you some nice,
new clothes?

15:17.960 --> 15:20.223
Right?
Come on, Jill, think about it.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.616
You know where this is going,

15:21.659 --> 15:23.444
you know what he's gonna
ask you to do next.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.142
- Why are you doing this?

15:26.186 --> 15:28.231
- My sister was hurt by a man
like that.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.755
I don't want it to happen
to you too.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.062
Do you any place else
you can go, just any place?

15:33.106 --> 15:34.411
- No.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.065
- Here.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.762
This is $200, I want you to go
out the back door

15:37.806 --> 15:39.068
and get away from this guy.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.591
You just call your parents
or your friends.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.985
Just get out of here, okay?

15:43.029 --> 15:44.987
Okay, now I need you to move,
okay?

15:45.031 --> 15:46.119
Go, go, go.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.426
- So where'd your partner go?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.559
- I'm guessing a little
pick-me-up.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.300
- How do I know
she can be trusted?

15:53.343 --> 15:57.739
- Don't worry about her,
you're just dealing with me.

15:57.782 --> 16:00.698
Come on, let's pick a spot,
get this deal done.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.788
I got 50K burning a hole
in this bag.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.184
Let's get this deal done.
- Come on, let's go.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.580
- Garrett's on the move.

16:14.321 --> 16:15.626
- Where is she?

16:15.670 --> 16:17.106
- Who?
- Jill, the girl I was with.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.455
Where is she?

16:18.499 --> 16:19.891
- I don't know.
- Is she in there?

16:19.935 --> 16:22.416
- I don't think so.
- Go and check. Check.

16:22.459 --> 16:25.636
- Look, man, I'm not trying to
push you or anything,

16:25.680 --> 16:27.029
but I got a lot of money here,

16:27.073 --> 16:28.291
I'm starting to get
a little nervous.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.815
You wanna do this deal or not?

16:30.859 --> 16:33.296
- You keep your phone on,
I'll be in touch.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.732
- Okay.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.043
Boss.
- Yeah?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.045
- Talked to Garrett,
the deal's on.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.525
- All right, you got
a location?

16:44.568 --> 16:46.048
- Yeah, Beverly Yards,
tomorrow at noon.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.355
- All right, get the
surveillance van, cameras.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.921
Let's nail this guy.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.314
Jay, remember,
you're background,

16:51.358 --> 16:53.534
you got the long-eye.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.581
- No sign of Garrett.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.152
- Okay, well, we got
a blue coupe headed your way,

17:03.196 --> 17:05.720
might be our target,
two passengers.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.679
- Here we go, game time.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.467
- We don't pounce till
we see those drugs.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.651
- What the hell?
Garrett's not in the car.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.097
Where's Garrett?
- He's with the dope.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.881
He's not moving until
you give me that money.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.274
- What, do you we think
we're stupid?

17:38.318 --> 17:39.884
The deal was a hand-to-hand
with Garrett,

17:39.928 --> 17:41.190
that was the deal.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.670
- He never said anything about
a let-go, man.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.106
So we're not gonna let go.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.890
- You are if you want
your product.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.372
- Look, man, we want
the product,

17:49.416 --> 17:51.635
you're just changing the rules
in the middle of the game.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.028
All right,
here's what we'll do.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.335
I'll stay here with you
and the money,

17:55.378 --> 17:57.032
she'll go pick up the drugs.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.600
Why don't you call Garrett
and tell him the new plan?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.734
- You gonna call him or are
we gonna go our separate ways?

18:13.701 --> 18:14.702
- He's not answering.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.185
- You know the address?

18:20.664 --> 18:22.492
All right, I'm gonna take that
as a yes.

18:22.536 --> 18:23.754
Why don't you just tell us,

18:23.798 --> 18:26.148
and we'll go meet him
in person?

18:27.323 --> 18:31.197
Tell us now or we take
the money and we walk.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.198
Last chance.

18:33.851 --> 18:37.246
- I see, this guy's a chump.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.814
You don't know anything.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.252
- It's the old warehouse...

18:43.296 --> 18:44.645
On McKenzie.

18:51.913 --> 18:55.003
- 5021 George,
what's your 20?

18:55.046 --> 18:57.179
Halstead, you cop--

19:36.566 --> 19:38.046
- Oh, it's you.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.266
- Yeah, that's right.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.093
What happened, Garrett?
Who did this?

19:42.137 --> 19:44.835
Hey, Garrett, listen to me.
I will get you help.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.098
I'll call you an ambulance.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.492
You gotta tell me, where is
Lauren Sanders' body?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.929
- Call an ambulance.
- No, you make this right.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.017
You make this right,

19:53.061 --> 19:54.323
you tell me where her body is,

19:54.367 --> 19:55.846
and I will call you
an ambulance.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.326
You understand me?

19:57.370 --> 19:59.850
Garrett, you got a chance
to do something good.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.287
You can make amends.

20:06.074 --> 20:09.730
Kiss my ass.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.862
- Garrett.

20:11.906 --> 20:15.866
Garrett. Garrett!

20:22.003 --> 20:25.876
- Jay?
You all right?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.922
- Yeah.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.359
- What the hell happened?

20:42.023 --> 20:44.373
- That is exactly how
I found him.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.027
I arrived, I cleared
the premises first,

20:46.070 --> 20:47.158
I tried to render aid...

20:47.202 --> 20:48.421
- Hmm.

20:48.464 --> 20:51.467
- And then Hailey arrived
just after me.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.990
- And the China White?

20:53.034 --> 20:54.340
- Nothing yet, still looking.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.211
- We talked to a crime tech,

20:56.255 --> 20:58.169
preliminary time of death
is 12:10.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.388
- Hmm.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.998
- Hailey called us over
at 12:23.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.697
Whoever killed this guy,
we just missed him.

21:03.740 --> 21:05.176
- Hello, Leonard.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.439
- Intelligence in the house.
- Hey.

21:06.482 --> 21:07.657
- And I thought I was gonna be
figuring out

21:07.701 --> 21:09.355
who killed some worthless
bad guy.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.965
- He was worthless all right.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.272
Trying to set up a drug bust,
somebody got here first.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.534
- So your guy see anything?

21:14.577 --> 21:16.100
- No, he was dead when
we got here.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.015
- Murder weapon?
- Didn't find one.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.366
Didn't find the drugs either,
figured whoever killed him

21:20.409 --> 21:21.367
probably took 'em.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.455
- So who found the body?

21:22.498 --> 21:24.065
- One of my guys.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.153
- Well, that's more of
a head start

21:25.196 --> 21:26.546
than I usually get.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.330
We'll take it from here, man.
- You know what?

21:28.374 --> 21:31.072
If you don't mind, Leonard,
we'd like to run with this one.

21:31.115 --> 21:32.726
- Why?

21:32.769 --> 21:35.946
- DOA was our target,
we were told to stand down

21:35.990 --> 21:37.774
not work him, so...

21:38.601 --> 21:40.386
There's gonna be headaches
on this,

21:40.429 --> 21:41.822
I don't wanna get you
jammed up.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.389
- Okay, be my guest.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.440
- So?

21:52.572 --> 21:54.356
- I know I shouldn't have
gone in without backup,

21:54.400 --> 21:56.271
but the deal was going
sideways and we were gonna--

21:56.315 --> 21:57.620
- Jay, I think you
and I both know

21:57.664 --> 21:59.796
that's not the question
you're gonna answer.

22:00.971 --> 22:04.932
Upton found you standing over
Garrett's dead body, alone,

22:04.975 --> 22:07.282
in a situation you would never
and should never

22:07.326 --> 22:08.718
enter without backup.

22:08.762 --> 22:11.025
So what the hell happened
in there?

22:13.288 --> 22:15.029
- He was alive
when I got there.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.512
Somebody already shot him.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.688
I don't know who,
there was nobody else around.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.865
- Why didn't you call it in?

22:26.257 --> 22:28.216
- 'Cause I knew he wasn't
gonna make it.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.435
I've seen enough
of those injuries.

22:29.478 --> 22:31.393
- Uh-huh.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.922
- I wanted to find out
where Lauren's body was

22:38.966 --> 22:40.794
for her mother.

22:40.837 --> 22:41.795
- Huh.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.405
- So I gave that prick
one chance

22:43.449 --> 22:46.147
to redeem his miserable life,
he didn't take it.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.671
He told me to kiss his ass.

22:50.194 --> 22:51.718
- Okay.

22:53.981 --> 22:58.594
Listen, anybody asks you,
I mean, anybody...

22:58.638 --> 23:01.031
Garrett was dead
when you got there.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.819
That's it. Hmm?

23:05.862 --> 23:07.429
- All right.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.127
Thanks, Sarge.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.694
- Okay.

23:13.653 --> 23:15.698
- Sarge, check this out.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.787
Casing found at the scene,
it looks like a match to

23:17.831 --> 23:19.572
the slug that killed Garrett.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.182
- All right, well, let's hear
what Ballistics says.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.357
We got anything else?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.750
- No, we got nothing, Sarge.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.578
We got no weapons,
no witnesses, no dope.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.754
- No sign of struggle either,
which suggests Garrett

23:27.797 --> 23:29.886
either knew his assailant
or was caught by surprise.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.192
- He got popped
for his product.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.498
- Yeah.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.021
- Isn't it ironic
that we're the ones

23:34.064 --> 23:35.457
that have to clear the murder
for this prick?

23:35.501 --> 23:37.067
- Well, that's what
we gotta do.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.374
So let's call in favors
with everyone who can help.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.811
Okay, I don't care how much
we hated this son of a bitch,

23:41.855 --> 23:43.726
we gotta find who killed him,
fast.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.511
Hey, dig back into that
card game.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.034
Who the hell had a beef
with Garrett?

23:47.077 --> 23:48.688
Let's hit everyone
at that card game.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.864
- I just got a tip
from a C.I.

23:50.907 --> 23:53.127
Someone's looking to move
a lot of China White

23:53.170 --> 23:54.128
on the south side.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.346
- Location?

23:55.390 --> 23:56.696
- Uh, Chicago Convention
Center,

23:56.739 --> 23:58.828
drop's gonna be in
an employee locker.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.221
- Hit it.

24:12.015 --> 24:13.582
- Uh-uh.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.199
Ah, get off me!

24:23.636 --> 24:25.812
- Oh, Santana,
you remember me?

24:25.855 --> 24:27.161
- I remember you.

24:27.204 --> 24:28.945
- Come on, man.
Come on.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.643
- Stop.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.907
- Ask him if he dropped
something.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.258
- You drop something?

24:41.784 --> 24:43.525
- We found your friend
at the west side warehouse

24:43.569 --> 24:44.961
with a bullet in his neck.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.528
- I don't know nothing
about that.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.095
- Really, you sure?

24:48.138 --> 24:49.575
'Cause he happened to be
missing a kilo of China White

24:49.618 --> 24:51.141
we found in
your duffle bag.

24:51.185 --> 24:55.406
- We also got a footprint
from that crime scene.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.756
You a size 11?

24:56.799 --> 24:58.322
- That don't mean I killed him.

24:58.366 --> 24:59.672
- Does mean you were there.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.935
- Mike, this thing is pretty
open and shut.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.371
We're just going through
the formalities,

25:03.414 --> 25:04.677
so we can go home.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.766
So if you have anything
to say, say it now.

25:06.809 --> 25:09.638
- Look, Garrett and I were
there to do a deal.

25:09.682 --> 25:11.945
I was outside the warehouse,
heard the gunshot,

25:11.988 --> 25:13.337
and ran inside.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.948
I didn't see anyone else.

25:14.991 --> 25:18.473
I swear, that's it.
I didn't kill nobody.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.519
- Mike...

25:20.562 --> 25:21.955
the way I see it,

25:21.998 --> 25:25.480
shooting Matthew Garrett
was a community service.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.786
So you give us
the murder weapon,

25:26.829 --> 25:29.571
help us clear this case,
I'll see if I can have

25:29.615 --> 25:31.442
your charges lowered
to manslaughter.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.009
- I wanna help you, all right?

25:33.053 --> 25:34.794
I'm telling you the truth,
I didn't kill him.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.492
He told me to take the heroin
and run, so I did.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.885
He was alive when I left.

25:38.928 --> 25:40.626
- Where'd you run?
- To my car.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.845
I was parked out back
of the warehouse.

25:48.721 --> 25:50.461
- Hailey, what's up?

25:50.505 --> 25:53.813
- Hey, uh, I got some footage
from the warehouse.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.641
Turns out Santana
was telling the truth.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.947
He left out the back door
at 12:05.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.689
This next part might be
a bit of a problem, though.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.125
You said you got to
the warehouse

26:02.169 --> 26:03.997
a few minutes before us.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.347
- I'm not sure exactly,
but yeah.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.784
- Okay, well...

26:08.828 --> 26:09.872
According to this,
you were there

26:09.916 --> 26:12.092
a full ten minutes before us.

26:15.225 --> 26:18.098
- I mean, I must have been
in there longer than I thought.

26:21.057 --> 26:23.320
- And then you shut off
your radio

26:23.364 --> 26:24.887
before you went inside.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.456
- Yeah.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.371
What are you saying?

26:30.414 --> 26:33.722
- Jay, you went dark before
you went in the warehouse.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.202
You weren't even supposed
to be there

26:35.245 --> 26:36.551
in the first place.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.509
You were alone with Garrett
for ten minutes,

26:38.553 --> 26:40.381
and you never called it in.

26:40.424 --> 26:41.904
If anyone looks at these facts,

26:41.948 --> 26:43.384
given your history
with Garrett,

26:43.427 --> 26:45.952
they're gonna assume
that you had an agenda.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.651
- Is that what you think?

26:49.695 --> 26:51.261
- Come on.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.395
And it doesn't matter
what I think,

26:54.438 --> 26:56.571
these are the questions
they're gonna ask you.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.835
Did you have an agenda?

26:59.879 --> 27:01.358
- The deal was blown,

27:01.402 --> 27:03.012
I thought Garrett was gonna
disappear,

27:03.056 --> 27:04.623
so yeah, I went after him.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.668
I didn't know what I was
gonna do when I saw him.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.192
I didn't know.

27:09.236 --> 27:12.718
He was already bleeding out
when I got there.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.197
- And then what'd you do?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.898
- I knew he wasn't
gonna make it,

27:18.941 --> 27:21.291
and I tried to make him
tell me where her body is.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.733
- Jay...

27:27.776 --> 27:30.474
You crossed lines,
you didn't render aid.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.607
- I know.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.175
- That's official misconduct,
you can go to prison.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.619
- Homicide wants to talk to me.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.978
- Thanks for coming.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.719
- So, uh, what's this about?

27:57.763 --> 28:01.288
- Ah, just clearing up
this Matthew Garrett business.

28:01.331 --> 28:04.160
What a thoroughly despicable
human being.

28:04.204 --> 28:07.033
Good riddance, huh?

28:07.076 --> 28:08.469
- Is that a question?

28:10.514 --> 28:12.081
- Hell of a thing.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.127
Hard enough being a cop
these days;

28:14.170 --> 28:16.520
paperwork, cell phone cameras,

28:16.564 --> 28:19.088
everybody looking for ways
to blow you up.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.830
And a horrible criminal
like Matthew Garrett

28:21.874 --> 28:25.921
gets released with a gift
of $200,000.

28:25.965 --> 28:27.706
- Detective,
stop jerking me around.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.925
You wanna ask me something,
just go ahead and ask me,

28:29.969 --> 28:31.013
otherwise, I'm gonna walk out
of here.

28:33.494 --> 28:36.105
Why'd you go dark?

28:36.149 --> 28:38.020
We pulled the tracking records
from your unit.

28:38.064 --> 28:41.763
You turned off your phone
and your GPS at 12:15.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.853
- I turned my phone off because
I was afraid of a random call

28:44.897 --> 28:46.420
just tipping off our suspect.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.161
- Something else
I don't understand,

28:48.204 --> 28:50.337
you had history
with Garrett.

28:50.380 --> 28:53.993
He would recognize you.
Why go into the warehouse?

28:54.036 --> 28:55.603
- I was in my vehicle,

28:55.646 --> 28:57.561
I was the closest one
to the warehouse,

28:57.605 --> 28:59.520
and I heard over the radio that
the deal was going sideways.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.043
And I knew he had heroin
on him,

29:01.087 --> 29:02.218
so I figured we'd at least
catch him

29:02.262 --> 29:03.306
on a possession charge.

29:03.350 --> 29:04.655
- You didn't wait for backup?

29:04.699 --> 29:06.440
- I was afraid he'd get rid of
the drugs

29:06.483 --> 29:08.224
and then he'd get away.
He'd still be on the street.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.400
You wanna write me up
for being impatient, go ahead.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.799
- So just to confirm...

29:17.843 --> 29:19.932
He was dead when you got there?

29:21.324 --> 29:23.500
- This sounds like I need
my FOP lawyer.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.597
- Just doing
our due diligence.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.904
Appreciate your time,
Detective.

29:41.388 --> 29:44.434
- Why are you jamming up
Jay Halstead?

29:44.478 --> 29:45.914
- Beg your pardon.

29:45.958 --> 29:49.135
- Halstead was doing his job
to apprehend an offender.

29:49.178 --> 29:50.614
- An offender he had
a history with.

29:50.658 --> 29:54.227
Yes, I talked to Tillman,
and he told me there were

29:54.270 --> 29:57.447
problems with Halstead's
version of the events.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.580
This city is no longer
gonna tolerate

29:59.623 --> 30:03.192
cowboy behavior from
its police, not on my watch.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.933
- Lose the campaign speech,
Brian.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.543
There's no cameras here.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.937
How 'bout you and I just shoot
each other straight?

30:08.981 --> 30:10.286
- You wanna shoot it straight,
Hank?

30:10.330 --> 30:11.853
- Yeah!
- I told you to stay the hell

30:11.897 --> 30:12.941
off of this one.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.290
The last thing this city needs

30:14.334 --> 30:15.335
is another cop involved

30:15.378 --> 30:16.902
in a questionable shooting.

30:16.945 --> 30:20.644
And if that is what
this turns out to be,

30:20.688 --> 30:22.385
I'm not coming out on
the wrong side of it.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.083
- Halstead didn't shoot
Garrett.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.606
- Who did?
- I don't know yet!

30:25.649 --> 30:27.956
- Your guy had motive
and he went dark.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.610
This is a murder,

30:29.653 --> 30:32.787
and right now Jay Halstead
is suspect number one.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.882
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.450
- Jay.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.408
Listen, I just talked
to Kelton,

30:45.452 --> 30:46.975
this thing isn't going away.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.325
They're still looking at you
for the Garrett murder.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.675
- Are you telling me
I gotta call my FOP lawyer?

30:51.719 --> 30:53.112
- Well, I wouldn't.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.765
Just spark more attention,
make things worse.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.550
- I think I gotta protect
myself, Sarge.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.769
- I think they best way
for you to protect yourself

30:58.813 --> 31:00.859
is for us to go out there
and the find the guy

31:00.902 --> 31:02.338
who actually did kill Garrett.

31:02.382 --> 31:05.515
Then this whole thing
will just wash away.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.648
- I talked to Maury
at Ballistics...

31:07.691 --> 31:09.171
- Huh.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.694
- They're still working
on the official report

31:10.738 --> 31:12.696
of the Garrett shooting,
but he shared with me

31:12.740 --> 31:13.697
the unofficial report.

31:13.741 --> 31:14.829
- Okay.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.091
- The slug that killed Garrett

31:16.135 --> 31:17.876
is a match to a slug
used at a robbery

31:17.919 --> 31:19.573
at a Pilsen store in 2015.

31:19.616 --> 31:22.010
The guy they busted
was Frank Delgado.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.664
- Delgado was at
the poker game.

31:23.707 --> 31:26.188
- Makes sense, we know he was
after the China White.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.103
- Plus, we got an LKA
in Pilsen.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.409
- All right, so hit it.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.932
Remember, we are on a clock,

31:30.976 --> 31:32.325
so let's make sure
we get this guy.

31:32.368 --> 31:33.717
Jay, you hang here.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.197
I don't want you leaving
the District.

31:41.247 --> 31:42.204
- Chicago PD!

31:44.946 --> 31:46.339
- Clear!

31:47.775 --> 31:50.125
- Clear.
- Clear!

31:50.169 --> 31:51.910
- We got a runner!

31:51.953 --> 31:53.259
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.348
- Wrong exit, pal.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.307
- What the hell are you doing?
Antonio!

31:58.351 --> 31:59.918
- I got him, go ahead.
- I didn't do anything!

31:59.961 --> 32:02.398
- Spread your arms!
Stay still. Give me your hand.

32:02.442 --> 32:03.617
Give me your hand.

32:03.660 --> 32:04.966
- Go.

32:15.455 --> 32:17.936
- We know you were doing
business with Matthew Garrett.

32:17.979 --> 32:21.113
- I don't even know
who that is.

32:21.156 --> 32:22.941
- You sure about that?

32:27.119 --> 32:28.642
Hmm?

32:31.819 --> 32:33.081
- Remember that night?

32:33.125 --> 32:35.257
I got offered $1,000
to take my dress off.

32:35.301 --> 32:38.782
- That guy...yeah.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.349
We played cards.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.917
- You found out he was holding
heroin at the warehouse,

32:42.961 --> 32:46.616
and instead of paying for it...

32:46.660 --> 32:48.792
You put a bullet in his neck.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.707
- Nah, that wasn't me.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.274
- Where were you at noon?

32:52.318 --> 32:54.842
- I was still in bed.
- So you don't have an alibi.

32:56.975 --> 33:00.979
- Look, there's no upside
in taking Garrett out.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.763
He had the hookup
for China White.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.286
He's the golden goose.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.941
- What I don't understand
is we got ballistics back

33:06.985 --> 33:09.117
on the bullet that killed
Garrett.

33:09.161 --> 33:12.686
And it's a match to a Glock 17
you used to rob

33:12.729 --> 33:14.122
a liquor store four years ago.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.038
- I don't got that gun anymore.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.606
When I got busted,
the cops took it off me,

33:19.649 --> 33:21.129
I never seen it again.

33:21.173 --> 33:22.696
- If the cops took it off you,

33:22.739 --> 33:24.176
it would have been booked
in the evidence.

33:24.219 --> 33:27.092
- Then maybe somebody
un-booked it.

33:27.135 --> 33:30.399
Wouldn't be the first time
Chicago Police played dirty.

33:38.103 --> 33:41.019
- Hey, Sarge, I found
the Delgado case file.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.194
- All right,
you go through it?

33:42.237 --> 33:43.847
- Yeah, so according to
the report,

33:43.891 --> 33:45.110
the clerk struggled with
the assailant, Delgado,

33:45.153 --> 33:46.894
before knocking the gun
out of his hands.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.591
And then he claims that he saw
a police officer

33:48.635 --> 33:51.594
pick the gun up
after Delgado fled.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.031
- Then we should have the gun.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.163
- I checked, it never was
booked into evidence.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.513
- Who was the arresting
officer?

34:03.998 --> 34:06.044
- Didn't have anywhere
to put 'em,

34:06.087 --> 34:08.263
so we jammed these scumbags
into a phone booth.

34:08.307 --> 34:11.049
Remembering phone booths?
- Barely.

34:11.092 --> 34:16.054
- Now there's cell phones,
hashtags, social media.

34:17.142 --> 34:20.754
Ask me, technology did not
exactly improve our lives.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.889
- You're right about that.

34:30.981 --> 34:34.811
- I gotta hand it to you, Gus.
You almost pulled it off.

34:34.855 --> 34:37.945
- Not sure what you're saying.

34:37.988 --> 34:41.905
- You know, one thing I can't
figure out is...

34:41.949 --> 34:44.473
How did you know Garrett would
be at the warehouse?

34:44.517 --> 34:48.086
- Now I definitely don't know
what you're saying.

34:48.129 --> 34:51.132
- We know about the gun, Gus.

34:51.176 --> 34:54.353
The Glock 17 you took off
Frank Delgado.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.271
We traced the ballistics.

35:02.622 --> 35:06.060
- Hard to make a case
without recovering the gun.

35:07.975 --> 35:09.368
- We can place you
at the warehouse

35:09.411 --> 35:11.544
at the time of the murder.

35:20.030 --> 35:22.076
How did you know he was there?

35:23.686 --> 35:25.993
- You asking as a cop
or a friend?

35:29.214 --> 35:31.041
- I'm asking.

35:35.220 --> 35:39.137
- When I heard that animal
got released,

35:39.180 --> 35:41.313
something just snapped.

35:43.358 --> 35:48.189
I gave my life for this job
and it was all a joke.

35:48.233 --> 35:49.625
There's no justice anymore.

35:49.669 --> 35:52.237
The system is totally broken.

35:59.069 --> 36:01.071
- So you know what I did?
- Hmm?

36:02.682 --> 36:06.990
- I hit the streets,
just like the old days.

36:07.034 --> 36:09.123
I went digging back
into that world,

36:09.167 --> 36:11.299
worked some leads,
squeezed an old C.I.,

36:11.343 --> 36:14.128
and found out where
the meet was happening.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.738
- So you take him out
during a deal.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.566
- Bad guys killing bad guys.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.220
- Hmm.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.613
- What's CPD's new name
for it?

36:20.656 --> 36:24.182
- Mutual combatants.
- Mutual combatants.

36:24.225 --> 36:25.400
- Yeah.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.968
- Figured the CPD wouldn't look
too hard.

36:28.011 --> 36:30.013
I had no idea
you guys were so close

36:30.057 --> 36:33.103
to setting him up.

36:33.147 --> 36:36.324
The world's a better place
without Matthew Garrett.

36:36.368 --> 36:37.499
Don't you agree?

36:39.240 --> 36:40.589
- I do.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.766
- Maybe you can look
the other way on this one.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.471
- I can't, Gus.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.779
Otherwise, Homicide's gonna
jam up one of my guys.

36:56.823 --> 36:58.259
He's...

36:58.303 --> 37:01.219
I mean,
he's a hell of a cop.

37:03.395 --> 37:05.745
- I was a hell of a cop, Hank.

37:05.788 --> 37:08.269
23 years.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.228
And I got blown up for putting
a beating on

37:10.271 --> 37:11.533
a convicted rapist.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.666
I lost my career,
I lost my wife,

37:13.709 --> 37:15.711
I lost everything.

37:15.755 --> 37:18.540
But this scumbag Garrett?

37:18.584 --> 37:19.889
A drug pusher, a killer,

37:19.933 --> 37:22.065
they put him
back on the street?

37:22.109 --> 37:26.069
He gets 200 grand and I gotta
clip coupons?

37:26.113 --> 37:27.375
What the hell happened?

37:39.300 --> 37:41.476
- You know how this works.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.183
- Can I have a little time
alone?

37:59.799 --> 38:02.149
Wanna get a few things
in order.

38:03.324 --> 38:04.891
- Yeah, sure, of course.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.501
- Thanks, Hank.

38:08.677 --> 38:11.027
You were always
one of the good ones.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.819
- I'll be outside.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.228
- Long week.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.318
- Yeah.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.062
- You all right?

39:33.719 --> 39:36.374
- I just keep thinking
about Lauren's mom.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.247
She'll never have closure.

39:42.467 --> 39:46.253
- I get it, but you can't right
every wrong, Jay.

39:46.296 --> 39:50.736
There's just some things,
some people...

39:50.779 --> 39:52.564
You just gotta let it go.

39:53.913 --> 39:56.959
- How are you supposed to be
a good cop and let things go?

39:57.003 --> 39:58.874
What's the point of the job?

39:58.918 --> 40:02.443
- Well, the job is to do
the best that you can.

40:02.487 --> 40:07.274
Then you go home, pretend like
the bad stuff never happened.

40:09.015 --> 40:11.452
- Is that what you do?

40:11.496 --> 40:12.845
- No.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.849
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

40:29.601 --> 40:32.473
- Is that Adam?

40:32.517 --> 40:34.301
- Yeah.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.610
- You should go.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.007
- Yeah.

40:55.801 --> 40:57.193
I'll see you later.
