WEBVTT

00:25.793 --> 00:27.896
In its 10th year,
Talisman Sabre

00:27.896 --> 00:30.517
is the largest bilateral
training exercise

00:30.517 --> 00:32.448
between our two nations

00:32.448 --> 00:35.551
and the first since signing
the AUKUS agreement.

00:35.551 --> 00:38.241
It's a public reminder
of a friendship

00:38.241 --> 00:42.344
that's spanned every major
conflict since World War I.

00:48.793 --> 00:50.758
What was once
the far side of the world

00:50.758 --> 00:55.172
is now the most contested
patch of water on the planet,

00:55.172 --> 00:59.482
prompting our two nations to
stand side by side once again...

01:01.275 --> 01:03.482
...to ensure this vast
swathe of ocean

01:03.482 --> 01:08.379
remains peaceful and democratic
for generations to come.

01:09.724 --> 01:13.379
It doesn't matter where you're
from or what flag you fly,

01:13.379 --> 01:15.000
that is a peace
worth fighting for.

01:21.172 --> 01:22.172
Oi!

01:28.448 --> 01:29.793
No nukes!

01:29.793 --> 01:31.551
Go home, Yanks!

01:31.551 --> 01:34.344
No nuke subs!

01:34.344 --> 01:37.206
No nuke subs! No nuke subs!
No nuke subs!

02:49.103 --> 02:52.310
No nuke subs!
No nuke subs! No nuke subs!

02:52.310 --> 02:55.793
Oh, wow.
Watch your toes, big fella.

03:02.068 --> 03:05.137
Good morning, 'Rosie'.

03:05.137 --> 03:07.172
Oh, I'll be the judge
of that, mate.

03:07.172 --> 03:10.000
What's this? I thought all
protesters were kept off base.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.206
- Where's McNamara?
- Did his ACL playing touch.

03:13.206 --> 03:15.517
Blue here's with the AFP
Forensic Outreach Program,

03:15.517 --> 03:16.896
so she's gonna tag along

03:16.896 --> 03:18.896
for the next few weeks
till he's back on deck.

03:18.896 --> 03:20.758
So what are we thinking?

03:20.758 --> 03:22.275
Well, it's unclear
at the moment,

03:22.275 --> 03:24.724
but there's swelling
to the liver and the kidneys

03:24.724 --> 03:26.068
and there's a broken rib or two.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.413
What do you think's caused it?

03:27.413 --> 03:29.862
First off, I thought it might
have been a car accident,

03:29.862 --> 03:32.310
but look at this, huh?

03:32.310 --> 03:34.000
- Defensive wounds?
- Uh, yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.034
But have a gander up here.

03:36.931 --> 03:39.586
I thought...

03:39.586 --> 03:42.172
- Are you right?
- Uh...

03:42.172 --> 03:44.241
I thought that might have
been caused by a fight.

03:44.241 --> 03:45.965
There's a subdural
hematoma or something.

03:45.965 --> 03:47.793
I'll know more
when I open him up.

03:47.793 --> 03:50.000
No need.
We'll take it from here.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.413
Special Agent
Michelle Mackey, NCIS,

03:52.413 --> 03:54.379
stationed aboard
the USS 'Ronald Reagan'

03:54.379 --> 03:56.137
as part of
the Agent Afloat Program.

03:56.137 --> 04:00.275
Uh... Well, I'm Dr Roy Penrose.
I'm a forensic pathologist.

04:00.275 --> 04:02.310
I am indentured to the AFP

04:02.310 --> 04:04.275
while I wait for
my retirement...

04:04.275 --> 04:06.275
...or death,
whichever comes first.

04:06.275 --> 04:10.206
Is there something I can do
for you, Agent 'Mackay' the CSI?

04:10.206 --> 04:13.689
NCIS, and it's 'Mackey'.

04:13.689 --> 04:14.758
- I'm good.
- Mmm.

04:14.758 --> 04:17.034
Sergeant Jim Dempsey, AFP.

04:17.965 --> 04:20.344
That is,
Australian Federal Police.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.413
This is my partner Evie Cooper.

04:22.413 --> 04:24.724
He's actually my partner.
I let him pretend.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.344
- Yeah.
- Helps his confidence.

04:26.344 --> 04:28.482
Special Agent DeShawn Jackson.
Great to be here.

04:28.482 --> 04:30.172
So how can
I help you folks?

04:30.172 --> 04:31.586
We're here to bring
Petty Officer Flynn

04:31.586 --> 04:33.689
back to the carrier before
he's repatriated stateside.

04:33.689 --> 04:35.827
Alright, no worries. We'll let
you know when we're done.

04:35.827 --> 04:37.344
That won't be necessary.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.758
Petty Officer Flynn
was a submariner

04:38.758 --> 04:39.931
on the USS 'Navajo'...

04:39.931 --> 04:41.241
I'm aware of that.

04:41.241 --> 04:43.965
...which, like all
American warships,

04:43.965 --> 04:46.000
is sovereign US territory.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.379
Maybe, but your boy here
died in Sydney Harbour

04:49.379 --> 04:51.827
in waters surrounding
an Australian naval base,

04:51.827 --> 04:53.241
so it's all us, I'm afraid.

04:53.241 --> 04:55.137
- Sergeant...
- Just call me JD.

04:55.137 --> 04:58.517
Sergeant, my job
is to investigate crimes

04:58.517 --> 05:00.034
against US naval personnel.

05:00.034 --> 05:03.103
And my job is to enforce
Australian law,

05:03.103 --> 05:05.000
which is why I don't
want to get into

05:05.000 --> 05:06.965
this whole pissing contest here.

05:06.965 --> 05:08.827
- Couldn't agree more.
- Great.

05:08.827 --> 05:10.241
So let's just accept

05:10.241 --> 05:13.241
that I can piss further
than you can, shall we?

05:13.241 --> 05:14.689
Hmm.

05:16.896 --> 05:18.310
One sec.

05:21.137 --> 05:22.413
JD.

05:23.965 --> 05:25.517
Yes, ma'am.

05:25.517 --> 05:29.068
Yep.
Okay, I'll be right there.

05:29.068 --> 05:31.206
Do I have a choice?

05:42.931 --> 05:44.310
Foreign minister's
the equivalent

05:44.310 --> 05:46.379
of your secretary of state.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.793
Yeah, I know.

05:47.793 --> 05:50.206
Except she's Australian, so...

05:52.482 --> 05:54.482
Oh.

05:58.068 --> 05:59.793
I'm not sure
if you've noticed,

05:59.793 --> 06:01.241
but there's a US
nuclear submarine

06:01.241 --> 06:03.103
tied up a few hundred meters
from here.

06:03.103 --> 06:04.655
I did notice that, yes.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.103
First nuclear-powered warship

06:06.103 --> 06:07.862
in Sydney Harbour
in over 40 years.

06:07.862 --> 06:09.137
What would you call that?

06:09.137 --> 06:10.896
- Controversial.
- Overdue.

06:10.896 --> 06:13.275
Perhaps we could agree
on 'momentous', hm?

06:13.275 --> 06:16.379
Trouble is all anyone's
talking about is this.

06:16.379 --> 06:18.689
We've spent years
negotiating this,

06:18.689 --> 06:20.103
so to read 'AUKUS'

06:20.103 --> 06:22.724
and 'Dead in the Water'
in the same sentence...

06:22.724 --> 06:25.448
That's why a public display
of unity is essential.

06:26.413 --> 06:28.310
I've spoken
with the US ambassador

06:28.310 --> 06:31.379
and we've agreed on an
extraordinary NCIS investigation

06:31.379 --> 06:33.172
into Petty Officer
Flynn's death.

06:33.172 --> 06:36.344
I'm sorry. NCIS investigation?

06:36.344 --> 06:38.379
Agent Mackey
will lead the team

06:38.379 --> 06:40.413
and you'll provide
the AFP's full resources

06:40.413 --> 06:41.827
to help her get it done.

06:41.827 --> 06:45.137
With all due
respect, ma'am...

06:45.137 --> 06:46.413
...this is our turf.

06:46.413 --> 06:47.965
We should be the ones
running the...

06:47.965 --> 06:49.724
The decision's already
been made, Sergeant,

06:49.724 --> 06:51.965
well north of your pay grade.

06:52.931 --> 06:54.172
Are we clear?

06:54.172 --> 06:56.931
- Crystal, ma'am.
- Yeah.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.758
Sorry you had to
go through that.

07:00.758 --> 07:02.448
I'm not so sure you are.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.344
Are we gonna have
a problem here?

07:05.344 --> 07:06.689
God, no.

07:07.517 --> 07:09.862
See, I partner with visiting
American law enforcement

07:09.862 --> 07:12.034
for a living, Agent Mackey.

07:12.034 --> 07:14.413
So if the bigwigs reckon
it'll make better headlines

07:14.413 --> 07:16.586
if NCIS run the show
on this one,

07:16.586 --> 07:19.068
then who am I to argue, right?

07:19.068 --> 07:22.931
Funny, I thought that's
exactly what you were arguing.

07:22.931 --> 07:24.655
No, no, I get the optics.

07:24.655 --> 07:26.172
You know, there's me

07:26.172 --> 07:29.655
and then there's you with your
matching NCIS cap and T-shirt.

07:29.655 --> 07:31.827
See, I came here in a Kia,

07:31.827 --> 07:34.103
you came here in that.

07:34.103 --> 07:36.344
So what do you say
we wrap this thing up

07:36.344 --> 07:39.482
and get you back to your little
boat as soon as possible, huh?

07:39.482 --> 07:42.068
A submarine's
a 'boat', Sergeant.

07:42.068 --> 07:44.724
An aircraft carrier is a 'ship'.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.137
Whatever you say, Captain.

07:48.137 --> 07:51.310
Oh, and, um,
just so we're clear too,

07:51.310 --> 07:53.000
seeing as though
you can't wear a badge

07:53.000 --> 07:54.965
or carry a gun in this country,

07:54.965 --> 07:56.827
when it comes to doing
any actual police work,

07:56.827 --> 07:59.379
you just let me know, yeah?

07:59.379 --> 08:01.000
I'm all yours.

08:12.965 --> 08:15.103
- You do that every time?
- That's how we roll.

08:15.103 --> 08:19.827
Cruise into a port, get it done,
boom, on to the next one.

08:19.827 --> 08:21.827
- Sounds like my last boyfriend.
- What?

08:21.827 --> 08:24.379
Actually, come to think of it,
sounds more like me.

08:25.965 --> 08:28.620
Hey, how'd you go, boss?
Straighten things out?

08:28.620 --> 08:30.103
Sure did.

08:30.103 --> 08:31.896
The NCIS is gonna run the show

08:31.896 --> 08:34.586
and we're gonna do whatever we
can to wrap it up quick sticks.

08:34.586 --> 08:37.896
One team, one dream, y'all.
Love that.

08:37.896 --> 08:39.344
Alright,
let's get to it.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.068
What do we know about
Petty Officer Flynn?

08:41.068 --> 08:44.344
Right, so Petty Officer
2nd Class Eric Flynn -

08:44.344 --> 08:47.000
27, born and raised
in Corpus Christi, Texas.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.103
Six years in the navy,
last four on subs.

08:49.103 --> 08:50.655
Recruitment profile
said he joined up

08:50.655 --> 08:52.034
in lieu of doing a stretch.

08:52.034 --> 08:54.896
Seemed he liked a drink and
the bar fight that came with it.

08:54.896 --> 08:57.034
Is there a significant
other we need to inform?

08:57.034 --> 08:58.206
Apparently not.

08:58.206 --> 08:59.931
Flynn was single
and ready to mingle

08:59.931 --> 09:01.482
according to the shipmates
we spoke to.

09:01.482 --> 09:03.413
He sure was.

09:04.241 --> 09:07.862
Sorry. I had a sneak peek
at Mr Flynn's profile.

09:07.862 --> 09:09.827
- Sorry. Was I supposed to wait?
- No.

09:09.827 --> 09:12.448
Never say sorry. Better to ask
forgiveness than permission.

09:12.448 --> 09:14.000
Okay, right, sorry.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.413
Sorry, that was...

09:15.413 --> 09:19.310
So apparently he had a hot date
in the Rocks last night.

09:19.310 --> 09:21.827
Can you get me an ID
and address for this Xena?

09:21.827 --> 09:26.172
Just... I'm gonna have to hack
her profile to get that.

09:26.172 --> 09:27.827
So just wondering
if there's, like,

09:27.827 --> 09:30.068
a privacy angle
that I need to consider.

09:30.068 --> 09:33.310
Absolutely. Hack it,
then keep it private.

09:37.172 --> 09:38.551
So your boss,

09:38.551 --> 09:40.965
not exactly the warm
and cuddly type, huh?

09:42.172 --> 09:44.103
She can come in
a little hot, can't she?

09:44.103 --> 09:45.517
But she's good people, you know?

09:45.517 --> 09:47.724
It just takes a little
getting used to, is all.

09:47.724 --> 09:49.172
- How long did it take you?
- Ooft!

09:49.172 --> 09:51.206
We met when I was with
the JAG Corps.

09:51.206 --> 09:53.413
- Mackey was JAG?
- Oh, God, no!

09:53.413 --> 09:55.344
We were court martialing her.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.724
What did she do?

09:56.724 --> 09:58.172
See, that's a Mackey question.

09:58.172 --> 10:00.379
Oh, come on! I won't tell.

10:00.379 --> 10:02.344
Mn-mn! It's not for me to say.

10:02.344 --> 10:04.931
But what I can say
is she was found not guilty.

10:04.931 --> 10:06.206
Look, I won't lie.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.620
Mackey doesn't always
play well with others.

10:07.620 --> 10:09.482
What? You're only
working that out now?

10:09.482 --> 10:11.000
But she cares, you know?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.655
And when she likes you,
hoo-whee, look out, baby.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.172
That's it. You're all hers.

10:15.172 --> 10:17.206
I can't tell if that's
a promise or a threat.

10:17.206 --> 10:19.620
There you go. You're starting
to get her already.

10:20.655 --> 10:24.586
Damn! And there she is,
'Bondy' Beach.

10:24.586 --> 10:26.000
'Bondi'.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.793
Ooh, hello!

10:29.620 --> 10:31.413
I can see what
all the fuss is about.

10:31.413 --> 10:34.724
Trust me, it'd be twice as good
with half the wankers.

10:34.724 --> 10:36.137
Wait. What?

10:38.310 --> 10:41.172
Hey there.
Special Agent Jackson, NCIS.

10:41.172 --> 10:43.758
You certainly are.

10:43.758 --> 10:46.275
- Uh...
- Constable Evie Cooper, AFP.

10:46.275 --> 10:47.689
We're looking for Xena.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.344
Xena Phobia at your service.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.965
Why would somebody do this?

10:56.965 --> 10:58.379
Easier to hack a real profile

10:58.379 --> 11:00.103
than to build one
from scratch, I guess.

11:00.103 --> 11:01.517
It's a real
violation, I know.

11:01.517 --> 11:04.724
I don't care about that.
It's just so tacky.

11:04.724 --> 11:06.896
Honestly, if you're gonna
hack a girl's dating profile,

11:06.896 --> 11:08.379
at least improve it.

11:08.379 --> 11:10.689
To be clear, then,
you weren't on a date

11:10.689 --> 11:12.517
with an American sailor
at the Rocks last night?

11:12.517 --> 11:15.034
Afraid not, honey.
Back-to-back shows.

11:15.034 --> 11:18.379
But I am wide open tonight.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.344
I'm afraid I gotta,
you know, take a rain check.

11:22.344 --> 11:24.448
You know where to find me.

11:24.448 --> 11:25.896
Of course.

11:25.896 --> 11:29.793
In here.
Yeah, obviously.

11:31.965 --> 11:33.655
White blood count
looks low. Huh.

11:33.655 --> 11:36.344
Could be hepatitis.

11:38.172 --> 11:39.758
So what you thinking?

11:39.758 --> 11:41.344
What do you know
about blood count?

11:41.344 --> 11:44.103
JD said your PhD
was in quantum computing.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.482
It is.
Well, it was my first one.

11:46.482 --> 11:48.517
I've got three different supervisors

11:48.517 --> 11:52.137
in three different departments
across three unis, so shh!

11:52.137 --> 11:55.137
You're doing a second PhD?

11:56.068 --> 11:57.689
- You are?
- Yes.

11:57.689 --> 12:00.103
You're barely old enough
to vote. How's that possible?

12:00.103 --> 12:05.275
I don't know. I just...
I got my nerd on early, I guess.

12:06.551 --> 12:09.241
Look, I know it's only
temporary, me being here,

12:09.241 --> 12:11.137
but thank you
for letting me hang.

12:11.137 --> 12:14.310
No, no, no. None of that.
I wasn't aware I had a choice.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.241
Yeah, I remember him.

12:18.241 --> 12:19.655
He was playing pool
with some blonde

12:19.655 --> 12:21.793
in the downstairs bar
when the trouble happened.

12:21.793 --> 12:23.068
What kind of trouble?

12:23.068 --> 12:24.517
Couple of blokes
got stuck into him

12:24.517 --> 12:26.448
as soon as they heard
he was a septic.

12:26.448 --> 12:29.482
- Wait. He was septic?
- 'Septic'.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.931
'Septic tank'. 'Yank'.

12:30.931 --> 12:32.310
You get used to it.

12:32.310 --> 12:34.620
Once they worked out
he was off that American sub,

12:34.620 --> 12:36.482
they're really got stuck in.

12:40.689 --> 12:42.517
True to form, huh?

12:43.689 --> 12:46.379
So I got
the CCTV footage from the bar.

12:46.379 --> 12:47.655
With facial rec,

12:47.655 --> 12:49.965
they make sure the
over-the-counter version sucks

12:49.965 --> 12:51.551
so no one gets too freaked out,

12:51.551 --> 12:55.344
but the military's version
is bananas.

12:57.965 --> 13:01.379
Um... I didn't think
we had this stuff.

13:01.379 --> 13:04.034
We don't. It's not our military.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.000
What?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.068
Boss lady told me
to swing for the fences.

13:09.068 --> 13:11.000
Yeah, boss lady's outward bound

13:11.000 --> 13:12.827
on a ship for Tokyo next week.

13:12.827 --> 13:14.655
You're not. Be careful.

13:18.689 --> 13:20.655
Whoops!

13:30.758 --> 13:32.620
Is it always like this?

13:32.620 --> 13:34.931
Oh, what? You don't have
traffic where you're from?

13:34.931 --> 13:37.103
I'm from Winthrop, Iowa.

13:37.103 --> 13:39.068
They've been threatening
to put a traffic light in

13:39.068 --> 13:40.655
since I was a baby.

13:40.655 --> 13:42.965
So there you go -
I knew we were gonna find

13:42.965 --> 13:44.586
some common ground
sooner or later.

13:44.586 --> 13:45.758
I'm from the bush too,

13:45.758 --> 13:48.793
the little town
of Gumly Gumly outside of Wagga.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.931
- Wagga?
- Well, Wagga Wagga, actually.

13:52.931 --> 13:55.310
"Gumly Gumly just outside
Wagga Wagga"?

13:55.310 --> 13:57.620
- That's the one.
- You expect me to believe that?

13:57.620 --> 13:59.965
Hey, at least we got
traffic lights, mate.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.931
Really?
Come on, mate. Let's go.

14:01.931 --> 14:04.827
So... folks on the land too?

14:04.827 --> 14:06.413
Crop-dusting business.

14:06.413 --> 14:10.000
Ah. Okay, hence
the love of flying.

14:11.034 --> 14:14.482
Except my brothers
got dibs on the plane.

14:14.482 --> 14:17.517
So... joined the marines,

14:17.517 --> 14:19.551
learned to fly
combat choppers instead.

14:19.551 --> 14:21.448
Hm, okay.

14:21.448 --> 14:24.103
Never liked being told
how low I could fly anyway.

14:24.103 --> 14:25.793
Funny that.

14:27.965 --> 14:29.689
Oh, heads up.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.517
Oh, that's him, right? Let's go.

14:34.517 --> 14:36.344
Hey, steady on.
Police work's on me, remember?

14:36.344 --> 14:40.000
You just sit back, enjoy
the show, maybe take some notes.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.034
Hey, AFP. Stop right there.

14:44.034 --> 14:45.655
Oh, okay.

14:52.344 --> 14:55.068
Come here! Hey, come here!

14:55.068 --> 14:57.000
Come on! I can do this all day!

14:58.724 --> 15:00.241
Huh!

15:03.034 --> 15:04.551
Hey, come on!

15:04.551 --> 15:07.689
Ugh!

15:09.862 --> 15:11.275
Huh!

15:14.448 --> 15:16.413
Thought I told you to stay put.

15:16.413 --> 15:19.000
Got bored. Sue me.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.172
You don't look
too flustered.

15:28.172 --> 15:30.344
I'm an activist.
Cops harass me all the time.

15:30.344 --> 15:32.655
My partner did
more than harass you, mate.

15:32.655 --> 15:34.241
She folded you like a deckchair.

15:34.241 --> 15:35.344
Whatever, figured you'd be

15:35.344 --> 15:36.689
banging on my door
after what happened.

15:36.689 --> 15:39.172
- So you admit you did it, then?
- Bloody oath!

15:39.172 --> 15:40.896
I'm proud of it too.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.793
People need to know the dangers

15:42.793 --> 15:44.827
of those nuclear subs
in the harbor.

15:44.827 --> 15:47.379
Hm, and you wanted
to do that by what?

15:47.379 --> 15:49.482
Kill a US submariner?
Is that it?

15:50.758 --> 15:52.620
What? What are you
talking about?

15:52.620 --> 15:53.896
What are you talking about?

15:53.896 --> 15:55.965
The anti-nuke banner
at the AUKUS ceremony.

15:55.965 --> 15:59.172
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Really? Oh.

16:00.517 --> 16:02.517
This is you, isn't it?

16:07.172 --> 16:08.517
- No?
- No, no.

16:08.517 --> 16:10.137
We got into a little
push-and-shove.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.689
It's not my fault some loudmouth
Yank can't take a punch.

16:12.689 --> 16:13.931
I barely hit the bloke.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.206
And yet there he is,

16:15.206 --> 16:17.034
lying on a slab
in the next room.

16:17.034 --> 16:20.137
And once we prove you hacked
Xena's dating profile

16:20.137 --> 16:22.448
to lure him out, we got you
on premeditation as well.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.379
This is insane!
It was nothing. He walked away!

16:25.379 --> 16:27.724
I've got the footage
to prove it. Give me my phone.

16:27.724 --> 16:29.517
Give me my phone!

16:34.275 --> 16:37.103
My mate filmed it
in case security got heavy.

16:38.172 --> 16:40.758
See? He walks away. He's fine.

16:40.758 --> 16:43.000
Whoa, whoa. Pause it there.

16:44.413 --> 16:46.000
Is that Xena?

16:46.931 --> 16:49.137
This your little
blonde honey trap?

16:49.137 --> 16:51.310
She was with the Americans,
nothing to do with me.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.517
You can let this bloke go.

16:53.517 --> 16:55.586
Yeah, I don't think so.

16:55.586 --> 16:58.137
- He's not our guy.
- What?

17:01.379 --> 17:03.896
Flynn was dead no matter
what happened in that fight.

17:03.896 --> 17:05.931
How can you be so sure?

17:05.931 --> 17:08.000
Because he's radioactive.

17:17.758 --> 17:19.137
All US personnel...

17:19.137 --> 17:21.620
And you're sure we can't
just tow it back out to sea?

17:21.620 --> 17:23.241
That is a $5 billion

17:23.241 --> 17:24.931
state-of-the-art
warship, Sergeant.

17:24.931 --> 17:26.413
Yeah, that's leaking
its state-of-the-art

17:26.413 --> 17:28.344
radioactive waste
into Sydney Harbour.

17:28.344 --> 17:30.413
How long till we can get
eyes on board?

17:30.413 --> 17:31.827
There's a specialist NAVSEA team

17:31.827 --> 17:33.344
en route from San Diego
as we speak.

17:33.344 --> 17:35.620
That's it?
There's no one closer?

17:35.620 --> 17:37.241
Nuclear propulsion
is the most closely guarded

17:37.241 --> 17:38.655
secret in the US Navy.

17:38.655 --> 17:41.413
Not everyone gets to pop the
hood on one of those bad boys.

17:41.413 --> 17:44.379
I hope there's still a hood to
pop by the time they get here.

17:44.379 --> 17:45.724
Relax.

17:45.724 --> 17:47.137
We have used nuclear warships

17:47.137 --> 17:49.724
for the last 70 years
without incident.

17:49.724 --> 17:51.275
They don't break. Trust me.

17:51.275 --> 17:53.068
Oh, how do you know?

17:53.068 --> 17:55.241
Most closely guarded secret
in the navy.

17:56.344 --> 17:57.793
This is JD.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.275
They what?

18:00.275 --> 18:01.827
They just rocked up
and grabbed him

18:01.827 --> 18:03.482
halfway through the autopsy.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.655
Colonel Richard Rankin,
DOD Attaché.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.137
Friend of yours?

18:07.137 --> 18:08.655
Never met him before.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.482
And this bloke,
he's got the authority

18:10.482 --> 18:12.517
to come in here and grab
Flynn's body like that?

18:12.517 --> 18:15.068
In theory.
Rankin's DOD, Flynn was Navy.

18:15.068 --> 18:17.103
Still, I would've expected
a little heads-up.

18:17.103 --> 18:19.482
Yeah, you know
how this looks, right?

18:19.482 --> 18:21.655
An irradiated sailor
from a nuclear sub disappears.

18:21.655 --> 18:22.793
Sergeant...

18:22.793 --> 18:24.206
Rankin's trying
to bury the evidence

18:24.206 --> 18:25.724
to make sure nothing
disrupts the AUKUS deal.

18:25.724 --> 18:28.275
- I get it. I'll talk to him.
- Great. Let me know when.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.275
Due respect, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.689
With all due respect, I don't
care! This is my harbor.

18:32.689 --> 18:34.172
And this is my investigation.

18:34.172 --> 18:36.620
We can, um,
totally do this later.

18:36.620 --> 18:37.758
100%.

18:37.758 --> 18:39.344
Or we can do it now.

18:39.344 --> 18:41.586
- Yep.
- Sure thing. No problemo.

18:41.586 --> 18:43.344
So, uh, we just came back

18:43.344 --> 18:45.275
from where the 'Navajo' crew
are quarantining

18:45.275 --> 18:46.689
until they test negative
for radiation.

18:46.689 --> 18:49.241
- Well, most of them anyway.
- Most of them are testing?

18:49.241 --> 18:50.448
Most of them were there.

18:50.448 --> 18:52.172
One failed
to muster this morning.

18:52.172 --> 18:55.206
Lieutenant O'Leary.
Left base same time as Flynn.

18:55.206 --> 18:57.413
- Never returned.
- You're kidding me.

18:57.413 --> 18:59.517
Two submariners
from the same ship?

18:59.517 --> 19:01.241
- 'Boat'.
- 'Boat'.

19:02.448 --> 19:06.482
And what are the chances O'Leary
is radioactive as well, huh?

19:06.482 --> 19:09.206
Well, if he is, the next
24 hours is gonna be critical.

19:09.206 --> 19:10.724
After that,
we can't do much for him.

19:10.724 --> 19:13.620
Unless he's already dead in
a ditch somewhere as we speak.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.620
If that's the case,
then the least we can do is...

19:16.620 --> 19:18.620
...spell his name correctly.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.689
- Pull his file.
- We did.

19:20.689 --> 19:22.517
You're not gonna like it.

19:24.758 --> 19:26.724
Right.

19:26.724 --> 19:28.689
- I want his phone.
- It's off.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.310
- Credit card?
- Got it, boss.

19:30.310 --> 19:32.379
Put out a city-wide BOLO -

19:32.379 --> 19:35.172
hotels, hospitals,
halfway houses.

19:35.172 --> 19:37.206
The clock is ticking, people.

19:42.344 --> 19:45.896
Hey, who's the old dude?

19:45.896 --> 19:48.068
Bob Hawke -
the last of Australia's

19:48.068 --> 19:49.758
larrikin prime ministers, apparently.

19:49.758 --> 19:53.482
He held the world record for the
fastest yard of beer ever drunk.

19:53.482 --> 19:55.965
Wait. Hold on. You guys
measure your beer by the yard?

19:55.965 --> 19:58.379
- Do I look like I drink beer?
- Man!

19:58.379 --> 20:00.068
You know, we do
presidential libraries.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.379
You guys do
prime ministerial bars.

20:02.379 --> 20:03.620
That's dope.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.068
Sorry about the mess.

20:05.068 --> 20:06.517
Big function last night.

20:06.517 --> 20:09.068
Who knew craft brewers
were so into dress-ups?

20:09.068 --> 20:10.482
I love craft brewing.

20:10.482 --> 20:13.137
And dress-ups,
come to think of it. Rawr!

20:13.137 --> 20:15.172
Are you done?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.827
- Constable Evie Cooper.
- Special Agent DeShawn Jackson.

20:18.827 --> 20:20.551
- NCIS...
- AFP...

20:21.379 --> 20:24.137
AFP. We're Looking for this guy.

20:24.137 --> 20:25.551
Last known use
of his credit card

20:25.551 --> 20:27.379
was in here
around 9pm last night.

20:27.379 --> 20:30.379
Oh, yeah, yeah, he was here.
You couldn't miss him. Huh!

20:30.379 --> 20:32.000
Schlubby-looking dude walks in.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.896
A minute later, the fittest
woman in the joint's

20:33.896 --> 20:35.310
all over him like a rash.

20:35.310 --> 20:37.172
- Look like they knew each other?
- Not at all.

20:37.172 --> 20:39.275
She just beelined for him
as soon as he arrived.

20:39.275 --> 20:40.689
Can you describe her?

20:40.689 --> 20:44.068
Um, yeah, she was hot,
but in a kind of...

20:44.068 --> 20:46.275
...a Eurotrash kind of way.

20:47.103 --> 20:50.206
Blonde and, um, stacked.

20:50.206 --> 20:52.620
We're gonna need to see
your security footage

20:52.620 --> 20:54.068
of the function.

20:54.068 --> 20:55.965
No can do, comrade.

20:55.965 --> 20:59.000
Trust me, comrade,
you don't wanna do that.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.827
I'll just come back
with a warrant,

21:00.827 --> 21:02.172
a health inspector if I have to.

21:02.172 --> 21:03.310
No, it's not that.

21:03.310 --> 21:05.448
It's just that
we don't do surveillance.

21:05.448 --> 21:08.413
Bob Hawke wasn't big on spies.

21:27.206 --> 21:29.793
Special Agent Mackey,
Colonel Richard Rankin.

21:29.793 --> 21:32.517
Good to meet you.
Heard great things.

21:32.517 --> 21:35.689
And you're already lying to me.
Not a good start, Colonel.

21:35.689 --> 21:37.482
Oh, just trying to be polite.

21:37.482 --> 21:40.689
I don't need polite. I need
Petty Officer Flynn back.

21:40.689 --> 21:42.965
I'm afraid
that's out of my hands.

21:42.965 --> 21:44.241
What do you mean?

21:44.241 --> 21:45.793
The Prime Minister's
been briefed.

21:45.793 --> 21:47.793
He's keen to keep it
under wraps.

21:47.793 --> 21:49.241
And how do we do that?

21:49.241 --> 21:51.137
The sub's docked in
the middle of Sydney Harbour.

21:51.137 --> 21:53.241
Rest assured,
the PM's acutely aware

21:53.241 --> 21:55.448
of the sensitivities
around that.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.827
You mean he's playing nice
for our American overlords?

21:57.827 --> 21:59.551
Sergeant, you're out of line.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.413
Out of line? Like snatching
a body mid-autopsy?

22:02.413 --> 22:04.310
This is an ongoing investigation.

22:04.310 --> 22:06.068
You already solved it,
Agent Mackey.

22:06.068 --> 22:07.793
The man died
of radiation exposure.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.206
From what?
Those reactors don't fail.

22:10.206 --> 22:11.758
You know as well as I do.

22:11.758 --> 22:13.241
You're an investigator.
I get it.

22:13.241 --> 22:14.793
But in this instance,
you're seeing things

22:14.793 --> 22:15.965
that just aren't there.

22:15.965 --> 22:17.896
Like Flynn's body?

22:17.896 --> 22:20.310
Or Lieutenant O'Leary's
service file?

22:20.310 --> 22:23.586
You want answers. I get it.

22:23.586 --> 22:25.517
But our relationship
with the Americans

22:25.517 --> 22:27.482
has dimensions I can't
expect you to understand.

22:27.482 --> 22:29.310
Still, how am I
supposed to do my job

22:29.310 --> 22:30.655
if I'm being kept in the dark?

22:30.655 --> 22:34.000
Experienced campaigner,
I'm sure you'll find a way.

22:35.137 --> 22:36.793
Like I said,
I did a little digging

22:36.793 --> 22:38.275
into you, Special Agent Mackey.

22:38.275 --> 22:39.620
And?

22:39.620 --> 22:43.103
And it's clear you barely
survived that court martial.

22:43.103 --> 22:45.137
You don't know
the first thing about me.

22:45.137 --> 22:48.655
Well, I know the Marine Corps
tried to end you

22:48.655 --> 22:50.344
and there's folks out there

22:50.344 --> 22:54.379
looking for any excuse
to finish what they started.

22:54.379 --> 22:56.344
I spoke
to your boss, by the way.

22:56.344 --> 23:00.206
He's a fan. Earmarked you
for big things down the track.

23:00.206 --> 23:02.172
You just have to get there.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.965
Just find O'Leary and call me.

23:06.965 --> 23:09.379
The rest will
take care of itself.

23:15.965 --> 23:18.310
How'd you go with Rankin?

23:19.137 --> 23:20.517
Oh, that good, huh?

23:20.517 --> 23:23.931
Told me to play nice or I can
kiss my career goodbye. You?

23:23.931 --> 23:27.034
Same. Like they compared notes.

23:27.034 --> 23:28.827
Don't know if that
makes me feel better

23:28.827 --> 23:30.379
or a whole lot worse.

23:30.379 --> 23:31.862
Mmm.

23:38.413 --> 23:40.206
Does finding O'Leary
count as playing nice?

23:42.517 --> 23:44.517
Room 28, second floor.

23:44.517 --> 23:48.000
The owner confirmed O'Leary
checked in with a lady friend,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.931
but without an apostrophe
in his last name.

23:49.931 --> 23:50.931
Go, Rosie.

23:50.931 --> 23:52.068
I knew that sour sonofabitch

23:52.068 --> 23:53.482
would come in handy
at some point.

23:53.482 --> 23:55.620
- I'll tell him you said that.
- What?

23:55.620 --> 23:58.137
We could open that door and
find him glowing in a bathtub.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.931
Or he's just
making up for months

23:59.931 --> 24:02.034
trapped in a tin can
with a bunch of blokes.

24:02.034 --> 24:03.586
Either way, I'm not taking...

24:12.793 --> 24:14.551
Here.

24:16.103 --> 24:19.206
Lieutenant O'Leary,
I'm Special Agent Mackey, NCIS.

24:19.206 --> 24:20.827
This is Sergeant
Jim Dempsey, AFP.

24:20.827 --> 24:24.034
We are coming in. I want to
see your hands. You understand?

24:48.275 --> 24:50.448
- What are you thinking, Rosie?
- I'm thinking it's 3am.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.517
I shouldn't have answered the
bloody phone, but that helps.

24:52.517 --> 24:54.241
Still,
seeing as you're here?

24:54.241 --> 24:56.137
Well...
...he's not radioactive.

24:56.137 --> 24:58.448
- So that's something.
- Yeah.

24:58.448 --> 25:00.689
Cause of death's a 9mm round,

25:00.689 --> 25:02.793
entered just below his mandible,

25:02.793 --> 25:05.551
exit north of
his occipital lobe.

25:05.551 --> 25:06.689
Self-inflicted?

25:06.689 --> 25:07.965
Ah, hard to say

25:07.965 --> 25:09.413
till I check for
ballistics residue,

25:09.413 --> 25:12.310
but I do have
a dead bloke with a gun

25:12.310 --> 25:14.862
and a 'farewell, cruel world'
note.

25:14.862 --> 25:17.551
- Paints a picture.
- That's what I'm worried about.

25:17.551 --> 25:20.068
Undisturbed 24 hours
after check-in.

25:20.068 --> 25:21.689
That's a lot of foreplay.

25:22.517 --> 25:25.137
Bathroom window's open.
Screen's pushed out.

25:25.137 --> 25:26.482
And there's that.

25:26.482 --> 25:29.137
"We are what we do,
but I didn't do enough."

25:29.137 --> 25:31.137
It's a bit poetic for
a suicide note, isn't it?

25:31.137 --> 25:32.551
Yeah, the whole thing
feels staged.

25:32.551 --> 25:34.413
Didn't need that
on an empty stomach.

25:35.379 --> 25:36.793
What have you got?

25:36.793 --> 25:38.137
So we tracked O'Leary

25:38.137 --> 25:39.620
to a cowboy-themed
craft brew meet-up.

25:39.620 --> 25:41.758
Where he hooked up with
a very attractive lady friend.

25:41.758 --> 25:43.103
Take a swing at her hair color.

25:43.103 --> 25:44.758
Why don't you
show me the footage

25:44.758 --> 25:45.793
and save me the suspense?

25:45.793 --> 25:47.482
I would,
but the ironic mustaches

25:47.482 --> 25:49.206
at the Bob Hawke
Beer and Leisure Centre

25:49.206 --> 25:50.724
don't believe in CCTV.

25:50.724 --> 25:52.413
They do, however,
believe in photo booths.

25:52.413 --> 25:54.413
And as luck would have it...

26:00.793 --> 26:02.689
First the dating app, now this.

26:02.689 --> 26:04.758
Is she sloppy or
is she messing with us?

26:04.758 --> 26:07.068
- Think she was here too?
- Sure like to ask her.

26:07.068 --> 26:08.862
And I'd sure like
to get Mr O'Leary

26:08.862 --> 26:10.275
back to my rooms
for the autopsy,

26:10.275 --> 26:11.827
if that's not too much to ask.

26:11.827 --> 26:13.103
We bring O'Leary back to base,

26:13.103 --> 26:14.862
they come snatch him too,
just like Flynn.

26:14.862 --> 26:16.827
No body, no fallout.

26:16.827 --> 26:18.655
Someone tell me I'm wrong.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.620
So, what if we don't
take him back?

26:28.551 --> 26:30.068
Ooh-hoo!

26:30.068 --> 26:31.724
How good is that?

26:31.724 --> 26:34.448
This place is crazy, Doc.
How'd you find it?

26:34.448 --> 26:36.310
You been around
as long as I have, son,

26:36.310 --> 26:38.103
you know where
all the secrets are.

26:38.103 --> 26:39.172
Damn straight.

26:39.172 --> 26:40.310
I used to come here

26:40.310 --> 26:41.896
every New Year's Eve
with my wife

26:41.896 --> 26:45.068
and we'd get a nice bottle of
plonk, treat ourselves to that

26:45.068 --> 26:47.172
and then we'd take in
the old fireworks.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.724
Yeah.

26:49.724 --> 26:51.482
Best seats in the house.

26:52.724 --> 26:55.965
Eternal rest
grant unto him, my Lord,

26:55.965 --> 26:58.448
and let perpetual light
shine upon him.

26:58.448 --> 27:02.137
May he rest in peace. Amen.

27:02.137 --> 27:04.000
You right?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.413
Sorry, sorry.

27:05.413 --> 27:07.379
It... The blood panels
are cooking.

27:07.379 --> 27:09.793
I'm just waiting
for the read-out.

27:09.793 --> 27:11.758
You know, I'm impressed.

27:11.758 --> 27:16.344
Not many people know
the Prayer of Eternal Rest.

27:17.655 --> 27:18.793
How'd you know?

27:18.793 --> 27:19.931
- How do I know?
- Yeah.

27:19.931 --> 27:23.344
I have been bloody
doing this for 40 years.

27:23.344 --> 27:27.103
You could say
my entire life is death. Hmph!

27:28.068 --> 27:29.448
More to the point...

27:31.655 --> 27:33.275
...how do you know?

27:35.275 --> 27:37.758
- TikTok.
- Good on you.

27:47.137 --> 27:50.241
How's that
for confidence-building?

27:51.137 --> 27:52.551
Gotta trust them
to stop a bullet,

27:52.551 --> 27:54.448
but whatever you do,
don't drop 'em.

27:54.448 --> 27:55.620
Uh-huh.

28:01.689 --> 28:03.482
Hey, you know, fun fact -

28:03.482 --> 28:06.827
Aussies survived
Japanese POW camps

28:06.827 --> 28:09.310
at higher rates
than any other nationalities.

28:09.310 --> 28:10.862
You need to sleep.

28:10.862 --> 28:12.931
- You know why?
- 'Cause you're delirious?

28:12.931 --> 28:14.517
'Cause we shared everything.

28:15.517 --> 28:17.689
Right down to
the last bowl of rice.

28:17.689 --> 28:21.103
Officers, grunts, didn't matter.

28:21.965 --> 28:23.689
We'll be fine.

28:24.689 --> 28:25.862
Hey, Jim, come here!

28:28.241 --> 28:30.275
- Check it again.
- What is it?

28:30.275 --> 28:32.758
Um, what's-it-called's got
something to show ya.

28:32.758 --> 28:34.965
Um, O'Leary's blood panel -

28:34.965 --> 28:37.000
confirmation
he's not radioactive,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.137
all totally normal, except that.

28:39.137 --> 28:41.172
Uh, what am I looking at?

28:41.172 --> 28:42.827
That spike is sodium pentothal.

28:42.827 --> 28:45.034
So he died from being shot up
by sodium pentothal?

28:45.034 --> 28:47.103
No, the small amount
in O'Leary's blood

28:47.103 --> 28:49.344
would actually have
some kind of euphoric effect.

28:49.344 --> 28:50.965
So he was getting high?

28:50.965 --> 28:53.241
If by 'high',
you mean a decrease

28:53.241 --> 28:54.655
in cortical brain function

28:54.655 --> 28:57.034
designed to encourage
a loss of inhibition...

28:57.034 --> 28:58.655
For the cheap seats, Blue?

28:58.655 --> 28:59.655
Heh!

28:59.655 --> 29:01.379
Um, so before he died from

29:01.379 --> 29:03.413
a gunshot wound to the head,

29:03.413 --> 29:06.000
it's likely that he was
shot up with a truth serum.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.344
Hm.

29:07.344 --> 29:09.206
O'Leary was a nuclear submariner

29:09.206 --> 29:11.034
with a sealed personnel file.

29:11.862 --> 29:14.965
Sounds to me like he might have
been keeping a secret or two.

29:14.965 --> 29:17.068
Just so I'm clear,
are we talking about

29:17.068 --> 29:19.379
a leaking nuclear sub
or leaking nuclear secrets?

29:19.379 --> 29:23.103
I don't know,
but I know someone who might.

29:24.172 --> 29:27.241
You're to report
to the carrier by 0900 hours.

29:27.241 --> 29:28.793
The Admiral takes a dim view

29:28.793 --> 29:32.137
of concealing dead sailors
from the chain of command.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.137
I've also spoken with AFP.

29:34.137 --> 29:35.586
Fair to say they're not thrilled

29:35.586 --> 29:37.310
with your part in this
whole fiasco either.

29:37.310 --> 29:40.931
Come again? One of your subs
has leaked into my harbor.

29:40.931 --> 29:42.448
But you seem a little
more interested

29:42.448 --> 29:44.965
in saving your own ass
than looking after your people.

29:44.965 --> 29:47.068
So you want to talk about
fiascos, Colonel?

29:47.068 --> 29:48.689
Expect a call from your boss.

29:48.689 --> 29:51.620
I'll deal with my boss when
I'm done with the investigation.

29:52.482 --> 29:54.724
There is no more investigation.

29:54.724 --> 29:58.034
The NAVSEA team are onboard
the 'Navajo' as we speak.

29:58.034 --> 29:59.724
They're reporting
elevated levels of radiation

29:59.724 --> 30:01.241
in the cooling system.

30:01.241 --> 30:02.827
So the reactor is leaking.

30:02.827 --> 30:05.310
Was. It was minor.

30:05.310 --> 30:07.137
Enough to kill Flynn.

30:07.137 --> 30:09.482
And O'Leary's guilt
at not discovering it sooner

30:09.482 --> 30:11.793
led him to take his own life.

30:12.793 --> 30:14.517
Why would O'Leary feel guilty?

30:14.517 --> 30:16.413
Because he worked
in the reactor room

30:16.413 --> 30:17.965
as part of the propulsion team,

30:17.965 --> 30:19.931
hence his classified access.

30:19.931 --> 30:22.068
That's why his file's
sealed, right?

30:23.448 --> 30:25.413
I need to speak with NAVSEA.

30:25.413 --> 30:27.379
You're not speaking with anyone.

30:28.206 --> 30:30.206
You're both so keen
to one-up each other,

30:30.206 --> 30:32.448
you invented a crime
that never existed.

30:32.448 --> 30:34.724
It's over...

30:34.724 --> 30:37.034
...much like your careers.

30:42.551 --> 30:44.275
You need to see this.

30:46.448 --> 30:48.137
Go on. You're on.

30:48.137 --> 30:50.551
- You tell them what you found.
- Okay.

30:50.551 --> 30:54.103
So I was cleaning up
after they took Mr Flynn's body

30:54.103 --> 30:56.206
and I found clumps of hair
on the ground.

30:56.206 --> 30:58.793
- Flynn's hair.
- Flynn's hair on the ground.

30:58.793 --> 31:00.862
I don't understand. I thought
he lost it in the fight.

31:00.862 --> 31:03.655
So did I, but turns out it was
because of radiation exposure,

31:03.655 --> 31:05.931
but it kept on falling out postmortem.

31:05.931 --> 31:07.965
Okay, either way,
how is this news?

31:07.965 --> 31:09.827
We already knew
he was irradiated.

31:09.827 --> 31:11.241
Well, I...

31:11.241 --> 31:13.275
...I analyzed
the hair follicle sample

31:13.275 --> 31:14.689
and the results just came in.

31:14.689 --> 31:17.103
Let me guess - Flynn didn't die
from radiation poisoning

31:17.103 --> 31:18.827
and we've all got
egg on our faces?

31:18.827 --> 31:21.586
No, he... he did,
just not from radium

31:21.586 --> 31:24.206
like you would expect
from a leaky reactor.

31:24.206 --> 31:26.862
So according to his hair sample,

31:26.862 --> 31:29.689
he died from exposure
to polonium-210.

31:30.517 --> 31:32.000
Polonium's
that radioactive isotope

31:32.000 --> 31:34.034
the FSB used to
kill that guy in London.

31:34.965 --> 31:36.655
We need to let JOC know.

31:36.655 --> 31:38.103
Know what?

31:38.103 --> 31:39.517
That we suspect
the Russians poisoned Flynn

31:39.517 --> 31:41.068
and emptied the 'Navajo'
of her crew,

31:41.068 --> 31:43.034
then tortured O'Leary
to steal nuclear secrets?

31:43.034 --> 31:45.275
- That's insane!
- Yeah, is it, though?

31:45.275 --> 31:47.862
I mean, we found polonium,
NAVSEA found radium.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.103
Someone's got it wrong.

31:49.103 --> 31:50.620
And just for the record,
it wasn't me.

31:50.620 --> 31:52.758
Which means either
NAVSEA is lying...

31:52.758 --> 31:54.344
Or Rankin's not
playing straight.

31:54.344 --> 31:57.551
- Mm.
- One way to find out.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.206
What? No, no, no.
Hey, hey. Listen.

32:00.206 --> 32:02.034
We'd have to break in.

32:02.034 --> 32:03.896
We've got zero authority anymore.

32:03.896 --> 32:05.586
Then we got nothing to lose.

32:07.068 --> 32:17.862
Come on, Sarge. Live a little.

32:27.724 --> 32:29.689
Special Agent
Michelle Mackey, NCIS.

32:29.689 --> 32:32.310
- Where's the rest of your team?
- I'm it, ma'am.

32:32.310 --> 32:34.655
We're on skeleton crew
on account of, you know...

32:34.655 --> 32:35.862
Sure, this won't take long.

32:35.862 --> 32:38.000
Ma'am, I'm under orders

32:38.000 --> 32:39.655
not to let anyone
inside the wire

32:39.655 --> 32:41.241
until the NAVSEA team's
cleared the vessel.

32:41.241 --> 32:42.724
That's why we're here.

32:42.724 --> 32:44.827
They found traces of radiation
in the coolant system.

32:44.827 --> 32:46.931
We have orders from JOC
to verify the readings.

32:46.931 --> 32:50.034
Uh, I haven't received
any operational update, ma'am.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.000
Till I do, I can't let you pass.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.827
Your funeral, son.

32:54.862 --> 32:56.241
Admiral Phillips, please.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.241
Special Agent Mackey, NCIS.

32:59.241 --> 33:00.931
Agent Mackey, sir.

33:00.931 --> 33:03.793
I'm here with
Petty Officer... Tan.

33:03.793 --> 33:06.448
No, sir, we're still shipside.

33:06.448 --> 33:09.310
Seems to be an issue
with access.

33:11.034 --> 33:12.862
Yes, sir.

33:14.103 --> 33:16.482
Petty Officer Tan, sir.

33:16.482 --> 33:18.689
Now, son, you
are going to let them through

33:18.689 --> 33:20.655
or that strange sensation
you're gonna be feeling

33:20.655 --> 33:21.896
in the seat of your pants

33:21.896 --> 33:24.413
will be my boot up your ass!

33:24.413 --> 33:27.103
You'll be cleaning latrines
in Gitmo within a week!

33:27.103 --> 33:28.896
- Yes, sir.
- You like that?

33:28.896 --> 33:31.310
- Join the damned Air Force!
- I understand, Admiral.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.620
- Understand?!
- Yes, sir.

33:39.310 --> 33:40.931
How's Doc's American accent?

33:40.931 --> 33:42.344
Pretty convincing, apparently.

33:42.344 --> 33:44.034
I guess you can add
ordering a subordinate

33:44.034 --> 33:46.068
to impersonate an admiral
to your charge sheet.

33:46.068 --> 33:47.620
As my dad used to say,

33:47.620 --> 33:49.827
"If two wrongs don't
make a right, try a third."

33:49.827 --> 33:51.655
Y'all can't be in here.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.655
The whole place
is a restricted zone.

33:53.655 --> 33:55.655
Yeah, I heard.

33:55.655 --> 33:57.689
Special Agent Mackey, NCIS.

33:57.689 --> 34:00.724
Lieutenant Commander Brandis,
NAVSEA San Diego.

34:00.724 --> 34:03.241
I'm afraid it's not safe
for you guys to be here.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.068
Why? Have you found something?

34:05.068 --> 34:06.862
'Cause, uh...

34:06.862 --> 34:08.965
...I'm getting nothing here.

34:08.965 --> 34:10.724
Mind if we take a look around?

34:10.724 --> 34:12.172
I do, ma'am.

34:12.172 --> 34:13.965
I have fleet-level orders
that give me

34:13.965 --> 34:15.586
operational control
of the situation.

34:15.586 --> 34:18.103
I can't let you
aboard that ship.

34:18.103 --> 34:19.620
Ship?

34:19.620 --> 34:22.137
I thought you navy guys
called it a 'boat'.

34:28.482 --> 34:30.827
Seems they have some
confusion over chain of command.

34:30.827 --> 34:32.448
It happens.
I understand.

34:32.448 --> 34:36.103
I have our orders right here.

34:44.137 --> 34:45.482
Everybody, move!

34:47.206 --> 34:50.137
Split up! Go, go, go! Move!

35:49.206 --> 35:50.655
Oh!

36:10.172 --> 36:12.689
- Put the gun down.
- I don't think so!

36:12.689 --> 36:15.689
Put your guns on the ground
or you leave me no choice.

36:15.689 --> 36:18.620
Evie, don't you dare!
I'm counting to three.

36:18.620 --> 36:22.379
One, two... three!

36:22.379 --> 36:23.655
Hey, asshole.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.310
Mackey! You okay? You okay?

36:42.310 --> 36:44.724
Hey, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

36:45.793 --> 36:48.275
Damn... Oh, you good?

36:51.275 --> 36:55.413
Oh! That was some shot, cowboy.

36:55.413 --> 36:57.103
You really are from the country.

36:57.103 --> 36:58.965
There's easier ways
to get me to prove it.

37:01.517 --> 37:03.206
You good?

37:07.103 --> 37:08.586
Oh!

37:23.275 --> 37:24.586
No! Hey!

37:24.586 --> 37:26.862
I'm guessing we need some kind
of clearance to do this.

37:26.862 --> 37:28.482
I'd have thought so.

37:39.034 --> 37:41.103
Hey, what the hell?!

37:56.379 --> 37:58.344
<i>Okay, I've got
eyes on. They're up ahead.</i>

37:58.344 --> 37:59.862
<i>They're heading for open sea.</i>

37:59.862 --> 38:02.896
<i>Yeah, don't worry.
I know. I got this.</i>

38:02.896 --> 38:04.482
<i>Pull up beside them.</i>

38:08.344 --> 38:10.896
<i>This is
NCIS Special Agent Mackey.</i>

38:10.896 --> 38:12.379
<i>Step away from the controls</i>

38:12.379 --> 38:14.689
<i>and raise your hands
so I can see them.</i>

38:17.241 --> 38:18.655
<i>They're not stopping, Mackey.</i>

38:21.896 --> 38:24.034
<i>They're gonna get away.</i>

38:24.034 --> 38:26.413
<i>- What now?
- Time to kick it up a notch.</i>

38:28.000 --> 38:29.482
<i>Gonna herd them back around.</i>

38:29.482 --> 38:31.206
<i>I see them down there.</i>

38:33.034 --> 38:34.517
<i>Come on!</i>

38:37.758 --> 38:39.241
<i>How do you like that?</i>

38:43.896 --> 38:46.862
<i>Back left, back left. Going
back left! Going back left!</i>

38:50.103 --> 38:51.758
<i>Alright, they're going
straight out. Let's go.</i>

38:51.758 --> 38:53.758
<i>Let's chase them,
let's chase them.</i>

39:00.068 --> 39:01.586
<i>Stay on them, stay on them.</i>

39:23.965 --> 39:26.724
<i>Investigators are
pointing to a ruptured fuel line</i>

39:26.724 --> 39:28.862
<i>as the cause of the fire
that claimed the lives</i>

39:28.862 --> 39:30.344
<i>of all three fishermen on board.</i>

39:30.344 --> 39:32.448
That's the best
they could come up with?

39:32.448 --> 39:33.827
A fishing accident?

39:33.827 --> 39:36.551
Oh, yeah, what did they
use as bait? Semtex?

39:36.551 --> 39:38.827
Come on.
Take the win, hey?

39:38.827 --> 39:41.586
It's much better
than the alternative.

39:41.586 --> 39:43.034
It's been real, yo.

39:43.034 --> 39:44.655
Good man.

39:45.620 --> 39:47.137
Tell you one thing -
as an office,

39:47.137 --> 39:49.068
this is gonna be
bloody hard to top.

39:52.896 --> 39:54.896
- Oh!
- Last one out, kill the lights.

39:56.275 --> 39:57.586
Alright.

39:57.586 --> 39:58.689
I get it.

39:58.689 --> 40:01.241
What are you gonna do
after they fire you?

40:02.206 --> 40:04.655
Go back to teaching, probably.
You?

40:04.655 --> 40:06.965
Haven't worked it out yet.

40:06.965 --> 40:09.724
Can you cropdust from a chopper?

40:10.724 --> 40:12.275
Come.

40:13.689 --> 40:17.827
All evidence points to
a sleeper cell going back years.

40:17.827 --> 40:19.620
They'd infiltrated NAVSEA

40:19.620 --> 40:23.137
with the sole aim of penetrating
America's nuclear secrets.

40:23.137 --> 40:25.448
Few will ever know
how close they got.

40:25.448 --> 40:27.413
Congratulations to you both.

40:28.758 --> 40:30.448
For what?

40:30.448 --> 40:33.206
This isn't over.
That boat was rigged to explode.

40:33.206 --> 40:34.689
Somebody didn't want their guys

40:34.689 --> 40:36.344
anywhere near
an interrogation room.

40:36.344 --> 40:38.344
- And what about the woman?
- No sign of her yet.

40:38.344 --> 40:40.862
- But still looking.
- Huh.

40:40.862 --> 40:43.310
Well, what if she wasn't
on the boat?

40:43.310 --> 40:45.379
<i>Then I expect that won't be</i>

40:45.379 --> 40:47.379
<i>the last time that
we hear from her.</i>

40:48.655 --> 40:52.310
<i>Special Agent Mackey,
you look a little shocked.</i>

40:52.310 --> 40:56.931
Sir, uh, I just didn't expect
to be fired by the boss, is all.

40:56.931 --> 40:59.586
I figured you had people
for that.

40:59.586 --> 41:02.620
<i>Oh, I do.
I'm not here to fire you.</i>

41:02.620 --> 41:04.517
<i>Not today at least.</i>

41:05.344 --> 41:07.137
<i>Ken Carter,
Special Agent in Charge,</i>

41:07.137 --> 41:10.862
<i>NCIS Field Office
Southeast Asia, Singapore.</i>

41:10.862 --> 41:13.034
<i>I want to thank you
for hosting us, Sergeant.</i>

41:13.034 --> 41:14.827
<i>I've worked with Mackey before.</i>

41:14.827 --> 41:16.517
<i>It can't have been easy.</i>

41:16.517 --> 41:18.000
I'm right here, sir.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.586
Happy to help. Any time.

41:19.586 --> 41:21.172
<i>Well,
I'm glad to hear it.</i>

41:21.172 --> 41:23.758
<i>That's the kind of attitude
we need moving forward.</i>

41:23.758 --> 41:26.896
Moving forward? To where?

41:31.137 --> 41:33.103
You know what?
Truth is we didn't really gel.

41:33.103 --> 41:34.275
Like, at all.

41:34.275 --> 41:35.655
She's a massive pain in the ass.

41:35.655 --> 41:38.068
We can't carry weapons and
they don't even speak English.

41:38.068 --> 41:39.275
We got lucky, to be honest.

41:39.275 --> 41:40.551
- He means we lucked out.
- Exactly.

41:40.551 --> 41:42.586
<i>I understand what he means
and I don't think</i>

41:42.586 --> 41:44.551
<i>luck has anything
to do with it at all,</i>

41:44.551 --> 41:46.413
<i>nor does Director Vance
for that matter.</i>

41:46.413 --> 41:48.137
<i>What do you think, Minister?</i>

41:55.310 --> 41:57.241
The beer was a nice touch.

41:57.241 --> 42:00.068
Hmm. In and out, they said.

42:00.068 --> 42:01.862
A week, maybe two.

42:01.862 --> 42:03.827
Come on. It's not so bad.

42:03.827 --> 42:08.172
Tell me you're not a little
excited to be working together.

42:08.172 --> 42:10.655
I barely know you.
I don't even like you.

42:10.655 --> 42:12.137
Sure you do.

42:12.137 --> 42:13.827
Anyway, I've been more worried
about how you're gonna

42:13.827 --> 42:16.793
break it to the Doc that he has
to stick around for a while.

42:18.137 --> 42:20.896
You gotta admit it has got
a certain ring to it.

42:23.034 --> 42:25.172
NCIS Sydney.

42:26.758 --> 42:30.724
It'll be fun. Just ditch
the suit, relax a little.

42:31.724 --> 42:34.103
Play your cards right, I might
even slip you a T-shirt.

42:34.103 --> 42:37.068
- Oh, you wouldn't.
- Try and stop me.

42:37.068 --> 42:39.862
Come on, partner. Beer's on me.
