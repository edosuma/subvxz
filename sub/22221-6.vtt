WEBVTT

00:09.010 --> 00:10.420
There's no rush.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.968
Browse all you like.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.347
Do you like that?

00:20.438 --> 00:23.305
I don't care much for
room decorations.

00:23.399 --> 00:27.358
I, uh... I preferto
decorate myself.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.855
Mmm, like this, for instance.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.902
Synthetic kamin stone.

00:30.990 --> 00:31.854
Worthless.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.325
Synthetic?
-Mm-hmm.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.320
If you like it, what difference
does it make?

00:35.411 --> 00:37.777
If it's not worth anything,
ldon't like it.

00:37.872 --> 00:41.205
Oh, so young and yet
so mercenary.

00:44.921 --> 00:47.958
That portrait is one of
me own works.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.131
Resembles you, don't you think?

00:50.218 --> 00:51.298
Not really.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.921
Ah.

00:53.012 --> 00:55.253
Look at this.

00:55.348 --> 00:58.181
Hynerian royal tiara from
the Neltoth era.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.303
Authentic Neltoth? Nonsense.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.261
It's a cheap copy.
And I should know.

01:03.356 --> 01:05.017
I gave them to all my wives.

01:05.107 --> 01:08.235
If you don't want it, Rygel,
put it back and we can all
get out of here.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.559
What's your rush?

01:09.654 --> 01:12.691
Is there anything remotely
exciting happening back on Moya?

01:12.782 --> 01:16.195
Aeryn:
Minding you two on a
shopping expedition is even less exciting.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.321
Nobody asked you to come.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.495
You should have that tiara, as a
keepsake of your home world.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.913
A fake keepsake?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.376
(laughing)

01:24.460 --> 01:28.749
I'll give you a single food cube
for it, and that's generous.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.170
Done.

01:30.258 --> 01:33.091
We're low on food cubes and you
gave one away for that?

01:33.177 --> 01:36.260
It's a good enough copy to fool
the next trader we run across.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.178
Fine. Can we go?

01:38.266 --> 01:40.723
Yes, now that I'm finished.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.175
Wonderful. Chiana?

01:42.270 --> 01:44.101
Are you done?

01:44.188 --> 01:45.348
Guess so.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.724
Don't go empty-handed.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.898
I want to give you this.

01:52.196 --> 01:55.563
Now, that's a better image,
don't you think?

01:57.368 --> 01:59.279
You just work on that?

02:00.204 --> 02:02.411
I didn't see you do it.

02:05.084 --> 02:06.415
Hey.

02:07.420 --> 02:10.287
That's my favorite necklace.

02:10.381 --> 02:11.461
I lost that half a cycle ago.

02:11.549 --> 02:15.383
Now you can enjoy that
once more.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.256
What, you're... you're just
giving it to me?

02:18.347 --> 02:22.511
Well, you haven't been given
much in your life,
have you, hmm?

02:23.269 --> 02:24.805
Take it.

02:28.232 --> 02:32.771
Perhaps it'll help you get a
better understanding of the
true value of art.

02:33.571 --> 02:36.313
Which is what?

02:36.407 --> 02:39.899
Well, in this case,
it's a window on time.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.293
This defense screen is
pretty much fried.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.665
I'm not even sure if
it's worth fixing.

02:52.757 --> 02:54.338
There's no harm in trying.

02:56.469 --> 02:57.925
You were saying?

02:58.012 --> 02:59.627
Just watch what you're doing.

02:59.722 --> 03:02.839
Pilot, I thought the juice
was supposed to be turned
off down here.

03:02.933 --> 03:08.348
It is, but Moya's been
experiencing a number of
minor power anomalies.

03:08.439 --> 03:09.770
I'm trying to isolate them.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.223
Then keep trying, and get us
some more DRDs.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.354
l have no more to spare.

03:14.445 --> 03:16.606
What about the ones working
on Aeryn's Prowler?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.198
Aren't they just doing
routine maintenance?

03:18.282 --> 03:21.069
Scheduled maintenance,
which is overdue.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.776
She would not be pleased to
postpone it further.

03:23.871 --> 03:24.951
Give us four of them.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.700
Aeryn doesn't have to know.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.324
She's just returned.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.298
Hey!

03:42.390 --> 03:43.505
Hey!

03:47.520 --> 03:49.351
Is that mine?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.643
I've been looking for
that forever.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.319
Where'd you find it?

03:59.407 --> 04:01.238
(electronic squeaking )

04:09.083 --> 04:11.916
And how did she know you'd...
you'd find it?

04:23.806 --> 04:28.266
( screaming )

04:33.691 --> 04:35.852
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.356
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.063
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:42.158 --> 04:45.491
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:45.578 --> 04:46.317
Help me.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.868
Listen, please.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.820
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:49.915 --> 04:54.204
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.411
I'm doing everything I can.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.417
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.195
Well, first, it didn't even
look like me at all.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.735
Then it showed me with
a necklace

05:21.822 --> 05:24.234
and then it showed me with
a broken leg. Okay?

05:24.325 --> 05:25.280
You know what I think?

05:25.367 --> 05:27.323
l... I think it can predict
the future.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.493
My Aunt Ruth can do that,
except she uses tea leaves.

05:29.580 --> 05:33.118
Oh, okay. Then how do you
explain this? And this?

05:33.209 --> 05:36.292
Have you eaten, drunk, smoked,
sniffed anything weird lately?

05:36.378 --> 05:37.458
No. Have you?

05:37.546 --> 05:38.922
Not lately.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.587
Look, ask Aeryn and Rygel.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.051
They saw it when it
showed me the necklace.

05:43.135 --> 05:43.999
They saw it change, too?

05:44.094 --> 05:45.220
No, but that doesn't mean...

05:45.304 --> 05:47.260
Could Aeryn and Rygel have
switched it for another,

05:47.348 --> 05:49.134
or tampered with it somehow?
-No, no, no.

05:49.225 --> 05:51.181
So, you think one of them's
messing with Chi?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.520
I'm only exploring
possibilities.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.765
Aeryn's not exactly the
joking type, and Rygel,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.347
I can see him pulling her leg
but not exactly breaking it.

05:58.442 --> 06:01.229
You said you tripped over a DRD
that found your necklace.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.400
Yeah.

06:02.488 --> 06:04.729
Pilot, is anything weird going
on with the DRDs?

06:04.823 --> 06:09.738
No. All DRDs are functioning
normally and performing
as I ordered.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.412
Pilot, did you assign a DRD to
look for Chiana's lost necklace?

06:13.499 --> 06:14.830
Yes.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.329
Some time ago, at her request.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.250
Well, there we have it.

06:19.338 --> 06:23.001
Coincidence, bad luck, maybe
a bit of power of suggestion
thrown in.

06:23.092 --> 06:26.380
Yeah, yeah, except it
did change.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.176
Well, I don't know what
to tell you.

06:28.264 --> 06:31.222
Zhaan:
I'd like to run some tests
on that portrait, if you don't mind.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.219
Yeah, I do mind. What if you
screw it up somehow?

06:33.310 --> 06:34.425
I'm not going to harm it.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.135
No, sorry. It's staying here.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.266
I mean, I want to see...

06:38.357 --> 06:40.313
I want to see what it's
going to show me next.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.983
Zhaan, how about if you take,
like a tiny little chip off

06:43.070 --> 06:45.106
someplace where it doesn't show?

06:45.197 --> 06:46.607
That work for you?

06:46.699 --> 06:48.064
Better than nothing.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.659
But it's mine. I don't see
why I should let her...

06:49.743 --> 06:53.031
Pip! She just fixed
your damn leg.

06:55.124 --> 06:58.616
A very little piece.

06:58.711 --> 07:00.542
( sniffing )

07:00.629 --> 07:03.211
Ohh! Definitely it.

07:03.299 --> 07:05.665
I never forget an aroma.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.462
( sizzling )
What?

07:11.557 --> 07:14.344
Genuine? Not possible.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.426
N0... Oh!

07:16.520 --> 07:20.308
I'm surprised your using
my possessions without
my consent, Rygel,

07:20.399 --> 07:23.311
especially after what I did
to you the last time.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.064
Let go! I'll replace
what I've used.

07:26.155 --> 07:29.147
I'll buy you an entire
vat of Pelvoth oil!

07:29.241 --> 07:32.199
This tiara is authentic!
( chuckling )

07:32.286 --> 07:33.901
I thought you said it
was a copy.

07:33.996 --> 07:35.281
Well, it's not.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.364
And that fool Kyvan sold it
for a single food cube.

07:38.459 --> 07:42.372
Ha! Silly old woman had
no idea what she had.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.246
Pilot, reverse course.

07:45.341 --> 07:47.753
Huh?
-Find that trader woman's ship.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.208
Ignore him, Pilot.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.794
Moya has better things to do
than search for Kyvan's vessel.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.004
Agreed.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.054
What the yotz are you
talking about?!

07:55.142 --> 07:58.305
We have a chance to turn
a tidy profit here.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.135
Have you any idea what
this is worth?

08:00.230 --> 08:04.143
We are not returning to
that ship, Rygel.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.223
Now get out!

08:05.319 --> 08:07.901
I'll take this up with
the others.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.694
Please do.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.239
Isn't this something?

08:13.327 --> 08:16.239
Wonder what it'll show me next?

08:16.330 --> 08:21.199
Suppose it's notjust predicting
events but actually
causing them?

08:21.293 --> 08:25.036
It brought me back my necklace,
and then it turned around
and broke my leg.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.916
Why would it do that?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.463
I don't know.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.213
Well, then why not just believe
it's what the old woman
says it is?

08:32.304 --> 08:34.465
A window into time?

08:34.556 --> 08:36.171
Assuming all that is true,

08:36.266 --> 08:40.259
do you really want to know
what the future holds?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.186
Of course I do.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.889
Come on, D'Argo, don't you want
to know if you're ever going
to find your son?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.599
No.

08:47.695 --> 08:51.608
If it's bad news, then, uh,
I don't want to lose all hope.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.574
Well, it might keep you from
spending your whole life

08:55.661 --> 08:57.902
searching for something that's
never going to happen.

08:57.996 --> 09:02.239
If I don't try, it will
definitely never happen.

09:02.334 --> 09:07.579
Now, I want you to get
rid of that.

09:07.673 --> 09:11.165
I think you're just being
a superstitious Luxan.

09:11.260 --> 09:15.754
I am being a concerned Luxan.

09:15.848 --> 09:19.215
Oh. Aren't you sweet.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.846
What, you really care about
what happens to me?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.936
Shouldn't l?

09:25.023 --> 09:26.809
Of course you should.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.683
I'm glad you do.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.858
Wonder if the portrait will
show both of us next?

09:36.952 --> 09:39.284
Give us a glimpse of our future.

09:39.371 --> 09:42.784
I'm not sure I want to know
about that, either.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.332
Why, 'cause of what it
might not show?

09:46.336 --> 09:48.201
Or what it might?

09:50.132 --> 09:51.872
Listen to me...

09:53.844 --> 09:56.506
I do care about you.

09:59.391 --> 10:02.428
That's why I want you to
start being sensible and
get rid of that.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.057
Oh, okay, so I'm not being
sensible now?

10:06.148 --> 10:10.016
Well, I'm so sorry to disappoint
you, but I'm keeping it.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.936
I need to rest now.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.780
Alone.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.207
Even if the object did change,
it's still just a trick.

10:27.294 --> 10:30.912
I've seen con artists on many
planets pull off bigger
frauds than that.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.371
Yeah, well, she got it for free,

10:32.466 --> 10:34.878
so it's not much of a score
if it's a con.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.219
Chiana insulted Kyvan's artwork.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.136
Maybe Kyvan wanted revenge
or something.

10:39.223 --> 10:41.555
So what, you think that
she rigged the paintings

10:41.642 --> 10:44.008
so that Chiana would be spooked
into breaking her leg?

10:44.102 --> 10:45.262
That's a bit of a stretch.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.140
What's your theory?
That it can predict the future?

10:47.231 --> 10:50.348
No. I don't have a theory,
just a hypothesis.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.228
We should've steered clear
of Kyvan's ship.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.856
And as usual, we have Rygel and
Chiana to thank for that.

10:54.947 --> 10:59.190
There isn't a single flying junk
dealer in the Uncharted
Territories that they'd pass up.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.149
Well, you know what I say.

11:01.245 --> 11:04.078
I say, we lock all of
Moya's doors,

11:04.164 --> 11:07.281
we don't let anybody in,
we don't let anybody out.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.209
That way we get no
alien critters,
no shape-shifting bugs,

11:10.295 --> 11:13.287
no... (sniffing)
mind-altering viruses,

11:13.382 --> 11:15.998
no freaky-deaky artifacts.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.425
If I had my way, I'd throw
Rygel off the ship.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.843
Chiana, too, maybe.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.046
Huh?

11:22.140 --> 11:24.426
Rygel I can sort of understand,
but Chiana?

11:24.518 --> 11:27.225
She's gets us into nearly as
much trouble as Rygel does.

11:27.312 --> 11:31.430
Yeah, but she means well.
Sometimes.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.935
That's not the point.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.812
Then what is the point?

11:34.903 --> 11:37.770
You know, even Rygel has his
moments once in a while.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.196
Once in a great while.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.444
On balance, we'd probably be
better off without them.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.160
Oh, yeah?

11:45.247 --> 11:48.205
Well, what about Zhaan?
Want to throw her off the ship?

11:48.917 --> 11:49.952
Possibly.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.374
D'Argo?

11:52.754 --> 11:54.210
Me?

11:58.218 --> 12:00.334
Pilot. Let's get rid of Pilot.

12:00.429 --> 12:03.466
That'd be good, then you can
have the whole ship to yourself.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.047
Hmm, is that an offer?

12:05.142 --> 12:07.975
Well let's start with this room
and see how it goes.

12:12.816 --> 12:16.274
(whispering voices)

12:21.366 --> 12:22.572
Crichton:
Zhaan.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.990
(glass shatters )
Whoa, hang on.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.114
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

12:27.205 --> 12:28.866
Is everything okay?

12:28.957 --> 12:30.538
No, it isn't.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.705
No.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.048
Well, you want to tell me?

12:38.717 --> 12:40.799
How can I tell you what
I don't know?

12:40.886 --> 12:47.132
Every test I try finds nothing
unusual in the material of
Chiana's portrait.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.262
So, if that junk dealer's faking
us outwith a magic trick,

12:50.354 --> 12:52.094
you can't figure out how.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.521
Look, don't worry
about it, okay?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.144
The painting probably
neverchanged.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.816
Chiana was hallucinating.
It's all in her mind.

12:58.904 --> 13:00.314
No, John.

13:00.405 --> 13:04.239
Believe me, this is not
in Chiana's mind.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.782
She's in danger.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.319
From what?

13:10.207 --> 13:13.825
Zhaan, tell me.

13:13.919 --> 13:16.001
I can't tell you yet.

13:16.088 --> 13:18.170
All l have are suspicions.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.713
But if I'm right...

13:23.428 --> 13:26.044
John...

13:26.139 --> 13:29.631
soon there may come a time when
I need you, and everyone,

13:29.726 --> 13:32.103
to do exactly as I say,

13:32.187 --> 13:35.350
quickly and without question.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.442
Do you have enough faith
in me to obey?

13:44.241 --> 13:46.232
Okay, Zhaan.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.570
Whatever you're doing,

13:48.662 --> 13:50.573
taking a flyer, playing a
hunch, I'm in.

13:50.664 --> 13:54.748
I can't speak for the others,
but when the time comes for you
to make your move,

13:54.835 --> 13:55.870
l'll back you up.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.121
Thank you, John.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.871
I want you to bring me
Chiana's portrait.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.252
Yeah, it'll look nice in here.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.050
I don't want to look at it.

14:06.138 --> 14:08.220
I want to destroy it.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.263
One portrait coming up.

14:31.830 --> 14:36.290
Crichton, I've decided we must
take that painting away from
Chiana. It's no good for her.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.412
Zhaan's way ahead of you there.
Whatever it is, it's
got her good...

14:38.503 --> 14:39.834
(Chiana screams)
freaked.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.252
D'Argo!

14:41.548 --> 14:42.754
Help!

14:44.384 --> 14:45.214
What happened?!

14:45.302 --> 14:46.257
Itchanged!

14:46.344 --> 14:47.208
When did it change?

14:47.304 --> 14:48.635
Just now.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.587
I looked away for no more
than a microt.

14:50.682 --> 14:51.888
Where are you going?!

14:51.975 --> 14:53.886
I'm getting out of here!
Let go!

14:53.977 --> 14:56.138
Help me! Please take me
somewhere safe!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.309
|wi||. |wi||.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.182
You deal with that.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.183
Yeah, no problem.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.559
But Zhaan wants to do
the honors.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.641
What is going on?
I heard screaming.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.193
I'm going to die, Aeryn.
The portrait told me.
-Told you what?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.396
It changed again.
This time it shows her on fire.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.072
This is a load of dren.

15:09.159 --> 15:10.695
It's real! I'm burning up!

15:10.786 --> 15:12.902
Chiana, you're fine.
You don't even feel hot.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.281
I'm burning up!

15:15.207 --> 15:17.198
Zhaan, it happened again.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.328
Chiana said it happened in
the blink of an eye.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.750
Where is she?

15:20.837 --> 15:22.828
She's in the Cargo Bay with
D'Argo and Aeryn.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.003
Go. I'll see what I can do here.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.297
Right.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.143
Put me in there!

15:42.234 --> 15:43.144
I'm going.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.442
In the freezer, Chiana?

15:47.781 --> 15:50.193
Chiana, listen to me.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.864
It's all in your head.

15:51.952 --> 15:52.941
Leave her alone.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.321
Are you completely out
of your mind?

15:54.412 --> 15:56.619
If she doesn't freeze to death
in there, she will suffocate.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.118
Pilot, how long can Chiana
last in there?

15:59.209 --> 16:03.202
Indefinitely, ifl raise the
temperature and maintain
airflow.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.627
Do it.

16:04.714 --> 16:05.999
Don't tell me you're going along
with this nonsense too.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.797
I don't see any danger in
playing it safe.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.875
If you cater to her fears,
you'll make them worse.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.721
(whispering voices)

16:27.028 --> 16:29.155
(whimpering)

16:31.825 --> 16:33.440
John.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.235
What the hell?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.412
Pilot, what's going on in there?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.614
I don't know.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.745
Nothing should be combustible.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.082
Pilot, this door is jammed.
Open it!

16:46.173 --> 16:48.255
The door controls
aren't responding.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.501
( screaming )

16:49.593 --> 16:50.924
Stand back.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.547
Stand back!

16:54.389 --> 16:56.220
( screaming )

17:07.652 --> 17:09.392
Chiana!

17:14.326 --> 17:18.410
The door Iock's responding now.
I think I can open it.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.417
( sizzling )

17:28.298 --> 17:32.211
Pilot:
Crichton? ls Chiana...

17:33.345 --> 17:35.461
She's gone, Pilot.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.929
(sighs)

17:42.729 --> 17:46.597
(Zhaan chanting in Delvian)

17:53.365 --> 17:55.071
It's true then?

17:55.158 --> 17:57.399
Chiana's death?

17:57.494 --> 17:59.450
It's true, Rygel.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.248
She died that way?

18:03.333 --> 18:04.288
Yes.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.162
Then why couldn't you save her?

18:06.253 --> 18:09.416
You had warning.
You could have done something.

18:09.506 --> 18:14.250
At least we tried, which is more
than I can say for you.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.834
Where were you when she died?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.170
Sleeping? Eating?

18:18.265 --> 18:21.132
Had anyone seen fit to
inform me I...

18:21.226 --> 18:22.557
Get out.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.144
I should have gone down
to the ship with them.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.351
I should have stopped her
from bringing it back.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.437
No, I should have taken it
away from her earlier.

18:38.451 --> 18:42.364
There are a number of things
we all should have done.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.873
And we can do one of
them right now.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.077
Zhaan, how do we dispose of
this piece ofjunk?

18:53.425 --> 18:56.087
Fire would be a fitting end.

19:10.525 --> 19:13.392
(chanting in Delvian)

19:25.373 --> 19:27.204
There was no reason for it.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.327
There has to be.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.125
What about a defective power
doubler in the freezer?

19:31.212 --> 19:33.669
All its components
check out fine.

19:33.757 --> 19:37.341
All right. Well, you said that
Moya had some energy surges

19:37.427 --> 19:38.792
and other anomalies it
couldn't isolate.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.218
Maybe this is related to it.

19:40.305 --> 19:42.421
There was nothing wrong
with the freezer.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.380
Why couldn't you get the door
open in time then?

19:44.476 --> 19:47.218
Chiana must have jammed it
when she closed it.

19:47.312 --> 19:50.349
All right. Could she have
damaged the conduit when
she pulled it shut?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.646
I've told you.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.315
No malfunction of Moya's
caused that fire,

19:54.402 --> 19:57.360
nor was it an error of
control on my part.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.779
All right. I'm not blaming you,
Pilot, but something had
to cause it...

19:59.866 --> 20:02.357
Aeryn, knock it off.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.117
It's not your fault.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.283
Who said it was?

20:07.374 --> 20:09.160
Well, you're grilling Pilot,
looking for a reason.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.035
You're not the reason.

20:10.126 --> 20:12.242
No, I'm not. Why would I be?

20:12.337 --> 20:13.827
You wanted her off the ship.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.208
I never said I wanted
her dead, Crichton.

20:16.299 --> 20:21.089
Fine. Now, are you always
going to do this?

20:21.179 --> 20:22.214
Do what?

20:22.305 --> 20:25.172
Keep the entire world
at a distance!

20:25.266 --> 20:27.131
Keep everybody away?

20:27.227 --> 20:29.559
Is that ever going to change?

20:29.646 --> 20:31.136
D'Argo:
Crichton.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.311
Yes, D'Argo.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.936
Come to the Center Chamber.
We have a problem.

20:35.026 --> 20:35.981
Pilot?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.605
No idea.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.276
Crichton:
What's the problem?

20:42.367 --> 20:44.358
This is.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.235
Another one.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.285
It can't be the same one.
We burned it up.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.456
Khalaan help us.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.284
Looks like you, D'Argo.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.124
Yes, it does.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.830
It appears unfinished.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.210
Still in flux.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.132
I vote we don't wait around
for it to develop.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.756
I agree.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.593
It repaired itself once,
it may do so again.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.346
Then it shall do so in space.
Pilot, where's the nearest
access shaft?

21:10.437 --> 21:12.678
I want this thing as far away
from Moya as I can.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.433
Tier Three, Hamman side.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.684
Zhaan, you cool with that?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.151
Yes. Get rid of it.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.317
I'll go and find that trader
and get some answers.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.689
Pilot, is my Prowler ready?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.816
No, it's still undergoing
maintenance.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.238
Take my module.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.065
Bucket of dren.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.957
(glass shattering )

21:39.048 --> 21:40.299
Go for it, Pilot.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.169
Expelling now.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.175
I am tracking the fragments.

21:48.266 --> 21:51.133
We are moving away from them
at Hetch Six velocity.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.603
Works for me.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.224
I don't know art but I know
what I don't like.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.223
Zhaan:
You're certain it's gone?

21:58.318 --> 22:00.684
Crichton:
Far behind us and off the radar.

22:00.778 --> 22:04.111
Once Aeryn returns, we should do
a Starburst or two to make sure.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.565
Yeah, the more distance between
us and that thing the better.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.945
(whispering voices)

22:10.830 --> 22:12.240
What's the matter?

22:12.332 --> 22:13.947
I thought I heard something.

22:14.042 --> 22:18.081
(whispering voices)
Pa'u Zhaan.

22:20.840 --> 22:27.461
(whispering voices)
Pa'u Zhaan... Pa'u Zhaan...

22:32.268 --> 22:33.428
Zhaan?

22:34.938 --> 22:38.430
Pa'u Zhaan....

22:39.901 --> 22:41.562
Pa'u Zhaan....

22:42.445 --> 22:43.901
Pa'u Zhaan....

22:44.614 --> 22:46.104
Pa'u Zhaan...

22:46.533 --> 22:48.023
Pa'u Zhaan...

22:48.618 --> 22:50.279
Pa'u Zhaan...

22:51.204 --> 22:52.239
Pa'u Zhaan...

22:52.330 --> 22:54.366
(engines whooshing)

23:00.421 --> 23:01.752
(gasps )

23:01.839 --> 23:03.704
(yells)

23:03.800 --> 23:05.256
Don't shoot! It's me!

23:05.343 --> 23:06.628
Reason enough to pull
the trigger.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.175
What are you doing here?

23:08.263 --> 23:10.504
Don't you think I have a score
to settle with this Kyvan,

23:10.598 --> 23:11.713
just as you do?

23:11.808 --> 23:13.344
Score to settle or
a profit to make?

23:13.434 --> 23:15.299
Can't I accomplish both at once?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.886
Chiana was given a
dangerous product.

23:17.981 --> 23:20.518
Kyvan, therefore, owes
us restitution.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.896
Chiana's dead, and all you're
concerned about is getting
compensation.

23:23.987 --> 23:27.571
Punitive damages. That's what
Chiana would have wanted.

23:27.657 --> 23:30.194
She was quite a lot like me,
you know?

23:30.285 --> 23:32.526
She had spirit, ambition.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.236
Ha, large appetites.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.993
She would have made an
excellent Hynerian.

23:38.084 --> 23:42.327
I'm actually going to miss her.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.789
One way or another, Kyvan
will make restitution.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.339
( switches clicking )

23:54.976 --> 23:57.012
Zhaan:
D'Argo...

23:57.562 --> 23:59.803
By the goddess, no!

24:02.859 --> 24:04.815
What do we have to do
to ditch this thing?

24:04.902 --> 24:06.688
Drop it in a black hole?

24:06.779 --> 24:10.943
John, we've lost.

24:11.034 --> 24:13.241
If this is my fate,
I'll accept it.

24:13.328 --> 24:16.286
No, we're not accepting
anything. We fight this.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.657
We can't keep fighting.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.239
Zhaan...
-|t's stronger than all of us.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.744
Zhaan!

24:23.087 --> 24:26.124
All right, kids, time to think.

24:26.215 --> 24:31.300
First off, what the hell is
that supposed to be?

24:31.387 --> 24:34.174
It signifies a Qualta Blade.

24:41.481 --> 24:45.770
Crichton:
Zhaan, take this, lock it away
in the farthest tier you can find.

24:49.614 --> 24:50.649
Next,

24:50.740 --> 24:54.858
we get you into a big,
open space,

24:54.952 --> 24:57.409
as far away from any pointy
objects as possible.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.657
John...

25:03.419 --> 25:06.035
you've been a good friend.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.712
Whatever happens it's been a
pleasure to know you.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.166
D'Argo...

25:12.261 --> 25:15.469
shut up!

25:15.556 --> 25:18.423
Have you never heard of a
self-fulfilling prophecy?

25:23.564 --> 25:24.394
No!

25:24.482 --> 25:26.598
( screams )

25:34.075 --> 25:36.407
( D'Argo shouting )

25:43.251 --> 25:44.957
Chiana:
Anybody?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.375
Please?

25:49.215 --> 25:50.716
( echoing ):
Chiana!

25:50.800 --> 25:52.540
( echoing ):
D'Argo?

26:04.814 --> 26:06.179
D'Argo!

26:08.443 --> 26:09.979
(laughing)

26:10.069 --> 26:11.445
You're alive.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.318
I am?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.072
Where are we?

26:17.660 --> 26:19.446
Uh...

26:20.079 --> 26:20.989
I, uh...

26:21.080 --> 26:22.160
lthink...

26:22.248 --> 26:23.863
I think we're in the portrait.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.419
(angry shout)

26:30.506 --> 26:35.921
It punched right through him,
and then he disappeared.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.095
No blood, no guts, no nothing.

26:39.182 --> 26:40.797
Where'd he go?

26:40.892 --> 26:45.261
We got to get him back.
He could notjust vanish, Zhaan.

26:46.314 --> 26:47.520
John.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.440
He may not even be dead.
Either way, we got to know.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.437
What?

26:57.533 --> 26:59.148
Great.

27:00.244 --> 27:01.495
I'm next.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.322
Batter up.

27:05.416 --> 27:07.657
This is great, Zhaan.

27:07.752 --> 27:11.495
This thing is picking us off
like flies and nobody even
knows what it is.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.214
Zhaan, I'm ready.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.633
Just give me your plan, please?

27:18.763 --> 27:20.299
Come on, Zhaan.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.881
This magical mystery crap is
your speciality, not mine.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.558
You just tell me what to do
and I'll do it!

27:28.064 --> 27:30.555
There is nothing I can tell you.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.362
Kyvan:
Ah, welcome back!

27:42.453 --> 27:44.614
Now, what can I interest
you in this time?

27:44.705 --> 27:47.412
Only interested in one thing
and that's the thing you
gave Chiana.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.616
Oh well, I hope she's enjoying
that portrait.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.838
Don't frell around with me.
You know exactly what
happens, don't you?

27:52.922 --> 27:57.006
It's a very bad idea to annoy
her when she's in this
sort of mood.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.003
See what I mean?

27:59.095 --> 28:01.302
If I were you, I'd tell
her everything.

28:01.389 --> 28:02.845
But I don't know anything.

28:02.932 --> 28:04.763
That's unfortunate for you,
isn't it?

28:04.851 --> 28:07.342
Because if you had something
to tell me I'd have a reason
not to shoot you

28:07.436 --> 28:09.392
but since you're not telling
me anything...

28:09.480 --> 28:11.516
Ahh! I had no choice!

28:11.607 --> 28:14.269
I was forced to create
that portrait!

28:14.360 --> 28:15.349
By whom?

28:15.444 --> 28:17.105
Wh... he made me do it.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.185
Who? Who?

28:18.281 --> 28:19.566
Who?
-I didn't want to!

28:19.657 --> 28:21.568
He threatened me!
-Who?

28:23.327 --> 28:25.067
Maldis.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.199
Maldis.

28:31.294 --> 28:32.659
Aeryn:
That's what she said.

28:32.753 --> 28:35.415
It can't be Maldis.
We destroyed him.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.956
We only dispersed him.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.211
I knew he'd coalesce
again someday.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.760
I never dreamt it would
be this soon.

28:43.848 --> 28:46.055
Okay, Zhaan, so what do we do?

28:47.560 --> 28:49.926
Zhaan, what do we...?

28:51.147 --> 28:53.138
Are you hearing me, Zhaan?

28:53.858 --> 28:55.473
Crichton, what's the matter?

28:55.568 --> 28:57.183
Zhaan just bugged out on us.

28:57.278 --> 29:00.190
Praying or catatonic,
I don't know.

29:00.281 --> 29:01.612
I'll leave straightaway.

29:01.699 --> 29:03.030
No, no, don't do that.

29:03.117 --> 29:05.779
Stay there, we need all the
information we can get.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.360
Right.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.365
So...

29:12.460 --> 29:14.121
start talking.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.248
Nothing that I can tell you
will do any good.

29:17.340 --> 29:20.082
Maldis is too powerful.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.295
Start talking.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.724
Zhaan...

29:31.228 --> 29:32.388
Zhaan!

29:32.480 --> 29:35.313
Stop bugging out!

29:35.399 --> 29:38.607
We beat Maldis before.
We can do it again.

29:38.694 --> 29:41.356
Don't go chicken on me here.

29:43.282 --> 29:48.151
John, I speak to you via the
bond of Unity we shared.

29:48.245 --> 29:51.328
Now is the time to trust me.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.246
I have a plan.

29:53.334 --> 29:59.295
You must focus Maldis's
attention on you for as
long as possible.

29:59.382 --> 30:00.918
Ignore what I say next.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.248
( both gasping )

30:02.343 --> 30:04.129
Maldis cannot be defeated.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.711
He's already taken
Chiana and D'Argo.

30:06.806 --> 30:10.640
He's going to take you next,
then the rest of us, one by one.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.307
Zhaan, we can beat him.

30:12.395 --> 30:13.726
No, we can't.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.896
All we can do is surrender,
shorten our pain.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.314
Well, I'm not giving up.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.488
lam.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.168
(whispering voices)
Pa'u Zhaan...

30:42.842 --> 30:45.754
Pa'u Zhaan.

30:56.313 --> 30:57.974
Pa'u Zhaan. Pa'u Zhaan.

31:00.401 --> 31:02.517
(eerie laughter)

31:05.489 --> 31:07.445
(grunts)

31:15.458 --> 31:19.246
Oh, that first step.

31:19.336 --> 31:20.872
D'Argo:
John.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.459
No, wait, don't come through!

31:28.054 --> 31:30.386
Wh... what the hell?

31:33.309 --> 31:35.391
( echoing ):
D'Argo?

31:40.858 --> 31:42.314
Where the hell did you go?

31:42.401 --> 31:46.110
I haven't moved.
It's these archways.
They lead... elsewhere.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.815
You seen Chiana?

31:50.910 --> 31:52.116
Yes, but I couldn't get to her.

31:52.203 --> 31:55.195
I tried other archways,
but I lost her entirely.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.247
Great.

31:58.334 --> 32:01.246
It's notjust a painting,
it's a maze.

32:01.337 --> 32:02.417
(dry chuckle)

32:03.756 --> 32:05.417
Terrific.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.419
And I know who built it.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.423
Maldis!

32:11.514 --> 32:13.129
Come on down!

32:13.224 --> 32:14.339
Maldis?

32:14.433 --> 32:17.095
None other than.
Doesn't that just make your day?

32:17.853 --> 32:19.969
Maldis?

32:21.398 --> 32:23.104
Maldis?

32:23.192 --> 32:26.901
Come on, you old bastard.
Show me your ugly face!

32:27.988 --> 32:29.603
Haven't you read the
supervillain's handbook?

32:29.698 --> 32:34.408
This is where you're supposed to
twirl your mustache and gloat.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.033
I don't have a mustache, John.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.454
How you doing, old man?

32:44.463 --> 32:46.624
You're looking kind of pale.
You getting enough sun?

32:46.715 --> 32:48.876
Irreverent as ever.

32:48.968 --> 32:50.299
I missed that.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.593
Yeah, it's been a while, huh?

32:52.680 --> 32:56.047
Tell me, what you been doing
all this time? Putting yourself
back together?

32:56.142 --> 32:59.600
And what's it like
being dispersed?

32:59.687 --> 33:01.894
Less than pleasant.

33:01.981 --> 33:06.771
I sustained myself by
concentrating on revenge.

33:06.861 --> 33:09.318
Well, here I am, dude.

33:09.405 --> 33:10.986
Revenge away.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.734
Please.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.406
You're not even a player.

33:14.493 --> 33:19.453
I'm saving my revenge for one
who deserves it. Pa'u Zhaan.

33:19.540 --> 33:22.703
Oh, I'm crushed.

33:22.793 --> 33:26.206
And here I was thinking we both
kicked your ass last time.

33:26.297 --> 33:29.539
No, she kicked my ass,
and saved yours.

33:29.633 --> 33:33.546
As you say, this magical mystery
crap's not your thing.

33:33.637 --> 33:37.425
Why do you think that I took you
and your two friends first?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.472
Because you were lonely.

33:39.560 --> 33:43.769
Because I wanted Zhaan to see
her shipmates die.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.313
Maldis (echoing ):
Pa'u Zhaan!

33:46.942 --> 33:48.478
Pa'u Zhaan!

33:48.569 --> 33:49.433
No!

33:49.528 --> 33:51.314
Pa'u Zhaan!

33:51.405 --> 33:53.396
Pa'u Zhaan!

33:54.241 --> 33:55.321
No!

33:55.409 --> 33:57.365
Pa'u Zhaan!

33:57.453 --> 33:58.784
No!

34:00.206 --> 34:01.161
Pa'u Zhaan!

34:01.248 --> 34:04.035
(echoing louder ):
Pa'u Zhaan!

34:04.126 --> 34:05.741
No!

34:07.004 --> 34:08.619
No!

34:09.340 --> 34:11.797
No!

34:12.509 --> 34:14.761
Have you forgotten?

34:14.845 --> 34:18.087
Fear makes me stronger.

34:18.182 --> 34:21.549
Fear and the terror of
helplessness.

34:21.644 --> 34:24.386
These are a few of my
favorite things.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.970
Oh.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.932
Could you do that "farewell,
good-bye" song the kids sing?

34:29.026 --> 34:30.061
It's one of my favorites.

34:30.152 --> 34:34.020
( echoing ):
I don't do requests!

34:34.114 --> 34:39.029
You're convinced that Zhaan will
pull some Delvian fast one and
save the day.

34:39.787 --> 34:42.119
Johnny-O...

34:42.206 --> 34:46.290
Your mind, to me, is
an open book,

34:46.377 --> 34:49.210
full of big print and
lots of pictures.

34:49.296 --> 34:51.287
Then read this.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.547
Kiss...

34:56.428 --> 34:59.886
I'm betting on her, not you.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.722
Bad bet.

35:01.809 --> 35:04.221
Do you understand, Pilot?

35:04.311 --> 35:05.926
Frankly, no.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.558
But I will do exactly as
you've asked.

35:08.649 --> 35:12.141
I wish you luck, for
all our sakes.

35:12.236 --> 35:14.352
(eerie whispering ):
Pa'u Zhaan...

35:15.948 --> 35:17.438
Zhaan...

35:17.533 --> 35:19.319
What is it?

35:19.410 --> 35:21.617
It's Maldis. Can't you hear him?

35:21.704 --> 35:23.194
I don't hear anything.

35:23.289 --> 35:24.244
Johnny!

35:24.331 --> 35:26.037
Last bout she had help.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.537
Cost the poor fellow his life,
didn't it?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.868
This time, she's alone.

35:30.963 --> 35:34.501
You might not be afraid,
but she is.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.877
And that's why I'll destroy her.

35:36.969 --> 35:41.713
Excuse me, while I remind her
how much I care.

35:43.225 --> 35:46.843
Pa'u Zhaan!

35:48.939 --> 35:49.724
Zhaan!

35:49.815 --> 35:51.521
( shouting )

35:54.445 --> 35:56.902
So much for that plan!

35:58.407 --> 36:00.272
Any more bets?

36:03.537 --> 36:05.243
I failed.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.617
Too weak.

36:07.708 --> 36:10.074
Zhaan, don't give up.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.876
You never give up.

36:12.963 --> 36:14.419
Maldis:
What a wreck!

36:14.506 --> 36:17.088
She begged me to put her
out of her misery.

36:17.176 --> 36:21.294
Unfortunately, I want to enjoy
her misery a little longer.

36:21.388 --> 36:25.927
But there's no reason why she
should suffer on her own.

36:29.313 --> 36:30.928
Chiana:
D'Argo?

36:32.775 --> 36:34.185
Where are you?

36:34.276 --> 36:35.391
Chiana.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.568
You're here?

36:41.992 --> 36:44.108
Oh, frell.

36:45.913 --> 36:48.154
Who's the ugly old man?

36:48.248 --> 36:49.328
Crichton:
Name is Maldis.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.532
He's your basic evil vampire.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.413
He sucks the life force
out of people.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.665
He just plain sucks.
Listen up, everybody.

36:55.756 --> 37:00.341
This joker feeds on fear so
we're going to stay calm.

37:00.427 --> 37:02.668
Zhaan's not listening
to you, John.

37:02.763 --> 37:08.975
Zhaan, we keep our cool,
we starve him out.

37:09.061 --> 37:14.226
Bravado to the end. I have to
admire that. even though,
deep down, of course

37:14.316 --> 37:17.558
you are quaking in your boots.

37:17.653 --> 37:18.517
Dream on.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.648
Stop. You want fear?

37:20.739 --> 37:22.445
I'll give you some.

37:25.119 --> 37:30.113
Picture if you will, me standing
on your home planet.

37:30.207 --> 37:33.995
Six billion creatures like you?
Heavy breeders.

37:34.086 --> 37:37.169
Your species would've kept me
well fed for a long time.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.087
You stay the hell away
from Earth.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.334
You see?

37:40.426 --> 37:43.418
Everyone has a panic button
just waiting to be pushed.

37:43.512 --> 37:45.969
Even the Luxan.

37:46.056 --> 37:48.138
Your son, Jothee.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.136
How old is he?

37:50.227 --> 37:52.934
I can't wait to run across him.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.148
(roaring)

37:55.232 --> 37:58.349
Didn't you tell him, John, that
that sort of thing doesn't work?

37:58.444 --> 38:00.230
And the runaway Nebari.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.232
How would you like a free trip
home to your planet?

38:03.323 --> 38:04.608
You wouldn't?

38:04.700 --> 38:08.909
Ah, scared that you'd be
mentally cleansed by
your countrymen?

38:08.996 --> 38:10.987
Well, don't worry...

38:11.081 --> 38:14.369
( echoing ):
because none of you will
leave this place!

38:14.460 --> 38:15.791
Chiana:
You don't scare me.

38:15.878 --> 38:16.958
You're all mouth.

38:17.045 --> 38:20.037
Bigger the talk,
smaller the action.

38:20.132 --> 38:24.091
Little girl, I'll show you
action and this is it.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.510
I leave, you don't.

38:27.598 --> 38:29.634
This realm dissolves
and you with it,

38:29.725 --> 38:34.890
except of course for your
essence, your life force,
your spirit,

38:34.980 --> 38:36.811
whatever you like to call it.

38:36.899 --> 38:39.891
(echoing):
I call it lunch.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.735
Time for choir practice, priest?

38:44.239 --> 38:47.697
Maldis, please!

38:47.784 --> 38:49.115
I beg you!

38:49.203 --> 38:51.194
(Zhaan screaming )
Oh, you beg me.

38:51.288 --> 38:52.698
I like that.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.199
Maldis!

38:54.291 --> 38:55.906
D'Argo, don't.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.208
You'll just make it worse.

38:58.295 --> 39:01.287
When all the atoms in your body
are ripped apart,

39:01.381 --> 39:03.872
and I consume what's left,

39:03.967 --> 39:06.800
then you'll know what pain is.

39:08.347 --> 39:14.217
And all this will happen in
100 microts from now.

39:14.311 --> 39:15.141
(moaning)

39:15.229 --> 39:18.437
If you like countdowns.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.693
Officer Sun, priority message
from Zhaan.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.154
What is it, Pilot?

39:35.249 --> 39:38.036
Kill Kyvan and get out
of there fast.

39:38.126 --> 39:39.286
Acknowledged.

39:42.464 --> 39:44.079
(Rygel yelling)

39:44.174 --> 39:45.675
Out. Now.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.305
(yelling)

40:01.400 --> 40:03.436
How did you know all
that would happen?

40:03.527 --> 40:04.357
I didn't.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.355
And you shot Kyvan anyway?

40:06.446 --> 40:08.983
Crichton said I should follow
Zhaan's instructions
without question.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.690
Did he? Well, he didn't
bother to tell me.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.242
Of course not. When have you
ever followed instructions?

40:15.080 --> 40:16.820
Was that your doing?

40:16.915 --> 40:21.284
Well, it won't help you, because
I'm much stronger than
you think.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.459
So am I.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.680
(Maldis screaming)

40:38.353 --> 40:39.889
Go!

40:39.980 --> 40:41.891
Hurry! Hurry!

40:43.233 --> 40:44.609
Chiana!

40:47.529 --> 40:48.484
Crichton:
Get up!

40:48.572 --> 40:49.778
Leave me.
-Come on.

40:49.865 --> 40:52.197
(yelling)

40:56.830 --> 40:58.411
(grunting)

41:00.250 --> 41:01.160
Leave me here.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.286
Get up.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.368
No, leave me here.

41:04.463 --> 41:05.327
No!

41:05.422 --> 41:07.083
(grunting)

41:14.806 --> 41:16.512
(grunting)

41:28.278 --> 41:29.609
Home sweet home.

41:38.789 --> 41:39.653
Fire one!

41:39.748 --> 41:41.158
(yelling)

41:43.043 --> 41:44.032
Great.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.468
Fire two!

41:54.554 --> 41:56.385
(yelling)

42:21.248 --> 42:23.284
That was your plan?

42:25.460 --> 42:27.872
Yes. Like it?

42:31.341 --> 42:33.878
Well, what's not to like?

42:35.470 --> 42:37.722
(audible exhale)

42:46.481 --> 42:48.437
Explain this to me, Froggy.

42:48.525 --> 42:51.767
Crichton comes back, he's not
really electrocuted.

42:51.862 --> 42:54.353
Okay, D'Argo comes back,
not a scratch on him.

42:54.448 --> 42:58.532
I come back, nothing burnt,
but I still got a busted leg.

42:58.618 --> 43:00.779
Why is that?
-Why ask me?

43:00.871 --> 43:04.455
I'm still trying to figure
out the whole Maldis and
Kyvan thing.

43:04.541 --> 43:07.032
Oh, no, no, look.
Zhaan laid that bit out for me.

43:07.127 --> 43:09.493
Okay, when Maldis
re-corporealized...

43:09.588 --> 43:10.373
Re-what?

43:10.464 --> 43:11.704
Well, put himself back together,

43:11.798 --> 43:13.413
he couldn't yet break through
to our physical plane,

43:13.508 --> 43:16.045
so he had to manipulate matter
to form Kyvan and her ship,

43:16.136 --> 43:18.593
and create the painting,
which would not only bridge
both realms,

43:18.680 --> 43:22.172
but also play on our fears which
would allow him to capture us

43:22.267 --> 43:24.258
and grow even stronger. Clear?

43:24.352 --> 43:26.013
Then, when Aeryn blasted Kyvan,

43:26.104 --> 43:28.015
which was actually just a
temporary extension of Maldis,

43:28.106 --> 43:31.098
it weakened Maldis enough for
Zhaan to make her move. Simple.

43:31.193 --> 43:32.182
But, why?

43:32.277 --> 43:34.689
I mean, how did Zhaan...

43:34.780 --> 43:38.022
(rueful chuckle)
Best not ponder questions
like these.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.402
They'll only make your
head hurt.

43:40.911 --> 43:42.026
Forget about it.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.202
Sit back and enjoy the
happy ending.

43:44.289 --> 43:45.995
What happy ending?

43:46.082 --> 43:49.324
My priceless Hynerian
tiara is gone.

43:49.419 --> 43:52.252
Vanished just like Kyvan
and her ship.

43:52.339 --> 43:55.206
Oh. Well, we can't have
everything, Ryg.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.086
I can't have anything.

43:57.177 --> 43:58.337
(laughing)

43:58.428 --> 43:59.133
Oh!

43:59.221 --> 44:01.177
(laughing)

44:07.062 --> 44:08.598
Crichton:
So, what do you think, Zhaan?

44:08.688 --> 44:11.930
Is that son of a bitch gone
for good this time?

44:12.025 --> 44:15.313
With a being like Maldis, we can
never be entirely certain.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.894
Zhaan,

44:17.989 --> 44:20.446
this would have been a really
good opportunity to lie to me.

44:20.534 --> 44:22.946
You know? Sure, John.

44:23.036 --> 44:25.402
He's toast. Strike him off
your Christmas list.

44:25.497 --> 44:28.409
Stick a fork in him. He's done.
He's over. The fat lady
is singing.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.617
It does not have to
be true, Zhaan.

44:31.711 --> 44:34.293
But I certainly would
have slept better.

44:34.381 --> 44:36.463
I'm sorry, John, I'm not
a very good liar.

44:36.550 --> 44:37.414
Yeah, right.

44:37.509 --> 44:39.090
( sarcastic chuckle )

44:39.177 --> 44:42.635
Now, I know you couldn't tell me
the truth about your ah, plan.

44:42.722 --> 44:45.338
Maldis would have picked it
out of my brain.

44:45.433 --> 44:48.391
But you had us all fooled with
that scared Nellie routine.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.683
My fear wasn't an act, John.

44:53.859 --> 44:56.100
You were really that scared?

44:58.196 --> 45:00.938
I've never been more scared
in my life.
