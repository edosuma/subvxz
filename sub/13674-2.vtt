WEBVTT

00:06.257 --> 00:08.122
(Drill buzzing, hammer banging)

00:08.259 --> 00:10.716
(J‘ Jazz music playing on radio)

00:10.845 --> 00:14.588
(Woman) You all have really made
a lot of progress.

00:14.724 --> 00:17.466
And I appreciate you working nights
and weekends

00:17.602 --> 00:19.467
to get this done before the holidays.

00:19.604 --> 00:21.469
(Man) Well, that was our promised date.

00:21.606 --> 00:23.437
(Woman) Can you get to the outbuildings?

00:23.566 --> 00:25.431
No reason not to.

00:27.445 --> 00:31.609
(Woman) We haven't done anything
in the back for, I don't know, 10 years.

00:31.741 --> 00:33.777
(Jeffy Jeff on radio)
That's good stuff, really.

00:33.910 --> 00:35.946
I mean, it reminds me of Woody Shaw
a bit, you know,

00:36.078 --> 00:37.784
Escape Velocity, that kind of stuff.

00:37.914 --> 00:40.951
Yeah, well, Woody was bringing
his head to Coltrane on Velocity.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.290
Us modern jazz cats
gotta come to Trane eventually.

00:43.419 --> 00:44.534
Yeah, no doubt, no doubt.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.833
I'm in the studio with New Orleans'
own Delmond Lambreaux.

00:47.965 --> 00:52.129
We're playing tracks from his new CD,
Walk-up, from Quartal Records.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.718
Um, any sense of how it's selling?

00:54.847 --> 00:56.178
Semng?

00:56.307 --> 00:58.468
(Chuckles) lt's jazz, man.

00:58.601 --> 01:01.809
Yeah, true that, but I'm hoping
it's finding an audience.

01:01.938 --> 01:04.805
I know a couple of smart, beautiful women
who got a copy.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.226
And I sent one to my father.

01:06.359 --> 01:10.193
So that's, like, three or four copies
I know about.

01:10.321 --> 01:12.232
Yeah, man, modern jazz is a lonely road.

01:12.365 --> 01:14.196
Um, speaking of your dad,

01:14.325 --> 01:16.987
who is, of course,
Big Chief Lambreaux of the Guardians,

01:17.119 --> 01:20.828
I know he made it back for
last St Joseph's night, made that walk,

01:20.957 --> 01:22.822
but is he home to stay?
How's he doing?

01:22.959 --> 01:25.792
He hanging in there. Hopefully
I'll get to see him tomorrow morning.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.785
I came straight from the airport
to catch the show.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.629
So your father's back in his house?

01:30.758 --> 01:33.545
Well, like most folks he's still waiting on
an insurance check.

01:33.678 --> 01:36.761
And now, I suppose, he's gonna be
waiting on Road Home money too.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.504
Yeah, I heard that.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.302
Well, we got time
for one more track.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.846
Anything you want to send out to anyone
before you roll?

01:42.979 --> 01:44.344
Well, since you brought him up,

01:44.480 --> 01:46.596
I wouldn't mind blowing a few notes
for my father

01:46.732 --> 01:48.723
on the off chance
he might be catching this.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.396
All right, all day long, Pop, ya heard?

01:51.529 --> 01:53.315
Yeah, brah.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.024
From the tradition, you know.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.900
Uh...

02:00.037 --> 02:02.870
This here is the first thing
my daddy taught me to play.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.411
(J‘ Playing Second Line)

02:12.883 --> 02:14.874
(J‘ Trumpet continues over radio)

02:24.520 --> 02:26.761
(Distant siren wailing)

04:14.630 --> 04:18.122
(Colson) Lastly, I want to refresh your memory
as to what it is that New Orleans police

04:18.259 --> 04:20.500
— are justifiably famous for.
- Uh-oh.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.173
I said famous, not infamous.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.931
This is a good thing.
This is something that we do right.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.970
Cool. Bring it, boss.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.640
Every day, every night,

04:31.772 --> 04:34.559
every minute in the life of this city,

04:34.692 --> 04:36.683
some asshat undergraduate

04:36.819 --> 04:38.855
from shit—for—brains state college,

04:38.988 --> 04:42.105
or some polyblend—wearing conventioneer
from Des Moines

04:42.241 --> 04:46.234
staggers out into the French Quarter
looking for rum and happiness.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.988
Three hours later, they're wearing
their own puke on Bourbon Street

04:50.124 --> 04:52.160
and waving beads
at some topless progeny

04:52.293 --> 04:53.703
from an Arkansas trailer park.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.076
(Laughter)

04:56.130 --> 04:58.416
Let Bourbon Street
be Bourbon Street,

04:58.549 --> 05:00.505
ladies and gentlemen.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.922
Because there is nothing there

05:04.054 --> 05:06.796
that requires our reform,

05:06.932 --> 05:09.423
short of, say, actual sex

05:09.560 --> 05:11.391
or human sacrifice in the street.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.726
(Laughter)

05:12.855 --> 05:14.686
His pants were at his fucking ankles.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.976
Understood, Officer Landry.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.610
And while the general rule of thumb

05:18.736 --> 05:21.273
is that topless walks
and bottomless gets the cuffs,

05:21.405 --> 05:23.566
I note from the incident report

05:23.699 --> 05:26.236
that the arrestee was
still wearing undershorts.

05:26.368 --> 05:29.075
You could see the crack of his ass, though.
They were slipping.

05:29.205 --> 05:32.743
Yes, and yet that tells me that our suspect,

05:32.875 --> 05:36.333
while he may have lost his pants
amid his misadventure,

05:36.462 --> 05:39.454
was not truly attempting
an act of fornication

05:39.590 --> 05:42.753
or self—pleasure on the street.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.502
In any other city of Christendom

05:46.639 --> 05:49.130
this man was indecently exposed,

05:49.266 --> 05:51.348
but in our bailiwick,

05:51.477 --> 05:54.935
he was, I will argue,
momentarily underdressed.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.600
(Laughter)

05:56.732 --> 06:00.395
I say again, let Bourbon Street
be Bourbon Street.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.483
And by all means avoid taking yourself
off the street

06:04.615 --> 06:07.448
with an arrest that
you can possibly duck.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.692
Got it, boss.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.613
— Anything else, Sergeant?
— You about covered it, sir.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.248
Have a safe shift.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.787
(Policemen) All right.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.503
You hear about Mike Hunter?

06:21.632 --> 06:23.668
Headquarters' rumor mill
has a grand jury

06:23.801 --> 06:26.759
going after him and the others
like he's lying about Danziger.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.627
Tshh.

06:28.764 --> 06:31.881
Yeah, Eddie Jordan's on the hunt, ain't he?

06:32.017 --> 06:33.882
Can't bring a damn murder case to court,

06:34.019 --> 06:37.102
but on this Danziger mess
he's right up our ass.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.310
Well, it's either him
or a runaway grand jury.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.433
For Christ's sakes, l was right there

06:42.570 --> 06:45.312
when the shoot—to—kill—looters order
came down to district commanders.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.483
"If you can sleep on it, you can do it,"

06:47.616 --> 06:49.231
that's what they told us.

06:49.368 --> 06:52.610
I know they put that out there
even if they won't admit it now.

06:53.706 --> 06:56.664
If it was a bad shoot, then why lie?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.040
All those guys have to do
is tell the grand jury

06:59.169 --> 07:02.297
we received that order
and they followed that order.

07:03.424 --> 07:07.633
Anything happened after that,
it might be bad police work, but it ain't illegal.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.174
The storm was a mess, you know?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.554
And I don't doubt that
some bad shit happened. ljust...

07:20.691 --> 07:22.852
But was there bad intent?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.153
We can't look back.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.736
We need to deal with
the here and now.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.198
We have dupes.
The Wild Tchoupitoulas.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.661
Mine's newer.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.912
We ditch yours.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.710
Negative. We ditch neither.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.675
See, this is you not believing
in the relationship.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.668
It's a telltale, Davis.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.797
If you don't get rid of dupes,
it means you're worried we're gonna split.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.594
See, this is where you are exactly wrong.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.810
Every household in New Orleans should have
two copies of The Wild Tchoupitoulas.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.974
— What if one gets scratched up?
— We buy another.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.723
And go without it for how long?
What if it's the middle of the night?

08:04.860 --> 08:09.695
What if we're having a party, it's 2am,
and we need to hear Meet De Boys?

08:09.823 --> 08:11.814
Are you willing to take that risk?

08:12.743 --> 08:14.449
Didn't think so.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.783
Why is Kermit Ruffins in the R&B pile?

08:18.916 --> 08:21.828
— Shouldn't it be with the jazz stuff?
— That's not the R&B pile.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.918
That is musicians
who I don't like or get along with.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.628
You love Kermit.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.123
Derrick Freeman
has been a dick to me.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.716
So 'cause you don't get along with
Kermit's drummer,

08:31.845 --> 08:35.429
you're gonna file Kermit's stuff
under musicians you don't like?

08:38.811 --> 08:39.926
OK.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.552
So if I want to find
your advance copy

08:41.689 --> 08:44.226
of Kermit Ruffins and the Barbeque Swingers,
Live At Vaughan's,

08:44.358 --> 08:47.225
l have to first remember that you and Derrick
are pissy with each other?

08:47.361 --> 08:49.192
Yeah.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.482
(Laughs) You...

08:51.615 --> 08:54.402
— What?
— You are such a freak.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.524
You are.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.777
(Laughs) You are.

09:04.795 --> 09:07.912
- Who's out there?
— A walk—in. A man had your name.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.754
I told you no new clients.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.670
It's not like he asked for
an appointment or anything.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.134
It looks worse.

09:14.263 --> 09:16.504
It is worse. I've been working for three days,

09:16.640 --> 09:19.473
and now this place
is officially unusable.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.183
I need a new office
to get away from my new office.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.724
— Hi. I'm Toni Bernette.
— Hi.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.688
Vincent Abreu.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.479
Look, I'm not sure what I can do
for you right now,

09:29.611 --> 09:31.772
given that we're just getting situated

09:31.905 --> 09:34.487
and I'm really in no position to
take on new clients right now.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.447
I saw your name in the paper. Um...

09:36.577 --> 09:38.442
The shootings on the bridge.

09:38.579 --> 09:42.037
— The Danziger Bridge, right.
— You're the lawyer in that?

09:42.166 --> 09:44.327
I represent one of the victims' families, yes.

09:44.460 --> 09:47.122
Did you have something to do with
the Danziger case?

09:47.254 --> 09:49.996
No, no. Uh, my son.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.338
Your son?

09:51.467 --> 09:52.707
Joseph. Joey.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.630
He's dead. In the storm.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.845
I'm very sorry to hear that.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.260
Everybody says something different,

10:01.393 --> 10:03.224
which is the reason
I came down here.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.763
And now that I'm here,

10:04.897 --> 10:07.764
everyone wants to send me
somewhere else.

10:10.694 --> 10:15.028
Give me a few minutes to clear off my desk
and we'll go back in the office.

10:17.785 --> 10:20.026
(J‘ Song playing softly on jukebox)

10:22.831 --> 10:24.867
(Men chatting, laughing)

10:31.089 --> 10:32.954
Hey, Delmond.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.006
Poke.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.297
Shit.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.384
Taxi!

10:43.352 --> 10:44.808
Shit.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.183
Damn.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.729
Well, first we get a call from Louisiana police
saying that he was dead.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.362
Nothing else, really,

10:54.488 --> 10:56.695
just they found Joey dead
after the storm.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.610
And they told you when?

10:58.742 --> 11:02.860
Ah, September last year. I call the number
they gave me for the mortuary people.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.783
They tell me how to handle Joey —
what's left of him —

11:05.916 --> 11:10.285
because turns out he was kind of
left on the ground for a while.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.621
Um, so we do what we have to do,

11:13.757 --> 11:15.964
bring him home — Massachusetts.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.425
When did your son come down here?

11:18.554 --> 11:22.718
He came down here with friends
four years ago, uh...

11:22.850 --> 11:24.556
for a festival or something.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.643
They came back, he stayed.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.352
A shame.

11:31.984 --> 11:34.145
You know, Mr. Abreu,

11:34.278 --> 11:37.941
there was so much not accounted for
after the storm.

11:38.073 --> 11:40.860
It's entirely possible,
even understandable,

11:40.993 --> 11:43.735
that no one knows
what happened to your son.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.953
Mm—hm. Well, so they tell me a year ago.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.617
But that didn't sit right with us.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.286
Well, my wife, really.
She wanted to know more.

11:50.419 --> 11:53.456
So a month ago
I call back the mortuary,

11:53.589 --> 11:55.625
get his name as the cop to talk to.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.923
Detective Dennis Prioleau.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.043
Yeah, or however you pronounce it.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.717
I call him five, six times.
He don't call back.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.307
Finally a sergeant calls.
I forgot the name.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.347
He says,
"We don't know anything.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.970
"Joey's body was found on the street
and that's it."

12:13.400 --> 12:17.734
Detective Prioleau's one of the better guys
in Homicide, as far as I know.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.445
But here's the thing,
I call the sergeant and l...

12:20.574 --> 12:23.441
l—l say, "What's the street that Joey died on?"

12:23.577 --> 12:27.411
And he can't even give...
He won't even give me it.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.656
I mean, come on, you can't tell me
where my son died, for Christ's sake?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.748
I keep calling.
I ask to speak to the supervisor.

12:32.878 --> 12:37.121
Then this Prioleau guy, he calls.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.795
He says Marais or Moreau Street
was where Joey was found.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.634
"Oh, and, hey, your son was killed..."

12:42.763 --> 12:45.846
- (Phone rings)
— "..by the other looters."

12:45.974 --> 12:48.090
- That's...
— (Myers) Law office. How may I help you?

12:48.226 --> 12:49.602
..what he says to me.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.093
(Myers) I'll need to check on that.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.561
"Killed by other looters"?
He said that?

12:53.690 --> 12:57.023
"Mr. Abreu, your son was
killed by other looters

12:57.152 --> 13:00.269
"and we're never gonna
find out who did it."

13:01.323 --> 13:04.235
Look, if Joey was doing stuff
that he wasn't supposed to

13:04.368 --> 13:08.782
and something happened that shouldn't've,
it is what it is.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.905
Just give me the whole story.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.601
When were you thinking
you were gonna tell me

13:36.733 --> 13:38.348
Poke came back and put y'all out the bar?

13:38.485 --> 13:39.986
Nice to see you too.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.653
You staying here?

13:43.782 --> 13:45.989
Nowhere else to hang my hat.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.325
We got the house
pretty well cleaned out,

13:48.453 --> 13:50.569
tarp over the bad part of the roof.

13:50.706 --> 13:52.367
This is crazy.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.785
The bar was one thing,
but this went from bad to worse.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.034
Oh, don't fret none.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.876
Now the insurance money's landed,

13:59.006 --> 14:00.997
we'll have this place fixed up in no time.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.249
You got the insurance check?

14:10.684 --> 14:12.549
$495.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.971
And no cents.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.594
Even after you wrote that appeal?

14:15.731 --> 14:17.847
Even after you took it
to the insurance commissioner?

14:17.983 --> 14:20.725
They're paying for the carport only —
wind damage.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.479
Are you gonna cash that?

14:25.615 --> 14:28.357
| feel like if I do,

14:28.493 --> 14:30.950
I'm saying it's all right
what they're doing.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.586
Linda.

14:42.591 --> 14:43.831
Desiree!

14:43.967 --> 14:45.082
(Both laugh)

14:45.218 --> 14:46.674
Girl, you working here?

14:46.803 --> 14:48.634
Since August. You back in Fortier?

14:48.764 --> 14:50.925
Girl, please. You know they let everybody go.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.014
Didn't even try to sort
the good from the bad,

14:53.143 --> 14:54.758
— just put us all on the street.
— I know it.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.102
Every damn public school teacher
in Orleans Parish.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.606
— Uh—huh.
— I'll tell you, though,

14:58.732 --> 15:00.063
they ain't chasing me away.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.023
I came back to vote,
made sure of that.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.143
— Amen.
— Wasn't teachers taking that money.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.816
— School board.
— Then bust the damn school board.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.484
That's what the FBI looking at,

15:08.617 --> 15:10.232
not the teachers' union.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.327
But why hire one of me when you can get
two of them for the same price?

15:17.459 --> 15:19.700
— They any good?
— Bright—eyed and bushy—tailed.

15:19.836 --> 15:20.746
(Both laugh)

15:20.879 --> 15:22.494
Are you coming back to teach here?

15:22.631 --> 15:24.542
Gotta take a test.
Can you believe that?

15:24.674 --> 15:26.926
13 years in the classroom,
Teacher Of The Year twice,

15:27.052 --> 15:29.464
and I gotta take a goddamn test
to come back and start over.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.632
Tell me about it.
Lost all my seniority too.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.051
Gotta scoot, girl,
go take this damn thing.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.264
How's your baby?

15:35.393 --> 15:37.805
Good when | see her.
She's with my mom all day while I'm here.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.553
At least you got that. Bye.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.816
Bye, Linda.
Hope you end up here.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.064
(Sirens wailing)

16:03.421 --> 16:05.707
Hey, you were in New Orleans, right?

16:05.841 --> 16:07.502
New Orleans, yeah.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.797
Right, well, you're gonna read this
and go batshit.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.840
This guy leveled your town.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.760
He's ripping the chefs,
the food, everything.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.687
Alan Richman? He ripped us?

16:19.813 --> 16:21.644
(Grill man) He's like the dean of food writing.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.640
The fucker's got, like,
six million Beard awards.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.728
Holy shit.

16:29.865 --> 16:33.357
I can't believe it.
He's not just ripping the food. Check it out.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.701
"New Orleans was always
a three—day stubble of a city.

16:36.830 --> 16:40.197
"I'm not certain the cuisine
was ever as good as its reputation

16:40.333 --> 16:44.292
"in part because the people who consumed,
evaluated and admired it

16:44.421 --> 16:47.208
"likely weren't sober enough
at the time of ingestion

16:47.340 --> 16:48.750
"to know what they were eating."

16:48.884 --> 16:50.624
— Whoa.
— (Janette) Fuck me.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.547
"Supposedly Creoles can be found
in and around New Orleans.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.298
"l have never met one and suspect
they're a fairy folk like leprechauns."

16:57.434 --> 17:00.176
— (Man) Fairy folk. That's some funny shit.
— That's kind of harsh.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.519
Richman is a serious guy.
That's gonna get a lot of play.

17:02.647 --> 17:06.515
Oh, great. Now he goes on to trash
Susan Spicer and...

17:06.651 --> 17:08.516
And Donald Link?

17:08.653 --> 17:10.860
Donald Link is a fucking hero.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.315
Donald Link was, like,
one of the first guys back,

17:14.451 --> 17:17.409
standing there serving free food in the street.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.949
I mean, holy shit.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.787
The town's just barely on its feet

17:21.917 --> 17:24.408
and this son of a bitch
has got to come down

17:24.544 --> 17:27.160
and reevaluate whether
we were ever any good,

17:27.297 --> 17:30.710
make fucking batter—as—entree jokes?
Yeah, we heard 'em.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.424
(Grill man) The guy's got a point about
the cooking down there.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.420
— Last time l was in New Orleans, it was like...
— Fine, fine.

17:36.556 --> 17:40.925
He doesn't like the food. He thinks it's heavy
or he thinks it's shit. I don't care.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.393
But for fuck's sake,
it's a service economy.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.307
They're fucking hurting.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.396
He's got to write this now,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.937
tell people to stay away
from New Orleans,

17:50.070 --> 17:53.688
don't come down,
don't spend your money in restaurants?

17:55.283 --> 17:56.898
Do not cry.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.198
We're gonna be together
for Thanksgiving dinner.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.616
I miss you too, jelly roll.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.206
OK, OK. You stop crying,

18:05.335 --> 18:06.871
I'll stop calling you jelly roll.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.994
l'm—a see you soon.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.844
Mm. Thank you.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.431
— Gonna be a dead night again.
- Mm.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.476
Too many dead nights in here.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.395
Not enough people home.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.941
Barbecue on Thursday
is bringing in some folks.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.442
Turkey necks on Tuesday sure ain't.

18:41.329 --> 18:45.368
I'm thinking maybe live music.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.580
Upside and a downside to it, though.

18:49.713 --> 18:51.578
What's the downside?

18:51.715 --> 18:53.580
Musicians.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.668
J‘ Well, I saw my baby walking

18:58.722 --> 19:01.213
J‘ With another man today

19:02.475 --> 19:05.558
J‘ Yeah, I saw my baby walking

19:06.396 --> 19:08.557
J‘ With another man today

19:09.607 --> 19:12.269
J‘ When I asked her,
"What's the matter, baby?"

19:13.153 --> 19:16.316
J‘ This is what she got to say

19:16.448 --> 19:19.736
J‘ See you later, alligator

19:19.868 --> 19:22.234
J‘ After a while, crocodile

19:23.246 --> 19:26.659
J‘ See you later, alligator, yeah... J‘

19:28.168 --> 19:30.534
Hey, brah, put it back.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.126
Put it back.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.045
(Woman) Hey.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.839
Hey!

19:39.971 --> 19:42.178
- Hey!
— After a while, crocodile!

19:42.307 --> 19:44.423
Hey!

19:48.730 --> 19:50.937
Gotta get off the fucking streets, man.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.523
(J‘ Playing When I Die)

19:55.362 --> 19:57.148
How did you hear about him?

19:57.280 --> 20:00.647
| asked where to hear some good music.
A simple question.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.901
He's fucking great.
When he does that thing with that one eye...

20:04.037 --> 20:05.322
Man, that kills me.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.322
All this time you've been here, cuz,
and you ain't never been here?

20:08.458 --> 20:10.414
I'm working.

20:11.294 --> 20:12.909
J‘ You'd better second line

20:13.046 --> 20:14.911
J‘ Second line

20:15.048 --> 20:18.006
J‘ You'd better strike up the band
every day of the week

20:18.134 --> 20:21.001
J‘ Parade my soul
up and down these streets

20:21.137 --> 20:23.298
J‘ When I die

20:23.431 --> 20:25.638
J‘ You'd better second line

20:25.767 --> 20:29.305
— J‘ You'd better second line

J‘ You'd better second line J‘

20:37.612 --> 20:40.228
(Cheering and applause)

20:45.161 --> 20:47.197
Thank you, music lovers.
Thank you.

20:47.330 --> 20:51.664
Now we've got a brief message
from one of our elected officials —

20:51.793 --> 20:54.034
Congressman Jefferson in the house!

20:55.672 --> 20:58.209
Thank you, Kermit.
Thank you, Kermit.

20:58.341 --> 21:02.084
I'll just be a moment to thank you
for your support in the general election

21:02.220 --> 21:04.802
and to remind all of you we have a runoff
coming up next month.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.765
And what's at stake is whether we get
to come home to our New Orleans.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.270
You know, my opponent
supports the green—dot plan

21:11.396 --> 21:13.762
— to get rid of some of our communities.
— (Crowd jeering)

21:13.898 --> 21:17.482
You know where I stand.
So I need you all to come out to the polls...

21:17.610 --> 21:19.646
— (Man) I'm not going anywhere.
- ..on December 9th

21:19.779 --> 21:21.189
and make Orleans Parish heard.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.654
— Thank you.
- (Cheering)

21:28.079 --> 21:30.411
— (Kermit) You think Jefferson gonna win?
- Oh yeah, brah.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.246
— I don't know, brah.
- Oh.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.661
What, because of the Feds? Please.

21:34.794 --> 21:38.707
Like you never forgot about $90,000
in your fucking freezer.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.001
- (Both laugh)
— Can I do this one right here, brah?

21:41.134 --> 21:43.341
Yeah, you want to do it?
Go ahead.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.961
— J‘ I got a woman
— Oh!

21:46.097 --> 21:47.883
J‘ Way across town

21:48.016 --> 21:49.677
J‘ That's good to me

21:50.852 --> 21:52.308
J‘ Oh yeah

21:53.480 --> 21:55.596
J‘ I got a woman

21:55.732 --> 21:57.893
J‘ Way across town

21:58.026 --> 22:00.563
J‘ That's good to me

22:00.695 --> 22:02.902
J‘ Oh yeah... J‘

22:03.031 --> 22:05.022
(Train rumbling and clattering)

22:17.921 --> 22:21.209
(Announcer) Smith and 9th Street station,
the final stop for the G train.

22:21.341 --> 22:24.299
Transfer available for
the Coney Island final F train.

22:24.427 --> 22:27.009
— This is the last station stop.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

22:27.138 --> 22:30.505
J‘ I got a woman
way across town

22:30.642 --> 22:32.303
J‘ That's good to me... J‘

22:32.435 --> 22:33.971
You blaspheming Ray Charles now?

22:34.103 --> 22:37.061
Oh, baby, you should have seen me last night.
I killed them dead.

22:37.190 --> 22:39.397
l fronted that one
and a couple of others —

22:39.526 --> 22:41.062
Lee Dorsey,
James Brown even.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.277
You doing James Brown?
I'm actually sorry I missed that.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.316
Last night it really started getting good to me.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.735
I got enough flex
I can start my own band, you know.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.983
You?

22:50.119 --> 22:52.781
Antoine Batiste And His Soul Apostles.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.370
— Soul Apostles?
— Mm—hm.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.205
I'm out. I got groceries to make.

22:56.334 --> 22:59.076
I might meet you downtown with the baby.
Gonna go see some people.

22:59.212 --> 23:01.624
— You ain't meeting me.
— Why not? You ain't got school today.

23:01.756 --> 23:04.088
No school, but tonight is parents' night,
remember?

23:04.217 --> 23:05.297
Aw hell, Desiree.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.338
I don't like it any more than you — a bunch
of bake sales and teacher conferences

23:08.471 --> 23:11.588
for a bunch of parents
who never bother to show up.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.806
Bye—bye, pookie.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.972
And later for the not—so—hardest—working man
in show business.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.811
That's sex machine to you, girl.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.272
— I'm sure.
- Mm-hm.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.392
(J‘ Keyboard playing)

23:26.656 --> 23:29.363
(J‘ Professor Longhair: Big Chief
on keyboard)

23:55.685 --> 23:58.552
I'm told it's not even a homicide.
DMORT pended it.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.304
Fine if they did,
but here's the problem.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.147
This guy is sitting up in Massachusetts

24:03.276 --> 24:05.642
getting different information
from different people

24:05.778 --> 24:07.894
who probably don't know
what they're talking about.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.192
The guy's bouncing off the walls.

24:10.325 --> 24:13.783
So he drives down here just looking for
someone to talk to him.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.036
So talk to him, OK?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.033
Who was the detective on it?

24:22.170 --> 24:23.535
Prioleau.

24:23.671 --> 24:24.911
I'll give him a call.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.004
I appreciate it.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.340
You know, the horn section
gonna be moving together.

24:29.469 --> 24:33.428
And they're gonna be in powder—blue tuxes,
you know, shawl collar, like this...

24:33.556 --> 24:35.547
(Humming a tune)

24:37.143 --> 24:38.974
(Plays the tune)

24:39.103 --> 24:40.263
Yeah.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.387
I like that shit right there.

24:44.192 --> 24:47.480
I'm talking old school, man, the kind of shit
that'd make Johnnie Taylor proud...

24:47.612 --> 24:49.944
- Yeah.
— Make Solomon Burke give praise.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.029
— Yeah, you feel me?
— | feel you.

24:52.158 --> 24:56.401
(Mimics trombone)

24:56.537 --> 24:58.152
Music that don't get played no more,

24:58.289 --> 25:01.201
but people wish they did,
because you can shake your ass to it.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.325
Yeah. Mm.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.459
Mm—hm.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.624
Ow! Girl!

25:08.508 --> 25:11.420
With a band like this, I think we can hold down
a couple of weeklies.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.838
- That many? Oh.
— Yeah, that many.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.222
Oh, I don't know, Batiste.

25:15.348 --> 25:18.556
— You know I got my own gigs now.
— And you can keep those.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.301
But I can't do a gig like this
without a woman's voice.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.769
You can't do a full-out revue
and fill it with just Otis and Pickett.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.684
Gotta have Carla Thomas too, right?

25:25.817 --> 25:28.650
Gotta get a woman's voice
up in there for balance.

25:28.778 --> 25:31.315
— How much?
— Oh, Wanda, come on.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.732
(Laughing)

25:32.865 --> 25:34.651
I don't get it.
What's in Baton Rouge?

25:34.784 --> 25:36.740
A joint field office for FEMA.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.076
— Who do you know at FEMA?
- A friend of a friend.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.663
I should be out on a job with my crew
on a roof somewhere.

25:42.792 --> 25:43.781
That's why I called you.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.954
I thought you were gonna come here
and back me on my roofing gig.

25:46.087 --> 25:48.669
Big picture, cuz, big picture.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.634
I don't take no money from my children.
You know this.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.502
It's a loan, Daddy.
You'll pay me back.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.300
I got money coming in
from the new CD.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.843
I got tour dates lined up.

25:59.976 --> 26:01.967
You selling jazz now, huh?

26:03.438 --> 26:05.144
All right, so between
my sisters and me...

26:05.273 --> 26:09.812
No, I'm doing this right here
so that we can have dinner like you want.

26:10.528 --> 26:11.643
Like I want?

26:11.779 --> 26:14.065
If it was like I want,
we'd be in Houston at Davina's,

26:14.198 --> 26:15.779
or in Atlanta with Cheri and the kids.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.821
You think I want to be having Thanksgiving
out in the damn driveway?

26:19.954 --> 26:21.569
You ever meet a man so stubborn?

26:21.706 --> 26:24.448
We'll get his water turned back up,

26:24.584 --> 26:27.417
providing we can ass—kiss some inspector
to give the OK.

26:28.212 --> 26:32.455
I know you're tired of me coming over
to your house to clean up.

26:32.592 --> 26:35.629
Turn my soap all gray,
use up all my damn towels.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.718
Why would I be tired of that?

26:37.847 --> 26:39.587
(J‘ Mary Ann playing on jukebox)

26:39.724 --> 26:42.682
Acting all sweetness and light
now that you're with your mother,

26:42.810 --> 26:45.768
but they fought like cats and dogs
in the back seat the whole way down.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.555
I thought about leaving one of them
at a gas station in LaPlace.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.774
Couldn't decide which, though.

26:51.903 --> 26:55.612
Alcide, don't be hiding
them greens under the rice.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.696
I know that trick.

26:58.409 --> 27:02.197
Ma, is this gonna be the last Thanksgiving
at Grandma's for real?

27:02.330 --> 27:05.288
I can't imagine Grandma
in any other house.

27:10.338 --> 27:12.169
Not a lot of traffic.

27:13.925 --> 27:17.042
I'm thinking about getting
some live music up in here,

27:17.178 --> 27:20.136
bring out more folks
on the weekdays.

27:22.725 --> 27:25.216
As I said, New Orleans kicked it back to us,

27:25.353 --> 27:28.470
we kicked it to the Corps of Engineers
and they kicked on to the contractors.

27:28.606 --> 27:32.144
What you need comes directly
from the contractors or one of their subs.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.938
The money is the lowest at this point.

27:35.988 --> 27:39.105
Understood, but I was told
to introduce myself here

27:39.242 --> 27:43.201
and that a call might be made on my behalf
to one of the contractors.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.115
A phone call's no problem.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.658
That's good.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.201
I suppose it is.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.497
Uh, look, give me a day or two on my end,

27:51.629 --> 27:54.086
call this fella in Florida.

27:55.132 --> 27:58.545
There shouldn't be any issue going fonNard.
lt'll all flow through them.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.339
And, uh...

28:00.471 --> 28:03.133
give my best wishes to your friend.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.222
— Thank you.
- Yeah.

28:07.812 --> 28:09.928
We're subcontractors.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.476
Under Riley's license,
we're already that.

28:12.608 --> 28:16.066
Oh, would you fuck
the nickel—and—dime roofing jobs already?

28:16.195 --> 28:18.982
| just pulled a $200,000 contract

28:19.115 --> 28:21.106
for demolition and debris removal.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.028
We're gonna need four crews with trucks

28:23.160 --> 28:25.867
to do three, maybe three and a half
city blocks a week.

28:25.997 --> 28:29.455
Fuck you know about
demolition and debris removal?

28:29.584 --> 28:31.916
I know P&J Incorporated out of Florida.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.296
I call this number, tell them we got the trucks,

28:34.422 --> 28:35.502
we're ready to roll.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.882
They're my hookup.

28:37.008 --> 28:39.875
We don't got trucks,
crews either.

28:40.011 --> 28:44.630
Rocky, do you believe
America is a land of opportunity?

28:45.933 --> 28:48.675
— (Mimics Rocky Balboa) Yeah.
- (Laughs)

28:50.271 --> 28:54.731
(Man) That we're still having trouble with
our bus routes is frustrating, I know.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.851
(Man 2) In September it was frustrating,
but now it's just ridiculous.

28:57.987 --> 29:00.820
And are you gonna tell us that this school
is having a hard time

29:00.948 --> 29:03.109
securing hand soap and toilet paper
in November?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.528
It has not been perfect,
not at this school,

29:05.661 --> 29:07.367
or any of the other charters,

29:07.496 --> 29:10.033
and certainly not in the recovery school district.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.373
Everyone is dealing
with the same issues.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.536
Yes, ma'am.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.660
My concern is the classroom.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.878
It's my understanding
that your geometry classes

29:18.007 --> 29:19.463
still not giving out any homework

29:19.592 --> 29:22.334
'cause there aren't enough
take-home textbooks.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.176
(Man) Thank you, baby, thank you.

29:25.014 --> 29:28.256
They thought it was gonna be cake when
they laid off the whole damn school system?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.804
Look at them now,
wondering why everything is messed up.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.973
Yeah, there's one thing different, though.

29:33.105 --> 29:38.099
You ever seen this many parents
at a parents' night? I mean ever?

29:38.235 --> 29:40.362
(Distant siren wailing)

30:01.467 --> 30:03.207
Sof?

30:03.344 --> 30:05.380
Sweetie?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.218
Soﬁa?

30:18.985 --> 30:20.976
(Cell phone ringing)

30:25.324 --> 30:26.825
(Beep, ringing stops)

30:34.500 --> 30:39.244
I want to do it. You know I love that
Muscle Shoals—Stax stuff, man.

30:39.380 --> 30:40.586
I'd love to be a part of it.

30:40.715 --> 30:41.921
Well, cool, then.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.916
When I told Bennie,
he bucked on me, you know.

30:45.052 --> 30:48.135
Got mad having someone to fill for me
while I'm gigging with y'all.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.630
It's been hard on Bennie
trying to hold the band together.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.472
And I'd hate to add to that.
You feel me?

30:52.601 --> 30:54.933
— OK, well, I'll talk to Bennie.
- Cool.

30:55.062 --> 30:58.520
(Man on microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, Mem Shannon.

31:00.818 --> 31:03.400
— You gonna sit in?
— No, ljust come to hear Mem do his set.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.941
- You know I love his stuff.
— Well, I'm gonna roll home, me.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.984
- Be cool.
— Be safe.

31:18.878 --> 31:21.961
J‘ They say if I eat right,
ride my bike

31:22.089 --> 31:23.920
J‘ l'll bejust the right size

31:24.050 --> 31:27.133
- J‘ For my height
— (Cell phone ringing)

31:28.220 --> 31:30.882
J‘ They say,
get yourself an education

31:31.015 --> 31:34.052
J‘ That will help improve
yoursﬂuaﬂonu.I

31:36.437 --> 31:39.144
(lndistinct chatter)

31:43.652 --> 31:45.688
(Woman) Table 7, Chef.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.525
They're getting up to leave.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.233
Let them go.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.820
— I'm thinking.
— (Saucier) You got duck for me, right?

31:55.956 --> 31:57.821
(Grill man) Yeah, I have two.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.165
Please, not me, not me.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.792
(Man) All right, I need more rectangle plates.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.462
(Man 2) Rectangle plates going out.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.835
(Man) Can you grab an oval plate
from over there?

32:10.971 --> 32:12.347
(Man 2) Yes, Chef.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.651
(lndistinct order)

32:25.861 --> 32:27.567
(Man) Right away, Chef.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.534
You know...

32:36.789 --> 32:41.032
the salmon can be a beautiful animal,

32:41.168 --> 32:42.999
wild, free.

32:43.838 --> 32:45.544
Honor his death.

32:45.673 --> 32:47.459
Listen to him.

32:48.425 --> 32:51.258
You rush him to the pan...
you're destroying him.

32:51.387 --> 32:54.094
You're squeezing out proteins, flavor,

32:54.223 --> 32:56.088
everything,

32:56.225 --> 32:59.388
the vital substance
that makes him what he is.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.727
You don't want to do that, do you?

33:02.398 --> 33:05.105
Of course not. Of course not.

33:08.070 --> 33:09.810
Slow down.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.403
Listen to your fish.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.324
(Phone bleeps)

33:59.079 --> 34:00.660
(Ringing tone)

34:33.239 --> 34:34.820
(Man) Coming down the line.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.276
Pick up table 12.

34:40.412 --> 34:43.028
They're gone, Chef.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.341
I'll bet I could get Cheeky.

34:55.469 --> 34:58.381
Cheeky Blakk?
Is this for the latest incarnation?

34:58.514 --> 35:00.880
DJ Davis And His Bounce Brass Funkateers.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.268
No boundaries, no limits,
no quarter given.

35:03.394 --> 35:06.010
(Chuckles) Are you on guitar or keyboards?

35:06.146 --> 35:09.309
A little of both, an all—purpose Svengali,
if you will.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.056
He was evil, you know.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.275
— Who?
— Svengali.

35:13.404 --> 35:15.315
In the novel he was evil.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.153
He manipulated Trilby.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.865
There is a novel? Who's Trilby?

35:22.371 --> 35:25.659
For Thanksgiving tonight,
we should go to Popeye's,

35:25.791 --> 35:27.952
get the deep—fried turkey.

35:28.085 --> 35:31.543
I can't help it, I gotta know
if it's as good as people say.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.378
What do you mean?

35:33.507 --> 35:36.294
l'm, um, due at my parents' house.

35:37.219 --> 35:39.050
It's a yearly ritual.

35:40.139 --> 35:43.222
— So I'm on my own for Thanksgiving.
- No, it's not like that.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.055
You don't want me at your folks' house,
just say so.

35:47.187 --> 35:50.679
Annie, my family is...

35:52.276 --> 35:53.732
dystopic, that's the word.

35:53.861 --> 35:56.352
They're... They're... (Sighs)

35:56.488 --> 35:58.399
They can't be that bad.

35:58.532 --> 36:01.865
I introduced a girl to them once
and only once.

36:01.994 --> 36:03.029
How'd that go?

36:03.162 --> 36:04.652
She now resides out of state.

36:06.123 --> 36:07.329
How far out of state?

36:10.169 --> 36:12.160
(Alarm buzzing)

36:17.926 --> 36:21.214
— Good morning.
— Oh, I gotta pull it together.

36:22.139 --> 36:25.051
(Sighs) I gotta get to work.

36:26.977 --> 36:28.763
There's probably coffee set up.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.932
Just push the button.

36:36.779 --> 36:38.770
Bullwinkle!

36:38.906 --> 36:41.067
(lnhales) Bullwinkle.

36:42.618 --> 36:45.360
— Bullwinkle!
— (Laughing)

36:46.705 --> 36:50.038
Hey, he's a pilot.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.123
Look at his hat.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.038
Hey, I'm Rick, Rick the pilot.

36:54.171 --> 36:56.412
I ride on a giant moose.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.584
(Both laugh)

36:58.717 --> 37:01.629
- Hey, check it out.
— Because he floats.

37:01.762 --> 37:06.176
I'm like Amelia Earhart on this moose
with my weird fucking goggles and...

37:08.018 --> 37:11.101
Which is weird, right, because by the '70s...

37:11.230 --> 37:12.265
You gotta go?

37:12.398 --> 37:14.514
Yeah, got something I gotta do.

37:14.650 --> 37:15.981
— I love a parade.
— I know.

37:16.110 --> 37:19.898
— Look at his teeth. He still looks stupid.
- No, man. It's 'cause he's a beaver.

37:20.030 --> 37:23.147
How can you not be happy
if you're a fucking beaver?

37:24.284 --> 37:27.276
Let me guess, out of papers?

37:27.413 --> 37:28.528
Yeah.

37:28.664 --> 37:29.995
But it's good this way.

37:30.124 --> 37:32.285
Do you know what's cool
about this dish?

37:32.418 --> 37:33.498
lt's interactive.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.618
Like when you're really stoned,

37:35.754 --> 37:38.040
is that light pink color in the milk

37:38.173 --> 37:41.506
from food coloring
on the Crunch Berries,

37:41.635 --> 37:45.002
or is it your own blood
from the crunch itself

37:45.139 --> 37:47.721
cutting the shit out of the roof of your mouth?

37:47.850 --> 37:49.511
What's cool about that, though,

37:49.643 --> 37:53.602
is that your blood is like
a basic component of this dish,

37:53.730 --> 37:56.437
part of the basic flavor profile,

37:56.567 --> 37:59.354
like, uh, ortolan, you know,

37:59.486 --> 38:01.943
when the tiny bones prick your gums.

38:02.072 --> 38:07.317
In that way, one would say that the Cap'n
falls into a classic tradition

38:07.453 --> 38:09.239
going back to the Romans.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.450
Toni, it's not like
I won't help you out when I can,

38:12.583 --> 38:14.574
but when did I become the go—to guy

38:14.710 --> 38:17.497
whenever you can't pry a report
out of an NOPD unit?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.415
I don't even need a report.

38:19.548 --> 38:22.039
I don't need anything from anybody
but to call this guy

38:22.176 --> 38:25.464
and tell him where his son was found dead
and what's known.

38:25.596 --> 38:26.881
That's all he wants.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.629
And you went to the PIO, right?

38:28.765 --> 38:31.928
Yeah, and they came back with a no—comment,
saying the case is still pending.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.802
But that's bullshit.
No one's working this.

38:42.404 --> 38:45.988
lf Prioleau finds out
that | asked into this case,

38:46.116 --> 38:47.652
he's gonna know I'm your bitch.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.570
(Laughs)

38:54.541 --> 38:57.374
(J‘ Trumpet plays fanfare)

39:08.555 --> 39:11.547
I'll be damned. I saw that same guy
play trumpet the other night

39:11.683 --> 39:13.639
at this little club way out
from the French Quarter.

39:13.769 --> 39:15.475
You're learning the town, I see.

39:15.604 --> 39:18.767
Oh, I'm loving the town,
what's left of it anyway.

39:18.899 --> 39:21.515
A lot needs to be done still.

39:21.652 --> 39:23.483
Your man in Baton Rouge
made it easy.

39:23.612 --> 39:26.274
I'm hooked into one of the big contractors,
the one in Florida.

39:26.406 --> 39:28.192
Well, thank you right back
for sponsoring

39:28.325 --> 39:30.987
the stained—glass repairs
at St Alphonsus.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.279
And thank you, I assume,

39:32.412 --> 39:35.745
for banking whatever comes to you
at Southeast Louisiana Bank and Trust.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.660
You don't even need to bring it up.

39:37.793 --> 39:40.660
I once put in a good word for someone
on a gaming license

39:40.796 --> 39:43.503
and the sumbitch set up
his corporate accounts at Chase.

39:43.632 --> 39:46.715
Well, ingratitude is not among my faults.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.583
So, second race —
who do you like?

39:48.720 --> 39:50.631
— Oh, I never gamble.
— No?

39:50.764 --> 39:53.471
- Mm-mm.
— I imagine you don't.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.517
What's next?

39:57.646 --> 40:00.262
I raised as much as I could in Dallas
for your girl Carter,

40:00.399 --> 40:02.606
though I'm not sure
it's gonna do much good.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.110
What do you mean?

40:04.236 --> 40:06.352
In that club the other night
listening to Kermit,

40:06.488 --> 40:08.353
Bill Jefferson came in
and worked the crowd,

40:08.490 --> 40:10.355
tarred your girl
with supporting green—dot.

40:10.492 --> 40:14.201
(Announcer) The field approaching the gate
for race two. At six furlongs, the track is fast...

40:14.329 --> 40:17.241
Yeah, even with a federal investigation,

40:17.374 --> 40:19.239
Dollar Bill might pull it out.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.411
Remarkable.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.751
Yeah.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.871
(lndistinct commentary over PA)

40:28.176 --> 40:30.588
So, looking ahead,

40:30.721 --> 40:33.133
what else might I do
to bring us some good?

40:33.265 --> 40:35.677
Well, statewide everybody could see

40:35.809 --> 40:38.016
Blanco's numbers have tumbled
since the storm.

40:38.145 --> 40:42.309
And the guy who might be our best option
is Bobby Jindal, Indian fella.

40:42.441 --> 40:43.772
lndian like...

40:43.900 --> 40:45.515
(Muted war whoop)

40:45.652 --> 40:47.517
lndian like the country.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.235
He's Indian—American.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.821
You got an Indian—American congressman
in Louisiana?

40:51.950 --> 40:54.908
First Cubans, then the Mexicans, now lndians.

40:55.037 --> 40:57.870
Who says we're the party of white folk?

40:57.998 --> 41:01.661
Jindal reps the first congressional district.
And he's really young.

41:01.793 --> 41:05.706
But he jumped into the governor's race
three years ago and he showed pretty well.

41:05.839 --> 41:09.457
- He got a committee up?
— Not yet. Gonna announce in January.

41:09.593 --> 41:11.504
Well, you know I'm in.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.504
Better than that, I can make some calls
in Dallas, bring some real rain.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.301
Bless you, my son.

41:16.433 --> 41:19.300
Hey, you show me a ring and I'll kiss it.
No problem.

41:20.437 --> 41:24.021
— (Commentary continues)
— (Crowd cheering)

41:24.149 --> 41:25.980
(J‘ Bounce music playing)

41:30.530 --> 41:33.613
Hey. What are you
doing here this early?

41:33.742 --> 41:35.824
I switched shifts with David.

41:35.952 --> 41:37.817
He hates Thanksgiving as a concept.

41:37.954 --> 41:39.694
So do I, actually,

41:39.831 --> 41:42.538
but I need to post at my parents'
for, uh, turkey.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.377
No more bounce, Davis,
not this early.

41:47.506 --> 41:49.792
Go somewhere else with it.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.665
l'm fucking serious.

41:51.802 --> 41:53.292
(Laughs) OK.

42:11.238 --> 42:13.695
— What's your system?
- Oh, no system.

42:13.824 --> 42:16.907
| just try to wheel the favorite for an exacta.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.276
Well, at least you know
what you don't know.

42:19.413 --> 42:21.779
Some people have a certain misplaced faith.

42:21.915 --> 42:23.997
You see that fella down by the rail?

42:24.126 --> 42:26.492
Black fella, glasses,

42:26.628 --> 42:28.289
purple shirt, dark jacket.

42:28.422 --> 42:29.628
Oliver Thomas,

42:29.756 --> 42:31.621
president of the city council,

42:31.758 --> 42:34.044
probably the next mayor
if he wants it.

42:34.177 --> 42:35.462
Yeah?

42:35.595 --> 42:37.335
Oliver loves the ponies.

42:37.472 --> 42:39.463
He's a decent guy,

42:39.599 --> 42:42.682
certainly an improvement
over Nagin for sure.

42:42.811 --> 42:45.518
- A Democrat, I'm guessing?
— Well, somebody's got to be.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.433
Hey, this is a purple state.

42:47.566 --> 42:50.729
Orleans Parish is blue.
Makes sense to work both sides of the aisle.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.811
Go ahead, make a new friend.

42:58.577 --> 43:01.364
(J‘ Rap music playing)

43:09.796 --> 43:11.787
(Song muffled)

43:11.923 --> 43:13.333
(Speech inaudible)

43:15.135 --> 43:16.841
Turn around. Bounce your ass.

43:17.846 --> 43:19.177
(She laughs)

43:19.306 --> 43:21.297
Do it, come on.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.924
(Laughing) No, no.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.804
- (Turns off music)
— This is DJ Davis. I'm out.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.899
Gentilly Junior is right behind me.
Happy Thanksgiving, y'all.

43:33.028 --> 43:36.236
This next one is for
my station manager.

43:36.364 --> 43:39.527
(J‘ Dirty Dozen Brass Band:
Everything I Do Gonh Be Funky)

43:39.659 --> 43:42.150
- Later, Gent.
— OK, I'll see you later, baby.

45:41.990 --> 45:43.981
(Boys laughing)

46:23.448 --> 46:24.437
(Giggling)

46:26.076 --> 46:29.443
So, Brandy, you guys met when?

46:29.579 --> 46:32.070
Last Mardi Gras at a party.

46:32.207 --> 46:33.697
Oh, you're from down here?

46:33.833 --> 46:34.913
Born and raised.

46:35.043 --> 46:37.580
Oh, I guess I musta got confused.

46:38.421 --> 46:41.458
(Robinette) Ain't no oven,
but warming up on the grill.

46:41.591 --> 46:43.331
Ooh, I'm on it.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.927
So that's your down—here girlfriend?

46:48.056 --> 46:49.921
Be nice. Be quiet.

46:50.058 --> 46:51.923
I'm just trying to keep proper score.

46:52.060 --> 46:55.928
Speaking of which, whatever happened
to Daddy's thing - Lula, was it?

46:56.064 --> 46:59.181
— My guess, she had an opinion.
—(Laughs)

46:59.317 --> 47:02.525
I don't know if he put her down
or if it's part of something bigger.

47:02.654 --> 47:04.269
He seems tired.

47:04.406 --> 47:06.237
He seems more than tired.

47:06.366 --> 47:07.856
He call a practice yet?

47:07.993 --> 47:09.949
I don't think so.

47:11.246 --> 47:14.909
All right, call George, tell him to ask Big Chief
if we can call practice on Sunday.

47:15.041 --> 47:17.248
Then let slip l'm—a stay down here for it.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.914
Let my daddy hear I'm thinking about
masking lndian this year.

47:20.046 --> 47:22.332
— Boy, you're devious.
- (Laughing)

47:23.258 --> 47:25.249
Yeah.

47:25.385 --> 47:27.592
— Look at this haircut. The bowl cut.
— Look at the ears.

47:27.721 --> 47:30.713
(Mother) What's wrong with his ears?
(Annie) No, they're beautiful.

47:30.849 --> 47:32.965
(Mother) l'm teasing, darling.
(Annie) What's that?

47:33.101 --> 47:34.557
(Mother) Oh, that. That was a musical.

47:34.686 --> 47:37.519
- (Annie laughing)
— (Mother) Yeah, look at him.

47:37.647 --> 47:40.810
Davis, did I ever tell you

47:40.942 --> 47:42.523
how I could drive

47:42.652 --> 47:45.109
my 1958 Mercury Monterey

47:45.238 --> 47:49.106
from the LSU campus to the corner of
Dumaine and Dauphine

47:49.242 --> 47:53.281
in 42 minutes flat
on a Saturday night?

47:53.413 --> 47:55.825
— Oh, I surely could.
- (Laughter)

47:55.957 --> 47:58.369
I'll bet you were a hellion in college,

47:58.501 --> 48:01.368
as cruel as you were beautiful.

48:02.005 --> 48:05.042
Listen, the song had it right
about those LSU boys -

48:05.175 --> 48:07.382
go in dumb, come out dumb too.

48:09.137 --> 48:12.300
Now, an Auburn man...

48:12.432 --> 48:14.013
— (Mouths)
— (Mother) Stop it, Mimi.

48:14.142 --> 48:16.474
You're just saying that to make Roger angry.

48:16.603 --> 48:20.061
I believe my father has passed
the possibility of anger.

48:20.190 --> 48:22.476
(Mother) He had fun. Leave him alone.

48:22.609 --> 48:25.442
How did you get him to wear that?

48:25.570 --> 48:28.027
(Mother) You know, with a little bribery.

48:28.156 --> 48:30.272
Not to eat and flee, but, uh,

48:30.408 --> 48:32.990
— Annie and I want to catch this bounce show...
— (Annie) Oh, no.

48:33.119 --> 48:35.826
— ..on the West Bank, so we gotta go.
- No, Davis, this is so great.

48:35.955 --> 48:38.617
— Yeah, we're having fun.
— Can we stay a minute?

48:39.375 --> 48:41.957
Well, I could just take a cab, then.

48:42.337 --> 48:47.047
While I go to the club alone,
you're gonna stay here with my mother?

48:47.175 --> 48:48.506
This is the plan?

48:48.635 --> 48:50.546
Well, Davis,

48:50.678 --> 48:54.546
if you really require
an escort for this affair,

48:54.682 --> 48:56.968
I am more than game.

48:57.102 --> 48:58.763
Mimi, act your age.

48:58.895 --> 49:00.977
Well, why in God's name

49:01.106 --> 49:04.564
would I ever want to do
anything of that sort?

49:06.319 --> 49:08.310
You and me at a bounce show?

49:09.489 --> 49:10.399
J‘ Everybody, everybody

J‘ Bounce it for the seventh ward,

J‘ And if you bounce uptown

49:49.779 --> 49:52.521
— Not for long, I fear.
— What?

49:52.657 --> 49:54.989
Oh, hey, Aunt Mimi, Katey Red.

49:55.118 --> 49:57.530
- Hi.
— Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.698
You too. My God,

49:59.831 --> 50:02.288

He owns this shop uptown.

50:09.883 --> 50:12.670
And he has a pair of blue pumps on tonight
that put my shit to shame.

50:12.802 --> 50:14.417
You just lead on, girlfriend.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.419
— Come on, girl.
— Bye.

50:16.556 --> 50:17.841
Bye.

50:39.204 --> 50:41.195
(LaDonna) Slide over, baby.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.459
It was a good Thanksgiving, Ma.

50:59.474 --> 51:03.183
That's 25 thou each
per 7500 cubic yards cleared.

51:03.311 --> 51:06.144
But you gotta make that number
in three weeks. Questions?

51:06.272 --> 51:09.389
Yeah, why us four
and not some of the other haulers?

51:09.525 --> 51:11.311
I don't even know you, brah.

51:11.444 --> 51:14.777
Well, to tell you the truth,
I asked the sub they put me under

51:14.906 --> 51:17.192
for licensed guys that were already
getting FEMA money

51:17.325 --> 51:18.940
and had five or six trucks working.

51:19.077 --> 51:20.192
He gave me you.

51:20.328 --> 51:22.785
Now, if he's wrong,
I'll ask for other names.

51:22.914 --> 51:24.450
Is he wrong?

51:29.337 --> 51:32.454
Call when you've made the number, and by
then I might have another piece of the pie.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.581
Anyone has a problem,
I do not fucking care.

51:34.717 --> 51:36.628
Just get it done in three weeks
and we're good.

51:36.761 --> 51:39.002
Now make like the holiday
and be thankful.

51:42.100 --> 51:43.590
(Door lock chirps)

51:48.189 --> 51:50.771
If we're pulling 25 for the work,

51:50.900 --> 51:52.731
what do you think he's pulling?

51:53.820 --> 51:55.435
Motherfucker.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.232
Don't even think about it, brah.

— Man, ljust got robbed.

— Yeah, yeah, man.

53:30.124 --> 53:33.161
— J‘ Still up in New Orleans
- J‘ New Orleans

53:33.294 --> 53:35.000
J‘ Talkin' post—Katrina

53:35.588 --> 53:36.919
J‘ Hey

53:37.465 --> 53:38.500
J‘ Hey

53:39.926 --> 53:41.041
J‘ Hey

53:42.261 --> 53:43.467
J‘ Hey

53:47.517 --> 53:48.723
J‘HeyJ‘

53:51.187 --> 53:53.894
(J‘ Professor Longhair: Cry to Me)

53:54.023 --> 53:55.638
(Arguing, indistinct)

53:58.569 --> 54:00.855
lt's fucking New Orleans, man!
It's New Orleans.

54:00.988 --> 54:02.444
This station is New Orleans!

54:02.573 --> 54:04.438
Don't fucking tell me
what New Orleans...

54:04.575 --> 54:07.783
Don't talk about New Orleans.
This is New Orleans.

54:14.252 --> 54:17.289
(Music continues on radio, muffled)

54:23.428 --> 54:25.009
What's going on, y'all?

54:28.641 --> 54:30.051
He knew, right?

54:30.184 --> 54:32.766
| asked him if we could have practice,
he said yeah.

54:32.895 --> 54:35.682
Told him you was coming too, so he knows.

54:41.195 --> 54:43.481
(I Cry To Me continues)

55:07.555 --> 55:10.012
Man, I don't know why the hell
I blew off on you like that, man.

55:10.141 --> 55:12.052
You need to use him for your gigs,
you can use him.

55:12.185 --> 55:14.016
Nah, don't carry it like that, Bennie.

55:14.145 --> 55:16.477
If you can't spare him
then that's all she wrote.

55:16.606 --> 55:17.812
Man, to tell you the truth,

55:17.940 --> 55:20.602
I'm about sick and tired
of this whole brass band thing, man.

55:20.735 --> 55:23.067
— I think I've had enough.
- Bennie.

55:23.196 --> 55:25.232
Police killed Joe like they did,

55:25.364 --> 55:26.900
plus they lied on him.

55:27.033 --> 55:29.319
That's the third guy we lost.

55:29.452 --> 55:31.067
Then the storm hit.

55:31.204 --> 55:33.570
We all scattered all over this place.

55:33.706 --> 55:36.948
Then the accident in Atlanta
with Terrell losing both his legs, man.

55:37.084 --> 55:39.120
I'm just tired.

55:39.879 --> 55:41.585
Water.

55:44.091 --> 55:46.582
— You heard about Jamal?
— No, no. What happened?

55:46.719 --> 55:48.801
— He gotjacked.
— Oh, man.

55:48.930 --> 55:49.919
For real.

55:50.056 --> 55:52.138
Parked around the corner
and this boy puts a gun in his face

55:52.266 --> 55:54.257
before he gets halfway to the club.

55:54.393 --> 55:57.055
That's crazy. I saw him right after.

55:57.188 --> 55:59.053
Yeah, man, happened on Gravier.

55:59.190 --> 56:02.057
Hurricane ain't enough to wake these
knuckleheads up, I don't know what is.

56:02.193 --> 56:04.479
I mean, live your life, man. Have fun.

56:04.612 --> 56:08.150
But if you're from New Orleans,
then act like you're from New Orleans.

56:08.282 --> 56:10.944
Shit's bad, man, real bad.

56:12.411 --> 56:14.493
Your man on the snare, he's tight.

56:14.622 --> 56:17.329
Dinerral? Yeah, he rock.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.831
Look, y'all come too far to quit now, Bennie.

56:19.961 --> 56:22.668
I can find another trumpet
if it don't work, for real.

56:22.797 --> 56:25.584
Nah, nah, nah, man.
You can use him.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.833
It's all good, man.
Shit's never easy around here, though.

56:28.970 --> 56:30.551
You know that.

56:40.940 --> 56:42.521
Sofia.

56:49.156 --> 56:51.147
Are you asleep, sweetie?
