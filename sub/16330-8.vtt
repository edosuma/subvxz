00:04.156 --> 00:06.194
(Patterson) Nothing unusual so far.

00:06.264 --> 00:08.855
Everything looks normal.

00:08.917 --> 00:13.121
Reade, Zapata...
<i>Anything suspicious?</i>

00:13.156 --> 00:15.935
(Reade) Negative, just the
support staff coming and going.

00:17.198 --> 00:19.033
Something's not right.

00:19.068 --> 00:20.933
The message said to stand by.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.625
I think they want us to wait.

00:23.999 --> 00:26.501
All right. We wait.

00:32.662 --> 00:34.847
I went to the precinct and
broke into the crime lab.

00:34.882 --> 00:37.150
I stole the knife that killed Jones.

00:38.994 --> 00:40.179
I was trying to protect you.

00:40.230 --> 00:41.899
Tasha, I didn't kill him.
Why can't you believe me?

00:41.923 --> 00:43.394
Well, I believe you now.
The knife isn't yours.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.055
It's Freddy's.

00:45.133 --> 00:47.870
What? How do you know it's Freddy's?

00:47.905 --> 00:50.528
I saw him with it when he
was staying in your apartment.

00:51.229 --> 00:54.952
I have evidence for a murder case
underneath a beach towel in my closet,

00:55.007 --> 00:57.342
and I can't figure out how to put
it back without getting caught.

00:57.366 --> 00:58.684
Put it back? What are you talking about?

00:58.708 --> 01:00.856
That knife convicts Freddy,
you can't put it back now.

- (grunts weakly)
- The man and the woman you were with,

01:56.728 --> 01:57.794
where'd they go?

01:58.750 --> 02:00.902
Anyone got eyes on Jane and Weller?

02:00.937 --> 02:04.035
Nas... they're not here.

02:07.964 --> 02:10.776
Okay, uh, take them to interrogation.

02:11.704 --> 02:13.543
(Reade) Those two are our best
shot at finding Weller and Jane.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.621
- We gotta get them talking soon.
- How the hell did this happen?

02:15.645 --> 02:17.656
I'm awfully curious about that myself.

02:17.726 --> 02:19.306
Matthew Weitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.974
There is not a lawyer in the
land who can get you out of this.

02:23.045 --> 02:24.269
What are you doing here?

02:24.380 --> 02:26.587
Monitoring this investigation.

02:26.665 --> 02:30.050
U.S. Attorney has assigned
me to audit this team today,

02:30.128 --> 02:32.583
which is standard procedure
when the FBI gets involved

02:32.648 --> 02:34.177
in a matter of Homeland Security...

02:34.234 --> 02:37.126
in this case, a car bomb going off
outside a major political summit

02:37.176 --> 02:39.369
between the U.S. and China.

02:39.404 --> 02:41.612
Hi, you must be Nas Kamal.

02:41.667 --> 02:43.567
I came here expecting to actually talk

02:43.622 --> 02:46.447
Assistant Director Weller,
but instead I was sent to you.

02:46.487 --> 02:50.069
It seems as though Weller
and his asset Jane Doe

02:50.133 --> 02:52.585
simply vanished from a crime scene.

02:52.647 --> 02:55.524
It's funny how that keeps
happening to members of this team.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.240
You know what I find funny?

02:57.302 --> 03:00.581
You being assigned to audit us after you
tried to put our boss away for murder.

03:00.616 --> 03:01.794
Is that standard procedure too?

03:01.818 --> 03:04.659
(Nas) Reade, why don't you
start with the interrogations?

03:07.951 --> 03:10.731
Are you making an accusation of misconduct?

03:10.783 --> 03:13.287
Not yet, but this is a
team with a proud history

03:13.322 --> 03:14.797
of breaking the rules,
and now they're working

03:14.821 --> 03:18.168
a joint task force with an NSA agent.

03:18.203 --> 03:19.245
I'm sure I'll find something.

03:19.269 --> 03:20.709
I have two missing operatives, okay?

03:20.757 --> 03:22.815
This is... this is a waste of my time.

03:22.862 --> 03:24.757
Pardon me if I can't take your word for it.

03:24.793 --> 03:26.897
Now, you are gonna tell
me everything you know

03:26.932 --> 03:29.913
about whatever ill-conceived op
you were running at that summit.

03:29.948 --> 03:33.374
So, let's start at the beginning, shall we?

03:34.711 --> 03:37.899
Agent Patterson had a case this morning.

03:37.974 --> 03:41.444
So, remember Jane's Ashwell
Creek Kennels tattoos?

03:41.493 --> 03:42.644
(Reade) How could we forget?

03:42.701 --> 03:45.634
They pointed us to that online puppy
forum that led us to Rich Dotcom.

03:45.681 --> 03:48.271
(Patterson) After that case, I
thought it would be a good idea

03:48.326 --> 03:51.251
to put up some coded posts
listing criminals for hire,

03:51.316 --> 03:54.906
see if we could catch anyone else, all
under the disguise of dog adoptions.

03:54.941 --> 03:56.826
- Smart.
- So, I put up profiles

03:56.884 --> 03:59.451
for all of us, and no
one was biting until now.

03:59.486 --> 04:01.284
Congratulations, Jane and Weller.

04:01.327 --> 04:02.849
You've both been hired for a heist crew.

04:02.873 --> 04:04.418
Well, do we know who hired us?

04:04.453 --> 04:05.539
Unfortunately, no.

04:05.574 --> 04:07.752
The account was untraceable,
like, crazy untraceable.

04:07.787 --> 04:09.104
But here's the good news.

04:09.151 --> 04:12.006
There were two other people who
were hired for the same crew.

04:12.070 --> 04:16.507
Lynn Burton, young hacker who surfaced
on the dark web a couple years ago,

04:16.584 --> 04:19.038
believed to have stolen over $100 million,

04:19.072 --> 04:20.545
all through bank cyber heists.

04:20.598 --> 04:22.453
And Clive Doyle,

04:22.488 --> 04:25.946
your standard violent career
criminal, rap sheet's a mile long.

04:26.012 --> 04:27.717
Half of it is homicide charges.

04:27.787 --> 04:30.580
This is great work, but we
should send another team.

04:30.615 --> 04:33.694
That's not an option. I used real
descriptions, real skill sets.

04:33.759 --> 04:36.744
The profiles are specific to Jane
and Weller. It has to be them.

04:36.779 --> 04:38.690
This is a straightforward sting op.

04:38.762 --> 04:40.229
Yeah, but it's still risky.

04:40.292 --> 04:41.758
We'd be putting you and Jane undercover

04:41.782 --> 04:45.251
for an op that's not really
relevant to our larger mission.

04:46.564 --> 04:48.571
What... larger mission?

04:48.606 --> 04:50.352
No... that's above your clearance.

04:50.405 --> 04:52.284
Uh, no. See this...

04:52.365 --> 04:55.550
this warrant states that there
is nothing above my clearance.

04:55.585 --> 04:57.799
That warrant covers
information that is relevant

04:57.861 --> 04:59.871
to today's events, and I'm telling you

04:59.953 --> 05:01.839
that it is not relevant.

05:03.514 --> 05:05.572
You know, if you didn't approve of the op,

05:05.607 --> 05:06.953
then why did you agree to it?

05:06.988 --> 05:09.357
Who's calling the shots here?
Is it you or is it Weller?

05:09.427 --> 05:12.335
Look, Assistant Director
Weller and I trust each other.

05:12.414 --> 05:14.078
He made a very good case as to why

05:14.141 --> 05:17.220
we should do the mission,
and that's why we did it.

05:17.255 --> 05:19.285
(Jane) Do we have to cover
my tattoos for this one?

05:19.335 --> 05:20.409
I'm supposed to be a criminal.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.037
Well, you're supposed to be a con artist,

05:22.061 --> 05:25.247
which means being able to blend
in, and those do not blend.

05:25.309 --> 05:26.697
(Nas) And you'll be wearing this.

05:26.765 --> 05:29.168
There's a burst transmitter
woven into the fibers

05:29.238 --> 05:30.984
that's completely undetectable.

05:31.054 --> 05:33.747
It won't emit a signal to us
until you press the top button.

05:33.782 --> 05:35.775
I'll hit that as soon as
Clive and Lynn get there.

05:35.810 --> 05:38.276
We'll be outside to make the arrest.
Should be a clean job, in and out.

05:38.300 --> 05:42.052
Well, that is great, because you
all need to prepare your taste buds

05:42.106 --> 05:43.840
for this pink or blue party cake.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.534
Now, I did a third test batch last night.

05:46.569 --> 05:47.933
One word... scrummy.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.483
I know Baby Weller is the star here,

05:49.546 --> 05:52.079
but this cake is gonna give
the kid a run for its money.

05:52.135 --> 05:53.135
Patterson.

05:53.841 --> 05:55.978
It's a small party.

05:56.025 --> 05:57.220
- No, I get it.
- Yeah.

05:57.278 --> 05:58.555
Allie wanted to throw it.

05:58.618 --> 06:00.047
Please, really, it's fine.

06:00.082 --> 06:03.186
The cake is terrible,
it's just uneven bake,

06:03.267 --> 06:04.854
s-soggy bottom.

06:04.889 --> 06:06.145
Good save.

06:06.236 --> 06:07.748
(Nas) We put a mobile TAC team together

06:07.772 --> 06:10.009
and dropped Jane and
Weller off at the meet.

06:15.539 --> 06:16.706
See you in there.

06:18.672 --> 06:20.603
(Nas) And that's the last time I saw them,

06:20.638 --> 06:23.235
at an abandoned warehouse in Green Point.

06:23.270 --> 06:24.725
So, just to be clear,

06:24.803 --> 06:27.899
you sent two highly-trained operatives
into a mission that, by your own account,

06:27.923 --> 06:29.839
should have taken a matter
of minutes, and instead,

06:29.863 --> 06:31.943
they turned what was a
peaceful, diplomatic gathering

06:31.994 --> 06:36.088
into a war zone, and then
disappeared without a trace.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.692
- How did that happen?
- I don't know, okay?

06:39.795 --> 06:42.079
But Jane and Weller do,
so if you want answers,

06:42.150 --> 06:45.913
then... why don't you
help me get my people back?

06:47.343 --> 06:48.912
How do you propose that we do that?

06:48.970 --> 06:52.265
Through our original targets,
Lynn Burton and Clive Doyle.

06:52.338 --> 06:53.431
They're sitting in interrogation.

06:53.455 --> 06:56.123
Look, my guess is, is
that they have information

06:56.158 --> 06:57.224
that could help us track them down,

06:57.248 --> 07:00.217
because right now...
they could be anywhere.

07:03.675 --> 07:04.608
Uhh!

07:04.655 --> 07:06.268
Resist all you want.

ooh, they don't do so well in there.

Then you gotta tell me what you do know.

I was hired on the message boards.

08:41.179 --> 08:43.736
It said to meet at this warehouse.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.515
I was the last one there.

08:45.610 --> 08:48.162
It was me, Clive, the cops.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.112
- Mm-hmm, Jane, Weller.
- Yeah.

08:50.192 --> 08:52.947

08:55.730 --> 08:57.519
from the Evergreen Environmental Summit.

08:57.554 --> 08:58.491
What's the target?

08:58.546 --> 09:02.456
That's not important, the point
is, security is extremely high.

09:02.519 --> 09:04.571
Both Secret Service and
their Chinese counterpart,

09:04.606 --> 09:05.989

09:06.029 --> 09:07.547
It's a risky job.

But my employer has had his eye

09:12.411 --> 09:13.971
If you succeed in delivering it to him,

09:14.029 --> 09:16.281
you'll each be wired $2 million.

09:16.316 --> 09:19.513
Pfft, eight-mil on one job.

(Patterson) Nico Marconi, number
eight on the FBI's Most Wanted List.

09:29.854 --> 09:32.439
One of the most notorious

09:32.547 --> 09:34.099
No one's ever been able
to put a face to him,

09:34.123 --> 09:35.646
let alone get in the same room with him.

09:35.670 --> 09:37.421
That's why Weller didn't send the signal.

09:37.499 --> 09:39.760
He must have decided to stay
undercover to get to Marconi.

09:39.784 --> 09:41.554
So, they could be with Marconi now.

09:41.589 --> 09:43.622
I'll dig a little deeper

09:43.657 --> 09:46.571
look for any known locations

09:46.629 --> 09:49.763

- No, let me have him.

09:56.188 --> 09:57.865
We know that you were working for him.

09:57.914 --> 09:59.716
Is that why you're not talking?

09:59.755 --> 10:00.700
You're scared of him.

10:02.571 --> 10:05.095
I'm not scared of anyone, lady.

10:05.183 --> 10:07.447
You see this? I got this at Rikers.

10:07.515 --> 10:09.515
It's Sanskrit for "brass balls."

10:09.561 --> 10:12.368
Well, that's funny, though, because, uh...

10:12.403 --> 10:15.192
Lynn was saying that
you froze up back there.

10:15.313 --> 10:17.942
That sounds like a classic
case of "he said, she said."

10:17.977 --> 10:19.730
Except she's the only one who's talking,

10:19.801 --> 10:22.312
so unless you tell your side of the story,

10:22.367 --> 10:23.764
that's all we've got to go on.

10:23.861 --> 10:25.501
But that's fine, I'm sure your prison rep

10:25.545 --> 10:27.385
can survive a five-foot
hacker saving your ass.

10:27.436 --> 10:29.967
Hey, don't believe a damn word that
comes out of that IT nerd's mouth.

10:29.991 --> 10:31.992
Then give me something to believe.

10:35.565 --> 10:39.397
Five years... and I want conjugals.

10:39.487 --> 10:41.623
No, no, you know what?

10:41.694 --> 10:43.840
I wanna go to Otisville.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.925
My buddy Kevin's doing life there.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.758
I'll see what I can do.

10:48.644 --> 10:49.685
Start talking.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.862
Emile had everything planned out.

10:51.897 --> 10:54.394
He arranged for us to go
undercover as a bunch of caterers.

10:54.468 --> 10:57.118
(Emile) If we run into
any trouble at the summit,

10:57.167 --> 10:59.602
we'll communicate through these.

11:01.717 --> 11:03.431
Emergencies only!

11:29.675 --> 11:32.341
(Clive) I was in charge of
smuggling in all the weapons.

11:32.431 --> 11:33.531
(clicking)

11:38.741 --> 11:42.246
Slapped the hardware together,
and we were ready to go.

11:42.281 --> 11:44.649
No, it wasn't just him.

11:45.016 --> 11:47.033
Jane and Weller were helping.

11:47.114 --> 11:49.044
After they put the guns together,

11:49.108 --> 11:53.791
we changed again to look like
we were attending the summit.

11:53.861 --> 11:56.949
There was something going
on between Jane and Weller.

11:57.022 --> 11:58.636
I think they were having problems.

11:58.671 --> 12:00.636
You damn right they were having problems.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.078
She was vibing with me and he was jealous.

12:03.159 --> 12:04.827
This is my favorite.

12:04.881 --> 12:06.617
Let me show you how to use that.

12:07.087 --> 12:08.882
- Okay.
- Don't hurt yourself.

12:08.971 --> 12:11.441
(Clive) Oh, yeah, Lynn
gave something to Emile.

12:11.515 --> 12:13.709
Some sort of equipment
with "Timberland" on it.

12:13.764 --> 12:15.595
(Zapata) Timberland Defense Systems.

12:15.715 --> 12:18.162
Manufactures radar jammers
for the U.S. military

12:18.197 --> 12:21.463
to hide their boats and
planes from enemy radar.

12:21.564 --> 12:23.405
It sounds like that's what Lynn gave Emile.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.915
And she didn't want us to know.

12:24.975 --> 12:27.704
(Weitz) What did he want with a
radar jammer in a conference center?

12:27.750 --> 12:28.996
(Reade) If the jammer wasn't for the heist,

12:29.020 --> 12:30.942
then it had to have been for the escape.

12:30.992 --> 12:33.401
Maybe Emile had to get the item
out of New York after they stole it.

12:33.425 --> 12:36.226
And the only use for a jammer like
that is to cloak a boat or a plane.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.718
So if Jane and Weller are still with
them, then that's what we're looking for.

12:39.753 --> 12:43.728
We should search the Coast Guard
and FAA for radar disturbances.

12:43.795 --> 12:45.523
Okay, do it.

12:47.835 --> 12:51.150
So, you armed up, you blended in to
look like the delegates... then what?

12:51.206 --> 12:52.593
We split up.

12:52.651 --> 12:54.351
Lynn and Emile were supposed
to cause a distraction

12:54.375 --> 12:55.998
while the rest of us secured the item.

12:56.033 --> 12:57.382
♪♪

12:57.417 --> 12:59.443
Emile had done all the recon ahead of time,

12:59.478 --> 13:02.327
so he explained each layer of
security we had to get through.

13:02.394 --> 13:03.861
We'll take it from here.

13:03.921 --> 13:06.489
(Clive) Hell, we had access
to everything but the vault.

13:09.117 --> 13:10.717
(grunting)

13:15.856 --> 13:17.613
Clive! Help us!

13:17.671 --> 13:19.105
(neck cracks)

13:21.790 --> 13:23.224
(grunting)

13:24.316 --> 13:26.250
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

13:39.005 --> 13:40.561
(snickers softly)

13:40.652 --> 13:45.860
You're telling me that
you rescued two FBI agents?

13:46.751 --> 13:48.538
Yes. Yes, I am.

13:49.972 --> 13:51.506
Did you get the item or not?

13:53.783 --> 13:54.917
(Weller gasps)

14:00.038 --> 14:01.605
(latches snap)

14:03.411 --> 14:05.718
Well, that was very anticlimactic.

14:05.796 --> 14:08.379
(Jane) That looks like the design
for the green energy device.

14:08.517 --> 14:09.686
Corporate espionage.

14:09.721 --> 14:11.829
Definitely not in the Nico Marconi's style.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.089
- (alarm trilling)
- Damn it!

14:14.218 --> 14:15.516
It's weight-censored.

14:15.551 --> 14:17.791
But Emile knew the security
to this place inside and out.

14:17.822 --> 14:20.526
How could he not tell us
there was a weight censor?

14:20.580 --> 14:22.056
'Cause he wanted us to get caught.

14:22.119 --> 14:25.663
That alarm just sent every
guard on this floor to this room.

14:25.731 --> 14:27.273
We're not the ones stealing the item.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.811
We're the distraction.

14:35.064 --> 14:37.647
- Just throw the knife out.
- I can't!

14:39.322 --> 14:42.146
Someone saw me at the precinct.

14:42.224 --> 14:44.307
An old coworker.

14:44.377 --> 14:47.490
At any moment, the lab is going to
realize that the knife is missing,

14:47.548 --> 14:49.928
and when that happens, I will be screwed.

14:49.963 --> 14:52.185
You should have thought about that
before you decided to steal evidence.

14:52.209 --> 14:56.546
I did! You think I didn't realize
that I could go to prison for this?

14:59.324 --> 15:02.118
But you are my best friend.

15:02.846 --> 15:04.892
That was the risk that I was
willing to take to save you,

15:04.916 --> 15:07.108
but I will not go to prison to save Freddy,

15:07.186 --> 15:10.216
and that is exactly what will happen
if we don't put that knife back.

15:10.251 --> 15:13.003
You don't understand.
I made Freddy testify.

15:13.074 --> 15:14.527
I brought this back into his life.

15:14.589 --> 15:17.700
If I hadn't done that, maybe none
of this would have ever happened.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.975
How am I gonna turn him in?

15:32.824 --> 15:34.663
So, Emile lied about the briefcase?

15:34.733 --> 15:37.232
- It was just a distraction?
- Yes.

15:37.283 --> 15:40.021
They weren't stealing
the real item, we were.

15:40.083 --> 15:45.217
The real target was being
monitored 24/7 by two CSB guards.

15:45.272 --> 15:47.936
But Emile knew their emergency protocols.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.984
When the alarm sounded,
the guards would head

15:50.029 --> 15:52.275
to their helicopter on the roof.

15:52.364 --> 15:56.078
He had me rewire the elevator
so that when you select "roof,"

15:56.146 --> 15:58.758
it went to the basement instead.

15:58.842 --> 16:00.092
(elevator bell dings)

16:01.353 --> 16:02.805
(alarm blaring)

16:02.840 --> 16:04.173
(gunshots)

16:05.623 --> 16:08.192
I never saw what was in the bag.

16:08.286 --> 16:10.962
- Come on.
- We just ran to the van.

16:11.155 --> 16:13.698
- We've got two minutes.
- Okay.

16:13.765 --> 16:14.799
(gunshots)

16:17.321 --> 16:20.292
- (distant crowd screaming)
- Damn it... the van's blown.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.761
We gotta find a new way out.

16:21.851 --> 16:23.576
But all my equipment's in
there, I need to get it.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.934
There's no time.

16:27.095 --> 16:28.129
Aah!

16:34.419 --> 16:37.781
Lynn said that you never made
it back to the rendezvous point.

16:37.860 --> 16:39.665
What happened?

16:39.739 --> 16:42.542
(alarm trilling)

16:42.628 --> 16:44.925
They've got us trapped.

16:45.033 --> 16:46.540
- (gun cocks)
- Hey, uh-uh.

16:46.587 --> 16:47.937
No, no, no. It's a steel box.

16:47.972 --> 16:49.734
The bullets will ricochet like crazy.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.534
It's gonna have to be
hand-to-hand combat.

16:51.596 --> 16:53.008
(Weller) What? No.

16:53.075 --> 16:54.906
Hand-to-hand
combat, I-I-I...

16:54.970 --> 16:57.147
I can't make a fist after that fight.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.228
Don't worry.

16:59.314 --> 17:00.623
I got it.

17:00.677 --> 17:01.911
(beeping)

17:03.153 --> 17:03.828
Aaaargh!

17:03.898 --> 17:07.335
Let's just skip the part where you
singlehandedly fought off 20 armed guards.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.752
What happened next?

17:08.829 --> 17:12.145
I got us out of the vault,
but those Secret Service guys,

17:12.214 --> 17:13.721
they... they caught up to us.

17:13.784 --> 17:15.435
Those are some trigger-happy
sons o' bitches.

17:15.460 --> 17:17.582
(gunfire)

17:17.653 --> 17:20.823
(Emile) <i>Change of plans, new
getaway vehicle is a black Cadillac.</i>

17:20.891 --> 17:24.037
<i>Get to the east entrance in
60 seconds or get left behind.</i>

17:24.071 --> 17:26.338
- All right, okay, come on.
- We don't have enough time.

17:26.385 --> 17:27.952
You go, I'll hold 'em off.

17:28.010 --> 17:28.581
- Clive, no.
- Okay.

17:28.639 --> 17:30.297
Hey... go.

17:30.363 --> 17:31.266
♪♪

17:31.305 --> 17:33.032
I'll never forget you.

17:39.534 --> 17:42.780
I took out as many guys as
I could before I got KO'd.

17:43.364 --> 17:45.894
Then I woke up to you poking
me like a damn porcupine.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.370
Right, so the last time
you saw Jane and Weller,

17:48.405 --> 17:50.664
they headed for a black Cadillac.

17:50.742 --> 17:52.157
As far as I know.

17:54.936 --> 17:56.324
Oh, by the way, that tattoo?

17:56.382 --> 17:58.878
Uh, it's not Sanskrit, it's Arabic.

17:58.933 --> 18:00.396
What?

18:00.464 --> 18:01.897
What does it mean?

18:02.261 --> 18:06.322
Ah-ah, don't do that,
what does it mean? Yo!

18:06.388 --> 18:08.872
A black Cadillac left the east entrance
shortly after the bomb went off.

18:08.896 --> 18:10.697
No plates, but we tracked
it for about a mile.

18:10.758 --> 18:12.165
It got on the 87 going north.

18:12.227 --> 18:15.790
Of all the locations in the northeast
with ties to Nico Marconi, only 15

18:15.852 --> 18:17.273
are near water or an airfield,

18:17.344 --> 18:20.004
and only one of them is off 87 North.

18:20.108 --> 18:21.783
A plot of land on the waterfront.

18:21.854 --> 18:23.646
Marconi's shell company owns it.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.175
It's a defunct state park that closed down

18:25.199 --> 18:27.176
due to contamination,
so no one goes near it.

18:27.211 --> 18:29.227
A pretty good spot for
covert weapons deals.

18:29.262 --> 18:30.923
Okay, let's move.

18:35.652 --> 18:36.669
(Weitz) We've been driving for an hour.

18:36.693 --> 18:38.448
Are you sure this is
the best use of our time?

18:38.472 --> 18:39.317
(Reade) There's a lot of ground to cover.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.420
- (Zapata) Wait, up ahead.
- Jane!

18:42.190 --> 18:45.202
(panting)

18:45.296 --> 18:46.930
- Are you okay?
- Just winded.

18:47.038 --> 18:47.887
(Nas) Where's Weller?

18:47.922 --> 18:49.712
He went on the boat with Chen.

18:49.911 --> 18:50.913
Who's Chen?

18:51.409 --> 18:53.659
She's what we stole from the summit.

18:56.384 --> 18:59.650
(Patterson) Dr. Mingxia Chen,
she's a leader in plate tectonics

18:59.736 --> 19:01.131
who was giving a talk at the summit.

19:01.155 --> 19:05.413
She invented a method of converting
tectonic shifts into green energy.

19:05.448 --> 19:09.089
What does a weapons dealer like Marconi
want with an earthquake scientist?

19:09.124 --> 19:11.555
I think I might know. Over the past year,

19:11.633 --> 19:15.368
China has been conducting a massive study
on tsunami activity off their coastline.

19:15.403 --> 19:18.197
But there's been chatter that it's a cover,

19:18.232 --> 19:21.554
and that what they're really
doing is developing a tsunami bomb.

19:21.589 --> 19:22.443
- A what?
- It's a bomb

19:22.480 --> 19:25.383
that's detonated on the ocean
floor to mimic a tsunami.

19:25.446 --> 19:27.175
Concept was created during World War II,

19:27.229 --> 19:29.563
and they thought it could be
just as deadly as an atomic bomb.

19:29.587 --> 19:32.258
But they've never actually
made one work... have they?

19:32.312 --> 19:35.201
Well, last month, a small island
near China's research station

19:35.258 --> 19:37.377
was completely wiped
out overnight, literally.

19:37.451 --> 19:39.356
On the map one day, gone the next.

19:39.450 --> 19:42.569
It's believed that that was
their first successful test.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.971
And Mingxia Chen is...

19:44.041 --> 19:45.681
Head of R&D for the project.

19:45.759 --> 19:47.479
Instead of stealing a tsunami bomb,

19:47.559 --> 19:51.574
Nico Marconi kidnapped the only
person in the world who can make one.

19:51.765 --> 19:55.343
So, the question now is...
who's he gonna sell her to?

20:01.765 --> 20:03.616
Clive and Lynn both said
they were stealing an item,

20:03.640 --> 20:05.639
not a person, which means
either Emile kidnapped Chen

20:05.663 --> 20:07.464
from the summit all by himself,

20:07.530 --> 20:09.374
or one of them knows something
they're not letting on.

20:09.398 --> 20:10.761
And if they knew that Chen was the target,

20:10.785 --> 20:12.512
they might know where Emile is taking her.

20:12.547 --> 20:14.559
We need to compare their stories to Jane's,

20:14.613 --> 20:16.380
see what doesn't add up.

20:16.972 --> 20:20.227
When we got to the summit, Weller
filled me in on Nico Marconi.

20:20.277 --> 20:23.344
We both agreed we should stay
undercover to try to get to him.

20:23.615 --> 20:26.684
We disabled the guns without Clive seeing.

20:28.023 --> 20:30.468
We knew we had to get a line
out to you with our location.

20:30.506 --> 20:33.511
Hey, how'd you put that
Ruger together so fast?

20:34.930 --> 20:38.843
(Jane) He couldn't risk speaking,
so he dialed 1-0-1-2 instead.

20:39.373 --> 20:41.952
Police code for "do not
engage." We got the message.

20:42.038 --> 20:44.487
We know Clive lied about
the casualties in his story.

20:44.522 --> 20:47.025
None of the bodies were found at the scene.

20:47.112 --> 20:48.680
How'd you stop him?

20:50.668 --> 20:52.266
(Weller, whispering) No. No, Clive.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.714
No guns.

20:56.374 --> 20:57.908
(clears throat)

21:01.279 --> 21:02.184
Sir, I was just...

21:02.249 --> 21:04.350
(grunting)

21:07.781 --> 21:10.573
We made it out of the vault
before security arrived,

21:10.643 --> 21:12.564
but the Secret Service
was on our tail quick.

21:12.599 --> 21:14.600
(gunshots)

21:16.877 --> 21:19.645
(gun clicks, Clive grunts)

21:22.653 --> 21:25.922
So, Clive was with you the
whole time like he said?

21:26.076 --> 21:29.213
Which means that Lynn
must have known about Chen.

21:29.424 --> 21:31.412
Well, that would make sense.

21:31.693 --> 21:33.660
I'm pretty sure they knew each other.

21:34.485 --> 21:37.836
(Jane) They were the first two
there when we got to the warehouse,

21:37.871 --> 21:41.829
and she pretended that she didn't
know him, but later, I overheard her.

21:41.871 --> 21:43.082
We cut it close.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.622
The conference badges almost didn't clone.

21:45.752 --> 21:48.146
You told me they'd be
the same as last time.

21:49.251 --> 21:51.385
You weren't just another
hired hand, were you?

21:51.482 --> 21:54.222
Emile and you are associates, and
you planned the heist with him.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.466
I... Just part of it.

21:56.538 --> 21:58.556
What part, the part where
you kidnapped a woman?

21:59.395 --> 22:00.836
It wasn't a duffel bag
that you took, was it?

22:00.860 --> 22:02.928
It was Professor Chen, right?

22:03.112 --> 22:05.385
(smacks table) Right?!

22:05.420 --> 22:07.749
I swear to God, if you don't start talking,

22:07.845 --> 22:10.917
I'm gonna make sure that
you never see sunlight again.

22:12.890 --> 22:14.440
Yes.

22:15.019 --> 22:16.536
It was Chen.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.241
(elevator bell dings)

22:20.289 --> 22:21.757
(silencer gunshots)

22:21.807 --> 22:23.281
So why didn't you tell us about Chen?

22:23.305 --> 22:27.994
Because I was trying to protect
myself from kidnapping charges!

22:28.988 --> 22:32.436
So, when you guys got to the Cadillac,
that was the first time you saw Chen?

22:32.510 --> 22:34.745
No, we didn't see her till the boat.

22:39.748 --> 22:41.949
(Chen whimpering)

22:46.277 --> 22:47.680
_

22:47.732 --> 22:49.773
- Who the hell is that?
- This is the item.

22:50.003 --> 22:51.141
(speaking foreign language) _

22:51.165 --> 22:52.271
_

22:52.333 --> 22:55.232
- Chen. Chen Mingxia.
- Don't talk to her.

Weapons.

22:56.584 --> 22:57.639
(Chen) Please, help me.

22:57.705 --> 23:00.099
Good work. Marconi will be pleased.

23:02.575 --> 23:04.409
Take it in the woods and burn it.

23:05.284 --> 23:07.135
You can find your own way back.

23:11.502 --> 23:14.256
All right, what do we do?
We can't just leave Chen.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.298
Wherever she's going,

23:17.410 --> 23:19.577
that's where Nico Marconi is.

23:19.980 --> 23:22.185
There's too many of 'em
to take down without guns.

23:22.256 --> 23:25.287
We're at least 20 miles from civilization.

23:25.365 --> 23:27.071
You start running out of here, all right?

23:27.118 --> 23:28.795
Try and find a way to contact the team.

23:28.865 --> 23:30.570
I'm gonna get on that
yacht so we don't lose 'em.

23:30.594 --> 23:32.488
- No, I'll get on the yacht.
- No, Jane.

23:32.551 --> 23:34.820
We both know how dangerous this is.

23:35.257 --> 23:38.201
You have a baby on the way.
You have Sarah, you have Sawyer,

23:38.236 --> 23:40.537
people who would miss you
if anything happened to you.

23:40.721 --> 23:42.323
Look, I'm just being practical.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.176
But no one would miss me.
So, I'll get on the yacht.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.517
Do you hear that?

23:50.599 --> 23:51.553
There's a guard.

23:51.607 --> 23:53.222
He's on the other side of this building.

23:53.329 --> 23:54.563
He must be staying behind.

23:54.660 --> 23:55.794
All right, let's box him in,

23:55.852 --> 23:57.726
see if we can take his weapon, his phone.

23:57.761 --> 23:59.622
All right? Go right.

24:26.775 --> 24:29.258
Wait, Emile paid you in cash?

24:29.352 --> 24:32.047
Yeah, I buried our cut in the woods.

24:32.109 --> 24:33.748
Lynn said the money would be wired.

24:33.804 --> 24:36.210
- Maybe she just misspoke.
- Maybe, or maybe she slipped up

24:36.269 --> 24:38.170
and actually told the truth.

24:39.969 --> 24:40.660
Whoa, what are you doing?

24:40.695 --> 24:43.766
She's still lying to you,
but it's not for Emile.

24:43.831 --> 24:45.240
That equipment that you were trying to get

24:45.264 --> 24:48.336
out of the catering van, there
was a hard drive in there.

24:48.414 --> 24:51.207
The blast damaged the
fireproof housing pretty badly,

24:51.285 --> 24:53.020
but the inside was intact.

24:53.106 --> 24:54.775
And I just cracked it.

24:54.870 --> 24:57.325
Yeah, very, very not good for you.

24:57.419 --> 25:00.074
She builds the money transfer
sites for Marconi's sales,

25:00.109 --> 25:02.181
and they're pretty good,
actually, super secure,

25:02.216 --> 25:05.085
unhackable, but the real beauty is...

25:05.700 --> 25:09.248
that her cut is automatically wired
to her on completion of the sale.

25:09.334 --> 25:14.322
You want this Chen sale to go through
because you're still getting paid.

25:14.396 --> 25:16.264
Except I just found your
offshore bank account

25:16.342 --> 25:19.074
that you're transfer empties into...

25:19.266 --> 25:20.789
and it's just been seized by the FBI,

25:20.867 --> 25:23.252
so you're not gonna make
a cent off this sale.

25:23.342 --> 25:25.980
And if it does go through,
you'll be implicated

25:26.015 --> 25:29.109
in human trafficking, so
I suggest you hand over

25:29.144 --> 25:31.646
the site you built and let us shut it down.

25:33.195 --> 25:35.391
It's not a sale this time.

25:36.828 --> 25:40.151
Marconi thought Chen was one of a kind.

25:40.563 --> 25:43.144
Wanted to see how much he could get.

25:44.612 --> 25:46.847
It's a dark web auction.

25:48.556 --> 25:50.262
Tell us how to access it.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.319
(background chatter)

25:57.825 --> 26:00.226
Okay, so I've been doing some thinking...

26:00.333 --> 26:02.449
and you're right, we
gotta return the knife.

26:02.503 --> 26:03.503
Good. (sighs)

26:03.552 --> 26:05.330
That's...

26:05.373 --> 26:07.172
We just have to figure out how.

26:08.389 --> 26:09.756
I think I found a way.

26:09.822 --> 26:11.122
You can't bring it into the lab yourself

26:11.146 --> 26:12.566
because you were already
seen, but what if we make

26:12.590 --> 26:14.211
somebody do it for you?

26:14.246 --> 26:15.670
Why would somebody do that?

26:15.705 --> 26:17.180
Same reason why Lynn's lying:

26:17.234 --> 26:18.573
self-preservation.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.617
So... so, last year,

26:21.652 --> 26:24.178
a lab tech got suspended
for misplacing evidence.

26:24.258 --> 26:25.444
It cost them a case.

26:25.530 --> 26:27.200
He's still on probation.

26:27.265 --> 26:29.755
Now, what if he were to
find the knife in his car?

26:30.321 --> 26:32.275
He wouldn't report it
and risk getting fired.

26:32.330 --> 26:34.130
He'd just put it back.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.235
Yeah, but what if he
panics and throws it away?

26:36.270 --> 26:37.963
Not very smart... if
anything comes up missing,

26:37.987 --> 26:40.185
he's gonna be the first person they blame.

26:42.154 --> 26:43.753
You got a better idea?

26:43.993 --> 26:46.293
(Patterson) Reade, Zapata, get in here now!

26:50.663 --> 26:52.124

Weller and Chen will be long by then.

Can't Lynn just shut it down?

That's not the way that it works.

Marconi will have to provide a location
for us to collect the merchandise.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.852
Uh, in case you've all forgotten,

27:45.923 --> 27:48.673
the United States does not

in five minutes to make a more
specific ID on Marconi's boat.

28:02.496 --> 28:04.186

as soon as they get there,
and they do not have it,

30:05.119 --> 30:07.888

30:07.970 --> 30:09.563
They defied my direct orders,

30:09.640 --> 30:11.064
and you expect me to go bail 'em out?

30:11.088 --> 30:12.329

33:19.687 --> 33:21.044
Chen said he ran off that way.

33:21.164 --> 33:23.533
- He's going after Marconi.
- (coughs)

33:23.597 --> 33:24.898
All right, let's go.

33:34.077 --> 33:35.544
(branch snapping)

33:37.289 --> 33:39.202
Looks like you could use some backup.

33:39.938 --> 33:41.194
Nice to see you both.

33:41.229 --> 33:42.099
Are you okay?

33:42.133 --> 33:43.929
Yeah. You?

33:43.964 --> 33:45.796
- Yeah.
- And you?

33:46.595 --> 33:47.928
Let's get the hell outta here.

33:47.991 --> 33:49.838
Go around. Nas.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.158
FBI! Freeze.

33:57.264 --> 33:58.501
- Hands up!
- Drop your weapons!

33:58.525 --> 33:59.792
Drop 'em!

33:59.937 --> 34:02.831
Down on the ground, keep your
hands where I can see 'em.

34:02.866 --> 34:03.920
Move.

34:04.711 --> 34:07.364
Down on the ground. On the ground!

34:08.172 --> 34:09.474
Turn around.

34:15.681 --> 34:16.847
(click)

34:18.703 --> 34:22.072
Nico Marconi... you're under arrest.

34:24.876 --> 34:28.328
You went behind my back
and stole 20 million dollars

34:28.389 --> 34:30.560
from the U.S. government...
that is a federal crime!

34:30.594 --> 34:32.234
But we have Marconi in custody!

34:32.293 --> 34:33.933
I mean, we'll get all of that money back.

34:33.963 --> 34:35.471
What if you lost him?

34:35.505 --> 34:38.429
This was not a calculated,
tactical decision.

34:38.464 --> 34:39.931
This was a coin flip.

34:40.009 --> 34:42.768
And you don't get to keep your
job just because it came up heads.

34:42.821 --> 34:44.083
You don't have the power to fire me.

34:44.108 --> 34:45.972
Oh, then I will walk it up the chain

34:46.043 --> 34:48.094
till I find somebody who does.

34:48.129 --> 34:52.585
You will never work for the United
States government ever again.

34:52.719 --> 34:54.214
That's a promise.

34:54.248 --> 34:56.014
(chuckles) You know, Matthew,

34:56.050 --> 34:58.557
I have worked with a lot of men like you.

34:58.592 --> 35:00.463
You get off on instilling fear,

35:00.520 --> 35:03.255
'cause it makes you feel more powerful.

35:03.364 --> 35:05.873
You wouldn't know what
to do with real power.

35:12.955 --> 35:13.955
How'd it go?

35:13.980 --> 35:15.481
Is he bringing up charges?

35:15.643 --> 35:18.144
It's fine, there's nothing to worry about.

35:18.315 --> 35:19.245
Really?

35:19.280 --> 35:22.148
Yeah, it was... just a slap on the wrist.

35:24.038 --> 35:26.206
Patterson, can I talk to you for a second?

35:32.288 --> 35:35.351
You know, when I first brought my theory

35:35.430 --> 35:39.456
about Sandstorm to my superior...

35:39.526 --> 35:41.404
she laughed at me.

35:41.499 --> 35:43.640
The only proof I had that
these lone wolf attacks

35:43.677 --> 35:47.756
were connected was this
one man in a lime green hat.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.574
She thought that it was a coincidence,

35:49.609 --> 35:52.886
and that the link that I
was looking for wasn't there.

35:52.921 --> 35:55.385
She gave me the lecture,
"When you hear hoofbeats..."

35:55.435 --> 35:57.753
"...think horses, not zebras."

35:57.788 --> 36:00.223
- (chuckles)
- But...

36:00.954 --> 36:04.473
I just knew that it was connected.

36:04.508 --> 36:07.994
It made perfect sense to me
long before I could convince her.

36:08.257 --> 36:10.601
You know, Patterson,
it's not always gratifying

36:10.658 --> 36:14.039
to be the person who sees
things that no one else can see.

36:14.074 --> 36:15.692
We both know that.

36:16.525 --> 36:18.026
But it's a gift.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.702
(beeping)

36:23.838 --> 36:25.906

36:32.385 --> 36:34.921

It's six years of my life's work,

36:37.381 --> 36:41.292
everything that the NSA has on Sandstorm.

36:42.229 --> 36:43.673
(gasps)

36:43.743 --> 36:45.485
I... I'm honored.

36:46.601 --> 36:50.770
Well, your work on the
tattoos has been exceptional.

36:50.908 --> 36:53.580
I look forward to seeing
what you do with this.

37:03.178 --> 37:04.912
Come to the party.

37:05.675 --> 37:07.742
You really don't have to do that.

37:07.818 --> 37:11.721
What you said on the pier, it wasn't true.

37:13.171 --> 37:16.188
I... never thought I'd
say this again, but...

37:16.259 --> 37:17.927
if something happened to you,

37:18.167 --> 37:19.768
I'd miss you.

37:21.810 --> 37:22.810
(sighs)

37:23.270 --> 37:25.838
You're my friend, Jane.

37:25.991 --> 37:27.859

37:30.300 --> 37:32.645
Okay. I'll be there.

Yeah, and I was so excited to introduce you

37:56.043 --> 37:58.044
