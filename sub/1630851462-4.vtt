inscrutable.

11:17.677 --> 11:22.159
And so when Iraq invaded Iran,

11:22.290 --> 11:25.772
the United States
leaned on the side of Iraq.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.426
[Neyfakh] In fact,
America went further

11:28.557 --> 11:31.255
than just siding with Iraq.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.170
It struck up
a tentative partnership

11:33.301 --> 11:34.432
with Saddam Hussein,

11:34.563 --> 11:36.521
and by 1983,

11:36.652 --> 11:39.176
America was supplying Iraq
with arms.

11:39.307 --> 11:42.310
Saddam was enjoying
the support of the West,

11:42.440 --> 11:43.615
of the United States.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.922
He was buying weaponry
from them,

11:46.053 --> 11:47.924
and he could do no wrong.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.535
It was a convenient alliance.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.016
[Neyfakh] The alliance
was founded on one thing.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.279
[Boustany] Iraq was sitting
on a lot of oil.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.238
They had reserves.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.153
[man] So vast are their
reserves, that Iraqis say

11:59.283 --> 12:00.937
that the last two barrels
of oil

12:01.068 --> 12:02.547
in the world will be theirs.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.507
The U.S. didn't have
alternatives at the time

12:05.637 --> 12:08.379
to Saudi oil or Arab oil.

12:08.510 --> 12:12.340
And oil prices were a matter
of national interest

12:12.470 --> 12:16.692
and very important
to the economy of the U.S.

12:16.823 --> 12:21.131
Iran felt that its back
was against the wall.

12:21.262 --> 12:25.527
The Iraqi Air Force
was superior.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.356
They didn't have
the right kind of missiles

12:28.486 --> 12:30.314
to defend themselves.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.319
And a lot of young
Iranian soldiers

12:35.450 --> 12:37.365
died in the war.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.933
Millions died.
Many were taken prisoner.

12:54.599 --> 12:57.602
[Neyfakh] By the summer
of 1985, the bloody war

12:57.733 --> 13:01.432
between Iran and Iraq
had been raging for five years.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.348
[man] The Iranians seem to
have no intention at all

13:04.479 --> 13:08.570
of agreeing to a ceasefire,
let alone peace negotiations.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.573
The war will drag on,
continuing instability

13:11.703 --> 13:13.009
at the very heart
of the oil world.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.402
[woman] And many are wondering

13:14.532 --> 13:17.100
how long Iran
can stay in this fight

13:17.231 --> 13:19.799
without American
military assistance.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.672
[Neyfakh] To make matters
more complicated,

13:23.803 --> 13:26.066
the White House feared
that the Soviet Union

13:26.196 --> 13:28.416
was jockeying for influence
in Iran

13:28.546 --> 13:29.809
or even planning to invade.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.163
[McFarlane] Iran, I thought,
really was threatened.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.817
They were a target.

13:37.947 --> 13:41.385
The Cold War was raging
during this time,

13:41.516 --> 13:45.041
so it was crucial
that we do whatever we could

13:45.172 --> 13:47.304
to prevent an expansion

13:47.435 --> 13:49.480
of Soviet influence
in the Middle East.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.184
[Neyfakh] It was against
the backdrop

13:57.314 --> 13:59.229
of the Iran-Iraq war

13:59.360 --> 14:02.276
that in the summer of 1985,
an Iranian arms dealer

14:02.406 --> 14:04.582
by the name
of Manucher Ghorbanifar

14:04.713 --> 14:07.324
was introduced
to Bud McFarlane.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.587
Ghorbanifar claimed that
there were moderate elements

14:09.718 --> 14:11.285
within Khomeini's cabinet

14:11.415 --> 14:14.114
who wanted to engage
with the U.S.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.420
[Teicher]
McFarlane was very concerned

14:16.551 --> 14:20.424
that America
not miss an opportunity

14:20.555 --> 14:23.471
to restore
some semblance of normalcy

14:23.601 --> 14:25.647
to our relationship with Iran.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.998
Or at least stop
the radicalization

14:29.129 --> 14:30.652
and begin a process

14:30.782 --> 14:35.178
that would move them
more towards a centrist policy

14:35.309 --> 14:37.093
and a restoration
of the balance of power

14:37.224 --> 14:38.660
and the Middle East order.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.488
[Neyfakh]
That was the long-term play.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.316
In the short term,

14:42.446 --> 14:44.579
Ghorbanifar was also
promising to help Reagan

14:44.709 --> 14:46.146
out of his hostage crisis.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.235
[chanting]

14:48.365 --> 14:50.367
[Neyfakh] Extremist Shiite
militants in Lebanon,

14:50.498 --> 14:52.369
who referred to themselves
as Hezbollah,

14:52.500 --> 14:54.676
had kidnapped
seven Americans in Beirut.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.896
As far as the White House
was concerned,

14:57.026 --> 14:59.942
Hezbollah answered
to Ayatollah Khomeini.

15:00.073 --> 15:03.685
There is sufficient evidence
that radical Shia terrorists

15:03.815 --> 15:06.427
are responsive
to Iranian guidance

15:06.557 --> 15:08.646
for us to hold
Tehran responsible.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.213
[man] In the last three years,

15:10.344 --> 15:12.128
Khomeini's
fundamentalist message

15:12.259 --> 15:13.651
has found many supporters

15:13.782 --> 15:16.263
among the Shiites
of the Lebanon.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.222
Downtrodden for generations,
many now believe

15:19.353 --> 15:21.964
in an Islamic revolution
against foreign influence.

15:22.095 --> 15:25.315
[Teicher] Iranian leadership
were using the Pasdaran

15:25.446 --> 15:29.363
to train people
to become martyrs.

15:29.493 --> 15:32.279
We saw Shia unrest
in Saudi Arabia.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.934
We saw Shia unrest in Yemen.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.806
Wherever there were
Shiite communities,

15:37.937 --> 15:41.723
they were typically
the impoverished communities,

15:41.853 --> 15:45.553
and they were looking
to Iran for help.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.598
[Neyfakh]
Hezbollah had learned

15:47.729 --> 15:49.252
from the Iranian
hostage crisis

15:49.383 --> 15:51.167
how to put pressure
on the United States.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.516
[man] ...for in this city,

15:52.647 --> 15:54.431
a live hostage
is worth a lot of money.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.438
[Neyfakh] Ghorbanifar said
that he could persuade

16:01.569 --> 16:03.397
the Iranian government
to pressure Hezbollah

16:03.527 --> 16:05.529
into releasing
the seven American hostages

16:05.660 --> 16:07.618
being held in Lebanon.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.578
It was this promise
that would lead Bud McFarlane

16:10.708 --> 16:12.275
to make a fateful decision.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.103
[phone ringing]

16:14.234 --> 16:15.931
He instructed Oliver North

16:16.062 --> 16:18.368
to strike a deal
with Ghorbanifar,

16:18.499 --> 16:20.631
whereby Iran would broker
the release of the hostages.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.070
And in return,

16:24.200 --> 16:26.594
the Ayatollah would get the
one thing he really needed.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.944
[all chanting]

16:29.075 --> 16:31.164
[Boustany]
The Iranians needed weapons,

16:31.294 --> 16:33.253
and they knew that

16:33.383 --> 16:35.995
Saddam's supremacy
in the skies

16:36.125 --> 16:39.215
and with missiles
and all kinds of weaponry

16:39.346 --> 16:40.956
was because the West

16:41.087 --> 16:43.959
was supplying
these weapons to them.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.656
[Neyfakh]
There was one problem.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.658
The White House
had placed an embargo

16:47.789 --> 16:49.791
on the sale of weapons
to Iran.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.358
[McManus] There were
plenty of laws broken

16:51.488 --> 16:53.795
in the arms sales to Iran,

16:53.925 --> 16:57.755
but if a President
and his advisors decide that

16:57.886 --> 17:00.628
"we're going to find a lawyer
to write an interpretation

17:00.758 --> 17:03.283
that says that
we're within the law,"

17:04.066 --> 17:05.850
they may or may not get away
with it

17:05.981 --> 17:07.461
in the long run,

17:07.591 --> 17:09.245
but they clearly
have the power to do it

17:09.376 --> 17:10.986
in the short run.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.510
[Neyfakh]
To keep the deal secret,

17:13.641 --> 17:17.210
the Israeli government agreed
to act as a middleman.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.038
It went like this.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.475
The U.S. would sell
the missiles to Israel,

17:21.605 --> 17:24.043
and Israel would
then ship them to Iran.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.654
The plan was designed
to avoid a direct sale

17:26.784 --> 17:28.525
to a country
that the Reagan administration

17:28.656 --> 17:30.919
had designated
a state sponsor of terrorism.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.617
[McFarlane] The president had

17:33.748 --> 17:35.793
made the decision
unequivocally.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.100
He was profoundly focused

17:38.231 --> 17:41.799
on securing the release
of the hostages in Lebanon.

17:44.585 --> 17:49.068
I reminded him again that,
"Look, this may not work."

17:51.070 --> 17:54.551
And he said, "Well, Bud,
we don't know until we try."

17:56.945 --> 17:59.730
[Neyfakh] On August 20, 1985,

17:59.861 --> 18:02.559
a plane carrying
96 American TOW missiles

18:02.690 --> 18:04.648
left Israel for Iran.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.302
[McFarlane] Right away,

18:06.433 --> 18:08.391
after the President
made the decision,

18:08.522 --> 18:11.481
I began to hear
a different story.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.833
[Neyfakh] In a last-minute
bait and switch,

18:15.964 --> 18:17.748
Ghorbanifar
was saying that Iran

18:17.879 --> 18:20.577
wanted an additional
400 missiles.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.407
Even worse,
he said that only one hostage

18:24.538 --> 18:27.715
instead of all seven
would be freed in exchange.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.413
McFarlane was furious.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.980
[McFarlane]
You're being screwed here.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.069
That was my reaction to it.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.551
And I said, "Look, this is
really unimpressive

18:37.681 --> 18:41.337
"on their part
and foolish on ours

18:41.468 --> 18:43.861
if we can't get this
straightened out."

18:43.992 --> 18:46.777
[Neyfakh] Now ready to pull
the plug on the whole deal,

18:46.908 --> 18:49.215
McFarlane went back
to the president.

18:50.303 --> 18:53.480
[McFarlane] It was very clear
that that priority,

18:53.610 --> 18:55.743
the safety of Americans,

18:55.873 --> 18:57.658
is what drove him
in decision-making.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.226
He was an optimist

19:00.356 --> 19:04.055
without thinking seriously
about the downside risks here.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.449
[Neyfakh] And so,
on September 15th,

19:06.580 --> 19:09.626
a second plane
carrying 408 American missiles

19:09.757 --> 19:10.671
arrived in Iran.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.720
McFarlane had
the terrible task of choosing

19:16.851 --> 19:19.158
which one hostage
would walk free.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.467
While President Reagan
was clearly touched

19:24.598 --> 19:27.688
and wanted to bring about
freedom for the hostages,

19:27.818 --> 19:30.299
the one who he really cared
about was Bill Buckley.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.827
[McFarlane] Clearly that's
the one I favored,

19:36.958 --> 19:40.657
just out
of professional anguish.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.791
[Mayer] Of all the hostages,

19:43.921 --> 19:46.837
none hurt more than Buckley.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.883
He was our own man.

19:50.276 --> 19:54.497
He was someone
who was doing public service

19:54.628 --> 19:56.717
for the CIA
in a very dangerous post.

19:59.110 --> 20:02.636
People were very worried about
what was being done to him.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.682
The CIA reportedly spent
a small fortune to try

20:05.813 --> 20:08.468
and find William Buckley.
After he was kidnapped,

20:08.598 --> 20:10.600
Iranian gunmen
took him to Tehran.

20:10.731 --> 20:13.212
He reportedly was tortured
there till he gave up secrets

20:13.342 --> 20:15.475
and then sent back
to his Lebanese captors

20:15.605 --> 20:16.606
and forced
to write a confession.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.696
[Neyfakh] Earlier that year,

20:19.827 --> 20:22.221
Hezbollah had released
a video of William Buckley.

20:34.972 --> 20:37.801
The video proved
that Buckley was still alive,

20:37.932 --> 20:40.456
but only just.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.632
The situation was dire,

20:42.763 --> 20:45.461
both in terms of Buckley's
obviously ailing health

20:45.592 --> 20:46.854
and the classified information

20:46.984 --> 20:48.769
he could be giving up
under torture.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.600
But despite McFarland's pleas
to release him first,

20:53.730 --> 20:55.558
he was told that Buckley
was too sick to travel.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.388
McFarlane would have
to pick someone else.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.522

21:02.652 --> 21:05.916
"Well, there's this pastor."

The pastor was Benjamin Weir.

Do you think the government
has been doing

21:12.271 --> 21:14.708
all it can to gain his release?

21:14.838 --> 21:17.624
I think a special effort
needs to be made now.

an obvious second choice.

22:37.138 --> 22:40.359
-has now been released.
-[cheers and applause]

22:40.489 --> 22:42.230
[woman] Today's news brought
renewed hope for the families

22:42.361 --> 22:44.972
of the six Americans
still held hostage.

22:45.102 --> 22:48.149
The heaviness of one's heart
is lightened some.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.020
I want to have
a positive attitude,

22:50.151 --> 22:52.240
and be optimistic,
and think that this is

22:52.371 --> 22:55.025
the first step in the release
towards all of the people.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.811
[Neyfakh] No one knew
that Weir had been released

22:57.941 --> 23:01.771
in an arms-for-hostages deal,
not even Weir himself.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.599
[man] Because the
six other hostages

23:03.730 --> 23:04.992
have not yet been freed,

23:05.122 --> 23:08.169
we do not intend
to disclose any details

23:08.299 --> 23:10.389
on how the Reverend Weir
was freed.

23:11.781 --> 23:14.871
However, I can assure you
that no deal was made

23:15.002 --> 23:16.351
and that our position

23:16.482 --> 23:19.876
on no concessions
to terrorists has not changed.

23:20.007 --> 23:23.837
[dramatic music plays]

23:23.967 --> 23:25.926
[Teicher]
I asked Colonel North,

23:26.056 --> 23:28.929
who was the only one who would
know about this sort of thing,

23:29.059 --> 23:33.281
and he just gave me
his special grin

23:33.412 --> 23:35.283
and the twinkle in his eye.

23:35.414 --> 23:40.070
Which was his way of saying,
"Yes, something's going on."

23:46.773 --> 23:50.037
We went to Washington, D.C.,

23:50.167 --> 23:53.040
and at the church's offices
on Capitol Hill,

23:53.170 --> 23:54.607
my father held
a press conference.

23:54.737 --> 23:56.217
For the first time,

23:56.347 --> 23:58.915
he spoke to the press
about what had happened.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.048
I hardly need to say
that I'm glad to be here.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.271
Not least, but first of all,

24:07.402 --> 24:10.797
I give credit and praise

24:10.927 --> 24:12.973
to our Heavenly Father

24:13.103 --> 24:16.150
for his tender,
sustaining power

24:16.280 --> 24:17.934
throughout this ordeal,

24:18.065 --> 24:20.197
for my release

24:20.328 --> 24:22.678
and for the hope that,
by his grace,

24:22.809 --> 24:24.680
freedom will come soon

24:24.811 --> 24:26.726
to those who are still captive.

24:26.856 --> 24:28.684
-Hi. How are you?
-Well, thank you.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.294
[Neyfakh] Weir's release

24:30.425 --> 24:33.167
was a significant
public victory for Reagan.

24:33.297 --> 24:35.865
Behind the scenes, the
administration was struggling

24:35.996 --> 24:37.867
to secure the release
of the remaining hostages.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.436
We are continuing to hope

24:41.567 --> 24:44.787
and continuing
to do everything we can.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.528
[woman] The families say
you're not doing enough.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.402
Well, unfortunately,
we can't tell even the families

24:51.533 --> 24:53.492
all the things
that we are doing.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.192
[Neyfakh] Fear for
the hostages' lives

24:58.322 --> 25:00.977
weighed heavily on Reagan
and on the country.

25:01.108 --> 25:05.068
They cohabitated
with rodents and cockroaches.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.462
They were moved
from place to place.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.812
They were wrapped
like mummies with rags

25:09.943 --> 25:12.728
stuffed into their mouths
tied to radiators.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.904
Many of them were beaten.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.472
I mean, these men
really suffered.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.387
[Neyfakh]
What was not yet known

25:19.518 --> 25:21.258
was that William Buckley,

25:21.389 --> 25:24.523
the CIA station chief,
had been dead for months.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.350
[Mayer] And of course,
it turned out later,

25:26.481 --> 25:29.092
long before anybody
in the U.S. knew it,

25:29.223 --> 25:32.835
he was horribly tortured
and murdered.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.141
[man]The Post says
that Buckley later died

25:34.271 --> 25:35.664
from a lack
of medical attention.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.579
His body was never found.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.408
[Neyfakh] The question now
was what to do next?

25:40.539 --> 25:43.237
Reagan wanted McFarlane
to negotiate the release

25:43.367 --> 25:45.587
of the remaining hostages,

25:45.718 --> 25:48.938
but McFarlane no longer
trusted Ghorbanifar to serve

25:49.069 --> 25:52.420
as a reliable intermediary
between the U.S. and Iran.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.727
[McFarlane] Unless you have
absolute conviction

25:54.857 --> 25:56.816
in the integrity

25:56.946 --> 25:59.035
of the people
you're dealing with,

25:59.166 --> 26:02.778
a barter for hostages
is just an open door

26:02.909 --> 26:06.956
to encouraging
more hostages being taken.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.828
From the Iranian
point of view,

26:08.958 --> 26:11.134
if it works,
let's do it again.

26:11.265 --> 26:15.182
And so I was suspicious.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.010
And I was candid
with Reagan about that.

26:19.142 --> 26:20.230
[Neyfakh]
As it turned out,

26:20.361 --> 26:22.450
McFarlane was right
to be skeptical.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.408
Ghorbanifar was, in fact,

26:24.539 --> 26:26.933
something of a triple agent,
if you like.

26:28.543 --> 26:33.417
In his career, he had worked
for the regime of the Shah.

26:33.548 --> 26:37.552
He had worked for
United States intelligence.

26:37.683 --> 26:41.469
He had worked
for Israeli intelligence.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.342
And by the time we got
to know him in the 1980s,

26:45.473 --> 26:49.608
he was working for the Iranian
revolutionary regime.

26:49.738 --> 26:53.394
He was a classic
international wheeler-dealer

26:53.524 --> 26:56.876
who didn't care
what side you were on.

26:57.006 --> 27:00.488
All he wanted to do
was make a deal.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.230
[McFarlane] The more
I learned about Ghorbanifar,

27:03.360 --> 27:05.754
it was very clear that
he was neither a principal,

27:05.885 --> 27:07.234
a decision-maker,

27:07.364 --> 27:10.498
nor a person
of particular influence

27:10.629 --> 27:13.283
with the Iranian armed forces.

27:13.414 --> 27:16.504
Nothing that he said really
established his bona fides

27:16.635 --> 27:19.028
apart from having a history

27:19.159 --> 27:22.292
of being involved
in arms trade.

27:22.423 --> 27:24.294
[Neyfakh]
During this same period,

27:24.425 --> 27:27.297
McFarlane turned his attention
away from Iran

27:27.428 --> 27:31.388
and towards America's other
global foe: the Soviet Union.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.652
[marching band music plays]

27:33.782 --> 27:36.132
McFarlane was planning
the first ever meeting

27:36.263 --> 27:38.004
between Reagan
and his Soviet counterpart,

27:38.134 --> 27:40.136
Mikhail Gorbachev.

27:40.267 --> 27:42.008
As the summit neared,

27:42.138 --> 27:44.619
McFarlane handed full control
of negotiations

27:44.750 --> 27:46.665
with Ghorbanifar off
to Oliver North.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.972
He was North's problem now.

27:50.103 --> 27:53.149
[McFarlane] I had
a challenging six months

27:53.280 --> 27:55.282
planning the Soviet summit

27:55.412 --> 27:57.980
to tee up
both sides' understanding

27:58.111 --> 28:01.157
of what was to be
the outcome in Geneva.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.638
[Neyfakh] The topic of
these diplomatic negotiations,

28:03.769 --> 28:05.596
ironically,
was weapons reduction.

28:05.727 --> 28:08.556
We go to Geneva
with the sober realization

28:08.687 --> 28:12.342
that nuclear weapons pose the
greatest threat in human history

28:12.473 --> 28:14.605
to the survival
of the human race,

28:14.736 --> 28:16.999
that the arms race
must be stopped.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.915
[chatter]

28:21.438 --> 28:23.571
[Neyfakh] McFarlane spent
months tutoring Reagan

28:23.702 --> 28:26.443
on the details of arms control.

28:26.574 --> 28:28.054
Ronald Reagan
was never a detail man.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.056
Not on foreign policy.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.754
Not on domestic policy.

28:32.885 --> 28:36.323
His aides would tell stories
about his eyes glazing over.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.151
It was revealed that

28:38.281 --> 28:41.720
before his meetings
with foreign leaders,

28:41.850 --> 28:45.506
instead of a big binder
of printed material of the kind

28:45.636 --> 28:47.987
that the CIA
would have customarily

28:48.117 --> 28:50.772
given to a president
before a summit,

28:50.903 --> 28:55.211
the CIA had prepared a movie
about Mikhail Gorbachev,

28:55.342 --> 28:56.996
a mini documentary,

28:57.126 --> 28:59.128
so that he could absorb
the information that way.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.303
And the President
was delighted.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.963
[man]
The November summit arrives,

29:08.094 --> 29:09.617
and the world
is watching closely

29:09.748 --> 29:11.401
to see if the tensions

29:11.532 --> 29:14.056
will remain as icy
as the Geneva weather.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.973
[Neyfakh]
On November 19, 1985,

29:18.104 --> 29:20.410
Reagan and Gorbachev
met in Switzerland.

29:20.541 --> 29:23.413
[applause]

29:26.852 --> 29:28.418
General Secretary Gorbachev
and I

29:28.549 --> 29:30.638
have held
comprehensive discussions

29:30.769 --> 29:33.554
covering all elements
of our relationship.

29:34.555 --> 29:37.166
I'm convinced that we are
heading in the right direction.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.516
[applause]

29:39.647 --> 29:41.083
[Neyfakh] Both men agreed

29:41.214 --> 29:42.911
to consider reducing
their stockpiles

29:43.042 --> 29:44.652
of nuclear weapons,

29:44.783 --> 29:47.133
but Reagan refused
to compromise on his dream

29:47.263 --> 29:49.265
of building a missile
defense system in space.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.965
Ultimately, no deal was signed.

29:56.969 --> 30:01.451
Meanwhile, McFarlane was losing
control of Oliver North

30:01.582 --> 30:04.150
who was continuing to give in
to Ghorbanifar's demands

30:04.280 --> 30:06.413
for more and more weapons.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.937
[McFarlane] The Iranians
wanted sophisticated

30:09.068 --> 30:10.634
air-to-air missiles

30:10.765 --> 30:14.073
before anyone else
would be released.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.162
Well, it was out
of the question.

30:16.292 --> 30:19.774
This was a particularly
sophisticated system

30:19.905 --> 30:23.299
that we weren't even selling
to all of our allies,

30:23.430 --> 30:26.085
let alone to
an alien country like Iran.

30:28.652 --> 30:30.611
This really was a marker

30:30.741 --> 30:35.137
of the good faith
being very much in doubt.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.400
[Neyfakh] Nevertheless,
with no oversight,

30:37.531 --> 30:40.142
Oliver North persisted.

30:40.273 --> 30:43.754
Iran was asking
for 150 HAWK missiles

30:43.885 --> 30:46.061
as well as 200
Sidewinder missiles

30:46.192 --> 30:48.498
and 30 to 50 Phoenix missiles.

30:48.629 --> 30:51.588
But this time, it was America
that changed the terms.

30:51.719 --> 30:54.548
A plane carrying
just 18 Hawk missiles

30:54.678 --> 30:56.115
touched down in Iran.

31:00.423 --> 31:03.383
In addition to the drastically
reduced number of weapons,

31:03.513 --> 31:04.819
they weren't even the I-Hawks

31:04.950 --> 31:06.821
capable of
shooting down planes

31:06.952 --> 31:09.650
at high altitudes
the Iranians had ordered.

31:09.780 --> 31:12.174
On top of that,
about half the missiles

31:12.305 --> 31:14.611
carried Israeli's
Star of David markings,

31:14.742 --> 31:16.657
which enraged the Iranians.

31:16.787 --> 31:18.964
No hostages were released.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.445
A week later, deflated
from the Geneva summit

31:22.576 --> 31:23.882
and from what
looked increasingly

31:24.012 --> 31:25.666
like dead-end negotiations
with Iran,

31:25.796 --> 31:27.624
McFarlane had had enough.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.800
[McFarlane] I was exhausted.

31:29.931 --> 31:33.500
Their request for a much more
sophisticated weapons system,

31:33.630 --> 31:36.633
their lack of production
of releasing a hostage

31:36.764 --> 31:40.942
led me to formally ask for
a meeting with the president.

31:41.073 --> 31:44.685
I was reaching a point where,
more for family reasons,

31:44.815 --> 31:47.601
I wanted to retire.

31:47.731 --> 31:49.690
His ability to weigh
both sides of an issue

31:49.820 --> 31:53.302
and to provide key advice
has been invaluable.

31:53.433 --> 31:57.654
[McFarlane] And we had a long
and rather emotional,

31:57.785 --> 32:01.484
mutual sorrow to the point

32:01.615 --> 32:04.705
of his being distraught
at my leaving,

32:04.835 --> 32:07.316
and he wanted me
to reconsider.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.536
I said,
"I really can't do that.

32:09.666 --> 32:12.713
I'm sorry to let you down."

32:12.843 --> 32:16.760
At the end, he very clearly,
reluctantly said, "All right."

32:16.891 --> 32:18.501
[Neyfakh]
McFarlane's parting wisdom

32:18.632 --> 32:20.373
was that all negotiations

32:20.503 --> 32:23.332
with Iranian arms dealers
should cease.

32:23.463 --> 32:26.379
[McFarlane] The president
was pursed lips all the way,

32:26.509 --> 32:29.338
as was his way
of showing his wish

32:29.469 --> 32:31.384
to go in the opposite direction

32:31.514 --> 32:33.560
that he thought
it worth continuing.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.911
But at the end,
he said, "All right,"

32:37.042 --> 32:39.218
and he directed me
to go to London.

32:42.395 --> 32:45.354
[Neyfakh] On December 7th,
McFarlane flew to London

32:45.485 --> 32:47.574
for what would be his final
international mission

32:47.704 --> 32:49.619
as national security advisor.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.144
Ghorbanifar and Oliver North
were there waiting for him.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.580
[McFarlane] I said,

32:53.710 --> 32:55.103
"My government
simply is not interested

32:55.234 --> 32:57.366
"in pursuing what we think

32:57.497 --> 33:00.979
is evidence of bad faith here
on the Iranian side.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.938
There would be no arms
transfers at all."

33:04.069 --> 33:06.506
[Neyfakh]
Ghorbanifar was livid.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.508
[McFarlane] He stormed around.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.902
Said, "You're foolish, you're
crazy, you're misguided.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.949
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime."

33:15.080 --> 33:19.388
I said, "Ollie, it's over.
Let's get out of here."

33:21.303 --> 33:23.392
And we left.

33:25.438 --> 33:28.745
I have a statement
I wish to read to you.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.531
It's with deep regret
and reluctance

33:31.661 --> 33:35.361
that I have accepted
the resignation of Bud McFarlane

33:35.491 --> 33:38.668
as my assistant
for National Security Affairs.

33:38.799 --> 33:40.670
While Bud's departure
is a cause

33:40.801 --> 33:43.238
of deep regret for me,

33:43.369 --> 33:44.935
I'm pleased to announce

33:45.066 --> 33:47.851
that I have appointed
Vice Admiral John M. Poindexter

33:47.982 --> 33:49.549
to be the new assistant
to the president

33:49.679 --> 33:51.594
for National Security Affairs.

33:52.726 --> 33:55.033
[Neyfakh] As McFarlane
cleared out his office,

33:55.163 --> 33:57.339
he feared that Reagan
would turn his attention

33:57.470 --> 33:59.037
back to Iran.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.691
[McFarlane] I knew that
his preoccupation

34:01.822 --> 34:03.867
with the safety
of the hostages

34:03.998 --> 34:06.827
would lead him to start
this process up again.

34:07.784 --> 34:10.570
I nonetheless tabled
my resignation and left,

34:10.700 --> 34:12.137
and I shouldn't have done it.

34:13.312 --> 34:16.184
The only person that could
have stopped it was me.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.187
And I didn't do it.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.625
[Neyfakh]
McFarlane was right.

34:22.756 --> 34:24.627
Negotiations
between Oliver North

34:24.758 --> 34:26.673
and Manucher Ghorbanifar
resumed.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.502
To North, the only downside

34:29.632 --> 34:31.765
of further arms-for-hostages
transactions

34:31.895 --> 34:35.595
was a few weapons being sent
to Iran with no results.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.424
On the other hand,
if the deals stopped,

34:38.554 --> 34:40.948
the hostages
could come to severe harm.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.778
[man] In January of 1986,

34:44.908 --> 34:47.737
after I had become
a national security advisor

34:47.868 --> 34:51.524
in December,
I convened an NSPG meeting

34:51.654 --> 34:53.700
with the director
of central intelligence,

34:53.830 --> 34:55.963
Bill Casey.

34:56.094 --> 35:01.577
And Bill Casey picked retired
Air Force General Dick Secord

35:01.708 --> 35:05.929
to be the contractor
to manage the logistics

35:06.060 --> 35:10.673
of getting the weapons
from the U.S. to Iran.

35:11.370 --> 35:13.328
[Neyfakh] Richard Secord
was still buying weapons

35:13.459 --> 35:15.069
and building an air fleet

35:15.200 --> 35:17.898
with American money
for the Contras in Nicaragua.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.943
In his new role,
he would also be in charge

35:20.074 --> 35:22.903
of funneling
U.S. weapons to Iran.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.732
So they decided
that I ought to take over

35:25.862 --> 35:28.778
that whole operation,
which was growing and growing.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.780
Well, that was the last thing
we needed.

35:30.911 --> 35:34.306
But suddenly,
we find ourselves involved

35:34.436 --> 35:36.699
in the Iran part of this mess.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.924
[Neyfakh] On January 22nd,
North flew to London again

35:44.054 --> 35:46.361
to turn up the heat
on Ghorbanifar.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.408
If negotiations were
going to continue,

35:49.538 --> 35:53.020
the hostages needed
to be released and soon.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.458
This meeting would later
become publicly known as...

35:56.589 --> 35:58.547
The bathroom story.

35:58.678 --> 36:01.071
[Neyfakh] And that story
goes something like this...

36:01.202 --> 36:02.595
[McManus] North
and Ghorbanifar

36:02.725 --> 36:05.554
and others were in London
in a hotel room.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.730
The negotiations
were getting nowhere,

36:07.861 --> 36:09.515
and according to North,

36:09.645 --> 36:11.560
Ghorbanifar asked him
to step into the bathroom...

36:13.780 --> 36:17.392
and said, "There has to be
"a way to make this deal work.

36:17.523 --> 36:20.743
I can just write you
a check for $1 million."

36:21.309 --> 36:23.529
North recognized that he was,
in effect,

36:23.659 --> 36:25.748
being offered a bribe.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.838
And North, in his accounting,
bristled and said,

36:28.969 --> 36:30.623
"No, I can't do
anything like that."

36:30.753 --> 36:32.842
At which point
Ghorbanifar said,

36:32.973 --> 36:37.804
"Well, what if I sent the money
"to an account for the Contras?

36:37.934 --> 36:39.762
Would that help?"

36:39.893 --> 36:41.808
At which point,
according to North,

36:41.938 --> 36:44.463
he said, "Now, that's
an interesting idea."

36:44.593 --> 36:47.857
And thus was
the diversion begun.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.555
[Neyfakh] And so,
as the story goes,

36:49.685 --> 36:51.078
it was in a London bathroom

36:51.209 --> 36:53.950
that North's two big missions
became one.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.822
And the twin-engine scandal,

36:55.952 --> 36:59.478
now known as Iran-Contra,
was born.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.306
It became apparent
to Ollie North

37:01.436 --> 37:04.439
that he had just found a way to
solve two problems, he thought.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.876
One was getting the hostages
out of Iran,

37:07.007 --> 37:10.750
and the other was getting money
to the Contras in Nicaragua.

37:10.880 --> 37:16.451
I, at the time, thought that it
was a really neat idea

37:16.582 --> 37:18.714
to use Khomeini's money

37:18.845 --> 37:22.588
to support the indigenous forces
in Nicaragua

37:22.718 --> 37:24.242
where we were trying

37:24.372 --> 37:28.246
to roll back
the Communist Marxist state.

37:28.376 --> 37:31.292
The Iranian program
was controversial.

37:31.423 --> 37:35.557
I've often told people
I specialize in controversies,

37:35.688 --> 37:38.517
but I thought
it made a lot of sense.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.650
In the later retelling
of Ollie North,

37:41.781 --> 37:44.044
the idea of diverting money

37:44.174 --> 37:47.134
from Iranian arms sales
to the Contras

37:47.265 --> 37:51.791
actually came from Ghorbanifar,
the Iranian arms merchant.

37:51.921 --> 37:55.055
The problem with that story,
as charming as it is,

37:55.185 --> 37:58.493
is that it is
almost certainly untrue.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.757
[Neyfakh] In fact, by
the time North and Ghorbanifar

38:01.888 --> 38:04.107
had their dubious
bathroom conversation,

38:04.238 --> 38:08.286
Secord had already diverted
more than $850,000

38:08.416 --> 38:10.723
from Iranian arms sales
to Nicaragua,

38:10.853 --> 38:12.855
a transaction Secord
would jokingly refer

38:12.986 --> 38:14.683
to as a Contra-bution.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.859
We only had
a small amount of money,

38:16.990 --> 38:18.948
and we were eating it up
very rapidly.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.951
Air operations
are very expensive.

38:22.082 --> 38:24.693
And procuring these weapons
was very expensive.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.000
And buying
and operating a ship,

38:27.130 --> 38:28.958
that was pretty expensive.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.918
You know, and we needed
additional funds,

38:32.048 --> 38:35.313
and this came along.
We said, "Eh, how about this?

38:35.443 --> 38:38.707
It's a good way.
We'll tap into that," and did.

38:39.795 --> 38:41.971
[Neyfakh] Now under
Richard Secord's direction,

38:42.102 --> 38:44.626
Operation Recovery
was launched.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.150
It was a complex order
of operations

38:47.281 --> 38:50.850
that was designed specifically
to uphold one thing: secrecy.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.767
And it went like this.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.943
Ghorbanifar
would deposit funds

38:57.073 --> 39:00.381
into a Swiss bank account
controlled by Secord.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.427
Secord would then transfer
a portion of that money

39:02.557 --> 39:04.385
to the CIA,

39:04.516 --> 39:07.606
which would purchase
the missiles from the U.S. Army.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.825
Secord would then
charter a plane

39:09.956 --> 39:12.828
to ferry the missiles
from the U.S. to Israel.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.483
Finally, an Israeli charter
would carry the weapons

39:15.614 --> 39:16.876
on their last leg to Iran.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.968
A shipment of 500 TOW missiles
arrived in Iran

39:22.098 --> 39:24.274
on February 18th.

39:24.405 --> 39:27.365
But once again,
no hostages were released.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.846
Just under two weeks later,

39:30.977 --> 39:34.241
an additional 500 TOW missiles
were delivered to Iran.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.200
Again, no hostages were freed.

39:37.331 --> 39:39.986
North had now overseen
five shipments

39:40.116 --> 39:42.162
of lethal weapons to Iran,

39:42.292 --> 39:43.903
and it had been months
since the first

39:44.033 --> 39:44.947
and only hostage
had been freed.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.735
But in the meantime,
as much as $20 million

39:49.865 --> 39:51.911
had piled up in Secord's
Swiss bank account.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.132
The war in Nicaragua

39:56.263 --> 39:58.874
was now just
as dependent on Iran

39:59.005 --> 40:01.268
as the fate of the hostages
in Beirut.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.923
It was time for a face-to-face
meeting with the enemy.

40:08.014 --> 40:10.277
[McManus] McFarlane's visit
to Tehran in May

40:10.408 --> 40:14.890
was the point
at which all of his illusions

40:15.021 --> 40:17.676
about the possibilities
of a deal with Iran

40:17.806 --> 40:20.809
crashed into
a brick wall of reality.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.465
[Neyfakh]
In the spring of 1986,

40:24.596 --> 40:27.207
Reagan called Bud McFarlane
out of retirement

40:27.337 --> 40:29.688
to spearhead
a top secret mission.

40:29.818 --> 40:32.081
[McFarlane]
And I agreed to go

40:32.212 --> 40:35.476
when I was asked
by the president to go to Iran.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.043
[Neyfakh] He would be
traveling with a small team.

40:37.173 --> 40:41.221
My name is George Cave,
and I was in the CIA,

40:41.351 --> 40:43.832
and I focused
on the Middle East.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.747
[Neyfakh] Howard Teicher

40:45.878 --> 40:47.140
and Lieutenant
Colonel Oliver North.

40:52.188 --> 40:54.103
Ghorbanifar claimed
that he had arranged

40:54.234 --> 40:56.671
for McFarlane and his team
to meet with men

40:56.802 --> 40:59.369
in Khomeini's inner circle.

40:59.500 --> 41:04.026
[Poindexter] We hadn't had any
diplomatic approach to Iran

41:04.157 --> 41:05.985
up to that point.

41:06.115 --> 41:11.251
And so it was momentous
to decide to send a mission.

41:11.381 --> 41:14.341
[Neyfakh] America hadn't sent
a White House delegation to Iran

41:14.472 --> 41:16.604
since the hostage crisis
six years earlier.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.128
Our hope was that
we would actually sit down

41:19.259 --> 41:26.092
with Speaker Rafsanjani,
Mousavi, the prime minister.

41:26.222 --> 41:29.399
[Neyfakh] This had
always been McFarlane's goal--

41:29.530 --> 41:31.576
to determine,
once and for all,

41:31.706 --> 41:36.015
if a relationship between Iran
and the U.S. could be brokered.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.147
He saw this as
an important moment

41:38.278 --> 41:40.149
to make a difference

41:40.280 --> 41:43.979
in the course
of American history

41:44.110 --> 41:45.807
in the Middle East.

41:46.852 --> 41:48.810
[Neyfakh] This could be
McFarlane's Kissinger moment.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.813
As for Reagan,

41:51.944 --> 41:54.381
he was being promised what
he had wanted all along,

41:54.512 --> 41:56.122
the immediate release

41:56.252 --> 41:58.994
of all remaining
American hostages in Lebanon.

41:59.908 --> 42:02.345
Everyone did not think
this was a good idea.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.783
This was a high-stakes gamble.

42:04.913 --> 42:08.526
The trip was supported
by the CIA,

42:08.656 --> 42:10.266
and it was opposed
by the State Department

42:10.397 --> 42:12.965
and the Defense Department.

42:14.096 --> 42:16.795
[Neyfakh] The operation
was completely covert.

42:16.925 --> 42:18.536
Not even Congress
knew about it,

42:18.666 --> 42:20.712
and just a handful of Iranians
were aware

42:20.842 --> 42:22.148
that an American delegation,

42:22.278 --> 42:24.280
along with several tons
of weapons parts,

42:24.411 --> 42:26.848
were boarding a plane
bound for Tehran.

42:26.979 --> 42:30.243
[Secord] We borrowed
an airplane from Israel.

42:30.373 --> 42:32.811
We went over every bit
of that airplane,

42:32.941 --> 42:35.335
and anything
that would indicate

42:35.465 --> 42:38.730
it was Israeli,
Stars of David or whatever,

42:38.860 --> 42:41.384
we got rid of it.

42:41.515 --> 42:46.302
And we take off
in this unmarked, white 707.

42:47.347 --> 42:49.915
We had Irish passports,
and we had an Irish story,

42:50.045 --> 42:53.005
because we were going
as an Irish trade delegation.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.703
My Irish name was Tim McGann,
from Dingle.

42:59.402 --> 43:00.752
[Neyfakh] Determined
to make a good impression

43:00.882 --> 43:02.362
on the Iranians,

43:02.492 --> 43:04.320
North decided
to sweeten the deal.

43:09.325 --> 43:10.849
Of course,
the funny story on the plane

43:10.979 --> 43:13.808
was Ollie
pulling out this cake.

43:13.939 --> 43:15.767
And I said, "What is this?"

43:17.943 --> 43:20.989
[McManus] It was a regular
old chocolate cake

43:21.120 --> 43:23.557
with a great, big brass key

43:23.688 --> 43:25.603
pressed into the frosting,
on top.

43:25.733 --> 43:28.736
[Cave] The key represents
the opening of relations

43:28.867 --> 43:29.868
between the two countries.

43:32.261 --> 43:34.220
[Teicher] And indeed, there
is a tradition among Persians

43:34.350 --> 43:37.397
when families or individuals
try to make up,

43:37.527 --> 43:39.181
after some kind of fight,

43:39.312 --> 43:40.922
they share pastries
and cookies and cakes.

43:42.707 --> 43:46.928
So it was
an appropriate gift to bring

43:47.059 --> 43:49.627
as a light-hearted

43:49.757 --> 43:52.760
but, nonetheless,
symbolic gesture on our part.

43:55.067 --> 43:58.287
[McManus] Unfortunately,
when they arrived in Iran

43:58.418 --> 44:00.768
and wanted to present this key
to senior Iranian leaders,

44:00.899 --> 44:03.815
they never got a chance,

44:03.945 --> 44:06.513
because the young guards

44:06.644 --> 44:09.255
providing security for them
at their hotel suite

44:09.385 --> 44:10.822
found the cake
and ate it first.

44:13.302 --> 44:15.391
That's a pretty good metaphor
for the whole trip.

44:16.479 --> 44:19.004
[Neyfakh] Reagan had also
given the men a signed Bible

44:19.134 --> 44:22.137
to take with them.
It was a gesture to indicate

44:22.268 --> 44:24.313
that they were representing
the president

44:24.444 --> 44:26.098
and that Reagan, too,
was a man of God.

44:32.278 --> 44:36.456
Well, I was very concerned
that there be a plan

44:36.586 --> 44:38.501
to rescue us
if we were held hostage.

44:38.632 --> 44:41.069
So I specifically

44:41.200 --> 44:43.637
and repeatedly
asked Oliver North,

44:43.768 --> 44:46.422
"What is the plan
for extricating us

44:46.553 --> 44:49.164
"in the event that we can't
just drive to the airport

44:49.295 --> 44:51.253
and get on our airplane?"

44:52.037 --> 44:56.041
And Ollie assured me that
everything was taken care of.

44:56.171 --> 44:58.739
[Neyfakh] What North meant
but told no one

44:58.870 --> 45:02.308
was that William Casey,
using a classic CIA tactic,

45:02.438 --> 45:04.223
had handed him cyanide pills

45:04.353 --> 45:07.226
in the event that the mission
went horribly wrong.

45:07.356 --> 45:10.185
And before the American
delegation had even landed,

45:10.316 --> 45:12.840
it almost did

45:12.971 --> 45:14.755
when Iranian control ops

45:14.886 --> 45:17.932
picked up the jet's approach
and radioed the pilot.

45:18.063 --> 45:19.151
[Cave] They said, you know,

45:19.281 --> 45:20.761
"Either tell us
what's going on,

45:20.892 --> 45:23.503
or I'm gonna shoot you down."
And so we explained,

45:23.633 --> 45:26.071
and I gave them
the name of the man

45:26.201 --> 45:29.422
in the prime minister's office
who they should contact.

45:29.552 --> 45:31.293
And they apparently did,

45:31.424 --> 45:34.732
because we were not threatened
after that.

45:34.862 --> 45:37.996
[Neyfakh] But that was only
the beginning of their troubles.

45:38.126 --> 45:40.128
[Teicher] From the moment
we arrived,

45:40.259 --> 45:43.523
the atmosphere was bizarre.

45:43.653 --> 45:45.264
They had apparently changed
their clocks,

45:45.394 --> 45:47.005
and we didn't know it.

45:47.135 --> 45:49.050
And they were expecting us
at a different time.

45:50.095 --> 45:54.142
And we were set off
into some, uh,

45:54.273 --> 45:58.190
I'd say,
second-class VIP lounge.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.019
And we stayed there
for about an hour-plus

46:01.149 --> 46:06.285
until Ghorbanifar
showed up apologizing.

46:06.415 --> 46:08.635
[Neyfakh] The logistics screw-up
was disconcerting,

46:08.766 --> 46:10.768
but it was a small price to pay

46:10.898 --> 46:12.682
if the rest of
the mission went well.

46:12.813 --> 46:15.511
[Teicher] We said, "Well,
have the hostages been freed?"

46:15.642 --> 46:17.078
That was what we were told
when we arrived.

46:19.254 --> 46:20.778
And there was no news,

46:20.908 --> 46:24.259
and so the main thing
they were supposed to do

46:24.390 --> 46:27.175
on arrival wasn't happening.

46:29.874 --> 46:31.440
[Neyfakh] This
was starting to feel

46:31.571 --> 46:33.007
like a futile exercise,
at best,

46:33.138 --> 46:34.922
and a trap, at worst.

46:36.837 --> 46:40.406
And then we piled into
these old Oldsmobiles,

46:40.536 --> 46:42.277
and we're driven
from the airport

46:42.408 --> 46:44.453
to the former Tehran Hilton,

46:44.584 --> 46:46.325
now known as
the Imperial Hotel.

46:46.455 --> 46:49.589
There we were ensconced
on the top-floor penthouse,

46:49.719 --> 46:50.938
cut off from everyone.

46:52.287 --> 46:53.593
[Neyfakh] And thus began

46:53.723 --> 46:55.116
a strange and frustrating
three days.

46:57.423 --> 47:00.556
[Teicher] There was really
no food in this hotel.

47:00.687 --> 47:02.558
They'd come out
with this big menu.

47:02.689 --> 47:04.778
100 items on the menu.
And you would say,

47:04.909 --> 47:06.519
"Wow, this sounds great.
I'll have this."

47:06.649 --> 47:08.129
"We don't have it."

47:08.260 --> 47:09.478
Turned out they had
nothing on the menu.

47:09.609 --> 47:11.219
They had a pancake.

47:12.525 --> 47:15.223
[Neyfakh] The American envoy
had shown up during Ramadan,

47:15.354 --> 47:16.659
the month when devout Muslims

47:16.790 --> 47:18.139
fast from sunrise
till sundown.

47:20.402 --> 47:22.100
[Teicher] So Ghorbanifar
had, I believe,

47:22.230 --> 47:25.799
his mother prepare
a feast for us,

47:25.930 --> 47:28.584
which we did enjoy.
But, you know,

47:28.715 --> 47:31.239
that was about the only thing
that he delivered that he said

47:31.370 --> 47:33.589
he was gonna deliver that was
what he said it would be.

47:34.939 --> 47:36.462
[Neyfakh] Holed up in
the less-than-luxurious

47:36.592 --> 47:38.551
confines of the Tehran Hilton,

47:38.681 --> 47:40.770
they began negotiating.

47:40.901 --> 47:43.338
McFarlane expected
to be talking

47:43.469 --> 47:45.297
to the most senior leaders.

47:45.427 --> 47:48.909
He was there as a personal
emissary of the United States.

47:49.040 --> 47:54.175
He found himself talking to
arms dealers and underlings

47:54.306 --> 47:57.831
whose real connection to power
wasn't clear at all.

47:57.962 --> 48:00.181
[Neyfakh] Worse still,
it was becoming clear

48:00.312 --> 48:02.749
that the Iranians hadn't
even contacted Hezbollah

48:02.880 --> 48:05.534
to discuss the hostage
release in Lebanon.

48:05.665 --> 48:09.103
We were having substantive
dialogue about our goals

48:09.234 --> 48:10.452
and our interests,

48:10.583 --> 48:12.585
and, you know,

48:12.715 --> 48:14.892
where we thought
we could possibly cooperate.

48:15.022 --> 48:16.894
And what could be
an opening to improvement?

48:17.024 --> 48:19.418
And then we would suddenly,
you know, say,

48:19.548 --> 48:20.723
"But we're not gonna
talk anymore

48:20.854 --> 48:22.812
unless you release
the hostages."

48:22.943 --> 48:24.379
And then the Iranians
would say,

48:24.510 --> 48:27.861
"Well, we can't even
try to influence them

48:27.992 --> 48:30.211
until you deliver
all the spare parts."

48:30.342 --> 48:32.866
Because indeed,
because of our mistrust

48:32.997 --> 48:35.347
and their past failure
to deliver,

48:35.477 --> 48:38.176
we didn't bring
all of the parts with us

48:38.306 --> 48:40.700
that they wanted.
Only some of them.

48:40.830 --> 48:43.398
So it was a very
frustrating experience

48:43.529 --> 48:47.272
where McFarlane
was increasingly fed up

48:47.402 --> 48:49.317
and just ready to leave.

48:49.448 --> 48:51.537
[Cave] McFarlane would insist

48:51.667 --> 48:53.931
they've gotta
release hostages.

48:54.061 --> 48:57.543
That was our instructions
when we came here--

48:57.673 --> 49:00.372
to make sure that
the hostages get released

49:00.502 --> 49:01.939
before you make
any commitments.

49:03.679 --> 49:04.985
And...

49:07.422 --> 49:08.467
we never got that.

49:09.859 --> 49:11.426
[Teicher] It was plain

49:11.557 --> 49:14.603
that we had been misled
by Ghorbanifar.

49:14.734 --> 49:16.736
He had misled both parties

49:16.866 --> 49:20.435
in an effort
to create a situation

49:20.566 --> 49:22.437
where a deal would happen.

49:22.568 --> 49:27.747
And once we knew
that Ghorbanifar had lied to us

49:27.877 --> 49:29.618
and lied to the Iranians,

49:29.749 --> 49:31.925
I knew
this was a really bad idea.

49:32.056 --> 49:33.840
[McFarlane]
I aborted the mission

49:33.971 --> 49:35.798
before it was 48 hours old

49:35.929 --> 49:37.583
when there was
a breach of commitment

49:37.713 --> 49:40.238
that they had made
to deliver hostages.

49:41.456 --> 49:43.719
[Neyfakh] On the morning
of their third day in Tehran,

49:43.850 --> 49:46.592
things went from bad to worse.

49:46.722 --> 49:49.551
News that Americans were
in town on a secret mission

49:49.682 --> 49:51.292
had leaked to the public.

49:51.423 --> 49:53.207
[Cave] A couple of mullahs
found out about it,

49:53.338 --> 49:54.730
started spreading the word,

49:54.861 --> 49:57.124
and that's when
the mobs were formed.

49:57.646 --> 49:58.908
[Neyfakh] A failed mission

49:59.039 --> 50:01.259
suddenly became
a life-threatening one.

50:01.389 --> 50:03.696
They said,
"Get everyone down here.

50:03.826 --> 50:05.480
"We gotta get you out of here,

50:05.611 --> 50:08.179
"because this mob's coming up
the main highway.

50:08.309 --> 50:10.659
It's blocked."

50:10.790 --> 50:15.795
So we went over the backroads
of Northern Tehran,

50:15.925 --> 50:17.362
to get out of the way
of these guys

50:17.492 --> 50:18.711
that were coming to get us.

50:21.801 --> 50:23.672
And we just got on the plane
and left.

50:27.024 --> 50:28.634
I think we were all
kind of glad to get out alive.

50:28.764 --> 50:30.070
[laughs]

50:35.119 --> 50:38.165
The plane ride home
was very quiet.

50:39.732 --> 50:40.776
It was very quiet.

50:43.649 --> 50:46.478
I recall saying to Bud that,
while we failed,

50:46.608 --> 50:48.175
you know, we did
the right thing to try.

50:50.525 --> 50:52.571
And he said, "Maybe."

50:59.578 --> 51:00.796
[Neyfakh]
The American delegation

51:00.927 --> 51:03.408
had escaped with their lives,

51:03.538 --> 51:06.846
but the fate of the hostages
still hung in the balance.

51:06.976 --> 51:09.501
And just six months later,

51:09.631 --> 51:11.677
details
of the Iran-Contra operation

51:11.807 --> 51:14.549
would leak out into the open.

51:14.680 --> 51:16.203
The consequences
for the Reagan Administration

51:16.334 --> 51:17.074
would be monumental.
