There's some things I need
to talk to you about.

05:43.575 --> 05:46.576

So you know?

06:01.926 --> 06:03.496
Know what?

06:05.563 --> 06:06.662
That she's gone.

06:06.664 --> 06:08.532
She passed.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.470
Not in the way they say
she did.

06:12.671 --> 06:14.737
I didn't think the truth was
something you could handle.

06:14.739 --> 06:15.905
What truth is that?

06:15.907 --> 06:17.710
That our mother
killed herself.

06:21.679 --> 06:22.746
She left you.

skipped over your grief.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.825

You need to call that guy.

06:45.837 --> 06:46.906
Why?

06:48.573 --> 06:50.109

06:51.842 --> 06:53.610
Mom didn't have any money.

06:53.612 --> 06:55.578
There was an
insurance policy.

06:55.580 --> 06:56.780
Mom didn't have any insurance.

06:56.782 --> 06:59.114
Apparently she did.

07:00.619 --> 07:02.718
Why didn't she tell anyone?

07:02.720 --> 07:04.687

07:22.674 --> 07:24.943
How much money I made
off my mother's death? Nah.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.944
Look. She did this for us.

07:28.946 --> 07:29.812
To look out for us.

07:29.814 --> 07:31.213
To give us an opportunity.

07:31.215 --> 07:32.148
I took it.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.682
I did what she wanted.

07:33.684 --> 07:35.554

I gotta go check out
the farm.

08:56.701 --> 08:59.135
I think someone might
be squatting there.

08:59.137 --> 09:00.102
You haven't been there
in years.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.108
Why would someone be
at your mother's farm?

09:04.209 --> 09:05.777
'Cause it's his mother, too.

09:12.817 --> 09:15.785
Dean, you said "some guy".

09:15.787 --> 09:16.852
You called your brother
"some guy".

09:16.854 --> 09:19.723
He is some guy.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.757

on your brother

09:21.759 --> 09:24.761
is not gonna cut it this time.

to start.

Nothing ever changes.

11:26.183 --> 11:28.117
Not in this town.

11:28.119 --> 11:31.087

You know, I didn't wanna
say anything

11:32.123 --> 11:33.323

about him,

any agitations...

Your big brother's become
a big deal in this little town.

So what do you do?

15:00.065 --> 15:01.467
Why?

15:03.067 --> 15:05.203
Because it's a good way
to get to know someone?

for him, don't you?

20:08.406 --> 20:10.973
I wasn't sure how deep
it went.

20:10.975 --> 20:13.541
You really do hate him.

20:13.543 --> 20:15.877
Facts is facts, Jack.

20:15.879 --> 20:17.780
There ain't no facts
in your head, boy.

20:17.782 --> 20:19.447
I ain't your boy.

20:19.449 --> 20:21.483
Thank god.

20:21.485 --> 20:22.484
You like facts?

20:22.486 --> 20:24.653
Your mother didn't have
an enemy in this world.

20:24.655 --> 20:27.389
No sign of forced entry,
doors locked

20:27.391 --> 20:28.723
from the inside,
no prints.

20:28.725 --> 20:30.725
The scene didn't reveal
anything that said

20:30.727 --> 20:32.461
she didn't kill herself.

20:32.463 --> 20:36.531
No foul play, no weapons,
no nothing.

20:36.533 --> 20:37.567
No note.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.934
So? It wouldn't be the first
suicide in history

20:38.936 --> 20:39.934
without a note...

20:39.936 --> 20:40.501
Listen, our mother wouldn't go
to the bathroom

20:40.503 --> 20:42.907
without leaving a note.

20:44.942 --> 20:46.008
This is a waste of my time.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.543
Yeah, why don't you go back
to your movie, Jack?

20:48.545 --> 20:50.913
Look, asshole.

20:50.915 --> 20:54.683
You got something from
reality you wanna share with me?

20:54.685 --> 20:56.620
Otherwise, fuck off.

21:05.163 --> 21:05.961
Congratulations.

21:05.963 --> 21:07.029
A business license.

21:07.031 --> 21:08.830
Two weeks before she died.

21:08.832 --> 21:09.799
She's starting a business.

21:09.801 --> 21:10.933
Does that look like the actions
of somebody

21:10.935 --> 21:12.704
who's checking out?

21:15.439 --> 21:17.839
Look, son, you're reaching.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.841
I know it's tough.

21:19.843 --> 21:23.979
I know it's hit you hard,
harder than anyone.

21:23.981 --> 21:27.715
Why can't you just accept
the truth?

21:27.717 --> 21:29.851
Your mother was tired.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.655
She wanted out.

21:34.992 --> 21:36.861
'Cause I knew her.

21:58.483 --> 22:04.556
(GRUNTS)

22:22.005 --> 22:29.979
<i>We are a species with almost
dumbfounding kindness.</i>

22:29.981 --> 22:34.782
We romance each other,
we nurse one another,

22:34.784 --> 22:40.055
weep for each other, and ever
since science taught us how,

22:40.057 --> 22:45.728
we willingly tear the very
organs from our bodies

22:45.730 --> 22:48.763
and give them to each other.

22:48.765 --> 22:54.869
And at the same time
we slaughter each other.

22:54.871 --> 23:02.578
The savage and the sweet
can exist in any one animal.

23:02.580 --> 23:06.147
They can exist
in any one person,

23:06.149 --> 23:10.051
and often in one instant.

23:10.053 --> 23:14.088
A good man can do
a bad thing

23:14.090 --> 23:17.529
and a bad man can do
a good thing.

23:20.031 --> 23:22.100
So what does that make them?

23:25.969 --> 23:28.672
What makes a man good?

23:55.866 --> 23:58.637
<i>Nice costume, Leonard.</i>

24:01.772 --> 24:04.842
Why didn't anybody tell me
about the money?

24:10.947 --> 24:13.618
That's all you have to say?

24:15.719 --> 24:17.853
After all the time
you've been gone?

24:17.855 --> 24:21.022
I didn't come here
to shoot the breeze.

24:21.024 --> 24:24.193
I didn't tell you 'cause
I didn't know.

24:24.195 --> 24:26.998
I found out a few days
after the funeral,

24:29.867 --> 24:32.070
when you would have found out.

24:32.969 --> 24:34.738
If you were around.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.673
Where you been?

24:37.675 --> 24:39.107
You don't think
that's strange?

24:39.109 --> 24:41.743
She wouldn't tell you,
not her kids, not a soul?

24:41.745 --> 24:43.811
Your mother didn't tell me
much in the end.

24:43.813 --> 24:45.215
Why would she?

24:47.651 --> 24:48.783
Come inside for a spell.

24:48.785 --> 24:49.784
Might do you some good.

24:49.786 --> 24:51.086
I've got tons to sort out.

24:51.088 --> 24:53.955
I don't think praying's
gonna help.

24:53.957 --> 24:56.791
I was thinking more along
the lines of confession.

24:56.793 --> 24:58.827
I'll pass.

24:58.829 --> 25:00.663
You don't believe in
God now?

25:00.665 --> 25:02.196
That's a whole new
kind of alone.

25:02.198 --> 25:04.799
I don't got no beef
with God.

25:04.801 --> 25:08.136
I don't go out of my way
to please him, either.

25:08.138 --> 25:10.007
Sounds like us.

25:11.908 --> 25:13.811
Not really.

25:21.185 --> 25:23.088
How did we end up like this?

25:23.954 --> 25:25.820
Like what?

25:25.822 --> 25:27.725
Strangers.

25:31.061 --> 25:32.830
I don't know.

25:33.697 --> 25:36.098
I figured when I was born
you decided I was the bad one

25:36.100 --> 25:37.133
and you never let it go.

25:37.135 --> 25:40.672
You didn't do much to change
my mind about it.

25:42.706 --> 25:45.139
You forget, Leonard.

25:45.141 --> 25:47.946
I knew you before you were
touched by God.

25:53.751 --> 25:56.253
They say time heals
all wounds,

25:59.724 --> 26:02.660
that it's never too late
to turn it all around.

26:11.334 --> 26:13.737
(CLOSES DOOR)

26:58.248 --> 26:59.781
Yes.

26:59.783 --> 27:01.983
Yes, yes, yes.

27:01.985 --> 27:04.054
Here it is.

27:08.292 --> 27:09.957
Ah.

27:09.959 --> 27:11.827
Now, if the client,
uh, commits suicide

27:11.829 --> 27:14.363
within the first two years a
beneficiary will not receive

27:14.365 --> 27:17.031
the face value
of the coverage.

27:17.033 --> 27:20.802
So you're very lucky that
the two years had lapsed

27:20.804 --> 27:23.238
before your mother,
uh... passed.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.873
In the fashion that she did.

27:24.875 --> 27:26.241
Lucky?

27:26.243 --> 27:27.242
Apologies.

27:27.244 --> 27:29.912
I just meant you'll be receiving
a full payment.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.815
You see, it was just over
two years before she um, um...

27:32.817 --> 27:33.348
before she...

27:33.350 --> 27:35.320
Killed herself?

27:37.154 --> 27:38.419
Yes.

27:38.421 --> 27:39.855
You don't think
that's a little odd?

27:39.857 --> 27:43.424
Well, yes and no.

27:43.426 --> 27:45.828
Who else did she leave
money for?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.095
I'm afraid that's confidential.

27:47.097 --> 27:49.164
Confidential?

27:49.166 --> 27:52.201
Was she my mother
or your mother?

27:52.203 --> 27:54.970
It was at her request that
the other beneficiaries

27:54.972 --> 27:56.238
remain private.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.308
You mean beneficiary,
not beneficiaries.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.111
I can't discuss it.

28:03.379 --> 28:06.147
How expensive
is this insurance?

28:06.149 --> 28:08.116
Oh, are you looking to put
something in place for you

28:08.118 --> 28:09.417
and your loved ones?

28:09.419 --> 28:11.086
I don't have any loved ones.

28:11.088 --> 28:14.188
I'm just wondering how
she can afford it, Barnie,

28:14.190 --> 28:16.124
because my mother
didn't have any money.

28:16.126 --> 28:17.992
Especially not
throw-away money.

28:17.994 --> 28:20.229
I wouldn't call it
"throw-away money", it's...

28:20.231 --> 28:22.330
How'd she pay for it then?

28:22.332 --> 28:24.165
We're generally not
concerned with how people

28:24.167 --> 28:26.300
pay their premiums,
just that they're paid.

28:26.302 --> 28:29.006
Yeah, that's about
the answer I expected.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.007
I'm sorry, sir.

28:32.009 --> 28:34.878
Have I done something
to offend you?

28:37.046 --> 28:39.283
Your existence offends me.

28:43.486 --> 28:45.290
I'm sorry.

28:50.060 --> 28:52.230
Death is a messy business.

29:07.343 --> 29:09.147
Saxon?

29:10.313 --> 29:12.182
It's your mother.

29:18.155 --> 29:19.924
Use the money.

29:21.457 --> 29:23.927
People will help.

29:25.061 --> 29:27.331
People will do anything
for money.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.936
Use it to do some good.

29:38.975 --> 29:40.041
Hey.

29:40.043 --> 29:41.510
Hey.

29:41.512 --> 29:43.047
Wake up.

29:46.183 --> 29:48.549
What the fuck are
you doing here?

29:48.551 --> 29:51.552
You really are fucking insane,
you know that?

29:51.554 --> 29:53.490
You called me.

29:57.226 --> 29:58.428
So?

30:01.497 --> 30:03.098
I need to meet
with your old man.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.035
Can you swing it?

30:07.972 --> 30:09.407
My old man?

30:10.440 --> 30:13.474
You must be fixed on
starting some trouble.

30:13.476 --> 30:15.409
What kind of trouble?

30:15.411 --> 30:17.381
Permanent kind.

30:39.369 --> 30:40.972
Let us talk..

30:45.009 --> 30:47.445
That means go be a fuck up
way over there.

30:54.318 --> 30:56.518
Why are you always
so rough on him?

30:56.520 --> 30:57.319
Oh, I don't know.

30:57.321 --> 31:00.021
You only hurt the ones
you love.

31:00.023 --> 31:02.290
That's what he's there for.

31:02.292 --> 31:04.492
Yeah, my dad had
the same philosophy.

31:04.494 --> 31:05.292
Yeah?

31:05.294 --> 31:06.360
Yeah.

31:06.362 --> 31:09.030
How is the old fucker?

31:09.032 --> 31:09.965
I don't know.

31:09.967 --> 31:11.032
You're the one who's friendly
with him.

31:11.034 --> 31:15.105
I was, until he started
identifying as a preacher.

31:17.073 --> 31:19.273
Oh, I know that look.

31:19.275 --> 31:22.277
I've seen it a hundred times.

31:22.279 --> 31:25.079
And there's no good
gonna come of it.

31:25.081 --> 31:27.648
Yeah, well I think my mom
was buried with some secrets.

31:27.650 --> 31:30.318
You know, I think everybody's
buried with some secrets.

31:30.320 --> 31:34.056
Yeah, I need these ones
dug up.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.590
You never struck me as
the kind of guy

31:36.592 --> 31:39.594
who needs help with
that kind of thing.

31:39.596 --> 31:43.401
I need someone a little
more... subtle.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.204
(CHUCKLES)

31:48.371 --> 31:50.539
I've never been called
that before.

31:50.541 --> 31:53.508
Everyone in this town either
likes you or they fear you.

31:53.510 --> 31:54.608
Yeah.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.211
What about you?

31:56.213 --> 31:57.581
I've never liked you.

32:01.618 --> 32:03.354
Well, good.

32:04.353 --> 32:06.256
You got balls and brains.

32:07.623 --> 32:09.259
Not many of us left.

32:14.430 --> 32:16.100
Alright.

32:18.099 --> 32:18.366
I'll put junior on it.

32:18.368 --> 32:20.501
I came to you.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.474
Well, I gotta know if it's me
asking the questions.

32:28.512 --> 32:31.279
Hmm.

32:31.281 --> 32:33.548
Now you must want
something done.

32:33.550 --> 32:35.183
Just some information.

32:35.185 --> 32:35.817
Mmmhmm.

32:35.819 --> 32:38.056
I'll do the doing myself.

32:41.425 --> 32:43.194
Hmm.

32:48.665 --> 32:51.732
âª I don't care if
it rains or freezes, âª

33:14.625 --> 33:16.394
<i>Saxon's come home.</i>

33:19.329 --> 33:22.297
It reminds me of it all.

33:22.299 --> 33:24.566
Who I was.

33:24.568 --> 33:27.569
Things I've done.

33:27.571 --> 33:31.572
All of it.

33:31.574 --> 33:34.475
Why is it such a
goddamn struggle?

33:34.477 --> 33:39.614
This... regret.

33:39.616 --> 33:41.515
Can't run from it.

33:41.517 --> 33:44.586
Can't escape it.

33:44.588 --> 33:47.157
It becomes you.

33:50.226 --> 33:56.298
When I came to you I was
a drunk man of violence.

33:56.300 --> 34:00.301
My life had no meaning.

34:00.303 --> 34:03.338
Look how far I've come.

34:03.340 --> 34:09.643
All these people coming here
hear me speak.

34:09.645 --> 34:12.181
I've come far, right?

34:14.618 --> 34:16.520
Right?

(VEHICLE PULLS UP)

34:33.369 --> 34:34.638
(HONKS HORN)

34:52.489 --> 34:54.489
So let me get this straight.

34:54.491 --> 34:56.858
You're using your mother's
life insurance money

34:56.860 --> 35:00.661
to investigate your mother's
suicide, is that right?

35:00.663 --> 35:02.396
Yeah.

35:02.398 --> 35:03.264
That's fucked up.

35:03.266 --> 35:05.203
You know that, right?

35:06.402 --> 35:08.802
Life insurance is
a creepy thing.

35:08.804 --> 35:11.873
It sets up an undesirable
situation.

35:11.875 --> 35:14.275
It's like having a bounty
on your head

35:14.277 --> 35:15.409
except the wanted
poster doesn't say

35:15.411 --> 35:16.378
"wanted dead or alive",

35:16.380 --> 35:19.380
it says "wanted dead
and only fucking dead".

You know him?

35:27.491 --> 35:28.023
No.

35:28.025 --> 35:29.590
Never heard of him?

35:29.592 --> 35:30.759
No.

35:30.761 --> 35:32.697
Well, then I got something
for ya.

35:48.511 --> 35:50.313
Where'd you get this?

35:51.614 --> 35:55.550
I got a little buddy wanting
who's more persuasive than I am.

used to work.

01:13:28.169 --> 01:13:30.569

Clayton Bowman's a ghost.

01:13:33.074 --> 01:13:35.677

it's not in this town.

01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:47.653

something else.

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:05.037
So you're the one asking
about Clayton Bowman?

01:14:05.039 --> 01:14:06.005
Yeah.

01:14:06.007 --> 01:14:06.838
He's a friend.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.742
Last I heard he was
working here.

01:14:09.744 --> 01:14:11.610
How can I help?

01:14:11.612 --> 01:14:14.079
Well, I was wondering
where I could find him.

01:14:14.081 --> 01:14:15.180
Find him?

01:14:15.182 --> 01:14:16.181
Yeah.

01:14:16.183 --> 01:14:20.885
A forwarding address,
phone number, anything.

01:14:20.887 --> 01:14:22.822
Uh, I'm sorry to say

01:14:22.824 --> 01:14:26.891
the only place you're gonna find
him is in Pinewood Cemetery.

01:14:26.893 --> 01:14:28.896
Clayton died.

01:14:31.766 --> 01:14:32.898
How'd he die?

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.065
Car accident.

01:14:34.067 --> 01:14:36.668
He drove his car off a cliff.

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:37.836
Landed in a river.

01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:39.771
I guess they figured
he was drunk.

01:14:39.773 --> 01:14:40.973
They figured?

01:14:40.975 --> 01:14:43.042
Wasn't there an autopsy that
could tell if he was drunk?

01:14:43.044 --> 01:14:43.943
There was no autopsy.

01:14:43.945 --> 01:14:45.911
They never found the body.

01:14:45.913 --> 01:14:47.212
How did they know
he was dead?

01:14:47.214 --> 01:14:48.980
His convertible went off
a cliff.

01:14:48.982 --> 01:14:50.750
It was a wild river.

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:53.719
I guess they figured
he floated out,

01:14:53.721 --> 01:14:56.921
drifted downstream somewhere.

01:14:56.923 --> 01:14:59.225
That's a lot of figuring,
not a lot of facts.

01:14:59.227 --> 01:15:00.960
Well, what can I say?

01:15:00.962 --> 01:15:03.929
It was pretty obvious
to everyone what happened.

01:15:03.931 --> 01:15:05.864
There was no shortage of
people looking into it.

01:15:05.866 --> 01:15:08.900
I'm sure the police would
have taken a special interest.

01:15:08.902 --> 01:15:11.072
A special interest?

01:15:13.007 --> 01:15:15.009
Clayton was one of theirs.

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:17.946
He used to be a cop.

01:15:19.847 --> 01:15:21.747
He didn't happen to die a
couple of years ago,

01:15:21.749 --> 01:15:24.283

01:15:24.285 --> 01:15:26.851
I'd say exactly around then.

01:15:26.853 --> 01:15:28.086
How could you know that?

01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:30.024
Like I said, he was a friend.

01:15:31.025 --> 01:15:32.060
Hmm.

01:15:34.695 --> 01:15:37.796
Well, I don't know what else
I can tell you, friend.

01:15:37.798 --> 01:15:40.099
Did he have any family?

01:15:41.835 --> 01:15:45.973

know whether he had family.

01:34:50.883 --> 01:34:53.087
I cry all the time.

Don't you wanna know
why I'm crying?

01:35:02.395 --> 01:35:05.162
I already know.

I can't say anything
to stop you, can I?

01:35:25.185 --> 01:35:28.022
Don't do anything stupid.

I know I'm responsible
for how you turned out

01:36:26.478 --> 01:36:28.947
but I can't take all the credit.

01:36:38.191 --> 01:36:41.225
You hate me.

01:36:41.227 --> 01:36:43.528
My mother loved me,
but she died.

Why would you leave
your name on something

the name Clayton Bowman?</i>

No, why would she?

01:45:00.759 --> 01:45:02.896
What's she got to do with this?

01:45:08.868 --> 01:45:12.735
Can you think of any reason why
Clayton Bowman would be listed

01:45:12.737 --> 01:45:19.877

wife's life insurance policy?

No, I can't.

right about his mother?

01:45:32.991 --> 01:45:34.757
She didn't kill herself?

any conclusions yet.

yet, but you're right.

on to something.
