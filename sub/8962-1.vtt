03:19.127 --> 03:20.924
Come on, sir, give us a penny!

03:23.207 --> 03:24.037
Run!

03:25.167 --> 03:26.600
Sorry.

03:35.767 --> 03:38.645
Lucky heather, sir? Come on, sir.

03:38.687 --> 03:40.598
Looking for someone?

03:40.647 --> 03:43.605
Er... Yes, actually, I...

03:43.647 --> 03:46.480
Mr Gray. Welcome to London, sir.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.678
Go on, lady. Off you go!

04:23.607 --> 04:24.960
Whoa.

04:27.087 --> 04:29.647
And here we are, sir. Welcome home.

04:37.607 --> 04:40.246
I hope you'll find everything
to your liking, sir.

04:40.287 --> 04:42.243
Nothing's changed since I was a boy.

04:42.287 --> 04:43.800
Sir.

04:58.687 --> 05:00.518
I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.364
May I prepare some tea?

05:02.407 --> 05:04.318
Thank you, Victor.

06:15.047 --> 06:18.926
I've no doubt London will hold many
new friends and adventures for you.

06:18.967 --> 06:21.117
- I hope so.
- So do I.

06:21.167 --> 06:24.364
Oh! This is somebody
you simply must meet.

06:24.407 --> 06:26.762
This is one of our finest artists,
Basil Hallward.

06:26.807 --> 06:29.401
Agatha, please,
a humble student of beauty.

06:32.327 --> 06:33.726
- What do you think?
- Oh.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.683
That's quite a likeness.

07:09.407 --> 07:11.762
- Basil.
- Hmm?

07:11.807 --> 07:13.479
I've been in London two weeks now.

07:13.527 --> 07:16.041
The only people I've met
are Agatha's charitable group.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.918
Well, you've met me.

07:17.967 --> 07:19.605
Of course.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.120
I didn't mean...

07:22.167 --> 07:24.727
These parties are terribly dull, Dorian.

07:24.767 --> 07:27.804
- You won't be missing anything.
- I'm sure you're right.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.075
I just...

07:30.487 --> 07:32.398
...thought it might be fun.

07:50.007 --> 07:51.679
Oh...

07:51.727 --> 07:53.683
Dear me, no.

07:53.727 --> 07:55.160
Shabby.

07:56.167 --> 07:57.998
Wife, drink.

08:02.687 --> 08:04.962
There. I'll fetch us some drinks.

08:05.007 --> 08:08.920
Find her a good husband
who knows how to behave to a woman.

08:08.967 --> 08:11.561
The only way to behave is
to make love to her if she's pretty

08:11.607 --> 08:13.882
and to someone else if she's plain.
Excuse me.

08:17.727 --> 08:19.046
Cigarette?

08:20.127 --> 08:22.004
No, thank you.

08:22.847 --> 08:24.997
I find a cigarette to be the perfect pleasure.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.083
It is exquisite

08:27.127 --> 08:29.038
and leaves one unsatisfied.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.518
You're Kelso's grandson.

08:42.567 --> 08:43.760
Yes.

08:44.967 --> 08:46.878
- Did you know him?
- I met him once.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.963
It was enough
to give a cheer last month

08:49.007 --> 08:50.918
when he rasped his last sour breath.

08:52.247 --> 08:55.523
One assumes you inherited
the withered old goat's estate?

08:56.767 --> 08:58.723
Being a little orphan isn't all bad.

08:59.967 --> 09:03.403
"An earnest young man with a beautiful
nature," according to Agatha.

09:03.447 --> 09:07.520
I'd pictured some freckled country oaf
in ghastly dress.

09:09.727 --> 09:11.718
I see I was only half right.

09:13.607 --> 09:15.359
It could be worse.

09:15.407 --> 09:18.922
Gladys Allonby's been dressed for her
14th birthday ever since her 40th.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.685
If Radley spent less time in church
and more at his tailor's,

09:22.727 --> 09:25.002
he might not so resemble
a badly-bound hymn book.

09:26.047 --> 09:28.436
Are you sure you won't take a cigarette?

09:28.487 --> 09:30.955
I get them directly from Cairo.

09:31.007 --> 09:33.919
I see you've met our charming host.

09:35.447 --> 09:36.721
Hm?

09:36.767 --> 09:38.723
Pay no attention to anything he tells you.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.723
How rude. Henry Wotton.

09:40.767 --> 09:42.166
Victoria, my wife.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.038
My aunt, alas, you know.

09:45.087 --> 09:48.523
Oh, I'm so glad you've met.
You might learn some manners from this boy.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.558
I've found some more guests for you to insult.

09:50.607 --> 09:52.723
I knew I kept her for something.

09:53.647 --> 09:56.639
I do hope our paths cross again, Mr Gray.

09:58.087 --> 10:01.045
Thank you for the cigarette...
... cigarette.

10:01.087 --> 10:02.998
An acquired taste.

10:03.047 --> 10:05.880
- No, it's actually quite pleasant.
- No, I meant Henry.

10:08.527 --> 10:10.961
There's some people I want you to meet.

11:31.367 --> 11:33.323
Dorian...

12:28.647 --> 12:31.161
<i>Aren't you tired of looking at me yet?</i>

12:31.207 --> 12:33.084
Certainly not.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.765
The more I look...

12:36.447 --> 12:38.517
...the more I see.

13:00.767 --> 13:04.362
It must be nearly finished, man.
It isn't the Sistine Chapel.

13:04.407 --> 13:07.319
Do you remember when I told you
you could sit in if you were quiet?

13:07.367 --> 13:09.881
- I want to see it.
- No, no, don't.

13:09.927 --> 13:12.441
He won't even let me have a peek.

13:17.727 --> 13:20.878
Agatha tells me your father was also an artist.

13:20.927 --> 13:23.441
- Apparently so.
- Kelso must have been delighted,

13:23.487 --> 13:26.206
his daughter falling
for some penniless painter.

13:28.327 --> 13:30.318
No wonder they eloped.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.676
- I never knew my parents.
- Of course.

13:32.727 --> 13:34.638
Typhus is so awful.

13:34.687 --> 13:37.565
Your poor mother carried off in childbirth.

13:39.647 --> 13:42.241
Do you take such interest
in everyone you meet?

13:42.287 --> 13:44.278
Not everyone I meet is so interesting.

13:44.327 --> 13:47.239
Henry, why don't you go for a stroll,

13:47.287 --> 13:49.596
while I just work up the background?

13:49.647 --> 13:51.524
You don't need Dorian for that.

13:52.247 --> 13:53.805
Let's both take a break.

13:53.847 --> 13:57.965
- Perhaps we should all get some air.
- Yes, and I know just the place.

14:11.047 --> 14:15.484
Look. It's rancid! It's rancid!
It's only five days old. I'm not paying.

14:19.687 --> 14:21.564
Come on, Dorian.

14:22.527 --> 14:23.562
Sorry.

14:23.607 --> 14:25.837
You see why Agatha is so keen
to help Whitechapel?

14:25.887 --> 14:28.526
Don't you think we should at least try
to make a difference?

14:28.567 --> 14:32.719
I've no desire to change anything
in England, except the weather.

14:39.047 --> 14:41.481
Welcome to my little Hellfire Club.

14:46.447 --> 14:49.723
- Here you are, gents.
- In one.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.166
No, don't, don't.

14:53.447 --> 14:55.438
- Barkeeper.

14:55.487 --> 14:57.239
Again.

14:58.247 --> 15:01.683
How say you and the handsome
young man stuff me double?

15:01.727 --> 15:04.878
Er, no, thank you.
We nonetheless wish you godspeed

15:04.927 --> 15:06.963
on your evening's quest for romance.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.084
A little wider, my dear.

15:11.447 --> 15:13.244
Oh!

15:14.687 --> 15:17.759
Don't worry. He's a doctor.

15:19.847 --> 15:21.599
There's no shame in pleasure, Mr Gray.

15:21.647 --> 15:23.205
Man just wants to be happy.

15:23.247 --> 15:27.206
But society wants him to be good.
And when he's good, Man is rarely happy.

15:27.247 --> 15:29.477
But when he's happy, he's always good.

15:31.007 --> 15:34.079
You do want to be good,
don't you, Mr Gray, and happy?

15:34.127 --> 15:37.244
Isn't there a price to pay
for that sort of business?

15:37.287 --> 15:39.243
She's quite affordable.

15:39.927 --> 15:43.044
But what I was asking
was about the effect on...

15:43.087 --> 15:44.679
Buy a lady a drink?

15:44.727 --> 15:47.605
- On what?
- Well, on one's soul.

15:49.127 --> 15:50.879
One's soul?

15:51.767 --> 15:53.439
This is my church.

15:54.927 --> 15:58.840
With this dram, right now,
I nail my soul to the Devil's altar.

15:58.887 --> 16:03.403
You'll never meet a more eloquent
philosopher of pure folly.

16:05.327 --> 16:08.637
Come on, Dorian.
It's time we showed you what we've made.

16:08.687 --> 16:11.884
- Really?
- The boy hasn't finished his gin.

16:11.927 --> 16:15.317
Go and fiddle with your background.
We'll be along shortly.

16:17.247 --> 16:19.078
Your picture awaits you, Dorian.

16:28.847 --> 16:31.441
Perhaps you should go and speak to her.

16:32.927 --> 16:34.519
I didn't realise she...

16:34.567 --> 16:36.558
Don't be timid. Go.

16:38.527 --> 16:41.200
- I wouldn't know where to...
- You see, I envy you.

16:41.247 --> 16:42.646
Me?

16:42.687 --> 16:44.086
Everything's possible for you

16:44.127 --> 16:46.561
because you have
the only two things worth having.

16:46.607 --> 16:48.006
Youth...

16:48.087 --> 16:49.805
and beauty.

16:52.487 --> 16:54.000
Come on, let's go.

16:54.087 --> 16:55.998
The moment's lost.

17:00.047 --> 17:02.003
That was probably her husband.

17:02.047 --> 17:03.958
Yes, very sensible.

17:05.087 --> 17:07.646
People die of common sense, Dorian,

17:07.686 --> 17:10.406
one lost moment at a time.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.438
Life is a moment.
There is no hereafter.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.161
So make it burn always

17:17.207 --> 17:19.163
with the hardest flame.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.558
Well, Basil...

17:31.687 --> 17:33.882
...it's quite the best thing you've done.

17:35.887 --> 17:37.639
You'll be the talk of the town.

17:38.847 --> 17:40.838
Both of you.

17:43.527 --> 17:45.722
Speak up, boy. You'll hurt his feelings.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.678
Is that really how I look?

17:50.727 --> 17:52.718
It's just so...

17:53.687 --> 17:55.040
...life-like.

17:55.087 --> 17:57.123
Better than life.

18:00.207 --> 18:02.118
He'll always look like that.

18:03.847 --> 18:06.884
You, Mr Gray, I'm afraid will not.

18:08.887 --> 18:12.641
In time, Mother Nature will come
a very poor second to Father Basil.

18:12.687 --> 18:16.043
- Some things are precious for not lasting.
- Poppycock.

18:16.087 --> 18:19.523
We wither and scar
because the gods are cruel and hateful.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.079
Perhaps I should nail my soul
to the Devil's altar.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.598
And remain as you are? Fair trade.

18:27.647 --> 18:29.717
How about another gin instead?

18:30.567 --> 18:33.206
All that hocus-pocus, endless conjurations,

18:33.247 --> 18:35.442
books bound in infant skin,

18:35.487 --> 18:38.559
pentacles of fire,
drinking the blood of virgins.

18:38.607 --> 18:42.122
Dorian wouldn't really barter his soul.

18:44.367 --> 18:45.959
Would you, Dorian?

18:48.607 --> 18:50.086
Would you?

18:51.767 --> 18:53.439
Yes.

19:03.887 --> 19:08.199
Oh, you really have captured
something quite exquisite, Basil.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.477
I've never known a subject so unaffected.

19:10.527 --> 19:14.759
The brush just seemed to dance
and I just painted what I saw.

19:14.807 --> 19:16.718
Kelso will turn in his grave.

19:18.887 --> 19:21.117
He didn't care to look at me.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.486
He blamed me for my mother,

19:22.527 --> 19:24.518
for her death.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.956
There are no limits
to the ugliness of old men.

19:27.527 --> 19:29.802
Lips! And his eyes!

19:29.847 --> 19:32.236
Almost a match for the original.

19:32.287 --> 19:35.324
- You must get used to being looked at.
- Well, it's a fine painting.

19:35.367 --> 19:38.757
- I don't mean the painting.
- Mr Gray, if you please.

19:42.567 --> 19:45.604
- That went rather well, didn't it?
- A triumph, Mr Gray.

19:46.287 --> 19:47.845
The first of many.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.321
May I say, sir,

19:55.367 --> 19:57.642
your mother would be very proud
to see you today.

20:01.847 --> 20:03.644
Shall I draw your bath?

20:03.687 --> 20:05.484
It's rather early.

20:07.967 --> 20:09.878
Do we have any gin?

20:09.927 --> 20:11.838
I believe not, sir.

20:13.607 --> 20:16.519
Then perhaps you might
summon me a hansom?

20:24.327 --> 20:26.363
- Go on, poke him!
- I am poking him!

20:26.407 --> 20:28.318
Check his pockets!

20:29.207 --> 20:30.845
Oi!

20:30.887 --> 20:32.605
Yes?

20:32.647 --> 20:34.842
- Wet your pizzle, sir?
- Hello, handsome.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.278
Boy!

20:49.487 --> 20:51.796
Have a box, my lord? Just a bob.

20:51.847 --> 20:53.758
You've only missed a little.

20:58.647 --> 21:00.524
This young lady...

21:00.567 --> 21:03.684
Miss Sibyl Vane, my lord,
in the role of Ophelia.

21:03.727 --> 21:06.036
...see that noble
and most sovereign reason

21:06.087 --> 21:10.205
like sweet bells jangled,
out of tune and harsh.

21:10.247 --> 21:13.796
That unmatch'd form
and feature of blown youth

21:13.847 --> 21:15.644
blasted with ecstasy.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.678
Oh, woe is me.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.437
May I present

21:25.527 --> 21:29.281
the Theatre Royale's
Miss Sibyl Vane, my lord?

21:37.447 --> 21:39.358
I'm not really a lord.

21:39.407 --> 21:41.557
I don't know why he keeps saying that.

21:41.607 --> 21:43.962
We don't get many gentlemen
in this theatre.

21:44.007 --> 21:45.759
Really?

21:45.807 --> 21:48.002
Well, then, I shall recommend it...

21:49.087 --> 21:50.679
...to them.

21:57.207 --> 21:59.357
May I ask what brings you
to my dressing room?

21:59.407 --> 22:00.726
Well, I...

22:00.767 --> 22:03.201
I just happened
to be passing the theatre and...

22:05.367 --> 22:08.086
- Well, you see, I was in the gin shop...
- I know.

22:09.167 --> 22:11.317
You remember?

22:11.367 --> 22:14.564
Well, a friend took me there
for the first time.

22:14.607 --> 22:17.679
Well, I say the first time.
Of course, I have...

22:20.047 --> 22:22.720
Well, I wanted to... wanted to say hello,

22:22.767 --> 22:25.122
but then you left with...

22:25.167 --> 22:27.078
- With Jim.
- Yes.

22:27.887 --> 22:29.366
Quite.

22:30.607 --> 22:32.245
Jim.

22:33.287 --> 22:35.278
My brother.

22:36.247 --> 22:38.078
Brother?

22:38.127 --> 22:40.846
- Mm.
- Well, that's splendid!

22:45.367 --> 22:47.403
Sorry. It was wrong of me to...

22:47.447 --> 22:50.564
Please forgive my intrusion,
Miss Vane.

22:50.607 --> 22:54.156
Wait! There's something
you haven't told me.

22:58.887 --> 23:00.798
Yes, of course.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.758
I do beg your pardon.

23:06.287 --> 23:08.084
Ophelia is a most challenging role

23:08.127 --> 23:12.166
and your performance this evening
was... impeccable.

23:12.207 --> 23:14.084
In fact, extraordinary.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.401
In fact...

23:16.607 --> 23:18.518
...you are extraordinary.

23:20.087 --> 23:22.237
And when I saw you on the stage,

23:22.287 --> 23:26.963
and even more so,
now I stand before you,

23:27.007 --> 23:31.319
I am awestruck and humbled
by your radiance.

23:34.007 --> 23:35.998
I meant your name.

23:37.767 --> 23:39.678
You didn't tell me your name.

24:03.607 --> 24:06.679
So, how many other girls do you bring here?

24:07.567 --> 24:08.795
Hundreds.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.599
Thousands.

24:10.647 --> 24:13.036
- You must be courting dozens at least.
- No.

24:13.087 --> 24:14.805
You can tell me the truth.

24:14.847 --> 24:16.838
There's only you.

24:20.047 --> 24:22.436
There's only you.

24:31.487 --> 24:34.399
Tell me, what are your actual relations
with this young thing?

24:34.447 --> 24:38.759
- A fraction of respect, man.
- It's not like that. Sibyl's sacred.

24:40.487 --> 24:43.206
It's only the scared things
that are worth touching.

24:43.247 --> 24:45.715
People nowadays fear their passions.

24:45.767 --> 24:47.837
- Well, I don't.
- Of course you do.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.640
We're taught terror from the nursery.

24:50.687 --> 24:53.440
Terror of God,

24:53.487 --> 24:54.761
or, even worse, of scandal.

24:54.847 --> 24:57.839
We're taught to spend our entire lives
cowering in self-denial.

24:59.527 --> 25:03.884
The truth, Mr Gray, is that every
impulse we strangle only poisons us.

25:03.927 --> 25:06.316
You'll make him wish
he'd never mentioned the girl.

25:06.367 --> 25:08.278
Voila, monsieur.

25:08.327 --> 25:10.238
There's something missing.

25:19.047 --> 25:20.560
Thank you, Harry.

25:20.607 --> 25:22.802
I took the liberty of filling it with my blend.

25:32.327 --> 25:34.238
Oh, Dorian.

25:34.287 --> 25:36.437
- It's beautiful.

25:37.567 --> 25:40.035
I just thought it would suit you.

26:07.407 --> 26:10.399
I should be going. Jim will worry.

26:10.447 --> 26:11.880
Of course.

26:15.927 --> 26:17.645
Or we could...

26:18.607 --> 26:20.165
I mean...

26:21.007 --> 26:23.237
You could...

26:24.207 --> 26:25.526
...stay...

26:26.447 --> 26:27.880
...here...

26:28.687 --> 26:30.598
...with me.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.398
We shouldn't be afraid of our feelings, Sib.

26:34.447 --> 26:35.721
It's just...

26:35.767 --> 26:37.564
I've seen other girls

26:37.607 --> 26:40.997
who give themselves, and then
I've seen what becomes of them.

26:41.047 --> 26:42.480
I love you.

26:47.927 --> 26:51.078
Forgive me. I didn't mean...

26:55.887 --> 26:58.321
You're all I ever want in the world.

27:37.567 --> 27:39.205
<i>Boy!</i>

27:44.087 --> 27:46.521
You might have a little scar there.

27:46.567 --> 27:48.523
Well, it won't be a first.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.284
My back.

27:57.487 --> 27:58.806
What?

28:08.207 --> 28:10.118
You're perfect.

28:12.367 --> 28:14.323
- Engaged?
- It's wonderful, isn't it?

28:16.167 --> 28:18.237
I wanted you all to be the first to know.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.802
- Congratulations, Dorian.
- Thank you.

28:21.207 --> 28:24.324
May I ask how you came
to propose marriage?

28:24.367 --> 28:26.801
I suppose I didn't really make a formal proposal.

28:26.847 --> 28:30.886
I told her I loved her. She said it was
her dream come true to be my wife.

28:33.207 --> 28:35.038
Women are wonderfully practical.

28:36.327 --> 28:38.522
Will you all come
and see her perform tonight?

28:40.527 --> 28:42.438
I'm afraid I have an engagement.

28:45.567 --> 28:47.444
And we're due at the Burdons.

28:51.407 --> 28:55.036
Tell Burdon I'll see him tomorrow.
Why don't you hail us a hansom?

28:55.087 --> 28:57.442
- I love acting.
- Goodbye, ladies.

28:57.487 --> 28:59.523
So much more real than life.

28:59.567 --> 29:02.001
I hope you're pleased with yourself.

29:02.047 --> 29:03.958
Every experience is of value.

29:04.007 --> 29:06.680
And marriage is certainly an experience.

29:08.767 --> 29:11.486
Nobody is amused this time, Henry.

29:13.487 --> 29:15.398
I'll talk to him.

29:17.887 --> 29:21.323
I got the sense the others
don't quite approve. Especially Basil.

29:21.367 --> 29:24.518
Perhaps Basil should be a little more
fearless with his own feelings.

29:26.847 --> 29:29.805
I thought we might make a little stop
en route to the theatre.

29:30.967 --> 29:32.685
I too have news.

29:33.887 --> 29:36.560
It seems my wife is with child.

29:36.607 --> 29:38.518
Oh, congratulations.

29:38.567 --> 29:41.035
Don't be absurd.
It's the beginning of the end.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.560
So, indulge me.

29:48.127 --> 29:50.402
- Ah, Harry.
- Alan.

29:50.447 --> 29:52.563
Firkytoodling at last, I see.

29:55.207 --> 29:58.438
- Come along, ladies.
- It's good to see you.

30:02.487 --> 30:04.318
How delightful.

30:04.367 --> 30:05.720
Hello.

30:07.887 --> 30:09.479
Drink up.

30:09.527 --> 30:13.122
It won't be long before
you're anchored to the perambulator.

30:13.167 --> 30:14.919
I don't think so.

30:14.967 --> 30:16.798
Our friend is to marry.

30:16.847 --> 30:20.362
Ah, but we haven't had a chance
to win your heart.

30:20.407 --> 30:22.477
Oh, well.

30:22.527 --> 30:24.722
Farewell to youth.

30:28.287 --> 30:29.356
No.

30:32.607 --> 30:34.245
Watch your step.

30:38.767 --> 30:41.156
Does Victoria know you come here?

30:41.207 --> 30:45.485
My dear boy, marriage makes a life
of deception absolutely necessary.

30:49.687 --> 30:52.042
Well, perhaps I have
a stronger conscience.

30:52.087 --> 30:54.885
Conscience is just
a polite term for cowardice.

31:01.487 --> 31:04.524
No civilised man regrets a pleasure.

31:17.327 --> 31:19.045
You see?

31:21.247 --> 31:24.125
The only way to get rid of a temptation
is to yield to it.

31:35.007 --> 31:38.124
Be searching always
for new sensations, Dorian.

31:41.607 --> 31:43.086
Come.

31:44.007 --> 31:45.918
Come upstairs.

31:45.967 --> 31:48.037
Forbid yourself nothing.

31:49.047 --> 31:50.275
Come.

31:50.327 --> 31:53.478
- Nobody at all need know.
- Come with me.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.318
The pleasure is all mine.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.006
- I've heard so much about you.
- And I you.

32:35.047 --> 32:38.164
Did you enjoy the show?
I couldn't see you in the audience.

32:38.207 --> 32:40.004
I'm afraid we ran a little late.

32:40.047 --> 32:42.038
Oh, where were you?

32:42.087 --> 32:43.805
At the club.

32:43.847 --> 32:46.805
The truth is, my dear,
we were celebrating your wonderful news.

32:47.727 --> 32:49.445
Very many congratulations.

32:49.487 --> 32:52.001
And Harry is to be a father.

32:52.047 --> 32:53.480
How wonderful.

32:53.527 --> 32:55.245
- Indeed.
- In one.

32:55.287 --> 32:57.323
I'm sure you're eager to start a family, too?

32:57.367 --> 32:59.005
Very much.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.317
Well, not quite yet.

33:05.407 --> 33:07.602
- Good night.
- Good night, Charlie.

33:07.647 --> 33:09.239
'Night.

33:10.967 --> 33:13.197
We're a little young, don't you think?

33:13.247 --> 33:14.805
Are we?

33:17.967 --> 33:19.878
Perhaps I should take my leave.

33:20.807 --> 33:22.718
- Good night.
- Er...

33:22.767 --> 33:24.962
See you tomorrow, Harry.

33:25.007 --> 33:26.440
I'm sure.

33:35.927 --> 33:38.282
I don't think we need to rush, that's all.

33:43.247 --> 33:45.158
You sound different.

33:46.167 --> 33:47.919
Not at all.

33:49.967 --> 33:51.878
Were you at the club all night?

33:52.727 --> 33:53.842
Yes.

33:56.287 --> 33:58.198
He's a better liar than you.

33:59.247 --> 34:00.396
What?

34:02.527 --> 34:05.200
I was just saying everything is so soon.

34:05.247 --> 34:09.126
- I gave myself to you. I thought you loved me.
- And I do!

34:09.167 --> 34:11.726
Then make me your wife,
not one of your whores!

34:13.286 --> 34:15.880
I think perhaps I ought to go.

34:16.766 --> 34:18.678
Don't let him do this, Dorian.

34:22.766 --> 34:25.645
- This has nothing to do with Harry.
- You said you loved me!

34:25.687 --> 34:27.199
And I do! I do!

34:27.246 --> 34:29.123
Dorian, please!

34:29.167 --> 34:32.398
Please, Dorian! Please, I love you!

35:35.207 --> 35:37.960
Oh, Henry! Dorian!

35:39.047 --> 35:42.119
Tell me, how was last night's performance?

35:48.367 --> 35:50.244
I'm sorry.

35:52.727 --> 35:54.877
Have a drink.

35:54.927 --> 35:57.646
I can introduce you to the artist later, if you like.

36:00.207 --> 36:02.118
Never marry, Mr Gray.

36:03.127 --> 36:05.721
It's the only way to keep all one's illusions.

36:08.367 --> 36:11.518
Chin up, dear boy.
You've a face like a slapped nancy.

36:13.007 --> 36:14.918
You'll love again.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.763
And again.
Do you have your cigarettes?

36:17.807 --> 36:19.399
Of course.

36:25.367 --> 36:27.562
Don't fear it, Dorian.

36:28.847 --> 36:30.758
The world is yours.

36:32.007 --> 36:34.202
For a season.

36:49.607 --> 36:51.962
Hello, Victor.
Could you fetch us a bottle of the?

36:52.007 --> 36:53.565
Anything!

36:54.527 --> 36:56.995
- What's the matter?
- You've a visitor, sir.

36:57.047 --> 37:00.357
A Mr Vane. He seems disturbed.

37:00.407 --> 37:02.284
We'll wait in the library.

37:02.327 --> 37:04.238
Victor, how about that bottle?

37:37.967 --> 37:39.685
To what do I owe the pleasure, Jim?

37:45.927 --> 37:49.840
Can I er...
Can I get you something to drink?

37:52.167 --> 37:54.635
I don't want this in my house.

37:55.687 --> 37:58.724
What happened with Sibyl
was very unfortunate.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.758
But this was a gift

38:00.807 --> 38:02.798
and she really should keep...

38:04.567 --> 38:06.239
It's filthy.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.682
She was wearing it
when they pulled her from the river.

38:13.007 --> 38:15.316
Why on earth was she?

38:20.447 --> 38:22.358
She... she can't...

38:23.607 --> 38:25.518
She can't...

38:32.927 --> 38:36.556
I wanted you to know... she loved you.

38:36.607 --> 38:38.643
She was going to have your child.

38:41.127 --> 38:42.924
And you killed her.

38:45.567 --> 38:47.523
Jim! Jim!

39:05.327 --> 39:06.806
Get up!

39:06.847 --> 39:08.758
Are you all right, sir?

39:08.807 --> 39:10.763
Let me...

39:10.807 --> 39:13.685
- help you up.
- Sibyl's dead.

39:13.727 --> 39:16.560
- Now, now.
- Good night, ladies.

39:16.607 --> 39:18.438
(Jim sobs and shouts)

39:18.487 --> 39:20.557
Get up. Get up!

39:22.687 --> 39:27.761
We can't have maniacs threatening
decent people in their own homes.

39:27.807 --> 39:30.605
Alan treats a number
of such deranged cases at Broadmoor.

39:30.687 --> 39:32.643
Just until he settles down.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.886
I'm confident any inquest
into this unfortunate business

39:36.927 --> 39:39.600
will find no connection
whatsoever with Mr Gray.

39:46.807 --> 39:48.923
- Taking you downtown.

40:07.087 --> 40:08.998
This wasn't your fault, Dorian.

40:10.527 --> 40:13.041
- Kelso said I was death.
- Well, he was wrong.

40:13.087 --> 40:14.566
Salome.

40:14.647 --> 40:15.875
<i>Harry?</i>

40:15.927 --> 40:17.804
You're not making sense.

40:17.847 --> 40:19.280
No! Please!

40:21.767 --> 40:23.405
He's part of me, Harry.

40:23.487 --> 40:25.682
- I turn all love into death.
- Dorian. Dorian!

40:25.727 --> 40:27.319
Into death. Death!

40:28.327 --> 40:31.205
Kelso was a bitter ruin of a man
and he's dead.

40:31.247 --> 40:33.078
What's past is past.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.837
Experience makes us strong, Dorian.

40:39.807 --> 40:42.196
And you need to see this episode
for what it really is.

40:44.407 --> 40:46.318
An extraordinary experience.

40:47.807 --> 40:50.275
- I can't be so heartless.
- It isn't heartless.

40:50.327 --> 40:52.238
It's finding a perspective.

40:52.287 --> 40:55.165
Most lack the strength
to rise above life's suffering.

40:56.407 --> 40:58.318
To rule one's emotions,

40:58.367 --> 41:00.756
to savour them...

41:02.767 --> 41:04.678
...that takes a man of will.

41:05.567 --> 41:07.478
Alan left this for you.

41:08.407 --> 41:10.318
Drink. Doctor's orders.

41:13.407 --> 41:15.318
I should be going.

41:19.567 --> 41:21.478
I'll call in the morning.

41:22.487 --> 41:24.443
Thank you, Harry.

41:35.647 --> 41:38.002
You are a man of will, Dorian.

41:38.047 --> 41:39.958
I knew it from the first.

43:10.767 --> 43:12.564
Dorian, Dorian...

43:12.607 --> 43:14.802
I'm so, so sorry.

43:14.847 --> 43:17.202
Harry... Harry told me about poor Sibyl.

43:17.247 --> 43:18.965
If there's anything I can do...

43:19.007 --> 43:21.680
You're very kind. I'm actually
just on my way to see Harry now.

43:21.727 --> 43:24.082
- Are you coming to the Radleys' ball?
- Er...

43:26.487 --> 43:28.398
Where's my picture?

43:28.447 --> 43:30.836
The light was too strong in here.

43:30.887 --> 43:34.516
The light was perfect.
Where have you put it?

43:34.567 --> 43:36.478
It's quite safe.

43:36.527 --> 43:38.757
The truth is,
I don't want it on public show.

43:39.687 --> 43:41.996
It's just too valuable.

43:44.367 --> 43:47.757
I could forgive the vagaries of grief
if you actually seemed to be grieving.

43:47.807 --> 43:49.286
I was...

43:49.327 --> 43:50.646
stricken.

43:50.687 --> 43:52.996
But what's past is past.

43:54.687 --> 43:57.247
Every experience is of value. Drink?

44:00.327 --> 44:02.682
You shouldn't believe
every word Harry says.

44:04.207 --> 44:05.925
He doesn't.

44:16.887 --> 44:20.641
Isn't this all just ghastly?
Radley gloating with pitiful pride

44:20.687 --> 44:22.325
while his love-starved wife

44:22.367 --> 44:25.245
parades her daughter
like a sow truffling for husbands.

44:25.287 --> 44:26.959
Delightful little filly.

44:27.007 --> 44:28.838
And poor Celia.

44:28.887 --> 44:32.675
Trussed up in a doily for some
chinless miscreant to eternally enslave.

44:34.927 --> 44:36.838
I suggest we raise a little hell.

44:38.927 --> 44:40.963
Allow me to introduce myself.

44:41.007 --> 44:43.601
I know who you are, Mr Gray.

44:43.647 --> 44:46.684
Allow me to offer my congratulations
on your ravishing debut.

44:46.727 --> 44:48.877
Perhaps a small toast.

44:48.927 --> 44:50.565
To what?

44:52.447 --> 44:53.675
Intoxication.

45:15.967 --> 45:17.685
- Here she comes.
- Who?

45:17.727 --> 45:19.638
- Celia?

45:22.527 --> 45:24.438
- Celia?
- Problem, Lady Radley?

45:25.767 --> 45:27.678
My daughter, I can't find her.

45:27.727 --> 45:29.922
And nor can I find your Mr Gray.

45:32.607 --> 45:36.600
Perhaps they're in the garden.
The arrangements are marvellous.

45:37.447 --> 45:38.402
Ah.

45:38.447 --> 45:40.677
Might I hazard
an alternative suggestion?

45:44.327 --> 45:46.522
d Waltz

45:59.927 --> 46:01.519
Celia!

46:01.567 --> 46:03.876
- Is something the matter?
- Celia!

46:07.487 --> 46:09.842
Where is my daughter, you beast?

46:09.887 --> 46:12.355
I was just attending to my costume.

46:12.407 --> 46:17.197
A little of Lord Radley's very fine
Burgundy was spilt on my shirt cuff.

46:19.967 --> 46:22.197
Oh. Oh...

46:23.167 --> 46:24.998
Mr Gray, I...

46:25.047 --> 46:27.959
- Lord Henry gave me to understand...
- A mistake.

46:28.007 --> 46:30.475
Nobody at all need know.

46:33.487 --> 46:35.796
You're too kind, Mr Gray.

46:37.247 --> 46:39.602
- Thank you.
- It must be difficult,

46:39.647 --> 46:41.558
a party like this.

46:42.527 --> 46:44.438
Seeing your daughter come of age.

46:46.127 --> 46:48.243
Makes you long for your own youth.

46:50.967 --> 46:52.525
I...

46:52.567 --> 46:54.478
Madam, forgive me but...

46:56.447 --> 46:58.836
...you are exquisite.

47:01.047 --> 47:02.924
Oh, Mr Gray.

47:02.967 --> 47:05.356
This is most improper.

47:07.327 --> 47:08.601
Ooh...

47:10.007 --> 47:11.156
Ah!

47:17.247 --> 47:18.202
Oh!

47:52.607 --> 47:54.484
Now, where were we?

47:56.447 --> 47:58.438
What are you grinning about, Gray?

47:59.367 --> 48:01.403
I think Harry's just lost a wager.

48:01.447 --> 48:04.757
Well, come on, out with it.
We're all gambling men here.

48:04.807 --> 48:06.843
Just a little round of double or nothing.

48:08.407 --> 48:12.036
Of course, a good gambler
understands that there are limits.

48:12.087 --> 48:14.123
There are no limits.

49:09.367 --> 49:11.278
Have a wonderful birthday, Dorian!

49:20.327 --> 49:22.045
Dorian.

49:22.087 --> 49:24.726
This crush is your finest yet.

49:24.767 --> 49:27.998
One has to do something
to null the pain of age.

49:28.047 --> 49:30.163
Do tell my husband
not to be so disagreeable.

49:30.207 --> 49:32.118
But I always agree with him.

49:33.087 --> 49:35.885
Congratulations, Basil.
I hear you have a new exhibition.

49:35.927 --> 49:37.804
Yes, yes, in Paris.

49:37.847 --> 49:40.441
Yes, in fact, I wanted
to ask a question of you, Dorian.

49:40.487 --> 49:42.955
I'd like to make your portrait
my principal piece.

49:43.007 --> 49:47.205
Oh, yes, that picture.
Absolutely wonderful.

49:47.247 --> 49:50.922
- Whatever became of it?
- I haven't seen it myself in months.

49:50.967 --> 49:53.606
- He's very protective of it, aren't you?
- Indeed I am.

49:53.647 --> 49:56.241
I'm very sorry, Basil,
but it's just too precious.

49:57.967 --> 50:00.117
I won't have it out of the house.

50:19.287 --> 50:21.755
I beg your pardon.

50:21.807 --> 50:23.638
Did you want me?

50:26.007 --> 50:30.125
That picture is my finest work
and it'd be greatly appreciated...

50:30.167 --> 50:32.886
The greatest gift that anyone
could ever have given.

50:33.727 --> 50:35.080
In fact...

50:36.607 --> 50:39.724
In fact, I wish that
I could tell you just how great.

50:41.167 --> 50:45.046
But then it isn't so unreasonable
to borrow it back a little while.

50:46.607 --> 50:48.518
I'm not sure that I've ever...

50:49.247 --> 50:51.681
...fully expressed my gratitude.

50:54.447 --> 50:56.165
I hardly think...

52:16.687 --> 52:18.598
I have the key to your heart.

52:21.047 --> 52:23.845
Don't touch that ever!

52:23.887 --> 52:24.922
Dorian!

52:30.207 --> 52:31.959
He's young.

52:32.007 --> 52:33.918
But he was never cruel

52:33.967 --> 52:36.162
till he met you.

52:39.527 --> 52:41.404
That's mine.

53:03.647 --> 53:06.207
Oh, it's you.

53:09.207 --> 53:11.880
- I thought you'd gone home.
- I just needed a walk.

53:11.927 --> 53:14.725
I was just about to go to bed.
Everyone's left.

53:14.767 --> 53:16.678
I'm here to see you, not them.

53:17.727 --> 53:19.080
Really?

53:24.047 --> 53:25.958
Wait, wait.

53:29.407 --> 53:31.284
I don't know where to begin.

53:31.327 --> 53:33.443
How ominous.

53:36.647 --> 53:39.684
- You terrified that poor boy tonight.
- He seemed to recover.

53:39.727 --> 53:42.639
Is that what you tell yourself
about Celia Radley?

53:42.687 --> 53:45.565
Look, I'm sorry about her misfortune.

53:45.647 --> 53:47.603
But do you really believe that I'm to blame?

53:52.447 --> 53:55.325
When I look at you,
I find it impossible to imagine.

53:56.607 --> 53:59.280
But I know you're treating people poorly.

53:59.327 --> 54:00.840
Even me,

54:00.887 --> 54:04.641
when I ask you the small favour
that you loan me my own picture...

54:04.687 --> 54:07.565
- Is that what this is about?
- No, it's about a good deal more!

54:17.407 --> 54:18.840
Dorian...

54:39.487 --> 54:42.684
What happened
to the Dorian Gray I painted?

54:42.727 --> 54:44.843
You just don't understand.

54:49.647 --> 54:51.365
I will always...

54:51.407 --> 54:53.443
be that Dorian.

54:56.687 --> 54:58.803
Can I trust you, Basil?

55:01.167 --> 55:04.762
Would you like to see
why you can never exhibit that picture?

55:24.847 --> 55:26.758
What's the matter?

55:27.807 --> 55:29.718
Don't you recognise me?

55:29.767 --> 55:31.678
What have you?

55:32.527 --> 55:34.324
That thing...

55:34.367 --> 55:36.437
It isn't what...

55:36.487 --> 55:39.081
Together, we've created
something beautiful.

55:42.967 --> 55:44.878
It's a miracle.

55:49.167 --> 55:51.078
Look at me.

55:52.367 --> 55:54.039
Look at me.

55:55.687 --> 55:57.598
Because of your painting...

55:58.727 --> 56:02.163
- It's not...
...this will never age.

56:02.207 --> 56:04.357
Will never scar.

56:09.327 --> 56:11.158
Can you even imagine

56:11.207 --> 56:13.641
being able to do anything you please...

56:15.807 --> 56:18.002
...and live out every whim and impulse

56:18.047 --> 56:20.561
while the world just sees you gleam?

56:20.607 --> 56:22.325
This isn't you.

56:22.367 --> 56:24.676
I know this isn't you. We can stop it!

56:24.727 --> 56:26.957
Basil, please, don't.

56:27.007 --> 56:30.204
Don't you see
that this must be destroyed?

56:30.247 --> 56:32.158
Dorian, I want to help you.

56:32.207 --> 56:35.483
We'll find a priest or a spirit-worker.

56:37.407 --> 56:40.080
There's good in your heart. I've seen it.

56:40.127 --> 56:42.322
You're not this...

56:42.367 --> 56:44.039
this devil!

56:48.047 --> 56:49.799
I'm a god.

56:51.327 --> 56:52.601
Basil.

56:53.327 --> 56:54.601
Basil!

59:10.487 --> 59:12.079
Good evening.

59:15.047 --> 59:16.958
Need some help, sir?

59:20.847 --> 59:22.439
How kind.

59:26.607 --> 59:27.756
All right.

59:33.527 --> 59:35.404
Mind how you go, sir.

59:35.447 --> 59:37.278
On you go.

01:01:35.807 --> 01:01:37.638
Good day, Lady Victoria.

01:01:38.487 --> 01:01:42.162
I was about to take Harry for lunch at Scott's.
Why don't you join us?

01:01:43.127 --> 01:01:46.164
Oh, Dorian. You haven't heard.

01:01:48.007 --> 01:01:51.124
They've found Basil's body in the river.

01:01:56.967 --> 01:01:58.764
<i>Thou art slave to Fate,</i>

01:01:58.807 --> 01:02:02.083
Chance, kings and desperate men,

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:06.359
And dost with poyson, warre
and sicknesse dwell,

01:02:07.447 --> 01:02:10.644
And poppies or charmes
can make us sleepe as well,

01:02:10.687 --> 01:02:12.598
And better than thy stroake.

01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:15.678
Why swell'st thou then?

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.722
One short sleepe past,

01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:21.678
we wake eternally.

01:02:22.887 --> 01:02:25.162
And death shall be no more.

01:02:27.887 --> 01:02:30.560
Death, thou shalt die.

01:02:48.007 --> 01:02:50.919
Farewell, dear Basil.

01:02:53.367 --> 01:02:55.483
<i>I spoke to the police again this morning.</i>

01:02:55.527 --> 01:02:58.758
And have the buffoons managed
to make a single inch of progress?

01:02:58.807 --> 01:03:01.116
They're convinced it was
some Shadwell renter.

01:03:01.167 --> 01:03:03.078
They think they'll catch him.

01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:05.960
So Basil's name
will be dragged through the gutter.

01:03:08.527 --> 01:03:10.438
I'm of a mind to take a trip, Harry.

01:03:12.007 --> 01:03:13.918
Maybe you should join me.

01:03:13.967 --> 01:03:16.197
- Where are you going?
- Everywhere.

01:03:16.247 --> 01:03:18.317
I leave tomorrow.

01:03:18.367 --> 01:03:19.720
With all this?

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:24.000
Someone once gave me some fine advice...

01:03:25.207 --> 01:03:27.562
...about taking perspective.

01:03:27.607 --> 01:03:29.359
Come with me.

01:03:34.007 --> 01:03:36.475
The child is imminent.

01:03:38.127 --> 01:03:40.038
Tell me everything.

01:03:43.847 --> 01:03:45.565
I always do.

01:04:11.287 --> 01:04:14.404
<i>I've entered the tombs of dead nations,</i>

01:04:14.447 --> 01:04:17.325
<i>ridden with our last savage tribes.</i>

01:04:17.367 --> 01:04:19.164
<i>I feel the brilliance of every moment,</i>

01:04:19.207 --> 01:04:21.402
<i>the splendour of existence and its awful...</i>

01:04:21.447 --> 01:04:25.998
<i>... keen as the edge of a blade,
this desperate will to see, touch and...</i>

01:04:26.047 --> 01:04:30.325
<i>Dearest Harry, you taught me
that life must burn with a hard flame.</i>

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.403
<i>Its light does not blind me,</i>

01:04:32.447 --> 01:04:34.278
<i>nor its heat sear me.</i>

01:04:34.327 --> 01:04:36.204
<i>I am the flame, Harry.</i>

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.238
<i>I am the flame.</i>

01:05:36.127 --> 01:05:39.483
Women never have anything to say,
but they say it charmingly.

01:05:39.527 --> 01:05:41.961
They're the great triumph of matter over mind.

01:05:44.927 --> 01:05:46.519
Well, here I am.

01:06:17.927 --> 01:06:19.246
Dorian.

01:06:20.047 --> 01:06:21.958
You look so...

01:06:23.087 --> 01:06:24.361
...so...

01:06:31.247 --> 01:06:33.158
He looks magnificent.

01:06:34.447 --> 01:06:38.326
We have heard such tales.

01:06:39.447 --> 01:06:43.360
I'm afraid they're all absolutely
and entirely... true.

01:06:47.607 --> 01:06:49.325
Welcome back.

01:06:49.367 --> 01:06:51.278
Some champagne?

01:06:52.087 --> 01:06:53.805
Yes.

01:06:58.647 --> 01:07:00.000
A-ha!

01:07:00.047 --> 01:07:01.958
My missing guest of honour.

01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:06.005
I'm coming.

01:07:13.647 --> 01:07:15.558
I was sorry for your loss.

01:07:21.007 --> 01:07:23.123
You know, I kept hearing this phrase.

01:07:24.647 --> 01:07:26.558
"Natural causes."

01:07:28.887 --> 01:07:30.923
Nature has a great deal to answer for.

01:07:31.887 --> 01:07:34.640
She was so looking forward
to the life of a divorcee.

01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:37.199
And poor old Basil...

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:42.162
If we paid the police by results,
we'd save the Treasury thousands.

01:07:43.767 --> 01:07:46.156
When your letters stopped coming,
I feared the worst.

01:07:46.207 --> 01:07:48.118
But here you are.

01:07:49.887 --> 01:07:52.003
So never mind the country estate.

01:07:52.047 --> 01:07:55.084
Tell me, why are you really back?

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:59.598
- I'm tired.
- You don't look it.

01:07:59.687 --> 01:08:01.678
You have no right to melancholy.

01:08:01.727 --> 01:08:03.524
Your life is exquisite.

01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:07.196
You've drunk deeply of everything
and it hasn't left a fleck on you.

01:08:08.287 --> 01:08:09.746
Do you remember
when I first came to London?

01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:11.205
Do you remember
when I first came to London?

01:08:14.367 --> 01:08:16.118
I felt so...

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:18.880
Those were the great days.

01:08:18.926 --> 01:08:22.761
Dorian, it's quite clear
why you've lost your passion for life.

01:08:23.807 --> 01:08:26.879
You've been away from me for too long.

01:08:26.926 --> 01:08:29.122
We must go out.

01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:31.078
Take on the town, as we used to.

01:08:36.367 --> 01:08:39.598
- I've missed you, Harry.
- I must ask you, though...

01:08:43.367 --> 01:08:45.085
What is your secret?

01:08:46.207 --> 01:08:49.596
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.

01:08:51.807 --> 01:08:53.718
You still have it, I see.

01:08:55.247 --> 01:08:57.602
- From Cairo.
- Where else?

01:09:05.487 --> 01:09:06.920
Smile.

01:09:11.207 --> 01:09:12.560
Emily.

01:09:14.006 --> 01:09:16.157
May I?

01:09:18.006 --> 01:09:20.680
I hope I'm not interrupting
your reminiscence?

01:09:20.727 --> 01:09:23.479
The one charm of the past
is that it's the past.

01:09:23.527 --> 01:09:27.486
Oh. I hope you're not also a dreary old cynic?

01:09:27.527 --> 01:09:29.245
What is there to believe in?

01:09:30.926 --> 01:09:33.282
Our developments.

01:09:34.287 --> 01:09:36.084
All I see is decay.

01:09:37.167 --> 01:09:38.600
Well, religion?

01:09:38.647 --> 01:09:41.002
Fashionable substitute for belief.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:43.002
- Art?
- A malady.

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:44.844
- Love?
- An illusion.

01:09:44.886 --> 01:09:46.877
Bravo!

01:09:46.926 --> 01:09:50.283
Well, you both cut the world to pieces,
don't you?

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.443
Thank you for the cigarette.

01:09:54.807 --> 01:09:56.684
Unusual woman.

01:09:56.727 --> 01:09:59.036
She ought to be. She's my daughter.

01:10:11.647 --> 01:10:12.875
Lie down.

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:40.246
Dorian?

01:10:42.927 --> 01:10:44.724
Dorian...

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.160
It's you.

01:10:47.207 --> 01:10:48.560
Dorian!

01:10:55.247 --> 01:10:57.477
Oi, mister! Give us a penny!

01:10:59.007 --> 01:11:02.443
Oi, mister. Mister. Penny for the Guy?

01:11:02.487 --> 01:11:04.523
- Have you been in the war?
- I'm too old.

01:11:04.567 --> 01:11:07.001
Give us a couple of bob
for a drink, will you?

01:13:08.887 --> 01:13:11.003
Get up. Get up!

01:13:15.727 --> 01:13:17.240
You...

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.436
Yeah, you... Dorian Gray.

01:13:20.527 --> 01:13:23.166
- I think you're mistaken.
- I knew one day you'd come back.

01:13:23.207 --> 01:13:26.324
- Wait, please...
- So many years I've waited.

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:28.403
Wait! How many years?

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:30.278
- No more!
- How many years?

01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:32.318
Look at me. Look at my face.

01:13:35.727 --> 01:13:37.638
I'm barely 20, man.

01:13:46.127 --> 01:13:48.163
Can't be.

01:13:50.327 --> 01:13:52.124
I don't know this...

01:13:52.207 --> 01:13:53.765
this Dorian Gray.

01:13:56.527 --> 01:13:58.757
I think, sir, you are not well.

01:13:59.967 --> 01:14:01.195
I...

01:14:02.047 --> 01:14:03.605
Hospital.

01:14:04.687 --> 01:14:06.723
They hurt me.

01:14:09.407 --> 01:14:11.284
You tell him...

01:14:11.327 --> 01:14:13.238
You tell him I'm coming.

01:14:48.327 --> 01:14:50.238
A visitor, sir.

01:14:55.887 --> 01:14:57.798
To what do I owe the pleasure?

01:14:57.847 --> 01:15:00.236
I thought you might like to join me for lunch.

01:15:02.447 --> 01:15:04.244
No, I don't think...

01:15:04.287 --> 01:15:06.198
I made a picnic.

01:15:08.687 --> 01:15:10.598
Yes, well, I'm afraid I...

01:15:12.687 --> 01:15:14.598
I'd rather stay at home today.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.566
Serious?

01:15:20.407 --> 01:15:21.965
It's going to rain.

01:15:23.087 --> 01:15:24.998
Tell me, Mr Gray.

01:15:25.767 --> 01:15:28.804
Must you always play the cynic?

01:15:28.847 --> 01:15:30.246
Hm?

01:15:33.887 --> 01:15:35.320
Look up.

01:15:36.287 --> 01:15:38.676
- Actually, I'd rather you didn't...

01:15:40.047 --> 01:15:42.356
Oblige me, Mr Gray.

01:15:42.407 --> 01:15:45.240
Have you been pursuing
this delightful hobby for long?

01:15:45.287 --> 01:15:47.437
- No. It's a gift from my father.

01:15:47.487 --> 01:15:52.481
In return, he made me promise that I
wouldn't chain myself to more railings.

01:15:54.367 --> 01:15:56.039
For suffrage, Mr Gray.

01:15:56.087 --> 01:15:59.079
Well, don't you think that
women should be given the vote?

01:15:59.127 --> 01:16:02.756
I don't believe a woman should be
given anything she can't wear at night.

01:16:02.807 --> 01:16:05.082
What a loss to the Front you are.

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:08.403
Think of all those Germans that
you could bayonet with your epigrams.

01:16:08.447 --> 01:16:10.915
I do apologise if I offend.

01:16:11.007 --> 01:16:13.919
Oh, no, you'll have to do
rather better to offend me.

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:17.277
Then I humbly vow to redouble my efforts.

01:16:21.447 --> 01:16:24.007
You know, I wonder if it's true,
what they say about you.

01:16:25.207 --> 01:16:27.596
That beneath all the charm,

01:16:27.647 --> 01:16:29.683
you're in fact quite heartless?

01:16:29.727 --> 01:16:32.116
They say I'm charming?

01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:35.000
They say that you devote
your whole life to pleasure.

01:16:36.207 --> 01:16:38.437
Well, it's clearly to be recommended.

01:16:38.487 --> 01:16:42.924
If I look as good as you in 25 years,
I shall be thoroughly happy.

01:16:42.967 --> 01:16:45.845
I can assure you,
pleasure is very different from happiness.

01:16:50.247 --> 01:16:54.559
I mean, some things are more precious
because they don't last.

01:16:56.007 --> 01:16:57.599
Mr Gray...

01:16:59.767 --> 01:17:01.758
...I believe I know your secret.

01:17:07.207 --> 01:17:09.118
You do have a heart.

01:17:10.087 --> 01:17:13.523
Those who go beneath the surface
do so at their peril.

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:17.918
How terrifying.

01:17:38.727 --> 01:17:41.287
I may let you chauffeur me again, Mr Gray.

01:17:45.287 --> 01:17:47.755
So, I'll see you at Toynbee Hall tonight?

01:17:49.887 --> 01:17:51.525
Until then.

01:18:18.807 --> 01:18:20.638
Alice.

01:18:24.127 --> 01:18:27.676
I'd crawl the sewers before
I'd let my flesh and blood near him.

01:18:27.727 --> 01:18:30.036
- Sit down, Grandad!
- What kind of unholiness

01:18:30.087 --> 01:18:33.636
grants the face of a babe
to such a man?

01:18:33.687 --> 01:18:35.996
Come along! Come along, my dear!

01:18:38.087 --> 01:18:40.362
Completely unnatural!

01:18:42.367 --> 01:18:43.800
What?

01:18:43.847 --> 01:18:46.407
- Let him play!
- Quiet, please, ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:06.327 --> 01:19:09.478
You know, anyone would think
you're ashamed to be seen with me.

01:19:11.047 --> 01:19:12.958
What happened in the hall?

01:19:13.007 --> 01:19:14.918
I don't know what you mean.

01:19:15.967 --> 01:19:18.003
You saw something.

01:19:18.047 --> 01:19:19.958
You're mistaken.

01:19:20.967 --> 01:19:22.719
<i>Well, I heard that he killed him.</i>

01:19:26.127 --> 01:19:28.038
<i>We never ever again...</i>

01:19:28.087 --> 01:19:30.078
Mr Gray!

01:19:30.127 --> 01:19:32.687
It would be better
if we were not seen together.

01:19:32.727 --> 01:19:34.479
Better for whom?

01:19:34.527 --> 01:19:36.518
Tongues may wag against you.

01:19:36.567 --> 01:19:38.956
I don't care what they say.

01:19:41.487 --> 01:19:42.966
You should.

01:19:44.367 --> 01:19:45.880
The truth is,

01:19:45.927 --> 01:19:47.883
I've done dreadful things.

01:19:48.967 --> 01:19:50.798
My life...

01:19:50.847 --> 01:19:54.044
My life has been a monstrous corruption.

01:19:56.807 --> 01:19:59.002
And there will be a price.

01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:04.680
I won't let anyone hurt you.

01:20:14.927 --> 01:20:16.963
We should not meet again.

01:20:17.007 --> 01:20:19.202
I told you it was him.

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.158
Step back.

01:20:26.567 --> 01:20:28.478
<i>I'm coming for you, Dorian Gray.</i>

01:20:31.207 --> 01:20:33.118
<i>You dirty bastard!</i>

01:20:34.047 --> 01:20:36.766
<i>Dorian Gray, you bastard!</i>

01:20:48.247 --> 01:20:49.885
<i>You're a disgrace!</i>

01:20:54.127 --> 01:20:55.355
Good evening, sir.

01:20:55.407 --> 01:20:58.717
Mr Harcourt here thinks
there may be rats nesting in the attic.

01:20:58.767 --> 01:21:00.997
- I haven't the key.
- Get out of my house.

01:21:02.967 --> 01:21:05.162
But, Mr Gray...

01:21:07.167 --> 01:21:09.044
And you.

01:21:19.287 --> 01:21:21.198
With respect, sir...

01:21:22.487 --> 01:21:25.047
...l've been with your family
for two generations.

01:21:25.087 --> 01:21:27.043
Your effects will follow.

01:22:03.567 --> 01:22:05.285
- Argh!

01:22:19.687 --> 01:22:21.598
I want to be free.

01:22:22.607 --> 01:22:24.518
I want to be...

01:22:25.327 --> 01:22:26.726
new,

01:22:26.767 --> 01:22:28.439
clean.

01:22:28.487 --> 01:22:30.876
I want to be good.

01:22:33.887 --> 01:22:35.161
Please.

01:22:35.207 --> 01:22:37.437
Please, you have to help me.

01:22:38.847 --> 01:22:40.758
If we repent,

01:22:40.807 --> 01:22:43.002
God is faithful and just.

01:22:45.447 --> 01:22:47.358
Confess your mortal sins.

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:54.842
- Confess your mortal...
- This is not my true face!

01:22:58.887 --> 01:23:01.321
If you could see my soul...

01:23:01.367 --> 01:23:04.598
Child, only God may see our souls.

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:07.241
I have seen my soul!

01:23:09.687 --> 01:23:11.598
And I could show it to you.

01:23:12.807 --> 01:23:14.718
It's rotten.

01:23:16.607 --> 01:23:18.518
It stinks.

01:23:20.127 --> 01:23:22.163
It's poison.

01:23:25.247 --> 01:23:27.317
Help me.

01:24:44.487 --> 01:24:46.045
You will die.

01:25:26.127 --> 01:25:27.685
I'm sorry.

01:25:49.287 --> 01:25:50.720
Mr Gray?

01:25:54.127 --> 01:25:56.118
Miss Wotton.

01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:02.724
Please forgive my intrusion at this late hour.

01:26:09.887 --> 01:26:11.798
You're shaking.

01:26:12.847 --> 01:26:15.805
- Look, come and sit by the fire.
- I want to tell you...

01:26:16.687 --> 01:26:18.996
I want to tell you...
I want to tell you everything.

01:26:20.607 --> 01:26:22.040
All right. Look at me.

01:26:22.087 --> 01:26:23.998
Sh! What is it?

01:26:24.047 --> 01:26:25.958
I need you...

01:26:26.007 --> 01:26:28.282
I need you to know...

01:26:28.327 --> 01:26:31.285
- what I am.
- Sh!

01:26:31.327 --> 01:26:33.602
It's all right. Listen, sh...

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.638
It's all right.

01:26:35.687 --> 01:26:37.598
Sh...

01:27:19.247 --> 01:27:20.965
Harry.

01:27:36.847 --> 01:27:38.200
Morning.

01:27:38.247 --> 01:27:40.158
Sleep well?

01:27:42.047 --> 01:27:45.119
Mr Gray was in need of a friend.

01:27:45.167 --> 01:27:46.361
Mmm.

01:27:47.407 --> 01:27:50.922
Perhaps you could ask Mrs Williams
to prepare me some breakfast?

01:27:52.447 --> 01:27:53.926
Of course.

01:27:57.607 --> 01:28:00.485
- So young.

01:28:03.367 --> 01:28:05.278
The world is hers.

01:28:07.447 --> 01:28:09.915
- Harry, I...
- How dare you!

01:28:11.847 --> 01:28:14.839
- She's my daughter.
- I've changed.

01:28:16.167 --> 01:28:18.078
You've changed?

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:21.118
But you don't change, do you, Dorian?

01:28:24.367 --> 01:28:26.278
Why is that?

01:28:30.007 --> 01:28:31.918
Harry, you're my oldest friend...

01:28:31.967 --> 01:28:34.276
You're against nature.
You stay away from her.

01:28:34.327 --> 01:28:37.046
- I don't want this to get...
- Stay away from her!

01:28:54.567 --> 01:28:56.558
Mr Gray!

01:28:59.007 --> 01:29:01.157
I should apologise for my father.

01:29:05.927 --> 01:29:08.600
Last night, you wanted to tell me something.

01:29:12.127 --> 01:29:14.800
- Dorian!
- I want to begin again.

01:29:18.567 --> 01:29:21.559
Far away from everything here.

01:29:23.807 --> 01:29:25.365
I see. Well, I wouldn't...

01:29:25.407 --> 01:29:27.318
Everything except you.

01:29:41.287 --> 01:29:43.198
Dorian!

01:30:06.847 --> 01:30:07.996
Yes.

01:30:15.887 --> 01:30:17.923
<i>Are you sure this is what you want?</i>

01:30:21.607 --> 01:30:23.518
You're what I want.

01:30:35.407 --> 01:30:39.002
As I recall, Mr Gray stored it in the attic.

01:30:39.047 --> 01:30:41.402
He certainly wanted to protect it.

01:30:48.367 --> 01:30:50.927
What secrets does he unlock?

01:30:54.647 --> 01:30:56.797
Nobody at all need know.

01:31:36.047 --> 01:31:37.560
Emily!

01:31:37.607 --> 01:31:38.835
Emily!

01:31:40.927 --> 01:31:43.566
- What's the meaning of this?
- I'm sorry...

01:31:43.607 --> 01:31:45.882
Don't come up here.

01:31:47.367 --> 01:31:48.561
Please.

01:31:50.287 --> 01:31:51.481
Never.

01:31:56.407 --> 01:31:58.523
Give me the key, please, Emily.

01:32:00.127 --> 01:32:02.595
- Well, what's in there?
- Give me the key!

01:32:04.087 --> 01:32:05.679
What's in there?

01:32:05.727 --> 01:32:07.160
Please.

01:32:08.927 --> 01:32:10.804
I beg you.

01:32:46.367 --> 01:32:49.484
<i>It's imperative it sails with us.
To New York, yes.</i>

01:32:50.767 --> 01:32:54.396
I shall wrap it myself, but I'd be grateful
if you'd send men to help carry it down.

01:32:54.447 --> 01:32:55.766
Thank you.

01:32:58.647 --> 01:33:01.161
The house should fetch a fine price, Mr Gray.

01:33:02.367 --> 01:33:05.245
Will you be leaving any of the furnishings?

01:33:06.167 --> 01:33:08.078
All of them.

01:33:11.727 --> 01:33:14.036
You know, I think that he wants
to make amends.

01:33:15.327 --> 01:33:17.238
We owe him the benefit of the doubt.

01:33:20.367 --> 01:33:23.518
I couldn't let you go off to that
ghastly continent without a farewell.

01:33:28.687 --> 01:33:29.836
Come.

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:33.878
- I hear you sail at dawn?

01:33:33.927 --> 01:33:36.395
How romantic.

01:33:36.447 --> 01:33:39.405
- Oh, to be young again.
Easily done.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:41.756
Can you recall any errors
you made in your early days?

01:33:41.807 --> 01:33:44.765
Very many, with much clarity.

01:33:44.807 --> 01:33:46.877
Then commit them over again.

01:33:46.927 --> 01:33:49.521
To get back one's youth,
one merely has to repeat one's follies.

01:33:49.567 --> 01:33:52.639
- Or you could barter your soul.

01:33:59.807 --> 01:34:01.718
Darling, are you all right?

01:34:02.647 --> 01:34:04.080
Clumsy.

01:34:05.407 --> 01:34:07.318
Sorry, excuse me, will you?

01:34:36.407 --> 01:34:38.318
Sorry, darling, have you seen Harry?

01:34:38.367 --> 01:34:41.484
No. But look. Look what he dug out.

01:34:41.527 --> 01:34:43.961
You never told me
there was a painting of you.

01:34:44.887 --> 01:34:46.878
Where is it?

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:54.998
The war's this way, mate!

01:35:26.127 --> 01:35:27.640
Harry.

01:35:29.567 --> 01:35:31.842
I want to see it.

01:35:31.887 --> 01:35:33.798
See what?

01:35:33.847 --> 01:35:37.317
- Basil's picture.
- The picture was destroyed years ago.

01:35:39.167 --> 01:35:40.725
I never liked it.

01:35:42.687 --> 01:35:44.484
Show me.

01:35:46.687 --> 01:35:48.757
It's an old portrait of my grandfather.

01:35:52.007 --> 01:35:53.645
Show me.

01:35:55.167 --> 01:35:57.078
Would you really kill me, Harry?

01:35:58.207 --> 01:36:00.801
You taught me
that a man can rule his emotions.

01:36:02.367 --> 01:36:03.800
But I can't.

01:36:05.327 --> 01:36:09.240
I can't help loving your daughter more
than I've loved anything in my life.

01:36:11.127 --> 01:36:14.642
And I can't help how dear
I still hold our friendship.

01:36:16.127 --> 01:36:17.321
Please...

01:36:18.927 --> 01:36:20.485
Please don't do this.

01:36:25.727 --> 01:36:28.480
Just old trinkets, Harry.
Why don't we go back to the party?

01:36:36.727 --> 01:36:38.683
Basil...

01:36:42.167 --> 01:36:43.680
Harry...

01:36:51.567 --> 01:36:53.285
What are you?

01:36:53.327 --> 01:36:55.124
I am what you made me!

01:36:55.167 --> 01:37:00.002
I lived the life that you preached
but never dared practise.

01:37:01.127 --> 01:37:04.676
I am everything
that you were too afraid to be.

01:37:08.807 --> 01:37:10.718
But I was trying...

01:37:12.807 --> 01:37:15.685
I was trying so hard...

01:37:16.607 --> 01:37:18.643
...to be a better man.

01:37:20.567 --> 01:37:22.637
I'm sorry.

01:37:37.207 --> 01:37:39.596
Kelso was right.

01:37:39.647 --> 01:37:42.036
You are... You're death.

01:37:44.207 --> 01:37:45.560
Dorian?

01:37:46.047 --> 01:37:47.799
Dorian!

01:37:59.647 --> 01:38:01.285
Harry, no!

01:38:27.327 --> 01:38:29.443
- No!

01:38:33.447 --> 01:38:35.358
Aaaargh!

01:38:51.727 --> 01:38:53.126
No! Come with me!

01:38:53.167 --> 01:38:54.885
What are you doing? Where's Dorian?

01:38:54.967 --> 01:38:56.195
Dorian?

01:38:56.247 --> 01:38:58.158
- Locked.

01:38:59.127 --> 01:39:01.687
- Emily! No, leave him!
- No! No!

01:39:01.727 --> 01:39:03.922
- No! Dorian...

01:39:05.407 --> 01:39:07.125
Give me the key.

01:39:07.167 --> 01:39:09.727
Look, give me the key!

01:39:13.847 --> 01:39:15.758
What's in there?

01:39:16.847 --> 01:39:18.519
What's in there?

01:39:21.167 --> 01:39:23.158
You have my whole heart, Emily.

01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:25.163
Leave him!

01:39:26.367 --> 01:39:28.198
My whole heart.

01:39:28.247 --> 01:39:29.999
What?

01:39:30.887 --> 01:39:33.401
Emily, I beg you...

01:39:37.327 --> 01:39:38.316
No...

01:39:38.367 --> 01:39:39.720
Dorian!

01:39:40.647 --> 01:39:41.716
Dorian!

01:39:44.927 --> 01:39:46.280
No! Dorian!

01:39:46.327 --> 01:39:47.282
Dorian!

01:39:56.247 --> 01:39:58.158
Aaaargh!

01:40:08.927 --> 01:40:10.883
Raaargh!

01:40:22.367 --> 01:40:24.358
Aaaaaargh!

01:40:42.047 --> 01:40:43.958
I'm still her father, Agatha.

01:40:44.847 --> 01:40:47.202
And I'm merely asking that you tell her...

01:40:50.007 --> 01:40:51.918
...that I miss her

01:40:51.967 --> 01:40:54.037
and that this will always be her home.

01:40:56.687 --> 01:40:58.917
And maybe one day she'll want to listen.

01:41:34.887 --> 01:41:36.798
Poor boy.

01:41:37.447 --> 01:41:40.086
Who can bear to look at you now?

01:41:41.305 --> 01:41:47.227
