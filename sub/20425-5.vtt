00:00.283 --> 00:02.163
<i>Previously on "Famous in Love.."</i>

00:02.187 --> 00:03.377
That's me asking you out.

00:03.378 --> 00:05.712
I'm sorry. I, I
can't accept this.

00:05.713 --> 00:07.673
I mean, you said it
yourself he's a player.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.299
No. I'm not gonna
let him use me.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.676
- Give me another chance?
- No.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.845
- Not, like, right now.
- Alan Mills?

00:13.846 --> 00:16.265
I'm the new head of
Gold Brothers, Nina.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.267
Set PA Adam at your service.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.936
I'll see you around, PA Adam.

00:20.937 --> 00:23.105
We're two adults. Nothing
wrong with what we're doing.

00:23.106 --> 00:24.606
It's a little bit wrong.

00:24.607 --> 00:27.234
Alexis is going to help me
and she told me everything.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.378
Why didn't you tell me when
she called the first time?

00:29.379 --> 00:30.737
- I'm sorry.
- Stick with me.

00:30.738 --> 00:32.656
I can teach you all
kinds of things.

00:32.656 --> 00:34.408
Alexis isn't sick.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.202
'She's in Palm
Springs with Jake.'

00:37.203 --> 00:38.245
Take your money and
get out of here.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.454
'If you ever bother him again'

00:39.455 --> 00:41.164
you'll be dealing with me.

00:41.165 --> 00:42.291
That's not mine!

00:42.292 --> 00:44.126
- Step out of the car.
- That's not mine.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.127
'You've the right
to remain silent.'

00:45.128 --> 00:47.045
- I'm cool with you and Tangey.
- Huh?

00:47.046 --> 00:48.989
If there's somethin' there,
you should go for it.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.453
I've been working
on some new music.

00:50.454 --> 00:53.051
- That's a no, young lady.
- 'And cut!'

00:53.052 --> 00:54.803
'Uh, that's a cut, guys.'

00:54.804 --> 00:57.055

of yours is over.</i>

00:57.056 --> 00:58.639

of working on my script?

01:23.249 --> 01:26.168
What? We need to take
the occasional break.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.629
- Occasional?
- So I like breaks.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.731

01:44.771 --> 01:47.898
It's been amazing having someone
like you, a real actress

01:47.899 --> 01:50.692
to work with me on all of it.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.361
I've been called a
lot of things before

01:52.362 --> 01:53.705
but I think that's
the first time

02:16.844 --> 02:18.929
I'm finishing that econ paper.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.764
I thought you missed
the deadline.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.016
I did, but it's half my grade

02:23.017 --> 02:25.018
so I'm turning it in, anyway.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.562
Well, you might be a
little delusional

02:26.563 --> 02:29.147
'cause Professor Hawkins is
a stickler for the rules.

02:29.148 --> 02:30.348
I'm gonna work all night at it

02:30.349 --> 02:31.725
to get it done
before the weekend.

02:31.726 --> 02:33.151
You're working on your birthday?

02:33.152 --> 02:34.903
- Uh, Paige, come on...
- Cassie.

02:34.904 --> 02:38.323
I'll never make it to 22 if I
flunk out and my dad kills me.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.492
Okay, well, hurry up because
I made reservations

02:40.493 --> 02:42.160
for your birthday
dinner tomorrow night.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.290
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.376
How was Palm Springs?

02:49.377 --> 02:52.295
I saw that you got a
lot of work done.

02:52.296 --> 02:54.339
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.550
Just, there's a lot
of tweets, so..

02:56.551 --> 02:58.468
What you were getting
accomplished.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.762
Oh, come on, you guys
are being childish.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.473
Jake, obviously it went
amazing with Alexis.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.857
We're just giving
you a hard time.

03:04.858 --> 03:06.143
Have fun, but keep in mind

03:06.144 --> 03:07.607
I don't give you
grief about Rainer.

03:07.608 --> 03:09.104
- Do I?
- Rainer? Why would you?

03:09.105 --> 03:11.273
He's my co-star. I'm
not sleeping with him.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.737
And for your sake,
I hope you don't.

03:12.738 --> 03:15.444
- Alexis said that...
- I don't care what Alexis said.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.321
I wouldn't believe a word
out of that girl's mouth.

03:18.322 --> 03:21.616
And FYI, she lied and told
production she was sick.

03:21.617 --> 03:24.453
Yeah, and of course, all of
her tweets were from bed.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.496
Okay, okay, I get it,
you two don't like her

03:26.497 --> 03:28.331
but she's actually helping me.

03:28.332 --> 03:29.995
Which is more than I
can say for you guys.

03:29.996 --> 03:32.294
Jake, hey.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.629
I really am sorry about
the phone-call thing.

03:34.630 --> 03:37.817
I would have never done that
if I knew it was work-related.

03:38.759 --> 03:41.219
Well, come on.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.763
Tomorrow's my 21st.

03:43.764 --> 03:47.118
Aren't we gonna do margaritas
like we always do?

03:48.311 --> 03:51.455
Come on, Jake. Don't
mess with tradition.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.711
I really don't wanna
fight with you.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.464
Neither do I.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.159
So I'll see you there
tomorrow night?

04:04.160 --> 04:06.470
Three <i>amigos</i> at Los Amigos.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.599
I'll be there.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.782
Come in.

04:30.144 --> 04:33.230
Hey, I've been lookin' for you.
Where have you been?

04:33.231 --> 04:34.940
Around. Now, this
week's been hectic.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.441
That new track I
dropped in "Conan"

04:36.442 --> 04:38.276
didn't exactly
make my mom happy.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.486
Yeah, well, I'm no country fan

04:39.487 --> 04:40.990
but you might have
just converted me.

04:40.991 --> 04:42.364
'Good for you to
stand up to her.'

04:42.365 --> 04:44.425
Oh, I did more than that.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.427
I fired her.

04:48.162 --> 04:51.581
Damn. Okay, so how
does that feel?

04:51.582 --> 04:54.334
Pretty good. I don't, I feel..

04:54.335 --> 04:55.836
I feel free.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.273
Like, like, I could
do whatever I want.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.385
You know, there's something
else I liked about that song.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.512
Oh, yeah?

05:05.513 --> 05:08.765
- What's that?
- It was about us, wasn't it?

05:08.766 --> 05:11.518
I mean, I wrote it on the
tour bus leaving Chicago.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.896
What are you doin'
after you wrap?

05:14.897 --> 05:16.022
Nothing.

05:16.023 --> 05:17.816
I got the beach house
to myself tonight.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.735
- You wanna drop by?
- Beach house?

05:20.736 --> 05:23.446
- What about Rainer?
- I spoke to Rainer. He's cool.

05:23.447 --> 05:25.907
Oh, so you two talk
it out, take a vote

05:25.908 --> 05:27.200
and now we can be together.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.535
No, no, it's not like that.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.245
What kind of say
do I get or do I?

05:30.246 --> 05:31.830
You two just decide
amongst yourselves

05:31.831 --> 05:34.207
which one I get to date.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.376
Okay, I get it.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.021
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry.

05:41.465 --> 05:42.817
Okay, then.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.238
So does that mean you'll
come out tonight?

05:48.556 --> 05:49.556
We'll see.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.618
Come in.

05:54.061 --> 05:56.313
Jordan, Wyatt wants
you at camera, buddy.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.040
Cool. I'll be right there.

06:02.194 --> 06:03.921
- See you.
- I hope so.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.869
Hey.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.334
Oh, how was your
scene this morning?

06:12.335 --> 06:13.913
Good. Wyatt seemed happy.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.461
Last night was nice,
uh, I was thinking

06:19.462 --> 06:22.005
maybe you wanna swing
by again tonight?

06:22.006 --> 06:24.507
Oh, I-I would, but I
have a workout scheduled

06:24.508 --> 06:25.842
with my trainer.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.706
You know the scenes I
have scheduled next week.

06:27.707 --> 06:29.721
I'm doin, like, half of
them with my shirt off.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.390
I need all the time with
my trainer I can get.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.493
- I'll rain check them.
- For sure.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.307
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.713
Whoa. Whoa. Stop, stop.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.341
Your timing is really off.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.551
You guys are not in sync
with each other at all.

07:08.552 --> 07:10.220
You make it look so easy, Twitch

07:10.221 --> 07:12.722
but clearly it's not.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.183
I get it. I've been
dancing since I was five.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.647
I have off days, too. Just let
me show you what it looks like.

07:17.648 --> 07:19.646
You just gotta relax
and have fun, okay?

07:37.331 --> 07:38.951
'I started on the wrong foot.'

07:48.134 --> 07:50.844
Hey. That's great.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.679
- So just do that?
- Just do that, alright?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.472
Um, now look, the thing
is, just have fun.

07:54.473 --> 07:57.434
I just don't know how we're gonna
learn this in three weeks.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.103
Three weeks? Try three days.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.730
- What?
- Three days?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.732
Oh, let me guess. You didn't
get the new schedule.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.567
Uh, no.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.231
Well, we had to move
it up for production.

08:07.232 --> 08:10.655
But w-why? We-we're
obviously not ready.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.241
- Get ready.
- Relax, Wyatt, we'll get it.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.368
Yeah, they know the
steps, they just..

08:15.369 --> 08:17.203
They gotta work on timing.
So they'll be okay.

08:17.204 --> 08:18.663
No, you're losing
your rehearsal space.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.748
Construction needs
to start building

08:19.749 --> 08:21.252
the Copacabana
Nightclub set in here.

08:21.253 --> 08:23.835
No problem. Paige, why don't you
come to my house tomorrow night?

08:23.836 --> 08:26.254
I have a huge living room.
We can rehearse there.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.215
- Uh, I can't tomorrow...
- 'She'd love to.'

08:29.216 --> 08:32.092
What? You're gonna tell me you
got something better to do?

08:32.094 --> 08:34.511
No, you don't because
you're gonna practice this

08:34.513 --> 08:37.575
night and day until the shoot.
Got it? Got it?

08:38.517 --> 08:39.618
Yeah.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.645
Don't worry. We'll get this.

08:42.645 --> 08:44.355
Hey, I'm surprised
at you, Rainer.

08:44.356 --> 08:46.917
You're usually really in sync
with your co-stars, man.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.487
When you dance.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.155
Uh, other dance scenes
that you had done.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.396
Can we go from the top, please?

08:53.397 --> 08:54.980
Pick off from the top.
You ready, dude?

Smiley-faced pancakes

10:01.975 --> 10:04.727
- Wow, you look like...
- Don't say it.

10:04.728 --> 10:07.062
I was up all night
finishing my paper.

10:07.063 --> 10:08.564
Finally, I get to
turn it in today.

10:08.565 --> 10:12.026
Sweet. Well, I have cleared my
schedule at the Pizza Dome.

10:12.027 --> 10:14.528
And we're gonna
rock this birthday.

10:14.529 --> 10:17.573
It's bottomless margaritas and
dollar shots at Los Amigos.

10:17.574 --> 10:19.077
- We're gonna get drunk.
- About that.

10:19.078 --> 10:20.471
I..

10:20.994 --> 10:22.745
Have to cancel.

10:22.746 --> 10:24.038
- What?
- Why?

10:24.039 --> 10:26.623
The film is making me
do dance rehearsal

10:26.624 --> 10:27.708
at Rainer's tonight.

10:27.709 --> 10:29.209
Tonight? Really?

10:29.210 --> 10:30.753
You have rehearsal
on your birthday?

10:30.754 --> 10:33.047
- Jake, it's work.
- You just don't get it.

10:33.048 --> 10:35.071
It's Rainer. He's just
tryin' to get in your pants.

10:35.072 --> 10:36.342
- That's all.
- Excuse me?

10:36.343 --> 10:38.344
Ten minutes ago you
were rolling around

10:38.345 --> 10:41.889
with Alexis the blow-up doll
in Palm Springs all weekend.

10:41.890 --> 10:44.242
Are you really acting
jealous right now?

10:45.101 --> 10:46.995
No. Actually, I'm leaving.

10:47.979 --> 10:49.813
Happy birthday, Paige.

10:51.066 --> 10:52.066
Oh.

10:53.651 --> 10:54.985
So let me get this straight.

10:54.986 --> 10:59.698
He just spent four days rolling
around in the sack with Alexis

10:59.699 --> 11:02.159
but I-I am being unreasonable

11:02.160 --> 11:04.012
when I actually
have to go to work?

11:08.705 --> 11:11.999
Yes, absolutely.
We will be there.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.561
Oh, and, uh, thank you, Adriana.

11:17.005 --> 11:19.090
- We're in business.
- What do you mean?

11:19.091 --> 11:21.217
Newcastle Studios flipped
over your script.

11:21.218 --> 11:22.676
Wait, wait. And who are they?

11:22.677 --> 11:24.958
They're the biggest funder of
indie projects in Hollywood.

11:24.959 --> 11:26.982
They won Sundance last year
with "Monument Valley."

11:26.983 --> 11:28.557
- I love that film!
- Good.

11:28.558 --> 11:30.643
You can tell the president
of Newcastle Studios that

11:30.644 --> 11:32.603
when you meet him
this afternoon.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.105
Am I really gonna
sell my script?

11:34.106 --> 11:36.208
I think so. Yeah.

11:36.733 --> 11:38.210
Thanks to you.

11:42.572 --> 11:44.674
Okay. I gotta get back to set.

11:50.956 --> 11:52.415
This just came via messenger.

11:52.416 --> 11:54.875
They said it was a rush. And
Jordan's here to see you.

11:54.876 --> 11:56.459
Thanks, Eva. I've been
waiting for that.

11:56.460 --> 11:58.395
Um, and send Jordan in.

12:00.382 --> 12:02.425
Hey, I've been calling
you all morning.

12:02.426 --> 12:04.427
- What's up?
- It's Brandy.

12:04.428 --> 12:07.447
She's in jail. Did
you know that?

12:08.223 --> 12:10.033
Actually, I didn't.

12:11.101 --> 12:12.726
But that is the perfect
place for her.

12:12.727 --> 12:14.979
'She won't be able to mess
with you from behind bars.'

12:14.980 --> 12:17.189
But jail? Really?

12:17.190 --> 12:19.150
She's my mom. What
am I supposed to do?

12:19.151 --> 12:21.569
Well, for starters, ignore that.

12:21.570 --> 12:24.488
'Look, I know there's a part
of you that feels bad for her'

12:24.489 --> 12:26.758
but she just extorted
money from you.

12:27.784 --> 12:29.886
She's never going to change.

12:31.163 --> 12:32.746
Trust me.

12:32.747 --> 12:35.124
Whatever happened to
land your mom in jail

12:35.125 --> 12:38.019
it was her own damn
fault, not yours.

12:40.130 --> 12:43.090
- I guess you're right.
- Look at it this way.

12:43.091 --> 12:46.510
Now no one will know that your
parents aren't really dead.

12:46.511 --> 12:47.553
I mean, think about it.

12:47.554 --> 12:49.346
Who's gonna believe the
word of a convict?

12:49.347 --> 12:52.349
The story we built
about who you are..

12:52.350 --> 12:54.077
Is finally safe.

12:57.647 --> 12:59.315
Thanks.

12:59.316 --> 13:01.233
I gotta go.

13:01.234 --> 13:04.170
Uh, hey, how'd your
workout go last night?

13:05.238 --> 13:06.489
It was good.

13:06.490 --> 13:08.407
I'll be ready for the
shirtless scene next week.

13:08.408 --> 13:09.509
Hm.

13:38.897 --> 13:41.148
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:41.149 --> 13:44.276
Wait, back it up. So
you're sleeping with him?

13:44.277 --> 13:46.237
Uh, well, I wasn't
planning on it

13:46.238 --> 13:48.405
but we were, we were out
there for four days

13:48.406 --> 13:50.282
and he's kinda cute, so..

13:50.283 --> 13:52.076
Lex, he's Paige
Townsen's roomie.

13:52.077 --> 13:53.244
They're like best friends.

13:53.245 --> 13:55.537
I know. Hey, I'm
gonna get a latte.

13:55.538 --> 13:57.241
- Do you have time?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

13:57.242 --> 13:59.250
I don't have to be back
at the studio until later

13:59.251 --> 14:01.460
to shoot that scene with Rainer.

14:01.461 --> 14:03.295
Um, two lattes, please.

14:03.296 --> 14:05.297
So be honest, are you
sleeping with him

14:05.298 --> 14:06.966
because you actually like him

14:06.967 --> 14:08.470
or because you wanna
mess with Paige?

14:08.471 --> 14:10.094
Okay, well, maybe it
started out that way

14:10.095 --> 14:12.096
but then we began
working together.

14:12.097 --> 14:14.890
Tange, his script
is really good.

14:14.891 --> 14:17.059
I'm even attaching
myself as a producer.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.643
Wait, seriously, why
are you doing that?

14:18.644 --> 14:20.771
Because I really believe in it.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.315
I'm tryin' to get it
set up somewhere.

14:22.316 --> 14:24.984
In fact, we have a big meeting
this afternoon at Newcastle.

14:24.985 --> 14:27.319
I have Jake rehearsing his
vision pitch right now.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.780
- Here you go.
- Hey, I'll get it.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.199
- Thanks.
- That sounds amazing.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.660
- I know you're gonna kill it.
- I hope so, too.

14:34.661 --> 14:37.162
This could be a chance for me to
control my own fate for once.

14:37.163 --> 14:38.330
Plus, if I'm the producer

14:38.331 --> 14:40.499
they can't give the
role to someone else.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.876
I'm sorry, this card's been declined.
You have another one?

14:42.877 --> 14:44.500
Uh, no, no, no. It's
a corporate account.

14:44.501 --> 14:46.255
Just try it again, please.

14:46.256 --> 14:48.340
'So tell me more
about this script.'

14:48.341 --> 14:50.050
Sorry, no go.

14:50.051 --> 14:51.945
- What?
- I got it.

14:52.429 --> 14:53.721
Thanks.

14:53.722 --> 14:56.199
- What the hell?
- Is everything okay?

14:57.267 --> 14:58.410
No.

15:02.314 --> 15:03.939
Tange, talk to me.

15:03.940 --> 15:07.293
Lex, my accounts are frozen. I
can't access any of my money.

15:12.381 --> 15:15.299

15:15.300 --> 15:18.469

15:36.863 --> 15:38.906
Check it. New deal, people.

15:42.077 --> 15:43.452
You want another take?

15:43.453 --> 15:45.596
I don't know. We-we seemed a
little off in that scene.

15:45.597 --> 15:46.914
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:46.915 --> 15:49.875
God, I feel like my mind is
a million miles away, but..

15:49.876 --> 15:51.502
- Well, I'm good. Do you..
- Okay.

15:51.503 --> 15:53.087
Well, as long as you're good.

15:53.088 --> 15:56.382
Hey, uh, Ray. Um..

15:56.383 --> 15:59.051
So..

15:59.052 --> 16:01.488
You're really cool
with Jordan and me?

16:04.391 --> 16:05.850
You bet.

16:05.851 --> 16:08.310
- Happy for you.
- Thank you for that.

16:08.311 --> 16:10.396
That really means a
lot because, Ray

16:10.397 --> 16:12.440
this is not just
some random hook-up.

16:12.441 --> 16:14.442
I know Jordan feels
the same way.

16:14.443 --> 16:16.002
I know he does.

16:27.311 --> 16:28.831
I'm just saying that
you need to show.

16:28.832 --> 16:31.000
'Even if it's late, you
can't miss her 21st.'

16:31.001 --> 16:32.293
She was there for yours.

16:32.294 --> 16:33.752
Look, I didn't start this fight.

16:33.753 --> 16:35.212
Actually, you kinda did.

16:35.213 --> 16:36.676
So you need to be
the one to end it.

16:36.677 --> 16:38.340
- 'Get over it, Jake!'
- So what?

16:38.341 --> 16:39.758
I, I'm supposed to
sit around all night

16:39.759 --> 16:41.319
while he's out in
Malibu hitting on her?

16:41.320 --> 16:43.143
- Is that it?
- 'That's not what's happening.'

16:43.144 --> 16:45.055
Jake, if you don't
show up tonight

16:45.056 --> 16:48.184
you could seriously
damage this friendship.

16:48.185 --> 16:49.935
Um, look, I have to
step into this meeting.

16:49.936 --> 16:52.229
Oh, so it's okay if
you have to work?

16:52.230 --> 16:53.522
They're ready for us. Come on.

16:53.523 --> 16:54.541
'But if she has to..'

16:56.318 --> 16:57.335
Put that away.

16:58.403 --> 17:01.155
Focus, Jake. We need this.

17:01.156 --> 17:02.459
Remember, they loved the script.

17:02.460 --> 17:05.939
Now we just need to make
them love you. Okay?

17:12.041 --> 17:13.560
Hey-hey, D.

17:15.127 --> 17:16.545
What did you do
with all my money?

17:16.546 --> 17:19.589
- Excuse me?
- My bank account is frozen.

17:19.590 --> 17:21.467
My credit cards were all declined.
Come on.

17:21.468 --> 17:23.469
This has your
fingerprints all over it.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.222
You have never managed
your own finances, Tange.

17:26.223 --> 17:28.307
- I'm looking out for you.
- No, don't do that.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.433
See, I know what you are doing.

17:29.434 --> 17:31.125
'You know I'm effectively
broke right now.'

17:31.126 --> 17:33.389
Well, maybe that was something
you should have thought of

17:33.390 --> 17:34.814
before you charged
off on your own.

17:34.815 --> 17:36.758
I take care of a lot of
things behind the scenes.

17:36.759 --> 17:40.152
That's what managers do.
We manage things.

17:40.153 --> 17:42.905
Maybe now you'll understand
why you need me.

17:42.906 --> 17:44.865
Ah, see, you're doing it again.

17:44.866 --> 17:47.701
- You're controlling me?
- I crafted your career.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.954
I made you a star.

17:49.955 --> 17:52.873
And that is something I'm just
not gonna let you toss away.

17:52.874 --> 17:56.460
Oh, mama, I'm gonna
sue you in court.

17:56.461 --> 17:59.522
And I will tie you up in
legal battles for years.

18:00.465 --> 18:02.567
Your career will be over.

18:05.303 --> 18:08.097
So I think it would be best

18:08.098 --> 18:10.641
if we keep our
professional arrangements

18:10.642 --> 18:12.535
just the way they are.

18:14.187 --> 18:15.997
Now, should we get back to work?

18:24.030 --> 18:26.991
- Hi. Professor Hawkins?
- 'Yes.'

18:26.992 --> 18:28.158
Uh, I'm Paige Townsen.

18:28.159 --> 18:30.411
I'm in your macro
economic theory class.

18:30.412 --> 18:32.580
What can I do for you?

18:32.581 --> 18:35.457
It's about my mid-term paper.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.793
That was due a week ago.
I never received it.

18:37.794 --> 18:40.254
Yes, I know it's overdue

18:40.255 --> 18:43.007
and that's bad and I'm late

18:43.008 --> 18:45.634
but you see, I-I have a
perfectly good reason.

18:45.635 --> 18:47.553
I just got cast in
this really big movie

18:47.554 --> 18:50.014
and I've been trying to
figure out a way to, you know

18:50.015 --> 18:51.640
balance everything out.

18:51.641 --> 18:55.144
I was hoping maybe you'd
take my paper late

18:55.145 --> 18:58.063
just, just this once.

18:58.064 --> 19:00.667
- Just this once?
- Yes. I promise.

19:01.484 --> 19:03.444
Ms. Townsen, do you think

19:03.445 --> 19:05.362
because you're
working on this film

19:05.363 --> 19:07.323
that I can grant you
special privileges

19:07.324 --> 19:09.408
I don't extend to
my other students?

19:09.409 --> 19:11.535
I, I see your point, but...

19:11.536 --> 19:15.039
Then you understand
that my answer is no.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.641
Sorry.

19:17.876 --> 19:21.462
- Anything else?
- Uh, no.

19:21.463 --> 19:23.189
Um, thank you.

19:25.216 --> 19:27.259
- 'Oh, Ms. Townsen?'
- Yes?

19:27.260 --> 19:29.112
You can take that with you.

19:46.058 --> 19:48.476
'So I know you connect
to the material.'

19:48.477 --> 19:51.646
You've also heard how I'd
approach the film tonally.

19:51.647 --> 19:54.827
And we all know we have the
perfect actress to play the lead.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.009
Now, I know I'm not an obvious
choice to direct this.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.903
Oh, you intend to direct?

20:02.038 --> 20:03.955
Oh, he-he was

20:03.956 --> 20:06.750
but he's not gonna stand in
the way of getting it made.

20:06.751 --> 20:08.978
But you should take
a look at his reel.

20:09.754 --> 20:13.465
Look, I know I'm green.

20:13.466 --> 20:15.383
Okay? I get that.

20:15.384 --> 20:17.636
But what excited me
about Newcastle Studios

20:17.637 --> 20:20.639
is you take chance on
new talent, new voices.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.974
What you really need to know

20:22.975 --> 20:25.143
is this is my story.

20:25.144 --> 20:26.871
It's intensely personal.

20:27.939 --> 20:29.856
'But just as Alexis said'

20:29.857 --> 20:32.251
I'm not gonna stand in the way
of getting this film made.

20:33.736 --> 20:36.756
Just look at my work.
That's all I ask.

20:42.870 --> 20:46.123
We'll deal with the directing
thing later, but your script..

20:46.124 --> 20:48.875
I want it. Nice job, kid.

20:48.876 --> 20:50.752
Thank you. Thank you so much.

20:50.753 --> 20:52.462
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

20:57.468 --> 20:59.487
- 'You okay?'
- Honestly?

21:01.055 --> 21:03.265
No. Oh.

21:03.266 --> 21:04.933
This has been the
worst birthday ever.

21:04.934 --> 21:06.726
Jake hates me

21:06.727 --> 21:09.479
Professor Hawkins
completely shut me down

21:09.480 --> 21:12.023
and I worked all day and
night on that paper.

21:12.024 --> 21:14.317
And now I have to spend
the rest of my night

21:14.318 --> 21:16.486
with Rainer "The Player" Devon.

21:16.487 --> 21:18.947
You should have seen the
way he was flirting

21:18.948 --> 21:21.283
with this girl today on set.

21:21.284 --> 21:24.035
I'm just so mad. Jake
was right about him.

21:24.036 --> 21:26.138
My whole day is ruined.

21:27.874 --> 21:29.916
We are not gonna
let that happen.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.540
There's nothing you
can even do about it.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.712
Yeah, there is. I'm comin'
to Rainer's with you.

21:33.713 --> 21:35.338
So you're gonna go
bring some fun clothes

21:35.339 --> 21:38.800
because I don't care how late
you rehearse, we're goin' out.

21:38.801 --> 21:40.218
We'll salvage this birthday

21:40.219 --> 21:42.846
even if we have to drink
warm beer out of a can

21:42.847 --> 21:44.598
a minute before midnight.

21:44.599 --> 21:46.117
You're the best.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.772
Thank you, Mr. Tanen. Thank you.

21:52.773 --> 21:53.857
No, no, call me Mike.

21:53.858 --> 21:55.317
I'm always happy
when I can discover

21:55.318 --> 21:57.777
exciting new talent.
You are impressive.

21:57.778 --> 22:00.739
I have high hopes for "No
Place Like you." Really.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.842
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm late for a dinner.

22:04.452 --> 22:07.871
We sold it in the room.

22:07.872 --> 22:09.831
Do you have any idea
how amazing that is?

22:09.832 --> 22:11.124
Come on, let's go celebrate.

22:11.125 --> 22:14.520
Um, I'm sorry, I can't.
I have to be somewhere.

22:16.339 --> 22:18.381

you enough, Alexis.

22:38.361 --> 22:40.779

rehearsing on your birthday.

22:40.780 --> 22:43.406
- Oh, yeah.
- You're ready?

22:43.407 --> 22:45.593
Yeah, let's get this done with.

22:46.494 --> 22:48.995
- Paige. There you are.
- Hey.

22:48.996 --> 22:51.373
- Let me take that.
- Oh, thank you.

22:51.374 --> 22:52.457
So I got everything set.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.001
I just need to change.
That's right.

22:55.002 --> 22:56.920
- You've never been out here.
- Uh-uh.

22:56.921 --> 22:58.713
Let me give you the grand tour.

22:58.714 --> 23:00.882
This is the living room
where we're gonna rehearse.

23:00.883 --> 23:01.925
'Let me get the lights.'

23:01.926 --> 23:04.904
Surprise!

23:07.640 --> 23:09.891
Happy birthday, Paige.

23:09.892 --> 23:12.811
What? You, you were in on this?

23:12.812 --> 23:15.814
Since about an hour ago, yeah.

'Cause right now she
sounds like the devil.

23:33.243 --> 23:34.791
Tell me about it.

23:34.792 --> 23:38.378
You know, the thing is I either
stay with her or I'm broke.

23:38.379 --> 23:39.754
Do something. Push back.

23:39.755 --> 23:42.007
That would mean lawyers, the
legal fees, years in court.

23:42.008 --> 23:44.009
I don't have the resources.

23:44.010 --> 23:47.012
If I even try and fight back,
I'll be left with nothing.

23:47.013 --> 23:48.864
Maybe nothing isn't
the worst thing.

23:49.682 --> 23:51.450
What do you mean?

23:53.019 --> 23:54.978
When I started out,
I was flat broke.

23:54.979 --> 23:57.897
Not a penny. I built
myself up from nothing.

23:57.898 --> 24:00.859
And now I'm stronger for it.

24:00.860 --> 24:03.236
Here's the thing.
You're Tangey Turner.

24:03.237 --> 24:04.740
You're immensely
talented, you've got

24:04.741 --> 24:07.115
a great future ahead of you.

24:07.116 --> 24:08.950
Do what you do and the
riches will come.

24:08.951 --> 24:11.036
Forget the money.

24:11.037 --> 24:13.305
Consider it a small price
to pay for your freedom.

24:14.957 --> 24:17.143
It'll be the best dollar
you've ever spent.

24:24.704 --> 24:26.384
When did this place
become so damn popular?

24:26.385 --> 24:28.261
Come on. It'll be fun.

24:28.262 --> 24:30.645
I thought that you said we're
gonna keep our thing on the DL

24:30.646 --> 24:32.682
you know, at least for now.

24:32.683 --> 24:34.893
What does that matter?
Come on, let's go.

24:34.894 --> 24:36.895
I don't want to.

24:36.896 --> 24:39.105
What? Is it me? You don't
wanna be seen with me?

24:39.106 --> 24:42.650
- No, that's not it.
- Wait. Is..

24:42.651 --> 24:44.986
Is there something you
wanna tell me right now?

24:44.987 --> 24:46.488
Nothing you need to worry about.

24:46.489 --> 24:48.198
Okay, good.

24:48.199 --> 24:50.622
You know, 'cause I'm done hiding
and sneaking around, Jordan.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.767
I am not going down
that road again.

24:55.247 --> 24:57.749
- 'It's Tangey Turner.'
- 'Hey, Tangey, here.'

24:57.750 --> 24:59.584
- Wait.
- Right here, right here.

25:04.465 --> 25:06.132
Go, man, just go.

25:21.148 --> 25:22.982
- Hey.
- Jake, change of plans.

25:22.983 --> 25:25.110
You need to get out to
Rainer Devon's house ASAP.

25:25.111 --> 25:27.695
What are you talking about?
Where are you?

25:27.696 --> 25:29.948
At Paige's insane
surprise party.

25:29.949 --> 25:32.742
You won't believe this place.
It's amazing.

25:32.743 --> 25:35.286
'Oh, and we were so
wrong about Rainer.'

25:35.287 --> 25:37.163
'You should see what
he's done for Paige.'

25:37.164 --> 25:38.331
- Are you kidding me?
- 'No.'

25:38.332 --> 25:40.750
I-I'm texting you the
address right now.

25:40.751 --> 25:42.919
Promise me you'll come.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.188
I-I gotta go.

25:59.085 --> 26:00.585
- Hi!
- Paige!

26:00.586 --> 26:02.975
Did it get you?
Were you surprised?

26:02.976 --> 26:04.768
I mean, you really got me, guys.

26:04.769 --> 26:06.812
I had no idea.

26:06.813 --> 26:09.398
So that means our dance number..

26:09.399 --> 26:12.026
Shoots as originally
scheduled, in three weeks.

26:12.027 --> 26:13.902
Ooh, thank goodness,
we have three weeks

26:13.903 --> 26:16.280
'cause Rainer and I, we
could really use the help.

26:16.281 --> 26:19.491
Well, Rainer actually knows the
steps forwards and backwards.

26:19.492 --> 26:21.160
I've been working
with him for years.

26:21.161 --> 26:23.996
- I can't believe you.
- I'm sorry.

26:23.997 --> 26:25.956
Look, but don't worry,
Paige, you'll be fine

26:25.957 --> 26:27.207
by the time we shoot.

26:27.208 --> 26:28.584
- Thank you.
- Hey, come on.

26:28.585 --> 26:31.086
There's someone else
I want you to meet.

26:31.087 --> 26:32.463
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

26:32.464 --> 26:34.131
Thanks, guys.

26:34.132 --> 26:36.342
This is Maddy, my party planner.

26:36.343 --> 26:38.927
She was instrumental in
pulling all this off.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.971
I saw you at the
studio yesterday.

26:40.972 --> 26:44.058
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you, too.

26:44.059 --> 26:45.059
He worked so hard on this

26:45.060 --> 26:47.436
I think he ran his
assistant, Vince, ragged.

26:47.437 --> 26:50.647
I could tell Rainer wanted
everything to be just right.

26:50.648 --> 26:52.149
It is. Thank you.

26:55.070 --> 26:58.238
- Can I borrow you for a sec?
- Sure, alright.

26:58.239 --> 27:00.133
Uh, I'll be right back.

27:03.328 --> 27:05.954
Ah. I feel like such an idiot.
I'm sorry.

27:05.955 --> 27:09.166
I was acting so crazy this morning.
I was such a mess.

27:09.167 --> 27:11.835
You're... you're amazing.

27:11.836 --> 27:14.004
Come here. Oh.

27:14.005 --> 27:16.590
You gotta admit.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.634
This is a little better
than Los Amigos.

27:18.635 --> 27:21.970
So it was all fake?

27:21.971 --> 27:25.724
The rehearsal, the rescheduling,
Wyatt yelling at me?

27:25.725 --> 27:29.103
Oh, my God. Jake? Was that fake, too?
Is-is he here?

27:29.104 --> 27:31.647
No, that was real

27:31.648 --> 27:34.149
but I called him and he
should be on his way.

27:34.150 --> 27:35.943
Okay. Good.

27:35.944 --> 27:37.694
Everybody, let's give it up

27:37.695 --> 27:40.739
for our birthday
girl, Paige Townsen.

27:40.740 --> 27:43.492
- Yeah.
- 'Whoo!'

27:43.493 --> 27:45.202
Let's get this party started!

27:54.838 --> 27:56.463
What are you saying then?

27:56.464 --> 27:58.566
I wanna try and make
things work with Tangey.

28:00.969 --> 28:03.929
- Does she know about us?
- No.

28:03.930 --> 28:06.157
I would never tell
anyone about us.

28:07.308 --> 28:10.060
Nina, you know how much
I care about you..

28:10.061 --> 28:12.747
But I just can't
keep doing this.

28:14.858 --> 28:17.025
Please.

28:17.026 --> 28:18.819
You've done so much
for me over the years

28:18.820 --> 28:21.071
I would never do anything
to intentionally hurt you.

28:21.072 --> 28:22.906
I'm just..

28:22.907 --> 28:24.133
I understand.

28:26.161 --> 28:28.120
Really?

28:28.121 --> 28:32.141
All I ever wanted was
what was best for you.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.019
You get that, right?

28:37.505 --> 28:39.774
You should do what makes
you happy, Jordan.

But we've spent every birthday
together since freshman year.

29:23.218 --> 29:24.843
Yeah, I really
thought he'd show.

29:28.097 --> 29:29.640
'Wow!'

29:30.934 --> 29:32.197
Rainer went to a lot of trouble

really special for you

29:34.520 --> 29:38.148

32:27.610 --> 32:29.069
I got your message.

32:29.070 --> 32:30.910
'Thank you for meeting
me here so late.'

32:30.911 --> 32:33.162
You could have just told me
what you wanted on the phone.

32:33.163 --> 32:36.284
I thought it would be
best if we met in person

32:36.285 --> 32:38.370
privately, without
our children around.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.478
Well, I think you'll have
to agree that our interests

32:44.479 --> 32:46.128
are really mutually
aligned here.

32:46.129 --> 32:48.130
You want control of
your daughter back.

32:48.131 --> 32:49.965
And what is it that
you want, Nina?

32:49.966 --> 32:51.758
Well, I want my son to be happy.

32:51.759 --> 32:54.219
Tangey cheated on
Rainer with Jordan

32:54.220 --> 32:55.595
his best friend.

32:55.596 --> 32:58.765
If Rainer doesn't have to be
reminded of that every day

32:58.766 --> 33:00.684
it would be better
for all of us.

33:00.685 --> 33:03.145
I agree, but I don't know what
it is you think you'll say

33:03.146 --> 33:05.856
to my headstrong daughter
to change her mind.

33:05.857 --> 33:07.482
Tangey's in love with that boy.

33:07.483 --> 33:09.443
How do you think she'd
feel if she found out

33:09.444 --> 33:11.712
Jordan had been lying
to her all these years?

33:12.864 --> 33:15.407
Jordan's mother's still alive.

33:15.408 --> 33:17.367

- So did you tell him yet?

'We have run over this
a thousand times. No.'

34:32.385 --> 34:35.804

His father just became
head of the studio.

34:58.494 --> 35:00.954
Why do you think I'm calling you?
I read "Deadline."

Kid Cudi was there.
He did karaoke.

36:52.483 --> 36:55.360
Thank you for giving me the bed.

36:55.361 --> 36:58.530
- How was the couch?
- Lumpy and uncomfortable.

36:58.531 --> 37:02.367
But it made me wake up early
and I got some fun waves.

37:02.368 --> 37:04.386
So I got that going for me.

37:05.579 --> 37:09.415
Uh, I'm sorry if you thought..

I know that's not

37:20.678 --> 37:22.363
Yeah. Fresh start.

37:23.848 --> 37:27.642
Look, I know I have this history

37:27.643 --> 37:29.894
and I know this world
is kinda crazy

37:29.895 --> 37:31.980
and really different

37:31.981 --> 37:34.524
from the one you're used to

37:34.525 --> 37:37.527
but what you have
to understand is

37:37.528 --> 37:41.548
for me... that
different is good.

37:43.534 --> 37:45.577
So forget about my history

37:45.578 --> 37:46.929
'cause when I'm with you..

37:47.997 --> 37:49.765
I wanna change.

37:52.418 --> 37:53.727
Really?

37:55.045 --> 37:56.188
Really.

38:00.467 --> 38:02.468
So what's for breakfast?

38:02.469 --> 38:04.971
Um, well

38:04.972 --> 38:07.432

recipe for baking soda

38:07.433 --> 38:10.393

gonna help you tell it.
