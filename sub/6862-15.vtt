WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:03.737
Those feelings I had for Lavon,
I still have them.

00:03.771 --> 00:05.439
Something already happened
between you two, hasn't it?

00:05.473 --> 00:07.341
Yes.
You were the
only person

00:07.375 --> 00:09.243
who knew how I really felt,

00:09.277 --> 00:10.344
and I don't think that
I can ever look at you

00:10.378 --> 00:11.412
the same way again.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.781
I'm sorry, Lavon, but whatever
this is, it has to end

00:13.814 --> 00:15.649
until I can win back
Lemon's trust.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.518
WADE:
 I'm just trying to spend
 some quality time with you.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.820
There's nothing wrong when
people appreciate your work.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.789
It's called career satisfaction
and you would

00:21.822 --> 00:22.790
understand that if you...

00:22.823 --> 00:24.125
That came out wrong.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.693
Plans for your bar?

00:25.726 --> 00:28.062
I think I might be ready
to give it another shot.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.335
(electric guitar playing
rock music)

00:53.287 --> 00:55.623
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.391
Yeah.

00:57.425 --> 00:58.559
You know, as your doctor,

00:58.592 --> 01:02.563
I'd have to say that is not
the safest way to travel.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.631
But as your girlfriend,

01:03.664 --> 01:06.134
guitarist in the back
of a truck, totally sexy.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.336
Well, we were rehearsing
in Meatball's garage last night

01:08.369 --> 01:09.503
till Meatball Sr. kicked us out.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.573
Spent the rest of the night
jamming on the open road.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.275
What? Bam.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.410
Nice, and when were you
planning on sleeping?

01:16.444 --> 01:17.811
Two days from now

01:17.845 --> 01:20.348
when we win the
Battle of the Bands in Fairhope.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.715
We'll sleep the
sleep of dudes

01:21.749 --> 01:23.451
who are $20,000 richer.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.418
Yeah, we will.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.420
When you
open your bar,

01:26.454 --> 01:27.721
I get a drink named after me.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.457
The Meatball.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.459
Yeah. Yeah, I could do that.
All right, buddy, it's yours.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.493
Take it easy, pal.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.861
Come here, beautiful.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.329
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.869
Oh, my goodness.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.903
Earth to AnnaBeth.

01:42.936 --> 01:43.904
I'm so sorry.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.905
It's okay.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.774
I, uh...

01:46.807 --> 01:48.876
(sighs) Hi.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.478
Okay, well, it's unavoidable.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.913
I kind of have to ask
about the tuxedo.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.516
Oh, yeah, it-it's
for a wedding.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.451
Huh?
Oh, not mine.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.320
Obviously.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.588
I am officiating.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.224
Just one of my many
mayoral duties.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.359
That's sweet.
Uh, who's the lucky couple?

02:05.393 --> 02:06.627
Couples, actually.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.630
Overseas, in the Marine Corp.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.864
See, I-I do proxy weddings.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.634
Two people here in BlueBell
stand in for a bride and groom

02:13.667 --> 02:16.870
overseas,
so they can be married legally.

02:16.904 --> 02:20.208
Wow, that is so romantic.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.842
Well, you know, not for me.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.477
You know, I-I
think I'm done

02:23.511 --> 02:25.379
in the romance department
for a while.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.548
So, you don't have to worry
about Lavon Hayes

02:27.581 --> 02:28.782
trying to win you back.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.851
(laughs)

02:35.656 --> 02:37.391
(Lemon laughing)

02:37.425 --> 02:39.327
Walt, you are such a hoot.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.628
Oh, you are sweet.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.896
And beautiful.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.865
And you are so good
at giving a compliment

02:44.898 --> 02:46.800
that I was thinking that maybe
you could spend

02:46.834 --> 02:48.502
the weekend with me here.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.971
My daddy's out
with his teenager

02:51.004 --> 02:52.440
and Magnolia's on a field trip.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.641
Oh, I wish I could, Lemon,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.943
but I've spent every night
with you for the past two weeks.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.346
And this weekend is my college
roommate's bachelor party.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.548
Oh, well, you can't miss that.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.250
Hi, Walt.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.717
Hi, Lemon.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.919
Oh, don't you look luminous.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.422
CRICKETT:
We missed you at the last two
Belle meetings.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.923
There was a mere crisis

03:09.957 --> 03:11.692
involving discretionary
snack cakes

03:11.725 --> 03:13.427
at the preservation committee.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.828
AnnaBeth totally
took care of it.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.929
She filled in for you.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.432
Yes, well, she's been doing
a lot of that lately.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.301
(feigns laugh)

03:20.334 --> 03:21.735
Enjoy the coffees.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.308
Looks like your
friends miss you, too.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.776
Oh. (chuckles)

03:28.809 --> 03:30.010
Come on, you shouldn't be alone.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.712
Have a girls' weekend
while I'm with the guys.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.717
You know what, you're so right.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.852
The stare, the icy
cold tone of voice.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.321
I'd know Lemon's
wrath anywhere.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.256
What did you do?

03:42.290 --> 03:43.657
Something stupid.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.959
I thought
it'd blow over by now.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.597
So, we keep running into her
and being nice until it does.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.565
Sooner or later, someone
else will offend her

03:51.599 --> 03:53.467
even worse and she'll
forget all about it.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.503
I would love to,
but she's avoiding me.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.670
Well, she can't
do that forever.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.871
Yeah, I know.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.440
In a town this size...

03:59.473 --> 04:00.641
No, I mean really.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.443
She can't do
that forever.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.744
Look.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.779
This tracks Lemon's location

04:05.813 --> 04:08.549
by her cell
phone signal.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.684
She had me set this
up when I got lost

04:10.718 --> 04:12.620
bringing her iced tea during
that Civil War reenactment.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.489
This way, we can
accidentally run into her.

04:15.523 --> 04:19.026
And make her see just exactly
what she's been missing.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.362
Meatball's lyrics may
seem simple at first,

04:21.394 --> 04:24.064
but like an onion, they're
many-layered underneath.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.633
Oh, yeah.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.635
Well, what have we here?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.036
What? I'm a
groupie now.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.704
Wow, well,

04:30.738 --> 04:32.573
I hope y'all are going to come
to the band practice later.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.907
Duh.
Um, yeah.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.409
Why not? Yeah.
Yeah.

04:35.443 --> 04:36.944
Awesome. All right,
I'll see you later.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.382
What is going on with you?

04:41.415 --> 04:42.950
I feel like I'm
cheating on my boyfriend

04:42.983 --> 04:45.553
with a super hot musician
that looks just like him.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.857
She's not my favorite person--

04:49.890 --> 04:51.325
or my second or third,

04:51.359 --> 04:53.661
she's really right near
the bottom of my list--

04:53.694 --> 04:56.397
but I almost feel bad
for Zoe right now.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.434
Musicians are like,
the sexiest drug in the world.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.971
Well, (clears throat) you know
that your-your

05:04.004 --> 05:06.640
current boyfriend has some
musical chops of his own.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.775
Oh, I know.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.743
I saw the photo of you in your
high school production

05:09.777 --> 05:10.844
of South Pacific.

05:10.878 --> 05:14.047
No, no, (stammers) I happen
to have played with Wade

05:14.081 --> 05:15.783
at BlueBellapalooza.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.086
Undergarments were thrown
in my direction.

05:19.119 --> 05:22.556
Sweetie, you don't have to try
to impress me.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.359
I now find lawyers
equally as sexy.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.394
I'll see you tonight.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.729
Uh... okay.
Okay, yeah, okay.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.701
Oh, Daddy, it was no problem.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.703
Everybody else was busy doing
other things,

05:35.736 --> 05:38.472
so I had time to stop by and
check on the house, so...

05:38.506 --> 05:40.608
Oh.

05:40.641 --> 05:44.077
Sure, yeah, um, okay, yeah,
you can-you can call me back

05:44.111 --> 05:45.813
after your dinner with Shelby.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.515
I'll just be here... (laughs)

05:47.548 --> 05:50.518
by myself.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.619
Okay.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.055
(sighs)

05:56.557 --> 05:57.625
(wood creaking)

05:57.658 --> 05:59.026
(gasps) Who's there?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.929
(creaking continues)

06:05.766 --> 06:07.835
(screaming)

06:07.868 --> 06:10.571
(music plays through headphones)
You scared me half to death.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.840
Magnolia,
what happened to your

06:12.873 --> 06:14.575
choral group trip to Jackson?

06:14.608 --> 06:17.411
Oh, well, you know how teacher's
always bluff

06:17.445 --> 06:19.179
that they'll turn the bus around
if some idiot

06:19.212 --> 06:20.648
doesn't stop fooling around?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.651
Wasn't bluffing this time.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.619
Yay, this is fantastic.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.022
You're not even going to ask
if I was the idiot?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.459
No.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.460
We are going
to have a sister weekend.

06:32.493 --> 06:35.663
Are you ready for 48
hours of inseparable fun?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.598
Yay.
Yay.

06:37.631 --> 06:41.401
(rock intro playing)

06:43.070 --> 06:44.905
Sorry, I'm late.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.540
Sergeant Jeffries' elbow
was acting up again.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.541
What'd I miss you?

06:47.575 --> 06:49.810
(chuckling):
Just you wait.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.645
* My body's in the car

06:51.679 --> 06:53.614
* My heart is getting gas

06:53.647 --> 06:56.149
* You tell me that you love me

06:56.183 --> 06:57.951
* Then you light a match

06:57.985 --> 06:59.520
* Burning in your madness

06:59.553 --> 07:01.755
* The pedal's to the floor

07:01.789 --> 07:03.624
* Flames are ripping
through me *

07:03.657 --> 07:06.827
* And I can't take no more.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.762
*

07:11.565 --> 07:13.801
Am I wrong
or is this really...

07:13.834 --> 07:15.736
Uh-huh.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.007
(song ends)
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.609
Thank you, BlueBell.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.110
Yeah, yeah.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.245
GEORGE:
Wade, that was-that
was so awesome.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.780
Man, that was so good.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.649
But we do have to go now.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.718
Uh, because I
promised Tansy

07:30.751 --> 07:33.086
that I was gonna
fix her shower.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.756
But you, you keep
on rocking man.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.824
All right, rock on, buddy.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.191
Yeah.
Yeah, buddy.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.493
Hi.
Hey, what'd you think?

07:39.527 --> 07:40.994
Hmm? (laughs)

07:41.028 --> 07:42.730
What'd I tell you, right?
We're amazing, aren't we?

07:42.763 --> 07:43.864
I think you're ready
for a little

07:43.897 --> 07:44.998
"Nightmare Demon Lullaby."

07:45.032 --> 07:46.667
Uh-oh, here it comes.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.201
One, two, three, four.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.038
(heavy metal intro plays)

07:51.071 --> 07:53.907
* Nightmare demon lullaby

07:56.777 --> 07:59.880
* Grim Reaper comes, I said
a nightmare demon lullaby *

07:59.913 --> 08:02.550
* Oh, oh, oh, why, why?

08:04.652 --> 08:06.253
* Why?
(mouthing)

08:17.798 --> 08:20.100
So, I have gone over it
in my head,

08:20.133 --> 08:23.737
and our only option is
to kidnap Meatball.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.773
Keep him somewhere
isolated, yet comfortable,

08:25.806 --> 08:27.675
until Battle of
the Bands is over.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.010
Okay, I-I think we need to
settle down, all right, cowgirl?

08:30.043 --> 08:31.845
Maybe it's not as bad
as we thought.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.047
All right, we didn't like it,
but Tansy seemed

08:34.081 --> 08:35.749
to really love it, so...

08:35.783 --> 08:37.083
Okay, Mind Face is never going
to win a contest

08:37.116 --> 08:38.251
based on the audiences' votes,

08:38.284 --> 08:40.120
all right, 'cause Meatball,
his voice,

08:40.153 --> 08:42.856
he sounds like a werewolf stuck
in a garbage disposal.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.626
And Mind Face-- what
does-what does that even mean?

08:45.659 --> 08:49.697
Does it mean, like, the melding
of the brain and the face?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.999
I thought-I though it meant,
like, mind the face.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.301
Got to watch the face.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.837
Mind Face! Mind Face!

08:56.870 --> 08:59.039
No, it is,
it's a confounding name.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.240
But the point of the matter is,

09:00.273 --> 09:02.275
we cannot say anything to Wade.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.646
He's way too excited about this,
all right?

09:05.679 --> 09:06.747
For now.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.915
But what happens when he loses,

09:07.948 --> 09:09.216
and we didn't do anything
to help him?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.250
That is our fault.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.119
Our fault?
Yes.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.221
No.
Yes.
No.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.990
Opening that bar
is his life dream, okay?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.225
We have to tell him.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.660
(sighs)

09:19.693 --> 09:22.195
Listen, Zoe, he's too invested,
okay?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.230
You know the man,

09:23.263 --> 09:25.666
he is not even going
to hear you.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.801
(sighs) You're right.

09:27.835 --> 09:30.570
That's why it can't
come from me.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.677
Do you take Matthew by proxy
to be your

09:36.710 --> 09:37.745
lawfully wedded husband?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.346
I do.

09:39.379 --> 09:43.083
Do you take Kimberly by proxy to
be your lawfully wedded wife?

09:43.116 --> 09:45.853
I sure do.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.220
Now,
by the power vested in me,

09:47.254 --> 09:48.856
I pronounce
Matthew Scott Jackson

09:48.889 --> 09:50.357
and Kimberly Trang Tran

09:50.390 --> 09:51.859
husband and wife.

09:51.892 --> 09:55.028
May I now kiss
my proxy bride?

09:55.062 --> 09:57.130
You may.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.973
(clears throat)
Okay, break it up.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.908
We all got places to be.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.977
I've got to run, I'm
going to be late for work.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.612
Oh, come with me,
I'll turn on the siren.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.650
Lavon, that was so romantic.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.719
I always knew
I wanted to marry Wanda,

10:18.752 --> 10:21.855
but looking into her eyes
and saying those words

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
made me realize
I want to marry her now.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.194
Good luck with that,
I hope it works out for you.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.395
What? No.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.130
You have to
help me plan it.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.999
Tom, Wanda loves you.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.867
Just get down on one knee
and ask her to marry you.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.335
One knee won't cut it.

10:35.368 --> 10:40.040
Wanda makes me feel
big, epic things.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.176
(laughs) I know, I'm a Hallmark
card, I can't help it.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.180
Eh, Wanda does
deserve something nice.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.882
Which is why I need your help.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.884
Your proposal at Christmas
was so perfect

10:50.918 --> 10:53.086
and detailed
and beautiful.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.222
Up until the point where she...

10:55.255 --> 10:56.890
Mm-hmm.

10:56.924 --> 10:57.958
Well, you know.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.129
Uh, please, Lavon,

11:02.162 --> 11:03.363
for Wanda...

11:03.396 --> 11:04.765
for love.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.401
Fine.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.403
Yeah. Okay, I was thinking

11:10.437 --> 11:13.907
we could do something
with Ewoks and Avatars.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.043
Uh, no.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.478
How about this one?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.147
Not a chance.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.782
When you said
you'd take me shopping,

11:21.815 --> 11:24.051
I thought that we were using
the definition of shopping

11:24.084 --> 11:25.919
that the rest of the world uses,

11:25.953 --> 11:27.788
and that you would
buy me something.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.923
Well, that's because you only
want the dresses

11:29.957 --> 11:31.959
that look like they belong
on Rihanna's backup dancers.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.026
(door opens, bell jingles)

11:33.060 --> 11:35.763
Lemon! How funny
seeing you here!

11:35.796 --> 11:39.499
Oh, hey, so Crickett and I were
just heading

11:39.532 --> 11:40.467
to Susie's for some pedis.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.903
Maybe you and Magnolia would
like to join us.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.807
It would give us a chance
to catch up, really talk.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.409
Nope. Uh, we're nowhere near
finished shopping yet.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.278
I am.
Oh, really?

11:51.311 --> 11:54.748
I thought you wanted
to try this on.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.850
Sorry, ladies.
Maybe next time.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.225
(knocking)

12:05.258 --> 12:06.459
Hey, babe!

12:06.493 --> 12:08.095
Hey, what's up?

12:08.128 --> 12:09.229
I ran into George
in town

12:09.262 --> 12:11.098
and he has a
little problem.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.133
Maybe you can help
him with it.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.401
It's kind of
sensitive, though.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.136
Ooh, something sexual?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.238
If it's got
to do with Tansy,

12:18.271 --> 12:21.241
the best bet: Ace bandages,
a lot of ice.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.877
GEORGE:
No, no, it's not that.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.145
Um, I know that you're all set

12:25.178 --> 12:28.115
to have Meatball play with you
tomorrow night.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.518
Who, by the way,
he's a, he's a huge talent.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.221
But I was wondering
if you might consider

12:34.254 --> 12:35.989
letting me replace him
just for one night.

12:36.023 --> 12:39.893
What? Why?

12:39.927 --> 12:45.098
Well, because I have been
feeling very down lately.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.301
It's just 'cause I don't
have anything artistic

12:48.335 --> 12:50.537
in my life right
now, you know?

12:50.570 --> 12:53.273
And the last time I felt
like I really did was,

12:53.306 --> 12:56.143
well, the last time
that you and I

12:56.176 --> 12:57.410
played together
at BlueBellapalooza.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.112
(gasps) Oh.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.149
Well, I hate to tell you this,
George,

13:02.182 --> 13:04.885
but I think you're talking
to the wrong guy.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.554
You should ask the good
Dr. Hart here

13:07.587 --> 13:10.390
for a suggestion on a shrink.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.959
ZOE:
I thought
the two buddies jamming

13:11.992 --> 13:14.862
on stage, there is no better
therapy than that.

13:14.895 --> 13:15.829
Mm-mm.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.530
And you don't have to worry
about winning,

13:17.564 --> 13:19.032
because you guys?
Awesome together.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.600
Everyone said so.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.537
Hmm. Well, as tempting as this
charitable act sounds,

13:24.571 --> 13:27.174
I think I'm going to have
to take a rain check

13:27.207 --> 13:28.408
on the reunion tour.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.844
Oh.
Gotta dance with the girl
you brung.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.212
Not always you don't.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.246
No hard feelings?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.982
No. No, none at
all, actually.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.616
No.
Yeah, And so best
of luck tomorrow night.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.485
And, uh,

13:38.518 --> 13:40.320
take it easy.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.089
(door opens, closes)

13:42.122 --> 13:43.356
What was that about?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.458
Okay, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you this before,

13:45.492 --> 13:47.294
but I was trying to
protect your feelings.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.429
And you're not gonna
want to hear this,

13:49.462 --> 13:51.364
but I don't think
Meatball is great.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.934
I think that he stinks,
sometimes literally,

13:53.967 --> 13:54.935
but mostly vocally.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.170
(laughs)
Is that what this
whole show is about?

13:57.204 --> 14:01.141
You and Tucker and
the "search for an
artistic outlet."

14:01.174 --> 14:03.443
Man, that was really good.
It was very moving.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.012
I am trying to help you.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.514
I think that you are making
a mistake with Meatball.

14:07.547 --> 14:12.352
You just don't get Meatball's
very particular artistic flavor.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.955
Oh, yeah, that's because
it sounds like

14:14.988 --> 14:17.224
Meatball's got one stuck
in his throat!

14:17.257 --> 14:19.559
You who thought Waylon Jennings
was a band comprised of brothers

14:19.592 --> 14:21.061
named Jennings
who liked to wail.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.329
I can't be
the only one

14:22.362 --> 14:23.663
that ever thought that.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.332
It's not a big deal,
all right?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.533
Everybody's got their strengths.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.468
It just so happens, you don't
know anything about music.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.636
It's fine, all right?

14:29.669 --> 14:31.371
That's why
I'm the one in the band.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.205
No, but I do.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.141
Look, don't worry
about it, all right?

14:34.174 --> 14:37.110
I'll worry about it.
Let me do the worrying.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.146
You want a beer?
What you want?

14:49.722 --> 14:51.391
Ooh, bummer.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.326
I'm just finishing off
the last of the eggs now,

14:53.360 --> 14:54.928
the pancakes
and some leftovers,

14:54.962 --> 15:00.433
which may or may
not have been
tuna casserole.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.402
So, I've been doing
some thinking,

15:02.435 --> 15:05.172
and maybe I was quick
to pass judgment

15:05.205 --> 15:07.540
and wasn't being
supportive enough.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.144
Well, that is mighty big
of you, Doc.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.480
I think you should call
Lily Anne Lonergan

15:13.513 --> 15:14.681
and reunite the old band.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.616
After all, I'm the reason

15:16.649 --> 15:18.318
that you're not playing
with her tonight.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.288
Just so I understand this,

15:21.321 --> 15:23.290
you want me to fire Meatball

15:23.323 --> 15:25.692
and hire Lily Anne,
who made a pass at me

15:25.725 --> 15:27.294
the last time I saw her?

15:27.327 --> 15:29.963
One little pass.
You know, it happens.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.966
Seriously? You think Mind Face
is that bad?

15:33.000 --> 15:37.504
I just, I think the audience
might not hear what you hear.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.638
And the whole point is

15:38.671 --> 15:40.974
to win, right?
I mean, that's what
you really want.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.409
No, what I want, Zoe,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.677
is a girlfriend
who's supportive of me.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.713
And that means
saying you like my band

15:46.746 --> 15:48.181
even though
clearly you don't!

15:48.215 --> 15:50.083
Wait.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.286
(sighs)

15:53.320 --> 15:54.587
(door slams shut)

15:54.621 --> 15:55.955
(sighs)

15:59.492 --> 16:01.061
What's up?
I got your message.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.163
I got your proposal
for you.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.033
I knew you'd do it!
So, what is it?

16:06.066 --> 16:09.069
Picture this. I tell Wanda
you're in the town square

16:09.102 --> 16:12.005
where you're standing next
to a horse-drawn carriage.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.374
You tell her that your love
for her is timeless,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.743
and that you would be honored
to have her hand in marriage.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.446
There's only one
problem with that.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.482
I'm afraid of horses.
Like, very afraid.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.617
So? You're not gonna be
riding them,

16:24.651 --> 16:26.353
you're gonna be driving them,
like a car.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.322
Yeah, yeah, like a car
with four legs.
Yeah.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.124
And beady eyes that ravage
your soul.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.293
Look, what better way to show
your commitment

16:33.326 --> 16:36.029
than to stare fear
straight in the face?

16:36.063 --> 16:39.066
Love is risky, Tom.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.368
But the risk is worth it.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.203
Beady eyes and all.

16:45.272 --> 16:48.375
LEMON:
I thought we put
these boots back.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.578
I had her ring them up
when you weren't looking.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.746
Well, I guess
there's a fine line

16:53.780 --> 16:55.682
between deceit and initiative.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.717
Hey, you know what
best friends do?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.086
They go to concerts.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.388
And I heard that Wade Kinsella's
performing

17:01.421 --> 17:03.656
at the Battle of the Bands
tonight. Can we go?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.657
I don't think so.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.395
Then, no offense, I just
think sisters' weekend

17:08.428 --> 17:10.163
might have to be
over for tonight.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.133
Tina's having friends over,
and I'll just...

17:13.165 --> 17:14.534
But, um, there's still so much
fun to be had.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.569
I was thinking that we could get
our hair done.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.173
Can I get purple streaks
in my hair?

17:22.775 --> 17:24.844
Um, I guess so.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.380
And you can do yours, too.
(gasps)

17:27.414 --> 17:30.283
Purple streaks?

17:30.317 --> 17:33.653
* Sleep is feeling heavy,
and night is coming on *

17:33.686 --> 17:36.489
* The nightmare demon lullaby,
Grim Reaper come. *

17:36.523 --> 17:40.260
Whoo! I put a little
extra sauce on that last one.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.361
What'd you think?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.330
Yeah, yeah,
it was okay.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.298
Uh, you know,

17:45.332 --> 17:47.100
maybe we could make a few
adjustments, though, huh?

17:47.134 --> 17:48.268
What kind
of adjustments?

17:48.301 --> 17:51.371
Well, I just think on a couple
songs, maybe, you know,

17:51.404 --> 17:53.440
we could do something
a bit different.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.109
Like more hardcore?
More death metal?

17:56.143 --> 17:58.478
I was thinking maybe
like more, um...

17:58.511 --> 18:01.114
uh... regular.

18:01.148 --> 18:03.716
What are you talking about?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.253
We invented the Growl Country
style together.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.221
It's our signature.
Yeah, but we got

18:08.255 --> 18:11.524
a three-song set, so maybe, we
can, you know, play one cover.

18:11.558 --> 18:15.795
There's no way in hell
that I, Meatball Reuther,

18:15.828 --> 18:18.231
will ever sing a cover.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.167
That's my face up there.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.235
Yeah, but it's my band,
Meatball.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.472
You wouldn't be here singing if
I didn't call you last week...

18:25.505 --> 18:27.440
And maybe now I wish you hadn't.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.609
'Cause clearly
I'm holding you back.

18:29.642 --> 18:33.446
Well, let me cut you free
of your chains. I quit.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.350
Have fun, Wade Kin-sellout.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.852
Enjoy the high school
reunion circuit.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.892
WALT:
 Hello?

18:45.925 --> 18:47.927
Walt, what happened
to your bachelor party?

18:47.960 --> 18:51.498
Well... Kyle was a little bit
more straightlaced

18:51.531 --> 18:52.565
than I remember.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.766
It was a daytime thing.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.901
And co-ed.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.404
Plus you seemed a touch
disappointed when I left, so...

18:57.437 --> 18:59.506
Oh, no.
...figured I'd come
find you.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.907
Look at you.
You look great.

19:00.940 --> 19:01.774
Oh!

19:01.808 --> 19:03.376
Is your hair purple?

19:03.410 --> 19:05.478
Oh, yeah. I was just having
a little sister time.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.780
You remember Magnolia.
Hey.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.250
Hey, if you guys
already got plans, then...

19:10.283 --> 19:12.819
Oh, no, no, no. I'll just go
change, and we can go for a walk

19:12.852 --> 19:14.687
and all head out to dinner.

19:14.721 --> 19:15.755
What do you say, Magnolia?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.657
Actually, you guys go.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.261
I could really use the time
and do my homework instead.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.362
Your homework?

19:22.395 --> 19:25.365
I'm 15.
I do have homework.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.666
Go! It's fine.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.671
(country rock playing)

19:31.704 --> 19:33.273
* Ten till 12 is wine
and dancing *

19:33.306 --> 19:34.574
* Midnight starts
the hard romancing *

19:34.607 --> 19:35.842
* One o'clock
that truck is rocking *

19:35.875 --> 19:38.278
* Two is coming,
still no stopping *

19:38.311 --> 19:39.679
* Break to check
the clock at three *

19:39.712 --> 19:40.780
* They're right on where
they want to be *

19:40.813 --> 19:41.748
* Four o'clock,
get up and going *

19:41.781 --> 19:45.852
* Five o'clock,
that rooster's crowing... *

19:45.885 --> 19:49.222
They sound great,
don't they?

19:49.856 --> 19:54.727
* Hey... hey-hey, yeah

19:57.864 --> 20:00.767
* Ain't going down
till the sun comes up *

20:00.800 --> 20:02.602
(band plays flourish)

20:02.635 --> 20:05.505
(whoops)
* Hey, yeah!

20:05.538 --> 20:07.607
(whooping)

20:08.575 --> 20:10.477
(song ends, cheering)

20:15.948 --> 20:17.850
How'd you pull that off?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.586
Wade called me
out of the blue.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.554
Nice.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.425
Hey, hey.
See what I mean?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.594
Legitimate rocker cred.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.997
And you did not like it?

20:31.030 --> 20:34.367
No, you sounded fantastic.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.968
But...?

20:36.002 --> 20:39.939
But when I got my life back on
track, I gave myself a policy:

20:39.972 --> 20:42.442
no more dating musicians.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.776
I'm not a musician.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.712
I'm a lawyer.
I got a real job.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.581
So were all my other musicians.
They had day jobs, too, okay?

20:48.615 --> 20:51.651
It's a rule, George Tucker,
and I live by it.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.389
Hey! Here.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.627
What happened?
Last-minute change of plans?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.961
Where's Meatball?

21:01.994 --> 21:04.397
Creative differences.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.834
Yeah, Meatball decided he didn't
want to sell out, so...

21:07.867 --> 21:11.638
Well, that is his loss because
you guys sounded incredible.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.406
Amazing.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.974
Wade, I think
that you might win.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.910
Well, I'd love to sit around
and soak up all the support,

21:17.944 --> 21:20.046
but me and the band have a bunch
more covers

21:20.079 --> 21:23.282
to practice for tonight, so...

21:28.955 --> 21:30.056
So, how's the chicken?

21:30.089 --> 21:32.659
I mean, this is the only
civilized restaurant in town,

21:32.692 --> 21:33.960
but Delma does overcook.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.329
Don't you worry.
It's perfect.
Good.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.831
Lemon! What are the odds
of running into you

21:38.865 --> 21:41.067
like this twice in two days?

21:41.100 --> 21:43.069
I wouldn't know,
I don't like to gamble.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.338
CRICKETT:
What happened
to your hair?

21:45.372 --> 21:47.674
I think it looks
sensational.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.676
Well, this is courtesy
of Magnolia.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.744
She and I have been having
such fun together.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.546
Speaking of new looks,
Crickett's thinking

21:53.580 --> 21:54.814
of redoing her kitchen.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.049
I was thinking
of going modern, you know,

21:57.083 --> 21:59.051
like gray walls and
stainless steel appliances.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.520
(yelps)

22:00.553 --> 22:02.489
Gray walls?

22:02.522 --> 22:04.657
Like a submarine.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.426
Or a fallout shelter. (laughs)

22:06.459 --> 22:07.660
Maybe you could

22:07.694 --> 22:08.828
take a look at
my tile samples?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.797
No, thank you.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.964
As you can
see, I'm

22:11.998 --> 22:13.733
on a romantic date with Walt.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.470
Hey.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.971
Oh.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.006
Okay. (laughs)

22:20.039 --> 22:21.874
We'll be over there

22:21.908 --> 22:24.076
in case you change
your mind.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.380
I cannot believe
that didn't work.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.717
Are you sure? Because
we can join your friends.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.751
I don't mind.

22:31.784 --> 22:32.752
I am sure.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.987
All I need is you.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.056
I mean, who cares
about Crickett's kitchen?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.960
I mean, you and I have
so much more in common

22:40.993 --> 22:42.094
than I do with them anyways.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.399
Like our mutual affection
for old movies.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.801
In fact, Philadelphia Story's
playing in Mobile.

22:48.835 --> 22:49.802
We should go.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.004
Yeah, that sounds fine.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.874
Tomorrow then. Oh, and then
the next day is Doctor Zhivago.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.944
Ah... uh, sure, yeah,
I guess so.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.479
Great.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.013
And Friday maybe
we could go the theater.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.782
Uh, Dash is
doing his own

23:02.815 --> 23:03.916
stage version of Funny Girl.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.619
And next Christmas,
maybe we should go

23:06.653 --> 23:07.987
on a theater-themed cruise.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.490
You say, next Christmas?

23:10.523 --> 23:11.991
Uh-huh.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.126
(clears throat)

23:16.028 --> 23:17.630
LAVON:
Is everything set?

23:17.664 --> 23:18.898
All right, great.
I'm gonna make sure

23:18.931 --> 23:21.534
Wanda arrives
in exactly 20 minutes.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.604
I just heard Babs Foster telling
Mrs. Mayfair that Tom's

23:24.637 --> 23:27.640
in town square setting up what
looks like a marriage proposal.

23:27.674 --> 23:28.975
Oh, no.
I know.

23:29.008 --> 23:29.976
Can you believe it?

23:30.009 --> 23:32.011
This is a disaster.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.052
Sign this set list.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.188
It'll be worth a
small fortune someday

23:42.221 --> 23:44.123
on that Antique
 Roadshow program.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.692
WALLY:
You guys sound
real good, Wade.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.460
That prize money's
in the bag.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.829
Don't tell Uncle Wally,
but I'd love to be

23:49.862 --> 23:51.531
the first employee
at your new bar.

23:51.564 --> 23:52.465
Yeah, well,

23:52.499 --> 23:55.201
lot of great bands competing
tonight, Wanda.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.169
You know, nothing's
a sure thing.

23:57.203 --> 24:00.072
Except death and taxes.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.073
(laughs)

24:01.107 --> 24:04.043
GEORGE:
Hey, Tansy.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.479
You're really doing this?

24:06.513 --> 24:08.815
Yeah, yeah,
Wade needs my help.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.150
Plus I think it's
gonna be pretty fun.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.986
But I told you, I...
Tansy.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.890
Look, I was with a woman for
15 years who tried to choose

24:17.924 --> 24:21.093
my socks and tie combination
every single day.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.696
Okay, I-I can't be with
somebody anymore

24:23.730 --> 24:26.098
who dictates
what I can and cannot do.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.801
So if you want
to show up tonight

24:28.835 --> 24:32.104
and support me,
that would be great.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.041
But I am going

24:35.074 --> 24:36.676
to battle

24:36.709 --> 24:38.611
with my band.

24:52.792 --> 24:53.960
Hi...

24:53.993 --> 24:54.927
My... I'm Tom.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.630
And you are Mrs. Sprinkles.
(horses grunts)

24:57.664 --> 24:59.131
Mr. Sprinkles,
Mr. Sprinkles, I'm sorry.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.033
I-I didn't know,
I didn't know.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.935
I had no idea.
LAVON: Tom!

25:02.969 --> 25:04.871
Wait, what...?

25:04.904 --> 25:06.639
No, no, you're too early.
I'm still just trying

25:06.673 --> 25:08.074
to get to know
Mr. and Mrs. Sprinkles.

25:08.107 --> 25:11.177
That's the horses-- I'm not
ready for Wanda right now.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.612
No, it's okay, Tom.

25:12.645 --> 25:15.615
Uh, well, actually
it's not okay...

25:15.648 --> 25:16.816
it...

25:16.849 --> 25:19.151
Wanda's not coming.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.820
So you can stop
with the horses.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.221
What?

25:22.254 --> 25:24.624
Why-why wouldn't she be
coming... Is she sick?

25:24.657 --> 25:26.993
Or paralyzed from
the neck down?
No, no, no.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.628
She's fine.
Well, Levon,

25:28.661 --> 25:30.730
if something's wrong,
you got to tell me.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.034
I overheard Wanda
talking to Wally.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.036
She-she doesn't
want you to propose.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.907
What... But that-that
doesn't make sense beca...

25:40.940 --> 25:42.909
because Wanda would
never say something

25:42.942 --> 25:44.611
like that... that...

25:44.644 --> 25:46.145
I don't believe it.
It's not possible!

25:46.178 --> 25:47.980
(horse neighing)

25:48.014 --> 25:49.849
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.618
Lavon, Lavon...!

25:51.651 --> 25:54.053
(horses neighing)

25:54.086 --> 25:55.121
Help, help!

25:55.154 --> 25:56.322
Tom!

25:56.355 --> 25:57.323
Help!

25:57.356 --> 25:58.925
Tom!

25:58.958 --> 26:00.793
Please!

26:00.827 --> 26:01.828
Tom! (yells)

26:02.829 --> 26:04.096
Mag, you won't believe
what just happened...

26:04.130 --> 26:06.132
(sighs)

26:10.302 --> 26:12.639
(beeps)

26:12.672 --> 26:14.674
(phone line ringing)
(cell phone ringing)

26:16.709 --> 26:19.578
(ringing)

26:22.715 --> 26:24.817
(sighs)
Got your text.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.786
Got about five minutes
before George and I go play

26:26.819 --> 26:28.087
some real life Rock Band,
so what's up?

26:28.120 --> 26:30.923
Let me start by saying
that I am really sorry.

26:30.957 --> 26:31.924
I never should've

26:31.958 --> 26:34.894
butted-in in the first place.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.196
I screwed up trying to interfere

26:37.229 --> 26:39.231
with the way that
you were doing things.

26:39.265 --> 26:43.102
But... I need you to know

26:43.135 --> 26:46.372
that I support you for you.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.708
Reaching for your dream.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.880
(clears throat)

26:57.183 --> 26:58.384
Ta-da!

26:58.417 --> 26:59.618
(laughs)

27:01.387 --> 27:03.856
Um...

27:03.890 --> 27:06.926
Thank you.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.261
I know

27:09.295 --> 27:12.131
that you will win tonight.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.967
'Cause I believe in you.

27:15.001 --> 27:18.004
It's... it's amazing.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.039
(cell phone ringing)

27:23.075 --> 27:25.044
Lavon, I'm

27:25.077 --> 27:27.413
in the middle of something,
I can't...

27:27.446 --> 27:29.816
Oh, my God. (sighs)

27:29.849 --> 27:31.984
I'll be right there.

27:32.018 --> 27:35.454
Look, Tom Long got into it
with some horses...

27:35.487 --> 27:37.423
uh...

27:37.456 --> 27:39.425
I'll see you
at the battle, okay?

27:39.458 --> 27:40.860
All right.

28:00.947 --> 28:03.315
* I'm high and dry

28:03.349 --> 28:09.021
* It's a desert, baby,
since you left town. *

28:09.055 --> 28:11.690
*

28:14.326 --> 28:16.896
Hey, great to see you, handsome.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.731
I can't wait to see
you kill it up there.

28:18.765 --> 28:19.799
Yeah, thanks.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.433
Good luck.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.203
Hey, look, the sellout.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.972
I'm really gonna
enjoy booing you

28:26.005 --> 28:28.074
and your pal Glee Club up there.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.342
Hey, Tucker?

28:30.376 --> 28:33.846
I was thinking maybe we should
do "Ring of Fire" first instead.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.481
Or I guess we
could scratch that

28:35.514 --> 28:36.983
and we could do,
uh, "Ramblin' Man."

28:37.016 --> 28:38.217
I mean, we killed
that one once before, right?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.352
All right, man, look.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.320
Everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

28:41.353 --> 28:43.489
Let's just play what we
practiced, all right?

28:43.522 --> 28:45.792
And maybe put down
the drink 'cause we still

28:45.825 --> 28:46.926
got six bands to go, all right?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.060
Just try to relax, Wade.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.963
You relax, man.

28:50.997 --> 28:54.934
This is too important.

28:57.369 --> 29:00.272
*

29:00.306 --> 29:01.407
(song ends)

29:01.440 --> 29:04.410
ANNOUNCER:
Give it up for Logan Mize.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.379
But you already
let my friends in.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.915
Please, I forgot my I.D.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.783
Just look at me.

29:10.817 --> 29:11.918
Do I look like
a teenager to you?

29:11.951 --> 29:13.986
Put your eyes back in your head
before I call the cops.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.087
This girl is 15.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.188
This was totally
about to work.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.790
You are in so
much trouble.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.158
Why are you talking
to me like a mom?

29:19.191 --> 29:20.326
I thought we were
best friends now.

29:20.359 --> 29:21.961
Yeah, well, best friends
don't break curfew

29:21.994 --> 29:23.963
and sneak out to bars the minute
they let their guard down.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.832
Now get into the car!

29:29.902 --> 29:32.404
Lemon, what a coincidence.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.908
Why do you two keep showing up?

29:38.244 --> 29:41.047
For the love of God, you're
using that app, aren't you?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.982
App? What app?
I-I don't have an app.

29:43.015 --> 29:46.318
I can't believe that
you would stoop so low.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.521
Lemon, how long are you gonna
be mad at me about this?

29:49.555 --> 29:50.556
I don't know.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.558
But no amount of carefully
constructed run-ins

29:52.591 --> 29:54.861
is gonna change the fact
that you betrayed me.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.096
I have apologized
again and again.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.230
What more do you want?

29:58.264 --> 30:00.499
We live in the same town.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.268
We share a business.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.838
Well...

30:05.872 --> 30:07.974
I don't think
that we should anymore.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.944
I want to dissolve AnnaBeth's.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.882
Ooh...

30:19.051 --> 30:22.188
I can't believe it.
(groans)

30:22.221 --> 30:24.190
Well, nothing's broken,
just a mild whiplash.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.591
No, no, I mean Wanda.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.526
I can't believe she doesn't
want me to propose.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.929
I know how
she feels about me.

30:29.962 --> 30:33.032
Well, you think you do,
and then...

30:33.065 --> 30:34.200
Look, you may not
believe me,

30:34.233 --> 30:36.002
but there is
a silver lining here.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.470
(gasps)
Oh, and what is that?

30:38.504 --> 30:40.239
That you didn't have to go
through with the proposal,

30:40.272 --> 30:42.608
make a fool out of yourself.
SHULA: Hello?

30:42.641 --> 30:44.576
Is Tom Long in here?

30:44.610 --> 30:45.611
Tom!

30:45.644 --> 30:46.645
There you are.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.947
We've been looking

30:47.980 --> 30:49.081
for you everywhere.

30:49.115 --> 30:51.617
Now there's an emergency
in town square

30:51.650 --> 30:53.319
and you got to come quick.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.022
Tom is not going
anywhere quick.
He should be resting.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.556
(gasping)

30:57.589 --> 30:59.658
Sorry, Dr. Hart,
it's my duty.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.094
I'm a trained
first responder.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.562
(groans)

31:12.538 --> 31:14.606
Are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.976
(people groaning)

31:17.009 --> 31:20.046
LAVON:
The undead descending
upon BlueBell?

31:20.079 --> 31:22.114
Frank was right.

31:22.148 --> 31:24.516
The zombie apocalypse
is upon us.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.386
(music begins playing)

31:34.160 --> 31:38.397
* Baby, when I met you
there was peace unknown *

31:38.430 --> 31:43.135
* I set out to get you
with a fine-tooth comb *

31:43.169 --> 31:46.005
* I was sucked inside

31:46.038 --> 31:48.607
* There was something going on

31:51.043 --> 31:53.412
* Tender love is blind

31:53.445 --> 31:57.016
There are so many levels
of weird going on right now.

31:57.049 --> 32:01.353
* All this love we feel
needs no conversation *

32:01.387 --> 32:04.023
"Islands in the Stream."

32:04.056 --> 32:07.193
Wait a minute, those zombies
are singing my favorite song.

32:07.226 --> 32:10.162
* Making love
with each other, uh-huh *

32:10.196 --> 32:12.198
* Islands in the stream

32:12.231 --> 32:14.433
* That is what we are

32:14.466 --> 32:16.168
* No one in-between

32:16.202 --> 32:18.170
* How can we be wrong?

32:18.204 --> 32:21.207
* Sail away with me

32:21.240 --> 32:24.343
* To another world

32:24.376 --> 32:28.214
* And we rely
on each other, uh-huh *

32:28.247 --> 32:31.117
* From one lover
to another *

32:31.150 --> 32:33.119
* Uh-huh

32:38.390 --> 32:40.626
I heard you didn't
want me to propose.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.095
You said it would be a disaster.

32:43.129 --> 32:47.266
That's just because the costumes
and makeup took forever to do.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.002
So, you don't want to break up?

32:50.036 --> 32:51.437
Break up?

32:51.470 --> 32:54.073
How could I ever?

32:54.106 --> 32:55.341
Tom Long...

32:56.375 --> 32:59.378
...will you marry me?

32:59.411 --> 33:01.247
Only if you'll marry me.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.482
(laughs)

33:03.515 --> 33:05.251
* No more will you cry

33:05.284 --> 33:08.154
* Baby, I will hurt you never

33:08.187 --> 33:10.756
* We start and end as one

33:10.789 --> 33:12.458
* In love forever

33:12.491 --> 33:15.094
* We can ride together

33:15.127 --> 33:16.628
* Uh-huh

33:16.662 --> 33:18.497
* Making love

33:18.530 --> 33:21.033
* With each other, uh-huh

33:21.067 --> 33:23.435
I can't believe I
almost ruined that.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.372
I don't think anyone
could have ruined that.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.175
Oh! I gotta go!

33:29.208 --> 33:30.576
I gotta go to
Battle of the Bands.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.577
O-Okay.
I'll see you.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.578
All right.
Bye.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.146
(screams)

33:34.180 --> 33:37.383
* No one in-between

33:37.416 --> 33:40.219
* How can we be wrong?

33:40.252 --> 33:41.553
* Sail away with me

33:41.587 --> 33:44.356
* To another world

33:44.390 --> 33:46.792
* And we rely on each other

33:46.825 --> 33:48.627
* Uh-huh

33:48.660 --> 33:49.761
* From one lover

33:49.795 --> 33:52.798
* To another, uh-huh.

33:52.831 --> 33:55.367
*

33:55.401 --> 33:57.035
(cheering, whistling)

34:03.142 --> 34:03.942
Hey.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.444
Hey. What are you doing
down there?

34:05.477 --> 34:06.778
Mm.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.847
I'm just stayin'
hydrated, my friend.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.581
All right. Yeah.
Very funny.

34:10.616 --> 34:11.783
Very funny.
Come on, Wade.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.284
(glass clatters)
Get up. Get up.

34:13.319 --> 34:14.853
Get up.
Sit down right here.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.322
Okay. I'm gonna
get you some coffee

34:17.356 --> 34:18.556
and you're gonna
chug it, all right?

34:18.590 --> 34:21.693
We're up next,
so... Hey. Hey.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.161
It's only a couple
of songs, Wade.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.795
All right? You could
do this in your sleep.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.431
It's easy, man.
Yeah.

34:26.465 --> 34:29.435
Everything comes so easy
to Goldenboy George.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.471
We lose, it's just
a teeny little bump

34:32.504 --> 34:34.473
in the otherwise well-paved road

34:34.505 --> 34:35.841
of your life.
Okay, you
have no idea

34:35.873 --> 34:37.576
what you're
talking about, Wade.

34:37.609 --> 34:38.844
I busted my ass

34:38.877 --> 34:40.478
to get to
where I am.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.281
I made my own success.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.514
You want yours?

34:43.549 --> 34:46.152
Then man up for once,
and go work for it.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.353
See, I got things
at stake, here.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.721
Yeah, I know how much
you want that bar.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.324
No, it's not just
about the bar, George.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.328
I could lose...
everything.

34:56.362 --> 34:59.198
EMCEE:
And now, give it up
for Mind Face!

34:59.231 --> 35:00.866
(crowd cheering)

35:00.899 --> 35:03.535
Wade, I promise you,
we are gonna be great.

35:03.569 --> 35:04.670
Okay? So let's...

35:04.703 --> 35:05.904
let's just put
the drink down...

35:05.937 --> 35:07.573
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:07.606 --> 35:09.608
George isn't just a lawyer

35:09.641 --> 35:11.243
and a damn fine singer,

35:11.277 --> 35:14.480
he's also the alcohol police.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.682
Well, I don't need you
judging me, Mr. Tucker.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.818
Hmm. And I also don't
need you in my band.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.654
You're fired.

35:22.688 --> 35:25.457
Hi. You still remember
the set list?

35:25.491 --> 35:26.925
Are you kidding me?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.294
Hell yeah!

35:28.327 --> 35:29.795
Come on.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.339
And the winner of tonight's
Battle of the Bands

35:40.372 --> 35:42.874
and the $20,000
is Logan Mize!

35:42.908 --> 35:43.875
(cheering)

35:43.909 --> 35:45.577
Oh, man!

35:45.611 --> 35:47.579
This thing
is rigged.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.785
Oh. Well, well, well.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.321
Look who showed up.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.922
I decided I couldn't
miss the chance

35:56.955 --> 35:59.858
to come support
my amazingly talented

35:59.891 --> 36:01.193
singin' lawyer.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.861
(giggles)
Even if he

36:02.894 --> 36:04.663
didn't get a chance
to show his stuff.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.465
Yeah? And what about your, uh...

36:06.498 --> 36:07.599
your rule?

36:07.633 --> 36:10.168
I guess you're the exception.

36:11.437 --> 36:12.671
I made the rule

36:12.704 --> 36:14.773
so that I didn't fall back
into old patterns.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.243
Musicians are my
Achilles' heel.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.411
The hours, the groupies...

36:19.445 --> 36:21.480
None of it helped
with my trust issues.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.686
And there's the man who gave 'em
to me in the first place.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.822
You totally should've won.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.225
Hey.

36:35.327 --> 36:37.263
Better get comfy,
'cause you're not leaving here

36:37.296 --> 36:38.597
for the rest of the weekend.

36:38.630 --> 36:40.566
One little
adventure,

36:40.599 --> 36:41.833
and you turn into
a prison warden.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.635
Yep, you can consider
this Alcatraz.

36:43.669 --> 36:44.636
I don't know

36:44.670 --> 36:45.837
who you are anymore.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.506
One minute you want
to be my best friend,

36:47.539 --> 36:49.007
and then you drop me
like a hot potato

36:49.040 --> 36:50.141
for your boyfriend.
You know what,

36:50.175 --> 36:52.511
you're not the only one
who got dropped tonight, okay?

36:52.544 --> 36:53.779
So just get over it.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.448
What?

36:56.482 --> 36:57.849
(sighs)

36:57.883 --> 36:59.885
I'm sorry.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.854
Walt broke up with me.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.757
The dentist dumped you? Why?

37:05.791 --> 37:08.494
I guess I scared him off.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.663
For the same reason
that I let you buy

37:11.697 --> 37:13.332
that ridiculous tiny dress.

37:13.365 --> 37:16.468
I was just trying
so hard not to...

37:16.502 --> 37:17.603
be lonely.

37:17.636 --> 37:18.970
You?

37:19.004 --> 37:20.539
Lonely?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.574
You've never been
alone your whole life.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.011
Yeah, well...

37:26.044 --> 37:28.647
maybe that's the problem.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.616
AnnaBeth and I

37:30.649 --> 37:32.618
had a falling-out.

37:32.651 --> 37:33.919
And I've just been
so desperately

37:33.952 --> 37:35.287
trying to replace her

37:35.321 --> 37:37.923
with either you or with Walt...

37:37.956 --> 37:40.626
that I just let you take
advantage of me.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.428
I'm 15.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.696
I'll take advantage of
anyone who'll let me.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.732
(laughs)

37:47.999 --> 37:50.636
Well, I'm not gonna let it
happen again, okay?

37:51.803 --> 37:54.773
Sweetheart, I can't be
your best friend.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.975
Because you still need
a big sister.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.446
I do.

38:00.479 --> 38:03.549
But I didn't mind having you
as a best friend, either.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.084
(exhales)

38:06.117 --> 38:07.586
Come here.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.992
(whispers)

38:16.828 --> 38:18.797
(sighs)

38:22.568 --> 38:25.404
Hey, Wade.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.806
You can save your closing
argument, Mr. Attorney.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.675
Verdict's in.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.976
Okay.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.011
Look, man, I just...

38:33.044 --> 38:34.946
I just want to know what
the hell's going on with you.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.449
Look, it's none of your
business, all right?

38:37.483 --> 38:39.418
I just want to
be left alone.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.121
Okay.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.357
Okay, so you lost.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.459
It happens.

38:47.493 --> 38:48.594
Hey, look...

38:48.627 --> 38:50.696
you're going to have plenty
of other chances, all right?

38:50.729 --> 38:52.063
Th-There's plenty
of other ways

38:52.097 --> 38:54.132
that you can... you can
raise money for your bar.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.102
You mean plenty
of ways to fail.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.937
So that's it.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.772
That's that, we're just...

39:00.806 --> 39:02.574
we're just gonna quit.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.843
You know something,
George, I'm...

39:04.876 --> 39:07.979
I'm sick of people
thinking I can do better,

39:08.013 --> 39:10.148
be better than
who I am.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.419
They're always gonna
get let down.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.486
No, they're not.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.987
That's not true.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.122
And-and you know it, Wade.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.890
See? There you go.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.926
Believin' in me again.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.128
Wow.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.764
Save your money, Tucker,
I ain't worth it.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.899
(sighs): Now, if
you don't mind...

39:27.933 --> 39:29.901
I'm gonna get back
to being me.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.003
*

39:32.037 --> 39:33.772
Wade, come on.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.608
Hey, Wade.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.644
*

39:46.184 --> 39:48.386
(knocking)

39:51.222 --> 39:54.025
Lavon, what are you...
No, I know I said

39:54.059 --> 39:56.061
I was done in the
romance department,

39:56.094 --> 39:58.830
but these last few days
I've helped couples

39:58.864 --> 40:02.033
find each other in
war zones and...

40:02.067 --> 40:04.636
among the undead.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.705
But it made me
realize that...

40:06.738 --> 40:10.175
this is worth
fighting for.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.811
Now, I-I know

40:12.844 --> 40:15.581
you got your
girl code, but...

40:17.616 --> 40:19.851
...I will wait.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.424
That's all.

40:27.959 --> 40:29.961
*

40:38.804 --> 40:40.939
*

40:40.972 --> 40:42.073
Hey.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.075
You would not believe
the night I've had.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.577
I got so lost.
This place is

40:45.611 --> 40:46.845
not easy to find--
maybe that's why

40:46.878 --> 40:47.879
they call it
 Tricky Rick's.

40:47.913 --> 40:48.947
I can't believe
that I missed

40:48.980 --> 40:50.215
the whole thing.
What happened?

40:50.248 --> 40:51.182
How'd you guys do?

40:51.216 --> 40:54.019
Um...
Wade kicked George
out of the band

40:54.052 --> 40:56.087
and went on
with Meatball.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.956
What?!

40:57.989 --> 41:00.826
Oh, no! So he lost?
GEORGE:
Yeah.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.728
Big-time.

41:02.761 --> 41:06.498
Oh, crap! Well, that
explains why he isn't
answering his phone.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.667
Well, is he okay?
Where is he?

41:08.700 --> 41:11.002
Uh, you know,
I-I think that he...

41:12.037 --> 41:14.239
Um... I think he left.

41:14.272 --> 41:15.607
Mm.
It was just...

41:15.641 --> 41:18.009
it was a really rough
night for him, so...

41:18.043 --> 41:20.779
He must be furious at me.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.147
(sighs)

41:23.915 --> 41:25.851
Why don't you
follow us home.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.853
That way you
won't get lost.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.921
Yeah. Yeah, that's
a good idea. That's...

41:29.955 --> 41:31.990
Yeah, okay.

41:32.023 --> 41:35.026
