PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 47254.1 .

00:06.840 --> 00:09.299
A delegation of the Cairn
have just come onboard.

00:09.467 --> 00:12.761
This telepathic species
has no concept of spoken language

00:12.929 --> 00:17.266
and is being instructed in its use
by an old friend.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.727
I don't know what they have done
without me.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.770
First, I had to learn
how they communicate.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.481
- It was an exhausting process.
- It must have been.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.775
Quite different
from Betazoid telepathy.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.527
We transmit words.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.656
With the Cairn, it's, uh-- It's images.
Uh, a flood of them.

00:32.824 --> 00:33.949
All at the same time.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.951
- It's overwhelming.
- I can imagine.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.871
Actually, it's a very efficient way
of communicating.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.831
If two Cairn
were having this conversation,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.666
it would have been
over minutes ago.

00:42.834 --> 00:43.876
Really?

00:44.044 --> 00:47.212
Of course they realize that they'll
want to communicate verbally

00:47.380 --> 00:49.381
if they join the Federation.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.758
Do me a favor.

00:50.925 --> 00:54.219
Introduce yourself to one of them.
Engage them in conversation.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.889
- They need the practice.
- I'd be happy to.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.307
It's called a VISOR.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.892
It enables me to see.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.810
Like my vocal enhancer.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.687
It helps me make sounds.

01:03.855 --> 01:07.483
Well, I see you've already met
my star pupil.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.694
Hedril's picked up spoken language
much faster than the others.

01:10.862 --> 01:12.988
It is often the case
that children learn languages

01:13.156 --> 01:14.573
more easily than adults.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.826
Deanna was quite good at languages
when she was little.

01:17.994 --> 01:22.331
- Uh, where is Deanna?
- Well, she must be here somewhere.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.042
Hedril, darling...

01:28.171 --> 01:29.671
What?

01:29.881 --> 01:32.674
Um, go find your father, dear.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.843
I wanna talk to him.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.307
Mrs. Troi?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.685
Oh, I'm just a little tired. Heh.

01:43.853 --> 01:48.440
This constant telepathy
with the Cairn, um...

01:48.817 --> 01:52.152
No, I'm-- I'm fine, really.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.573
MAN 1 : Thank you.
MAN 2: Go ahead, sir.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.701
Aren't you going to mingle,
Mr. Worf?

02:02.497 --> 02:05.040
I do not care for telepaths.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.543
They make me uneasy.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.795
Oh, don't worry.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.881
The Cairn couldn't read your thoughts
even if they wanted to.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.050
Your brain
isn't sophisticated enough.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.721
Neither is yours, dear.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.808
They can only communicate
with other telepaths.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.310
Have either of you seen Deanna?

02:25.478 --> 02:27.187
She was working,
but she said she would be--

02:33.570 --> 02:34.695
Deanna, dear, come with me.

02:34.863 --> 02:39.199
I want you to meet the senior diplomat
of the Cairn delegation.

I've been telling you about, Deanna.

what do you think of the Enterprise?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.031
Oh. Um...

03:19.199 --> 03:21.408
It is beautiful.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.452
Comfortable also.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.830
- I'm glad you think so.
- Um...

03:27.248 --> 03:31.084
There is another word
that describes it. Mm...

03:31.544 --> 03:33.170
Agh.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.713
But l cannot remember.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.841
You've learned a great deal
in a very short time.

03:38.009 --> 03:40.636
I'm sure it won't be long
before your words do justice

03:40.803 --> 03:42.804
to your thoughts.

03:44.432 --> 03:49.728
Your mother told me of your need.

03:50.813 --> 03:51.855
Need?

03:52.357 --> 03:53.941
Um, heh.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.734
A moment.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.029

03:59.197 --> 04:00.489
You need a husband.

Good morning.
So, what did you think of Maques?

Why did you do that, Mother?
You embarrassed both of us.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.541
Oh, he's really very sweet
and lonely.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.502
Poor man. A widower.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.962
- Raising a child alone.
- Mother, don't start.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.131
I just think it's time
for you to settle down.

06:23.299 --> 06:27.177

I'm just tired
from working with the Cairn.

Mm-hm.

- You don't have to.
- My words...

08:09.280 --> 08:12.199
They were confused.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.244
It wasn't your fault.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.913
Please.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.624
My mother misled you.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.628
Not in everything.

08:25.421 --> 08:31.301
She has an image of you

08:31.969 --> 08:33.345

08:34.555 --> 08:36.097
She shared it with me.

You are even more beautiful.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.403
it is direct.

Nothing is hidden.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.325
Yes?

08:55.493 --> 09:02.040
Your mother is the first
to learn our telepathy.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.670
You mean, you've never had telepathy
with someone who wasn't Cairn?

09:06.837 --> 09:08.463
No.

09:10.967 --> 09:15.971
To communicate with her
is very different.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.722
In what way?

09:20.017 --> 09:24.020
Always, there is a part
of her that, um...

A part of her that is dark.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.281
- Dark?
- Um--

A part of her that...

Do you understand?

09:48.504 --> 09:50.839
Have you asked my mother
about this?

"Privacy."

Of course.

10:06.522 --> 10:10.900
You said among the Cairn,
nothing is hidden.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.696
We value honesty, but we don't
always share everything

10:14.864 --> 10:16.281
we're thinking and feeling.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.953
This is privacy?

10:22.705 --> 10:23.788
Yes.

It is normal?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.959
For us, yes.

It is our way.

she just fell apart.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.668
She's under a lot of stress.

She's preparing the Cairn
to meet with the Federation Council.

I'm sensing some very
erratic emotions from her.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.721
Even the clothes she's wearing
are unusual.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.264
They're so subdued.

and talk with her for a minute.

- Why don't you leave her alone?

11:32.983 --> 11:35.276

You're fine, but your psilosynine levels
are a little low.

- Psilo-what? Hmm?
- It's a neurotransmitter

11:58.467 --> 12:00.218
- involved in telepathy.
- Oh.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.929
It's been depleted
by your work with the Cairn.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.474
You're going to have to try to avoid
telepathic communication for a while.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.643
- I can't.
- Why?

12:08.811 --> 12:12.313
Well, we only have three days left,
and, oh, well,

12:12.481 --> 12:14.315

12:14.483 --> 12:16.651
Lwaxana, I'm sorry,

12:16.819 --> 12:20.363
but you're going to have
to take some time and rest.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.744
Maybe I can help with the Cairn.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.789
No. You're only half Betazoid, dear.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.668
And you have no experience
with their form of telepathy.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.420
Then I won't use telepathy.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.921
We'll work verbally.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.508
I suppose we could do that.

12:40.676 --> 12:44.053
If they don't understand something,
I'll explain it to them telepathically.

12:44.221 --> 12:47.599
No. You'll work verbally too.

The point is for you to get
some rest, Mother.

12:51.228 --> 12:54.481
Besides, it will do them good
to have to figure things out with words.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.275
Heh.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.152
I suppose you're right.

Arbor means "tree."

by John Milton.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.975
Please, what is a poem?

13:32.394 --> 13:36.231
Poetry is an art form
that uses words

13:36.398 --> 13:39.943
put together in new
and unexpected ways.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.569
Sometimes in rhyme.

13:41.737 --> 13:46.449
Milton was speculating that in heaven,
roses wouldn't have thorns.

It's a jewel plant from Folar lII.

The plant secretes a resin
which is collected within the blossom.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.247

the resin has hardened

14:34.415 --> 14:36.499

It's almost as if her brain

The paracortex

17:41.393 --> 17:45.521
Maques sensed
what he calls "a dark place."

17:45.689 --> 17:49.901
He tried to tell me about it before

17:50.069 --> 17:52.278

about thoughts

17:52.446 --> 17:54.697
my mother was keeping private.

But what he meant was
that there was something happening

It's part of the Betazoid psyche.

It's a kind of filtering mechanism

that your mother's meta-conscious

18:10.172 --> 18:11.839

He feels that whatever is wrong
with her is centered there.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.596
If he's right, it may mean that
she's suffered some kind of trauma

just can't tolerate.
