00:05.039 --> 00:06.807
Previously on ER:

00:06.807 --> 00:08.542
Anything for my roomie.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.111
WOMAN:
Congratulations.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.545
Thank you. It was supposed
to be a secret.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.646
Everybody was saying
you were getting puffy.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.382
I had to defend you.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.450
It's a part-time job,
flexible hours, good pay.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.419
You and Alex, you're
more than welcome

00:18.419 --> 00:19.687
to come live with me.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.821
Move in.

00:20.821 --> 00:24.158
You need to undergo
an evaluation

00:24.158 --> 00:25.393
by the Impaired Physician
Committee.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.727
You're serious?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.762
Yeah, well, I don't
need that, okay?
I do.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.150 --> 00:50.818
Oh! Don't shoot.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.720
Sorry.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.422
Did I wake you?

00:54.422 --> 00:55.623
I couldn't find
my laser pointer.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.258
I had to root around a bit.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.727
Yes, I ate all your cereal
at 4:00 a.m.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.129
and no,
there's no milk left, either.

01:01.129 --> 01:02.496
I'm a terrible roommate.

01:02.496 --> 01:05.299
It'll be fine.
You know, I've known

01:05.299 --> 01:07.335
about this
trauma conference
for two months,

01:07.335 --> 01:09.203
so the fact that I'm this
unprepared two hours before

01:09.203 --> 01:10.538
is quite unsettling.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.772
Well, you don't want
to over-rehearse your talk.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.141
You should just wing it,

01:13.141 --> 01:14.808
keep it fresh.
Wing it?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.144
It's not open mic night,
you know.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.511
Oh!
Oh, crap!

01:17.511 --> 01:20.148
You know,
I blame this on you.
Me?

01:20.148 --> 01:21.882
If you hadn't made me
watch every horror film

01:21.882 --> 01:23.484
from the 1970s,
I might have actually

01:23.484 --> 01:25.219
gotten some work done
this week.
Hey.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.554
Not every horror film,
just the devil ones.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.888
You're a bad influence.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.490
Oh, thank you.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.592
Hey, come here,
you got a little on your...

01:31.592 --> 01:33.227
( sighs )

01:33.227 --> 01:34.895
You know, I haven't pulled
an all-nighter since...

01:34.895 --> 01:37.498
Ever. I have never
pulled an all-nighter.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.367
It's good for a
person now and then.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.469
Not for me. I'm used to being
in control of these situations.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.770
What situations?

01:42.770 --> 01:45.406
I'm usually so organized.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.179
Dubenko's going to kill me

01:51.179 --> 01:53.681
if I'm late.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.551
Well, um...

01:57.551 --> 01:59.620
don't worry about the cereal.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.755
( door closes )

02:01.755 --> 02:04.292
It's not about God.
It's about tradition.

02:04.292 --> 02:05.659
Religious tradition.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.295
What's wrong with that?

02:07.295 --> 02:09.663
Nothing, if you're religious,
but I'm not religious.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.864
( sighs )

02:10.864 --> 02:13.401
Okay, you ever
been to a baptism?

02:13.401 --> 02:14.635
Yes, I have.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.503
I thought it was weird.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.804
Weird?
Yes.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.440
The ritualized
spiritual purification of a baby

02:19.440 --> 02:20.908
kind of freaks me out.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.810
You thought that was bad,
you should see a bris.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.646
Hey, Rodney.
Hey, you and you.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.448
I heard the good news.
Congratulations.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.682
Thank you.
Two coffees, please.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.783
You want decaf, right?

02:29.783 --> 02:32.286
No, regular, black.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.322
Look, I was baptized,
so were my brothers,

02:34.322 --> 02:35.723
my cousins, my parents.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.558
Baptism is what we
do in Croatia.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.393
But it's an initiation
into a club

02:39.393 --> 02:40.761
I don't want to belong to.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.596
It would mean a
lot to my father.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.333
Thank you.
Thanks.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.568
Do you know
there's absolutely no evidence

02:47.568 --> 02:49.870
that a moderate amount of
caffeine is harmful to the baby?

02:49.870 --> 02:51.705
The American Academy
of Obstetrics...

02:51.705 --> 02:53.907
Please, stop
changing the subject.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.909
...people feel the need
to curtail my caffeine intake.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.311
Why is that?
It's a little water,

02:57.311 --> 02:58.746
a little prayer,
and a chance

02:58.746 --> 03:00.748
to make a lot of
other people happy.
I don't know.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.316
There's something so...
What?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.651
...so Rosemary's Baby about it.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.501
Victor Clemente.

03:20.501 --> 03:24.572
All these people here
for drug testing, too?

03:24.572 --> 03:26.340
Oh, yeah, you can't
tell me that.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.342
Of course, you
can't tell me that.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.943
Midstream,
in the cup.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.979
All right, thanks.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.914
Sample collection
has to be witnessed.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.917
Come on, I'm not trying
to pull anything fancy.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.686
Sample collection
has to be witnessed.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.888
What are we,
in fascist Germany?

03:42.923 --> 03:44.492
All right, fine.
( zipper whizzing )

03:44.492 --> 03:45.926
Witness this.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.465
It's okay, honey.
You know you want to look.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.588
I have a budget committee
meeting until 9:30.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.056
Page me if you
get a trauma.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.391
Carter called?

04:50.391 --> 04:51.592
Yeah, you were in
with an epistaxis,

04:51.592 --> 04:52.626
whatever the hell
that is.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.395
I didn't want
to bother you.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.929
It's a nosebleed, Frank.
You could have pulled me out.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.798
He said he'd call back,
it didn't seem that important.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.733
If you're not sure,
transfer calls
back to the room.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.701
I'll decide
what's important.

05:00.701 --> 05:01.835
Oh, hey, Luka.
Huh?

05:01.835 --> 05:03.737
Sign Kerry's
card for me.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.406
How is she doing?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.107
Good. A little stir-crazy,
but she's starting rehab soon.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.809
I'm sending her flowers
from her department.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.644
Nice.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.813
Hey, I need someone
to parlez-vous a little EspaÃ±ol.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.014
Inez is off,
Marquez isn't in yet,

05:14.014 --> 05:15.683
and goiter girl
has been waiting an hour

05:15.683 --> 05:16.784
for a Spanish translator.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.552
Get Clemente.
He's back?

05:18.552 --> 05:19.920
Yep, should be.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.390
If he's not here in
ten minutes, call me.

05:22.390 --> 05:25.058
Hey, I heard they sent Clemente
to Atlanta for diversion.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.960
Let's hope.
He's on house arrest.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.629
And they're letting
him come to work?

05:28.629 --> 05:30.030
Some kind
of special arrangement.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.865
Well, it's his first day,
he's already late.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.567
Yeah, ten bucks says
he doesn't show.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.836
Okay, pirate guy
with testicular pain, Ray,

05:35.836 --> 05:37.004
Abby, you get fever-rash,

05:37.004 --> 05:38.506
I will take dog bite to earlobe.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.940
Wait. Switch that.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.475
No, you take dog bite,
I'll take the rash.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.543
It could be rubella.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.911
We wouldn't want
to risk our baby

05:43.911 --> 05:45.413
getting a
torch infection.
What?

05:45.413 --> 05:46.480
Torch infection:
herpes, tox.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.948
I know what
a torch infection is.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.116
Then you know it wouldn't
be good for our baby.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.784
Why do you keep calling it
"our baby?"

05:50.784 --> 05:53.020
I don't mean our baby
like you and me.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.456
I mean like
our baby, right?

05:55.456 --> 05:56.690
Like an ER mascot.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.126
This baby
isn't anyone's mascot.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.128
Good morning.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.432
Bagels, anybody?

06:04.432 --> 06:06.434
Hey. Dr. Clemente.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.801
MAN:
Anybody?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.703
Come on, Morris.
Let's clean the board.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.538
Hello!

06:12.573 --> 06:15.609
I think I've just
committed suicide.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.513
A little stick here.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.782
A gun's certainly the most
reliable method,

06:21.782 --> 06:23.517
but it's kind of
against my politics.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.853
Overdose just seemed like
the way to go.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.021
Slow, tidy, not
a lot of fuss.

06:30.123 --> 06:34.628
I suppose I have to be placed
on three-day hold now.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.898
I don't get it.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.968
If you're trying to die,
why come in at all?

06:40.968 --> 06:43.804
Who wants to die alone?

06:43.804 --> 06:46.940
All right, Mr. Sadler,
we're going to get you

06:46.940 --> 06:48.776
an acetaminophen antidote

06:48.776 --> 06:50.778
and then call a psychiatrist
to talk to you, okay?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.746
That sounds great.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.617
( clears throat )

06:56.617 --> 06:58.051
Yikes.
No kidding.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.753
That's some real
pathology there.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.655
He's so calm it's scary.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.625
More like sociopathic.
( chuckles )

07:04.625 --> 07:06.093
You guys got
one to present?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.228
We're good, Mucomyst, charcoal,
waiting on a tox.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.631
I'll page Psych.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.567
All right.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.769
BARDELLI:
21-year-old, discovered
down in the dorm near UIC.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.970
Multiple stab wounds
to the neck and shoulder.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.672
Vitals?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.741
Pulse: 97, resps: 32,
sat: 93 on six liters.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.009
I came to pick her up
for class

07:22.009 --> 07:23.243
and found her bleeding
on the floor.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.545
Sam, what's open?
( wheezing )

07:24.545 --> 07:25.713
TAGGART:
Trauma One.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.947
CLEMENTE:
Oh, well, well,

07:26.947 --> 07:28.682
if it isn't
the elusive Dr. K.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.851
Okay, Vic, we'll have to catch
up later. Abby, come with us.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.653
Hey, you're busy.
I get it.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.887
KOVAC:
Why don't you stay out
and run the board.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.923
Okay, got it, boss.
What happened?

07:35.923 --> 07:37.725
Knife wound,
lacerated trachea.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.593
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.694
Can you tell
us your name?

07:40.694 --> 07:41.762
( wheezing )
Nimet.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.164
Please... I can't... breathe.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.699
Hang in there.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.568
We're gonna
take care of you.
Frick!

07:47.568 --> 07:48.836
I'm here, Nim.
Everything's going to be okay.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.170
Abby, take the airway.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.605
Sam, get another line.
Ready?

07:51.605 --> 07:53.941
One, two, three.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.108
I'm scared.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.610
FRICK:
Shh. Don't try to talk.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.945
Just let the doctors
take care of you.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.680
Sats only 84.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.182
Zone three stab wounds
with clear tracheal penetration

08:02.182 --> 08:03.951
and an adjacent
pulsatile mass.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.085
The police are here.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.254
How is she doing?
Not right now.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.956
Stridor with what appears to be
an expanding hematoma.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.558
Haleh, can you stay?

08:10.558 --> 08:11.759
Yeah.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.561
You know her?
She's my girlfriend.

08:13.561 --> 08:14.928
I need to take a statement.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.263
Now? Can't this wait?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.932
Just tell them what you can,
won't take long.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.167
TAGGART:
She's hypoventilating.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.635
HALEH:
Her pulse is taking a dive.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.670
LOCKHART:
Nimet?

08:22.670 --> 08:24.071
TAGGART:
Sats only 78.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.573
She was just talking.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.807
What do you guys want?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.776
Okay, uh, 7-5 ET,
mac 2,

08:28.776 --> 08:30.578
etomidate, and SUX.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.011
KOVAC:
No paralytics,
could be a tough intubation.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.014
What, are you trying
to make it tougher?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.783
No, if you can't get the tube,

08:35.783 --> 08:37.684
it's going to be very hard
for you to bag

08:37.684 --> 08:38.652
through a lacerated trachea.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.852
I'll get the tube.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.054
HALEH:
Systolic's 81.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.259
MAN:
Tote bag?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.628
Uh, no, thanks.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.162
That's a wrong answer.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.664
You want this.
Okay.

08:50.664 --> 08:53.333
WOMAN:
19, 20, 22!

08:53.333 --> 08:56.269
Yay!

08:56.269 --> 08:58.238
Come demo the LifeWind.
Free trip to Miami.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.642
Uh, no, thank you.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.011
Um, excuse me.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.613
Can I get a nonfat
latte, please?

09:05.613 --> 09:07.881
Coming up.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.916
You familiar
with the Violet 4000?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.217
Excuse me?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.285
It's a new cataract
emulsifier for use

09:12.285 --> 09:13.320
in the operating room.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.725
Foam?

09:17.725 --> 09:19.326
Never mind.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.994
More cricoid.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.295
I'm pressing as
hard as I can.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.632
Towel roll--
the cords are turning anterior.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.902
Okay, let me get that.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.339
( grunts )

09:32.339 --> 09:33.874
Haleh, suction.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.042
You want suction
or cricoid?

09:35.042 --> 09:36.043
I can't do both.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.344
Let me take a shot.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.679
No, that's all right. I'm in.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.347
I don't think you are.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.716
LOCKHART:
Oh, come on.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.017
HALEH:
Sats only 72.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.218
Abby?

09:45.218 --> 09:46.654
Call surgery.
She needs a trach.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.888
Paged them three
times already.

09:47.888 --> 09:48.889
Page them again.
Heart rate is dropping.

09:48.889 --> 09:49.890
I almost got it.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.793
Damn it.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.127
Where's the defibrillator?
HALEH:
Counter.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.664
KOVAC:
Get ready with atropine.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.732
I got it. It's heavy.
I got it. I'm right here.

09:58.732 --> 09:59.733
TAGGART:
Pulse 23.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.635
Atropine, one mig now.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.904
Starting compressions.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.273
If you want me to jump
in there and do that, I can.
I'm fine.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.041
Yeah, but you don't
have to do that.
All right, enough.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.309
I'm having a baby.
Get over it.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.878
Let me do my job.

10:10.878 --> 10:13.313
Amp of epi,
right away.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.715
MORRIS:
Hey, Ray.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.116
Have you seen the Wood's lamp?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.818
These morgellons are supposed
to be autoflorescent.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.419
What? Are you speaking English?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.354
My patient thinks some
sort of fiber-producing bug

10:21.354 --> 10:22.790
is crawling on her.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.324
She brought some
in a jar.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.859
It's lint.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.095
No, it's fibers produced
by the morgellons.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.663
Delusional parasitism.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.732
DC home with a referral
for counseling.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.966
I thought there might be
some therapeutic benefit

10:32.966 --> 10:34.301
to looking at this
under the scope.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.869
Make her feel I'm taking
her complaint seriously.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.705
Morris, it's schmootz, okay?
It's schmootz.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.973
Spend your time on patients that
you could actually help, okay?

10:41.842 --> 10:44.111
Hey, guys, guys,
okay, look.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.880
I know my time off
left you shorthanded.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.783
Hey, no worries.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.151
Okay, I'm sensing...

10:51.151 --> 10:52.853
Look, if there's anything
you want to ask,

10:52.853 --> 10:54.287
anything you want
to get off your chest,

10:54.287 --> 10:55.923
anything you want to say...
It's all good, really.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.324
MARQUEZ:
Crushing chest pain. Need a doc.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.027
Exam three's open.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.394
Holy crap,
it's like I'm in a vise.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.830
Vitals?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.965
Pulse: 92, BP: 110/65.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.299
Five of MS.
Let's get him on O2.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.300
You forgot the 12 lead.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.836
Yeah, I was
getting to that.

11:08.836 --> 11:09.903
Aspirin, oxygen,
beta-blockers, morphine.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.004
It's cookbook.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.740
Somebody say morphine?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.074
Call the cath lab.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.009
Yeah. This isn't
our first MI.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.049
Any word from surgery?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.350
Trauma's still in
with the liver lac.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.753
What about cardiothoracic?
Did you try them?

11:25.753 --> 11:27.420
Yeah, they're doing a
triple-A that choppered
in from Mercy.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.122
What, and that's
all we have in-house?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.758
Big surgical conference
this week.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.259
Skeleton crews
at all the hospitals in town.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.493
Here's your tube.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.428
Come on, Nimet.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.800
Abby, your GI bleeder is
altered, and the crit fell to 9.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.301
All right, two
units of O-neg,

11:41.301 --> 11:43.103
and tell GI to scope him
him before he codes.
Okay.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.504
Guy needs
central access.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.106
Go ahead.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.240
I mean, if you want.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.043
We're okay here.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.511
HALEH:
Sats are coming up.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.080
KOVAC:
Hold compressions.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.414
TAGGART:
Back in sinus, 72.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.317
Is she going to be all right?

11:57.317 --> 12:00.020
This tube is helping her
breathe right now,

12:00.020 --> 12:02.823
but she's going to need surgery
on her airway.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.157
Have we tried
head and neck service?

12:04.157 --> 12:07.360
I'll give them a call.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.529
The girl's mom
and brother are here.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.998
Oh, Nimet...

12:10.998 --> 12:12.833
( speaks foreign language )

12:14.301 --> 12:15.302
I'm Dr. Kovac.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.307
What's he doing here?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.242
Hey, let's just be cool,
all right?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.310
Get out!

12:23.310 --> 12:24.477
Mahir, calm down!

12:24.477 --> 12:27.047
Get the hell off of me!

12:27.047 --> 12:28.882
Settle down, guys!

12:28.882 --> 12:30.150
Settle down!
Guys, settle down! Hey!

12:34.454 --> 12:35.823
How dare you come here?

12:35.823 --> 12:36.924
You're not family.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.358
Stay away from my sister!

12:38.358 --> 12:41.862
Please, for Nimet's sake,
show some respect.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.067
How's your
first day back going?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.268
It's great. Well, good.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.469
Really, really good.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.438
My day pretty much sucks.
Oh, yeah?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.506
I pretty much lost it
in a code this morning.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.243
Isn't it a funny thing that,
one minute, your whole life,

12:56.243 --> 12:59.079
everything is in order, and then
wham, this split-second event,

12:59.079 --> 13:00.948
and the whole thing just starts
to spin around, you know?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.415
Yeah, I know.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.051
I know exactly what you're
talking about because...

13:04.051 --> 13:05.418
People at work,
I mean, they see

13:05.418 --> 13:07.020
this tiny sliver
of what you're about,

13:07.020 --> 13:09.289
and then they just make it
all about that one thing.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.258
I know. They jump to all
sorts of conclusions...

13:11.258 --> 13:13.326
Right, right, 'cause they don't
know what I'm going through.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.995
And they're making
all these assumptions,

13:14.995 --> 13:16.864
but they're only seeing
what they want to see.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.104
RIZA:
Why must men always
resort to violence

13:24.104 --> 13:26.539
to settle their differences?

13:26.539 --> 13:29.142
My son idolizes his sister.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.544
But he's never liked
this boyfriend of hers.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.615
Our surgical team is working

13:35.615 --> 13:37.350
on another critical patient
right now,

13:37.350 --> 13:41.088
but Nimet is next.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.190
Trauma room.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.424
Yeah, this is she.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.895
Yeah, who's this?

13:47.895 --> 13:50.297
Yo, where the hell
do you get off calling me here?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.265
I'm working, idiot!

13:54.101 --> 13:56.303
Uh, since when do we get
personal calls

13:56.303 --> 13:57.604
transferred back
to the trauma rooms?

13:57.604 --> 14:00.007
I'm sorry.
That might be my fault.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.108
Everything okay?

14:03.376 --> 14:05.112
Yeah, nothing winning
the lottery couldn't help.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.579
Sorry about that.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.916
I'm going to clean
your son's cuts now.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.050
Thank you.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.520
Don't worry, kuchuk hanem.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.922
I won't leave

14:14.922 --> 14:16.990
until we can walk
out together.

14:21.328 --> 14:24.264
Her name Nimet,
it means "blessing."

14:24.264 --> 14:26.399
That's lovely.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.105
Her father called her Madame
Curie because when she was born,

14:32.105 --> 14:34.307
she was looking at us
so intensely,

14:34.307 --> 14:37.444
like she was studying
her parents.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.013
We thought she might grow
up to be a scientist.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.648
Is he coming in?

14:41.648 --> 14:44.184
He died when Nimet was five.

14:45.685 --> 14:49.089
He was a reporter
for the newspaper.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.524
Kidnapped and shot
by the Turkish Hezbollah

14:51.524 --> 14:54.962
while I was pregnant
with Mahir.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.629
I had to leave.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.166
Had to raise my children
in a country

14:59.166 --> 15:02.435
where they wouldn't be killed
for speaking the truth.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.407
I understand.

15:07.407 --> 15:11.178
I only spoke a few words
of English when we arrived.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.314
I had to work
two jobs.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.716
I know how that is,

15:16.716 --> 15:19.252
trying to adjust, to fit in.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.654
It was worth it.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.556
She thrived.

15:23.556 --> 15:27.360
Earned a full
scholarship at UIC.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.997
Journalism, like her father.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.332
You've done well
by your children.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.136
I've tried.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.472
DUBENKO:
Neela.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.045
"The Utility of
the Seatbelt Sign

15:45.045 --> 15:46.146
in Predicting
Mediastinal Injury."

15:46.146 --> 15:47.214
"Neela Rasgotra, M.D."

15:47.214 --> 15:49.649
3:00 p.m.
in the Sunflower Room.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.219
Sunflower Room--
sounds happy.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.021
Holds 200 people.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.522
There's a lot of interest
in your talk.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.524
Lucian, hello!

15:57.524 --> 15:59.126
Tim, hi, nice to see you.
How you doing?

15:59.126 --> 16:01.028
Love to catch up,
but I've got to go mediate

16:01.028 --> 16:03.030
the trauma panel.
Oh, yeah.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.464
Looks like an interesting group
this year.
Very.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.333
And wait.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.036
Now, why aren't
you on it?

16:09.036 --> 16:10.437
That's weird.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.240
Too bad.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.242
Timothy Weisner.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.144
Remember when I said there's
always one ass in the audience

16:17.144 --> 16:18.678
who's determined
to look smarter than you?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.080
He's that guy.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.214
You have his paper, right?

16:21.214 --> 16:22.449
'Cause he's gonna
ask you about it.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.616
Okay.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.652
Yeah, not enough love
in the sandbox.

16:25.652 --> 16:30.057
Needs to hear his own work
cited in other people's talks.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.059
Relax. You'll be fine.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.660
I played a tangerine

16:33.660 --> 16:35.628
in the Christmas play
in primary school.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.064
Lost my footing and
rolled off the stage.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.265
I'm having flashbacks.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.133
Just relax.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.070
Read your slides,
don't go too fast, and...

16:43.070 --> 16:45.105
well, memorize table three
of the Weisner paper,

16:45.105 --> 16:47.274
and you'll do just fine.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.076
Oh, I bought you this.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.377
Take one of these.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.079
It's a beta-blocker.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.313
It's okay. I always
take one before I talk.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.282
Takes the edge off
the catecholamines.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.490
I told you, over-golding
is hazardous to your health.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.691
Your skin's never
going to heal

17:04.691 --> 17:06.193
if you don't give it
a chance to air out.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.660
I did like you said.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.097
I kept it off for a week.
Make it a month this time.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.499
Hey, Ray, Neela called.
Said it was urgent.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.567
Okay, another week of Keflex,
and give the bling a break.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.269
I got to be me, man.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.804
Yeah.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.472
Hey, Neela wants you
to go to her locker

17:19.472 --> 17:21.174
and find
the Weisner paper

17:21.174 --> 17:22.809
in the February 2005 issue
of Trauma Annals

17:22.809 --> 17:24.511
and fax it to her
at this number.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.744
She said you'd know
the combination,

17:25.744 --> 17:26.579
and you'd know
what it's about.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.814
I do and I do.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.549
And she said that
if you do this,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.284
she'll watch any '70s
movie you want tonight,

17:31.284 --> 17:33.553
even the extended version
of Dawn of the Dead.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.488
And this came back
on your overdose.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.589
You sure this is right?

17:36.589 --> 17:39.559
I even had them
repeat it.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.761
How you feeling,
Mr. Sadler?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.596
About the same.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.533
But I suppose I won't feel much
until most of the liver dies.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.201
That's not gonna happen.

17:48.201 --> 17:51.204
Your acetaminophen level
is almost undetectable.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.873
Strange, I know
that's what I took.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.509
Could there have been
anything else in the bottle?

17:56.509 --> 17:59.412
No.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.148
But that doesn't change
the course of action, right?

18:01.148 --> 18:03.383
I mean, you still have
to keep me on a hold.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.318
At least until
psychiatry sees you, yeah.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.587
Yeah, that makes sense.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.788
So what happened in there?

18:08.788 --> 18:10.523
Nothing.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.524
That wasn't nothing.

18:15.162 --> 18:18.265
She shouldn't be
with someone like that.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.400
He seems like
an okay enough guy to me.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.801
He's a jerk.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.337
He lives in Dorch.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.638
It's the jock dorm.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.210
Something bad happened there
last term.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.678
What do you mean something bad?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.515
A girl got gang-raped.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.817
It was in the news.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.353
They never figured out
who did it.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.255
And you think
Frick was involved?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.591
They all knew what was going on.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.826
I'll be right back.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.467
Where's the boyfriend?

18:54.467 --> 18:57.904
Uh, staying away for now,
out of respect for the family.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.640
Yeah, brother doesn't think
he's such a good guy.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.210
Well, I'm sure the police are
investigating all possibilities.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.281
The phone call before...

19:08.281 --> 19:10.383
Ah, it's nothing.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.618
Uh, surgery's still tied up?

19:11.618 --> 19:14.487
Yeah.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.789
Anything I can do?

19:16.789 --> 19:20.427
No, I... I enrolled Alex
in this tutoring program

19:20.427 --> 19:23.263
where they, you know,
help him with his homework

19:23.263 --> 19:24.931
in the afternoons, and they
keep him out of trouble.

19:24.931 --> 19:25.932
That sounds good.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.700
Yeah.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.969
Except for you have to pay
for the whole term up front.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.605
So I maxed out my Visa
and now...

19:32.605 --> 19:35.642
I'm a little late
on our rent.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.943
Do you, do you need...

19:36.943 --> 19:38.345
No, it's okay.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.612
We're fine.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.348
We're gonna be okay.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.750
But thanks.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.591
This thing has been transmitting
for 20 minutes.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.792
Is this normal?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.261
The machine is archaic.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.263
It prints on rolls
instead of sheets,

19:56.263 --> 19:58.265
and forget about confirming
if it's been received.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.832
This is just
press and pray.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.601
Yeah, right.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.703
Okay, could you send this
from the department office?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.438
It's important.
Something wrong
with your feet?

20:05.438 --> 20:06.539
I'm not
your personal secretary.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.874
Frank, please.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.509
I have six patients
ready to dispo,

20:09.509 --> 20:11.378
and I haven't presented
any of them yet.
Fine.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.679
I'll have a turkey club
for lunch, thank you.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.247
Thank you.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.283
Hey, you need to present?

20:16.283 --> 20:17.717
Ah, that's okay.
That's cool.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.951
What do you mean?

20:18.951 --> 20:21.621
I just heard you say
you needed to present.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.790
Right, and I already
started with Kovac,

20:23.790 --> 20:26.526
so I'll just
wait for him.

20:26.526 --> 20:30.830
Okay. Okay.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.332
X-Ray, I'm not feeling
the love, man.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.333
What's the problem?

20:33.333 --> 20:34.567
No problem.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.336
No, no, seriously,
what's the deal?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.804
What's going on?
I don't know
what you mean.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.472
Yeah, you do.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.541
I mean, you've been giving me
attitude all day, man.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.576
It's getting a little old,
frankly, okay?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.845
I mean, so what, I had
a messy situation with a girl.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.347
And that's all it was, okay?

20:47.347 --> 20:48.981
Can we leave it in the past?
Hey, hey, hey.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.018
Your personal life, it's
your business, okay, man?

20:52.018 --> 20:53.886
Oh, so you want to know
the whole story, huh?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.388
Mm.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.457
Okay, here it is, here it is.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.759
I had the weekend off,
went a little crazy.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.728
There was some weed.
There was some blow, okay?

21:01.728 --> 21:02.762
Come on, man, you're a musician.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.796
You know what it's like.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.432
No, actually, I don't.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.833
So, what, are you
in a Christian band?

21:08.968 --> 21:10.503
Just forget it, okay?

21:10.503 --> 21:12.372
No, no, I'm not gonna
let you forget it

21:12.372 --> 21:13.606
'cause let me
tell you something.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.041
I want you to know
that I never

21:15.041 --> 21:16.809
showed up to work
high once, okay?

21:16.809 --> 21:17.710
Not once, you
understand?

21:17.710 --> 21:19.946
Want a medal for that?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.814
Where do you get off being
so self-righteous, man?

21:21.814 --> 21:23.015
I've seen you
stumble out of Ike's

21:23.015 --> 21:24.651
plenty of times, okay?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.586
So, what, it's cool to
be obliterated on EtOH,

21:26.586 --> 21:28.655
but you change the chemical,
all of a sudden, I'm a scumbag?

21:28.655 --> 21:30.857
You're right.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.525
It's not fair.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.628
Listen, let's me and you get
something straight, okay?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.630
I've been evaluated by the
Impaired Physicians Committee.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.432
And you know what?
I'm in the clear.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.933
And whether you like it or
not, I'm back at County,

21:40.933 --> 21:42.469
I'm your attending,

21:42.469 --> 21:44.371
and you better start
showing me some respect.

21:44.371 --> 21:46.439
Now take this history,
examine that patient,

21:46.439 --> 21:48.808
and present to me in ten,
you got it?!

21:52.512 --> 21:54.514
( sighs )

21:56.115 --> 21:58.485
Well, he's definitely got some
some axis two stuff going on,

21:58.485 --> 22:00.453
but he's not actively suicidal.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.389
I'm sending him home.
You're kidding.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.856
No, he's a negative
tox screen,

22:03.856 --> 22:05.792
doesn't seem to have
any plan to it try again.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.093
It's a la casa,
bye-bye.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.695
Whoa, you're comfortable
discharging him?

22:08.695 --> 22:10.430
No, not exactly,

22:10.430 --> 22:12.599
but the psych ward is full
and I can't hold him.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.066
I'll put
a formal consult
in the chart.

22:14.066 --> 22:15.802
Excuse me?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.604
You'll refer him for
outpatient counseling
at least.

22:17.604 --> 22:18.871
Sure, but the next
available appointment

22:18.871 --> 22:19.972
is in 14 weeks.

22:21.908 --> 22:22.709
Excuse me, sir?

22:25.412 --> 22:27.614
What can I do for you,
little lady?

22:27.614 --> 22:29.649
We're looking for a doctor
named Archibald Morris.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.017
And who is "we?"

22:36.656 --> 22:38.591
KOVAC:
Okay, type and cross
the thalassemia kid,

22:38.591 --> 22:40.593
and I want post-reduction films
on the tib/fib

22:40.593 --> 22:41.628
before the ketamine
wears off.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.629
You got it.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.133
So. How's it going?

22:48.835 --> 22:49.802
Oh, it's going great.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.604
Going real great.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.873
You know, I just want to
thank you for making the effort

22:53.873 --> 22:55.107
and easing my re-entry.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.710
Good to have
you back, Vic.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.612
Glad to hear it, because
if I didn't know better,

22:59.612 --> 23:00.913
I would have thought
you're trying to avoiding me.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.048
I'm not avoiding you.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.516
I've been bouncing all day

23:03.516 --> 23:05.485
between patients
and administrative crap.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.454
Budget committee, admission...

23:07.454 --> 23:08.755
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're important.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.956
I get it. I get it.

23:09.956 --> 23:10.990
Look, sorry
we didn't roll out

23:10.990 --> 23:12.124
the red carpet
for you today...

23:12.124 --> 23:13.125
Nimet's tanking again.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.597
Right.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.968
Can't get the sat above 80,

23:21.968 --> 23:23.035
and she's getting
really hard to bag.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.471
Okay, suction.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.738
Zone three stab wound
to the neck.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.973
Systolic's
only 72.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.575
Will someone
explain, please?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.743
I can't ventilate
at all.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.945
Hematoma's expanding.
It's dislodged the tube.

23:32.945 --> 23:33.980
All right,
let's crike her.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.047
No, no,
too dangerous.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.649
Lesion is low,
if we cut into it,

23:36.649 --> 23:37.717
she can bleed out.

23:37.717 --> 23:38.885
Good point.
Good point.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.052
All right,
let's go to Plan B.

23:40.052 --> 23:40.920
Sam, call
the perfusion team.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.489
What?

23:42.489 --> 23:43.155
Heart rate's dropping
into the 50s.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.824
What does that mean?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.693
We're going to put in
a cardiopulmonary bypass.

23:46.693 --> 23:47.827
You need an OR
and a surgeon for that,

23:47.827 --> 23:48.995
and we don't have either.

23:48.995 --> 23:49.929
We're going
to cannulate
down here

23:49.929 --> 23:51.030
and we'll bypass ourselves.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.665
You can't do that.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.901
If we work quickly,
we can get her on the machine

23:54.901 --> 23:56.536
before she suffers
permanent hypoxic damage.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.169
Go get the resident.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.505
I'll find Abby.

23:58.505 --> 23:59.939
Tell me
what's happening!

23:59.939 --> 24:01.240
The bleeding is blocking
her airway.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.675
We can't get enough oxygen
into her blood.

24:02.675 --> 24:03.876
Oh, God.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.545
( speaking Turkish )

24:05.545 --> 24:07.179
KOVAC:
We'll get her on
the heart-lung machine

24:07.179 --> 24:09.716
so we can buy more time before
we can get into an OR, okay?

24:09.716 --> 24:11.250
Whatever you think
is right.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.752
Brady to 45,
lost the pulse!

24:12.752 --> 24:13.953
Starting compressions.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.655
Mahir, you should
wait outside.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.656
Mom...
Go.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.159
Nimet, Nimet...

24:20.159 --> 24:23.730
You're a strong girl.
You're a brave girl.

24:23.730 --> 24:27.133
Don't leave me.
Don't give up.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.969
Okay, what's this about, kids?
I'm a doctor, very busy.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.071
You're Archibald Morris?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.574
Yeah.
What do you need?

24:34.574 --> 24:35.842
You better have a seat.

24:37.777 --> 24:38.911
( sighs )

24:38.911 --> 24:40.647
Here's the deal:

24:40.647 --> 24:41.948
we four live with
different parents,

24:41.948 --> 24:43.282
but we all share
the same dad.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.717
BOY:
We're not supposed
to be able

24:44.717 --> 24:46.719
to find out the identity
of our father.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.054
But the Donor
Sibling Registry

24:48.054 --> 24:48.988
allows us
to find out

24:48.988 --> 24:50.557
the identity of each other.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.058
So, I got in contact with
all of them via e-mail,

24:52.058 --> 24:53.826
and it actually turns out

24:53.826 --> 24:56.295
that little Max here is
actually a computer genius.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.830
What's up?

24:57.830 --> 24:59.165
GIRL 2:
He hacked into
the system

24:59.165 --> 25:00.567
at the sperm bank

25:00.567 --> 25:01.701
and found
our father's name:

25:01.701 --> 25:03.035
"Archibald Morris."

25:03.035 --> 25:04.704
GIRL:
So... are you
donor 140

25:04.704 --> 25:07.774
from the Chicago
Cryo Bank?

25:07.774 --> 25:09.308
Huh?

25:09.308 --> 25:11.811
Did you donate any sperm
between 1991 and 1996?

25:11.811 --> 25:13.279
( scoffs ):
Did I ever.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.291
Oh, my God.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.259
I'm... I'm your daddy.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.997
Mr. Sadler.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.632
Being a sitter
for crazy people

25:32.632 --> 25:34.133
seems like a really
boring job.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.302
Well, guess what,
Barry?

25:36.302 --> 25:37.770
You and the sitter
can both go home.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.938
What?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.239
You convinced
the psychiatrist

25:40.239 --> 25:41.708
that it's safe
to discharge you.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.910
No.
You're free to go.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.945
Well, well...
what about these?

25:45.945 --> 25:48.881
Mr. Sadler, you took what,
three, maybe four pills?

25:48.881 --> 25:49.882
Two.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.084
Two.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.620
But-but a gesture
is a gesture.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.854
I was suicidal
when I did it.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.623
The psychiatrist
is convinced

25:56.623 --> 25:57.624
you're not going
to try it again.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.025
What if I'm homicidal?

25:59.025 --> 26:00.893
You have to keep me here
if I'm homicidal,

26:00.893 --> 26:01.861
if I want to kill people.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.730
Barry...

26:03.730 --> 26:04.731
what's going on?

26:06.899 --> 26:10.369
The thing is...

26:10.369 --> 26:11.971
I, uh...

26:11.971 --> 26:13.673
I need to stay here.

26:13.673 --> 26:14.807
I can't go home
this weekend.

26:14.807 --> 26:15.742
Why not?

26:15.742 --> 26:17.009
I just can't.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.646
You're going to have to do
better than that.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.054
I'm in love with
my best friend's girl.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.223
It happens.
You'll get over it.

26:31.223 --> 26:32.792
They're getting
married tomorrow.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.795
I don't trust myself
not to...

26:35.795 --> 26:36.796
To what?

26:36.796 --> 26:38.831
Object.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.099
Or worse.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.303
Lock me up till
the wedding's over, please.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.040
I'm begging you.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.379
I'll talk to psych again.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.847
See what I can do.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.952
Barry.

26:59.952 --> 27:00.953
Does she know?

27:00.953 --> 27:02.689
Who, Helen?

27:02.689 --> 27:04.323
Yeah.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.125
Have you told her
how you feel?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.359
God, no.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.360
That would be crazy.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.032
Still in PEA.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.233
Resuming compressions.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.234
It's okay, Nimet.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.402
It's going to be
all right.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.170
Got a flash.
Introducer.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.171
Have you ever
done this before?

27:19.171 --> 27:20.306
Nope.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.307
All right,
give us some room.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.341
Give us some room. Come on.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.209
I'll be right here.

27:23.209 --> 27:24.977
Just listen to my voice.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.079
LOCKHART:
This seems a little
unconventional.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.115
Okay, fine.
What's the alternative?

27:29.115 --> 27:31.117
LOCKHART:
Somebody call
surgery again.

27:31.117 --> 27:33.419
KOVAC:
They were still working in
an open chest five minutes ago.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.755
Did I tell you
Mrs. Kalter's daughter

27:35.755 --> 27:37.724
has 14 bridesmaids
in her wedding?

27:37.724 --> 27:38.925
This is gonna work.
We'll oxygenate her blood
till surgery's ready.

27:38.925 --> 27:40.793
It's gonna be awesome.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.795
Yeah, if she
doesn't bleed out
from all the heparin.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.197
Threading easily.
Nine yards of silk organza
for each dress.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.866
Hook me up, Lockhart.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.434
Does surgery even know
we're doing this?

27:48.434 --> 27:49.235
( sighs ):
They're not available.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.436
We can't wait.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.838
Silk flowers
all around her neck.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.005
You must get better

27:53.005 --> 27:55.007
so you can help me
with the embroidery.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.743
pH only 7.02.

27:56.743 --> 27:57.910
Yeah, well, we got
nothing to lose.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.179
KOVAC:
Okay, good flush.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.380
MOTHER:
You are such

28:01.380 --> 28:02.882
a good girl,
such a help to me.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.416
SAM:
Sats hanging
in the 60s.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.418
Come on. Come on. This is
taking too long. Come on.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.419
O-silk.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.322
Okay.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.891
Unclamping venous.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.133
CLEMENTE:
Unclamping arterial.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.071
Ready.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.239
Okay, mark the time.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.446
Okay, pump is on.
Four liters per minute.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.448
Okay, you can stop.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.326
Color's better already.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.360
CLEMENTE:
Full flow, baby.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.996
Sweet! Ha-ha!

28:49.996 --> 28:51.964
Sats coming up: 92.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.365
Is it working?

28:53.365 --> 28:56.035
Her oxygen level
is improving, yes.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.405
Thank you. Thank you
for saving my daughter.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.406
( sobbing )

29:03.342 --> 29:06.846
RASGOTRA:
Up to 15% of all deaths

29:06.846 --> 29:10.382
following motor vehicle
collisions are caused

29:10.382 --> 29:12.451
by injury to the thoracic aorta.

29:16.022 --> 29:17.056
I...

29:17.890 --> 29:20.092
Uh...

29:20.092 --> 29:25.464
We... set out to document
the incidence and...

29:25.464 --> 29:29.902
utility of the seatbelt sign
in predicting...

29:31.838 --> 29:32.839
( clears throat )

29:39.111 --> 29:41.513
Is there anyone from
audiovisual support here?

29:44.516 --> 29:46.352
( crashing and splattering )

29:46.352 --> 29:49.889
PROTESTERS:
Unseen they suffer!
Unheard they cry!

29:49.889 --> 29:53.325
In agony they linger!
Alone they die!

29:53.325 --> 29:56.495
( chanting ):
Rats have rights!
Rats have rights!

29:56.495 --> 29:57.529
RASGOTRA:
I would just
like to point out...

29:57.529 --> 29:58.597
Rats have rights!

29:58.597 --> 30:00.867
...that our study
didn't involve

30:00.867 --> 30:03.235
any rats!

30:03.235 --> 30:06.172
PROTESTERS ( chanting ):
Rats have rights!
Rats have rights!

30:06.172 --> 30:11.110
Rats have rights!
Rats have rights!

30:14.280 --> 30:15.614
Ray!
Meet my kids.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.183
Your what?

30:17.183 --> 30:18.117
Yeah, I needed some
extra cash in college,

30:18.117 --> 30:19.418
donated to a sperm bank.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.854
Best job I ever had,
by the way.
I'm Hana.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.455
My eldest.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.925
Stole her mom's car and drove
60 miles without a license

30:25.925 --> 30:27.393
to get everybody here.

30:27.393 --> 30:30.629
Michael is the regional Dance
Dance Revolution champion,

30:30.629 --> 30:32.865
Melia is a professional
jump roper,

30:32.865 --> 30:34.466
and my boy, Max,
is a computer whiz.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.467
What's up?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.336
It's nice to meet you all.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.039
Yeah, I'm just
giving the tour.
Okay.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.942
All right.
These are the trauma rooms.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.377
Okay? This is where
Daddy saves lives.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.645
Abby.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.181
Come meet
my children.
Not now, Morris.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.182
Okay, she hates kids.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.151
How's she doing?

30:52.151 --> 30:53.920
Stable for now.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.054
Where'd
the family go?

30:55.054 --> 30:56.488
I made them go get
something to eat.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.124
It's going to be
a long night.
Yeah.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.529
Uh, okay, I kind of
snapped this morning.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.031
It's okay.
It's hormones.

31:05.031 --> 31:07.666
No, I hate that excuse.
I just...

31:07.666 --> 31:09.301
I just want to say that

31:09.301 --> 31:11.137
I know you're trying
to help, and I apologize.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.138
Apology accepted.

31:13.605 --> 31:14.373
It's just...

31:14.373 --> 31:15.241
( sighs )

31:15.241 --> 31:16.943
strange being pregnant.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.344
It's so weird having such
a personal thing be so public.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.317
Well, for me,
being pregnant

31:25.317 --> 31:27.319
was something everyone
was ashamed of.

31:27.319 --> 31:30.156
My parents didn't want me
to leave the house.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.358
I think it's nice
that everybody

31:32.358 --> 31:35.027
wants to share
in this with you.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.037
Luka!

31:47.339 --> 31:49.375
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.977
MOTHER:
Please, tell us
what's happening.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.578
Seventh unit, platelets,
and FFP going up.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.246
Wide open at the femoral.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.448
Somebody, explain.
What has gone wrong?

31:56.448 --> 31:57.984
Heparin's off,
right?

31:57.984 --> 31:59.218
The heparin's off,
right?!
It's off!

31:59.218 --> 32:00.419
Okay, one gram
of protamine.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.521
MOTHER:
Please, you have
to help her!

32:02.521 --> 32:04.056
Can't get her mean
above 30.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.592
She's losing blood faster
than we can put it in.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.227
In order to put Nimet
on this machine,

32:08.227 --> 32:09.261
we had to give her
a medicine

32:09.261 --> 32:10.997
that thins her blood.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.498
A possible side effect of
that is internal bleeding.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.366
We think that might be
what's happening right now.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.535
If you stop the medicine,
she'll be okay?

32:16.535 --> 32:17.403
That's what
we're hoping, yes.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.404
SAM:
Whoa.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.238
Acidotic, 6.8.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.443
CLEMENTE:
All right,
one amp of bicarb

32:24.443 --> 32:25.577
and one gram calcium.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.079
Let's go. Let's go.
Go! Go! Go!

32:27.079 --> 32:29.015
Pupils are fixed
and dilated.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.016
No corneal,
no gag.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.417
Why? There's no
head trauma,

32:31.417 --> 32:32.751
and there's no reason
for spontaneous bleed.

32:32.751 --> 32:35.321
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

32:35.321 --> 32:37.456
can cause acute
intracranial
hemorrhage.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.525
She's been on heparin
for less than an hour, okay?

32:39.525 --> 32:41.493
It doesn't make sense.
Does it make sense to you?

32:41.493 --> 32:42.494
Check the oxygenator!

32:42.494 --> 32:44.030
Get another ACT!

32:44.030 --> 32:45.197
SAM:
Volume's too low.
No flow.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.632
( brother praying in Arabic )

32:46.632 --> 32:48.500
She's lost some very basic
neurologic reflexes.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.169
( continues praying )
What does that mean?

32:50.169 --> 32:52.138
We think that she's bled
into her brain.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.440
Stop, Mahir. I can't
hear the doctors!

32:54.440 --> 32:55.441
You can fix this?

33:01.180 --> 33:02.314
No, we can't.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.783
( resumes praying )

33:04.783 --> 33:06.318
CLEMENTE:
Her brain is gone,

33:06.318 --> 33:07.786
and as soon as we turn
that machine off,

33:07.786 --> 33:09.788
her body's going
to die, too.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.790
( praying forcefully )
Come back!

33:11.790 --> 33:15.061
Nimet is strong!
She can fight!

33:15.061 --> 33:16.495
Stop, Mahir!
Stop right now!

33:16.495 --> 33:18.364
This never would have happened
if she stayed home!

33:18.364 --> 33:20.232
You should have
made her stay!
Enough!

33:20.232 --> 33:21.633
Please! There must be

33:21.633 --> 33:24.436
another machine
or something!
I'm sorry.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.473
I'm sorry.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.075
I'll give my own blood...

33:44.090 --> 33:45.357
It was a good
idea, Vic.

33:48.094 --> 33:51.230
Yeah. Yeah,
if it had worked, right?

33:51.230 --> 33:53.665
You gave her the only
chance she ever had.

33:53.665 --> 33:56.235
Yeah. Yeah.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.741
DUBENKO:
I'm sorry
about the beta-blocker.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.411
Ten milligrams
was probably a bit much.

34:05.411 --> 34:07.546
The fainting part just
makes for a better story.

34:07.546 --> 34:12.284
You know, I once ate
a hash brownie

34:12.284 --> 34:15.121
before giving a big talk
in Amsterdam.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.588
I mistakenly thought

34:16.588 --> 34:18.657
that it would take an hour
to kick in.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.293
Suddenly,
I was up on a stage,

34:21.293 --> 34:24.130
completely out of my head,

34:24.130 --> 34:26.297
lecturing to a roomful
of biochemists

34:26.297 --> 34:27.799
in a faux French accent.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.268
Okay.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.536
I feel better.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.704
You know, today was
a complete disaster,

34:32.704 --> 34:34.206
but at least I didn't
bring it on myself.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.141
No, no, no, no.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.809
No, you were the victim

34:37.809 --> 34:43.282
of a truly astounding confluence
of technical problems,

34:43.282 --> 34:46.752
miscalculated pharmaceuticals
and rat activists.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.654
As crazy as that sounds,

34:48.654 --> 34:50.822
that's totally in sync
with my life at the moment.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.491
Your life sounds
pretty interesting.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.560
Oh, no.

34:54.560 --> 34:59.165
I know I may appear to be this
kind of wild, spontaneous girl

34:59.165 --> 35:01.500
who plans a wedding in a day
and sits here getting drunk

35:01.500 --> 35:02.868
with her attending
in a hotel bar,

35:02.868 --> 35:04.903
but I'm not.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.705
I'm boring.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.541
Really boring.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.344
All I want to do is
hang out at home
with my roommate.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.547
Your roommate?
Dr. Barnett?

35:15.547 --> 35:17.283
Yeah. Ray.

35:17.283 --> 35:18.717
Well, that's nice.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.453
It's good the two of you
get along so well.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.223
Yeah, we do.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.392
Maybe that's
what I need.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.727
I was thinking
of getting a dog,

35:28.727 --> 35:32.764
but a roommate's probably
easier to house-train.

35:32.764 --> 35:36.402
You ready
for another round?

35:36.402 --> 35:38.470
Ah, no. No, thank you.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.805
I, uh...

35:39.805 --> 35:42.774
I should get going.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.550
It was worth a try.

35:51.550 --> 35:54.653
Yeah.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.688
I need to go over
organ donation

35:56.688 --> 35:58.824
and explain about
the coroner.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.292
I don't want to rush her.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.261
No, of course not.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.396
This might take a while.

36:04.396 --> 36:07.233
Maybe you should go home.
Don't wait for me.

36:07.233 --> 36:09.468
Um...

36:09.468 --> 36:12.671
I've been thinking, and if it's
that important to your family,

36:12.671 --> 36:15.441
I'm fine with the baptism.

36:17.643 --> 36:20.579
A little holy water
never hurt anybody, right?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.496
Well, Archie, this was fun.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.764
I'm glad we came.

36:38.764 --> 36:39.998
Wait.

36:39.998 --> 36:41.667
You're not leaving, are you?

36:41.667 --> 36:44.470
I was gonna take you all out
for burgers and shakes.

36:44.470 --> 36:47.005
Sorry, can't. I've got to get
everyone home before 8:00

36:47.005 --> 36:47.973
or our parents
will start to worry.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.975
Well...

36:49.975 --> 36:52.578
I mean, what's next?

36:52.578 --> 36:55.013
I wanna take you
guys to ball games,

36:55.013 --> 36:57.549
Millennium Park, movies
your parents won't let you see.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.917
There's just so much.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.519
Perhaps.

37:00.519 --> 37:03.289
We're all pretty busy,
and I don't know when

37:03.289 --> 37:04.890
I'll be able to steal
my mom's car again, so...

37:04.890 --> 37:07.326
Somebody hid the digital
on the code cart.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.461
Ooh, great, Frank.
Thank you.

37:09.461 --> 37:10.996
Come here, I want
to take a picture.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.931
Really, we gotta run.
Please. Two seconds.
Come on.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.966
Please.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.935
Okay, everyone say, "freak."

37:32.818 --> 37:34.920
Samantha.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.988
Hey.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.690
I'm glad you called.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.362
Where's all your stuff?

37:43.362 --> 37:48.600
Oh, I thought we were going
to conduct an interview first.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.670
I thought we already did.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.444
( sizzling )

37:58.444 --> 38:00.946
( door opening )

38:00.946 --> 38:02.581
Hey, how was it?

38:02.581 --> 38:04.783
Endless.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.917
Well, I'm making us
stir-fry.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.886
Beer or wine?
Neither.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.821
I'm exhausted
and already drunk.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.957
All right, here,

38:11.957 --> 38:13.525
taste this.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.760
Freshwater chestnut.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.364
Crazy, huh?

38:18.364 --> 38:19.731
Thought they grew
in cans.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.633
All right, well,
I rented The Omen,

38:21.633 --> 38:23.569
and I was too scared
to watch it alone.

38:23.569 --> 38:25.003
Ray...

38:25.003 --> 38:26.104
It's better than
The Exorcist, I promise.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.739
It's a classic.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.375
That's what you said
about The Exorcist.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.876
True, but...
Ray.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.078
I know, you're tired.
Ray...

38:33.078 --> 38:36.548
Okay, look, I know
you don't like devil movies.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.616
It's the last one, I promise.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.551
I think...

38:39.551 --> 38:40.986
I should move out.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.455
Why?

38:43.455 --> 38:45.857
I think we both know why.

38:52.531 --> 38:56.435
( speaking softly )

38:56.435 --> 38:57.769
Where's Mahir?

38:57.769 --> 39:01.440
I don't now.
I'm afraid for him.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.675
He just needs some time.

39:05.977 --> 39:08.947
I'm... I'm sorry
to bother you with this,

39:08.947 --> 39:12.484
but, uh, you need to sign
for her things.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.669
This is the hardest thing

39:30.669 --> 39:33.472
for any parent
to experience.

39:33.472 --> 39:38.610
How do you protect them
from all the evil in the world?

39:41.647 --> 39:43.949
You can't.
( sobbing )

39:43.949 --> 39:46.552
No matter what
you do, you can't.

39:46.552 --> 39:51.923
Mahir was beaten up at school
after 9/11 for being Muslim.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.160
They called him a terrorist.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.797
Ever since then he became
very strict about his prayers.

39:58.797 --> 40:01.066
He cut himself off
from everything

40:01.066 --> 40:03.869
except his fundamentalist
friends.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.404
He wanted the same thing
for his sister.

40:09.708 --> 40:14.513
There's a park down the street
where we live.

40:14.513 --> 40:20.486
I close my eyes and they're just
little children on the swings.

40:20.486 --> 40:23.689
( sobbing )
Oh, God.

40:23.689 --> 40:25.023
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

40:25.023 --> 40:28.560
It's all right.
It's all right.

40:32.063 --> 40:36.134
I brought them to this country
to find justice and freedom.

40:36.134 --> 40:39.237
But I lose two children today.

40:39.237 --> 40:40.606
Two children.

40:40.606 --> 40:41.807
( sobbing ):
Oh, God.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.975
Mahir... Mahir
will be all right.

40:43.975 --> 40:48.947
I can't pretend that I don't
know what I know in my heart.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.916
He loved his sister,

40:50.916 --> 40:53.752
but he thought
she was disgracing the family,

40:53.752 --> 40:55.587
disgracing herself.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.155
Oh, God.

40:57.155 --> 41:00.091
( sobbing ):
Doctor,

41:00.091 --> 41:02.694
Doctor, Doctor.

41:02.694 --> 41:05.597
Doctor, tell the police
to search my house first.

41:05.597 --> 41:09.134
They should look in Mahir's room
for the knife.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.603
Oh, God.

41:11.603 --> 41:15.807
( speaking Turkish )

41:15.807 --> 41:18.910
( sobbing )

41:21.980 --> 41:24.249
This was an honor killing?

41:27.052 --> 41:29.988
Yes. Yes.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.157
That's what they call it.

41:32.157 --> 41:36.562
But there is no honor here.

41:36.562 --> 41:39.097
( speaks softly )

41:39.097 --> 41:42.801
( sobbing )

41:51.309 --> 41:53.645
Hey, Morris, what the hell
you still doing here, man?

41:53.645 --> 41:56.582
Downloading a picture of my kids
from the ER camera.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.850
Really photogenic,
aren't they, huh?

42:00.619 --> 42:02.821
I'm going to use this one
for my Christmas card.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.123
I hate Christmas
cards, man.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.259
Hey, you want to go grab
some dinner together?

42:08.259 --> 42:11.797
Uh, no, my oldest boy, Michael,
DJs an on-line radio show.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.031
I want to check it out
tonight.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.733
Hey, why don't we listen
to it right here?

42:14.733 --> 42:16.935
No, I can't 'cause after that,
I gotta brush up on my trig

42:16.935 --> 42:18.704
so I can help Melia
with her homework.

42:18.704 --> 42:21.072
She's ten years old, she's
smarter at math than I am, huh?

42:21.072 --> 42:23.174
Family really keeps
you busy, huh?

42:23.174 --> 42:26.778
Yeah, but it's worth it,
though, right?

42:26.778 --> 42:28.213
So, you, uh, heading home?

42:28.213 --> 42:29.915
I heard your apartment
got pretty messed up.

42:29.915 --> 42:31.883
No, it's fixed.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.852
I mean, that's finally what it
took the landlord to paint it.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.325
Okay then. Cool.

42:40.325 --> 42:41.793
Welcome back, Vic.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.194
You have a good night.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.663
You, too, man.
