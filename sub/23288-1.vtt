00:37.521 --> 00:41.651
I want to go home!

Inari!

00:54.538 --> 00:58.376
<i>Two weeks earlier</i>

00:58.459 --> 01:03.172
<i>Even though Kapu was
one of my closest friends</i>

01:03.255 --> 01:06.759
I didn't meet him very often
over the last few years.

01:06.842 --> 01:09.387
He was traveling.

01:09.470 --> 01:13.891
But what I heard of him
made me jealous.

01:15.059 --> 01:18.354
Kapu had finally found
the joy of life

01:18.437 --> 01:22.817
unlike me or probably
everyone else in this room.

01:22.900 --> 01:28.114
Kapu had the courage to do everything
he'd only dreamed about before.

01:30.491 --> 01:34.704
If our thread of life
should suddenly snap

01:34.787 --> 01:38.290
how many of us
would be relieved to know

01:38.374 --> 01:42.712
that we lived life to the fullest,
if only for a moment?

01:42.795 --> 01:48.175
We, who repeat our
meaningless rituals day after day.

01:49.093 --> 01:55.766
We, who can't see further
than the Muoniontie petrol station.

01:55.850 --> 02:00.187
We, who do the same old shit
from morning till night...

03:20.810 --> 03:24.772
<i>"The seed no longer wants to be..."

03:24.855 --> 03:28.776
No, I'm... constipated.

03:30.903 --> 03:34.365
You just plug the electrodes
into the headphone port

03:34.448 --> 03:38.661
and the app will turn all music
into electrical impulses.

03:38.744 --> 03:41.956
You're actually able
to feel the music.

03:42.039 --> 03:45.126
Where do you attach the electrodes?

03:46.627 --> 03:51.507
You can stick them wherever you like.
Beatron is the new Spotify.

03:52.758 --> 03:58.848
Um... Maarit, didn't you say you were
on antidepressants for a while

03:58.931 --> 04:02.226
and they helped you
through the worst?

04:02.309 --> 04:06.772
Yeah. They worked for me.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.486
What's up, Janne?

04:13.612 --> 04:16.240
Operating ski lifts
in the winter again?

04:16.322 --> 04:19.952
<i>"The seed no longer wants
to be a seed; it wants to grow."</i>

04:20.035 --> 04:23.038
I thought I'd go to Spain. Huh?

04:24.415 --> 04:27.459
I'll walk to Santiago de Compostela.
What?

04:27.543 --> 04:31.463
You mean the pilgrimage route?
Have you gone bonkers?

04:31.547 --> 04:33.924
No. Doesn't that take months?

04:34.008 --> 04:39.013
Two. Well, you're not
walking anywhere.

04:39.096 --> 04:41.765
My parents can
help out with the kids.

04:41.849 --> 04:45.728
What is this? You even take out
the rubbish by car. Exactly.

04:45.811 --> 04:49.982
Can't you go somewhere closer?
There are attractions here.

04:50.065 --> 04:54.278
Like the HettaPallas trail.
It's not the same.

04:54.945 --> 04:59.283
Well, you're not going to Spain
for two months. That's for sure.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.258
PALLASTUNTURI FELLS

06:00.261 --> 06:05.432
Wake up. You won't believe
what just happened. What?

06:05.516 --> 06:08.185
This fell off the garage shelf.

06:09.436 --> 06:13.482
Look at the badge. Look! Pallas.
What?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.610
Pallas!

06:17.403 --> 06:19.947
Have you been drinking? No...

06:20.030 --> 06:24.368
I was on that school trip,
or we were. Who?

06:24.451 --> 06:29.456
Kapu and I. Kapu's ashes
haven't been scattered yet

06:29.540 --> 06:34.003
and when I'm old,
and Kapu is not...

06:34.086 --> 06:37.589
I mean, he'll never be old.

06:40.134 --> 06:44.555
I'm going to walk from Hetta to
Pallas and scatter his ashes there.

06:48.183 --> 06:50.644
Okay.

07:00.154 --> 07:03.574
<i>July 12th, 2017. Day zero.</i>

07:03.657 --> 07:09.079
<i>The preparations have electrified me.
The flame is tiny but burning.</i>

07:55.834 --> 08:00.214
We're going now.
Your mum's here. Okay.

08:00.297 --> 08:03.217
Fix the converter box!

08:03.884 --> 08:07.638
Dad... I'm sorry
about this overlap, but...

08:07.721 --> 08:10.432
I owe Saana a hundred favours

08:10.516 --> 08:14.228
and the team needs a carer.

08:14.311 --> 08:18.857
Well, don't exhaust yourself
unnecessarily.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.529
This is purely a sports trip.

08:32.871 --> 08:37.042
Hello. You don't mind
if we take a leak?

08:42.464 --> 08:44.508
Hi.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.471
Bye bye!

08:52.141 --> 08:56.103
Thanks for letting me come.
I would've gone crazy at home.

08:56.186 --> 09:00.065
I just spent a week and a half
alone with the kids.

09:00.149 --> 09:03.861
My turn to enjoy the perks
of shared parenting.

09:03.944 --> 09:08.157
It went for my tits!
What a rude creature.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.468
Just go ahead.

09:27.801 --> 09:32.514
The wilderness has been
my church, too.

09:32.598 --> 09:36.560
I've always found peace
in the forest.

09:48.947 --> 09:51.074
PENIS

09:53.494 --> 09:57.122
What's up, prick... ly beards?

09:57.623 --> 10:01.793
My gig at the fair was canceled.
I thought I'd join you for the hike.

10:01.877 --> 10:05.964
You? Hiking? Yeah.

10:08.258 --> 10:13.680
Where's Räihänen?
I haven't talked to him about this.

10:13.764 --> 10:16.767
I figured this would be a retreat.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.895
What? A retreat.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.315
Fuck off.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.196
Bye then. Bye.

10:30.113 --> 10:33.200
Are you coming?

10:36.286 --> 10:40.874
<i>Would you come to the lake with me?</i>

10:40.958 --> 10:44.336
<i>I would dive for a white pearl
just for you...</i>

10:49.758 --> 10:54.304
<i>Day 1. July 13th, 2017.</i>

10:55.222 --> 10:57.891
<i>The path is open.</i>

11:07.734 --> 11:09.695
<i>This is the beginning.</i>

11:12.030 --> 11:15.742
<i>I think of the words of
the musical genius Gösta Sundqvist:</i>

11:15.826 --> 11:22.583
<i>"He leaves, though leaving,
he feels a pang."</i>

11:23.125 --> 11:28.046
<i>"Leaving is the main thing,
he remembers someone saying."</i>

11:28.130 --> 11:31.466
Let's try to reach
the Pyhäkero ravine today.

11:31.550 --> 11:34.136
Isn't there a good hut on the shore?

11:34.219 --> 11:39.433
We should walk at least ten
kilometres. For the feet to adjust.

11:39.516 --> 11:44.980
You're not seriously going to walk
to Pallas? What do you mean?

11:45.063 --> 11:50.027
I thought hiking was just a ruse
to fool the wives. Huh?

11:50.110 --> 11:54.906
You said it sort of like... "Hiking".

11:56.241 --> 11:58.035
No, I didn't.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.413
I don't have any gear
except my frisbees and this.

12:01.496 --> 12:04.541
You're not blasting music out here.

12:04.625 --> 12:08.462
This is a Bluetooth speaker.
The response is up to 76 hertz.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.552
I hear that in 1980s houses,
the bases damage easily.

12:15.677 --> 12:19.931
Humidity will go through
into the bottom exterior wall.

12:20.015 --> 12:23.393
Seriously. There's a weird smell.

12:24.686 --> 12:29.566
How many sound engineers
does it take to change a light bulb?

12:30.150 --> 12:33.779
One, two, one, two.

12:36.281 --> 12:40.577
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and playboys

12:40.702 --> 12:47.209
welcome to the recreation weekend
for Kolari Property Services.

12:47.292 --> 12:54.007
Our destination is Vuokatti, and
the travel time is about six hours.

12:54.091 --> 12:58.303
Merja will hand out the team shirts.
Do they come in slim fit?

12:58.387 --> 13:03.850
I also have a little announcement.
Last week, it was confirmed

13:03.934 --> 13:07.938
that Uolevi won't come back to work
from his sick leave.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.023
Oh. Uolevi is nice.

13:10.107 --> 13:17.030
So, we'll be accepting applications
for the managerial top position.

13:17.114 --> 13:19.241
If there's no opposition.

13:25.997 --> 13:29.835
Why don't you apply? You've worked
in personnel management.

13:29.918 --> 13:34.214
Your turn, Inari. I don't know
anything about property services.

13:34.297 --> 13:39.302
Are we playing?
And I can't put Ilja in daycare yet.

13:39.386 --> 13:43.807
Janne will be operating
ski lifts again. Inari!

13:43.890 --> 13:49.646
Hey, are you playing or not? Okay.

13:55.068 --> 14:00.198
Alright! Who's that click calling?
Business, business!

14:00.282 --> 14:06.037
I didn't promise four percent.
Two is the max. Fuck you, too.

14:07.080 --> 14:13.003
Interface, my ass.
How about some peer support?

14:13.086 --> 14:15.964
If you must follow,
could you at least shut up?

14:16.047 --> 14:18.425
I'm trying to get in rhythm.

14:19.134 --> 14:22.721
Okay, I'll get back to you.
And leave the beers here.

14:22.846 --> 14:26.266
I won't carry you.
These are expensive beers!

14:26.349 --> 14:31.563
I ordered these from Holland.
15.6 percent ABV, freeze distilled.

14:32.481 --> 14:36.026
Right. Goddammit!

14:36.610 --> 14:39.613
The 3G network doesn't work anymore.

14:40.614 --> 14:44.201
I haven't jacked off
without porn for three years.

14:45.368 --> 14:48.622
I'll have to settle for Beatron.

14:56.171 --> 15:00.634
Have a crisp.
I'm on a gluten free diet.

15:00.717 --> 15:05.889
Why? Gluten causes
chronic intestinal inflammation.

15:05.972 --> 15:09.184
And that may cause depression.

15:09.267 --> 15:14.147
The intestines are our second brain.
In fact, our original brain.

15:24.241 --> 15:28.036
So, this is Finland's
most beautiful hiking trail?

15:28.119 --> 15:31.706
The same backwoods
as everywhere else.

15:41.049 --> 15:43.969
Listen to this.

15:46.054 --> 15:49.474
Doesn't this ease the soul already?

15:50.392 --> 15:54.062
Girls, let's sprint across the bog!

16:26.845 --> 16:29.556
Hi. Hi.

16:50.035 --> 16:52.829
Bloody hell!

16:55.248 --> 17:00.670
Good thing they came away.
Maybe there's no one at Pyhäkero.

17:09.637 --> 17:14.267
What's this, Summer Services?
No, a confirmation class hike.

17:14.351 --> 17:17.686
And these guys are training
for a gospel festival.

17:18.355 --> 17:20.982
Fucking fuck.

17:25.779 --> 17:31.701
Goddammit! Räihä!
Räihänen is over there!

17:32.994 --> 17:37.082
What's up, prick?
What are you doing here?

17:37.165 --> 17:42.253
He's walking to Pallas,
and I'm stupid enough to follow. Hi.

17:42.337 --> 17:44.422
Didn't you know? No.

17:44.506 --> 17:49.511
I came to do some fishing. They've
planted whitefish in Ullatieva.

17:49.594 --> 17:51.721
I caught some.

17:54.891 --> 18:00.313
What an unbelievable coincidence.
Fucking great!

18:00.397 --> 18:06.820
All the gaylords in the same canoe.
Are you going to stay long?

18:08.238 --> 18:11.449
I'll kill myself if I stay here.

18:12.909 --> 18:18.248
Motherfucker. There's an outhouse,
a well, and everything!

18:19.332 --> 18:22.043
<i>This path leads me towards myself.</i>

18:22.127 --> 18:26.798
<i>It seems a twist of fate that
I'm accompanied by these very people.</i>

18:26.881 --> 18:29.342
<i>Maybe it was meant to be.</i>

18:34.597 --> 18:39.602
Are those Meindl boots brand new?
Yeah.

18:40.812 --> 18:44.858
Have they worked well? Yeah.

18:44.941 --> 18:51.197
Should I invest in a pair?
Rubber boots don't give much support.

18:52.115 --> 18:57.412
<i>Maybe they're on a journey
towards their inner selves, too.</i>

18:57.871 --> 19:00.540
I'm going to throw up!

19:10.592 --> 19:15.722
Right. Wait till we reach
the top of Pallas.

20:29.921 --> 20:32.340
Beatron, Beatron...

20:47.689 --> 20:52.861
Want something to drink? Cut brandy,
and you don't even drink!

20:52.944 --> 20:55.655
Have a look at this.

21:05.415 --> 21:07.709
What are these?

21:09.043 --> 21:12.088
They look like wood anemones.

21:15.008 --> 21:18.511
No, they're not wood anemones.

21:24.017 --> 21:28.021
Boys, what do you think is
the meaning of life?

21:30.815 --> 21:35.278
Well... For me,
it's our firm breaking through

21:35.361 --> 21:38.114
and me making a lucrative exit.

21:38.239 --> 21:44.537
Then I'll have a party on a yacht
in Monaco with a hundred hookers.

21:44.621 --> 21:49.792
Plus Maarit. You're invited, too.
Thanks.

21:49.876 --> 21:53.671
What's the meaning of life for you,
Räihänen?

21:54.631 --> 22:00.511
I don't know.
Maybe bench pressing 150 kilos.

22:01.346 --> 22:04.807
Inari thinks I'm useless.

22:04.891 --> 22:08.436
Nonsense. You're a good guy.

22:09.479 --> 22:12.607
Isn't he, Räihä? Yeah.

22:12.690 --> 22:17.070
But still a bit useless.
No, you're not.

22:17.153 --> 22:21.366
A bit useless, I'm sure!
You're not at all useless.

22:24.953 --> 22:30.792
Why did I eat so damn much?
I was supposed to lose weight here.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.886
He's totally useless.

22:41.970 --> 22:44.389
Hey, take a look!

22:46.266 --> 22:48.643
Unbelievable!

22:52.063 --> 22:55.441
Timo! Unbelievable!

23:06.828 --> 23:10.206
Kolari Property Services
SWAMP SOCCER 2017

23:10.290 --> 23:12.917
Alright.

23:16.170 --> 23:22.385
We're leaving for the bog at 8 a.m.
Keep that in mind.

23:22.468 --> 23:25.346
I'm calling the bottom bunk.

23:25.430 --> 23:28.099
Take your shoes off!

23:30.018 --> 23:34.022
Is there a fridge?
We need to get the beers cold.

23:35.398 --> 23:38.067
We need to get to the shore.

23:39.152 --> 23:43.990
I'll tell the driver.
You're the hippies from Kolari.

23:44.782 --> 23:49.037
You didn't come to play, did you?
I didn't.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.750
Good. It would've been a shame
to slaughter such a princess.

23:58.629 --> 24:03.968
By the way, this is our driveway.
We were told that we could park here.

24:04.385 --> 24:09.140
Really? Who told you that?
The rental agency.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.935
I'm sure there's another road.

24:13.019 --> 24:17.106
Is Timo inside? Go get him.
He's busy.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.528
We've won the firm tournament
twice in a row.

24:22.612 --> 24:28.117
We rented the most expensive cottage.
And we have platinum VIP passes.

24:29.952 --> 24:33.998
But we can always
call the organizers

24:34.082 --> 24:36.209
and ask them.

24:36.292 --> 24:40.797
That's right.
Fuck off, or I'll kick your ass.

24:45.760 --> 24:50.264
What's taking so long?
They won't move their bus.

24:50.348 --> 24:54.435
They're from Kolari Property
Services. This is our driveway.

24:54.519 --> 24:57.438
Take another road to the shore.

24:59.732 --> 25:02.819
We'll back off.

25:08.282 --> 25:13.204
Who left his bag
in the middle of the floor? Honestly!

25:14.163 --> 25:18.000
Are the beers in the fridge? Hi.

25:28.344 --> 25:32.807
Hey, who decides on
Uolevi's successor? Timo.

25:44.068 --> 25:48.114
"It's time to break away."

25:48.739 --> 25:54.203
"Repeat this exercise for seven clays,
always at the same time."

26:22.482 --> 26:25.693
Would you turn that down, please?

26:25.776 --> 26:28.529
Go, Janne!

26:47.381 --> 26:49.467
Go for it!

26:52.929 --> 26:56.307
I'm serious, turn that down!

27:01.270 --> 27:03.689
Fucking hot in here.

27:31.509 --> 27:34.428
Fucking pricks, turn that thing off!

28:50.254 --> 28:54.050
Excuse me.
I don't know if I can play.

28:54.717 --> 28:58.888
My gout is acting up in my knee.

28:58.971 --> 29:02.683
Is there any chance I could play?

29:02.767 --> 29:05.978
I used to play football,
and I still play floor ball.

29:06.062 --> 29:10.775
I guess it's okay.
If the captain doesn't mind.

29:10.858 --> 29:16.489
Haven't I told you I can't talk
on the bus? I get sick!

29:17.156 --> 29:21.786
I'm sure it's fine.
Here we go... Too late.

29:34.090 --> 29:38.719
There's a lot of people.
Let's go with the flow.

30:07.164 --> 30:12.628
<i>Welcome to the Swamp Soccer
Firm Tournament 2017!</i>

30:12.753 --> 30:15.965
<i>Let's roll up some peat!</i>

30:16.048 --> 30:19.510
<i>The crowd starts
pouring into the field.</i>

30:19.593 --> 30:23.264
<i>We have a world class atmosphere
out here.</i>

30:23.347 --> 30:28.519
<i>We have teams from Turva, Varma,
and Vuokatin Aateli.</i>

30:28.602 --> 30:32.189
<i>Kolari Property Services
is pursuing success.</i>

30:32.273 --> 30:37.069
<i>Not to mention a double winner,
Kittilä Property Boys.</i>

30:37.153 --> 30:42.783
<i>Let's get the wave rolling
and make some noise!</i>

30:45.369 --> 30:47.246
<i>Great!</i>

30:48.998 --> 30:53.210
<i>In field 4, Siilinjärvi Angels...</i>

30:58.924 --> 31:03.637
This game goes to you, since
your opponents didn't arrive on time.

31:04.346 --> 31:06.432
Congratulations.

31:09.810 --> 31:12.271
Did we win?

31:12.354 --> 31:14.815
Can we go to the sauna now?

31:15.983 --> 31:19.653
Well... No.

31:37.379 --> 31:41.967
You're closer to the meaning of life.
A hundred females sucked your dick.

31:43.093 --> 31:48.057
Give me some of that repellent,
so I won't catch gonorrhoea.

31:49.099 --> 31:54.438
<i>In the restaurant tent,
reindeer sausage and chips...</i>

31:54.522 --> 31:58.442
My knee is acting up. Oh dear.

32:02.363 --> 32:06.492
Give your all right till the end.
Go, guys.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.632
Oh my.

32:23.676 --> 32:29.598
<i>In field 7, FC Big Mikko
against Kolari Property Services.</i>

32:29.682 --> 32:32.309
<i>It'll be a tough game.</i>

32:37.064 --> 32:39.066
Hi. Hi.

32:40.776 --> 32:43.612
Have you gone back to work? No.

32:44.989 --> 32:47.449
Saana asked me to help out. Right.

32:47.533 --> 32:52.204
I'm sorry about that night
when I was in my underwear...

32:52.288 --> 32:55.708
I misinterpreted the situation.

32:55.791 --> 33:00.045
Normally I never
really take Viagra...

33:00.129 --> 33:04.717
And I didn't mean the porn... It was
a short circuit. No need to explain.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.760
Especially not here.

33:08.345 --> 33:13.726
You don't need to worry
about me chasing you.

33:13.809 --> 33:16.937
I'm dating someone.

33:17.021 --> 33:22.026
Here. Penelope is from Greece.
We met in Corfu a year ago.

33:23.152 --> 33:27.448
I had her hair dyed,
so she'd feel more at home.

33:32.536 --> 33:35.122
Substitution!

33:36.999 --> 33:39.251
Substitution!

33:44.173 --> 33:48.510
<i>And it's a goal against
Kolari Property Services.</i>

33:48.594 --> 33:51.096
I'll do my jab!

33:53.974 --> 33:56.310
Going up field!

33:59.521 --> 34:02.024
Good! Are you stuck?

34:13.494 --> 34:17.081
<i>July 14th, 2017. Day 2.</i>

34:18.748 --> 34:21.793
<i>My feet are sore
from yesterday's hike</i>

34:21.877 --> 34:25.880
<i>and my back is tense
after a night on the camping mat.</i>

34:26.005 --> 34:31.094
<i>But in some way, all this pain
and strain feels good.</i>

34:31.178 --> 34:34.223
<i>I'm finding the ability
to strive again.</i>

34:34.974 --> 34:39.770
<i>I still don't know who I am,
but at least I know where I'm going.</i>

34:40.980 --> 34:46.443
"I still don't know who I am,
but at least I know where I'm going."

34:46.527 --> 34:48.654
Alright, give it to me.

34:48.737 --> 34:54.827
"Maybe the key to happiness is
learning to set goals for oneself."

34:54.909 --> 34:57.246
Don't you know who you are?

35:00.541 --> 35:04.211
You're not a new
bestselling author, that's for sure.

35:04.294 --> 35:06.880
Guys...

35:26.775 --> 35:32.448
Oh my... Naturists.

35:43.834 --> 35:48.047
What nice weather.
Where do you come from?

35:49.757 --> 35:54.094
Kolari... Or he's originally
from Pelkosenniemi.

35:54.178 --> 35:59.016
I meant your direction.
Is Hannukuru far away? Oh.

35:59.099 --> 36:04.146
We left from Hetta.
Maybe 12 kilometres.

36:04.229 --> 36:08.609
I see, you're like locals.
From these parts.

36:08.692 --> 36:11.028
Right.

36:11.153 --> 36:15.157
Where are you... What?

36:15.240 --> 36:19.703
Uh... Where are you from?
We live in Helsinki.

36:19.787 --> 36:23.540
For the time being. I hope
you don't mind us being naked.

36:23.624 --> 36:28.670
No... we're not particular.
What did I tell you? No one cares.

36:28.754 --> 36:33.008
These boys are from the North;
they're children of nature.

36:33.133 --> 36:37.513
Ilkka was whining:
"Dare we really hike in the nude?"

36:37.596 --> 36:41.892
Absolutely! Hello! Nudity is
the most natural thing in the world.

36:41.975 --> 36:45.229
Right? Yeah, it's quite natural...

36:45.312 --> 36:47.815
Should we be going?
I'm getting hungry.

36:47.898 --> 36:53.654
This is so liberating!
I warmly recommend it. Amazing!

36:55.239 --> 36:57.616
Have a great hike. You too.

36:57.699 --> 37:01.286
See you. And welcome.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.626
"Welcome"?

37:07.709 --> 37:12.047
They're going to Hannukuru, too.
Let's follow them!

37:12.172 --> 37:16.343
No. There's nothing more pathetic

37:16.426 --> 37:21.306
than middle aged men
drooling over random asses.

37:27.062 --> 37:30.899
Fantastic playing!
Substitution.

37:32.109 --> 37:36.530
Go, go!
About the Personnel Manager job...

37:36.613 --> 37:39.241
Yeah? Fucking faggots.

37:39.324 --> 37:43.662
I was just thinking...
My parental leave is ending soon.

37:43.745 --> 37:47.666
And your group seems nice.

37:47.749 --> 37:50.711
I kind of promised the job to Kai.

37:51.378 --> 37:56.925
Rub my back!
Lower, goddammit!

38:00.929 --> 38:04.308
No... Say it. This is a good one.

38:06.143 --> 38:09.354
Fucking knock knock.
Who's there?

38:10.355 --> 38:16.695
Don't you know?
Did you get it? He doesn't know!

38:18.363 --> 38:22.701
I ate too much again. Maybe
you're filling your inner void.

38:29.124 --> 38:32.753
You feel small
in a landscape like this.

38:32.836 --> 38:35.631
You almost forget who you are.

38:38.508 --> 38:42.387
Julius... Does your click still hurt?

38:43.639 --> 38:46.391
Yeah.

38:46.475 --> 38:50.312
But in some way,
the pain feels good!

39:01.281 --> 39:04.868
Well, well... Yeah.

39:08.413 --> 39:13.168
Well, hello. Hello.

39:13.752 --> 39:17.589
I see you're hiking, too.

39:18.423 --> 39:21.009
Yeah. Right.

39:22.386 --> 39:26.640
Not bad weather. No.

39:27.099 --> 39:32.854
Yeah. But there might be
a storm tomorrow.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.773
Yeah.

39:35.691 --> 39:38.944
You're going to Ylläs? Pallas.

39:42.114 --> 39:45.492
Right. Well...

39:47.411 --> 39:51.873
I think we're... Yeah.

39:52.749 --> 39:55.544
You look fit.

39:59.756 --> 40:04.720
Hi. It's like the sliding doors
of a department store.

40:10.767 --> 40:12.477
Um... Yeah?

40:12.561 --> 40:18.400
Maybe you can... take this.

40:18.483 --> 40:24.489
Since I haven't got round to it
at Christmas. I've been busy.

40:24.573 --> 40:28.368
Your grandfather carved this
during the Continuation War.

40:28.452 --> 40:32.956
With a bayonet. Thanks.

40:35.751 --> 40:38.795
Yeah. Right.

40:47.971 --> 40:51.224
Was that your clad with his sons?

40:52.100 --> 40:57.606
Quite jovial people, you Räihänens.
Couldn't get a word in edgeways.

40:57.689 --> 41:02.527
Kämä... There are some things
you shouldn't joke about.

41:05.655 --> 41:12.037
It must've been serious business
when he made you with your mum.

41:18.710 --> 41:21.630
Wait. Wait!

41:25.258 --> 41:28.428
We're halfway on the hike.

41:28.512 --> 41:33.809
From now on, each step will take us
closer to the end than the beginning.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.561
Thank God!

41:41.733 --> 41:46.154
<i>On the journey, you realise
that it will end at some point.</i>

41:46.238 --> 41:51.159
<i>What's been left behind,
where 's the destination... Come on!</i>

41:52.911 --> 41:57.290
<i>I'm starving.
I wish I could eat a sausage.</i>

42:29.823 --> 42:32.159
The naturists.

42:38.790 --> 42:41.042
Oh, hi.

42:43.753 --> 42:50.051
I think the ground is
more even over there. Yeah.

42:54.097 --> 42:58.810
Can I boil water with your cooker?
He's struggling to assemble ours.

42:58.894 --> 43:01.646
I'll use this.

43:01.730 --> 43:05.025
If you want to do it fast, use this.

43:06.985 --> 43:10.489
I have a gas burner, too. Brand new.

43:11.364 --> 43:14.910
But the air intake in this
creates a cyclic flow.

43:17.621 --> 43:20.332
This has the best thermal efficiency.

43:21.666 --> 43:25.587
A neoprene cover retains heat.

43:29.925 --> 43:34.262
Never mind! They had extra water.

43:36.139 --> 43:38.099
70.

43:38.183 --> 43:41.686
<i>And it's 80!</i>

43:41.770 --> 43:45.607
<i>20,30,40!</i>

43:45.690 --> 43:52.197
Alright! What a fantastic clay!
Everyone excelled themselves.

43:52.280 --> 43:55.158
Sometimes the opponent
is just better.

43:55.742 --> 44:00.288
Tomorrow morning, we're facing
our toughest competitor

44:00.372 --> 44:05.252
Kittilä Wank...
Sorry, Property Boys.

44:06.044 --> 44:12.008
Now, Kai will present us
with a game plan for winning.

44:12.092 --> 44:14.344
Who's that Kai?
Timo's nephew.

44:14.427 --> 44:18.306
We're going to score at least once
at this tournament.

44:19.558 --> 44:21.768
Go ahead, Kai.

44:21.851 --> 44:26.147
Let's take a look at
yesterday's game plan.

44:27.482 --> 44:31.361
We didn't score one single goal...

44:33.947 --> 44:37.409
You did this to it.

44:40.161 --> 44:44.416
Then...

44:46.376 --> 44:48.920
And finally...

44:50.964 --> 44:54.092
You did this.
Thank you, Kai.

44:54.175 --> 44:57.262
I think we got the message.

45:03.685 --> 45:06.730
Excuse me.

45:06.813 --> 45:11.484
This is none of my business,
but why not make Juuso the forward?

45:12.027 --> 45:15.447
After all, he plays football
in the Second Division.

45:15.530 --> 45:20.702
The goalie should be someone big
who isn't afraid of the ball. Pekka.

45:24.998 --> 45:28.960
I mean... That was just a suggestion.

45:30.712 --> 45:36.259
Sounds smart. We could try to help
Juuso score headers.

45:36.343 --> 45:39.638
There's no use trying to kick it in.
I'll second that.

45:39.721 --> 45:41.931
Me too.

45:42.015 --> 45:45.018
That's exactly what
I was going to suggest!

45:45.101 --> 45:48.563
But will you stick to the plan?

46:00.659 --> 46:04.079
If you have a CV, send it to me.

46:14.547 --> 46:17.550
Hey dude, come out already!

46:32.982 --> 46:36.528
I mean it! This is the only toilet!

46:43.785 --> 46:47.497
Glutenfree, my ass.

46:47.831 --> 46:50.834
How about you?
No, thanks. We're vegetarians.

46:50.917 --> 46:54.379
Yeah, thanks. When in Rome.

46:54.462 --> 46:58.675
Gluten damages my intestinal lining.
Oh no.

47:04.055 --> 47:07.517
This may sound strange

47:07.600 --> 47:12.063
but would you mind if we had some...
magic mushrooms?

47:12.147 --> 47:18.570
I've been doing some soul searching
lately with their help.

47:19.070 --> 47:22.657
I think they would work best
in the wilderness.

47:22.741 --> 47:25.910
Why did you bring them?
Shouldn't I have?

47:25.994 --> 47:28.580
It doesn't go with
what we talked about.

47:28.663 --> 47:32.125
You're ruining the atmosphere!

47:32.208 --> 47:36.254
Okay. Well, I'm not taking drugs
and tripping out here.

47:36.337 --> 47:39.841
Drugs? They're Finnish liberty caps!

47:41.509 --> 47:45.096
What do you mean by soul searching?

47:48.600 --> 47:51.811
19... and 20.

47:54.397 --> 47:57.025
I wonder if this is wise.

47:57.108 --> 48:01.905
Shouldn't you try everything once,
except Zumba?

48:03.072 --> 48:05.366
That's right.

48:06.367 --> 48:08.912
It may take an hour
for them to kick in.

48:08.995 --> 48:13.750
Just give us space and don't ask us
to report how we feel.

48:15.627 --> 48:19.714
Do you feel anything?
Are they kicking in?

48:19.839 --> 48:24.093
How about we take turns in telling
why we came here?

48:25.053 --> 48:26.971
Yeah, I'll start.

48:27.055 --> 48:31.017
Hanna and I decided to turn over
a new leaf in our relationship.

48:31.100 --> 48:36.397
We gave up contraception
and came here to make a baby.

48:36.481 --> 48:40.235
Ilkka, it sounds terrible
when you put it like that.

48:40.318 --> 48:44.239
There are other reasons
besides a baby.

48:48.618 --> 48:50.286
I can see that.

48:51.579 --> 48:54.999
It was a total surprise
bumping into these guys.

48:55.083 --> 48:59.921
I was going fishing and figured
I'd practice joking while at it.

49:00.004 --> 49:05.552
You? joking? I've written a joik
about the debt crisis in Europe.

49:05.635 --> 49:09.389
And about Jouni's Supermarket.
I'm a musician myself.

49:09.472 --> 49:13.017
I've made a sound sculpture...

49:16.646 --> 49:20.233
What the fuck?
How long do the effects last?

49:20.316 --> 49:22.694
About six hours.

49:34.581 --> 49:39.252
Tapio. That idiot is the only one
who believes we met by accident.

49:39.335 --> 49:43.715
Your clad won't start loving you
even if you bench press 2,000 kilos.

49:43.798 --> 49:47.677
He's a prick.
Have you noticed? Okay!

49:48.845 --> 49:52.974
Hey! I've been listening to
that bullshit for three hours!

49:53.391 --> 49:56.936
Tapio, everything will be alright.

50:11.701 --> 50:13.369
<i>Yeah?</i>

50:13.453 --> 50:17.040
<i>It's me, hi. What did you mean
when you said</i>

50:17.123 --> 50:20.084
that I should get on my feet
mentally, for us?

50:20.168 --> 50:22.545
<i>What's the time?
Don 't you remember?</i>

50:22.629 --> 50:24.380
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

50:24.464 --> 50:27.175
This is just speculation

50:27.258 --> 50:31.971
<i>but would it be impossible
to put Ilja in daycare in the autumn?</i>

50:32.055 --> 50:34.474
Oh, wow. Is that a no?

50:34.557 --> 50:36.476
<i>Don't mess with me!</i>

50:39.771 --> 50:43.274
<i>If! don 't cheer up, you'll leave me?
Are you drinking?</i>

50:43.358 --> 50:48.071
What if I am? Don't mess with me,
Zumba woman.

51:22.522 --> 51:25.483
Here are Hanna's
morning temperatures...

51:39.914 --> 51:45.336
<i>Mashed potatoes not available
in ready meals...</i>

51:49.298 --> 51:52.677
Janne, what are you doing?
Wartime instruments.

51:52.760 --> 51:57.265
They're old grenades!
Oh. Let's get the fire going then.

51:58.433 --> 52:01.185
Don't they... Goddammit!

52:47.857 --> 52:51.861
Unbelievable! It was raining rocks
over my tent!

52:53.446 --> 52:57.909
No worry. Gas bottle explosion.

52:57.992 --> 53:02.121
We're calling <i>poliisi</i>, not you.

53:02.663 --> 53:07.752
I'm a useless man.
Stop that wallowing.

53:07.835 --> 53:12.131
No, it wasn't a coincidence
I was at Pyhäkero.

53:12.965 --> 53:18.763
I thought it would be nice
to scatter Kapu's ashes together.

53:19.639 --> 53:24.811
He was my friend, too.
But no. Go alone then!

53:26.437 --> 53:31.776
Goddammit! My supplements are gone.
And my phone is broken!

53:31.859 --> 53:36.155
What's got into him?
Kapu's ashes?

53:36.239 --> 53:39.659
I thought I'd take them to Pallas.

53:41.661 --> 53:47.166
Räihä was right. You're not
the only one with problems.

53:48.626 --> 53:52.338
Maarit has endometriosis,
and Dad is drinking again

53:52.421 --> 53:56.634
but I don't go around reciting
some fucking self help books!

53:56.717 --> 53:59.303
Go to bed!

54:14.777 --> 54:21.159
Look what they did! Can't one have
any peace and quiet anywhere?

54:21.242 --> 54:24.412
Rocks raining over me!

54:31.752 --> 54:37.592
<i>What am I doing here? I know less
about life than I did when I left.</i>

54:37.675 --> 54:40.219
<i>Fuck, I 'm a terrible person.</i>

54:42.305 --> 54:45.016
<i>Where 's the next maintenance road?</i>

54:45.099 --> 54:50.271
<i>I'll hitch a ride on an A TV,
pick up the kids... Wait!</i>

54:50.354 --> 54:54.692
Do you mind if
I walk with you today?

54:54.775 --> 54:57.570
Ilkka's having his period
or something.

55:01.407 --> 55:05.620
Come along. Yay! Great.

55:07.788 --> 55:13.211
<i>Day 3. On the other hand,
why cut the journey short?</i>

55:21.969 --> 55:24.138
Hi. Hi.

55:25.348 --> 55:30.478
I have to say you played well
yesterday, and voluntarily.

55:30.561 --> 55:35.358
That takes some time management,
with little kids and all.

55:35.441 --> 55:40.029
You have time to come
running after a ball and drinking.

55:40.112 --> 55:43.574
You even have time
to flirt with Mikko.

55:43.658 --> 55:46.869
I respect that.
Right back at you.

55:46.953 --> 55:50.498
It's nice that you haven't let
your autism limit you.

55:50.581 --> 55:53.668
You keep up with the others.

55:53.751 --> 55:57.672
It's nice that you have
sheltered work with your uncle.

55:59.757 --> 56:03.261
Right. Before today's games...

56:03.344 --> 56:09.517
Many of you probably wonder
where I disappeared last night.

56:11.185 --> 56:15.731
Shame on you.
It was a business meeting.

56:15.815 --> 56:21.821
May I introduce
our firm's new partner

56:21.904 --> 56:25.992
whose hotel's maintenance deal
will go from Kittilä Wank...

56:26.075 --> 56:29.954
sorry, Property Boys, to us.

56:30.663 --> 56:34.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
Datsuns and Ferraris

56:34.083 --> 56:37.003
Mikko from Big Mikko!

56:37.086 --> 56:39.588
Good morning, everyone.

56:40.298 --> 56:42.216
Yeah.

56:42.341 --> 56:47.638
Now that we're
part of the same team

56:47.722 --> 56:53.102
Timo and I thought that
for the rest of the tournament

56:53.185 --> 56:57.315
I should join your team in the bog
as a reinforcement.

56:57.398 --> 57:01.861
And now, as a symbolic gesture...

57:06.407 --> 57:11.996
I'm putting
on your team's yellow...

57:12.079 --> 57:15.583
The other way round.
Yeah. Shirt.

57:16.792 --> 57:18.711
Like this.

57:23.007 --> 57:26.510
This is just fantastic.

57:31.932 --> 57:37.855
<i>Welcome to Vuokatti
and the second day of Swamp Soccer!</i>

57:38.439 --> 57:42.109
<i>In field 3,
there will be a wild ride.</i>

57:42.193 --> 57:44.945
<i>The newcomer,
Kolari Property Services</i>

57:45.029 --> 57:48.991
<i>will meet the two time champion
of the firm tournament</i>

57:49.075 --> 57:52.078
<i>Kittilä' Property Boys!</i>

57:53.371 --> 57:56.207
You're so going to die.

57:56.290 --> 57:59.251
Especially you, traitor!

58:07.510 --> 58:09.595
<i>The game looks extremely dirty.</i>

58:09.678 --> 58:14.517
<i>Socks, legs, and shins are assaulted.</i>

58:14.600 --> 58:20.606
<i>That's forbidden, especially
with studs first! Outrageous!</i>

58:31.242 --> 58:35.371
Pass the ball! Over here!

58:35.454 --> 58:41.335
<i>Looks like the Property Boys
are in complete control of the game.</i>

58:41.419 --> 58:44.922
<i>Looks like 10! Yes!</i>

58:46.674 --> 58:49.468
Substitution!

58:52.763 --> 58:58.144
Hi. If you're looking for
a more dynamic team at some point

58:58.227 --> 59:00.020
give me a call.

59:00.104 --> 59:05.526
<i>20 for Kittilä. What a rough ride!</i>

59:05.609 --> 59:12.158
<i>First aid team,
you're needed in field 2...</i>

59:16.287 --> 59:19.582
<i>Maybe I'm not useless after all.</i>

59:19.665 --> 59:23.919
<i>What if there's just
something lacking from my life?</i>

59:24.670 --> 59:29.049
<i>Maybe I'm not touched enough,
at home.</i>

59:37.933 --> 59:42.605
Phew. I feel hot.

59:46.692 --> 59:50.070
How about some naturism? I'm in.

59:51.864 --> 59:55.534
Come on, guys. Let's fool around.
Fool around?

59:56.952 --> 01:00:00.873
Your fooling around cost me
all my water. I'm thirsty.

01:00:00.956 --> 01:00:03.667
UP field!

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:08.589
<i>The game has been ugly...
Let me see</i> some <i>blood!</i>

01:00:11.717 --> 01:00:17.765
Inari is on form today.
Yeah. I hope she doesn't get hurt.

01:00:20.476 --> 01:00:22.811
She's pregnant.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:29.777
Is she? I heard her talking
to Saana last night.

01:00:31.612 --> 01:00:35.157
She didn't drink anything.
Substitution!

01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:49.004
I mailed you my CV.
Did you get a chance to look at it?

01:00:49.088 --> 01:00:52.007
Yeah. It looked good. Good.

01:00:52.091 --> 01:00:56.720
I'll keep you in mind
if something opens up sometime.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:01.058
Go, go!

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:09.400
You can't consider me for
Uolevi's position? Well... no.

01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:13.404
As I said, it's been promised to Kai.

01:01:13.487 --> 01:01:17.491
Good, good! Go for it!

01:01:18.367 --> 01:01:21.453
Alright! Let me see some blood!

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:26.709
<i>Beer'.</i>

01:01:30.879 --> 01:01:34.008
Mind if I join you?

01:01:36.135 --> 01:01:39.263
Damn, we play well together.
Like in the old clays

01:01:39.346 --> 01:01:43.851
when we played NHL 95
on my Sega, remember?

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:50.232
Do you mind if I join you guys
at the cottage tonight?

01:01:50.316 --> 01:01:52.484
Timo invited me.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:57.531
I thought I'd check with you first
if it's okay.

01:01:57.656 --> 01:02:03.954
We could talk things through
honestly, so there won't be any...

01:02:04.038 --> 01:02:09.918
Yeah, let's talk.
Why don't we talk right now?

01:02:10.002 --> 01:02:14.465
I'm uncomfortable with you making
some Greek girl my lookalike.

01:02:14.548 --> 01:02:18.927
And you giving your maintenance deal
to Kolari Property Services

01:02:19.011 --> 01:02:22.890
just to get a chance
to play with me for two days!

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:27.019
Mikko... I will never, ever

01:02:27.102 --> 01:02:30.230
under any circumstances
date you again.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:34.777
Mikko, you're a very little, sad man!

01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:39.782
Do you understand?
Besides, I love Janne.

01:02:39.865 --> 01:02:42.910
Maybe not always, but usually.

01:02:47.039 --> 01:02:50.876
Was this honest enough for you?

01:03:07.142 --> 01:03:13.399
There went the future of this firm.
If that was it, good riddance.

01:03:40.342 --> 01:03:43.178
Water! Water!

01:03:43.262 --> 01:03:47.641
I need food quickly.
Do we have anything?

01:03:47.766 --> 01:03:50.352
What?

01:03:50.436 --> 01:03:54.732
Has someone taken my insulin?
Your what?

01:03:56.316 --> 01:04:00.154
My insulin syringe.
I have type 2 diabetes.

01:04:00.779 --> 01:04:05.075
Why haven't you told me?
I threw it away. What?

01:04:05.159 --> 01:04:08.662
I thought you were shooting
hormones. Really?

01:04:10.497 --> 01:04:14.209
Sweet water!
Should we boil it first?

01:04:14.293 --> 01:04:18.338
Your mama boiled water
when she was making you!

01:04:19.965 --> 01:04:23.427
Fuck... Is it fresh?

01:04:57.002 --> 01:04:59.546
Are you finished with your games?

01:04:59.922 --> 01:05:04.259
Would you like to see a proper party?
Join us on our island.

01:05:04.343 --> 01:05:07.012
There's food, drink, Dj, and all.

01:05:07.095 --> 01:05:09.598
Shall we go?

01:05:11.225 --> 01:05:15.437
I'd like to come. Welcome.

01:05:15.521 --> 01:05:19.483
<i>Muscles are sore,
but tomorrow is the last day...</i>

01:05:20.025 --> 01:05:23.237
Inari!

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.825
We'll talk later.
What the hell?

01:05:30.202 --> 01:05:34.832
We'll get back to the trail through
there. Isn't it in that direction?

01:05:34.915 --> 01:05:38.293
I need something with sugar quickly.

01:05:38.377 --> 01:05:42.422
Let's think outside the box.
What if we don't go to Pallas?

01:05:42.506 --> 01:05:45.717
The Raattama road
is in that direction.

01:05:45.843 --> 01:05:48.971
We can hitch a ride to Levi.
Goddammit!

01:06:13.078 --> 01:06:18.667
I remember the summer I worked
as a hostess on a heritage cruise.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:22.337
In Kemi.
It was very challenging work.

01:06:22.421 --> 01:06:27.634
I was the best hostess they'd had.
How about we throttle up?

01:06:29.136 --> 01:06:31.471
This engine has some torque!

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:52.200
Your opponent didn't show up,
so the last game goes to you.

01:06:52.284 --> 01:06:55.829
It means you advance
from your division with two wins.

01:06:55.954 --> 01:07:00.125
Congratulations.
Without a single goal?

01:07:02.836 --> 01:07:04.296
Where's Mikko?

01:07:06.632 --> 01:07:10.427
Can someone please help me out?

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:22.481
Hey...

01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:15.617
Let's quickly get him
some warm, dry clothes.

01:08:16.033 --> 01:08:18.495
Timo... Yes?

01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:22.666
Something white.

01:08:31.299 --> 01:08:37.096
The path runs behind that peak.
This will save us five kilometres.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.475
I'm feeling a bit weak.

01:08:42.019 --> 01:08:46.689
We'll cook some porridge if we don't
meet anyone. We still have some left.

01:08:46.773 --> 01:08:51.944
Is this quite safe?
Let's just enjoy the journey.

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:56.533
I'm enjoying the hell out of it.

01:09:17.679 --> 01:09:19.890
Goddammit!

01:09:22.975 --> 01:09:26.772
Did you hurt yourself? My knee!

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.276
Does it hurt?

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:34.738
Don't touch it!

01:09:37.448 --> 01:09:40.660
Does it look bad?

01:10:54.651 --> 01:11:00.782
Yeah... Nothing to worry about.
It's just dislocated.

01:11:00.866 --> 01:11:05.620
Feels kind of funny.
We can't carry you anywhere.

01:11:08.415 --> 01:11:11.585
I'll pull from here.
You take the other end, Hanna.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:17.007
Right, Tapio?
I don't feel very well.

01:11:21.553 --> 01:11:23.638
On the count of three.

01:11:24.764 --> 01:11:29.436
Yep. One, two...

01:11:30.228 --> 01:11:32.105
Three.

01:11:33.982 --> 01:11:38.653
Does it stretch, goddammit?

01:11:46.244 --> 01:11:48.830
Did you hear a crack?

01:11:58.924 --> 01:12:03.220
The strangling hand. I've clone it
at the kids' birthday parties.

01:12:11.436 --> 01:12:15.941
Quite a shindig you have here.
Isn't it?

01:12:17.067 --> 01:12:20.904
Whenever I've worked
in personnel management

01:12:20.987 --> 01:12:24.157
I've spared no effort
in arranging these events.

01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:30.789
After all, an open bar is
a big carrot for many employees.

01:12:31.206 --> 01:12:34.626
Or... You have lots of other things,
too.

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:39.756
And I'm not into drinking myself.
I have two children.

01:12:40.382 --> 01:12:44.970
I don't want to tire myself
like that anymore.

01:12:45.053 --> 01:12:49.307
You have an interesting firm here.

01:12:50.058 --> 01:12:52.644
I was just wondering...

01:12:54.354 --> 01:12:58.400
I'm sorry...

01:12:58.483 --> 01:13:01.653
I guess I've made
a dumb impression of myself.

01:13:01.736 --> 01:13:07.617
I don't usually babble like this,
but... Can we start over?

01:13:08.702 --> 01:13:10.954
Don't sweat it.

01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:15.500
We can talk about work
next week, okay?

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:19.587
Let's just relax
and enjoy ourselves now.

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:24.384
I'm sorry, I was an idiot.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:27.971
I'm just longing to go back to work.

01:13:28.763 --> 01:13:32.183
I can't stay at home anymore.
I'll go crazy.

01:13:32.267 --> 01:13:37.230
I'd be ready to do anything,
anything at all.

01:13:42.193 --> 01:13:46.072
The men's sauna is ready.
Just a moment.

01:13:51.369 --> 01:13:55.081
Sorry, what were you insinuating?

01:13:55.165 --> 01:14:01.087
I mean... Not again!
I guess this is my curse.

01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:04.257
I'm aware of my sex appeal

01:14:04.382 --> 01:14:07.594
but is it really that irresistible?

01:14:08.303 --> 01:14:11.181
I mean... What did she insinuate?

01:14:11.264 --> 01:14:17.437
She said she'd do anything
if I employed her.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.107
Yeah, any kind of work!
And then she put her hands on me.

01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:23.318
She also threatened to beat us up.

01:14:23.443 --> 01:14:30.158
You're saying it wasn't
a sexual hint? No, it wasn't!

01:14:30.241 --> 01:14:34.746
Besides, the atmosphere here
is quite sexual anyway.

01:14:34.829 --> 01:14:39.417
Excuse me?
Pole dancers and show girls...

01:14:39.501 --> 01:14:43.755
Dad, what are you talking about?
Hold on, honey. Daddy's working.

01:14:44.214 --> 01:14:47.801
It's my daughter's
competitive pole dancing team!

01:14:47.884 --> 01:14:51.179
How can you see it as sexual?

01:14:52.305 --> 01:14:56.768
Those people bathing and...
And those...

01:14:57.936 --> 01:15:03.441
They have atopic eczema!
Hot baths relieve it. Yeah!

01:15:03.983 --> 01:15:06.945
Erja, come here!

01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:11.866
Care to repeat what you just said?
This is my wife.

01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:13.993
There's a ring under this glove.

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:17.705
We have zero tolerance of
all forms of sexual harassment.

01:15:17.789 --> 01:15:20.750
It's been a matter of honour!

01:15:24.879 --> 01:15:28.258
I'm sorry... Can I go now?

01:15:28.341 --> 01:15:31.803
No, you can't.
We're going to settle this. Dj!

01:15:31.886 --> 01:15:34.514
Sorry, honey. Turn off the music!

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:37.434
Did she really come on to you? No!

01:15:41.688 --> 01:15:48.653
Hey! Sorry about the interruption.
May I have your attention?

01:15:48.736 --> 01:15:52.449
Our weekend's theme
has been equality

01:15:52.532 --> 01:15:57.328
and now we happen to have
a bad example

01:15:57.454 --> 01:16:02.917
of the kind of sexual harassment
our firm doesn't tolerate at all.

01:16:03.001 --> 01:16:07.505
There she is!
This is the woman I'm talking about.

01:16:07.589 --> 01:16:11.926
She doesn't have any dignity.
You can't behave any way you please!

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:17.807
That's our sunlounger!
You have quite a way to go!

01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:23.605
Take that, slag!
Keep rowing!

01:16:35.074 --> 01:16:39.329
Storms pass quickly out here.
I'll cook us some porridge.

01:16:40.663 --> 01:16:44.959
He's going to faint!
I'm sorry I ruined your hike!

01:16:45.043 --> 01:16:51.299
This isn't your fault. I know
you didn't want me to come along!

01:16:51.382 --> 01:16:56.596
I didn't want anyone to come along!
I wasn't invited to Kapu's funeral!

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:59.390
You didn't even know him!

01:17:00.975 --> 01:17:04.187
Tapio, goddammit!
Write a joik about this.

01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:07.398
I know I can never fill Kapu's place!

01:17:07.524 --> 01:17:12.904
I'll always be just the fatso
from Pelkosenniemi! What?

01:17:12.987 --> 01:17:16.282
We're all going to die!
No, we're not!

01:17:16.366 --> 01:17:19.994
You're laughing at Beatron!
It's the stream water.

01:17:20.078 --> 01:17:23.873
There's nothing to worry about.
This is normal out here.

01:17:23.957 --> 01:17:26.543
We live in Lapland!

01:17:32.674 --> 01:17:37.387
I'm sorry, honey.
Mummy's been a little absent.

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.932
Mummy's been at home so long...

01:17:46.145 --> 01:17:49.691
And I've been with Daddy so long.

01:17:49.774 --> 01:17:52.652
Listen. Don't give the phone
to Grandma yet.

01:17:59.826 --> 01:18:05.957
And Mummy's uterus is prolapsed.
That's troubling, too.

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.835
Honey?

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.512
I want to go home!

01:18:27.395 --> 01:18:30.231
Inari!

01:19:20.198 --> 01:19:23.368
Are you alive?

01:19:51.104 --> 01:19:53.815
I'll look for some firewood.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.506
Change into a dry shirt.

01:20:29.225 --> 01:20:32.270
There. One more.

01:20:32.353 --> 01:20:35.481
Open your mouth.
Here comes the helicopter.

01:20:44.657 --> 01:20:48.995
Kämy? Did you shit your pants?

01:20:54.584 --> 01:20:57.462
Kämy, I can smell it from here.

01:21:02.258 --> 01:21:05.511
Right. I guess it's my turn.

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:12.894
It's nothing. just some shit.

01:21:36.876 --> 01:21:42.548
You go on ahead. I'll take a taxi
and come to cheer you on.

01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:45.301
Alright.

01:21:55.895 --> 01:21:59.273
It's Mikko.

01:22:02.652 --> 01:22:06.656
Can I come in? No!

01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:20.878
You know... I fell into
a boghole yesterday.

01:22:20.962 --> 01:22:23.589
For a moment, I thought I'd died.

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:27.969
It made me look at things
from a different perspective.

01:22:28.052 --> 01:22:32.515
You were right.
I made the deal because of you.

01:22:32.598 --> 01:22:35.852
But I canceled it.

01:22:38.062 --> 01:22:43.651
And I broke up with Penelope.
It wasn't true love.

01:22:43.734 --> 01:22:48.948
Would you like to tell me
why you're in there?

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:52.743
I had my eye on
the Personnel Manager position

01:22:52.827 --> 01:22:54.954
with Kolari Property Services.

01:22:55.037 --> 01:22:59.458
I was even mad enough to
ask for a job with the Property Boys.

01:23:00.084 --> 01:23:07.008
I don't know. Why am I even
dreaming of going to work?

01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:10.303
Ilja can't even walk properly.

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:14.473
I don't know if I can put him
in daycare just yet.

01:23:14.557 --> 01:23:17.977
Janne will operate the lifts
again in the winter.

01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:23.024
On the other hand, I'm frustrated
as hell to stay at home.

01:23:23.107 --> 01:23:30.072
I feel like my head will explode,
washing poopy butts all day.

01:23:30.323 --> 01:23:34.118
Listen, your heroism lies in...

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:38.873
that you're a mother.

01:23:39.498 --> 01:23:44.337
Stay home.
The children are small only once.

01:23:47.381 --> 01:23:53.512
My mother sacrificed her career
and stayed home for me

01:23:53.596 --> 01:23:56.223
even though it was difficult for her.

01:23:56.307 --> 01:23:59.310
Had she not made that sacrifice...

01:24:01.312 --> 01:24:04.941
I wouldn't be the man
that I am today.

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.082
Where are you going?

01:24:27.171 --> 01:24:29.548
Help!

01:25:16.429 --> 01:25:19.098
Do you have a phone?

01:25:19.181 --> 01:25:23.019
Our friend has a dislocated knee,
and we need to call for help.

01:25:23.102 --> 01:25:27.857
Sure. Do you mind running with us
while you call? That's fine.

01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:32.570
Where are we exactly?

01:25:32.653 --> 01:25:39.118
I'm going back.
Good. Bye. Thank you.

01:25:43.456 --> 01:25:45.791
Hello.

01:25:54.717 --> 01:25:58.804
Yesterday was child's play.
You lost 40.

01:25:59.847 --> 01:26:04.060
Now the boys feel
that playtime is over.

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:09.065
You may as well surrender,
so no one gets hurt.

01:26:09.148 --> 01:26:14.653
You'll get VIP tickets to the sauna
and free reindeer sausage and chips.

01:26:14.737 --> 01:26:16.864
That's right.

01:26:18.783 --> 01:26:21.952
That's a great offer.
I agree.

01:26:22.078 --> 01:26:24.580
Hey!

01:26:26.082 --> 01:26:28.125
I'm sorry I disappeared yesterday

01:26:28.209 --> 01:26:32.296
but I have a couple of new ideas.

01:26:32.379 --> 01:26:38.094
Maybe even good ones.
Keep on brown nosing.

01:26:39.136 --> 01:26:42.473
But whose side is she really on?

01:26:45.643 --> 01:26:50.481
Sometimes you have to stop
beating your head against the wall.

01:26:50.564 --> 01:26:54.652
Hey, you have a great team
that is willing to work hard.

01:26:54.735 --> 01:26:59.156
We don't need Big Mikko.
Let's not give up!

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:01.784
Let me be the captain.

01:27:01.867 --> 01:27:04.537
Let's show those wankers.

01:27:05.621 --> 01:27:07.623
I second that.

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:13.504
We can't change things up like this.
I'm interested too.

01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:19.510
Well... Let's sweeten the deal.

01:27:20.511 --> 01:27:23.514
VIP tickets to Swamp Rock.

01:27:24.306 --> 01:27:28.477
And two drinks of choice for each.

01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:31.188
Three drinks.

01:27:32.523 --> 01:27:35.359
That's possible.

01:27:35.442 --> 01:27:38.779
Timo... No.

01:27:40.322 --> 01:27:42.616
Well, but...

01:27:45.369 --> 01:27:47.663
No!

01:28:01.886 --> 01:28:06.515
The porridge did me good.
From which direction will it come?

01:28:06.599 --> 01:28:11.645
Is it a long way to Pallas?
About 20 kilometres. Why?

01:28:11.729 --> 01:28:17.610
I was just thinking. They won't take
others aboard the chopper.

01:28:17.693 --> 01:28:23.032
I think I'll walk to Rihmakuru.
I bet Ilkka is waiting for me there.

01:28:23.115 --> 01:28:28.537
And we haven't scattered the ashes.
I blew them up, too.

01:28:28.621 --> 01:28:31.290
Shit happens.

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:38.047
Let's go.
You don't have to join me.

01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:42.384
Do you still have those mushrooms?

01:28:46.263 --> 01:28:50.851
<i>Target spotted, but there's
something we didn't expect.</i>

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:56.941
<i>The target is limping towards Pallas
and flipping us the bird.</i>

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:10.454
You're clearly a great dad.
I don't know about that.

01:29:10.537 --> 01:29:15.125
No, you are! I've been thinking
about our baby plans.

01:29:15.251 --> 01:29:17.836
When I saw what you did out there...

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:24.343
I don't know if Ilkka's got what it
takes. Men mature so goddamn slowly.

01:29:28.138 --> 01:29:30.182
Hey, listen...

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.108
I'm sorry.

01:29:40.859 --> 01:29:45.281
These things come and go in life.
This has been a great experience.

01:29:56.959 --> 01:30:00.462
Have a good life, Hanna.

01:30:00.546 --> 01:30:03.382
This is wonderful!

01:30:07.428 --> 01:30:09.430
Ilkka!

01:30:10.806 --> 01:30:14.059
We need to talk.
It seems so.

01:30:14.601 --> 01:30:20.065
Okay. Did we come here
to lose or win? We came!

01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:23.861
That's actually good. Huh?

01:30:23.944 --> 01:30:27.031
Well? We came!

01:31:06.987 --> 01:31:10.991
<i>Kittilä' Property Boys scored.
It's 10.</i>

01:31:15.788 --> 01:31:17.539
Go, go!

01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:27.383
20.

01:31:28.175 --> 01:31:30.636
<i>30 for Kittilä.</i>

01:31:32.888 --> 01:31:35.015
<i>40.</i>

01:31:45.567 --> 01:31:49.947
<i>50.60.</i>

01:31:52.658 --> 01:31:57.037
<i>Looks like the ball
is completely free.</i>

01:31:57.121 --> 01:31:59.665
<i>Why isn't anything happening?</i>

01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:02.418
<i>But what's happening now?</i>

01:32:02.501 --> 01:32:08.674
<i>A player from Kolari
Property Services nimbly sets off!</i>

01:32:08.757 --> 01:32:12.970
<i>But no, he gets stuck
and can't do anything!</i>

01:32:13.053 --> 01:32:18.684
<i>And he proceeds again!
He gets to the ball...</i>

01:32:18.767 --> 01:32:21.228
<i>And he scores!</i>

01:32:21.311 --> 01:32:24.022
<i>Kolari Property Services score!</i>

01:32:24.106 --> 01:32:30.154
<i>Their first goal in this tournament!
81!</i>

01:32:38.745 --> 01:32:41.123
The match isn't over!

01:32:57.723 --> 01:33:00.726
Well? Is everything okay?

01:33:05.731 --> 01:33:08.734
I wish you all the best regardless.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.864
Can we be friends? Yes.

01:33:20.704 --> 01:33:23.207
Mikko? Yeah?

01:33:25.542 --> 01:33:30.923
<i>Do you have a harden'?
Rs 'gust a reflex.</i>

01:33:39.014 --> 01:33:42.100
Help. I'm dying-

01:33:42.643 --> 01:33:47.523
Give me some toilet paper.
I really need to take a dump.

01:33:47.606 --> 01:33:50.526
You blew that up, too.

01:33:53.737 --> 01:33:56.698
Have a crisp. No, thanks.

01:34:11.255 --> 01:34:14.550
The Helsinki Olympic Flame
was lit on this site

01:34:14.633 --> 01:34:17.844
We're here! What?

01:34:17.928 --> 01:34:22.933
We reached the summit!
Did we?

01:34:23.559 --> 01:34:26.311
Wonderful!

01:34:30.566 --> 01:34:33.527
Can't we bury something?

01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:38.365
Yeah. Since the ashes
were left behind.

01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:46.707
Let's bury this.

01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.304
It's still showing.

01:35:12.774 --> 01:35:15.068
Do you feel better?

01:35:17.321 --> 01:35:22.909
I know what I'm going to do
once I've bench pressed 150 kilos.

01:35:23.243 --> 01:35:26.371
I'll try for 170 kilos.

01:35:27.289 --> 01:35:31.585
I need to stop daydreaming
and go to work.

01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:34.421
Why?

01:35:35.589 --> 01:35:38.759
Beatron is a bloody good invention.

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.306
You think so?
It's really good.

01:35:48.518 --> 01:35:54.024
I think we're done here.
Or is there something else?

01:36:15.962 --> 01:36:22.052
Backwater town begins KOLARI

01:36:27.974 --> 01:36:33.522
It's great to get home
and sleep in our own beds.

01:36:33.605 --> 01:36:38.360
Daddy's looking forward to it. What?

01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:44.324
What did you say?

01:36:48.412 --> 01:36:52.374
Oh my. What's this smell of burning?

01:36:55.794 --> 01:36:59.673
Come here! Let's get out quickly!

01:37:00.382 --> 01:37:02.884
Kolari, Kolari, Kolari...

01:37:05.971 --> 01:37:09.850
I decided to make Inari
the new Personnel Manager.

01:37:09.933 --> 01:37:15.564
She had concrete development ideas.
So there.

01:37:15.647 --> 01:37:20.861
You'll be her standin
when she's on maternity leave.

01:37:49.097 --> 01:37:51.558
The house is on fire.

01:38:05.614 --> 01:38:08.658
I was thinking about all this. So...

01:38:08.742 --> 01:38:12.704
Have you tampered with this?
I'm clone with the ski lifts.

01:38:14.456 --> 01:38:18.293
I have the right to stay home
with the kids. I'll manage.

01:38:20.837 --> 01:38:25.008
I thought you were dying
to work there. Fuck, no.

01:38:25.759 --> 01:38:30.680
Well, you're better with the kids
these clays than I am.

01:38:32.599 --> 01:38:36.061
I'm going back to work. Okay.

01:38:36.394 --> 01:38:41.274
You were against it.
Why would I be against it?

01:38:41.358 --> 01:38:45.153
No insurance will cover this.

01:38:48.073 --> 01:38:51.785
I guess we need
a digital television set now.

01:38:59.793 --> 01:39:02.504
Crazy people.

01:39:10.428 --> 01:39:14.474
I think we can sleep
in the bedroom tomorrow.

01:39:14.558 --> 01:39:17.686
There's a good draught.

01:39:19.521 --> 01:39:24.317
Honey? First the sausage,
then the sweet.

01:39:24.401 --> 01:39:26.528
Good.

01:39:30.490 --> 01:39:33.159
Shall we have a sausage?

01:39:36.162 --> 01:39:39.124
The kitchen cabinets burn well.

01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:45.297
<i>July 17th, 2017. Day 1.</i>

01:39:46.089 --> 01:39:48.758
<i>Yeah...</i>

01:39:48.842 --> 01:39:53.263
<i>I need to borrow Kämy's trailer
and buy some white paint.</i>

01:39:53.346 --> 01:39:56.224
<i>And a new charger
for the power drill.</i>

01:39:56.308 --> 01:39:59.561
<i>Plaster boards,
50millimetre screws and plugs</i>

01:39:59.644 --> 01:40:03.064
<i>joint tape, laminate flooring,
skirting board...</i>

01:40:03.148 --> 01:40:09.946
<i>Oh, and refuse bags,
a stronger crowbar, work gloves.</i>

01:40:12.073 --> 01:40:17.454
<i>And something nice for Inari.
Some pick 'n' mix sweets.</i>

01:43:06.289 --> 01:43:08.875
