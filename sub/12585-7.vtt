00:31.698 --> 00:34.576
<i>You too can be rich like Dr. Money</i>

00:34.659 --> 00:38.204
<i>and have champagne for breakfast
and caviar for your cats.</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:40.373
<i>How much return do you
want for your investment?</i>

00:41.499 --> 00:43.043
No, thanks.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.794
<i>200 percent?</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:46.296
<i>Okay, Mr. Hard Bargain, 400 percent!</i>

00:51.634 --> 00:53.887
<i>Of course, walking to mailbox not so easy</i>

00:54.471 --> 00:56.473
<i>when your mansion's this big!</i>

00:59.934 --> 01:01.811
That could have been me under there.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.730
I could have died last night.

01:03.813 --> 01:04.898
A bed, huh?

01:04.981 --> 01:07.067
I always pictured you sleeping in a pile

01:07.150 --> 01:09.402
of shredded newspaper like a hamster.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.990
Boy, facing your own mortality
really makes you think.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.534
Feels like someone's trying
to tell me something.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.787
Yeah, that was me six months ago

01:18.870 --> 01:21.289
when I said you needed
to get your roof inspected.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.290
No, Hank.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.501
My roof caving in happened for a reason.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.587
It wasn't to kill me,
it was to wake me up.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.340
I've been spared for some
greater purpose, but what?

01:31.466 --> 01:32.926
Why am I here?

01:33.009 --> 01:35.095
Tell you what, man,
talkin' 'bout ol' meaning of life, man.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.138
Go read that ol' <i>Hitchhiker's Guide,</i> man.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.766
Talk, talkin' 'bout ol' four... 42, man.

01:39.849 --> 01:43.228
Look, Bill, you're just shaken up
'cause you lost a good roof.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.855
All you need is a home
maintenance organizer.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.273
I'll make you a binder.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.651
Thanks, but what I need is meaning,

01:49.734 --> 01:51.361
and there's no binder for that.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.238
Look, Bill, I'm on your deathbed.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.324
Now I'm bouncing on your deathbed.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.082
Maybe Bill's purpose in life
should be to proofread the bulletin.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.627
-Apparently, spell-check is a sin.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.754
Hey, Hank. Can you scooch over?

02:10.380 --> 02:12.799
Come on, Bill.
It's kind of tight in here already.

02:12.882 --> 02:16.511
I can't focus on God
if I'm afraid we're going to touch knees.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.847
Please? I promise I won't spread.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.643
Good morning.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.563
Before we begin,
I'd like to share some thoughts

02:26.646 --> 02:28.606
about last week's church breakfast.

02:28.731 --> 02:32.443
Normally, I don't take it personally
when people don't participate,

02:32.527 --> 02:35.113
but when you're sitting alone
with 300 pancakes,

02:35.238 --> 02:36.948
you can't help but take stock.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.410
Anyway, after a glass of Merlot
and a good cry,

02:40.493 --> 02:42.745
I realized, "Hey, I'm not a quitter."

02:42.829 --> 02:46.166
So I've come up with
some fantastic new activities,

02:46.249 --> 02:47.917
and they're listed in your bulletins.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.589
Hey, there's something
every night of the week,

02:52.672 --> 02:53.923
sometimes two things.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.677
Something's happening to me, Hank,
something wonderful.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.429
Uh, okay.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.472
I think I've found my purpose.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.183
It's here in the church.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.268
Reverend Stroup needs people
to get involved,

03:05.351 --> 03:06.519
and that's what I'm gonna do.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.104
Good for you, Bill.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.273
Uh, I know you're excited,

03:10.356 --> 03:13.610
but I'm gonna need at least
a hymnal's width between us.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.279
Sorry.

03:18.781 --> 03:23.703
Everyone, we have a new addition
to our Bible study, Bill Dauterive.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.830
We're happy to have you with us, Bill.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.457
I'm happy to be here.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.210
God told me to come here tonight.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.712
No, no, no, not in a crazy way.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.631
It was purely inspirational.

03:34.714 --> 03:39.135
Okay, does anyone here have any thoughts
about this week's reading?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.971
Yeah, I, I still don't understand
how Abraham could wait a hundred years

03:42.055 --> 03:43.139
before God gave him a son.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.016
I've been waiting four years
for a promotion,

03:45.099 --> 03:46.434
and my head's about to explode.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.811
Oh, good, we're talking
about your job again.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.981
Well, it's better than talking about
your tomato plants for the 15th time.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.400
I think the story's about patience.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.902
Being patient is hard,

03:55.985 --> 03:57.862
but if you're waiting
for something really great,

03:57.946 --> 03:58.821
it's worth it.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.617
Thank you, Bill.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.744
I couldn't have said it better myself.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.084
Huh. Hmm.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.503
Really. Wow.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.255
Bill, I'm tired of holding your beer.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.507
This hand isn't used to being cold.

04:17.590 --> 04:21.177
Sorry, just brushing up
on my First and Second Timothy.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.638
So I guess you found
what you were looking for

04:23.721 --> 04:24.889
there at the church, huh?

04:24.973 --> 04:27.308
You know, purpose and whatnot?

04:27.433 --> 04:28.351
Oh, it's great.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.728
I've got Bible study three nights a week,

04:30.812 --> 04:32.981
"Apostles and Donuts" on Tuesday mornings,

04:33.064 --> 04:34.857
and this Sunday, I'm starting a class

04:34.941 --> 04:36.901
about the biblical truths in <i>Narnia.</i>

04:36.985 --> 04:39.654
Wow, Bill, that is a lot of God.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.780
I know.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.448
I think I've found my calling.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.952
I can't wait to teach the Bible
to people all over the world.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.829
Uh, the world?

04:47.912 --> 04:48.746
Oh, sure.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.124
The church organizes
mission trips all over.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.126
Haiti, Romania, Nigeria.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.044
Then, maybe I'll spend a couple of years

04:55.128 --> 04:57.922
in a Methodist monastery
to really hone my skills.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.924
And Bill's off the rails.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.592
Now hang on, Bill.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.762
You can't go jumping in headfirst
like you usually do.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.349
Before you become a minister
and run off to Africa,

05:08.433 --> 05:11.311
maybe you should try to find
what you're looking for right here.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.855
Okay, but really, it's not up to me,

05:13.938 --> 05:16.774
so don't get mad
if you're overruled by God.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.742
Morning. Beautiful Sunday, isn't it?

05:25.825 --> 05:28.036
Nice Bible, Mr. Dauterive.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.913
Thanks. It's waterproof, tear-proof.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.167
The guy at the store said
it could survive the Apocalypse.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.962
I guess you needed something more durable
for those mission trips, huh?

05:38.046 --> 05:41.090
Oh, no, those are off, Hank.
I'm not going anywhere.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.967
Really? Thank God.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.846
I had a long talk with Reverend Stroup
and decided you were right.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.098
My purpose is right here in Arlen.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.434
Everything I need is in this church,

05:51.517 --> 05:54.812
all wrapped up with a green satin stole.

05:54.937 --> 05:59.692
Well, that's a weird way to put it,
but I'm glad you came to your senses.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.195
Uh, do you want me to scoot over?

06:02.278 --> 06:04.947
No, thanks. I'm gonna grab
a seat closer to the front.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.618
Good morning.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.119
Our Old Testament reading

06:10.203 --> 06:13.122
can be found on page 451
of your pew Bibles.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.832
Let us hear the Word.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.294
"Let him kiss me
with the kisses of his mouth,

06:18.419 --> 06:21.130
for your love is better than the wine."

06:21.214 --> 06:23.383
Uh, what is this?

06:23.466 --> 06:24.967
Song of Solomon.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.096
Isn't it a little PG-13 for church?

06:28.679 --> 06:29.680
Shh!

06:31.265 --> 06:34.769
"You have ravished my heart
with one look of your eyes..."

06:36.562 --> 06:38.189
"I am my beloved's,

06:39.232 --> 06:41.818
and his desire is toward me..."

06:48.116 --> 06:49.575
No!

06:54.080 --> 06:58.042
Uh, I, uh...
Sorry, I dropped my Bible here.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.886
Bill, open up.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.889
Bill, I know what's going on here.

07:11.973 --> 07:15.601
You and Reverend Stroup are... involved.

07:15.726 --> 07:16.978
That's crazy, Hank.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.897
I don't know what you're talking about.
Pfff, crazy.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.859
Come on, Bill.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.612
You can come out. He knows.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.036
Relax, Hank.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.288
I won't bite.

07:35.371 --> 07:38.666
Unless you want her to.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.169
Sorry. Poorly timed joke,
completely inappropriate,

07:41.252 --> 07:42.462
don't even know if it's true.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.592
Hank, it's okay,
ministers are allowed to date.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.886
I'm not just a person of God.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.387
I'm a woman, too.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.432
Uh, I wouldn't know anything about that.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.393
Still, I've found that
congregations can be less than accepting

07:57.477 --> 07:59.228
when it comes to this type of situation.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.646
Why do you think I left St. Paul?

08:00.813 --> 08:03.941
So if you wouldn't mind,
can we keep this just between us?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.405
All right.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.781
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

08:11.782 --> 08:16.496
I gotta go mow or water or something.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.750
I like that song, too.
She sings like an angel.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.251
Who could Bill be talking to?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.920
We're all right here.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.923
Uh, it's probably just work.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.384
Sorry, fellas.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.721
That's okay. We were just, uh...

08:33.804 --> 08:35.389
Hello.

08:35.473 --> 08:38.434
Hi... Uh, General.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.479
Sorry, I have to take this.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.027
Drake.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.029
Hank!

08:53.074 --> 08:54.700
Hi, everybody!

08:54.825 --> 08:56.035
Hank, we need to talk.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.453
Hey, Mr. Dauterive,

08:57.537 --> 09:00.665
I think Joseph and I
saw you out at Lake Arlen today

09:00.748 --> 09:02.124
when we were riding bikes.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.544
Uh, I'm sure it was someone else.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.505
Mr. Dauterive has a very common shape.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.924
It sure looked like him.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.093
He was in his car with some woman.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.095
-She was a prostitute!
-Bill!

09:14.178 --> 09:16.806
Just kidding. Wasn't me.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.224
Bill, outside.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.146
What do you want, Bill?

09:24.272 --> 09:29.652
Well, as a thank you for covering for my,
you know, steamy secret relationship,

09:29.735 --> 09:31.362
I wanted to take you out to dinner.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.198
Uh, that's really not necessary.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.491
We'll go for steak.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.911
-Good steak...
-Hmm.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.956
-Prime steak...
-Hmm...

09:43.958 --> 09:45.585
Hank, don't be mad.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.752
Don't talk to me.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.212
I had to trick you.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.381
You wouldn't have come
if I'd told you Karen and I

09:50.464 --> 09:53.301
wanted a romantic evening out,
and we needed you for cover.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.638
It's so naughty
being out in public, isn't it?

09:57.722 --> 10:00.099
No one in this restaurant
knows we're an item.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.184
The secret drives me wild.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.936
How wild?

10:04.020 --> 10:06.105
-That's my foot.
-Sorry.

10:06.188 --> 10:10.026
Hey, there's one of those gypsy ladies
selling roses and Tic-Tacs.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.652
I'm gonna buy you one of each.

10:14.739 --> 10:19.035
Hank, I was thinking about taking Bill
to this cute B&B outside McMaynerbury.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.661
Can you sneak away for an overnight?

10:20.786 --> 10:24.582
What? No! Reverend Stroup,
I can't do this anymore.

10:24.665 --> 10:28.419
I don't wanna "sneak away,"
I don't wanna keep lying to everyone.

10:28.502 --> 10:29.670
And you shouldn't either.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.422
But I don't have a choice.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.591
If Bill and I want
our relationship to work,

10:33.674 --> 10:37.720
we have to keep it a secret, or boom,
it's St. Paul all over again.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.263
Well, it seems to me

10:39.347 --> 10:42.433
the things you have to keep secret
are things you shouldn't be doing.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.979
You're right, Hank. It is wrong.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.481
I'll talk to Bill tonight.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.072
Sorry, Hank. Would've looked weird
if I didn't buy one for you, too.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.120
Bobby, what are you doing?
You can't take those.

11:03.204 --> 11:07.458
But these baby envelopes
are perfect for all my little stuff.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.835
Well, you shouldn't have
any "little stuff."

11:09.919 --> 11:11.796
Now put them back.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.798
Welcome, everyone.

11:13.881 --> 11:17.134
Before we begin this morning,
I have an announcement.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.803
I hope it's the canned food drive.

11:18.886 --> 11:21.430
I can finally unload
all that pumpkin pie filling.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.558
I've been keeping a secret
from all of you,

11:24.642 --> 11:26.686
and it's time I come clean.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.523
I've been dating someone,

11:30.606 --> 11:33.109
and he's right here in this room.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.568
Oh, no.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.320
Bill?

11:36.404 --> 11:37.822
Peace be with you.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.865
Oh, my God.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.410
Hank, what's happening?

11:46.247 --> 11:49.291
This is a disaster
of biblical proportions.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.336
Now Stroup's gonna shirk
all her spiritual duties.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.963
I'm sure she won't, Dale.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.757
Aah, you know how women get
when they're in love.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.677
It's all kissy-face this, huggy-pie that.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.555
Meanwhile, who's making sure
I get into Heaven?

12:02.638 --> 12:03.889
No one.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.558
Hi, everybody.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.644
Afternoon, Bill, Reverend Stroup.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.272
Aw, Hank, please, call me Karen.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.607
Yeah, I'm, I'm not gonna do that.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.069
Relax, fellas.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.780
You don't have to be nervous around me.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.616
Dale, why don't you pass me
one of those bad boys?

12:32.334 --> 12:33.627
Hmm...

12:37.757 --> 12:40.134
Uh, I hear my dang ol' phone ringing, man.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.302
See you guys later, man.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.726
Sweetie, you've got
some beer foam on your lip.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.439
Oops, I forgot how ticklish you are.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.691
Oop, I forgot again!

12:55.775 --> 12:57.318
You are so cute.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.237
My back tire looks low.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.032
Yep, low.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.452
Uh, hey, Padre, salvation over here!

13:10.831 --> 13:13.459
I can't wait to share a popcorn with you.

13:17.671 --> 13:21.217
That's the third time tonight
I've caught people staring at us.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.135
Oh, they're just jealous of our love.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.012
People will have to get used to it.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.766
Well, hello, you two.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.185
Bill, this is Justin and Sue from church.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.937
What a surprise to see you...

13:33.437 --> 13:34.563
and you.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.566
It's date night.
We're seeing that new horror movie.

13:37.691 --> 13:41.237
I love to get scared
so I can hold on to my man.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.706
Thanks for asking me
to join the building committee.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.168
Actually, Hank, we got you here
under false pretenses.

13:56.252 --> 14:00.339
This is about Reverend Stroup
and her... relationship.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.298
Dang it.

14:01.423 --> 14:05.052
How do we put this, uh,
the two of them together... well, it's...

14:05.135 --> 14:06.095
It's gross.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.765
Look, we're not saying they can't date...

14:09.890 --> 14:11.058
I'm saying that!

14:11.141 --> 14:13.227
Okay, we wish we could say that,
but we're not.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.020
Can you just get them
to tone it down a bit?

14:17.940 --> 14:18.983
What do you mean?

14:19.066 --> 14:21.360
People have a problem
with Karen and me dating?

14:21.443 --> 14:24.488
Everyone's just having a hard time
getting used to it.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.408
Especially with the way
you guys are carrying on.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.619
I can't control how I feel, Hank.
We're in love.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.496
If I wanna kiss my woman
on the street corner,

14:32.580 --> 14:33.581
then I'm gonna do it!

14:33.706 --> 14:37.459
Now, now, calm down, Bill.
No one's saying you two can't date.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.920
What's going on?
Who's saying we can't date?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.005
Everybody!

14:41.088 --> 14:43.048
Your deacon sent Hank here to break us up!

14:43.132 --> 14:45.092
It's... ricoculous!

14:45.217 --> 14:48.387
That's not true.
No one wants to break anyone up.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.557
This is wrong, Bill.
They can't tear us apart.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.684
I know, baby. Come here.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.021
Well, I hope you're happy, Hank.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.606
You've got my Karen so riled up,

14:58.689 --> 15:00.065
she's down at the church talking

15:00.149 --> 15:02.359
to your love-hating
deacon buddies right now.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.445
They don't hate love, Bill.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.238
They just hate your love.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.534
Sweetheart, are you okay?
What did they deacon say?

15:10.659 --> 15:13.787
They said they were uncomfortable
with our relationship.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.333
So what are they gonna do to you,
stockade, public lashing?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.918
It's already done.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.546
I'm no longer the reverend
of Arlen Methodist.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.800
This is unacceptable!
They can't fire you for love.

15:26.884 --> 15:28.427
That's discrimination.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.971
They didn't fire me, Bill. I quit.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.058
We're gonna fight this.
We're gonna... Wait. What?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.434
I wasn't gonna stand there

15:35.517 --> 15:38.145
while they suggested
what we were doing is wrong.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.230
So I turned in my robe.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.776
So, our love is no longer forbidden?

15:43.859 --> 15:46.320
That's right. Isn't it wonderful?

15:46.403 --> 15:49.490
I'm gonna go start packing,
so I can move in tonight.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.283
Move in? Move in?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.118
This is so sudden.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.286
I have to, Bill.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.789
I can't live at the church
parsonage anymore.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.832
I'll see you soon.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.380
Huh.

16:04.463 --> 16:08.717
Wow, Stroup chose you over God.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.971
Huh.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.562
Well, this is the last of it.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.190
Can't get rid of me now.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.275
Uh-huh.

16:26.318 --> 16:30.990
This is nice, just you and me
living a quiet, normal life.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.492
Yeah, not having to sneak around

16:33.575 --> 16:36.203
or worry what people think
is much more relaxing.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.124
Almost boring, in fact.

16:42.292 --> 16:45.379
That shelf would be perfect
for my snow babies!

16:45.504 --> 16:46.588
Snow babies?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.967
Can someone roll me another beer?

16:50.050 --> 16:51.635
Get it yourself, Dale.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.678
No way.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.431
Stroup's ex is bound
to take vengeance on Bill,

16:55.514 --> 16:58.934
and I don't wanna be collateral damage
from one of His lightning bolts.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.103
-I don't want her in my house!
-What?

17:01.770 --> 17:03.230
I thought I wanted her,

17:03.313 --> 17:06.316
but that was when our relationship
was exciting and taboo,

17:06.400 --> 17:07.943
like Romeo and Juliet.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.529
Now we're just a normal, boring couple,

17:10.612 --> 17:12.906
and Juliet put all these
weird little snow babies

17:12.990 --> 17:14.616
-all over my house!
-Look,

17:14.700 --> 17:17.911
you can't be so quick to break it off.
She gave up a lot for you.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.538
Don't you think I know that?

17:19.621 --> 17:21.874
I thought this was all part of God's plan.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.626
But if it is, then why am I so miserable?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.211
Someone's got to be.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.338
Maybe God was tired of her, too,

17:28.422 --> 17:31.091
and his plan was to dump her
on your doorstep.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.011
Please take her back! Wait!

17:34.094 --> 17:36.513
I, I don't mean "kill her" take her back.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.892
Oh, God, what am I gonna do?
I can't break up with her.

17:39.975 --> 17:40.809
Tell you what, man,

17:40.893 --> 17:43.312
talking about get her to
break up with you, man.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.148
-That's how you do it, man.
-Brilliant, Boomhauer!

17:46.231 --> 17:48.609
Act like an ass, she dumps you,

17:48.734 --> 17:49.860
you're off the hook.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.154
Why has no one ever tried that before?

17:53.489 --> 17:54.740
You can't do that, Bill.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.617
I like being off the hook.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.871
I'm gonna do Boomhauer's idea.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.839
Honey, you barely touched your dinner.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.716
Don't you like your mashed potatoes?

18:15.469 --> 18:16.428
I've had better.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.014
I guess they are a little dry.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.974
Maybe they sat out too long.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.352
What are you trying to say,
that I was late for dinner?

18:23.435 --> 18:26.355
No! I, I just didn't know
when you were coming in from the alley.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.149
So, now I'm spending
too much time with my friends.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.567
Bill, what are you talking about?

18:30.651 --> 18:31.777
You can't change me!

18:31.860 --> 18:34.780
If I wanna hang out
in the alley and drink beer

18:34.863 --> 18:37.866
and talk about the devil,
then I'm gonna do it!

18:38.367 --> 18:40.410
If you don't like it,
then you can break up with me.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.996
-You wanna break up with me?
-I don't want to break up with you.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.123
I love you.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.917
I know.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.342
Mom, why is Mr. Dauterive
sitting out there in the dark?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.847
Hank, Bill's on the patio again!

18:59.930 --> 19:01.306
I'm on it.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.643
What's going on, Bill?

19:04.726 --> 19:06.520
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.356
I tried what Boomhauer said,
but she still won't leave me.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.401
I guess we're getting married.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.194
Bill, this is ridiculous.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.904
You can't spend the rest of your life

19:15.988 --> 19:18.699
with someone just because you're
afraid to be honest with them.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.784
But honesty's hard.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.870
I know, but it's the right thing to do.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.624
There you are, sweetie.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.626
I thought you went to get us ice cream.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.966
No, Karen, the ice cream was a lie.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.593
Sit down. We need to talk.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.970
Now? Oh, God.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.601
What's going on out there, Dad?

19:45.684 --> 19:50.397
Mr. Dauterive and Reverend Stroup
are breaking up on my patio.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.900
Really? Bobby, dry slower.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.818
Peggy, we can't watch this.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.361
Hank, we have to.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.197
When good people fail to watch,

19:58.280 --> 20:00.157
-bad things happen.
-What?

20:00.866 --> 20:03.744
Huh, I pegged her for a cryer,
not a screamer.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.537
Should I be seeing this?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.915
I feel like I'm growing up too fast.

20:07.998 --> 20:11.793
Dang it, don't stomp on the grass!
I just reseeded that section.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.961
Wait, she's...

20:13.045 --> 20:14.421
Whoa!

20:14.504 --> 20:15.839
I think she saw us. Duck!

20:19.384 --> 20:24.223
Our New Testament lesson is from the book
of Matthew. Let us hear the Word.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.310
"And seeing the multitudes..."

20:28.393 --> 20:30.896
So when's Reverend Stroup
going to give sermons again?

20:30.979 --> 20:32.981
That temp guy goes on too long.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.024
I don't know.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.693
I think she's gonna be
on probation for a while.

20:36.777 --> 20:40.072
You know, I can't help but think
that this is partly my fault.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.116
Uh, it's kind of all your fault, Bill.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.535
Yeah, I guess you're right.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.872
You know, Hank,
I think I finally figured out

20:48.956 --> 20:50.707
what God's plan is for me.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.125
Really? What's that?

20:52.209 --> 20:54.127
You know how you told me to fix my roof,

20:54.211 --> 20:56.838
and then you told me
not to secret date our minister,

20:56.922 --> 21:00.259
and then after I did that
I should break up with her like a man?

21:00.342 --> 21:01.176
Yeah?

21:01.260 --> 21:04.930
Well, I think God's plan for me
is to always listen to you.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.598
Well, I don't know about that,

21:06.682 --> 21:10.394
but it has been 3,000 miles
since your last oil change.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.104
Don't forget to take your car in.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.480
Thanks, Hank.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.983
<i>God told me to come here tonight!</i>
