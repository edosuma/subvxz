00:00.645 --> 00:01.889
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:01.890 --> 00:02.889
This is Frannie.

00:02.890 --> 00:03.889
Former student of mine.

00:03.890 --> 00:05.849
- She's homeless.
- And pregnant.

00:05.850 --> 00:07.440
And she's telling us
how she robs cars.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.439
You're gonna come home with me

00:14.440 --> 00:16.178
and you can stay there
until we figure this out.

00:16.180 --> 00:18.309
God, no, no,
you don't have to do that.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.639
I certainly am not gonna
put you out on the street

00:19.640 --> 00:20.979
to raise a baby.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.479
Oh, I'm-I'm not
keeping the baby.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.769
I'm giving it up.

00:23.770 --> 00:25.019
Oh.

00:25.020 --> 00:26.269
I want it to have a safe home

00:26.270 --> 00:28.559
and a chance at a good life.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.770
I'll take it.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.439
I'll take that baby.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.350
I made a promise to you two.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.939
If you want this baby

00:37.940 --> 00:41.639
half as much as I do, you are...

00:41.640 --> 00:45.269
never gonna forgive yourself
if you keep this promise.

00:45.270 --> 00:46.729
We're still going to adopt.

00:46.730 --> 00:48.099
There's a baby out there

00:48.100 --> 00:49.559
- with our name on it.
- Yeah.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.679
Before you know it, we'll be up
all hours of the night...

00:52.680 --> 00:54.100
...knee-deep in dirty diapers.

00:57.270 --> 00:59.309
The good thing about adoption

00:59.310 --> 01:01.599
is we can all be part
of the picking process.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.349
No we can't. Who said that?

01:04.349 --> 01:07.479
Hey, you always ask my opinion
when we go shoe shopping.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.019
How is this different?

01:09.020 --> 01:12.139
It's a human being.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.889
Exactly.

01:13.890 --> 01:15.487
Non-refundable.

01:17.350 --> 01:18.519
I say we get a Sagittarius baby.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.769
Anything but a Libra.

01:19.770 --> 01:21.769
They're very unreliable.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.229
Wait a minute, you're a Libra.

01:23.230 --> 01:24.939
I guess this is my way of saying

01:24.940 --> 01:26.940
I can't drive you
to the dentist tomorrow.

01:28.180 --> 01:30.679
Hey. None of you
have a say in this, all right?

01:30.680 --> 01:32.349
Molly and I want
another guy in the house.

01:32.350 --> 01:34.229
Preferably a left-handed pitcher

01:34.230 --> 01:36.769
who's got a little movement
on his splitter.

01:36.770 --> 01:39.309
I don't remember
having that conversation.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.980
You said "healthy baby"...
that's where my head went.

01:43.180 --> 01:44.729
This is the color
I was talking about.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.599
- Color for what?
- The baby.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.559
I was thinking we could go
with a nice caramel coffee.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.559
Aw, and he matches the drapes.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.139
Great, so I'll just tell
the people at the adoption agency

01:56.140 --> 01:57.809
that we're looking
for a left-handed,

01:57.810 --> 02:01.479
Sagittarius, baby boy that doesn't
clash with the curtains.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.019
Hey, wait a minute.

02:03.020 --> 02:05.770
A lot of great pitching's been
coming out of Latin America.

02:07.140 --> 02:08.940
That's him right there.

02:42.372 --> 02:43.701
I feel like an idiot.

02:43.702 --> 02:45.411
I'm the only guy here
with a tie.

02:45.412 --> 02:46.541
No, you look handsome

02:46.542 --> 02:48.871
and that tie may be just
the thing that gives us

02:48.872 --> 02:50.622
the baby edge over
all these other couples.

02:52.162 --> 02:54.291
Well, the tie ain't
gonna help if it's between us

02:54.292 --> 02:56.421
and Tom Brady and Gazelle
over there.

02:58.622 --> 03:01.371
Ah, look at him, huh?
Got the hands of a quarterback,

03:01.372 --> 03:03.162
and the teeth
of a game show host.

03:05.042 --> 03:07.462
I'm more worried about
these two suck ups over here,

03:09.486 --> 03:12.371
- Damn it, should we pray, too?
- It's...

03:12.372 --> 03:16.001
It's too late, they're
already working that shtick.

03:16.002 --> 03:18.411
Well, I think we should talk
game plan before we go in there.

03:18.412 --> 03:19.751
I say we play it calm.

03:19.752 --> 03:21.121
If we seem too eager,

03:21.122 --> 03:22.871
they're gonna try
to unload a lemon on us.

03:22.872 --> 03:27.411
Okay, you know we're trying to
get a baby, not a used Chevy.

03:27.412 --> 03:28.501
Yeah, I'm just saying.

03:28.502 --> 03:30.541
I mean, if they try
to give us a hard sell,

03:30.542 --> 03:31.831
we got to be prepared to walk.

03:31.832 --> 03:33.962
I bet we can
get a good one online.

03:35.502 --> 03:38.501
Okay, Mike, we need to forget
this and just be ourselves.

03:38.502 --> 03:41.291
And show these people
that we are good and honest

03:41.292 --> 03:44.541
and we're not into playing silly
games, we just want a baby.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.541
Molly Flynn and Mike Biggs?

03:46.542 --> 03:50.831
Oh, God... who...
art in heaven.

03:50.832 --> 03:52.792
Hallowed be thy name.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.161
Just give us a second,

03:57.162 --> 03:59.582
we're speaking
with our Lord.

04:08.502 --> 04:11.501
Did I mention I was
Teacher of the Year?

04:11.502 --> 04:13.542
You did.

04:15.502 --> 04:17.462
Brought home
the Golden Apple twice.

04:18.962 --> 04:22.201
I don't know if it matters,
but it's never been done before...

04:22.202 --> 04:24.122
or since.

04:25.462 --> 04:28.461
And, uh,
I am a decorated police officer.

04:28.462 --> 04:31.582
Most traffic tickets given
in the month of June.

04:33.252 --> 04:35.791
Sorry if you got caught up
in that, just doing my job.

04:41.372 --> 04:43.621
Well, thank you both
for coming in.

04:43.622 --> 04:45.791
Wait, the interview's over?

04:45.792 --> 04:46.791
It is.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.201
Oh, did-did I happen
to mention that

04:48.202 --> 04:49.371
I memorized <i>Good Night Moon?</i>

04:49.372 --> 04:50.791
"In the great, green room
there was a...

04:50.792 --> 04:52.411
there was a balloon, and, um..."

04:52.412 --> 04:54.831
There's a... I know
there's-there's bears

04:54.832 --> 04:56.541
and, there's, like, a bowl
of por... there's mush!

04:56.542 --> 04:57.541
I know there's mush.

04:57.542 --> 04:58.911
You don't need to do that.

04:58.912 --> 05:01.461
Listen, I may have been
playing this too cool.

05:01.462 --> 05:03.501
We really want to
make this happen.

05:03.502 --> 05:04.501
- Yeah.
- Get your manager.

05:04.502 --> 05:05.501
We're ready to leave here...

05:05.502 --> 05:06.791
with a baby today.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.701
Today.

05:08.702 --> 05:11.501
Don't worry.
You guys did very well.

05:11.502 --> 05:13.831
I think you're perfect
candidates for adoption.

05:13.832 --> 05:14.831
Oh, that's great.

05:14.832 --> 05:16.252
Thank you so much.

05:17.582 --> 05:21.292
So, the next thing for us to do
is schedule a home visit.

05:24.582 --> 05:26.251
Whose home?

05:26.252 --> 05:27.371
Your home.

05:27.372 --> 05:29.702
Y-you mean where we live?

05:31.042 --> 05:34.251
Yes, we just need to meet
all of your family members

05:34.252 --> 05:37.202
and make sure it's a healthy
environment for a child.

05:40.582 --> 05:42.962
Is there a day that works
better than the others?

05:45.042 --> 05:46.042
Nope.

05:53.483 --> 05:56.661
I'm telling you, something
ain't right back there.

05:56.662 --> 06:00.411
Are we looking at the pimple
or the spider bite?

06:00.412 --> 06:01.961
'Cause either way, we need
to call the dermatologist

06:01.962 --> 06:04.161
or the Orkin man.

06:04.162 --> 06:06.541
I'm looking at this raised mole.

06:06.542 --> 06:08.502
Looks like you
slept on a Milk Dud.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.371
Whatever it is, it's throbbing.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.581
Press them one at a time...
when I scream, you'll know.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.581
Hey.

06:15.582 --> 06:17.201
There they are.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.541
Where's my grand-baby?

06:18.542 --> 06:21.661
We were just cleaning up
my saddle for piggyback rides.

06:21.662 --> 06:25.371
Okay, well, we're not
quite there yet.

06:25.372 --> 06:26.001
However, she did say that

06:26.002 --> 06:28.541
Mike and I were excellent
candidates for an adoption.

06:28.542 --> 06:30.871
- Oh, that's wonderful! - Come on.
- Yay! I knew it! I knew it!

06:30.872 --> 06:32.871
Yeah, but, you know, we still
have a pretty big hurdle

06:32.872 --> 06:34.872
to get over, actually.

06:35.872 --> 06:37.041
Three of 'em.

06:39.002 --> 06:41.121
Yeah, what Mol is saying is

06:41.122 --> 06:43.541
that there are some other
aspects of the house

06:43.542 --> 06:46.109
that we have to
make more presentable.

06:47.082 --> 06:48.911
Are you talking about
the dust bunnies under my bed?

06:48.912 --> 06:51.292
More like the weed bunny
that sleeps on top of it.

06:52.752 --> 06:54.041
Um...

06:54.042 --> 06:56.961
Look, we...
we love you so much

06:56.962 --> 07:01.331
and we would never want
to change anything about you,

07:01.332 --> 07:02.961
except, on Saturday,

07:02.962 --> 07:05.837
when we need to change
everything about you.

07:07.462 --> 07:08.501
Not everything.

07:08.502 --> 07:10.201
Just the, uh...

07:10.202 --> 07:14.042
the drugs and the drinking
and the filthy language.

07:15.252 --> 07:17.042
That is everything.

07:17.832 --> 07:19.201
Well, then that's...

07:19.202 --> 07:21.978
what we're asking you to do.

07:24.412 --> 07:25.961
- Sure. - All right.
- Okay.

07:25.962 --> 07:27.961
Wait, really?

07:27.962 --> 07:30.946
It's a little insulting,
but it makes a lot of sense.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.622
We should start by
getting rid of all the booze.

07:40.122 --> 07:42.624
- To the baby. - To the baby!
- To the baby!

07:48.002 --> 07:49.411
I'm telling you,

07:49.412 --> 07:51.871
Molly's family has been taking
this like champs.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.081
They even let us do
a full sweep of their bedrooms.

07:55.082 --> 07:56.201
You find anything?

07:56.202 --> 07:57.662
We found everything.

07:59.372 --> 08:02.661
Pot, illegal prescription
pills, fireworks.

08:02.662 --> 08:04.980
It's like searching a car
coming back from Tijuana.

08:06.462 --> 08:08.121
Hey, uh, by the way,

08:08.122 --> 08:11.001
it'd be great if you could come
by the house on Saturday, too.

08:11.002 --> 08:14.614
Might help the adoption lady to
see how diverse my friends are.

08:16.082 --> 08:17.081
Diverse?

08:17.082 --> 08:18.621
Come on, you know what I mean?

08:18.622 --> 08:20.081
I certainly do.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.661
It's the "Oh, some of my best
friends are black" line.

08:22.662 --> 08:27.121
Yeah, but in my case,
that's actually true, see?

08:27.122 --> 08:29.201
So, if that somehow puts me
in a better light,

08:29.202 --> 08:31.961
that's on society, not me.

08:31.962 --> 08:33.410
And you want to exploit that.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.541
Yes, I do.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.722
For a baby.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.001
Man, how can I say no to that?

08:41.001 --> 08:43.160
You can't because
you're my best friend.

08:43.162 --> 08:45.081
<i>And</i> we're right back
where we started.

08:45.082 --> 08:46.371
Ah.

08:46.372 --> 08:49.081
Uh, what time did you say you
wanted me there on Saturday?

08:49.082 --> 08:50.411
Seriously?

08:50.412 --> 08:51.961
It's not what you think.

08:51.962 --> 08:53.831
I invited Samuel
because he's foreign.

08:53.832 --> 08:56.573
Gives me a little
international flavor.

08:57.292 --> 08:59.292
4:00.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.371
Isn't it a little premature
to be setting up the crib?

09:07.372 --> 09:09.961
Like lighting a bong
before you load the bowl.

09:09.962 --> 09:11.411
Okay. Now,

09:11.412 --> 09:13.831
I love your colorful analogies,

09:13.832 --> 09:15.291
but when
the adoption lady comes,

09:15.292 --> 09:17.831
let's keep those all in here,

09:17.832 --> 09:19.596
so they never come out here.

09:20.582 --> 09:21.831
Relax.

09:21.832 --> 09:24.121
I'll have her take a Xanax
before they get here.

09:24.122 --> 09:26.661
No, no pills, no booze, no weed.

09:26.662 --> 09:29.751
It's like a mother-daughter
detox. It'll be fun.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.621
Fine, but if I'm not drinking,

09:31.622 --> 09:34.791
I can't be held responsible
for my actions.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.041
Hey, trust me.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.081
The second that adoption lady
is out the door,

09:38.082 --> 09:40.871
I'll be elbow-deep in mojitos,
but until then,

09:40.872 --> 09:43.751
we've got to prove
that this house is safe,

09:43.752 --> 09:45.291
and secure, and baby ready.

09:45.292 --> 09:46.541
What are you talking about?

09:46.542 --> 09:48.621
This is the same house
you two grew up in

09:48.622 --> 09:50.041
and you both survived.

09:50.042 --> 09:51.041
Yeah, "survived,"

09:51.042 --> 09:53.581
which implies a chance of death.

09:53.582 --> 09:56.161
I admit, you girls
had some close calls.

09:56.162 --> 09:59.461
Remember the fort you
made out of that old fridge?

09:59.462 --> 10:01.751
Was that the day I blacked
out and met the fireman?

10:01.752 --> 10:04.161
One of 'em.

10:04.162 --> 10:05.961
Okay, no childhood stories.

10:05.962 --> 10:07.121
Actually, you know what?
Let's make it easy.

10:07.122 --> 10:08.411
No stories at all.

10:08.412 --> 10:11.001
It's starting to sound like you
don't want us to say anything.

10:11.002 --> 10:12.001
See?

10:12.002 --> 10:14.317
Victoria gets it.

10:15.792 --> 10:18.121
Now, come on, these adoption
people are trained

10:18.122 --> 10:20.541
to-to see hazards
that we're not even aware of.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.161
I mean, uncovered outlets
and sharp table corners,

10:23.162 --> 10:24.161
and, look.

10:24.162 --> 10:25.411
Look at these seashells.

10:25.412 --> 10:26.411
What do you see?

10:26.412 --> 10:29.124
A crappy Christmas gift
from Mom.

10:29.384 --> 10:32.161
Yes, but, to a baby?

10:32.162 --> 10:34.041
This is a fun thing
to put in your mouth.

10:37.252 --> 10:38.251
Mol!

10:42.912 --> 10:45.122
I think I made my point.

10:52.082 --> 10:53.690
Okay, Victoria, blouse.

10:54.412 --> 10:55.751
Carl, gum.

10:55.752 --> 10:58.001
Okay.

10:58.002 --> 10:59.661
Now, the adoption
lady's name is Karen.

10:59.662 --> 11:01.041
She is very nice.

11:01.042 --> 11:02.251
There are gonna be times where

11:02.252 --> 11:05.081
your instinct will be
to talk to her.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.371
Ignore those instincts.

11:07.372 --> 11:09.041
I think my neck size has changed

11:09.042 --> 11:10.961
since I bought this shirt
15 years ago.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.251
- Can you breathe?
- Yeah.

11:12.252 --> 11:14.001
You're fine.

11:14.002 --> 11:16.201
I told you to go
with the open shirt and scarf,

11:16.202 --> 11:18.121
like Jon Voight.

11:18.122 --> 11:19.291
Quit trying to
make me Jon Voight.

11:19.292 --> 11:21.122
I'll never be Jon Voight!

11:22.622 --> 11:24.461
Okay, here we go.

11:24.462 --> 11:26.081
Ooh. Don't mind if I do.

11:26.082 --> 11:28.041
I do, so don't.

11:28.042 --> 11:29.911
But I just wanted
a jicama stick.

11:29.912 --> 11:31.411
No don't,
they're stacked perfectly.

11:31.412 --> 11:33.411
- Relax, I'm good at Jenga.
- Hey!

11:33.412 --> 11:35.201
Hands off the jicama.

11:35.202 --> 11:37.041
Thank you.

11:37.042 --> 11:38.791
Okay, now before we get started,

11:38.792 --> 11:41.461
I-I just want you all
to know that I love you

11:41.462 --> 11:43.001
- Hmm.
- Very much,

11:43.002 --> 11:44.661
and if any one of you

11:44.662 --> 11:47.121
screws me out of getting
my hands on a baby...

11:47.122 --> 11:49.162
there we will be blood.

11:50.962 --> 11:52.751
Okay.

11:52.752 --> 11:54.752
Smiles everyone.
Let's have fun.

11:56.792 --> 11:57.871
Hello.

11:59.372 --> 12:00.581
You're late.

12:00.582 --> 12:02.041
For some reason,
you asked the only person

12:02.042 --> 12:03.961
coming on bicycle to bring ice.

12:03.962 --> 12:05.461
You only brought one bag?

12:05.462 --> 12:09.001
Just get in here and take a seat
with the rest of the ding-dongs.

12:12.792 --> 12:13.911
Hello!

12:13.912 --> 12:17.232
Look who it is.
What a pleasant surprise.

12:38.448 --> 12:39.448
Okay, Joyce.

12:41.908 --> 12:44.118
I noticed your home
has a nice-sized backyard.

12:48.658 --> 12:50.118
Thank you.

12:51.488 --> 12:54.527
I think what my mother is trying
to say is that it will be

12:54.528 --> 12:57.605
a wonderful place
for our child to play.

12:58.698 --> 13:01.158
Thank you.

13:03.368 --> 13:04.367
Jicama stick?

13:04.368 --> 13:06.277
Oh, no thank you.

13:06.278 --> 13:07.737
You sure? Maybe just one
so, you know,

13:07.738 --> 13:10.237
we can all get started.

13:10.238 --> 13:12.577
Carl, you know that no one
here needs permission

13:12.578 --> 13:14.157
to enjoy the hors d'oeuvres.

13:17.408 --> 13:19.487
Uh, Karen, I don't know
if you noticed,

13:19.488 --> 13:22.527
but the backyard
is safely fenced in.

13:22.528 --> 13:24.407
It was built with the help
of my two main men here:

13:24.408 --> 13:25.577
Carl and Samuel.

13:25.578 --> 13:28.487
Mm-hmm. Mike and I have
been partners for years.

13:28.488 --> 13:29.617
And we live together.

13:29.618 --> 13:31.578
- But not as a couple.
- Yeah.

13:32.908 --> 13:34.487
We're not gay, we're just here
'cause we're black.

13:34.488 --> 13:35.487
Oh, God.

13:41.448 --> 13:43.197
And I'm here
'cause I'm the sister.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.778
Which makes me the aunt.

13:45.988 --> 13:48.488
That's all I'm allowed to say.

13:50.488 --> 13:51.907
Okay,

13:51.908 --> 13:53.947
well, now that you've met
the whole gang,

13:53.948 --> 13:55.277
why don't I take you upstairs

13:55.278 --> 13:56.447
and show you where
the baby's gonna sleep.

13:56.448 --> 13:58.408
Sounds good.

14:02.368 --> 14:03.947
Excuse me.

14:03.948 --> 14:05.948
I think you dropped a $100 bill.

14:07.477 --> 14:09.527
No, I-I didn't.

14:09.528 --> 14:12.487
You sure? People lose track
of stuff all the time.

14:12.488 --> 14:15.778
$100 bills...
Third World babies.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.818
It's mine.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.408
Thank you for your honesty.

14:31.578 --> 14:35.407
Okay, uh, here is the crib
where the baby will sleep.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.367
It got five stars for safety

14:37.368 --> 14:39.117
and, I'll tell you what,
if there's a tornado,

14:39.118 --> 14:40.407
forget the basement,

14:40.408 --> 14:41.617
I'm riding out the storm
in this son of a gun.

14:43.198 --> 14:46.487
Well, I can see you've done
a lot of work and research.

14:46.488 --> 14:48.367
Oh, believe me, we are prepared.

14:48.368 --> 14:50.408
We're serious buyers.
We're not just looky-loos.

14:51.278 --> 14:52.527
Good to know.

14:52.528 --> 14:54.697
Now, can I see the room
the baby will stay in

14:54.698 --> 14:56.277
when it outgrows the crib?

14:56.278 --> 14:57.577
Oh.

14:57.578 --> 14:59.447
Oh, we really hadn't
thought about that yet.

14:59.448 --> 15:01.577
Um, is-is that an issue?

15:01.578 --> 15:04.488
Well, I only ask because...

15:11.578 --> 15:15.697
It seems like you already have
a pretty full house here.

15:15.698 --> 15:17.777
Five people living
in a three bedroom home.

15:17.778 --> 15:19.577
May I say something?

15:19.578 --> 15:21.407
No.

15:21.408 --> 15:24.577
I myself was raised in a two
bedroom, with three brothers,

15:24.578 --> 15:26.987
two sisters, my Grammy, Mom,
Dad, and Uncle Sal,

15:26.988 --> 15:28.948
who I later learned
was my real father.

15:30.868 --> 15:34.407
A small house actually
brought us closer together.

15:34.408 --> 15:37.407
Especially Mom and Uncle Sal.

15:37.408 --> 15:41.577
Isn't the plight of
the Italian immigrant fascinating?

15:41.578 --> 15:43.447
- Isn't it?
- What he's saying is

15:43.448 --> 15:45.447
kids don't need that much space.

15:45.448 --> 15:49.447
Molly slept in a drawer for two
years before we moved in here.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.657
One room. When my husband
and I wanted to have sex,

15:51.658 --> 15:53.908
we just closed the drawer.

15:55.368 --> 15:59.817
Aw, closed the drawer.

15:59.818 --> 16:02.237
I'm sorry.

16:02.238 --> 16:03.657
We just want to
make sure we're finding

16:03.658 --> 16:06.237
the best homes for our babies.

16:06.238 --> 16:07.237
Oh.

16:07.238 --> 16:08.527
Well, look no further,

16:08.528 --> 16:10.367
'cause this house is filled
with nothing but love.

16:10.368 --> 16:11.407
It's true and he should know,

16:11.408 --> 16:12.697
he used to be my lover.

16:12.698 --> 16:14.277
Oh, those were good times.

16:14.278 --> 16:15.487
The pleasure was worth the pain.

16:15.488 --> 16:16.407
I'd do it all over again.

16:16.408 --> 16:18.407
- Not here. Not now!
- Okay, okay, okay.

16:18.408 --> 16:19.618
Look, Karen, I...

16:21.658 --> 16:23.367
I realize that this
isn't the biggest house

16:23.368 --> 16:26.817
and maybe space will be
an issue down the road,

16:26.818 --> 16:28.577
but don't you think
it's more important that

16:28.578 --> 16:29.987
you have two people here

16:29.988 --> 16:32.617
that-that really,
truly love each other?

16:32.618 --> 16:35.197
Yeah, we are totally
committed to creating

16:35.198 --> 16:38.237
a healthy and safe environment
for this child.

16:38.238 --> 16:40.488
I promise you, we will
take good care of it.

16:47.818 --> 16:49.117
Wow.

16:49.118 --> 16:51.078
What horrible timing.

16:59.528 --> 17:01.408
Okay, well, she didn't say no.

17:02.448 --> 17:05.617
She didn't say anything,
she just ran out.

17:05.617 --> 17:07.867
Maybe she was in
a hurry to approve us.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.867
We guillotined a baby doll.

17:13.371 --> 17:17.156
The worst part is I can't even
blame my family for all this.

17:17.157 --> 17:19.367
I can.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.406
All right, maybe
they didn't exactly help,

17:21.407 --> 17:23.867
but we did this to ourselves.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.867
I mean, why couldn't I just
let Carl have some jicama?

17:28.198 --> 17:30.157
You were nervous,
and it just shows

17:30.158 --> 17:32.737
how important this
whole thing is to you.

17:32.738 --> 17:34.027
And you.

17:34.028 --> 17:36.907
It'll happen when it happens.

17:36.908 --> 17:38.577
Until that time comes,

17:38.578 --> 17:41.448
we'll... we'll just enjoy
our time together.

17:42.488 --> 17:44.157
To us.

17:44.158 --> 17:45.488
To us.

17:53.278 --> 17:55.158
I want a baby so damn bad.

17:56.738 --> 17:58.778
Me, too.

18:08.028 --> 18:11.317
God, look at all the jicama.

18:11.318 --> 18:12.948
I'm a monster.

18:14.408 --> 18:17.407
Jicama.
That's a weird word, jicama.

18:17.408 --> 18:19.488
Jicama!

18:20.438 --> 18:22.487
Are you drunk?

18:22.488 --> 18:23.487
Yes.

18:23.488 --> 18:25.407
I'm drunk-ama.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.197
Molly, is that you?

18:27.198 --> 18:28.407
Yeah.

18:28.408 --> 18:29.487
Come up to my room.

18:29.488 --> 18:31.317
You got to see what we did.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.487
Maybe they finally got
that thing off of Vince's back.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.367
I hope so, looks like
he's sleeping on a Milk Dud.

18:40.408 --> 18:42.407
Ta-da!

18:42.408 --> 18:44.697
Oh, my God, what did you do?

18:44.698 --> 18:46.448
Welcome to the nursery.

18:47.318 --> 18:48.777
Don't worry, I fixed the crib.

18:48.778 --> 18:51.277
It was missing a screw and you
put the rail in upside down,

18:51.278 --> 18:52.988
which created
an instrument of death.

18:54.368 --> 18:56.657
But other than that,
you did a great job.

18:56.658 --> 18:59.027
And I'm moving to the basement.

18:59.028 --> 19:01.487
I'm thinking circular couch,
lots of pillows.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.908
I want that whole
<i>I Dream of Jeannie</i> bottle vibe.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.527
This is the sweetest,
most amazing thing

19:08.528 --> 19:10.577
anybody has ever done for us.

19:10.578 --> 19:11.947
I mean... Oh!

19:11.948 --> 19:14.527
Mike, look, tiny socks.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.987
You know how I'm always saying

19:15.988 --> 19:18.947
I want to move the hell
out of this house?

19:18.948 --> 19:21.277
I don't want to go anywhere.

19:21.278 --> 19:22.618
I love you weirdos.

19:23.658 --> 19:24.867
Are you drunk?

19:24.868 --> 19:26.725
Yeah, it's really hitting me.

19:37.992 --> 19:40.791
I got to say, I appreciate
you being so thorough and open.

19:40.792 --> 19:43.371
Most couples hoping to adopt
aren't as forthcoming.

19:43.372 --> 19:45.241
Well, we're new to this agency

19:45.242 --> 19:47.411
and we just want you
to know who we are,

19:47.412 --> 19:49.161
warts and all.

19:49.162 --> 19:50.991
Yeah, that's right.
I mean, all we can do

19:50.992 --> 19:53.491
is be honest with our answers
and hope for the best.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.121
Well, you're doing great.

19:55.122 --> 19:57.331
So, about your living
situation...

19:57.332 --> 19:59.332
- We live alone.
- Just the two of us.
