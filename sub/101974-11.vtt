Yes. An Indo-Persian battle-ax,
four pistols and ammo.

11:38.757 --> 11:40.440
BARCLAY:
Do you think he was trying
to mess with you?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.425
You've got
a strange relationship, right?

11:42.518 --> 11:43.443
You visit him a lot?

11:43.595 --> 11:45.019
I would visit him
occasionally, yes.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.096
He never dropped a clue
about the escape

11:47.190 --> 11:48.281
or where he was going?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.858
No. And if he did,
I would have spotted it.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.603
Guys, this is exactly what
he wants-- the focus on me

11:53.696 --> 11:54.954
instead of him.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.439
But if you take
your eye off the ball

11:56.532 --> 11:57.290
for a split second

11:57.384 --> 11:59.033
with the Surgeon, you're dead!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.777
RUIZ:
All right, everyone,

12:00.795 --> 12:02.795
let's get to work.

12:02.948 --> 12:04.705
(indistinct chatter)

12:04.799 --> 12:07.100
(indistinct radio chatter)

12:11.898 --> 12:14.307
-Dani...
-Don't-don't...

12:14.401 --> 12:16.484
-don't even say it.
-I'm not fine.

12:18.630 --> 12:20.313
Surprised you with that one,
didn't I?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.282
And you shouldn't be fine.
This is insane.

12:23.226 --> 12:24.634
You know, it's funny.

12:24.652 --> 12:26.486
The one perk
about having a father in prison

12:26.638 --> 12:29.155
is knowing exactly where he is
at all times.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.308
You know, I could talk to him,
or I could ignore him.

12:32.327 --> 12:35.170
-At least...
-You were in control.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.591
They're right, you know.

12:39.742 --> 12:41.242
With those questions.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.410
How could I have not seen
this coming?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.079
What kind of a profiler am I?

12:45.173 --> 12:47.323
You're the son
of a seriously twisted guy.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.583
And right now
that's muddying everything else.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.010
But how do I do my job?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.678
How can I be this...

12:52.831 --> 12:56.483
big expert on The Surgeon
but be so clueless?

12:57.760 --> 13:02.005
Usually his voice is in my head
all the time.

13:02.098 --> 13:04.115
But now...

13:04.342 --> 13:05.766
-nothing.
-Look,

13:05.786 --> 13:08.602
we will find him through good
old-fashioned investigation.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.080
Stick with me,
we'll figure it out.

13:15.111 --> 13:17.278
The LeSabre was spotted
at an auto shop

13:17.297 --> 13:19.280
in the south of Westchester.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.466
Let's go.

13:24.787 --> 13:27.096
(footsteps approach)

13:33.146 --> 13:36.147
Sorry. Can I trouble you
for an aspirin

13:36.374 --> 13:37.557
(chuckles):
for my arm.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.559
Or a Vicodin, if you insist?

13:39.711 --> 13:41.210
Sure, yeah.

13:41.304 --> 13:43.880
Forgive my prying--
my children would say

13:43.898 --> 13:47.492
it's my most annoying quality,
or at least top three--

13:47.719 --> 13:49.643
but, um...

13:49.737 --> 13:51.329
do you need to talk?

13:51.480 --> 13:53.573
Your son told you what happened?

13:53.667 --> 13:58.244
I may have heard something
about your plight, and...

13:58.338 --> 14:02.632
it may be a plight with which
I am somewhat familiar.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.420
I feel like I'm in...

14:07.572 --> 14:09.472
hell's waiting room.

14:11.076 --> 14:14.168
Been there for 23 years.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.412
You get used to the heat.

14:16.505 --> 14:17.689
Really?

14:18.766 --> 14:20.525
You seem way too put together

14:20.752 --> 14:23.194
for someone who's been
through that kind of trauma.

14:23.346 --> 14:25.196
(chuckles softly):
No.

14:26.441 --> 14:29.275

14:29.369 --> 14:31.277

14:34.541 --> 14:36.023
waiting for the day

14:36.042 --> 14:40.086
when I get to see
Martin's open casket.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.939
And gin.

14:42.957 --> 14:45.633
That helps, too.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.472

15:06.764 --> 15:08.981
I'm guessing it's Hector,
but no one ever went inside.

15:09.134 --> 15:12.535
That doesn't make any sense.
Why park here, then?

15:13.821 --> 15:15.496

15:17.066 --> 15:20.567
-No way.
-Lots of food, cash business,

15:20.662 --> 15:21.902
no windows.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.588
Bowling?
The Surgeon would never allow

15:23.739 --> 15:25.072
-for that kind of distraction.
-No,

15:25.166 --> 15:26.591
but he's smart enough
to know if he doesn't let

15:26.742 --> 15:29.001

let off a little steam,

an official complaint.

23:28.633 --> 23:31.558
It turns out
just talking about it

23:31.652 --> 23:33.744
is enough to make me a...

23:33.971 --> 23:36.062
pariah, I guess.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.307
Bricks in my locker.

23:38.325 --> 23:39.642
Phone calls to my wife.

23:39.660 --> 23:42.161
That's terrifying.

23:42.313 --> 23:45.071
Have you told someone?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.674
Could Gil help?

23:47.835 --> 23:49.218
Nah.

23:50.078 --> 23:53.097
But why not try?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.809
Uh, I don't know.

23:58.179 --> 24:01.981
Why did you pretend
no one was on the phone earlier?

24:04.168 --> 24:05.985

I owe you an apology.

RUIZ:
Yes, you do.

24:12.176 --> 24:13.266
But it can wait.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.177
We found the phone
on Friar Pete.

24:15.196 --> 24:16.620
There's only one number
saved in it.

24:16.847 --> 24:17.621
We're running it down now.

24:17.848 --> 24:19.957
Well, let's call it.

<i> Dad, is that you?</i>

24:40.871 --> 24:42.480
Hello?

24:47.712 --> 24:49.970
Should we start
with why you were expecting

24:50.064 --> 24:51.572
The Surgeon's call?

24:53.067 --> 24:55.901
Or why you paid him
multiple secret visits

24:55.995 --> 24:57.328

24:58.072 --> 25:00.480
Claremont just confirmed it,

25:06.397 --> 25:08.580
You know the phrase
"make a federal case out of it"?

25:08.733 --> 25:11.734
That's what the marshals
want to do to you.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.902
It's a courtesy I'm here first.

25:13.996 --> 25:15.346
Tell me.

25:15.497 --> 25:18.682
Why were you waiting

25:22.021 --> 25:23.762

I don't know. It's dumb.

25:23.914 --> 25:25.005
But it's not a crime.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.915
Malcolm talks to him
all the time,

25:26.934 --> 25:28.267
and no one ever suspects him.

25:28.419 --> 25:29.693
People always suspect him.

25:29.845 --> 25:30.919
Ouch.

25:30.938 --> 25:32.679

Martin had been planning

25:32.773 --> 25:34.089
this escape for a while.

25:34.108 --> 25:36.258
He never mentioned it
or asked you to help him?

25:36.351 --> 25:39.203
Are you suggesting I aided
and abetted a known criminal?

25:39.354 --> 25:40.854
I'm suggesting
that you could have

25:40.873 --> 25:42.689
aided and abetted your father,

25:42.708 --> 25:43.874
a distinction I think

25:44.101 --> 25:45.434
you and your brother
have a habit of making.

25:45.452 --> 25:47.378
We didn't plan a prison break,

25:47.529 --> 25:48.453
I promise.

25:48.606 --> 25:49.529
Our conversations

25:49.549 --> 25:50.363
were completely innocent,

25:50.457 --> 25:52.032
and I didn't even initiate them.

25:52.051 --> 25:56.011
I was just sitting at home,
working.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.060

26:25.643 --> 26:28.586
Thought you might appreciate
a sympathetic ear.

26:28.813 --> 26:30.495
<i> Am I wrong?</i>

26:30.648 --> 26:32.256

26:32.407 --> 26:35.000
It's hard being misunderstood.

26:35.152 --> 26:37.911
Everyone knows
exactly who you are.

26:38.005 --> 26:41.181
Okay.
So it's hard being understood.

26:43.919 --> 26:45.919
What exactly did you talk about?

26:46.013 --> 26:48.254
Life stuff.

26:48.349 --> 26:51.091
He could be
surprisingly insightful.

26:51.185 --> 26:52.592
She's hiding something.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.069
You think?

26:57.024 --> 26:58.282
Let's take ten.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.872
What's going on?
What did she say?

27:14.024 --> 27:15.691
Nothing helpful.

27:15.784 --> 27:16.967
-(sighs)
-The only thing

27:17.194 --> 27:19.044
that's clear
is how desperate she is

27:19.138 --> 27:21.013
for a father in her life.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.551
Maybe I should have done more
for her when she was growing up.

27:26.704 --> 27:30.539
You were with Malcolm
every step of the way,

27:30.632 --> 27:32.691
and he is still
under Martin's spell.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.063
No matter what we did,

27:38.157 --> 27:40.991
all roads led to Martin.

27:41.810 --> 27:43.309
So maybe we stand back

27:43.329 --> 27:44.995
and see if they lead to him now.

27:48.742 --> 27:51.001
Do you have a secret plan?

27:51.153 --> 27:52.503

27:52.654 --> 27:55.321
Bright couldn't interrogate
his own sister.

But they didn't say
I couldn't take a break,

28:23.944 --> 28:26.203
And I need you
to tell me the truth.

28:31.435 --> 28:32.951
I've been listening
to his warped BS

28:33.103 --> 28:34.694
for 20 years, remember?

28:34.788 --> 28:37.122
You know how many times
he's tried to convince me

28:37.274 --> 28:39.107
I'm just like him?

28:39.201 --> 28:40.718
It's not a compliment.

28:40.945 --> 28:43.278
It's just another form of abuse.

28:43.297 --> 28:46.056
What if he's not wrong?

28:47.209 --> 28:48.967
MARTIN:
Now that we know that you have,

28:49.119 --> 28:52.137

psychopathic tendencies...

28:52.231 --> 28:53.972
-What are you talking about?
-Oh,

28:54.124 --> 28:56.291

that you're a killer.

28:56.310 --> 28:58.384

Although,

28:58.404 --> 29:00.312
killing someone
does kind of tip the scales.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.481
-Do you have a point?
-You're driven.

29:02.633 --> 29:04.299
Ambitious.

29:04.392 --> 29:05.576
Maybe, uh,

29:05.727 --> 29:07.911
