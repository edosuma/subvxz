00:18.418 --> 00:20.420
You always take me
to the nicest places.

00:20.455 --> 00:21.987
Weli...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.588
it wasn't my choice.

00:23.623 --> 00:25.225
How well do you know
this conlan anyway?

00:25.625 --> 00:29.028
I guess as
well as you can know
anyone you work with.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.432
Now, by work are you talking
about your past endeavours

00:32.467 --> 00:34.451
as a lowlife and a hoodlum?

00:34.486 --> 00:36.436
Hey, that's not very nice.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.838
Oh yeah, justified,
but still not nice.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.442
Hey, i am just going
by what you've told me.

00:42.477 --> 00:46.011
Yeah,
you know, matty and i...

00:46.046 --> 00:48.848
collaborated on a few projects
together here and there.

00:48.883 --> 00:52.052
And you never noticed
any signs of new mutancy?

00:52.452 --> 00:54.054
No, no.

00:54.454 --> 00:58.058
It's like, party tricks,
slight of hand stuff, you know?

00:58.093 --> 01:00.060
If there was any
kind of power involved,

01:00.095 --> 01:02.027
it wasn't anything major.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.265
Then i wonder what raised
the gsa's sudden interest.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.466
Hey, matty.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.068
Hello?

01:16.876 --> 01:17.877
Hah-hah.

01:17.912 --> 01:18.996
Come here.

01:19.031 --> 01:20.080
What's up?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.689
Yeah, you're
looking beter than ever.

01:29.724 --> 01:31.256
Yeah.

01:31.291 --> 01:32.892
Yeah, you're not
looking so bad yourself.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.094
I was afraid
you wouldn't show up.

01:34.494 --> 01:35.695
Oh, come on, i wouldn't
have missed it.

01:35.730 --> 01:36.496
Matty, emma.

01:36.896 --> 01:37.697
Emma, matty.

01:37.732 --> 01:38.863
Hey.

01:38.898 --> 01:39.699
Brennan, you never...

01:40.100 --> 01:40.900
so how you been?

01:40.935 --> 01:42.719
Me? Yeah.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.430
Good. Good.

01:44.465 --> 01:46.071
But you...

01:46.106 --> 01:49.309
well, my friend, i'm afraid
you ain't doing so hot.

01:54.914 --> 01:56.916
Emma, get behind me.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.719
Matty, what's going on?

01:59.754 --> 02:01.321
Sorry, bren', i had to.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.140
Brennan.

02:57.777 --> 02:58.978
Emma?

02:59.013 --> 03:00.180
Emma?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.403
Damn, my head is killing me.

03:27.807 --> 03:28.973
No brennan.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.610
His girlfriend will have to do.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.212
Grab her and let's go.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.899
I feel so hot.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.100
Yeah.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.102
Hey, don't try to get up.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.522
You feel okay?

05:05.557 --> 05:07.872
I think so.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.275
I'm not
surprised if you don't.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.112
Preliminary tests show that
your molecular structure's

05:13.147 --> 05:15.515
been somehow
altered by the attack.

05:15.550 --> 05:16.281
How?

05:16.316 --> 05:19.484
I don't know.

05:19.519 --> 05:21.921
We'll know
more after i can analyze
the results of the edd scan.

05:21.956 --> 05:23.523
Okay.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.705
What's wrong?

05:40.740 --> 05:42.742
This thing is safe, right?

05:43.142 --> 05:44.744
Of course.

05:55.154 --> 05:56.356
Look, you got conned.

05:56.756 --> 05:57.757
It's no big deal.

05:57.792 --> 05:58.723
And emma's fine.

05:58.758 --> 06:00.159
Yeah, no thanks to me.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.526
I walked right into it.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.727
So what are
you going to do,

06:02.762 --> 06:03.563
keep beating
yourself up over it?

06:03.963 --> 06:05.164
Yeah, i tell you who
i'd like to beat up.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.331
You'd hit a woman?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.567
No, no, but if there was
a woman who could drive me

06:07.967 --> 06:09.133
to do it it would be her.

06:09.168 --> 06:10.370
Hey, you let your
guard down, that's all.

06:10.405 --> 06:11.936
It just doesn't make sense.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.973
The matty conlan i
knew was totally stand-up.

06:14.008 --> 06:15.540
Stand-up, liar, cheat or thief?

06:15.575 --> 06:17.777
Yeah, where did this
energy thing come from?

06:17.812 --> 06:19.979
You never saw her
use her powers before?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.747
She didn't have
those powers before.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.383
Well, wait, it's hard to
believe that they could have

06:24.418 --> 06:25.985
evolved like that in
such a short period of time.

06:26.020 --> 06:27.552
Yeah.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.989
Trust me, we've been
in some pretty tight
situations together.

06:30.024 --> 06:31.155
I'll bet.

06:31.190 --> 06:32.392
Yeah, not that kind of tight.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.359
Now, if she had
had those abilities,

06:34.394 --> 06:35.995
then she would have had plenty
of opportunities to use them.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.562
You're certain of that?

06:37.597 --> 06:39.999
You know, i don't even know
what i'm certain of anymore.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.605
The force
of your power's magnitude
should have killed her.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.171
Would you rather she was dead?

06:47.206 --> 06:50.009
Having her as a prisoner
gives us more options.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.580
What stopped you
from delivering mulwray?

06:55.615 --> 06:59.218
I promised
you a member from mutant
x and that's what you got.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.822
My concern
over the toll it took on
you remains, miss conlan.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.824
It's just a headache.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.426
It'll go away.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.228
Talk to dr. Harrison about
these side effects when he sees

07:09.263 --> 07:10.830
you for your fine-tuning.

07:11.230 --> 07:11.996
No.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.598
No more operations.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.234
If it wasn't for
these operations,

07:15.269 --> 07:17.053
you'd still be
a small time hustler.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.838
A job here remains
open, miss conlan.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.405
When i agreed to do this,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.041
i didn't realize everything
that was involved.

07:22.076 --> 07:23.643
You're still
interested, aren't you?

07:23.678 --> 07:24.809
And if i say no?

07:24.844 --> 07:27.246
I certainly
would never force anyone
to better themselves.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.049
Are you still
interested, miss conlan?

07:30.084 --> 07:31.651
Yeah.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.018
I'm still interested.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.055
Then you have
to maintain your health.

07:36.090 --> 07:37.622
I'm fine.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.659
If you're
to assume a position
of authority in this

07:39.694 --> 07:42.026
organization, we have
to be certain of that.

07:42.061 --> 07:44.464
I just need a
little time to recuperate
before my next operation.

07:44.499 --> 07:46.431
Of course,
take some time off.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.868
We can wait
to meet with dr. Harrison
until this afternoon.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.470
Three o'clock?

07:50.870 --> 07:53.237
Fine.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.274
See you at three.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.705
Yo, man.

08:25.740 --> 08:26.906
Hey, hey.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.514
Hey, baby, mm.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.295
No way.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.332
Well, if it
isn't the man himself.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.334
How's it going, max?

08:55.735 --> 08:56.901
Not bad, not bad.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.938
I heard some crazy
rumours about you, man.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.505
Yeah?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.542
Well,
you know, people
are always talking.

09:02.577 --> 09:04.361
What brings you to
this part of town?

09:04.396 --> 09:06.071
Well i'm looking
for matty conlan.

09:06.106 --> 09:07.747
Happen to
know where she's at?

09:07.782 --> 09:08.548
It's been months.

09:08.948 --> 09:09.749
What's she up to?

09:10.149 --> 09:11.315
I was kind of
hoping you'd tell me.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.552
I mean, this is kind
of her office, right?

09:12.952 --> 09:13.753
She practically
lived here.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.354
Yeah,
then one day she just
stopped coming in.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.556
Been weeks now.

09:16.591 --> 09:18.122
Weeks?

09:18.157 --> 09:21.360
Well, that's funny,
because a few seconds
ago you said months.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.779
Yeah, weeks,
months, who cares?

09:22.814 --> 09:24.163
It's been a long time, okay?

09:25.364 --> 09:26.966
You know, i'm guessing that
you know where she's at.

09:27.001 --> 09:27.767
What are you saying,
i'm lying to you?

09:28.167 --> 09:29.333
Yeah.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.970
Yeah,
you're always lying.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.372
Let me
tell you something, man,
i can make one phone call

09:33.407 --> 09:34.974
and you'll quickly learn
just what pain really means,

09:35.374 --> 09:36.576
you understand me?

09:36.611 --> 09:37.376
Yeah?

09:37.777 --> 09:39.378
You know what, i can
make one phone call too.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.945
You know mr sunny marco?

09:40.980 --> 09:42.982
Yeah, i can
talk to him about all
the gambling kick backs

09:43.017 --> 09:44.984
that you've
been skimming.

09:53.392 --> 09:54.959
All right, man,
just be cool.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.596
I'll be straight
with you, all right?

09:56.631 --> 09:58.162
All right.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.164
Tell me what
i need to know.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.801
A few weeks
back she got popped for
pinching stolen goods.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.404
And then the cop who busted her
was on somebody else's payroll.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.371
Some government
guy or something.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.408
Now, the word is
she cut some kind of deal.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.375
Where's she staying?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.412
Remember ross,
her ex-boyfriend
up on mason street?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.579
Yeah, second floor.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.616
She might be staying
at his place.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.418
Thank you.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.241
Get near
me with that,

10:42.642 --> 10:44.644
doctor, you've breathed
your last breath.

10:45.044 --> 10:49.849
The man you are holding
is dr. Kenneth harrison,

10:49.884 --> 10:52.652
the gsa's most
illustrious biogeneticist.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.820
Is it always
so damn cold in here?

10:55.855 --> 10:58.658
Well, actually the temperature
of the lab has been lowered

10:58.693 --> 11:01.460
to inhibit the spread
of disease and viruses.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.462
Germs freak you out, huh?

11:03.863 --> 11:08.668
I'm afraid dr. Harrison
must complete his examination.

11:08.703 --> 11:11.070
I'm not going to
be your latest guinea pig.

11:21.881 --> 11:25.484
Well, this is a side of emma
delauro my intelligence on

11:25.519 --> 11:27.852
mutant x told me nothing about.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.690
Well, i'm nothing like the
rest of those mutant x freaks.

11:30.725 --> 11:32.692
You call your
own teammates freaks?

11:33.092 --> 11:34.894
You consider
yourself normal?

11:34.929 --> 11:36.696
I consider
myself gifted.

11:37.096 --> 11:40.700
Too valuable to be wasted
as some doctor's lab rat.

11:44.303 --> 11:47.907
I know it's a ploy,
but i'm intrigued.

11:47.942 --> 11:50.675
What did you have in mind?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.712
Why not try
a real experiment?

11:52.747 --> 11:56.132
And let me join you.

11:56.167 --> 11:59.518
I beg your pardon?

11:59.919 --> 12:01.485
You heard me.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.724
I want to leave mutant x
and come work with the gsa.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.264
Hey, would you
two please be careful?

12:45.664 --> 12:48.032
Careful?

12:48.067 --> 12:50.069
You almost fell back there.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.839
No, i didn't.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.440
He looked fine to me.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.042
Well,
looks can be deceiving.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.678
This is dangerous
business, you guys.

13:00.079 --> 13:01.645
Someone could get really hurt.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.282
Well, that's
why we practice, emma.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.085
So when we get into a
real fight with the bad guys,

13:06.120 --> 13:07.651
we don't get hurt.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.489
You know, sometimes i wish we
didn't have to fight the gsa.

13:10.890 --> 13:14.093
There should be a better way
for us to deal with them.

13:14.128 --> 13:15.294
Yeah, absolutely.

13:15.694 --> 13:18.062
But, um, there's not.

13:18.097 --> 13:23.302
Which is why i suggest we
start taking more precautions.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.704
Precautions?

13:26.105 --> 13:27.671
Yeah.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.673
I mean, look at
our daily routine.

13:29.708 --> 13:36.115
Fighting, flipping,
offense, defense,
throwing around our,

13:36.150 --> 13:40.920
let's face it, potentially
dangerous powers.

13:40.955 --> 13:42.922
But that's what we do.

13:42.957 --> 13:44.488
Yeah, i know.

13:44.523 --> 13:47.726
And i
understand that, i do, but
if adam expects us to train

13:47.761 --> 13:54.934
like this, we have to
think more about our safety.

13:54.969 --> 13:57.301
Are you for real?

13:57.336 --> 14:01.740
All i'm saying is:
Let's be safe out there.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.143
And in here.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.153
Post-traumatic
stress disorder.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.159
I have to say, miss delauro,
this is quite unexpected.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.927
And quite unbelievable.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.364
Why do you want
to leave mutant x?

14:25.764 --> 14:29.368
I'm sick of
their mealy-mouthed,
non-lethal style.

14:29.403 --> 14:32.171
I'm ready for
some real action.

14:32.571 --> 14:36.140
I thought i'd do well here.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.978
Not if you think
you can manipulate me.

14:39.013 --> 14:41.380
What is
it you want here?

14:41.415 --> 14:43.347
Job satisfaction.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.385
Adam doesn't recognize
my true potential.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.305
I tried to get you
to join us once before.

14:49.340 --> 14:52.191
No, you tried to
make me your prisoner.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.794
This is the
first time you've listened
to what i've had to say.

14:55.829 --> 14:58.197
You've never wanted
to talk to me before.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.000
Perhaps that hit from
miss conlan affected your brain.

15:01.035 --> 15:03.002
What if it did?

15:03.402 --> 15:05.804
Maybe that's what it took
to bring out the real me.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.572
The real you would
betray your mutant friends?

15:08.607 --> 15:11.810
They're a misfit
gang of do-gooders that
i'm forced to live with.

15:11.845 --> 15:15.414
This is all very entertaining,
but why should i trust you?

15:15.814 --> 15:17.781
You shouldn't.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.619
I'll have to
prove myself to you.

15:20.654 --> 15:22.621
Dr. Harrison's here.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.824
Send him in.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.034
Conlan missed
her appointment.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.801
We can't
find her anywhere.

15:37.836 --> 15:41.040
Perhaps it's time
to cut our losses and move
onto new test subjects.

15:41.075 --> 15:43.442
But i still need to get
a final read on her condition.

15:43.842 --> 15:47.846
Otherwise, all the
data we've collected thus
far could be corrupted.

15:47.881 --> 15:49.813
Let me find her.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.850
When i was with her i picked
up on where she might go.

15:51.885 --> 15:53.452
And where is that?

15:53.852 --> 15:55.419
It's a feeling.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.655
I'll know it when i get there.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.622
She is lying.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.860
It's an opportunity for me
to show you what i can do.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.466
You're not taking
this seriously?

16:07.866 --> 16:11.070
You'll be accompanied
by gs agents.

16:11.105 --> 16:12.636
Fine.

16:12.671 --> 16:15.073
Just as long as
they stay out of my way.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.441
I expect to hear from
you every two hours.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.279
I'll be back
before you have time
to check your watch.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.699
Emma?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.902
You still trying to
shake off the attack?

16:43.937 --> 16:45.721
I'm okay.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.471
All right.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.908
Is there anything
else you can tell
me about what happened?

16:50.309 --> 16:52.311
I've told you everything
i can remember.

16:52.346 --> 16:54.313
Anything different
happening to you...

16:54.348 --> 16:56.332
tele-empathically?

16:56.367 --> 16:58.343
What do you mean?

16:58.378 --> 17:00.319
Well, any discomfort?

17:00.719 --> 17:03.087
Any changes in the
way you sense things?

17:03.122 --> 17:06.290
Any unusual images that
you might be picking up?

17:06.325 --> 17:09.928
Other than feeling a little
shook up, everything feels

17:09.963 --> 17:12.296
pretty normal.

17:12.330 --> 17:15.134
Okay, so you'll
tell me if there's any
pain, any dizziness, any...

17:15.169 --> 17:16.700
of course.

17:16.734 --> 17:17.536
All right,
i'll be in the lab.

17:17.935 --> 17:18.702
Okay.

17:18.737 --> 17:19.738
You promise?

17:19.772 --> 17:20.739
I promise.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.340
Okay.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.160
Where's conlan?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.562
Huh?

17:43.962 --> 17:45.564
What, you think you
can send me on a fool's
run and get away with it?

17:45.964 --> 17:47.165
Conlan would
have killed me, man.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.367
Yeah, well i'm not
going to kill you,

17:48.767 --> 17:49.968
but i'll damn
sure make you hurt.

17:50.003 --> 17:50.769
Where's she at?

17:51.170 --> 17:52.336
Huh?

17:52.371 --> 17:54.338
She's in the back.

17:54.373 --> 17:56.375
She better
be in the back.

18:09.188 --> 18:11.190
You know, i never would have
figured you for a rat, matty.

18:11.225 --> 18:12.791
What did eckhart offer
you to sell me out, huh?

18:13.192 --> 18:14.758
My life.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.161
I'd have chosen prison,
but it wasn't an option.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.399
Before eckhart made me his
test monkey, the most i could do

18:20.799 --> 18:22.801
was make a quarter
slide across a table.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.803
So what are you saying,
the gsa experimented on you

18:24.838 --> 18:26.805
to amp up your power?

18:33.212 --> 18:34.813
Emma,
what are you doing here?

18:42.020 --> 18:43.187
No.

18:43.222 --> 18:44.823
Brennan!

19:02.841 --> 19:04.843
Brennan!

19:22.528 --> 19:23.694
This is crazy.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.731
The emma with the
gsa must be an imposter.

19:25.766 --> 19:27.297
Well, i wouldn't
put it past eckhart.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.735
Finding mutant x lookalikes
to screw with our heads.

19:29.770 --> 19:31.354
No, it was emma.

19:31.389 --> 19:32.903
Both of them.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.540
Yeah, except that one of
them is working with the gsa.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.942
And neither one of them
was the emma that we know.

19:36.977 --> 19:38.909
Could she have
been cloned or something?

19:38.944 --> 19:41.346
I think it happened when you and
emma were attacked by conlan.

19:41.381 --> 19:45.768
By supercharging
the electromagnetic
charge of conlan's,

19:45.803 --> 19:50.155
i think that you unwittingly
created a power that was capable

19:50.190 --> 19:53.759
of cutting through cellular
material to a genetic level.

19:54.159 --> 19:56.361
I did?

19:56.396 --> 19:58.529
So...

19:58.564 --> 20:00.966
emma's walking around with
only half her chromosones?

20:01.001 --> 20:03.586
No, no, no, it's more like
the double helix pattern was

20:03.621 --> 20:06.171
cleaved into a mirrored bay
sequence and then reformed to

20:06.206 --> 20:09.740
make two separate entities.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.978
And if we can't figure out a
way of re-integrating the two

20:13.013 --> 20:15.380
emmas back into
one complete person...

20:15.415 --> 20:18.400
it could be fatal.

20:18.435 --> 20:21.386
To both of them.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.592
It's not true.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.594
Not a word.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.195
Emma.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.162
I am the real emma.

20:32.197 --> 20:35.400
That other person
is just some fake.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.608
I can hardly wait until
adam hears about this.

20:42.643 --> 20:44.174
He already has.

20:44.209 --> 20:47.012
In the
midst of picking up conlan,
we ran into brennan mulwray.

20:47.047 --> 20:50.981
So adam's heard all about
your change of heart by now.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.819
It would have been
so much easier for you to
just keep our appointment.

20:53.854 --> 20:55.821
It would have been so
much easier if you'd have just

20:55.856 --> 20:57.022
killed me when we met.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.024
I saved you from a wasted
life and turned your piddling

20:59.059 --> 21:01.426
mutant powers into
something truly formidable.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.445
All you gave me is pain.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.430
Which will soon be over.

21:10.636 --> 21:13.038
After dr. Harrison has
completed the final examination.

21:13.073 --> 21:16.241
Have miss conlan
prepared for stasis.

21:16.642 --> 21:17.843
Yes, sir.

21:28.253 --> 21:30.255
Hey, emma.

21:30.290 --> 21:33.058
Emma?

21:33.458 --> 21:35.025
Hello?

21:35.060 --> 21:37.027
Who's this?

21:37.062 --> 21:39.464
I think we both
know who this is.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.431
I know who i am.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.468
You are nothing
but a freak accident.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.271
Now,
is that any way to talk
to your better half?

21:46.306 --> 21:48.674
If you think joining
the gsa makes you better.

21:48.709 --> 21:50.641
When did you get so tough?

21:50.676 --> 21:53.078
Last time i
saw you, you looked like
a little girl who was

21:53.113 --> 21:55.297
ready to cry.

21:55.332 --> 21:57.447
What do you want?

21:57.482 --> 21:59.850
Tell adam his methods
don't cut it anymore.

21:59.885 --> 22:04.689
So i'm going to
put an end to eckhart and
the gsa once and for all.

22:04.724 --> 22:09.494
You know, it's so
simple i'm disgusted adam
didn't think of it sooner.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.862
What are
you going to do?

22:11.897 --> 22:13.899
What they've
been doing to us.

22:14.299 --> 22:17.467
Turn genomex into
one giant stasis pod.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.305
Only this time,
their metabolisms
will be lowered to the

22:20.340 --> 22:22.708
point that no
one will ever wake up.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.510
But you'll kill
all of the new mutants
that eckhart's holding.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.913
Just tell adam i want to
meet him and i want to know

22:27.948 --> 22:30.716
who's side he's on.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.919
So the good news
is she was only pretending
to go over to the gsa.

22:34.319 --> 22:37.522
Yeah,
well the bad news is she is
out of her freaking mind.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.941
I don't know.

22:38.976 --> 22:40.290
Don't say that.

22:40.325 --> 22:42.728
Look, look, see she's the...

22:42.763 --> 22:44.294
she's the rash side.

22:44.329 --> 22:45.931
She's the unrestrained side
of you that you normally keep in

22:45.966 --> 22:47.898
check by your better instincts.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.335
Yeah,
but doesn't she care about
all of the innocent people

22:50.370 --> 22:52.337
who will be killed if
she goes through with this?

22:52.738 --> 22:53.904
No, i don't think so.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.341
I think he's just
focused on destroying
eckhart and the gsa.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.343
Well,
she is nothing like me.

22:58.744 --> 23:01.747
Well, evidentally, one of the
by-products of this genetic

23:01.782 --> 23:04.750
split is this
division of personality
characteristics where

23:04.785 --> 23:07.953
she becomes more
impulse-driven and you're,

23:07.988 --> 23:09.955
you know, more cautious.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.357
Well, it is a
dangerous world, adam.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.924
Cautious is
the only way to be.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.361
Emma, we all have to
take risks sometimes, right?

23:16.396 --> 23:17.963
Taking out genomex
is more than a risk.

23:17.998 --> 23:19.564
It would be a disaster.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.731
Exactly.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.367
So we have
to talk her out of it.

23:22.402 --> 23:23.168
I tried that.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.735
She won't listen.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.371
But she'll
meet with me, right?

23:26.406 --> 23:27.973
You and you alone.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.178
She wants mutant x
to join her in her plan.

23:37.182 --> 23:39.184
All right, bourbon neat.

23:39.219 --> 23:40.385
Thanks.

23:40.786 --> 23:43.989
That'll be...

23:44.024 --> 23:46.409
on the house.

23:46.444 --> 23:48.794
You're a doll.

23:48.829 --> 23:50.395
Yeah.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.571
I didn't
know you drank.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.608
If you're looking for
the teatotaller version,

24:03.643 --> 24:05.575
i believe
she's with you.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.612
Look,
i want you to come back
to the sanctuary with me.

24:08.013 --> 24:10.781
Why, so i can see my weak
side in whimpering action?

24:10.816 --> 24:13.218
No, because
i think i found a way to
get you back to yourself.

24:13.253 --> 24:14.785
Your whole, true self.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.822
And i thought you came here
to join me on my crusade.

24:16.857 --> 24:18.423
No, i'm going
to stop your crusade.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.042
Please.

24:20.077 --> 24:21.591
Weli...

24:21.626 --> 24:23.193
you want to
kill innocent people?

24:23.228 --> 24:26.431
Mason eckhart and his cronies
are anything but innocent.

24:26.466 --> 24:29.234
There are dozens of
new mutants in stasis.

24:29.269 --> 24:30.801
You want
to kill them too?

24:30.836 --> 24:32.437
It's a
small price to pay for the
hundreds who will be saved

24:32.472 --> 24:34.004
if we stop eckhart now.

24:34.039 --> 24:35.640
See, you're thinking with
only one side of your brain.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.207
You're not thinking clearly.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.209
No, i have never
been more lucid.

24:39.244 --> 24:42.848
Don't you see what a golden
opportunity this is for us?

24:42.883 --> 24:45.067
I am inside genomex.

24:45.102 --> 24:47.217
Eckhart trusts me.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.854
All right, look,
look, listen to me.

24:49.254 --> 24:52.457
My tests show that, in this
form as two separate identities,

24:52.492 --> 24:54.459
you both could be
dead in a couple of hours.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.660
I feel fine.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.662
I've got lab
tests to prove it.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.481
You tested her, not me.

24:59.516 --> 25:01.231
You're both the same.

25:01.266 --> 25:03.668
Now, i need you
to come back so that i can
reintegrate you with her.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.235
I'll think about it.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.072
After i take
care of genomex.

25:07.107 --> 25:08.874
I cannot
let you do that.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.280
Emma.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.282
Emma!

25:18.884 --> 25:20.886
Emma!

25:31.296 --> 25:33.663
So how's
this going to work?

25:33.698 --> 25:36.501
Each of these will
intensify the wavelength
from the scanner.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.103
And then broaden...

25:39.304 --> 25:41.706
i mean, how is
this going to work to get
emma back together again?

25:41.741 --> 25:42.908
We have to move fast.

25:43.308 --> 25:44.509
Emma and
conlan are at genomex.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.312
So you and jesse take the
double helix, get over there and

25:47.347 --> 25:48.914
get emma out before
she can do any damage.

25:49.314 --> 25:50.115
Okay, but you...

25:50.515 --> 25:51.716
you already tried that.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.883
It's not that easy.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.920
Well, i expect you
to succeed where i failed.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.521
Woah, shal-.

25:56.922 --> 25:58.123
See if you can get matty
out of there too, alright?

25:58.523 --> 25:59.724
Okay.

25:59.759 --> 26:00.926
Thanks.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.323
What are you doing?

26:33.358 --> 26:34.759
Saving you from
the big sleep,

26:34.794 --> 26:36.161
what does it look
like i'm doing?

26:36.561 --> 26:37.327
I need the help.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.563
Why should i help you?

26:38.964 --> 26:40.530
Well, it's not like you've
got a lot of options.

26:40.565 --> 26:42.968
Besides, i think
you're going to love
what i have in mind.

26:43.003 --> 26:44.569
Come on.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.739
In a hurry,
miss delauro?

26:49.774 --> 26:51.376
I demand to know
what you're doing here.

26:51.776 --> 26:54.179
And don't use
your telepathy on me.

26:54.214 --> 26:55.380
Promise.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.351
Hi.

27:01.386 --> 27:02.552
Where's adam?

27:02.587 --> 27:05.390
Well, he's...
finishing up.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.158
Well, they still have
to find her, don't they?

27:08.193 --> 27:11.796
Yeah,
if they want to reunite you
and put you back together.

27:11.831 --> 27:14.599
I don't want
her to be a part of me.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.166
This is normal.

27:16.201 --> 27:18.568
No, this is not normal.

27:18.603 --> 27:22.172
No, i won't let
adam do this to me.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.574
Hey, jesse and shalimar are
out there right now putting

27:24.609 --> 27:27.012
their lives on
the line to get the other
you back from genomex.

27:27.047 --> 27:30.615
If they
go to genomex there's
going to be gs agents.

27:30.650 --> 27:33.783
It could get violent.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.221
Yeah, but if they don't,
you're not going to be okay.

27:36.256 --> 27:37.822
No, it's too
dangerous, brennan.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.424
You've got to stop them.

27:39.459 --> 27:40.590
Emma, listen.

27:40.625 --> 27:43.028
It's going
to be all right.

27:43.063 --> 27:44.229
Just relax.

27:44.629 --> 27:45.795
No, it's not.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.832
I want to talk to adam.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.834
Please go get him for me.

27:50.235 --> 27:53.038
Okay.

28:08.653 --> 28:10.255
Adam,
she insisted.

28:10.290 --> 28:11.856
Okay.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.866
She programmed a lockdown.

28:27.472 --> 28:30.275
Emma, key in the security
code and let us out of here.

28:30.310 --> 28:33.078
If i do,
you'll put us back together.

28:33.113 --> 28:35.045
Well, if i don't,
you'll die.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.082
I can't be with her, adam,
she's not a part of me.

28:37.117 --> 28:38.648
Yes, she is.

28:38.683 --> 28:40.250
And you're a
part of her.

28:40.285 --> 28:41.886
Emma,
we're all on the
same team here.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.905
You need to trust us.

28:43.940 --> 28:45.890
Emma,
key in the code.

28:56.301 --> 28:59.104
As soon as we have a clear
shot we'll make our move.

28:59.139 --> 29:01.071
Exactly what is our move?

29:01.106 --> 29:03.873
You hit the
stasis regulator with an
electromagnetic pulse.

29:03.908 --> 29:08.313
Within five minutes
this whole place will
be like one giant pod.

29:08.348 --> 29:11.916
Nobody will
know what hit them,
including eckhart.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.918
The stasis field
will be unregulated.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.085
So?

29:15.120 --> 29:17.087
So everyone could die.

29:17.122 --> 29:18.723
We have to get the new
mutants out of here first.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.889
No, we don't have time.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.526
Look, that
could be us in there.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.728
If we go in
there, we'll blow it.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.530
I thought you had
a score to settle.

29:25.565 --> 29:27.897
I do.

29:27.932 --> 29:31.101
The things
eckhart did to me...

29:31.136 --> 29:34.739
think how you'll
feel when you know he'll
never hurt anyone again.

29:39.544 --> 29:42.347
Don't worry about conlan, her
powers will soon be depleted.

29:42.382 --> 29:45.367
She's got one or two
pulses left in her at best.

29:45.402 --> 29:48.353
So conlan won't be the
powerful ally i hoped for.

29:48.753 --> 29:51.156
And your experiment
is a complete failure.

29:51.556 --> 29:54.359
Two hundred and twenty
volts at eight ohms.

29:54.394 --> 29:56.326
That should
do the trick.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.763
You're not asking
for much, are you?

29:58.798 --> 30:00.765
Nothing you
can't deliver.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.767
All right,
step back.

30:16.781 --> 30:18.783
Good work.

30:23.988 --> 30:27.157
I'm so sorry, adam,
i just got scared.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.194
Yeah, well you're going
to be sorrier if we can't

30:29.594 --> 30:30.795
get you back together.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.797
Now, i want you to go to your
room and i want you to stay

30:32.832 --> 30:34.399
there until brennan
comes to get you.

30:34.434 --> 30:35.600
Do you understand me?

30:35.635 --> 30:37.167
All right, go.

30:37.202 --> 30:39.003
That was a little
harsh, wasn't it?

30:39.038 --> 30:40.805
Well, the way
this emma's acting,

30:41.206 --> 30:42.807
it's the only kind
of thing she'll understand.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.409
We've got work to do.

30:44.444 --> 30:45.610
Let's go.

30:49.614 --> 30:52.817
Emma, i don't know
if i can do this.

30:53.218 --> 30:56.020
Do you want
to live in eckhart's grip
the rest of your life?

30:56.421 --> 30:59.224
However short he makes it.

30:59.259 --> 31:01.991
No.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.993
Well, if we don't
eliminate him now,

31:04.028 --> 31:06.030
that's exactly what's
going to happen to you.

31:06.065 --> 31:09.651
And thousands of
others just like you.

31:09.686 --> 31:13.238
The regulator's
right in the middle.

31:20.845 --> 31:23.248
I may need your
help when i'm through.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.070
You did it.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.875
Come on, we've got
to get out of here fast.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.489
Adam, do you copy?

32:05.524 --> 32:06.808
Yeah, right here.

32:06.843 --> 32:08.057
What's going on?

32:08.092 --> 32:09.659
Well, we're over genomex.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.296
We scanned the area but there's
no sign of emma or conlan.

32:11.696 --> 32:14.899
Adam, i'm getting
a ready weird reading
on the spectrometer here.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.501
What kind of reading?

32:16.901 --> 32:18.067
Don't really know.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.669
I've never seen
anything like it before.

32:19.704 --> 32:21.271
It seems to cover the
entire wavelength spectrum.

32:21.306 --> 32:25.310
Conlan could have hit the
internal stasis system with one

32:25.345 --> 32:27.277
of her electromagnetic charges.

32:27.312 --> 32:29.279
Yeah, that would be
consistent with the readings.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.716
Then the entire compound could
be covered with a stasis field.

32:31.751 --> 32:34.083
Adam,
it's getting stronger.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.486
Good, that means
we've still got a chance.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.523
Jesse, hit the compound
with a microwave blast.

32:38.558 --> 32:40.089
What?

32:40.124 --> 32:41.291
Just do it now.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.328
It's the only way
to neutralize the charge.

32:51.736 --> 32:52.937
Mission accomplished.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.504
The stasis field
wasn't at full power.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.140
Maybe we caught it before
anybody's metabolism got

32:56.175 --> 32:57.742
too dangerously low.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.344
Want us to go
in and check it out?

32:59.379 --> 33:00.144
No.

33:00.545 --> 33:01.711
Find emma.

33:01.746 --> 33:03.348
Start by looking
for matty conlan.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.569
All station heads to
my office - immediately.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.337
Not again.

33:27.372 --> 33:28.973
All right,
one more time.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.392
Where is matty conlan?

33:30.427 --> 33:32.102
Man, who the hell are you?

33:32.137 --> 33:33.743
If you don't co-operate,

33:33.778 --> 33:35.780
you're going to find
out exactly who we are.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.583
Listen,
i don't know what you're
talking about, all right?

33:50.194 --> 33:50.995
Need some help?

33:51.396 --> 33:52.597
Yeah.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.007
Hey, come on
man, let's go.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.208
Let's go.

34:10.214 --> 34:11.815
Come on, man, get up.

34:25.429 --> 34:27.031
She's just a girl,
you little mamma's boy.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.232
Get your ass in there.

34:59.063 --> 35:01.466
Now, where is she?

35:04.268 --> 35:06.270
Thank you.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.880
Let me guess, you want me
to come back to sanctuary?

35:16.280 --> 35:17.882
Adam sent us
to bring you both back.

35:17.917 --> 35:20.685
You're coming with me.

35:21.085 --> 35:23.052
Like hell i am.

35:23.087 --> 35:25.089
This is
getting irritating.

35:28.693 --> 35:29.894
Got her?

35:29.929 --> 35:31.060
Oh, yeah.

35:31.095 --> 35:32.296
I got news for you.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.699
The split emma:
Heavy as a whole one.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.271
You okay?

35:42.306 --> 35:45.510
I did
something terrible.

35:45.910 --> 35:49.514
I think i hurt a
lot of people today.

35:49.914 --> 35:53.518
You talking
about genomex?

35:53.553 --> 35:56.320
We took care of it.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.723
So nobody...?

36:06.330 --> 36:08.733
That means eckhart
will be after me.

36:09.133 --> 36:12.336
Yeah,
but you stick with us we'll
make sure you're okay.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.340
Come on.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.422
Is this going to hurt?

36:31.457 --> 36:32.788
Are you kidding me?

36:32.823 --> 36:34.425
It's going
to be just fine.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.027
Hang in there.

37:04.855 --> 37:07.258
All right,
check their vital signs.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.225
Pulse is eighty-two.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.262
Blood pressure's
eighty over forty.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.863
It's about
the same over here.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.036
Can you push it any harder?

37:20.071 --> 37:21.672
No,
it's already at full power.

37:30.481 --> 37:31.682
What's going on?

37:31.717 --> 37:32.901
Perfect. Brennan.

37:32.936 --> 37:34.085
Brennan, come here.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.651
Come here.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.489
We need you
to use your powers to boost
the spectrum of the edd.

37:38.524 --> 37:41.292
Like when
emma first got split?

37:41.692 --> 37:43.494
Exactly.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.413
All right.

37:45.448 --> 37:47.374
You up for it?

37:47.409 --> 37:49.300
Whatever i can do.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.866
Sure.

37:50.901 --> 37:52.103
All right...

37:52.503 --> 37:54.505
whenever you're ready.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.107
Let's do it.

38:14.925 --> 38:16.127
Matty, don't quit.

38:16.527 --> 38:17.693
We need the power.

38:17.728 --> 38:18.929
Come on, matty,
stay with me.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.931
Come on. Come on.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.135
Good.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.738
Beautiful.

38:47.358 --> 38:48.759
Come here.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.161
Come here.

38:56.567 --> 38:57.368
Is she all right?

38:57.768 --> 38:58.534
Yeah.

38:58.569 --> 38:59.370
Yeah, she'll be okay.

38:59.770 --> 39:00.571
I got her.

39:00.971 --> 39:03.373
Okay.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.741
You okay?

39:05.776 --> 39:08.144
Yeah,
i think so.

39:08.179 --> 39:12.148
All right, well what's
the last thing you remember?

39:12.183 --> 39:16.187
Meeting matty
conlan with brennan and
then the gsa showed up.

39:16.222 --> 39:18.189
She doesn't
remember a thing.

39:18.224 --> 39:19.755
About what?

39:19.790 --> 39:23.394
Oh, about the hidden
sides of emma delauro.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.966
They had us.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.003
We would never have
known what hit us.

39:33.404 --> 39:35.406
I'd like to
continue my research.

39:35.806 --> 39:38.174
I feel we're getting close.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.213
I fully
support further exploration
to the possibilities of

39:42.248 --> 39:45.381
grafting mutancy onto
low level non-new mutants.

39:45.416 --> 39:49.820
The research subjects
would have to be
expendable, of course.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.223
Of course.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.225
Do you have
anyone in mind?

40:06.237 --> 40:07.438
We're going to set you
up with a new identity.

40:07.838 --> 40:09.405
Put you in a new town.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.442
You know, someplace safe where
eckhart's not going to be

40:11.477 --> 40:13.008
able to get his hands on you.

40:13.043 --> 40:14.645
Looks like my opportunity
to put the past behind

40:15.045 --> 40:16.212
me has finally come.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.413
Good,
well you know what?

40:17.448 --> 40:19.014
I hope you take
advantage of that.

40:19.049 --> 40:21.051
Because these opportunities
don't come around too often.

40:21.452 --> 40:22.653
Thanks, brennan.

40:23.053 --> 40:24.255
You're welcome.

40:26.657 --> 40:28.624
Okay.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.261
Ever wonder why we
never got together?

40:30.661 --> 40:33.063
Well,
i can't say that i've
never thought about it.

40:33.464 --> 40:36.632
So, how come you haven't
put the moves on me?

40:36.667 --> 40:39.870
Well,
because i don't mix
business with pleasure.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.489
Oh, that was then.

40:41.524 --> 40:43.299
How about now?

40:43.334 --> 40:45.075
Yeah, now.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.878
Now more than ever, matty,
don't you think this combination

40:47.913 --> 40:49.480
would be a little...

40:49.880 --> 40:51.682
combustible?

40:51.717 --> 40:53.484
Your loss.

40:55.085 --> 40:57.087
Where do i get
a cab around here?

40:57.122 --> 40:59.089
It's official,
you're crazy.

41:10.301 --> 41:14.270
So how insane was i?

41:14.305 --> 41:17.072
Well, which you
are we talking about?

41:17.107 --> 41:20.311
Well, i guess they
both had their moments.

41:20.711 --> 41:23.113
Yeah, well we're
all walking dichotomies.

41:23.514 --> 41:26.317
Light and dark,
good and evil.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.721
I think my
yang took over my yin.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.088
Oh, well, your yin
put up quite a fight.

41:33.123 --> 41:36.327

41:39.530 --> 41:42.698
Yeah, but if each
