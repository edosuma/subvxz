00:01.602 --> 00:04.672
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.705 --> 00:08.342
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.278
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.311 --> 00:11.745
and by the time I got here,

00:11.779 --> 00:16.016
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.486
I hid who I really was

00:18.519 --> 00:22.690
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.826
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.597
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.630 --> 00:31.532
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.565 --> 00:34.235
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.569 --> 00:39.073
I am Supergirl.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.808
KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.841 --> 00:42.543
Welcome to the DEO,
Mr. Schott.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.577
Thank you, Hank.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.845
I wanna be a reporter.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.614
You finally decided
to take the plunge.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.317
I've dreamt of this moment.
Us teaming up.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.819
So I was thinking that I stick
around for a little while.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.687
HANK HENSHAW: Did you know
she was bringing him here?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.256
No.
Is that a problem?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.424
As long as you have
kryptonite here,

00:56.457 --> 00:58.492
I can't be a part
of what you do.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.761
SUPERGIRL:
He landed on Earth last night
in a Kryptonian pod.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.596
We don't know who he is.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.832
Welcome to Cadmus.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.348
I hope to God
she shows up.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.450
Even better.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.887
Do you want to do the honors?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.357
Eh. I got to look
cool last time.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.724
I'll handle the cloud.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.560
You give 'em
what they need.

If it does,
I will let you know.

have scratched

If the bullets
don't work, right,

02:52.306 --> 02:53.641
why the punching?

02:55.343 --> 02:56.710
I just never understood that.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.614
I'm having a really good day.

HANK HENSHAW:
When you two are
done showboating,

03:03.751 --> 03:05.419
there's a renegade Kigori
in Riverside Park.

03:05.453 --> 03:06.587
SUPERGIRL: We're on it, Hank.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.359
"We're on it."

03:15.596 --> 03:16.797
Sir, yes, sir.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.832
You promised Kara
that you'd be nicer

03:18.866 --> 03:19.867
when her cousin was around.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.369
I said I would try.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.003
"Do or do not.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.506
"There is no try."

03:25.539 --> 03:29.277
Exactly how bad
did you want this job,
Mr. Schott?

03:29.310 --> 03:31.612
He'll be leaving town soon,
I'm sure.

with guns down here.
Do we, John?

04:07.515 --> 04:09.650
How did I do that?

04:09.683 --> 04:12.386
Let me give you
a little context.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.955
The Kryptonians
tried to kill you.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.659
We salvaged you, modified you
and resurrected you.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.861
And who are you?

04:20.894 --> 04:22.896
Merely a doctor.

I am a member of
an organization called Cadmus.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.603
And you...

04:29.637 --> 04:33.273
You are what we've been
waiting for, Mr. Corben.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.544
I don't believe he's ready.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.079
Is that true, John?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.350
Are you not ready to become
the man who saved the world

04:42.383 --> 04:44.352
from an alien menace?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.326
What did you do to me?

04:52.360 --> 04:55.429
I've given you a gift.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.598
I've given you life with
the very thing that will

04:57.631 --> 04:59.567
bring your enemies death.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.670
I've given you
a second chance.

I mean, I've always loved
being Supergirl. But today...

05:33.701 --> 05:35.703
Next time it would be nice
if you followed protocol

05:35.736 --> 05:37.838
and alerted us that an alien
combative was no longer

05:37.871 --> 05:39.006

It started happening
last night.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.465

DEO suddenly diverted to him.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.866
You're exposing him
to kryptonite?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.536
He's a survivor,
not a prisoner.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.737
It's a precaution.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.614
It's at the same rate
as the power drain.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.483
He's repairing himself
at a cellular level?

06:22.516 --> 06:24.652
It's like photosynthesis.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.920

the electrical energy

06:26.954 --> 06:28.989
and converting them
to chemical energy.

again. Now that he's...

he would try.

I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.044
I'm just a little dizzy.

11:54.414 --> 11:59.386
You told me that only the DEO
had access to kryptonite.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.854
So how would you
like to explain

12:00.888 --> 12:02.489
what just happened out there?

12:02.522 --> 12:05.358
A kryptonite-charged cyborg
almost killed Kara.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.726
Almost killed me.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.830
Start talking, J'onn.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.999
A shipment went missing
four months ago.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.466
We've done all we can
to find it.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.935
Four months ago?

12:14.968 --> 12:15.969
"Went missing"?

12:16.003 --> 12:17.037
Stolen.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.873
We thought it was
an inside job

12:19.907 --> 12:21.508
but everyone in the transport
came up clean.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.542
So you have a mole.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.111
We don't know that.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.213
If you'd gotten rid of it
when I told you to...

12:26.246 --> 12:29.249
We would have been helpless
when Non and Astra
launched Myriad.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.084
Or have you forgotten that
there was a force

12:31.118 --> 12:34.221
even the Man of Steel
couldn't defeat?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.323
Superman and Martian Manhunter
are gonna fight.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.490
This is terrible.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.126
This is awesome.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.261
We have given our lives
protecting the people
of Earth.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.295
If you cared about Kara
at all...

12:42.329 --> 12:43.997
Watch what you say.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.165
Or what?

12:47.434 --> 12:50.103
People of National City.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.539
The Earth has been
stolen from us.

12:52.572 --> 12:57.044
And the enemy has come
in the guise of heroes.

12:57.077 --> 13:01.414
They say they come in peace,
to protect us from ourselves.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.152
But how long will it be before
these gods decide to rule

13:05.185 --> 13:06.586
instead of serve?

13:06.619 --> 13:10.123
We are the antidote
to their poison.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.325
We are the scientists
who will show them

13:12.359 --> 13:14.294
what humans are capable of.

13:14.327 --> 13:18.431
Those who have sided with the
invaders will not be spared.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.233
You cannot stop us.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.869
We are everywhere.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.171
We are Cadmus.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.840
Cadmus.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.441
Announcing themselves
to the world.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.210
Declaring open war.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.311
They want to kill us.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.412
All of us.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.948
Cadmus has my father.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.884
If they turned John Corben
into Metallo,

13:36.917 --> 13:38.418
what do you think
they've done with him?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.053
-We'll find him.
-And stop them.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.889
How?

13:41.922 --> 13:44.191
Metallo isn't just flesh
and blood anymore.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.193
Cadmus has given him
a metal endoskeleton.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.196
Traces of the alloy
had to end up on
my hands when I hit him.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.098
I can analyze it at
the Fortress of Solitude.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.966
Agent Schott,
get Non and Astra's

13:53.000 --> 13:55.235
anti-kryptonite technology
out of storage.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.138
See if you can improve upon it
for our two friends here.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.308
I get to make
Superman's new suit?

14:01.341 --> 14:02.509
No pressure.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.481
Superman, this thing is bigger
than the both of us.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.383
We should work together
on this.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.985
I hope you like the cold.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.988
I asked for copy
five minutes ago.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.457
Am I late to the editorial
meeting? I'm sorry.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.092
You missed
the editorial meeting.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.929
If I don't get copy on Cadmus
in five seconds, you...

14:21.962 --> 14:23.263
You live another day.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.664
No one else is safe.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.166
Mr. Carr, I'm sorry.
Just tell me what I need to do

14:26.199 --> 14:27.234
and I will get it done.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.035
Where's my chair?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.970
You don't get
a chair, ponytail.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.039
That's fine. I...
I like action better anyway.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.440
I can pound the pavements.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.376
You don't get a chair because
you don't work here.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.511
But that's not your call.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.113
Ms. Grant hired me.

14:40.147 --> 14:43.216
I don't care what Cat says.
My office, my hires.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.920
But this is the job I chose.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.024
Oh, you chose it?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.293
But you didn't earn it.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.595
You don't just become
a reporter.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.464
This isn't a Facebook
status update.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.133
You're a reporter because you
went to journalism school

15:00.167 --> 15:02.035
or because you
walked the beat.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.272
Either way,
journos live to tell stories,

15:05.305 --> 15:08.908
to get to the truth,
to get their hands dirty.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.981
I'll admit I have
a lot to learn.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.049
But if...
If you just gave me
an assignment...

15:16.083 --> 15:17.350
No assignment, no job.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.020
Now get your entitled ass
out of my office

15:20.053 --> 15:22.322
before I channel
my last divorce

15:22.355 --> 15:24.624
and break you emotionally.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.294
Well, if...

15:28.761 --> 15:30.130
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

15:30.530 --> 15:32.165
You...

15:32.199 --> 15:33.300
(EXHALES)

15:33.333 --> 15:35.268
Thanks for killing
the lingering notion

15:35.302 --> 15:37.337
that you might speak
or write well.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.606
(FRUSTRATED SIGH)

15:42.009 --> 15:43.343
Ms. Grant, do you
have a minute?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.677
Do I have a minute?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.513
Do I look like I can spare
a minute, Kara?

15:46.546 --> 15:47.647
-Have you met me?
-Sorry.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.282
Thirty seconds. Spew it out.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.451
Snapper Carr, he's refusing to
acknowledge my hiring.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.621
Oh, I see. And what would you
like me to do about it?

15:54.654 --> 15:55.722
(SCOFFS)

15:55.755 --> 15:58.158
Tell him to listen to you.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.426
I'm sorry.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.061
Am I hearing things?

16:01.094 --> 16:02.996
You want me to instruct
your new boss
to be nice to you

16:03.030 --> 16:05.698
because you don't know
how to stand up for yourself?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.667
Um... Yes.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.369
Um...

16:09.402 --> 16:10.470
No.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.605
No, no and no.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.607
I will not go talk
to your new boss.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.010
I will not fix things for you,
Kara.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.745
You are a grown woman.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.214
You are smart and talented
and astonishing.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.716
And how many more times am I
gonna have to tell you this,

16:23.750 --> 16:26.453
for you to accept who you are?

16:26.486 --> 16:30.090
I just need you to pull up
your big-girl pants, Kara,

16:30.123 --> 16:31.758
and own your power.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.294
Because I'm not
gonna be around
for very much longer.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.429
What does that mean?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.368
Oh, my God.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.137
Oh, my God.
Ms. Grant, are you dying?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.107
No.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.775
-(CHUCKLES) No.
-Oh, God.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.678
No, Kara. I'm not dying.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.314
I'm leaving.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.651
Okay.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.188
The cat is out of the bag.

17:01.221 --> 17:05.425
I am taking a leave of absence
from CatCo.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.793
What?

17:06.826 --> 17:10.497
I've just done all there is
that I can do here.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.132
I'm like a shark in a tank,

17:12.165 --> 17:14.167
and I'm swimming around
in circles and I'm moving,

17:14.201 --> 17:15.535
but I'm not getting anywhere.

17:15.568 --> 17:19.606
And yes, yes. I've created
a media empire and...

17:19.639 --> 17:22.675
I'd like to think that I
spread some light in humanity

17:22.709 --> 17:24.144
out there in the world.

17:24.177 --> 17:28.315
And I launched Supergirl
for God sake. But...

17:28.348 --> 17:32.552
I've just been swimming
in the same pool for too long.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.522
There are new seas out there
that I have to go conquer.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.491
Hmm.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.193
I need to dive.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.769
(SIGHING) Everything is
changing so fast.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.209
I do not do well with change.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.153
Gosh, Ms. Grant. I...

18:08.521 --> 18:11.491
I really can't imagine
being here without you.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.429
Kara.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.102
Oh, Kara.

18:25.372 --> 18:28.441
You will rise to the occasion.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.853
Now,

18:40.887 --> 18:43.323
I want you to go in there
and show that

18:43.356 --> 18:46.793
son of a bitch Snapper
what you are made of.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.562
Chop chop.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.567
This was a total failure.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.769
He should have
never been out there at all.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.338
You think so?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.640
I'm very pleased, myself.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.509
He managed to wound Superman.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.945
Do you have any idea
how difficult that is?

19:05.978 --> 19:08.415
But the Kryptonians
are still alive.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.518
It's only a matter of time
before they strike back.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.520
On that we agree.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.256
Give me another chance
and I'll take them both out.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.724
You'll get your chance, John.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.158
I promise.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.695
We're moving to Phase Two.

19:22.729 --> 19:23.963
Phase Two?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.732
We don't even have
a suitable candidate.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.535
Actually, I've got
the perfect man for the job.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.569
Who?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.572
What is this? Wait.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.840
What are you doing?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.875
Ready to do your part
to save the world?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.211
No! Wait, stop. Please!

19:38.245 --> 19:41.481
Let me go! No!

19:41.514 --> 19:44.183
They won't even know
what hit them.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.896
Your parents?

19:58.465 --> 19:59.599
Yes.

20:01.534 --> 20:05.338
Tho-eh-lah, eh-voi-fah-zho.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.907
You speak Kryptonian.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.279
We're both men
without a home, Kal.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.982
If we don't preserve each
other's history, who will?

20:16.015 --> 20:17.584
You can't have it both ways,
J'onn.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.651
You can't offer friendship
with one hand

20:18.685 --> 20:19.719
and kryptonite with the other.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.321
-I have to.
-Why?

20:21.354 --> 20:22.889
Because Mars is a crypt.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.991
Because angry gods
burned our young

20:25.024 --> 20:27.260
and we were helpless
to stop them.

20:29.061 --> 20:33.466
Because I will not be caught
unprepared again.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.234
Hate me if you want.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.704
It is what it is.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.975
I don't hate you, J'onn.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.878
I just don't trust you.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.547
Because you don't trust me.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.948
We should have been allies.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.919
Is kryptonite really worth
us being alone in this fight?

20:55.522 --> 20:56.656
Kelex.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.591
Master Kal.
How may I assist you?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.259
Scan for unknown molecules.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.730
Film of radiation

21:03.763 --> 21:06.566
commonly associated with
contact to promethium,

21:06.599 --> 21:08.568
the strongest metal
known to man.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.736
Promethium?

21:09.769 --> 21:11.771
Now that's interesting.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.645
Hey.

21:18.678 --> 21:19.979
Any word from Hank?

21:20.012 --> 21:20.713
No.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.649
-Any word from Clark?
-Nope.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.051
I'm sure they'll figure out
a way to find Metallo soon.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.053
I just hope they don't
hurt each other

21:27.086 --> 21:28.821
while they're figuring it out.

21:31.591 --> 21:35.495
(SIGHS) I got un-hired by
my new boss yesterday.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.697
Turns out I'm not a reporter.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.400
Kara.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.834
(SIGHS) And Cat's leaving.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.537
Clark's leaving, too.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.773
Everything is changing.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.743
I'll get us some ice cream.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.746
Things will be
better tomorrow.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.482
I've been thinking though.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.818
What if I moved to Metropolis
to be with Clark.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.253
Metropolis?

22:01.287 --> 22:04.056
Yeah. I mean, think about it.
National City would be safer

22:04.090 --> 22:07.594
without me around creating
a target for Cadmus.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.962
Hank wouldn't have to worry
about me feeling uncomfortable

22:09.996 --> 22:11.531
with kryptonite around.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.767
And you, you'd be able to do
your job at the DEO

22:14.801 --> 22:16.969
without worrying about me.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.606
Alex, if I was in Metropolis,

22:19.639 --> 22:22.475
Clark and I could protect the
city and keep each other safe.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.944
And there's still so much
I want to learn from him.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.113
What do you think?

22:29.081 --> 22:32.118
I think I've kept
my mouth shut

22:32.151 --> 22:36.389
the entire time
Clark has been here
while you

22:36.423 --> 22:38.024
have ignored me.

22:38.057 --> 22:41.160
And... And now you want to
just move away?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.396
I thought it would be
good for you.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.131
You wouldn't have to take care
of me anymore.

22:45.164 --> 22:49.436
What about us taking care
of each other?

22:49.469 --> 22:54.474
My whole childhood was spent
making sure that nobody
found out.

22:54.507 --> 22:59.546
I gave up a medical career
to join the DEO for you.

22:59.579 --> 23:04.417
And my... My whole life has
been about protecting you.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.486
I thought you said it was
a great adventure.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.787
Yes.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.990
But it's cost me a lot.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.626
It cost me my father.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.662
-Alex, we're going to
find him.
-Yeah?

23:15.695 --> 23:17.864
Well, how are we
going to do that
with you in Metropolis?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.165
Don't do that.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.100
This is not about one family
over the other.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.103
This is about me
not feeling alone anymore.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.639
When I'm with Clark,
I feel like

23:26.673 --> 23:30.510
I'm connected to somebody
who actually understands

23:30.543 --> 23:33.012
what it's like to be me.

23:33.045 --> 23:36.883
So does he understand that he
abandoned you with us?

23:38.985 --> 23:41.087
-Do you?
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

23:43.956 --> 23:45.424
It's Clark.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.193
How's the Fortress?

23:47.226 --> 23:48.895
We ID'ed the material
Cadmus used

23:48.928 --> 23:50.530
to create
Metallo's endoskeleton.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.931
Agent Schott, I need to know
if there's any promethium

23:51.964 --> 23:53.466
within a hundred-mile radius.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.968
Okay. Promethium,
you hot little number.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.871
Show me a heat signature.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.674
Bingo. Atomic number 61,
come on down.

24:01.708 --> 24:02.875
That's in
the industrial district.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.544
That can't be
Cadmus' headquarters.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.646
So, at the moment
Metallo's on his own.
When?

24:06.679 --> 24:09.081
Those suits are very nearly
totally ready.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.951
And by that I mean
they're in no way ready.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.553
Kara, we're gonna have to
go with Autumn.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.954
We might not get this chance
again. Meet me there.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.155
KARA: I'm on my way.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.238
It's over, Metallo.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.641
I am happy to give myself up
for my cause.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.243
But it's not over.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.144
Not by any means.

24:38.177 --> 24:41.180
You make a move,
we'll incinerate you.

24:41.213 --> 24:41.914
Go ahead.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.083
But you'll still be here
with me.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.886
And if you're here with me,
then you're not in Metropolis
with him.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.633
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

25:00.667 --> 25:03.035
It's a setup.
We have to get to Metropolis.

25:06.806 --> 25:07.940
You better follow him,

25:07.974 --> 25:09.642
or I'll burn you alive.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.045
We'll be back.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.247
Trust me.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.657
(SIRENS WAILING)

25:32.865 --> 25:34.300
I should have been here.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.038
I should've known.

25:41.641 --> 25:42.642
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

25:42.675 --> 25:44.110
Uh, screwdriver.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.746
Ow! Watch it.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.581
I know you think
that I'm just
a pretty face here,

25:48.615 --> 25:50.750
but these hands are the real
money-makers here, okay?

25:50.783 --> 25:52.885
Sorry. I was thinking about
something else.

25:52.919 --> 25:56.055
Yeah, well, until I finish
with the Kryptonian-saving
body armor,

25:56.088 --> 25:59.058
just think with
less stabbing.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.194
Here we are, once again doing
everything we can

26:02.228 --> 26:04.163
to help Kara,
to keep her safe.

26:04.196 --> 26:07.333
Do you know the last time
I went on a date?

26:08.968 --> 26:10.803
(WHISPERS) Two years ago.

26:10.837 --> 26:12.171
You date more often than I do.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.608
-Rude.
-(ALEX EXHALES SHARPLY)

26:15.642 --> 26:17.910
You ever spent time inside
a foster home?

26:17.944 --> 26:19.345
No.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.681
Yeah. Well, I have, after
my father went to prison.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.617
And I gotta say it is nothing
but being told

26:24.651 --> 26:28.020
how grateful you should be
that someone is
taking care of you.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.389
Dude, that's not family.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.892
Family is not about
score-keeping
or who did more.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.226
It's just about showing up.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.328
So just chill with
the attitude, okay?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.631
Because I'm having
a hard enough time
getting this ready

26:38.665 --> 26:41.033
with all the trace
kryptonite in the air.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.003
What did you just say?

26:44.036 --> 26:46.205
It's like a subatomic
locker room in here.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.774
Kryptonite leaves a residue?

26:47.807 --> 26:50.910
Yeah, just like any other
radioactive substance.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.881
So if we wanted to find out
which DEO agent
stole kryptonite,

26:54.914 --> 26:56.649
helping Cadmus,

26:56.683 --> 26:59.351
maybe even help
experiment on my dad...

26:59.385 --> 27:02.789
Hey, why don't we get silly,
and take a Geiger counter

27:02.822 --> 27:04.957
to the actual locker room?

27:06.192 --> 27:07.727
What am I looking for?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.095
You're listening.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.397
It should beep.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.765
Ooh, ooh.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.000
(BEEPING)

27:14.033 --> 27:15.334
McGill?

27:16.903 --> 27:18.637
Did you file your report
this morning?

27:21.407 --> 27:23.710
Was he on the
kryptonite transport team?

27:23.743 --> 27:24.744
No.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.412
There's no reason he
should have gone near it.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.081
He's the mole.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.783
What are you gonna do?

27:36.088 --> 27:38.424
Agent McGill.
I have an assignment for you.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.392
Yes, ma'am.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.929
The President asked
that we move a portion
of our kryptonite

27:42.962 --> 27:45.131
to our stronghold in Nevada.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.999
Get a transport readied.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.802
Yes, ma'am.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.077
Winn, have you seen Alex?

27:58.110 --> 28:00.312
"Alex..." Oh, Alex Danvers.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.781
-Why?
-Uh, yeah.

28:01.814 --> 28:02.949
I need to talk to her.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.183
I haven't been very fair
to her lately.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.452
Well, she is not here.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.820
Where is she?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.922
Winn?

28:09.956 --> 28:11.223
Where is Alex?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.298
Freeze.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.933
It's not what it
looks like, Danvers.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.434
Shut up and turn around.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.036
Here's what's going to happen.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.471
I'm bringing you in.

28:25.504 --> 28:28.107
And you're gonna tell me
everything you know
about Cadmus.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.111
No, I'm not.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.247
(GRUNTS)

28:37.116 --> 28:39.852
Agent Danvers of the DEO.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.220
Nice to meet you.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.255
I'll tell your father
you say hello.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.828
Where's my father?

28:48.861 --> 28:50.262
You know I won't say.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.098
Well, you might
as well tell me,
if you're gonna kill me.

28:52.131 --> 28:55.434
I suggest you die
remembering him as he was.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.369
It's better that way.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.038
Unless you'd care to join him.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.873
Cadmus welcomes
any bright minds

29:00.907 --> 29:02.842
willing to help our cause.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.244
My father would never
collaborate with you.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.814
Do you know what I see
when I look at you?

29:07.847 --> 29:09.982
An abused child.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.384
A brainwashed little girl
the DEO

29:12.418 --> 29:17.857
has warped into believing
that demons are angels.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.326
That your life should be
sacrificed to them,

29:21.293 --> 29:22.428
our invaders.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.398
All I'm asking, Alex,
is for you to think about

29:26.432 --> 29:31.203
what your life would be
if aliens had never come.

29:31.237 --> 29:34.406
What it could be,
if they were no more.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.076
That's what I'm trying to do
for the world.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.311
And you could help me.

29:39.345 --> 29:42.014
I've killed
a Kryptonian before.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.116
I stabbed Astra
of the House of El

29:44.150 --> 29:45.417
with a sword
made of kryptonite.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.888
I've done what you want to do.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.222
What you can't do.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.457
I'm impressed.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.159
Good.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.261
Because I want you to know
what I'm capable of

29:55.294 --> 29:57.563
when I tell you that
when I find my father,

29:57.596 --> 29:59.231
I'm coming for you.

30:00.366 --> 30:04.103
Well, I suppose
that settles that, then.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.211
(ALEX GRUINTING)

30:52.919 --> 30:54.153
You okay?

30:54.186 --> 30:55.554
Yeah. Thanks to you.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.657
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so sorry
for everything. I...

30:58.690 --> 31:00.326
I'm sorry if I ever have
made you feel like

31:00.359 --> 31:02.194
you were less to me
than Clark.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.997
You are the only reason
I've ever felt at home
on this planet.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.599
I'm just better when
we're together.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.001
Me, too.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.505
They think we're divided,
but we're not.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.075
"They" who?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.509
I know what to do
about Metallo.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.610
Both Metallos.

31:18.644 --> 31:19.678
But I need you.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.147
I'm here.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.181
Always.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.218
Okay. So, this is
a bit of a rush job,

31:26.252 --> 31:28.087
but they should
keep you alive.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.256
What do you think?

31:30.289 --> 31:32.258
-Nice job, Mr. Schott.
You should be...
-Not you.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.126
I love it.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.397
Are you crying?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.066
No.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.600
So, what's the plan?

31:41.633 --> 31:43.335
Well, Cadmus thinks that we

31:43.369 --> 31:44.971
are above the rest
of the world,

31:45.004 --> 31:47.139
that we'll retreat alone
to our own cities,

31:47.173 --> 31:48.574
just wait for them
to come and get us.

31:48.607 --> 31:52.011
What they won't be expecting
is for us to have backup.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.181
We're listening.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.551
The Kryptonians
have parted ways.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.020
They're pretending at honor,

32:01.053 --> 32:03.489
standing in
each of their cities.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.357
This is their weakness.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.393
The ego of gods.

32:09.728 --> 32:13.165
Now's the time to strike,
when they're alone.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.567
No one will stand
with them now.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.269
Divided, they'll fall.

32:33.119 --> 32:34.520
I told you I'd be back.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.622
And I told you
I'd burn you alive.

punch your face.

Strength in numbers.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.177
And now it's really over.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.586
You thought you could divide
and conquer?

34:14.620 --> 34:17.323
You might work better alone,
but we don't.

34:37.743 --> 34:38.744
(BOTH GRUNTING)

35:10.776 --> 35:13.679
Now, we're gonna give you
a little time-out

35:13.712 --> 35:15.647
and you're gonna think about
what you did.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.256
(SCREAMING)

35:31.630 --> 35:32.631
Alex, now!

35:46.912 --> 35:48.314
Can you see me?

35:49.948 --> 35:51.883
Can you hear me?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.852
This is not over.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.421
I will find you.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.325
Then it begins.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.438
Will you miss it?

36:13.439 --> 36:15.441
Who told you I was leaving?

36:16.975 --> 36:18.710
-A little bird.
-Little plane?

36:20.011 --> 36:22.248
Yes. Yes, I will...

36:22.281 --> 36:24.483
I will miss CatCo every day.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.986
Well, I admire you, Ms. Grant.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.722
It's scary leaving the life
you've known.

36:30.756 --> 36:31.923
CAT: Hmm.

36:33.124 --> 36:36.828
I'm about to take a leap
into the unknown
and... And I'm...

36:36.862 --> 36:39.631
I'm thrilled.

36:39.665 --> 36:42.401
Do you have any idea how
exciting it is not to know

36:42.434 --> 36:44.703
what I'm going to do tomorrow?

36:44.736 --> 36:45.837
It's exhilarating.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.873
(CHUCKLES)

36:47.906 --> 36:50.309
I wish I could
do that, sometimes.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.711
Start something new.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.246
Be someone new.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.847
Hmm, well...

36:55.881 --> 36:57.449
Life is long.

36:57.483 --> 37:00.386
And you will be many different
people before the end.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.321
And knowing you,

37:02.354 --> 37:05.324
every single one of them
will be extraordinary.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.326
But not as extraordinary
as me.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.695
No, well...
Of course not.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.864
That's very true, Cat.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.033
Have I ever told you that my
name is Catherine?

37:15.066 --> 37:16.668
I'm not telling you
my real name.

37:16.702 --> 37:17.703
I had to try.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.506
-I know. (CHUCKLES)
-It's the reporter in me.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.245
Be safe, Supergirl.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.283
You, too.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.652
And come back.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.789
I know we all need change,

37:37.823 --> 37:39.291
but we need friends, too.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.260
Oh, I'll be back.

37:43.662 --> 37:44.663
I will.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.006
What's going on?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.775
New beginnings.

37:56.808 --> 37:57.943
Where are you going?

37:57.976 --> 37:59.778
And are you going
because of me?

37:59.811 --> 38:01.980
Not far and no,
I'm doing this for me.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.382
I'm the new Cat.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.616
Well, not the new Cat.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.485
She gave me her job
while she's away.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.519
-Wow.
-Yeah!

38:07.553 --> 38:09.421
It's a big step up, right?

38:09.455 --> 38:11.790
And... And I can talk to
Snapper for you, if you want.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.959
I appreciate that.
But I'm gonna have to

38:13.992 --> 38:15.594
make my own luck on that one.

38:16.695 --> 38:17.996
Congrats,

38:18.029 --> 38:19.064
boss.

38:19.097 --> 38:20.466
I like the sound of it.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.800

-You don't work here.
-Yes, I do.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.020
Not if I don't say so.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.723
You will.
Read it and you'll see.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.871
You done wasting my time?

38:59.905 --> 39:01.139
You don't want it?
Fine.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.442
Plenty of other outlets will.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.343
Wait.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.518
I don't like you,
and I never will, ponytail.

I don't need you to like me,
jerk guy.

You're as bad at insults
as you are at reporting.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.697
Come back tomorrow.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.366
Maybe I can
teach you something.

-No.

the right thing, Superman.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.919
Thank you.

39:52.491 --> 39:54.125
I'm going to miss you, Winn.

Oh!

Next time, let's...Let's...
Let's really hang out.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.768
Yeah.

40:02.801 --> 40:03.802
Alex.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.807
I will do everything I can
to find Jeremiah, I promise.

Thank you.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.647
What... What's that mean?

40:15.681 --> 40:19.217
There's not really a word
for it in your language.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.587
I guess the closest thing
would be...

40:22.120 --> 40:23.755
"To be continued"?

40:30.829 --> 40:31.863
I love you, Kara.

I love you too, Kal.

I'll be here for you.
