OF THE RAILROAD TRACKS.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.067
HE'S FACING NORTHBOUND.

08:35.100 --> 08:39.167
-Radio:  WHERE'S HE AT
FROM WHERE I'M AT? I'M IN
THE CORNER WHERE HE JUMPED?

08:39.267 --> 08:42.133
-HE'S ON THE NORTH SIDE
OF SOME TREES AND BUSHES.

08:42.233 --> 08:46.600
PROBABLY OUT OF YOUR LINE
OF SIGHT. BUT I'VE GOT A PERFECT
VIEW ON HIM FROM WHERE I'M AT.

08:46.700 --> 08:50.067
IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S TIRED.
HE'S RESTING RIGHT NOW
AGAINST THE FENCE

08:50.133 --> 08:51.767
TO THE WEST OF
THE RAILROAD TRACKS.

08:51.867 --> 08:53.433
SEE HIM? STRAIGHT WEST.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.567
NO, TO THE LEFT. KEEP GOING.
LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT.
RIGHT THERE.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.800
-Man on radio:
WHO HAS AN EYE ON HIM NOW?

08:58.900 --> 09:00.967
-26, HE'S GOING NORTHBOUND.

09:01.067 --> 09:03.067
HE'S GONNA BE GOING NORTHBOUND.

09:03.167 --> 09:07.433
HE'S-- HE'S GOT NOTHING
IN HIS HANDS, BUT HE'S
WALKING NORTH...

09:07.533 --> 09:09.733
UP ON THE TRACKS.

09:12.367 --> 09:15.067
GET ON THE GROUND NOW!
-Radio: GET A FLASHLIGHT ON HIM.

09:15.167 --> 09:17.467
-ON THE GROUND NOW!

09:17.567 --> 09:19.933
GET ON THE GROUND!
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

09:23.833 --> 09:24.900
SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

09:25.067 --> 09:26.167
SHOW ME YOUR OTHER HAND!

09:26.267 --> 09:27.900
-GOT ME COVERED?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.167
-SHOW ME YOUR OTHER HAND!

09:37.133 --> 09:39.067
RELAX, OR WE'LL TASE YOU, DUDE.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.233
-HE'S THE ONLY ONE OUTSTANDING?

09:42.333 --> 09:43.500
-YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.933
-WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT
BEFORE OVER HERE?

09:45.067 --> 09:47.500
-UH, TO THE SOUTH
AND THEN TO THE EAST.

09:49.067 --> 09:50.267
-CLEAR. NO GUN HERE.

09:50.367 --> 09:51.767
-WHERE'S THE GUN?

09:51.867 --> 09:53.333
-I TOSSED IT.
-WHERE AT?

09:53.433 --> 09:55.400
-RIGHT OVER THERE.
-RIGHT OVER WHERE?
TELL ME WHERE.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.633
-OVER THAT WAY SOMEWHERE.
-OVER HERE?

09:56.733 --> 09:58.067
-ALL RIGHT, I SAW HIM WHERE
HE STOLE--

09:58.100 --> 09:59.867
-HE'S SAYING HE TOSSED
THE GUN RIGHT DOWN THERE.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.933
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, STAND UP
FOR ME.

10:06.033 --> 10:07.867
-HE WAS LEANING
AGAINST THAT FENCE.

10:07.967 --> 10:10.000
-DO WE KNOW IF HE ACTUALLY
EVER HAD IT?

10:10.100 --> 10:12.500
-I HOPE Y'ALL NOTICE.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.367
AND Y'ALL (indistinct)
GOT MY GUN.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.233
THE FASTEST (bleep)
GUN IN THE WEST!

10:17.333 --> 10:19.600
YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE
WALKING TO, RIGHT?
-YOU TRYING TO SHOOT US?

10:19.700 --> 10:22.167
-OH, GOD. NO, THEY ALREADY
GOT ME SET UP FOR THAT.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.767
-ANYBODY GOT SHOT?

10:26.867 --> 10:29.067
-WE DONE AT THIS POINT.
DONE WITH THIS!

10:29.167 --> 10:31.233
NO, (bleep)
-STOP!

10:31.333 --> 10:32.833
-WE NEED A VAN.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.200
-YEAH, WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET ONE.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.900
WE DON'T HAVE ONE
ON SOUTH, THOUGH.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.233
-(radio chatter)
-STAND UP!

10:38.333 --> 10:39.767
-SET HIM DOWN.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.067
-COME ON, LET'S GO!

10:41.167 --> 10:43.733
-LET'S KEEP HIM ON HIS SIDE.
-I GOT THIS. I GOT THIS.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.767
-YOU'RE DONE.
-KEEP HIM ON HIS SIDE.

10:45.867 --> 10:48.733
-(babbling)
-WE GOT A MAN COMING FOR YOU.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.500
-MIGHT HAVE E.M.S.
COME CHECK HIM.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.133
PUPILS ARE SO DILATED.

10:52.233 --> 10:53.633
-SHOOT ME.

10:53.733 --> 10:55.000
-HEY.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.000
-YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.
-YOU WANT TO.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.267
-YOU'RE LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.700
-HEY.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.567

11:02.667 --> 11:04.167
-YOU A BITCH!
-LET ME TALK TO YOU.

11:04.267 --> 11:05.833
-YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE
AND BLEW IT, BITCH.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.100
-LET ME TALK TO YOU.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.367
-YOU WANT IT SO BAD RIGHT NOW.

11:08.467 --> 11:09.967
-NOPE.
-YOU NOT LIKE IT ANYMORE.

11:10.067 --> 11:12.267
(incoherent rambling)
WHATEVER THE (bleep)
THEY SAY, BITCH.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.067
-WHAT'S YOUR DATE OF BIRTH?

11:14.133 --> 11:15.467
-THAT'S MY (bleep) DATE.

11:15.567 --> 11:18.200
(yelling)

11:18.300 --> 11:20.600
-LET'S JUST PUT HIM
IN THE BACK OF MY TAHOE.
-COME ON, BUB.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.533
-HE'S A SPITTER. WATCH OUT.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.333
-WE GOT HIM FOR YOU.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.667
-I WILL FIGHT
TO GET THESE PANTS UP!

11:27.767 --> 11:29.567
-WE GOT 'EM UP, BROTHER.
THEY CAN'T GO UP ANY HIGHER.

11:29.667 --> 11:33.267
-(gasping) (bleep)

11:35.167 --> 11:36.467
YOU, THERE YOU ARE.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.233
YOU SIT THERE WITH THAT SMILE.
-COME ON.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.600
-YOU WANT IT BAD.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.500
-JUST STEP UP.
-AAH! IT HURTS SO GOOD!

11:41.600 --> 11:45.667
-STEP ON UP.
-AAH! COME SEE ME
LATER, HONEY.

11:45.767 --> 11:46.933
-WATCH YOUR HEAD.

11:47.067 --> 11:48.333
-Y'ALL ARREST ME.
Y'ALL ARE GREAT POLICE.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.533
-YOU GOTTA DUCK DOWN, MAN.
-YOU CAN GET ME IN.

11:50.633 --> 11:52.300
PUSH ME IN. HA!

11:52.400 --> 11:55.400
I'M GONNA MESS HIM UP.
MAKE ME A WINNER, GOD DAMN IT.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.900
AAH!

11:58.067 --> 12:01.400
-I MEAN, THERE WAS JUST--
I COULDN'T SEE WHAT OFFICER
WAS RUNNING IN FRONT OF ME.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.600
-YEAH.
-WHEN HE PUT HIS HANDS OUT
LIKE THAT,

12:03.700 --> 12:06.967
I MEAN, I-- I ALMOST.
I WAS VERY CLOSE
TO SHOOTING HIM.

12:07.067 --> 12:08.800
-OH, YEAH.
THIS IS A...

12:08.900 --> 12:13.067
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF MORE
OF LIKE A SUICIDE-
BY-COP SITUATION.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.667
-HE LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT--
HE MIGHT BE ON SOMETHING
OR-- I DON'T KNOW.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.633
-YEAH, HE'S PROBABLY
METHED OUT.

12:18.733 --> 12:21.867
I'M SURE. HE WAS TELLING ME
IT'S HIS LUCKY DAY.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.733
HE WAS KIND OF INSULTING US
FOR NOT SHOOTING HIM,

12:24.833 --> 12:27.700
WHICH IS KINDA HINTING TOWARDS
THAT HE WAS WANTING US
TO SHOOT HIM.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.200
-APPARENTLY, HE CAME AROUND
THE CORNER HERE,

12:30.300 --> 12:33.067
AND THEN WENT INTO HIS YARD
AND HE WAS LIKE, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?"

12:33.100 --> 12:35.267
AND THEN HE BEAT UP THAT GUY
ON THE FRONT PORCH,

12:35.367 --> 12:37.267
AND HE'S GOT SOME
PRETTY GOOD VISIBLE INJURIES.

12:37.367 --> 12:39.267
-SO, HE ASSAULTED THAT GUY
AS WELL?
-YEAH.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.400
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW
THE FEMALE RUN OUT THERE.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.733
'CAUSE SHE HEARD--
-SCREAMING.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.467
-YEAH, SHE'S SCREAMING.

12:44.567 --> 12:46.933
SO, HE BEAT HIM UP,
AND HE'S PRESSING CHARGES.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.767
-OKAY.

12:48.867 --> 12:51.433
-AND THE OTHER PEOPLE
THAT ARE ACROSS THE STREET
SAID THERE WAS A GUN SOMEWHERE.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.433
BUT-- SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN
GET A DOG OUT TO CHECK.

12:53.533 --> 12:54.733
-CHECK FOR THE GUN.
-YEAH.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.300
-OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.067
-E.M.S. IS GONNA GIVE HIM
SOME MEDICATION REAL QUICK.
-OH, GOOD.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.567
EXCELLENT.
-TRY TO CALM HIM DOWN.

12:59.667 --> 13:01.633
-JUST SEDATE HIM
A LITTLE BIT.
-YEAH, SO...

13:01.733 --> 13:04.333
-YES. E.M.S. IS GONNA BE
TRANSPORTING HIM DOWN
TO THE HOSPITAL.

13:04.433 --> 13:07.833
THEY'RE GONNA DO SOME
TESTS ON HIM, MAKE SURE
HE'S OKAY TO BE RELEASED.

13:07.933 --> 13:10.800
THEN ONCE THEY RELEASE HIM,
THEN WE'RE GONNA BOOK HIM
INTO JAIL.

13:14.633 --> 13:17.333
-Patrolman Wright: SOME OF
THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN
THIS CITY ARE JUST-- WE'RE BUSY.

13:17.433 --> 13:20.067
WE GET A LITTLE BIT
OF EVERYTHING.
STREET CRIME, ROBBERIES,

13:20.133 --> 13:22.067
SOMETIMES JUST HELPING
PEOPLE OUT.

13:22.100 --> 13:25.567
THE DRUGS ARE RAMPANT.
LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE TRIPPING
OVER DRUG DEALS.

13:25.667 --> 13:30.067
BUT IT'S ALWAYS BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING THE DEALER
AND NOT JUST THE BUYER.

13:30.167 --> 13:34.367
WE'RE HEADING TO A CONVENIENCE
STORE FOR A SUPPOSED DISTURBANCE
GOING ON INSIDE THE STORE.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.233
IT WAS CALLED IN BY
AN OFF-DUTY OFFICER.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.300
LOOKS LIKE IT'S ONGOING.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.167
-I WILL IF YOU LISTEN TO ME!
-I'M TRYING TO.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.533
-HE WAS THE TROUBLE OF IT ALL.

13:48.633 --> 13:49.867
OKAY?
-CALM DOWN.

13:49.967 --> 13:51.567
-I DON'T CARE!
-HEY, HEY, HEY!

13:51.667 --> 13:52.900
-HEY, TAKE HER OVER.

13:53.067 --> 13:55.500
-OH, REALLY? REALLY?
-YEAH.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.067
-REALLY?
-OWW!

13:57.133 --> 14:00.267
NOW YOU GOT AN A&B D.W.
ON A POLICE OFFICER FOR
KICKING ME.

14:00.367 --> 14:02.267
-STAY STILL. STAY STILL!

14:02.367 --> 14:05.333
-CUFF HER.
(shouting continues)

14:05.433 --> 14:07.067
JUST CUFF HER.
-STAND STILL!

14:07.100 --> 14:10.067
-CUFF HER. CUFF HER.
-AAH!

14:12.333 --> 14:14.733
-(crying)

14:17.867 --> 14:21.700
YOU LITTLE (bleep)
PUT ME OFF!

14:21.800 --> 14:23.100
OWW!

14:23.200 --> 14:25.400
ALL I DID WAS--

14:25.500 --> 14:27.600
-DON'T DO THAT TO HER, PLEASE!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.833
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED!

14:29.933 --> 14:32.200
WILL YOU JUST LISTEN TO US?
-PUT HER IN THE CAR.
IS YOUR CAR UNLOCKED?

14:32.300 --> 14:34.067
-PLEASE, LISTEN TO US!

14:34.167 --> 14:36.467
-YOU'RE GONNA BE NEXT.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.100
-PLEASE, LISTEN TO US.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.400
PLEASE, HONEST, I SWEAR
TO GOD, PLEASE, LISTEN TO ME.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.067
-THAT GUY JUST WALKED UP!

14:48.100 --> 14:51.467
HE SLAPPED ME IN
THE (bleep) FACE.
-PUT YOUR FOOT UP.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.167
GET YOUR FOOT IN THE CAR.
COME ON.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.067
-YEAH, GET MY FOOT IN THE CAR.
-COME ON. GET IN THE CAR.
GET IN THE CAR.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.133
-(bleep) YOU! (bleep) YOU!

14:59.067 --> 15:00.467
OWW!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.800
-SIT UP. SIT UP.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.533
SHE GAVE ME A LITTLE KICK
IN THE LEG, SO SHE'S GOING
AT LEAST

15:07.633 --> 15:09.467
FOR DISORDERLY AND ASSAULT
AND BATTERY DANGEROUS WEAPON.

15:09.567 --> 15:12.100
-THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND!
I NEVER TOUCHED HIM.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.333
-DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.900
MISS, FORGET ABOUT IT.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.
-DISORDERLY CONDUCT?

15:17.067 --> 15:20.200
HOW DO YOU GET DISORDERLY
CONDUCT? I NEVER EVEN
TOUCHED HIM.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.900
-YOU'RE CREATING A SCENE.
-NO.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.533
-SHE'S RUNNING AT OFFICERS.
SHE PUSHED ME.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.533
-SHE JUST KICKED ME
IN THE LEGS. SO SHE GOT
A.B.D.W.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.067
OH, WAIT A MINUTE, I KNOW YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
-NO, (bleep) YOU KNOW ME!

15:28.133 --> 15:29.333
-SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?
-NOTHING!

15:29.433 --> 15:32.167
LET ME EXPLAIN.
PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU.

15:32.267 --> 15:34.400
HER AND I WERE
FIGHTING HERE, OKAY?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.400
-WHO'S FIGHTING?
-AND THEN THAT GUY
CAME OVER HERE.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.467
-YOU TWO, YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
WERE FIGHTING?
-ME AND MY FRIEND.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.233
THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND, OKAY?

15:40.333 --> 15:44.700
SO, WE'RE ARGUING, AND ALL OF
A SUDDEN HE POPS INTO THE WHOLE
FREAKING SITUATION.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.100
-YEAH. TRYING TO STOP
THE FIGHT?
-AND-- YEAH.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.767
-WELL, WE WEREN'T FIGHTING!
WE WERE JUST ARGUING.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.667
-WHATEVER IT WAS--
-WE WERE JUST YELLING
AT EACH OTHER.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.400
RIGHT? SO, WE'RE JUST
YELLING AT EACH OTHER--

15:53.500 --> 15:54.767
"I'M CALLING THE COPS."

15:54.867 --> 15:57.433
CALL THE (bleep) COPS.
I DON'T CARE! CALL THE COPS!

15:57.533 --> 15:58.700
I DON'T CARE!
-OKAY.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.067
-SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
I DON'T CARE.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.767
-OKAY.
-I'M DRIVING HER HOME,
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

16:04.867 --> 16:07.667
AND THEN HE TELLS ME
I TOUCHED HIM?!

16:07.767 --> 16:09.867
YOU KNOW ME.
-WELL, THAT'S...

16:09.967 --> 16:13.800
HE TOOK OFF, SO HE--
-EXACTLY. BECAUSE HE KNOWS
HE'S WRONG.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.200
-BUT, YOUR FRIEND IS GOING OFF,
AND SHE'S--

16:16.300 --> 16:18.267
-WELL, SHE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.
-WAIT, JUST LISTEN TO ME.

16:18.367 --> 16:21.067
SHE'S GOING OFF YELLING
AND SCREAMING, AND THEN
SHE KICKS ME IN THE LEG.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.967
AND THEN--
-BUT SHE'S TRYING
TO PROTECT ME, THOUGH.

16:23.067 --> 16:27.700
THE THING IS-- YOU WEREN'T ANY
SAFER THAN BEING WITH THREE
POLICE OFFICERS, THOUGH?

16:27.800 --> 16:30.500
-CAN I PLEASE JUST DRIVE
HER HOME? I HONESTLY--
-SHE'S UNDER ARREST.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.200
-SHE CAN'T BE.
SHE'S GOT HER BAG OVER THERE.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.667
COME ON, PLEASE.
-WELL, WE'LL BRING HER BAG
WITH US. AND HER SHOE WITH US,

16:34.767 --> 16:36.300
BUT SHE'S UNDER ARREST.
-COME ON, PLEASE, PLEASE?

16:36.400 --> 16:39.400
-JUST LISTEN.
-YOU KNOW ME! YOU KNOW ME!
I'M A GOOD PERSON!

16:39.500 --> 16:41.500
-LISTEN TO ME, I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A BAD PERSON.
-YOU KNOW ME!

16:41.600 --> 16:44.067
YOU KNOW MY SON!
I'M A GOOD PERSON!
-I KNOW! LISTEN TO ME.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.133
LISTEN TO ME.
-COME ON, YOU CAN'T ARREST HER.

16:46.233 --> 16:47.700
SHE'S GOTTA COME HOME
WITH ME.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.800
-WELL, YOU CAN COME.
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE
MONEY ON HER,

16:49.900 --> 16:52.433
YOU CAN BRING $40 DOWN
TO HER. AND PLUS, SHE'S DRUNK.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.700
-YEAH, 'CAUSE I'M DRIVING
HER HOME.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.767
-SHE'S NOT CALMING DOWN.
IF SHE'S ARGUING WITH YOU
SO MUCH,

16:56.867 --> 16:58.200
SHE'S NOT CALMING

16:58.300 --> 16:59.767
-NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
-DO ME A FAVOR.

16:59.867 --> 17:02.533
-CAN I HAVE THAT BAG?
-WELL, WE'RE GONNA GIVE HER
HER PROPERTY.

17:02.633 --> 17:05.633
DO ME A FAVOR. TALK TO
THIS OFFICER, OKAY?
LISTEN TO HIM.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.367
LISTEN TO HIM.
-PLEASE, DON'T DO THAT

17:07.467 --> 17:09.133
JENNA, I NEED YOU

17:09.233 --> 17:11.233

17:11.333 --> 17:13.633
-(crying)
-THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON, OKAY?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.500

17:15.600 --> 17:17.700
ALL RIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TALK TO ME IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO,

17:17.800 --> 17:19.200
BUT I JUST WANT YOU

17:19.300 --> 17:21.767
ALL RIGHT?
-(crying)

17:21.867 --> 17:23.633
-ALL RIGHT.
HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TO DRINK?

17:23.733 --> 17:25.933
-A LOT.
-WHAT, YOU GUYS
AT THE BEACH DRINKING?

17:26.067 --> 17:29.067
ALL RIGHT. YOU HAD A LOT.
SO, YOU'RE NOT ACTING
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

17:29.133 --> 17:32.067
-I NEED TO TAKE MY HAIR
OUT OF MY FACE.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.300
-JENNIFER, JUST CALM DOWN.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.833

17:34.933 --> 17:36.700
YOU JUST GOTTA KEEP
CALMING DOWN, OKAY?
-ALL RIGHT.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.767
-IT'S JUST TOUGH TO TALK
TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY'RE THIS
UPSET AND YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.

17:39.867 --> 17:41.733
-I'M THIS UPSET?
-YOUR FRIEND'S OKAY.

17:41.833 --> 17:43.300

-MY FRIEND. OKAY.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.533

YOU WERE DISORDERLY--
-(mumbling drunkenly)

17:51.833 --> 17:54.200
-COMPLETELY YELLING
AND CAUSING A SCENE, ALL RIGHT?

17:54.300 --> 17:56.267
-(laughing)
-AND YOU KICKED ME.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.867
-OH, I KICKED YOU?
-YEAH.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.367
YOU KICKED ME RIGHT
IN THE LEG.

18:01.467 --> 18:02.700
-I'M SORRY.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.700
-THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
UNDER ARREST.
-OH.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.400
-BUT HERE'S THE BRIGHT SIDE.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.700
UNLESS YOU HAVE OUT--
LISTEN TO ME.
-(mumbling)

18:08.800 --> 18:12.633
-UNLESS YOU HAVE OUTSTANDING
WARRANTS, OR YOU HAVE A BIG
CASE HANGING OVER YOUR HEAD,

18:12.733 --> 18:14.700
YOU WILL BAIL RIGHT OUT.
DO YOU HAVE MONEY ON YOU?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.800
-NO, I...
-IT COSTS $40 TO BAIL OUT.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.500
YOUR FRIEND WILL PROBABLY
BRING IT DOWN FOR YOU.

18:18.600 --> 18:22.967
OKAY? SO, WHY WERE YOU
KINDA GOING AFTER YOUR FRIEND?

18:23.067 --> 18:26.567
-BECAUSE I'M A DRUNK ALCOHOLIC.

18:26.667 --> 18:28.900
-OKAY. SO, HOW ABOUT
GETTING HELP?

18:29.067 --> 18:30.667
-(crying)

18:30.767 --> 18:33.500
-I MEAN, BEING OUT IN THE SUN
AND DRINKING ISN'T GONNA BE
ANY GOOD FOR YOU.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.533
THAT HEADACHE'S NOT GONNA
BE FUN TOMORROW.
-NO, IT'S NOT.

18:36.633 --> 18:39.067
MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T
LOVE ME ANYMORE.

18:39.133 --> 18:40.867
IT'S JUST--

18:40.967 --> 18:42.600
-SO, HOW ABOUT GETTING
RID OF HIM?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.800
JUST TRY TO RELAX.

18:44.900 --> 18:47.633
WE'LL BE WITH YOU, ALL RIGHT?

18:47.733 --> 18:50.833
-WE WERE NOT
DISRUPTING ANYBODY.

18:50.933 --> 18:52.867
-OKAY, WELL, DISORDERLY
CONDUCT IS WHEN

18:52.967 --> 18:55.067
PEOPLE START PAYING ATTENTION
TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

18:55.133 --> 18:57.633
WHOEVER'S DOING THE YELLING,
ALL THAT.

18:57.733 --> 19:00.533
WHEN I PULLED UP, I COULD
HEAR HER WHEN I WAS PULLING
ON THE STREET.

19:00.633 --> 19:03.733
BECAUSE-- WAIT. BECAUSE
THEY PULLED UP BEFORE YOU.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.967
-RIGHT.
-AND THEY HAD ME CORNERED.

19:06.067 --> 19:07.567
THAT'S WHY SHE WENT OFF.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.300
-WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.867
-HE WAS TRYING TO TALK TO ME,
BUT SHE WAS NERVOUS.

19:11.967 --> 19:14.067
SHE THOUGHT THAT THEY
WERE GONNA ARREST ME.
THAT'S WHY.

19:14.167 --> 19:16.667
-YOU WEREN'T ACTING UP
WHEN I PULLED UP.
-I WOULD NEVER ACT UP.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.800
-AND SHE--
-I HAVE NO NEED TO ACT UP.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.067
WELL, SHE'S UNDER ARREST
FOR DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.533
-OH, GOD.
-AND THEN SHE KICKED ME

19:22.633 --> 19:24.867
FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY
DANGEROUS WEAPON ON
A POLICE OFFICER.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.267
-COME ON.

19:26.367 --> 19:28.700
-DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER IT HURT
OR DIDN'T HURT OR WHATEVER.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.067
SHE TURNED HER HEAD,
AIMED, AND KICKED.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.233
-BUT YOU KNOW ME.
I WOULD NEVER

19:33.333 --> 19:35.400
EVER DO ANYTHING.
-DOESN'T MEAN-- YEAH.
AND YOU HAVEN'T--

19:35.500 --> 19:37.100
AND YOU HAVEN'T TRIED
TO BEAT ME UP YET.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.633
-(laughing)
-BUT SHE DID.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.900
-"YET."
-SO, SHE TRIED,
SO SHE'S UNDER ARREST.

19:41.067 --> 19:42.167
-OKAY.
-SHE'S DRUNK.

19:42.267 --> 19:43.733
-OKAY.
-SHE NEEDS TO SLEEP IT OFF
A LITTLE BIT.

19:43.833 --> 19:45.367
-SO, I HAVE TO GO DOWN
TO THE POLICE STATION?

19:45.467 --> 19:47.600
-GO DOWN TO THE LYNN POLICE
STATION AND BRING $40 FOR HER.
-OH, JEEZ.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.967
-OKAY? GOOD LUCK.

19:50.467 --> 19:51.500
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.167
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:53.267 --> 19:54.933
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:55.067 --> 19:55.967
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:56.067 --> 19:59.100
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.333 --> 20:07.267
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:07.367 --> 20:08.933
-(theme music playing)
