00:02.602 --> 00:05.757
<i>The 1970s were
an awesome time to be a kid.</i>

00:05.797 --> 00:07.698
<i>It was the Wild West.</i>

00:07.732 --> 00:09.933
<i>Bike helmets hadn't been
invented yet or car seatbelts</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:12.603
<i>or even normal adult supervision.</i>

00:12.637 --> 00:14.605
<i>Dads weren't around
as much as they are now.</i>

00:14.639 --> 00:16.740
<i>And my mom was busy running the house.</i>

00:16.775 --> 00:20.043
<i>She had a lot on her plate
and no time for tomfoolery...</i>

00:20.078 --> 00:21.211
<i>whatever that is.</i>

00:21.246 --> 00:22.412
<i>There were eight of us boys,</i>

00:22.447 --> 00:25.382
<i>including my oldest brother,
just home from college.</i>

00:25.416 --> 00:27.985
<i>That's a lot of testosterone
under one roof.</i>

00:29.487 --> 00:32.389
<i>Mouse, you'll do.</i>

00:32.423 --> 00:34.291
<i>When I was a kid,
nothing bugged my mom more</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:35.940
<i>than seeing us happy and relaxed.</i>

00:35.979 --> 00:37.669
You're not gonna
spend the summer lounging around

00:37.737 --> 00:39.730
like it's some filthy mud-pit
at Woodstock.

00:39.764 --> 00:41.732
Outside.

00:41.766 --> 00:44.168
<i>We were expected to get summer jobs,</i>

00:44.202 --> 00:45.936
<i>and since I was the creative type,</i>

00:45.970 --> 00:47.237
<i>I always sought work which allowed me to</i>

00:47.272 --> 00:48.605
<i>express myself as an artist.</i>

00:48.640 --> 00:51.408
Tell me... did you go to school, stupid?

00:51.442 --> 00:54.891
Yeah. And I came out the same way!

00:56.481 --> 00:58.982
<i>Unfortunately,
a mysterious basement fire</i>

00:59.017 --> 01:00.417
<i>compromised my co-star.</i>

01:00.451 --> 01:02.586
So, Knuckles, do you have a girlfriend?

01:02.612 --> 01:03.844
Yeah.

01:03.868 --> 01:05.483
Unfortunately...

01:05.485 --> 01:07.691
...she's a dummy.

01:07.725 --> 01:09.593
Uh... uh...

01:09.627 --> 01:12.930
The guy at the shoe repair
said he can fix Knuckles' face,

01:12.964 --> 01:14.665
but he wants 20 bucks.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.433
You could help me on my newspaper route.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.101
I need someone to protect me from dogs

01:18.136 --> 01:19.503
and some of the bigger cats.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.205
I'm holding off
for something more suited

01:21.239 --> 01:23.006
to my artistic temperament.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.542
You know, when you say things
like that, people don't like you.

01:25.577 --> 01:27.444
Hey, guys, Dad's pulling in with...

01:29.647 --> 01:31.782
He has feelings, you know!

01:31.816 --> 01:34.218
<i>In our house, Dad handled
the grocery shopping...</i>

01:34.252 --> 01:36.119
<i>20 bags, eight half-gallons of milk,</i>

01:36.154 --> 01:37.721
<i>two or three times a week.</i>

01:37.755 --> 01:39.289
<i>And if we expected to eat any of it,</i>

01:39.324 --> 01:40.624
<i>we had to help load it in.</i>

01:40.658 --> 01:42.562

01:42.596 --> 01:44.637
Let's go, people! Move! <i>Schnell!</i>

01:44.662 --> 01:48.498
These frozen pot pies...
they are ticking time bombs!

01:48.533 --> 01:50.300
I'm coming! I was in the bathroom!

01:50.335 --> 01:52.502
Oh, at last, Eddie deigns to join us.

01:52.537 --> 01:53.670
Meat first, then milk!

01:53.705 --> 01:55.672
Look at all this processed food.

01:55.707 --> 01:58.008
You know, at the seminary, we
ate more fruits and vegetables.

01:58.042 --> 01:59.676
We eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.

01:59.711 --> 02:00.811
<i>Grape</i> jelly.

02:00.845 --> 02:03.180
And every kind of potato...
chips, flakes, and tots.

02:03.214 --> 02:04.848
I mean <i>fresh</i>... food that gets to us

02:04.883 --> 02:06.750
before Dow Chemical
has their way with it.

02:06.784 --> 02:08.719
I mean, seriously, do we even
know what's in this stuff?

02:08.752 --> 02:10.086
Look, I don't know
what's in the polio vaccine.

02:10.121 --> 02:11.688
I'm still glad some of you kids got it.

02:11.723 --> 02:13.223
Your father works real hard
to pay for...

02:13.258 --> 02:16.360
$32?! Holy moly!

02:16.394 --> 02:17.761
Something might have to go back.

02:17.795 --> 02:19.363
Imitation SPAM?

02:19.397 --> 02:20.998
We don't even get real SPAM anymore?

02:21.032 --> 02:23.734
Oh, big opinions from the guy
who got to the car last.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.736
Hey, don't bury that imitation SPAM.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.904
It's on the menu for breakfast.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.205
Dad, I was actually just asking Mom

02:28.239 --> 02:30.173
about maybe adding
some produce to our diet.

02:30.208 --> 02:31.942
Ooh, then maybe you should
<i>produce</i> some money

02:31.976 --> 02:32.910
to pay for it.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.077
Rabbit food ain't cheap.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.679
Yeah, but this stuff isn't healthy.

02:35.713 --> 02:37.114
I mean, seriously, is Pat even growing?

02:37.148 --> 02:39.558
He's growing... enough.

02:39.583 --> 02:40.988
We certainly don't want him
growing any faster.

02:41.013 --> 02:42.753
He'll catch up to William before
William's done with his clothes.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.788
- Give me that.
- Fresh fruit is a crapshoot.

02:44.822 --> 02:47.457
You need to eat it right away,
when <i>they</i> tell you to.

02:47.492 --> 02:48.625
With this stuff? Ho ho!

02:48.660 --> 02:50.694
You are not my boss, broccoli.

02:50.728 --> 02:52.462
Lawrence, we're just not
fresh-vegetable people.

02:52.497 --> 02:54.598
I mean, who we trying to impress?

02:54.632 --> 02:56.400
I don't know. Our colons?

02:56.434 --> 02:58.268
There we go... my newspaper.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.469
Sorry.

02:59.504 --> 03:01.772
The Parks Department is holding
a kids' poetry contest.

03:01.806 --> 03:03.273
First prize is 25 bucks!

03:03.308 --> 03:04.741
I can get a new face for Knuckles!

03:04.776 --> 03:07.611
Knuckles! Listen to this!

03:07.645 --> 03:09.947
Can, uh, other people see Knuckles?

03:11.182 --> 03:12.883
All right.

03:12.917 --> 03:15.585
All right, buddy,
we're gonna win the prize money

03:15.620 --> 03:18.789
and score you a new face.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.791
I'm so creative.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.426
I'm a shoo-in.

03:22.460 --> 03:24.161
So many ideas.

03:24.195 --> 03:25.729
Too many.

03:25.763 --> 03:28.498
They're popping in my head,
like popcorn.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.734
Maybe I'll make some popcorn.

03:32.036 --> 03:33.570
Okay.

03:33.604 --> 03:35.005
Nature.

03:35.039 --> 03:36.707
The topic is nature.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.545
I could go outside
and look at a lamppost.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.715
Or fire hydrant.

03:46.818 --> 03:48.819
Have I ever seen nature?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.420
You're thinking too hard.

03:50.455 --> 03:52.856
Don't make a federal case
out of it, like you always do.

03:52.890 --> 03:54.658
It's like the time Aunt Alice
asked you for ideas

03:54.692 --> 03:56.793
for what to name her baby,
and you just kept saying "puppy"

03:56.828 --> 03:57.861
and then had diarrhea.

03:57.895 --> 03:58.996
The deadline is tomorrow.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.430
You can do this.

04:00.465 --> 04:01.798
I wrote plenty of poems in school.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.467
Easy peasy, lemon-squeezy.

04:03.501 --> 04:04.768
Did you just do that?!

04:04.802 --> 04:06.837
Did I just watch that happen?!

04:06.871 --> 04:08.705
You're not the only creative one
around here.

04:08.740 --> 04:12.109
A poem's much easier than some
story that has to make sense.

04:12.143 --> 04:13.810
If your poem confuses people,

04:13.845 --> 04:16.012
they just think you're deep
and they're dumb.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.214
And that's the whole point of poetry...

04:18.249 --> 04:20.183
making other people feel dumb.

04:20.218 --> 04:24.287
Ah, here it is.
My old rhyming dictionary.

04:24.322 --> 04:26.390
Yeah. Maybe it'll help.

04:26.424 --> 04:28.692
But honestly,
rhyming doesn't even matter.

04:28.726 --> 04:33.230
I'm telling you... poetry's a racket.

04:33.264 --> 04:36.333
"Mountain," "fountain"...

04:36.367 --> 04:38.635
"countin'"?

04:38.669 --> 04:40.871
Okay, you're really cutting
some corners there,

04:40.905 --> 04:41.805
rhyming dictionary.

04:41.839 --> 04:43.473
<i>And there it was...</i>

04:43.508 --> 04:46.676
<i>a poem my mom had written
in high school.</i>

04:46.711 --> 04:49.012
<i>"Ode to a Tree."</i>

04:49.047 --> 04:51.748
<i>And I knew it was really good
because it made me feel dumb.</i>

04:51.783 --> 04:53.250
<i>I was a decent enough kid</i>

04:53.284 --> 04:56.186
<i>to know that stealing her poem
was wrong.</i>

04:56.220 --> 04:57.821
<i>In retrospect, I choose to blame</i>

04:57.855 --> 04:58.789
<i>the void in moral leadership</i>

04:58.823 --> 05:01.925
<i>which defined the Nixon administration.</i>

05:01.959 --> 05:04.361
<i>A week and a half later,
and the verdict was in.</i>

05:04.395 --> 05:06.496
Frank, give it to me! It's my letter!

05:06.531 --> 05:07.931
What does it say?!

05:07.965 --> 05:09.833
It says, "To the parents
of Timmy Cleary."

05:09.867 --> 05:11.768
Thank you.

05:11.803 --> 05:12.936
"Congratulations.

05:12.970 --> 05:14.838
You won first prize."

05:14.872 --> 05:16.006
I won! I won!

05:16.040 --> 05:17.941
- I won 25 bucks!
- Let me see that.

05:17.975 --> 05:19.943
Says you'll be
receiving your prize money

05:19.977 --> 05:22.112
at a special ecology and nature fair...

05:22.146 --> 05:24.114
Oh, brother... held at Oak Park.

05:24.148 --> 05:26.950
- Nice!
- "...at which you'll read your poem aloud

05:26.984 --> 05:29.886
for assembled dignitaries,
friends, and family."

05:29.921 --> 05:32.456
- Family?
- And dignitaries.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.458
You wear the new velour shirt
I got you for your birthday.

05:34.492 --> 05:35.725
You got that for <i>me.</i>

05:35.760 --> 05:37.160
You didn't win anything. It's his now.

05:38.596 --> 05:39.963
I'm not buying it.

05:39.997 --> 05:42.966
You're no poet, and I know it.

05:44.969 --> 05:45.936
Joey.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.204
I'm in trouble.

05:47.238 --> 05:48.472
Maybe you can help me.

05:48.506 --> 05:50.273
You do a lot of bad things.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.308
I keep busy.

05:51.342 --> 05:52.709
The poem is stolen.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.111
It's something Mom wrote in high school,

05:54.145 --> 05:56.346
and she'll recognize it
the second she hears it.

05:59.016 --> 06:00.784
I guess we don't let her hear it.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.820
Crap. She already wrote it down.

06:03.855 --> 06:07.124
But, unfortunately,
she'll be a little late.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.425
Cover her eyes.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.964
That's really good!

06:13.998 --> 06:16.666
I've been turning F's
into A's since 1966.

06:16.701 --> 06:18.335
I also do Mom's signature.

06:18.369 --> 06:20.504
I've been on field trips with
schools I don't even attend.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.573
Oh, uh, didn't hear the horn, Pop.

06:23.608 --> 06:25.575
It's fine. It's just the two bags.

06:25.610 --> 06:26.810
Lawrence, get in here!

06:28.279 --> 06:29.980
I got inspired, picked up something

06:30.014 --> 06:32.015
for our eldest to shove in his mouth.

06:32.049 --> 06:33.750
Oh, look, son, a surprise...

06:33.784 --> 06:35.352
two bags of veggies and fruit.

06:35.386 --> 06:38.021
Oh, great! Now I'm gonna
have to spray for ants.

06:38.055 --> 06:40.023
Right on, Dad. You really listened.

06:40.057 --> 06:43.026
Grapes and lettuce harvested
here in California.

06:43.060 --> 06:44.361
You're welcome.

06:44.395 --> 06:46.263
You've got to be kidding me.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.431
The grape and lettuce pickers
are on strike.

06:48.466 --> 06:50.433
Haven't you heard about the boycott?

06:50.468 --> 06:52.335
I might have heard
Cronkite mention something

06:52.370 --> 06:55.272
on his nightly coverage
of whiners and crybabies.

06:55.306 --> 06:57.007
The migrant workers
are picking this stuff

06:57.041 --> 06:58.275
for mere pennies an hour.

06:58.309 --> 06:59.776
I guess that's why it's so cheap.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.311
Let's hope the bacon workers
strike next.

07:01.345 --> 07:02.846
Very funny.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.714
Well, I, for one, won't be eating any.

07:04.749 --> 07:07.017
- Seriously?
- Those are racist grapes!

07:07.051 --> 07:10.053
They are steeped in the sweat
and tears of oppression.

07:10.087 --> 07:12.856
Good! Then we don't need to wash them!

07:12.890 --> 07:14.224
Unbelievable.

07:14.258 --> 07:16.026
No gratitude.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.861
That clown is never happy.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.229
What am I supposed to do
with all this stuff?

07:19.263 --> 07:21.865
I have no idea,
but we're not wasting it.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.800
Throw it in a stew or something.

07:24.869 --> 07:25.669
Hey, this would be a good moment

07:25.703 --> 07:27.871
for Pat's lost hamster to turn up.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.406
Yeah.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.007
That's not gonna happen.

07:31.042 --> 07:32.709
<i>The day to read my poem arrived,</i>

07:32.743 --> 07:35.045
<i>and, fortunately,
Mom was thoroughly distracted.</i>

07:35.079 --> 07:38.081
Grape casserole, grape loaf...

07:38.115 --> 07:39.883
grape Suzette.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.052
- Fancy.
- Mm.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.654
♪ Don't it always seem to go ♪

07:44.689 --> 07:47.857
♪ That you don't know what
you've got till it's gone? ♪

07:47.892 --> 07:54.231
♪ They paved paradise
and put up a parking lot ♪

07:57.435 --> 07:59.669
A big thank-you to Valerie
for the singing.

07:59.704 --> 08:01.871
Valerie is my niece,
but she did have to audition.

08:03.174 --> 08:07.377
And now it's my pleasure to
introduce a very special guest.

08:07.411 --> 08:08.945
He hates pollution. We all do!

08:08.980 --> 08:10.747
Welcome, Woodsy Owl!

08:10.781 --> 08:13.283
Give a hoot!

08:13.317 --> 08:15.085
<i>Woodsy's appearance gave me a respite</i>

08:15.119 --> 08:17.020
<i>to reconsider what I was about to do.</i>

08:17.054 --> 08:18.955
<i>I hadn't done anything terrible yet.</i>

08:18.990 --> 08:21.258
<i>If I walked away now,
refused the prize money,</i>

08:21.292 --> 08:22.392
<i>didn't read the poem,</i>

08:22.426 --> 08:25.929
<i>I could go back to being
a basically decent person.</i>

08:25.963 --> 08:27.030
<i>Or...</i>

08:27.064 --> 08:28.365
- You ready, kid?
- Am I ever!

08:28.399 --> 08:30.734
And now, to recite
his prize-winning poem,

08:30.778 --> 08:33.351
our own Timmy Cleary!

08:33.398 --> 08:36.679
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

08:37.729 --> 08:40.710
"Ode to a Tree."

08:40.745 --> 08:44.381
"Your branches doth spread out,

08:44.415 --> 08:47.484
reaching like outstretched arms,

08:47.518 --> 08:49.919
welcoming morning dew..."

08:49.954 --> 08:52.989
<i>JFK, The Beatles, me.</i>

08:53.024 --> 08:55.158
<i>So few had the charisma necessary</i>

08:55.192 --> 08:57.127
<i>to mesmerize the masses.</i>

08:57.161 --> 08:58.261
<i>The audience adulation knocked the fact</i>

08:58.296 --> 09:00.964
<i>I didn't write the poem
completely out of my head.</i>

09:00.998 --> 09:03.066
<i>Was I becoming a sociopath?</i>

09:03.100 --> 09:04.334
<i>I actually prefer another word</i>

09:04.368 --> 09:06.002
<i>meaning roughly the same thing...</i>

09:06.037 --> 09:07.470
<i>a showman!</i>

09:07.505 --> 09:13.777
"At last, our willow
shall weep no more."

09:21.218 --> 09:22.419
Knuckles!

09:22.453 --> 09:23.787
Thank you!

09:35.379 --> 09:38.566
<i>She heard it.
My mom heard her stolen poem.</i>

09:38.635 --> 09:40.702
<i>Well, 12 years...</i>

09:40.762 --> 09:42.930
<i>that was a decent lifespan
in Roman times.</i>

09:42.955 --> 09:45.158
- You came.
- I almost didn't.

09:45.182 --> 09:47.450
Somehow I wrote down the wrong time.

09:47.484 --> 09:49.586
Luckily, Frank reminded me.

09:49.611 --> 09:51.423
I didn't know you had such a fondness

09:51.448 --> 09:52.782
for flowering dogwood trees,

09:52.807 --> 09:55.154
which are non-native to California.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.425
Very curious.

09:57.450 --> 09:59.693
Don't be ridiculous. He got it from me.

09:59.740 --> 10:01.122
What?

10:01.147 --> 10:02.381
Your creativity.

10:02.415 --> 10:05.183
What else would you have gotten from me?

10:05.218 --> 10:06.485
Nice poem.

10:09.155 --> 10:11.200
She's got to know I copied it, right?

10:11.225 --> 10:12.626
I knew in five seconds.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.825
You're not a big user
of the word "doth."

10:14.850 --> 10:16.363
But then why didn't she bust me?

10:16.397 --> 10:18.802
She's being really nice,
and it's freaking me out.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.496
I suppose it's possible
she doesn't remember writing it.

10:21.530 --> 10:23.998
Mom might be senile.

10:24.032 --> 10:25.233
She is really old.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.768
Mom is playing you.

10:26.802 --> 10:28.469
She enjoys tormenting us.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.004
I don't think Mom's that twisted.

10:30.038 --> 10:32.306
Oh, yeah? Remember
the mysterious basement fire

10:32.341 --> 10:34.342
we had last Christmas?

10:34.376 --> 10:36.410
The one where Knuckles lost his face.

10:36.445 --> 10:37.445
Yeah.

10:37.479 --> 10:40.592
Mom might have certain evidence
implicating me,

10:40.617 --> 10:41.623
including a bill of lading

10:41.650 --> 10:43.417
from a Mexican fireworks wholesaler,

10:43.452 --> 10:45.253
but she's never once accused me.

10:45.287 --> 10:47.522
She just keeps sighing
and saying how sad she is

10:47.556 --> 10:49.190
someone in this family can't be honest.

10:49.224 --> 10:51.325
She's waiting
for my conscience to kick in.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.193
Good luck.

10:52.227 --> 10:53.995
The best plan is to just come clean

10:54.029 --> 10:55.363
and take your punishment.

10:55.397 --> 10:58.533
- That's what I doth think.
- But what if she really doesn't know?

10:58.567 --> 11:01.169
The big win for Mom here
is getting you to confess.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.470
Then she gets to punish you,

11:02.504 --> 11:04.305
pretend you learned a valuable lesson,

11:04.339 --> 11:06.107
and feel like she's
a really good mother...

11:06.141 --> 11:08.109
the Catholic guilt trifecta.

11:08.143 --> 11:10.111
Just like Jesus taught us.

11:10.145 --> 11:11.145
Mm-hmm.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.684
- What is that?
- Waldorf salad...

11:16.718 --> 11:18.386
lettuce, grapes,
walnuts, and mayonnaise.

11:18.420 --> 11:19.887
They served it
at Tricia Nixon's wedding.

11:19.922 --> 11:21.455
If it's good enough
for the First Daughter,

11:21.490 --> 11:23.024
- it's good enough for us.
- Mm-hmm.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.393
- It tastes weird.
- What you're tasting is exploitation.

11:25.427 --> 11:27.361
Well, if that's the case,
they should bottle it

11:27.396 --> 11:29.564
because it's delicious and cheap.

11:29.598 --> 11:31.566
Hey, Timmy, I saw <i>Reader's Digest</i>

11:31.600 --> 11:33.067
was having a contest, too,

11:33.101 --> 11:36.838
judged by top poets,
like Rod McKuen and Dr. Seuss.

11:36.872 --> 11:38.239
You win this one, millions of people

11:38.273 --> 11:39.407
will see your poem...

11:39.441 --> 11:40.975
that you wrote by yourself.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.244
That's okay.

11:43.278 --> 11:45.079
I don't want any more attention.

11:45.113 --> 11:46.647
Yeah, isn't there stuff to talk about

11:46.682 --> 11:48.732
other than poems and salads?

11:48.757 --> 11:49.975
I've also been thinking about

11:50.018 --> 11:52.520
the mysterious basement fire
last Christmas.

11:52.554 --> 11:54.088
Destroyed the only photograph ever taken

11:54.122 --> 11:55.523
of my great-grandfather.

11:55.557 --> 11:56.759
My Pop-pop.

11:57.793 --> 11:59.393
He'll always be in your heart.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.998
- I'll have more salad, Dad.
- We all need to have more salad.

12:02.033 --> 12:03.900
We're not eating it fast enough.

12:03.935 --> 12:05.402
In fact, the kitchen's on lock-down

12:05.436 --> 12:07.137
till all the lettuce
and grapes get consumed.

12:07.171 --> 12:09.005
- Thank you, Lawrence.
- Yeah, thank you, Lawrence.

12:09.040 --> 12:12.509
I'm sorry that I care about
people less fortunate than us.

12:12.543 --> 12:14.444
- Wait. We're allowed to leave?
- No.

12:14.478 --> 12:16.613
Mike, you need to make
a food exception for Timmy.

12:16.647 --> 12:18.581
I baked him a cake.

12:19.984 --> 12:22.252
I know you're not supposed to
have a favorite child,

12:22.286 --> 12:25.588
but when one is <i>this</i> creative,
who we kidding?

12:25.623 --> 12:27.424
I'll probably just e-eat it later.

12:27.458 --> 12:30.593
- Absolutely outstanding, Peg.
- Aww.

12:30.628 --> 12:32.762
You don't think
of putting mayo on a grape,

12:32.797 --> 12:34.497
- but here it is...
- Mm.

12:34.532 --> 12:37.600
...a winning combination.

12:37.635 --> 12:38.468
Mmm.

12:41.138 --> 12:43.173
Something is very wrong, Joey.

12:43.207 --> 12:45.375
It's chocolate, my all-time favorite,

12:45.409 --> 12:49.012
and I feel so guilty,
it just tastes bitter.

12:49.046 --> 12:50.680
That's because Mom
didn't put any sugar in it.

12:50.715 --> 12:51.815
She's messing with you.

12:51.849 --> 12:54.551
She wants you to think you can
no longer experience joy.

12:54.585 --> 12:55.485
Are you serious?

12:55.519 --> 12:57.120
You should have tasted
the guilt meringue pie

12:57.154 --> 12:58.555
she baked for me
after the basement fire.

12:58.589 --> 13:00.023
That means she absolutely knows.

13:00.057 --> 13:02.125
Like I'm saying,
now you just wait her out,

13:02.159 --> 13:03.193
and you can win this thing.

13:03.227 --> 13:05.962
Joey, I'm not built like you.
I have a conscience.

13:05.997 --> 13:07.897
A disadvantage, but I believe in you.

13:07.932 --> 13:11.067
No! I-I've got to admit to her
I stole the poem!

13:11.102 --> 13:12.569
Of course you did,

13:12.603 --> 13:15.505
and I found where you stole it
from, you little crook.

13:15.539 --> 13:19.476
I camped out in the library,
and look what I found...

13:19.510 --> 13:23.580
"Ode to a Dogwood Tree," 1914,
by David Langford Lawless.

13:23.614 --> 13:27.584
Everyone made fun of me for
laminating my library card...

13:27.618 --> 13:29.886
but this is the ticket to secrets.

13:42.599 --> 13:44.032
Whatcha doin', Mom?

13:44.060 --> 13:47.508
Oh, just a new outfit for Knuckles.

13:47.533 --> 13:49.067
That's really nice of you.

13:49.101 --> 13:52.904
We all express our creativity
according to our own gifts.

13:52.938 --> 13:55.507
My mom taught me to sew.

13:55.541 --> 13:58.743
It's still making something
out of nothing, but...

13:58.778 --> 14:01.746
'course, it's not at the level
of your literary achievement.

14:01.781 --> 14:04.282
But how could I even dream
of ever writing a poem

14:04.316 --> 14:06.785
as good as yours?

14:06.819 --> 14:08.787
I keep thinking
maybe Knuckles has a secret

14:08.821 --> 14:10.255
he wants to tell me.

14:12.358 --> 14:15.460
If I hold him up to my ear...

14:15.494 --> 14:17.962
maybe he'll whisper it to me.

14:17.997 --> 14:19.264
He's a doll, Mom.

14:20.399 --> 14:22.300
I know.

14:22.334 --> 14:23.334
I just thought...

14:23.369 --> 14:26.805
sometimes it's easier
to say things that way.

14:26.839 --> 14:28.840
There <i>is</i> something I wanted to tell you.

14:31.811 --> 14:33.311
Okay, then.

14:33.345 --> 14:36.014
- About the contest.
- Mm.

14:36.048 --> 14:38.016
The <i>Reader's Digest contest...</i>

14:38.050 --> 14:39.918
I want to enter it.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.456
All that's left
is your signature as my parent,

14:44.490 --> 14:46.458
swearing that I am the author,

14:46.492 --> 14:48.960
legally binding
under penalty of perjury...

14:51.163 --> 14:52.964
...and in the sight of God.

14:56.168 --> 14:58.002
You sure you want to do this?

14:58.037 --> 14:59.337
Oh, absolutely.

14:59.371 --> 15:01.639
I want more people to read the poem...

15:01.674 --> 15:03.408
even people in Wisconsin,

15:03.442 --> 15:06.010
birthplace of David Langford Lawless.

15:07.179 --> 15:09.347
But compared to his poetic genius,

15:09.381 --> 15:12.050
I'd only give myself...

15:12.084 --> 15:13.384
an A-minus.

15:14.887 --> 15:16.054
<i>And that was it.</i>

15:16.088 --> 15:17.922
<i>Mom knew that I knew she stole it,</i>

15:17.957 --> 15:19.858
<i>and I knew she knew that I knew.</i>

15:19.892 --> 15:21.860
<i>But neither one of us
could bust the other</i>

15:21.894 --> 15:23.661
<i>without admitting their own guilt.</i>

15:23.696 --> 15:25.163
<i>This was crazy!</i>

15:25.197 --> 15:26.865
<i>If</i> Reader's Digest <i>printed the poem,</i>

15:26.899 --> 15:28.767
<i>we would both be exposed as frauds.</i>

15:28.801 --> 15:30.735
<i>But Mom was not only willing
to risk humiliation,</i>

15:30.770 --> 15:33.104
<i>she was willing
to waste a six-cent stamp.</i>

15:38.277 --> 15:39.744
Well...

15:39.779 --> 15:41.679
we should mail this.

15:41.714 --> 15:44.449
If we hurry, we can make it
to the box for the last pickup.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.924
<i>It was poetry-contest chicken,</i>

15:52.958 --> 15:55.426
<i>each of us refusing to blink.</i>

16:09.946 --> 16:12.277
- Well, that's that.
- Yes, it is.

16:12.311 --> 16:14.112
<i>I realized then that my mom and I</i>

16:14.146 --> 16:16.047
<i>were more alike than I'd ever thought,</i>

16:16.081 --> 16:18.316
<i>both sharing the same self-destructive,</i>

16:18.350 --> 16:20.118
<i>stubborn streak.</i>

16:20.152 --> 16:23.054
<i>And I suddenly felt very close with her.</i>

16:31.864 --> 16:33.064
I'll take that bologna.

16:33.098 --> 16:34.399
Oh, hey.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.000
I wasn't gonna eat that.

16:36.035 --> 16:37.802
It was just in the way

16:37.837 --> 16:40.104
as I was reaching for more salad.

16:40.139 --> 16:42.106
I really developed a taste for this.

16:42.141 --> 16:43.107
Great.

16:43.142 --> 16:44.843
Have a seat.

16:51.350 --> 16:52.383
Enjoy.

17:02.795 --> 17:04.095
Mmm.

17:04.128 --> 17:07.965
It's all kind of slippery now.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.032
Slides right down.

17:11.971 --> 17:13.338
Hi.

17:13.372 --> 17:15.006
Hello.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.008
How was your dinner out?

17:17.041 --> 17:18.142
Met some friends,

17:18.176 --> 17:21.479
ate, uh, a lovely meal
at a... at a vegetarian place.

17:21.512 --> 17:24.147
Who are these friends...
a rabbit, a turtle, and a bird?

17:24.183 --> 17:26.117
It was actually really tasty,

17:26.151 --> 17:28.620
although I was starving again by
the time I hit the parking lot.

17:28.654 --> 17:31.155
- You can have most of this.
- Oh, no, that's all yours.

17:31.190 --> 17:33.691
Eat up. That mayonnaise
isn't getting any younger.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.294
Have a slice.

17:40.199 --> 17:41.232
- Thank you.
- Oh, see?

17:41.267 --> 17:44.302
That wasn't so hard, a "thank you."

17:44.336 --> 17:46.304
Where was that when I picked up
the lettuce and the grapes?

17:46.338 --> 17:47.739
I guess I was taken aback

17:47.773 --> 17:50.074
that you didn't care
about the farm workers.

17:50.109 --> 17:51.476
I mean, you say you admire hard work,

17:51.510 --> 17:53.678
but somehow that doesn't seem to apply

17:53.712 --> 17:56.748
with people of any shade darker than...

17:56.782 --> 17:58.883
No. This isn't about color.

17:58.918 --> 18:00.151
You said you wanted produce.

18:00.185 --> 18:02.086
I saw a good price, and I jumped at it.

18:02.121 --> 18:03.221
I don't care if the guy who picked it

18:03.255 --> 18:06.724
is as white as that mayonnaise or...

18:06.759 --> 18:09.260
brown as that other mayonnaise
on the edge there.

18:09.295 --> 18:10.728
You can eat around that, son.

18:10.763 --> 18:12.931
You just enjoy a good bargain?

18:12.965 --> 18:15.199
I like providing for my family

18:15.234 --> 18:16.301
and nobody going to bed hungry.

18:16.335 --> 18:18.202
I'd give anything to go to bed hungry.

18:18.237 --> 18:21.172
Dad, nobody's going to bed
hungry in this house.

18:21.206 --> 18:22.840
It's not something any of us
have to worry about.

18:22.875 --> 18:25.043
Because <i>I</i> worry about it...

18:25.077 --> 18:28.179
every day and every single night
since that morning in 1952

18:28.213 --> 18:30.581
when I walked into that room
in St. Vincent's Hospital

18:30.616 --> 18:32.350
and met my firstborn son,

18:32.384 --> 18:35.186
premature and needing
all sorts of expensive medicine.

18:36.822 --> 18:38.356
That was a long time ago.

18:38.390 --> 18:40.024
You're not struggling now.

18:40.059 --> 18:41.392
I mean, nothing's gonna happen.

18:41.427 --> 18:43.461
Sure.

18:43.495 --> 18:45.430
Probably.

18:45.464 --> 18:48.533
But a man can't just turn off the worry.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.201
You'll see someday,
when it's your responsibility

18:50.235 --> 18:52.370
to fill that box up three times a week.

18:54.173 --> 18:57.141
I've been where your farm worker
fella has been.

19:00.612 --> 19:04.048
I feel like I should apologize
for calling you a racist.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.817
Up to me, your friends Paco and Pablo

19:05.851 --> 19:07.285
would get every peso they're worth.

19:07.319 --> 19:08.920
And then you say stuff like that.

19:08.954 --> 19:10.054
All right, how about this?

19:10.089 --> 19:14.325
I promise, no more green food
in this house again...

19:14.360 --> 19:17.161
once Eddie finishes that.

19:17.196 --> 19:18.429
Yum.

19:21.834 --> 19:23.067
So, what do we got here?

19:29.341 --> 19:31.442
<i>Knuckles got his new face and threads,</i>

19:31.477 --> 19:33.277
<i>and we got back on the party circuit.</i>

19:33.312 --> 19:35.646
<i>I even updated my act
with topical references.</i>

19:35.681 --> 19:37.682
So, Knuckles, why did the lifeguard

19:37.716 --> 19:39.917
not save the drowning hippie?

19:39.952 --> 19:42.253
Because he was too...

19:42.287 --> 19:44.155
far out, man.

19:44.189 --> 19:45.790
<i>Weeks passed.</i>

19:45.824 --> 19:48.092
<i>Mom and I didn't speak
of the poem again, until...</i>

19:48.127 --> 19:49.260
Mail's here.

19:49.294 --> 19:50.328
This came from <i>Reader's Digest.</i>

19:50.362 --> 19:52.363
<i>Our only hope
for not being publicly shamed</i>

19:52.398 --> 19:53.865
<i>was losing that contest.</i>

19:53.899 --> 19:55.099
- Crap.
- Darn it.

19:55.134 --> 19:56.467
<i>And yet when it happened,</i>

19:56.502 --> 19:58.269
<i>we were both strangely disappointed.</i>

19:58.303 --> 20:00.438
This makes no sense.
That poem is wonderful.

20:00.472 --> 20:01.939
Yeah, but Timmy didn't write it.

20:01.974 --> 20:03.641
Oh, be quiet. You wouldn't understand.

20:03.675 --> 20:05.810
Yeah. You're not creative,
like me and Mom.

20:05.844 --> 20:07.011
Timmy's not creative.

20:07.046 --> 20:09.380
- Oh, really, Frank? Where's <i>your</i> poem?
- Yeah, Frank.

20:09.415 --> 20:11.282
Where's his? I can show you in a book.

20:11.316 --> 20:13.651
Oh, books!
I once read a book about dragons.

20:13.685 --> 20:16.054
They don't exist.
You know, these poetry big shots

20:16.088 --> 20:17.555
are always threatened by fresh talent.

20:17.589 --> 20:20.625
Fresh? The guy wrote it in 1914.

20:20.659 --> 20:22.060
Who are these people to judge us?

20:22.094 --> 20:23.194
They're the judges.

20:23.228 --> 20:24.629
Wait. There's something else.

20:24.663 --> 20:26.831
"Dear poet, your poem was super groovy.

20:26.865 --> 20:28.466
You have lots of potential,
which will only get better

20:28.500 --> 20:31.035
as you work at it, so keep on truckin'.

20:31.070 --> 20:32.804
Peace and love. Rod."

20:32.838 --> 20:35.306
Rod McKuen sees potential.

20:35.340 --> 20:37.208
I know I act like a cool customer,

20:37.242 --> 20:38.576
but it is nice to get encouragement

20:38.610 --> 20:40.144
from a fellow poet.

20:40.179 --> 20:42.413
Nobody in this room is a poet.

20:42.448 --> 20:44.482
Mr. Rod McKuen disagrees.

20:44.516 --> 20:45.483
Thank you, Timmy.

20:48.620 --> 20:50.388
Rod McKuen.

20:50.422 --> 20:53.224
<i>My mom and I together had
committed the perfect crime.</i>

20:53.258 --> 20:57.028
<i>We stole a poem and somehow
convinced ourselves we hadn't.</i>

20:57.062 --> 20:58.830
That might be why she cherished
<i>that letter so much.</i>

20:58.864 --> 21:02.200
<i>It connected us
in a true act of creativity...</i>

21:02.234 --> 21:03.701
reinventing a frustrating world

21:03.735 --> 21:06.404
<i>and insisting that others play along.</i>

21:06.438 --> 21:08.506
<i>My mom taught me that a small amount</i>

21:08.540 --> 21:11.242
<i>of cheerful self-delusion
is sometimes necessary</i>

21:11.276 --> 21:14.846
<i>in nurturing a gentle and artistic soul.</i>

21:14.880 --> 21:16.305
<i>Keep on truckin', Peggy.</i>

21:19.102 --> 21:21.182
Joey, be a dear and run down

21:21.207 --> 21:23.026
and get me that bolt
of dark green corduroy

21:23.051 --> 21:24.973
- from the basement, hmm?
- Sure, Mom.

21:25.007 --> 21:26.530
Ah, wait.

21:26.555 --> 21:27.576
Darn it all.

21:27.610 --> 21:29.177
That fabric got destroyed

21:29.212 --> 21:31.179
in the mysterious basement fire.

21:31.214 --> 21:32.881
- That's too bad.
- Mm.

21:32.915 --> 21:35.550
That corduroy was very special to me.

21:35.585 --> 21:36.885
The same fabric as the dress I wore

21:36.919 --> 21:38.687
to my grandmother's funeral,

21:38.721 --> 21:39.888
God rest her soul.

21:40.923 --> 21:42.390
You win some, you lose some.

21:45.728 --> 21:47.462
That kid's going places.
