{\an8}Previously on
"Floribama Shore"...

00:06.072 --> 00:08.208
{\an8}In the end, I'm always
gonna be there for you.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.976
{\an8}I think he's starting
to like you,

00:10.043 --> 00:12.112
{\an8}'cause he's very
protective over you,

00:12.178 --> 00:15.048
{\an8}and he's not like that about
any of the rest of the girls.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.384
{\an8}Okay, of course right now
I feelings for Jeremiah.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.953
{\an9}I love you.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.953
{\an8}I love you too.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.955
{\an8}If you wanna come snuggle
with me, you can.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.356
{\an7}I just don't wanna get
your hopes up

00:23.423 --> 00:25.291
{\an8}because I know
I'm closed off.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.360
{\an8}He's told me multiple times,
like, "Are you sure?

00:27.427 --> 00:29.562
{\an8}"I don't wanna hurt you,
I don't want you to feel bad

00:29.629 --> 00:31.664
{\an8}about this," and it makes me,
like, want him more.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.736

myself into?

01:14.574 --> 01:17.243
Two adults can do
whatever they want,

01:17.310 --> 01:19.646
because they're adults,
and we're young,

01:19.712 --> 01:21.247
and we're fun,
and we're cute.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.716
And in return, I look like
I was (bleep) attacked

01:23.783 --> 01:25.351

01:25.418 --> 01:27.821
So, yeah.

01:27.887 --> 01:30.056
{\an1}(Kortni)
I saw you, bitch.

01:30.123 --> 01:33.026
And I heard him
smack that ass.

01:33.092 --> 01:36.129
You think I can
go to work like this?

01:36.196 --> 01:38.264
Why'd he do that?

01:38.331 --> 01:40.233
I don't (bleep) know,
but I'm gonna beat him up

01:40.300 --> 01:41.534
whenever he wakes up.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.936
Did he (bleep) the cat?

01:43.002 --> 01:44.804
{\an3}No.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.804
{\an1}Damn.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.005
I don't think he does that.

01:46.072 --> 01:49.776
{\an1}Looks like he marked
his territory, ya bitch.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.979
{\an8}Normally when you have a friends
with benefits situation going on

01:53.046 --> 01:54.280
{\an8}you don't live with 'em.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.756
I just (bleep)
where I sleep, literally.

02:03.823 --> 02:06.392

It's you, me, and Kortni.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.076
(Gus)
Well, I tried my best.

02:23.142 --> 02:24.978
You know, I made it this far.

02:25.044 --> 02:27.213
I went days,
I went weeks.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.849
It is what it is.
Nothing's changed for me.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.085
I mean, if we go out,
we drink a little bit,

02:32.151 --> 02:34.487
we have fun, and we end up
doing the same thing,

02:34.554 --> 02:35.889
then we do the same thing.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.258
But I hope it doesn't lead--
end up hurting her.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.994

02:43.263 --> 02:46.099
Me and Candace
were laying in bed,

02:46.165 --> 02:50.103
and then Nilsa comes in there
and she's just laying with him.

02:50.169 --> 02:53.506
Okay, and they're laying down,
and all I heard is, bam!

02:53.573 --> 02:55.008
They-- they were having
to tell me and Candace

02:55.074 --> 02:56.409

What the (bleep) happened
last night?

03:07.353 --> 03:09.989
Gus hunched Nilsa?

03:10.056 --> 03:11.357
{\an3}Yeah!

03:11.424 --> 03:13.159
{\an1}At least you're getting it
out of your system, brother.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.863
{\an1}(laughing)
It had to happen eventually.

03:16.930 --> 03:20.600

{\an1}(Jeremiah)
Savagery.

03:28.107 --> 03:30.777
{\an8}I was trying my best
to make this not happen.

03:30.843 --> 03:34.047
But I'm a man and I'm weak.
I'm too weak.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.884

Hold on, first of all,
look at Nilsa's neck.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.700
Look at her neck.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.135
What happened?

04:29.202 --> 04:31.638
I got injured
last night.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.178

to tell you things

13:34.113 --> 13:35.781
{\an1}that I don't tell
other people

13:35.848 --> 13:37.383

to know that.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.286

It's hurtful whenever
Jeremiah's like,

13:42.321 --> 13:44.957

risking a friendship,

15:32.631 --> 15:34.233
You know, I was for
Gus and Nilsa at first

15:34.300 --> 15:35.868
'cause I just wanted people
in the house to hook up.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.136
And now that I already seen it,

15:37.202 --> 15:39.371
I'm just seeing
that it's not gonna go nowhere.

just kinda hitting

15:41.040 --> 15:42.374
and going on about his way.

15:42.441 --> 15:46.145
And Nilsa is slowly starting
to catch some feelings,

15:46.211 --> 15:47.980
even though she claiming
that she not.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.015
So, they don't need to do this.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.117

feel some type of way

{\an1}No.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.288
{\an3}Not at all?

15:56.355 --> 15:58.123

15:56.355 --> 15:58.123
{\an3}Okay.
