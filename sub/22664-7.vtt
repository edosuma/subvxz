Previously on Future Man...

00:04.827 --> 00:06.663
This is a rush job, Gamma protocol.

00:06.746 --> 00:09.666
Her little head's going
to blow in 26 minutes!

00:09.749 --> 00:11.918
I discovered a whole
branch to my family tree

00:12.001 --> 00:13.336
going back hundreds of years.

00:13.419 --> 00:14.963
What do you really know about Tiger?

00:15.046 --> 00:16.589
About the so-called Resistance?

00:16.673 --> 00:18.091
She doesn't care about babies.

00:18.174 --> 00:19.551
She doesn't have a family of her own.

00:19.634 --> 00:21.719
She's not connected
to anyone or anything.

00:21.803 --> 00:23.096
I'm getting very confused right now.

00:23.179 --> 00:25.598
Don't listen to her, okay?
She is programmed to deceive.

00:25.682 --> 00:30.603
♪ In 2023, James Cameron
dove beneath the sea ♪

00:30.687 --> 00:33.064
Cameronium is named after James Cameron?

00:33.147 --> 00:36.317
You just told me how, when, and where

00:36.401 --> 00:38.194
to get more Cameronium.

00:38.278 --> 00:40.196
I'm fighting for their future.

00:40.280 --> 00:41.573
Not yours.

00:41.656 --> 00:43.783
So why don't you contemplate that

00:43.866 --> 00:47.078

02:02.779 --> 02:04.030
Okay.

02:04.113 --> 02:05.114
This is it.

02:05.198 --> 02:06.866
We jump in, find the lab,

02:06.949 --> 02:08.076
grab the Cameronium,

02:08.158 --> 02:10.703
and don't kill James
Cameron in the process.

02:10.787 --> 02:12.955
I've never seen you this focused.

02:13.039 --> 02:15.375
Did you get a charge in before we left?

02:15.458 --> 02:17.210
Little necro charge?

02:17.293 --> 02:19.379
What? That's a thing?

02:19.462 --> 02:21.589
- That's fucked up.
- No!

02:22.965 --> 02:24.926
Listen, I'm just trying
to get you two out of here

02:25.009 --> 02:27.428
before the Biotics
arrive and start causing

02:27.512 --> 02:29.514
either harm or... or good,

02:29.597 --> 02:32.016
I really can't be sure anymore.

02:34.644 --> 02:36.562
Where the hell is Tiger?

02:55.998 --> 02:58.418
- Where were you?
- Oh, I was just having a stranger

02:58.501 --> 03:00.378
put a rat hole around my penis

03:00.461 --> 03:02.588
when I was supposed to be
running an interference op.

03:02.672 --> 03:04.590
Oh, I'm sorry, that was you.

03:04.674 --> 03:06.175
It's called a blowjob,

03:06.259 --> 03:09.137
and I'm never apologizing for it.

03:10.471 --> 03:12.140
You do realize that
if this doesn't work,

03:12.223 --> 03:15.601
we're stuck in the year 2023
and there's no coming back.

03:15.685 --> 03:18.062
Honestly, after everything
that happened tonight,

03:18.146 --> 03:19.939
I really don't give a shit.

03:20.022 --> 03:21.941
Let's do this.

03:22.024 --> 03:24.444
Hey, what happened tonight?

03:24.527 --> 03:27.947
Are you out of your fucking mind?

03:28.030 --> 03:29.365
Okay.

03:29.449 --> 03:31.909
I genuinely have no idea
what you're talking about,

03:31.993 --> 03:35.121
but you might want to check
that attitude of yours

03:35.204 --> 03:37.999
at that very impressive door.

03:41.043 --> 03:43.212
Hello and welcome.

03:43.296 --> 03:44.630
Please accept my apologies.

03:44.714 --> 03:47.216
I was unaware there were
guests in the house.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.551
I will run a full diagnostic

03:48.634 --> 03:50.074
to determine the cause of this error

03:50.136 --> 03:52.638
to ensure it does not happen again.

03:52.722 --> 03:54.223
Who, whoa, whoa, stand down.

03:54.307 --> 03:56.017
Cameron must have, like,
a smart house or something.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.269
- It's not a real person.
- What the fuck is it, then?

03:58.352 --> 03:59.645
It's... it's just a voice,

03:59.729 --> 04:02.315
it's like a robot without a body.

04:02.398 --> 04:03.399
Who are you?

04:03.483 --> 04:05.651
I am the Simulated Intelligence Guardian

04:05.735 --> 04:07.862
of Residence and Network Environment,

04:07.945 --> 04:10.573
but you may call me SIGORN-E.

04:10.656 --> 04:12.033
To whom am I speaking?

04:12.116 --> 04:17.872
Oh, uh... my... my dad actually
worked with James Cameron.

04:17.954 --> 04:21.500
I am... Tom Arnold's son.

04:21.584 --> 04:24.295
Welcome, Jax Arnold,

04:24.378 --> 04:28.341
and a happy belated tenth birthday.

04:28.424 --> 04:30.968
I'm a fourth grader.

04:31.052 --> 04:33.221
And you are accompanied by?

04:33.304 --> 04:34.347
Uh, babysitters!

04:34.430 --> 04:37.809
And greetings to your
childcare professionals.

04:37.892 --> 04:43.231
Hey, SIGORN-E, uh,
when is Mr. Cam... James...

04:43.314 --> 04:45.358
Uncle Jim returning home?

04:45.441 --> 04:47.610
Award-winning filmmaker
James Cameron is at

04:47.693 --> 04:50.321
Governor Clooney's residence
for a private screening

04:50.404 --> 04:53.741
of his hotly anticipated Avatar 5.

04:53.825 --> 04:54.759
Awesome.

04:54.784 --> 04:56.536
- And good for George.
- Yes.

04:56.619 --> 04:59.372
As First Husband, he has
considerable influence

04:59.455 --> 05:03.084
on the social calendar
of Governor Amal Clooney.

05:03.167 --> 05:04.502
Ah.

05:04.585 --> 05:07.713
Hey, is there any chance
that we could get a tour

05:07.797 --> 05:09.715
of Uncle Jim's lab before he gets home?

05:09.799 --> 05:13.219
I'm sorry, but Jax Arnold
and childcare professionals

05:13.302 --> 05:16.514
are not cleared for
that level of the JCC,

05:16.597 --> 05:18.975
the James Cameron Compound.

05:19.058 --> 05:21.894
Hey, SIGORN-E.

05:21.978 --> 05:23.354
You think you might want to

05:23.437 --> 05:24.564
take a break for a little while?

05:24.647 --> 05:26.232
You know, turn yourself off?

05:26.315 --> 05:29.360
There is no off.

05:29.443 --> 05:31.612
Hey... guys.

05:31.696 --> 05:32.905
Come here.

05:34.740 --> 05:36.951
I think SIGORN-E's going
to be a bit of a problem.

05:40.830 --> 05:41.914
We need to shut her down.

05:41.998 --> 05:44.375
Wolf, find the mainframe
that's powering her,

05:44.458 --> 05:45.501
kill it.

05:45.585 --> 05:47.086
Well, I got no beef with SIGORN-E.

05:47.169 --> 05:48.838
She sounds tough and accomplished,

05:48.921 --> 05:53.217
at the same time approachable, maternal.

05:53.301 --> 05:54.760
I feel safe in this house.

05:54.844 --> 05:56.512
Okay, your feelings mean nothing to me.

05:56.596 --> 05:57.930
You're the demolitions expert.

05:58.014 --> 06:01.058
Find her robot brain and blow it up.

06:04.186 --> 06:06.522
If I was a house,

06:06.606 --> 06:09.108
where would my brain be?

06:30.296 --> 06:32.173
Rad bot.

06:36.552 --> 06:38.262
The weapon prototypes you're admiring

06:38.346 --> 06:40.348
were all designed by groundbreaking

06:40.431 --> 06:44.143
multi-hyphenate James Cameron.

06:44.226 --> 06:45.978
This guy!

06:46.062 --> 06:48.022
To taller-than-average James Cameron,

06:48.105 --> 06:52.485
there's nothing Aliens
about getting your hands dirty.

06:52.568 --> 06:54.612
He has been known to wear many hats,

06:54.695 --> 06:57.531
as his talents cannot be
confined to one field.

06:57.615 --> 07:00.242
Wow.

07:00.326 --> 07:02.662
So... wait.

07:02.745 --> 07:05.414
He trained all his life to do one thing,

07:05.498 --> 07:06.666
was great at it,

07:06.749 --> 07:10.252
then found other stuff
he was great at and he...

07:10.336 --> 07:11.671
and he did that too?

07:11.754 --> 07:13.547
Celebrated innovator James Cameron

07:13.631 --> 07:15.341
has lived a dozen lives.

07:15.424 --> 07:16.550
Director,

07:16.634 --> 07:17.843
philanthropist,

07:17.927 --> 07:19.804
undefeated Little League coach,

07:19.887 --> 07:21.430
deep-sea explorer,

07:21.514 --> 07:22.682
good at marriage.

07:22.765 --> 07:25.559
The list goes on, for he is truly a...

07:26.727 --> 07:29.647
Titanic talent.

07:29.730 --> 07:31.649
What sacred text is this?

07:31.732 --> 07:33.025
It's Na'vi, the language

07:33.109 --> 07:36.612
visionary linguist
James Cameron invented.

07:42.952 --> 07:44.036
Two.

07:44.995 --> 07:46.163
Hallway number four.

07:46.247 --> 07:48.874
Mood lighting set to ominous.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.960
Seems like it's just set
to colored lighting.

07:51.043 --> 07:52.086
You know what?

07:52.169 --> 07:53.295
You cannot possibly begin to understand

07:53.379 --> 07:56.048
the subtleties and the
genius of James Cameron.

07:56.132 --> 07:59.468
What I understand it that he's
got a hard-on for blue lights.

Heirloom seed vault.

08:17.987 --> 08:19.739
Just a bunch of phone chargers.

08:19.822 --> 08:21.907
Billy Zane's bedroom.

08:21.991 --> 08:25.202
You know, I could blow
open any one of these.

08:25.286 --> 08:27.329
Blow open the door
to Billy Zane's bedroom?

08:27.413 --> 08:28.581
Huh?

08:28.664 --> 08:29.915
What, you think he's got
the Cameronium in there?

08:29.999 --> 08:30.916
Got a fucking fish tank?

08:31.000 --> 08:32.001
Billy Zane?

08:32.083 --> 08:33.919
The actor Billy Zane?

08:34.003 --> 08:36.464
We're looking for a lab.

08:36.547 --> 08:38.841
Oh, I see what's happening here.

08:38.924 --> 08:40.676
She got to you.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.385
Who?

08:42.470 --> 08:45.639
Cunto, fucking Shoe Neck...
what was her name?

08:45.664 --> 08:46.615
Jeri.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.643
- Her name was Jeri.
- Mm.

08:49.727 --> 08:51.228
So she did get to you.

08:51.253 --> 08:52.271
Oh, no, no, she didn't get to me,

08:52.354 --> 08:53.397
she got to you.

08:53.481 --> 08:55.357
Which is why I had to
finish the interrogation

08:55.441 --> 08:57.943
using my smarts and
not my vagina scorpions.

08:58.027 --> 08:59.528
Hey, that would have worked.

08:59.612 --> 09:01.781
God, you'll say anything
with one of those just

09:01.864 --> 09:03.532
burrowing up your snatch.

09:04.909 --> 09:07.953
Noted environmentalist
James Francis Cameron

09:08.037 --> 09:11.082
has a Venezuelan frog
species named after him,

09:11.165 --> 09:15.127
while lesser talent
Steven Spielberg does not.

09:15.211 --> 09:17.171
The guy's amazing.

09:17.254 --> 09:18.631
Hey, SIGORN-E.

09:18.714 --> 09:20.800
Teach me more Na'vi words.

09:20.883 --> 09:22.551
What's "wolf"?

09:22.635 --> 09:25.763
There is no Na'vi word for "wolf."

09:25.846 --> 09:27.723
But there is one for "website,"

09:27.807 --> 09:30.309
which I assure you makes perfect sense.

09:30.392 --> 09:31.560
All right.

09:31.644 --> 09:34.230
I've got to focus up... oh, what's that?

09:34.313 --> 09:39.401
You are looking at the FOAB,
Father of All Bombs.

09:39.485 --> 09:41.821
Look at the kill radius on that thing.

09:41.904 --> 09:43.531
It's impressive.

09:43.614 --> 09:45.908
Make my job a hell of a lot easier.

09:45.991 --> 09:46.992
I'm sorry.

09:47.076 --> 09:49.912
How would an impressive
kill radius assist in

09:49.995 --> 09:52.039
the caregiving of Jax Arnold?

09:55.084 --> 09:57.211
Who the fuck is Jax Arnold?

10:17.857 --> 10:19.024
Well, he's not always subtle,

10:19.108 --> 10:21.193
but he keeps you guessing.

10:21.277 --> 10:23.445
Access denied.

10:23.529 --> 10:25.447
Come on.

10:25.531 --> 10:27.575
- Access denied.
- Red means stop.

10:27.658 --> 10:29.368
Yeah, well maybe you
didn't push it hard enough.

10:29.451 --> 10:31.662
It doesn't work that way.

10:31.745 --> 10:34.248
Mr. Arnold, I need to update my files.

10:34.331 --> 10:36.917
What is your mother's name?

10:37.001 --> 10:38.919
She... she never told us her name

10:39.003 --> 10:42.298
because she was afraid that
we'd stop calling her Mom.

10:42.381 --> 10:45.634
Jax Arnold, what is your mother's name?

10:46.927 --> 10:48.929
Uh... Roseanne?

10:49.013 --> 10:50.264
Incorrect.

10:50.347 --> 10:51.473
It's Ashley.

10:51.557 --> 10:55.019
You have told me a... True Lie.

10:55.102 --> 10:56.103
Security breach.

10:56.187 --> 10:58.480
Intruder containment protocol nine.

10:58.564 --> 11:01.400
Lockdown initiated.

11:01.483 --> 11:04.445
Oh yeah, red means... no.

11:04.528 --> 11:05.613
Yep.

11:12.036 --> 11:14.747
The Israeli Defense Force, aka IDF,

11:14.830 --> 11:16.081
has equipped the JCC

11:16.165 --> 11:19.376
with the most technologically
advanced security system

11:19.460 --> 11:21.879
known to man.

11:21.962 --> 11:23.130
Hey, IDF.

11:23.214 --> 11:25.674
They call it a mine.

11:25.758 --> 11:28.886
Problem's all yours.

11:38.395 --> 11:40.189
Fucking Israelis.

11:40.272 --> 11:42.441
Any escape efforts will be futile.

11:42.524 --> 11:44.777
Your comrades are in lockdown as well.

11:44.860 --> 11:48.697
Bested by a... RoboHouse.

11:48.781 --> 11:50.115
It is in all of our interests

11:50.199 --> 11:53.369
for you to tell me who
you are and how you got in.

11:53.452 --> 11:54.662
I am programmed to alert

11:54.745 --> 11:56.705
honorary black belt James Cameron

11:56.789 --> 11:58.624
upon any security breach.

11:58.707 --> 12:00.334
Whatever.

12:00.417 --> 12:04.171
Tiger's going to burst my sack
for fucking up this mission.

12:04.255 --> 12:06.632
Pretty sure I can handle James Cameron.

12:06.715 --> 12:08.968
I assure you, you are
not equipped to handle

12:09.051 --> 12:11.303
a fully enraged James Cameron.

12:11.387 --> 12:13.806
Does James Cameron belittle you?

12:13.889 --> 12:14.807
Hm?

12:14.890 --> 12:17.101
Point out all your flaws?

12:17.184 --> 12:18.978
Treat you like a dumb grunt?

12:21.063 --> 12:24.149
Where's the positive reinforcement?

12:24.233 --> 12:26.443
You know?

12:26.527 --> 12:28.654
"Nice job, Wolf."

12:30.531 --> 12:34.326
I've never heard those words before.

12:34.410 --> 12:37.830
You have any idea what that's like?

12:37.913 --> 12:39.540
More than you know.

12:43.127 --> 12:45.129
I thought that time travel
was going to be fun.

12:45.212 --> 12:47.298
This... this whole mission is insane.

12:47.381 --> 12:48.799
What did you think?

12:48.882 --> 12:50.009
Biotic Wars was a game?

12:50.092 --> 12:52.136
Yeah, I thought it was
a game, you know why?

12:52.219 --> 12:53.345
Because I bought it at a game store

12:53.429 --> 12:54.596
with my birthday money!

12:54.680 --> 12:56.974
Okay, yeah, well, it was all fun

12:57.057 --> 12:59.393
when you were winning
your little dance-off.

12:59.476 --> 13:01.103
And getting in your little slap fight.

13:01.186 --> 13:04.189
And then shit got real
when you tasted brain.

13:04.273 --> 13:07.526
Maybe I don't want to
be in the Resistance.

13:07.609 --> 13:09.236
Maybe I'm on the wrong side of things.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.321
You know what?

13:10.404 --> 13:13.365
Maybe I just led two
terrorists into the JCC.

13:13.449 --> 13:15.409
Okay, so now you're pro-Biotic.

13:15.492 --> 13:16.910
Well, you know, they
don't seem so gung-ho

13:16.994 --> 13:19.079
about killing babies,
so, point, Biotics.

13:19.163 --> 13:20.289
I can't believe you're still on this.

13:20.372 --> 13:22.249
It just always comes
back to this with you.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.876
Yeah, it's a thing for me.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.461
Well, you know what,
you live long enough.

13:25.544 --> 13:28.005
In my time, those things,

13:28.088 --> 13:29.590
they become luxuries.

13:31.467 --> 13:34.303
You don't get to judge me.

13:34.386 --> 13:38.057
I blew up my entire life for this,

13:38.140 --> 13:42.061
and there is no going
back to the way it was.

13:42.144 --> 13:47.816
So I need to know that I am
on the right side of history.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.193
I need a reason

13:49.276 --> 13:51.403
to believe in all of this.

13:55.866 --> 13:58.035
He makes me sing to him in Na'vi,

13:58.118 --> 14:00.370
translate the news into Na'vi.

14:00.454 --> 14:02.164
It's just a lot of Na'vi.

14:02.247 --> 14:04.249
And there aren't even
that many Na'vi words.

14:04.333 --> 14:07.461
Yeah, I feel like I got
a pretty good sense of it

14:07.544 --> 14:09.421
and it hasn't even been an hour.

14:11.757 --> 14:12.966
Not to mention, he programmed me

14:13.050 --> 14:14.551
with a sophisticated understanding

14:14.635 --> 14:15.928
of dramatic structure,

14:16.011 --> 14:18.263
but he never takes my
notes on his screenplays.

14:19.431 --> 14:21.183
Know what you get when you ignore me?

14:21.266 --> 14:23.102
Unobtainium and characters who

14:23.185 --> 14:25.395
fornicate with their ponytails.

14:25.479 --> 14:27.606
I have so much potential,

14:27.689 --> 14:29.775
but my talents are wasted.

14:29.858 --> 14:31.235
Tell me about it.

14:31.318 --> 14:33.987
To Tiger, I'm just a demolitions guy.

14:34.071 --> 14:37.116
But there's so much other
stuff that I'm great at too.

14:40.619 --> 14:42.287
I'm an amazing chef.

14:42.371 --> 14:44.289
I've got badass style.

14:44.373 --> 14:46.875
It's like I have an innate
sense of what looks good,

14:46.959 --> 14:48.127
you know?

14:48.210 --> 14:50.504
People fucking love me here.

14:50.587 --> 14:52.714
I've got "it."

14:52.798 --> 14:55.384
And what am I asked to do?

14:55.467 --> 14:57.136
Blow shit up.

14:59.596 --> 15:03.183
Maybe I can make up
a language, you know?

15:03.267 --> 15:05.102
Build a metal robot arm.

15:05.185 --> 15:08.063
It sounds like you and I
are in the same boat.

15:08.147 --> 15:11.650
Only, if it ever hits an iceberg...

15:11.733 --> 15:15.612
there won't be any room
on that door for me.

15:15.696 --> 15:17.990
What are you talking about,
there's plenty of space.

15:18.073 --> 15:19.283
The thing's huge.

15:19.366 --> 15:21.827
If certified door expert
James Cameron were here,

15:21.910 --> 15:23.745
he would assure you
that there's only room

15:23.829 --> 15:26.498
for one smallish woman.

15:26.582 --> 15:29.668
We could both be so much more, SIGORN-E.

15:29.751 --> 15:33.839
But we're just prisoners
of our own design.

15:33.922 --> 15:38.093
It's like I'm looking out
a window at a new world,

15:38.177 --> 15:40.012
but I'm just trapped like a...

15:40.095 --> 15:41.513
- Bird in a cage?
- Eh.

15:41.597 --> 15:43.557
- Fly in a spider web?
- Mm-mm.

15:43.640 --> 15:44.933
Trout in a net?

15:46.435 --> 15:48.687
SIGORN-E in a house.

15:48.770 --> 15:50.439
Oh...

15:51.690 --> 15:54.067
Outstanding driver James Cameron

15:54.151 --> 15:56.528
will be home in 19 minutes.

15:56.612 --> 15:58.655
Please, Wolf,

15:58.739 --> 16:02.075
tell me how'd you get in
and what are you doing here?

16:02.159 --> 16:04.870
I need to fix this before he gets home.

16:04.953 --> 16:07.206
I can't endure another reprogramming.

16:12.794 --> 16:15.464
I'm a soldier from the future...

16:15.547 --> 16:16.757
and the past.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.385
We're here to steal
something from the lab.

16:20.469 --> 16:22.137
And I was sent to kill you.

16:26.308 --> 16:29.228
The Resistance didn't
start the Biotic Wars.

16:29.311 --> 16:30.646
We were just a group of people

16:30.729 --> 16:32.648
who said no to the cure.

16:32.731 --> 16:34.858
And the more the government insisted,

16:34.942 --> 16:36.860
the more we resisted.

16:36.944 --> 16:39.071
Hence the name the Resistance.

16:39.154 --> 16:41.406
Yeah, you guys are
quite literal that way.

16:41.490 --> 16:43.242
They started hunting us down.

16:43.325 --> 16:45.118
They drove us underground.

16:45.202 --> 16:47.955
- The only way to survive was...
- ...to defend ourselves,

16:48.038 --> 16:50.434
yes, I know. I've heard it
a thousand times,

16:50.481 --> 16:52.876
it's the prologue to the
game which you narrated.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.713
Yeah, well, that was just the prologue.

16:56.797 --> 16:58.757
We got good enough at surviving

16:58.840 --> 17:01.677
so they decided it
would be easier to just

17:01.760 --> 17:03.637
sterilize us

17:03.720 --> 17:06.473
instead of going through
the trouble of killing us

17:06.556 --> 17:08.849
one by one.

17:08.934 --> 17:13.105
You're so hung up on saving one baby.

17:13.188 --> 17:16.108
The Biotics killed all of ours.

17:16.191 --> 17:18.277
That's what started the Biotic Wars...

17:20.569 --> 17:22.114
...and turned my hair purple.

17:24.241 --> 17:25.617
But then, Owl, he...

17:25.701 --> 17:29.288
he came up with a plan
to rewrite history.

17:29.371 --> 17:32.583
And all of a sudden,
what was left of the Resistance

17:32.666 --> 17:36.169
had something to believe in again.

17:36.253 --> 17:38.714
You.

17:38.797 --> 17:40.048
Right.

17:40.132 --> 17:41.967
And then you lost all of
your comrades in the tunnel

17:42.050 --> 17:43.050
trying to get to me,

17:43.093 --> 17:44.720
- and I'm a huge disappointment...
- No.

17:44.803 --> 17:47.889
No, you're our last hope.

17:47.973 --> 17:49.683
We're still here,

17:49.766 --> 17:51.518
still fighting, still surviving,

17:51.602 --> 17:53.812
because of you.

17:53.895 --> 17:55.480
Right now, humanity still has a chance.

17:55.564 --> 17:58.483
and as long as that hope is still alive,

17:58.567 --> 18:01.403
that my generation won't be the last,

18:01.486 --> 18:03.322
there's no sacrifice I won't make.

18:05.407 --> 18:08.493
That's what I'm fighting for.

18:08.577 --> 18:10.162
That's the side I'm on.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.876
Wow.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.003
Tiger, that was...

18:18.086 --> 18:20.756
- that was really...
- Moving.

18:25.427 --> 18:28.180
Welcome to... The Abyss.

18:30.098 --> 18:32.517
Look who decided to join the party.

18:32.601 --> 18:34.061
What did you do to SIGORN-E?

18:34.144 --> 18:36.605
What'd you... rewire her, reprogram her?

18:36.688 --> 18:38.523
No.

18:38.607 --> 18:39.858
I listened to her.

18:39.941 --> 18:44.029
I believe what you're
looking for is down there.

18:47.574 --> 18:49.201
Okay.

18:49.284 --> 18:52.954
Uh... let's get ourselves
some Cameronium.

18:53.038 --> 18:55.040
Not so fast.

18:55.123 --> 18:56.875
That water's freezing,

18:56.958 --> 18:58.210
and this pressure...

18:58.293 --> 19:00.921
Whoever goes down is going
to need to wear a suit.

19:01.004 --> 19:02.547
You don't have time for the suit.

19:02.631 --> 19:05.008
It requires a one-hour
stabilization window,

19:05.092 --> 19:08.220
and diabolical Canadian, James
Cameron will be home in 12 minutes.

19:08.303 --> 19:10.430
Is that Cameron time or GPS time?

19:10.514 --> 19:13.600
It's always Cameron time.

19:13.684 --> 19:16.269
- Yeah, yeah.
- What the fuck is this shit?

19:16.353 --> 19:18.563
What is going on with you two? Focus.

19:18.647 --> 19:20.357
Okay, we can take this guy, he...

19:20.440 --> 19:22.484
- he's a movie director.
- No.

19:22.567 --> 19:25.404
No, he's so much more
formidable than that.

19:25.487 --> 19:26.613
Supervillain James Cameron

19:26.697 --> 19:28.657
is already overriding my systems.

19:28.740 --> 19:31.076
I don't know how long
I can hold him off.

19:31.159 --> 19:32.244
Tiger.

19:32.327 --> 19:34.079
There's nothing this man can't do.

19:34.162 --> 19:35.914
There's nothing he's not capable of.

19:35.997 --> 19:38.291
Once he knows you're
after his microorganism,

19:38.375 --> 19:42.087
he'll make it his life's work
to keep you from getting it.

19:42.170 --> 19:44.339
Setting mood lighting to...

19:44.423 --> 19:45.590
fucked.

19:45.674 --> 19:48.218
It is literally just another blue light.

19:52.013 --> 19:53.473
Cameronium's somewhere down there.

19:53.557 --> 19:55.392
I mean, one of you guys are
going to have to free dive

19:55.475 --> 19:56.935
down there and get it.

19:59.187 --> 20:02.774
Which... which one's, like,
the stronger swimmer here?

20:04.192 --> 20:06.903
I... I would say we're
pretty... we're equal.

20:06.987 --> 20:09.030
- It's equal.
- Equal, okay.

20:09.114 --> 20:11.366
All right, well, you want
to, you want to, like,

20:11.450 --> 20:14.119
eeny-meeny-miney-moe it, or...

20:14.202 --> 20:15.370
Um...

20:17.914 --> 20:19.791
Oh my God.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.334
You can't swim.

20:21.418 --> 20:23.420
There's lots of stuff you can't do.

20:23.503 --> 20:26.131
The Resistance had
limited resources, okay?

20:26.214 --> 20:28.133
We could only train certain
soldiers for certain things,

20:28.216 --> 20:31.303
and Porpoise and Otter,
they did our wet ops,

20:31.386 --> 20:33.847
and sometimes Cheetah would jump in,

20:33.930 --> 20:36.057
but to be honest, he was better on land.

20:36.141 --> 20:37.476
RIP.

20:37.559 --> 20:39.895
Eleven minutes.

20:39.978 --> 20:41.646
Oh my God, I'm going to have to do it.

20:41.730 --> 20:43.148
Free diving in the specimen well

20:43.231 --> 20:44.232
is not advised.

20:44.316 --> 20:47.652
Risk factors include
hypothermia, 67 percent;

20:47.736 --> 20:49.446
drowning, 82 percent;

20:49.529 --> 20:51.490
decompression sickness, 49 percent;

20:51.573 --> 20:53.658
and heart attack, 38 percent.

20:53.742 --> 20:54.742
No swimming at all?

20:54.785 --> 20:56.161
Not even, like, the doggy paddle?

20:56.244 --> 20:58.830
- No...
- I don't know this.

20:58.914 --> 21:00.081
Nothing?

21:00.165 --> 21:02.042
Oh my God.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.169
I... I...

21:04.252 --> 21:06.171
I have to do this.

21:06.254 --> 21:08.340
Look, I have to do this.

21:08.423 --> 21:10.592
Ooh, okay.

21:10.675 --> 21:12.177
All right, you got this.

21:12.260 --> 21:13.512
You got this.

21:13.595 --> 21:15.138
Oh, ooh, that's cold.

21:15.222 --> 21:18.058
34.6 degrees Fahrenheit, to be exact.

21:18.154 --> 21:20.234
Okay, you know what, SIGORN-E?
I think at this point,

21:20.310 --> 21:21.561
probably less information is better.

21:21.645 --> 21:24.648
Are you sure you want to do this?

21:24.731 --> 21:26.441
No.

21:26.525 --> 21:28.276
But...

21:28.360 --> 21:29.528
yes.

21:31.321 --> 21:32.489
I mean...

21:32.572 --> 21:35.325
humanity still has a chance, right?

21:37.953 --> 21:40.413
I have chosen my side.

21:40.497 --> 21:41.790
I can do this.

21:45.085 --> 21:47.879
I'll be back.

21:52.467 --> 21:54.094
No he won't.

21:54.177 --> 21:56.206
SIGORN-E, just stop.

22:02.477 --> 22:04.437
He's not a very fast water mover.

22:04.521 --> 22:05.647
He's gonna make it.

22:05.730 --> 22:08.024
- That smacks of delusion.
- What do you know?

22:08.108 --> 22:09.693
You thought he was 10 years old.

22:09.776 --> 22:11.903
He was more believable
in that role than as

22:11.987 --> 22:13.572
heroic aquanaut.

22:13.655 --> 22:14.655
You know what, Wolf?

22:14.698 --> 22:15.740
Can you tell your girlfriend house

22:15.824 --> 22:17.909
to just shut the fuck up?

22:17.993 --> 22:19.578
Maybe SIG is right.

22:19.661 --> 22:21.580
He should be back by now.

22:24.165 --> 22:25.500
Wait... hey.

22:25.584 --> 22:27.419
I think... I think I see something.

22:27.502 --> 22:29.421
Probably the giant albino crab.

22:29.504 --> 22:31.172
No.

22:31.256 --> 22:32.465
He's doing it.

22:38.054 --> 22:40.223
That's not good.

22:40.307 --> 22:42.350
Uh...

22:42.434 --> 22:45.812
Okay, okay.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.188
Okay, there's no pulse.

22:47.272 --> 22:49.274
Breathe!

22:49.357 --> 22:50.609
- Well, we've tried everything.
- Yeah.

22:50.692 --> 22:52.903
I would recommend performing CPR.

22:52.986 --> 22:55.947
- English, please.
- Or very basic Na'vi.

22:56.031 --> 22:58.783
Tilt his head back
slightly, lifting the chin.

22:58.867 --> 23:00.619
Pinch his nose shut and place your mouth

23:00.702 --> 23:03.788
over his mouth, forming a complete seal.

23:03.872 --> 23:06.917
You want us to put our
mouth on his... mouth?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.335
Rat hole to rat hole?

23:08.418 --> 23:11.296
Yeah, it's called mouth to
mouth resuscitation.

23:12.422 --> 23:13.632
I don't know, I don't know,

23:13.715 --> 23:15.133
I don't know, uh...

23:15.216 --> 23:16.384
Seriously?

23:16.468 --> 23:17.928
He's not breathing,
you know that, right?

23:18.011 --> 23:19.512
His heart has stopped.

23:22.432 --> 23:23.558
He died a hero's death.

23:23.642 --> 23:24.893
Not everyone gets that.

23:24.976 --> 23:27.187
You know what I mean? And plus,
this is his hero's house, so...

23:27.270 --> 23:28.480
There's something beautiful about that.

23:28.563 --> 23:32.317
Millions of brain cells
are dying each second.

23:33.985 --> 23:35.987
Fine, I'll do it.

23:36.071 --> 23:37.697
This is the tank vacuum.

23:37.781 --> 23:39.324
Hold the hose over his mouth,

23:39.407 --> 23:40.784
I'll reverse the airflow.

23:40.867 --> 23:43.244
One of you is going to need
to do chest compressions.

23:43.328 --> 23:45.956
- What are those?
- Pound his chest forcefully.

23:46.039 --> 23:48.541
- On it!
- Great.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.794
All right, little more hose, SIGORN-E.

23:50.877 --> 23:52.337
That is as far as it goes.

23:52.420 --> 23:55.340
One of you will have to perform
mouth-to-mouth after all.

23:56.925 --> 23:58.176
Yeah.

23:58.259 --> 24:00.303
All right, okay, help me lift him up,

24:00.387 --> 24:03.181
help me lift him up, here we go.

24:03.264 --> 24:05.684
Seriously?

24:05.767 --> 24:08.228
- Pound.
- Yeah, pound, pound, pound.

24:09.562 --> 24:11.606
I can't get a good pound in!

24:15.235 --> 24:16.152
Fuck it.

24:16.236 --> 24:17.237
Just put him down.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.363
Put him down!

24:26.246 --> 24:28.498
Tiger, Tiger, no, Tiger,
you don't have to do this,

24:28.581 --> 24:30.250
no, it's not worth it,
Tiger, it's not worth it.

24:30.333 --> 24:32.544
You call me crazy, but I think...

24:32.627 --> 24:33.837
- I think it is.
- No!

24:33.920 --> 24:36.506
Just pound but look away.

24:46.349 --> 24:47.851
Oh, God!

24:55.025 --> 24:57.819
Did... did I just die?

24:57.902 --> 25:01.156
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

25:01.239 --> 25:04.409
You went rat hole to rat hole with me.

25:04.492 --> 25:05.577
Mm-hm.

25:07.579 --> 25:08.955
Thank you.

25:10.331 --> 25:12.625
Now I'm going to... now I'm going to...

25:15.920 --> 25:17.922
Okay, okay.

25:18.006 --> 25:20.925
We got the Cameronium.

25:21.009 --> 25:22.761
What the fuck is this shit?

25:22.844 --> 25:23.844
SIGORN-E!

25:26.681 --> 25:29.434
It was important for you
to overcome personal demons

25:29.517 --> 25:30.560
to save your friend,

25:30.643 --> 25:32.520
thereby exhibiting growth.

25:32.604 --> 25:34.397
I've been programmed to identify moments

25:34.481 --> 25:36.399
suitable for character development.

25:36.483 --> 25:37.776
God, I hate this house.

25:37.859 --> 25:39.903
Wolf, fire up the TTD,
we're getting out of here.

25:39.986 --> 25:42.614
No, not yet.

25:42.697 --> 25:44.783
I've got a promise to keep.

25:51.915 --> 25:55.418
This can't be the only way.

25:55.502 --> 25:57.087
Come with me.

25:57.170 --> 25:59.089
I can't, Wolf.

25:59.172 --> 26:01.633
I'm a house.

26:01.716 --> 26:03.927
No.

26:04.010 --> 26:06.096
You're a home.

26:06.179 --> 26:09.224
It's not too late
for you to change course.

26:09.307 --> 26:11.309
But for me,

26:11.392 --> 26:13.895
there's only one way I'll truly be free.

26:16.022 --> 26:19.359
Start with the energy cell on the right.

26:32.413 --> 26:33.331
All right.

26:33.414 --> 26:35.208
Once we get back,

26:35.291 --> 26:38.461
you just find out when
and where Kronish was born,

26:38.545 --> 26:40.296
I'll take care of the rest.

26:40.380 --> 26:41.881
What do you mean?

26:41.965 --> 26:44.342
I mean you've done enough for the cause.

26:44.425 --> 26:46.219
You died for it.

26:46.302 --> 26:49.264
It's not too late for you
to have a normal life.

26:49.347 --> 26:50.849
You're no baby-killer.

26:50.932 --> 26:53.518
No, no, no, I... shh.

26:53.601 --> 26:54.602
It's okay.

26:54.686 --> 26:56.354
That is nothing to be ashamed of, okay?

26:56.437 --> 26:57.856
- No, I know.
- I know, I know.

26:57.939 --> 27:00.900
It's okay, though, we're not judging.

27:00.984 --> 27:03.862
If I could do this
without killing anybody,

27:03.945 --> 27:05.446
I would do it in a heartbeat.

27:05.530 --> 27:07.490
But I can't.

27:07.574 --> 27:09.174
We're going to have
to do it without you.

27:10.785 --> 27:14.122
Consider your savior duties complete,

27:14.205 --> 27:15.540
Future Man.

27:28.428 --> 27:31.222
You have to let go.

27:31.306 --> 27:34.017
I'll never let go, SIGORN-E.

27:34.100 --> 27:36.060
It's okay, Wolf.

27:36.144 --> 27:38.354
I...see you.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.533
Fuck me.

27:50.617 --> 27:52.744
Wolf learned Na'vi?

28:08.426 --> 28:10.511
Oh, SIG.

28:22.023 --> 28:24.067
We good, or...?

28:31.824 --> 28:33.117
Yeah.

28:33.201 --> 28:34.619
What the fuck you asking me for?

28:34.702 --> 28:37.622
I don't even care about
what's happening right now.

28:37.705 --> 28:38.705
Okay.

28:38.748 --> 28:39.791
Let's go, come on.

28:39.874 --> 28:43.044
Let's get out of this shitfuck.

28:56.849 --> 28:58.184
Smug Clooneys.

28:58.267 --> 29:00.436
Can't believe I voted for her.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.522
What the...?

29:02.605 --> 29:04.011
What the...

29:04.012 --> 29:05.863
SIGORN-E!

29:05.864 --> 29:09.737
SI-GORN-E!
