The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:02.535 --> 00:04.667
I can't force him
to go to therapy!

00:04.667 --> 00:06.035
He'll go when
he's ready to go!

00:06.035 --> 00:07.370
I almost got shot!

00:07.370 --> 00:09.539
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that guy's face.

00:09.539 --> 00:12.275
You got two choices,
this guy Chan that your
doctor recommended,

00:12.275 --> 00:13.943
or Dr. Fields,
who I recommend.

00:13.943 --> 00:15.978
My grandmother was
hoping you could kind of

00:15.978 --> 00:17.980
hang out with me at the house
until she gets home tonight.

00:17.980 --> 00:20.149
I told her I was going
to be helping you
with your algebra.

00:20.149 --> 00:22.018
Can you watch John?
I can't.

00:22.018 --> 00:23.085
You didn't hear?
He bought Geoff's.

00:23.085 --> 00:25.087
Geoff's restaurant?

00:25.087 --> 00:26.622
Obviously, I can't
go to school here
and leave John with you.

00:26.622 --> 00:28.024
And what does
that mean?

00:28.024 --> 00:29.659
The baby daddy called
the adoptive couple.

00:29.659 --> 00:31.060
He wants to
see the baby.

00:31.060 --> 00:33.629
I did not
send Ben to New York
to be with Amy.

00:33.629 --> 00:34.997
I wanted to know.

00:34.997 --> 00:36.632
She's their baby,
they're adopting her.

00:36.632 --> 00:38.167
Not if I change my mind.

00:38.167 --> 00:39.435
That guy is a liar.

00:39.435 --> 00:40.570
Tell me why you're here.

00:40.570 --> 00:42.538
I'm too scared to sleep.

00:42.538 --> 00:45.475
Someday soon,
Anne is going to
make us move from here.

00:45.475 --> 00:46.676
Anne's not going to
make us do anything.

00:46.676 --> 00:47.977
"I'm going to
start looking."

00:47.977 --> 00:49.178
Just say it.

00:49.178 --> 00:50.379
I don't want
to lose you.

00:50.379 --> 00:51.614
Where are you going?

00:51.614 --> 00:54.217
To the nicest hotel suite
that I can get into.

00:54.217 --> 00:56.686
This is progress,
real progress.

00:56.686 --> 00:58.421
(LOUD SNORING)

01:00.556 --> 01:04.327
I think the problem
is that you don't know
what an integer is.

01:04.327 --> 01:07.630
Integers are positive
and negative whole numbers.

01:07.630 --> 01:10.533
So, what are two even
consecutive integers

01:10.533 --> 01:13.503
that add up to 26?

01:15.571 --> 01:17.540
I have no idea.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.375
Then we'll figure it out.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.544
And the way
we figure it out is...

01:25.615 --> 01:29.919
Well, something was wrong,
but I think Ethan
has a handle on it.

01:32.421 --> 01:35.558
Ethan is there at 9:00
at night getting a handle
on things? What things?

01:35.558 --> 01:37.059
Grandma is still
at the hospital

01:37.059 --> 01:39.161
with her friend
who had surgery.

01:39.161 --> 01:40.897
I'm going to let you
speak to Ethan.

01:40.897 --> 01:42.498
I don't want to
speak to Ethan.

01:42.498 --> 01:44.300
I've spoken to Ethan
enough to last me a...
Bonjour.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.168
I hope you're
enjoying your visit
to the City of Lights.

01:46.936 --> 01:48.471
Uh...

01:48.471 --> 01:52.441
I'm not in Paris,
I'm in the south of France,
in Provence.

01:52.441 --> 01:56.913
Oh. Well, I just wanted
to update you on what's
going on with Kathy

01:56.913 --> 01:58.080
and her situation here.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.449
Why you? Why not Kathy?

02:00.449 --> 02:03.119
And to what situation
are you referring?

02:03.119 --> 02:04.587
Well, sir, here's the thing.

02:04.587 --> 02:07.089
Your mom had to go
to visit a sick friend
in the hospital.

02:07.089 --> 02:08.958
I heard. And?

02:08.958 --> 02:11.093
And I'm staying
here with Kathy
until she gets home.

02:11.093 --> 02:13.229
In an empty house
with no supervision.

02:13.229 --> 02:15.898
I said the same thing
when she invited me,

02:15.898 --> 02:17.166
but apparently
we are trustworthy.

02:17.166 --> 02:18.467
We'll see. Get to the point.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.469
Don, the baby's father...

02:20.469 --> 02:22.572
I know who Don is.

02:22.572 --> 02:25.441
Don called the adoptive family
and asked to see the baby.

02:25.441 --> 02:27.476
He did what?

02:27.476 --> 02:29.579
Well, he said that
he wanted to consider
taking the baby himself.

02:29.579 --> 02:31.080
He's not going to do that.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.382
And me,
he wanted to take me.

02:33.382 --> 02:36.385
He wanted the two of them,
Kathy and the baby,

02:36.385 --> 02:39.589
to go back to Texas with him,
and he left asking her
to think about it.

02:39.589 --> 02:41.123
And how do you
come in to this?

02:41.123 --> 02:43.492
Having overheard
their conversation,

02:43.492 --> 02:45.528
with Kathy's
permission, of course,

02:45.528 --> 02:49.532
I deduced that this Don guy
is only here to try to get
someone to pay him off.

02:49.532 --> 02:51.300
Pay him off for what?

02:51.300 --> 02:54.170
Exactly. I mean,
he didn't say
he needed money,

02:54.170 --> 02:57.406
but he did say, however,
that he didn't have
the money to go to college,

02:57.406 --> 02:58.941
so he was going to
get a job.

02:58.941 --> 03:00.643
So he didn't ask for money?

03:00.643 --> 03:02.478
No.
So you just

03:03.379 --> 03:04.480
deduced this?

03:04.480 --> 03:06.449
Well, yeah.
He's street smart!

03:06.449 --> 03:08.250
I don't want you
to get in the middle of this,

03:08.250 --> 03:10.353
and I don't want Don
to jeopardize the adoption.

03:10.353 --> 03:14.023
Me neither.
But it's blackmail,
don't you think?

03:14.023 --> 03:17.093
Maybe we should
call the police or the FBI.

03:17.093 --> 03:19.161
Or, maybe Kathy
should just talk to him

03:19.161 --> 03:20.496
and ask him
if he's after money,

03:20.496 --> 03:22.365
or if he really
just wants to see the baby

03:22.365 --> 03:25.501
before we turn this
into a federal case.

03:25.501 --> 03:26.969
Oh. Well, okay.

03:26.969 --> 03:28.170
If you want me
to handle it...

03:28.170 --> 03:31.440
I don't. I want Kathy
to handle it with Don,

03:31.440 --> 03:34.076
and her mother and I will
handle it with Don's parents.

03:34.076 --> 03:35.411
Let me speak to her.

03:35.411 --> 03:36.946
And...

03:36.946 --> 03:38.681
Don't go anywhere
near her,

03:38.681 --> 03:40.182
especially with
her grandmother out
of the house.

We're just studying, sir,

03:42.585 --> 03:43.686
she's helping me
with algebra.

03:43.686 --> 03:45.087
And why is that?

03:45.087 --> 03:46.689
Because I stink at algebra.

03:46.689 --> 03:49.058
So did I.
Really?

03:49.058 --> 03:50.660
That's awesome.

03:51.494 --> 03:53.129
Here she is.

I'd be home.

Did you?

text messages that you
didn't respond to

04:53.055 --> 04:54.990
after I said I sat next to Amy
on the flight.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.026
I turned off my phone
after Ben texted me.

04:57.026 --> 04:59.361
(CHUCKLES)
I knew he texted you.

04:59.361 --> 05:01.530
Which is why
you texted me.

05:01.530 --> 05:04.266
Look, I'm not upset
that you sat next to her,

05:04.266 --> 05:06.435
I'm upset that Ben
told me first.

05:06.435 --> 05:08.304
They told us
to put away our phones.

05:08.304 --> 05:10.573
Yet Ben took the risk
and texted me
and you didn't.

Oh. Yeah, I am.
I keep forgetting.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.449
So, what did you get me?

05:20.449 --> 05:23.352
Something that was so big,
it had to be mailed.

05:23.352 --> 05:26.155

What kind of jewelry
has to be mailed?

05:26.155 --> 05:29.425

05:36.665 --> 05:40.402

about moving to New York?

05:40.402 --> 05:44.974
I would think
that I hate you
for suggesting it

if you think I am going to
drop out of school

05:47.343 --> 05:49.011

was quiet enough to think in?

was so loud.

I missed that.
Ah, next time.

07:01.550 --> 07:02.551
Absolutely.

You could have
stayed up all night
and partied, you know.

This is the finance office.

that kind of thing a thing.

It's not really
that important,
not to you anyway.

07:16.599 --> 07:18.300
Yeah, probably not.
Probably?

07:18.300 --> 07:20.069
You don't need a loan,

07:20.069 --> 07:22.071
and you're probably not
going to stay in a dorm here

07:22.071 --> 07:24.373
since you couldn't even
stay one night
in a dorm.

07:24.373 --> 07:25.975
We'll see about that.

on living in a dorm?

would I live?

milking anything,

and a dorm room
where my family can visit.

"Have to" is a little strong,
don't you think?

07:50.666 --> 07:52.534
Are you really
going to go here?
That depends.

07:52.534 --> 07:54.136
On whether or not
I go here?

07:54.136 --> 07:55.905
That might have
something to do with it,

07:55.905 --> 07:59.308
but it's also because
it's New York,

07:59.308 --> 08:02.678
and I happen to like
New York and I have
uncles and cousins

08:02.678 --> 08:04.146

around here, so...

all over the world,

why can't you go

and I think she
overcompensates by...

Being arrogant?

08:47.089 --> 08:48.557
Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

08:48.557 --> 08:53.228
So, Amy, I see
you've decided to major
in secondary education,

08:53.228 --> 08:54.496
teach high school?

08:54.496 --> 08:56.899
Yeah.
Why?

08:56.899 --> 09:01.236
Um, well, I know
how important high school is?

09:01.236 --> 09:04.106
Is that a question?
No, um, sorry.

09:04.106 --> 09:06.041
High school is important.

09:06.041 --> 09:09.111
And I think my experience
in high school makes me
uniquely qualified

09:09.111 --> 09:10.646
to teach
high school students.

09:10.646 --> 09:12.381
Unique how?

09:12.381 --> 09:14.249
Well, I have
a three-year-old.

09:14.249 --> 09:17.086
All right.
I had him
while in high school.

09:18.087 --> 09:21.023
All right.
And yet I finished
high school

09:21.023 --> 09:22.591
and I'm graduating
on time

09:22.591 --> 09:25.127
and I'm thinking about going
to Hudson University.

09:25.127 --> 09:26.929
Otherwise I wouldn't
be here.

09:26.929 --> 09:30.132
And whether or not I get
into a dorm will help me
determine that.

09:30.132 --> 09:33.936
You opted
for early acceptance.
Yes, I did.

09:33.936 --> 09:36.071
If you apply
for early acceptance,

09:36.071 --> 09:39.074
then you agree to come
if accepted.

09:39.074 --> 09:43.078
You applied, you agreed,
ergo you're coming.

09:43.078 --> 09:46.215
And you were eligible
for financial aid,

09:46.215 --> 09:48.183
so you're getting
financial aid.

09:49.585 --> 09:52.154
That's nice,

09:52.154 --> 09:56.025
but that's really just
a whopping student loan.

09:56.025 --> 10:00.195
I agree. It's to cover
the whopping tuition.

10:00.195 --> 10:03.098
Okay. Well,
I'd really need to know
where I'd be living

10:03.098 --> 10:05.300
before I can really
formally accept.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.570
You formally accepted
when you signed
the application.

10:08.570 --> 10:11.273
Not really.
No, really.

10:11.273 --> 10:13.509
There was
a $2,000 application fee.

10:13.509 --> 10:16.417
It's very high because
we want to make sure

10:16.417 --> 10:18.987
that students asking
for early acceptance
are serious.

10:21.256 --> 10:23.358
It's non-refundable.
Non-refundable?

10:25.126 --> 10:28.997
Okay, I guess
I didn't understand that.

10:28.997 --> 10:32.000
A summer course
in reading comprehension
might be prudent.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.237
I do want to be here,
but I just don't know if I can
afford to be here.

10:36.237 --> 10:38.473
What are my chances
of getting a dorm room?

10:38.473 --> 10:41.309
You can get a dorm room.
Most freshmen share a space.

10:41.309 --> 10:43.444
Did you want a single,
which is more expensive,

10:43.444 --> 10:45.213
or did you want to
share a space?

10:45.213 --> 10:47.916
Oh, well, the thing is,
I do have a three-year-old.

10:47.916 --> 10:50.118
Who cannot live
in the dorm.

10:50.118 --> 10:51.519
But he can visit, of course.

10:51.519 --> 10:52.854
Overnight?
Yeah.

10:52.854 --> 10:56.190
No.
My son can't visit me
at school?

10:56.190 --> 10:59.060
What about his father?
None of our business.

10:59.060 --> 11:01.262
Well, look, it's always
been my dream

11:01.262 --> 11:03.298
to be here to go
to school in New York.

11:03.298 --> 11:05.366
So, I will figure
the housing situation out.

11:05.366 --> 11:06.501
Good.

11:08.036 --> 11:09.370
See you in the fall.

11:09.370 --> 11:11.005
And if I don't figure out
the housing situation

11:11.005 --> 11:13.174
and I can't go to school
here because of that?

11:13.174 --> 11:17.078
The school just
made $2,000 processing
your application

11:17.078 --> 11:20.248
and some poor student
didn't get in here

11:20.248 --> 11:22.317
because you agreed
you'd be here

11:22.317 --> 11:24.485
using the money
they could have had.

11:24.485 --> 11:26.521
Thank you.

11:26.521 --> 11:29.157
She doesn't seem like she
has much personality to me.

11:29.157 --> 11:30.858
I was standing in line...

11:32.827 --> 11:34.062
...next to her yesterday.

11:34.062 --> 11:36.230
And she started telling me
all about New York.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.899
I mean, I went to high school
in New York.

11:37.899 --> 11:39.901
Ugh.

11:39.901 --> 11:41.836
I hate these tourists
who come in thinking they
know more than we know.

11:41.836 --> 11:43.237
Hey, you're talking
to a tourist.

11:43.237 --> 11:45.139
See, that's the attitude
you should have.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.474
Amy did live here
for a summer.

11:46.474 --> 11:47.942
A whole summer.

11:47.942 --> 11:48.943
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

11:49.911 --> 11:51.045
Ben Boykewich?

11:51.045 --> 11:52.981
Is it Boy-ke-wich
or Boy-ke-vich?

11:52.981 --> 11:55.450
It's however you'd like
to pronounce it, but my dad
says, "Boy-ke-vich."

11:57.852 --> 11:59.821
Have a seat. I'm sorry.

11:59.821 --> 12:03.191
I think you were actually
here before that last girl
but I screwed up.

12:03.191 --> 12:05.259
(SIGHS)

12:05.259 --> 12:07.895
Don't worry about it,
I screwed up
with that last girl myself.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.531
You're not the father
of the baby, are you?

12:10.531 --> 12:13.935
No. I wanted to be,
but no.

12:13.935 --> 12:16.371
Do you really want
to go to school here

12:16.371 --> 12:18.339
or are you just
following the girl?

12:19.374 --> 12:21.109
Yeah, I want to come
to school here,

12:21.109 --> 12:23.845
but I'm pretty much
following the girl.

12:23.845 --> 12:26.981
Do you plan to go to class,
live on campus, while
you're pursuing her?

12:26.981 --> 12:29.817
Sure, if I come here.
"If?"

12:29.817 --> 12:33.154
Did your guidance counselor
not explain this to you?

12:33.154 --> 12:35.223
If you ask
for early acceptance,

12:35.223 --> 12:39.260
then you agree
to come here if you get in,
and you got in.

12:39.260 --> 12:40.495
Okay.

12:40.495 --> 12:42.430
So I'll come here.
Are you sure?

12:42.430 --> 12:44.032
Pretty sure. I mean,
what are you going to do

12:44.032 --> 12:45.199
if I don't? Arrest me?

12:45.199 --> 12:48.403
Keep the $2,000
application fee.

12:48.403 --> 12:51.873
I'm sure my dad knew
that was a risk,

12:51.873 --> 12:56.244
but even if Amy
doesn't come here,
I rather like the place, so...

12:57.045 --> 12:58.079
I think I will come here.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.982
All right! Well,

13:00.982 --> 13:04.185
we do have dorm space
available for you,

13:04.185 --> 13:08.756
although I imagine
you'll be taking
an apartment as well

13:08.756 --> 13:10.825
because that's what
you rich boys do.

13:10.825 --> 13:13.094
If my rich dad
will let me, sure.

13:13.094 --> 13:16.297
The girl
you screwed up with,

13:16.297 --> 13:19.434
she's going to need
a place to live. Perhaps you
could share an apartment.

13:19.434 --> 13:21.803
Are you friends with her
and her fiance?

13:21.803 --> 13:23.871
Oh, yeah.
We're all friends.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.841
And that sounds
like an excellent idea,
sharing an apartment.

13:26.841 --> 13:29.777
As long as you don't mind
the three-year-old visiting.

13:32.113 --> 13:35.183
It'll give you a chance
to see what you missed.

13:47.762 --> 13:49.230
Hi, Dr. Rodriguez.

13:49.230 --> 13:50.898
Your assistant said I should
just bring this over to you.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.433
I wasn't here yesterday.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.202
I hate to bother you
outside your office.

13:54.202 --> 13:55.870
Yeah, I told her
to send you over.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.238
I'm going to have
a cup of coffee.

13:57.238 --> 13:59.974
I thought I'd read your paper
while I'm sitting here.

13:59.974 --> 14:01.909
Are you feeling all right?

14:01.909 --> 14:03.811
I'm fine.

14:03.811 --> 14:06.981
I have a three-year-old.
There was an issue
with his daycare yesterday.

14:06.981 --> 14:09.283
So, I had to take
the day off.

14:09.283 --> 14:12.253
It's never happened before,
and it won't happen again.
Promise.

14:12.253 --> 14:13.754
Really?

14:13.754 --> 14:16.090
I have three children
and, based on my experience,

14:16.090 --> 14:17.892
I think it's going to
happen again.

14:17.892 --> 14:21.062
No, see, my, uh, fiancee
and I live together

14:21.062 --> 14:23.898
and John, that's our son,
stays at the church nursery

14:23.898 --> 14:26.868
and Amy, that's my...
Fiancee.

14:26.868 --> 14:30.138
She's a senior in high school
and she works at the nursery
after school

14:30.138 --> 14:32.206
and it's always
worked out before,

14:32.206 --> 14:35.109
but she had to go
to New York and I had
John to myself

14:35.109 --> 14:38.212
and, like I said,
there was an issue
at daycare.

14:38.212 --> 14:40.148
Who hit whom?

14:40.148 --> 14:42.850
(CHUCKLES) A kid bit him,
he bit him back,
they sent them both home.

14:44.919 --> 14:47.855
So you're what, 18,
19 years old?

14:47.855 --> 14:49.891
Nineteen.
And you're
getting married?

14:49.891 --> 14:52.527
I think so.
We're planning on it,
sometime this summer.

14:52.527 --> 14:54.262
You're awfully young
to be getting married.

14:54.262 --> 14:57.131
John is three.
I think it's time
we got married.

14:57.932 --> 14:59.300
Well, good for you.

14:59.300 --> 15:03.271
I got pregnant
before I got married,
but he took off.

15:03.271 --> 15:07.408
Then, a few years later,
I got married and had
a couple more kids.

15:07.408 --> 15:08.476
I love kids.

15:09.877 --> 15:12.847
My husband and I
are very happy.

15:12.847 --> 15:15.883
You know,
who you'd marry at 19 is not
who you'd marry at 29

15:15.883 --> 15:17.818
is not who you'd marry at 39.

15:19.453 --> 15:21.222
Well, thanks
for bringing this over.

15:21.222 --> 15:24.225
And, uh, you do know
that there's daycare
on campus, don't you?

15:24.926 --> 15:26.060
Uh, for?

15:26.060 --> 15:28.829
For anyone five or under
who needs it.

15:28.829 --> 15:32.433
And there's pre-kindergarten
and kindergarten
and after school care as well.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.834
I had no idea.

15:33.834 --> 15:35.536
Check it out. I don't know
if you can use it

15:35.536 --> 15:38.739
as a fallback
in an emergency,
but maybe.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.808
I really appreciate
the information.

15:40.808 --> 15:42.476
I think I'll go
check it out right now.

15:42.476 --> 15:44.879
You're doing a good job
in this class, Ricky.

15:44.879 --> 15:46.180
You've got a head
for business.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.248
Thanks.

15:54.422 --> 15:56.157
Hi, Adrian.
Shut up.

15:56.891 --> 15:57.825
Okay.

16:01.796 --> 16:04.899
I hope this isn't about Amy
sitting next to Omar
on the way to New York.

16:04.899 --> 16:06.534
Who cares
about that?
I don't.

16:06.534 --> 16:08.169
I don't either.

16:08.169 --> 16:10.071
All right, well,
you told me to shut up
so I just figured

16:10.071 --> 16:12.907
that something was wrong
and I was looking
for a common denominator.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.277
Omar wants me
to move to New York.

16:16.277 --> 16:18.312
Because of his
new job?
Yeah.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.414
Can you believe that?

16:20.414 --> 16:21.949
He just sprung it on me,
like I'd want to move
across the country.

16:21.949 --> 16:23.751
Are you going to go?
I don't want to go.

16:23.751 --> 16:24.952
I don't want to go either.

16:24.952 --> 16:26.854
To New York.

16:26.854 --> 16:29.857
I love my life here,
and my family is here
and that's important to me.

16:29.857 --> 16:32.226
And you love Amy
and John.
Yeah.

16:32.226 --> 16:33.961
Well, Amy and John
are going to be
in New York, so...

16:33.961 --> 16:35.296
She hasn't decided that yet.

16:35.296 --> 16:36.464
Wake up!

16:36.464 --> 16:37.898
She wouldn't be there
right now

16:37.898 --> 16:39.066
if she didn't really
want to be there.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.769
She just needed
the freedom to go,
to decide.

16:41.769 --> 16:44.171
I'm pretty sure Amy is not
going to leave California
to go to school.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.274
I'm sure she is.

16:46.274 --> 16:49.176
All right, you know what,
Ricky? Listen to me,

16:49.176 --> 16:51.879
and I don't say this
because we were all
hot for each other

16:51.879 --> 16:53.914
for a few years, okay?

16:53.914 --> 16:55.283
I say this because
we're friends.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.519
Don't marry that girl.

16:58.519 --> 17:02.423
Why not?
Because she doesn't
want to be married.

17:02.423 --> 17:04.392
She doesn't want
to have a baby.

17:04.392 --> 17:08.763
She wants to have
the life she would have had
if she hadn't met you.

17:08.763 --> 17:11.832
She's not going to be happy
until she moves to New York,

17:11.832 --> 17:13.768
goes to school there,

17:13.768 --> 17:17.738
graduates, travels the world,
has a job and an apartment
on her own.

17:18.506 --> 17:21.742
And experiences
other men.

17:21.742 --> 17:22.777
Why would you say that?

17:23.811 --> 17:24.945
Because I'm a girl.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.783
Hey, guys, how are you
this morning?

17:28.783 --> 17:30.017
How are you?

17:30.017 --> 17:31.919
I am so much better,
Adrian, thank you so much.

17:31.919 --> 17:33.888
Talking to Dr. Fields
was amazing.

17:33.888 --> 17:35.122
I slept 10 hours last night.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.224
Alone?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.260
Kind of.
What does that mean?

17:39.260 --> 17:42.463
It means that I was
at my parents' house
and they were nearby.

17:42.463 --> 17:44.832
All right. Well, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.234
Think about what I said.

17:49.804 --> 17:51.839
She gives good advice.

17:51.839 --> 17:55.042
I don't know
how good her advice is
about relationships.

17:55.042 --> 17:56.243
Everything okay?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.512
Are you and Amy
still getting married?

17:58.512 --> 18:00.047
You want to weigh in
on that, too?

18:00.047 --> 18:02.350
Sure. Yeah. Life is short.
Don't be miserable.

18:02.350 --> 18:05.486
Okay, thanks.
That's very helpful.
See ya.

18:08.956 --> 18:10.324
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:18.299 --> 18:20.267
Jack! Hey!

18:20.267 --> 18:21.902
Pleasure to meet you.

18:21.902 --> 18:24.372
I recognize you
from the newspapers.

18:24.372 --> 18:25.973
Johnny D.

18:25.973 --> 18:28.075
Yeah, my dad was
a little confused
on who you are

18:28.075 --> 18:29.777
and why you're trying
to reach me.

18:29.777 --> 18:31.946
He said something
about the insurance claims?

18:31.946 --> 18:34.949
Sit down, sit down,
let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

18:34.949 --> 18:36.317
(EXCLAIMS)

18:36.317 --> 18:38.786
Must be torture
having those casts on.

18:38.786 --> 18:40.454
Yeah. Hopefully,
a few more weeks
and that's it.

18:40.454 --> 18:43.324
Not that I'm complaining,
I'm just lucky to be alive.

18:43.324 --> 18:45.493
Couldn't have
put it better myself.

18:45.493 --> 18:47.528
What a horrible thing
to go through.

18:47.528 --> 18:49.196
Yeah, things
are looking up.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.965
Oh?

18:50.965 --> 18:53.100
Why's that?
The Lord has blessed me
with a lot of good friends.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.469
You know, I'm getting
a lot of good advice
from a lot of good people.

18:55.469 --> 18:58.038
Are you getting
any financial help?

18:58.406 --> 19:00.040
I don't need any.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.476
The school covered
all the medical expenses

19:02.476 --> 19:04.378
and even though
I didn't get hurt
during a game,

19:04.378 --> 19:06.414
they've covered my tuition,

19:06.414 --> 19:08.215
and my dorm room
is still available to me
as long as I'm working

19:08.215 --> 19:09.316
toward getting back
on the team.

19:10.751 --> 19:13.921
Two words. Punitive damages.

19:13.921 --> 19:15.356
The school
wants to punish me?

19:15.356 --> 19:16.457
They want me
to pay them?

19:16.457 --> 19:18.392
Oh, no.

19:18.392 --> 19:20.861
You want
to punish them.
I do?

19:20.861 --> 19:22.897
Seems to me

19:22.897 --> 19:26.534
the whole thing could have
been prevented with a
reasonable amount of security.

19:26.534 --> 19:29.470
And that coach
never should have
labeled you as a Christian

19:29.470 --> 19:31.238
just to get publicity.

19:31.238 --> 19:35.242
This is about making
this campus and the dorms
safer for everyone.

19:36.410 --> 19:40.080
It's a selfless act
for the protection of others.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.351
And you'll get millions
of dollars.

19:55.162 --> 19:58.199
You didn't explain
what "early admissions" means.

19:58.199 --> 19:59.834
I'm pretty sure I did.

19:59.834 --> 20:01.469
I'm pretty sure
that you didn't.

20:01.469 --> 20:04.772
I'm going to lose $2,000
if I decide not to
go to go to the school.

20:04.772 --> 20:06.440
Yeah, that fee
is non-refundable.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.809
You forfeit that
if you change your mind.

20:08.809 --> 20:10.110
It's right there
on the application.

20:10.110 --> 20:11.912
That you helped me
fill out!

20:11.912 --> 20:15.749
Well, you wanted
to be sure you got in,
and, well, you got in.

20:15.749 --> 20:17.284
How's it going,
by the way?

20:17.284 --> 20:20.521
It's going great, actually.
The programs are outstanding.

20:20.521 --> 20:23.157
So is the faculty and staff.

20:23.157 --> 20:25.125
Only I can't live in
a stupid dorm room

20:25.125 --> 20:28.996
so I can't go here and I want
my money back in case I don't!

20:28.996 --> 20:30.764
Why can't you get
a dorm room?

20:30.764 --> 20:34.101
Because John and Ricky
can't stay in it
when they come to visit

20:34.101 --> 20:35.536
so I have to live
somewhere else.

20:35.536 --> 20:38.005
I guess I assumed
that they'd
move there with you

20:38.005 --> 20:39.740
and you guys would get
an apartment together.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.209
I can't afford an apartment.
We can't afford an apartment.

20:42.209 --> 20:44.245
Well, I can't imagine
you'll find something
in Manhattan,

20:44.245 --> 20:47.414
but, I mean, the dorm rooms
are 15 to 20 grand a year.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.950
So an apartment
couldn't be that much more,
could it?

20:49.950 --> 20:53.954
Twenty thousand
dollars a year
for this?

20:53.954 --> 20:55.789
That's ridiculous.

20:55.789 --> 20:58.959
Did you read any
of the materials I gave you
on Hudson University?

20:58.959 --> 21:00.060
(STAMMERING)

21:00.060 --> 21:01.896
It's expensive
to go to school there.

21:01.896 --> 21:03.397
Well, all schools
are expensive.

21:03.397 --> 21:06.534
True, but it's a lot cheaper
to go to school in state,

21:06.534 --> 21:09.203
especially since you and Ricky
have a free apartment.

21:09.203 --> 21:11.272
I mean, that's what
you said, right?

21:11.272 --> 21:14.775
I'm not gonna go in state
just because Leo Boykewich
gave Ricky a free apartment.

21:14.775 --> 21:17.912
Well, then it's a good thing
that you got in
to Hudson University,

21:17.912 --> 21:20.214
your dream choice.

21:20.214 --> 21:22.283
So just figure out
the housing situation
and there you go.

21:22.283 --> 21:24.785
There I don't go!
You have to help me!

21:24.785 --> 21:26.020
I did help you.

21:26.020 --> 21:28.055
I helped you in.

21:28.055 --> 21:29.223
I'm not a realtor.

21:29.223 --> 21:31.191
But we'll talk
when you get back.

21:32.393 --> 21:33.494
(DISCONNECTS)

21:33.494 --> 21:35.195
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

21:39.099 --> 21:41.035
Hi, there.

21:41.035 --> 21:44.204
I have a car out front
and at the last minute
I felt too guilty

21:44.204 --> 21:46.206
to pretend that I didn't
know what flight you were
going out on,

21:46.206 --> 21:48.175
so I thought I'd offer
you a ride.

21:48.175 --> 21:50.210
I'm not interested.
I'll get a taxi.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.384
Better save your money
for an apartment.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.120
You too.
Oh, I got
a dorm room.

22:01.322 --> 22:04.458
Do you know how much
these stupid dorm rooms cost?

22:04.458 --> 22:06.360
Yeah, 15 to 20 grand.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.163
You would pay that much
to live in a shoe box?

22:09.163 --> 22:11.765
Well, I'm getting
an apartment too, I hope.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.101
Are you actually going to
come to school here?

22:14.101 --> 22:17.171
And get an apartment
and a dorm room
in Manhattan?

22:17.171 --> 22:19.139
Ben, that's ridiculous!

22:19.139 --> 22:21.475
Just stop,
like, stop it right now.

22:21.475 --> 22:23.277
You have no interest
in going to school here.

22:23.277 --> 22:24.745
Oh, but I do.

22:24.745 --> 22:27.047
Me? Is that what interests you
in going here? Me?

22:27.047 --> 22:31.318
You and I had a great time
here, I like the city,
I like the school,

22:31.318 --> 22:33.020
and, hey, why not?

22:33.020 --> 22:34.788
Because I don't want you
to go to school here!

22:34.788 --> 22:37.891
Oh, grow up Amy. There are
thousands of students
at this school

22:37.891 --> 22:39.393
and millions of people
in New York.

22:39.393 --> 22:41.829
We probably won't even
run into each other
all that often.

22:41.829 --> 22:43.263
Ricky would never
be comfortable

22:43.263 --> 22:46.066
with my coming to school here
if you're here.

22:46.066 --> 22:49.136
I can't just hit him up
with you and ask for money
at the same time!

22:49.136 --> 22:51.005
If you were really
in love with Ricky

22:51.005 --> 22:52.773
and you cared
what he thought,

22:52.773 --> 22:56.043
you wouldn't even consider
leaving him to come
to school here.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.045
Actually, yeah, I would.

22:58.045 --> 23:02.182
And I am considering that,
which doesn't mean
I don't love him!

23:02.182 --> 23:06.020
And he and John
can't stay with me
in the dorm

23:06.020 --> 23:08.055
and we can't
afford an apartment,

23:08.055 --> 23:11.325
and we can't afford
getting a hotel
every time they come.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.062
So, just go ahead,
here, take it!

23:15.062 --> 23:16.864
Take my school,
take my dream!

23:16.864 --> 23:18.265
Your dream was gone
when I met you.

23:19.299 --> 23:21.468
Ben!
What?

23:21.468 --> 23:24.071
You knew your life plans
were completely wrecked
when you got pregnant.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.774
However, if you'd like
to go to school here,

23:26.774 --> 23:29.910
you can go to school here.
No one is stopping you.

23:29.910 --> 23:33.213
It might just be a little bit
harder than you thought
it would be.

23:33.213 --> 23:36.784
But, as always, I'm sure
you'll find a way
to get what you want.

23:36.784 --> 23:38.819
Hey, maybe your dad
can help you.

23:38.819 --> 23:40.354
My dad can't afford
to help me.

23:40.354 --> 23:42.022
He has money,
he just bought a restaurant!

23:42.022 --> 23:44.358
(LAUGHS) A restaurant?
Are you kidding?

23:44.358 --> 23:47.795
He just bought
Geoff's restaurant.
My dad?

23:47.795 --> 23:51.131
You haven't talked to him
since you've been here?

23:51.131 --> 23:52.533
No, I have, yeah.

23:52.533 --> 23:54.301
Maybe he wanted
to tell you in person.

23:54.301 --> 23:56.236
Here. Come on,
we'll talk about it
in the car.

23:56.236 --> 23:59.041
No. I will just take a taxi.

23:59.041 --> 24:02.911
(SIGHS)
It's a free ride,
take it.

24:02.911 --> 24:05.113
We're going to be
sitting next to each other
on the flight anyway.

24:08.417 --> 24:09.418
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

24:11.453 --> 24:13.221
How was lunch?
Boring.

24:14.256 --> 24:16.191
What are you doing there,

24:16.191 --> 24:17.893
actually reading
a newspaper?

24:17.893 --> 24:20.495
Looking for an apartment.

24:20.495 --> 24:22.164
I thought you were
going to get a car first?

24:22.164 --> 24:25.734
Nah, I should just do it,
get out.

24:25.734 --> 24:27.869
Why are you in such a hurry
all of a sudden?

24:27.869 --> 24:30.038
We're going to
have to move anyway,
so, it's time.

24:30.906 --> 24:32.040
That's not it.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.275
I don't want to tell you.

24:33.275 --> 24:35.377
If you tell me,
maybe I can help you.

24:35.377 --> 24:38.213
I told Ricky not to marry Amy
and now I feel guilty

24:38.213 --> 24:41.850
living there with
Amy's dad in Amy's
mother's house for free.

24:41.850 --> 24:43.018
You should move.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.722
Yeah, I knew that.

24:47.155 --> 24:48.824
(DISCONNECTS)

24:48.824 --> 24:50.792
Don finally got back with me.

24:50.792 --> 24:52.294
He's coming over
after school.

24:52.294 --> 24:53.862
Great. I'll help you
talk to him.

24:53.862 --> 24:57.733
Oh, uh, thanks, but my dad
told me to talk to him.

24:57.733 --> 25:01.303
Well, I should be there.
Just in case.

25:01.303 --> 25:04.172
I appreciate your
being willing to help me,

25:04.172 --> 25:08.110
but I think I should
handle this by myself,
like a responsible adult.

25:08.110 --> 25:09.811
And my grandmother is home
if I screw it up

25:09.811 --> 25:11.713
and don't handle it
like a responsible adult.

25:11.713 --> 25:15.016
Good, but I should
be there too.

25:15.016 --> 25:16.351
Ethan, my dad said...

25:16.351 --> 25:17.819
Your dad loves me.

25:17.819 --> 25:20.088
And we've bonded now,
we're both bad at algebra.

25:20.088 --> 25:23.725
That doesn't mean you
should be part of what is
a very important conversation

25:23.725 --> 25:26.228
between two people
regarding a child.

25:26.228 --> 25:27.963
Yes, it does.

25:27.963 --> 25:29.264
You believe everything
this guy says,

25:29.264 --> 25:30.832
you're not going to
get anywhere with him.

25:30.832 --> 25:32.267
Yes, I am.

25:32.267 --> 25:34.002
You never would have even
figured this out without me.

25:34.002 --> 25:35.470
You're right about that.
Thank you.

25:35.470 --> 25:37.272
"Thank you," but?

25:37.272 --> 25:40.308
No buts, I mean it.
Thank you.

25:40.308 --> 25:42.144
You can't cut me out now.

25:42.144 --> 25:44.012
Come on, Kathy,
I'm your boyfriend,

25:44.012 --> 25:45.213
I'm looking out for you.

25:45.213 --> 25:46.782
I can look out for me.

25:46.782 --> 25:48.450
You can,
but this guy is slick,
and you know it.

25:48.450 --> 25:50.752
I know,

25:50.752 --> 25:53.855
but deep down inside,
Don is a nice guy

25:53.855 --> 25:55.991
and I don't want to
embarrass him.

25:55.991 --> 25:58.760
I just want him to go home
and never bother me again,

25:58.760 --> 26:01.329
and never bother Jonathan
and Sonya again.

26:01.329 --> 26:03.965
So, I'm going to be
as nice as I can
about this.

26:03.965 --> 26:05.300
You are so naive!

26:05.300 --> 26:07.235
Nice only works
on nice people.

26:07.235 --> 26:09.004
He's after money!
He's not nice.

26:09.004 --> 26:10.906
He can be.

26:10.906 --> 26:14.876
Look, Don made some
regrettable calls
and flew out here

26:16.378 --> 26:19.247
and I'm sure he
regrets doing this
and he's embarrassed.

26:19.247 --> 26:20.816
I'll talk to him
and it'll be fine.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.885
I'll see you at my house.

26:36.398 --> 26:38.366
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

26:44.306 --> 26:46.274
Hello.
Hey, Grace.

26:46.274 --> 26:49.277
Jack! It's so good
to hear from you.
I've missed you.

26:49.277 --> 26:50.912
Yeah, I've missed
you too, Grace.

26:50.912 --> 26:53.448
I heard that you saw
Dr. Fields last night

26:53.448 --> 26:55.250
and then you spent the night
at your parents' house?

26:55.250 --> 26:57.719
Adrian?
(CHUCKLES) Of course.

26:57.719 --> 26:59.788
I thought you two
weren't friends anymore.

26:59.788 --> 27:01.923
Well, the easiest way
to make friends with someone
is to ask them for their help.

27:01.923 --> 27:03.992
So, I just asked her
for some help.

27:05.327 --> 27:06.761
How are you?
What are you doing?

27:06.761 --> 27:08.208
I'm just thinking
about something

27:08.208 --> 27:10.978
and wanted
your thoughts on it.
What's that?

27:10.978 --> 27:13.647
Well, I don't want to
bother you if you're in
the middle of something.

27:13.647 --> 27:16.316
No. I'm just grabbing a coffee
and then I'm on the way
to the airport.

27:16.316 --> 27:17.951
So, ask me.

27:17.951 --> 27:20.053
This lawyer came
to see me today

27:20.053 --> 27:23.123
and he said I could
sue the school
and make millions of dollars

27:23.123 --> 27:24.291
and they wouldn't
have to pay it,

27:24.291 --> 27:25.793
it would be
their insurance company.

27:25.793 --> 27:28.262
What?
Yeah, millions of dollars.

27:28.262 --> 27:29.797
For what?

27:29.797 --> 27:31.999
They paid for all
your hospital bills,

27:31.999 --> 27:33.133
and they let you keep
your scholarship

27:33.133 --> 27:34.334
even though you're
not playing football,

27:34.334 --> 27:36.670
and your dorm room
is still available to you.

27:36.670 --> 27:39.139
Yeah, because they know
they owe me something
for what I went through.

27:39.139 --> 27:41.175
And I may never be able
to play football again.

27:41.175 --> 27:42.409
You're getting
your casts off soon,

27:42.409 --> 27:44.812
you're going to be
working out in a few weeks,

27:44.812 --> 27:47.314
and then
starting physical therapy.
You're going to be fine.

27:47.314 --> 27:49.183
You are fine!

27:49.183 --> 27:51.251
Whatever happened
to the miracle of the bones?

27:51.251 --> 27:53.320
Even if I am fine,
look at everything
I've been through.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.621
They owe me
something for that.

27:54.621 --> 27:57.658
Whatever happened to
happy to be alive

27:57.658 --> 28:00.794
and grateful that God
saw you through
all this, etcetera, etcetera?

28:00.794 --> 28:03.030
I am happy to be alive
and I'd be really happy

28:03.030 --> 28:04.898
even to get a couple
million dollars.

28:04.898 --> 28:06.400
I could even buy
my parents a house.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.669
With money you get
from suing the university?

28:08.669 --> 28:10.137
They have insurance.
Oh, even so.

28:10.137 --> 28:13.674
It just doesn't strike me
as the right thing to do.

28:13.674 --> 28:16.376
I mean, suppose
that the court does find
the school negligent

28:16.376 --> 28:19.246
in protecting you
and people lose
their jobs and...

28:19.246 --> 28:22.049
Maybe they'll create
more jobs. Maybe they'll
hire more security.

28:22.049 --> 28:23.717
They should hire
more security.

28:23.717 --> 28:25.619
I'm actually doing
a public service

28:25.619 --> 28:27.254
by forcing them
to behave more responsibly.

28:27.254 --> 28:29.022
I don't know, Jack.

28:29.022 --> 28:31.258
It sounds as if you
might be trying to justify
taking money

28:31.258 --> 28:33.760
that maybe you shouldn't.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.629
I mean, you're
the victim of a crime.

28:35.629 --> 28:37.231
But I don't know if you're
the victim of the school

28:37.231 --> 28:39.399
being negligent
in protecting you,
are you?

28:39.399 --> 28:41.101
It's millions of dollars.

28:41.101 --> 28:43.203
I think you should
think about it.
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

28:43.203 --> 28:45.339
Oh, hold on.
I have another call.

28:47.140 --> 28:48.342
Um, it's Adrian.

28:48.342 --> 28:49.943
I'm going to be
home tomorrow,

28:49.943 --> 28:51.645
so let's talk about it more,
then, okay?

28:51.645 --> 28:53.714
I love you.
I love you, Grace.

28:55.349 --> 28:58.185
Hi.
Hey, are you home?

28:58.185 --> 29:00.787
Not yet. I'm in Denver,
I'm going to be home
in a few hours.

29:00.787 --> 29:02.322
I can't wait to see Jack.

29:02.322 --> 29:04.758
Thank you so much
for everything that you did.

29:05.792 --> 29:07.327
Omar is leaving me!
What?

29:07.327 --> 29:11.031
(SIGHS) This company
he works for wants him
in New York.

29:11.031 --> 29:13.033
He, Ben and Amy
are going to New York.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.835
But he's going to
take you with him, right?

29:14.835 --> 29:16.203
He asked me to go with him,

29:16.203 --> 29:19.172
but I can't go
without totally losing

29:19.172 --> 29:22.809
all the credits
for this year and giving up
this condo.

29:24.344 --> 29:25.879
I love this condo.

29:25.879 --> 29:27.848
Well, Adrian, the condo's
not really yours.

29:27.848 --> 29:32.152
You only live there
because Leo Boykewich
is an incredibly generous man,

29:32.152 --> 29:35.689
but you were always going to
leave that condo behind
anyway at some point,

29:35.689 --> 29:37.157
and you'll always
have Omar.

29:37.157 --> 29:38.892
I am so crazy.

29:40.260 --> 29:44.131
I forgot this isn't mine.
It isn't mine at all.

29:44.131 --> 29:47.134
Wait. So, that's it?
Amy and Ben are going
to New York to school?

29:47.134 --> 29:48.268
(SIGHS) I don't know.

29:48.268 --> 29:50.237
I think she'll stay
in California.

29:50.237 --> 29:52.272
She loves Ricky
and she loves John.

29:52.272 --> 29:54.675
And she loves Amy
more than she loves
anyone else.

29:54.675 --> 29:56.877
(SIGHS) I don't know,
maybe that's not so bad.

29:58.211 --> 29:59.246
How's it going with you?

29:59.246 --> 30:01.415
Any of the schools
look good?

30:01.415 --> 30:04.184
Yeah. I think I just needed
to step away from Jack
for a little bit

30:04.184 --> 30:06.019
to see how I really feel
about him.

30:06.019 --> 30:08.155
And?
And I really do love him.

30:09.623 --> 30:11.224
But?
But...

30:11.224 --> 30:14.194
How did we get more interested
in guys than ourselves?

30:14.194 --> 30:15.228
Sex.

30:18.098 --> 30:20.200
Uh, okay, yeah.
Grace, I have to go.

30:21.101 --> 30:22.336
Hey.
Hi.

30:24.271 --> 30:25.939
I didn't know you were here.

30:25.939 --> 30:27.908
Yeah, I took a nap,
I'm a little jet lagged.

30:27.908 --> 30:31.311
So, how did you get
more interested in guys
than yourselves?

30:33.246 --> 30:35.248
Grace says it was sex.

30:35.248 --> 30:37.150
And you agree?
No.

30:37.150 --> 30:38.719
What do you say it was?

30:38.719 --> 30:40.721
Low self-esteem.

30:40.721 --> 30:43.390
You don't really
strike me as a woman
who has low self-esteem.

30:43.390 --> 30:46.893
Yeah, having this attitude
didn't come easy.

30:46.893 --> 30:49.129
So what do you want to do?

30:49.129 --> 30:54.101
Stay here and live
in a condo paid for by
your ex-husband's dad

30:54.101 --> 30:58.138
or go with me,
your future husband?

30:59.106 --> 31:01.875
What I want to do

31:04.111 --> 31:07.280
is be my own person
for once in my life.

31:12.152 --> 31:13.854
What are you going to do
if he doesn't show?

31:13.854 --> 31:15.222
He said he's on his way.

31:15.222 --> 31:16.390
He said that
an hour ago.

31:16.390 --> 31:18.191
He'll be here.

31:18.191 --> 31:20.093
Maybe it's good he's late.

31:20.093 --> 31:22.963
Put him on the defensive,
start strong.

31:22.963 --> 31:25.332
Just let me handle it,
the way I want to handle it.

31:25.332 --> 31:27.234
I may not want
to start strong.

31:27.234 --> 31:28.902
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

31:35.142 --> 31:36.910
How could you think
this is about money?

31:43.784 --> 31:46.119
You had your dad call my
parents?

31:46.119 --> 31:48.889
I didn't really
want them involved.
We're adults.

31:48.889 --> 31:50.857
We had a baby.

31:50.857 --> 31:53.760
We don't need our parents
to get involved
in our business.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.096
Our parents
or your boyfriend.

31:56.096 --> 31:58.832
I just thought that...
That I wanted money?

31:58.832 --> 32:00.767
I never asked anyone
for any money.

32:00.767 --> 32:04.071
You said you needed money
for college, so...
So what?

32:04.071 --> 32:07.741
I would risk getting caught
blackmailing someone
to pay tuition?

32:07.741 --> 32:10.877
Not just blackmailing someone,
but blackmailing them
over a child?

32:10.877 --> 32:12.646
You think I'm stupid
all of a sudden?

32:14.114 --> 32:15.115
What happened to you?

32:16.817 --> 32:20.253
Never mind.
I know what happened.

32:20.253 --> 32:23.824
You're hanging out with
that juvenile delinquent
and listening to him.

32:23.824 --> 32:25.792
Well...
Well, that's my daughter

32:26.693 --> 32:28.228
and I wanted to see her.

32:29.229 --> 32:30.831
You got to see her
when she was born.

32:30.831 --> 32:33.667
Yeah, I birthed her.

32:35.458 --> 32:36.459
Your part was easy.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.959
And what, you're just
curious?

32:39.959 --> 32:41.041
You're going to
see her and then,

32:41.041 --> 32:43.543
a few months later
or next year, you're
going to be curious again?

32:43.543 --> 32:45.612
And her parents should just
have to live with that?

32:45.612 --> 32:47.881
And when she gets older,
she should have to live
with that?

32:47.881 --> 32:49.849
When she gets older,
she may want to know me.

32:49.849 --> 32:53.553
She might.
And if she does, I'm sure
her parents will find you.

32:54.988 --> 32:57.490
But she might not.

32:57.490 --> 33:00.160
Again, there's only so much
you contributed to her life.

33:01.161 --> 33:03.496
Your contribution
was microscopic.

33:03.496 --> 33:04.497
Couldn't have happened
without me.

33:06.599 --> 33:07.600
No.

33:08.902 --> 33:09.903
It couldn't have.

33:11.237 --> 33:13.506
I'm sorry.

33:13.506 --> 33:15.208
That's the first time
you've said that to me,
you know that?

33:16.242 --> 33:17.510
Well...

33:18.611 --> 33:19.846
I am sorry.

33:23.650 --> 33:25.585
This is all your fault!
My fault?

33:25.585 --> 33:27.554
You never should have accused
him of wanting money.

33:27.554 --> 33:29.089
Now he's going to
make her feel guilty about it

33:29.089 --> 33:30.623
and then he's going
to walk away

33:30.623 --> 33:32.459
with her wanting to be friends
with him or something.

33:32.459 --> 33:34.561
I still say
he wants money.
(SIGHS)

33:34.561 --> 33:36.129
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Stubborn!

33:36.129 --> 33:38.498
I don't buy what
he's doing in there.
It's completely insincere.

33:38.498 --> 33:39.799
He's just saying this
'cause he got busted.

33:39.799 --> 33:42.068
We lost the element
of surprise.
Her dad blew it.

33:42.068 --> 33:45.171
He should have waited to call
his parents until Kathy got
a shot at him.

33:45.171 --> 33:46.606
He messed up everything.

33:46.606 --> 33:49.709
I don't like this Don.
Me neither.

33:49.709 --> 33:51.544
I am absolutely certain
that I was right about him.

33:52.612 --> 33:53.747
I'm gonna call her dad.

33:53.747 --> 33:55.548
Oh, I don't know if you
should do that.

33:56.483 --> 33:57.684
He's probably sleeping.

33:57.684 --> 33:58.818
C'est la vie.

33:58.818 --> 33:59.819
(SIGHS)

34:01.821 --> 34:03.556
Could I possibly
borrow your phone?

34:03.556 --> 34:04.758
I don't have
international service.

34:11.097 --> 34:13.566
No wonder you can't sleep,

34:13.566 --> 34:15.702
you need to get up
and move around.

34:15.702 --> 34:17.804
You can either go down
to the gym and work out

34:17.804 --> 34:20.874
or help your mother around
the house or help me with some
yard work

34:20.874 --> 34:23.843
or maybe go look for a job.

34:23.843 --> 34:25.578
I don't know what I'd do
at the gym.

34:25.578 --> 34:27.013
I'm sure there's
something you could do.

34:27.013 --> 34:28.214
One-handed weight lifting?

34:28.214 --> 34:29.916
Yeah, do that.

34:29.916 --> 34:31.584
People don't do that.

34:31.584 --> 34:34.487
It's bad enough the arm
in the cast is going
to be a twig,

34:34.487 --> 34:36.523
I don't want to
build the other one up.

34:36.523 --> 34:39.993
Okay, well, wax the kitchen
floors,

34:39.993 --> 34:41.227
you used to be good at that.

34:41.227 --> 34:42.762
And if I slip and fall?

34:42.762 --> 34:43.797
Then you can sue me.

34:44.564 --> 34:45.899
Or me and your mother.

34:49.836 --> 34:52.238
Grace called.

34:52.238 --> 34:54.474
Now, she's worried
about your suing the school.

34:54.474 --> 34:57.477
I assured her you are not
suing the school.

34:57.477 --> 35:00.180
If you want to sue the guy
who did that to you, sue him.

35:00.180 --> 35:02.615
When they find him.
And eventually
they will find him.

35:02.615 --> 35:04.617
But you are not suing
your university,

35:04.617 --> 35:06.586
where you have a scholarship

35:06.586 --> 35:09.155
and where the coaches
and the athletes have done
nothing but help you out.

35:09.155 --> 35:12.959
It's not personal, it's their
insurance company.

35:12.959 --> 35:15.462
So everyone at the school
would share in the cost?

35:15.462 --> 35:17.063
Students, faculty, everyone?

35:17.063 --> 35:18.565
Well, I don't look
at it like that.

35:18.565 --> 35:20.500
Well, look at it like that.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.001
And just what do you need
the money for?

35:22.001 --> 35:24.838
It's not that I need it.
I mean, I need it,
we all need it,

35:24.838 --> 35:26.005
it's a matter of principle.

35:26.005 --> 35:28.608
Yeah, it is.
And where are your principles?

35:28.608 --> 35:29.909
Dad.

35:29.909 --> 35:31.044
Jack.

35:31.044 --> 35:32.745
I wanted to buy you
a new house.

35:32.745 --> 35:34.247
I don't need you to buy
me a new house.

35:34.247 --> 35:35.815
I like this house.

35:35.815 --> 35:38.718
If we want a new house,
we'll buy a new house.

35:38.718 --> 35:40.453
I don't need anything,

35:40.453 --> 35:41.988
other than for you
to recover.

35:41.988 --> 35:43.690
But I have recovered.

35:43.690 --> 35:45.725
I'm just waiting
for the casts to come off,

35:45.725 --> 35:48.995
and when they do, would it be
so bad if I went driving
around in a red Porsche?

35:48.995 --> 35:51.631
While the guys who came
to visit you at the hospital
every day

35:51.631 --> 35:54.067
carpooled and took the bus?
Are you kidding?

35:54.067 --> 35:56.136
I don't know.
It didn't seem that unfair

35:56.136 --> 35:57.937
when the lawyer
was explaining it.

35:57.937 --> 36:00.840
Are you going to listen to me
or some lawyer you met today?

36:00.840 --> 36:03.977
Well, you're not offering me
millions of dollars.
That's a lot of money.

36:03.977 --> 36:06.579
Okay, first of all,
the lawyer would take half

36:06.579 --> 36:08.982
and you'd have to pay taxes,
so it's not as much as
it seems,

36:08.982 --> 36:12.051
but secondly,
it's dirty money.

36:12.051 --> 36:14.954
I mean, how do you go
around proclaiming
yourself a Christian

36:14.954 --> 36:16.990
and then consider robbing
an insurance company?

36:16.990 --> 36:20.059
I'm not robbing anyone
and why can't a Christian sue?

36:20.059 --> 36:23.663
I mean, I brought that up with
the attorney, about me not
suing because I'm a Christian.

36:23.663 --> 36:26.065
And he said...
"What, are all Christians
doormats?"

36:27.667 --> 36:31.137
Dad, I was a really good
athlete with a promising
pro career.

36:31.137 --> 36:33.740
Now I'm just an injured
athlete trying to recover

36:33.740 --> 36:36.667
and I'm only an average
student in college.

36:37.868 --> 36:39.036
What am I gonna do
to earn a living?

36:39.036 --> 36:40.671
How am I ever going
to support Grace?

36:41.472 --> 36:43.507
I need that money.

36:43.507 --> 36:44.842
How am I gonna get it?

36:44.842 --> 36:47.845
Well, you're not just gonna
go around suing people.

36:47.845 --> 36:50.814
And I've always told you
not to rely on being
a professional athlete

36:50.814 --> 36:52.382
because one day
you could get injured.

36:53.117 --> 36:54.451
What's your B plan, Jack?

36:55.152 --> 36:57.387
Uh, choose a major?

37:05.028 --> 37:08.065
Your presence
is required at work!

37:08.065 --> 37:10.134
Okay, I'm sorry.
I got distracted.

37:10.134 --> 37:12.803
Yesterday you weren't here,
today you're somewhere else.

37:12.803 --> 37:14.705
What the hell is going on?

37:14.705 --> 37:16.106
Amy wants to go to school
in New York.

37:16.106 --> 37:17.975
And that relates
to sausage how?

37:17.975 --> 37:19.676
It does relate.
I'm trying to figure out
how much I have to make

37:19.676 --> 37:21.712
to cover John's daycare
if he stays here with me

37:21.712 --> 37:23.447
and Amy goes
to Hudson University.

37:23.447 --> 37:26.150
Uh, you two are getting
married or splitting up?

37:26.150 --> 37:28.919
We're getting married and then
splitting up to go to school,
I think.

37:28.919 --> 37:30.954
If she wants.
What?

37:30.954 --> 37:33.157
Amy really wants to be married
but she really wants to go
to Hudson University,

37:33.157 --> 37:34.992
that was always her dream.

37:34.992 --> 37:37.060
So, I'm trying to figure out
how to make that work for her.

37:37.060 --> 37:40.030
What do they teach at
that New York school
that they don't teach here?

37:40.030 --> 37:43.066
Isn't the purpose
of an education
to get an education?

37:43.066 --> 37:45.536
Not to live in another city
and have a good time.

37:45.536 --> 37:48.071
I just want her to have
what she wants.

37:48.071 --> 37:50.807
So that you can have what you
want, which is to be married.

37:50.807 --> 37:53.043
I want to feel satisfied
that I have made every effort

37:53.043 --> 37:55.412
to make this
relationship work out.

37:55.412 --> 37:57.548
Well, that's pretty much what
someone says when they want

37:57.548 --> 37:59.716
out of a relationship
without any guilt.

37:59.716 --> 38:02.152
No, I, uh...
You, uh, what?

38:02.152 --> 38:04.588
I'm just trying to do my best
for everyone.

38:04.588 --> 38:06.890
For Amy, for John, for myself.

38:06.890 --> 38:08.926
And if I can figure out
this financially

38:08.926 --> 38:11.862
and that's what Amy wants
to do, go to school in
New York, then she should go,

38:11.862 --> 38:14.565
(SIGHS)
Otherwise, I will feel guilty

38:14.565 --> 38:16.466
for not making it happen
for her.

38:16.466 --> 38:18.936
And she'll regret not going
and I'll be blamed the rest
of our lives.

38:18.936 --> 38:20.804
Wow.

38:20.804 --> 38:23.574
If that's really what you
think then, (WHISPERS)
just let it go.

38:23.574 --> 38:25.842
Do get married.

38:25.842 --> 38:29.379
Put the closing sign
in the door
and call it a night!

38:36.153 --> 38:38.655
You don't have to call them.
You're right.

38:38.655 --> 38:40.023
I just got emotional.

38:41.058 --> 38:44.928
I think I was just
missing you.

38:44.928 --> 38:48.632
I should be the one to call
Jonathan and Sonya
and apologize.

38:48.632 --> 38:50.601
I really wasn't after
their money.

38:50.601 --> 38:53.170
Yeah, I didn't think
you were.

38:53.170 --> 38:56.506
I heard your boyfriend came
out with you and talked
to your mom and dad

38:56.506 --> 38:57.808
into letting you come
back here.

38:59.543 --> 39:01.712
And Kathy,

39:01.712 --> 39:04.414
I was counting on you
to come back from Houston.

39:04.414 --> 39:06.583
But I hadn't even heard
from you.

39:06.583 --> 39:08.819
I didn't want to upset you.

39:08.819 --> 39:13.090
You know, your getting
pregnant and having a baby
and...

39:13.991 --> 39:15.559
Having the baby adopted.

39:15.559 --> 39:16.994
That didn't just affect you,

39:17.661 --> 39:19.496
it affected me, too.

39:19.496 --> 39:21.865
I've been really
depressed and...

39:23.533 --> 39:25.569
Angry at myself.

39:25.569 --> 39:28.138
And then, well,
I got angry at everyone.

39:29.773 --> 39:31.908
I know I wouldn't
make a good father.

39:31.908 --> 39:34.077
Well, not right now, but...

39:35.545 --> 39:36.546
Maybe someday.

39:36.546 --> 39:37.981
I don't know.

39:37.981 --> 39:42.819
I mean, how could I do
something so stupid?

39:42.819 --> 39:44.521
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY))

39:44.521 --> 39:46.690
It was a tough situation.

39:46.690 --> 39:49.493
I really prepared to let go
of her and...

39:49.493 --> 39:51.428
I guess you didn't get
to do that.

39:51.428 --> 39:52.896
No, I... I didn't.

39:54.865 --> 39:58.568
And I am just a little curious
to see what she looks like.

39:58.568 --> 40:00.937
Well, I'm sure they'd send
you a picture, but...

40:02.472 --> 40:05.442
I think it's best
to just let go,

40:06.510 --> 40:07.711
for the baby's sake.

40:07.711 --> 40:10.514
You're right,
and I'm going to do that.

40:11.815 --> 40:12.816
Thank you, Don.

40:14.951 --> 40:16.453
I better be going.

40:16.453 --> 40:19.990
All right.
Mind if I call you once
in a while?

40:19.990 --> 40:22.426
I guess once in a while
would be okay.

40:22.426 --> 40:24.394
Bye. Have a safe
flight back.

40:26.496 --> 40:30.434
Hi, um, Kathy, if you don't
mind, I'd like to speak
to Don,

40:30.434 --> 40:32.069
apologize for
the misunderstanding.

40:32.536 --> 40:33.537
Alone.

40:34.571 --> 40:35.672
Sure.

40:43.146 --> 40:46.049
Look, I'm sorry if there
was a misunderstanding.

40:46.049 --> 40:48.385
Yeah, whatever.

40:48.385 --> 40:51.054
I guess I thought that since
you said your dad wouldn't
give you money for college

40:51.054 --> 40:52.923
you were looking to get
a little something.

40:52.923 --> 40:55.425
No, I'm not looking for this
couple to do

40:55.425 --> 40:56.860
what my dad should do
for me.

40:56.860 --> 40:58.929
Yeah.

40:58.929 --> 41:01.164
But frankly, I thought they
should have paid Kathy

41:01.164 --> 41:02.833
something for her trouble,
don't you?

41:02.833 --> 41:04.935
I mean, the birth alone was,
let me tell you...

41:06.069 --> 41:07.771
You don't want
to give birth.

41:07.771 --> 41:08.772
It's so...

41:09.506 --> 41:10.774
Well, unnatural.

41:11.575 --> 41:13.410
And she suffered.

41:13.410 --> 41:16.446
She had to move here,
go to a new school,
change her whole life,

41:16.446 --> 41:19.449
and all that time, she was
going to doctors appointments

41:19.449 --> 41:21.418
and birthing classes and...

41:21.418 --> 41:24.154
She just felt so guilty
and ashamed.

41:24.154 --> 41:25.756
She has nothing to show
for all this.

41:27.090 --> 41:29.726
And, well, as a guy,
I have to say,

41:29.726 --> 41:32.129
you have nothing to show
for it either,

41:32.129 --> 41:33.864
other than your reputation
is shot.

41:33.864 --> 41:35.499
Or not.

41:35.499 --> 41:38.068
I just think that Kathy should
have been compensated,

41:38.068 --> 41:40.670
I mean, her dad covered
all the expenses.

41:40.670 --> 41:43.407
Why should he have covered
all the expenses?

41:43.407 --> 41:45.509
And why shouldn't
she get something
from this couple?

41:45.509 --> 41:47.778
She gave them a baby,
she changed their lives.

41:47.778 --> 41:50.380
She and I changed their lives.

41:50.380 --> 41:51.948
Right, right.
So...

41:51.948 --> 41:54.151
You can't ask for money
in exchange for what you did,

41:54.151 --> 41:56.686
but surely they could have
gifted you something.

41:56.686 --> 41:59.089
Gifted?
Well that's not against the
law to say,

41:59.089 --> 42:01.091
"Thank you very much,
here's 50 grand."

42:01.091 --> 42:04.394
Yeah, that's not against
the law.

42:05.429 --> 42:07.063
And it's the right thing
to do.

42:07.063 --> 42:09.599
I mean, the lawyer got a fee,

42:09.599 --> 42:11.034
the doctors all got paid,

42:12.035 --> 42:13.837
why not Kathy and me?

42:13.837 --> 42:15.772
Yeah, why not?

42:15.772 --> 42:18.008
I just couldn't figure out
how to go about it.

42:18.008 --> 42:21.144
I was gonna visit
the baby, drop a few hints,
hope they offered.

42:22.045 --> 42:23.780
I knew I couldn't ask them.

42:24.448 --> 42:25.449
Got you.

42:26.650 --> 42:27.918
I knew it was about money.

42:28.652 --> 42:29.920
You tricked me.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.423
Yeah, I did.
And you fell for it.

42:33.423 --> 42:35.892
I'm surprised a good speller
would be so...

42:35.892 --> 42:37.661
Stupid?
I didn't say that.

42:37.661 --> 42:39.996
But I am having a good day
in terms of finding out
that people

42:39.996 --> 42:42.632
are no smarter than I am.
So, for that, I thank you.

42:42.632 --> 42:43.700
And I bid you adieu.

42:44.935 --> 42:46.470
Don't let the door hit you
in the butt,

42:46.470 --> 42:47.938
and don't be showing
your face around here again.

42:47.938 --> 42:49.573
Or at the adoptive couple's.

42:49.573 --> 42:51.942
I could care less about you

42:51.942 --> 42:54.678
or Kathy or that adoptive
couple anyway.

43:04.721 --> 43:06.656
You're a genius.

43:06.656 --> 43:09.092
Integers are positive
and negative whole numbers.

43:09.092 --> 43:13.625
Two even consecutive
integers that equal twenty-six
would be twelve and fourteen.
