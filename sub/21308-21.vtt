WEBVTT

00:52.291 --> 00:55.871
Is this the doorbell or...

00:55.871 --> 00:57.871
[loud buzzer
and whinnying]

00:57.871 --> 00:59.411
Oh, what did I do?

00:59.411 --> 01:01.001
What are you doing?

01:01.001 --> 01:03.751
Uh, I'm sorry.
I just rang the doorbell.

01:03.751 --> 01:06.081
That's not a doorbell.
I'll come down and get you.

01:06.081 --> 01:08.831
Oh, my gosh, Star!

01:08.831 --> 01:11.671
Pony Head!
Good to see you, girl.

01:11.671 --> 01:13.711
Check out
what I brought.

01:13.711 --> 01:15.501
Oh, my goodness!

01:15.501 --> 01:18.251
That is the finest
casserole I have
ever seen, girl.

01:18.251 --> 01:21.911
Maybe this night might not
be a total disaster after all.

01:21.911 --> 01:23.911
Right

01:23.911 --> 01:26.831
I've been trying to spare
you from my sisters,
I really have,

01:26.831 --> 01:28.711
but at this point,
I need back-up.

01:28.711 --> 01:30.911
What? They've always
been so nice to me.

01:30.911 --> 01:33.041
You do not know them
like I do, Star.

01:33.041 --> 01:35.331
They're like
peanut butter and jealous.

01:35.331 --> 01:37.081
They have been trying
to take me down for years,

01:37.081 --> 01:39.751
all because I'm
next in line for the throne.

01:39.751 --> 01:42.751
Not to mention that
I'm so beautiful
and talented and humble.

01:42.751 --> 01:44.831
Oh, Pony Head.

01:44.831 --> 01:46.961
- I'm sure
they're not that bad.
- Star, look at me.

01:46.961 --> 01:50.581
They are long-faced,
two-faced monsters.

01:50.581 --> 01:52.961
All right,
listen up, people.

01:52.961 --> 01:55.791
Okay, my friend Star
is here for our meal,

01:55.791 --> 01:57.711
and we are going
to act like normal,

01:57.711 --> 02:01.081
like a normal family
that spends time together.

02:01.081 --> 02:02.791
Like normal.

02:05.211 --> 02:06.791
Hey, Azniss. No.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.331
Okay, that is
not normal.

02:08.331 --> 02:10.331
This is what I'm
talking about, people.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.461
Oh, no, it's fine.

02:12.461 --> 02:14.791
You guys don't have to do
anything special for me.

02:14.791 --> 02:17.371
Just act like
I'm not even here.

02:19.671 --> 02:23.461
Pony Head, I forgot
everyone's names.

02:23.461 --> 02:25.751
Oh, hey, Star forgot
y'all's names.

02:28.291 --> 02:30.291
- Roll call!

02:30.291 --> 02:32.621
- Baby Pranciss.
- Hornanne.
- Jen-Jen.

02:32.621 --> 02:33.911
- Pamanda.
- Khrystalle.

02:33.911 --> 02:36.001
- Angel.
- Azniss.

02:36.001 --> 02:38.671
No! Get back to
the table right now!

02:38.671 --> 02:41.671
You don't introduce yourselves
with a musical number.

02:41.671 --> 02:44.461
You say your name.
Just say your name.

02:44.461 --> 02:46.911
Where are the twins?
Shonda and Shinda.

02:48.871 --> 02:51.751
Yes?
- Get your creepy
selves over here.

02:51.751 --> 02:53.581
You guys
are so weird.

02:53.581 --> 02:55.411
Ugh! Are we ready
to eat?

02:55.411 --> 02:56.831
Food?

02:56.831 --> 02:58.831
Yes, Daddy,
it's time to eat.

02:58.831 --> 03:01.211
- Get down here.

03:03.001 --> 03:14.751
Fooooood!!

03:15.961 --> 03:17.621
Well, dig in.

03:24.331 --> 03:26.331
Hey, Pony Head,

03:26.331 --> 03:28.001
is it okay if
I skip the trough,

03:28.001 --> 03:32.001
and eat this cupcake
that's on a plate here?

03:32.001 --> 03:34.961
That's Teta's plate.
She ran off.

03:34.961 --> 03:36.961
We always make
a plate for her,

03:36.961 --> 03:38.871
in the hopes that
she'll come back one day.

03:38.871 --> 03:41.211
I hope she's not prettier
than me, though.

03:41.211 --> 03:44.961
She probably ran off
because she can't stand
your sorry butts, okay?

03:44.961 --> 03:48.251
She ran off because
you're always throwing
her shade, Pony Head.

03:48.251 --> 03:50.581
She's always throwing
me shade

03:50.581 --> 03:52.871
by doing her homework
and then being, like,

03:52.871 --> 03:54.831
"I'm gonna donate
to charity."

03:54.831 --> 03:56.411
You know what I mean?
Like, that's very rude.

03:58.871 --> 03:59.961
Shonda and Shinda.

04:01.671 --> 04:03.121
What are you doing?

04:03.121 --> 04:05.211
We wanted to play

04:05.211 --> 04:08.041
some of our original
music for Star.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.081
Nobody wants to hear
your creepy singing

04:10.081 --> 04:11.831
except for dead people.

04:11.831 --> 04:15.041
Are we at
a haunted house?
See what I mean?

04:15.041 --> 04:16.041
I don't know,
I think it's kinda sweet.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.541
I miss Teta!

04:17.541 --> 04:19.671
How do you even know
who Teta is?

04:19.671 --> 04:21.541
You were a zygote
when she disappeared.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.541
- Not cool.
- Really mean.

04:24.911 --> 04:27.041
Now, now, girls,
settle down.

04:28.911 --> 04:31.081
I'm sorry you all
can't handle

04:31.081 --> 04:33.291
how on point
I am right now.

04:33.291 --> 04:35.751
Can't trust anyone
in this house.

04:35.751 --> 04:38.751
Not even
my best friend.

04:38.751 --> 04:40.501
I'm just gonna
go check on her.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.331
Knock, knock.
Can I come in?

04:46.171 --> 04:48.121
So...

04:48.121 --> 04:50.541
I'm really sorry
you felt ganged-up
on down there,

04:50.541 --> 04:52.751
but you gotta admit,
you were being

04:52.751 --> 04:54.831
a little intense,
right?

05:00.711 --> 05:01.791
Hey, Pony Head.

05:01.791 --> 05:04.121
Guess what's in
the casserole...

05:04.121 --> 05:05.501
that I made.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.581
Just take a wild guess.

05:14.411 --> 05:16.831
All right,
I'll just tell you.

05:16.831 --> 05:19.711
It is gingerbread
and ice cream.

05:19.711 --> 05:21.751
Why don't you go eat it
with my sisters

05:21.751 --> 05:23.961
since you think
they're so great?

05:23.961 --> 05:26.211
- Oh, fine.

05:28.711 --> 05:31.081
This casserole
is delicious, Star.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.121
Yeah, I know.

05:33.121 --> 05:35.081
Was Pony Head
mean to you, too?

05:35.081 --> 05:36.791
I don't get it.

05:36.791 --> 05:39.171
It's seems like she just
flipped out of nowhere.

05:39.171 --> 05:42.041
Don't beat
yourself up about it.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.081
She's like that
all the time.

05:44.081 --> 05:46.211
You haven't picked up
on that yet?

05:46.211 --> 05:50.041
I guess she can sometimes
be a little bit--

05:50.041 --> 05:51.751
Of a party pooper.
We know.

05:51.751 --> 05:55.211
She's pooped on
our parties more times
than I can even count.

05:55.211 --> 05:58.171
And then, she
makes fun of me

05:58.171 --> 06:00.791
'cause I don't know
all of my numbers yet.

06:02.371 --> 06:04.001
You poor thing.

06:04.001 --> 06:07.251
Guess who's developed
a complex?

06:07.251 --> 06:09.041
- Uh...
- All of us.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.581
We all did.

06:10.581 --> 06:12.171
She messed us up
real good.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.581
It's true.

06:13.581 --> 06:15.331
Because of
Pony Head's attitude,

06:15.331 --> 06:17.791
I became terribly insecure,

06:17.791 --> 06:20.041
and now, I have
to compensate by putting

06:20.041 --> 06:24.171
all of my self-worth
into my jaw-dropping beauty.

06:24.171 --> 06:27.171
It's real hard, you guys,

06:27.171 --> 06:29.541
and I do it every day.
Every day.

06:29.541 --> 06:32.541
I've never known Pony Head
to be so horrible.

06:32.541 --> 06:34.751
At least
we have each other.

06:34.751 --> 06:38.251
Yeah, we don't need
no stinkin' Pony Head
to have a good time.

06:38.251 --> 06:42.121
We can show you how
a real pony head parties.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.251
Now you look fierce.

06:46.251 --> 06:47.911
Thanks, Pranciss.

06:47.911 --> 06:50.621
Yo, Star,
check this out.

06:50.621 --> 06:53.291
Oh, cool.
Fun trick.

06:53.291 --> 06:55.251
Huh? What do
you think?

06:55.251 --> 06:56.831
I wasn't done.

06:59.621 --> 07:02.251
I'm not sure
what just happened there.

07:02.251 --> 07:03.911
You should be honored.

07:03.911 --> 07:07.251
She only does that
for her sisters.

07:07.251 --> 07:09.541
You're totally like
one of the family now.

07:09.541 --> 07:12.211
Absolutely.

07:12.211 --> 07:15.711
Oh, yay! I've always
wanted sisters.

07:15.711 --> 07:18.291
You know what's the most
awesomest thing about
having sisters?

07:18.291 --> 07:20.251
Arguing over the remote?

07:20.251 --> 07:23.961
That's a good guess,
but it's actually a secret.

07:23.961 --> 07:26.121
Do you like secrets?

07:26.121 --> 07:27.621
Usually.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.961
Do you like
projects?

07:29.961 --> 07:32.751
Yes.

07:32.751 --> 07:36.081
Cool, 'cause we've got
this super secret project

07:36.081 --> 07:39.041
we've been working on,
and we'd love to get
your thoughts on it.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.411
Sweet!

07:44.291 --> 07:46.251
Check it out.

07:46.251 --> 07:49.251
Wait.
Teta on ice?

07:49.251 --> 07:50.961
I thought Teta ran off.

07:50.961 --> 07:52.711
Oh, baby, we're
hatching a plot

07:52.711 --> 07:55.291
to depose Pony Head
as heir to the throne.

07:56.871 --> 08:00.001
No.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.911
Yeah.
.

08:02.911 --> 08:05.411
You saw how she is.

08:05.411 --> 08:07.121
She's unfit to lead.

08:07.121 --> 08:09.331
Yeah, look, we've
got it all figured out.

08:09.331 --> 08:11.211
Pony Law states that

08:11.211 --> 08:15.751
if a pony princess
puts one of her sisters on ice,

08:15.751 --> 08:17.331
she can never be queen.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.251
So we're putting
Teta on ice,

08:19.251 --> 08:21.541
and framing
Pony Head for it.

08:21.541 --> 08:23.911
On ice?

08:23.911 --> 08:25.121
Well, that sounds fun.

08:25.121 --> 08:28.331
No, no, no, no, no, honey.
We mean...

08:28.331 --> 08:31.461
On ice.

08:31.461 --> 08:34.541
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:34.541 --> 08:37.751
Hey, you guys, ice
is supposed to be cool,

08:37.751 --> 08:40.541
and what you're talking
about is bad ice.

08:40.541 --> 08:42.711
Not really.

08:42.711 --> 08:45.171
We're just gonna
pretend Teta's on ice.

08:45.171 --> 08:47.081
Ain't that right, Teta?

08:47.081 --> 08:50.251
Yep. They got a new life
set up for me and everything.

08:50.251 --> 08:52.041
I have a mustache!

08:52.041 --> 08:53.371
What you think, Star?

08:55.001 --> 08:58.371
I got...
a lot of questions.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.331
I know Pony Head
has got some issues,

09:01.331 --> 09:04.621
but don't you think
maybe framing her is a bit much?

09:04.621 --> 09:06.411
Everyone knows

09:06.411 --> 09:08.671
Pony would be
the worst queen ever.

09:08.671 --> 09:10.831
She just won't
admit it to herself.

09:10.831 --> 09:15.541
This way, the right pony
gets to inherit the throne.

09:15.541 --> 09:18.171
Me!!

09:18.171 --> 09:19.871
Wait a minute.

09:19.871 --> 09:22.251
Who said you were
gonna be queen?

09:22.251 --> 09:24.541
I thought I was
gonna be queen.

09:24.541 --> 09:26.751
Pamanda, really?

09:26.751 --> 09:27.961
No, you're right.

09:27.961 --> 09:29.621
I should be queen.

09:29.621 --> 09:32.001
No, I should be queen.
I'm perfect.

09:32.001 --> 09:33.831
No, I should
be queen.

09:33.831 --> 09:35.831
I think I'd
do a good job.

09:35.831 --> 09:38.751
That makes no sense.
You're supposed to be dead.

09:38.751 --> 09:41.001
We talked about this...

09:41.001 --> 09:43.081
Where are you off to
in such a hurry?

09:43.081 --> 09:45.371
- You weren't planning on

09:45.371 --> 09:47.211
telling Pony Head,
now, were you?

09:47.211 --> 09:48.791
No!

09:48.791 --> 09:51.291
Of course not.
Never. No.

09:51.291 --> 09:55.751
'Cause, uh, we can't allow
you to snitch, sugar booger.

09:55.751 --> 09:59.041
You're one of us now...
sister.

10:00.371 --> 10:02.501
And if you betray
your sisters,

10:02.501 --> 10:04.331
you're gonna get
disappeared, too,

10:04.331 --> 10:07.171
- just like Teta.

10:07.171 --> 10:10.171
Bam, you are busted.

10:10.171 --> 10:12.371
Pony, what is going on?

10:12.371 --> 10:14.251
Star, you beautiful angel,
I'm so sorry

10:14.251 --> 10:16.461
you've been put through
this trauma.

10:16.461 --> 10:18.001
I knew these no class-having
wannabe queens

10:18.001 --> 10:20.371
were up to somethin';
I just didn't know what.

10:20.371 --> 10:23.371
And I have it all on video.

10:23.371 --> 10:27.871
This way, the right pony
gets to inherit the throne.

10:27.871 --> 10:30.171
Okay, thanks for having me.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.581
Because I definitely feel
like I've been had.

10:33.581 --> 10:36.251
Oh, unbelievable.

10:36.251 --> 10:38.411
Yeah, so anyway,
thank you, Star,
for coming over.

10:38.411 --> 10:40.411
I know you probably
feel used,

10:40.411 --> 10:42.411
but I couldn't
have done it without you.
Thank you so much.

10:42.411 --> 10:44.211
What, are you kidding?

10:44.211 --> 10:46.671
Pony Head, this is one of
the most stressful experiences

10:46.671 --> 10:48.501
of my already
very intense life.

10:48.501 --> 10:50.291
I'm sorry.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.501
My sisters
are totally insane.

10:52.501 --> 10:54.501
- Oh, totally insane.
- Whoa, hold on.

10:54.501 --> 10:57.331
You cannot just be
sitting up here talking
about my sisters like that.

10:57.331 --> 10:58.831
You just said it yourself.

10:58.831 --> 11:00.711
Star, I love my sisters.

11:00.711 --> 11:03.121
We do this every meal.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.211
I guess I just don't
get the whole sister thing.

11:05.211 --> 11:08.121
You have one of the best
