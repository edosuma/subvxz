00:00.969 --> 00:01.968
Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:01.971 --> 00:02.969
I got your blood results back.

00:02.972 --> 00:04.471
Uh-huh.

00:04.474 --> 00:06.374
The anti-DNA test
came back positive for lupus.

00:06.376 --> 00:08.976
In your profession,
"positive" is a negative thing.

00:08.978 --> 00:10.478
Jack, we can fight this together.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.914
Okay, well, fight it together later?

00:12.916 --> 00:14.449
I've got a lesson.

00:14.451 --> 00:16.250
His lupus is more advanced
than we thought.

00:16.251 --> 00:17.852
It's attacking his kidneys.

00:17.854 --> 00:19.687
I will have another check
with your parents very soon.

00:19.689 --> 00:22.623
I would never have had the
courage to end our arrangement.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.892
You gave me the chance to move on.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.395
You said you wanted to be my friend.

00:27.397 --> 00:28.663
Be my friend.

00:28.665 --> 00:30.465
You know how to be a friend,
don't you doc?

00:30.467 --> 00:31.466
Dialysis?

00:31.468 --> 00:32.567
I assumed you knew.

00:32.569 --> 00:33.568
- Let's go fishing.
- Yes.

00:36.139 --> 00:37.939
He never came in for the procedure.

00:37.941 --> 00:39.073
Maybe I can find him.

00:39.075 --> 00:40.108
You're going to drag him in here,

00:40.110 --> 00:41.909
- kicking and screaming?
- If I have to.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.587 --> 00:53.054
No luck.

00:53.056 --> 00:55.656
Jack's not at any of the fishing
spots Jim knew about.

00:55.658 --> 00:57.525
All my calls are still
going to voice email.

00:57.527 --> 00:58.760
He must have gone further out.

00:58.762 --> 01:00.628
He's not answering his radio.

01:00.630 --> 01:01.896
If he's out there alone and gets weak,

01:01.898 --> 01:03.397
he may not be able to get himself back.

01:03.399 --> 01:04.998
Let's hope he's smart enough
to take care of himself.

01:05.001 --> 01:06.501
Yeah, well...

01:06.503 --> 01:09.003
I'll let everyone know
to keep their eyes peeled.

01:09.005 --> 01:10.505
You okay?

01:10.507 --> 01:11.939
Oh, yeah. Fine.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.975
Yeah? Gonna blame that
on the sun in your eyes too?

01:13.977 --> 01:15.076
What?

01:15.078 --> 01:16.577
You've been wincing all morning.

01:16.579 --> 01:18.045
Every time I ask you about it,
you blame it on the sun.

01:18.047 --> 01:19.413
So I have a headache. Big deal.

01:19.415 --> 01:22.917
Let me see this.

01:22.919 --> 01:26.420
Hey. Hey.

01:26.422 --> 01:27.922
This isn't because of my hep C, is it?

01:27.924 --> 01:30.658
I haven't had any problems since
I finished the interferon.

01:30.660 --> 01:34.428
It's a simple and common inflammation.

01:34.430 --> 01:36.964
Inflamed supraorbital nerve?

01:36.966 --> 01:38.699
Yup.

01:40.136 --> 01:43.905
Here we go.

01:43.907 --> 01:45.339
I've never seen such an advanced form

01:45.341 --> 01:46.340
of treatment before.

01:48.044 --> 01:50.745
Wow.

01:50.747 --> 01:52.446
That's better.

01:52.448 --> 01:53.514
I'm cured.

01:53.516 --> 01:54.782
Yeah, it's not that easy.

01:54.784 --> 01:56.551
The ice is temporary relief.

01:56.553 --> 01:59.086
I'll give you a local anesthetic
and an injection of solu-medrol

01:59.088 --> 02:00.888
to resolve the inflammation completely.

02:00.890 --> 02:01.923
Usual payment okay, doc?

02:01.925 --> 02:02.924
Usual's perfect.

02:04.394 --> 02:07.562
I have never seen a doctor
paid so promptly.

02:07.564 --> 02:08.963
And no paperwork.

02:10.166 --> 02:11.599
You ever get paid in pedicures?

02:11.601 --> 02:13.334
If you could see my toes,
you'd know the answer to that.

02:17.005 --> 02:18.806
We'll find him.

02:18.808 --> 02:19.907
Yeah, I know.

02:19.909 --> 02:22.476
I'm sure he's fine, medically.

02:22.478 --> 02:25.746
He just has a tendency
to take bad news badly.

02:25.748 --> 02:28.216
I'm worried this fast
progression hit him hard.

02:28.218 --> 02:30.918
You guys have become really good friends.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.387
Yeah. I guess we have.

02:33.389 --> 02:34.555
Can you think of any other friends

02:34.557 --> 02:37.625
who might know where he is?

02:37.627 --> 02:39.594
I can think of one.

02:43.632 --> 02:45.666
Jack!

02:45.668 --> 02:48.069
Jack, I got a year's worth
of Sushi on the line!

02:48.071 --> 02:49.337
A little help!

02:49.339 --> 02:51.105
Hang on, hang on.

02:51.107 --> 02:53.207
Dashing knight in shining armor
coming through.

02:53.209 --> 02:55.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

02:57.313 --> 02:59.847
Come on, buddy, just give it up.

03:04.654 --> 03:07.788
Oh, my gosh.

03:07.790 --> 03:08.990
Oh.

03:11.895 --> 03:13.494
No.

03:13.496 --> 03:14.528
Well.

03:14.530 --> 03:16.764
Man.

03:16.766 --> 03:18.499
These fish hate us.

03:18.501 --> 03:20.301
Something we said?

03:20.303 --> 03:23.938
Whew.

03:31.413 --> 03:33.247
Everything okay with Jim?

03:33.249 --> 03:34.548
He's fine. Grouchy as ever.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.986
You guys find Jack?

03:38.988 --> 03:40.922
I called Jill to see if she
heard anything, got her office,

03:40.924 --> 03:42.790
and it turns out she went fishing.

03:42.792 --> 03:45.526
With Jack?

03:45.528 --> 03:46.527
Really?

03:46.529 --> 03:47.862
Really.

03:47.864 --> 03:48.863
Like, <i>fishing</i> fishing?

03:48.865 --> 03:50.831
As opposed to what?

03:50.833 --> 03:52.233
Absolutely nothing.

03:52.235 --> 03:53.334
I'm sure that's exactly
what they're doing.

03:53.336 --> 03:54.969
Are you okay with that?

03:54.971 --> 03:57.271
Honestly, I'm just glad
he's not out there alone.

03:57.273 --> 04:01.742
And she'll make sure he gets
back for dialysis prep.

04:01.744 --> 04:03.244
You got the gift, right?

04:03.246 --> 04:04.445
The christening's in a few hours,

04:04.447 --> 04:05.212
and you remind me of this now?

04:05.214 --> 04:09.717
You didn't get it?

04:09.719 --> 04:11.085
You got it.

04:11.087 --> 04:12.520
It's a good thing I was in
charge of it too.

04:12.522 --> 04:13.254
You, you would have been
scrambling around...

04:13.256 --> 04:14.322
Monogram's wrong.

04:14.324 --> 04:15.690
No, it's not. What?

04:15.692 --> 04:17.257
You're missing a "V" for Von.

04:17.260 --> 04:20.728
Carlos Casseras Kuester Von
Jurgens Ratenicz.

04:20.730 --> 04:22.697
Yeah, it's C.C.K.J.R.
You don't put the "V".

04:22.699 --> 04:24.598
- Yeah, you do.
- It's not a full last name.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.067
It's part of a name.

04:26.069 --> 04:27.201
Then it should be part of the monogram.

04:27.203 --> 04:28.669
It's not a...

04:28.671 --> 04:30.137
look, the monogram's the least
of this kid's problems.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.273
His name sounds like
a game of drunken scrabble.

04:32.275 --> 04:33.274
Can you fix it?

04:33.276 --> 04:34.675
I gotta meet Boris.

04:34.677 --> 04:35.943
Oh, sure, yeah. I'll... I'll fix it.

04:35.945 --> 04:38.145
I'll just go grab a needlepoint
kit from my hope chest.

04:38.147 --> 04:42.083
That would be a lot funnier
if you didn't have a hope chest.

04:47.056 --> 04:52.293
Okay, here we go.

04:52.295 --> 04:55.363
I'm back for less than a day,
and already you have me

04:55.365 --> 04:59.934
in your Frankenstein's laboratory.

04:59.936 --> 05:00.968
Okay.

05:00.970 --> 05:01.936
Clench.

05:01.938 --> 05:02.937
Unclench.

05:02.939 --> 05:03.938
Clench.

05:03.940 --> 05:05.906
Unclench.

05:05.908 --> 05:07.908
I know it seems excessive,
but thallium poisoning

05:07.910 --> 05:09.610
can cause muscle contractures.

05:09.612 --> 05:12.646
The... the metal builds up
in soft tissue and weakens it.

05:12.648 --> 05:15.082
I thought your range of motion
tests were inconclusive,

05:15.084 --> 05:17.918
so this electromyogram will tell
me if your muscles are healthy.

05:19.322 --> 05:20.654
Oh, that does not sound good.

05:21.657 --> 05:23.157
It is.

05:23.159 --> 05:24.992
I want an E.M.G. tech to analyze
the results to be sure,

05:24.994 --> 05:28.095
but you seem to be free
and clear of any symptoms...

05:28.097 --> 05:30.898
genetic or otherwise.

05:32.001 --> 05:33.667
I've been investigating your theory

05:33.669 --> 05:38.039
that our history of illness
may have been the result

05:38.041 --> 05:40.107
of, shall we say, family politics?

05:40.109 --> 05:42.343
You do have a genetic mutation.

05:42.345 --> 05:44.578
Whether that means you'll
eventually become symptomatic

05:44.580 --> 05:48.449
is... a question.

05:48.451 --> 05:52.520
Suddenly my future is unwritten.

05:52.522 --> 05:58.492
Thank you, Hank.

05:58.494 --> 06:00.361
Any news on the investigation?

06:00.363 --> 06:02.663
Our friend, Dieter, is still at large.

06:02.665 --> 06:06.600
He had been in my employ,
in my home for nearly 20 years.

06:06.602 --> 06:09.236
I trusted him with everything.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.873
You'll be attending
the christening today?

06:12.875 --> 06:14.442
Yeah, of course. I can't wait.

06:14.444 --> 06:16.243
Thank you for inviting us.

06:16.245 --> 06:19.613
I must admit, Marisa and I
have an ulterior motive.

06:19.615 --> 06:21.082
Oh, really?

06:21.084 --> 06:22.383
We have discussed the matter,

06:22.385 --> 06:26.353
and we'd like to ask
a great favor of you.

06:26.355 --> 06:30.458
Would you be our son's godfather?

06:30.460 --> 06:32.326
It would be my honor.

06:32.328 --> 06:34.895
Good.

06:38.834 --> 06:41.335
Man.

06:41.337 --> 06:43.471
That fish gave me a workout.

06:43.473 --> 06:46.040
It's good, I can skip the gym this week.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.675
Yeah, Jack.

06:47.677 --> 06:49.376
How are you feeling?

06:49.378 --> 06:51.378
Well, you know those drug commercials

06:51.380 --> 06:53.013
where a reassuring voice comes
on at the end

06:53.015 --> 06:54.615
and talks about possible side effects?

06:54.617 --> 06:57.451
Well, it turns out these side
effects are very possible.

06:57.453 --> 06:58.919
In fact, they're probable even,

06:58.921 --> 07:01.422
because I feel like I've got
every last one of them.

07:01.424 --> 07:02.690
Did you talk to Dr. Greene?

07:02.692 --> 07:03.891
Maybe she can give you something.

07:03.893 --> 07:05.059
Yeah, yeah.

07:05.061 --> 07:07.161
Something with more side effects.

07:08.164 --> 07:09.163
I'll talk to her.

07:09.165 --> 07:10.431
When we go back in.

07:10.433 --> 07:12.733
But we're not going back in empty-handed.

07:12.735 --> 07:15.803
I don't know, the fish are too
smart or they're too full.

07:15.805 --> 07:17.171
Maybe we should call it?

07:17.173 --> 07:19.874
Aw, not you too. Casey, come on.

07:19.876 --> 07:21.308
Look, the only reason I came all
the way out here

07:21.310 --> 07:23.644
was to get away from people
feeling sorry for me.

07:23.646 --> 07:25.813
I feel sorry for me.
I could use a shower.

07:26.849 --> 07:28.082
Yeah?

07:28.084 --> 07:30.184
Maybe that's why the fish hate us.

07:30.186 --> 07:32.486
Okay, so... home?

07:32.488 --> 07:36.223
Not yet, "Jilligan." I'm feeling lucky.

08:19.374 --> 08:23.777
Hi.

08:23.779 --> 08:27.213
I'm sorry. It's a little less
than previous payments.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.216
My parents won't like this.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.818
Please tell them that it is temporary.

08:31.820 --> 08:34.421
I've hit a bit of a financial speed bump.

08:34.423 --> 08:36.789
I tried again to talk them out of it.

08:36.792 --> 08:38.158
I understand it's not your fault.

08:39.294 --> 08:41.227
I've got to get to work.

08:41.229 --> 08:45.398
Don't move.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.600
Oh, my God. Is it a bee?

08:47.602 --> 08:49.402
No. Of course not.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.770
You know I'm petrified of bees.

08:50.772 --> 08:52.872
I know, your father's deathly allergic.

08:52.874 --> 08:53.940
But it's not a bee.

08:53.942 --> 08:56.943
Hold still for a moment.

09:10.391 --> 09:13.126
There.

09:13.128 --> 09:14.127
It was a bee.

09:14.129 --> 09:17.130
Yes.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.980
Hey, why are you here?

09:33.982 --> 09:36.483
This is a clinic patient,
not a potential retainer.

09:36.485 --> 09:38.651
I know. I'm here to see you.

09:38.653 --> 09:40.186
I am.

09:40.188 --> 09:43.022
We never just hang out
and talk anymore, Divya.

09:43.024 --> 09:44.591
Well, you talk plenty.

09:44.593 --> 09:47.427
Besides, shouldn't you be
spending time with Paige

09:47.429 --> 09:48.695
before she leaves
for the rest of the summer?

09:48.697 --> 09:50.163
No, she's with her family today.

09:50.165 --> 09:51.965
You have me all to yourself.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.366
So...

09:53.368 --> 09:56.069
um, anything you want to share?

09:56.071 --> 09:57.770
Not that I can think of.

09:57.772 --> 09:59.172
Really? How about your love life?

09:59.174 --> 10:00.273
How's that going?

10:00.275 --> 10:02.108
Hmm.

10:02.110 --> 10:04.878
All right, I saw you and Raj earlier.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.546
Are you guys back together?

10:06.548 --> 10:08.047
Is it because of your family?

10:08.049 --> 10:09.349
Or is it Raj?

10:09.351 --> 10:10.683
Is he pressuring you?

10:10.685 --> 10:11.818
That is nothing for you to worry about.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.186
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

10:13.188 --> 10:14.487
- Hi.
- How's Boris?

10:14.489 --> 10:15.655
Great.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.056
And he asked me to be godfather.

10:17.058 --> 10:18.691
Evan, so help me,
if you do a Brando impression,

10:18.693 --> 10:19.926
we're dissolving the business.

10:19.928 --> 10:21.261
I wasn't going to do that.

10:21.263 --> 10:22.262
Yeah.

10:22.264 --> 10:23.796
Uh, you said no, right?

10:23.798 --> 10:25.231
Why would I say no?

10:25.233 --> 10:26.666
Yeah, it's the sweetest thing
that I've ever heard.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.268
What? Guys!

10:28.270 --> 10:30.003
This is Boris.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.504
He's got a crazy family.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.839
He's got a crazy, murderous family.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.207
Henry, if you become godfather,

10:34.209 --> 10:36.509
you instantly become an honorary
member of that family.

10:36.511 --> 10:40.446
Hank, Divya!

10:40.448 --> 10:42.115
- Hey, Luke.
- Hello.

10:42.117 --> 10:43.416
Good to see you, Bud.

10:43.418 --> 10:44.584
Jill's nephew.

10:44.586 --> 10:45.785
Oh, wow.

10:45.787 --> 10:47.020
Hey, Luke. Evan R. Lawson.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.221
- CFO, right.
- Yeah.

10:48.223 --> 10:49.622
We don't need a CFO. Just doctors.

10:49.624 --> 10:50.990
It's my boss.
I'm really worried about her.

10:50.992 --> 10:52.192
What is it?

10:52.194 --> 10:53.293
You should see for yourself.

10:53.295 --> 10:54.627
Come on. I'll take you to her.

10:54.629 --> 10:55.762
Quincy's her name. She's super rad.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.698
That's surf lingo I've been
trying to learn.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.434
Wait till you meet her.

11:01.436 --> 11:04.137
Oh, that's her.

11:04.139 --> 11:05.705
Quincy! Quincy!

11:05.707 --> 11:08.374
Okay, you can't hear me.

11:11.745 --> 11:13.479
Hey, Luke. What is that?

11:13.481 --> 11:14.614
This? It's only vitamins.

11:14.616 --> 11:15.715
No caffeine.

11:15.717 --> 11:16.749
It's just how I am all the time.

11:16.751 --> 11:17.984
Where was I?

11:17.986 --> 11:19.886
- Quincy.
- Oh.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.788
Did I tell you she got a spot
on the junior surf team

11:21.790 --> 11:23.623
when she was only 13?

11:23.625 --> 11:25.124
Oh. Wow.

11:25.126 --> 11:26.459
- Yeah.
- That's her.

11:26.461 --> 11:27.927
Hey.

11:27.929 --> 11:29.395
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.496
That doesn't look so tough.

11:30.498 --> 11:31.965
How come I always see people falling?

11:31.967 --> 11:33.566
It's not tough at all
with a few short lessons.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.034
Can I interest you?

11:35.036 --> 11:36.269
Uh, no, they're from
my aunt Jill's clinic.

11:36.271 --> 11:37.804
Yeah, we're here to help you.

11:37.806 --> 11:39.205
With what?

11:39.207 --> 11:41.841
Look at that sunburn.
It can give her skin cancer.

11:41.843 --> 11:42.809
Yeah, we can take a look at that.

11:42.811 --> 11:44.077
Any other symptoms?

11:44.079 --> 11:45.612
She's also been feeling sick.

11:45.614 --> 11:47.714
Luke, why don't you give us
a few moments of privacy?

11:47.716 --> 11:50.350
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure.
- Bye.

11:50.352 --> 11:52.085
Uh, Quincy,

11:52.087 --> 11:53.219
is it just on your face and legs?

11:53.221 --> 11:55.255
Uh, some on my shoulders.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.724
It itches a little, but it won't kill me.

11:57.726 --> 11:58.791
Okay.

11:58.793 --> 11:59.826
Luke mentioned you were feeling sick.

11:59.828 --> 12:01.494
A teeny bit of nausea.

12:01.496 --> 12:04.197
Have you eaten anything unusual today?

12:04.199 --> 12:05.231
Could you be pregnant?

12:05.233 --> 12:06.666
No, no, no.

12:06.668 --> 12:08.935
Her boyfriend's been
gone on the world surf tour.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.003
He's only ranked ninth.

12:10.005 --> 12:11.838
Stop eavesdropping, Luke.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.706
Go welcome the next group
of paddleboarders

12:13.708 --> 12:14.907
for their lesson.

12:14.909 --> 12:17.343
On it, Quincy. Don't worry.

12:17.345 --> 12:20.346
He's a smart, obviously energetic kid,

12:20.348 --> 12:22.215
so I gave him a summer job.

12:22.217 --> 12:23.416
He means well.

12:23.418 --> 12:25.685
I just try to keep him away from anything

12:25.687 --> 12:27.487
he can break, tear, or destroy.

12:28.923 --> 12:30.023
Wow, you want I should
go keep an eye on him?

12:30.025 --> 12:32.258
Yeah.

12:32.260 --> 12:34.927
Don't you break, tear,
or destroy anything either.

12:34.929 --> 12:37.897
So, back to the pregnancy question...

12:37.899 --> 12:39.632
Yeah, Luke... Luke's right.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.501
My boyfriend's been away
for a few months.

12:41.503 --> 12:44.537
Um, we take turns competing.

12:44.539 --> 12:47.006
So with him gone, I've just
been working triple time.

12:47.008 --> 12:48.908
You know, it's probably
why I'm not feeling well.

12:48.910 --> 12:51.277
Or your nausea could be caused
by the dehydration

12:51.279 --> 12:52.412
due to the burn.

12:52.414 --> 12:53.946
Yeah, you got to wear
sunscreen every day.

12:53.948 --> 12:55.381
Especially since you're outside so much.

12:55.383 --> 12:57.016
Oh, yeah, I do. I... I know the drill.

12:57.018 --> 12:58.451
How old is your sunscreen?

12:58.453 --> 13:00.420
It loses effectiveness over time.

13:00.422 --> 13:01.621
You think it maybe went bad?

13:01.623 --> 13:02.955
Possibly.

13:02.957 --> 13:03.990
We can give you something for the nausea,

13:03.992 --> 13:05.124
but I think Divya is right.

13:05.126 --> 13:06.993
What you really need is to hydrate.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.062
I will. I promise.

13:09.064 --> 13:11.397
Guess it's a good thing Luke
called you guys after all.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.999
We won't tell him.

13:23.110 --> 13:25.545
Okay, Jack. It's time to go.

13:25.547 --> 13:28.448
No, I told you. I'm... I'm feeling lucky.

13:28.450 --> 13:30.016
Yeah, well, you don't look lucky.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.051
Casey...

13:32.053 --> 13:34.687
please stop treating me
like a sick person.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.955
Problem is...

13:35.957 --> 13:40.026
you kind of look like a sick person.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.160
Well, that's just mean.

13:41.162 --> 13:43.396
Sorry.

13:43.398 --> 13:47.767
So you can drive this thing
back to land, or I can.

13:47.769 --> 13:49.736
What's it going to be?

13:49.738 --> 13:51.771
You got a license?

13:51.773 --> 13:52.839
I don't need one.

13:52.841 --> 13:53.873
Which way's the stern?

13:53.875 --> 13:54.974
Right there.

13:54.976 --> 13:58.277
- You're hired.
- Thank you.

13:58.279 --> 14:01.280
Take a little break.

14:27.942 --> 14:29.475
Um...

14:29.477 --> 14:32.011
no one's here.

14:32.013 --> 14:34.781
Need I point out that we are
in fact here?

14:34.783 --> 14:36.816
Seriously, where is everybody else?

14:36.818 --> 14:39.786
Hankmed can't be the only people
Boris and Marisa know.

14:39.788 --> 14:42.622
Marisa's family's in Cuba,
Boris' family...

14:42.624 --> 14:44.524
Greedy murderers.

14:44.526 --> 14:45.992
If you were him,
you'd err on the safe side too.

14:45.994 --> 14:48.394
Wow.

14:48.396 --> 14:49.762
Ah.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.832
<i>Padrino,</i> please, we are ready.

14:52.834 --> 14:56.569
Godfather coming through.

14:56.571 --> 15:00.006
Sorry.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.246
Thank you both for being here
on this joyous day.

15:07.248 --> 15:12.652
I'm sorry for interrupting.

15:16.491 --> 15:20.259
It's safe to assume this side is family.

15:29.404 --> 15:32.071
I did not invite you here.

15:32.073 --> 15:33.105
I wanted to...

15:33.107 --> 15:36.576
Undoubtedly, you want something,

15:36.578 --> 15:40.012
but you won't find it here.

15:43.016 --> 15:46.319
Let's continue, shall we?

15:56.816 --> 15:58.350
Hello, everyone.

15:58.352 --> 16:00.152
Such a small group,
it will be easy to mingle.

16:00.154 --> 16:03.489
Uh, it seemed like Boris
didn't really want you here.

16:03.491 --> 16:06.525
We have a complicated family.

16:06.527 --> 16:09.194
Claudette Von Jurgens, his cousin.

16:09.196 --> 16:11.330
Nice to meet you.

16:11.332 --> 16:13.499
A distant cousin, probably, right?

16:13.501 --> 16:16.535
Since you sound French and Boris is...

16:16.537 --> 16:17.536
What is he?

16:17.538 --> 16:20.005
I am French-Swiss.

16:20.007 --> 16:21.740
You must be very close to Boris.

16:21.742 --> 16:23.075
And trusted.

16:23.077 --> 16:24.409
I hope so.

16:24.411 --> 16:27.045
Well, he made you godfather to his son.

16:27.047 --> 16:29.314
That position is usually
reserved for family.

16:29.316 --> 16:32.050
Especially in our family.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.488
Excuse me.

16:36.490 --> 16:39.158
You must be Marisa.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.393
I'm so pleased to finally meet you.

16:41.395 --> 16:43.929
Of course, Claudette.
Boris has mentioned you.

16:43.931 --> 16:46.265
You would spend your vacation
together as children.

16:46.267 --> 16:47.933
Your parents would
send you to Shadow Pond.

16:47.935 --> 16:49.434
That's right.

16:49.436 --> 16:52.738
I'm touched you hold the memory
as close to your heart as I do.

16:52.740 --> 16:55.274
It's obvious I purposefully
kept the family away

16:55.276 --> 16:56.241
from this event, Claudette.

16:56.243 --> 16:57.242
So what are you doing here?

16:57.244 --> 16:58.443
Boris.

16:58.445 --> 17:00.412
It's a perfectly reasonable question.

17:00.414 --> 17:04.483
The Kuesters and the Rateniczes
have always been at odds.

17:04.484 --> 17:07.118
While we, Von Jurgens remain
rather neutral.

17:07.121 --> 17:09.788
Yeah, we don't need
a family history lesson.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.557
The Rateniczes thought that a christening

17:11.559 --> 17:14.026
was the ideal place
to extend an olive branch.

17:14.028 --> 17:15.794
And they asked me to come,

17:15.796 --> 17:18.030
thinking me the least
threatening messenger.

17:18.031 --> 17:20.898
We do not need any messages
from the Rateniczes.

17:20.901 --> 17:23.402
They aren't bad people. All of them.

17:23.404 --> 17:26.171
Some rogue and off-balance family members

17:26.173 --> 17:27.205
may have tried to hurt Boris...

17:27.208 --> 17:29.074
Claudette.

17:29.076 --> 17:30.142
I'm not sure what you want.

17:30.144 --> 17:31.176
I don't know if you're lying

17:31.178 --> 17:32.678
or if you're terribly naive,

17:32.680 --> 17:34.479
but my son's christening
is hardly the time,

17:34.481 --> 17:36.481
wouldn't you say?

17:36.483 --> 17:38.550
Of course. I completely understand.

17:38.552 --> 17:40.552
I'm sure you do.

17:56.703 --> 17:58.370
Hey.

17:58.372 --> 18:01.073
Uh, oh, no, thank you.
I won't be staying long.

18:03.843 --> 18:05.544
Thank you for meeting me.

18:05.546 --> 18:07.379
Of course.

18:07.381 --> 18:12.384
After talking to Divya
about her... situation with you,

18:12.386 --> 18:15.687
I decided that I should probably
get your side of things too.

18:15.689 --> 18:17.256
You're worried about her?

18:17.258 --> 18:18.523
Yeah, I am.

18:18.525 --> 18:20.826
I must admit I am too,

18:20.828 --> 18:24.296
but we have an arrangement
agreeable for now.

18:24.298 --> 18:27.199
She sees me. She gives me what she can.

18:27.201 --> 18:30.435
She gives you... what's that?

18:30.437 --> 18:32.070
A purely financial transaction.

18:32.072 --> 18:34.473
We've tried to keep emotion out of it.

18:34.475 --> 18:37.576
I thought you were a decent guy, Raj.

18:37.578 --> 18:39.278
My parents insist it.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.146
Oh, your parents insist it.

18:41.148 --> 18:43.081
Okay, um,

18:43.083 --> 18:45.784
what kind of screwed-up family
are you in, man?

18:45.786 --> 18:48.720
We are talking about Divya's
debt to my parents

18:48.722 --> 18:51.023
for the wedding?

18:56.563 --> 18:58.030
Uh, yes, exactly.

18:58.032 --> 19:01.300
That's what we're talking about.

19:08.308 --> 19:09.808
Hey.

19:09.810 --> 19:11.043
I got your message.

19:11.045 --> 19:12.077
Your nausea's worse?

19:12.079 --> 19:13.245
Yeah.

19:13.247 --> 19:15.847
I'm dizzy, and my heart's racing

19:15.849 --> 19:17.649
like I just took
a ten wave set to the head.

19:17.651 --> 19:18.950
Well, I think you better sit down.

19:18.952 --> 19:21.219
Can't, I've got a group coming in.

19:21.221 --> 19:23.622
If I cancel on clients, I lose clients.

19:23.624 --> 19:25.991
I understand.

19:25.993 --> 19:28.427
I was working two jobs recently.

19:28.429 --> 19:29.695
I pushed myself so hard

19:29.697 --> 19:32.064
that I couldn't be my best at either.

19:33.734 --> 19:36.268
I'm just so tired.

19:36.270 --> 19:41.840
I'm doing my best, but I feel
I'm always catching up.

19:41.842 --> 19:43.608
Your eyes... they're slightly yellow.

19:43.610 --> 19:44.976
What does that mean?

19:44.978 --> 19:47.112
It's the beginning of jaundice.

19:47.114 --> 19:48.947
It's an indicator of liver infection.

19:48.949 --> 19:50.382
What?

19:50.384 --> 19:52.351
Have you been vaccinated for hepatitis A?

19:52.353 --> 19:55.253
No.

19:55.255 --> 19:58.290
Um, no, I've heard of hep A in the ocean,

19:58.292 --> 20:00.292
but there haven't been any advisories

20:00.294 --> 20:01.626
anywhere even near here.

20:01.628 --> 20:05.430
With hep A in the water,
they would warn people.

20:05.432 --> 20:08.700
A beach closure would completely
destroy my business.

20:08.702 --> 20:10.335
No one is talking about closures.

20:10.337 --> 20:13.538
Divya, I'm a longboarder.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.842
There are barely any sponsors
for women surfers.

20:16.844 --> 20:20.212
So this shop...

20:20.214 --> 20:23.115
right now is all I have.

20:23.117 --> 20:25.217
There's no retirement plan in surfing.

20:25.219 --> 20:27.285
Well, I'm going to make sure
that you're healthy enough,

20:27.287 --> 20:29.855
that you can retire when you choose.

20:29.857 --> 20:32.758
So let's take this one step at a time.

20:32.760 --> 20:36.027
First, a full blood panel.

20:36.029 --> 20:38.463
Okay.

21:02.121 --> 21:03.488
Hey.

21:03.490 --> 21:04.256
I've been trying to reach you guys.

21:04.258 --> 21:05.257
How's Jack?

21:05.259 --> 21:06.425
Not so hot.

21:06.427 --> 21:08.660
I had him rest while we head
back to shore.

21:08.662 --> 21:10.228
How far away are you?

21:10.230 --> 21:12.697
Probably about an hour out
from north shore dock

21:12.699 --> 21:14.099
where we rented the boat.

21:14.101 --> 21:15.600
Wait, listen, Hank.

21:15.602 --> 21:17.536
Jack says that these are the side effects

21:17.538 --> 21:21.873
of his medication, but... I'm worried.

21:21.875 --> 21:24.376
Yeah, so am I.

21:33.304 --> 21:34.670
Nina, hey.

21:34.672 --> 21:35.671
Found Jack.

21:35.673 --> 21:36.772
Jill says he's sweaty,

21:36.774 --> 21:38.407
and he's been asleep all morning.

21:38.409 --> 21:40.976
Before that, he was weak and had
trouble catching his breath.

21:40.978 --> 21:43.279
Well, considering his
creatinine and B.U.N. numbers,

21:43.281 --> 21:45.848
I'd expect him to be fatigued
and fluid over-load.

21:45.850 --> 21:47.950
He's been surprising energetic
up until now.

21:47.952 --> 21:49.018
Yeah, I thought so.

21:49.020 --> 21:50.553
I just wanted to confirm before I go.

21:50.555 --> 21:51.787
Go where?

21:51.789 --> 21:53.189
I'm going to meet the boat at the dock,

21:53.191 --> 21:54.290
then I'm going to drag his ass
over to your office

21:54.292 --> 21:55.491
for dialysis prep.

21:55.493 --> 21:56.826
Great, I just got off work.

21:56.828 --> 21:57.860
I'll go with you.

21:57.862 --> 21:58.861
No, no, no. Don't.

21:58.863 --> 22:00.396
I'm sure he's fine.

22:00.398 --> 22:01.197
I don't want you to waste
the rest of your day

22:01.199 --> 22:02.498
on my nagging feeling.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.200
I'll pick you up in ten.

22:04.202 --> 22:06.135
Make it five.

22:27.791 --> 22:31.060
Wow, it is beautiful out here.

22:31.062 --> 22:33.362
Not a big fisherman... woman, person?

22:33.364 --> 22:35.598
No.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.067
The closest thing I ever got to
fishing was eating fish sticks.

22:40.037 --> 22:42.037
But I do love it out here.

22:42.039 --> 22:45.574
Hank, I have not been outside
of the hospital this much since

22:45.576 --> 22:48.277
I started working in a hospital.

22:48.279 --> 22:49.945
Welcome to concierge medicine.

22:49.947 --> 22:53.249
I gotta say, it's not bad.

22:53.251 --> 22:55.818
Yeah.

22:55.820 --> 22:57.186
Except when you're chasing a patient

22:57.188 --> 23:00.656
who isn't ready to be helped.

23:02.092 --> 23:03.926
You know what? Um...

23:05.196 --> 23:08.297
sell off the JP Morgan
high yield "A" bond, then.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.432
Yeah, and transfer the funds
to my personal checking account.

23:12.436 --> 23:13.969
Great.

23:13.971 --> 23:16.105
When will that be available?

23:16.107 --> 23:18.073
Tomorrow's perfect. That's perfect.

23:18.075 --> 23:20.709
Great, give me a call
if there's any problem.

23:20.711 --> 23:22.711
All right, bye.

23:25.682 --> 23:27.316
Claudette.

23:27.318 --> 23:28.684
You must be lost.

23:28.686 --> 23:31.487
Uh, Boris' house is the gigantic
castle next door.

23:31.489 --> 23:33.722
Is Hank home by any chance?

23:33.724 --> 23:35.357
I have a favor to ask.

23:35.359 --> 23:36.358
No, he's not.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.526
Oh.

23:37.528 --> 23:38.694
Why do you want Hank?

23:38.696 --> 23:39.929
Unless it's a medical question.

23:39.931 --> 23:41.530
It's not.

23:41.532 --> 23:45.034
Maybe you can help?

23:45.036 --> 23:47.036
Sure, come in.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.575
Boris dismissed my terms to negotiate

23:52.577 --> 23:54.777
a detente in our family.

23:54.779 --> 23:57.513
I understand he's upset,
and I understand why.

23:57.515 --> 23:59.148
Oh, you mean because people in his family

23:59.150 --> 24:02.318
ran his car off the road because
they thought Marisa was in it?

24:02.320 --> 24:04.220
Actually, our friend, Jill,
happened to be in it.

24:04.222 --> 24:05.354
Which is beside the point,

24:05.356 --> 24:07.423
because then they tried to poison him.

24:07.425 --> 24:10.159
Yes, and they turned his most
trusted employee against him.

24:10.161 --> 24:11.594
Yeah, Dieter.

24:11.596 --> 24:13.662
I still can't believe it was him.

24:13.664 --> 24:15.431
Was he working for them all along?

24:15.433 --> 24:18.567
Is that whole quiet sidekick
thing just an act?

24:18.569 --> 24:21.670
Were those glasses even real?

24:21.672 --> 24:23.405
You know what? Never mind.

24:23.407 --> 24:25.140
I find it's best to know
as little about Boris

24:25.142 --> 24:26.909
and his personal life as possible.

24:26.911 --> 24:28.978
I want to talk to Boris.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.580
I tried to, but it seems he's too busy.

24:31.582 --> 24:33.983
We used to be very close.

24:33.985 --> 24:36.518
And what's happened is inexcusable

24:36.520 --> 24:38.554
and unacceptable.

24:38.556 --> 24:40.089
But we are family.

24:40.091 --> 24:42.124
And that's the most important thing.

24:42.126 --> 24:44.159
So...

24:44.161 --> 24:45.694
why are you here?

24:45.696 --> 24:50.666
I was hoping Hank will be
willing to give this to Boris.

24:50.668 --> 24:52.034
Boris trusts Hank.

24:52.036 --> 24:53.769
As well he should.

24:53.771 --> 24:55.371
Hank would never betray him.

24:55.373 --> 24:58.807
Nor would I ever ask him to.

24:58.809 --> 25:01.310
We're all on the same side.

25:01.312 --> 25:06.382
Hank, me, you.

25:06.384 --> 25:08.651
If you could ask Hank
to deliver this package

25:08.653 --> 25:11.053
to Boris today, after 5:00 P.M.

25:11.055 --> 25:13.455
5:00 P.M.

25:13.457 --> 25:14.556
Yes.

25:14.558 --> 25:15.824
This isn't suspicious at all.

25:15.826 --> 25:18.027
Tell him it's a gift from me.

25:18.029 --> 25:21.330
It's a gift.

25:21.332 --> 25:23.832
Huh, uh, tell me.

25:23.834 --> 25:25.901
What does one get
the man who has everything?

25:25.903 --> 25:29.505
Proof that I want
to bring the family together,

25:29.507 --> 25:32.942
proof that I'm empowered
to speak on their behalf,

25:32.944 --> 25:36.712
and proof that I can be trusted.

25:47.357 --> 25:49.758
So, uh, I have no idea what's in there,

25:49.760 --> 25:51.026
I have no interest in finding out,

25:51.028 --> 25:52.594
Claudette Von Jurgens gave it to me,

25:52.596 --> 25:53.595
said it was for Boris.

25:53.597 --> 25:54.897
A gift.

25:54.899 --> 25:57.132
Yeah, sounded suspicious to me too.

25:58.935 --> 26:01.170
Your hep A screen came back negative...

26:01.172 --> 26:02.538
Oh, thank God.

26:02.540 --> 26:05.007
But your liver enzymes
are highly elevated.

26:05.009 --> 26:07.109
I didn't even know I had liver enzymes.

26:07.111 --> 26:09.678
Your liver is not functioning correctly.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.381
I want to take you to Hamptons
Heritage for a CT scan,

26:12.383 --> 26:13.415
rule everything out.

26:13.417 --> 26:15.451
- Everything.
- Mm-hmm.

26:15.453 --> 26:17.353
Can we go tonight after I close up?

26:17.355 --> 26:18.454
I'd rather not.

26:18.456 --> 26:19.855
So it's a serious "everything."

26:19.857 --> 26:22.825
We will not be gone for very
long, I promise.

26:27.565 --> 26:30.132
Did, uh, Luke get you those bottles?

26:30.134 --> 26:32.334
No, he gets them from me.

26:32.336 --> 26:33.502
May I?

26:33.504 --> 26:36.038
He eats what I eat,
he drinks what I drink.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.340
The kid looks up to me.
I'm not really sure why.

26:38.342 --> 26:39.875
Why are you taking two bottles?

26:39.877 --> 26:41.543
Well, you don't need this much energy.

26:41.545 --> 26:43.912
Oh, yes, I do.

26:43.914 --> 26:45.247
Quincy,

26:45.249 --> 26:46.315
how many are you taking in a day?

26:46.317 --> 26:50.786
Oh, um, six, eight? Maybe ten.

26:50.788 --> 26:53.856
So in a day, you're averaging
50 hours worth of energy?

26:53.858 --> 26:55.457
I've never thought about it like that.

26:55.459 --> 26:56.792
I think I know what's wrong with you.

26:56.794 --> 26:59.094
Your body may have overdosed on niacin.

26:59.096 --> 27:00.996
Otherwise known as vitamin B3.

27:00.998 --> 27:03.032
It's one of the ingredients
in this drink,

27:03.034 --> 27:05.300
and too much of it can cause a flush

27:05.302 --> 27:08.804
that can look like a sunburn
and compromise liver function.

27:08.806 --> 27:12.274
Wait, so did my diagnosis
just get better or worse?

27:12.276 --> 27:13.609
Better.

27:13.611 --> 27:15.477
If you stop drinking these immediately,

27:15.479 --> 27:17.813
usually your liver heals itself.

27:17.815 --> 27:19.748
That's amazing news.

27:19.750 --> 27:21.683
So then I don't have to close up shop.

27:21.685 --> 27:23.619
Nope. I'm afraid not.

27:23.621 --> 27:26.221
You still need supportive treatment.

27:26.223 --> 27:28.190
You need IV hydration

27:28.192 --> 27:31.026
and monitoring of your
liver function and healing.

27:31.028 --> 27:32.694
It can't wait till tomorrow?

27:32.696 --> 27:34.530
I'm sorry.

27:34.532 --> 27:36.065
Oh, wait.

27:36.067 --> 27:39.334
If I'm overdosing on niacin,
Luke is drinking this too.

27:39.336 --> 27:40.969
- We should go find him.
- Yeah.

27:40.971 --> 27:42.538
Guys, I'm fine.

27:42.540 --> 27:43.906
I sip it, don't really like it very much.

27:43.908 --> 27:47.009
I was closing down the... wet suits,

27:47.011 --> 27:48.677
and couldn't help but overhearing your...

27:48.679 --> 27:51.180
You mean eavesdropping?

27:51.182 --> 27:54.049
Anyway, my aunt Jill is pretty awesome.

27:54.051 --> 27:55.317
Runs the hospital.

27:55.319 --> 27:56.652
I'll make a few calls, pull some strings,

27:56.654 --> 27:58.353
and I know you're worried about the shop,

27:58.355 --> 27:59.822
but I promise you, Quincy,

27:59.824 --> 28:02.257
I'll take really good care of it.

28:02.259 --> 28:04.359
I'll be a great salesman,
a trusted cashier,

28:04.361 --> 28:06.095
and I won't break anything.

28:06.097 --> 28:08.430
I swear.

28:27.617 --> 28:30.619
Hey.

28:38.728 --> 28:41.096
Hey, Jack.

28:41.098 --> 28:44.099
Hey.

28:48.505 --> 28:50.305
Hey, bud.

28:50.307 --> 28:54.610
They say the best way
to a fisherman's heart

28:54.612 --> 28:57.713
is through his fly.

28:57.715 --> 29:00.115
Jack, we need to get you off this boat.

29:00.117 --> 29:02.050
Yeah, Jill didn't care
for that one, either.

29:02.052 --> 29:03.485
I'm fine.

29:03.487 --> 29:04.987
Jack, we need to get you to a hospital.

29:04.989 --> 29:06.522
The nearest level one
is Greenport Medical,

29:06.524 --> 29:07.523
about an hour away.

29:07.525 --> 29:08.924
That's too far.

29:08.926 --> 29:12.427
I'll get them here as fast as I can.

29:12.429 --> 29:14.596
Jack.

29:15.599 --> 29:17.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:17.401 --> 29:19.601
Jack.

29:24.440 --> 29:29.378
He's very tachypneic
and cyanotic looking.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.879
I hear rhonchi.

29:30.881 --> 29:34.016
His heart sounds are muffled.

29:34.018 --> 29:35.284
Is there a pulsus paradoxus?

29:35.286 --> 29:37.886
No, radial pulse. Yeah, probably is.

29:37.888 --> 29:39.721
He has jugular venous distention.

29:39.723 --> 29:41.256
It's all the signs
of a cardiac tamponade.

29:41.258 --> 29:42.791
If we don't get the fluid building up

29:42.793 --> 29:43.692
around his heart drained,
he's going to arrest.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.127
I'll start the IV line.

29:45.129 --> 29:46.361
Ambulance will be here in less than 20.

29:46.363 --> 29:47.396
He doesn't have that much time.

29:47.398 --> 29:48.597
We gotta drain the fluid here.

29:48.599 --> 29:49.698
You're going to do a pericardiocentesis

29:49.700 --> 29:50.866
right here on the dock?

29:50.868 --> 29:53.468
Yeah. We don't have a choice.

30:02.513 --> 30:05.514
Okay, here it is.

30:13.923 --> 30:16.325
Ah, okay.

30:16.327 --> 30:18.894
Oh, Panky...

30:18.896 --> 30:20.829
is the whole stabbing in the chest thing

30:20.831 --> 30:22.364
really necessary?

30:22.366 --> 30:24.299
I thought we were friends.

30:35.751 --> 30:39.754
I'm going with Jack. I'll call you later.

30:40.890 --> 30:42.123
How you doing?

30:42.125 --> 30:46.928
Can't complain.

30:46.930 --> 30:49.063
Hey, doc, let me ask you something.

30:49.065 --> 30:52.867
On a scale of one to two, how bad?

30:52.869 --> 30:55.837
It's better now. Not good yet.

30:55.839 --> 30:57.005
You should have gotten the treatment.

30:57.007 --> 30:58.272
Dr. Greene told you you needed.

30:58.274 --> 31:00.641
Maybe I messed up a little.

31:02.612 --> 31:04.078
Can I ask you something else?

31:04.080 --> 31:05.313
Yeah?

31:05.315 --> 31:06.881
Go to the dock to meet me,

31:06.883 --> 31:09.017
or was I just some excuse

31:09.019 --> 31:13.254
to get some quality dockside
time with Dr. Nina Greene?

31:13.256 --> 31:14.622
Believe it or not, it was to see you,

31:14.624 --> 31:16.991
and for some reason,
Nina insisted on joining me.

31:16.993 --> 31:19.293
I mean, you ruined a perfectly
good day for both of us.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.262
Yeah, I have that effect on people.

31:26.169 --> 31:29.170
Now might be a good time to stand.

31:47.089 --> 31:49.624
You're falling.

31:49.626 --> 31:51.726
Stop.

31:59.202 --> 32:01.169
This is nowhere near as easy
as Quincy made it sound.

32:02.138 --> 32:03.504
Evan, this was your idea.

32:03.506 --> 32:05.807
I know. It's not natural.

32:05.809 --> 32:08.676
Unless you're a gondolier,
it's just showing off.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.411
Who cares? Who cares?

32:10.413 --> 32:12.280
Then why did you insist on Quincy

32:12.282 --> 32:15.183
paying Hankmed back
with paddleboat lessons?

32:15.185 --> 32:16.851
And why didn't you want to wait
for her to get out

32:16.853 --> 32:18.186
of the hospital tomorrow

32:18.188 --> 32:20.455
so that she could teach us herself?

32:20.457 --> 32:24.292
Because I didn't want to cut
into her paying customers' time.

32:24.294 --> 32:26.994
She seemed pretty concerned with
keeping her business afloat.

32:26.996 --> 32:28.629
So to speak.

32:28.631 --> 32:29.931
You know,

32:29.933 --> 32:34.702
financial pressure can be pretty
overwhelming at times.

32:34.704 --> 32:36.170
- Evan.
- What?

32:36.172 --> 32:40.842
Oh, you mean, kind of like
your deal with Raj's parents?

32:42.445 --> 32:44.745
Just what... do not walk away.

32:46.249 --> 32:50.284
Yes, you have conveniently
made that impossible,

32:50.286 --> 32:51.419
haven't you?

32:51.421 --> 32:52.386
Now I understand why we're here.

32:52.388 --> 32:53.488
Okay,

32:53.490 --> 32:54.555
here's what I've been thinking.

32:54.557 --> 32:56.424
Five truly terrifying words.

32:56.426 --> 32:57.825
I've given this a lot of thought.

32:57.827 --> 33:00.294
So as you know, Hankmed
is a family business,

33:00.296 --> 33:02.830
founded by two brothers and a Divya.

33:02.832 --> 33:04.432
Yes, I remember.

33:04.434 --> 33:06.801
In all this time, you have become

33:06.803 --> 33:08.936
not only one of my closest friends,

33:08.938 --> 33:12.607
but also a part of my family.

33:12.609 --> 33:16.410
And when you broke off
your marriage with Raj,

33:16.412 --> 33:18.546
it was one of the most courageous things

33:18.548 --> 33:20.214
I've ever seen.

33:20.216 --> 33:21.816
And what did it get you?

33:21.818 --> 33:23.251
Your parents cut you off,

33:23.253 --> 33:25.319
and his parents stuck you
with the wedding bill.

33:25.321 --> 33:26.354
It's not right.

33:26.356 --> 33:29.590
Thank you, Evan. Truly.

33:29.592 --> 33:33.161
But friends lending friends
money never ends well.

33:33.163 --> 33:35.930
How about family lending family money?

33:35.932 --> 33:36.931
Worse.

33:36.933 --> 33:37.999
I knew you'd say that,

33:38.001 --> 33:39.167
and I'm nothing if not prepared.

33:39.169 --> 33:41.202
So here's my pitch.

33:41.204 --> 33:43.471
I buy your 1/3 stake in Hankmed.

33:43.473 --> 33:44.472
Evan...

33:44.474 --> 33:46.507
It's not a loan.

33:46.509 --> 33:48.543
That is very generous,

33:48.545 --> 33:51.012
but I brought up selling
my shares to Hank,

33:51.014 --> 33:52.480
and he said that I should keep them.

33:52.482 --> 33:54.148
And I totally agree.

33:54.150 --> 33:55.783
The moment you can buy them
back, they're yours again.

33:55.785 --> 33:59.854
In the meantime, I promise
to take very good care of them.

33:59.856 --> 34:03.724
Just think about it.

34:03.726 --> 34:06.894
You have two minutes.

34:06.896 --> 34:09.330
Thank you for all your help, Dr. Lawson.

34:09.331 --> 34:12.699
We received the report from dispatch.

34:16.705 --> 34:21.475
I'll let you know
as soon as he's in recovery.

34:42.231 --> 34:43.598
Thanks.

34:46.636 --> 34:48.536
Oh, so you got it. I'm so glad.

34:48.538 --> 34:50.103
That's great.

34:50.106 --> 34:51.239
Yeah, I wasn't really sure
of the best means

34:51.241 --> 34:52.473
to get something to you,

34:52.475 --> 34:53.940
so I was going to call your cell phone,

34:53.943 --> 34:56.744
but then I realized I don't even
have your cell phone number,

34:56.746 --> 34:58.412
which is actually kind of funny
if you think about it...

34:58.414 --> 35:00.314
My cousin gave you this?

35:00.316 --> 35:03.084
She did, and she said to give it to you,

35:03.086 --> 35:04.719
which is... which is what I did.

35:04.721 --> 35:06.420
Did you look inside?

35:06.422 --> 35:07.788
I would never. No.

35:07.790 --> 35:11.092
I brought it right to your
security apparatus.

35:11.094 --> 35:12.560
You know, the big scary dudes...

35:12.562 --> 35:14.729
look like they kill people for kicks.

35:14.731 --> 35:17.465
So...

35:17.467 --> 35:18.966
it's not a device, is it?

35:18.968 --> 35:23.638
I mean, it's obviously a device,
but not one that explodes?

35:25.775 --> 35:26.807
Okay.

35:26.809 --> 35:29.577
The newspaper.

35:29.579 --> 35:31.946
So German's actually
one of the many languages

35:31.948 --> 35:33.347
I don't speak.

35:33.349 --> 35:37.551
Mr. Lawson, I have read
that front to back

35:37.553 --> 35:41.589
and have found nothing
that in anyway concerns me.

35:41.591 --> 35:45.660
What exactly did Ms. Von Jurgens
say about its significance?

35:45.662 --> 35:47.662
Nothing, she seemed frustrated

35:47.664 --> 35:49.163
that you didn't take her offer seriously,

35:49.165 --> 35:51.832
and was very intent on me delivering it

35:51.834 --> 35:54.201
to you today after 5:00 P.M.

35:54.203 --> 35:56.203
5:00 P.M.?

35:56.205 --> 35:58.806
Sounded suspicious to me too.

35:58.808 --> 36:02.209
The evening update.

36:02.211 --> 36:05.212
Dieter.

36:11.253 --> 36:14.221
Oh, my God, that's Dieter...

36:14.223 --> 36:17.124
in cuffs.

36:17.126 --> 36:21.262
And he's still wearing his glasses.

36:21.264 --> 36:22.863
Wait a minute. What does this mean?

36:22.865 --> 36:27.802
It means cousin Claudette
is invited to dinner.

36:55.798 --> 36:57.732
Hey.

36:57.734 --> 36:59.233
Hey.

36:59.235 --> 37:02.937
So I just spoke with your doctors.

37:02.939 --> 37:06.073
They're encouraged by the results.

37:06.075 --> 37:07.408
They want to monitor you overnight,

37:07.410 --> 37:10.378
but they hope to release you tomorrow.

37:10.380 --> 37:12.446
It's good news.

37:15.952 --> 37:18.185
But Jack,

37:18.187 --> 37:21.622
it's time to get serious about
dialysis, okay?

37:21.624 --> 37:23.991
This was way too close a call.

37:23.993 --> 37:26.160
Dr. Greene is setting up
your dialysis prep surgery

37:26.162 --> 37:27.828
at Hamptons Heritage.

37:29.165 --> 37:33.467
Hank.

37:33.469 --> 37:36.537
What do you say...

37:36.539 --> 37:40.541
after the surgery, I take you fishing?

37:42.779 --> 37:46.580
Yeah, I'd like that.

37:46.582 --> 37:48.449
Yeah.

37:48.451 --> 37:51.452
Fishing.

38:11.239 --> 38:13.040
You're still here?

38:13.042 --> 38:16.710
Sorry, you're not getting
rid of me so easy.

38:16.712 --> 38:19.914
Hank.

38:19.916 --> 38:23.250
I'm sure...

38:23.252 --> 38:26.587
I'm sure there are more than
enough medical professionals

38:26.589 --> 38:29.957
to keep an eye on me overnight.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.826
I'm sure there are.

38:31.828 --> 38:35.429
I'm not staying as your doctor.

38:35.431 --> 38:37.698
I'm staying as your friend.

38:50.111 --> 38:52.947
Hank, Hank.

38:52.949 --> 38:57.418
Yeah. What's up?

38:57.420 --> 39:01.622
They say that...

39:01.624 --> 39:05.559
if you give a man a fish,
he will eat for day,

39:05.561 --> 39:07.862
but if you...

39:07.864 --> 39:11.499
if you teach a man to fish,

39:11.501 --> 39:14.568
he will sit on a boat
and drink beer all summer.

39:16.672 --> 39:17.905
Is that what they say?

39:19.976 --> 39:22.009
True story.

39:35.023 --> 39:37.525
Thanks for being at the dock.

40:29.210 --> 40:30.477
Thank you for coming.

40:30.479 --> 40:31.878
To say I was surprised by your message

40:31.880 --> 40:35.014
would be an understatement.

40:35.016 --> 40:38.351
It's everything. All of it.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.120
Divya, I know the financial
position you're in.

40:40.122 --> 40:41.354
You don't have to...

40:41.356 --> 40:43.990
I want to. I need to.

40:43.992 --> 40:46.526
I understand.

40:46.528 --> 40:48.728
Thank you for understanding.

40:48.730 --> 40:50.764
And for doing everything you
could to help me with this.

40:50.766 --> 40:54.334
You didn't have to. It means so much.

40:54.336 --> 40:57.103
I wish I could have done more.

41:10.451 --> 41:12.786
Oh, and Raj,

41:12.788 --> 41:14.354
please,

41:14.356 --> 41:16.356
give your parents my regards.

41:16.358 --> 41:18.358
I will.

41:25.432 --> 41:27.400
Hopefully, Hank is finishing
the paperwork,

41:27.402 --> 41:29.135
and we can take Jack
back to Hamptons Heritage.

41:29.137 --> 41:31.171
Let's make sure he gets
the best room in the house.

41:31.173 --> 41:32.839
Every room's the best room.

41:32.841 --> 41:34.073
It's because of you.

41:34.075 --> 41:37.310
Whoever replaces you
has big shoes to fill.

41:37.312 --> 41:39.546
There he is.

41:39.548 --> 41:42.582
- Hank.
- Hey there.

41:42.584 --> 41:46.085
How's Jack?

41:55.129 --> 41:59.599
It happened so fast.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.868
He went septic.

42:06.373 --> 42:08.408
We couldn't get to him.

42:12.379 --> 42:14.914
We lost him.

42:18.886 --> 42:21.187
Jack's dead.
