00:05.046 --> 00:06.338
FRANCES DUFRESNE:
All these human beings...

00:06.338 --> 00:07.797
being rejected in a matter
of seconds.

00:07.797 --> 00:10.171
You're really milking
all the fun out of this.

00:10.713 --> 00:12.588
This is for you, unless it turns
out to have any value.

00:12.588 --> 00:13.755
-Then I'd like it back.

00:13.755 --> 00:15.630
-Sylvia MacDonald.
-I'm trying to find her.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.254
You know, maybe she has
some other work.

00:17.630 --> 00:18.880
SYLVIA MACDONALD:
I keep painting them

00:18.880 --> 00:21.254
and every day I keep realizing
they're shit.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.755
Finish a painting.
For both of us.

00:24.963 --> 00:26.171
Grandpa's in the hospital.

00:26.171 --> 00:28.088
Doctors have recommended
that I get there

00:28.088 --> 00:29.129
as quickly as possible.

00:29.421 --> 00:31.755
Just dealing with my sister
alone is gonna be a ground war.

00:31.755 --> 00:34.380
If I ever hear that you
have upset him,

00:34.380 --> 00:36.338
I will hunt you down.

00:36.713 --> 00:37.922
You're divorced now.
You're free.

00:37.922 --> 00:40.588
I was married forever.
These feelings are...

00:41.380 --> 00:42.963
They're involuntary.

00:51.296 --> 00:52.380
Can you believe it?

00:52.380 --> 00:54.171
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:54.171 --> 00:57.797
- Lila is 13.
- Mm.

00:57.797 --> 01:01.338
I mean, it's your
first family gathering
since the divorce.

01:01.338 --> 01:05.088
- How are you two
getting along?
- Very well, thank you.

01:05.088 --> 01:08.546
We're, um, splitting
birthday duties
very amicably.

01:08.546 --> 01:10.922
Robert is doing
the skating and the invites,

01:10.922 --> 01:14.380
and I'm doing the balloons,
the party favors,
and the cake.

01:14.380 --> 01:17.004
- The soft goods.
- Well, that's nice.

01:17.004 --> 01:19.797
You know, ever since
we slept together in Ohio,

01:19.797 --> 01:21.588
things are
uncomplicated.

01:21.588 --> 01:23.797
- Mm-hmm.

01:23.797 --> 01:26.546
- I detect skepticism.
- Not at all.

01:26.546 --> 01:29.338
Sex that makes things
less complicated,

01:29.338 --> 01:30.713
I hear
about that a lot.

01:30.713 --> 01:32.171
I'm telling you
the truth.

01:32.171 --> 01:36.338
Sleeping with Robert
was the antidote.

01:36.338 --> 01:39.672
Maybe I should try that
as a new couples therapy
technique.

01:39.672 --> 01:41.672
- Mm!
- "The Ohio Method."

01:41.672 --> 01:43.838
- Nice.
- All right,
so what is it gonna be,

01:43.838 --> 01:47.129
this lovely
chocolate buttercream,
carrot cake...?

01:47.129 --> 01:50.296
Okay, truthfully,
Lila likes red velvet.

01:50.296 --> 01:53.171
I like free cake.

01:55.672 --> 01:57.630
Oh, that's cute.

01:57.630 --> 01:59.505
Just email us a picture,
and we'll do the rest.

01:59.505 --> 02:01.922
Ah, yeah.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.213
That might be
a bit challenging

02:03.213 --> 02:05.129
to find a photograph
of Lila smiling,

02:05.129 --> 02:06.672
but it would
be sweet.

02:06.672 --> 02:08.672
Or would she say
that it's cringey?

02:08.672 --> 02:12.296
- It's difficult.
Lots of dynamics.
- Hmm.

02:12.296 --> 02:13.922
Maybe you should
have sex with it

02:13.922 --> 02:15.380
to make it
less complicated.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.338
I apologize.

02:19.338 --> 02:21.213
I will email you
a photograph.

02:24.963 --> 02:27.171
- Bye.
- ( train horn
blaring in distance )

02:38.046 --> 02:38.880
Tom?

02:50.922 --> 02:52.922
Pull over!
Good.

03:08.296 --> 03:09.880
Come on.

03:11.296 --> 03:12.797
- Driving.

03:12.797 --> 03:14.463
Yeah, no,
I can see that.

03:14.463 --> 03:16.213
I can also see
there's no adult with you.

03:16.213 --> 03:18.296
- It's Caleb's.

03:18.296 --> 03:21.713
Caleb, your--
your chem partner?

03:21.713 --> 03:23.755
Well, obviously not Caleb.
It's his dad's.

03:23.755 --> 03:26.546
- No, different--

03:26.546 --> 03:30.546
- it's a different--
a new Caleb.
- Tom, Tom.

03:30.546 --> 03:32.922
You should talk
to Dad.

03:35.463 --> 03:38.004
You follow me, at, like,
10 miles an hour.

03:46.463 --> 03:48.505
( music playing
over speakers )

03:54.463 --> 03:56.546
- Oh, shit, hang on.

03:56.546 --> 03:57.713
- Sorry.

03:57.713 --> 03:59.254
Turn that shit
up, man.

03:59.254 --> 04:00.463
- Up!

04:00.463 --> 04:02.254
- Okay.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.463
Are you into Yes?

04:12.463 --> 04:13.713
What do you think,

04:13.713 --> 04:15.588
I just got here
off a melon truck?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.505
I kissed Jon Anderson once
at Madison Square Garden.

04:18.505 --> 04:22.630
I kissed the lips
that kissed the lips
of Jon Anderson?

04:24.004 --> 04:25.838
Let me taste the magic.

04:25.838 --> 04:27.380
- Mm!

04:34.672 --> 04:37.046
- Is this going on
the birthday mix?

04:37.046 --> 04:39.421
Uh, yes.
Lila can't stand

04:39.421 --> 04:42.463
the top 40 horse shit
they play at the ice rink,

04:42.463 --> 04:43.880
and she's
way into this.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.755
When she was six,
she asked for

04:45.755 --> 04:47.505
"Dark Side of The Moon"
from Santa Claus.

04:47.505 --> 04:49.546
- That's so cool.
- Yeah, I mean, granted,

04:49.546 --> 04:52.004
I've been blasting this at her
since she was in the womb,

04:52.004 --> 04:54.254
- but she's come
around to it on her own.

04:54.254 --> 04:55.588
- That's awesome.

04:55.588 --> 04:59.213
Hey! Not much!
So Mom is outside.

04:59.213 --> 05:01.588
She wants
to talk to you.

05:01.588 --> 05:03.421
I got busted
for driving the Tesla.

05:03.421 --> 05:05.046
!
- Stop!

05:05.046 --> 05:06.713
What do you--
what the f--

05:06.713 --> 05:08.672
what do you mean
you were driving the Tesla?

05:08.672 --> 05:10.380
Oh, God,
that was my fault.

05:10.380 --> 05:13.004
He asked me for the keys
because he said his backpack
was in the back,

05:13.004 --> 05:16.797
- and I gave him--
- That's not your fault,
that's your fucking fault.

05:16.797 --> 05:18.880
I just took it out
of the parking for,
like, one second--

05:18.880 --> 05:22.380
Oh, God,
just cut the bullshit,
sit down right now!

05:22.380 --> 05:24.880
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.296
- I'm just gonna go talk--
- No. No.

05:26.296 --> 05:28.380
You can't meet her
under these circumstances.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.755
That's the worst.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.254
Frances:
Hey! Hey!

05:34.254 --> 05:37.421
I pulled our son over
on Jay Street

05:37.421 --> 05:39.338
by himself,

05:39.338 --> 05:42.588
- driving... that.
- I know.

05:42.588 --> 05:44.797
He was just supposed to
grab his backpack.

05:44.797 --> 05:47.630
And he's in
big trouble now, okay?

05:47.630 --> 05:49.254
I mean,
he's grounded here,

05:49.254 --> 05:51.797
and if you want--
it's your house--

05:51.797 --> 05:54.421
ground-- full-on
double ground.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.421
Yeah, he's
definitely grounded,
definitely.

05:56.421 --> 05:58.546
But how do you
have a Tesla?

05:58.546 --> 06:00.546
I don't.

06:00.546 --> 06:05.046
Um, that is
actually not mine.

06:05.046 --> 06:09.463
It's my...
friend-woman's.

06:09.463 --> 06:12.880
- Yes.

06:14.254 --> 06:16.088
You mean girlfriend?

06:18.254 --> 06:19.213
Yes.

06:22.088 --> 06:24.630
Your girlfriend
has a Tesla?

06:24.630 --> 06:28.004
- She does.
- And you...

06:29.797 --> 06:33.213
- I do.

06:33.213 --> 06:35.755
Does this person
have a name?

06:37.296 --> 06:38.963
Jackie.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.088
- Jackie.

06:41.088 --> 06:42.922
Her name's Jackie.

06:42.922 --> 06:44.672
Our children
have met her?

06:44.672 --> 06:46.213
Well, she has
a daughter

06:46.213 --> 06:48.630
who's approximately
the same age as Tom,

06:48.630 --> 06:50.963
- and they go
to the same school.
- Robert, Robert, Robert!

06:52.088 --> 06:54.046
We-- we have rules.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.463
- No, we don't.
- Okay, fine, we don't
have rules,

06:56.463 --> 06:58.463
but common sense says

06:58.463 --> 07:00.338
you don't
introduce our children

07:00.338 --> 07:02.922
to, like, every
random woman you meet.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.046
She's not
a random woman.

07:05.046 --> 07:06.004
No?

07:06.004 --> 07:08.463
How long
have you known her?

07:10.129 --> 07:12.505
Let me see.

07:14.088 --> 07:16.338
February.

07:16.338 --> 07:17.171
A month.

07:18.505 --> 07:19.880
A month?

07:19.880 --> 07:23.171
So four--
four weeks.

07:23.171 --> 07:25.421
31 days,

07:25.421 --> 07:27.046
depending upon
the month.

07:28.505 --> 07:32.171
'Kay, we've established
the Jackie timeline.

07:32.171 --> 07:34.505
- I'm gonna--
- Okay, you know, that is--

07:34.505 --> 07:36.463
that's silly-fast,
Robert.

07:36.463 --> 07:40.171
Seriously,
it's silly-fast.

07:45.755 --> 07:47.546
Diane:
Thank you all
for coming.

07:47.546 --> 07:50.171
Gather around here.

07:50.171 --> 07:53.380
What makes
Eliot Pelts a master

07:53.380 --> 07:55.546
is his use
of juxtaposition.

07:55.546 --> 07:57.880
Kitsch
and high culture,

07:57.880 --> 08:00.129
religion
and eroticism,

08:00.129 --> 08:02.338
weightlessness
and mass

08:02.338 --> 08:04.129
are just some
of the apparent opposites

08:04.129 --> 08:06.463
that challenge us
in Pelts's work.

08:06.463 --> 08:07.588
I just love it,

08:07.588 --> 08:09.963
which is why I am
the unofficial docent

08:09.963 --> 08:11.838
of "Sky Range 4."

08:14.129 --> 08:15.838
Diane:
Right over there.

08:15.838 --> 08:17.880
- Yeah, sure.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.630
Diane, do you know
what I'm gonna do?

08:26.630 --> 08:30.213
I am gonna
hang two paintings
in the bathroom.

08:30.213 --> 08:32.129
- Mm-hmm, I am,
because you know what,

08:32.129 --> 08:33.755
these people,
they come in here,

08:33.755 --> 08:35.838
they don't really look
at anything on the walls.

08:35.838 --> 08:38.046
They take selfies
in front of you-know-what,

08:38.046 --> 08:41.254
they eat cookies,
and then do stuff
in my bathroom.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.421
So they might as well shop
while they're in there.

08:43.421 --> 08:45.797
Frances,
having a bathroom
that people love to use

08:45.797 --> 08:46.963
is one of the first steps
to having

08:46.963 --> 08:48.421
a multimillion-dollar
business.

08:48.421 --> 08:50.880
I mean,
look at Starbucks!

08:50.880 --> 08:53.463
Ooh, any luck
with the Jackal?

08:53.463 --> 08:56.588
Stop calling her the Jackal.
You make her sound
like a drug lord.

08:56.588 --> 08:59.088
Ugh, if we can't
make up a mean name about
your ex's new girlfriend,

08:59.088 --> 09:00.546
then what's
the point of anything?

09:00.546 --> 09:02.838
Well, I appreciate
your point,

09:02.838 --> 09:06.713
but for now,
if he's happy,
I'm happy.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.797
Oh, my God,
look at this table.

09:08.797 --> 09:10.630
Yuck.

09:10.630 --> 09:12.922
It's just such a cliché.
Men really can't be alone.

09:12.922 --> 09:17.463
Nick proposed to me after
being separated from Carolyn
for barely six months.

09:17.463 --> 09:18.838
It was so pathetic.

09:18.838 --> 09:21.880
Of course, I said yes,
but still, so pathetic.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.630
Look, I could be
with Andrew, you know?

09:24.630 --> 09:28.088
I mean, he texts me
and, you know,

09:28.088 --> 09:30.797
but it's just--
it's not what I'm
looking for right now.

09:30.797 --> 09:32.922
Are you sure?
He's so cute.

09:32.922 --> 09:36.546
No, I'm sure the only person
I am looking for right now
is Sylvia,

09:36.546 --> 09:39.254
- and she won't
return my calls.
- Hmm, playing hard to get.

09:39.254 --> 09:41.004
See, now that's
not pathetic.

09:47.213 --> 09:50.713
So what do you think about
your dad and my mom fucking?

09:50.713 --> 09:52.838
Oh! I, um--

09:52.838 --> 09:54.838
- I hadn't
thought about it.

09:54.838 --> 09:56.838
You're cute.

09:56.838 --> 09:58.046
What are you
doing now?

09:58.046 --> 10:01.588
I don't know.
Where are you going?

10:01.588 --> 10:04.004
Hmm, somewhere
more fun than this.

10:11.004 --> 10:12.421
Well, here you are!

10:12.421 --> 10:14.505
Nick, this is
Jackie Giannopoulos.

10:14.505 --> 10:15.963
- Hi.
- Welcome, Jackie.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.505
Robert has told me
nothing about you

10:18.505 --> 10:20.797
other than you like
pizza capricciosa.

10:20.797 --> 10:22.254
If it has carbs,
I eat it.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.505
A woman after
my own large intestine.

10:24.505 --> 10:26.338
Come on in.

10:26.338 --> 10:31.088
Robert built
my new pizza oven
with his manly hands,

10:31.088 --> 10:33.129
so I thought
he should be here
for the trial run

10:33.129 --> 10:35.963
so I have somebody to blame,
you know, if the pizza sucks.

10:35.963 --> 10:38.004
- Diane, our guests are here!

10:39.672 --> 10:42.129
- Robert!

10:44.254 --> 10:47.880
Good. Diane, this is
Jackie Giannopoulos.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.922
- I have heard
so much about you.

10:50.922 --> 10:52.505
That's so interesting
'cause I--

10:52.505 --> 10:54.046
I've heard nothing
about you.

10:54.046 --> 10:56.129
I didn't even--
honey, you didn't tell me

10:56.129 --> 10:57.963
that Robert was gonna be
our dinner guest tonight,

10:57.963 --> 11:01.213
or that he was bringing
the Jack-- Jackie.

11:01.213 --> 11:03.463
- I left
a message on your cell.
- Oh, for God sakes,

11:03.463 --> 11:05.588
I haven't listened
to that thing in two years.

11:05.588 --> 11:07.672
- Well, good!
Well, here,

11:07.672 --> 11:10.046
can you put these
in water for me, darling?

11:10.046 --> 11:11.630
And why don't you two
come on in?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.004
Make yourselves
comfortable!

11:13.004 --> 11:16.213
We can have
a little cocktail.

11:16.213 --> 11:19.630
I need to pull my dough.
I'll be in in a minute.

11:23.129 --> 11:26.630
So, I love your style.
You're very chic.

11:26.630 --> 11:28.672
Thank you.
I love your lighting.

11:28.672 --> 11:31.588
- It's very forgiving.
- Well, anyone over
the age of 12

11:31.588 --> 11:33.630
needs to understand
the importance of a dimmer.

11:33.630 --> 11:36.922
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, right after
Jackie bought my house,

11:36.922 --> 11:38.922
she went around
and she took

11:38.922 --> 11:41.797
all the good, clear bulbs
out of the fixtures

11:41.797 --> 11:44.004
and she started
putting in these weird,

11:44.004 --> 11:45.755
like, cloudy...

11:45.755 --> 11:48.922
- Frosted opaque.
- ...bulbs.

11:48.922 --> 11:51.963
Yeah, I couldn't see
my hand in front of
my face, Diane.

11:51.963 --> 11:57.088
- I walked into a wall!
- I thought that's because
you were so taken with me.

11:57.088 --> 11:58.254
Robert:
All right it was.

12:00.338 --> 12:02.546
And I also
taught him the importance

12:02.546 --> 12:05.213
of a well-placed candle,
haven't I, Robbie?

12:05.213 --> 12:07.797
- Yeah.

12:07.797 --> 12:11.129
I hate it,
but I'm going with it
because she's so fucking hot.

12:14.546 --> 12:16.922
Wine!
I think
you need wine!

12:16.922 --> 12:19.463
Diane, could I get
a Moscow mule?

12:19.463 --> 12:21.880
A Moscow mule
for Robbie

12:21.880 --> 12:25.838
- and wine for the Jackie.
- Thank you.

12:25.838 --> 12:28.254
Knock, knock.
Jeez!

12:28.254 --> 12:31.254
Do you have
a physical ailment
that prevents you from smiling?

12:31.254 --> 12:34.963
Just need one,
sweet picture

12:34.963 --> 12:36.797
for the cake, okay?
You ready?

12:38.171 --> 12:41.171
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

12:41.171 --> 12:44.546
Not your parents
'cause they don't knock.

12:46.338 --> 12:48.380
That's so dumb.

12:48.380 --> 12:49.922
Oh, my God!

12:49.922 --> 12:52.838
So gorgeous!
Look that at that
almost-13-year-old.

12:55.088 --> 12:56.797
Sorry,
hold on a second.

12:56.797 --> 12:59.421
Hello?
No, no, no, no!
Wait, wait!

12:59.421 --> 13:01.171
Sorry.
- Diane: She's here!

13:01.171 --> 13:03.797
- The Jackal is here.

13:03.797 --> 13:05.713
- In my house.

13:05.713 --> 13:07.838
Robert brought her
to dinner.

13:07.838 --> 13:09.254
Oh, my God,
I can't breathe.

13:09.254 --> 13:11.171
Well, that's like...

13:12.755 --> 13:14.088
that's trespassing.

13:14.088 --> 13:15.838
- Well, it's hostile.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.213
That's a hostile
takeover of my friends.

13:18.213 --> 13:20.963
- I don't know, show off,
I guess.

13:20.963 --> 13:22.380
But honestly,
I wouldn't worry about it.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.546
I mean, she's not you,
trust me.

13:24.546 --> 13:27.338
What is she like?
Like--

13:27.338 --> 13:29.129
what are they--
what are they like?

13:29.129 --> 13:33.129
I don't know,
I mean, I guess
they're kind of cute.

13:33.129 --> 13:34.922
They kind of
banter back and forth.

13:34.922 --> 13:37.838
I suppose-- I suppose
she's attractive?

13:37.838 --> 13:40.963
Mm, beachy.
Kind of beachy,
beachy hair.

13:40.963 --> 13:43.630
- Oh, my God.
- Blonde, super shiny.

13:43.630 --> 13:46.880
- Oh, and she wearing a fedora.
- Women who wear hats,
very specific.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.797
I know,
and she actually
looks good in it.

13:48.797 --> 13:51.588
God, if I wore a fedora,
I'd look like Mickey Rourke.

13:51.588 --> 13:54.463
Oh, and get this,
she calls him Robbie.

13:54.463 --> 13:56.755
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

13:56.755 --> 13:59.129
And Robbie is wearing
a leather jacket,

13:59.129 --> 14:00.546
Robbie has paste
in his hair,

14:00.546 --> 14:02.630
and Robbie is wearing
a leather necklace!

14:02.630 --> 14:05.421
!
- Although, I might've
made that part up, actually.

14:05.421 --> 14:07.213
My God,
who is this woman?

14:07.213 --> 14:09.129
Oh, I have great idea.

14:09.129 --> 14:11.546
Okay, I'm gonna hang up,
but check your phone
in 30 seconds, okay?

14:11.546 --> 14:12.963
Okay, okay.

14:23.338 --> 14:24.713
Perfect.

14:28.004 --> 14:30.380
- Got it.

14:30.380 --> 14:33.421
- Send, send, send.

14:33.421 --> 14:34.588
Wine!

14:44.463 --> 14:46.755
Thanks for nothing,
Diane.

15:14.588 --> 15:16.129
What the fuck are you doing?
You're insane.

15:16.129 --> 15:17.922
Oh, my God.

15:17.922 --> 15:20.380
So, uh, what do you
think of Jackie?

15:20.380 --> 15:23.171
- Oh, she's terrific!

15:23.171 --> 15:25.004
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

15:25.004 --> 15:26.838
- It's like I hit
the fucking lottery.
- Mm-hmm.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.838
I mean, I really--
I thought I was gonna
be out there

15:28.838 --> 15:30.338
shaking the tree
for a while,

15:30.338 --> 15:32.088
going to
Knicks games alone,

15:32.088 --> 15:34.546
meeting other women,
fucking up.

15:34.546 --> 15:37.338
And then Jackie
just sneaks up on me.

15:37.338 --> 15:39.838
I think she's really
something special.

15:39.838 --> 15:42.963
I met Diane at
the glove counter at Saks.

15:42.963 --> 15:45.046
I bought gloves
for my wife,

15:45.046 --> 15:48.672
and I was done
with my wife

15:48.672 --> 15:50.880
and my search
for true love

15:50.880 --> 15:53.171
and, I guess,
my search for gloves.

15:53.171 --> 15:56.797
I haven't
introduced her
to Frances yet.

15:56.797 --> 15:59.046
That's
the next hurdle.

15:59.046 --> 16:01.296
I think it could be
a little dicey.

16:01.296 --> 16:03.171
Yeah, that's
a terrible idea.

16:03.171 --> 16:06.630
I'm gonna handle this
like a peace treaty,
you know?

16:06.630 --> 16:10.046
Frances over here,
Jackie over here,

16:10.046 --> 16:13.963
me right in the middle
with a big smile on my face.

16:13.963 --> 16:16.338
I'm gonna keep things
light and airy.

16:16.338 --> 16:18.880
Maybe even do it
from a moving car.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.254
Maybe just don't even
do it at all.

16:21.254 --> 16:23.129
See this scar?

16:23.129 --> 16:27.672
That's from the first time
Carolyn met Diane
at the movies.

16:27.672 --> 16:29.797
"Jurassic Park 3D."

16:29.797 --> 16:32.880
Wouldn't think
those flimsy glasses
could break skin.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.046
Huh.

16:34.046 --> 16:37.380
Never thought of Carolyn
as a stabber.

16:37.380 --> 16:38.672
They all are.

16:38.672 --> 16:40.171
Fuck.

16:49.546 --> 16:51.296
- Hi, Frances.

16:51.296 --> 16:52.588
Frances:
Hey, listen to me--

16:52.588 --> 16:56.672
Robert has brought
his new girlfriend

16:56.672 --> 16:58.588
over to Nick
and Diane's house.

16:58.588 --> 17:01.004
Now, Diane
always sees the good,

17:01.004 --> 17:03.254
so I need you
to go over there right now,

17:03.254 --> 17:06.421
and see
something bad, okay?

17:06.421 --> 17:09.546
I see the "Ohio Method"
still has some kinks
to work out.

17:09.546 --> 17:12.546
I appreciate
your faith in me.
I'm on it.

17:12.546 --> 17:15.713
You're true blue.
Bye.

17:17.088 --> 17:20.088
Oh, I don't have to
freaking run anymore.

17:20.088 --> 17:22.171
It was 100K
off the asking.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.338
Anyway,
I thought to myself,
"Who is this crazy woman?"

17:25.338 --> 17:27.463
Well, now this crazy woman
owns your house.

17:27.463 --> 17:31.296
- Aw, you do own my house.
- You two are so cute.

17:31.296 --> 17:34.630
- Did you invite someone
without telling me?

17:34.630 --> 17:36.505
I left a message
on your cell.

17:36.505 --> 17:37.963
Oh, did you?

17:42.505 --> 17:45.004
- Hey, I was
spring cleaning

17:45.004 --> 17:48.046
and I found Nick's bowl,
so I thought I would
return it.

17:48.046 --> 17:50.088
Where is she?

17:50.088 --> 17:52.922
We're just
finishing up pizza.

17:52.922 --> 17:55.755
- Look who's here!

17:55.755 --> 17:57.421
Jackie?

17:57.421 --> 18:00.296
Robbie.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.838
Dallas?

18:01.838 --> 18:04.213
Wait,
how do you know...?

18:04.213 --> 18:06.463
This is crazy.
Dallas is my shrink.

18:06.463 --> 18:07.338
Hey!

18:09.254 --> 18:10.922
What a funny

18:10.922 --> 18:15.046
and a-an extremely
unethical coincidence
this is.

18:15.046 --> 18:17.463
I, uh...

18:18.880 --> 18:21.338
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna go home now.

18:24.254 --> 18:25.880
Was that
my mixing bowl?

18:35.505 --> 18:36.797
Dal?

18:38.296 --> 18:40.004
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

18:43.171 --> 18:44.838
- Hey!
- Dallas: Hey.

18:44.838 --> 18:48.171
You know, uh, I can't
be late for my train.

18:48.171 --> 18:50.129
I called you
all last night.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.963
I called you again
this morning.

18:51.963 --> 18:54.546
- Frances, I can't.

18:54.546 --> 18:57.213
- I can't talk
about her.

18:57.213 --> 18:59.505
Oh, my God,
you couldn't
make this up.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.296
You're more likely
to get struck by lightning

19:01.296 --> 19:03.755
or crushed in
an elevator shaft.

19:05.838 --> 19:07.713
She's my patient.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.713
Jackie
is my patient.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.254
I'm her therapist.

19:11.254 --> 19:13.004
What?

19:14.213 --> 19:15.797
That's fantastic!

19:15.797 --> 19:17.546
No, it's not.

19:17.546 --> 19:19.713
No. Oh, my God,
is she the patient
that has, um,

19:19.713 --> 19:23.171
t-the Tricho-- you know,
the thing where

19:23.171 --> 19:26.254
- Frances, I can't
talk about her!

19:26.254 --> 19:27.963
I mean,
it just violates
every tenet

19:27.963 --> 19:30.213
of doctor-patient
confidentiality.

19:30.213 --> 19:31.880
And now I'm screwed.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.421
I have to break up
with her.

19:33.421 --> 19:35.088
I've lost a client.

19:35.088 --> 19:37.254
Oh.

19:37.254 --> 19:38.713
Oh, my God,
I'm sorry.

19:38.713 --> 19:42.088
I'm so sorry.
Really, really, I am.

19:42.088 --> 19:46.588
But now, you know,
you're free to tell me
everything, right?

19:46.588 --> 19:48.963
Why? Why do you
really wanna know?

19:48.963 --> 19:53.421
Why do you really not
want to tell me?

19:53.421 --> 19:55.254
Because nothing good
will come of it.

19:55.254 --> 19:57.129
The more you know,
the more you're gonna
wanna know.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.713
Trust me.
I once Googled
Turner's new wife.

19:59.713 --> 20:01.254
I ended up a day later
on Pinterest

20:01.254 --> 20:04.171
obsessing about
her sister's new
kitchen remodel.

20:04.171 --> 20:06.254
Oh, oh, my.

20:06.254 --> 20:08.254
- Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
- ( train horn blaring
in distance )

20:08.254 --> 20:09.880
No, no, no.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.254
You should-- you-- go.
Catch your train.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.129
- All right.
- Okay.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.588
Very wise.

20:25.296 --> 20:27.254
Is she
a good therapist?

20:27.254 --> 20:29.004
I've known Dallas
a long time.

20:29.004 --> 20:31.129
- She's batshit.
- No, she's great.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.672
She's super smart
and empathetic.

20:33.672 --> 20:35.672
Oh, so she
brainwashed you.

20:41.463 --> 20:43.171
Nope, I'm good.

20:43.171 --> 20:45.380
- Mm.
- You know
you can answer that.

20:45.380 --> 20:48.254
- No, it's okay.
- What if it's about
one of your kids?

20:50.046 --> 20:51.922
Yeah, you're right.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.672
Hello?

20:57.672 --> 20:58.838
Hey, Frances.

21:00.380 --> 21:01.296
Uh-huh.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.797
What?

21:04.797 --> 21:09.421
Uh, sh-- ah,
it's an idea.

21:09.421 --> 21:12.338
Okay,
I'll give it
a "tink."

21:12.338 --> 21:14.630
All right,
have a nice day.

21:21.922 --> 21:24.546
- Nothing.

21:24.546 --> 21:26.672
Nothing at all.

21:26.672 --> 21:29.338
Yeah, she was
on her way to--

21:29.338 --> 21:32.380
oh, you know what,
I just had a thought.

21:32.380 --> 21:33.838
Um, no pressure.

21:33.838 --> 21:35.338
Do you think
you'd be interested

21:35.338 --> 21:37.088
in going to Lila's
birthday party?

21:37.088 --> 21:39.213
Did Frances
just invite me?

21:39.213 --> 21:42.880
- Maybe.
- Well, I
would love to come,

21:42.880 --> 21:45.046
but I do not wanna
stress you out.

21:45.046 --> 21:47.546
Me? Oh, no.

21:47.546 --> 21:48.922
I'd be thrilled!

21:48.922 --> 21:51.922
I mean, no,
there's nothing cooler.

21:51.922 --> 21:54.254
And not just because
it's an ice skating party.

21:54.254 --> 21:56.838
Robbie, don't worry.
She's gonna like me.

21:56.838 --> 21:58.380
Most people do.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.922
It's a loading zone.
Do you see me unloading?

22:00.922 --> 22:02.755
!
- You need to move.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.463
I will,
just when I've finished
unloading everything.

22:04.463 --> 22:06.213
Could you
pick up the pace?

22:06.213 --> 22:07.755
Oh, my God,
you did it!

22:07.755 --> 22:10.213
- You did it!
- I've been here
three minutes.

22:10.213 --> 22:12.630
Oh, God!
Are these--
they're all finished?

22:12.630 --> 22:14.922
- Yes.
- More like 15,
but who's counting?

22:14.922 --> 22:17.046
- Move!
- Oh, my God,
she finished her painting.

22:17.046 --> 22:19.546
For the love of God,
Marla, let her unload!

22:28.296 --> 22:29.755
They're stunning.

22:34.254 --> 22:35.838
They're stunning!

22:35.838 --> 22:38.463
I really--
I just-- I can't--

22:38.463 --> 22:40.046
I really can't
believe you did this.

22:40.046 --> 22:42.672
I mean, I'm looking
at them, but I'm...

22:42.672 --> 22:44.755
So one, two,
three, four,

22:44.755 --> 22:47.088
and the one
I have already,
that's five.

22:47.088 --> 22:48.880
Okay, listen,
I don't wanna
freak you out,

22:48.880 --> 22:52.380
but if you could
paint a few more,
we have a show.

22:52.380 --> 22:56.254
- I'm not doing a show.
- Oh, Sylvia, can we, really--
can we not do this again?

22:56.254 --> 22:57.922
I'm busy,
you're in
a loading zone.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.338
Oh, pay no attention
to that if possible.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.797
- Come on, come on.
- This place isn't bad.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.171
- A barn or something.

23:08.171 --> 23:10.963
No, it's not
a barn.

23:10.963 --> 23:12.421
It's nice.

23:14.213 --> 23:17.129
But it would be
a whole lot nicer

23:17.129 --> 23:21.713
if this entire wall

23:21.713 --> 23:27.338
was covered in the works
of Sylvia MacDonald.

23:27.338 --> 23:29.296
There's no way I could
do more paintings.

23:29.296 --> 23:30.463
I'll give you a month.

23:36.713 --> 23:39.129
- We're gonna end up...
- Thank you!

23:39.129 --> 23:41.004
- Aw, thanks!
- You're welcome!

23:41.004 --> 23:43.505
- Yeah!

23:43.505 --> 23:44.838
Let's go!

23:44.838 --> 23:46.421
- Hit the ice!

23:46.421 --> 23:49.380
- Don't go fast.
No hotdogging.
- Okay!

23:49.380 --> 23:51.797
Beep-beep!
Beep-beep!

23:55.463 --> 23:58.004
- This is fun,
isn't it?
- Yeah!

23:59.505 --> 24:03.338
Have you-- have you seen
Dad or Jackie yet?

24:03.338 --> 24:04.922
No, I haven't
seen them.

24:04.922 --> 24:07.922
There are a lot
of good skaters
here tonight.

24:07.922 --> 24:12.880
You know, even though
I helped co-plan
a skating party,

24:12.880 --> 24:15.171
I just don't feel
like skating tonight.

24:15.171 --> 24:16.421
Why?

24:16.421 --> 24:18.338
'Cause I don't
know how to.

24:21.838 --> 24:23.129
Is that Frances?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.672
It is.
Let me wave her over.

24:24.672 --> 24:25.963
- No, I'll just go say hi.
- Fra--!

24:25.963 --> 24:28.505
No, Jackie!
No! Jackie!

24:28.505 --> 24:30.046
No one on the ice
without skates, man.

24:31.463 --> 24:33.213
Oh, really, dude?

24:33.213 --> 24:36.713
- Oh, there's Tiffany
and Rachel.
- Oh. Okay.

24:36.713 --> 24:39.922
- Have-- whoops.
Have fun!
- Jackie!

24:41.630 --> 24:43.505
Hey, Frances.

24:43.505 --> 24:46.421
- I'm Jackie.
- Hi, Jackie.

24:46.421 --> 24:48.421
Hi.
Thanks for coming.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.880
- Whoo! Sorry.
- Thank you for the invite.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.838
It was very--
it was big of you.

24:52.838 --> 24:54.713
Not big like--

24:54.713 --> 24:59.713
- I'm, uh-- I'm suddenly
very weirded out.

24:59.713 --> 25:04.546
Gosh, I'm-- I'm finding
this entire situation

25:04.546 --> 25:07.588
- incredibly comfortable.

25:07.588 --> 25:10.755
- No one will know.
- Man.

25:10.755 --> 25:12.588
Just put on
some skates.

25:12.588 --> 25:14.296
And for the whole
Tom car thing,

25:14.296 --> 25:15.797
I just--
I'm so sorry.

25:15.797 --> 25:18.421
It was such a horrible way
for us to start out.

25:18.421 --> 25:19.630
No, no, no,
really.

25:19.630 --> 25:21.797
How would you know
that I birthed a felon?

25:21.797 --> 25:26.338
- But that is only
his second felony.
- Man, come on, dude.

25:26.338 --> 25:30.088
- And Tom just seems like
he wanted to have some fun.

25:30.088 --> 25:32.588
- Yeah.
- He and Robert
seem so alike.

25:32.588 --> 25:34.254
Really?

25:34.254 --> 25:37.171
God, I don't see that.
I don't know.

25:37.171 --> 25:42.380
Tom is so, um,
steady, you know,
and he's resilient.

25:42.380 --> 25:46.088
And Robert is
much more like Lila,

25:46.088 --> 25:48.088
you know,
very emotional,

25:48.088 --> 25:51.546
you know,
and very sensitive.

25:51.546 --> 25:54.546
You know,
I think Ohio
almost leveled him.

25:54.546 --> 25:58.129
- Yeah, it was so great
that you were with him.
- Well, yeah, of course.

25:58.129 --> 26:01.630
You know, even though
we're, you know-- we're...

26:01.630 --> 26:03.296
- that way and that way...
- Mm-hmm.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.171
...I still, obviously--
I care about him.

26:05.171 --> 26:07.129
Of course.
I mean, you wouldn't
sleep together again

26:07.129 --> 26:08.588
if you still didn't
care about each other.

26:08.588 --> 26:12.296
Oh, he--
he told you that?

26:12.296 --> 26:14.922
Yeah!
I mean, it was not
the greatest thing to hear,

26:14.922 --> 26:17.588
but he said
it didn't mean anything.

26:17.588 --> 26:20.672
He said it was
a really intense time,
so I get it.

26:20.672 --> 26:22.797
Yeah.

26:22.797 --> 26:25.129
Yeah, it was--
it was intense.

26:25.129 --> 26:27.713
The truth is I probably
should be thanking you.

26:27.713 --> 26:31.463
For
For sleeping with him?

26:31.463 --> 26:32.797
No.

26:32.797 --> 26:34.546
For divorcing him.

26:34.546 --> 26:36.380
Oh.

26:36.380 --> 26:39.171
Well, my pleasure.

26:48.004 --> 26:49.505
- Good.

26:49.505 --> 26:52.088

Let's go find the DJ.

DIANE: Hey Frances,
how you and Andrew doing?

30:34.171 --> 30:35.713
Things are more serious
with my mailman.

30:35.713 --> 30:37.380
You've got more layers
to you than I thought.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.004
How many layers
did you think I had?

30:39.004 --> 30:40.088
Two, three.

30:41.254 --> 30:43.630
She's my daughter.
She doesn't need a dad.

30:43.630 --> 30:45.755
We just got our
kyu brown belts in Aikido.

30:45.755 --> 30:48.630
So, we're all going
Kung Fu fighting?

30:50.004 --> 30:51.588
We should talk about consent.

Let's say that a girl
wanted to kiss your penis--

30:53.588 --> 30:54.755
-Mom!
-You know--

30:54.755 --> 30:56.713
All right-- Just--
No means no!
