Here is it.
(groaning)

00:26.625 --> 00:30.417
Oh! That is disgusting!
That is some ratchet shit.

00:30.417 --> 00:32.417
Oh, my God.
That looks like
a gnarled root.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.625
(laughter)
You have to rethink premed

00:34.625 --> 00:38.041
if you can't handle looking
at an erect penis!

00:38.041 --> 00:40.917
Erect? What kind of doctor
are you trying to be?
Let me see.

00:40.917 --> 00:44.834
Oh, that is so gross.
Why? Why would anybody
wanna look at that?

00:44.834 --> 00:47.083
No! That's what he sent her
after she broke up with him.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.583
She broke up with him?
That's aggro.

00:48.583 --> 00:50.208
She broke up with him?
Yeah.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.917
She was gonna get weed
for me from him.

00:51.917 --> 00:53.708
Oh, that is not gonna
happen anymore.

00:53.708 --> 00:56.959
How do you even study stoned?
I don't know. I'm a genius?

00:56.959 --> 00:58.917
Oh, she's a genius.
That's what we were missing.

00:58.917 --> 01:00.959
It doesn't mess anything up,
so just let me...

01:00.959 --> 01:03.125

01:03.125 --> 01:05.417
I need to pick up my cousin

I gotta go too.
I'll walk with you.

01:07.125 --> 01:10.000
Okay, sounds good.
Bye, girl.
All: Bye!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.875
Why does Chantal
have that picture?

01:11.875 --> 01:14.792
I was wondering
the same thing.
She's keeping that dick pic.

01:14.792 --> 01:17.083
Here.

01:17.083 --> 01:20.250
It's okay, I guess.
You don't know anything.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.625
Go pick whatever
you want, okay?

01:23.625 --> 01:25.375
And get me a drink, yeah?
Yeah!

01:25.375 --> 01:26.458
You can choose.

01:26.458 --> 01:28.500
Um, can I have a pack
of those guys over there?

01:28.500 --> 01:30.333
Can I see your ID?
Yeah.

01:37.625 --> 01:40.333
You need to be 21
to buy cigarettes.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.750
Really? Oh, well,
I'm from Texas.

01:42.750 --> 01:45.458
You only have
to be 18 there, so...

01:45.458 --> 01:51.083
Can you make an exception
for me just this once, please?

01:51.083 --> 01:53.000
You don't look that tall.
I am that tall.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.208
But you don't look that!
The half is very important.

01:55.208 --> 01:58.166
I am five-three and a half.
Well, well,
you may be five-three, but--

01:58.166 --> 01:59.542
No, I don't think so.
Baba!

01:59.542 --> 02:02.542
Hey.
(speaks Urdu)

02:04.041 --> 02:06.875

My biology professor hates us.

02:08.041 --> 02:10.125
You can handle it.
How were your classes?

02:10.125 --> 02:12.750
Same as always. It looks
like my students hate me.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.166
I got a 98 on my Mandarin.
Very good. Very good.

from the masjid, so I'm sorry.

02:21.750 --> 02:25.708

a little bit of help on.
I'll help you with the fish lab.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.083
Sorry.
What's that smell, baba?

02:35.083 --> 02:38.250
That smell?
(speaks Urdu) Okay?

02:38.250 --> 02:40.500
Every time you get
that smell, you walk
the other way.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.291
Well, I smell it
in the hallway all the time.

02:42.291 --> 02:44.166
So good, now you know...
(mother speaks on phone)

02:44.166 --> 02:45.208
Sorry.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.458
Just pass it over.

02:48.458 --> 02:52.417
Beta  , you can remove
the head thing. We're home.
I like it, though.

We talked, like, God,
twice already today.

better to do with her time.

I'm sure we'll be the same
when Nasim goes to college.

03:09.083 --> 03:11.417
Maybe I can go
to Texas A&M and live
with Khaloo  and  Khala?

03:11.417 --> 03:15.083
Oh, they'd actually love that.
You'd be their dream daughter,
Nasim.

you're gonna actually
let her live in the dorms?

Oh, no, man.
I haven't sold
E since college,

16:55.458 --> 16:58.166
but, uh, I sell mushrooms.
They're fun.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.417
I'm doing them tomorrow
for my birthday actually.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.250
Uh, I don't think we're
really a 'shrooms crowd.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.208
Oh, did you hear that?
It's his birthday too.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.667
A couple of Scorpios.
Oh, really?

17:07.667 --> 17:09.959
What year? Whoa.
Uh, '84.

17:09.959 --> 17:12.208
(gasps) Holy shit!
You're a baby.

17:12.208 --> 17:15.291
Oh, no. I don't think so.
This is really
quite the beard.

17:15.291 --> 17:17.959
Can I grab it?
Uh...

17:17.959 --> 17:20.959
Uh, well, yeah. Go for it.

17:20.959 --> 17:25.000
(gasps) It feels
like pubic hair.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.583
Y-- yeah, I guess it does.
Thanks.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.458
Is that weird?
No, it's not weird.

17:30.458 --> 17:34.375
I was actually thinking,
yeah, that is what my
pubic hair feels like, so...

17:34.375 --> 17:36.959
Was that weird? I just ate
a pot cookie about an hour ago,

17:36.959 --> 17:40.625
so I think it's kicking in,
if I can be honest.
(dryer buzzes)

17:40.625 --> 17:44.291
My--
Weed nuts. Thoughts?

17:44.291 --> 17:47.959
Um, you know, I actually
don't do a lot of cooking,

17:47.959 --> 17:51.250
but the main rule with edibles
is just don't eat too much.

17:51.250 --> 17:54.708
Hey, if you get off
work early tomorrow
and you don't have any plans,

17:54.708 --> 17:57.250
you should come by
and celebrate
your birthday with us.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.208
Oh, that's very nice.
Thank you. Yeah, maybe--

18:00.208 --> 18:02.291
Yeah. Bring your wife.

18:02.291 --> 18:05.667
Oh, yeah. Um, yeah.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.834
Maybe I will. I work till,
like, 11:30 usually, so...

18:08.834 --> 18:10.375
That's okay. We go late.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.333
Okay.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.333
Well, then have a good time.
Maybe I'll see you.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.375
Don't eat too many nuts.
Got it.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.625
Happy birthday. Later, guys!
Thanks for the invite.

18:19.625 --> 18:22.667
Same to you.
(grinder whirring)

18:23.917 --> 18:26.959
What the fuck, Gi?
Why did you do that?

18:26.959 --> 18:30.834
What?
He doesn't want to hang
with us on his birthday.

18:30.834 --> 18:33.834
Oh, you don't know that.
Well, you have to think
about everybody else.

18:33.834 --> 18:35.417
They don't know him.
He-- We don't know him.

18:35.417 --> 18:37.583
Nobody knows Colin and Becky.
They're coming.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.667
What? Why the fuck...
(scoffs, sighs)

18:40.667 --> 18:43.333
...did you invite them
to my birthday?
Oh, God, Leo.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.667
Leo, Colin is
actually my friend.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.708
I know that,
and I am cool with that,

18:49.708 --> 18:51.500
but I just think
you should ask me--

18:51.500 --> 18:53.542
What the fuck
is your problem?

18:56.542 --> 18:58.542
(sighs, mutters)

18:58.542 --> 19:01.375
Gigi:
Jesus Christ. Then change.

19:01.375 --> 19:04.500
I mean, don't dress up.
Dress up. Wear normal clothes.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.041
Who the fuck cares, Leo?

19:06.041 --> 19:08.625
I'm not going to be
some contrary asshole
in street wear

19:08.625 --> 19:11.542
just because it's my birthday.
Street wear?

19:11.542 --> 19:14.041
You think you're not
an asshole when it's
not your birthday?

19:14.041 --> 19:15.875
Nice double negative.
Yeah, nice shitty attitude.

19:15.875 --> 19:19.625
Don't you do this!
This is so fucked right now!

19:19.625 --> 19:21.875
(sighs)

19:21.875 --> 19:23.959
Fuck it. I... Goddamn it.
I'm gonna cancel.

19:23.959 --> 19:26.375
I'm gonna email everybody,
and I'm gonna tell them

19:26.375 --> 19:29.417
it's over, that we're sick.
I wouldn't be wrong, would I?

19:29.417 --> 19:32.583
Yeah. Oh, now you want to tell
people we've got the clap?

19:32.583 --> 19:35.250
The clap is gonorrhea.
Get your shit straight.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.708
Well, I'm glad I spent $150
on this fucking cake then,

19:37.708 --> 19:41.125
in addition to everything else
you see laid before you.
I didn't ask you to do anything.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.708
Would it kill you
to notice my throw pillows?

19:42.708 --> 19:44.166
Excuse me for living
halfway to a hundred.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.250
Oh, okay.
You know what?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.291
(doorbell buzzes)

19:46.291 --> 19:49.083
Who... Fifteen minutes
early to a party?

19:49.083 --> 19:51.166
Who fucking does this?
I hate this.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.708
Hello?
Colin (on intercom):
Hey! It's Colin and Becky!

19:53.708 --> 19:57.333
Sorry we're a bit early.
Oh, that's okay!
Come on up!

19:57.333 --> 19:58.542
I'm changing into pants!

19:58.542 --> 20:00.166
Man:
No, I'm telling you,

20:00.166 --> 20:01.750
if you had told me
ten years ago

20:01.750 --> 20:04.917
that a one bedroom
shithole in Greenpoint

20:04.917 --> 20:07.208
would go for
two million dollars,
I would have, you know,

20:07.208 --> 20:09.500
I would have bought a couple
of one bedroom shitholes

20:09.500 --> 20:11.625
in Greenpoint, you know?
You were smart to buy

20:11.625 --> 20:13.959
what you did when you did.
Can we stop talking
about real estate?

20:13.959 --> 20:16.166
It is seriously so boring.
I know no one wants
to talk about it,

20:16.166 --> 20:18.291
but he's on the spectrum, right?
Nobody wants to say anything.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.125
Okay, right.
But why don't they
just get him tested?

20:20.125 --> 20:21.458
They're afraid of the results.

20:21.458 --> 20:22.750
I'm just worried
about my daughter.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.291
Wish she'd stop wetting
the fucking bed.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.667
She's in the fifth
fucking grade.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.875
Oh, that's a beautiful tunic.
It's a jalaba.

20:27.875 --> 20:29.875
Oh!
I got it
in Morocco last winter.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.500
I'm dying to go to Morocco,
but every time we get a break,

20:32.500 --> 20:34.667
we have to go
visit Colin's family.
It's great.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.125
Mm.
They have amazing textiles.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.000
Yeah, I know.
I went nuts buying fabric.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.625
Why don't you get Rachel Comey
to send you over there?

20:40.625 --> 20:44.792
Oh, well, I wish she would,
but I think it's more likely
she's gonna send me to LA.

20:44.792 --> 20:48.041
We're opening a store.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not fun.

20:48.041 --> 20:51.375
Well, I kind of like LA.
I've lived here my whole life,

20:51.375 --> 20:53.500
so at some point--
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.583
You're not taking
my Colin way from me.
We just got financing!

20:56.583 --> 21:00.125
Well, uh... I was
just telling her about LA.
Just a nascent idea.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.333
It's not.
Can I, um, top anyone off?

21:02.333 --> 21:05.291
I'm good.
I love this.

21:05.291 --> 21:07.625
Oh, this? Thank you.
God.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.291
You know where I got this?
Where?

21:09.291 --> 21:11.708
You know where
we were scouting
the other day, off Atlantic?

21:11.708 --> 21:13.250
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I went back there.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.875
You didn't go back.
Mm-hm. It was awesome.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.834
And, uh, then I made
the gross mistake

21:16.834 --> 21:18.667
of going downstairs
and having that Yemenite food

21:18.667 --> 21:20.625
that you said looked dodgy.
No, you didn't.

21:20.625 --> 21:23.291
I had food poisoning
for what, like, two days?
Two days, yeah.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.708
Fuck! I hoped you
stiffed them on the tip.

21:25.708 --> 21:29.333
(both laugh)
In Boulder,
we go out to the movies,

21:29.333 --> 21:32.083
and then afterwards,
we go out to, like, a pot club.

21:32.083 --> 21:37.041
You just fill a pint glass
with weed smoke,
and you do it like a beer. What?

21:37.041 --> 21:40.125
Amazing.
That's un-fucking-believable.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.625
(laughing)

21:41.625 --> 21:44.667
Colin: Totally.
Gigi: Thank God.
At least that.

21:44.667 --> 21:46.875
(laughs) I am gonna
stiff you on that tip.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.875
Do not want
to present that one...
(doorbell buzzes)

21:49.875 --> 21:53.542
Who's that, honey?
Gigi: I think that's
the belly dancer.

21:53.542 --> 21:56.792
You got a dancer?
You're too much, Gigi.

21:56.792 --> 22:00.542
You should see the cake!
That photo! Oh, my God,
it's hysterical.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.875
How do you come up
with this stuff?
She's a producer.

22:02.875 --> 22:04.500
That's what she-- Holy shit.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.875
You sure it's not the weed guy
taking us up on your invitation?

22:06.875 --> 22:09.542
Wait, you guys invited him?
Oh, I think he's so sexy.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.375
Please tell me I'm not
the only one who thinks that?

22:11.375 --> 22:12.875
He totally looks
like a young John Malkovich.

I'm just gonna say it.

24:36.375 --> 24:40.458
Uh, I just tested positive
for chlamydia,

24:40.458 --> 24:43.125

you should all get tested,

24:56.291 --> 25:00.041
and, you know,
suffice it to say, we probably
shouldn't play tonight.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.750
What?
This is-- This is fucked up!

25:02.750 --> 25:04.333
Man:
It doesn't make any sense!

you get tested earlier?

they were, they seemed--

25:11.250 --> 25:12.792
Are you trying to trick me
into a threesome?

they have chlamydia?

You can't just leave!

Yes, I can!

Sorry, excuse me.
Do you mind

stuff we can do, right?

Got my new tassels!

Deb, we didn't haul
our asses to Brooklyn
for some dry humping

25:43.166 --> 25:46.125
and some fucking
stale pita chips.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.500
Fuck you guys.
Deb: Mike!

25:47.500 --> 25:50.125
Were you just planning
on not telling us?

25:50.125 --> 25:53.333
Honestly, you know,
I thought if we all
already had it

25:53.333 --> 25:57.125
that we could play, you know,
and then we could tomorrow

25:57.125 --> 25:59.667

and get better together.

25:59.667 --> 26:02.792
Wow.
Get better together?
Are you fucking serious, Leo?

Hey, that is so irresponsible.
And that's not how it works,
you idiot.

26:06.375 --> 26:08.458
Oh, come on. Relax.
You know, listen.

26:08.458 --> 26:10.333
There is some logic
to what he's saying. I mean--

26:10.333 --> 26:12.375
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't get carried away,

26:12.375 --> 26:14.125
but there is
some sense to it.

26:14.125 --> 26:17.834
Okay. You know what?
Maybe we're just
the first to realize it.

26:17.834 --> 26:21.291
But how... how do you
all know that we didn't get it
from you guys?

26:21.291 --> 26:23.625
Oh, I can tell you why.
You know why?
No, no.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.708

we follow the rules.

26:25.708 --> 26:27.542

26:30.083 --> 26:32.000
All right, if we're
fucking being honest here.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.417
When... before Steve
and I split up,

26:34.417 --> 26:36.834
and we said we were going
to put his mother
in a home in Madison,

26:36.834 --> 26:39.333
we actually went to Vieques
and we played
with another group.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.041
Renee!
Wow.

26:41.041 --> 26:44.542
I knew it! You were too tan!
You were too tan for winter!

26:44.542 --> 26:46.667
I know! I fucking
just had to say it.

26:46.667 --> 26:49.583
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You knew?
I had to tell someone.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.291
I pride myself on being
a very discrete person. Okay?

26:52.291 --> 26:55.041
If... if a friend asks me
to keep a secret,

26:55.041 --> 26:57.417
I have to honor that!
Wait, that is fucked up!

26:57.417 --> 26:59.000
You see this?
How is that fucked up?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.333
Come on!
Look, we were trying
to save our marriage

27:01.333 --> 27:03.458
and, you know,
we used protection,

27:03.458 --> 27:05.500
for the most part,
we were pretty drunk.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.750
I feel like,
you know, I'm feeling
really shitty about it.

27:07.750 --> 27:10.417
It just proves that
no one is perfect.

27:10.417 --> 27:14.208
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.
Who the fuck are you all? Huh?

27:14.208 --> 27:16.083
Oh, it's chlamydia.
I don't even know you anymore.

27:16.083 --> 27:20.458
You take a Z-Pak,
you're fine.
I feel-- I feel so betrayed.

27:20.458 --> 27:24.500
It's like a fucking opera.
No! I'm sorry, Deb. It's true.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.667
I bought you a cock ring
for your birthday, motherfucker.

27:26.667 --> 27:31.166
Happy birthday.
Hey, look. Maybe this
is just a wake-up call,

27:31.166 --> 27:34.625
and we just need
to set new boundaries, okay?

27:34.625 --> 27:36.917
Is that why you invited
Victor/Victoria to our party?

27:36.917 --> 27:40.125
Woman: Whoa.
Don't call him that!

27:40.125 --> 27:41.708
Deb: It's not nice!
He's wearing a dress.

27:41.708 --> 27:43.583
No one's actually
fucking out there.

27:43.583 --> 27:45.083
No, but it sounds
like they're about to.

27:45.083 --> 27:48.417
Colin? Becky?
Can I get your Wi-Fi?

27:48.417 --> 27:50.000
Sorry.
We'll just be one sec.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.583
Woman: I thought
people liked tapping.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.583
Tapping would be great.
Slapping is a little excessive.
It's a little harsh, right?

27:55.583 --> 27:59.125
You know, it's just
a sensitive body part.
I don't do that!

27:59.125 --> 28:00.708
You do do it. You do.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.834
(knock on door)
There's our tight-ass
fucking neighbor

28:02.834 --> 28:04.417
right on fucking schedule.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.875
Guys, please keep
your voices down.

28:06.875 --> 28:12.250
I thought we were
going to a fucking party,
not an asshat convention.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.500
I need to talk
to your husband!
It's not a good time.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.458
We're entertaining right now.
No, no!

28:16.458 --> 28:19.041
Listen!
The music is not even on!

28:19.041 --> 28:22.000
Not about the music!
You people bring drugs
into the building!

28:22.000 --> 28:26.166
What? What are
you talking about?
I show you now.

28:26.166 --> 28:28.250
Here. This. This.

28:28.250 --> 28:30.792
Sorry, thanks
for the great party.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.667
Sitter emergency.
Sorry. Hi.

28:35.333 --> 28:37.166
(stammers)

28:37.166 --> 28:40.792
(laughs) This is pot!
This isn't drugs.
