with my life.

Fine. Go.

I was in prison
for a long-ass time, you know,

10:43.227 --> 10:46.647

in that block of ice for a long-ass time.

When we both got out,
we didn't know how to act anymore.

10:50.234 --> 10:53.362

You know, just like
the California prison system took my mojo.

get all my mojo back.

that movie was a comedy.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.124
you'd be lost.

throw that in my face.

it technically wasn't a session,

12:03.432 --> 12:05.350
so it's actually public information now.

Well, maybe the only way

12:41.053 --> 12:42.721
you could help all of us out

12:42.721 --> 12:45.140
is if you help yourself out first, homey.

'Cause Sandy says you and I
should go to therapy together, Julio.

for me to make real progress.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.107

13:35.691 --> 13:37.860
Luis tells me that as the older cousin,

13:37.860 --> 13:40.445
he would bully you and make fun of you.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.906
How do you feel about that?

you know, he tries to
check me a lot as a grown-up

13:58.297 --> 14:00.424
and I believe it's some form of revenge

14:00.424 --> 14:03.510
for all the times that
I legitimately checked him as a kid.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.096

14:06.096 --> 14:08.098
and there's certain shit
I'm responsible for,

14:08.807 --> 14:10.893

But I'm trying to understand
Julio's need to check.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.071

needs to be checked sometimes.
