01:03.334 --> 01:05.584
Drug abuse is a plague.

01:06.042 --> 01:09.376
It spreads across our nation,
harming our citizens.

01:14.626 --> 01:17.417
Drugs are synonymous with the Golden Triangle.

01:17.542 --> 01:21.751
Situated at the borders of Thailand,
Myanmar and Laos,

01:22.001 --> 01:24.709
this "No Man's Land" has long been safe heaven
for criminals and drug dealers.

01:25.626 --> 01:29.126
The emergence of new drugs
has lowered the threshold of production

01:29.584 --> 01:32.667
and solidified the reputation
of the Golden Triangle as a drug empire.

01:34.917 --> 01:38.084
At 4,180 km, the Mekong River

01:38.751 --> 01:41.334
is an important link between our nation
and Southeast Asia.

01:41.584 --> 01:44.876
It's also the ideal route for drugs
to enter our nation from the Golden Triangle.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.334
It is known as the "Hell's Gate of the South."

02:41.667 --> 02:44.501
Dad, this is the "Hell's Gate"?

02:57.959 --> 03:00.126
Why is it called "Hell's Gate"?

03:00.334 --> 03:02.292
Pirates have plagued this strip
of the river for years.

03:02.417 --> 03:04.376
Let's hope luck is on our side this time.

03:13.209 --> 03:14.709
Turn around! Notify Huangping!

03:16.751 --> 03:18.501
Huangping, Huangping, do you read me?

03:27.209 --> 03:28.959
Listen up, there are two hostages in the vehicle.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.126
Thunder, Black Cat, lock on the hijackers.

03:32.959 --> 03:35.167
This is Thunder,
I've locked on to the target in blue.

03:35.959 --> 03:38.001
This is Black Cat,
I've locked on to the target in gray.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.876
Teams two and three, prepare for attack!

04:09.376 --> 04:11.042
Our next demonstration is tactical shooting.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.209
First, the eastern regional team

04:13.251 --> 04:14.917
will demonstrate the dual shot.

04:15.042 --> 04:18.459
Here, two snipers will aim
for the same mark at the same time...

04:19.209 --> 04:22.917
Minister, we have a situation on the Mekong River.

04:24.792 --> 04:27.417
Thanks to our newly appointed

04:27.459 --> 04:30.376
7th Army Region Deputy Commander General Bita,

04:31.001 --> 04:35.126
this large-scale multi-national drug trade

04:35.167 --> 04:37.501
was taken down in time.

04:40.459 --> 04:43.459
Upon receiving reliable information,

04:43.584 --> 04:48.334
we intercepted two Chinese cargo ships
on the Mekong River.

04:48.751 --> 04:53.334
In the process, we exchanged fire
with over ten Chinese fishermen.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.876
The fishermen fled the scene,

04:56.167 --> 04:59.042
but we were able to uncover
900,000 meth pills on board.

05:02.334 --> 05:02.959
Minister,

05:03.709 --> 05:06.417
we are in contact with the Thai police,

05:06.709 --> 05:08.584
but the Thai military

05:08.626 --> 05:10.751
is holding all the evidence.

05:10.876 --> 05:12.251
The Thai police can't interfere.

05:12.417 --> 05:14.459
They can't even begin their investigation

05:14.542 --> 05:16.167
until the military completes theirs.

05:16.292 --> 05:19.959
We don't know how long we'll have to wait.

05:20.834 --> 05:23.167
Who do you have in mind for the task force?

05:23.709 --> 05:25.501
I'm thinking Gao Gang.

05:26.709 --> 05:30.209
The captain of the Yunnan Narcotics Team?

05:30.709 --> 05:31.709
That's right.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.834
I hear he's a stubborn one.

05:35.542 --> 05:36.084
Minister,

05:36.584 --> 05:40.292
we need his stubbornness to break this case.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.334
So you've already been in touch with him?

05:44.126 --> 05:45.251
Yes.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.376
Minister Hao,

05:52.251 --> 05:53.167
has given his approval.

05:55.251 --> 05:58.417
When I told him that you'd lead the investigation,

05:58.667 --> 06:00.751
he glared hard at me.

06:01.292 --> 06:05.251
I really thought that he would turn me down.

06:06.084 --> 06:08.376
Pass me a cigarette.

06:09.084 --> 06:09.917
Come on.

06:10.292 --> 06:12.959
Your doctor ordered you to quit. Take this.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.251
Quitting is tough.

06:28.876 --> 06:29.709
Gao,

06:31.501 --> 06:32.751
I only have one condition.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.792
Play this by the book.

06:34.917 --> 06:37.209
You got it!

06:37.584 --> 06:38.251
One more thing.

06:39.959 --> 06:42.292
Don't ever smoke in front of me.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.167
Dead body!

07:28.001 --> 07:29.709
This is just too cruel!

07:30.001 --> 07:32.251
It's clearly murder!

07:32.292 --> 07:33.417
They've been blindfolded with their hands tied!

07:33.542 --> 07:34.667
Hello, viewers.

07:35.001 --> 07:39.251
We return to the pier now

07:39.334 --> 07:41.084
for the latest developments.

07:41.126 --> 07:43.751
The Thai military confirms that the 13 victims

07:43.792 --> 07:46.167
were indeed crew members...

07:46.376 --> 07:47.042
Yes?

07:52.209 --> 07:53.959
I'm sorry, Boss.

07:54.584 --> 07:56.376
I didn't do a good job.

07:57.292 --> 07:58.626
I'll take care of it.

07:59.084 --> 08:02.501
The Thai reports say that
the military exchanged fire with the fishermen.

08:03.209 --> 08:05.042
But judging by Mekong River's flow
of stream that day,

08:05.376 --> 08:07.584
if there really was a shootout,

08:08.084 --> 08:10.251
and if the two cargo ships
really were smuggling drugs,

08:10.584 --> 08:12.834
they should've been firing

08:13.084 --> 08:14.334
and speeding away at the same time.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.459
But at the crime scene,

08:16.834 --> 08:20.584
the bullet hole distribution and
trajectories clustered around the same spot.

08:20.626 --> 08:25.876
We can confirm that the bullets
were fired in a stationary position.

08:26.251 --> 08:29.376
This conclusion overturns the Thai reports.

08:31.667 --> 08:32.917
There's something even more evident.

08:32.958 --> 08:35.042
We've found a number of possible bullet scratches

08:35.501 --> 08:37.626
on a metal panel on one of the ships.

08:37.876 --> 08:40.417
Judging by their degree and concentration,

08:40.751 --> 08:43.917
the shots could not have come from the shore.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.751
They were fired on the ship instead.

08:46.626 --> 08:49.834
Combine that with the bullet angle analysis
on the victims,

08:50.084 --> 08:53.626
we can confirm it was a
45-degree point blank execution.

08:55.417 --> 08:56.917
Any updates from your intel networks?

08:57.126 --> 08:58.834
Our Golden Triangle intelligence officer Qifu

08:58.876 --> 09:00.084
just got a lead.

09:00.459 --> 09:02.209
Two weeks before the shooting,

09:02.501 --> 09:04.876
a drug deal was ambushed.

09:04.917 --> 09:08.542
The amount of meth pills stolen
also happened to be 900,000.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.376
Did we find anyone involved in the theft?

09:10.792 --> 09:11.626
We did.

09:14.084 --> 09:17.042
One of Qifu's informants is tracking him.

10:28.751 --> 10:29.501
Stop!

10:29.542 --> 10:30.709
Move!

10:39.459 --> 10:40.376
Get in!

11:20.751 --> 11:21.792
They're armed!

11:22.084 --> 11:23.376
Don't move!

11:57.501 --> 11:59.334
I'm asking you one last time.

12:05.917 --> 12:10.292
Who hired you to steal those 900,000 meth pills?

12:24.042 --> 12:27.042
What the fuck are you doing?

12:28.876 --> 12:30.334
You're about to die.

12:42.667 --> 12:43.834
It's Yan Taung Pha!

12:44.167 --> 12:46.417
Yan Taung Pha hired me!

12:47.001 --> 12:52.001
He told me to put the meth pills on the two ships!

12:53.167 --> 12:55.792
Yan Taung Pha from Naw Khan's group?

12:56.501 --> 12:58.626
That's all I know, I swear...

12:59.042 --> 13:01.417
Save me, Save me...

13:09.626 --> 13:12.167
Who the hell is this drug lord Naw Khar?

13:12.334 --> 13:14.126
Naw Khar has a rather complicated history.

13:14.417 --> 13:15.792
He's originally from Myanmar,

13:16.334 --> 13:18.542
but he's also a citizen of Thailand and Laos.

13:19.292 --> 13:23.209
In the 80s, he worked for Khun Sa,
the drug kingpin of the Golden Triangle.

13:23.542 --> 13:26.376
When Khun Sa
surrendered to the Burmese government,

13:26.584 --> 13:28.751
Naw Khar absorbed most of Khun Sa's men

13:28.792 --> 13:32.126
and built a new force with them
and the local militia.

13:33.126 --> 13:35.917
Khun Sa and Naw Khar
have completely different styles.

13:36.376 --> 13:39.876
Naw Khar is a reckless and arrogant drug addict.

13:40.292 --> 13:43.584
Most of his men use drugs as well.

13:45.126 --> 13:47.417
He oppresses the small tribes.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.376
He turns the kids into child soldiers

13:51.209 --> 13:53.626
and controls them with drugs.

13:54.251 --> 13:57.667
Many local tribes are forced to work
with his group.

13:58.042 --> 14:00.126
We've always wanted to work with Laos,
Burma and Thailand

14:00.251 --> 14:02.376
to improve security along the Mekong River,

14:03.792 --> 14:06.001
but an agreement was never reached.

14:08.626 --> 14:12.501
This case involves
so much bloodshed and brutality.

14:14.751 --> 14:16.376
This is the perfect time

14:16.542 --> 14:19.167
for us to call for joint patrols again.

14:19.917 --> 14:21.959
We have to clear our fishermen's names.

14:22.459 --> 14:24.501
We owe the nation an explanation!

14:26.751 --> 14:28.084
The purpose of this joint meeting

14:28.626 --> 14:30.542
is to break past geographical boundaries.

14:30.876 --> 14:33.584
Let Chinese officers investigate
in the three nations

14:33.917 --> 14:35.876
for the capture of our common target.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.126
Gentlemen,

14:37.292 --> 14:40.584
we have secured a witness
from Thailand named Wala.

14:41.584 --> 14:43.126
He has already confessed that

14:43.876 --> 14:45.709
this frameup was orchestrated

14:46.001 --> 14:48.501
by Golden Triangle drug lord Naw Khar.

14:49.876 --> 14:52.834
To get to the truth, we must apprehend Naw Khar.

14:52.959 --> 14:53.751
Salute!

14:57.376 --> 14:59.042
We must send a strong message

14:59.126 --> 15:00.542
to the criminals in the Golden Triangle.

15:01.126 --> 15:03.376
When our citizens are under threat,

15:03.876 --> 15:05.792
We will not stand idly by.

15:06.459 --> 15:10.167
We fight aggression with aggression.
Our elite narcotics officers

15:10.626 --> 15:13.626
will make Mekong River a safe passage
for everyone!

15:15.667 --> 15:17.876
The four nations jointly announce

15:18.292 --> 15:20.459
the establishment of the
joint operation task force.

15:21.459 --> 15:24.792
Together, we will solve the "October 5" case
with great urgency.

15:25.459 --> 15:30.542
We will capture the culprit
who murdered 13 Chinese fishermen!

15:36.001 --> 15:38.667
This is our first joint operation.

15:39.084 --> 15:41.917
Our goal is to subdue Naw Khar's group.

15:42.959 --> 15:45.251
With the help of reliable sources,

15:45.334 --> 15:47.417
we managed to locate Naw Khar's various

15:47.501 --> 15:49.667
drug factories and trafficking spots.

15:50.167 --> 15:54.667
We must hit them on the blind side,
and we have to make our move at once!

15:55.334 --> 15:58.334
The joint task force commander
has given us authorization

15:58.584 --> 16:01.459
to use force under special circumstances.

16:01.501 --> 16:03.251
If there's an urgent situation,

16:03.334 --> 16:04.709
we must provide full support!

16:04.876 --> 16:05.792
Understood!

17:10.291 --> 17:14.916
China is making the other three nations
take action.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.501
You should all lay low until the dust settles.

17:19.334 --> 17:20.834
This is our turf!

17:21.166 --> 17:24.501
Laos, Burma and Thailand never got us,

17:24.791 --> 17:26.791
so why the fuck should we fear China?

17:27.541 --> 17:29.459
Boss is furious.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.042
He demands you to explain

17:31.084 --> 17:32.751
how things got this far.

17:36.376 --> 17:39.126
I've done everything he's asked for.

17:39.709 --> 17:42.292
How I did it is none of his business.

17:44.626 --> 17:46.917
If he really wants an explanation...

17:53.459 --> 17:55.376
There's your explanation, P'Som!

17:55.959 --> 17:59.542
I'm Naw Khar, I'm not afraid of anything!

18:04.167 --> 18:04.959
Gao,

18:05.667 --> 18:07.876
Naw Khar is wanted for many crimes
in the other three nations.

18:08.042 --> 18:10.209
We can't let him fall into
the hands of the other nations,

18:10.501 --> 18:12.584
so we have to be the first to get him.

18:12.959 --> 18:16.084
Qifu has already obtained intel
on Naw Khar's group.

18:27.292 --> 18:27.917
Gao Gang.

18:28.042 --> 18:29.001
Fang Xinwu.

18:29.251 --> 18:30.792
We finally meet in person

18:31.126 --> 18:32.667
after getting your intel for so many years.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.084
Nice to finally meet you too.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.167
Quite a huge farm you've got here.

18:50.709 --> 18:52.417
The hills that you see in front of you

18:53.834 --> 18:55.001
were all opium farms.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.001
Looks like alternative development
changed everything.

18:58.792 --> 18:59.626
That's good.

19:00.167 --> 19:01.292
The problem is...

19:02.001 --> 19:04.084
it hasn't changed the nature
of the Golden Triangle.

19:05.751 --> 19:09.376
These are residents of villages nearby.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.917
Drug dealers forced them to plant opium.

19:14.001 --> 19:16.626
When they refused, their limbs were chopped off.

19:22.959 --> 19:23.709
Morning!

19:24.167 --> 19:25.501
Good morning, Mr. Qifu.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.834
Don't forget our movie screening tonight.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.584
7 o'clock. See you there, Mr. Qifu.

19:37.917 --> 19:38.834
Our intel tell us that

19:39.126 --> 19:40.626
Naw Khar and his backbone members

19:40.667 --> 19:42.292
have left their strongholds.

19:46.084 --> 19:48.584
Ongsa, operations commander.

19:48.917 --> 19:51.251
A bodyguard who also handles
kidnapping and looting.

19:52.334 --> 19:54.584
Ya Ta, business and trading.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.751
San Kyi, logistics and money laundering.

19:59.209 --> 20:01.876
These three men are
the backbone members of Naw Khar's group.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.542
Naw Khar arranges their duties himself.

20:06.251 --> 20:07.251
Who is Nah Htuu?

20:07.834 --> 20:08.917
Naw Khar's eldest son.

20:11.042 --> 20:13.376
Why is Naw Khar's picture so blurry?

20:13.626 --> 20:15.959
That photo was taken
ten years ago by the Interpol.

20:16.417 --> 20:17.542
It also happens to be the one and only.

20:17.626 --> 20:18.626
How could that be?

20:19.084 --> 20:20.626
He's been active for the past decade.

20:20.667 --> 20:22.626
Why isn't there more on him?

20:23.959 --> 20:26.209
Naw Khar always acts under the radar.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.792
He's hiding out in the mountains
of the Golden Triangle Special Region.

20:30.626 --> 20:36.584
It sits at the intersecting point of Thailand,
Laos and Myanmar.

20:37.084 --> 20:38.751
It's under the three countries' jurisdiction,

20:39.626 --> 20:41.626
but its location makes law enforcement
almost impossible.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.584
Adding corruption into the equation,

20:46.126 --> 20:48.959
the region is a "No Man's Land",
a paradise for criminals.

20:49.626 --> 20:52.376
This is where Puja is
holding Naw Khar's man Yan Taung Pha.

20:55.126 --> 20:56.417
If we can extract Yan Taung Pha,

20:56.792 --> 20:58.167
it should get us some leads.

20:59.042 --> 21:00.334
Who is this Puja?

21:02.001 --> 21:03.584
One of the five kingpins in the Special Region,

21:03.792 --> 21:06.167
He's the most powerful one after Naw Khar.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.084
What's your plan?

21:08.334 --> 21:09.667
I've already planted a mole.

21:11.501 --> 21:12.792
But remember,

21:13.376 --> 21:14.667
whatever happens,

21:15.459 --> 21:17.376
you have only 15 minutes to complete the mission.

21:18.334 --> 21:19.667
This is a complicated case.

21:19.834 --> 21:21.251
There's a larger power working behind the scenes.

21:21.834 --> 21:24.376
We must be careful and stay out
of the local police's sights.

21:24.709 --> 21:26.376
If anything happens,

21:26.626 --> 21:28.751
keep your identities secret.

21:29.751 --> 21:31.709
There's only one entry way
for the entire district.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.042
A metal detector has been installed there.

21:36.334 --> 21:38.209
That means no one can carry guns inside.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.376
It's how they keep trouble away.

21:41.959 --> 21:43.542
The chance of a gunfight is minimal,

21:44.126 --> 21:46.876
but these guys are brutal with their axes.

21:47.501 --> 21:48.584
Every day at noon,

21:48.626 --> 21:50.542
a beer truck arrives for delivery.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.667
The whole process takes about 15 minutes.

21:54.209 --> 21:57.209
The plan is to use the beer truck
to extract Yan Tuang Pha.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.417
Panoptes, monitor the surroundings
with your drone.

22:00.834 --> 22:01.542
If anything happens,

22:01.584 --> 22:03.042
I'll ask you to activate the signal jammer.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.542
Aphrodite, take Bingo with you.

22:07.709 --> 22:09.667
The others will follow the Bulls as backup.

22:10.376 --> 22:13.042
All guns will be loaded
with low-speed rubber bullets.

22:13.709 --> 22:14.542
Our mission

22:14.626 --> 22:16.292
is to extract Yan Taung Pha

22:16.334 --> 22:17.667
without causing any casualty.

22:20.501 --> 22:22.417
Everyone is in position, Chief.

22:37.042 --> 22:38.251
Captain, the truck is here.

23:19.834 --> 23:22.084
We have a situation, target is missing.

23:26.792 --> 23:27.626
Gongchai,

23:27.751 --> 23:30.126
the target is missing. Where else he can be?

23:30.376 --> 23:31.834
He was right there earlier...

23:32.459 --> 23:34.542
The informant didn't see anyone
move Yan Taung Pha.

23:36.334 --> 23:37.876
Aphrodite, let Bingo in.

23:37.959 --> 23:38.626
Copy!

23:48.959 --> 23:49.959
Bingo is in.

23:57.834 --> 23:58.667
Poseidon,

23:59.084 --> 24:00.167
let's stick to the plan.

24:00.292 --> 24:01.042
Copy that.

24:11.834 --> 24:12.834
Bingo.

24:14.292 --> 24:15.876
Bingo, sniff.

24:19.834 --> 24:20.501
Go!

24:35.334 --> 24:37.376
Remember, our target is Puja.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.209
What about Yan Taung Pha?

24:39.542 --> 24:40.667
Just fucking kill him.

24:40.709 --> 24:42.542
He's embarrassed our boss.

25:22.626 --> 25:24.751
Listen up. The target's life is in danger.

25:25.626 --> 25:26.751
I'm gonna snatch him!

25:26.792 --> 25:28.417
Panoptes, jam their signal now!

25:28.542 --> 25:29.126
Copy!

25:34.001 --> 25:36.584
- Can you hear me?
- Do you copy?

25:56.376 --> 25:57.126
Go!

26:24.959 --> 26:26.292
Let's go back Captain up!

26:57.001 --> 26:57.667
We're exposed.

26:57.834 --> 26:59.542
Panotpes, any other way out?

27:03.542 --> 27:05.834
Take the rooftop. There's a cable there,

27:06.542 --> 27:07.876
it's connected to another rooftop.

27:11.626 --> 27:12.292
Bingo,

27:13.084 --> 27:13.834
retreat!

27:23.501 --> 27:24.709
There's trouble in there!

27:25.084 --> 27:26.542
Lock the gate!

27:28.209 --> 27:29.542
Get over here!

27:31.876 --> 27:33.417
Go! Go!

27:46.501 --> 27:47.167
Aphrodite,

27:47.376 --> 27:49.667
pick up Captain. Turn left in 200m!

27:49.876 --> 27:50.542
Copy!

27:56.667 --> 27:57.667
You guys stay right here.

28:11.542 --> 28:12.334
Go help Captain!

28:12.376 --> 28:13.084
Okay!

28:23.417 --> 28:24.751
See if we can use that net!

28:27.084 --> 28:27.959
Captain, you go ahead!

28:58.167 --> 28:59.876
We're out of time! Go!

29:06.959 --> 29:09.209
Captain, there's a hut at your 12 o'clock.

29:09.292 --> 29:11.334
Jump down to the alleyway.
Turn left at the end for the exit.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.709
At 300 meters,
take a left after the blue metal gates.

29:15.792 --> 29:17.459
Then take the small path
at the 2 o'clock direction.

29:32.917 --> 29:33.834
Hurry up!

29:38.917 --> 29:41.084
Bulls, we're on our way out.
Request for assistance!

29:41.334 --> 29:42.626
Chief, we have an urgent situation.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.334
Permission for the Bulls to strike!

29:44.501 --> 29:45.167
Granted.

30:21.917 --> 30:22.751
Blow it!

30:25.626 --> 30:26.792
Fuck!

30:45.417 --> 30:46.834
Captain! Hurry!

30:47.126 --> 30:47.709
Hurry!

30:47.917 --> 30:49.084
Chinese?

30:49.376 --> 30:51.959
Move it!

30:59.417 --> 31:01.917
(Burmese) Who are you people?

31:02.709 --> 31:04.751
Why did you save me?

32:01.917 --> 32:02.542
Ammo!

32:16.167 --> 32:16.959
Hermes!

32:17.626 --> 32:19.001
We have enemies in pursuit!

32:19.167 --> 32:20.501
We're right behind you, Captain!

33:09.626 --> 33:10.709
Aphrodite, are you okay?

33:10.959 --> 33:11.751
I'm fine!

33:25.042 --> 33:25.876
Fuck!

33:26.834 --> 33:27.834
Fucking hell!

33:29.209 --> 33:30.709
This is the Golden Triangle, Captain!

33:30.751 --> 33:32.251
So what if this is the Golden Triangle?!

33:32.292 --> 33:33.709
My informant is exposed!

33:34.709 --> 33:35.584
Didn't we have an agreement?

33:35.751 --> 33:38.042
15 minutes means 15 minutes!

33:38.626 --> 33:39.834
You were to fucking retreat,

33:39.876 --> 33:41.292
no matter what!

33:42.251 --> 33:43.876
Out here, you have to do things my way!

33:45.084 --> 33:46.167
Are you finished?

33:46.584 --> 33:48.459
We had one chance to save Yan Taung Pha.

33:48.709 --> 33:49.584
I had to take it!

33:49.917 --> 33:51.876
If we had failed, we could've found other leads!

33:52.251 --> 33:53.751
You're fucking responsible for intel.

33:54.001 --> 33:55.751
I make the fucking calls!

33:56.417 --> 33:58.251
If we're going to keep working together,

33:58.584 --> 34:00.084
you have to follow my lead!

34:09.458 --> 34:11.376
Forget it. Take my car.

34:15.958 --> 34:17.126
Make a left at the corner ahead.

34:17.292 --> 34:18.251
Which one?

34:20.083 --> 34:21.126
You just passed it.

34:23.042 --> 34:24.292
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

34:33.126 --> 34:33.751
What's wrong?

34:33.792 --> 34:36.292
Puja is hot on my trail. I need to leave now.

34:36.501 --> 34:38.501
Don't panic...

34:39.626 --> 34:43.458
Get to the train station.
I'll bring some cash. Okay?

34:46.792 --> 34:47.958
Gongchai's on the run.

34:48.792 --> 34:49.876
Wait for me in the car.

34:50.333 --> 34:51.792
Call me if anything happens.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.501
Call me if you need anything.

35:31.917 --> 35:33.042
What's the matter?

35:34.501 --> 35:35.709
I'm sorry, Qifu...

35:36.667 --> 35:38.209
I didn't want it to be like this!

35:38.584 --> 35:40.251
They got to me first...

35:41.084 --> 35:42.501
you have to help me!

36:03.334 --> 36:04.376
Where did they go?

36:07.501 --> 36:09.334
What's your location? I'm coming over.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.876
Don't! I'm exposed.

36:11.334 --> 36:13.917
I'm behind the snack shop
at the far end of the platform.

36:14.917 --> 36:16.584
Gongchai will be where I dash out.

36:16.917 --> 36:17.917
Help me protect him.

36:18.334 --> 36:19.251
I'll handle the rest.

36:19.709 --> 36:20.667
Search again!

36:21.917 --> 36:22.584
Over there!

37:16.626 --> 37:17.501
Piss off!

37:46.834 --> 37:48.126
Let me go!

38:30.709 --> 38:31.834
I have to say...

38:32.376 --> 38:34.084
I'm not used to seeing that look.

38:35.042 --> 38:36.792
You should keep your disguise on!

38:37.709 --> 38:40.209
Well, you don't look too bad yourself.

38:46.459 --> 38:48.292
Icarus, pass me a plate.

38:48.334 --> 38:48.959
Sure.

38:49.042 --> 38:50.084
Watch out, don't burn yourself.

39:07.084 --> 39:07.709
I think...

39:08.584 --> 39:10.584
You really remind me of somebody.

39:11.917 --> 39:12.584
Yep!

39:13.501 --> 39:14.292
Who is that?

39:14.792 --> 39:16.084
Many people said so!

39:17.501 --> 39:18.584
But I can't tell who...

39:20.167 --> 39:20.834
Watch!

39:35.042 --> 39:35.834
Aaron Kwok!

39:36.709 --> 39:37.626
Aaron Kwok...

39:38.917 --> 39:39.834
Aaron Kwok.

39:41.792 --> 39:44.501
I'm starting to doubt your intel.

39:44.667 --> 39:45.459
Time to eat!

39:46.042 --> 39:47.167
Let's introduce ourselves!

39:47.209 --> 39:48.292
My name is Guo Xu!

39:48.917 --> 39:51.751
Just call him Poseidon. He's always moody.

39:52.126 --> 39:53.251
I'm his sister, Guo Bing!

39:54.417 --> 39:58.084
Never call her by her code name.
She'll be really pissed.

39:58.417 --> 39:59.209
Fill it up!

40:00.042 --> 40:00.792
Why?

40:01.334 --> 40:02.584
People make fun of her all the time.

40:03.292 --> 40:03.834
Don't say it!

40:03.876 --> 40:05.126
The reason is...

40:05.542 --> 40:07.251
Her code name is Aphrodite,

40:07.334 --> 40:08.126
but she looks nothing like a Greek Goddess!

40:08.167 --> 40:09.501
No more beer for you tonight.

40:10.209 --> 40:11.042
How do you do?

40:11.084 --> 40:13.542
Glad to meet you. I'm the translator.

40:13.917 --> 40:14.917
Call me Hermes!

40:15.417 --> 40:16.459
You're up.

40:16.792 --> 40:18.542
I'm Jiang Xing...

40:18.834 --> 40:22.042
I specialize in ex... ex... explosives.

40:22.876 --> 40:24.417
That's why he doesn't like to talk.

40:25.417 --> 40:28.292
He's sharp like a spear.
That's why we gave him the name Ares.

40:28.334 --> 40:32.292
When he's in action,
his commands are always dead-on.

40:32.584 --> 40:35.209
Not even food can shut your mouth, brother.

40:35.417 --> 40:37.542
Xie Wenfeng. They call me Icarus.

40:38.209 --> 40:39.959
He's always acting against his father's wishes.

40:41.334 --> 40:42.001
Fu Baowei.

40:43.792 --> 40:44.501
Call me Panoptes!

40:45.792 --> 40:46.626
One hundred eyes?

40:47.001 --> 40:48.167
I specialize in drones!

40:52.834 --> 40:54.001
He's Bingo.

40:58.084 --> 40:59.709
A team of Greek deities.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.292
I'm impressed.

41:03.834 --> 41:05.001
What about his code name?

41:05.209 --> 41:06.584
Come on. Let's do a toast!

41:06.876 --> 41:08.126
The one and only...

41:08.376 --> 41:09.001
Zeus.

41:09.042 --> 41:09.709
Cheers!

41:09.751 --> 41:10.542
Come on!

41:10.834 --> 41:11.959
Bottoms up!

41:14.376 --> 41:16.792
During our background check on Yan Taung Pha,

41:17.209 --> 41:18.584
we picked up a new lead.

41:19.542 --> 41:23.001
We found out that he has been producing meth

41:23.876 --> 41:26.417
with raw ingredients bought via a middleman.

41:27.334 --> 41:28.501
Ephedra?

41:28.876 --> 41:30.751
It's medicinal ephedra.

41:32.042 --> 41:33.459
Do we have the supplier?

41:34.209 --> 41:35.292
His name is Zhang Da-An.

41:35.584 --> 41:37.209
He's a Chinese medicine merchant from China.

41:37.542 --> 41:40.417
We already have him under our custody in Sichuan.

41:41.001 --> 41:43.292
Did he say who the middleman is?

41:43.376 --> 41:46.376
Naw Khar only has two middlemen
in Golden Triangle.

41:46.751 --> 41:50.917
We don't know who the first person is,
but the other is Mr. Zar.

41:52.084 --> 41:54.334
At the moment, our only lead

41:54.667 --> 41:58.251
is the guy who takes care of Mr. Zar's business,
named Pierre.

41:59.334 --> 42:00.251
I have an idea.

42:01.001 --> 42:03.001
We're going to put on a show.

42:03.459 --> 42:04.751
I'll come up with a role for you.

42:04.834 --> 42:05.417
Sure,

42:06.251 --> 42:08.417
as long as I don't play a ladyboy.

42:09.251 --> 42:10.751
He doesn't look the part anyway.

42:15.584 --> 42:16.251
Yeah?

42:16.376 --> 42:18.834
Hello Pierre, this is Da-An.

42:19.917 --> 42:22.834
Listen, I just ran into some kind of trouble.

42:23.334 --> 42:26.084
The police here are keeping a close eye on me.

42:26.209 --> 42:27.459
What about my stuff?

42:27.959 --> 42:28.876
Don't worry about it.

42:29.792 --> 42:33.501
I have already arranged a new partner
to deliver your stuff.

42:33.542 --> 42:34.626
A new partner?

42:35.126 --> 42:37.667
This is supposed to be our business.
How am I gonna trust him?

42:37.751 --> 42:38.417
Why not?

42:38.709 --> 42:41.626
I trust my partner just like I trust you.

42:42.292 --> 42:45.126
Treat him really well. You're gonna like him.

42:46.001 --> 42:48.792
Alright. Just don't screw up.

42:55.459 --> 42:56.917
Da-An should've introduced us earlier!

42:56.959 --> 42:58.209
We're gonna get on well.

42:58.417 --> 43:00.584
What do you want to do? Sell crap to China?

43:00.751 --> 43:01.792
We'll be rich!

43:02.251 --> 43:04.042
You want to sell crap to China!

43:04.084 --> 43:05.042
That's what I am doing already!

43:05.084 --> 43:07.042
I'm already selling them, man.

43:07.917 --> 43:09.792
Give me the bill!

43:09.834 --> 43:12.376
No! Come on, bring it over! I got it!

43:12.417 --> 43:13.667
You wanna pay the bills?

43:13.709 --> 43:14.459
You be the boss.

43:14.501 --> 43:16.042
I hate paying bills anyway!

43:16.084 --> 43:17.542
Now I be the boss?

43:17.584 --> 43:18.917
You know what we got?

43:18.959 --> 43:21.001
We got that thing...

43:21.292 --> 43:23.459
Too bad we didn't meet earlier.

43:23.501 --> 43:25.626
It's "Xiang Feng Hen Wan."

43:25.667 --> 43:26.667
Whatever.

43:26.917 --> 43:27.417
You're not going anywhere.

43:27.501 --> 43:30.459
You stay with me,
we'll get you some girls, we'll clean you up,

43:30.501 --> 43:32.459
we're gonna have some fun tonight, boy.

43:33.001 --> 43:34.167
Don't fucking lie to me...

43:34.209 --> 43:35.084
Hey!

43:35.334 --> 43:38.167
- What the fuck!
- What the fuck...

43:38.542 --> 43:40.334
Fancy running into you here!

43:40.792 --> 43:42.251
Long time no see, Guo Kun!

43:42.334 --> 43:43.834
What a coincidence!

43:44.751 --> 43:46.167
You're doing pretty well, eh?

43:46.917 --> 43:48.001
What are you doing here?

43:49.001 --> 43:50.167
I was in Myanmar with Mr. Qian

43:50.334 --> 43:52.876
about setting up a casino over there,

43:53.334 --> 43:54.792
so I thought I'd stop by!

43:55.459 --> 43:56.459
Mr. Qian is here too?

43:56.501 --> 43:57.542
Yeah, he's upstairs.

43:59.209 --> 43:59.876
Full house!

44:00.042 --> 44:01.542
What the hell...

44:01.751 --> 44:02.542
Mr. Qian!

44:03.959 --> 44:05.667
Hold on, Xiaoqi. 
I'll be with you in a minute.

44:07.251 --> 44:08.792
Pass? You pass?

44:08.834 --> 44:09.792
Put it out!

44:11.542 --> 44:12.251
No way!

44:12.376 --> 44:12.917
Pass?

44:13.001 --> 44:13.667
No!

44:15.042 --> 44:15.834
Bomb!

44:17.667 --> 44:18.959
Mr. Qian is really something...

44:19.709 --> 44:20.376
Xiaoqi!

44:20.501 --> 44:21.209
Mr. Qian!

44:21.917 --> 44:24.292
How the fuck did you end up in here?

44:24.542 --> 44:28.334
I followed the smell of your money, of course!

44:30.042 --> 44:33.001
I love puppies that are good at sniffing money.

44:34.167 --> 44:35.876
Come, Xiaoqi,

44:36.251 --> 44:37.251
take this.

44:37.417 --> 44:38.501
- Just take it!
- Thanks Mr.Qian.

44:39.042 --> 44:40.542
I won all this today.

44:41.376 --> 44:43.751
I won it all from this rich brat. Just take it!

44:46.792 --> 44:47.417
Thanks, Mr. Qian!

44:47.501 --> 44:48.209
Happy?

44:48.251 --> 44:49.626
Fucking ecstatic! Thanks!

44:49.917 --> 44:50.792
Take a spin.

44:50.917 --> 44:52.667
Wag your tail for me.

44:53.501 --> 44:54.251
Come on!

44:54.751 --> 44:56.251
Of course, Mr. Qian.

45:06.084 --> 45:07.167
Who's this fella?

45:07.417 --> 45:08.584
Pierre, come over here!

45:09.792 --> 45:10.959
This is my good friend Pierre.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.584
He is Mr. Qian.

45:13.917 --> 45:16.376
Nice to meet you, Mr. Qian.

45:16.417 --> 45:17.876
If you wanna do business with the Chinese,

45:17.959 --> 45:20.667
you'll have to learn some Mandarin, won't you?

45:24.584 --> 45:26.959
Mr. Qian, what does he do exactly?

45:27.126 --> 45:28.709
Gambling, man! What do you think?

45:28.751 --> 45:32.042
This guy owns 200 underground casinos in China,

45:32.292 --> 45:34.292
plus God knows how many private banks.

45:34.459 --> 45:37.417
Brother! You, me, and him,
we're gonna work together.

45:37.459 --> 45:40.001
I tell you now. We're gonna work this out.

45:40.459 --> 45:41.709
You don't say!

45:43.084 --> 45:43.792
Listen,

45:45.292 --> 45:47.334
he's already asked me to do some...

45:48.167 --> 45:49.126
You know?

45:52.876 --> 45:53.751
Mr. Pierre.

45:53.792 --> 45:57.167
Xiaoqi, Qian and two bodyguards
have gone to the Princess Club.

45:57.209 --> 46:00.501
Then they'll board a yacht
owned by Macau's Wanhao Casino.

46:02.209 --> 46:03.251
I hear that

46:03.459 --> 46:05.084
Qian is the banker for

46:05.167 --> 46:07.209
four high roller lounges at Wanhao.

46:16.626 --> 46:17.626
Mr. Pierre.

46:17.959 --> 46:20.001
They've brought over 20 girls to the yacht.

46:20.251 --> 46:21.792
I'll have people keep a close eye from the shore.

46:26.292 --> 46:29.834
Trust me! These guys are real deal.

46:31.209 --> 46:31.917
Pierre,

46:32.001 --> 46:33.626
do you know what makes a good steak?

46:35.542 --> 46:39.709
Good quality of meat, the right temperature,
the right cooking time.

46:39.917 --> 46:41.501
How many times have I taught you

46:41.751 --> 46:43.584
to look beneath the surface?

46:43.709 --> 46:44.667
It's all about

46:44.709 --> 46:48.001
how carefully the chef
treats the steak.

46:49.959 --> 46:51.792
Of course, Mr. Zar.

46:54.417 --> 46:56.792
Mr. Zar, your friend has arrived.

47:00.584 --> 47:02.167
Hello, Mr. Zar.

47:05.126 --> 47:06.376
Thank you, Mr. Zar.

47:07.542 --> 47:08.459
Thank you.

47:09.584 --> 47:11.334
I've been gone for five years,

47:11.376 --> 47:12.876
and I have nothing to show for it.

47:13.251 --> 47:16.167
That's why I've come back to the Golden Triangle.

47:16.751 --> 47:19.959
America isn't the easiest place
to make a living in.

47:20.417 --> 47:25.417
There's this Chinese guy
that Pierre came across not long ago.

47:25.751 --> 47:27.792
And he wanted to talk business.

47:28.292 --> 47:32.084
As I'm sure,
you're more familiar with China than me.

47:32.626 --> 47:35.626
Why don't you go and check him out for me?

47:35.876 --> 47:40.084
Doing business with the Chinese is my specialty!

47:40.417 --> 47:42.501
I'll make sure you get a good deal!

48:05.251 --> 48:06.126
Mr. Qian,

48:06.626 --> 48:10.459
this is the golden age for the gambling business.

48:11.459 --> 48:14.334
Everyone in China is so rich nowadays!

48:16.292 --> 48:19.751
Mr. Jitpong,
how much product are you able to supply annually?

48:20.667 --> 48:21.626
Two tons!

48:22.459 --> 48:23.667
We can definitely deal with two tons.

48:24.042 --> 48:26.167
You just said that we're in the golden age!

48:26.792 --> 48:27.792
Two tons?

48:29.251 --> 48:31.584
Two tons were barely enough a few years ago.

48:31.626 --> 48:33.459
We do much bigger deals now.

48:34.084 --> 48:35.667
I'm talking about a minimum of

48:36.292 --> 48:37.959
six tons per year!

48:38.751 --> 48:40.459
Hey, who's that Jitpong guy?

48:41.626 --> 48:45.209
I thought you're the only guy
who's dealing with Mr. Zar's business?

48:45.667 --> 48:48.001
Jitpong is from America.

48:48.334 --> 48:51.834
And Mr. Zar likes him a lot.

48:59.292 --> 49:03.334
Mr. Qian,
we can always talk about commission later.

49:03.709 --> 49:04.751
I'm telling you,

49:04.917 --> 49:06.417
you're not the only middleman in this business.

49:06.501 --> 49:08.501
There are plenty of people I can talk to.

49:09.084 --> 49:11.834
I'm only talking to you
because Xiaoqi can vouch for you,

49:12.251 --> 49:14.167
but you've really disappointed me today.

49:14.542 --> 49:15.667
Yes I am rich,

49:16.084 --> 49:17.667
but I'm not a fucking imbecile!

49:19.501 --> 49:20.501
Got it?

49:24.334 --> 49:25.167
Mr. Qian!

49:28.376 --> 49:29.084
Mr. Qian!

49:32.584 --> 49:34.542
Mr. Qian, we can always negotiate.

49:40.084 --> 49:40.876
Mr. Qian,

49:41.376 --> 49:42.876
we can negotiate for the right price.

49:43.292 --> 49:44.626
We can always talk again.

49:44.834 --> 49:48.584
We're talking about
a 1.5 billion-per-year business here!

49:49.292 --> 49:50.709
Look, the market is in my hands.

49:51.042 --> 49:52.417
If you want to keep talking,

49:52.667 --> 49:54.501
get your supplier and we'll talk together.

49:54.542 --> 49:57.292
I'm leaving in two days.
I want an answer by then!

50:03.959 --> 50:05.417
Don't get mad. Let's drink.

50:06.126 --> 50:07.709
We can drink on our own.

50:07.917 --> 50:08.876
Xiaoqi!

50:21.292 --> 50:23.834
I didn't think that
we'd run into him in this case.

50:24.917 --> 50:26.084
I think that

50:26.834 --> 50:28.167
you should step away

50:28.626 --> 50:30.542
from this case for now.

50:37.251 --> 50:38.667
You're afraid that I'll kill him.

50:43.917 --> 50:44.917
Xinwu,

50:46.917 --> 50:49.292
I was worried when you chose to come here

50:49.334 --> 50:50.834
to be an intelligence officer.

50:51.501 --> 50:55.376
But I decided to send you here anyway

50:55.959 --> 50:59.459
because I trust you to be narcotics officer.

51:04.167 --> 51:05.667
When this is all over,

51:06.209 --> 51:07.709
we'll catch him together.

51:19.209 --> 51:21.334
What exactly went down between him and Jitpong?

51:21.376 --> 51:24.751
The Jitpong today used to be called Xing Deng.

51:24.792 --> 51:27.709
He was a drug dealer in China five years ago.

51:27.834 --> 51:31.459
Fang Xinwu's girlfriend of ten years died
because of him.

51:31.501 --> 51:33.459
Xing Deng fled to the Golden Triangle,

51:33.751 --> 51:36.459
and we've lost track of him since.

52:24.001 --> 52:28.376
Steal all the data
from your boyfriend's computer for me.

52:34.167 --> 52:35.042
One time.

52:35.917 --> 52:37.001
Just this once.

52:40.042 --> 52:41.084
I can't...

52:43.167 --> 52:45.042
I can't do that to him...

52:46.209 --> 52:48.084
Your boyfriend is an narcotics officer.

52:48.876 --> 52:52.376
If everyone knows that his girlfriend is a junkie,

52:52.834 --> 52:55.042
how do you think he'd react?

54:08.459 --> 54:11.042
Win! Win! Win!

54:11.376 --> 54:13.959
Hurry up!

54:20.709 --> 54:21.584
So what?

54:28.001 --> 54:31.042
You are aware of the current situation, right?

54:31.501 --> 54:35.042
I'm positive that this Mr. Qian
is a reliable source.

54:35.501 --> 54:37.626
My guy Jitpong checked him out.

54:43.667 --> 54:45.959
Do a deal with them,

54:46.751 --> 54:49.459
and then we'll see if he deserves a meeting.

54:49.626 --> 54:50.834
We need to find out

54:50.876 --> 54:52.834
whether he's really got deep pockets.

54:58.542 --> 55:00.959
Let's start with five million US dollars.

55:01.876 --> 55:05.334
I'll keep you posted on the drop-off
time and place.

55:46.751 --> 55:47.584
Hey, what's happening?

55:47.626 --> 55:48.917
The deal's on, brother.

55:48.959 --> 55:50.501
I'll let you know the time and place.

55:50.542 --> 55:52.001
Oh yeah...

55:52.626 --> 55:54.709
Alright, I'll tell Mr. Qian right away.

55:56.459 --> 55:57.501
They've taken the bait.

56:06.209 --> 56:08.167
When you first moved here,

56:08.376 --> 56:09.917
did you have a hard time adjusting?

56:10.751 --> 56:11.459
I got by.

56:14.334 --> 56:17.542
From the moment I found out my girlfriend
was an addict,

56:20.251 --> 56:22.959
I knew what I had to do.

56:27.709 --> 56:31.792
Nothing excites me
more than taking down drug dealers every day.

56:38.626 --> 56:41.709
Daddy, do you like cats?

56:44.834 --> 56:46.126
Daddy's little lover.

56:47.251 --> 56:48.584
What a lovely family.

56:50.292 --> 56:51.292
I'm divorced.

56:52.584 --> 56:55.376
My daughter lives with her mother now.

56:57.542 --> 56:59.417
You must miss her, being all the way out here.

57:00.917 --> 57:02.001
Of course I do.

57:24.959 --> 57:27.334
Listen up, Naw Khar has taken our bait.

57:27.501 --> 57:28.709
Their request is to do the exchange

57:28.751 --> 57:32.126
and verify the money
before showing up at the mall.

57:32.334 --> 57:34.667
Panoptes and Ares are in charge of the exchange.

57:34.959 --> 57:38.126
After that,
Ares will back up Icarus' surveillance mission.

57:38.417 --> 57:41.751
Panoptes will join us at the mall immediately.

57:42.001 --> 57:44.167
Let us know as soon as the deal is completed.

57:47.751 --> 57:50.709
Poseidon, Aphrodite, and Hermes,

57:51.042 --> 57:52.709
you'll come with me to the mall.

57:53.042 --> 57:54.626
The mall has a total of four exits.

57:54.709 --> 57:57.209
The Bulls will be stand by outside

57:57.251 --> 57:58.417
to track down any target.

57:59.209 --> 57:59.834
Remember,

58:00.376 --> 58:02.959
we're meeting in a crowded area.

58:03.209 --> 58:05.751
We don't know how many of their guys
are in the crowd.

58:06.042 --> 58:07.709
Be vigilant at all times.

58:20.626 --> 58:22.542
Throw the money to the road below.

58:23.501 --> 58:24.459
Where's my stuff?

58:24.917 --> 58:27.459
Inside the fifth and sixth barrel to your right.

58:54.584 --> 58:56.751
"Distance with target"

59:04.709 --> 59:06.959
Target number four San Kyi spotted!

59:08.001 --> 59:09.459
Icarus, are you sure?

59:12.626 --> 59:13.417
Positive.

59:15.792 --> 59:17.376
When we met last time,

59:18.501 --> 59:20.459
I thought that you looked familiar.

59:23.251 --> 59:25.626
Have you spent time in China?

59:31.209 --> 59:31.792
Hello.

59:32.126 --> 59:33.126
The money is good.

59:33.501 --> 59:34.126
Okay.

59:37.751 --> 59:39.959
Target number three Ya Ta has arrived. East Gate.

59:51.417 --> 59:52.292
They're here.

59:55.167 --> 59:56.084
Hi!

59:57.626 --> 59:58.334
Hello.

59:59.334 --> 01:00:00.667
Allow me to introduce...

01:00:02.542 --> 01:00:03.376
Mr. Ya Ta.

01:00:03.959 --> 01:00:04.751
Mr. Qian.

01:00:06.376 --> 01:00:07.542
Nice to meet you.

01:00:07.876 --> 01:00:08.834
Likewise.

01:00:09.417 --> 01:00:10.167
Have a seat!

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:22.084
Chief.

01:00:22.792 --> 01:00:23.709
What's going on?

01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:24.459
Here.

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:32.459
Here is five million US dollars.

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:34.626
Naw Khar said

01:00:35.001 --> 01:00:36.292
one million

01:00:36.334 --> 01:00:38.542
is for what you did
at the Mekong River.

01:00:39.376 --> 01:00:41.751
As for the rest, please make it clean

01:00:42.084 --> 01:00:46.251
and deposit it to his account
at the Golden Triangle Casino.

01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:49.501
I thought the deal was 1.5 million?

01:00:52.834 --> 01:00:55.667
Naw Khar felt that Boss was against him

01:00:56.001 --> 01:00:58.376
because you are not doing a good job.

01:01:01.876 --> 01:01:02.542
San Kyi,

01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:06.626
Boss has been unhappy with Naw Khar
for some time now.

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:10.001
Just so you know,
under the current circumstances,

01:01:10.209 --> 01:01:14.417
the Naw Khar era could end anytime
if Boss so chooses to.

01:01:17.751 --> 01:01:19.417
As for you, my friend,

01:01:20.626 --> 01:01:22.751
I always thought you have great potential.

01:01:23.709 --> 01:01:25.917
I even mentioned your name to Boss.

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:29.792
They can definitely supply
1.5 billion worth of goods per year,

01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:32.584
but they have some ideas
about the business terms.

01:01:34.584 --> 01:01:35.251
One,

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:37.876
we'll be Mr. Qian's exclusive supplier.

01:01:40.501 --> 01:01:41.209
Two,

01:01:41.876 --> 01:01:44.334
we will be your investing partners
in the Chinese market.

01:01:44.751 --> 01:01:49.001
He takes a beat just before he speaks every time.

01:01:49.042 --> 01:01:52.209
I think that someone is giving him directions.

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:54.584
Aphrodite, go take a look.

01:02:02.709 --> 01:02:05.084
I'm okay with you being our exclusive supplier.

01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:08.417
As for investing in our business,

01:02:10.876 --> 01:02:12.417
can you really handle that?

01:02:12.876 --> 01:02:14.251
As long as the goods keep coming
and the price is right,

01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:15.792
you can be our exclusive supplier.

01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:19.251
But do you have the muscle
to invest in our business?

01:02:19.626 --> 01:02:22.667
We drug dealers print cash like banks.

01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:24.376
Money is not a problem.

01:02:24.459 --> 01:02:27.459
Mr. Qian, we sell drugs.

01:02:28.459 --> 01:02:30.084
Money is never a problem.

01:02:30.584 --> 01:02:33.459
We print cash like banks.

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:36.334
Okay,

01:02:36.792 --> 01:02:38.917
then tell me, how do you want to do it?

01:02:39.792 --> 01:02:45.126
Tell them, I only want the southern region...

01:02:50.709 --> 01:02:52.584
I can hear piano in the background.

01:02:54.084 --> 01:02:55.126
It's on the second floor!

01:03:17.501 --> 01:03:19.709
Naw Khar's son Nah Htuu spotted, second floor.

01:03:20.542 --> 01:03:21.459
Attention, Bulls.

01:03:21.542 --> 01:03:22.876
We have two targets in sight.

01:03:23.126 --> 01:03:24.209
Make Nah Htuu our top target!

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:25.001
Copy!

01:03:31.834 --> 01:03:34.167
Targets are on the way out, three of them!

01:03:37.001 --> 01:03:40.167
Icarus, we must follow that target!

01:03:46.876 --> 01:03:48.126
What's going on?

01:03:53.417 --> 01:03:55.542
Didn't I tell you to be extra careful?

01:03:56.459 --> 01:03:57.667
I'm coming back now.

01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:06.167
"Someone is following you"

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:40.667
(Burmese) Backup! We've got a problem!

01:05:04.959 --> 01:05:06.792
Icarus, do you copy?

01:05:09.292 --> 01:05:11.126
Area, did you see the target walk out?

01:05:11.876 --> 01:05:13.292
Most of the drugs in the south,

01:05:13.417 --> 01:05:15.126
come from the Golden Crescent these days.

01:05:15.292 --> 01:05:17.584
Their price can go 30 percent
below the market rate.

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:19.626
It'll give us a monopoly over the southern region.

01:05:20.001 --> 01:05:21.376
If what you say is true,

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:24.417
then let's give it a try, shall we?

01:05:25.334 --> 01:05:27.459
But I only accept a 60-40 split...

01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:42.584
In addition to investing,

01:05:44.167 --> 01:05:48.251
we also want to set up branches along
the Chinese coastline.

01:05:48.501 --> 01:05:51.126
We'll move the goods to Japan and Korea,

01:05:52.084 --> 01:05:55.167
and you'll be our agent.

01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:00.417
"Distance with target"

01:06:00.501 --> 01:06:01.834
The signal's up ahead

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:03.626
About two, three hundred meters.

01:06:13.709 --> 01:06:15.792
The brown car on the opposite lane.

01:06:33.334 --> 01:06:34.542
The guy at the hotel...

01:06:34.917 --> 01:06:36.209
he's right behind us.

01:06:36.709 --> 01:06:38.042
How did he find us?

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.792
Turn left at the corner ahead.

01:06:46.876 --> 01:06:47.501
Got it.

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:26.042
It's me, Ongsa.

01:07:28.417 --> 01:07:30.459
Something's wrong with the deal!

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:32.542
Heads up.

01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:34.584
Nah Htuu may be leaving the mall.

01:07:41.626 --> 01:07:42.417
Hello?

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:45.126
Ya Ta, they're cops. Leave now!

01:07:47.709 --> 01:07:49.417
Captain, they found out about the money!

01:07:50.126 --> 01:07:51.667
I'm sending over backup now.

01:07:52.084 --> 01:07:52.834
Fine.

01:08:37.626 --> 01:08:39.292
Go after him! I'll cover you!

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:50.376
Get down! Get down!

01:08:51.751 --> 01:08:53.126
Get down! Get down!

01:08:57.917 --> 01:08:58.667
Panoptes!

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:12.292
Aphrodite!

01:09:12.376 --> 01:09:13.126
Go!

01:09:13.876 --> 01:09:15.667
Poseidon! Where are you now?

01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:17.292
I'm at the North Gate!

01:09:52.876 --> 01:09:53.834
Xu!

01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:58.667
Hang in there...

01:10:03.459 --> 01:10:04.542
Hang in there, Xu...

01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:07.417
Poseidon is down!

01:10:07.876 --> 01:10:09.001
We're at the North Gate.

01:10:09.209 --> 01:10:10.334
We need backup right now!

01:10:20.667 --> 01:10:21.917
Get down! Get down!

01:10:52.209 --> 01:10:52.959
Don't move!

01:10:57.292 --> 01:10:57.959
Don't move!

01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:08.167
Get your brother out of the way!

01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:53.876
Bingo, go!

01:12:39.251 --> 01:12:41.751
Freeze! Police!

01:12:44.792 --> 01:12:46.376
The local police are here. Go, Captain!

01:12:46.584 --> 01:12:47.417
We're out of time!

01:12:50.751 --> 01:12:52.501
Don't move! Hands up!

01:13:28.626 --> 01:13:31.792
Captain, I'm sorry.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.959
I was careless.

01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:35.667
And I got Guo Xu...

01:13:35.834 --> 01:13:37.501
Save that for later.

01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:47.376
Chief, how's he doing?

01:13:48.209 --> 01:13:50.876
The child is in stable condition.

01:13:51.292 --> 01:13:53.542
But Guo Xu's leg can't be saved.

01:13:53.917 --> 01:13:55.709
They have to amputate immediately.

01:14:48.042 --> 01:14:50.709
The shopping mall incident was way out of line.

01:14:51.042 --> 01:14:54.876
Boss wants you
to leave the Golden Triangle at once.

01:14:55.167 --> 01:14:57.042
Who the fuck is he anyway?

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:59.417
He's nothing but a pawn out here.

01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:03.542
I'm the master here.

01:15:03.876 --> 01:15:05.501
He should be the one leaving!

01:15:05.959 --> 01:15:08.209
Those guys made a move on us,

01:15:09.292 --> 01:15:11.542
and now he wants me to leave?

01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:14.751
Have you all forgotten who I am?

01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:17.501
Calm down, boss!

01:15:35.417 --> 01:15:39.209
I will find out his location as soon as possible.

01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:43.376
And make sure we locate the gold
before we take him out.

01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:44.709
Sure.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:47.792
I didn't lie to you!

01:15:47.834 --> 01:15:49.709
That's all I know! Let me go!

01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:10.584
Okay! I will talk! Please stop it!

01:16:15.209 --> 01:16:17.001
Won't it seem odd for Chinese boats to ship drugs,

01:16:17.042 --> 01:16:18.459
into the Golden Triangle?

01:16:19.084 --> 01:16:21.126
And killing Chinese nationals?

01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:26.376
I'm worried this is too big for us.

01:16:27.626 --> 01:16:30.126
What's the big fucking deal with
killing a few people?

01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:34.917
It's not the first time Chinese people
have died on the Mekong anyway.

01:16:34.959 --> 01:16:36.376
Kill them all!

01:16:40.126 --> 01:16:41.751
Those fucking chinks,

01:16:41.917 --> 01:16:44.042
they've been looking to use joint patrols
to get us.

01:16:44.334 --> 01:16:46.084
I'll teach them a lesson!

01:16:49.042 --> 01:16:53.126
I don't care if the whole world suspects us.

01:16:53.167 --> 01:16:55.459
No one can touch us!

01:16:57.001 --> 01:16:59.709
I am the master of Mekong River!

01:17:38.917 --> 01:17:42.042
The hiding spots that Ya Ta gave us
have all been emptied out.

01:17:42.251 --> 01:17:44.792
The only lead that we have left

01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:47.334
is Nah Htuu.

01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:50.917
Nah Htuu can easily escape
under local police custody.

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:55.376
So we must grab him while he's still
in the hopsital.

01:17:58.917 --> 01:18:00.251
Let's do it.

01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:32.626
If we're really doing this,

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.251
I'll grab a hostage as a diversion.

01:18:34.584 --> 01:18:35.917
Get him out first.

01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:37.584
Okay.

01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:51.626
Let's tail them.

01:18:54.126 --> 01:18:56.709
Nah Htuu and Jitpong have left the hospital.

01:18:56.751 --> 01:18:58.459
They're on their way back.

01:19:00.626 --> 01:19:03.876
(Burmese) If those chinks dare
to challenge our power,

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:06.959
we'll show them exactly how powerful we are!

01:19:15.834 --> 01:19:18.626
You're my great warrior!

01:19:26.501 --> 01:19:27.501
Stop!

01:19:37.959 --> 01:19:40.126
Come come come! This way!

01:20:59.417 --> 01:21:00.584
My leg!

01:21:02.584 --> 01:21:03.667
Give me your hand!

01:21:06.876 --> 01:21:07.584
My leg!

01:21:07.751 --> 01:21:09.334
It hurts! Slow down!

01:21:09.876 --> 01:21:11.917
Wait, I'll go to the other side!

01:21:17.834 --> 01:21:19.126
Jitpong!

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.542
Jitpong!

01:21:23.417 --> 01:21:24.542
Where have you gone?

01:21:25.126 --> 01:21:26.126
Jitpong!

01:21:26.792 --> 01:21:29.542
Help me out...

01:21:55.542 --> 01:21:56.792
Help me out!

01:21:57.167 --> 01:21:58.251
Help me...

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:04.876
Shut up!

01:22:09.334 --> 01:22:10.251
Throw me the gun!

01:22:12.084 --> 01:22:13.001
Throw me the gun!

01:22:14.626 --> 01:22:15.751
Throw me the damn gun!

01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:36.709
Fang, you can't kill me!

01:22:37.001 --> 01:22:39.667
Killing me won't bring your girlfriend back!

01:22:39.792 --> 01:22:41.126
Please just let me go!

01:22:41.167 --> 01:22:42.501
Let me go!

01:23:56.626 --> 01:23:57.167
Hello?

01:23:57.251 --> 01:23:59.792
Yu Ping, what's the status on Nah Htuu?

01:24:00.126 --> 01:24:02.251
Excuse me, where's the soccer pitch?

01:24:02.376 --> 01:24:05.667
Walk down that way, turn left, then turn right.

01:24:05.834 --> 01:24:07.126
Then go straight.

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.501
Could you repeat that?

01:24:08.876 --> 01:24:10.376
Walk down that way...

01:24:10.792 --> 01:24:13.251
The more time we take, the more evidence we lose.

01:24:15.459 --> 01:24:17.042
I'll sort that out.

01:24:17.292 --> 01:24:19.209
Once we have Naw Khar's position,

01:24:19.334 --> 01:24:20.292
take action right away.

01:24:20.334 --> 01:24:21.626
You're in command.

01:24:31.084 --> 01:24:32.126
You can't come...

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:33.126
Stop!

01:24:33.292 --> 01:24:34.709
Stop him! He's carrying something!

01:24:34.751 --> 01:24:35.709
Stop!

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.667
Nah Htuu...

01:25:51.542 --> 01:25:54.042
Nah Htuu got away...

01:25:56.667 --> 01:25:58.084
Don't worry, chief.

01:26:00.334 --> 01:26:02.084
We've got Nah Htuu.

01:26:02.209 --> 01:26:04.584
He's already given us Naw Khar's location.

01:26:06.876 --> 01:26:11.209
Gao, go get him right away...

01:26:18.584 --> 01:26:21.042
It's gonna get tough for you, Bingo.

01:26:21.084 --> 01:26:22.251
Eat up.

01:26:46.417 --> 01:26:47.667
Daddy's little lover again?

01:26:47.917 --> 01:26:48.917
Yeah.

01:26:51.251 --> 01:26:52.376
Mind if I take a look?

01:26:57.167 --> 01:27:02.792
I'll come after you tonight, daddy...

01:27:03.792 --> 01:27:05.709
Let's take a photo and send it to her.

01:27:05.876 --> 01:27:06.876
Sure.

01:27:37.584 --> 01:27:40.584
Nah Htuu has given us Naw Khar's location,

01:27:41.042 --> 01:27:42.792
but the terrain of the area is complicated.

01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:44.251
Also,

01:27:44.334 --> 01:27:46.751
we can't ascertain what kind of weapons

01:27:46.959 --> 01:27:48.334
the enemies are packing.

01:27:48.667 --> 01:27:50.667
So we have to strike hard and fast.

01:27:52.042 --> 01:27:55.167
We'll split into four teams
and penetrate from south and north.

01:27:55.542 --> 01:27:59.626
Lock down the targets' location ASAP
and nab them at once.

01:28:01.167 --> 01:28:02.834
We're using live ammos this time,

01:28:03.084 --> 01:28:04.042
but remember,

01:28:04.417 --> 01:28:06.251
our mission is to capture Naw Khar

01:28:06.292 --> 01:28:08.167
and his accomplices alive.

01:28:09.042 --> 01:28:10.501
If they are killed,

01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:12.667
then our mission is a failure.

01:28:12.876 --> 01:28:15.876
So please do your best to keep them alive.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:19.834
Helicopters will be standing by.

01:28:20.042 --> 01:28:22.417
Each team gets an extra-strength transmitter.

01:28:23.584 --> 01:28:24.917
Whoever gets the targets,

01:28:24.959 --> 01:28:27.292
retreat to the meeting point immediately.

01:28:27.792 --> 01:28:30.709
Use your transmitter to call the helicopters
for extraction.

01:30:40.542 --> 01:30:41.959
The stove is ready.

01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:09.417
North 1 in position.

01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:19.959
South 2 in position.

01:31:25.792 --> 01:31:27.001
North 2 in position.

01:31:32.292 --> 01:31:33.667
South 1 in position.

01:32:07.209 --> 01:32:07.959
P'Som,

01:32:08.459 --> 01:32:10.709
we don't really know how many of them
are out there.

01:32:14.001 --> 01:32:15.501
Why don't we strike first?

01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:21.209
Just let them fight it out.

01:32:33.334 --> 01:32:35.042
Mr. Zar found Jitpong's body,

01:32:35.126 --> 01:32:37.709
but Sai Nah Htuu is still nowhere to be found.

01:32:42.251 --> 01:32:43.584
Rest assured, boss.

01:32:43.667 --> 01:32:46.126
We will find Sai Nah Htuu as soon as possible.

01:32:48.001 --> 01:32:49.876
What a terrible hand...

01:32:50.917 --> 01:32:51.917
Anyone want to swap?

01:32:52.209 --> 01:32:53.376
Ante up! Quickly!

01:32:54.917 --> 01:32:57.292
Captain Gao, what should we do?

01:33:00.084 --> 01:33:01.584
Don't let them get hurt.

01:33:08.876 --> 01:33:10.626
Ongsa spotted by North 1.

01:33:14.626 --> 01:33:16.292
Captain, North 2 will take Ongsa.

01:33:38.626 --> 01:33:39.542
This is South 1.

01:33:39.667 --> 01:33:40.834
We've located Jarwan.

01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:43.459
This is South 2. We've located Boha.

01:33:43.959 --> 01:33:45.542
Keep a close eye on all targets.

01:33:46.167 --> 01:33:46.834
Copy.

01:33:47.376 --> 01:33:48.126
Copy.

01:33:57.001 --> 01:33:58.667
(Burmese) Where's my breakfast?!

01:33:59.292 --> 01:34:00.501
Naw Khar's location confirmed.

01:34:01.542 --> 01:34:03.001
Do you want to die?!

01:34:04.917 --> 01:34:05.917
Get ready for action.

01:34:21.917 --> 01:34:22.792
Take him out.

01:34:33.042 --> 01:34:34.667
Go see what's going on!

01:34:46.626 --> 01:34:49.292
Stop! Down! Get down!

01:35:00.417 --> 01:35:01.209
Don't move!

01:35:01.751 --> 01:35:02.584
Stay put!

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:17.459
Watch out! Don't hit him!

01:35:59.167 --> 01:36:00.167
We need him alive!

01:36:32.459 --> 01:36:33.126
Be careful.

01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:16.084
Captain, I'm on your nine o'clock.

01:37:16.376 --> 01:37:18.292
Cover me! We're going in!

01:37:33.001 --> 01:37:34.251
(Burmese) Fuck you, you chinks!

01:37:49.001 --> 01:37:49.542
Grenade!

01:38:40.417 --> 01:38:41.792
Enemies approaching!

01:40:15.251 --> 01:40:16.167
Captain.

01:40:17.084 --> 01:40:18.292
We've got injured men here.

01:40:18.334 --> 01:40:20.001
Get them out of here first. Quick!

01:40:59.584 --> 01:41:00.292
Icarus!

01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:30.417
Wait for me at the exit.

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:31.542
Got it, boss.

01:41:39.251 --> 01:41:41.626
Meng, where are you?

01:41:41.876 --> 01:41:42.626
I'm here!

01:41:56.001 --> 01:41:57.292
Go go go!

01:41:59.126 --> 01:42:01.626
Qifu, the helicopters are about to leave,
get your asses over here!

01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:03.126
What's the status of North 1?

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:04.292
Naw Khar escaped.

01:42:04.334 --> 01:42:05.709
Captain Gao and Bingo are after him.

01:42:05.751 --> 01:42:06.626
He's by himself?

01:42:06.792 --> 01:42:07.376
Yes.

01:42:08.001 --> 01:42:09.209
Send me his location.

01:42:24.251 --> 01:42:25.626
This is Captain Gao speaking.

01:42:26.167 --> 01:42:28.209
Naw Khar is inside the cave behind the campsite.

01:42:28.376 --> 01:42:29.334
I'm about to go in.

01:42:29.667 --> 01:42:30.917
Respond if you copy.

01:43:21.792 --> 01:43:23.417
Naw Khar, where is he?

01:43:23.751 --> 01:43:26.417
Go see if there's another exit!

01:43:33.667 --> 01:43:35.334
P'Som, Naw Khar's right here!

01:43:39.292 --> 01:43:40.126
P'Som,

01:43:40.792 --> 01:43:41.959
can you spare me?!

01:44:08.126 --> 01:44:10.251
Don't let Naw Khar get taken by the Chinese!

01:44:34.167 --> 01:44:35.584
Come on, go now!

01:44:53.459 --> 01:44:54.167
Bingo,

01:44:54.459 --> 01:44:55.917
it's your turn to strike.

01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:57.792
I'm counting on you.

01:45:00.209 --> 01:45:01.209
Go!

01:45:52.584 --> 01:45:53.917
GO, Bingo!

01:46:06.751 --> 01:46:08.584
Bingo! Bingo!

01:46:44.126 --> 01:46:45.667
Captain, do you copy?

01:47:14.001 --> 01:47:16.209
Captain, I'm right behind you. Get ready to run!

01:47:20.042 --> 01:47:21.459
Cover the boss, go!

01:49:58.834 --> 01:50:00.001
Captain, do you copy?

01:50:02.584 --> 01:50:04.126
I got Naw Khar by the river.

01:50:04.251 --> 01:50:05.626
He's hurt badly!

01:50:05.792 --> 01:50:07.042
I have attackers on my tail!

01:50:07.126 --> 01:50:08.501
Hang tight! I'm on my way!

01:51:19.626 --> 01:51:21.417
I'm at your seven o'clock, captain!

01:51:25.251 --> 01:51:26.334
If Naw Khar dies,

01:51:26.542 --> 01:51:27.959
you better put a bullet in me.

01:51:28.126 --> 01:51:29.834
You're on your own after that!

01:52:38.626 --> 01:52:39.792
Get closer!

01:52:40.376 --> 01:52:41.626
Get closer!

01:52:57.417 --> 01:52:59.542
We're almost there, captain!

01:54:00.584 --> 01:54:02.584
Captain, I'm at your twelve o'clock.

01:54:02.626 --> 01:54:03.917
Prepare for extraction!

01:54:33.209 --> 01:54:34.709
Cover Fang Xinwu!

01:54:47.167 --> 01:54:49.334
Pull Naw Khar up first!

01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:51.876
Then we'll come back down and save Xinwu!

01:54:52.126 --> 01:54:53.584
Pull him up! Hurry!

01:55:03.292 --> 01:55:05.001
We've come to back you up, P'Som!

01:55:05.042 --> 01:55:06.792
Don't let them leave! Take them down!

01:55:22.084 --> 01:55:23.751
Captain! We can't wait any longer!

01:56:57.751 --> 01:57:00.917
(On November 6, 2012, The Intermediate People's
Court of Kunming convicted)

01:57:00.959 --> 01:57:04.001
(Naw Kham, Hsang Kham, Yi Lai,
Zha Xiha and Zha Bo)

01:57:04.042 --> 01:57:07.167
(of intentional murder, drug trafficking,
kidnapping and hijacking of a vessel.)

01:57:07.251 --> 01:57:09.917
(They were sentenced to death.)

01:57:43.876 --> 01:57:47.251
Fang Xinwu spent too much time in that world.

01:57:47.834 --> 01:57:49.042
People change.

01:57:49.792 --> 01:57:52.459
He was very conflicted at the time.

01:57:54.042 --> 01:57:56.042
After he killed Xing Deng,

01:57:57.042 --> 01:57:59.751
I could sense that he was in pain.

01:58:01.584 --> 01:58:03.792
He didn't change one bit.

01:58:04.251 --> 01:58:05.459
Take comfort in that.

01:58:09.459 --> 01:58:12.292
When the mission is complete,
will you go back to China?

01:58:15.584 --> 01:58:16.626
15 years ago,

01:58:17.584 --> 01:58:19.001
Khun Sa was taken out.

01:58:21.334 --> 01:58:22.917
Then Naw Khar took his place.

01:58:24.292 --> 01:58:25.959
I wonder who the next one will be.
