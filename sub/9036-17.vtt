WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:03.637
[rain splashing]

00:03.671 --> 00:06.174
[thunder rumbling]

00:06.207 --> 00:08.276
- MICHAEL ASLEEP?
- FINALLY.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.443
TRIED EVERYTHING.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.778
I READ TO HIM.
I ROCKED HIM.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.047
HE KEPT LOOKING AT ME LIKE,
"IS THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

00:13.081 --> 00:14.515
IS THAT IT?"

00:16.184 --> 00:18.252
- THE BLUE JAYS AND THE YANKEES
MEET TONIGHT...

00:18.286 --> 00:21.455
- OH, ESPN.
NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT.

00:21.489 --> 00:23.691
NOTHING EVEN COMES CLOSE.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.394
WELL, ESPN2.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.562
- YOU KNOW, RAY,
COULD YOU AT LEAST LOOK AT ME

00:28.596 --> 00:32.200
BEFORE YOU SETTLE IN
FOR THREE HOURS OF TELEVISION?

00:32.233 --> 00:35.269
- I LOOKED AT YOU
WHEN I CAME IN.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.171
- ...WITH A WIN OVER THE ANGELS.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.473
[TV static]
- HEY.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.409
- HA, HA, HA!

00:41.442 --> 00:43.344
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- YEAH, THERE YOU GO.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.847
- OH, NO.
COME ON.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.383
COME ON.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.585
- LOOK, TRY PRESSING
THE ON/OFF BUTTON,

00:51.619 --> 00:53.621
AND TAPPING THE CABLE BOX
WITH THE REMOTE.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.592
NOW HIT THE BACK OF THE SET.

01:00.328 --> 01:03.231
NOW RUB THE SIDES
WITH YOUR HANDS.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.602
A LITTLE HARDER.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.605
GETTING EXCITED, HUH?
[chuckles]

01:11.639 --> 01:12.873
- OH, YOU'RE FUNNY.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.642
YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.
YEAH, YOU'RE FUNNY.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.377
YOU'RE JEALOUS;
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.645
COME ON.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.580
I HATE THIS CABLE COMPANY.
- OH, COME ON, RAY.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.815
IT'S JUST TELEVISION.
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.753
- YOUR TV'S OUT TOO.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.688
SWEET MOTHER OF GOD!

01:31.825 --> 01:34.362
[thunder rumbling]

01:38.666 --> 01:39.867
- OH, COME ON, RAY.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.169
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO SIT HERE

01:41.202 --> 01:42.603
AND WAIT FOR THE CABLE
TO COME BACK ON?

01:42.636 --> 01:43.771
- WELL, HOW LONG
CAN IT BE OUT FOR?

01:43.804 --> 01:45.206
I MEAN, THIS IS CRAZY.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.308
- IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO MINUTES.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.209
- YEAH.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.877
IF YOUR FINGER WAS
STUCK IN A CAR DOOR,

01:49.910 --> 01:51.645
WOULD YOU SAY IT'S ONLY BEEN
TWO MINUTES? NO.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.814
- WHAT?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.783
- I LIKE TV.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.487
- LOOK.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.589
WHY DON'T WE JUST
SIT AND TALK, HMM?

02:01.622 --> 02:04.558
- WHY?
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:04.592 --> 02:05.659
- NOTHING'S WRONG.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.295
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

02:07.328 --> 02:09.330
THAT YOU AND I JUST
SAT HERE AND TALKED?

02:09.363 --> 02:12.466
- THE LAST TIME
THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.535
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST FORGET IT.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.304
- LOOK, DEBRA, YOU KNOW,
I WORK ALL DAY.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.838
AND WHEN I COME HOME,
I JUST--I WANT TO RELAX.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.274
- AND TALKING TO ME
ISN'T RELAXING, HUH?

02:25.913 --> 02:29.317
- [exhales deeply]

02:29.350 --> 02:31.219
OKAY, WE'LL TALK.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.454
- GOOD.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.556
[clears throat]

02:35.589 --> 02:36.824
SO GO AHEAD.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
- WHAT? WHAT?

02:38.892 --> 02:40.194
- SEE, THAT'S WHAT
YOU ALWAYS DO.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.462
YOU ALWAYS SAY,
"HEY, LET'S TALK,"

02:41.495 --> 02:42.930
AND THEN
YOU THROW IT TO ME.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.565
NO, YOU SAY,
"LET'S TALK,"

02:44.598 --> 02:46.634
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOPICS READY.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.205
I'M NOT GOOD--I'M NOT GOOD
WHEN I'M JUST EXPECTED TO TALK.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.507
- "EXPECTED TO TALK"?
- YEAH, YEAH.

02:53.541 --> 02:56.344
I'M GOOD WITH REGULAR TALK,
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH,

02:56.377 --> 02:59.313
"THESE PANTS ARE ITCHY"

02:59.347 --> 03:00.914
OR "HEY, GET DOWN FROM THERE,"
THOSE THINGS.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.516
BUT I'M JUST--
BUT THIS--

03:02.550 --> 03:05.286
- SO TALKING TO ME IS WHAT
YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM WITH.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.655
- NO.
I LOVE TALKING TO YOU.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.858
COME ON. I'D RATHER TALK TO YOU
THAN DO ANYTHING.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.496
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
WE COULD DO--

03:15.529 --> 03:17.331
- WHAT--UH-OH.
HA! NO, NO.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.466
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.467
- I THINK SO.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.402
- NO.
- WHY?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.403
- BECAUSE IT'S--

03:22.436 --> 03:23.437
- IT'S WHAT?

03:23.471 --> 03:24.638
IT'S A MAN AND A WOMAN

03:24.672 --> 03:27.875
JUST SHOWING THEIR LOVE
FOR ONE ANOTHER.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.578
MAYBE EVEN SHOWING IT
DOWNSTAIRS THIS TIME.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.280
- YEAH.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.781
RAY, I'M NOT
HAVING SEX WITH YOU

03:33.814 --> 03:37.385
JUST BECAUSE THE CABLE'S OUT.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.721
- THAT'S NOT JUST WHY.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.290
I MEANT TO TELL YOU.

03:42.323 --> 03:46.294
I WANTED TO WHEN I CAME IN,
REMEMBER?

03:46.327 --> 03:48.762
COME ON; YOU REMEMBER.
WHEN I LOOKED AT YOU.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.400
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.835
WHEN THE CABLE
COMES BACK ON,

03:54.868 --> 03:57.505
I WILL BE HAPPY
TO SHOW MY LOVE FOR YOU.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.441
- ALL RIGHT.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.842
ALL RIGHT, YOU--

04:01.875 --> 04:03.611
WHEN THAT CABLE COMES BACK ON,
YOU GOT A DEAL.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.978
- ALL RIGHT.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.982
- BUT I'LL BE THINKING OF YOU.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.323
MICHAEL STILL UP?
- YEAH.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.525
HE'S GOING TO BE A MESS
TOMORROW.

04:17.558 --> 04:20.428
- YEAH, WELL,
WHAT DOES HE HAVE TOMORROW?

04:20.461 --> 04:23.897
LET'S SEE: I'VE GOT A CRAYON
UP MY NOSE AT 11:00,

04:23.931 --> 04:25.533
AND AT 1:30,
GEOFFREY AND I

04:25.566 --> 04:26.967
ARE GOING TO RUN
AROUND THE HOUSE NAKED,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.604
YELLING
"LADLE, LADLE, LADLE."

04:30.638 --> 04:32.306
[knock on door]

04:32.340 --> 04:33.641
- [grunting]

04:33.674 --> 04:34.708
YOU GOT TV YET?

04:34.742 --> 04:36.577
- NO. YOU?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.312
- I CAN'T STAND IT.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.212
WITHOUT CABLE,

04:39.246 --> 04:42.583
I GOT NOTHING TO LIVE FOR
OVER THERE.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.051
- HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.719
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE WENT
INTO THE APE CAGE

04:45.753 --> 04:48.722
AND TOOK OUT THE TIRE SWING.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.558
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
TALK TO EACH OTHER?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.393
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.028
- WE HAVEN'T HAD A CONVERSATION
IN 35 YEARS.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.065
- I DIDN'T WANT TO INTERRUPT.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.368
- HEY, DID YOU CALL
THE CABLE COMPANY?

05:00.401 --> 05:02.503
- DIDN'T YOU?

05:04.104 --> 05:06.640
YOU LOOK UP THE NUMBER.
I'LL GET THE PHONE READY.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.409
- GET THE PHONE READY?

05:08.442 --> 05:09.577
- GIVE ME, GIVE ME, GIVE ME.
- HERE, HERE.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.778
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.747
LOOK, IF IT'S BUSY,
DIAL 911.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.115
- HELLO.
YEAH, HI.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.618
UH, OUR CABLE'S OUT.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.653
320 FOWLER.

05:19.687 --> 05:20.988
REALLY?
OH, GOD.

05:21.021 --> 05:21.989
- WHAT?
WHAT?

05:22.022 --> 05:22.990
- THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

05:23.023 --> 05:23.991
- THEY DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT IT!

05:24.024 --> 05:26.660
- DEEP BREATHS, FRANK.

05:26.694 --> 05:27.728
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
THANKS. YEAH.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.029
HEY, HEY, HURRY.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.700
- HEY.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.435
CABLE'S OUT.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.905
- IT'S IN THE BIBLE.
NEXT COMES LOCUSTS.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.607
- I'LL TELL YOU,

05:39.640 --> 05:41.609
IT'S A COP'S WORST NIGHTMARE.

05:41.642 --> 05:45.646
CABLE GOES OUT,
PEOPLE GET EDGY.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.948
THANK GOD
THIS ISN'T THE SUMMER.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.850
YOU TAKE AWAY A MAN'S TV
DURING THE HEAT WAVE,

05:49.883 --> 05:51.385
WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
PACK UP THE CANNED GOODS

05:51.419 --> 05:54.154
AND JUST HEAD
FOR THE BASEMENT.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.923
SO WHO WANTS TO RENT
A MOVIE TONIGHT?

05:55.956 --> 05:57.425
- OH.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.026
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT
A BAD IDEA.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.562
IT'S NOT TV, BUT AT LEAST
YOU GOT THE TV GOING.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.431
- THERE YOU GO.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.799
- YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULDN'T MIND
SEEING AGAIN?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.868
"BEACHES."

06:07.901 --> 06:09.470
- I WOULD MIND THAT.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.872
I WOULD MIND THAT
VERY MUCH.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.542
- OKAY. SO FORGET ABOUT
THE MOVIE.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.544
LET'S DO SOMETHING ELSE.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.446
OOH!
LET'S PLAY A GAME.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.647
- OH, YEAH!

06:19.680 --> 06:21.449
- HEY, I'D BE UP FOR THAT.
- A GAME?

06:21.482 --> 06:23.684
- YEAH, THAT'S
A VERY GOOD IDEA, MARIE.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.785
I MEAN, IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE DID SOMETHING TOGETHER

06:24.818 --> 06:26.787
AS A FAMILY FOR ONCE.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.021
- COME ON, DEBRA.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.790
YOU REALLY WANT TO PLAY, LIKE,
A BOARD GAME?

06:29.823 --> 06:31.825
- I DON'T LIKE GAMES.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.961
FOLLOW THE RULES.
PAY ATTENTION.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.097
WAIT YOUR TURN.

06:37.130 --> 06:40.801
IT'S JUST LIKE WORK
DRESSED UP LIKE PLAY.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.870
- COME ON, RAY.
I REALLY WANT TO DO THIS.

06:42.903 --> 06:43.937
- OR YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:43.971 --> 06:46.139
WE COULD JUST SIT AND TALK.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.108
- LET'S PLAY A GAME.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.010
- OKAY, WHAT DOES EVERYBODY
WANT TO PLAY?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.445
- WELL, HOW ABOUT SCRUPLES?

06:51.479 --> 06:53.614
- NO, WE DON'T HAVE
THAT ONE, ROBERT.

06:53.647 --> 06:57.050
- I GAVE IT TO YOU
FOR CHRISTMAS TWO YEARS AGO.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.520
- OH, YES.
SCRUPLES!

06:59.553 --> 07:00.821
HERE IT IS.
REMEMBER THIS, RAY?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.089
- YEAH, THE ONE IN--
THE BOX.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.558
- YEAH.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.960
YEAH, LET'S PLAY THIS.
WE LOVE THIS.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.997
- THE SHRINK WRAP
IS STILL ON IT.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.732
"OH, GEE, THANKS, ROBERT.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.166
THANKS FOR THE GIFT.
YOU HAVE SUCH GREAT TASTE."

07:13.200 --> 07:14.568
YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE OFF
THE SHRINK WRAP

07:14.602 --> 07:15.669
TO PLAY ONE OF THE GAMES...

07:15.703 --> 07:17.771
- ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.
COME ON, ROBERT.

07:17.805 --> 07:22.209
- NO, NO.
I'M FINE.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.913
LET'S JUST PLAY, SHALL WE?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.715
OKAY.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.086
- "GIVE EACH PLAYER
FIVE RED CARDS."

07:33.120 --> 07:34.855
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:34.888 --> 07:36.624
- I'M READING THE RULES.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.225
- JUST PLAY!

07:41.061 --> 07:44.264
- "GIVE EACH PLAYER
FIVE RED CARDS.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.700
"EACH RED CARD HAS
A MORAL QUESTION ON IT.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.836
"FOR EXAMPLE,
'YOU ARE HUNGRY AND BROKE.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.003
DO YOU STEAL FOOD?'"

07:50.037 --> 07:51.972
- "YOUR FAMILY
WANTS TO PLAY A GAME.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.842
DO YOU SET YOURSELF ON FIRE
TO GET OUT OF IT?"

07:56.810 --> 07:59.880
- "GIVE EACH PLAYER A BLUE CARD
WITH A YES-OR-NO ANSWER."

07:59.913 --> 08:01.181
- OKAY, LET ME DO THAT,
'CAUSE I'M GOOD AT CARDS.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.282
- OKAY.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.985
"TAKE TURNS POSING A QUESTION
TO ANOTHER PLAYER."

08:05.018 --> 08:08.589
"IF ANOTHER PLAYER'S ANSWER
MATCHES YOUR ANSWER CARD,

08:08.622 --> 08:11.625
"THEN YOU GET TO DISCARD
THAT QUESTION.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.594
THE OBJECT OF THE GAME
IS TO DISCARD ALL OF--"

08:13.627 --> 08:14.795
DAD, WILL YOU STOP?

08:14.828 --> 08:15.996
- CAN WE JUST START THE GAME?

08:16.029 --> 08:17.631
LET'S PLAY;
THAT'S ALL.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.132
- NO, BUT THERE'S MORE RULES.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:19.166 --> 08:22.169
WE'LL JUST LEARN AS WE PLAY,
ROBERT, OKAY?

08:22.202 --> 08:24.772
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.273
MARIE, MY QUESTION'S FOR YOU.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.941
- GREAT.
SEE, THIS IS FUN.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.710
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.145
"YOU WERE A FAMOUS
MOVIE STAR IN THE 1950s."

08:32.179 --> 08:34.047
- WHOO.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.216
- "BUT NOW YOU ARE
STRAPPED FOR CASH.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.818
"YOU ARE INVITED TO ENDORSE

08:37.851 --> 08:42.890
"A DIAPER FOR BLADDER CONTROL
ON TV.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.892
DO YOU?"

08:44.925 --> 08:47.194
- [laughs]

08:52.600 --> 08:54.301
- WHY DO YOU ASK ME
THAT QUESTION?

08:54.334 --> 08:55.836
YOU THINK
I HAVE THAT PROBLEM?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.338
- WHAT?
NO. I--I JUST--

08:58.371 --> 09:00.708
- YOU THINK I'M OLD?
- NO, NO.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.576
- OH, I NEED A MATCH
AND A CUP OF GASOLINE

09:02.610 --> 09:04.244
RIGHT NOW.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.946
- I'M NOT--I'M NOT
ANSWERING YOU, DEBRA.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.247
- WILL YOU--
MA, COME ON.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.716
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO PLAY THIS GAME.

09:08.749 --> 09:12.219
- THIS ISN'T PLAY.
THIS IS A PERSONAL ATTACK.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.153
- IT'S A QUESTION, MARIE.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.789
- YEAH, A QUESTION
ABOUT MY OLD BLADDER.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.125
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT SHE'D DO.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.694
NOT ONLY WOULD SHE
TAKE THE MONEY;

09:20.728 --> 09:22.596
SHE'D MODEL THE DAMN THINGS.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.933
- OH, I CERTAINLY
WOULD NOT.

09:25.966 --> 09:29.136
- YOU KNOW, I'D ENDORSE
THE PRODUCT IF I USED IT MYSELF.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.871
- ALL RIGHT, COULD WE ASK
ANOTHER QUESTION?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.840
'CAUSE I GOT TO KNOCK
THE LAST COUPLE OF IMAGES

09:32.873 --> 09:34.808
OUT OF MY HEAD.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.845
- LISTEN, IF--IF YOU USED THEM,
YOU'D ADMIT TO IT?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.647
- IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.750
- OOH, ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU HAVE SCRUPLES.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.718
- I GOT SCRUPLES, MARIE.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.187
I GOT SCRUPLES
THE SIZE OF BASKETBALLS.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.756
- AW!

09:50.991 --> 09:52.860
- WHAT ANSWER CARD
DID YOU HAVE, DEBRA?

09:52.893 --> 09:55.295
- WELL, I HAD A "YES" CARD,
SO I GUESS I LOSE.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.964
- THAT'S RIGHT; YOU LOSE.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.000
YOU HAVE TO GET ANOTHER CARD.
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.671
- OH, RAY, LOOK,
HE'S UP AGAIN.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.105
COULD YOU GO CHECK ON HIM?
- YEAH.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.174
- I'LL GO.
- NO, DAD, I WANT TO GO.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.810

10:11.144 --> 10:12.713
- OKAY, IT'S MY TURN.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.649
OH, THIS QUESTION.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.285
THIS QUESTION'S FOR RAYMOND.

- NO. NO. NO.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.097
I WOULD NOT TAKE
SOMEONE'S UMBRELLA, NO.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.066
- I WISH TO CHALLENGE YOU.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.201
- CHALLENGE?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.402
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, CHALLENGE.

TO HEAR THE RULES.

TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY

10:44.878 --> 10:46.146
THAT YOU'RE NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH,

10:46.179 --> 10:48.215
AND THEN YOU GET 20 SECONDS
TO LIE SOME MORE,

10:48.248 --> 10:51.685
AND THEN WE VOTE.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.921
- WHY WOULD I LIE?

- HA! WHY WOULD YOU LIE?

I WAS ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL,
AND MOM YELLED,

11:08.802 --> 11:12.439
"ROBBIE, DON'T FORGET
YOUR RUBBER BOOTS."

11:14.141 --> 11:17.410
BUT THOSE BOOTS
WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.079
YOU KNOW WHY, RAYMOND?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.914
- I DIDN'T TOUCH YOUR BOOTS.

11:20.948 --> 11:21.949
- WHEN I SHOWED UP TO SCHOOL,

11:21.982 --> 11:24.151
THE KIDS CALLED ME
"SASQUISH."

11:26.854 --> 11:30.057
BECAUSE OF YOUR THIEVERY,
I WAS HUMILIATED,

11:30.090 --> 11:32.025
VICTIMIZED.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.027
I VOWED
THAT FROM THAT DAY FORWARD,

11:34.061 --> 11:37.765
I WOULD DO WHATEVER I HAD TO DO
TO FIGHT CRIME.

11:37.798 --> 11:41.869
AND SO TODAY
I AM A POLICE OFFICER.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.774
OKAY,
NOW YOU HAVE 20 SECONDS.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.674
GO!

11:51.244 --> 11:54.281
- I DID NOT TAKE
YOUR RUBBER BOOTS, ROBERT.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.951
THAT'S IT.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.087
THAT'S ALL.
I'M DONE, ROB. I'M--

12:00.120 --> 12:01.454
- TIME.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.092

THAT RAYMOND THE BOOT THIEF

AGAINST ONE OF MY SONS.

- OKAY, TAKING RAYMOND'S SIDE.
THAT'S TYPICAL.

- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.110
- THANK YOU, DEBRA.

- WHAT IS THIS?
- WHAT? COME ON, RAY.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.080
YOU DIDN'T MAKE
MUCH OF AN ARGUMENT.

- WHY WOULD I LIE
ABOUT TAKING HIS GALOSHES?

YOU LOVE TALKING TO ME.

FRANK NEEDS SOME HELP.

- THAT KID'S GOT
AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.831
- WHAT DID YOU DO, FRANK?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.198
- WELL, NOTHING.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.467
I JUST DID A LITTLE
PEEK-A-BOO WITH HIM.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.401
PEEK-A-BOO!

12:52.272 --> 12:55.475
- YEAH, ME TOO.
ME TOO.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.977
DON'T DO THAT.

- OH, COME ON.
I DIDN'T LIE.

- REMEMBER WHEN
HE TOOK MY BOOTS?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.822
- HEY, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:16.163 --> 13:19.432
- YES, BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES
THIS GAME TEACH MORAL VALUES,

13:19.466 --> 13:22.035
IT BRINGS FAMILIES TOGETHER.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.971

SOMETHING ELSE.

HOWEVER LONG
THE CABLE IS OUT,

I'M GOING TO TAKE
TWICE THAT MUCH OFF MY BILL.

HOW DID I DIE?

LET'S JUST SAY
I ONLY HAVE ONE SON.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.339
OKAY, LET'S GO ON
WITH THE GAME.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.574
- MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT I DIED.

16:14.607 --> 16:20.713
MAYBE I JUST SORT OF TOOK OFF
AND BOUGHT A BOAT AND--

16:20.747 --> 16:23.183
AND NOW I'M SAILING...

16:23.216 --> 16:25.385

IS SO INVIGORATING.

AH, HARRIET.
OOH.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.669
THAT SHE COULD
MOVE IN HERE WITH US?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.537
- WELL, THAT WAS JUST SO
WE COULD KEEP PLAYING THE GAME.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.538
THAT'S ALL.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.407
THIS GREAT GAME.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.609
- RAY, SHE'S GOING
TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.345
HOW CAN YOU JUST MAKE
SUCH A DECISION BY YOURSELF?

16:52.379 --> 16:54.781
- THERE WAS NO DECISION THERE.
I WAS ANSWERING A QUESTION.

- I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
TALKING TO ME, RAY,

16:57.284 --> 16:58.818
BUT I THOUGHT THAT AT LEAST
WE WOULD DISCUSS IT

ABOUT HER MOVING IN. OKAY.

I-I WAS JUST KIDDING!

- YES.

SOONER THAN I PLANNED.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.888
YOU WENT, "HMM, OOH."

18:08.921 --> 18:10.890
WHAT WAS THAT?

18:10.923 --> 18:14.261
- RAY, IF I PAUSED, IT WAS JUST
TO PICTURE YOU SNORKELING.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.463
- OH, YOU KNOW,
YOU--YOU'RE SO OBVIOUS.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.265
YOU'RE JUST MAD AT ME
BECAUSE OF THE OTHER THING.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.167
- WHAT OTHER THING?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.568
- NOTHING, NOTHING.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.570
- YOU MOVING IN.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.676
- IS--IS THAT WHY DEBRA
FOLLOWED YOU IN THE KITCHEN?

18:29.709 --> 18:30.710
TO YELL AT YOU?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.713
- NO.

18:33.746 --> 18:37.250
- TALK ABOUT PAUSES.
[laughs]

18:37.284 --> 18:38.485
- RAY.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.619
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TAKE A LIGHTER

18:39.652 --> 18:41.821
AND A CAN OF HAIR SPRAY.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.456
- DEBRA, WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO HIM IN THERE?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.492
- IT WAS RAY!
RAY'S THE ONE THAT SAID IT.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.227
- ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT SAYING
ANYTHING ANYMORE, OKAY?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.060
THAT'S ALL.
NO MORE QUESTIONS.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.330
- WELL, WHEN YOUR MOTHER
SHOWED UP--

18:50.363 --> 18:51.831
- HEY, YOU HAD A PROBLEM
WITH MY MOTHER?

18:51.864 --> 18:52.832
- A HORRIBLE WOMAN.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.866
- THAT WOMAN WAS A SAINT!

18:53.900 --> 18:55.268
- YOU LET HER MOVE IN

18:55.302 --> 18:56.669
WITHOUT EVEN DISCUSSING IT
WITH ME.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.738
- [Robert singing]
INCHWORM

18:58.771 --> 19:00.873
INCHWORM

19:00.907 --> 19:06.346
MEASURING THE MARIGOLDS

19:06.379 --> 19:10.450
YOU AND YOUR ARITHMETIC

19:10.483 --> 19:14.721
YOU'LL CERTAINLY GO FAR

19:14.754 --> 19:19.392
INCHWORM, INCHWORM

19:19.426 --> 19:24.431
MEASURING THE MARIGOLDS

19:24.464 --> 19:29.336
SEEMS TO ME
YOU'D STOP AND SEE

19:29.369 --> 19:32.872
HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE

19:47.854 --> 19:51.190
- YOU KNOW WHO USED TO SING YOU
TO SLEEP WITH THAT SONG?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.362
MY MOTHER!
- OH, A HORRIBLE WOMAN!

19:55.395 --> 19:56.529
- OH, COME ON,
WHY DO YOU START?

19:56.563 --> 19:57.764
- SHE WAS A SAINT!

19:57.797 --> 19:59.232
- I DIDN'T LIKE HER,
BUT I STILL TOOK HER IN,

19:59.266 --> 20:01.301
NOT LIKE SOME PEOPLE.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.570
- MARIE, I LIKE YOU.
DAMN IT, I LIKE YOU!

20:03.603 --> 20:05.905
- PLEASE, HUH?
CAN'T WE PLAY QUIETLY?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.740
I JUST PUT THE KID TO BED.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.280
- I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
WITH THIS GROUP.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.881
I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH HERE TONIGHT.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.449
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:16.483 --> 20:17.850
- YOU LIED.
YOU MADE UP QUESTIONS.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.821
THE GAME IS CALLED SCRUPLES,
MARIE, SCRUPLES!

20:21.854 --> 20:22.822
- YOU RAYMOND BARONE?

20:22.855 --> 20:24.023
- YEAH, YEAH.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.024
- I'M FROM LYNBROOK CABLE.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.727
- OH, HO, HO!
FINALLY!

20:27.760 --> 20:29.829
OH, GOD, THIS IS GREAT.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.766
- OH, IT'S NOT GREAT FOR YOU.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.768
YOU GOT AN ILLEGAL
CABLE SPLITTER ON YOUR ROOF.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.470
- I DO?

20:37.504 --> 20:39.572
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.007
OH, AND IT'S
A REAL CHEAP ONE.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.942
THAT'S WHY YOUR CABLE SERVICE
WENT OUT.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.011
- RAY, I'M SURPRISED AT YOU.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.045
- WHAT DID YOU DO, RAY?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.480
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.349
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A SPLITTER IS.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.518
- IT SPLITS YOUR SIGNAL,
AND IT SENDS IT SOMEWHERE ELSE--

20:51.551 --> 20:52.619
AND IN THIS CASE,

20:52.652 --> 20:55.388
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
TO THAT HOUSE.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.293
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:00.327 --> 21:03.029
- OH, I WAS JUST GOING
TO GET SOME COCOA.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.064
- YOU'VE BEEN STEALING CABLE?

21:05.097 --> 21:07.334
- YOU'RE STEALING CABLE
FROM YOUR OWN SON?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.735
- SHARING.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.538
- HEY, LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE A REAL NICE FAMILY.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.740
I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING
TO WORK THIS ALL OUT.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.775
BUT RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A $2,500 FINE.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.477
- [gasps]

21:17.510 --> 21:19.346
- HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.949
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE, PAL.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.985
IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.
MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT RIGHT.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.463
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.897
YOU CANNOT JUDGE ME

21:37.930 --> 21:40.467
UNTIL YOU'VE WALKED
IN MY SHOES.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.471
- THAT BRINGS UP
AN INTERESTING POINT, DAD.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.339
WHAT SIZE SHOES WOULD THOSE BE?

21:46.373 --> 21:48.575
ABOUT A 12, RIGHT?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.410
- SO WHAT?

21:52.945 --> 21:55.582
- ROBERT, WHEN YOU WERE 11,

21:55.615 --> 21:59.085
WHAT SIZE GALOSHES
DID YOU WEAR?

21:59.118 --> 22:00.086
- 12.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.695
- NO MORE GAMES!

22:12.164 --> 22:13.666
- DON'T WORRY.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.667
WHEN I MOVE IN HERE,

22:14.701 --> 22:16.469
WE'LL PLAY GAMES
ALL THE TIME.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.780
- OKAY, RAY, NOW THAT
THE CABLE'S BACK,

22:27.814 --> 22:29.449
I'M GOING TO GO UPSTAIRS
AND GO TO SLEEP.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.617
- ALL RIGHT.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.887
- UNLESS YOU WANT TO COLLECT
ON OUR DEAL.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.462
- COMMERCIAL!

22:42.495 --> 22:45.432
[thudding footsteps]
