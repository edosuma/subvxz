WEBVTT

00:02.328 --> 00:06.232
("As Time Goes By"
by Henry Mancini playing)

00:15.909 --> 00:17.911
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

00:21.881 --> 00:23.950
How long you had that thing?

00:23.983 --> 00:26.652
Had the computer
replicate it last week.

00:26.686 --> 00:28.955
I'm trying to warm the place up
a little bit, you know?

00:28.988 --> 00:30.389
Get a nice vibe going.

00:30.423 --> 00:33.960
The late-night jazz,
depressed-guy-at-the-bar vibe?

00:33.993 --> 00:35.561
I can help you with that.

00:35.594 --> 00:38.732
-There you go.
-Thanks.

00:38.765 --> 00:40.466
Yeah, I'm gonna have to request

00:40.499 --> 00:43.336
an extra monthly shipment
of this stuff just for you, Cap.

00:45.538 --> 00:48.407
You know what
the worst days are, Olix?

00:48.441 --> 00:51.544
The days when you
can't stay busy.

00:51.577 --> 00:55.915
No Krill confrontations,
no spatial anomalies,

00:55.949 --> 00:57.917
just nothing going on

00:57.951 --> 01:00.653
and all your thoughts
just march inward.

01:00.686 --> 01:03.522
-So most days.
-Hey.

01:03.556 --> 01:05.224
Mind if I join you?

01:05.258 --> 01:08.227
Alara. No. Pull up a chair.
I can use an extra liver.

01:08.261 --> 01:10.263
Xelayans don't have livers.

01:10.296 --> 01:12.331
I'll have a double...

01:12.365 --> 01:15.935
Double Xelayan tequila.
Here you go.

01:15.969 --> 01:17.703
Oh, boy.
Am I that much of a lush?

01:17.737 --> 01:19.906
(laughs)

01:23.309 --> 01:25.278
If you want to be alone,
I could take off.

01:25.311 --> 01:27.180
No, no, you're all good.

01:27.213 --> 01:30.249
It's just, um, I see you in here
a lot lately, you know?

01:30.283 --> 01:31.885
After hours.

01:31.918 --> 01:33.753
Oh, my God, don't tell me
the crew is talking.

01:33.787 --> 01:36.790
No, no, nothing like that.
It's just...

01:36.823 --> 01:40.760
Look, I know it's
none of my business,

01:40.794 --> 01:45.899
but if you ever need an ear,
I've got two, big, pointy ones.

01:45.932 --> 01:48.634
No, that's nice of you, but
there's nothing I can tell you

01:48.667 --> 01:50.469
-the whole crew
doesn't already know.
-(chuckles)

01:50.503 --> 01:53.739
Believe me, I get it.

01:53.773 --> 01:57.076
I'm used to people talking
about my love life.

01:57.110 --> 02:01.747
You know, there are times when
I feel like you and I are

02:01.781 --> 02:03.783
more alike than
any two people on the ship.

02:03.817 --> 02:06.419
How so?

02:06.452 --> 02:08.587
Well, we both know
we're good at our jobs

02:08.621 --> 02:11.124
and yet we also seem
to be the only two people

02:11.157 --> 02:14.928
who are haunted by this little
voice that's always whispering

02:14.961 --> 02:18.397
that we don't really deserve
to be here.

02:18.431 --> 02:22.601
-And we're both alcoholics.
-Heads up. It's a party.

02:22.635 --> 02:25.138
Hey, Bortus.
Pull up a chair.

02:25.171 --> 02:27.240
I do not wish to imbibe, sir.

02:27.273 --> 02:29.843
I am here to request
that we alter course.

02:29.876 --> 02:31.477
Alter course? To where?

02:31.510 --> 02:34.113
-Moclus.
-ED: Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up.

02:34.147 --> 02:36.182
This is, this is not
another baby thing, is it?

02:36.215 --> 02:38.151
No. Sir, you are aware

02:38.184 --> 02:40.686
that Moclans urinate
only once per year.

02:40.719 --> 02:44.657
-I am, yeah.
-It is my time.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.295
Well, you wanted
something to do.

02:56.302 --> 02:58.304
*

03:28.034 --> 03:30.036
*

04:07.640 --> 04:10.709
Okay. Now, I know
this is gonna sound

04:10.743 --> 04:12.278
utterly insane to most of you

04:12.311 --> 04:14.447
and your first instinct
may be to laugh,

04:14.480 --> 04:16.549
but we're all going
to take this seriously,

04:16.582 --> 04:18.251
so I don't want
to hear any jokes,

04:18.284 --> 04:20.419
no snide remarks, nothing.

04:20.453 --> 04:24.390
Now... Kelly?

04:25.925 --> 04:28.794
We're diverting course to Moclus

04:28.827 --> 04:32.198
to... watch Bortus pee.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.767
You want to, you want
to elaborate on that?

04:34.800 --> 04:38.604
-(door whooshes open)
-I am sorry to be late, Captain.

04:38.637 --> 04:40.539
No, Bortus, actually,
you're just in time.

04:40.573 --> 04:44.143
I think it's best if you explain
the ceremony to the group.

04:44.177 --> 04:46.946
Yes, sir.

04:46.980 --> 04:51.384
Once a year, every Moclan must
prepare for his Ja'loja,

04:51.417 --> 04:52.952
the Great Release.

04:52.986 --> 04:55.989
They must travel
to their N'kafas,

04:56.022 --> 04:58.557
a place they select
during childhood.

04:58.591 --> 05:01.727
There, amidst family and
friends, a Moclan urinates,

05:01.760 --> 05:04.330
signifying a cleansing
of the spirit

05:04.363 --> 05:07.466
and the beginning of a new year
in his life.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.469
As you are my closest friends,
I would like you to be there.

05:10.503 --> 05:14.840
What if it's, like, a windy day?

05:14.873 --> 05:17.343
The ceremony is followed
by a celebration

05:17.376 --> 05:19.478
for which the captain
has allowed the use

05:19.512 --> 05:20.946
of the Orville's mess hall.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.582
You are all invited
to attend with a mate.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.951
Okay. Any questions?

05:25.985 --> 05:28.654
Yeah, like a million,
but I'm not gonna ask.

05:28.687 --> 05:30.990
Union Central has granted
clearance for the diversion

05:31.024 --> 05:33.426
as the course aligns
with outpost 58,

05:33.459 --> 05:35.194
where, as you all know,
we're scheduled

05:35.228 --> 05:37.630
to take on board our new
dark matter cartographer.

05:37.663 --> 05:41.000
And Bortus, if you need any
time off to make preparations,

05:41.034 --> 05:43.436
-feel free to relieve yourself.
-(snorts)

05:43.469 --> 05:46.139
No, it's-it's okay, man.

05:46.172 --> 05:48.474
-He's just taking
the piss out of you.
-Okay, that's it.

05:48.507 --> 05:50.476
Dismissed. We're done.
We're done.

06:05.391 --> 06:08.627
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

06:08.661 --> 06:12.231
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:12.265 --> 06:16.169
Listen, I know we haven't
talked much lately,

06:16.202 --> 06:20.706
but I want to have a
conversation with you about us.

06:20.739 --> 06:23.542
You know what? Stop right there.
You don't have to say it.

06:23.576 --> 06:25.511
-I don't?
-No, you don't.

06:25.544 --> 06:30.049
Look, I have been drowning
in late-night bourbons

06:30.083 --> 06:32.051
and I haven't been myself
for a while.

06:32.085 --> 06:33.852
I should've communicated
with you and I didn't.

06:33.886 --> 06:35.188
That's totally understandable.

06:35.221 --> 06:37.690
But-but let me finish.
Let me finish.

06:37.723 --> 06:41.194
If you want to give this
another shot, I'm in.

06:43.229 --> 06:45.098
I'm seeing someone.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.268
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

06:49.302 --> 06:52.004
-I am, I am an idiot.
-No. No, you're not.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.406
-I am a complete
and total jackass.
-Ed, you are not an idiot.

06:53.439 --> 06:54.540
-Listen to me.
-Who-who-who is it?

06:54.573 --> 06:56.041
-Who are you seeing?
-It's not important.

06:56.075 --> 06:57.743
-Why? Is it someone I know?
-It's not important.

06:57.776 --> 06:59.712
Look, you're gonna meet him.
I just, I wanted you to know.

06:59.745 --> 07:01.547
-Where? Wh-where am I
gonna meet him?
-I was...

07:01.580 --> 07:05.518
I was thinking about bringing
him to Bortus's Ja'loja party

07:05.551 --> 07:07.386
and I-I didn't want you
to be caught off guard.

07:07.420 --> 07:10.089
How long has this been going on?

07:10.123 --> 07:12.725
-About a month.
-A month?!

07:12.758 --> 07:14.727
Ed, I know what happened
between us has been hard on you

07:14.760 --> 07:16.862
and I don't know,
I guess I just,

07:16.895 --> 07:19.064
I wanted to give you time
to heal a bit.

07:19.098 --> 07:20.866
Wow. You-you really do not know

07:20.899 --> 07:22.568
what is going on
in my head, do you?

07:22.601 --> 07:25.271
Kelly, this is not a heal up
and move on kind of thing.

07:25.304 --> 07:27.540
Okay? I still love you.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.642
I-I haven't been able
to function.

07:29.675 --> 07:31.444
I've been trying to figure out
how to keep my brain busy

07:31.477 --> 07:33.212
just so I can stop
thinking about...

07:33.246 --> 07:35.381
You know, I-I played backgammon
with Isaac last week, Kelly.

07:35.414 --> 07:38.151
Backgammon. That is
a low point for a man.

07:38.184 --> 07:39.485
You're trying to tell me
you still don't understand

07:39.518 --> 07:40.486
why this doesn't work?

07:40.519 --> 07:41.954
Do you still love me?

07:41.987 --> 07:46.125
Let me pitch
a hypothetical here.

07:46.159 --> 07:49.662
We're orbiting a planet and you
have to assemble a landing party

07:49.695 --> 07:51.730
for a mission that's essential
to save lives,

07:51.764 --> 07:54.133
but guaranteed to be fatal
to the team.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.135
Whoever goes down there dies.

07:56.169 --> 07:59.104
Bortus and I are equally
qualified to lead the mission.

07:59.138 --> 08:00.506
Which one do you send?

08:00.539 --> 08:03.108
What are the specifics
of the scenario?

08:03.142 --> 08:04.443
Doesn't matter. Who do you pick?

08:04.477 --> 08:06.345
-What's the required skill set?
-We both qualify.

08:06.379 --> 08:07.646
See, I would have to have
more information...

08:07.680 --> 08:09.114
You can't answer
and that's the point.

08:09.148 --> 08:10.449
You shouldn't have to.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.685
Come on. Any two officers,
that would be a tough call.

08:12.718 --> 08:14.987
You're trying to tell me you
would send the woman you love?

08:15.020 --> 08:16.955
Really? And in that scenario,

08:16.989 --> 08:19.292
just think about how that
devalues Bortus's life.

08:19.325 --> 08:21.660
How do I know what I would do
in that situation? Who would?

08:21.694 --> 08:24.163
And I don't want either of us to
ever have to make that choice.

08:24.197 --> 08:26.031
Ed, timing is everything.

08:26.064 --> 08:28.033
Oh, come on. That's a clichÃ©
and it's a bunch of crap.

08:28.066 --> 08:29.134
-No, it's not.
-It is.

08:29.168 --> 08:30.436
People love saying that

08:30.469 --> 08:31.837
but it blows free will
out the air lock.

08:31.870 --> 08:33.339
If two people care
about each other,

08:33.372 --> 08:35.974
the choice to love
should transcend timing

08:36.008 --> 08:38.010
and anything less is cowardice.

08:40.213 --> 08:44.183
I'm gonna go check in
with outpost 58.

08:44.217 --> 08:47.019
(door whooshes open)

08:47.052 --> 08:49.222
(door whooshes shut)

09:09.041 --> 09:11.043
*

09:23.456 --> 09:26.359
My God. This ship is amazing.

09:26.392 --> 09:28.193
Your file said
this is your first posting

09:28.227 --> 09:31.230
-on an exploratory vessel?
-First time. Yep. Can't wait.

09:31.264 --> 09:34.199
Well, it's a great crew.
You're gonna like it here.

09:34.233 --> 09:36.535
And this is our captain.

09:36.569 --> 09:38.203
Sir, this is Lieutenant Tyler,

09:38.237 --> 09:40.506
-our new dark matter
cartographer.
-Oh, hey.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.275
-Pleasure to have you on board.
-Oh, please.

09:42.308 --> 09:44.343
Pleasure's mine, sir.
I've been posted mostly

09:44.377 --> 09:46.044
on science vessels and outposts,

09:46.078 --> 09:48.213
so I am really excited
to be here.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.582
An explorer at heart, huh?

09:49.615 --> 09:52.017
Since I was a kid.
You have no idea.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.554
Visiting uncharted planets
and meeting new species--

09:55.588 --> 09:57.055
this is a dream come true.

09:57.089 --> 09:59.625
Uh, can I ask
our course heading?

09:59.658 --> 10:01.193
We're on our way to watch

10:01.226 --> 10:03.061
our second officer
go to the bathroom.

10:03.095 --> 10:05.097
Anyway, welcome.

10:05.130 --> 10:06.799
(laughs awkwardly)

10:09.134 --> 10:11.537
Our first officer,
Commander Grayson.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.872
Lieutenant Janel Tyler
reporting for duty, sir.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.941
Commander Kelly Grayson.
Welcome aboard.

10:15.974 --> 10:18.110
If you don't mind,
I'd like to familiarize myself

10:18.143 --> 10:20.313
with your navigational array.

10:20.346 --> 10:23.148
-It's all yours.
-Thanks.

10:25.150 --> 10:27.386
Hi.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.555
Gordon Malloy.
Welcome to the Orville.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.458
Thank you. I was just telling
your security chief

10:32.491 --> 10:34.960
-how excited I am to be here.
-(chuckles): That's awesome.

10:34.993 --> 10:36.429
(quietly):
Awesome.

10:36.462 --> 10:38.564
Yeah, it's...
it's pretty great.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.799
-I bet.
-Yeah.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.302
I-I-I love it here.

10:44.937 --> 10:49.475
Like, I know for a lot of people
work is work, you know?

10:49.508 --> 10:51.143
But for me...

10:51.176 --> 10:53.446
coming...
coming in here every day

10:53.479 --> 10:56.114
is like...

10:56.148 --> 10:57.950
that's not work.

10:57.983 --> 10:59.852
You know? I'm al...
I'm always like,

10:59.885 --> 11:02.488
"Really? This is my job?
How did I win at life?"

11:02.521 --> 11:05.190
But... I did.

11:05.223 --> 11:07.292
I won.

11:07.326 --> 11:08.827
Yeah.

11:08.861 --> 11:10.463
I mean...

11:10.496 --> 11:14.032
look, if I'm,
if I'm not playing my guitar...

11:14.066 --> 11:16.201
this is where I want to be.

11:16.234 --> 11:17.636
Right here.

11:17.670 --> 11:20.005
-You play the guitar?
-Hmm?

11:20.038 --> 11:22.307
-I said, you play the guitar?
-I do.

11:22.341 --> 11:24.977
I do, yeah.
Yeah, I think it's important

11:25.010 --> 11:28.013
for a man to know how to play
an instrument, you know?

11:28.046 --> 11:29.782
(chuckles):
Yeah.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.017
If these fingers could talk.

11:34.753 --> 11:38.391
(Beethoven's "Fur Elise"
playing)

11:42.327 --> 11:43.529
Now you try.

11:45.764 --> 11:47.766
(playing "Fur Elise")

11:53.205 --> 11:54.707
Very good, Ty.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.642
-You have been practicing.
-Yeah.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.911
Mom makes me practice
a half hour every day.

11:58.944 --> 12:01.346
How long did it take you
to learn piano?

12:01.380 --> 12:03.982
Approximately one-millionth
of a nanosecond.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.451
Wow.

12:07.252 --> 12:10.489
Hey there.
How's my little Mozart doing?

12:10.523 --> 12:12.525
His technique
is improving, Doctor.

12:12.558 --> 12:14.393
I believe he is ready
to begin exploring

12:14.427 --> 12:16.194
more challenging pieces.

12:16.228 --> 12:18.664
Looking good there,
big guy. Mwah!

12:18.697 --> 12:21.434
Isaac said I'm
"very adequate for a human."

12:21.467 --> 12:23.902
Oh, yeah? Well,
go get cleaned up for dinner.

12:26.238 --> 12:29.608
Hey, Mom, can James and I
go to the simulator?

12:29.642 --> 12:31.910
-I assume this is James?
-Yeah.

12:31.944 --> 12:34.212
Hello, James.
I'm Marcus's mom.

12:34.246 --> 12:35.414
Hey.

12:35.448 --> 12:37.282
Dinner's in half an hour.

12:37.315 --> 12:38.884
You finish your homework?

12:38.917 --> 12:41.053
-Yeah.
-Okay. Let's see it.

12:41.086 --> 12:43.589
-I don't have it on me.
-Then where is it?

12:43.622 --> 12:46.425
-I did it at school.
-Then go get it,

12:46.459 --> 12:49.695
and maybe you can go
to the simulator.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.431
-Bro, is your mom always
such a pain in the ass?
-James...

12:52.465 --> 12:54.633
do I know your parents?

12:54.667 --> 12:56.869
-I don't know.
-Well, I'm sure they

12:56.902 --> 12:59.237
want you home for dinner,
too, so I suggest

12:59.271 --> 13:01.874
you scoot your own ass
on out of here. Now.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.208
Later, man.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.444
No. Mom!

13:05.478 --> 13:06.879
What the hell is your problem?

13:06.912 --> 13:07.980
That was my friend.

13:08.013 --> 13:09.882
A) You watch your mouth;
and B)

13:09.915 --> 13:12.384
That's not the kind of friend
I want you hanging around with.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.587
Well, everybody at school
likes him.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.889
And you don't even know him,
so how can you talk?

13:16.922 --> 13:18.757
You really want to be friends
with someone

13:18.791 --> 13:20.959
who calls your mother
a pain in the ass?

13:20.993 --> 13:22.661
I'll be in my room.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.937
Nobody told me
it would be this bad.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.906
Is there a reason
your son has become

13:33.939 --> 13:36.642
-uncharacteristically combative?
-Isaac,

13:36.675 --> 13:38.276
I have no idea.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.412
I never raised
a teenager before,

13:40.445 --> 13:43.582
and I don't have a clue
as to how to get to him.

13:43.616 --> 13:46.418
It's like he hates me
for no reason.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.487
Have you examined him
for unidentified viruses

13:48.521 --> 13:50.489
or neurological disease?

13:50.523 --> 13:52.257
No, of course not.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.259
If he is carrying
a biological foreign agent

13:54.292 --> 13:56.128
that could infect
the rest of the crew...

13:56.161 --> 13:58.096
No, Isaac, he's-he's not sick.

13:58.130 --> 14:01.634
He's just... growing up,
and I can't stop it.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.637
Are there not chemical compounds
that could effectively stunt

14:04.670 --> 14:05.971
his physical development?

14:06.004 --> 14:07.706
My gosh,
what's the matter with you?

14:07.740 --> 14:09.808
I am merely trying to assist.

14:09.842 --> 14:13.712
Okay, well, then just...
play something sweet and jazzy.

14:16.148 --> 14:19.217
(playing "As Time Goes By")

14:30.095 --> 14:32.497
*

14:43.041 --> 14:45.443
*

14:47.846 --> 14:49.915
(whirring, beeping)

14:52.450 --> 14:54.152
We shouldn't be doing this.

14:54.186 --> 14:55.854
Shut up. I'm almost there.

14:55.888 --> 14:57.556
What if somebody comes in?

14:57.590 --> 14:59.224
These are empty quarters. Chill.

14:59.257 --> 15:01.393
My mom's gonna kill me
if she finds out.

15:01.426 --> 15:03.461
I'm gonna kill you
if you don't shut up.

15:05.263 --> 15:06.932
-(whirrs, beeps)
-Ah.

15:06.965 --> 15:08.734
Ha-ha! Yes!

15:10.368 --> 15:12.070
One bottle of vodka.

15:13.939 --> 15:15.774
Come on, let's go.

15:16.775 --> 15:19.377
*

15:19.411 --> 15:22.380
-I'm not asking for
a complete security manifest.
-(sighs)

15:22.414 --> 15:24.617
I'm just... curious
what you know about her.

15:24.650 --> 15:27.686
I don't know anything-- I met
her yesterday, just like you.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.222
Yeah, but... you have to clear
all incoming personnel,

15:30.255 --> 15:32.357
so you see all the files.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.592
May I join you?

15:33.626 --> 15:34.793
Sure. Have a seat.

15:34.827 --> 15:36.729
Okay. Did she say anything

15:36.762 --> 15:38.597
that had the word
"boyfriend" in it?

15:38.631 --> 15:40.599
(laughs): No.
She literally just talked

15:40.633 --> 15:43.602
about how excited she was
to be on the Orville. That's it.

15:43.636 --> 15:46.872
-What is the problem?
-Gordon has a crush
on the new cartographer.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.473
I don't have a crush,
for God's sakes.

15:48.506 --> 15:50.809
I... just want to know
what her deal is, you know?

15:50.843 --> 15:53.879
And I thought maybe
I would see if she wanted to go

15:53.912 --> 15:56.481
-to Bortus's Ja'loja party.
-Well, then ask her.

15:56.514 --> 15:58.116
Well, how do you think
I should do that?

15:58.150 --> 16:00.052
-"Hey, I'm Gordon.
You like pee?"
-Please, I am

16:00.085 --> 16:02.287
the last person you should
be asking for dating advice.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.623
You know what kind of luck
I've had on this ship.

16:04.657 --> 16:06.124
Maybe you should ask John?

16:06.158 --> 16:07.660
This is more his department.

16:10.495 --> 16:12.731
John, I need to talk to you.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.099
Yeah, what's up?

16:14.132 --> 16:17.102
It's... sort of private.

16:21.506 --> 16:23.742
-Okay, so what is it?
-I need your guidance.

16:23.776 --> 16:26.078
You know the new
cartographer, Janel?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.813
I sure do.
How could you miss her?

16:27.846 --> 16:30.282
I want to ask her to be my date
to Bortus's Ja'loja,

16:30.315 --> 16:32.951
but I have, like, zero game,
and I know you're kind of, like,

16:32.985 --> 16:34.953
the girl guru on the ship, so...

16:34.987 --> 16:36.488
-I figured you could help me.
-Uh...

16:36.521 --> 16:38.824
-you must've heard
about the Keribex.
-The what?

16:38.857 --> 16:40.125
That's why everybody thinks
I'm the guru.

16:40.158 --> 16:41.359
You ever met a Keribex?

16:41.393 --> 16:43.461
-No.
-It's an alien with two heads.

16:43.495 --> 16:46.198
I dated one for about two months
last year, and here's the thing:

16:46.231 --> 16:47.833
I dated both heads
at the same time,

16:47.866 --> 16:49.835
and neither of them found out
about the other one.

16:49.868 --> 16:51.937
-Wow.
-Yeah, it'd still be going on,

16:51.970 --> 16:53.872
but the left head
always wanted to go hiking,

16:53.906 --> 16:56.008
and that's just sort of
a deal-breaker for me.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.110
Well, Janel only has one head.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.912
Yeah, I can help you.

17:05.884 --> 17:08.854
Now, the star itself has
a number of planets and moons

17:08.887 --> 17:13.525
in its orbit, but which one
of them caused the dispute

17:13.558 --> 17:16.661
that led
to the Battle of Tarazed?

17:16.695 --> 17:18.697
Anyone?

17:18.731 --> 17:21.399
James. Which planet?

17:21.433 --> 17:23.969
-I don't know.
-It was in your reading
last night.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.904
-Did you do your homework?
-Yeah, but...

17:25.938 --> 17:29.574
-Commander Bortus ate it, so...
-(children laughing)

17:29.607 --> 17:31.143
Marcus.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.678
Maybe you'd like to answer
that question.

17:33.712 --> 17:35.914
(chuckles softly)
I don't know, either.

17:35.948 --> 17:38.550
Did Bortus eat
your homework, too?

17:38.583 --> 17:42.520
Well, the Moclan digestive
system is indeed fascinating,

17:42.554 --> 17:44.656
so for tomorrow, James, Marcus,
each of you can write

17:44.689 --> 17:46.759
a 1,000-word essay
on its internal mechanisms

17:46.792 --> 17:48.927
and how they function.

17:48.961 --> 17:50.395
Class dismissed.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.399
Hey.

17:54.432 --> 17:56.001
-Hi.
-How you doing?

17:56.034 --> 17:57.770
Mm. Better than you, apparently.

17:57.803 --> 17:59.504
Man, those kids are rough.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.740
Yeah, I've seen a lot worse.
You know, I expect it

18:01.774 --> 18:03.175
from James,
but I'm a little concerned

18:03.208 --> 18:04.709
Marcus is
getting caught up in it.

18:04.743 --> 18:05.844
He's a good kid.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.179
Well, he has a great mom

18:07.212 --> 18:08.446
and a really great teacher.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.415
-Hmm.
-So I'm not too worried.

18:10.448 --> 18:13.051
-We still doing dinner tonight?
-You bet.

18:13.085 --> 18:15.520
And... there's something
I want to ask you.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.589
-What?
-I'll tell you at dinner.

18:17.622 --> 18:20.058
Oh, no, no.
Come on, you can't do that.

18:20.092 --> 18:22.594
-It'll keep you in suspense.
-Just tell me.

18:22.627 --> 18:24.062
If you're
charming enough tonight.

18:24.096 --> 18:25.730
-I'm always charming.
-Good.

18:25.764 --> 18:28.300
-Then you'll get to hear it.
-(scoffs)

18:34.172 --> 18:36.174
(sighs)

18:46.584 --> 18:48.053
Lieutenant.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.988
I'm gonna take a shuttle out--

18:50.022 --> 18:51.623
I'll be back in a little bit.

18:51.656 --> 18:54.092
Okay, sir. Do you want me
to assign a copilot?

18:54.126 --> 18:55.961
No. I'm just gonna go
for a drive.

18:55.994 --> 18:57.295
Yes, sir.

19:04.803 --> 19:08.506
Commander, I have the status
report on the weapons upgrade.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.642
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Uh, Lieutenant.

19:10.675 --> 19:12.677
Yeah?

19:12.710 --> 19:16.148
I could not help overhearing
you discuss your complaint

19:16.181 --> 19:18.416
-in the mess hall.
-Complaint?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.752
I am led to understand
that you are a failure

19:20.785 --> 19:22.754
in the practice of mating.

19:22.787 --> 19:26.491
(laughs): Well, I don't think
I'd put it exactly like that,

19:26.524 --> 19:29.761
but yeah,
things could be better.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.964
There is a young officer
under my command

19:31.997 --> 19:34.799
who I have noticed
also has no mate.

19:34.833 --> 19:37.369
If you wish, I will order him
to mate with you.

19:37.402 --> 19:40.973
Wow, that is the sweetest
and most totally wrong thing

19:41.006 --> 19:42.807
anyone has ever said to me.

19:42.841 --> 19:45.210
I have no reason to doubt
his seed is fertile.

19:45.243 --> 19:46.611
Okay. Let's just slow down.

19:46.644 --> 19:50.782
Bortus, are you trying
to fix me up on a date?

19:50.815 --> 19:56.388
It is bad luck to attend
a Ja'loja unaccompanied.

19:56.421 --> 20:00.058
Well, we wouldn't want to invite
any bad luck, would we?

20:00.092 --> 20:02.294
-Then you will accept him?
-Well, don't order him

20:02.327 --> 20:05.297
to do anything, but if you want
to let him know

20:05.330 --> 20:07.699
that I'm up
for meeting him, sure.

20:07.732 --> 20:10.202
Only because I'm totally
and completely fascinated

20:10.235 --> 20:12.337
by what's happening here
right now.

20:12.370 --> 20:14.139
Who would've thought
you were a yenta?

20:14.172 --> 20:16.774
-A what?
-Ask Kelly.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.544
(door whooshes open)

20:23.115 --> 20:25.250
Okay.

20:25.283 --> 20:27.352
Out with it. No more suspense.

20:27.385 --> 20:30.388
Mm. Okay, well...

20:30.422 --> 20:33.725
I think...

20:33.758 --> 20:35.727
I would like it a lot
if you came with me

20:35.760 --> 20:37.162
to Bortus's Ja'loja.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.431
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:39.464 --> 20:41.399
That's going public.

20:41.433 --> 20:44.336
-It's going public, yes.
-Well, what about Ed?

20:44.369 --> 20:47.839
-I told him I'm seeing someone.
-Does he know that it's me?

20:47.872 --> 20:49.942
No, but he knows I'm gonna
have a date to the party.

20:49.975 --> 20:51.776
(sighs)

20:51.809 --> 20:54.346
Guys are weird, Kel.
The first time you see your ex

20:54.379 --> 20:57.049
with another man,
it can be pretty debilitating.

20:57.082 --> 20:59.684
Well, he's gonna have to get
used to it eventually.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.553
And yes, Ed can be
an intense guy.

21:01.586 --> 21:03.555
-(chuckles softly)
-But he also,
at the end of the day,

21:03.588 --> 21:06.024
is very capable of adapting
to new situations.

21:06.058 --> 21:07.892
I mean, he may balk at first,

21:07.926 --> 21:12.130
but he's gonna at least want
to appear to be classy about it.

21:12.164 --> 21:13.865
All right.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.467
You got yourself a date.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.469
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:29.781 --> 21:32.317
(groaning):
Oh, no way.

21:37.655 --> 21:39.457
What's wrong?

21:39.491 --> 21:42.294
What do you say we take that
bottle of wine to the simulator?

21:42.327 --> 21:44.296
Fire up a little moonlight
on the beach?

21:44.329 --> 21:46.798
-Sounds good to me.
-Let's go.

21:49.601 --> 21:50.969
(door whooshes open)

21:51.003 --> 21:53.005
(laughter)

21:58.176 --> 22:00.945
Oh, man.

22:17.362 --> 22:18.530
What's the big deal?

22:18.563 --> 22:20.365
It was just a little vodka.

22:20.398 --> 22:22.367
First of all,
I will ask the questions,

22:22.400 --> 22:25.203
and you will answer the
questions. Do you understand?

22:26.238 --> 22:29.207
Do you understand?

22:29.241 --> 22:30.975
-Yes.
-And second of all,

22:31.009 --> 22:33.511
it is a very big deal.
Not just because you drank,

22:33.545 --> 22:36.781
but because you...
Ty, uh, go back to your room.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.816
But I want to watch Marcus
get yelled at.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.019
-Now, Ty.
-(clicks tongue) Aw.

22:42.987 --> 22:46.291
You hacked a food synthesizer.
You're in a lot of trouble.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.826
James is the one who hacked it.
I didn't even touch it.

22:48.860 --> 22:51.196
Oh, your new best friend James?
That James?

22:51.229 --> 22:53.031
Well, you're not gonna be
hanging out with him anymore,

22:53.065 --> 22:54.466
I can tell you that.

22:54.499 --> 22:57.202
-Oh, come on, Mom.
-Marcus.

22:57.235 --> 22:59.471
If anything else
that does not reek of contrition

22:59.504 --> 23:01.073
comes out of that mouth,

23:01.106 --> 23:03.041
you will be grounded
for the rest of your life.

23:03.075 --> 23:04.376
You understand?

23:06.611 --> 23:08.646
Look.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.915
All I want to know
is where this is coming from.

23:10.948 --> 23:13.051
You haven't been
yourself at all lately,

23:13.085 --> 23:15.720
and you're acting like
you hate the universe.

23:15.753 --> 23:17.955
Now, I'm pissed as hell at you,
but I love you.

23:20.192 --> 23:22.360
I-I...

23:23.961 --> 23:26.598
I just want you to talk to me.

23:33.771 --> 23:36.641
All right. Go to your room.

23:41.613 --> 23:44.349
(door whooshes open, shut)

23:44.382 --> 23:47.385
I'm starting to think that
I suck at this parenting thing.

23:47.419 --> 23:49.387
I must agree
with that assessment.

23:49.421 --> 23:51.123
Well, what would you have done?

23:51.156 --> 23:53.391
My anthropological studies
have revealed

23:53.425 --> 23:55.260
many different methods
of discipline

23:55.293 --> 23:57.362
employed throughout
human history.

23:57.395 --> 24:01.266
Perhaps compulsory consumption
of further quantities of alcohol

24:01.299 --> 24:03.468
would diminish his desire
for the substance.

24:03.501 --> 24:07.139
Pour booze down his throat
until he can't handle any more?

24:07.172 --> 24:09.707
-Precisely.
-Yeah, that's called murder,
Isaac.

24:09.741 --> 24:12.744
-That's not gonna work.
-I see.

24:12.777 --> 24:16.581
I thank you for allowing me to
observe this conflict, Doctor.

24:16.614 --> 24:18.983
It has been most illuminating.

24:19.016 --> 24:20.785
Oh.

24:20.818 --> 24:22.620
-Always here to entertain.
-(door whooshes open)

24:29.527 --> 24:32.130
Yeah. Yep.

24:35.032 --> 24:37.935
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.
That's good.

24:37.969 --> 24:39.504
Yeah, you look like the guy
who's on the list

24:39.537 --> 24:41.239
-'cause you know the DJ.
-Does it work?

24:41.273 --> 24:42.407
It does, yeah.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.142
Feels like too many zippers.

24:44.176 --> 24:45.643
Oh, no, no. Always go
with one more zipper

24:45.677 --> 24:46.844
than you're comfortable with.

24:46.878 --> 24:48.646
-Oh.
-You know what it says?

24:48.680 --> 24:50.315
-What?
-"Boom."

24:50.348 --> 24:51.483
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:51.516 --> 24:52.817
Cool.

24:52.850 --> 24:54.252
And that's where
you want to start.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.953
You want to walk in with boom.

24:55.987 --> 24:58.190
-Boom.
-Yeah, yeah, not like that,
but yeah.

24:58.223 --> 25:00.325
-Right.
-Just let the threads
do the work.

25:00.358 --> 25:01.626
Yeah, you're just a passenger,
kicking back,

25:01.659 --> 25:02.860
along for the ride.

25:02.894 --> 25:04.929
Just a guy riding a jacket.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.798
-You feel good?
-Yeah, I do. I do.

25:06.831 --> 25:08.866
I'm still nervous, but yeah.

25:08.900 --> 25:11.669
Why you nervous? You're a good
looking dude, you're funny.

25:11.703 --> 25:14.206
-Just be yourself.
-Well, I've just...

25:14.239 --> 25:17.675
You know, I've-I've only ever
been with women who liked me.

25:17.709 --> 25:19.277
You know?
Never the other way around.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.546
I mean, I'd ask girls out
and get rejected,

25:21.579 --> 25:24.616
but if she made the first move,
we'd end up dating.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.018
-Ah, I get it.
-This is a perfect example:

25:27.051 --> 25:29.487
when I lived on Earth,
I actually once had a stalker.

25:29.521 --> 25:31.489
-No way.
-Yeah, this girl from work.

25:31.523 --> 25:32.957
She used to hang around
outside my house

25:32.990 --> 25:34.559
and it got really weird.

25:34.592 --> 25:36.361
Then one night, she broke in,

25:36.394 --> 25:38.630
and I told her I was gonna
have to call Union security.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.365
But we ended up talking.

25:40.398 --> 25:42.367
Turned out, we actually had
a lot in common.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.835
We ended up seeing each other
for five months,

25:43.868 --> 25:45.303
and then she dumped me.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.372
-What?
-Said I was too clingy.

25:47.405 --> 25:49.073
You got dumped
by your own stalker?

25:49.106 --> 25:50.508
That's nuts, huh?

25:50.542 --> 25:52.143
You think I should call her?

25:52.176 --> 25:54.512
Yeah, I think we need,
like, one more zipper.

26:00.852 --> 26:02.254
DANN:
Hey.

26:02.287 --> 26:04.289
Hey.

26:07.925 --> 26:09.894
Can I help you?

26:09.927 --> 26:12.864
-I'm Dann.
-I know.

26:12.897 --> 26:16.033
-You're Alara.
-Right again.

26:17.869 --> 26:20.272
(laughs):
Wait, did...

26:20.305 --> 26:22.740
did-did Bortus send you?

26:22.774 --> 26:24.276
Yeah. Can I sit down?

26:24.309 --> 26:25.543
-Oh, my God.
-(exhales)

26:27.579 --> 26:30.515
-He thinks we'd be a good match.
-I don't believe it.

26:30.548 --> 26:32.750
I wonder what kinds of things
we have in common.

26:32.784 --> 26:37.522
Um, well, uh, we obviously
both know Bortus.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.557
(laughs)
Well, there's one.

26:39.591 --> 26:41.092
-Ha.
-So, uh,

26:41.125 --> 26:42.694
want to get a drink sometime?

26:42.727 --> 26:46.898
Look, Dann,
I'll be honest with you.

26:46.931 --> 26:48.533
I'm not so great

26:48.566 --> 26:50.902
at the whole dating thing,
and I don't think

26:50.935 --> 26:53.705
we're as good of a match
as Bortus thinks we are.

26:53.738 --> 26:56.073
Well, I guess you never know
until you try.

26:56.107 --> 26:57.742
Yeah, but I-I...

26:57.775 --> 27:00.412
It's my big old stupid
dumb head, isn't it?

27:00.445 --> 27:02.714
No. No, it has nothing
to do with that, it's...

27:02.747 --> 27:04.215
You don't have to be nice.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.750
My species has a hard time

27:05.783 --> 27:07.952
meeting people
outside our home planet.

27:07.985 --> 27:11.222
We're just not
super appealing, I guess.

27:11.255 --> 27:15.927
But sometimes a person
can be special on the inside,

27:15.960 --> 27:18.330
and if you don't look
under the surface,

27:18.363 --> 27:20.332
you could miss something great.

27:20.365 --> 27:24.602
And possibly be single
the rest of your life.

27:24.636 --> 27:26.604
Or at least
for Bortus's Ja'loja.

27:26.638 --> 27:29.607
Okay. All right, you know, what
the hell?

27:29.641 --> 27:31.275
Let's do drinks.

27:31.309 --> 27:33.277
Sweetness.

27:33.311 --> 27:34.479
(door chimes)

27:34.512 --> 27:36.514
Come in.

27:38.182 --> 27:39.851
Hey.

27:39.884 --> 27:43.154
Did you take
a shuttle out last night?

27:43.187 --> 27:45.457
Uh, no.

27:45.490 --> 27:49.260
The shuttle bay log
says you did.

27:49.293 --> 27:51.429
(laughing):
Oh.

27:51.463 --> 27:52.830
Gordon.

27:52.864 --> 27:54.966
-Ha. What about Gordon?
-(chuckles): We...

27:54.999 --> 27:56.634
we have this running bit
that we do where we put

27:56.668 --> 27:58.202
each other's names
in the shuttle log

27:58.235 --> 27:59.637
when we didn't actually
take a shuttle out.

27:59.671 --> 28:01.673
And then when
the other one finds out,

28:01.706 --> 28:03.508
it's just like,
"Oh, my God. Embarrassing.

28:03.541 --> 28:06.444
I didn't take that shuttle. Ah."

28:06.478 --> 28:08.713
(laughs softly)

28:08.746 --> 28:11.015
It's... it's-it's that.

28:11.048 --> 28:12.717
-You did a drive-by.
-Huh?

28:12.750 --> 28:14.018
Don't deny it. I saw you.

28:14.051 --> 28:15.653
I did not do a drive-by.

28:15.687 --> 28:17.121
-That's insane.
-Your name

28:17.154 --> 28:18.623
is in the log,
and you did a drive-by.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.224
I had to get some air.

28:20.257 --> 28:21.726
We're in space.

28:21.759 --> 28:24.128
Did you see
what you needed to see?

28:24.161 --> 28:26.664
-Cassius. Really?
-Oh my God, I knew it.

28:26.698 --> 28:28.332
Is it-is it "Cassius,"
or is it "Cass-ius"?

28:28.366 --> 28:30.402
-It's Cassius.
-Ca-- Okay,
so you're dating Cass-ius.

28:30.435 --> 28:32.003
-Yes. Yes, I am.
-Okay.

28:35.573 --> 28:38.376
-Go ahead, say it.
-Say what?

28:38.410 --> 28:40.378
Whatever snarky jab
you were about to make.

28:41.913 --> 28:44.882
I saw him in the mess hall
using both hands to sip his tea.

28:44.916 --> 28:47.084
Okay, here's what's
gonna have to happen.

28:47.118 --> 28:49.253
We're all living and working
on the same ship together.

28:49.286 --> 28:51.022
So you're going to have
to somehow find a way

28:51.055 --> 28:53.224
to make peace with this because
if what happened last night

28:53.257 --> 28:55.693
ever happens again,
I'm going to request a transfer.

28:55.727 --> 28:57.261
Gosh, you know,
I'm really impressed

28:57.294 --> 29:00.264
that you can adjust your
feelings like a knob on a radio,

29:00.297 --> 29:01.733
-but I can't do that.
-You think moving on

29:01.766 --> 29:03.868
was any easier for me
than it was for you?

29:03.901 --> 29:06.170
Apparently, since you're the one
dating the "two hand tea" man.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.105
We've been over this.
We cannot be together.

29:08.139 --> 29:10.575
I still love you. Okay?
Do you still love me?

29:10.608 --> 29:11.609
It's not that simple.

29:11.643 --> 29:13.578
Yes, it is.
Kelly, it is that simple.

29:13.611 --> 29:15.880
If two people love each other,
it is exactly that simple.

29:15.913 --> 29:17.248
A captain and his first officer

29:17.281 --> 29:18.616
cannot be in
a relationship together.

29:18.650 --> 29:20.084
For God's sake, Ed,
you know that.

29:20.117 --> 29:21.285
Do you love me?

29:23.387 --> 29:25.222
How I feel is not the issue.

29:25.256 --> 29:28.259
Okay, then.

29:28.292 --> 29:30.462
Have fun with Cass-ius.

29:30.495 --> 29:31.896
You know,

29:31.929 --> 29:33.931
if you got to know him,
believe it or not,

29:33.965 --> 29:35.433
I-I think you'd
actually like him.

29:35.467 --> 29:37.001
I doubt it.

29:38.670 --> 29:42.507
I have a bunch of work
I have to do, so...

29:49.180 --> 29:51.182
(sighs)

30:05.630 --> 30:08.500
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

30:08.533 --> 30:09.934
(door whooshes open)

30:09.967 --> 30:11.503
Hi.

30:11.536 --> 30:13.170
Can I help you?

30:13.204 --> 30:14.906
Hi, Dr. Finn. I'm Jody Duncan.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.307
This is my husband, Nathan.

30:16.340 --> 30:17.742
We're James's parents.

30:17.775 --> 30:20.311
Oh. Nice to meet you.

30:20.344 --> 30:23.080
Well, I wish it were under
more ideal circumstances.

30:23.114 --> 30:27.251
We wanted to talk to you about
what happened, with the alcohol.

30:27.284 --> 30:29.286
Yeah, I know this
is uncomfortable for all of us,

30:29.320 --> 30:31.689
but I just think,
given the circumstances,

30:31.723 --> 30:35.326
that it's best if Marcus doesn't
spend time with James right now.

30:35.359 --> 30:37.762
Well, of course
we agree with you,

30:37.795 --> 30:40.965
but, um, we feel
it's more serious than that.

30:40.998 --> 30:43.334
Well, he is your son,

30:43.367 --> 30:46.638
but if you're here asking
for my professional advice,

30:46.671 --> 30:48.339
-I think maybe talking...
-Uh, no.

30:48.372 --> 30:51.609
This isn't about our son.
This is about Marcus.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.045
What about Marcus?

30:54.078 --> 30:56.380
Marcus was the one
who hacked the synthesizer.

30:56.413 --> 30:57.815
You do know that, right?

30:57.849 --> 30:59.651
No, I don't.

30:59.684 --> 31:02.554
Oh. It was his idea
to steal the vodka.

31:02.587 --> 31:04.188
Now, James shouldn't have gone
along with it,

31:04.221 --> 31:05.823
and we will be punishing him,

31:05.857 --> 31:08.459
but we just don't think Marcus
is someone James should be

31:08.492 --> 31:10.728
spending time with right now,
all due respect to you.

31:10.762 --> 31:12.196
NATHAN:
We're gonna request that Marcus

31:12.229 --> 31:13.731
be transferred from the class.

31:13.765 --> 31:15.399
We just wanted
to let you know first,

31:15.432 --> 31:18.235
out of courtesy.

31:18.269 --> 31:19.871
Are you on drugs?

31:19.904 --> 31:21.338
Excuse me?

31:21.372 --> 31:23.240
James was the ringleader,
not Marcus.

31:23.274 --> 31:26.644
That's ridiculous.
James told us what happened.

31:26.678 --> 31:29.246
(chuckles) Yeah, well,
Marcus tells a different story.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.715
Our son doesn't lie.

31:30.748 --> 31:33.585
-How well do you know your son?
-What does that mean?

31:33.618 --> 31:35.820
He called me a "pain in the ass"
the other day.

31:35.853 --> 31:37.088
JODY:
That is insane.

31:37.121 --> 31:38.656
There is no way
James would say that.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.224
Now, he is a very independent,

31:40.257 --> 31:43.761
strong-minded young man,
but he is always respectful.

31:43.795 --> 31:45.396
Respectful, my butt.

31:45.429 --> 31:48.199
Dr. Finn...

31:48.232 --> 31:50.034
I have great admiration for you.

31:50.067 --> 31:51.669
Being a single mother
is challenging,

31:51.703 --> 31:53.337
and I am sure that
it's easy to make mistakes.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.939
Regardless,

31:54.972 --> 31:57.008
we will be scheduling
a parent-teacher conference.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.610
You are more than welcome
to join.

31:58.643 --> 32:00.377
Count on it.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.088
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

32:11.122 --> 32:12.757
What do you mean, what?
"We've all been there"?

32:12.790 --> 32:14.191
That's your response?

32:14.225 --> 32:16.260
I don't know. Haven't you ever
done a drive-by?

32:16.293 --> 32:17.561
No. Have you?

32:17.595 --> 32:20.632
I might've, once or twice.

32:20.665 --> 32:23.034
My God, every man in the galaxy
is a psychopath.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.401
Look, he's hurt.

32:24.435 --> 32:26.738
It sucks. We all can relate
to it. He acted rashly,

32:26.771 --> 32:29.040
but I think it's okay for us
to be understanding.

32:29.073 --> 32:31.408
-Do you always have to do that?
-Do what?

32:31.442 --> 32:33.410
Be so... evolved?

32:33.444 --> 32:36.247
I just don't understand
why you're upset with me.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.782
Honestly? Because your
"high road" attitude

32:37.815 --> 32:39.216
is making me feel
like I'm overreacting,

32:39.250 --> 32:41.085
when I know for a fact
that I'm right.

32:41.118 --> 32:42.620
Do you want me to be jealous?

32:42.654 --> 32:46.123
No. I mean, I don't know.

32:46.157 --> 32:47.959
Yeah. Yes, maybe a little.

32:47.992 --> 32:49.426
I don't see how
that's productive.

32:49.460 --> 32:50.628
Cassius,

32:50.662 --> 32:52.630
this is not your classroom.

32:52.664 --> 32:54.165
I am your girlfriend,
and right now,

32:54.198 --> 32:56.067
I'm feeling completely
disconnected from you.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.336
I am not going to be angry
with Ed if I don't feel it.

32:59.370 --> 33:01.639
Look, if you just calm down
a little, there's no reason...

33:01.673 --> 33:03.908
-Oh, man.
-What?

33:03.941 --> 33:06.210
Never mind.

33:16.553 --> 33:19.490
Program Lamarr 3594.

33:19.523 --> 33:23.027
(crowd chatter, music playing)

33:23.060 --> 33:25.697
Okay, here we go.
Begin simulation.

33:27.498 --> 33:31.235
Be yourself, go over there,
and ask her out.

33:35.973 --> 33:37.174
Hi, there.

33:39.210 --> 33:40.377
Hi.

33:40.411 --> 33:42.046
I'm Gordon. What's your name?

33:42.079 --> 33:43.180
Danielle.

33:43.214 --> 33:45.783
Hi, Danielle, I'm Gordon.

33:45.817 --> 33:47.484
Want to go back to my place?

33:47.518 --> 33:48.853
Whoa, whoa, hang on. Hold.

33:48.886 --> 33:51.689
Uh, what's the difficulty level?

33:51.723 --> 33:53.190
COMPUTER:
Difficulty level: one.

33:53.224 --> 33:54.658
Ah, there's the problem.

33:54.692 --> 33:56.994
Reset difficulty level to eight.

33:57.028 --> 33:58.796
COMPUTER:
Resetting.

33:58.830 --> 33:59.897
Okay, go.

34:01.866 --> 34:03.034
Hey there.

34:03.067 --> 34:05.302
Oh, God, not another one.

34:05.336 --> 34:07.404
My name's Gordon.
Mind if I sit down?

34:07.438 --> 34:09.841
Listen, guy, I have been hit on
by four different dudes

34:09.874 --> 34:11.242
from four different
species tonight.

34:11.275 --> 34:13.244
One of them had his organs
on the outside.

34:13.277 --> 34:16.347
My boyfriend just dumped me, and
all I want to do is drink alone.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.750
Well, then...
why'd you come out?

34:18.783 --> 34:21.018
I like the noise.

34:21.052 --> 34:23.554
Well... if you just
want to talk and...

34:23.587 --> 34:24.555
I don't.

34:24.588 --> 34:25.656
Okay, this is level eight.

34:25.689 --> 34:26.858
What's level nine?

34:26.891 --> 34:28.492
Level nine,
she's still dating the guy.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.862
-And level ten?
-She's married and has a gun.

34:30.895 --> 34:32.196
So what do I do?

34:32.229 --> 34:34.565
Just be creative, be charming.
Figure it out.

34:37.068 --> 34:38.369
(sighs)

34:38.402 --> 34:40.872
I have six months left to live,

34:40.905 --> 34:43.875
and all I want to do
is get to know you before I die.

34:43.908 --> 34:46.610
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

34:46.643 --> 34:48.946
-You're dying?
-So totally dying,
it's ridiculous.

34:48.980 --> 34:50.915
Nobody's dying more than me.

34:50.948 --> 34:53.918
This is probably my last night
out, ever, 'cause I'm dying.

34:53.951 --> 34:55.419
Well, I guess I'd be a jerk

34:55.452 --> 34:57.454
if I didn't at least
let you get me a drink.

34:57.488 --> 34:59.056
Boom! There it is.
Hold simulation.

34:59.090 --> 35:02.693
-I can't tell Janel I'm dying.
-That's not the point.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.929
The point is, you're thinking on
your feet, you're improvising.

35:04.962 --> 35:07.965
-That's what it's all about.
-Okay.

35:07.999 --> 35:09.266
I think you're ready.

35:17.174 --> 35:19.443
-Hello, Doctor.
-Isaac,

35:19.476 --> 35:22.246
-do you think I'm a bad parent?
-Yes.

35:22.279 --> 35:25.917
(scoffs)
Well, a computer doesn't lie.

35:25.950 --> 35:28.119
You appear displeased.

35:29.353 --> 35:31.989
James's parents
are accusing Marcus

35:32.023 --> 35:35.426
of hacking the food synthesizer,
and I have to ask myself:

35:35.459 --> 35:37.494
Is it possible they're right?

35:37.528 --> 35:40.664
Did I go wrong somewhere
along the line with my son?

35:40.697 --> 35:42.967
Parenting is always guesswork,

35:43.000 --> 35:45.102
but have I made
too many bad guesses?

35:45.136 --> 35:47.004
What do you intend to do?

35:47.038 --> 35:50.307
They want a parent-teacher
meeting to decide the issue.

35:50.341 --> 35:53.978
I would be most interested
in observing such a ritual.

35:54.011 --> 35:56.147
May I accompany you?

35:57.381 --> 35:59.851
-You'd come with me?
-Yes.

35:59.884 --> 36:03.120
Well, then it won't be
two against one.

36:03.154 --> 36:04.621
"Two against one."

36:04.655 --> 36:07.091
Do you anticipate
hand-to-hand combat?

36:07.124 --> 36:09.526
(chuckles) Possibly.

36:18.135 --> 36:20.504
(light piano music plays)

36:20.537 --> 36:22.907
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

36:28.579 --> 36:31.448
Hey there, Lieutenant. I hope
you're not getting stood up.

36:31.482 --> 36:33.350
-No, I'm actually just early.
-Would you like me to get you

36:33.384 --> 36:35.686
a little boozer or something
while you're waiting?

36:35.719 --> 36:37.221
It's okay. Thanks, Mooska.

36:37.254 --> 36:39.556
You got it.

36:41.825 --> 36:42.826
Hey, hey.

36:42.860 --> 36:45.362
Hey, hey, there. How's it going?

36:45.396 --> 36:49.133
Amazing. I got a massage today.
I feel like a noodle.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.301
Cool.

36:50.334 --> 36:51.869
(sighs) Listen.

36:51.903 --> 36:55.139
I... I felt like we really
connected when we met,

36:55.172 --> 36:57.641
and, uh...

36:57.674 --> 36:59.310
I, uh...

36:59.343 --> 37:01.512
Wow, a little-little
more nervous

37:01.545 --> 37:02.846
than I thought. (chuckles)

37:02.880 --> 37:04.916
What is it?

37:04.949 --> 37:07.151
-I wrote a poem.
-A poem.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.986
I write poetry as a hobby,

37:09.020 --> 37:12.189
and I felt inspired.
Okay, you ready?

37:12.223 --> 37:13.557
(Dann clears throat)

37:13.590 --> 37:17.728
"Yearning. Passion. Search.

37:17.761 --> 37:20.497
"Who will feed the coals of joy

37:20.531 --> 37:23.100
"in the stove of emotion?

37:23.134 --> 37:25.169
My fingers ache
to penetrate the hearth..."

37:25.202 --> 37:28.205
-(chuckles nervously)
-"Love is the fishhook

37:28.239 --> 37:32.243
that hooks the fish."
What do you think?

37:32.276 --> 37:34.912
-It's really good.
-Be brutally honest.

37:34.946 --> 37:37.881
I need absolute honesty
or I can't grow as an artist.

37:37.915 --> 37:39.216
No, it's-it's great.

37:39.250 --> 37:42.619
You won't offend me,
just tell me the truth.

37:42.653 --> 37:45.722
W-Well, um...

37:45.756 --> 37:48.592
It's maybe a little surface-y.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.261
Oh.

37:50.294 --> 37:52.896
Like, i-i-it doesn't ask
anything of the listener.

37:52.930 --> 37:55.866
The imagery's a little obvious,
so there's nothing to unearth.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.802
And there's no room
for subjective interpretation.

37:58.835 --> 38:01.305
Okay.

38:01.338 --> 38:04.041
Boy, got a little chilly in here
all of a sudden, didn't it?

38:04.075 --> 38:06.143
You said to be honest.

38:06.177 --> 38:08.812
Yeah, well, I didn't say
take a dump all over my spirit.

38:08.845 --> 38:10.047
I didn't say that.

38:10.081 --> 38:13.317
I'm just...

38:13.350 --> 38:16.220
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

38:16.253 --> 38:17.754
(sighs)

38:19.190 --> 38:21.258
(sighs, chuckles softly)

38:21.292 --> 38:23.027
(comscanner beeps)

38:29.000 --> 38:30.467
(exhales)

38:31.868 --> 38:33.804
(sighs)

38:36.507 --> 38:37.841
(chimes)

38:37.874 --> 38:39.276
CASSIUS:
Come in.

38:41.345 --> 38:43.414
-Captain. Hi.
-No, you don't have to get up.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.150
No, no, it's fine.
Can I get you a drink?

38:46.183 --> 38:48.619
Yeah. Actually,
a drink would be good.

38:52.723 --> 38:53.857
So...

38:53.890 --> 38:56.360
-what can I do for you?
-Well, I...

38:56.393 --> 38:59.130
owe you an apology.

38:59.163 --> 39:01.532
Apology? For what?

39:01.565 --> 39:03.200
(chuckles):
That's nice of you to say,

39:03.234 --> 39:04.868
but I think we both know what.

39:06.170 --> 39:07.304
Listen, Cass-ius...

39:07.338 --> 39:08.839
-Cassius.
-Damn.

39:08.872 --> 39:10.207
Um...

39:10.241 --> 39:12.476
look, this is a small ship,

39:12.509 --> 39:13.610
and...

39:13.644 --> 39:15.612
it's just gonna take me a minute

39:15.646 --> 39:17.848
to adjust to this new reality.

39:17.881 --> 39:19.450
Well, trust me,
your learning curve

39:19.483 --> 39:20.984
is nothing compared to mine.

39:21.018 --> 39:22.019
What do you mean?

39:22.053 --> 39:23.854
(sighs):
Kelly and I had a fight,

39:23.887 --> 39:26.623
she walked out on me--
and I am so sorry, this is

39:26.657 --> 39:28.559
probably the last thing
that you want to hear.

39:28.592 --> 39:30.927
Well, nobody fights better
than Kelly, huh?

39:32.729 --> 39:35.866
I've just, I've been independent
for so long that I think the way

39:35.899 --> 39:38.569
I think, and I sometimes forget
that another person's involved.

39:38.602 --> 39:40.837
Were you ever married?

39:40.871 --> 39:42.839
(sighs):
Yeah. Yeah, I was...

39:42.873 --> 39:45.309
an aspiring paleontologist--
I wanted to be the one

39:45.342 --> 39:47.478
to discover
the next unclassified species,

39:47.511 --> 39:49.080
make a name for myself.

39:49.113 --> 39:51.182
And my work drove me to succeed,

39:51.215 --> 39:54.551
but it also drove a stake
right through my marriage.

39:54.585 --> 39:57.554
My God, she definitely has
a type, doesn't she?

39:57.588 --> 39:58.822
Huh?

39:58.855 --> 40:01.092
Do you love her?

40:01.125 --> 40:02.526
I do.

40:02.559 --> 40:04.027
Very much.

40:06.430 --> 40:07.998
What, um...

40:08.031 --> 40:11.001
what was it you said
that made her walk out?

40:11.034 --> 40:14.071
(sighs): Ah, well, I...
I was actually defending you,

40:14.105 --> 40:16.507
and she said that
I was being "too evolved,"

40:16.540 --> 40:18.609
and I told her
to calm down, and...

40:18.642 --> 40:21.011
Ooh. Ooh,
you didn't say "calm down."

40:21.044 --> 40:23.714
-I-I did.
-Oh, boy. Yeah, that's, um...

40:23.747 --> 40:25.349
Oh, well, I was just trying
to see things reasonably

40:25.382 --> 40:26.383
-from all sides.
-And that's great,

40:26.417 --> 40:27.584
and I appreciate that.

40:27.618 --> 40:29.253
It's just...

40:29.286 --> 40:31.288
Here's my theory.

40:31.322 --> 40:35.426
A woman can't really love a man
unless he's part dope.

40:35.459 --> 40:38.129
Be a little stupid every day,

40:38.162 --> 40:40.231
and really stupid
once in a while, but...

40:40.264 --> 40:41.598
just don't be perfect.

40:41.632 --> 40:43.700
That's not easy.

40:43.734 --> 40:45.636
(takes deep breath)

40:46.637 --> 40:48.139
Journey.

40:48.172 --> 40:50.207
What?

40:50.241 --> 40:51.642
She likes Journey.

40:51.675 --> 40:53.877
-Traveling?
-No, no, the old band, Journey.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.146
You'll find them
in the archives.

40:55.179 --> 40:56.447
Look, just get some Merlot,

40:56.480 --> 40:58.048
cook a dinner,
put on "Open Arms."

40:58.081 --> 41:00.251
-And what is...
-Just do it.

41:00.284 --> 41:02.586
And... you know,
I'm gonna go now

41:02.619 --> 41:05.122
and, uh, bang my head
against a wall.

41:05.156 --> 41:06.757
So good night.

41:06.790 --> 41:09.092
*

41:11.495 --> 41:13.497
Whew. Okay.

41:20.171 --> 41:22.606
*

41:25.642 --> 41:28.945
All we're asking is that Marcus
be placed in a different class.

41:28.979 --> 41:30.281
We want to rest easy knowing

41:30.314 --> 41:31.448
that James
isn't being influenced

41:31.482 --> 41:32.849
by negative elements at school.

41:32.883 --> 41:35.252
Marcus wasn't the one
who started this.

41:35.286 --> 41:38.655
Look, I know you think your son
is this sweet little angel,

41:38.689 --> 41:40.457
but trust me,
he's got you snowed.

41:40.491 --> 41:42.659
Okay. Let's all just try
to calm dow...

41:42.693 --> 41:45.496
try to be respectful
of the process here.

41:45.529 --> 41:48.098
We all want to get
to the bottom of this.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.666
Now, truthfully,
both of your boys

41:49.700 --> 41:51.602
have shown
rebellious tendencies lately.

41:51.635 --> 41:53.370
-James?
-Yes.

41:53.404 --> 41:55.372
Well, then it must have begun
when he started

41:55.406 --> 41:57.641
-hanging around Marcus.
-ISAAC: May I ask

41:57.674 --> 41:59.610
how James is faring
in his studies?

41:59.643 --> 42:01.345
James gets straight As.

42:01.378 --> 42:03.514
That's...
not completely accurate.

42:03.547 --> 42:05.148
JODY:
I've seen his report cards.

42:05.182 --> 42:06.850
Well, I mean,
he-he does fine,

42:06.883 --> 42:09.486
but he's a B-minus student,
occasional "C."

42:09.520 --> 42:11.288
Not worth being
overly concerned,

42:11.322 --> 42:12.556
but he definitely has
more smarts

42:12.589 --> 42:14.191
-than he gives his work.
-Okay, wait.

42:14.225 --> 42:15.526
This doesn't make any sense.

42:15.559 --> 42:17.861
May I access your class files?

42:17.894 --> 42:19.363
Of course.

42:24.535 --> 42:26.069
As I suspected.

42:26.102 --> 42:29.039
His official report card
shows consistent As.

42:29.072 --> 42:30.207
-That's right.
-Mm-hmm.

42:30.241 --> 42:32.643
Further analysis reveals

42:32.676 --> 42:35.679
a recent alteration
using external algorithms.

42:35.712 --> 42:37.214
The entry code corresponds

42:37.248 --> 42:39.250
to you comscanner, Lieutenant.

42:39.283 --> 42:41.652
-Mine?
-Doctor, would you describe

42:41.685 --> 42:44.054
Marcus's academic performance?

42:44.087 --> 42:46.257
Um, he gets Bs, usually,

42:46.290 --> 42:48.292
maybe one or two As.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.228
That is accurate.

42:51.262 --> 42:52.896
It is reasonable to surmise

42:52.929 --> 42:54.865
that whoever hacked
into the food synthesizer

42:54.898 --> 42:56.833
would also possess
the resourcefulness

42:56.867 --> 42:59.403
to enter
the student records database.

42:59.436 --> 43:01.505
As James's grades
have been altered

43:01.538 --> 43:03.740
and Marcus's have not,
one must conclude

43:03.774 --> 43:06.543
James is the guilty party.

43:06.577 --> 43:08.078
NATHAN:
I...

43:08.111 --> 43:09.346
I can't believe it.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.181
ISAAC: It would seem
that your accusations

43:11.214 --> 43:13.950
were unwarranted,
Nathan and Jody.

43:13.984 --> 43:16.119
I will be forced to report
your son's violations

43:16.152 --> 43:17.388
to Commander Grayson.

43:17.421 --> 43:19.022
In the meantime,

43:19.055 --> 43:22.125
I would recommend you discipline
your son accordingly.

43:26.630 --> 43:29.099
Oh, my gosh, you were amazing.

43:29.132 --> 43:30.567
I love you.

43:30.601 --> 43:32.536
I merely inferred
the most likely scenario

43:32.569 --> 43:34.705
using the available facts

43:34.738 --> 43:37.474
and my own observations
of the children.

43:37.508 --> 43:39.109
Isaac...

43:39.142 --> 43:41.945
would you be my date
to Bortus's Ja'loja?

43:41.978 --> 43:43.280
If you wish.

43:44.315 --> 43:45.949
I wish.

43:45.982 --> 43:48.018
*

43:50.921 --> 43:52.155
Okay, there she is.

43:52.188 --> 43:54.057
She's all alone,
so this is your chance.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.727
-You can do this, all right?
-Yeah, okay.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.862
Here goes.

44:04.468 --> 44:06.803
Can't do it.
Thanks for the help.

44:06.837 --> 44:09.473
(over comm):
All hands, this is the captain.

44:09.506 --> 44:12.042
We are entering orbit of Moclus.

44:14.478 --> 44:16.480
*

44:29.460 --> 44:32.996
In the sight of those
who stand with me,

44:33.029 --> 44:37.534
and those for whom
I would sacrifice my being,

44:37.568 --> 44:39.703
I begin...

44:39.736 --> 44:41.872
the release.

44:47.644 --> 44:50.313
BORTUS:
Kalaskacha.

44:50.347 --> 44:53.817
Mech-gadlas fekto

44:53.850 --> 44:56.720
roschas...

44:56.753 --> 44:59.390
(chanting):
bam...

44:59.423 --> 45:02.058
val...

45:02.092 --> 45:04.060
(last syllable echoing)

45:09.433 --> 45:10.634
Ja'loja!

45:10.667 --> 45:13.136
ALL:
Ja'loja!

45:13.169 --> 45:16.873
(piano plays arpeggio)

45:16.907 --> 45:19.543
(playing "As Time Goes By")

45:29.352 --> 45:31.321
BORTUS:
I hope you enjoyed

45:31.354 --> 45:33.323
the ceremony, Commander.

45:33.356 --> 45:35.358
I did. I did very much.

45:35.392 --> 45:38.495
I can honestly say I've never
seen anything quite like it.

45:38.529 --> 45:40.296
Hope you washed your hands.

45:41.632 --> 45:44.234
Well... I can't wait
for the next one.

45:44.267 --> 45:47.237
We will certainly include you,
Commander.

45:47.270 --> 45:49.573
Topa, come along.

45:51.207 --> 45:53.710
Hey. You're the best,
you know that?

45:53.744 --> 45:54.911
Aw, come on.

45:54.945 --> 45:56.747
Red wine and "Open Arms"?

45:56.780 --> 45:58.415
I knew I liked you, but...

45:58.449 --> 46:00.751
that right there was
the moment you won me over.

46:00.784 --> 46:04.054
What can I say?
You inspire me to be creative.

46:07.123 --> 46:09.893
You, sir, are forgiven.

46:09.926 --> 46:13.564
"My fingers ache
to penetrate the hearth.

46:13.597 --> 46:17.568
Love is the fishhook
that hooks the fish."

46:17.601 --> 46:18.802
Oh, my God.

46:18.835 --> 46:20.236
-What do you think?
-Dude,

46:20.270 --> 46:23.206
that is just, like,
an emotional sucker punch.

46:23.239 --> 46:24.274
-Really?
-Yeah.

46:24.307 --> 46:26.142
Like, I-I've had
a really bad week

46:26.176 --> 46:28.912
where I've just been grappling
with insecurity and self-doubt,

46:28.945 --> 46:31.147
and then here comes
this lyrical compass

46:31.181 --> 46:33.984
that just instantly guides me
to my special place

46:34.017 --> 46:35.118
in the universe.

46:35.151 --> 46:36.252
You should write a book.

46:36.286 --> 46:37.588
I was thinking I might,

46:37.621 --> 46:39.890
but now I definitely will.

46:39.923 --> 46:42.225
-All right for me.
-Yeah.
-CLAIRE: Isaac, I know

46:42.258 --> 46:44.961
it doesn't mean anything to you,
but what you did for me

46:44.995 --> 46:46.763
and for Marcus
is really special.

46:46.797 --> 46:48.331
I wish you could feel that.

46:48.364 --> 46:51.234
That is not possible
for an artificial life-form.

46:51.267 --> 46:53.837
But it was fascinating
to observe.

46:53.870 --> 46:56.172
Isaac... I owe you one.

46:58.709 --> 47:01.077
I'll tell you, you know
what would be great right now?

47:01.111 --> 47:03.780
-A Krill invasion.
-Well, for what it's worth,

47:03.814 --> 47:06.116
it sounds like you did
the honorable thing.

47:06.149 --> 47:07.951
Well, if those two
wind up together because of me,

47:07.984 --> 47:10.587
-you may have to shoot me.
-My friend, I have learned

47:10.621 --> 47:12.589
never to make predictions

47:12.623 --> 47:14.491
in matters of love.

47:14.525 --> 47:16.493
I'm usually dead wrong.

47:16.527 --> 47:18.495
Well, here's to being wrong.

47:18.529 --> 47:19.796
Hmm.

47:22.132 --> 47:23.500
JANEL:
Hey.

47:23.534 --> 47:25.602
Is anyone sitting here?

47:25.636 --> 47:27.337
Uh, no.

47:27.370 --> 47:30.473
(piano continues playing
"As Time Goes By")

47:33.376 --> 47:35.378
