BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

00:07.425 --> 00:10.167
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.386 --> 00:13.219
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.431 --> 00:16.798
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:17.018 --> 00:19.725
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother, but in doing so,

00:19.937 --> 00:22.349
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.432
And I am the only one fast enough
to stop them.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.562
7157171315411

00:28.905 --> 00:30.941
BARRY: Previously on The Flash...

00:31.449 --> 00:33.861
-Nol
-The man who saved Central City.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.570
Why did you wanna kill me?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.162
He promised he'd take me home...

00:37.371 --> 00:38.702
-Who?
-Zoom.

00:38.915 --> 00:39.995
Wells killed my mother.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.120
I don't know anything anymore,
especially who I can and can't trust.

00:43.336 --> 00:45.167
S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.085
People can't just waltz
in and out of here.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.333
Exactly.

00:48.799 --> 00:49.879
Stay where you are.

00:50.092 --> 00:53.505
My name is Jay Garrick.
And your world is in danger.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.756
Bany Allen.

00:55.973 --> 00:59.090
Please. just let me explain.
I mean you no harm.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.390
How do you know my name?

01:00.603 --> 01:04.721
I know all your names. Caitlin Snow.
Cisco Ramon. Detective Joe West.

01:04.941 --> 01:08.399
Enoughl That part about "explaining"
needs to happen right about now.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.317
This world is in danger.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.190
I'l'IWMme]

01:12.406 --> 01:14.442
When you created the Singularity
above Central City,

01:14.659 --> 01:17.571
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.243
I'm sony. A breach?

01:19.455 --> 01:21.867
Yes. A portal, connecting our two Earths.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.540
And what precisely is your concern?

01:24.752 --> 01:28.244
A few days ago, you found a dead man
named AI Rothstein at the nuclear plant.

01:28.464 --> 01:30.625
But then, a different AI Rothstein
tried to kill you.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.253
That man was from my world.

01:33.469 --> 01:36.302
If he got through the breach.
I suspect there'll be more to follow.

01:36.514 --> 01:42.225
Okay. So, Jay,
how exactly do you know all this?

01:42.436 --> 01:45.974
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.272
They called me the Flash.

01:55.533 --> 02:00.027
JAY: Before I arrived on your Earth,
I was in a ﬁght with a man named Zoom.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.237
rm?)

02:06.043 --> 02:09.831
Atom Smasher, he said
Zoom sent him here to kill me.

02:10.673 --> 02:11.708
Who is this guy?

02:11.882 --> 02:14.168
He's a speedster, like you and me.
And fast.

02:14.385 --> 02:17.172
Maybe the fastest of all, but evil.

02:17.388 --> 02:20.755
He is an unstoppable demon
with the face of death.

02:24.562 --> 02:26.769
We were engaged
in our ﬁercest battle ever,

02:26.981 --> 02:30.189
racing throughout my city,
but I wasn't fast enough to stop him.

02:30.401 --> 02:32.767
(SCREAMS) Zoom had me beaten.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.477
[W

02:34.905 --> 02:36.406
He was about to kill me, when suddenly,

02:36.615 --> 02:39.197
there was a blinding light,
and the sky split open.

02:40.244 --> 02:44.328
A breach, between my world and yours
caused ﬁom the Singularity.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.080
It pulled me in

02:52.548 --> 02:55.255
and I somehow ended up in your world.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.960
What do you mean?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.420
I lost my speed.

03:00.806 --> 03:01.841
mm

03:02.058 --> 03:03.923
I'm not entirely sure.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.223
So, you've been in Central City
for six months.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.896
Why haven't you come to see us before?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.895
I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.
I didn't know who you all were.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.147
Took me that long
to piece it all together.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.777
So that's how you know our names.
You've been following us.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.241
Look, I know how this sounds.

03:23.996 --> 03:27.409
The existence of another Earth,
you, another Flash?

03:28.334 --> 03:31.041
It all came as an unexpected shock
to me, too.

03:31.796 --> 03:34.538
I just wish there was something
I could do to convince you.

03:34.757 --> 03:39.171
There is.
We're gonna do some tests on you.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.423
See if you're telling us the truth.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.381
Because if you're not. this Zoom

03:46.644 --> 03:48.976
is not gonna be your only enemy.

03:57.113 --> 03:58.444
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

04:00.032 --> 04:01.147
mmmmmn

04:01.367 --> 04:05.656
(DISTORTED) You wanna go home?
You only have to do one thing.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.988
-What's that?
-(DISTORTED) Kill the Flash.

04:12.962 --> 04:17.296
So, Mr. Garrick, how long have you been
the Flash on your world?

04:17.508 --> 04:18.873
Not long enough to call me "Mister."

04:19.093 --> 04:20.128
(LIGHT CHUCKLE)

04:20.344 --> 04:21.379
Please. it's Jay.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.672
Jay, of course.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.300
On my world, I've been the Flash
for about two years.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.723
And how did you get your speed?

04:27.935 --> 04:31.052
I'm not really sure. I was at my lab
trying to purify heavy water

04:31.272 --> 04:34.810
without any residual radiation
when there was a blinding light.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.276
Uh, I fell into a coma.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.726
When I woke up, I could run
almost as fast as the speed of light.

04:39.905 --> 04:43.944
Sony, did you say "lab?"
Are you a scientist?

04:44.160 --> 04:47.072
Well, certainly didn't work at a place
like this but yeah.

04:47.288 --> 04:49.404
I had a respectable solo operation.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.330
Part-time chemist. Part-time physicist.
Part-time superhero.

04:52.543 --> 04:53.578
:l'ﬁTﬁl

04:53.794 --> 04:56.331
I can forget that
superhero part now though, huh. (CHUCKLES)

04:57.882 --> 05:00.919
Is any of this possible? A breach
to another Earth? It's not. right?

05:01.135 --> 05:03.842
The contrary. Just recently,
the many-different-worlds theory proposed

05:04.054 --> 05:07.091
interaction with parallel universes
was plausible.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.923
Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.384
that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

05:11.604 --> 05:12.684
It doesn't add up.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.478
I'm gonna be honest here.
I don't understand

05:14.690 --> 05:16.396
what the hell any of you
are talking about.

05:16.609 --> 05:20.818
So, Jay is saying he's from,
like, a mirror world.

05:21.030 --> 05:25.364
Or a parallel universe,
that's very, very similar to ours.

05:25.576 --> 05:28.488
Multi-verse would be
a more apt description.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.327
Nope. Not helping.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.246
-Bless your heart.
-Okay. see if this helps.

05:36.253 --> 05:40.963
This is our Earth.
Let's call it, Earth One.

05:43.052 --> 05:47.842
And this second Earth,
let's call it, Earth Two.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.594
This is where Jay claims to be from.

05:50.809 --> 05:56.349
And these other Earths,
three, four. ﬁve, to inﬁnity.

05:56.732 --> 06:02.068
All of them are nearly identical to ours,
and, uh, they all exist at the same time,

06:02.279 --> 06:05.487
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

06:05.699 --> 06:09.783
For example, uh, the Joe West
on Earth Two. your doppelganger,

06:09.995 --> 06:13.738
he might not be a detective. He could be
a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

06:13.958 --> 06:17.246
And you, the Bany Allen here
is the Flash,

06:17.461 --> 06:21.045
but over there,
he could be an electrician.

06:21.257 --> 06:25.421
So I'm assuming that
the people on all these other Earths

06:25.636 --> 06:28.002
work to make money to pay bills and such?

06:28.222 --> 06:29.928
-I would imagine.
-So we got that in common.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.177
I'm heading back to the station. Call me
when this makes a little bit more sense.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.680
I'm still trying to wrap my head
around the whole idea of time travel.

06:35.938 --> 06:36.973
(CHUCKLES)

06:39.692 --> 06:42.104
There is one problem that remains.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.275
If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth,

06:44.488 --> 06:46.479
there is a breach
somewhere in Central City

06:46.699 --> 06:49.111
that we need to ﬁnd. And close for good.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.113
Yeah, but how do we ﬁnd it?
We don't even know what to look for.

06:52.329 --> 06:56.993
Well, I suggest we put our heads
together and come up with a solution.

06:57.501 --> 07:01.710
Not literally, of course.
Those days are over.

07:06.677 --> 07:07.712
What'd you ﬁnd?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.214
Well, Jay's heart rate
is extraordinarily low.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.173
And he does have
regenerative capabilities.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.132
Other than that,
I'm not seeing any evidence

07:15.352 --> 07:16.728
of the speed force in his system.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.644
We don't even have proof that he's
a speedster, much less from another Earth?

07:19.857 --> 07:22.314
-Not necessarily.
-What does that mean?

07:22.526 --> 07:25.142
Well, Jay doesn't know this,
but while I was testing

07:25.362 --> 07:27.478
his heart rate, blood pressure
and motor responses,

07:27.698 --> 07:31.691
I also measured his autonomic reactions
while we were talking.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.571
You gave him a lie-detector test?

07:33.954 --> 07:34.989
And he passed it.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.535
What if he's not a good guy,
and he just wants to ﬁnd our weaknesses?

07:42.755 --> 07:45.417
Keep running tests.
See what else you can ﬁnd out.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.546
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

07:57.269 --> 07:59.009
PATTY: Detective West, sir.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.887
Yes. Ofﬁcer...

08:02.107 --> 08:04.143
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.896
Captain Singh mentioned
there may be positions available

08:06.111 --> 08:07.567
on your anti-meta-human task force.

08:07.780 --> 08:10.146
Yeah. Everybody quit.
There is no task force anymore.

08:10.366 --> 08:12.106
Well, I know someone
who's interested in being on it.

08:13.786 --> 08:14.821

08:16.955 --> 08:18.240
-have super-powers, right?
-Yeah.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.620
And even if they didn't.
you wouldn't be a good ﬁt for the team.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.793
I didn't mean to imply that.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.417
Good, because I know
how difﬁcult this job would be,

08:27.633 --> 08:29.339
mnmwmlmmm

08:29.551 --> 08:31.928
I triple-majored at Hudson
in Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

08:32.137 --> 08:35.925
I'm in prime physical condition. And.
I rated top of my class in marksmanship.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.757
Your class? You don't even have
your stripes yet.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.592
Soon. Been on the job seven months, sir.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.644
Are you aware of what happened
to my previous partner?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.892
Detective Thawne. yes.
I know that he died.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.441
and the one before him,
Fred Chyre, died, too.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.939
But the one before, that's not dead,
just transferred.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.986
I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.731
Listen, Ofﬁcer...

08:53.951 --> 08:55.361
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.533
Yes. Spivot. The answer's no.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.704
All I'm asking for is a shot. sir.
Please. just an interview.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.407
You just had the interview.
Didn't get the job.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.798
I hope you understand
why we have to do this.

09:14.972 --> 09:18.135
I get it, kid. You're doing
what you think you have to.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.300
But you'll all realize soon enough
that this, the tests,

09:21.562 --> 09:24.144
it's unnecessary.
I want to help you, Bany. Not harm you.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.270
You're not the ﬁrst person
that's said that to me.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.896
If what you told me about Zoom is true.
that he sent Rothstein here to kill you,

09:30.112 --> 09:32.148
instead of locking me up in here,
you better start listening.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.734
Because if Zoom is involved,
you are going to need

09:34.950 --> 09:37.487
a lot more than just me
at your side to stay alive.

Got a pretty solid look at him

-Hi.

I'm really excited to meet you.
I'm a huge fan.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.911
-Excuse me?
-Your forensic reports.

11:54.631 --> 11:58.544
I read them sometimes. Who am I kidding?
All the time. I've actually read them all.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.966
(CHUCKLES)

12:00.137 --> 12:02.469
Wow, I don't think
that I've read them all.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.630
They're always so detailed, you know.
They really paint a picture

12:04.808 --> 12:08.141
like you were somehow actually there
when somebody was being brutally murdered.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.644
Thank you.

12:11.648 --> 12:15.311
Uh, anyhow. I found, uh, something.
Well, I think I found something.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.567
It's just a theory,
but I would like to show you.

12:17.779 --> 12:18.814
[m

12:18.989 --> 12:22.322
So, this right here
is the point of origin of the ﬁre.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.984
And look. I don't know
a sand blaster on the market

12:26.246 --> 12:30.080
that can make a cut that precise. So,
I think a meta-human may have done this.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.499
Here. I took a sample for you.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.580
Uh, there's also some ﬁngerprints
on the back of the pipe.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.086
Should've gone into CSI work.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.836
I love the science,
but out here's where all the action is.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.799
-Isn't that right, Detective West?
-(CHUCKLES)

12:42.512 --> 12:44.173
The answer's still "no," Ofﬁcer—

12:44.348 --> 12:45.428
-Spivot.
-Spivot.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.008

12:49.186 --> 12:51.142
I'm trying to join
the anti-meta-human task force.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.344
Ah.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.473
But you heard him.
Hey, he's kind of like your dad, right?

12:55.692 --> 12:58.024
So, do you have any advice
on how I can crack his "no" code?

12:58.195 --> 12:59.651
Yeah, I've been trying to pick that lock

12:59.863 --> 13:01.103
-since I was 11.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.359
So, if you ﬁgure it out,
how about you let me know?

13:03.617 --> 13:04.697
-Deal.
-All right.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.029
-It was nice to meet you, Bany.
-Yeah, you, too.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.284
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:16.880 --> 13:18.996
CAITLIN: His blood pressure is low.
his heart rate is low.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.548
his oxygen levels are impressive.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.713
Yeah, but nothing compared to Bany's.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.004
No, but he's certainly
in the physical specimen range.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.549
-In more ways than one?
-Hmm?

13:30.978 --> 13:35.847
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.
That's enough for today, Jay. Thank you.

13:40.237 --> 13:43.354

from the meta-human that attacked me.

:D'lil

13:44.866 --> 13:46.606
-What is this stuff? Sand?
-(SIGHS)

13:46.868 --> 13:49.701
It's not sand. It's human cells
whose myosin-two protein

13:49.913 --> 13:51.904
have migrated to the cells' periphery.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.913
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.746
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

13:56.920 --> 13:58.911
giving them the appearance of sand.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.587
Mmm, how do you know this?

14:01.091 --> 14:03.582
They belong to a meta-human
I've fought before named Sand Demon.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.217
I know you're new here,
so I'm just gonna break it down for you.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.137
The whole naming the bad guys thing,
that's my jam.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.927
But you know what?
I'm gonna let you have that one,

14:11.143 --> 14:12.883
'cause I actually kind of like it.
I'm not mad at that one.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.138
Is that Bany's sweatshirt?

14:14.396 --> 14:16.933
Oh, uh, sony. It was all we could ﬁnd.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.312
I was gonna say 'cause it looks
a lot smaller on you, right?

14:20.569 --> 14:21.604
(CHUCKLES)

14:24.489 --> 14:26.070
I gotta do this thing.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.616
So, who is this Sand Demon?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.448
I don't know his name,
but I know how to stop him.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.455
You know what,
I think we'll be ﬁne on our own.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.664
Look, Bany, I don't know what else
I can do to prove to you I'm on your side.

14:39.921 --> 14:44.130
I've been poked, prodded, I even
subjected myself to a full body scan.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.461
I was being thorough.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.965
Sand Demon's from my world.
Let me teach you how to stop him.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.968
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.804
Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.806
He must've sent Sand Demon here
to do the same thing.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.811
Don't you get it?
Anyone close to the Flash,

14:58.982 --> 15:00.643
all of you, are in a lot of danger!

15:00.859 --> 15:05.944
All right. If you were so good,
you would've caught him already.

Let's get Jay back to his cell.

15:24.007 --> 15:27.374
After some lengthy calculations,
I believe I have discovered

15:27.636 --> 15:30.844
the key to proving
the proposed breach theory.

15:33.725 --> 15:34.805
:D'lil

15:35.060 --> 15:37.517

Mr. Garrick is talking about is real.

15:48.031 --> 15:53.526
if there is indeed a hole in our universe
which leads to his Earth...

15:53.703 --> 15:57.696
We can make some adjustments and
upload an electrophotography program

15:57.874 --> 15:58.909
to the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite

15:59.167 --> 16:02.409
and essentially photograph
the exotic matter leak.

16:02.921 --> 16:06.163
Thereby giving us
the locale of said breach.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.419

it was in the fabrication room.

We tracked those prints to his address.

All right. Where are you?
I'll meet you there.

There you go. genius. It's the ﬁre
you started in the third ward last night.

-Well, let me guess.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.702
You don't start ﬁres anymore.
You've been rehabilitated.

You know, like acetone or somethin'.

18:14.511 --> 18:18.174
Or maybe you don't need to use
accelerants anymore.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.802
Iron Heights can hold people like you now.
You know that, right?

18:21.017 --> 18:23.394
What, you think I'm one of those
meta-human freaks?

18:23.645 --> 18:26.887

I would've used 'em to get away from you?

to conﬁrm something for me.

So, Joe told me what you did.
I'm impressed.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.365

18:43.540 --> 18:44.905
run the other print
from the electrical pipe,

18:45.166 --> 18:46.906

about the Sand Demon?

20:08.625 --> 20:13.210

But I'm not gonna just believe some guy

that sort of check out.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.299

He had a little shoe shop
down on Chesterﬁeld.

36:20.471 --> 36:24.714
It was a cash business.
and one night, he went to Fairﬁeld Bank

36:24.933 --> 36:28.266

and the Mardon brothers showed up.

36:30.773 --> 36:34.561

Mark shot my dad

Mark and his brother got powers.

of such a prediction?

when Atom Smasher attacked on Flash Day,

38:49.620 --> 38:51.952
and then again when Sand Demon showed up.

of something that's already happened.

38:59.588 --> 39:01.328
And then it's gone.

study this. Figure out just what to do to.

telling anybody either.

39:23.487 --> 39:26.729
Professor, I don't want anyone
to know about this.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.272
Not yet.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.319
It's okay to be afraid, you know.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.364
Wells told me this was in my future,

39:38.377 --> 39:40.789
that he gave me this power.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.047
But everything he did was evil.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.971
That's what scares me. Professor.

39:50.472 --> 39:54.841
You have to promise me
that you won't tell anyone about this.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.468
I promise.

39:58.814 --> 39:59.849
(MACHINE BEEPS RAPIDLY)

40:03.151 --> 40:04.186
Oh, wow.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.814
It appears that while we were indeed
successful in closing the Singularity,

40:10.033 --> 40:12.991
-there was an unfortunate side effect.
-What are you talking about?

40:13.203 --> 40:17.037
Using electrophotography, Cisco and I
were able to search Central City

40:17.249 --> 40:21.242
for any signs of energy
entering our Earth from another dimension.

40:21.461 --> 40:24.624
From any breaches,
as Mr. Garrick described them.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.707
But of course.
there isn't just one breach.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.417
There's 52 of them,
scattered throughout the city.

40:30.637 --> 40:36.132
Uh, these breaches are pockets of time
and space, folded into and upon itself.

40:36.351 --> 40:40.185
But the most signiﬁcant breach of all
appears to be this one.

40:42.274 --> 40:44.811
And where exactly is that located?

40:45.193 --> 40:48.185
It's here. Inside S.T.A.R. Labs.

40:48.405 --> 40:51.863
And just beyond that breach
is an entirely—

Or. as it's more commonly known,
S.T.A.R. Labs.

41:18.644 --> 41:21.727
Founded in 1991,
S.T.A.R. Labs is leading the world

41:21.938 --> 41:26.022

41:29.655 --> 41:34.490
Specializing in artiﬁcial intelligence,
genetics, and meta-human—

41:34.868 --> 41:35.903
Oh.
