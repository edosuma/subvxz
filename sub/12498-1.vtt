00:00.800 --> 00:02.500
previously on "october road",

00:02.500 --> 00:03.700
want to see you.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.600
 <I>Really</I> See You.
Will You Let Me Do That?

00:05.800 --> 00:09.100
Do You Ever Think
That Maybe You're My Dad?

00:09.100 --> 00:13.200
I Have No Home. 
My Alison And Ikey Have Been Together.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.600
- How Could You? He Was Your Best Friend?
- Owen?

00:15.800 --> 00:17.800
He Grabbed A Case Of Whiskey
And Then He Left.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.900
Bring Him Back To Me, Nick.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.300
I Hear You're Going After Owen.
I'm Coming With You.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.800
I Want You Guys
In My Life.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.000
And It's Not About
Whether I'm Sam's Father.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.500
What It Comes Down To--
We All Fall In Love Sometimes.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.500
Nick Told You
He Wand To Be With You?

00:48.900 --> 00:50.500
That You Were "The One"?

00:50.900 --> 00:52.200
After All These Years?

00:53.500 --> 00:54.500
And What Did You Say?

00:58.100 --> 00:59.300
What Did You Say?

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
Nothing.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.800
You Said Nothing?

01:03.300 --> 01:05.300
Ten Years Later, he tells You
He Wants To Be With You,

01:05.300 --> 01:08.500
That You Were "The One."
You Say Nothing?

01:10.700 --> 01:11.500
You're Right.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.100
So What Are You Waiting For?

01:17.600 --> 01:18.900
Attagirl!

01:40.300 --> 01:41.400
Nick?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.100
What Goes On, Hannah?

01:49.000 --> 01:49.900
Hannah?

02:07.700 --> 02:09.000
Everything You Said...

02:10.199 --> 02:12.500
I've Waited So Long
To Hear You Say It.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.800
So We Can Try?

02:16.800 --> 02:19.000
I Mean,
For Real This Time?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.100
Yes.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.600
I Just Need To Know
One Thing.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.400
You Have To Promise Me
One Thing, Nick.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.300
What?

02:26.400 --> 02:27.600
That You'll Stay.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.600
You Won't Leave.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.200
I Can't Handle It Again.

02:34.100 --> 02:35.100
Tell Me.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.200
 <I> Ma.</I>

02:38.500 --> 02:39.600
 <I>Ma.</I>

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Mom.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.500
You Should Come Inside.
It's Getting Cold Out Here.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.700
Yeah, Thanks, Buddy.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.600
Boy, Did I Conk Out.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.500
I Hope Nick's Okay.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.600
What Do You Mean?

02:57.100 --> 02:59.300
He Seemed Pretty Upset
When He Left Here.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.000
Oh, I'm Sure He's Fine.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.000
He's Gone, You Know.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.100
- He's Gone? Where?
- To New York.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.200
I Saw Ronnie Before. 
Nick Went To New York With Eddie.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.100
With Eddie?

03:12.100 --> 03:13.700
He Said They Went
To Get Owen.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.200
New York.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.100
Hey, Brett.
It's Nick Garrett Again.

03:31.100 --> 03:34.200
Uh, Listen, 
Your Brother's Still Not Picking Up His Cell,

03:34.200 --> 03:36.500
So Can You Just Call Us Back
On This Number

03:36.500 --> 03:37.500
If You're With Him?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.500
We're Both Really Worried
About Owen, All Right, Man?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.000
Good-Bye.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.000
Let's Just Go Back To My Place
Till We Hear From Them.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.300
You Don't Really Think
That Owen Would Leave His Kids

03:55.300 --> 03:56.600
And Move Here, Do You?

03:58.200 --> 04:00.500
Although Big Boy Brett
Is Very Persuasive.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.400
24-Hour Pizza. Huh.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.300
is that why you stayed?

04:07.100 --> 04:08.100
What Do You Mean?

04:08.500 --> 04:11.000
Oh, Nothing. It's Just...
That Maybe Being Here,

04:11.000 --> 04:11.900
I'll Find Out Why It Is

04:11.900 --> 04:13.600
You Didn't Come Home
All These Years...

04:14.700 --> 04:18.200
Just Why It Is You Stayed
In New York City.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.900
Is--Is That Why You Stayed?

04:28.400 --> 04:29.700
Still Not Funny.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.600
You Know, I-I Gotta Say,
It Doesn't Surprise Me

04:33.800 --> 04:36.500
That You Knew All Along That
Ikey Was Sleeping With Alison,

04:37.600 --> 04:40.300
Because That's What You Do,
Nicky. You Meddle.

04:40.300 --> 04:43.200
I Did The Exact Opposite Of Meddle. 
I Stayed Out Of It.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.300
You Stayed Out Of It? How?
How Did You stay out of it?

04:45.300 --> 04:47.000
I Told Ikey
Not To Say Anything.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.700
I Just--I Told Him To Keep It
In The Vault.

04:48.700 --> 04:52.100
Oh, Right. That's Your Idea
Of Staying Out Of It, Huh?

04:52.600 --> 04:53.200
In A Way.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.700
I Mean, You Always Did It,
Even In High School.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.900
You Really Oughta Learn
To Mind Your Own Business, Man.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.500
Ikey Told Me
About Him And Alison, Okay?

05:00.500 --> 05:03.800
- I Was Burden with the information.
- You Just Gotta Learn, Nicky.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.000
Keep Out
Of Other People's Kitchens.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.800
Here's My Building.
Just Park.

05:19.700 --> 05:23.000
You Want Some?
You Got Some. 

05:27.100 --> 05:28.100
Move Along, Big Cat.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.900
Listen, Davy Boy,
I Came To Apologize

05:30.900 --> 05:33.300
For Blowing Up Your Spot.
All Right?

05:33.800 --> 05:34.900
I Did What I Had To Do.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.700
Look, I Never Thought There'd Be
This Much Collateral Damage.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.800
What You Did--Telling Owen
About Me And His Wife

05:40.800 --> 05:42.000
Just to Get Back
At Nick Garrett--

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
You Didn't Just Blow Things Up.
You Scorched The Earth.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.500
A Little Overstated,
Don't You Think?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.300
Flare For The Dramatic,
Do Ya?

05:56.300 --> 05:59.000
No, Big Cat.
No, I Don't.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.900
But Let's Look
At The Results.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.700
You Don't Got Hannah.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.700
Owen Don't Got His Family.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.000
I Don't Got No Friends
And No Job.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.900
All Right,Ell,
The Job I Can Help You With.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.800
How Do You Figure?

06:17.500 --> 06:19.300
Cataldo Builders
Will Pay You More In A Week

06:19.300 --> 06:20.300
Than You Would've Made
In A Month

06:20.300 --> 06:21.500
At Latekka Landscaping.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.900
Oh...
Not In A Million Years, Dude!

06:27.400 --> 06:28.300
If We Lived In A World

06:28.300 --> 06:30.100
Where You Could Only Do
One Of Two Things--

06:30.100 --> 06:31.900
Either Work For You

06:32.600 --> 06:34.900
Or Eat Meals
Marinated In Maggots...

06:35.800 --> 06:37.100
Guess Which I'd Do?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.400
Eat Maggots?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.200
Hell, No!
What Am I, A Freak?

06:41.600 --> 06:44.600
I'd Work For You.
The Thing Is, Big Cat,

06:44.900 --> 06:46.300
We Don't Live
In That World.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.700
Thanks For The Beer.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.200
Wow. Maybe I Should Write
A Book That Takes A ???

07:06.200 --> 07:07.000
On All My Old Friends.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.700
- Maybe You Should Read A Book First.
- I Read Books.

07:09.700 --> 07:11.900
Reprinted Lyrics on ??? cd

07:11.900 --> 07:14.700
- Aren't Books, Eddie.
- I'm Just Saying, Look At This Place.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.100
Getting Into Other People's
Kitchens Has Been Good To You.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.400
Speaking Of Kitchens,
Look At Yours.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.600
You Could Braise
A Brontosaurus In Here.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.800
Look At This Island.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.500
Nantucket
Is A Smaller Island.

07:25.500 --> 07:29.000
- How Much Longer You Gonna Resent Me, Eddie?
- I Don't Resent You, Nick.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.000
I Just Don't Understand

07:30.000 --> 07:32.500
Why You Gotta Make Things
So Complicated All The Time.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.400
Nicholson? I Thought
You Were Never Coming Back.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.100
Wait. Don't Tell Me.
 <I>This</I> Is Why You Stayed.

Eddie, Amiquay.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.900
Amiquay, Eddie.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.100
Hello!

08:05.900 --> 08:08.200
So... What's Going On?
Are You Back For Good?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.300
No, We're Just Here
To Rescue A Friend

08:10.300 --> 08:12.800
From The Clutches
Of His Demented Brother.

08:13.800 --> 08:14.900
What's With The Sax?

08:14.900 --> 08:17.400
I'm Gonna Take It Up. 
Remember That Homeless Guy On Wooster--

08:17.400 --> 08:19.000
- Mr. Butch?
- Yeah.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.200
- He Said I Should.
- Why?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.000
Well, He Said The Only Thing
Missing From My Life Was A Horn.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.299
- That's Pretty Good.
- Amiquay Is House-Sitting.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.200
She's My buddy Keith's
Girlfriend.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.500
Keith's A Photographer.

08:39.700 --> 08:42.100
He's On Assignment In...
South America?

08:42.100 --> 08:43.600
I Don't Think
He's Ever Coming Home.

08:43.700 --> 08:47.400
- Which Is... Where The Sax Comes In.
- What Do You Mean?

08:48.500 --> 08:52.100
Well, Um... How Else Are You
Supposed To Play The Blues?

08:57.900 --> 08:58.800
Eddie...

08:59.500 --> 09:01.300
Okay, I'm Gonna Crash.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.300
Tomorrow We Find Owen Rowan.

09:04.300 --> 09:07.100
Eddie, Would You Like Me
To Show You To Your Room?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.900
I, Uh, Have To Make A Couple
Calls. I'll, Uh, I'll Find It.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.700
- Okay.
- Is Anyone Hungry?

09:11.700 --> 09:13.800
- Uh, No, We Just Ate.
- I Am Starvin'.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.700
Well, I Made Paella With
Mussels, Clams And Calamari.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.700
I Can Heat It Up.

09:17.700 --> 09:21.200
Oh, No, That's Okay. I Actually,
Uh, I Like My Paella Cold.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.500
You Like Your Paella Cold?

09:28.600 --> 09:29.400
Yeah.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.600
- Do You Even Know What Paella Is?
- Not A Clue.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.200
- Mm.
- But I Know It Has Mussels, Clams And Calamari.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.700
That Is My Friend's Girl.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.400
Lucky Friend.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.300
Thank You.
Wow! That Looks Great.

09:41.700 --> 09:42.900
I Hope You're Hungry.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.600
- Oh, That <I>Smells</I> Good.
- I Got It Fresh.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.100
- Mmm!
- A Little Place I Know In Chinatown.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.200
- Mmm-Mmm.
- Good Night.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.700
- Night, Buddy.
- Night, Nick.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.300
- Mmm, That Looks Good.
- Cheers.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.200
Bravo.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.300
It Was Just A Dream.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.200
I Don't Think You Need To
Read That Much Into It.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.300
It Was Just So Real.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.400
I Once Had A Dream I Was
Eating A 10-Pound Marshmallow,

10:23.400 --> 10:25.600
- And When I Woke Up...
- The Pillow Was Gone.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.200
Yeah. How'd You Know?
I'm Sure The Dream Was A Result

10:29.200 --> 10:31.600
Of Nick's Dramatic Proclamation
On Your Porch.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.100
And Whether You Want
To Admit It Or Not, Lady,

10:35.300 --> 10:37.200
You've Been Waiting
A Long Time To Hear It.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.100
 I Know.
It Was Shocking...

10:41.100 --> 10:42.300
And Upsetting...

10:44.100 --> 10:46.300
But Also It Was
Unbelievably Exciting.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.100
But You Gotta Love
"Unbelievably Exciting," Right?

10:49.300 --> 10:51.100
So Says The Girl
Who Kissed Eddie Latekka.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.800
So Says. And Where's
Eddie Latekka Now?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.100
In New York City,

10:55.100 --> 10:57.400
No Doubt Meeting Models
And C.I.A. Operatives

10:57.400 --> 11:00.900
And Beautiful Animal Rights
Activists With Belly Rings.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.700
Maybe We're Entering
Our Reckless Phase.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.900
I, For One,
Am Overdue For A Phase Change.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.800
I Vote Either Reckless,

11:08.200 --> 11:10.300
Or We Become Gypsies.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.500
- Gypsies?
- Gypsies.

11:11.500 --> 11:15.300
Bangles, Pantaloons,
Tin Spoons, Tambourines.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.000
Werewolves.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.000
There's Alison.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.700
We Should Say Hi.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.800
Poor Thing.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.200
Poor Thing? She Was Sleeping
With Her Husband's Best Friend.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.600
Yeah--Ikey,
Hence, Poor Thing. Come On.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.800
Hey, Alison.

11:35.800 --> 11:36.700
Hello.

11:36.700 --> 11:37.500
How's It Goin'?

11:38.700 --> 11:40.400
Scarlet Letter
Notwithstanding?

11:40.900 --> 11:41.700
We Heard.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.300
I'm Sure You Did.
Everyone Has.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.000
Mr. Cheevers
In The Produce Department

11:46.000 --> 11:48.600
Just Told Me That The Dancy
Tangerines Are In Season

11:49.300 --> 11:50.800
And That I Am An Epic Slut.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.500
So...

11:54.200 --> 11:55.100
I'll Tell You,

11:55.400 --> 11:58.100
Everything Being
A Learning Experience?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.500
There's Nothing Better
Than "Reliable."

12:02.100 --> 12:05.300
The Price Of A Little Danger,
A Little Excitement--

12:05.500 --> 12:08.500
It's Far Too High,
You Know, And For What?

12:08.700 --> 12:11.600
A Little Heat
And Friction And...

12:12.300 --> 12:14.200
Getting To Pretend
You're Someone You're Not...

12:15.700 --> 12:16.600
No Way, Girls.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.600
Take It From Me.
You Wanna Live Dangerously?

12:20.900 --> 12:24.000
Go Buy The "Extra <I>Fuego"</I>
Salsa Instead Of The Mild.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.700
Leave It At That.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.700
So... I'll See Ya.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.900
- Bye.
- See Ya.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.400
You Know,
I Was Thinking,

12:42.600 --> 12:45.400
Maybe We Should Return
This Space To Its Former Self.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.800
Its Former Self
As In Nick's Bedroom?

12:47.800 --> 12:50.500
Huh. It'd Be A Nice Gesture,
When He Gets Back From New York.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.300
Yeah, So's He Doesn't
Have To Sleep

12:52.300 --> 12:55.400
On The Pullout Couch
Off The Kitchen, And, Uh,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.900
Have A Sense Of, Um...
Home.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.500
I Like The Way You Think.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.300
- Yeah?
- I Like It A Lot.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.000
 Hey, It's Ede.
We're Trying To Track Down Owen.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.200
You Got A Cell Number
For His Brother, Big Boy Brett?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.300
I Had The Best Sleep
Of My Life.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.300
- What's With Those Sheets?
- all right, Just Call Me If You Do, Okay?
He's In A Bad Way.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.500
- Yeah, Yeah, Syboy Would Know. Good Idea.
- Yeah, Yeah, I Know.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.500
Who Wouldn't Be? All Right.
Egyptian Cotton. Thank You.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.000
- High Thread Count.
- What Do Egyptians Know About Cotton?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.500
Hey, Jeromy, It's, Uh,
Nick Garrett. I Don't Know.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.300
Maybe It's On Account
Of The Whole Mummy Thing.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.700
Have You Heard
From Owen Rowan?

13:32.100 --> 13:34.200
Hey, What
Happened With You And Amiquay?

13:34.800 --> 13:35.900
That's None
Of Your Business.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, Well, I Think It Is.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
- Did You Do More Than Eat Paella Last Night?
- Hey, Syboy.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.600
eddie Latekka

13:42.000 --> 13:43.100
Hey, You Meddling Again?

13:44.700 --> 13:45.400
Sorry.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.100
Um, Well, Just, Uh,
Call Me Back If You Do.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.400
Okay.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.700
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,
That's A Good Idea.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.300
Baggo Might Know.
Good Thinking, Syboy. Thank You.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.700
God, I Remember That Winter.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.800
God, It Snowed.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.900
Yeah, We Plowed A Lot
Of Driveways, Huh?

14:02.900 --> 14:04.400
You Were Good With A Shovel,
Nicky.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.500
It's Funny, Huh?

14:06.900 --> 14:08.100
It It Weren't For These Mooks,

14:08.700 --> 14:11.900
You Wouldn't Be Living Here
In This 5,000-Square-Foot Loft

14:12.100 --> 14:13.300
With A Beautiful Girl,

14:13.300 --> 14:15.900
Egypti Cotton Sheets
And Not A Care In The World.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.100
Excuse Me.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.700
Hey, Baggo,
It's Eddie Latekka.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.400
Listen, Man, You Got
A Cell Phone Number

14:34.400 --> 14:37.300
For Big Boy Brett Rowan? 
Yeah, We Just Have A Home Number.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.700
Oh, You--You Do?

14:41.900 --> 14:44.300
Okay, Hold--Hold On.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.000
Great, Man. Oh, Wait.
Hey, Baggo,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.200
You Know How Many
Fancy Writer Boys

14:48.200 --> 14:51.900
It Takes To Screw In
A Lightbulb? Nope. None.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.900
'Cause They Have
Their Supermodel Roommates

14:53.900 --> 14:57.300
Do It For 'Em. Later.
We Got It.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.700
When Are You Gonna Stop
Being Such A Tool?

14:59.800 --> 15:02.100
- When You Stop Needing To Be Fixed.
- That's Funny.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.800
- Did You Spend The Whole Drive
Here Thinking Up That One?
- Hello?

15:06.300 --> 15:08.200
Brett... It's Eddie Latekka.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.000
Is That Him--The Guy
That You're Looking For?

15:11.000 --> 15:12.700
No,
It's His Insane Brother.

15:14.200 --> 15:14.800
All Right.

15:17.100 --> 15:17.900
Well?

15:17.900 --> 15:20.000
We're Gonna See Him Tonigh
At A Place Called Rhino Bar.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.300
- Do You Know It?
- Yeah. Did He Say How Owen Was Doin', Or...

15:22.300 --> 15:26.000
He Said Owen's Fine...
And That He's Never Coming Back

15:26.000 --> 15:27.200
To Knights Ridge.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.100
what? that's crazy.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.900
how can he not Come Back To The Ridge?
To His Kids?

15:31.900 --> 15:33.200
I Have No Idea.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.000
Maybe Because
He's Utterly Humiliated?

15:36.600 --> 15:37.700
Come On. Think About It.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.700
Everywhere He Goes
In That Small Town Of Yours,

15:39.700 --> 15:42.200
People Are Gonna Be Pointing
At Him, Talking About Him,

15:42.400 --> 15:44.700
Saying, "That's The Guy
Whose Best Friend Had An Affair

15:44.700 --> 15:47.600
"With His Wife And Whose
Other Best Friend Knew About It

15:47.600 --> 15:48.900
And Didn't Say Anything."

15:50.200 --> 15:53.600
I Mean, Come On. Who's Gonna
Wanna Go Back To That?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.000
Okay, What's Left
On The Docket?

16:21.400 --> 16:24.600
Phmacy, Deli
And Dry Cleaners.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.900
Can I Do That? Please,
Can I Do The Dry Cleaning?

16:28.100 --> 16:31.700
- Sure. Okay, Meet Me At The Sub Shop, Okay?
- All Right.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.800
Nick!

17:00.600 --> 17:01.500
Nick.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.599
I Am So... So Sorry. I Thought
You Were Someone Else.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.700
You Look Lost, Little Girl.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.300
You Need Directions Home?

17:22.300 --> 17:23.300
How You Doing, Ray?

17:23.800 --> 17:27.400
Better Now. It's Always Good
To See You, Hannah Jane.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.400
What Have You Been Up To?

17:30.700 --> 17:33.600
Same Old Song. Trying To Bring
More Retail Space To The Ridge.
Mm.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.000
- This Is My Favorite Part.
- What's That?

17:38.800 --> 17:41.500
Oh, You Know, Uh,
Building The Foundation.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.800
Sorry, Ma'am,
But You Can't Park There!

17:46.200 --> 17:46.800
Hey!

17:46.800 --> 17:49.300
Hey. Ace-Man.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.300
Rocket-Man.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.900
- Whoa, You Guys Have A Handshake?
- Yeah.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.600
And Nicknames.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.700
Hey. Wanna Put Your Mitts
In The Cement Before It Dries?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.000
What For?

18:01.300 --> 18:03.700
Uh, It's A Custom.
Tradition.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.400
Come On. Let Me Show You.
You Go Right Here Next To Me.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.200
Best Part Is, Once You're Done,
It's Forever.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.000
For Real?

18:10.100 --> 18:13.000
Yeah, For Real. Ready?
Go.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.100
- Ugh! - Ugh!
- Get It, Get It, Get It.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.300
So Awesome.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.200
I Got My Paw Prints
In Foundations

18:19.200 --> 18:20.400
All Over This Town.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.800
- Now Sign It.
- Can We Do It Again?

18:30.800 --> 18:32.000
Best To My Memory,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.900
That Is Exactly
Where He Had It.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.500
Good Stuff.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.100
So When We See Owen,
You Take The Lead At First.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.400
I'm Just Gonna Lay Back
In The Cut

18:51.400 --> 18:54.200
Until We Get A Sense Of Justow
Enraged He Is With Me.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.600
All Right.
Sounds Like A Plan.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.100
Hey. Yeah,
We're On Our Way There Now.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.200
All Right, Is Cyrus
Still Working The Door?

19:04.600 --> 19:06.300
Okay, I'll Tell Him
To Keep An Eye Out For You.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.000
Yes, He Is. Ciao.
Amiquay.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.600
Which, Despite Her World Travel
And Smoking Frame,

19:14.800 --> 19:17.100
Still Doesn't Make It Right
You Saying "Ciao."

19:17.500 --> 19:19.300
She Made A Point Of Asking
If You Were Gonna Be There,

19:19.300 --> 19:21.600
And She Was Real Clucked When
I Told Her That You Would Be.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.100
Which Leads Us
To The 800-Pound Gorilla

19:26.100 --> 19:28.400
Riding Sidesaddle
On The Elephant In The Room.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.600
- Okay.
- What Exactly Went On Between
You And My Buddy's Girlfriend?

19:32.800 --> 19:34.000
Oh, You Mean,
Uh, Post-Paella?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.400
Yeah, I Mean Post-Paella.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.700
You're Meddling Again.

19:38.900 --> 19:41.200
Okay. You Tell That To
Her Boyfriend When He Finds Out.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.800
'Cause If We've Learned
One Thing--

19:42.800 --> 19:44.100
They Always Find Out.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.800
You Know, I'm Not Saying
Anything To Anyone, Nick.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.100
Just Living My Life.
Look Into It.

19:51.100 --> 19:52.100
How Do You Want It,
Eddie?

19:52.200 --> 19:53.000
What?

19:53.100 --> 19:54.700
How... Do You Want It?

19:55.100 --> 19:56.900
'Cause When I Put My Head Down

19:57.100 --> 20:00.400
- And I Stay Out Of People's Way,
I'm A Bad Guy.
- Ugh.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.400
And When I Get Involved--
I'm Sorry-mEddle, Right?

20:04.500 --> 20:05.500
That Doesn't Fly With You,
Either,

20:05.500 --> 20:07.900
So I'm Just Gonna
Pass The Baton To You.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.800
Build A Better Nick Garrett.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.400
- You Have All The Answers, Right?
- I Never Said That.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.200
- You Didn't Have To.
- Well, That Wouldn't Be The First Time

20:15.300 --> 20:17.800
You Put Words In My Mouth,
Would It, Nick?

20:17.800 --> 20:21.000
So Go On. Keep Going. What Would
My Altergo, Freddy Venetta,

20:21.000 --> 20:24.700
- Say At A Moment Like This?
- I'm Not Gonna Apologize For That Stupid Book Anymore.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.700
No, Of Course You're Not. What,
You Alreaddid Enough Of That

20:26.700 --> 20:29.000
On Your Little Apology Parade
Coming Back To The Ridge,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.700
Which, I Gotta Say,
Was Good For No One--

20:32.300 --> 20:35.800
Not For Me, Not For Owen,
And, You Know, I Can't Even

20:35.800 --> 20:38.600
Begin To Understand What You're
Doing To Hannah And Sam.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.300
What Do You Know About That?

20:41.500 --> 20:43.500
Oh, Just What We've All Known
Since Ten Years Back--

20:43.500 --> 20:47.500
That You're Not The Kid's Dad.
Gan Goddard Is The Father.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.800
And You're Just Hanging
Around The Ridge,

20:49.900 --> 20:52.000
Hoping That One Day
That Fact Will Change.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.100
But It Ain't Gonna,
And Let Me Tell You

20:54.100 --> 20:56.300
One More Thing I Do Know,
And It Sucks To Say, Nick,

20:56.300 --> 20:57.900
Considering
Where We Were Ten Years Ago,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.500
But Maybe We Can't Do This.
Maybe Too Much Time Has Passed.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.900
You Got Your Stuff,
And I Got What I Got.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.800
There's No Me And You
Anymore, Man.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.300
We're Doing A Thing Here--
Going To Bring Owen Back,

21:11.400 --> 21:13.100
But That Is The Extent of It.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.700
This Isn't A Reunion Tour.
You Copy?

21:27.400 --> 21:28.900
Nicholson Garrett--

21:29.000 --> 21:31.600
Back In The Unbreakable N.Y.C. Where You Been, Playa?

21:31.900 --> 21:33.900
How You Doing, Man? Hey, You Know, C.J. Just Got Back From Croatia.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.800
You Should Come Say, "Hey." Edward Albert Latekka!

21:39.100 --> 21:40.800
What's Happening, Brett? Oh, You Know.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.900
Burglars Always Work At Night, Chacho.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.300
Come Here, Come Here.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.000
Gentlemen, Allow Me To Introduce You

21:47.000 --> 21:48.200
To The Coolest Kid In School.

21:48.200 --> 21:51.700
This Is Edward James Latekka. Eddie, This Is Trip. How You Doing?

21:51.800 --> 21:53.300
This Over Here Is Sonja... Hi.

21:53.300 --> 21:55.800
And, Uh, I'm Pretty Sure This Is Another Sonja... Hi.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.700
And Over There We Got Vinnie Scallopini. Hey, Ed.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.400
Excuse Me. Yeah, Yeah.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.000
Ah. Iggles

22:05.700 --> 22:07.300
What The Hell Happened?

22:07.300 --> 22:10.200
Elton John Throw Up On You? Eddie.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.500
I Can't Believe You Came All The Way Down Here.

22:12.700 --> 22:15.700
Well... How You Holding Up, O?

22:16.100 --> 22:19.000
It's Hard, But... You Know,

22:19.600 --> 22:22.200
My Brother Always Has A Way Of Making Things Right.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.500
Yeah, I-I Can See That.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.000
You Know, We're Forging A New World Order With Baby Bro.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.400
Owen 2.0 Is Ready To Go To Prototype

22:28.500 --> 22:30.100
And Move On To Mass Production.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.200
Yeah, You Know, Brett,

22:32.200 --> 22:34.400
I-I Just Wanna Bring Him Back Home To His Kids.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.700
Yeah, Well, You Know, I Want An 11-Inch--Oh, Nose.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.200
Thank You, Sweetheart. Here You Go.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
Owen Is Letting Go Of The Past,

22:46.100 --> 22:48.500
And When I'm Done With B-Bro, He's Gonna Forget

22:48.500 --> 22:51.600
That The Words "Knights" And "Ridge" Ever Went Together.

22:51.700 --> 22:52.700
Okay? Cheers.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.100
Somethin' Wrong, Pop?

23:06.500 --> 23:08.900
Well...  I Can't Help Thinkin', Uh,

23:09.600 --> 23:11.800
That's A Delicate Thing, What Nick's Done--

23:12.300 --> 23:14.200
Moving Back Home After All These Years.

23:14.300 --> 23:15.200
Yeah? So?

23:15.400 --> 23:17.000
Well, I Only Hope That He Doesn't Think

23:17.000 --> 23:20.500
What We've Done--Moving His Bedroom Back And All--

23:20.500 --> 23:22.600
As Presumptuous.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.300
What, You Think It Might Scare Him Off?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.900
There's Something About Home That Kept Him Away.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.600
So What Are You Thinkin'?

23:41.000 --> 23:44.400
I'm Thinking Let's Change It Back To A Tv Room Again.

23:48.910 --> 23:48.910
我们很好 O 喝了它

24:01.700 --> 24:04.200
Hit That! Hit That! It's Sambuca. It's Herbal.

24:06.900 --> 24:10.100
Nicholson, How's The Search And Rescue Mission Going?

24:10.100 --> 24:10.900
??? good.

24:10.900 --> 24:14.300
Where's Flannel Boy? What Goes On With You Two?

24:14.300 --> 24:15.900
Why? What Did You Hear?

24:18.600 --> 24:19.800
...So Did Carl.???

24:26.800 --> 24:27.900
Hi, Eddie.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.700
I Really Thought It Was Nick. I Really Did.

24:39.700 --> 24:42.200
I Even Called Out His Name. "Nick?"

24:42.400 --> 24:43.400
I Was  That  Girl--

24:44.300 --> 24:47.900
The Girl Calling Out The Name Of The Guy Who Wasn't Even There.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.600
I Am Always That Girl When It Comes To Him.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.400
I Get That Knot In My Stomach.

24:55.300 --> 24:56.900
That Sick Feeling?

24:56.900 --> 24:59.100
Phantom Nicks-- Haunting The Ridge.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.000
Well, He Wanders Back Into Town Ten Years Later

25:03.000 --> 25:05.500
And Declares His Eternal Love, It Is So... Much?

25:05.500 --> 25:06.500
Exactly.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.100
How Do I Respond To That?

25:10.100 --> 25:12.400
A Party. Noisemakers And Funny Hats

25:12.400 --> 25:14.900
And A Banner That Reads, "At Long Last."

25:14.900 --> 25:16.800
No Way.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.400
Because Here's The Thing-- I Didn't Order Any Of This.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.900
The Questions And The Knots And The Sick Feeling?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.400
Do You Know How Relieved I Was

25:26.400 --> 25:27.700
When I Realized That Iwasn't Nick

25:27.700 --> 25:28.900
That I Saw In The Street?

25:30.500 --> 25:31.700
How Calming It Was To Remember

25:31.700 --> 25:34.200
That He Was Most Likely In New York Looking For Owen?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.600
And Then When Ray Popped Out Of Nowhere,

25:38.600 --> 25:41.000
It Just... It Just Reminded Me Of What It Felt Like.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.400
Of What Felt Like?

25:43.300 --> 25:44.700
A Nick-Garrett-Free Knights Ridge.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.200
A Nick-Garrett-Free Knights Ridge?

25:46.300 --> 25:50.000
Yep. No More Sick Feeling In My Stomach.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.300
Did You Ever Consider What The Source

25:51.300 --> 25:53.200
Of That Sick Feeling In Your Stomach Was, Hannah?

25:53.300 --> 25:54.300
Of Course I Have.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.400
Rage.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.800
Ange Fury.

26:00.800 --> 26:01.300
Okay.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.900
But How About... Love?

26:03.900 --> 26:05.200
Dude...

26:05.600 --> 26:07.600
I just ???

26:28.300 --> 26:29.600
Hey, Physical Phil.

26:33.800 --> 26:34.700
What You Up To?

26:35.200 --> 26:38.000
Just Replacing The Coaxial With The Composite Cable

26:38.000 --> 26:40.200
To See If I Can Shake Some Snow Out Of The Picture.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.300
Any Luck? Sadly... No.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.400
Maybe It's The Dish? You Want, I Should Go Up Roof

26:46.400 --> 26:47.400
And Fix It For Ya?

26:54.800 --> 26:56.000
I Don't Know What To Say.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.800
I've Been Trying To Make Sense Of Things--

26:59.800 --> 27:00.900
What I Did.

27:01.700 --> 27:02.800
It's Bad, Ikey.

27:02.800 --> 27:03.900
I Know.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.300
No, What You Gotta See, Ikey, Is This--

27:06.300 --> 27:08.100
My World Inside Tse Four Walls

27:08.100 --> 27:09.800
Is Pretty Small To Begin With.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.300
And What You Did And What I Now Have To Do--

27:12.300 --> 27:15.600
It Only Makes My World Exponentially Smaller.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.900
I'm Sorry... For All Of Us.

27:19.300 --> 27:20.100
But, Phys--

27:20.100 --> 27:21.100
No, Ikey.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.600
I'd Love To Be Switzerland Here.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.600
But You Disregarded The Sanctity Of The Pack.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.700
You Olated The Code.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.600
And For That, There Is No Absolution.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Hannah.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.450
Uh, Why Don't You Guys Get Another Round Of Shots, Okay?

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Thanks.

28:20.300 --> 28:21.200
Hey...

28:21.800 --> 28:23.300
How You Doing, Angel? Good.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.900
Remember When We Watched "The Deer Hunter" On Dvd?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.300
And You Explained How It Was About So Much More

28:38.300 --> 28:39.700
Than The Vietnam War?

28:41.200 --> 28:42.900
Yeah. Yeah, Of Course I Do.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And During The Pool Table Scene, We Sang Along

28:46.000 --> 28:48.200
To "Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You."

28:52.400 --> 28:54.500
I'd Like To Watch It With You Again Some Night.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.300
I Don't Understand.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.700
What's There Tonderstand, Ray?

29:02.600 --> 29:04.900
I'd Like To Watch It With You Again Some Night.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.800
How Do You Wanna Live With That Guy?

29:16.800 --> 29:20.600
No, I'm Kidding. He's Got Nice Hair, Though.

29:21.500 --> 29:22.300
So, Uh,

29:22.300 --> 29:23.700
What Goes On With Your Photographer?

29:23.900 --> 29:25.700
Well, Keith And I Are On A Break.

29:25.900 --> 29:27.600
It Was His Call, Not Mine.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.800
Yeah, I Don't Think That Nick Is Aware Of That, Um...

29:31.800 --> 29:32.500
The Break.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.100
Nick's Been On A Break Of His Own Lately.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.300
Owen!

29:50.000 --> 29:53.200
Owen Rowan! Owen Rowan... Whoa, Whoa, Whoa!

29:53.200 --> 29:56.300
Whoa, Whoa, Where You Think You're Going, Ding-Dong Daddy? Come On, Brett, I Just Wanna

29:56.300 --> 30:00.100
You Got Nothing To Say To Him. No. Why Are You Doing This, Man?

30:00.400 --> 30:04.100
This Isn't Owen. He's Not That Guy. He's Not You.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.800
You Wanna Hold This For A Second, Sweetheart?

30:06.300 --> 30:10.300
Judas Iscariot. You Know What That Is? Yeah, That's You.

30:10.500 --> 30:13.000
You Knew All Along, Right? And You Turned A Blind Eye.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.400
You Know, By My Rules,

30:14.500 --> 30:16.400
You May As Well Have Been In On The Action.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.400
Oh, Idn's.Beiculou You Know,

30:17.400 --> 30:20.400
You Were A Selfish Little Turd When You Were A Kid, Garrett.

30:20.400 --> 30:24.400
And You're A Selfish, Little Turd Now! At Least I'm Consistent.

30:24.600 --> 30:27.400
Whatay You And I Break Outta Here?

30:27.400 --> 30:30.100
I Know This Little Joint Down On Avenue C

30:30.100 --> 30:32.500
Where They Play Dirty Sax All Night Long.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.200
You. Me.

30:36.500 --> 30:39.500
Dirty Sax All Night Long? Yep.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.100
Listen...

30:46.100 --> 30:49.900
I-I'm Gonna Do Something A Bit Unexpected Right Now.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.800
I'm Gonna Go Call A Friend.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.400
Excuse Me.

31:04.100 --> 31:07.800
Hey. It's Me. Um...

31:07.800 --> 31:09.900
We're In N.Y.C. We--We Found Owen,

31:09.900 --> 31:11.600
And We'll Be Coming Back Soon.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.000
So You Know What Happens Now? Yeah.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.900
I'm Going Back To Knights Ridge And Taking Owen With Me.

31:15.100 --> 31:20.200
No. Wrong 'Em, Boyo. No. Now Is The Part...

31:20.200 --> 31:22.300
Where I Rear Back My Fist... Oh, Great.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.000
And I Break Your Nose... Great.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.800
And Security Drags Us Out, And The Whole Thing

31:25.800 --> 31:28.100
Gets Written Up In "Page Sixth Exd T Saturd

31:28.100 --> 31:31.600
Heco In Re And I Get My Pick Of The Waitresses In The Joint,

31:31.600 --> 31:34.500
Cause I'm The Guy That Knocked Out That Jerk

31:34.500 --> 31:35.600
That Wrote The Trendy Book.

31:35.600 --> 31:39.200
Now What Do You Think Of That, Garrett? I Think I Pity The Waitress.

31:40.700 --> 31:44.700
What Do You Say We Ease Up, Brett? Hey, Edward Thomas Latekka!

31:44.800 --> 31:46.500
You're Gonna Stick Up For This Recreant?

31:46.500 --> 31:48.300
After All The Crap He Wrote About You?

31:48.300 --> 31:50.200
Need I Remind You, Dude? Not Really.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.500
Oh, Uh, And I Quote-- Buh-Buh-Buh-Buh,

31:52.500 --> 31:55.000
"Freddy Venetta"-- That's You-- Yeah.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.200
Yeah. "Liked To Smash Things. He Was An Animal.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.900
A Blunt Instrument." Yeah.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.500
See, The Thing Of It Is, Brett...

32:04.000 --> 32:06.400
There Hasn't Been A Day Go By In The Last Ten Years

32:06.400 --> 32:08.500
I Didn't Wanna Punch Nick Garrett Square In The Face.

32:08.900 --> 32:11.600
But That Doesn't Mean I'm Gonna Stand Here And Let You Do It.

32:11.900 --> 32:13.500
What's The Matter With You, Huh?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.700
How Come Everybody's So Forgiving Of This Kid?

32:16.300 --> 32:17.600
I Don't Know, Man.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.400
Maybe It's 'Cause He's A Hell Of A Shoveler.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.000
Oh, That's Sweet. Well, You Know What?

32:24.100 --> 32:26.500
That Doesn't Work For Me. Yeah, Hey! Hey! Hey!

32:26.500 --> 32:28.300
Get Your Hands Off Of Me! And By The Way, He Was Right.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.700
Freddy Venetta Does Like To Smash Things.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.200
All Right, Eddie, Just Let It Go, Okay?

32:33.200 --> 32:36.100
Let's Get Owen. Let's Get Outta Here. Owen's Gone.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.900
I Hooked Him Up With The Magic Blonde.

32:37.900 --> 32:41.000
They Went To Her Place... To Start A New Life.

32:42.500 --> 32:43.700
Let's Go.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.900
Hey, Cyrus, Have You Seen A Big Guy?

32:50.100 --> 32:53.100
Really Ugly Shirt? End Of The Block.

32:53.100 --> 32:54.300
All Right, Thanks, Man.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.300
You Have A Good Night Now. You, Too. Thank You.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.300
Oh, There He Is.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.600
Dead Man Walkin'.

33:00.100 --> 33:02.700
All Right. Guess I'm Gonna Handle This.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.200
Huh. Have At It, Chief.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.600
What Happened To The Magic Blonde?

33:08.500 --> 33:09.900
I Put Her In A Cab.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.500
She Was Scary.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.000
Owen?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
No, Nick. No.

33:16.700 --> 33:17.900
Me And You--

33:18.700 --> 33:19.500
No.

33:22.600 --> 33:23.600
So What's The Plan, Buddy?

33:23.600 --> 33:29.400
Well, Right Now The Plan Is To Eat 25 Of These Babies.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.299
Alison Keeps Me On A Low Sodium Diet.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.000
 <I>Kept</I> Me.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.999
Which Makes No Sense,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.200
'Cause I Never Put Salt On My Hot Dogs.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.899
How Many Is That? 22.

33:41.900 --> 33:44.499
Look, Owen, I Know You Think It's Gonna Be Hard

33:44.500 --> 33:47.199
Cong Back Home, Having To Face Your Problems,

33:47.200 --> 33:50.599
People Talking About You, But Take It From Me,

33:50.600 --> 33:53.000
The Ridge Takes Care Of Its Own.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.999
And Also Take It From Me That Time

33:55.000 --> 33:57.299
Spent Away From Your Friends And Your Family--

33:57.300 --> 33:59.200
That's Time You Don't Get Back.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.999
Owen? 23.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I Was Wrong, Okay?

34:05.900 --> 34:06.799
You Know What?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.699
I Was Really, Really Wrong Not To Meddle.

34:08.699 --> 34:11.800
'Cause I Should've Known-- I Should've Known. You Should've Known What?

34:12.100 --> 34:15.600
Known That A Friend Is Someone Who Gets Into Your Kitchen,

34:15.800 --> 34:16.900
No Matter What.

34:19.900 --> 34:21.199
24.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.399
One More To Go.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.100
That's Why We're Here Right Now.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.100
Owen Rowan, To Meddle...

34:28.800 --> 34:30.199
Is To Give A Damn.

34:38.300 --> 34:39.400
All Done.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.199
What Do You Wanna Do Now, Pal?

34:44.600 --> 34:48.500
I Wanna Go Home Ansee My Babies.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.799

35:13.400 --> 35:15.099
seduce A Boy.

35:15.100 --> 35:18.300
Really? Nothing Went On With You Two?

35:18.600 --> 35:19.800
Nothing.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.299
So Please Tell Me He's Either Gay,

35:22.300 --> 35:24.399
Married Or Blind.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.499

37:47.500 --> 37:48.900
Good Luck, Chief.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.399
Come On, Man. Come On.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.600
Come On!

37:59.700 --> 38:01.100
Thanks, Man.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.600
Okay.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.300
What Are You Gonna Do Today?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.700
I'm Gonna Crash And Then, Um...

38:19.600 --> 38:21.700
I Think I'm Gonna Go See Hannah.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.900
she ???

38:26.200 --> 38:27.500
What Do You Mean?

38:28.800 --> 38:31.700
Hannah And Sam-- They Got A Life.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.900
You Coming Back Here, Blowing Things Up.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.700
 You Should Leave 'Em Alone.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.099
Except For The Fact

38:38.100 --> 38:40.100
That I Think I'm In Love With Her All Over Again.

38:41.700 --> 38:44.100
Man, That Is Good For No One, Nicky.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.599
It's Good For No One At All.

38:45.600 --> 38:48.900
Yeah, I Know, But... There It Is.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.500
There It Is.

38:51.600 --> 38:55.500
I'll Give You A Buzz? I'm Around.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.399
Woop.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.800
Woop.

39:44.700 --> 39:45.700
Hey.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.100
There He Is!

39:48.900 --> 39:51.199
So How Was Your Trip? It Was Good.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.700
Did You Find Owen? Yeah, We Did. We Did.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.999
But I'm Just So Beat. I Gotta Crash.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.100
All Right.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.399
Oh, And You Know What I Was Thinking?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.600
And, You Know, I Don't Mean To Impose,

40:02.600 --> 40:04.300
But, You Know, Since I'm Gonna Be Around,

40:05.100 --> 40:07.499
I Was Thinking Maybe It'd Be Nice If We Could...

40:07.500 --> 40:09.500
Put This Room Back To The Way It Was.

40:11.500 --> 40:14.800
Maybe? Just... Thinking Out Loud.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.500
No, Uh... No, I, Um...

40:17.700 --> 40:20.400
It's... Not A Bad Idea. Huh, Ronnie?

40:20.400 --> 40:21.299
Not A Bad Idea.

40:21.300 --> 40:25.399
Back The Way It Was? It's Not A... Bad Idea At All.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.900
Yeah, That's What I Was Thinking. Hmm.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.500
Cool.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.700
Whoa!

40:35.000 --> 40:35.999
Okay, What's Going On, Guys?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.799
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing, Nicky.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.500
It's Just Back To The Way Was.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.000
You...

40:43.100 --> 40:44.400
I'm Not Gonna Ask.

40:48.100 --> 40:48.700
Good Night.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.100
Hey, Eddie.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.800
Um, What Are You Doing Here?

41:11.600 --> 41:14.100
I Just Spent The Last Two Days With Nick.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.600
And...

41:16.400 --> 41:18.200
I Know I Might Be Meddling...

41:19.700 --> 41:21.600
But We Have To Tell Him, Hannah.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.500
You Have To. He Deserves To Know.
