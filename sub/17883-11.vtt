WEBVTT

00:09.642 --> 00:11.610
Well, it's happening.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.277
Oz sold the company,

00:12.279 --> 00:14.780
and now we're gonna be
a bunch of corporate bitches.

00:14.782 --> 00:15.681
Pfft.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.216
Cash don't work for the man,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.418
unless it's Aquaman,
'cause he rides a seahorse.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.954
You know they're untameable,
right?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.990
Fear not, my little lamb chops.
I know you're all concerned

00:24.992 --> 00:27.860
'cause we're seemingly
under "new management,"

00:27.862 --> 00:31.563
but hear my words,
nothing is going to change.

00:31.565 --> 00:36.135
Yes, there will be changes.
Great ones! Molly!

00:36.137 --> 00:37.269
Okay.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.237
In your handbooks,

00:38.239 --> 00:43.108
you'll find a list of all
the pertinent OCP perks...

00:43.110 --> 00:43.876
Get ready.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.210
Two weeks' paid vacation...

00:45.212 --> 00:46.512
How could that be?

00:46.514 --> 00:48.147
Travel coupons...

00:48.149 --> 00:49.548
Traveling? What?

00:49.550 --> 00:53.419
6% off all OCP products...

00:53.421 --> 00:54.386
Not 6!

00:54.388 --> 00:55.320
Yearly bonuses...

00:55.322 --> 00:58.290
I don't think
Aquaman gave yearly bonuses.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.794
And finally, I give you...

01:02.695 --> 01:05.764
Ricky...
Let me do it.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.599
The Java-nator!

01:07.601 --> 01:08.434
Oh, my God.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.070
This bitch makes coffee!

01:11.171 --> 01:12.337
This is literally, like,

01:12.339 --> 01:14.940
the only good thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:14.942 --> 01:19.311
My psychic was right!
Today everything changes!

01:24.884 --> 01:25.551
Shall I pour you a cup?

01:25.553 --> 01:28.854
Oh, no, thank you, sir.
I'm a decaf gal myself.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.457
Caffeine makes me
a little, "Aah!" crazy,

01:31.459 --> 01:34.093
if you can imagine such a thing. No.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.727
Wow, that, uh, that thing

01:35.729 --> 01:37.396
looks like it's getting
a little long in the tooth.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.032
Yeah, I've had this baby
since I opened this company.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.200
She may not look
like much,

01:41.202 --> 01:43.235
but she's got it
where it counts.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.544
And so the dance begins.

02:09.829 --> 02:12.464
<i>â™ª We got your back</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:16.702
Well, the, uh, transition
seems to be going smoothly.

02:16.704 --> 02:20.339
Oh, yes.
Smooth as a Ken doll.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.173
I've made the rounds

02:21.175 --> 02:23.575
and have already
gotten to know everybody.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.345
What brought you to Contra?

02:26.613 --> 02:28.180
You did.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.048
I'm your nephew.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.484
Your sister Jan's my mom?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.318
Oh, my...

02:33.320 --> 02:35.754
Remember when she got knocked up
by that loser from the cannery?

02:35.756 --> 02:40.659
Oh, my God. Whatever happened to that guy?

02:41.094 --> 02:43.395
He's still my father.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.163
How could they not love us

02:44.165 --> 02:46.398
after we buttered them up
with all those perks?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.799
Yeah, just give 'em
all the perks first...

02:47.801 --> 02:50.602
MMmm-hmm. You know, like
little spoonfuls of sugar,

02:50.604 --> 02:53.605
and, uh, well, you know what
the queen of England says,

02:53.607 --> 02:56.041
"They make
the medicine go down."

02:56.043 --> 02:56.975
Uh, no, that was actually...

02:56.977 --> 03:01.446
So that was the sugar part.
Never mind. MMmm-hmm.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.182
And now

03:03.184 --> 03:04.750
the salt.
The salt.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.785
We take away
everything they love.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.588
Yeah, well,
it's a necessary evil.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.391
So, where should we start?

03:12.393 --> 03:14.459
Well, in every horror movie,

03:14.461 --> 03:17.563
you know
who always gets it first.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.201
What's up?

03:22.203 --> 03:26.538
Listen, quick question.
Uh, what's with the skirt?

03:28.074 --> 03:30.342
It's battle dress.
I'm Perseus...

03:30.344 --> 03:32.110
Yeah.
...son of Zeus.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.045
'Course.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.146
You know, lover of women.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.013
So it's not some sort of

03:35.015 --> 03:37.983
religious garb that
I have to be tolerant of?

03:37.985 --> 03:41.386
It's from <i>Clash of the Titans.
</i> <i>Today's casual Friday.</i>

03:41.388 --> 03:44.656
But perhaps
a little too casual.

03:44.658 --> 03:45.390
Just a little bit.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.226
May we
suggest trousers...

03:47.228 --> 03:48.293
Yeah.
...made of fabric?

03:48.295 --> 03:51.797
You see, OCP has
a very strict dress code,

03:51.799 --> 03:54.833
and defying it
is grounds for termination.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.635
Like Terminator
termination?

03:56.637 --> 03:57.302
If it were up to me,

03:57.304 --> 04:01.273
we would be wearing tube tops
and butt-less chaps every day,

04:01.275 --> 04:04.009
but, you know,
dumb, old rules.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.377
Gotcha.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.179
Couldn't help but overhear.

04:07.181 --> 04:08.280
Totally respect the rules,

04:08.282 --> 04:11.984
but casual Friday is
sort of a Contra tradition.

04:11.986 --> 04:15.287
Totally,
but you're OCP now,

04:15.289 --> 04:17.155
and, uh, they don't
like gladiators.

04:17.157 --> 04:21.059
Ah, look, I totally see where you're coming from.
Yeah, well, okay, good.

04:21.061 --> 04:24.396
Keeping the kids happy
is where I'm coming from.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.165
Totally respect that,
and that is why

04:27.167 --> 04:30.502
I am giving this young boy
the corporate card

04:30.504 --> 04:32.537
so that he can
go bananas at the Republic

04:32.539 --> 04:34.373
and buy himself some
chinos and a plaid belt.

04:34.375 --> 04:38.210
Totally appreciate that gesture,
but he's gonna take my card

04:38.212 --> 04:41.246
and buy himself
an even tinier tunic.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.914
I don't know what to do!

04:42.916 --> 04:47.319
It's casual Friday!
What do you want from me?

04:49.522 --> 04:51.456
You see, you're new.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.424
Now Cash is

04:52.426 --> 04:56.528
the kind of genius that needs
to be embraced and nurtured.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.598
The force is strong with me.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.234
Oh, these magnets help.

05:02.236 --> 05:03.535
Oh!

05:04.271 --> 05:06.305
I certainly don't want
to Contradict OCP,

05:06.307 --> 05:08.907
but I think it's best
if we let his geek flag fly.

05:08.909 --> 05:09.875
What do you say?

05:09.877 --> 05:12.311
Listen, um,
I love a good costume,

05:12.313 --> 05:13.645
if you know you what I mean. Mmm.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.747
But there are rules.
I mean, you don't see me

05:15.749 --> 05:17.316
wandering around
in my Catwoman pleathers,

05:17.318 --> 05:21.553
although I would much rather
be wearing those right now.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.354
Meow.

05:22.356 --> 05:22.988
Wha... What the...

05:22.990 --> 05:25.824
I thought I took that thing out
behind the shed and shot it!

05:25.826 --> 05:28.160
Ah, I figured, if it ain't
broke, why change it?

05:28.162 --> 05:29.127
Okay, Oswald.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.731
I am not gonna argue with you
over a coffee maker. Good.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.567
I mean, I think we're
much bigger people than that.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.771
Let's just... Why don't
we let the office choose?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.308
Cam! Are you crazy?

05:45.111 --> 05:45.644
Whoa, dude.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.480
You chose a coffee?
Whose side did you pick?

05:48.482 --> 05:50.982
The short line.
It's coffee. Who cares?

05:50.984 --> 05:51.550
Oz and Ronnie!

05:51.552 --> 05:54.986
For the love of Zeus,
don't you see what's going on?

05:54.988 --> 05:55.854
What?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.591
Look! There's a war brewing
between the office gods,

05:59.593 --> 06:02.694
and us mortals are
caught in between.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.363
It's...

06:04.365 --> 06:07.032
The  <i>Clash of the Titans.</i>

06:07.100 --> 06:08.800
It's always some nerd thing
with you, huh?

06:08.802 --> 06:12.037
Yo, Cameron.
Veronica wants to see you.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.007
Hey, Veronica.
You wanted to see me?

06:16.009 --> 06:19.111
Cameron. Yeah.
Come in. Come sit.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.380
Wanted to have
a little private powwow. Shh.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.182
Oh. Uh, okay.
You want me to close the door?

06:24.184 --> 06:26.485
No, I have to leave it open,
"legally."

06:26.487 --> 06:29.588
You know, the old
sexual harassment thing.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.422
Right, yes.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.959
It's kind of a lawsuit-ish
situation for me.

06:33.961 --> 06:38.196
It's a whole
"He said, he said...

06:38.198 --> 06:40.732
"He said, she said"
kind of a thing.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.033
Wow. That's a lot.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.737
Mmm-hmm. You know whose junk
I've been checking out lately?

06:45.739 --> 06:46.538
I don't need to...

06:46.540 --> 06:51.309
Boop. Yeah. Uh-oh, better
call my sponsor.

06:51.644 --> 06:52.778
So sue me. No, don't.

06:52.780 --> 06:56.314
Uh, you know,
what I'm trying to say is

06:56.316 --> 07:00.986
I know a born leader
when I see one,

07:01.087 --> 07:02.788
and I,

07:02.790 --> 07:05.757
would like to offer you
a promotion.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.960
Executive Liaison
in charge of transitions.

07:08.962 --> 07:12.964
Wow. What is
an Executive...

07:13.166 --> 07:14.099
The thing you just said?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.402
Well, Cameron, there are a lot
of changes going on around here,

07:17.404 --> 07:21.540
some good, some great, and, uh,
I just need you to make sure

07:21.542 --> 07:23.842
that things are running
smoothly, and that,

07:23.844 --> 07:27.045
you know, you kind of report
any little hiccups back to me.

07:27.047 --> 07:32.217
- Okay.
- Comes with a key to the Executive toilette.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.185
We have one of those?

07:33.187 --> 07:35.854
Oh, yeah. Molly found it.

07:39.525 --> 07:41.159
<i>Ocupado.</i>

07:41.161 --> 07:41.760
Son of a bitch.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.929
I've been going across
the street to the gas station.

07:43.931 --> 07:48.200
Why don't you just take
some quiet time, you know,

07:49.302 --> 07:50.869
mull it over?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.104
I'm good.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.641
Oh, hey, you know,

07:56.643 --> 07:58.710
lot of coffee.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.779
I'm sorry...
Promotion?

08:00.781 --> 08:05.984
Blimey. Mate. I'm gonna have to
put a bell around your neck.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.686
There is no promotion.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.020
I specifically
heard you say the...

08:09.022 --> 08:10.155
You know,
here in the colonies,

08:10.157 --> 08:13.658
we have a little thing
we like to call manipulation.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.593
I mean, I'm not proud of it,

08:14.595 --> 08:18.430
but every change I try to make
gets blocked by Oz.

08:18.432 --> 08:22.234
I need an inside man.
Oh, in so many ways.

08:22.236 --> 08:22.734
Oh, I see.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.270
So you're getting Cameron on
side so the others will follow.

08:25.272 --> 08:30.008
Oh, that's fine. You know,
you're such an inspirational...

08:30.010 --> 08:31.710
That is cute.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.513
Oh,
that's actually engraved...

08:34.647 --> 08:36.815
By my mother?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.123
Hey, uh,
top of the day, Cameron.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.793
Uh, hey there, Mr. Monopoly.
What's with the getup?

08:48.795 --> 08:51.396
Our new boss.
She's a Terminatrix.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.397
Ronnie wants us
to go corporate,

08:52.399 --> 08:54.833
so I'll wear a suit.
That's what I'll do.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.735
'Cause I love OCP.

08:57.371 --> 09:01.940
Just as much as I love
coconut water and racquetball.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.308
Okay, dude, you're not
being corporate.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.010
You're just doing
your white guy voice.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.212
It's offensive,
and just so you know,

09:07.214 --> 09:09.781
coconut water
is very hydrating.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.251
Hey, Oz, uh, we gotta talk.

09:13.253 --> 09:13.952
Hold on, hold on.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.555
Ohh. Just getting
a head massage.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.190
Okay, look, I had this
bizarre meeting with Veronica,

09:19.192 --> 09:21.092
and she wants me to...

09:21.094 --> 09:21.626
Do it!

09:21.628 --> 09:23.628
No.
I don't think you understand.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.097
She offered me...
Excellent!

09:26.099 --> 09:27.532
You're not even
listening, okay?

09:27.534 --> 09:30.235
I don't need to,
Mr. Executive Liaison

09:30.237 --> 09:33.238
Coordinator
in charge of transitions.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.774
How do you know that?
That just happened.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.076
Not only is this
a heavenly head massager.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.478
It doubles as
a sonic listening device.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.680
Sonic listening device?

09:41.682 --> 09:44.316
Why can't this office
just be normal?

09:44.318 --> 09:45.317
The good news is,
now I am privy

09:45.319 --> 09:47.419
to Ronnie's little "He said,
she said" legal woes,

09:47.421 --> 09:50.288
I'm gonna use that to restore
the balance of power

09:50.290 --> 09:52.457
in this office.
Are you in?

09:52.459 --> 09:53.158
No! No, I just...

09:53.160 --> 09:56.595
I don't want to be caught
in the middle of anything.

09:56.597 --> 09:56.995
Please?

09:56.997 --> 10:00.165
No. I'm not doing it.
No way. No.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.569
This is your plan?
Using me as harassment bait?

10:04.571 --> 10:05.203
I'm not a boy toy.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.373
Time to shake your can.
Target's on your six.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.654
Oh.

10:22.989 --> 10:23.722
Cameron.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.791
I hope you won't take this
the wrong way, but...

10:26.793 --> 10:28.126
Well, hello.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.029
S'up?
You like what you see?

10:31.031 --> 10:31.696
Really?

10:31.698 --> 10:34.332
A mouthful of peanut butter?
You're killing me!

10:34.334 --> 10:38.670
<i>The peanut butter has</i>
<i>many different uses.</i>

10:38.672 --> 10:42.240
It's one of
the most versatile

10:43.242 --> 10:43.975
butters.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.112
Check that! It's working! She's
on the hook! Reel her in!

10:47.114 --> 10:49.114
I need some milk.
<i>No, no. No.</i>

10:49.116 --> 10:52.117
Hold your position.
Hold your position.

10:52.119 --> 10:52.651
I wanna go home.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.886
I gotta go. I can't do this.
I wanna go home.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.955
That's genius!
You're presenting.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.290
I feel really weird.
<i>Don't move.</i>

10:59.292 --> 11:00.191
She's on the approach.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.260
<i>I can't</i>
<i>stick it out any further.</i>

11:02.262 --> 11:04.663
<i>These pants are so tight.</i>

11:07.733 --> 11:10.001
Nice try, Oswald.

11:11.470 --> 11:11.970
Abort. Abort!

11:11.972 --> 11:15.607
<i>Look!</i> <i>You want a war?</i> <i>It is on!</i>

11:15.609 --> 11:18.476
<i>It is on like</i> Donkey Kong!

11:19.245 --> 11:23.848
Listen, Oprah, it's all gonna
come back. Everything's...

11:25.017 --> 11:26.317
I'll call you right back.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.220
No!
Don't take the video games!

11:29.222 --> 11:31.389
Oz, do something!

11:31.391 --> 11:32.691
They killed Dug!

11:32.693 --> 11:34.426
Who's Doug?
<i>Dig Dug!</i>

11:36.096 --> 11:37.462
Aah!

11:38.631 --> 11:40.865
Damn it.
Stupid cubicle cage.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.301
Hey, Mel,
do you have a napkin?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.537
No Melanie.
Veronica moved her.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.305
Didn't want you guys
distracting each other.

11:47.307 --> 11:51.076
But... We always sit together.
That's our thing.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.944
Well, it could be
our thing.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.080
Oh, this is bad.

11:55.082 --> 11:59.284
I can't believe they touched
the Captain Kirk chair.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.754
What in the name of
the prime directive is this?

12:02.756 --> 12:05.957
Oh. I took your office. Yay!

12:05.959 --> 12:07.959
Nobody touches the chair!

12:07.961 --> 12:09.994
Oh, I touched it, all right.

12:09.996 --> 12:14.232
Yeah. I put my dirty
little fingies all over it,

12:14.234 --> 12:15.700
and I loved it.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.104
Just throw it all out.

12:19.106 --> 12:23.608
Cast out of Mount Olympus.
The gods have spoken!

12:23.909 --> 12:26.077
Just let it go.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.781
Push the button.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.049
Fill her up.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.984
It's just that easy.

12:32.986 --> 12:36.254
Mmm.
What an aroma.

12:36.355 --> 12:40.091
Do you need anything notarized?
I got a certificate.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.861
It's kind of an honor.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.265
I'm good. Thank you. Yeah.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.035
This place is going to hell.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.070
They put key cards
on all the doors

12:52.072 --> 12:53.605
so they'll know
when we're late.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.606
Wait.
Why are you wearing that?

12:54.608 --> 12:57.208
Because these fluorescent
lights make me look hideous.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.777
Come on.
You could never look...

13:00.180 --> 13:01.913
Oh!

13:02.281 --> 13:02.781
Dick.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.250
I didn't... Oh... Hello?

13:05.252 --> 13:07.986
Hey. It's me.
Don't turn around.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.421
I said, don't turn around!

13:10.423 --> 13:11.222
We're kicking off plan "B,"

13:11.224 --> 13:13.091
and Veronica can't know you
and I are still in cahoots.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.560
Say you just closed
the Johnson account.

13:15.562 --> 13:16.294
<i>Say it! Say it loud!</i>

13:16.296 --> 13:19.063
I just closed
the Johnson account?

13:19.065 --> 13:22.867
Holy crap. That's awesome.
Always be closing!

13:24.671 --> 13:25.737
Oz, we are not in cahoots.
All right?

13:25.739 --> 13:28.840
This is just like when my parents got divorced.
They used me as a pawn.

13:28.842 --> 13:32.243
It's why I locked myself in my room
with my computer for five years.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.012
You want to talk about it?
No.

13:34.014 --> 13:34.913
Let's get back to the plan.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.214
No. No plans. You lost.
Just admit it.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.783
You sold the company. It's not yours.
Things will change.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.585
Oh, yeah.
Things are about to change.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.388
Veronica's about to
switch from decaf to caf.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.522
Say "hello" to El Injerto

13:44.524 --> 13:47.091
from the Huehuetenango
region of Guatemala.

13:47.093 --> 13:50.995
The strongest coffee
on Earth. Observe.

13:51.897 --> 13:52.263
Whoa.

13:52.265 --> 13:56.267
<i>Caffeine makes me</i>
<i>a little, "Aah!" crazy.</i>

13:56.969 --> 13:58.536
Who's up for Vegas?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.371
No, no, no.
No, screw that.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.607
Everybody goes to Vegas.
Let's go to Reno.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.443
Veronica, please?

14:12.351 --> 14:13.551
What? What happened?

14:13.553 --> 14:15.687
What? Hey! Oh! It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.723
Everything is fine.
Well, it's not fine.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.725
Actually,
it was rather terrifying,

14:20.727 --> 14:23.061
but the good news is
no one was hurt.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.997
Well, one person was hurt,
actually, quite severely.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.932
Ow.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.134
Ow.

14:31.570 --> 14:32.303
Ow.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.673
What? What's going...
That was my office.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.242
No, no! Not anymore,

14:37.244 --> 14:39.510
and I've got the paperwork
that says it's mine.

14:39.512 --> 14:43.414
Got your little Ronnie Hancock
right there. Hmm?

14:43.416 --> 14:45.116
I don't remember signing this.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.918
Yes, you had
a little bit of an episode.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.453
Yeah. Yeah, it was
pretty psychotic.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.922
It's all settled. Let's go to Dubai. Yeah.

14:50.924 --> 14:51.589
I'll fuel the jet.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.225
Right.
I'll call my jet pack guy.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.793
Okay, and you'll
give me my office back?

14:55.795 --> 14:58.363
I will, I will!
Wait, hold on one second.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.697
I'm getting a call.
Sure.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.366
Hello?

15:01.368 --> 15:03.268
You know, I probably
should have told you

15:03.270 --> 15:05.103
that we were out of decaf.

15:05.105 --> 15:05.637
Guess what?

15:05.639 --> 15:08.306
That signature's not gonna hold
up in a court of law, you big...

15:08.308 --> 15:11.476
That's why I had
your guy notarize it!

15:11.610 --> 15:13.912
Ha, ha!
Take good care of her!

15:13.914 --> 15:16.814
Whoo-hoo! Hey, boys!
Looking good.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.783
Guess who's got
his office back?

15:18.785 --> 15:21.953
Well, goody for him.
What do we got?

15:21.955 --> 15:22.553
Nothin'.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.089
And it's gonna get even
crazier around here.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.860
It's the <i>Wrath of the Titans.</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

15:28.862 --> 15:31.162
We're gonna get
in the middle.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.699
Okay, Ladyhawke's flying.

15:34.701 --> 15:38.970
Operation Peace Talks are a go.
Okay, Mel, you're up.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.438
<i>Morning, Vee.</i>

15:40.440 --> 15:40.805
<i>Wow.</i>

15:40.807 --> 15:42.974
<i>I love that dress.</i>
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

15:42.976 --> 15:44.142
All right, nice.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.009
Ooh, what can I do you for?

15:45.011 --> 15:47.278
Uh, Oz wants to see you
in his office.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.815
Oh, great.
Wow.

15:51.984 --> 15:52.951
Got it.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.620
Okay, her key card's in pocket.
Oz is on the move.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.422
That's all you, Cash.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.593
Hey. Boss. I just saw Ronnie
snooping around in your office.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.163
Good to have you
on the team, kid.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.468
What was that?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.036
A pat on the back.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.038
Little higher.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.242
Yes.

16:18.244 --> 16:18.776
Shh.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.913
You didn't
see a thing! Shh!

16:23.582 --> 16:27.852
Hey. What'd you do? Come here
to gloat about your glory day?

16:27.854 --> 16:30.421
Oh, great. Is that why
you summoned me here?

16:30.423 --> 16:31.622
So you can make fun of me?

16:31.624 --> 16:34.459
I didn't ask... We've got to
get out of here! Come on!

16:34.461 --> 16:35.393
- What?
- Ugh!

16:35.395 --> 16:37.729
We locked you both in, just like
the judge did with my parents.

16:37.731 --> 16:40.398
He made them sit in a room and
talk to each other like adults.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.769
And if you don't, we'll pump
poisonous gas in there.

16:46.638 --> 16:47.305
We scrap that?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.842
I'll get us out of here.
Wait. Where's my...

16:51.410 --> 16:53.011
Oh, what?

16:53.013 --> 16:55.646
Ho, ho. Don't worry
about it, Veronica.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.383
My pockets are unpickable.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.985
Keep swiping.

17:02.888 --> 17:05.590
Demagnetized your key card.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.959
Jedi power activate.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.866
Keep... Keep
doing your thing.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.868
Okay, there has to be
some way outta here.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.704
There isn't. This place
is built like a bunker.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.471
It's the perfect plan.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.073
Unless we do
exactly what they say,

17:22.075 --> 17:25.076
one of us is gonna
have to eat the other.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.044
Well...

17:26.046 --> 17:29.047
We got all day.
Start talkin'.

17:34.653 --> 17:35.953
This is absurd.

17:35.955 --> 17:38.089
It's been hours.
They need nourishment.

17:38.091 --> 17:41.759
I had a snake that lasted
six weeks without food.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.428
How long is this
gonna drag on, man?

17:43.430 --> 17:46.998
Shouldn't somebody
go in there and mediate?

17:50.202 --> 17:51.969
We can sit here
until hell freezes over,

17:51.971 --> 17:55.873
but the office is a nonstarter.
No compromise!

17:55.875 --> 18:02.146
Well, is there anything at all
on the table that is negotiable?

18:02.581 --> 18:04.348
Anything.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.485
Okay.

18:07.786 --> 18:08.519
The Oz-spresso machine,

18:08.521 --> 18:11.255
but only because my coffee
tastes like a bag of ass.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.991
- Get it.
- Thank you.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.360
Veronica.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.930
I'll give up
fluorescent lighting.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.833
I'll be doing
that Melanie girl a favor.

18:21.835 --> 18:22.467
No more cubicles.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.735
Fine. Key cards.
Unlimited office supplies.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.571
Corporate retreats.
Staples Center box seats.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.738
Weekly status report.
Doggie daycare.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.208
Two personal items per cubicle.
Build your own taco bar.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.075
Robot battles.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.177
All right.
I'll give up Nerf weapons.

18:33.179 --> 18:37.348
No! I want casual Fridays.
I wear the skirts around here!

18:37.350 --> 18:40.151
I can't do that to Cash.
It's all he has.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.185
It's all the kid's got.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.088
Why are you fighting
for distractions?

18:44.090 --> 18:47.859
What you call distractions,
I call motivators.

18:47.861 --> 18:51.129
Oswald, people are not

18:51.131 --> 18:52.964
working.

18:55.767 --> 18:59.904
You are forcing me to do
something I don't want to do.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.909
Oh, my God.
What's happening?

19:05.677 --> 19:07.445
What is it?

19:07.913 --> 19:10.214
What?

19:10.216 --> 19:13.651
You're not just gonna
fork over your office to me.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.453
What do I have to
give you in return?

19:15.455 --> 19:17.388
It's not me.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.390
It's them.

19:19.392 --> 19:23.494
You want my office?
You give them theirs back.

19:24.229 --> 19:25.563
Release the kraken!

19:25.565 --> 19:27.965
<i>Here's the thing,</i>
<i>Veronica,</i>

19:27.967 --> 19:29.700
<i>if you want our best,</i>

19:29.702 --> 19:32.436
<i>you have to let us be us.</i>

19:34.907 --> 19:36.407
<i>We'll never be</i>
<i>corporate drones</i>

19:36.409 --> 19:40.044
<i>that you can cage in</i>
<i>with your cubicles.</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:44.749
<i>Cash needs his costumes</i>
<i>and his video games.</i>

19:44.751 --> 19:48.819
<i>Cameron needs</i> <i>to awkwardly
flirt</i> <i>with Melanie.</i>

19:50.789 --> 19:54.292
These are the things
that make Contra Contra.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.895
I cannot have OCP
taking all that away.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.733
That's lovely.
Just pop it there.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.602
Thank you. Thank you.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.305
Just in the left, thanks.
Lovely.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.773
Hey.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.640
Oh, hi.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.709
Thanks for helping us out.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.644
Sure. Um...

20:13.845 --> 20:16.647
Do you think we could
get a <i>Ms. Pac-man?</i>

20:16.649 --> 20:19.517
Molly!
I never said that.

20:22.020 --> 20:23.754
Told you nothing would
change around here.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.123
Well... You kind of
lost your office.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.327
Yeah, I've never really
been much of a gambler.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.965
Or am I?

20:37.302 --> 20:38.936
What the hell is this?

20:38.938 --> 20:41.572
What the hell is what?

give up anything.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.853
I'll allow it.
