15:53.456 --> 15:55.568
Yeah, I've been staring
at this thing for a week,

15:55.651 --> 15:57.886
and I still have no clue
what it means.

Is that supposed to be me?

If so,
then I guess the girl's you.

16:03.384 --> 16:05.051
But what's she looking at,
anyway?

[ Gasps ] Hey!

16:07.777 --> 16:08.926
Kind of like <i>you</i> were

16:09.003 --> 16:10.849
when we met in the study room
at the library.

16:11.128 --> 16:12.431
Oh, wait!

This floating crown
thing --

is that, like,
when I got prom king?

16:16.133 --> 16:17.568
Yeah. See, it's --

Ha! I'm totally
getting this now.

The fish
from when we went to that lake.

'cause it was fall when we met.

What's that about?

16:27.393 --> 16:30.194
Unless...
it's not an acorn.

16:30.279 --> 16:32.450
It's... a football
with snow on it!

16:32.596 --> 16:34.407
It's the night we kissed
after the game

16:34.498 --> 16:35.819
when I scored four touchdowns!

16:35.891 --> 16:37.565
Boom!
I'm on a roll!

16:37.666 --> 16:39.870
Okay, so, if all that stuff
happened to us,

16:39.986 --> 16:42.181
then we are...

in opposite directions and --

Axl, look, you'll always hold
a special place in my life.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.878
I just don't want a boyfriend
800 miles away.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.863
And the truth is, Axl,

17:04.993 --> 17:07.276
you don't want a girlfriend,
either.

17:07.438 --> 17:09.540
That would really suck.

17:09.973 --> 17:11.529
You should have fun.

17:11.868 --> 17:13.808
You should make so many memories
in college,

17:13.968 --> 17:16.823
you'll need a hundred paintings
to hold them all.

17:16.919 --> 17:18.493
[ Chuckles ] Yeah.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.189
Okay. I get it.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.299

Well, Kenny, I finally get art.

17:39.203 --> 17:39.943
[ Inhales deeply ]

17:40.026 --> 17:41.172
Art hurts.

17:46.363 --> 17:47.379
Whew. My God.

17:47.469 --> 17:48.455
Three days, and it still smells

17:48.535 --> 17:50.226
like a cologne factory
out there.

17:50.312 --> 17:53.668
I swear -- I hosed Brick off,
made him bathe in tomato juice,

17:53.756 --> 17:55.394
rubbed him down
with odor-eaters,

17:55.520 --> 17:56.656
and still, any room he's in

17:56.733 --> 17:59.223
immediately becomes
a European nightclub.

17:59.345 --> 18:02.503
And, by the way, shouldn't <i>you</i>
<i>be handling the boy hygiene?</i>

18:02.577 --> 18:03.980
Why am <i>I dealing with this?</i>

at coaching the soccer team?

You know how many e-mails
I got today? 27.

I haven't gotten 27 e-mails
in my life.

18:13.487 --> 18:14.305
One dad actually sent me

18:14.394 --> 18:16.630
a spreadsheet
of his daughter's playing time.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.459
Jordan went on for five pages
about how I hurt her feelings

18:19.560 --> 18:21.748
when I asked her
to pick up cones after practice.

18:21.864 --> 18:24.092
And Nikki wants to miss
next week's game

- whatever that is.
- Geez.

I'll tell you what else. I think
I was right about Bill Norwood.

18:31.146 --> 18:32.714
I think he knew
this was Team Crazytown,

18:32.822 --> 18:34.063
and he dumped them on me.

18:34.143 --> 18:35.975
I swear, the other day,
I saw him in his van

18:36.076 --> 18:37.853
in the parking lot
watching practice.

18:37.941 --> 18:38.644
Ugh.

I'm sorry.
Parents are lunatics.

So, is Sue getting
any playing time?

so good for her self-esteem.
