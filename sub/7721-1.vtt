Vietnam if I ever saw one.

05:22.836 --> 05:25.912
That's why I'm goin' to Hunter College.
You goddam right.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.036

06:02.466 --> 06:04.503
Came in, seen my dick,

06:29.606 --> 06:32.280
Seems like you hear my truck

06:32.408 --> 06:36.087
Well, uh, morning

06:36.211 --> 06:39.410
You should, uh, try workin'
on your first boyfriend.

06:40.894 --> 06:43.284
I'm too busy studyin'
to be worryin' about boys.

06:45.417 --> 06:47.615

08:57.275 --> 08:59.314
Put that in Brooklyn

08:59.438 --> 09:02.430

Oh, yeah.

09:31.141 --> 09:34.612
- Aw, shit!
- Oh, man, Kirby.

09:34.744 --> 09:37.419
Made me miss my shot.

09:37.547 --> 09:39.344
You know these motherfuckers down South.

09:39.467 --> 09:42.699
I wonder if half the time
they believe what they be sayin'.

09:42.828 --> 09:44.660
What's a nigger gonna do?

09:46.271 --> 09:48.549
We got blood in this land
from slaves.

09:48.633 --> 09:51.594
Been to war. Spilt our blood.
Shit, I been to war. I spilt blood.

09:51.715 --> 09:53.673
Ha! That's right.
Tell 'em, Kirby.

09:53.798 --> 09:55.869
You over there fightin' in Korea.

09:55.957 --> 09:59.397
That's how I got this plastic-ass leg.
Nicky, fix me a drink.

09:59.482 --> 10:01.917
Ko-motherfuckin'- rea.

10:06.687 --> 10:08.806
Damn! Mmm!

10:08.929 --> 10:10.967
Never gonna give you up

10:11.050 --> 10:13.326
That's why I had to leave that
motherfucker, because if I'd have...

10:13.412 --> 10:15.928
If I'd have still been down there,
I'd have killed me a motherfucker.

10:16.014 --> 10:19.772
Man, shit ain't gonna change.
What make you think shit gonna change?

10:19.897 --> 10:22.332
Nigger, what's your little
narrow ass doin' up in here, man?

10:24.339 --> 10:27.095
Leave that boy alone

10:27.181 --> 10:31.384
Aw, Kirby, man, you know he too

Oh, I know you out

11:23.145 --> 11:25.261
Yeah, at least I will

11:25.345 --> 11:27.816
People that owe me money don't pay me,

11:32.350 --> 11:35.390
Man, will you get the fuck off

11:41.317 --> 11:44.312
Ain't no goddam business

11:50.282 --> 11:52.321
Ooh, missed it by that much.

11:52.405 --> 11:55.366

Hey, that's a good game, Cowboy.

12:13.021 --> 12:15.058
You're a lucky motherfucker,

12:16.944 --> 12:19.937
Aw, I wouldn't say luck,
but, you know.

12:20.065 --> 12:22.741

Well, you know, I try.

13:45.568 --> 13:50.169
But, uh, you better be cool.
Don't let your mom and pop find out.

13:50.254 --> 13:52.244
Oh, no way.
I won't do that.

13:58.378 --> 14:00.177
It's for you.

14:01.501 --> 14:05.703
Oh, man. Whoa!

14:05.784 --> 14:08.300
- Hey, thanks, Kirby.

Say, uh, Kirby, where we goin'?

A run. Okay. All right.

14:36.287 --> 14:39.405
- Wanna drive, kid?

Aw, shit. Fuck the dumb shit.
You wanna drive or what?

16:20.283 --> 16:22.674

16:34.734 --> 16:38.525
- Come on. Come on!

16:49.825 --> 16:53.299
And hold her in my arms

16:53.388 --> 16:55.426
Now when I kiss her lips

16:55.549 --> 16:58.545

- You did good, kid.

16:58.672 --> 17:00.869
You're almost as good
a getaway driver as me.

17:00.995 --> 17:04.351
Uh, thanks. Say, uh...

17:04.435 --> 17:06.791
So you were a getaway driver, huh?

17:10.839 --> 17:14.313
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What? Wh-What's wrong?

17:14.405 --> 17:16.794
- I oughta go back there and kill that bastard.
- Why? What happened?

17:16.925 --> 17:19.122
Motherfucker made me lose
a whole pack of cigarettes.

17:19.249 --> 17:22.482
A pack of cigarettes?
A pack of cigarettes?

17:22.608 --> 17:25.763
I thought maybe you should be
worried about your leg or somethin'.

17:25.891 --> 17:29.649
- Oh, that shit's funny to you, huh?
- No, no, it's not funny.

17:29.735 --> 17:31.568
I tell you what. The next time
the motherfucker grabs me by...

17:31.656 --> 17:34.890
the wrong leg, I'm gonna use it to kick
his ass between his shoulder blades.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.135
- Hey, man, you really did that sucker.
- Yeah, everybody in town...

17:39.222 --> 17:41.455
know I got one leg, and that
motherfucker grab the wrong one.

17:41.585 --> 17:44.544
Me and Kirby, baby. Yeah.

17:50.631 --> 17:54.261
- This is wonderful news, Edward.
- Thank you.

17:54.392 --> 17:58.105
All right, all right.
You see, Anthony?

17:58.235 --> 18:01.470
You be thankful you can go to City
College on the financial aid programme.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.394
Yeah, in four years,
you can be just like me.

18:08.084 --> 18:10.394
Just like you?

18:10.524 --> 18:14.122
You can graduate and maybe even
go to graduate school too.

18:15.569 --> 18:18.448
Well, I'll tell y'all one thing.
My mama sure would've been proud.

18:18.572 --> 18:21.885
Never would've believed
I got two college graduates.

18:25.056 --> 18:27.412
You think about what
you're gonna major in, baby?

18:29.580 --> 18:31.813
The Marine Corps.
Uh, Dad, could you pass the salt?

18:31.901 --> 18:34.465
What'd you say?

18:35.705 --> 18:40.258
Thanks. I said
the, uh, Marine Corps.

18:40.348 --> 18:42.226
- I'm... I'm joinin'.
- Marine Corps?

18:42.310 --> 18:46.100
- Yeah.
- Now that's original.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.070
What you talkin' about, Anthony?

18:48.193 --> 18:51.187
I'm talkin' about
I wanna do somethin' else.

18:51.275 --> 18:54.553
I don't wanna go to college.

18:54.638 --> 18:57.393
I'm sick of school.

18:57.521 --> 19:02.232
I mean, I don't know why everybody
got this strange look on their face.

19:02.322 --> 19:05.681
- It's my life.
- Yeah.

19:05.806 --> 19:07.604
It's your life.

19:09.129 --> 19:12.044
Looks like to me
you're tryin' to ruin it, baby.

19:17.295 --> 19:19.093
You're an idiot.
You know that?

19:23.098 --> 19:27.415
Dad, I don't wanna go to college.
I'm just not ready for no college.

19:29.384 --> 19:33.539
You always said the marines and fightin'
over in Korea made a man out of you.

19:35.948 --> 19:38.668
I figure I be, you know,
livin' my own life.

19:40.832 --> 19:43.108
I'll talk to your mama.

19:55.322 --> 19:58.682
When your baby and you are tight
and everything is right

19:58.807 --> 20:00.797
- And you is mellow
- Give me that.

20:00.926 --> 20:03.238
There you go.
Now, drink some wine.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.241
You keep everything all right

20:05.370 --> 20:08.011
And you know that
you're the only fellow

20:10.375 --> 20:12.171
Ain't that a groove

20:14.057 --> 20:15.936
Ain't that a groove

20:17.740 --> 20:19.698
Ain't that a groove

20:19.822 --> 20:21.700
Told your little ass
you couldn't drink with me.

20:21.783 --> 20:24.252
- Ain't that a groove
- Hey, James. Want some of this?

20:24.384 --> 20:26.501
- Now, lookee here, fella
- Yeah! Whoo!

20:26.586 --> 20:30.103
Girls like to be in the mood
whenever they think their man is yellow

20:30.228 --> 20:33.224
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Hit me, baby

20:34.751 --> 20:38.110
Say, Skeeter, I still can't
believe you graduated, man.

20:38.236 --> 20:41.195
- Man, shut up.
- Glad we out of school, man.

20:41.277 --> 20:43.668
I'm sick of these
stupid-ass brothers.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.711
I'm about to get
my pimp thing on started.

20:45.838 --> 20:48.276
You know, I got so many ho's now, man,
I gotta get an assistant pimp...

20:48.404 --> 20:51.282
just to keep in track of 'em, you know,
make sure they on the right streets and shit.

20:51.364 --> 20:55.120
Say, Skippy, why... why you always talkin'
about this pimp stuff, man? What's happenin'?

20:55.207 --> 20:57.927
'Cause it's real, man. I'm a pimp.
Pimpin' run in my family.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.565
My great-great granddaddy was a slave,
and he was a pimp.

21:00.652 --> 21:04.250
He used to have his ho's pick his cotton
in the field. He didn't have to do shit.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.690
You better be careful, man. You're
gonna catch something, Skip. Watch.

21:06.815 --> 21:09.697
That's all right, motherfucker. I was
born by the pussy, I'll die by the pussy.

21:09.778 --> 21:11.611
Don't worry about
what the fuck I do.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.532
Hey, Skip, do you
believe in superstition?

21:13.621 --> 21:16.295
Hell, no.

21:16.382 --> 21:20.937
Well, you should, man.
Your stupid ass jinxed me.

21:21.066 --> 21:24.584
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- Uncle Sam, man.

21:24.669 --> 21:27.664
Dropped a motherfuckin' 1-A on me.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.583
I told you, didn't I?
Didn't I tell you?

21:29.672 --> 21:31.983
- Say, when did that happen?
- Last week, Anthony, man.

21:32.114 --> 21:34.790
Yeah, right, motherfucker.
Pass the joint.

21:37.199 --> 21:39.157
- Anthony, man.
- What?

21:39.240 --> 21:42.552
You know that, um,
that me and Marisol, we tight, man.

21:42.643 --> 21:44.760
Yeah, man, y'all are...
Y'all pretty down.

21:44.844 --> 21:46.962
- You would say I love her?
- I don't know.

21:47.086 --> 21:48.964
I could say that you love her.

21:49.047 --> 21:51.562
- I'm thinkin' about marrying her, man.
- Oh, wait a minute.

21:51.690 --> 21:55.652
- Hey, don't do that shit.
- Hey, man, you might be goin' a little too fast now.

21:55.731 --> 22:00.172
Hey, I love her, man, and did you see
how she looks today at that party, man?

22:00.297 --> 22:03.370
- She looks good enough to marry.
- I'm glad to hear you want me.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.497
What you over here
talkin' about, Anthony?

22:08.621 --> 22:11.581
- Why you standin' over here?
- Shut up, Skippy. - Shut up.

22:14.665 --> 22:18.105
Anthony, I know you ain't gonna stay over
here talkin' to Skip while my song's playin'.

22:18.188 --> 22:20.785
Not if they expect to be
with us tonight.

22:22.672 --> 22:24.664
- Look here, Skippy, we gonna have to cut on out, bro.
- Uh, yeah.

22:24.793 --> 22:26.990
- Man, where y'all goin'?
- Uh, we gonna go hang on out.

22:27.115 --> 22:29.073
- Look it, have some chicken. - I thought we
was hangin', man. - Have some chicken, man.

22:29.197 --> 22:32.395
I told you about them broads,
old punk-ass.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.990
And anyway, Skip,
Brenda lookin' for you.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.596
I don't give a fuck. You tell her I'm
at where I at and I'll be where I be.

22:38.684 --> 22:42.805
Motherfuckin' pimp. If I gotta go where
every ho want me to be, I be confused.

22:42.927 --> 22:44.966
Motherfucker. Tell her
don't make me hurt my hand again.

22:45.049 --> 22:51.605
If you want a do-right all day

22:51.734 --> 22:53.531
Woman

22:55.978 --> 22:59.859
You gotta be a do-right

22:59.940 --> 23:01.660
All night

23:01.780 --> 23:04.581
Jose, I love you.

23:06.784 --> 23:09.459
I love you too, mama.

23:09.547 --> 23:12.109
If you give my pussy away
to somebody else...

23:12.229 --> 23:14.106
while I'm gone...

23:14.190 --> 23:17.549
I'm gonna come back
and blow that motherfucker up.

23:18.672 --> 23:21.826
I got this itch
I need to be scratched.

23:27.641 --> 23:32.035
S- S-S-So... So you're sayin'
that y-your, your mama...

23:32.123 --> 23:33.956
is workin' a night shift tonight?

23:34.044 --> 23:37.357
Mm-hmm.
And you know what else?

23:37.488 --> 23:40.209
You could scratch it
all night long if you want to.

23:43.651 --> 23:47.091
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.
You know I'm the nigger. I'm the nigger.

23:47.253 --> 23:49.565
You swear Big Bertha
won't get off work early?

23:49.696 --> 23:52.656
She's not gonna get off
from work early.

23:52.777 --> 23:54.850
- You scared?
- No, I ain't scared. I just don't...

23:54.980 --> 23:57.450
You act like you're scared.
Come on. Shut up.

23:58.543 --> 24:00.660
- Where Delilah at?
- She in her room. Come on!

24:05.588 --> 24:08.582
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

24:08.710 --> 24:10.589
- Get out.
- Say it loud

24:10.712 --> 24:13.388
- I'm black and I'm proud
- Go to your own room.

24:13.474 --> 24:17.311
- Say it loud
- I'm black and I'm proud

24:21.839 --> 24:25.801
Once upon a time
I almost lost my mind

24:25.923 --> 24:27.483
I was lonely

24:30.046 --> 24:33.485
So lonely

24:33.609 --> 24:36.329
Once upon a time

24:37.772 --> 24:40.448
Oh, Juanita.

24:40.535 --> 24:42.810
Look, it's okay.

24:42.894 --> 24:45.811
It's all right.
It's okay.

24:45.940 --> 24:48.611
- Okay. Okay.
- Let me get your bra.

24:48.699 --> 24:50.534
- Okay.
- Let me get it.

24:53.222 --> 24:56.696
- Ow. Just unhook it. Just unhook the...
- I can't. I can't.

24:56.826 --> 24:59.787
I'll get it.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

24:59.868 --> 25:02.020
- Okay. Okay.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:02.111 --> 25:05.662
Don't peek. Don't look at...
Don't look at me. Okay.

25:05.793 --> 25:08.263
Okay. Okay.

25:10.358 --> 25:12.154
- Oh!
- What?

25:12.278 --> 25:16.513
That's not it.
Up, up, up, up. Higher. Ow.

25:16.641 --> 25:19.077
- That's too high. Wait. Down, down.
- Okay, wait.

25:19.203 --> 25:22.083
- Right there? Okay.
- Yeah.

25:22.206 --> 25:25.438
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

25:25.566 --> 25:29.484
- It's okay.
- Uh-oh. Wait.

25:29.609 --> 25:33.845
Okay. Easy. Ow!

25:33.974 --> 25:35.772
Ah!

26:01.034 --> 26:04.745
Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait.

26:04.877 --> 26:08.429
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

26:08.559 --> 26:11.074
- Okay.
- Baby.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.362
You know, Marisol and Jose
goin' down to city hall tomorrow.

26:14.484 --> 26:16.920
Oh, yeah? What for?

26:17.045 --> 26:18.844
To get married.

26:20.607 --> 26:23.249
- Is that right?
- What you think about that?

26:25.651 --> 26:27.450
Nothin', I guess.

26:28.534 --> 26:31.927
So I guess you don't want me
to wait for you either.

26:32.056 --> 26:34.857
Look, Juanita,
I didn't say that.

26:34.979 --> 26:37.575
So then you're gonna marry me
when you get back?

26:40.304 --> 26:42.817
I mean, if you
ain't got somebody else.

26:44.866 --> 26:47.381
I don't want nobody else.

26:49.669 --> 26:52.505
Juanita, have you
ever thought maybe...

26:54.192 --> 26:57.791
maybe I might get hurt out there
and never come back?

26:57.877 --> 27:01.110
You know, I don't want
you waitin' for nothin'.

27:03.959 --> 27:05.952
You're not scared of losing me?

27:07.162 --> 27:10.362
I didn't say that either.

27:10.484 --> 27:12.284
I'm scared of losing you.

27:20.134 --> 27:24.927
So, do you think we could probably
do it one more time before I go?

27:25.055 --> 27:26.855
Uh-huh.

27:42.789 --> 27:44.381
Oh, no.

27:47.514 --> 27:49.869
- It's Ma!
- Shh! But it's just 6:30!

27:49.995 --> 27:53.546
- She just pulled up.
- Well, go stall her. And close my door!

27:53.636 --> 27:55.594
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Oh, man.

27:55.679 --> 27:58.355
I shouldn't have never messed around
with you in the first place.

27:58.481 --> 28:00.438
- Right. - You know Bertha
gonna kill us. - Wait a minute.

28:00.564 --> 28:02.476
- Uh-uh. Ain't gonna wait no minute.
Would you move? - Wait a minute!

28:04.805 --> 28:06.684
Come on. Let me help you
with them packages.

28:07.767 --> 28:09.566
- Delilah!
- I got it.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.966
Girl, you got my good groceries
all on the ground.

28:12.051 --> 28:15.012
Pick those up.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.892
Since I work, the least you girls
could do is keep this place clean.

28:29.264 --> 28:31.496
You know I'm gonna
wait for you, Anthony.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.312
Juanita, I gotta go.

29:00.445 --> 29:02.246
I gotta go, Juanita.

29:04.490 --> 29:08.201
- Nigger, get out of my yard!
- Fuck you!

29:12.016 --> 29:13.815
Shut up!

29:15.098 --> 29:16.929
What's your status? Over.

29:28.386 --> 29:30.744
Shit.

29:30.828 --> 29:33.630
Head for the rally point!
Get back to the rally point!

29:35.753 --> 29:37.747
Get the fuck outta here!

29:42.236 --> 29:44.835
Let's go! Pick it up!
Pick it up! Come on! Come on!

29:44.960 --> 29:48.158
Come on! Move!
Move! Let's go!

29:48.242 --> 29:50.882
Load 'em up! Load 'em up!

29:54.166 --> 29:57.001
Oh, fuck!
I'm out of ammo!

29:57.130 --> 29:59.724
- Devaughn! Cover me!
- Stay down!

30:01.211 --> 30:03.567
I got him! Hurry up!

30:05.774 --> 30:08.609
Don't check out on us, Martin. You're gonna
be all right. You're gonna be all right.

30:08.737 --> 30:11.536
- I got him!
- Cover fire!

30:12.900 --> 30:16.054
Goddam it! They got us pinned down!
We'll never make the rally point!

30:18.104 --> 30:20.381
Dugan!

30:20.467 --> 30:23.984
You think it's time we get these
fucking dinks off our asses? Huh?

30:24.108 --> 30:25.908
- Relax.
- Fuck you!

30:26.030 --> 30:29.229
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

30:29.352 --> 30:32.506
Radio, up!

30:32.594 --> 30:35.111
God don't like dinks.

30:35.198 --> 30:39.239
- How's he doin', Curtis?
- Thanks. Thanks for not leavin' me, man.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.438
- Where the fuck is that radio? Get that radio up here!
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:42.522 --> 30:45.084
Radio comin'! Radio comin'!

30:45.204 --> 30:48.405
Get that cover fire, Ferguson.
You wanna die, boy?

30:51.328 --> 30:53.447
Sir, sir! Lieutenant!
Arty freak!

30:55.011 --> 30:58.450
Hammerhead, Hammerhead. Recon Cobra.
Emergency fire mission. Over.

30:59.454 --> 31:01.686
Hold on, brother. Come on.
Come on, come on.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.770
You gonna make it, dude.
You only got a little longer.

31:03.899 --> 31:06.539
- You gonna make it.
- Grid five, seven, one-niner.

31:06.660 --> 31:10.178
- Tell my mama...
- No, no, I don't...

31:15.146 --> 31:17.789
Gooks in the bush.
Request firecracker salvo. Will adjust.

31:17.908 --> 31:19.707
How copy? Over.

31:19.830 --> 31:22.664
Roger. Solid copy.
Firecracker shot out.

31:22.792 --> 31:25.262
Incoming!

31:25.394 --> 31:28.228
Down! Down! Down!

31:28.316 --> 31:30.593
Curtis, get down!
Curtis, get down!

32:10.588 --> 32:13.264
Out-fucking-standing job.

32:13.389 --> 32:16.429
Saddle up. Let's get to the rally point,
take that whirlybird home.

32:16.513 --> 32:20.063
- We got some beer to drink.
- We goin' to the rally point now?

32:23.677 --> 32:26.796
The mission's been compromised.
We're goin' to site 37.

32:27.879 --> 32:29.759
It ain't compromised no more.

32:29.841 --> 32:32.757
They're dead.
Now this is Sneaky Pete.

32:32.846 --> 32:36.201
Reconnaissance.
Some of them dead gooks...

32:36.327 --> 32:39.207
they could have important
intelligence papers on their bodies.

32:42.772 --> 32:45.001
All right.

32:45.133 --> 32:47.330
- Move 'em out.
- Move out!

32:49.817 --> 32:52.935
Hammerhead, Hammerhead.
Cobra on site of your mission now.

32:53.019 --> 32:57.537
I count ten... say again, ten...
November-Victor-Alpha-Kilo-India-Alpha.

32:57.662 --> 33:02.057
- How copy? Over.
- I copy, one-zero. Good job.

33:02.145 --> 33:04.981
Hammerhead, Cobra. Solid copy.
Good job. Cobra out.

33:09.071 --> 33:12.669
Aw, shit, man! What you doin'?
He already dead.

33:23.281 --> 33:25.798
Motherfucker.

33:25.883 --> 33:27.954
Looks like we nailed us
an officer.

33:29.325 --> 33:34.323
You lucky bastard. You get back to C.P.,
you name your own price, sir.

33:34.451 --> 33:38.414
No way, D'Ambrosio.
I'm keepin' this one.

33:38.493 --> 33:40.883
Been lookin' for one of these
since Cleon and I got here in '66.

33:41.015 --> 33:43.655
Ain't that right, Cleon?

33:46.139 --> 33:47.971
I walked right by that guy.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.569
You gotta keep your eyes open.

34:01.549 --> 34:03.621
Oh, man, what the fuck?

34:24.246 --> 34:26.125
You hungry or somethin', Cleon?

34:27.928 --> 34:30.491
Just like you, sir.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.331
I'm collectin' me a souvenir.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.255
Saddle up. We're movin' out.

34:42.018 --> 34:45.775
That's all he's gonna say? You ain't got
nothin' to tell this fuckin' shit, man?

35:04.156 --> 35:07.355
- Man, that nigger Cleon crazy.
- Yeah.

35:07.479 --> 35:09.276
- Did you see that shit?
- I saw it.

35:09.401 --> 35:11.359
- Nigger, did you see that shit?
- Yes.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.838
I heard that nigger's supposed
to be a preacher's son and shit.

35:13.922 --> 35:16.724
He cuttin' off motherfucker's
heads for souvenirs and shit.

35:16.805 --> 35:19.686
Now, if you hadn't flunked out
of Hunter College, pimp daddy Skippy...

35:19.808 --> 35:21.845
you would've missed all this
good shit down in Vietnam.

35:21.929 --> 35:25.890
Kiss my ass, nigger. You the reason
why I'm at this motherfucker anyway.

35:25.973 --> 35:27.805
You didn't tell me 'bout
this recon shit.

35:27.895 --> 35:30.125
- That's 'cause you didn't ask me when you were writin' me.
- Nigger, I didn't have to.

35:30.255 --> 35:33.010
- Shit, I figured it was better than being a grunt.
- It is.

35:33.138 --> 35:36.132
Ant, motherfucker,
we out in the woods all day.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.492
Them motherfuckin' gooks jumpin' out
like Indians every five minutes.

35:38.581 --> 35:41.255
- Man, a nigger ain't made for this shit.
- You thought this was a skate.

35:41.382 --> 35:43.502
Nigger, ain't nothin'
wrong with no skate.

35:43.626 --> 35:46.142
You could just call me
a skatin' motherfucker.

35:46.266 --> 35:48.942
I skate my ass right out of here,
they give me a chance to.

35:50.952 --> 35:54.468
- Ain't no shitbirds on my squad.
- Man, what you jivin' about?

36:09.884 --> 36:12.082
Hey. Hey.

36:12.205 --> 36:15.837
Ant. To the Bronx.

36:15.969 --> 36:17.767
Yeah, uh...

36:17.891 --> 36:21.043
to the youngblood
who couldn't be with us today.

36:21.174 --> 36:24.009
- Lance Corporal Martin.
- To Lance Corporal Martin.

36:31.741 --> 36:35.292
- Yes.
- Yo, Ant, man.

36:35.425 --> 36:37.301
What they be puttin'
in your head out here, man?

36:37.385 --> 36:40.662
I mean, you done got into this shit
a little bit too deep, don't you think?

36:40.787 --> 36:44.180
You're in recon now, Skip.
You in deep too.

36:46.192 --> 36:48.149
Man, fuck this shit, man.

36:48.234 --> 36:50.351
- Oh, come on, man.
- Man, this ain't our war, man.

36:50.473 --> 36:53.549
Shit, our black ass should be
back in the Bronx where we belong.

36:53.678 --> 36:57.434
Joe-ass got lucky. They sent him
home, gettin' wounded and shit.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.082
Heard he wounded his hand
pretty bad, man.

37:00.202 --> 37:03.001
Shit, that's all right, though.
He got out of this shit.

37:03.125 --> 37:06.199
I rather be home with a fucked-up hand
up in some pussy than to be out here...

37:06.326 --> 37:08.207
healthier than
a motherfucker without it.

37:08.289 --> 37:11.248
- Shit.
- Same old Skip. Boy, you ain't changed.

37:11.369 --> 37:13.168
That's right.

37:13.293 --> 37:16.128
You heard from Juanita?

37:16.254 --> 37:18.292
She used to write me a lot
during my first tour.

37:18.415 --> 37:20.566
We got a package for ya!

37:20.697 --> 37:25.216
Turns out, man, before I left,
fucked around and got her pregnant.

37:27.142 --> 37:28.939
- Man, you bullshittin'.
- No, I ain't.

37:29.064 --> 37:32.056
- No shit?
- Dead serious, man. Got a little girl back at home.

37:32.145 --> 37:36.266
Oh, man, that's groovy, man. That's
groovy. I can dig it. That's cool.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.221
Hey, dig, man, I know
you got a picture, man.

37:38.351 --> 37:41.743
- Let me see her picture. Shit.
- Can't even look at her, man.

37:41.873 --> 37:43.865
Man, what the fuck
you mean, bro?

37:43.953 --> 37:46.027
That's your little girl, man.
That's your baby.

37:46.156 --> 37:48.511
You know how I survived
26 months in the bush?

37:48.596 --> 37:52.799
Because I don't think about the world,
Skip. That shit don't exist to me.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.039
I don't give a fuck about anything
or anyone in it...

37:55.162 --> 37:59.761
because the minute I do, I'm a dead man
out here, and you remember that shit.

37:59.886 --> 38:03.278
We'll talk about the world
when we get back.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.764
Yeah, whatever, man.

38:05.889 --> 38:07.928
I'm gonna go get high.

38:08.054 --> 38:11.603
I mean real high. And I'm gonna
get my dick sucked too.

38:18.061 --> 38:19.779
Big dick. Big.

38:19.903 --> 38:22.019
Very, very big.
Can you handle it?

38:25.386 --> 38:29.063
"Hey there, Kirby.
What's happenin' back in the world?

38:29.148 --> 38:31.105
If you hadn't heard,
doin' my second tour. "

38:32.671 --> 38:35.027
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

38:38.595 --> 38:40.746
"We spend most of our time
livin' in the bush.

38:43.198 --> 38:45.237
Kind of numb to
everything out here.

38:45.319 --> 38:47.631
Tryin' to keep
my head clear.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.842
Our lieutenant is this crazy
white boy named Dugan from Ohio.

38:55.806 --> 38:57.925
He's good at gettin' us
out of crazy situations.

39:01.492 --> 39:04.007
We got this one wild-ass
brother out here named Cleon. "

39:04.135 --> 39:06.046
Gook fuck.

39:06.135 --> 39:09.575
"His daddy's this big-time preacher, but
you'd never know from his crazy son. "

39:09.656 --> 39:14.259
Now you're good.
Now Jesus loves you.

39:14.381 --> 39:17.580
"He's from Mount Vernon.
Oh, yeah. You won't believe it...

39:17.663 --> 39:20.226
but Skip volunteered
for my unit.

39:20.347 --> 39:22.145
I don't think he's
cut out for recon.

39:22.266 --> 39:27.503
He's always gettin' high and shit,
tryin' to keep his mind off things.

39:27.631 --> 39:31.424
Me, I'm just tryin' to take it one day
at a time and do what's right...

39:32.875 --> 39:35.153
whatever that is.

39:35.237 --> 39:37.671
See you when I get
back to the Bronx.

39:37.798 --> 39:39.596
Anthony. "

40:49.491 --> 40:51.404
That fuckin' shit stinks.

40:53.335 --> 40:57.933
I don't wanna pull rank, Cleon, but if
you don't get rid of that fuckin' head...

40:58.018 --> 41:00.055
I don't hear nobody else
complainin' but you.

41:01.380 --> 41:03.738
Well, maybe you should
listen to your team.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.617
Medical advice, Cleon:
You dump that shit.

41:06.744 --> 41:09.660
Hey, Doc, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.

41:09.747 --> 41:13.264
Fuck you, man. It stinks like
a sack full of assholes.

41:13.390 --> 41:16.144
Ain't a one of us got as much
as a splinter in his finger...

41:16.271 --> 41:18.185
since I cut this head off.

41:18.314 --> 41:20.704
This head is our
good-luck charm.

41:22.036 --> 41:26.032
Nah, this here's
our good-luck charm.

41:26.160 --> 41:29.198
If you don't mind, Sergeant, I...
My vote is to get rid of it.

41:29.282 --> 41:31.843
Man, Cleon, you need to get the fuck on
with that bullshit, man.

41:31.963 --> 41:35.561
- That head smell like shit.
- Bottom line, Staff Sergeant.

41:37.607 --> 41:40.568
You either get rid of that fuckin' head
A.S.A. fuckin' P., or I'm gonna...

41:40.690 --> 41:44.764
have your ass court-martialed
when we get back to the rear.

41:44.892 --> 41:47.330
We clear?

41:57.943 --> 42:00.743
Cobra, Cobra, Delta six. Over.

42:00.864 --> 42:03.381
Delta six, Delta six, Cobra.
Copy. Over.

42:03.507 --> 42:05.544
Cobra, Delta six.
Execute Charlie, Michael...

42:05.627 --> 42:10.581
We're in a world of shit now.
I just buried our luck.

42:10.711 --> 42:14.309
Listen up. Change of mission.
A patrol from 25 has found...

42:14.395 --> 42:17.753
a shitload of weapons in a vill
about a klik and a half to our whisky.

42:17.878 --> 42:19.677
Platoon commander wants us
to interrogate on the spot.

42:19.799 --> 42:22.552
Betancourt, you're the closest one in
the area that speaks that gook shit.

42:22.681 --> 42:26.836
So that's where we're headin'.
All right, saddle up. We're movin' out.

42:26.924 --> 42:31.524
- So now where's D'Ambrosio?
- He went to go take a shit.

42:31.647 --> 42:34.243
- When?
- When Cleon was diggin' the hole.

42:34.370 --> 42:36.168
- Why the hell didn't you go with him?
- You know how he is.

42:36.291 --> 42:39.410
- He don't like nobody around when he's shittin'.
- Oh, man.

42:39.532 --> 42:41.730
Grab his shit.
Let's find him.

42:50.222 --> 42:52.019
Aww.

42:52.142 --> 42:54.898
Fuck! Doc.

42:55.025 --> 42:57.939
- 360!
- D'Ambrosio, what'd they do?

42:58.067 --> 43:01.948
You'll be all right.
Doc's gonna take care of you, okay?

43:09.475 --> 43:11.627
This morphine is all
I can do for him right now.

43:16.802 --> 43:19.874
Here, Doc. You can use mine
if that's not enough.

43:20.003 --> 43:22.918
Are you crazy? Another one of those
would kill him right now.

43:33.254 --> 43:35.688
What the fuck
you got there, Curtis?

43:35.775 --> 43:39.563
Somethin' about
"Black men, go home.

43:40.819 --> 43:42.574
This isn't your war. "

43:42.700 --> 43:45.934
You get rid of that cocksucking
commie bullshit right now.

43:49.305 --> 43:51.421
- Yeah. Right.
- Hey, Curtis.

43:51.545 --> 43:54.302
- Apply some pressure here.
- We gotta hump this man back to the rally point.

43:54.430 --> 43:56.227
Oh, shit.

43:59.193 --> 44:00.991
Save me, Curtis.

44:01.113 --> 44:03.107
Look, Adam, you don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

44:03.237 --> 44:05.307
We're a team,
okay, brother?

44:05.398 --> 44:08.196
- We gonna take care of you.
- Please.

44:08.279 --> 44:11.239
Yeah. It's not much longer.
We're almost there.

44:12.482 --> 44:14.281
Kill me.

44:16.565 --> 44:18.364
Kill me!

44:19.968 --> 44:22.360
I would do it
for you.

44:22.489 --> 44:24.687
I would do it
for you, Curtis.

44:24.772 --> 44:27.128
Buttermilk 17.
Cobra, over.

44:27.253 --> 44:31.808
Cobra, Cobra. Buttermilk 17. Inbound
your buzz. Contact on your visual.

44:31.936 --> 44:33.735
- Shh.
- Buttermilk 17. Cobra.

44:33.857 --> 44:35.976
Hey, you gonna be all right.

44:36.100 --> 44:39.299
The medevac will be here
in a minute.

44:39.422 --> 44:41.461
Do it.

44:45.388 --> 44:47.185
You think
I don't mean it?

44:49.231 --> 44:52.189
I can't go home like this.

44:52.271 --> 44:55.425
- Hey, what's he saying?
- He's delirious, man.

45:01.558 --> 45:03.436
- Please.
- Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk.

45:03.519 --> 45:07.232
- Hooking direct to your 12. Stand by.
- Cobra standing by. Over.

45:51.155 --> 45:53.876
Shh-shh-shh.

45:57.759 --> 46:01.313
Uh, Cobra, Buttermilk 17.
Roger your visual. Pop smoke. Over.

46:01.444 --> 46:03.673
Buttermilk 17, Cobra.
Smoke. Over.

46:03.804 --> 46:06.878
Pop the smoke.
Get that man ready for medevac!

46:17.935 --> 46:21.089
- When'd he go?
- A few minutes ago.

46:22.538 --> 46:25.499
It's better to check out
than go home all fucked up.

46:27.862 --> 46:29.661
No shit.

47:29.669 --> 47:32.344
Oh, shit!
Get down!

47:33.513 --> 47:36.073
Fuckin' assholes!

47:36.192 --> 47:39.266
- Stay down! Stay down!
- I'm gonna get these motherfuckers!

47:39.396 --> 47:42.628
Return fire! Fire!

47:42.759 --> 47:45.355
Get these motherfuckers!

47:48.722 --> 47:51.558
- Skip! Return some fire!
- Shoot them motherfuckers!

47:51.685 --> 47:56.044
Mission aborted! We get the fuck
out of Dodge, back to the rally point!

47:56.128 --> 47:59.248
Ferguson! Get some
fuckin' rounds goin'!

48:00.930 --> 48:03.605
Skip! Cover me!

48:03.733 --> 48:05.885
- Dugan!
- Dugan, wait!

48:07.737 --> 48:11.573
Dugan!
Dugan!

48:20.825 --> 48:24.869
Skip! Skip!
Snap out of that shit. Go!

48:24.951 --> 48:28.468
- Fuck this, man. Let's bug out, Cleon!
- Cobra, move the fuck out!

48:28.591 --> 48:30.662
- Get up! Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

48:30.792 --> 48:33.105
Move! Get up!
Get up! Come on!

48:43.321 --> 48:45.121
- What are you doin'?
- What is this, man?

48:45.243 --> 48:48.239
- Slow down, man.
- Fuckin' grunts!

48:48.326 --> 48:51.287
- Say, get a special shot for Skip. My man's
goin' home today. - Count of three: 1-2-3.

48:51.408 --> 48:53.684
All right. Good.
Now come on, now. Skip, come on, now.

48:53.769 --> 48:56.082
Let's see a dap, man.

49:02.498 --> 49:05.615
- All right!
- Get one like this. Get one like this.

49:05.739 --> 49:07.653
Come on, now.
Everybody, come on. Get closer.

49:07.783 --> 49:10.091
- Ah, man!
- This is Cobra, baby.

49:10.223 --> 49:14.662
- Recon Cobra!
- It's Cobra. Hey, hey!

49:14.744 --> 49:16.941
Team Cobra, ready?

49:34.319 --> 49:36.119
Come on

49:40.085 --> 49:43.078

Well, that's what I'm talkin' about,
them bad habits, honey.

54:12.566 --> 54:16.722

No bad habits, Ma.

57:14.782 --> 57:17.297

You know, "Hello, how you doin'?"
That would've been real nice...

59:42.970 --> 59:46.045

Don't you think I know that, Anthony?

01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:13.551
It's not important anyway. The important
thing is that you're here now.

01:02:13.683 --> 01:02:15.959
Shh. Come here.

01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:18.919

01:02:59.516 --> 01:03:02.316
Yeah. She's all played out.

01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:08.833
- Cutty, I wanted you to meet, um...
- Look here.

01:03:08.924 --> 01:03:11.315
- Got a little somethin' for Sarah.
- Smiling faces

01:03:11.445 --> 01:03:16.079
- Buy her something real nice.
- Smiling faces sometimes

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:18.810
Hey, Cutty, I told you
to stop spoilin' her like this.

01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:21.163
Smiling faces

01:03:21.251 --> 01:03:24.692
Smiling faces tell lies

01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:28.088
- Somebody's gotta do it.
- And I got proof

01:03:28.219 --> 01:03:32.135
- Beware
- Cutty, I want you to meet Anthony.

01:03:37.185 --> 01:03:39.860
Okay. All right.

01:03:39.986 --> 01:03:42.866
Let me just put her to bed. You come on
in and make yourself at home.

01:03:42.989 --> 01:03:44.787
Come on in.

01:04:08.126 --> 01:04:10.802
Okay. Can I get you something
to drink, or...

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:14.363
Look, Juanita.
Uh, I think I better go.

01:04:14.493 --> 01:04:16.564
But you just got here.

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:20.253
Who knows, you could be
expectin' company or something.

01:04:20.337 --> 01:04:22.569
Nobody's comin' here, Anthony.

01:04:22.698 --> 01:04:24.497
I think I still should go.

01:04:29.302 --> 01:04:31.614
Anthony.

01:04:31.705 --> 01:04:34.061
I used to see Cutty.
Is that what you wanna hear?

01:04:34.146 --> 01:04:36.822
Oh. Blood made that very clear to me.

01:04:36.949 --> 01:04:38.940
So then, what's the problem?

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:41.267
Problem?

01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:45.107
Why, man throwed two yards on your car.

01:04:45.194 --> 01:04:48.235
You askin' me what's the problem?
Shit. Obviously nothin'.

01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:50.235
Don't come up in here judgin' me.

01:04:50.357 --> 01:04:52.921
What the fuck, man?
You got a pimp around my daughter?

01:04:53.001 --> 01:04:54.719
Oh, he is not a pimp.

01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:56.959
And besides, if you cared anything
about havin' a daughter...

01:04:57.084 --> 01:04:59.554
you'd have wrote me back
after I sent you our picture.

01:04:59.685 --> 01:05:01.643
But don't jump on me
for havin' a life.

01:05:01.767 --> 01:05:03.964
You didn't want one with me.

01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:08.889
So now what?

01:05:09.012 --> 01:05:11.848
Are you gonna leave?

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:13.774
Some bullshit.

01:05:21.062 --> 01:05:23.020
Come here.

01:05:23.103 --> 01:05:25.665
Come on. Come here.

01:05:37.995 --> 01:05:39.825
Ooh, hey

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:43.879
Ya gotta, gotta payback
Payback

01:05:43.999 --> 01:05:46.116
- Damn!
- Revenge

01:05:51.605 --> 01:05:54.200
A man
The big payback

01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:56.204
Got to get back

01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:58.445
Cleanup time, Cowboy.

01:05:58.569 --> 01:06:01.880
See, man, why the fuck
you always gotta talk some shit?

01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:05.406
Payback
Right there

01:06:05.536 --> 01:06:08.529
- See, that's why I kicked his fuckin' ass when he was a little kid, man.
- Payback

01:06:08.617 --> 01:06:12.294
- Always gettin' smart and shit.
- A man

01:06:12.419 --> 01:06:14.810
Get down with my girlfriend

01:06:16.142 --> 01:06:18.737
That ain't right

01:06:18.863 --> 01:06:21.379
Now you gonna play this marine
war hero.

01:06:21.506 --> 01:06:23.577
Out of touch

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:25.706
You know what I think?

01:06:25.831 --> 01:06:28.424
- I think y'all was some goddam fools goin' over there...
- Gonna fight

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:31.022
fightin' that white man's war.

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:34.032
- That's right.
- Payback everything you got to see

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:37.192
- What you got when you get back here, huh?
- Yeah

01:06:37.278 --> 01:06:39.667
- Never do any damn thing
- Not a goddam thing.

01:06:42.402 --> 01:06:45.042
Course, you do got
that fine-ass Juanita.

01:06:45.124 --> 01:06:48.276
- Throw me out
- Now, what the fuck you lookin' at me like that for, man?

01:06:48.407 --> 01:06:49.887
I'm just complimentin' you
on your taste.

01:06:50.007 --> 01:06:54.366
Throw me away
You had all the rage

01:06:54.451 --> 01:06:57.445
- You had me down
- Course you know...

01:06:57.573 --> 01:06:59.567
- That's the facts
- Baddest motherfucker this side of Nicky Barnes...

01:06:59.694 --> 01:07:01.925
- Now, you punk
- My boss man Cutty...

01:07:02.056 --> 01:07:04.492
Gettin' ready for the big payback

01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:06.371
I thought that might ring a bell.

01:07:06.499 --> 01:07:08.652
The big payback
That's where I learned

01:07:08.782 --> 01:07:12.095
He used to tap that ass
while you was over in Nam.

01:07:12.183 --> 01:07:14.016
- The big payback
- Motherfucker!

01:07:14.106 --> 01:07:18.260
- Goddam!
- You do some fuckin' talkin', don't you, goddam it!

01:07:18.388 --> 01:07:20.108
Try this on, motherfucker.

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:22.706
- No, no, no. He needs his ass whipped.
- What you mean "no"?

01:07:24.393 --> 01:07:27.627
Get the fuck outta here!
Talk shit now, huh, motherfucker?

01:07:27.717 --> 01:07:30.708
- Shut the fuck up. Come on. Come on. Motherfucker. Now what?
- I'm ready to be respected

01:07:30.837 --> 01:07:33.195
You wanna fuck with me or what?
I'm gonna fuckin' kill your ass!

01:07:33.319 --> 01:07:35.835
- Say somethin' now, motherfucker.
- That's enough, youngblood.

01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:40.041
- Pull out your goddam knife!
- No! That's enough. Come on!

01:07:40.164 --> 01:07:41.917
- I gonna kill this motherfucker!
- That's enough!

01:07:42.006 --> 01:07:43.805
That mother! I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker!

01:07:43.887 --> 01:07:46.357
- Let me go, Kirby! Let me go!
- No. He's already beat up. Come on now.

01:07:46.449 --> 01:07:51.049
- Oh, shit.
- Come on. Let's go get some air.

01:07:51.173 --> 01:07:53.450
Don't need no fuckin' air!
Let me go!

01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:55.730
- Let me hit him, hit him, hit him
- That's game.

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.224
Shit.

01:08:19.313 --> 01:08:21.749
Gonna have the aeroplane corn bread.

01:08:21.836 --> 01:08:24.192
Here we go.
Ooh!

01:08:24.277 --> 01:08:26.746
- You gonna spoil that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:26.879 --> 01:08:29.519
Gonna spoil that one in your belly too.

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:32.442
I don't need no spoiled kids.

01:08:32.523 --> 01:08:34.435
Hey, why not?

01:08:34.564 --> 01:08:36.283
Not enough black babies are spoiled.

01:08:36.366 --> 01:08:38.723
Ain't that right, Sarah, hmm?

01:08:38.846 --> 01:08:40.600
You got a point there.

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.687
Come on. Sit on down.

01:08:45.774 --> 01:08:48.607
Big girl. Come here.

01:08:50.296 --> 01:08:52.095
Come here.

01:08:53.459 --> 01:08:56.020
Look at you.

01:08:56.102 --> 01:08:58.219
Fat girl.

01:08:58.303 --> 01:09:00.772
See what we got ourselves here.

01:09:00.863 --> 01:09:03.825
Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna
have ourselves a little boy.

01:09:05.828 --> 01:09:08.343
Yeah, come on, man.
You got to be a boy.

01:09:08.469 --> 01:09:11.225
Boy, boy, boy. Mm.

01:09:11.352 --> 01:09:15.792
Ant Junior.
See, it's the power of the mind.

01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:18.305
We will ourselves a little boy.

01:09:20.196 --> 01:09:22.429
Then can you will yourself
a better job?

01:09:25.921 --> 01:09:28.392
Can you will yourself to stop
drinkin' so much?

01:09:28.524 --> 01:09:31.279
Come on, honey.
Don't even start that shit, all right?

01:09:31.406 --> 01:09:34.481
I thought we supposed to be havin'
a nice time here.

01:09:40.535 --> 01:09:42.252
Look, Juanita.

01:09:43.335 --> 01:09:46.296
I- I'm gonna get myself
a... a good job.

01:09:46.377 --> 01:09:50.134
You know how long you been singin'
that same old song now, Anthony?

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.861
I mean, in case you haven't noticed,
this here's the real world.

01:09:52.982 --> 01:09:55.259
Ain't no free meals here
like in the marines.

01:09:58.026 --> 01:10:01.499
Say, let me tell you somethin'.
Wasn't nothin' free in the marines.

01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:04.310
I earned every meal
and every fuckin' dollar, all right?

01:10:08.794 --> 01:10:10.627
Look, everything's gonna be cool.

01:10:13.998 --> 01:10:16.434
You know I'll be
five months next week.

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.679
You're five months pregnant,
you can't be no nurse's aide.

01:10:19.801 --> 01:10:21.600
I said we'll be all right.

01:11:01.314 --> 01:11:05.310
Hey, um... Anybody want some speed?

01:11:05.437 --> 01:11:08.033
Get the fuck outta here
with that shit.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.434
Say, why don't you
cut the bullshit, Joe?

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.361
Can't you clear your mind
for one sec, man?

01:11:13.444 --> 01:11:15.514
Now, you sure that they
pick up cash money?

01:11:15.644 --> 01:11:17.476
Hey, cash money, bro.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.916
Like clockwork, once a month.
Then they stop by the post office...

01:11:20.007 --> 01:11:23.160
before they make their final run
to Washington, man.

01:11:23.249 --> 01:11:26.084
All the way to Washington, D.C.,
where they burn the money.

01:11:26.211 --> 01:11:28.282
Can you believe that shit?

01:11:28.373 --> 01:11:30.843
Old bills, man.
Sometimes a couple million.

01:11:30.936 --> 01:11:33.896
- How many guards?
- Four.

01:11:33.977 --> 01:11:36.493
Two in the front
and one in the back carry revolvers.

01:11:36.619 --> 01:11:41.094
The other one, 12-gauge shotgun, man.

01:11:41.183 --> 01:11:42.903
You think we can take 'em?

01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:48.580
I can't say, man.
I mean...

01:11:48.667 --> 01:11:51.664
four guards, and all of 'em
packin'?

01:11:51.752 --> 01:11:55.463
I put up the guns. I get the money
together to get the plans goin'.

01:11:55.594 --> 01:11:57.472
But you got to be the master planner.

01:11:57.556 --> 01:12:00.025
You got medals for blowin'
motherfuckers up out there.

01:12:00.157 --> 01:12:04.234
- Man, I heard you were like John Wayne.
- Well, then that's the deal.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.432
Yeah, all that money.

01:12:06.561 --> 01:12:08.361
Ah, man.

01:12:10.482 --> 01:12:13.285
Anthony. You down?

01:12:16.367 --> 01:12:18.167
- Ahh.
- The look

01:12:19.492 --> 01:12:22.290
- Of love
- Let's drink on it anyway.

01:12:22.373 --> 01:12:26.688
- Is in your eyes
- Mmm.

01:12:28.257 --> 01:12:30.172
- Ahh.
- A look

01:12:30.299 --> 01:12:32.211
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Your heart

01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:36.303
- Say, man. Shhh. -
Can't disguise - Hmm?

01:12:36.424 --> 01:12:39.976
Put the goddam thing away.
Get your little pyromaniac ass...

01:12:40.067 --> 01:12:42.743
- You gonna be walkin' in a minute.
- Aw, cool out, Kirby, man.

01:12:42.868 --> 01:12:45.465
I'm not gonna burn your car.
Not yet, at least.

01:12:53.315 --> 01:12:56.356
Don't go

01:12:56.478 --> 01:12:58.755
Forget it, Juanita.

01:12:58.839 --> 01:13:00.672
Come on. Watch out there.

01:13:04.324 --> 01:13:06.443
The look of love

01:13:09.368 --> 01:13:11.803
What's the problem, Anthony?

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:15.482
What is it? I mean,
is it because I'm pregnant?

01:13:15.613 --> 01:13:17.286
Shh. Come on.
Now, don't be silly.

01:13:17.374 --> 01:13:19.207
So, then what's the problem?

01:13:23.257 --> 01:13:25.058
Come on. Talk to me.
What is it?

01:13:30.024 --> 01:13:32.665
I told you. You need to
leave that alcohol alone.

01:13:56.564 --> 01:13:59.239
- No! No!
- Anthony! Anthony, baby!

01:13:59.324 --> 01:14:01.362
It's me.
It's me. It's all right.

01:14:01.447 --> 01:14:03.279
It's all right.
Come here.

01:14:03.367 --> 01:14:07.844
Shh. Shh. Shh.
It's just another dream.

01:14:07.971 --> 01:14:09.771
It's just another dream.

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:19.370
This is my best cut,
Mrs Stein. Enjoy.

01:14:19.502 --> 01:14:21.935
Thank you very much, Saul.

01:14:22.062 --> 01:14:25.614
- He's such a nice man.
- What did he give you?

01:14:25.744 --> 01:14:27.702
- We need to talk.
- Oh.

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:34.469
- So what's happenin'?
- You're a good man.

01:14:34.551 --> 01:14:38.262
Aw, come on, Saul. I ain't got time to kibitz
with ya. I got a whole lot of meat to cut.

01:14:40.397 --> 01:14:42.228
I'm closing down the shop.

01:14:44.278 --> 01:14:46.839
Should've told you sooner,
but I thought maybe...

01:14:46.919 --> 01:14:49.392
business, you know,
pick up a little.

01:14:51.044 --> 01:14:52.637
Sorry.

01:14:54.325 --> 01:14:57.605
- Here.
- Oh, no, look, Saul... No. I can't.

01:14:57.729 --> 01:15:00.565
What am I gonna do with it?
I have to get rid of it.

01:15:00.651 --> 01:15:02.290
Come on.

01:15:09.779 --> 01:15:11.610
Now I know

01:15:11.698 --> 01:15:15.330
We have great respect

01:15:15.461 --> 01:15:18.218
For the sister and mother

01:15:18.344 --> 01:15:20.143
It's even better yet

01:15:22.507 --> 01:15:24.977
But there's the joker in the street

01:15:25.108 --> 01:15:28.946
Here you go, brother.
Don't let the bullshit get to you.

01:15:29.029 --> 01:15:30.865
I'm tryin', man. I'm tryin'.

01:15:30.955 --> 01:15:33.070
You wanna get the man's foot
off your neck?

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:35.910
Come check us out.

01:15:36.038 --> 01:15:38.757
Take care of yourself, brother.
Live righteous.

01:15:38.879 --> 01:15:41.155
Here you go, brother.
Here you go.

01:15:41.282 --> 01:15:44.194
Take care of yourself, brother.
Come see us now.

01:15:44.323 --> 01:15:46.394
Don't let us hang around this town

01:15:46.485 --> 01:15:50.606
- Here you go, sister.
- And let what others say come true

01:15:50.728 --> 01:15:52.242
Brothers and sisters, here you go.

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:09.604
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.
Hey, youngblood.

01:16:12.934 --> 01:16:14.652
Bringin' in the groceries, huh?

01:16:16.135 --> 01:16:18.524
Lord, have mercy.

01:16:18.656 --> 01:16:21.219
Man, I remember
when I was married.

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:24.379
I used to love
to bring home the groceries.

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:26.853
Made me feel real good.

01:16:26.984 --> 01:16:30.866
Like a man. Know what I mean?

01:16:32.147 --> 01:16:33.867
Hey, listen, youngblood. Uh...

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:35.867
I just dropped by
to see Juanita and Sarah.

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:38.871
- You know, lay a little somethin' on 'em.
- Stopped by to see my baby?

01:16:38.992 --> 01:16:40.585
Is that right?

01:16:40.714 --> 01:16:42.512
You know, youngblood...

01:16:42.635 --> 01:16:45.515
I took care of your woman and your baby
when you were in the war.

01:16:45.596 --> 01:16:48.909
Now, a man oughta get a little respect
for somethin' like that.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.673
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you.

01:16:50.762 --> 01:16:54.041
I care about Juanita.
I care about her a whole lot.

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:58.006
But you back now, and I'm gone.

01:16:58.088 --> 01:17:01.604
So from this point on, you should
consider me like a friend of the family.

01:17:01.729 --> 01:17:03.801
Find yourself in a jam and shit,
need a little cash...

01:17:03.932 --> 01:17:06.653
you come see me,
I'll front you.

01:17:06.732 --> 01:17:09.089
- Keep your shit.
- Listen, brother.

01:17:09.175 --> 01:17:11.327
I know about pride.

01:17:11.457 --> 01:17:13.413
But you got mouths to feed.

01:17:13.537 --> 01:17:15.370
Now, I laid a little cash
on Juanita.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:18.220
Say, man, stay the fuck
away from my family.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:19.861
What did you say?

01:17:19.983 --> 01:17:22.339
You heard me, goddam it.

01:17:22.425 --> 01:17:24.383
I said, "Stay the fuck away
from my family. "

01:17:26.507 --> 01:17:28.181
See, I ain't the enemy, youngblood.

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:32.949
I don't want no trouble.

01:17:39.837 --> 01:17:41.750
Shit.

01:17:47.082 --> 01:17:50.441
See, I tried to be a friend,
motherfucker.

01:17:57.812 --> 01:17:59.644
Surprise, nigger.

01:18:02.014 --> 01:18:04.813
Big bad marines.

01:18:04.896 --> 01:18:06.726
Look at you now.

01:18:07.858 --> 01:18:10.294
Does she suck you?

01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:11.901
Fuck you?

01:18:12.982 --> 01:18:15.544
Make you feel like a man?

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.456
Make you feel real good?

01:18:19.387 --> 01:18:22.107
Huh, boy?

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:24.984
Now, she wasn't doin' it like that
before you went to the war, now was she?

01:18:29.514 --> 01:18:31.632
Now you gettin'
all that good lovin'...

01:18:33.038 --> 01:18:35.598
and you can't even put food
on your fuckin' table.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:40.793
Come on, Santa Claus.
Open your mouth and suck this.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.399
Come on. I got a present for you.
Suck it!

01:18:43.525 --> 01:18:46.917
- Suck it, nigger!
- Kill me, motherfucker.

01:18:47.005 --> 01:18:48.886
Shoot me right now.

01:18:49.007 --> 01:18:50.762
What you gonna do, shoot me?

01:18:57.134 --> 01:18:59.936
You lucky this is personal, nigger.

01:19:00.058 --> 01:19:02.129
I ain't gonna kill you
over no woman.

01:19:03.299 --> 01:19:05.213
Don't you ever...

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:07.253
in your fuckin' life...

01:19:08.382 --> 01:19:10.854
bite the hand
that feeds you, nigger.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.866
See ya, Santa Claus.

01:19:26.037 --> 01:19:28.314
- Hold still now.
- I'm all right.

01:19:28.439 --> 01:19:30.714
- Hold still.
- No, I'm all right. Damn!

01:19:46.851 --> 01:19:49.685
You givin' him that money back.

01:19:49.773 --> 01:19:52.131
He won't take it back.

01:19:52.257 --> 01:19:56.251
What the fuck you talkin'...
You better get his shit back to him!

01:19:56.379 --> 01:20:00.214
Even if I wanted to give it back to him,
Anthony, he wouldn't take it back.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:04.139
W- W-W-Wait. What the fuck you talkin'
about, "if you wanted to give it back"?

01:20:05.346 --> 01:20:06.939
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that shit.

01:20:07.027 --> 01:20:10.466
Have you forgotten you just lost your
damn job? We need that fuckin' money.

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:13.189
- We don't need his money.
- Yeah, well, Anthony, I'll tell you what.

01:20:13.272 --> 01:20:17.506
You start bringin' some real money in here, like a real
man, and then I'll think about givin' it back to him.

01:20:17.594 --> 01:20:20.987
Until then, I don't wanna hear shit.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:25.717
You need to get your tight ass together, that's what you
need to do, and stop feelin' sorry for your damn self.

01:20:25.841 --> 01:20:29.552
Sometimes it's like you ain't even
the same man I knew before the war.

01:20:29.683 --> 01:20:32.597
That's who I was in love with. That's who
I thought showed the fuck back up here.

01:20:32.725 --> 01:20:35.482
I don't know who the fuck you are.

01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:38.289
So, what? You just, uh,
suck his dick so good...

01:20:38.410 --> 01:20:41.369
he just start
throwin' money at you, right?

01:20:41.451 --> 01:20:43.046
What is with you?

01:20:43.173 --> 01:20:46.087
Why you so damn paranoid?
I ain't fuckin' him.

01:20:46.215 --> 01:20:48.173
Not at this moment, you ain't. No.

01:20:48.298 --> 01:20:49.936
But the motherfucker
ain't sniffin' around here...

01:20:50.058 --> 01:20:52.734
tossin' money in your
motherfuckin' face for nothin'!

01:20:52.821 --> 01:20:55.816
Yeah, well, I sleep with you
every night, don't I?

01:20:55.943 --> 01:20:59.142
You know, Juanita,
that's a damn good question.

01:21:00.787 --> 01:21:03.585
Come on. Go ahead.

01:21:03.708 --> 01:21:06.304
Admit this shit, man. Be honest.
You fuckin' him, right?

01:21:06.431 --> 01:21:08.821
- Is that what you wanna hear, Anthony? That's
what you wanna hear? - Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:08.952 --> 01:21:11.548
Fine. I'm fuckin' him.

01:21:14.956 --> 01:21:17.713
So, uh, whose baby is that?

01:21:20.682 --> 01:21:22.991
D- Don't even answer that shit.

01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:25.119
No, you right. I ain't gonna answer it.
I mean, shit. You Anthony.

01:21:25.204 --> 01:21:28.518
You the big marine man with no damn job.
You know every fuckin' thing.

01:21:28.647 --> 01:21:34.408
Answer this for me: If you think I'm jivin' you
so much, Anthony, why the hell you with me? Huh?

01:21:34.492 --> 01:21:38.283
Why the fuck you with me? What, you think
I need you? Do you think I need this shit?

01:21:38.416 --> 01:21:40.691
Fuck. You can't get a decent job,
you won't fuck me.

01:21:40.816 --> 01:21:43.492
The only time I get to hold you is when you're
havin' one of them silly-ass nightmares...

01:21:43.578 --> 01:21:45.456
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.974
You don't know, girl.
You really don't know.

01:21:50.945 --> 01:21:53.539
- Don't you fuckin' walk away from...
- You better get the fuck off of me!

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:56.465
- Don't walk away from me, Anthony.
- Let me go.

01:21:56.547 --> 01:21:58.780
- Don't you... What about Sarah?
- I'll fuckin' kill you, girl!

01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:02.268
Don't you ever run up on me! Ever!
Ever run up on me again!

01:22:02.392 --> 01:22:05.944
I'll fuckin' kill you, Juanita!
Get the fuck off me!

01:22:06.035 --> 01:22:07.866
Bunch of shit!

01:22:25.849 --> 01:22:28.239
- Yeah!
- That's right. You can't trust them!

01:22:31.774 --> 01:22:35.486
- Now, they send our men off to Vietnam...
- That's what they do.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:38.895
to fight for this
so-called democracy.

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:41.337
- That's right. Preach, sister.
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:43.374
But when they get back down
to the South Bronx...

01:22:43.461 --> 01:22:46.502
and to Bed-Stuy and Harlem
and Watts, etc., etc...

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:49.220
shit is worse than ever.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:56.301
- There is something very sick about that.
- He's a devil.

01:22:56.432 --> 01:22:58.185
That's right,
he's the devil.

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:02.347
That's right!

01:23:04.838 --> 01:23:08.151
Go, sister! Go on!

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.796
- Power to the people!
- Power to the people!

01:23:12.765 --> 01:23:15.839
- In 'n' out.
- Never, never gonna give you up

01:23:15.966 --> 01:23:18.483
I'm never, ever gonna stop

01:23:18.569 --> 01:23:20.877
Not the way
I feel about you

01:23:21.008 --> 01:23:24.006
- Girl, I just can't live without you
- There you go.

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:26.363
- I'm never, ever gonna quit
- What can I get you, baby?

01:23:26.494 --> 01:23:28.770
Anyway, so like I was sayin',
I ran into this brother...

01:23:28.897 --> 01:23:30.774
and he, uh, gave me
this flyer.

01:23:30.858 --> 01:23:33.010
So I figured I'd go over
and check it out.

01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:38.096
And there you were, up there
talkin' that ol' righteous shit.

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:42.217
I'm just a college student tryin' to do
her part to rally the people together.

01:23:42.344 --> 01:23:46.502
But, dig, we need more
than talk. It's... It's time to do.

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:49.059
- Do what?
- Revolution.

01:23:49.152 --> 01:23:52.111
Oh, wait a minute. See.
Y'all a little outta my league now.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:54.266
Is that what you're gonna say
when the revolution comes?

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:57.230
W- When it's time
to pick up a gun?

01:23:57.317 --> 01:23:59.148
What you know
about weapons?

01:24:01.039 --> 01:24:03.030
I'm qualified
to handle a. 45...

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.202
an M-16 rifle,
a. 38-calibre pistol...

01:24:06.323 --> 01:24:08.282
and a Russian AK-47.

01:24:08.365 --> 01:24:11.485
An AK-47?

01:24:15.411 --> 01:24:17.323
Why don't you join us?

01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:20.127
A lot of brothers
from the war have.

01:24:20.254 --> 01:24:23.215
Baby, I got enough
heavy shit to deal with.

01:24:30.582 --> 01:24:32.575
- I got you, brother.
- Relax.

01:24:35.345 --> 01:24:37.576
You're so uptight.

01:24:37.707 --> 01:24:40.702
Damn, I got to make
some fuckin' bread.

01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:43.629
I'm through
with your sister, but...

01:24:43.711 --> 01:24:47.185
I still got to take care
of my baby girl, Sarah.

01:24:47.314 --> 01:24:50.149
Shit, and the one
that's on the way.

01:24:50.277 --> 01:24:52.668
Damn!

01:24:52.798 --> 01:24:56.954
Look, anyway, uh, I got
this plan to make some money.

01:24:57.083 --> 01:24:59.517
I want you to keep
this shit to yourself.

01:25:01.726 --> 01:25:04.718
At 6:15 a. m., the truck
pulls outta the post office...

01:25:04.846 --> 01:25:07.966
at 149th and Grand Concourse.

01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:11.169
Now, it makes one stop
before it goes to D. C...

01:25:11.252 --> 01:25:15.247
which is a mail drop-off
at First Federal Loan and Savings...

01:25:15.374 --> 01:25:18.212
which is on Noble Street
and West.

01:25:18.297 --> 01:25:20.130
Now, Kirby...

01:25:20.218 --> 01:25:22.131
you're gonna position yourself
in a getaway car...

01:25:22.259 --> 01:25:25.460
at the end of the corner,
where you can see everything.

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:29.619
Jose. Me and you gonna
position ourselves behind the bank...

01:25:29.706 --> 01:25:34.179
underneath the left
and the right side of the loadin' dock.

01:25:34.309 --> 01:25:38.305
Delilah, you're gonna position
yourself inside the Dumpster...

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:41.391
which is located directly across
from the loadin' dock.

01:25:44.277 --> 01:25:46.792
Now, Skippy, I want you
to position yourself...

01:25:46.918 --> 01:25:49.993
approximately ten feet
from the alleyway.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.432
There, you post
a lookout.

01:25:53.524 --> 01:25:55.355
We all know what to do
at the point of attack...

01:25:55.443 --> 01:25:58.200
because we've gone
over that shit enough.

01:25:58.326 --> 01:26:02.801
If anybody gets caught, you shut
the fuck up, and we'll keep your money.

01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:05.366
Shh! Fuck that shit, man.

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:07.848
I'm telling you right now,
if I get caught...

01:26:09.935 --> 01:26:12.451
- I'm shooting my fuckin' way out.
- Nigger, put that shit down.

01:26:12.576 --> 01:26:15.298
I think we need another man
on the street with Skip.

01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:17.172
Someone to cover
the other side.

01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:20.097
- I agree.
- Oh, man! Hell, no!

01:26:20.224 --> 01:26:22.136
We don't need no 'nother man.
Shit, I can see.

01:26:22.225 --> 01:26:25.504
- Besides, we got too many motherfuckers anyway.
- Fuck that shit, Kirby, man.

01:26:25.587 --> 01:26:28.547
Everybody trusts
everybody here, right?

01:26:31.832 --> 01:26:33.870
I can get somebody
from our organization.

01:26:33.993 --> 01:26:37.955
Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't want none
of them revolutionary niggers involved.

01:26:38.037 --> 01:26:40.392
You can cut your eye at me
all you want to.

01:26:40.517 --> 01:26:42.637
I ain't too keen on havin'
that broad up in here neither.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:46.072
Well, you the one talkin' about we need
another man. Make up your goddam mind.

01:26:46.203 --> 01:26:48.922
You have somebody in mind,
Anthony?

01:26:49.044 --> 01:26:52.563
We might as well put a motherfuckin' ad
in the paper. Then we gonna get everybody.

01:26:52.686 --> 01:26:55.362
Shit, ain't gonna be
no money left for a nigger.

01:26:59.092 --> 01:27:02.883
Oh, yes! Y'all didn't know
your reverend was a gamblin' man?

01:27:03.016 --> 01:27:06.977
A sinnin' man?

01:27:07.058 --> 01:27:09.777
I was a man who maimed!

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.620
I was a man who killed!

01:27:15.744 --> 01:27:20.060
We all know it was done
in the name of the wicked one.

01:27:20.147 --> 01:27:23.938
The one that was
cast down from heaven.

01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:27.382
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

01:27:27.512 --> 01:27:31.793
I said y'all know
who I'm talkin' about!

01:27:31.917 --> 01:27:34.478
Can I get a "hallelujah"
in this house of God?

01:27:34.558 --> 01:27:36.630
Hallelujah!

01:27:36.761 --> 01:27:38.275
Hallelujah!

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.714
Well, look here, man.
Skip is in. Period. All right?

01:27:41.805 --> 01:27:45.401
I stand a lot to lose
if this thing blows up in my face.

01:27:45.527 --> 01:27:48.441
The last time I saw him, he was
shooting poison in his veins.

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:51.442
Yeah, I know. Well, you know,
he's tryin' to shake that shit, man.

01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:55.287
- He's still on drugs.
- And I still trust him with my life, Cleon.

01:27:56.976 --> 01:28:00.332
Remember that last battle?

01:28:00.456 --> 01:28:02.289
He froze up.

01:28:02.419 --> 01:28:05.856
For a minute.
Then h-he broke out of it.

01:28:05.941 --> 01:28:10.382
And when he "broke out of it,"
Dugan was dead.

01:28:10.464 --> 01:28:12.616
Come on, Cleon. You know that
could've happened to any of us.

01:28:12.706 --> 01:28:16.306
Now either you in
or you out. Which one?

01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:18.866
How much money did you say
was in that truck?

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:37.850
We still got
about 15 minutes.

01:30:37.934 --> 01:30:40.242
I tell ya, I could've
used another cup of coffee.

01:30:40.374 --> 01:30:42.175
Let's make this quick.

01:30:49.102 --> 01:30:50.899
Bank security.

01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:58.500
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:00.423
- Mornin'.
- Good mornin'.

01:31:35.096 --> 01:31:37.214
Oh, f...

01:31:50.909 --> 01:31:53.581
You waitin' on
the number 11 bus?

01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:55.542
Yes.

01:31:55.671 --> 01:31:58.552
I don't think
she runs this early.

01:31:58.674 --> 01:32:03.034
I caught it the other morning,
uh, at this same time.

01:32:03.156 --> 01:32:04.477
You sure about that?

01:32:05.799 --> 01:32:07.631
Uh-huh.

01:32:07.722 --> 01:32:10.873
- Let me check for you.
- No need to go to any trouble, Officer.

01:32:11.003 --> 01:32:12.802
No, no, no.
No trouble at all, brother.

01:32:15.726 --> 01:32:18.195
I see by that patch
on your jacket you were in recon.

01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:22.270
I was a 5th marine. Always willin'
to help out a fellow leatherneck.

01:32:27.436 --> 01:32:29.269
Brown on patrol.
Brown on patrol.

01:32:29.358 --> 01:32:32.670
Requesting off-hour route check
on number 11.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.230
Dispatch to Brown.
Hold for schedule.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.154
That's a copy.

01:32:37.242 --> 01:32:39.361
Do somethin', Cleon.

01:33:13.670 --> 01:33:16.551
- Ambush! Ambush!
- Drop it, motherfucker!

01:33:50.616 --> 01:33:53.088
What the hell?

01:33:55.341 --> 01:33:57.061
Shit!

01:34:28.525 --> 01:34:31.485
Joe! Come on. Let's move.

01:34:41.294 --> 01:34:43.892
Oh, goddam it!

01:35:23.006 --> 01:35:25.727
Fuck! Shit!

01:35:31.931 --> 01:35:34.449
Oh, shit!

01:35:35.895 --> 01:35:37.933
Anthony!

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:13.355
- Did you see that shit, man?
- Hey, what the fuck wrong with you?

01:36:13.483 --> 01:36:15.759
- See the way the fuckin' doors blew off, man?
- No, motherfucker!

01:36:15.844 --> 01:36:18.121
Motherfuckin' Joe, you blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

01:36:18.207 --> 01:36:20.644
- It blew up like that, man!
- That's how you fucked your hand up last time!

01:36:20.768 --> 01:36:23.159
You... And the money... You fucked up.
I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass!

01:36:23.291 --> 01:36:25.682
Grab what you can, motherfucker,
before the whole thing burns!

01:36:25.773 --> 01:36:27.764
Hey, Anthony and Delilah
gotta see this shit, man.

01:36:27.894 --> 01:36:30.012
I'm gonna go get 'em!
Hey, Anthony!

01:36:31.817 --> 01:36:35.369
You gotta see the shit I did, man.
I blew that shit up, man!

01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:38.813
You gotta see it, man!
You gotta see the shit I did!

01:36:40.984 --> 01:36:43.453
Let's get outta here.
Put the gun down. Put the gun down.

01:36:43.585 --> 01:36:45.418
Come on, Delilah.
Let's get up. Up. Let's go.

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:50.229
Come on, bro.

01:36:50.352 --> 01:36:53.151
We gotta go, man.

01:36:53.272 --> 01:36:56.267
I can't...
I can't leave her.

01:36:56.354 --> 01:36:59.156
You ain't gotta
leave her, bro...

01:36:59.237 --> 01:37:01.627
'cause she's already gone.

01:37:05.681 --> 01:37:07.161
Get up here!
Go on!

01:38:04.206 --> 01:38:07.005
Unit 1004, do you copy?

01:38:07.088 --> 01:38:09.205
Please respond.

01:38:09.329 --> 01:38:13.119
Do you require assistance?
Do you copy?

01:38:13.212 --> 01:38:15.446
Any available units
in the vicinity of Noble Street.

01:38:15.575 --> 01:38:17.806
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three. Repeat.

01:38:17.935 --> 01:38:19.893
Two-eleven in progress.
Code three.

01:38:47.998 --> 01:38:50.752
God's not gonna
forgive me for this one.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:54.874
I'll tell you what, Reverend. With this kind
of money, you can buy your way into heaven.

01:38:56.565 --> 01:38:59.205
That's where you're wrong, brother.

01:38:59.286 --> 01:39:03.725
We done bought our way into hell.

01:39:03.809 --> 01:39:07.725
The plain fact is that I promised
the Lord I would never sin like this.

01:39:10.294 --> 01:39:13.529
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure
I even want any of this dirty money.

01:39:14.977 --> 01:39:17.448
Well, I'll tell you what,
Reverend.

01:39:17.539 --> 01:39:19.373
We'll find somethin'
to do with your share.

01:39:19.463 --> 01:39:23.173
- Amen to that shit.
- No. No, no, no, no.

01:39:23.304 --> 01:39:25.866
- I'll take the money.
- You lyin' sack o' shit.

01:39:27.947 --> 01:39:30.987
I'm sure the Lord will find
another way for me to do my penance.

01:39:32.751 --> 01:39:34.982
Just tell me
one thing, Cleon.

01:39:35.112 --> 01:39:37.344
Why the fuck
you didn't grab the cop?

01:39:37.434 --> 01:39:40.590
You killed him.
A young brother.

01:39:40.717 --> 01:39:43.916
If you wouldn't have froze up like a bitch, maybe
I wouldn't have had to do that shit, now wouldn't I?

01:39:43.999 --> 01:39:46.069
Would y'all
shut the fuck up?

01:39:47.522 --> 01:39:50.675
Man, Delilah. Shit.

01:39:50.804 --> 01:39:53.843
Man, radio said they got
Joe's stupid ass.

01:39:53.967 --> 01:39:57.518
Fucked it up.
The whole plan was fucked up.

01:40:00.212 --> 01:40:03.124
We ain't do shit right
out there, man. Shit.

01:40:05.897 --> 01:40:09.813
Y'all make sure that Jose's share
goes to Marisol and his kids.

01:40:09.899 --> 01:40:11.855
- Walk on by
- Done.

01:40:17.944 --> 01:40:20.939
Your junkie ass really
messed up out there.

01:40:21.068 --> 01:40:22.659
Don't blame me
for your fuck-ups.

01:40:22.749 --> 01:40:27.985
I told Anthony I didn't want nothin' to
do with a crazy, devil-filled junkie!

01:40:28.110 --> 01:40:30.753
- What?
- You listenin' to me? Look at him.

01:40:32.074 --> 01:40:34.955
- Oh, shit!
- Now say some more shit!

01:40:35.037 --> 01:40:36.869
I'll knock your ass
right back down.

01:40:36.958 --> 01:40:39.598
Fake-ass wanna-be preacher,
no-members-havin' motherfucker!

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:43.518
Why don't y'all stop actin'
like some fuckin' clowns?

01:40:43.644 --> 01:40:46.479
You know, you niggers
sure is silly.

01:40:46.567 --> 01:40:50.084
Now, you're standin' here fightin',
and we got over $300,000...

01:40:50.207 --> 01:40:53.362
of cold, hard, unmarked U.S. cash
to split up five ways.

01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:56.763
Let me tell ya somethin'. You make me lose
count again, I'm gonna shoot me a motherfucker...

01:40:56.893 --> 01:40:58.851
and then we gonna be splittin'
this thing up four ways, hear?

01:41:02.017 --> 01:41:05.979
Man, I can't believe this.
They was gonna burn all this shit.

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:08.935
All this shit, and a nigger
can't even find a job.

01:41:10.462 --> 01:41:14.255
Well, that's Uncle Sam
for you, baby.

01:41:14.385 --> 01:41:16.185
Money to burn.

01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:21.589
Police have issued an all-points
bulletin for the remaining...

01:41:21.672 --> 01:41:23.504
...Reserve Bank
on Noble Street.

01:41:23.592 --> 01:41:25.028
Faces painted skeleton white.

01:41:25.154 --> 01:41:27.795
Cobra, request your status.
Over.

01:41:27.876 --> 01:41:29.675
- Five federal security guards...
- Anthony!

01:41:29.797 --> 01:41:32.439
- She's already gone.
- Do it. Kill me.

01:41:32.521 --> 01:41:34.112
The bloody shootout erupted...
an armoured truck... explosives...

01:41:34.242 --> 01:41:37.792
No, motherfuckin' Joe. You blew the whole
motherfuckin' truck up, motherfucker!

01:41:37.924 --> 01:41:39.198
...the deaths of nine people.

01:41:39.285 --> 01:41:42.722
The heroin ain't never
did nothin' to me.

01:41:42.808 --> 01:41:45.085
...just moments away from the scene
of the crime... Robbery turned bloody...

01:41:45.168 --> 01:41:48.528
- Had some shit got into me over there, man.
- Crushed to death by...

01:41:48.650 --> 01:41:51.612
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

01:41:51.734 --> 01:41:54.728
Had a very shiny nose

01:41:54.857 --> 01:41:56.734
- And if you ever saw it
- What you slowin' down for?

01:41:56.857 --> 01:41:58.007
- Be cool. Be cool.
- What you doin'?

01:41:58.138 --> 01:42:01.532
- Come on. Come on.
- What the fuck, man? Aw, shit!

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:05.213
- All of the other reindeer
- What the fuck we doin' over here?

01:42:05.344 --> 01:42:07.813
- Say, man, check out all these kids.
- Man!

01:42:07.906 --> 01:42:09.705
Hey, let's go to the liquor store
and go to the club.

01:42:09.826 --> 01:42:12.468
Look, man, I'm gonna take care of you.
We're gonna go down to the club.

01:42:12.549 --> 01:42:14.542
- We don't know them motherfuckers!
- That's the whole point, baby.

01:42:14.631 --> 01:42:16.910
Come on. Get in the spirit.
Hey, y'all come on over here!

01:42:17.033 --> 01:42:20.027
- Nigger, we gonna get robbed.
- Hey, be cool, nigger. Y'all come on over here.

01:42:20.115 --> 01:42:24.796
- Be cool, man. Damn.
- Rudolph, with your nose so bright

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:26.916
All of y'all gonna get some.
All right. All right.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.834
- Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
- What, motherfu...

01:42:28.922 --> 01:42:30.992
Yeah, man. Merry Christmas,
motherfucker. Go on. Leave me alone.

01:42:31.123 --> 01:42:34.754
Say, say, Skippy. Hey, man, why don't you
bring your ass over here and quit that jivin'.

01:42:34.884 --> 01:42:37.721
Come on. Yeah, yeah. Y'all take
all the toys. All right. Get one.

01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:40.317
- See what I'm sayin'? I ain't kiddin'. We givin' it away.
- All right. All right. Yeah.

01:42:40.410 --> 01:42:43.245
That's why Santa Claus don't wanna come 'round here
'cause he's scared he's gonna get shot or robbed.

01:42:43.372 --> 01:42:48.131
All right. Just one. Hey, hey, hey. Give
me this, man. Get a... Get a... Get a toy.

01:42:48.255 --> 01:42:50.213
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Why you stealin'? You ain't gotta steal.

01:42:50.339 --> 01:42:52.534
- All right, all right, all right.
- Funky little brothers. I talked to him.

01:42:52.618 --> 01:42:55.259
He says he ain't never gonna come down
here unless he's got police protection.

01:42:55.341 --> 01:42:58.016
Last year, one of y'all niggers
stole one of his reindeer.

01:43:05.228 --> 01:43:09.190
No, no. I say let's just go up there
and kill that motherfucker.

01:43:10.873 --> 01:43:14.231
Man, me and Anthony gave out
a couple of things, but that was it.

01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:18.146
You gave toys and turkeys to people.
Then you got the hell outta Dodge.

01:43:18.279 --> 01:43:22.480
Man. Y'all sayin' my man is
goin' around handin' out $100 bills...

01:43:22.562 --> 01:43:24.872
and sayin' that
God Almighty gave it to him?

01:43:24.961 --> 01:43:28.561
My cousin lives up there in Mount Vernon. He
says that Cleon's up there actin' a goddam fool.

01:43:28.647 --> 01:43:30.717
That ol' high-profile ass
nigger.

01:43:30.848 --> 01:43:32.646
Bought a brand-new Caddy.

01:43:32.769 --> 01:43:34.408
Folk know he can't afford it.

01:43:34.530 --> 01:43:38.002
- Look, man, I'm gonna go over there and talk to him.
- No, no, no. Fuck the talk!

01:43:38.094 --> 01:43:40.892
I'm drivin' up there, and I'm gonna
take him out before he rats us out.

01:43:40.975 --> 01:43:43.775
Look, Kirby.
I'm gonna handle everything, all right?

01:43:43.897 --> 01:43:47.447
- I'm gonna straighten this shit out.
- All right.

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.972
But if you don't take care of this,
Anthony, I promise you, I will.

01:43:51.064 --> 01:43:53.181
I told you we didn't
need another man.

01:43:53.265 --> 01:43:56.064
That's y'all's motherfuckin'
punk-ass friend!

01:43:56.146 --> 01:43:59.458
People runnin' from their worries

01:43:59.589 --> 01:44:01.786
While the judge and his juries

01:44:03.192 --> 01:44:06.550
They take the law
that's part of the flaw

01:44:06.675 --> 01:44:10.511
No. Oh, shit, Cleon!

01:44:10.597 --> 01:44:12.590
Love, fallin', fussin' and a-cussin'

01:44:12.679 --> 01:44:14.194
Damn!

01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:17.517
The feelin' now is killin'

01:44:19.005 --> 01:44:21.234
For peace no one is willin'

01:44:22.566 --> 01:44:24.557
Kinda make you get that feelin'

01:44:27.088 --> 01:44:28.922
Everybody's startin'

01:44:30.451 --> 01:44:32.683
Use the pill and the dope

01:44:34.575 --> 01:44:36.645
Educated fools

01:44:37.937 --> 01:44:40.213
From uneducated schools

01:44:44.023 --> 01:44:47.699
Right now we'd like to bring on a young man
who believes in doing things his own way.

01:44:47.824 --> 01:44:50.977
And based on the way he kinda get next to
all of the folks who've seen him work...

01:44:51.067 --> 01:44:52.581
his way has gotta be
pretty hip.

01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:56.425
So let's lay some noise
on the mighty Al Green.

01:45:03.396 --> 01:45:05.195
Apartment 13!

01:45:06.318 --> 01:45:08.311
I'm so tired of bein' alone

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.716
I'm so tied up on my own

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:13.080
Won't you help me, girl

01:45:13.163 --> 01:45:17.444
Just as soon as you can

01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:24.848
Don't move, mister!

01:45:24.973 --> 01:45:28.364
I been wantin' to get
next to you, baby

01:45:28.494 --> 01:45:30.326
You see, sometime
I fold my arms, I say

01:45:30.456 --> 01:45:33.815
- Ooo-ooo
- Mmm-hmm-mmm

01:45:33.939 --> 01:45:36.328
Whoa-oh-oh

01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:38.929
Oh, baby, hey

01:45:40.382 --> 01:45:44.015
Needing you has proven to be

01:45:44.106 --> 01:45:47.498
To be my greatest dream
Yeah

01:45:47.588 --> 01:45:50.901
- I'm so tired of being alone
- Oh, tired, baby

01:45:53.112 --> 01:45:55.345
- Here's the rest of the fifties.
- Put it in there.

01:45:57.595 --> 01:46:01.274
You know, I still feel fucked-up
about this whole situation.

01:46:01.357 --> 01:46:05.319
Look, feelin' fucked-up don't help a goddam
thing and it ain't gonna bring nobody back.

01:46:05.441 --> 01:46:08.961
- Shit!
- So, just worry about yourself. We just gotta get outta here.

01:46:09.044 --> 01:46:13.245
- Come on.
- Say, man, you got everything?

01:46:13.368 --> 01:46:15.244
Yeah, grab that bag.

01:46:17.451 --> 01:46:19.807
This is a bitch.

01:46:19.933 --> 01:46:23.164
This is it, man.
This is it.

01:46:23.295 --> 01:46:25.173
All we got to do, boy,
is make it to Mexico.

01:46:25.296 --> 01:46:27.732
We'll be fine.
We'll get us a villa, see?

01:46:27.859 --> 01:46:30.420
And then, and buy a boat
and sail all around the gulf.

01:46:30.501 --> 01:46:33.381
Everything will be fine.
We just gotta get the fuck outta here.

01:46:33.503 --> 01:46:35.653
Yeah, maybe I can send
for Sarah once we get down there.

01:46:35.784 --> 01:46:38.619
Well, anything's possible.
Come on.

01:46:38.747 --> 01:46:41.138
Wait a minute.
Run, Anthony! Hyah!

01:46:41.229 --> 01:46:44.540
Y'all get back!
Get away right there! Get off me!

01:46:46.152 --> 01:46:48.509
Shit!

01:46:48.594 --> 01:46:52.066
- You pity fool, you pity fool
- Fuck!

01:46:52.155 --> 01:46:54.991
You better have some sympathy

01:46:55.119 --> 01:46:59.832
Yeah
'Cause there's educated people

01:46:59.963 --> 01:47:03.514
Runnin' the lives of our society

01:47:05.445 --> 01:47:07.006
Makin' up the rules

01:47:08.721 --> 01:47:12.602
Mr Curtis, you have been
lawfully tried in this court...

01:47:12.684 --> 01:47:14.917
and found guilty on all charges.

01:47:15.006 --> 01:47:18.638
Do you have anything to say on your own
behalf before I pronounce sentence?

01:47:18.769 --> 01:47:20.363
Uh...

01:47:20.452 --> 01:47:23.410
no, ain't nothin' I say
gonna get me out of this.

01:47:24.894 --> 01:47:28.251
But things were gettin' bad
for me, and...

01:47:28.376 --> 01:47:30.846
I had to do what I had to do
to s... to survive.

01:47:34.019 --> 01:47:35.931
Maybe it was wrong, but I...

01:47:36.063 --> 01:47:38.623
I certainly didn't mean
for anybody to be hurt.

01:47:38.703 --> 01:47:41.140
Uh, Your Honour,
please consider before sentencing...

01:47:41.265 --> 01:47:44.100
that my client served his country proud
in the Marine Corps.

01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:46.460
As a matter of fact, he was
a member of an elite unit...

01:47:46.549 --> 01:47:48.541
a sergeant,
decorated with many medals.

01:47:48.631 --> 01:47:52.593
In fact, one of those medals
was the, uh, Silver Star, for valour.

01:47:52.674 --> 01:47:55.314
I realize that my client had
a difficult time adjusting when he...

01:47:55.396 --> 01:47:58.072
Excuse me, Counsel.
I, too, was a marine...

01:47:58.157 --> 01:48:01.791
and I served my country proudly
in World War Il, a real war, I may add.

01:48:01.921 --> 01:48:03.719
- Yes, Your Honor...
- I'm not finished yet, please.

01:48:03.842 --> 01:48:07.077
I received the Purple Heart
at Guadalcanal.

01:48:07.205 --> 01:48:09.595
Now, this young man has obviously
forgotten some very...

01:48:09.687 --> 01:48:13.808
fundamental things like decency
and dedication and honor...

01:48:13.930 --> 01:48:15.569
everything the corps taught us.

01:48:15.691 --> 01:48:18.159
He is a disgrace to everyone
that has ever put on that uniform...

01:48:18.293 --> 01:48:23.371
and I will not permit you or him to use
the Vietnam War as a cop-out here.

01:48:25.059 --> 01:48:28.212
Anthony Curtis, for your
participation in this crime...

01:48:28.341 --> 01:48:31.858
a crime that took the lives of several
innocent people, I do hereby...

01:48:31.945 --> 01:48:35.062
sentence you to the custody of the
Attorney General of the United States...

01:48:35.145 --> 01:48:37.501
for a period of 15 years to life.

01:48:37.626 --> 01:48:40.189
Oh, my God.

01:48:40.269 --> 01:48:44.186
These proceedings are concluded.
This court is adjourned.

01:48:44.274 --> 01:48:47.472
"Life"? What the fuck
he mean "life"?

01:48:47.556 --> 01:48:49.944
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

01:48:50.035 --> 01:48:53.191
What the fuck he talkin' about, "life"?
Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:55.151
- Hey!
- Oh, Anthony!

01:48:55.281 --> 01:48:57.318
After all the shit I did
for this motherfuckin' country?

01:48:57.403 --> 01:48:59.155
You, remove the prisoner
from the court!

01:48:59.244 --> 01:49:02.202
- You hear me? - Fuck you! Fuck
you! - Restrain the prisoner!

01:49:02.325 --> 01:49:05.525
Get him outta here! Let the record
show... Let the record show...

01:49:05.647 --> 01:49:07.446
that a chair was thrown
at the judge.

01:49:14.094 --> 01:49:15.893
Whoa, whoa

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:26.177
If you see me
walkin' down the street

01:49:26.304 --> 01:49:29.058
And I start to cry

01:49:29.145 --> 01:49:31.536
Each time we meet

01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:36.908
Then walk on by

01:49:40.433 --> 01:49:43.268
Walk on by

01:49:45.437 --> 01:49:47.749
Make believe

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:51.358
That you don't see the tears

01:49:52.602 --> 01:49:55.277
You just let me grieve
in private

01:49:55.364 --> 01:49:58.518
'Cause each time I see you

01:49:58.608 --> 01:50:03.206
I just can't help myself
I think about how tight we used to be

01:50:03.331 --> 01:50:07.485
I break down and cry

01:50:07.574 --> 01:50:09.531
Oh, baby

01:50:09.616 --> 01:50:12.210
Walk on by

01:50:21.544 --> 01:50:24.505
Hmm-mmm-mmm

01:50:30.191 --> 01:50:34.584
I just can't get over
losing you

01:50:34.712 --> 01:50:38.188
So if I seem

01:50:38.278 --> 01:50:40.792
Broken in two

01:50:43.201 --> 01:50:46.752
Please walk on by

01:50:48.244 --> 01:50:50.759
Walk on by

01:50:53.087 --> 01:50:55.524
Foolish pride

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:58.804
Is all that I have left

01:50:58.932 --> 01:51:01.765
So let me hide

01:51:01.853 --> 01:51:06.328
The tears and the sadness
you gave me

01:51:06.457 --> 01:51:08.255
You put the hurt on me

01:51:08.378 --> 01:51:10.177
You socked it to me, mama

01:51:10.301 --> 01:51:14.979
When you said goodbye

01:51:16.505 --> 01:51:19.818
So, please, walk on by

01:51:21.710 --> 01:51:24.987
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

01:51:27.634 --> 01:51:29.465
So do me a favour

01:51:29.594 --> 01:51:32.954
And walk on by

01:51:34.638 --> 01:51:36.471
So I'm beggin' you to

01:51:36.559 --> 01:51:39.075
Walk on by

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.834
Oh, yeah

01:51:40.964 --> 01:51:43.762
And make believe you never see
the tears I cry

01:51:45.687 --> 01:51:47.644
So I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin' you

01:51:47.766 --> 01:51:49.963
To walk on by

01:51:52.451 --> 01:51:55.605
Make believe you never see
the tears I cry

01:51:58.456 --> 01:52:00.254
Oh

01:52:00.377 --> 01:52:02.609
There's no dust in my eye

01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:04.652
Oh, no

01:52:06.461 --> 01:52:08.260
Smoke ain't makin' me cry

01:52:08.384 --> 01:52:10.945
No, no, no

01:52:11.065 --> 01:52:13.980
It's the hurt
you put on me, yeah

01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:18.630
I don't want you
to see this man cry

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:25.265
Where is the love

01:52:25.395 --> 01:52:34.959
Where is the love

01:52:35.083 --> 01:52:37.235
Where is the love

01:52:37.365 --> 01:52:39.596
Ooh, yeah, yeah

01:52:39.726 --> 01:52:42.481
Where is the love

01:52:42.567 --> 01:52:45.085
You said you'd give to me

01:52:45.210 --> 01:52:47.601
Soon as you were free

01:52:47.693 --> 01:52:51.812
Will it ever be

01:52:51.934 --> 01:52:56.730
Where is the love

01:52:58.381 --> 01:53:02.978
You told me that you
didn't love him

01:53:03.063 --> 01:53:07.776
And you were gonna say goodbye

01:53:07.907 --> 01:53:12.745
But if you really
didn't mean it

01:53:12.831 --> 01:53:18.352
Why did you have to lie

01:53:18.434 --> 01:53:21.235
Where is the love

01:53:21.317 --> 01:53:23.958
You said was mine
all mine

01:53:24.078 --> 01:53:26.515
Till the end of time

01:53:26.601 --> 01:53:30.482
Was it just a lie

01:53:30.564 --> 01:53:35.164
Where is the love

01:53:37.011 --> 01:53:41.721
If you had had a sudden
change of heart

01:53:41.812 --> 01:53:46.571
I wish that you
would tell me so

01:53:46.696 --> 01:53:51.374
Don't leave me hangin'
on these promises

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:57.055
You've gotta let me know

01:53:58.305 --> 01:54:04.310
