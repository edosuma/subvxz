WEBVTT

00:12.360 --> 00:14.080
The plumbing needed fixing.

00:14.680 --> 00:17.600
There was money set aside
in the budget to fix it,

00:17.680 --> 00:20.000
but instead,
I plowed that money into materials

00:20.080 --> 00:22.640
for our upcoming musical project,
<i>West Side Story</i> .

00:23.120 --> 00:25.240
Due to start rehearsals today,

00:25.320 --> 00:28.200
which incidentally,
could be a game changer.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.720
Could lead to wide-scale prison reform…

00:30.800 --> 00:32.800
-…thanks to one idea I had.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.080
But I digress.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.600
-The plumbing broke. So far, so what?

00:39.160 --> 00:41.400
So far, 300 women haven't showered,

00:41.480 --> 00:43.880
cleaned their teeth
or flushed the toilet for 48 hours.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.280
The stench is unbelievable.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.360
They can, however,

00:47.440 --> 00:50.680
thumb through their personalized,
hand-bound parchment songbook,

00:50.760 --> 00:52.240
so every cloud…

00:53.400 --> 00:56.720
This is what my detractors would call
"a perfect storm."

00:56.800 --> 00:59.040
I think your detractors would call this
a public health emergency

00:59.120 --> 01:01.000
due to gross mismanagement
of prison funds, but…

01:01.080 --> 01:04.280
-Yeah, well you say "potahto."
-No one says "potahto."

01:05.800 --> 01:08.200
Oh, my God, you can almost taste it.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.840
-Don't even… I know, this is so COVID-19.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.960
Have you seen this lot?

01:23.520 --> 01:26.160
Look, you wouldn't think
we were just outside Billericay.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.080
You had the mujahideen over there?

01:28.640 --> 01:30.960
I mean,
you don't want this footage getting out.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.640
I don't know how any of them
have got an appetite, anyway.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.200
Because we don't all go home
and eat posh gay food, that's why.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.760
I'm not gay, boo. I'm just from Essex.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.040
The porridge has been made with milk!

01:40.120 --> 01:42.520
It's usually made with water,
but it's been made with milk!

01:42.600 --> 01:44.840
Jean's found the silver lining
in the water shortage.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.080
Mmm! Oh, that's delicious!

01:48.600 --> 01:50.560
Mmm, if it didn't smell so much
of shit in here,

01:50.640 --> 01:52.800
this would be
one of my top three brekkies.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.320
That's a low bar.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.200
Ah, this might be Tubby bye-byes for me.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.000
Most def time for Tubby bye-byes.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.400
-Delivery for Laura Willis.
-Yeah.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.039
500 bottles of hand sanitizer,
300 gallons of water,

02:14.120 --> 02:15.520
and one portable toilet.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.920
-Who's that for?
-Me.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.320
You've got your own toilet?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.920
I am the governor of this prison, Dean.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.440
-Can I use it?
-No.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.800
-But I'm your number two.
-It's not for number twos.

02:24.880 --> 02:25.880
-Why not?
-Why would it be?

02:25.960 --> 02:28.120
So, just to clarify,
this toilet, not for number twos?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.800
-I'm afraid not.
-Got it.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.160
Um, it's not-- It's not that much, is it?

02:32.240 --> 02:35.800
No, that's before VAT and delivery.
It's that much.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.720
Good.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.800
Yikesaroo, chica.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.480
But if you turn the electricity off
in the prison one day a week,

02:42.560 --> 02:44.040
-you may claw some of that back.
-Mmm.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.120
Just a thought.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.560
She's probably considering that.
Try not to breathe inside!

02:48.640 --> 02:50.240
Fuck you very much!

02:55.840 --> 02:59.840
Three days in and nothing could've
prepared me for this.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.560
I don't like causing trouble.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.240
Fat Pat is lovely
and has made me feel very welcome,

03:06.320 --> 03:09.760
but she's not adhering to the
"no passing of solids in the basin" rule.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.360
All right, Ange.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.720
All right, Fat Pat.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.920
Pass us the bog roll, Ange.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.960
I've requested a cell move.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.600
I've got a new business!

03:32.680 --> 03:34.240
What's your new business?

03:34.320 --> 03:35.480
Selling yo-yos.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.080
How's business?

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
Up and down.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.560
Very good. That's very good.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.400
They all play this game
called "I've Got a New Business."

03:44.480 --> 03:46.880
-It goes like this: I say…
-I've got a new business.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
-Then you say…
-What's your new business?

03:49.040 --> 03:50.720
Then I say what my new business is.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.320
I'm making plates for Greek weddings.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.720
-Then you say, "How's business?"
-<i>"How's business?"</i>

03:54.800 --> 03:58.720
Then I tell you how my new business
is going using a shit pun.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.280
I'm smashing it.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.360
-Hey!

04:02.440 --> 04:03.880
Pathetic.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.480
I'm a baker!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.200
Do you mean, "I've got a new business"?

04:09.280 --> 04:10.960
Yes, that's what I mean, isn't it?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.680
Put that one, too, over there.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.320
Let's move that new inmate, Paula.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.800
-Angela?
-Angela, is it?

04:18.880 --> 04:21.360
-Yes, let's move her to a new cell.
-Is she not happy with the view?

04:21.440 --> 04:23.680
No, Dean. She's not happy
with the way the system has failed her.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.519
She clearly doesn't belong here,
nor does she have the tools to survive.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.560
Plus, Fat Pat keeps shitting in the sink,

04:28.640 --> 04:30.560
so I think we can
cut the woman some slack.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.360
This is not something I can say in here
very often, but that woman is innocent.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.440
-Who, me?
-No, not you.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.760
-I am though, miss.
-No, you're not.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
-Am though.
-No, you're not.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.400
-I'm innocent, miss. Am!
-No, you're not.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.800
-No, you're not.
-I'm innocent, miss.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.520
You're never getting out.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.000
Ms. Cheryl Fergison,

04:54.080 --> 04:57.880
esteemed soap star turned director
for musicals in women's prisons,

04:57.960 --> 04:59.760
is in the building!

05:02.320 --> 05:05.520
I wasn't on the rota,
but I swapped shifts so I could greet her.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.840
She'll appreciate a friendly face.

05:07.920 --> 05:08.920
This face.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.720
Here she is, repeat <i>EastEnder</i> offender…

05:14.120 --> 05:15.760
I thought that was a good one.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.600
Oh, my God,
I had prepared for it to smell in here,

05:17.680 --> 05:20.280
but I didn't think it would be this bad.
It's like an open sewer.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.120
Apologies for that. The water is off,
but I can't detect anything

05:23.200 --> 05:25.880
other than the heady scent
of Lady Trott's talent.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.840
I'm regretting this already. Who's he?

05:27.920 --> 05:29.760
I'm not here
because I love prison theater.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.400
I'm not here to help out
or because I like Cheryl.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.440
I'm here because I'm a gun for hire,

05:34.520 --> 05:36.400
and this pays better than theater
right now.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.400
-I'll get that!

05:38.480 --> 05:41.360
-I'll get that. I'll get that.
-Have you got anything in your pockets?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.200
Oh, sorry. Yeah, my keys.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.440
-I got it! I got it!

05:46.160 --> 05:48.400
See that? I got it.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.000
What are you like, eh?

05:50.080 --> 05:53.760
Walking straight through, bold as brass,
no care for coin or keys.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.840
-Who are you?
-You!

05:55.920 --> 05:57.560
I knew you'd be trouble.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.320
I'm only joking.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.960
-No, I will not be in your musical.
-I am not going to last long in here.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.480
It's really worthwhile, Martin.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.680
I've done this before
and I can tell you, it feels good.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.200
These women get no excitement.
That's why we're here.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.000
That was amazing!

06:47.560 --> 06:49.640
That was just like being a kid again.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.280
We used to do so much fun stuff
when I was little.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.920
I mean, loads of it.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.440
Like-- Like jumping off things,

06:56.520 --> 06:58.040
and throwing things

06:58.120 --> 06:59.640
and stealing things.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.280
That was the most fun part.

07:01.360 --> 07:04.000
And that's the thing
that made my mammy the most proud.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.400
-I love you, Mammy!
-The guards are coming!

07:06.480 --> 07:10.120
-Whoa.
-Oh, for goodness' sake, Doug, every time!

07:10.200 --> 07:11.800
Be careful what you're doing there.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.200
That is human waste
you have nearly slopped all over me.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.600
And thank you for being so near to it.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.240
-What is this all about?

07:21.320 --> 07:23.320
I don't know.
Could it be the ice cream van?

07:23.400 --> 07:26.880
Don't be ridiculous.
It usually signals some sort of emergency.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.000
But in case you're right,
I'll have raspberry ripple, one scoop.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.240
Two scoops!

07:38.360 --> 07:40.000
I'm sure it's nothing, folks,

07:40.080 --> 07:42.200
but we are going to a holding area
for safety.

07:42.280 --> 07:43.280
For safety?

07:43.360 --> 07:46.880
It's fine, it's fine, but this inmate
needs to be somewhere secure.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.920
-What inmate?
-This inmate.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.480
That's Cheryl. We've met. Not an inmate.

07:51.560 --> 07:55.520
Sorry, Cheryl. The alarm's going off,
so I couldn't see you properly.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.200
Pop yourself in there. I don't think this
is going to take very long.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.560
Has someone been shivved?

08:02.640 --> 08:03.920
Eight shows a week in the West End,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.320
but all you've got to watch out for
is the price of the Häagen-Dazs.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.200
Whereas here, not only am I being
slowly poisoned by the smell of caca,

08:10.280 --> 08:13.600
at any given moment, I could be jumped
by Myra Hindley singing Bernstein.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.080
You're not in any danger.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.800
That's easy for you to say, Cheryl.
Look at you.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.400
They're not going to mess with you.
Whereas me, I'm low-hanging fruit.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.080
Why don't you get your keyboard out?
It might distract you.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.000
Do I look like someone
who could be easily distracted?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.080
Classic tune!

08:37.159 --> 08:40.799
Written by The Troggs in 1967,
I do believe.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.320
I don't know and I don't care.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.280
This is the 1994 Wet Wet Wet version,
and I should know. I was there.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.640
-<i>Code Blue, Gal. Code Blue.</i>

08:55.720 --> 08:57.560
That's the all-clear, folks.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.600
-What a shame, eh?
-Yeah, gutted.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.200
I thought it was really good.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.200
Do you know what this is?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.920
Another Health and Safety violation?
The theft of government property?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.760
-The misuse of communal supplies?
-Shall I tell you?

09:10.840 --> 09:11.840
-Sure.
-Progress.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.920
-Is it?
-100%.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
How so?

09:14.080 --> 09:17.080
This was no passive act.
Think what it required.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.760
Imagination, planning,
commitment, execution,

09:20.840 --> 09:23.080
the building blocks of rehabilitation.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.760
I feel a TED talk coming.

09:24.840 --> 09:29.200
This was an invaluable experience
and my gift to them.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.640
-Fat Pat broke her arm.
-It will heal.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.080
These women
are taking back their narrative.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.000
Willis! You ginger twat.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.200
-Do you know what that is?
-Hurtful?

09:38.280 --> 09:39.960
-The sound of freedom.
-My mistake.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.160
-It's a great day, Dean.
-You gaping old arsehole!

09:43.240 --> 09:45.160
-What was that one?
-More progress.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.720
-Come on. Single file, boos.

09:51.520 --> 09:55.240
Yeah, this is what happens
when you do an impromptu slip-and-slide.

09:55.320 --> 09:58.240
All the Pats, you know who you are.
They've all got nicknames.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.920
It started out
'cause there was a load of Pats.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.440
So you've got Fat Pat, Black Pat,
White Pat, Pat Pat. She's the OG.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.680
Then it spiraled from there, didn't it?

10:07.760 --> 10:09.840
I mean, I don't know,
what do they call you, Hair Net?

10:09.920 --> 10:11.920
Here we go, Jill the Canary.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.440
No Nugget Sue.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.800
It's all happening, innit?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.480
-Thick As Shit Jean.
-Night.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.640
All right, love.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.640
Who we got here?
Oh, yes, Step Ladder Lynne.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.800
-No, it's Long Mary.
-Oh, my mistake, boo.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.840
Yeah, I mean, I don't know
how they get away with it, really.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.120
But it's say what you see in here.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.280
Mad Barnett, Ginger Ale, Moo Moo,
I don't know.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.480
Lone Ranger.
There you go. Look, Angry Spice.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.800
Oh, yeah, have a look at this one.
Gormless Madge.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.320
We had that. Oh, here we go.
Chinese Su, without the E.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.760
Cathy With The Hat. No Hat Cathy.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.080
I mean, two and a half years,
she answered to Wallop Tits,

10:46.160 --> 10:48.080
then she got all hashtag MeToo.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.920
Oh, and coming up the rear,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.440
-Blind Sally.
-I'm not blind.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.360
No, well, you're going the wrong way, boo.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.920
I mean, you can't make that up, can you?
You all right, love?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.240
That's it. Good girl.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.640
There we go. Yeah. Mind the microphone.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.880
By law, inmates with disabilities are
not required to disclose their conditions.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.280
And Sally decided
that was the way forward.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.320
<i>She's partially sighted</i>
<i>in one or both eyes.</i>

11:13.400 --> 11:15.120
-<i>Part blind.</i>
-Oh!

11:15.200 --> 11:16.920
-<i>Semi-blind.</i>
-Whoa!

11:17.000 --> 11:18.880
-<i>Blind-ish.</i>
-Whoa!

11:18.960 --> 11:21.480
When she arrived,
I explained there was a lot I could do

11:21.560 --> 11:24.880
to adapt her environment,
to make her time in here easier.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.800
For example, ramps,

11:27.880 --> 11:29.120
handrails,

11:29.200 --> 11:32.680
those little rubber things that go round
sharp edges, like you do for toddlers.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.680
A guide dog.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.840
You're not getting me a guide dog.
Then they'll all know.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.520
They call you Blind Sally,
so I do think that horse has bolted.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.160
Where? I'm scared of horses.

11:40.240 --> 11:44.480
It's all right. It's gone now.
Just-- Just-- Just help me to help you.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.360
I know how it works in here.
I can't let these women know my weakness.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.040
That you're scared of horses?

11:49.120 --> 11:50.720
I appreciate the offer,

11:50.800 --> 11:53.320
but the best thing you can do
to make my time in here easier

11:53.400 --> 11:56.560
is treat me like everyone else
and don't draw attention to anything I do.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.280
-Got it?
-Understood.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.680
-Would you like--
-No!

12:08.880 --> 12:10.360
That's the stationery cupboard.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.560
-Ow! Fuck!

12:15.640 --> 12:17.400
Dear God.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.160
Can we go outside? Can't breathe in here.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.040
You should have thought of that before you
slid down the hallway on your belly, boo.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.600
I still haven't had a go.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.400
Mmm, hashtag life goals.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.120
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi,
I've got a new business!

12:49.200 --> 12:52.320
-What's your new business?
-I'm governor of this prison.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.840
How's business?

12:53.920 --> 12:56.120
I'm up to my neck in shit!

12:56.200 --> 12:58.520
-Okay, thank you.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.520
Let's settle down. Settle down.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.160
Thank you.
This is where we find ourselves.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.240
It is an unpleasant
and unfortunate situation.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.720
There is no two ways about that.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.440
My God, the smell has
really centralized in here, hasn't it?

13:12.520 --> 13:15.520
-Let us out then!
-Not possible just yet.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.360
As you know, it is standard protocol
when an alarm goes off.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.000
Plus, we need to make safe the corridor.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.120
-Come on!

13:24.200 --> 13:25.560
I didn't have a go yet.

13:25.640 --> 13:28.760
And as much as I like
to make your time in here enjoyable,

13:28.840 --> 13:30.000
it is not a theme park.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.320
If it was, it'd be Shit Mountain.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.920
Yes, and a quick update about that.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.200
Because most of the water
that arrived this morning is now depleted…

13:40.440 --> 13:44.840
…you will have to carry on using wet wipes
for personal hygiene.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.040
What? No!

13:48.240 --> 13:52.560
But there are also
emergency bottles of hand sanitizer,

13:52.640 --> 13:54.920
-so the situation…
-Shit-uation.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.600
Very good. …is under control.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.440
-Workmen are on site.
-Yes, come on!

14:01.520 --> 14:05.360
-Oh! Yes!

14:07.240 --> 14:09.880
So we are headed in the right direction.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.240
Look, we are all in this together.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.840
And we will get through it a lot quicker
if we work together as a team.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.400
Can we use
your portable toilet then, miss?

14:17.480 --> 14:19.120
No. We're not insured.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.640
Thank you, ladies.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.280
We're right behind you, Laura.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.520
It's like you said,
we'll get through it together.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.960
I'm coming.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.920
I get it.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.120
I can't smell anything.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.120
It smells quite nice today.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.840
Impossipuzzles. They're our thing.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.400
Mission Impossipuzzle? Not for us.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.960
We first bonded over a 10,000-piecer.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.400
We both went for the last piece
at the same time.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.320
Our eyes locked, and that was that.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.440
Imagine our surprise.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.000
We started
with a four-foot picture of a windmill.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.320
Look at us now,

15:02.400 --> 15:05.560
diving into baked beans
without so much as batting an eyelid.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.880
-I've got a corner.
-Oh, well done.

15:09.800 --> 15:13.160
I thought it was the top
of the bean, but it's the bottom.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.360
I'm such a noodle, aren't I?

15:15.440 --> 15:18.520
I think it's going to be a long day.

15:19.520 --> 15:24.760
-Let's play "Guess the Kardashians"!

15:24.840 --> 15:26.880
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.360
"I'm excited." You.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.600
Kourtney.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.120
-Kourtney?
-Mmm.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.440
I didn't say, "I'm excited."
I said, "I'm excited."

15:36.520 --> 15:37.720
Oh, yeah.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.600
I'll start again.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.320
"I'm excited."

15:41.800 --> 15:43.880
-Are you going to move, or what?
-Sorry?

15:43.960 --> 15:46.120
-I need to go past.
-Just go round her.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.040
I want to go this way.
This is my preferred route.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.040
"I'm excited!"

15:49.120 --> 15:50.960
Why have you got to be such a bitch
all the time?

15:51.040 --> 15:53.160
Move your fucking legs out of my way.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.360
Stand up for yourself.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.640
-"I'm excited."
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

15:56.720 --> 15:59.360
-It's got nothing to do with you.
-"I was married to Kanye West."

15:59.440 --> 16:01.520
Haven't you got a council flat
to apply for?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.320
-No, no, no.
-It's all right. I'm up now.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.520
-"I'm excited."
-Get the fuck back down, Ange.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.960
It was Kendall pretending to be Kim.

16:08.040 --> 16:12.560
You're ruining
my fucking concentration over here!

16:14.240 --> 16:16.880
-Are you going to be with us all day?
-I can certainly arrange it.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.720
-Result!
-We're all gonna die!

16:24.080 --> 16:27.760
-Oh, for goodness' sake, Doug! Every time!

16:27.840 --> 16:30.160
-Is that the same bucket?
-It is not.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.360
Okay, can we do something
about these alarms?

16:32.440 --> 16:34.720
Because that is grating, isn't it?

16:34.800 --> 16:37.720
Very unfriendly. Surely we can change it.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.560
Seventy percent of all prisons are
on budget and have running water.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.760
This prison is grossly over budget
and has no running water.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.640
And Laura wants to change the alarm…

16:52.880 --> 16:54.280
because it hurts her ears.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.880
What does Kanye ever get?

17:01.240 --> 17:03.560
Shut the fucking door!

17:03.640 --> 17:05.640
She shouldn't really be here, Vivian.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.400
I mean, I've got people in here
for tax evasion,

17:08.480 --> 17:11.040
and they're sharing a facility
with someone who, well,

17:11.119 --> 17:14.960
it would be wrong to discuss
an individual case, but…

17:15.760 --> 17:18.960
Let's just say someone was disemboweled

17:19.720 --> 17:20.880
by someone.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.960
Is the second someone Viv?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.040
Who could ever say?

17:26.240 --> 17:27.240
It's Viv.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.119
I mean, Christmas '86,

17:29.880 --> 17:32.319
that's your <i>EastEnders</i> golden era
right there.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.240
No offense, Cheryl.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.480
Are you still in touch with Minty?

17:40.080 --> 17:43.080
-Fuck off!

17:43.160 --> 17:44.160
Fuck off!

17:44.240 --> 17:45.760
Fuck off!

17:46.480 --> 17:49.120
All right, loves. It's over. It's over.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.320
Get back in your cells! It's over.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.000
Was that my fault? Did I cause this?

17:54.080 --> 17:56.040
Things can kick off
at any moment in here, Angela.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.720
-You need to be a bit more savvy.
-What does that mean?

17:58.800 --> 18:00.680
You stick out like a sore thumb.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.880
They can smell your weakness a mile off.
It's making you a target.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.320
But I don't know how else to be.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.080
I did tell you that wouldn't take long,
didn't I?

18:09.160 --> 18:11.440
Hello. Why is this inmate here?

18:11.520 --> 18:16.040
Ah. Cheryl. It's Cheryl.
I thought you were a different one.

18:16.120 --> 18:19.240
Anyway, sorry for the delay.
We had a few inmate-control issues.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.200
All sorted now.
And more good news.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.640
We've got a couple of industrial fans
up and running,

18:24.720 --> 18:26.880
which are dispersing
the worst of the smell.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.600
So, I think we can crack on
with rehearsals now,

18:29.680 --> 18:31.320
which will make a nice diversion
for everyone.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.880
You'll be lucky. I'm going home, dear.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.840
-Who's this fella?
-This is Martin. He's my musical director.

18:35.920 --> 18:39.240
Oh, amazing. Welcome, Martin.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.800
I know it's been a difficult day,

18:41.880 --> 18:43.680
but this is a wonderful thing
you're doing.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.920
This project will make a huge difference
to these women,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.040
and I just want to thank you in advance
for giving your time and talent

18:51.120 --> 18:53.280
in such a generous and selfless way.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.720
Society is all the better
for people like you.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.760
I found that very moving, actually.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.080
Right then. Once more unto the breach.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.880
Thanks, everyone, for showing an interest.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.080
First of all,
let's see what everyone can do.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.840
No pressure. Just have fun
and show us your best party trick.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.040
I'll go first.

19:38.560 --> 19:41.600
All right. Bit silly, I know.
But who's up next?

19:41.680 --> 19:43.520
-I'll go, Heather.
-Oh, Christ.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.840
Yay!

19:55.920 --> 19:57.640
That ended lovely.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.560
Thank you. Thank you.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.000
I mean, no, that doesn't-- Just-- There.
Wait a minute.

20:03.600 --> 20:07.000
Hello, my name is Suds.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.120
I work in the laundry.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
That's why they call me Suds.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.040
I look forward to being in your show.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.800
Thought I had one, but I haven't.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.560
Yay!

20:41.640 --> 20:43.520
-Whoa!

20:46.920 --> 20:48.280
Nice balloon!

20:48.360 --> 20:51.360
Well, it sounds like you've all
been having a lot of fun in here.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.760
First prize goes to whoever it was
doing those screechy animal impressions.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.000
I could hear those all the way down
to the end of the corridor.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.080
That was Jill the Canary
singing "Mull of Kintyre."

21:00.960 --> 21:02.200
Beautiful.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.520
Anyway, thank you all
for your cooperation today.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.040
Now, it's not on the timetable,

21:09.120 --> 21:11.760
but I think it's only fair,
before dinner is served,

21:11.840 --> 21:13.240
you all run out into the yard

21:13.320 --> 21:15.840
and grab yourselves
a lungful or two of fresh air.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.960
Before you go though, please remember,
hygiene, hygiene, hygiene.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.480
Hello, hello, hello.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.440
I wasn't actually saying "hi"
to you, Jean, but hello.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.720
And also, please don't forget,

21:30.800 --> 21:33.960
grab a bottle of hand sanitizer
as you leave.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.720
-What's it smell like in here, Gal?
-It stinks like shit.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.000
It always makes him laugh.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.560
I mean, we're all round,
gagging around the place.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.480
-He's giggling. He thinks it's funny.
-It stinks like shit.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.240
It does.
It stinks like shit. And it's hot.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.440
It's 'cause he's not allowed
to say that usually.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.840
Well, I don't swear that much.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.560
Only when he's on the telly.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.920
There's only one word for it.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.200
Shit.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.880
The air is thick with

22:21.720 --> 22:23.920
-shite.
-Shit.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.480
-He's at it again. Anything'll get him.
-I just…

22:29.160 --> 22:33.080
Look at these women.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

22:33.160 --> 22:36.080
-Depends what you're thinking.
-Just how much potential they have.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.880
Oh. No. No.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.840
-They look happy, though.
-Yeah.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.240
And that's a start.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.040
Whoo!

22:53.120 --> 22:54.240
Is that…

22:56.600 --> 22:57.880
Oh, God.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.320
-You know that hand sanitizer?
-Yes, they've drank it.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.080
Lucky he wears cheap clothes.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.160
Crisis over. Pipes fixed. Water's back on.

24:17.840 --> 24:20.120
We live to fight another day.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.440
I mean, how does she get away with it?

24:27.680 --> 24:29.920
It was just a great day today.
It was just a great day.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.080
Packed with craic today, it was.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.320
If you've got any photos of today, I put
them up on here, on my wall of fame.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.240
Do you see it? All the memories.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.880
All the memories that my mammy gave me.

24:41.560 --> 24:45.560
She's not been able to visit me. Not much.
Not since I've been here, anyway.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.240
And that'll break her heart
because I know she hates to disappoint me.

24:48.840 --> 24:52.040
She's coming soon 'cause she can't wait
to come and see me in <i>West Side Story</i> .

24:52.120 --> 24:54.000
I'm gonna make her really proud.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.920
That's the camper van
of me and my mammy's dreams.

24:57.960 --> 25:01.040
That's not the man of my dreams,
but he's the one buying me the camper van,

25:01.120 --> 25:04.360
and I'm going camping with me mammy in it.

25:05.320 --> 25:09.120
Do you see that? That bus ticket?
You know what that's from?

25:09.200 --> 25:12.280
My mammy came to pick me up
from school that day, and I kept it.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.480
One adult for my mammy
and one single for the child.

25:16.560 --> 25:20.440
Two, please. Two tickets.
That's what they did.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.400
Saw this. I don't know who that is.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.480
I don't know who that was.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.080
But my mammy's coming soon!
