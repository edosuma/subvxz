06:54.789 --> 06:56.707

07:03.214 --> 07:04.507
RIGHT UP TO THE POINT
WHERE I DON'T.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.468

07:07.552 --> 07:10.012

A BRIDGE.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.556

07:11.639 --> 07:13.891
THAT'S A BRIDGE TO NOWHERE.

TO GIVE GABBY A LITTLE FREEDOM

07:18.563 --> 07:20.690
WITHOUT SACRIFICING
YOUR PEACE OF MIND.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.943
- YOU MEAN, LIKE,
PUTTING A CHIP IN HER?

07:24.026 --> 07:25.528
- OR WE COULD LET HER
TAKE BABY STEPS

07:27.113 --> 07:29.615

07:31.409 --> 07:33.995
WHERE WE DON'T DO ANY OF THAT.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.705
- GABBY'S A GOOD GIRL
WITH GOOD JUDGMENT.

07:35.788 --> 07:39.041
NAME ME ONE GIRL HER AGE
AS RESPONSIBLE AS SHE IS.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.044

07:51.470 --> 07:53.890

- YES!

07:53.973 --> 07:55.433
I'M A BRIDGE.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.811
- I GUESS I SHOULDN'T
WORRY SO MUCH.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.646
WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB
WITH GABBY.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.398
- YEAH, SHE'S A GREAT GIRL.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.275
- DID YOU KNOW
THAT EVEN AS WE SPEAK,

08:04.358 --> 08:07.486
SHE'S VOLUNTEERING
AT A NURSING HOME?

08:07.570 --> 08:10.823
- SHE'S WHATTING AT A WHAT-WHAT?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.662
- I WAS GONNA
ORGANIZE YOUR SPICES.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.455
THEN I SAW
THAT YOU HAD NO SPICES,

08:17.538 --> 08:20.166
SO I BOUGHT YOU SOME SPICES,

08:20.249 --> 08:24.170
AND HERE ARE YOUR SPICES.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.213
- THANKS, MOM.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.464
- OOH...

08:26.547 --> 08:30.218
DID I JUST HEAR GRATITUDE
WITHOUT ANY ATTITUDE?

08:30.301 --> 08:31.260
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.385
- JUST MOM TROUBLES.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.763
- WHAT DID I DO?

08:33.846 --> 08:36.265
I JUST BOUGHT YOU SOME SPICES.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.059
- NOT HAVING-A-MOM TROUBLES.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.020
BEING-A-MOM TROUBLES.

08:41.102 --> 08:43.731
- OH.
WHICH KID THIS TIME?

08:43.813 --> 08:44.941
- GABBY.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.609
CHARLIE WON'T LET HER DATE
THIS BOY, OWEN,

08:46.692 --> 08:48.611
SO I KIND OF TOLD HER
HOW I GOT AROUND YOUR DUMB RULE

08:48.694 --> 08:49.737
BY DOING VOLUNTEER WORK
WITH BOYS.

08:49.820 --> 08:53.032
AND THEN SHE TOOK MY STORY
AS A SUGGESTION,

08:53.115 --> 08:55.618
SO NOW I'M GOING TO BE
IN TROUBLE.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.786
- SLOW YOUR ROLL, LITTLE GIRL,

08:56.869 --> 08:59.956
'CAUSE YOU ALREADY
IN TROUBLE.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.290
WHEN YOU WERE VOLUNTEERING,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.209
IT WAS JUST TO BE
WITH SOME BOY?

09:03.292 --> 09:06.671
- UM, YEAH,
BUT WE'RE NOT ON ME RIGHT NOW.

09:06.754 --> 09:11.342
- OH, WE ARE
ALL OVER YOU RIGHT NOW.

09:11.425 --> 09:12.301
VOLUNTEERING
AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER?

09:12.385 --> 09:15.137
- I WAS MAKING OUT WITH LARRY.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.181
- FOOD DRIVE?
- MAKING OUT WITH MATT.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.474
- SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND?

09:18.557 --> 09:19.642
- OH, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.854
WE JUST HAD TO BE REAL QUIET.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.147
- GET ME A WOODEN SPOON.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.025
- OH, REALLY?
YOU'RE GONNA TRY AND SPANK ME?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.485
- NO, I'M GOING TO MIX UP

09:29.568 --> 09:31.320
A BATCH OF SANGRIA
AND ENJOY THIS.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.073
I DON'T NEED TO PUNISH YOU,

09:34.156 --> 09:38.411
'CAUSE KARMA IS GONNA
TAKE YOU TO THE WOODSHED.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.372
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.124
I'M BACK
WITH MY CHARITABLE PRINCESS.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.501
[both laughing]

09:45.584 --> 09:46.919
YEAH, ISN'T SHE SOMETHING?

09:47.003 --> 09:49.880
- OH, SHE'S SOMETHING ALL RIGHT.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.382
- AW, THANK YOU.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.758
- I'M GONNA GO TAKE A SHOWER.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.343
FIVE MINUTES
IN THAT NURSING HOME

09:54.427 --> 09:58.180
AND I SMELL LIKE BENGAY
AND WORLD WAR II.

09:58.264 --> 09:58.848
- HEY, GABBY,
CAN YOU HOLD ON A MINUTE?

09:58.931 --> 10:00.975
- SURE.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.561
- MOM, DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMEPLACE TO BE?

10:03.644 --> 10:06.230
- YUP, AND I'M IN IT.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.315
- MOTHER.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.358
- OKAY, FINE.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.193
I'LL LEAVE
THE THREE OF YOU ALONE--

10:11.277 --> 10:13.738
YOU, GABBY, AND OLD MAN KARMA.

10:16.949 --> 10:21.037
- SO I HEAR YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING
WITH THE ELDERLY.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.664
- LIKE THEY SAY,
CHARITY DOES BEGIN AT THE HOME.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.166
- HMM.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAY.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.043
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.378
YOU TOOK A STORY ABOUT
SOMETHING FROM WHEN I WAS 16--

10:29.462 --> 10:30.504
TWO YEARS OLDER THAN YOU--

10:30.588 --> 10:33.716
AND THEN USED IT
TO GO BEHIND MY BACK.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.468
WHILE I WAS BUILDING A BRIDGE,

10:35.551 --> 10:37.553
YOU WERE TUNNELING UNDER IT
WITH OWEN.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.096
- OH, OWEN IS OVER.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.557
I CAUGHT HIM CLEANING OUT
A BEDPAN WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.309
HE IS SUCH A PLAYER.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.227
BUT THERE IS THIS OTHER
VOLUNTEER, JEREMY,

10:45.311 --> 10:46.395
WHO'S KIND OF CUTE.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.980
- OH.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.191
NO.
YOU CANNOT DO THIS EVER AGAIN.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.275
- HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT WITH BOYS?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.402
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

10:53.486 --> 10:55.571
I GOT YOUR DAD TO AGREE
TO GROUP DATES.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.864
- SERIOUSLY?
STEPH, HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

10:56.947 --> 11:00.743
- I TOLD HIM HOW MATURE
AND RESPONSIBLE YOU ARE.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.496
- OOPS.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.456
- LOOK, IF YOUR DAD
FINDS OUT ABOUT OWEN,

11:05.539 --> 11:07.583
I'LL LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT
FOR GOING TO BAT FOR YOU,

11:07.666 --> 11:09.794
AND YOU WILL NEVER DATE AGAIN.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.338
- SO WHAT DO WE DO?

11:12.421 --> 11:13.381
- [sighs]

11:13.464 --> 11:15.341
WE KEEP THIS OWEN STUFF
TO OURSELVES.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.094
- OWEN WHO?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.388
[doorbell rings]

11:20.471 --> 11:22.473
- HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

11:22.556 --> 11:24.308
- OWEN?
- OWEN.

11:24.392 --> 11:24.809
- OWEN!

11:30.523 --> 11:32.149
- GABBY, WE ARE MEANT TO BE.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.651
- I'M OUT.

11:33.734 --> 11:34.402
- GABBY, DON'T LET A BEDPAN
COME BETWEEN US.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.861
- IT WASN'T THE BEDPAN.

11:35.945 --> 11:40.032
IT WAS THE CHICK
IN THE CHEETAH PRINT HOLDING IT.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.202
- GABBY!

11:43.285 --> 11:45.454
- OWEN, YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY NICE GUY--

11:45.538 --> 11:48.791
AND A WOODWIND TO BOOT.

11:48.874 --> 11:49.834
THERE ARE PLENTY OF FISH

11:49.917 --> 11:51.210
AND A WHOLE LOT
OF OTHER CLICHES,

11:51.293 --> 11:52.837
BUT THE TAKEAWAY HERE IS,
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.463
- NO, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE

11:54.547 --> 11:55.965
UNTIL GABBY GIVES ME
ANOTHER CHANCE.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.008
- NO ONE HERE
HAS THAT KIND OF TIME.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.553
- I DO.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.638
- GABBY!

12:02.721 --> 12:04.098
- I'M GONNA GO TALK TO GABBY.

12:04.181 --> 12:05.349
OWEN, CHILL OUT.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.852
MOM, STOP GLOATING.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.145
- I CAN'T.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.940
SOMETIMES KARMA
PLAYS A CLARINET.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.444
- [whistling]

12:16.527 --> 12:18.529
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:18.612 --> 12:19.613
- UH, WHY?
DO I NEED A HALL PASS?

12:19.697 --> 12:22.116
- [chuckles]
OH, OF COURSE NOT.

12:22.199 --> 12:25.995
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHY MY EXTREMELY SEXY HUSBAND

12:26.078 --> 12:27.496
WOULD CHOOSE TO LEAVE
THE BEDROOM

12:27.580 --> 12:29.999
WHEN I MIGHT SHOW UP
AT ANY TIME.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.168
- BECAUSE HISTORICALLY,

12:32.251 --> 12:36.005
4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON
HASN'T BEEN MAGIC HOUR.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.256
- IT'S LIKE THE LOTTERY.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.009
YOU CAN'T WIN
IF YOU DON'T PLAY.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.637
- YOU TALKING POWER BUCKS
OR JUST A SCRATCH-OFF?

12:43.721 --> 12:45.723
- EITHER WAY,
YOU'LL BE SHOUTING, "JACKPOT."

12:45.806 --> 12:47.558
SO GET BACK IN THERE.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.143
- OH, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT ANY OF THAT MEANT,

12:49.226 --> 12:51.103
BUT I'LL GIVE IT TEN MINUTES.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.609
- GABBY, GET DOWNSTAIRS
AND TALK TO THIS BOY.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.860
- CAN YOU DO IT?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.236
- I'M NOT THE ONE
HE'S CRYING OVER.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.823
- HE'S CRYING?
PLEASE, CAN YOU DO IT?

13:02.907 --> 13:04.492
- HEY, WHO'S THAT DUDE
CURLED UP IN A BALL

13:04.575 --> 13:06.410
THAT GRANDMA MAGGIE'S PETTING?

13:06.494 --> 13:08.078
- NOW HE'S IN A BALL?

13:08.162 --> 13:11.373
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
LIKE, ROLL HIM OUT OF HERE?

13:11.457 --> 13:12.958
- IF YOU HAVE TO.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.710
I THINK YOUR DAD'S ONTO US.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.881
- I CAN GET HIM OUT.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.090
- HOW?

13:20.174 --> 13:21.717
- I'LL JUST TELL HIM
ALL ABOUT THE REAL YOU--

13:21.800 --> 13:26.388
"GABBY UNPLUGGED,"
IF YOU WILL.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.140
- OKAY, BUT JUST ENOUGH
TO SCARE HIM AWAY--

13:28.224 --> 13:31.268
NOT SO MUCH THAT I CAN'T
SHOW UP AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.355
- DOABLE, BUT I'M GONNA WANT
SOMETHING FIRST.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.565
I WON'T SAY WHERE.
I WON'T SAY WHEN.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.152
BUT IT'S IN THE OTHER ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.572
DON'T TOUCH MY TURTLE.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.740
- I NEED HIM BACK.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.283
WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE?

13:46.367 --> 13:47.576
- WELL, I'LL GIVE HIM BACK
TO YOU FOR--

13:47.660 --> 13:49.411
AND I'M JUST SPITBALLING HERE--

13:49.495 --> 13:52.498
YOUR HALF OF THE ROOM.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.251
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.585
- I GUESS
YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF

13:56.669 --> 13:57.670
HOW MUCH LEONARDO'S
REALLY WORTH TO YOU.

13:57.753 --> 14:00.130
- I CAN'T SLEEP WITHOUT HIM.

14:00.214 --> 14:00.881
SEE THESE BAGS?

14:00.965 --> 14:04.552
I LOOK LIKE I'M 12.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.387
CAN'T WE JUST TRADE BACK?

14:06.470 --> 14:07.429
- THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.182
THE TURTLE AND I HAVE BONDED.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.643
- I DON'T KNOW.
GABBY, SHOULD I DO IT?

14:12.726 --> 14:15.437
- YEAH, GABBY.
SHOULD HE DO IT?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.694
- IT KILLS ME TO SAY THIS,
BUT...

14:21.777 --> 14:23.696
HECK YES.

14:23.779 --> 14:24.780
- THERE YOU GO.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.115
AND YOU KNOW
YOU CAN TRUST GABBY.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.659
SHE HELPS OLD PEOPLE.

14:30.369 --> 14:35.791
- OWEN, LET'S TALK ABOUT
A LITTLE THING CALLED DIGNITY.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.253
- YOU SOUND JUST LIKE
MY GUIDANCE COUNSELOR.

14:39.336 --> 14:42.089
GABBY!

14:45.134 --> 14:47.678
- OWEN, BUDDY,
LET ME ASK YOU--

14:47.761 --> 14:49.930
HOW MUCH DO YOU REALLY KNOW
ABOUT GABBY?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.390
- WHO ARE YOU?

14:51.473 --> 14:53.225
- I'M THE GUY WHO'S GONNA
PULL BACK THE CURTAIN

14:53.309 --> 14:55.561
AS ONLY A BROTHER CAN.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.938
GABBY'S MIDDLE NAME
IS BEATRICE.

14:58.022 --> 15:02.610
HER FAVORITE FOOD
IS LIVER AND ONIONS.

15:02.693 --> 15:07.156
SHE USED TRAINING WHEELS
UNTIL SHE WAS NINE.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.325
STILL HERE?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.660
GUESS I GOT TO BRING OUT
THE BIG GUNS.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.245
WE BEGIN OUR LITTLE PHOTO TOUR

15:13.329 --> 15:16.248
WITH WHAT I CALL
THE HEADGEAR YEARS.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.294
- AW, GABBY...

15:23.589 --> 15:28.177
- COULDN'T CRACK HIM,
AND I USED ALL MY BEST STUFF.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.680
I SAY WE JUST BUY A NEW SOFA.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.724
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS AND TALK TO HIM.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.142
- I CAN'T HANDLE THIS DRAMA.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.436
IT'S GOING TO BE
AWKWARD AND MISERABLE.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.731
- UH, HELLO, WELCOME TO DATING.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.691
SEE, THIS IS THE PROBLEM
WITH GOING OUT WITH GUYS

15:42.775 --> 15:44.026
BEFORE YOU'RE READY.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.446
- REALLY, A TEACHABLE MOMENT?
NOW?

15:47.529 --> 15:50.824
- THAT BOY IS NOT LEAVING
OUR HOUSE UNTIL YOU TWO

15:50.908 --> 15:53.702
HAVE A DEEPER CONVERSATION THAN,
"I'M OUT."

15:53.786 --> 15:56.538
AND YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES
TO CLEAN UP THIS OWEN MESS

15:56.622 --> 15:57.790
BEFORE YOUR DAD STEPS IN IT.

15:57.873 --> 15:58.707
- STEPH, I WOULD TALK TO HIM,

15:58.791 --> 15:59.833
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.586
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.296
- BE SIMPLE AND DIRECT.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.674
IT'S ACTUALLY THE KINDEST THING
YOU CAN DO FOR HIM.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.717
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO THAT.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.512
HOW DO I DO THAT?

16:11.595 --> 16:12.680
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S PRACTICE.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.431
I'LL BE OWEN, OKAY?
- OKAY.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.392
- "GABBY, I LOVE YOU."

16:16.475 --> 16:16.975
- I'M OUT.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.525
- DON'T WORRY.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.944
- I GOT IT.

16:27.027 --> 16:30.406
OWEN, I'M GOING TO SAY THIS
VERY SIMPLY.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.573
- CHARLIE!

16:31.657 --> 16:33.701
- I'M OUT.
- GABBY!

16:33.784 --> 16:35.369
- OWEN,
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.747
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT TOO.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.792
- I SEE YOU'VE MET OWEN.
- YES.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.210
APPARENTLY, HE WENT OUT
ON A DATE WITH GABBY,

16:43.293 --> 16:47.089
WHO--BEST I CAN RECALL--
ISN'T ALLOWED TO DATE.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.382
- BEFORE YOU BLAME GABBY--

16:48.465 --> 16:50.926
WHICH IS WHERE
THIS SHOULD END UP--

16:51.009 --> 16:53.387
I MIGHT HAVE PLAYED
AN INADVERTENT PART.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.763
- SO I'VE HEARD.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.559
- I TRIED TO KEEP HIM
FROM HEARING ME SAY IT.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.102
- I WAS SO BUSY
BUILDING A BRIDGE

17:00.185 --> 17:01.437
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT--

17:01.520 --> 17:03.605
- THAT A TEENAGE GIRL WOULD HEAR
WHAT SHE WANTED TO HEAR

17:03.689 --> 17:04.857
AND USE IT TO HER ADVANTAGE?

17:04.940 --> 17:08.569
OWEN, YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT
TO THE TOP.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.362
- I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

17:10.445 --> 17:13.073
BUT I WAS SO EMBARRASSED
I GOT PLAYED.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.159
- YEAH, WELL, WE ALL GET PLAYED.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.328
SOMEHOW JAMES HAS
ALL MY FREQUENT-FLIER MILES.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.705
- [playing <i> Battle Hymn</i>
<i>of the Republic]</i>

17:20.789 --> 17:25.002
- OH, HONEY, OWEN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:25.085 --> 17:28.297
- I'M SPEAKING TO GABBY
THROUGH MY MUSIC.

17:28.380 --> 17:33.177
- SOMEBODY NEEDS TO EXPLAIN
REALITY TO THIS KID.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.053
- I WOULDN'T GET MY HOPES UP.

17:35.137 --> 17:35.804
- THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.557
IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.186
- OWEN, WERE YOU PLAYING THAT
FOR ME?

17:42.269 --> 17:44.062
- YES, I WAS TRYING TO CONVEY
THAT I'M SORRY

17:44.146 --> 17:46.774
ABOUT THE OTHER GIRL
AND THE BEDPAN.

17:46.857 --> 17:50.611
- THAT TOTALLY CAME ACROSS.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.738
- IT'S A SONG
ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.366
- SO DOES THIS MEAN THAT
YOU'LL GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.076
- OKAY, LET'S TRY AGAIN.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.161
- YES!

17:59.244 --> 18:00.913
- WE COULD BUILD HOUSES
FOR THE HOMELESS.

18:00.996 --> 18:01.872
- EVEN BETTER!

18:01.955 --> 18:02.956
- SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN--

18:03.040 --> 18:04.208
IN EXACTLY 23 MONTHS.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.001
I'LL BUY YOU BOTH HAMMERS.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.046
- BYE, GABBY--
