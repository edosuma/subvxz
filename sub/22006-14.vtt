WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.328
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:03.370 --> 00:04.462
Last man!

00:06.170 --> 00:08.661
Team Echo was on their
second mission of the night.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.167
ERIC:
They breached the structure.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.075
Seconds later,
there was an explosion.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.270
So you're
telling me that all...

00:13.310 --> 00:16.279
six members
of Echo Team are dead.

00:16.310 --> 00:19.074
Command has asked that your
date of deployment be moved up.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.473
You leave in 18 hours.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.545
Your other family has got
too tight a hold.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.285
I can't share you anymore.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.788
I don't think
I should be your wife.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.651
Tariq Jamala.

00:28.690 --> 00:31.329
MANDY: Well, if our guys
did get led into a trap,

00:31.360 --> 00:33.157
Tariq's the one
who led them there,

00:33.200 --> 00:34.827
The last phone call he made,

00:34.860 --> 00:37.067
to Azim Raisani, 19.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.091
Tariq fell in love
with this kid Azim.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.391
Deke said the neighborhood's
pretty hostile, boss.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.067
We go in, we go out,

00:42.110 --> 00:43.566
we get the kid, and we're gone.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.193
Any of you guys
getting the willies?

01:10.230 --> 01:12.630
Yeah, too much history here.

01:12.670 --> 01:15.195
TRENT: How many times do you
think we've been to J

01:15.240 --> 01:18.107
Too many times.

01:18.140 --> 01:21.132
TOC, this is Bravo 1 proceeding
north on Mazari Road.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.273
Copy, Bravo 1,
I've got you on Mazari Road.

01:23.310 --> 01:25.676
Your target is approximately
800 meters on your left.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.474
Copy that.

01:31.850 --> 01:35.183
Boss, I do not like
the looks of these guys.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.482
CLAY:
You know, first thing

01:36.530 --> 01:38.350
they told me
on my first deployment--

01:38.390 --> 01:39.618
you get into
a hostile neighborhood,

01:39.660 --> 01:42.823
you schwack the guy
on the phone.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.395
Yeah, what about when
they all got phones?

01:45.430 --> 01:46.590
SONNY :
Schwack 'em all.

01:48.470 --> 01:51.337
RAY: Yeah, that'll win you
some hearts and minds, Sonny.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.501
JASON:
Right there.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.787
TOC, you see us?

02:04.820 --> 02:07.311
Copy, Bravo 1.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.509
You are clear for entry.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.358
Copy that. Let's go.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.394
JASON: Move, move,
move, move, move!

02:17.430 --> 02:20.433
I got my eyes on you,
little buddy.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.734
Last time a team went to one
of Tariq's properties,
whole place blew up.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.533
That's why we're
doing this right.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.215
Last man.

03:18.630 --> 03:19.699
Hey, hey.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.591
Get out!
Get out!

03:22.630 --> 03:24.621
Get on the floor.

03:24.670 --> 03:25.989
Azim, Azim, Azim!

03:26.030 --> 03:27.429
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

03:27.470 --> 03:28.630
We got Azim.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.399
DAVIS:
Copy, Bravo 2.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.634
Be advised, unknown vehicle

03:31.670 --> 03:33.399
approaching
your target location.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.601
Davis, get rid
of the Scooby vans now.

03:38.650 --> 03:41.312
Copy. Moving vans
to standby location.

03:50.490 --> 03:51.559
Okay, we got 'em.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.919
SONNY: Little buddy's
on the move.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.598
Ain't that a surprise.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.511
Brock, what is it?

04:14.550 --> 04:16.518
The wind's coming from the
direction of the vehicle.

04:16.550 --> 04:18.689
Saying the vehicle's
an IED?
I'm saying it's
got explosives

04:18.720 --> 04:21.314
in it.
Residue?

04:21.360 --> 04:23.988
It could be, but it'd have
to be a lot of residue.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.525
I don't like these guys, boss.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.620
DAVIS: Bravo 1,
I'm seeing several men...

04:30.670 --> 04:32.831
make that many men--
converging on your position.

04:32.870 --> 04:33.939
Where?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.536
From everywhere.

04:37.570 --> 04:39.629
First week in-country...

04:39.680 --> 04:41.534
Let's not make it our last.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.502
TOC, this is 1 requesting
immediate CAS.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.574
Danger close.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.874
Bravo 1, be advised,
we have limited air support.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.740
Nearest helo
is still refueling, J-Bad.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.611
ETA your position, ten minutes.

04:54.590 --> 04:55.318
Incoming!

05:03.570 --> 05:05.595
JASON:
Everybody okay?!
ALL: Yeah!

05:05.630 --> 05:07.439
Yeah, we're all good!

05:14.980 --> 05:17.801
Figure they don't know he's up
here or they don't give a damn!

05:21.750 --> 05:24.583
Yeah, I'm starting to think
they want him dead, too!

05:29.990 --> 05:32.925
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
How close are we to CAS?

05:32.960 --> 05:35.497
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

05:35.530 --> 05:36.724
Close Air Support
is still delayed,

05:36.770 --> 05:37.998
but I've got an exfil helo
that says

05:38.030 --> 05:40.533
he can make it to an L2
approximately two klicks

05:40.570 --> 05:42.504
southwest of your position
in 12 mikes.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.641
Roger. What's the L2?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.716
It's an open field
just off the Kabul Highway.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.718
I'm gonna send a GPS grid
to the drivers.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.684
Copy that! We'll meet you there!

06:04.890 --> 06:08.428
Vans, move to the west alley.
Prepare for a hot exfil.

06:09.430 --> 06:11.091
Time to get out of Dodge, Jace!

06:14.470 --> 06:16.802
CLAY: Hey, hey! Three guys!
Three guys up close!

06:16.840 --> 06:18.637
They're in front!
Close! Close up!

06:18.670 --> 06:20.137
On it! Give me a frag!

06:23.810 --> 06:26.608
Frag out!

06:26.650 --> 06:27.719
Frag out!

06:32.560 --> 06:34.380
Smoke!

06:35.090 --> 06:36.648
Prep for exfil!

06:43.800 --> 06:45.461
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:45.500 --> 06:47.764
Hey, get up! Get up!

06:47.800 --> 06:49.631
Hey! Hey!

06:50.670 --> 06:51.830
Huh?

06:51.870 --> 06:54.077
G0, 90, 90, 90, 90!
Right, let's go!

07:01.780 --> 07:03.941
Van's gonna be here
in 30 seconds.

07:10.890 --> 07:12.755
*

07:19.770 --> 07:21.761
Smoke ready.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.639
Exfil, exfil, exfil.

07:36.950 --> 07:39.555
Last man.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.785
*

07:47.830 --> 07:50.628
Last man!

07:58.810 --> 07:59.970
Last man!

08:00.010 --> 08:02.069
Go! Go!

08:05.550 --> 08:06.574
Hup,hup.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.145
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

08:13.960 --> 08:16.087
TOC, exfil'ing now.
Heading to L2.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.844
MANDY: You made it.
Yeah, well, hope he's worth it,

08:39.880 --> 08:41.017
'cause we got our asses shot up.

08:41.050 --> 08:43.917
Tariq Jamala walked our guys
into a booby-trapped house.

08:43.950 --> 08:46.714
Azim was the last person
to talk to him. He's worth it.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.751
Let me know what you find out.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.199
He says Tariq
was not a terrorist.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.698
Tariq's burner phone had calls
from several numbers

08:57.730 --> 08:59.266
associated
with the Halani Network.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.791
It's how we got to him
in the first place.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.808
(translates
in Pashto)

09:05.240 --> 09:06.878
He says that's a lie.
We also know

09:06.910 --> 09:08.707
he called you the night he died.

09:08.740 --> 09:11.174
The night he led our men
to their deaths.

09:11.210 --> 09:14.213
(translates
in Pashto)

09:24.730 --> 09:27.153
So, after nearly getting
our asses shot off

09:27.200 --> 09:30.169
bringing this guy in, Azim,
it turns out being a dead end?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.998
Never understand why a gay
man would become a jihadi,

09:33.040 --> 09:35.691
fight alongside guys who'd
throw you off a building

09:35.740 --> 09:37.367
if they knew who
you really are.
Well, they probably knew

09:37.410 --> 09:38.832
that the two of them
were lovers.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.599
I mean, the way
they shot up that house,

09:40.640 --> 09:42.676
they weren't too concerned
about Azim's safety.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.803
And it could be they just didn't
want him to be taken alive,

09:44.850 --> 09:46.772
want to give him
a chance to flip.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.879
Look, you settled in?

09:48.920 --> 09:50.319
I dropped my bags
off somewhere.

09:50.350 --> 09:51.988
I haven't been back since.

09:52.020 --> 09:54.386
Are you gonna sleep
at all this deployment?

09:54.420 --> 09:57.150
I'm sending you out every
night to risk your lives.

09:57.190 --> 09:59.158
Yeah, I'm gonna take
overtime to make sure

09:59.190 --> 10:00.748
I'm sending you to
the right targets.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.620
Eh.
WOMAN:
Hello, sir.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.262
Heya.

10:06.270 --> 10:08.830
What?

10:08.870 --> 10:12.806
Nothing. I just forget that
you guys are rock stars here.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.172
"I wonder
if he's the one who shot Osama."

10:15.210 --> 10:17.872
Alana filed for divorce.

10:17.910 --> 10:21.914
I'm... I'm so sorry. I...

10:23.420 --> 10:24.785
You want
to talk about it?
No.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.287
No.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.924
You ever wonder how
many tImes you've slept

10:36.970 --> 10:38.767
in a dead man's bed?

10:38.800 --> 10:42.861
SONNY: Never a friend's bed,
like Echo Team.

10:42.910 --> 10:46.038
Senior guys get
bottom bunk.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.129
Damn right.

10:57.950 --> 10:58.780
Hey, dawg.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.879
Hey...
Hey...

11:00.920 --> 11:02.182
What time is
it back home?

11:02.220 --> 11:03.926
What time is it
back home?

11:03.960 --> 11:05.450
It'd be, uh,
12:30 am.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.321
Were you just
e

11:07.360 --> 11:08.452
Yeah.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.162
You all right?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.236
I need the AARs from Echo.

11:13.270 --> 11:14.828
That's not answering
my question.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.394
Don't need to be taken care of
here, buddy.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.839
Hell you don't.

11:17.870 --> 11:20.703
AARs-- hand 'em over.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.040
Thank you.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.913
Sleep isn't
a weakness, Jason.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.815
BROCK:
Here, boy. Hup.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.885
CLAY: Hey, it doesn't bother you
how we're gonna make

11:36.930 --> 11:38.329
our only teammate with no arms
climb a ladder?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.998
Not me.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.292
I think it's awesome.

12:12.060 --> 12:14.199
This is why you label
your stuff.

12:14.230 --> 12:15.492
I label everything.

12:15.530 --> 12:16.827
Look, I can't help you

12:16.870 --> 12:18.098
unless you
follow protocol

12:18.130 --> 12:19.961
and you check in
your cases with me

12:20.000 --> 12:21.365
before we get
on to the plane.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.004
Brock.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.463
I have a system.
What do you want me to say?

12:25.510 --> 12:27.330
I'm gonna look around for
it, but it's not because

12:27.380 --> 12:29.109
I think it's my fault
that it got lost.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.448
It's because I don't
want your partner

12:30.480 --> 12:31.879
to suffer for
your Incompetence.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.946
Okay.
Okay.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.413
Keep looking.

12:37.450 --> 12:40.988
MAN :
Green sector,
go ahead and report in.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.124
How long till your tech guys
are gonna ID this bomb maker?

12:43.160 --> 12:44.855
MANDY:
There wasn't a lot
left to work with,

12:44.890 --> 12:46.482
and they're going
as fast as they can.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.191
They're not going as fast as
they can. If they were going

12:48.230 --> 12:50.027
as fast as they can, we would
know that by now, all right?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.867
Whoever did this was
a professional bomb maker.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.197
All you have to do is look

12:53.240 --> 12:56.391
at the ISR video and know
whoever wired that house

12:56.440 --> 12:58.237
was a pro!

13:06.010 --> 13:08.012
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:08.050 --> 13:10.143
Ijust...

13:10.190 --> 13:13.387
Look, I know that you want this
target just as bad as we do.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.411
Apology accepted.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.859
Look, you're right.

13:16.890 --> 13:19.256
That was a professional hit.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.155
We're gonna find the guy
behind it.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.225
And then we're gonna find
the guy behind him

13:23.270 --> 13:25.261
and the guy behind him
because that's what we do.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.098
Look, I went through
Echo Team's AARs

13:28.140 --> 13:30.563
to see if they ever
came across Tariq and Azim,

13:30.610 --> 13:32.931
and they never came
across anything.

13:34.910 --> 13:38.107
You know they have us sleeping
in Echo Team's bunks.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.277
We're sleeping in their bunks.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.619
How are the guys?

13:45.650 --> 13:49.450
Trying not to think
about it much.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.321
Got their head in their gear.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.295
That's probably smart.

13:54.330 --> 13:55.991
How about your gear?

13:56.030 --> 13:59.363
Just find me that bomber.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.449
Hey, you got any
extra pelican cases?

14:11.480 --> 14:12.606
Hold on. I'm almost
done filling these.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.345
Ray.
Hold on.

14:14.380 --> 14:15.938
You okay?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.208
You try and
re-encrypt the radio,

14:17.250 --> 14:18.911
the key doesn't work,
and we're out comms.

14:18.950 --> 14:20.110
You think that's okay?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.616
I asked if you were okay.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.549
No, Lisa, I don't
have any extra cases.

14:24.590 --> 14:27.297
All right.

14:27.330 --> 14:29.025
Damn.

14:29.060 --> 14:30.618
Don't let him bug you;
he just gets all obsessed

14:30.670 --> 14:32.422
over these comms.
Mm-hmm.

14:32.470 --> 14:35.530
Yeah. I'm probably too concerned
with the equipment we use

14:35.570 --> 14:37.606
to call in medevacs,
air support.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.130
Doesn't matter.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.979
So, uh, what
you looking for?

14:41.010 --> 14:42.432
Brock lost a pelican case.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.074
Well, not so much as lost as he
neglected to use the system.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.247
Oh, well, you got
to have a system.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.918
That's what I told him.

14:47.950 --> 14:49.417
You sure you
weren't distracted?

14:49.450 --> 14:50.986
Huh?
Excuse me?

14:51.020 --> 14:51.987
Mm-hmm.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.578
You see, I'm
missing my hydrogel,

14:53.620 --> 14:55.952
and, well, that's
never happened before.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.982
So I'm just trying to think,
you know, what's different?

14:59.030 --> 15:01.396
Yeah, okay. Are you seriously
coming at me right now

15:01.430 --> 15:03.694
about, what, hydrogel?

15:03.730 --> 15:05.698
Well, I mean, I, myself
have been distracted, but...

15:05.730 --> 15:07.459
Sonny, you wouldn't
be able to find hydrogel

15:07.500 --> 15:10.207
if it was stuck to your ass.
Oh, look at that.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.639
Uh-huh. And the next time
you want to disparage

15:11.670 --> 15:13.103
my ability to find
your supplies...
Fine.

15:13.140 --> 15:14.698
DAVI_S:_
You got my missmg case?

15:14.740 --> 15:16.947
I have no idea, but if
I do, I'll let you know.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.072
You can ask, uh,

15:18.110 --> 15:20.078
Betsy Ross over there.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.212
Hey, Betsy!
DAVIS: Wow.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.581
That's a new look for you.

15:23.620 --> 15:26.214
Never trust a sniper
who can't sew.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.285
Noted.

15:27.320 --> 15:27.786
Hey, you got a case
that doesn't belong to you?

15:27.820 --> 15:29.685
Uh, no. No, sorry.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.120
Hey, Davis.

15:32.160 --> 15:35.197
Do you know, uh, you know
whose bed I'm sleeping in?

15:35.230 --> 15:36.993
Yours.

15:37.030 --> 15:39.021
No, I mean, who from Echo
had

15:39.070 --> 15:41.231
He, uh...

15:41.270 --> 15:43.966
he left this behind.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.329
Looks like a talisman.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.207
BROCK:
Hey, I found it.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.003
DAVIS:
Oh, good.
Was it milk bones?

15:51.050 --> 15:52.472
Yeah, not quite.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.547
The new dog camera
and voice transmitter.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.569
Doubles the range
of the old one.

15:56.620 --> 15:57.689
Oh, cool.
It's pretty cool.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.017
SONNY:
Oh, yeah? Let me see that.

16:06.060 --> 16:09.598
Nobody likes Jalalabad air
that much.

16:09.630 --> 16:12.224
I'm Paul Mulwray.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.262
Okay.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.767
You DIA?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.006
I'm sorry?

16:18.040 --> 16:20.702
Or CIA

16:20.740 --> 16:22.469
I got a list of acronyms.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.740
I'm sorry. I don't
acronym with strangers.

16:24.780 --> 16:28.079
Sorry. I'm with Vice.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.111
Okay, Don Johnson.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.788
Do you work inside?

16:31.820 --> 16:35.187
This building? Sometimes.

16:35.220 --> 16:39.088
No notebook,
no files, no ID tag.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.722
No dog tags.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.297
So your outfit says
intelligence agency,

16:43.330 --> 16:44.729
but the haircut says...

16:44.770 --> 16:46.624
My haircut talks?

16:46.670 --> 16:48.137
No. Just trying
to get you

16:48.170 --> 16:50.138
to reveal something
about yourself.

16:50.170 --> 16:53.139
'Cause that's how you charmed
those MS

16:53.180 --> 16:55.034
You know who I am?

16:55.080 --> 16:58.174
I know you wrote a whole
piece about a murderous gang

16:58.210 --> 17:00.576
and then declined to turn
over relevant information

17:00.620 --> 17:02.178
to the DEA when they asked.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.108
I don't work
for the DEA.

17:04.150 --> 17:07.187
But you know who I am
and what I wrote.

17:07.220 --> 17:08.448
You ready?

17:08.490 --> 17:11.459
Absolutely.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.094
ERIC:
All right, gentlemen,
before Ms. Ellis

17:16.130 --> 17:19.099
briefs us on this evening's
target package,

17:19.130 --> 17:20.438
we're gonna meet our CST.

17:20.470 --> 17:21.391
égﬂiié
:7»: >v::::

17:21.440 --> 17:22.759
SONNY: Please remind me why
Tier One unit

17:22.800 --> 17:24.461
is no longer exempt

17:24.510 --> 17:26.307
from a cultural support
team program.

17:26.340 --> 17:28.137
ERIC:
'Cause Command says so.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.148
'Cause Command says so. Why not?
Why can't we waive this?

17:30.180 --> 17:32.603
It's a compromise we made
with the local tribal leaders.

17:32.650 --> 17:33.719
What if we go above
a certain altitude?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.069
Yeah, the thinner
the air gets,

17:35.120 --> 17:36.439
the less lift the helos
can generate,

17:36.480 --> 17:37.583
the less payload they can carry,

17:37.620 --> 17:39.144
the more it costs us
to bring a strap.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.384
I am not gonna lose
one of my shooters

17:40.420 --> 17:41.785
'cause of some cultural support.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.082
ERIC:
Yeah, I get it.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.483
The deal Command cuts

17:44.530 --> 17:45.849
says that we got to have
a woman along

17:45.890 --> 17:49.291
to handle any women
that might be on target.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.093
As you all know,
the Afghan males

17:51.130 --> 17:52.392
don't like you pawing
their wives.

17:52.430 --> 17:54.330
I don't paw.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.133
Davis.

18:01.540 --> 18:05.249
Staff Sergeant
Vanessa Ryan,

18:05.280 --> 18:08.078
meet Bravo Team.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.489
Ms. Ellis,

18:12.520 --> 18:14.351
would you please show us
who we're going after?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.882
Aresh Kamal, bomb maker.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.228
Forensic team thinks this is
the guy who built the device

18:22.260 --> 18:23.693
that killed Echo Team.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.309
MANDY:
As you can see from his history,

18:39.350 --> 18:40.374
Kamal moves around a lot.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.411
He always sets up his workshop
inside his house.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.589
FBI techs have identified

18:44.620 --> 18:48.158
the explosive that killed
Echo Team as a, uh,

18:48.190 --> 18:49.782
chloro-phosphorus compound.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.220
Basically, Kamal's version
of Armstrong's mixture.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.921
Bastard wanted as many people

18:53.960 --> 18:55.552
in the house as possible
before it blew.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.227
CLAY:
All right, so we
know he's in there,

18:57.270 --> 18:58.191
so why not-- why
not a drone hit?

18:58.230 --> 19:00.892
We need to talk to this S.O.B.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.635
MANDY:
Kamal's strictly mercenary.

19:02.670 --> 19:04.467
That means somebody backed up
the truck big time

19:04.510 --> 19:07.479
for the Echo job, and we want
to find out who that is.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.478
All right, look. Looks pretty
easy to lock down the street.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.239
Yeah. Perimeter's simple.
It looks like the houses

19:11.280 --> 19:13.419
on both sides--
they appear empty, so...

19:13.450 --> 19:14.747
SONNY:
Okay.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.941
We set our primary breach here.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.641
Secondary here.

19:18.690 --> 19:20.817
We bust in, we pull
that son of a bitch out

19:20.860 --> 19:22.179
by his small hairs.

19:22.220 --> 19:24.859
Easy-peasy.
Easy

19:24.890 --> 19:28.189
Yeah. I bet you he has
his house all rigged up, too.

19:28.230 --> 19:30.266
That's not
so easy-peasy.
Yeah.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.562
The guy does make
bombs for a living.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.330
How about a callout?
I was thinking that.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.292
Answer's gonna be
awful rislq, brother.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.705
Okay, here's what we do. We're
gonna secure the perimeter

19:37.740 --> 19:39.537
and do the callout. If he
doesn't come to us, then,

19:39.570 --> 19:41.299
Sonny, you're just gonna throw
some nine-bangers in the window.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.876
See if he comes out. Right?

19:42.910 --> 19:44.138
That doesn't happen, then
we'll follow up with the dog.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.899
Brock, make sure you have that
fancy new camera ready to go.

19:46.950 --> 19:48.713
We got to know what we're
heading into, right?

19:48.750 --> 19:51.548
We know this is our guy.
Let's do it.
Yeah.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.319
ERIC:
Yeah?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.281
Good call.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.961
Stalking isn't attractive.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.934
Good to know.

20:08.970 --> 20:12.235
Are you gonna
be a nuisance?

20:12.270 --> 20:14.409
Never. I was raised
better than that.

20:14.440 --> 20:18.570
Good to know the congressman
doesn't raise wildings.

20:18.610 --> 20:20.475
You didn't mention my father
in our last conversation.

20:20.520 --> 20:24.616
Hoped that meant you
hadn't put it together.

20:24.650 --> 20:25.912
Ijust...

20:25.950 --> 20:28.259
I would like access
to your operators.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.655
They're not my operators.

20:29.690 --> 20:31.248
Aanay, Tier One units

20:31.290 --> 20:33.326
don't allow embedded
journalists.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.918
Well, I'm not talking
about an embed,

20:34.960 --> 20:36.621
although I wouldn't say no.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.969
I just would like their
perspective on the mission here.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.298
Their perspective's
pretty narrow.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.489
I was pretty friendly

20:42.540 --> 20:44.735
with Steve Porter,
the Echo Team leader.

20:44.770 --> 20:47.773
We would talk from time to
time... deep background.

20:47.810 --> 20:50.847
Look, I don't make the rules,
so you're gonna have to get

20:50.880 --> 20:53.348
your Sebastian Junger on
some other way.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.317
Anything else?

20:56.350 --> 20:59.012
Nope. You can go.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.890
Check him.

21:08.930 --> 21:10.989
Oh!
Where'd you learn
how to shoot?

21:12.930 --> 21:14.932
Hey, you need anything?

21:14.970 --> 21:16.392
More ammo, maybe?

21:16.440 --> 21:17.600
No, I don't want to tempt fate.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.039
IfI end up
having to shoot it all,

21:19.070 --> 21:20.731
it means something
went real wrong.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.429
Name's Vanessa, by the way.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.345
Davis, officially.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.677
You got a first name?

21:25.710 --> 21:27.416
Doesn't everybody?

21:27.450 --> 21:28.917
We're gonna be bunkmates
for the next three months.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.781
You don't want to tell me
your first name?

21:30.820 --> 21:33.584
Maybe when we know each
other a little bit better.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.087
Is there anything
I need to know?

21:35.120 --> 21:36.712
About your guys?

21:36.760 --> 21:39.081
You do your job,
they'll respect you.

21:39.130 --> 21:40.358
You don't...

21:40.400 --> 21:42.391
Fair enough.

21:42.430 --> 21:43.522
Anything I need to know?

21:43.570 --> 21:46.528
Male-to-fem_ale ratio
on the main base

21:46.570 --> 21:48.390
is about ten to one,
so watch your back.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.395
Or enjoy it.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.061
You need anything,
you let me know.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.011
Good boy.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.122
Come on, Cerberus.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.549
SONNY:
Hey, don't say no

22:13.600 --> 22:15.056
to the Creature.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.527
Whoa.

22:18.570 --> 22:19.559
Wow.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.051
*

23:12.190 --> 23:14.385
*

23:43.050 --> 23:45.518
*

23:52.660 --> 23:53.957
Ray.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.696
TOC, this is Bravo 2.
You got eyes up?

23:56.730 --> 23:58.869
Roger, Bravo 2.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.128
ISR is on station.

24:00.170 --> 24:01.694
Going tight on target building.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.628
How was the wide view?
Anything moving?

24:03.670 --> 24:04.807
At the moment,
the only heat signatures

24:04.840 --> 24:05.966
I'm seeing are our guys.

24:06.010 --> 24:08.501
Any update on the target phone?

24:08.540 --> 24:09.700
Last ping

24:09.740 --> 24:11.571
put the phone in the house.

24:11.610 --> 24:13.612
Let's hope the bomb
maker's in there with it.

24:14.780 --> 24:16.577
Bravo 1, this is TOC.

24:16.620 --> 24:19.111
Your helos are up
and in their loiter pattern.

24:19.150 --> 24:20.879
_ You're cleared
to initiate your callout.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.512
Okay, you're up. Let's go, kid.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.926
Come on. Move. Hit 'em up.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.947
TOC, anything?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.017
There's no movement.

24:50.850 --> 24:52.647
Hit 'em up again.

25:04.700 --> 25:05.689
Okay.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.561
Here we go.

25:17.610 --> 25:19.544
Anybody see a vest?

25:19.580 --> 25:21.172
Tell her to hold.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.549
Tell her to hold.

25:43.140 --> 25:45.233
CLAY:
Hey, maybe she doesn't
speak any Pashto.

25:45.270 --> 25:46.760
I'll try Dari.

25:51.310 --> 25:52.902
Couple more steps,
I'm gonna drop her.

25:52.950 --> 25:54.144
Hold.

26:01.390 --> 26:02.709
Hold.

26:21.410 --> 26:23.605
Shine the light on me.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.089
Okay.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.767
I want you to tell her

26:50.810 --> 26:52.163
to lift her dress up

26:52.210 --> 26:54.735
so we know
that she is not armed.

27:06.820 --> 27:09.288
Brock, check her.
Rogen

27:10.460 --> 27:11.927
Check.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.154
We're good.

27:18.030 --> 27:21.966
Jalalabad has the only school
for the deaf in the area.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.331
You telling me the bomb maker's
got a deaf wife?

27:23.370 --> 27:25.304
That's ironic.
Maybe she's the only one

27:25.340 --> 27:26.762
who can stand being near him.

27:26.810 --> 27:28.277
She says her husband's not here.

27:28.310 --> 27:30.744
Out visiting his brother.
Left her home alone.
Oh, really?

27:30.780 --> 27:31.974
If she was alone, how'd she know
how to come outside?

27:32.010 --> 27:33.409
Yeah, not like she could
have heard the callout.
Know what?

27:33.450 --> 27:35.111
He's underneath the cot, hiding.

27:35.150 --> 27:36.845
Like a coward,
sent her out to face our guns.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.279
He's trying to lure us
in there like he did

27:38.320 --> 27:40.709
with Echo Team. Bring
the whole place down on us.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.682
You see any way we don't go
in there to get him out, boss?

27:44.730 --> 27:46.880
Send the dog.
See if the place is rigged.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.397
Brock, you ready?

27:48.430 --> 27:49.328
Yeah, we're good to go.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.964
Let's go.
VANESSA: How's he get inside?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.218
Doors closed. Windows closed.

27:53.270 --> 27:55.158
Just watch.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.409
JASON:
Send him.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.433
*

28:42.550 --> 28:44.518
Tell him to stop.
Sit.

28:44.550 --> 28:45.414
Sit.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.088
Look left.
Cerberus.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.758
Left.

28:48.790 --> 28:50.485
Now go right.
Cerberus,

28:50.520 --> 28:53.080
ﬁght

28:53.130 --> 28:55.018
Do you see that?
It's clear.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.823
We could surprise him
by breaching that wall.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.876
Hey, he's got something.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.515
Blade.

29:18.550 --> 29:19.778
Blade.
Let's go.

29:19.820 --> 29:22.380
Go, go, go, go.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.381
JASON:
TOC.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.297
The dog cleared us
all the way to Kamal.

29:31.830 --> 29:33.934
(Cerberus growling,
Kamal grunting)

30:06.630 --> 30:08.495
CLAY:
Get his armor off and check him.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.131
Come on.

30:17.180 --> 30:18.169
Oh, come here.

30:22.650 --> 30:25.847
We good?
Nothing. It's not his blood.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.539
Yeah, I think
it-it's Kamal's blood.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.019
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.220
We had to take out Kamal.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.609
Aren't you gonna
clean him off, Brock?

30:48.640 --> 30:50.198
Look at him. He looks proud.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.344
He is proud.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.348
Pashto sign language, huh?

30:54.380 --> 30:56.974
_ There is no Pashto
Sign language, not really.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.578
No?
Schools in Jalalabad

30:58.620 --> 31:00.611
teach the same ASL I learned
in the Girl Scouts.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.380
Yeah, well, you know what,
luclq for us--

31:03.420 --> 31:05.581
or for her, at least--
a hell of a call.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.552
Would have been a stupid one
if we got blown up.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.353
Glad we didn't get blown up,

31:09.400 --> 31:10.651
or we wouldn't be here, right?

31:10.700 --> 31:12.964
I wouldn't be giving you
such a hard time

31:13.000 --> 31:15.264
about Pashto sign language.

31:25.610 --> 31:28.113
*

31:36.060 --> 31:38.153
Sorry we couldn't get you
an HVT to question.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.680
My understanding, he was trying

31:39.730 --> 31:41.322
to stab one
of your team members.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.989
Well, he was also
reaching for a detonator.

31:45.030 --> 31:47.225
Sounds like he didn't
give you much choice.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.568
You guys pulled a lot
of intel out of that house.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.034
Hoping one of the cell phones
will give us a target.

31:52.070 --> 31:54.129
Something else I
want to run by you.
Okay, what's that?

31:54.180 --> 31:59.470
What if somebody blackmailed
Tariq into setting up our guys?

31:59.510 --> 32:01.171
His relationship with Azim

32:01.220 --> 32:03.017
would have made him
a prime target.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.484
Yeah, but why is he making
all those calls to the bad guys?

32:05.520 --> 32:07.147
What if he wasn't?

32:07.190 --> 32:09.488
All the calls pinged
off a single cell tower

32:09.520 --> 32:11.158
in the Gunara neighborhood.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.726
It's miles from where he lived.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.318
Maybe that's his tradecraft.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.157
Leaves home, make the calls.

32:16.200 --> 32:17.724
Maybe, or somebody
else made them.

32:17.760 --> 32:21.594
Tariq didn't show up on
a single one of our lists.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.733
And a gay real
estate developer

32:23.770 --> 32:26.159
who's just starting
to make a go of it?

32:26.210 --> 32:29.668
Doesn't match any terrorist
profile I've ever seen.

32:29.710 --> 32:31.177
Right, but who's gonna go
through all the trouble

32:31.210 --> 32:32.438
to set him up like that?

32:34.080 --> 32:36.071
Let's find out.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.481
Now you bring your thug
to beat me.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.054
You know, it's, uh... I...

32:46.090 --> 32:48.752
I believe
I owe you an apology, Azim.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.693
TRANSLATOR:
He says you think he's a fool.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.106
MANDY:
No, I don't.
In fact, I just

32:59.140 --> 33:01.233
finished reading through
your school records.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.577
It's very impressive,

33:02.610 --> 33:04.646
particularly your grades
in English.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.778
What do you want?

33:10.820 --> 33:14.051
_ You told me _
Tariq wasn't a terrorist.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.580
I didn't believe you.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.589
I'm ready
to believe you now.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.326
We need you to
help us understand

33:21.360 --> 33:24.124
why he did what he did,

33:24.170 --> 33:26.798
why he brought our men
to their deaths.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.993
I think someone was forcing him.

33:31.340 --> 33:35.379
We can protect you, Azim,
but only if you help us.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.611
Um, a few weeks ago,

33:47.650 --> 33:50.153
something changed in Tariq.

33:50.190 --> 33:54.559
He wasn't so
gentle anymore.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.525
At first, I thought
maybe it was his wife.

34:00.770 --> 34:04.331
The call he made to you
on the day that he died?

34:04.370 --> 34:07.407
He... he wanted to say good-bye.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.806
But not only that, right?

34:11.750 --> 34:13.604
He-he told me to run.

34:13.650 --> 34:15.242
Did he say why?

34:15.280 --> 34:17.578
Just to... just to get
out of the province.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.416
Out of the country
if I could.

34:18.450 --> 34:19.417
He tells you
to leave the country,

34:19.450 --> 34:21.589
and you don't know why?
He told me that I was

34:21.620 --> 34:23.212
in terrible danger,

34:23.260 --> 34:25.421
and I should go to
his fit house.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.087
"Fitna" house, like "disaster"?

34:27.130 --> 34:29.519
Yes, where
you found me.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.199
He had money hidden there,

34:32.230 --> 34:36.234
told me to use it
to buy a new life.

34:36.270 --> 34:38.409
MANDY:
Azim, I need you

34:38.440 --> 34:41.375
to try to remember
if he said anything else.

34:41.410 --> 34:45.301
Anything that might help us
find the people who did this.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.616
H-He said to forget about
the man with the red car.

34:52.650 --> 34:55.210
The man with the red car?

34:55.260 --> 34:58.286
He did business
with Tariq. I...

34:58.330 --> 35:00.286
I don't know
his name.
You worked for Tariq,

35:00.330 --> 35:02.355
and you're telling me
you can't remember the names

35:02.400 --> 35:03.697
of the people
he did business with?

35:03.730 --> 35:05.459
Is that what you're saying?

35:05.500 --> 35:07.798
I believe Tariq did not want
me to know this man's name.

35:07.830 --> 35:12.164
The only time I saw him, he...

35:12.210 --> 35:14.735
he came to see Tariq
at the apartment.

35:15.940 --> 35:18.773
He saw us...
together.

35:21.950 --> 35:24.248
Tariq was so angry.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.645
Do you remember
what they talked about?

35:26.690 --> 35:28.385
The man brought
him outside

35:28.420 --> 35:30.456
to talk in his car.

35:30.490 --> 35:31.457
The red car?

35:31.490 --> 35:34.425
A Mercedes.

35:45.370 --> 35:48.498
Trying to catch me
in all my resplendent glory?

35:48.540 --> 35:49.871
Don't flatter yourself.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.741
Uh, if you're not trying
to sneak a peek,

35:51.780 --> 35:52.906
what can I do for you?

35:52.950 --> 35:57.614
Who do you know around here
who drives a red Mercedes?

35:57.650 --> 36:00.687
Your experience, people ever
give away currency

36:00.720 --> 36:02.608
without expecting
something in return?

36:02.660 --> 36:04.651
No, I suppose it
depends on the person.

36:04.690 --> 36:07.420
Some guys, all you got to
do is make eyes at them,

36:07.460 --> 36:09.189
and they'll give you
everything they got.

36:09.230 --> 36:12.927
I'd say that depends more
on who's making the eyes.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.961
I'm serious.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.639
If you want me
giving you information,

36:17.670 --> 36:19.831
it's gonna have
to be a two-way street.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.428
Nothing for nothing?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.970
That's right.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.841
I'll tell you what.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.974
Any of this goes anywhere,
I'll give you as much as I can

36:28.010 --> 36:32.344
without violating my oath or
sending myself to prison. Deal?

36:34.020 --> 36:36.853
So you want to know
who drives the red Mercedes?

36:36.890 --> 36:39.222
The red Mercedes?
This isn't Dubai.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.989
All the time
I've spent in Afghanistan,

36:41.030 --> 36:43.999
bet I can count the number of
Mercedes I've seen on one hand.

36:44.030 --> 36:47.693
Fact, this part of the country,
I know of exactly... one.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.594
JASON:_
I am starVIng.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.770
What's that?
Oh.

36:54.810 --> 36:57.278
Steve got enough extra wood
and material to build a bar.

36:57.310 --> 36:59.699
Tiki bar, even though we told
him it was tacky as hell.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.241
All right, let's get Echo
Team's bar up and going.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.316
RAY: _
Guy was trying
to make dovetail joints.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.784
Bag of tools, buddy.
You got a bag of tools?

37:08.820 --> 37:10.287
Hey, can I,
can I ask you something?

37:10.320 --> 37:11.821
I'm not a bartender.

37:11.860 --> 37:15.296
That's not what
I was gonna ask you.

37:15.330 --> 37:17.958
I, uh... found this.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.961
Damn it.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.968
Ramon.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.309
It's Ramon's.
Echo's breacher?

37:25.340 --> 37:29.606
Yeah. Ramon was in Iraq
when a guy got the jump on him.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.575
Gun an inch from his head,
to hear Ramon tell it.

37:32.610 --> 37:35.317
Course, the first time, it
was four inches, but you know.

37:35.350 --> 37:37.910
The guy pulled the trigger,
but the bullet didn't fire.

37:37.950 --> 37:40.987
Ramon smoked him, took the
dead bullet out of the gun.

37:41.020 --> 37:43.011
Primer was a dud.

37:43.060 --> 37:46.325
Hmm. One in a million.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.397
Yeah. Sometimes luck happens.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.824
I got something
for this. Hold on.

37:53.870 --> 37:55.292
Nice.

38:01.910 --> 38:03.878
Want to talk about it?

38:03.910 --> 38:05.946
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
Why don't we get yourself

38:05.980 --> 38:08.414
a white wine spritzer and
we'll go for a long walk?

38:09.950 --> 38:13.340
Yeah, I seen that look
in your eyes before.

38:13.390 --> 38:15.381
Know what it means.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.881
You got
to give her time, Jace.

38:20.930 --> 38:23.899
Time_'s not on
my Side, Ray.

38:23.930 --> 38:26.421
She's not gonna give
me any more time.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.064
Not possible.

38:29.100 --> 38:32.103
You know, I left her
a long time ago.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.404
I think she realized
I'm never coming back.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.948
SONNY:
One, two, three, go.

38:38.980 --> 38:41.107
I'm good, man. One
shift at a time, right?

38:41.150 --> 38:42.174
Yeah, yeah, man,
you know...

38:42.220 --> 38:44.347
We'll get the top of this
thing going here, huh?

38:44.390 --> 38:45.709
Yeah, let's do it.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.115
I got it. Hey.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.788
You got it?
Here we go.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.412
One, two, three.
Yeah, one, two, three.
There we go.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.451
There you go.
Clay,

38:52.490 --> 38:53.457
come help an
old man out.

38:53.490 --> 38:54.627
CLAY:
You got this.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.028
Keep running into you.

39:02.070 --> 39:03.890
Guess so.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.430
Well, there's not enough women

39:05.470 --> 39:06.801
to warrant
a second quarters, so...

39:06.840 --> 39:09.400
It's not always
gonna be that way.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.878
Hey, it was good seeing you
out there... with the team.

39:13.910 --> 39:16.970
I would've liked to go in
and help schwack the guy.

39:17.020 --> 39:19.443
There'll be lots of guys.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.082
You keep vampire hours, too?

39:21.120 --> 39:23.816
Split. Got to be back
in TOC later tonight.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.384
Listen, we're just outside

39:25.430 --> 39:27.557
fixing up a bar Echo was
building if you want to help.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.126
Just came to get these.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.390
Sounds good.

39:31.430 --> 39:34.888
Listen, if you ever want
to talk about CST training...

39:34.940 --> 39:38.034
Oh, I... I got a plan.

39:38.070 --> 39:41.062
I know.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.879
Think we did this
instead of a fire pit, right?

39:55.920 --> 39:59.026
You think the fixings for pia
coladas are hidden somewhere?
DAVIS: This was the best

39:59.060 --> 40:01.187
I could do._
You rum-running
already?

40:01.230 --> 40:02.857
That's one thing
about letting

40:02.900 --> 40:04.094
those hipsters
into the Air Force.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.893
They know how to
make some beer.

40:05.930 --> 40:08.091
I swear they got a better
setup than a microbrewery.

40:08.130 --> 40:10.530
No, that's too hoppy
for me. I'll take this.

40:13.470 --> 40:15.438
To Echo.

40:50.540 --> 40:52.644
You rang?

40:52.680 --> 40:54.511
Salim Hakan.

40:54.550 --> 40:55.574
Salim Hakan?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.247
Commander of
the Afghan

40:57.280 --> 40:59.145
_ National Police
in this entire provmce

40:59.190 --> 41:01.078
and also widely
considered to be

41:01.120 --> 41:03.657
a potential candidate
for high elected office.

41:03.690 --> 41:06.227
Well, that's nice
for him and all,

41:06.260 --> 41:08.626
but what does that have
to do with anything?

41:10.260 --> 41:12.694
I think
he's the man in the red car,

41:12.730 --> 41:17.633
the one Azim mentioned, who
Tariq told him to forget.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.238
I can tell you want that
to mean something.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.999
I'm starting to think it means

41:25.050 --> 41:28.008
Salim is the guy
who blackmailed Tariq

41:28.050 --> 41:29.847
into luring Echo Team
to their deaths.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.087
Look, if you want to go after
a national police commander,

41:32.120 --> 41:33.519
you're gonna need
a lot more information

41:33.550 --> 41:35.518
than what you have
right there.
I know.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.084
I'm thinking
maybe this, uh,

41:37.120 --> 41:39.623
reporter guy friend of yours

41:39.660 --> 41:42.049
is the one that's probably
feeding in your ear

41:42.100 --> 41:44.091
that Salim was the one
in the red car?

41:44.130 --> 41:46.598
You got to be careful
with a guy like that,

41:46.630 --> 41:47.597
especially reporters,
I'm telling you.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.030
You're not telling me
how to run my assets?

41:50.070 --> 41:51.731
Is that what he is right now,
an asset?

41:51.770 --> 41:54.102
I don't want to talk about him.

41:54.140 --> 41:57.177
I want you to help me figure out
if this high-level official

41:57.210 --> 41:59.303
arranged the murder
of six of our guys.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.671
Okay, do you have any idea
how you would like

42:01.720 --> 42:03.176
to go about doing
something like that?

42:03.220 --> 42:05.040
Carefully.
