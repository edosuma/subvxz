WEBVTT

00:48.958 --> 00:52.083
-You! What are you?

00:52.666 --> 00:55.250
I'm…

01:13.708 --> 01:17.458
Thank you so much!
We are your band, Star Waver!

01:17.541 --> 01:20.458
On flaming rumble bass, Gee!

01:21.708 --> 01:25.250
On the versatile cluster drums, Lan!

01:26.958 --> 01:30.250
On the electrified dual guitars, Kurti!

01:31.291 --> 01:32.958
And on vocals, it's me--

01:35.041 --> 01:37.500
-Oh, sorry. Sorry 'bout that, folks.

01:38.208 --> 01:40.666
-And rocking those electronic sounds…
-Hey, who are they?

01:40.750 --> 01:41.875
…it's V-5!

01:41.958 --> 01:43.541
And on vocals, it's me--

01:46.541 --> 01:47.791
Uh, hey, guys.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.958
We're sorta playing a gig here.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.083
I have business with this slug.

01:54.708 --> 01:57.166
Come along. Jabba's been looking for you.

01:57.833 --> 02:01.000
If you resist,
we'll disintegrate your friends.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.750
Tell me, does Jabba want my autograph?

02:09.833 --> 02:11.500
Let's rock 'em!

02:40.625 --> 02:41.833
Move out!

02:44.125 --> 02:45.625
Ha!

03:03.625 --> 03:05.291
This is the third time now.

03:05.375 --> 03:08.541
-Such passionate fans we have.
-Yep. That's just the price of fame.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.291
-Hey!

03:11.500 --> 03:14.041
I know. We never finish the set.

03:14.125 --> 03:15.791
Well, we live to play another day.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.958
Yeah, I suppose you'd rather die
for your art.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.041
Guys, enough.

03:19.125 --> 03:22.541
It just--
Be nice to finish a show for once.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.041
We've been followed!

03:28.125 --> 03:29.500
Persistent, isn't he?

03:29.583 --> 03:31.041
Okay, punch it!

03:31.125 --> 03:32.708
I've punched it already!

03:38.291 --> 03:39.291
Shut up!

03:47.875 --> 03:49.416
I got a bad feeling about this.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.083
You're marked for execution, Hutt.

04:14.166 --> 04:17.291
It's pointless to resist, but I can wait.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.166
I don't even know what I did.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.291
You know.

04:21.375 --> 04:23.083
I don't care about Hutt legacy.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.208
I won't join Jabba.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.166
Being a part of that syndicate is boring.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.666
We're going to be part
of a legendary band!

04:28.750 --> 04:29.916
Jabba is not to be crossed.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.416
What? No, wait!

04:33.916 --> 04:34.916
Okay.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.166
Stop!

04:43.750 --> 04:45.916
You really want to do this?

04:49.750 --> 04:51.375
What? No…

05:24.750 --> 05:26.791
-Huh?
-Come on. Get up and help, Jay.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.416
You know how to fix things too.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.416
Yeah, but Gee…

05:32.125 --> 05:33.791
There's nothing
we could have done.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.833
Perhaps we were just lucky
and our luck ran out.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.666
Ultimately, we are just a band.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.791
I know that!

05:41.875 --> 05:45.541
I know that. But I can't just abandon him.

05:45.625 --> 05:47.750
After all we've been through…

05:50.583 --> 05:53.458
You… What are you?

05:56.125 --> 05:57.625
I'm…

05:59.083 --> 06:00.291
Huh?

06:10.666 --> 06:13.541
Testing, testing,
one, two, three, sibilance.

06:13.625 --> 06:16.625
We should commemorate
the first session of Star Waver.

06:16.708 --> 06:19.041
-Jay! Kurti! Lan!

06:19.125 --> 06:22.500
Yeah, and you too, V-5.
I'd never forget you.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.416
I've finally got the band members
I was looking for.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.291
Our legend starts here!

06:27.833 --> 06:30.041
All right, all right,
let's get on with it, Gee.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.000
Okay, yeah. Fine, fine, yeah.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.916
Lan, count it off!

06:34.583 --> 06:36.791
One, two! One, two, three, four!

06:40.375 --> 06:44.083
The first time we played together.
We had a lot of fun that day.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.166
We did.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.041
Jay?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.125
You were right, Kurti.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.958
In the end, we're just a band.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.791
We're just a band.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.208
Huh? What-- What--

07:36.291 --> 07:37.375
Hey, Gee.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.583
Wh-- You guys, what are you doing here?

07:39.666 --> 07:43.833
We made a deal with Jabba
to let us perform before he executes you.

07:43.916 --> 07:47.083
We only get one song though, so…

07:47.166 --> 07:50.208
Have you lost your minds?
You don't need to get caught up in this.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.083
You should go. You guys are just…

07:53.166 --> 07:55.500
You're not one to run away
from your fans, are you?

07:55.583 --> 07:58.416
This'll be our biggest venue
since we formed the band, Gee!

07:59.833 --> 08:01.583
Let's make this our best show ever.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.833
Let's rock!

08:27.541 --> 08:29.375
-Huh?

08:30.041 --> 08:32.750
-Calm down. It's just a mic.

08:35.625 --> 08:39.458
One, two! One, two, three, four!

10:52.291 --> 10:53.916
-Huh?
-Hey, Jabba!

10:54.708 --> 10:56.208
We'll give you a chance!

10:56.833 --> 10:59.833
We're going to be the number one band
in the galaxy.

10:59.916 --> 11:01.166
Hmm.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.666
So then, how do you feel
about becoming our first sponsor?

11:10.500 --> 11:14.208
One more song! One more song!
One more song!

11:14.291 --> 11:15.916
-One more!
-Come on!

11:16.000 --> 11:18.250
-One more!

11:19.833 --> 11:21.916
-Come on, Jabba!
-Let them sing!

11:35.250 --> 11:37.666
Yeah! They did it!

12:15.833 --> 12:18.333
-Okay then, you ready for one more?
-Yeah!

12:18.416 --> 12:20.250
This one's for the band!
