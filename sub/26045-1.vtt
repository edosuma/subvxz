No identification with actuall persons, companies,
and organizations is intended or should be inferred.

00:40.620 --> 00:41.940
Finally, the 4th floor.

00:42.650 --> 00:44.040
I'm freaking nervous!

00:44.330 --> 00:46.710
What the hell! So scared.

00:48.350 --> 00:49.350
That's scary...

00:50.570 --> 00:52.740
Damn it! Don't play around!

00:52.860 --> 00:53.860
You little chicken.

00:57.540 --> 00:58.620
Isn't this it? 402?

00:59.860 --> 01:01.030
It really exists.

01:03.260 --> 01:04.580
This shit is heavy.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.486
Hey, Hae-chan.
You said we wouldn't come.

01:06.510 --> 01:09.130
But we're right in front of room 402.

01:09.430 --> 01:10.330
You see? 402!

01:10.360 --> 01:13.180
We're not chicken like you.
We're real men!

01:13.220 --> 01:15.570
Now we'll unlock it and leave.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.970
You thought we cannot make it.
But we made it!

01:18.160 --> 01:19.320
We're real men, you sucker!

01:19.330 --> 01:21.180
We're opening the door!
Hold this for me.

01:22.730 --> 01:23.890
We're doing it for real!

01:25.500 --> 01:28.900
But it doesn't go through.

01:29.730 --> 01:30.730
Stop acting!

01:31.040 --> 01:32.740
It's not opening. I don't know how...

01:33.270 --> 01:34.310
Total wuss.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.020
- What was that?
- What?

01:47.350 --> 01:48.350
Wait.

02:01.730 --> 02:05.470
Hello, everyone. You must've
seen this on Youtube.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.970
The high schoolers who
went missing at Gonjiam.

02:08.270 --> 02:10.039
So what should I do?

02:10.240 --> 02:12.280
I checked whether the
clip was fabricated.

02:12.410 --> 02:13.410
Ta-da!

02:13.580 --> 02:17.480
<i>Teenage boys went missing
on their horror experience.</i>

02:19.220 --> 02:20.480
That's real.

02:20.650 --> 02:23.120
And the ghost picture
doesn't seem fake.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.050
So!

02:24.120 --> 02:28.030
Our next stop for Horror Times'
3rd horror experience squad is

02:28.230 --> 02:31.030
one of three most
haunted houses in Korea

02:31.060 --> 02:34.399
and one of 7 freakiest places on earth!

02:34.400 --> 02:36.300
Namyoung Psychiatric Hospital.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.769
Since it opened in May 1961, it was
the best mental hospital in Korea

02:41.770 --> 02:46.740
but it closed in October 1979
after a mass suicide of patients

02:46.750 --> 02:49.309
and the disappearance of its director.

02:49.310 --> 02:52.020
The building still stands,
yet abandoned.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.220
Gonjiam asylum, folks!

02:55.220 --> 02:56.120
Footages!

02:56.121 --> 02:58.290
<i>No. 1026.</i>

02:59.220 --> 03:03.830
<i>The 11th 5.16 citizens award
ceremony was held at the Blue House.</i>

03:04.330 --> 03:08.329
<i>The grand prize goes to Park Young-ae</i>

03:08.330 --> 03:11.569
<i>the director of Namyoung
Psychiatric Hospital</i>

03:11.570 --> 03:16.409
<i>recognizing her achievement for
treating not only mental patients,</i>

03:16.410 --> 03:19.910
<i>but also political prisoners
and brutal criminals.</i>

03:20.150 --> 03:23.910
There are numerous rumors
around Gonjiam asylum.

03:23.950 --> 03:27.349
Some say it was built on the place
where the Japanese brutally murdered

03:27.350 --> 03:29.549
and buried the Korean resistance

03:29.550 --> 03:33.460
so that nobody could trace the bodies.

03:33.530 --> 03:39.329
Or it was the national torturing facility
in the 60s and 70s disguised as asylum

03:39.330 --> 03:42.569
or that the mass suicide was
actually murdered by the director

03:42.570 --> 03:45.870
who then killed herself,
not went missing.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.309
So there are countless reports
of ghost sightings

03:49.310 --> 03:52.239
and hearings of wailing after
the closure of the asylum.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.849
The biggest rumor among
all is about room 402,

03:54.850 --> 03:57.250
the only locked space of the asylum.

03:57.420 --> 04:00.480
They say whoever dares to open
that room is cursed to death.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.650
So we are going to
the Gonjiam asylum,

04:03.660 --> 04:09.489
on October 26th the day it
closed, to investigate the truth

04:09.490 --> 04:15.600
about supernatural phenomena
and the ghosts many people witnessed.

04:16.070 --> 04:17.269
Care to join?

04:22.910 --> 04:25.980
I'm at the terrace of
a cafe at Gangnam.

04:27.110 --> 04:30.580
Guess I'm the first one.
Let me wait for others to come.

04:32.950 --> 04:35.050
- For Horror Times?
- Yes.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.320
- Hello.
- Hi.

04:36.990 --> 04:38.820
- Are you filming me?
- Yes.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.559
Yes, my family is in the States

04:41.560 --> 04:43.390
and I'm here with my dance crew.

04:44.230 --> 04:45.559
- Wow.
- Awesome.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.000
- What do you do?
- Studying nursing...

04:48.170 --> 04:50.800
- Boys must like you!
- I'm at a women's univ.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.400
Isn't he the one?

04:53.740 --> 04:55.140
Here they are!

04:58.340 --> 04:59.340
Hello everyone.

04:59.410 --> 05:00.280
Hello.

05:00.281 --> 05:02.350
- Nice to see you.
- Hello.

05:04.620 --> 05:06.149
Let's do some introduction.

05:06.150 --> 05:07.150
Sure!

05:07.650 --> 05:09.790
These are the selected applicants:

05:10.120 --> 05:12.290
Oh Ah-yeon, Park Ji-hyun, and...

05:12.360 --> 05:14.730
- Charlotte!
- Charlotte Moon.

05:14.930 --> 05:17.060
And from Horror Times,

05:17.100 --> 05:18.730
Lee Seung-wook, Park Sung-hun.

05:18.760 --> 05:19.660
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:19.730 --> 05:20.999
Seung-wook will do MC

05:21.000 --> 05:23.270
and Sung-hun will
operate the 1st camera.

05:23.570 --> 05:25.940
And you know who I am?
Ha-joon, the captain of the squad.

05:29.070 --> 05:31.480
- It's like a group date.
- Right.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.610
- Didn't mean it...
- Just stop talking.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.949
Seems like one is missing.

05:36.950 --> 05:38.720
- As if you saw a ghost...
- Isn't he?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.820
I guess so.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.850
- Shall we call him?
- Here!

05:45.520 --> 05:47.360
- Here!
- Come here!

05:47.390 --> 05:48.890
Yes, please come here!

05:49.330 --> 05:50.390
Here he comes!

05:51.860 --> 05:54.669
Hello, you're here for Horror Times?

05:54.670 --> 05:57.900
- Hello!
- Sorry, I was lost nearby.

05:58.070 --> 06:00.300
Je-yoon will do editing
and graphic effects.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.739
Ji-hyun, 2nd camera.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.740
And one go pro camera per two.

06:03.980 --> 06:07.440
Please memorize the floor
plan and the cue-sheet.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.250
What are you doing?

06:10.250 --> 06:12.120
It's for the fuck-you-mentary.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.230
- Cheers!
- Bottoms up!

06:22.430 --> 06:24.030
- Nice to meet you!
- Cheers!

06:24.060 --> 06:26.599
Where have you been to among
CNN's 7 freakiest places?

06:26.600 --> 06:29.730
Sedlec Ossuary in Czech, the
Island of the Dolls in Mexico,

06:29.930 --> 06:32.139
and Aokigahara Forest in Japan.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.140
I've been to three places.

06:33.141 --> 06:36.739
Everyone who's seen
the ghost at Gonjiam

06:36.740 --> 06:38.310
heard some sound first.

06:38.340 --> 06:40.810
- You mean a ping-pong ball?
- You're right.

06:41.420 --> 06:43.920
People who saw the ghosts
there heard a ping-pong ball.

06:44.130 --> 06:46.160
But why that specific sound?

06:46.530 --> 06:50.530
Actually there is a ping pong table.
Broken in half.

06:50.770 --> 06:54.830
Can't it be the echoed
sound of water drops?

06:54.900 --> 06:58.839
But why did the director
kill all her patients?

06:58.840 --> 07:00.470
There's no proof she killed them.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.880
People say that as all
the patients died

07:02.940 --> 07:04.280
and the director went missing.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.280
Rumor also says she hung herself
at the hospital's bathroom.

07:08.380 --> 07:12.390
Her neck apparently was
stretched a foot long.

07:12.450 --> 07:13.890
Gross...

07:14.560 --> 07:15.790
Are you scared?

07:17.430 --> 07:18.430
Me?

07:20.330 --> 07:21.330
No.

07:21.331 --> 07:22.930
- You seem to be.
- No way!

07:24.030 --> 07:26.629
Whose idea is it to air this live?

07:26.630 --> 07:30.139
A car racing club uploaded

07:30.140 --> 07:34.539
the clip of their wild speed racing
on their website a while ago.

07:34.540 --> 07:38.679
It reached 200K views and
earned more than 100K for ads.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.110
- 100K dollars?
- Yes.

07:40.450 --> 07:42.850
Can you earn money
airing this kind of stuff?

07:43.380 --> 07:44.550
Hell yes...

07:44.820 --> 07:48.959
I guess you are a kind of student

07:48.960 --> 07:51.590
who learns everything by the book.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.129
Never breaks rules.

07:53.130 --> 07:55.459
- She's cute.
- Yes, very cute but...

07:55.460 --> 07:57.259
- learning everything by the book.
- Stop it.

07:57.260 --> 07:59.030
Not by experiences...

07:59.470 --> 08:01.230
How many views are you expecting?

08:01.800 --> 08:03.870
- A million!
- A million?

08:04.340 --> 08:06.539
I am aiming for that.

08:06.540 --> 08:08.310
- Heavy.
- Do you mean a million?

08:08.340 --> 08:11.610
It means well earn $500K
as it's 5 times of 200K views?

08:12.050 --> 08:13.180
Captain.

08:14.180 --> 08:16.550
I really think we
should send her home.

08:18.950 --> 08:20.120
Why?

08:21.120 --> 08:23.320
- Ready?
- Sure.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.589
- Wow!
- Oh my god!

08:26.590 --> 08:27.659
- Did he catch it?
- I can't believe it!

08:27.660 --> 08:29.100
He caught it!

08:30.930 --> 08:32.299
Unbelievable!

08:35.240 --> 08:37.299
- He got it! Right?
- Let me see!

08:37.640 --> 08:38.640
Impossible!

08:40.809 --> 08:41.809
How you do that?

08:44.880 --> 08:45.880
Hurry!

08:48.120 --> 08:49.280
Just throw it!

08:49.380 --> 08:50.380
Shoot it!

08:51.320 --> 08:52.320
Hey!

08:53.420 --> 08:55.620
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.620
I think we really should
send her home.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.160
- You come here.
- Please...

08:59.330 --> 09:02.460
- For million views!
- Million views!

09:02.530 --> 09:03.800
Cheers!

09:11.540 --> 09:13.310
No one saw the director ghost.

09:13.370 --> 09:16.579
Don't you think her spirit
should be there, too?

09:16.580 --> 09:17.440
You're right.

09:17.450 --> 09:20.450
But people only saw the patients
and a high school girl.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.090
Patients I get it. But
why a high school girl?

09:25.120 --> 09:26.920
About 30 years ago?

09:27.120 --> 09:30.159
Three high school girls went
there to test their nerves

09:30.160 --> 09:33.660
and were found unconscious
while trying to open room 402.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.799
They were immediately
sent to the hospital.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.169
Two of them went insane
and jumped to their deaths.

09:40.170 --> 09:43.869
The other one remained unconscious.
That's what I heard.

09:43.870 --> 09:47.870
That's why there's a rumor
that the room 402 is cursed.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.109
What's our plan for room 402 then?

09:50.110 --> 09:53.750
The climax of this experience
will be opening the door.

09:54.450 --> 09:55.580
Wow!

09:55.950 --> 09:58.420
- You never mentioned that.
- Great!

09:59.700 --> 10:00.969
It's more fun to know by surprise.

10:00.970 --> 10:03.540
We're opening it! Yeah!

10:04.210 --> 10:06.840
- Not all of us are coming in?
- Why?

10:07.750 --> 10:09.080
Are you scared?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.110
Hell, no!

10:11.450 --> 10:14.020
You're really good at joking.

10:14.250 --> 10:17.620
Seriously,
who is opening that door?

10:24.700 --> 10:25.830
Go, go, go!

10:29.400 --> 10:31.200
- No!
- Pass me, please!

10:31.400 --> 10:33.700
No, hell no!

10:33.970 --> 10:36.270
You ve got it!

10:37.240 --> 10:39.079
Wait, wait.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.509
- Go Je-yoon, go Je-yoon!
- I can't accept it.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.309
- Someone manipulated it.
- What is he saying?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.979
Horror Times don't do such thing!

10:44.980 --> 10:46.480
Something's wrong with it.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.190
Are you scared?
I can go with you.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.050
You take care of yourself.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.360
Why is he shaking?

10:59.100 --> 11:00.330
He's relieved.

11:01.430 --> 11:02.700
He saw us!

11:04.940 --> 11:05.940
Wait for me!

11:06.350 --> 11:07.550
Wait for me!

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
Wait!

11:12.890 --> 11:13.960
Let's go now.

11:15.160 --> 11:15.960
Impressive.

11:15.961 --> 11:17.600
- Can that follow us?
- Of course!

11:25.080 --> 11:27.079
We can't get in anyway
if we get there early.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.750
Let's have some fun.

11:30.290 --> 11:34.789
You mean going for a dip like
previous horror experience?

11:34.790 --> 11:36.260
It's almost November.

12:07.290 --> 12:10.790
<i>You've reached the destination.</i>

12:10.930 --> 12:12.130
There.

12:12.260 --> 12:14.160
That's the entrance all barricaded.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.239
They blocked it!

12:20.240 --> 12:23.010
- We can't get in through here.
- Then how can we go through?

12:23.040 --> 12:25.039
We'll get in from the back.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.040
Police patrol here even at night.

12:27.140 --> 12:29.050
- Really?
- Yes.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.120
Look at that.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.150
This car can get in?

12:42.060 --> 12:43.260
It's heavy.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.030
It's scary here.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.870
- We're here.
- Let's get out.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.530
Finally!

12:53.370 --> 12:55.340
- It must be heavy.
- You're not helping?

13:02.780 --> 13:05.110
Hey, look at the camera.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.750
This way.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.320
We are going all the way
to the top?

13:11.390 --> 13:12.320
Yes.

13:12.321 --> 13:15.320
The hospital is right in front of us.
Why should we climb this hill?

13:15.330 --> 13:16.789
There are surveillance cameras.

13:16.790 --> 13:17.960
I have ta headache.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.360
- Can't you see these?
- Why you wearing heels?

13:24.840 --> 13:26.499
Hey, hurry up!

13:26.500 --> 13:27.670
Je-yoon!

13:28.540 --> 13:29.840
Are you okay?

13:30.070 --> 13:33.140
Is this a horror club

13:34.310 --> 13:36.080
or an extreme sports club?

13:36.910 --> 13:40.050
A drone camera is
following us from above.

13:41.850 --> 13:42.850
Hello!

13:44.290 --> 13:45.320
Let's go.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.660
Do it properly!

14:00.170 --> 14:01.670
- Help me with this.
- What?

14:11.550 --> 14:12.880
So cozy.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.630
It is 9:25 PM.

14:26.100 --> 14:30.269
Sung-hun and Seung-wook
are out to Gonjiam Asylum

14:30.270 --> 14:32.340
for installing CCTV inside.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.540
Wish they wouldn't encounter
the ghosts too early.

14:39.010 --> 14:40.510
We have ghosts here too.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.610
My hat!

14:43.910 --> 14:45.550
The camera is on.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.750
O.K, they're inside.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.060
<i>Seung-wook that's good.</i>

14:56.160 --> 14:59.159
<i>Okay with angles and positions.</i>

14:59.160 --> 15:00.860
Wow. No jokes.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.870
The camera moved
automatically just now.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.579
This is a follow cam.
The camera follows movement.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.310
Everything is new to you, kiddo.

15:14.710 --> 15:17.750
- She's so cute.
- We should send her home.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.950
Sung-hun! Seung-wook!

15:22.560 --> 15:23.560
Good job!

15:25.560 --> 15:27.330
It's freezing when it gets dark.

15:27.430 --> 15:29.960
Hurry. The tent is warm.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.560
How was Gonjiam?

15:31.770 --> 15:34.100
It's there...

15:35.700 --> 15:38.270
Good job. Did you see the ghost?

15:39.140 --> 15:40.910
They are not there yet.

15:42.210 --> 15:43.340
I'm so hungry.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.979
- Good job.
- Really.

15:45.980 --> 15:47.509
I'm starving.
We should eat something.

15:47.510 --> 15:50.049
- Sweetie!
- I'm making noodles now.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.549
Good girl.
You're smart in that sense.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.250
- You're making it now?
- Yes.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.660
- Let's eat.
- It's done.

16:01.260 --> 16:04.160
- Tuck in.
- Do we have a ladle?

16:09.300 --> 16:11.040
It's good.

16:15.010 --> 16:16.240
Are you okay?

16:19.050 --> 16:19.810
Water, please.

16:20.050 --> 16:21.080
Are you okay?

16:21.210 --> 16:22.280
No, I'm not.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.289
- Wow, GoPro sessions!
- Dope!

16:27.290 --> 16:29.220
- So many of them!
- Are we bringing them all in?

16:29.290 --> 16:30.290
Of course.

16:31.220 --> 16:32.420
What is this?

16:35.230 --> 16:36.429
What's in Korean?

16:36.430 --> 16:37.800
A ghost detector.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.769
An electro-magnetic field
tester to be exact.

16:39.770 --> 16:43.600
The special magnetic field flows
where psychotic flow occurs.

16:43.970 --> 16:47.670
So people use this
to detect spirits.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.040
We usually call this EMF meter.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.120
It fits there.

17:04.420 --> 17:07.128
I'm fixing it in case you take
it off when you get too scared.

17:07.130 --> 17:08.660
You can only release it here.

17:08.930 --> 17:10.760
It makes me more nervous.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.829
Tighter tighter!

17:13.430 --> 17:15.940
Tighter.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.200
Yes, tighter!

17:18.839 --> 17:23.410
With this you can record your face
and your POV at the same time.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.540
- Wow.
- See.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.080
Dope!

17:32.090 --> 17:33.190
- Cool?
- Yes.

17:34.620 --> 17:38.590
So it's almost working
hours for the ghosts.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.599
Everyone must be nervous.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.630
Shall we head down?

17:48.600 --> 17:49.940
- Yes!
- Let's go!

17:52.970 --> 17:55.540
<i>Check Ah-yeon's face cam
and Je-yoon's POV cam.</i>

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
<i>I don't receive them.</i>

17:58.440 --> 17:59.480
And now?

18:01.850 --> 18:04.709
<i>It's okay. Sound check.
Say your name.</i>

18:04.710 --> 18:05.710
Sung-hun.

18:05.740 --> 18:06.260
Seung-wook.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.650
Charlotte.

18:08.390 --> 18:09.010
Ji-hyun.

18:09.390 --> 18:10.950
Je-yoon!

18:11.190 --> 18:12.620
Ah-yeon.

18:12.790 --> 18:14.090
<i>Sound check done.</i>

18:16.960 --> 18:17.960
Hey.

18:19.730 --> 18:21.560
I already feel a chill.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.730
- Something might come out.
- Right?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.430
Shall we use the EMF?

18:25.570 --> 18:28.540
Already? We're not even
near the entrance.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.040
Why, why?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.109
- Something just passed.
- I heard a flap.

18:34.110 --> 18:36.179
- Was it a bird?
- Bird?

18:36.180 --> 18:37.980
That freaked me out.

18:38.850 --> 18:39.880
Damn it.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.850
Be still, my heart.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.689
It's just it came out so suddenly.
I'm not afraid of anything.

18:49.690 --> 18:53.100
- You look so chicken-hearted.
- No.

18:53.780 --> 18:56.749
- You're lying.
- I'm not!

18:56.750 --> 18:58.050
Don't lie.

19:03.020 --> 19:04.490
Why are you laughing?

19:06.030 --> 19:07.260
What's this?

19:09.130 --> 19:10.199
What?

19:10.200 --> 19:11.900
- What is it?
- What is it?

19:14.570 --> 19:15.570
Tell us!

19:15.870 --> 19:17.440
Don't touch it.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.780
What happened exactly?

19:28.580 --> 19:30.720
Leave it there.
We can use it as a mark.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.480
- Right.
- Good idea.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.790
Someone's underwear as a mark...

19:49.640 --> 19:51.499
We've passed 12,000 views.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.540
We'll start to air in 5 mins.

20:02.550 --> 20:03.550
Careful.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.090
Be careful.

20:07.690 --> 20:08.790
Watch your steps.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.860
Why you wearing heels?

20:18.130 --> 20:19.200
- Be careful!
- Whew.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.340
Watch out!

20:25.270 --> 20:28.540
Shhh,
give me your hand, Ah-yeon.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.410
It's slippery here.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.210
Watch out, Charlotte.

20:38.050 --> 20:39.250
Look there.

20:42.190 --> 20:43.520
Dope.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.020
Damn it.

20:47.860 --> 20:49.690
So the top floor is the 4th?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.870
Yes the basement is
the first floor here.

20:54.570 --> 20:55.970
Where is room 402?

20:58.370 --> 21:00.370
I can't tell from outside.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.010
Rumor says if you take a shit
there, you can make it big.

21:05.780 --> 21:08.379
You should've told me earlier!
I already took a shit!

21:08.380 --> 21:09.710
Damn it.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.220
Let's go!

21:13.420 --> 21:14.450
Be careful.

21:15.990 --> 21:16.990
Why?

21:17.190 --> 21:19.320
Turn off your lights, everyone!

21:19.960 --> 21:21.260
Cover LED lights!

21:22.360 --> 21:24.000
- Cover them.
- Why?

21:24.300 --> 21:26.330
- It's not the patrol time.
- Shhh...

21:26.400 --> 21:27.530
Is it a cop?

21:29.740 --> 21:31.370
Be quiet and wait.

21:51.420 --> 21:52.620
Are they gone?

22:05.370 --> 22:08.840
This place is crazy.

22:24.290 --> 22:26.290
What are you doing, Ji-hyun?

22:26.590 --> 22:28.190
- Come here.
- I'm coming.

22:28.260 --> 22:30.900
- Let's move together.
- It's so scary.

22:34.030 --> 22:35.700
I'm scared.

22:56.090 --> 22:57.090
Look!

22:58.090 --> 23:00.490
This is the main entrance
leading to the 2nd floor.

23:01.690 --> 23:03.060
Let's get in.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.530
Go ahead.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.200
Wait for me.

23:11.700 --> 23:12.900
It's scary.

23:14.710 --> 23:15.940
Aren't you coming?

23:16.410 --> 23:17.740
Need to shoot from behind.

23:18.710 --> 23:19.710
Okay.

23:20.550 --> 23:21.580
Wanna leak.

23:21.610 --> 23:25.750
I'm shooting. You go ahead.
I'll shoot from behind.

23:26.490 --> 23:27.490
Got it.

23:32.290 --> 23:33.960
- Shall we go on?
- Yes.

23:34.390 --> 23:38.830
Crap, what shall I do? Is it for real?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.570
It's really terrifying.

23:46.740 --> 23:48.040
What's written on it?

23:48.810 --> 23:50.810
'Enter and you will die.'

23:50.910 --> 23:52.380
And 'Fuck it', afterwards...

23:53.550 --> 23:55.010
<i>Time to start airing.</i>

23:55.280 --> 23:56.920
Hey gather here. We're starting!

23:58.680 --> 23:59.680
Okay!

24:00.520 --> 24:01.990
<i>Stand by.</i>

24:02.220 --> 24:05.820
<i>Three, Two, One.</i>

24:06.730 --> 24:07.730
<i>Go!</i>

24:08.090 --> 24:10.719
We, Horror Times'
horror experience squad

24:10.720 --> 24:14.290
managed to sneak into the
prohibited Gonjiam asylum.

24:15.290 --> 24:19.360
Today is Oct. 26th.
And it just passed midnight.

24:19.600 --> 24:22.770
We can already get the
chill in this building

24:22.940 --> 24:25.740
where the spirits are
said to appear midnight.

24:27.310 --> 24:30.140
Korea's first live horror show ever!

24:30.610 --> 24:31.880
Gonjiam horror experience

24:32.450 --> 24:33.880
begins now!

24:34.280 --> 24:36.320
Very good opening, Seung-wook.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.790
VR first and get in!

24:38.090 --> 24:40.150
- Hurry, hurry!
- Let's go!

24:47.030 --> 24:48.630
<i>Music!</i>

24:50.030 --> 24:51.700
- Enter.
- Enter.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.120
<i>Seung-wook, stand by.</i>

25:09.420 --> 25:10.420
<i>Go!</i>

25:10.620 --> 25:13.420
It is four past midnight.

25:14.790 --> 25:19.460
We're finally inside
of Gonjiam asylum.

25:24.330 --> 25:25.729
Here's the lobby.

25:25.730 --> 25:27.870
<i>'Someone's living here...'</i>

25:30.610 --> 25:32.040
I'm getting a chill.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.240
You always get the chill.

25:34.610 --> 25:36.410
What do you want me to get?
Chocked?

25:39.050 --> 25:40.050
Hang on.

25:40.450 --> 25:43.150
Here's the hallway on the 2nd floor.

25:45.020 --> 25:49.720
The rooms are lined on both sides.

25:51.790 --> 25:55.630
There are lots of garbage
on the floor.

25:57.370 --> 26:00.370
We're approaching the reception desk.

26:00.570 --> 26:02.940
Ji-hyun and Charlotte,
you go ahead.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.380
Where is it? It's here.

26:14.850 --> 26:15.920
Here.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.880
<i>Ji-hyun, stand by. Go!</i>

26:33.350 --> 26:35.319
Charlotte pours the holy water

26:35.320 --> 26:38.590
she took from Myung-dong
Cathedral into a bowl.

26:39.220 --> 26:43.230
We're going to put a
camera and capture ghosts.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.100
<i>Seung-wook, your line.</i>

26:52.940 --> 26:57.010
We already set up the
high-tech equipments

26:57.280 --> 27:01.680
at the spots of supernatural
phenomena and ghost appearance.

27:01.980 --> 27:04.520
Let me brief you the rundown of...

27:06.020 --> 27:07.490
What is it?

27:09.220 --> 27:10.220
Where?

27:10.490 --> 27:11.320
Where is it?

27:11.360 --> 27:13.290
Was it the director's room?

27:13.390 --> 27:15.530
It closed by itself. Didn't it?

27:16.460 --> 27:19.029
This is real, everyone.

27:19.030 --> 27:21.470
The door of the director's
room got closed by itself.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.670
We will go and check.

27:31.510 --> 27:33.180
I'm horrified.

27:45.820 --> 27:48.290
<i>DIRECTOR'S ROOM.</i>

28:14.190 --> 28:17.220
We're now in the director's room.

28:19.690 --> 28:21.430
Might be a coincidence but

28:21.690 --> 28:23.960
just before, the door
got closed by itself.

28:25.930 --> 28:30.469
It's the phenomenon many people
who came here witnessed.

28:30.470 --> 28:31.410
Look at this!

28:31.411 --> 28:32.970
- What?
- Come here, hurry!

28:36.780 --> 28:38.510
<i>Sung-hun, zoom in the picture.</i>

28:39.850 --> 28:40.650
<i>Seung-wook your line.</i>

28:40.720 --> 28:42.150
Seung-wook, your line.

28:42.680 --> 28:47.350
Seems like a group photo of the
patients and hospital crews.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.020
It looks like an ordinary group photo

28:50.160 --> 28:52.090
but if you take a closer
look, something is off.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.860
- All stare at...
- Different directions...

28:56.700 --> 28:58.529
And the woman in the center seems to be

28:58.530 --> 29:02.500
the director who is rumored to kill
all the patients and disappear.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.570
- She looks creepy.
- I agree.

29:04.670 --> 29:07.010
We found other pictures.

29:08.980 --> 29:11.710
Director getting the award.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.779
Her playing ping pong.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.450
Guess this lady was
fond of ping pong.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.250
That can explain the
sound of ping pong ball.

29:19.350 --> 29:21.560
Stop it! You scare me!

29:21.760 --> 29:24.060
What is it? Over there...

29:30.030 --> 29:31.030
Wow...

29:31.130 --> 29:34.770
It reads.' The people who read.'

29:35.140 --> 29:37.910
Seems like people read
some books back then.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.310
- From President Park Jung-hee.
- That's a surprise!

29:41.410 --> 29:45.950
- By the way, who's Park Jung-hee?
- Ex-president.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.180
Ex-president, Father of
the very former one.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.650
Was her father a president, too?

29:52.990 --> 29:53.990
Charlotte...

29:59.530 --> 30:00.460
What the hell?

30:00.461 --> 30:03.100
- I was so surprised...
- This really freaks out.

30:04.030 --> 30:05.400
Is that hair?

30:06.770 --> 30:09.070
- Not a person?
- No.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.270
Let's wrap it up.

30:14.340 --> 30:19.180
Luckily we've found some
pictures and shown them you.

30:19.850 --> 30:22.380
I and Sung-hun are going to prepare

30:22.620 --> 30:26.550
the mediumistic ritual to bring
out the revengeful spirits

30:26.720 --> 30:29.589
of the patients who were unfairly killed.

30:29.590 --> 30:30.859
Meanwhile, other members

30:30.860 --> 30:35.930
will introduce you the horror spots
on the 1st, 3rd and 4th floors.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.770
Everything will be live, of course.

30:39.570 --> 30:42.400
Everyone, move to the spots and stand
by while I'm playing the replay.

30:43.270 --> 30:44.939
<i>For supernatural phenomena
and ghosts' appearance.</i>

30:44.940 --> 30:47.410
<i>Let me brief you the rundown of...</i>

31:08.220 --> 31:10.020
<i>Charlotte and Ji-hyun
on the 1st floor, ready?</i>

31:10.090 --> 31:11.020
Yeap!

31:11.030 --> 31:12.790
<i>Time for the horror spots.</i>

31:13.090 --> 31:15.400
<i>Ready, Go!</i>

31:16.160 --> 31:18.300
I am on the 1st floor now.

31:18.570 --> 31:25.140
And Charlotte who's already experienced
3 among CNN's 7 freakiest places

31:25.310 --> 31:28.310
is leaving her signature to
celebrate her 4th experience.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.780
Charlotte?

31:31.950 --> 31:35.219
After Sedlec Ossuary in Czech,

31:35.220 --> 31:39.049
Aokigahara Forest in Japan, and the
Island of the Dolls in Mexico,

31:39.050 --> 31:41.190
among CNN's 7 freakiest places,

31:41.220 --> 31:44.630
I, Charlotte finally
arrived at Gonjiam asylum!

31:45.560 --> 31:49.300
I left my signature as a token
just like the other places.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.900
And I can see someone
wrote 'Let's live' here.

31:57.310 --> 31:58.770
Move to the corridor.

32:02.780 --> 32:06.010
'Someone lives here', it says.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.180
What?

32:07.250 --> 32:09.750
No, it says it's ghosts living here.

32:11.020 --> 32:13.650
Damn. Ghosts live here, everyone.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.120
And we are at the place
where ghosts live.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.930
And there are weird
writings on the wall.

32:21.030 --> 32:22.030
Ji-hyun.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.670
Look at this.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.400
Why is this turning off?

32:29.940 --> 32:31.269
<i>LABORATORY.</i>

32:31.270 --> 32:33.010
This is the lab, everyone.

32:33.370 --> 32:34.840
Lets go in.

32:53.130 --> 32:54.430
What the heck?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.500
The inside seems like the lab.

33:01.770 --> 33:03.340
Water on the floor.

33:05.270 --> 33:06.940
The water is leaking.

33:07.180 --> 33:11.180
Numerous medical charts
scattered on the floor.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.010
Burnt trace on the wall, too.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.350
Cabinets are collapsed on the floor.

33:21.620 --> 33:23.190
Here is the laboratory.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.220
There are tiles on the walls,

33:30.760 --> 33:34.160
and most of them are shattered
as if the room was bombed.

33:35.230 --> 33:38.930
On the floor there are IVs, needles...

33:39.830 --> 33:41.940
and a microscope.

33:44.110 --> 33:47.170
Also there are lots of medicine bottles.

33:53.820 --> 33:55.350
And a doll, too.

33:58.060 --> 34:01.220
It's the spot my friend
took the psychic picture.

34:02.420 --> 34:03.720
Check it out.

34:04.280 --> 34:07.790
Here's the spot where my
friend took the picture

34:07.800 --> 34:09.099
when she came here last year.

34:09.100 --> 34:12.300
It was real. Point the camera at me.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.770
Are you okay?

34:17.370 --> 34:19.170
- What is it?
- What the hell?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.239
- What is that smell?
- Oh my...

34:24.310 --> 34:25.350
Is that a chicken?

34:26.080 --> 34:29.280
Let's go out. We will leave here first.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.350
<i>Good job you two.
Move to the 4th floor.</i>

34:33.690 --> 34:34.789
Je-yoon and Ah-yeon on the 3rd floor.

34:34.790 --> 34:36.920
Stand by and go!

34:38.460 --> 34:39.460
Welcome back.

34:40.159 --> 34:43.800
Ah-yeon and I are in the
hallway of the 3rd floor.

34:45.469 --> 34:47.830
We are only one floor upper

34:48.440 --> 34:50.670
but it feels colder here.

34:51.670 --> 34:54.210
We will check the temperature.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.010
Ah-yeon?

34:58.250 --> 34:59.410
It's 13 Celsius.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.180
13 Celsius.

35:02.950 --> 35:05.790
It's 13 Celsius on the 3rd floor.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.460
What about the 2nd floor earlier?

35:09.260 --> 35:10.560
13 Celsius.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.960
...The temperature is the same.

35:17.830 --> 35:22.670
But there's a thing called
sensory temperature.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.239
The sensory temperature I feel
on the 3rd floor right now

35:27.240 --> 35:29.679
is about minus 13 Celsius.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.480
- There's a ping pong table!
- What?

35:33.180 --> 35:36.180
There really is a ping pong
table as rumor says it.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.220
There's a dead bird.

35:44.590 --> 35:47.460
<i>Je-yoon calm down a bit.</i>

35:58.310 --> 35:59.310
What now?

35:59.710 --> 36:01.710
Introduction of the 3rd floor!

36:03.880 --> 36:08.080
Right, we'll now show you
the rooms on the 3rd floor.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.520
You must know well too,

36:11.690 --> 36:16.220
umm, people who've been here
often said they witnessed

36:17.220 --> 36:20.990
supernatural phenomena
on the 1st and 2nd floors

36:21.460 --> 36:26.670
and actual ghosts here on
this floor and the 4th floor.

36:28.300 --> 36:31.870
They are said to be haunted spirits
of patients wrongly killed.

36:32.540 --> 36:36.680
We will now...
check out these rooms.

37:01.170 --> 37:02.440
What the...

37:04.870 --> 37:07.070
<i>Je-yoon your line.</i>

37:09.340 --> 37:10.379
Alright.

37:10.380 --> 37:15.450
This is the shower room where
ghosts were seen many times.

37:16.280 --> 37:19.090
You can see on that wall inside

37:19.920 --> 37:24.990
an old stain in shape of a person.

37:25.890 --> 37:28.090
Please zoom onto it, Ah-yeon.

37:29.930 --> 37:34.470
- It does look like a person.
- That is a so-called 'ghost spot'.

37:35.870 --> 37:38.000
That we don't want to believe...

37:39.710 --> 37:46.910
Anyway we, horror experience squad,
installed this follow cam and a go pro

37:47.080 --> 37:53.790
on this highest spot to confirm
the existence of the ghost.

37:55.860 --> 38:03.230
Now we're finally going further
into the bathing room.

38:23.750 --> 38:25.750
Here we are.

38:26.450 --> 38:27.450
I can see...

38:29.420 --> 38:30.890
There! That!

38:31.390 --> 38:32.960
What is it? What's that?

38:33.960 --> 38:35.730
Damn it! What is it?

38:50.710 --> 38:52.010
Holy...

38:55.100 --> 38:56.400
It's a wig.

38:57.670 --> 38:59.110
Shit, put that away!

38:59.540 --> 39:01.040
It's so freaking scary!
Put it away.

39:01.180 --> 39:03.079
I said put that away!
Don't do that!

39:03.080 --> 39:04.710
Don't! Damn it!

39:04.810 --> 39:06.080
Don't do it! I warned you!

39:06.480 --> 39:09.580
- You damn...
- Why is it here?

39:11.490 --> 39:13.290
Somebody must've left it for a joke.

39:13.790 --> 39:15.689
Don't do that! I warned you!

39:15.690 --> 39:19.030
I'm serious!
You think I'm kidding?

39:20.890 --> 39:22.200
That's it for the 3rd floor...

39:22.400 --> 39:24.360
Ji-hyun and Charlotte
on the 4th, stand by.

39:25.350 --> 39:26.350
Action!

39:27.300 --> 39:32.170
This is the hallway of 4th floor
the top ghost spot in the asylum.

39:32.670 --> 39:36.480
Here are our state-of-the-art
equipment to trace the ghosts.

39:37.710 --> 39:40.280
The ceiling is equipped with
6 flash lights with infrared censor

39:40.310 --> 39:45.020
responding to a slightest
movement and the minimum energy.

39:45.120 --> 39:48.420
We will now only have to wait
until the ghost is spotted.

39:49.290 --> 39:50.590
<i>Now to Ji-hyun.</i>

39:51.690 --> 39:56.900
This is the climax of horror
experience, the infamous room 402

39:57.060 --> 40:01.070
where no one has been in since
the closure of the hospital.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.400
The room used to be
the intensive care room.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.540
So many people challenging
Gonjiam asylum tried to open

40:07.610 --> 40:11.000
this door which has been closed
for so long.

40:11.550 --> 40:14.710
But every single one of them failed

40:14.720 --> 40:18.680
and were said to either have
committed strange suicides,

40:18.690 --> 40:21.289
fallen in comas or died in accidents.

40:21.290 --> 40:24.420
So people call it as
the curse of room 402.

40:24.690 --> 40:29.860
We tried to see with our
eyes if it never opens.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.280
No, I can't open it.

40:46.410 --> 40:47.650
Did you all see it?

40:47.710 --> 40:50.119
The door is closed as a solid rock.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.219
But! Later,

40:51.220 --> 40:57.020
we'll be the first ones to open
and shoot inside of room 402.

40:57.360 --> 41:03.230
We'll get to the bottom of
the mystery of this room.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.730
Okay, great!

41:11.270 --> 41:13.110
55,000 views.

41:18.380 --> 41:22.819
<i>COLLECTIVE CARE ROOM 1ST FLOOR.</i>

41:22.820 --> 41:27.819
<i>CORRIDOR, 2ND FLOOR.</i>

41:27.820 --> 41:32.329
<i>SUPPLY ROOM. 3RD FLOOR.</i>

41:32.330 --> 41:36.829
<i>SHOWER ROOM, 3RD FLOOR.</i>

41:36.830 --> 41:41.330
<i>BATHING ROOM. 3RD FLOOR.</i>

41:41.340 --> 41:45.840
<i>ROOM 402.</i>

41:45.910 --> 41:49.409
You will wait here until
I finish shooting the intro

41:49.410 --> 41:51.910
and follow me while I
go around the room.

41:52.250 --> 41:54.649
Make sure to shoot at your positions

41:54.650 --> 41:56.750
in any cases during the ritual.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.120
Let's begin the ritual.

42:01.250 --> 42:03.620
<i>Music is... on.</i>

42:34.620 --> 42:37.090
<i>Seung-wook, your turn.</i>

42:38.160 --> 42:43.500
Now I am in the director's room, the
place for our mediumistic ritual.

42:45.900 --> 42:46.900
Can you see these?

42:47.370 --> 42:53.240
The red strings attached with small
bells are hanging like a spider web.

42:59.110 --> 43:02.149
Amulet, millet, and cinnabar

43:02.150 --> 43:06.490
are prepared on the
table for the ritual.

43:08.260 --> 43:09.359
Now!

43:09.360 --> 43:13.230
We will perform the dangerous
ritual to call out the ghosts.

43:13.660 --> 43:17.730
I'd leave this room this minute if it
were not for the live broadcasting.

43:18.170 --> 43:20.530
I'm that much scared and nervous but!

43:20.700 --> 43:25.340
We will keep our promise to
broadcast this ritual all live.

43:26.410 --> 43:30.240
Ah-yeon, the youngest member,
will conduct the ritual.

43:33.340 --> 43:34.610
Ah-yeon, let's begin.

43:42.290 --> 43:45.160
She puts lights on the incense

43:58.710 --> 44:01.170
and burns the amulet

44:03.380 --> 44:06.750
filled with spell calling out
the haunted spirits.

44:07.250 --> 44:11.080
A monk at Bomoon Temple
generously offered us the amulet.

44:17.870 --> 44:20.330
Get up and put your hands together.

44:29.990 --> 44:32.740
Now we will sit together
and wait to see

44:33.520 --> 44:34.600
what happens...

45:10.640 --> 45:12.410
The candle light is flickering.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.650
What is it?

45:19.520 --> 45:20.650
Gosh!

45:27.790 --> 45:29.150
What the heck?

45:30.860 --> 45:31.860
What is it?

45:32.790 --> 45:34.990
- Damn it!
- What the hell is it?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.430
What? What? What's going on?

45:44.570 --> 45:45.570
To where!

45:52.750 --> 45:53.909
Jesus Christ...

45:53.910 --> 45:57.150
Did you all see the
surveillance camera turned?

45:57.350 --> 45:59.080
It is not a joke!

45:59.150 --> 46:00.950
The rumors were all true!

46:01.450 --> 46:02.860
Did you all shoot it?

46:03.030 --> 46:04.360
I missed it completely.

46:04.900 --> 46:07.290
This place is of another level.

46:07.550 --> 46:09.399
Don't scare me.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.830
<i>Comment Seung-wook!</i>

46:11.110 --> 46:13.270
<i>Put everyone in the frame,
Sung-hun.</i>

46:14.000 --> 46:17.070
<i>Stand by, go!</i>

46:17.870 --> 46:21.170
Did you all see that? I still
can't believe my own eyes.

46:21.200 --> 46:25.069
The place is closed off from outside.

46:25.070 --> 46:27.379
But soon after the ritual began

46:27.380 --> 46:31.480
the candle, the bells, and
the camera moved by itself.

46:32.080 --> 46:34.680
As if someone's not happy
about our challenge.

46:35.450 --> 46:38.020
But we promise you that
we'll finish our mission

46:38.090 --> 46:41.020
whatever risk lies ahead of us.

46:41.860 --> 46:43.360
Don't go anywhere.

46:43.690 --> 46:44.790
<i>Okay!</i>

46:44.960 --> 46:48.090
<i>Move to the next spot.
I'll air the replay.</i>

46:50.370 --> 46:53.250
<i>She puts light on the incense. .</i>

47:10.380 --> 47:13.090
- Yes, captain.
- <i>They didn't notice, did they?</i>

47:13.620 --> 47:15.860
No, they absolutely freaked out.

47:17.390 --> 47:18.660
Did it look real?

47:19.030 --> 47:21.300
Sure. It rocked!

47:21.700 --> 47:22.970
What is the number now?

47:23.820 --> 47:25.020
100K views!

47:25.150 --> 47:27.020
- 100K, really?
- Unbelievable!

47:27.920 --> 47:30.160
<i>We've got the good start,</i>

47:30.220 --> 47:33.130
so we need to do it right
to reach 1 million views.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.600
Double-check the settings
and lead their reactions.

47:36.700 --> 47:37.700
Got it!

47:37.760 --> 47:40.930
I think Charlotte's
reactions are killing it.

47:41.070 --> 47:43.270
I'll try to incite her more.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.340
<i>Good. Make sure that
they'd not find out.</i>

47:46.640 --> 47:49.710
Even a ghost cannot. Gotta go.

48:11.100 --> 48:12.100
Shit.

48:17.640 --> 48:18.840
What the hell!

48:24.310 --> 48:26.180
You're kidding me?

48:33.350 --> 48:34.420
What...

48:36.720 --> 48:38.420
Come on.

48:43.130 --> 48:45.030
Perfect. Perfect timing.

49:06.220 --> 49:07.690
What now?

49:39.590 --> 49:42.590
So we are now in the lab

49:42.760 --> 49:45.190
on the 1st floor after the ritual.

49:45.590 --> 49:49.429
We're a bit eased but like
all of you watching online

49:49.430 --> 49:54.430
we still can't figure out
how to explain what's just happened.

49:55.330 --> 49:59.300
Anyway we'll stick to our plan
and go into the lab.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.690
The entire room smells weird.

50:25.300 --> 50:28.930
- This is the lab?
- It's further inside.

50:30.140 --> 50:31.840
Isn't it dope?

50:34.740 --> 50:39.710
This is the inside of the lab.

50:42.150 --> 50:43.850
That's the stench.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.150
I broke a glass bottle before.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.520
On the floor, left side. Can you see?

50:50.020 --> 50:52.320
Something like a dead chicken.
That's what stinks.

50:52.330 --> 50:57.430
Hold on. Why ls there a
doll in the lab room?

50:59.130 --> 51:00.230
Are you kidding?

51:01.230 --> 51:04.570
It wasn't there before. Right Ji-hyun?

51:05.970 --> 51:08.170
It was in the cabinet, not there.

51:08.410 --> 51:09.140
What?

51:09.141 --> 51:11.039
The doll was in the cabinet!

51:11.040 --> 51:13.450
<i>Zoom in onto the doll.</i>

51:17.680 --> 51:22.050
<i>Looks like the doll in the picture.
A patient was holding it.</i>

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
No way.

51:26.090 --> 51:28.489
Is someone else here?

51:28.490 --> 51:30.530
What are you doing?

51:30.960 --> 51:32.929
What are you doing? Don't touch it.

51:32.930 --> 51:35.329
No!!!
Don't touch it! Put it back!

51:35.330 --> 51:37.499
Put it down! Lee Seung-wook!

51:37.500 --> 51:38.699
Hey, put it down now!

51:38.700 --> 51:40.569
Right now! Put it down!

51:40.570 --> 51:42.170
- Seung-wook.
- Shoot this, quick!

51:42.770 --> 51:44.870
Can't you just put it down?

51:46.440 --> 51:47.680
Charlotte!

51:49.580 --> 51:51.410
Je-yoon, follow her.

51:53.380 --> 51:54.520
Captain, check it out!

51:59.640 --> 52:01.340
<i>Yes. That's the same doll.</i>

52:02.000 --> 52:04.940
Captain said it's the same one.
Why is he touching it?

52:05.240 --> 52:06.940
Charlotte, calm down.

52:06.950 --> 52:08.949
You just can't randomly touch
things in places like this.

52:08.950 --> 52:10.449
<i>Ji-hyun! You saw it too.</i>

52:10.450 --> 52:12.880
<i>The doll was in the cabinet!</i>

52:13.050 --> 52:14.020
<i>Are we the only people in here?</i>

52:14.021 --> 52:16.820
I will put the picture on screen,
your comment, Seung wook.

52:17.890 --> 52:19.820
Stand by, go!

52:20.660 --> 52:24.160
You see this doll I'm holding?

52:25.250 --> 52:26.570
Don't be shocked.

52:27.100 --> 52:30.440
This doll which Charlotte
claims was in the cabinet

52:30.940 --> 52:34.740
is the doll from the picture
in the director's room

52:34.810 --> 52:38.110
where we performed the ritual.

52:38.710 --> 52:40.860
Please compare them.

52:41.800 --> 52:46.350
Why has this doll shown up

52:46.790 --> 52:49.320
and has it moved itself?

52:50.070 --> 52:54.340
Is there really a supernatural
energy in this place?

52:55.470 --> 52:59.470
Strange things keep happening here.
It's all real

52:59.890 --> 53:03.070
and you're watching all live!

53:04.380 --> 53:06.100
<i>Good, we'll be back soon...</i>

53:14.510 --> 53:16.810
You're fucking natural born actors!

53:18.760 --> 53:22.320
I can't stay here.
I want to leave.

53:22.690 --> 53:24.190
Charlotte, how can we leave?

53:28.590 --> 53:30.830
<i>This is really weird.</i>

53:31.630 --> 53:35.130
- We can't just leave.
- Yeah, Charlotte.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.240
Stop shooting, Ah-yeon.

53:39.390 --> 53:41.840
- I'm sorry, Charlotte.
- You too, stop shooting!

53:43.810 --> 53:44.810
Lee Seung-wook!

53:44.940 --> 53:46.640
You never touch things
in places like this!

53:46.650 --> 53:48.150
They're cursed!

53:48.310 --> 53:50.820
You can be in a serious trouble!

53:50.980 --> 53:51.680
Sorry.

53:51.720 --> 53:55.650
I just wanted to check as I
couldn't believe my eyes.

53:56.020 --> 53:57.020
Damn it...

53:57.490 --> 53:58.819
We should give her some time...

53:58.820 --> 54:00.729
It's more dangerous to be on her own.

54:00.730 --> 54:02.929
Let's just finish up and
get out of here, okay?

54:02.930 --> 54:04.500
<i>Do you all hear me?</i>

54:06.060 --> 54:10.100
<i>If everyone wants to quit here,
I will follow your decision..</i>

54:11.200 --> 54:14.810
<i>Then all we have done so far
would turn into nothing.</i>

54:14.970 --> 54:17.310
Let's hang in there a bit,
shall we?

54:18.110 --> 54:22.810
<i>Wrap this up as safely as
possible just as Charlotte said.</i>

54:22.850 --> 54:27.950
Yes, we are here together,
so let's finish this together.

54:29.620 --> 54:30.890
Okay then.

54:32.390 --> 54:34.890
Hey, you never do anything risky!

54:34.930 --> 54:37.090
Yes, ma'am. I won't touch a thing!

54:37.100 --> 54:37.730
I am so sorry.

54:37.731 --> 54:40.729
- Never! I mean it.
- Alright, I got it.

54:40.730 --> 54:42.229
<i>It's a break.</i>

54:42.230 --> 54:44.240
<i>Let's move to the next
spot and stand by.</i>

54:44.900 --> 54:47.310
Je-yoon and Ah-yeon go to the 4th floor.

54:47.740 --> 54:49.939
You'll be on air soon.

54:49.940 --> 54:51.939
<i>Install the infrared
flashes on the ceiling.</i>

54:51.940 --> 54:53.079
Yes, captain.

54:53.080 --> 54:54.180
Can we take a minute?

54:54.450 --> 54:57.720
<i>When the 1st floor is done well
be go short on the 3rd and 4th.</i>

54:57.820 --> 55:00.180
<i>Seung-wook and Sung-hun, let
me know when you're ready.</i>

55:00.190 --> 55:01.220
- Alright.
- Sure.

55:01.320 --> 55:03.550
Can we just take a minute? Please?

55:05.320 --> 55:06.820
- Don't do that again, ever!
- Got it!

55:07.030 --> 55:09.890
- Can't you hear me?
- Let's move!

55:14.570 --> 55:16.070
Are you alright, Charlotte?

55:16.700 --> 55:19.070
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

55:19.540 --> 55:23.110
<i>Everyone stand by and...</i>

55:23.240 --> 55:24.240
<i>Go!</i>

55:34.450 --> 55:37.150
This is the collective care room.

55:37.860 --> 55:39.490
Take a look inside.

55:40.990 --> 55:42.690
The ceiling has fallen in

55:42.830 --> 55:46.300
and small wooden closets
surround the walls.

55:46.870 --> 55:49.700
It looks like a catacomb

55:49.970 --> 55:52.870
bombarded during the war.

55:55.940 --> 55:58.340
The patients were given
so-called treatments

55:59.080 --> 56:02.310
in these small wooden closets.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.550
So creepy.

56:07.490 --> 56:11.690
Well, I will look into
this coffin with a door.

56:12.660 --> 56:17.660
Strangely, there's a hole the
chest level, not on the face.

56:18.100 --> 56:19.600
What was this hole for?

56:20.200 --> 56:22.070
Not for the surveillance. I guess.

56:22.130 --> 56:24.240
Let me open the door.

56:25.640 --> 56:27.240
There's no knob.

56:32.340 --> 56:33.440
Why? What's wrong?

56:33.750 --> 56:35.050
- Shit.
- Why?

56:35.950 --> 56:36.810
Why?

56:36.820 --> 56:38.879
- Someone pulled my arm.
- What?

56:38.880 --> 56:41.319
Stop messing around, I warned you.

56:41.320 --> 56:43.020
I'm not kidding!

56:43.160 --> 56:45.860
I told you! This place
is fucking cursed!

56:46.060 --> 56:47.829
<i>Seung-wook, put in your hand.</i>

56:47.830 --> 56:49.089
<i>Sung-hun, shake the camera more.</i>

56:49.090 --> 56:51.030
Seung-wook, your line.

56:52.630 --> 56:56.530
Someone did pull my
arm inside that door.

56:57.300 --> 57:00.670
I can't tell exactly 'cause
it happened too fast.

57:00.810 --> 57:03.610
So I will put my arm in there again.

57:03.810 --> 57:06.610
- Are you insane?
- Don't do it!

57:07.310 --> 57:08.850
Stop him!

57:08.880 --> 57:11.680
- Don't do it! Please don't!
- Why not?

57:11.980 --> 57:13.620
Let me do it!

57:13.850 --> 57:15.220
Hey, don't!

57:16.720 --> 57:19.360
- It's too dangerous!
- Stop her right now! Quick!

57:20.690 --> 57:23.330
Okay, alright. I got it!

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Take this.

57:25.230 --> 57:26.230
<i>No!</i>

57:31.930 --> 57:32.930
Nothing...

57:34.140 --> 57:35.700
Ji-hyun! Ji-hyun!

57:36.240 --> 57:37.710
- <i>What is going on?</i>
- Captain!

57:38.840 --> 57:40.370
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Do something! Ji-hyun!

57:50.720 --> 57:52.150
Ji-hyun your arm...

58:42.800 --> 58:45.070
They scream like they
ride the pirate ship.

58:51.280 --> 58:53.880
- I hear the ping pong ball!
- Get the EMF out.

59:03.260 --> 59:07.590
It was written 'Let's live'
but changed into 'Let's die'!

59:08.660 --> 59:09.800
Are you sure?

59:10.170 --> 59:12.099
This place is cursed.

59:12.100 --> 59:15.469
We have to leave... or
we are all gonna die.

59:15.470 --> 59:17.469
Let's leave, Charlotte.
I can't be here any longer.

59:17.470 --> 59:19.739
- What are you doing?
- We are leaving.

59:19.740 --> 59:22.680
- Hey, Ji-hyun.
- Look at this.

59:23.110 --> 59:25.280
We never know what comes next.

59:25.580 --> 59:27.920
We're cursed. What shall I do?

59:28.350 --> 59:32.120
- Hey...
- Move away, will you?

59:32.220 --> 59:34.119
Captain! You hear us?

59:34.120 --> 59:37.090
- Calm down.
- You saw it too!

59:37.560 --> 59:40.959
You saw what happened at
the mediumistic ritual.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.460
It even pulled my scarf, too.

59:43.930 --> 59:47.460
And it grabbed your arm
too like it did to mine.

59:47.530 --> 59:49.670
And the letters on the wall changed!

59:49.700 --> 59:52.370
Listen, Ji-hyun... the truth is...
at the ritual...

59:52.440 --> 59:55.369
Hey! We're scared too.
We're frightened but...

59:55.370 --> 59:57.880
we're on board together so
let's finish and leave together.

59:57.910 --> 01:00:00.210
Even captain doesn't know what to say!

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:03.950
If any shit happens who
will take care of that?

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.750
Move! We're leaving. Let's go.

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:35.510
Be careful, Charlotte.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:54.930
<i>I can see someone wrote
Let's Live' here.</i>

01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840
<i>Hey bro!</i>

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:01.950
<i>Bro!</i>

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:03.370
<i>Ha-joon!</i>

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720
Say something!

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:08.349
Yes, Seung-wook.

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.180
Why didn't you say anything!

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.350
The connection is bad.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.780
Ji-hyun and Charlotte left.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:15.390
<i>I know. I saw.</i>

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:17.450
I checked the letters on the wall.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.760
Did they change?

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.160
<i>Are you kidding? No way.</i>

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.560
It was 'let's die' from the beginning.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.329
I'm just speechless.

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.700
<i>Then what is wrong with them?</i>

01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:30.200
Don't know. They're just freaked out.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.940
<i>Charlotte was already panicking
since you touched the doll in the lab.</i>

01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.809
But you just saw it, too.

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.509
Ji-hyun's arm pulled and
Charlotte's scarf, too.

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:41.380
It seemed like Ji-hyun was faking.

01:01:42.010 --> 01:01:44.510
<i>She seemed to figure about our show.</i>

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.450
Why the hell would she fake it?

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.950
How should I know? Maybe
she just wanted to leave?

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.250
- Then the scar on her arm?
- Right.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.960
There might have been thorns inside.

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:54.160
<i>How about Charlotte?</i>

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.870
- I saw her scarf with my own eyes!
- I filmed it too!

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.430
That's what I find strange, too,
so I keep checking the video.

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:03.799
Was there any wind blowing in?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.670
It's fucking closed underground!
How could the wind blow in?

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:11.400
There must be something.
Freaking strange. Let's stop here.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.600
You think you can
fucking quit like that?

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.520
<i>Listen carefully. We
have to finish this.</i>

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:22.919
Do you know how many are the views now?

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.560
More than 300K! What if we stop now?

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.429
No ad for the halted broadcasting!

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:30.510
<i>Let's try just little more.</i>

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:33.510
<i>A brief tour on the 3rd
floor and open room 402,</i>

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.310
<i>and it's a wrap.</i>

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.640
What if something happens!

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:38.310
I will buy some time
playing a short replay...

01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:39.840
- <i>Let's go live again...</i>
- Screw it.

01:02:41.810 --> 01:02:43.850
<i>Seung-wook... Lee Seung-wook!</i>

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:45.950
<i>Come back!</i>

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:47.590
Hey, you!

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.270
Damn it!

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.050
I shouldn't have signed on the wall.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.820
I'm cursed and might actually die.

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.560
That's why we left. It should be okay.

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.230
- You saw it too.
- Charlotte!

01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:05.070
- Under my name, It's written...
- I said we'd be okay!

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.310
<i>What should I do?</i>

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.340
Get up!

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.650
Get up!

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:15.250
Charlotte.

01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.850
We go back to the base camp now

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.120
and can go home in the morning.

01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:24.050
Let's go home.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.220
We can go home.

01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:30.090
Let's go home.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.860
We can go home.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:37.800
You see?

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:41.740
The scarf is pulled up by itself.
It's not the wind.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:47.440
Let's get out of here
with Je-yoon and Ah-yeon.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.880
- Bro.
- Yeah.

01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:52.120
Hey, let's make a deal.

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:53.649
What?

01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:57.190
If we end here everything
becomes useless.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:01.020
300K view can earn $150K for ads.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.529
Let's ask for 20% more we
can get at least $40K each.

01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:05.860
Continue this?

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.470
As if someone's not happy...

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.610
Ji-hyun...

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.449
Je-yoon,

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:23.949
Seung-wook and Ah-yeon...

01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:26.650
Charlotte and Sung-hoon,
all six are there.

01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.390
Who the hell shot this then?

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.890
What the heck! No!

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:37.890
No, don't do this to me!

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:38.600
No!

01:04:38.601 --> 01:04:39.900
No way!

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:43.090
Damn it!

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:55.949
As if someone's not happy...

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:57.010
<i>Ha-joon.</i>

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:01.220
Yeah.

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:03.020
We have some conditions.

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:04.550
<i>What conditions?</i>

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.660
Raise our shares by 20% each.
Then we're in.

01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:09.890
And for the others, too.

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.720
<i>What do you say? Yes or no?</i>

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:24.030
Okay for 20% more for
you and the others, too.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.920
<i>We're going back live
when the replay is done.</i>

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.310
<i>Hurry to the 3rd floor.</i>

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.610
Don't ever cut the radio again.

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.220
Or I will kill you.

01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:41.690
Was it this far?

01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:45.050
It's taking too long.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.300
Look at that!

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.229
We're right on track.

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:51.130
We put it there on the way.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.400
We're almost there.

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:57.670
Almost there. Let's go.

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:10.990
<i>SHOWER ROOM.</i>

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:13.620
What you see is the shower room

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.830
one of the top two ghost spots along
with the hallway of 4th floor

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.970
in this asylum.

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:24.980
Looking up,

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:28.520
you can see the follow cams.

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.760
But no particular signs so far.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:39.130
What is this sound?

01:06:40.530 --> 01:06:41.700
Is it from supply room?

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.270
<i>Leave the shower room,
move to the supply room!</i>

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:50.270
<i>Both of you, fast!</i>

01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:12.130
<i>Seung-wook, your line.</i>

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.330
We just heard strange
sound coming from here,

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.000
the supply room.

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:25.170
You must've heard it, too.

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.709
A loud sound of something

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:31.480
being crashed against the wall.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:35.620
What was the sound?

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.060
<i>Sung-hoon, go behind
the cabinet and shoot it!</i>

01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:52.240
Seung-wook, say something first!

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.170
Bro!

01:07:54.490 --> 01:07:56.290
Say it!

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.150
Did you all see that?

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.270
What if there's...

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:14.860
the supernatural energy...

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:26.000
Sung-hun!

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.569
Seung-wook!

01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:58.870
Lee Seung-wook!

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:04.609
Hey!

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:05.740
Wake up!

01:09:08.979 --> 01:09:10.149
Seung-wook, please!

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:37.210
Why?

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:38.670
How...

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.979
How is it possible?

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.790
We already passed by it.

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:58.490
This place is weird, too. Ji-hyun...

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.230
Hold on.

01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.400
What's this smell?

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.700
What?

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:13.480
Why is it here?

01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:20.920
These were at the lab!

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:24.980
Ji-hyun!

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:29.860
Ji-hyun...

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:34.730
What is wrong with you?

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.900
Ji-hyun!

01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:44.720
Ji-hyun...

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:00.690
No, don't do that!

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:02.760
Ji-hyun...

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.960
Oh my God...

01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:00.000
Captain! Captain...

01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:02.820
Where are you?

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:32.080
Ji-hyun...

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:47.820
Please help me...

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:53.270
Save me...

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.000
No! Help me! Please!

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.730
Please let me out!

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.400
Open the door!

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:26.020
Sung-hun...

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:29.230
We have to leave right now!

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:31.230
Let's go now! Fast!

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:32.560
The door is almost opened!

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.929
That doesn't matter.

01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:35.800
We shouldn't be here. We have to leave!

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.039
<i>Why?</i>

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.439
<i>Seung-wook is locked
in the room downstairs.</i>

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.540
Fuck that bastard!
We're about to reach one million!

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:46.210
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.809
We must not be here.

01:16:47.810 --> 01:16:50.580
We have to save Seung-wook
and get out of this place!

01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:53.350
- Yes, captain.
- Ah-yeon.

01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:54.950
Open the door and get in now.

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:58.290
Captain told me to open
the door and get in now.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:01.060
You two listen to me.

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:05.000
The ritual and the doll we staged them.

01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:06.130
What?

01:17:06.131 --> 01:17:07.729
We faked it for the views!

01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:10.300
But everything going
on right now is real!

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.610
That fucking moron...

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:16.840
Seung-wook might die.
We have to save him now!

01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:17.940
Is this for real?

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.810
I mean it! We're all
going to die if we stay!

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.530
If you don't do it, I'll do it myself.

01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:38.060
The ping-pong ball again!

01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:49.610
Shit! What the hell is that?

01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:57.520
What...

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:03.190
Is someone inside?

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:05.289
What's going on?

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:07.030
Everything is real.

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:09.090
<i>Please help me!</i>

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:10.730
<i>Save me!</i>

01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:13.130
Charlotte?

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:14.230
Is that you?

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:17.499
- I can't open the door!
- Let me do it. Charlotte!

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.800
- Charlotte!
- Do something! Charlotte!

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.710
What shall we do?

01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:29.810
- Charlotte!
- Charlotte!

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.380
Sung-hun!

01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:35.450
- Hey...
- Where are you going?

01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:39.690
Sung-hun! Sung-hun!

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.900
Je-yoon...

01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:57.810
- Sung-hun!
- Sung-hun!

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.980
What's going on?

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:44.860
What the fuck is this?

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.810
- Ah-yeon...
- I'm here.

01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:07.480
Where's Sung-hun?

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:09.980
Don't move.

01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:14.890
What is it under our feet?

01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:16.960
It feels like water.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:23.330
You have the light?

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:29.970
What is wrong with it?

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.010
- Why isn't it working?
- Shit.

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:40.140
Why is it echoing in here?

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.020
I guess we are...

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.460
- in room 402.
- What?

01:20:55.630 --> 01:20:57.330
You got the camcorder, right?

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.600
Give me that.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.540
What?

01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:09.840
Where are we?

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.550
There's no door here.

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:25.690
Why is there no door?

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:37.340
Water?

01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:42.010
How is it possible?

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:55.890
What's going on?

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:01.390
There's someone.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.560
Where?

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:06.629
- A girl...
- No way.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:08.130
Is looking down on us.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.500
Are we really in room 402?

01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:15.310
Je-yoon...

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:17.140
On your face! The hands!

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:23.190
You too, Ah-yeon...

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:25.360
Don't do that...

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.000
Someone's here...

01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:40.880
We have to get out of here.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:04.630
Ah-yeon... Ah-yeon!

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.680
Sung-hun...

01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:11.790
Ah-yeon...

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.320
Je-yoon!

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.830
Sung-hun!

01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:41.090
Je-yoon!

01:28:42.670 --> 01:28:44.240
Can you hear me?

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:48.110
Please help me! Where are you?

01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:52.180
Help me, please!

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.959
Save me! Sung-hun!

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:06.730
Please come help me!

01:29:07.150 --> 01:29:09.220
Anybody here?

01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:37.180
<i>It's not a live broadcast?</i>
