WEBVTT

00:03.874 --> 00:05.808
Last week on Seinfeld.

00:05.976 --> 00:07.443
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.

00:07.611 --> 00:09.476
The Tonight Show called
and they want me...

00:09.647 --> 00:12.480
...to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me tickets to L.A.

00:12.650 --> 00:14.049
- You wanna go?
- A free ticket?

00:14.218 --> 00:15.913
In fact, we could track down Kramer.

00:16.085 --> 00:19.055
I got a very big meeting. I got people
interested in my treatment.

00:19.223 --> 00:20.952
- Pretty young thing.
- She was.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.423
It's a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?

00:23.594 --> 00:26.563
Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.755
Don't look. Don't look.
It's Fred Savage.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.302
Did I frighten you?
I may look weird, but I'm just like you.

00:32.469 --> 00:35.302
I'm just a regular guy, just trying
to make it in this business.

00:35.472 --> 00:37.838
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.

00:38.208 --> 00:39.436
Just the trees.

00:39.610 --> 00:42.408
Could you not tuck the blankets in?

00:42.580 --> 00:44.571
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

00:48.752 --> 00:50.310
I think we just caught a break.

00:50.487 --> 00:53.479
All right. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

00:53.657 --> 00:58.924
So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer,
dude, you ever kill a man before?"

00:59.096 --> 01:00.961
You're on The Tonight Show. NBC.

01:01.131 --> 01:02.655
- Who else is on?
- I don't know.

01:02.833 --> 01:03.959
Corbin Bernsen.

01:04.134 --> 01:07.695
Do I have a case for you guys
to do on L.A. Law.

01:07.871 --> 01:09.805
I don't wanna tell you
how to run the show...

01:09.974 --> 01:12.602
- No, of course not.
- It's enough with the bar already.

01:12.776 --> 01:17.213
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.042
But troubled, strange.

01:19.216 --> 01:22.879
- Let's pick up this Kramer.
- Kramer!

01:23.053 --> 01:25.681
Police have just released
a photo of the suspect...

01:25.856 --> 01:28.086
...being sought in connection
with the slayings.

01:28.258 --> 01:32.058
He is known only as Kramer.

01:32.730 --> 01:34.664
There are many different jobs
in the police.

01:36.233 --> 01:38.565
It seems to me
that "chalk outline guy"...

01:38.736 --> 01:41.796
...is one of the better jobs
that you can get.

01:42.206 --> 01:45.664
You know, it's not too dangerous.
The criminals are long gone.

01:45.843 --> 01:47.401
That seems like a good one.

01:47.578 --> 01:51.014
I guess they're people that wanted
to be sketch artists...

01:51.181 --> 01:53.581
...but they couldn't draw too well.

01:53.751 --> 01:55.616
"Listen, Johnson,
forget the sketches.

01:55.786 --> 01:58.687
Do you think if we left the body
right there on the sidewalk...

01:58.856 --> 02:01.552
...you could manage to trace
around it?

02:01.725 --> 02:04.387
Could you do that?"

02:05.062 --> 02:07.053
How does that even help them
solve the crime?

02:07.231 --> 02:09.756
They look at the thing.
"His arm was like that...

02:09.933 --> 02:11.400
...when he hit the pavement.

02:11.568 --> 02:15.197
That means the killer must
have been Jim."

02:20.611 --> 02:23.637
- He's on the loose.
- Let go of my arm. You'll get us killed.

02:23.814 --> 02:26.647
What are we supposed to do?
What do you do in this situation?

02:26.817 --> 02:28.682
Should we call a lawyer
or the police?

02:28.852 --> 02:32.811
Obviously, we're gonna call the police
and tell them he's not the guy.

02:33.424 --> 02:37.383
- We hope he's not the guy.
- Couldn't be the guy.

02:39.396 --> 02:41.455
God, I'm starved.
I'm weak with hunger.

02:41.632 --> 02:44.294
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

02:44.468 --> 02:46.299
A time like what? I'm hungry.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.461
My stomach doesn't know
that Kramer's wanted.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.773
I told you, you should
have had breakfast.

02:50.941 --> 02:53.876
I couldn't have breakfast.
It was lunchtime.

02:54.044 --> 02:56.274
The three-hour time difference
threw me.

02:56.447 --> 02:59.280
I wanted a tuna fish sandwich.
They wouldn't serve me one...

02:59.450 --> 03:01.418
...because they were only
serving breakfast.

03:01.585 --> 03:05.612
- You should've had some eggs.
- For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?

03:05.789 --> 03:08.781
Have you ever heard of egg salad?

03:09.426 --> 03:10.791
Why didn't you say something?

03:10.961 --> 03:12.758
I gotta tell you about egg salad?

03:12.930 --> 03:16.832
I need food, Jerry. I'm feeling faint.
I'm getting lightheaded.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.093
I gotta call the police.
There's a pay phone.

03:19.536 --> 03:21.834
Pay phone in L.A.
Look, it's a miracle.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.074

03:30.914 --> 03:32.677
I have no change.
You got any change?

03:32.850 --> 03:34.681
No, I don't. I never carry change.

03:34.852 --> 03:37.286
- We need change. All I got is 20s.
- I have a 10.

03:37.454 --> 03:39.285
- So break it.
- I hate asking for change.

03:39.456 --> 03:42.425
They make a face. It's like I'm asking
them to donate a kidney.

03:42.593 --> 03:44.720
- So buy something.
- What?

03:44.895 --> 03:47.591
I don't know.
Some mints or Tic Tacs.

03:47.765 --> 03:50.256
- Breath problem?
- No. I just want some change.

03:50.434 --> 03:52.265
- Tell me.
- Your breath is fine.

03:52.436 --> 03:54.165
It's delightful. It's delicious.

03:54.338 --> 03:58.240
- You know, I haven't eaten anything.
- I just wanna call the police.

03:58.408 --> 04:01.138
Why don't you just call 911?

04:01.478 --> 04:03.844
- But is this an emergency?
- Of course it is.

04:04.014 --> 04:05.345
How is this an emergency?

04:05.949 --> 04:08.509
Your friend has been accused
of being a serial killer.

04:08.685 --> 04:10.152
I think that qualifies.

04:11.054 --> 04:13.818
All right, I'll call 911.

04:14.558 --> 04:17.356
Do you think he did it?
Could he have done it?

04:17.528 --> 04:19.620
He couldn't have done it.
How could he have?

04:19.797 --> 04:22.493
Couldn't do it. Could he?

04:22.666 --> 04:25.863
Hello, 911? How are you?

04:26.036 --> 04:27.765
I'm sorry. Just a reflex.

04:27.938 --> 04:31.897
I know it's an emergency number.
It is an emergency.

04:32.075 --> 04:34.566
My friend's been accused
of being the Smog Strangler...

04:34.745 --> 04:36.645
...and I know he didn't do it.

04:37.147 --> 04:39.741
They're putting me through
to the detective in charge.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.248
Making terrific headway.

04:41.418 --> 04:44.046
What is my name? Who am I?

04:44.221 --> 04:47.213
I'm George Costanza.

04:47.457 --> 04:48.981
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?

04:49.159 --> 04:51.354
- What are you using my name for?
- Don't be a baby.

04:51.528 --> 04:54.463
- What are you scared of?
- I'm scared of the same thing you are:

04:54.631 --> 04:56.997
Everything. Why don't you just
use your own name?

04:57.167 --> 05:00.364
Your name is a good name. Costanza.
Sounds like it stands for something.

05:00.537 --> 05:02.266
- They'll believe us.
- Really?

05:02.439 --> 05:03.838
- Sure.
- You think so?

05:04.007 --> 05:05.304
Oh, yeah.

05:05.475 --> 05:09.172
Yes, I have very important information
regarding the Smog Strangler.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.773
Get yourself a mint or something.

05:11.949 --> 05:13.576
Can I come in right now?

05:13.750 --> 05:15.342
I suppose.

05:15.519 --> 05:18.352
Where are you located?
Where is that?

05:18.822 --> 05:21.188
I don't know where we are.
Where are we?

05:21.358 --> 05:23.053
- I don't know
- We don't know.

05:23.227 --> 05:25.286
He says, "Ask somebody."
Ask that guy.

05:25.462 --> 05:27.396
- Excuse me, where are we?
- Earth.

05:27.698 --> 05:31.225
Hey, you know, I'm on the phone
with the police.

05:32.970 --> 05:36.235
Some guy just gave me
a wise answer.

05:37.374 --> 05:38.636
Ask that woman.

05:38.809 --> 05:40.936
- Excuse me, what street are we on?
- I don't know.

05:41.111 --> 05:42.669
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

05:42.846 --> 05:45.542
How could you not know
what street you're on?

05:45.716 --> 05:47.980
You don't know.

05:48.151 --> 05:53.714
George, it says here on the phone.
It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard.

05:54.057 --> 05:55.422
Okay.

05:55.592 --> 05:57.890
Do we know where the 101 is?
No.

05:58.061 --> 06:00.495
Do we know where the 170 is?
No.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.791
Do we know where the 134 is?

06:03.367 --> 06:04.732
No.

06:06.403 --> 06:07.927
Okay.

06:09.473 --> 06:11.839
He's gonna send a black and white
to pick us up.

06:12.009 --> 06:14.068
- Black and white?
- Cop car.

06:14.244 --> 06:17.111
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I thought it sounded cool.

06:17.281 --> 06:19.977
- Yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
- Oh, you are.

06:20.150 --> 06:22.448
I guarantee you Lupe's gonna tuck
your covers in.

06:22.619 --> 06:24.519
- I'll bet you. How much?
- Her tip.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.815
- You got a bet.
- Okay.

06:26.990 --> 06:29.220
How much do you tip
a chambermaid?

06:29.393 --> 06:31.759
Which one of you is Costanza?

06:32.095 --> 06:33.926
Get in.

06:36.266 --> 06:38.757
Hi. How are you?
Guys, listen...

06:38.936 --> 06:43.032
...do either one of you have a mint,
or a piece of gum, or something?

06:54.785 --> 06:57.754
Hey, Jerry, do me a favor.
Close your window.

06:59.289 --> 07:02.486
Hey, get out of here.

07:03.961 --> 07:07.863
- Hey, he's fooling around back here.
- Cut it out back there.

07:08.031 --> 07:09.862
- He started it.
- I did not.

07:10.033 --> 07:11.933
You guys gonna go through
some red lights?

07:12.102 --> 07:13.865
I don't think so.

07:14.037 --> 07:17.063
- But you could.
- Oh, yeah. Of course we could.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.707
We could do anything we want.

07:18.875 --> 07:21.776
We can drive on the wrong side
of the road.

07:21.945 --> 07:25.346
We do that all the time. You should
see the looks on the people's faces.

07:25.649 --> 07:27.014
Shoot people.

07:27.184 --> 07:29.516
You guys ever shot anybody?

07:30.687 --> 07:32.917
- No.
- No.

07:33.090 --> 07:35.422
- Can I flip on the siren?
- Why are you bothering them?

07:35.592 --> 07:38.390
I'm just asking.
All they have to do is say no.

07:39.863 --> 07:41.831
Yeah, go ahead.

07:43.967 --> 07:46.629
- Check it out.
- Can I try it?

07:46.803 --> 07:49.465
Yeah, go ahead. Hurry up.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.170
Scared the hell out of that guy.

07:53.610 --> 07:57.171
You know what I've never understood?
Why did they change the siren noise?

07:57.347 --> 07:59.542
When I was a kid, it was always:

08:01.051 --> 08:02.518
You know, and now it's:

08:03.754 --> 08:05.745
Why'd they do that?
Did they do some research?

08:05.922 --> 08:08.356
Did they find out "woo-woo"
is more effective than "waa"?

08:08.525 --> 08:11.119
Yeah, hey, what about those
English sirens, you know?

08:13.697 --> 08:15.426
Hey!

08:35.419 --> 08:37.352
I'm dizzy.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.984
- Nice shotgun.
- Thanks.

08:43.460 --> 08:46.361
- Clean as a whistle.
- You could eat off that shotgun.

08:46.530 --> 08:49.328
- What is that, a 12-gauge?
- Yeah.

08:49.699 --> 08:52.361
Twelve-gauge. Seems to be
the most popular gauge.

08:52.536 --> 08:55.232
- Big gauge. My favorite.
- Mine too. Love the 12-gauge.

08:55.405 --> 08:57.669
Makes the 11 -gauge look
like a cap pistol.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.809
- What do we got over there?
- What?

08:59.976 --> 09:02.968
- I don't know.
- Looks like a possible 519.

09:03.146 --> 09:05.376
- 519? What's a 519?
- Where?

09:05.549 --> 09:08.143
- You think so?
- Looks like it.

09:08.318 --> 09:12.084
- I can't believe this. A 519?
- Where? Where? I can't see.

09:12.255 --> 09:16.521
This is car 23. We have a possible
519 in progress. Over.

09:16.693 --> 09:19.025
All right. Let's pull over
and check it out.

09:19.196 --> 09:20.788
Pull over?

09:21.031 --> 09:22.293
You can't pull over.

09:22.466 --> 09:24.525
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

09:24.701 --> 09:27.932
Pull over? The lieutenant
is waiting to see us.

09:28.105 --> 09:30.869
- Hey, hey, hey. We're in a rush here!
- We have an appointment.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.305
What are you doing?

09:41.184 --> 09:42.742
Great.

09:44.454 --> 09:47.218
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm
cookies up there.

09:47.390 --> 09:50.018
- What kind?
- Milano.

09:50.193 --> 09:54.027
Cops eating Milanos?
What kind of crazy town is this?

09:54.197 --> 09:57.633
- Should I take some?
- I think that's a 519.

09:57.934 --> 09:59.458
I'm starving.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.531
- Spread them.
- Hey, they're busting this guy.

10:02.706 --> 10:04.469
They're cuffing him.

10:07.644 --> 10:10.238
I can't believe this.

10:17.154 --> 10:20.749
I can't believe that cops
still have to read...

10:20.924 --> 10:23.916
...that whole "you have the right
to remain silent" speech...

10:24.094 --> 10:25.561
...to every criminal they arrest.

10:25.729 --> 10:28.562
Is there anybody that doesn't
know that by now?

10:28.732 --> 10:31.565
Can't they go, "You're under arrest.
You ever seen a Baretta?"

10:31.735 --> 10:34.203
"Yeah." "Good. Get in the car."

10:37.874 --> 10:39.364
Hi.

10:39.543 --> 10:40.805
Hi, I'm Jerry.

10:40.977 --> 10:43.343
George. How you doing?

10:43.947 --> 10:45.380
What'd you do?

10:45.549 --> 10:47.107
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

10:47.284 --> 10:50.617
Oh, yeah, right. Me neither.
Hey, I didn't do nothing.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.888
Shut up.

10:54.124 --> 10:57.560
- Hot out.
- Brutal.

11:02.632 --> 11:04.862
What do you tip a chambermaid?

11:05.902 --> 11:08.132
I don't know. Five bucks a night.

11:08.405 --> 11:12.273
No. A dollar. Two, tops.

11:12.609 --> 11:15.703
Hey, you guys aren't cuffed.
What are you, narcs?

11:15.879 --> 11:19.007
- Narcs.
- Imagine. Us, narcs.

11:19.182 --> 11:22.811
No, no. No, actually, we're friends
of a serial killer.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.920
- Just trying to help him out.
- Really?

11:25.088 --> 11:26.555
- Yeah.
- That's very nice.

11:26.723 --> 11:29.317
- Thank you.
- Suspected serial killer.

11:29.492 --> 11:32.290
- He didn't actually do it.
- Yeah, well, we don't think.

11:32.462 --> 11:33.929
We're pretty sure.

11:35.031 --> 11:38.762
- A dollar a night?
- Yeah. That's a good tip.

11:38.935 --> 11:41.631
- That stinks.
- I read it in Ann Landers.

11:41.805 --> 11:46.742
- Ann Landers sucks!
- Hey, shut up back there.

11:46.910 --> 11:50.311
Attention, all units. Attention, all units.
All units, code three.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.471
All units in the area,
code three in progress.

11:52.649 --> 11:57.746
1648 North Las Palmas. Units require
assistance in apprehension, 702.

11:57.921 --> 11:59.946
- That's the Smog Strangler.
- Kramer.

12:00.123 --> 12:01.488
- They got him.
- Let's go.

12:17.674 --> 12:19.642
We've gotta go.
Let's see what's happening.

12:19.809 --> 12:23.006
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Oh, man.

12:27.717 --> 12:29.776
Jerry. George.

12:29.953 --> 12:34.390
You're under arrest for first-degree
murder in the death of Chelsea Lange.

12:47.037 --> 12:51.736
Why'd you do it? Why'd you do it?
People wanna know, please!

12:51.908 --> 12:54.274
- What possessed you?
- Well, I don't know.

12:54.444 --> 12:57.675
- Do you have any regrets?
- How are you?

13:05.989 --> 13:07.513
Hey!

13:08.158 --> 13:09.921
Hey!

13:11.594 --> 13:16.861
- Hey, how you doing? Jerry! George!
- We're doing fine. How are you?

13:17.033 --> 13:20.093
What? Me? Fabulous.
Just fabulous.

13:20.270 --> 13:23.068
I got a lot of auditions,
a lot of callbacks.

13:23.239 --> 13:25.366
I got a lot of interest
in my movie treatment.

13:25.542 --> 13:28.568
You know, I'm in development.
I'm developing vehicles.

13:28.745 --> 13:32.647
Man, there's a lot of energy here, man.
You know, the vibe, it's powerful.

13:32.816 --> 13:36.047
I'm just swept up in it.
Yeah, I'm a player.

13:36.219 --> 13:39.086
- You're a player?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm a player.

13:39.322 --> 13:42.120
Kramer, do you realize
what's going on here?

13:42.292 --> 13:44.226
Do you know why you're here?

13:46.029 --> 13:49.396
What, this? I'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.

13:49.632 --> 13:52.430
Hey, guess who I met today.
Fred Savage.

13:52.602 --> 13:55.036
Oh, nice kid. A really good kid.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.730
You know, we're talking about
doing a project together.

13:57.907 --> 14:01.365
Kramer, you've been arrested
as a serial killer.

14:02.445 --> 14:05.642
So? I'm innocent.

14:05.815 --> 14:09.046
I mean, you guys believe that
I'm innocent, don't you?

14:09.219 --> 14:12.052
Jerry? George?

14:12.222 --> 14:14.713
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, sure.

14:14.891 --> 14:16.882
Kramer, let's go.
Lieutenant wants to see you.

14:17.060 --> 14:20.461
Yeah, okay, yeah. All right.
Look, I'll be out of here by noon.

14:20.630 --> 14:23.326
Hey, maybe we'll have lunch
together, huh?

14:27.303 --> 14:29.897
Hey, is it all right if I talk
to them again?

14:30.073 --> 14:32.007
Yeah, okay.

14:32.675 --> 14:39.080
Help me! Oh, God, help me! Get me
out of here! George, Jerry, get me out!

14:40.517 --> 14:41.779
Get me...!

14:41.951 --> 14:44.886
I didn't kill anyone. I swear.
I swear to God!

14:45.054 --> 14:47.579
Don't you ever swear
to my God, Kramer.

14:47.857 --> 14:51.452
My God protects the innocent
and punishes evil scum like you.

14:51.628 --> 14:53.823
- Have you got that?
- You're making a big mistake.

14:53.997 --> 14:56.989
No! You made a mistake, Kramer.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.226
Sickies like you always do.

14:59.402 --> 15:02.530
The only difference is this time
you're gonna pay.

15:02.705 --> 15:04.639
Now, you might beat
the gas chamber, Kramer.

15:04.808 --> 15:06.571
But as long as I've got a breath...

15:06.743 --> 15:08.802
...you will never see the light
of day again.

15:08.978 --> 15:12.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You got
the wrong man! It wasn't me!

15:12.348 --> 15:15.044
Yeah, right. Maybe it was one
of your other personalities.

15:15.218 --> 15:18.984
What? The wise guy, the little kid,
the bellhop, the ballplayer?

15:19.155 --> 15:21.885
Maybe the door-to-door vacuum
cleaner salesman, but not you.

15:22.058 --> 15:23.992
No, you wouldn't hurt a fly.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.492
You just couldn't help yourself,
could you, Kramer?

15:26.663 --> 15:29.996
You saw a life, brimming brightly
with optimism and verve...

15:30.166 --> 15:33.067
...and you just had to snuff it out.
- Can I talk to somebody?

15:33.236 --> 15:36.228
- You're not letting me explain!
- I don't want your explanations.

15:36.606 --> 15:39.336
Sure, I bet you've got
a million of them.

15:39.943 --> 15:41.638
Maybe your mom didn't love
you enough.

15:41.811 --> 15:45.303
Maybe the teacher didn't call on you
when you had your hand raised.

15:45.482 --> 15:48.849
Maybe the pervert in the park
had a present in his pants, huh?

15:49.018 --> 15:50.713
Oh, I got another theory for you.

15:50.887 --> 15:52.218
- You're a weed.
- No.

15:52.388 --> 15:53.912
- Society's filled with them.
- No.

15:54.090 --> 15:57.082
You're choking the life out
of all the pretty flowers.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.921
You see something young and pretty...

15:59.095 --> 16:01.529
...you just got to choke
the life out of it, don't you?

16:01.698 --> 16:04.360
You killed the pretty flowers,
didn't you, Kramer?

16:04.534 --> 16:06.866
You killed the pretty little flowers,
didn't you?

16:07.036 --> 16:10.904
You dirty, filthy, stinking weed!
Didn't you?

16:11.074 --> 16:12.439
I...

16:14.577 --> 16:17.808
Lieutenant, for you.

16:17.981 --> 16:21.144
Martel. Yeah.

16:21.317 --> 16:22.909
Yeah.

16:23.553 --> 16:25.020
Yeah.

16:25.555 --> 16:27.284
Yeah.

16:27.457 --> 16:30.392
- What is it, lieutenant?
- Let him go.

16:30.560 --> 16:33.051
- What? But, lieutenant...
- You heard me. Let him go.

16:33.229 --> 16:34.457
Get him out of here.

16:34.631 --> 16:37.566
They just found another body
up in Laurel Canyon.

16:37.734 --> 16:39.827
Go on, Kramer. Get out of my sight.

16:40.003 --> 16:41.834
How'd you know about
the guy in the park?

16:42.005 --> 16:43.529
I said, beat it.

16:51.781 --> 16:53.476
- What happened?
- Somebody got killed...

16:53.650 --> 16:55.641
...while they had me in custody.
- Really?

16:55.818 --> 16:57.410
Hear that?
Somebody else was killed.

16:57.587 --> 16:59.578
No kidding!
Somebody else got killed?

16:59.756 --> 17:02.224
While he was in jail.
So you're free!

17:02.392 --> 17:07.420
Yes, I'm free because the murderer
struck again. Hey!

17:11.634 --> 17:13.761
So, Kramer, what are you gonna do?

17:13.936 --> 17:16.565
Do? Do?

17:16.739 --> 17:19.070
Hey, I'm doing what I do.

17:19.509 --> 17:21.670
You know, I've always done what I do.

17:21.844 --> 17:23.675
I'm doing what I do.

17:23.846 --> 17:27.680
The way I've always done it,
and the way I'll always do it.

17:27.983 --> 17:29.918
Kramer, what the hell
are you talking about?

17:30.186 --> 17:31.619
Well, what do you
want me to say?

17:31.788 --> 17:34.086
That things haven't worked out
the way I've planned?

17:34.257 --> 17:37.488
That I'm struggling, barely able
to keep my head above water?

17:37.660 --> 17:40.254
That L.A.'s a cold place
even in the middle of summer.

17:40.430 --> 17:44.389
That it's a lonely place even when
you're stuck in traffic on the freeway?

17:44.567 --> 17:47.434
That I'm no better than
the screenwriter driving a cab...

17:47.604 --> 17:50.971
...the starlet turning tricks, the
producer in a house he can't afford?

17:51.207 --> 17:53.767
Is that what you want me to say?

17:54.377 --> 17:55.810
- I'd like to hear that.
- Yeah.

17:55.979 --> 17:58.413
Well, I'm not saying that.

17:58.581 --> 18:01.345
You know, things are going
pretty well for me here.

18:01.517 --> 18:04.486
- I met a girl.
- Kramer, she was murdered.

18:04.654 --> 18:08.784
Yeah, well, you know, I wasn't looking
for a long-term relationship.

18:08.958 --> 18:12.018
- I was on TV.
- As a suspect in a serial killing.

18:12.195 --> 18:15.995
Okay, yeah, all right. You guys gotta
put a negative spin on everything.

18:16.165 --> 18:19.566
What do they put in this tuna?
Tastes like a dill. I think it's a dill.

18:19.736 --> 18:23.536
- So you're not coming back with us?
- No, I'm not ready, you know.

18:23.706 --> 18:26.106
I mean, things are starting
to happen for me.

18:26.275 --> 18:28.539
Taste this. Is this a dill?

18:31.314 --> 18:32.975
No, it's a tarragon.

18:33.149 --> 18:36.175
Listen, Kramer, I'm sorry
about that whole fight we had...

18:36.352 --> 18:39.219
...about you having my apartment keys
and everything.

18:40.690 --> 18:42.681
All right.

18:42.859 --> 18:44.349
Okay, it's forgotten.

18:44.527 --> 18:46.222
- Tarragon?
- Yeah.

18:46.562 --> 18:48.496
Oh, you're crazy.

18:48.665 --> 18:50.462
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Yeah, okay.

18:50.633 --> 18:52.931
Yep, take care. Stay in touch.

18:53.102 --> 18:56.594
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, give me a hug, you guys.

18:56.773 --> 18:59.936
Kramer, my sandwich.
You're crushing my sandwich.

19:31.641 --> 19:36.044
You know, it's so nice
when it happens good.

19:52.595 --> 19:55.587
- Mint?
- No, thanks.

19:56.365 --> 19:58.959
I gotta tell you.
I'm really disappointed in Lupe.

19:59.302 --> 20:02.066
It's been three days already.
Forget about Lupe.

20:02.972 --> 20:05.668
Think she gets to take any of those
little bars of soap home?

20:05.842 --> 20:07.139
No, I don't.

20:08.377 --> 20:11.778
You'd think when they hand out the
checks, they'd throw in a few soaps.

20:11.948 --> 20:15.042
Yeah, maybe they should throw
in a couple of lamps too.

20:15.218 --> 20:19.018
I'll tell you, if I owned a company,
my employees would love me.

20:19.188 --> 20:22.055
They'd have huge pictures of me
on the walls and in their home.

20:22.225 --> 20:24.125
Like Lenin.

20:24.293 --> 20:26.921
How much did you wind up
tipping her?

20:27.096 --> 20:30.293
Oh, my God, I forgot.

20:30.466 --> 20:32.627
That's why communism didn't work.

20:34.337 --> 20:36.032
Hey!

20:43.246 --> 20:46.272
- Got any mustard? This is empty.
- Yeah, there's a new one in there.

20:46.449 --> 20:48.883
No, no. I don't like this one.
It's too yellow.

20:49.519 --> 20:51.077
- Did you know he was back?
- No.

20:51.254 --> 20:53.722
- Got any pickles?
- Help yourself.

20:53.890 --> 20:56.552
Yeah. All right.

20:56.926 --> 20:59.895
Kramer, what are you doing here?

21:00.429 --> 21:02.260
I'm getting something to eat.

21:02.431 --> 21:03.921
Kramer.

21:05.034 --> 21:06.524
Here.

21:18.514 --> 21:21.677
Authorities disclosed today that
the latest Smog Stranglings suspect...

21:23.186 --> 21:25.586
...was apprehended this week
on an unrelated charge...

21:25.755 --> 21:27.518
...but somehow managed to escape...

21:27.690 --> 21:30.625
...from the police car
in which he was being held.

21:30.793 --> 21:34.229
Tobias Lehigh Nagy,
who is also wanted...

21:34.397 --> 21:37.457
...in connection with unrelated
slayings in the Northwest...

21:37.633 --> 21:40.966
...is still at large,
his whereabouts unknown.

21:41.137 --> 21:44.334
He is described as 5'5", bald...

21:44.507 --> 21:48.204
...and reputedly
a very generous tipper.

21:48.411 --> 21:51.346
The thing about L.A. to me
that kind of threw me...

21:51.514 --> 21:54.210
...was when, you know, they have
the smog alerts out there.

21:54.383 --> 21:58.877
And they actually recommend
that people stay indoors...

21:59.055 --> 22:04.049
...during the smog alert.
Now, maybe I'm way off...

22:04.393 --> 22:05.883
...but don't you think...?

22:06.062 --> 22:08.860
Wouldn't you assume that the air
in the house...

22:09.031 --> 22:14.094
...pretty much comes from the air
in the city where the house is?

22:15.071 --> 22:16.766
What do they think?
We live in a jar...

22:16.939 --> 22:19.134
...with a couple of holes
punched in the top?

22:19.308 --> 22:21.708
What the hell's going on out there?
It's very strange.

22:21.878 --> 22:25.211
Do you realize it is now possible
for parents to say to their children:

22:25.381 --> 22:29.147
"All right, kids, I want you in the house
and get some fresh air.

22:29.318 --> 22:32.810
Summer vacation.
Everybody indoors."
