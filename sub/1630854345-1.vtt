- I won't. I promise.

10:00.998 --> 10:01.932
- Good.

10:16.814 --> 10:19.049
- Be careful when loading these.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.684
You break it, you bought it.

10:20.718 --> 10:21.719
- I don't work here.

10:21.752 --> 10:24.154
- Ah, OK.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.323
I don't think I get your costume then.

10:26.357 --> 10:27.925
- Oh, pirate.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.426
You thought I was a porter?

10:29.460 --> 10:31.395
With a feather in my hat?

10:31.428 --> 10:32.830
- All apologies.

10:32.863 --> 10:34.798
If I could make myself disappear, I would.

10:34.832 --> 10:36.000
Oh, wait a minute...

10:38.035 --> 10:39.003
I can.

10:55.953 --> 10:58.322
- All right, so, a proctologist pulls a thermometer

10:58.355 --> 10:59.456
out of his coat pocket.

10:59.490 --> 11:02.226
Then he says: "Great, now some asshole has my pen."

11:02.259 --> 11:04.762
- Pet, can you do something about your boyfriend?

11:04.795 --> 11:08.799
- Mmm, I tried to get him to leave this thing at the frat.

11:08.832 --> 11:10.234
But he wouldn't listen to me.

11:10.267 --> 11:11.735
- You philistines don't value art!

11:11.769 --> 11:12.970
When I'm rich and famous,

11:13.003 --> 11:14.738
Simone and I will remember this outrage

11:14.772 --> 11:17.241
and shower you with our disdain.

11:17.274 --> 11:18.942
- All right, for all our sake,

11:18.976 --> 11:20.944
I'm taking her away from you, permanently.

11:20.978 --> 11:21.945
Boop! - My muse!

11:21.979 --> 11:23.747
Kidnapped by a heathen!

11:23.781 --> 11:26.116
Jackson! I'm gonna report you to the SVU

11:26.150 --> 11:27.751
if you don't give my baby back!

11:27.785 --> 11:28.719
Come on!

11:32.156 --> 11:33.757
- All right, let's go!

11:33.791 --> 11:35.059
(Crowd talking, indistinct)

11:35.092 --> 11:36.360
- All aboard!

11:38.829 --> 11:40.531
Hey, uh, all aboard,

11:40.564 --> 11:43.901
unless you want to spend Halloween in a train station.

11:45.569 --> 11:46.937
(Whispering): Hey. - Hey.

11:48.472 --> 11:51.175
I think you should be a little more assertive,

11:51.208 --> 11:52.810
like, alpha-doggy style.

11:52.843 --> 11:54.178
You know what I mean?

11:54.211 --> 11:55.479
Um, dominate those bitches.

11:55.512 --> 11:57.314
- Yeah, I--I think I got it. Thanks.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.216
- No, I don't think you do. Check this out.

11:59.249 --> 12:02.219
Yo, assholes!

12:02.252 --> 12:03.287
There we go.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.555
Hey, my friend here has got

12:04.588 --> 12:06.857
something really important to say.

12:06.890 --> 12:10.360
So, just--just shut the fuck up and listen to her, OK?

12:10.394 --> 12:13.964
- OK, everyone, it's time to get this party started!

12:13.997 --> 12:15.899
(Crowd cheering)

12:15.933 --> 12:17.968
So, uh, ahem, sorry.

12:18.001 --> 12:19.837
Have your tickets ready to be scanned,

12:19.870 --> 12:21.972
and you can board using any of the doors.

12:22.005 --> 12:23.107
And have fun!

12:23.140 --> 12:24.842
(Crowd cheering)

12:24.875 --> 12:26.577
- Hey, that wasn't so bad, was it?

12:26.610 --> 12:27.544
- No, it wasn't. Thanks.

12:27.578 --> 12:28.912
- Yeah.

12:28.946 --> 12:30.447
- You can board behind me, if you like.

12:30.481 --> 12:32.149
- Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

12:32.182 --> 12:34.451
- Look, I just want to attend to my guests.

12:34.485 --> 12:36.053
- Yeah, that's all I'm asking,

12:36.086 --> 12:37.421
for you to treat me like a guest.

12:37.454 --> 12:39.590
- How about you treat her like a human being

12:39.623 --> 12:42.359
and not a piece of meat and let her do her job?

12:45.896 --> 12:47.331
What did you think she would do,

12:47.364 --> 12:48.999
fuck you after you humiliated her?

12:49.032 --> 12:51.034
- Come on, do you ever have any actual fun?

12:51.068 --> 12:52.870
- One day, you're gonna take it too far.

12:52.903 --> 12:53.937
(Gasping)

12:53.971 --> 12:55.472
Oh, wait, you already have.

12:55.506 --> 12:58.242
- Forgive me, Lord, for I have sinned.

12:59.409 --> 13:01.445
Hey, yo, party's over there, buddy.

13:01.478 --> 13:03.447
- Yeah, let's do this!

13:03.480 --> 13:05.215
Oh, uh, hey...

13:06.283 --> 13:08.285
(Laughing)

13:08.318 --> 13:10.821
I owe you. I love you.

13:12.890 --> 13:13.924
- Let's go, Mitchy.

13:13.957 --> 13:14.958
- Whoo!

13:14.992 --> 13:15.993
(Both giggling)

13:17.127 --> 13:18.629
- Oh, shit! Fucking weirdo!

13:18.662 --> 13:20.130
Ha ha! Ah!

13:20.164 --> 13:21.932
(Panting, laughing)

13:23.066 --> 13:24.935
- You've had your fun and games.

13:24.968 --> 13:26.970
Now give me Simone back!

13:27.004 --> 13:28.405
I know she's a little frigid,

13:28.438 --> 13:30.340
but it's too cold for her out here!

13:30.374 --> 13:32.142
- Oh, what's that, Simone?

13:32.176 --> 13:34.111
Simone says you're fucking weird, bro!

13:35.179 --> 13:36.346
Whoo!

13:36.380 --> 13:37.881
(Grunting)

13:39.449 --> 13:41.385
(Sighing)

13:43.554 --> 13:45.055
(Groaning)

13:47.090 --> 13:49.293
- I know shoes make the outfit,

13:49.326 --> 13:52.062
but this witch is gonna turn into a major bitch

13:52.095 --> 13:54.498
if she wears stilettos all night.

13:54.531 --> 13:56.099
So, ta-da!

13:56.133 --> 13:57.301
(Gasping)

13:57.334 --> 13:58.302
- Ooh, perfect! OK...

14:00.637 --> 14:05.142
So, hat, no hat?

14:06.243 --> 14:07.544
Jacket and hat?

14:07.578 --> 14:08.579
Or both of them?

14:08.612 --> 14:10.380
You know what I am, right?

14:10.414 --> 14:12.950
- Yeah, yeah, you're one of the Three Musketeers.

14:14.051 --> 14:15.953
- A musketeer? Ugh!

14:15.986 --> 14:17.654
I knew I should have worn an eye patch!

14:17.688 --> 14:21.058
I'm supposed to be a pirate, a sexy pirate.

14:21.091 --> 14:22.960
- A pirate? Oh, no.

14:22.993 --> 14:25.195
No, you are missing more than an eye patch, babe.

14:25.229 --> 14:27.364
No, you need to say, "Arr!"

14:27.397 --> 14:30.167
You need a parrot, a peg-leg, a skull and crossbones.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.935
- Oh, I do have that.

14:33.003 --> 14:33.971
- God.

14:34.004 --> 14:35.105
(Laughing)

14:35.138 --> 14:36.106
- Hello! - No!

14:36.139 --> 14:38.976
No! Go! - Ah...

14:39.009 --> 14:40.944
(Grunting)

14:43.480 --> 14:45.282
- Hey, killer costume, Ed!

14:45.315 --> 14:47.251
(Grunting)

14:53.523 --> 14:56.660
Yeah, but work on those acting skills next time.

14:56.693 --> 14:58.362
(Grunting)

15:00.731 --> 15:02.699
(Moaning)

15:02.733 --> 15:04.301
(Grunting)

15:04.334 --> 15:05.502
(Imitating motor boat)

15:05.535 --> 15:07.471
- Can you put it on me, please?

15:07.504 --> 15:08.605
- Yeah. - Thank you.

15:12.542 --> 15:13.677
Thank you.

15:15.212 --> 15:16.680
What? - Nothing.

15:16.713 --> 15:19.583
It's just... It feels like we just met.

15:19.616 --> 15:21.618
And soon, you'll be going off to med school.

15:21.652 --> 15:23.153
Four years went by way too fast!

15:23.186 --> 15:25.122
- Well, it was 3 years for me.

15:25.155 --> 15:26.657
- Oh my God, you're such an ice queen.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.458
- I'm gonna miss you so much!

15:28.492 --> 15:30.360
I don't even know what to think about it.

15:30.394 --> 15:32.062
- Oh, me neither. - I love you.

15:32.095 --> 15:34.131
And no matter what, we are best friends for life.

15:34.164 --> 15:36.600
- Even if I marry Doc one day?

15:36.633 --> 15:39.069
- Even if you lose your mind and marry Doc.

15:39.102 --> 15:40.270
(Giggling)

15:48.245 --> 15:49.246
(Alana): OK.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.681
I'm gonna go find Mo.

15:50.714 --> 15:52.316
- Mmm. - Are you OK with all this?

15:52.349 --> 15:54.017
- Yeah, yeah, no problem. Ooh!

15:54.051 --> 15:57.454
Get me a gin and tonic. Oh, mmm, no, no.

15:57.487 --> 16:00.123
No, make it a double tequila-soda.

16:00.157 --> 16:01.124
- OK, you got it.

16:01.158 --> 16:02.092
(Giggling)

16:16.473 --> 16:19.242
- Everybody's boarded. Let's get on our way.

16:22.145 --> 16:24.081
(Train whistling)

16:42.599 --> 16:43.767
- Hey, Ed.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.802
Shouldn't you be with Pet and Sandy?

16:45.836 --> 16:47.070
Simone?

16:47.104 --> 16:48.438
Whatever the hell you call her?

16:49.639 --> 16:52.175
OK, and now you're just being weird.

16:53.410 --> 16:56.513
Ooh, I'm so scared of a rubber knife.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.518
If you want a drink, it's this way.

17:01.551 --> 17:04.654
- Girl! Let me in! Whoa!

17:04.688 --> 17:06.690
(Woman laughing)

17:15.465 --> 17:17.401
♪ ♪

17:22.873 --> 17:24.541
- You haven't seen Ed, have you?

17:24.574 --> 17:26.410
- I just ran into him.

17:26.443 --> 17:28.345
He's walking around trying to scare people.

17:28.378 --> 17:29.346
(Giggling)

17:29.379 --> 17:31.148
- Of course he is.

17:31.181 --> 17:33.583
You're so lucky you have a normal boyfriend like Mo.

17:33.617 --> 17:34.885
(Chuckling)

17:34.918 --> 17:36.219
- You try calling Ed?

17:36.253 --> 17:37.287
- No coverage,

17:37.320 --> 17:39.723
because we're in the middle of who-knows-where.

17:39.756 --> 17:41.158
This Wi-Fi is a fucking joke.

17:41.191 --> 17:42.159
(Scoffing)

17:42.192 --> 17:43.293
So basic.

17:43.326 --> 17:44.895
Anyway...

17:44.928 --> 17:46.463
(Pet giggling)

17:48.298 --> 17:49.833
- Here, I should take a couple too.

(Giggling)

17:54.204 --> 17:55.806
(Gasping)

17:55.839 --> 17:59.176
- You know, I did hear something about some bullshit VIP room.

17:59.209 --> 18:01.445
Ed might be heading that way.

18:01.478 --> 18:03.246
- Cool, thanks!

18:03.280 --> 18:04.714
(♪ Electronic on PA )

18:04.748 --> 18:06.616
(Men and woman talking, laughing)

18:06.650 --> 18:09.453
- An old fashioned and a double tequila-soda, please.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.588
- It's on me.

18:11.621 --> 18:12.622
(Chuckling)

18:12.656 --> 18:13.857
- It's an open bar.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.492
- Damn.

18:15.525 --> 18:17.928
Here I thought I could make up for my faux pas earlier.

18:17.961 --> 18:20.530
- Your "faux pas," huh? Fancy!

18:20.564 --> 18:22.566
- Well, I'm a fancy guy. I wear a cape.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.336
Anyway, um, apologies.

18:26.369 --> 18:27.737
- It's OK.

18:27.771 --> 18:30.574
I mean, my pirate costume is clearly a big fail anyways.

18:30.607 --> 18:32.909
- Well, I don't think it's the outfit.

18:32.943 --> 18:36.246
- So, what, you see me and you think "train porter"?

18:36.279 --> 18:39.316
- Well, I don't think "sorority sister".

18:39.349 --> 18:42.185
You don't strike me as the type of person to ask people

18:42.219 --> 18:43.553
to let you join their squad.

18:43.587 --> 18:44.788
- "Join their squad."

18:44.821 --> 18:46.323
I think I liked it better

18:46.356 --> 18:47.791
when you were speaking fancy French.

18:47.824 --> 18:49.759
Thanks!

18:49.793 --> 18:52.395
Hey, how'd you do that little trick earlier,

18:52.429 --> 18:53.930
where you disappeared into thin air?

18:55.565 --> 18:58.702
- Well, if I told you, I'd have to kill you.

19:00.003 --> 19:01.304
(Chuckling)

19:15.819 --> 19:16.820
- Ah!

19:16.853 --> 19:18.255

19:18.288 --> 19:19.556

19:26.863 --> 19:28.665
(Alana laughing)

19:28.698 --> 19:29.933

19:50.954 --> 19:52.822
Oh my God!

19:54.057 --> 19:55.692

19:55.725 --> 19:58.395
Now you and I can be together forever.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.631

20:06.469 --> 20:08.038
You assholes!

20:08.071 --> 20:09.973
- Been called worse by you!

20:10.006 --> 20:12.609
- You gotta admit it, pretty convincing.

20:12.642 --> 20:14.778
- OK, it's very convincing!

20:20.984 --> 20:23.620
Well played, both of you.

20:23.653 --> 20:26.356

20:26.389 --> 20:27.724
Please, say that one more time,

20:27.757 --> 20:30.460
'cause I need to record it for posterity!

20:30.493 --> 20:32.395
- Not on social media, didn't happen.

20:32.429 --> 20:35.498
But you should delete that video of me while you're at it.

20:35.532 --> 20:36.833
- Why would I ever do that?

20:36.866 --> 20:38.802

20:38.835 --> 20:40.437
- Well, unlike with Kenny,

20:40.470 --> 20:42.606
this won't send you into a straight jacket.

20:42.639 --> 20:46.543
- Still, frat-sanctioned party, dead-body freak-out...

20:47.777 --> 20:50.981
- The Prez can pry this from my dead, cold hands.

20:51.014 --> 20:53.316
Enjoy your cock -tails.

you might want to try harder.

OK, I know we're not supposed to light up in here,

but rules are made to be broken.

21:28.752 --> 21:29.919
Hmm! Whoops.

21:31.087 --> 21:33.490
Do you want one? Doc rolled way too many.

(Chuckling)

21:38.695 --> 21:40.697
OK, now you're just being annoying!

21:40.730 --> 21:43.033
When I find Pet, who's way out of your league,

21:43.066 --> 21:44.901
I'm gonna tell her she could do way better.

You're totally whack tonight, bro.

If we did that, would that make us gay?

23:08.218 --> 23:10.754
Or would you just be, like, hardcore into bestiality?

32:00.650 --> 32:03.085
Well, sororities give you a leg-up,

32:03.119 --> 32:05.288
which someone who's poor,

32:05.321 --> 32:08.391
but not poor enough for a scholarship needs in life.

32:08.424 --> 32:10.559
Plus, those people out there

32:10.593 --> 32:12.695
don't make me explain myself to them.

32:12.728 --> 32:15.564
- No offence, I just think you belong to a better crowd,

32:15.598 --> 32:17.633
instead of Doc and that wet-blanket beta of his.

32:17.667 --> 32:19.135
(Scoffing)

32:19.168 --> 32:21.470
- Mo's my boyfriend. And he's no wet blanket.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.572
- Whoops.

32:23.606 --> 32:27.009
Still, a good ol' train crash would rid the world

32:27.043 --> 32:29.512
of a bunch of self-obsessed, privileged assholes.

32:29.545 --> 32:32.214
- That's fucked up, man.

33:15.324 --> 33:17.093
- All I can think about is

33:17.126 --> 33:19.095
our boyfriends dogging those young pledges.

33:19.128 --> 33:21.330
- And what is stopping you from doing the same?

33:21.364 --> 33:22.565
The monogamy myth is a trap.

43:22.931 --> 43:24.800
That would mess anyone up.

43:24.833 --> 43:27.369
But of course, they don't think about that,

43:27.402 --> 43:29.137

But targeting innocent people is crossing the line.

43:42.117 --> 43:43.986

43:44.019 --> 43:46.021
- The fake dead body she found in the bathroom

43:47.255 --> 43:49.291

- Your ways of doing things are done, Doc!

44:04.740 --> 44:06.008
- And--and here we go again.

44:06.041 --> 44:07.743
You know, if I said half the shit

44:07.776 --> 44:10.178
that you say about me about women, I'd be cancelled.

44:10.212 --> 44:12.280
My balls would be strung up in town square.

44:12.314 --> 44:14.916
But you get to spout off whatever garbage you want.

44:14.950 --> 44:16.818
- It's not just me. Look around!

44:16.852 --> 44:19.488
Everyone is tired of your shit!

44:19.521 --> 44:22.457
They tolerate you, but nobody actually likes you!

44:22.491 --> 44:24.960
- Well, you should worry a little less about me.

44:24.993 --> 44:27.062
Maybe, just maybe, worry a little more about Mo,

44:27.095 --> 44:30.799
'cause if anybody is tolerating anybody, it's him!

44:30.832 --> 44:33.035
- Oh, you don't know the first thing about us.

44:33.068 --> 44:35.070
- I know that the poor guy's hiding in a VIP room

44:35.103 --> 44:36.271
drinking himself half-blind

44:36.304 --> 44:38.073
wondering if he needs an escape plan

44:38.106 --> 44:39.207
from your relationship.

44:39.241 --> 44:41.109
- If he is, it's because of you.

44:42.144 --> 44:44.079
- Hey, Alana!

44:44.112 --> 44:45.213
- What?

44:46.448 --> 44:48.250
- The future is female.

44:48.283 --> 44:49.384
- Fuck you!

44:50.519 --> 44:52.487
- Mo's in the VIP room with Pet.

44:52.521 --> 44:54.456
And she's got the major hots for him.

44:54.489 --> 44:55.857

Mm-mmm.

47:25.273 --> 47:26.875

54:44.445 --> 54:45.780
- I didn't see anything!

54:45.813 --> 54:47.415
One moment he's fine, the next...

54:47.448 --> 54:48.783
- I'm gonna call Carne.

54:48.816 --> 54:50.385
- I think he struck an artery!

54:50.418 --> 54:51.519
Oh, Mo, Mo! - What can we do?

54:51.552 --> 54:52.587
Fuck! What can we do?

54:52.620 --> 54:53.921
- Mo, stay with me. Please, Mo.

54:53.955 --> 54:56.557
- Your friend needs medical help.

54:56.591 --> 54:59.560
Carne, crank this train as fast as you can!

54:59.594 --> 55:01.629
(Sobbing)

55:01.663 --> 55:03.631
- Mo, Mo! Stay with me, baby!

55:03.665 --> 55:05.833
Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo!

55:05.867 --> 55:07.635
Mo, stay-- Mo!

55:07.669 --> 55:09.370
(Mo gasping, grunting)

55:09.404 --> 55:10.672
Mo!

55:10.705 --> 55:12.640
(Sobbing)

55:14.042 --> 55:16.010
Who the fuck is doing this to us?

55:22.050 --> 55:23.951
(Screaming, sobbing)

55:28.756 --> 55:31.693
(Train whistling)

55:34.028 --> 55:36.531
(Alana crying)

55:36.564 --> 55:38.032
- Mitchy, we need to find her.

55:38.066 --> 55:39.701
- Come on. - No, Doc.

55:39.734 --> 55:41.102
- We need to find Mitchy. - Doc...

55:41.135 --> 55:42.870
- She's in danger too. - She's dead.

55:42.904 --> 55:44.739
- (Whispering): Don't fuck with me, OK?

55:44.772 --> 55:46.074
- I wouldn't. She's...

55:46.107 --> 55:47.608
She's...

55:47.642 --> 55:51.112
- No, no, no, no! Fuck!

55:51.145 --> 55:53.081
(Breathing heavily)

55:53.114 --> 55:55.083
We're next.

55:56.651 --> 55:57.719
We're fucking next.

55:57.752 --> 55:58.953
It's you and me.

56:01.723 --> 56:03.458
(Brakes screeching, people screaming)

56:07.528 --> 56:09.797
- Dude, what the hell are you doing?

56:09.831 --> 56:11.065
People went flying!

56:11.099 --> 56:12.800
- Shut the fuck up!

56:12.834 --> 56:14.202
- I am done with your bullshit.

56:14.235 --> 56:16.504
I won that election fair and square.

56:16.537 --> 56:17.705
- No... - No, let me finish.

56:17.739 --> 56:21.676
You don't like me or how I'm trying to change this frat.

56:21.709 --> 56:23.044
A fraternity you almost destroy--

56:23.077 --> 56:24.479
(Grunting)

56:24.512 --> 56:25.813
- (Woman): Oh my God!

56:25.847 --> 56:27.548
- Open your eyes, bro.

56:27.582 --> 56:29.584
- No, no, this is a prank.

56:29.617 --> 56:31.219
You've gone too far this time.

56:31.252 --> 56:32.954
- It's not a prank.

56:32.987 --> 56:34.555
This is really happening to us.

56:43.631 --> 56:45.533
(Crowd chatting, indistinct)

56:48.002 --> 56:49.637
- OK, we're gonna do a headcount.

56:49.670 --> 56:51.205
And then we'll get on the go in ten.

56:51.239 --> 56:52.774
(Sighing)

56:52.807 --> 56:55.176
I told Jim to keep the, uh, engine-room door locked

56:55.209 --> 56:56.911
until we pull into the station.

56:56.944 --> 56:58.146
OK, everyone.

56:58.179 --> 57:00.548
Everyone, please listen up.

57:00.581 --> 57:02.817
Everyone, please, I need your attention.

57:02.850 --> 57:04.051
Listen, everyone?

57:04.085 --> 57:05.953
- Shut the hell up!

57:09.123 --> 57:11.526
- OK, I get it. You're scared.

57:11.559 --> 57:13.127
So am I!

57:13.161 --> 57:14.695
But there's safety in numbers.

57:14.729 --> 57:15.930
- Tell Mo that.

57:15.963 --> 57:18.232
- W-while we're still all in here,

57:18.266 --> 57:22.236
we're safe as long as we stick together.

57:22.270 --> 57:26.207
The train's going to be starting again in a few minutes.

57:26.240 --> 57:27.809
But before then,

57:27.842 --> 57:31.179
my crew and I are gonna sweep through all the cars,

57:31.212 --> 57:34.515
right from the engine room to the last car,

57:34.549 --> 57:36.784
make sure there's nobody hiding out

57:36.818 --> 57:39.187
and that we're all accounted for, OK?

57:39.220 --> 57:43.791
But first, anyone who's wearing a mask,

57:43.825 --> 57:45.693
would you please remove it?

57:46.928 --> 57:48.996
OK, take a look around.

57:49.030 --> 57:52.767
Now, is there anybody you don't recognize?

57:52.800 --> 57:54.035
- No. - Uh...

57:54.068 --> 57:55.870
- (Carne): No? - No.

57:55.903 --> 57:57.805
- I don't see Jackson and I don't see Ed.

57:57.839 --> 57:58.940
- (Man): Wait, is...

57:58.973 --> 58:02.276
- OK, but we're still gonna have to get a headcount

58:02.310 --> 58:04.579
just to find out if there's anybody missing.

58:04.612 --> 58:07.114
- Missing?

58:07.148 --> 58:09.283
Do you mean more people have been murdered?

58:09.317 --> 58:11.052
Not just Mo and Mitchy?

58:11.085 --> 58:12.987
- Wait, what? - No. No, no, no!

58:13.020 --> 58:15.022
I mean your friends could be out there drunk.

58:15.056 --> 58:17.158
Or--or afraid

58:17.191 --> 58:21.162
or doing whatever their libido is telling them to do right now.

58:21.195 --> 58:24.298
In the meantime, we need to get an accurate headcount.

58:24.332 --> 58:28.669
So, please, stay seated or standing as you are

58:28.703 --> 58:31.973
so that my colleague here can get an accurate count, OK?

58:32.006 --> 58:33.074
All right, thank you.

58:33.107 --> 58:36.244
- We're being targeted for what we did that night.

58:36.277 --> 58:37.712
- It was a goddamn prank.

58:37.745 --> 58:39.180
- That drove Kenny insane.

58:39.213 --> 58:41.282
And now, we're paying the price.

58:41.315 --> 58:42.750
(Inhaling deeply)

58:42.783 --> 58:44.652
- We're not staying here. OK?

58:44.685 --> 58:47.588
It wasn't safe for Mo, it's not gonna be safe for us.

58:47.622 --> 58:49.257
Let's go. - Let go of me.

58:55.730 --> 58:57.632
(Breathing heavily)

58:58.933 --> 59:00.935
- Gotta keep an eye on those doors.

59:00.968 --> 59:02.236
No one comes in.

59:02.270 --> 59:03.604
We sure as hell don't go out.

59:04.839 --> 59:06.173
(Lock clicking)

59:06.207 --> 59:07.842
The train makes it back to the station,

59:07.875 --> 59:08.776
and we're safe, OK?

59:09.877 --> 59:11.178
This is how we stay alive.

59:11.212 --> 59:13.114
(Breathing heavily)

59:13.147 --> 59:14.248
OK?

59:37.705 --> 59:39.840
(Breathing heavily)

59:41.108 --> 59:42.243
- Ah!

59:43.277 --> 59:45.279
(Sighing)

59:45.313 --> 59:47.348
Jesus Christ!

59:47.381 --> 59:48.816
(Scoffing)

59:48.849 --> 59:49.984
Assholes.

59:51.018 --> 59:53.154
- Nobody knows that we were behind that prank.

59:53.187 --> 59:54.822
I think you're mixing up,

59:54.855 --> 59:56.424
"We didn't tell anyone we did it,"

59:56.457 --> 59:59.293
with, "A lot of people have a pretty good idea it was us."

1:00:00.361 --> 1:00:02.063
- OK, fine.

1:00:02.096 --> 1:00:04.131
Say it was one of those losers out there.

1:00:05.199 --> 1:00:06.934
Who?

1:00:06.968 --> 1:00:08.936
And why? And why now?

1:00:08.970 --> 1:00:10.271
'Cause Kenny was 3 years ago.

1:00:10.304 --> 1:00:11.973
(Sniffling)

1:00:12.006 --> 1:00:13.174
- They were waiting...

1:00:14.475 --> 1:00:16.143
...to get us all together.

1:00:17.411 --> 1:00:19.847
Somewhere we wouldn't be able to run for any help.

1:00:29.023 --> 1:00:30.925
- Our new president?

1:00:32.193 --> 1:00:34.762
- I mean, I can understand him wanting to kill you.

1:00:34.795 --> 1:00:35.930
But the rest of us?

1:00:35.963 --> 1:00:38.165
- What if it was Ed?

1:00:38.199 --> 1:00:40.868
Last time I saw him was at the train station.

1:00:42.737 --> 1:00:44.805
- Maybe he never made it on the train.

1:00:44.839 --> 1:00:46.874
- But his costume did.

1:00:48.175 --> 1:00:49.210
Fuck.

1:00:57.785 --> 1:00:58.819
- The magician.

1:01:00.021 --> 1:01:02.156
- Yeah, boring us to death wasn't enough.

1:01:02.189 --> 1:01:03.391
- He's a weird guy,

1:01:03.424 --> 1:01:05.259
gave off a strange vibe the moment we met.

1:01:05.292 --> 1:01:07.428
- He waved knives in front of my face.

1:01:07.461 --> 1:01:10.865
- Kenny, wasn't Kenny into magic or something?

1:01:10.898 --> 1:01:14.335
- What? This is some weird revenge-magic pact?

1:01:14.368 --> 1:01:15.970
- Well, what else do we have?

1:01:16.003 --> 1:01:17.805
This guy, he caught me alone.

1:01:17.838 --> 1:01:20.141
He said horrible things about you and Mo and the frat

1:01:20.174 --> 1:01:22.209
and how he wished that this train would crash

1:01:22.243 --> 1:01:23.377
and kill everyone on board.

1:01:28.149 --> 1:01:29.417
- Seriously?

1:01:30.484 --> 1:01:32.319
Oh my God.

1:01:32.353 --> 1:01:33.287
(Exhaling sharply)

1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:34.255
Fuck.

1:01:37.124 --> 1:01:38.426
It's him.

1:01:39.527 --> 1:01:41.796
It's him. It's him.

1:01:43.330 --> 1:01:44.865
I knew he was a creep.

1:01:44.899 --> 1:01:46.167
This may be the first time

1:01:46.200 --> 1:01:48.002
you and I have ever agreed on anything.

1:01:48.035 --> 1:01:49.236
- We have to tell the others.

1:01:49.270 --> 1:01:51.439
- No, we need to sit tight

1:01:51.472 --> 1:01:54.508
until we make it back to the real world.

1:01:54.542 --> 1:01:56.377
- What if there are other people out there

1:01:56.410 --> 1:01:57.445
that he intends to kill,

1:01:57.478 --> 1:01:59.180
we knew and we did nothing about it?

1:01:59.213 --> 1:02:00.915
- Sucks to be them, I guess.

1:02:03.150 --> 1:02:05.219
But I'm not opening that door

1:02:05.252 --> 1:02:07.054
until we make it back to the station

1:02:07.088 --> 1:02:08.956
and the entire police department shows up.

1:02:08.989 --> 1:02:11.125
- Don't worry. I wouldn't ask you to.

1:02:15.062 --> 1:02:16.263
(Door unlocking)

1:02:17.331 --> 1:02:18.365
(Door closing)

1:02:26.173 --> 1:02:28.075
(Breathing shakily)

1:02:32.146 --> 1:02:34.048
(Gasping, screaming)

1:02:34.081 --> 1:02:35.116
- I come in peace!

1:02:35.149 --> 1:02:37.118
I promise! It's OK!

1:02:37.151 --> 1:02:38.185
- Sorry.

1:02:38.219 --> 1:02:39.553
- No, don't apologize. It's...

1:02:39.587 --> 1:02:41.222
Wait, what are you doing here?

1:02:41.255 --> 1:02:43.023
You should be in the bar with everyone.

1:02:43.057 --> 1:02:44.959
Carne said-- - Doc didn't think it was safe.

1:02:44.992 --> 1:02:47.928
So we barricaded ourselves in that stupid VIP room.

1:02:47.962 --> 1:02:50.164
It gave us time to think. - And?

1:02:50.197 --> 1:02:53.000
- What if the magician is behind all this?

1:02:53.033 --> 1:02:54.101
(Chuckling)

1:02:54.135 --> 1:02:55.903
- He's the only outside guest here.

1:02:55.936 --> 1:02:58.239
His whole job is to be in two places at once.

1:02:58.272 --> 1:02:59.940
- That doesn't make him a killer.

1:02:59.974 --> 1:03:02.143
- I know. But let's just find him and get proof.

1:03:02.176 --> 1:03:03.310
Or prove it's not him.

1:03:03.344 --> 1:03:05.045
At least it's something to start with.

1:03:07.148 --> 1:03:08.082
- OK.

1:03:09.450 --> 1:03:12.119
Let's go get Carne and talk to the magician together.

1:03:18.092 --> 1:03:20.027
(Sighing)

1:03:26.033 --> 1:03:27.935
(Coughing, sniffling)

1:03:32.139 --> 1:03:33.374
(Bottle slamming on table)

1:03:46.353 --> 1:03:47.855
- (Alana, on phone): Hi, Kenny.

1:03:51.926 --> 1:03:53.894
I've been waiting for you.

1:03:57.264 --> 1:03:58.566
Kiss me, Kenny.

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:00.935
Kiss me.

1:04:05.573 --> 1:04:07.541
(Breathing heavily)

1:04:07.575 --> 1:04:09.476
(Men screaming, laughing)

1:04:12.379 --> 1:04:13.380
- Whoa!

1:04:13.414 --> 1:04:15.316
(Men screaming, laughing)

1:04:19.153 --> 1:04:20.621
(Kenny screaming)

1:04:20.654 --> 1:04:22.356
- It's a dead body!

1:04:22.389 --> 1:04:23.424
(Phone smashing)

1:04:26.060 --> 1:04:27.928
(Grunting, breathing heavily)

1:04:32.166 --> 1:04:33.234
- (Alana): Hi, Kenny.

1:04:33.267 --> 1:04:34.668
- Whoa!

1:04:34.702 --> 1:04:36.637
(Breathing heavily)

1:04:36.670 --> 1:04:37.972
I'm sorry!

1:04:38.005 --> 1:04:39.306
- I've been waiting for you.

1:04:39.340 --> 1:04:41.108
- OK? I know I'm an asshole!

1:04:41.141 --> 1:04:42.142
Fuck!

1:04:43.244 --> 1:04:44.612
- Kiss me, Kenny .

1:04:46.013 --> 1:04:47.114
Kiss me.

1:04:49.183 --> 1:04:51.051
- Whoa! Ah!

1:04:52.453 --> 1:04:54.154
(Men screaming, laughing)

1:05:01.595 --> 1:05:03.530
(Kenny screaming)

1:05:09.503 --> 1:05:10.971
Ah!

1:05:16.243 --> 1:05:18.145
(Grunting, groaning)

1:05:24.018 --> 1:05:25.719
- I'm the president of this fraternity.

1:05:25.753 --> 1:05:27.254
This is my event.

1:05:27.288 --> 1:05:29.990
I--I should be out there with them representing us.

1:05:30.024 --> 1:05:31.125
- I mean, you can go.

1:05:31.158 --> 1:05:32.593
It's not like they locked us in here.

1:05:32.626 --> 1:05:34.695
- Well, maybe I will.

1:05:34.728 --> 1:05:37.498
I--I mean, we deserve to know what's going on, right?

1:05:39.466 --> 1:05:41.235
They let you go out there with them?

1:05:41.268 --> 1:05:43.737
- What? Uh, no, Jesus...

1:05:43.771 --> 1:05:47.441
We're, um, gonna go backstage to find the magician.

1:05:48.509 --> 1:05:50.277
- Find anything?

1:05:51.445 --> 1:05:52.579
What?

Before whoever's doing this gets their hands on that goddamn gun!

1:22:51.431 --> 1:22:53.366
(Breathing heavily)

1:22:57.270 --> 1:23:00.506
Oh, it's gonna be OK.

1:23:00.540 --> 1:23:02.075
- You don't know that.

1:23:02.108 --> 1:23:04.644
The killer still wants to kill me.

1:23:04.677 --> 1:23:06.379
I don't want to die.

1:23:06.412 --> 1:23:08.047
(Phone buzzing, chiming)

1:23:08.081 --> 1:23:09.315
Oh my God! We have service!

1:23:09.349 --> 1:23:11.617
We have to call the police or a helicopter.

1:23:11.651 --> 1:23:13.252
I--I need my phone.

1:23:13.286 --> 1:23:15.154
Ow! You're hurting me!

1:23:16.289 --> 1:23:17.590
- Good!

1:23:17.623 --> 1:23:20.760
You selfish, spoiled little whore!

1:23:20.793 --> 1:23:22.829
(Whimpering)

1:23:22.862 --> 1:23:26.666
I hope you feel so much pain that you beg me--beg me

1:23:26.699 --> 1:23:29.168
to put you out of your misery.

1:23:29.202 --> 1:23:30.336
(Whimpering)

1:23:30.370 --> 1:23:32.638
I saved the best till last.

1:23:32.672 --> 1:23:34.107
- No.

1:23:34.140 --> 1:23:36.776
- 'Cause you were the guiltiest one of all.

1:23:36.809 --> 1:23:40.847
Do you even know how you fucked him up?

1:23:40.880 --> 1:23:43.149
My sweet little boy!

1:23:43.182 --> 1:23:45.151
(Sobbing)

1:23:45.184 --> 1:23:48.321
Those monsters, they're gonna pay for what they did to you.

1:23:48.354 --> 1:23:49.522
They're gonna pay.

1:23:49.555 --> 1:23:52.158
OK, I'm sorry.

1:23:52.191 --> 1:23:53.259
I'm sorry.

1:23:53.292 --> 1:23:57.563
Tell me again, who did this to you?

1:23:57.597 --> 1:23:59.532
(Sniffling, breathing heavily)

1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:03.136
- It was a guy named Doc...

1:24:05.438 --> 1:24:09.075
and Mo and Jackson...

1:24:10.176 --> 1:24:11.511
and Mitchy...

1:24:14.180 --> 1:24:16.349
and a pretty girl named Alana.

1:24:19.752 --> 1:24:24.457
- Doc and Mo and Jackson...

1:24:24.490 --> 1:24:25.591
and Mitchy...

1:24:26.759 --> 1:24:28.728
- And a pretty girl named Alana.

1:24:28.761 --> 1:24:31.631
- And a pretty girl named Alana!

1:24:31.664 --> 1:24:34.200
- You lured him. You tricked him.

1:24:34.233 --> 1:24:35.635
And now my boy is dead!

1:24:35.668 --> 1:24:37.437
- I'm so sorry about that.

1:24:37.470 --> 1:24:38.805
- Shut the fuck up!

1:24:53.619 --> 1:24:55.154
- Where is it?

1:24:56.222 --> 1:24:57.523
(Sighing)

1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:04.464
- I killed that trashy magician

1:25:04.497 --> 1:25:07.166
because of what he did to my Kenny.

1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:09.435
You--you...

1:25:09.469 --> 1:25:13.940
I'm gonna make you suffer more than anyone.

1:25:13.973 --> 1:25:18.211
I'm gonna make you suffer for everything that you did!

1:25:18.244 --> 1:25:19.479
- No!

1:25:19.512 --> 1:25:21.214
(Grunting)

1:25:21.247 --> 1:25:22.882
(Screaming)

1:25:24.617 --> 1:25:25.885
- Oh!

1:25:29.856 --> 1:25:31.524
(Breathing shakily)

1:25:39.365 --> 1:25:40.833
(Screaming)

1:25:40.867 --> 1:25:42.568
(Screaming, grunting)

1:25:48.407 --> 1:25:49.976
- No!

1:25:50.009 --> 1:25:51.711
I didn't want to do it. I swear!

1:25:51.744 --> 1:25:53.946
- And yet, you did!

1:25:53.980 --> 1:25:56.616
Even after what happened,

1:25:56.649 --> 1:25:59.719
you still went out with that party crowd

1:25:59.752 --> 1:26:03.322
trying to destroy even more young boys' lives!

1:26:03.356 --> 1:26:05.925
- No, no, no! I swear! I swear I'm a good person!

1:26:05.958 --> 1:26:07.693
- Oh!

1:26:07.727 --> 1:26:11.831
It was just my son's life that you ruined?

1:26:11.864 --> 1:26:13.766
Bullshit!

1:26:13.799 --> 1:26:15.334
(Grunting)

1:26:26.879 --> 1:26:28.314
Ha! Just what you deserve.

1:26:28.347 --> 1:26:30.650
- Alana? Carne?

1:26:30.683 --> 1:26:31.884
(Gasping, breathing heavily)

1:26:31.918 --> 1:26:33.953
Alana! What's happening?

1:26:35.288 --> 1:26:36.889
- I'm gonna throw you out there,

1:26:36.923 --> 1:26:40.726
and you're gonna break every single bone in your body!

1:26:42.328 --> 1:26:43.829
(Breathing heavily)

1:26:43.863 --> 1:26:45.598
(Gun clicking)

1:26:45.631 --> 1:26:46.866
- Fuck!

1:26:48.568 --> 1:26:49.936
- Oopsie!

1:26:49.969 --> 1:26:51.370
- Let me in!

1:26:51.404 --> 1:26:53.005
- Nothing can stop me.

1:26:56.409 --> 1:26:58.511
(Grunting)

1:27:00.046 --> 1:27:03.716
(Groaning, screaming)

1:27:03.749 --> 1:27:06.285
- Die, you psycho!

1:27:11.457 --> 1:27:12.825
(Sobbing)

1:27:20.366 --> 1:27:22.835
