00:24.240 --> 00:25.321
Hi.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.441
Is there a problem?

00:30.560 --> 00:32.767
Jack Benson was a friend of mine.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.481
I'm...

00:35.840 --> 00:37.524
I'm so sorry.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.563
You were the one in charge, right?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.244
Some kind of manager?

00:41.320 --> 00:42.560
Uh, he... He was my friend, too.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.371
Jack's wife said it was your fault.
That true?

00:47.320 --> 00:49.129
You know what? Um, never mind.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.965
I think I'm just gonna
go somewhere else.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.566
Hey! I asked you a question.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.483
Stay away from me.

00:57.840 --> 00:58.841
Oh!

01:00.600 --> 01:01.647
What the hell?

01:03.240 --> 01:04.241
You did that?

01:04.319 --> 01:05.810
No, I... I swear.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.407
Get away from me!

01:27.800 --> 01:31.691
No. Lord, please. Not again.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.489
We have a mission.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.210
Any specifics?

02:05.400 --> 02:06.561
No.

02:09.880 --> 02:13.168
Well, we should follow
the same plan as before.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.891
Take separate routes back,
stagger our timing,

02:15.960 --> 02:17.644
- so no one suspects...

02:26.040 --> 02:29.601
Wait, a telekinetic?
I thought they didn't exist.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.011
We've never verified one.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.003
That's why we're going to Batesville.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.606
To conduct an
Index Asset Evaluation and Intake.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.251
Does that mean we talk to her
and see if she has powers?

02:38.320 --> 02:39.446
Basically.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.844
Well, that needs a better name.
Less IRS, more better.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.843
Something like "The Welcome Wagon."

02:45.920 --> 02:49.208
I want you to pay close
attention on this one, Skye.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.281
It's an opportunity

02:50.360 --> 02:52.601
to learn how to deal with someone
with newfound abilities.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.524
It's not like I've never done this before.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.042
I found Mike Peterson before you did.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.326
Remember how that went?

02:59.400 --> 03:02.609
This is your chance to see
how it's done when it's done right.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.762
How many people like this
have you encountered?

03:04.840 --> 03:07.810
A handful. There's not
that many people on the Index.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.566
They must wig out when they see
the S.H.I.E.L.D. trucks roll up.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.926
Each case is different.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.365
Some people are in complete denial

03:14.440 --> 03:16.249
that there's anything's unusual
about them.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.606
It's a delicate process.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.205
And from our reports,

03:19.280 --> 03:22.090
this sounds like
a particularly sensitive situation.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.924
"Particle Accelerator Explodes.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.480
"Hannah Hutchins,
one of the Quality Control engineers."

03:27.120 --> 03:28.326
Was it her fault?

03:28.400 --> 03:29.686
The town blames her.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.604
Four technicians died
in that blast on her watch.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.047
It's terrible. All those families.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.724
Small church community.
They're pretty rattled.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.767
She must be, too.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.842
Friends, coworkers dead,
and on top of all that,

03:39.920 --> 03:42.730
she might have some crazy power
she can't understand.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.165
Or control.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.004
Sir.
The Department of Energy's declared

03:46.120 --> 03:48.521
the particle acceleration lab
too dangerous to enter.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.602
But the good news
is we still think we can retrieve

03:50.680 --> 03:52.569
the disaster event data
from the instruments.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.246
We'll determine the cause
and see if there's any correlation

03:55.320 --> 03:57.641
between telekinesis
spontaneously forming

03:57.720 --> 03:59.848
and a particle accelerator exploding.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.649
Well, it does use giant magnets

04:01.760 --> 04:04.161
to fire billions of subatomic particles

04:04.240 --> 04:06.641
into their anti-particles
at the speed of light

04:06.720 --> 04:10.327
to create miniature Big Bangs,
so it seems like a good place to start.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.846
I read.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.160
I'll try not to mention Big Bangs

04:15.240 --> 04:16.844
when we talk to Hutchins
about the explosion.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.000
You'll stay in the car.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.649
This is a delicate situation.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.882
We don't know what kind of danger
this woman poses,

04:21.959 --> 04:24.930
so I'll make initial contact
with Agents Ward and May.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.571
Wheels up in five. Better strap in.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.005
It's a delicate situation,

04:29.120 --> 04:32.044
so you're bringing along
Warm and Fuzzy?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.449
- Hey, guys.
-You're late.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.561
We know what you did!

04:47.680 --> 04:50.684
She blew up that gas station.
Why aren't you arresting her?

04:57.320 --> 05:00.563
Officer, is there anything you could do
to get these people to disperse?

05:00.640 --> 05:02.642
Been trying, but it's a free country.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.643
Ms. Hutchins, I'm Agent Coulson.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.281
We specialize in strange occurrences
like the ones you've encountered.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.771
You've come to lock me up?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.080
To talk.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.490
Well, what good will that do?

05:15.560 --> 05:18.370
- Get out of here!
- We don't want you here anymore!

05:18.440 --> 05:20.488
Officers, get those people back.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.051
Murderer!

05:25.120 --> 05:26.929
Move it! Move out of the way! Go!

05:30.920 --> 05:33.287
It's her!
That freak just tried to kill us!

05:33.360 --> 05:34.441
Hey! Calm down.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.448
Easy, Officer. Put the gun down.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.040
Leave me alone!

05:40.120 --> 05:42.043
- Ms. Hutchins, please calm down.
-it wasn't me!

05:42.120 --> 05:44.851
Please calm down.
We're not gonna let anyone hurt you.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.444
Time to go.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.363
So much for the Welcome Wagon.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.606
We don't believe that people
have telekinetic powers, do we?

06:04.960 --> 06:07.884
Well, May was forced to sedate her.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.645
The woman made a police car move
with her mind.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.006
There's no principle
that would support...

06:12.080 --> 06:13.605
Telekinesis. Not yet.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.763
We did believe for a bit though,
remember? Freshman year?

06:16.840 --> 06:20.128
When Sally Webber made the books
fall off the table in neurobiology.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.249
Oh, well, that was
a particularly cruel prank.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.725
You screamed like a girl.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.770
I am a girl.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.002
You know, that's the one drawback
of graduating three years early.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.401
We never got to pull
any freshman pranks on anyone else.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.481
Mm.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.321
Fitz.

06:35.480 --> 06:39.007
Skye never went to the Academy.
She's a freshman.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.764
A wide-eyed little freshman.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.840
And being pranked is an integral part

06:43.920 --> 06:46.002
of becoming a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.127
Well, mandatory, really.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.409
Why not give her the full
S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy experience?

06:50.480 --> 06:53.211
It would be unjust
to deny her such a thing.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.887
Information data uploaded.
Let's get going.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.689
Yes, sir.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.566
Just a mattress, sir?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.927
It's a six-hour long ride to the Fridge.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.241
Fitz added magnetic shielding
to the Cage

07:09.320 --> 07:11.607
after Simmons had her scare.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.762
If Ms. Hutchins has this power,

07:13.840 --> 07:16.491
then that room
should keep it from getting out.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.404
But in there,
she'll be just as dangerous.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.366
How is she?

07:22.200 --> 07:24.282
The dendrotoxin's wearing off.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.046
She'll be awake soon, scared,
in a strange room.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.090
Our next interaction with her
is crucial to gaining her trust.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.842
Which is why I want you there.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.085
Are you sure that's a good idea?

07:37.720 --> 07:40.121
If Ms. Hutchins is going to believe
anything we say,

07:40.200 --> 07:43.124
she needs to know
we're not hiding things from her.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.602
Which means you
explaining the situation.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.843
What if that doesn't calm her down?
What if that makes her more agitated?

07:50.280 --> 07:52.521
Then he definitely wants me in there.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.246
Pretty much.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.565
I'll observe from out here.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.130
And I'll lose the tie.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.440
If she is telekinetic,

08:00.520 --> 08:03.649
I don't want to have a noose
around my neck.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.091
Brought you some water.

08:23.360 --> 08:26.921
It's okay. I'm Phil. This is Melinda May.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.685
How did I get here?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.366
I sedated you.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.128
I apologize for bringing you in that way.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.203
Things were escalating.
It was for everyone's safety.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.445
Everyone's safety. Good. Okay.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.528
Oh, lord, what have I done?

08:54.160 --> 08:59.451
I promise you, Ms. Hutchins,
nobody was hurt back there.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.643
Wherever I go, things turn bad.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.721
Were you angry at those people?
Back at the house?

09:09.360 --> 09:12.364
Um, angry? No. I know most of them.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.650
They were angry. I understand.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.245
Oh, God. Frank's wife.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.962
The way she was looking at me.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.611
Frank Delacort. He died in the accident.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.921
Because of me, they're gone.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.605
I killed them.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.929
So sad.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.081
And normal.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.367
These readings are
entirely within average ranges.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.805
Of course, it's hard to find something

09:45.880 --> 09:47.484
when you don't know
what you're looking for.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.564
All I can tell from these
brain waves is she's upset.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.051
You need a computer for that?

09:52.120 --> 09:54.202
May's in there.
The woman who shot her.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.765
Sedated her.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.810
Things got out of hand.
May sorted it out.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.363
- She's The Cavalry.
-Mm.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.847
Where does that name
come from anyway?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.045
- You don't know?
-Didn't Ward tell you?

10:07.320 --> 10:11.689
'Course not,
you spent no time at the Academy.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.884
It's quite a story.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.125
Yeah, well,
Ward isn't exactly a chatty S.O.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.329
Well, imagine if you will...

10:23.080 --> 10:26.527
A heavily secured compound.
Manama, Bahrain.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.570
Multiple S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
are taken hostage.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.483
Tortured for information.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.086
May's mission, eliminate the threat.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.124
You mean, kill people.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.486
Not people.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.564
Entire squads of mercenaries.
Almost 100.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.721
More than 100.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.485
More than 100 men. Heavily armed.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.167
Her vehicle got totaled, so she rode in...

10:47.240 --> 10:49.368
And, um,
she had an M249 in each hand.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.411
Right. In each hand.
And she rode in on a horse.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.568
Hence the name. The Cavalry.

10:56.640 --> 10:57.687
Is this real?

10:58.400 --> 11:02.121
She eliminated the enemy threat
single-handedly.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.684
She saw a lot of hurt that day.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.922
- Is that why she's so...
- Happy?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.446
Particle accelerator data loading.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.281
No!

11:33.280 --> 11:35.442
- You do not touch that!
-Ugh!

11:35.520 --> 11:37.807
Two semesters minimum
of holographic engineering

11:37.880 --> 11:39.245
before you get to touch this!

11:39.320 --> 11:41.049
All right! All right! I get it.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.761
I didn't go to your stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
Hogwarts, or whatever.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.764
I'm gonna go upstairs
and I'm gonna do my own research.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.921
On my computer.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.766
My boring, old, flat computer.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.170
Can you believe she bought that?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.123
A horse. Brilliant.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.843
You thinking of the next prank?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.649
We must carry on the tradition.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.324
Yeah.

12:07.760 --> 12:12.004
For weeks, I was getting reports
from Section 2,

12:12.440 --> 12:14.329
complaining that the coupling assembly

12:14.400 --> 12:16.482
was coming loose at the bolts.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.085
Tobias is the...

12:20.280 --> 12:23.090
He was the technician down there.

12:24.080 --> 12:28.324
He replaced the part
and we triple checked it for damage.

12:29.160 --> 12:33.370
Seems like I went down there
every few days.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.162
- Did you find a problem?
-No.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.842
But, clearly, I missed something.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.890
My team is working to determine
what really did happen.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.883
And what might have happened to you.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.250
To me? What do you mean?

12:51.480 --> 12:54.723
We believe, that somehow,
as a result of the accident,

12:54.800 --> 12:57.963
you acquired
some form of telekinetic ability.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.400
You think it's me?

13:02.240 --> 13:06.529
The police car? The gas...
You think I did that?

13:07.080 --> 13:08.127
We're not sure,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.362
and this can be a hard thing to hear,

13:10.440 --> 13:13.125
but all these events
have one thing in common.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.811
Me.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.482
But I'm not causing it. It's not me.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.928
I wish it were, because then
maybe I could make it stop.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.482
But if it's not you, then what is it?

13:30.120 --> 13:32.327
You people won't believe me.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.404
Try me.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.249
God's punishing me.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.647
He abandoned me.
He doesn't protect me anymore.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.643
That's why this is happening.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.641
Protect you from what?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.485
Demons, sir.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.847
I'm being haunted by demons.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.603
Delusions of being persecuted
aren't uncommon after trauma.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.047
She's certainly been through
her fair share.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.884
She's blaming herself. It's guilt.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.367
It's all of it. She's broken.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.245
Pore over the accident site.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.642
If that tragedy gave her powers,
we need to shut them down.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.762
If it wasn't her fault, even better.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.810
But until then,
she's a danger to all of us.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.486
Just let me go in and talk to her, sir.
As a friend.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.006
I can't let you do that.
It's too dangerous.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.003
She's not dangerous, she's nice.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.923
Like, overly nice.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.367
She never misses a birthday post
to her friends.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.807
Runs the youth program at her church.
Rescues dogs.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.882
Hannah's a safety inspector

14:52.960 --> 14:55.201
not just because she's detail-oriented,
but because she...

14:55.280 --> 14:57.169
- She genuinely cares.
-Right.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.605
And someone with that much empathy

14:58.680 --> 15:00.921
being responsible for
that much loss of life?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.126
She's devastated.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.601
Spouting nonsense
about God punishing her...

15:04.680 --> 15:08.162
People believe what they need
to believe to justify their actions.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.811
Is that how you justify
your shoot-first policy?

15:11.880 --> 15:13.962
At least let me try to repair that damage.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.646
Until we figure out
what's going on with her,

15:16.720 --> 15:19.690
she stays locked up,
and you stay away.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.049
I thought that was glued down.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.604
You're asking the right questions, Skye,

15:34.360 --> 15:37.967
but for now, that's all you get to do.
I'm sorry.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.964
I just don't understand her at all.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.963
Everything to her is just,

15:49.040 --> 15:52.203
"Target acquired. Threat eliminated."

15:52.280 --> 15:54.169
Well, she's a specialist.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.761
In one thing.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.640
You can catch a lot more flies with
honey than with napalm. Just saying.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.051
Hand me the lettuce?

16:01.120 --> 16:04.567
And she says I need to stay away,
but you know what I think?

16:06.520 --> 16:09.763
I think she needs to get laid.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.047
Might want to be
less confrontational with Agent May.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.321
I'm not scared of her.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.731
Well, I am, but just because

16:18.800 --> 16:21.121
The Cavalry shot 100 guys
on horseback

16:21.200 --> 16:23.487
doesn't mean she knows
how people work.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.925
Horseback?

16:25.600 --> 16:27.568
- Where'd you hear that?
-Fitz-Simmons.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.563
Were they messing with you?

16:31.960 --> 16:35.487
The story gets bigger every year.
It wasn't 100 guys.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.245
It was 20. Trained assassins.

16:38.720 --> 16:43.248
May crossed them off
with one pistol, no support.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.890
She rescued a bunch of agents?

16:44.960 --> 16:46.200
Mm-hmm.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.089
There definitely wasn't a horse.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.401
Well, if it went so well,

16:50.480 --> 16:53.245
why is she so squirrelly
about the name?

16:53.320 --> 16:56.164
Well, May's not in it for the glory.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.447
She got the job done. End of story.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.124
What did I do with that knife?

17:16.920 --> 17:18.046
Leave me alone!

17:19.720 --> 17:22.564
Oh, God. Please forgive me.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.245
Ah, this must be the coupling
from the reports.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.565
Oh, dear. The technicians were right.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.642
Were you even listening?

17:43.320 --> 17:44.606
You weren't even a wee bit scared?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.682
More disappointed, really.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.127
It's fine. It's fine.
I'm just work-shopping here.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.929
And, yes, I was listening.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.561
I was about to go fetch our old
magnetic couplings to run simulations.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.766
Oh, well, while you're in there,
grab some more diazepam for Hannah.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.922
She may need to be
more heavily sedated.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.411
And the prank needs more work as well.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.324
I know. I'm trying different things.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.482
It's the timing that matters, Simmons.

18:09.080 --> 18:11.401
Skye can't suspect a thing.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.051
Ward. Come look at this.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.810
Tobias Ford.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.850
Oh, isn't he one of the technicians
who died at the plant?

18:27.960 --> 18:31.123
Yeah. And he filed three
safety complaints in the past month.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.565
Each one in Hannah's department.

18:32.640 --> 18:36.247
She thought he was her friend,
but he had it out for her.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.006
The sad part is he was right.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.402
Oh, couplings.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.922
Couplings, couplings. Yes.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.164
That'll do, actually.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.641
Oh.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.130
Now this I could use.

19:13.040 --> 19:17.443
All I need now is a little bit of twine.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.807
And an unsuspecting victim.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.691
Oh, that's fantastic, that is.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.083
Well, that's Odd.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.205
My God.

19:34.360 --> 19:37.762
Fitz, look at this.
What are we seeing here?

19:38.560 --> 19:41.689
It's as if the explosion
tore open some sort of window to...

19:41.760 --> 19:43.205
- To hell!
-Aah!

19:49.280 --> 19:50.884
Simmons, are you okay?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.488
Sir. Hannah's telling the truth.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.050
She's not telekinetic.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.122
There's someone else on this plane.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.247
- What was that?
-The plane's lost power.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.846
We're going down.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.564
Ward, you certified?

20:20.640 --> 20:22.244
What about engine-driven generators?

20:22.320 --> 20:23.890
Those are dead, too.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.531
Switch batteries
to maintain flight controls.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.568
The rest will be needed
to keep the Cage shielded.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.564
Flaps 10. Lower landing gear.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.483
- What can I do?
-Buckle up.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.242
There's a decent size field up ahead,
but it's gonna be rough.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.606
Vertical landing's out.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.006
- Coming in a little hot.
-I got it.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.446
Our ear comms are usually
relayed through the plane,

21:20.520 --> 21:21.806
so here's some hardware.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.370
Did the girl do this to us, sir?

21:23.440 --> 21:25.807
We believe Ms. Hutchins
is the victim here.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.645
Our theories about her powers
have been disproved.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.529
- By who?
- I saw a ghost.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.406
I... I know how it sounds,

21:32.520 --> 21:34.568
but a man attacked me
and then he disappeared.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.130
Did you get a good look at him?

21:36.200 --> 21:37.770
He dematerialized!

21:37.840 --> 21:40.491
May, run your systems checks.
ls the Cage still shielded?

21:40.560 --> 21:42.210
Most of the power's dedicated to it.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.563
This man, or whatever he is,
has been tormenting Ms. Hutchins.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.927
The Cage might be the one thing
protecting her now.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.163
- We'll inform her.
-Sir. Can it be me to talk to Hannah?

21:51.240 --> 21:54.403
Her life has been turned upside down
and we stuck her in a nightmare box.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.164
She thinks she's being punished.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.447
Can I please be the one
to deliver the good news?

21:58.520 --> 22:01.251
That a non-corporeal madman
is hunting her?

22:01.320 --> 22:04.563
Again, I think it'd be better
coming from anyone else really.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.489
All right. I'll head upstairs,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.006
activate the emergency transceiver
and radio HQ.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.129
Ward, take a firearm.
Escort Fitz-Simmons downstairs,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.806
assess the damage,
get us up and running...

22:15.880 --> 22:19.930
Wait. Guys, um, where's Fitz?

22:20.000 --> 22:23.686
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

22:23.760 --> 22:25.808
What the hell's happening?

22:27.720 --> 22:29.165
Did we crash?

22:29.240 --> 22:30.651
Who was screaming?

22:31.320 --> 22:34.529
This is not funny, Jemma.
If this is a prank.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.045
This is a prank.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.161
Clever.

23:01.720 --> 23:05.645
Simmons? Come on, turn on the lights.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.210
Thank God! Where have you been?

23:23.280 --> 23:25.886
I have been locked in a closet,
freaking out,

23:25.960 --> 23:27.371
thanks to you two geniuses.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.851
That wasn't us.

23:29.240 --> 23:30.571
Well, then who was it?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.085
We found Fitz.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.400
Good, we'll need him.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.768
Looks like the main problem
is in avionics bay two.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.525
- He took out all systems.
-Who's she talking about?

23:39.600 --> 23:42.251
Grab your equipment and get in there.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.449
I'm gonna power-down flight controls
to conserve energy

23:45.520 --> 23:48.000
and then go defend the Cage door.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.003
In case this ghost comes knocking.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.082
Did she just say "ghost"?

24:01.320 --> 24:05.211
Mayday, mayday.
Region North, this is S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6.

24:05.280 --> 24:07.408
We've lost electrical and are grounded.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.051
Calculating coordinates.
Requesting support...

24:15.160 --> 24:17.811
1990s technology at its best.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.321
Hannah?

24:23.280 --> 24:25.009
Who's there?

24:28.920 --> 24:31.287
My name is Skye. We haven't met yet.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.442
We crashed, didn't we?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.884
Are you all hurt? I'm so sorry.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.803
No. No, no, we're okay.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.724
Whatever's happening,
it's not your fault.

24:42.400 --> 24:43.731
We were wrong.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.202
But you need to stay in that room
so that you're safe.

24:47.960 --> 24:52.090
Something bad is out here.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.089
Demons.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.122
I don't know what it is.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.245
Do you believe in God?

25:13.160 --> 25:14.446
Honestly?

25:16.520 --> 25:17.931
Not really.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.640
Well, I do.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.281
And I know that he's punishing me.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.361
And I deserve it.

25:25.440 --> 25:29.525
No. No, you don't. No one does.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.401
I had a few nuns around me growing up

25:35.480 --> 25:37.642
and they would talk like that.

25:37.720 --> 25:42.203
Scaring kids with stories of God's wrath.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.686
It made me not want to believe.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.525
The only words that stuck with me

25:49.600 --> 25:52.365
were something Sister McKenna said,

25:52.440 --> 25:54.010
from the Bible, I think.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.401
She said, "God is love."

25:58.600 --> 26:00.967
It's simple and it's a little sappy,

26:01.880 --> 26:03.769
but that's the version I like.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.965
"God is love."

26:07.480 --> 26:09.721
The thing that holds us together.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.401
And if that's true,

26:11.480 --> 26:14.848
I don't think he would punish you
for making a mistake.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.526
I think he'd forgive a mistake.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.724
I want to believe that, I do.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.206
I'll stand guard now.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.371
Coulson needs help
with the emergency transceiver.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.209
I would rather stay here for a while...

26:29.280 --> 26:32.921
It needs to get done, not discussed.
That's an order.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.681
I'll be nearby if you need me, okay?

26:41.680 --> 26:45.127
Try not to hurt her any more
than you already have, Agent May.

26:50.040 --> 26:53.249
He thinks it's hell,
but I think it's an alien world.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.810
Fitz, it was stunning.

26:54.880 --> 26:58.043
Well, there were reports in London
after the spaceship landed

26:58.120 --> 27:01.567
of multiple portals opening.
Thor passing between worlds.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.081
You think that's what
they were researching at that lab?

27:04.160 --> 27:06.766
Trying to create another portal, yes.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.205
Failing, until a malfunction
produced a burst of energy.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.850
This ghost is a man

27:12.920 --> 27:15.810
trapped between
our universe and another.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.482
Perhaps that's how all ghosts are.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.403
It's a simple explanation, really.

27:20.480 --> 27:23.051
Simple would be a relative term
in this case.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.167
Bloody hell.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.163
He was thorough.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.605
- on, God.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.771
The plane's on uneven ground,
could just be settling.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.569
Or the other thing.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.685
Get to work.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.487
Clear.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.968
Ward, help!

28:14.400 --> 28:15.606
Quiet.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.083
on!

28:38.160 --> 28:39.924
Help!

28:55.320 --> 28:57.687
Seems like a hardware issue,
not firmware.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.410
I should be with Hannah anyway.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.891
No wonder
she keeps screaming in there.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.406
You keep sending in The Cavalry,
you're bound to get a reaction like that.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.686
Don't call her that.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.570
Why not? No normal person
can shoot 100 Bahraini...

29:07.680 --> 29:09.330
That's not how it went down.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.970
Whatever, 20. I don't...

29:11.040 --> 29:13.566
She didn't have a gun. None of us did.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.287
And it wasn't a rescue, or an assault,

29:18.400 --> 29:21.290
whatever they say
at the Academy these days.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.362
We were the Welcome Wagon.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.044
And it went south.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.324
- How many...
-Plenty.

29:35.320 --> 29:39.006
A civilian girl and a few of our guys
were stuck inside a building

29:39.080 --> 29:43.847
being held by the followers
of this gifted individual.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.363
Or worshippers. We never found out.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.206
May did.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.530
She took it upon herself to get them out.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.643
Said she could fix the problem.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.922
So she went in,
crossed off the enemy force.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.405
Didn't say how.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.282
Did she lose anyone in there?

30:15.640 --> 30:16.801
Herself.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.528
May used to be different.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.966
She was always quiet, she just...

30:26.800 --> 30:27.926
She was warm.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.004
Fearless in a different way.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.000
Getting in trouble, pulling pranks.

30:35.360 --> 30:39.331
Thought rules were meant to be broken.
Sound familiar?

30:41.200 --> 30:43.680
But when she walked out
of that building,

30:45.640 --> 30:47.608
it was like that part of her was gone.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.642
I tried to comfort her,

30:52.480 --> 30:54.926
but she wouldn't tell me
what went down in there.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.409
What did you say?

31:00.720 --> 31:03.610
I said the words
I thought she needed to hear.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.606
That's why you want her on the plane.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.328
To see if that person
is still in there somewhere.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.084
The lock is jammed.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.209
Let me in or let her out.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.647
- That's not up to us.
-Let her out!

31:37.240 --> 31:38.810
Talk to me. What's happening?

31:38.880 --> 31:41.167
May, he's disappearing.

31:41.240 --> 31:42.651
He's passing between worlds.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.200
It seems a little less of him is returning
every time he appears.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.964
But why is he after you guys?

31:47.040 --> 31:49.088
Because he can't get to Hannah
in there. She's safe.

31:49.160 --> 31:52.323
If we wait it out,
maybe he'll disappear fully.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.045
What are you going to do?

32:23.560 --> 32:25.449
Fix the problem.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.730
We gotta find a way out of here.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.488
Any of this crap still work?

32:38.480 --> 32:40.369
There he is.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.766
What happened?

32:42.840 --> 32:44.569
Well, we lost communication.

32:44.640 --> 32:47.610
And you were hit
with a very large plumber's wrench.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.284
- A wrench?
-Yeah.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.806
That guy's traveling
back and forth between alien worlds

32:52.880 --> 32:54.405
with a wrench?

32:54.480 --> 32:57.131
Must have been in his hand
when the blast hit.

32:57.200 --> 33:01.171
Not the kind of wrench you would
use to loosen a coupling, is it?

33:01.880 --> 33:03.006
...there?

33:03.080 --> 33:04.764
Maybe it doesn't work after all.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.647
Uh, yes, yes, we're here, sir.
Where did you go?

33:07.720 --> 33:10.564
Nowhere.
We were attacked. Locked in.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.926
Then the guy disappeared.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.331
Hey, that's our story.

33:13.400 --> 33:16.131
- Is May with you guys?
-She isn't with you?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.924
I don't mean to scare you.
I just need to use you as bait.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.048
Well, that's comforting.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.130
To draw him out, away from my people.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.084
Then what will you do?

33:37.880 --> 33:39.609
Whatever I have to.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.205
And you're sure this is how to do it?

33:41.280 --> 33:42.850
Yes, I'll max the signal

33:42.920 --> 33:44.684
and the transceiver will act as a trigger.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.485
Okay, fine.

33:51.920 --> 33:53.968
They only made 20 I think.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.161
Oh.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.329
So we believe that this man
is responsible for the blast?

34:02.400 --> 34:05.006
Skye said she thinks
he's the worker who filed all the reports.

34:05.080 --> 34:07.003
Tobias Ford. It looks like him.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.811
It makes no sense for a man
to complain about safety issues

34:09.880 --> 34:11.962
whilst causing them. Another theory is...

34:12.040 --> 34:14.168
Theories don't matter.
Only facts.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.681
And the fact is, a bullet will take you out
of whatever world you're in.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.569
Any idea which direction
May could have taken her?

34:19.639 --> 34:22.563
We'll deploy the Golden Retrievers.
They're in here.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.330
Fitz! This is no time
for childish nonsense like this!

34:28.400 --> 34:29.925
Pranking was your idea.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.971
And obviously,
I rigged this little beauty before I knew

34:34.040 --> 34:36.520
there was a dimension-jumping
psychopath in the mix.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.728
Wait, childish.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.324
This guy is childish.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.931
What are you getting at?

34:49.440 --> 34:50.851
Tobias.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.521
Is that you?

35:12.200 --> 35:14.089
He wanted her to notice him.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.561
Why would he file a complaint to her
office when there was nothing wrong

35:16.640 --> 35:18.802
and then cause
an actual safety issue himself?

35:18.880 --> 35:21.087
- To get her fired?
- To get her attention.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.650
To spend time with her. Think about it.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.484
He scared the guy who was
harassing her at the gas station.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.409
He tried to hit you with a cop car.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.284
When we took her into custody.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.691
Yeah, he's not trying to hurt her.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.170
He's trying to protect her.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.405
He likes her.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.685
Stay here.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.801
It's okay. It's okay.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.488
Tell him I won't hurt you.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.528
Tobias, wait. She's a friend.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.291
Hannah.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.966
You have to stop. Please.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.487
Listen. We believe
you're trapped between two worlds.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.289
- This world...
-And hell!

36:42.280 --> 36:44.681
I'm being dragged to hell for what I did.

36:45.560 --> 36:47.403
What did you do?

36:49.000 --> 36:52.209
Just loosen a few bolts
and then you'd visit.

36:52.880 --> 36:55.121
It was the best part of my day.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.844
I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean
for anyone to get hurt.

36:58.920 --> 37:00.285
Oh, no.

37:01.800 --> 37:02.961
Tobias.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.844
- How could you?
-I killed them.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.370
I know.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.886
And even worse,
everyone started blaming you.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.163
- I tried to stop them...
- But you hurt more people.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.607
I was trying to protect you from them.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.728
I was trying to atone for my sin.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.365
Hannah, please.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.728
Maybe if you forgive me,
I won't go to hell.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.687
Only God can forgive you.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.650
And he won't.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.848
You can't undo what's been done.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.368
That will be with you forever.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.201
But trying to hold on to this life,

37:43.320 --> 37:46.244
clinging to the person
you thought you could be?

37:47.240 --> 37:48.571
That's hell.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.925
And you're dragging her down with you.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.885
You have to let go.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.769
Before my people come
and make you do it.

38:06.760 --> 38:12.722
If you care about her,
and I know you do, let her go.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.201
Let the girl go, Tobias.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.287
Let the girl go.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.565
- Are you okay?
-Yeah.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.369
Let's go out. It's over.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.808
What did you say to him?

38:58.600 --> 39:01.171
Same words you said to me in Bahrain.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.801
Is she all right?

39:30.120 --> 39:31.360
Much better.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.481
Let me know if she needs anything.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.370
- Can Fitz repair it?
-No.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.531
This one's a lost cause.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.045
But May isn't.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.570
If anyone can bring her around, it's you.

39:55.640 --> 39:58.166
You know what makes people tick.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.651
Pun intended.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.004
So do you. You see the good in them.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.364
You were a friend to Hannah,

40:08.440 --> 40:10.886
you can't wait to get inside May's head,

40:10.960 --> 40:13.088
and you figured out Tobias
without even trying.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.008
Guess I'm full of surprises.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.690
But this isn't one of them.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.364
I wanted you paying close attention

40:21.480 --> 40:24.689
to the Index Asset Evaluation
and Intake process,

40:24.760 --> 40:27.570
because someday,
you'll be really good at it.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.804
Even the best.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.209
Thanks, A.C.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.324
Maybe you'll get to rename it.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.885
Good, 'cause that name is super stupid.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.325
I know.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.330
Mind if I keep you company?

41:02.840 --> 41:03.921
Cool.

41:30.840 --> 41:31.841
Ta-da!

41:32.400 --> 41:34.448
- That isn't a word in our language.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.165
- I've never heard of it.
-I'm checking.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.321
"Our language"?

41:37.400 --> 41:40.609
You mean, the English language
first spoken in England?

41:40.680 --> 41:44.730
"Aglet. A plastic or metal tube
covering the end of a shoelace."

41:44.800 --> 41:45.801
--Oh, come on.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.609
She used her Britishness against us.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.170
It's a word.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.889
It's not funny.

41:55.960 --> 41:57.405
I was sleeping peacefully.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.764
- Very clever, Simmons.
-I didn't do it.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.200
Well, Ward. I don't appreciate...

42:06.280 --> 42:07.281
Don't look at me!

42:10.560 --> 42:12.847
- Okay, well, Skye.
- No.

42:12.920 --> 42:13.967
Well, who then?

42:14.040 --> 42:16.884
Look, the bunks
should be off limits, okay?

42:16.960 --> 42:18.121
--Don't laugh!

42:18.560 --> 42:21.962
Because I know it was one of you.
