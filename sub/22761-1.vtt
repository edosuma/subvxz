Your house is so beautiful.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.017
Yes, it is.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.785
The art is exquisite.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.553
I actually majored
in art history,

10:55.589 --> 10:59.157
and you've amassed
quite a collection.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.792
I'm so glad
you approve.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.975
So, if there's anything
you'd like to know about me...

11:05.999 --> 11:07.399
That will be all.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.337
Come. This way.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.339
Oh... yes, okay.

11:14.374 --> 11:18.009
[Robert]:
Isn't that what I just said?

11:18.078 --> 11:21.179
Oh, just do
what I pay you to do!

11:23.116 --> 11:24.116
[Gasping]

11:27.921 --> 11:28.987
Hello?

11:29.022 --> 11:29.988
Hi.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.256
Hi.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.223
I'm Lizzie...

11:32.259 --> 11:33.259
Richfield.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.795
Megan's sister.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.763
Yeah. Um...

11:38.799 --> 11:39.731
Uh, yeah.

11:39.766 --> 11:40.832
This is my resume.

11:40.867 --> 11:41.867
No?

11:43.503 --> 11:45.370
You know,
Megan said you had one already,

11:45.405 --> 11:46.416
but I just brought
one just in case.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.505
Huh.

11:47.541 --> 11:51.076
Always be prepared,
that's my motto.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.879
Um, not really.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.581
I don't have a motto.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.183
The boy scouts say it,
and it's, uh...

11:58.218 --> 11:59.218
It's good advice.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.153
Huh.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.233
You'll be living here
at Ashford full-time,

12:04.257 --> 12:06.024
on call 24-7.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.236
The entire staff
will report to you.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.626
You're going
to be the liaison

12:08.662 --> 12:11.529
between me and the sale
here at Ashford.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.209
You'll need to pack up
and send all the antiques

12:13.233 --> 12:14.499
to the auction house.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.678
You'll also be coordinating
and planning

12:15.702 --> 12:19.270
the annual Marley family
Christmas Eve gala.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.349
This is going
to be the last one ever,

12:20.373 --> 12:21.272
so it's got
to be one for the books.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.707
My brother kip
will be home for it,

12:22.743 --> 12:24.476
as will my sister Sloane
and her family,

12:24.511 --> 12:25.443
I think,

12:25.479 --> 12:26.511
so you'll need to plan

12:26.546 --> 12:27.412
and coordinate
their arrivals as well.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.447
- So...
- And lastly,

12:29.516 --> 12:31.783
you're to see that all
my grandmother's needs are met.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.319
She still lives here at Ashford,
though not for much longer.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.420
Is that clear,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.822
or do you need me
to write that down?

12:39.659 --> 12:40.770
I'm sorry,
I'm a little confused.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.027
I thought
this was a job interview.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.107
No, an endorsement
from someone I trust

12:44.131 --> 12:45.430
is worth more than gold,

12:45.465 --> 12:46.909
and your sister
has never steered me wrong

12:46.933 --> 12:47.966
in a transaction.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.337
So I'm... a transaction?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.272
No, I... I didn't...

12:54.307 --> 12:55.106
I don't mean
that I don't see you

12:55.175 --> 12:56.175
as a woman...

12:56.209 --> 12:57.008
Uh, I, a...

12:57.043 --> 12:58.143
Person.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.178
I do.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.111
I mean, obviously,
you're a woman,

13:00.147 --> 13:01.045
and you're also a person.

13:01.081 --> 13:01.980
You're both.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.047
And I was
just kidding.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.116
Oh! Yeah.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.283
No, no, no, right.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.462
Right. Ha.
Yeah, I knew you were kidding.

13:06.486 --> 13:07.285
Oh, good.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.953
Yeah.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.258
So you start
right away.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.860
I'll make sure that Gerard
has your room ready, okay?

13:15.896 --> 13:18.096
Uh... huh.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.831
[♪♪♪]

13:22.869 --> 13:24.803
So, first day.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.237
Are you nervous?

13:26.273 --> 13:28.006
Insanely, yes.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.010
What else can you tell me
about Robert Marley?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.765
There's just
so little information about him

13:33.814 --> 13:35.613
online.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.715
You're cyber-
stalking him?

13:37.751 --> 13:39.551
It's called
due diligence, Meg.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.518
[Laughs]

13:40.554 --> 13:41.686
What?

13:41.755 --> 13:42.520
I just want to know
what I'm walking into

13:42.589 --> 13:43.589
this morning.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.390
Like you don't
Google your clients.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.392
Uh, when I get a listing
like Ashford,

13:47.460 --> 13:50.929
I tend not to ask
any questions...

13:50.964 --> 13:52.864
But...

13:52.899 --> 13:53.899
What did you find out?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.734
Not much.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.080
He brokers mergers
and acquisitions.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.938
His parents were killed
in a car accident

13:59.973 --> 14:00.939
when he was 13.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.208
So sad.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.021
His grandmother raised him
and his two younger siblings

14:05.045 --> 14:06.377
at Ashford.

14:06.446 --> 14:07.646
Yeah,
I know about his parents,

14:07.681 --> 14:09.214
and it's awful.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.748
I haven't met
his siblings yet,

14:10.817 --> 14:12.183
but I'm really looking
forward to,

14:12.219 --> 14:13.585
especially kip Marley.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.719
They say

14:14.754 --> 14:16.888
he's the most eligible
bachelor in D.C.,

14:16.923 --> 14:18.534
and you're sort of going
to be living with him.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.858
It's a job, Megan.

14:19.926 --> 14:20.992
I know, I know.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.026
And like you said,
it's temporary.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.094
Yes,

14:23.163 --> 14:24.340
and it could be
very temporary.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.604
I already have
a potential buyer

14:25.632 --> 14:27.465
who's interested
in looking at the house.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.200
It's not a house,
it's a county.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.568
I'm not kidding.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.677
I'm going to need a GPS
to find my way around there.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.340
Oh, the place is so incredible,

14:35.375 --> 14:37.709
but it's so... cold.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.477
Don't you think?

14:39.512 --> 14:42.513
I need to get some Christmas
in there right away.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.389
Well, they picked
the perfect girl for the job.

14:45.085 --> 14:45.950
Call me later.

14:45.986 --> 14:46.818
With a full report.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.519
Yes. [Chuckles]

14:56.863 --> 14:58.596
Miss Richfield,
allow me.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.198
Gerard,
if we're going to be friends,

15:00.233 --> 15:01.633
you have to call me Lizzie.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.767
Yes, miss Lizzie.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.235
Guess that's a start.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.803
Uh, come.

15:05.872 --> 15:06.912
I'll show you
to your room.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.211
This is Robert's room,

15:13.246 --> 15:15.713
but we'll put you here
since it's close to miss Pippa,

15:15.782 --> 15:17.248
in case she
needs anything.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.383
Well, it's lovely,

15:18.418 --> 15:21.019
but I don't want
to put him out.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.798
Oh, he doesn't come home
for Christmas, ma'am.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.422
But the gala!

15:24.457 --> 15:26.724
It's the last one ever.
He's going to miss it?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.760
Why break his streak now?

15:28.795 --> 15:30.228
I'll meet you
in the kitchen

15:30.263 --> 15:31.229
once you get settled

15:31.264 --> 15:32.597
to go over
the to-do list,

15:32.666 --> 15:34.465
and if you're hungry,

15:34.501 --> 15:37.101
Anna can prepare
something for you.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.269
Thank you.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.404
Uh, Gerard?

15:39.472 --> 15:41.673
The last house manager...

15:41.741 --> 15:43.207
What happened to him?
Or her?

15:45.211 --> 15:47.145
Oh, um, miss Pippa
drove him away.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.050
Oh, miss Lizzie?

15:52.085 --> 15:53.318
Welcome to Ashford.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.555
I'll meet you
in the kitchen

15:57.590 --> 15:59.757
momentarily.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.193
Here is the supply order.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.472
We've been
without a house manager

16:03.496 --> 16:04.562
for a while,

16:04.631 --> 16:06.297
so we need it on a rush.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.299
The piano needs to be tuned.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.368
It's an 1870s Steinway grand,

16:10.403 --> 16:12.537
so find someone
well-versed in that.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.440
Miss Pippa wasn't fond
of the last gentleman.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.541
There's a crack

16:16.576 --> 16:19.143
in one
of the front hall windows.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.879
Have a stained-glass company
come to repair it.

16:21.915 --> 16:22.915
That exists? Okay.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.484
Stained...

16:26.553 --> 16:27.452
Glass...

16:27.520 --> 16:29.153
Company.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.521
That should be all for now.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.390
Ah, this is Anna.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.893
She'll take care
of all your dietary needs.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.362
Welcome, miss Richfield.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.031
I'm not used
to such formality.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.400
Please, call me Lizzie.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.836
Well, a certain level
of formality is expected.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.537
[Chuckles]

16:46.573 --> 16:47.739
So, can I get you anything?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.207
A sandwich?

16:49.275 --> 16:51.376
Omelette?
Perhaps a waffle?

16:51.411 --> 16:54.946
That's quite a menu,
but I ate at home.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.514
I think
I'll just get some coffee

16:56.583 --> 16:58.583
and head to the office.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.452
Oh! Thank you.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.689
Is, um, miss Pippa up yet?

17:04.723 --> 17:07.157
I'm looking forward
to seeing her again.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.930
You may wish
to manage your expectation

17:12.999 --> 17:14.932
where miss Pippa
is concerned.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.701
She is somewhat old-school.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.603
She doesn't engage
much with the staff.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.871
We tend to
meet her needs,

17:19.906 --> 17:22.006
and she leaves us alone.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.307
Got it.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.376
Thanks for the tip.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.788
Certainly,
and if you need anything,

17:25.811 --> 17:26.978
I'm always right here.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.746
Thank you.

17:31.317 --> 17:32.250
[Lizzie]:
Mrs. Marley!

17:32.318 --> 17:33.151
It's so nice to see you.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.452
I...

17:34.487 --> 17:36.254
I...

17:44.731 --> 17:45.963
Hi! Uh...

17:46.032 --> 17:47.610
I thought you weren't
coming home for Christmas.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.333
I'm not home.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.668
I'm working.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.070
As the executor of the estate,

17:52.105 --> 17:54.005
I need access
to my grandfather's files,

17:54.040 --> 17:55.306
which are here
at Ashford,

17:55.341 --> 17:57.875
on paper...
Nothing digital.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.244
Um, I need you
to scan this stack

18:00.313 --> 18:02.313
and send it to me
as soon as you can, please.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.348
Of course.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.116
Um...

18:05.185 --> 18:06.651
I hope you don't
mind sharing.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.518
Huh?

18:07.554 --> 18:08.753
The office, I mean.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.032
It'll only be for
a little while.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.289
I'm in and out,

18:11.357 --> 18:12.368
and I'll be spending
most of my time in the city.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.958
Yeah, well,
whatever works for you.

18:13.993 --> 18:14.993
Okay.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.464
Actually, I'm really glad
you're here.

18:19.499 --> 18:22.633
I already have some great ideas
for the Christmas Eve gala.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.268
I can't wait to get started.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.204
It's my favorite time
of the year,

18:26.239 --> 18:27.572
but actually,
you know,

18:27.607 --> 18:28.951
the lack of Christmas
in this house

18:28.975 --> 18:30.274
is frankly...

18:30.343 --> 18:32.243
Unacceptable.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.978
It's December already.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.213
The gala's Pippa's domain,

18:35.248 --> 18:36.214
so you'll need to run that
by her first.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.815
Oh.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.520
Um, you know,
speaking of that,

18:42.555 --> 18:45.790
any tips on how to approach her?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.259
She's not exactly... welcoming.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.472
I'm the last person
you should be asking

18:49.496 --> 18:50.706
for tips on how to manage Pippa.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.363
Why?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.733
She doesn't want
to sell Ashford,

18:55.768 --> 18:56.968
so I'm not exactly

18:57.003 --> 18:58.903
her favorite person
in the world right now.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.273
Then why are you?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.475
I mean, the house
is so beautiful.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.345
The history, the architecture,
the antiques...

19:07.380 --> 19:09.247
Could we just focus on this
for right now?

19:09.315 --> 19:10.615
Please scan that

19:10.650 --> 19:12.116
and email it to me
when you can.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.659
[Lizzie]:
I don't know

19:21.694 --> 19:22.938
which pieces
will be up for auction yet,

19:22.962 --> 19:25.062
but I can get you a list
by the end of the week.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.534
This is a weird question.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.480
I know you're an auction house,
but do you happen to know

19:31.504 --> 19:33.604
where I could find
a stained-glass repair company

19:33.673 --> 19:34.739
around here?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.207
[Car speeds up]

19:36.276 --> 19:37.975
Um, uh...
You know what?

19:38.044 --> 19:38.943
Can I call you right back?

19:39.012 --> 19:41.279
[Tires screech]

19:44.717 --> 19:45.717
Gerard?

19:46.419 --> 19:47.351
What was that noise?

19:47.387 --> 19:51.222
That was Mr. kip.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.691
Gerard!

19:53.726 --> 19:54.759
Please introduce me

19:54.794 --> 19:55.938
to this strange and
intriguing woman

19:55.962 --> 19:56.928
at our doorway.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.096
I'm Lizzie,
the new house manager.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.131
It's nice to meet you.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.032
Well, it's nice
to meet you too.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.900
Have you alerted
the press?

20:02.936 --> 20:04.702
Please do,

20:04.737 --> 20:05.881
because I think my
brother has finally made

20:05.905 --> 20:07.038
a right decision
in his life,

20:07.106 --> 20:09.874
and I cannot
believe it.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.076
I just mean
that our last house manager

20:12.145 --> 20:13.289
was far less
interesting than you.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.980
I mean, he was
terrified of Pippa.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.381
Can you believe that?

20:17.417 --> 20:20.484
My sweet little
grandmother, Pippa.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.564
This house definitely
requires someone

20:21.588 --> 20:23.521
who can hold
their own.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.389
I will certainly try my best.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.757
I don't doubt that,

20:26.793 --> 20:28.237
and I have very good instincts
about people.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.860
That's something
we have in common.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.462
Ah...

20:31.497 --> 20:34.098
And what do your instincts
tell you about me?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.700
I hope I made
a good showing.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.468
Gerard, tell me
I made a good showing.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.936
[Gerard]:
Excellent showing, sir.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.104
Thank you, Gerard.

20:40.139 --> 20:44.008
You definitely know
how to make an entrance.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.209
Yep...

20:45.245 --> 20:46.410
She definitely holds her own.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.815
All right, I'm going
to go see my grandmother,

20:50.850 --> 20:52.984
and we can get more
acquainted later.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.719
Gerard,
great to see you.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.686
Pippa Lou!

20:55.722 --> 20:57.321
Where are you-hoo?

20:57.357 --> 20:58.990
[Pippa]:
Is that my kip?

20:59.058 --> 21:01.559
It's so good to have you
home for Christmas.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.194
Where in the world
are you returning from

21:03.229 --> 21:04.462
this time?

21:04.497 --> 21:05.941
[Kip]: You would not believe
the sights I've seen.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.498
[They laugh]

21:14.807 --> 21:15.773
[Lizzie]:
Robert! Hi.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.908
I didn't know
you'd be in town.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.188
Um, are you coming to Ashford?
Do you need anything?

21:19.212 --> 21:20.378
No, I'm not,
actually.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.924
I have a meeting with
the estate's attorney

21:21.948 --> 21:23.748
just down the street,

21:23.783 --> 21:25.194
and then I have to go
straight back to D.C.

21:25.218 --> 21:26.384
Uh...

21:26.419 --> 21:28.019
Oh, wow.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.221
Oh, I promise everything
is getting done.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.490
That stack is scanned.
Uh, bills are paid.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.991
Piano's getting tuned
tomorrow.

21:34.027 --> 21:35.359
These are
Christmas decorations

21:35.428 --> 21:36.394
for Ashford.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.762
Can't wait
to get started.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.317
What's your fascination
with Christmas?

21:42.168 --> 21:43.534
It was my dad's favorite.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.471
To sit by the fire
with my family,

21:47.507 --> 21:48.472
the lights flickering
on the tree,

21:48.508 --> 21:49.440
I mean, it's...

21:49.475 --> 21:52.576
It's magical.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.645
We've never had that.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.247
Then you should
definitely come home.

21:56.282 --> 21:57.593
It's the last Christmas
at Ashford,

21:57.617 --> 21:58.694
and I promise I'm doing
everything I can

21:58.718 --> 22:00.618
to make it
beyond special.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.864
I don't think
anyone wants me there.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.354
Don't do anything

22:03.389 --> 22:05.189
without running the gala
theme by Pippa first.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.469
[Knocks]

22:18.504 --> 22:20.104
[Pippa]:
Who is it?

22:20.139 --> 22:21.405
Uh, it's...
It's Lizzie.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.007
Who's Lizzie?

22:23.042 --> 22:24.141
The new
house manager.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.512
What do you want?

22:29.582 --> 22:30.715
This is for your room,

22:30.783 --> 22:32.416
a little
Christmas spirit.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.755
Robert suggested
that I talk to you

22:37.790 --> 22:39.090
about my plans for the gala.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.558
Oh.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.827
My grandson is asking
my opinion about something.

22:42.862 --> 22:43.794
How novel.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.830
Yes, he...

22:45.898 --> 22:48.232
He said that you are in charge
of the gala.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.868
The only topic on which
Robert and I can agree.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.077
I was looking

22:59.112 --> 23:00.155
through some of the
old gala pictures...

23:00.179 --> 23:01.379
Why aren't you married?

23:01.414 --> 23:03.581
You're in your 30s, no?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.018
Well, I...

23:08.054 --> 23:10.020
I actually almost got engaged
a few months ago,

23:10.089 --> 23:13.157
and he was a good man,

23:13.192 --> 23:15.025
but I just wasn't
in love with him,

23:15.061 --> 23:16.761
and, you know,
I couldn't take that leap

23:16.796 --> 23:20.531
knowing that true love
might be out there somewhere,

23:20.566 --> 23:22.900
but I'm probably just being
a silly, hopeless romantic.

23:22.935 --> 23:23.768
You know what I mean?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.202
No.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.438
May I?

23:27.473 --> 23:28.839
Mm.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.578
Okay, so I have
a few options.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.548
Winter wonderland.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.883
Boring.

23:40.153 --> 23:40.985
Martinis and mistletoe?

23:41.020 --> 23:42.553
Gauche.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.591
Um, polar express?

23:47.627 --> 23:48.659
- No.
- Jingle mingle?

23:48.728 --> 23:49.927
- No.
- <i>Apres ski?</i>

23:49.962 --> 23:50.962
No!

23:54.734 --> 23:57.802
You're... you're right
to be underwhelmed.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.036
I mean,

23:59.105 --> 24:01.939
none of these really do
justice to Ashford,

24:01.974 --> 24:03.507
do they?

24:05.144 --> 24:06.844
It's the last gala,

24:06.913 --> 24:10.181
so it needs to be pure class.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.116
Yes, it does.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.020
What about...

24:16.055 --> 24:17.055
silver bells?

24:19.091 --> 24:20.091
Silver bells?

24:20.860 --> 24:22.159
Yeah.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.872
Uh, so the whole house
would be in silver and blue

24:23.896 --> 24:27.264
with bits of gold
and woodsy garland.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.500
Elegant, but warm.

24:29.535 --> 24:32.470
I think this house could use
a little more warmth.

24:32.505 --> 24:33.771
Do you, now?

24:38.077 --> 24:40.077
Very well, then.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.546
"Silver bells" is the theme.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.783
Spend what you must.

24:45.818 --> 24:49.286
I trust you will
not disappoint me.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.789
I will do my very best.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.657
Do better than that.

24:55.294 --> 24:56.327
Okay.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.396
Thank you.

25:02.735 --> 25:03.934
[♪♪♪]

25:08.474 --> 25:09.507
[Giggles]

25:17.216 --> 25:18.216
[Groans]

25:28.461 --> 25:31.228
[♪♪♪]

25:31.297 --> 25:33.163
[Lizzie]:
I've drawn up some plans.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.865
I was up all night.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.201
Oh, but it's so fun

25:37.236 --> 25:38.869
imagining people's reactions,
you know,

25:38.938 --> 25:41.038
when they walk
into the main hall.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.606
I can't wait for it to be done,

25:42.675 --> 25:44.341
and for miss Pippa to see it.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.844
You're quite good at this,
miss Lizzie.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.712
Thank you.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.781
Maybe in another life,
party planning was my path.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.784
Well, why not this life?

25:58.658 --> 26:00.457
Thank you.

26:00.526 --> 26:01.526
Oh, there you are.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.726
Looking everywhere
for you.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.827
On the jogging trails?

26:03.863 --> 26:05.129
Ha!

26:05.164 --> 26:07.042
Actually, I found
this incredible new restaurant

26:07.066 --> 26:10.200
that I think is perfect
to cater the gala.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.569
Oh, great.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.537
Send me the information,
and I'll look into it.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.239
Well, I can do
you one better.

26:15.308 --> 26:20.611
I secured us a private tasting
of their catering menu tonight.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.012
I had to pull a few favors,

26:22.048 --> 26:24.548
but anything to make
the last gala at Ashford

26:24.584 --> 26:26.417
the best it can be.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.454
We'll talk about Ashford
the entire time.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.256
I will bore you to death...

26:32.291 --> 26:35.125
And then we'll, uh,
expense it back to the estate.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.161
It's a business meal.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.496
Okay.
I appreciate you doing this.

26:39.532 --> 26:41.065
I knew I'd get you to cave.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.536
This is not
me caving.

26:45.571 --> 26:48.038
This is me working,
for you, actually,

26:48.107 --> 26:49.306
since you're my boss.

26:49.342 --> 26:51.575
Uh-uh-uh, that would be Robert
who is your boss.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.077
He cracks the whip.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.479
Sloane, Pippa, and I,
we just enjoy our lives.

26:55.514 --> 26:56.814
It's actually
the perfect dynamic

26:56.882 --> 26:57.915
for all of us.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.117
If it's okay to ask,

27:00.152 --> 27:02.920
what's the story
between Robert and Pippa?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.588
It seems... tense.

27:04.657 --> 27:05.956
Well, I mean,

27:05.992 --> 27:07.524
she's lived here
all of her life.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.460
Robert's just selling the place
from under her.

27:09.528 --> 27:10.995
What's to know?

27:11.030 --> 27:12.696
Where will she go?

27:12.732 --> 27:15.265
Again, you'll have to ask
the boss that question.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.635
He hasn't informed
the rest of us.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.770
Hmm.

27:19.805 --> 27:22.373
So, tonight, you and I,

27:22.408 --> 27:23.674
strozzi,

27:23.709 --> 27:25.109
downtown.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.243
Yep.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.244
Oh, and hey,
by the way?

27:27.279 --> 27:29.079
Silver bells?

27:29.115 --> 27:31.849
Really great idea.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.384
Thank you.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.559
[Phone rings]

27:46.732 --> 27:48.666
Robert.

27:48.701 --> 27:49.533
I need you
to pull a file for me.

27:49.568 --> 27:50.601
It should be

27:50.636 --> 27:51.780
in the second drawer
of the cabinet,

27:51.804 --> 27:54.738
labeled "Virginia
historical society."

27:54.774 --> 27:56.585
I was just taking
a little break from decorating,

27:56.609 --> 27:58.342
exploring the grounds.

27:58.411 --> 28:00.411
<i>Let me head to the house,
and I'll call you back.</i>

28:00.446 --> 28:02.880
<i>But where are you now?</i>

28:02.948 --> 28:05.382
I'm at the pond.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.384
I think
it's the most beautiful thing

28:07.420 --> 28:08.519
<i>I have ever seen.</i>

28:08.554 --> 28:09.687
I know.

28:09.755 --> 28:10.755
<i>It's incredible.</i>

28:10.790 --> 28:13.691
This was your playground
as a child!

28:14.727 --> 28:17.161
I don't know
if it's the air here

28:17.229 --> 28:18.762
or the view,

28:18.798 --> 28:22.466
<i>but... being at Ashford
makes you feel</i>

28:22.501 --> 28:26.336
<i>like you're on the verge
of something...</i>

28:26.372 --> 28:28.906
Like anything is possible.

28:30.476 --> 28:33.711
That pond was always
my favorite part of Ashford.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.699
Actually, it was the only thing
I liked about it.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.649
If you don't mind my asking,

28:38.684 --> 28:41.585
<i>why don't you want to be here,
Robert?</i>

28:41.620 --> 28:42.986
<i>It's Christmas.</i>

28:43.055 --> 28:44.822
You ask a lot of questions,

28:44.857 --> 28:47.624
<i>and, uh, my answer</i>

28:47.660 --> 28:49.760
is that it's just complicated.

28:49.795 --> 28:52.696
<i>I know
there's stuff from the past,</i>

28:52.732 --> 28:57.367
but Christmas is the time
when we get to let everything go

28:57.403 --> 28:58.869
and just be.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.842
Well, you have
to see it here today...

29:04.877 --> 29:06.021
With all the silver accents
going up...

29:06.045 --> 29:07.978
<i>Yeah, that sounds great.</i>

29:08.047 --> 29:09.925
<i>Pull that file for me
when you get up to the office</i>

29:09.949 --> 29:12.149
and call me back.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.487
[Music plays]

29:20.159 --> 29:22.926
[Music playing]

29:22.995 --> 29:25.963
[Laughter]

29:27.366 --> 29:31.735
[♪♪♪]

29:41.447 --> 29:42.713
[♪♪♪]

29:44.984 --> 29:46.464
It's really starting
to come together,

29:46.519 --> 29:47.519
don't you think?

30:00.266 --> 30:01.565
You ready?

30:02.768 --> 30:03.901
Wow.
I... I...

30:03.936 --> 30:05.435
I would compliment you,

30:05.471 --> 30:07.805
but words escape me,

30:07.840 --> 30:09.406
and that never happens.

30:09.441 --> 30:10.474
Thank you,

30:10.543 --> 30:11.686
but there's really no need to,

30:11.710 --> 30:14.011
seeing as how
this is a business meeting.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.579
Right, of course.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.348
Well, after you.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.087
Robert!

30:24.123 --> 30:26.023
Kip.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.369
You decided to come
home for Christmas.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.525
Yeah.
Um...

30:28.561 --> 30:31.428
There's a lot of work
to be done here anyway,

30:31.497 --> 30:32.396
so...

30:32.464 --> 30:34.097
I'm glad.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.212
[Kip]:
Yeah, it's great news.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.669
We're all beyond thrilled,

30:38.704 --> 30:39.781
but we have, uh,
reservations to get to,

30:39.805 --> 30:41.672
so we'll have
to catch up later.

30:41.740 --> 30:42.740
Okay, big brother?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.045
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.113
Here, I'll get
the door.

30:58.457 --> 30:59.256
[Lizzie]:
So...

30:59.291 --> 31:01.625
What's after the holidays?

31:01.694 --> 31:02.426
Athens.

31:02.461 --> 31:03.360
Oh.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.461
Ah, they have some

31:04.496 --> 31:05.507
of the most incredible
architectural feats

31:05.531 --> 31:06.797
in the world,

31:06.832 --> 31:08.677
and growing up at Ashford,
I knew I had to see it.

31:08.701 --> 31:09.867
I had to see the museums.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.135
I had to see the ruins.
I had to see everything.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.370
Experiencing other cultures

31:13.405 --> 31:14.838
through
their artistic expression.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.218
That's exactly
how I feel about it.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.452
That's why I majored
in art history.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.176
Well, you think
it's fascinating in books?

31:19.245 --> 31:21.445
It doesn't even compare
to seeing it in person.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.846
Oh, I bet.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.681
I'll have to take your word
for it, though.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.917
I haven't traveled much.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.486
There's so much to see
in the world, Lizzie.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.589
I even carry my passport
in my back pocket sometimes.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.668
In case you need
to leave the country

31:33.692 --> 31:34.558
at a moment's notice?

31:34.593 --> 31:35.692
Sure.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.105
Hey, you never know
when you have to bolt

31:37.129 --> 31:37.995
in the middle
of the night...

31:38.063 --> 31:39.630
[Laughs]

31:39.698 --> 31:40.831
Or, hey,

31:40.866 --> 31:43.500
maybe you get invited
to Athens or something.

31:50.843 --> 31:52.242
Oh! Oh, what?
What's wrong?

31:52.278 --> 31:53.210
Oh, I'm so sorry.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.411
No, I...
They... they...

31:54.446 --> 31:55.446
They put me in this room

31:55.481 --> 31:56.558
because it was
close to Pippa,

31:56.582 --> 31:57.481
and weren't coming
home for Christmas.

31:57.549 --> 31:58.582
No, no, no, no.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.118
It makes...
Um, I...

32:01.153 --> 32:03.031
I should have talked to Gerard
about the room arrangements.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.266
I'm the one who should be sorry.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.188
I will go somewhere else.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.523
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

32:06.558 --> 32:07.991
It makes sense

32:08.027 --> 32:08.825
that you'd be in here.

32:08.861 --> 32:09.960
Um, I'll just go

32:09.995 --> 32:11.895
to one of
the guest rooms.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.208
I'll, um...
I'll leave you to it.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.865
No, no, no,
that's okay.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.035
I wasn't here long enough
to unpack...

32:19.738 --> 32:21.471
Much.

32:23.876 --> 32:24.876
So, uh...

32:26.545 --> 32:29.413
How was your dinner
with my brother?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.581
It was a tasting
for the Christmas Eve gala.

32:31.650 --> 32:33.650
But it became a date.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.719
No, absolutely not.
That would be inappropriate.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.754
No, no, I'm...
I'm here to work.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.356
We kept it all about the food.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.925
Trust me, to kip,
it was a date.

32:41.961 --> 32:44.995
That guy goes zero to 60
faster than a Tesla,

32:45.030 --> 32:47.497
which he has one of those,

32:47.566 --> 32:48.899
corvette,

32:48.934 --> 32:50.067
Maserati, Ferrari...

32:50.135 --> 32:52.836
All paid for
by the estate.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.672
Must have cost him tonight,
though,

32:55.708 --> 32:58.608
climbing to the top
spot at Strozzi.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.211
Look, the food was great,
but if it was a date...

33:01.246 --> 33:02.045
And I don't
think it was...

33:02.081 --> 33:03.613
Ah...

33:03.649 --> 33:05.415
I would prefer
something more creative,

33:05.451 --> 33:09.052
like spending $20, Max.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.921
Well, that would
require imagination.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.124
Yes, it would.

33:15.828 --> 33:18.161
It's... it's a challenge
my mother gave my father

33:18.230 --> 33:19.563
on their first date.

33:21.233 --> 33:24.134
And what did he do for $20?

33:24.169 --> 33:26.370
Well,
my mother loves grilled cheese,

33:26.405 --> 33:28.005
so he bought some ingredients,

33:28.040 --> 33:29.706
and they had
a grilled cheese cook-off.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.575
[They laugh]

33:31.610 --> 33:32.854
He said, "if you're going
to make it a challenge,

33:32.878 --> 33:35.112
I'm going
to make it a challenge."

33:35.147 --> 33:36.413
She said
that that was the night

33:36.448 --> 33:37.781
she knew
he was the one for her.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.050
Hmm. So who won?

33:41.954 --> 33:42.986
They both did.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.389
Hmm.

33:46.825 --> 33:47.825
Well...

33:48.927 --> 33:50.087
It's an
interesting challenge.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.696
I'm going to have
to think about it.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.766
[Clears throat]
Uh...

33:57.736 --> 33:58.769
Good night, Lizzie.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.670
Good night.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.326
Um, it looks...
Festive.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.995
Uh, the whole house does.

34:25.030 --> 34:25.962
It's, uh...

34:25.998 --> 34:27.264
Mm...

34:27.299 --> 34:28.165
Beautiful?

34:28.199 --> 34:30.033
Mm... hmm...

34:30.069 --> 34:31.368
Comforting?

34:31.402 --> 34:32.502
Mm.

34:32.538 --> 34:33.937
Warm?

34:33.972 --> 34:35.138
Uh, unusual.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.505
[They laugh]

34:36.542 --> 34:37.873
You know
what your problem is?

34:37.909 --> 34:41.378
You haven't done Christmas
right.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.313
Christmas wasn't
a very happy time for us

34:43.348 --> 34:44.348
after my parents, uh...

34:47.386 --> 34:48.752
You know,
here at Ashford,

34:48.821 --> 34:50.353
it's, uh, it's all
about appearances.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.755
Throw an extravagant party,

34:52.791 --> 34:55.891
spend a few hours
with guests and colleagues,

34:55.928 --> 34:57.260
get in the newspaper,

34:57.296 --> 34:58.628
and then go
your separate ways.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.564
Hmm.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.201
Well, it's never too late
to start new traditions.

35:04.269 --> 35:05.502
[Laughs]

35:05.571 --> 35:07.504
Yes, my family
takes decorating

35:07.539 --> 35:09.206
very seriously...

35:09.241 --> 35:10.740
And food as well, so...

35:10.776 --> 35:12.642
This is the best
of both worlds.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.345
I give you
the popcorn garland.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.313
[Munching]

35:16.348 --> 35:17.114
[Laughs] It's for
the garland.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.116
Oh, okay.

35:19.184 --> 35:20.717
Popcorn garland.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.219
Yeah.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.787
Through here?

35:23.822 --> 35:25.956
Slowly. Nice.

35:26.024 --> 35:26.990
You're a natural.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.291
You know,

35:28.327 --> 35:30.994
usually we have the staff
do all the sewing, but...

35:31.029 --> 35:32.240
[Lizzie]: Well, why should
they have all the fun?

35:32.264 --> 35:33.029
[They laugh]

35:33.065 --> 35:33.997
[Kip]:
fun?

35:34.032 --> 35:35.332
I like fun.
What are we doing?

35:35.367 --> 35:36.733
Oh, this is popcorn garland.

35:36.768 --> 35:37.734
Ooh!

35:37.769 --> 35:38.735
Yeah, join us.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.003
Sure.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.516
[Meg]: The crown molding
throughout is original,

35:41.540 --> 35:45.442
and the chandelier
is quite exquisite.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.177
Everything in this house is.

35:47.212 --> 35:49.012
Now, let's head upstairs.

35:49.081 --> 35:49.813
I'll just take
a little of this.

35:49.882 --> 35:50.680
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.049
I've been working
on this.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.651
So uptight.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.253
Well, you're ruining
my popcorn garland.

35:56.288 --> 35:57.654
Yeah.

35:57.689 --> 35:58.900
Hey, I had a fun
time last night.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.457
Kip...

36:00.492 --> 36:01.925
Don't be inappropriate,
all right?

36:01.960 --> 36:03.238
Lizzie is just trying
to do her job.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.362
Oh...

36:05.397 --> 36:06.841
Robert, you may be the
executor of the estate,

36:06.865 --> 36:07.942
but you're not
the executor of me.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.933
[Robert chuckles]

36:10.002 --> 36:11.513
You see, Robert here,
he calls the shots,

36:11.537 --> 36:12.435
and we just go along
for the ride.

36:12.471 --> 36:13.570
Oh...

36:13.605 --> 36:14.782
Yeah, you don't have
any problem with that

36:14.806 --> 36:16.317
when you're cashing the checks,
do you, kip?

36:16.341 --> 36:17.652
I've told him
he can come work with me

36:17.676 --> 36:18.708
whenever he wants.

36:18.777 --> 36:19.777
Oh, that's nice.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.611
Work for you, not with you.

36:21.647 --> 36:22.612
Until you learn
the ropes,

36:22.648 --> 36:24.481
yes, kip.
There's a learning curve.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.650
And again,
I'm not interested.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.229
You've done enough
calling the shots all my life,

36:28.253 --> 36:29.085
and now you're
selling the house?

36:29.154 --> 36:30.320
And Pippa?

36:30.355 --> 36:32.066
I haven't seen Pippa
like this in I don't...

36:32.090 --> 36:33.924
- Uncle Robert!
- Hey!

36:34.860 --> 36:35.860
Uncle kip!

36:35.894 --> 36:36.693
There they are,
my boys!

36:36.728 --> 36:37.961
Oh!

36:37.996 --> 36:39.796
- Who's hungry?
- [Both]: Me!

36:39.831 --> 36:41.676
There's popcorn here,
but look out, there's a shark.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.001
Two trains, three delays,
and one case of motion sickness,

36:45.070 --> 36:46.903
but we are finally here.

36:46.939 --> 36:47.939
Hallelujah.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.372
Where is the wine?

36:49.408 --> 36:50.974
And who might you be?

36:51.009 --> 36:53.910
Uh, this is Lizzie,
our new house manager.

36:53.946 --> 36:56.446
And you're still here
after three weeks!

36:56.481 --> 36:57.514
Wow, that's
refreshing.

36:57.583 --> 36:58.915
I'm Sloane, the little sister.

36:59.885 --> 37:01.251
Where's grandmother?

37:01.320 --> 37:02.018
Uh, hello.

37:02.054 --> 37:02.919
Hi.

37:02.955 --> 37:04.187
Uh, she's
upstairs.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.900
She hasn't really come
out of her room lately.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.490
[Sloane]:
Hmm, I wonder why.

37:07.526 --> 37:09.693
Mm-hmm.

37:09.761 --> 37:10.772
Well, do you want
to go see her?

37:10.796 --> 37:12.028
- Yes.
- Okay.

37:12.064 --> 37:12.996
Uh, boys?

37:13.031 --> 37:13.830
You want
to go see Pippa?

37:13.865 --> 37:15.065
Yeah!

37:15.100 --> 37:17.100
All right, grab some popcorn,
and let's go.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.179
[Robert]:
Hey, careful, okay?

37:18.203 --> 37:19.547
Don't get that everywhere.
You got...

37:19.571 --> 37:20.982
[Kip]: Come on!
Oh, you got handfuls.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.046
[Sloane]:
Careful, careful.

37:27.112 --> 37:29.579
Home together at Christmas.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.214
It's going to be a fun reunion.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.357
[Lizzie]:
At Christmas,

37:39.391 --> 37:41.725
my father would line
a row of poinsettias

37:41.760 --> 37:43.627
down each side
of our driveway.

37:43.695 --> 37:44.594
I want to do
the same thing

37:44.663 --> 37:45.829
for the gala,

37:45.864 --> 37:47.664
but with a silver bow
around each one.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.132
I was thinking

37:49.201 --> 37:51.101
these would be nice
for the centerpieces.

37:51.169 --> 37:52.235
You have a gift for this.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.937
You think so?

37:53.972 --> 37:55.805
Well, planning it
has been so much fun.

37:55.874 --> 37:58.608
I feel invigorated.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.944
I just hope
miss Pippa approves.

38:00.979 --> 38:01.945
Well, let me
put it this way.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.246
If she didn't,

38:03.282 --> 38:05.615
you'd already be gone.

38:05.651 --> 38:06.983
That's very true.

38:08.220 --> 38:09.085
Where will
she go, Gerard,

38:09.121 --> 38:10.687
after the house is sold?

38:10.722 --> 38:11.888
Do you know?

38:11.923 --> 38:14.791
I can't say I'm privy
to that information.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.693
[Lizzie]:
I don't understand.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.296
I mean,
she loves this house so much.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.363
Do they need the money?

38:20.399 --> 38:21.364
[Robert]:
Trust me,

38:21.400 --> 38:23.300
it's not about the money.

38:23.335 --> 38:26.102
Pippa will be well
taken care of.

38:26.138 --> 38:29.906
I'll start lining up
the poinsettias outside.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.412
I don't mean to be nosy.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.013
Well, you're
quite good at it.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.652
Only because Pippa
very clearly wants to stay here.

38:42.688 --> 38:43.953
She can't.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.121
Why not?

38:45.157 --> 38:46.523
Lizzie,

38:46.558 --> 38:48.369
you don't have to get involved
with this, all right?

38:48.393 --> 38:50.193
It's already been decided.

38:50.262 --> 38:52.462
I know. It...

38:52.531 --> 38:54.230
It just makes me so sad for her.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.199
You know, she barely
comes out of her room.

38:56.268 --> 38:57.400
I'm only saying this

38:57.436 --> 38:58.802
because I want her
to be happy.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.303
And I want her to be safe.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.941
She has a heart arrhythmia.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.010
The stairs are too
much of a strain.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.678
I've tried
every possible solution

39:08.747 --> 39:09.879
for her to stay,

39:09.915 --> 39:10.947
but it's not up to me.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.060
I tried to get her
to move downstairs.

39:12.084 --> 39:13.516
She refused.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.919
I even looked
into installing an elevator,

39:15.954 --> 39:16.920
but she won't do it.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.221
She says

39:18.256 --> 39:20.216
that it "ruins the integrity
of the architecture."

39:22.894 --> 39:24.527
You're doing this for her.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.062
Yes.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.764
And I promise you,

39:27.799 --> 39:30.867
I will find a nice,
practical home for her.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.970
Then why is everyone
so upset with you about this?

39:34.005 --> 39:36.773
Because I have to make
the tough decisions,

39:36.842 --> 39:38.308
and you always
shoot the messenger.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.043
They don't understand,

39:40.078 --> 39:42.846
so...
They make me the bad guy.

39:45.684 --> 39:46.983
It's fine.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.551
I'm used to it.

39:52.257 --> 39:53.417
Why don't you keep the house?

39:55.527 --> 39:56.893
I don't want it.

39:56.928 --> 39:57.928
[Phone rings]

40:00.499 --> 40:01.898
Hmm, it's your sister.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.166
Megan?

40:04.236 --> 40:05.435
Uh-huh.

40:07.372 --> 40:08.372
An offer?

40:09.408 --> 40:10.607
Okay.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.442
Let me call you back
when I get to the office.

40:20.852 --> 40:21.985
Lizzie!

40:22.020 --> 40:24.521
The whole place
looks great.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.700
Well, it's just like
with the art.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.924
It's about placement...

40:27.993 --> 40:32.395
How to accent the beauty
of an already perfect home.

40:32.431 --> 40:33.541
Well, you definitely
made this place

40:33.565 --> 40:35.665
look more beautiful
than it was before.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.100
Thank you,

40:37.135 --> 40:38.935
but there's still
something missing.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.170
What could
be missing?

40:40.205 --> 40:41.938
It looks good.
It feels good.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.213
It's like a gift to the senses.

40:44.709 --> 40:45.608
That's it.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.709
Smell!

40:46.745 --> 40:47.844
Everything is beautiful,

40:47.879 --> 40:50.079
but this house needs
to smell like...

40:50.115 --> 40:54.017
Like cinnamon, cookies,
and... pine.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.052
Thank you, kip.

40:55.086 --> 40:56.319
Yeah!

40:56.354 --> 40:57.832
Uh, so what do we do?
Do we go to a tree lot?

40:57.856 --> 40:59.255
Do we order one off Amazon?
What?

40:59.324 --> 41:01.024
We go to the woods.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.059
Oh.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.104
Well, we have woods
on the property.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.928
[Laughs]
Of course you do.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.129
Well,
I have to go meet

41:06.164 --> 41:07.497
some old high school friends,

41:07.532 --> 41:10.066
but first thing tomorrow,
we are chopping down a tree.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.734
The fact
that I have no idea how?

41:11.770 --> 41:12.702
Totally irrelevant.

41:12.737 --> 41:13.636
I know how.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.438
Of course you do.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.373
You never cease to amaze me,
Lizzie Richfield.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.177
Family dinner
will now be served

41:21.246 --> 41:22.246
in the formal
dining room.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.282
Well, since you're all home,

41:26.318 --> 41:28.238
I thought you might like
to do a family dinner...

41:29.120 --> 41:30.120
To visit...

41:31.389 --> 41:32.789
Catch up?

41:34.626 --> 41:35.837
It's what
my extended family does

41:35.861 --> 41:37.660
when we haven't seen each other
in a while.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.497
So I had Anna prepare
something special,

41:40.565 --> 41:43.066
a holiday meal
with a yule log for dessert.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.769
Don't you just love
a good yule log?

41:48.607 --> 41:50.974
Um... okay.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.009
Yeah, sure.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.178
Why not?

41:55.213 --> 41:55.979
[Anna]: All right.
Please, follow me.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.014
Okay.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.186
[♪♪♪]

42:03.255 --> 42:04.420
Thank you, Anna.

42:05.457 --> 42:06.756
The young gentlemen

42:06.825 --> 42:09.259
thoroughly enjoyed
their hot chocolate,

42:09.294 --> 42:10.627
and they are both sound asleep.

42:10.662 --> 42:11.662
Thank you, Gerard.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.733
[Lizzie]:
This is a yule log.

42:16.768 --> 42:19.969
It's my mother's recipe.
Anna made it.

42:20.005 --> 42:24.207
It is the quintessential
holiday dessert.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.376
Prepare for your world
to be rocked.

42:26.411 --> 42:27.411
[They laugh]

42:27.445 --> 42:28.478
Enjoy.

42:28.513 --> 42:30.713
Wait, you're not
joining us?

42:30.749 --> 42:31.759
Oh, it's a...
It's a family dinner.

42:31.783 --> 42:32.783
I'll eat
with the staff.

42:32.817 --> 42:34.384
Oh, no, no.
No, no, we insist.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.053
Anna, would you
please set a place?

42:37.088 --> 42:38.088
Certainly.

42:38.156 --> 42:39.322
Thank you, Anna.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.891
We're not really
your typical family anyway.

42:41.927 --> 42:45.395
I'm sure Lizzie's
already gathered that.

42:45.463 --> 42:46.996
Join us, please.

42:51.803 --> 42:52.803
I suppose.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.172
Thank you.

42:58.543 --> 43:00.276
Thanks.

43:00.312 --> 43:01.377
All right.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.647
I love this.

43:04.683 --> 43:06.294
My mother and sister and I
do it every week.

43:06.318 --> 43:07.984
Thank you.

43:08.053 --> 43:09.053
Enjoy.

43:11.156 --> 43:12.088
After my father
passed away,

43:12.123 --> 43:13.790
my mother worked
a lot of nights,

43:13.825 --> 43:17.293
but our weekly family dinner
was the one constant.

43:17.329 --> 43:19.262
Mm.

43:19.297 --> 43:23.299
It's nice to catch up
and share stories,

43:23.335 --> 43:24.367
remember the good times,

43:24.436 --> 43:25.580
especially
around the holidays.

43:25.604 --> 43:28.104
I have a holiday memory.

43:28.173 --> 43:30.084
Do you remember when grandfather
used to dress up

43:30.108 --> 43:31.975
like Santa Claus,

43:32.010 --> 43:33.588
and he would sneak past
that window right there

43:33.612 --> 43:35.311
when he knew
that we were at the table?

43:35.347 --> 43:36.347
Yeah,

43:36.381 --> 43:37.680
and kip would start crying.

43:37.749 --> 43:38.581
I would not start crying.

43:38.617 --> 43:39.660
[Robert]:
Oh, no, kip, come on.

43:39.684 --> 43:41.150
No, admit it.
It's all right.

43:41.186 --> 43:42.296
You were afraid of Santa Claus.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.320
Maybe it was one time,

43:43.355 --> 43:45.321
and I was, what,
three years old?

43:45.390 --> 43:47.256
Oh, you were
a lot older than that.

43:47.325 --> 43:48.458
[Kip]:
No!

43:48.493 --> 43:50.460
Definitely older.
You were, like, what, six?

43:50.495 --> 43:51.294
Seven, maybe?

43:51.329 --> 43:52.362
17?

43:52.397 --> 43:54.897
I was not 17!
I was a child.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.177
Oh, emotionally,
you were a child, yes.

43:56.201 --> 43:57.734
Enough, please.

43:57.769 --> 43:58.779
Well, at least
we were all behaving

43:58.803 --> 44:00.014
when we thought
Santa was watching.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.182
[Pippa]: Well, that was
your father's plan,

44:01.206 --> 44:04.607
why he enlisted your grandfather
to do it.

44:04.643 --> 44:07.010
You know, I think I still have
that ratty old costume

44:07.045 --> 44:08.045
somewhere...

44:09.314 --> 44:12.315
Unless that closet
has already been cleaned out.

44:14.352 --> 44:16.552
Nothing has yet.

44:16.588 --> 44:17.765
You'll be able to keep
whatever you'd like,

44:17.789 --> 44:18.789
grandmother.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.135
You know what would be fun?

44:21.159 --> 44:23.693
If we'd get that
old Santa suit out.

44:23.728 --> 44:25.528
Robert could put it
on for the boys.

44:25.563 --> 44:26.729
I don't want
to scare kip.

44:26.798 --> 44:28.598
Ah, just drop it already,
please.

44:28.633 --> 44:31.100
Oh, you must...
For your nephews.

44:31.169 --> 44:34.170
It'll soften the blow of
their father not being here.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.738
Why isn't Jackson here?

44:36.908 --> 44:38.307
He's been unemployed
for so long

44:38.343 --> 44:41.377
that I had to dip
into my trust fund.

44:41.413 --> 44:42.779
But that's what
it's there for,

44:42.847 --> 44:44.013
the rough patches.

44:44.049 --> 44:46.349
But he wants
to provide for his family.

44:46.418 --> 44:48.751
I told him
my money is his money,

44:48.787 --> 44:50.153
but he hates to spend it.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.188
That's why he's not here,

44:52.223 --> 44:54.490
because this house,

44:54.559 --> 44:56.559
it reminds him of everything
that he can't give us.

44:59.531 --> 45:01.397
What...
What can we do?

45:02.901 --> 45:05.101
I wish I knew.

45:05.136 --> 45:06.580
[Pippa]: That's what
we're all here for.

45:06.604 --> 45:09.372
We'll figure this out.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.110
Don't look now, but...

45:14.179 --> 45:17.046
You're kind of acting
like a typical family.

45:28.793 --> 45:29.759
Did you find him?

45:29.794 --> 45:31.561
Mr. kip is still in bed.

45:31.596 --> 45:32.596
He said he was out late

45:32.630 --> 45:34.363
and he, quote,
"needs more sleep,

45:34.399 --> 45:35.698
a lot more sleep.

45:35.734 --> 45:36.933
Come back later."

45:36.968 --> 45:37.968
Unquote.

45:39.370 --> 45:40.370
It's okay,

45:40.405 --> 45:42.371
but I should probably
get going.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.118
We've got deliveries
coming this afternoon.

45:44.142 --> 45:46.709
You can't chop down a tree
by yourself, Lizzie.

45:46.745 --> 45:48.678
I will assist.

45:48.713 --> 45:49.512
[Robert]:
No, Gerard.

45:49.581 --> 45:50.713
I'll go.

45:52.217 --> 45:53.149
If you're sure, sir.

45:53.184 --> 45:55.852
[Lizzie]:
Thank you,

45:55.920 --> 45:57.720
but you might want
to change first.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.690
Why, what's...
What's wrong with this?

46:02.127 --> 46:03.604
You really are a bunch
of indoor people, aren't you?

46:03.628 --> 46:05.228
[Laughs]

46:05.263 --> 46:07.730
You know there are services
that cut down trees for you.

46:07.799 --> 46:09.398
I mean,
we've used them many times.

46:09.434 --> 46:10.533
I know,

46:10.568 --> 46:11.679
but this is the fun part
of Christmas...

46:11.703 --> 46:13.002
Mm.

46:13.037 --> 46:16.239
And you could use
a little more fun, Mr. Marley.

46:16.274 --> 46:17.874
Oh, is that so?

46:17.909 --> 46:19.709
Mm.

46:19.778 --> 46:22.378
Might I suggest clothes
where mud is welcome, sir?

46:22.413 --> 46:23.679
Right.

46:25.717 --> 46:26.849
I'll be back in five.

46:26.918 --> 46:28.284
Okay.

46:30.688 --> 46:33.790
Gerard, do you know
what you just did?

46:33.825 --> 46:35.024
You called me Lizzie!

46:35.059 --> 46:37.393
No "miss,"
no "Richfield,"

46:37.428 --> 46:39.295
not even
the full formal "Elizabeth."

46:39.330 --> 46:41.864
Did I?

46:41.900 --> 46:44.534
We're making
great progress.

46:44.569 --> 46:47.136
Well, I'll go
see to Mr. Robert.

46:53.478 --> 46:56.078
What do you say
we stop right here?

46:56.147 --> 46:57.907
We can grab this tree
and call it a day, huh?

46:59.584 --> 47:01.184
Not big enough.

47:01.219 --> 47:03.486
We're trying to make
a statement with it.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.588
What are we
trying to say?

47:07.358 --> 47:08.825
[Heavy accent]
Welcome.

47:10.361 --> 47:11.661
Is the tree Dracula?

47:11.729 --> 47:14.831
Yeah, I don't know
what that accent was all about,

47:14.866 --> 47:15.998
but the thing is,

47:16.034 --> 47:17.274
it is the first thing
people see

47:17.302 --> 47:18.768
when they walk in the door,
so we...

47:18.803 --> 47:20.703
You know, let's...
Let's greet them properly.

47:20.738 --> 47:22.271
But let's also sit

47:22.307 --> 47:25.641
and see what Anna has
packed us for lunch.

47:25.710 --> 47:27.430
Okay, you eat.
I'm going to look for a tree.

47:29.747 --> 47:30.947
You have a vision, huh?

47:32.784 --> 47:35.785
Yeah. I do.

47:35.820 --> 47:40.056
You know, the last year
has been pretty rough for me.

47:41.626 --> 47:44.894
I kept my head down,
and I got through it,

47:44.929 --> 47:48.030
but then I came to Ashford,

47:48.099 --> 47:50.399
and I... looked up.

47:50.435 --> 47:53.069
That is a very different effect
than Ashford has on most people.

47:54.939 --> 47:56.539
Most people?
Or you?

48:00.979 --> 48:03.145
Before my parents died,
it was a happy place.

48:04.349 --> 48:05.848
Afterwards, not so much.

48:05.884 --> 48:08.417
Well, a home is all
about who fills it.

48:09.888 --> 48:12.822
It must have felt
so empty without them.

48:12.857 --> 48:16.359
Is that why
there's so much friction

48:16.394 --> 48:17.994
between you and Pippa?

48:18.029 --> 48:20.229
I was 13

48:20.265 --> 48:22.565
when my parents
passed away.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.333
Kip and Sloane
were eight and six,

48:24.369 --> 48:26.235
and...

48:26.271 --> 48:28.204
Pippa was overwhelmed.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.205
She had her hands full.

48:29.240 --> 48:30.473
Because of that,

48:30.508 --> 48:31.340
I probably wasn't
the easiest kid

48:31.376 --> 48:32.508
to deal with.

48:32.577 --> 48:33.976
They got very close,

48:34.045 --> 48:37.546
and I became comfortable
being a stranger in my own home.

48:37.615 --> 48:41.517
Perhaps because of that,
I, uh...

48:41.552 --> 48:44.287
Became
a bit rough around the edges.

48:44.322 --> 48:46.856
Well, I find that
hard to believe.

48:46.891 --> 48:48.369
I mean, you know they all
call you Mr. warm and fuzzy

48:48.393 --> 48:49.393
behind your back?

48:50.662 --> 48:51.627
No, they don't.

48:51.663 --> 48:52.862
No, they don't.

48:57.468 --> 49:00.403
So, wait, I had a thought.

49:00.438 --> 49:01.370
About?

49:01.406 --> 49:02.406
That $20 date.

49:03.942 --> 49:05.741
Come on, you said
it's a challenge,

49:05.777 --> 49:07.543
and I never back down
from a challenge.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.378
Okay, let's hear it.

49:09.447 --> 49:11.614
Okay.

49:11.649 --> 49:14.050
So, um...

49:14.085 --> 49:17.019
To start off with, we...
My date and I...

49:17.055 --> 49:21.557
We would go to the pond
behind Ashford at dusk,

49:21.626 --> 49:23.159
and from there,

49:23.227 --> 49:24.238
we'd watch
the sun disappear

49:24.262 --> 49:26.195
behind the mountains.

49:26.230 --> 49:27.463
That would cost
nothing.

49:28.866 --> 49:32.034
Then we'd listen to
my mom's favorite song

49:32.070 --> 49:33.280
on the record player
in the library.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.271
A record?

49:35.306 --> 49:37.239
Yeah, you know,
an LP.

49:37.275 --> 49:38.874
No, I know what it is.
I just...

49:38.910 --> 49:39.910
Forget it.
Keep going.

49:39.944 --> 49:42.111
Okay.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.380
Then I'd plug the
Christmas lights in,

49:44.415 --> 49:45.615
so that would be
the only light

49:45.650 --> 49:47.283
illuminating us.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.418
I'd twirl her around
a little bit.

49:49.454 --> 49:51.487
So if we're talking
five senses,

49:51.522 --> 49:53.255
that covers
sight and sound.

49:53.291 --> 49:55.858
For taste,
I'd make her dinner

49:55.893 --> 49:57.927
using only $20 worth
of ingredients.

49:57.996 --> 49:58.861
Given that
it's the holidays,

49:58.896 --> 50:00.596
perhaps a yule log.

50:00.631 --> 50:02.031
That's my favorite entree.

50:02.066 --> 50:03.066
Oh.

50:05.003 --> 50:07.903
Then we'd walk
to the solarium,

50:07.939 --> 50:10.973
and I'd pick her
a white rose.

50:12.477 --> 50:13.477
Smell.

50:14.779 --> 50:16.545
Then we'd walk back,

50:16.581 --> 50:19.115
and I'd take her hand.

50:19.150 --> 50:20.150
Touch.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.021
What was your mother's
favorite song?

50:26.457 --> 50:28.257
Silver bells.

50:28.292 --> 50:31.093
It always signified that
Christmas had arrived.

50:31.129 --> 50:33.429
I had no idea
when I chose that theme.

50:33.464 --> 50:35.364
I know,

50:35.400 --> 50:37.166
but it's okay.

50:37.201 --> 50:38.501
It's a good thing.

50:40.738 --> 50:42.204
Well, you...

50:42.240 --> 50:44.340
You certainly know
how to rise to a challenge.

50:44.409 --> 50:46.142
Mm, it's a good challenge.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.744
But I... I couldn't
help but notice

50:48.813 --> 50:54.183
that it all takes place
at Ashford,

50:54.218 --> 50:56.752
which you seem so eager
to escape.

50:56.788 --> 50:57.788
Hmm.

50:59.424 --> 51:01.791
I know it was a sad place
for a long time,

51:01.826 --> 51:04.060
but it's okay
to like it again.

51:05.797 --> 51:08.030
You can...

51:08.066 --> 51:10.232
Look up too.

51:12.737 --> 51:14.036
Oh, there you are.

51:14.072 --> 51:15.616
I should have known
you'd take her to the bench.

51:15.640 --> 51:16.683
I had a rough night,
but I rallied.

51:16.707 --> 51:17.573
I hope I didn't
let you down.

51:17.608 --> 51:18.608
No, no, no.

51:18.676 --> 51:20.342
We actually have not
found the tree yet.

51:20.378 --> 51:22.058
What do you mean?
You walked right past it.

51:22.980 --> 51:24.046
Look at this thing.

51:24.082 --> 51:25.381
It's perfect.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.284
I mean, we wanted
to make a statement, right?

51:28.319 --> 51:30.753
Yeah...
You're right.

51:32.557 --> 51:33.522
That's the one.

51:33.558 --> 51:34.323
That's gorgeous.

51:34.358 --> 51:35.591
Yeah!

51:35.626 --> 51:37.526
It's a good thing
you came along when you did.

51:37.562 --> 51:38.794
Yeah, it was a good thing.

51:38.830 --> 51:41.464
Ah, here, big bro,
I will, uh...

51:41.499 --> 51:42.499
Oh yeah...

51:43.367 --> 51:44.567
Show you how it's done.

51:44.635 --> 51:46.435
Can't wait.

52:00.585 --> 52:02.384
Sorry, I didn't know
anyone was in here.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.413
Oh no, I'm just wrapping
some gifts for the staff.

52:05.356 --> 52:06.689
Do you want some help?

52:06.724 --> 52:08.724
I'd love some.

52:08.793 --> 52:10.626
Sloane,
are you okay?

52:10.661 --> 52:12.027
[Tearful]
Yeah.

52:12.063 --> 52:13.362
[Sniffs]

52:13.397 --> 52:15.437
Jackson didn't get this job
that looked promising...

52:16.300 --> 52:19.401
And he really doesn't want
to come here for Christmas,

52:19.437 --> 52:22.104
and he's stressing
about presents for the boys.

52:22.140 --> 52:23.906
And what is it
that you want?

52:23.941 --> 52:25.975
I don't even care
about presents.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.510
I just want my family
together

52:27.545 --> 52:28.822
in a place where we used
to celebrate Christmas

52:28.846 --> 52:31.580
with my parents.

52:31.616 --> 52:33.949
This is going to be our
last one ever at Ashford.

52:36.454 --> 52:40.055
The Christmas spirit
costs nothing.

52:40.124 --> 52:41.624
You know what?

52:41.659 --> 52:44.727
Homemade gifts are
even more special.

52:44.762 --> 52:46.195
What matters is
being together.

52:48.266 --> 52:49.999
Hey...

52:50.034 --> 52:51.845
How about we put a moratorium
on store-bought gifts

52:51.869 --> 52:52.869
this year?

52:52.937 --> 52:55.137
Everything
must be homemade.

52:55.206 --> 52:56.372
That could work.

52:56.407 --> 52:59.175
Fight for your husband, Sloane.

52:59.210 --> 53:01.110
I know you can come up
with a compromise.

53:01.145 --> 53:02.044
You know, and I
can watch the boys

53:02.079 --> 53:03.345
until you get back.

53:03.381 --> 53:05.281
I worked my way through
college as a nanny.

53:05.316 --> 53:06.248
And I'll help too.

53:06.284 --> 53:07.550
[Both]: You will?

53:07.585 --> 53:08.585
Yes.

53:08.619 --> 53:09.752
Why are you guys so shocked?

53:09.820 --> 53:11.754
I can take care of kids.

53:13.057 --> 53:14.390
Go back to D.C.,

53:14.425 --> 53:16.325
and bring your husband home
for Christmas.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.327
Okay.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.196
I'm going to go look
at train schedules.

53:28.339 --> 53:29.579
You know, don't worry.
I... I...

53:29.640 --> 53:30.918
You know, I know
a little bit more about kids

53:30.942 --> 53:31.740
than I do
about chopping down trees.

53:31.776 --> 53:32.641
Oh yeah?

53:32.710 --> 53:33.676
Just a little
bit more?

53:33.711 --> 53:34.843
Just a little bit more.

53:34.879 --> 53:35.678
Little more... yeah,
we're in big trouble.

53:35.713 --> 53:38.113
[Laughing]

53:41.552 --> 53:44.353
You guys have been so
good since your mom left.

53:44.388 --> 53:47.423
I emailed Santa,
and guess what?

53:47.491 --> 53:48.457
He's watching.

53:48.492 --> 53:49.525
[Boy]:
You think so?

53:49.594 --> 53:50.960
I know so.

53:52.296 --> 53:53.162
You guys ready?

53:53.197 --> 53:54.463
[Boys]:
Yes!

53:54.498 --> 53:55.998
- Ready for what?
- I don't know.

53:56.033 --> 53:57.766
[Robert]:
Um...

53:57.802 --> 53:58.634
Ready for this!

53:58.703 --> 54:00.069
I'm going to get you!

54:00.104 --> 54:00.970
Ha ha!

54:01.005 --> 54:01.770
Hey!

54:01.806 --> 54:03.072
Oh no!

54:03.107 --> 54:04.940
You know, I can email Santa
back, you know,

54:04.976 --> 54:07.443
tell him you've changed
into a bunch of mean meanies.

54:07.478 --> 54:08.655
She wouldn't dare.
She's bluffing!

54:08.679 --> 54:09.745
Get her!

54:09.780 --> 54:10.713
Yeah!

54:10.748 --> 54:11.892
No, no!
Hey, what's going on here?

54:11.916 --> 54:12.881
Oh, my God!

54:12.917 --> 54:13.716
[Lizzie]:
Look what you've created!

54:13.784 --> 54:15.918
My monsters turned against me!

54:15.953 --> 54:17.353
[Laughs]

54:17.388 --> 54:18.887
You're not supposed
to hit me!

54:18.923 --> 54:20.522
[Robert]:
Oh no!

54:20.558 --> 54:21.490
I'm sorry.

54:21.525 --> 54:22.525
Oh, I got him. Yes!

54:22.560 --> 54:24.226
[Cheering, yelling]

54:24.262 --> 54:26.462
[Robert]:
He's a sharp-shooter.

54:26.497 --> 54:29.531
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't gang up on me.

54:29.567 --> 54:30.399
Ah!

54:30.434 --> 54:31.900
[♪♪♪]

54:41.078 --> 54:44.079
I'm going to write "daddy"
on the roof in candy.

54:44.148 --> 54:45.848
[Laughs]

54:45.883 --> 54:46.893
I think this is going
to be the best present

54:46.917 --> 54:48.417
he's ever gotten.

54:48.452 --> 54:49.918
And mine will be
the best too.

54:49.987 --> 54:51.353
[They laugh]

54:51.389 --> 54:52.833
Well, you can never have
too many gingerbread houses,

54:52.857 --> 54:53.956
trust me.

54:53.991 --> 54:55.758
I think I'm going
to go two stories.

54:57.395 --> 54:58.427
Oh yeah?

54:58.462 --> 54:59.462
Is that a challenge?

55:01.098 --> 55:01.764
Because I can
go condo.

55:01.799 --> 55:02.998
Mm.

55:03.034 --> 55:05.601
Multi-unit gingerbread house
with a low H.O.A.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.237
[Robert]: So, guys,
when Lizzie gets back,

55:08.272 --> 55:09.316
we're going to make
some necklaces for your mom

55:09.340 --> 55:10.639
using some beads
we found

55:10.675 --> 55:12.808
in your great-grandma's
sewing kit.

55:12.877 --> 55:13.877
Cool.

55:15.012 --> 55:16.679
Whoa, wow.

55:16.714 --> 55:18.647
Aren't you and Lizzie
just the cleavers?

55:18.683 --> 55:22.318
A snowman and craft kits
and now necklaces?

55:23.587 --> 55:24.631
I'm helping out
our sister, kip.

55:24.655 --> 55:25.487
That's all.

55:25.556 --> 55:26.588
Oh, that's good.

55:26.624 --> 55:28.791
Then you won't mind
if I ask Lizzie

55:28.826 --> 55:31.327
to go to Athens with me
after the holidays.

55:34.031 --> 55:35.142
Does she want to go to Athens?

55:35.166 --> 55:36.999
Bro, who doesn't want
to go to Athens?

55:37.068 --> 55:38.268
Look, you and Lizzie aren't...

55:39.704 --> 55:40.704
What?

55:42.473 --> 55:44.440
Things are looking up
for her...

55:44.475 --> 55:45.541
After a very tough time.

55:47.211 --> 55:48.811
She needs to be surrounded
by people...

55:48.846 --> 55:49.978
By... who?

55:52.350 --> 55:53.350
By you?

55:53.384 --> 55:55.851
By people who care about her.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.553
People who understand her.

55:57.588 --> 55:59.822
Well, I think
Lizzie needs to be inspired,

55:59.857 --> 56:02.725
and I'm willing to give
her that inspiration.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.194
You just want to win, kip.

56:05.229 --> 56:06.895
That's all you've ever wanted
is the win.

56:06.964 --> 56:08.931
Will you just give me
a little bit of credit here?

56:08.966 --> 56:10.766
Okay, maybe at one point,
that was true,

56:10.835 --> 56:12.368
but I'm not a monster.

56:12.403 --> 56:14.303
I actually...

56:14.338 --> 56:15.437
[Sighs]

56:15.473 --> 56:17.973
I actually think
this might be... real.

56:18.008 --> 56:19.341
[Scoffs]

56:22.079 --> 56:23.079
I just don't see it...

56:24.515 --> 56:26.615
The two of you
together.

56:26.650 --> 56:30.219
Well, it's a good thing
that you don't have to.

56:33.591 --> 56:34.591
[Knocking]

56:40.631 --> 56:42.498
Yes?

56:42.533 --> 56:44.066
Um, I'm sorry if
this is a bad time.

56:44.135 --> 56:45.267
I can...

56:45.302 --> 56:47.436
Come in.

56:49.073 --> 56:52.341
I, uh, I came to
find that Santa suit

56:52.410 --> 56:54.710
to surprise the boys.

56:54.745 --> 56:56.812
Christmas
is very important to you.

56:59.417 --> 57:00.749
It was my father's favorite,

57:00.785 --> 57:02.317
and now,

57:02.353 --> 57:03.986
during the
holidays,

57:04.021 --> 57:06.355
I... I can feel him

57:06.390 --> 57:08.157
more than at other
times of the year.

57:08.192 --> 57:11.493
That's probably why
I go so overboard.

57:11.562 --> 57:13.529
Loving it as much as he did

57:13.564 --> 57:16.999
is how I keep him with me.

57:17.034 --> 57:20.536
My late husband, Bernard,

57:20.571 --> 57:22.704
the gala
was his favorite night.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.807
That's why it is
so important to me

57:24.875 --> 57:26.909
that this last one
is perfect.

57:30.181 --> 57:34.049
I will do everything I can
to make sure that it is.

57:37.488 --> 57:39.488
What will you be wearing?

57:39.523 --> 57:41.757
Oh, I brought a nice dress.

57:41.792 --> 57:43.592
Unacceptable.
You need a gown.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.360
The local boutique

57:45.396 --> 57:47.396
is sending me some options
this afternoon.

57:47.431 --> 57:49.151
I'll have them pull dresses
for you as well.

57:50.801 --> 57:52.734
We'll find you
an appropriate one.

57:53.838 --> 57:55.237
I appreciate that.

57:57.408 --> 57:58.807
Gerard!

58:02.480 --> 58:04.046
[♪♪♪]

58:10.287 --> 58:11.320
Hmm.

58:11.355 --> 58:13.088
That one would do.

58:15.059 --> 58:16.692
It's... beautiful.

58:16.727 --> 58:18.460
But I like
the first one better,

58:18.496 --> 58:21.096
and I will lend you
a diamond necklace.

58:22.433 --> 58:23.365
Thank you.

58:23.400 --> 58:25.100
[Chuckles]

58:29.673 --> 58:33.308
What do you think
of my grandson?

58:33.344 --> 58:34.743
Which one?
You have two.

58:34.778 --> 58:36.578
Ha, I'm aware of that.

58:36.647 --> 58:37.679
I'm speaking of the one

58:37.715 --> 58:39.181
who has piqued
your interest.

58:40.384 --> 58:42.818
Oh, that was not a date.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.953
It was a dinner
for the gala.

58:44.989 --> 58:46.700
It was actually a tasting
that kip had, like...

58:46.724 --> 58:48.657
Oh, so it is kip
who has piqued your interest?

58:48.692 --> 58:49.892
Yes.

58:49.960 --> 58:51.260
Uh, no. I mean no.
I... I mean...

58:51.295 --> 58:53.362
I mean, they both have.

58:53.397 --> 58:55.397
You know, they...
Everyone has.

58:55.466 --> 58:58.967
I have grown very fond
of your whole family.

58:59.036 --> 59:01.069
And they of you.

59:01.105 --> 59:02.304
Hmm.

59:02.339 --> 59:05.107
Let me tell you something
about my grandsons.

59:05.142 --> 59:06.575
I love them both dearly,

59:06.610 --> 59:09.645
but the differences
are quite monumental.

59:10.881 --> 59:12.014
That's evident.

59:12.049 --> 59:15.651
One is driven by conquest
and satisfaction,

59:15.686 --> 59:18.754
while the other is driven
by duty and responsibility,

59:18.789 --> 59:22.090
and they are both wrong...
And right...

59:22.126 --> 59:24.893
But I think that's why
they're always at odds.

59:24.929 --> 59:27.963
They would each do well
to be more like the other...

59:27.998 --> 59:30.899
Kip to stay in one place,
and Robert to let go,

59:30.935 --> 59:33.035
but I do think

59:33.070 --> 59:34.748
you've had quite an effect
on both of them.

59:34.772 --> 59:38.206
Well, I did get them
to cut down a tree in the woods.

59:38.242 --> 59:39.207
[Laughs]

59:39.243 --> 59:40.776
A shock to us all.

59:40.811 --> 59:42.210
[Laughs]

59:42.246 --> 59:44.513
But seeing
what being around you

59:44.548 --> 59:46.348
has done to Robert

59:46.383 --> 59:47.583
is quite substantial.

59:47.618 --> 59:49.151
What does it do to him?

59:50.187 --> 59:51.153
He's awake.

59:51.188 --> 59:52.888
There comes a time

59:52.957 --> 59:54.790
when our foundation
is shaken

59:54.825 --> 59:57.192
in transformative ways.

59:57.227 --> 59:59.861
For me, it's leaving Ashford.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.597
For him...

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:02.872
I believe
it's finding it again.

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:09.338
You know,
Robert told me

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:10.706
it was your
doctor's decision...

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:12.507
Why you have to move.

01:00:12.576 --> 01:00:14.443
Well, that's quite true.

01:00:14.478 --> 01:00:15.944
You know,

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:20.048
something I learned
when my foundation was shaken...

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.017
It's not always a bad thing.

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:29.691
Yes, I do believe your presence
has had an impact on us all.

01:00:34.331 --> 01:00:36.632
Definitely the first dress.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.306
[Kip]:
Coconut, coc

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.273
crack!

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:46.708
I'm going to crack
all of you,

01:00:46.744 --> 01:00:47.576
because it's dinner
time, all right?

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:48.543
You sit down.

01:00:48.612 --> 01:00:50.012
Let's fly you into here.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.580
Oh, there we go.

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:52.547
Oh, look who it is!

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:53.882
Daddy!

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:56.318
Aw, hey, guys.

01:00:56.387 --> 01:00:57.387
[Boy]: We made
you gifts!

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:58.887
I heard,
and I made you some too.

01:00:58.922 --> 01:01:00.122
Yay!

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:01.023
[Kip]: It's good to see you,
Jackson.

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:02.924
[High fives]

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.359
Jackson.

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:07.262
Oh, so wonderful
that you could make it.

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:15.070
[♪♪♪]

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.573
This is good.
It feels great.

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:20.375
Well,
it's been too long.

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:22.110
[Bells ring]

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:23.786
[Lizzie]: What was that?
Do you hear that?

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.415
[Gasps]
Look!

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.749
- Whoa!
- Who's that?

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:29.217
It's Santa Claus!

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.732
He's watching!
You said he was watching.

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:34.890
I guess he is.

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:36.491
[Laughing]

01:01:36.527 --> 01:01:38.060
Pretty cool,
guys, huh?

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.327
Yes, pretty cool indeed.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:40.363
[Chuckles]

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.065
You're not joining us?

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.833
Oh, with Jackson here,

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.802
it feels
like it should be just family.

01:01:46.837 --> 01:01:48.503
Nonsense.
You are family.

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:49.871
Sit.

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:53.443
Thanks.

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:54.576
Of course.

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:59.314
There you are.

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:01.684
[Clearing throat]

01:02:02.953 --> 01:02:03.953
[Kip]:
There he is.

01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:06.621
Hey. Sorry,
that was a long call.

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:07.690
Did I miss anything?

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:08.690
Santa was here!

01:02:08.726 --> 01:02:09.624
What?
Where?

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.859
There!

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:11.827
I missed him.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.361
[Laughter]

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:14.708
Okay, can we eat?
Because I'm starving.

01:02:14.732 --> 01:02:15.964
[Laughter]

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.480
Good morning.

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:32.581
Good morning.

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:34.683
Happy Christmas Eve.

01:02:34.718 --> 01:02:36.485
Happy Christmas Eve.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.420
[Lizzie]:
big day today.

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:41.423
I just wanted to center myself
for a few minutes,

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:43.492
the calm before the storm.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.260
The party's going
to be great.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:46.561
Oh, please.

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:48.630
Oh, thank you.

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:49.798
Of course.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:03.823
It's been so long
since I've been out here,

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:06.381
I've forgotten
how much I love it.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.383
The mountains,

01:03:08.418 --> 01:03:10.652
the pond,
everything.

01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:14.256
In fact,
it's been years

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.892
since I've been
to Ashford at all.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.627
Um...

01:03:18.662 --> 01:03:19.839
But lately,
I've been seeing it

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:20.796
through fresh eyes.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.831
I've been looking up.

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:26.835
Well, that's because
you came home for Christmas.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:28.848
You know, the holidays
have that effect on people.

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:31.106
No, Lizzie,
it's not Christmas, it's you.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.112
Look, I know that technically,
you work for us,

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.580
but there's something
I want to say.

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:42.517
Since you arrived
here, I've...

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:43.553
There you are!

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:47.889
They told me
you'd be out here.

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:50.325
You're not answering your phone.
I tried calling 10 times.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.060
Oh yeah, I left
it up at the house.

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:54.062
Mm.

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:56.131
Counter accepted.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.400
Ashford estate
is officially in escrow.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.543
Anna,

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:09.789
are the appetizers
in process yet?

01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:10.946
Yes, absolutely.

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:12.614
Great.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.316
Oh, look at you,

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.495
and you don't even
need a ladder.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.219
Nope.

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:19.387
Thank you, all of you,
for helping so much.

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:20.856
Note to self,

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:22.958
10% more staffers
next time.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:24.226
Next time?

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:26.161
If I choose

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.629
to throw another party
anywhere.

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:33.442
I'm glad
you've decided to come home.

01:04:35.339 --> 01:04:36.339
Me too, grandmother.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:39.341
Oh...

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:42.244
My wonderful
great-grandchildren.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:43.211
[Lizzie]:
Yeah, nice bows, guys.

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:44.813
Really good work.

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:46.648
[Whispering] Don't worry,
I'll fix it.

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:47.582
Thank you.

01:04:47.618 --> 01:04:48.450
[Whispering]
I'll help.

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:50.518
Thank you.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:51.419
Did you see the listing
I sent you

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:52.687
for that lovely house?

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:55.390
Uh, Gerard will be taking me by
next week.

01:04:55.425 --> 01:04:56.224
Oh, good.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.192
It's rather small.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:00.629
It's almost
4,000 square feet.

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:02.697
That's true.

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:04.633
It would be an adjustment,

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:07.636
but at least
there's room for my art.

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.671
Well, some of it.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.906
Well, that's the idea,

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:13.408
so you can bring Ashford
with you.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:15.777
We should all be surrounded
by the beauty that inspires us.

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.879
The hair
and makeup people

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:18.980
are upstairs, ma'am.

01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:20.749
Perhaps it's time
to go get ready...

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:23.018
Both of you.

01:05:23.053 --> 01:05:23.952
Go. We can finish
up from here.

01:05:23.987 --> 01:05:24.853
Really?

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:25.887
- Yeah.
- Hey, yeah...

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:27.166
No, we can definitely
get it done.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:28.301
I could be ready
for the Oscars

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:30.025
in 15 minutes,

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.661
and actually, uh,
I kind of did that once.

01:05:32.729 --> 01:05:33.862
Oh, and hey,

01:05:33.897 --> 01:05:35.017
will you save a dance
for me?

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:37.466
Sure.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.237
Thank you for
all you do, Gerard.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.974
My pleasure, ma'am.

Hi. Kip Marley.

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.520

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:08.129
Exquisite.

that dance now?

someone you need to meet.

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:24.446
Don, right now?

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:25.480
I just...
One minute.

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.115
Yeah.

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:30.618
Mom! Meg! Hi!

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:31.653
Merry Christmas!

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:34.522
Oh, merry
Christmas, honey.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:36.591
Merry Christmas.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:37.759
Nice party,

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:38.893
and everyone
is saying

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:41.463
it's the best gala
they've ever been to.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:42.764
Oh...

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.077
I'm just happy that we can
all be together tonight...

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:45.300
Mm-hmm.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.168

the most incredible house

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:48.570
I've ever seen.

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:49.337
Yeah, you just had
to make us work

01:06:49.373 --> 01:06:50.739
on Christmas Eve.

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:53.775
Um, you begged to come to work
with me on Christmas Eve.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:55.043
I know,

01:06:55.078 --> 01:06:56.511
and I'm not
complaining.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:58.113
It's a really wonderful
party, Lizzie.

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:02.183
Um, mom, this is kip Marley,
and you know my sister, Megan.

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:03.629
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Richfield.

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:04.853
And you as well.

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:07.122
Your daughter is...

01:07:07.157 --> 01:07:08.390
Well,
she's something else.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.657
Uh, they both are.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:12.494
Yes, they are.
They certainly are.

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:14.262
I can see

01:07:14.297 --> 01:07:17.298
why planning this
has been such a joy for you.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:18.400
Well, go.

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:20.235
Enjoy yourself,
enjoy your party.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.470
We promise to
as well, okay?

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:34.049
You look incredible!

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:36.451
Aw, thank you.
Courtesy of your grandmother.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.153
Oh, no, no, no,
it's you, Lizzie.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:39.354
It's always you.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.389
Kip, could you help
your old grandmother?

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:43.158
I have to greet
the Kents,

01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:44.392
and would like
to do that

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:45.828
with my handsome
grandson on my arm.

01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:49.197
Well, I can't say no to Pippa.

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:50.266
Uh, don't go anywhere?

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.901
I can't anyway.
I'm on the clock.

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:55.136
Right.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.274
I thought
he'd never leave.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:00.642
Oh!

This whole house
feels alive again.

01:08:34.544 --> 01:08:37.045
Maybe it's not the house.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:39.548
Maybe it's you.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:43.551
Uh, I was thinking...

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:44.964
[Kip]: Hey, uh, excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt,

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:47.287
but, uh, there's an emergency.
Pippa needs you outside.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.234
There's something going on
with the desserts, I don't know.

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:50.259
Oh, okay.

Pippa shouldn't
be out here.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.649
It's too cold.

I'm the one who
wanted to talk to you.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.968
I've been doing
a lot of thinking these days.

I know that some
people inside

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.448

that's a dangerous idea.

a life that inspires you...

To see the world

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.750
through the artistic expression
of ancient civilizations.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.720

Come to Athens with me.

01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:17.478
It won't cost you a dime.

Now, I know that
I'm a bit of a nomad.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.217

in a little bit of a
faster Lane than most,

changed in me

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.124
since you got here.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.961
There's a light inside you,
Lizzie,

and I don't even know
if you realize it.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:39.634
When you're around anyone,
you...

01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:40.703
You make them better,

around them.

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:46.976
settling down

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:48.810

to run and hide.

But my heart belongs
to someone else.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:39.861
I think

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:41.663
I just realized that tonight.

01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:46.701
I'm sorry.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:49.103

I just want you...

job here.

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.065

That really means a lot to me.

01:12:51.101 --> 01:12:52.700

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:55.837
Small, intimate,

01:12:55.905 --> 01:12:57.105
only 200 people,

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.540
and I would love
to retain your services.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:03.578
To plan it.

01:13:03.613 --> 01:13:05.279
You do plan parties,
don't you?

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:07.448

magnificent ones around.

I believe that.

What did I tell you?

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:24.165
Sometimes your
thing finds you.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:32.788
Robert, where
are you going?

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:35.710
I'm going
back to the city.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:36.978
Why?

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:38.980
Because there's nothing
left for me here, Sloane.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:40.882
Don't go.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.750

in years.

We're all just starting
to find each other.

the sale from D.C.

Have either of you seen Robert?

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:09.188
All we know
is that he left,

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:10.945
and kip is holed up
in his room

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.380
and doesn't want
to talk to anyone.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.416
Well, that's probably my fault.

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:19.520
Everything was going so well.

01:14:19.556 --> 01:14:21.422
We were together.

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:24.759
Why would Robert leave
without saying anything?

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.962
Evidently,
his work here was done.

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:29.096
That's what he told Sloane.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.734
Go home, Lizzie.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.603
Spend the rest of your Christmas

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:36.938
with your mother
and your sister.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:38.584
I'm sure they'd rather be home
tonight anyway.

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:40.808
No, I don't want
to leave you alone.

01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:43.478
Sloane and Jackson
and the two boys are here.

01:14:43.546 --> 01:14:44.879
We'll have Christmas together.

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:46.314
But there's so much to be done.

01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:48.149
Cleaning up
after the party, and...

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:49.817
Gerard and I
will take care of it.

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:52.353
Everyone should be
with their family

01:14:52.388 --> 01:14:54.422
on Christmas.

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:15.076
[Fire crackling]

01:15:18.615 --> 01:15:20.326
I left him two messages
saying I need to talk to him.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:21.350
No response.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:26.087
Last night, everything
seemed so clear.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:28.689
The job and Robert...

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.158
It felt
like something was happening.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.760
You know,

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:34.962
he was different
the past few weeks...

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:36.397
In a good way, I mean.

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:38.165
You know,
I let myself get too close.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:39.481
I got caught up
in their world...

01:15:45.108 --> 01:15:46.874
But this is me.

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:50.478
Here is where I belong.

01:15:50.513 --> 01:15:53.514
And who knows
what the future holds?

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:54.849
And now you've seen
what happens

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.151
when you're open
to all the possibilities.

01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:00.187
Yes, you found
yourself there, Lizzie.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:01.223
You found your thing.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:04.191
"Events by Lizzie."

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:06.227
[Laughs]

01:16:06.262 --> 01:16:07.573
It doesn't have
a terrible ring to it.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:09.463
It's all happening.

01:16:10.433 --> 01:16:11.433
So...

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:15.303
Maybe try calling him again.

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:28.950

Grandmother.

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:45.933
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:16:45.969 --> 01:16:47.435
It's Christmas.

01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:49.303
Don't families see each
other on Christmas?

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:51.706
You're a hard
one to find.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:55.509
My first mistake was not
checking your office.

01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:56.677
No rest for
the weary.

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:58.579
Hmm.

01:16:58.615 --> 01:17:00.448
I'll go take a walk, ma'am.

01:17:00.516 --> 01:17:02.383
Call when she's ready
for me to come get her.

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:19.266
When you get to be my age,
Robert,

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:24.271
you start to consider,
what will my legacy be?

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:26.027
We never want to be defined
by our mistakes.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:30.011
After the accident,

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:33.481
I went from weekend grandmother
to single guardian of three

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:34.615
in the blink of an eye.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.083
You did the best you could.

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:38.252
I could have done better
by you.

01:17:39.155 --> 01:17:40.488
Well...

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:43.758
But these past few weeks,
seeing how you've changed,

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:45.826
I wish I hadn't
let you shut down.

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:48.362
It should have been my job
to open you up...

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:52.667
But I didn't do it.

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:53.702
Lizzie did.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.617
It doesn't matter,
grandmother.

01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:00.808
She chose kip.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.309
[Sighs]

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.245
Dear boy.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:12.953
I love your brother
with all my heart,

01:18:12.989 --> 01:18:15.956
but Lizzie
would have never chosen kip.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.358
What are you talking about?

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:20.294
Your brother got on a plane
to Greece this morning...

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:22.530
Alone.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.300
She didn't go with him?

01:18:28.604 --> 01:18:30.538
This was under
the tree this morning,

01:18:30.573 --> 01:18:32.940
with your name on it.

01:18:35.178 --> 01:18:36.178
Open it.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:43.318
It's from Lizzie.

01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:55.062
Oh...

01:18:57.734 --> 01:19:00.935
Tell Gerard
that I'm ready to go,

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:02.536
since you have places to be.

01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:08.876
Mwah!

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.015

[Doorbell rings]

01:19:21.324 --> 01:19:22.289
Who could that be?

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.725
Oh, well,
maybe it's Santa Claus

01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:26.494
because he forgot
to bring me something,

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:28.195
like the love of my life.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:33.834
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:36.103
Can I talk to you?

01:19:36.139 --> 01:19:37.538
- Alone?
- Yeah.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.946
Why did you leave
last night

01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:47.848
without saying goodbye?

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.952
I saw you with kip...

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:55.289
And I made an assumption.

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:58.192
It was more
than that. I...

01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:01.428
Being at Ashford
suddenly felt right,

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:05.299
and that is a very
foreign feeling to me.

01:20:05.334 --> 01:20:08.869
A home isn't just
a house, right?

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:11.705
It's about
the people who fill it,

01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:15.176
and it only felt right again
when you were there.

01:20:17.713 --> 01:20:19.313
I've decided
not to sell Ashford.

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:20.214
What?

01:20:20.249 --> 01:20:21.115
I'm sorry, Megan.

01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:22.316
I really am.

01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:23.050
There will be penalties,
Robert.

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:24.318
I understand,

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:25.964
and I will have other work
for you, I promise.

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:28.856
Sorry, she's kind of
emotional about work.

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:30.324
I can see that.

01:20:31.961 --> 01:20:35.629
The house needs to stay
in the Marley family.

01:20:35.665 --> 01:20:36.997
It's just a matter
of filling it

01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:39.300
with the right people...

01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:41.468
Whenever
that might happen.

more Christmases

I found myself at Ashford,

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:05.459
not because of the grandeur
or finding my passion...

01:21:07.563 --> 01:21:08.563
But because of you.

01:21:10.399 --> 01:21:13.033
I looked up...

01:21:13.069 --> 01:21:14.368

for you too.

with my family.
