WEBVTT

00:01.388 --> 00:03.028
Okay, you know what we're not
going to do?

00:03.053 --> 00:05.486
We're not going to shoot one of those
videos where we watch people die.

00:05.540 --> 00:10.943
Your father, how he loved to
see me get out of his car.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.855
Thank you for staying.

00:13.889 --> 00:14.989
Expecting somebody?

00:15.016 --> 00:16.383
Uh, no.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.318
Wrong address.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.287
And I know you are not
selling drugs

00:21.322 --> 00:22.355
out of this house.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.024
You know I'd never
do anything like that.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.926
I can meet you somewhere for a drink
unless you're meeting someone.

00:26.961 --> 00:28.028
Yeah, yeah, I am.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.131
- I'm sorry for hurting you.
- You said that.

00:31.165 --> 00:34.134
But I've never said
I'm filing for divorce.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.602
I told Avery today.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.409
That's not how it happened.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.777
You totally pursued me.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.278
You obviously knew who I was.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.780
Well, I watch CNN.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.481
Whatever.

00:48.516 --> 00:50.183
You really feeling
yourself, huh?

00:50.217 --> 00:52.952
I am on practically every
billboard around town.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.587
Come on now, let's be real.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.089
You would be at the gym,

00:56.123 --> 00:59.592
exercising and arching
your back just so

00:59.627 --> 01:01.127
you could
throw it all in my face.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.362
You know you were
feeling me first.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.131
I was not arching
my back in the gym.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.366
Who does that?

01:07.702 --> 01:09.803
Okay, maybe I did a little bit.
Yeah, exactly.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.738
It worked.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.107
You didn't tell me you were
married, though.

01:14.141 --> 01:15.408
Yeah, about that.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.011
I was too busy
watching your arch.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.013
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.282
So you like the place?

01:22.316 --> 01:25.418
I mean, it's not done.
It will be done.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.822
Isn't that cool?

01:31.826 --> 01:33.460
That's what I wake up
to every morning.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.595
I always wanted a loft.

01:35.629 --> 01:39.032
And now you can stay over
at my place for a change.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.468
That'll be nice.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.002
I'd like that.

01:43.037 --> 01:44.637
How much you like it?

01:47.174 --> 01:48.942
How much?
Show me how much.

01:50.745 --> 01:52.145
Oh, that much?

01:52.179 --> 01:54.280
Kind of like this.
Kind of like that?

01:55.416 --> 01:56.483
Come back.

01:57.718 --> 01:58.952
Knock, knock!

01:58.986 --> 02:01.588
Hey, up here, up here.
We're all here?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.890
Mr. Daniels,
nice to see you.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.192
Good to see you too, Leanne.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.494
Watch your step.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.595
Thank you.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.631
Somebody I want you to meet.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.733
Uh, this is my lovely lady.

02:13.768 --> 02:15.568
Mary Jane, this is Leanne.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.903
Hi, a pleasure to meet you.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.037
I love your show.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.506
Oh, thank you.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.741
So the place is ready, right?

02:21.776 --> 02:23.510
I'm itching to move in.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.613
Unfortunately, it's not going
to be ready for another month.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.983
What happened to
around-the-clock?

02:30.017 --> 02:31.618
We were good in a week.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.386
Well, I do have a couple of
other vacancies

02:33.420 --> 02:35.121
coming up next month
that fit your specs.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.856
Oh, next month is no good.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.458
You're killing me, Leanne.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.293
Don't worry, Dre,
you'll find something.

02:42.263 --> 02:45.064
Can we, uh, have a moment?

02:45.099 --> 02:46.266
Oh, sure.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.134
Okay, appreciate it.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.842
It doesn't work, babe.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.443
I told her I need to
move out now.

02:59.180 --> 03:03.082
It means I'd have to stay in a
hotel, which I guess I could do.

03:04.428 --> 03:05.828
You're not going to
stay at a hotel.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.354
You'll stay with me
until this place is finished.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.891
She said a month.

03:11.926 --> 03:14.561
You sure?
I'm sure.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.529
This is what you want.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.600
Maybe I did
flirt with you first.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.436
You're too good for me.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.617
I got chips and the wine.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.885
I've got the glasses.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.153
And I like your onesie.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.555
Oh, God, get down, get down!

04:49.590 --> 04:51.124
What?
Please, please, get down!

04:51.158 --> 04:52.158
Why?

04:52.192 --> 04:53.927
What am I getting down for?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.728
Oh God, it's Mark from SNC.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.130
He lives down the street.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.098
He takes my trash out.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.401
What is he doing taking
your garbage out?

05:01.435 --> 05:02.835
Oh, it's no big deal.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.570
He just helps me out.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.773
He helps out.
Yeah.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.075
You sure you guys
just work together?

05:09.109 --> 05:10.443
You sure?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.945
Trust me, that's all we do.
Okay.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.346
All right.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.581
I think I can handle
trash day from now on, baby.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.583
Really?
Yeah.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.052
Mm-hmm.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.922
Call me the trash man.

05:22.957 --> 05:25.291
Mmm, the trash man.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.493
Do I have to crawl out
or can I get up and walk out?

05:29.129 --> 05:30.530
I think the coast is clear.
Okay.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.334
Good morning.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.569
I love rainy days.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.705
Good morning.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.306
Oh.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.276
Green tea?

05:43.310 --> 05:45.678
Yeah, you said you was
trying to stop coffee.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.352
Um, I don't really know
how to bring this up, but...

05:54.788 --> 05:59.492
...I found homework when
I was unpacking.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.861
You got something
you want to tell me?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.997
No, they're for
the sign off for my show.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.601
But it's like a lot, baby.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.970
I mean, this is a lot.

06:11.005 --> 06:13.639
Most people, you know, they type
this stuff up on the computer.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.842
They don't scribble it on paper.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.911
Yeah, like crazy people, right?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.714
That's why I didn't
want to tell you.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.216
I like having them
up around the house,

06:23.250 --> 06:24.984
but most people don't
get it, so...

06:25.019 --> 06:26.085
No, it's all right.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.387
I get it.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.222
I already know you're crazy.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.157
Put it up, put them everywhere.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.592
Put 'em... I don't know...
put them on your headboard.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.793
I don't care.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.528
Put them on your head.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.664
I will.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.974
"The most common way
people give up their power

06:48.008 --> 06:49.509
is by thinking they
don't have any."

06:51.578 --> 06:53.446
Alice Walker.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.084
- Do you want to have breakfast?
- Oh!

06:59.019 --> 07:00.653
Do you want to have breakfast?

07:00.687 --> 07:02.402
Do you want to have breakfast?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.658
I want to, but I can't.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.227
I got my son's basketball
game in an hour.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.763
What about lunch?

07:10.798 --> 07:12.598
I can't.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.400
I have the Founders' Tea

07:14.435 --> 07:17.470
for the charity
gala with my mom.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.739
Oh, you would not believe
how much those women

07:19.773 --> 07:23.009
care about floral arrangements.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.312
So no breakfast, no lunch.
Mm-mm.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.714
So I guess that means
I'll see you later, then?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.149
Hmm.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.253
Yes, you will.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.290
Don't you say home.
You know.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.758
Well, damn.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.531
Put one of my quotes up.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.716
Is that you smelling like that?

08:03.750 --> 08:04.984
Look at...

08:05.018 --> 08:06.219
We might need to change up.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.054
Where your mama...

08:08.088 --> 08:09.188
Grandpa should.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.723
I want to see you
change this diaper.

08:10.757 --> 08:11.878
I'm not changing anybody's...

08:11.892 --> 08:14.694
That's your
job right here, that's...

08:14.728 --> 08:16.162
Hey, Mom.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.231
Helen, how was the tea?

08:18.265 --> 08:19.832
Well...

08:19.867 --> 08:21.634
I would love to know
why you didn't get

08:21.668 --> 08:23.936
a platinum table this year?

08:27.474 --> 08:29.175
Come on, baby.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.212
Let's go see what
your cousins are doing.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.780
All right, Dad.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.381
I need a nap.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.318
Helen, we already
talked about this.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.856
With Paul Jr.'s tuition,
fixing the roof,

08:43.890 --> 08:45.024
our medical expenses,

08:45.058 --> 08:46.959
we just couldn't do it all.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.195
I'm not asking for
you to do it all.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.231
I'm just asking for you
to get a platinum table

08:52.266 --> 08:56.035
for the charity I helped build.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.037
Helen, you know our situation.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.705
What am I supposed to do?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.874
We just can't live
the way we used to.

09:01.909 --> 09:05.645
Oh, but you still golf at
the country club...

09:05.679 --> 09:07.246
don't you?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.051
This is a sacrifice
we had to make.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.621
It's only temporary.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.191
Temporary has come and gone.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.994
I am tired of making sacrifices.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.130
The house isn't in order.

09:24.164 --> 09:28.267
Full of kids and grandkids
and their kids.

09:28.302 --> 09:31.771
I have gone through
too much with my health

09:31.805 --> 09:35.374
and now I'm feeling great again.

09:35.409 --> 09:39.879
And even more than
that, I deserve this.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.048
I deserve to get out,

09:42.082 --> 09:46.986
have a great time
and be with our element.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.588
So fix it.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.724
Please.

09:58.717 --> 10:00.184
It was an honest mistake.

10:00.218 --> 10:03.020
I mean, this table means
so much to our family.

10:03.055 --> 10:05.456
It's tradition.

10:05.490 --> 10:08.893
So is there any way we
can make a table swap?

10:12.898 --> 10:15.666
While I'm honored that
you thought of me,

10:15.701 --> 10:19.036
I have... waited to
get a platinum table

10:19.071 --> 10:21.338
for a long time.

10:21.373 --> 10:22.740
I can't just give it away.

10:22.774 --> 10:24.141
Oh no, no, of course not.

10:24.176 --> 10:27.845
Listen, I'm willing to pay
the difference for the table.

10:27.879 --> 10:29.680
Paul.

10:29.715 --> 10:32.183
Now you know me
better than that.

10:32.217 --> 10:34.885
Money is a good start,

10:34.920 --> 10:37.655
but I know what I have to offer.

10:37.689 --> 10:42.093
The question is, what are
you going to offer me?

11:05.917 --> 11:09.353
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

11:09.387 --> 11:11.388
We just landed
the Ferguson account.

11:12.924 --> 11:14.592
All right.

11:14.626 --> 11:17.628
They loved our work,
they really loved it, all right.

11:17.662 --> 11:19.296
And they can't wait to
get started.

11:19.331 --> 11:21.565
Thank you, all of you,
for all your long hours.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.602
Now let's put in some longer
hours and kick some ass.

11:24.636 --> 11:26.771
We got champagne
in the conference room.

11:26.805 --> 11:28.472
All right.

11:29.641 --> 11:31.175
Hey, good work, man.

11:31.209 --> 11:32.543
Thank you.
Yeah.

11:32.577 --> 11:35.379
So, um, the changes that we
made, did they like them?

11:35.413 --> 11:37.047
The ones that we
made over the weekend?

11:37.082 --> 11:39.283
It's what sealed the deal.

11:39.317 --> 11:41.385
And your hard work is
not going unnoticed.

11:41.419 --> 11:43.254
As soon as you graduate,
man, this internship

11:43.288 --> 11:44.922
can turn into
something permanent.

11:44.956 --> 11:46.590
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.159
You know I will.
Let's go celebrate.

11:48.193 --> 11:49.326
All right, let's do it.

11:59.104 --> 12:01.071
What's up?

12:01.106 --> 12:03.507
It's about Terrence Mitchell.

12:03.542 --> 12:04.975
There's a story breaking

12:05.010 --> 12:07.077
involving the prison expose
he wrote.

12:07.112 --> 12:10.047
Apparently, his main
source on all those articles

12:10.081 --> 12:11.782
is recanting his story.

12:11.817 --> 12:14.919
He says he lied
and Terrence knew.

12:14.953 --> 12:17.521
Terrence is being accused of
journalistic fraud.

12:17.556 --> 12:19.056
That's crazy.

12:19.090 --> 12:20.825
Crazy enough to be true.

12:20.859 --> 12:22.626
I mean, think about it, MJ.

12:22.661 --> 12:25.062
Those articles sparked
prison reform in Iowa

12:25.096 --> 12:27.298
and launched Terrence's career.

12:27.332 --> 12:29.500
Why would his informant
change his story now?

12:29.534 --> 12:31.468
Well, he was arrested again
and probably cut a deal,

12:31.503 --> 12:33.270
but that doesn't
mean he's lying.

12:33.305 --> 12:36.106
No, what it means is he's
trying to save his own ass.

12:36.141 --> 12:37.241
Kara, come on.

12:37.275 --> 12:39.643
We know Terrence.

12:39.678 --> 12:41.212
We know him.

12:41.246 --> 12:43.981
He and I have been tight since
junior year at Northwestern.

12:44.015 --> 12:45.549
We've had him on
the show how many times?

12:45.584 --> 12:46.851
Come on.

12:46.885 --> 12:48.752
We have to have
the team check into this.

12:48.787 --> 12:49.987
Listen.

12:50.021 --> 12:52.122
He hasn't given an interview.

12:52.157 --> 12:53.591
So why don't you reach out
to him,

12:53.625 --> 12:54.992
get him on the show?

12:55.026 --> 12:58.128
I would do it, but I think this
needs your personal touch.

13:08.974 --> 13:10.507
I don't believe it.

13:10.542 --> 13:12.276
I don't know, MJ.

13:12.310 --> 13:13.978
The longer I live,
the more I realize

13:14.012 --> 13:16.113
we're all living big, fat lies.

13:24.990 --> 13:27.858
Oh, babe, what a great gift.

13:27.893 --> 13:29.059
I love it.

13:31.196 --> 13:33.964
Terrence Mitchell,
that is a bad brother.

13:33.999 --> 13:35.366
What you know about him?

13:35.400 --> 13:36.600
You kidding me?

13:36.635 --> 13:39.603
Who didn't read those prison
articles in "The Washington Post"?

13:39.638 --> 13:41.505
Dirty guards, dead inmate,

13:41.539 --> 13:44.041
warden that
tried to cover it up.

13:44.075 --> 13:45.809
People were talking about
that scandal for weeks.

13:45.844 --> 13:47.111
Still are.

13:47.145 --> 13:48.579
You know, baby, I got some
boys that are locked up

13:48.613 --> 13:51.215
and I always feel like
Terrence speaks up for those

13:51.249 --> 13:52.783
that can't speak up
for themselves.

13:55.253 --> 13:58.188
So now that you have
completely made my day,

13:58.223 --> 13:59.590
how was your day?

13:59.624 --> 14:00.991
Oh, let's see.

14:01.026 --> 14:04.561
Uh, my mom is driving my dad
crazy about this gala.

14:04.596 --> 14:06.263
Spending money they don't have.

14:06.298 --> 14:08.766
How long did Mom
have you on the phone?

14:08.800 --> 14:10.067
An hour.

14:10.101 --> 14:12.269
'Til I just couldn't
take it anymore.

14:12.304 --> 14:14.204
You should meet my Betty...
or they should meet.

14:14.239 --> 14:15.973
Oh, what else, what else?

14:17.108 --> 14:19.443
I was wondering...

14:19.477 --> 14:21.745
who I'm going to
take to the gala.

14:23.915 --> 14:25.683
Aren't you going with
your family?

14:25.717 --> 14:28.285
I mean, I am, but...

14:28.320 --> 14:30.321
I can't go, MJ.

14:30.355 --> 14:31.789
Why?

14:31.823 --> 14:33.257
Too many people
know I'm married.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.392
It's enough that I'm already
divorcing her.

14:35.427 --> 14:39.196
I don't think I should
publicly embarrass her, too.

14:39.230 --> 14:40.397
She doesn't deserve that.

14:43.535 --> 14:46.603
I hate that we... we can't
tell anybody about us.

14:46.638 --> 14:48.672
We can't go anywhere.

14:48.707 --> 14:51.709
I mean, at some point,
we'll have to be public.

14:51.743 --> 14:54.244
But you can't put
all this on me now.

14:54.279 --> 14:56.513
Come on, you're hiding me, too.

14:56.548 --> 14:58.048
Mark took the trash out
the other night,

14:58.083 --> 15:00.050
it wasn't like you
were exactly excited about

15:00.085 --> 15:01.385
showing me off.

15:01.419 --> 15:02.987
But I want to
change that, though.

15:03.021 --> 15:05.422
Okay, well, I want to change it
too, but now's not the time.

15:05.457 --> 15:06.991
I can't go to the gala.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.701
All right, we'll do
a prerecorded piece,

15:17.736 --> 15:19.370
bring the audience up to speed
at the top of the block

15:19.404 --> 15:20.971
and then we'll go
straight into our one-on-one.

15:21.006 --> 15:23.307
And are you highlighting some
of my key achievements,

15:23.341 --> 15:25.809
like career,
community, activism?

15:25.819 --> 15:27.620
Terrence, please, you are not
writing my copy.

15:27.645 --> 15:30.080
I'm not trying to write your
copy, but let's be clear.

15:30.115 --> 15:31.548
You're getting an exclusive.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.218
And you're getting a powerful
platform to tell your story.

15:34.252 --> 15:36.220
True, but I'd still
like to see the questions

15:36.254 --> 15:37.788
before we go on air.

15:37.822 --> 15:39.523
Not gonna happen.

15:39.557 --> 15:40.924
Look, how would you like it if
somebody came into your house

15:40.959 --> 15:42.393
trying to run the show?

15:42.427 --> 15:43.827
I shut they ass down.

15:43.862 --> 15:46.363
So I'm shutting your ass down.

15:46.398 --> 15:47.798
Don't take offense.

15:51.803 --> 15:53.203
It isn't true, is it?

15:54.572 --> 15:55.539
Please don't insult me

15:55.573 --> 15:57.241
when you know
there's another 24-hour

15:57.275 --> 15:59.043
news outlet right down
the street.

16:01.579 --> 16:03.047
Hi.

16:03.081 --> 16:04.415
Kara, what's up?
Hey.

16:04.449 --> 16:05.716
How you doing?
Good to see you.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.851
Good to see you.
Yeah.

16:07.886 --> 16:09.353
I gotta get out of here.

16:09.387 --> 16:11.288
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
All right.

16:11.322 --> 16:12.523
Let's get out
tomorrow after the show.

16:12.557 --> 16:13.724
Sounds good.
All right.

16:13.758 --> 16:14.958
Okay, bye-bye.

16:17.395 --> 16:18.629
We have proof he's lying.

16:23.101 --> 16:24.168
Damn.

16:25.270 --> 16:26.270
Hello, Glen.

16:26.304 --> 16:27.371
Paul Patterson here.

16:27.405 --> 16:28.772
Good morning, Mr. Patterson.

16:28.807 --> 16:30.641
Listen, uh, did you
receive that fax

16:30.675 --> 16:32.242
from my portfolio manager?

16:32.277 --> 16:33.977
Yes, I received a fax from

16:34.012 --> 16:36.113
Morgan Stanley Wealth
Management.

16:36.147 --> 16:37.915
The wire transfer
has been authorized

16:37.949 --> 16:40.551
from the sell of your
Vantage Airline stock.

16:40.585 --> 16:43.120
No, no, that was a partial sell.

16:43.154 --> 16:44.655
I'll always own a piece
of that company.

16:44.689 --> 16:46.323
I put in too many years there.

16:46.357 --> 16:48.392
Oh, excuse me, partial sell.

16:48.426 --> 16:50.928
Glen, would you send me a copy
of my account balance, please?

16:50.962 --> 16:53.197
No problem,
just e-mailed it over

16:53.231 --> 16:55.065
if you want to hang on.

16:57.469 --> 16:59.703
Uh.

17:02.807 --> 17:04.974
That can't be right.

17:17.155 --> 17:18.922
Hey, I have a meeting
with Ray Landers.

17:18.957 --> 17:20.057
You must be Paul.

17:20.090 --> 17:22.192
Please, come in.
Thank you.

17:22.227 --> 17:24.428
You come highly recommended.

17:24.462 --> 17:27.364
Yeah, well, uh,
Sharice has been good to me.

17:27.397 --> 17:28.799
How do you know her again?

17:28.833 --> 17:31.668
Oh, let's just say my wife
helps keep that place afloat,

17:31.703 --> 17:33.437
she buys so many shoes.

17:34.639 --> 17:36.240
Come on, let's go into the kitchen.
Sure.

17:38.143 --> 17:40.577
You wanted an eighth
of organic Bubba

17:40.612 --> 17:43.413
and an eighth of
King Louis XIII.

17:43.448 --> 17:45.716
And since you're
a first-time customer,

17:45.750 --> 17:47.390
I'll throw in these
pre-rolled snow cones.

17:48.753 --> 17:50.754
That'll be 300 bucks even.

17:52.056 --> 17:54.558
Thank you.
No, thank you.

17:54.592 --> 17:56.660
Remember, I'm just
a phone call away.

17:58.907 --> 18:00.574
What's up, Mary Jane?
Hey, Terrence.

18:00.593 --> 18:02.260
Uh, can I have a second, please?

18:02.295 --> 18:03.528
Yeah.
Thanks, Lance.

18:05.131 --> 18:06.198
What's up?

18:06.232 --> 18:07.666
Um...

18:08.734 --> 18:10.035
You okay?

18:10.069 --> 18:11.636
No, actually.

18:11.671 --> 18:15.340
Um, it's about the show.

18:15.374 --> 18:18.910
Uh, so my team broke a story...

18:18.945 --> 18:20.312
Wait, wait, don't tell me.

18:20.346 --> 18:22.714
You're bumping me for
a bigger news story.

18:22.748 --> 18:23.782
No, no.

18:23.816 --> 18:26.885
Uh, it's about your
Ft. Jasper articles.

18:28.654 --> 18:31.690
Your ex-girlfriend
Raina...

18:31.724 --> 18:33.291
she's come forward.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.595
Well, Raina's my ex
for a reason, right?

18:36.629 --> 18:37.896
Yeah, no, I get that,

18:37.930 --> 18:39.831
but did you ever at
any point tell her

18:39.866 --> 18:42.467
that some of the facts in
your articles are fabricated?

18:44.270 --> 18:45.437
Wait a second.

18:45.471 --> 18:46.805
Why are you asking me that?

18:46.839 --> 18:51.042
Okay, 'cause, Terrence, not only does
she remember it, she recorded it.

18:53.346 --> 18:54.946
Okay!

18:54.981 --> 18:58.950
Maybe I embellished a few
details about Ft. Jasper,

18:58.985 --> 19:00.285
but we both know

19:00.319 --> 19:03.221
this corruption
is happening all over.

19:03.256 --> 19:05.524
Every word I wrote describing
the heinous treatment

19:05.558 --> 19:07.058
of prisoners is true.

19:07.093 --> 19:11.363
It's just another form of slavery,
Mary Jane, and you know it.

19:11.397 --> 19:13.064
Listen.

19:13.099 --> 19:16.034
My articles have
sparked reform in Iowa.

19:16.068 --> 19:18.803
Now we starting to make
strides in Ohio.

19:18.838 --> 19:20.705
Nonviolent criminals
are serving time in

19:20.740 --> 19:23.375
community-based programs.

19:23.409 --> 19:26.244
Rehab facilities, not prison.

19:26.279 --> 19:28.313
They've helped
change legislation

19:28.347 --> 19:31.917
and holding big businesses
like CFF accountable.

19:31.951 --> 19:33.885
This is a good thing, Mary Jane.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.688
No, it's a bad thing, 'cause
everything you've accomplished,

19:36.722 --> 19:39.591
all that progress, has been
compromised.

19:39.625 --> 19:42.627
It's only compromised if
you put Raina on the show.

19:45.698 --> 19:47.899
Do you think that
we're the only news source

19:47.934 --> 19:50.835
that'll run with this, huh?

19:50.870 --> 19:52.203
Honey, this is breaking news

19:52.238 --> 19:53.738
whether we air this or not,

19:53.773 --> 19:57.042
so what I am saying
to you, what I am...

19:57.076 --> 19:59.578
what I am offering you

19:59.612 --> 20:03.515
is to have a voice in how
this whole thing plays out.

20:03.549 --> 20:06.051
I am not walking into an ambush.

20:06.085 --> 20:07.719
Why don't you
put another guard on?

20:07.753 --> 20:09.854
Another inmate?

20:09.889 --> 20:10.922
Anything.

20:10.957 --> 20:12.424
Just leave her out of this.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.125
You can't ask me to do that.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.428
How are you asking me to do it?

20:16.462 --> 20:18.096
I thought we were friends.

20:18.130 --> 20:19.197
Five-minute warning.

20:23.436 --> 20:25.870
Just... just
think this through.

20:25.905 --> 20:28.974
It's not just about me.

20:29.008 --> 20:33.244
If you put her on, all of
this goes down the drain.

20:33.279 --> 20:34.512
All of it.

20:37.350 --> 20:40.218
Well, it certainly has
been an eye-opening show.

20:40.252 --> 20:41.830
We did reach out to
Terrence Mitchell

20:41.831 --> 20:43.688
to come on and give
his side of the story,

20:43.723 --> 20:45.156
but he declined.

20:45.191 --> 20:46.713
I'd like to thank my guest
Raina Hilson

20:46.714 --> 20:49.461
for shedding some light
on this evolving story

20:49.495 --> 20:52.197
and in the words
of Ralph Waldo Emerson,

20:52.231 --> 20:55.000
"God offers to every mind its
choice between

20:55.034 --> 20:57.335
"truth and repose.

20:57.370 --> 20:59.604
Take what you please, you can
never have both."

21:00.773 --> 21:03.541
I'm Mary Jane Paul
and thank you for listening.

21:06.612 --> 21:07.679
You're out.

21:09.415 --> 21:10.482
Nice show.

21:16.856 --> 21:19.591
Make sure the lineup is on
the main teleprompter.

21:23.896 --> 21:25.263
Great show.

21:56.662 --> 21:57.862
Hey, babe.

22:05.838 --> 22:06.938
Here.

22:09.575 --> 22:11.743
Want to talk about it?

22:11.777 --> 22:12.844
No.
No?

22:14.380 --> 22:16.181
Okay.

22:16.215 --> 22:17.816
Well, I think
you did the right thing.

22:36.902 --> 22:38.503
What's going on, Dad?

22:46.011 --> 22:49.280
You got an extra job
I don't know about?

22:49.315 --> 22:51.449
Extra job, what are
you talking about?

22:51.484 --> 22:53.551
I spoke with Glen today

22:53.586 --> 22:56.187
and he accidentally
e-mailed me

22:56.222 --> 22:58.957
a printout of your account.

22:58.991 --> 23:02.894
You want to tell me why you
have $78,000 in the bank?

23:06.766 --> 23:10.435
Dad, this is... this is
clearly a bank error.

23:10.469 --> 23:13.204
Do you think if
I had $78,000 in my account,

23:13.239 --> 23:15.306
I'd still be living
at the house?

23:15.341 --> 23:17.876
Now, I have
$7,800 in my account.

23:17.910 --> 23:20.345
Why do you have that much?

23:20.379 --> 23:22.747
I took out a student loan.

23:22.782 --> 23:24.449
Look, I can see things are

23:24.483 --> 23:25.917
tight around the house,
you know,

23:25.951 --> 23:28.119
and I didn't want to
add stress to you and Mom.

23:28.154 --> 23:29.487
I thought it would help.

23:31.290 --> 23:33.658
You want to help, Paul?

23:33.692 --> 23:34.859
Focus.

23:34.894 --> 23:36.694
Graduate.

23:36.729 --> 23:38.730
I mean, first it was law school,

23:38.764 --> 23:40.999
now it's architecture.

23:41.033 --> 23:42.867
We support you...

23:42.902 --> 23:46.137
but it's time for you
to be a man and get this done.

23:46.172 --> 23:49.607
Pay off the loan and come
to me next time.

23:49.642 --> 23:51.342
You understand?

23:51.377 --> 23:53.444
I understand.

23:53.479 --> 23:54.913
Don't do this again.

24:07.193 --> 24:08.593
My God.

24:18.170 --> 24:20.572
Helen, you look amazing.

24:20.606 --> 24:22.006
Stop.

24:22.041 --> 24:24.776
I'd lie and say
I threw this together,

24:24.810 --> 24:28.046
but you know me better
than that.

24:29.081 --> 24:30.281
Helen.
Sharice.

24:30.316 --> 24:31.416
How's the family?

24:31.450 --> 24:32.650
Oh, thank you for asking.

24:32.685 --> 24:34.118
We're all doing well.

24:34.153 --> 24:35.753
Paul and I were just saying that

24:35.788 --> 24:38.790
we may be going traveling
overseas again.

24:38.824 --> 24:41.826
And Mary Jane's show
is more popular than ever.

24:41.861 --> 24:45.496
And my baby, oh, Paul Jr.

24:45.531 --> 24:48.533
He's just a year
from being an architect.

24:48.567 --> 24:49.734
Paul, Paul Jr.?

24:49.768 --> 24:50.835
Yes?

24:50.870 --> 24:52.237
This is Sharice and Greg.

24:52.271 --> 24:55.473
Show my friends your latest
drawings of my dream house.

24:55.507 --> 24:57.642
I don't have it on me, Mom.

24:57.676 --> 24:59.377
Well, trust me, Sharice.

24:59.411 --> 25:01.112
They're brilliant.

25:01.146 --> 25:02.914
Hey.

25:02.948 --> 25:05.250
Remind me again why
we're alone at this event?

25:05.284 --> 25:06.584
We're not.

25:06.619 --> 25:07.719
We have each other.

25:07.753 --> 25:09.354
Oh, I like that.

25:11.223 --> 25:13.925
Oh, you clean up well, Patrick.

25:13.959 --> 25:14.959
So do you.

25:14.994 --> 25:16.394
Thank you.

25:16.428 --> 25:17.695
You look good.

25:17.730 --> 25:18.963
Thank you, Mom.

25:18.998 --> 25:21.398
- What, you didn't bring your
married guy tonight? - Shut up.

25:23.135 --> 25:24.602
You're welcome.

25:24.637 --> 25:26.237
Did you guys discuss
the show already?

25:26.272 --> 25:29.007
- Oh, we don't have to talk about that.
- Talk about what?

25:29.041 --> 25:30.008
"Talkback."

25:30.042 --> 25:31.242
That Terrence Mitchell segment.

25:31.277 --> 25:32.443
Yeah, you slayed him.

25:32.478 --> 25:33.544
I didn't slay him.

25:33.579 --> 25:34.646
I just reported the facts.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.147
She called him out.

25:36.181 --> 25:39.150
Shoot, that's business as usual
with you, huh, Mary Jane?

25:39.184 --> 25:40.418
Well, he lied.

25:40.452 --> 25:44.122
If anybody knows black people
can't mess up, it's us

25:44.156 --> 25:46.057
and that was his fault.

25:50.496 --> 25:51.763
Dad?

25:52.965 --> 25:55.600
I think I'm gonna freshen
your mother's drink.

25:57.670 --> 25:59.504
So nice to have you
join us, Lisa.

25:59.538 --> 26:00.872
Thank you.

26:01.941 --> 26:03.708
Oh, look, there's David.

26:03.742 --> 26:04.809
Mom, don't do that.

26:04.843 --> 26:06.511
David!
Don't do that, Mom.

26:06.545 --> 26:07.812
Don't, don't.

26:09.381 --> 26:10.815
Hey, Mrs. Patterson,
how are you?

26:10.849 --> 26:13.251
David.
Lovely, as always.

26:13.285 --> 26:14.719
Are you getting taller?

26:14.753 --> 26:16.220
I'm trying.

26:16.255 --> 26:17.422
What up, D?

26:17.456 --> 26:18.890
What's up, son?

26:18.924 --> 26:20.425
You good?
Hey, I'm good, I'm good.

26:20.459 --> 26:21.711
Hey, I'm still waiting on those

26:21.712 --> 26:23.795
- Hawks tickets you promised.
- I got you, I told you.

26:23.829 --> 26:26.397
- Just let me know what game, all right?
- Okay, okay.

26:26.432 --> 26:27.865
Is that David?

26:27.900 --> 26:28.866
Looking sharp.

26:28.901 --> 26:30.201
Thank you, sir.

26:30.235 --> 26:31.703
How'd that buyout meeting go?

26:31.737 --> 26:33.037
Did they meet the demands
we discussed?

26:33.072 --> 26:34.439
They absolutely did.

26:34.473 --> 26:35.840
Every one of them.

26:35.874 --> 26:38.009
You're selling In The Cut?

26:38.043 --> 26:39.444
Well, I'm in negotiation.

26:39.478 --> 26:41.112
It's not a done deal but...

26:41.146 --> 26:44.582
your father's been advising me,
so it's looking good.

26:44.616 --> 26:46.250
But that's your baby.

26:46.285 --> 26:48.486
Well, for $12 million,
he can buy a new baby

26:48.520 --> 26:50.989
and start
a new online sensation.

26:53.425 --> 26:55.226
Oh, enough business, gentlemen.

26:55.260 --> 26:56.961
David, sit down and join us.

26:56.996 --> 26:58.096
Well, I would love to,

26:58.130 --> 26:59.797
but I'm proud to say
I actually have

26:59.832 --> 27:01.299
my own table this year.

27:01.333 --> 27:02.834
Oh my.

27:02.868 --> 27:04.602
A generous donation.

27:04.636 --> 27:07.305
Well, you can't say I didn't
listen to your call to action.

27:07.339 --> 27:10.541
I've always wanted to be more
involved and now I can be.

27:10.576 --> 27:13.544
Oh, excuse me, we need all
the founders

27:13.579 --> 27:15.279
for a quick photo op.

27:15.314 --> 27:17.815
That's you.

27:19.651 --> 27:21.152
We'll talk another time.

27:21.186 --> 27:22.487
Absolutely.

27:23.789 --> 27:25.923
We need all the founders
for a quick photo op.

27:26.925 --> 27:28.026
Wow.

27:29.661 --> 27:33.264
You look incredible.

27:33.298 --> 27:35.033
Thank you.

27:42.356 --> 27:43.949
Haven't spoken
to you in a minute.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.749
Yeah, we haven't
spoken in a while,

27:46.783 --> 27:49.886
but you still are talking
to my parents.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.887
What are you saying?

27:50.910 --> 27:53.630
Just can't we can't get it together, I'm
supposed to cut off your family, too?

27:53.631 --> 27:55.658
Basically, yeah.

27:55.692 --> 27:57.193
That's usually how it works.

27:57.227 --> 27:59.095
We're a package deal.

28:02.733 --> 28:04.433
You're wearing the cufflinks.

28:04.468 --> 28:06.202
Oh, yeah,
I love these cufflinks.

28:06.236 --> 28:07.403
Do you?
Yeah.

28:07.437 --> 28:09.572
I bought them two years ago.
I've never seen you wear them.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.240
They're expensive cufflinks.

28:11.274 --> 28:14.010
Where's a computer geek gonna
wear something like this?

28:14.044 --> 28:17.313
It's not like I got a lot of
galas on my calendar, you know?

28:17.347 --> 28:19.582
You do now.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.117
Yeah, I guess I do.

28:23.620 --> 28:25.221
Oh, I think my mom got you...

28:25.255 --> 28:27.690
You got lipstick right there.
Can you get it for me?

28:27.724 --> 28:29.592
No, I told you where it is
so you can get it yourself.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.760
Ha.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.195
Okay.
You know, last year, you...

28:33.230 --> 28:35.331
Yeah, a lot has
changed since last year.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.666
May I have your attention?

28:37.701 --> 28:39.535
Thank you.

28:39.569 --> 28:41.937
We are so excited that this is

28:41.972 --> 28:46.275
the 30th Annual
Jack and Jill Gala.

28:46.309 --> 28:48.711
And the money we've raised
tonight will benefit

28:48.745 --> 28:51.414
the United Negro College Fund.

28:59.856 --> 29:02.525
And now, we'd like to
acknowledge

29:02.559 --> 29:05.594
the people
who have built this legacy.

29:05.629 --> 29:08.264
We want to welcome back
Helen Patterson.

29:08.298 --> 29:11.067
Oh, we have missed
you the last two years.

29:11.101 --> 29:12.134
Thank you.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.370
I just want to say a few words.

29:14.404 --> 29:19.675
As a founder member, I am just
so happy and blessed

29:19.709 --> 29:23.045
to share this
moment with all of you.

29:23.080 --> 29:26.415
It warms my heart to see
all your faces

29:26.450 --> 29:28.384
because without you,

29:28.418 --> 29:30.352
none of this would be possible.

29:30.387 --> 29:33.856
I'd also like to implore
all you young people

29:33.890 --> 29:35.724
who are going out
in the world today

29:35.759 --> 29:38.861
to give back,

29:38.895 --> 29:41.964
help keep this
organization going.

29:41.998 --> 29:45.000
David Paulk...

29:45.035 --> 29:47.603
I am delighted
by the goal you have set

29:47.637 --> 29:50.306
by your peers.

29:50.340 --> 29:53.309
Despite a demanding schedule,

29:53.343 --> 29:55.344
you have carved out
time and effort

29:55.378 --> 29:58.981
for all of us
and we are so grateful.

29:59.015 --> 30:01.884
I must say, uh...

30:01.918 --> 30:06.322
my dreams of welcoming you
to our family

30:06.356 --> 30:08.791
have not subsided.

30:08.825 --> 30:10.860
We're not getting
any younger, David.

30:12.929 --> 30:14.363
So...

30:14.397 --> 30:20.102
cheers to our children's
future and education

30:20.137 --> 30:25.207
because a mind is
a terrible thing to waste.

30:25.242 --> 30:26.475
Cheers.

30:26.510 --> 30:27.743
Cheers!

30:33.450 --> 30:36.986
Why are you in here
when David's out there?

30:37.020 --> 30:39.421
'Cause that was way too much.

30:39.456 --> 30:42.124
Like... way too much.

30:42.159 --> 30:43.792
Mary Jane, you guys
have always been

30:43.827 --> 30:45.794
playing these games.

30:45.829 --> 30:47.229
Aren't you tired of it?

30:47.264 --> 30:48.931
You're 38.

30:48.965 --> 30:50.699
It's not cute any more.

30:50.734 --> 30:53.636
If he was interested,
he'd step up.

30:53.670 --> 30:56.238
Maybe you need to step up.

30:56.273 --> 30:57.439
What more do you need?

30:57.474 --> 30:58.440
He's here alone,

30:58.475 --> 31:00.409
he still talks to your family.

31:00.443 --> 31:01.911
Hello?

31:01.945 --> 31:03.646
God's trying to
tell you something.

31:03.680 --> 31:04.947
Really?

31:04.981 --> 31:07.116
'Cause God sounds
an awful lot like

31:07.150 --> 31:10.252
my pushy but well-meaning
friend.

31:10.287 --> 31:11.587
I'm going to say it.

31:11.621 --> 31:13.989
You were wrong.

31:14.024 --> 31:16.292
David was right
not to trust you.

31:16.326 --> 31:17.960
It's your move.

31:17.994 --> 31:19.228
What are you going to do?

31:26.369 --> 31:27.870
Uh, hold on, Miss Paul.

31:27.904 --> 31:29.572
I'd like a word.

31:29.606 --> 31:31.941
I caught your show today
on Terrence Mitchell.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.342
Oh, thank you.

31:33.376 --> 31:36.111
Well, actually, I should be
thanking you

31:36.146 --> 31:37.379
for being one more black woman

31:37.414 --> 31:39.515
to bring down a black man.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.784
Terrence Mitchell
brought himself down.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.386
He had a responsibility to do
his job ethically

31:44.421 --> 31:45.487
and so do I.

31:46.423 --> 31:47.389
Uh, hold on.

31:47.424 --> 31:48.584
White people lie all the time

31:48.592 --> 31:50.359
to push forward their agendas

31:50.393 --> 31:51.694
and what happens?

31:51.728 --> 31:53.295
Not a damn thing.

31:53.330 --> 31:55.931
But you want to
talk about ethics?

31:55.966 --> 31:57.266
Hold on, we're not done yet.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.667
Yeah.

31:58.702 --> 32:00.462
Yeah, you are.
Brother, we were just talking.

32:01.605 --> 32:03.105
What's wrong,
you didn't hear me?

32:03.139 --> 32:04.540
Talk's over.

32:04.574 --> 32:06.075
It's not the time
or the place, bro.

32:09.746 --> 32:11.447
You all right?

32:11.481 --> 32:13.515
Yeah.

32:13.550 --> 32:16.085
How many hours you got
left in those shoes?

32:16.119 --> 32:17.987
Why are you asking?

32:18.021 --> 32:19.388
'Cause I want to dance with you.

32:21.691 --> 32:23.559
It's a fast song.

32:23.593 --> 32:24.960
I think I can hang with you.

32:26.529 --> 32:27.930
Oh.

32:27.964 --> 32:30.032
Potential investor.
Right.

32:30.066 --> 32:32.601
I'll give him some attention
and then I'll find you, okay?

32:39.843 --> 32:40.843
Incredible dress.

32:40.877 --> 32:42.311
Oh, thank you, Kathryn.

32:42.345 --> 32:43.679
You're looking well.

32:43.713 --> 32:45.581
Oh, thank you,
thank you very much.

32:49.986 --> 32:52.054
Kathryn, would you
like to dance?

32:52.088 --> 32:53.489
Yes, I would love to.

33:01.798 --> 33:04.600
What do you think you're doing?

33:04.634 --> 33:06.969
You wanted a platinum
table, didn't you?

33:15.912 --> 33:17.313
Came to my parents' table

33:17.347 --> 33:19.148
and I couldn't even get a hello?

33:19.182 --> 33:20.549
Not here, Paul.

33:36.666 --> 33:39.401
You know why he's
dancing with her, right?

33:39.436 --> 33:41.770
So I can have this table.

33:41.805 --> 33:43.539
Mom, you pimped Dad out.

33:43.573 --> 33:45.207
Watch your language.

33:45.241 --> 33:48.544
It's not a Demi Moore movie.

33:48.578 --> 33:50.212
Go get Daddy.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.482
What are you waiting on?

33:57.287 --> 33:58.754
I got this.

34:36.860 --> 34:38.327
You ready for that dance?

35:00.641 --> 35:03.777
I can't believe the band is
playing "Gin and Juice."

35:03.811 --> 35:05.278
Are we that old?
Apparently.

35:05.313 --> 35:07.014
Now, don't get stiff on me.
Boy, please.

35:07.029 --> 35:08.515
You know I taught you to dance.

35:08.549 --> 35:10.317
Well, let's go then.

35:47.889 --> 35:49.556
You've got to be kidding me.

35:51.359 --> 35:53.405
You remember the first time
I played this for you?

35:55.096 --> 35:57.464
Right before I sold all my CDs,

35:57.498 --> 35:59.766
going after the dream.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.735
That's right.

36:01.769 --> 36:02.969
You've come a long way.

36:05.106 --> 36:06.339
And I'm happy for you.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.651
I've always loved your perfume.

36:21.556 --> 36:22.822
Your heart is racing.

36:33.534 --> 36:35.101
I tried to call you
a few weeks back.

36:37.305 --> 36:38.838
Booty call?

36:40.107 --> 36:41.141
You know damn well

36:41.175 --> 36:42.676
you and me were
never a booty call.

36:43.678 --> 36:46.012
I wanted to tell you

36:46.047 --> 36:48.682
before you heard it
in the streets.

36:48.716 --> 36:49.849
Okay.

36:53.354 --> 36:54.588
I'm seeing someone.

36:55.990 --> 36:58.225
Oh.

36:58.259 --> 36:59.793
Yeah, it's, uh,

36:59.827 --> 37:00.948
it's only been a few months,

37:00.962 --> 37:03.129
but it's moving kind of fast.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.734
How fast?

37:07.768 --> 37:11.972
Like... are you
living together?

37:13.908 --> 37:15.208
When she's in town.

37:18.579 --> 37:19.546
Okay.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.081
Um...

37:21.115 --> 37:22.983
Thank you for the dance.

37:31.759 --> 37:33.593
Wait, you okay?

37:33.628 --> 37:34.828
Where you going, baby?

37:34.862 --> 37:36.162
Hey, look...

38:12.400 --> 38:14.067
Hey.

38:16.270 --> 38:18.271
Hey.

38:18.306 --> 38:21.441
You have enough energy
left for a dance?

38:21.475 --> 38:23.176
No, I'm tired.

38:23.210 --> 38:25.078
And you look beat, too.

38:25.112 --> 38:27.147
Yeah, I guess I'm pretty tired.

38:27.181 --> 38:28.515
You stayed out late.

38:28.549 --> 38:29.949
You have a good time?

38:29.984 --> 38:31.318
It was okay.

38:32.687 --> 38:34.190
I'm going to change
out of this dress.

39:47.995 --> 39:50.096
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there tonight.

39:50.131 --> 39:52.003
I promise next year
it'll be you and me.

39:56.604 --> 39:58.071
I promise.
