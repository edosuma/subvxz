00:06.882 --> 00:07.883
Mother, I'd like to...

00:07.883 --> 00:10.761
Sh... Sorry.

00:10.761 --> 00:14.806
Do you got any
dehydrated mango, ginger?

00:14.890 --> 00:16.558
Jicama, perhaps?

00:18.602 --> 00:20.270
Nah.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.027
This place sucks.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.785
How much for that hat?

00:34.785 --> 00:37.454
And this?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.498
Ten dollars.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.835
Bet.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.980
Oh. Look at you.

Thank you.

02:54.591 --> 02:58.762
Wow. I should probably... yeah.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.306
Okay.

I love Stevie.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.158
Yeah, me, too.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.578
I-I like to, uh,
listen to it on long drives

04:04.578 --> 04:07.748
because, uh,
his songs are long, you know?

04:07.748 --> 04:12.669
Yes.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.218
I'm Darius.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.095
Apologies.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.806
I'm Theodore Perkins.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.519
Please... call me Teddy.

04:37.903 --> 04:41.198
Come on. Please, come sit
in the parlor.

04:41.198 --> 04:47.246
Oh, cool. I've never been
in a house with a parlor before.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.962
Would you like a glass of water?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.130
Yeah.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.384
Kind of parched.

05:00.384 --> 05:04.513
Darius would like a glass
of water when you have a moment.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.563
Would you like some?

05:12.563 --> 05:13.981
What is that?

05:13.981 --> 05:17.401
It's a soft-boiled ostrich egg.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.278
It's called an owl's casket.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.988
Nah, I'm good.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.540
So...

06:17.169 --> 06:19.671
...you're here about the piano.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.632
How did you hear about it?

06:21.632 --> 06:24.510
Um...

06:24.510 --> 06:27.554
someone posted
on the biohacking message board

06:27.638 --> 06:31.141
saying their boss had
a multicolored key piano.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.685
Trying to get rid of it.
Free of charge.

06:33.769 --> 06:37.606
Sam. Was it Sam?

06:37.606 --> 06:40.901
My audiovisual woman.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.987
Uh, we don't use real names
on the message boards, so...

06:44.071 --> 06:46.240
so maybe?

06:46.240 --> 06:49.409
Hmm. Oops.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.750
Are you a music lover?

06:56.834 --> 07:00.629
Yeah. Yeah,
I consider myself... yeah.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.548
I work with a friend of mine.
He's a rapper.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.467
Rap.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.386
There's a funny one.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.645
I found it never quite grew
out of its adolescence.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.773
No, I wouldn't say that.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.359
You know, we got Jay-Z.
He's, like, 65.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.863
But don't you find it
insufficient as an art form?

07:25.863 --> 07:28.782
Nah, I think, you know,
every now and again,

07:28.866 --> 07:30.534
people just want
to have a good time.

07:32.578 --> 07:36.248
Good time.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.709
Hmm.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.130
How long have you played?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.676
Oh, you...

07:47.676 --> 07:48.886
you're talking about the piano.

07:48.886 --> 07:51.096
Uh, nah, I never studied.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.891
I just, uh, kind of like
the way it looks,

07:53.891 --> 07:55.893
especially this one
with the colored keys.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.853
Are you a fan of Benny's?

07:59.897 --> 08:01.023
Who?

08:01.023 --> 08:04.234
Benny Hope.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.029
The pianist.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.488
He's the one
who owned the piano.

08:08.572 --> 08:12.075
He's my brother.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.620
Oh, sh-shit, man,
is that Keith Jarrett?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.372
Yes.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.790
- Let me look at that.
- Yes.

08:18.874 --> 08:21.460
And Stevie, as well.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.630
And Al Jarreau and Ahmad Jamal.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.965
I think Nina's
over there somewhere.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.509
Ahmad and my brother--

08:28.509 --> 08:31.720
they had a residency
in New York together.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.932
Hmm. That's Flames, man.

08:34.932 --> 08:39.353
Yes. Flames.

08:39.353 --> 08:44.816
My-my brother and Ahmad,
they were staying at a-a hotel

08:44.900 --> 08:47.819
in Brooklyn
off of Bergen Street.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.613
Eight dollars a night,
if you can believe it.

08:49.613 --> 08:52.157
He told me something
I'll never forget.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.077
He said,
"Your brother...

08:55.077 --> 08:59.414
plays pain better than anyone."

09:01.542 --> 09:05.337
Benny just played what he knew.

09:05.337 --> 09:09.424
Is he, uh, no longer with us?

09:09.508 --> 09:13.095
No, he's alive.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.305
He lives here with me.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.725
I take care of him.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.562
He developed
a rare skin condition.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.981
Can no longer go
in the sunlight.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.070
And...

09:30.070 --> 09:33.031
And you see I keep it
quite dark in here.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.951
- Damn.
- Mm

09:35.951 --> 09:37.911
He must get depressed.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.621
It's not easy.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.707
But who knows?

09:41.707 --> 09:44.710
Maybe one day we'll get
a great album out of it.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.797
A masterpiece.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.511
Yeah. Righteous, brother.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.556
Uh, your, uh, your butler
or whatever,

09:57.556 --> 09:59.558
they, um, didn't bring
the water yet.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.603
Oh, I don't have a butler.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.607
I just use this
to remember things.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.736
<i>TEDDY Finish
that hat for Dionne Warwick.</i>

10:11.904 --> 10:15.032
<i>Wash your hands, immediately.</i>

10:15.032 --> 10:17.034
<i>- Darius would like a glass of water</i>

10:17.034 --> 10:19.411
<i>when you have a moment.</i>

10:19.411 --> 10:21.288
Right, then.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.584
Excuse me.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.058
This...

10:57.074 --> 11:00.911
Yeah, I can't sit next to this.
Mm-mmm.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.588
Mm.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.016
Uh-huh.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.836
Oh.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.116
- Oh!
- Ooh!

13:03.200 --> 13:06.119
What are you doing up here?

13:06.203 --> 13:08.330
Uh, I-I just heard the piano.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.998
It sounded great, so...

13:10.082 --> 13:12.876
Shh, shh. Benny, he...

13:12.960 --> 13:14.002
he's sleeping.

13:14.086 --> 13:16.088
He's very tired, mm.

13:16.088 --> 13:18.006
He needs his rest.

13:18.090 --> 13:20.008
Mm.
Okay.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.885
Uh-huh. Okay.
Thank you.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.138
- Um, cool.
- Do you...

13:25.222 --> 13:27.599
do you still want the water?

13:27.683 --> 13:29.017
Oh... yeah.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.894
I can bring it to you.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.896
Downstairs.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.190
Bottled or tap?

13:35.274 --> 13:37.776
Uh... bottled, I guess.

13:37.860 --> 13:38.861
Oh.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.320
Bottled.

13:40.404 --> 13:44.241
I'll bring it--
I have Fiji, and Evian.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.785
I'll mix it
with some Poland Springs.

13:46.869 --> 13:47.995
Maybe a Voss?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.872
Okay.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.373
No, I'll see you downstairs.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.208
But I just wanted to ask...

13:55.878 --> 13:57.421
Okay.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.464
<i>Why the fuck you still there?</i>

13:59.548 --> 14:02.050
Look, man, I really,
really want this piano, man.

14:02.134 --> 14:03.677
It's nice.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.305
There's colored keys.
And it's free.

14:06.305 --> 14:09.016
<i>But is you willing
to die for it, though, man?</i>

14:09.016 --> 14:10.601
I mean, he sound like
a serial killer.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.478
And let me get a five cheese
Krystal combo, no fries.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.563
<i>It's cheaper with fries.</i>

14:14.563 --> 14:17.024
- No fries.
- That's rich nigga shit, man.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.233
You don't know
nothing about that.

14:18.317 --> 14:21.445
<i>Look, man,
if I leave, I'll regret it.</i>

14:21.445 --> 14:23.405
And I got a two regret
life limit pact.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.781
Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.283
A what?

14:26.283 --> 14:28.952
A two regret life limit pact.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.288
Somebody got to take me out
if I go over two.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.916
<i>What?
How would anyone know</i>

14:33.916 --> 14:35.542
<i>you went over two regrets?</i>

14:35.626 --> 14:37.252
I'd tell them.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.379
Look...
Oh, shit.

14:39.463 --> 14:40.797
Paper Boi!

14:40.881 --> 14:43.175
I mean, the dude
is obviously a weirdo, man.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.718
Look, now just play along
with it,

14:44.718 --> 14:46.220
get the piano,
get the hell up out.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.513
Yeah, but how, though, man?

14:47.513 --> 14:48.805
I feel like...

14:48.889 --> 14:51.183
like he stalling or something.

14:51.183 --> 14:52.643
Like he want to keep me here.

14:52.643 --> 14:54.102
<i>Explain again, man.</i>

14:54.186 --> 14:55.979
Is Teddy the white dude
or the black dude?

14:56.063 --> 14:58.190
<i>You know what? I don't
even think Teddy exists, bro.</i>

14:58.190 --> 14:59.608
<i>I feel like</i>

14:59.608 --> 15:01.735
Benny created Teddy
to make up for the fact

15:01.735 --> 15:03.529
that he made himself
look like a ghoul.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.780
<i>A ghoul?</i>

15:04.780 --> 15:06.198
<i>I mean, how bad is he?</i>

15:06.198 --> 15:07.574
It's real bad, man.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.368
I mean, bad.

15:09.368 --> 15:12.579
The nigga look like somebody
left Sammy Sosa in the dryer.

15:12.663 --> 15:14.331
<i>Sammy Sosa?</i>

15:14.331 --> 15:16.917
<i>Yeah.
Skin bleaching?</i>

15:16.917 --> 15:18.460
<i>Look, have somebody
type in, um,</i>

15:18.544 --> 15:19.586
<i>"Sammy Sosa hat"
in Google image search.</i>

15:19.670 --> 15:21.171
Hey, man, look, man.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.423
Sometimes, people come over,
they want a quarter,

15:23.507 --> 15:25.175
and they feel like
they can sit and chat and shit.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.010
But other people,
you know what I'm saying, like,

15:27.094 --> 15:28.929
they want an eighth, they pay
me, and they get the hell on.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.556
- Can I take a flick? To Laurence.
- Look, man...

15:30.556 --> 15:32.474
- Say happy birthday, Laurence.
- That's how I know

15:32.558 --> 15:34.142
- that I'm simply a conduit...
- This nigga gonna stunt on me

15:34.226 --> 15:35.769
- with the new iPhone.
- ...between them and their weed.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.688
See, keep gunning,
and he ain't got no choice

15:37.688 --> 15:40.148
but to make clear
what he want from you.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.234
I see what you're saying.
I see, I see what you're...

15:42.234 --> 15:43.610
you're saying
be unequivocally honest

15:43.694 --> 15:46.530
to make a healthy transaction.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.323
Wow, man, you know what?

15:48.407 --> 15:50.701
You keep this up, you could be
the next Steve Harvey, bro.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.536
Steve Harvey, nigga?
No, no, no.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.788
I'm-I'm like Dr. Phil,
you know what I'm saying?

15:54.872 --> 15:56.790
- Yo.
- Hell, that, that nigga stay caked up.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.792
- Yo! Shit!
- What the...?

15:58.876 --> 16:00.627
Oh, shit! Oh!

16:00.711 --> 16:02.045
- What happened?
- Yo!

16:03.839 --> 16:06.258
<i>Yo, why this nigga the same
color as his fucking hat?</i>

16:08.135 --> 16:10.679
<i>Yeah, man, this nigga
look like a white man's penis.</i>

16:10.679 --> 16:13.348
Yo, man,

16:13.432 --> 16:15.893
why this nigga look like
what's <i>under</i> a scab, though?

16:18.729 --> 16:20.689
- Goddamn.
- Oh, God.

16:20.689 --> 16:21.899
Peace, man.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.066
<i>All right, peace.</i>

16:23.150 --> 16:24.359
Oh, God.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.155
Put some extra fries in there.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.782
- Take 'em out.
- Just don't eat 'em. Damn.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.035
Oh, man.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.328
Hmm.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.187
Ugh.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.897
Surprise.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.857
Shit.
Yeah, I'm...

17:03.941 --> 17:06.485
I'm not a big photo person.

17:06.485 --> 17:08.111
Apologies.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.949
Um, this is yours, anyway.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.659
I got you your water.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.869
Oh, yes, thank you.

17:15.953 --> 17:18.205
I needed that.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.419
Hmm.

17:25.462 --> 17:28.799
Oh. That's cool.

17:28.799 --> 17:33.136
Feel free to take any of it.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.429
Yeah.

17:39.268 --> 17:41.270
What is this place, man?

17:41.270 --> 17:43.272
It's a gift shop.

17:43.272 --> 17:47.276
I designed it myself to feel...
like a trophy room.

17:47.276 --> 17:49.611
More in the motif of the museum.

17:49.695 --> 17:52.239
Oh, wait, so you're turning
this whole place into a museum?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.867
Yes. I've already started
the process

17:54.867 --> 17:57.369
of making this
a historical site.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.163
You're actually the first person
to be in here.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.875
Feel free to Twitter
or blogspot any of it.

18:02.875 --> 18:05.919
Uh, you know what, actually,
I'm kind of in a rush, uh...

18:06.003 --> 18:09.256
May I show you something? Um...

18:09.256 --> 18:11.175
I-I promise to get you
your piano.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.886
I... I really think you'll like

18:13.886 --> 18:16.180
what I have in store.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.809
Sure.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.025
What's in there?

18:28.025 --> 18:29.443
Go ahead.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.528
Walk in.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.284
Okay.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.707
Hey, uh, Teddy?

18:43.707 --> 18:45.542
Uh...

18:45.626 --> 18:48.337
This is my favorite part
of the museum.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.758
What the hell is this?

18:52.758 --> 18:54.468
This is my father.

18:54.468 --> 18:57.930
He's the reason for all of this.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.517
When me and Benny were children,

19:01.517 --> 19:03.936
he instituted
a very rigorous training method.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.771
Piano three hours a day,

19:05.771 --> 19:07.481
twice a day.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.191
With exams on Sundays,

19:09.191 --> 19:13.237
that, if failed,

19:13.237 --> 19:16.740
meant physical punishment.

19:16.740 --> 19:20.494
He wanted the best out of us.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.498
It's because of him
we have all of this.

19:24.498 --> 19:27.459
So you said your dad,
uh, used to beat you

19:27.543 --> 19:29.169
so you'd be good at piano?

19:29.253 --> 19:31.171
To be good at life.

19:31.255 --> 19:34.466
We were his sacrifice.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.885
Oh. Well, um, I'm not trying

19:36.969 --> 19:38.595
to, like, shit on your dad,
or nothing, man,

19:38.679 --> 19:41.348
but that seems
a little... unnecessary.

19:43.308 --> 19:46.854
Most people wouldn't understand.

19:46.854 --> 19:50.232
To make an omelet,
you have to break a few eggs.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.818
I mean, to build bridges,
people have to fall.

19:52.818 --> 19:54.611
Are you not mad at your dad?

19:54.695 --> 19:57.072
Of course not.

19:57.072 --> 20:01.034
There was no way for a child
to understand what was at stake.

20:01.118 --> 20:04.913
He just wanted the best for us.

20:04.997 --> 20:07.708
My father used to say,

20:07.708 --> 20:11.587
"Great things
come from great pain."

20:15.048 --> 20:17.634
I want this wing of the museum

20:17.718 --> 20:20.637
to be dedicated
to great fathers.

20:20.721 --> 20:23.724
My father, Joe Jackson,

20:23.724 --> 20:26.018
Marvin Gay Sr...

20:26.018 --> 20:28.353
...Tiger Woods's father,

20:28.437 --> 20:31.064
Serena Williams's father,

20:31.148 --> 20:33.483
the father that drops off

20:33.567 --> 20:35.068
Emilio Estevez
in <i>The Breakfast Club.</i>

20:35.152 --> 20:37.029
Hey, uh, look, I...

20:37.029 --> 20:38.572
I'd like to make
this transaction

20:38.572 --> 20:40.324
as efficient as possible.

20:40.324 --> 20:43.118
So is there any documents
I got to sign?

20:43.202 --> 20:44.411
For tax purposes?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.416
Of course.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.063
Uh...

21:11.063 --> 21:12.731
Ted?

21:12.731 --> 21:14.942
I'm sure, um,

21:14.942 --> 21:17.194
sorry I can't,
uh, thank Benny himself,

21:17.194 --> 21:18.695
personally, man.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.197
Don't be.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.741
The disease is very advanced,

21:22.741 --> 21:26.995
and he doesn't like people
seeing him that way.

21:28.247 --> 21:31.083
It's a very hard thing.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.501
Yeah.

21:32.501 --> 21:36.171
- I can imagine...
- No, you can't!

21:38.215 --> 21:41.677
You have no idea.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.022
Sign the highlighted parts.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.279
I have to go
turn on the elevator.

22:00.279 --> 22:03.657
When it arrives,

22:03.657 --> 22:06.326
place the piano on it.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.995
I'll wait for you in the lobby.

22:07.995 --> 22:10.122
Okay, well, thanks...

22:21.008 --> 22:23.010
All right, what is this?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.346
The hell?

23:13.602 --> 23:15.562
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Back.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.374
All right.

23:35.374 --> 23:38.418
Fine, destiny.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.828
Shh.

24:28.677 --> 24:31.597
Okay, what do you want me to do?

24:47.529 --> 24:49.907
Come on.
Are you serious?

24:49.907 --> 24:51.742
Uh...

24:51.742 --> 24:55.162
But why can't...
why can't you just get the gun?

24:58.040 --> 25:01.293
Fine. All right.
I'll go get your gun.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.212
But I got to put my piano
in the car first, okay?

25:03.212 --> 25:04.713
So you stay here.

25:04.713 --> 25:07.841
And I'll be back
with your... gun.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.145
<i>ALFRED
Why would he say that, though?</i>

25:20.229 --> 25:23.607
I don't even know, bro.
This dude crazy, bruh.

25:23.607 --> 25:26.777
He want me to kill him,
this dude way past depressed.

25:26.777 --> 25:29.238
This whole situation's
just been weird

25:29.238 --> 25:32.616
since I got here.

25:32.616 --> 25:33.992
Yep. Fuck this shit, bro.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.536
Look, I got the piano.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.913
And I'm just gonna get
the hell up out of...

25:46.588 --> 25:48.465
Let me call you back, bro.

25:51.844 --> 25:54.054
Hey. Hey, Teddy!

25:54.054 --> 25:57.850
Your car is blocking mine.

26:10.946 --> 26:13.532
Teddy?

26:32.092 --> 26:35.137
<i>MAN Come on, Benny,
put something into it.</i>

26:38.807 --> 26:40.058
<i>Posture.</i>

26:41.393 --> 26:43.770
<i>Posture.
Keep your form.</i>

26:47.524 --> 26:49.526
<i>Don't you cry.</i>

26:54.239 --> 26:55.991
<i>Again!</i>

26:57.034 --> 26:59.411
I love this song.
- Oh, shit.

27:04.875 --> 27:05.918
Yeah.

27:05.918 --> 27:09.087
Something wrong?

27:09.171 --> 27:10.589
Uh...

27:10.589 --> 27:12.132
<i>Watch your form.</i>

27:12.216 --> 27:14.426
Yeah.
You-you, uh, parked your car

27:14.510 --> 27:15.969
right in front of mine.

27:16.053 --> 27:17.888
Oh.

27:19.932 --> 27:22.726
I'll move it.

27:24.478 --> 27:25.938
Um...

27:25.938 --> 27:28.315
Anything else?

27:28.315 --> 27:31.109
Uh, where's your, uh,

27:31.193 --> 27:33.195
bath-bathroom?

27:36.365 --> 27:40.035
It's up the stairs.

27:40.035 --> 27:41.954
Third door on your left.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.959
Okay.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.795
Right next to the attic.

27:51.338 --> 27:54.550
I was just up there myself.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.971
Do you know what I found?

28:01.598 --> 28:04.059
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.395
Hey, man. Chill, chill.

28:06.395 --> 28:08.564
Congratulations.

28:08.564 --> 28:11.400
For-for what?

28:14.611 --> 28:17.030
I choose you.

28:17.114 --> 28:20.284
You're my sacrifice.

28:21.743 --> 28:25.080
Put your phone on the ground.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.964
No.

28:33.964 --> 28:36.675
Keep that.

28:36.675 --> 28:39.928
I want it to look real.

28:40.012 --> 28:43.056
Want what to look real?

28:43.140 --> 28:44.766
The home invasion.

28:44.850 --> 28:46.351
You killed Benny
because you were obsessed.

28:46.435 --> 28:47.978
No, man. You...

28:47.978 --> 28:50.189
Look, there is no
fucking Benny, all right?

28:50.189 --> 28:51.690
Exactly.

28:55.068 --> 28:58.030
Exactly.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.868
Sit in the chair.

29:22.012 --> 29:24.014
Put them on.

29:24.014 --> 29:26.183
Ankles first.

29:49.331 --> 29:52.167
You know, uh,
not all great things

29:52.251 --> 29:55.337
come from great pain.

29:55.337 --> 29:57.339
Sometimes it's love.

29:57.339 --> 30:01.468
Not everything's a sacrifice.

30:01.552 --> 30:05.305
Sacrifices are necessary, Darius.

30:05.389 --> 30:07.808
Yeah, maybe.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.812
But your dad
should have said sorry.

30:14.815 --> 30:18.068
I'm sorry.

30:18.068 --> 30:20.821
Shit.

30:20.821 --> 30:23.532
I went through daddy shit myself.

30:23.532 --> 30:26.493
But when you're young,
you try to just...

30:26.577 --> 30:28.829
make it be okay and say
everything's gonna be fine.

30:28.829 --> 30:30.372
And that's just,

30:30.372 --> 30:32.583
you don't know the difference, but...

30:32.583 --> 30:34.376
that don't give you an excuse
to grow up

30:34.376 --> 30:37.588
and repeat the same shit
over and over.

30:37.588 --> 30:40.883
It's like there's a...
there's a "what if" factor.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.926
What if you would have

30:43.010 --> 30:45.179
been great at something else?

30:45.179 --> 30:48.765
Or if you would have
seen love...

30:48.849 --> 30:52.144
instead of all the other shit
like... like Stevie.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.980
I'm sorry?

30:54.980 --> 30:57.316
Stevie Wonder.

30:57.316 --> 31:00.235
Stevie had his own...

31:00.319 --> 31:01.612
sacrifices.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.530
He was blind.

31:03.614 --> 31:07.492
Yeah, but he wasn't <i>blinded.</i>

31:07.576 --> 31:10.204
He saw through his music.

31:11.914 --> 31:14.833
That's beautiful...

31:20.130 --> 31:21.715
...but wrong.

31:35.771 --> 31:37.523
Benny.

31:37.523 --> 31:39.608
You're alive.

31:43.403 --> 31:44.488
Shit!

31:47.741 --> 31:49.159
Fuck.

31:55.165 --> 31:57.918
Benny, uh, look.
I'm sorry that you

31:57.918 --> 32:00.295
had to go through what you
had to go through, man.

32:00.379 --> 32:01.964
It...

32:01.964 --> 32:03.507
What?

32:03.507 --> 32:05.968
Oh.

32:10.681 --> 32:12.850
Wait, Benny, what are you,
what are you do...?

32:12.850 --> 32:14.768
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:14.852 --> 32:16.895
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, shit!

32:16.979 --> 32:19.314
Oh! Fuck.

32:19.398 --> 32:22.109
Oh, shit. Goddamn it.

32:25.863 --> 32:27.698
Ugh.
