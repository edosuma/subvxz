WEBVTT

00:01.894 --> 00:04.211
(acoustic guitar playing)

00:07.566 --> 00:09.842
Hey, Paul, what are you
doing down here?

00:09.844 --> 00:11.084
Ah, just catching up
with a friend.

00:11.086 --> 00:13.345
That wouldn't happen
to be Marwani, would it?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.830
Uh, no, no.
An old friend from Chicago.

00:15.832 --> 00:18.851
Uh, Marwani's, uh,
cell service's a little spotty,
you know,

00:18.853 --> 00:20.335
out there in the desert.

00:20.429 --> 00:23.430
She give you any indication
when she might be coming home?

00:23.432 --> 00:26.266
Nah. I think she's still
trying to figure that out.

00:26.268 --> 00:27.067
Right.

00:29.012 --> 00:32.105
-(cell phone chimes)
-So what's got you wandering
the halls tonight, Cap?

00:32.107 --> 00:33.532
-(sighs) Work.
-Yeah.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.017
-Heavy is the head, huh?
-(cell phone chimes)

00:36.019 --> 00:37.594
Just not heavy enough
to go to sleep.

00:37.596 --> 00:38.779
-(chuckles)
-(cell phone chimes)

00:38.781 --> 00:39.930
So what is it you got,

00:39.932 --> 00:41.265
IR reports or budget stuff?

00:41.267 --> 00:43.525
No. Wedding plans.

00:43.527 --> 00:46.787
God bless TK and Carlos,
but they're such rookies.

00:46.789 --> 00:49.239
I mean, you survive
two weddings of your own,
you know things, right?

00:49.241 --> 00:50.698
-(cell phone chimes)
-That I bet.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.052
For example...

00:53.054 --> 00:54.444
-centerpieces.
-(cell phone chimes)

00:54.446 --> 00:56.055
OWEN STRAND:
They have to anchor the table.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.039
Whoever that is
is blowing your phone up, man.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.132
Oh. (chuckles)

00:59.134 --> 01:00.300
Yeah, no, she's on an epic tear

01:00.302 --> 01:01.876
about<i> The Bachelor</i> right now.

01:01.878 --> 01:02.895
Oh, "she."

01:02.897 --> 01:03.896
Oh, so it might be

01:03.898 --> 01:05.138
more than a friend-friend.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.474
Uh, no, I don't see
that happening, Cap.

01:07.476 --> 01:08.383
Take my advice.

01:08.644 --> 01:10.069
If someone makes you
light up like that,

01:10.071 --> 01:11.570
make it happen.

01:12.464 --> 01:14.131
No, no, thanks,

01:14.133 --> 01:15.482
but I can't do that, Cap.

01:15.484 --> 01:16.483
Why not?

01:16.485 --> 01:18.059
-(door opens)
-MAN: Anybody here?

01:18.061 --> 01:19.411
-WOMAN: Hello!
-MAN: I need help!

01:19.413 --> 01:22.247
See, Jerry, I told you
they were open 24 hours.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.991
Hi, I'm Hannah.
This is my husband Jerry.

01:24.993 --> 01:26.401
Yeah. Uh, how you doing?

01:26.403 --> 01:27.811
-She can't walk.
-PAUL STRICKLAND: Uh-huh.

01:27.813 --> 01:30.422
So you strapped her upside down
to a refrigerator dolly?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.257
I wasn't gonna
try and carry her

01:32.259 --> 01:33.483
by her ankles
for six blocks.

01:33.485 --> 01:35.319
So I'm assuming
you don't have a car.

01:35.321 --> 01:36.595
How can I keep her
upside down in a car?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.414
Okay, look, keeping somebody
upside down like this,

01:39.416 --> 01:40.991
barring certain yoga positions,
is very dangerous.

01:40.993 --> 01:42.101
-So I suggest that we--
-HANNAH: No!

01:42.328 --> 01:44.010
JERRY:
No, no, no! You can't.
You'll kill her.

01:44.012 --> 01:46.087
She's having a...
um, a medical emergency.

01:46.089 --> 01:47.439
HANNAH: He's right.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.016
If you turn me right-side up,
I'll die again.

01:50.018 --> 01:52.686
Now, when you say "again"...

01:52.688 --> 01:54.095
BP's 120 over 60.

01:54.097 --> 01:55.672
Heart rate's 65, Cap.

01:55.674 --> 01:56.690
Is that bad?

01:56.692 --> 01:58.117
No, it's totally normal,

01:58.119 --> 01:59.843
actually, which is surprising.

01:59.845 --> 02:01.769
How long has she been
upside in this position?

02:01.771 --> 02:03.029
Uh, half an hour, maybe.

02:03.031 --> 02:04.939
Could you tell us
what y'all were doing

02:04.941 --> 02:06.274
before the symptoms started?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.685
There were no symptoms.
She just kept dropping dead.

02:08.687 --> 02:12.706
And what were you doing
when she first dropped dead?

02:12.708 --> 02:14.858
We were, uh, in bed.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.284
In-in bed sleeping or--

02:16.286 --> 02:17.761
We were engaged in, uh...

02:19.398 --> 02:21.789
-You know.
-Oh, for the love of God, Jerry.

02:21.791 --> 02:22.866
They're all adults here.

02:22.868 --> 02:23.958
We were having intercourse

02:23.960 --> 02:24.718
and I blacked out.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.644
JERRY:
Her heart stopped.

02:25.962 --> 02:28.129
So I tried to move her
to the floor for CPR

02:28.131 --> 02:29.539
and she slipped off the bed.

02:29.633 --> 02:31.224
The second her head
was upside down,
she woke up again.

02:31.226 --> 02:32.317
And then everything was fine

02:32.319 --> 02:33.986
until I tried to stand up again.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.154
-And then she died.
-Again.

02:35.156 --> 02:37.214
I had tried CPR again,
didn't work.

02:37.216 --> 02:39.049
So I grabbed her
by her legs and yanked.

02:39.051 --> 02:40.975
And I came back to life again.

02:40.977 --> 02:43.144
Alright, Nancy, TK,
go grab the gurney.

02:43.146 --> 02:43.996
NANCY GILLIAN:
Copy.

02:43.998 --> 02:44.905
TOMMY VEGA:
Uh, Hannah,

02:44.907 --> 02:45.831
I'm gonna lay you down flat

02:45.833 --> 02:47.148
so that I can better assess

02:47.150 --> 02:48.241
what's going on.

02:48.243 --> 02:49.484
No! You can't. You'll kill her.

02:49.486 --> 02:50.836
No, no, it's okay.
We'll be gentle.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.912
Her vitals are strong.

02:51.914 --> 02:53.246
I think she'll be just fine.

02:53.248 --> 02:55.841
I'm just not sure that
what appears to be happening

02:55.843 --> 02:57.250
is what's actually happening.

02:57.252 --> 03:00.179
Jerry, sweetie, we have
to trust them, okay?

03:00.181 --> 03:01.755
Captain Strand,
can I have some help?

03:01.757 --> 03:02.664
-Guys.
-TOMMY: Yep.

03:02.666 --> 03:03.498
Alright, we're gonna lay

03:03.500 --> 03:04.607
the dolly down flat,

03:04.743 --> 03:05.926
and then we're gonna
move her to the gurney.

03:05.928 --> 03:07.394
Alright, on three.

03:07.930 --> 03:10.080
One, two, three.

03:10.082 --> 03:11.148
(monitor beeping)

03:12.342 --> 03:14.601
-(flatline)
-Syncope. I lost her heartbeat.

03:14.603 --> 03:15.936
(flatline)

03:15.938 --> 03:17.254
-I told you!
-Alright, forget the gurney.

03:17.256 --> 03:18.488
Just get it back up.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.032
(groans weakly)

03:20.034 --> 03:21.200
(monitor beeping)

03:21.202 --> 03:22.259
Did it happen again?

03:22.261 --> 03:24.261
You see?
What's wrong with her?

03:24.263 --> 03:26.263
(sighs) Uh...
I, I don't know.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.098
Hey, you don't think
this could have to do

03:28.100 --> 03:29.541
with my pacemaker, do you?

03:31.103 --> 03:33.069
-You have a pacemaker?
-I didn't mention that?

03:33.071 --> 03:34.120
No, you didn't.

03:34.122 --> 03:35.363
Alright. How long
have you had it?

03:35.365 --> 03:36.698
HANNAH:
Uh, about a year.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.717
But the doctor said
that it would last ten years.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.220
As long as it stays connected
to the ventricle in your heart.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.281
I'm thinking that your
bedroom activities tonight

03:44.283 --> 03:45.465
might have dislodged the wiring.

03:45.467 --> 03:47.059
And then when
you're upside down,

03:47.061 --> 03:49.228
everything falls back
into place again.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.471
-So how do you fix it?
-I don't.

03:51.473 --> 03:53.139
We need to get her
to a hospital.

03:53.141 --> 03:54.958
Cap, our, our rig
isn't tall enough for us

03:54.960 --> 03:55.792
to transport her upside down.

03:55.794 --> 03:57.127
She can ride with us.

03:57.129 --> 03:59.071
She ain't gonna fit
in the fire truck either, Cap.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.989
She's not gonna ride in the rig.

04:02.801 --> 04:05.727
(siren wailing)

04:05.729 --> 04:07.371
(horn blaring)

04:15.163 --> 04:18.832
(theme music plays)

04:18.834 --> 04:20.166
Okay, now, the YouTube lady said

04:20.168 --> 04:23.077
to wait until the exact moment
that the top layer

04:23.079 --> 04:24.988
turns a crispy autumn gold.

04:24.990 --> 04:25.764
What do you think?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.840
Looks pretty golden to me.

04:26.842 --> 04:28.600
Eh, well, looks more

04:28.602 --> 04:29.935
egg-yolk yellow gold, right?

04:30.162 --> 04:32.938
I should... probably put it
back in for a few more minutes?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.064
Okay.

04:35.834 --> 04:37.759
I'm just worried

04:37.761 --> 04:40.504
that any longer and the crispy
will turn to crunchy,

04:40.506 --> 04:43.690
and nobody wants
a crunchy lasagna, right?

04:43.692 --> 04:44.932
-Trevor.
-Yeah?

04:44.934 --> 04:46.285
Do me a favor.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.661
Take off your oven mitts.

04:51.683 --> 04:53.366
Hold my hand.

04:53.368 --> 04:56.019
Take a deep breath in
through your nose.

04:56.021 --> 04:57.278
(both inhale)

04:57.280 --> 04:58.630
Out through your mouth.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.632
(both exhale)

05:00.634 --> 05:02.467
Just breathe.

05:04.029 --> 05:06.530
-(exhales)
-Okay. Better?

05:06.532 --> 05:07.472
Hmm.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.032
(chuckles) Okay.

05:09.034 --> 05:11.959
Alright, listen, you got this.

05:11.961 --> 05:13.127
-Yeah? Listen.
-(girls laughing)

05:13.129 --> 05:13.979
Do you hear that?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.981
(chuckling continues)

05:15.983 --> 05:18.800
That's laughter.
That's a good sign.

05:18.802 --> 05:21.394
We always knew our children
would get along with each other.

05:21.396 --> 05:24.564
The scary part is what happens
when we tell them about us.

05:24.566 --> 05:26.474
You've got nothing
to worry about.

05:26.476 --> 05:28.401
My girls love you.

05:28.403 --> 05:30.495
And they've
never been this excited

05:30.497 --> 05:31.330
about going to church.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.073
I think that has more to do with

05:33.075 --> 05:35.500
my new Youth Director, Cory.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.318
Oh, Cory.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.113
-Definitely helps.
-(Trevor laughs)

05:40.115 --> 05:42.415
But they think the world
of Pastor Trevor.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.659
Yeah, well, "Pastor Trevor"
is a lot different

05:44.661 --> 05:47.495
than "my mom's
new boyfriend Trevor."

05:47.497 --> 05:48.388
(chuckles)

05:48.832 --> 05:50.164
Crap.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.333
Is that even the right label?
Do we want a label?

05:52.335 --> 05:54.077
Because I don't wanna
rush anything--

05:54.079 --> 05:56.079
Okay, stop.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.689
It's the first time
I heard it out loud.

05:59.918 --> 06:01.276
Boyfriend sounds nice.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.695
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:06.091 --> 06:07.699
-(girls laughing)
-Okay, now...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.609
Do you have any tips for me?

06:09.611 --> 06:13.597
I mean, something I can,
you know, score some points
with Melody?

06:13.599 --> 06:15.281
You already saved my life
in front of her,

06:15.283 --> 06:18.101
so that gives you
a pretty good head start.

06:18.103 --> 06:20.770
Good. So we're doing this?

06:20.772 --> 06:21.771
-Yeah.
-We're doing this.

06:21.773 --> 06:23.197
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.867
You know what? I'm just gonna
pop this back in the oven--

06:25.869 --> 06:27.302
Yeah, girls, dinner.

06:28.947 --> 06:30.280
I'm so full.

06:30.282 --> 06:31.965
I feel like I have
a little lasagna baby.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.408
Could it be twins?

06:33.410 --> 06:35.519
IZZY VEGA:
Don't encourage her.

06:36.805 --> 06:39.398
Well, uh, ladies, we, um...

06:39.400 --> 06:42.067
we have something
we wanna tell you.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.477
We've really enjoyed
spending time together.

06:44.479 --> 06:46.905
And we're interested
in making our relationship,

06:46.907 --> 06:48.965
uh, more formal.

06:48.967 --> 06:52.469
So like boyfriend, girlfriend?

06:52.471 --> 06:54.413
But only if you're
okay with that.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.307
I know, uh, Pastor Trevor
is the first guy I brought home

06:57.309 --> 06:59.233
since your dad passed away.

06:59.235 --> 07:01.086
What about Julius?

07:01.088 --> 07:03.830
Yeah, he lived with us.

07:03.832 --> 07:04.756
Julius?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.925
Uh, their Uncle Julius.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.176
Ah. (chuckles)

07:09.596 --> 07:12.489
Uh, well, listen, if you guys
have a problem with it--

07:12.491 --> 07:15.600
Does this mean we get
a better parking spot at church?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.312
-(Trevor laughs)
-N... No.

07:19.998 --> 07:21.164
No, Izzy.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.516
Okay. I'm still cool with it.

07:23.518 --> 07:24.443
Me, too.

07:25.837 --> 07:26.820
Just don't break her heart.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.490
I will treat it like
the treasure that it is.

07:31.267 --> 07:32.358
Mel?

07:32.360 --> 07:35.328
I'm happy for you guys.
You deserve it.

07:36.698 --> 07:37.956
TREVOR: Well, alright!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.182
Who wants to celebrate

07:39.184 --> 07:40.959
by having
some apple pie a la mode?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.961
-BOTH: I do.
-(Tommy laughs)

07:42.963 --> 07:44.278
-Great.
-Mel?

07:44.280 --> 07:46.039
MELODY:
No, thanks, I'm stuffed.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.223
-TREVOR: Alright.
-Alright, help that man

07:47.225 --> 07:48.633
scoop some ice cream now.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.051
(Trevor chuckles)

07:52.030 --> 07:53.213
Oh.

07:53.215 --> 07:55.623
Melody, I am so excited.

07:55.625 --> 07:59.869
I, I just, I know that we're
gonna have so much fun together.

07:59.871 --> 08:01.396
I don't.

08:02.541 --> 08:03.565
(chuckles)

08:05.319 --> 08:06.985
Oh.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.729
(sighs) You're not joking,
are you?

08:09.731 --> 08:11.531
No, I'm not.

08:12.141 --> 08:12.991
Uh...

08:12.993 --> 08:16.386
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

08:16.388 --> 08:19.647
You have to break up with him
before this goes any further.

08:19.649 --> 08:20.999
Okay, honey, um,

08:21.001 --> 08:23.059
that sounds like
you're giving me an ultimatum.

08:23.061 --> 08:24.744
We can either
end this your way

08:24.746 --> 08:26.004
or we can end it my way.

08:27.566 --> 08:29.174
You have till tomorrow.

08:29.693 --> 08:30.717
Huh...

08:41.263 --> 08:43.763
"We can end it your way
or we can end it my way"?

08:43.765 --> 08:45.265
Those are the exact words
that she said?

08:45.267 --> 08:47.767
Yeah. With a day to decide.

08:47.769 --> 08:49.361
Holy smokes.

08:49.363 --> 08:52.422
So just so I'm clear,
this is little sweet Melody

08:52.424 --> 08:53.940
who sings in
the children's choir?

08:53.942 --> 08:55.200
The same.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.352
No. See, she's innocent
and sweet on the outside,

08:58.354 --> 09:00.613
inside there lurks
a heart of darkness.

09:00.615 --> 09:02.932
What she is...

09:02.934 --> 09:03.875
is a Bad Seed.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.268
Well, Judd, don't talk about

09:05.270 --> 09:07.028
the pastor's daughter like that.

09:07.030 --> 09:08.380
And she's not a Bad Seed.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.531
She's just been through a lot.

09:10.533 --> 09:13.885
I know. I remember
what I was like
when my parents separated.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.296
I didn't come out of my room
for a month.

09:16.298 --> 09:19.724
I'm trying to be sensitive
about this, I am.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.226
I mean, the last thing I need

09:21.228 --> 09:23.136
is to be at war with
my new boyfriend's daughter.

09:23.138 --> 09:24.396
Might be too late.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.565
She already fired the first shot
across the bow.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.975
You know what?
We're supposed
to go out tonight,

09:28.977 --> 09:29.976
and I'm just, I'm gonna call,

09:29.978 --> 09:31.628
I'm gonna call
and just cancel it.

09:31.630 --> 09:33.071
Mm... No, ma'am.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.314
You will do no such thing.

09:34.316 --> 09:36.983
You will keep the date
and you'll tell him

09:36.985 --> 09:39.077
what she told you face-to-face.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.987
And just do it with
love and compassion

09:40.989 --> 09:42.497
and it'll be fine.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.417
(steam hissing)

09:45.419 --> 09:49.421
Okay, now the secret
is a smooth, steady pour

09:50.740 --> 09:52.941
with a deft flick of the wrist.

09:52.943 --> 09:55.093
And<i> voilà,</i> a heart.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.878
-(Paul giggling)
-Uh, dude, no offense,

09:56.880 --> 09:58.079
but that doesn't
look like a heart.

09:58.081 --> 09:59.823
PAUL:
Yeah, man, it looks like a butt.

09:59.825 --> 10:01.658
Or a set of boobies.

10:01.660 --> 10:04.227
Yeah, yeah,
that foam is definitely
not safe for work, bro.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.847
Everybody,
you remember Asha Fulton.

10:07.849 --> 10:10.850
Oh, great.
The HR lady again.

10:10.852 --> 10:13.094
Hey, Miss Fulton.
How you doing?

10:13.096 --> 10:14.838
Very well,
Firefighter Strickland.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.022
Thanks for asking.

10:16.024 --> 10:18.191
Uh, or the record, um,
these weren't boobies.

10:18.193 --> 10:19.676
It was supposed to be a heart.

10:19.678 --> 10:22.103
Mateo, she's here to close out
the first investigation,

10:22.105 --> 10:23.771
not launch a new one.

10:23.773 --> 10:24.939
Wait. Close out?

10:25.033 --> 10:27.033
Does that mean that
Marjan isn't coming back?

10:27.035 --> 10:28.960
The Geralds dropped
their frivolous suit

10:28.962 --> 10:30.370
against the department.

10:30.372 --> 10:32.279
Their attempt
to blackmail us fell apart

10:32.281 --> 10:35.116
after Firefighter Marwani
took such a public stand.

10:35.118 --> 10:37.043
-That's amazing.
-Oh, we've got to tell Marj!

10:37.045 --> 10:38.470
Oh, no, she already knows.
I told her.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.971
Oh. Oh.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.140
Hey, how did
you know already?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.291
-Oh...
-Uh, Captain Strand,
is it okay

10:44.293 --> 10:46.144
if we head up to your office
to go over the paperwork?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.887
Sure. Would you like
an almond milk espresso?

10:47.889 --> 10:49.731
No, no, no, no.
She has a nut allergy.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.802
Uh, I-I'm guessing
that she has a nut allergy.

10:54.804 --> 10:56.154
Good guess.

10:56.156 --> 10:59.449
Uh, well, it was lovely
seeing you all again.

11:00.051 --> 11:01.201
Captain.

11:06.683 --> 11:07.540
(Nancy clears throat)

11:12.564 --> 11:13.730
What?

11:13.732 --> 11:15.006
You're dating the HR lady.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.341
I am not.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.067
How'd you know about
her food allergies?

11:18.069 --> 11:19.419
Wait, do HR ladies
actually date?

11:19.421 --> 11:20.753
Yeah, of course they do.

11:20.997 --> 11:23.573
And she's not a HR lady, okay?
She's the department advocate--

11:23.575 --> 11:25.408
Advocate for
the blah, blah, blah. Got it.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.760
There is definitely something
that just happened here.

11:27.762 --> 11:28.912
Did you feel that?

11:28.914 --> 11:30.596
Oh, yeah.
Like actual sparks.

11:30.598 --> 11:31.606
(sighs)

11:32.918 --> 11:34.417
Okay, fine.

11:34.419 --> 11:36.343
So, you know,
the thing that was going on

11:36.345 --> 11:38.438
is that we actually
know each other.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.198
Turns out we went
to school together.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.866
-You mean college?
-No, in grade school.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.260
-Back in Chicago.
-Whoa.

11:44.262 --> 11:46.279
And you recognized her
from grade school?

11:46.281 --> 11:48.765
Actually, she recognized me.

11:48.767 --> 11:49.432
Wow!

11:49.434 --> 11:50.524
Right? I mean...

11:50.860 --> 11:53.119
Uh, so, anyway, we've sort of
just been reconnecting.

11:53.121 --> 11:54.954
Mostly texting,
but that is about it.

11:54.956 --> 11:57.031
Okay? It goes
no further than that.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.291
Why the hell not?

11:58.293 --> 12:01.052
She's gorgeous
and super into you.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.369
Yeah, dude, it's like destiny.

12:02.371 --> 12:05.056
(scoffs)
It is not destiny.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.115
Wait, you really think
she's into me?

12:06.117 --> 12:07.559
-TK STRAND: Oh, yeah.
-Clearly.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.895
Yeah, you should totally
take her out for
some nut-free coffee.

12:10.897 --> 12:11.896
Exactly.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.315
♪

12:21.241 --> 12:22.323
(sighs)

12:32.753 --> 12:34.811
(doorbell chimes)

12:34.813 --> 12:35.995
Sword and Slices.

12:35.997 --> 12:39.299
A bounty forged in stone
delivered to your home.

12:43.913 --> 12:45.597
Don't make me do this.

12:46.825 --> 12:48.825
(doorbell chimes)

12:48.827 --> 12:50.918
Is the maiden of the castle in?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.688
Your bounty awaits, m'lady.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.182
(sighs)

12:56.184 --> 12:58.425
Come on. Valerie?

12:58.427 --> 13:01.321
I got your
fennel and mushroom
out here. Come on.

13:02.765 --> 13:04.240
Is anybody home?

13:06.861 --> 13:07.994
Oh, my God.

13:14.686 --> 13:16.294
GRACE RYDER:
Okay, I'm sending
an ambulance now.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.037
Sir, listen,
I need you to clear away

13:18.039 --> 13:19.539
anything hard or sharp nearby

13:19.541 --> 13:22.449
and gently turn her on her side
to protect her airway.

13:22.451 --> 13:23.376
I-I'm outside.

13:23.528 --> 13:24.952
I was just delivering
a pizza here

13:24.954 --> 13:26.805
<i> and I-I saw her</i>
<i> through the window.</i>

13:26.807 --> 13:27.955
Okay, and what's your name?

13:27.957 --> 13:29.974
Lance. I-I work at
Swords and Slices.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.717
Okay. I want you
to try the front door.

13:31.719 --> 13:33.127
See if it's unlocked.

13:33.129 --> 13:34.562
Yeah, it's definitely locked.

13:35.798 --> 13:37.131
Oh, no, she stopped moving.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.058
-Valerie! Valerie, wake up!
-(knocking on door)

13:39.060 --> 13:40.893
Sir, do you know the resident?

13:40.895 --> 13:43.062
Uh, I-- No, not really.

13:43.064 --> 13:44.471
I-I deliver a pizza here
every week,

13:44.473 --> 13:46.883
<i> but I usually just</i>
<i> leave it on the stoop.</i>

13:46.885 --> 13:47.884
I-I think she's a shut-in.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.310
<i> She always says,</i>
<i> "Thank you, brave knight"</i>

13:49.312 --> 13:52.055
through the intercom
and then Venmos me a tip.

13:52.057 --> 13:53.239
From what I'm seeing here,

13:53.241 --> 13:55.816
Valerie wears
a medic-alert bracelet.

13:55.818 --> 13:57.001
She's a type-one diabetic,

13:57.003 --> 13:59.412
which means she could be
having an insulin crash.

13:59.414 --> 14:01.564
I swear I got
the pizza here on time.

14:01.566 --> 14:03.824
If she's going into a coma,
she doesn't have a lot of time.

14:03.826 --> 14:04.992
<i> So, Lance, listen.</i>

14:04.994 --> 14:07.345
I'm gonna need you
to break into the house.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.495
Break in?
Isn't that illegal?

14:08.497 --> 14:10.256
That's okay.
I'm giving you permission.

14:10.258 --> 14:12.241
-You can do that?
-Well, I just did.

14:12.243 --> 14:13.259
Well, what am I
supposed to do?

14:13.261 --> 14:14.686
Break down the door
with my shoulder?

14:14.688 --> 14:15.912
Any chance you play soccer?

14:15.914 --> 14:17.096
Well, I play<i> Pokémon GO.</i>

14:17.098 --> 14:19.006
<i> -Why?</i>
-Okay.

14:19.008 --> 14:20.416
Alright, Lance, um,

14:20.509 --> 14:23.027
I need you to stand three feet
away from the door, okay?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.771
Then kick the heel of your shoe
just above the knob.

14:25.773 --> 14:27.090
That's it?
That's the advice?

14:27.092 --> 14:28.658
Yeah, that's it. Do it.

14:31.262 --> 14:34.097
No. I'm not strong enough.
It's barely even budging.

14:34.099 --> 14:35.206
I need you to hit it
with confidence.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.266
I don't have any confidence!

14:37.268 --> 14:39.785
I'm a 42-year-old
pizza delivery guy.

14:39.787 --> 14:40.861
I-I can't do this.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.213
Alright, Lance, let's stop.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.364
<i> New deal.</i>

14:43.608 --> 14:45.383
We're gonna try
something called a mule kick.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.035
<i> Okay? That should help</i>
<i> you generate enough force.</i>

14:48.037 --> 14:48.945
Now, turn around.

14:48.947 --> 14:50.446
<i> Face away from the door.</i>

14:50.448 --> 14:52.724
-Take a deep breath.
-(exhales) Okay.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.450
Now, that woman, she calls you
a brave knight, right?

14:54.452 --> 14:56.119
<i> So I need you</i>
<i> to prove it to me.</i>

14:56.121 --> 14:57.228
<i> Raise your leg up</i>

14:57.230 --> 15:00.014
and kick back with
as much force as you can.

15:00.016 --> 15:02.191
(heavy breathing)

15:03.962 --> 15:04.977
I did it!

15:04.979 --> 15:05.978
<i> I'm in.</i>

15:05.980 --> 15:07.964
Okay.
Well done, brave knight.

15:07.966 --> 15:09.390
<i> Now, listen, press two fingers</i>

15:09.392 --> 15:11.225
<i> up against her neck</i>
<i> next to her windpipe.</i>

15:11.227 --> 15:13.060
<i> Tell me what you feel.</i>

15:13.062 --> 15:14.895
Uh, her pulse is going
a mile a minute.

15:14.897 --> 15:15.988
Okay, is she clammy?

15:15.990 --> 15:17.807
Uh, I think so.

15:17.809 --> 15:18.583
Alright, yes.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.250
Those are all consistent

15:19.252 --> 15:20.493
with an insulin crash.

15:20.495 --> 15:22.495
Now, hopefully,
she has a glucagon pen.

15:22.497 --> 15:25.739
<i> Lance, I need you</i>
<i> to look around for,</i>
<i> like, a white tube.</i>

15:25.741 --> 15:28.259
It looks like a cigar.
There's a red top on one end.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.670
<i> It's probably in her purse.</i>

15:30.672 --> 15:31.971
LANCE: Found it.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.325
-Found it.
-Pull the red top off.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.102
<i> It's gonna expose</i>
<i> a yellow end.</i>

15:38.104 --> 15:40.012
<i> But be careful,</i>
<i> that's where the needle is.</i>

15:40.014 --> 15:41.046
Okay, now what?

15:41.048 --> 15:43.166
Okay, now push that yellow end

15:43.168 --> 15:45.168
<i> straight down</i>
<i> into her upper arm,</i>

15:45.170 --> 15:47.094
<i> and then just hold it there</i>
<i> until I say so.</i>

15:47.096 --> 15:49.297
Okay. I did it.
How do I know if it's working?

15:49.299 --> 15:50.615
Go ahead and pull the pen out.

15:53.011 --> 15:54.744
Oh, God! She's waking up!

15:56.790 --> 15:58.289
Hi, there.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.417
(crackling)

16:10.119 --> 16:11.636
VALERIE:
<i> And I think I killed him.</i>

16:11.638 --> 16:13.954
412 Fielding Road.

16:13.956 --> 16:15.031
-(Taser crackles)
-Stay down.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.699
Did you already
call an ambulance?

16:16.701 --> 16:18.125
I see one is en route.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.477
No, I didn't call
for an ambulance.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.295
<i> I just woke up</i>
<i> and he was on top of me.</i>

16:21.297 --> 16:22.963
GRACE:
Lance, Lance, what's going on?

16:22.965 --> 16:25.466
-Are you there still?
-Grace.

16:25.468 --> 16:27.652
Your caller's not
at 412 Fielding, is he?

16:27.654 --> 16:28.969
Yeah, he is. Why?

16:28.971 --> 16:30.546
So is mine.

16:30.548 --> 16:32.806
-Can I patch in? Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

16:32.808 --> 16:34.066
-(beeps)
-Lance, is that you?

16:34.068 --> 16:35.218
Lance? No!

16:35.220 --> 16:36.902
Some creep broke into my house

16:36.904 --> 16:38.830
and I stun-gunned him.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.239
Okay.
So you must be Valerie?

16:40.241 --> 16:41.574
Yes. How did you know?

16:41.576 --> 16:43.668
The man you just stun-gunned,
he saved your life.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.987
<i> He was delivering a pizza.</i>
<i> He found you in insulin shock.</i>

16:46.989 --> 16:48.489
<i> I helped him into your home.</i>

16:48.491 --> 16:49.156
Lance?

16:49.158 --> 16:51.901
From Swords and Slices?

16:51.903 --> 16:53.419
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

16:53.421 --> 16:54.587
Is he moving at all?

16:54.589 --> 16:57.164
No. I mean, his finger
was twitching a little,

16:57.166 --> 16:59.075
and then I zapped him again.

16:59.077 --> 17:00.243
Okay, Valerie,
I need you to check

17:00.245 --> 17:01.686
to make sure
he's breathing still.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.355
I don't think he is.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.673
And there's no pulse either.

17:06.675 --> 17:09.861
Okay, listen, Valerie,
the paramedics are almost there.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.011
Do you know CPR?

17:11.013 --> 17:12.363
Yeah. Yeah, I took
a class online.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.198
GRACE:
<i> We're gonna do</i>
<i> 30 compressions, okay?</i>

17:14.200 --> 17:16.108
VALERIE:
This is why
I never leave my home

17:16.110 --> 17:18.110
<i> so bad things won't happen.</i>

17:18.112 --> 17:19.537
Well, in my experience,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.188
they have a way
of finding you all the same.

17:21.190 --> 17:22.373
<i> You're doing great</i>
<i> though, Valerie.</i>

17:22.375 --> 17:24.433
Please don't die, Lance.
I'm so sorry.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.860
Alright, Valerie,
my team just landed.

17:26.862 --> 17:28.195
-TOMMY: Ma'am?
-They're here.

17:28.197 --> 17:29.455
Okay. Alright.
We need you to move.

17:29.457 --> 17:31.698
Make some space for us.
You did great.

17:31.700 --> 17:32.866
TK, get his shirt open.

17:32.868 --> 17:33.943
Nancy, ready the paddles.

17:33.945 --> 17:35.428
TK AND NANCY: Copy.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.557
NANCY: Clear!

17:39.559 --> 17:40.783
(thuds)

17:40.785 --> 17:41.601
(gasps)

17:43.805 --> 17:45.304
Hi, sir. My name is Nancy.

17:45.306 --> 17:47.065
I'm a paramedic,
and I'm here to help you.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.215
What happened?

17:48.217 --> 17:49.233
Your heart stopped beating,

17:49.235 --> 17:51.294
but we got it restarted again.

17:51.296 --> 17:52.962
No, what happened to Valerie?

17:52.964 --> 17:53.979
I'm right here, Lance.

17:53.981 --> 17:55.147
LANCE:
You might want to eat something.

17:55.149 --> 17:56.890
How about some
mushroom and fennel?

17:56.892 --> 17:59.410
Oh. Oh...

18:00.488 --> 18:01.487
You should be just fine.

18:01.806 --> 18:03.581
They're gonna run some tests
at the hospital

18:03.583 --> 18:04.473
just to make sure.

18:04.567 --> 18:06.751
Wait!
Hang on just a second!

18:08.571 --> 18:09.629
(pants)

18:15.320 --> 18:17.762
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

18:17.764 --> 18:20.389
for all of the jolts I gave you.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.007
It's okay.

18:22.009 --> 18:24.310
I think a jolt
is just what I needed.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.312
Me, too.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.090
Aw.

18:30.092 --> 18:31.758
Speaking of jolts.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.611
Thank you, brave knight.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.264
From now on,
I'll only be saying that
to you in person.

18:37.266 --> 18:39.933
Uh, I appreciate that,
but I won't be delivering pizzas

18:39.935 --> 18:41.953
to your house anymore
or-or anyone else.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.145
I quit.

18:44.515 --> 18:47.667
Well, then we should probably
get dinner out sometime.

18:48.686 --> 18:49.669
I'd like that.

18:52.206 --> 18:55.383
♪

19:03.292 --> 19:05.125
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:05.127 --> 19:06.960
Well, he needed a sitter.

19:06.962 --> 19:08.128
Well. Okay.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.055
Alright. And don't say "hell."
Come on.

19:10.057 --> 19:11.274
He'll be out in a second.

19:16.047 --> 19:18.030
So have you seen Melody?

19:18.733 --> 19:19.882
I have seen her.

19:19.884 --> 19:21.050
Mm-hmm.

19:21.052 --> 19:22.160
And she seemed okay, T.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.370
-Sweet as pie.
-Mm-hmm.

19:28.726 --> 19:30.501
Oh, my goodness.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.152
Thank you.

19:32.154 --> 19:34.755
Hey, Mel, come on out here.
We're leaving soon.

19:36.158 --> 19:39.585
Wow! Miss Tommy,
you look like a movie star.

19:39.587 --> 19:40.903
Thank you.

19:40.905 --> 19:42.421
I mean it.

19:42.423 --> 19:44.515
-Okay, so dinner's on low heat.
-GRACE: Mm-hmm.

19:44.517 --> 19:48.244
She usually eats around 7:00
and bedtime's at 9:30.

19:48.246 --> 19:50.095
Let me show you
where the Crockpot is.

19:50.097 --> 19:51.747
And we really
appreciate this, Grace.

19:51.749 --> 19:52.765
Oh, you're so welcome.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.767
You'll be repaying
the favor very soon.

19:54.769 --> 19:56.402
-No doubt.
-(laughter)

19:59.924 --> 20:03.016
I think that dress
was a bad idea.

20:03.018 --> 20:04.851
You just said
I looked like a movie star.

20:04.853 --> 20:06.186
You do.

20:06.188 --> 20:07.613
But that's really not
how you should dress

20:07.615 --> 20:09.356
when you're about
to break a man's heart.

20:09.358 --> 20:10.449
Melody...

20:10.451 --> 20:12.192
I'm not going out
with your dad tonight

20:12.194 --> 20:14.027
to break up with him.

20:14.029 --> 20:16.363
I thought we had
an understanding.

20:16.365 --> 20:19.458
Honey, when we said
it was important to us

20:19.460 --> 20:22.945
that you girls be okay
with this, we meant it.

20:22.947 --> 20:24.129
Which is why tonight at dinner,

20:24.131 --> 20:25.614
I'm gonna have
a frank conversation

20:25.616 --> 20:28.226
with your dad about
your complicated feelings.

20:28.228 --> 20:32.045
Okay. Well, don't say
I didn't warn you.

20:32.047 --> 20:33.231
TREVOR:
My number is right there.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.473
And here's the number
of the restaurant

20:34.475 --> 20:36.459
-in case you can't reach me.
-GRACE: Mm-hm.

20:36.461 --> 20:39.144
And, uh, I mean,
if anything should--

20:39.146 --> 20:40.629
GRACE:
It's okay, pastor, don't worry.

20:40.631 --> 20:43.148
I know who to call
in case of emergency.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.558
TREVOR:
Of course you do.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.893
Okay. Uh, we should be
home by 11:00.

20:46.895 --> 20:47.894
I love you, Mel.

20:47.896 --> 20:48.704
You, too.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.208
You guys have fun.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.317
-PAUL: Alright, so...
-(Asha and Paul laugh)

21:01.319 --> 21:04.762
So this kid has this toy truck,
like, stuck up his nose.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.506
-I mean, his sinus
is bulging up in there.
-ASHA FULTON: No.

21:07.508 --> 21:09.508
So I tell him
it's not gonna hurt, right?

21:09.510 --> 21:11.160
-Just a little white lie.
-Yeah, for the greater good.

21:11.162 --> 21:12.177
-Thank you.
-ASHA: Yeah.

21:12.179 --> 21:13.679
Okay, so we get it out,

21:13.681 --> 21:17.016
and when I tell you,
this little G exploded,
I mean, boom.

21:17.018 --> 21:18.776
-"You lied!"
-Oh, no.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.444
"You lied! It hurt, oh!"

21:20.446 --> 21:22.780
I mean, tears, snot.
I mean, the whole nine.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.431
I felt like such a monster.

21:24.433 --> 21:28.344
Oh, no. You could
never be a monster.

21:28.346 --> 21:31.122
So you will never believe
what I found

21:31.124 --> 21:33.541
in a box in my closet.

21:35.202 --> 21:36.777
PAUL:
Oh, is that the, uh--

21:36.779 --> 21:38.462
ASHA:
Sixth grade yearbook.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.132
Check it out.

21:41.134 --> 21:45.261
They had a full spread
on the basketball team.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.531
Aw! Look at us.

21:48.533 --> 21:49.557
So adorable.

21:51.536 --> 21:53.394
Paul, you okay?

21:53.813 --> 21:55.054
Huh?

21:55.056 --> 21:56.463
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
No, this is great.

21:56.465 --> 21:59.966
L-Look, isn't that, uh,
Carly Sonterras right there?

21:59.968 --> 22:01.134
Oh, my God, yes!

22:01.136 --> 22:02.820
With the rec specs.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.713
I forgot all about her.

22:04.715 --> 22:05.972
(Asha laughs)

22:05.974 --> 22:07.366
Ah, it's a trip.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.147
(Trevor chuckles)

22:14.149 --> 22:15.391
I'll be honest.

22:15.484 --> 22:19.228
For a while there,
I was really questioning God.

22:19.230 --> 22:21.230
Going through
a divorce as a pastor

22:21.232 --> 22:23.065
with the whole
congregation watching.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.658
It was rough.

22:24.660 --> 22:26.159
I, I can't even imagine.

22:26.161 --> 22:27.570
But there's a reason Isaiah says

22:27.572 --> 22:31.256
that God's ways
are higher than our ways.

22:31.258 --> 22:33.258
And seeing the three girls
together like that,

22:33.260 --> 22:36.020
I mean, that was--
it was amazing, Tommy.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.765
I haven't heard Melody
laugh like that since she was--

22:39.767 --> 22:41.058
since she was seven years old.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.435
I think what I'm trying
to say, Tommy,

22:43.437 --> 22:46.939
is that I am so glad
that He led us to you.

22:46.941 --> 22:47.990
I feel the same way.

22:49.443 --> 22:51.276
But there's something
I need to tell you.

22:51.278 --> 22:52.761
-(cell phone ringing)
-Um...

22:52.763 --> 22:53.996
TREVOR: Oh.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.665
Hey, Grace, what's going on?

22:57.935 --> 22:59.418
Oh, we'll be right there.

23:03.274 --> 23:04.106
Hello?

23:04.108 --> 23:05.508
GRACE:
Yeah, we're in here.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.367
Dad.

23:07.369 --> 23:09.278
Hey, sweetie.
I'm right here.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.112
GRACE: I, uh...

23:10.223 --> 23:11.371
I really don't know
what happened.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.224
We were about to sit down,
start dinner.

23:13.226 --> 23:16.894
She started looking clammy,
and she just, she took a turn.

23:16.896 --> 23:17.970
TREVOR:
How do you feel, sweetie?

23:17.972 --> 23:20.139
It hurts.

23:20.141 --> 23:21.381
TREVOR:
Aw, honey, I'm so sorry.

23:21.401 --> 23:24.643
Tommy, I am so sorry
to interrupt your dinner.

23:24.645 --> 23:26.629
I didn't know what else to do.
She's just been a mess.

23:26.631 --> 23:28.814
TOMMY:
Hmm. Did you
take her temperature?

23:28.816 --> 23:31.150
Yeah, I did.
It was normal, but--

23:31.152 --> 23:32.893
TREVOR:
Oh, my poor baby girl.

23:32.895 --> 23:33.894
Ow!

23:33.896 --> 23:35.154
Hold my purse.

23:35.156 --> 23:36.414
-Hey, Trevor.
-Yeah?

23:36.416 --> 23:37.656
Would you let me
take a look at her?

23:37.658 --> 23:39.324
TREVOR:
Oh, would you, Tommy?
Thank you.

23:39.326 --> 23:41.085
Of course.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.978
Hey, sweetie.

23:42.980 --> 23:44.313
How you feeling?

23:44.315 --> 23:45.164
-Bad.
-Okay.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.833
Um, will you sit up for me?

23:47.835 --> 23:49.343
Go, "Aah."

23:49.670 --> 23:51.077
Aah.

23:51.079 --> 23:54.006
Alright, I'm gonna palpate
your stomach, alright?

23:54.008 --> 23:55.766
Just right here.
Lay back for me.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.768
There you go.
Does that hurt?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.728
-A little.
-Little?

24:00.514 --> 24:01.272
Hmm.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.923
Should we call an ambulance?

24:02.925 --> 24:04.308
No. No, no, no.
That won't be necessary.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.760
But I do have some good news
and some bad news.

24:06.762 --> 24:07.945
What is it?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.930
Well, I believe she has

24:09.932 --> 24:13.692
rapid-onset
juvenile gastrosintesis.

24:13.694 --> 24:16.028
-Is that the bad news?
-No, that's the good news.

24:16.030 --> 24:17.604
It's completely treatable.

24:17.606 --> 24:19.373
What's the bad news?

24:20.534 --> 24:22.201
The treatment.

24:22.203 --> 24:24.295
Yeah. I need you to mix up
some things for me.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.964
Okay?
Uh, milk and pickle juice,

24:26.966 --> 24:30.359
minced garlic
and, um, um, horseradish.

24:30.361 --> 24:32.452
-Okay? Okay.
-Okay.

24:32.454 --> 24:36.198
Well, Tommy, are you sure
that that's necessary?

24:36.200 --> 24:37.791
Oh, absolutely.

24:37.793 --> 24:38.976
Mm-hmm. Oh!

24:38.978 --> 24:40.552
(laughs) That's right.
Almost forgot.

24:40.554 --> 24:47.059
Um, raw egg and soy sauce
and Tabasco.

24:47.061 --> 24:50.136
Mm-hmm. Gracie, will you
help Trevor out with that?

24:50.138 --> 24:52.323
-Uh, yeah.
-Thank you.

24:55.553 --> 24:57.219
You're a lunatic.

24:57.221 --> 24:59.497
Now, you can drop this act,

24:59.499 --> 25:02.741
or you're about to have
the worst milkshake
of your life.

25:02.743 --> 25:05.394
-How much pickle juice?
-Can't have too much!

25:05.396 --> 25:07.988
And, uh, you're sure
this works, Tommy?

25:07.990 --> 25:10.341
Oh, yes.
It's my<i> abuelita's</i> recipe.

25:10.343 --> 25:12.993
Uh-huh, yeah, the, the milk
coats the stomach

25:12.995 --> 25:14.586
and the-the pickle juice

25:14.588 --> 25:16.905
just pumps her
full of electrolytes.

25:16.907 --> 25:18.907
What about the, uh, Tabasco?

25:18.909 --> 25:20.559
Immunity booster.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.747
Last chance.

25:24.749 --> 25:26.373
(footsteps approaching)

25:26.375 --> 25:27.858
TREVOR:
Okay. (sighs)

25:27.860 --> 25:29.026
Here you go, sweetie.

25:29.845 --> 25:31.028
Drink up.

25:34.349 --> 25:36.617
Is there something
you'd like to say, Melody?

25:41.599 --> 25:42.414
Thank you.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.299
Oh, wow.

25:56.130 --> 25:58.597
So brave. Right?

26:08.568 --> 26:10.309
Hey, Paul!

26:10.311 --> 26:12.886
Ooh, looks like
somebody was up late.

26:12.888 --> 26:15.739
Yeah, I didn't really get
too much sleep last night, man.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.557
Ooh, you bad boy.

26:17.559 --> 26:18.742
TK: Damn!

26:18.744 --> 26:20.244
Things with Asha went that well?

26:20.246 --> 26:23.063
-(Mateo laughs)
-Not really, no.

26:23.065 --> 26:24.915
I don't think we'll be
seeing each other again.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.825
Wait, what?
What about the sparks?

26:26.827 --> 26:27.976
Well, that's the thing
about sparks, man,

26:27.995 --> 26:29.661
they don't really last
too long, do they?

26:29.663 --> 26:32.756
Well, what the hell happened?
This was supposed to be destiny.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.316
Yeah, well, destiny
is a bunch of bull, okay?

26:34.318 --> 26:36.168
And this is personal,
so I'd appreciate it

26:36.170 --> 26:37.836
if you guys
will stop riding me about it!

26:37.838 --> 26:41.265
Hey. I'm sorry, man.

26:42.509 --> 26:43.992
OWEN: Paul?

26:43.994 --> 26:45.561
Can I see you in my office?

26:52.837 --> 26:55.762
Look, Cap, you don't
have to say anything, okay?

26:55.764 --> 26:57.114
I'll go apologize to 'em.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.340
Oh, that would be
a good idea.

26:58.342 --> 26:59.933
But I didn't call you in
for a reprimand.

26:59.935 --> 27:02.027
Just to, just to talk.

27:02.029 --> 27:03.195
Look, I appreciate it,

27:03.197 --> 27:04.363
but you're already
my captain, okay?

27:04.365 --> 27:05.864
I don't need you to be
my therapist, too.

27:05.866 --> 27:07.458
The tension
you carry around in here,

27:07.460 --> 27:09.960
you take out there
in the field with your team.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.962
Alright? So, have a seat.

27:16.694 --> 27:17.784
What's going on?

27:18.379 --> 27:21.221
(sighs deeply)
Okay, fine.

27:22.049 --> 27:23.882
It's about Asha.

27:23.884 --> 27:25.033
The woman from HR?

27:25.035 --> 27:26.201
I thought you guys
were hitting it off.

27:26.203 --> 27:28.479
Yeah, we were.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.296
She's not who you
thought she was?

27:30.298 --> 27:31.965
No, she's exactly
who I thought she was.

27:31.967 --> 27:33.800
I mean, she's cool as hell.

27:33.802 --> 27:34.877
She's beautiful, funny,

27:34.879 --> 27:35.894
and she knows about me

27:35.896 --> 27:37.562
and she's clearly
still interested.

27:37.564 --> 27:39.064
You know,
I thought it's all teed up.

27:39.066 --> 27:40.324
There's not gonna
be any surprises.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.992
No, no awkward conversations,

27:41.994 --> 27:43.994
because she already
knows everything.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.329
So what's the problem?

27:46.832 --> 27:48.907
She already knows everything.

27:48.909 --> 27:51.001
Um, I'm not sure I understand.

27:51.745 --> 27:52.836
(sighs)

27:52.838 --> 27:55.155
It's, like,
throughout the whole dinner,

27:55.157 --> 27:57.065
all she wanted to do
was play remember when,

27:57.067 --> 27:58.750
like, when we did
<i> Arsenic and Old Lace</i>

27:58.752 --> 28:00.085
for the school play

28:00.179 --> 28:02.738
or when we won
the city championships
in basketball.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.423
And those are
unhappy memories for you?

28:04.425 --> 28:05.349
No, they were.

28:05.518 --> 28:07.667
I mean, the school play
was never my jam,

28:07.669 --> 28:10.062
but... I loved to hoop.

28:10.764 --> 28:12.022
You played basketball?

28:12.024 --> 28:13.840
Because I've never heard you

28:13.842 --> 28:15.192
talk about it or watch a game.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.694
Why, why'd you give it up?

28:20.107 --> 28:21.773
(sighs deeply) Uh...

28:21.775 --> 28:23.942
I-I guess before I transitioned,

28:23.944 --> 28:26.370
there were these things, like...

28:27.355 --> 28:30.265
these parts of myself that...

28:30.267 --> 28:32.100
were so tied
to who everybody
thought I should be

28:32.102 --> 28:34.027
that I had to, like,
close the door on them

28:34.029 --> 28:36.296
in order to really be who I am.

28:38.108 --> 28:40.467
And she's seen
behind all those doors.

28:42.463 --> 28:45.264
And there are some of 'em
you still don't wanna open up.

28:48.210 --> 28:50.686
Yeah, I guess you can call it
a survival mechanism.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.379
But, hey, Cap,
I really appreciate you

28:53.624 --> 28:55.624
letting me come in here
and talk to you,
um, and clear my head.

28:55.626 --> 28:57.125
I feel like I'm ready
to go back to work.

28:57.127 --> 28:59.052
-Is it cool if I go?
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah, sure.

28:59.054 --> 29:00.362
Alright, cool, thank you.

29:06.136 --> 29:08.078
If, uh, if you're making
another one of your, uh,

29:08.080 --> 29:09.395
nasty pickle milkshakes,

29:09.397 --> 29:10.322
I think I'll pass.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.324
Aah. Gracie told you
about that, huh?

29:12.326 --> 29:14.142
Oh, yeah.
Grace told me about

29:14.144 --> 29:17.329
how you, uh, reduced
some little girl to tears.

29:17.998 --> 29:20.999
One tear, one single tear.

29:21.001 --> 29:23.927
And, you know,
and it was pretty great.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.320
Wow.

29:25.322 --> 29:27.097
What?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.766
I don't know, I don't know
if I've ever seen

29:28.768 --> 29:30.158
this side of you before.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.919
It's, uh... it's kinda dark.

29:32.921 --> 29:35.330
I was just
following your advice.

29:35.332 --> 29:37.590
Oh, my advice?
What-what was my advice?

29:37.592 --> 29:40.110
Well, you're the one
that said she had
a heart of darkness.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.021
I don't recall telling you
to go full Tommy dearest

29:43.023 --> 29:44.264
on some innocent child.

29:44.266 --> 29:47.192
Oh, first of all,
not innocent, okay?

29:47.194 --> 29:49.528
And secondly, she, well...

29:49.530 --> 29:50.603
She started it.

29:50.605 --> 29:51.771
Mm-hmm.

29:51.865 --> 29:53.515
You know, if you're gonna
come for the queen,

29:53.517 --> 29:54.291
you best come correct.

29:54.442 --> 29:55.867
Yes, yes.
Yes, Your Highness.

29:55.869 --> 29:58.778
-(Tommy chuckles)
-Uh...

29:58.780 --> 30:00.872
looks like you got company.

30:00.874 --> 30:02.541
TOMMY: Melody?

30:02.543 --> 30:04.134
Um... (nervous laugh)

30:04.136 --> 30:05.469
What are you doing here?

30:05.471 --> 30:07.954
Miss Tommy.
Can I speak with you?

30:07.956 --> 30:09.807
Yeah.
Um, is your dad here?

30:09.809 --> 30:12.643
No. This is between us.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.537
Okay.

30:15.539 --> 30:16.721
Uh...

30:16.723 --> 30:18.315
Come with me.

30:20.561 --> 30:21.527
(Judd chuckles)

30:23.730 --> 30:25.030
(Tommy sighs deeply)

30:26.992 --> 30:30.402
Um, can I get you
something to drink?

30:30.404 --> 30:32.663
I think I'll pass
on another drink from you.

30:32.665 --> 30:33.722
Oh.

30:33.724 --> 30:34.981
Right. Uh...

30:34.983 --> 30:36.725
So...

30:36.727 --> 30:38.985
"Juvenile gastrosintesis."

30:38.987 --> 30:40.562
I looked it up.

30:40.564 --> 30:42.080
It doesn't exist.

30:42.082 --> 30:43.748
No. No, it doesn't.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.175
And not my finest hour.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.568
It was well played.

30:46.570 --> 30:47.493
If I'm being honest,

30:47.680 --> 30:50.180
I had no idea
what I was going up against.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.424
Believe me, kid,
neither did I.

30:52.426 --> 30:56.261
Listen...
Melody, this thing
between us has...

30:56.263 --> 30:59.264
gone far enough,
don't you think?

30:59.266 --> 31:02.209
I mean,
let's just call a truce.

31:02.211 --> 31:05.195
But we're just
getting to the fun part.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.513
What are you talking about?

31:07.515 --> 31:09.107
Uncle Julius.

31:09.109 --> 31:11.093
I saw his photos online.

31:11.095 --> 31:12.928
I can't blame you.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.162
He's hot.

31:14.948 --> 31:16.373
What are you suggesting?

31:16.375 --> 31:19.935
You know, Evie and Izzy
have been so great to me.

31:19.937 --> 31:23.029
Showing me around school,
hanging out.

31:23.031 --> 31:25.031
We do a lot of talking
on the playground.

31:25.033 --> 31:26.458
Why am I picturing
a prison yard?

31:26.460 --> 31:28.793
And they told me
all about how they saw

31:28.795 --> 31:30.387
their mom and Uncle Julius

31:30.389 --> 31:33.448
doing something a mom
and her brother should never do.

31:33.450 --> 31:37.394
Okay, you know what?
First of all, not my brother.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.878
Brother-in-law.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.064
And we were very careful not--

31:46.130 --> 31:47.887
They never told you
any of that, did they?

31:47.889 --> 31:50.699
No. But you just did.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.304
TOMMY (over phone):
<i> Brother-in-law.</i>

31:56.306 --> 31:58.064
<i> And we were</i>
<i> very careful not--</i>

31:58.066 --> 31:59.374
(phone dings)

31:59.993 --> 32:01.826
Bad Seed.

32:01.828 --> 32:03.236
I don't know what that means,

32:03.238 --> 32:06.089
but this is your last chance
to break up with my dad

32:06.091 --> 32:07.332
or else I'll tell him all about

32:07.334 --> 32:09.468
what you did
with your own brother.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.555
In-law.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.558
Brother-in-law!

32:23.333 --> 32:26.092
-GRACE: For you.
-Thank you, Gracie,

32:26.094 --> 32:28.428
for making time
in the middle of your shift.

32:28.430 --> 32:29.929
Why do I feel like
my coffee break

32:29.931 --> 32:32.524
is going to be
the biggest emergency
I'll face all day?

32:32.526 --> 32:35.026
Well, I didn't think
it was possible,

32:35.028 --> 32:37.788
but that kid
has topped herself.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.790
She's blackmailing me.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.792
-She's blackmailing you?
-Mm-hmm.

32:41.794 --> 32:45.036
Tommy, what could she
possibly blackmail you about?

32:45.038 --> 32:46.371
Uncle Julius.

32:46.373 --> 32:48.748
Yeah, she's threatening
to tell her dad

32:48.750 --> 32:50.192
that I had a fling

32:50.194 --> 32:53.619
with my deceased husband's
baby brother.

32:53.621 --> 32:54.713
GRACE: What?

32:54.715 --> 32:56.640
Okay, well, maybe that child

32:56.642 --> 32:57.641
is a little evil, then,

32:57.810 --> 33:01.019
because how can she
make up something so...

33:03.890 --> 33:05.173
-Tommy?
-TOMMY: Mm-hmm.

33:05.175 --> 33:06.525
GRACE: Oh, oh, oh.

33:07.135 --> 33:08.527
You and Julius?

33:09.471 --> 33:10.320
Yes.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.050
-So...
-What?

33:15.052 --> 33:16.994
How was it, Tommy?

33:16.996 --> 33:20.813
It was kinda
mind-blowing, actually.

33:20.815 --> 33:22.833
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm. I bet it was.

33:22.835 --> 33:26.152
Uh, okay, listen, we need
to get back on topic here, okay?

33:26.154 --> 33:27.395
-Just focus. Alright.
-Okay.

33:27.397 --> 33:29.840
'Cause I've been
gaming out some scenarios

33:29.842 --> 33:31.675
to help bring this
Melody situation

33:31.677 --> 33:32.751
to a conclusion.

33:32.753 --> 33:34.569
Okay. Well, let's
hear 'em then.

33:34.571 --> 33:37.572
Alright, so no
bad ideas, right?

33:37.574 --> 33:39.090
Okay. Yeah, sure.

33:39.092 --> 33:41.760
Okay. So I eavesdropped
on Iz and Evie last night

33:41.762 --> 33:45.022
and they were talking
about how Melody
has a secret TikTok

33:45.024 --> 33:48.358
where she uses bad words
and talks about boys,

33:48.360 --> 33:51.253
and it's like all this
really good, useful dirt, right?

33:51.255 --> 33:53.864
So I thought
that I would blackmail her

33:53.866 --> 33:56.408
to stop blackmailing me.

33:58.019 --> 34:00.595
So-- So that one's
a bad idea.

34:00.597 --> 34:02.039
No. No bad ideas.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.281
GRACE:
It is, Tommy,

34:03.283 --> 34:04.599
because if I'm being
honest with you,

34:04.601 --> 34:07.118
you really don't have
to game anything out

34:07.120 --> 34:09.862
because you really
only have one option.

34:09.864 --> 34:12.198
No. Gracie,
don't say the truth.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.534
It's the truth.
You owe it to Trevor.

34:14.536 --> 34:15.777
Gracie.

34:15.779 --> 34:17.888
No. If I snitch on her now,

34:17.890 --> 34:19.114
she'll never forgive me.

34:19.116 --> 34:20.282
If you don't tell Trevor,

34:20.300 --> 34:22.225
this whole battle royale
between you and Melody

34:22.227 --> 34:24.377
is going to blow up
in both of your faces.

34:24.379 --> 34:26.379
And it's going to
turn out worse for one

34:26.381 --> 34:28.123
than it's going to
for the other.

34:28.125 --> 34:29.357
Which one?

34:30.569 --> 34:32.444
The one that's not 12.

34:33.888 --> 34:34.738
(knock on door)

34:35.465 --> 34:37.482
Tommy, this is a nice surprise.

34:37.484 --> 34:40.059
Trevor, um, I'm sorry
to stop in like this,

34:40.061 --> 34:42.137
but, uh, am I
interrupting something?

34:42.139 --> 34:43.246
No, no, no,
I was just, uh, going over

34:43.248 --> 34:44.823
my notes for tomorrow's sermon.

34:44.825 --> 34:45.990
Oh.

34:45.992 --> 34:49.327
The Power of Forgiveness
in Second Timothy.

34:49.329 --> 34:51.162
Oh, we can all use some of that.

34:51.164 --> 34:52.339
(Trevor chuckles)

34:52.833 --> 34:54.007
TOMMY: Uh...

34:55.094 --> 34:58.762
So, um, is-is Melody around?

34:58.764 --> 35:01.247
Uh, she's sleeping in,
I think.

35:01.249 --> 35:02.516
Oh.

35:04.085 --> 35:06.828
Tommy, what's going on?
Is something wrong?

35:06.830 --> 35:08.997
Uh, yes. Uh... yes, Trevor.

35:08.999 --> 35:12.334
Something is--
Something's very wrong.

35:12.336 --> 35:15.186
Look, I-I just think
that we jumped in too fast.

35:15.188 --> 35:18.340
Formalizing our-our
relationship with the girls.

35:18.342 --> 35:22.285
Oh, no. Are Evie and Izzy
having problems?

35:22.287 --> 35:23.269
No.

35:23.271 --> 35:26.331
Uh, but I-I think I am.

35:27.367 --> 35:28.291
Oh.

35:29.686 --> 35:30.544
(Trevor sighs)

35:31.521 --> 35:32.778
How do you mean?

35:32.780 --> 35:35.707
I mean that, uh... (sighs)

35:35.709 --> 35:39.118
I haven't been behaving
like the person I wanna be.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.286
Tommy, what are you
talking about?

35:40.305 --> 35:42.881
You're one of the most
kind and honest people

35:42.883 --> 35:43.974
that I've ever met.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.792
And I have not been as honest

35:46.794 --> 35:49.312
or kind as you might think.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.039
Also, um...

35:51.041 --> 35:52.649
(scoffs) I...

35:52.651 --> 35:55.543
I slept with my deceased
husband's brother last year,

35:55.545 --> 35:58.563
and I'm not the least bit
ashamed about it.

35:58.565 --> 36:00.382
Okay. (chuckles)

36:00.384 --> 36:03.051
Well, that last part
is between you and--

36:03.053 --> 36:04.828
-God.
-Your brother-in-law.

36:04.830 --> 36:05.996
Right.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.664
And it's in the past.

36:08.742 --> 36:10.983
It is in the past, right?

36:10.985 --> 36:12.485
Yes. Yes.

36:12.487 --> 36:16.756
Okay, so then what is
really going on here, Tommy?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.845
Did Melody say
something to you?

36:21.847 --> 36:24.014
This is not about her.

36:24.016 --> 36:27.184
This is about me
and I-I just--

36:27.186 --> 36:30.169
I think it's best if we...

36:30.171 --> 36:31.579
break up now...

36:32.098 --> 36:34.232
before somebody gets hurt.

36:35.602 --> 36:36.651
Hmm.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.197
Well, it's too late
for that, Tommy.

36:41.182 --> 36:43.325
I'm so sorry, Trevor.

36:44.594 --> 36:45.493
MELODY: Daddy!

36:46.446 --> 36:48.371
TREVOR:
Out here, sweetie.

36:49.115 --> 36:50.856
I-I don't feel too good.

36:50.858 --> 36:51.783
(sighs)

36:51.785 --> 36:53.710
You can stop now, Melody.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.453
Really. You won.

36:55.455 --> 36:56.287
We just broke up.

36:56.289 --> 36:58.197
No, it really hurts this time.

36:58.199 --> 36:59.457
What do you mean "you won"?

36:59.459 --> 37:01.051
And what do you mean
"this time"?

37:01.053 --> 37:02.126
(winces sharply)

37:02.128 --> 37:03.127
Oh, alright. Come here.

37:03.129 --> 37:04.295
Here, sit down.

37:04.297 --> 37:07.206
Let me take
a look at you, alright?

37:07.208 --> 37:09.059
-Can you tell me where it hurts?
-My stomach.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.135
Alright, is it,
is it a stabbing pain

37:11.137 --> 37:12.896
or is it more like pressure?

37:12.898 --> 37:14.564
It just keeps squeezing.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.975
Alright, um, have you been
able to go to the bathroom

37:16.977 --> 37:17.976
these last couple of days?

37:17.978 --> 37:18.977
-Yes.
-TOMMY: Yeah?

37:18.979 --> 37:20.128
And does it hurt more

37:20.130 --> 37:21.796
on one side than the other?

37:21.798 --> 37:23.240
No. All over.

37:23.242 --> 37:28.303
Okay. Is it constant
or does it come in waves?

37:28.305 --> 37:29.079
Waves.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.805
TREVOR:
Is everything okay?

37:30.807 --> 37:32.415
Yeah. Yeah, she's just fine.

37:32.417 --> 37:35.326
No. I'm not faking it
this time. I swear.

37:35.328 --> 37:36.736
I know you're not, honey.

37:36.738 --> 37:37.996
Okay, so what's going on?

37:37.998 --> 37:39.756
Well, Melody and I just, um--

37:39.758 --> 37:43.409
We need to have a moment alone.

37:43.411 --> 37:45.095
Could you show me to your room?

37:45.097 --> 37:47.430
-(winces)
-Okay.

37:49.659 --> 37:50.433
(mouths)

37:57.943 --> 37:59.834
TOMMY:
Everything okay in there?

37:59.836 --> 38:00.685
MELODY: Yeah.

38:00.687 --> 38:02.279
Almost done.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.741
(door opens)

38:09.121 --> 38:11.604
Feels like I'm wearing a diaper.

38:11.606 --> 38:14.349
I can't believe this is
gonna be the rest of my life.

38:14.351 --> 38:15.683
Well, not your whole life.

38:15.685 --> 38:17.201
But I'm not gonna lie,

38:17.203 --> 38:19.170
it's no walk in the park.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.873
Does it always
hurt this much?

38:21.875 --> 38:25.719
Heating pads help,
and, uh, ibuprofen.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.640
(groans, sniffles)

38:31.718 --> 38:33.560
(Melody sobbing)

38:34.813 --> 38:37.129
I really wish my mom were here.

38:37.131 --> 38:38.440
I know, honey.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.066
I know.

38:40.894 --> 38:42.301
Hey, you know, you're gonna

38:42.303 --> 38:44.562
be able to speak
to her real soon

38:44.564 --> 38:47.198
and she's gonna
have great advice.

38:48.401 --> 38:51.235
You know, the thing
about your period is,

38:51.237 --> 38:52.829
it's really just about
figuring out

38:52.831 --> 38:54.414
what works best for you.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.541
Okay.

38:57.911 --> 38:59.744
And I...

38:59.746 --> 39:02.154
I know I'm probably
the last person on your list,

39:02.156 --> 39:04.424
but you can always talk to me.

39:05.326 --> 39:06.384
Thank you.

39:07.328 --> 39:08.386
And...

39:09.239 --> 39:12.832
I'm sorry for everything.

39:12.834 --> 39:17.729
You're just the first person
my dad has dated since my mom.

39:19.583 --> 39:21.441
And I was mad...

39:22.361 --> 39:23.401
at him.

39:23.845 --> 39:25.195
And you.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.772
Oh, I know.

39:27.774 --> 39:30.108
Believe me, I've been there.

39:30.110 --> 39:32.685
Wait, your parents
were divorced, too?

39:32.687 --> 39:34.278
Mm-hmm.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.207
And I may or may not
have slashed the tires

39:37.209 --> 39:40.952
on my mom's
first boyfriend's Camaro.

39:40.954 --> 39:42.937
I knew I shouldn't
have messed with you.

39:42.939 --> 39:45.048
(Tommy chuckles)

39:45.050 --> 39:47.425
So you broke up
with my dad, huh?

39:47.961 --> 39:49.260
I did.

39:49.963 --> 39:52.222
Is there any way

39:52.224 --> 39:55.967
that maybe you'd be
willing to talk to him?

39:55.969 --> 39:58.210
You can tell him
it was all my fault,

39:58.212 --> 40:00.972
but just maybe un-dump him.

40:00.974 --> 40:02.624
(Tommy inhales)

40:02.626 --> 40:05.960
Well, I might
be willing to talk to him,

40:05.962 --> 40:08.154
but, you know,
I'm not gonna do it alone.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.449
-(Melody groans)
-Come on.

40:11.968 --> 40:13.451
Let's go.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.288
(phone buzzes)

40:25.665 --> 40:27.072
What is this supposed to be?

40:27.074 --> 40:28.316
A basketball.

40:28.318 --> 40:31.094
I thought it might help
if you picked one up.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.763
Well, look, I appreciate
what you're trying
to do here, Cap,

40:33.765 --> 40:34.931
but I don't need
exposure therapy.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.492
I'm not afraid of basketballs.

40:37.494 --> 40:40.995
So there was about
a four-year period

40:40.997 --> 40:42.497
when TK was little
where I didn't go

40:42.499 --> 40:45.016
to a single one of his
winter concerts.

40:45.018 --> 40:46.443
Well, I can see why
you didn't wanna see

40:46.445 --> 40:48.928
a bunch of four-year-olds
singing<i> We Three Kings.</i>

40:48.930 --> 40:51.430
Yeah, well, I did wanna go.

40:51.432 --> 40:55.026
That's the thing.
More than... than anything.

40:55.028 --> 40:56.235
Well, why didn't you?

40:56.955 --> 40:59.197
Because it was too painful.

40:59.199 --> 41:00.364
I didn't wanna look at him

41:00.366 --> 41:02.366
sitting next to
some of his friends

41:02.368 --> 41:04.794
whose dads hadn't
made it out of 9/11.

41:04.796 --> 41:08.356
And so about the fourth year,
Gwyn just shows up at my house.

41:08.358 --> 41:10.467
We'd long since been divorced.

41:10.469 --> 41:12.860
And just said,
"Owen, you're going,

41:12.862 --> 41:14.954
"whether you want to or not.

41:14.956 --> 41:18.266
You survived, but you're still
allowed to enjoy your life."

41:23.464 --> 41:25.056
So is this your way
of telling me

41:25.058 --> 41:27.358
that it's time for me
to open the door?

41:28.878 --> 41:30.653
And I wanna show you something.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.307
-(ball bouncing)
-PAUL: Oh, man.

41:35.309 --> 41:36.567
Now, when did you
put this up?

41:36.569 --> 41:39.053
I had the probie go
and pick it up on his shift.

41:39.055 --> 41:40.663
You sneaky bastard.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.425
Oh! I'd say you're
about to enjoy yourself,

41:44.427 --> 41:46.728
-but I know you're not.
-Oh yeah, why is that?

41:46.730 --> 41:49.321
-'Cause I'm about
to take you to the hole.
-Oh!

41:49.323 --> 41:51.566
OWEN: Alright, alright!
Hey, you're not gonna make that.

41:51.568 --> 41:53.343
Since when are we
a basketball house?

41:53.345 --> 41:55.570
-I guess since now.
-PAUL: Now, you done did it.

41:55.572 --> 41:57.162
You just brought Chicago's
second greatest shooting guard

41:57.164 --> 41:58.330
out of retirement.

41:58.332 --> 41:59.907
You comparing yourself
to Michael Jordan?

41:59.909 --> 42:01.226
I said second.

42:02.428 --> 42:04.262
-OWEN: Oh, there you go.
-Damn. Paul can ball.

42:04.264 --> 42:06.430
Hey. Yo! Come on,
a little three-on-three.

42:06.432 --> 42:07.932
I could play
a little round ball.

42:07.934 --> 42:09.526
Dad, I'm on your team.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.027
TOMMY: Thank you.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.196
Hmm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

42:13.198 --> 42:16.515
Alright. Alright.
Now, that is heresy.

42:16.517 --> 42:18.926
Who puts mango
on a cookies-and-cream base?

42:18.928 --> 42:22.187

I told you we were gonna
have fun together.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.561
Yeah, I'm starting to think

you were right
