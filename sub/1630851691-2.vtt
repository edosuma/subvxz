There's still
your sentencing.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.564
<i> And you might go back in,</i>

02:49.403 --> 02:51.336
<i> I think there's</i>
<i> a good chance,</i>

02:51.338 --> 02:54.539
<i> As long as it's reflected</i>
<i> in the pre-sentence report.</i>

02:54.542 --> 02:58.677
But everything I've gone
through has landed me in prison.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.547
Once I get that
pre-sentence report,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.548
I will talk to the crown.

on used to be africville.

03:39.519 --> 03:40.585
Okay.

03:40.621 --> 03:44.056
Right, so, that's what the
field trip's all about.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.391
It's where my
client grew up.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.526
It's all gone now,
except for this church.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.129
It's not the
original of course.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.666
That was torn down with
the rest of her community.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.468
Steve:
<i> Jojo carvery killed</i>
<i> a man, marcie.</i>

03:56.537 --> 03:57.802
I'm sorry she lost
her church, but-

03:57.838 --> 03:59.404
No, no, she lost
her community.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.672
<i> Her life was</i>
<i> stolen from her,</i>

04:00.708 --> 04:02.708
<i> And when the city took</i>
<i> her family's land</i>

04:02.710 --> 04:03.742
That was the
beginning of the end.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.310
Steve:
<i> Look, the jury</i>
<i> wasn't persuaded</i>

04:05.346 --> 04:07.745
And you know this sob story
is not gonna work on me.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.148
Marcie:
<i> Okay, but a twenty year</i>
<i> sentence, steve,</i>

04:10.217 --> 04:11.683

04:11.818 --> 04:13.551
After everything this
woman's been through?

04:13.621 --> 04:15.353
What about reed izard?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.354
His family?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.489
What about what
they've been through?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.357
Or how about the six
other violent crimes

04:19.426 --> 04:21.025
<i> Jojo's been convicted of?</i>

04:21.061 --> 04:23.628
Okay, she has ptsd, steve.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.963
<i> And the psych eval</i>
<i> will attribute it</i>

04:25.098 --> 04:26.698
<i> To her time in</i>
<i> federal prison.</i>

04:26.734 --> 04:29.768
She was terrorized in
there by another inmate,

04:29.770 --> 04:31.436
And when she tried
to fight back,

04:31.438 --> 04:34.172
She was put in solitary
confinement for months.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.240
<i> Come on, she's on meds.</i>

04:35.242 --> 04:36.374
<i> She's doing therapy.</i>

04:36.510 --> 04:38.710
That's very sad, marcie,
and I-I mean that,

04:38.845 --> 04:39.911
But it's not my concern.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.579
My concern is keeping
a convicted killer

04:41.615 --> 04:42.580
Off the streets.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.782
Let's just wait and see

04:43.851 --> 04:45.784
What the pre-sentencing
report says.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.120
I think if you see
jojo's life all laid out,

04:49.189 --> 04:50.188
<i> You'll reconsider.</i>

04:50.190 --> 04:51.289
I've already seen it.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.256
But I...

04:52.293 --> 04:53.191
It arrived after you called.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.294
I-I read it before
I came over here.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.695
I called half hour ago.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.862
Steve:
<i> Well, there wasn't much</i>
<i> in there to be honest,</i>

04:57.898 --> 04:59.164
And certainly nothing
to convince me

04:59.233 --> 05:01.066
Your client
deserves leniency.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.333
(marcie scoffs)

05:02.335 --> 05:03.601
Well, thanks for getting me
out of the office, marcie.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.203
I appreciate it.
I'll see ya.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.946
What the hell is
all this percy?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.348
You wanted change.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.417
Oh, the realtor's
coming by tomorrow.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.219
You voted for this,
colleen, remember?

05:21.288 --> 05:23.087
Everyone under one roof.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.222
Wait, you're selling
the building?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.757
Well, there's more than
enough room for everyone

05:25.826 --> 05:27.225
At clayton park.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.694

We got those bastards!

05:45.346 --> 05:46.911
This video very
clearly shows you

05:46.980 --> 05:48.780
Throwing a punch at
a police officer.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.681
Doesn't change the fact
that they barged in

05:50.718 --> 05:53.552
And accused me of drunk driving
with no evidence whatsoever.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.853
Well, you look pretty drunk.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.289
I was drunk because
I was in my own house,

05:57.291 --> 05:59.657
Drinking to excess,
which is legal for me to do!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.526
Assaulting a police
officer, however...

06:01.528 --> 06:02.927
I'll plea to that, whatever.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.197
But I'm not lettin'
this dui thing go.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.199
My fans are gonna lose their
minds when they hear about it.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.266
Fans?

06:08.302 --> 06:09.601
Of my news site.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.569

podcast a few months ago.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.938

06:17.344 --> 06:18.543
To make your own
arrest a cause celeb.

06:18.678 --> 06:19.945
Look, he's got me
in a chokehold.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.012

<i> You! Buddy!</i>

06:24.084 --> 06:25.483
Who's that guy that

Mr. Broward.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.965
Help you?

06:40.967 --> 06:42.834
My name's marcie diggs.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.235
Jojo carvery's attorney.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.839
Can I talk to you about
the pre-sentence report

06:47.908 --> 06:49.040
That you wrote?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.175
Okay, but make it quick.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.776
I'm due to testify
any minute.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.913
That report is barely
three pages long

06:54.982 --> 06:57.249
And all it talks about
is her criminal record.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.851
I'm her probation officer,
not her biographer.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.119
Okay, but you,

07:01.254 --> 07:03.255
You mentioned nothing
about her background

07:03.390 --> 07:05.457
Or her upbringing.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.991
Did you even talk to her?

07:08.595 --> 07:11.062
Her sister? Her boss?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.665
<i> Jojo's been working in a</i>
<i> bakery for the last six years</i>

07:13.800 --> 07:16.400
And her boss says she's
the most reliable employee

07:16.437 --> 07:17.735
That he's ever had.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.905
She's also a 62 year old with
a rap sheet as long as my arm.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.675
Look, I've been down
this road with jojo.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.144
I'm guessin' I know
her better than you.

07:26.213 --> 07:30.081
Oh, so you're saying that this
is your second or third time

07:30.150 --> 07:31.883
Writing a report
for jojo and what?

07:31.952 --> 07:35.420
You just recycle the
same half-assed document

07:35.422 --> 07:36.787
You wrote back then, huh?

07:39.927 --> 07:42.894
Bill:
<i> You wanna go all ken burns</i>
<i> on the life of jojo carvery,</i>

07:42.930 --> 07:44.295
Be my guest.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.900
Can you tell me what your
husband was yelling

07:48.936 --> 07:50.268
At the officers?

07:51.205 --> 07:52.303
Well, there was
some bad language.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.238
That's okay,
I won't judge.

07:54.274 --> 07:57.275
"why the heck am I being
harassed in my own home?"

07:57.410 --> 07:58.977
He didn't say heck, but...

07:59.112 --> 08:00.845
And what made your
husband so belligerent?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.881
Well, neil runs
a news blog.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.318
It covers local policing,
municipal politics.

08:08.255 --> 08:12.557
He also has a podcast with a
steadily growing listenership.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.260
He thought maybe he
was being harassed

08:15.262 --> 08:16.528
Because of his reporting.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.462
Avery:
<i> Hm. Can you tell me how</i>
<i> long you were home</i>

08:18.499 --> 08:19.797
Before the police arrived?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.399
Twenty, maybe thirty minutes.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.134
Avery:
<i> And would you agree that</i>
<i> your husband was intoxicated</i>

08:23.136 --> 08:24.202
When they arrived?

08:24.271 --> 08:26.471
Yes but only because he'd
gotten into the whiskey

08:26.473 --> 08:27.539
Once we arrived home.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.907
So he was drunk
and pretty hostile

08:28.976 --> 08:30.308
Right outta the gate,
it sounds like.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.744
Nancy:
<i> No, I wouldn't say hostile.</i>

08:32.879 --> 08:34.712
Neil just gets
worked up sometimes.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.113
Avery:
<i> Worked up to the extent</i>

08:36.149 --> 08:38.115
That he threw a punch
at officer james.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.419
<i> Mrs. Boyle?</i>

08:42.589 --> 08:44.288
Did your husband throw a
punch at officer james?

08:44.324 --> 08:45.623
Yes or no?

08:46.226 --> 08:47.225
Yes.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.560
Avery:
<i> Thank you.</i>

08:48.562 --> 08:52.664
(tense music)

08:52.666 --> 08:53.831
Marcie:
<i> Dad?</i>

08:54.268 --> 08:55.233
<i> What?</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:57.302
What are you doing here?

08:57.304 --> 08:59.170
Austin:
<i> Just dropping by</i>
<i> to see my girl.</i>

08:59.306 --> 09:01.039
<i> Say hi, get caught up.</i>

09:02.175 --> 09:05.443
Get a little legal
advice while I'm at it.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.579
Well you caught me at
a really bad time, dad.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.980
I'm just here to
get some files

09:09.016 --> 09:10.648
And I'm heading
right back to court.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.651
It's this situation
with your mother.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.920
Tommy, you know,
he plays bass in the band?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.355
He's divorced.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.457
He, uh, he told me

09:19.526 --> 09:22.427
He moved out after a
fight just for two weeks,

09:22.496 --> 09:25.063
But his wife's lawyer said
he'd relinquished all claims

09:25.065 --> 09:26.398
To the family home.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.732
<i> The judge agreed.</i>

09:27.867 --> 09:30.001
Are we really talking
about divorce right now?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.403
Austin:
<i> No, it's just...</i>

09:32.639 --> 09:34.406
I don't know, I could
lose my claim to the house

09:34.541 --> 09:36.674
Because I went to stay with
your sister a few days.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.011
I can't be the one who you
talk to about this stuff.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.779
You-you get that, right?

09:41.848 --> 09:43.814
Well, can you
find me someone?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.217
Like a-

09:46.219 --> 09:48.286
Like a divorce lawyer?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.021
I need to know
where I stand.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.489
<i> Let me think about it.</i>

09:51.558 --> 09:53.257
Um, I'll find you someone.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.459
<i> Today?</i>
-Yes.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.827
I-I have to run.

09:58.899 --> 09:59.831
Love you.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.299
I love you, too.

10:01.434 --> 10:06.137
(gentle music)

10:06.272 --> 10:08.306
Michelle:
<i> So this is an example</i>
<i> of the peyote stitch</i>

10:08.441 --> 10:10.308
<i> From the</i>
<i> natoaganeg first nation</i>

10:11.979 --> 10:14.112
Ah, the man of the hour,

10:14.114 --> 10:15.914
My reliably
late ex-husband.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.248
(group snickers)

10:17.317 --> 10:19.617
Michelle:
<i> Bring it up.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

10:19.686 --> 10:21.986
And just in,
under the wire,

10:21.988 --> 10:25.857
We have that sample of appliqué
stitching that I promised you.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.397
<i> Can you imagine the panic</i>
<i> I felt when I realized</i>

10:32.532 --> 10:34.799
I didn't have any
samples from eskasoni?

10:34.801 --> 10:37.068
Well, no fear of me
telling anyone from home.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.070
How long you here for?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.672
Grab some lunch?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.475
We're here for
another few days.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.742
We?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.077
Me and dad.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.945
Your dad's here?

10:48.081 --> 10:50.081
What brings the chief
to the big, bad city?

10:52.386 --> 10:53.518
Chemo.

10:53.587 --> 10:54.985
<i> Cancer's in his liver.</i>

10:56.123 --> 10:58.289
Doctor's recommending
"aggressive" treatment.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.724
Oh, michelle, I'm sorry.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.460
He's being stoic.

11:03.063 --> 11:03.961
You know him.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.196
I do.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.765
No, no.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.568
Doug:
<i> I'd like to see him.</i>

11:10.637 --> 11:12.737
Doug. It's not a good idea.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.105
Doesn't he understand
that you and I have moved on

11:14.174 --> 11:15.173
From what happened?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.307
So has melanie.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.509
Michelle:
<i> Oh he understands.</i>

11:17.511 --> 11:19.444
He thinks we're both fools
for even talking to you.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.146
Well, give him my best.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.115
I will.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.317
He'll be delighted.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.551
(both chuckle)

11:29.456 --> 11:31.856
Judge morrison:
<i> What exactly is it you</i>
<i> think is missing from this,</i>

11:31.925 --> 11:33.191
Ms. Diggs?

11:33.260 --> 11:34.859
Marcie:
<i> Well, it reduces jojo</i>
<i> to her criminal record.</i>

11:34.928 --> 11:38.229
There's nothing about her
life, her job, her family.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.265
Your honour, everything my
colleague is discussing here,

11:40.400 --> 11:41.999
Ms. Carvery's background
and life experience,

11:42.035 --> 11:43.134
Would be covered in her

11:43.269 --> 11:44.669
Impact of race and
culture assessment.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.439
Marcie:
<i> Your honour, the irca</i>
<i> provided by mr. Broward,</i>

11:47.574 --> 11:50.808
A white male with no connection
to the black community,

11:50.877 --> 11:53.544
Simply fails to
capture the social

11:53.679 --> 11:56.948
And psychological fallout
the decimation of africville

11:57.017 --> 11:58.549
Had on jojo.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.420
<i> The impact of being ousted</i>
<i> from her home as a child.</i>

12:02.422 --> 12:04.622
Why, because the city of
halifax didn't want blacks

12:04.691 --> 12:06.758
Living on such a
choice piece of land?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.928
<i> I simply feel the</i>
<i> court owes jojo</i>

12:09.930 --> 12:11.662
A fair hearing
of her story.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.298
Steve:
<i> And we submit the court owes</i>
<i> it to the family of the victim</i>

12:14.367 --> 12:17.301
To carry out justice swiftly
and without delay, your honour.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.839
Ms. Diggs, you have
72 hours to proffer

12:21.975 --> 12:24.008
An amendment irca
to this court.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.544
<i> Any new information</i>
<i> that you find,</i>

12:26.580 --> 12:29.180
The court will take
it into account.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.117
(tense music)

12:34.788 --> 12:37.121
In
<i> front of seaview united.</i>

12:37.124 --> 12:39.456
<i> The original one,</i>
<i> before it was torn down.</i>

12:39.493 --> 12:41.860
Church was the
first thing to go.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.862
The city had come in
the middle of the night.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.331
That's how they did it,
house by house.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.767
Must have been so awful.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.270
Betty:
<i> Every day,</i>
<i> another house gone.</i>

12:52.272 --> 12:54.005
<i> My aunt refused to leave.</i>

12:54.074 --> 12:55.139
They bulldozed her place

12:55.208 --> 12:57.341
While she was away
overnight in the hospital.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.877
She didn't even get the
$500 they were offering.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.814
<i> They said africville</i>
<i> was a slum,</i>

13:02.949 --> 13:04.949
<i> That's why we</i>
<i> couldn't stay.</i>

13:04.951 --> 13:06.884
But we had backyards,
gardens.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.152
We'd get up in the morning,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.387
Run down to the sea
and jump in the water.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.891
Places they put us
were the slums.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.965
Marcie:
<i> Mm, you girls</i>
<i> look so happy.</i>

13:21.001 --> 13:22.800
Betty:
<i> Jojo wanted to go home.</i>

13:23.703 --> 13:25.503
<i> One day she just</i>
<i> started walking.</i>

13:25.638 --> 13:27.572
Police picked her up and
that's how she got sent

13:27.641 --> 13:28.840
To a foster family.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.241
Just like that?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.243
Betty:
<i> Social worker said our</i>
<i> mother was overwhelmed,</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:34.445
Said she couldn't
handle jojo.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.780
She'd just had
our baby brother.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.981
She was afraid
if she argued,

13:36.983 --> 13:38.916
They'd take him
away too, and me.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.986
And how long
was jojo gone?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.187
About a year.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.590
She came back and
got into mischief,

13:45.659 --> 13:46.991
Shoplifting and such.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.728
Later on, she took up
with some fast boys.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.263
They were the ones got her
involved in that robbery

13:52.299 --> 13:54.231
Where someone got killed.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.867
And jojo was eighteen?

13:55.936 --> 13:57.134
Betty:
<i> Right.</i>

13:57.136 --> 13:59.070
Eight years she
was in prison.

13:59.205 --> 14:01.339
That was what
really changed her.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.875
She wasn't the sister
I remembered anymore.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.309
That girl was gone.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.950
Marcie:
<i> Is-is that why you didn't</i>
<i> come to jojo's trial?</i>

14:13.720 --> 14:15.086
Things have been
hard for my daughter

14:15.155 --> 14:17.021
Since what
happened to reed.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.556
Lucy doesn't wanna
know jojo anymore,

14:18.691 --> 14:20.591
And I'm just trying
to keep the peace.

14:22.996 --> 14:26.630
Who do you think
might remember jojo

14:26.666 --> 14:28.566
<i> From before she</i>
<i> went to prison?</i>

14:28.701 --> 14:30.167
<i> Might wanna speak</i>
<i> up for her?</i>

14:30.203 --> 14:32.704
You could try her lawyer,
anthony barclay.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.305
<i> He said jojo was innocent.</i>

14:34.341 --> 14:35.506
<i> Would have done</i>
<i> anything for her.</i>

14:35.542 --> 14:36.974
Barclay?
-<i> Mmhmm.</i>

14:39.045 --> 14:40.111
Colleen:
<i> Officer james,</i>

14:40.113 --> 14:42.013
What can you tell
me about this man?

14:44.551 --> 14:45.582
<i> Right there,</i>

14:45.619 --> 14:47.518
<i> Watching you</i>
<i> arrest my client.</i>

14:47.554 --> 14:48.519
Officer james:
<i> Just a gawker.</i>

14:48.555 --> 14:49.654
Colleen:
<i> Did you get a name?</i>

14:49.723 --> 14:50.955
Take a statement?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.657
Avery:
<i> I'm sorry, your honour,</i>
<i> but where is this going?</i>

14:52.726 --> 14:54.191
Colleen:
<i> I think it's obvious.</i>

14:54.227 --> 14:56.126
This gentleman needs to
be on the witness list.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.062
Judge paulson:
<i> Well, if you can find him,</i>
<i> ms. Mcdonnell,</i>

14:58.197 --> 14:59.797
The court will hear
his testimony.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.070
You crappy piece of crap!

15:07.206 --> 15:08.606
<i> Garbage machine!</i>

15:08.675 --> 15:09.873
Hello?

15:10.743 --> 15:11.709
Hi.

15:11.711 --> 15:12.977
Hi.
-<i> Sorry.</i>

15:13.913 --> 15:14.846
Did you have
an appointment?

15:14.981 --> 15:18.082
Um, I'm actually looking
for anthony barclay?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.350
Oh, that's me!

15:20.487 --> 15:23.821
Anthony barclay who
represented jojo carvery

15:23.890 --> 15:25.222
<i> Forty years ago?</i>

15:27.227 --> 15:29.761
Ah, that would be my dad.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.162
Tony junior.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.365
(train horn tooting)

15:37.270 --> 15:38.903
Tony:
<i> Amazed I found this</i>
<i> without harriet.</i>

15:38.905 --> 15:40.838
Her filing system's
a bit baroque.

15:40.907 --> 15:43.040
You ever think of hiring
some help for harriet?

15:43.109 --> 15:44.776
Oh, she'd never allow it.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.511
Plus, she works cheap.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.512
Business isn't
exactly booming.

15:48.514 --> 15:49.514
Yeah.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.348
Well, I'll spread the word.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.319
I appreciate that.
-Mmmhmm.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.353
Tony:
<i> Okay, this is</i>
<i> the mother lode.</i>

15:56.389 --> 15:57.956
All dad's notes
on the case,

15:58.091 --> 15:59.057
All the filings.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.391
What do you need exactly?

16:00.393 --> 16:02.126
Marcie:
<i> Well, betty said</i>
<i> that your dad</i>

16:02.261 --> 16:04.062
Thought that jojo
was innocent.

16:04.064 --> 16:07.131
Is, is there anything in
there that might tell me why?

16:08.101 --> 16:09.767
Tony:
<i> Police reports,</i>

16:09.769 --> 16:11.568
<i> All the witness statements.</i>

16:15.442 --> 16:16.707
Okay.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.609
This is why.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.111
This is why right here.

16:21.881 --> 16:25.016
(ominous music)

16:25.018 --> 16:26.351
Wendell brown.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.954
It's one of the boys that
she was arrested with.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.857
<i> He testified that she wasn't</i>
<i> a part of the robbery</i>

16:32.992 --> 16:34.892
But the judge
cautioned the jury

16:34.961 --> 16:38.496
That the statement had
limited probative value.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.930
I guess 'cause he
saw it as wendell

16:40.000 --> 16:41.699
Trying to help out
his girlfriend.

16:41.701 --> 16:46.237
(tense music)

16:46.306 --> 16:50.641
You know she served eight
years for a first time offence?

16:50.643 --> 16:53.544
<i> If this would have just</i>
<i> been properly considered,</i>

16:54.981 --> 16:56.914
It would have changed
everything for her.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.384
(seagulls squawking)
(boat horn tooting)

16:59.519 --> 17:00.852
Michelle:
<i> He asked to see you.</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:03.587
Really?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

17:03.656 --> 17:05.756
No cursing, no yelling.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.459
No screwing up his face
like he wants to spit.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.095
<i> It was just,</i>
<i> "oh yeah, doug.</i>

17:11.164 --> 17:12.563
"have him come by."

17:13.800 --> 17:15.132
Did he say why?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.436
He's facing the
end of his life.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.739
<i> Maybe the chief's ready</i>
<i> to let go of old grudges.</i>

17:22.609 --> 17:24.042
Let you come back home.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.412
Wouldn't wanna
get my hopes up.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.481
But what else could it be?

17:30.616 --> 17:33.484
Doug, I think this
could really be it.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.091
Percy:
<i> All right, so just up</i>
<i> here is the lunch room.</i>

17:40.093 --> 17:41.959
I'll take you down to the
basement after to, uh-

17:42.028 --> 17:43.027
<i> Hey colleen.</i>

17:43.029 --> 17:45.029
This is rick,
the realtor.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.097
Rick.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.498
Rick says we can have
the building on the market

17:47.567 --> 17:49.200
By the end of the week.

17:49.335 --> 17:50.501
Wait, this week?

17:51.771 --> 17:52.503
<i> Wait, you're expecting</i>
<i> us to pack up and be out-</i>

17:52.539 --> 17:53.637
(phone ringing)

17:53.706 --> 17:55.039
Dammit!

17:55.041 --> 17:56.673
Percy, we really need
to talk about this.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.675
My door is always open,
colleen.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.912
Hey neil, what's up?

18:01.047 --> 18:02.513
Neil:
<i> I found him for ya, coll!</i>

18:02.515 --> 18:03.848
Found who?

18:03.850 --> 18:05.116
Don't-don't call me coll.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.584
Neil:
<i> Our mysterious witness.</i>

18:06.586 --> 18:08.519
Same guy the
entire halifax pd

18:08.521 --> 18:10.387
Had no idea whatsoever
how to find.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.689
How did you find him?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.925
Cctv footage from
the corner store.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.059
He lives around here,

18:15.128 --> 18:16.861
Figured he'd show up on
camera at some point.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.963
Six hours of
footage later...

18:20.366 --> 18:22.666
Okay, how do we
find this guy?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.668
Neil:
<i> Three doors down</i>
<i> from my house.</i>

18:26.606 --> 18:27.872
Marcie:
<i> This conviction</i>

18:27.874 --> 18:30.675
<i> Is where everything started</i>
<i> to go wrong for jojo.</i>

18:30.810 --> 18:32.342
Eight years in prison

18:32.378 --> 18:35.446
And her sister says she
was irrevocably changed.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.015
<i> And after that came</i>
<i> the mental illness,</i>

18:38.084 --> 18:39.750
The drug abuse,
the alcohol abuse-

18:39.819 --> 18:43.020
The multiple convictions,
the parole violations.

18:43.089 --> 18:46.090
And now it looks like
she may have been innocent.

18:46.092 --> 18:49.360
Well, she's found guilty
by a judge and jury.

18:49.495 --> 18:52.964
Steve, the system is supposed
to rehabilitate people

18:53.099 --> 18:54.098
Not ruin them.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.233
What-what do you
want, marcie?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.500
I don't have a
time machine.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.968
Take this into account!

18:59.005 --> 19:00.638
Okay, as long as you
return the favour.

19:00.707 --> 19:06.644
(ominous music)

19:06.713 --> 19:09.647
♪

19:09.649 --> 19:12.449
(background chatter)

19:12.485 --> 19:15.987
(heavy rock music)

19:16.122 --> 19:17.188
Colleen:
<i> Hello, um-</i>

19:17.257 --> 19:19.190
I understand a
paul mcphail lives here.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.591
<i> Would that be you?</i>

19:20.627 --> 19:22.193
(heavy rock music)

19:22.328 --> 19:24.028
I represent one of your
neighbours, neil boyle?

19:24.097 --> 19:25.596
I don't know any neil.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.332
Ah, you were a witness to
an altercation last month?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.067
My client was arrested
in front of his home-

19:30.103 --> 19:31.535
Don't know what
you're talking about.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.070
Actually, you were
caught on camera

19:33.106 --> 19:35.006
Watching the whole
thing transpire.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.373
We would-we would love
for you to testify-

19:36.442 --> 19:37.641
No.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.744
Think of it as
an opportunity

19:40.780 --> 19:42.213
To stand up
against police-

19:42.348 --> 19:43.214
(door slams)

19:43.349 --> 19:45.416
Hey! (scoffs)

19:45.485 --> 19:46.817
I can have you
subpoenaed!

19:48.488 --> 19:49.420
Hey dad.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.155
No, I'm sorry, I just,

19:51.157 --> 19:52.089
I've been in the middle of-

19:52.158 --> 19:53.624
Austin:
<i> I know,</i>
<i> you always are.</i>

19:53.693 --> 19:56.494
<i> But you said you were gonna</i>
<i> find me someone, today.</i>

19:56.496 --> 19:58.028
Actually, I did!

19:58.064 --> 20:01.699
I did. I found I think
someone really great.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.633
I will send you
his contacts.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.701
Austin:
<i> That's great.</i>

20:03.703 --> 20:04.902
(phone beeps)

20:06.839 --> 20:09.240
Daddy, actually I-I've
gotta-I've gotta take this call.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.307
Austin:
<i> Okay, I love you.</i>

20:10.443 --> 20:11.642
I love you, too.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.245
Marcie diggs.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.913
Hdm bailiff:
<i> Ms. Diggs, I'm calling</i>
<i> about wendell brown.</i>

20:16.950 --> 20:18.315
Ah, you found him.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.383
Hdm bailiff:
<i> We did.</i>

20:19.385 --> 20:20.684
Wendell brown?
-<i> That's right.</i>

20:20.753 --> 20:22.720
I'm gonna come in
on your operation,

20:22.722 --> 20:25.456
We gotta establish
a few ground rules.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.259
I bring certain
resources to the table,

20:28.261 --> 20:30.895
So I say how
business gets done.

20:30.897 --> 20:31.996
Okay grandpa.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.097
Plus 20% of the take.

20:34.968 --> 20:35.866
(car door shuts)

20:36.002 --> 20:36.933
Hey there.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.068
<i> Hey.</i>

20:38.104 --> 20:39.136
Marcie:
<i> How's business?</i>

20:39.272 --> 20:40.404
You're our afternoon rush.

20:40.406 --> 20:41.738
Marcie:
(chuckles)<i> oh.</i>

20:41.774 --> 20:43.206
<i> Well, in that case.</i>

20:43.743 --> 20:44.875
Hey.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.446
Thank you.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.218
Sorry it's a little warm,

20:54.220 --> 20:55.218
We ran outta ice.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.353
I can go get some.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.587
Wendell:
<i> Yeah.</i>

21:01.227 --> 21:04.361
So you wouldn't happen
to be wendell brown?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.164
Can I help you?

21:07.166 --> 21:09.566
I wanted to talk to
you about jojo carvery.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.771
Danny, it's time
to go inside.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.972
But I got ice!

21:14.974 --> 21:16.907
Wendell:
<i> Go inside now.</i>
<i> I'll be right in.</i>

21:18.644 --> 21:20.711
She really needs
your help.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.245
And I know that you
helped her before.

21:22.282 --> 21:26.517
Please, don't contact
me or my family again.

21:26.652 --> 21:34.591
(tense music)

21:38.598 --> 21:39.864
Judge paulson:
<i> Where's your witness,</i>
<i> counsellor?</i>

21:39.999 --> 21:40.998
Sorry, your honour.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.966
I had a feeling mr. Mcphail
might not show up.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.735
He didn't show a
lot of enthusiasm

21:44.870 --> 21:46.003
For the idea
when we spoke.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.138
Avery:
<i> Your honour,</i>
<i> all due respect,</i>

21:47.273 --> 21:48.606
This is just a
delay tactic.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.275
It's not for counsel
to determine the value

21:51.277 --> 21:52.543
Of mr. Mcphail's testimony.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.313
<i> My client has every right to</i>
<i> have this witness' testimony</i>

21:55.448 --> 21:56.647
Entered into the record.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.282
Judge paulson:
<i> Okay, let's reconvene</i>
<i> this afternoon.</i>

21:59.319 --> 22:03.220
I'll send someone to fetch
the elusive mr. Mcphail,

22:03.289 --> 22:05.790
And if he's not here,
we'll talk about next steps.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.057
Thank you.

22:18.271 --> 22:20.271
Did you have anything
to do with this?

22:20.273 --> 22:21.605
That's aggressive.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.641
What a liar that man is!

22:23.643 --> 22:27.110
"oh, I'll just stay at emily's
for a few days, cool off.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.979
"everything's just fine."

22:29.048 --> 22:31.114
And then boom!
This attack!

22:31.150 --> 22:32.249
It's just lawyer-speak.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.350
I know it feels hardass-

22:33.386 --> 22:35.185
You're in this,
aren't you, marcie?

22:35.988 --> 22:37.287
I just gave him a name.

22:37.323 --> 22:38.488
So you're on his side?

22:38.524 --> 22:40.591
I'm not on anyone's
side, mom.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.326
Hm. You tell him this.

22:42.328 --> 22:45.796
If he wants to play hardball,
I can play hardball too!

22:52.138 --> 22:57.574
My girls, they think I
should let old grudges go.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.279
Forget how you made
my girls a punchline.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.084
Especially now,
michelle says.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.485
I gather you disagree.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.090
Now that you're a father,

23:14.260 --> 23:16.427
I wonder if you can
understand how you'd feel

23:18.064 --> 23:20.231
If someone were to
hurt your children.

23:20.366 --> 23:21.565
Doug:
<i> No offence tom,</i>

23:21.700 --> 23:24.701
But my daughters,
your granddaughters,

23:24.737 --> 23:26.636
Are almost fully grown up.

23:26.672 --> 23:29.173
<i> This is some pretty old</i>
<i> ground we're covering.</i>

23:29.242 --> 23:32.309
And I should be over it,
is that it?

23:32.378 --> 23:33.944
Why am I here?

23:34.079 --> 23:35.378
Because you owe me.

23:36.716 --> 23:37.848
Is that right?

23:37.983 --> 23:41.351
After all the pain you caused,
you're damn right you do.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.858
I'm not going
to get better.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.292
I know that.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.798
I need you to help me
to arrange my death.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.869
Help me find a doctor
who will assist,

23:58.905 --> 24:01.872
And make sure the
process goes smoothly.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.143
I wanna be able to do it
while I'm still capable

24:06.212 --> 24:08.479
Of administering
the drug to myself.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.713
Doug:
<i> Sure.</i>

24:10.449 --> 24:12.349
Assisted dying is legal.

24:12.485 --> 24:13.917
And it's my choice.

24:15.888 --> 24:18.188
The girls won't understand.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.523
What?

24:19.658 --> 24:21.358
(sombre music)

24:21.394 --> 24:22.559
You have to tell them.

24:22.695 --> 24:26.497
Once everything is in place,
only then.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.166
You can say nothing
to michelle.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.505
You wanna come home?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.776
This is how you
make restitution.

24:38.778 --> 24:44.048
(sombre music)

24:44.183 --> 24:45.415
(doug sighs)

24:46.585 --> 24:47.884
Wendell brown?

24:48.921 --> 24:51.321
Lord, when have I
heard that name last?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.356
(chuckles)

24:54.560 --> 24:56.393
Was he your boyfriend?

24:56.395 --> 24:57.595
Jojo:
<i> Oh, more than that.</i>

24:57.597 --> 24:58.996
He was a friend.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.000
He wrote me in
jail for years.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.002
<i> Said it changed him,</i>

25:06.805 --> 25:08.371
Seeing me go away.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.742
Never cared that
much about himself.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.077
But he realized
someone he loved

25:15.481 --> 25:20.450
Could be hurt
by his actions.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.654
<i> So he turned</i>
<i> things around.</i>

25:24.690 --> 25:26.557
Well it seems like
he's had a good life.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.626
He's got a granddaughter.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.626
<i> A home.</i>

25:29.662 --> 25:32.296
He was always very smart.
(chuckles)

25:32.365 --> 25:33.931
And a beautiful writer.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.833
<i> Oh, I saved every</i>
<i> one of his letters.</i>

25:38.804 --> 25:41.305
You wouldn't
happen to know

25:41.307 --> 25:43.106
Where I'd find
those letters now?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.774
Oh, betty holds
onto 'em for me,

25:44.810 --> 25:46.844
Along with a few mementos.

25:50.649 --> 25:51.915
What did he say?

25:52.552 --> 25:53.917
Can you come home?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.520
That's not what he
wanted to discuss.

25:56.655 --> 25:57.888
But then what?

25:58.925 --> 26:00.924
It was, um,
a private conversation.

26:00.993 --> 26:01.992
Oh.

26:02.127 --> 26:02.993
Doug:
<i> I can't talk about</i>
<i> it, michelle.</i>

26:02.995 --> 26:04.128
You're kidding me.

26:04.130 --> 26:04.995
You're shutting me out?

26:05.031 --> 26:06.630
What the hell's
going on here?

26:07.633 --> 26:08.798
I'm sorry.

26:10.303 --> 26:11.468
You know what,

26:11.537 --> 26:14.405
This is feeling a bit too much
like old times right now.

26:21.414 --> 26:24.848
It's great to finally
meet you mr. Mcphail.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.685
Clerk:
<i> You can swear on a</i>
<i> holy book or affirm.</i>

26:27.687 --> 26:28.885
No.

26:30.956 --> 26:34.157
Do you promise to tell
the truth at the very least?

26:34.193 --> 26:35.992
(paul sighs)

26:39.532 --> 26:41.565
What would you like
me to do here?

26:41.567 --> 26:44.635
Colleen:
<i> Your honour, we feel he has</i>
<i> relevant evidence to give.</i>

26:44.704 --> 26:46.870
Um, we'd like him to
remain in custody

26:46.872 --> 26:49.439
Given the difficulty in
obtaining his presence.

26:49.475 --> 26:51.441
Judge paulson:
<i> Mr. Mcphail, we're</i>
<i> going to give you time</i>

26:51.477 --> 26:52.843
To think about
her decision

26:52.978 --> 26:55.478
<i> And seek independent</i>
<i> legal counsel.</i>

26:55.514 --> 26:58.849
We're here till 4:30 and back
tomorrow morning at 9:30.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.250
Whatever.

You're the judge.

27:02.922 --> 27:06.924
Sheriff, please show our
mysterious friend to his cell.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.475
(doorbell rings)

27:28.280 --> 27:31.482
So, what's going on?

27:31.617 --> 27:33.550
I just got a voicemail
from your mother.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.087
I think I might've
made things worse.

27:37.123 --> 27:40.157
Marcie:
<i> Dad, why would you</i>
<i> send her that letter?</i>

27:40.292 --> 27:42.760
Tony said it was in
my best interests.

27:42.762 --> 27:43.694
Thank you.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.095
Mom thinks you
declared war.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.731
Well, he said we had
to come out swingin'.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.132
Thanks, tony.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.169
What you got there?

27:52.304 --> 27:56.539
Some letters written by
a man who was madly in love

27:57.109 --> 27:58.241
<i> Forty years ago.</i>

27:58.277 --> 27:59.676
I remember that feeling.

28:01.647 --> 28:03.213
Never goes away exactly.

28:04.283 --> 28:07.918
Changes, deepens. (chuckles)

28:07.920 --> 28:09.886
Lord knows it gets
a little bit messy.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.923
But no,

28:12.925 --> 28:14.858
That kinda love
never goes away.

28:16.595 --> 28:18.195
Hm.

Marcie:
<i> That woman who you wrote</i>
<i> that beautiful letter to,</i>

28:31.444 --> 28:33.610
<i> She's facing the rest</i>
<i> of her life in prison.</i>

28:35.247 --> 28:36.714
Possibly dying there.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.686
Will you help her?

28:42.688 --> 28:50.426

was a good man.

29:30.703 --> 29:32.603
<i> He didn't always</i>
<i> do things right,</i>

29:32.738 --> 29:35.272

29:38.610 --> 29:42.312
<i> He checked in on me,</i>
<i> ran off bad boyfriends.</i>

29:43.782 --> 29:47.250
All he was doing that day was
trying to have a conversation.

She didn't have
to kill him.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.870
Man came out of the bedroom
waving a hunting rifle.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.771
My boy emmett
had a pistol.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.508
Bullet went right

30:12.545 --> 30:15.445
<i> We ran outta that house</i>

30:15.581 --> 30:17.914

what had happened?

30:18.984 --> 30:20.950
Didn't even know
why we were there.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.454

longer than me.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.446
It's like that murder
didn't even happen.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.815
That man's death

30:51.884 --> 30:54.784
Steve:
<i> You wrote to jojo for many</i>
<i> years after her conviction,</i>

30:54.854 --> 30:56.953
But you stopped
after she got out.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.488
Why'd you stop?

30:58.490 --> 31:01.491
We just fell outta touch.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.959
Steve:
<i> Did it have anything</i>
<i> to do with the fact</i>

31:02.995 --> 31:05.796
<i> That jojo was almost</i>
<i> immediately convicted again</i>

31:05.931 --> 31:07.731
<i> Of yet another</i>

31:09.168 --> 31:10.467
Wendell:
<i> No.</i>

31:10.469 --> 31:12.669
Steve:
<i> Maybe she didn't seem so</i>
<i> innocent to you anymore.</i>

31:13.973 --> 31:15.639
<i> And then she just kept getting</i>
<i> into trouble after that,</i>

31:15.774 --> 31:16.873
Didn't she?

31:16.876 --> 31:18.041
I-I didn't know
anything about the-

31:18.043 --> 31:19.509
Steve:
<i> Why would you?</i>

31:19.578 --> 31:21.377
<i> You were trying to turn</i>
<i> your life around, right?</i>

31:21.413 --> 31:22.646
Trying to make
amends for a crime

31:22.715 --> 31:24.047
That was clearly
eating away at you.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.049
I mean, that's the real reason
you're here today, isn't it?

31:26.051 --> 31:27.718
<i> To make amends?</i>

31:27.720 --> 31:29.453

31:30.789 --> 31:31.988

31:32.057 --> 31:34.057
Back to life,
but, you know,

31:34.093 --> 31:37.461
Maybe if you save jojo,
well, all will be forgiven.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.631
<i> The thing is mr. Brown,</i>
<i> jojo never had your problem.</i>

31:42.034 --> 31:44.935
She was never bothered by her
conscience the way you were.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.405
<i> And that's clearly</i>
<i> seen in her extensive</i>

31:48.540 --> 31:52.275
<i> And violent criminal record</i>
<i> that spans forty years.</i>

32:03.055 --> 32:04.387
Doug:
<i> You didn't</i>
<i> return my texts.</i>

32:06.425 --> 32:08.492
I'm sorry about yesterday.

32:08.627 --> 32:11.094
<i> He's my father and he's</i>
<i> likely going to die.</i>

32:12.331 --> 32:14.530
I'm on a bit of an emotional
knife edge, I'm just...

32:15.067 --> 32:16.133
I get it.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.034
Michelle:
<i> That's the rational part.</i>

32:18.070 --> 32:20.837
The irrational part is you
keeping things from me.

32:20.839 --> 32:23.239
<i> After everything</i>
<i> we went through.</i>

32:23.275 --> 32:27.610
<i> All the lies and all my anger</i>
<i> at you just came rushing back.</i>

32:27.680 --> 32:29.212
That's not so irrational.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.214
And I know he's sworn
you to secrecy or whatever,

32:31.283 --> 32:35.585
But I'm the one that has
to cope with him dying.

32:36.855 --> 32:39.088
<i> I'm the one that has</i>
<i> to tell his grandkids.</i>

32:39.992 --> 32:41.257
<i> I gotta get back in there.</i>

32:41.293 --> 32:42.592
I'll come with you.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.530
I'd rather you didn't, doug.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.136
Colleen:
<i> Hey.</i>

32:53.271 --> 32:54.203
Hey, what's up?

32:54.239 --> 32:56.406
I'm just about to deal
with this meeting.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.908
Neil sent me this photo.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.543
<i> Our guy is back</i>
<i> on the street.</i>

33:01.780 --> 33:03.113
It's funny, huh?

33:04.516 --> 33:05.882
<i> What's going on here, avery?</i>

33:07.286 --> 33:09.686
Look, let's just do six months
on the dui charges

33:09.688 --> 33:11.421
<i> And we'll dismiss</i>
<i> the other ones.</i>

33:14.293 --> 33:17.761
He's an undercover cop,
isn't he? (chuckles)

33:19.064 --> 33:21.365
Neil figures this whole thing
is a vendetta against him

33:21.500 --> 33:23.433
Because of his hard-hitting
police reporting.

33:23.568 --> 33:25.735
Okay, your client has
an inflated sense

33:25.804 --> 33:27.170
Of his own importance.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.438
All right, so this cop,

33:28.474 --> 33:30.173
Probably working
some other case,

33:30.242 --> 33:32.776
Must be huge,
maybe rcmp,

33:32.845 --> 33:35.579
<i> Basically blunders</i>
<i> his way onto camera,</i>

33:35.714 --> 33:37.748
Potentially
blowing his cover.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.483
Idiot.

33:42.121 --> 33:45.055
So, should I expect a
stay of the charges?

33:45.190 --> 33:46.122
If your client can promise

33:46.158 --> 33:48.125
To keep his curiosity
in check, yeah.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.393
As if. (scoffs)

33:50.862 --> 33:53.196
I'll, uh, I'll be expecting
the paperwork, avery.

33:56.835 --> 34:00.704
Jojo worked six years in
mr. Mason's bakery, no issues.

34:00.839 --> 34:03.173
He told me she was the
best employee he ever had.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.675
Marcie:
<i> So no drugs, no alcohol?</i>

34:05.744 --> 34:07.977
Run-ins with the
police during that time?

34:08.013 --> 34:10.614
Betty:
<i> No, the bakery</i>
<i> was good for her.</i>

34:10.749 --> 34:13.683
Things only changed when
her shift got moved around.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.219
<i> Jojo needs structure.</i>

34:16.255 --> 34:19.289
<i> Only found out once she</i>
<i> talked to the psychiatrist,</i>

34:19.358 --> 34:21.557
She's got social anxiety.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.694
That's why the
night shift worked out.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.028
But now that we know
what she needs,

34:26.065 --> 34:27.563
She can get treatment.

34:27.599 --> 34:30.767
Marcie:
<i> So you believe your sister's</i>
<i> capable of a productive,</i>

34:30.769 --> 34:31.968
Positive life?

34:32.037 --> 34:33.570
Betty:
<i> Absolutely,</i>
<i> yes, she is.</i>

34:33.572 --> 34:35.705
She just needs
that structure,

34:35.707 --> 34:36.973
That support.

34:37.109 --> 34:40.577
Mrs. Henson, if jojo
is released on probation,

34:40.646 --> 34:43.080
Who is there to
provide that support?

34:43.215 --> 34:45.115
<i> Can she rely on you?</i>

34:45.184 --> 34:47.951
(tense music)

34:48.020 --> 34:49.152
I...

34:49.822 --> 34:50.921
<i> I'm not sure if...</i>

34:52.691 --> 34:54.056
Judge morrison:
<i> Pardon, mrs. Henson?</i>

34:55.027 --> 34:56.392
I-I don't know.

34:59.297 --> 35:02.065
My family has been
through so much.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.866
<i> A man dead on my floor.</i>

35:07.206 --> 35:08.872
<i> I just don't know.</i>

35:08.941 --> 35:12.208
(pensive music)

35:12.244 --> 35:13.376
(phone ringing)

35:15.114 --> 35:17.079
Neil, it's too
early for updates.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.681
We won't hear anything back
from the crown for at least-

35:18.750 --> 35:21.684
Neil:
<i> Colleen, I just got a call</i>
<i> from someone at the hpd.</i>

35:21.753 --> 35:22.752
A superintendent.

35:22.887 --> 35:23.887
What did he say?

35:23.956 --> 35:25.488
Steve:
<i> She</i> said she wanted
me to, quote,

35:25.491 --> 35:27.023
"pay her a little visit".

35:27.092 --> 35:28.158
Asap.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.225

<i> You wanted to talk about</i>
<i> the amalgamation timeline?</i>

35:34.433 --> 35:35.699
Colleen:
<i> Neil, I'll meet you there.</i>

35:36.768 --> 35:37.967
I do.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.770
But I can't right now.

35:40.772 --> 35:43.573
Change can be scary, colleen.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.075
Colleen:
<i> Of course.</i>

35:45.077 --> 35:46.409
I voted for you didn't I?

35:47.079 --> 35:48.845
The candidate of change.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.848
Maybe this wasn't the
change you were after.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.519
We'll have to talk
about it later, percy.

35:56.588 --> 36:03.559

<i> Don't worry,</i>

<i> Mr. Boyle, thank you</i>
<i> for coming in.</i>

<i> client here?</i>

36:22.047 --> 36:23.079
We thought it only fair

36:23.148 --> 36:26.115
To compensate mr. Boyle
for his trouble.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.422
Ten thousand dollars?

Petrie:
<i> Consideration for any</i>

to forgo a civil suit.

Petrie:
<i> And we'd ask that mr. Boyle</i>
<i> agree to not discuss</i>
