00:19.603 --> 00:20.716
I'm down for it!

00:20.719 --> 00:23.077
I promise you the first time
I knew anything about the baby

00:23.099 --> 00:24.925
was the knock at the
door before our wedding.

00:26.999 --> 00:28.549
We're off to Syria in five weeks' time.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.258
I'd like you with us as our medic.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.149
You're safe now.

00:34.665 --> 00:35.799

Sh, I got you. It's OK. Sh. Sh. Sh.

01:25.350 --> 01:28.359
I got you. It's OK. Sh.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.265
Oh, look at you and your six-pack.

01:33.651 --> 01:34.970
Well, if you've got it...

01:41.247 --> 01:43.083
I've already told you
I can't do an interview,

01:43.085 --> 01:44.195
even if I wanted to.

01:45.839 --> 01:46.822
Ridiculous!

01:46.996 --> 01:48.119
Who was that?

01:48.332 --> 01:50.112
Journalist for the
Manchester Evening News,

01:50.117 --> 01:51.138
wants to do a piece.

01:51.515 --> 01:52.549
I don't know why they bother.

01:52.576 --> 01:55.288
I've told them they have to go
through the Army Press Office.

01:57.588 --> 01:59.337
Look, why don't you let me do breakfast?

01:59.834 --> 02:01.228
No, I'm OK.

02:01.876 --> 02:03.119
Thanks, though, babe.

03:55.639 --> 03:56.988

03:56.993 --> 03:58.452
for you to have one of
your Army mates here.

03:58.461 --> 04:01.248
Oh, really? All for me, then, Marie?

04:01.626 --> 04:03.113
Marie texted, so...

04:03.127 --> 04:04.241
That's all right, innit?

04:04.916 --> 04:06.581
Never go out with a soldier, Marie.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.655
We're just friends, aren't we, Fingers?

04:08.881 --> 04:10.102
Yeah, at the moment.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.276
Mum?

04:13.396 --> 04:14.416
Mum?

04:15.668 --> 04:17.160
- Oh, all right, love?
- Hiya.

04:17.164 --> 04:18.141
Hi.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.719
Yeah, just come to get
Jamie's charger. Mum...

04:20.947 --> 04:22.598
why is Fingers here?

04:22.900 --> 04:24.919
We've had them knocking
on the door, love, so

04:25.039 --> 04:27.220
it's good to have a
bit of added security.

04:27.255 --> 04:28.236
Who?

04:28.445 --> 04:30.078
Who do you think? The press and that.

04:30.273 --> 04:31.583
Right, don't tell them anything.

04:31.787 --> 04:34.242
- We won't.
- Yeah, and don't let them in, either.

04:34.797 --> 04:36.318
Right, I'm going for a shower.

04:36.714 --> 04:37.878
All right.

04:43.094 --> 04:45.567
So, you never told me that
it was Elvis that saved you.

04:46.348 --> 04:48.506
Fingers has got a gob on him, hasn't he?

04:48.879 --> 04:51.067
No, Elvis was part of the team.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.281
So, you did speak to him, then?

04:54.282 --> 04:56.035
Yes. He's got someone else...

04:56.155 --> 04:57.439
and a kiddie and that.

04:58.722 --> 04:59.991
And nothing happened?

05:00.679 --> 05:01.794
No.

05:03.956 --> 05:05.559
Not really, no.

05:07.079 --> 05:09.719
- Bloody hell, Georgie, what happened?
- Nothing.

05:12.218 --> 05:13.545
It was nothing.

05:17.159 --> 05:18.531
How could you?

05:18.651 --> 05:21.350
Marie, don't you dare say anything.

05:21.731 --> 05:23.684
Of course I won't say anything, Georgie.

05:23.879 --> 05:25.349
We're sisters, aren't we?

05:25.699 --> 05:27.564
We're supposed to lie for each other.

05:32.948 --> 05:34.959
We've got this fitting and
then there's the final fitting.

05:34.985 --> 05:36.947
Just don't put on any weight
between now and the wedding,

05:36.983 --> 05:38.985
that's my advice. Don't
do an Auntie Paula.

05:38.999 --> 05:40.020

Went to the first fitting,
by the time she turned up

05:41.667 --> 05:43.957
to her final fitting she
was eight months pregnant.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.875
You're not pregnant, are you, Georgie?

05:46.901 --> 05:48.539
- What?
- No, course not,

05:48.557 --> 05:50.240
you wouldn't be that
daft cos he's a doctor.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.264
Come here, you.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.812
- She looks gorgeous.
- Oh, it's definitely the one.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.110
Stunning.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.032
You look so beautiful.

06:04.479 --> 06:06.482
Seriously, Georgie,

06:06.752 --> 06:08.724
I've gone all goosey.

06:08.799 --> 06:10.078

06:32.618 --> 06:34.110
Oh. I'm sorry.

06:35.082 --> 06:36.640
You all right, love?

06:37.262 --> 06:39.246
I just thought you were
someone else, I'm sorry.

07:02.621 --> 07:04.081
Couldn't breathe in there, that's all.

07:04.108 --> 07:06.159
- Yeah, well, that'll be guilt.
- Piss off.

07:08.707 --> 07:10.496
You've got to be brave, right?

07:11.543 --> 07:13.381
What on earth are you doing, Georgie?

07:13.439 --> 07:15.463
She's seeing sense,
that's what's happened.

07:16.023 --> 07:18.419
- Wind your neck in.
- Mum, I'm sorry, I was really hot.

07:18.428 --> 07:20.528
No, it's all right,
love. It is hot in there.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.734
But the lady said she'd
turn the heating down, so...

07:22.854 --> 07:24.216
Oh, sorry, love.

07:24.665 --> 07:25.841
Are you OK?

07:26.039 --> 07:28.309
- Yeah.
- Come on, I've got you.

07:30.355 --> 07:32.943
Sorry. She just got
a bit hot, that's all.

07:32.987 --> 07:34.910
But everything's fine now, eh, Georgie?

07:35.158 --> 07:36.184
Yeah,

07:36.239 --> 07:37.533
sorry. Can I use your toilet?

07:37.546 --> 07:38.807
Of course, just through there.

07:39.486 --> 07:42.470
Try not to get any piss stains
on your train, eh, George?

08:12.250 --> 08:13.395
So...

08:14.280 --> 08:15.677
you marry Jamie,

08:16.366 --> 08:18.479
and you get it into your thick skull

08:19.127 --> 08:21.169
that you can never see Elvis again.

08:21.878 --> 08:23.775
You can't even think about him.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.284
I can't even sleep at night, Marie.

08:30.069 --> 08:31.439
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

08:39.503 --> 08:40.577
OK.

08:41.043 --> 08:42.279
OK, I'm fine.

08:44.772 --> 08:46.119
Everything's fine.

09:13.305 --> 09:15.906
Hi! I'm home!

09:29.856 --> 09:31.330
You've been published!

09:31.373 --> 09:34.494
- Mm-hm.
- Oh! That's amazing!

09:34.756 --> 09:37.051
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

09:37.239 --> 09:39.318
We'll have to get some
copies for your mum and dad.

09:39.395 --> 09:42.072
I ordered several... dozen!

09:43.035 --> 09:45.478
We'll save seven for each of
the children we're going to have.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.894
And my nan will want one as well.

09:46.903 --> 09:49.318
At least it'll give me something
to brag about during the Q and A.

09:50.180 --> 09:51.398
What Q and A?

09:51.518 --> 09:53.078
St George's tomorrow, remember?

09:53.079 --> 09:55.569
No. No, you never mentioned it.

09:56.590 --> 09:59.160
I could skip it if you need
me to stay here with you.

09:59.569 --> 10:00.962
What, in case I self-harm?

10:00.989 --> 10:03.430
Moved all the knives out of
the kitchen, just in case.

10:04.679 --> 10:06.378
So, you're going to London tomorrow?

10:07.022 --> 10:09.438
Yeah. Yeah, it's up and back in a day...

10:09.439 --> 10:11.550
I think I said, I mentioned?

10:11.670 --> 10:12.380
No.

10:12.393 --> 10:13.599
- No?
- Mm-mm.

10:14.089 --> 10:15.679
I didn't want to keep
banging on about it.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.913
You've got enough to worry about.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.156
You know what you should do?

10:18.529 --> 10:20.331
Take all the magazines
down and then just...

10:20.331 --> 10:22.160
just scatter them everywhere.

10:23.407 --> 10:25.638
Already e-mailed the professor
there and attached the piece.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.461
Said if it was of any use,

10:27.469 --> 10:29.085
he can let the students
read it before they meet me.

10:29.099 --> 10:31.789
Oh... so you're making
it out it's about them

10:31.799 --> 10:34.452
but it's really about you
blowing your own trumpet.

10:34.754 --> 10:36.197
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.279
Why don't I come?

10:48.225 --> 10:50.103
I've been wanting to
go to London for ages.

10:52.039 --> 10:53.166
You really want to come?

10:53.477 --> 10:54.955
Mm-hm, yeah.

10:56.434 --> 10:58.199
Don't worry, I won't get in your way.

11:38.568 --> 11:40.094
I'll see you at St
George's at four, yeah?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.957
- Yeah. Don't be late.
- Always on parade punctually.

11:44.933 --> 11:47.125
- Good luck. You're going to smash it.
- Thank you.

12:11.319 --> 12:12.881
Thank you for agreeing to meet me.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.296
No problem.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.959
I'm working at the MoD
today, anyway, so...

12:15.977 --> 12:17.442
It's good to put a face to a name.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.140
Georgie's spoken a lot about you.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.358
Well she's a... a vital
member of the section.

12:22.431 --> 12:24.384
Who now needs a rest
to get herself better.

12:26.609 --> 12:29.311
Look, you do understand
she's ill, don't you?

12:30.237 --> 12:31.913
I don't want her agreeing
to go back to work

12:31.913 --> 12:34.149
if all it's going to do
is worsen her condition.

12:34.639 --> 12:36.519
We understand her situation.

12:36.751 --> 12:39.454
She's constantly being assessed
by the Army psychiatric team.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.529
- Look, we have a duty of care...
- So do I, Captain James.

12:46.919 --> 12:48.288
How can I help?

12:50.081 --> 12:52.639
I'm here to make sure it's
Georgie the Army puts first.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.439
We're getting married and I don't...

12:57.505 --> 12:58.838
Well, we're getting married.

12:58.839 --> 13:00.679
My wife is a serving soldier.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.465
Who's suffering from PTSD?

13:04.574 --> 13:06.145
I only meant that marriages can work,

13:06.172 --> 13:07.937
even if one is in the
Army and away on tour.

13:07.959 --> 13:10.079
Georgie shouldn't be
contemplating going on tour.

13:10.119 --> 13:11.389
She needs complete rest.

13:11.605 --> 13:12.752
I think you and I both know

13:12.756 --> 13:14.439
it'll be her who decides
what to do and when.

13:14.492 --> 13:16.667
You shouldn't be putting
those ideas into her head.

13:18.505 --> 13:19.610
Look...

13:19.903 --> 13:22.368
I'm not just her commanding officer...

13:23.628 --> 13:25.879
I also genuinely care
what's best for her.

13:31.681 --> 13:33.399
Thank God you got her out of there.

13:35.396 --> 13:37.643
Special forces boys
did most of the work.

13:38.331 --> 13:39.738
I wish I could thank 'em.

13:43.303 --> 13:44.550
So, what, were they

13:44.830 --> 13:46.559
Kenyan or British or... ?

13:49.434 --> 13:50.921
What, are you not allowed to say?

14:10.403 --> 14:12.711
- Say goodbye to Daddy, Laura.
- Got to go to Mummy now.

14:12.911 --> 14:13.932
See you next week!

14:13.943 --> 14:15.514
- Say bye.
- Bye!

14:19.798 --> 14:21.707
Come on, off we go. Say bye-bye.

14:35.879 --> 14:37.417
Georgie!

14:38.061 --> 14:40.109
- What you doing here?
- Elvis, it don't matter now.

14:40.359 --> 14:42.451
- What did you want?
- I shouldn't have come.

14:44.493 --> 14:46.329
VOICE BREAKING: What am I doing?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.198
Hey.

14:58.515 --> 14:59.759
Talk to me.

15:04.439 --> 15:05.959
I'm imagining things.

15:13.559 --> 15:16.609
I'm seeing people that aren't there.

15:18.799 --> 15:20.519
Who do you think you've been seeing?

15:22.359 --> 15:24.505
Well, he's dead, so it can't be him.

15:24.679 --> 15:26.181
- Abu?
- Yeah.

15:28.879 --> 15:29.959
What?

15:31.175 --> 15:34.158
After the air strike, the Kenyans
went in to find DNA evidence,

15:34.533 --> 15:36.558
trying to identify
who'd been neutralised.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.550
But how could he survive?
The place got obliterated.

15:38.572 --> 15:40.254
That's the thing. They found
a very impressive network

15:40.276 --> 15:42.301
of tunnels underneath the dwelling.

15:43.056 --> 15:44.615
So he escaped?

15:45.064 --> 15:46.502
Really?! We let him escape?

15:46.535 --> 15:49.099
- We didn't let him escape.
- So he's smarter than the British Army?

15:49.937 --> 15:51.341
Oh, my God.

15:53.919 --> 15:56.759
Every time I close my
eyes at night, I see him.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.254
His face.

15:59.519 --> 16:01.999
And when I do manage to get
to sleep he's always there.

16:06.396 --> 16:07.817
- I'm losing it, aren't I?
- No, you're not.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.559
Well, he's not really
following me, is he?

16:09.609 --> 16:12.428
There is no way he has got
back into the UK. Trust me.

16:12.982 --> 16:15.790
- I will report the sightings but try to...
- So it's...

16:16.079 --> 16:17.919
- So it's all my imagination?
- Yeah.

16:26.599 --> 16:28.425
So he tried to kill you, didn't he?

16:30.062 --> 16:31.744
He killed a fellow hostage.

16:34.799 --> 16:37.359
It's natural that you feel
a bit shaken, anyone would.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.790
All right?

16:40.479 --> 16:42.299
- OK.
- Good.

16:48.879 --> 16:50.728
- I've got to go.
- Go on.

16:53.553 --> 16:55.500
- See you.
- See you later.

17:10.679 --> 17:13.917
INDISTINCT CHATTER

17:13.919 --> 17:16.282
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

17:17.398 --> 17:18.396
You smashed it.

17:18.559 --> 17:21.559
Oh, I haven't been that nervous
since I asked you to marry me.

17:21.679 --> 17:22.954
Judy!

17:26.094 --> 17:28.278
This is my partner, Georgie.

17:28.397 --> 17:30.730
- Hi.
- I've obviously heard all about you.

17:31.079 --> 17:32.678
Judy and I trained together.

17:32.798 --> 17:34.559
What an ordeal you've been through.

17:38.165 --> 17:39.918
Er, so you work here, then?

17:40.202 --> 17:42.478
She studied here, now
she's back tutoring.

17:42.689 --> 17:44.198
Can't keep me away.

17:44.460 --> 17:48.132
Sometimes Georgie tutors the
new recruits at Pirbright.

17:48.647 --> 17:51.630
Yeah, the thing with trainee
doctors is they listen,

17:51.799 --> 17:53.708
unlike the squaddies.

17:53.886 --> 17:55.648
Yeah, but you can make them listen

17:55.662 --> 17:57.988
or it's solitary
confinement and 50 lashes.

18:03.186 --> 18:04.989
Er, Judy invited us

18:05.047 --> 18:07.896
back for a little, er,
reception in the staffroom.

18:07.919 --> 18:09.214
Oh, nothing too grand.

18:09.215 --> 18:12.109
Finger buffet. Extended
to all guest speakers

18:12.327 --> 18:13.978
and their plus-ones, of course.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.084
I don't think I've ever made
it into the staff quarters.

18:23.661 --> 18:25.982
I'll, er, see you later, JJ.

18:35.879 --> 18:36.943
JJ?

18:37.999 --> 18:41.772
Oh, er... No, there were two
Jamies in the year, so I became JJ.

18:41.799 --> 18:43.250
Do you fancy a bit of finger buffet?

18:43.290 --> 18:44.924
You've never mentioned... erm...

18:45.044 --> 18:46.274
Judy?

18:46.354 --> 18:47.756
- PHONE BEEPS
- Haven't I?

18:49.433 --> 18:51.697
_

18:51.759 --> 18:53.770
- MAN: Great talk, Jamie.
- Thank you.

18:54.458 --> 18:55.488
What is it?

18:55.719 --> 18:57.659
You know my cousin who
lives in Belsize Park?

18:57.663 --> 18:59.661
- Yeah, what about her?
- Well, I said

18:59.670 --> 19:01.552
if I had time I'd nip
in for a brew, so...

19:01.614 --> 19:03.399
Well, I'll come with
you. No, no. No, no.

19:04.376 --> 19:05.774
- You've got Judy.
- No, a quick bite

19:05.794 --> 19:06.793
and we'll see her on the way home.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.475
I'd rather just meet you at Euston.

19:08.724 --> 19:11.519
Besides, I don't really
fancy a finger buffet.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.961
Sometimes I feel like
there's a part of you

19:14.970 --> 19:16.702
- I'm not allowed to know.
- Er, do you know...

19:16.728 --> 19:18.145
Just a second.

19:18.655 --> 19:20.351
I didn't know who Judy was.

19:35.397 --> 19:37.678
But surely they don't actually
think it's Abu, do they?

19:37.750 --> 19:40.285
Well, the MoD think there's a
chance he could be in the country.

19:41.679 --> 19:43.352
Just talk to them.

19:43.898 --> 19:45.963
Explain to the brigadier what
you may or may not have seen.

19:45.989 --> 19:48.097
If he's unaccounted for,
he's going to be desperate

19:48.102 --> 19:49.238
to glean as much as he can from you.

19:49.239 --> 19:50.486
But I don't even know it was him!

19:50.526 --> 19:52.630
Yes, but now they need
to make doubly sure that

19:52.644 --> 19:54.983
any intel you have is
shared with all agencies.

19:55.199 --> 19:57.399
Do they think he's planning
something on home soil?

20:01.349 --> 20:02.359
Yeah.

20:05.948 --> 20:07.786
They've been monitoring
the movements of the mother.

20:07.950 --> 20:11.270
In fact, his entire close family
are under 24-hour surveillance.

20:11.865 --> 20:13.073
As will you be.

20:18.079 --> 20:19.021
Relax.

20:19.971 --> 20:21.858
- Lance Corporal Lane.
- Sir.

20:23.585 --> 20:24.717
Right.

20:25.999 --> 20:27.546
Let's get started, shall we?

20:36.519 --> 20:37.333
Right.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.349
Right, well, I'm getting
a cab now, all right?

20:39.353 --> 20:40.365
OK, bye.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.908
You didn't go and see
your cousin, did you?

21:01.559 --> 21:03.447
Sorry. I just didn't
want you to be cross.

21:03.567 --> 21:04.872
So did you meet someone?

21:06.959 --> 21:08.680
Only the Army, yeah.

21:09.044 --> 21:11.599
- So you did meet someone?
- No! Not someone.

21:12.831 --> 21:15.799
Special forces who helped with my
rescue wanted to interview me again.

21:15.919 --> 21:17.781
Why couldn't they do it properly,

21:17.830 --> 21:18.922
professionally?

21:19.255 --> 21:21.466
What's all this cloak and dagger
coming to London to shop stuff?

21:21.479 --> 21:24.199
- I was coming to London to shop.
- Mm!

21:24.582 --> 21:26.566
Look, they called me and I met them.

21:31.599 --> 21:32.851
They're, erm...

21:36.141 --> 21:38.716
They're giving us close security

21:38.965 --> 21:40.710
for a few days. 24 hours.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.536
Close security?

21:45.735 --> 21:47.075
24 hours a day? Why?

21:47.076 --> 21:48.927
I can't give you any
details on the train, can I?

21:48.945 --> 21:51.333
- I'm going to be your husband!
- Yes, I know!

22:05.094 --> 22:06.999
You know I won't let
you down, don't you?

22:08.859 --> 22:10.479
We are getting married.

22:17.665 --> 22:18.999
You know, don't you?

22:20.319 --> 22:21.443
Know what?

22:24.520 --> 22:26.211
- Who told you?
- No-one.

22:28.595 --> 22:30.079
It was my mum, wasn't it?

22:30.199 --> 22:31.697
- My mum.
- All she said was some guy

22:31.706 --> 22:33.934
let you down on the day of
your wedding and he was Army but

22:33.983 --> 22:35.479
she didn't even tell me his name.

22:38.079 --> 22:39.305
What was his name?

22:39.425 --> 22:41.023
When we first started out,

22:41.294 --> 22:43.376
you said to me that you
didn't care about my past,

22:43.389 --> 22:44.686
only the future, right?

22:44.907 --> 22:47.149
- Yeah.
- Right, so...

22:48.287 --> 22:49.525
after that

22:50.262 --> 22:52.091
I just didn't know how
to bring it back up.

22:52.350 --> 22:53.499
You know?

22:55.168 --> 22:56.944
Anyway, he doesn't even enter my mind

22:56.948 --> 22:58.591
so it's just irrelevant,

22:58.649 --> 22:59.759
the whole thing.

23:07.084 --> 23:08.842
Just one thing from now on.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.703
One thing.

23:12.359 --> 23:13.721
Be honest with me.

23:15.093 --> 23:16.287
That's all.

23:23.221 --> 23:24.239
OK.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.355
Double lock the front door.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.534
If you could just let us know
of any planned movements...

23:33.592 --> 23:35.158
So you'll follow us everywhere?

23:35.159 --> 23:36.704
There'll always be someone outside

23:36.886 --> 23:38.743
and we'll just shadow you as
you go about your business.

23:38.863 --> 23:39.759
OK?

23:42.729 --> 23:44.132
It's so weird.

23:44.252 --> 23:45.282
What?

23:46.319 --> 23:48.399
The fact that he's out there
somewhere, looking for us.

23:48.408 --> 23:50.912
Well, we don't know he's
actually looking for us. Do we?

23:50.959 --> 23:52.723
It's freaking me out.

23:54.279 --> 23:55.814
Well, I'll look after you.

23:56.790 --> 23:58.839
Or close protection will look after you.

23:58.850 --> 24:01.079
THEY LAUGH

24:06.961 --> 24:08.745
I wish you could have
stayed for the reception.

24:09.597 --> 24:10.632
Why?

24:12.381 --> 24:14.479
They said I could go back
and tutor there and eventually

24:14.508 --> 24:16.168
work towards my professorship.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.814
What, they actually offered you a job?

24:19.862 --> 24:21.208
Offered for now. Yeah.

24:23.015 --> 24:24.498
Was it that Judy?

24:25.004 --> 24:26.797
- She's not "that" Judy...
- Well...

24:27.157 --> 24:29.314
She's, no... She works there, OK,

24:29.345 --> 24:31.174
it won't be her decision
but she can help.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.628
I don't...

24:36.125 --> 24:37.346
I don't know what to say.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.258
I don't have to give them a
definitive answer for 24 hours.

24:44.239 --> 24:45.531
But what about my job?

24:45.913 --> 24:47.720
You know, I'm a soldier.

24:48.732 --> 24:50.278
I'm a Manchester girl.

24:50.521 --> 24:53.959
Yeah, but you spend most
of your life somewhere else.

24:54.158 --> 24:56.936
Afghan, Sierra Leone, Germany, Kenya...

24:57.691 --> 24:58.959
why not London?

25:02.016 --> 25:03.853
We always talked about
it being your last tour

25:03.862 --> 25:05.074
before we got married.

25:06.188 --> 25:08.479
Maybe now is a good time to bow out.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.125
Leave the Army.

25:14.919 --> 25:16.076
I don't know... I...

25:16.125 --> 25:17.408
I don't know if I'm ready.

25:18.039 --> 25:20.271
Well, if we're going to have seven kids,

25:20.661 --> 25:22.959
we're going to have to start
banging them out soonish.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.039
Banging them out?!

25:25.118 --> 25:26.952
You make me sound like a beast.

25:36.439 --> 25:39.507
- I'm in attendance as your Army liason.
- Yes, I know, sir.

25:39.564 --> 25:41.514
Counter Terrorism
Command from here on in.

25:41.531 --> 25:43.383
- The big guns.
- Oh, yes.

25:43.405 --> 25:45.061
I'm here to look after
your best interests.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.398
- Sir.
- Good morning.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.838
How's life treating you, Lane?

25:50.522 --> 25:51.765
Fine.

25:53.532 --> 25:56.315
We all know it's not the
easiest to adjust after a tour.

25:57.336 --> 25:58.676
Yeah, well...

25:59.582 --> 26:00.900
If you ever need to talk...

26:07.399 --> 26:10.018
I've briefed them and they've
obviously read your file.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.732
If you ever don't understand anything,

26:11.750 --> 26:13.481
- just ask me and I'll clarify it.
- OK.

26:13.499 --> 26:14.774
- You got this?
- Yes.

26:14.787 --> 26:17.159
So, there's nothing for you
to be alarmed about, Lane...

26:17.184 --> 26:18.223
Sir.

26:18.387 --> 26:20.435
... but we now have confirmation

26:20.839 --> 26:24.262
Raynott re-entered the
country on August 28th.

26:25.984 --> 26:28.603
Arrived on a passenger
flight from Ethiopia.

26:31.319 --> 26:32.665
Why didn't we apprehend him?

26:32.847 --> 26:33.997
False passport.

26:35.039 --> 26:37.011
What, it's that simple, sir?

26:37.535 --> 26:38.719
Occasionally.

26:40.216 --> 26:42.598
Until he's apprehended
we assume he's active.

26:42.756 --> 26:44.657
Intelligence have now
led us to the cleric

26:44.679 --> 26:46.579
we think radicalised Raynott.

26:47.081 --> 26:49.354
Hassan al-Shwadify,

26:49.474 --> 26:51.685
originally Egyptian he's
been preaching in Manchester

26:51.694 --> 26:53.101
for the past seven years.

26:53.221 --> 26:54.929
Not at any of his known addresses,

26:54.938 --> 26:56.870
which leads us to contemplate

26:57.908 --> 27:00.545
he might be part of an
active cell with Raynott.

27:02.959 --> 27:04.999
We need you to stay calm and focused.

27:05.011 --> 27:07.200
So what you're saying is, right...

27:08.345 --> 27:09.797
that my... sightings of him

27:09.799 --> 27:11.639
might not have been delusions but it...

27:11.661 --> 27:13.059
it might have been him?

27:17.889 --> 27:19.247
So what do you...

27:19.660 --> 27:21.759
Do you think he might have
found out where I am and... ?

27:21.759 --> 27:23.007
We need you to plot all the places

27:23.025 --> 27:24.313
you think you may have seen him.

27:24.433 --> 27:26.342
Then we can trawl
through the CCTV footage

27:26.351 --> 27:27.656
and try and find him.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.359
We're going to catch him, Lane.

28:31.130 --> 28:33.776
So I came running out of
the shop, couldn't see him.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.338
Just thought it was a case of
- what d'you call it?

28:36.706 --> 28:38.269
- mistaken identity.

28:38.783 --> 28:41.030
Anyway, I saw this guy,
I just grabbed him and

28:41.039 --> 28:42.210
it wasn't Abu.

28:42.530 --> 28:43.946
Was Abu alone?

28:44.244 --> 28:46.223
Er, yeah. Yeah,

28:46.947 --> 28:48.900
if it was even him, yeah.

28:50.606 --> 28:53.225
Actually, no. What am I
talking about? I don't know.

28:53.345 --> 28:54.584
I don't know.

28:54.881 --> 28:58.206
He might or he might not
have been alone. I'm sorry.

29:01.113 --> 29:02.906
We'll go and check the CCTV.

29:02.933 --> 29:03.954
OK.

29:07.599 --> 29:08.739
You all right?

29:09.360 --> 29:10.306
Yeah.

29:10.785 --> 29:12.907
Don't worry, I'll be ready for Syria.

29:15.439 --> 29:17.086
- What?
- Well,

29:17.747 --> 29:19.336
let's see how all this pans out.

29:20.202 --> 29:21.334
I'm fine.

29:22.164 --> 29:23.393
You need to rest,

29:23.882 --> 29:25.125
get yourself 100% sorted

29:25.133 --> 29:26.910
and then we can think about Syria.

29:27.971 --> 29:29.081
You're a bloody good soldier

29:29.094 --> 29:30.479

of shit chucked at you.

30:19.831 --> 30:21.506
I wasn't just imagining it.

30:24.639 --> 30:26.429
Having studied the files

30:26.490 --> 30:29.237
and watched the tapes of
your debrief in Kenya, Lane...

30:29.357 --> 30:31.495
you seemed certain his planned attack

30:31.517 --> 30:32.910
was Kenya, not home soil.

30:32.927 --> 30:35.590
I think I just presumed it,
sir. It was nothing concrete.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.354
In your statement, Lane, you said,

30:38.887 --> 30:40.806
"I didn't have long in their ops room

30:40.834 --> 30:43.436
but there were these drawings, sketches.

I think they showed the
entrance to a shopping centre

30:46.378 --> 30:49.081

sculpture like a bird."

escalated to severe.

this, you dirty stop-out?

Sorry,

31:21.005 --> 31:22.517
I was worried.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.101

part of the counterterrorism op

a very good job, did you?

44:26.323 --> 44:28.043
PEOPLE CHATTER

44:39.781 --> 44:40.852
That's him.

44:40.863 --> 44:42.999
Let's get on to the bus
company and ground all buses.

44:43.032 --> 44:44.442
Respectfully, that's
going to take too long.

44:44.483 --> 44:46.029
Permission to move now, sir.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.015
Go!

45:00.043 --> 45:02.220
PEOPLE CHATTER

45:08.586 --> 45:12.237
Armed police! Show me your
hands! Show me your hands!

45:19.929 --> 45:22.302
Suspect down. Detonator neutralised.

45:22.422 --> 45:24.723
- Nobody move!
- Are you alone?

45:29.003 --> 45:31.853
Bravo One Zero, this
is Sierra Three Alpha.

45:31.854 --> 45:34.503
We have overwatch. Over.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.853
Marie, it's me, I need you
to call me back, all right?

45:51.862 --> 45:53.185
I need you to come home.

46:02.323 --> 46:04.739
Here we go. Prepare to breach.

46:17.306 --> 46:18.943
DOOR BEEPS

46:22.476 --> 46:24.768
- I thought you were up town.
- No, I can't get a bus.

46:24.784 --> 46:26.915
- Good, stay in.
- Why?

46:26.943 --> 46:28.974
Cos there's loads of shit going down.

46:41.881 --> 46:44.736
- All call signs on me now.
- <i>Roger.</i>

46:44.752 --> 46:46.450
Where the hell's Lulu?

46:47.004 --> 46:50.473
Lulu, come down. Let Georgie
see you're still alive.

47:11.633 --> 47:13.376
Spanner, top deck.

47:33.131 --> 47:34.492
My love, under your
seat there's a rucksack,

47:34.503 --> 47:35.762
can you tell me if it's yours, please?

47:35.938 --> 47:37.863
Rucksack? With my back?

47:37.895 --> 47:39.417
Right, OK. I need everyone's attention.

47:39.421 --> 47:41.878
Can everybody slowly make their way
off the front of the bus, please?

47:41.923 --> 47:43.483
Soon as possible. Thank you.

47:48.578 --> 47:51.117
That's it. Keep moving. Down you go.

47:51.123 --> 47:54.770
Medium-sized rucksack
found under seat 24.

47:54.890 --> 47:57.100
Human lives threatened
and collateral damage.

48:02.535 --> 48:04.075
Remote device confirmed.

48:04.098 --> 48:05.136
We need to block the signal.

48:05.154 --> 48:06.854
OK. That's a remote device confirmed.

48:06.868 --> 48:09.269
Repeat, remote device confirmed.
Block all signals. Over.

48:09.300 --> 48:11.241
<i>Roger. All signals blocked. Over.</i>

48:11.818 --> 48:13.904
Let's scramble a helicopter,
the target's on the move.

48:25.007 --> 48:26.250
Evacuate immediate area.

48:26.255 --> 48:27.529
I want a 100-yard exclusion zone.

48:27.551 --> 48:29.083
Get everybody out of
their cars and away now.

48:29.105 --> 48:30.304
- Roger.
- Go.

49:12.831 --> 49:14.367
EXPLOSION

49:17.518 --> 49:18.819
FAINTLY: What was that?

49:19.428 --> 49:21.061
Georgie, what was that?

49:22.668 --> 49:23.883
Georgie, what was it?

49:23.916 --> 49:25.537
<i>TV: We have received information
that a man has detonated</i>

49:25.563 --> 49:28.123
<i>an explosive vest on George Street... </i>

49:28.200 --> 49:31.361
<i>It does appear that there may
have been several incidents.</i>

49:31.387 --> 49:34.455
<i>Talking about a device
being found on a bus</i>

49:34.575 --> 49:36.036
which was stopped outside...

49:36.081 --> 49:37.013
Fled the bus

49:37.026 --> 49:38.425
- so we are led to assume
- _

49:38.429 --> 49:40.249
<i> that this man is still at large.</i>

49:40.283 --> 49:41.803
KNOCK AT THE WINDOW

49:49.007 --> 49:50.388
I've been reading about it online.

49:50.392 --> 49:51.617
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:51.737 --> 49:53.437
- Any fatalities?
- One

49:53.894 --> 49:55.310
plus the suicide bomber.

49:55.430 --> 49:58.014
- Abu?
- No, one of his associates.

49:58.538 --> 50:00.158
You were spot-on about Abu, though.

50:00.637 --> 50:01.578
How?

50:01.609 --> 50:03.039
He tried to bomb the shopping centre.

50:03.159 --> 50:04.992
Along with another suspect
who's now been arrested.

50:05.019 --> 50:06.239
A bloke called Naazir.

50:06.266 --> 50:08.123
Right, well, what about
Abu, have you got him?

50:16.618 --> 50:18.069
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not having this.

50:18.078 --> 50:19.174
- You need to go, Elvis.
- Mum...

50:19.188 --> 50:21.096
- Grace, it's not what it looks like.
- No, I don't want to hear it!

50:21.216 --> 50:23.077
You need to go and you
need to leave us alone.

50:23.094 --> 50:24.718
- I can appreciate...
- I don't want to hear it!

50:24.727 --> 50:26.161
I don't want to hear it!

50:31.857 --> 50:34.654
I'm just thinking of you,
Georgie, so I don't need the evils.

50:53.530 --> 50:54.631
So what happened?

50:57.344 --> 51:00.157
His accomplice had to detonate
his vest out in the open.

51:01.289 --> 51:02.874
If Abu had got in that
shopping centre, trust me,

51:02.888 --> 51:04.317
it would have been carnage.

51:04.437 --> 51:06.905
- So you let him go.
- We didn't let him go, he disappeared!

51:07.474 --> 51:08.983
We found his explosive device on the bus

51:09.006 --> 51:10.382
but he was nowhere to be seen.

51:20.196 --> 51:21.323
So what now?

51:32.397 --> 51:34.240
Come on, you did a good thing today.

51:36.495 --> 51:38.191
It was a waste of time, wasn't it?

51:38.271 --> 51:40.392
You let him slip through
your fingers. Again.

51:41.427 --> 51:43.105
Georgie! Georgie!

51:43.154 --> 51:44.406
Listen to me.

51:44.677 --> 51:45.786
Please.

51:49.533 --> 51:50.989
I do love you, you know.

51:51.291 --> 51:53.583
Elvis, I can't be happy with
you again. It's too late!

51:53.624 --> 51:55.491
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is, Elvis.

51:55.513 --> 51:57.719
OK, once upon a time...

51:59.042 --> 52:01.306
But no, not now.

52:01.488 --> 52:04.520
- Georgie, don't go.
- Elvis, please!

52:43.147 --> 52:44.740
I didn't go to London.

52:44.860 --> 52:46.627
Got called back to the hospital.

52:56.097 --> 52:58.566
I was so scared, not
knowing if you were OK.

53:03.524 --> 53:05.735
I thought you'd never
want to see me again.

53:16.584 --> 53:18.344
Can I ask you one question?

53:20.668 --> 53:21.805
Yeah.

53:23.962 --> 53:26.342
Is it properly over
between you and Elvis?

53:29.344 --> 53:31.051
Yeah, I promise.

53:31.171 --> 53:33.200
And nothing happened in Kenya?

53:38.000 --> 53:39.220
No.

53:50.277 --> 53:51.944
I'm leaving the Army.

53:55.418 --> 53:56.864
I've made up my mind.

53:58.658 --> 54:00.624
You have to do what you want to do.

54:03.550 --> 54:05.521
All I want to do...

54:06.844 --> 54:07.984
is marry you.

55:14.824 --> 55:16.623
CHEERING

55:16.624 --> 55:19.278
She's leaving the Army
and starting a new life.

55:19.398 --> 55:20.454
Back off.

55:20.472 --> 55:22.958
- Big day Saturday then.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's not a secret.

55:23.078 --> 55:25.511
Well, how about you tell me
who you really just met up with?

55:25.586 --> 55:27.091
KNOCK AT DOOR

55:27.362 --> 55:29.644
It's not like you to
turn up on my wedding day.

55:29.959 --> 55:31.388
It's too dangerous.

55:31.561 --> 55:33.217
Abu is out there somewhere.

55:33.224 --> 55:35.491
With a vest... I'll be in control.

55:35.762 --> 55:37.018
Do you think he knows about the wedding?

55:37.040 --> 55:39.095
Think about it, Georgie. It's
the first day of your new life,

55:39.100 --> 55:40.223
you don't think he'd want to ruin that?

55:43.024 --> 55:45.607
Find Abu and neutralise him.
