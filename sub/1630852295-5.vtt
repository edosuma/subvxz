Shhhhh!

01:17.004 --> 01:18.004
Aha!

01:18.006 --> 01:20.002
Shh!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.007
Shh!

02:23.021 --> 02:25.021
Aah!

02:38.018 --> 02:39.022
Shh!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.017
Shhh!

06:48.008 --> 06:49.021
Phew!

09:49.011 --> 09:51.011
Alright!
The door's finally fixed

09:51.013 --> 09:52.023
so we can finally talk again.

09:53.001 --> 09:58.017
Shh!

09:58.019 --> 10:02.010
Come on, Oscar. Who needs
these killjoys anyways?

10:02.012 --> 10:04.011
We can have all kinds of fun
on our own,

10:04.013 --> 10:05.022
just the two of us.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.020
Let those squares
have their dumb library.

10:08.022 --> 10:11.021
Look I get it --
Rules are rules, right?

10:11.023 --> 10:13.016
No! Wrong!

10:13.018 --> 10:15.007
Rules are made
to help people,

10:15.009 --> 10:18.000
and sometimes people need
to yell in the library,

10:18.002 --> 10:20.001
or they need to dance
at the bank

10:20.003 --> 10:21.010
or the grocery store.

10:21.012 --> 10:24.020
Not every day, but maybe
just once in your life.

10:24.022 --> 10:27.015
If you let yourself be real,
even just that once,

10:27.017 --> 10:30.015
when you're young,
you get a lifetime of peace,

10:30.017 --> 10:33.004
'cause every time
some kid gets excited

10:33.006 --> 10:34.023
about getting
the goo goo berries

10:35.001 --> 10:36.010
for the door-repair potion,

10:36.012 --> 10:39.005
and he just has to shout,
and get the excitement out

10:39.007 --> 10:41.007
so it can breathe and live,

10:41.009 --> 10:42.023
every time that happens,
you'll think,

10:43.001 --> 10:45.016
"Oh, yeah. I felt that way once,
when I was a kid.

10:45.018 --> 10:46.020
I had to shout, too.

10:46.022 --> 10:49.008
And I'm a nice guy or gal
or person,

10:49.010 --> 10:51.006
so maybe he's a nice guy, too,

10:51.008 --> 10:53.008
even though he yelled
in the library."

10:53.010 --> 10:57.003
But not these guys.
They just hate being reminded

10:57.005 --> 10:59.020
about how much they're babying
their way through life,

10:59.022 --> 11:01.016
too scared to break a rule.

11:01.018 --> 11:03.013
Well, who needs 'em, Oscar?

11:03.015 --> 11:05.005
Who needs 'em?
