Okay, you guys,
the Yanks are here.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.802
(male #1)
'Don't go!
It's a Jap trick!'

03:21.869 --> 03:24.505
Come on! You've been
here three years!

03:24.572 --> 03:26.840
Head for the main gate.

03:29.777 --> 03:30.811
Yanks!

03:30.878 --> 03:31.878
Take him.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.714
Come on, guys!

03:33.781 --> 03:36.817
(male #2)
'Come on, fellas,
get to the main gate.'

03:36.884 --> 03:39.320
Get to the main gate,
boys. Come on.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.654
Come on, boys.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.890
Hurry up. Come on,
fellas. The main gate.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.525
Come on, the main gate.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.160
Get to the main gate.
Come on, right this way.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.996
Come on, boys.
Get to the main gate.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.499
Get to the main gate,

[indistinct]

04:15.055 --> 04:16.790
Come on, men.
Hurry it up.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.959
Keep moving, men.
Hurry it up. Come on.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.995
Hurry it up.
Come on.

04:22.062 --> 04:25.065
We'll send a man back as
soon as we're in the clear.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.768
Okay, captain. We'll
take care of them for you.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.344
Come on, give that man
a hand, will you?

04:54.462 --> 04:57.331
[distant chattering]

04:58.131 --> 05:01.335
[chattering continues]

05:07.408 --> 05:09.410

'Banzai!'

05:11.445 --> 05:12.980
(male #3)
Banzai!

05:13.046 --> 05:14.782
-'Banzai!'
- 'Banzai!'

05:21.455 --> 05:22.923
Banzai!

05:24.525 --> 05:26.059
- Banzai!
- 'Banzai!'

(male #3)
'Banzai!'

05:31.031 --> 05:34.034
[gunshots]

05:44.845 --> 05:46.980
Well, that's the first round.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.882
They'll be back.

[engine revving]

05:57.290 --> 05:59.593
[blast]

05:59.660 --> 06:00.928
- Captain.
- Yeah.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.830
It's all clear.
You can withdraw now.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.565
- Good. Jack!
- Yes, sir?

06:04.632 --> 06:07.334
We're pulling out.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.802
Come on.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.604
[blast]

06:15.676 --> 06:19.580
* California, here I come *

06:19.647 --> 06:23.684
* Right back where
I started from *

06:23.751 --> 06:27.721
* Where bowers of flowers
bloom in the sun *

06:27.788 --> 06:30.991
(male narrator)
The men you are about to see
are actual survivors

06:31.058 --> 06:33.994
of three terrible years
in the Jap prison camp

06:34.061 --> 06:35.596
at Cabanatuan.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.858
(woman on radio)
'For two weeks,
Filipino troops'

07:37.925 --> 07:40.728
'have held their front
in Bataan without relief.'

07:40.794 --> 07:42.830
'And for ten days
and ten nights'

07:42.896 --> 07:44.896
'they have been withstanding
the unceasing attacks'

07:44.932 --> 07:47.067
'of General Homma's
200,000 men.'

07:47.134 --> 07:48.769
Don't we know it.

07:48.836 --> 07:52.439
'Why do you fight?
This is not your war.'

07:52.506 --> 07:54.474
'America brought you into it.'

07:54.542 --> 07:56.910
'For every American
who dies in Bataan'

07:56.977 --> 07:59.547
'seven Filipinos
shed their blood.'

07:59.613 --> 08:01.582
'Americahas abandoned you.'

08:01.649 --> 08:04.652
General, what do you think
our chances are that..

08:04.718 --> 08:07.955
That help is on its way?
Nothing we can bet on.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.624
'What good is liberty
to the dead?'

08:10.691 --> 08:12.259
'Filipinos'

08:12.325 --> 08:14.027
why do you fight?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.029
Look toward the sea.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.531
Your liberators come

08:17.598 --> 08:20.267
to restore your homes
and your loved ones.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.937
'Filipinos, look
toward the sea.'

08:24.004 --> 08:25.673
Scotty.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.708
Any word of a concentration
on our left?

08:27.775 --> 08:29.242
No, sir. Nothing
to indicate one.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.679
But we have time for aerial
reconnaissance before dark.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.782
Yes, we got time alright,
but no air corps.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.784
It burned out a bearing.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.986
- Get Colonel Madden.
- Yes, sir.

08:40.621 --> 08:44.491
(woman on radio)
'Filipinos, why are you
rotting in foxholes?'

08:44.558 --> 08:46.193
'You have no arms.'

08:46.259 --> 08:48.195
'You're dying by the thousands
of malaria.'

08:48.261 --> 08:49.763
'Your homes are
being destroyed.'

08:49.830 --> 08:52.766
Colonel Madden.
Headquarters on the phone.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.102
'Spare your homeland.'

08:57.571 --> 08:59.940
Colonel Madden speaking.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.910
They're attacking about every
hour, sir...as usual.

09:02.976 --> 09:07.214
Joe, something may be pulled
against your end of the line.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.883
Put that company of Philippine
scouts on alert

09:09.950 --> 09:11.885
but don't commit them to action

09:11.952 --> 09:13.954
unless the situation
becomes desperate.

09:14.021 --> 09:17.224
- 'Well, what's up, sir?'
- I wish I knew, Joe.

09:22.462 --> 09:26.133
- Where's Captain Bonifacio?
- He went to the cliffs, sir.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.801
- Colonel, sir.
- Yes.

09:27.868 --> 09:32.005
That woman on the radio,
she was his sweetheart, sir.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.373
I know.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.008
- Roberts.
- Yes, sir.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.678
I'm going up the cliffs.
I'll be gone ten minutes.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.780
- Take over.
- Yes, sir.

09:50.624 --> 09:54.061
- Hello, Andres.
- Oh.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.495
Hi.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.999
- Just passing by, I suppose.
- No, I want to talk to you.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.269
Oh, won't you make
yourself at home?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.336
Cigarette?

10:03.403 --> 10:04.905
Thanks.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.940
I'm sorry, I can't
offer you anything better

10:07.007 --> 10:09.142
than these crude
native cigarettes.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.577
That's alright.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.846
I've been smoking them
for years.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.183
- Find them to my taste.
- Good.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.252
You'll forgive me if I don't
pour you a martini. You see--

10:19.319 --> 10:21.922
- Stop acting like a schoolboy.
- What do you mean schoolboy?

10:21.989 --> 10:23.824
Only a schoolboy
would expose his men

10:23.891 --> 10:25.492
like you did this morning.

10:25.558 --> 10:29.162
I know it's tough when the woman
you love goes over to the enemy.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.598
- But you can't let her--
- That's none of your business.

10:31.665 --> 10:35.035
That's right. But risking these
men's lives is my business.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.871
Keep it up and you'll have
the whole company wiped out.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.506
This is a dirty war
we're fighting.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.776
- We gotta fight it right.
- What do you want me to do?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.344
Act like a soldier.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.847
Remember, you're in command
of a company of men.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.850
You've got the responsibility
of their lives in your hands.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.819
What is it, Bernessa?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.821
Major McKinley
third battalion reports

10:53.887 --> 10:56.757
Japs are making
mass attack, sir.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.492
Get back to your company.
Hold them on the alert.

10:59.559 --> 11:02.562
And don't do anything until you
get orders, understand?

11:02.629 --> 11:04.698
Yes, sir.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.500
By the way, for
this morning's action

11:07.567 --> 11:10.103
I'm recommending you
for the DSC.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.610
- Colonel, sir.
- Yes, Bernessa?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.947
Captain Bonifacio,
how is it with him, sir?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.549
Okay. We'll have to
keep an eye on him.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.615
Yes, sir.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.286
[airplane approaching]

11:26.353 --> 11:28.255
[gunshots]

11:42.635 --> 11:44.571
Get McKinley on a wire.

11:44.637 --> 11:45.973
[explosion]

11:46.039 --> 11:48.208
How much ammunition
do they think we've got?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.710
(McKinley)
'Major McKinley speaking.'

11:50.778 --> 11:52.212
Madden speaking.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.714
What are you guys celebrating
down there, New Year's?

11:54.782 --> 11:56.716
That's real ammunition
you're shooting.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.518
'That's real Japs
we're shooting at, sir.'

11:58.585 --> 12:02.089
At this rate, you'll use up our
nine-day supply in two hours.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.658
'They're not coming at the usual
rate. They're coming in waves.'

12:05.725 --> 12:07.527
McKinley, there aren't
that many Japs.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.397
'Sir, I suggest you come down
and see for yourself.'

12:10.463 --> 12:11.464
[click]

12:11.531 --> 12:13.266
[explosion]

12:13.333 --> 12:15.602
- Take over, Roberts.
- Yes, sir.

12:15.668 --> 12:18.205
I am going to see for myself.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
[explosion]

12:43.130 --> 12:44.264
[blasts]

12:44.331 --> 12:46.433
[gunshots]

12:54.107 --> 12:56.176
See what I mean, sir?

13:03.650 --> 13:06.854
[gunshots]

13:14.627 --> 13:17.197
[blasts]

13:17.264 --> 13:20.300
They're actually bridging that
barbed wire with their bodies.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.371
A bridge of dead.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.772
- Are you alright, sir?
- I'm alright.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.109
Didn't know there
were that many Japs.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.444
- Where's McKinley?
- Second one got him, sir.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.079
[blast]

14:07.147 --> 14:09.349
Let's get out of here!

14:20.961 --> 14:23.263
[insects chirping]

14:37.744 --> 14:40.113
- How goes it, Felipe?
- Okay, colonel, sir.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.681
(woman on loudspeaker)
'Filipinos.'

14:41.748 --> 14:43.951
'This is your countrywoman,
Dalisay Delgado'

14:44.017 --> 14:45.285
'speaking to you.'

14:45.352 --> 14:47.687
'I speak to you
from my heart.'

14:47.754 --> 14:50.690
'Must America have the last
drop of your blood?'

14:50.757 --> 14:52.425
'Lay down your guns.'

14:52.492 --> 14:56.696
'The empire of Japan is waiting
to welcome you in a Japanese--'

14:56.763 --> 14:58.165
- Take it easy!
- But--

14:58.231 --> 15:00.667
We haven't got ammunition
to waste on loudspeakers.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.269
Get down.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.272
'Peace, prosperity
and freedom await you'

15:05.338 --> 15:07.474
'as soon asthis war ends.'

15:07.540 --> 15:08.976
'You must not fight.'

15:09.042 --> 15:11.878
'The odds are against you.'

15:11.945 --> 15:14.081
'The Japanese have
more men than..'

15:14.147 --> 15:16.583
- Hello, Carlito.
- Hello, colonel.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.555
- How's the army?
- Okay, colonel, sir.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.825
Take good care of it. I'm
keeping an eye on your guitar.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.961
Thank you, sir.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.266
'Filipinos, there is no honor
in this fight.'

15:33.333 --> 15:36.436
What do they call the DSC you're
getting for today's action?

15:36.503 --> 15:39.539
I'll trade that medal for one
shot at the loudspeaker.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.874
No deal. Can't always
do what we like.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.743
I got orders to report
to Corregidor.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.278
- What for?
- I don't know.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.514
I'm to turn over my command
to Colonel Roberts.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.383
- Can I go with you?
- We lost McKinley today.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.285
You'll take over his battalion.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.121
[blast]

15:56.956 --> 15:58.691
'We must work with them.'

15:58.758 --> 16:01.428
'We must show that we're
worthy of their help.'

16:01.494 --> 16:04.497
'We must stop this
senseless war once..'

16:04.564 --> 16:06.633
[blasts]

16:07.634 --> 16:09.136
Hi, colonel.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.438
- Did the chow get here?
- Yes, sir, colonel.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.206
Good.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.176
Andres

16:16.243 --> 16:21.114
I, uh...I know every man in
this outfit by his first name.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.116
I've known them
since they were kids.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.318
Don't worry about them, colonel.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.690
'You have your lives
and your honor.'

16:30.757 --> 16:32.859
'Lay down your arms.'

16:32.925 --> 16:35.162
[gunshots]

16:35.228 --> 16:38.431
[announcement stops]

16:50.009 --> 16:51.811
Colonel Madden reporting, sir.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.780
Colonel.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.484
Hello, Joe.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.319
Hello, Skinny.
It's good to see you.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.587
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.289
We're going to make fast talk.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.325
Where's, uh, General MacArthur?

17:05.392 --> 17:08.295
How are things going at your
end of the line, Joe?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.430
We could use a little more food.

17:10.497 --> 17:14.032
We're running out of horses
and mules, but we'll get by.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.569
Sure, you will.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.570
[blast]

17:25.744 --> 17:26.813
American.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.815
The last.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.621
[blasts]

17:50.137 --> 17:53.573
You're building me up
for something, Skinny.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.308
Let's have it.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.611
- You're going out, Joe.
- Where?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.148
To organize general
guerrilla resistance.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.383
And leave my scouts?

18:03.450 --> 18:06.653
You can't do that to me, Skinny.
I've spent most of my life--

18:06.719 --> 18:11.791
Joe, the President just ordered
General MacArthur to Australia.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.060
Oh.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.664
[blasts]

18:17.730 --> 18:20.400
Well, then I guess
I can leave the scouts.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.703
I don't have to tell you

18:23.770 --> 18:25.838
what the boys of Bataan
have gone through.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.940
They've been bothered
especially with planes.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.577
They've pinned us down
until we're helpless.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.713
We've been combing them
out of our hair. We're..

18:33.780 --> 18:36.149
Anything you can do to
relieve the pressure, Joe.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.784
We'll do the best we can.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.487
- Haven't got much time.
- What about men?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.489
Well, you'll have
to take potluck.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.558
There are a few men in the hills
already scattering of scouts

18:45.625 --> 18:47.927
and Philippine troops
that have been cut off

18:47.994 --> 18:52.131
ROTC boys we couldn't equip
and a few civilians.

18:52.199 --> 18:55.034
Here's a map reference
to a small group

18:55.101 --> 18:57.370
near the town of Balintawak.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.372
You'll leave by PT boat
at midnight.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.642
That doesn't give me time
to get back to my men, does it?

19:02.709 --> 19:05.178
- No, it doesn't.
- I have my sergeant with me--

19:05.245 --> 19:07.079
Sure. Take him along.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.349
And, uh...one thing more.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.054
You'll have a source
of information

19:15.121 --> 19:16.889
you have to guard at all costs.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.891
It covers over Radio Manila.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.059
Radio Manila?

19:20.126 --> 19:22.495
Yes, it's the girl
Dalisay Delgado.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.398
Oh, yes, I know the stuff
she's broadcast is poison

19:25.465 --> 19:27.434
but it would've gone
on the air anyhow.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.669
She's doing more harm
than the Jap guns.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.736
Harm?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.004
It was a tip from her

19:32.071 --> 19:34.841
that kept your reserve company
of scouts out of action

19:34.907 --> 19:36.309
that saved the whole front.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.546
Last night, she warned us
about Yamashita's arrival.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.615
Well, that'll be good news
to...to a friend of hers.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.783
Uh, Joe.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.219
Nobody knows anything
about this except you and me

19:46.286 --> 19:48.221
now that General
MacArthur's gone.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.022
- It'll have to stop there.
- Yes, sir.

19:50.089 --> 19:53.493
The way to make contact with her
is set out in your orders.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.695
It's vital that
the guerrilla movement

19:55.762 --> 19:58.598
be organized in case..

19:58.665 --> 20:01.634
You won't have any trouble.
They're a great people.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.470
They are, sir.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.905
- So long.
- So long, Skinny.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.778
Be seeing you.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.714
To His Excellency, General Homma

20:14.781 --> 20:16.816
soon to be conqueror of Bataan.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.084
Thank you.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.886
If the Chief of Intelligence

20:19.952 --> 20:23.089
can spare his beautiful
companion for a moment

20:23.155 --> 20:25.425
I will talk with her.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.869
I have heard you
on the radio, Miss Delgado.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.406
I am deeply impressed
by your good sense.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.173
Thank you, Your Excellency.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.842
You may be the instrument

20:42.909 --> 20:45.745
of sparing your people
much unpleasantness.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.014
I have worked hard for that end.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.849
You must continue.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.051
The liberation of
the entire Philippines

20:52.118 --> 20:54.053
is now merely a matter of days.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.522
Let us hope so.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.658
In all confidence, Miss Delgado

20:58.725 --> 21:01.361
we Japanese look
upon you Filipinos

21:01.428 --> 21:04.964
as nephews and nieces.

21:05.031 --> 21:09.035
You have been out of our
East Asia family for too long.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.870
'We are waiting to embrace you'

21:10.937 --> 21:13.940
'to welcome you back
into the fold'

21:14.006 --> 21:16.809
'providing you
behave yourselves.'

21:16.876 --> 21:19.912
We shall be very good,
Your Excellency.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.515
I'm certain you will.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.952
But remember, we are kindly

21:26.018 --> 21:28.120
but not indulgent.

21:28.187 --> 21:30.122
We shall not hesitate

21:30.189 --> 21:33.326
to spank the unruly ones.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.896
Thank you, Miss Delgado.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.338
[birds chirping]

22:04.891 --> 22:08.327
The third or American
period of occupation

22:08.395 --> 22:10.530
began with the
Battle of Manila Bay

22:10.597 --> 22:12.399
and will be terminated

22:12.465 --> 22:17.637
by a grant of independence,
July 4, 1946.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.640
'These are the main phases
of our history.'

22:20.707 --> 22:22.575
'What, then, was Spain's
contribution'

22:22.642 --> 22:24.310
'to the Philippines?'

22:24.377 --> 22:25.578
'Maria?'

22:26.713 --> 22:28.981
The Spanish brought us
the holy faith

22:29.048 --> 22:31.283
the Blessed Virgin,
and the saints.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.585
Quite right, Maria.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.754
The Spaniards brought
us Christianity.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.657
And now, what would you say
America gave the Philippines?

22:37.724 --> 22:39.158
- Soda pop.
- Hot dogs.

22:39.225 --> 22:40.393
- Movies.
- Radio.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.928
Baseball.

22:43.930 --> 22:46.065
Perhaps the first of my pupils

22:46.132 --> 22:48.067
has a better answer.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.069
Señor Bello.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.306
America told us
that men are free

22:54.373 --> 22:55.908
or they are nothing.

22:55.975 --> 23:00.346
Since then, we have walked
with high heads among all men.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.948
Thank you, Señor Bello.

23:02.014 --> 23:05.217
But at first, the Filipinos
did not feel that way.

23:05.284 --> 23:07.353
They resisted
the American occupation.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.456
And then what happened? Theresa?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.390
- We were beaten.
- We were not.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.292
Americans cannot beat Filipinos.

23:13.359 --> 23:16.963
My brother Ramon licked
every American in the USA

23:17.029 --> 23:18.631
at a 118 pounds.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.367
Facts, Maximo.
We must stick to facts.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.835
I seem to recall

23:22.902 --> 23:25.271
that Ramone lost his fight
for the championship.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.973
We was robbed.

23:28.508 --> 23:31.811
Perhaps I should ask you about
a Filipino who was not beaten.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.346
What were the last words
of General Del Pillar

23:34.413 --> 23:37.249
to those who left him behind?

23:37.316 --> 23:38.718
I..

23:40.487 --> 23:41.854
I am..

23:41.921 --> 23:45.692
(Bello)
'I am surrounded
by fearful odds'

23:45.758 --> 23:50.563
that will overcome me
and my gallant men.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.065
But I am well pleased
with the thought

23:53.132 --> 23:56.503
that I die fighting
for my beloved country.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.239
Go you into the hills

24:00.306 --> 24:02.241
and defend it to the death.

24:02.308 --> 24:04.711
[cheering]

24:08.314 --> 24:10.650
[silence]

24:15.354 --> 24:17.557
[birds chirping]

24:27.266 --> 24:30.036
Is, uh...this everybody?

24:30.102 --> 24:31.270
Yes, sir.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.873
[speaking Tagalog]

24:36.175 --> 24:39.045
I was told I'd find some
Philippine scouts among you.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.014
Corporal Cruz, 26th Cavalry

24:42.081 --> 24:44.183
Philippine scouts,
reporting, sir.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.653
Good, Corporal.
Anyone else?

24:48.320 --> 24:52.158
- Where are you men from?
- Mostly from Balintawak, sir.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.226
Ever handle guns?

24:56.395 --> 24:58.297
Just bolos, eh?

24:58.364 --> 25:00.299
Our fathers used them well, sir.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.902
How well I know.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.337
I guess you understand
we're taking on a job

25:05.404 --> 25:07.740
that would be tough
for trained men.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.742
We're gonna blow up
a gasoline dump

25:09.809 --> 25:13.279
on a Japanese airfield 50 miles
the other side of Balintawak.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.415
There will be four to five
hundred Japs on the field.

25:16.482 --> 25:17.584
How many?

25:17.650 --> 25:19.451
(Joe)
'Four or five hundred.'

25:19.518 --> 25:21.588
Four or five hund..

25:24.791 --> 25:27.259
A mere trifle, like we say.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.761
We'll start tonight after dark

25:28.828 --> 25:31.631
that oughta put us at the
airfield by dark tomorrow night.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.199
Between now and sundown

25:33.265 --> 25:36.135
Sergeant Bernessa will
give you instructions.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.438
Listen to him carefully
and do exactly as he says.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.173
Take over, Sergeant.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.975
Yes, sir.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.586
Things look rough, huh?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.055
A little rough.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.592
In that case, smell this stew.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.097
Go ahead. Smell it.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.836
Ever smell anything better
than that in your life?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.004
Never.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.340
In that case, taste it.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.785
Why, it's a masterpiece, Bindle.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.020
You taste there the fruits
of two days panhandling

26:28.087 --> 26:31.023
all of which goes to prove
that nothing is wasted.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.627
People could look at me and say,
"Bindle Jackson, hobo."

26:34.694 --> 26:36.663
But without 20 years
experience on the road

26:36.729 --> 26:38.898
could I make up
a mulligan like that?

26:38.965 --> 26:40.166
Never.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.234
If I could only shoot.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.076
Colonel

26:50.142 --> 26:53.045
strictly from a point of view
of scientific curiosity

26:53.112 --> 26:55.782
what would you say
our chances are?

26:55.848 --> 26:57.817
Of blowing up the dump
or getting back?

26:57.884 --> 27:01.353
Well, uh, both,
especially the latter.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.521
Fair.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.991
Fair. You wouldn't say good?

27:05.057 --> 27:07.994
Not if you want me
to tell you what I think.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.628
Very interesting, isn't it?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.630
Not, come to think about it

27:11.698 --> 27:15.802
that I have any seriously
pressing engagements.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.837
Colonel, did you
have a good life?

27:17.904 --> 27:20.239
Fine life, Bindle.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.977
Especially here
on the islands. And you?

27:25.044 --> 27:28.214
Oh, I can't complain.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.350
You know, that's
the worst part about war.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.453
You meet somebody,
you get to know them

27:34.520 --> 27:36.255
wham, you never see them again.

27:36.322 --> 27:40.026
You see something, but you
never know how it ends.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.028
Be, uh, nice to know right now

27:42.094 --> 27:45.297
how all this is going
to end, wouldn't it?

27:45.364 --> 27:46.899
It certainly would.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.637
You will bow
to the Japanese officer

27:51.704 --> 27:54.273
as representative
of His Imperial Majesty!

27:56.142 --> 27:57.810
Lower!

27:58.911 --> 28:00.713
Fellow Orientals

28:00.780 --> 28:04.016
the hand of His Imperial
Majesty, the Emperor

28:04.083 --> 28:06.185
has put an end
to your domination

28:06.252 --> 28:09.288
by an exploiting and
arrogant American race.

28:12.825 --> 28:15.494
It will next put an end
to a system of education

28:15.561 --> 28:19.065
designed to impress upon you
a sense of inferiority.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.936
Señor Bello.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.339
Step forward, please.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.979
As principal of this school,
you will haul down the flag.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.533
Señor Bello

28:54.600 --> 28:58.070
unless you haul down the flag,
you will hang in its place.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.811
[dramatic music]

29:06.712 --> 29:07.947
[thud]

29:10.850 --> 29:12.651
You contempt..

29:12.718 --> 29:14.453
For the last time,
Señor Bello--

29:14.520 --> 29:17.056
Señor Bello,
haul down the flag.

29:17.123 --> 29:20.526
I speak to you in the name
of every man, woman, and child

29:20.592 --> 29:22.929
in the United States.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.302
[praying in Latin]

29:30.369 --> 29:32.271
[dramatic music]

29:42.982 --> 29:44.750
- Alright, Bernessa.
- Yes, sir.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.086
- Let's get under way.
- Yes, sir.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.391
[drum beats]

29:53.625 --> 29:55.461
Break it up.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.831
[drum beats continue]

30:05.037 --> 30:07.339
(female #1)
'He was so little'

30:07.406 --> 30:10.176
not a healthy child.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.378
He hated Americans
because his father

30:12.444 --> 30:14.280
had fought with Rinaldo.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.083
It is Miss Barnes.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.185
(Miss Barnes)
'I gave him an apple.'

30:19.251 --> 30:23.255
It was the first he'd ever seen.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.258
And then we became friends.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.294
Oh.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.464
Here, lady,
you'd better sit down.

30:32.531 --> 30:33.799
No.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.501
Ah.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.139
(Joe)
'What happened?'

30:40.206 --> 30:42.474
(Maximo)
'The Japs came into Balintawak"

30:43.876 --> 30:46.512
He was not a brave man.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.281
He was too terrified
even to speak.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.551
But when they ordered him
to haul down our flag

30:52.618 --> 30:54.620
he could only shake his head.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.958
And then they hanged him

31:00.026 --> 31:01.994
in the schoolyard

31:02.061 --> 31:04.630
in the presence of his pupils.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.633
It was a bad thing to look at.

31:14.806 --> 31:17.776
I am Miss Barnes, schoolteacher.

31:17.843 --> 31:19.912
Who are you and
what is your rank?

31:19.979 --> 31:22.448
- Colonel Madden, ma'am.
- Colonel, is it?

31:22.514 --> 31:24.883
Then I'm sure you'll know
what must be done.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.685
'When you attack the village'

31:26.752 --> 31:28.787
'attend especially
to the Japanese Captain.'

31:28.854 --> 31:30.489
'It was he who gave the order.'

31:30.556 --> 31:32.324
We're not attacking
the village, Miss Barnes.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.594
You're an American, are you not?

31:35.661 --> 31:38.897
It was your flag he refused
to lower, not his.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.732
Village isn't much
out of our way, colonel.

31:40.799 --> 31:43.769
Our only chance at getting that
gasoline dump is by surprise.

31:43.835 --> 31:45.437
Yes, but--

31:45.504 --> 31:48.207
Attacking that village puts
the whole countryside on alert.

31:48.274 --> 31:52.444
I'm thinking of
70,000 men on Bataan.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.181
How do you fellas feel about it?

31:55.247 --> 31:56.848
(male #4)
We think you're right, sir.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.119
Are you proposing, sir,
to leave this crime unavenged?

32:00.186 --> 32:03.089
We fight for the Philippines,
not for revenge.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.423
- Bernessa?
- Yes, sir.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.858
- We're moving out immediately.
- Yes, sir.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.494
Now, you stay here
with Miss Barnes.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.529
You'll find food and blankets
in the lean-to.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.965
Take good care of her
till we get back.

32:13.032 --> 32:14.466
Take care of her, indeed.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.502
You think I'd stay
here for a moment?

32:16.568 --> 32:18.337
You can't go back
to the village.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.606
And furthermore, young man,
I am not accustomed

32:20.672 --> 32:23.475
to being ordered about by every
young popinjay in uniform.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.945
- The men are ready, sir.
- Goodbye, Miss Barnes.

32:27.013 --> 32:28.214
Colonel.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.683
You really are not
returning to the village?

32:32.718 --> 32:34.253
Really not.

32:34.320 --> 32:37.489
Then I shall give you
Buenaventura Bello's epitaph.

32:37.556 --> 32:41.260
Someday you may come back into
the village of Balintawak again

32:41.327 --> 32:44.663
and put it over his grave.

32:44.730 --> 32:47.033
"The place matters not.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.335
"Cypress or laurel or lily white

32:49.401 --> 32:51.903
'"scaffold or open plain'

32:51.970 --> 32:55.074
'combat or martyrdom's plight."

32:55.141 --> 32:58.544
'Those words were
written by Jose Risaldo'

32:58.610 --> 33:00.546
'the Philippines' greatest hero'

33:00.612 --> 33:04.183
'on the night before he was
executed by the Spaniards.'

33:04.250 --> 33:07.853
Remember those words.
Carry them in your heart.

33:07.919 --> 33:12.224
'So that wherever men fight
for freedom, it may be said.'

33:12.291 --> 33:15.661
"Here lies Buenaventura Bello.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.197
Schoolteacher of Balintawak."

33:28.140 --> 33:29.675
- Colonel.
- Yes.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.477
What are our chances now?

33:31.543 --> 33:33.779
- Good.
- Funny thing. So would I.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.450
[birds chirping]

34:00.772 --> 34:02.241
Hold it up.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.310
There's Mount Maravelas ahead.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.545
We ought to be two hours
from the airfield.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.813
We better split up.
Check your watch.

34:13.485 --> 34:17.089
Bernessa, that is
Mount Maravelas, isn't it?

34:17.156 --> 34:18.424
Yes, sir.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.692
We should hear
gunfire from Bataan.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.293
Yes, sir.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.431
- Cruz!
- Yes, sir.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.599
Hold this group here.
Keep 'em under cover.

34:27.666 --> 34:31.069
Bring along four men.
We'll take a look-see.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.254
[distant gunfire]

34:48.320 --> 34:50.422
[distant shouting]

35:04.170 --> 35:06.705
[shouting continues]

35:49.481 --> 35:50.682
Scouts.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.320
[screaming]

36:01.860 --> 36:03.729
[indistinct chattering]

36:18.710 --> 36:20.712
Give me a hand.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.190
- Bernessa.
- Yes, sir.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.725
Post some guards.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.295
[speaking Tagalog]

36:39.331 --> 36:41.733
- What happened?
- Bataan has fallen.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.435
[indistinct chattering]

36:43.502 --> 36:45.904
Seventy thousand men.
How could it happen?

36:45.971 --> 36:47.906
- We're beaten.
- The Japs have beaten us.

36:47.973 --> 36:50.242
Hunger and sickness
beat us, not the Japs.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.210
Why didn't America
send food and medicine?

36:52.278 --> 36:54.446
'Why didn't America help"

36:57.148 --> 37:00.352
Maybe you can still get away.
There is no more army here.

37:00.419 --> 37:03.221
Now, the fighting will be
done in Australia, sir.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.892
Maybe there will be
fighting here.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.927
Maybe the people
will want to fight.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.529
Sure. The people will fight.

37:10.596 --> 37:13.532
Against thousands of Japs?
After they've beaten our armies.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.839
We've fought that way before.
We've never been conquered.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.803
With bolos against machine guns?

37:17.869 --> 37:20.472
If schoolteacher can die
for the American flag.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.608
We can fight for
the Philippines.

37:22.674 --> 37:26.545
We must have a hope.
We cannot die for nothing.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.914
You remember the name,
Andres Bonifacio?

37:28.980 --> 37:30.248
Every Filipino does.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.918
If he sent a call,
would people answer?

37:32.984 --> 37:36.855
- Bonifacio's dead.
- But his grandson is alive.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.757
Among those prisoners.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.892
[speaking Tagalog]

37:40.959 --> 37:43.495
Maybe we'll be able
to find him, sir.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.469
[distant shouting]

37:57.108 --> 37:59.277
[dramatic music]

38:22.868 --> 38:24.870
[drumbeats]

38:59.705 --> 39:01.773
[drumbeats continues]

39:03.174 --> 39:05.377
That's for you, captain.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.588
- Alright, set him down.
- Don't set him down.

39:49.655 --> 39:52.157
Take him into the lean-to.
Put him down carefully.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.959
He's a very sick man.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.160
[speaking Tagalog]

39:55.226 --> 39:57.763
Which one of you
calls himself the cook?

39:57.829 --> 39:58.897
'Me.'

39:58.964 --> 40:00.899
I want hot water
and clear broth.

40:00.966 --> 40:03.334
Do you make broths?
Don't pretend if you don't.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.136
- Well, I--
- Good. Hurry off.

40:05.203 --> 40:08.006
Maximo, get these men
some water. They're thirsty.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.340
Yes, ma'am.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.309
Cook!

40:11.376 --> 40:13.579
Cook, that's a petticoat
you're gaping at.

40:13.645 --> 40:17.282
- You've seen one before.
- Yes. But not lately.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.551
Hurry with the broth.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.721
Who is he?

40:22.788 --> 40:25.791
He's the grandson
of Andres Bonifacio.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.694
No wonder you carried
him so carefully.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.031
Those men are waiting for you.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.573
- Where you from?
- From the north. Lingayen.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.809
- I've come to fight.
- We come from Batangas.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.944
- We've come to fight too.
- Good.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.647
Plenty of fighting to be done.
You bring any news?

40:48.714 --> 40:50.816
They say the Japs
have taken Bataan.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.818
I know.
How about Corregidor?

40:52.884 --> 40:55.954
They don't say about Corregidor.

40:56.021 --> 40:58.757
You can do most good
if you return

40:58.824 --> 41:00.926
and tell everyone
the war hasn't ended yet.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.895
Now, the people must fight.
We need men.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.598
We have no arms.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.400
- Where did you get this?
- Killed a Jap.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.737
Kill more Japs
and get more guns.

41:11.803 --> 41:14.973
When you have men in arms,
send your leaders to me.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.243
You'll know where we are.
Good luck.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.579
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.581
We'll drive all the Japs out.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.583
'We'll chase them
out of Balintawak.'

41:24.650 --> 41:26.585
(Madden)
'Sure you will, Maximo.'

41:26.652 --> 41:29.054
Maximo, hurry to the village.
Try to find some eggs.

41:29.120 --> 41:33.525
Don't forget those papers.
Hurry now.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.761
You know what this will
mean for the people?

41:35.827 --> 41:37.495
Reprisals and terror.

41:37.563 --> 41:40.065
It's always been an all-out war.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.067
Now there's no
pretense about it.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.936
You can't inflict this on them.
They've suffered too much.

41:45.003 --> 41:48.807
I'm...making arrangements
for you to leave the island.

41:48.874 --> 41:52.644
You can't ask me to leave.
My children are here, my work.

41:52.711 --> 41:55.080
Know what they do to Guerrillas?

41:55.146 --> 41:57.749
If Filipino women
can endure it, I can.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.751
- 'No. I'm afraid--'
- Besides..

41:59.818 --> 42:01.853
You need someone to nurse him.

42:01.920 --> 42:05.390
'At least until he's better.'

42:05.456 --> 42:06.992
We'll see.

42:07.626 --> 42:09.227
Oh, uh..

42:09.294 --> 42:12.931
Miss Barnes...you spoke of
an epitaph for Señor Bello.

42:12.998 --> 42:15.200
- Yes, I did.
- Get it ready.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.803
We're going into
Balintawak tonight.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.874
[door opens]

42:55.941 --> 42:58.209
(Madden)
'Colonel Roberts?'

42:58.276 --> 43:01.680
(Andres)
'Last time I saw him
he was still alive.'

43:02.513 --> 43:04.916
How about Alfonso?

43:04.983 --> 43:08.253
He was in pretty bad shape.

43:08.319 --> 43:10.588
He was still going.

43:10.656 --> 43:12.824
There was a rumor about
taking our entire outfit

43:12.891 --> 43:14.926
to the same prison camp.

43:14.993 --> 43:18.163
- You haven't eaten a thing.
- Sorry, ma'am. I'm not hungry.

43:18.229 --> 43:21.432
You can't get your strength
back if you don't eat something.

43:21.499 --> 43:24.502
Here's some real chicken broth.
If you knew the trouble--

43:24.569 --> 43:26.271
Sorry, ma'am.

43:28.874 --> 43:31.242
I don't know what
I'm going to do with him.

43:31.309 --> 43:33.945
- 'Have you seen Maximo?'
- He hasn't come back yet.

43:34.012 --> 43:36.114
Well, I can't imagine
what's happened to him.

43:36.181 --> 43:38.116
And Jose Lopez
and Tomas Rinaldo?

43:38.183 --> 43:40.318
They left for
Balintawak yesterday.

43:40.385 --> 43:42.888
And they haven't come back yet.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.891
He just won't eat.
I don't understand it.

43:45.957 --> 43:48.026
He's been through
a pretty rough experience.

43:48.093 --> 43:50.528
Yes, but his pulse is normal.
His eyes are clear.

43:50.595 --> 43:53.598
- What is his trouble?
- Among other things, a woman.

43:53.665 --> 43:57.168
A woman. This certainly isn't
the time for that sort of thing.

43:57.235 --> 43:59.404
He's gotta get her
out of his mind.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.673
Sometimes it isn't that easy.

44:03.909 --> 44:06.144
(Bindle)
'We spend the winter
in Palm Beach.'

44:06.211 --> 44:09.014
- Doing what?
- 'Oh, taking it easy.'

44:09.080 --> 44:11.582
- Have you seen Maximo?
- No, ma'am.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.185
Or Jose Lopez?
Or Tomas Rinaldo?

44:14.252 --> 44:15.987
No, ma'am.

44:18.890 --> 44:21.592
- Let's see. Now, where were we?
- Taking it easy.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.862
In Palm Beach, Florida, USA.

44:23.929 --> 44:27.098
Ah, yes. So we spend
the winter in Florida.

44:27.165 --> 44:29.434
Then we hop a train,
a streamliner, mind you.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.838
- Nothing but the best for us.
- We still don't buy tickets?

44:32.904 --> 44:34.840
Who buys tickets?

44:34.906 --> 44:38.276
'We hop off at New York
for the opening ball game.'

44:38.343 --> 44:41.012
- 'Crash a few shows.'
- Say, Joe.

44:41.079 --> 44:43.348
- Yes, Joe.
- When do we work?

44:43.414 --> 44:44.582
Never.

44:44.649 --> 44:48.286
I sure I'm going
to like the USA.

44:48.353 --> 44:51.389
Say, where you been? Pickle puss
has been looking for you.

44:51.456 --> 44:53.224
Oh, okay.

44:53.291 --> 44:56.895
'I know a place in New York that
makes hot dogs a foot long.'

44:56.962 --> 44:59.931
- 'A whole foot long?'
- With relish and mustard?

44:59.998 --> 45:01.833
- 'The works.'
- Mm.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.603
Maybe you're wondering how
we get money to buy hot dogs.

45:05.670 --> 45:08.406
There's ways and means of
getting money without working.

45:08.473 --> 45:10.508
- Strictly legal, mind you.
- Where have you been?

45:10.575 --> 45:15.213
The idea of a grown man talking
like that before these boys.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.715
- What have you there?
- A radio.

45:18.249 --> 45:19.751
Radio?

45:21.352 --> 45:22.352
Hey!

45:22.387 --> 45:23.654
[speaking Tagalog]

45:23.721 --> 45:27.192
Say, colonel, look.
A radio!

45:27.258 --> 45:29.427
Where did you pick it up,
in Balintawak?

45:29.494 --> 45:32.430
No. I stole it from the Japs.

45:32.497 --> 45:34.833
(woman on radio)
'Every man, woman, and child'

45:34.900 --> 45:37.168
'in the district
will be wiped out.'

45:37.235 --> 45:40.005
'Filipinos, do not resist.'

45:40.071 --> 45:44.009
'For every Japanese life,
we pay with 10 Filipino lives.'

45:44.075 --> 45:46.577
'Sixty Filipinos were
executed today.'

45:46.644 --> 45:50.081
'I now read the names of those
who paid with their lives'

45:50.148 --> 45:52.250
'for the recent disorders.'

45:52.317 --> 45:55.921
'In Balintawak, for the murder
of four Japanese officers.'

45:55.987 --> 45:58.256
'Forty Filipinos were executed"

45:58.323 --> 46:02.794
- Forty men.
- 'Tomas Rinaldo, age 28.'

46:02.861 --> 46:05.931
'Felipe Luiz, age 16.'

46:05.997 --> 46:09.534
'Juan Dios, age 30.'

46:09.600 --> 46:12.603
'Pablo Quincaro, age 19.'

46:12.670 --> 46:16.707
- 'Ramon Cuenca, age 35.'
- That's my father.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.977
They killed my father!

46:20.478 --> 46:22.013
(Barnes)
'Maximo.'

46:31.656 --> 46:33.959
[crying]

46:49.007 --> 46:51.376
[crying continues]

46:57.615 --> 47:00.018
The war hurts everybody.

47:01.519 --> 47:05.023
Rest a while. Then we'll send
you back to Balintawak.

47:05.090 --> 47:08.559
- Your mother will need you.
- But I'm coming back.

47:08.626 --> 47:10.862
You said I could.

47:13.731 --> 47:15.600
Sure, Maximo.

47:20.205 --> 47:22.974
(man on radio)
'Two submarines appeared
in the Gulf of Mexico'

47:23.041 --> 47:24.775
'and sank two American vessels.'

47:24.842 --> 47:29.414
'In Burma, British/Chinese
forces continue to withdraw.'

47:29.480 --> 47:31.525
'Last night, after six days
of ceaseless cannonading'

47:31.549 --> 47:34.819
'by the Japanese, the fortress
of Corregidor in Manila Bay'

47:34.886 --> 47:37.122
'and Forts Hughes,
Drum, and Frank'

47:37.188 --> 47:41.059
'were surrendered by
general Jonathan Wainwright.'

47:44.229 --> 47:46.097
[indistinct chattering]

48:12.690 --> 48:14.759
The news is a little tough.

48:14.825 --> 48:16.494
Tough?

48:16.561 --> 48:18.096
We're licked, Joe.

48:18.163 --> 48:21.132
Licked? When is a nation licked?

48:21.199 --> 48:23.134
Military textbooks
say a war is over

48:23.201 --> 48:25.136
when the objectives are taken.

48:25.203 --> 48:28.239
The United States
fought your grandfather.

48:28.306 --> 48:30.475
We found the textbooks
were wrong.

48:30.541 --> 48:31.442
Were they?

48:31.509 --> 48:33.678
You fought the Spaniards
for 300 years.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.013
Then the American came.

48:35.080 --> 48:38.283
And few revolutionaries
called "The Catapunan"

48:38.349 --> 48:40.285
took everything
we threw at them.

48:40.351 --> 48:42.753
Fought us to a standstill
with bolos and clubs.

48:42.820 --> 48:44.789
Now the Jap's here.

48:44.855 --> 48:48.159
What would've happened if
we hadn't fought the Spaniard?

48:48.226 --> 48:50.996
My grandfather hadn't
called out the Catapunan.

48:51.062 --> 48:53.264
- You'd be slaves.
- What are we now?

48:54.832 --> 48:57.902
I've been doing lot of thinking
these last few days, Joe.

48:57.969 --> 49:02.373
I wondered why you saved me
out of thousands of prisoners.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.176
- You picked the wrong guy.
- I picked Andres Bonifacio.

49:05.243 --> 49:06.811
I know you did.

49:06.877 --> 49:09.614
Now you expect him to announce
that Bonifacio's back.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.882
To arms, Filipinos!
Remember the Catapunan.

49:11.949 --> 49:16.354
Kill the Japs, even if you'll
be killed 10 to 1, 20 for 1.

49:16.421 --> 49:19.157
When there aren't any men, then
women and children, uselessly.

49:19.224 --> 49:22.260
- Uselessly?
- Alone, we're helpless.

49:22.327 --> 49:25.196
Where are all those American
warships we were promised?

49:25.263 --> 49:27.198
Where are those
American guns and planes?

49:27.265 --> 49:29.367
- Why didn't they come?
- I don't know.

49:29.434 --> 49:32.070
- Promise us they'll return.
- No, I can't.

49:32.137 --> 49:34.572
I should urge them on
to more slaughter?

49:34.639 --> 49:37.342
It's easy for you.
They're not your people.

49:39.177 --> 49:41.312
I don't mean that, Joe.

49:41.379 --> 49:44.182
I know you're a better
Filipino than I am.

49:46.084 --> 49:48.386
Maybe you should've
left me prisoner.

49:48.453 --> 49:50.621
We've taken too much
these last few months.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.423
Sure.

49:52.490 --> 49:56.294
A guy can only take so much.
Then he loses something.

49:56.361 --> 49:58.229
I know.

49:58.296 --> 50:01.299
I've seen too much.

50:01.366 --> 50:06.037
We don't know if the Americans
are coming back or not.

50:06.104 --> 50:08.273
A guy's got to have
something to live for

50:08.339 --> 50:10.475
before asking others to die.

50:10.541 --> 50:11.909
Sure.

50:11.976 --> 50:14.779
After a while you..

50:14.845 --> 50:16.781
You lose something.

50:18.483 --> 50:20.651
Andres, you feel strong
enough to go to Manila?

50:20.718 --> 50:23.154
- Getting rid of me?
- Yes. You don't belong here.

50:23.221 --> 50:24.555
I'm willing to fight.

50:24.622 --> 50:27.792
You got to believe in
what you're fighting for.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.594
Maybe if you go to Manila

50:29.660 --> 50:32.897
you'll find something that will
change your mind. Will you go?

50:32.963 --> 50:34.432
Sure.

50:34.499 --> 50:37.102
I wanna get a message through.
Got a contact there.

50:37.168 --> 50:39.104
We'll get you a monk's robe.

50:39.170 --> 50:41.339
You'll go to the chapter house
of the Dominicans.

50:41.406 --> 50:44.809
Ask for the prior. Tell him
you want to hear a confession.

50:45.910 --> 50:48.179
[soft music]

50:51.582 --> 50:55.086
(Dalisay)
To intercede for the soul
of Andres Bonifacio.

50:55.153 --> 50:56.921
Who has passed from this world.

50:56.987 --> 51:00.191
May he be set in a region
of peace and light.

51:00.258 --> 51:04.229
Through our lord and savior,
Jesus Christ. Amen.

51:43.901 --> 51:46.103
You have come from the prior?

51:48.273 --> 51:50.208
'You have come from the prior?'

51:50.275 --> 51:52.443
- Andres.
- Dalisay?

51:55.112 --> 51:58.048
- Is it Dalisay?
- Andres, Andres.

51:58.115 --> 52:01.186
I thought you're dead.

52:01.252 --> 52:04.522
'Andres, they're watching us.
Be careful.'

52:04.589 --> 52:07.558
- I must look at you.
- 'Don't.'

52:07.625 --> 52:09.860
There must be some place
we can talk.

52:13.164 --> 52:14.832
'Dalisay?'

52:14.899 --> 52:18.669
- 'You haven't gone?'
- No. I'm trying to think.

52:18.736 --> 52:20.671
There's a little park
behind the church.

52:20.738 --> 52:24.275
Wait a few moments after I go.
I'll meet you there.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.884
[leaves rustling]

52:47.131 --> 52:48.499
Dalisay.

52:48.566 --> 52:51.035
Darling.

52:51.101 --> 52:54.905
We have only a few moments
together and I'm crying.

52:54.972 --> 52:57.208
You haven't changed a bit.

52:57.275 --> 53:00.511
You're just as I remembered you
a thousand times.

53:00.578 --> 53:03.981
Can't tell you how much I wanted
this moment. How I wanted to--

53:04.048 --> 53:05.783
[match strikes]

53:09.019 --> 53:10.988
Is there someplace
we can be alone?

53:11.055 --> 53:12.323
Where? Where?

53:12.390 --> 53:14.925
They cast a long shadow.

53:14.992 --> 53:18.829
I don't care. I can't leave you
now that I found you.

53:18.896 --> 53:20.898
'What good can we do now?'

53:20.965 --> 53:23.768
Maybe the Americans
will come back someday.

53:23.834 --> 53:26.604
- I'll come back with them then.
- No.

53:26.671 --> 53:28.706
We're not waiting
for anyone to come back.

53:28.773 --> 53:30.708
We don't want freedom as a gift.

53:30.775 --> 53:34.379
We want it as something
we fought and die for.

53:37.014 --> 53:40.017
- I'll kill him if he returns.
- I've got to go now.

53:40.084 --> 53:41.819
You're throwing away
our happiness.

53:41.886 --> 53:44.422
- Come away with me.
- Are you with Madden?

53:44.489 --> 53:45.756
Yes. We're at Balintawak.

53:45.823 --> 53:48.593
When can I see you again?
When can I come back?

53:48.659 --> 53:53.063
Don't come back ever. Maybe
I'll be able to come to you.

53:53.130 --> 53:55.333
We must fight, Andres.

54:06.344 --> 54:09.380
- So you came back.
- Yeah. I saw Dalisay.

54:09.447 --> 54:11.382
- Good.
- You've known about her, huh?

54:11.449 --> 54:13.217
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?

54:13.284 --> 54:16.487
Ever thought I'd wanna know the
woman I love wasn't a traitor?

54:16.554 --> 54:18.689
I was under orders,
orders that might affect

54:18.756 --> 54:21.359
the safety of every American
and Filipino on the island.

54:21.426 --> 54:23.494
Don't talk to me
about the Filipinos.

54:23.561 --> 54:25.730
Mention freedom around them,
they don't stop to think.

54:25.796 --> 54:27.965
They walk empty-handed
into machine guns.

54:28.032 --> 54:30.401
But you and I, Joe,
we should know better.

54:30.468 --> 54:32.870
We should think
about our chances.

54:32.937 --> 54:35.640
You and Dalisay have
gone out of your heads.

54:35.706 --> 54:40.110
Okay, Andres, we're crazy.
We and 17 million Filipinos.

54:40.177 --> 54:43.213
- Why did you come back here?
- 'Cause I'm crazy, too.

54:43.280 --> 54:45.450
I want to keep fighting Japs.

54:45.516 --> 54:48.619
Although I know it's mad.
Don't get me wrong.

54:48.686 --> 54:50.855
No one's gonna use my name
to encourage people

54:50.921 --> 54:53.524
to kill themselves faster
than the Japs are doing it.

54:53.591 --> 54:56.794
I'll fight until Dalisay
decides to join me.

54:56.861 --> 54:59.864
After that, we're getting
out of here as fast as we can.

54:59.930 --> 55:02.800
Alright, Andres, if that's
the way you feel about it.

55:02.867 --> 55:05.836
We'll do the best
we can without you.

55:05.903 --> 55:10.475
But just between us lunatics,
I think we'll win.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.556
[speaking Tagalog]

56:04.529 --> 56:07.665
[speaking Tagalog]

57:23.440 --> 57:25.476
[guns firing]

57:33.651 --> 57:35.953
[indistinct chattering]

58:03.413 --> 58:05.049
But what is being done?

58:05.115 --> 58:07.818
Your Excellency,
we cannot find the enemy.

58:07.885 --> 58:10.755
We send 100 men,
and they see nothing.

58:10.821 --> 58:13.423
We send 10 men,
and they don't come back.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.860
We have set up severe
reprisals, Your Excellency.

58:17.094 --> 58:20.430
- Reprisals.
- 'Your Excellency.'

58:20.497 --> 58:22.733
Your Excellency,
you must let me resign.

58:22.800 --> 58:24.835
A dead man cannot
serve the Japanese

58:24.902 --> 58:26.837
no matter how hard you try.

58:26.904 --> 58:29.840
Look, they came into my bedroom
while I was asleep.

58:29.907 --> 58:33.711
And they painted this
on my pillow. Right next to my..

58:33.778 --> 58:35.412
To my throat.

58:35.479 --> 58:38.749
This is a sign of war.
This is my death warrant.

58:38.816 --> 58:41.118
You're in no danger.
We'll provide sentries.

58:41.185 --> 58:43.754
I'm the chief of police.
Had four sentries all night.

58:43.821 --> 58:45.956
You're under our protection.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.593
Protection?

58:48.659 --> 58:50.728
Did you protect
the mayor of LaGaspy?

58:50.795 --> 58:53.898
Or the commissioner
of Moyalas or the commiss--

58:53.964 --> 58:57.167
Six whole divisions
at your disposal.

58:57.234 --> 59:00.871
And you couldn't even
protect our friends.

59:00.938 --> 59:05.109
All you could think
about was reprisals.

59:05.175 --> 59:07.444
Send in Miss Delgado.

59:07.511 --> 59:09.814
You have my personal
guarantee of safety.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.683
- You may go.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.

59:14.051 --> 59:17.688
They might have just
as easily have slit my throat.

59:19.590 --> 59:22.059
Miss Delgado,
tell Colonel Coroki

59:22.126 --> 59:25.630
why we have failed to win
the Filipino people over.

59:25.696 --> 59:27.231
I wasn't aware that--

59:27.297 --> 59:29.433
The guerrillas have
the complete aid

59:29.499 --> 59:31.568
and sympathy of the people.

59:31.636 --> 59:35.372
We're interested only
in a frank answer.

59:35.439 --> 59:39.109
There's no advantage in
cooperating with the Japanese.

59:39.176 --> 59:41.846
A man obeys all
the Japanese laws.

59:41.912 --> 59:44.048
When he's taken
at random and shot

59:44.114 --> 59:47.451
his neighbor will think,
it does no good to obey.

59:47.517 --> 59:49.253
He might as well die fighting.

59:49.319 --> 59:50.888
You're a conquered people.

59:50.955 --> 59:53.223
What do you expect,
independence?

59:53.290 --> 59:55.225
That's not a bad idea.

59:56.326 --> 59:59.163
Miss Delgado, Tokyo
has graciously

59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.565
consented to grant
full independence

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:03.400
to its little
nephews and nieces.

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:07.004
'You will see the advantage
of cooperating with us.'

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:10.641
Why, we'll hold these islands
with only two divisions.

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.944
The granting of independence

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:16.480
must be an impressive occasion.

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.983
You will help us, Miss Delgado?

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:21.986
It will be a great honor,
Your Excellency.

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.988
Perhaps, it would be a good idea

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:26.523
to hold the ceremonies
at Balintawak.

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:29.760
It's the birthplace
of Philippine independence.

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:32.196
An intelligent suggestion.

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:38.235
The arrangements will be left
in Colonel Coroki's hands.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:41.238
To avoid any possible
interference with the ceremony

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:44.041
I suggest you keep
the place secret.

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:47.344
We wish to make that
a memorable occasion, colonel.

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:50.981
It will be a most memorable
occasion, Your Excellency.

01:00:51.048 --> 01:00:52.182
Yes.

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:56.086
Make it memorable, colonel.
Most memorable.

01:01:07.698 --> 01:01:10.200
You can find room for this.

01:01:11.568 --> 01:01:13.537
Captain, everything's
alright in Balintawak.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:16.606
- What did you tell them?
- What you told me to say.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.942
Tell me exactly.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.811
Told them not to do anything
to tip the Japs off.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:24.715
Do their business,
and do what the Japs said.

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:27.051
And when the shooting
started, scram.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:29.053
You said the Japs
promised independence?

01:01:29.119 --> 01:01:31.121
- Yeah.
- What did they say?

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.824
- Nothing.
- Bernessa, get all the men.

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:35.826
- Yes, captain.
- Private Cuenca?

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:37.828
- Yes, sir?
- You accomplished your mission.

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:40.230
He deserves a red star.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.365
Red star, indeed.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.567
In his last composition
he spelled liberty

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.569
with a "u" instead of an "e."

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.838
[drumbeats]

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:53.677
You know, colonel, it'll
only take one informer

01:01:53.744 --> 01:01:56.613
to tip this whole deal
off to the Japs.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.715
That's right.

01:01:58.783 --> 01:02:00.050
What of it?

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:03.120
Oh, nothing. Just thinking
out loud, I guess.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:08.793
I don't know what I'm standing
around for with so much to do.

01:02:08.859 --> 01:02:11.996
I've outlined a course of
study for the children.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:14.331
Tell them they must
keep up on their studies.

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.600
They must brush
their teeth twice a day

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.803
and eat lots of greens.

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:21.005
I'm leaving with Colonel Madden.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:24.674
- But I'm going along.
- That's out of the question.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.476
You must take charge
of the children.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.646
But he promised me.
He said I could be a scout.

01:02:29.713 --> 01:02:31.281
Yes, I did, and--

01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:35.152
You're playing at war too much
for your age. I think--

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:37.454
- I'm going to be a scout.
- You mustn't--

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:40.490
If you don't mind,
he's still my pupil.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.329
Now, get that nonsense
out of your head.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:48.232
- I'll get the outline.
- I'm not going back.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:51.969
Maximo, if you insist
on this stubbornness

01:02:52.036 --> 01:02:55.639
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to leave without saying goodbye.

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.908
I'm going with you.

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:03.814
Maximo.

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:05.782
Come here.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.253
Sit down.

01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:12.957
Miss Barnes loves you very much.

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:15.392
I know. I'm sorry,
but I want to go.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:16.626
You can't.

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:19.663
After tomorrow, Japs will
be chasing us night and day.

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:21.465
We'll have to move fast.

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:23.733
We'll sleep in swamps,
have days without food.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.735
Sounds okay to me.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.072
But you're much too
important to risk.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.140
You're the guy we're
fighting this war for.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:33.543
- I'd rather be a scout.
- This thing won't last forever.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:37.948
After it's over, you're going
to have to build and plan.

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:40.817
You'll help make the Philippines
a great nation.

01:03:40.885 --> 01:03:42.819
You did promise me.

01:03:42.887 --> 01:03:45.522
You even called me
Private Cuenca.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:48.392
Alright.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:52.762
I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.165
I'll make you a full colonel.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:03:59.769
Gee.

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.805
The first thing
an officer has to learn

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:04.208
is to take orders and
obey them to the letter.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.276
Remember what Miss Barnes said?

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:09.813
Take charge of the kids and make
them keep up in their studies.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.782
Stay out of trouble.
Got it?

01:04:12.849 --> 01:04:14.651
Yes, sir.

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:16.520
Okay, colonel.

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.923
- I'll be seeing you.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:23.527
(man on mic)
'In a few moments,
we'll be on air.'

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.930
'In the meantime,
here are the instructions'

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.932
'for those gathered
in this park.'

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:29.934
'You are enjoined
to obey strictly'

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.202
'the following regulations.'

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:36.373
'One, do not show any flag
but the Japanese flag.'

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.912
'Two, at the appropriate times
you will shout banzai, loudly.'

01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:45.182
'And with enthusiasm,
three times.'

01:04:45.249 --> 01:04:48.685
'Three, do not make
any suspicious movement.'

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:50.487
We are about to broadcast.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:53.958
There will be a complete silence
unless otherwise indicated.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:05:00.364
People of the Philippines, we're
broadcasting from Balintawak

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.532
'the birthplace
of Filipino freedom.'

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:05.702
'Seventeen million Filipinos are
gathered around their radios'

01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:09.473
'all over the island, invited
by the Japanese government.'

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:13.777
'Today, the seeds of Filipino
and Japanese friendship bloom.'

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:17.714
'This day will live forever
in every true Filipino.'

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:20.350
People of the Philippines,
we now bring to you

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:23.053
His Imperial Highness,
Prince Ito.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.690
Banzai!

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.492
Banzai!

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:30.294
Banzai!

01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:35.065
The Filipino nation
will be included

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:39.236
in the greater east Asia
cold prosperity sphere.

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:41.905
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:45.642
of His Imperial Majesty,
the Emperor of Japan.

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:54.884
I hereby proclaim to the world

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.886
the full and complete
independence

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.955
of the republic
of the Philippines.

01:05:59.023 --> 01:06:00.757
Banzai!

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:02.526
Banzai!

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:05.495
'There is lavish cheers obtained
from the people of Balintawak.'

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:07.664
'His imperial highness,
Prince Ito, has retired.'

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:09.633
'Miss Dalisay Delgado's
crossing the platform'

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:12.502
'and will raise the first flag
of the new Philippine Republic"

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:14.538
'The guard of honor
will fire a volley'

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:17.707
to commemorate
this historic event.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.619
[gunshots] Take cover!

01:06:29.686 --> 01:06:31.288
Follow me!

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:50.440
This is Dalisay Delgado
speaking to you.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:52.876
For the first time I'm
able to speak the truth.

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:55.879
The Japanese have offered us
what they call independence.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.614
Let this be our answer.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:02.686
Take cover!

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.221
'Take cover!'

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:10.627
Fire at the radio.
Destroy it!

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.102
'Cover Bonifacio.'

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.944
Resist the Jap invader.
Head for the hills.

01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:30.214
Let's get out of here.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:07.717
[gunfire]

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:09.219
Cease firing!

01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:11.188
Cease firing!

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:14.524
Lieutenant, assemble the men,
round up the civilians.

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.760
This is what we get for
granting them independence.

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:19.095
I told home this
gesture was foolish.

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:20.729
'This is no way
to handle Filipinos.'

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.765
'I knew the girl
wasn't to be trusted.'

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:25.234
'From now on we'll smash
them before they resist.'

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.804
- Get out after them.
- Where do I look?

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:30.006
Anywhere, but find them,
especially the girl.

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:33.877
I want them hounded until every
one is brought back to me.

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:42.319
Let me go. Let me go.
Let me go.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.455
Let me go.

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:48.758
Your Excellency, I saw this boy
direct a crowd off the field.

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:51.661
I caught him as he was
trying to run away.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.612
Where did you get this?

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.453
Where did you get this?

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.357
Where are their headquarters?

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:22.859
Talk!

01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:31.801
Where did they go?

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:34.170
Don't.

01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:36.171
I'll show you.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.174
I'll show you where they went.

01:09:38.242 --> 01:09:39.943
Alright.

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:03.433
You know what I've
been thinking?

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.503
Wouldn't it be nice if we
were on that road up above

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.573
and had a bunch of
Japs caught down here?

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:12.442
We could pick 'em off like ducks
in a shooting gallery.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:14.411
We'd murder them.

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.994
Hold it up.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.229
Here, catch your breath.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:47.143
We could come down that road

01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:49.979
and catch the Japs
like rats in a trap.

01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:52.248
They wouldn't have a chance.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.622
I'm alright.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.091
[speaking Tagalog]

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:04.027
Come on, honey.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.955
There they are. Stop at
the head of the canyon.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.557
I know what you're thinking.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:36.460
- You do? How come?
- I'm psychic.

01:11:37.093 --> 01:11:39.028
What's that?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.769
Take cover!

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.883
Boy, could we murder them.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.530
Stop it! Stop it!

01:12:20.203 --> 01:12:22.005
[screaming]

01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:36.953
[machine gun firing]

01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:57.874
Maximo.

01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:59.308
Maximo.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.578
- Maximo.
- I won't tell.

01:13:01.645 --> 01:13:03.447
I won't tell, I won't tell.

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:05.715
It's Miss Barnes, Maximo.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.456
They didn't get you, did they?

01:13:12.522 --> 01:13:14.724
No, dear, they didn't.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:20.997
They took my eagle away.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.842
- Miss Barnes.
- Yes, dear?

01:13:34.043 --> 01:13:36.780
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:41.885
I'm sorry I didn't learn
to spell liberty.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.658
Dear God.

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:51.461
Whoever learned it so well.

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:55.024
Colonel Madden.

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:57.060
Australia has been trying
to get you, sir.

01:14:57.126 --> 01:15:01.030
- Where is your radio set up?
- This way, sir.

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:12.241
[speaking Tagalog]

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:21.284
About two weeks, sir.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.920
I think a razor, sir.

01:15:23.987 --> 01:15:25.622
Thank you.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:33.396
Bernessa, we're going on ahead.

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:36.499
We're gonna have to leave you,
I got word from headquarters.

01:15:36.566 --> 01:15:39.669
- We're going, aren't we?
- No, we have to move fast.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:41.905
Your best bet is break
up into small groups

01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:44.073
and head for this spot
in northern Leyte.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.075
American submarines have
been putting in there.

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:48.712
- What's up, Joe?
- I don't know yet.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:51.080
Maybe something big.

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:53.549
Well, good luck.

01:15:53.617 --> 01:15:54.818
Goodbye, colonel.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.185
Oh, Joe.

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.354
Yes?

01:15:58.421 --> 01:15:59.689
Good luck.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:01.691
Thanks, Andres.

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.993
I'll be seeing you.

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:08.732
[birds chirping]

01:17:00.684 --> 01:17:02.185
Hey!

01:17:02.686 --> 01:17:04.187
Bernessa.

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:05.889
'Santo.'

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.925
- Pepe. Captain.
- Bernessa, how are you?

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:11.427
- We had word you were coming.
- Where is Colonel Madden?

01:17:11.494 --> 01:17:13.930
Headquarters sent for him,
they took him to Australia.

01:17:13.997 --> 01:17:15.631
He'll be back soon.

01:17:15.699 --> 01:17:17.767
There's a camp ahead,
it's not very far.

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:19.302
Come on, let's go.

01:17:19.368 --> 01:17:20.970
Thank you, Bernessa.

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:33.149
Glad to see you.
I'm Captain Bonifacio.

01:17:33.216 --> 01:17:35.819
Welcome, captain.
We're glad to see you.

01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:40.757
What are these people
doing here?

01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:42.425
They're waiting
for the submarine.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.394
There are thousands more with
their families all over here.

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:50.066
These people look like
they're starving.

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:52.268
Why don't you spread
over the countryside?

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:54.070
We must stay together.

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:56.105
There's rumor that the
action's taking place here.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:58.641
You'd risk lives on a rumor?

01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:00.443
The rumors we hear are true.

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:03.012
How long have you been
waiting for this submarine?

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:04.914
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks?

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:07.616
How much food do you think
a submarine can bring

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:09.252
if it comes?

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:12.155
Not much food, but many guns.

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:14.157
- Have you had any word?
- Not yet.

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:16.592
We've been sending
two men out in a boat.

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:18.227
They fly an American
flag and wait.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:20.529
Maybe a submarine will see them.

01:18:20.596 --> 01:18:22.531
What if a Jap plane sees them?

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:25.434
Then we send two other men.

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:29.238
Why are you puzzled?
Aren't you a Filipino?

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:48.291
Hey, whose idea was it
to volunteer for this job?

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:50.426
Yours.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:53.763
I must have been delirious
for lack of food.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:58.601
Well, maybe I'll
dream me up a nice steak.

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.603
Dream me one, too.

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.605
How would you like it?

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:04.373
Medium rare.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.309
Coming up.

01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:17.753
Hey, submarine!

01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:19.555
Submarine!

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:22.325
Hey, submarine!

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:24.060
'Submarine!'

01:19:24.127 --> 01:19:26.729
'Submarine, submarine.'

01:19:26.796 --> 01:19:28.832
[cheering]

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:35.899
'Andres. Andres.'

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.901
Captain Bonifacio.

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:40.369
- Hello, Andres.
- Hey, hiya, Joe.

01:20:40.436 --> 01:20:42.171
Hey, you look naked.

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:44.640
Well, you're all set.

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:46.575
You're going out.

01:20:46.642 --> 01:20:48.844
I'm not leaving, Joe.

01:20:49.712 --> 01:20:51.915
I belong here.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:21:01.124
This is Commander Wait
of the United States navy.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.026
He has some good news for you.

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:05.194
'I heard so much about
what you've been doing'

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:08.131
I finally persuaded headquarters
to let me take this mission

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:10.599
so I could see for myself.

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.835
I don't deserve to
bring you this news

01:21:12.902 --> 01:21:14.470
but...I'm proud that I am.

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:17.506
Two and a half years ago, we
promised the Filipino people

01:21:17.573 --> 01:21:19.408
we'd come back.

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:21.310
Well, we're coming.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.646
'On October 20,
at 10:00 in the morning'

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:27.150
'the soldiers of the American
army will land on Leyte.'

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.485
The navy will prepare the way.

01:21:29.552 --> 01:21:31.154
Two hours before
the actual landings

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.157
there will be heavy navy
bombardment on all landing areas

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:37.426
part of my job is to get all
Filipino civilians in the areas

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:39.895
to evacuate nine days
before d-day.

01:21:39.963 --> 01:21:43.299
That will give the Japs an idea
where to expect the landings.

01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:45.935
There's noting else we can do.
We can't risk civilian lives.

01:21:46.002 --> 01:21:49.305
There haven't been civilians
here since the fall of Bataan.

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:52.308
It'll save American lives and
help make the landing safe.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.177
Our people will not evacuate.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:56.212
(male #5)
'That's right.'

01:21:56.279 --> 01:21:59.248
I'm sure glad you guys
are on our side.

01:21:59.315 --> 01:22:01.750
Well, that won't be necessary.
Headquarters has sent me here

01:22:01.817 --> 01:22:05.521
to help you do a job that's more
important, if we can do it.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:07.590
'The moment naval
bombardment begins'

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:10.593
'the Japs will know the exact
locations of our landings.'

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.795
'They'll immediately try
to rush reinforcements'

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.397
'to those spots.'

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:17.400
The only road capable
of handling heavy transport

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:20.103
runs through
the village of Balog.

01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:22.338
If we can block that
road, and hold it

01:22:22.405 --> 01:22:24.173
the Japs can't
get through in time.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.309
How long do we hold them?

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:29.445
From 8 a.m. when the bombardment
begins until 11:00.

01:22:29.512 --> 01:22:32.448
'By that time Macarthur's
beachhead should be secure.'

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:33.716
Okay.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.152
But the army doesn't
expect to have forces

01:22:36.219 --> 01:22:38.254
at Balog until 2:30.

01:22:38.321 --> 01:22:40.256
Which means 6 1/2 hours

01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:42.891
before we can figure
on any help.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.627
Okay.

01:22:46.162 --> 01:22:48.364
- Is that all, sir?
- I think so.

01:22:48.431 --> 01:22:51.000
- You don't have much equipment.
- We'll get more at Balog.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:52.701
There's a Jap supply
depot there.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:55.871
That's nothing but open country,
nothing but rice paddies around.

01:22:55.938 --> 01:22:57.573
We know.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.609
What this amounts to a surprise
attack in broad daylight

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:03.546
in open country where the Japs
would expect something.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:05.714
That's right.
It won't be easy.

01:23:05.781 --> 01:23:08.251
I think you can report
to headquarters commander

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.219
that the mission
will be accomplished.

01:23:10.286 --> 01:23:14.357
Yes, sir. Sir, do you have any
idea how it's gonna be done?

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:15.558
Sure.

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:18.394
So I can tell my grandchildren,
how will you do it?

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:20.996
Trickery, commander,
sheer trickery.

01:23:21.064 --> 01:23:23.232
As a matter of fact
an old Filipino trick

01:23:23.299 --> 01:23:25.468
that I learned the hard way

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:28.404
from Captain Bonifacio
grandfather.

01:23:31.874 --> 01:23:34.277
[birds chirping

01:24:02.838 --> 01:24:04.707
- Any sign of anything?
- No, Your Excellency.

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.975
Have you checked the
undergrowth over there?

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.777
Yes, Your Excellency.
Nothing suspicious.

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:12.215
It's very strange, civilians are
evacuating this area.

01:24:12.281 --> 01:24:14.350
- Double the sentries.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:18.787
[explosions]

01:24:36.172 --> 01:24:38.141
[gunshots]

01:24:57.126 --> 01:24:58.627
[speaking Tagalog]

01:24:58.694 --> 01:25:01.130
[gunshots continue]

01:25:43.038 --> 01:25:45.308
Get down, you idiot!

01:26:06.061 --> 01:26:07.863
Give me another clip.

01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:12.167
[gunshots continue]

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.918
One more to go.

01:26:29.985 --> 01:26:31.854
I'll take the first one.

01:26:52.575 --> 01:26:55.778
- You got a grenade, Bernessa?
- I'm all out, sir.

01:26:56.379 --> 01:26:57.680
Hey, Bindle!

01:26:57.746 --> 01:26:59.181
Yeah?

01:26:59.248 --> 01:27:00.749
How's your pitching arm?

01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:03.486
[gunfire]

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:46.028
[machine gun firing]

01:27:50.366 --> 01:27:52.868
Come on.
Let's get to work.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:15.524
Japanese land mines, sir.

01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:17.693
Andres, some land mines.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.996
Now plant them forward so they
won't mess up our tank traps.

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:23.566
Put Santos in charge
of TNT for the bridge.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.843
- Santos, come on.
- 'Yes, sir.'

01:28:24.867 --> 01:28:26.635
- Bernessa.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:26.702 --> 01:28:29.271
Get about 20 men. We'll pick out
some defense positions.

01:28:29.338 --> 01:28:30.406
Yes, sir.

01:28:30.473 --> 01:28:32.408
What do you got here?

01:28:32.475 --> 01:28:36.311
Nothing big enough
to stop a tank, colonel.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.041
'Miss Barnes.'

01:29:06.108 --> 01:29:08.243
They're bringing back
the books they hid

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:10.446
while the Japs were here.

01:29:10.513 --> 01:29:11.980
[bell tolls]

01:29:13.416 --> 01:29:15.718
And our boys are landing now.

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.587
[cannon fire]

01:29:33.268 --> 01:29:35.704
[explosions]

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:01.764
[birds chirping]

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.028
[explosion]

01:30:49.578 --> 01:30:52.080
[gunfire continues]

01:32:15.097 --> 01:32:16.632
This is it.

01:32:16.699 --> 01:32:18.533
[machine gun firing]

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:29.111
Fire at the parapet.

01:32:56.104 --> 01:32:59.041
Captain Jackson reporting, sir.
Ready to take over.

01:32:59.107 --> 01:33:02.044
- They're all yours.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:04.346 --> 01:33:05.614
Hey.

01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:07.950
You're three minutes late.

01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:17.760
Andres.

01:33:18.994 --> 01:33:21.196
I brought you something.

01:33:22.364 --> 01:33:23.932
Free Filipino soil.

01:33:23.999 --> 01:33:25.600
You better get
this arm bandaged.

01:33:25.668 --> 01:33:27.235
There's still lots to do.

01:33:27.302 --> 01:33:30.706
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:36.578
(narrator)
The blood, sweat, and tears
have not been in vain.

01:33:36.645 --> 01:33:39.748
Freedom is on the march again.
