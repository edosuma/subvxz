00:04.743 --> 00:07.137
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.181 --> 00:09.879
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.922 --> 00:11.489
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.533 --> 00:14.710
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.753 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

02:54.348 --> 02:56.219
But that's what
I'm saying, Dad.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.003
I've done a ton
of research already.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.831
It's not that big of a deal.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.311
You're gonna get weird.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.443
I'm already weird.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.575
No, you're perfect,
perfectly weird.

03:04.619 --> 03:07.404
You can get a great education homeschooling,

03:07.448 --> 03:09.493
and I promise I'll
still socialize

03:09.537 --> 03:10.886
so I won't get weirder.

03:10.929 --> 03:13.062
I've got Chloe.
She's my best friend.

03:13.105 --> 03:14.977
It's not gonna happen.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.631
Look, I know you're anxious.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.286
Your mom told me that
after the drill, you--

03:19.329 --> 03:21.331
It's not just one drill, Dad.

03:21.375 --> 03:24.421
We've had three lockdown drills
since the school year started.

03:24.465 --> 03:25.857
The world is going to crap.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.990
It's only a matter of time
before some madman

03:28.033 --> 03:29.034
walks in my classroom.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.253
Don't say that.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.777
Don't ever say that.

03:32.821 --> 03:36.781
What, Jesus, you're 15, Lily,
you're staying in school.

03:39.131 --> 03:43.179
Look, there's a lot of stuff
that's out in the world.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.703
But the chances of anything
bad actually happening--

03:49.316 --> 03:52.884
Stay here. You don't move.
Don't move.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.364
Ma'am!

03:54.408 --> 03:55.844
Miss, are you okay? Miss?

03:55.887 --> 03:57.237
No, wait, wait, wait.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.283
Damn it.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.069
What the hell?

04:04.113 --> 04:05.723
She ran right in front of me.
- Call 911.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.247
I didn't see her.
I didn't have time to--

04:07.290 --> 04:09.249
Call 911 now.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.902
Easy, easy, easy.
- No!

04:10.946 --> 04:12.730
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.689
Hey, slow down.
Easy, miss, calm down.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.778
Easy, no, no, no.
I'm the police.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.084
Look.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.347
That's right.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.348
I'm here to help you.

04:21.391 --> 04:23.001
Calm down. Slow down.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.394
Slow down. Slow down.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.395
Look at me. Look at my eye.

04:25.439 --> 04:26.744
You're gonna be strong now.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.572
You need to calm down,
though, all right?

04:28.616 --> 04:30.226
Slow your breathing
down for me.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.662
That's it. Here.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.098
I'm gonna take your pulse,
you're gonna take mine.

04:33.142 --> 04:34.622
Feel my pulse?

04:34.665 --> 04:36.145
If I'm calm, you can
be calm, all right?

04:36.188 --> 04:37.842
You gotta be strong for me.

04:37.886 --> 04:38.887
All right?

04:38.930 --> 04:40.149
Slow your breathing.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.064
I've called for an ambulance.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.326
It's on its way.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.719
He--

04:44.762 --> 04:45.676
He who?

04:45.720 --> 04:48.200
Is someone chasing you?

04:48.244 --> 04:50.072
He hurt you?
- Yes.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.421
You know who he is?
You know his name?

04:51.465 --> 04:52.901
Hold on.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.120
Over here!

04:55.164 --> 04:56.208
NYPD!

04:56.252 --> 04:59.255
Over here, bring a stretcher!

04:59.299 --> 05:00.604
Calm down, all right?

05:00.648 --> 05:02.302
I'm gonna stay with you,
all right?

05:02.345 --> 05:03.912
I'm gonna help you.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.741
Hey!

05:06.784 --> 05:08.482
Hold on one second.
- No, no, no, no!

05:08.525 --> 05:11.006
Whoa, no, no, no, no, no,

05:11.049 --> 05:12.529
I'm not leaving you.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.270
I'm just getting them
over here, all right?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.750
I'm not gonna leave you.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.273
I'm getting the ambulance.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.622
I'll be right back.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.494
I'm not leaving you.
I'll be right back.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.322
Move these cars.
Come on, let's go!

05:22.365 --> 05:24.454
Come on, move, move, move!
Come on! Let's go, people.

05:24.498 --> 05:26.064
Let's get these cars
out of the way.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.849
Let's go, move, move, move!

05:27.892 --> 05:30.199
Let's go!

05:40.340 --> 05:41.863
NYPD!

05:41.906 --> 05:44.648
Hey! Hey!

05:50.175 --> 05:52.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:52.395 --> 05:53.396
Hey!

07:00.028 --> 07:01.464
What do we got?

07:01.508 --> 07:03.423
We're canvassing for
witnesses, surveillance video.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.554
What's going on?

07:04.598 --> 07:05.729
Who are you?

07:05.773 --> 07:06.904
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.863
Detective Frank Cosgrove,
2-7.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.952
Detective Jalen Shaw, 3-2.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.432
I got the handle
five minutes ago.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.565
No, I got this.

07:15.609 --> 07:16.827
I was with the girl
when she was shot,

07:16.871 --> 07:18.612
so I'm not going anywhere.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.487
Just so I'm clear,
if you were with the girl,

07:24.531 --> 07:27.272
how did she get shot?

07:27.316 --> 07:31.712
I saw the victim running down
the street covered in blood.

07:31.755 --> 07:35.498
She ran out into traffic,
got struck.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.675
I went over to her,
I tried to help her, I--

07:38.719 --> 07:41.112
tried to figure out
what was happening.

07:41.156 --> 07:42.810
Then I heard the sirens.

07:42.853 --> 07:46.030
I alerted the ambulance
about the girl, her location,

07:46.074 --> 07:48.729
I tried to get her through.
There was chaos.

07:48.772 --> 07:49.773
I cleared the street.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.383
That's when I heard it,
two pops,

07:51.427 --> 07:53.647
double tap like an execution.

07:53.690 --> 07:57.607
I saw a male running away,
hat, masked.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.479
I pursued.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.133
I lost him.

08:02.177 --> 08:03.657
It sounds like you did
what you had to do.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.876
What does that mean?

08:05.920 --> 08:08.009
It just means you tried
to save the girl's life, right?

08:09.576 --> 08:12.317
Yeah, I tried.

08:14.755 --> 08:16.539
Look, um...

08:16.583 --> 08:17.801
as far as you working
the case with me,

08:17.845 --> 08:19.499
I'm not really sure
how that works.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.804
No offense,
I'm new to Homicide.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.111
Well, I'm not so new.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.895
I'll handle it.
I'll make some calls.

08:24.939 --> 08:26.201
Maybe we can
work this together.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.900
I gotta go.
It's Shaw, right?

08:29.944 --> 08:31.032
Yeah.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.910
Excuse me.
You seen a little girl?

08:39.954 --> 08:42.696
She was sitting right there,
brown hair, brown eyes, 15?

08:53.707 --> 08:55.665
Lily, Lily.

08:55.709 --> 08:56.840
What the hell are you doing?

08:56.884 --> 08:57.972
I told you to stay
at the restaurant.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.669
I heard gunshots.
I got scared.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.192
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.846
Yeah, I understand that,
but when you hear gunshots,

09:02.890 --> 09:05.283
you run away from them, not
toward them, you understand?

09:07.416 --> 09:09.244
Ah, come here.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.942
Come here. I'm sorry.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.161
I'm fine.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.292
I appreciate that
you're caring about me.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.643
But next time,
you stay where you are

09:16.686 --> 09:19.167
or you run the opposite way, okay?

09:21.648 --> 09:24.041
So what happened?

09:24.085 --> 09:28.176
Uh, the girl she--
she got hit by a car.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.133
Then what?

09:30.874 --> 09:34.312
Look, I'm the first officer
on the scene

09:34.356 --> 09:35.575
so I need to take this case.

09:35.618 --> 09:39.100
I gotta go back to work.
- She's dead.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.058
Yeah.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.582
But I'm gonna find this guy
and I'm gonna

09:42.625 --> 09:43.713
make him pay for what he did.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.280
You always say that.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.412
What does that even mean?
He'll pay for it?

09:47.456 --> 09:50.938
Even if you catch him,
even if he goes to prison,

09:50.981 --> 09:53.505
that girl will still be dead.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.641
I need to get you
out of here, all right?

09:58.685 --> 10:01.339
I'm gonna put you in a taxi.
No, I'm gonna call your mom.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.124
She'll come pick you up.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.129
Sounds good. Thank you.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.786
I just got off the phone
with your captain.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.091
It's all good.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.571
You and Frank are gonna
take the lead.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.747
But we're gonna work the case
from here out of the 27.

10:17.791 --> 10:18.966
Copy that.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.713
I'm sorry you had to go
through all that, Frank.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.802
It's a hell of a thing to see.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.327
Do we know where
the shooter came from?

10:32.370 --> 10:33.676
A building, a restaurant?

10:33.720 --> 10:34.721
No clue.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.984
I turned, there he was.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.290
And before I could
even react, he shot her.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.553
What about the girl?
We have an ID yet?

10:41.597 --> 10:42.685
We're running the prints now.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.469
You recover any
personal belongings,

10:44.513 --> 10:46.602
jewelry, a phone, anything?

10:46.646 --> 10:47.951
No, nothing.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.214
Hey, I got a hit
on Missing Persons.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.695
Ava Marchenko,
15 years old.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.131
The girl's a Ukrainian refugee

10:54.175 --> 10:55.742
who came into the country
four months ago,

10:55.785 --> 10:57.265
was staying with her aunt.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.833
She's the one who reported her
missing two months later.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.357
That's her.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.663
Okay.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.099
Go talk to the aunt.

11:11.540 --> 11:12.802
<i>Look, if you don't mind,
I'd rather handle</i>

11:12.846 --> 11:14.325
this notification myself.

11:14.369 --> 11:16.980
Oh, taking charge
already, huh?

11:17.024 --> 11:18.721
No, it's just
I'm new to Homicide.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.071
I spent the last five years
in Narcotics.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.726
I've never done one of these.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.336
Be my guest.

11:37.044 --> 11:38.959
- Ms. Marchenko.
- Yes?

11:39.002 --> 11:42.789
I'm Detective Shaw.
This is Detective Cosgrove.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.486
Is this about Ava?

11:44.529 --> 11:46.227
You found my niece, huh?

11:46.270 --> 11:47.837
Is she okay?

11:49.621 --> 11:51.406
We found her.

11:51.449 --> 11:54.452
But I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

11:56.411 --> 11:57.455
She's dead.

11:59.109 --> 12:02.852
Someone killed her
earlier this morning.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.724
Killed her?

12:04.767 --> 12:06.073
Why would--

12:06.116 --> 12:07.901
I'm so sorry for your loss.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.603
This is on you!

12:14.646 --> 12:16.561
You let this happen!

12:30.575 --> 12:34.275
She came here four months
ago from Ukraine.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.581
She lost all her family
in the war,

12:36.625 --> 12:40.281
my sister and her husband.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.283
I'm all she had left.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.501
She ran away?

12:43.545 --> 12:45.808
Is that why
you reported her missing?

12:45.852 --> 12:49.203
You don't understand
what is it like in Ukraine,

12:49.246 --> 12:52.510
scared every moment.

12:52.554 --> 12:55.339
Then she comes here
and it all looks so fun,

12:55.383 --> 12:57.864
like an amusement park.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.474
I tried to warn her.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.477
I told her she needed
to be careful, stay inside.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.741
But she didn't believe me.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.310
I woke up one day
and she was gone.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.355
I looked everywhere.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.184
So that's when
you called the police?

13:14.228 --> 13:18.536
But they--you--

13:18.580 --> 13:19.755
didn't do anything.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.325
Just to be clear,
you never heard

13:24.368 --> 13:25.935
from her again after that day?

13:25.979 --> 13:29.112
No, never.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.898
She left and that was that.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.213
Actually, that wasn't so bad
for your first notification.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.475
I'm not so sure about that.

13:44.519 --> 13:45.955
No, I've seen worse.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.044
What about an autopsy,
you ever been to one?

13:48.088 --> 13:49.219
Can't say I have.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.438
Well, in here,

13:50.481 --> 13:52.527
you definitely
won't get slapped.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.921
Good to know.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.010
You got kids, Shaw?

13:57.053 --> 13:58.750
No.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.404
Good.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.798
It makes it a little easier.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.599
There's clear evidence
of repeated

14:21.643 --> 14:24.428
and recent sexual trauma.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.040
No semen or DNA on the body.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.259
But the vaginal tearing
definitely occurred

14:29.303 --> 14:31.174
in the past 48 hours.

14:31.218 --> 14:34.874
Somebody scooped her up,
started trafficking her.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.049
That's probably
why she was running,

14:36.092 --> 14:38.355
trying to get away
from a john or pimp.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.531
Hmm.

14:42.533 --> 14:43.752
Anything else?

14:43.795 --> 14:45.406
Stomach contents,
anything interesting?

14:45.449 --> 14:47.277
More like expensive.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.932
Lots of undigested caviar.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.934
One minute she's eating
caviar somewhere,

14:51.978 --> 14:54.023
the next,
she's running down 8th Avenue

14:54.067 --> 14:56.025
running for her life.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.548
That it?

14:57.592 --> 14:59.899
Only other thing that's sort
of interesting is,

14:59.942 --> 15:03.380
her face and hands had traces
of saltwater on them.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.687
So she's got saltwater
on her and caviar in her.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.558
It sounds like
a boat party to me.

15:07.602 --> 15:11.084
Chelsea Pier is five blocks
from the crime scene.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.956
As you can see, we have
a lot of party boats here.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.089
Yeah, what about a party
boat that serves caviar?

15:16.132 --> 15:18.091
Caviar? No, none of these.

15:18.134 --> 15:21.572
But there was a mega yacht
over there,

15:21.616 --> 15:24.227
beautiful 250-footer.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.099
- Where is it now?
- Don't know.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.622
Pushed off around 9:00 a.m.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.145
I need the information
on that yacht

15:29.189 --> 15:30.842
and any surveillance you got.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.801
Yeah, sure thing, but I'm
gonna need to see a warrant

15:32.844 --> 15:34.324
or some sort of court order.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.544
My boss doesn't like
sharing info.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.198
And I don't like
young girls getting

15:38.241 --> 15:40.243
whored out on mega yachts.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.984
So I'd say we're even.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.813
Look, buddy, just so you know,
my next request

15:44.856 --> 15:47.859
is gonna be even less desirable
for you and your boss.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.819
So if you're smart or a man of
just an average intelligence,

15:50.862 --> 15:53.039
go get us
the information we need.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.525
What?

16:01.569 --> 16:02.700
What's so funny?

16:02.744 --> 16:05.007
Nothing,
just enjoying your swag.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.356
Yeah, I don't buy that.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.314
I'm not selling
anything, Frank.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.532
Nothing negative.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.447
You know,
just taking it all in.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.362
My last partner was 29,
Puerto Rican,

16:12.406 --> 16:14.016
a lot of bad tattoos,
you know--

16:14.060 --> 16:15.975
Do you ever say
what you mean?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.499
What I mean is, it's not that
damn hard to get a subpoena,

16:18.542 --> 16:20.805
so maybe refrain
from threatening people.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.546
That wasn't threatening,
that was encouraging.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.635
Well, all we need
is an encouraged idiot

16:24.679 --> 16:26.550
telling a virtuous ADA
that we threatened him

16:26.594 --> 16:28.074
to get the records.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.076
Because then every single piece
of evidence that we get

16:30.119 --> 16:33.035
based on that information
makes it tainted too.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.689
Fruit of the
poisonous tree, Frank.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.560
Are you a cop or a lawyer?

16:36.604 --> 16:38.214
- I happen to be both.
- Oh, you're kidding me.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.389
No.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.565
NYU, practiced for three years,

16:41.609 --> 16:43.915
it wasn't for me,
so I enrolled in the Academy.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.743
- I got two requests.
- Shoot.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.050
One, let's keep those
brilliant legal insights

16:48.094 --> 16:49.312
to yourself.

16:49.356 --> 16:52.402
And two, may I encourage you
to go find out

16:52.446 --> 16:54.926
why that idiot has taken
so long to find

16:54.970 --> 16:57.625
the information we need, please.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.279
- That's encouraging.
- Not threatening.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.455
No.
You see the difference?

17:01.498 --> 17:02.891
No.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.765
<i>Hell of a boat.</i>

17:07.809 --> 17:11.682
280 feet long, 12 cabins,
steel hull, pool,

17:11.726 --> 17:13.641
helipad, movie theater.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.251
Must be a great place
to throw a party.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.426
It is.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.559
Yeah, girls, champagne.

17:18.602 --> 17:19.908
Caviar, lots of caviar.

17:19.951 --> 17:20.996
What's this
all about, fellas?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.215
I've got a meeting
in ten minutes.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.564
You know this girl?

17:23.607 --> 17:24.652
No.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.436
You've never seen her before?

17:26.480 --> 17:27.785
I just told you.

17:27.829 --> 17:31.398
So she wasn't on that yacht
last night?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.487
I don't know. It's possible.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.792
It's not in my possession
at the moment.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.664
Care to elaborate?

17:36.707 --> 17:39.580
I only use the boat
one month a year in July.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.669
Charter it out
the rest of the time.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.149
Must get a pretty penny
for that.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.628
600 grand a week.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.195
Well, we're in the
wrong business, Frank.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.936
People love to lease.

17:47.979 --> 17:52.984
It's like they say, if it
dries, floats, flies or--

17:53.028 --> 17:55.117
better to lease.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.206
Yeah, that's great advice,
but we're much more interested

17:57.250 --> 18:00.035
in the name of the person
who leased that yacht.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.694
Lessee is a Delaware LLC,

18:06.737 --> 18:08.435
which is owned
by a Chechen corporation,

18:08.478 --> 18:10.567
which is owned by a series of
Russian limited partnerships.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.221
Shell game.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.876
The only person on the lease
is a 73-year-old car salesman

18:14.919 --> 18:17.748
from Grozny, which is
the capital of Chechnya,

18:17.792 --> 18:19.141
which is something
I just found out.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.838
So we're thinking that
this girl was trafficked.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.318
Sounds like that to me.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.234
I mean, she ran away from home.
My thinking?

18:25.278 --> 18:28.194
Somebody in her neighborhood
swept her up,

18:28.237 --> 18:29.673
pimped her out.

18:29.717 --> 18:33.155
The M.E. found clear signs
of repeated sexual trauma.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.026
So how can I help?

18:35.070 --> 18:37.681
Wondering if you know anybody
who pimps out young girls

18:37.725 --> 18:40.031
to rich Eastern Europeans
on super yachts.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.990
Well, not that matches
those particulars,

18:42.033 --> 18:44.035
but your instincts are right.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.908
Lots of sex workers tend
to end up on those yachts.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.388
Yeah, it seems
like nothing good happens

18:48.431 --> 18:50.216
when you put a bunch
of rich guys on a big boat.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.695
Yeah.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.567
So have you been able
to pull any security footage?

18:53.610 --> 18:55.699
Dockworker claims
the outside cameras

18:55.743 --> 18:57.179
weren't working that day.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.529
Yeah, for some reason,
those cameras

18:59.573 --> 19:01.270
never seem to be functional,

19:01.314 --> 19:03.751
which is why we put up
our own cameras

19:03.794 --> 19:05.535
down there near the pier.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.058
We also have some
in the parking area.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.974
I will have them pull up
security footage for you.

19:11.106 --> 19:15.371
This is Ava running from the
yacht heading east at 8:43 a.m.

19:15.415 --> 19:19.419
Then 30 seconds later,

19:19.462 --> 19:20.811
some guy chases after her.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.688
So Ava was on the yachts,
something bad happens,

19:27.731 --> 19:29.342
she runs like hell.

19:29.385 --> 19:32.606
This guy chases after her,
kills her five blocks away.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.216
The footage is so grainy.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.739
Are you sure this guy
is the shooter?

19:35.783 --> 19:37.828
No, it happened too fast.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.743
He had a mask on, so.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.571
Do we have any other video?

19:41.615 --> 19:42.746
No, this is it.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.748
What about the parking lot?

19:44.792 --> 19:46.446
Benson mentioned there
was cameras there.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.151
That's your car
in the parking lot.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.718
So?

19:57.761 --> 19:59.023
We're gonna need
a name of the customer.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.938
That's confidential information.

20:00.982 --> 20:03.114
It might be private,
but it's not confidential, bro.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.768
You're a chauffeur,
not a priest.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.901
Look, I don't want trouble.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.338
Some of my clients, I'm not
sure they're good people,

20:09.382 --> 20:10.644
but that's not on me.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.950
We get paid to drive people
to airports,

20:12.994 --> 20:14.648
restaurants, Hamptons.

20:14.691 --> 20:15.866
And we get paid
to get a name.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.042
So I'm gonna need one.

20:18.086 --> 20:22.133
Like I just said,
I don't want to get involved.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.135
It's not really
an option now, is it?

20:24.179 --> 20:25.746
Now, we can do this
the easy way,

20:25.789 --> 20:27.226
you give me a name,
or the legal way.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.271
I come back here
in an hour with a subpoena

20:29.315 --> 20:31.795
demanding all books, records,
financial statements,

20:31.839 --> 20:35.103
bank accounts--
- Okay, okay, relax.

20:35.146 --> 20:37.801
I'll get you his damn name.

20:37.845 --> 20:38.976
Thank you.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.808
I never said I was
a choir boy, Frank.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.550
I just come at it
from a different angle.

20:52.686 --> 20:53.904
Mark Sirenko.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.471
Two counts--
one for agg assault,

20:55.515 --> 20:57.125
one for armed robbery.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.822
Anything that suggests this
guy's running underage girls?

20:58.866 --> 21:00.302
No, but he did hire
the car service,

21:00.346 --> 21:02.304
so it's gotta be the same guy
who was chasing Ava--

21:02.348 --> 21:03.914
same height, same build.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.655
I'm starting to think this
guy may be a little more legit

21:05.699 --> 21:08.136
than his résumé suggests.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.833
You sure you want to go at him
like this?

21:09.877 --> 21:11.574
I'm gonna ask him.

21:11.618 --> 21:12.706
I'm gonna look him in the eye.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.055
I'm gonna see
if he's our shooter.

21:16.405 --> 21:18.015
NYPD for Mark Sirenko.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.279
He's out the back.
Follow me, please.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.990
Gentleman,
how can I help you?

21:36.033 --> 21:37.861
We need to talk to you
about something that happened

21:37.905 --> 21:39.515
in Manhattan this morning.

21:39.559 --> 21:40.734
Whatever you need.

21:40.777 --> 21:45.216
A young girl
was shot and killed.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.523
Sorry, I don't know
anything about that.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.482
How about now?

21:49.525 --> 21:51.440
That's a picture of a car.

21:51.484 --> 21:52.833
And a man.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.008
It could be any man.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.792
But it's not.

21:55.836 --> 21:57.359
It's you.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.232
You know, the great thing is
about computers these days?

22:01.276 --> 22:03.887
You type in a few words,
you hit enter,

22:03.931 --> 22:06.890
and it gives you the name
of the guy in the photo.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.371
Listen, I'm a busy man.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.764
You want anything else?

22:10.807 --> 22:12.026
I'm about to have some lunch.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.984
Yeah, I'm gonna
interrupt your midday meal

22:14.028 --> 22:15.551
with a few more questions.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.727
This girl, you recognize her?

22:17.771 --> 22:18.902
I don't think so.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.817
You don't think so?

22:20.861 --> 22:22.602
How about now?

22:22.645 --> 22:24.560
- No.
- No?

22:24.604 --> 22:26.910
You sure about that?

22:26.954 --> 22:29.391
Because that's you
at Chelsea Piers

22:29.435 --> 22:31.306
running after the girl

22:31.350 --> 22:34.265
you just claimed
you don't know.

22:34.309 --> 22:37.791
I'm done talking.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.401
- I'm not done.
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.752
She was 15, 15.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.319
I know you were involved.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.625
You know why?

22:45.668 --> 22:47.670
Because I saw you, I was there.

22:47.714 --> 22:48.758
Yeah.

22:48.802 --> 22:49.933
You hear me?

22:49.977 --> 22:51.108
And I'm coming for you.

22:51.152 --> 22:52.980
Okay, that's enough.

23:05.514 --> 23:06.646
Frank.

23:06.689 --> 23:08.604
Yeah, what's going on?

23:08.648 --> 23:10.345
Have you lost your mind?

23:10.389 --> 23:11.912
Excuse me?

23:11.955 --> 23:13.783
What are you doing
talking to Mark Sirenko,

23:13.827 --> 23:15.045
getting up in his grill?

23:15.089 --> 23:17.134
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
watch your tone with me.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.310
You blew up my case,
you want me to watch my tone?

23:19.354 --> 23:21.269
OC's been working
this prick for six months.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.967
You walk up to his front door,
start asking questions?

23:24.011 --> 23:26.361
You don't de-conflict,
you don't reach out.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.928
Now what do you think
Sirenko is gonna do?

23:27.971 --> 23:29.712
He's gonna close up his biz.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.322
He's gonna stop doing deals.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.933
Look, Stabler, we went fast
'cause we had to.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.630
I'm sorry if I didn't
call every precinct

23:34.674 --> 23:36.066
before I made a move.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.546
There's no need
to call the precinct.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.156
You just check to see if
there's an investigative card.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.462
That's all you gotta do.

23:40.506 --> 23:43.422
The son of a bitch
killed a 15-year-old girl.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.383
Well, I'll make sure
we nail him for that.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.777
In the meantime, you give me
everything you got

23:50.820 --> 23:51.908
and I'll try
and keep you in the loop.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.170
No.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.563
I'm seeing this through
to the end.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.086
I'll keep you in the loop.

23:56.130 --> 23:57.914
Frank, you're not listening
very well right now.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.394
The case is mine.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.138
The case is mine. Back off.

24:07.010 --> 24:09.056
Frank, let it go.

24:09.099 --> 24:12.494
No. I can't.
Not with this one.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.887
Look, I get it.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.192
I need you
to take a deep breath

24:15.236 --> 24:16.846
so I can make some phone calls.

24:27.770 --> 24:30.817
Sirenko's main focus
is drugs and extortion.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.950
He started drug trafficking
a couple years ago.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.996
How close are you
to opening a grand jury?

24:36.039 --> 24:38.433
It's hard to say, but we
have made a lot of progress

24:38.477 --> 24:39.739
in the last couple of months.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.784
My CI caught wind
that Sirenko wants to get

24:41.828 --> 24:44.004
in the fentanyl business,
and that's our new angle.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.136
We're trying to set up
a deal for 10 kilos.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.964
You got a CI on the inside?

24:48.008 --> 24:49.531
Why don't we use him
to solve the murder?

24:49.575 --> 24:53.622
Nope, my CI, too risky,
he's too green.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.190
Besides, our angle
is on the drugs.

24:56.233 --> 24:59.367
I have this kid sniffing
around about a murder,

24:59.410 --> 25:00.803
he's gonna be made
in ten seconds.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.326
We don't have to have him
say a word.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.589
Just plant a wire.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.461
Look, Sirenko and his crew
have been edgy

25:06.505 --> 25:07.854
for a while now,
and your knocking

25:07.897 --> 25:09.203
on their door
didn't help matters.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.944
Now they're paranoid.

25:10.987 --> 25:13.816
With all due respect, we don't
know what the hell's going on,

25:13.860 --> 25:15.688
but they're cooking up
something big.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.212
With all due respect,
this is a murder case.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.822
It trumps a drug case.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.868
I'm not gonna be
looking the other way.

25:21.911 --> 25:24.044
What I'm saying is,
we need to take our time.

25:24.087 --> 25:27.134
We do it your way, you get
Sirenko on the murder beef.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.353
Do it my way, we roll up
the whole damn crew,

25:29.397 --> 25:30.659
all 40 of 'em.

25:30.703 --> 25:34.750
Yeah, I don't have time
for you to build a case.

25:34.794 --> 25:35.969
This one's different.

25:36.012 --> 25:38.667
I was there
when this girl died.

25:38.711 --> 25:39.712
I was talking to her.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.191
I was looking in her eyes.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.019
And this pig Sirenko
put two in her chest

25:43.063 --> 25:44.630
right in front of me.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.416
Her name was Ava.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.592
She was 15, barely.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.209
I'm sorry.

25:59.253 --> 26:00.210
No.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.620
You know, I heard, uh,

26:18.664 --> 26:21.231
I heard Elliot Stabler
was a good cop,

26:21.275 --> 26:23.016
great cop, real police.

26:23.059 --> 26:26.628
He'd do anything to get justice
for a girl like Ava.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.198
I guess I heard wrong.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.164
It's up to you.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.470
What is?

26:42.513 --> 26:44.646
It's your case,
your CI, but--

26:44.690 --> 26:47.736
But what?

26:47.780 --> 26:50.260
Like Frank said,
we're talking about the murder

26:50.304 --> 26:52.045
of a 15-year-old girl.

27:04.405 --> 27:05.580
Vincent here?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.147
He out back.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.497
- He's not, uh--
- The kid's an idiot.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.065
He's taking bets this time.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.255
Get the right up.

27:42.530 --> 27:44.227
Move your feet!

27:46.229 --> 27:49.232
Take him down!

27:50.973 --> 27:53.062
All right, hey. Hey, hey.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.542
Hey, hey.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.718
I got 60 bucks
if you stay down.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.983
Great, all right,
this is it, over.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.724
Fight's over. Let's go.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.204
Come on up. Come on.

28:11.254 --> 28:14.997
Why do you always gotta
pick guys twice your size?

28:15.041 --> 28:17.130
It don't count otherwise.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.915
You gotta embrace
the fear, brother.

28:21.221 --> 28:23.049
What the hell
are you doing here, anyway?

28:23.092 --> 28:24.441
I thought we were gonna leave
the Sirenko thing alone

28:24.485 --> 28:26.226
for a minute.
- We were.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.749
Things have changed.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.490
Is he ready to meet
my fentanyl connect?

28:29.533 --> 28:31.579
No, he killed a kid.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.320
What do you mean a kid?

28:33.363 --> 28:35.714
A kid, Ava Marchenko,
15-year-old girl.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.759
He was trafficking her.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.108
What do you need me to do?

28:41.023 --> 28:42.938
I need you to clone his burner.

28:42.982 --> 28:44.766
So if he texts anyone
about the murder,

28:44.810 --> 28:47.290
just makes a call out,
tries to bury something,

28:47.334 --> 28:49.292
then we'll have him now.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.207
Sirenko is smart.

28:51.251 --> 28:55.734
And he's gonna have security
software on his phone.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.607
So we do
a hand-held clone, then?

28:59.650 --> 29:01.740
Yes.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.437
Done.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.047
Just like that? You sure?

29:05.091 --> 29:07.093
Eh, Sirenko is gonna be
at the club tonight.

29:07.136 --> 29:10.226
I'll swing by, grab a few
drinks, talk up some ladies.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.445
Clone his phone.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.447
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:13.490 --> 29:16.145
Use your head, all right?

29:16.189 --> 29:17.712
Just be smart.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.105
These guys are paranoid
right now,

29:19.148 --> 29:21.629
and so if the opportunity
doesn't present itself,

29:21.672 --> 29:23.457
you're gonna walk.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.111
Walk away.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.986
Where's my 60 bucks?

29:43.303 --> 29:46.045
What's up, baby?

29:46.088 --> 29:48.656
Stay safe.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.049
What happened to your face?

29:50.092 --> 29:51.006
What?

29:51.050 --> 29:52.791
What happened to your face?

29:52.834 --> 29:55.358
Oh, rough sex.

29:57.621 --> 29:58.971
Totally consensual, though.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.162
Hey, how's it going, Mark?

30:20.340 --> 30:22.733
Why is it so packed
in here tonight?

30:22.777 --> 30:24.387
Same reason as always--

30:24.431 --> 30:25.388
hot women.

30:26.912 --> 30:29.088
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.747
Anyone got any cigarettes?

30:36.791 --> 30:38.401
I'm practically shaking.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.627
Oh, come on,
he's not really gonna try

30:46.670 --> 30:48.542
to steal the phone, is he?

30:48.585 --> 30:50.544
Vince, pull back.

30:50.587 --> 30:53.025
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, sorry, all right.

30:53.068 --> 30:54.330
I'm just looking
for cigarettes.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.941
<i>Look, dude, I'm just
dying for a smoke.</i>

30:55.984 --> 30:57.725
Sirenko's not
in the mood for this.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.292
Vince, get out of there.

30:59.335 --> 31:00.336
Just pull back.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.731
Hey, uh,
any chance you and I

31:03.774 --> 31:05.124
can talk a little business
later on?

31:05.167 --> 31:06.386
My guy is getting nervous,

31:06.429 --> 31:07.561
and he thinks
you don't like him.

31:07.604 --> 31:09.824
Not tonight, Vince.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.870
Now, you hear me?

31:11.913 --> 31:14.742
Enjoy yourself.

31:14.785 --> 31:15.961
Have a drink.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.274
I guess that's my cue.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.806
Night, all.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.204
<i>Man, I can clear a room.</i>

31:45.425 --> 31:46.861
Vince, don't do it.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.558
Get the hell out
of the club now.

31:52.954 --> 31:53.999
You gotta be kidding me.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.478
All right,
get patrol on the horn

31:55.522 --> 31:57.437
and get me the excuse to storm
that place if I need to.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.525
Copy that.

32:05.575 --> 32:06.925
I think he's running
out of time, Jet.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.970
Where we at?
- No low-hanging fruit.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.537
Place is up to date
on their liquor license.

32:10.580 --> 32:12.756
No previous 911 calls.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.889
<i>No plates out front
come back as parole violators.</i>

32:14.933 --> 32:16.978
If you go in there,
you're gonna have to wing it.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.066
We could blow Vince's cover.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.833
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

32:45.876 --> 32:47.008
All right, bye.

33:25.438 --> 33:26.961
Hey, man.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.702
What the hell are you
doing back here?

33:28.745 --> 33:32.227
I just wanted to apologize.

33:32.271 --> 33:35.013
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.015
Want to get a drink?

33:37.058 --> 33:38.407
Maybe--maybe later.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.409
Are you following me?

33:40.453 --> 33:42.585
No.
No, I'm not following you.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.290
<i>Hey, we're okay. We're okay.</i>

33:51.333 --> 33:53.857
Don't--don't do anything crazy.

33:53.901 --> 33:54.989
Stay calm.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.382
Calm.

33:56.425 --> 33:58.471
Now you want me
to be calm, huh?

33:58.514 --> 34:00.342
Now how's this, huh?

34:00.386 --> 34:01.778
Calm enough?

34:01.822 --> 34:04.129
Hey, man, I just wanted
to talk some stuff over.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.565
I could come back another time.

34:08.959 --> 34:13.399
You never walk into my office
without an invitation,

34:13.442 --> 34:14.922
you understand?

34:16.489 --> 34:18.404
Do you understand?

34:18.447 --> 34:19.753
Yes.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.758
Okay, I understand.

34:24.801 --> 34:26.934
<i>I'm sorry, like, for real.</i>

34:30.546 --> 34:32.679
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

34:32.722 --> 34:35.377
You remember
what I said, Vincent.

34:35.421 --> 34:37.031
Get out of my office.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.654
Looks like
your CI worked out.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.308
- We'll see. Jet?
- Still downloading.

35:36.351 --> 35:38.484
Where'd you find
this kid, anyway?

35:38.527 --> 35:40.834
About a year ago,
I was driving down 2nd Avenue

35:40.877 --> 35:45.578
and I see this 135-pound kid

35:45.621 --> 35:47.580
beating the snot out
of this 300-pound guy.

35:47.623 --> 35:49.147
I pull over, I pull 'em apart.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.366
I have to call an ambulance
for the 300-pounder.

35:51.410 --> 35:52.672
While we're waiting
for the bus,

35:52.715 --> 35:54.064
I ask the kid, "What the hell
were you doing

35:54.108 --> 35:55.283
lighting the guy up?"

35:55.327 --> 35:57.111
And he says, "I was bored."

35:57.155 --> 35:58.504
Then he asked me for a job.

35:58.547 --> 35:59.853
I don't know what
you're so worried about.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.028
He pulled through.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.290
Well, he's a very smart kid.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.727
And he can obviously
handle himself,

36:04.771 --> 36:06.164
but he's impetuous as hell.

36:06.207 --> 36:08.122
Hey, check it out.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.518
Now, that looks like
a yacht to me.

36:12.561 --> 36:15.390
I told you Sirenko
was paranoid.

36:15.434 --> 36:18.306
He had the camera surveillance
downloaded to his burner.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.091
Look at the timestamp.

36:21.135 --> 36:23.224
This footage is from the day
of the murder.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.357
That girl looks
even younger than Ava.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.794
- Who's that guy?
- We never see his face.

36:27.837 --> 36:29.796
Well, now we know there
were two girls on the boat,

36:29.839 --> 36:32.581
which means we have a witness
who can maybe fill in the blank

36:32.625 --> 36:34.279
and tell us why Ava
ran off the boat.

36:34.322 --> 36:37.325
And why Sirenko killed Ava.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.284
All we gotta do
is find that girl.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.199
I'll start reviewing
missing persons cases,

36:41.242 --> 36:42.374
recent juvenile arrests.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.332
There's a good chance
she's a runaway.

36:44.376 --> 36:47.379
I'll check the footage
from the Chelsea Piers.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.032
If she didn't leave
from that dock...

36:49.076 --> 36:51.644
Then she's definitely
still on that boat.

36:51.687 --> 36:54.255
We tracked the boat
to City Island Marina.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.518
This is the young girl,
potential witness,

36:56.562 --> 36:57.737
no idea who she is.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.043
And the woman next to her,
also don't know.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.394
We ran her through facial rec,
didn't get a hit.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.396
- Well, that is a tough angle.
- Mm-hmm.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.701
How about now, ring any bells?

37:07.181 --> 37:09.270
Uh, no, I'm sorry.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.620
Shot in the dark,
but we need to find out

37:11.664 --> 37:12.969
who that woman is, and fast.

37:13.013 --> 37:14.580
All right, well, let us
run with this, Elliot.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.538
Look, if she's the pimp and
she's cut from the same cloth

37:16.582 --> 37:18.758
as every other female pimp,
it's a good chance

37:18.801 --> 37:21.456
that she's gonna have priors
for promoting prostitution.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.982
Thanks, Liv.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.375
Okay, guys, listen up.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.986
I want it all,
faces of the nation.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.597
Get me through
to the CHRIS system.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.728
We run juvie.

37:32.772 --> 37:35.165
We run halfway home rosters.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.515
I want to touch base
with the Feds.

37:36.558 --> 37:39.126
Any system that
we have access to,

37:39.169 --> 37:40.693
we run it through
to find our mother hen.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.347
And these are the stats
on mother hen.

37:42.390 --> 37:45.393
She's female, white, 35 to 45;
5'5" to 5'7".

37:45.437 --> 37:47.787
She's got light hair,
pale skin, thin build.

37:47.830 --> 37:50.268
And she's gonna have
a connection to New York,

37:50.311 --> 37:54.141
a last known, car registration,
filter for priors.

37:54.184 --> 37:56.622
A woman like this,
she's gonna have 'em.

37:56.665 --> 37:57.971
Victim turned abuser?

37:58.014 --> 37:59.668
You know the story
as well as I do.

37:59.712 --> 38:02.236
Most female pimps
started off as victims.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.196
So again, I want you
to look for all types

38:06.240 --> 38:07.589
of prostitution charges.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.330
And go back to the
beginning on this.

38:09.374 --> 38:10.679
Mother hen might have
gotten charged

38:10.723 --> 38:13.160
when she was 16 or younger.
- Yeah.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.466
I think I got something,

38:14.509 --> 38:16.032
something that threads
the needle.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.165
- Let's have it.
- Name is Sam Ellis.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.210
Her last charge
was five years ago,

38:20.254 --> 38:21.777
promoting prostitution
of a minor.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.171
She was arrested for
solicitation and prostitution

38:24.214 --> 38:25.694
three times before she was 21.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.914
She's 41 years old,
5'6", thin build.

38:27.957 --> 38:31.004
Okay, bring 'em up
side-by-side on the screen.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.750
That looks pretty close to me.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.709
Same build, same mouth.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.624
That's her.
That's our mother hen.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.626
Call Cosgrove,
I'll call Stabler.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.106
We found our pimp.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.206
NYPD!

39:01.208 --> 39:02.340
- Go, go, go!
- Up, up!

39:08.563 --> 39:09.651
Go, go.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.221
Drop your weapon!

39:31.760 --> 39:34.720
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:41.596 --> 39:42.989
No, no, no.
No, no!

39:43.032 --> 39:44.338
No, no! No, no!
Don't shoot!

39:44.382 --> 39:46.079
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

39:46.122 --> 39:47.428
I got you. You're safe.

39:47.472 --> 39:51.214
Drop the knife.
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

39:53.129 --> 39:54.740
Just shoot me.

39:54.783 --> 39:57.307
No, please, just--
just shoot me!

39:57.351 --> 39:59.222
I just--I'd rather die.
Please, no.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.137
Please.

40:01.181 --> 40:02.878
Just please shoot me.
