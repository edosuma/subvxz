I'm going to tear down
and rebuild every family in this town!

19:23.914 --> 19:26.583
Why would you do that?
I love Megan and Danny! They...

19:26.667 --> 19:29.962
Abandoned you!
They don't care about you.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.673
No one cares about their families!

19:32.756 --> 19:34.967
Everyone just wants stuff!

19:35.050 --> 19:37.427
I'm going to give them something better.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.762
Throw the switch!

19:42.182 --> 19:43.559
(YELPING)

19:43.642 --> 19:45.602
No!

19:49.940 --> 19:51.650
-(GRUNTING)
-Megan?

19:51.733 --> 19:52.943
You came back for me!

19:53.026 --> 19:56.029
Oh, honey, you're the only
holiday present I need.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.408
Gingerbread!

20:00.784 --> 20:03.453
-(POWERS DOWN)
-The jig's up, Santa!

20:03.579 --> 20:04.663
"Santa"?

20:04.746 --> 20:08.000
You think Santa could build
an army of gingerbread elves? (LAUGHS)

20:09.626 --> 20:11.128
(ELVES SHRIEKING)

20:11.211 --> 20:12.379
Wha...

20:12.462 --> 20:15.215
I made gingerbread
the flavor of the season.

20:15.299 --> 20:17.134
<i>I made gingerbread</i>
<i>the official sponsor</i>

20:17.217 --> 20:18.594
<i>of the Shop-A-Lympic Mega-Sale.</i>

20:18.677 --> 20:20.762
<i>I made people trust the brand...</i>

20:20.846 --> 20:23.182
Wait, are you the Bread Baron?

20:23.265 --> 20:24.725
See, he's a nemesis of ours.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.560
Ever see the Old Man Duck Head video?

20:26.643 --> 20:27.895
Long story, anyway...

20:27.978 --> 20:30.105
-Are you?
-What? No!

20:30.189 --> 20:34.276
-Phew.
-I'm the Bread Baroness!

20:34.359 --> 20:36.028
-(CACKLING)
-Huh?

20:36.111 --> 20:37.821
She's got gingerbread
for a head. (LAUGHS)

20:37.905 --> 20:39.364
Indeed!

20:39.448 --> 20:44.328
My ex-husband Bread Baron failed
because he thought too small!

20:44.411 --> 20:49.333
He thought gingerbread wasn't a real bread
and left me for a little French croissant.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.251
But I don't need him.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.587
Or anyone else! (CACKLES)

20:53.670 --> 20:56.465
Whoa, 'cause your marriage collapsed,

20:56.548 --> 20:59.676
you're, like, really lonely, huh?

20:59.760 --> 21:01.637
I'm sorry, man, that's a bummer.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.806
No, I'm just... You're wrong!

21:04.890 --> 21:06.934
I'm doing the world a favor!

21:07.017 --> 21:09.436
They'll be glad to have
new, better families.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.438
Families you can eat, if they upset you!

21:11.522 --> 21:12.940
-(ELVES GROWLING)
-(CACKLING)

21:13.023 --> 21:15.651
No! There's no replacement for family!

21:15.734 --> 21:19.488
And the holiday is about taking the time
to show them you love them,

21:19.571 --> 21:21.323
-flaws and all!
-Huh?

21:21.406 --> 21:24.785
Dad!
We could never have a holiday without you!

21:24.868 --> 21:26.995
(SIGHS) I love you guys so much.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.289
Aw, I love you guys, too.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.250
Let me in on some of that huggin'.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.001
Now let's break some bread!

21:33.085 --> 21:34.670
You, uh...

21:34.753 --> 21:35.838
Suckers!

21:35.921 --> 21:37.798

21:52.896 --> 21:55.357
Mmm, old holiday tradition,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.526

21:57.609 --> 22:00.028
