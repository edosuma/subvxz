WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:02.960
The following programme
contains strong language.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.000
Hey.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.240
Hey.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.880
Agnes, right?

00:49.920 --> 00:51.880
Massimo Ruggero.
Yeah.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.000
You found him?

00:56.000 --> 00:56.160
You found him?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.560
What a bloody stupid thing to do.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.520
I should have guessed
he'd do something like this.

01:03.560 --> 01:04.000
The work was Damian's life.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.080
The work was Damian's life.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.440
The police called you?
They didn't know who else to call.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.000
Outside of Kalim,
he didn't even have friends.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.080
Outside of Kalim,
he didn't even have friends.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.160
And now they're both gone.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.120
How come you're here anyway?

02:22.680 --> 02:24.000
Fuck off!

02:24.000 --> 02:24.040
Fuck off!

02:32.360 --> 02:34.320
Oh, Jesus.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.360
Oh, fuck.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.080
I will not tolerate another
embarrassment like Hinkley Point.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.680
I understand.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.000
Hi, you wanted to see me?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Hi, you wanted to see me?

03:55.200 --> 03:58.160
I asked you both to prioritize
the acquisition of companies

03:58.200 --> 04:00.000
in gaming, data analysis
and artificial intelligence.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.240
in gaming, data analysis
and artificial intelligence.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.280
We have.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.520
It takes time.
You don't have time.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.440
Does our new Chief Strategy Officer
have something to add?

04:11.480 --> 04:13.760
We should be targeting 5G.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.000
I mean, it's the highway all data
will run on and it's coming fast.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.360
I mean, it's the highway all data
will run on and it's coming fast.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.160
And I'm sure Massimo
will already be across it.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.920
Is Massimo the one
who told you this?

04:23.760 --> 04:24.000
Of course not.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.920
Of course not.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.360
My loyalty is to NYL.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.320
Then you indulge me.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.280
In what way?

04:38.760 --> 04:40.000
Please call Eleanor Bourg
and have her join us.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.120
Please call Eleanor Bourg
and have her join us.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.000
Then I'll be in touch.
Thank you.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.000
Those investors who
were just here...

05:04.000 --> 05:05.160
Those investors who
were just here...

05:05.200 --> 05:07.720
I'm meeting with their
CEO on Sunday.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.040
I would like for you to be there.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.080
No.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.920
No?
It's my confirmation.

05:16.960 --> 05:17.960
Already?

05:19.120 --> 05:20.000
I would like to...
Massimo, do you have a moment?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.800
I would like to...
Massimo, do you have a moment?

05:25.040 --> 05:27.000
Don't worry about Sunday.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.000
Sure.

05:28.000 --> 05:28.360
Sure.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.600
Let's talk in my office.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.000
You look tired.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.400
You look tired.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.640
Are you sleeping?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.240
Damian Curtis is dead.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.840
The Tellers polling expert.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.000
I found his body last night.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.320
I found his body last night.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.320
Kalim had a place in the country.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.600
I was picking up
some stuff for his wife.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.360
Right.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.400
Jesus...

06:06.800 --> 06:08.000
The police said it was suicide.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.520
The police said it was suicide.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.760
So sorry.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.520
What can I do to help you?

06:17.760 --> 06:19.800
The spyware you have at NYL.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.680
Can it access Liwei's files?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.720
What would you be looking for?

06:31.120 --> 06:32.000
We're on the same team now.
Right, Massimo?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.080
We're on the same team now.
Right, Massimo?

06:36.680 --> 06:37.880
Yes.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.000
Just before he died,
Kalim sent this text.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.640
Just before he died,
Kalim sent this text.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.120
What does this mean?
Liwei's files might tell us.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.160
I'll get you the access.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.240
Thank you.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.240
You wanted to see me?

07:33.840 --> 07:35.200
Eleanor, we know everything.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.520
You played games with
Pietro Marchesi over Flamestar

07:39.560 --> 07:42.720
and you helped Massimo
screw us on Hinkley Point.

07:42.760 --> 07:43.800
Oliver...

07:43.840 --> 07:44.000
Don't deny it, El,
you'll just make it worse.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.200
Don't deny it, El,
you'll just make it worse.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.720
How could it get any worse?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.080
Under the circumstances,

07:57.120 --> 07:59.360
NYL has decided to press
criminal charges.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.000
Not now, Chris.
This can't wait, I'm afraid.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.360
Not now, Chris.
This can't wait, I'm afraid.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.040
Zhi.
Yeah.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.000
We may be wrong about Eleanor.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.360
We may be wrong about Eleanor.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.400
These men just completed a sweep
of our computer systems.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.120
They're infected with spyware.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.000
Some kind of keylogger, apparently.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.600
Some kind of keylogger, apparently.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.960
They've been monitoring everything.
Who is "they"?

08:36.160 --> 08:39.440
It's impossible
to say for sure, but I guess...

08:39.480 --> 08:40.000
Dominic Morgan.
In that case, he wouldn't have

08:40.000 --> 08:41.800
Dominic Morgan.
In that case, he wouldn't have

08:41.840 --> 08:44.120
needed Eleanor to tank Flamestar
and Hinkley Point.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.000
Are you working on 5G?
Yes.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.760
Are you working on 5G?
Yes.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.760
Then stop, something more important
has come up.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.840
Satoshi Nakamoto.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.000
The Bitcoin guy?
The mysterious programmer

09:04.000 --> 09:04.560
The Bitcoin guy?
The mysterious programmer

09:04.600 --> 09:07.600
who invented the world's
most powerful digital currency.

09:07.640 --> 09:11.480
He disappeared after that e-mail,
"I've moved on to other things".

09:11.520 --> 09:12.000
Somebody put that fictitious name.
I'm not involved in Bitcoin.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.920
Somebody put that fictitious name.
I'm not involved in Bitcoin.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.920
Who created Bitcoin?

09:16.960 --> 09:19.080
The world
does have a right to know...

09:19.120 --> 09:20.000
So, what? You found him?
Take a look.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.880
So, what? You found him?
Take a look.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.000
This Charles Edwards just left
Warrens Bank before the accident.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.920
This Charles Edwards just left
Warrens Bank before the accident.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.600
They found a key-code.
Key-code to what?

09:33.640 --> 09:36.000
I'm guessing
Nakamoto's Bitcoin fortune.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.360
I'm guessing
Nakamoto's Bitcoin fortune.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.920
Nakamoto disappeared leaving 73
billion dollars in Bitcoin holdings

09:39.960 --> 09:43.800
he can't touch
without revealing his identity.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.000
Bitcoin is China's kryptonite.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.200
Bitcoin is China's kryptonite.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.640
A controlled economy
can be brought to its knees

09:48.680 --> 09:51.240
by an uncontrolled currency.
They find Nakamoto,

09:51.280 --> 09:52.000
they're going to force him to crash
the market destroying Bitcoin.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.760
they're going to force him to crash
the market destroying Bitcoin.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.760
So we find him first and then what?

09:59.800 --> 10:00.000
Nakamoto's a revolutionary
anarchist. He hates everything we
stand for.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Nakamoto's a revolutionary
anarchist. He hates everything we
stand for.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.960
We have a common enemy.
That's not enough.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.960
We're going to need
some kind of a carrot.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.240
Dig it up, but do it fast,

10:09.280 --> 10:12.120
because the spyware at NYL
was disabled 20 minutes ago.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.280
Hey.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.000
They're not going to press charges.
And I should thank you for that?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.760
They're not going to press charges.
And I should thank you for that?

10:26.720 --> 10:28.520
What happened in there?

10:28.560 --> 10:32.000
He needed to know I was on side.
Wow.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.160
You really showed him.

10:34.200 --> 10:39.120
I was helping Massimo who wants
justice for our friend Kalim.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.000
I told you Massimo's paranoid.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I told you Massimo's paranoid.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.640
The Chinese had nothing to do
with Kalim's death.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.560
Massimo betrayed Kalim.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.000
He screwed me over by stopping me
getting the Durings job

10:48.000 --> 10:49.160
He screwed me over by stopping me
getting the Durings job

10:49.200 --> 10:50.800
and you betrayed me, Eleanor.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.000
You went behind my back
to tank Hinkley Point.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.000
Mr Ruggero,
can I help with something?

11:20.000 --> 11:20.680
Mr Ruggero,
can I help with something?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.000
Possibly.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.280
Possibly.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.240
What do you know
about Satoshi Nakamoto?

11:32.280 --> 11:34.080
Nakamoto, he...

11:34.120 --> 11:36.000
If he's a "he",
he's a mathematical genius.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.920
If he's a "he",
he's a mathematical genius.

11:37.960 --> 11:38.960
Like you, then.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.560
And what does
a mathematical genius want?

11:43.600 --> 11:44.000
Nakamoto wants anonymity.
Besides that?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.400
Nakamoto wants anonymity.
Besides that?

11:48.280 --> 11:49.280
Nothing.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.360
Okay.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.600
Then what does he need?

11:58.120 --> 12:00.000
Do you want to help?
Answer that question.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.800
Do you want to help?
Answer that question.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Thank you.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.440
Here you go, ladies.

12:14.760 --> 12:15.920
Thank you.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.800
Fuck.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.400
Let me help you.

12:26.280 --> 12:27.280
Thanks.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.360
What you did was wrong.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.000
I don't need another scolding.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.480
I don't need another scolding.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.280
But you outwitted us all.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.160
I underestimated you.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
I resented you getting the job
I thought I deserved.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.680
I resented you getting the job
I thought I deserved.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.320
You didn't betray NYL to hurt me.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.400
You acted out of loyalty to Massimo.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.200
You got Liwei to drop the charges.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.960
We found a spyware in the computer
systems, he had no case.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.040
And now off you go to Massimo.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.360
Thanks.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.000
Vladimir Putin's Russia Party has
prevailed in parliamentary elections

13:20.000 --> 13:22.280
Vladimir Putin's Russia Party has
prevailed in parliamentary elections

13:22.320 --> 13:26.080
while US polls show Trump and
Clinton neck and neck.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.000
Did you hear Damian Curtis is dead?
I found the body.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.440
Did you hear Damian Curtis is dead?
I found the body.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.760
If that was suicide,
I'm Li Ka-shing.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.000
I need to look again at the data
from the night Kalim died.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.160
I need to look again at the data
from the night Kalim died.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.840
What for?
Something we missed.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.880
Good morning.
Good morning sir.

14:07.920 --> 14:08.000
Is there a manager I can talk to?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.520
Is there a manager I can talk to?

14:12.960 --> 14:14.600
Sorry to keep you waiting, I...

14:24.800 --> 14:25.880
Paul McGinnan.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.480
How are you?

14:29.520 --> 14:30.640
Better for seeing you.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.640
I started to believe

14:33.680 --> 14:37.560
in the whole "what goes around
comes around" karma bullshit.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.000
You heard I left NYL then?

14:40.000 --> 14:40.800
You heard I left NYL then?

14:40.840 --> 14:43.240
"I left" being a euphemism
for "fired"? Sure.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.120
Seems you really landed on your feet
with Dominic Morgan.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.000
You two deserve each other.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.040
You two deserve each other.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.360
So, what can I do for you?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.680
Actually, you know what? Forget it.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.000
Oh, come on!

14:56.000 --> 14:56.440
Oh, come on!

14:56.480 --> 14:58.280
You won't let me tell you
where to stick

14:58.320 --> 14:59.960
whatever favour you came here for?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.920
That's a real shame.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.000
It's been great catching up, Paul.
We must do it again some time.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.320
It's been great catching up, Paul.
We must do it again some time.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.480
Let's not.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.000
I don't understand why!
Mr Edwards and I...

15:12.000 --> 15:12.320
I don't understand why!
Mr Edwards and I...

15:12.360 --> 15:16.680
Mr Edwards and I
work for the same organization.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.360
The account is in his name,
not the organization's.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.000
There needs to be a list
of the co-lessor,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.200
There needs to be a list
of the co-lessor,

15:21.240 --> 15:24.120
of someone else who's authorized...
It's in his name only.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.640
Unless you have a power of attorney
or an affidavit,

15:26.680 --> 15:28.000
I can't give you access.
It is ridiculous!

15:28.000 --> 15:28.600
I can't give you access.
It is ridiculous!

15:28.640 --> 15:30.640
I'm the acting director
of this organization.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.480
I'd like to speak
with your superior.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.960
If you could please call him.
Sure.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
He'll tell you the exact same thing.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.960
He'll tell you the exact same thing.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.960
Jeffrey?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.320
Quick word, mate.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.000
Zhi, you got a sec?
Yeah.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.640
Look, you should know the reason
Massimo and Eleanor betrayed NYL.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.160
Massimo thinks Liwei
was involved in Kalim's death.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.320
He thinks Kalim uncovered

16:14.360 --> 16:16.000
some kind of secret Chinese
surveillance program.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.520
some kind of secret Chinese
surveillance program.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.040
Okay, Liwei is a patriot,

16:19.080 --> 16:21.320
but he would never be
a party to murder.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.000
Look, I'm with you, 100%.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.360
Look, I'm with you, 100%.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.640
I just thought you should
understand their motivation.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.680
Why?

16:30.680 --> 16:31.960
I guess I could use an ally.

16:36.320 --> 16:37.520
I appreciate it.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.400
Jeremy.

16:47.680 --> 16:48.000
Thank you for dropping by.
My car is waiting.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.320
Thank you for dropping by.
My car is waiting.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.040
You said it was important.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.000
Dominic Morgan is proving
a problem for NYL.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.320
Dominic Morgan is proving
a problem for NYL.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.880
I need you to contain him.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.520
There is nothing
I can do as Global CEO

17:01.560 --> 17:04.000
that you can't do as CEO in London.
You're the head of the 13th floor.

17:04.000 --> 17:04.720
that you can't do as CEO in London.
You're the head of the 13th floor.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.720
I can't help you.
"Can't" or "won't"?

17:09.040 --> 17:11.680
With one hand your bank profits
from Chinese investment,

17:11.720 --> 17:12.000
with the other you let Dominic free
to wall off data for the West.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.200
with the other you let Dominic free
to wall off data for the West.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.480
You can't have it both ways.
Well...

17:18.520 --> 17:20.000
It seems that right now I can.

17:20.000 --> 17:20.040
It seems that right now I can.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.160
Anything else?

17:23.200 --> 17:26.960
If you don't stop him,
you will pay for it.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Personally.

17:28.000 --> 17:28.120
Personally.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.360
And who will make me
pay the price personally?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.360
You?

17:39.680 --> 17:42.640
Dominic doesn't just see
China as the problem.

17:43.880 --> 17:44.000
It's everyone who continues
to support Chinamerica.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.480
It's everyone who continues
to support Chinamerica.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.760
Thanks for the warning.

17:48.840 --> 17:52.000
But while you might not know
how to handle Dominic Morgan, I do.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.080
But while you might not know
how to handle Dominic Morgan, I do.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.480
Have a good day.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.160
You saw this?

18:12.560 --> 18:15.000
Have you spoken to Massimo?

18:15.040 --> 18:16.000
Yes, he thinks
the Chinese had him killed.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.680
Yes, he thinks
the Chinese had him killed.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.400
Same as Kalim.
They probably did.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.680
You should tell him
to tread carefully.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.120
This is a dangerous game, Rebecca.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.000
It's not only Massimo
who needs to watch his step.

18:32.000 --> 18:32.880
It's not only Massimo
who needs to watch his step.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.880
You're right.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.800
We all have to be careful.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.920
Stop looking so worried, Dominic.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.840
If you've found Nakamoto,
it's game over.

18:46.880 --> 18:47.880
Isn't it?

19:16.240 --> 19:20.000
Jess, I want you to look at wireless
carriers, Matt at components.

19:20.000 --> 19:20.720
Jess, I want you to look at wireless
carriers, Matt at components.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.840
Sorry, just a sec.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.160
Paul?
I'm downstairs, you have a minute?

19:26.200 --> 19:27.840
I'll meet you opposite the tube.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.760
Alright.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.200
There he is!

19:39.240 --> 19:41.640
How's it going, mate?
Yeah, I'm not your mate.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.000
Come on, you're just grumpy about
the job at Durings. Shame that.

19:44.000 --> 19:44.680
Come on, you're just grumpy about
the job at Durings. Shame that.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.480
How do you know about that?

19:47.520 --> 19:50.680
One of the students
you took an exam for dobbed you in.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.000
It's the one
at Head of Trading himself.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.760
It's the one
at Head of Trading himself.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.080
I'm really busy right now.
I think you want to hear this.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.000
Your former boss, Massimo Ruggero,
was in my office this morning.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.920
Your former boss, Massimo Ruggero,
was in my office this morning.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.160
Why are you telling me?

20:04.200 --> 20:07.320
Because I think NYL knowing
he was there, might piss him off.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.000
And that
would really brighten my day.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.600
And that
would really brighten my day.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.040
What was he doing there?

20:15.760 --> 20:16.000
Asking about a dead man
called Charles Edwards.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.600
Asking about a dead man
called Charles Edwards.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.160
Everything okay?

20:38.200 --> 20:40.000
Charles Edwards was killed
in a road accident this morning.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.880
Charles Edwards was killed
in a road accident this morning.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.920
Had a security box over at Warrens.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.920
Massimo was asking questions.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.000
It doesn't ring any bells,
but if Massimo's interested, then...

20:48.000 --> 20:50.840
It doesn't ring any bells,
but if Massimo's interested, then...

20:50.880 --> 20:52.360
Exactly.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.680
Let me know what you find.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.800
Hey.
Hey.

20:59.840 --> 21:01.680
I wasn't sure you
were going to come.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.000
Neither was I.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.600
Neither was I.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.160
Well, I'm glad you did. I wanted to
talk to you about something.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.280
Yeah, me too.

21:11.600 --> 21:12.000
About Liwei.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.600
About Liwei.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.280
Okay, he had nothing to do
with Kalim's death.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.000
Or Damian Curtis'?
What?

21:20.000 --> 21:20.480
Or Damian Curtis'?
What?

21:21.960 --> 21:23.600
I found him dead last night.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.640
A suicide.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.000
First Kalim, now Damian.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.160
First Kalim, now Damian.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.640
Quite a coincidence.

21:29.680 --> 21:32.600
Massimo, you couldn't be more wrong
about Liwei.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.840
He would never stand
for anyone being killed.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.000
You can trust me.
That's a hard ask.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.240
You can trust me.
That's a hard ask.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.600
When I don't know
if you're part of this.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.080
You can't believe that.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.200
Tell me you know nothing
about a secret surveillance program.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.160
So much for trust.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.000
Even if such a thing existed,
even if Kalim knew about it,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.480
Even if such a thing existed,
even if Kalim knew about it,

22:01.520 --> 22:03.760
how would Damian Curtis be involved?

22:03.800 --> 22:06.280
It doesn't make any sense!
Yeah, maybe not to you.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.360
What did you want to tell me?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.000
Nothing.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.160
Nothing.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.400
Good.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.000
Hey, babe.
Hey, how was work?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.680
Hey, babe.
Hey, how was work?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.400
Ah, you know...

22:44.440 --> 22:47.240
There is something
you could help me with, actually.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.000
I need to find out about a guy
who was killed in an accident.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.640
I need to find out about a guy
who was killed in an accident.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.880
Apparently,
he was taken to St. Thomas'.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.000
I know you wouldn't ask me
to access hospital records,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.240
I know you wouldn't ask me
to access hospital records,

22:57.280 --> 22:59.800
because that would be unethical.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.080
And there was me thinking

23:02.120 --> 23:04.000
a key member of the senior
nursing team could access all areas.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.640
a key member of the senior
nursing team could access all areas.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.040
Mr Harris...

23:09.080 --> 23:12.000
Are you asking me to shed
my clothes or my ethics?

23:12.000 --> 23:12.960
Are you asking me to shed
my clothes or my ethics?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.640
You know, one of those things
is not happening, right?

23:18.840 --> 23:20.000
I got it.
No, it's fine, I'll be back.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.680
I got it.
No, it's fine, I'll be back.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.000
I'll do it.
Coming!

23:28.000 --> 23:29.960
I'll do it.
Coming!

23:50.840 --> 23:52.000
Mind the gap.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.280
Mind the gap.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.200
I found something.
Mind the gap.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.720
What's this?

24:18.760 --> 24:22.840
Cell tower pings off Kalim's phone
the night he died.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.000
Cutting through backstreets,
doubling back on himself.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.720
Cutting through backstreets,
doubling back on himself.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.280
He knew he was being followed.
Bingo.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.000
What about the woman in the bank?

24:32.000 --> 24:32.440
What about the woman in the bank?

24:33.520 --> 24:36.400
Gail Jackson.
She hardly has an online presence.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.800
Works at the Thorn Foundation,

24:37.840 --> 24:40.000
started by her father
William Jackson.

24:40.000 --> 24:40.520
started by her father
William Jackson.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.520
There's zip on him,
not even a photograph.

24:44.760 --> 24:45.760
Okay.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.880
Margaret.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.000
Be sealed
with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

25:12.000 --> 25:12.560
Be sealed
with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.720
Peace be with you.

25:19.920 --> 25:20.000
Lisa.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.040
Lisa.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.240
Be sealed
with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.280
Amen.
Peace be with you.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.480
Jane.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.840
Be sealed
with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.000
Amen.
Peace be with you.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.600
Amen.
Peace be with you.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.120
James.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.000
Be sealed
with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

25:44.000 --> 25:44.800
Be sealed
with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.600
Amen.
Peace be with you.

25:51.640 --> 25:52.000
Nadya.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.640
Nadya.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.800
Viola.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.840
Be sealed
with the gift of the Holy Spirit.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.000
Amen.
Peace be with you.

26:00.000 --> 26:00.840
Amen.
Peace be with you.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.120
Nadya.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.000
Be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.160
Be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.600
Amen.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.800
Peace be with you.
And with you.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.120
Interesting.

26:38.960 --> 26:39.960
Why come to me?

26:43.200 --> 26:45.880
You're an expert on
cryptocurrencies.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.000
You're here because you tried
to profit from them.

26:48.000 --> 26:48.640
You're here because you tried
to profit from them.

26:48.680 --> 26:52.200
Yes, and because of you.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.880
I have no reason to help you.

26:57.080 --> 26:59.880
Much as you dislike me,
you admire Nakamoto.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.000
You wouldn't want the Chinese
to get to him.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.520
You wouldn't want the Chinese
to get to him.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.280
You know what they would do to him.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.960
One fact is known
about your Ms Jackson.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
She works at something called
the Thorn Foundation.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.680
She works at something called
the Thorn Foundation.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.960
The Thorn Foundation's logo...

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
It looks like this.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.120
It looks like this.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.200
Eight thorns.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.280
In his last e-mail,
Nakamoto said that...

27:47.320 --> 27:49.880
he was moving onto other things.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.000
Other things...
other things.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.480
Other things...
other things.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.000
Bravo.

28:16.000 --> 28:16.800
Bravo.

28:19.760 --> 28:23.320
Even if you find Nakamoto,
he'll never talk to you.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.080
I'm proud of you.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.600
I didn't think you'd come.
Your milk.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.840
You still have the tag
on your blouse.

28:55.760 --> 28:56.000
So I can take it back.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.200
So I can take it back.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.000
You're looking for Satoshi Nakamoto,
aren't you?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.920
You're looking for Satoshi Nakamoto,
aren't you?

29:07.160 --> 29:10.360
Where did you get that idea?
Mr Ruggero asked me about him.

29:13.480 --> 29:17.920
People say Bitcoin is the first step
towards democratizing finance.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.000
Is that so?

29:20.000 --> 29:20.240
Is that so?

29:20.280 --> 29:23.680
They say one day big investors
like you will be destroyed,

29:23.720 --> 29:26.880
creating more opportunity
for everyone.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.720
And who are the people
that are saying that?

29:31.760 --> 29:32.800
On Flamestar.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.760
Well, I wouldn't put too much stock
into what they have to say.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.680
Hello. Excuse me.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.000
Yes, okay.

29:44.000 --> 29:44.720
Yes, okay.

29:46.840 --> 29:47.840
Yes.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.520
Okay, go ahead.

29:53.760 --> 29:59.000
You found him?
At least his daughter, possibly.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.000
Nakamoto can't access his fortune
without that key-code.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.720
Nakamoto can't access his fortune
without that key-code.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.080
The one that got lost
with Edwards' death.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.000
Do you think he needs money?

30:08.000 --> 30:08.440
Do you think he needs money?

30:10.320 --> 30:12.360
I think
he needs someone he can trust.

30:16.520 --> 30:17.880
I thought you should know.

30:17.920 --> 30:20.160
Massimo's interested in this man,
Edwards.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.000
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.040
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.920
But I'm well aware of Mr Edwards.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.520
You are?

30:31.560 --> 30:32.000
Then why is Massimo
so interested in him?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.760
Then why is Massimo
so interested in him?

30:33.800 --> 30:37.320
Because he thinks this might lead
him to Satoshi Nakamoto.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.560
That would be huge.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.280
The matter is in hand.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.640
Have you seen Zhi this morning?

30:52.360 --> 30:54.600
I've been getting cramps.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.000
Any bleeding or spotting?
Nu-uh.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.040
Any bleeding or spotting?
Nu-uh.

30:58.080 --> 31:02.240
This is your first pregnancy,
it's pretty common as the womb
grows.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.000
Are you alright?

31:04.000 --> 31:04.280
Are you alright?

31:06.640 --> 31:08.320
I...

31:08.360 --> 31:11.440
I was considering a termination.

31:11.480 --> 31:12.000
Do you have anyone
to help you make that decision?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.240
Do you have anyone
to help you make that decision?

31:14.280 --> 31:15.480
The father?

31:17.280 --> 31:18.680
It's complicated.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.840
Family?

31:22.880 --> 31:26.200
No, it's not something I could
discuss with my parents about.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.000
You can get advice from your doctor,

31:28.000 --> 31:29.840
You can get advice from your doctor,

31:29.880 --> 31:31.920
if you want to talk through
the options.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.760
Zhi! How are you?

31:47.800 --> 31:49.280
Fine!

31:49.320 --> 31:51.680
Fine, I was just visiting a friend.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.080
I'm really sorry,
but I'm running late.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.080
Yeah, take care.
You too.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.280
Mr Ruggero.
How are you?

32:23.320 --> 32:24.000
Well, thank you. How are you?

32:24.000 --> 32:24.800
Well, thank you. How are you?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.480
Please.
Thank you.

32:30.760 --> 32:32.000
Your secretary said we'd met before.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.040
Your secretary said we'd met before.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.400
No, not exactly.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.240
I saw you at Warrens.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.640
I don't understand.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.160
Then let me get to the chase.
Please do.

32:44.200 --> 32:48.000
I think Mr Edwards
was a courier for your father.

32:48.000 --> 32:48.160
I think Mr Edwards
was a courier for your father.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.760
Satoshi Nakamoto.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.800
My father is William Jackson.

32:57.840 --> 33:01.640
Do I look Japanese to you?
You wouldn't have to.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.760
And you know that.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.800
My father is a recluse,

33:05.840 --> 33:09.880
but I can assure you he's not
this Nakamoto you're referring to.

33:09.920 --> 33:10.920
Okay.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.320
But he's about to become
a very lucky man.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Ten million pounds.

33:20.000 --> 33:20.480
Ten million pounds.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.000
Is this a joke?
It's a gift.

33:28.000 --> 33:28.400
Is this a joke?
It's a gift.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.280
In exchange for?

33:31.480 --> 33:33.200
The satisfaction of knowing

33:33.240 --> 33:36.000
that your father can afford
to maintain his anonymity and
safety.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.080
that your father can afford
to maintain his anonymity and
safety.

33:38.840 --> 33:41.200
No, I couldn't possibly accept this.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.560
I think you could.

33:49.560 --> 33:50.800
Zhi.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.000
One sec.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.080
One sec.

33:54.160 --> 33:56.600
Liwei was trying to find you.
Thank you.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.400
Do you know what's going on
with Satoshi Nakamoto?

33:59.440 --> 34:00.000
No.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
No.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.920
Apparently Massimo's
looking for him.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.640
He thinks that guy Edwards
was one of his couriers.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.000
No, he didn't say anything to me
about that.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.120
No, he didn't say anything to me
about that.

34:08.160 --> 34:09.440
Did you tell Liwei?

34:10.800 --> 34:12.200
He told me not to do anything.

34:12.240 --> 34:14.160
That's odd.
Right?

34:14.200 --> 34:16.000
When did you speak to Massimo?
Two days ago.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.360
When did you speak to Massimo?
Two days ago.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.240
And you were right
about his paranoia.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.240
He thinks Liwei
had Damian Curtis killed as well.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.000
I didn't even know Damian was dead.
Yeah, apparently it was a suicide.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.440
I didn't even know Damian was dead.
Yeah, apparently it was a suicide.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.840
That's awful.
Yeah.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.000
Good morning, Eleanor Bourg for MAI.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Good morning, Eleanor Bourg for MAI.

34:48.680 --> 34:49.760
Nadya, right?

34:54.400 --> 34:55.760
Come in.

34:57.680 --> 34:58.880
Who are you?

34:58.920 --> 35:02.080
Eleanor Bourg,
a friend of Massimo's.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.840
He said you're good.

35:03.880 --> 35:04.000
He did?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.040
He did?

35:06.280 --> 35:08.760
He said: "She reminds me of me."

35:13.200 --> 35:14.640
Eleanor.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.280
Welcome to the firm.
Thank you.

35:17.320 --> 35:20.000
Now look at this.
Dream team back together again.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.080
Now look at this.
Dream team back together again.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.200
I thought she would
have called by now.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.200
It hasn't been that long.
What worries me is NYL.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.000
If this really is Nakamoto,
why isn't Liwei chasing him, too?

35:28.000 --> 35:31.120
If this really is Nakamoto,
why isn't Liwei chasing him, too?

35:50.160 --> 35:51.480
I was looking for you.

35:51.520 --> 35:52.000
Where have you been?

35:52.000 --> 35:53.320
Where have you been?

35:53.360 --> 35:55.320
Something came up.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.840
Oliver told me about Nakamoto.
Did you want me to do anything?

35:58.880 --> 36:00.000
Nothing.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.840
Nothing.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.800
I thought that...
No, leave it.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.720
Please.
Thank you.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.000
Thank you for coming.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.080
Thank you for coming.

36:16.120 --> 36:18.680
I don't understand why
we couldn't do this over the phone.

36:18.720 --> 36:23.120
Do you mind if I ask why you want
Massimo's personal contact details?

36:24.120 --> 36:25.520
Does it matter?

36:25.560 --> 36:29.240
It's just that he's been making
some pretty wild accusations lately.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.680
He doesn't think
Damian killed himself.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
Don't you?
I did, but...

36:39.920 --> 36:40.000
I tried to clean up Damian's files
yesterday from home.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.400
I tried to clean up Damian's files
yesterday from home.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.600
The moment I did,
I got kicked off the network.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.120
When I logged back on,
they were gone.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.160
It was like someone was watching me.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.880
Wait a minute.
It's her.

37:03.920 --> 37:04.000
Can I call you back? Thank you.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.040
Can I call you back? Thank you.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.880
Gail.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.000
Before I go any further,
I want to make one thing clear.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.240
Before I go any further,
I want to make one thing clear.

37:14.600 --> 37:18.240
I'm not saying
my father is this Nakamoto.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.280
Okay.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.000
But he very much
appreciated your gift.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.040
But he very much
appreciated your gift.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.880
He'd like a face to face.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.560
Good.

37:27.680 --> 37:28.000
There's a condition.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.760
There's a condition.

37:30.800 --> 37:34.560
He wants your word
that you'll come alone.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.000
He has it. When?

37:36.000 --> 37:36.960
He has it. When?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.920
Now, Borough Hall.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.840
Got it.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.800
I'm sorry, Exmouth Market, please.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.000
You're sure it's the same program?
100 percent.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
You're sure it's the same program?
100 percent.

38:02.040 --> 38:03.560
The same program as what?

38:05.400 --> 38:08.000
Thanks, Tony, that's all.
Thank you, Ms Sharma.

38:08.000 --> 38:08.360
Thanks, Tony, that's all.
Thank you, Ms Sharma.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.000
I've changed my mind again.

38:16.000 --> 38:16.240
I've changed my mind again.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.960
What?
You were wrong.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.680
I can't talk right now.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.280
Kalim was killed because he knew
what Damian Curtis knew,

39:27.320 --> 39:28.000
but it wasn't Liwei
who gave the order.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.040
but it wasn't Liwei
who gave the order.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.840
Who then?

39:30.880 --> 39:33.040
Dominic Morgan.
Dominic Morgan.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.840
Dominic has no motive.
I'm just dealing in facts, alright?

39:35.880 --> 39:36.000
Our IT team found the same spyware
on Agnes Sharma's laptop

39:36.000 --> 39:39.280
Our IT team found the same spyware
on Agnes Sharma's laptop

39:39.320 --> 39:41.400
that Dominic was using at NYL.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.120
Look, we've got our issues,
but I care about you.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.760
Are you done?
Start seeing things as they are.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.760
I know you're looking
for Satoshi Nakamoto.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.000
If you find him, what do you think
Dominic's going to do to him?

40:00.000 --> 40:02.640
If you find him, what do you think
Dominic's going to do to him?

41:33.160 --> 41:34.160
And?

41:35.520 --> 41:36.000
He wasn't there.

41:36.000 --> 41:36.640
He wasn't there.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.280
Then why call you?

41:41.160 --> 41:42.360
That's a good question.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.000
Well, there goes ten million pounds.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.360
Well, there goes ten million pounds.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.240
Did you get anywhere
with Kalim's code?

41:49.400 --> 41:50.400
Nowhere.

41:53.080 --> 41:54.400
Shame.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.640
Yes.

42:02.800 --> 42:03.800
Gotta work.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.040
Mr Ruggero.
Yes?

42:22.080 --> 42:24.000
Did you figure out
what Nakamoto needed?

42:24.000 --> 42:24.040
Did you figure out
what Nakamoto needed?

42:25.960 --> 42:27.320
I think so.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.200
And what did you do?
I gave it to him.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.600
In exchange for...
Nothing.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.200
Hey, babe.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.520
How's things at the hospital?

42:53.560 --> 42:56.000
This says the last time
I looked into the NHS portal.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.600
This says the last time
I looked into the NHS portal.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.520
Wonders of technology.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.240
Well, it looks like
it was right after I told you

43:02.280 --> 43:04.000
I wouldn't access
those records for you.

43:04.000 --> 43:04.480
I wouldn't access
those records for you.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.840
What?

43:10.880 --> 43:12.000
You're not saying
you think I did it?

43:12.000 --> 43:12.640
You're not saying
you think I did it?

43:12.680 --> 43:13.840
Didn't you?

43:16.200 --> 43:17.200
No.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.640
Hungry?
Yeah, I could eat.

43:27.680 --> 43:28.000
-have ripped through rural
communities outside Los Angeles,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.320
-have ripped through rural
communities outside Los Angeles,

43:30.360 --> 43:34.240
triggering evacuation orders from
more than 80 thousand people.

44:19.640 --> 44:22.560
Cutting through backstreets,
doubling back on himself.

47:44.960 --> 47:48.000
Five million's been paid
into the account that you specified.

47:51.360 --> 47:52.000
It's been interesting
doing business with you.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.760
It's been interesting
doing business with you.

48:02.240 --> 48:03.560
Goodbye, Mr Duval.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.520
Goodbye, Satoshi.
