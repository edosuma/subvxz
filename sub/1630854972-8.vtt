The pencils.

My assistant, Rachel, told me.

He makes you sharpen
all of his pencils

02:49.837 --> 02:50.771

02:50.871 --> 02:52.773
And if one goes shorter
than the others,

02:52.873 --> 02:54.242
you have to fix 'em all.

And if any go below
17 centimeters,

12:32.085 --> 12:33.921
some screaming exegesis
of the left--

12:34.021 --> 12:35.588
Billy! Come on. Come on.

12:36.656 --> 12:37.590
Listen...

12:37.690 --> 12:40.460
We practically raised
our families together.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.464
You remember?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.236
You dropped Julie off
in the morning,

12:49.336 --> 12:51.805
and Lucy would babysit her
all day.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.308
It was nice.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.315
I'm not gonna fire you.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.886
No?

13:05.986 --> 13:06.987
No.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.289
That's not why I called you in.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.125
I-- I called you in here...

13:12.225 --> 13:13.460
I mean, right from the start,

13:13.560 --> 13:16.897
to simply ask you a question.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.835
Which three of these people
would you fire?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.472
Oh!

13:27.707 --> 13:30.310
Well, I sure as shit
ain't gonna do your dirty work.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.287
Did you set up
your keyboard yet?

13:40.553 --> 13:41.654
No.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.891
I'm scared I won't remember
how to play C chord.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.925
Oh, you'll find out.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.359
I will find out.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.062
You know what weirdly
I'm looking forward to most

13:49.162 --> 13:50.663
is an unbroken night's sleep.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.632
Hank gets up several times
in the night

13:52.732 --> 13:55.502
with these phantom urges to pee.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.970
I'm sorry, he gets what?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.639
Like, he needs to pee,
but he can't.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.541
But he has to get up anyway,
just in case.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.014
-Oh, my god.
-What?

14:07.114 --> 14:08.381
That's Catherine Keener.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.084
Yeah, that's her.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.485
Her characters are so unlikable.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.653
Shush.

14:13.753 --> 14:14.721
It's true.

14:15.788 --> 14:16.924
Go say hi.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.225
Shush, shush.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.962
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.063
Hi.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.499
I really love your work.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.467
Thank you.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.801
Appreciate it.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.171
I've seen everything
probably...

14:31.271 --> 14:32.339
probably twice.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.873
Oh, wow.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.408
Really, thank you.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.345
Okay.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.213
Okay, so this is like
a weird thing fan thing.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.015
She wants a photo.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.150
Oh, of course. Sure.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.684
Oh, no, not that, not that.
Uh, I mean, I will.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.053
-I mean--
-But, um, no.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.488
It's just that
my husband and I...

14:48.588 --> 14:49.889
I just think
you'll think this is funny.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.459
Um, every time
your name comes up,

14:52.559 --> 14:53.560
he makes a move on me.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.663
-Oh.
-Yep.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.733
Wow. Well, I guess
he's my fan then.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.669
Actually, it works
for both of us, so.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.906
Yeah.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.575
This is about the time
that I'd...

15:08.675 --> 15:10.877
I'd run out
from a potential psycho.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.045
-Oh, no!
-But you know what?

15:12.145 --> 15:13.180
No, my husband and I

15:13.280 --> 15:14.881
have a similar thing
with Winston Churchill, so.

15:14.982 --> 15:15.882
-Different story.
-Really?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.650
No!

15:17.750 --> 15:19.186
-No.
-I'm so dumb.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.287
Is he here?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.056
Who-- Who?

15:23.156 --> 15:24.491
Your husband.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.725
Oh, right!

15:25.825 --> 15:26.859
Um, no.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.228
He's in Pennsylvania.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.098
I got a really good job here
that I couldn't turn down, so--

15:31.198 --> 15:32.765
but he'll come visit.

15:32.865 --> 15:35.468
Yeah. That's tough, though,
with the long-distance thing.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.505
Oh.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.506
I...

15:39.606 --> 15:41.274
Well, there's my co--

15:41.374 --> 15:43.576
This is my coffee shop,
so I'm sure I'll see you around.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.844
Okay.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.247
You just feel free to drop
my name if you wanna get some.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.715
I will!

15:48.815 --> 15:49.915
Okay.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.151
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.189
Oh, shit.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.390
I forgot the picture.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.127
Hank is never gonna believe me.

16:01.694 --> 16:02.829
I love New York.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.236
Come on. Come on.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.040
Hank.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.342
You're not helping anybody
by drawing this out.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.080
I don't know what to do.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.617
Jesus.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.818
You're a mess.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.922
[Hank, thinking]
What to do, what to do?

16:30.023 --> 16:33.193
There's gotta be
a last-ditch attempt...

16:34.227 --> 16:35.728
...a Hail Mary.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.297
Those never work.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.965
That's why they call them
a Hail Mary.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.967
That lady couldn't throw
to save her life.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.270
But I can.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.672
So here goes.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.341
Ready, fire, aim.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.848
Hey. This is
an impressive place.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.317
It is not.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.818
Well, it makes an impression.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.253
That's the point.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.322
You know, if you get fancy,
everybody sees that.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.191
They're gonna wanna
get fancy, too.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.325
I don't mind this.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.928
Plus, I got
a 30,000-square-foot house.

17:09.028 --> 17:09.929
The thing's so big,

17:10.029 --> 17:10.963
I gotta put maps up

17:11.064 --> 17:13.333
with these signs that say
"you are here".

17:13.433 --> 17:15.102
I got lost in it twice.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.203
What can I do for you fellows?

17:16.303 --> 17:18.305
Uh, we're here to talk to you

17:18.405 --> 17:21.374
about your good pal,
Dickie Pope.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.175
Good pal?

17:23.276 --> 17:24.344
Yeah.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.645
I thought so.

17:25.744 --> 17:26.846
You know, with my name,

17:26.945 --> 17:28.815
it's kinda hard to get into
certain country clubs.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.484
I thought maybe Dickie Pope
would be my way in.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.986
Talk about
a fair-weather friend.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.022
Soon as
that final check cleared,

17:36.123 --> 17:37.957
it was
"Sayonara, Jeffrey Epstein."

17:38.057 --> 17:39.025
[Tony] No!

17:39.126 --> 17:40.827
That seemed like
such a solid friendship.

17:40.927 --> 17:41.961
[Hank] Yeah, I get it.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.231
I mean, you think a guy
who leads a university

17:44.331 --> 17:47.033
would want to be good friends
to the university,

17:47.134 --> 17:48.201
but instead, like...

17:48.301 --> 17:49.969
like you told us,

17:50.069 --> 17:52.672
he plunders ten mil
from just anywhere.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.207
And unfortunately for us,
it's...

17:54.307 --> 17:56.576
as you know...

17:56.676 --> 17:58.278
in the faculty budget.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.452
That seems unlikely.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.188
Well, pretty sure that was it.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.257
He probably just went
and financed the building,

18:10.357 --> 18:11.724
that's how these things go.

18:11.824 --> 18:14.594
There's too many tax incentives
to not just go get a mortgage.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.264
I'm sorry, I'm not trying
to burst your bubble.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.398
It's just...

18:18.498 --> 18:19.432
I really doubt

18:19.532 --> 18:21.334
that there's some secret
ten million out there

18:21.434 --> 18:22.435
that's gonna help ya.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.103
So it was just a loan?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.373
I think
that's the simplest answer.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.407
Now, look--

18:27.507 --> 18:28.575
I mean, if you guys get fired,
call me up.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.009
I'll be the first one
to buy you a beer.

18:30.109 --> 18:30.910
I like you guys.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.111
You know, you're--

18:32.212 --> 18:33.813
you're like, uh... friends.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.649
I don't really have friends.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.153
It's hard when everybody wants
something from you.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.792
Well, maybe you could put in
a good word for us

18:45.892 --> 18:48.595
with your friends on the board.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.397
[Epstein] Sure, fellas.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.398
[Hank] Thanks.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.766
We should be at Nora's bar
by 5:00 PM--

18:53.866 --> 18:55.134
maybe earlier--

18:55.235 --> 18:58.238
so you can stop by and buy us
all the beers you want.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.339
[Epstein] It's a date.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.187
[couple moaning]

19:15.755 --> 19:18.625
This could be every day,
but in a warmer climate.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.661
What is it
with you and Florida?

19:21.761 --> 19:24.797
I like to think of it
as North Cuba.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.366
You know I'm Cuban, right?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.101
Of course.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.475
I'm not going
to Florida, Jacob.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.909
You could stay.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.345
No one's forcing you out.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.946
I cannot.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.948
I just can't work
for that guy, Dickie.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.484
You've always been
too good for this job.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.319
Too soft-hearted.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.687
Maybe.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.657
He just doesn't believe
in public education.

19:50.757 --> 19:51.658
Hmm.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.193
It's perverse
that he has this job.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.262
Mm-hmm.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.563
Doesn't make sense.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.733
What can I do
to get you to leave with me?

20:02.935 --> 20:05.972
What you don't understand
is I actually like it here.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.082
I feel like a teenager
when I'm with you.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.925
[**]

20:35.335 --> 20:36.769
[rapping on glass]

20:39.506 --> 20:40.940
[rapping on glass]

20:43.676 --> 20:45.177
[rapping on glass]

20:51.183 --> 20:53.320
It's good to see your face.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.621
I'm working.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.658
Uh, is there an outlet,
uh, in there that I can use?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.693
I-- I'm trying to hook up
my space heater and my--

21:00.793 --> 21:02.028
and my phone's gonna die.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.030
No.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.098
Okay.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.501
Is there one out here
that I'm missing, or...?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.403
No.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.172
And if there was,
you couldn't use it.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.442
Yeah, I know we have problems.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.909
You know?

21:17.009 --> 21:19.278
But I really, really
wanna work on them.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.347
You cheated on me.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.415
How is that working on problems?

21:22.515 --> 21:24.951
Well, you cheated on me twice.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.118
I was 19,

21:26.218 --> 21:27.687
and you were so stoned
the entire time,

21:27.787 --> 21:29.021
you hardly noticed.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.156
I noticed.

21:31.858 --> 21:32.759
Look, sometimes,

21:32.859 --> 21:33.793
it's hard for me
to bring things up with you

21:33.893 --> 21:35.895
because you get
really angry, or--

21:35.995 --> 21:38.097
or judgmental, like--

21:38.197 --> 21:39.131
like your dad.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.099
I'm not like my dad.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.267
Yeah, no, I know, I know.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.234
I know.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.236
That--
That's why I love you.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.605
But...

21:45.705 --> 21:46.706
you can...

21:46.806 --> 21:47.474
Sometimes,
when I'm saying something,

21:47.574 --> 21:49.576
you know, you can act, um...

21:49.676 --> 21:51.811
-like--
-How could you do this to me?

21:55.081 --> 21:56.215
My parents are splitting up,

21:56.315 --> 21:58.351
and then you go
and you do this to me?

22:00.052 --> 22:02.522
Sometimes, it's scary
to bring up issues with you.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.958
So what if it's scary?

22:06.058 --> 22:07.660
How weak are you?

22:18.571 --> 22:20.440
[Hank, thinking]
Here's a life hack--

22:20.473 --> 22:21.841
ugh--

22:21.874 --> 22:22.975
when you're in the middle
of your worst day,

22:23.876 --> 22:24.644
pick the worst thing
you have to do

22:24.744 --> 22:25.745
and get it done.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.680
I mean, how much further down
can you go?

22:27.780 --> 22:30.282
Oh, here he comes.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.183
Ahem.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.385
Bartow.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.425
Let me guess.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.659
You hated it,

22:39.759 --> 22:42.028
but you gave me a B-plus to keep
my parents off your back.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.162
I hated it.

22:43.262 --> 22:44.431
I gave it an A.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.598
For different reasons, though.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.333
This pacing drives us forward,

22:47.434 --> 22:49.869
and the ideas
rise to the surface slowly...

22:49.969 --> 22:51.003
deftly...

22:51.103 --> 22:52.004
but we never get ahead of it.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.005
This is good.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.173
Do more of this.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.275
I think there's more
to the rest of the story that--

22:56.375 --> 22:57.777
No. No, there isn't.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.145
Just this.

22:59.245 --> 23:01.047
Four excellent sentences.

23:01.147 --> 23:04.050
But most people can't do this.

23:06.252 --> 23:07.654
All right.
Well...

23:07.754 --> 23:09.822
thanks for the A.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.558
Yep.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.294
So you're just not gonna do it?

23:15.394 --> 23:16.429
You're not gonna make a list?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.566
Turns out I'm not a list guy.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.401
If they ask for a collage...

23:22.502 --> 23:24.203
And you think that'll work?

23:24.303 --> 23:25.204
Yeah.

23:25.304 --> 23:26.673
Just get some images,
and words,

23:26.773 --> 23:28.207
and glitter and glue.

23:28.307 --> 23:30.409
No. No, it's not gonna work.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.947
[Billie] Did it get you off?

23:37.016 --> 23:38.350
Excuse me?

23:38.451 --> 23:39.418
Sleeping with the dean.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.588
Did it get you off the list?

23:43.022 --> 23:44.190
I don't know what you mean.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.425
Your shirt's inside out
and you smell like balls.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.994
[Finny] "Yes, this was love,

23:48.094 --> 23:51.063
this ridiculous
bouncing of the buttocks,

23:51.163 --> 23:52.231
and the wilting

23:52.331 --> 23:54.233
of the poor, insignificant,
moist, little penis."

23:54.333 --> 23:55.668
D.H. Lawrence.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.238
Mm. Well, you had me
at bouncing buttocks

23:59.338 --> 24:03.175
and lost me
at moist, white little penis.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.577
He didn't say white.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.578
I just assumed.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.579
Hmm.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.615
So...

24:08.715 --> 24:09.916
what now?

24:10.016 --> 24:12.619
Uh, now we celebrate
the feeling

24:12.719 --> 24:14.921
that comes with a shared defeat.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.924
Maybe we'll finally bond.

24:18.024 --> 24:18.991
Doubtful.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.430
Well...

24:24.531 --> 24:25.632
Drinks at Nora's.

24:25.732 --> 24:26.599
It's on me.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.367
Silver lining.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.302
You should go home
and take a shower.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.272
I got it.
I-- I got it!

24:33.372 --> 24:36.075
No, but in a white wine glass
and it can't be a--

24:41.347 --> 24:43.516
[Hank] Meg.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.653
Hi.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.188
I didn't think
I'd see you here for a while.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.491
Yeah, maybe I need a new bar.

24:53.726 --> 24:56.896
Look...

24:56.996 --> 24:59.298
I don't really
get marriage.

24:59.398 --> 25:01.801
It's not something
that I saw growing up

25:01.901 --> 25:03.670
and it's not
this sacred thing to me.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.304
I just...

25:05.404 --> 25:06.806
I don't get it.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.175
But I didn't seduce Russell.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.777
It's not like
we have feelings for each other.

25:10.877 --> 25:11.844
No feelings?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.145
That's a great guide
for your sex life.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.814
Well, to be honest,

25:14.914 --> 25:17.016
I kinda felt sorry for him.

25:17.116 --> 25:19.518
No one should be allowed
to get married at 22.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.821
That's definitely
for you to decide.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.756
That's the vibe
that I got from him, Hank.

25:23.856 --> 25:24.857
-Not me.
-Oh, yeah?

25:24.957 --> 25:27.994
Well, he's camped out
on my porch right now,

25:28.094 --> 25:29.762
begging her to take him back,

25:29.862 --> 25:31.330
so I'm getting a different vibe.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.699
Shit.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.734
-Excuse me, can I--
-Yeah, just one second.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.303
I'm sorry
that Julie is hurting.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.038
Tell her that I didn't mean
to get in between--

25:39.138 --> 25:41.207
I'm not gonna deliver
your apology for you.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.709
And you're not really
apologizing.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.143
Well, I wasn't trying
to hurt her.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.411
Well, who--
Who were you trying to hurt?

25:59.626 --> 26:01.193
-Now could...?
-Yes.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.294
What do you want?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.362
If it's me,

26:03.462 --> 26:05.197
will you guys visit me
in South Carolina?

26:05.297 --> 26:06.365
-Absolutely not.
-No way.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.800
What's in South Carolina?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.801
[Emma] My sister lives there.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.302
We hate each other,

26:10.402 --> 26:13.539
but she said she'd put me up
for six months, so.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.107
Can I join you?

26:16.308 --> 26:17.243
I'm not interested

26:17.343 --> 26:18.745
in sharing a drink
with management right now.

26:18.845 --> 26:19.912
Well, that's okay,

26:20.012 --> 26:22.782
because I tendered
my resignation an hour ago.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.985
[Billie]
Well, that gets you a drink.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.620
Spanky, get him a beer.

26:32.491 --> 26:33.492
Seriously?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.527
You jumped ship
without a lifeboat?

26:35.628 --> 26:36.562
Practically.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.197
That might have been
a little hyperbole there.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.198
Hmm.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.232
The letter is written.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.567
I just need
to spell check it and stuff.

26:41.668 --> 26:42.669
Definitely spell check it.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.103
There's nothing sadder

26:44.203 --> 26:46.438
than a Ph.D.'s
resignation loiter.

26:46.538 --> 26:47.707
[chuckles]

26:50.342 --> 26:51.678
You two again?

26:51.778 --> 26:53.045
I've known her 25 years,

26:53.145 --> 26:55.547
I still can't predict
the next thing out of her mouth.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.185
Yeah, but you know
it's gonna be about her.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.352
That's okay.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.453
I'm over me.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.661
They wouldn't rent me a moped.

27:09.862 --> 27:10.763
The injustice.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.231
Injustice.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.100
[Hank] Hey, you made it.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.601
Epstein!

27:15.702 --> 27:16.602
Fellas!

27:16.703 --> 27:17.704
[Hank] All right.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.771
Hey, you guys.

27:18.871 --> 27:21.373
Um... English department,
this is Jeffrey Epstein.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.110
Jeffrey Epstein,
this is the English department.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.978
[Epstein]
I'm really sorry, guys,

27:26.078 --> 27:27.379
must be a rough night.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.748
I called my friend on the board

27:28.848 --> 27:31.117
to see if there was
anything he could do.

27:31.217 --> 27:32.218
-He said it's done.
-Wonderful.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.753
[Rourke]
Actually, we haven't heard yet.

27:33.853 --> 27:34.854
Would someone tell us?

27:36.655 --> 27:37.757
All right.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.325
You guys...

27:42.762 --> 27:43.930
Emma...

27:45.231 --> 27:46.132
Finny...

27:46.232 --> 27:47.633
and Billie...

27:58.911 --> 27:59.979
We're hurting right now.

28:00.546 --> 28:01.981
But we're professors.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.250
We don't lay down.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.351
Because we're professors,

28:05.451 --> 28:07.453
and we know
that's grammatically incorrect.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.121
We lie down,

28:09.221 --> 28:10.790
or we stand up,

28:10.890 --> 28:13.125
and we go to my house,

28:13.225 --> 28:14.526
and we party.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.963
Right now.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.164
Carpe diem.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.231
Who's with me?

28:23.102 --> 28:24.336
I have a hot tub.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.705
Dickie Pope
is the worst person I ever met.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.074
And I've met an actual Nazi.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.109
All he cares about is money.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.045
Doesn't care about
bettering public education.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.713
As a matter of fact,
he wants to destroy it.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.649
I... I've heard that
he eats garbage.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.959
This is the saddest
hot tub party I've ever been to.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.761
I've been to one sadder.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.197
What's the deal?

28:51.297 --> 28:52.531
I mean...

28:52.631 --> 28:53.966
why does he wanna
save money so bad?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.367
Is he taking a cut?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.904
I think it's
his weird obsession with MIT.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.538
What are you talking about?

28:59.638 --> 29:01.841
I told you about that.
Didn't I tell you about that?

29:01.941 --> 29:02.842
No.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.243
This guy wants to be
president of an Ivy

29:04.343 --> 29:05.912
like his life depends on it.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.046
MIT's not an Ivy League.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.714
[Hank] Whoa. What about MIT?

29:08.815 --> 29:11.150
What did he say about MIT?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.252
I-- I got in touch
with a head-hunter

29:13.352 --> 29:15.421
who told me
there's a position there--

29:15.521 --> 29:17.256
at the top.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.590
Is that
what Dickie's gunning for?

29:18.690 --> 29:21.327
Is that why the deep cut,
so he can prove himself to them?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.862
-Guys...
-Because that is

29:22.962 --> 29:24.997
a significant infraction

29:25.097 --> 29:27.433
of his fiduciary duties
here at this college.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.268
Look, if you have something
on Dickie Pope,

29:29.368 --> 29:30.736
we want to hear it.

29:30.837 --> 29:33.405
And we'll make it
worth your while.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.841
No, you can't.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.542
You forget,
I'm a billionaire.

29:36.642 --> 29:37.709
I know, I forget, too.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.011
Sometimes,
I wake up and look around--

29:39.111 --> 29:41.013
I go, "Oh, my god."

29:41.113 --> 29:43.082
I will write you a poem.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.884
That's priceless.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.056
Look...

29:50.156 --> 29:51.390
what about the "Q"...

29:51.490 --> 29:52.524
in the building--

29:52.624 --> 29:53.459
in your name?

29:53.559 --> 29:54.460
You-- You never liked that.

29:54.560 --> 29:55.461
That bothered you.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.628
We-- We'll get it taken out.

29:56.728 --> 29:58.464
I don't think you have
the power to do that.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.832
Oh, that was Dickie's thing.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.335
No one else that mattered cared.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.007
That little twerp.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.343
...97...

30:12.879 --> 30:14.513
98...

30:18.217 --> 30:19.251
-Dennis!
-Dick.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.487
Hank, you've entered my office.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.122
Oh, yeah.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.490
That's how I got in. Yeah.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.928
I trust you received my list.

30:29.028 --> 30:29.929
Uh...

30:30.029 --> 30:31.563
might have accidentally
gone to my inbox.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.432
I only read my spam.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.466
Time.

30:34.566 --> 30:35.467
Dennis!

30:35.567 --> 30:36.635
No. Look, um,

30:36.735 --> 30:38.270
I wanna chat with you,
because--

30:38.370 --> 30:40.106
Did you hear the news?

30:41.908 --> 30:45.211
I'm going to be
the new president of MIT.

30:47.947 --> 30:48.814
You are not.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.282
-I'm not?
-No.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.584
How would you know that?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.186
[phone rings]

30:59.959 --> 31:00.960
It was...

31:01.060 --> 31:03.029
It was a tough job to get.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.331
Right?
I had to be devious.

31:05.431 --> 31:06.832
They wanted a--
a clown...

31:06.933 --> 31:07.833
the modern kind,

31:07.934 --> 31:09.101
you know,
that kills with glee.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.003
So, first,
I had to go to clown college.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.504
I have work to do.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.974
-You can go.
-You can go.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.375
It's my office.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.843
Except...

31:17.944 --> 31:19.145
it's not.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.746
[phone rings]

31:23.950 --> 31:24.850
Yes?

31:24.951 --> 31:26.118
[Dennis] Mr. Pope,

31:26.218 --> 31:28.854
the Board of Trustees
would like to speak with you.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.856
Fine.
Put them through.

31:30.957 --> 31:31.958
They're not on the phone.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.560
They're meeting upstairs
right now.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.095
That sounds serious.

32:03.489 --> 32:04.556
...the discovery

32:04.656 --> 32:05.657
that Richard Pope

32:05.757 --> 32:07.994
violated his fiduciary duty
to the college.

32:08.094 --> 32:12.231
The current president and CEO
cut 25% of the faculty,

32:12.331 --> 32:13.499
falsely claiming

32:13.599 --> 32:14.900
that it was
to benefit the school,

32:15.001 --> 32:17.036
all in an effort
to pad his resume

32:17.136 --> 32:19.571
and gain favor
for a position at MIT.

32:19.671 --> 32:20.872
His assistant,

32:20.973 --> 32:23.242
under cover of Pennsylvania's
whistleblower law,

32:23.342 --> 32:24.676
has forwarded emails,

32:24.776 --> 32:26.778
phone logs, and travel logs,

32:26.878 --> 32:29.381
all confirming the allegations.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.555
[chuckles]

32:54.706 --> 32:56.342
[Hank screams,
Russell screams back]

33:04.583 --> 33:06.318
You know,
it's getting cold out there.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.388
Is it?

33:09.488 --> 33:10.489
Did you talk to him yet?

33:12.358 --> 33:13.292
Not really.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.094
Are you going to?

33:17.229 --> 33:18.130
I don't know.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.899
You know, listen,

33:20.999 --> 33:24.770
I know you think that
I'm partially responsible,

33:24.870 --> 33:27.339
you know, because I got him
the job in the bar.

33:27.439 --> 33:31.743
And maybe I'm partly to blame...

33:31.843 --> 33:33.312
for different reasons.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.380
Uh...

33:38.184 --> 33:39.318
I'm-- I'm...

33:39.418 --> 33:41.520
Forget it.
I'm sorry I did that.

33:44.523 --> 33:45.724
Thank you.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.860
I'm sorry for what you and Mom
are going through.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.730
What--
What we're going through?

33:55.101 --> 33:57.669
Oh...

33:57.769 --> 33:59.037
I can't...

33:59.138 --> 34:00.139
Whatever.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.873
What?

34:03.409 --> 34:04.910
What do you think
is happening?

34:05.977 --> 34:07.113
You're here,

34:07.213 --> 34:08.947
and Mom's in New York
with her hot ex-boyfriend

34:09.047 --> 34:10.047
and a broken end table.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.918
You tell me
that's not separated.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.523
He's not hot.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.759
He's younger than you.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.675
So, yeah,

34:36.775 --> 34:39.978
the board
is initiating conversations...

34:40.078 --> 34:42.514
and, uh, we will see.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.583
We will see.

34:44.683 --> 34:45.884
[Lily] Well, t hat's great.

34:45.984 --> 34:46.885
Yeah.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.687
I also had
a pretty interesting day.

34:48.786 --> 34:49.688
Yeah?

34:49.788 --> 34:51.322
Do you remember that thing

34:51.422 --> 34:53.759
about how every time
I say Catherine Keener's name,

34:53.859 --> 34:54.893
you make a move on me?

34:54.993 --> 34:56.695
Uh, no, I--
I don't.

34:57.996 --> 34:58.930
Of course you do.

34:59.030 --> 34:59.898
We've talked about this.

34:59.998 --> 35:02.768
Well, I don't remember.

35:02.868 --> 35:03.969
You really don't?

35:08.340 --> 35:10.242
Oh.

35:10.342 --> 35:11.243
Okay.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.344
It's...

35:12.444 --> 35:13.779
It's nothing, anyway.

35:13.879 --> 35:15.214
Forget it.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.582
Oh, hey...

35:16.682 --> 35:19.518
Julie thinks we're separated.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.387
We're not separated.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.721
I know, right?

35:24.856 --> 35:25.791
That's just...

35:25.891 --> 35:26.758
just silly.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.394
It's so silly.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.601
Uh...

35:35.701 --> 35:37.869
I've got
another big day tomorrow,

35:37.969 --> 35:39.438
I think I should go to sleep.

35:39.538 --> 35:40.439
Okay, good night.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.073
Okay.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.843
Yeah.

35:48.146 --> 35:53.018
[**]

36:03.829 --> 36:07.999
[**]

36:42.501 --> 36:42.868
[Rourke] Hey!

36:43.669 --> 36:46.338
Team, wanna hear
what I just heard?

36:46.438 --> 36:48.006
It is official.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.642
We've all been reinstated,
and Dickie Pope is out.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.781
[Teddy] Well, hey, we should--
we should all go get lunch.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.283
[Emma] Yeah, we just hung out.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.384
[Billie] Hey, where's Spanky?

36:59.585 --> 37:00.619
[Teddy] Oh, yeah.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.953
Well, why isn't he the one
delivering the news?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.188
[Rourke] Yeah, he's only
the chair of the department.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.190
[June] Oh, he's totally
avoiding us.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.192
[Teddy] Rachel?

37:07.293 --> 37:08.827
I don't know.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.662
I think he slipped away.

37:12.464 --> 37:13.532
Isn't this what he wanted?

37:13.632 --> 37:14.566
Oh, god.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.567
I've known the man for 25 years.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.735
I still have no idea
what he wants.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.203
[Rourke]
I don't even think he knows.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.705
[Hank, thinking] Here I am
feeling proud of myself.

37:19.805 --> 37:22.341
How about that?

37:22.441 --> 37:24.075
So why aren't I
going out there?

37:24.175 --> 37:26.645
They're only going
to be happy with me .

37:26.745 --> 37:28.714
Probably the first
and last time.

37:28.814 --> 37:29.848
[June] I have a headache.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.651
If I asked Occam, he'd say...

37:32.751 --> 37:35.120
"It's not them
I want to share this with."

37:45.997 --> 37:46.932
Hello.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.900
I had a few minutes.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.235
I...

37:50.336 --> 37:51.470
I bought lunch.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.677
I had a good day.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.546
Is this chicken salad, Alison?

38:01.547 --> 38:02.548
It's turkey.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.916
And, uh, this is Laurel.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.618
But...

38:06.718 --> 38:09.287
I told you about those layoffs
I was put in charge of.

38:09.388 --> 38:10.889
You remember that?

38:10.989 --> 38:12.290
You said it.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.359
And, yes, we heard it.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.060
Okay. Well...

38:15.160 --> 38:16.828
I figured a way around it.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.399
No one's gonna get fired.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.903
Not just in my department,
but, uh...

38:25.003 --> 38:26.572
across the humanities.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.713
No one saved my job.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.949
[Laurel] Yeah. Well, there were
a lot of jealous people

38:38.049 --> 38:39.084
there at Columbia.

38:39.184 --> 38:41.553
[Henry]
Cutthroat is what it was.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.755
And they cut my throat.

38:43.855 --> 38:44.890
You retired.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.257
I didn't retire.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.726
Don't be naive.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.128
Well, maybe you're not
as sharp as you once were.

38:50.228 --> 38:51.162
That-- That's...

38:51.262 --> 38:53.331
You don't have to be
bitter about it.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.635
Right? You can just look back
at a great long run. Okay?

38:56.735 --> 38:58.169
My mind is fine.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.772
There's professors there
that can't find their own feet.

39:00.872 --> 39:02.307
[laughs]

39:02.408 --> 39:04.342
They set me up.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.978
They fact-checked me
like "gotcha" journalists.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.346
[Hank] Fact-checked?

39:08.447 --> 39:09.915
What are you talking about?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.483
He-- He's not talking
about anything.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.318
He-- He's just
a little confused.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.954
[Henry]
I wrote a piece last year

39:16.054 --> 39:21.059
about my experiences
at the march in Selma, 1965.

39:22.227 --> 39:24.830
We lived in Colorado that year.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.365
You... Were you at Selma?

39:27.466 --> 39:29.167
I could have been!

39:29.267 --> 39:31.803
That's my point.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.872
Better saying
that I was there

39:33.972 --> 39:36.875
than saying
I watched on TV.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.277
You think that gets picked up
in a journal?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.680
You gotta keep publishing, or--

39:41.780 --> 39:44.382
or you don't get invited
to panels.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.518
So if I screwed up,

39:46.618 --> 39:51.490
it was because of their system
that pushed me to it.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.024
They're all responsible.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.326
Oh, it's
an understandable mistake.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.362
Their mistake.

39:57.463 --> 40:00.732
I-- I was taking
well-earned license.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.569
You made up facts for an essay

40:03.669 --> 40:05.971
so that you could be invited
to panels?

40:06.071 --> 40:07.739
What else is there?

40:14.513 --> 40:18.216
[**]

40:18.316 --> 40:20.586
I've started archiving
your father's work.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.855
And, actually,
I need to come to you

40:23.955 --> 40:25.023
and see if we can find

40:25.123 --> 40:26.725
a young student

40:26.825 --> 40:28.527
that might be interested
in being part of...

40:28.627 --> 40:30.361
[Hank, thinking]
For 45 years,

40:30.462 --> 40:31.730
I'd been dying to know

40:31.830 --> 40:34.766
what was so valuable
that he'd leave his family.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.167
And there it is...

40:36.267 --> 40:38.003
conferences.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.438
All this time,
I thought he knew something.

40:40.539 --> 40:43.041
I was trying
to get answers from him, but...

40:43.141 --> 40:45.410
what answers could I get
from such a flawed man

40:45.511 --> 40:46.812
that wouldn't be wrong?

40:48.013 --> 40:49.681
What a loser.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.249
He could have stayed...

40:51.349 --> 40:52.350
and had a son,

40:52.450 --> 40:53.451
known his grandchildren.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.121
He could have had a wife
who just adored him.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.790
He could have had
everything that I have.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.694
I have everything.

No.
