01:14.409 --> 01:15.452
Step right up.

01:15.535 --> 01:17.454
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

01:17.537 --> 01:19.539
and come with us to yesteryear.

01:19.664 --> 01:22.417
Witness the Wild West as it really was.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.836
The greatest show on Earth.

01:25.003 --> 01:28.381
Fun and educational for you, young sir.

01:31.009 --> 01:33.178
Step right up to another time

01:33.261 --> 01:35.680
of mighty beasts
and hard-hearted outlaws.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.096
Kemosabe?

03:00.807 --> 03:02.600
Who? Me?

03:08.147 --> 03:10.108
You bring horses?

03:10.942 --> 03:13.236
I think you made a mistake, mister.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.742
Mistake?

03:31.963 --> 03:33.423
Make trade.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.320
Trade.

04:19.469 --> 04:21.762
Who did you think I was, anyway?

04:27.101 --> 04:29.062
Never take off mask.

04:33.191 --> 04:34.359
Why not?

04:49.207 --> 04:50.625
You sure about this?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.043
Mmm.

04:52.794 --> 04:55.630
Dead man strike fear
into heart of his enemy.

05:00.218 --> 05:01.552
All right.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.680
Let's do this.

05:13.606 --> 05:14.816
Easy!

05:21.114 --> 05:22.490
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:22.573 --> 05:25.076
my colleague and I
will be making a withdrawal.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.036
I understand this bank is insured, so...

05:29.914 --> 05:31.249
...nobody move.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.378
What's with the mask?

05:37.213 --> 05:38.798
See? I told you. I feel ridiculous.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.933
I guess I didn't make myself clear!

05:49.017 --> 05:50.435
This is a damn bank robbery!

05:52.854 --> 05:54.230
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

05:54.939 --> 05:56.357
You're saying you're Tonto?

05:56.441 --> 05:57.442
The Tonto?

05:58.943 --> 06:00.778
There is another?

06:01.154 --> 06:03.948
But the Lone Ranger
and Tonto were good guys.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.075
I mean, they didn't rob banks.

06:09.662 --> 06:10.955
Did they?

06:12.290 --> 06:15.126
Come a time, kemosabe...

06:20.840 --> 06:23.926
...when good man must wear mask.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.440
Run that next rail!

06:40.026 --> 06:42.153
More rocks! They need
more rocks right there!

06:46.365 --> 06:47.825
Rail down!

06:52.872 --> 06:54.665
Shake a leg, chums!

07:13.101 --> 07:15.311
My friends and citizens of Colby,

07:15.394 --> 07:18.439
I've asked you here today
so you can see at firsthand

07:18.523 --> 07:20.316
what I believe to be the single most

07:20.399 --> 07:23.027
important enterprise under God.

07:23.194 --> 07:26.823
The unification of
this great country of ours

07:27.323 --> 07:28.908
by iron rail.

07:29.033 --> 07:30.701
Hear, hear!

07:36.207 --> 07:37.625
To the Comanche,

07:37.708 --> 07:40.086
I say you have nothing to fear.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.380
As long as there is peace between us

07:42.463 --> 07:44.757
all land treaties shall be honoured.

07:45.925 --> 07:49.345
But to the outlaw,
those who prey upon the weak,

07:49.512 --> 07:52.598
make no mistake, law and order

07:52.890 --> 07:54.976
has come to the Wild West.

07:55.226 --> 07:57.311
Which is why I am bringing

07:57.395 --> 08:00.565
notorious outlaw and Indian-killer,

08:00.648 --> 08:04.861
Butch Cavendish here
to Colby to hang for his crimes.

08:06.195 --> 08:10.032
The future is bright,
ladies and gentlemen,

08:10.283 --> 08:12.660
and it's just around the bend.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.138
Ride 'em out! Come on!

08:35.515 --> 08:36.808
Whoa, girl!

08:54.118 --> 08:56.078
Run a man all the way to state line,

08:56.162 --> 08:58.039
put him on a train
and ship him right back.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.999
Don't make no sense.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.835
Guess they run out of
hanging rope in Oklahoma.

09:03.169 --> 09:05.504
Mr Cole wants to make an example.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.841
Word is, Cavendish is
looking for payback with you, Dan.

09:08.925 --> 09:10.259
Reckon so.

09:10.343 --> 09:12.929
They say Butch Cavendish
ate a Red-Legger's heart

09:13.012 --> 09:14.639
in the Missouri wars.

09:15.139 --> 09:16.307
Swallowed it whole.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.309
I heard it was the eyes.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.187
Man told me he ate part of his own foot

09:21.479 --> 09:23.189
just to win a bet.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.775
Hell, he did.

09:26.317 --> 09:27.317
MARTINI Which is it, Dan?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.320
Don't see how it makes a difference.

09:29.904 --> 09:31.030
What's the matter with him?

09:33.491 --> 09:35.952
It's not Cavendish he's worried about.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.480
Like Daniel
entering the lion's den,

10:04.563 --> 10:06.148
we shall stare down the beast.

10:06.232 --> 10:07.275
Amen!

10:07.566 --> 10:09.527
And purge this Godless land

10:09.610 --> 10:12.280
of the poisons of sin and licentiousness.

10:12.363 --> 10:13.781
Hallelujah!

10:13.864 --> 10:17.118
Dear God, grant us
thy mercy and wise judgment.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.619
- Amen!
- Amen.

10:18.703 --> 10:21.247
Thy equanimity
and singleness of purpose,

10:21.330 --> 10:24.417
so we might prove
thy stalwart and worthy servants

10:24.500 --> 10:27.003
in our war against sin. Amen!

10:27.086 --> 10:28.504
Amen.

10:28.587 --> 10:29.839
Catch.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.059
Baby, baby, baby.

10:43.144 --> 10:45.064
- Care to pray with us?

10:45.104 --> 10:46.981
We're Presbyterian.

10:47.857 --> 10:51.527
I'm much obliged, ma'am,
but this, here, is my bible.

10:53.738 --> 10:58.284
<i>Shall we gather at the river</i>

10:58.492 --> 11:03.080
<i>Where bright angel feet have trod</i>

11:03.205 --> 11:07.293
<i>With its crystal tide forever...</i>

11:24.018 --> 11:26.145
It's almost
hanging time, Butch.

11:27.438 --> 11:29.774
Do you hear what I said, boy?

11:38.240 --> 11:41.619
I'm gonna enjoy watching them
wipe that look off your face.

11:46.624 --> 11:49.126
It's broke, Injun. Can't you see that?

12:08.437 --> 12:10.022
Very pretty.

12:15.653 --> 12:16.821
For you.

12:17.071 --> 12:19.198
Oh. No, I couldn't.

12:19.407 --> 12:20.991
For you!

12:25.788 --> 12:27.123
She's right.

12:27.832 --> 12:29.166
It matches your eyes.

12:32.628 --> 12:35.381
I didn't think
you'd make it out, Mrs Reid.

12:35.464 --> 12:37.925
Well, I just wanted
to see what all the fuss was about.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.886
And, um,
what do you think of our endeavour?

12:40.970 --> 12:44.348
Looks to me like
just a lot of men digging in the desert.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.977
Danny, one day soon,

12:48.227 --> 12:50.187
you'll be able
to get on a train right here in Colby,

12:50.271 --> 12:52.022
travel all the way to San Francisco

12:52.106 --> 12:53.941
eating New York oysters packed in ice.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.110
Then you can sail to China.

12:56.277 --> 12:58.612
Come back around
the other way if you want.

12:58.696 --> 13:00.364
That true, Mama?

13:00.448 --> 13:02.408
Well, I'll believe it when I see it.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.326
Here, let me show you.

13:05.870 --> 13:06.871
You see that?

13:07.455 --> 13:08.873
Now you try.

13:09.915 --> 13:13.878
Oh, I expect on a lawman's salary,
quite a lot falls on you.

13:16.714 --> 13:18.591
We do just fine.

13:18.757 --> 13:19.758
Thank you.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.636
Oh, I mean no disrespect.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.228
They don't make men
like your husband any more.

13:25.723 --> 13:27.475
In fact, I envy him.

13:27.725 --> 13:28.934
A fine family.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.812
A son to carry on his name.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.734
I just hate to see a bird in a cage.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.121
Well...

13:49.497 --> 13:51.999
That is right about on time.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.456
Shh!

14:39.296 --> 14:40.506
Piss break, boss.

15:43.861 --> 15:47.990
<i>Grace our spirits will deliver</i>

15:48.198 --> 15:52.119
<i>And provide a robe and crown...</i>

16:22.858 --> 16:24.443
Afternoon, ladies.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.820
There's no need for violence, my son.

16:45.756 --> 16:48.550
Fifteen hours,
I watched you feed that bird.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.471
Gets on a man's nerves.

16:56.684 --> 16:58.727
I do not fear what comes next.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.814
Nothing comes next.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.319
Nice suit.

17:13.701 --> 17:16.787
Time has finally come, Windigo.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.002
Do I know you, Injun?

17:24.461 --> 17:25.753
You know me.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.341
You know me by the screams

17:29.425 --> 17:31.427
of my ancestors in the desert wind.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.847
As you will know their cries of joy

17:34.930 --> 17:38.809
when I remove your evil seed
from the face of Earth.

17:41.979 --> 17:43.480
That won't be necessary.

17:43.564 --> 17:44.565
As District Attorney,

17:44.648 --> 17:46.150
I'll see to it that this man is prosecuted

17:46.233 --> 17:47.901
to the full extent of the law.

17:55.284 --> 17:57.911
What kind of a lawman
don't carry his own gun?

17:58.162 --> 17:59.747
Believe me, where this train's headed,

17:59.830 --> 18:01.248
there's no place for men who do.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.292
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

18:05.586 --> 18:06.837
The future.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.070
Know something, Counsellor?

18:11.425 --> 18:13.218
Maybe you're right.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.430
A lawyer and a crazy Injun.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.016
Bet you two got a lot to talk about.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.270
Best make it quick.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.120
<i>Shall we gather at the river</i>

18:40.204 --> 18:41.455
<i>...the river</i>

18:41.538 --> 18:43.916
I can't get it off.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.709
No...

18:46.376 --> 18:47.503
Play on, boys.

18:50.589 --> 18:52.007
Sing it to me!

18:55.511 --> 18:57.721
Should be slowing down by now.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.565
Anyway, I'm sure we'll be
at the station any minute.

19:14.947 --> 19:16.532
Get the horses! Come on!

19:20.410 --> 19:21.870
Jesus, we ought to go.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.678
That's reinforced Bethlehem steel.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.097
Any attempts at escape is futile.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.984
That's great!

19:52.442 --> 19:53.819
Good job.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.864
And for coming to the aid
of a federal prosecutor,

19:56.947 --> 19:59.283
I can be sure to put in
a good word with the judge.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.764
Come on, boys!
Put your backs into it.

20:22.848 --> 20:25.309
The rail road waits for no man!

20:28.145 --> 20:29.646
That's the end of the line.

20:29.730 --> 20:31.106
We jump.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.066
What about the passengers?

20:33.150 --> 20:34.192
They jump.

20:36.153 --> 20:37.571
There are children on board.

20:37.779 --> 20:38.864
All jump.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.950
Have you no decency?

20:42.034 --> 20:43.243
Windigo getting away!

20:43.493 --> 20:45.287
No, you're not going anywhere.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.057
Going somewhere?

21:05.766 --> 21:07.017
- Yes.
- No.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.936
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.604
- No, we are not. No.
- Yes. Yes.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.356
Shut up!

21:14.149 --> 21:15.150
Yes.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.246
- Ugh.

21:50.727 --> 21:51.853
Thank you.

21:54.398 --> 21:55.983
Do-si-doe.

21:57.567 --> 21:58.986
Why don't you put that thing down,

21:59.069 --> 22:00.862
and we'll settle this like men?

22:01.405 --> 22:02.698
Although, I warn you.

22:03.532 --> 22:05.033
I boxed in law school.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.333
Huh?

22:26.263 --> 22:27.764
Great warrior.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.850
Yeah, that's my brother.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.194
Nice suit.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.196
We have to stop the train.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.281
No time!

22:44.364 --> 22:45.449
Must to jump!

22:46.616 --> 22:48.243
I'm not leaving
these passengers!

22:48.326 --> 22:50.454
Then help me unhook the cars!

22:55.208 --> 22:56.710
Come On!

22:59.337 --> 23:01.298
It's jammed! Give me a hand.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.009
You hold.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.136
Whoa!

23:17.355 --> 23:18.356
John.

23:53.517 --> 23:54.518
What the...

24:56.913 --> 24:58.248
Ugh.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.717
Hey, hold it right there.

25:12.262 --> 25:14.222
I'm afraid I have to take you in.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.521
Do you hear me?

25:21.938 --> 25:23.273
You speak English, don't you?

25:27.777 --> 25:29.196
Halt!

25:31.448 --> 25:33.408
By the authority granted to me

25:33.491 --> 25:35.535
by the state of Texas,

25:35.619 --> 25:38.413
I'm hereby arresting you.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.566
You all right there, little brother?

25:44.628 --> 25:45.712
Fine.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.339
Just taking this man into custody.

25:48.173 --> 25:49.341
Uh-huh.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.889
He was on that train for a reason, Dan.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.641
Probably.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.184
What's your crime, boy?

26:01.144 --> 26:02.395
Indian.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.191
And a man, in the eyes of the law.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.359
Now, throw me your cuffs.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.322
Whatever you say, little brother.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.909
It's nothing personal.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.209
Dan?

26:27.796 --> 26:28.922
John.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.092
They said there was an accident

26:32.175 --> 26:34.094
and someone fell off the train.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.680
Actually, it was me.

26:37.597 --> 26:38.723
Dan's fine.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.185
Saved the day. Same as usual.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.562
Oh, my God, your face.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.106
Um...

26:48.316 --> 26:49.693
Come here.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.118
God, it's good to see you.

26:58.827 --> 27:00.870
What's it been, nine years?

27:01.371 --> 27:03.540
Eight, since you stopped writing.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.585
We were just kids back then.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.217
Well, he takes good care of you, I see.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.389
Yeah. In his way.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.310
He spends most his time

27:23.393 --> 27:25.645
in Indian territory these days.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.647
Indian territory?

27:28.189 --> 27:29.816
Doesn't sound like Dan.

27:29.899 --> 27:31.318
Doing what?

27:31.484 --> 27:32.652
Well, whatever it is,

27:32.736 --> 27:34.404
he doesn't talk to me about it.

27:36.197 --> 27:37.198
So...

27:37.574 --> 27:39.034
Have you got a place to stay?

27:39.117 --> 27:40.160
I...

27:40.243 --> 27:41.703
No. Not as yet.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.164
Well, you should stay
with us at Willow Creek.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.711
I don't know.

27:51.755 --> 27:53.923
Oh, God, look at you.

27:54.549 --> 27:55.925
City boy.

27:57.969 --> 28:00.764
Why would you ever want
to come back here?

28:03.099 --> 28:04.601
It's my home.

28:11.941 --> 28:12.984
Who are you?

28:13.943 --> 28:16.488
Danny, this is your Uncle John.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.348
Why, you look
just like your dad did

28:20.367 --> 28:21.534
when he was your age.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.244
They're going out again.

29:03.201 --> 29:04.536
He deserves a trial, Dan.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.622
Two Rangers are dead.
Didn't get no trial.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.707
Well, I'm coming with you.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.960
The law looks a lot different
on the ground, little brother.

29:12.043 --> 29:13.837
Well, it doesn't include vengeance,

29:13.920 --> 29:15.088
no matter where you're standing.

29:15.171 --> 29:16.756
For "Wherever men unite into society,"

29:16.840 --> 29:18.466
"they must quit the laws
of nature and assume..."

29:18.550 --> 29:20.593
"And assume the laws of men,"

29:20.677 --> 29:23.721
"so that society as a whole
may prosper."

29:24.472 --> 29:27.350
That's John Locke's
<i>Treatises of Government.</i>

29:27.600 --> 29:30.019
Never thought to hear
the likes of it in Colby.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.355
Mr Cole, my brother John.

29:32.522 --> 29:33.731
New county prosecutor.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.444
Latham Cole? It's an honour, sir.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.028
I read about you during the war.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.531
John, here,
is an educated man like yourself.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.616
Well, let's try not to
hold that against him.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.161
You going after Cavendish?

29:46.536 --> 29:48.329
Collins, here, picked up a trail.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.665
- Used to track for our father.
- Can he ride?

29:54.752 --> 29:55.837
Well enough.

29:56.129 --> 29:58.089
Yeah, well, you see to it.

29:58.173 --> 30:00.133
Railroad promised
these people a hanging.

30:00.216 --> 30:01.301
I didn't know the rail road

30:01.384 --> 30:03.052
was in the business
of keeping promises.

30:03.344 --> 30:04.721
A simple task.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.724
Collect the prisoner,
deliver him to his execution.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.143
If you're not up to that, Mr Reid,

30:10.727 --> 30:12.854
I'll find someone who is.

30:20.904 --> 30:23.264
Maybe you should think
about staying in town for a few days.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.283
Comanche are restless.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.576
They're always restless,

30:26.659 --> 30:28.036
but they keep to their side of the river,

30:28.119 --> 30:29.704
and I keep to mine.

30:30.163 --> 30:32.248
Besides, fences won't
put themselves up.

30:33.082 --> 30:34.584
It's my job.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.878
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

30:37.128 --> 30:38.588
I am happy.

30:39.047 --> 30:41.591
I'm happy with the life
you provide. I just...

30:47.096 --> 30:48.348
Is that new?

30:52.936 --> 30:54.604
Matches your eyes.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.026
All right.

31:00.443 --> 31:02.237
Now, I expect you
to be bagging squirrels

31:02.320 --> 31:03.446
by the time I get back.

31:24.217 --> 31:25.969
Like old times, huh?

31:29.138 --> 31:30.223
Thank you.

31:36.229 --> 31:38.314
All right, Mr Prosecutor.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.943
Let's see how your due process
fares on the trail.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.954
It's Dad's.

31:54.622 --> 31:57.166
I hereby deputise you a Texas Ranger.

32:01.170 --> 32:03.172
But I can't help you with them clothes.

32:50.845 --> 32:53.222
Indians call that your spirit horse.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.976
Come to take you to the other side.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.729
You can't scare me
with your ghost stories any more, Dan.

33:01.189 --> 33:03.983
Since when did you start
wearing Indian jewellery, anyway?

33:04.067 --> 33:05.652
Since my kid brother became a lawyer.

33:05.735 --> 33:06.736
Yeah?

33:07.070 --> 33:09.864
World needs lawyers
same as it does Rangers.

33:09.947 --> 33:12.575
I reckon so. It's a nice hat, by the way.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.452
They didn't have a bigger one?

33:16.579 --> 33:18.122
He missed you.

33:18.247 --> 33:19.582
Could have fooled me.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.842
You smell like a distillery already.

33:29.926 --> 33:31.135
Steadies the hand.

33:32.929 --> 33:35.056
You even sleep last night?

33:35.139 --> 33:36.224
You know me, Johnny.

33:36.724 --> 33:40.228
Never been one
to resist a little Western hospitality.

33:43.648 --> 33:45.358
"Red's." Hmm.

33:45.441 --> 33:47.068
What's this? Like, dancing?

33:47.985 --> 33:49.362
Yeah.

33:49.445 --> 33:51.447
Dancing.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.635
Could go by the flats.

34:13.928 --> 34:15.679
Lose a day. Maybe a day and a half.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.056
What is it?

34:18.306 --> 34:19.641
No cover.

34:21.811 --> 34:23.271
What do you figure, Dan?

34:23.603 --> 34:26.149
Figure Collins should go take a look.

34:26.357 --> 34:28.525
If he can stay in the saddle.

34:35.742 --> 34:37.284
John. Come here.

34:43.123 --> 34:46.127
No, I don't believe in them.
You know that.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.505
Butch Cavendish don't care
one way or the other.

34:53.176 --> 34:54.969
I'll take my chances.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.266
You stay close.

35:00.349 --> 35:01.350
Come on.

35:54.445 --> 35:55.446
Where the hell's Collins?

36:00.576 --> 36:01.536
Ambush!

36:01.619 --> 36:03.496
I can't see him!

36:03.579 --> 36:04.956
I got no shot!

36:06.332 --> 36:07.416
Ride! Ride!

36:45.037 --> 36:46.122
Dan!

36:46.789 --> 36:48.958
Ride! Ride out!

37:05.892 --> 37:08.269
Your hand! John, give me your hand!

37:08.436 --> 37:09.854
- No. No!

37:12.440 --> 37:14.567
No, Dan! Dan!

37:14.859 --> 37:16.485
No! No, no...

37:19.071 --> 37:20.865
You shouldn't have come back, John.

37:20.948 --> 37:21.991
No, it's okay. It's okay.

37:22.158 --> 37:23.534
I messed up.

37:24.327 --> 37:27.079
No, no. You're okay, you're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.834
She always loved you.

37:35.463 --> 37:37.423
Take care of her for me.

37:38.382 --> 37:40.468
No, you're coming with me.
Come on! Come on!

37:56.484 --> 37:57.443
Come on!

38:37.483 --> 38:40.069
It's been a long time, Ranger.

38:42.029 --> 38:43.739
You've looked better.

38:44.782 --> 38:48.160
I heard them boys in Tulsa
took a real shine to you.

38:52.707 --> 38:54.500
All heart, ain't you?

39:03.175 --> 39:06.095
A year you took from me
in that sweatbox.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.603
You take something from me,

39:15.813 --> 39:17.398
be damn sure

39:20.776 --> 39:23.029
I'm gonna take something from you.

39:31.996 --> 39:33.914
Oh, yes!

40:15.873 --> 40:18.000
Deal dies with you, old friend.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.017
<i>That's not night.</i>

41:17.977 --> 41:19.228
<i>It can't be right.</i>

41:20.729 --> 41:23.107
They're dead? All dead?

41:23.566 --> 41:24.608
Even Dan?

41:27.153 --> 41:28.863
Dan very dead.

41:30.156 --> 41:31.949
But he's the Lone Ranger.

41:33.242 --> 41:35.786
Would have been much easier, I agree.

41:38.038 --> 41:40.207
How did you get out of jail, anyway?

41:40.291 --> 41:41.584
Hmm?

41:57.975 --> 42:00.269
And would you stop feeding that bird?

42:00.352 --> 42:01.770
It's not alive, you know.

42:06.734 --> 42:09.028
Awaiting spirit to return.

42:10.070 --> 42:11.780
Not same thing.

43:13.467 --> 43:14.593
Hmm.

43:52.298 --> 43:55.092
Greetings, noble spirit horse.

44:01.640 --> 44:05.060
No, no! No, no, please.
You make mistake.

44:08.397 --> 44:09.523
Half-wit.

44:10.149 --> 44:11.650
- Wet brain.

44:12.318 --> 44:13.402
You come.

44:13.527 --> 44:14.653
Come, come.

44:18.991 --> 44:20.075
Him

44:20.743 --> 44:22.494
great warrior.

44:25.914 --> 44:27.416
Spirit horse

44:28.917 --> 44:30.252
you have travelled far.

44:30.753 --> 44:32.546
Obviously very fatigued.

44:32.755 --> 44:34.256
I understand.

44:35.424 --> 44:36.967
You come. Come, come.

44:37.051 --> 44:38.344
- Come, come.

44:41.597 --> 44:43.140
Him strong brother.

44:43.223 --> 44:45.100
- Want him, bring him back.

45:36.902 --> 45:38.028
John! Give me your hand!

45:50.249 --> 45:51.291
Rebecca.

45:55.337 --> 45:56.338
John!

47:46.990 --> 47:48.630
If you are going to
sneak up on an Indian,

47:48.867 --> 47:50.452
best to do it downwind.

47:52.287 --> 47:54.164
Why are you talking to that horse?

47:54.248 --> 47:57.417
My grandfather spoke
of a time when animals could speak.

47:58.043 --> 48:01.338
When you get them alone, some still do.

48:02.714 --> 48:05.634
But I cannot decide
whether this horse is stupid,

48:06.677 --> 48:08.637
or pretending to be stupid.

48:10.305 --> 48:11.515
Tricky.

48:13.141 --> 48:14.476
Why am I covered in dirt?

48:16.144 --> 48:17.604
Because I buried you.

48:21.483 --> 48:22.651
Then why am I alive?

48:26.446 --> 48:29.157
Horse says you are Spirit Walker.

48:30.200 --> 48:32.035
A man who has been to the other side,

48:32.119 --> 48:33.537
and returned.

48:33.870 --> 48:34.955
A man

48:36.081 --> 48:38.500
who cannot be killed in battle.

48:43.463 --> 48:45.424
Horse definitely stupid.

48:48.093 --> 48:49.803
Are those my boots?

49:05.027 --> 49:07.029
He cut out his heart.

49:08.572 --> 49:10.991
What kind of a man
does something like that?

49:12.117 --> 49:13.410
Not a man.

49:14.411 --> 49:16.038
An evil spirit

49:16.121 --> 49:18.999
born in the empty spaces of the desert.

49:20.167 --> 49:21.835
With a hunger

49:23.420 --> 49:25.547
that cannot be satisfied.

49:31.219 --> 49:34.181
And the power
to throw nature out of balance.

49:38.644 --> 49:41.229
My people call this spirit "windigo."

49:41.938 --> 49:44.566
I am Tonto of the Comanche,

49:45.067 --> 49:47.152
last of the windigo hunters.

49:47.527 --> 49:49.488
So, what do you want with me?

49:49.571 --> 49:52.115
A vision told me a great warrior

49:52.199 --> 49:54.951
and Spirit Walker
would help me on my quest.

49:56.411 --> 49:58.622
I would have preferred someone else.

49:58.705 --> 50:00.499
Your brother, perhaps.

50:01.333 --> 50:02.751
He would have been good.

50:03.752 --> 50:06.630
But who am I to question
the great father, hmm?

50:07.923 --> 50:10.425
All I know is a man killed my brother,

50:10.759 --> 50:12.844
and I'll see him hang for it.

50:21.186 --> 50:23.146
Then you will need this.

50:27.067 --> 50:28.068
A bullet?

50:28.527 --> 50:29.695
Mmm.

50:31.238 --> 50:32.364
A silver bullet?

50:32.447 --> 50:34.366
Silver made him what he is.

50:35.033 --> 50:37.703
And so it will return him to the earth.

50:40.914 --> 50:42.082
Right.

50:43.166 --> 50:44.251
You know what?

50:44.793 --> 50:47.170
I would like to thank you

50:47.254 --> 50:49.631
for everything that you've done for me.

50:51.967 --> 50:53.844
But I should get back.

50:57.973 --> 51:01.017
I, too,
seek the windigo Butch Cavendish.

51:01.643 --> 51:02.686
Good.

51:02.769 --> 51:04.438
I was prisoner on the train

51:04.521 --> 51:06.356
the way a coyote stalks buffalo.

51:06.732 --> 51:09.943
After hunting 26 years I had my prey

51:10.026 --> 51:11.278
until you interfere.

51:14.406 --> 51:16.867
Actually, I think I saved your life.

51:18.493 --> 51:19.786
So, we're even.

51:21.455 --> 51:22.539
Ow!

51:23.832 --> 51:25.167
What the hell was that for?

51:26.418 --> 51:28.211
Bird angry.

51:33.759 --> 51:35.635
Yeah. You know what?

51:35.844 --> 51:37.471
I can't help you.

51:37.888 --> 51:39.222
Or your bird.

51:39.389 --> 51:40.515
Where do you go?

51:40.807 --> 51:42.893
Into town, to form a posse.

51:43.268 --> 51:44.811
I would not do that, kemosabe.

51:45.020 --> 51:46.021
Yeah?

51:46.146 --> 51:49.274
There was a gun
waiting for Cavendish on the train.

51:51.193 --> 51:53.236
Eight men rode into canyon.

51:55.030 --> 51:56.782
I dig seven graves.

52:01.620 --> 52:02.871
Collins.

52:08.043 --> 52:10.086
He's known us since we were kids.

52:11.296 --> 52:13.173
You find traitor,

52:15.884 --> 52:18.178
you find the man who killed your brother.

52:20.263 --> 52:22.307
That's my brother's vest.

52:26.728 --> 52:30.148
Eyes, cut by the bullets that killed him.

52:31.358 --> 52:32.901
From the great beyond,

52:33.235 --> 52:35.070
he will protect you

52:36.238 --> 52:37.864
and the ones you love.

52:39.699 --> 52:41.868
You want me to wear a mask?

52:42.077 --> 52:44.913
The men you seek
think you are dead, kemosabe.

52:47.040 --> 52:49.000
Better to stay that way.

52:58.593 --> 53:01.137
All right, but if we ride together,

53:01.221 --> 53:03.765
it's to bring these men to justice
in a court of law.

53:04.307 --> 53:06.059
Is that understood?

53:24.244 --> 53:25.745
Justice

53:26.079 --> 53:28.540
is what I seek, kemosabe.

53:32.460 --> 53:34.754
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen,

53:34.838 --> 53:37.382
into the Hall of Human Deformities.

53:37.549 --> 53:40.552
Fun and educational for you, sir.

53:48.768 --> 53:50.448
<i>...trampling out the vintage</i>

53:50.478 --> 53:53.440
<i>Where the grapes of wrath are stored...</i>

53:54.274 --> 53:57.193
God has forsaken all you sinners,

53:57.277 --> 54:00.572
and now the armies of hell are upon us.

54:01.197 --> 54:03.491
Heathen. Heathen!

54:05.285 --> 54:07.454
Heathen in our midst!

54:08.038 --> 54:09.289
Heathen!

54:12.250 --> 54:13.877
I'm looking for a man.

54:15.211 --> 54:16.296
I bet.

54:17.380 --> 54:18.590
Got money?

54:18.673 --> 54:19.925
Of course.

54:25.305 --> 54:26.640
Where did you get that?

54:26.723 --> 54:27.724
Make trade.

54:29.017 --> 54:30.685
With a dead man?

54:31.186 --> 54:32.562
Hard bargain.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.210
So...

54:55.460 --> 54:58.296
Are all these women professionals?

54:58.546 --> 55:00.966
Sickness of greed is strong.

55:02.050 --> 55:03.385
What about her?

55:04.803 --> 55:06.721
Oh, yes. Her, too.

55:09.349 --> 55:11.059
So how do you know all this?

55:11.142 --> 55:13.478
A vision said it would be so.

55:13.561 --> 55:14.646
Hmm.

55:14.729 --> 55:16.064
Hi, Tonto.

55:26.866 --> 55:28.702
Couple of freaks here to see you.

55:28.785 --> 55:30.203
Mmm-hmm. Thank you, Homer.

55:30.286 --> 55:31.746
Just let me do the talking.

55:33.748 --> 55:34.749
Ma'am.

55:36.710 --> 55:37.836
What's with the mask?

55:39.587 --> 55:41.256
Second thought, don't answer that.

55:41.339 --> 55:43.425
No, one thing you learn in my business.

55:43.508 --> 55:46.261
Killers, preachers,
war heroes, railroaders...

55:46.344 --> 55:47.846
Every man has his thing.

55:49.139 --> 55:51.850
Railroaders?
Are you referring to Mr Cole?

55:52.934 --> 55:54.853
Oh, no, not Mr Cole. No.

55:54.936 --> 55:57.313
By all reports, Mr Cole is, uh...

55:57.397 --> 55:59.107
Well, he is no longer guided

55:59.232 --> 56:00.712
by the same imperatives as other men.

56:02.736 --> 56:04.362
Mr Cole gelding.

56:04.779 --> 56:06.179
Come to think of it, there was talk

56:06.239 --> 56:08.199
of an incident during the war.

56:08.283 --> 56:09.367
Let go of me!

56:09.451 --> 56:11.453
I won't let you go!

56:13.621 --> 56:14.789
- Whoa!

56:17.208 --> 56:19.044
No free rides, gentlemen!

56:24.549 --> 56:25.800
Scrimshaw.

56:26.051 --> 56:27.218
Ivory.

56:27.385 --> 56:28.970
- I want to touch.
- Uh-uh!

56:29.345 --> 56:31.139
Not if you favour your hand.

56:32.474 --> 56:35.226
We're looking for a man named Collins.

56:35.310 --> 56:37.645
He's a tracker, speaks Indian.

56:38.229 --> 56:39.355
Never heard of him.

56:40.231 --> 56:41.441
I see.

56:42.484 --> 56:43.651
Well...

56:44.319 --> 56:46.279
Coming in here,
we did happen to notice a number

56:46.362 --> 56:48.615
of fairly serious health code violations.

56:48.698 --> 56:49.699
Hmm.

56:51.409 --> 56:52.702
It is a house of sin.

56:52.786 --> 56:54.537
Yes, well, one with evidence

56:54.621 --> 56:56.539
of livestock on the premises,

56:56.623 --> 56:58.750
inadequately marked fire escapes,

56:58.833 --> 57:01.252
and a fairly sinister-looking
jar of pickles on the bar.

57:01.336 --> 57:02.462
Hmm. Pickles?

57:02.670 --> 57:04.214
Unrefrigerated.

57:04.422 --> 57:06.132
I'd hate to have to shut you down.

57:06.216 --> 57:07.656
You want to shut down the rail road?

57:07.759 --> 57:08.760
- Yes.
- No.

57:08.843 --> 57:10.428
- Yes.
- Well, then you have a problem,

57:10.512 --> 57:11.792
because there ain't no rail road

57:11.846 --> 57:13.765
without girls like mine
doing the heavy lifting.

57:14.140 --> 57:16.267
Homer, help these morons find the door.

57:19.354 --> 57:21.147
Windigo getting away.

57:21.397 --> 57:22.758
What the hell is he talking about?

57:23.233 --> 57:24.818
Nothing. It's an Indian thing.

57:25.318 --> 57:28.071
Man who has taste for human flesh.

57:31.783 --> 57:33.368
Butch Cavendish.

57:35.662 --> 57:36.663
That's right.

57:41.042 --> 57:42.710
Well, why didn't you just say so?

57:43.294 --> 57:45.630
Collins was in about
a week ago with a lawman.

57:45.713 --> 57:47.715
Ranger like you, as a matter of fact.

57:47.799 --> 57:49.884
Said his name was, uh, Reid.

57:50.844 --> 57:51.845
Dan Reid?

57:52.137 --> 57:53.805
Had themselves
a hell of an argument.

57:53.888 --> 57:54.889
What about?

57:54.973 --> 57:56.534
Something
they found in the desert.

57:56.641 --> 57:58.059
Paid me with this.

58:01.563 --> 58:03.148
Do not touch rock!

58:04.524 --> 58:05.942
Rock cursed.

58:25.670 --> 58:28.256
Injun's right. Worthless around here.

58:28.423 --> 58:29.841
But get it to San Francisco,

58:29.924 --> 58:32.260
they'd pay a thousand dollars cash.

58:32.427 --> 58:34.762
Maybe I'll be on the first train west.

58:34.846 --> 58:36.514
- Retire.

58:39.309 --> 58:40.476
Do you have cat?

58:40.560 --> 58:41.561
I did.

58:42.270 --> 58:43.354
I thought he'd be an improvement

58:43.438 --> 58:44.772
on the last man in my life,

58:44.856 --> 58:45.857
but maybe it's me.

58:45.940 --> 58:47.984
Red, we got trouble.

58:55.366 --> 58:56.534
What are you doing?

58:56.618 --> 58:58.828
Comanche gesture of respect.

58:59.078 --> 59:00.955
Taste another man's drink.

59:01.039 --> 59:02.290
Oh. Right.

59:02.373 --> 59:04.417
- Thank you.
- I'm afraid we're gonna have to

59:04.500 --> 59:05.861
bring our little visit to a close.

59:05.877 --> 59:08.630
Some of my clientèle don't take kindly
to an Indian on the premises.

59:10.924 --> 59:12.884
He has as much right
to be here as anyone else.

59:12.967 --> 59:15.261
Not since the Comanche
violated the treaty.

59:15.762 --> 59:17.472
- Treaty?
- You didn't hear?

59:17.597 --> 59:19.758
They've been raiding settlements
up and down the river.

59:20.934 --> 59:22.644
My God. Rebecca.

59:25.021 --> 59:26.481
Fear of cat.

59:27.982 --> 59:28.983
Better go out the back.

59:31.653 --> 59:32.820
How do I thank you?

59:33.738 --> 59:36.908
Just make that animal pay
for what he took from me.

59:41.454 --> 59:42.580
Hey!

59:50.004 --> 59:52.674
Nature is indeed out of balance.

01:00:04.477 --> 01:00:05.645
Come. Must to go.

01:00:06.354 --> 01:00:08.022
Must to go, drunken beast!

01:00:09.941 --> 01:00:11.859
'Tis judgment day, harlot!

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:13.111
Oh.

01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:14.529
May I help you?

01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:15.780
Where are they?

01:00:16.364 --> 01:00:18.116
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.035
Ma'am, I believe I've located your...

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:24.372
...cat.

01:00:26.082 --> 01:00:27.083
Ma'am.

01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:28.960
- Get him!

01:00:29.294 --> 01:00:30.920
There's the redskin!

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:52.692
Where you runnin', Injun?

01:00:53.026 --> 01:00:55.236
What the hell is wrong
with these people?

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.280
Blood has been spilled, kemosabe.

01:00:58.197 --> 01:01:00.908
And soon, rivers run red.

01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:09.625
Oh, God...

01:01:13.755 --> 01:01:15.590
Let's call it a night, Joe.

01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:17.508
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:31.272 --> 01:01:32.774
Come on, Danny.

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:31.791
Get yourselves inside!

01:02:31.958 --> 01:02:33.251
Danny, come on.

01:02:34.419 --> 01:02:35.461
Pilar, get the shutters.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:19.088
- Pilar, fire!

01:04:06.427 --> 01:04:08.095
Indian savages.

01:04:09.597 --> 01:04:11.098
Was not Indian.

01:04:12.433 --> 01:04:13.851
The hell it wasn't.

01:04:15.061 --> 01:04:17.563
Indians make trade.

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:22.360
Leave him alone.

01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:25.404
I said leave him alone!

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:29.575
Indian is like coyote.

01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:32.161
He kill and leave nothing to waste.

01:04:32.828 --> 01:04:34.622
Tell me, kemosabe,

01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:37.875
what does the white man kill for?

01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:55.309
This one's nice, ain't it?

01:04:58.229 --> 01:04:59.897
I love me some aquamarine.

01:05:06.195 --> 01:05:07.405
Not an Indian.

01:05:07.488 --> 01:05:09.991
This ain't what it looks like, mister.

01:05:10.157 --> 01:05:12.243
I just like them pretty things.

01:05:12.326 --> 01:05:14.912
Rebecca and Danny. Where are they?

01:05:16.581 --> 01:05:19.834
You tell me where they are, or I'll let
the Indian do what he wants to you.

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:23.462
What does he want to do?

01:05:33.139 --> 01:05:34.473
What the hell is going on?

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:36.434
There's a Ranger.

01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:37.768
What are you talking about?

01:05:37.852 --> 01:05:40.021
He got some lunatic Indian with him.

01:05:40.313 --> 01:05:42.690
He was gonna violate me
with a duck foot.

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.949
You shoot anything that comes out.

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.544
Go for horse, kemosabe.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:06.088
I cover you.

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:10.092
Why don't I cover you?

01:06:10.176 --> 01:06:11.886
You have been to the other side.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.180
Spirit Walker cannot be killed.

01:06:17.725 --> 01:06:19.060
All right.

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.812
But we take them alive.

01:06:24.899 --> 01:06:26.108
Texas Ranger!

01:06:26.525 --> 01:06:28.944
Put down your weapons
and step out with your hands up!

01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:36.202
It's dark!

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:39.080
Spirit Walker.

01:06:39.914 --> 01:06:42.083
See! What did I tell you?

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:43.751
Go around back.

01:06:47.588 --> 01:06:49.298
What's with the mask?

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:23.624
What is it?

01:07:30.965 --> 01:07:32.591
So, the horse,

01:07:33.384 --> 01:07:34.802
it can fly?

01:07:36.178 --> 01:07:37.847
Don't be stupid.

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:53.988
Hold it right there.

01:07:57.366 --> 01:07:58.492
Rebecca and Danny,

01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:00.369
where are they?

01:08:00.661 --> 01:08:02.955
Comanche don't take no prisoners.

01:08:03.164 --> 01:08:04.498
Just the scalps.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.917
Isn't that right, boy?

01:08:13.299 --> 01:08:15.176
I will take the Spaniard.

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:19.438
I haven't fired a gun
in nine years.

01:08:21.849 --> 01:08:24.350
Might want to keep that
to yourself, kemosabe.

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:42.912
Great shot!

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:45.206
That was supposed
to be a warning shot.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.582
In that case, not so good.

01:08:54.423 --> 01:08:55.424
What?

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:58.219
Nothing.

01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:22.910
That was my brother's.

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.703
Comanche.

01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:28.122
Very sacred.

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:34.462
How am I supposed
to find Rebecca and Danny now?

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:38.091
Tracks lead north,
toward Indian country.

01:09:39.343 --> 01:09:41.595
That's 400 square miles
of rock and desert.

01:09:41.679 --> 01:09:43.279
Even an Indian can't track through that.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:45.724
We follow horse, kemosabe.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.313
"Kemosa..." Why do you
keep calling me that?

01:09:51.397 --> 01:09:52.689
What's that mean?

01:09:56.443 --> 01:09:57.695
"Wrong brother."

01:10:00.114 --> 01:10:01.198
Right.

01:10:13.127 --> 01:10:15.045
My husband will kill you for this.

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:18.007
That'd be a trick.

01:10:20.843 --> 01:10:23.387
Last time I saw your husband,

01:10:23.554 --> 01:10:25.639
he was drowning in his own blood.

01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:30.728
We got company.

01:10:30.811 --> 01:10:32.021
Hold up!

01:10:32.855 --> 01:10:34.148
It's Frank.

01:10:43.866 --> 01:10:45.409
Where's Barret and Jesus?

01:10:47.703 --> 01:10:49.079
He killed them.

01:10:49.246 --> 01:10:50.539
Straight draw.

01:10:51.165 --> 01:10:54.001
Fired one bullet
and they didn't stand a chance.

01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:56.378
You better start talking straight, Frank.

01:10:56.462 --> 01:10:57.880
Now, who killed them?

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:02.051
It was a Ranger, Butch.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.637
A lone Ranger.

01:11:09.433 --> 01:11:10.601
Rangers are dead.

01:11:13.938 --> 01:11:15.105
The ghost of Dan Reid.

01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:16.440
Frank!

01:11:16.857 --> 01:11:17.858
He coming for you.

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:21.195
You shouldn't have done what you did.

01:11:21.612 --> 01:11:22.863
Shut up!

01:11:23.864 --> 01:11:25.532
Let him come!

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:28.035
I killed him once.

01:11:28.577 --> 01:11:31.538
I won't have to answer for it
when I kill him again.

01:11:31.705 --> 01:11:33.290
Scared, aren't you?

01:11:38.087 --> 01:11:39.421
You should be.

01:11:46.971 --> 01:11:47.972
Hey, Collins.

01:11:50.057 --> 01:11:52.810
Do you know
what the Indians call this place?

01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:56.105
"The Valley of Tears."

01:12:07.783 --> 01:12:10.285
Please don't do this. Please, don't...

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:15.916
Mmm!

01:12:18.836 --> 01:12:19.920
That's far enough.

01:12:26.093 --> 01:12:27.094
Don't look at me.

01:12:27.594 --> 01:12:29.096
He loved you.

01:12:30.806 --> 01:12:32.474
I said, don't look at me.

01:12:44.194 --> 01:12:45.863
Run.

01:12:47.114 --> 01:12:48.657
Please, run.

01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:54.038
Danny, come on.

01:12:57.332 --> 01:12:58.625
- Mama?

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:16.894
Why would Cavendish
make it look

01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:19.480
like the Comanche violated the treaty?

01:13:19.646 --> 01:13:20.647
It has something to do

01:13:20.773 --> 01:13:22.413
with what my brother found in the desert.

01:13:22.608 --> 01:13:24.610
Perhaps he want to make it look

01:13:24.693 --> 01:13:26.945
like Comanche violate treaty.

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:30.324
That's very helpful, thank you.

01:13:30.657 --> 01:13:31.825
Whoa.

01:13:32.493 --> 01:13:33.952
What is it?

01:14:02.523 --> 01:14:04.024
Horse dead.

01:14:04.358 --> 01:14:07.027
I can see that. Now what?

01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:13.700
We're lost, aren't we?

01:14:14.743 --> 01:14:15.744
I knew it.

01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:17.913
Just follow the horse.
That was your idea?

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.541
But you can't talk
to a dead horse, now, can you?

01:14:20.707 --> 01:14:22.709
You know what? Let me try.

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:27.256
Hello. If you could
just point us in the right direction,

01:14:27.422 --> 01:14:28.882
we'll take it from here.

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:30.259
What's that?

01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:31.885
Nothing!

01:14:36.932 --> 01:14:39.143
That's just fantastic, isn't it?
Cavendish is out there somewhere,

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:40.936
doing God-knows-what
to Rebecca and Danny,

01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:42.646
and I'm gonna die
here in the desert with you

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:44.231
and that ridiculous bird!

01:14:48.235 --> 01:14:50.028
The woman, Rebecca,

01:14:50.195 --> 01:14:52.406
you will fill her with child, no?

01:14:52.573 --> 01:14:53.574
What?

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:54.741
No!

01:14:54.908 --> 01:14:56.368
That's my brother's wife.

01:14:57.077 --> 01:14:58.912
When you were on the other side,

01:14:59.246 --> 01:15:01.582
you spoke of her in your vision.

01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:06.211
Well, lack of oxygen
can cause the brain to hallucinate.

01:15:06.295 --> 01:15:07.629
Everyone knows that.

01:15:07.754 --> 01:15:08.755
Yes,

01:15:09.423 --> 01:15:13.260
but you did not speak of her
as the wife of your brother.

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:17.556
Well, she's his widow now.

01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:20.309
So, it is better that
she live the rest of her life alone?

01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:22.644
Yes. No.

01:15:23.604 --> 01:15:26.607
Look, it just isn't done.
You wouldn't understand.

01:15:27.399 --> 01:15:28.984
Because I am a savage?

01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:45.959
Would you stop?

01:15:46.126 --> 01:15:47.211
You can't track.

01:15:47.294 --> 01:15:50.172
If you could, we wouldn't be
out here in the first place!

01:15:55.844 --> 01:15:56.845
What is that?

01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:58.639
Track!

01:16:00.349 --> 01:16:02.309
That's impossible.

01:16:07.981 --> 01:16:09.650
Train track.

01:16:14.154 --> 01:16:16.198
You are lost, aren't you?

01:16:17.199 --> 01:16:18.951
Train tracks?

01:16:19.117 --> 01:16:21.161
I thought you were in Indian territory.

01:16:22.788 --> 01:16:23.956
Yes.

01:16:52.609 --> 01:16:54.069
Let the Comanche make no mistake.

01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:57.364
We will not be dissuaded from our task.

01:16:57.489 --> 01:16:59.032
- From here on,

01:16:59.199 --> 01:17:01.785
all treaties with the Indian Nation

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:03.537
are null and void.

01:17:04.538 --> 01:17:06.164
We will be in Promontory Summit

01:17:06.248 --> 01:17:07.374
ahead of schedule,

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:09.918
three days from today!

01:17:10.085 --> 01:17:13.422
Now, go ahead. Put that in your paper.

01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:17.175
Mr Cole! Mr Cole!

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:19.720
Sir?

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:22.389
It arrived last night.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.934
I had to dip into petty cash.

01:17:26.101 --> 01:17:27.936
Put it somewhere safe.

01:17:28.437 --> 01:17:30.188
Where would that be?

01:17:30.856 --> 01:17:32.566
Use your imagination.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.244
I understand you have
an Indian problem.

01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:47.289
Right on time.

01:18:06.933 --> 01:18:08.560
I thought you said I couldn't get shot.

01:18:10.062 --> 01:18:11.229
No.

01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:13.440
I said you could not be killed.

01:18:13.565 --> 01:18:14.649
Oh.

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:18.779
Apache?

01:18:18.987 --> 01:18:20.197
Comanche.

01:18:20.364 --> 01:18:21.365
Well, that's good, right?

01:18:22.324 --> 01:18:23.950
Not so much.

01:18:26.453 --> 01:18:27.537
What are they doing?

01:18:28.288 --> 01:18:29.289
Death dance.

01:18:29.373 --> 01:18:31.500
They are preparing for war
with the white man.

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:32.834
War?

01:18:34.169 --> 01:18:35.170
Wait.

01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:37.631
Is that thing sterile?

01:18:37.714 --> 01:18:40.008
Yes. I make urine on it.

01:18:40.175 --> 01:18:41.343
What?

01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:45.222
- War?

01:18:45.305 --> 01:18:47.641
But the Comanche didn't
attack the settlements!

01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:50.894
White man does not know this.

01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:52.938
But you're going to tell them.

01:18:53.021 --> 01:18:55.982
I mean, you did tell them, right?

01:19:10.414 --> 01:19:11.915
My name's John Reid,

01:19:12.082 --> 01:19:14.167
and I know that you didn't
raid those settlements.

01:19:14.334 --> 01:19:16.420
If you let me go, I can prove it.

01:19:16.837 --> 01:19:20.340
There doesn't have to
be a war, understand?

01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:25.095
No. Of course you don't.

01:19:31.852 --> 01:19:33.019
Mmm!

01:19:33.895 --> 01:19:36.440
Good. Good.

01:19:37.023 --> 01:19:40.068
Me, Spirit Walker

01:19:40.235 --> 01:19:41.945
from great beyond.

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:46.575
The hunter of wendingo

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:49.697
and the other things.

01:19:49.744 --> 01:19:51.455
Sunstroke?

01:19:51.872 --> 01:19:55.250
Or his mind is poisoned with whiskey.

01:20:02.382 --> 01:20:04.759
Comanche gesture of respect?

01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:07.637
What's with the mask?

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:11.016
What?

01:20:11.099 --> 01:20:12.642
Tonto told you these things?

01:20:13.768 --> 01:20:14.769
That's right.

01:20:14.895 --> 01:20:17.063
And he told you to wear the mask?

01:20:24.446 --> 01:20:25.489
That's funny?

01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:26.740
Very funny.

01:20:26.907 --> 01:20:27.908
Tonto's a Comanche.

01:20:28.575 --> 01:20:29.826
He's one of you.

01:20:31.495 --> 01:20:32.954
No more.

01:20:37.334 --> 01:20:39.085
What do you mean?

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:43.590
His mind is broken.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:48.929
He is a band apart.

01:20:55.101 --> 01:20:56.937
<i>Many moons ago,</i>

01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:01.441
<i>a boy found two white men
in the desert.</i>

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:13.995
<i>He brought them to
his village to be healed.</i>

01:21:25.382 --> 01:21:27.717
<i>When they found silver in the river,</i>

01:21:28.843 --> 01:21:31.179
<i>they asked the boy where it came from.</i>

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.369
<i>In exchange for a cheap pocket watch</i>

01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:56.162
<i>from Sears Roebuck,</i>

01:21:56.329 --> 01:22:00.667
<i>the boy showed them
where the river begins,</i>

01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:06.590
<i>where they found more silver</i>

01:22:06.673 --> 01:22:09.718
<i>than any white man had ever seen.</i>

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:15.056
<i>They took what they could carry,</i>

01:22:15.724 --> 01:22:19.019
<i>but they wanted to
keep the place a secret,</i>

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:21.563
<i>so they could one day return.</i>

01:23:05.774 --> 01:23:09.694
<i>The boy could not live
with what he had done,</i>

01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:12.947
<i>so he decided the men were possessed</i>

01:23:13.073 --> 01:23:15.575
<i>by evil spirits in the silver.</i>

01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:22.749
<i>He called it "windigo,"</i>

01:23:22.916 --> 01:23:26.252
<i>like the ghost stories
we tell our children.</i>

01:23:34.928 --> 01:23:36.429
<i>And he made a vow.</i>

01:23:36.763 --> 01:23:39.099
<i>When he found these two men,</i>

01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:40.600
<i>he would drain their blood</i>

01:23:40.684 --> 01:23:43.436
<i>into the soil of his ancestors,</i>

01:23:46.106 --> 01:23:49.442
<i>so he could return to the tribe.</i>

01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:55.073
But he is too late.

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.576
There is no more tribe to return to.

01:23:59.619 --> 01:24:01.454
Our time has passed.

01:24:02.247 --> 01:24:05.792
They call it "progress."

01:24:09.713 --> 01:24:13.049
You're John Reid, brother of Dan.

01:24:14.467 --> 01:24:15.552
Yes.

01:24:17.554 --> 01:24:19.305
By this totem, your brother swore

01:24:19.431 --> 01:24:20.557
if we kept the peace,

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.892
he would protect our land.

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:25.895
Now the Cavalry cut down our children.

01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:29.733
Like all white men, your brother lied.

01:24:29.899 --> 01:24:32.569
No. No, Dan was murdered.

01:24:32.736 --> 01:24:35.363
And if you let me go,
I'll keep his promise.

01:24:38.616 --> 01:24:39.993
So, we have a deal?

01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:45.290
Not so much.

01:24:48.752 --> 01:24:51.004
My name come up?

01:24:57.469 --> 01:24:59.512
Please, this is a mistake.

01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:01.681
There doesn't need to be a war.

01:25:02.098 --> 01:25:03.183
It makes no difference.

01:25:04.267 --> 01:25:06.478
We are already ghosts.

01:25:16.613 --> 01:25:17.739
Shh! Shh!

01:25:21.451 --> 01:25:22.702
Cavalry.

01:25:23.244 --> 01:25:24.871
Let us bring the pure sceptre

01:25:24.954 --> 01:25:27.415
of Almighty God
to the heathens!

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:31.628
Oh, thank God! Civilisation.

01:25:31.795 --> 01:25:33.963
We'll just explain the entire situation,

01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:36.674
and we'll get this whole
misunderstanding cleared up.

01:25:36.841 --> 01:25:38.510
The United States Army.

01:25:38.593 --> 01:25:40.470
Finally someone
who will listen to reason.

01:25:49.771 --> 01:25:52.774
Help! Over here!

01:25:53.691 --> 01:25:55.026
Wait!

01:25:58.363 --> 01:26:00.114
Perhaps they didn't see us.

01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:01.533
Oh, no.

01:26:01.699 --> 01:26:03.952
They will be back any minute now.

01:26:07.747 --> 01:26:08.915
Could be worse.

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:11.084
Worse?

01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:13.294
How could this be worse?

01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:15.380
Could develop an itch

01:26:17.799 --> 01:26:19.634
on your nose.

01:26:24.973 --> 01:26:27.141
I'm not talking to you any more.

01:26:34.816 --> 01:26:35.817
What is that?

01:26:36.818 --> 01:26:38.111
You hear it, too?

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:40.947
I was hoping it was in my head.

01:26:48.079 --> 01:26:49.497
This is worse.

01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:52.625
- Hmm.

01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:57.964
Nature is most definitely...

01:26:58.756 --> 01:26:59.757
- Out of balance.
- Mmm.

01:27:10.977 --> 01:27:11.978
Hello again.

01:27:14.314 --> 01:27:15.773
Any chance you could...

01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:29.662
Atta boy! Yes! Thank you.

01:27:30.455 --> 01:27:31.456
Uh...

01:27:37.211 --> 01:27:38.212
Ah!

01:27:39.631 --> 01:27:41.507
Here we go, Okay, go!

01:27:49.057 --> 01:27:50.350
Thank you.

01:27:53.019 --> 01:27:55.229
Going, kemosabe?

01:27:55.355 --> 01:27:56.522
Uh-huh.

01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:58.483
To find Rebecca and Danny?

01:27:58.566 --> 01:27:59.651
Yup.

01:27:59.817 --> 01:28:01.694
- To capture Cavendish?
- That's right.

01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:03.196
Hmm.

01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:05.156
Where the river begins?

01:28:05.323 --> 01:28:06.532
Exactly.

01:28:09.869 --> 01:28:11.913
It is a good day to die.

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.040
Yeah, well,

01:28:14.207 --> 01:28:15.583
same to you.

01:28:16.084 --> 01:28:17.251
Come on.

01:28:32.058 --> 01:28:33.476
"Where the river begins."

01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:35.728
You know where that is, don't you?

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:48.408
Where the river begins.

01:29:03.089 --> 01:29:04.090
Oh!

01:29:04.215 --> 01:29:07.385
Sorry, Butch. it was a accident. I'm...

01:29:07.552 --> 01:29:09.012
I didn't mean it.

01:29:12.348 --> 01:29:14.684
What the hell is that damn noise?

01:29:17.854 --> 01:29:20.690
Sorry, Butch.
They say they won't go inside no more.

01:29:20.857 --> 01:29:22.942
Indian spirits or some damn thing.

01:29:23.067 --> 01:29:25.111
They say they causing the cave-ins.

01:29:26.696 --> 01:29:28.072
He the one doing the talking?

01:29:28.239 --> 01:29:29.574
That's right.

01:29:32.118 --> 01:29:34.162
Anybody else want to negotiate?

01:29:34.245 --> 01:29:35.246
You?

01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:39.709
They don't even speak English, Butch.

01:29:39.834 --> 01:29:41.669
I think they understood.

01:29:42.336 --> 01:29:44.964
Now go show them
there's nothing to be afraid of.

01:29:48.051 --> 01:29:50.011
Do I have to ask twice?

01:29:51.471 --> 01:29:53.347
I've been thinking.

01:29:55.141 --> 01:29:58.311
Why don't we just take
what we can carry

01:29:58.478 --> 01:29:59.937
and get out of here?

01:30:01.397 --> 01:30:04.317
I mean, hell, we already rich.

01:30:05.193 --> 01:30:06.235
Right?

01:30:08.362 --> 01:30:09.781
Scraps?

01:30:10.865 --> 01:30:11.949
Yeah.

01:30:12.784 --> 01:30:14.827
You think I waited 20 years

01:30:15.745 --> 01:30:17.538
for scraps?

01:30:18.456 --> 01:30:20.166
I'm taking all of it!

01:30:20.333 --> 01:30:21.375
Every damn piece!

01:30:21.501 --> 01:30:22.627
I'm sorry!

01:30:22.794 --> 01:30:26.047
Now, get in there
before I put a hole in you!

01:30:27.548 --> 01:30:28.674
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:30:29.008 --> 01:30:30.468
Get in there.

01:30:58.121 --> 01:30:59.413
Frank?

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:03.626
Ray,

01:31:04.961 --> 01:31:05.962
Skinny,

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.089
go get him.

01:31:08.756 --> 01:31:09.757
Frank?

01:32:24.498 --> 01:32:26.500
It can't be.

01:32:29.295 --> 01:32:31.631
The Rangers are dead.

01:32:40.139 --> 01:32:41.641
Where are they?

01:32:43.809 --> 01:32:44.852
You're dead.

01:32:49.357 --> 01:32:51.359
Rebecca and Danny.

01:32:51.525 --> 01:32:53.861
If you hurt them, I swear
to God, I'll make you pay.

01:32:56.155 --> 01:32:58.658
...to the full extent of the law.

01:32:59.283 --> 01:33:01.118
I'll be damned.

01:33:01.285 --> 01:33:03.955
Lawyer and a crazy Injun.

01:33:05.706 --> 01:33:06.832
Tell me.

01:33:13.881 --> 01:33:15.508
Had a nice smell on her.

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:17.510
Didn't she?

01:33:31.524 --> 01:33:32.525
See?

01:33:33.025 --> 01:33:35.027
You're no spirit.

01:33:35.486 --> 01:33:37.488
You're just a man in a mask.

01:33:39.865 --> 01:33:42.201
You're no different than me.

01:33:45.705 --> 01:33:47.498
Finish him.

01:33:47.915 --> 01:33:49.041
No.

01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:51.544
This isn't justice.

01:33:51.711 --> 01:33:53.421
Justice

01:33:53.546 --> 01:33:56.382
is what a man must take for himself.

01:33:58.217 --> 01:34:00.261
No, I can't believe that.

01:34:00.428 --> 01:34:01.721
I won't.

01:34:01.887 --> 01:34:04.265
Windigo cut out brother's heart.

01:34:05.266 --> 01:34:07.268
Where is brother's justice?

01:34:07.768 --> 01:34:09.603
I'm not a savage.

01:34:12.356 --> 01:34:14.233
You are not a man.

01:34:15.067 --> 01:34:17.028
- I will do it.
- Wait.

01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:23.242
You keep me from my destiny once.

01:34:23.409 --> 01:34:25.411
It will not happen again.

01:34:26.746 --> 01:34:28.748
Now, windigo must die.

01:34:28.914 --> 01:34:31.709
There's no such thing as a wendingo.

01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:34.003
You made it up.

01:34:34.587 --> 01:34:36.922
Like you make up everything.

01:34:37.089 --> 01:34:40.343
You sold out your whole village
for a watch.

01:34:40.509 --> 01:34:43.512
And now you're an outcast.
You're a band apart.

01:34:43.679 --> 01:34:44.680
A messed up little kid

01:34:44.764 --> 01:34:47.433
who couldn't live with what you did.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.353
There's no such thing as cursed silver,

01:34:50.561 --> 01:34:53.064
or a Spirit Walker for that matter.

01:34:53.773 --> 01:34:55.274
I'm not like you.

01:34:55.733 --> 01:34:56.942
I have a tribe.

01:35:00.029 --> 01:35:01.614
You have nothing.

01:35:02.114 --> 01:35:03.616
Like me.

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:07.119
You're wrong.

01:35:07.286 --> 01:35:10.706
Go back to your tribe, white coward.

01:35:11.957 --> 01:35:13.793
I do not need you.

01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:22.134
Look at me.

01:35:23.719 --> 01:35:26.472
See the face of my people

01:35:26.639 --> 01:35:28.099
as you die.

01:35:30.267 --> 01:35:32.520
I knew I could count on you, Counsellor.

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:34.188
Shut up.

01:35:58.254 --> 01:35:59.255
Hey.

01:35:59.839 --> 01:36:01.507
Where am I?

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.593
Drink.

01:36:05.719 --> 01:36:07.388
Feel better.

01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:24.196
Your tactics
have been most effective, Captain.

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.739
With the natives in retreat,

01:36:25.823 --> 01:36:27.575
we'll be in Promontory Summit
ahead of schedule.

01:36:27.658 --> 01:36:31.036
Believe me, what they have done to the
settlements we have given back tenfold.

01:36:32.872 --> 01:36:34.373
Tenfold.

01:36:38.169 --> 01:36:40.963
Danny, I told you,
take it easy on the corners

01:36:41.046 --> 01:36:42.756
and press down on the straightaway.

01:36:42.923 --> 01:36:44.884
It's just a toy.

01:36:47.011 --> 01:36:48.095
Come here, Danny.

01:36:48.262 --> 01:36:49.597
I want to show you something.

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.851
Since the time of Alexander the Great

01:36:54.018 --> 01:36:55.561
no man has travelled faster

01:36:55.644 --> 01:36:57.313
than the horse that carried him.

01:36:57.813 --> 01:36:59.315
Not any more.

01:36:59.732 --> 01:37:04.069
Imagine, an entire continent
connected by iron rail.

01:37:04.236 --> 01:37:07.156
That's fuel for our cities.
Metals for our factories.

01:37:07.323 --> 01:37:09.742
Food for the masses.

01:37:11.577 --> 01:37:14.079
Whoever controls this,

01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:16.415
controls the future.

01:37:16.957 --> 01:37:20.586
Power that makes emperors and kings

01:37:20.753 --> 01:37:22.087
look like fools.

01:37:26.759 --> 01:37:28.511
You mean it's mine?

01:37:28.677 --> 01:37:30.971
It could be, son.

01:37:31.764 --> 01:37:34.266
Could be all yours.

01:37:37.603 --> 01:37:39.647
Rebecca. Feeling better?

01:37:39.939 --> 01:37:42.149
Look what Mr Cole got me, Mama.

01:37:42.274 --> 01:37:43.275
Huh!

01:37:43.359 --> 01:37:44.735
Danny...

01:37:44.818 --> 01:37:45.819
Oh!

01:37:46.612 --> 01:37:48.280
Well, it was the least I could do

01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:49.657
after what you've been through.

01:37:49.782 --> 01:37:52.618
You should consider yourself
a lucky woman, Mrs Reid.

01:37:52.785 --> 01:37:54.995
Had Mr Cole not
come along when he did

01:37:55.162 --> 01:37:57.122
with those outlaws,
who knows what manner

01:37:57.206 --> 01:37:58.726
of violations might have transpired...

01:37:58.791 --> 01:38:00.125
Captain. Captain, please.

01:38:00.459 --> 01:38:01.460
The boy.

01:38:01.627 --> 01:38:03.045
We're indebted to you.

01:38:03.212 --> 01:38:05.798
Oh, no. It is I who is indebted.

01:38:05.965 --> 01:38:09.635
Ever since the war, I prayed
that God might send me

01:38:09.802 --> 01:38:12.888
a family that I could care for.

01:38:13.222 --> 01:38:14.807
And now he has.

01:38:15.474 --> 01:38:16.517
Wait.

01:38:17.351 --> 01:38:19.144
There's one left.

01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.980
- I'm sorry?
- A Ranger.

01:38:23.232 --> 01:38:24.316
A Ranger is still alive.

01:38:24.483 --> 01:38:25.568
No, ma'am.

01:38:25.734 --> 01:38:27.570
My troopers found seven graves.

01:38:27.736 --> 01:38:29.321
So, perhaps when you fell
and hit your head...

01:38:29.405 --> 01:38:30.406
Captain.

01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:33.784
If there is a Ranger still alive,

01:38:33.951 --> 01:38:36.954
we will scour the countryside
until we find him.

01:38:37.496 --> 01:38:39.164
I promise you that.

01:38:45.337 --> 01:38:46.797
<i>Heavenly Father,</i>

01:38:46.964 --> 01:38:50.342
<i>we call upon you in this,
our hour of need.</i>

01:38:52.011 --> 01:38:53.345
<i>For you are the shepherd</i>

01:38:53.512 --> 01:38:56.807
<i>that shall guide the wanderer
through the desert.</i>

01:38:56.974 --> 01:38:59.560
<i>You are the light
that shall be his beacon</i>

01:38:59.685 --> 01:39:01.186
<i>in the darkness.</i>

01:39:02.062 --> 01:39:04.398
<i>And yours is the mighty sword</i>

01:39:04.523 --> 01:39:06.734
<i>that shall strike down his enemies.</i>

01:39:07.234 --> 01:39:10.904
<i>For he is on the path of righteousness.</i>

01:39:12.156 --> 01:39:13.532
Amen.

01:39:25.336 --> 01:39:26.545
Latham Cole!

01:39:26.712 --> 01:39:28.232
Sir!
Someone's coming in!

01:39:28.255 --> 01:39:29.882
Sentries, at your posts!

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:39.391
- Daddy!
- Dan.

01:39:41.226 --> 01:39:42.227
We don't know who's out there.

01:39:42.311 --> 01:39:43.896
I intend to find out.

01:39:44.021 --> 01:39:45.314
Latham Cole!

01:39:45.397 --> 01:39:48.525
Wendell, take Mrs Reid
and her son to the supply car.

01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:50.486
For their own safety.

01:39:53.906 --> 01:39:54.907
What is it, friend?

01:39:58.869 --> 01:40:01.538
This is the man you've been looking for.

01:40:05.751 --> 01:40:07.086
Butch Cavendish,

01:40:07.419 --> 01:40:09.338
just like one of those great lizards

01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:10.881
buried in the desert.

01:40:11.048 --> 01:40:12.216
The last of a dying breed.

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.261
That's enough.

01:40:22.601 --> 01:40:24.770
I brought this man in for justice.

01:40:26.772 --> 01:40:28.107
Of course.

01:40:29.441 --> 01:40:31.568
Soldier.

01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:41.286
I'm just doing my job, Mrs Reid.

01:40:41.453 --> 01:40:42.496
You wanna keep me in this room,

01:40:42.579 --> 01:40:43.779
you're gonna have to shoot me.

01:40:44.081 --> 01:40:45.207
Is that part of your job?

01:40:47.668 --> 01:40:48.752
Whoa!

01:40:49.253 --> 01:40:50.421
Danny.

01:40:52.089 --> 01:40:53.841
And don't let him leave.

01:40:55.134 --> 01:40:56.385
But he's just a boy.

01:40:57.177 --> 01:40:58.345
That's right.

01:40:59.513 --> 01:41:00.597
Oh.

01:41:00.931 --> 01:41:02.808
And he's got a twitchy finger, too.

01:41:29.293 --> 01:41:31.211
Stupid white man.

01:41:35.174 --> 01:41:37.342
There were rumours
that sustained us.

01:41:37.509 --> 01:41:39.052
A lone Ranger,

01:41:39.344 --> 01:41:41.889
a masked man.

01:41:42.014 --> 01:41:45.476
A ghost, some people said.

01:41:46.351 --> 01:41:47.644
And now, here you are.

01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:51.190
Flesh and blood.

01:41:51.732 --> 01:41:53.901
Civilised society
has no place for a masked man.

01:41:54.026 --> 01:41:55.027
Of course not.

01:41:56.028 --> 01:41:58.197
How can I thank you
for what you've done?

01:41:58.864 --> 01:42:01.366
You can stop this war before it's too late.

01:42:01.533 --> 01:42:03.134
Comanche didn't attack
those settlements.

01:42:03.202 --> 01:42:05.621
It was Butch Cavendish and his gang.

01:42:06.705 --> 01:42:08.373
All for this.

01:42:16.048 --> 01:42:17.466
Butch Cavendish.

01:42:20.344 --> 01:42:22.554
In one man,

01:42:22.721 --> 01:42:25.724
everything I hate about this country.

01:42:26.517 --> 01:42:28.519
No sense of the common good.

01:42:29.561 --> 01:42:31.063
No vision.

01:42:33.232 --> 01:42:34.483
Come to think of it,

01:42:34.566 --> 01:42:37.361
not unlike your brother, Dan.

01:43:00.259 --> 01:43:04.179
Men like that can't accept
what we know to be true.

01:43:04.346 --> 01:43:06.265
A man can't stay the same

01:43:06.348 --> 01:43:09.351
with the world evolving around him.

01:43:24.825 --> 01:43:26.243
Remember me?

01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:29.663
But a man can't choose
his brother, can he?

01:43:30.289 --> 01:43:33.584
It's almost as if his brother chooses him.

01:43:35.210 --> 01:43:36.879
You see, that's what we are.

01:43:38.255 --> 01:43:39.423
Me and Butch.

01:43:39.882 --> 01:43:41.425
Brothers.

01:43:42.217 --> 01:43:44.177
Born in the desert.

01:43:44.344 --> 01:43:46.138
All those years ago.

01:43:50.267 --> 01:43:52.394
And now you've come back.

01:43:53.312 --> 01:43:54.771
Train tracks.

01:43:55.355 --> 01:43:57.733
That's what Dan found
in Indian Territory, isn't it?

01:43:57.900 --> 01:43:58.901
He knew there was gonna be a war

01:43:58.984 --> 01:43:59.985
and he wouldn't go along with it,

01:44:00.068 --> 01:44:01.570
so you had him killed.

01:44:01.737 --> 01:44:03.155
Like I said,

01:44:03.238 --> 01:44:04.281
no vision.

01:44:04.823 --> 01:44:06.950
Stop this train.

01:44:07.117 --> 01:44:09.286
Oh, there's no stopping this train, John.

01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:11.705
I think you know that.

01:44:24.176 --> 01:44:25.886
Danny!

01:44:27.346 --> 01:44:29.139
You're not my daddy.

01:44:29.556 --> 01:44:31.850
No. Put the gun down, son.

01:44:32.309 --> 01:44:33.769
Where's my daddy?

01:44:34.102 --> 01:44:35.479
He's dead, Danny.

01:44:37.022 --> 01:44:38.440
- He killed him.
- Shut up.

01:44:38.815 --> 01:44:39.816
Listen to me, Danny.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:41.318
You remember me, it's your Uncle John.

01:44:41.401 --> 01:44:43.528
You trust me, don't you, Danny?

01:44:43.862 --> 01:44:46.657
Look, Danny,
I'm gonna put my gun away, okay?

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.908
Nice and slow.

01:44:48.367 --> 01:44:49.785
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:44:51.536 --> 01:44:52.579
Shoot him, son.

01:44:56.416 --> 01:44:58.043
Danny?

01:44:59.544 --> 01:45:01.421
Is my daddy dead?

01:45:09.054 --> 01:45:10.222
Is he?

01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:14.226
Is he?

01:45:14.726 --> 01:45:16.436
Just put the gun down.

01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:18.897
Please?

01:45:22.150 --> 01:45:23.986
Now, just put the gun down.

01:45:40.252 --> 01:45:41.878
Captain, arrest these men.

01:45:41.962 --> 01:45:43.588
This man is a common criminal

01:45:43.672 --> 01:45:45.340
trespassing on railway property.

01:45:45.424 --> 01:45:47.342
Comanche never
raided any settlements.

01:45:47.426 --> 01:45:49.553
They staged the attacks
so they could violate the treaty.

01:45:49.636 --> 01:45:51.388
We've heard enough. Captain.

01:45:51.471 --> 01:45:53.015
You represent
the United States government.

01:45:53.098 --> 01:45:54.258
You do not work for this man!

01:45:54.307 --> 01:45:56.351
- Captain!
- They started this war!

01:45:56.435 --> 01:45:58.520
Well, if what you say is true,

01:45:58.603 --> 01:46:01.273
that would mean
I attacked the Comanche for no reason.

01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.899
That's right, Captain.

01:46:03.817 --> 01:46:06.153
Slaughter of the innocents.

01:46:06.319 --> 01:46:08.113
Their blood on your hands.

01:46:09.614 --> 01:46:11.450
Tenfold.

01:46:12.617 --> 01:46:14.828
Are you capable of that?

01:46:22.919 --> 01:46:24.629
Well, the way I see it,

01:46:24.796 --> 01:46:27.632
these men are with the rail road.

01:46:28.091 --> 01:46:29.801
So, the question is,

01:46:31.511 --> 01:46:33.013
who the hell are you?

01:46:51.907 --> 01:46:53.492
Clear the track, men!

01:46:53.575 --> 01:46:55.118
Outta the way!

01:47:10.175 --> 01:47:11.426
Going to pit!

01:47:19.518 --> 01:47:20.685
My God!

01:47:20.852 --> 01:47:22.646
Out here, it's just rock.

01:47:22.813 --> 01:47:25.440
Put it on a train, it's priceless.

01:47:25.607 --> 01:47:27.901
What could you buy with all of that?

01:47:29.778 --> 01:47:31.029
A country, Captain.

01:47:33.031 --> 01:47:34.574
A great country.

01:47:34.783 --> 01:47:37.035
For which our children will thank us.

01:47:39.079 --> 01:47:42.415
Take her ahead!
Line her up!

01:47:48.088 --> 01:47:49.172
You're lined up.

01:47:52.592 --> 01:47:54.352
That'll do!

01:47:55.637 --> 01:47:57.681
Get these Chinamen out of here!

01:47:57.848 --> 01:47:59.516
Move it, move it!

01:48:00.392 --> 01:48:02.727
Detail, halt!

01:48:05.313 --> 01:48:07.190
Order, up!

01:48:17.409 --> 01:48:19.244
Didn't you hear me, Chinaman?

01:48:19.494 --> 01:48:21.496
I said, get out!

01:48:24.124 --> 01:48:25.542
Port arms!

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.173
Please, don't do this.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:39.055
You'll take care of us, like you said.

01:48:40.599 --> 01:48:42.184
You don't have to do this.

01:48:43.143 --> 01:48:44.769
Load!

01:48:50.150 --> 01:48:52.110
I ain't gonna tell you again!

01:48:58.116 --> 01:48:59.367
What the hell is that?

01:49:04.331 --> 01:49:07.209
Gas. That's gas!

01:49:07.292 --> 01:49:08.460
- What'd he say?

01:49:08.543 --> 01:49:09.823
Gas! Get out of there!

01:49:10.295 --> 01:49:11.546
She's going to blow!

01:49:17.802 --> 01:49:19.137
Shoulder arms!

01:49:21.056 --> 01:49:22.641
I was at Gettysburg.

01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:26.019
Twelve-thousand casualties
before lunch.

01:49:27.145 --> 01:49:29.439
Know what I learned in all that carnage?

01:49:29.606 --> 01:49:33.526
Nothing is accomplished
without sacrifice.

01:49:37.656 --> 01:49:39.616
- Leave her alone!
- Danny!

01:49:41.159 --> 01:49:42.160
Nice and easy!

01:49:42.244 --> 01:49:44.412
Gas! Oh, Lord! Gas!

01:49:44.496 --> 01:49:45.497
What the hell?

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:46.957
Gas! Gas! Gas!

01:49:48.792 --> 01:49:50.460
Ready!

01:49:50.794 --> 01:49:52.837
I'm gonna have to
teach you about respect, aren't I, son?

01:49:52.921 --> 01:49:53.922
No!

01:49:55.548 --> 01:49:56.758
Aim!

01:50:00.512 --> 01:50:01.638
Fire!

01:50:03.265 --> 01:50:04.266
Oh!

01:50:12.941 --> 01:50:14.192
What the hell just happened?

01:50:53.732 --> 01:50:55.525
Get the train moving!

01:51:00.155 --> 01:51:03.491
Attack!
Maintain order! To arms!

01:51:03.575 --> 01:51:05.035
Hold on, kemosabe.

01:51:05.577 --> 01:51:06.578
Tonto?

01:51:09.247 --> 01:51:10.582
What was that?

01:51:10.749 --> 01:51:12.083
No reason for concern.

01:51:12.208 --> 01:51:14.085
Over here! To the guns!

01:51:14.502 --> 01:51:16.504
Defensive position!

01:51:17.255 --> 01:51:18.256
John!

01:51:19.174 --> 01:51:21.217
Rebecca! I'm coming for you!

01:51:21.301 --> 01:51:22.427
John!

01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:24.012
Rally on me!

01:51:35.523 --> 01:51:36.691
Lord, save us.

01:51:41.446 --> 01:51:43.365
Faster! Now!

01:51:45.116 --> 01:51:47.077
Form a firing line!

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:48.745
Come this way. Fall in on me.

01:51:52.082 --> 01:51:53.750
Hold your positions, gentlemen!

01:51:55.585 --> 01:51:56.878
Hold!

01:51:57.879 --> 01:51:59.589
Steady!

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.051
For God!

01:52:04.511 --> 01:52:06.179
And for country!

01:52:09.682 --> 01:52:10.892
Fire at Will!

01:52:15.313 --> 01:52:18.108
Tonto? What is that?

01:52:27.575 --> 01:52:29.577
Now... must to jump!

01:52:30.078 --> 01:52:31.079
Left or right?

01:52:31.162 --> 01:52:32.330
Yes!

01:52:50.098 --> 01:52:51.850
Kerosene?

01:52:52.016 --> 01:52:54.394
What are you trying to do?
Blow up the whole mountain?

01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:58.857
Trust me. These two have
a hard time staying dead.

01:53:20.086 --> 01:53:21.337
Cover the flank!

01:55:02.188 --> 01:55:03.606
Mister Tonto?

01:55:06.526 --> 01:55:07.944
Mister Tonto?

01:55:09.571 --> 01:55:11.406
You mean, they killed all of them?

01:55:12.448 --> 01:55:15.577
The Indians, the settlers...

01:55:16.202 --> 01:55:17.328
Dan?

01:55:17.954 --> 01:55:19.080
For silver?

01:55:23.918 --> 01:55:25.795
<i>You were right.</i>

01:55:26.170 --> 01:55:28.047
There is no justice.

01:55:29.007 --> 01:55:31.426
Cole controls everything.

01:55:32.093 --> 01:55:35.346
The rail road, the Cavalry,

01:55:36.431 --> 01:55:37.765
everything.

01:55:40.643 --> 01:55:43.313
If men like him represent the law,

01:55:43.479 --> 01:55:45.648
I'd rather be an outlaw.

01:55:48.818 --> 01:55:50.486
That is why

01:55:51.613 --> 01:55:53.406
you wear the mask.

01:56:11.716 --> 01:56:15.094
Something very wrong with that horse.

01:56:26.105 --> 01:56:27.774
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:30.485
we are here today to celebrate a dream.

01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:33.279
And now I'd like to introduce the man

01:56:33.446 --> 01:56:35.239
who made that dream a reality.

01:56:35.406 --> 01:56:37.033
Chairman of the Transcontinental

01:56:37.116 --> 01:56:39.077
Railroad Corporation,

01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:40.536
Mr Lewis Habberman the Third.

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:41.913
Thank you!

01:56:42.246 --> 01:56:45.249
But I cannot take credit alone.

01:56:45.458 --> 01:56:46.584
No, sir.

01:56:46.751 --> 01:56:50.630
The working men before you
deserve your applause!

01:56:50.755 --> 01:56:52.173
- Yes!

01:56:52.924 --> 01:56:56.427
As does one man in particular,

01:56:56.511 --> 01:57:00.515
and a more dedicated, loyal employee

01:57:00.598 --> 01:57:02.892
the rail road could not ask for,

01:57:02.975 --> 01:57:04.352
Mr Latham Cole!

01:57:07.188 --> 01:57:08.940
- Come on.
- Good man.

01:57:09.524 --> 01:57:10.525
Bravo, sir.

01:57:11.192 --> 01:57:12.610
Mr Cole!

01:57:13.444 --> 01:57:16.447
A testament of our thanks.

01:57:21.494 --> 01:57:22.620
Cheers!

01:58:01.492 --> 01:58:03.202
<i>You missed something.</i>

01:58:03.369 --> 01:58:04.996
Where did you get the explosives?

01:58:06.164 --> 01:58:07.832
I told you.

01:58:08.458 --> 01:58:09.500
No, you didn't.

01:58:11.544 --> 01:58:15.173
But you had a plan. I mean,
he didn't get away with it?

01:58:15.506 --> 01:58:17.175
We had plan.

01:58:20.136 --> 01:58:22.180
It was good plan.

01:58:26.517 --> 01:58:27.894
This is a damn bank robbery!

01:58:40.406 --> 01:58:42.158
Oh, Mr Habberman,

01:58:42.241 --> 01:58:43.367
if you and the other shareholders

01:58:43.493 --> 01:58:44.453
would like to follow me,

01:58:44.535 --> 01:58:45.912
I have a little surprise for you.

01:58:46.037 --> 01:58:47.163
Ah!

01:58:51.751 --> 01:58:52.877
Oh, my.

01:58:55.505 --> 01:58:56.923
What was that?

01:58:57.089 --> 01:59:00.343
Tunnelling for supply routes.
Nothing to be concerned about.

01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:02.053
This way, gentlemen.

01:59:05.014 --> 01:59:06.557
Bring the girl.

01:59:16.275 --> 01:59:17.568
He's coming for you.

01:59:17.902 --> 01:59:19.737
Just like Frank said.

01:59:20.571 --> 01:59:22.198
What you got makes them Reid boys

01:59:22.281 --> 01:59:24.075
so hot under the collar, anyway?

01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:28.246
Maybe I'll have a taste and find out.

01:59:28.412 --> 01:59:30.289
The men around this table represent

01:59:30.414 --> 01:59:32.375
the finest families in our country

01:59:32.458 --> 01:59:33.918
as well as controlling interest

01:59:34.043 --> 01:59:36.295
in the Transcontinental
Railway Corporation.

01:59:36.462 --> 01:59:38.089
Hear, hear!

01:59:38.256 --> 01:59:39.340
What you cannot know

01:59:39.423 --> 01:59:40.758
is that over the past six months,

01:59:40.842 --> 01:59:42.260
I have leveraged a position

01:59:42.385 --> 01:59:44.595
which will make me
the majority shareholder

01:59:44.679 --> 01:59:47.598
when this company is
listed Monday morning

01:59:47.723 --> 01:59:50.268
on the New York City Stock Exchange.

01:59:50.434 --> 01:59:53.521
In essence, gentlemen, you work for me.

01:59:53.604 --> 01:59:55.523
Have you lost your mind?

01:59:55.606 --> 01:59:56.858
Do you have any idea the cost?

01:59:57.191 --> 01:59:59.193
Each one of those freight cars contains

01:59:59.277 --> 02:00:01.362
4.5 tons of purest raw silver.

02:00:01.445 --> 02:00:03.447
When it reaches the bank
in San Francisco,

02:00:03.531 --> 02:00:05.449
that's 65 million dollars.

02:00:05.616 --> 02:00:07.785
It's what you might call
a hostile takeover.

02:00:08.119 --> 02:00:10.538
You can keep the watch.

02:00:16.836 --> 02:00:18.963
Have you checked the undercarriage?

02:00:19.839 --> 02:00:21.799
- Check it again.
- Yes, sir.

02:00:26.554 --> 02:00:28.431
Pleasure to see you, Red!

02:00:33.644 --> 02:00:34.687
Oh!

02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:37.315
May I be of some
assistance to you, madam?

02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:39.901
Seems I have a run in my stocking.

02:00:41.652 --> 02:00:43.362
Ivory.

02:00:52.538 --> 02:00:53.938
Hurry up with them grapes.

02:00:54.999 --> 02:00:56.042
Shh!

02:00:58.878 --> 02:01:00.546
Make trade.

02:01:05.885 --> 02:01:07.011
Hey, boy!

02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:10.389
Boy, I'm talking to you!

02:01:13.768 --> 02:01:15.519
Hey! You can't leave that here!

02:01:15.686 --> 02:01:19.023
Mr Cole's pickles. Take it up with him.

02:01:19.190 --> 02:01:21.192
This is an outrage!

02:01:21.359 --> 02:01:23.611
I, for one, am not gonna sit here

02:01:23.694 --> 02:01:25.863
and negotiate with one of my employees.

02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:28.032
Then, let's get down to it, shall we?

02:01:33.704 --> 02:01:34.664
My gluteus!

02:01:34.747 --> 02:01:36.958
Gentlemen, our chairman
has had to take

02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:39.085
- a sudden leave of absence.

02:01:39.210 --> 02:01:40.878
Any nominations?

02:01:43.756 --> 02:01:47.593
I nominate Mr Latham Cole.

02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:48.970
I accept.

02:02:01.774 --> 02:02:02.942
It's magnificent.

02:02:04.026 --> 02:02:05.069
So clean.

02:02:05.236 --> 02:02:06.570
You want to touch it?

02:02:07.571 --> 02:02:08.698
Oh, yes.

02:02:12.451 --> 02:02:13.911
Attention!

02:02:14.203 --> 02:02:15.246
About face!

02:02:16.414 --> 02:02:18.374
Everyone wants to touch it.

02:02:25.673 --> 02:02:27.675
What the hell do you think you're doing?

02:02:27.758 --> 02:02:28.759
Robbery.

02:02:28.926 --> 02:02:30.720
We don't have no money here, boy.

02:02:33.264 --> 02:02:34.932
Train robbery.

02:02:35.099 --> 02:02:36.559
A little higher.

02:02:36.726 --> 02:02:38.394
How high does it go?

02:02:38.561 --> 02:02:39.770
Almost there.

02:02:40.563 --> 02:02:45.151
<i>...land of the free</i>

02:02:45.943 --> 02:02:52.366
<i>and the home of the brave</i>

02:03:01.876 --> 02:03:02.877
Um...

02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:04.462
Mr Cole?

02:03:05.379 --> 02:03:06.964
They're stealing my train.

02:03:07.798 --> 02:03:09.592
Get the horses!

02:03:09.759 --> 02:03:10.968
Right

02:03:12.803 --> 02:03:13.804
there!

02:03:23.647 --> 02:03:25.483
What are you waiting for? To the engine!

02:03:27.234 --> 02:03:29.236
Stop that train!

02:03:35.451 --> 02:03:36.827
Shoot him, you idiot.

02:03:37.328 --> 02:03:38.746
- No, Danny's in there!
- That's an order!

02:03:38.829 --> 02:03:39.830
Mama!

02:03:46.837 --> 02:03:48.172
I've been shot!

02:03:48.672 --> 02:03:50.341
- There he is, men!

02:04:08.776 --> 02:04:10.277
John!

02:04:17.785 --> 02:04:18.953
John!

02:04:32.883 --> 02:04:34.051
Come on!

02:05:00.703 --> 02:05:02.371
Get me close!

02:06:04.767 --> 02:06:07.061
The Ranger! He's on the roof!

02:06:10.272 --> 02:06:13.317
How many times
do I have to tell you to kill that Ranger?

02:06:13.984 --> 02:06:15.611
I told you he'd come.

02:06:37.841 --> 02:06:39.677
<i>Adiós,</i> Counsellor!

02:06:41.512 --> 02:06:42.596
John!

02:07:12.543 --> 02:07:14.670
Dance, monkey! Dance!

02:07:15.337 --> 02:07:16.672
Oh! Ooh!

02:07:24.805 --> 02:07:25.848
Danny!

02:08:24.698 --> 02:08:26.283
Butch Cavendish!

02:08:28.619 --> 02:08:30.037
Let her go!

02:08:30.371 --> 02:08:31.747
If you insist.

02:08:35.292 --> 02:08:36.293
Go ahead.

02:08:37.586 --> 02:08:38.587
John?

02:08:39.296 --> 02:08:40.964
She tends to land on her feet.

02:08:41.298 --> 02:08:42.383
John!

02:08:43.801 --> 02:08:44.968
Oh!

02:08:48.263 --> 02:08:49.598
What you gonna do, Counsellor?

02:08:50.432 --> 02:08:52.142
Shoot me?

02:08:54.061 --> 02:08:55.062
That's right.

02:09:00.484 --> 02:09:02.820
Guess I cut out
the wrong brother's heart.

02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.660
Don't tell me.
You boxed in law school.

02:09:12.663 --> 02:09:13.831
What the hell?

02:09:17.084 --> 02:09:18.961
As a matter of fact, I did.

02:10:07.718 --> 02:10:08.719
Where is girl?

02:10:09.011 --> 02:10:11.138
What? Where's the silver?

02:10:13.807 --> 02:10:15.476
What are you...

02:10:40.167 --> 02:10:41.752
End of the line.

02:10:43.712 --> 02:10:45.672
We've been here before, haven't we?

02:10:46.256 --> 02:10:47.674
Easy.

02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:57.768
Where did you say
that train was headed?

02:10:57.935 --> 02:10:59.603
The future?

02:11:02.731 --> 02:11:06.068
Well, this here train,
she going straight to hell.

02:11:16.912 --> 02:11:19.039
You know something, Butch?
I believe you're right.

02:11:22.376 --> 02:11:23.460
Enjoy the ride!

02:11:32.427 --> 02:11:33.470
Huh?

02:11:49.778 --> 02:11:50.779
Hey!

02:11:53.282 --> 02:11:54.324
Wrong brother?

02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.993
Not today.

02:12:27.232 --> 02:12:28.525
Time's up, Indian.

02:12:30.861 --> 02:12:31.903
Uncle John!

02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:50.339
Pretty soon, no one will even know
you people were here.

02:12:50.714 --> 02:12:52.883
I'm a Spirit Walker.

02:12:54.176 --> 02:12:55.719
I can't miss.

02:13:08.732 --> 02:13:09.775
All these years,

02:13:09.941 --> 02:13:12.694
I think you are windigo.

02:13:13.195 --> 02:13:14.196
But, no.

02:13:16.573 --> 02:13:18.617
You are just another white man.

02:13:20.077 --> 02:13:21.244
Who are you?

02:13:24.748 --> 02:13:26.041
Bad trade.

02:13:38.136 --> 02:13:39.721
<i>You let him get away?</i>

02:13:40.931 --> 02:13:42.057
No.

02:13:44.601 --> 02:13:46.436
The bridge.

02:13:48.105 --> 02:13:49.773
What bridge?

02:13:59.658 --> 02:14:01.076
Oh, my.

02:14:02.786 --> 02:14:04.454
"Bad trade."

02:15:08.685 --> 02:15:10.979
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:15:11.146 --> 02:15:14.357
as Chairman of the
Transcontinental Railroad,

02:15:14.524 --> 02:15:16.693
I'd like to express our gratitude

02:15:16.818 --> 02:15:19.196
to this masked man,

02:15:19.362 --> 02:15:23.074
this Lone Ranger.

02:15:23.241 --> 02:15:24.701
- Hear, hear.

02:15:25.869 --> 02:15:27.204
Come on, come on.

02:15:28.663 --> 02:15:32.209
A small token of our thanks.

02:15:36.505 --> 02:15:38.346
There will be plenty more
where that came from.

02:15:40.634 --> 02:15:44.554
Always nice to have a lawman
on the side of progress.

02:15:49.476 --> 02:15:51.812
Time to take off the mask, son.

02:16:00.821 --> 02:16:01.905
Not yet.

02:16:24.719 --> 02:16:25.720
I can't stay.

02:16:27.681 --> 02:16:28.932
I know.

02:16:31.184 --> 02:16:33.186
But if that badge
ever starts to weigh on you,

02:16:35.522 --> 02:16:38.859
well, you know where to find us.

02:16:39.401 --> 02:16:41.236
Train's headed west.

02:16:42.111 --> 02:16:44.114
There's nothing
holding you here any more.

02:16:45.615 --> 02:16:47.742
It's my home.

02:16:54.708 --> 02:16:57.127
You're not a boy
any more, Danny.

02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:00.964
Your daddy would be proud.

02:17:02.465 --> 02:17:04.425
You take care of your mama.

02:17:40.295 --> 02:17:42.339
I thought I'd call him Silver.

02:17:43.715 --> 02:17:44.924
Silver?

02:17:45.967 --> 02:17:47.761
It is a good name.

02:17:49.804 --> 02:17:51.181
You know, it isn't really a trade

02:17:51.263 --> 02:17:53.391
unless both parties agree.

02:17:53.558 --> 02:17:56.645
Who would really trade
a watch for some bird seed?

02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.484
Bird cannot tell time, kemosabe.

02:18:06.362 --> 02:18:08.281
"Kemosabe." Yeah, about that.

02:18:08.448 --> 02:18:10.075
Look, I was thinking,
if we're gonna be outlaws,

02:18:10.241 --> 02:18:11.700
I'm gonna need a better name.

02:18:11.868 --> 02:18:14.995
I was thinking, "The Mask of Justice."

02:18:15.163 --> 02:18:16.373
No.

02:18:16.831 --> 02:18:18.415
What about,
"The Lone Rider of..."

02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:19.501
No.

02:18:19.959 --> 02:18:22.045
Do you know
what "Tonto" means in Spanish?

02:18:41.064 --> 02:18:43.066
I guess I should be heading home.

02:18:44.401 --> 02:18:45.652
Home.

02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:51.574
It was nice to meet you, Mr Tonto.

02:19:00.834 --> 02:19:03.169
So, the windigo.

02:19:03.335 --> 02:19:05.004
Nature out of balance.

02:19:05.171 --> 02:19:06.923
The masked man.

02:19:08.258 --> 02:19:10.593
It's just a story, right?

02:19:11.593 --> 02:19:14.097
I mean, I know he's not real.

02:19:15.014 --> 02:19:16.766
Was he?

02:19:17.433 --> 02:19:20.602
Up to you, kemosabe.

02:20:00.810 --> 02:20:03.313
Never take off the mask.

02:20:05.523 --> 02:20:09.110
Hi-yo, Silver! Away!

02:20:12.655 --> 02:20:14.949
Don't ever do that again.

02:20:18.328 --> 02:20:20.121
Sorry.
