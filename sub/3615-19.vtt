WEBVTT

00:02.501 --> 00:05.275
I don't think we're gonna be
able to pull this off.

00:05.375 --> 00:05.899
We have to.

00:05.999 --> 00:08.150
We've been in tighter
jams than this before.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.109
But we're running out of time.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.651
I don't think
we're gonna make it.

00:10.751 --> 00:13.459
Phoebe, we can do this. Okay?

00:13.999 --> 00:14.454
I mean, if we just

00:14.464 --> 00:15.609
get a quick bite
to eat at Reds,

00:15.709 --> 00:17.526
we can still make
the 9:30 <i>Faithless</i>

00:17.626 --> 00:18.609
at the Avalon.

00:18.709 --> 00:19.567
The foreign film?

00:19.667 --> 00:21.734
I thought we were gonna
go see a thriller.

00:21.834 --> 00:22.899
No, Leo, I want to stop thinking

00:22.999 --> 00:26.899
about Cole and his demon
dodging, not be reminded of it.

00:26.999 --> 00:28.317
Piper...

00:28.417 --> 00:29.818
Leo, it
is three votes

00:29.918 --> 00:30.899
for <i>Faithless.</i>

00:30.999 --> 00:32.275
Well, a thriller

00:32.375 --> 00:33.150
would be okay.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.317
PRUE:
Okay, wait a second.

00:34.417 --> 00:36.250
The vote's two against two?

00:36.999 --> 00:37.899
That's new.

00:37.999 --> 00:39.567
Welcome to the power of four.

00:39.667 --> 00:40.900
PHOEBE:
I demand a recount.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.818
Wait... that never works.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.375
(<i>chuckling</i>)

00:45.959 --> 00:46.942
LEO:
Something tells me

00:47.042 --> 00:50.792
you're not gonna want
to see either movie now.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.442
Hey.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.417
Hey.

01:06.999 --> 01:08.818
I was so worried.

01:08.918 --> 01:09.526
I know, I'm sorry.

01:09.626 --> 01:12.067
I couldn't come back
until it was safe.

01:12.167 --> 01:14.899
It's safe now?

01:14.999 --> 01:16.317
I think so.

01:16.417 --> 01:18.042
For the moment.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.818
PRUE:
Hey.

01:27.918 --> 01:28.899
Welcome back.

01:28.999 --> 01:29.899
Thanks.

01:29.999 --> 01:31.109
Glad to be back.

01:31.209 --> 01:32.275
PIPER:
Love to chat,

01:32.375 --> 01:33.651
but we're late for a movie.

01:33.751 --> 01:34.484
LEO:
You want to go?

01:34.584 --> 01:35.609
We could use a tie breaker.

01:35.709 --> 01:39.025
Actually, I was hoping Phoebe
and I could catch up, alone.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.999
Works for me. Ciao.

01:42.792 --> 01:46.192
Look at Phoebe and Cole
trying to be a normal couple.

01:46.292 --> 01:47.401
You know
what that means.

01:47.501 --> 01:49.067
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're gonna go

01:49.167 --> 01:49.899
see the thriller.

01:49.999 --> 01:52.317
As if we don't have
enough scary bad guys

01:52.417 --> 01:53.275
in our real life.

01:53.375 --> 01:56.125
All right,
come on.

01:58.876 --> 02:00.899
I was starting to worry
that you weren't gonna

02:00.999 --> 02:03.275
make it back
in time for my graduation.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.484
Wouldn't miss that
for the world.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.250
Or the underworld.

02:09.209 --> 02:11.900
It's really not safe
for you here, is it?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.025
Uh, no, uh,
yeah, it is.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.899
I mean...
At least I think so.

02:17.999 --> 02:20.609
Then what's wrong?

02:20.709 --> 02:23.442
Truth is, I don't know

02:23.542 --> 02:25.942
how much longer
I can keep doing this.

02:26.042 --> 02:28.317
Doing what?

02:28.417 --> 02:31.484
You know, the running
and hiding.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.192
Even if I stop,
where do I go?

02:33.292 --> 02:35.401
I'm still half-human,
but I can't go back.

02:35.501 --> 02:37.692
On the other hand,
there's really no place

02:37.792 --> 02:39.234
for me in your world either.

02:39.334 --> 02:42.776
What are you saying?

02:42.876 --> 02:46.459
I'm just
saying it's complicated.

02:46.999 --> 02:49.899
But it doesn't have to be,
not with magic on our side.

02:49.999 --> 02:50.859
And I've been thinking,

02:50.959 --> 02:52.275
isn't there some kind
of spell or something

02:52.375 --> 02:54.692
in the <i>Book of Shadows</i>
that could strip my powers?

02:54.792 --> 02:58.899
Y-You... You want
to give up your powers?

02:58.999 --> 03:01.899
If I don't have them,
I can't be tempted to use them.

03:01.999 --> 03:02.899
I could just stay good.

03:02.999 --> 03:06.834
You would do that for me?

03:08.417 --> 03:12.983
MAN:
Prepare for
the brotherhood!

03:13.083 --> 03:14.192
Cole, what is it?

03:14.292 --> 03:16.776
The Thorn is coming!

03:16.876 --> 03:19.150
Stop
the Brotherhood!

03:19.250 --> 03:21.900
No Luxirom!

03:22.000 --> 03:22.899
Do you know him?

03:22.999 --> 03:26.417
No, but if he doesn't watch
what he's saying...

03:26.999 --> 03:28.025
(<i>gasping</i>)

03:28.125 --> 03:29.792
Phoebe, don't.

03:32.999 --> 03:34.000
No!

03:40.083 --> 03:42.899

03:42.999 --> 03:44.734

03:49.125 --> 03:50.792

03:55.792 --> 03:57.209
Where were you?

03:58.626 --> 03:59.818
What happened to you?

03:59.918 --> 04:03.417
You just vanquished my brother.

05:37.417 --> 05:40.818
PHOEBE:
You know Cole, there's plenty
 working against us.

05:40.918 --> 05:41.899
I just thought at least

05:41.999 --> 05:44.651
I could count on you
being honest with me.

05:44.751 --> 05:45.109
I am.

05:45.209 --> 05:47.609
Okay, so you just forgot
that you had a brother?

05:47.709 --> 05:48.859
He's not that
kind of brother.

05:48.959 --> 05:50.899
How many other kinds of
brothers are there?

05:50.999 --> 05:51.899
It's complicated.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.899
You know,
I hate that word.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.899
PIPER:
All right, we were just about

05:54.999 --> 05:56.900
to find out who
the real killer is

05:57.000 --> 05:58.025
and the pager goes off.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.818
So this better be
a really good emergency.

06:00.918 --> 06:02.692
Well, I'm the real killer.

06:02.792 --> 06:04.692
I just vanquished
Cole's brother.

06:04.792 --> 06:07.692
Whoa, this is so much
better than the movie.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.359
I didn't want him to see me.

06:09.459 --> 06:11.734
And we lost an innocent
because of it.

06:11.834 --> 06:12.776
Some poor

06:12.876 --> 06:16.899
street prophet who was ranting
about the Brotherhood.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.526
LEO:
The Brotherhood?

06:18.626 --> 06:19.484
Of the Thorn?

06:19.584 --> 06:20.484
COLE:
Yeah.

06:20.584 --> 06:22.526
I was a member. Am a member.

06:22.626 --> 06:24.150
What does that mean?

06:24.250 --> 06:25.067
What does
he mean?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.192
You should have told us.

06:26.292 --> 06:27.899
I've done a lot
in the last hundred years.

06:27.999 --> 06:29.692
It's gonna take
a while to catch you up.

06:29.792 --> 06:30.899
Okay, so who are they?

06:30.999 --> 06:32.234
LEO:
They're an elite gang.

06:32.334 --> 06:33.899
They answer
directly

06:33.999 --> 06:35.109
to the Source.

06:35.209 --> 06:36.162
He selects
the members himself.

06:36.172 --> 06:40.899
Then they take a blood oath,
a lifelong pledge of loyalty.

06:40.999 --> 06:44.042
Oh, that kind of brother.

06:44.667 --> 06:45.859
All that
matters now

06:45.959 --> 06:47.150
is that
they're surfacing.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.025
They must have
something big
in the works.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.526
But why kill a crazy
old street preacher?

06:52.626 --> 06:55.692
Because not all
of them are
crazy... or human.

06:55.792 --> 06:57.359
Some of them
are magical seers

06:57.459 --> 06:59.734
who can foresee
actual events,
but they're loud

06:59.834 --> 07:02.501
and dirty, so
people ignore them.

07:03.876 --> 07:05.899
You should call
Inspector Morris.

07:05.999 --> 07:08.317
I'll bet he'll tell you other
prophets have been killed, too.

07:08.417 --> 07:12.983
For what? Just for talking
about your... this gang?

07:13.083 --> 07:13.899
The Brotherhood can't risk

07:13.999 --> 07:15.899
anyone figuring out
what they're up to.

07:15.999 --> 07:18.317
Okay. So what
<i>are</i> they up to?

07:18.417 --> 07:19.150
I have no idea.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.776
I'm not exactly a member

07:20.876 --> 07:22.234
in good standing anymore.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.234
The prophet that
I tried to save

07:24.334 --> 07:25.899
was talking about Luxirom.

07:25.999 --> 07:26.900
The Internet provider?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.983
What? The demons want
their own Web site now?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.192
No. There must be more
to it than that.

07:31.292 --> 07:32.776
All right. Phoebe,
you check the Net. Piper,

07:32.876 --> 07:35.275
you got the <i>Book
of Shadows.</i> Uh...
Save it.

07:35.375 --> 07:38.692
You can't stop the Brotherhood
with a little research

07:38.792 --> 07:41.776
and your basic kick,
freeze and magical move.

07:41.876 --> 07:42.983
No offense intended.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.317
Some taken.

07:44.417 --> 07:45.109
No. He's right.

07:45.209 --> 07:47.942
They're way beyond
anything you've
dealt with before.

07:48.042 --> 07:50.192
We can't just let them go.

07:50.292 --> 07:51.275
There's got
to be a way

07:51.375 --> 07:53.484
to find out what
they're planning.

07:53.584 --> 07:55.999
There is one way.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.899
For me to go back.

07:58.999 --> 07:59.818
Cole...

07:59.918 --> 08:00.818
If you want to find out

08:00.918 --> 08:02.899
what they're up to,
we have no choice.

08:02.999 --> 08:06.859
Okay, but you'll be exposing
yourself to the Source.

08:06.959 --> 08:08.109
He'll kill you.

08:08.209 --> 08:09.192
Maybe not.

08:09.292 --> 08:11.484
They've probably
already surfaced--

08:11.584 --> 08:12.899
set up camp in this world.

08:12.999 --> 08:14.942
I won't have to go under
completely.

08:15.042 --> 08:17.359
It... does...
kind of make sense.

08:17.459 --> 08:19.484
Well, of course
it makes sense to you, Prue.

08:19.584 --> 08:21.899
You're always
looking for a way to get Cole

08:21.999 --> 08:23.899
out of our lives.
Phoebe.

08:23.999 --> 08:27.067
This isn't about her, Phoebe.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.818
It's about me.

08:28.918 --> 08:32.999
No. It's about us.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.818
We might
have a problem.

08:47.918 --> 08:48.818
One of the prophets?

08:48.918 --> 08:50.484
No. All the ones
we've targeted

08:50.584 --> 08:52.899
have been
taken out,
including Trigg.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.442
So what's the problem?

08:54.542 --> 08:55.401
Trigg's missing.

08:55.501 --> 08:58.359
I haven't been able
to find him anywhere.

08:58.459 --> 08:59.192
Which means

08:59.292 --> 09:00.567
someone is onto our plan.

09:00.667 --> 09:04.651
Impossible... as long
as the prophets are dead.

09:04.751 --> 09:06.442
Keep searching
for our brother.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.899
I have to complete
my assimilation.

09:08.999 --> 09:10.876
We must move forward.

09:17.417 --> 09:20.609
I'm worried, and not just
about Cole, but also Phoebe.

09:20.709 --> 09:21.899
I mean, sending
him back under

09:21.999 --> 09:24.150
is like sending
an alcoholic
to a kegger.

09:24.250 --> 09:25.900
It's setting
him up to fall.

09:26.000 --> 09:26.899
I agree.

09:26.999 --> 09:27.899
All right, look.

09:27.999 --> 09:29.609
This whole
voting-together thing

09:29.709 --> 09:31.899
would be really,
really cute if it weren't

09:31.999 --> 09:34.651
so annoying. I mean,
maybe you guys' vote

09:34.751 --> 09:36.609
should just count as one
from now on.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.567
Bet you wouldn't mind
if we were voting with you.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.109
I mean, what if
we lose him, Prue?
You don't want

09:41.209 --> 09:42.401
that responsibility, do you?

09:42.501 --> 09:45.317
Okay, look. The only votes that
count are Phoebe and Cole's,

09:45.417 --> 09:46.526
and Cole has already
volunteered.

09:46.626 --> 09:48.776
Well, then maybe Phoebe
can talk him out of it.

09:48.876 --> 09:51.067
Right. Which is why
we need another plan.

09:51.167 --> 09:51.734
So you guys work

09:51.834 --> 09:53.401
on the <i>Book of Shadows
</i> together, and I will

09:53.501 --> 09:56.999
call Morris
and see what he knows.

09:59.501 --> 10:00.899
Phoebe,
I have to go.

10:00.999 --> 10:03.067
Nope. You can't.

10:03.167 --> 10:03.900
Phoebe...

10:04.000 --> 10:05.692
Remember that
power-stripping potion

10:05.792 --> 10:08.359
you asked me for,
like, an hour ago,

10:08.459 --> 10:11.359
when everything
was still wonderful?

10:11.459 --> 10:12.900
Well, I have an idea.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.899
I just need some time.

10:14.999 --> 10:16.484
Phoebe...

10:16.584 --> 10:17.359
I have to go.

10:17.459 --> 10:19.609
And I'll need my powers
while I'm gone.

10:19.709 --> 10:21.942
Why? What are you going to do?

10:22.042 --> 10:22.899
Just blend in.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.899
That's it. I won't
do anything evil.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.751
Well, let me
make sure you can't.

10:38.042 --> 10:39.651
I'll be smart.

10:39.751 --> 10:40.899
And careful.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.899
I'll check in with you
every two hours.

10:42.999 --> 10:45.776
How? They'll
track your shimmer.

10:45.876 --> 10:47.150
Not if we meet
in the mausoleum.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.526
That's the second
safest place I know.

10:49.626 --> 10:51.609
What's the safest?

10:51.709 --> 10:53.234
With you.

10:53.334 --> 10:55.417
(<i>sighs</i>)

10:59.709 --> 11:01.442
I thought you'd
be proud of me.

11:01.542 --> 11:04.401
Of what? Being suicidal?

11:04.501 --> 11:05.899
I'm coming back.

11:05.999 --> 11:06.942
I always have.

11:07.042 --> 11:07.899
Yeah. How can you be so sure

11:07.999 --> 11:09.567
that you're going
to come back this time?

11:09.667 --> 11:12.899
Cole, you've been hiding
from them for months.

11:12.999 --> 11:13.899
And I don't understand.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.359
There's a price on your head,

11:15.459 --> 11:16.359
and now, all of a sudden.

11:16.459 --> 11:18.150
you're willing
to expose yourself?

11:18.250 --> 11:19.899
For what?
For good.

11:19.999 --> 11:22.776
You taught me
not to walk away

11:22.876 --> 11:23.899
and let evil win;

11:23.999 --> 11:25.484
to fight the good fight.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.192
That's all I want to do.

11:27.292 --> 11:29.067
They'll kill you.

11:29.167 --> 11:30.651
I have a plan.

11:30.751 --> 11:32.209
Don't worry.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.776
This is the right
thing to do, Phoebe.

11:35.876 --> 11:38.125
You know that. We both do.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.999
Mausoleum. Two hours. Okay?

12:04.626 --> 12:06.709
Vornac.

12:10.709 --> 12:12.999
Well, look who's back.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.609
Kill him?

12:16.709 --> 12:18.626
In a minute.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.999
Belthazor.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.959
Come in. Come in.

12:33.999 --> 12:35.292
(<i>door shuts</i>)

12:40.667 --> 12:42.150
Nice of you

12:42.250 --> 12:43.818
to come home to die.

12:43.918 --> 12:44.899
Actually, I came to help.

12:44.999 --> 12:46.900
I overheard
the prophets talking.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.401
Afraid they'd
spoil your plan.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.067
What makes you think
we have one?

12:50.167 --> 12:51.025
Tarkin,

12:51.125 --> 12:52.942
you always have a plan.

12:53.042 --> 12:55.526
And after everything
you've done,

12:55.626 --> 12:58.317
you think you can
just walk back in,

12:58.417 --> 13:00.025
pick up where
you left off?

13:00.125 --> 13:03.150
I'm here to do what's right,
Vornac...

13:03.250 --> 13:04.899
for the Brotherhood.

13:04.999 --> 13:06.359
Really?

13:06.459 --> 13:09.150
And what can you
possibly offer

13:09.250 --> 13:12.250
that will save
your traitorous head?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.209
The prophet's.

13:34.918 --> 13:36.818
You actually
expect me to believe

13:36.918 --> 13:38.401
you killed the prophet?

13:38.501 --> 13:39.651
He was
a threat to you.

13:39.751 --> 13:41.234
Ah! A bounty
on your head

13:41.334 --> 13:43.442
and yet you
still think of us.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.192
The Brotherhood
comes first.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.234
Words to live or die by.

13:47.334 --> 13:50.359
Trigg was assigned
to kill that prophet.

13:50.459 --> 13:51.192
Did you see him?

13:51.292 --> 13:54.567
No. How is
my old friend?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.292
(<i>fingers snapping</i>)

13:56.792 --> 13:58.942
Your old friend's
missing...

13:59.042 --> 14:00.734
suspiciously.

14:00.834 --> 14:04.067
Brothers missing,
prophets talking...

14:04.167 --> 14:07.692
I had no trouble
tracking you down.

14:07.792 --> 14:08.899
Pretty careless.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.899
What does Raynor
think of this?

14:10.999 --> 14:12.526
Raynor thinks you're a disgrace.

14:12.626 --> 14:14.818
Why? Because I killed the Triad?

14:14.918 --> 14:16.067
Isn't that enough?

14:16.167 --> 14:18.899
They were plotting
to kill the Source

14:18.999 --> 14:19.899
so they could
take over.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.484
Which means they
would have killed

14:21.584 --> 14:23.734
every other demon
in his inner circle,

14:23.834 --> 14:26.667
including Raynor.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.776
We never did trust the Triad.

14:28.876 --> 14:30.109
Then why didn't
he come back

14:30.209 --> 14:32.900
and explain himself? Hmm?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.959
Why run?

14:36.501 --> 14:39.609
Because I had no proof.

14:39.709 --> 14:41.526
That's why.

14:41.626 --> 14:44.292
I knew nobody
would believe me.

14:45.375 --> 14:49.484
Brothers for a hundred years,

14:49.584 --> 14:55.067
and you disappeared
without a word--

14:55.167 --> 14:59.651
left us with
the rumors--

14:59.751 --> 15:01.899
the accusations!

15:01.999 --> 15:06.000
Were you thinking about
the Brotherhood then?

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
Check his story.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.918
Back to work.

15:30.209 --> 15:33.192
So... who're we after?

15:33.292 --> 15:34.401
Not your concern.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.000
Until Klea returns,
he goes nowhere.

15:41.709 --> 15:45.442
He always was a
tight-ass, wasn't he?

15:45.542 --> 15:47.734
Do you blame him?

15:47.834 --> 15:49.692
No.

15:49.792 --> 15:52.526
It's nice to have
you back, Belthazor.

15:52.626 --> 15:54.317
I just hope

15:54.417 --> 15:55.859
it's for good.

15:55.959 --> 15:59.292
Yeah. Me, too.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.899
Poor Phoebe. She
must be going
out of her mind.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.900
It's only
been three hours.
Three-and-a-half.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.275
Way past the time he said
he would check in with her.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.526
Leo, maybe you should

16:08.626 --> 16:09.609
orb to the mausoleum

16:09.709 --> 16:10.899
and she if she's heard from him.

16:10.999 --> 16:13.067
Well, she said that
she would call if she had.

16:13.167 --> 16:14.109
Besides, I think
I should stay here

16:14.209 --> 16:16.317
till we figure out what
the Brotherhood's plan is.

16:16.417 --> 16:19.734
Oh. So now you're voting
with her?

16:19.834 --> 16:21.567
PRUE:
Um,

16:21.667 --> 16:21.994
Luxirom.

16:22.004 --> 16:24.501
That's what the prophet said,
right?

16:25.125 --> 16:26.899
"Merger talks between Luxirom

16:26.999 --> 16:30.818
and MetaSatellite faltered
over the weekend."

16:30.918 --> 16:31.734
Wait a minute.

16:31.834 --> 16:35.942
So, Cole is risking his life
to preserve stock portfolios?

16:36.042 --> 16:37.025
No, it's much bigger than that.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.609
According to this,
if the merger goes through,

16:39.709 --> 16:41.899
the world's information flow
will wind up

16:41.999 --> 16:43.150
in the hands of one company.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.567
Well, that sounds evil
all by itself.

16:45.667 --> 16:49.192
Except for one of the CEOs,
Frank Pirelli, is apparently

16:49.292 --> 16:50.150
getting cold feet about it.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.204
PRUE:
Yeah, what do you want to bet

16:51.214 --> 16:53.192
the Brotherhood wants
this merger to go through

16:53.292 --> 16:54.442
so they can take over
the company?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.275
Which means
they're gonna have to somehow

16:56.375 --> 16:57.776
force Pirelli to vote for it.

16:57.876 --> 16:58.899
Yeah, or kill him.

16:58.999 --> 17:03.067
It sure would be nice to be able
to compare notes with Cole.

17:03.167 --> 17:04.317
Well, we could

17:04.416 --> 17:08.917
if someone would orb
to the mausoleum.

17:11.999 --> 17:13.900
Phoebe?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.898
Anything?

17:15.999 --> 17:17.317
I'm sure it's not as easy

17:17.416 --> 17:20.898
to break away from there
as he thought.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.233
He'll show.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.898
It's okay to
be scared.

17:24.999 --> 17:27.733
No, I'm not scared.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.899
Concerned maybe, a little.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.900
We shouldn't have let him go.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.109
We didn't.

17:33.209 --> 17:34.526
He chose to.

17:34.626 --> 17:36.609
I know, and for what?

17:36.709 --> 17:38.651
To prove to me that he's good?

17:38.751 --> 17:42.375
He doesn't have
to prove anything to me.

17:43.999 --> 17:44.776
Cole!

17:44.876 --> 17:45.983
(<i>Phoebe panting</i>)

17:46.083 --> 17:48.109
Are you okay?

17:48.209 --> 17:49.192
Did they buy
your story?

17:49.292 --> 17:50.734
For now, but I got
to get back.

17:50.834 --> 17:51.983
They're suspicious enough
as it is.

17:52.083 --> 17:55.567
Well, then,
maybe you shouldn't go back.

17:55.667 --> 17:56.818
I want to.

17:56.918 --> 17:57.818
To stop them.

17:57.918 --> 17:59.442
Look, I don't have much time.

17:59.542 --> 18:01.609
All I know is,
they're after someone

18:01.709 --> 18:05.067
who's gonna be at Pier
and Pescadaro at 8:00 a.m.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.442
But I don't know who.

18:06.542 --> 18:07.484
We might.

18:07.584 --> 18:09.359
Frank Pirelli runs

18:09.459 --> 18:10.192
Luxirom.

18:10.292 --> 18:13.776
But he doesn't want a big merger
to happen.

18:13.876 --> 18:16.025
But the Brotherhood does?

18:16.125 --> 18:16.651
Makes sense.

18:16.751 --> 18:19.609
Explains why they've taken over
an investment banking firm.

18:19.709 --> 18:20.899
How does it explain that?

18:20.999 --> 18:22.983
Well, the best way for evil
to get a foothold

18:23.083 --> 18:26.859
in the human world is
to take over their businesses.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.067
Work from the inside out.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.918
Really?

18:31.501 --> 18:34.526
You just learned that, did you?

18:34.626 --> 18:37.334
No.

18:38.876 --> 18:39.442
LEO:
So,

18:39.542 --> 18:42.899
we need to safeguard Pirelli
till the merger vote

18:42.999 --> 18:44.899
at 11:00,

18:44.999 --> 18:46.484
and the Brotherhood loses.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.275
Yes.

18:47.375 --> 18:49.109
But if you intervene,
they might think

18:49.209 --> 18:50.776
I had something to do with it.

18:50.876 --> 18:51.734
You could blow my cover.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.899
We can't let them kill Pirelli.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.484
But you can let them kill me?

18:55.584 --> 18:56.359
No!

18:56.459 --> 18:57.401
No, Cole,

18:57.501 --> 18:57.942
look at me.

18:58.042 --> 18:59.359
We're gonna
find a way

18:59.459 --> 19:01.167
to protect you.

19:02.334 --> 19:04.999
You'd better get back.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.442
All right.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.734
I'm looking forward
to seeing you

19:13.834 --> 19:15.692
in your cap and gown.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.000
Hmm.

19:19.542 --> 19:21.542
Mind if I borrow this?

19:29.167 --> 19:30.942
VORNAC:
Where did you go?

19:31.042 --> 19:31.899
I got thirsty.

19:31.999 --> 19:34.792
Want a urine sample
to prove it?

19:36.584 --> 19:40.900
Your flippant attitude almost
got you killed once before.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.192
Remember that?

19:42.292 --> 19:44.150
I remember.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.401
You saved me.

19:46.501 --> 19:48.709
Hmm.

19:50.999 --> 19:52.067
All right.

19:52.167 --> 19:53.999
Let's review.

19:54.334 --> 19:55.734
We control the perimeter.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.776
Reroute foot traffic.

19:57.876 --> 19:59.234
I'll monitor security.

19:59.334 --> 20:00.734
Once the limo's
been cut off,

20:00.834 --> 20:02.983
Jaxel will throw
the energy ball, and then...

20:03.083 --> 20:04.109
No.

20:04.209 --> 20:05.651
Wait.

20:05.751 --> 20:08.526
Let's give Belthazor the honor.

20:08.626 --> 20:09.899
What better way to make sure

20:09.999 --> 20:13.025
he's truly back
than to have him kill?

20:13.125 --> 20:13.983
Fine.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.818
What's the target?

20:15.918 --> 20:18.417
Why? Does it matter?

20:21.999 --> 20:24.083
It's time.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.401
Nervous?

20:40.501 --> 20:41.983
Hmm?

20:42.083 --> 20:42.899
Me? No.

20:42.999 --> 20:45.042
I was just
thinking.

20:45.542 --> 20:46.899
Been a while since you've seen

20:46.999 --> 20:48.734
this kind of action, hasn't it?

20:48.834 --> 20:51.359
It'll come back to you.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.899
It's in our blood.

20:52.999 --> 20:56.584
Yeah. I know.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.859
Just execute the plan,
Belthazor.

21:00.959 --> 21:02.651
No confusion,
no consequences.

21:02.751 --> 21:05.876
It's no more complicated
than that, okay?

21:15.334 --> 21:16.234
Wouldn't it be nice

21:16.334 --> 21:18.317
to save the world
at a decent hour?

21:18.417 --> 21:19.484
Well, we have to focus here,

21:19.584 --> 21:22.359
because if we don't
pull this off just right,

21:22.459 --> 21:23.025
Cole is screwed.

21:23.125 --> 21:26.150
Well, as long as we wait
until the last second,

21:26.250 --> 21:27.484
Cole should be fine.

21:27.584 --> 21:28.192
Let's just
hope

21:28.292 --> 21:29.567
that killing
Pirelli is
all they want.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.818
Well, if it wasn't,
he would have
told you, right?

21:31.918 --> 21:34.899
I mean, unless you
think he's holding
something back.

21:34.999 --> 21:35.983
You know what?

21:36.083 --> 21:37.150
This is amazing.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.899
First Prue can't sacrifice

21:38.999 --> 21:40.692
Cole fast enough.

21:40.792 --> 21:41.899
And now you can't wait

21:41.999 --> 21:43.651
to sell him out as a traitor.
LEO:
She was just

21:43.751 --> 21:45.983
asking a question, Phoebe.
PHOEBE:
That she should

21:46.083 --> 21:47.651
know the answer to.

21:47.751 --> 21:48.734
We all should.

21:48.834 --> 21:50.567
Cole is risking his life
for this.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.542
The least we can do
is trust him.

22:04.042 --> 22:06.834
Go.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.567
Well?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.900
I haven't been able
to prove Belthazor's story

22:16.000 --> 22:17.734
one way or the other.

22:17.834 --> 22:19.150
That's all right.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.234
We're about to find out

22:20.334 --> 22:23.167
if he's telling the truth
or not.

22:36.209 --> 22:38.501
(<i>tires squealing</i>)

22:38.999 --> 22:40.651
(<i>brakes squealing</i>)

22:40.751 --> 22:43.899
(<i>horn honking</i>)

22:43.999 --> 22:45.275
I got it,

22:45.375 --> 22:46.067
Mr. Pirelli.

22:46.167 --> 22:48.899
What the hell's the matter
with you?!

22:48.999 --> 22:49.983
Move your car now!

22:50.083 --> 22:52.025
What are you waiting for?

22:52.125 --> 22:54.584
Kill...

22:55.250 --> 22:57.792
...or be killed.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.899
MAN:
What, are
you deaf?

23:02.999 --> 23:03.942
Did you hear
what I said?

23:04.042 --> 23:04.899
Move your car!

23:04.999 --> 23:06.818
Now! Hey, where
are you going?

23:06.918 --> 23:07.899
Where are you going,

23:07.999 --> 23:10.667
damn it?! Hey! Hey!

23:12.501 --> 23:13.567
PIPER:
Ooh!

23:13.667 --> 23:15.818
Ooh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:15.918 --> 23:16.651
PRUE:
All right, Leo, go, go!

23:16.751 --> 23:18.999
Go, go!
PIPER:
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.899
Maybe we should
take Cole with us?

23:23.999 --> 23:25.651
No, he has to look
innocent after the fact.

23:25.751 --> 23:28.899
He's got to figure out a
way to get out on his own.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.292
Come on.

23:44.626 --> 23:46.999
Ahh!

23:48.709 --> 23:50.751
(<i>car alarm blaring</i>)

23:54.999 --> 23:57.918
Go get the body.

24:04.167 --> 24:05.567
What do you want
the body for?

24:05.667 --> 24:06.734
There won't be much left.

24:06.834 --> 24:11.292
But even a trace could
alert the humans to the switch.

24:11.999 --> 24:14.983
What switch?

24:15.083 --> 24:17.918
Hmm.

24:21.083 --> 24:22.999
This one.

24:28.999 --> 24:31.918
(<i>brakes squealing</i>)

24:32.584 --> 24:35.250
All clear.

24:36.334 --> 24:38.983
MAN:
Come on, Mr. Pirelli,
get in the car!

24:39.083 --> 24:40.609
PIRELLI:
Get me out of here.

24:40.709 --> 24:41.692
Right away sir.

24:41.792 --> 24:42.899
Good. Go, go, go!

24:42.999 --> 24:45.900
(<i>tires squealing</i>)

24:46.000 --> 24:48.899
Feels great, doesn't it
Belthazor?

24:48.999 --> 24:50.584
Welcome home, brother.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.876
You've been missed.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.900
Where's Pirelli's body?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.734
It wasn't there.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.792
What do you mean
it wasn't there?

25:04.999 --> 25:08.109
(<i>siren wailing</i>)

25:08.209 --> 25:10.567
Pirelli's in the basement.

25:10.667 --> 25:10.995
He's fine.

25:11.005 --> 25:12.899
Phoebe's sleeping potion
worked perfectly.

25:12.999 --> 25:13.899
Me and my potions.

25:13.999 --> 25:14.734
They solve everything.

25:14.834 --> 25:15.899
You didn't have
any problems?

25:15.999 --> 25:19.109
No, Phoebe wanted
to bring home a souvenir,

25:19.209 --> 25:19.746
but otherwise no.

25:19.756 --> 25:22.317
I wonder if the kidnapping
made the morning news.

25:22.417 --> 25:23.067
What do we do now?

25:23.167 --> 25:24.192
Well, I don't know.
That's up to Cole.

25:24.292 --> 25:27.192
He's got to let us know
what the demon's next move...

25:27.292 --> 25:28.526
...is.

25:28.626 --> 25:30.150
It's no coincidence
that just last night,

25:30.250 --> 25:33.025
I changed my mind and decided
to support this merger.

25:33.125 --> 25:35.526
Now someone's
trying to kill me.

25:35.626 --> 25:38.899
That convinces me that
I've made the right choice.

25:38.999 --> 25:40.859
This merger will happen.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.375
Thank you.

25:44.083 --> 25:45.234
What was that
about Cole

25:45.334 --> 25:48.667
telling us everything?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.942
If Cole knew
about the switch,

25:56.042 --> 25:57.776
he would have told us.

25:57.876 --> 25:58.899
Are you sure?

25:58.999 --> 26:00.899
He's back with
his brothers now,

26:00.999 --> 26:01.983
maybe he switched too.

26:02.083 --> 26:02.692
Oh, come on!

26:02.792 --> 26:05.150
Why all of a sudden
are you off his bandwagon?

26:05.250 --> 26:05.899
What changed?

26:05.999 --> 26:08.067
The plan blew up
in our faces,

26:08.167 --> 26:08.899
that's what changed.

26:08.999 --> 26:10.025
And Cole is
responsible for that?

26:10.125 --> 26:12.899
Phoebe, not knowing
about the switch

26:12.999 --> 26:13.776
is a pretty big detail

26:13.876 --> 26:14.942
to miss, don't
you think?

26:15.042 --> 26:15.621
Aside from the whole

26:15.631 --> 26:17.983
"he originally tried to kill us"
thing that's coming to mind

26:18.083 --> 26:18.983
right about now.

26:19.083 --> 26:19.567
Okay, but Piper,

26:19.667 --> 26:21.899
Cole's done a lot
of good since then, okay.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.899
We have to give him
credit for that.

26:23.999 --> 26:24.899
Thank you.

26:24.999 --> 26:27.234
Come on, Phoebe,
you have to admit
you're a little bit

26:27.334 --> 26:28.651
worried about him.

26:28.751 --> 26:29.899
About his getting killed, yes.

26:29.999 --> 26:32.275
But not about his betraying us.

26:32.375 --> 26:32.942
Pirelli is still

26:33.042 --> 26:34.401
out cold in the basement.

26:34.501 --> 26:35.401
How are things up here?

26:35.501 --> 26:36.651
Getting colder by the minute.

26:36.751 --> 26:38.651
PRUE:
Okay, uh, we need

26:38.751 --> 26:40.818
to work on a plan, all right?

26:40.918 --> 26:42.818
we need to be smart
because Cole

26:42.918 --> 26:44.025
is counting on it.

26:44.125 --> 26:45.818
So the merger voting
is at 11:00.

26:45.918 --> 26:47.526
That gives us two hours
to figure out a way

26:47.626 --> 26:48.983
to get the demon impostor
out of there.

26:49.083 --> 26:52.192
Anything we do could
point Cole out as their leak.

26:52.292 --> 26:55.275
So we have to let him
know what we're up to.

26:55.375 --> 26:56.025
Do we?

26:56.125 --> 26:58.899
Yeah. He deserves to know that.

26:58.999 --> 27:00.484
Just let me tell him
to get out of there.

27:00.584 --> 27:02.109
How are you gonna
get him to meet you?

27:02.209 --> 27:05.734
I slipped him a note
at the attack,

27:05.834 --> 27:08.526
asking him to meet me
at the mausoleum.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.442
Let me try.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.150
Okay.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.359
Be careful
and be fast.

27:13.459 --> 27:16.692
And if, for whatever reason,
Cole doesn't meet you there,

27:16.792 --> 27:19.192
get back here right away,
okay, so we can start

27:19.292 --> 27:20.567
working on plan B.

27:20.667 --> 27:22.109
Okay.

27:22.209 --> 27:23.667
Okay, be safe.

27:25.792 --> 27:27.359
PIPER:
Well, since plan A

27:27.459 --> 27:28.609
is going so well,

27:28.709 --> 27:30.192
I'd love to hear
about plan B,

27:30.292 --> 27:31.899
assuming that
you have one.

27:31.999 --> 27:36.125
I've got part of it
in the freezer.

27:36.501 --> 27:38.042
The freezer?

27:38.999 --> 27:41.776
Wait, we're gonna fight
the Brotherhood

27:41.876 --> 27:42.609
with Ben and Jerry's?

27:42.709 --> 27:45.192
No, with a vanquishing
potion made from

27:45.292 --> 27:46.651
Belthazor flesh.

27:46.751 --> 27:48.734
Eww, you kept that this long?

27:48.834 --> 27:49.412
That's disgusting!

27:49.422 --> 27:50.609
LEO:
What makes you think
that it will work?

27:50.709 --> 27:54.401
Well, you said that they were
connected by a blood oath--

27:54.501 --> 27:55.734
their blood--
so the potion

27:55.834 --> 27:59.484
that vanquishes one,
should work on the others.

27:59.584 --> 28:00.150
Hmm.

28:00.250 --> 28:01.692
How lucky that we had

28:01.792 --> 28:03.401
the key ingredient
in our freezer.

28:03.501 --> 28:04.899
Yeah, I guess in the back
of my head,

28:04.999 --> 28:08.417
I sort of thought that we might
need it again someday.

28:20.501 --> 28:21.900
If the real Pirelli
shows up here

28:22.000 --> 28:24.526
and exposes us,
we're dead.

28:24.626 --> 28:25.776
Do you realize that?

28:25.876 --> 28:27.359
Someone must have
removed the body.

28:27.459 --> 28:29.401
That's the only
thing we could figure.

28:29.501 --> 28:32.150
That's impossible.

28:32.250 --> 28:34.417
Not if it was done magically.

28:36.959 --> 28:38.209
Belthazor.

28:38.999 --> 28:41.442
What do you think?

28:41.542 --> 28:46.401
Me? I think uh, well,
I think Klea's right.

28:46.501 --> 28:48.442
Somebody intervened.

28:48.542 --> 28:49.899
VORNAC:
Like who?

28:49.999 --> 28:52.275
How would I know?

28:52.375 --> 28:53.150
Guess.

28:53.250 --> 28:55.317
Witches?

28:55.417 --> 28:56.234
TARKIN:
Witches?

28:56.334 --> 28:58.401
How could witches
be onto us?

28:58.501 --> 28:59.899
Any thoughts?

28:59.999 --> 29:01.942
We might have a leak.

29:02.042 --> 29:05.899
Yes. I think we do.

29:05.999 --> 29:07.983
A traitor amongst us.

29:08.083 --> 29:10.692
Now...

29:10.792 --> 29:13.734
who do you suppose
that could be?

29:13.834 --> 29:14.651
Come on, Vornac,

29:14.751 --> 29:15.899
you can't think
that Belthazor...

29:15.999 --> 29:18.567
Don't tell me
what to think.

29:18.667 --> 29:19.900
Give me a break.
I'm not stupid enough

29:20.000 --> 29:23.109
to come back home
and betray you
all in one day.

29:23.209 --> 29:24.192
That's not stupid.

29:24.292 --> 29:26.359
That's smart.

29:26.459 --> 29:26.942
She's right.

29:27.042 --> 29:31.025
After all, it's so ludicrous,
who would suspect you?

29:31.125 --> 29:32.109
You see,

29:32.209 --> 29:35.150
the thing that bothers me
most about this, Belthazor,

29:35.250 --> 29:36.067
are the rumors.

29:36.167 --> 29:37.899
The ones that say
that while you

29:37.999 --> 29:41.067
were a fugitive,
you fell in love with a witch.

29:41.167 --> 29:42.484
And now here we are,

29:42.584 --> 29:46.818
confronted by the very real
possibility our entire operation

29:46.918 --> 29:48.192
has been compromised by,

29:48.292 --> 29:52.999
coincidence
of coincidences, witches!

29:58.292 --> 30:00.876
The rumors are true.

30:01.999 --> 30:02.776
What?

30:02.876 --> 30:04.150
I loved a witch.

30:04.250 --> 30:05.899
I still do actually.

30:05.999 --> 30:10.109
At least my human half does.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.899
But that was a mistake.

30:11.999 --> 30:13.792
I realize that now.

30:14.667 --> 30:17.417
I'd forgotten who I really was.

30:17.999 --> 30:20.275
Raynor will demand
he die for his treason.

30:20.375 --> 30:25.167
Or he will forgive me for being
able to salvage the operation.

30:25.999 --> 30:29.167
I think I can get Pirelli back.

30:29.999 --> 30:30.692
How?

30:30.792 --> 30:32.275
The witch I was involved with,

30:32.375 --> 30:33.942
her sister has
the power to freeze.

30:34.042 --> 30:35.899
A witch with
that kind of power
could have taken

30:35.999 --> 30:38.484
Pirelli from the limo
without us even knowing it.

30:38.584 --> 30:41.776
Another coincidence.

30:41.876 --> 30:43.275
The witch you bedded

30:43.375 --> 30:46.651
just happens to be the one
who's onto us.

30:46.751 --> 30:50.125
Let me prove my loyalties.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.334
Let me go to the witches
get Pirelli, bring him back.

30:57.709 --> 30:59.999
Then you can pass judgment.

31:01.501 --> 31:06.292
Are you saving us, brother,

31:07.584 --> 31:10.042
or leading us into a trap?

31:12.999 --> 31:15.209
Go.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.983
If he's telling
the truth, help him.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.067
If he's not,

31:22.167 --> 31:25.042
kill him.

31:36.792 --> 31:39.692
Cole! Oh, my God,
I've been so...

31:39.792 --> 31:40.651
No, don't.

31:40.751 --> 31:42.484
It's too dangerous.

31:42.584 --> 31:44.692
What do you mean?

31:44.792 --> 31:45.776
What's the matter?

31:45.876 --> 31:47.067
Just trust me.

31:47.167 --> 31:48.234
Where's Pirelli?

31:48.334 --> 31:49.484
At the manor

31:49.584 --> 31:50.567
in the basement.

31:50.667 --> 31:51.942
So you do have him.

31:52.042 --> 31:53.401
Yeah, of course.

31:53.501 --> 31:54.609
What's your plan?

31:54.709 --> 31:56.359
Our plan is to vanquish

31:56.459 --> 31:57.899
the demon that took his place

31:57.999 --> 31:59.899
before the merger vote.

31:59.999 --> 32:01.359
No, you can't.

32:01.459 --> 32:03.567
That would be a huge mistake.

32:03.667 --> 32:05.125
Why?

32:05.999 --> 32:07.109
Cole, you're scaring me.

32:07.209 --> 32:08.359
You should be scared.

32:08.459 --> 32:10.899
You have no idea
who you're up against.

32:10.999 --> 32:12.334
Oh, don't I?

32:13.209 --> 32:14.899
Cole, what's happening to you?

32:14.999 --> 32:16.734
What aren't
you telling me?

32:16.834 --> 32:19.692
I'm telling you
to stay out of this.

32:19.792 --> 32:20.776
All right?

32:20.876 --> 32:22.899
Don't do anything,
just go back home,

32:22.999 --> 32:25.999
wait to hear from me.

32:27.125 --> 32:29.459
I mean it.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.899
Hey, how did it go?

32:40.999 --> 32:42.150
I'm not sure actually.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.317
What does that mean?

32:43.417 --> 32:44.275
I don't know.

32:44.375 --> 32:45.526
It was strange.

32:45.626 --> 32:46.899
He was strange.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.776
Almost mean.

32:48.876 --> 32:49.899
But he doesn't want us

32:49.999 --> 32:52.899
to go after the demon;
he wants us to wait here.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.859
What? Why?

32:53.959 --> 32:54.401
He didn't say.

32:54.501 --> 32:55.859
It doesn't make sense;

32:55.959 --> 32:57.899
the whole thing
doesn't make sense.

32:57.999 --> 33:00.484
I think he's in trouble.

33:00.584 --> 33:02.067
Either that or...

33:02.167 --> 33:03.275
Or he's turned.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.942
No, I... I don't

33:05.042 --> 33:05.526
believe that.

33:05.626 --> 33:09.417
There's got to be a good reason
Cole's doing what he's doing.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.567
Whoo!Whoa!

33:12.667 --> 33:14.000
(<i>agonized scream</i>)

33:22.417 --> 33:23.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:24.501 --> 33:25.859
How did they know where we live?

33:25.959 --> 33:26.859
How do you think?

33:26.959 --> 33:28.667
PRUE:
Leo!

33:30.125 --> 33:30.899
What is that?

33:30.999 --> 33:32.876
Demon be-gone.

33:34.999 --> 33:38.667
(<i>screaming</i>)

33:39.751 --> 33:41.526
You were right,
the potion worked.

33:41.626 --> 33:42.109
What potion?

33:42.209 --> 33:43.692
PRUE:
Okay, that was
way too easy.

33:43.792 --> 33:46.292
Oh, my God,
Pirelli, Pirelli!

33:53.417 --> 33:54.876
Cole?!

33:59.167 --> 34:02.584
What do you think now?

34:11.417 --> 34:12.484
PRUE:
All right, Phoebe.

34:12.583 --> 34:13.161
We need to get going.

34:13.172 --> 34:15.525
The merger vote's in less
than 30 minutes.

34:15.626 --> 34:16.204
Why didn't you tell me

34:16.214 --> 34:18.899
you kept some
of the potion
to kill Cole with?

34:18.998 --> 34:19.650
Well,

34:19.751 --> 34:20.899
it's a good
thing she did.

34:20.998 --> 34:22.899
It came in pretty handy.

34:22.998 --> 34:24.899
Look, Phoebe, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you,

34:24.998 --> 34:27.899
but the truth is,
until recently,

34:27.998 --> 34:29.359
I didn't really
trust Cole.

34:29.458 --> 34:30.120
I mean, I sort of felt

34:30.130 --> 34:31.899
like I had to protect us
just in case.

34:31.998 --> 34:33.899
Just in case what?
He'd try to kill us?

34:33.998 --> 34:35.650
It wouldn't be the first time.

34:35.751 --> 34:37.650
Well, it wouldn't.

34:37.751 --> 34:38.859
Look, I know you love him.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.525
And we all know
that he loves you.

34:40.626 --> 34:42.900
But sending demons
to kidnap our innocent

34:43.000 --> 34:44.734
kind of speaks for itself.

34:44.833 --> 34:45.899
LEO:
You were right.

34:45.998 --> 34:47.275
We never should
have let him go under.

34:47.375 --> 34:51.942
I still think this is all part
of some plan of his.

34:52.042 --> 34:52.734
It has to be.

34:52.833 --> 34:55.400
Okay, but right now we need
to stick to our plan,

34:55.501 --> 34:58.109
which is to vanquish
the demon impostor.

34:58.209 --> 34:58.776
Cole said not to.

34:58.876 --> 35:01.317
He said it was a huge mistake,
and I believe him.

35:01.417 --> 35:02.899
PIPER:
Okay,

35:02.999 --> 35:04.751
but we don't.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.275
All right,
come on, you guys,

35:06.375 --> 35:07.401
we really have
to get going.

35:07.501 --> 35:08.942
The vote's three
to one, Pheebs.

35:09.042 --> 35:10.667
You coming?

35:11.999 --> 35:14.651
VORNAC:
You cost me three
of my best demons!

35:14.751 --> 35:15.609
What the hell
went wrong?

35:15.709 --> 35:18.317
The witches were more
prepared than we thought.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.899
Another coincidence?

35:19.999 --> 35:21.359
I didn't tip them.

35:21.459 --> 35:22.609
Did he?

35:22.709 --> 35:23.899
He told the witch to go home.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.442
Unless it was

35:25.542 --> 35:27.334
some sort of code.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.317
It wasn't.

35:29.417 --> 35:30.734
Look, the plan was

35:30.834 --> 35:32.234
to get Pirelli-- I did that.

35:32.334 --> 35:33.317
Then where is he?

35:33.417 --> 35:35.192
Somewhere you
can't get him.

35:35.292 --> 35:37.899
Not until I'm sure
you won't kill me.

35:37.999 --> 35:40.609
And how do I know
you really have him?

35:40.709 --> 35:41.983
TARKIN:
I was there.

35:42.083 --> 35:43.751
He has him.

35:44.584 --> 35:46.999
And do I trust you anymore?

35:52.626 --> 35:53.359
It's time.

35:53.459 --> 35:55.542
I have to get back.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.899
But after the vote,
you'd better deliver Pirelli.

36:01.999 --> 36:04.542
Or I will kill you.

36:06.417 --> 36:08.317
No, don't.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.025
VORNAC:
Don't what?

36:10.125 --> 36:12.275
Don't go.

36:12.375 --> 36:14.567
I know these
witches, Vornac.

36:14.667 --> 36:15.692
Now that I've
kidnapped Pirelli,

36:15.792 --> 36:17.526
they'll do anything
they can to stop us.

36:17.626 --> 36:19.025
They'll try
to vanquish you.

36:19.125 --> 36:22.125
And they have the potion
to do it, too.

36:24.876 --> 36:27.999
But will they vanquish you?

36:34.999 --> 36:37.584
The vote's in, demon guy.
You lose.

36:37.999 --> 36:39.651
PHOEBE:
Piper, wait.

36:39.751 --> 36:41.484
Cole?

36:41.584 --> 36:42.899
Surprised?

36:42.999 --> 36:45.501
What are you
doing here?

36:46.375 --> 36:47.359
Where is the demon?

36:47.459 --> 36:48.859
He sent me instead.

36:48.959 --> 36:50.275
Might be a test.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.899
I think he's onto us.

36:51.999 --> 36:52.899
Onto <i>us?</i>

36:52.999 --> 36:55.442
You make it sound
like we're working together.

36:55.542 --> 36:56.734
Aren't we?

36:56.834 --> 36:57.734
PIPER:
Hmm.

36:57.834 --> 36:58.204
Who are you kidding?

36:58.214 --> 37:00.899
We should vanquish you
on the spot. Where's Pirelli?

37:00.999 --> 37:02.609
He's safe.

37:02.709 --> 37:03.818
PRUE:
Cole,

37:03.918 --> 37:05.275
where is he?

37:05.375 --> 37:07.526
Where else would he be?

37:07.626 --> 37:10.626
The safest place you know.

37:11.834 --> 37:13.150
The mausoleum.

37:13.250 --> 37:14.942
Isn't that what we agreed to?

37:15.042 --> 37:17.834
No, unfortunately, it isn't.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.209
PRUE:
Phoebe!

37:21.876 --> 37:26.876
(<i>screaming and moaning</i>)

37:27.542 --> 37:30.125
(<i>shrieking</i>)

37:32.167 --> 37:34.526
But? how did
you know?

37:34.626 --> 37:35.067
Did you know?

37:35.167 --> 37:39.109
The safest place
that Cole knows is with me.

37:39.209 --> 37:40.999
He said so.

37:43.999 --> 37:44.859
Whoa!

37:44.959 --> 37:45.859
Easy. Easy.

37:45.959 --> 37:46.899
I know I'm not
very popular

37:46.999 --> 37:50.899
right now, but let the condemned
man have his last words.

37:50.999 --> 37:52.899
I had no choice but

37:52.999 --> 37:54.067
to play it this way.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.484
They were so suspicious of me,

37:55.584 --> 37:58.734
I had to make everyone,
especially you, believe

37:58.834 --> 37:59.942
I was evil.

38:00.042 --> 38:00.983
Or I was dead.

38:01.083 --> 38:03.818
Some of us still
think you're evil.

38:03.918 --> 38:04.818
PRUE:
All right,

38:04.918 --> 38:06.899
so why did that demon
impersonate you?

38:06.999 --> 38:08.526
He didn't trust me.

38:08.626 --> 38:09.567
Wanted to find out

38:09.667 --> 38:11.751
whose side I was really on.

38:12.417 --> 38:14.667
I knew you wouldn't
fall for it.

38:15.959 --> 38:16.899
What about Pirelli?

38:16.999 --> 38:17.899
I had to make you think

38:17.999 --> 38:19.900
I'd actually betrayed you.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.501
To give you motivation
to kill Vornac and me.

38:28.542 --> 38:30.442
Forgive me.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.192
I never doubted you!

38:33.292 --> 38:35.375
Well, maybe just a little.

38:41.834 --> 38:44.109
COLE:
You'd better get Leo
to the mausoleum.

38:44.209 --> 38:45.899
Get Pirelli back here.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.234
Before the merger.

38:47.334 --> 38:48.692
Can't you get Pirelli?

38:48.792 --> 38:49.567
COLE:
No.

38:49.667 --> 38:52.459
I have to... get back.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.834
You can't go back now.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.375
Just to cover my tracks.

38:58.709 --> 39:00.999
I don't want those guys
hunting me down.

39:06.501 --> 39:09.999
I'll be out before
your graduation party
tonight, I promise.

39:16.959 --> 39:18.899
TARKIN:
You saw the witches
kill Vornac?

39:18.999 --> 39:20.899
No. I saw what was left.

39:20.999 --> 39:23.442
So I went to kill Pirelli,
but he was gone.

39:23.542 --> 39:26.359
I can only assume
the witches found him.

39:26.459 --> 39:27.442
This is a disaster.

39:27.542 --> 39:28.609
What are we gonna tell Raynor?

39:28.709 --> 39:32.359
He wants a full accounting,
you know.

39:32.459 --> 39:35.359
Tell him I warned Vornac
not to go.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.359
But he didn't listen.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.192
Hmm?

39:38.292 --> 39:39.942
And now I have to go.

39:40.042 --> 39:42.667
Go? Where?

39:43.292 --> 39:44.983
I still have to find proof
for the Source

39:45.083 --> 39:45.942
to clear my name.

39:46.042 --> 39:49.209
I can't very well
do that here, can I?

39:49.918 --> 39:52.167
See you soon,
my brother.

39:52.959 --> 39:54.109
You can't go.

39:54.209 --> 39:55.067
Raynor wants

39:55.167 --> 39:58.025
a full accounting from you.

39:58.125 --> 40:00.192
You can fill him in.

40:00.292 --> 40:02.067
You know
just as much

40:02.167 --> 40:04.209
as I do.

40:15.042 --> 40:18.999
TARKIN:
You were
right, Raynor.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.899
Belthazor has
much to explain...

40:23.999 --> 40:27.000
and much to answer for.

40:34.751 --> 40:37.292
(<i>lively party chatter</i>)

40:45.542 --> 40:47.192
Why can't we ever
throw a party

40:47.292 --> 40:49.899
or have a wedding,
or just live our lives

40:49.999 --> 40:52.192
without evil
screwing it up?

40:52.292 --> 40:55.651
She'll start celebrating
as soon as Cole shows up.

40:55.751 --> 40:57.983
What if he doesn't?

40:58.083 --> 41:00.834
What if he can't?

41:03.999 --> 41:05.334
Hey?

41:05.876 --> 41:07.234
Look, whatever happens,

41:07.334 --> 41:08.776
he did the right thing.

41:08.876 --> 41:10.651
I mean, he helped us get
Pirelli back

41:10.751 --> 41:12.025
in time to cancel
the merger.

41:12.125 --> 41:14.192
He helped us stop
the Brotherhood.

41:14.292 --> 41:16.359
He proved he was good.

41:16.459 --> 41:17.567
Yeah, but at what cost?

41:17.667 --> 41:20.109
You can't really think
of it like that.

41:20.209 --> 41:21.484
Why not?

41:21.584 --> 41:23.818
Shouldn't I get to protect
one part of my life

41:23.918 --> 41:27.900
and say, "This, magic
doesn't screw with."

41:28.000 --> 41:29.899
"This, I get to keep."?

41:29.999 --> 41:32.334
Yes, you should.

41:32.918 --> 41:34.526
PHOEBE:
Last night Cole was back

41:34.626 --> 41:36.899
and he wanted to strip
his powers

41:36.999 --> 41:40.109
and I was graduating.

41:40.209 --> 41:44.192
Yesterday everything
was perfect.

41:44.292 --> 41:45.818
And today?

41:45.918 --> 41:47.792
It's all fallen apart.

41:49.375 --> 41:51.334
Where is he?

41:52.209 --> 41:54.209
What happened to him?
