Quarren and their peaceful

22:54.202 --> 22:55.368
Yeah, but it may take them

22:55.370 --> 22:56.469

22:56.471 --> 22:57.236
We're gonna have to get

23:40.949 --> 23:43.416

to find out.

24:30.398 --> 24:31.864

25:54.983 --> 25:57.083

25:57.085 --> 25:58.384

problems.

All around me.

27:36.818 --> 27:38.584
This is our only chance.

27:38.586 --> 27:39.885
We need to split up and hide

27:39.887 --> 27:41.320
the prince's whereabouts.

27:41.322 --> 27:42.722
I'm not sure that's

27:42.724 --> 27:43.656
the best strategy.

27:43.658 --> 27:44.957
<i> I'm sure.</i>

27:44.959 --> 27:46.325
Captain Ackbar's words

28:58.302 --> 29:00.669
longtime ally, trapped on an

29:00.671 --> 29:02.604
occupied planet, she is.

29:02.606 --> 29:04.239
Hmm...

29:04.241 --> 29:06.008
Wesa need some thinking time

29:06.010 --> 29:08.043
to respond to deesa news.

29:08.045 --> 29:09.077
Thinking?

29:09.079 --> 29:10.245
Nosa thinking!

29:10.247 --> 29:11.947
Mesa thinking padme would help

29:11.949 --> 29:14.883
us--has helped us, big-time!

29:14.885 --> 29:16.985
Wesa gots to help her now!

29:16.987 --> 29:18.120
Yousa right.

29:18.122 --> 29:19.788
Thinking time's-a done!

29:19.790 --> 29:22.057
Wesa need to be leaving now.

29:37.421 --> 29:39.421
I don't think we've been followed.

29:39.510 --> 29:42.978
Commander Monnk, post a lookout.

29:42.980 --> 29:44.379
We have no army, and we don't

29:44.381 --> 29:45.214
know if reinforcements

29:45.216 --> 29:46.215
are coming.

29:46.217 --> 29:47.883
What are our options?

29:47.885 --> 29:49.351
We sit tight.

29:49.353 --> 29:51.386
There's not much we can do.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.602
Sir, you'd better come
see this.

30:18.256 --> 30:21.256
So many prisoners.
Where are they taking them?

30:21.285 --> 30:22.851
To become slaves.

30:22.853 --> 30:24.286
I can't believe Nossor Ri

30:24.288 --> 30:25.954
and the Quarren agreed to this.

30:25.956 --> 30:27.289
Count Dooku rules here

30:27.291 --> 30:29.658
for now, not the Quarren.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.226
What you see, prince,

30:31.228 --> 30:32.527
is the future of all the people

30:32.529 --> 30:33.829
on this world,

30:33.831 --> 30:35.831
<i>Mon Cala and Quarren...</i>

30:35.833 --> 30:37.966
All slaves for Count Dooku.

30:55.277 --> 30:58.277
Captain *** which of
these structures houses the

30:58.289 --> 30:59.888
city's interplanetary scanners?

30:59.890 --> 31:01.356
It's over there,

31:01.358 --> 31:02.758
across the square.

31:02.760 --> 31:03.825
Why?

31:03.827 --> 31:05.227
Well, just in case Master

31:05.229 --> 31:06.995
Yoda is sending reinforcements,

31:06.997 --> 31:08.196
I thought it'd be helpful if

31:08.198 --> 31:08.997
the enemy couldn't tell

31:08.999 --> 31:10.098
they were coming.

31:10.100 --> 31:11.099
If we knock out those

31:11.101 --> 31:12.434
sensors, they won't see our

31:12.436 --> 31:13.435
reinforcements until they're

31:13.437 --> 31:15.170
right on top of the city.

31:15.172 --> 31:17.406
Assuming someone is coming.

31:17.408 --> 31:18.607
I am sure Master Yoda will

31:18.609 --> 31:20.609
find a way to send help.

31:20.611 --> 31:22.711
Anakin, it's your move.

31:22.713 --> 31:24.680
Follow me.

31:37.230 --> 31:39.230
There's must be something more I can do.

31:39.430 --> 31:40.796
I know it's hard,

31:40.798 --> 31:42.864
but you have to be patient.

31:42.866 --> 31:45.233
But you saw my people.

31:45.235 --> 31:46.735
I've failed them.

31:46.737 --> 31:47.703
No.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.938
Remember captain Ackbar's words:

31:49.940 --> 31:52.341
You are the hope of your people.

31:52.343 --> 31:53.475
As long as you live,

31:53.477 --> 31:55.010
they will endure.

31:55.012 --> 31:56.678
I need an army.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.347
We have to fight back.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.815
You don't have to carry

31:59.817 --> 32:01.750
a sword to be powerful.

32:01.752 --> 32:03.318
Some leaders' strength is

32:03.320 --> 32:05.787
inspiring greatness in others.

32:05.789 --> 32:06.922
But my people don't even know

32:06.924 --> 32:07.756
I'm alive.

32:07.758 --> 32:08.857
How can I inspire them

32:08.859 --> 32:10.892
how can I inspire them
if they think I'm dead?

32:22.651 --> 32:26.247
Okay, just cover me.
I'm gonna have to concentrate.

32:26.276 --> 32:27.376
Concentrate?

32:27.378 --> 32:28.777
Concentrate on what?

32:28.779 --> 32:30.979
Bringing that building down.

32:39.851 --> 32:44.686
Anakin, hurry!

33:15.592 --> 33:17.192
What's happening?
Report!

33:17.194 --> 33:18.660
We've lost all radar

33:18.662 --> 33:20.695
and sonar scanning, sir.

33:20.697 --> 33:22.731
Reestablish the connections.

33:22.733 --> 33:24.099
We cannot, sir.

33:24.101 --> 33:25.467
Why not?

33:25.469 --> 33:26.668
The building that housed

33:26.670 --> 33:29.438
the radar is gone.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.474
We're blind.

33:32.476 --> 33:33.842
Prepare for an attack!

33:33.844 --> 33:35.177
But there was nothing on the

33:35.179 --> 33:37.279
scope prior to the attack.

33:37.281 --> 33:38.680
That is precisely why we must

33:38.682 --> 33:40.949
assume an attack is imminent!

33:40.951 --> 33:44.086
Guards, to me!

33:44.088 --> 33:46.188
Where are you going?

33:46.190 --> 33:48.056
To find that meddling prince

33:48.058 --> 33:50.692
and his jedi friends.

34:14.005 --> 34:16.661
At least we're taking
attention away from the prince.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.737
Coda, the prince.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.739
Hurry!

34:41.045 --> 34:42.982
The prince is alive!

34:43.040 --> 34:44.275
Look there!

34:44.281 --> 34:46.114
People of Mon Cala,

34:46.116 --> 34:48.416
all people of Mon Cala who would

34:48.418 --> 34:51.219
not be slaves, have hope!

34:51.221 --> 34:52.420
We will fight for you,

34:52.422 --> 34:53.388
prince!

34:53.389 --> 34:54.956
You will not be prisoners

34:54.958 --> 34:56.091
much longer.

34:56.092 --> 34:57.492
Okay, I think the show

34:57.494 --> 34:58.226
is over.

34:58.228 --> 34:59.227
The guards will be coming.

34:59.229 --> 35:01.229
We have to go.

35:20.639 --> 35:21.861
Wesa ready.

35:47.036 --> 35:49.636
Gungans.
The tide has turned

35:49.646 --> 35:50.779
in our favor.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.547
Let's free my people.

35:52.549 --> 35:54.716
Attack!

36:27.532 --> 36:30.532
Ani. Mesa so happy to see you.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.439
Perfect timing, Jar-Jar.

36:32.441 --> 36:33.473
Whassa?

36:33.475 --> 36:35.408
Mesa can't hear so good

36:35.410 --> 36:37.911
since we submergify!

37:14.563 --> 37:17.163
Tamson... Tamson, come in.

37:17.185 --> 37:18.718
Where are you?

37:18.720 --> 37:20.186
The Republic reinforcements are

37:20.188 --> 37:21.788
overwhelming our defenses.

37:21.790 --> 37:23.356
We must retreat.

37:23.358 --> 37:25.358
We must retreat now!

37:25.360 --> 37:26.459
I warned you this attack

37:26.461 --> 37:27.227
was coming.

37:27.229 --> 37:28.261
Where are the jedi

37:28.263 --> 37:29.896
concentrating their attack?

37:29.898 --> 37:32.198
There are two groups of jedi,

37:32.200 --> 37:34.234
one in the lower city center

37:34.236 --> 37:35.702
and two releasing the prisoners

37:35.704 --> 37:37.737
near the coral base.

37:37.739 --> 37:39.272
The prisoners?

37:39.274 --> 37:40.774
The prince must be with them.

37:40.776 --> 37:41.808
I'm committing the

37:41.810 --> 37:43.543
reinforcements that Count Dooku

37:43.545 --> 37:44.811
sent to the attack.

37:44.813 --> 37:47.514
He will not escape this time.

37:52.747 --> 37:57.657
Churn them up!

38:27.457 --> 38:30.657
Stay in the center.
There's less turbulence.

39:43.344 --> 39:45.344
Anakin!

39:49.128 --> 39:52.614
Skywalker!
We've got one chance!

40:18.514 --> 40:20.332
Asoka stay with the prince.

40:20.353 --> 40:22.486
I'll hold him off.

40:33.968 --> 40:37.968
Sever one of the legs!

41:40.907 --> 41:43.907
Find the prince!
Find him!

41:48.908 --> 41:51.508
Are you and I are the only ones left.

41:52.012 --> 41:53.878
I'm sorry, Lee-Char.

41:54.368 --> 41:56.035
I know what I must do.

41:56.037 --> 41:58.437
I know my people need me.

41:58.439 --> 41:59.972
I just don't know how to win

41:59.974 --> 42:00.940
this war.

42:00.942 --> 42:03.509
Look, I know you're scared,

42:03.511 --> 42:05.144
but you can't let your fear

42:05.146 --> 42:06.278
control you.

42:06.280 --> 42:07.846
Aren't you scared?

42:07.848 --> 42:10.316
I used to be, all the time,

42:10.318 --> 42:12.318
until I realized that if you

42:12.320 --> 42:13.752
make decisions out of fear,

42:13.754 --> 42:16.121
you're more likely to be wrong.

42:16.123 --> 42:18.457
I will unify Mon Cala again.

42:18.459 --> 42:19.992
I promise.

42:20.895 --> 42:22.861
We have to go.
