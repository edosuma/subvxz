WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.130
I've heard from the police
that there are photos of Linda.

00:02.180 --> 00:03.850
Nude photos.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.689
It's the police lying again, innit?

00:05.740 --> 00:09.170
How'd you get into the school?
Caretaker gave me the key. Kevin Russell.

00:09.220 --> 00:09.822
I paid him.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.290
Paid him what?
Ten quid.

00:11.340 --> 00:14.930
And I sent him Linda's photos.
No, no, no.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.850
I'm applying for an exhumation order.
What, for Linda?

00:17.900 --> 00:21.210
I actually think it's wrong.
And shame on you for even thinking it.

00:21.260 --> 00:24.170
I'm leaking these.
Emma, this isn't right.

00:24.220 --> 00:29.010
She's been a person of interest
for MI5 and 6 for years.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.530
Who were you meeting outside
earlier this evening?

00:31.580 --> 00:33.210
My cousin.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.730
In addition to leaking nude photos
of a murdered teenager to the press,

00:38.780 --> 00:42.490
she allows a terrorist recruiting
network to be run out of her home.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.540
Armed police!

00:45.860 --> 00:48.220
Remember you are my lawyer.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.130
It's about that Tony Pullings.

00:53.180 --> 00:54.890
He photographed me.

00:54.940 --> 00:57.130
Did you know Linda Simms?
Did you know about her?

00:57.180 --> 00:58.500
Yeah.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.740
<i>Way down in the water</i>

01:07.500 --> 01:10.260
<i>Way down in the hole</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:14.330
<i>Far away from any soul</i>

01:14.380 --> 01:17.970
Where there is discord,
may we bring harmony

01:18.020 --> 01:20.130
and where there is despair,
may we bring hope.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.820
<i>I'm coming back from the fire</i>

01:25.420 --> 01:27.330
Put your trust in us.

01:27.380 --> 01:28.970
<i>Crawling back from the flames</i>

01:29.020 --> 01:31.420
We shall repay that trust for you.

01:34.220 --> 01:37.370
<i>Coming back from the fire,
not burning down</i>

01:37.420 --> 01:39.570
Turn it! Spin it!

01:39.620 --> 01:40.940
Spin the camera.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.300
Spin the camera!

01:48.900 --> 01:51.850
'Late last night,
the East End home of Emma Banville,

01:51.900 --> 01:54.330
lawyer for the recently
released Kevin Russell,

01:54.380 --> 01:56.290
was raided by armed police

01:56.340 --> 01:59.090
in connection with possible
terrorist activities.

01:59.140 --> 02:00.930
A number of suspects were arrested

02:00.980 --> 02:02.730
including Russell himself.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.610
In yet more trouble for Banville,

02:04.660 --> 02:05.770
it is now being alleged

02:05.820 --> 02:07.890
that she may have leaked photographs

02:07.940 --> 02:10.020
of murdered schoolgirl Linda Simms.

02:17.940 --> 02:20.220
Can I have a moment with him, please?
Thank you.

02:22.580 --> 02:24.090
I'm really sorry.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.730
I hoped I'd get you out on bail.
I know.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.890
It's OK.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.420
No, it's not OK.

02:30.340 --> 02:32.180
It's deeply unfair.

02:34.140 --> 02:38.380
Steve and me, we were playing
poker last night... for biscuits.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.220
He says you're trying to adopt a kid.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.580
Erm... yeah.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.290
Yeah, well,
with all the fuss in the house...

02:48.340 --> 02:49.610
Did I mess it up for you?

02:49.660 --> 02:52.210
No. It wasn't you.
It was just... bad luck.

02:52.260 --> 02:54.610
Frankly, it's a daft idea, anyway.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.020
It's not daft.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.900
Having a kid keeps you going.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.020
Jason keeps me going.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.850
OK, so now he hates my guts but...

03:03.900 --> 03:06.850
No, but he won't always.
Jason will learn the truth.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.010
There's a girl come forward,
said she was photographed by Pullings.

03:10.060 --> 03:11.770
She'll prove Pullings is lying.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.500
I'm going to get you out, Kevin.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.060
I know you will.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.300
Time to go.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.860 --> 03:29.730
Ms Banville?

03:29.780 --> 03:32.180
What do you want?
This way, if you would.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.970
Congratulations.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.890
You managed to get Kevin
Russell back inside.

03:46.940 --> 03:48.810
I want to talk about Miriam Attar.

03:48.860 --> 03:52.210
Where is she?
Sizemore. Mothers and Infants.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.260
This was taken from Mrs Attar.

03:55.380 --> 03:58.490
It's the phone that she used
to call her contacts in Syria.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.530
The SIM card's missing.

04:00.580 --> 04:02.690
How do you know she
was contacting Syria?

04:02.740 --> 04:06.530
GCHQ has a dragnet over calls
in and out of ISIS-held areas.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.930
Only the NSA have that capacity.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.730
Is SO15 in bed with NSA now?

04:10.780 --> 04:13.130
Where's the SIM card?
No idea.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.984
One of my officers saw
Miriam Attar hug you.

04:16.084 --> 04:17.529
She was terrified.

04:17.579 --> 04:22.130
Armed men had just smashed their way into
my house and torn her baby from her arms.

04:22.180 --> 04:24.730
Did she give you the SIM card?
Let's be honest.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.610
You're here because of Kevin Russell.

04:26.660 --> 04:29.170
Because I proved your
investigation was a load of crap.

04:29.220 --> 04:32.050
So you're fabricating charges
against an innocent woman.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.970
Miriam's husband works for ISIS.

04:34.020 --> 04:36.490
You're wrong.
Miriam helps him.

04:36.540 --> 04:40.610
Now, I thought you were aiding them
unwittingly but now I see it's deliberate.

04:40.660 --> 04:43.260
I thought you played by
the rules but you don't.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.370
You'd do anything.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.850
Yes.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.980
I will defend my client as I
am obliged to under the law.

04:51.860 --> 04:53.580
What will you do to cover your back?

04:55.700 --> 04:58.490
Why is Tony Pullings
crawling out of the woodwork?

04:58.540 --> 05:02.180
Where are you hiding him?
I know nothing about Pullings.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.460
So get out...

05:08.980 --> 05:10.980
.. before I really lose my temper.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.140
Hello, Tony.

05:40.660 --> 05:42.660
How long is this going on for?

05:43.740 --> 05:45.850
Until the retrial.
That's months.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.010
Weeks.

05:47.060 --> 05:51.490
Until then, we have to keep you away from
Banville and your colleagues in the press.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.170
Testify about Linda and
Russell and you're done.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.540
You won't come across as very admirable
but at least you had the guts to own up.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.820
What about the other girls?

06:03.620 --> 06:04.730
Irrelevant.

06:04.780 --> 06:08.100
Unless you raped or killed one of them.
You didn't, did you?

06:08.860 --> 06:10.860
No.
That is a relief.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.650
Do what I say.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.200
Russell will be back where he belongs
and you can get on with your life.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.460
OK?

06:24.460 --> 06:26.460
I know who you're protecting.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.460
Yeah, I'm protecting you, Tony.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.450
I have all your negatives, remember?

06:35.500 --> 06:40.130
So if you don't want to go away for
a very long time, do what I say.

06:40.180 --> 06:43.340
Send the murderer back to jail.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.700
He said it was his best shot ever.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.370
Where did you meet him?

07:03.420 --> 07:05.300
He stopped me in the street.

07:06.140 --> 07:08.140
Asked me if I wanted to be famous.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.780
So he took photos of you?

07:13.700 --> 07:14.820
Nude?

07:16.060 --> 07:19.220
Didn't start nude.
Just... ended up there.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.620
Then he said that he'd
work harder for me...

07:25.740 --> 07:27.740
.. if I worked harder for him.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.250
You slept with him?

07:33.300 --> 07:35.090
I was wild then.

07:35.140 --> 07:36.530
Stupid.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.450
You were 15.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.090
It was a crime.

07:40.140 --> 07:41.530
Yeah.

07:41.580 --> 07:43.220
And how do I prove it now?

07:44.860 --> 07:46.330
What did he do with the photos?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.380
God knows.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.220
I've got two little boys now.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.300
I know what the internet's like.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.580
Siobhan, you said you knew Linda Simms.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.420
About her.

08:10.420 --> 08:12.210
Pullings mentioned her.

08:12.260 --> 08:14.540
Why?
Because of the parties.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.370
What parties? Where?

08:18.420 --> 08:20.970
He said I'd meet rich guys...

08:21.020 --> 08:22.940
earn lots of money...

08:23.940 --> 08:26.140
.. if I'd do with them
what I did with him.

08:27.060 --> 08:28.930
Did you?

08:28.980 --> 08:30.740
I said I was stupid.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.260
I wasn't a tart.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.970
You said Linda knew about the parties.

08:36.020 --> 08:37.370
Had she been to them?

08:37.419 --> 08:39.419
He said she had.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.340
Said she was set for life.

08:43.059 --> 08:45.890
You can't let them dig her up, Matt!
You just can't!

08:45.940 --> 08:49.690
Luke, you're his advisor. Advise him.
I'm so disappointed.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.940
Charlie,
I'm deeply sorry for what's happened.

08:55.220 --> 08:57.050
This is on you, Matt.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.180
We'll find a way to fix this, Charlie.

09:00.840 --> 09:01.920
What was that about?

09:03.940 --> 09:06.330
Luke? Why are they so upset?

09:07.940 --> 09:11.610
Not only have Charlie and Beth had to see
Linda splashed naked all over the press,

09:11.660 --> 09:13.760
they've now been invited
by the Chief Coroner

09:13.860 --> 09:16.060
to a hearing about
her possible exhumation.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.420
That's awful.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.770
Who's doing this?

09:21.820 --> 09:25.700
Emma Banville. Her new tactic...
try and turn Linda into a whore.

09:26.940 --> 09:28.020
Matt?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.860
What are you doing about this?

09:32.380 --> 09:34.090
What can I do?

09:34.140 --> 09:35.540
Seriously?

09:36.260 --> 09:38.090
That bird has flown.

09:38.140 --> 09:39.930
And it will backfire on Banville.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.850
As for the Coroner, ordinary
decent common sense will prevail.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.770
My involvement...
You do realise what else is going on here?

09:45.820 --> 09:49.410
A leadership contest which you'll only
win if you pull the union and youth vote

09:49.460 --> 09:51.610
from that Trotskyite
dickhead you're against.

09:51.660 --> 09:55.090
And who did you let walk out that door,
disappointed and angry?

09:55.140 --> 09:57.650
An ex-shop steward with
serious heft in the movement.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.650
You think he's going to support you now?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.650
Go with him to the Chief
Coroner's hearing.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.250
At the very least, you need to
write a letter on his behalf.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.620
You can't let Banville
get away with this.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.810
How can we use this?

10:10.860 --> 10:13.490
Unless we find Pullings,
there's nothing we can prove.

10:13.540 --> 10:15.730
We take it to the police.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.180
They lead us to Pullings.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.930
Emma.
Hi, Delilah.

10:23.980 --> 10:26.330
I tried you earlier. No answer.

10:26.380 --> 10:27.770
Has something happened?

10:27.820 --> 10:30.570
Well, yes. Don't you think?

10:30.620 --> 10:32.570
Do you mean last night at my house?

10:32.620 --> 10:35.410
We couldn't place a child
in that sort of environment.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.890
It's crazy. You should have told us.

10:37.940 --> 10:40.610
Those people are actually
living in your house.

10:40.660 --> 10:44.460
Yeah, but it was temporary.
They... They would have been gone.

10:45.260 --> 10:49.660
Obviously the local authority have withdrawn
their approval of you as foster parents.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.220
We've found another
family to take the boy.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.530
Good.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.660
I'm glad. Erm...

11:01.500 --> 11:03.090
What about the future?

11:03.140 --> 11:06.250
While you're doing the sort
of legal work you do now, no.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.730
And what... What if I stopped
doing that sort of work?

11:08.780 --> 11:11.410
What if I... do something else,
like conveyancing or...

11:11.460 --> 11:14.450
We'd need proof that you're committed
to it. At least a year or two.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.820
And that would mean, I'm afraid,
that your age became an issue.

11:19.020 --> 11:21.020
A big issue.

11:21.860 --> 11:23.460
OK.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.850
Erm... thank you for telling me.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.980
I'm sorry.

11:31.380 --> 11:33.500
So am I. Bye.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.620
Do you want to go home?

11:55.460 --> 11:56.780
No.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.450
No.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.460
I want to go to work.

12:06.140 --> 12:10.330
You know this is hearsay, don't you?
"He said, she said" 13 years ago.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.290
None of it will stand up in court.

12:12.340 --> 12:15.240
I think I might know better
than you what stands up in court.

12:15.940 --> 12:19.570
Will you let me interview this girl?
Will you let me interview Tony Pullings?

12:19.620 --> 12:21.170
It's up to him but he'll say no.

12:21.220 --> 12:23.330
It's all getting muddier, isn't it?

12:23.380 --> 12:26.010
We now have not only one
alternative suspect, Pullings,

12:26.060 --> 12:29.690
but a whole party of them... men who
knew Linda, maybe slept with her.

12:29.740 --> 12:33.210
What do you think it is? Some creepy
sex ring with Tony Pullings as the pimp?

12:33.260 --> 12:36.370
All these holes in
Greenwood's investigation.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.050
I don't envy you trying to fill them.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.100
And all this will come out in court.

13:35.060 --> 13:37.060
Sorry I took so long.
Emma.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.370
Be careful what you say.
They're probably listening.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.420
No touching.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.770
How long do we have to stay here?

13:47.820 --> 13:51.050
Under the Terrorism Act, they can
hold you up to 14 days without charge.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.250
Terrorism? What terrorism did I do?

13:54.300 --> 13:57.570
They said you made a call to
an ISIS-held area in Syria.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.170
I don't know about ISIS areas.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.370
I was trying to find Yusef.

14:02.420 --> 14:06.260
A woman called your house about adoption.
I was scared they would take Karim.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.780
Erm... No.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.780
That call was for me. I am...

14:17.220 --> 14:19.060
I was trying to adopt.

14:19.940 --> 14:24.220
But if you want children, why didn't
you have your own when you were younger?

14:28.980 --> 14:30.220
Because I can't.

14:32.340 --> 14:35.020
I said, no touching.
Leave us alone.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.730
I'm sorry, Emma. I didn't know.

14:43.780 --> 14:45.250
Oh, you couldn't know.

14:45.300 --> 14:49.380
It's the result of an operation
a long time ago, anyway.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.050
Please, Emma, get us out of here.

14:56.100 --> 14:59.100
I'll keep trying. I promise.

15:03.060 --> 15:04.620
You still have the SIM card?

15:08.660 --> 15:11.940
Can you give it to Yusef's nephew,
the one you met?

15:14.220 --> 15:16.020
Why? What's on it?

15:16.980 --> 15:18.730
I don't know.

15:19.780 --> 15:21.220
Just numbers.

15:31.940 --> 15:36.650
"I saw first-hand the devastating
impact Linda's death had on her family

15:36.700 --> 15:38.410
and on the community I represent.

15:38.460 --> 15:42.580
Why must these good people endure the
cruel indignity of an exhumation?"

15:43.620 --> 15:46.770
The original's already been sent
to the Chief Coroner's office.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.810
Thank you, Matthew.

15:48.860 --> 15:51.290
And you too, Mrs Wild.

15:51.340 --> 15:55.850
It's the least we could do.
Thanks, Matt.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.890
I just hope it makes a difference.

15:57.940 --> 16:01.090
How... How are the polls?
Close.

16:01.140 --> 16:03.050
Ah, you'll be fine.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.900
Drinks?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.050
Would you like to see Linda's room?

16:09.100 --> 16:09.623
Oh...

16:09.723 --> 16:13.900
I'd like to show it to you. Please?

16:23.060 --> 16:25.540
I know I should have
packed it all away but...

16:29.740 --> 16:31.740
.. somehow I...

16:34.540 --> 16:36.540
You've just got the one, don't you?

16:37.100 --> 16:39.340
Yes. Hugo.

16:43.980 --> 16:47.140
Imagine that one day
they're there and...

16:48.340 --> 16:51.820
.. nothing ever again.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.530
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:01.580 --> 17:04.099
I didn't mean to upset you.
No, no. It's OK.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.810
I have an idea.

17:08.859 --> 17:11.780
Another letter that you
could write about Linda.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.260
Steve?

17:38.180 --> 17:40.650
Hi, Dom. It's me. Can you come over?

17:40.700 --> 17:42.730
Where's Steve?

17:42.780 --> 17:45.170
He's disappeared. Got a job abroad.

17:45.220 --> 17:46.930
Just ran away.

17:46.980 --> 17:49.900
Three weeks in Norway,
photographing ski jumping.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.370
He knows sod-all about ski jumping.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.890
Anyway, how did it go today?

17:55.940 --> 17:58.890
Ten minutes after you
left the police station,

17:58.940 --> 18:00.970
Staines came out.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.010
Drove on his own to Raynes Park.

18:03.060 --> 18:04.890
The house he was in for
just under an hour.

18:04.940 --> 18:07.450
Did you see Pullings?
No. Couldn't get near him.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.650
Two big lads on the door,
minding the gate. But I did find this.

18:10.700 --> 18:14.890
From what I remember, I was hit by a
grey van. Look at the front bumper.

18:14.940 --> 18:16.570
It's dented.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.410
The van's registered to a
company in the Channel Islands,

18:19.460 --> 18:22.570
but who controls them and what they do,
I couldn't find out.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.611
What if Pullings sold
his story to a newspaper

18:24.811 --> 18:26.890
and these boys have been
sent to baby-sit him?

18:26.940 --> 18:29.610
What, they nearly kill you
because of an exclusive?

18:29.660 --> 18:32.540
No, I don't think so.
Hang on, can you scroll back?

18:37.900 --> 18:39.890
He went to the passenger side first,

18:39.940 --> 18:42.010
like he was expecting a left-hand drive.

18:42.060 --> 18:43.650
He's an American.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.970
Or French or German.

18:46.020 --> 18:47.940
Or Belgian, Dutch...

18:50.860 --> 18:53.500
F-16 tie pin. It's a US fighter.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.660
US Air Force bases.

19:00.060 --> 19:02.620
Remember Buxton's autopsy report?

19:03.940 --> 19:09.420
She said the soil in Linda's lungs
was impregnated with jet fuel.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.410
So Siobhan tells us about Pullings'
parties,

19:12.460 --> 19:16.130
Pullings is snatched by professionals.
American professionals.

19:16.180 --> 19:19.410
They're trying to hide something
that happened in or around the base

19:19.460 --> 19:22.700
six weeks before the Iraq war.
But what evidence do you have?

19:26.740 --> 19:28.460
We have her. Siobhan.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.930
But we need her.

19:31.980 --> 19:35.610
We need her body out of the ground
so we can find out how she died.

19:35.660 --> 19:39.970
And we need the creep who took these
because he knows what was going on.

19:40.020 --> 19:43.727
You're just going to go for this,
aren't you? Fuck the consequences.

19:43.827 --> 19:44.850
Is that wrong?

19:44.900 --> 19:48.620
These are some scary people, Em.
Do you really want to take them on?

20:28.740 --> 20:32.610
Mr Russell,
I'm writing to you about my daughter.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.690
Because your lawyer is asking the
courts if she can dig up her body.

20:36.740 --> 20:38.450
I know you're a dad.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.370
Imagine you lost your boy.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.420
Imagine how you would feel.

20:46.700 --> 20:50.610
Ah, Heather!
Sir Alastair.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.650
How did you get in here?

20:52.700 --> 20:55.810
Him. I helped his son get a Green Card.

20:55.860 --> 20:59.210
America, the country everyone hates
and everyone wants to live in.

20:59.260 --> 21:02.250
Really?
Why don't you go back there, then?

21:02.300 --> 21:04.770
The small matter of the
Kevin Russell retrial.

21:04.820 --> 21:06.770
Oh, that.

21:06.820 --> 21:12.090
I wonder if you even
needed the Pullings move.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.210
And its attendant risk.

21:14.260 --> 21:19.050
You forget, if I hadn't used Pullings,
the CPS would have contested the appeal,

21:19.100 --> 21:20.690
Russell would have walked

21:20.740 --> 21:25.210
and every journalist in England would have
been looking at the night that girl died.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.570
Ah, Matthew! Matthew.
Sir Alastair. Good of you to have us.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.620
Laura! Lovely as always.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.730
Meet Heather Myles.
Hello.

21:34.780 --> 21:38.170
She does something mysterious
for the American Government.

21:38.220 --> 21:40.300
No. My government days are long gone.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.410
Just another private sector desperado.

21:43.460 --> 21:45.450
Well, it's lovely to meet you.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.980
Sir Alastair, we'll catch up later.
Yes.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.890
So... he's running for the leadership.

21:54.940 --> 21:58.050
Will he win?
I think so, yeah.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.090
He's the real thing.

22:00.140 --> 22:02.530
A soldier who's seen action.

22:02.580 --> 22:06.090
He's as good a friend of
your country as you'll find.

22:06.140 --> 22:09.340
He's where your investment should lie.

22:19.220 --> 22:22.690
'What do you think of the defence move?
'I think it's immoral.

22:22.740 --> 22:25.090
Mrs Simms, do you agree?
Yes, I do agree.

22:25.140 --> 22:30.050
Exhumation... autopsy makes it sound
like it's OK. Like it's science research.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.850
And what it really means is digging
our Linda up from the ground

22:33.900 --> 22:36.650
where we buried her with our
love and our prayers and...

22:36.700 --> 22:38.450
cutting her up all over again!

22:38.500 --> 22:40.570
Are you going to attend
the Coroner's hearing?

22:40.620 --> 22:44.130
Yes, we are. We have a letter of
support from our MP, Matthew Wild.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.250
Yeah, and I've got a
letter from Kevin Russell.

22:46.300 --> 22:52.050
I wrote to him and I said to him, "Do
you want her to suffer all over again?"

22:52.100 --> 22:54.890
I didn't think we'd get
a reply but we did.

22:54.940 --> 22:59.780
And he said, "No. Let her rest in peace.
Don't let her suffer on my account."

23:09.260 --> 23:11.460
Where are you going?
Chief Coroner.

23:17.780 --> 23:19.530
My Lord. My Lord, I'm Emma Banville.

23:19.580 --> 23:23.570
I know who you are. The hearing's
tomorrow. Don't talk to me before then.

23:23.620 --> 23:27.170
The Simms family are talking to you.
With respect, they're using the press.

23:27.220 --> 23:30.570
And you don't? Goodbye, Ms Banville.
My Lord, you must see that

23:30.620 --> 23:33.017
the letter Kevin Russell
wrote is grossly prejudicial.

23:33.317 --> 23:34.890
Are you deaf? I'm not listening.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.780
You have to listen.

23:37.420 --> 23:41.090
Kevin Russell has been fucked by
our judicial system his entire life.

23:41.140 --> 23:44.090
I'm begging you, give him the
benefit of the doubt just once.

23:44.140 --> 23:48.620
Ms Banville. You don't talk to me.
I don't hear you.

23:57.820 --> 23:59.900
I thought it was the right thing to do.

24:01.820 --> 24:04.490
Does it hurt your case?
No, it hurts your case.

24:04.540 --> 24:07.290
We probably won't get the exhumation.
We needed it.

24:07.340 --> 24:09.370
Anyway, look, it's done.

24:09.420 --> 24:14.970
You were just trying to do the right thing.
Like trying to protect Miriam and Karim.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.250
It's those good deeds
that get us into trouble.

24:17.300 --> 24:21.210
Good deeds. Bad deeds. I don't know.
No.

24:21.260 --> 24:24.210
No. You do this to yourself.
You imagine guilt.

24:24.260 --> 24:26.610
Don't, Kevin. Kevin...

24:26.660 --> 24:28.460
I know you now.

24:29.780 --> 24:31.650
I know you didn't do it.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.580
But can you prove it?

24:36.180 --> 24:38.180
Without an autopsy?

24:41.100 --> 24:42.900
I don't know.

24:55.140 --> 24:56.700
He's sleeping now.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.730
But he was asking for you. Quite upset.

25:00.780 --> 25:03.300
Probably heard about
your latest headlines.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.850
It would be nice if you could try
not to make his last days awful.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.890
What do you want me to do, Mum?

25:11.940 --> 25:15.930
Do you want me to stop doing what I
believe in, what I'm actually good at?

25:15.980 --> 25:18.690
I want not to worry
about you all the time.

25:18.740 --> 25:20.740
I want you to be settled, to have a...

25:23.620 --> 25:25.380
Yes?

25:26.660 --> 25:28.490
Well, I had a chance.

25:28.540 --> 25:30.730
I had a chance at all those things.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.770
You were 18.
It would have ruined your life.

25:33.820 --> 25:38.380
I was 19 and how do we know what
it would have done to my life?

25:46.620 --> 25:48.330
How's work?

25:48.380 --> 25:52.180
It's going badly...
Couldn't be going any worse.

25:59.340 --> 26:02.250
Emma! Hamid sent me.
What?

26:02.300 --> 26:04.330
This way. Quickly.
Where is he?

26:04.380 --> 26:08.140
Hurry up!
I need to do my phone. Where's Hamid?

26:09.140 --> 26:10.860
This way.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.650
Doesn't Ruby always go offline
when she visits her father?

26:16.700 --> 26:19.250
Usually.
10:35. It's late to visit.

26:19.300 --> 26:22.140
Can you access the cameras?

26:23.540 --> 26:25.290
Can't see inside the car park.

26:25.340 --> 26:27.460
I can access the cameras in the street.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.340
And... the car park entrance.

26:32.420 --> 26:35.460
No sign in the last ten
but if I go back...

26:36.340 --> 26:37.970
One beat-up Volvo.

26:38.020 --> 26:39.250
9:53.

26:39.300 --> 26:42.490
But she doesn't disable her
phone until 40 minutes after.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.460
And she's still there.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.170
Emma.

26:49.220 --> 26:50.690
Hamid. What's going on?

26:50.740 --> 26:54.210
I'm sorry about this. Since Miriam was
arrested, we have to be extra careful.

26:54.260 --> 26:58.050
Fine. But her arrest means it's
more important that I speak to Yusef.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.130
He said he was coming back.
He's on his way.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.610
Yeah, good.
Cos I'm worried about Miriam and Karim.

27:02.660 --> 27:05.210
Trying to look after a toddler
in prison, it's not good.

27:05.260 --> 27:08.330
Where is the SIM card she gave you?
Why?

27:08.380 --> 27:11.610
Where is it? Simple question.
It's important to Yusef.

27:11.660 --> 27:15.170
Those numbers. People who have given
money and drugs to the clinics out there.

27:15.220 --> 27:17.290
He needs it. Things are very bad.

27:17.340 --> 27:20.290
Tell Yusef, when I see him,
I'll give it to him.

27:20.340 --> 27:22.380
No. We need it now.

27:23.260 --> 27:25.170
I'll give it to my client. No-one else.

27:25.220 --> 27:26.930
I said, where is it?

27:26.980 --> 27:29.420
Do you think I'm stupid
enough to carry it with me?

27:34.980 --> 27:36.706
The longer my phone's out,
the more I'm worried

27:36.806 --> 27:39.580
that SO15 are going
to be doing a sweep.

27:42.900 --> 27:44.900
Tell Yusef what I said.

28:23.780 --> 28:26.780
Hello?
Em! At last. Been trying to get you.

28:27.820 --> 28:31.610
Look, I've just been buzzed by SO15. I'm
going to have to change my phone again.

28:31.660 --> 28:33.490
Or my client.
Yusef Attar?

28:33.540 --> 28:36.050
I think he's a bad egg, Dom.
I think he's screwing me.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.090
Anyway, why did you call?

28:38.140 --> 28:40.610
The Chief Coroner granted your request.

28:40.660 --> 28:41.770
He what?

28:41.820 --> 28:45.250
I don't know what you said to him.
You got your request to dig up Linda.

28:45.300 --> 28:47.380
He said yes, Em. You've got your body.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.710
What are you doing here?

29:14.760 --> 29:18.230
What are you doing here?
I thought you didn't care about Russell.

29:18.280 --> 29:21.790
I don't. I care about Linda's family.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.190
What do you expect to find, exactly?

29:24.240 --> 29:26.390
I think Kevin was set up.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.240
I think Americans are involved.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.070
You really are something else.
No, sorry, will you wait? Please.

29:33.120 --> 29:36.630
This numberplate belongs to the
people who are hiding Pullings.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.960
What do you mean, hiding?
He's in a house in Raynes Park.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.840
You didn't know that, did you?

29:46.640 --> 29:49.520
The men that are guarding
Pullings are Americans.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.670
Why would Americans
want to hide Pullings?

29:52.720 --> 29:54.790
This isn't my case any more.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.470
But it is.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.270
We're the same in that, at least.

29:58.320 --> 30:03.680
Once we take a case or a client, they're
ours for always. For better or for worse.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.400
Come on, come on.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.280
You should go.
Please.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.880
Don't you want to know what
really happened that night?

30:58.680 --> 31:01.240
Olivia. Good morning.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.750
What's your interest in Kevin Russell?
The murderer?

31:13.800 --> 31:15.070
None. Why?

31:15.120 --> 31:16.910
I was asked to run a numberplate.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.030
It belongs to a company
which hires ex-military men

31:20.080 --> 31:23.990
for security at American embassies
and defence establishments.

31:24.040 --> 31:28.310
Now, that van is sat outside
a house in Raynes Park.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.280
Inside the house is Tony Pullings.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.510
A man whose porno photos ensured

31:34.560 --> 31:37.270
that Kevin Russell got a
retrial for Linda Simms' murder.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.750
I'm sorry, you've lost me.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.480
American ex-military personnel
are protecting Tony Pullings.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.160
Why?
I have no idea.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.110
When I interview Pullings,
what will he say?

31:48.160 --> 31:50.400
He'll say whatever he says.
I don't know.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.630
I thought you wanted to
talk about Miriam Attar.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.670
OK, yeah, let's do that.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.990
For two months, I've been
tracking Miriam's husband, Yusef.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.470
And I've been begging
for more GCHQ resources.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.350
And I have basically been ignored.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.950
Then Kevin Russell gets out on bail

32:07.000 --> 32:11.670
and suddenly I have all the resources that
I could possibly want, even the bloody NSA.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.680
Why should those things be connected?
Because they are.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.600
You connect them.

32:21.880 --> 32:26.440
So again,
why are you interested in Kevin Russell?

32:33.320 --> 32:35.280
You know who gave me the numberplate?

32:36.680 --> 32:38.710
Emma Banville.

32:38.760 --> 32:43.830
So, if you don't tell me the truth, I'm
going to tell Banville what I told you.

32:43.880 --> 32:49.440
That the Americans are sticking
their noses into our justice system.

32:50.600 --> 32:55.240
Now, what she does with that
information, I'll leave for you to guess.

32:58.320 --> 33:01.080
What's your interest in Kevin Russell?

33:04.320 --> 33:06.320
We have no interest in him.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.840
We have an interest... in you.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.350
What?

33:18.400 --> 33:21.630
Olivia Greenwood,
the rising star of SO15,

33:21.680 --> 33:23.210
a vital partner in preventing

33:23.410 --> 33:26.680
any terrorist attack against our
people or property in Europe.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.320
If you don't prosper,
our security suffers.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.480
You're winding me up.
Look at yourself, Olivia.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.280
You were fast-tracked to
the top and you know it.

33:43.120 --> 33:47.750
So how many... men of greater
experience have you left behind?

33:47.800 --> 33:51.280
And aren't they just dying
for you to make a mistake?

33:53.760 --> 33:56.080
Don't let Russell be it.

33:58.200 --> 34:03.480
Be grateful Pullings confirms
Russell's guilt and don't interfere.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.469
What are our chances, David?

34:13.520 --> 34:17.510
About 40/60. It's Pullings.
He damages your boy.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.270
What about the fact that
Pullings has been manipulated?

34:20.320 --> 34:22.830
Ah. By Emma's mysterious Americans.

34:22.880 --> 34:26.030
Sadly, I can't put a conspiracy
theory on the witness stand.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.630
If Olivia Greenwood comes through,
I can give you names to those Americans.

34:29.679 --> 34:32.400
I hope so. I also hope your
new autopsy gives us something

34:32.449 --> 34:34.850
cos if you've dug that
poor girl up for nothing...

34:36.040 --> 34:38.070
Olivia Greenwood for Emma.

34:38.120 --> 34:42.710
Emma Banville.
I... er... looked into that numberplate.

34:42.760 --> 34:46.110
It belongs to a Channel Islands company,
Castilen Limited.

34:46.159 --> 34:50.230
Handles security for UK companies...
banks, media organisations etc.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.059
Where do they hire their people from?

34:52.159 --> 34:54.469
The prospectus says
ex-military and ex-police.

34:54.520 --> 34:58.110
Americans?
No, Brits. But you can check them yourself.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.350
Castilen.

34:59.400 --> 35:03.470
So why are they protecting Pullings?
I have no idea. You want my guess?

35:03.520 --> 35:06.030
When he had to go to ground,
he hired them himself.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.030
Or perhaps the paper he sold his
dirty little story to hired them.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.870
It's too easy.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.390
Look, I followed your lead.
I found nothing.

35:13.440 --> 35:17.110
The Americans are not involved.

35:17.160 --> 35:21.440
Russell did it, you know. For all
your smoke and mirrors, he did it.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.640
Thanks for your help.

35:30.520 --> 35:33.230
Have you got anything?
Because if you don't, I am in trouble.

35:33.280 --> 35:35.080
I have something.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.270
I was curious about Linda's injuries,
especially to her legs.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.350
This is the original X-ray.
Shows fractures to both legs.

35:42.400 --> 35:45.590
Russell confessed to
hitting her with a shovel.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.640
Something like that.

35:49.040 --> 35:52.200
But I ran a CT scan. Have a look.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.390
I don't see any difference.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.910
They're wedge fractures,
not linear fractures. Look at the angle.

35:58.960 --> 36:03.110
It's dead straight, smashing
all four bones. One clean break.

36:03.160 --> 36:06.830
Russell also confessed to hitting
her on the head with the shovel.

36:06.880 --> 36:11.710
I ran a mass spectrometry of what remains
of the fascia and pericranium and found...

36:11.760 --> 36:14.750
Traces of nickel, vanadium, sulphur...

36:14.800 --> 36:17.830
What, from the shovel?
Only if it was made of bitumen.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.150
Her head was hit by a road.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.310
How the hell did they miss this?

36:22.360 --> 36:25.470
They knew she was buried in a wood,
Kevin said he hit her with a shovel.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.390
If you know what you're looking for,
that's what you'll find.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.545
So what did happen?

36:29.645 --> 36:33.000
Wedge fractures are usually
called bumper fractures.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.640
She was hit by a car.

36:40.200 --> 36:43.080
And the shovel's bollocks.
Complete bollocks.

36:43.840 --> 36:45.830
This is big.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.030
This is the win.
Not quite.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.200
Did Mr Russell have a car?

36:53.520 --> 36:55.520
Yeah, we had a car.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.240
But not that weekend.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.350
I'd taken it to London
with my best friend.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.800
Last chance of freedom
before the baby was born.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.360
What does this mean?

37:13.000 --> 37:14.710
Tell me, Emma. What does it mean?

37:14.760 --> 37:16.750
It proves he couldn't have done it.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.110
Linda was hit by a car.

37:19.160 --> 37:21.310
Kevin didn't have a car.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.640
Simple. He didn't do it.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.400
Jason.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.270
What is it?

37:42.320 --> 37:44.070
You should piss off.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.510
You and your lies.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.510
They're not lies.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.990
Your dad didn't do it.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.470
He's not my dad.
He is your dad.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.240
You've got to listen to me.

37:54.360 --> 37:59.230
He didn't do it. He didn't commit a
crime. A crime was committed against him.

37:59.280 --> 38:01.400
14 years of his life stolen.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.720
And do you know what kept him going?

38:05.960 --> 38:07.520
You did.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.270
He's innocent.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.800
We're gonna prove it.

38:26.940 --> 38:27.740
Come in.

38:33.540 --> 38:36.650
This is a surprise, sir.
I didn't know you were in the country.

38:36.700 --> 38:40.700
I was flying back from Riyadh. Thought
I'd stop in and see an old friend.

38:41.860 --> 38:42.970
Ah.

38:43.020 --> 38:46.660
The trial starts tomorrow. I hope
you've got something up your sleeve.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.810
I can hardly interfere in the
running of an Old Bailey trial.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.940
Pull the other one, it's got bells on.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.740
What's your risk assessment, Heather?

39:02.220 --> 39:03.530
Do help yourself.

39:03.580 --> 39:04.940
I will.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.300
Tony Pullings... is up first.

39:10.100 --> 39:14.620
He'll stick to the script but...
Banville has found one of his tarts.

39:15.340 --> 39:17.340
She opens the door to...

39:18.980 --> 39:21.620
Well,
you know what she opens the door to.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.337
But the issue is, the
defence pathologist has

39:25.537 --> 39:27.890
an alternate theory of
how the girl was killed.

39:27.940 --> 39:29.810
Then advance a counter-theory.

39:29.860 --> 39:33.140
That's hard when her
theory is actually true.

39:34.460 --> 39:36.780
Sorry, sir. I am out of moves.

39:44.900 --> 39:48.100
We've made you a wealthy and
successful woman, Heather.

39:50.260 --> 39:52.260
It's time to earn it.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.580
I think I've already earned it.

39:56.940 --> 39:59.540
Not until the job is finished.

40:03.580 --> 40:07.490
If this were to come out,
where do you think the axe would fall?

40:07.540 --> 40:09.170
Where does it always fall?

40:09.220 --> 40:12.900
Not on us. Not on the generals.
We stick together.

40:14.900 --> 40:18.660
We deny... and survive.

40:19.500 --> 40:26.540
The axe falls on the lieutenants,
the messengers with dirty hands.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.700
On you.

40:32.580 --> 40:36.450
You'll be the one on
all the front pages,

40:36.500 --> 40:39.220
your children stared at in the street...

40:40.820 --> 40:42.820
.. at school.

40:48.260 --> 40:49.780
Find the angle.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.380
Do your job.

41:23.340 --> 41:25.340
Please be seated, Mr Russell.

41:27.140 --> 41:32.380
Your Honour, I'd like to call my first
witness, Mr Tony Pullings, to the stand.

41:37.700 --> 41:41.290
Was the defendant present when you
photographed Linda at the school?

41:41.340 --> 41:44.940
No. He met us, gave me the key,
then I told him to scram.

41:46.220 --> 41:48.330
Did you pay him for his help?

41:48.380 --> 41:49.850
Yes. Ten quid.

41:49.900 --> 41:53.300
Then he asked me for a set of
the photos, which I gave him.

41:54.060 --> 41:56.370
Did you ask why he wanted them?

41:56.420 --> 41:59.260
Well... No, it was obvious why.

42:03.460 --> 42:07.180
Why didn't you come forward when
Linda disappeared, Mr Pullings?

42:08.260 --> 42:11.780
Surely this information would
have been useful to the police.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.210
I didn't because when she disappeared,

42:14.260 --> 42:17.300
that's when I realised she was
15 and I could be in big trouble.

42:19.380 --> 42:21.860
What other young girls
did you photograph?

42:23.220 --> 42:24.900
Young like Linda? None.

42:32.820 --> 42:36.690
If you're insinuating I went chasing
after schoolgirls, no, I didn't.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.460
What about the parties?

42:44.340 --> 42:46.340
Are they yours?

42:46.660 --> 42:48.660
Gosh, they look just like you.

42:50.340 --> 42:52.340
Do you want something?
I do.

42:53.140 --> 42:54.490
Have a look at this.

42:54.540 --> 42:59.140
Did you invite models to parties,
where they could meet wealthy men?

43:02.300 --> 43:04.090
Don't know about any parties.

43:04.140 --> 43:08.180
You're sure about that?
Yes. Quite sure.

43:11.900 --> 43:14.570
Did you sleep with any of your models?
No.

43:14.620 --> 43:18.810
Mr Pullings, have you done a deal with
the police in exchange for your testimony?

43:18.860 --> 43:21.450
No. Look, my case is with the
Crown Prosecution Service

43:21.500 --> 43:23.620
but whatever they decide,
my career's over.

43:25.180 --> 43:27.780
Thank you, Mr Pullings.
No further questions.

43:30.940 --> 43:32.930
Don't tell me. We've lost Siobhan.

43:32.980 --> 43:34.410
How did you know?

43:34.460 --> 43:37.450
The prosecution must have told
Pullings she wasn't gonna show.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.060
He's been lying his fucking face off.

43:55.100 --> 43:59.100
Siobhan, if you've made up your mind
not to testify, that's your right.

43:59.940 --> 44:01.530
I just want to know why.

44:01.580 --> 44:03.850
Because you lied.
How?

44:03.900 --> 44:06.170
You said they couldn't use Pullings'
photos of me.

44:06.220 --> 44:08.490
Well, they couldn't.
They're not relevant.

44:08.540 --> 44:11.410
That's not what I heard.
I heard they go everywhere.

44:11.460 --> 44:13.530
Papers, internet.

44:13.580 --> 44:17.690
My kids, my family, everyone would see
a stupid mistake I made 14 years ago.

44:17.740 --> 44:20.890
Well, they're wrong.
The photos can't be used like that.

44:20.940 --> 44:23.090
I mean,
you still don't even know if they exist.

44:23.140 --> 44:24.580
Oh, they exist.

44:25.500 --> 44:28.770
You've seen them?
Look, will you go? I've got my boys here.

44:28.820 --> 44:30.450
Who showed them to you? Please.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.730
No. Go. I'm done.
All right? Go on, piss off.

44:32.780 --> 44:35.770
Tell me. Just tell me...
Just tell me who showed them to you.

44:35.820 --> 44:37.650
Were they American?
Just go, please!

44:37.700 --> 44:40.130
Siobhan, they are trying
to destroy an innocent man.

44:40.180 --> 44:42.170
You're trying to destroy me.

44:42.220 --> 44:44.210
Well, she can protect me. You can't.

44:44.260 --> 44:47.220
She? Who's she? Siobhan!

44:52.380 --> 44:54.620
Yeah, Siobhan dropping out hurts us.

44:55.460 --> 44:57.610
So it's all about me now?

44:57.660 --> 44:59.130
And the forensics.

44:59.180 --> 45:00.820
Linda was hit by a car.

45:01.620 --> 45:03.620
Now, they can scare Siobhan away...

45:04.340 --> 45:06.650
but they can't scare a
car out of existence.

45:06.700 --> 45:08.690
But I had photos of Linda and I lied.

45:08.740 --> 45:10.287
I confessed to killing her.

45:10.487 --> 45:14.210
They'll question me on that and
I'll sound guilty. I know I will.

45:14.260 --> 45:18.090
Look, I'm sorry, I... I can't do it.
I can't go on the stand.

45:18.140 --> 45:22.940
I know you're afraid, Kevin. But all
you have to do is tell the truth.

45:23.980 --> 45:26.860
Then there is nothing the
prosecution can do to hurt you.

45:27.620 --> 45:32.100
Because it will all be out in the open.
Because Annie was right about you.

45:33.300 --> 45:35.170
You're a good man.

45:35.220 --> 45:38.820
And you'll win the jury.
I know you will.

45:41.060 --> 45:42.660
Will you do it?

45:47.120 --> 45:47.980
Yes.

45:50.740 --> 45:52.740
Good night, Kevin.

45:53.305 --> 45:59.555
