WEBVTT

00:04.326 --> 00:06.910
Ok, don’t mind us girls, we are just
prettying up the room...

00:07.139 --> 00:09.359
because we’re showing the house
later today.

00:09.797 --> 00:12.342
The listing said “finished basement”
and….

00:12.981 --> 00:14.270
finished !

00:16.234 --> 00:19.907
Well we’re not gonna be selling anything
if we don’t get rid of all this clutter, so uh...

00:20.311 --> 00:21.797
get the hell out.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.451
I can’t leave yet.
I told Fez I’d meet him here.

00:28.130 --> 00:30.392
He went to the airport to pick up
his best friend from back home.

00:30.919 --> 00:33.922
Oh great. Another mocca-skinned
weirdo in tight pants...

00:34.312 --> 00:37.203
who can make any word sounds
like boogadaboogadaboogada.

00:38.265 --> 00:40.036
You know he is coming to cheer
Fez up.

00:40.485 --> 00:42.688
The poor guy hasn’t been himself
since you rejected him.

00:43.922 --> 00:45.046
You know it’s weird, I actually...

00:45.609 --> 00:48.172
...miss his chocolaty stained finger
prints on my bras.

00:50.223 --> 00:52.908
Yeah well you know what ?
I don’t wanna see Fez.

00:53.406 --> 00:57.049
I mean, he called me ugly on the inside
and the outside. I’m sorry...

00:57.484 --> 00:59.688
...but he’s just wrong about
the outside part.

01:02.256 --> 01:03.705
- Holy crap man.
- What ?

01:05.037 --> 01:06.531
Listen to this letter from my Dad...

01:07.173 --> 01:10.689
“Dear valued Grooves-employee,
your services are no longer required.

01:10.984 --> 01:15.391
I’ve sold the chain of stores to a
dry-cleaning corporation for frankly
a buttload of money.

01:17.584 --> 01:20.832
You should see the cheque,
whoo-y.

01:23.705 --> 01:28.444
I thank you for your years of dedicated
service. As of Friday, you’re tresspassing.”

01:32.362 --> 01:34.111
Can you believe this man,
I’m out of a job !

01:34.659 --> 01:36.017
Well how do you think Leo feels ?

01:36.767 --> 01:38.973
Well, probably how he always feels.
Stoned.

01:42.642 --> 01:46.164
Everyone, I’d like you to meet
my best friend from back home :

01:46.447 --> 01:48.383
Andrew Davis.

01:49.737 --> 01:50.893
How do you do ?

01:52.224 --> 01:53.989
It’s so wonderful to be state-side.

01:56.051 --> 01:57.824
So you’re Fez’ friend ? From…

01:58.381 --> 01:59.708
wherever he’s from ?

02:01.135 --> 02:03.568
Yes. And I know exactly
who you are.

02:04.957 --> 02:09.050
You’re a frigid, unpleasant woman
who enjoys stomping on a man’s heart
for sport.

02:09.549 --> 02:11.527
You disgust me Jackie.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.581
Uh..I’m not Jackie.
I’m Donna.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.958
Well you are gorgeous.

02:20.447 --> 02:21.324
Sooo…

02:22.363 --> 02:24.042
you guys are from the same place ?

02:24.426 --> 02:26.895
Of course not. He’s from the westside
of the island.

02:31.273 --> 02:34.426

03:08.868 --> 03:10.558
You know, enough of this jibberjabber.

03:10.777 --> 03:12.233
I brought you folks a gift from
back home….

03:13.838 --> 03:16.152
Pretty good gift eh ?

03:17.447 --> 03:20.076
Take it easy though, a little goes
a long way.

03:21.558 --> 03:23.338
You know what else goes
a long way, man ?

03:24.154 --> 03:25.245
A lot !

03:26.235 --> 03:27.653
You know what else goes
a long way ?

03:28.203 --> 03:29.276
Spiders.

03:29.830 --> 03:33.620
That little guy made it all the way
from the lightbulb to the pipe.

03:34.528 --> 03:36.401
Way to go Mr. Spider !

03:37.948 --> 03:39.528
Don’t even think about it Andrew.

03:39.810 --> 03:41.651
Spiders here have very little meat.

03:43.405 --> 03:46.030
Regardless, it’s still so exciting
to be in America.

03:46.667 --> 03:49.527
It’s true what they say.
The streets are paved !

03:51.654 --> 03:53.965
I’m starting to feel weird guys.

03:55.174 --> 03:56.120
My hair is tingly...

03:56.841 --> 03:58.827
My palms are sweating and
my pulse is racing.

03:59.987 --> 04:01.716
Ow men...

04:03.120 --> 04:04.738
I think I overdid it !

04:05.809 --> 04:07.840
Stop jibberjabbering old boy.

04:09.373 --> 04:11.405
I told you the stuff was pretty strong.

04:11.748 --> 04:13.799
Just take a deep breath and relax.

04:18.043 --> 04:21.623
Yes. I’m sure you’ll be okay after
a few minutes.

04:22.560 --> 04:26.215
Until then, just continue to sweat
and grind your teeth.

04:30.624 --> 04:33.203
Or you can do what you usually do
when you’ve had too much.

04:33.685 --> 04:34.937
Switch to beer.

04:36.249 --> 04:38.123
Wow Hyde, are you okay ?!

04:39.216 --> 04:42.310
Of course I’m okay. It’s you that’s not
okay. But you’re me…

04:42.875 --> 04:44.999
...so if you’re not okay it means
I’m not okay which means...

04:45.810 --> 04:47.529
I’m going out of my freakin’ mind here !

04:49.082 --> 04:50.420
You’re gonna be fine.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.842
Do you guys think I should
change my hair ?

04:57.566 --> 04:59.770
Okay, well, the house is all set...

05:00.394 --> 05:02.458
Mr. and Mrs. Dubois should be
here any minute.

05:03.144 --> 05:04.168
Dubois ?

05:04.523 --> 05:06.479
Kitty, I don't want Germans
moving in here !

05:09.460 --> 05:10.865
I think they're French.

05:12.740 --> 05:16.821
Yes, and if they buy the house, they'll
give it up to the first German who knocks
at the door.

05:20.832 --> 05:23.359
Okay well I have to get to work.

05:24.302 --> 05:26.678
Are you sure you can show this
house by yourself ?

05:27.449 --> 05:31.387
Kitty, I showed a Japanese soldier
the inside of his own stomach...

05:31.601 --> 05:33.114
I think I can show a house.

05:37.099 --> 05:40.023
So, through there's the den,
back there is the kitchen...

05:40.463 --> 05:41.989
and upstairs are the bedrooms.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.139
Could we see them ?

05:47.053 --> 05:49.026
Oh, so my word's not good enough ?

05:52.452 --> 05:54.420
Well is there a bathroom upstairs ?

05:54.711 --> 05:57.226
No, we just whiz off the roof.

06:01.679 --> 06:04.804
In here you got the stove and the
fridge, both still under warranty.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.181
Oh. Is this the kitchen ?

06:09.950 --> 06:11.419
No...
It’s a petting zoo.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.172
There’s the goat...

06:17.711 --> 06:18.807
Pony-ride.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.652
Ah, there’s the dumbass !

06:25.032 --> 06:29.608
In here I built a whole workbench against
this wall so there is plenty of space
for all your tools.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.228
Actually I was thinking I could turn
it into a yoga-studio.

06:37.149 --> 06:38.111
Really...

06:38.545 --> 06:41.341
And I was thinking I could turn
your-ass-into-my-foot-studio.

06:50.434 --> 06:52.635
Randy !
What are you doing here ?

06:53.370 --> 06:54.556
Your Dad invited me over.

06:56.329 --> 06:58.622
I figured if you two talked, maybe
you’d get back together.

06:59.526 --> 07:01.431
I mean, it didn’t work for your
Mom and me but...

07:01.653 --> 07:04.339
...that was mostly because of sleeping
with strangers.

07:05.404 --> 07:08.057
Oh, so all of a sudden aunt Jenny
is a stranger ?!

07:11.516 --> 07:13.985
Donna I’m sure you don’t even want
to see me right now, but...

07:14.342 --> 07:15.935
...I never had a chance to tell you
how I feel.

07:16.746 --> 07:18.964
Straight from the heart, my own words.

07:20.464 --> 07:22.685
So I made you this mixed tape.

07:27.685 --> 07:30.029
"Grandma’s last words"…

07:31.716 --> 07:33.185
Oh I taped over that.

07:33.749 --> 07:36.111
You really couldn’t hear over
the respirator anyway.

07:43.357 --> 07:45.766
Oh Red.
How did it go showing the house ?

07:46.582 --> 07:49.062
Why don’t you ask all the dumbasses
that came through here ?!

07:50.843 --> 07:52.113
So poorly then…

07:54.094 --> 07:55.937
Maybe I should show the house.

07:56.311 --> 08:00.848
I heard that you're supposed to make
a home feel warm and friendly and inviting.

08:01.498 --> 08:03.596
So you should probably leave.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.992
Yeah I just don’t have the patience
for these people.

08:08.764 --> 08:12.658
I hate to admit it, but I wish
they were all dead.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.608
I'm telling you Leo,
yesterday in the basement...

08:20.280 --> 08:22.096
I had the worst trip I've ever had.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.686
Hey, I don't care how bad your trip
was, man...

08:24.905 --> 08:27.210
...you better have brought me back
a snow-globe or something.

08:33.688 --> 08:35.001
It was a total freak-out man.

08:35.376 --> 08:38.515
I had this hallucination that eveyone
else turned into me.

08:38.895 --> 08:41.722
It was me, and a whole bunch of me’s !

08:43.553 --> 08:44.602
Was I there ?

08:46.767 --> 08:47.554
No.

08:48.751 --> 08:49.939
That’s it Leo.
You know what ?

08:50.332 --> 08:52.564
I’m quitting the circle man. And I feel
really good about it.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.081
In fact, this calls for a celebration !

09:01.564 --> 09:03.565
I have no idea what to do...

09:04.648 --> 09:06.377
How can I turn down Jackie Burkhart ?

09:06.628 --> 09:08.369
I don’t even hang up my wrong numbers ?!

09:09.597 --> 09:11.501
Look, since there’s no chance
of anything with her...

09:11.878 --> 09:13.534
...why are you even sticking around
here anymore ?

09:14.065 --> 09:15.188
Well, where else would I go ?

09:15.706 --> 09:17.566
Home old boy ! Come home.

09:18.252 --> 09:19.064
Home ?

09:20.862 --> 09:22.127
Yeah, that's a good idea !

09:24.115 --> 09:25.430
I'll go back to Brazil...

09:25.911 --> 09:26.861
and then...

09:27.148 --> 09:28.743
I'll catch a flight home from there.

09:35.252 --> 09:36.315
Oh, coming !

09:38.940 --> 09:44.037
Oh hello there. I’m Kitty Forman,
I’m so excited to show you my home.

09:47.317 --> 09:54.678
Okay now, this is the living room
where I have spend many happy hours…

09:55.082 --> 09:57.682
Not “happy hours” like, at a bar.

09:58.584 --> 10:02.662
Although I would be lying if I said
I didn’t try to start that up around here.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.816
No, but...

10:05.775 --> 10:09.521
I have spend many wonderful times
with the kids in here.

10:10.556 --> 10:12.727
Before they moved so very far away.

10:13.786 --> 10:15.725
Oh sad ! Okay follow me.

10:18.351 --> 10:22.465
And this is my kitchen.

10:23.183 --> 10:27.693
And this is the table where Eric would
do his homework and Laurie would do her nails.

10:28.273 --> 10:30.353
You know some people used
to call her a tramp...

10:30.353 --> 10:33.695
...but that’s not fair there’s nothing
wrong with being friendly.

10:35.102 --> 10:40.225
You know, I guess the four of us will
never sit here together again…

10:42.633 --> 10:44.318
Okay, let’s move on.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.647
Now...

10:48.022 --> 10:52.602
...this is the dining room where we’d
have all our special dinners.

10:53.131 --> 10:56.179
And Red’s mother used to always
tell me my pot-roast is too dry...

10:56.541 --> 10:58.462
...but what does she know
she’s in hell now...

11:02.654 --> 11:03.625
You know I...

11:05.542 --> 11:09.836
...uh I always thought that I would serve
dinner to my grandchildren in here.

11:10.930 --> 11:13.886
Oh my gosh, I’m just choking up.

11:14.698 --> 11:18.697
Okay, uhm and here,
okay this is the den.

11:23.026 --> 11:24.593
Oh. Uhm...

11:25.726 --> 11:29.447
And these are the marks
on the wall where...

11:30.243 --> 11:33.197
...we measured the kids height
when they were growing up…

11:35.481 --> 11:37.243
But you’ll probably you’ll just….

11:38.760 --> 11:40.165
...paint over this...

11:41.123 --> 11:43.525
You unfeeling bastards !
Yeah !

11:43.821 --> 11:47.168
You will get this house when you pry
it from my cold, dead fingers…

11:47.433 --> 11:51.969
Oh in fact, let me show you
one more thing, the door !

12:01.770 --> 12:03.646
Hey Steven, what are you doing ?

12:04.584 --> 12:06.661
I’m painting this model I just finished.

12:09.537 --> 12:11.870
I have a lot more free time now
that I have quit the circle.

12:13.380 --> 12:16.067
W… you quit the circle ?!
What are you…high ?!

12:19.570 --> 12:21.811
I don’t do that anymore Jackie.

12:22.746 --> 12:23.864
I don’t need to.

12:25.757 --> 12:29.054
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
I’m going for a jog...

12:32.834 --> 12:34.599
Oh, and if you see Mrs. Forman...

12:35.035 --> 12:37.069
can you let her know that I’ll be
making the salad tonight ?

12:45.294 --> 12:46.779
Oh. It’s you...

12:47.855 --> 12:50.340
I’m here to get some things belonging
to the man whose heart you broke.

12:51.128 --> 12:52.372
Cause he’s packing and leaving.

12:53.003 --> 12:55.731
Now who is this Kitty and where
is her underwear ?

12:57.261 --> 13:00.345
Wait, wait, wait, Fez is leaving ?

13:00.888 --> 13:01.936
Why ?

13:03.002 --> 13:05.688
Oh because of you.
He is in bad shape Jackie.

13:06.637 --> 13:08.530
W... he hurt me first !

13:10.027 --> 13:11.340
Do you know what he told me ?

13:11.733 --> 13:14.230
He said that if he could go back in time
and take back five words,

13:14.878 --> 13:16.016
those words would be :

13:16.482 --> 13:19.669
Now you’re ugly on the outside,
just like you are on the inside.

13:24.607 --> 13:26.796
That’s more then five words.

13:28.856 --> 13:30.906
All his words run together,
he doesn’t know.

13:32.326 --> 13:35.004
So I said to him why would you want
to take those words back ?

13:35.920 --> 13:36.935
And he said to me...

13:37.217 --> 13:40.535
...so he wouldn’t have to go through life
knowing he’d hurt the woman he loved.

13:43.561 --> 13:46.519
And you broke his heart.
You disgust me !

13:49.581 --> 13:53.608
I..I…I frankly don’t understand why
any man would ever want to be with you.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.851
So….want to make out ?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.532
So what do you think ?

14:22.334 --> 14:25.125
Look I just…I think we both need
to move on with our lives.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.079
I’m sorry.

14:28.944 --> 14:30.642
Oh well.
I gave it a shot.

14:31.798 --> 14:35.015
But you’re making a big mistake,
because I am the best thing that
is ever gonna happen to you...

14:36.861 --> 14:38.833
Really ? Still nothing ?

14:41.049 --> 14:44.660
Huh. So, friends then ?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.611
Alright.

14:56.101 --> 14:57.206
Hey guys...

14:58.997 --> 15:00.339
What’s going on ?

15:01.109 --> 15:03.484
Steven.
We need to talk man.

15:08.233 --> 15:11.136
We’re here because we are
your friends and we love you.

15:13.623 --> 15:16.156
But ever since you quit the circle,
you’ve changed.

15:17.312 --> 15:20.185
I mean, what’s this I hear about
you eating a vegetable ?!

15:23.426 --> 15:24.327
Look at you.

15:24.739 --> 15:26.779
Your eyes are clear, your shirt is clean.

15:28.299 --> 15:30.505
I hardly recognize you.

15:33.582 --> 15:35.654
You have a problem with drugs man.

15:37.251 --> 15:38.501
I don’t have a problem !

15:38.907 --> 15:40.428
I can start any time I want !

15:41.866 --> 15:44.562
Oh yeah ? Then why don’t you
start right now ?

15:45.156 --> 15:46.867
Or don’t you have the guts ?

15:48.985 --> 15:50.501
You guys don’t understand.

15:51.003 --> 15:53.300
The last time I was in the circle,
I totally freaked out !

15:54.147 --> 15:55.803
I know why you freaked out man.

15:56.469 --> 15:59.422
All your friends are leaving and
the recordstore is closing.

16:00.177 --> 16:01.907
Your life is changing man.

16:02.830 --> 16:05.272
See it’s not the circle that’s
the problem.

16:06.117 --> 16:07.767
It’s that your life is crap.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.531
Oh my God.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.589
I’ve been using sobriety as a crutch.

16:22.722 --> 16:24.020
I need help !

16:27.567 --> 16:29.065
We’re here for you.

16:30.244 --> 16:32.754
Hold out your hands man...

16:41.346 --> 16:42.941
I love you guys !

16:50.348 --> 16:52.380
Red, I have bad news.

16:52.659 --> 16:55.255
The people I showed the house to,
they just weren’t interested.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.195
I have no idea why.

17:03.196 --> 17:06.556
It doesn’t matter. The clown who
does yoga made an offer.

17:07.739 --> 17:12.523
So I said, it’s a deal, you
downward-facing dumbass.

17:15.878 --> 17:16.786
Isn’t it great ?!

17:16.993 --> 17:19.304
A month from now, we’ll be in Florida.

17:20.244 --> 17:21.181
Yeah…

17:21.740 --> 17:24.461
Far away from all our family and friends.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.151
Ah Jeez Kitty...

17:28.068 --> 17:31.652
put it like that we should leave tonight !

17:36.959 --> 17:38.131
Hey there son !

17:39.072 --> 17:39.973
WB…

17:40.442 --> 17:41.899
Ah I guess you heard the news, huh.

17:42.701 --> 17:43.726
Yeah.

17:44.286 --> 17:46.196
Well I got some more great news for ya.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.036
I bought a Corvette !

17:51.724 --> 17:53.497
Good for you man.
You know...

17:54.196 --> 17:56.193
...you didn’t have to come all the way
down here to tell me that.

17:56.526 --> 17:57.948
You could have just sent it
in a form letter.

17:58.287 --> 18:01.101
“Dear employee, bought a Corvette.
Whoo-yyyy !”.

18:04.771 --> 18:09.823
Listen Steven, that letter was just for
the faceless employees that I don’t
even care about.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.384
Hey thanks for the letter man.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.477
Look, I wanted to come here personally
to tell you the big news.

18:19.869 --> 18:21.288
I’m giving you this store.

18:21.790 --> 18:24.322
Yes, you’re the proud owner of
the last remaining Grooves.

18:27.727 --> 18:29.320
Holy crap, I own this place ?

18:30.600 --> 18:34.744
Yep. You can even rename it something
more appropriate to this lilly-white community.

18:36.196 --> 18:37.697
You can call it Rhythm-less.

18:38.748 --> 18:40.967
Or Snap-At-The-Wrong-Time.

18:45.260 --> 18:46.603
Wow man. It’s…

18:47.758 --> 18:50.542
it’s like the nicest thing anyone
of my Dad’s has ever done for me.

18:52.853 --> 18:54.999
You know, this goes to show you...

18:55.640 --> 18:58.447
if you sit on your ass long enough,
good stuff will happen.

18:59.852 --> 19:03.436
Yup.
That is some good stuff.

19:05.073 --> 19:06.823
I’ve missed you Hyde.

19:07.219 --> 19:10.324
Just like they always say, hey Leo,
how’s it going ?

19:12.339 --> 19:15.218
Son, if this is how you gonna run
this store now that it’s yours...

19:15.978 --> 19:17.064
I gotta tell ya...

19:17.354 --> 19:19.604
I’m gonna be stopping by
a lot more often !

19:24.823 --> 19:27.042
Oh Fez, I’m so glad you’re still here.

19:27.906 --> 19:31.605
Yes. I wanted to take one last look
at the basement before I leave.

19:32.813 --> 19:34.918
Look Fez, Andrew told me what you said.

19:35.714 --> 19:37.845
And now that I know,
I can’t let you leave.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.761
I’m sorry Jackie. It’s too late.
I’m leaving.

19:43.263 --> 19:45.417
There’s nothing anybody can say
to get me to stay.

19:46.357 --> 19:47.417
I wanna be your girlfriend.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.482
- I’ll stay.
- You will ?!

19:52.624 --> 19:56.028
Yes. But I don’t wanna be just
some rebound for you.

19:56.392 --> 19:57.191
And I need to know that...

19:57.450 --> 19:59.795
...you’re not gonna leave me when
something better comes along.

19:59.795 --> 20:02.170
Fez there is no-one better for me
then you !

20:03.450 --> 20:06.731
I’m just sorry that it took me so long
to figure that out.

20:08.980 --> 20:10.059
You really mean that ?

20:10.879 --> 20:14.343
Of course !
Fez, I wanna be with you...

20:15.763 --> 20:18.374
And I’m so happy that we can
finally be together.

20:20.733 --> 20:25.076
Wow. I’ve been waiting so long
to hear those three words...

20:33.343 --> 20:36.059
Man, I can’t believe I’m not gonna
be around to see you two together.

20:36.706 --> 20:38.092
It’s gonna be one of two ways.

20:38.456 --> 20:40.592
It could be a disaster or a catastrofy.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.928
Blablabla, you always say you’re
leaving, but you never do.

20:47.906 --> 20:51.154
I am serious, I’m finally gonna get out
of this town and do something with my life.

20:52.469 --> 20:55.875
Eric called, he's coming home,
he's coming home !

20:58.271 --> 20:59.780
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

21:04.865 --> 21:06.238
So you grew up with Fez, huh ?

21:07.240 --> 21:09.896
You know, we’ve been wondering
something for a long time...

21:10.345 --> 21:11.984
Where the hell are you guys from ?

21:13.271 --> 21:15.280
Uhm, isn’t it obvious ?

21:16.647 --> 21:18.817
Okay, just tell us what’s the name
of your country ?

21:19.567 --> 21:22.047
Well, that depends on wether you
ask the British or the Dutch.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.157
Okay, so what if we ask the British ?

21:25.470 --> 21:28.157
Oh no no no. They wouldn’t tell you.
They hate us.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.177
Soooo... What if we ask the Dutch ?

21:31.583 --> 21:34.066
Oh, who can understand a word
they say ?!
