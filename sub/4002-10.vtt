10:22.542 --> 10:25.583
WHATEVER IT IS,
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.834
(Dexter)
A POTENTIAL WITNESS,
A MISSING RING.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.583
NOW MIGUEL AND I HAVE
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.458
HEY, NOT SO FAST.
NOT SO FAST.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.125
I AM TAKING DONATIONS
FOR DEXTER MORGAN'S

10:37.125 --> 10:38.250
[whispers]
BACHELOR PARTY.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.542
PRODUCED AND DIRECTED
BY VINCE MASUKA,

10:40.542 --> 10:42.166
A VINCE MASUKA PRODUCTION.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.709
DIG DEEP NOW.
IT'S GONNA BE OFF THE CHARTS.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.375
I'M GONNA HAVE
SERGEANT COP-A-FEEL,

10:45.375 --> 10:48.625
JO-JO THE LEZBO GO-GO,
MAUREEN THE LIMBER MERMAID,

10:48.625 --> 10:49.834
AND HER EVEN MORE
LIMBER FRIEND

10:49.834 --> 10:51.917
NADIA THE RUSSIAN GYMNAST.

10:54.041 --> 10:55.458
WHAT?

10:55.458 --> 10:58.291
VINCE, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF TWO BIG INVESTIGATIONS.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.667
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.041
IT'S HARD TO GET PEOPLE
FOCUSED ON THIS SHINDIG.

11:01.041 --> 11:03.834
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT MAYBE YOU
SHOULD KEEP THE PARTY LOW-KEY.

11:03.834 --> 11:04.917
ARE YOU KIDDING?

11:04.917 --> 11:06.792
I'VE GOT A REPUTATION
TO LIVE UP TO.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.625
I MEAN, IF MY SHOW
DOES NOT MAKE PEOPLE VOMIT

11:08.625 --> 11:10.583
AND HAVE AN ERECTION
AT THE SAME TIME,

11:10.583 --> 11:12.166
THEN I'VE LET
MY AUDIENCE DOWN.

11:12.166 --> 11:14.375
STRIPPERS, YES.
HOOKERS, NO.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.041
AND NONE OF THAT WEIRD
SHIT THAT YOU'RE INTO.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.125
WOW. OKAY,
SERGEANT BUZZKILL.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.333
I MEAN IT.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.417
ANYTHING ILLEGAL,
I WILL ARREST YOU.

11:21.417 --> 11:23.667
COME ON.
I WAS JUST JOKING.

11:23.667 --> 11:24.667
THE PARTY'S
FOR OPIE OUT THERE.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.125
A HOOKER IS A TERRIBLE
THING TO WASTE.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.959
DAMN IT.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.500
I'M NEVER GONNA
GET MY DEPOSIT BACK.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.583
YES, MA'AM, YOUR LANDSCAPER.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.667
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

11:41.917 --> 11:44.417
OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY EMPTY
STRUCTURES ON YOUR PROPERTY

11:44.417 --> 11:47.041
OR UNOCCUPIED VACATION HOMES
IN THE AREA?

11:48.875 --> 11:51.041
RIGHT, MA'AM, WE'LL BE
SURE TO CLEAR 'EM

11:51.041 --> 11:53.834
JUST AS FAST AS WE CAN SO YOU
DON'T HAVE TO RE-SOD YOUR LAWN,

11:53.834 --> 11:55.333
YOU FUCKHEAD.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.834
WHAT'S THIS?

11:58.834 --> 12:02.000
SURVEILLANCE REPORT
FROM ANTON'S PROTECTIVE DETAIL.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.542
PRETTY THOROUGH.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.250
HE CAME OVER
ON OFFICIAL BUSINESS.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.750
WHICH TOOK ALL NIGHT.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.208
SARGE IS GONNA SEE THAT.

12:09.208 --> 12:12.291
I'LL TELL HIM THE TRUTH,
THAT NOTHING HAPPENED.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.458
SO YOU'RE NO LONGER
SLEEPING WITH THE...

12:14.458 --> 12:16.500
KEY WITNESS
IN THIS INVESTIGATION?

12:16.500 --> 12:18.667
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

12:18.667 --> 12:21.041
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S YOUR SHIELD.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.417
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TALKIN',
BE MY GUEST.

12:26.625 --> 12:28.875
YOU'VE RUN OUT OF PEOPLE
TO TRANSFER ME TO?

12:28.875 --> 12:31.834
YOUR EMBASSY ISN'T THAT BIG.
OYEME...

12:31.834 --> 12:34.750
GEORGE WASHINGTON KING.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.375
NO, NO, NO,
DO NOT TRANSFER ME BACK--

12:36.375 --> 12:37.375
ESCUCHEME--

12:37.375 --> 12:39.709
HOMICIDE.

12:39.709 --> 12:42.208
SARGE, LINE TWO.
SAYS IT'S URGENT.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.792
SERGEANT BATISTA.

12:51.458 --> 12:52.792
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.166
COVER FOR ME.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.875
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
NO.

12:59.875 --> 13:04.083
IT'S ALL ABOUT STRATEGY,
OUTMANEUVERING THE OPPOSITION,

13:04.083 --> 13:05.333
BENDING HIM YOUR WILL.

13:05.333 --> 13:08.834
[game noises]

13:08.834 --> 13:12.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY OFFICE, DEX?

13:14.125 --> 13:16.000
WINNING.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.291
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.250
JUST KEEPING MY WITS SHARP
WHILE I WAITED FOR YOU.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.917
YOU, UH, HERE TO GRAB...

13:23.917 --> 13:24.959
LUNCH OR SOMETHING?

13:24.959 --> 13:26.125
CAN'T.

13:26.125 --> 13:29.542
GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE STATION.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.000
THE ELLEN WOLF CASE
IS BREAKING.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.083
BREAKING.

13:34.083 --> 13:35.375
WHICH WAY?

13:35.375 --> 13:37.917
IT SEEMS LIEUTENANT
LAGUERTA HAS A SUSPECT.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.291
AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE?

13:40.291 --> 13:42.875
SOME GUY WHO WAS...

13:42.875 --> 13:45.125
OUTSIDE ELLEN'S PLACE
ROUND ABOUT THE TIME

13:45.125 --> 13:46.750
SHE WAS GETTIN'
STRANGLED.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.709
OR WAS SHE STABBED FIRST?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.583
HE COULDN'T
HAVE SEEN ANYTHING.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.959
YOU SURE?

14:04.667 --> 14:08.417
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

14:08.417 --> 14:11.333
WE? HA.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.834
WE ARE PARTNERS.

14:15.834 --> 14:18.542
YEAH, BUT SEE,
HERE'S THE THING, MIGUEL.

14:18.542 --> 14:21.125
I DON'T REALLY
WANT A PARTNER.

14:21.125 --> 14:24.667
HEY, I'M NOT GIVING UP
ON OUR FRIENDSHIP, DEX.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.500
HELL, I-I'M STANDING UP
AT YOUR WEDDING.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.083
YEAH. BUT AFTER THAT,
YOU GO YOUR OWN WAY.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.333
AND WE BOTH GO BACK
TO WHO WE WERE

14:32.333 --> 14:33.625
BEFORE ALL OF THIS--

14:33.625 --> 14:34.959
YOU AN HONORABLE ADA

14:34.959 --> 14:37.583
DEDICATED TO UPHOLDING
THE LAW OF THE LAND...

14:37.583 --> 14:38.542
AND YOU?

14:38.542 --> 14:40.375
A TRUSTY SPATTER ANALYST

14:40.375 --> 14:42.041
WHO ALWAYS GETS HIS KILLER.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.500
IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT?

14:49.500 --> 14:50.875
I'M IN A POSITION

14:50.875 --> 14:54.583
TO PROTECT THE ADA'S INTERESTS
IN THIS CASE.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.750
I'LL DO WHAT IT TAKES

14:55.750 --> 14:57.875
TO KEEP THE INNOCENT PEOPLE
OF MIAMI SAFE.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.333
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT?

15:11.542 --> 15:13.917
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.458
GAME OVER.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.417
BARBARA GIANNA?
IN THERE.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.333
WHAT DO WE KNOW?
NOT MUCH.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.250
THE MEDS FOR THE PAIN
HAVE HER PRETTY BLURRY.

15:40.250 --> 15:44.041
HEY, YOU THAT, UH, HOMICIDE
GUY SHE KEEPS TALKIN' ABOUT?

15:44.041 --> 15:45.500
SHE TALKS ABOUT ME?

15:45.500 --> 15:47.709
SHE SAYS YOU SNORE
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.

15:54.834 --> 15:55.834
HEY.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.375
HEY, YOURSELF.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.917
HOW YOU DOING?

16:02.917 --> 16:08.417
I FEEL LIKE I GOT A BUICK
PARKED ON MY HEAD.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.834
WASN'T RAPED...IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.667
I JUST GOT BEAT ON
A LITTLE.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.458
BY WHO?
ANY IDEAS?

16:15.458 --> 16:18.041
BEST I CAN TELL...

16:18.041 --> 16:21.417
SOME WOULD-BE JOHN
SAW ME ON THE STROLL.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.792
ASSHOLE FOLLOWED ME HOME.

16:23.792 --> 16:25.291
SO YOU GOT A LOOK
AT HIM.

16:25.291 --> 16:26.792
MM-HMM.

16:26.792 --> 16:30.125
TALL, BLOND,
GOOD LOOKING.

16:30.125 --> 16:31.291
MM.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.083
STRONG.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.875
MY WEAPON
WAS IN MY PURSE.

16:36.875 --> 16:39.542
ALL I HAD WERE MY KEYS.

16:39.542 --> 16:42.500
GOT MY LICKS IN.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.000
HE'LL BE A LITTLE...

16:44.000 --> 16:46.625
LESS HANDSOME TOMORROW.

16:51.458 --> 16:53.667
YOU DID GOOD.

16:55.375 --> 16:56.959
[whispering]
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

16:56.959 --> 16:58.542
[whispering]
HELL, YEAH, I'M HERE.

16:58.542 --> 17:01.834
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

17:01.834 --> 17:04.041
AND, UH,
JUST FOR THE RECORD...

17:07.333 --> 17:09.750
I DON'T SNORE
LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER.

17:09.750 --> 17:12.500
(woman)
EXCUSE ME...WE NEED TO GET

17:12.500 --> 17:14.166
DETECTIVE GIANNA UPSTAIRS
FOR A CAT SCAN,

17:14.166 --> 17:15.709
SEE IF WE CAN
RELEASE HER.

17:15.709 --> 17:16.875
RELEASE HER?

17:16.875 --> 17:18.583
I'M NOT THAT BAD,
ANGEL.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.041
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.

17:25.834 --> 17:27.583
I'LL TALK TO YOU
LATER, OKAY?

17:40.875 --> 17:42.583
DETECTIVE GIANNA
THINKS SHE GOT

17:42.583 --> 17:43.959
A PIECE OF THE ASSAILANT
WITH THESE.

17:43.959 --> 17:46.875
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
A BLONDE GUY, TALL.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.125
COULD BE A JOHN.

17:48.125 --> 17:51.375
MAYBE ONE OF YOUR OTHER
DECOYS MIGHT HAVE SEEN HIM.

17:51.375 --> 17:55.000
WE'RE ALL OVER THIS.
THANKS, SERGEANT.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.667
GET THIS DOWN
TO THE LAB FAST.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.041
ANGEL.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.083
WHAT CAN I
DO YOU FOR?

18:10.083 --> 18:13.041
I, UH, NEED YOU TO TEST
THIS FOR BLOOD.

18:13.041 --> 18:14.333
IF IT COMES BACK POSITIVE,

18:14.333 --> 18:15.875
RUN IT THROUGH
THE CRIMINAL DATABASE.

18:15.875 --> 18:17.750
NO PROB.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.500
MIGHT TAKE A DAY OR TWO
FOR SEQUENCING.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.750
UH, GREASE IT.

18:20.750 --> 18:23.208
I MEAN, IT'S...
IT'S A PRIORITY.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.208
SURE.

18:24.208 --> 18:25.333
THANKS.

18:25.333 --> 18:26.959
IS THIS ELLEN WOLF
OR THE SKINNER?

18:26.959 --> 18:29.208
THERE'S NO CASE NUMBER.
UH, IT'S...

18:29.208 --> 18:32.583
IT'S MORE OF...
AN INTERNAL THING.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.917
YOU KNOW?
MY EYES ONLY.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.917
YOUR EYES ONLY.

18:36.917 --> 18:38.125
THANKS.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.917
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

18:48.917 --> 18:50.500
YOU WERE COMING ON
TO ELLEN.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.834
I WAS THERE.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.625
SHE CAME ON TO ME.

18:53.625 --> 18:56.041
I FLIRTED BACK.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.625
IT'S PART OF THE JOB,
YOU KNOW?

18:57.625 --> 18:59.959
HOW YOU EARN TIPS.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.792
SHE LEFT ME 20
ON A $30 TAB.

19:03.792 --> 19:06.625
YOU FIGURED THERE WAS MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.125
YOU CALLED HER AGAIN

19:08.125 --> 19:13.625
AT 11:10 P.M.,
THEN AT 3:01 AND 3:08 A.M.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.875
THAT'S PRETTY LATE TO BE
CALLING SOMEONE YOU JUST MET.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.834
I CALLED ON MY BREAK.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.500
I TOLD HER I DIDN'T
GET OFF WORK TILL AFTER 2:00.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.250
SHE SAID TO COME OVER
ANYWAY.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.208
AND THEN I CALLED AGAIN

19:25.208 --> 19:26.625
TO TELL HER I WASN'T
GOING TO MAKE IT.

19:26.625 --> 19:27.792
SHE DIDN'T ANSWER.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.792
I CALLED ONE MORE TIME
JUST IN CASE.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.667
NO ONE PICKED UP.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.917
FOR SOMEONE SO INNOCENT,
HE SURE LOOKS GUILTY.

19:35.917 --> 19:38.667
LOOKS LIKE A KILLER
TO ME.

19:38.667 --> 19:40.333
HE'S NOT.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.041
WELL, BUT HE COULD BE.

19:43.667 --> 19:45.875
YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I THINK HAPPENED?

19:45.875 --> 19:49.000
I THINK THAT YOU SHOWED UP
AT HER HOUSE UNANNOUNCED,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.208
LOOKING FOR SEX.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.625
SHE WOULDN'T GIVE IT UP,
AND YOU LOST YOUR TEMPER.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.500
THAT'S NOT WHAT
HAPPENED.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.792
AND THEN YOU CLED TWICE

19:56.792 --> 19:58.542
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOU
THOUGHT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.041
THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

20:00.041 --> 20:01.625
ANY PRIORS?

20:01.625 --> 20:05.750
YOU SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE WORD INNOCENT.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.834
NO ONE'S GETTIN'
FRAMED FOR THIS.

20:07.834 --> 20:08.917
HEY, YOUR BALL GAME.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.291
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

20:10.291 --> 20:11.917
CURIOSITY.

20:11.917 --> 20:14.417
YOU CAN'T BLAME ME,
CAN YOU?

20:14.417 --> 20:16.166
(Laguerta)
SO YOU DIDN'T GO
OVER TO HER HOUSE?

20:16.166 --> 20:17.542
NO.

20:17.542 --> 20:18.834
I WENT HOME.

20:18.834 --> 20:21.125
YOU'RE FUCKING LYING, TOBY.

20:21.125 --> 20:24.625
THESE TWO CALLS WERE ROUTED
THROUGH A CELL PHONE TOWER

20:24.625 --> 20:26.458
A BLOCK AWAY FROM HER HOUSE.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.417
U WERE THERE--

20:27.417 --> 20:29.250
ALL RIGHT!

20:31.208 --> 20:32.834
I HAVE A FIANCEE...

20:34.291 --> 20:37.875
WHO'S NOT GONNA LIKE
HEARING ABOUT A BOOTY CALL.

20:37.875 --> 20:40.917
SO YOU WENT THERE.
SHE CHANGED HER MIND.

20:40.917 --> 20:43.125
YOU GOT ANGRY--
NO. NO!

20:43.125 --> 20:45.083
I MEAN, YES,
I WENT TO HER PLACE,

20:45.083 --> 20:47.542
BUT SHE DIDN'T
ANSWER THE DOOR.

20:47.542 --> 20:51.083
SO I CALLED--TWICE.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.208
I FIGURED SHE FELL ASLEEP.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.417
I WENT HOME.
I SWEAR TO GOD.

20:55.417 --> 20:58.500
NOT MUCH OF A SUSPECT.
NOT MUCH OF A WITNESS.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.250
[knocking]

21:00.250 --> 21:02.625
LIEUTENANT,
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

21:02.625 --> 21:04.625
(Dexter)
HMM. NEW DEVELOPMENT.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.041
NEVER KNOW WHAT'LL POP UP.

21:06.041 --> 21:08.583
WELL...I'LL KNOW.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.792
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED,
AS PROMISED.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.667
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND
TO HAVE.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.125
I'M JUST GONNA STAY HERE.

21:14.125 --> 21:15.709
MY CURIOSITY'S PIQUED.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.083
(Laguerta)
HE'S LYING THROUGH
HIS TEETH.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.041
WE CAN PUT HIM
AT THE SCENE.

21:20.041 --> 21:23.250
HE'S, UH,
NOT OUR GUY.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.792
(Laguerta)
THE FUCK HE'S NOT.

21:24.792 --> 21:26.792
FOUR PEOPLE PUT HIM
AT THE BAR ALL NIGHT LONG.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.917
AND THERE'S SECURITY CAMERA
FOOTAGE OF HIM CLOSING OUT

21:29.917 --> 21:31.542
WHEN THE VIC WT DOWN.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.834
THE VIC'S NAME IS ELLEN,
AND HE WAS THERE.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.166
HE'S OUR GUY.

21:35.166 --> 21:37.041
THE TIME CODE
ON THE TAPE CHECKS OUT.

21:37.041 --> 21:38.750
I'M SORRY, LIEUTENANT.

21:47.250 --> 21:49.291
YOU WERE THERE
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.291
DID YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE
ON THE STREET?

21:51.291 --> 21:52.542
NO. IT WAS DEAD.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.208
NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY?

21:54.208 --> 21:57.041
THERE WAS SOME DOUCHE BAG
WITH HIS HIGH BEAMS ON.

21:57.041 --> 21:58.458
BLINDING ME.

21:58.458 --> 21:59.959
SO SOMEONE
WAS ON THE STREET.

21:59.959 --> 22:02.667
HE WAS COMING THE OTHER
DIRECTION WHEN I PULLED UP.

22:02.667 --> 22:07.125
ACTUALLY,
IT WASN'T HIGH BEAMS.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.750
IT WAS THOSE...
BIG ASS HALOGENS.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.208
WHAT KINDA CAR?

22:13.208 --> 22:14.667
SUV.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.583
DARK. BLUE.

22:17.583 --> 22:19.667
BLACK--
I-I-I DON'T KNOW!

22:19.667 --> 22:21.291
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

22:24.625 --> 22:27.208
I AM INDEED
A GOOD FRIEND TO HAVE.

22:32.083 --> 22:34.959
AND ONE CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MANY FRIENDS, RIGHT?

22:37.083 --> 22:39.375
MY FRIEND MIGUEL
ISN'T GIVING UP WITHOUT A FIGHT.

22:39.375 --> 22:43.667
HE'LL DO WHATEVER'S NECESSARY
TO REGAIN THE UPPER HAND.

22:43.667 --> 22:46.792
IF HE CONTROLS LAGUERTA,
HE CONTROLS THE INVESTIGATION,

22:46.792 --> 22:49.917
AND MY LEVERAGE DISAPPEARS.

22:49.917 --> 22:52.875
BUT SHE'S A TOUGH SELL.
HE WON'T GET FAR.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.750
I HOPE.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.583
(Rita)
TA-DA!

23:03.709 --> 23:05.875
YOU...

23:05.875 --> 23:07.375
ARE SO...

23:07.375 --> 23:08.834
BEAUTIFUL!

23:10.667 --> 23:11.875
OH...

23:11.875 --> 23:13.125
ALL RIGHT.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.375
NOW, YOU COME OVER HERE
AND ADMIRE YOURSELF

23:16.375 --> 23:18.667
WHILE NINA CHECKS THE FIT.

23:22.083 --> 23:23.625
I FEEL LIKE CINDERELLA.

23:23.625 --> 23:26.834
EXCEPT FOR THE WHOLE
DISNEY VIRGIN THING.

23:26.834 --> 23:28.834
OH, DON'T WORRY.

23:28.834 --> 23:31.375
NO ONE'LL KNOW PRINCE CHARMING
KNOCKED YA UP BEFORE THE BALL.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.125
[chuckles]

23:33.125 --> 23:35.166
HEY, SYL, ARE YOU OKAY?

23:35.166 --> 23:39.125
YEAH. I WAS JUST
REMEMBERING MY WEDDING DAY.

23:39.125 --> 23:41.333
I WAS NEVER HAPPIER.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.417
IT'S SUPPOSED TO GET
EVEN BETTER OVER TIME.

23:43.417 --> 23:45.792
SWEETIE, YOUR MARRIAGE
WILL, I'M SURE OF IT.

23:45.792 --> 23:48.750
THINGS STILL AREN'T
GREAT WITH MIGUEL?

23:48.750 --> 23:51.417
WELL, WE'RE WORKING
ON IT.

23:51.417 --> 23:53.542
AT LEAST I AM.

23:55.750 --> 23:56.792
AND WHAT'S HE DOING?

23:56.792 --> 23:58.542
WISH I KNEW.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.709
DO YOU...REALLY?

24:09.792 --> 24:12.000
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

24:12.000 --> 24:14.041
FORENSICS?

24:14.041 --> 24:16.250
ON WHICH CASE?

24:16.250 --> 24:19.625
THE NEW BEAN COUNTER
IS QUESTIONING THIS LAB REQUEST.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.333
WHAT IS THIS KEY
THAT YOU'RE TESTING?

24:21.333 --> 24:22.875
IT'S, UH...

24:22.875 --> 24:24.125
IT'S FOR AN INVESTIGATION.

24:24.125 --> 24:25.875
THEN PUT AN ACTIVE
CASE NUMBER ON IT, OKAY?

24:25.875 --> 24:27.291
WITH ALL THESE
BUDGET CUTS,

24:27.291 --> 24:29.792
THEY'RE FLAGGING EVERYTHING
AND COMING STRAIGHT TO ME

24:29.792 --> 24:31.792
WITH ALL THIS BULLSHIT

24:31.792 --> 24:33.333
WHICH I REALLY DON'T
NEED RIGHT NOW, DEXTER.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.500
I DON'T NEED IT.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.125
OKAY. I'LL STRAIGHTEN
IT OUT.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.625
I'M SORRY.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.250
I JUST--

24:44.250 --> 24:45.625
NO. I'LL TAKE CARE
OF IT.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.625
SHE'S RIPE FOR THE PICKING,
AND MIGUEL KNOWS IT.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.542
HE'LL USE HER
TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

24:53.542 --> 24:55.208
AND THERE GOES MY LEVERAGE.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.959
BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

24:56.959 --> 24:58.917
NO, NO, NO, NO.
Y-YOU CAN'T CANCEL.

24:58.917 --> 25:01.333
THE PARTY'S IN TWO DAYS.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.000
YOU'RE SORRY?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.500
[scoffs]

25:04.500 --> 25:08.959
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SORRY
AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!

25:08.959 --> 25:10.625
FUCK!

25:12.875 --> 25:14.500
THE EROTIC CLOWNS
JUST CANCELLED.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.291
WHY IS THIS WEDDING
HAPPENING TO ME?

25:18.333 --> 25:20.417
BRO, LET ME HELP YA
I'VE BEEN THE BEST MAN

25:20.417 --> 25:22.166
AT MORE WEDDINGS
THAN I C COUNT.

25:22.166 --> 25:23.417
NEVER A GROOM,
THANK CHRIST,

25:23.417 --> 25:25.083
BUT I'VE PLANNED
A TON OF THESE.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.417
"PLATINUM ENTERPRISES"?

25:27.417 --> 25:29.166
IT'S A FULL-SERVICE
OPERATION,

25:29.166 --> 25:31.291
PARTY BOAT, FOOD,
ALCOHOL.

25:31.291 --> 25:33.000
ONE PHONE CALL,
AND YOU'RE DONE.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.166
ASK FOR TAMMY.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.792
GOD BLESS YOU,
JOSEPH QUINN.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.709
HEY. HE LIVES.

25:45.709 --> 25:46.709
HEY, MAN.

25:46.709 --> 25:48.500
GOOD TO SEE YOU
UP AND MOVING, MAN.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.000
THANKS, THANKS, UM...
MORGAN, SHE HERE?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.208
AH, NO, SHE'S OUT.

25:53.208 --> 25:54.417
RUNNING DOWN A FILE

25:54.417 --> 25:56.875
ON THE BASTARD
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

25:56.875 --> 25:59.583
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM,
ANTON, I SWEAR.
YEAH, I KNOW.

25:59.583 --> 26:02.125
HEY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY

26:02.125 --> 26:04.166
I NEVER MEANT FOR ANY
OF THIS TO GO DOWN

26:04.166 --> 26:06.291
THE WAY IT DID, YOU KNOW?

26:06.291 --> 26:07.500
YOU DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR THIS.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.000
HEY, LISTEN, I WAS
THE IDIOT WHO GOT BUSTED

26:10.000 --> 26:12.125
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
RIGHT? SO...

26:12.125 --> 26:13.291
IT'S KIND OF ON ME.

26:13.291 --> 26:15.208
YEAH, BUT IT WAS ME THINKING
I WAS DOING YOU A FAVOR

26:15.208 --> 26:17.166
KEEPING YOU OFF THE BOOKS.

26:17.166 --> 26:20.125
SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
YOU WERE FREE AND CLEAR.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.625
I MESSED UP.

26:21.625 --> 26:23.709
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOUR FACE.

26:23.709 --> 26:27.709
[laughs]
DEB TOLD ME
THAT WAS A CLERICAL ERROR.

26:29.458 --> 26:30.458
THAT WAS YOU?

26:30.458 --> 26:32.583
YEAH. I ASSUMED
SHE TOLD YOU.

26:34.291 --> 26:35.542
YOU LYING SON OF A BITCH!

26:35.542 --> 26:37.500
YOU ALMOST GOT ME KILLED!

26:37.500 --> 26:38.417
SHIT!

26:38.417 --> 26:40.542
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET HIM GO.

26:40.542 --> 26:41.583
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

26:41.583 --> 26:42.792
RAMOS, LET HIM GO.
LET HIM GO!

26:45.250 --> 26:48.166
THIS SHIT AIN'T OVER, MAN.

26:48.166 --> 26:50.583
ANTON...

26:52.417 --> 26:53.792
YOU OKAY?

26:53.792 --> 26:54.583
YEAH.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.000
ANTON, STOP.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.417
GODDAMN IT,
WILL YOU JUST STOP?

27:01.417 --> 27:02.917
HIS PUNK ASS
DESERVED IT!

27:02.917 --> 27:05.500
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK INTO A
POLICE STATION AND PUNCH A COP!

27:05.500 --> 27:06.792
HERE YOU ARE STANDIN'
UP FOR HIM.

27:06.792 --> 27:10.041
I AM NOT THE ENEMY HERE.
DEBRA, YOU LIED TO ME!

27:10.041 --> 27:11.875
CLERICAL ERROR, MY ASS.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.083
QUINN KEPT ME

27:13.083 --> 27:14.458
AS HIS C.I. BITCH

27:14.458 --> 27:16.166
WHEN I COULD HAVE WALKED
AWAY AT ANY TIME.

27:16.166 --> 27:17.875
YOU'RE RIGHT, I LIED.

27:17.875 --> 27:20.500
BUT TELLING YOU WASN'T
GONNA CHANGE WHAT HE DID.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.667
I ALMOST DIED
BECAUSE OF THAT PRICK.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.875
WITHOUT THAT PRICK,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND YOU.

27:24.875 --> 27:27.542
YOU'RE LUCKY IF HE
DOESN'T PRESS CHARGES.

27:27.542 --> 27:29.041
WHAT? LET HIM!

27:29.041 --> 27:30.959
I'LL SUE THIS WHOLE
FUCKING DEPARTMENT!

27:30.959 --> 27:33.041
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

27:33.041 --> 27:34.792
I'LL TALK TO QUINN.

27:36.166 --> 27:37.250
REALLY.

27:39.375 --> 27:40.625
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID

27:40.625 --> 27:42.792
HE MIGHT FIND OUT
WE'RE SLEEPING TOGETHER

27:42.792 --> 27:44.000
AND TELL EVERYONE?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.917
HE ALREADY KNOWS,
AND HE HASN'T TOLD ANYONE.

27:45.917 --> 27:47.583
AND WHERE THE HELL
DID THAT COME FROM?

27:47.583 --> 27:49.250
FROM YOUR BROTHER'S
SURPRISED FACE

27:49.250 --> 27:51.834
WHEN HE MET ME, DEBRA.

27:51.834 --> 27:53.750
FROM YOUR BOOT ON MY BUTT

27:53.750 --> 27:55.208
KICKIN' ME OUT THE DOOR
THIS MORNING.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.834
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

27:56.834 --> 27:58.750
I AM THIS CLOSE
TO GETTING MY SHIELD,

27:58.750 --> 28:00.375
AND I'M PUTTING IT ALL
AT RISK TO BE WITH YOU!

28:00.375 --> 28:02.875
THEN DEBRA, WHY ARE YOU?

28:02.875 --> 28:04.709
YOU FEEL GUILTY?

28:06.667 --> 28:09.125
YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

28:14.625 --> 28:16.625
SHIT. YOU'RE BLEEDING.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.792
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
NEW STITCHES.

28:21.792 --> 28:23.792
DEBRA, I TELL YOU
WHAT I'M GONNA NEED.

28:26.625 --> 28:30.125
I NEED FOR YOU
TO SERIOUSLY...

28:30.125 --> 28:31.500
THINK ABOUT THIS.

28:31.500 --> 28:34.667
THINK ABOUT US.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.709
NO, NO, PARA MI, NO.

28:46.709 --> 28:48.709
I THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

28:48.709 --> 28:51.917
WINE...INVENTED
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE

28:51.917 --> 28:54.959
OF HANDLING GRIEF.

28:54.959 --> 28:56.375
HMM?

28:56.375 --> 28:59.166
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

28:59.166 --> 29:02.208
WHEN OSCAR DIED,
I DROWNED MY SHARE OF SORROW.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.542
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
YOU MISS HER.

29:08.542 --> 29:11.208
JUST...JUST...

29:11.208 --> 29:14.792
LAST THURSDAY, I WAS
HAVING DRINKS WITH HER.

29:14.792 --> 29:17.417
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY,

29:17.417 --> 29:20.709
I'M STARING DOWN
AT HER DEAD BODY.

29:23.166 --> 29:24.542
IF YOU'RE GONNA END UP
IN A GRAVE,

29:24.542 --> 29:26.208
IT SHOULD AT LEAST
BE YOUR OWN.

29:26.208 --> 29:28.041
AND SO THE ONLY THING
YOU GOT TO GO ON RIGHT NOW

29:28.041 --> 29:29.417
IS THAT SUV, HUH?

29:29.417 --> 29:30.667
WE'RE CHECKING EVERY

29:30.667 --> 29:32.125
INTERSECTION
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA

29:32.125 --> 29:34.917
FROM ELLEN'S PLACE
TO THE CEMETERY.

29:34.917 --> 29:36.458
GOOD. GOOD.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.709
THOROUGH.

29:43.417 --> 29:46.250
SEE, SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU
WATCHIN' OUT FOR HER.

29:46.250 --> 29:50.667
IT'S JUST LIKE YOU WATCHED OUT
FOR ME WITH OSCAR'S CASE.

29:50.667 --> 29:53.041
SOME GOOD THAT DID.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.291
HEY, MARIA, COME ON.

29:56.291 --> 29:58.000
YOU HELPED ME.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.583
YOU HELPED ME.

30:02.875 --> 30:04.458
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
IMPORTANT TO ME.

30:04.458 --> 30:05.917
YOU KNOW THAT.

30:08.917 --> 30:11.125
YOU REMEMBER THAT WEEKEND
WHEN WE TOOK OSCAR WITH US

30:11.125 --> 30:12.959
TO THE KEYS?

30:12.959 --> 30:15.542
I KEPT TELLING HIM,
"I AM NOT SHARING...

30:15.542 --> 30:19.000
THE HOTTEST GIRL IN FLORIDA
WITH MY BABY BROTHER."

30:19.000 --> 30:21.750
AND THEN YOU TALKED ME
INTO LETTING HIM COME.

30:21.750 --> 30:23.667
HE WAS SO CUTE.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.625
THOSE SKINNY LITTLE
LEGS.
MM-HMM.

30:27.625 --> 30:28.959
UP UNTIL THAT WEEKEND,

30:28.959 --> 30:31.291
HE WAS ALWAYS MY ANNOYING
KID BROTHER, YOU KNOW?

30:31.291 --> 30:33.417
ALWAYS IN THE WAY.

30:33.417 --> 30:36.000
AND THEN WHEN
HE WAS TAKEN FROM ME,

30:36.000 --> 30:39.792
I KEPT ON THINKING BACK
TO THAT WEEKEND...YOU KNOW?

30:39.792 --> 30:41.709
'CAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
I WANNA REMEMBER HIM,

30:41.709 --> 30:43.583
LIKE YOU SAID.

30:43.583 --> 30:46.166
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE ALL THE DRUGS

30:46.166 --> 30:49.125
AND ALL THE RUN-INS
WITH THE COPS AND ALL THAT.

30:50.709 --> 30:53.041
THAT LITTLE BOY
WITH THE SKINNY LEGS,

30:53.041 --> 30:55.208
MY BROTHER.

30:57.834 --> 30:59.166
[whispers]
SORRY.

31:03.875 --> 31:06.166
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THAT
MEMORY IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

31:08.291 --> 31:09.458
SERIOUSLY.

31:11.166 --> 31:12.000
THANK YOU.

31:13.333 --> 31:14.291
GRACIAS.

31:39.333 --> 31:41.750
I MISS THAT.

31:45.875 --> 31:50.917
[knocking]

31:50.917 --> 31:53.458
OH, MAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.834
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

32:02.417 --> 32:04.041
HEY, LIEUTENANT,

32:04.041 --> 32:05.917
I AM SORRY
TO SHOW UP UNANNOUNCED.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.041
I KNOW IT'S LATE,

32:07.041 --> 32:08.458
BUT I FEEL SO BAD ABOUT
THAT CASE NUMBER SCREW UP,

32:08.458 --> 32:10.250
AND I JUST WANTED TO--

32:10.250 --> 32:11.291
MIGUEL.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.875
I'M INTERRUPTING--
NO, WE'RE JUST, UM...

32:14.875 --> 32:16.875
CASEWORK.
TALKING CASEWORK.

32:16.875 --> 32:18.166
OH.

32:18.166 --> 32:20.583
IF THIS WAS SO URGENT, DEXTER,
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED ME.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.583
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.
IT'S JUST...

32:22.583 --> 32:24.500
I FEEL BAD,
AND THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.750
THE KEY I TESTED
CAME FROM A COLLEAGUE

32:27.750 --> 32:29.083
IN MONROE COUNTY.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.750
HIS DEPARTMENT
DOESN'T HAVE OUR RESOURCES,

32:30.750 --> 32:33.333
AND I DID HIM A FAVOR.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.834
I'M SORRY. I KNOW
HOW YOU VALUE THE TRUTH.

32:35.834 --> 32:38.583
LOOK, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

32:38.583 --> 32:39.875
JUST LET ME KNOW
NEXT TIME.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.458
OKAY.

32:41.458 --> 32:42.959
AND CALL FIRST.

32:42.959 --> 32:46.166
AGAIN, I'M...
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

32:56.959 --> 33:00.834
I COULDN'T LET LAGUERTA BECOME
MIGUEL'S COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

33:00.834 --> 33:03.125
I NEED TO KEEP
HIS FOCUS ON ME.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.291
AFTER TONIGHT,
I HAVE HIS FULL ATTENTION.

33:10.834 --> 33:12.250
HEY, THERE.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.125
PLEASE DON'T HATE ME,

33:14.125 --> 33:17.125
BUT I-I MAY HAVE DONE
A BAD THING.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.792
DO I NEED TO SIT DOWN?

33:18.792 --> 33:21.625
I TOLD SYLVIA
ABOUT MIGUEL AND LAGUERTA.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.375
I'M GONNA SIT DOWN.

33:23.375 --> 33:24.959
I WAS TRYING ON MY DRESS.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.417
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE WEDDING.

33:26.417 --> 33:27.667
SHE SEEMED SO SAD.

33:27.667 --> 33:28.959
I MEAN, I HAD TO SAY
SOMETHING, DIDN'T I?

33:28.959 --> 33:31.125
I SUPPOSE YOU DID.

33:31.125 --> 33:33.166
SO SHE CALLED MIGUEL'S OFFICE,
AND HIS ASSISTANT SAID

33:33.166 --> 33:35.834
THAT HE WAS MEETING
WITH LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA,

33:35.834 --> 33:37.291
BUT THEN SYL CHECKED
WITH YOUR PRECINCT,

33:37.291 --> 33:38.500
AND NEITHER OF THEM
IS THERE.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.542
SO...SHE THINKS MIGUEL
IS AT LAGUERTA'S?

33:40.542 --> 33:43.542
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'S GONNA DO?

33:52.750 --> 33:54.583
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW,
HMM?

33:54.583 --> 33:56.166
ABOUT THE CASE?

33:56.166 --> 33:58.166
SURE. AT THE OFFICE.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.709
MARIA...

33:59.709 --> 34:02.166
(Sylvia)
YOU FUCKER!

34:02.166 --> 34:05.792
YOU ARE TOO GOOD
A LIAR, MIGUEL.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.166
SYL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

34:07.166 --> 34:08.917
I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE
TELLING THE TRUTH ANYMORE.

34:08.917 --> 34:10.542
YOU SAY YOU'RE AT WORK.
I BELIEVE YOU.

34:10.542 --> 34:12.208
YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

34:12.208 --> 34:15.125
I BELIEVE YOU.
SYL, NOTHING HAPPENED
HERE, OKAY?

34:15.125 --> 34:17.250
I SWEAR TO YOU.
YOU SWORE TO ME
LAST THURSDAY...

34:17.250 --> 34:18.667
WHEN YOU WERE OUT
ALL NIGHT.

34:18.667 --> 34:21.709
YOU SWORE TO ME YOU WEREN'T
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

34:21.709 --> 34:24.041
BUT NOW I THINK
YOU WERE HERE.

34:24.041 --> 34:27.000
WAIT. LAST THURSDAY,
HE WAS NOT--
YOU...

34:29.625 --> 34:31.583
YOU'LL PROBABLY BE
A LOT BETTER

34:31.583 --> 34:33.750
AT SEEING THROUGH
HIS BULLSHIT THAN I WAS,

34:33.750 --> 34:34.917
BEING A DETECTIVE AND ALL.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.542
GOOD LUCK.
SYL, COME ON,  VEN.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.083
DON'T TOUCH ME.
I'M DONE!

34:40.417 --> 34:41.709
SYL.

34:41.709 --> 34:43.291
GET OUT OF MY LIFE!

34:43.291 --> 34:44.834
[car door closes]

34:44.834 --> 34:46.875
[engine starts]

34:59.500 --> 35:01.542
SHE--SHE'S GOT IT ALL WRONG.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.083
I'LL STRAIGHTEN IT OUT.
ALL RIGHT?

35:07.792 --> 35:10.709
[car door closes,
engine starts]

35:31.417 --> 35:33.166
HEY, FRANCISCO!

35:33.166 --> 35:34.667
WHAT'LL IT BE
TODAY, MR. MORGAN?

35:34.667 --> 35:36.792
[speaking Spanish]

35:38.583 --> 35:40.333
I SAID YOU'D TAKE
THE USUAL.

35:43.458 --> 35:47.000
YOU'RE A CREATURE...
OF HABIT.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.166
COME ON, TAKE A SEAT.
WHILE YOU WAIT.

35:58.834 --> 36:02.291
KIND OF A BITCH MOVE
THERE, MAN.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.125
SENDING MY WIFE
OVER TO MARIA'S.

36:04.125 --> 36:06.542
SURPRISINGLY,
IT WASN'T ME.

36:06.542 --> 36:07.834
SURE.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.667
YOU WOULDN'T PLAY GAMES
WITH A MAN'S FAMILY,

36:10.667 --> 36:12.709
OR, UH...

36:12.709 --> 36:14.875
CAUSE PAIN
TO AN INNOCENT WOMAN.

36:18.250 --> 36:19.709
NEITHER WOULD I.

36:19.709 --> 36:21.792
THAT'S WHY I WANTED
TO GIVE YOU A HEADS UP

36:21.792 --> 36:23.041
THAT MY OFFICE
IS THINKING ABOUT DOING

36:23.041 --> 36:25.500
A LITTLE ETHICS PROBE
ON YOUR SISTER.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.917
[snickers]

36:26.917 --> 36:28.583
COPS DON'T COME
ANY CLEANER THAN DEB.

36:28.583 --> 36:30.000
YEAH, HUH?

36:30.000 --> 36:31.917
LIKE, UH, SLEEPING
WITH A C.I.?

36:31.917 --> 36:34.667
'CAUSE IT'S ALL HERE
IN THIS SURVEILLANCE REPORT

36:34.667 --> 36:36.333
FOR WHAT'S-HIS-NAME.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.583
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

36:37.583 --> 36:40.500
"ANTON BRIGGS."

36:40.500 --> 36:44.625
NOW, MI'JITO,
THIS DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

36:44.625 --> 36:46.542
PERO...

36:46.542 --> 36:49.166
I'M GONNA KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON IT...

36:49.166 --> 36:50.834
JUST LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA KEEP A CLOSE EYE

36:50.834 --> 36:53.959
ON ELLEN'S CASE FOR ME.

36:53.959 --> 36:56.208
AND ANY OTHER FAVOR
I MIGHT HAVE.

36:56.208 --> 36:58.500
THE USUAL, MR. MORGAN.

37:01.291 --> 37:02.834
HERE.

37:04.709 --> 37:06.542
IT'S A COPY.

37:06.542 --> 37:08.333
'CAUSE AFTER ALL...

37:08.333 --> 37:11.166
FAMILIA  IS SACRED.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.333
RIGHT?

37:15.375 --> 37:18.375
HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT DOOR JUST OPENED.

37:18.375 --> 37:20.208
[door opens]

37:20.208 --> 37:21.375
MR. DEXTER.

37:21.375 --> 37:22.792
HEY, NORMA.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.875
THE PRADOS,
THEY'RE NOT HOME.

37:24.875 --> 37:26.208
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS HOPING.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.542
DID YOU KNOW THAT MIGUEL

37:27.542 --> 37:29.375
IS GONNA BE BEST MAN
FOR MY WEDDING?

37:29.375 --> 37:32.333
YEAH. I HEARD HIM TALKING
ABOUT IT WITH MRS. SYLVIA.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.625
WELL, THE GROOM IS SUPPOSED
TO BUY HIS BEST MAN A GIFT.

37:34.625 --> 37:37.458
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH MIGUEL
LOVES GARCIA MARQUEZ,

37:37.458 --> 37:38.625
SO I THOUGHT I'D PICK UP

37:38.625 --> 37:40.709
A LIMITED EDITION
OF ONE OF HIS BOOKS.

37:40.709 --> 37:42.417
HE WOULD LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH.

37:42.417 --> 37:45.291
DO YOU THINK IT'D BE ALL RIGHT
IF I LOOKED IN MIGUEL'S DEN

37:45.291 --> 37:47.583
JUST TO SEE WHAT
HE ALREADY HAS?

37:47.583 --> 37:49.834
OUR SECRET?

37:49.834 --> 37:51.208
OKAY.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.625
COME IN.

37:55.959 --> 37:57.917
I'LL BE OUT IN A JIFFY.

37:57.917 --> 37:59.208
(Norma)
OKAY.

38:12.458 --> 38:15.458
MIGUEL STEPPED OVER A LINE,
AND HE'LL KEEP STEPPING

38:15.458 --> 38:17.959
UNTIL I HAVE SOMETHING
HE CAN'T TOP,

38:17.959 --> 38:19.625
SOMETHING THAT COULD
PUT HIM IN JAIL,

38:19.625 --> 38:21.667
IF AND WHEN I WANT HIM THERE.

38:27.750 --> 38:30.583
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
HE'LL BACK OFF.

38:30.583 --> 38:34.166
I KNOW MIGUEL
KILLED ELLEN WOLF.

38:34.166 --> 38:37.250
AND I KNOW HE TOOK
ONE OF HER RINGS AS A TROPHY.

38:39.208 --> 38:41.583
THE QUESTION IS,
WHERE DID HE HIDE IT?

38:49.250 --> 38:52.125
SOMEWHERE NO ONE ELSE
WOULD EVER LOOK.

39:01.750 --> 39:03.458
UNLESS...

39:05.500 --> 39:07.458
UNLESS THEY'RE ME.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.792
NO MORE GAMES.

39:33.875 --> 39:36.083
HI.
ARE YOU VINCE?

39:36.083 --> 39:37.750
[warily]
YEAH...

39:37.750 --> 39:40.542
I'M TAMMY OKAMA.
PLATINUM ENTERPRISES.

39:40.542 --> 39:41.667
MAY I SIT?

39:41.667 --> 39:42.750
YEAH, SURE.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.208
YOU'RE TAMMY?

39:47.208 --> 39:48.166
MM-HMM.

39:48.166 --> 39:50.875
I WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE...

39:50.875 --> 39:52.750
TRASHY?
YEAH.

39:52.750 --> 39:54.583
THAT'S SWEET.

39:54.583 --> 39:57.250
SO! WE ARE PLANNING
A BACHELOR PARTY.

39:57.250 --> 39:58.834
YEAH, BUT, UH,
KEEP IT DOWN,

39:58.834 --> 40:00.792
BECAUSE PARTY BOY'S
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

40:00.792 --> 40:02.583
[softer]
OH! WELL...

40:02.583 --> 40:06.709
WE HAVE ANY NUMBER OF
THEMES YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM.

40:06.709 --> 40:08.709
WELL, UH...

40:08.709 --> 40:10.208
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE?

40:10.208 --> 40:12.917
MM. I'D STICK
WITH A NAUTICAL THEME.

40:12.917 --> 40:15.208
RIVERBOAT CASINO.
PIRATES IN PETTICOATS.

40:15.208 --> 40:16.875
NAUTICAL'S GOOD.

40:16.875 --> 40:20.542
MM-HMM. YOU HAVE
SUCH NICE EYES, VINCE.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.625
[giggling]

40:25.625 --> 40:27.291
[giggling]

40:27.291 --> 40:29.291
[knocking]

40:29.291 --> 40:31.333
HEY, DEX, I GOT
YOUR MESSAGE.

40:31.333 --> 40:33.083
DID YOU GET A DNA
MATCH ON THAT KEY?

40:33.083 --> 40:35.291
UH, SEEMS SO.

40:35.291 --> 40:37.083
THANK YOU.

40:37.083 --> 40:38.750
I MEAN IT.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.208
SO WHERE'S THE REPORT?

40:45.959 --> 40:48.917
IF ANGEL WANTS TO KILL THIS GUY,
THAT'S HIS BUSINESS.

40:48.917 --> 40:50.291
I'M DONE GETTING INVOLVED
WITH FRIENDS.

40:50.291 --> 40:52.959
I HEARD, UH, LAGUERTA
GAVE YOU SHIT FOR THIS.

40:52.959 --> 40:54.417
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

40:54.417 --> 40:56.166
BUT I-I KNEW THAT
I COULD TRUST YOU.

40:56.166 --> 40:57.542
[thinking]
DON'T GET INVOLVED.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.125
I HEARD ABOUT
DETECTIVE GIANNA.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.291
HOW IS SHE?

41:02.291 --> 41:04.417
[thinking]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:04.417 --> 41:06.250
OKAY. NO CONCUSSION.

41:07.792 --> 41:09.667
DEX, THE--THE FILE.

41:09.667 --> 41:10.792
YEP.

41:13.709 --> 41:15.792
I KNOW HOW HARD
IT MT HAVE BEEN

41:15.792 --> 41:17.041
TO SEE HER LIKE THAT.

41:17.041 --> 41:20.083
I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO...

41:20.083 --> 41:22.917
WANNA REBALANCE
AN UNBALANCED WORLD.

41:22.917 --> 41:24.959
BUT IT'S JUST...

41:24.959 --> 41:27.875
UNBALANCED, ANGEL,
AND THAT'S IT.

41:27.875 --> 41:29.458
OKAY.

41:29.458 --> 41:30.333
OKAY.

41:30.333 --> 41:33.208
SOME DOORS
SHOULD STAY SHUT.

41:33.208 --> 41:38.458
YOU OPEN IT, IT'S TOO EASY TO
WALK THROUGH IT A SECOND TIME.

41:38.458 --> 41:41.417
I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.
RECENTLY, EVEN.

41:47.542 --> 41:49.125
I'LL KEEP IT IN MIND.

41:51.667 --> 41:53.667
THANKS, DEX.

41:57.458 --> 41:58.667
WELL, AT LEAST
I DIDN'T TEACH HIM

41:58.667 --> 42:00.083
HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

42:00.083 --> 42:01.667
I'M LEARNING.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.125
THOUGHT YOU SAID

42:13.125 --> 42:15.458
YOU'D BE GONE
BY THE TIME I GOT BACK.

42:15.458 --> 42:19.000
I'M JUST GETTING
SOME WORK STUFF HERE.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.458
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU GET EVERYTHING.

42:21.458 --> 42:23.917
I DON'T WANT YOU USING IT
AS AN EXCUSE TO COME BACK.

42:23.917 --> 42:25.875
SYL, LOOK, I--

42:25.875 --> 42:27.959
JEEZ.

42:27.959 --> 42:29.166
DAMN IT!

43:07.083 --> 43:08.709
PLEASE, SIR,

43:08.709 --> 43:11.125
THIS STAIN JUST
WOULDN'T COME OUT.

43:11.125 --> 43:14.250
YOU KNOW, ONCE BLOOD SETS,
IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET OUT,

43:14.250 --> 43:15.458
SO NO CHARGE.

43:36.458 --> 43:39.041
DEVON PARKS?

43:47.917 --> 43:49.959
HEY, DEB,

43:49.959 --> 43:53.041
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE THING YOU GOT GOING

43:53.041 --> 43:55.000
WITH YOUR C.I.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.625
WELL, HE'S NOT A C.I.

43:56.625 --> 43:58.834
AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
GOING, NOT ANYMORE.

43:58.834 --> 44:00.542
WELL,
THAT SETTLES THAT.

44:00.542 --> 44:02.458
ONLY A RETARD WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH ANTON

44:02.458 --> 44:03.834
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

44:03.834 --> 44:04.750
I DON'T KNOW.

44:04.750 --> 44:06.667
HE SEEMED LIKE
A NICE ENOUGH GUY.

44:06.667 --> 44:09.166
YOU SEEMED TO LIKE HIM.

44:09.166 --> 44:12.667
WHEN HE WENT MISSING,
ALL I COULD THINK WAS,

44:12.667 --> 44:14.333
"PLEASE, GOD,
DON'T LET HIM BE DEAD."

44:14.333 --> 44:16.458
AND THEN I GET HIM BACK,

44:16.458 --> 44:18.792
AND ALL I CAN THINK IS...

44:18.792 --> 44:21.250
HOW WRONG HE IS FOR ME.

44:21.250 --> 44:24.959
YOU KNOW, LIKE...
HOW BAD IT MAKES ME LOOK.

44:24.959 --> 44:27.125
DOESN'T MATTER
THAT HE MAKES ME HAPPY

44:27.125 --> 44:29.500
OR HE MAKES ME FEEL
HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL

44:29.500 --> 44:31.625
WHEN YOU'RE WITH
THE RIGHT PERSON.

44:31.625 --> 44:34.291
IS THAT CRAZY?

44:37.500 --> 44:39.083
I GOT NOTHIN'.

44:39.083 --> 44:40.291
[laughs]

44:42.458 --> 44:43.542
GOD.

44:43.542 --> 44:46.500
YOU ARE USELESS.
[laughing]

44:48.000 --> 44:50.125
LOVE YOU ANYWAY.

45:20.333 --> 45:22.083
THINK THIS IS FUNNY?

45:22.083 --> 45:23.041
NOT AT ALL.

45:23.041 --> 45:24.583
THEY SAID THAT STAIN
WOULD COME OUT!

45:24.583 --> 45:26.500
FUCK YOU!

45:26.500 --> 45:27.875
I DIDN'T GET TO WHERE I AM,

45:27.875 --> 45:30.333
WHO I AM BY LETTING
SOME LITTLE GUSANO  LIKE YOU

45:30.333 --> 45:32.041
WALK ALL OVER ME!

45:32.041 --> 45:34.875
WHERE'S MY RING?
IT'S NOT YOUR RING.
IT'S ELLEN'S.

45:34.875 --> 45:37.375
BUT YOU DID LEAVE
A NICE, CLEAN PRINT ON IT.

45:37.375 --> 45:40.166
OH, THERE'S PLENTY
OF BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS TOO!

45:40.166 --> 45:42.417
ETHAN TURNER,
CLEMSON GALT.

45:42.417 --> 45:44.375
ALL DESERVING...

45:44.375 --> 45:46.041
WITH NOTHING TO TIE ME
TO THEIR DEATHS

45:46.041 --> 45:48.750
AND NO BODIES TO PROVE
THAT THEY'RE EVEN DEAD.

45:48.750 --> 45:50.291
MAYBE IN A COURT OF LAW.

45:50.291 --> 45:52.458
BUT HOW'S THAT LITTLE
BRIDE OF YOURS GONNA FEEL

45:52.458 --> 45:54.500
WHEN SHE HAS TO START
ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS?

45:54.500 --> 45:55.792
'CAUSE SHE'S GOTTA
WONDER WHERE YOU GO,

45:55.792 --> 45:59.000
WHAT YOU DO, WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.417
SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING
SHE NEEDS TO,

46:00.417 --> 46:02.208
AND IT'S GONNA STAY THAT WAY

46:02.208 --> 46:05.083
OR THAT RING MIGHT SHOW UP
SOMEPLACE VERY INCONVENIENT.

46:05.083 --> 46:07.417
I AM THE LAST PERSON
YOU WANNA FUCK WITH,

46:07.417 --> 46:09.667
BECAUSE I WILL FUCK YOU BACK

46:09.667 --> 46:12.542
IN WAYS YOU NEVER
EVEN IMAGINED!

46:13.750 --> 46:17.792
AN ANONYMOUS TIP,
COUPLE OF SEARCH WARRANTS.

46:17.792 --> 46:20.750
HMM? WHO KNOWS WHAT THE POLICE
MIGHT FIND IN YOUR APARTMENT

46:20.750 --> 46:22.250
OR IN THAT LITTLE
BOAT OF YOURS.

46:22.250 --> 46:23.583
YOU GOT THE RING.

46:23.583 --> 46:26.792
[spits]
I GOT CITY FUCKING HALL!

46:26.792 --> 46:29.000
WOW. I DIDN'T GET IT
BEFORE, MIGUEL,

46:29.000 --> 46:32.500
BUT YOU CAN'T BE REASONED WITH,
GUILTED, CONTROLLED.

46:32.500 --> 46:35.291
THIS WHOLE BACK AND FORTH
GAME FOR LEVERAGE IS POINTLESS.

46:35.291 --> 46:36.583
THAT'S RIGHT!

46:36.583 --> 46:38.625
I'LL DO WHAT I WANT
WHEN I WANT

46:38.625 --> 46:41.166
TO WHOMEVER I WANT--
COUNT ON IT!

46:42.291 --> 46:43.959
I WILL.

46:51.125 --> 46:52.834
THANK YOU.

47:05.625 --> 47:08.917
HARRY WAS RIGHT.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT.

47:08.917 --> 47:12.291
THERE ARE THE INNOCENT,
AND THERE ARE THE DESERVING.

47:12.291 --> 47:14.667
HAVE BARBARA GIANNA
I.D. THIS GUY.

47:14.667 --> 47:17.792
SOME DOORS
SHOULD STAY CLOSED.

47:18.750 --> 47:21.000
SOME PEOPLE
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

47:23.166 --> 47:25.959
HARRY ALSO SAID
IT'S ALL ABOUT CHOICES.

47:28.291 --> 47:30.125
GOOD AND BAD.

47:42.166 --> 47:45.625
MY SEARCH FOR CONNECTION
ALWAYS ENDS IN BLOOD.

47:45.625 --> 47:48.375
[cell phone ringing]

47:51.166 --> 47:53.333
YOU GET A GOOD LOOK
AT HIM?

47:53.333 --> 47:55.709
(man)
YES.

47:55.709 --> 47:58.291
HOW DO I KNOW
THIS IS NOT A TRAP?

47:58.291 --> 48:00.583
OYE.  IF I WANTED YOU
IN JAIL,

48:00.583 --> 48:04.083
I WOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU LOOSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE, OKAY?

48:04.083 --> 48:07.709
AND YOU BELIEVE THIS MAN
KNOWS WHERE FREEBO IS?

48:07.709 --> 48:09.875
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO DOES.

48:09.875 --> 48:14.041
HIS NAME?

48:14.041 --> 48:16.041
(Miguel)
DEXTER MORGAN.

48:16.041 --> 48:17.834
YOU WANT FREEBO,

48:17.834 --> 48:19.834
YOU WANT YOUR MONEY...

48:23.000 --> 48:25.583
THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE
A LONG CONVERSATION

48:25.583 --> 48:26.875
WITH HIM.

48:28.959 --> 48:32.250
EVEN HARRY WOULD AGREE MIGUEL
HAS LEFT ME NO OTHER CHOICE.

48:32.250 --> 48:36.875
AS CHALLENGING AS IT WILL BE,
IT'S BACK TO OPTION ONE.

48:36.875 --> 48:38.667
I KILL HIM.
