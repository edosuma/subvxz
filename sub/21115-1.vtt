03:18.881 --> 03:23.281
Arne, are you sleeping? Arne?

03:39.001 --> 03:40.401
Arne.

04:44.801 --> 04:46.321
Hey, man. How are you?

04:46.441 --> 04:49.241
- This is everything?
- Yes.

04:54.321 --> 04:58.921
People think these holes were all formed
after the last ice age.

04:59.041 --> 05:04.241
The ice melted and left these holes
behind.

05:04.361 --> 05:07.881
But what if they are craters?

05:07.961 --> 05:09.881
Meteor craters?

05:13.481 --> 05:16.241
On the moon and on Mars
it's so obvious.

05:16.361 --> 05:18.601
Because the craters remain visible.

05:18.721 --> 05:23.761
But on earth, they very quickly disappear.

05:23.881 --> 05:27.441
So I think they're very underestimated.

05:27.561 --> 05:31.841
You know how many known craters
there are in the world?

05:31.961 --> 05:36.601
- One hundred and seventy six. I know.
- That's not so many.

05:36.721 --> 05:40.081
It's a very small chance.
But the impact would be...

05:40.201 --> 05:43.361
These holes are not necessarily
shaped by the ice.

05:43.481 --> 05:47.641
Most of them are perfectly round,
just like on the moon.

05:47.761 --> 05:49.401
Think about it.

05:49.561 --> 05:51.441
What if I'm right?

05:51.561 --> 05:55.641
- Wouldn't it be...
- Yeah, it would make you famous.

06:22.801 --> 06:25.521
So do you have photographs?

06:26.641 --> 06:28.121
Aerials?

06:28.241 --> 06:31.481
- No. Do you have?
- No.

06:33.801 --> 06:35.801
But I don't need them.

06:39.601 --> 06:41.961
I'm not looking for craters.

06:52.841 --> 06:56.681
They were supposed to be ready for me
at the university in Oslo.

06:56.801 --> 07:00.441
And I went there. But they were gone.

07:05.721 --> 07:08.441
Well, you never know... I mean...

07:08.561 --> 07:12.721
Some of those places have never been
visited by anyone. So...

07:41.521 --> 07:43.841
His compass.

07:45.441 --> 07:47.521
I can't believe she kept it.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.841
Is that a real Krantz?

07:55.961 --> 07:59.081
Yeah. My mother... She...

07:59.201 --> 08:02.201
She's probably afraid I get lost.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.281
It's very sweet.

08:12.601 --> 08:16.041
Yeah, it's... Yeah, very sweet.

10:50.481 --> 10:53.081
This is Alfred.

10:56.601 --> 11:00.921
- Per Aage Qvigstad.
- Johan Mikkelsen.

11:01.041 --> 11:05.481
So you met some of our flying friends
already?

11:07.481 --> 11:09.361
Welcome to Norway.

11:22.321 --> 11:24.441
Did you get some breakfast?

11:24.561 --> 11:29.921
I had some crackers. Shall I get my stuff?

12:28.041 --> 12:33.441
Two, four, six, eight...

13:53.161 --> 13:59.961
Thirty-eight. Thirty-nine. Forty.

14:07.801 --> 14:15.641
One step is 60 cm.
That's 1.2 km per hour.

14:15.761 --> 14:18.241
Or is it 2.4?

14:18.361 --> 14:21.801
That's per minute.

14:21.921 --> 14:25.241
So per hour that makes 2.4.

14:29.441 --> 14:32.081
2.4 kilometers.

15:43.081 --> 15:46.561
You know, worms...

15:46.681 --> 15:50.081
They enjoy the corpse of a hyena
just as much...

15:50.201 --> 15:54.641
as a bird of paradise. Have you thought
about that? Mikkelsen has not.

15:54.761 --> 15:57.361
He just pushes it aside, all those things.

16:55.401 --> 17:00.281
There is another Dutch guy
working on the same thing.

17:00.401 --> 17:01.961
- Right?
- What do you mean?

17:02.081 --> 17:04.080
No. Just me.

17:05.881 --> 17:08.840
As far as I know,
my father was the first one.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.840
The only one.

17:12.681 --> 17:15.840
- So he's a geologist?
- He was.

17:15.961 --> 17:21.080
He's...
He died when I was very young.

17:21.201 --> 17:23.161
Seven years old.

17:26.681 --> 17:28.481
He had an accident.

17:28.601 --> 17:31.641
He was doing research in Switzerland.

17:31.761 --> 17:35.561
And he fell into this big...

17:35.681 --> 17:39.041
How do you call it? Crevice.

17:40.881 --> 17:42.281
You know him?

17:42.401 --> 17:45.081
Did you talk to Nummedal about that?

17:45.201 --> 17:46.881
About my father?

17:46.961 --> 17:49.841
No. Not really.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.961
I don't think Nummedal approved much...

17:55.081 --> 17:56.681
of your father's work.

17:56.801 --> 18:01.081
So then I maybe thought
he would have mentioned it.

18:01.201 --> 18:04.241
No, but...

18:04.361 --> 18:06.401
He used to make jokes.

18:06.521 --> 18:10.361
That someone
who'd come from a swamp, Holland...

18:10.481 --> 18:13.601
would try to teach him something.

18:13.721 --> 18:16.281
Really? Oh, my god.

18:16.401 --> 18:19.041
Yeah, silly stuff.

18:19.161 --> 18:22.921
But I mean, he's an old man
and you shouldn't care.

18:23.041 --> 18:28.961
Yes, he is. A very strange man.

19:48.401 --> 19:51.721
One little stone is enough.

19:51.841 --> 19:54.441
Here.

20:13.161 --> 20:15.641
- How are you?
- Good.

20:22.201 --> 20:24.361
Needs to be a bit tighter
when you go down-hill.

20:24.481 --> 20:27.801
You don't...? You just...?

20:31.121 --> 20:36.721
So what's your research about?

20:36.841 --> 20:38.961
My research?

20:39.081 --> 20:44.081
- The movement of the continental plates.
- Really? The plates.

20:45.521 --> 20:47.561
Very interesting.

20:47.681 --> 20:52.921
I read that the current thinking
is way different from a few years back.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.481
Isn't that true?

20:54.601 --> 21:01.161
That they're trying to locate
the fault lines way inland...

21:01.281 --> 21:06.121
because the plates
are moving all the time, right?

21:06.241 --> 21:09.841
They're going back and forth all the time.
Isn't that true?

21:09.961 --> 21:13.441
So you work alone, or...?

21:13.561 --> 21:17.961
No, it's two South-Africans and one Swiss
in Greenland at the moment.

21:18.081 --> 21:21.281
I'm taking care of the Norwegian part.

21:22.521 --> 21:26.161
Yeah? And Mikkelsen?
What is he doing?

21:26.281 --> 21:31.161
Mikkelsen?
He's searching for the beginning.

22:44.481 --> 22:48.601
It is no wonder that the founders
of the great religions...

22:48.721 --> 22:54.321
- usually were fishermen.
- Oh, I'm just...

22:54.441 --> 22:56.041
What do you mean?

22:56.161 --> 23:00.281
You know, what takes place below
the surface, we do not know that.

23:00.401 --> 23:04.961
But fishermen,
they search for its secrets, right?

23:05.081 --> 23:06.881
And water reflects the sky.

23:06.961 --> 23:09.281
So, you know...

23:09.401 --> 23:14.081
I guess it made the waters
the most powerful symbol...

23:14.201 --> 23:17.961
of afterlife.

23:20.361 --> 23:22.761
Afterlife?

23:22.881 --> 23:26.481
That's why all the great prophets
were fishermen.

23:26.601 --> 23:29.961
And that's why they all died. They
drowned.

23:31.761 --> 23:35.481
You know,
Mikkelsen believes in a Great Creator.

23:35.601 --> 23:39.641
Nobody can deny it's possible, a Creator.

23:48.441 --> 23:52.681
You know, if this God of yours exists...

23:52.801 --> 23:56.761
don't you realise how terrible that idea
is?

23:56.881 --> 24:01.841
He's quite happy to have a generation
almost wiped out by a disease...

24:01.961 --> 24:06.881
only to have someone
in the next generation find a cure for it.

24:06.961 --> 24:08.761
Ether. You know ether?

24:08.881 --> 24:11.241
It was around for 300 years...

24:11.361 --> 24:15.681
before someone suddenly found out
they could use that as an unaesthetic.

24:15.801 --> 24:18.241
Before that, you know what they did?

24:18.361 --> 24:23.841
If someone had their leg blown off
in some battle...

24:23.961 --> 24:30.081
they put the remaining stump of that leg
into boiling oil.

24:30.201 --> 24:34.161
And do you think this God of yours...
What did He do?

24:34.281 --> 24:38.201
Did He smell that smell
of burning flesh and enjoyed it?

24:38.321 --> 24:44.241
Because He also had thousands
of women burned as witches.

24:44.361 --> 24:46.481
Did He like that smell?

24:46.601 --> 24:51.481
And when He sent down cholera,
typhoid fever, black plague...

24:51.601 --> 24:55.721
and after a while, then He had
someone invent the microscope...

24:55.841 --> 24:59.521
because He forget to mention
the microscope in the Bible.

24:59.641 --> 25:04.801
And now He has sent down a virus
punishing people for making love.

25:04.921 --> 25:07.641
And you know what He did?

25:07.761 --> 25:10.721
Just now, He had someone
inventing a medicine for that.

25:10.841 --> 25:14.201
A cure for that,
that only the rich people can afford.

25:14.321 --> 25:15.881
You know what I think?

25:15.961 --> 25:24.201
I think this whole Creation
is some fucking big, sadistic conspiracy.

25:24.321 --> 25:27.241
All this here? You think that's sadistic?

25:27.361 --> 25:30.321
You blame God for what mankind
have done to each other?

25:30.441 --> 25:32.161
You know what I blame God for?

25:32.281 --> 25:33.681
Do you know what I blame God for?

25:42.081 --> 25:43.481
Shit.

25:46.041 --> 25:49.841
Damn. Yeah, you like that, don't you?

25:50.561 --> 25:53.881
You enjoy that.

25:54.081 --> 25:55.481
Fuck.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.961
Are you sleeping?

26:12.081 --> 26:13.521
Arne?

26:17.201 --> 26:19.481
Is this sleep?

27:58.521 --> 28:00.401
Can I help you?

28:01.961 --> 28:03.961
Want some help?

28:08.321 --> 28:09.601
It's okay.

28:09.721 --> 28:12.321
It's okay. Go.

28:28.521 --> 28:30.441
Anna Belle Grey.

28:32.521 --> 28:36.161
- Heard of her?
- Excuse me?

28:41.241 --> 28:44.961
Anna Belle Grey
is an astonishing beauty...

28:45.121 --> 28:47.721
with two heads and three tits.

28:47.841 --> 28:51.161
- Is this a cartoon?
- No, it's for real.

28:51.281 --> 28:53.281
- I've seen pictures.
- Really?

28:53.401 --> 28:56.081
- Beautiful.
- A girl with two heads?

28:56.201 --> 28:58.481
And three tits.
That's the most important thing.

28:58.601 --> 29:02.281
- And from the waist down totally normal.
- Really?

29:02.401 --> 29:06.201
You should check her out. She's
beautiful.

29:06.321 --> 29:09.961
That's the kind of girl I like.
Imagine the possibilities.

29:10.121 --> 29:13.321
You can have whatever you like
with those two heads.

29:30.961 --> 29:32.721
So if this is...

29:35.641 --> 29:41.961
If this goes on, it goes
on behind the hill.

29:42.121 --> 29:46.681
That means we are here.

29:46.801 --> 29:49.321
Somewhere.

29:49.441 --> 29:51.761
You see...

29:51.881 --> 29:54.881
If you look at the compass...

30:05.841 --> 30:09.921
Where's that? It's all flat.

30:10.041 --> 30:13.681
But you have this. There.

30:17.921 --> 30:19.521
So we're there?

30:19.641 --> 30:21.961
Here.

30:23.201 --> 30:27.961
Two, three, four, five, six, seven...

30:28.121 --> 30:31.121
- That's eight.
- Eight.

30:31.241 --> 30:34.041
- Eight rivers.
- Eight more.

31:13.921 --> 31:16.881
Here we go.

31:16.961 --> 31:19.761
And another one.

31:19.881 --> 31:22.241
Miserable little fuckers.

31:22.361 --> 31:25.761
- You'll be punished for that.
- What?

31:25.881 --> 31:29.161
They will burn you in hell for that.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.641
Well...

31:42.441 --> 31:47.281
I think we're punished
enough here on earth.

31:47.401 --> 31:50.121
Sucking the blood of other creatures.

31:50.241 --> 31:53.681
How would you come up with that?

31:53.801 --> 31:57.361
Maybe that's why the world was created.

31:57.481 --> 32:00.041
To feed them.

32:00.161 --> 32:02.521
Maybe that's why you're here.

32:02.641 --> 32:04.721
Your only purpose.

32:28.761 --> 32:30.161
You know...

32:36.441 --> 32:41.201
He's dead now for almost twenty years.

32:41.321 --> 32:45.241
And sometimes... I don't know.

32:48.961 --> 32:51.241
It feels like he's...

32:56.561 --> 32:58.681
You know what I mean?

33:05.961 --> 33:08.881
You get along with your father?

33:10.721 --> 33:16.801
Well, my father is a very wealthy man.

33:16.921 --> 33:23.801
And that creates some pressure.

33:40.481 --> 33:41.481
You don't think...

33:41.601 --> 33:44.201
Nummedal would keep those photos...

33:44.321 --> 33:46.401
I don't think so.

33:52.241 --> 33:54.121
I don't know.

34:46.481 --> 34:47.920
Father.

35:03.321 --> 35:05.161
Morning.

35:50.241 --> 35:52.241
Nummedal.

36:37.441 --> 36:39.641
I was...

36:39.761 --> 36:42.041
looking for coffee.

36:51.081 --> 36:53.441
You want a coffee?

37:56.561 --> 37:58.881
Three tits.

38:00.961 --> 38:03.841
Do you hear me?

39:21.121 --> 39:23.801
Are you talking
about Scott and Amundsen?

39:23.921 --> 39:26.401
The South Pole expedition?

39:26.521 --> 39:30.401
Very fascinating story. I love that story.

39:30.521 --> 39:35.521
It's funny. I just thought
about that story when I was walking.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.961
Very beautiful. And tragic as well.

39:39.081 --> 39:41.041
I find it very tragic for Scott.

39:41.161 --> 39:44.401
I mean, he really wanted to do it.

39:44.521 --> 39:46.321
He was very ambitious.

39:46.441 --> 39:48.601
He had the first plan, actually.

39:48.721 --> 39:51.561
- Have you seen it?
- What do you mean?

39:51.681 --> 39:54.561
- Have you seen it?
- The TV series from the 80s.

39:54.681 --> 39:57.481
- You're talking about the television...
- We all saw it.

39:57.601 --> 39:59.121
We saw it.

40:01.921 --> 40:04.601
We kind of know the stories.

40:04.721 --> 40:08.841
- We know the story, of course.
- Yeah, of course.

40:08.961 --> 40:11.881
- We're Norwegians, you know.
- Sorry.

40:11.961 --> 40:17.201
But there was the tune...
Remember? The tune?

40:46.561 --> 40:50.401
Right. Need to be exact.

40:50.521 --> 40:53.921
Take Stonehenge. 60 stones.

40:54.961 --> 40:58.201
32 kilometers to get them there.
On average.

40:58.321 --> 40:59.721
On average.

40:59.841 --> 41:02.961
So you need to move those stones.

41:03.081 --> 41:06.241
Pushing a stone like that...

41:10.241 --> 41:12.681
150 metres per year. That's not a lot.

41:12.801 --> 41:16.601
No, not a lot at all.

41:16.721 --> 41:18.761
It is a lot.

41:18.881 --> 41:21.321
32,000 metres in total.

41:21.441 --> 41:23.161
Divided by 150.

41:26.601 --> 41:28.881
Two hundred years.

41:35.521 --> 41:40.601
How long did those people live for?
Thirty, forty years?

41:40.721 --> 41:42.401
They didn't get old.

41:42.521 --> 41:46.281
They never got to see it themselves,
I don't think.

41:47.401 --> 41:49.601
Wow.

41:50.561 --> 41:52.641
'How are you doing, sir?'
'I'm fine.'

41:52.761 --> 41:54.921
'Very good.
Thank you very much.'

41:55.041 --> 41:57.721
'Just give me the tripod.'
'No, it's way too heavy.'

41:57.841 --> 42:01.881
'No, it's not too heavy. I can carry it.
I'm a soldier.'

42:01.961 --> 42:05.401
Yes, exactly. Stonehenge.

42:05.521 --> 42:08.481
Cathedrals. Same story.

42:10.321 --> 42:12.761
Lugging stones around. And what for?

42:12.881 --> 42:15.321
It took ages.

42:15.441 --> 42:19.521
Stacking stone upon stone,
upon stone, upon stone.

42:19.641 --> 42:22.121
And to no purpose whatsoever.

42:25.561 --> 42:27.681
Stone...

43:06.561 --> 43:07.961
Fuck.

44:13.681 --> 44:15.241
Aztecs.

44:22.721 --> 44:26.121
They sacrificed humans.

44:26.241 --> 44:27.961
Every day.

44:32.201 --> 44:34.281
They believed that if they didn't...

44:34.401 --> 44:36.761
then the sun wouldn't come up.

44:38.161 --> 44:39.961
Anymore.

44:46.281 --> 44:49.961
They didn't know the sun would come up...

44:50.121 --> 44:51.721
anyway.

44:54.761 --> 44:56.321
So...

44:57.641 --> 44:59.401
that's...

45:01.401 --> 45:05.801
hundreds of thousands of human sacrifices.

45:05.921 --> 45:08.961
That didn't actually make sense.

45:15.721 --> 45:17.121
But...

45:27.721 --> 45:31.841
Is there a sacrifice that does make sense?

45:38.801 --> 45:43.561
Did you always want to become a geologist?

46:10.281 --> 46:13.361
Kanskje.

46:15.841 --> 46:17.561
Kanskje?

46:19.881 --> 46:25.121
You always say 'kanskje' when you
take a picture. What does it mean?

46:25.241 --> 46:26.681
It means 'maybe'.

46:26.801 --> 46:29.601
Maybe? Why do you say it?

46:29.721 --> 46:32.721
I say that?

46:34.081 --> 46:38.241
It's just that when I take a photo...

46:38.361 --> 46:41.921
it goes dark. It's something
with the battery.

46:42.041 --> 46:45.041
It shuts off. And so I
try to press it down.

46:45.161 --> 46:47.161
And then I tape it.

46:47.281 --> 46:50.681
Sometimes it works
and sometimes it doesn't.

46:50.801 --> 46:54.201
So I don't know if the pictures actually...

46:55.641 --> 46:57.401
You could buy a new camera.

46:57.521 --> 47:01.801
It's a good camera.
It's just something with the battery.

47:01.921 --> 47:04.641
Or you ask your father?

47:10.801 --> 47:14.361
Yeah, my father offers me
new things all the time.

47:18.561 --> 47:22.721
I wouldn't even consider
giving him the pleasure.

47:24.041 --> 47:26.721
Yeah, look. Now it works.

47:26.841 --> 47:29.921
Again. Suddenly there it is.

47:33.841 --> 47:35.681
I don't like new things.

49:05.041 --> 49:06.681
Fuck.

49:16.961 --> 49:19.081
You almost died today.

49:22.241 --> 49:24.881
Yes, but it's just my leg.

50:02.841 --> 50:05.081
Quite a dive.

50:05.201 --> 50:10.201
Very impressive.
You looked like an acrobat.

50:10.321 --> 50:12.681
An acrobat trying to be a clown.

50:16.721 --> 50:21.601
You know, in English they call it 'fall
in love'. I think that's quite strange.

50:21.721 --> 50:25.961
Kind of like falling into
a pit, or something.

50:26.081 --> 50:29.641
The French, they say 'tomber amoureux.'

50:29.761 --> 50:33.641
Which I find a lot more interesting.

50:33.761 --> 50:40.081
Because then it's like the falling
is a kind of state of being.

50:40.201 --> 50:43.161
The falling is the thing.

50:59.921 --> 51:02.041
And the knee?

51:03.361 --> 51:05.721
I think this will be fine.

51:05.841 --> 51:10.161
- When I do this?
- Yeah, I can feel that.

52:12.681 --> 52:16.041
Six, eight...

52:17.961 --> 52:22.161
Four, six, eight, ten.

52:22.281 --> 52:28.841
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

52:28.961 --> 52:30.401
Two...

53:56.081 --> 53:58.161
You have aerials.

54:02.761 --> 54:04.921
You have aerials of this area?

54:06.441 --> 54:07.841
Yes. Thankfully.

54:10.881 --> 54:12.921
Where did you get them?

54:17.481 --> 54:19.201
From professor Nummedal.

54:57.921 --> 55:00.401
What is this?

55:02.801 --> 55:04.281
Is this a coincidence?

55:04.401 --> 55:06.521
One, two.

55:06.641 --> 55:08.761
Eight. Why? Nine.

55:09.841 --> 55:12.841
It's like I'm not here.
I am here, aren't I?

55:24.481 --> 55:27.521
I see you're training for the triple jump.

55:30.281 --> 55:33.361
He has my aerials. My photos...

55:33.481 --> 55:35.921
- He has my aerials.
- What?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.801
- He has my aerials.
- Who?

55:37.921 --> 55:39.721
Mikkelsen.

55:41.201 --> 55:45.401
You don't understand. I was in Oslo
and Nummedal said they were lost.

55:45.521 --> 55:47.521
Mikkelsen has my aerials.

55:47.641 --> 55:51.041
So you've been talking
to professor Nummedal?

55:51.161 --> 55:53.241
He's a very old man.

55:53.361 --> 55:55.761
Almost blind.

55:55.881 --> 55:58.641
He will share. I'm sure.

56:01.761 --> 56:03.681
He has my aerials.

56:44.601 --> 56:46.281
Thirty-two.

56:48.921 --> 56:52.121
Yes, we've already been there.
We've seen that.

56:55.361 --> 56:58.081
Thirty-three is nothing. Thirty-six.

57:02.241 --> 57:03.961
Thirty-seven.

57:08.201 --> 57:09.601
Yes.

57:09.721 --> 57:11.801
Where is this? Thirty-one.

57:17.321 --> 57:20.121
Yeah, that's here. Here.

57:21.521 --> 57:24.281
That's where we were yesterday.

57:24.401 --> 57:27.121
That's the one you saw.

57:46.201 --> 57:48.401
Well, they're just pictures.

58:02.921 --> 58:05.401
Finished already?

58:07.641 --> 58:09.281
Finished already.

58:10.801 --> 58:12.481
Thank you.

59:47.561 --> 59:49.401
Where are the others?

59:49.521 --> 59:52.321
- They left.
- When?

59:53.801 --> 59:55.961
An hour ago. Or two.

59:58.881 --> 01:00:01.641
When do we see them?

01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:05.641
Oh, no. They went north now.
And we're going south. So...

01:00:05.761 --> 01:00:07.521
We won't see them.

01:00:12.961 --> 01:00:17.641
And why did they...
Was there something wrong?

01:00:17.761 --> 01:00:20.201
No.

01:00:20.321 --> 01:00:22.201
No. What do you mean?

01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:24.841
Why did they...

01:00:24.961 --> 01:00:27.121
They didn't say goodbye, or...

01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:29.961
We thought that you needed some sleep.

01:00:32.881 --> 01:00:36.841
- At least give me the tripod.
- Yeah. Later.

01:01:00.241 --> 01:01:02.641
3122.

01:01:04.201 --> 01:01:07.441
3123.

01:01:08.761 --> 01:01:11.561
3124.

01:01:13.121 --> 01:01:15.241
31... Fuck.

01:01:15.361 --> 01:01:18.321
3125.

01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:23.241
3126.

01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:26.961
3133.

01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:28.961
This is easy.

01:02:04.801 --> 01:02:07.041
Okay.

01:02:08.161 --> 01:02:10.321
Fuck it.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.401
Sorry.

01:03:49.681 --> 01:03:51.241
Sorry.

01:04:17.601 --> 01:04:21.041
Six, eight... Fifty.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:25.961
Two, four, six, eight... I can do this.

01:04:30.401 --> 01:04:32.441
Eight.

01:04:39.401 --> 01:04:42.841
Six, eight...

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:47.321
Six, eight...

01:04:49.961 --> 01:04:52.601
Six, eight...

01:04:52.721 --> 01:04:54.201
Ten.

01:05:32.121 --> 01:05:33.921
What's going on?

01:05:55.441 --> 01:06:00.601
It's completely crazy
if you think about it.

01:06:00.721 --> 01:06:05.481
Everything that happens on this planet.

01:06:09.441 --> 01:06:14.841
Eventually everything will disappear.

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:23.921
Wouldn't it be just as strange
if everything was saved?

01:06:28.601 --> 01:06:30.601
Saved?

01:06:30.721 --> 01:06:33.681
In an archive, or something.

01:06:38.521 --> 01:06:40.801
Saved in an archive.

01:06:43.441 --> 01:06:45.841
You mean everything?

01:06:45.961 --> 01:06:52.561
Every sound and every little...

01:06:52.681 --> 01:06:54.361
Everything?

01:06:54.481 --> 01:06:57.521
Every sound, every thought, every...

01:06:57.641 --> 01:07:01.321
You know. The wind, the colours.
Everything that's here.

01:07:01.441 --> 01:07:04.161
And everywhere else in the universe.

01:07:04.281 --> 01:07:07.641
That would be so much information...

01:07:07.761 --> 01:07:11.121
that it would create a second universe.

01:07:11.241 --> 01:07:13.761
You mean, like a back-up.

01:07:16.601 --> 01:07:18.561
A back-up.

01:07:18.681 --> 01:07:23.841
But then you need another back-up
from that back-up.

01:07:23.961 --> 01:07:27.561
So then you have a back-up
from a back-up...

01:07:27.681 --> 01:07:32.241
from a back-up, from a back-up,
from a back-up. And that doesn't...

01:07:40.201 --> 01:07:42.121
Where are we going?

01:07:51.081 --> 01:07:52.841
That's nice.

01:07:55.401 --> 01:07:59.801
- Thank you.
- Yes, that's really nice.

01:07:59.921 --> 01:08:02.641
I think it's important to do good notes.

01:08:05.601 --> 01:08:07.601
Good notes.

01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:10.081
Real notes.

01:08:11.761 --> 01:08:16.241
If something happens to me,
someone can read the notes...

01:08:16.361 --> 01:08:19.441
and everything will make sense.

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:29.321
We've got to go south.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.481
No, I got mine, thank you.

01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:49.680
South. That's there.

01:09:00.841 --> 01:09:03.441
- Yep.
- Yeah, you're ready?

01:10:27.801 --> 01:10:34.281
<i>You know, I have my moods
from time to time</i>

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:38.121
<i>perfection's what I've got to find</i>

01:11:21.561 --> 01:11:23.241
No, that can't be.

01:13:55.081 --> 01:13:57.841
Come on. That's right.

01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:34.681
No. Not again.

01:15:19.521 --> 01:15:21.361
Twenty-two.

01:15:21.481 --> 01:15:25.481
Twenty-three. Twenty-four.

01:15:31.241 --> 01:15:33.881
One point...

01:15:34.881 --> 01:15:36.961
One point three.

01:16:42.361 --> 01:16:43.921
So.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.881
You're from the Netherlands?

01:16:47.961 --> 01:16:53.961
Beautiful country. And the Dutch...
Very intelligent people.

01:16:54.121 --> 01:17:00.961
No mountains. No highlands,
glaciers or waterfalls.

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:03.481
Just swampland, mud and clay.

01:17:03.601 --> 01:17:06.801
Very intelligent people. Very clever.
I love the Netherlands.

01:17:06.921 --> 01:17:10.161
They don't have mountains,
highlands or glaciers.

01:17:10.281 --> 01:17:11.681
Only swamp.

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:15.961
Every other square meter,
there's a geologist with a microscope.

01:17:16.121 --> 01:17:20.201
There's a geologist.
Ha, ha-ha, isn't that funny?

01:17:20.321 --> 01:17:24.961
Every grain of sand is being weighed
in the Netherlands.

01:17:25.121 --> 01:17:26.801
Bang. Ow.

01:17:26.921 --> 01:17:28.961
That's nothing to do with geology.

01:17:29.081 --> 01:17:32.121
- Nothing to do with geology, my son.
- I'm not your son.

01:17:32.241 --> 01:17:33.641
That's bookkeeping.

01:17:33.761 --> 01:17:36.801
That is bookkeeping. Oh, fuck off.

01:17:36.921 --> 01:17:38.801
Fuck off, professor.

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:42.481
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

01:17:48.561 --> 01:17:52.681
- The real problems, my boy...
- The great scientific questions.

01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:56.921
- The great scientific questions.
- The real problems.

01:17:57.041 --> 01:18:01.401
Where does our planet come from?

01:18:05.561 --> 01:18:09.361
- What will be the future?
- What is its future?

01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:13.721
Will we be hit by a new ice age?

01:18:13.841 --> 01:18:17.041
Will there be another ice age?
I have no idea.

01:18:17.161 --> 01:18:19.481
But that's what science is about.

01:18:19.601 --> 01:18:22.561
Fuck off, professor.

01:18:24.961 --> 01:18:26.881
Science.

01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:30.281
Science.

01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:35.441
Of course. Yes, professor Nummedal.

01:18:35.561 --> 01:18:37.241
I get it. Put it right there for you.

01:18:37.361 --> 01:18:39.561
- Science.
- They're so beautiful.

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:42.601
The titanic effort of
the human intellect...

01:18:42.721 --> 01:18:45.281
to break free from its cosmic isolation...

01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:49.321
- One of these days...
- and deepen its understanding.

01:19:03.201 --> 01:19:05.241
That's what science is about.

01:19:05.361 --> 01:19:08.121
The titanic effort of
the human intellect...

01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:12.041
to break free from its
cosmic isolation by...

01:19:12.161 --> 01:19:14.241
understanding. Don't you...

01:19:14.361 --> 01:19:16.881
So why don't you pick another course?

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:19.961
Like what?
I don't know. Anything.

01:19:20.121 --> 01:19:24.241
Economics, law, business
administration, management.

01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:26.481
Medicine.

01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:27.961
Right.

01:19:28.121 --> 01:19:29.521
Join the army.

01:19:29.641 --> 01:19:33.081
Sure, I could join the army. Why not?

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:35.401
I can always join the army.

01:19:36.961 --> 01:19:39.281
Give me twenty.
Okay.

01:19:42.761 --> 01:19:44.201
You passed it.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:46.401
Yeah, I got it.

01:19:46.521 --> 01:19:48.121
Here.

01:19:55.361 --> 01:19:58.161
Lost it. We lost it.

01:19:58.641 --> 01:20:01.361
- Mikkelsen, you hear me?
- Yes, professor. Of course, professor.

01:20:01.481 --> 01:20:03.681
You see the Dutchman?
Stay away from the Dutchman.

01:20:03.801 --> 01:20:05.521
Okay, professor.

01:20:05.641 --> 01:20:08.881
- He wants your stones.
- I completely understand.

01:20:08.961 --> 01:20:12.761
He wants your aerials.
Stay away from him. Stand back.

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:22.801
Oh yeah, of course. He's a very old man.

01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:24.961
He's a very old man.

01:20:26.321 --> 01:20:28.241
No, I cannot.

01:20:28.361 --> 01:20:31.521
I'm very sorry, professor. I cannot.

01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:51.841
Okay, now. Seriously.

01:21:39.801 --> 01:21:45.721
<i>Some are born to sweet delight</i>

01:21:45.841 --> 01:21:50.201
<i>some are born to endless night</i>

01:21:55.481 --> 01:22:01.081
<i>some are born to sweet delight</i>

01:22:02.241 --> 01:22:07.241
<i>some are born to endless night</i>

01:24:32.281 --> 01:24:33.921
Are you hungry?

01:24:34.041 --> 01:24:35.921
Me too.

01:24:44.241 --> 01:24:46.681
Yes. Exactly.

01:25:01.681 --> 01:25:04.081
One.

01:25:04.201 --> 01:25:06.361
Two. Okay.

01:25:08.081 --> 01:25:12.961
Hang on. So that makes two and a half.

01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:16.961
Two and a half.

01:25:17.121 --> 01:25:22.761
Two, four, six, eight, sixty.

01:25:22.881 --> 01:25:27.041
Two, four, six, eight, seventy.

01:25:27.161 --> 01:25:29.121
Four. No, four.

01:25:29.241 --> 01:25:32.521
Six, eight, eighty.

01:25:35.841 --> 01:25:37.241
Ninety.

01:25:37.361 --> 01:25:42.681
Two, four, six, eight. One hundred.

01:25:43.521 --> 01:25:47.681
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:54.281
Fifty-two. And eight. Fifty-seven.

01:26:05.681 --> 01:26:08.041
See?

01:26:08.161 --> 01:26:11.601
Spot on. Keep going.

01:28:06.321 --> 01:28:07.961
Arne, Arne.

01:28:08.121 --> 01:28:13.841
I tell you, it was my compass
that was wrong.

01:28:13.961 --> 01:28:18.441
And it was yours that was right.

01:28:22.921 --> 01:28:28.921
Let's not go into that too much.

01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:31.961
My compass was wrong,
your compass was right.

01:28:32.121 --> 01:28:37.641
It doesn't matter. It's just...
It's just a compass.

01:32:22.841 --> 01:32:25.161
Is this sleep?

01:32:25.281 --> 01:32:28.881
No. This is...

01:32:32.201 --> 01:32:34.761
This is not sleep.

01:36:48.241 --> 01:36:50.761
And you found this with the body?

01:37:05.761 --> 01:37:08.961
How long hadn't you seen Arne
before you found him?

01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:15.561
A couple of days.

01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:28.841
Here you are.

01:37:40.481 --> 01:37:43.041
- Do you speak English?
- What?

01:37:43.161 --> 01:37:45.721
Do you speak English?

01:37:45.841 --> 01:37:48.681
Are you waiting for the bus?

01:37:56.641 --> 01:37:59.681
Where are you going?

01:38:02.921 --> 01:38:05.201
To the Netherlands.

01:38:09.281 --> 01:38:12.841
So you have been to North Cape?

01:38:12.961 --> 01:38:14.561
No.

01:38:17.961 --> 01:38:20.801
I spent some time on a Fjell.

01:38:20.921 --> 01:38:22.921
Fishing?

01:38:23.041 --> 01:38:26.321
No, doing geological...

01:38:26.441 --> 01:38:28.241
I study geology.

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:32.961
I did some research
about mountains and rocks.

01:38:35.241 --> 01:38:36.961
Did you find anything?

01:38:37.121 --> 01:38:39.601
Anything interesting?

01:38:59.641 --> 01:39:01.281
Can you help me with this?

01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:07.801
Here, this part. It's Norwegian.

01:39:14.161 --> 01:39:16.521
It's raining today.

01:39:16.641 --> 01:39:19.841
I will take a short trip.

01:39:22.361 --> 01:39:23.881
Here, this part.

01:39:31.961 --> 01:39:36.201
Alfred is still not back.

01:39:37.481 --> 01:39:41.681
I'm worried. But I won't go searching.

01:39:41.801 --> 01:39:44.281
I will wait for him here.

01:39:45.321 --> 01:39:46.761
A week maybe.

01:39:46.881 --> 01:39:48.961
And...

01:39:52.641 --> 01:39:55.521
The terrain...

01:39:55.641 --> 01:40:00.961
is making it a little bit
hard for him. And...

01:40:01.081 --> 01:40:05.081
But I really look up to him...

01:40:05.201 --> 01:40:07.441
because he's like...

01:40:09.481 --> 01:40:12.201
Never saying a bad word.

01:40:12.321 --> 01:40:17.441
And still he had some nasty falls.

01:40:25.321 --> 01:40:28.161
Amazing man.

01:40:28.281 --> 01:40:33.121
He just keeps going.

01:40:33.241 --> 01:40:36.441
- And...
- It's okay.

01:40:36.561 --> 01:40:37.961
Thank you.

01:40:47.481 --> 01:40:49.081
Is it you?

01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:55.601
Alfred?

01:41:13.201 --> 01:41:17.401
- What's your name?
- Inger Marie.

01:41:17.521 --> 01:41:19.961
- Inger Maria.
- Marie.

01:41:21.121 --> 01:41:22.921
Inger Marie.

01:41:34.641 --> 01:41:37.961
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:41:38.081 --> 01:41:40.281
- Where is that?
- Honningsvåg.

01:41:40.401 --> 01:41:43.161
Oh, really? Wow.

01:41:44.281 --> 01:41:46.561
It must get pretty dark in winter.

01:41:46.681 --> 01:41:48.401
Very dark.

01:41:48.521 --> 01:41:50.681
And nothing to do.

01:42:00.401 --> 01:42:02.961
- How old are you?
- I'm fifteen.

01:42:08.961 --> 01:42:10.801
What are you laughing at?

01:42:14.281 --> 01:42:16.361
I don't know.

01:43:14.161 --> 01:43:21.361
