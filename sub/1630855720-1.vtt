<i>Once upon a time, a specific time,</i>

00:16.767 --> 00:23.023
<i>July 5th, 1825 to be exact,
52 men and women sailed out of Norway</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:25.859
<i>in an undersized sloop
they named</i> Restauration<i>.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:31.865
<i>These immigrants
sought religious freedom from persecution,</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:33.534
<i>so they fled to America.</i>

00:35.994 --> 00:40.499
<i>Not just an improbable crossing,
an impossible one.</i>

00:44.837 --> 00:46.672
<i>How in the world did they make it?</i>

00:51.969 --> 00:53.595
<i>They had help, that's how.</i>

00:57.891 --> 00:59.643
<i>Tell me your journey, each of you.</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:04.147
<i>Tell me your life's voyage,
and I will tell you who you are.</i>

01:16.577 --> 01:20.914
<i>This fairy tale begins in a library
in Queens.</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:30.257
Hello! Hello!

01:31.967 --> 01:33.594
I am in distress!

01:34.678 --> 01:35.846
This is dire!

01:37.514 --> 01:39.349
I am in need of a toilet!

01:39.349 --> 01:42.895
Listen to my voice. Can you hear me?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.731
I got ears, don't I? Look.

01:45.731 --> 01:49.067
Well, you see I have ears too,
so why are you yelling?

01:49.943 --> 01:53.405
I need a piece of ID
before I give you the bathroom key.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.324
I don't have ID.

01:57.326 --> 01:58.785
Leave your bags here with me.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.580
These contain state secrets!

02:02.497 --> 02:03.498
Okay.

02:26.980 --> 02:27.981
Thank you, ma'am.

02:28.732 --> 02:29.733
My pleasure.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.091
- Hi.
- Do you need something?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.467
I was gonna help you with him.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.974
- Seems like you got that all figured out.
- Imagine that.

03:05.477 --> 03:06.854
Apollo.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.021
As in Creed?

03:08.605 --> 03:09.898
Actually, yeah, kinda.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.366
Do you wanna go, like--
Do you wanna go to dinner with me?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.832
- Please.
- No.

03:27.541 --> 03:31.211
<i>If Emma Valentine thought
Apollo Kagwa would give up this easily,</i>

03:31.211 --> 03:32.379
<i>she was mistaken.</i>

03:34.298 --> 03:38.051
<i>But to understand why and how
in the world, we must first go back.</i>

03:40.804 --> 03:41.889
<i>Way back.</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:49.062
<i>It was during
the great garbage strike of 1968</i>

03:49.563 --> 03:51.690
<i>that Brian West met Lillian Kagwa.</i>

03:59.656 --> 04:00.657
How are ya?

04:01.658 --> 04:04.286
I'm here to see a Mr. Pavel Arsenyev.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.333
Mr. Arsenyev, there's a...

04:09.333 --> 04:12.503
It's Brian West. Brian West.

04:12.503 --> 04:13.921
Brian West here to see you.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.839
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

04:19.009 --> 04:20.010
He'll be right out.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.429
Thank you.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.850
I'm his parole officer.

04:28.060 --> 04:32.898
I'm not supposed to tell you that though,
so you gotta keep that between us, right?

04:44.493 --> 04:47.538
- Kwagwa, that's an interesting name.
- Kagwa.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.874
Kwagwa. Kwaga.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.711
I don't date white men.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.591
Me neither.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.430
Hey, Kragwa. Kragwa.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.226
Lillian. Listen,

05:09.226 --> 05:13.814
a lot more monitoring needs to be done
around here, so I'll be back, all right?

05:14.523 --> 05:15.524
I'll see you later.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.491
Hey. That man is bad for business,

05:24.491 --> 05:29.204
and since he's so smitten with you,
that makes you bad for business, so...

05:29.705 --> 05:31.707
No, Mr. Arsenyev, I need this job.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.042
I don't want to hear it. Go.
Get your stuff.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.675
Hey, look who it is.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.847
Modeling agency/money laundering racket.
Not smart, Pavel. Not pretty.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.726
Not pretty at all. Back to jail for you.

06:00.319 --> 06:06.283
You got me fired. New job pays half.
New apartment only has one room.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.077
I liked it at the modeling agency.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.291
Just give me a chance.

06:14.958 --> 06:15.959
Never.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.384
<i>And he couldn't stay away.</i>

06:36.855 --> 06:37.689
Yes.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.817
<i>And that there is how Brian met Lillian,</i>

06:40.817 --> 06:43.487
<i>but didn't go on a real date
until years later.</i>

06:45.280 --> 06:47.616
You know, there's this place
right around the corner.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.493
It's really good. They have great--

06:49.493 --> 06:51.870
That's nice, but no.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.540
<i>Some may call that stalking.</i>

06:55.290 --> 06:57.501
<i>Apollo called it persistence.</i>

06:58.794 --> 07:01.547
Personally, I enjoy the simple things
like a stroll through the park

07:01.547 --> 07:03.131
- or something at the be--
- No.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.846
- Hey. Do you maybe just wanna go to--
- No.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.404
Yes.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.911
Re-- Great.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.705
Yeah.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.834
- Boones Mill?
- Yeah.

07:38.834 --> 07:42.087
Yeah, you haven't heard of it.
Population, 285.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.259
It's just where my parents landed,
I guess.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.136
Well, I bet your parents
have a lot of cool stories

07:49.136 --> 07:52.055
- about Boones fucking Mill.
- I've never spoken to them.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.893
No, I mean,
I'm sure I have actually spoken to them.

07:55.893 --> 08:00.230
I just don't remember the conversation
because they died when I was five.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.733
- I'm s--
- Don't-- Yeah. It's not a thing.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.070
So, how'd they die?

08:07.905 --> 08:08.906
Unimportant.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.616
Well, what happened?

08:10.616 --> 08:11.909
- To them?
- To you.

08:12.618 --> 08:15.204
Well, my sister Kim adopted me.
She's 13 years older.

08:15.204 --> 08:16.288
Shit.

08:16.288 --> 08:20.375
And Ms. Rook, the local librarian.
She would look after me when Kim couldn't.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.796
And she would let me and my best friend,
Michelle, watch all the movies.

08:25.380 --> 08:29.218
One day, I was 12,
and I picked up this movie at random--

08:29.218 --> 08:32.179
Well, random, it was the only movie
in the entire library

08:32.179 --> 08:34.181
that had Black people on the cover.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.432
- <i>Quilombo</i>.
- Okay.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.558
It's about the uprisings in Brazil,
and it's just like

08:37.558 --> 08:40.270
a ton of Portuguese people
just getting, like...

08:40.895 --> 08:43.982
brutally killed by slaves.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.237
That's fucking awesome.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.240
Yeah, actually, it was watching that movie
that made me--

08:52.449 --> 08:53.450
- What?
- Oh, my God.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.077
Do you know that I just realized
right this second

08:55.077 --> 08:57.246
that movies are called movies
because they move.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.082
Movies!

09:01.333 --> 09:03.043
I haven't thought about that one.
It's true.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.878
- Wow.
- Well, they do move.

09:10.884 --> 09:16.557
Anyhoo. <i>Quilombo</i> made me realize
how big the world was.

09:17.057 --> 09:21.436
Bigger than Boones fucking Mill.
And I wanted to see it. All of it.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.944
What about your peeps?

09:34.116 --> 09:36.910
One sad story's enough for the first date.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.710
Wow.
One of your eyes is bigger than the other.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.420
- God.
- What?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.797
That's not a bad thing.
That's a beautiful thing.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.716
I think it's gorgeous, frankly.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.343
You're the most gorgeous person
I've ever seen.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.929
Ever known. I mean, your soul is--

09:55.929 --> 09:57.264
- My soul?
- Yeah.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.348
Dude, no.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.100
- I mean, think of the kids we'd have.
- Kids?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.186
- I never cared if I had a boy, a girl...
- Okay.

10:02.186 --> 10:07.733
- ...twins, triplets, quadruplet--
- Okay. Apollo. Stop. Seriously.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.944
What? I mean,
some people wanna be an astronaut,

10:10.944 --> 10:14.740
some people wanna be a scientist,
some people wanna be a zookeeper.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.492
- A zookeeper? That's pretty cool.
- I just wanna be a good father

10:18.076 --> 10:19.453
to the kid I end up having.

10:23.165 --> 10:26.627
No, don't do that. Don't do that look.
Do a different look.

10:30.088 --> 10:34.551
The reason I said no to you
when you first asked me out--

10:34.551 --> 10:36.094
And the six times after that.

10:37.221 --> 10:39.056
And the six times after that

10:40.724 --> 10:44.394
is because I'm moving to Brazil,
and I don't know for how long.

10:46.813 --> 10:47.814
That can't be.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.858
And yet, it does be.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.238
No. No. I'm the god Apollo.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.322
Excuse me?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.910
- I am the god Apollo...
- God.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.412
...and I command you to stay.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.200
<i>This is the final boarding call,</i>

11:40.200 --> 11:45.455
- <i>flight 613 to São Paulo at Gate 530.</i>
- Goodbye.

11:45.956 --> 11:49.459
<i>Final boarding call
for flight 613 to São Paulo.</i>

11:49.960 --> 11:54.548
<i>All ticketed passengers,
please board now at Gate 530.</i>

12:04.308 --> 12:05.475
Sake?

12:05.475 --> 12:07.644
I don't drink, but--

12:08.145 --> 12:09.479
Idiots don't drink.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.064
You don't drink?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.149
Yeah. Idiot.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.151
Thank you.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.613
So, tell me something else.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.072
What should I tell ya?

12:20.157 --> 12:22.659
Well, you can't know anything
until you know everything,

12:22.659 --> 12:24.828
so everything it is.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.538
Everything it is--

12:28.332 --> 12:29.875
<i>Well, I was born in Syracuse.</i>

12:30.459 --> 12:32.836
<i>My family moved down here,
so I was raised in the city.</i>

12:33.962 --> 12:35.506
<i>I spent a lot of time in the theater.</i>

12:36.089 --> 12:40.177
<i>I used to love watching the pictures,
you know, I'd sell my little candy,</i>

12:40.177 --> 12:41.345
<i>try and make some money.</i>

12:42.554 --> 12:44.431
<i>I grew up fast. You know, New York, it...</i>

12:44.431 --> 12:46.183
- Thank you.
- <i>...it'll do that to you.</i>

12:52.189 --> 12:55.984
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's just a friend. He delivers groceries.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.736
- You're so stupid.
- You fucking whore.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.488
- I'm a whore?
- You're invisible.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.281
I'm invisible? Well, I'm not invisible

13:01.281 --> 13:04.243
when I'm looking your micropecker
in its teeny-tiny, little beady eyes.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.661
<i>They drank a lot, and...</i>

13:05.661 --> 13:07.329
What are you looking at?

13:07.329 --> 13:09.831
<i>...I didn't like
spending a lot of time at home.</i>

13:15.420 --> 13:16.588
I'm sorry.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.384
No, I'm sorry.
I should be asking about you.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.767
One sad story is enough for a first date.

13:30.811 --> 13:31.645
I want children.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.022
Excuse me?

13:34.022 --> 13:35.274
I want children. I do.

13:35.274 --> 13:38.151
I want the chance
to be a good husband and a great father.

13:38.151 --> 13:42.155
I think I could do that, you know. I do.
I want a redo.

13:43.866 --> 13:47.202
Maybe we save the wedding planning
until after the movie.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.038
Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea.

14:24.114 --> 14:27.618
Welcome to Lubbick, Weiss and Blackwood.
That's me.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.038
Let me show you to your desk.

14:35.709 --> 14:40.839
<i>It would be accurate to say
that Lillian's first child and only child</i>

14:40.839 --> 14:42.925
<i>was conceived in the beautiful blur</i>

14:43.884 --> 14:45.135
<i>of 1977.</i>

15:02.194 --> 15:05.572
<i>You making yourself a pappy show Melda</i>

15:06.907 --> 15:09.618
<i>You making yourself a bloody clown</i>

15:10.869 --> 15:14.414
<i>Up and down the country looking for Obeah</i>

15:15.249 --> 15:18.544
<i>And your perspiration smell so strong, Well...</i>

15:19.711 --> 15:22.756
<i>Girl, you only wasting time</i>

15:43.986 --> 15:48.866
General Service Unit.
Our car, it's run out of petrol.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.534
Are you carrying any?

15:52.202 --> 15:53.579
Identification.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.891
You, get out. Open the boot.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.602
We can open it from here.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.026
Get out.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.739
I would prefer to stay with my sisters.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.211
Stop it. Hold it. Stop it.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.505
Stop!

16:48.342 --> 16:49.343
Arthur.

16:53.847 --> 16:54.848
Arthur!

17:04.441 --> 17:07.444
Arthur! Arthur! Arthur!

17:10.030 --> 17:13.116
Arthur! Arthur!

17:41.311 --> 17:43.689
I will never let anything happen to you.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.442
I will protect you
with my breath and soul.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.824
Hey, would it be weird
to name a Black kid Rocky?

17:56.869 --> 17:58.829
Wouldn't be weird to name him Apollo.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.040
Apollo.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.209
Yeah.

18:05.961 --> 18:09.715
Hey, you are the god Apollo.

18:12.968 --> 18:15.095
<i>And they lived happily ever after.</i>

18:18.307 --> 18:20.767
<i>Or at least for a few years.</i>

18:21.935 --> 18:27.399
<i>By Apollo's fourth birthday,
Brian West was gone. Vanished.</i>

19:29.086 --> 19:30.087
They're coming.

19:36.844 --> 19:37.845
<i>Bad dream?</i>

19:40.639 --> 19:42.266
It was so strange.

19:43.350 --> 19:48.105
It's this dream that I used to have
all the time when I was little.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.608
About what?

19:53.861 --> 19:54.862
My dad.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.741
My dad, he left when I was four.

20:01.702 --> 20:04.204
But in the dream,
he finally comes back home.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.125
Does he stay?

20:09.626 --> 20:11.044
I never get to that part.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.758
In real life, he never came back.

20:20.721 --> 20:21.722
I'm sorry.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.693
Shit.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.588
"<i>The Sorcerers of Dobu</i>."

21:03.931 --> 21:07.976
Granny and Pops died in each other's arms,
left behind this collection.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.235
Nice books here.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.404
Some of them look good enough to steal.

21:23.492 --> 21:24.660
I'm just kidding.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.578
It's a joke.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.958
I am going to take all of these
for a hundred.

21:33.585 --> 21:34.711
- Deal.
- Deal?

21:35.337 --> 21:37.297
- Yeah.
- Great.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.470
Lubbick, Weiss and Blackwood.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.721
Yes.

22:01.572 --> 22:02.573
Thank you.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.077
Books.

22:28.849 --> 22:29.850
Yes!

22:49.203 --> 22:51.955
Hello, my name is Apollo Kagwa.

22:54.875 --> 22:59.421
Okay. I am the god Apollo.
I am the god Apollo.

23:08.722 --> 23:12.559
<i>Apollo would find himself wondering
if he actually was frightening.</i>

23:13.977 --> 23:15.812
<i>Why else would his father have left him?</i>

23:17.648 --> 23:20.108
Check 14.50.

23:21.735 --> 23:22.736
Okay.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.495
"<i>Witches Still Live</i>." Okay.

23:32.996 --> 23:33.997
Okay.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.381
"Aleister Crowley."

23:47.803 --> 23:50.097
"Some men are born sodomites,

23:50.097 --> 23:54.560
some achieve sodomy
and some have sodomy thrust upon them."

23:58.522 --> 24:00.774
What? This will sell
for at least ten thousand.

24:01.775 --> 24:02.776
How?

24:03.443 --> 24:05.821
- Okay.
- <i>The find of his life,</i>

24:05.821 --> 24:10.158
- <i>and no one there to share the news.</i>
- Wow. That is crazy.

24:11.577 --> 24:13.662
<i>Apollo Kagwa missed her.</i>

25:33.200 --> 25:34.368
Apollo.

25:34.368 --> 25:35.494
Dad?

25:37.037 --> 25:38.038
Dad?

25:38.580 --> 25:39.581
Dad?

26:36.889 --> 26:38.974
"A baby is a dream made real.

26:38.974 --> 26:40.893
But dreams
are the fairies' favorite meal."

26:43.103 --> 26:45.272
<i>Apollo had always loved reading,</i>

26:45.272 --> 26:47.858
<i>but when he held this one,
it was different.</i>

26:55.115 --> 26:56.825
That was your father's box.

26:58.535 --> 27:00.537
Apollo, where did you find this box?

27:02.956 --> 27:04.041
You're coming with me.

27:19.723 --> 27:20.724
Shit.

27:31.068 --> 27:32.402
<i>I'm coming home tomorrow.</i>

27:32.402 --> 27:34.321
<i>My flight doesn't arrive
until late at night,</i>

27:34.321 --> 27:36.990
<i>and you might not even be interested
in seeing me anymore,</i>

27:36.990 --> 27:41.745
<i>but if you were, I'd love your face
to be the first one I find in arrivals.</i>

27:47.292 --> 27:48.293
Thank you.

27:50.963 --> 27:55.175
<i>Attention, passengers
on flight 873 with service to Munich,</i>

27:55.175 --> 27:58.762
<i>your gate has been changed to 540.</i>

28:10.858 --> 28:16.029
<i>Will passenger A. Dos Santos come
to the arrival information desk.</i>

28:49.563 --> 28:50.564
You waited.

28:59.698 --> 29:00.824
All right.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.784
When I got to Salvador,

29:02.784 --> 29:06.079
I stayed with a family
in a neighborhood called Itapuã.

29:06.079 --> 29:09.750
There was a lake there, a lagoon,
called Lagoa do Abaeté.

29:11.001 --> 29:13.921
They told me not to go,
but I didn't listen.

29:41.365 --> 29:44.743
They told you not to come.
And yet, here you are.

29:45.536 --> 29:46.870
Why is that?

29:49.289 --> 29:51.333
Because I am not frightened.

29:52.501 --> 29:54.169
You should be.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.297
Three wishes. For your life. Emma.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.426
How do you know my name?

30:13.105 --> 30:16.316
Three wishes,
before these three knots are tied.

30:21.488 --> 30:22.614
For now.

30:26.368 --> 30:27.870
After.

30:30.914 --> 30:33.333
And beyond.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.630
Be careful what you wish for, Emma.

30:45.929 --> 30:46.930
Yes.

30:53.604 --> 30:54.771
Don't cut!

30:57.191 --> 31:00.694
<i>One must be so careful
what one wishes for.</i>

31:04.781 --> 31:08.368
When it falls off my wrist,
those three wishes will come true.

31:09.536 --> 31:11.830
Do not cut it. <i>Não corta-la</i>.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.588
- That's what she said.
- You're weird.

31:19.588 --> 31:23.592
So this thing's been on my skin
for more than six months.

31:24.718 --> 31:25.969
Let me see.

31:27.679 --> 31:29.389
It does look sturdy.

31:29.389 --> 31:30.724
But you know what?

31:31.934 --> 31:35.062
I am the god Apollo.

31:46.365 --> 31:47.866
<i>Começou.</i>

31:56.959 --> 32:01.463
Emma, with me, all three of your wishes
will come true.

32:04.174 --> 32:05.175
I promise.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.223
You may kiss the bride.

33:08.864 --> 33:11.575
Nice. Okay, let's do it.

33:13.869 --> 33:15.495
Let's see.

33:18.373 --> 33:20.792
Yeah. "Shit got real."

33:21.960 --> 33:22.961
All right.

33:27.424 --> 33:29.510
Yes. Yes, I am.

33:31.595 --> 33:33.222
And then the last one.

33:43.649 --> 33:44.775
What?

33:50.239 --> 33:52.783
What? Oh, my God.

34:18.308 --> 34:21.353
Goddamn. Okay.

34:23.772 --> 34:24.773
Hi.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.025
Forty regular?

34:28.025 --> 34:31.196
Yeah. Y-- Three for Michelle Tramble.

34:32.406 --> 34:33.574
Forty regular?

34:35.074 --> 34:38.911
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I know you meant my jacket here.

34:39.496 --> 34:40.330
Could I get--

34:40.330 --> 34:42.331
- Sir.
- Okay.

34:43.958 --> 34:44.960
I will do that.

34:47.295 --> 34:48.297
Nice.

34:51.632 --> 34:52.759
Okay. Just go--

35:02.352 --> 35:03.687
I mean, you do have an idea...

35:03.687 --> 35:06.481
- Hey, cute-face.
- ...but the two of us combined-- Hi.

35:06.481 --> 35:10.068
- Hey! Here he is! Father of the bride!
- Hey, I know your face.

35:12.779 --> 35:13.614
Yeah.

35:13.614 --> 35:14.990
Okay.

35:14.990 --> 35:16.783
I'm glad you're so jovial.

35:17.284 --> 35:18.410
Nice jacket.

35:18.410 --> 35:21.830
- Thank you.
- Anything?

35:21.830 --> 35:23.874
- No, nothing good.
- Good try, anyway.

35:23.874 --> 35:26.043
Yes, please. And a bourbon.

35:26.043 --> 35:28.378
- Yeah, please, a double-shot bourbon.
- Okay.

35:28.378 --> 35:32.049
I hear that you two are going
to the planet of natural childbirth next.

35:32.049 --> 35:36.512
I'm sorry, but that's just one step
too far for me. It's dangerous.

35:36.512 --> 35:38.347
- Okay, stop.
- What?

35:39.014 --> 35:42.351
- And you sound like my mother-in-law.
- She clearly reads the news.

35:42.351 --> 35:45.437
Yeah, well, you are forgetting
that my sister is a doula,

35:45.437 --> 35:47.523
- and she's gonna be right there with us...
- Can you pass--

35:47.523 --> 35:48.732
...in the living room.

35:48.732 --> 35:49.983
- In your home?
- Yes.

35:49.983 --> 35:52.319
- I thought you just meant no drugs.
- No.

35:52.319 --> 35:55.781
- No. No. Nope to home births.
- Stop.

35:55.781 --> 35:59.409
You are not third-world peasants
or wealthy white folks

35:59.409 --> 36:01.495
- or anti-hospital punks.
- Hot damn.

36:01.495 --> 36:07.459
You have been and always will be
the most stubborn person I know.

36:07.459 --> 36:08.418
Yeah, probably.

36:08.418 --> 36:11.463
Now I find out you two
only seem like sane people.

36:12.172 --> 36:13.298
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

36:14.299 --> 36:16.718
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:17.970 --> 36:18.971
Thank you.

36:19.471 --> 36:20.472
Entrées?

36:20.973 --> 36:21.974
Oh, yeah.

36:21.974 --> 36:24.893
I'll have the organic Long Island duck.

36:24.893 --> 36:26.520
<i>That shit is $75.</i>

36:26.520 --> 36:30.941
I'm gonna do the organic Colorado lamb,
please. Well done.

36:36.947 --> 36:40.284
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna just do more bread, please.

36:40.284 --> 36:42.035
Thanks, just a little bit more.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.292
What?

36:49.418 --> 36:52.462
I think this noisette
is going to come back up.

36:52.462 --> 36:56.049
- You all right?
- I think I'm gonna go find the bathroom.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.676
- Okay. It's--
- Do you need a hand?

36:58.177 --> 36:59.261
- Thank you.
- I'll go--

36:59.261 --> 37:02.639
And no, stay with Michelle. I'm good.

37:04.641 --> 37:07.311
- All right. Yell if you need me.
- Thank you.

37:09.479 --> 37:12.733
There's a nude photo of your wife
in an art gallery in Norway.

37:15.027 --> 37:16.653
Well, is it color or black-and-white?

37:16.653 --> 37:20.324
She told me about how you waited for her
at the airport

37:20.324 --> 37:22.034
when she came back from Brazil.

37:22.034 --> 37:23.702
Very sweet. Big points for you.

37:24.870 --> 37:27.331
But she had some adventures
while she was down there.

37:27.331 --> 37:29.082
I know she told you about some of 'em.

37:29.082 --> 37:30.584
Yeah, she told me about the

37:30.584 --> 37:32.336
- red string thing.
- Three wishes!

37:32.336 --> 37:36.173
- Okay.
- That was a bold move you made, Apollo.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.176
Let me tell you. I liked that.

37:40.302 --> 37:44.181
Well, I mean,
I kept the little string thing

37:44.181 --> 37:46.558
to remind me of my promise to her. Here.

37:46.558 --> 37:48.268
- See.
- I ain't touching that woo-woo thing.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.940
By the way, you should be proud.

37:53.440 --> 37:55.692
You already made two
of those wishes come true.

37:55.692 --> 37:57.986
And I know she ain't wanna tell you
what they were.

37:57.986 --> 37:59.571
Bad luck. But fuck it.

38:00.155 --> 38:02.533
I'ma just blame it on the booze.

38:03.951 --> 38:08.497
A good husband. A healthy child. And...

38:12.376 --> 38:16.296
Emma met a Norwegian photographer
while she was down there in Salvador.

38:17.464 --> 38:18.882
- What?
- They go exploring,

38:18.882 --> 38:21.802
and they find this decayed factory.
At some point, this dude has to go pee.

38:21.802 --> 38:25.264
He leaves the camera. Emma decides
that she wants to be in a photo.

38:25.264 --> 38:26.598
One that she takes herself.

38:27.391 --> 38:30.185
Emma sets the timer, walks into the shot,

38:30.686 --> 38:34.606
pulls off her dress,
and takes that photo nude.

38:35.983 --> 38:40.988
Well, a gallery owner bought the photo,
displayed it and never took it down.

38:43.073 --> 38:44.449
Sorry, I don't think I'm following.

38:44.449 --> 38:49.830
She was looking into that camera lens
like a fucking sorceress, Apollo.

38:51.790 --> 38:52.791
It's frightening.

38:57.921 --> 39:00.841
Right. And the Norway guy, who's he?

39:00.841 --> 39:03.594
I'm trying to tell you something
important, and you focused on bullshit.

39:04.845 --> 39:05.679
Okay.

39:05.679 --> 39:09.892
I'm trying to tell you Emma's third wish
in a way that won't break her trust

39:09.892 --> 39:12.811
because it's the only one
that hasn't come true yet.

39:14.771 --> 39:15.772
Okay.

39:17.691 --> 39:19.902
- I'm listening.
- They're just over here.

39:19.902 --> 39:22.029
Sir? Sir, it's your wife.

39:22.029 --> 39:23.530
- Your wife needs you.
- What do you--

39:25.282 --> 39:26.909
Hold on to me, babe. Hold on to me.

39:27.409 --> 39:28.702
Yeah, come on.

39:28.702 --> 39:30.996
- All right, we need to find--
- Wait. Michelle.

39:30.996 --> 39:34.416
No, she'll be fine, okay?
Don't worry about it. We need to find--

39:37.920 --> 39:39.379
All right, I'm gonna call a ambulance.

39:39.379 --> 39:41.465
- No. Don't. Don't call.
- Why?

39:41.465 --> 39:45.219
- Apollo, we're doing this at home, okay?
- Right. Okay.

39:47.179 --> 39:49.598
- Chambers Street.
- Yes, Chambers Street.

39:50.641 --> 39:51.642
Come on.

39:53.477 --> 39:55.270
You're doing good. You're doing good.

39:55.771 --> 39:57.022
Sorry. Excuse me.

39:58.232 --> 40:00.025
- Okay? All right.
- Yeah.

40:00.025 --> 40:02.402
Just right here. Hey, don't leave!

40:04.905 --> 40:06.823
Good, good, good. All right.

40:06.823 --> 40:09.451
Big step. We're almost there. There we go.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.664
- You don't wanna sit?
- No, I just wanna stand here.

40:13.664 --> 40:15.832
- What time is it?
- Showtime, ladies and gentlemen!

40:15.832 --> 40:17.000
It's showtime!

40:17.709 --> 40:19.002
Oh, my God.

40:19.753 --> 40:22.756
- Yeah, I could ask them to stop the music.
- No, it's fine. Just leave it.

40:25.968 --> 40:28.512
You all right? You're doing good.

40:29.471 --> 40:30.639
Okay, I think I'm gonna puke.

40:30.639 --> 40:31.932
- I wanna sit.
- You wanna sit?

40:31.932 --> 40:33.016
- All right.
- Yeah.

40:42.109 --> 40:43.819
You doing good, all right.

40:43.819 --> 40:45.362
You're doing good. Okay?

40:45.863 --> 40:47.447
That guy's amazing!

40:47.447 --> 40:50.826
- Ten stops, that's it. Just ten stops.
- Okay.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.916
Why did you only eat bread?

40:57.916 --> 40:59.710
- The food was so good.
- Bread? I loved the bread.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.378
The bread was good. Brea--
It was delicious bread.

41:01.378 --> 41:04.089
It was the best bread-- What?

41:07.301 --> 41:09.595
It's all right.
You giving her trouble, aren't you?

41:10.095 --> 41:13.765
- Well, we can't wait to meet you.
- We can't wait to meet you.

41:13.765 --> 41:17.561
But you need to wait
about 15 minutes, baby. Okay? Fifteen.

41:24.067 --> 41:24.902
Okay.

41:24.902 --> 41:26.695
All right--

41:26.695 --> 41:29.198
Just stay with me.

41:29.198 --> 41:31.325
Just focus. Focus. It's okay.

41:31.325 --> 41:33.827
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
We're gonna get that fixed.

41:39.124 --> 41:40.125
Yo, what's up with your girl?

41:41.293 --> 41:42.544
Yo, she's pregnant.

41:43.962 --> 41:47.424
- It's happening now.
- Okay. She's having a baby right now.

41:47.424 --> 41:49.760
Can one of you guys
go find the conductor, please?

41:50.260 --> 41:52.679
Go get the conductor now!

41:52.679 --> 41:54.097
I'll go.

41:54.932 --> 41:56.308
- Please.
- Thank you.

41:58.769 --> 42:00.521
- What's your name?
- I'm Cowboy.

42:00.521 --> 42:02.564
I moved from Dallas
around ten years back with my parents,

42:02.564 --> 42:03.857
so everybody just calls me Cowboy now.

42:03.857 --> 42:06.109
- But my real name--
- Great. Cowboy, that's a great name.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.362
Can you do me a favor and help me
get my wife to her feet, please?

42:08.362 --> 42:09.738
- I got you.
- We're gonna go on three.

42:09.738 --> 42:12.074
You ready? One, two, three.
All right. Easy.

42:12.074 --> 42:14.284
- Easy. Easy.
- Fuck.

42:14.785 --> 42:16.495
- That's good. Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:16.495 --> 42:18.163
It's all right. Good job.

42:18.956 --> 42:21.375
- Yo, do you guys got something to drink?
- Red Bull?

42:22.125 --> 42:23.794
No. No.

42:24.545 --> 42:27.756
That water right there. Ma'am,
do you mind if I used that real quick?

42:27.756 --> 42:29.424
Thank you. Thank you so much.

42:29.424 --> 42:30.801
I got you. Here you go, babe.

42:30.801 --> 42:33.220
Here, there you go. That's it. Good.

42:34.054 --> 42:35.222
Come on, chug that water.

42:39.768 --> 42:40.602
Goddamn.

42:40.602 --> 42:42.729
Do you know
when this thing's gonna start moving?

42:43.313 --> 42:45.816
- Do you know when it's gonna start moving?
- We lost power on the third rail.

42:45.816 --> 42:46.900
This train ain't moving.

42:46.900 --> 42:50.195
I'll go back and radio to send EMTs,
but it's gonna take a while.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.073
It's all right.

42:58.912 --> 43:00.330
You and me, huh?

43:04.459 --> 43:05.586
Hey, it's okay.

43:05.586 --> 43:09.756
- I need to push now.
- It's okay. Okay. All right.

43:09.756 --> 43:10.883
All right. No problem.

43:10.883 --> 43:12.426
Hey, could you guys go?

43:12.426 --> 43:14.761
Just give us some privacy. Make sure
no one's looking at us, all right?

43:14.761 --> 43:16.805
- Just go away. Go!
- Yeah, I got you. Brian, get this end.

43:16.805 --> 43:17.890
I got this end. Come on.

43:17.890 --> 43:19.516
Here we go. You ready to go down?
You're ready.

43:19.516 --> 43:20.893
No showtime for you, ladies and gentlemen.

43:20.893 --> 43:24.021
Easy, easy. Slow. Slow.

43:24.521 --> 43:26.732
All right. There you go. You're good.

43:26.732 --> 43:28.317
You're good. All right.

43:28.317 --> 43:31.820
Now what I need you to do right now
is push for me, all right? Big breath.

43:32.988 --> 43:33.989
Come on.

43:34.531 --> 43:36.950
You got it. Come on, you got it. Good.

43:46.376 --> 43:48.545
One more. You got it.

43:48.545 --> 43:49.630
Come on.

43:51.215 --> 43:52.633
One more. One more, baby.

43:54.551 --> 43:55.552
There it is.

44:02.684 --> 44:04.019
Hey, hey.

44:06.063 --> 44:07.397
It's a boy.

44:09.691 --> 44:10.692
Hi.

44:12.236 --> 44:13.612
Should we name him Brian?

44:13.612 --> 44:15.072
I like that name.

44:15.739 --> 44:17.533
Can I-- I wanna touch him.

44:17.533 --> 44:18.617
Hey.

44:20.494 --> 44:23.080
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:23.580 --> 44:24.581
Hi.

44:26.875 --> 44:27.876
Hi.

44:30.754 --> 44:31.964
That's my baby.

44:36.093 --> 44:37.094
Hi.

44:38.595 --> 44:39.930
<i>First comes love.</i>

44:43.016 --> 44:44.518
<i>Then comes marriage.</i>

44:46.520 --> 44:48.856
<i>Then comes a baby in a baby carriage.</i>

44:50.023 --> 44:51.149
Get off me!

44:51.984 --> 44:54.444
<i>Tell me your journey, each of you.</i>

44:54.444 --> 44:58.991
<i>Tell me your life's voyage,
and I will tell you who you are.</i>

44:58.991 --> 45:03.453
- Apollo, you're coming with me.
- No!
