WEBVTT

00:01.927 --> 00:03.505
I remember raising my hand up

00:03.507 --> 00:04.772
and pulling back the curtains,

00:04.927 --> 00:07.045
and that's when I came
face-to-face

00:07.121 --> 00:09.652
with what we now know
as a Grey.

00:09.807 --> 00:12.152
Millions of people claiming

00:12.307 --> 00:16.485
to be abducted
by extraterrestrials.

00:16.541 --> 00:19.279
How many of you have had
an experience

00:19.281 --> 00:21.619
- of having been abducted?
- Wow.

00:21.794 --> 00:26.252
Ancient stories
of humans brought off planet

00:26.407 --> 00:28.399
by otherworldly beings.

00:28.421 --> 00:32.552
Angels, demons, spirits...

00:32.641 --> 00:35.565
are these the same
extraterrestrial entities

00:35.567 --> 00:39.079
who are interacting
with us today?

00:39.101 --> 00:44.039
My mother and I both had this
dreamlike experience

00:44.061 --> 00:45.739
of being taken to a craft.

00:45.894 --> 00:49.912
And I saw these
nonhuman entities.

00:49.914 --> 00:53.812
Could these incredible
stories really be true?

00:53.921 --> 00:58.185
And if so, why are humans
being taken?

00:58.241 --> 01:00.159
You have to ask yourself

01:00.334 --> 01:02.752
what is really going on here?
Because these cases

01:02.841 --> 01:05.364
simply defy explanation.

01:42.947 --> 01:47.259
June 16, 2018.

01:47.414 --> 01:50.859
Thousands of people from all
over the world gather

01:50.881 --> 01:53.165
for AlienCon,

01:53.321 --> 01:57.359
a three-day event to discuss
and explore the possibility

01:57.514 --> 02:01.259
that intelligent life exists
beyond our planet,

02:01.261 --> 02:04.792
and may have visited Earth
in the distant past.

02:04.794 --> 02:08.192
It's one thing for people to say

02:08.366 --> 02:11.285
that not only have they
seen a UFO,

02:11.287 --> 02:14.225
but they've had an experience,
a contact...

02:14.281 --> 02:15.612
During one panel
led by former

02:15.767 --> 02:18.845
Ministry of Defence
investigator Nick Pope,

02:18.847 --> 02:21.585
a group of experts talk about
a significant

02:21.587 --> 02:24.359
and controversial subject:

02:24.381 --> 02:26.885
alien abductions.

02:26.887 --> 02:28.959
Looking out at all of you,

02:29.134 --> 02:32.545
one of the things that we would
like to know is,

02:32.547 --> 02:37.012
how many of you have had
an experience you think

02:37.187 --> 02:39.239
might involve
having been abducted?

02:39.261 --> 02:43.779
Can you all put your hands up
who think that you have been?

02:45.361 --> 02:48.545
Wow, that's a lot of people.

02:48.601 --> 02:51.019
If anyone feels comfortable

02:51.194 --> 02:53.312
about coming up
to the microphone,

02:53.467 --> 02:56.985
we would love to hear
your stories.

02:57.161 --> 02:59.305
So, uh, please, yeah.

02:59.307 --> 03:00.479
My name's, uh, Alice Green.

03:00.634 --> 03:03.619
And, um, 40 years ago,

03:03.774 --> 03:08.219
uh, when I was 15, I, um,
I had an abduction experience.

03:08.261 --> 03:11.165
There was a huge spaceship
over my house,

03:11.167 --> 03:13.117
and, uh, one minute I'm in my
bed and the next minute

03:13.141 --> 03:14.932
I'm up in the spaceship.

03:15.087 --> 03:17.872
I wanted to call it a dream,

03:17.874 --> 03:19.772
because I didn't want to call it
an abduction experience

03:19.774 --> 03:22.219
for a long time.

03:22.221 --> 03:23.861
I started having
one of those experiences,

03:23.901 --> 03:29.859
out of body, but not just in
the vicinity.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.239
I kind of started entering
the space realm,

03:32.394 --> 03:34.812
and I just kept going.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.399
And it just got scarier
and scarier for me.

03:37.401 --> 03:39.339
I didn't know what was going on.

03:39.494 --> 03:40.919
The alien that I spoke to

03:41.074 --> 03:42.985
was about to my shoulder,

03:43.041 --> 03:44.645
maybe four and a half feet tall,

03:44.701 --> 03:46.352
and he had three fingers.

03:46.354 --> 03:49.819
He was like
your typical grey alien.

03:49.821 --> 03:51.310
And I had several encounters
over the course

03:51.334 --> 03:53.332
of the next couple years.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.319
I never wanted to tell anybody
because I thought my friends

03:55.341 --> 03:57.326
and family would think
I was crazy.

03:57.328 --> 03:58.739
Millions of people

03:58.894 --> 04:02.265
taken by
extraterrestrial beings?

04:02.267 --> 04:05.419
If alien abductions
are happening,

04:05.574 --> 04:08.339
as experiencers at this panel

04:08.341 --> 04:11.179
and many other
alleged abductees claim,

04:11.181 --> 04:14.499
what evidence is there
to support their stories?

04:14.521 --> 04:19.379
As the number of recorded
abduction cases has increased

04:19.401 --> 04:23.152
over the last several decades,
experts in a variety of fields

04:23.307 --> 04:26.819
have worked
to find this evidence.

04:26.821 --> 04:30.685
In 1991, my colleague
Budd Hopkins and I

04:30.687 --> 04:34.599
got funding for a national poll
about the abduction phenomenon

04:34.774 --> 04:36.985
through the Roper Organization.

04:37.161 --> 04:40.972
We found that at least two
percent of the American public,

04:41.127 --> 04:44.245
and at most, perhaps even five
percent of the American public,

04:44.401 --> 04:46.219
were abductees.

04:46.394 --> 04:50.252
Even with two percent, we're
dealing with an enormous number

04:50.254 --> 04:52.932
of people who've been abducted
throughout the world.

04:53.087 --> 04:55.319
Of course, when people
from the outside

04:55.474 --> 04:57.085
look at
the abduction phenomenon,

04:57.261 --> 05:00.099
they think that
this is just neurological.

05:00.121 --> 05:01.965
I wish that was the case.

05:02.141 --> 05:06.232
That would be wonderful
if that were the case.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.052
I can say, from having
interviewed now

05:09.207 --> 05:12.779
about 1,600 people
in the abduction syndrome,

05:12.801 --> 05:15.519
there are common denominators.

05:15.541 --> 05:20.739
I would say the vast majority
don't know details.

05:20.761 --> 05:24.625
They just remember pieces.

05:24.681 --> 05:27.999
They might remember,
"I saw these eyes,

05:28.021 --> 05:31.219
and they were big and black
and slanted."

05:31.374 --> 05:34.372
They will hear either
a buzzing sound,

05:34.527 --> 05:37.459
or there might be a clicking.

05:37.481 --> 05:41.105
Or in the room, there might be,
like, a little orb of light,

05:41.161 --> 05:43.265
or several orbs of light.

05:43.321 --> 05:46.419
They won't be able to move.

05:46.421 --> 05:50.485
And the paralysis is always
described the same way.

05:50.641 --> 05:54.785
They can move their eyes,
they can see.

05:54.841 --> 05:58.139
They can't move their head.

05:58.294 --> 06:02.979
They will say they see their
bedroom wall just disappear.

06:03.134 --> 06:06.105
Or they are taken
right through the wall.

06:06.261 --> 06:08.899
Or they're taken
through a window.

06:09.054 --> 06:12.245
Or they are taken
through the ceiling.

06:12.421 --> 06:16.305
And then 100% of people,

06:16.461 --> 06:21.645
their next consciousness is
waking up, often the sun is up,

06:21.801 --> 06:24.145
and they know
something's happened,

06:24.201 --> 06:26.352
but they don't know what.

06:26.461 --> 06:29.372
Well,
when you start adding it up

06:29.381 --> 06:31.252
across 40, 50,000 cases,

06:31.254 --> 06:33.145
the number one piece
of compelling evidence

06:33.301 --> 06:36.119
is the credibility
of the individual.

06:36.294 --> 06:39.405
We have doctors,
lawyers, politicians.

06:39.561 --> 06:42.432
So these are people
who have a lot at stake

06:42.434 --> 06:44.239
if they were to say,
"Hey, I've been abducted

06:44.394 --> 06:45.834
by an alien,"
or something like this,

06:45.927 --> 06:50.212
so you have to take
those people seriously.

06:50.367 --> 06:53.379
There are really only two
possibilities here.

06:53.381 --> 06:56.092
Either we're dealing
with a mass delusion

06:56.267 --> 06:59.519
on an unprecedented scale,

06:59.694 --> 07:05.119
or what these people are saying
is actually literally happening

07:05.274 --> 07:10.039
in a physical sense, and these
alien abductions are real.

07:13.207 --> 07:15.759
But if millions
of people have been abducted

07:15.914 --> 07:19.679
by extraterrestrials... or even
a fraction of that number...

07:19.834 --> 07:22.792
what could be
the reason behind it?

07:22.947 --> 07:24.492
And why now?

07:24.667 --> 07:28.119
While what we call
alien abductions

07:28.274 --> 07:31.285
may only have been reported
in modern times,

07:31.361 --> 07:34.532
ancient astronaut theorists
claim there is evidence

07:34.534 --> 07:36.632
that this phenomenon
has been happening

07:36.741 --> 07:39.265
for thousands of years.

07:39.441 --> 07:41.992
In ancient biblical texts,

07:41.994 --> 07:46.745
and also in other textual
references, we have accounts

07:46.747 --> 07:52.165
of people ascending and
descending from and to the sky

07:52.167 --> 07:57.659
with fiery chariots
and flying type of craft.

07:57.834 --> 08:02.085
And that to me indicates that
what these accounts refer to

08:02.087 --> 08:06.925
are similar
to modern-day abductions.

08:06.927 --> 08:09.865
Those accounts
are eyewitness accounts.

08:09.941 --> 08:13.099
They're not told
in the third person,

08:13.101 --> 08:15.545
but it's actually
"I, Ezekiel, witnessed."

08:15.701 --> 08:17.545
"I, Enoch, witnessed."

08:17.601 --> 08:19.185
"I, Abraham, did this."

08:19.187 --> 08:20.945
"I walked through there."

08:20.947 --> 08:26.072
Also, in ancient China,
and also, in ancient Egypt,

08:26.247 --> 08:29.319
are there stories of people
having been visited

08:29.494 --> 08:34.879
or having gone up to the sky to
visit with the so-called gods.

08:35.034 --> 08:40.924
What better way to describe
an extraterrestrial encounter?

08:41.081 --> 08:44.905
So today, we call it
an "alien abduction."

08:44.961 --> 08:50.765
In previous centuries, it was
called by different names.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.085
But we recognize
from the experience

08:53.241 --> 08:54.852
that they are identical.

08:55.027 --> 08:58.179
And therefore, it adds validity

08:58.354 --> 09:04.092
to this not being a modern myth,
but a very ancient problem.

09:04.201 --> 09:08.332
Why today, then,
is it such an important issue?

09:08.487 --> 09:11.172
It very well may be that we did
not recognize in the past

09:11.174 --> 09:13.665
how widespread
these experiences were.

09:13.667 --> 09:18.099
Or it could be that there
is a stepping up of the agenda,

09:18.254 --> 09:20.972
and that the experience
is spreading greater,

09:20.974 --> 09:23.339
farther and wider
than it was in the past.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.345
Could these
extraordinary accounts,

09:27.347 --> 09:31.812
both past and present, be
describing an ongoing program

09:31.967 --> 09:35.479
of human abduction,
in spite of the skepticism

09:35.634 --> 09:37.679
with which they are
viewed by the public?

09:39.714 --> 09:43.892
And is there a smoking gun
that will finally establish

09:44.047 --> 09:48.232
that this phenomenon is real,
and still underway?

09:48.387 --> 09:52.492
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

09:52.501 --> 09:55.859
one of the most well-documented
cases on record.

10:02.014 --> 10:04.979
Sheffield, Massachusetts.

10:05.001 --> 10:08.732
June 11, 2018.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.059
Well, we're pretty much
here now.

10:11.214 --> 10:14.299
Author and researcher Mike Bara

10:14.301 --> 10:17.939
has joined abduction experiencer
Thom Reed to visit the site

10:18.094 --> 10:22.825
where Thom says he and members
of his family were abducted

10:22.827 --> 10:27.485
after encountering a strange UFO
nearly 50 years ago.

10:27.487 --> 10:31.279
Does it evoke any memories or
emotions, bring back anything?

10:31.434 --> 10:32.479
Like an anxiety.

10:32.654 --> 10:34.632
- Really?
- Or nervousness I guess.

10:34.787 --> 10:37.445
The UFO was reportedly seen,

10:37.621 --> 10:39.959
not only by the Reed family,

10:40.114 --> 10:42.119
but also by multiple witnesses

10:42.121 --> 10:44.532
all across
Western Massachusetts.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.705
Okay. So, I guess here we are.

10:46.707 --> 10:49.212
- This is the spot, right?
- This is it.

10:49.367 --> 10:51.585
Can you kind of paint me
a picture of what was going on

10:51.761 --> 10:52.779
that night,
what happened the day

10:52.801 --> 10:54.219
- you drove up this road?
- Sure.

10:54.374 --> 10:55.957
Well, first of all,
it was, like, 90 degrees.

10:55.981 --> 10:57.450
It was a really hot night,
and there were

10:57.474 --> 10:58.754
an awful lot of families outside

10:58.801 --> 11:00.619
because it was Labor Day.

11:00.774 --> 11:03.679
It was September 1, 1969,
which was a Labor Day holiday.

11:03.681 --> 11:06.079
Okay. Can you describe what
people saw? I mean, did they see

11:06.081 --> 11:07.877
- just a light in the sky?
- They all saw something

11:07.901 --> 11:09.432
- a little bit different.
- What do you remember

11:09.434 --> 11:10.903
about what happened to you
and your family?

11:10.927 --> 11:12.439
There's a lot of time
that went by,

11:12.614 --> 11:14.392
and I only remember
little pieces of it.

11:14.394 --> 11:17.245
But, uh, we were coming
right down this road here,

11:17.247 --> 11:19.539
and we were heading
through the bridge.

11:19.694 --> 11:21.792
- Mm-hmm.
- And, uh, let-let me show you.

11:21.794 --> 11:23.865
- Okay. Sure.
- All right?

11:24.021 --> 11:27.419
At 9:00 p.m.
on the night of the sighting,

11:27.574 --> 11:30.599
ten-year-old Thom
and his mother, grandmother

11:30.641 --> 11:33.272
and brother were just minutes

11:33.274 --> 11:37.245
from getting home
when they crossed the bridge.

11:37.401 --> 11:39.650
Well, I was in the back seat
behind the driver, my mother.

11:39.674 --> 11:41.232
- Mm-hmm.
- And my grandmother,

11:41.387 --> 11:42.777
who was sitting
in the passenger seat,

11:42.801 --> 11:44.705
was the first one to notice
that there was a...

11:44.707 --> 11:46.699
an odd light
that didn't seem to make sense.

11:46.741 --> 11:50.132
There was a bleed of light
coming through the bridge.

11:50.307 --> 11:53.385
So light was coming
through places

11:53.387 --> 11:54.790
it should not have been
if it was just headlights.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.283
Yeah, it was coming
through the walls a little bit,

11:56.307 --> 11:58.319
coming through the floorboards.

11:58.494 --> 11:59.745
Then we exited the bridge.

11:59.901 --> 12:02.939
This is the spot right there.

12:03.114 --> 12:04.477
This is where
we first saw it, Mike.

12:04.501 --> 12:06.025
So, um,

12:06.181 --> 12:08.065
- can you describe what you saw?
- Yeah.

12:08.067 --> 12:10.665
It was like an orb,
if you would, or a sphere,

12:10.821 --> 12:14.379
and it was about, I'm gonna say
maybe 30, 40 yards round.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.692
It was a perfectly round sphere,

12:16.694 --> 12:19.765
and it had rods of light
that seemed to fire from it.

12:19.921 --> 12:23.445
So it looked like a shiver cone,
or an ice cream cone.

12:23.447 --> 12:26.692
So, none of you has ever seen
anything like this before?

12:26.694 --> 12:28.699
No, not like that, no.

12:28.741 --> 12:30.692
As Thom's mother continued

12:30.701 --> 12:32.692
driving slowly down the road,

12:32.847 --> 12:35.719
the object flew on a route
parallel to theirs

12:35.721 --> 12:40.339
until it took an abrupt turn,
cutting them off.

12:40.361 --> 12:42.699
The car comes to a stop,

12:42.701 --> 12:45.219
and there's a feeling
that came over the car,

12:45.374 --> 12:46.992
which was like a...
some type of a field.

12:47.147 --> 12:50.219
And we were just gone.
We aren't in the car anymore.

12:55.101 --> 12:58.905
And I remember seeing a light
or a door of some kind.

12:59.061 --> 13:01.092
And I was grabbed like this
on my left arm.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.892
And I was kind of pushed
towards this door.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.319
I went into the door.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.892
And I was sitting on...
almost like a-an autopsy table.

13:10.047 --> 13:12.805
And I saw what looked like

13:12.807 --> 13:16.079
some type of a large insect,
like an ant, if you will.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.072
Very stick-like legs,
bamboo almost.

13:19.227 --> 13:23.132
And that's what frightened me,
and then I was out.

13:23.134 --> 13:25.199
Then I remember waking
in the back of the car.

13:27.147 --> 13:31.845
If you could... remember

13:31.847 --> 13:34.499
every single detail,
every single thing that happened

13:34.654 --> 13:37.772
- to you, would you want to?
- I want to know,

13:37.774 --> 13:40.652
but at the same time,
I'm not sure I...

13:40.654 --> 13:42.865
that's a good thing
at this point.

13:43.021 --> 13:44.892
It's-it's confusing.

13:44.901 --> 13:48.125
You know, I kind of need to know
everything that happened,

13:48.127 --> 13:50.567
but at the same time, there's
really no way for me to do that.

13:52.781 --> 13:55.499
For years following
the reported event,

13:55.654 --> 13:57.859
a number of local authorities
and UFO investigators

13:58.014 --> 13:59.685
tried to find evidence

13:59.741 --> 14:04.379
that would validate the Reed
family's incredible account.

14:04.534 --> 14:08.245
One of these was a local judge
named Kevin Titus,

14:08.401 --> 14:11.905
who has spent decades
interviewing eyewitnesses

14:12.061 --> 14:14.685
and verifying their testimony.

14:14.861 --> 14:18.605
It is his belief that enough
evidence exists to conclude

14:18.681 --> 14:21.839
that something otherworldly did,
in fact,

14:21.841 --> 14:26.805
happen on that summer night
nearly 50 years ago.

14:26.807 --> 14:28.697
Everybody couldn't explain
what they were seeing.

14:28.721 --> 14:30.652
People were saying...
calling in WSBS radio,

14:30.807 --> 14:32.319
and telling them

14:32.474 --> 14:34.639
that there's something going on
over in this area.

14:34.814 --> 14:37.892
And, uh, nobody was able to

14:37.894 --> 14:41.419
completely say what it was,
but everybody saw it.

14:41.441 --> 14:43.959
There was well over 250 people
that called in.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.799
They were scared, hysterical.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.185
Some people couldn't explain
what they saw.

14:49.187 --> 14:51.279
They called the police.

14:51.434 --> 14:53.299
And they called
the Army Reserve Air Base.

14:53.341 --> 14:55.319
It's a fact, it did happen.

14:55.341 --> 14:58.179
When you have over 250 people
that saw something the same day,

14:58.221 --> 14:59.639
how can you say it wasn't true?

15:02.001 --> 15:04.792
Over 250 callers?

15:04.947 --> 15:10.779
And all reportedly seeing the
same unidentified flying object?

15:10.801 --> 15:14.092
For abduction researchers
and local authorities,

15:14.094 --> 15:16.792
the incredible number
of witnesses

15:16.794 --> 15:18.079
gave the Reed family's case

15:18.101 --> 15:21.879
an uncommonly high level
of credibility.

15:21.901 --> 15:27.092
So much so
that on November 3, 2015,

15:27.094 --> 15:31.605
Massachusetts Governor Charles
D. Baker issued a citation

15:31.761 --> 15:33.192
which formally recognized

15:33.367 --> 15:36.639
that a verified UFO event
had taken place,

15:36.661 --> 15:41.905
just as the Reed family
and many others had described.

15:42.061 --> 15:45.552
To date, no other
alien encounter has received

15:45.727 --> 15:49.405
this kind of acknowledgement.

15:49.481 --> 15:52.579
What I think is important
in all this is

15:52.601 --> 15:56.912
that we were the first to be
state-inducted as a true event.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.039
And I think that opens doors,
and paves the way for a lot

16:00.194 --> 16:02.479
of other people who deserve
to be taken more seriously.

16:04.007 --> 16:05.892
Do the verified accounts

16:05.981 --> 16:08.699
of the Sheffield incident
refute skeptics

16:08.854 --> 16:12.279
who claim that abduction stories
are unreliable?

16:12.454 --> 16:16.945
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and they suggest

16:17.101 --> 16:19.785
that even more compelling
evidence can be found

16:19.787 --> 16:25.459
by examining memories buried
deep inside... the human mind.

16:30.221 --> 16:32.559
At one of the AlienCon panels

16:32.714 --> 16:35.692
examining
alien abduction phenomena,

16:35.847 --> 16:38.565
a member of the audience shares
what he believes

16:38.567 --> 16:41.585
to have been
a real-life alien encounter,

16:41.661 --> 16:43.699
one involving missing time.

16:43.854 --> 16:46.085
In about 1996,

16:46.161 --> 16:50.212
I saw a UFO, and it scared me
bad enough that I called 911.

16:50.214 --> 16:52.179
And it just flew
around a water tower

16:52.201 --> 16:53.801
across the street from my house,
and went

16:53.954 --> 16:56.692
into Oak Riparian Park,
and, uh, I grabbed

16:56.694 --> 16:58.999
my flashlight. I wanted
to see it, and I chased it.

17:00.421 --> 17:02.005
And the next thing I remember,

17:02.161 --> 17:04.592
I'm-I'm walking back.
But I have this thing.

17:04.594 --> 17:06.332
Every time I go back
to that same park,

17:06.334 --> 17:08.679
I feel like
I'm missing something.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.512
It's a very common thing,

17:10.666 --> 17:13.204
missing time
with the abduction experience.

17:13.261 --> 17:17.079
And so, yeah, so, I've been
helping a lot of people going...

17:17.233 --> 17:19.299
you know,
go through the regression.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.845
There's different ways
that you can do regression,

17:21.901 --> 17:23.939
but I definitely encourage you
to do that.

17:24.094 --> 17:26.118
Caroline Cory is an expert

17:26.294 --> 17:29.799
in hypnotic regression...
a meditative practice used

17:29.821 --> 17:33.239
to release missing time memories
that have been suppressed,

17:33.241 --> 17:37.039
but are still present
in a person's subconscious mind.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.372
For the past 16 years,

17:39.547 --> 17:43.139
she has specialized in helping
people remember and understand

17:43.294 --> 17:45.532
what they believe
to be an incident

17:45.707 --> 17:48.179
involving extraterrestrial
abduction.

17:50.347 --> 17:52.805
When people have a trauma,

17:52.807 --> 17:57.819
they tend to push it back
into the subconscious mind,

17:57.861 --> 17:59.599
because, on a conscious level,

17:59.754 --> 18:03.872
it is associated with fear,
anxiety.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.819
Hypnotherapy allows you

18:06.974 --> 18:09.479
to bring the mind
to a certain level

18:09.654 --> 18:13.525
so that the person is
so relaxed,

18:13.681 --> 18:16.039
they're almost in a trance.

18:16.194 --> 18:18.079
Then they can tap
into their subconscious mind

18:18.234 --> 18:20.219
and relive the experience.

18:20.374 --> 18:22.792
When you relive the experience,
you...

18:22.801 --> 18:25.099
right away,
you begin to heal it.

18:25.121 --> 18:29.065
That is what happens
in hypnotherapy.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.019
- Hey, Joe. How are you?
- Hi, Caroline.

18:31.194 --> 18:34.472
On June 11, 2018,

18:34.481 --> 18:36.479
Caroline met with Joe Cerletti

18:36.634 --> 18:39.212
for a hypnotic
regression session.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.845
Joe has had difficulty
remembering the details

18:41.847 --> 18:45.772
of an incident that happened
in the spring of 2008,

18:45.861 --> 18:50.219
when he and two friends were
driving on a dark highway

18:50.241 --> 18:53.732
just after midnight
near Oakland, California.

18:53.734 --> 18:57.172
We were just driving down
the road at an average speed,

18:57.174 --> 19:01.445
65, maybe 70 miles an hour,
and instantaneously,

19:01.621 --> 19:04.492
we weren't driving anymore
and the car was shut off.

19:04.647 --> 19:08.245
And we were parked
about 45 minutes away

19:08.247 --> 19:11.752
in a parking lot for an
amusement park after hours

19:11.907 --> 19:14.385
and we were locked
inside the gate

19:14.541 --> 19:18.145
with no explanation how
we got there at that time.

19:18.147 --> 19:21.605
Joe realized
that he and his friends

19:21.761 --> 19:24.785
may have been abducted
by extraterrestrials,

19:24.961 --> 19:27.092
extraterrestrials
which he believes

19:27.267 --> 19:30.432
deliberately blocked his memory.

19:30.521 --> 19:33.865
Today, Caroline will use
hypnotic regression

19:33.867 --> 19:35.765
to hopefully help
Joe remember more

19:35.921 --> 19:37.805
about what happened
on that night.

19:37.961 --> 19:39.825
You ready?

19:39.981 --> 19:42.212
- I am.
- Okay, here we go.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.699
So, we're gonna sit up straight

19:44.701 --> 19:46.959
with the feet flat on the floor.

19:49.261 --> 19:52.619
And close your eyes.

19:52.621 --> 19:56.645
And take a deep breath
in through the nose.

19:56.821 --> 20:01.592
And exhale through the mouth.

20:01.747 --> 20:04.139
As you exhale...

20:04.294 --> 20:07.292
...you let go of the stress,
the tension.

20:07.447 --> 20:12.259
Focus on your hands,
on your arms...

20:12.414 --> 20:14.565
on your heart.

20:14.721 --> 20:18.405
We are now in the year 2008.

20:18.561 --> 20:23.359
You are driving
with two friends.

20:23.514 --> 20:27.052
And then what happens?

20:27.054 --> 20:29.899
A very bright flash of light

20:29.921 --> 20:31.779
just surrounds us
and absorbs us.

20:31.934 --> 20:33.945
Okay.

20:33.947 --> 20:35.372
I'm getting
these thoughts in my head

20:35.374 --> 20:36.799
that I've never heard before.

20:36.954 --> 20:39.639
- I'm trying to...
- Don't try.

20:39.794 --> 20:42.839
Don't assess or judge
or analyze.

20:42.994 --> 20:47.572
You are in the experience,
in the feeling.

20:47.574 --> 20:50.885
You feel safe, protected.

20:51.041 --> 20:56.639
And the light,
where is the light coming from?

20:56.641 --> 20:58.659
Almost like
a portal being opened.

20:58.814 --> 21:03.985
It's being opened by a ship.

21:04.041 --> 21:09.465
Okay. What is the next thing
that you experience?

21:09.641 --> 21:12.745
I'm starting to actually get
a visual of...

21:12.801 --> 21:15.312
guess you could call them faces.

21:15.314 --> 21:18.219
- Who's there?
- Just beings.

21:18.374 --> 21:23.379
Do you get a sense
of why you ended up there,

21:23.554 --> 21:25.525
not someone else?

21:25.527 --> 21:31.185
They're showing me just, like,
a line from my family.

21:31.341 --> 21:33.779
Goes,
they're just going back in time.

21:33.781 --> 21:37.532
They're saying that there's
always been a connection to,

21:37.687 --> 21:40.672
a close connection,
as far back as it goes.

21:40.827 --> 21:42.725
Okay.

21:42.727 --> 21:49.365
The biggest question that
the abductees have is, "Why me?"

21:49.367 --> 21:51.905
Why did this happen to me?"

21:52.061 --> 21:55.805
If they can sense that this
happened not just to them,

21:55.961 --> 21:58.179
but to their parents
and their grandparents,

21:58.334 --> 22:02.905
it brings some sort of closure,
it starts to make sense to them

22:03.081 --> 22:06.979
and they start to feel
that there's a real connection.

22:07.134 --> 22:09.132
It wasn't a random thing.

22:09.287 --> 22:10.999
Breathe in through the nose.

22:11.154 --> 22:14.345
As you exhale through the mouth,

22:14.501 --> 22:17.172
you're purging
all of this energy.

22:17.174 --> 22:19.159
Let it go, let it go, yes.

22:21.714 --> 22:27.779
And slowly, slowly, whenever
you're ready, open your eyes.

22:30.154 --> 22:32.939
Wow.

22:33.094 --> 22:34.125
- Excellent.
- Yeah.

22:34.127 --> 22:36.752
Wow.

22:36.907 --> 22:38.677
- Well, you did amazing. That was awesome.
- Thank you. - You did...

22:38.701 --> 22:41.372
- thank you so much.
- Absolutely.

22:41.527 --> 22:44.365
There was a time where
I was scared to find the answers

22:44.521 --> 22:47.472
because, I think,
the whole unknown factor

22:47.627 --> 22:50.972
is a basic human fear:
not knowing,

22:51.061 --> 22:53.959
the unknown, the abyss,
the dark.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.732
But I needed those answers
'cause I needed some sort of

22:56.907 --> 22:59.885
explanation for what happened
that night.

23:00.041 --> 23:01.637
- All right, I think we're done for today.
- Okay.

23:01.661 --> 23:04.725
For Joe Cerletti,
and others like him,

23:04.881 --> 23:07.605
hypnotic regression
is an important tool

23:07.661 --> 23:12.352
in unlocking memories that may
be buried due to trauma.

23:12.354 --> 23:15.485
But are there other,
even more authoritative methods,

23:15.641 --> 23:21.739
that might help prove that alien
abductions actually take place?

23:21.761 --> 23:24.472
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

23:24.474 --> 23:27.085
and point to recent experiments
that collect

23:27.241 --> 23:31.179
convincing scientific data
from the human brain.

23:38.894 --> 23:43.245
Of the featured guests
at AlienCon 2018,

23:43.247 --> 23:46.105
three claim to have had
firsthand experience

23:46.107 --> 23:48.592
with extraterrestrials:

23:48.594 --> 23:52.172
consciousness researcher
Caroline Cory,

23:52.174 --> 23:56.745
Kathleen Marden, the director of
Experiencer Research for MUFON,

23:56.901 --> 23:59.232
the Mutual UFO Network,

23:59.387 --> 24:03.005
and Bret Oldham,
a man who claims to have had

24:03.007 --> 24:04.859
more than a dozen
abduction experiences

24:04.881 --> 24:06.939
since the age of five.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.592
So many, in fact,

24:08.747 --> 24:12.125
that he has authored
three books on the subject.

24:12.281 --> 24:15.072
Uh, I was first taken
when I was five years old,

24:15.074 --> 24:17.525
and the memories were suppressed

24:17.527 --> 24:19.779
all the way up
until I was in my early 20s.

24:19.934 --> 24:23.325
And it was through the therapy
that I discovered the truth

24:23.327 --> 24:25.292
of what had been
happening to me.

24:25.294 --> 24:27.205
The psychological damage
of being taken

24:27.207 --> 24:30.099
and having sexual experiments
performed on you,

24:30.101 --> 24:32.245
and being subjected to a lot
of things like that.

24:32.401 --> 24:34.525
I decided not to become
a victim to it.

24:34.581 --> 24:40.579
And it took me 20, 20 some years
to get enough nerve

24:40.581 --> 24:43.205
to come forward and face
what was out there,

24:43.381 --> 24:45.052
because I wanted
to become a voice

24:45.207 --> 24:47.132
for others who have had
these experiences.

24:47.287 --> 24:51.645
For more than a decade,
Bret Oldham has been an advocate

24:51.801 --> 24:55.499
for those who claim to have
had similar experiences.

24:55.674 --> 24:58.032
Like all abductees, he has faced

24:58.187 --> 25:02.292
both skepticism and scorn
from the public.

25:02.294 --> 25:04.145
This is a worldwide phenomena,
it's happening

25:04.147 --> 25:08.592
in a grand scale and it's
happening to all walks of life.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.499
Thank you very much.

25:17.521 --> 25:19.892
Earlier this year,
in an effort to learn

25:19.894 --> 25:22.119
if his abduction memories

25:22.121 --> 25:24.319
could be clinically proven,
Bret agreed

25:24.341 --> 25:27.785
to submit to a scientific test.

25:27.841 --> 25:30.552
- Why don't you come on back?
- Sure. -Great, thanks.

25:30.707 --> 25:32.945
If successful, the test,

25:33.021 --> 25:36.245
involving an EEG scan
of Bret's brain,

25:36.301 --> 25:38.139
could go a long way

25:38.294 --> 25:40.805
toward proving that
extraterrestrial abductions

25:40.807 --> 25:43.932
are actually taking place.

25:44.087 --> 25:48.799
Conducting the test is
neuroscientist Dr. Dario Nardi,

25:48.954 --> 25:50.465
under the supervision

25:50.541 --> 25:55.005
of former British Ministry of
Defence investigator, Nick Pope.

25:55.007 --> 25:58.039
Okay, we will be using, um, this
little piece of equipment today.

25:58.194 --> 25:59.899
Are you familiar with EEG?

26:00.074 --> 26:01.425
I'm familiar with it.

26:01.427 --> 26:02.627
There are no wires or whatnot,

26:02.754 --> 26:04.339
there's just these
little sensors.

26:04.341 --> 26:06.905
And I will be placing this
on your head like this.

26:07.061 --> 26:09.219
Okay.

26:09.374 --> 26:13.019
An EEG,
or electroencephalography,

26:13.061 --> 26:15.119
is a noninvasive method
of measuring

26:15.141 --> 26:19.179
the electrochemical activity
of the neurons in the brain.

26:19.181 --> 26:22.399
It works by placing
a network of electrodes

26:22.554 --> 26:25.779
over areas of the scalp,
which can, in turn, register

26:25.934 --> 26:28.819
not only the area of the brain
that is being stimulated,

26:28.974 --> 26:32.852
but also the degree
of stimulation.

26:33.007 --> 26:34.283
We can make a couple
of inferences

26:34.307 --> 26:35.885
when we see the brain activity.

26:35.961 --> 26:39.379
One is, if we see
what are called alpha waves

26:39.554 --> 26:43.059
in particular, in the temporal
regions of the brain,

26:43.214 --> 26:45.119
then that's gonna give us
a good idea

26:45.121 --> 26:48.312
that the person is recalling
something from memory.

26:48.314 --> 26:51.665
On the other hand,
if we see, uh, activity more

26:51.721 --> 26:53.579
in the front of the brain,

26:53.581 --> 26:55.579
where there's maybe not
those alpha waves

26:55.734 --> 26:57.672
of some other kind of activity,

26:57.761 --> 27:01.325
then that's gonna suggest that
the person is crafting something

27:01.501 --> 27:04.672
or coming up with an answer
or explanation in the moment.

27:04.781 --> 27:07.112
So we can differentiate sort of

27:07.114 --> 27:10.432
storytelling versus
accessing the memory.

27:10.434 --> 27:13.652
Nick will ask Bret
a series of questions

27:13.807 --> 27:16.405
about his abduction experiences,

27:16.561 --> 27:19.599
and Dr. Nardi will observe
the neural activity

27:19.754 --> 27:22.545
that occurs
during Bret's responses.

27:22.701 --> 27:26.165
If, for example,
Bret is inventing or making up

27:26.321 --> 27:29.365
his answers,
it should show up as activity

27:29.521 --> 27:33.719
on the part of the brain most
associated with imagination.

27:35.181 --> 27:38.452
Okay. We are ready to go.

27:38.454 --> 27:41.419
Well, perhaps, uh,
first of all, Bret,

27:41.421 --> 27:43.639
was there a single incident
that started this?

27:43.641 --> 27:45.285
Uh, there was.

27:45.287 --> 27:47.859
Um, we lived
in Southern Illinois,

27:48.014 --> 27:53.272
in an old farmhouse surrounded
by just cornfields and soybean

27:53.361 --> 27:55.852
and stuff like that, and
I'd lived a pretty innocent life

27:56.007 --> 27:57.739
up until that point.

27:57.894 --> 28:00.645
One night, I heard a voice,

28:00.801 --> 28:03.125
and I actually thought
it was my stepdad,

28:03.281 --> 28:06.439
'cause it's very, very quiet
out in the country.

28:06.461 --> 28:08.139
Did the voice say something?

28:08.141 --> 28:11.572
The voice was coaxing me
to come to the window.

28:11.681 --> 28:15.725
I got up
and I walked across the floor.

28:15.881 --> 28:18.012
I could see a light
coming through.

28:18.187 --> 28:20.752
It just kept coaxing me to come,

28:20.841 --> 28:23.525
and I was just
a curious little boy.

28:23.681 --> 28:25.392
And I remember
raising my hand up

28:25.547 --> 28:28.405
and pulling back the curtains,

28:28.407 --> 28:30.492
and that's when I came
face-to-face

28:30.494 --> 28:32.439
with what we now know as a Grey.

28:35.774 --> 28:38.519
- So what did you think it was?
- I had no idea.

28:38.674 --> 28:40.479
I had never seen anything
like that before.

28:40.634 --> 28:44.812
And before I could scream
for help or anything,

28:44.987 --> 28:48.332
the next thing I remember
was laying on a table,

28:48.487 --> 28:51.252
surrounded by these things.

28:51.261 --> 28:54.152
And you said, uh,
before you could scream,

28:54.154 --> 28:55.619
so I presume
from what you're saying

28:55.621 --> 28:58.359
- that you were very scared.
- Very scared.

28:58.361 --> 29:01.392
That first incident made such
an indelible mark in my psyche

29:01.547 --> 29:03.539
that I-I had
nightmares about it,

29:03.694 --> 29:06.192
up until just several years ago.

29:06.347 --> 29:08.639
Even now, after all the time,

29:08.641 --> 29:12.132
how does it make you feel
looking back on that incident

29:12.134 --> 29:15.119
and what's your,
what's your bottom line on this,

29:15.274 --> 29:18.199
in terms of what you think's
going on?

29:18.201 --> 29:21.285
I don't think anyone really
knows what their true agenda is.

29:21.441 --> 29:23.239
You know, some people speculate

29:23.241 --> 29:24.737
that they're gonna
take over our planet.

29:24.761 --> 29:26.165
Uh, I don't.

29:26.321 --> 29:27.765
I-I think if they were
gonna do that,

29:27.941 --> 29:30.405
- they would have already done it.
- Right.

29:30.461 --> 29:33.532
After Nick and Bret
finish their session,

29:33.534 --> 29:36.679
Dr. Nardi shares
the EEG results,

29:36.834 --> 29:40.625
and what they reveal
about Bret and his story.

29:40.627 --> 29:46.665
So we had about
45 minutes worth of data.

29:46.821 --> 29:50.419
You asked questions that truly
were speculative questions,

29:50.421 --> 29:52.719
versus ones that were asking
for literal recall.

29:52.721 --> 29:54.799
And we saw that, really,
they were activating

29:54.821 --> 29:57.559
in very different parts
of the brain.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.352
Consistently,
when you asked him to speculate,

30:00.354 --> 30:02.492
like, "Why do you think
that they do this,"

30:02.647 --> 30:04.485
then clearly, we see
this region of the brain

30:04.541 --> 30:07.232
in the left hemisphere sort
of by the left temple here,

30:07.407 --> 30:09.185
that that would get active.

30:09.187 --> 30:11.532
So that, that was
a really good baseline.

30:11.534 --> 30:15.865
In contrast, there were
at least a half a dozen moments

30:15.921 --> 30:19.459
which really strongly activated
over on this side instead,

30:19.461 --> 30:23.232
which is associated more
with literal recall.

30:23.234 --> 30:26.139
In other words, uh,
we're just gonna give the facts,

30:26.294 --> 30:29.185
and the details, or rather,
recall without embellishment.

30:29.341 --> 30:32.079
Indicative of an actual memory?

30:32.234 --> 30:33.345
Most of the time.

30:33.501 --> 30:36.665
"Recall without embellishment?"

30:36.741 --> 30:41.712
Could this result be evidence
that Bret's story is true,

30:41.714 --> 30:44.739
and that these abductions
really took place?

30:44.741 --> 30:49.185
Those moments that you described
like sitting with the tall Grey,

30:49.187 --> 30:52.292
that's what that
looked like in the brain.

30:52.467 --> 30:56.179
By differentiating between
memory and speculation,

30:56.334 --> 31:01.899
in one sense the EEG machine
acted as a sort of polygraph.

31:02.054 --> 31:04.945
The fact that the part
of the brain involved in memory

31:05.121 --> 31:07.259
lit up and was activated,

31:07.261 --> 31:12.279
says to me that this
is a genuine experience.

31:12.321 --> 31:14.565
This is not a hoax.

31:14.567 --> 31:17.825
This is not somebody who's
making the whole thing up.

31:17.981 --> 31:19.261
Well, Dario,
thank you very much.

31:19.394 --> 31:21.059
This has been very interesting,

31:21.214 --> 31:22.790
and I think we've got
lots of great data here.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.665
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

31:24.821 --> 31:26.745
- It's my pleasure.
- Really appreciate it.

31:26.901 --> 31:28.617
The journey is always
going to continue for me.

31:28.641 --> 31:32.139
I'm always going to want to
delve deeper into these events,

31:32.161 --> 31:36.119
into what I remember, and
find out what I don't remember.

31:36.274 --> 31:39.639
And I still don't have
all the answers.

31:39.794 --> 31:42.999
If, as the EEG data suggests,

31:43.174 --> 31:44.939
Bret Oldham's claims

31:45.094 --> 31:47.319
of extraterrestrial
abduction are true,

31:47.341 --> 31:51.865
does it help prove that alien
abductions are really happening?

31:51.941 --> 31:54.352
But why?

31:54.527 --> 31:57.685
And for what purpose?

31:57.841 --> 32:01.579
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining evidence

32:01.621 --> 32:04.932
that aliens have been altering
human biology.

32:05.107 --> 32:10.239
And not just for generations,
but for thousands of years.

32:16.134 --> 32:18.225
Lancaster, New Hampshire.

32:18.227 --> 32:21.745
September 19, 1961.

32:21.801 --> 32:26.092
Betty and Barney Hill
are driving late at night

32:26.101 --> 32:28.485
when a large flying saucer
intercepts them

32:28.661 --> 32:31.872
and hovers over their car.

32:31.874 --> 32:34.025
Above them, the Hills observe

32:34.201 --> 32:38.212
otherworldly figures
in the windows of the craft.

32:38.214 --> 32:42.672
Days later, the couple
reports missing time

32:42.674 --> 32:45.279
and after participating
in hypnotic regression,

32:45.434 --> 32:47.279
they claim to realize

32:47.434 --> 32:50.592
that they were abducted
by extraterrestrials.

32:50.594 --> 32:55.605
In the decades that follow,
the Betty and Barney Hill case

32:55.761 --> 32:58.952
becomes the most well-known and
investigated abduction encounter

32:59.041 --> 33:00.719
in modern history.

33:00.761 --> 33:04.145
But according to Betty
and Barney's descendants,

33:04.147 --> 33:07.399
the incident in Lancaster
is only one part

33:07.554 --> 33:09.799
of a much larger story,

33:09.954 --> 33:13.325
a story that actually
began three years prior

33:13.401 --> 33:16.985
with an incident
involving Betty's sister.

33:16.987 --> 33:21.532
Betty Hill was my aunt,
my mother's sister.

33:21.534 --> 33:25.825
Something that we have
never revealed before

33:25.827 --> 33:30.505
is that my mother had
a close encounter in 1958.

33:30.581 --> 33:34.452
She saw this huge,
cigar-shaped craft

33:34.627 --> 33:36.972
hovering over a field.

33:37.127 --> 33:42.485
She had no explanation for what
had happened as far as she knew.

33:42.641 --> 33:46.172
She had gone shopping
and she had driven home.

33:46.327 --> 33:50.685
My mother eventually
underwent hypnosis

33:50.687 --> 33:54.225
and through hypnosis,
she recalled

33:54.381 --> 33:57.019
having been abducted as well.

33:57.174 --> 34:01.392
And I also had this uncanny

34:01.481 --> 34:03.492
sort of dreamlike experience

34:03.494 --> 34:06.312
of being taken to a craft.

34:06.467 --> 34:10.018
It bothered me
for many, many years.

34:10.174 --> 34:14.331
Eventually, I did talk
to my family about it

34:14.333 --> 34:18.379
and that's when I found out that
my mother had the same memory.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.458
Could it be
that extraterrestrial beings

34:21.614 --> 34:24.572
are abducting
not only individuals,

34:24.681 --> 34:26.438
but also families?

34:26.460 --> 34:29.752
And if so, why?

34:29.754 --> 34:32.445
The abduction phenomenon
is intergenerational.

34:32.621 --> 34:34.712
When a man and a woman marry

34:34.867 --> 34:37.559
and either the man
or the woman is an abductee,

34:37.714 --> 34:40.225
their children
will be abductees.

34:40.226 --> 34:45.445
It seems that specific
bloodlines are involved here.

34:45.601 --> 34:47.784
And if that's the case,

34:47.786 --> 34:50.612
it raises
the intriguing possibility

34:50.766 --> 34:54.772
that the extraterrestrials are
interested in human biology,

34:54.927 --> 34:57.799
that they are monitoring
specific genetic lines

34:57.821 --> 34:59.739
for some purpose.

34:59.914 --> 35:04.445
For ancient astronaut
theorists and UFO researchers,

35:04.601 --> 35:07.105
the notion that
extraterrestrials

35:07.181 --> 35:09.992
are conducting experiments
involving human biology

35:10.101 --> 35:11.659
is not a new one.

35:11.814 --> 35:14.705
Many believe the practice
has been going on

35:14.861 --> 35:18.759
for thousands of years.

35:18.914 --> 35:21.272
Maybe there's some truth
to these entities

35:21.427 --> 35:23.419
which we call <i> shedim.</i>

35:23.574 --> 35:25.312
These are old legends

35:25.467 --> 35:29.812
of people who are abducted,
sexually seduced

35:29.967 --> 35:33.279
and some taken away.

35:33.434 --> 35:36.145
And when we hear today
about the numerous stories

35:36.301 --> 35:39.619
of alien abductions
throughout history,

35:39.621 --> 35:41.952
they are identical.

35:42.107 --> 35:44.119
For proof that their theories

35:44.274 --> 35:48.025
about the biological nature
of alien abductions are valid,

35:48.081 --> 35:50.125
researchers point to the fact

35:50.127 --> 35:54.479
that a relatively high number
of abductees, more than 60%,

35:54.521 --> 35:57.545
have an extraordinarily
rare blood type:

35:57.601 --> 36:00.559
Rh negative.

36:00.714 --> 36:05.805
The subject kept coming up from
the abductees: "I'm Rh negative."

36:05.807 --> 36:09.419
"Could it have anything to do
with why I'm being abducted?"

36:09.441 --> 36:15.039
I got to collaborate with a
doctor, Dr. John Altshuler,

36:15.214 --> 36:19.225
and he did pathology;
he did blood work.

36:19.281 --> 36:24.605
And he gave the conclusion
that Rh negative blood

36:24.761 --> 36:29.645
might actually be
a genetic data point

36:29.721 --> 36:35.539
about why humans
could be hybrids,

36:35.541 --> 36:38.405
that every Rh negative

36:38.581 --> 36:41.932
would be coming
from a history of abductions.

36:42.107 --> 36:45.985
Rh negative
is a very peculiar thing.

36:45.987 --> 36:49.172
First off, it didn't exist
until 35,000 years ago.

36:49.347 --> 36:52.159
It may have been
that 35,000 years ago,

36:52.201 --> 36:54.259
E.T. introduced this
into our society

36:54.414 --> 36:57.319
through whatever breeding
programs they've been running.

36:57.321 --> 37:00.199
The ancient astronaut
theory suggests

37:00.354 --> 37:03.199
that for thousands of years,

37:03.201 --> 37:05.879
extraterrestrials
meddled with our DNA.

37:05.921 --> 37:10.685
There was a time when
we were <i> Homo sapiens.</i>

37:10.861 --> 37:14.205
And then we became
<i>Homo sapiens sapiens.</i>

37:14.361 --> 37:17.659
And that happened
within only 50,000 years,

37:17.814 --> 37:20.719
which by Darwinian
evolutionary standards,

37:20.874 --> 37:24.745
is too short of a time span
for that to happen.

37:24.901 --> 37:29.672
Our brain volume increased
by up to 30%

37:29.847 --> 37:32.939
in 50,000 years,
which is absolutely crazy.

37:33.094 --> 37:35.972
Now, the reason why I think

37:36.127 --> 37:39.232
that modern-day abductions occur

37:39.321 --> 37:44.659
is because maybe we are still
being manipulated with our DNA

37:44.661 --> 37:46.692
from extraterrestrials

37:46.781 --> 37:50.185
in order to turn us
from <i> Homo sapiens sapiens</i>

37:50.261 --> 37:54.139
into <i> Homo sapiens</i>
<i>sapiens sapiens.</i>

37:54.181 --> 37:57.919
Have extraterrestrials
been abducting people

37:58.094 --> 38:01.752
in order to monitor the
evolutionary progress of humans?

38:01.841 --> 38:06.099
Or have they been deliberately
manipulating our biology

38:06.254 --> 38:09.012
in order to achieve
some ultimate purpose?

38:09.167 --> 38:12.305
Ancient astronaut
theorists claim

38:12.307 --> 38:16.405
that both possibilities are
likely true and for this reason,

38:16.561 --> 38:20.605
it is more important than ever
for us to hear the stories

38:20.661 --> 38:24.159
of those who say
they have been taken.

38:29.894 --> 38:31.759
Pasadena, California.

38:31.914 --> 38:36.252
June 16, 2018.

38:36.261 --> 38:40.165
Throughout a discussion
about alien abductions

38:40.321 --> 38:42.079
during a panel at AlienCon,

38:42.254 --> 38:45.885
both the panelists
and members of the audience

38:45.887 --> 38:48.592
remark on how difficult,
but also important it is

38:48.747 --> 38:51.972
to speak out about abductions.

38:52.127 --> 38:55.239
I hesitated coming up here
for a couple reasons.

38:55.414 --> 38:58.812
Um...

38:58.967 --> 39:02.899
Every topic
that you guys have mentioned

39:03.074 --> 39:06.239
has connected dots
actively right now today.

39:06.394 --> 39:09.359
As far as lineage,
as far as bloodlines,

39:09.361 --> 39:11.105
as far as families,
so generational.

39:11.161 --> 39:14.645
My mom, um, myself, my daughter.

39:14.647 --> 39:16.185
I had night terrors as a child,

39:16.361 --> 39:18.532
missing time as a child
throughout my life.

39:18.534 --> 39:21.205
I literally have
short-term memory deficits

39:21.261 --> 39:25.059
and specific things,
real spontaneous phenomenon

39:25.214 --> 39:27.705
that ultimately touches
on everything that

39:27.861 --> 39:29.901
- you guys are talking about.
- Thank you very much.

39:30.014 --> 39:32.679
These hardly ever seem
to be one-off experiences.

39:32.854 --> 39:34.319
Thank you
for sharing your story.

39:37.354 --> 39:39.939
I'd like to say, uh, I applaud
you guys for your courage

39:40.094 --> 39:41.490
to come forward in front
of all these people

39:41.514 --> 39:42.779
and share your story.

39:42.934 --> 39:45.112
I'm blown away
by the amount of people

39:45.267 --> 39:47.072
that, uh, show up at this panel.

39:47.227 --> 39:50.025
And when I see this kind of, uh,
support, it's very encouraging

39:50.181 --> 39:51.532
and I think
that's very important

39:51.687 --> 39:53.932
to bring this phenomenon
out into the light

39:53.934 --> 39:55.865
where it needs to be
because a lot of answers

39:55.867 --> 39:57.645
lie with the experiencers.

39:57.821 --> 39:59.079
So I just thank you for that.

40:04.681 --> 40:08.165
Coming forward to admit
that you've had some type

40:08.321 --> 40:11.892
of a close encounter,
whether it is seeing something

40:11.901 --> 40:14.112
or maybe you've been abducted,

40:14.267 --> 40:17.039
that is a very difficult
thing to admit.

40:17.194 --> 40:20.599
And that is why I think

40:20.774 --> 40:24.285
we really should look at all
the other pieces of evidence:

40:24.287 --> 40:27.699
abduction cases
or close encounters

40:27.854 --> 40:30.392
and say, "Okay, what if?"

40:30.394 --> 40:34.372
I'm happy today that
I'm finally able to say

40:34.527 --> 40:37.699
it's not only real,
it's happening.

40:37.701 --> 40:41.065
Great. Hearing those stories
is of help

40:41.067 --> 40:44.765
to any of you out there who have
had these strange experiences.

40:44.921 --> 40:47.119
And you are not alone with this,
as you can see.

40:47.121 --> 40:50.639
So thank you to you and thank
you to my fellow panelists.

40:50.794 --> 40:55.139
When you look
at the vast body of data

40:55.294 --> 40:57.785
that we have on this phenomenon,

40:57.961 --> 40:59.732
it's difficult
to avoid the conclusion

40:59.907 --> 41:01.725
that something is going on here.

41:01.781 --> 41:03.799
Why should we, therefore,

41:03.954 --> 41:06.959
cast away the stories
of the abductees

41:06.981 --> 41:09.619
just because we may feel
a little uncomfortable

41:09.774 --> 41:11.539
with the place that takes us?

41:13.701 --> 41:15.992
Each year, thousands of people

41:16.147 --> 41:18.225
are bravely coming forward

41:18.301 --> 41:21.645
with personal accounts
of alien abductions.

41:21.821 --> 41:24.372
But is the world's
growing willingness

41:24.527 --> 41:27.352
to hear them and
believe them a sign

41:27.354 --> 41:29.559
that humanity
might be on the brink

41:29.714 --> 41:33.439
of an exciting new period
in its evolution,

41:33.481 --> 41:38.352
one where we will discover
that centuries of alien contact

41:38.361 --> 41:40.919
has changed us in ways
we could never

41:40.941 --> 41:43.545
have previously imagined
or accepted?

41:43.601 --> 41:47.332
Perhaps a greater acceptance

41:47.487 --> 41:49.645
that alien contact is being made

41:49.801 --> 41:52.259
will prepare us for the future,

41:52.281 --> 41:56.019
a future where we will become

41:56.041 --> 41:59.559
the extraterrestrials
on other worlds

41:59.714 --> 42:04.879
and encounter other life-forms
not so different from our own.
