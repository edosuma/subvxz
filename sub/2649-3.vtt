WEBVTT

00:02.004 --> 00:04.590
Jay.

00:06.258 --> 00:08.051
Jay. What? What's wrong?

00:08.177 --> 00:10.762
You're snoring.
Me?

00:10.846 --> 00:13.098
Oh, I'm sorry. I-

00:13.182 --> 00:15.184
Hey.

00:15.267 --> 00:17.561
Look at her.

00:17.644 --> 00:20.022
Come on. We said
no Stella in the bed.

00:20.105 --> 00:21.690
Oh, but she's just
a little puppy.

00:21.773 --> 00:23.942
She probably got scared
and snuck in.

00:24.026 --> 00:25.652
Oh, really? How come when
Manny has nightmares,

00:25.736 --> 00:27.362
you don't let him
snuck in the bed?

00:27.446 --> 00:29.865
Gloria, it's 6:00 in the morning.
Can we talk about this later?

00:31.325 --> 00:33.619
Answer the question, Jay.

00:36.079 --> 00:38.207
You know, I'm going to check the lease,
but I'm pretty sure...

00:38.290 --> 00:39.791
we're not allowed to have
a meth lab.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.335
You are a delight.

00:41.460 --> 00:43.795
So what are you doing? I think
you're gonna like this.

00:43.879 --> 00:45.714
I'm going on a juice fast.

00:45.797 --> 00:47.341
Mmm.
Love it.

00:47.424 --> 00:48.926
Hate it.

00:49.009 --> 00:53.263
Let's face it. A well-fed Cam is
hardly a model of emotional stability.

00:53.347 --> 00:55.057
Now, deprive him of food,

00:55.140 --> 00:58.560
and stage by stage, it's
a slow descent into madness.

00:58.644 --> 01:00.646
Stage one- the clean sweep.

01:01.563 --> 01:05.191
Poison. Poison. Poison.

01:05.316 --> 01:08.487
Do you think this is the best
week to be doing this? Why not?

01:08.570 --> 01:10.656
Well, we have that charity thing
at my boss's house.

01:10.739 --> 01:12.741
So what? I'm supposed to
put off my quest for wellness...

01:12.824 --> 01:14.534
until we're no longer
socially in demand?

01:14.618 --> 01:16.662
That will never happen.
I'm too charismatic.

01:16.745 --> 01:18.205
No. No, not the cookies!

01:18.288 --> 01:20.290
Of course the cookies.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.168
Why do you always
want me to fail?

01:23.252 --> 01:25.170
Stage two- attack Mitchell,

01:25.254 --> 01:27.923
because when his diet
crashes and burns...

01:28.006 --> 01:30.008
into a giant pile of Nutella,

01:30.092 --> 01:31.593
I'm the one
he's going to blame.

01:31.677 --> 01:33.428
Well, no, not this time.

01:33.512 --> 01:35.389
You know what?
I'm gonna do the fast with you.

01:35.472 --> 01:37.224
I think it's a great idea.

01:37.307 --> 01:39.309
And we should do it together,
so we're on the same team.

01:39.393 --> 01:40.894
You know, us versus food.

01:40.978 --> 01:42.938
I know what you're doing.

01:43.021 --> 01:44.606
And I really appreciate it.

01:44.690 --> 01:47.276
Oh, no. It'll-
it'll be good for me.

01:47.359 --> 01:48.860
I've actually
put on a few pounds, so-

01:48.944 --> 01:50.737
Yeah, well- I didn't
want to say anything.

01:55.993 --> 01:58.829
As the stock market plummeted,

01:58.912 --> 02:01.331
brave young men
took to the skies,

02:01.415 --> 02:05.585
ushering in
the golden age of the daredevil.

02:05.669 --> 02:07.629
How awesome are people?

02:07.713 --> 02:10.173
So awesome.

02:10.257 --> 02:13.010
You want
to get that, buddy? I'll pause it

02:14.386 --> 02:15.887
Hey, Luke.
How's it goin'?

02:15.971 --> 02:18.473
Hey, Uncle Mitchell. I really can't talk.
I'm tryin' to watch a movie.

02:18.557 --> 02:21.518
Oh, okay. Well, I just wanted to
drop off this bag of junk food.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.020
Go on.

02:23.103 --> 02:25.856
Uh, Cam and I
are on a juice fast,

02:25.939 --> 02:27.441
so having the stuff
in the house just-

02:27.524 --> 02:29.735
I connected the dots.
See ya.

02:29.818 --> 02:30.902
Uh-

02:36.575 --> 02:41.038
Seeing that weird, wonderful little man
pursuing his dream of walking on a tightrope...

02:41.121 --> 02:44.541
made me think maybe I
could pursue my dream.

02:44.624 --> 02:46.293
There you go, buddy.

02:50.339 --> 02:52.507
Of walking on a tightrope.

02:53.342 --> 02:55.177
# Hey, hey #

02:55.260 --> 02:57.304
# Hey, hey #

02:57.387 --> 02:59.389
# Hey, hey #

02:59.473 --> 03:01.350
# Hey, hey #

03:01.433 --> 03:02.601
# Hey ##

03:05.103 --> 03:07.522
Come on, Dad! You got this!
You can do this!

03:07.606 --> 03:09.066
Stay focused,
stay hungry!

03:09.191 --> 03:10.692
You okay, buddy?
What? Yeah!

03:10.776 --> 03:13.028
Yeah, no, just proud of my dad!

03:13.111 --> 03:15.280
There was a lot of chocolate
in that bag.

03:16.406 --> 03:19.451
Phil- Honey, you gotta
take Luke to school.

03:19.534 --> 03:20.827
Got it.

03:20.911 --> 03:23.663
Okay, I haven't fallen three
out of the last four times.

03:23.789 --> 03:26.291
This afternoon, we go airborne.
Yeah.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.210
Yeah!
Yeah!

03:30.128 --> 03:32.756
Yeah! Mmm!
Yeah!

03:35.050 --> 03:36.968
Sitting all by
yourself at the table.

03:37.052 --> 03:39.054
Now, where have I
seen that again?

03:39.137 --> 03:41.848
Oh, right. Every day in
the school cafeteria.

03:41.973 --> 03:43.975
I do that by choice.
School's choice.

03:44.101 --> 03:46.895
Isn't that your nickname? Haley!
Be nice to your sister.

03:46.978 --> 03:48.814
Alex- Good save.

03:49.689 --> 03:51.400
Mom, sign this.
What is it?

03:51.483 --> 03:53.360
They finally bumped me up
to the harder math class.

03:53.443 --> 03:54.903
Third period, Mr. Waters.

03:54.986 --> 03:57.823
What? No, Mom. You cannot sign this.
This is my class.

03:57.906 --> 04:00.075
You're a freshman. What are you
doing in second-year math?

04:00.158 --> 04:02.577
You're a senior. What are you
still doing in second-year math?

04:02.661 --> 04:04.454
Not still. Again.

04:04.538 --> 04:06.164
Alex, be nice to your sister.

04:06.248 --> 04:08.125
Haley, not a good save.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.168
I knew it would suck
having you at my school.

04:10.252 --> 04:11.753
Well, hang in there.
A couple more years,

04:11.837 --> 04:13.296
you'll have it all
to yourself again.

04:13.380 --> 04:14.965
Come on, girls.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.260
Jay, look at this.

04:20.178 --> 04:21.680
It's ruined!
Stella did this.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.265
She chew on my shoe.

04:23.348 --> 04:24.850
You have to discipline
that stupid dog.

04:24.933 --> 04:26.476
I discipline her all the time.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.478
Oh, really? How?
By buying her little cupcakes?

04:28.562 --> 04:31.731
They're not real cupcakes. They're
doggie treats in the form of cupcakes.

04:31.815 --> 04:34.276
Yeah. You should've told that
to Manny before he ate one.

04:34.359 --> 04:37.195
Ah, come on. His coat never looked better.

04:37.279 --> 04:40.407
You wouldn't find this so funny
if she was destroying your shoes.

04:40.490 --> 04:42.659
Well, I don't leave my shoes
laying around, so-

04:42.742 --> 04:45.954
So it's my fault that
she chooses to chew my shoe?

04:46.037 --> 04:48.165
I didn't say that.
You barely said it.

04:48.248 --> 04:51.001
- You have to stop coddling her.
- I don't coddle her.

04:54.921 --> 04:56.423
What?

04:56.506 --> 05:00.719
She tries to drink the water.
it's funny!

05:00.802 --> 05:04.431
You don't look at me in class.
You don't text me.

05:04.514 --> 05:06.725
Who would text
during a class?

05:07.559 --> 05:09.102
What are you?

05:09.186 --> 05:12.689
Honey, I realize that this situation
is not ideal for either one of you,

05:12.772 --> 05:15.400
but sometimes we just
rise above things.

05:15.484 --> 05:16.985
Yes?

05:17.068 --> 05:20.071
Excuse me. Did you notice the
curb here is painted yellow?

05:20.155 --> 05:21.656
Uh, no, I did not.

05:21.740 --> 05:24.075
Wow. It means
"loading and unloading."

05:24.159 --> 05:26.453
Okay. Well, I was just
dropping off my kids.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.580
And yet, I see no kids
emerging from the vehicle.

05:28.705 --> 05:31.416
Well, we were chatting.
Wow.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.921
At the risk of surprising you a third time,
Officer, I've been dropping off here for years-

05:36.046 --> 05:37.506
Move it.
Okay. You betcha.

05:37.589 --> 05:39.591
What was her problem?

05:39.674 --> 05:41.176
You know what you
should have said to her?

05:41.259 --> 05:43.345
Nothing. I should have said nothing.
What would be the point?

05:43.428 --> 05:45.931
I have to see her every day.
I mean, why make it worse?

05:46.014 --> 05:47.599
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

05:47.682 --> 05:50.936
Awkward, unpleasant situation?
Rise above.

05:51.770 --> 05:53.313
Have a nice day.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.690
Yeah.
Love you.

05:55.774 --> 05:57.609
Bye-bye.

06:01.363 --> 06:04.241
"And yet I see no
children emerging from the vehicle."

06:04.324 --> 06:06.910
How would you like to
see my fist emerging into your face?

06:06.993 --> 06:09.079
Oh! Now I think of it!

06:12.123 --> 06:14.042
Day four of the juice fast,

06:14.125 --> 06:17.212
and I'm hungry,
but I'm feelin' pretty good.

06:17.295 --> 06:21.716
Cam, on the other hand,
has gone all Girl, Interrupted

06:21.800 --> 06:25.095
After one, throwing out all of
our food, and two, blaming me,

06:25.178 --> 06:28.765
he entered stage three-
soap actress.

06:28.848 --> 06:31.726
I just wish my sister
would put herself out there more.

06:31.810 --> 06:34.354
She has so much to offer!

06:34.437 --> 06:37.065
Why are men so superficial?

06:38.525 --> 06:41.528
That was followed by stage
four- a rush of epiphanies.

06:41.611 --> 06:44.239
I don't need food.

06:45.699 --> 06:47.742
Look at this.
Architecture's everywhere.

06:47.826 --> 06:50.745
Oh, Spaniards make
amazing athletes.

06:50.829 --> 06:53.164
Into stage five- despair.

06:54.916 --> 06:59.129
Daddy, we hided,
but you didn't seek.

06:59.963 --> 07:00.922
Cam?

07:01.006 --> 07:02.215
Then came rage.

07:03.592 --> 07:05.802
Ow! Ah.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.057
Hey.
Whatcha got there?

07:11.141 --> 07:16.146
The good news is, Cam's never made
it this far into a diet before, so-

07:16.229 --> 07:20.108
Downside? I have no idea what
the next stage is gonna be.

07:20.191 --> 07:22.777
But I'm pretty sure
it's not charming party guest.

07:22.861 --> 07:26.197
Cam, I-l was thinking, I'll take the
bullet tomorrow night at my boss's house.

07:26.281 --> 07:27.907
You don't have to go
to the party.

07:29.326 --> 07:30.952
Th-They're boring.

07:31.036 --> 07:33.121
Some... silly cause.

07:33.204 --> 07:34.748
You know,
lots of people.

07:36.207 --> 07:37.334
Parking.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.420
- Cam, say something.
- Why do you hate me?

07:40.503 --> 07:43.381
- I don't hate you.
- Then why are you trying to push me out of your life?

07:43.465 --> 07:45.550
Because you seem a little...

07:47.344 --> 07:48.511
unhinged.

07:48.595 --> 07:49.929
Okay. You know what I think?

07:50.013 --> 07:51.640
You should worry
a little bit less about me...

07:51.723 --> 07:54.225
and a little bit more about yourself and
what you're gonna wear tomorrow night,

07:54.309 --> 07:55.977
because I saw
what you have laid out,

07:56.061 --> 07:58.772
and I don't think you're gonna
like the way you look in photos.

08:00.315 --> 08:02.275
I hadn't landed on that.

08:03.818 --> 08:05.945
Her hand's in the air,
like, every five seconds,

08:06.029 --> 08:08.823
and she actually reminded
Mr. Waters to assign homework.

08:08.907 --> 08:11.409
The class loved that. Do you
know how embarrassed I was?

08:11.493 --> 08:14.663
Not as embarrassed as I was when
she said eight was a prime number.

08:14.746 --> 08:15.789
Eight, Mom.

08:15.872 --> 08:17.332
Okay, fine.
You know what?

08:17.415 --> 08:19.918
I'm gonna call the school today
and have your schedules changed.

08:20.001 --> 08:23.588
But I want you to know, a little
part of me died today, okay?

08:23.713 --> 08:27.926
I thought the two of you could understand how
being in the same class would benefit you both.

08:28.009 --> 08:30.095
Alex, you-you could've
tutored Haley.

08:30.178 --> 08:33.014
Haley, you could've helped Alex
with her social skills.

08:33.097 --> 08:36.726
Come on. The two of you could've
been two super-Dunphys.

08:36.809 --> 08:38.352
And instead, what are you?

08:38.436 --> 08:41.773
Two bickering half-Dunphys, and
I'm the fool that expected more.

08:41.898 --> 08:43.107
You know what-
How do you ever-

08:43.191 --> 08:47.153
I don't even want to hear it.
Just go upstairs. Go.

08:48.029 --> 08:51.241
Wow. What was that?

08:52.742 --> 08:54.703
That was a master class
in parenting.

08:54.786 --> 08:59.040
Right now, our daughters are upstairs,
making a decision they think is their own,

08:59.124 --> 09:01.876
but really it was an idea that
was skillfully implanted by me.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.129
Inception Claire.

09:04.254 --> 09:06.798
Dangerous game, but I like it.
Mmm.

09:09.884 --> 09:11.136
What are those?

09:11.219 --> 09:13.471
Wire walkers.

09:13.555 --> 09:16.725
You want to go to the dance,
you gotta wear the shoes.

09:16.808 --> 09:18.309
Luke, grab your camera.

09:20.353 --> 09:21.354
Luke!

09:21.438 --> 09:23.064
I wasn't sleeping!

09:24.858 --> 09:28.611
Honey, I-l think
those are jazz shoes.

09:28.695 --> 09:30.196
Nope.
Tightrope shoes.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.741
Got 'em at an estate sale.
Only worn once.

09:32.824 --> 09:34.242
That is not
a ringing endorsement-

09:34.367 --> 09:35.493
Oh!

09:35.577 --> 09:40.707
Phil, honey- Please be...
careful, all right?

09:40.832 --> 09:43.084
Watch the door.

09:45.170 --> 09:46.755
Hey, what'd you get
for number three?

09:46.838 --> 09:49.132
You're not going to learn
if I just give you answers.

09:49.215 --> 09:51.718
Well, what if I gave you
something in return?

09:51.801 --> 09:52.844
Like what?

09:53.678 --> 09:54.929
You can talk to me
in class.

09:58.767 --> 10:00.935
I want lunch at the cool table.

10:01.019 --> 10:03.772
- Then I want all the answers.
- Then I want a week at the table.

10:03.855 --> 10:05.607
- That'll cost you two pop quizzes.
- A month.

10:05.690 --> 10:07.192
- The midterm.
- Deal.

10:08.067 --> 10:10.069
Lookin' great, Dad.

10:10.153 --> 10:14.866
With these steps,
I break the surly bonds-

10:14.949 --> 10:16.576
Chicken in a basket!

10:19.204 --> 10:21.289
Don't look at me.

10:21.414 --> 10:23.416
Mom? Mom!
What? What, what, what?

10:23.500 --> 10:25.293
Mom, did you
call the school yet?

10:25.376 --> 10:27.295
Uh, not yet,
but I was just about to.

10:27.378 --> 10:29.088
Ah, Bartles and Jaymes!

10:29.214 --> 10:31.591
Good. Because we were thinking we
might want to stay in that class.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.718
Really? Oh, girls,
I don't know about that.

10:33.802 --> 10:36.346
- Oh, please let us try it.
- Super-Dunphy.

10:36.429 --> 10:39.265
I can't hold her.
I can't hold her!

10:39.390 --> 10:42.352
Well, maybe one more week.

10:43.228 --> 10:44.854
Thanks, Mom.

10:48.191 --> 10:51.736
I don't know.
A cup of soup, a Cobb salad.

10:51.820 --> 10:53.613
Yeah, it had bacon.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.449
Hey, Cam, I don't have all day
to describe all my meals to you.

10:56.574 --> 11:01.204
Stop eating all
my things, you stupid animal.

11:01.287 --> 11:02.956
No, Cam, not you.
I'll call you back!

11:04.123 --> 11:05.291
Bad doggie!

11:05.375 --> 11:09.128
You want to chew on something?
Okay, okay, okay.

11:09.212 --> 11:13.132
Look at this. Look at
this delicious man shoe.

11:13.216 --> 11:16.886
Eat it. Come on.
Eat it. Eat it!

11:16.970 --> 11:18.805
Mmm. Yummy.

11:18.888 --> 11:21.766
Eat the shoe!

11:21.850 --> 11:23.768
Eat his shoe.
Come on. Eat his shoe.

11:23.852 --> 11:25.979
Yum, yum, Wm, Wm-
Yum, yum, Wm, Wm-

11:26.062 --> 11:28.189
Yeah. Like this, look.

11:28.314 --> 11:29.732
Delicious!

11:29.816 --> 11:32.402
Mom?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.238
Drop it.

11:38.992 --> 11:41.744
- I w-
- Please. I'm sorry you had to see this.

11:48.376 --> 11:50.503
Hello.

11:50.587 --> 11:52.839
Hi, Mrs. Dunphy. This is
Rose from the principal's office.

11:52.922 --> 11:55.800
Could you hold for Principal Weller?
Yes.

11:55.884 --> 11:57.385
No, no, no, no.

11:57.468 --> 11:59.137
Hi, Claire.
Hi, John.

11:59.262 --> 12:00.930
What'd she do this time?

12:01.014 --> 12:03.224
Actually,
I've go! both of them in here.

12:03.308 --> 12:05.351
Both of them?
Really?

12:05.435 --> 12:07.645
Alex was letting Haley
copy her home Work.

12:07.729 --> 12:10.565
Mr. Waters caught them.
I-l don't believe it.

12:10.648 --> 12:14.152
I'm about to have a little talk with them,
so the they'll be out a few minutes late.

12:14.235 --> 12:15.987
Uh, I'm so sorry, John.

12:16.070 --> 12:19.490
And honestly, I-I really am a
better mother than this, I promise.

12:19.574 --> 12:22.118
So you've said.
Mm-hmm.

12:23.828 --> 12:24.829
Seriously?

12:26.831 --> 12:29.375
Seriously? Oh!

12:29.459 --> 12:33.421
Excuse me.
Hey, um, what the hell is this?

12:33.504 --> 12:36.591
This zone is for loading and unloading,
not for talking on the phone.

12:36.674 --> 12:38.509
Yeah, I know, but
I was talking on the phone...

12:38.593 --> 12:40.845
to the school that my kids
are about to come out of, so-

12:40.929 --> 12:43.389
Are you aware this zone
has a time limit?

12:43.473 --> 12:44.807
N-No, I'm not.

12:44.891 --> 12:46.351
Wow.

12:48.186 --> 12:49.979
You know what?
I do want to do some unloading.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.440
I know your type.

12:52.523 --> 12:56.277
Life has been bad to you.
It has made you feel small.

12:56.361 --> 12:59.739
And then one day, somebody
gives you a fake cop outfit,

12:59.822 --> 13:01.950
a toy badge
and a little SpongeBob tie.

13:02.033 --> 13:03.993
Suddenly it's payback time,
right?

13:04.077 --> 13:08.373
Well, I got news for you, Law and
Special Parking Unit.

13:09.374 --> 13:11.209
It's not my fault.

13:16.714 --> 13:21.719
I'm really sorry, Dad. Oh, it's all right.
Everybody throws up at school.

13:21.803 --> 13:25.056
If I had a nickel for every time I puked at
school, you know how much money I'd have?

13:25.139 --> 13:26.641
Thirty-five cents?

13:26.724 --> 13:29.936
Exactly. Now, go get cleaned
up, and I'll call the doctor.

13:30.061 --> 13:33.106
Wait, Dad. I don't need a doctor.
What's up?

13:33.189 --> 13:36.484
The other day, Uncle Mitchell
brought over a bag of junk food...

13:36.567 --> 13:38.486
so he and Cam could do
a Jew fast.

13:38.569 --> 13:39.821
Juice fast?

13:39.904 --> 13:41.489
I'm pretty sure
he said Jew.

13:41.572 --> 13:45.201
But anyway, I took the bag,
and I hid it, and I ate it all.

13:45.326 --> 13:47.912
Oh, buddy.
I couldn't help myself.

13:47.996 --> 13:50.331
I'm weak.
Don't look at me.

13:50.415 --> 13:52.834
It's all right.
it's okay.

13:52.917 --> 13:57.588
Hey, you learned a lesson. A painful lesson.

13:59.215 --> 14:03.052
I guess we both have.
What do you mean?

14:03.136 --> 14:06.472
I always saw myself as a guy who could
soar through the sky, dancing on a wire.

14:06.556 --> 14:09.767
I can't even get across one
six inches off the ground.

14:09.851 --> 14:12.687
Well,
maybe that's the problem.

14:12.770 --> 14:17.191
Maybe you keep falling because part
of you knows that you can fall.

14:17.275 --> 14:20.611
Maybe if the wire was much,
much higher, you wouldn't fall.

14:21.612 --> 14:24.365
Oh, Luke, Luke, Luke.

14:25.491 --> 14:27.994
You are a genius.
Come on. We got work to do!

14:28.119 --> 14:31.497
Yes! Can I have a doughnut first?
Yes, you can!

14:31.581 --> 14:34.500
Ah, there they are.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.919
My Super-Dunphys.
We're sorry, but we just-

14:37.003 --> 14:39.964
Ah, ah, ah.
You don't get to talk!

14:40.048 --> 14:42.925
You had a chance
to be better people today.

14:43.009 --> 14:46.763
You, to be more well-rounded,
and you, to be a better student.

14:46.846 --> 14:50.892
You could have elevated the Dunphy name,
but instead you chose to tarnish it.

14:50.975 --> 14:52.935
So congratulations, ladies.

14:53.019 --> 14:54.645
You brought this family
to a new low.

14:56.939 --> 14:57.899
Mom, are you-

14:57.982 --> 14:59.567
Yeah.
Yeah, I am.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.028
And I would actually like to get
these loosened up, if I might.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.780
Are we gonna have
any more trouble?

15:03.863 --> 15:04.906
No, ma'am.

15:04.989 --> 15:06.699
Claire, do you
need me to drive the girls?

15:06.783 --> 15:08.785
All good, Janet.
Real good.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.413
Goat cheese
risotto ball?

15:12.497 --> 15:13.956
No, thank you.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.167
Are you sure?
They're so good.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.752
Walk away.

15:17.835 --> 15:20.088
It's tough enough to deal with
Cam when I'm at full strength.

15:20.171 --> 15:22.507
But I have been fasting
just as long as he has,

15:22.590 --> 15:24.092
and I do not have
the energy...

15:24.175 --> 15:26.219
to deal with
a big, needy brisket case-

15:26.302 --> 15:29.097
Bras- Basket case.

15:29.180 --> 15:33.601
Cam! Don't be mad at me, but I think
that you really need to eat something.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.562
What? You're supposed to
be my support.

15:36.646 --> 15:37.939
Oh, away from me, temptress.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.399
And I never thought I would
call you that in a negative way.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.152
I've seen her do
a lot of crazy stuff,

15:43.236 --> 15:45.363
but this
is a whole new level.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.324
- Is this a people cookie?
- You're good.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.243
A definitive yes or no
would be appreciated.

15:50.326 --> 15:51.828
Those cupcakes
did a number on me.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.333
Are you happy?

15:57.416 --> 15:59.794
You have reduced me
to a person who eats a shoe.

15:59.877 --> 16:00.878
Gloria, sit.

16:00.962 --> 16:02.296
Do you think this is funny,

16:02.380 --> 16:03.923
to talk to me like I am a dog?

16:04.006 --> 16:05.508
I'm not talking to you
like you're a dog.

16:05.591 --> 16:08.177
I'm just asking you to sit, so we
can get to the bottom of this.

16:08.261 --> 16:10.138
Okay, fine.

16:10.221 --> 16:11.514
Good girl.

16:12.223 --> 16:13.307
Come on. You set me up.

16:13.391 --> 16:15.017
Gloria, why are you
acting so crazy?

16:15.101 --> 16:16.602
It's just a little dog.

16:16.686 --> 16:18.479
It's not the little dog
that is making me crazy.

16:18.563 --> 16:19.856
It's you that
is making me crazy!

16:19.981 --> 16:21.482
Me?
Yeah.

16:21.566 --> 16:24.235
You used to put me first! You
used to want me in that shower!

16:24.318 --> 16:25.736
Should I be here for this?

16:25.820 --> 16:27.405
No, Manny, it's okay.
I go.

16:27.488 --> 16:30.783
But I want you to know this. Where
I come from, man cherish woman.

16:30.867 --> 16:34.745
It goes wife, mistress, dog.
Dog always at the bottom!

16:37.248 --> 16:39.333
As you can imagine,
I get asked to help, uh,

16:39.417 --> 16:41.210
with a lot of these
environmental causes.

16:41.294 --> 16:45.715
Usually, I buy a ticket, bid on
Shaquille O'Neal's big shoe-

16:45.840 --> 16:49.010
and, uh, come home.

16:49.093 --> 16:52.346
But then, something happened.

16:52.430 --> 16:55.266
Um, I love paddle surfing.

16:55.349 --> 16:59.103
And each time I'd go out,
I'd see this one sea lion.

16:59.187 --> 17:00.771
He'd pop his head up,
he'd check me out.

17:00.855 --> 17:04.150
I got so used to seein' him,
I even named him- Snorkels.

17:04.275 --> 17:06.861
God, I do not like where this is going.

17:06.944 --> 17:10.239
So one day, I, uh, I go
out, and I see Snorkels.

17:10.323 --> 17:13.201
But he's doin' this weird
twisting thing in the water.

17:13.284 --> 17:16.204
- Oh, God. Oh, God, oh, God.
- Shh. Shh.

17:16.287 --> 17:20.583
So I paddle over, and I see he's
got a plastic grocery bag...

17:20.665 --> 17:23.627
wrapped around his neck
and one of his fins.

17:23.711 --> 17:27.298
And I freaked. Tried to get
it off with my paddle.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.675
Didn't work,
so I jumped in,

17:31.302 --> 17:34.096
but he disappeared
under the water, and, uh-

17:34.180 --> 17:36.515
Don't say it.
Don't you dare say it.

17:36.599 --> 17:38.643
And I never saw him again.

17:38.726 --> 17:42.230
Oh. This is the saddest
thing I've ever-

17:44.690 --> 17:47.735
Mitchell, are you okay?

17:47.818 --> 17:51.239
No, of course I'm not okay.
None of this is okay.

17:51.322 --> 17:53.658
Okay. You need to pull yourself together,
'cause we're at your boss's house.

17:53.741 --> 17:56.410
He drowned, Cam!

17:56.494 --> 17:58.037
Okay.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.082
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I think he just needs a little air.

18:01.165 --> 18:04.669
You know who else needed air?
Snorkels!

18:05.670 --> 18:07.171
Excuse me.

18:07.255 --> 18:11.259
Snorkels!
Where are you, Snorkels?

18:11.342 --> 18:12.885
Mitchell, get back here!

18:12.969 --> 18:14.679
Oh, Snorkels.

18:14.762 --> 18:16.305
Mitchell,
what is wrong with you?

18:16.389 --> 18:18.766
What do you think is wrong with me?
I'm starving!

18:18.849 --> 18:21.769
Well, if you're starving,
then just eat something!

18:21.852 --> 18:24.981
I can't eat something, because
then you'll get mad at me,

18:25.064 --> 18:26.732
and we're at
my boss's house.

18:26.816 --> 18:28.651
I'm not gonna get mad at you!

18:28.734 --> 18:32.571
I appreciate what you're doing for me.
I'm doing it for you.

18:32.655 --> 18:35.449
Oh, you don't have to do anything for me.
I love you just the way you are.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.618
I love you
just the way you are.

18:40.705 --> 18:42.290
Whoa!

18:42.415 --> 18:44.208
Okay.  I got you!
I got you!

18:44.333 --> 18:46.043
Thank you.
I got you! I got you!

18:47.378 --> 18:49.380
I got you! I can walk.
I can walk.

18:50.464 --> 18:53.718
I think Mitchell may just be
a work friend.

18:58.347 --> 19:00.558
I letdown
my mom and dad today-

19:01.559 --> 19:03.311
Worse than that,

19:03.394 --> 19:05.146
I let down my teacher.

19:05.229 --> 19:08.524
It's all my fault. Everything
I touch turns to detention.

19:08.607 --> 19:11.319
I'm sorry, Mom.
Me too.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.698
I don't really have a whole lot
of moral high ground to stand on.

19:15.781 --> 19:19.118
I wasn't exactly my
best self today either.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.204
All in all, not a great
day for the Dunphys.

19:23.331 --> 19:25.624
Come on, Dad!
Believe in yourself!

19:25.750 --> 19:29.170
You're making the impossible unimpossible.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.339
Phil. Oh, my God.

19:31.422 --> 19:34.884
Don't even bother. He's in the zone.
He can't hear you.

19:35.009 --> 19:37.345
Go, Dad!
You got this!

19:39.638 --> 19:42.016
All Week long, I've been
telling my girls how to act...

19:42.099 --> 19:43.601
instead of showing them.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.811
But not Phil.

19:45.895 --> 19:50.024
Phil could have said, "Alex, relax.
Don't take everything so seriously." ...

19:50.107 --> 19:53.611
Or "Haley, challenge yourself
Don't give up so easily."

19:53.694 --> 19:57.323
But instead of talking the talk,
Phil Walked the Walk.

19:58.824 --> 20:01.035
And isn't that what we're supposed
to do for the people We love ?

20:06.624 --> 20:08.793
It's definitely a challenge.

20:08.876 --> 20:12.713
Right, two, three.
And left, two-

20:12.797 --> 20:16.717
But Phil made it look easy
seven feet off the ground.

20:16.801 --> 20:17.885
Oh!

20:19.929 --> 20:22.139
- You're awesome!
- Oh, my goodness.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.935
Turns out I've had
my Super Dunphy all along.

20:26.018 --> 20:27.561
Yeah!

20:27.645 --> 20:30.022
Ohh!

20:30.106 --> 20:33.734
What was on my mind as I was
walking across that wire?

20:33.818 --> 20:36.737
I kept thinking,
"If I can do this,

20:38.656 --> 20:41.117
then I've got two ways
of getting across my yard."

20:44.161 --> 20:46.038
Did you have fun?
Yes.

20:46.122 --> 20:48.707
She's the cutest doggie
in the whole world.

20:48.791 --> 20:50.251
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

20:50.334 --> 20:51.836
Let's go find
your daddies.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.421
We're in here.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.924
Oh, my God. These
cupcakes are so good.

I'm so sorry we helped ourselves.
We were so hungry.

20:59.260 --> 21:00.344
They are delicious.

21:00.428 --> 21:02.430
I love that they're not
too sweet, you know?

21:02.513 --> 21:06.392
Mmm. They taste almost
like pété. I mean-

21:06.475 --> 21:08.144
But why are you eating?

21:08.269 --> 21:09.728
Well- Been on a juice cleanse.

21:09.854 --> 21:12.356
You need to mind your own
business, sweetie, for now. Yeah.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.859
Mmm.
