And my daughters are gone.

12:12.669 --> 12:13.638
And Gus is gone!

12:13.645 --> 12:15.815
A normal person would know that!

12:16.877 --> 12:18.669
A... a... and they would know

12:18.702 --> 12:20.819
not to call me, not to knock on my door,

12:20.859 --> 12:22.418
not to come to my house!

- we were partners.
- Marco: No, no, no, no, no...

12:44.679 --> 12:46.723
You and I...

12:46.843 --> 12:50.300
are just two people who
worked together on a case.

<i>Fausto: You're too skinny.</i>

14:50.851 --> 14:52.903
You need una steak.

We go to dinner one night.

14:57.662 --> 14:59.653
Charlotte: Does that mean we have a deal?

15:13.313 --> 15:15.391
<i>Fausto: Five kilos per week.</i>

15:16.015 --> 15:18.823
We meet, I pay you.

15:20.117 --> 15:21.557
Entonces?

15:21.610 --> 15:23.442
We get to know each other.

15:24.822 --> 15:26.607
Charlotte: I can do that.

15:28.671 --> 15:30.696
Fausto: I'm a nice guy, you know.

15:31.784 --> 15:33.224
Charlotte: Okay.

15:42.383 --> 15:44.288
Fausto: Last man I killed,

15:45.456 --> 15:48.104
was nice enough to cut his dick,

15:48.502 --> 15:51.694
balls, and lips off.

15:52.072 --> 15:54.216
And send to his wife.

15:55.935 --> 15:58.238
Didn't want her to get lonely.

Linder: Well...

16:44.976 --> 16:46.768
my bride is missing.

16:50.863 --> 16:53.524
She was working at a factory in JuÃ¡rez.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.215
Last seen three days ago.

16:58.257 --> 17:00.294
Sonya: Have you talked to her family?

17:03.095 --> 17:04.541
Linder: No family.

17:04.582 --> 17:06.082
Sonya: Hmm, friends?

17:07.097 --> 17:10.602
Linder: She's what you
call uh, alone in life.

17:11.392 --> 17:12.759
Sonya: Except for you.

17:16.404 --> 17:17.957
Linder: I misspoke...

17:18.077 --> 17:20.247
when I called her my bride.

17:20.432 --> 17:23.054
She's, uh, more like my intended.

17:23.246 --> 17:24.228
Sonya: Steven,

17:24.268 --> 17:26.829
you were a person of
interest in the bridge case.

17:26.883 --> 17:28.848
- Linder: I am aware.
- Sonya: I found...

17:29.094 --> 17:31.565
burned women's clothes up at your trailer.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.315
How do I know you didn't take this girl?

17:38.056 --> 17:39.920
Linder: That's not who I am.

17:40.557 --> 17:41.872
Sonya: Who are you?

17:43.644 --> 17:45.575
Linder: I help people.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.653
Sonya: I remember you saying that.

17:47.692 --> 17:48.861
Linder: Women...

17:48.907 --> 17:51.098
who are being abused by a violent husband,

17:51.111 --> 17:52.578
partner, or what have you.

17:53.341 --> 17:55.259
Sonya: How do they find you?

17:57.681 --> 18:00.316
Linder: I've become kin of
known for this sort of work.

18:00.794 --> 18:01.956
And you bring them here?

18:02.015 --> 18:04.033
Linder: I have medical supplies,

18:05.420 --> 18:08.022
nutritious food, water...

18:09.695 --> 18:11.241
safe place to rest.

18:13.511 --> 18:15.548
You, you can look inside.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.449
Sonya: Stand back, please.

18:29.268 --> 18:31.717
(Wind blowing outside)

19:06.250 --> 19:09.098
Linder: I burn their things
so they can't be tracked.

19:11.368 --> 19:13.286
Sonya: Where do they go next?

19:14.108 --> 19:15.847
Linder: A safe house.

19:19.338 --> 19:20.785
Sonya: Why do you do it?

19:20.905 --> 19:22.325
Linder: 'Cause I can.

19:24.893 --> 19:27.056
Sonya: That's pretty unusual, Steven.

19:27.335 --> 19:29.652
- Linder: Yeah, but not illegal.
- Sonya: No,

19:29.890 --> 19:30.859
no.

19:34.635 --> 19:37.150
Why did you call Eva you
bride when she wasn't?

19:38.942 --> 19:41.279
Linder: Because I am bound to her.

19:43.296 --> 19:44.869
Sonya: Does she feel the same way?

19:45.208 --> 19:46.854
Linder: You have to ask her.

19:47.943 --> 19:50.929
Sonya: Is there any chance she
just went back to her boyfriend?

19:51.155 --> 19:53.325
Linder: No, not really, nope.

19:56.130 --> 19:58.024
I'll keep looking for her.

19:58.695 --> 20:01.044
Tirelessly, until I find her.

20:01.661 --> 20:02.863
But I think...

20:03.970 --> 20:06.340
law enforcement would be helpful.

20:10.647 --> 20:12.798
Sonya: I'm not a JuÃ¡rez cop.

20:13.601 --> 20:16.395
Linder: Well, the car that
picked her up had Texas plates.

20:19.058 --> 20:20.962
Will you help me find her?

20:26.883 --> 20:28.780
Adriana: Doesn't the sun feel nice?

20:28.979 --> 20:31.368
Frye: Yeah, if you're into skin cancer.

20:31.587 --> 20:33.492
Adriana: Fresh air. It's not overrated.

20:33.505 --> 20:36.240
Frye (Groans): I feel
like I'm 80 years old.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.071
Adriana: 'Cause you're
living like an invalid.

20:38.596 --> 20:40.753
Frye: Uh, hello I am an invalid.

20:41.192 --> 20:44.212
- Adriana: You're ready to wheel yourself.
- Frye: What?

20:44.332 --> 20:46.209
Adriana: You need to learn how to use this.

20:46.222 --> 20:47.523
Frye: It's only temporary.

20:47.643 --> 20:48.539
Adriana: Well, who's gonna push you

20:48.565 --> 20:50.284
around in the meantime? Not me.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.269
Frye: I feel shitty.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.120
Adriana: It's depressing here.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.408
You got to come back to work.

20:58.866 --> 20:59.888
Frye: You know what I was thinking

20:59.915 --> 21:01.674
when I was sailing over that bridge?

21:02.882 --> 21:05.577
- Adriana: Check me out, I'm superman.
- (Frye laughs)

21:06.674 --> 21:08.915
Frye: Don't let me die. I want to live.

21:10.149 --> 21:11.344
Adriana: And you did.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.215
Frye: Yeah, but for what?

21:14.370 --> 21:16.899
Life is short, and I've
already wasted so much of mine.

21:16.932 --> 21:18.280
I don't recommend it by the way.

21:18.705 --> 21:20.178
Adriana: Okay, Yoda.

21:21.081 --> 21:22.322
Frye: Yeah.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.137
(Frye sighs)

21:32.942 --> 21:34.276
Adriana: I saw you fall Daniel.

21:34.322 --> 21:35.795
It was scary as shit.

21:36.127 --> 21:38.556
Frye: It was pretty scary
from my point of view, too.

21:39.784 --> 21:41.370
Adriana: I'm really glad you're alive.

21:41.589 --> 21:42.916
Frye: You love me.

21:43.746 --> 21:45.843
You just want to have my babies.

21:47.655 --> 21:49.381
Adriana: See you back there.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.896
Frye: Wait, wait, wait, wait. I was...

21:51.949 --> 21:53.303
I was kidding.

21:53.323 --> 21:54.976
Hey, don't just walk away.

21:55.852 --> 21:58.441
I... hey, I only got one arm.

21:58.845 --> 22:00.942
Wade: She disappeared in JuÃ¡rez.

22:01.274 --> 22:04.693
- Sonya: The car had American plates.
- Wade: Still.

22:05.602 --> 22:07.022
Sonya: She worked in factory,

22:07.042 --> 22:09.651
and a lot of those
managers live in El Paso.

22:09.710 --> 22:12.664
Wade: Well, we're gonna
need somebody in JuÃ¡rez.

22:13.580 --> 22:15.212
Sonya: I know.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.177
Wade: He told you to leave him be.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.234
Sonya: He'd care about this.

22:22.626 --> 22:24.810
And he really needs to get back to work.

22:25.049 --> 22:26.748
Wade: Well, then...

22:26.987 --> 22:28.600
Well, good luck.

22:30.571 --> 22:32.980
How you getting on with the motor pool car?

22:33.505 --> 22:35.642
Sonya: It doesn't have a tape deck.

22:52.971 --> 22:54.080
Thank you.

22:54.086 --> 22:55.062
Wade: Carmen keeps asking

22:55.089 --> 22:57.106
when you're gonna come on up to the house.

22:57.949 --> 22:58.985
Sonya: Soon.

22:59.296 --> 23:00.668
Wade: We're gonna hold you to that.

23:02.629 --> 23:05.317
- Nighty night.
- Sonya: Night.

23:16.215 --> 23:18.133
(Indistinct chatter)

24:35.714 --> 24:37.506
Sonya: Marco.

24:39.523 --> 24:40.698
I need your help.

24:42.238 --> 24:43.811
(Marco sighs)

24:49.127 --> 24:51.609
Sonya: There's this girl, Eva Guerra...

24:55.220 --> 24:57.316
Sonya: She's been missing for three days.

25:00.502 --> 25:03.003
Marco: A missing girl in JuÃ¡rez!

25:04.729 --> 25:06.641
Oh, my God!

25:07.271 --> 25:08.629
"Look, Marco...

25:10.397 --> 25:12.016
I have this little...

25:12.043 --> 25:14.432
Glass here. Let's empty the ocean with it."

25:14.552 --> 25:16.523
Sonya: I know you care about those girls.

25:16.576 --> 25:18.016
I know you do.

25:18.879 --> 25:21.633
Marco: Just gonna go to the
only place you cannot follow me.

25:23.585 --> 25:25.310
(Crashes)

25:29.452 --> 25:30.574
Sonya: All right.

25:32.227 --> 25:33.773
Taking you home.

25:35.791 --> 25:36.800
Come on, get up.

25:37.012 --> 25:38.025
Get up.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.958
<i>- (Marco slurring words)
- Gracias.</i>

25:43.078 --> 25:45.016
<i>Okay now...</i>

25:47.551 --> 25:50.359
- Marco: You don't have children.
- Sonya: No.

25:50.565 --> 25:53.445
Marco: So you don't
understand, then, that...

25:53.658 --> 25:55.582
<i>of course you don't. (Laughing)</i>

25:56.345 --> 25:59.717
<i>- You don't understand a lot of things.
- Sonya: Shh...</i>

26:00.201 --> 26:02.644
<i>- (Marco laughing loudly)
- Shh, Marco, quiet.</i>

26:03.978 --> 26:05.750
<i>(Coughing)</i>

26:06.215 --> 26:08.637
Marco: If... if... if
you had to shoot me...

26:08.830 --> 26:11.080
<i>- Sonya: Keep your voice down.
- Marco: You should have killed me!</i>

26:11.113 --> 26:12.175
<i>Sonya: What?</i>

26:12.918 --> 26:15.467
Marco: He was my kid! He goes, I go!

26:15.507 --> 26:17.338
<i>Sonya: Shh. People are sleeping.</i>

26:17.345 --> 26:18.765
Marco: Why are they sleeping?

26:18.799 --> 26:20.292
<i>Sonya: Because it's 3:00 in the morning.</i>

26:21.978 --> 26:24.215
Marco: And my son is gone.

26:25.190 --> 26:27.049
<i>Forever gone.</i>

26:28.456 --> 26:30.255
How can you sleep?

26:34.184 --> 26:35.982
<i>(Door creaks)</i>

26:38.969 --> 26:40.435
<i>Sonya: Keys.</i>

26:41.119 --> 26:43.369
Marco: Keys...

26:58.495 --> 26:59.397
<i>Sonya: Okay.</i>

26:59.696 --> 27:00.977
- Marco: I got it.
- Sonya: Mm-hmm.

27:01.003 --> 27:02.596
<i>Marco: I got it.</i>

27:10.607 --> 27:11.616
<i>- Thank you.
- Sonya: All right.</i>

27:11.656 --> 27:12.698
Marco: You gotta go.

27:12.731 --> 27:14.172
<i>- I said go!
- Sonya: No!</i>

27:14.371 --> 27:15.519
I said no.

27:15.546 --> 27:16.886
<i>- Marco: Oh...
- Sonya: I am staying.</i>

27:16.900 --> 27:18.423
Marco: Who do you think you are?

27:18.778 --> 27:22.057
<i>Sonya: I don't find
people very often, Marco.</i>

27:27.347 --> 27:29.039
Sonya: You don't think that.

27:29.159 --> 27:31.594
<i>- Marco: I don't care.
- Sonya: But...</i>

27:31.714 --> 27:33.134
You care, Marco.

27:35.589 --> 27:37.375
<i>I know you care.</i>

27:43.162 --> 27:44.708
<i>That's what I mean.</i>

27:46.168 --> 27:48.949
So don't tell me, you're not my partner.

27:48.969 --> 27:49.924
<i>Okay.</i>

27:50.044 --> 27:52.009
And don't send me away.

27:57.677 --> 27:58.937
<i>'Cause I don't...</i>

27:59.581 --> 28:01.546
I don't have another one.

28:14.355 --> 28:15.205
<i>(Crash)</i>

28:15.211 --> 28:18.291
Oh! All right.

28:20.268 --> 28:21.954
<i>Marco: In here.</i>

28:26.308 --> 28:28.339
<i>Sonya: All right.</i>

28:32.919 --> 28:34.804
<i>(Marco moans softly)</i>

28:52.937 --> 28:55.326
<i>Marco: I still can smell him.</i>

28:55.571 --> 28:57.045
Sonya: Drink this.

29:05.533 --> 29:07.411
<i>(Marco exhales)</i>

29:08.513 --> 29:10.146
(Belches)

29:11.938 --> 29:13.139
Sorry.

29:18.494 --> 29:20.611
<i>Gus had a crush on you.</i>

29:22.231 --> 29:23.777
Sonya: Yeah.

29:24.156 --> 29:25.768
Marco: You knew that?

29:26.240 --> 29:28.689
<i>- Sonya: He bought me chocolates.
- (Marco chuckles)</i>

29:28.902 --> 29:30.534
<i>Marco: I didn't know that.</i>

29:30.567 --> 29:32.313
Sonya: I told him you wouldn't like that.

29:32.625 --> 29:34.145
<i>- Marco: Oh, no.
- Sonya: If we dated.</i>

29:34.265 --> 29:36.382
Marco: Nope, I would not.

29:43.384 --> 29:44.917
<i>Sonya: He was a sweet boy.</i>

29:49.351 --> 29:50.970
<i>Marco: He was a sweet boy.</i>

30:02.261 --> 30:05.334
Sonya (Grunting): Okay. Here we go

30:05.566 --> 30:06.874
<i>(Grunts)</i>

30:09.317 --> 30:12.755
Marco (Slurring): Can't
stop thinking about him.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.188
<i>Sonya: I know.</i>

30:17.766 --> 30:19.385
Marco: David, I mean.

30:23.527 --> 30:26.221
Why does he get to live?

30:28.996 --> 30:31.577
<i>(Grumbles)</i>

30:50.089 --> 30:51.675
Sonya: Good morning.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.429
Marco: You stayed.

30:57.190 --> 30:59.054
Sonya: You don't remember?

31:01.975 --> 31:04.186
My mom always liked eggs in the morning,

31:04.206 --> 31:05.566
after a rough night.

31:06.714 --> 31:08.168
(Marco sighs)

31:09.303 --> 31:10.405
Marco: Thank you.

31:20.898 --> 31:22.744
Mmm...

31:24.808 --> 31:26.573
Sonya: Did you make your bed?

31:28.094 --> 31:30.171
Marco: What are you, my mother?

31:33.005 --> 31:35.275
Sonya: When my sister died...

31:37.279 --> 31:39.961
I stayed with Hank and
his wife for a while.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.159
Marco: Mm-hmm.

31:41.740 --> 31:43.678
Sonya: Carmen had one rule for me,

31:44.912 --> 31:48.038
"always get up and make your bed."

31:48.675 --> 31:50.460
No matter how bad I felt,

31:51.868 --> 31:53.667
I had to face the day.

31:56.554 --> 31:57.841
Marco: Hmm.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.176
I think I'll go into the station today.

32:08.561 --> 32:10.805
- Say hello.
- Sonya: Can I come?

32:12.259 --> 32:14.323
Marco: You want to run the girl's name.

32:14.388 --> 32:15.495
Sonya: Yes, please.

32:16.041 --> 32:17.176
Marco: Okay.

32:18.285 --> 32:20.541
See, I remember some things.

32:25.207 --> 32:26.999
(Speaking Spanish)

32:28.937 --> 32:30.205
Eva Guerra?

34:02.304 --> 34:04.089
Celia: Marco.

34:09.002 --> 34:09.889
(Marco speaking Spanish)

34:18.851 --> 34:20.397
Robles: And what brings you here?

34:20.516 --> 34:22.687
I thought our work was done.

34:23.583 --> 34:26.464
Sonya: Looking for a missing
girl last seen in JuÃ¡rez.

34:26.676 --> 34:29.178
Marco: Uh, I said we could run her name.

34:30.114 --> 34:31.382
Robles: Of course.

34:36.056 --> 34:37.197
Sonya: Her name...

34:37.728 --> 34:39.567
is Eva Guerra.

34:39.839 --> 34:41.040
23 years old.

35:03.359 --> 35:04.906
Robles: Anything?

35:06.319 --> 35:07.726
Celia: No record of her.

35:07.846 --> 35:09.717
Sonya: No one matches her description?

35:11.256 --> 35:12.703
Robles: So sorry.

35:13.506 --> 35:15.550
Now, if you'll excuse us...

35:30.113 --> 35:32.310
Frye: I... honestly I
cannot eat another bite.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.175
So much better than hospital food.

35:34.195 --> 35:36.299
- Sofia: No beer for you?
- Frye: Um...

35:37.255 --> 35:39.910
No. A back rub would be great, though.

35:40.030 --> 35:42.366
Elena: So does everything
still work down there?

35:42.392 --> 35:43.693
- Adriana: Elena.
- Elena: What?

35:43.733 --> 35:44.603
It's just a question.

35:44.636 --> 35:47.829
Frye: My mighty twig and my
berries are fine, thank you.

35:47.875 --> 35:48.851
(Sofia speaks Spanish)

35:58.096 --> 36:00.160
Frye: Hey, what's she saying?
She's talking about me, huh?

36:00.506 --> 36:02.377
Daniela: She doesn't think
Adriana should marry you.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.189
Frye: Yeah, you can say that again.

36:08.602 --> 36:09.704
Frye: Oh, ay, chicas.

36:21.942 --> 36:24.610
Frye: Nice, calm evening at home, huh.

36:24.663 --> 36:25.693
Adriana: This is the crazy house.

36:25.719 --> 36:28.022
I'm so sick of it.

36:37.878 --> 36:40.473
Frye: Hey, you know, maybe we
could go, like, get some ice cream

36:40.493 --> 36:42.146
- or something?
- Adriana: We can't.

36:42.212 --> 36:43.427
Because I date women,

36:43.460 --> 36:45.511
- I'm an embarrassment to the family.
- Daniela: Â¿QuÃ©?

36:55.573 --> 36:57.863
Frye: Oh, shit.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.987
Wade: There's something about
the chorizo on your side.

39:04.414 --> 39:07.049
Marco: You start your
mornings in JuÃ¡rez often?

39:08.510 --> 39:10.156
Wade: I figured...

39:10.467 --> 39:13.049
I had the best chance of you
showing up if I came here.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.398
Marco: So?

39:16.122 --> 39:18.313
Wade: So I wanted to talk, that's all.

39:19.879 --> 39:23.044
Occurred to me you might
not be at court today.

39:23.635 --> 39:25.374
Marco: I haven't decided yet.

39:27.604 --> 39:29.947
Wade: Well, you're up,
you're dressed, you're shaved.

39:31.128 --> 39:32.867
That's a good sign.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.999
You able to find any peace?

39:40.141 --> 39:42.218
Marco: Ten seconds a day.

39:42.935 --> 39:44.296
Wade: Is that right?

39:45.557 --> 39:47.920
Marco: When I open my
eyes in the morning...

39:49.188 --> 39:51.259
for ten seconds,

39:52.082 --> 39:54.378
I don't remember he's gone.

39:56.083 --> 39:58.167
That this is my life now.

40:02.561 --> 40:05.646
Wade: Can you let the system
take care of David Tate,

40:05.653 --> 40:07.452
so you can take care of yourself?

40:11.613 --> 40:12.946
Marco: I don't know.

40:17.691 --> 40:20.970
Wade: Well, he's gonna go to prison
with or without your testimony.

40:24.647 --> 40:27.753
- Marco: Then it doesn't matter, does it?
- Wade: But if you say it...

40:29.857 --> 40:32.180
and I'm gonna say it, Sonya's gonna say it,

40:32.207 --> 40:33.462
but if you say it...

40:35.858 --> 40:38.307
you just maybe might leave
it there a little bit.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.143
Marco: Maybe.

40:46.597 --> 40:48.435
Maybe not.

40:49.451 --> 40:51.958
Wade: Well, it's all a
guessing game, isn't it?

40:53.940 --> 40:55.081
But...

40:55.745 --> 40:57.222
just saying that you might get

40:57.242 --> 40:59.054
yourself another second in the morning.

42:12.217 --> 42:14.029
Gracias.

42:25.153 --> 42:26.965
(Wade sighs)

42:32.394 --> 42:34.001
Sonya: You came.

42:36.166 --> 42:38.075
Marco: Yeah, I came.

42:38.812 --> 42:40.239
Wade: Good for you.

42:41.638 --> 42:43.000
