WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:06.304
This seems like a nice spot.

00:06.347 --> 00:08.913
Okay. If you like it,
I love it.

00:11.913 --> 00:13.608
Wait.

00:13.652 --> 00:15.043
Actually, I don't like it.

00:15.086 --> 00:16.130
Okay. Let's see.

00:16.173 --> 00:18.347
Over by the pond
was too sunny.

00:18.391 --> 00:20.434
The gazebo wasn't
sunny enough.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.521
And here?

00:21.565 --> 00:22.652
I don't know.

00:22.695 --> 00:23.869
Just, like, bad energy.

00:23.913 --> 00:25.391
Seriously?
I know.

00:25.434 --> 00:27.391
It just, it doesn't feel right
for some reason.

00:28.956 --> 00:30.782
How about under this tree?

00:30.826 --> 00:33.652
I kind of like the energy
right here.

00:33.695 --> 00:35.043
It's the last move,
I promise.

00:37.086 --> 00:39.173
It feels much better under here.

00:39.217 --> 00:40.608
Okay.

00:45.608 --> 00:47.478
Thank you.

00:48.913 --> 00:50.652
[gasping]

00:50.695 --> 00:52.478
WOMAN:
Oh, my God...

00:53.565 --> 00:57.000
If you'd have stayed
in that spot...

01:35.695 --> 01:37.260
Excuse me, my friends.

01:37.304 --> 01:39.565
If I may have
your attention, please.

01:39.608 --> 01:41.826
Looks like you're about
to burst into song, Jimmy.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.347
Oh, it's much better than that.

01:43.391 --> 01:45.130
Why the coat on
such a lovely day?

01:45.173 --> 01:47.521
TONY: Holy full-frontal,
autopsy gremlin.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.130
Are you about to flash us
your Magic Johnson?

01:50.173 --> 01:51.347
Even better.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.086
Wow.

01:55.130 --> 01:57.260
Huh? What do you think?

01:57.782 --> 01:58.782
[laughs]

01:58.826 --> 01:59.869
Well?

01:59.913 --> 02:01.521
Eh...Awesome.

02:01.565 --> 02:03.043
Right? So bad it's good.

02:03.086 --> 02:04.869
I wouldn't go that far.

02:04.913 --> 02:06.652
JIMMY: The wedding is
in south Florida,

02:06.695 --> 02:09.652
so Breena and I originally
were thinking tropical pastels.

02:09.695 --> 02:13.391
But then we saw this baby,
and we thought, let's go kitsch.

02:13.434 --> 02:14.782
ZIVA:
"Kitsch."

02:14.826 --> 02:16.217
That is a German word.Yeah.

02:16.260 --> 02:17.608
Kitsch, camp,

02:17.652 --> 02:18.782
completely tacky.

02:18.826 --> 02:20.565
Don't forget completely cool.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.000
Eye of the beholder,
McCumberbund.

02:22.043 --> 02:24.782
Now if I could just
get your sizes.

02:24.826 --> 02:26.043
And Breena will be
calling you, Ziva,

02:26.086 --> 02:27.565
about the bridesmaids' dresses.

02:27.608 --> 02:29.956
I'm telling you, if you think
these tuxes are cool...

02:30.000 --> 02:31.739
I cannot wait to see
what she has chosen, Jimmy,

02:31.782 --> 02:33.782
but, really, I do not need
to be in the wedding.

02:33.826 --> 02:35.391
Oh, we insist!

02:35.434 --> 02:36.608
TONY:
Excuse me.

02:36.652 --> 02:38.217
Which one
do I check here, Jimmy--

02:38.260 --> 02:41.260
usher, groomsman
or best man?

02:42.217 --> 02:44.695
Uh, we're just having everybody

02:44.739 --> 02:47.478
check, uh, "groomsman" for now,
till I've decided.

02:47.521 --> 02:49.130
You haven't picked
a best man yet?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.565
I've narrowed down the list.

02:52.608 --> 02:54.043
Narrowed it down to...?[cell phone chirps]

02:54.086 --> 02:55.434
Gibbs.

02:55.478 --> 02:56.521
Oh, God, I wish.

02:56.565 --> 02:58.043
If Agent Gibbs
would even consider

02:58.086 --> 02:59.608
being my best man, I swear,

02:59.652 --> 03:01.304
I would have a field day.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.608
Good morning, Gibbs.

03:02.652 --> 03:03.913
GIBBS: Got a dead Marine
lieutenant in Reston.

03:03.956 --> 03:04.956
Dead Marine
lieutenant in Reston.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.434
Garth Road Park.Garth Road Park.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.304
I know the place.

03:07.347 --> 03:09.260
Okay, shall we
pick you up?

03:09.304 --> 03:11.130
Nope. Meet you there.ZIVA: Oh.

03:11.173 --> 03:12.956
All right.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.521
He will meet us there.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.652
Where is he?

03:16.695 --> 03:18.391
Did not say.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.000
Hmm.
Hmm.

03:26.565 --> 03:27.652
Morning.

03:27.695 --> 03:29.521
Good morning.

03:29.565 --> 03:30.913
Do you have any coffee?

03:32.956 --> 03:35.086
No.

03:35.130 --> 03:36.434
[chuckles]:
No.

03:36.478 --> 03:37.956
I stop for it.

03:39.608 --> 03:40.956
I didn't mean to wake you.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.695
Oh, you didn't, you didn't.

03:42.739 --> 03:45.260
The sun--
so pretty in that room.

03:46.913 --> 03:48.521
Somebody else used to say that.

03:48.565 --> 03:50.608
Hm.

03:50.652 --> 03:52.565
I thought you had to take
Parker to school.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.521
Mm-mm.

03:54.565 --> 03:58.043
My sister was gonna do it.

03:58.086 --> 04:00.434
I don't want to
rock the boat.

04:00.478 --> 04:02.043
[chuckles]:
It's too late for that.

04:02.086 --> 04:04.608
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

04:04.652 --> 04:06.652
[both laugh]

04:06.695 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, Doc, I can't;
I got a case.

04:09.043 --> 04:12.217
Oh, no, I have a meeting
at the Pentagon.
Okay.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.608
You know, your car--
you blocked me in last night.

04:14.652 --> 04:16.086
I, uh...

04:16.130 --> 04:18.130
didn't want you
to get cold feet.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.173
My house.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.652
No place else to go.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.347
The diner, the office,
anywhere easier.

04:24.391 --> 04:25.782
I think we did okay.

04:25.826 --> 04:26.956
We did great.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.478
Practice makes perfect.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.695
Oh, what have
we here, Jethro?

04:38.739 --> 04:41.956
What we have here
is no Jethro.

04:42.000 --> 04:42.956
What?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.565
He's actually running late.

04:44.608 --> 04:45.869
Whoa.
[chuckles]

04:45.913 --> 04:47.782
There's a first.

04:47.826 --> 04:50.565
Sort of like wearing fuchsia
and lime green to a crime scene.

04:50.608 --> 04:52.565
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't
have time to change.

04:52.608 --> 04:55.478
Perhaps those colors will
raise the dead, Mr. Palmer.

04:55.521 --> 04:57.434
Yeah. Poor guy.

04:57.478 --> 04:58.652
Looks like a pretzel.

04:58.695 --> 05:00.652
An "a salted" pretzel?

05:00.695 --> 05:03.608
Sadly, I had my share of
that when I was seconded

05:03.652 --> 05:05.608
to the parachute
regiment.

05:05.652 --> 05:06.956
Crushed on impact.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.043
Dropped from a
great height.

05:09.086 --> 05:10.260
Yeah.

05:10.304 --> 05:12.043
Well, with all these
broken bones,

05:12.086 --> 05:14.086
he definitely reached
terminal velocity.

05:14.130 --> 05:17.086
Which means he could've fallen
anywhere between

05:17.130 --> 05:19.304
400 and several thousand feet.

05:19.347 --> 05:21.652
I'm guessing it wasn't
his choice, Duck.

05:21.695 --> 05:23.304
Check local
air traffic.

05:23.347 --> 05:25.521
All flights,
commercial and private.

05:25.565 --> 05:26.478
On it, boss.

05:26.521 --> 05:28.217
DUCKY:
Welcome, Jethro.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.217
All is well?

05:29.260 --> 05:30.217
GIBBS:
Not for him.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.347
You got an I.D.?

05:31.391 --> 05:33.478
Yeah, First Lieutenant
Walter Larabee.

05:33.521 --> 05:35.652
Still awaiting confirmation
on his recent assignments.

05:35.695 --> 05:36.956
Cause of death?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.695
[chuckles]
You got to be kidding.

05:40.521 --> 05:44.478
Well, uh, stabbed,
blunt-force trauma,

05:44.521 --> 05:45.913
shot...
McGEE:
Not to mention the whole

05:45.956 --> 05:46.956
plummeted to the earth thing.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.826
Oh, hey.
Something in his pocket.

05:53.608 --> 05:54.739
A challenge coin.

05:57.739 --> 05:59.521
U.S. Navy
Chaplains Corps.

05:59.565 --> 06:01.608
Larabee's a Marine,
he's not a chaplain.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.391
Well, whoever gave him
the coin obviously is.

06:03.434 --> 06:04.608
It's caked with blood.

06:04.652 --> 06:06.434
Along with the rest of him.

06:06.478 --> 06:08.913
No, this blood is dry
and the pocket's clean.

06:08.956 --> 06:11.739
Abby will have to confirm
as much,

06:11.782 --> 06:15.782
but I predict that this is
not the lieutenant's blood.

06:15.826 --> 06:17.434
Think it's a message, boss?

06:17.478 --> 06:19.043
Loud and clear.

06:25.043 --> 06:26.913
Agent Gibbs, Chaplain Burke
had nothing but good things

06:26.956 --> 06:28.565
to say about you and your team.

06:28.608 --> 06:30.304
It's nice to put a
face to the name.

06:30.347 --> 06:32.869
Yeah, well, Burke had her hands
full with us a few months back.

06:32.913 --> 06:35.521
But we're glad to
have you onboard.

06:35.565 --> 06:36.521
Thank you.

06:36.565 --> 06:39.043
What can I do for you?

06:44.956 --> 06:47.565
Don't generally carry
challenge coins,

06:47.608 --> 06:49.043
but some chaplains
do make their own.

06:49.086 --> 06:50.173
Where'd you get this?

06:50.217 --> 06:52.173
Off the body of a
dead Marine officer.

06:52.217 --> 06:53.695
First Lieutenant
Walter Larabee.

06:53.739 --> 06:55.565
Don't know the name.

06:55.608 --> 06:57.130
How about this woman?

06:58.478 --> 07:00.826
Commander Wade, of course.

07:00.869 --> 07:03.347
You're saying this is hers?

07:03.391 --> 07:04.826
Afraid that's
her blood.

07:06.521 --> 07:08.565
Theresa-- is she dead?

07:09.608 --> 07:10.565
Don't know.

07:10.608 --> 07:11.826
Hoping you could help.

07:11.869 --> 07:13.391
Chaplain Wade has served
multiple tours

07:13.434 --> 07:15.043
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

07:15.086 --> 07:18.565
About a month ago, she left on a
relief mission to South America.

07:18.608 --> 07:20.130
Where?
Cartagena.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.608
On a hospital ship.

07:21.652 --> 07:23.347
She joined a group
of Navy corpsmen

07:23.391 --> 07:26.391
working with missionaries
to provide free immunizations

07:26.434 --> 07:28.565
to villagers
in the local mountains.

07:28.608 --> 07:30.739
I had a feeling.

07:30.782 --> 07:33.086
We spoke to Theresa
just last week.

07:33.130 --> 07:34.826
She said everything
was going well.

07:34.869 --> 07:37.869
But we haven't been able
to reach her since.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.130
[cell phone ringing]

07:42.173 --> 07:44.695
Yeah, Duck?

07:44.739 --> 07:46.043
DUCKY: I have preliminary
findings for you...

07:46.086 --> 07:48.000
On my way down.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.782
Can you stick around?

07:55.826 --> 07:59.130
Until we find her,
I'm all yours.

08:05.260 --> 08:06.695
[door shuts]

08:06.739 --> 08:08.826
JIMMY:
We don't expect everyone
to wear the tuxes.

08:08.869 --> 08:10.739
We just really want
to make it fun.

08:10.782 --> 08:15.347
Yes, well, weddings can
be such dismal affairs.

08:15.391 --> 08:17.217
[chuckles]:
Mr. Palmer,

08:17.260 --> 08:19.695
your generation is not
the first to use irony.

08:19.739 --> 08:21.086
Then you'll
wear the tux?

08:21.130 --> 08:23.043
Of course!

08:23.086 --> 08:25.434
No matter what position
you're asked to fill?

08:25.478 --> 08:28.086
Oh, please, say you're not
considering me as your best man.

08:28.130 --> 08:30.434
Well, I-I was
thinking...

08:30.478 --> 08:34.869
Mr. Palmer, I would no sooner
care to plan your bachelor party

08:34.913 --> 08:37.652
than I would actively seek
a root canal.

08:37.695 --> 08:41.782
But that's not to say
that I am not deeply honored.

08:41.826 --> 08:46.565
But take my advice:
mentors make terrible wingmen.

08:46.608 --> 08:51.869
And I won't be the least bit
hurt if you ask someone else.

08:51.913 --> 08:54.043
Spoken like a
true mentor.

08:54.086 --> 08:56.782
Thank you, Doctor, that
actually helps out a lot.

08:56.826 --> 08:58.391
Talk to me, Duck.

08:58.434 --> 09:01.913
Allow me to work my way from
the horrific to the curious.

09:01.956 --> 09:03.478
Horrific?

09:03.521 --> 09:07.043
Yes, well, after being actually
beaten, stabbed and shot,

09:07.086 --> 09:11.739
the lieutenant here showed
he had blood in his lungs,

09:11.782 --> 09:13.391
which indicates
he was still alive

09:13.434 --> 09:15.695
when he was thrown
from the aircraft.

09:15.739 --> 09:18.782
Yes, this bullet was
lodged in his vest.

09:18.826 --> 09:22.869
And these are something for
which I have no explanation.

09:22.913 --> 09:26.043
Yeah, the curious.

09:26.086 --> 09:28.521
Yeah, well, as I took the
tape from off his mouth,

09:28.565 --> 09:30.608
I saw them lodged
in his throat.

09:30.652 --> 09:32.347
I believe they are

09:32.391 --> 09:33.782
tiny fungi.

09:33.826 --> 09:34.913
Another message.

09:34.956 --> 09:36.130
From where?

09:36.173 --> 09:38.434
Well, that is for Ms.
Sciuto to determine.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.130
JIMMY: I think it's fair to say
that Abby is about to have

09:41.173 --> 09:42.739
a fungus among us.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.652
[snickering]

09:47.478 --> 09:49.478
It's a slow burn.
You'll get it later.

09:52.695 --> 09:54.826
TONY:
Trust me, I see it.

09:54.869 --> 09:58.739
But Jimmy looks at me as
a kind of older brother figure,

09:58.782 --> 10:00.695
and I think I'm the only
logical choice.

10:00.739 --> 10:02.347
Well, if it's
a question of logic,

10:02.391 --> 10:04.043
then McGee would make
the perfect best man.

10:04.086 --> 10:05.782
I mean, he and
Jimmy are both

10:05.826 --> 10:08.043
highly intelligent and
conscientious and...

10:08.086 --> 10:08.869
Dull.

10:08.913 --> 10:10.652
Are you kidding me?

10:10.695 --> 10:12.521
McGee's idea of
an incredible party

10:12.565 --> 10:14.956
is a bunch of free corn nuts
and an Xbox marathon.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.434
Sounds pretty good to me.

10:16.478 --> 10:17.782
GIBBS:
Pretty good's not

10:17.826 --> 10:19.478
good enough, McGee. Go.

10:19.521 --> 10:24.000
Marine First Lieutenant
Walter Larabee, 32 years old,

10:24.043 --> 10:26.434
recently finished
his second tour in Afghanistan.

10:26.478 --> 10:29.652
According to his wife, he
accepted a third overseas tour

10:29.695 --> 10:31.826
last month, but this time
to Colombia, South America,

10:31.869 --> 10:34.043
because he thought it would be
safer working at the embassy.

10:34.086 --> 10:36.260
Yeah, well, so much for that.

10:36.304 --> 10:37.608
And there had been
financial hardships,

10:37.652 --> 10:39.043
and with his wife
expecting their first child,

10:39.086 --> 10:40.739
he simply wanted to
be closer to home.

10:40.782 --> 10:41.782
What was the air traffic?

10:41.826 --> 10:43.565
McGee.

10:43.608 --> 10:44.695
TONY: The FAA shows
three aircraft

10:44.739 --> 10:45.782
near the park's airspace

10:45.826 --> 10:47.347
when the lieutenant
took a header.

10:47.391 --> 10:49.739
The first one was
a medical transport chopper;

10:49.782 --> 10:52.521
the second was
a retired Air Force pilot

10:52.565 --> 10:54.260
taking his family
on vacation to Georgia;

10:54.304 --> 10:55.739
but the third one:

10:55.782 --> 10:59.608
a single-engine Cessna
registered to Alfred Holbrook,

10:59.652 --> 11:02.869
who was busted 30 years ago for
possession with intent to sell.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.652
You two find Holbrook,
find his plane.

11:04.695 --> 11:05.869
Search both of 'em.

11:05.913 --> 11:08.000
TONY:
On it, boss.

11:11.739 --> 11:15.652
Might help to know what
you boys are looking for.

11:15.695 --> 11:18.869
Whoa, wow, uh,

11:18.913 --> 11:20.782
the usual-- blood,

11:20.826 --> 11:22.478
duct tape,
mysterious fungus.

11:22.521 --> 11:23.521
Excuse me?

11:23.565 --> 11:24.913
You flew your plane
over Reston

11:24.956 --> 11:26.434
this morning, Mr. Holbrook.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.826
Don't I wish.

11:27.869 --> 11:31.260
I haven't flown for over
a year, for obvious reasons.

11:31.304 --> 11:32.913
No hand controls
in that thing?
I've had
enough trouble

11:32.956 --> 11:35.043
trying to learn these controls
since the accident.

11:35.086 --> 11:36.043
I see.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.826
And when was that?

11:37.869 --> 11:39.695
A year and two months ago.

11:39.739 --> 11:43.347
Drunk driver T-boned me,
and here I am.

11:43.391 --> 11:45.043
I keep her
looking good, but

11:45.086 --> 11:47.173
this beauty's been grounded
since then.

11:47.217 --> 11:49.521
Air Traffic says otherwise.

11:49.565 --> 11:51.956
FAA records
don't lie.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.173
You fellas know how often
people steal licenses

11:54.217 --> 11:56.086
and aircraft control signs?

11:56.130 --> 11:57.956
It's as common
as credit card theft.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.521
Hell, I'm the victim here.

11:59.565 --> 12:01.130
Victim with a drug record.

12:04.347 --> 12:06.304
That was a lifetime ago.

12:06.347 --> 12:08.782
Look, someone
wants you to think

12:08.826 --> 12:11.043
that was us up there
this morning.

12:11.086 --> 12:14.304
I don't go, she don't go.

12:14.347 --> 12:16.739
You boys have been duped.

12:18.347 --> 12:20.260
Abbs, talk to me.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.565
[gasps]

12:21.608 --> 12:22.652
Oh.

12:22.695 --> 12:24.478
Namaste,Chaplain.

12:24.521 --> 12:26.043
Namaste.

12:26.086 --> 12:28.782
This really cool Sri Lankan
priest taught me that.

12:28.826 --> 12:31.608
In Sanskrit, it means,
"I bow to you."

12:31.652 --> 12:32.869
Take a bow later.

12:32.913 --> 12:33.956
Too much yabba-yabba.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.391
I don't have
a lot of time, Abbs.

12:35.434 --> 12:36.391
Okay, then,

12:36.434 --> 12:37.695
let's talk bullets,

12:37.739 --> 12:39.739
like the one
that Ducky pulled out of

12:39.782 --> 12:41.478
Lieutenant Larabee's
Kevlar vest.

12:41.521 --> 12:43.434
It comes from a Russian

12:43.478 --> 12:45.260
VEPR AK-47.

12:45.304 --> 12:46.869
So the Russians could
be involved in this?

12:46.913 --> 12:49.739
Da--well, maybe da.

12:49.782 --> 12:51.652
What about the mushrooms?

12:51.695 --> 12:52.913
Oh, that's
way simpler.

12:52.956 --> 12:55.043
The fungus inside the
lieutenant's throat

12:55.086 --> 12:57.391
was Fusarium oxysporum.

12:57.434 --> 13:00.043
It's an herbicide that's used
to eradicate the coca plant,

13:00.086 --> 13:02.391
but it's only used
in one region--

13:02.434 --> 13:05.173
Nariño, Colombia.

13:05.217 --> 13:08.086
Chaplain Wade mentioned Nariño
in our last phone call.

13:08.130 --> 13:10.347
She and the group
were headed there.

13:10.391 --> 13:12.260
It's dangerous
cartel country.

13:12.304 --> 13:13.695
ABBY:
So

13:13.739 --> 13:16.434
the question is,
how are the chaplain

13:16.478 --> 13:19.217
and Lieutenant Larabee
connected together?

13:28.173 --> 13:30.130
Ziva, do you have
a minute?

13:30.173 --> 13:31.695
What do you know
about Colombia, Jimmy?

13:31.739 --> 13:34.869
Oh, gosh, uh, it's a great
school-- New York City.

13:34.913 --> 13:36.782
Uh, no, not that Colombia.
Make it fast.

13:36.826 --> 13:38.086
I'm waiting to hear
back from a friend.

13:38.130 --> 13:39.521
I was wondering
if you had an opinion

13:39.565 --> 13:41.478
on who should be
my best man.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.043
See, I don't want
to offend anybody.

13:43.086 --> 13:44.391
Y'all are
like family to me.

13:44.434 --> 13:46.826
Well, I cannot recommend
anyone, but, uh,

13:46.869 --> 13:48.173
why not go with your gut?

13:48.217 --> 13:50.695
It seems to do wonders
for Gibbs, and...

13:50.739 --> 13:52.043
McGEE:
Ziva.

13:52.086 --> 13:53.782
There's a phone call
for you in MTAC.

13:53.826 --> 13:55.173
Ah!

13:55.217 --> 13:56.869
My message got through.

13:56.913 --> 13:57.869
[chuckles]

13:57.913 --> 13:59.608
It did.

13:59.652 --> 14:01.652
My gut.

14:01.695 --> 14:04.000
Where is she?

14:04.043 --> 14:05.695
Lost visual.

14:05.739 --> 14:09.217
Didn't know you had old
friends in Cartagena.

14:09.260 --> 14:11.217
South America becomes you,
Monique.

14:11.260 --> 14:12.652
Long time, no contact.

14:12.695 --> 14:15.304
So, word in
the jungle is,

14:15.347 --> 14:17.739
your Marines lost
a lieutenant

14:17.782 --> 14:20.521
and your Navy is
missing a chaplain.

14:20.565 --> 14:22.043
Commander Theresa Wade.

14:22.086 --> 14:23.391
Do you know her?

14:23.434 --> 14:27.913
No... but I might know
how to find her.

14:34.347 --> 14:36.478
Exactly why are you
down in Colombia, Monique?

14:36.521 --> 14:38.478
Just reclaiming
my soul.

14:38.521 --> 14:40.043
Part of a school
construction project

14:40.086 --> 14:42.869
for the Quimbayas
in the Highlands.

14:42.913 --> 14:46.478
It's there I heard
the cartels had taken Americans.

14:46.521 --> 14:48.130
Reliable sources?

14:48.173 --> 14:50.391
Reliable as any
in these parts,

14:50.434 --> 14:52.521
and we have not
been introduced.

14:52.565 --> 14:54.086
Agent Monique Lisson,

14:54.130 --> 14:57.652
meet Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

14:57.695 --> 14:59.043
Ah...

14:59.086 --> 15:01.043
the legendary Gibbs.

15:01.086 --> 15:02.826
I hear good things,

15:02.869 --> 15:05.695
but Ziva never mentioned
how handsome you are.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.086
What type of
agent, Lisson?

15:09.130 --> 15:11.260
Interpol until recently.

15:11.304 --> 15:14.478
And since then, available
for anyone who would have me.

15:14.521 --> 15:17.956
You were saying you might know
Chaplain Wade's whereabouts?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.304
Yes, fortunately,
my Interpol clearance

15:20.347 --> 15:21.695
is still valid.

15:21.739 --> 15:24.304
Managed to recover this
from the Cartagena Police.

15:24.347 --> 15:27.869
You may recognize your
chaplain in the foreground.

15:27.913 --> 15:30.608
GIBBS:
That's Larabee with her.

15:30.652 --> 15:31.652
What's written on the van?

15:33.521 --> 15:35.478
ZIVA:
Courage Mission
International.

15:35.521 --> 15:36.695
They provide medical aid

15:36.739 --> 15:39.260
to the Santa Maria
mountain communities--

15:39.304 --> 15:41.434
vaccinations, antibiotics.

15:41.478 --> 15:43.608
And the cartels
prefer they didn't?

15:43.652 --> 15:45.260
They don't like outsiders.

15:45.304 --> 15:48.652
They knew Americans were here
the moment they reached port.

15:48.695 --> 15:51.347
According to DEA
active investigations,

15:51.391 --> 15:55.043
the Lazaro Cartel operates
coca farms in that area.

15:55.086 --> 15:56.043
And the rebels work

15:56.086 --> 15:57.869
hand in hand
with the cartels.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.347
It's a pretty big gamble,

15:59.391 --> 16:01.043
kidnapping U.S. Navy personnel.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.478
They're hoping
she has information.

16:02.521 --> 16:04.043
Wade's merely a chaplain,
not Navy Intelligence.

16:04.086 --> 16:05.608
She's still Navy.

16:05.652 --> 16:06.956
It's probably the only reason
she's still alive.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.652
For how long?

16:11.304 --> 16:14.000
You up for some
company, Lisson?

16:14.043 --> 16:16.173
Thought you would never ask,
Gibbs.

16:16.217 --> 16:17.913
Not me.

16:17.956 --> 16:19.956
Her.

16:21.086 --> 16:23.260
ZIVA:
Gibbs, this woman is like

16:23.304 --> 16:24.608
the big sister I never had.

16:24.652 --> 16:26.043
I trust her with my life.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.869
Having anyone else there
will just be dead weight.

16:28.913 --> 16:29.782
DiNozzo.

16:29.826 --> 16:31.347
Securing transport now, boss.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.869
McGee and I will
work from here.

16:32.913 --> 16:34.956
Agent Lisson is
all the help I need.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.434
We work like peas
in a poke,

16:36.478 --> 16:38.000
like yogurt
and garlic, like...

16:38.043 --> 16:39.043
TONY:
Thanks.

16:39.086 --> 16:40.608
McGEE:
There's pigs in a poke

16:40.652 --> 16:41.956
and there's peas
in a pod, but...

16:42.000 --> 16:43.565
Yogurt and garlic?!

16:43.608 --> 16:44.869
It's a Middle Eastern
staple.

16:44.913 --> 16:45.956
TONY: Which I'm sure
we're gonna find

16:46.000 --> 16:47.347
in all the best
Colombian restaurants.

16:47.391 --> 16:48.869
I speak fluent Spanish,

16:48.913 --> 16:49.956
if Agent DiNozzo needs
a translator.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.956
TONY:
A translator?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.043
Excuse me, uh, Chaplain,

16:54.086 --> 16:56.478
I may not speak
as many languages as my

16:56.521 --> 17:00.130
Israeli cohort here, but I
assure you yo hablo español

17:00.173 --> 17:01.608
muy perfectamente.

17:01.652 --> 17:03.086
I meant nothing by it.

17:03.130 --> 17:05.608
It's just that you seem--
how do I put this?

17:05.652 --> 17:06.652
Less worldly?

17:06.695 --> 17:08.173
More monolingual.

17:08.217 --> 17:09.565
Well put, Chaplain.

17:09.608 --> 17:12.565
Look, that was Chaplain Wade's
brother on the phone.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.130
I promised him
every effort

17:14.173 --> 17:16.086
was being made
to find Theresa.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.565
That's why
I'd like to go, too.

17:17.608 --> 17:19.478
Oh, this is just
getting better.

17:19.521 --> 17:22.086
Got it covered, Chaplain.
No dice.

17:22.130 --> 17:23.260
Agent Gibbs, I'm sure
I can be of assistance.

17:23.304 --> 17:24.782
I understand.
No, you don't.

17:28.608 --> 17:30.565
Forgive me.

17:30.608 --> 17:32.913
It's just...

17:32.956 --> 17:35.652
I need to do this.
Please.

17:40.565 --> 17:44.521
Fine, then she'll be
his responsibility.

17:44.565 --> 17:45.782
Sure thing, Ziva.

17:45.826 --> 17:47.478
Anything to keep from
being a dead weight.

17:53.695 --> 17:55.652
Ah, you moonlighting?

17:55.695 --> 17:58.304
You dress pretty nice for
a pizza delivery girl.

17:58.347 --> 17:59.608
Parker and I went
out for pizza.

17:59.652 --> 18:00.913
We thought
you might like some.

18:00.956 --> 18:02.434
He's down in the car.

18:02.478 --> 18:04.000
Still haven't met him.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.304
Yeah, not yet.

18:05.347 --> 18:06.739
Anyway, he's doing
homework.

18:06.782 --> 18:08.478
How's the case?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.652
I can't talk about it.

18:10.695 --> 18:12.217
Colombia.

18:12.260 --> 18:14.217
Doc, if you know the answer,
why ask?I-I'm sorry.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.000
I'm sorry, really, I-- it's--
I can't help myself, it's just

18:17.043 --> 18:18.565
brain-gamer stuff.

18:20.478 --> 18:23.565
Oh, this looks
like fun.

18:23.608 --> 18:25.130
I haven't done this
since the '80s.

18:25.173 --> 18:27.652
What does DoD know
about Wade and Larabee?

18:27.695 --> 18:29.478
They know she's missing,
they know he's dead,

18:29.521 --> 18:31.521
and they know
you're handling it.

18:32.956 --> 18:36.391
And looking really handsome
in the process.

18:36.434 --> 18:38.434
[Ryan sighing]

18:40.913 --> 18:44.173
Son, car-- gotta go.

18:44.217 --> 18:46.826
I'm not real hungry.

18:46.869 --> 18:48.217
Open it.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.260
It's good for you.

19:06.695 --> 19:09.347
[Tony panting]

19:11.434 --> 19:14.130
Seriously, Ziva, is this
the best your friend could do?

19:14.173 --> 19:15.478
A low profile is everything.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.478
Our security is
her first concern.

19:17.521 --> 19:19.608
Maybe hygiene could be
a close second?

19:19.652 --> 19:21.739
¿Señor, solamente un cuarto?

19:21.782 --> 19:23.478
Esto es todo lo que tenemos disponible.

19:23.521 --> 19:25.695
Somos tres
personas.

19:25.739 --> 19:26.826
[man speaking
Spanish]

19:26.869 --> 19:28.434
[speaking
Spanish]

19:28.478 --> 19:30.652
We only have one room.TONY:
Well, ladies,

19:30.695 --> 19:32.695
so began a spring break
they'd never forget.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.043
I doubt we will
be here much.

19:37.304 --> 19:38.608
Chaplain.

19:38.652 --> 19:41.347
[whistles]

19:41.391 --> 19:43.130
Oh, no, no.
Uh, gracias.

19:43.173 --> 19:45.043
Señor,no,
no, no, no.

19:45.086 --> 19:46.043
It's all right.

19:47.695 --> 19:49.652
Oh, right.

19:49.695 --> 19:53.913
Uh... I only have
the big bills.

19:53.956 --> 19:55.086
¿Uh, tiene cambio?

19:55.130 --> 19:56.086
Sí. Yeah?

19:56.130 --> 19:58.130
Excuse me.

20:02.913 --> 20:04.695
He said he's gonna
get me change.

20:04.739 --> 20:06.173
Oh, yeah. Sure he is.

20:09.695 --> 20:11.695
You know what Monique would
say if, uh, she were here?

20:11.739 --> 20:12.695
Better safe...

20:12.739 --> 20:15.260
Better safe
than spoiled.

20:15.304 --> 20:16.695
You remembered.

20:20.173 --> 20:21.826
[exhales]

20:21.869 --> 20:23.478
Wow, that, uh,

20:23.521 --> 20:25.217
little guy is faster
than he looks.

20:25.869 --> 20:27.434
Agent Monique Lisson,

20:27.478 --> 20:29.260
NCIS Special Agent
Tony DiNozzo.

20:29.304 --> 20:30.521
Wow.

20:30.565 --> 20:32.434
Uh, never mind.

20:32.478 --> 20:33.478
Ay, caramba.

20:33.521 --> 20:35.652
How do you
concentrate, Ziva,

20:35.695 --> 20:37.695
with so many
attractive men around?

20:38.565 --> 20:42.000
It's easier than you think.

20:42.043 --> 20:43.347
Meet Chaplain Maria Castro.

20:43.391 --> 20:44.391
She is a dear colleague

20:44.434 --> 20:46.000
of Chaplain Wade.

20:46.043 --> 20:48.173
We will do our best
to find your friend.

20:48.217 --> 20:49.434
The sooner the better.

20:49.478 --> 20:51.347
Sooner is not possible.

20:51.391 --> 20:53.521
The only safe time to
travel out to the villages

20:53.565 --> 20:54.478
is in darkness.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.782
Which is not for
several hours.

20:58.565 --> 21:00.521
Who's hungry?

21:00.565 --> 21:02.608
This hotel may be
less than impressive,

21:02.652 --> 21:06.565
but it makes the
best arepas in town.

21:06.608 --> 21:08.956
I do love hot arepas.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.608
What else do you love,
Agent DiNozzo?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.956
Excuse me.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.391
Manny Varigan?

21:19.434 --> 21:23.000
I'm NCIS Special
Agent Timothy McGee.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Hey!

21:31.608 --> 21:32.869
[grunts]

21:36.478 --> 21:38.043
Did you hurt your green thumb?

21:38.086 --> 21:40.478
[sighs]

21:40.521 --> 21:41.956
Manny, huh?

21:42.000 --> 21:46.086
You sure it's, uh,
not, Javier Ramos?

21:46.130 --> 21:49.043
Or Miguel Martinez?

21:49.086 --> 21:50.826
I don't choose
my aliases.

21:50.869 --> 21:52.695
They're given to me.

21:52.739 --> 21:56.652
DEA, FBI, CIA.

21:56.695 --> 21:58.000
Is that how it works?

21:58.043 --> 22:00.434
You work in a tree nursery
in between flights?

22:00.478 --> 22:02.565
You get busted
for running coca,

22:02.608 --> 22:04.434
then you help our guys
catch bigger fish?

22:04.478 --> 22:06.695
Not anymore.

22:06.739 --> 22:08.260
I got a family now.

22:08.304 --> 22:10.478
Right, right. Well,
you still got to provide, right?

22:10.521 --> 22:12.347
How much

22:12.391 --> 22:14.043
to do a run out of Cartagena?

22:14.086 --> 22:17.652
These days... $50,000.

22:17.695 --> 22:19.652
Only 50?
The recession.

22:19.695 --> 22:21.304
[laughs]

22:21.347 --> 22:26.043
Well, yesterday, a U.S. Marine's
body dropped out of an airplane.

22:26.086 --> 22:27.869
Was that you?

22:27.913 --> 22:29.826
Hey, I know nothing about that.

22:29.869 --> 22:31.043
Okay, so I'm a mule,

22:31.086 --> 22:33.347
but not with drugs,
and not for the cartels.

22:33.391 --> 22:34.565
For who?

22:34.608 --> 22:35.826
I told you.

22:35.869 --> 22:37.695
CIA gives me aliases
for the flight records.

22:37.739 --> 22:40.217
They don't want anybody knowing
about the shipments.

22:40.260 --> 22:42.304
Shipments of what?

22:44.652 --> 22:46.478
I flew down empty.

22:46.521 --> 22:48.391
I flew back
with medical ice chests,

22:48.434 --> 22:51.565
coolers sealed up tight,

22:51.608 --> 22:52.913
but I got a look once.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.652
They got these
little tubes inside,

22:54.695 --> 22:56.782
like when the doctor
takes your blood.
Samples.

22:56.826 --> 22:58.260
Bunches of them.

22:58.304 --> 23:01.000
I flew them to an airstrip
in Virginia, a lady took them,

23:01.043 --> 23:02.478
and I walked with 50 large.

23:02.521 --> 23:04.434
What lady?
For that money,
I don't ask.

23:04.478 --> 23:06.347
And I haven't done it
for months.

23:06.391 --> 23:07.826
Know nothing
about any Marine, either.

23:07.869 --> 23:09.391
I didn't fly yesterday.

23:10.652 --> 23:11.695
I can prove it.

23:14.826 --> 23:19.086
The first time I met Ziva,
I knew she was special.

23:19.130 --> 23:21.086
Different than other
Mossads I've known.

23:21.130 --> 23:24.130
She was fearless and strong,

23:24.173 --> 23:26.043
and wise beyond her years.

23:26.086 --> 23:28.173
And honest.

23:28.217 --> 23:29.521
Sometimes too honest.

23:29.565 --> 23:31.173
Well, some things
never change.

23:31.217 --> 23:32.913
[Ziva chuckles]

23:32.956 --> 23:36.086
Well, Tony knows I'm a terrible
liar, but next to Monique here,

23:36.130 --> 23:37.391
I look even worse.

23:37.434 --> 23:39.043
A diamond could crack
before she would.

23:39.086 --> 23:41.304
Steely nerves, this one.

23:41.347 --> 23:43.608
TONY:
Steely Dan.

23:43.652 --> 23:45.608
Nerves of steel.CASTRO:
So, Agent Lisson,

23:45.652 --> 23:47.478
what made you decide
to focus your talents elsewhere?

23:47.521 --> 23:49.608
Well, since I chose
not to be a wife

23:49.652 --> 23:52.869
or mother, I have the freedom
to go wherever I please.

23:52.913 --> 23:55.652
TONY: And you said that
you're retired now, right?

23:55.695 --> 23:57.173
And that you like
the south of France?

23:57.217 --> 23:59.869
So why aren't you in Provence
growing lavender, Monique?

23:59.913 --> 24:01.434
Maybe I am.

24:01.478 --> 24:04.608
ZIVA: Monique has a
strong ethic, Tony.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.478
She believes
in giving back.

24:06.521 --> 24:08.826
Don't make me sound
so noble, Ziva.

24:10.391 --> 24:12.347
A school needed rebuilding,

24:12.391 --> 24:15.608
and, um, I've been attending
to other things.

24:15.652 --> 24:17.869
So, I'm here
because I'm needed.

24:17.913 --> 24:21.521
And in six months...
who knows?

24:23.826 --> 24:24.782
Monique...

24:25.695 --> 24:26.478
We have company.

24:35.130 --> 24:36.869
Stay down!

24:40.086 --> 24:42.043
You think they know we're here?

24:50.173 --> 24:51.782
Give me the status.

24:51.826 --> 24:53.695
Alive and accounted for, boss.

24:53.739 --> 24:55.130
What's the security detail
at the hotel?

24:55.173 --> 24:57.260
Local Force Protection
Detachment.

24:57.304 --> 24:59.260
Plain-clothed,
doors and rooftops.

24:59.304 --> 25:01.391
Whomever is responsible
has been watching

25:01.434 --> 25:03.130
and knows your
people are here.

25:03.173 --> 25:05.217
Well, they could have been
watching you, too, Lisson.

25:05.260 --> 25:07.260
I took precautions.

25:07.304 --> 25:08.695
Really?

25:08.739 --> 25:11.434
Well, in that case,
maybe Mata Hari here

25:11.478 --> 25:13.086
could have told us
a little earlier

25:13.130 --> 25:14.782
about a possible carload
of gun-toting cartel zombies.

25:14.826 --> 25:16.869
LISSON:
I didn't think

25:16.913 --> 25:18.478
it was necessary to
state the obvious.

25:18.521 --> 25:21.043
DiNozzo?

25:21.086 --> 25:22.434
Who's to say
she can be trusted?

25:22.478 --> 25:23.869
Are you kidding me, DiNozzo?!

25:23.913 --> 25:25.260
No, I'm not.

25:25.304 --> 25:27.304
Look, I know you
and Agent Monique went all

25:27.347 --> 25:29.260
Costa Rican
bikini party last year,

25:29.304 --> 25:31.652
but as far as I'm concerned,
she's still inter-mole.

25:31.695 --> 25:32.652
I knew this was a mistake.

25:32.695 --> 25:34.217
Knock it off!

25:34.260 --> 25:36.260
DiNozzo.

25:36.304 --> 25:38.565
Yeah, boss.

25:38.608 --> 25:41.130
How is Chaplain Castro
holding up?

25:41.173 --> 25:42.478
Shaken.

25:42.521 --> 25:44.565
You watch
your six.

25:44.608 --> 25:47.173
You protect each other's
rear ends.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.217
[sighs]

25:59.434 --> 26:01.391
Hey.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.434
How you doing?

26:05.956 --> 26:08.304
It's not exactly safe
out here, you know.

26:08.347 --> 26:10.347
I know.

26:11.347 --> 26:12.826
[sighs]

26:12.869 --> 26:14.347
Well...

26:15.391 --> 26:18.000
...you can carry a gun
if you want.

26:18.043 --> 26:19.478
Non-combatant.

26:19.521 --> 26:21.043
I'll deal with it.

26:21.086 --> 26:23.826
Roger that.

26:27.217 --> 26:29.391
Ziva and Agent Lisson--

26:29.434 --> 26:32.130
they're interesting women.

26:32.173 --> 26:36.086
Interesting good,
or interesting bad?

26:36.130 --> 26:38.652
Strong, decisive.

26:38.695 --> 26:40.782
Deliberate.

26:40.826 --> 26:42.043
And alone.

26:42.086 --> 26:43.695
I suppose that
comes with the job.

26:43.739 --> 26:45.565
Doesn't have to.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.565
So why are you
in Cartagena, Castro?

26:52.608 --> 26:54.304
I wanted to help find
a missing chaplain.

26:54.347 --> 26:55.434
Which you could
have done

26:55.478 --> 26:57.000
from the safety of
the Navy Yard, so,

26:57.043 --> 26:59.043
what are you doing
in Cartagena, Castro?

27:04.260 --> 27:06.695
I'm here
because the assignment,

27:06.739 --> 27:09.652
to bring immunizations
to the local villagers,

27:09.695 --> 27:11.173
was supposed to be mine.

27:11.217 --> 27:14.782
Guilt-stricken, party of one.

27:14.826 --> 27:17.565
My father was sick,
I had to go home.

27:17.608 --> 27:19.347
Chaplain Wade took my place.

27:19.391 --> 27:21.173
And you feel responsible?
You think

27:21.217 --> 27:23.173
you should have been the one
that went missing, not her?

27:23.217 --> 27:26.782
Do you know what
I told her brother?

27:26.826 --> 27:29.260
"You have to remember
that Theresa is there

27:29.304 --> 27:31.043
"because she wanted to go.

27:31.086 --> 27:33.347
Because she wanted
to help."

27:33.391 --> 27:35.347
That's not entirely false.

27:35.391 --> 27:37.391
It's not true, either.

27:37.434 --> 27:40.260
Listen.

27:40.304 --> 27:43.347
You can't put that kind
of weight on yourself.

27:43.391 --> 27:45.347
'Cause if you keep piling it on,

27:45.391 --> 27:48.130
one day... you can't move.

27:48.173 --> 27:50.000
Take it from me.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.434
I carry a lot... every day.

27:53.478 --> 27:57.086
So cut yourself some
slack, all right?

28:00.826 --> 28:03.000
Do you think
Chaplain Wade is still alive?

28:05.521 --> 28:07.521
[sighs]

28:09.565 --> 28:11.347
Okay, McGee,
let's go.

28:11.391 --> 28:14.260
Manny Varigan, our green-thumbed
pilot and government mule.

28:14.304 --> 28:15.652
Alibi?

28:15.695 --> 28:17.217
Rock solid.

28:17.260 --> 28:20.478
He was on a class trip with his
son at Ford's Theatre in DC.

28:20.521 --> 28:23.173
42 kids, two teachers
and three parents can attest

28:23.217 --> 28:25.956
to his whereabouts
at the time of the flight.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.391
Why is Ryan
serving him up?

28:27.434 --> 28:29.000
Could have made a mistake.

28:29.043 --> 28:30.521
You want to
tell her that?

28:30.565 --> 28:32.000
Hmm.

28:32.043 --> 28:35.000
Well, plane doesn't exist,
pilot doesn't exist.

28:35.043 --> 28:36.217
What doesexist?

28:36.260 --> 28:38.347
A dead Marine downstairs.

28:42.130 --> 28:44.391
GIBBS:
Pizza got us nowhere.

28:44.434 --> 28:46.347
[sighs]

28:46.391 --> 28:48.260
Got you to the CIA.

28:48.304 --> 28:50.000
So the pilot's a mule.

28:50.043 --> 28:51.173
He alibi'd out.

28:51.217 --> 28:53.304
He didn't kill
Lieutenant Larabee.

28:53.347 --> 28:55.260
And you've known about
Colombia the whole time.

28:55.304 --> 28:57.347
I swear, not until
you got involved.

28:59.608 --> 29:02.000
Look, Gibbs,
I can't help myself.

29:02.043 --> 29:04.391
I hear things,
I start digging.

29:04.434 --> 29:05.739
Whether you're invited or not.

29:05.782 --> 29:07.782
The DoD doesn't need
an invitation.

29:07.826 --> 29:10.304
Navy, Air Force,

29:10.347 --> 29:13.521
Marines-- we have our fingers
in a lot of pots.

29:13.565 --> 29:15.695
Doc,

29:15.739 --> 29:18.260
forget for a second

29:18.304 --> 29:20.260
about what you know.

29:20.304 --> 29:21.782
Tell me what you think.

29:21.826 --> 29:24.391
I think it's possible

29:24.434 --> 29:27.695
that Chaplain Wade and the
Marine stumbled onto something.

29:27.739 --> 29:29.217
They stumbled onto what?

29:31.304 --> 29:32.956
[Ryan sighs]

29:33.000 --> 29:36.130
This operation smells
like trouble to me.

29:36.173 --> 29:37.521
Bring your team home.

29:37.565 --> 29:42.000
If that Navy chaplain
isn't dead yet, she will be.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.521
If these people got
to Larabee and Wade,

29:46.565 --> 29:48.739
what about the missionaries
they were traveling with?

29:48.782 --> 29:50.565
I don't know.

29:50.608 --> 29:53.347
But you'd tell me if you did?

29:53.391 --> 29:55.391
What do you think?

29:58.217 --> 30:01.391
Courage Mission
International, boss.

30:01.434 --> 30:04.347
Their Web site says they
have over a 100 missionaries

30:04.391 --> 30:05.913
working in 22
different countries.

30:05.956 --> 30:07.217
Colombia?

30:07.260 --> 30:08.304
No details.
Nothing specific.

30:08.347 --> 30:09.782
Just a phone number.

30:09.826 --> 30:11.173
Call it.

30:11.217 --> 30:12.391
I already did.

30:12.434 --> 30:14.260
An answering service
picked up.

30:14.304 --> 30:17.173
Said the Cartagena office
was experiencing problems,

30:17.217 --> 30:18.782
and someone would get back
to me.

30:18.826 --> 30:20.478
Find me photos, McGee.

30:20.521 --> 30:21.826
I want faces.

30:21.869 --> 30:23.130
I want to know

30:23.173 --> 30:24.826
who guided our people
into cartel territory.

30:24.869 --> 30:28.173
So you think the cartel flew
the plane that dropped Larabee?

30:28.217 --> 30:30.565
Ah, it's a phony pilot,
it's a phony call sign.

30:30.608 --> 30:33.043
Well, Chaplain Wade's e-mails
mention two civilians.

30:33.086 --> 30:36.217
Stephen Wheeler
and Constance Mazney.

30:36.260 --> 30:37.826
Okay, run 'em.

30:37.869 --> 30:40.869
All right, just one second.

30:40.913 --> 30:42.434
Uh, boss,
something's wrong here.

30:42.478 --> 30:44.260
Wrong how, McGee?

30:44.304 --> 30:47.000
Wheeler and Mazney both have
blocked government files.

30:49.608 --> 30:53.173
Abby, do you have a second?

30:53.217 --> 30:55.347
[sighs] Major Mass Spec
and I are breaking up.

30:55.391 --> 30:56.652
What?! No!

30:56.695 --> 30:58.347
He's misbehaving,

30:58.391 --> 30:59.826
he's just pissing me off.

30:59.869 --> 31:01.695
Hey.

31:01.739 --> 31:03.434
Can I ask you a question?

31:03.478 --> 31:05.347
Sure.

31:05.391 --> 31:09.217
Will you be my best woman?

31:10.260 --> 31:12.000
Oh!

31:12.043 --> 31:13.652
Can I take that as a yes?

31:13.695 --> 31:15.391
Yes!

31:15.434 --> 31:16.913
Yes! I can't wait.

31:16.956 --> 31:18.347
It'll be so much fun.

31:18.391 --> 31:20.173
Bachelor party.
Um, nude ice hockey?

31:20.217 --> 31:21.652
I have so many
ideas right now.

31:21.695 --> 31:23.608
You got 'em, Abbs,
let's hear 'em.

31:23.652 --> 31:26.130
Right. So, I found
the cartel connection

31:26.173 --> 31:27.565
you were looking for.

31:27.608 --> 31:30.347
The Russian AK-47
that killed Larabee--

31:30.391 --> 31:32.347
that is currently
the weapon of choice

31:32.391 --> 31:34.434
for three cartels
in South America.

31:34.478 --> 31:36.695
The Lazaro Cartel
one of 'em?

31:36.739 --> 31:38.173
Number one on the list.

31:38.217 --> 31:40.000
Well, then,
congratulations, Palmer.

31:40.043 --> 31:41.391
You picked the best
Best Man for the job.

31:41.434 --> 31:43.956
You picked
the prettiest one, too.

31:44.000 --> 31:44.956
Thanks, Abbs.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.652
[laughs]

31:47.695 --> 31:50.260
Perhaps the situation
has turned into something

31:50.304 --> 31:52.260
I should handle without you.

31:52.304 --> 31:54.391
What has it turned
into exactly?

31:54.434 --> 31:56.391
Ziva, things change,
people change.

31:56.434 --> 31:57.913
Overnight?

31:57.956 --> 32:00.347
I mean, six months ago, we
were laughing like sisters,

32:00.391 --> 32:03.043
and now I feel like there's
a... a wall between us.

32:03.086 --> 32:04.739
I don't even know you!

32:04.782 --> 32:06.782
I have done something.

32:06.826 --> 32:09.347
I'm involved with something
I cannot get out of.

32:09.391 --> 32:11.565
So you're going
to shut me out?

32:11.608 --> 32:14.000
If it protects you, yes.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.652
The situation
with the chaplain--

32:18.695 --> 32:21.347
there are people involved
you should not cross.

32:21.391 --> 32:22.608
Stop protecting me, Monique.

32:22.652 --> 32:25.695
I can take
care of myself.

32:25.739 --> 32:29.304
I want you to have
all the things I couldn't have.

32:29.347 --> 32:31.391
You should be home
with someone.

32:31.434 --> 32:33.434
I don't want you to look back

32:33.478 --> 32:35.826
on a lifetime
of cold beds and memories.

32:35.869 --> 32:38.043
Uh-uh-uh-uh,
that is not up to you.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.782
This is the life
that I have chosen.

32:40.826 --> 32:43.478
Good or bad, right or wrong,
it is the only one that I know.

32:43.521 --> 32:46.391
This case, like life,
is not all black-and-white.

32:46.434 --> 32:48.478
You have to trust me on this.

32:48.521 --> 32:50.782
Go home with Tony, to your team,

32:50.826 --> 32:53.043
and accept this is a case
you may not solve.

32:53.086 --> 32:56.043
I will not go home empty-handed.

32:56.086 --> 32:58.217
[sighs]

32:58.260 --> 33:00.652
Then you may go home dead.

33:12.347 --> 33:14.173
Oh, wow.

33:14.217 --> 33:15.782
Boss?

33:15.826 --> 33:17.478
Black coffee, McGee.
Drink it.

33:17.521 --> 33:18.913
Oh. Thank you.

33:18.956 --> 33:20.304
I just broke through
the security wall

33:20.347 --> 33:23.086
on the names Stephen Wheeler
and Constance Mazney.

33:23.130 --> 33:26.260
You know, the people that
guided the chaplain and
lieutenant into the mountains.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.217
Well, they are
not missionaries, boss.

33:30.913 --> 33:33.695
They're CIA.

33:34.739 --> 33:36.739
[sighs]

33:44.043 --> 33:46.695
Missionaries or CIA?

33:46.739 --> 33:48.173
I need answers.

33:48.217 --> 33:50.217
Not hints, not riddles--
answers.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.565
Yeah, I've told you
everything I know.

33:52.608 --> 33:53.956
Yeah?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.086
'Cause I know
you been looking, Doc.

33:56.130 --> 33:58.739
What are they after?

34:00.739 --> 34:02.652
Members of the cartel

34:02.695 --> 34:05.913
are getting harder and harder
to track all over South America.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.173
Vaccinations?

34:07.217 --> 34:09.043
A ruse.

34:09.086 --> 34:12.086
I mean, people are getting
inoculated with real medicine--

34:12.130 --> 34:13.391
never a bad thing--

34:13.434 --> 34:15.043
but what we get in return...

34:15.086 --> 34:16.304
Is a blood sample.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.130
Blood means DNA.

34:19.173 --> 34:23.043
Connect the DNA by family,
from village to village,

34:23.086 --> 34:25.434
and you have a road map
to cartel leaders.

34:25.478 --> 34:29.521
It's how we tracked bin Laden.

34:29.565 --> 34:31.478
Did Chaplain Wade

34:31.521 --> 34:33.826
or Lieutenant Larabee
know anything about this?

34:33.869 --> 34:35.782
I don't think so.

34:35.826 --> 34:38.391
Next time, Doc,

34:38.434 --> 34:41.086
loose the pizza box,

34:41.130 --> 34:43.000
tell me straight.

34:43.043 --> 34:45.565
I can't. Not everything.

34:45.608 --> 34:47.391
Yes, you can.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.782
If you knew

34:51.826 --> 34:54.173
the pillow talk I was
capable of, Agent Gibbs,

34:54.217 --> 34:55.565
you would never sleep again.

34:55.608 --> 34:57.260
Oh, you don't give
me enough credit.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.434
You be careful.

34:59.478 --> 35:01.913
I may have to show you
what's behind the curtain.

35:01.956 --> 35:03.173
You want me to guess?

35:03.217 --> 35:05.565
Because I think I got
a pretty good idea.

35:06.608 --> 35:09.565
I'm sorry.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.260
I should've come to you sooner.

35:11.304 --> 35:12.521
You should have.

35:12.565 --> 35:14.130
I know.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.956
From Gibbs.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.347
They are CIA. Now I know.

35:24.391 --> 35:27.043
I knew there was more going on

35:27.086 --> 35:29.347
than medical
outreach.

35:29.391 --> 35:31.043
But still you chose
to say nothing.

35:31.086 --> 35:34.000
Half the missionaries
I encounter

35:34.043 --> 35:35.608
are not what they seem.

35:35.652 --> 35:38.130
It is not always
a cause for alarm.

35:38.173 --> 35:39.347
CASTRO:
Then what is?

35:39.391 --> 35:41.043
A U.S. Marine is dead.

35:41.086 --> 35:42.652
Why did they reach out
to the Chaplain Corps

35:42.695 --> 35:43.869
if there's something more
going on?

35:43.913 --> 35:45.173
They needed a cover.

35:45.217 --> 35:47.826
Who better than a clergywoman
to create one?

35:47.869 --> 35:50.000
Wade and Larabee thought
they were helping people.

35:50.043 --> 35:51.608
They thought
they were saving lives.

35:51.652 --> 35:53.391
What was this
really about?

35:53.434 --> 35:55.434
I wish I had answers.

35:55.478 --> 35:57.347
The best I can do

35:57.391 --> 35:58.652
is promise to find out.

35:58.695 --> 36:00.956
[cocks gun]Well, the best we can do

36:01.000 --> 36:03.043
is find Chaplain Wade
and bring her home.

36:03.086 --> 36:05.434
According to McGee,
the CIA agents responsible,

36:05.478 --> 36:07.043
they're still unaccounted for.

36:07.086 --> 36:09.565
Well, we find them,
we find the chaplain.

36:09.608 --> 36:11.000
I was going to do
it without you.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.173
No, Monique,

36:12.217 --> 36:14.782
now we will do it together.

36:16.043 --> 36:17.956
Wheeler, let me drive.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.043
I know a back road.

36:19.086 --> 36:21.000
Whatever gets us out
of here faster.

36:24.521 --> 36:26.260
[panting]

36:26.304 --> 36:27.956
You're sure the plane's waiting?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.347
You got the same message.

36:29.391 --> 36:31.347
The happy couple
is leaving so soon?

36:31.391 --> 36:33.000
Easy.

36:33.043 --> 36:35.260
We're not tourists.
ZIVA:
We know who you are.

36:35.304 --> 36:37.956
And now you have to answer
for Lieutenant Larabee
and Chaplain Wade.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.434
What are you ladies
talking about?

36:39.478 --> 36:41.956
LISSON: We know what you've been
doing in those mountains.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.347
The blood collection, the DNA.

36:43.391 --> 36:44.652
It's all classified.

36:44.695 --> 36:46.652
WHEELER:
Easy.

36:46.695 --> 36:49.217
We never meant
for the chaplain to find out.

36:49.260 --> 36:51.043
Shut up.
They know.

36:51.086 --> 36:53.043
Con, we're lucky
to be alive.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.869
The cartel's on to
the whole thing. It's over.

36:57.869 --> 37:00.739
Having the chaplain along

37:00.782 --> 37:03.782
helped legitimize
what we were doing.

37:03.826 --> 37:07.043
Lieutenant Larabee was
there for her protection.

37:07.086 --> 37:09.304
As far as they were concerned,
it was what it looked like--

37:09.347 --> 37:11.217
a humanitarian gesture.

37:11.260 --> 37:12.826
They didn't know about the rest.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Who are you two with, anyway?

37:16.043 --> 37:17.000
NCIS.

37:20.086 --> 37:21.608
Okay...

37:22.826 --> 37:25.043
And you were saying?

37:25.086 --> 37:27.956
The cartel made an example
of Lieutenant Larabee.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.043
Dropped him out
of that plane

37:30.086 --> 37:32.043
as a warning to our
bosses back home.

37:32.086 --> 37:34.347
What about the chaplain?
She still alive?

37:34.391 --> 37:36.043
If we thought she was,

37:36.086 --> 37:37.478
do you really think
that we'd be leaving her?

37:37.521 --> 37:39.652
And yet you do not know
for certain and you are here.

37:41.913 --> 37:43.782
Her only chance would be

37:43.826 --> 37:46.521
if the cartels thought
she had any intel to share.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.826
Then let us assume
that she is then.

37:48.869 --> 37:51.652
And if she's still alive,
the CIA had better help.

37:52.695 --> 37:54.913
If we can locate Wade,

37:54.956 --> 37:57.086
what do you guys have in mind?

38:00.913 --> 38:03.086
Bang.

38:04.913 --> 38:06.521
REPORTER:
The blast shook the streets

38:06.565 --> 38:08.695
around the Cartagena
warehouse district.

38:08.739 --> 38:11.739
Although unconfirmed,
this warehouse and another,

38:11.782 --> 38:13.739
also destroyed,
are believed to have been owned

38:13.782 --> 38:15.739
by members of the Lazaro Cartel.

38:15.782 --> 38:17.869
The number of dead
is unknown at this hour,

38:17.913 --> 38:19.043
and the cause of the blast...Freeze it.

38:19.086 --> 38:22.043
McGee, the GPS device
DiNozzo planted

38:22.086 --> 38:24.869
on our CIA amigos...

38:25.913 --> 38:28.000
Coming in loud
and clear.

38:28.043 --> 38:30.043
Two blocks away.
They did it.

38:30.086 --> 38:31.130
They delivered the explosion.

38:31.173 --> 38:33.000
Get me a rescue status.

38:33.043 --> 38:35.130
McGEE: That's our guys
calling us.

38:35.173 --> 38:36.347
Put it up.

38:39.434 --> 38:40.869
Gibbs, can you hear us?

38:40.913 --> 38:41.739
Go, Ziva.

38:41.782 --> 38:43.913
Elvis was in the building.

38:45.086 --> 38:46.652
CASTRO:
We're on our way, Agent Gibbs.

38:46.695 --> 38:49.086
Thank you all...
for everything.

38:49.130 --> 38:51.086
ZIVA:
Headed to the airfield.

38:51.130 --> 38:52.391
We will be in touch.

38:52.434 --> 38:55.043
Copy that.

39:02.043 --> 39:04.521
[Lisson speaking Spanish]

39:12.478 --> 39:15.086
Uh... the plane is waiting.

39:15.130 --> 39:16.956
I'd like to be on it

39:17.000 --> 39:18.521
before the Colombian
government changes its mind.

39:18.565 --> 39:19.869
He's right. You have to go.

39:19.913 --> 39:21.434
You should come with us.

39:23.739 --> 39:27.000
Yo no pudiera
ser esto sin ella.

39:27.043 --> 39:28.956
Es una mujer increible.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.391
Antonio Banderas.

39:31.434 --> 39:33.565
Puss in Boots.Ciao.

39:33.608 --> 39:36.000
He is more than he seems.

39:36.043 --> 39:37.695
You are staying?

39:37.739 --> 39:40.000
What do you think?

39:40.043 --> 39:41.782
We made enemies today, Monique.

39:41.826 --> 39:43.565
I have enemies everywhere I go.

39:43.608 --> 39:45.217
Nothing I can't handle.

39:45.260 --> 39:48.000
You are not going to tell me
what you are involved in?

39:50.130 --> 39:52.260
Will I...

39:52.304 --> 39:54.478
Will I ever see you again?

39:54.521 --> 39:57.652
Don't look for happiness
from others, Ziva.

39:57.695 --> 40:01.391
People make
too many mistakes.

40:01.434 --> 40:03.347
Look to yourself.

40:03.391 --> 40:06.086
That is where
you will find it.

40:25.565 --> 40:27.304
Hey.

40:27.347 --> 40:29.434
You want a beer?

40:29.478 --> 40:30.913
I'm invited in?Well, it's a little nippy

40:30.956 --> 40:32.391
to be drinking one out there.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.086
So... [clears throat]

40:37.130 --> 40:39.260
all is forgiven?

40:39.304 --> 40:42.347
I didn't say that.

40:42.391 --> 40:44.217
[laughs softly]

40:44.260 --> 40:47.739
Look, Gibbs, there are reasons
I do the things I do.

40:47.782 --> 40:50.043
You got another boat drawing?

40:50.086 --> 40:52.086
Oh, shut up.

40:53.739 --> 40:56.956
I was hoping to talk to her.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.043
She was helpful.
Yeah.

40:59.086 --> 41:01.043
Lisson has information
that I need.

41:01.086 --> 41:03.652
Over the years, working
both sides of the fence,

41:03.695 --> 41:05.478
she's screwed me
a few times.

41:05.521 --> 41:07.086
We need to talk.

41:09.652 --> 41:12.739
She stayed.

41:12.782 --> 41:15.043
Yeah, I know.

41:15.086 --> 41:19.130
You knew she was involved
from day one.

41:19.173 --> 41:21.478
Can I have that beer?

41:28.217 --> 41:31.000
You staying?

41:32.130 --> 41:34.565
I can't.
I don't have a sitter.

41:35.608 --> 41:38.043
It doesn't have to be overnight.

41:38.086 --> 41:40.130
Gibbs, I'll take what I can get.
