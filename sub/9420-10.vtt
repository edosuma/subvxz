on the phone?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.448
>> Only a handful of times.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.383
>> But you've heard her voice.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.350
>> I have.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.251
I'm just kind of content with

06:26.253 --> 06:27.219
texting.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.186
We talk, literally, from when we

06:28.188 --> 06:30.222
wake up to when we go to sleep,

06:30.224 --> 06:31.089
and it's throughout

06:31.091 --> 06:32.224
the entire day.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.392
>> I let it go and let it go

06:33.394 --> 06:35.994
until that's all he was doing.

06:35.996 --> 06:36.928
>> We were always there for each

06:36.930 --> 06:38.029
other.

06:38.031 --> 06:38.964
We were both going through

06:38.966 --> 06:40.198
hard times.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.366
>> What was going on?

06:41.368 --> 06:42.267
>> I was going through

06:42.269 --> 06:43.301
depression.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.303
Wrestling wasn't panning out

06:45.305 --> 06:46.938
like I thought.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.306
>> He failed a class,

06:48.308 --> 06:50.609
and he hit the locker.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.711
So he got the boxer's fracture,

06:52.713 --> 06:54.913
and we had to go get surgery

06:54.915 --> 06:55.680
and everything,

06:55.682 --> 06:56.715
so he couldn't wrestle.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.582
>> Oh.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.483
>> I actually only got to

06:58.485 --> 07:01.186
wrestle four matches.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.722
I devoted my life to wrestling,

07:03.724 --> 07:04.790
and I just broke down

07:04.792 --> 07:05.991
because of that.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.927
Lost interest in school.

07:08.929 --> 07:09.828
Just didn't care about anything

07:09.830 --> 07:11.062
anymore.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.864
At a point, I thought about

10:06.106 --> 10:07.005
is his future,

10:08.075 --> 10:10.275
this relationship out now,

10:34.034 --> 10:36.434
His mom's concerned about him.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.736
He's about to be a high school

10:37.738 --> 10:38.536
graduate.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.271
And right now, he's totally

10:40.273 --> 10:41.239
wrapped up in this girl.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.341
>> So he can't take a step

10:43.343 --> 10:45.877
forward in his life until we

10:45.879 --> 10:47.012
figure out this mystery.

10:47.014 --> 10:47.912
>> We got an email from Steve,

13:15.128 --> 13:16.294
Yeah, text it to us.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.195
This has been really, really

13:17.197 --> 13:19.564
helpful, so thank you.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.698
All right, later, man.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.233
>> She shared a phone.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.368
>> Well, hold on a second.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.202
>> This is the big news.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.436
>> This could be the big--

13:25.438 --> 13:26.871
>> This is the--She shared a

13:26.873 --> 13:28.039
phone with a girl, Jasmine.

13:28.041 --> 13:28.873
>> Missing piece.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.108
>> And maybe Steve has been

13:30.110 --> 13:32.043
talking to Jasmine.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.011
>> Oh, look, bam.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.312
There are some more tweets.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.814
"That moment you get a message

13:35.816 --> 13:36.881
that seems hella cute,

13:36.883 --> 13:39.017
but you check and it's really to

13:39.019 --> 13:39.951
your best friend..."

13:39.953 --> 13:41.052
>> both: "That account

13:41.054 --> 13:41.719
is linked."

13:41.721 --> 13:43.354
>> Hold on a second.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.523
You can actually share a Twitter

13:45.525 --> 13:46.758
account with someone.

13:46.760 --> 13:50.061
Samm could have been signed in

13:50.063 --> 13:51.830
to her friend's account.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.665
Jasmine thought she got

13:53.667 --> 13:54.999
a really cute message,

13:55.001 --> 13:57.101
but it wasn't actually for her.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.870
It was a message for her friend

13:58.872 --> 13:59.771
Samm.

13:59.773 --> 14:00.672
>> Let's look at Jasmine's

14:00.674 --> 14:01.840
Twitter.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.775
>> Here is Jasmine.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.176
>> "Don't judge what I look like

14:05.178 --> 14:05.844
today.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.278
I look foul today.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.980
I feel I'm almost hitting

14:08.982 --> 14:11.282
the bottom, and it effing sucks.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.518
>> She does have some self-image

14:13.520 --> 14:14.185
issues.

14:14.187 --> 14:14.953
>> "I woke up this morning.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.054
I'd rather be home and cry

14:16.056 --> 14:17.288
than be at school and feeling

14:17.290 --> 14:18.223
tears down my face."

14:18.225 --> 14:19.190
>> She's going through

14:19.192 --> 14:19.891
some stuff.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.025
>> She sounds a lot more like

14:21.027 --> 14:21.693
the sad...

14:21.695 --> 14:23.127
>> Right.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.996
>> Twitter personality

14:24.998 --> 14:26.331
that Steve originally reached

14:26.333 --> 14:26.998
out to.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.166
>> Right, yeah.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.701
>> Jasmine, she's, like, really

14:29.703 --> 14:30.468
struggling with something.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.403
>> "It's a serious struggle to

14:32.405 --> 14:33.404
sleep at night."

14:33.406 --> 14:34.305
>> That's what happens when

14:34.307 --> 14:35.907
you're living with a lie.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.442
>> Theory one...

14:37.444 --> 14:38.109
>> Okay.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.512
>> Samm is Samm but...

14:41.514 --> 14:42.180
>> Right.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.281
>> Doesn't want to video chat

14:43.283 --> 14:44.549
and doesn't want to get too

14:44.551 --> 14:46.150
close to Steve at least,

14:46.152 --> 14:47.285
like, visually.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.821
Theory two, Steve actually has

14:49.823 --> 14:51.155
been talking to Jasmine

14:51.157 --> 14:52.023
this whole time.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.524
>> But before we go any further,

14:53.526 --> 14:54.359
we need to talk to Steve

14:54.361 --> 14:55.994
'cause he might have

14:55.996 --> 14:57.061
a key piece of information

14:57.063 --> 14:58.096
that might unlock

14:58.098 --> 14:59.097
this whole mystery.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.231
>> The cut-and-dried case is

15:00.233 --> 15:03.034
no longer so cut and dry.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.436
It's complicated.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.809
>> Mom can slide in.

15:11.811 --> 15:14.045
We can sit.

15:14.047 --> 15:14.946
So we've got some interesting

15:14.948 --> 15:16.347
things that we found.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.548
We've got some questions that

15:17.550 --> 15:19.017
we're trying to answer.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.119
Hopefully some of this

15:21.121 --> 15:22.153
will make sense,

15:22.155 --> 15:25.023
and maybe you can be the key

15:25.025 --> 15:26.791
to unlock this mystery.

15:26.793 --> 15:27.625
>> Okay.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.893
>> I'm nervous.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.128
>> The first thing we did

15:30.130 --> 15:30.828
was we went through

15:30.830 --> 15:31.996
her Twitter page, okay?

15:31.998 --> 15:33.598
>> That's where he met her.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.599
>> It seems like a real page...

15:34.601 --> 15:35.366
>> Right.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.434
>> Posted by a real girl.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.368
>> From what we can tell.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.369
The next thing we did

15:38.371 --> 15:40.138
was just searched Samm,

15:40.140 --> 15:42.440
and right away,

15:42.442 --> 15:43.641
the first thing that came up

15:43.643 --> 15:45.877
was a YouTube channel.

15:45.879 --> 15:48.146
All of her fights are up here.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.314
It's hard to see her face.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.715
There's no, like, perfect,

15:50.717 --> 15:53.017
crystal clear moment.

15:53.019 --> 15:53.718
>> Where is she?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.421
>> She's in the black, I think.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.356
That seems to indicate she's

15:58.358 --> 15:59.824
been telling you the truth.

15:59.826 --> 16:00.858
Do you think you would want to

16:00.860 --> 16:01.826
wrestle her?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.428
>> Yeah, that would be crazy.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.662
>> This girl could take you.

16:04.664 --> 16:05.697
>> [laughs]

16:05.699 --> 16:07.565
>> What are the chances that you

16:07.567 --> 16:09.067
found--I don't know, maybe there

16:09.069 --> 16:09.834
are a lot of beautiful girls

16:09.836 --> 16:10.401
that wrestle.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.069
>> Right.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.804
>> Right? That's what I think.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.339
>> No, I mean, it's a find.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.207
>> It's very rare

16:16.209 --> 16:17.275
that we get this far

16:17.277 --> 16:19.010
into an investigation

16:19.012 --> 16:21.346
and have all signs point to

16:21.348 --> 16:22.513
the story checking out

16:22.515 --> 16:23.715
and the girl being the girl

16:23.717 --> 16:24.682
in the pictures.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.050
>> I'm just happy, you know?

16:26.052 --> 16:27.952
Everything checks out, so this

16:27.954 --> 16:28.987
seems like good news.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.755
>> But there's still a little

16:30.757 --> 16:31.456
bit more to talk about.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.357
>> There's still a little a fly

16:32.359 --> 16:32.924
in the soup.

16:32.926 --> 16:33.891
>> Okay.

16:33.893 --> 16:34.692
>> I knew it.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.760
>> One thing that we thought was

16:35.762 --> 16:36.894
interesting was this tweet,

16:36.896 --> 16:38.496
which is back from July.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.864
"That moment you get a message

16:39.866 --> 16:41.165
that seems hella cute

16:41.167 --> 16:43.401
but you check and it's really to

16:43.403 --> 16:44.769
your best friend..."

16:44.771 --> 16:45.503
>> both: "That account

16:45.505 --> 16:46.704
is linked."

16:46.706 --> 16:47.805
>> What does it mean?

16:47.807 --> 16:48.840
I don't--

16:48.842 --> 16:49.841
>> Good question.

16:49.843 --> 16:50.842
When was it that you guys

16:50.844 --> 16:51.676
started talking?

16:51.678 --> 16:52.910
>> Around that time.

16:52.912 --> 16:53.911
>> This was the first thing that

16:53.913 --> 16:57.181
got our antennas perky.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.150
So here's this guy, Erick.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.485
We sent him a quick message.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.452
He called us.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.453
He knows Samm.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.055
She's Samm.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.189
She wrestles.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.723
Totally checks out.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.559
The only thing is, he said

17:08.560 --> 17:10.962
"I remember at one point

17:10.964 --> 17:13.498
Samm was sharing her phone

17:13.500 --> 17:15.733
with her best friend, Jasmine."

17:15.734 --> 17:17.268
Do you know about Jasmine?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.236
Is that a person in Samm's life?

17:18.238 --> 17:19.237
>> Never heard--

17:19.239 --> 17:20.204
>> She never talked about

17:20.205 --> 17:21.372
someone named Jasmine?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.674
>> No.

17:23.675 --> 17:26.743
>> Maybe Jasmine was using

17:26.746 --> 17:28.112
the phone and went on Twitter

17:28.114 --> 17:29.080
and saw a message and was like,

17:29.082 --> 17:30.014
"Oh, that's so sweet,"

17:30.016 --> 17:30.915
and then realized, oh, I'm

17:30.917 --> 17:32.316
signed in to the wrong account.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.918
Jasmine may have been signed in

17:33.920 --> 17:35.019
to Samm's account,

17:35.021 --> 17:36.621
then given you her number,

17:36.623 --> 17:37.488
which you, of course, thought

17:37.490 --> 17:38.956
was Samm's number.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.291
And then you guys went off

17:40.293 --> 17:41.125
Twitter, and Samm never even

17:41.127 --> 17:41.959
really paid attention

17:41.961 --> 17:44.228
or noticed it.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.463
>> Yeah, that actually does

17:45.465 --> 17:46.464
kind of make sense,

17:46.466 --> 17:47.465
'cause if she doesn't want to

17:47.467 --> 17:49.367
show me her face on video chat--

17:49.369 --> 17:51.469
>> So we went to her Twitter,

17:51.471 --> 17:53.604
and here's Jasmine.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.539
>> You've never seen her before?

17:54.541 --> 17:55.306
>> I've never seen her.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.207
>> You've never seen this girl,

17:56.209 --> 17:56.607
right?

17:56.609 --> 17:57.442
>> You've never seen her in

17:57.444 --> 17:58.142
pictures with Samm?

17:58.144 --> 17:59.010
>> I've never seen that girl

17:59.012 --> 17:59.911
in my life.

17:59.913 --> 18:00.845
>> We see a lot of tweets

18:00.847 --> 18:02.246
from Jasmine,

18:02.248 --> 18:03.548
and she doesn't seem to be

18:03.550 --> 18:05.283
terribly happy

18:05.285 --> 18:08.519
and is a little kind of insecure

18:08.521 --> 18:09.420
about the way she looks,

18:09.422 --> 18:10.855
and she feels ugly.

18:10.857 --> 18:11.823
>> He said she tweeted something

18:11.825 --> 18:12.490
depressing...

18:12.492 --> 18:13.791
>> Right.

18:13.793 --> 18:14.892
>> And that's why he messaged

18:14.894 --> 18:15.960
her.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.962
Maybe Jasmine's the one who

18:17.964 --> 18:19.831
posted that depressing message.

18:19.833 --> 18:20.965
>> When I talk to Samm,

18:20.967 --> 18:22.967
every time she has a problem,

18:22.969 --> 18:25.002
it sounds this depressing.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.105
You know, she--she says stuff

18:27.107 --> 18:28.072
that--she's, like, a mess

18:28.074 --> 18:29.674
right now.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.909
>> Then it starts to seem like

18:31.911 --> 18:33.544
maybe there's a chance

18:33.546 --> 18:35.079
you could actually be talking to

18:35.081 --> 18:37.181
her friend Jasmine that has

18:37.183 --> 18:39.383
very low self-confidence

18:39.385 --> 18:40.818
and doesn't want to show you

18:40.820 --> 18:41.853
who she really is,

18:41.855 --> 18:43.888
A, because...

18:43.890 --> 18:44.722
she's been lying, and, B,

18:44.724 --> 18:45.690
because she doesn't think

18:45.692 --> 18:47.391
you'll find her attractive.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.094
>> That does make sense.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.896
>> How would you feel if that--

18:51.898 --> 18:54.031
that were the case?

18:54.033 --> 18:56.567
>> It kinda hurts.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.903
But if it does turn out to be

18:58.905 --> 19:00.404
this Jasmine girl,

19:00.406 --> 19:01.973
there's still that emotional

19:01.975 --> 19:03.441
connection that we have.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.342
>> I don't know.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.177
That's starting it out as a lie,

19:06.179 --> 19:07.745
because he doesn't even know

19:07.747 --> 19:08.880
her real name.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.148
I don't see how he could look at

19:10.150 --> 19:11.282
her and say,

19:11.284 --> 19:13.451
"Oh, you're the one."

19:13.453 --> 19:14.685
>> If I can just see who

19:14.687 --> 19:16.287
I've actually been talking to,

19:16.289 --> 19:18.189
I'd be a lot happier.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.423
>> Let's send a picture

19:19.425 --> 19:20.091
of the three of us.

19:20.093 --> 19:20.758
>> Okay.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.926
>> And just say, "Hey,

19:21.928 --> 19:22.693
I'm with the guys.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.061
They'd love to talk to you.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.496
If they call, will you answer?"

19:25.498 --> 19:26.364
>> Okay.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.231
>> Okay, how was it?

19:27.233 --> 19:28.499
>> Okay, that's good.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.134

19:30.136 --> 19:31.335
but you're about to get

19:31.337 --> 19:32.870
a phone call from Nev.

19:32.872 --> 19:33.938
Do you think you could answer

19:33.940 --> 19:34.672
a call?

19:34.674 --> 19:35.473
>> Oh, my God.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.374
>> Oh!

19:36.376 --> 19:39.744
>> "Yes, I will answer!"

19:39.746 --> 19:40.945
All I'm gonna try and do is get

19:40.947 --> 19:42.446
her to agree

19:42.448 --> 19:43.648
to let us come and meet her

19:43.650 --> 19:44.982
this weekend.

19:44.984 --> 19:45.983
>> Okay.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.685

19:47.687 --> 19:49.954
I'll be right back.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.456
>> I am scared.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.802
Is this Samm?

20:04.804 --> 20:07.271
Thanks for getting on the phone.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.339
I'm down here in Texas

20:08.341 --> 20:10.374
with Steven, and we're sort of

20:10.376 --> 20:11.042
at this place now

20:11.044 --> 20:12.577
where we realized it was time to

20:12.579 --> 20:13.377
reach out

20:13.379 --> 20:15.146
and start to get your side of

20:15.148 --> 20:17.582
the story and see if

20:17.584 --> 20:18.482
maybe sort of taking it to the

20:18.484 --> 20:19.917
next level is something you

20:19.919 --> 20:22.987
would be interested in doing.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.157
>> Um...

20:34.866 --> 20:36.267
>> Yeah, we could do that

20:36.269 --> 20:39.971
this weekend.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.305
There is something Steven needs

20:41.307 --> 20:42.406
to know.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.241
This would be, obviously,

20:43.243 --> 20:43.908
a great opportunity

20:43.910 --> 20:46.577
to tell him that.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.492
>> I am looking forward to

21:01.494 --> 21:03.227
meeting you.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.997
Okay, bye.

21:05.999 --> 21:06.998
I just got off the phone

21:07.000 --> 21:08.165
with Samm.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.267

21:09.269 --> 21:10.334
>> I don't know.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.235
I didn't question.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.270
I just wanted to have

21:12.272 --> 21:13.371
a nice call.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.473
And there was one

21:15.475 --> 21:18.042
awkward moment.

21:18.044 --> 21:18.943
She's like, "Look, there's

21:18.945 --> 21:19.577
definitely something

21:19.579 --> 21:20.444
I need to tell him

21:20.446 --> 21:21.746
that I haven't told him.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.181
I'd like to do that in person."

21:24.183 --> 21:26.550

>> I do feel hurt about that.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.700
Hey, as long as the other guy's

27:16.702 --> 27:17.368
out of the picture--

27:17.370 --> 27:18.102
>> Yeah.

27:18.104 --> 27:18.802
>> [laughs]

27:18.804 --> 27:19.837
That's the thing about Steven.

27:19.839 --> 27:20.504
>> Right.

27:20.506 --> 27:23.073
>> He's--he's so gung ho

27:23.075 --> 27:24.174
for you, you know?

27:24.176 --> 27:24.942
>> [laughs]

27:24.944 --> 27:26.443
>> He's, like--he'll forgive

27:26.445 --> 27:27.444
anything right now.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.312
>> Aw. Yeah.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.113
>> Right, right now.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.447
>> That's what worries me

27:30.449 --> 27:31.215
because I don't want...

27:31.217 --> 27:31.782
>> [laughs]

27:31.784 --> 27:33.017
>> The whole "playing with his

27:33.019 --> 27:33.784
heart" kind of thing.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.185
>> Yeah, I know.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.153
That's not my intentions,

27:36.155 --> 27:37.187
though.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.188
>> 'Cause I'm happy

27:38.190 --> 27:39.156
if he's happy.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.624
>> It was actually Aurora that

27:40.626 --> 27:42.326
wrote in to the show.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.193
>> Thank you.

27:43.195 --> 27:43.927
>> She was, obviously,

27:43.929 --> 27:45.129
the greatest skeptic.

27:45.131 --> 27:45.996
>> Oh, my gosh.

27:45.998 --> 27:46.730
>> She's looking out

27:46.732 --> 27:48.098
for her kid.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.134
>> Yeah, 'cause if you spent

27:50.136 --> 27:51.935
time texting him, you know how

27:51.937 --> 27:52.870
him and I are, right?

27:52.872 --> 27:53.737
>> Yeah.

27:53.739 --> 27:54.838
>> He's probably told you.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.240
We're really close, so...

27:56.242 --> 27:57.875
>> Yeah, I've heard.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.309
>> It's tough for mothers to see

27:59.311 --> 28:03.213
their--their sons in

28:03.215 --> 28:04.515
love?

28:04.517 --> 28:05.582
>> [laughs]

28:05.584 --> 28:06.650
>> We do have to talk about

28:06.652 --> 28:09.386
our future together.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.522
>> He's been excited,

28:11.524 --> 28:12.389
looking to the future,

28:12.391 --> 28:13.157
and making plans

28:13.159 --> 28:15.092
for you and him.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.060
And he wants to be part of

28:16.062 --> 28:16.894
your plans.

28:16.896 --> 28:17.561
>> Yeah.

28:17.563 --> 28:18.462
>> But he's even been willing to

28:18.464 --> 28:19.863
sort of ignore his own...

28:19.865 --> 28:20.764
>> Yeah.

28:20.766 --> 28:21.432
>> Future plans...

28:21.434 --> 28:22.166
>> Yeah.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.867
>> To come be with you.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.369
>> I mean, I want you to do best

28:25.371 --> 28:26.704
for what's in your future,

28:26.706 --> 28:27.938
me to do best for what--

28:27.940 --> 28:31.442
I mean, yeah, just realistic.

28:31.444 --> 28:32.543
>> Will you give this guy a hug?

28:32.545 --> 28:33.544
He's shaking.

28:33.546 --> 28:34.611
Just help calm him down

28:34.613 --> 28:35.345
a little bit?

28:35.347 --> 28:36.046
>> I am shaking.

28:36.048 --> 28:36.714
>> Are you okay?

28:36.716 --> 28:39.483
>> I'm fine. I'm just happy.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.751
You know, I can't really take

28:40.753 --> 28:41.618
my eyes off of you.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.221
>> Aw.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.389
>> All right, so look, you guys

28:45.391 --> 28:46.690
should hang out, and we'll--

28:46.692 --> 28:47.691
we'll see you in a little bit.

28:47.693 --> 28:48.692
>> All right.

28:48.694 --> 28:49.693
I appreciate it, guys.

28:49.695 --> 28:50.360
>> Yeah.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.261
Did you want to have a second

28:51.263 --> 28:51.929
with Steven?

28:51.931 --> 28:52.763
Do you need to say anything to

28:52.765 --> 28:53.731
him privately?

28:53.733 --> 28:54.631
>> No, I don't. He's good.

28:54.633 --> 28:55.232
>> No? Okay.

28:55.234 --> 28:55.899
He's good.

28:55.901 --> 28:56.567
>> I taught him well.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.569
>> All right, you kids have fun.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.971
>> All right.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.372
>> I don't know her too well,

29:02.374 --> 29:04.341
but from what I get, she's real

29:04.343 --> 29:05.943
cool, calm, and collected.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.711
>> She's--she's cool.

29:07.713 --> 29:08.779
>> But she has a poker face

29:08.781 --> 29:09.913
right now.

29:09.915 --> 29:10.581
>> Yeah, yeah.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.149
She does have a poker face.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.550
She's a little standoffish

29:13.552 --> 29:15.619
right now.

29:17.555 --> 29:19.723
>> No, don't.

29:19.725 --> 29:20.791
>> I like your shoes, though.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.726
I didn't--I see other people

29:22.728 --> 29:24.061
wearing 'em, but--

29:24.063 --> 29:26.897
>> [laughs]

29:26.899 --> 29:28.532
>> It's so unreal.

29:28.534 --> 29:29.566
>> Mm.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.568
>> Yesterday I was in Texas.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.638
Now I'm sitting next to you.

29:37.575 --> 29:40.978
I actually got to talk to

29:40.980 --> 29:42.813
this girl face-to-face

29:42.815 --> 29:44.314
that I have been talking to

29:44.316 --> 29:45.816
through texts for the past

29:45.818 --> 29:47.184
seven, eight months.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.119
And I can't stop talking,

29:49.121 --> 29:50.254
I can't stop thinking about her.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.890
Like, it's--it's just so much

29:52.892 --> 29:54.091
more amazing than I could have

29:54.093 --> 29:56.059
ever imagined.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.561
And she was so much beautiful--

29:57.563 --> 29:59.029
more beautiful than I thought

29:59.031 --> 30:00.097
she was.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.900
I want to say I--

30:02.902 --> 30:03.934
[exhales sharply]

30:03.936 --> 30:05.736
All right, I'm just gonna

30:05.738 --> 30:06.804
calm down.

30:09.908 --> 30:13.710
>> Gotta check in with Steve,

30:13.712 --> 30:15.445
see how everything went

30:15.447 --> 30:16.513
yesterday.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.248
Think they got to first base?

30:18.250 --> 30:19.483
>> Well, it would be a wrestling

30:19.485 --> 30:20.150
term.

30:20.152 --> 30:20.984
>> Did he pin her?

30:20.986 --> 30:21.785
>> Did he pin her?

30:21.787 --> 30:22.452
>> Right.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.520
>> She probably pinned him.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.222
>> Let's see how it went.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.991
[knocking on door]

30:27.993 --> 30:28.659
>> Hey, guys.

30:28.661 --> 30:29.593
>> Yo.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.394
Oh, he's got a girl over.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.161
We should go. We should go.

30:31.163 --> 30:31.628
>> Whoa.

30:31.630 --> 30:32.596
>> He's got a girl over.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.463
>> She's on the bed.

30:33.465 --> 30:34.298
>> Hey, Mom.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.032
>> Hi.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.700
>> So how did it go?

30:36.702 --> 30:38.368
>> Yeah, give us the scoop.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.370
>> We just sat there, talked.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.338
I felt pretty comfortable

30:41.340 --> 30:42.339
around her.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.207
I felt like I've known her

30:43.209 --> 30:45.175
for a lot longer than a day.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.311
There is that feeling of...

30:47.313 --> 30:49.079
[sighs]

30:49.081 --> 30:50.113
She lied to me, you know.

30:50.115 --> 30:51.248
She's--she was talking to some

30:51.250 --> 30:52.749
other guys,

30:52.751 --> 30:54.351
which I'm--I'm kind of

30:54.353 --> 30:56.386
just trying to get rid

30:56.388 --> 30:57.988
of those feelings.

30:57.990 --> 30:58.889
I'm just having a lot of

30:58.891 --> 31:00.157
conflicting emotions right now.

31:00.159 --> 31:01.458
>> Welcome to adulthood.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.526
>> Yeah.

31:02.528 --> 31:03.961
[laughter]

31:03.963 --> 31:04.928
You know, there's definitely

31:04.930 --> 31:06.196
something I'm gonna have to

31:06.198 --> 31:08.265
deal with and talk to her about.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.867
>> I just have to say

31:09.869 --> 31:11.869
his actions will speak louder

31:11.871 --> 31:13.570
than his words, you know?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.138
>> She wanted to hang out with

31:15.140 --> 31:17.474
me at the Superior Ice Cream

31:17.476 --> 31:18.508
shop.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.343
>> Okay.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.144
Mom, I think yesterday it was

31:21.146 --> 31:21.979
great that you were there.

31:21.981 --> 31:22.880
>> Mm-hmm.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.248
>> But today, I'm not sure they

31:24.250 --> 31:25.082
need, you know, a chaperone.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.483
>> No, they don't.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.384
>> So maybe you'll sit this one

31:27.386 --> 31:27.985
out...

31:27.987 --> 31:28.652
>> Yeah.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.487
>> And we'll let these young

31:30.489 --> 31:31.154
lovebirds--

31:31.156 --> 31:32.522
>> Eat ice cream.

31:32.524 --> 31:33.190
Bye.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.057
>> Bye, Mom.

31:34.059 --> 31:34.958
>> Bye, Son.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.628
Have fun.

31:37.630 --> 31:38.629
>> I don't think I'm gonna find

31:38.631 --> 31:40.397
anybody else like this.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.398
So I just want us to be on

31:41.400 --> 31:42.065
the same page.

31:42.067 --> 31:42.733
>> Right.

31:42.735 --> 31:43.800
What's important is that you

31:43.802 --> 31:46.069
tell her exactly how you feel.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.404
You don't have to sweep anything

31:47.406 --> 31:48.405
under the rug.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.706
If you feel mixed up, I think

31:49.708 --> 31:50.974
it's fair to tell her that you

31:50.976 --> 31:51.975
feel mixed up.

31:51.977 --> 31:52.643
Hello.

31:52.645 --> 31:53.310
>> Hello.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.646
>> Hey, Samm.

31:55.648 --> 31:56.313
>> Hi.

31:56.315 --> 31:56.980
>> How are you?

31:56.982 --> 31:57.648
>> Good.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.250
>> That's good.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.518
>> Why don't you guys hang out?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.419
See you in a little bit.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.488
>> All right.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.659
I like your outfit.

32:08.661 --> 32:12.496
>> Thank you.

32:12.498 --> 32:15.165
>> So this whole time,

32:15.167 --> 32:17.367
you were talking to other guys

32:17.369 --> 32:18.468
while you were talking to me.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.504
>> I mean, yeah,

32:20.506 --> 32:23.473
talking to other guys,

32:23.475 --> 32:24.341
and, you know,

32:24.343 --> 32:26.043
that's basically it.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.511
>> I'd ask you,

32:27.513 --> 32:28.545
"Am I the only one?"

32:28.547 --> 32:31.014
You lied to me and said you

32:31.016 --> 32:32.282
weren't talking to anyone else

32:32.284 --> 32:35.152
and I was the only one.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.220
>> That was bad on my part,

32:37.222 --> 32:39.323
but I just thought I was doing

32:39.325 --> 32:42.125
what was the smartest thing to

32:42.127 --> 32:44.628
stay away from hurting you,

32:44.630 --> 32:45.862
I guess.

32:45.864 --> 32:46.630
I don't know.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.597
There's just not really

32:47.599 --> 32:51.168
an explanation for lying at all.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.669
You were always so sweet to me,

32:52.671 --> 32:53.670
and, like, I know you're

32:53.672 --> 32:54.671
a really good guy,

32:54.673 --> 32:55.572
and that's honest.

32:55.574 --> 32:56.773
That's honest.

32:56.775 --> 32:57.674
Like, you're one of the best

32:57.676 --> 32:59.009
guys, like, I've ever met

32:59.011 --> 33:00.110
in my life.

33:00.112 --> 33:03.180
And that's all true.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.681
>> What about the future?

33:04.683 --> 33:05.916
Do you--do you think you could

33:05.918 --> 33:08.986
see a future with us together?

33:13.257 --> 33:16.393
>> Over texting, I felt like

33:16.395 --> 33:18.228
we were heading, like, towards

33:18.230 --> 33:22.599
a relationship maybe.

33:22.601 --> 33:23.834
So now I just feel like

33:23.836 --> 33:25.168
the connection is kind of

33:25.170 --> 33:26.370
different.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.305
In a way, I still feel like the

33:28.307 --> 33:29.506
connection, like, we've always

33:29.508 --> 33:31.041
had as friends and stuff

33:31.043 --> 33:33.076
and we can talk all day

33:33.078 --> 33:34.945
and we can do whatever.

33:34.947 --> 33:37.314
It's just that--

33:37.316 --> 33:38.648
just the friend connection I

33:38.650 --> 33:43.053
feel in person really.

33:43.055 --> 33:43.987
>> So you don't have feelings
