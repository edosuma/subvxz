25:37.620 --> 25:39.253
- You sure about that?

25:39.388 --> 25:41.889
- Yeah, I am.

25:42.024 --> 25:43.624
- Suit yourself, but you know,

25:43.759 --> 25:45.459
you always like to find out
the hard way, right?

25:45.595 --> 25:48.262
- Mm, the hard way.

25:48.397 --> 25:50.831
Just the way I like it.

25:58.441 --> 26:00.174
- [door closes]

26:19.295 --> 26:21.195
- [door opens]

26:23.532 --> 26:25.366
- Hey.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.135
- Hey, man.

26:28.271 --> 26:29.770
- Rough night?

26:29.905 --> 26:33.340
- No, no, no, uh,
just movin' slow.

26:33.643 --> 26:36.176
- Oh, okay.

26:36.312 --> 26:37.478
I have instructions
to escort you

26:37.613 --> 26:40.147
up to the residence.

26:40.283 --> 26:41.482
- Wait, what?

26:41.617 --> 26:43.984
- The first lady
would like to see you.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.788
- Wait, wait, what?
- Yeah, come on.

26:47.923 --> 26:49.823
- All right, you know,
let me um, I'ma run my bag

26:49.959 --> 26:51.859
over to the office quick,
all right?

26:51.994 --> 26:56.664
- No, she wants to see you now.

26:58.301 --> 27:00.467
- Okay.

27:00.603 --> 27:04.071
- Okay, come on.

27:23.859 --> 27:27.194
- Bobby?
- Yeah.

27:29.165 --> 27:30.931
- I'm gonna go to my studio.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.666
- Okay.
- So, if you need anything...

27:32.802 --> 27:36.036
- I'm good, thank you.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.772
- And you're gonna stay here,
right?

27:38.908 --> 27:43.143
- Yes, if he leaves,
I need to know who's on him.

27:43.279 --> 27:44.511
- What do you mean?

27:44.647 --> 27:47.047
- Some guys are just
not as good as others, Lilly.

27:47.183 --> 27:48.282
- Okay.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.751
So, you're gonna stay here,
right?

27:50.886 --> 27:54.154
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:56.525 --> 27:59.460
- I heard him.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.996
- What?
- In the dining room.

28:03.132 --> 28:05.332
I heard him.
- You did?

28:05.468 --> 28:08.001
- Well, you believe him?

28:08.137 --> 28:12.706
- Bobby.
- Do you? Just tell me.

28:12.842 --> 28:16.143
- You know, I really don't know
what to believe right now.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.479
- He's playin' mind games
with you Lilly.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.781
- Well, I hope so.

28:20.916 --> 28:24.818
- I don't know how else
to get you to believe me.

28:25.721 --> 28:27.521
- Well, I want to.

28:27.656 --> 28:29.256
- Time will tell.

28:31.694 --> 28:34.728
- Yeah, you're right.

28:36.932 --> 28:41.835
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

28:41.971 --> 28:45.072
- I wanna make love to you.

28:46.409 --> 28:48.609
- Bobby.

28:48.744 --> 28:51.912
- Can you be a little late?

28:53.816 --> 28:57.317
- I got five minutes.

28:57.853 --> 29:00.187
- You can.

29:01.590 --> 29:05.993
- Bobby.
- Come here.

29:06.128 --> 29:07.461
- I don't think
this is the best thing

29:07.596 --> 29:09.129
to be doin' right now.

29:09.265 --> 29:11.432
- Yeah, it is.

29:15.037 --> 29:18.205
- [Lilly and Bobby moaning]

29:20.676 --> 29:22.209
- Lilly.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.652
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

29:31.787 --> 29:32.653
- How are you today?

29:32.788 --> 29:34.922
- I'm really good.

29:35.057 --> 29:38.225
I had some ribs earlier.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.726
- That's good.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.663
- Speaking of ribs.

29:43.632 --> 29:47.534
I see you brought my friend.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:47.670 --> 29:49.837
- Thank you.

29:49.972 --> 29:52.072
- Ma'am, should I wait?

29:52.208 --> 29:54.174
- No, no,
that won't be necessary.

29:54.310 --> 29:58.145
We, we shouldn't be long.
- Okay.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.423
- How are you?

30:09.558 --> 30:12.125
- Oh, I'm fine, ma'am.

30:12.261 --> 30:14.261
- Did you sleep well?

30:14.396 --> 30:18.432
- You know, I can't say
that I did sleep well.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.567
- Come on, Allan.

30:20.703 --> 30:23.804
You're a man, you can't take
a little ass-whoopin'?

30:23.939 --> 30:26.607
- Ma'am.
- Cut the ma'am shit.

30:29.245 --> 30:31.178
Did you do
what I asked you to do?

30:31.313 --> 30:35.682
- No, I did not.
- Ooh, that's too bad.

30:35.818 --> 30:38.418
Why didn't you?
- She didn't come home, ma'am.

30:38.554 --> 30:41.722
- Hmm,
are you lying to me Allan?

30:41.857 --> 30:45.692
- I'm not lying to you, okay?
I'm telling you the truth.

30:45.828 --> 30:47.861
- Okay, then where was she?

30:47.997 --> 30:49.863
- I don't know, she's mad at me.

30:49.999 --> 30:51.498
Um, I wish I could tell you

30:51.634 --> 30:53.467
but she's not
telling me anything.

30:53.602 --> 30:58.138
- So, you're a weak-ass man
who can't control a girl.

30:58.841 --> 31:00.841
- I'm sorry.

31:00.976 --> 31:03.277
- Yeah, well,
he'll be back tonight.

31:03.412 --> 31:05.279
- No please.
- And every night,

31:05.414 --> 31:07.781
until you do
what I told you to do.

31:07.917 --> 31:09.216
- I'm begging you, okay, please.

31:09.351 --> 31:12.553
I-I-I don't know why
you're doing this to me.

31:12.688 --> 31:14.688
- To you?
- To me.

31:14.823 --> 31:16.523
- [Victoria laughs]

31:16.659 --> 31:19.293
- Honey, I am helping you.

31:19.428 --> 31:22.162
- You're helping me?
How are you helping me?

31:22.298 --> 31:24.531
- She is -- my husband.

31:24.667 --> 31:27.668
And I'm not breaking
another nail on that bitch.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.970
You handle it.

31:30.105 --> 31:32.172
- Ma'am.
- Or,

31:32.308 --> 31:35.409
have your ass beat
every night until you do.

31:35.544 --> 31:40.981
- Okay, look, this is wrong.
- How so?

31:41.116 --> 31:44.585
- How so?
You're the first lady.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.521
Y-you can't be condoning
domestic violence.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.357
- No, I don't.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.893
In public.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.430
- Okay, well,
what do you call this?

31:56.565 --> 31:58.599
- In private.

31:58.734 --> 32:02.402
It's you doing
what I asked you to do.

32:02.538 --> 32:03.570
- Yeah, yep, yep.

32:03.706 --> 32:05.038
I know what
you're askin' me to do.

32:05.174 --> 32:08.542
And it's me,
a man, beating a woman.

32:08.677 --> 32:12.546
- Who is a slut
that needs her ass beat.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.314
- Okay, look.

32:14.450 --> 32:16.283
I see there is
no talking to you.

32:16.418 --> 32:17.951
- Are you getting smart with me?

32:18.087 --> 32:19.953
- Please just hear me out, okay?

32:20.089 --> 32:22.990
I'm sorry, I can't do it,
I can't hit Ellie.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.658
I won't do it.

32:26.996 --> 32:30.464
- Well, then you better invest
in some boxing gloves.

32:30.599 --> 32:34.968
- Look, ma'am,
if you send that man

32:35.104 --> 32:37.070
back to my house,
I swear to God,

32:37.206 --> 32:38.972
I'm gonna kill him.

32:39.108 --> 32:41.975
- Look at you
being all hard and shit.

32:42.111 --> 32:43.877
That's cute.

32:44.013 --> 32:46.213
- I'm tellin' you now.

32:46.348 --> 32:50.317
- Okay, you love her that much.

32:50.452 --> 32:53.120
- Yeah, I do.
And I love me that much.

32:53.255 --> 32:54.921
I'm not gonna do it, okay?

32:55.057 --> 32:58.325
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you, please.

32:59.762 --> 33:02.562
- Okay, okay, fine.

33:04.133 --> 33:07.434
- Fine, I should get going.

33:08.237 --> 33:11.571
- I haven't dismissed you.

33:12.941 --> 33:15.776
- Can I go now?

33:15.911 --> 33:17.778
- You may go.

33:19.114 --> 33:22.516
- Thanks. Thanks.

33:23.352 --> 33:26.019
- Have a good day.

33:26.155 --> 33:28.255
[giggles]

33:38.167 --> 33:41.068
- Where the hell is he?

33:41.203 --> 33:42.135
- Good morning, Donald.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.771
- Good morning, sir.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.474
- You see the news this morning?

33:47.609 --> 33:49.209
- Yes sir, I did.

33:49.344 --> 33:52.779
- All those well wishes
and concern for me.

33:52.915 --> 33:55.415
- Yes, sir.

33:55.551 --> 33:58.051
- I think the people
really do love me, Donald.

33:58.187 --> 33:59.653
- Yes, sir.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.254
- If they only knew.

34:02.357 --> 34:04.291
- Knew what, sir?

34:05.461 --> 34:07.327
- I don't give a shit.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.767
- You don't care, sir?

34:13.902 --> 34:18.305
- No, but do you know
what I do care about, Donald?

34:18.440 --> 34:19.940
- What's that, sir?

34:20.075 --> 34:22.876
- Do you know what I did not see
on the news last night?

34:23.011 --> 34:24.478
- What is that, sir?

34:24.613 --> 34:27.414
- I did not see the announcement

34:27.549 --> 34:30.851
that Victoria's father was dead.

34:32.254 --> 34:33.720
- Well, sir, it's,

34:33.856 --> 34:36.223
it's a little complicated.
- I told you to do that.

34:36.358 --> 34:37.657
- I don't think
we can do that, sir.

34:37.793 --> 34:39.126
- Why not?

34:39.261 --> 34:43.663
- Because I don't think
that it's wise.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.133
- Donald.
- Yes?

34:46.268 --> 34:48.168
- He's 80 years old.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.437
He's gonna die anyway.

34:50.572 --> 34:53.440
- Exactly sir, which is why
I just think it's wise

34:53.575 --> 34:55.776
that we wait it out, hmm?

34:55.911 --> 34:57.110
- What are we waiting for?

34:57.246 --> 34:58.979
For him to take
another shot at me?

34:59.114 --> 35:02.482
- Sir, I just wanna make sure
that the man that we're after

35:02.618 --> 35:05.619
was actually sent
by your father-in-law, hm?

35:05.754 --> 35:08.755
- Donald, I told you
to do it last night.

35:08.891 --> 35:11.391
- And I didn't.

35:11.527 --> 35:13.160
- Tell me why that is, Donald.

35:13.295 --> 35:15.162
- I wanted to wait
for you to calm down.

35:15.297 --> 35:16.997
So that you could
rethink this, sir.

35:17.132 --> 35:19.733
Because he is, mm.

35:20.502 --> 35:23.970
Sir, he is a very powerful man.
When he is gone,

35:24.106 --> 35:28.308
hear me out, you won't have any
protection in this White House.

35:33.715 --> 35:35.849
- So, Victoria got to you too.

35:35.984 --> 35:37.684
- No, no sir, she didn't.

35:37.820 --> 35:40.520
But you know what? She's right.

35:40.656 --> 35:42.455
- Y-you know what?

35:42.591 --> 35:44.191
That son of a bitch
tried to kill

35:44.326 --> 35:45.559
the President
of the United States

35:45.694 --> 35:47.227
and nobody seems to care.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.429
- N-now sir, that's not true.

35:49.565 --> 35:50.931
- Where's the gunman?

35:51.066 --> 35:54.167
- We thought we had him, sir,
but he got away.

35:54.303 --> 35:56.136
- He got away?
- Sir.

35:56.271 --> 35:57.504
- Donald, what is this bullshit?

35:57.639 --> 35:59.673
- It is fine, trust me.
Okay?

35:59.808 --> 36:00.774
- It is not fine.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.809
I-I want him hunted down,
right now.

36:02.945 --> 36:04.377
- Sir, as soon as
we have him captured,

36:04.513 --> 36:07.080
trust me, he is all yours.

36:07.216 --> 36:08.682
- Yeah, he is all mine.

36:08.817 --> 36:10.617
And you know
what's gonna happen?

36:10.752 --> 36:12.452
I'm gonna question him,

36:12.588 --> 36:14.821
and I'm gonna get him
to tell me who hired him.

36:14.957 --> 36:18.325
And it's gonna
be Victoria's father and then,

36:18.460 --> 36:20.393
then, maybe you'll let me
kill him.

36:20.529 --> 36:22.562
- Well sir, let's just be sure
that the guy that we're after

36:22.698 --> 36:25.232
was actually sent by her father.
How about that?

36:25.367 --> 36:27.868
- Donald, who else would it be?

36:28.003 --> 36:28.969
- I'm not sure, sir.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.872
But I will definitely
find out for you.

36:32.007 --> 36:33.139
- You have one hour.

36:33.275 --> 36:37.110
- Sir, it's gonna take
a lot longer than that.

36:37.246 --> 36:39.012
- Then what good are you?

36:39.147 --> 36:41.681
- I'm sorry?

36:43.218 --> 36:46.286
- One hour, Donald.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.255
- Yes, sir.

36:48.390 --> 36:51.024
- And tell Ellie to come see me.

36:51.159 --> 36:54.060
- Oh, she's not in yet, sir.

36:55.898 --> 36:57.030
- Where is she?

36:57.165 --> 36:58.865
- She's home, resting.

36:59.001 --> 37:03.203
Yeah, she should be in
around noon, hm?

37:03.338 --> 37:05.472
- Great, when she comes in

37:05.607 --> 37:07.107
send her straight here.

37:07.242 --> 37:08.575
- Yes, sir.

37:09.645 --> 37:11.878
- That'll be all Donald.

37:12.014 --> 37:14.381
- Yes, sir.

37:23.325 --> 37:25.525
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:26.094 --> 37:27.928
- Look,
wanna grab some lunch later?

37:28.063 --> 37:30.230
- Yeah, okay.

37:30.365 --> 37:32.632
- All right, cool.

37:35.203 --> 37:36.670
- You good?

37:36.805 --> 37:41.041
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.

37:41.777 --> 37:44.811
- You don't look
like you're good.

37:44.947 --> 37:48.248
- Um, well, I uh, I just...

37:48.383 --> 37:50.483
- What is it?

37:51.653 --> 37:54.020
- Look, I need a favor.
