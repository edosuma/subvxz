WEBVTT

00:03.322 --> 00:07.362
Our hatred is concrete.
Our enemy is obvious.

00:08.082 --> 00:11.563
It's Iblis. It is the Christian.

00:12.003 --> 00:14.123
And, as the Koran says:

00:14.443 --> 00:17.923
"I will fill Hell with you all,
you and all those after you."

THE NEW POPE Episode 2

04:04.666 --> 04:06.426
Please, let my mother be cured.

04:08.027 --> 04:10.227
She is all I have in the world.

04:12.307 --> 04:16.627
You know I have always been
so weak and fragile.

04:18.628 --> 04:20.428
Holy Virgin Mary,

04:21.588 --> 04:25.708
I am not capable
of staying in this world alone.

04:27.909 --> 04:29.349
If she dies,

04:31.789 --> 04:33.389
let me die with her.

04:42.150 --> 04:44.790
Good morning!
You're listening to Radio 103.

04:44.870 --> 04:47.871
It's six on the dot,
time for "Questions of the Day",

04:48.711 --> 04:51.472
when we read out the questions
that have been keeping you up at night.

04:52.591 --> 04:55.991
We've selected the ones most asked.
So, here we go.

04:56.391 --> 04:58.872
Number one:
how did Pope Francis II die?

05:04.312 --> 05:07.953
Number two: Does anyone believe
the story of his sudden illness?

05:10.313 --> 05:14.513
Number three: Didn't the same thing
happen to Pope John Paul I?

05:17.554 --> 05:21.114
Number four:
Isn't it true that Pope John Paul I

05:21.274 --> 05:25.114
caused more than a few problems
for the upper echelons at the Vatican?

05:27.875 --> 05:30.315
Number five:
Does history repeat itself?

05:33.275 --> 05:35.595
Number six:
Who will the new pope be?

05:42.596 --> 05:43.756
Come here!

06:00.478 --> 06:01.798
On your knees.

06:06.279 --> 06:07.719
Just don't get me dirty.

06:36.082 --> 06:37.282
I have to change.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.123
I'm off.

06:52.443 --> 06:54.803
Come back with the new pope
in your pocket.

06:55.884 --> 06:59.004
By the way, they say Brannox
is very attractive.

07:00.324 --> 07:03.164
Then I will use all my brazen charm
to persuade him.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.565
Don't get me all excited
once again.

07:06.525 --> 07:09.245
I've got a lot of projects
to propose to Brannox.

07:09.405 --> 07:13.445
You only have one project in life,
Tomas: to give me pleasure.

08:15.892 --> 08:18.612
The New Pope is Dead

08:23.172 --> 08:29.333
Voiello, more than one article
insinuates, between lines, of course,

08:30.053 --> 08:35.414
that you may have had a hand
in Francis II's death.

08:37.453 --> 08:38.974
I can't blame them.

08:39.414 --> 08:43.414
If I were in their shoes,
I would be suspicious of me as well.

08:44.335 --> 08:46.775
- Are you nervous?
- I am always nervous.

08:46.975 --> 08:50.815
- I am not a bland man.
- What makes you nervous?

08:52.095 --> 08:53.975
- Haste.
- I agree.

08:54.536 --> 09:01.016
Haste drove us to make a rather
questionable choice: Francis II.

09:02.176 --> 09:05.257
We have to convince Brannox
to accept

09:05.617 --> 09:09.377
before we return to Rome
for Francis II's funeral.

09:09.497 --> 09:12.057
Why do you need him
to agree in advance?

09:12.337 --> 09:15.058
We can't afford
to vote for him in the conclave

09:15.178 --> 09:17.538
and then, perhaps,
he doesn't accept.

09:18.098 --> 09:19.738
There is a risk.

09:19.818 --> 09:24.499
I am told he is a difficult man
full of doubts and lofty.

09:25.179 --> 09:27.299
I want a new pope
on the first vote.

09:27.939 --> 09:30.779
Sir John is a priest
of the highest caliber.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.740
A true father figure,
wise and well-balanced.

09:35.460 --> 09:40.020
We spent many fruitful days
of serene study together,

09:41.420 --> 09:43.100
during the European Synod.

09:45.421 --> 09:48.661
They say sometimes
he tends toward depression.

09:48.861 --> 09:52.101
Do you know of a priest
who doesn't have this tendency?

09:53.662 --> 09:57.342
At any rate,
it's astounding how many Anglicans

09:57.422 --> 10:00.942
he has converted to Catholicism,
a multitude.

10:02.102 --> 10:07.383
He did not attend the last conclave.
I find this unbecoming.

10:07.903 --> 10:14.264
He wasn't able to attend because he had
to look after his elderly, ill parents.

10:15.384 --> 10:20.584
Speaking of which, he has written me
a very moving letter of 36 pages,

10:21.024 --> 10:23.425
which I would like to share
with all of you.

10:23.865 --> 10:24.945
Please!

10:28.185 --> 10:33.746
What would Pius XIII say?
We have forgotten about Pius XIII.

10:35.586 --> 10:41.586
I have not forgotten him, Gutierrez.
Rather, I am trying to honor him.

10:42.906 --> 10:48.067
Our beloved Lenny began his papacy
animated by intransigence,

10:48.147 --> 10:50.027
but in the end, he softened.

10:50.787 --> 10:52.988
He was searching
for the middle way.

10:53.908 --> 10:56.908
Which is why we are going
to see Sir John Brannox.

10:57.868 --> 11:01.908
He is the great theorist
of the middle way.

11:02.708 --> 11:06.589
First conscience,
then the papal infallibility.

11:06.669 --> 11:10.469
First the softness of compromise,
then the dogma.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.390
This, roughly speaking,
is Sir John's philosophy.

11:16.230 --> 11:21.350
And the only philosophy
that can placate the sex scandals,

11:21.910 --> 11:27.711
the terrorist threats,
the drift toward idolatry of Pius XIII

11:28.271 --> 11:33.152
and the dreadful suspicions
regarding the death of Francis II.

11:34.032 --> 11:37.352
We are under siege,
do you understand that?

11:38.192 --> 11:40.952
Which is why we are at haste.

11:41.792 --> 11:45.393
And which is why we have
only one viable candidate:

11:46.633 --> 11:47.873
Sir John Brannox.

11:55.274 --> 11:58.034
The famous statue
of Cardinal Newman!

11:58.474 --> 12:01.874
I've only heard about that
but I've never seen it before.

12:02.435 --> 12:04.835
- Who's he?
- What do you mean?

12:05.875 --> 12:08.435
Sir John's
philosophical spiritual mentor.

12:25.597 --> 12:26.597
It's him.

12:36.078 --> 12:37.198
It's not him.

12:40.078 --> 12:44.919
We are the Vatican delegation.
His Eminence is expecting us.

12:46.039 --> 12:50.959
As his Eminence always says,
we are all expected, sooner or later.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.680
I told you
he tends toward depression.

12:55.680 --> 12:59.280
His Eminence sends his apologies,
but he was extremely tired

12:59.400 --> 13:02.001
and he never goes to bed
later than ten thirty.

13:03.001 --> 13:05.561
He is looking forward
to see you in the morning.

13:05.641 --> 13:07.281
Allow me to show you
to yours rooms.

13:07.401 --> 13:11.282
It is very important
that we see him right away.

13:12.082 --> 13:15.242
We were planning on leaving early
tomorrow morning.

13:15.442 --> 13:16.642
Imposible.

13:17.522 --> 13:21.483
Sir John never alters his habits,
not even in the face of death.

13:21.763 --> 13:24.283
- Are there ghosts here?
- Yes.

14:51.612 --> 14:53.732
I felt lonely all of a sudden.

15:04.213 --> 15:06.373
But if I l let you come in now,

15:09.573 --> 15:13.174
we'll feel even more lonely later.

15:44.057 --> 15:45.657
You made the right decision.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.217
Pleasure leads to pain.

15:55.418 --> 15:58.978
- What's that music?
- I think it's him, Sir John.

16:00.339 --> 16:04.419
- What's he like? Have you seen him?
- Not yet. He was tired.

16:05.539 --> 16:08.979
- What is it, a harpsichord?
- No, it's a harp.

16:10.060 --> 16:12.620
- You're wrong, it's a harpsichord.
- Enough.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.781
These noblemen
are looking at me.

16:24.701 --> 16:26.021
Lick me.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.561
We will never be apart,
will we, John?

19:40.161 --> 19:41.841
Never, Adam, never!

20:33.886 --> 20:37.167
There you are, Eminence!
I finally found you.

20:38.567 --> 20:45.207
They have been sitting there like that,
without moving an hour and 10 minutes.

20:45.887 --> 20:48.808
What is it,
some sort of embalming process?

20:49.968 --> 20:52.808
No, it's unberarable grief.

20:55.368 --> 20:58.129
Is the one in the tomb their son?

20:59.929 --> 21:02.049
Sir John's twin brother: Adam.

21:05.209 --> 21:08.290
Even after forty years,
the Duke and Duchess

21:08.410 --> 21:12.370
will sit there like that
for another eight hours.

21:13.650 --> 21:18.971
And then, at sunset,
Duchess Brannox will sigh, just once.

21:20.811 --> 21:23.611
And the servants will know
that it is time to go back inside.

21:25.572 --> 21:28.492
And it's time for you
to go inside, as well, Eminence.

21:28.892 --> 21:31.652
- Sir John is waiting for you.
- Finally.

22:16.457 --> 22:18.617
Do you know
where I might find Sir John?

22:21.737 --> 22:23.697
You just have, Eminence.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.340
So, here we are

22:50.060 --> 22:54.140
faced with the frightful task
of having to converse.

22:55.181 --> 22:58.301
Unfortunately they still
have not discovered

22:58.381 --> 23:01.501
any better way
to make someone's acquaintance.

23:01.901 --> 23:05.022
No-sense, of course they have.
What about love at first sight?

23:05.142 --> 23:08.902
Followed by amorous passion,
savage and silent.

23:09.942 --> 23:12.542
That would make me uncomfortable.

23:13.142 --> 23:17.023
So let's stick
with an old-fashioned conversation.

23:19.343 --> 23:22.663
- I am...
- You are the star.

23:23.183 --> 23:28.304
Everyone knows who you are!
His Eminence, Cardinal Angelo Voiello.

23:29.064 --> 23:31.224
Do you know
how many time I have read

23:31.304 --> 23:34.145
your delightful
"Man Behind the Scenes"?

23:34.545 --> 23:36.425
- No, how many?
- Once.

23:37.945 --> 23:41.825
Because I said to myself
if I read this book again

23:41.905 --> 23:45.666
there is a good chance
I will turn decidedly bad.

23:59.787 --> 24:01.547
So how do you find me?

24:03.107 --> 24:07.308
- I would say well, Eminence.
- I am enchafed.

24:08.228 --> 24:11.908
It's only others
who truly know how I am.

24:13.188 --> 24:17.749
I imagine that you can well imagine
the reason for our visit.

24:18.509 --> 24:21.509
I have no imagination, Eminence.

24:22.589 --> 24:26.310
So, in order to lead
an acceptable existence,

24:26.710 --> 24:29.030
I have learnt
to pare down the questions.

24:29.110 --> 24:31.550
Then allow me to inform you.

24:31.910 --> 24:37.951
- Have you already seen my parents?
- I believe I caught a glimpse of them.

24:38.951 --> 24:43.312
You were very fortunate.
It is not easy to intercept them.

24:43.472 --> 24:46.672
They live in the other wing
of the castle, the north wing,

24:46.752 --> 24:50.232
so as to scrupulously avoid
ever having to see me.

24:52.272 --> 24:59.193
- Family dynamics can be wearing.
- Everything can be wearing here.

25:00.273 --> 25:02.954
The weather, the food,
the monotony, London.

25:05.434 --> 25:08.594
Do you know why my parents
never ever wish to see me?

25:09.874 --> 25:10.994
No. Why?

25:11.874 --> 25:14.595
Because they believe
I did not do enough

25:14.675 --> 25:17.035
to save the life
of my twin brother Adam,

25:17.355 --> 25:21.915
their favorite son,
on a cold winter days back in 1985.

25:24.916 --> 25:25.996
I am sorry.

25:28.036 --> 25:30.476
There is little
to be sorry about now.

25:32.196 --> 25:35.197
My parents are only doing
what all humans do:

25:35.837 --> 25:37.997
blaming everything on others.

25:40.517 --> 25:44.598
However, at least we Catholics
blame everything on God.

25:46.118 --> 25:52.278
- Actually we give him all the credit.
- Is that not the same thing?

25:54.199 --> 25:55.279
Tell me...

25:57.719 --> 26:02.600
how much of his life does a Secretary
of State spend informing himself?

26:03.160 --> 26:06.840
All of it.
Even when I pray, I inform myself.

26:10.960 --> 26:15.401
That joke is terribly funny,
even tough I did not laugh.

26:17.361 --> 26:21.641
- How is our beloved Pius XIII?
- Stable.

26:22.722 --> 26:27.362
- But still in coma, unfortunately.
- Pius XIII was a great pope.

26:28.882 --> 26:33.123
I wept when I learnt
his condition was irreversible.

26:35.203 --> 26:36.203
How I wept!

26:41.003 --> 26:42.844
Do you weep, Eminence?

26:46.164 --> 26:47.284
Far too often.

26:47.924 --> 26:51.284
More than one would expect
of the Secretary of State.

26:52.725 --> 26:54.405
And what do you weep for?

26:55.685 --> 26:59.525
For Hollywood romances,
and friends who suffer.

27:01.686 --> 27:04.526
And you?
What do you weep for?

27:04.726 --> 27:08.246
For the inexhaustible
imperfection of the world.

27:13.487 --> 27:17.207
- It must not be easy being you.
- It is not.

27:27.248 --> 27:33.689
I want to make one thing
perfectly clear from the start:

27:35.889 --> 27:37.449
I loved my brother Adam.

27:43.050 --> 27:46.010
Sir John,
when will I see you again?

27:53.291 --> 27:56.251
A question
a lover would ask, Eminence.

28:12.133 --> 28:13.453
Last night, in my room,

28:14.773 --> 28:17.533
I felt the clear presence
of Pius XIII next to me.

28:40.375 --> 28:43.176
What sort of woman
do you think she is?

28:45.616 --> 28:47.416
Pardon my vulgarity Sir,

28:49.136 --> 28:51.417
but she is a beauty.

28:54.657 --> 28:57.697
Why did you not bring me
my box last night?

28:59.297 --> 29:00.738
I did bring it, Sir John.

29:01.978 --> 29:05.378
I left it on your bedside table
in the usual place.

29:06.898 --> 29:08.098
I couldn't find it.

29:10.459 --> 29:13.379
Though I managed
to fall asleep anyway.

29:18.059 --> 29:19.539
Perhaps it's a sign.

29:22.700 --> 29:23.820
Perhaps.

29:35.101 --> 29:36.661
They are coming back early.

29:41.662 --> 29:42.702
Strange!

30:15.105 --> 30:19.225
So, Eminence,
the reason for our visit...

30:20.066 --> 30:24.426
- How did Francis II die actually?
- Heart attack.

30:24.986 --> 30:27.546
- Like John Paul I?
- Exactly.

30:28.466 --> 30:33.467
One of Giambattista Vico's
ever-recurring cycles of human history.

30:34.107 --> 30:38.627
Your brazen tendency to oversimplify
alarms me, Voiello.

30:39.068 --> 30:43.068
I suffered when Great Britain
voted in favor of Brexit.

30:44.948 --> 30:49.069
Another small step toward
the dechristianization of Europe.

30:49.829 --> 30:52.589
You already sound like a pope,
Eminence.

30:53.309 --> 30:56.509
And you like an aspiring
Secretary of State, Eminence.

31:02.030 --> 31:06.630
Do tell, Gutierrez, how is
the weather in Rome, these days?

31:06.710 --> 31:08.831
I haven't been there
since I was young,

31:09.031 --> 31:12.151
when I was a student
at the Gregorian University.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.311
- Constantly mild, Eminence.
- Not here.

31:18.672 --> 31:20.752
Here the weather is a torment.

31:21.712 --> 31:24.472
And life ends up
adapting to the weather.

31:24.712 --> 31:27.752
Rome is different.
Rome is joyful.

31:28.473 --> 31:31.553
And life ends up
adapting itself to Rome.

31:33.713 --> 31:36.993
How large
is your estate Eminence?

31:39.794 --> 31:40.914
I have no idea.

31:42.514 --> 31:46.474
Around 2500 acres or so
would I've thought.

31:47.714 --> 31:50.675
The Vatican is only 108.

31:50.755 --> 31:53.755
It would be so much easier
to manage, Eminence.

31:54.275 --> 31:57.075
Quite frankly,
I am astounded at the method

31:57.595 --> 32:00.556
you chose
to make me such a proposal.

32:00.796 --> 32:04.476
It's as if you are offering me
a position as a CEO.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.476
They're pretending to be unaware

32:06.556 --> 32:10.637
of the enormous spiritual weight
that such a mission requires.

32:12.277 --> 32:16.237
To be pope, Eminence,
is a martyrdom.

32:16.917 --> 32:20.718
And after Pius XIII it's a burden.

32:22.038 --> 32:24.038
And after Francis II

32:26.238 --> 32:27.759
it's suspect.

32:29.559 --> 32:35.559
Thank you for your precious help,
but being pope is not a martyrdom.

32:36.399 --> 32:38.280
It is an enormous privilege.

32:39.120 --> 32:42.600
Eminence, I am astounded
at the results you have obtained.

32:42.720 --> 32:45.440
All those Anglicans
converting to Catholicism?

32:46.160 --> 32:50.281
- How did you do it?
- By talking about other things.

32:51.561 --> 32:56.561
For years, these rooms were a temple
for lighthearted encounters.

32:56.761 --> 32:59.882
People expect priests
to talk about religion.

32:59.962 --> 33:04.042
But I knew that a revealed religion
must be poetic.

33:05.602 --> 33:10.963
So I would speak with them
about golf, Holderlin, Montale

33:11.323 --> 33:13.163
and the Arsenal football club

33:13.483 --> 33:16.203
and the way women
have of crossing their legs.

33:17.924 --> 33:19.004
Poetry!

33:21.484 --> 33:25.324
And they would discover
what it means to be Catholic,

33:26.524 --> 33:30.885
means being everything, for everything
belongs to the grace of God.

33:32.005 --> 33:37.486
I could hear myself talking
and realized that I was playing a part.

33:39.806 --> 33:43.046
Good actors know
that at a certain point

33:44.126 --> 33:46.927
it is time
to withdraw from the stage.

33:49.167 --> 33:54.207
But great actors die on stage.
Because they never stop improving.

33:56.687 --> 33:58.168
And growing, I know.

34:00.328 --> 34:04.888
"Growth is the only evidence of life",
Cardinal Newman used to say.

34:06.288 --> 34:10.248
But the everlasting question is:
do I want to grow?

34:11.049 --> 34:12.728
Do I want to live?

34:26.010 --> 34:28.371
You want me to be the next pope.

34:33.011 --> 34:34.731
The Church is naked,

34:35.451 --> 34:40.652
and you believe the most suitable
outfit in which to cloth her

34:40.891 --> 34:42.532
is my famous middle way.

34:44.452 --> 34:49.853
But since the Church is already naked,
before dressing her again,

34:50.493 --> 34:54.092
you need to examine her,
the way a doctor would.

34:57.014 --> 35:01.374
Diagnosing the Church
is a colossal enterprise, Voiello,

35:01.894 --> 35:03.974
which you underestimate gravely.

35:05.774 --> 35:11.935
It is essential to distinguish
between what is physiological

35:12.855 --> 35:16.856
and what is pathological
in the body of the Church.

35:17.856 --> 35:19.096
There.

35:19.256 --> 35:25.336
His Eminence has just explained to you
the basic principle of the Middle Way.

35:28.177 --> 35:31.937
Will you take the stage again,
Sir John?

35:36.418 --> 35:37.658
I don't know.

35:38.618 --> 35:39.978
I don't know.

35:41.178 --> 35:44.298
You oversimplify things, Voiello.

35:58.220 --> 36:01.220
Today was the first day
in a long while,

36:02.060 --> 36:04.340
I was unable to speak with God.

36:05.741 --> 36:07.581
The words that came to me
were ugly.

36:09.421 --> 36:12.261
Ugly? How?

36:14.301 --> 36:15.382
False.

36:21.262 --> 36:27.063
And just like that, the flower
blossomed, right before my eyes.

36:30.503 --> 36:33.823
I placed a hand on my belly
and whispered:

36:34.663 --> 36:37.544
"I feel it, Holy Father, I feel it."

36:38.584 --> 36:41.184
And Pius the XIIlth

36:43.624 --> 36:46.225
without looking at me,
closed his eyes and said,

36:47.345 --> 36:50.665
in a voice filled with grace:

36:52.105 --> 36:53.585
"I feel it too, Ester.

36:56.386 --> 37:00.506
Yes, you are pregnant,
and you will have a beautiful baby boy.

37:02.506 --> 37:05.467
But please,
let's not call it a miracle.

37:07.427 --> 37:10.027
Let's let mystery
remain mystery."

37:15.468 --> 37:18.708
Beautiful, beautiful, Ester.

37:19.828 --> 37:24.148
Your story gives us joy,
it restore us our hope.

37:25.509 --> 37:27.509
Yes, hope!

37:33.189 --> 37:36.070
200 euro?
We agreed on 500!

37:36.670 --> 37:40.030
Please don't you start busting
my balls. I'm already late.

37:40.350 --> 37:41.870
200 it's all I can give you.

37:42.350 --> 37:46.271
Besides, you've already told
that miracle bullshit 1 000 times,

37:46.431 --> 37:48.031
on every TV in the world.

37:57.952 --> 37:59.192
Do you like it?

38:02.632 --> 38:04.953
Do you come here
to pray or to drink?

38:06.073 --> 38:10.593
First he drinks
then he prays to God to help him stop.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.354
Barolo Anversano.

38:21.154 --> 38:23.394
- To Brannox?
- To Brannox!

38:27.795 --> 38:30.155
You're really sure
he'll be the new pope?

38:30.675 --> 38:34.596
- I've got an insider very reliable.
- Who?

38:35.316 --> 38:39.756
- My wife.
- Your plan is brilliant, Tomas.

38:40.916 --> 38:43.637
You give a new luster
to the term wheeler-dealer.

38:44.917 --> 38:49.117
I don't understand why you are so sure
you can get into Brannox's good graces.

38:50.357 --> 38:52.077
Relax, Guicciardini. Relax.

38:52.717 --> 38:54.998
I am the Minister
of Economy and Finance.

38:55.078 --> 38:56.878
Do you realize how exposed I am?

38:57.358 --> 39:00.998
Please don't tell me to relax because
that only makes me more upset.

39:02.438 --> 39:05.279
Guicciardini, look the point is this:

39:06.319 --> 39:09.719
it's not me who will want
to get into Brannox's good graces.

39:10.439 --> 39:13.200
It's Brannox, the new pope,

39:14.320 --> 39:16.600
who will want
to get into my good graces.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.080
I don't understand.

39:20.960 --> 39:23.641
In the Vatican,
whoever knows the pope's secret

39:23.881 --> 39:25.721
becomes in reality the pope.

39:26.681 --> 39:29.361
Guess who the only person is

39:29.721 --> 39:33.362
who knows the pope's
unspeakable secret?

39:36.682 --> 39:37.762
You?

39:38.482 --> 39:41.202
You're a quick learner, Dullio,
for a populist.

39:43.283 --> 39:44.403
What's the secret?

40:23.607 --> 40:28.327
Can you picture these photos
on lighters, key chains, ashtrays?

40:29.447 --> 40:33.128
I can imagine a healthy sale
of papal gadgets. Can't you?

40:34.288 --> 40:37.288
I am thinking bigger than that.

40:38.328 --> 40:42.169
I can imagine
a healthy trade of souls.

40:45.729 --> 40:49.449
He did finally say
"I don't know."

40:50.329 --> 40:53.850
If you ask me,
"I don't know" means "yes."

40:54.410 --> 41:00.050
But he is still so wary, so diffident.
He's studying us.

41:00.890 --> 41:03.931
But we are supposed
to be studying him.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.531
What is there to study?

41:06.011 --> 41:09.331
He has all the necessary
qualifications to make a great pope:

41:10.171 --> 41:15.132
the soporific calm that is in perfect
harmony with the Vatican's heartbeat.

41:16.132 --> 41:20.252
The charisma to make people
forget the recent past.

41:21.372 --> 41:25.493
The moral equilibrium to defuse
the turbulence of the present.

41:25.773 --> 41:29.053
- And what about the future?
- Don't be so naive, Aguirre.

41:29.533 --> 41:32.974
The Church doesn't have time
to worry about the future.

41:33.254 --> 41:38.334
What's more, he is persuasive,
seductive, he envelops you.

41:39.654 --> 41:41.695
The man
seems to be made of velvet.

41:42.735 --> 41:44.095
What do you think, Eminence?

41:47.295 --> 41:51.095
I think we have to hurry.
We don't have much time.

41:51.976 --> 41:56.936
We must raise the question directly.
Leave the talking to me.

41:57.576 --> 42:02.057
Ma'am, Eminences,
Sir John would like to speak with you.

42:04.617 --> 42:09.417
Eminence, might I have a word,
in private?

42:11.178 --> 42:14.018
I have been looking
after Sir John since he was a boy.

42:15.418 --> 42:17.098
He is a magnificent person,

42:19.058 --> 42:24.379
but he is also fragile, delicate.

42:26.019 --> 42:27.339
A piece of porcelain.

42:28.339 --> 42:32.140
Beautiful, glazed,
and molded by great artists,

42:32.340 --> 42:35.300
but a piece of porcelain
nevertheless.

42:37.340 --> 42:40.380
His life has been burdened
with crippling sorrows

42:41.741 --> 42:43.861
and unspeakable disappointments.

42:44.301 --> 42:46.821
We will not be
another disappointment.

42:47.461 --> 42:51.582
Sir John will become pope
at the first round of voting.

42:52.182 --> 42:56.982
It will be the swiftest conclave
in history. I promise.

43:24.905 --> 43:29.905
- I am a fragile, delicate man.
- True. A piece of porcelain.

43:30.826 --> 43:34.026
- Am I right?
- A beautiful piece of porcelain.

43:34.426 --> 43:36.746
Perhaps what you need
is a man of steel.

43:37.306 --> 43:42.907
No. That is what lay governments
and stupid people need.

43:44.147 --> 43:48.907
We are the Church, Sir John.
Our duty is love.

43:50.988 --> 43:54.068
- Do you know what I crave?
- What?

43:54.668 --> 43:56.868
That you would speak to me
of this love.

43:58.668 --> 44:03.989
Now I will truly be honest,
Sir John.

44:04.989 --> 44:10.150
I am rather weak on that topic.
I would risk ruining everything.

44:11.070 --> 44:15.990
Perhaps Monsegnor Gutierrez
will speak to me of love.

44:27.871 --> 44:33.632
Love is an abstract concept
but a necessary one.

44:36.952 --> 44:39.553
Like happiness, like intelligence...

44:42.233 --> 44:43.393
Like God.

44:49.274 --> 44:50.754
When I was a boy...

44:55.394 --> 44:56.914
a man took advantage of me.

44:58.154 --> 45:02.515
And as he did so, he would say:

45:05.475 --> 45:06.915
"God does not exist."

45:09.756 --> 45:13.316
And I would answer back,
in God's place:

45:15.556 --> 45:18.356
"Even if He doesn't exist,

45:21.557 --> 45:24.117
we desperately need
to believe He is there."

45:41.319 --> 45:43.719
And you, Eminence?
What is love to you?

45:47.839 --> 45:51.240
A vagrant
lays dying on a street corner.

45:51.400 --> 45:54.280
The government says to him:
I'll help you.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.440
The doctor says to him:
I'll cure you.

45:58.441 --> 46:01.401
His daughter says to him:
I'll give you money.

46:02.081 --> 46:05.201
His friend says to him:
I'll share my wine with you.

46:09.082 --> 46:11.562
And the Church
says nothing to him.

46:15.162 --> 46:17.442
The Church
is thinking about him.

46:23.003 --> 46:24.563
Would you accept, Eminence?

46:26.083 --> 46:30.284
Tonight I will search
for the answer hidden in my heart.

46:32.164 --> 46:35.644
Tonight the Church
is thinking about that vagrant.

46:37.724 --> 46:41.245
And I will be thinking
about the Church.

47:51.132 --> 47:53.372
Our hatred is concrete.

47:53.572 --> 47:55.692
Our enemy is obvious.

47:55.892 --> 47:57.373
It's Iblis.

47:57.573 --> 47:59.533
It's the Christian.

47:59.733 --> 48:03.653
And as the Koran says:

48:04.333 --> 48:09.934
I will fill Hell with you all,
you and all those after you.
