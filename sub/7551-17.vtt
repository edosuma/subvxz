[Gun cocks]

01:05.391 --> 01:08.661
Oh, God. Shoot me now.

01:08.695 --> 01:10.668
[Sighs]
I'd rather not.

01:10.879 --> 01:12.033
What's up?

01:12.053 --> 01:14.082
Anson Klemp has just
been promoted to captain.

01:14.102 --> 01:16.034
He's gonna run the 9-2.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.604
Who's Anson Klemp, and why
hasn't he changed his name?

01:19.639 --> 01:21.005
We went to the academy together.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.608
Ohhh. And he's
your sworn Nemesis.

01:23.643 --> 01:25.967
- No. He was my friend.
- So he's grossly underqualified?

01:25.987 --> 01:27.543
No. He's great.

01:28.473 --> 01:30.648
- So, then, what's the problem?
- Me.

01:31.911 --> 01:34.686
We started together,
we graduated the same year,

01:34.720 --> 01:36.487
and he's gonna be captain,
and I'm just...

01:36.521 --> 01:38.857
The best homicide detective
in the city?

01:39.068 --> 01:40.922
No. Falling behind.

01:40.942 --> 01:42.493
[Cellphone rings]

01:44.792 --> 01:47.130
You know what you've got?
Patterson syndrome.

01:47.165 --> 01:48.566
Hm. Patterson syndrome?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.426
Yeah, every time
I write a bestseller,

01:50.446 --> 01:52.369
Patterson writes like six.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.954
It's maddening.
But comparing myself to him

01:54.974 --> 01:56.910
does not make me write any faster.
[Sighs]

01:56.930 --> 01:58.598
I guess I just thought
that I would be

01:58.618 --> 02:01.738
in more of a leadership
position by now.

02:01.758 --> 02:02.768
I don't know.

02:02.788 --> 02:05.463
Maybe I shouldn't have left
the A.G.'s office in D.C.

02:05.483 --> 02:08.515
Except you didn't want to compromise
yourself to play their game.

02:09.586 --> 02:10.553
Well, I feel like

02:10.588 --> 02:13.194
maybe there's something more
I should be doing.

02:13.214 --> 02:16.326
Ryan: Hey, Castles.
Our victim is one Henry Graham.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.325
Took a single GSW to the chest
around midnight.

02:18.345 --> 02:20.000
So someone must have
heard the gunshot.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.769
- Do we have a witness?
- As a matter of fact, yes...

02:21.789 --> 02:23.599
that jogger right there.

02:23.634 --> 02:24.939
Did he see the murder?

02:24.959 --> 02:26.775
No, but the killer
was still looking

02:26.795 --> 02:28.972
through the Vic's pockets
when he jogged up.

02:29.006 --> 02:31.208
- I'm surprised he didn't get shot, too.
- So is he.

02:31.242 --> 02:32.809
She had the drop on him
but told him to run...

02:32.844 --> 02:34.010
probably set a personal best.

02:34.045 --> 02:35.726
Our killer's a she?

02:35.746 --> 02:38.481
Asian female, mid-30s,
well-dressed.

02:38.501 --> 02:40.731
Doesn't fit the profile
of a typical mugger.

02:40.751 --> 02:41.617
Neither does the stuff

02:41.652 --> 02:43.553
that she took
from the Vic's pockets.

02:43.587 --> 02:45.855
She made off with
his cellphone and his keys

02:45.889 --> 02:48.257
but left his wallet
and 200 bucks in cash.

02:48.291 --> 02:51.661
So this was more than
just a late-night stick-up.

02:51.695 --> 02:53.695
Why don't we get the witness
together with a sketch artist?

02:53.729 --> 02:55.230
Already in the works.

02:55.265 --> 02:57.166
And to hear the jogger tell it,

02:57.200 --> 02:58.567
this chick was cool as can be.

02:58.601 --> 02:59.970
She may be a pro.

02:59.990 --> 03:01.036
Does raise the question...

03:01.071 --> 03:03.019
what was Henry doing here
so late at night?

03:03.039 --> 03:05.447
Waiting for someone.
CSU found cigarette butts

03:05.467 --> 03:08.251
that match
the pack in his pocket.

03:08.698 --> 03:09.981
Esposito:
And if he <i>was</i> up to no good,

03:10.001 --> 03:11.383
it wouldn't be his first time.

03:11.403 --> 03:13.803
He did a nickel at elmira
for aggravated assault...

03:13.823 --> 03:15.474
got out a few years ago.

03:18.420 --> 03:20.188
He's still got
his work uniform on,

03:20.222 --> 03:22.290
so let's see
if anyone at go quick towing

03:22.324 --> 03:24.496
- knows how he wound up here.
- Esposito: Let's go.

03:26.418 --> 03:28.429
Gus: He wasn't on the job,
I can tell you that.

03:28.464 --> 03:29.930
We didn't have any pickups
out that way,

03:29.965 --> 03:31.632
so I don't know
what he was doing there.

03:31.666 --> 03:32.533
Well, who would?

03:32.568 --> 03:34.102
Did he have any family?

03:34.136 --> 03:35.470
He doesn't.

03:35.504 --> 03:37.472
He didn't even have a girl,
I don't think.

03:37.506 --> 03:38.973
Poor guy.

03:39.007 --> 03:41.075
I don't know. I just...
I just can't get over it.

03:41.110 --> 03:44.377
Uh... Henry was my top driver.

03:44.412 --> 03:46.446
Just a...
just a real stand-up guy.

03:46.481 --> 03:48.448
- Even though he had a record?
- So do I.

03:48.483 --> 03:51.619
There's not a lot of jobs
out there for ex-cons.

03:51.653 --> 03:54.637
But Henry, he, uh,
he was out of the life,

03:54.657 --> 03:56.657
so I gave him a shot,
and I never regretted it.

03:56.691 --> 03:58.891
Did he have problems
with anyone that you know of?

03:58.926 --> 04:00.727
Oh, yeah.
Henry got threatened every day.

04:00.761 --> 04:02.061
He did? By whom?

04:02.096 --> 04:03.563
All kinds of people.

04:03.598 --> 04:05.932
Waving bats, knives, guns...
you name it.

04:05.966 --> 04:08.401
Wait a minute. I thought
that he was a tow-truck driver.

04:08.436 --> 04:10.737
Specializing
in vehicle recovery.

04:11.308 --> 04:12.839
Henry was a repo man?

04:12.873 --> 04:14.907
And folks aren't that excited

04:14.942 --> 04:16.942
when we take their cars away.

04:16.976 --> 04:18.476
So, these threats that he got...

04:18.512 --> 04:20.411
did any of them
ever come from an asian woman?

04:20.447 --> 04:22.148
Not that I can remember.

04:22.182 --> 04:24.012
But listen, detective,

04:24.260 --> 04:26.585
some of the people we deal with
are pissed off,

04:26.620 --> 04:28.521
but they're mad at the banks,
not us.

04:28.555 --> 04:29.956
I mean, I can't believe

04:29.990 --> 04:32.424
anyone would hunt Henry down
to kill him.

04:32.459 --> 04:34.460
Still, we'll need
a list of the repos.

04:34.494 --> 04:36.029
Yeah. Sure.

04:36.364 --> 04:38.138
Wait a minute.

04:38.158 --> 04:40.466
Maybe this
has something to do with

04:40.500 --> 04:42.434
what happened yesterday
at lunch.

04:42.469 --> 04:43.469
What do you mean?

04:43.503 --> 04:45.671
Well, he went out to lunch
like he normally does,

04:45.705 --> 04:48.040
and when he came back,
he was all shook up.

04:48.074 --> 04:50.175
- What about?
- He wouldn't say.

04:50.209 --> 04:52.044
He left mid-shift,
without a word.

04:52.078 --> 04:53.979
And he left the yard,
didn't come back.

04:54.013 --> 04:55.781
That was
the last I ever saw him.

04:55.815 --> 04:57.949
And where exactly
did he go to lunch?

04:57.984 --> 04:59.084
I don't know,

04:59.118 --> 05:01.653
but there was something else
he did that was strange.

05:01.688 --> 05:03.655
My alarm guy told me
that Henry was asking

05:03.690 --> 05:07.659
for access codes
to a 2013 X5 a few days ago.

05:07.693 --> 05:08.593
What was strange about that?

05:08.627 --> 05:12.163
We don't have any 2013 X5s
on our repo list.

05:16.314 --> 05:18.303
Beckett: So, I spoke
to Henry's colleagues.

05:18.337 --> 05:21.471
None of them knows
where he went to lunch yesterday

05:21.506 --> 05:23.808
or why he was asking
for the X5 codes.

05:23.842 --> 05:26.077
Maybe our repo man
was actually stealing cars.

05:26.111 --> 05:27.712
He clearly had the skill set.

05:27.746 --> 05:29.714
Yeah, but from everything
that everyone said,

05:29.748 --> 05:31.682
including Henry's
former parole officer,

05:31.717 --> 05:33.751
he was just a stand-up citizen.

05:33.785 --> 05:36.053
Yeah, that's because
he was concealing

05:36.088 --> 05:37.387
his car-stealing ways.

05:37.422 --> 05:39.923
Even his boss said
he was a very private guy.

05:39.957 --> 05:43.093
So, unbeknownst to anyone,
Henry sets his eyes on an X5.

05:43.127 --> 05:44.595
He gets the alarm codes.

05:44.629 --> 05:46.530
But, in a fateful error,

05:46.564 --> 05:49.766
he steals the X5
belonging to this woman...

05:49.800 --> 05:51.368
a triad assassin.

05:51.402 --> 05:52.755
An assassin?

05:52.775 --> 05:54.437
Really? Again?

05:54.471 --> 05:56.339
Come on. This time, it fits.

05:56.373 --> 05:57.207
How does it fit?

05:57.241 --> 05:59.042
He steals her car,
and she kills him?

05:59.076 --> 06:01.044
Why doesn't she just
put in an insurance claim

06:01.078 --> 06:01.911
and call it a day?

06:01.946 --> 06:02.678
Ah!

06:02.713 --> 06:04.914
Because it wasn't about the car.

06:04.949 --> 06:07.050
See, when Henry
stole the vehicle,

06:07.084 --> 06:08.684
he took something of value
from the inside.

06:08.719 --> 06:10.686
That's what the assassin
was trying to retrieve

06:10.721 --> 06:11.687
from his pocket.

06:11.722 --> 06:13.522
And said stolen item was...?

06:14.324 --> 06:15.625
Cold fusion technology.

06:15.659 --> 06:17.760
A genetically engineered
super-virus.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.563
Some secret unpublished
"Harry Potter" manuscript.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.046
Actually, one thing that you
said does make sense.

06:23.066 --> 06:23.734
One thing?

06:23.754 --> 06:26.235
The X5 might have something
to do with Henry's death.

06:26.270 --> 06:28.147
You know what...
I'm gonna call auto theft

06:28.167 --> 06:30.976
and see if there are any
reported stolen X5s recently.

06:30.996 --> 06:33.575
- From a triad assassin.
- She's not a triad assassin.

06:33.609 --> 06:35.310
We don't know that.

06:35.344 --> 06:37.913
This is just so terrible.
Henry was such a decent man.

06:37.947 --> 06:39.714
I wish
all my tenants were like him.

06:39.749 --> 06:40.582
I'm sure you do.

06:40.616 --> 06:43.051
Ma'am, have you seen
this woman before?

06:43.086 --> 06:44.118
[Sighs]

06:44.752 --> 06:47.255
Well, I... I believe I have.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.897
Here, in this building?

06:48.917 --> 06:49.891
Why, yes.

06:49.925 --> 06:51.559
We passed each other
in the hall.

06:51.594 --> 06:52.761
She was headed for Henry's unit.

06:52.795 --> 06:53.795
When was this?

06:53.829 --> 06:55.530
Oh, about 10 minutes ago.

06:55.911 --> 06:57.799
- 10 minutes ago?
- Uh, maybe less.

06:57.833 --> 07:00.101
Does she have something to do
with what happened to Henry?

07:00.135 --> 07:01.502
Ma'am, what's Henry's
apartment number?

07:01.536 --> 07:03.104
Uh, 517.

07:07.976 --> 07:09.777

Here's his backup.

07:54.555 --> 07:56.041

Esposito: You better
think this through.

08:13.888 --> 08:15.465
We're cops.

08:15.485 --> 08:17.016
So am I.

08:18.659 --> 08:20.278
Hong Kong P.D.

08:20.298 --> 08:23.293
Now, who's the lead investigator
on this case?

08:23.988 --> 08:25.936
You're awfully far
from Hong Kong,

08:25.956 --> 08:28.201
Chief Inspector Zhang.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.470
Are these handcuffs
truly necessary?

08:31.504 --> 08:34.071
You attacked
two NYPD detectives.

08:34.091 --> 08:36.217
Only because I had no idea
they were police.

08:36.238 --> 08:40.513
So, you mean to tell me
she got both your guns?

08:40.533 --> 08:42.448
Hey, you... you weren't there.

08:42.467 --> 08:44.695
She's fast.

08:44.715 --> 08:47.276
I mean, like, crazy fast.

08:47.354 --> 08:48.988
Please. She ain't all that.

08:49.022 --> 08:50.723
And yet she got both your guns.

08:53.380 --> 08:54.961
It says here
that you are a part of

08:54.995 --> 08:58.097
a U.S./Chinese
organized-crime task force

08:58.131 --> 09:00.233
based in San Francisco.

09:00.267 --> 09:01.667
What are you doing in New York?

09:01.701 --> 09:03.802
Detective, let's
cut to the chase, shall we?

09:03.837 --> 09:05.218
I am not the murderer.

09:05.238 --> 09:07.806
So, do you always make a habit
of finding dead bodies

09:07.841 --> 09:09.808
and relieving them
of their belongings?

09:09.843 --> 09:10.976
I know Henry.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.344
Rather, I <i>knew</i> him.

09:12.379 --> 09:13.412
How?

09:14.647 --> 09:15.614
It's complicated.

09:15.648 --> 09:17.850
Was he involved
in one of your investigations?

09:17.884 --> 09:19.084
He was a friend.

09:19.118 --> 09:20.785
We hadn't seen each other
in years.

09:20.819 --> 09:22.354
We made plans to meet here
in the city,

09:22.388 --> 09:24.522
and then he called me
and told me he couldn't come.

09:24.556 --> 09:26.091
He sounded frightened.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.458
I asked him what was going on,

09:27.493 --> 09:28.927
and he told me
he was in trouble.

09:28.961 --> 09:30.780
- What kind of trouble?
- He wouldn't say.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.830
I called back.
He never answered.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.566
I was worried,
so I flew out right away.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.171
How did you end up
at the crime scene?

09:43.308 --> 09:44.975
When Henry
didn't return my calls,

09:45.010 --> 09:46.878
I had a colleague
in San Francisco ping his cell.

09:46.912 --> 09:48.513
So you found him in the park?

09:48.547 --> 09:50.752
When I got there,
he was already dead.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.284
So I took his phone
and his keys,

09:53.318 --> 09:54.601
and I began to investigate.

09:54.621 --> 09:56.120
And why didn't you call us
from the crime scene?

09:56.154 --> 09:57.687
'Cause I didn't want
to waste my time

09:57.722 --> 09:59.156
having <i>this</i> conversation.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.490
My friend has been murdered.

10:00.525 --> 10:01.959
I have to find out who did it.

10:01.993 --> 10:04.328
No. <i>I</i> do.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.332
Detective,
I just got off with the TSA.

10:08.366 --> 10:11.243
Chief Inspector Zhang's flight
didn't arrive until midnight.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.404
Which is when Henry was killed.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.172
She couldn't have done it.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.411
Now may I go?
[Sighs]

10:21.431 --> 10:23.880
As long as you promise that
you're not gonna work this case.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.582
That's a promise I cannot make.

10:25.616 --> 10:27.892
And you no longer
have cause to hold me.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.807
Chief Inspector,
in the interest of all parties,

10:32.827 --> 10:36.025
perhaps you should consider
working <i>with</i> us.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.609
[Handcuffs click]

10:38.795 --> 10:42.008
I would like my personal effects
returned to me now.

10:55.371 --> 10:57.179
Take a peek at this.

10:57.213 --> 10:59.047
It's Zhang's personnel file.

10:59.082 --> 11:01.016
She's more than just some cop.

11:01.050 --> 11:04.019
Wait a minute,
that U.S./Chinese task force...

11:04.053 --> 11:05.253
she's not just on it.

11:05.288 --> 11:06.763
She's running it?

11:08.885 --> 11:09.757
Wow.

11:09.792 --> 11:12.094
Commendations, citations.

11:12.128 --> 11:13.650
Oh, my gosh, she is impressive.

11:13.670 --> 11:15.563
Oh, sure, on paper.

11:15.598 --> 11:17.365
What about the way
she schooled Ryan and Esposito?

11:17.399 --> 11:18.466
Was that just on paper?

11:18.501 --> 11:19.801
Zhang: Captain.

11:19.835 --> 11:22.103
I've been thinking
about your proposal,

11:22.137 --> 11:25.106
and I do see the advantage
of us working together.

11:25.140 --> 11:27.244
Does the offer still stand?

11:28.844 --> 11:30.085
Yes.

11:31.780 --> 11:33.114
Okay.

11:33.148 --> 11:34.048
Then let's start with this.

11:34.082 --> 11:36.083
You had mentioned
that before Henry died,

11:36.118 --> 11:37.869
he had gone to lunch
and returned upset.

11:37.889 --> 11:40.721
I found that receipt
in his pocket.

11:40.755 --> 11:43.057
From the Jade Temple Restaurant
in Chinatown.

11:43.091 --> 11:44.791
It's time-stamped
yesterday afternoon.

11:44.826 --> 11:46.327
Why don't the three of you
check it out,

11:46.361 --> 11:48.262
see if there's anything
about his lunch

11:48.296 --> 11:50.497
- that can explain why he got killed.
- Okay.

11:50.532 --> 11:52.599
Hi. I'm Castle.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.134
We're partners.

11:54.168 --> 11:55.402
Act... we're also married.

11:55.436 --> 11:56.637
- Interesting arrangement.
- Yeah.

11:56.671 --> 11:57.905
This is gonna be fun...

11:57.939 --> 11:59.754
this little threesome here.

12:00.499 --> 12:02.009
Investigatively speaking.

12:02.043 --> 12:03.610
I don't want to...
didn't mean to...

12:03.645 --> 12:04.811
I'm not trying to imply that...

12:04.846 --> 12:07.784
- Quit while you're behind.
- Yeah.

12:12.053 --> 12:13.586
Oh, thank you. Mm-hmm.

12:15.705 --> 12:17.318
Hello. Table for three?

12:17.338 --> 12:21.127
Uh, no, not today.
Detective Beckett, NYPD.

12:21.422 --> 12:23.095
You are the police?

12:23.129 --> 12:25.097
I'm Mimi Tan.
This is my establishment.

12:25.131 --> 12:26.699
What can I do for you?

12:26.733 --> 12:28.200
We'd like to ask you
some questions

12:28.234 --> 12:30.015
about one of your customers.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.139
Oh. Not <i>one</i> of my customers...
he's my <i>number-one</i> customer.

12:34.174 --> 12:35.775
Henry eats here every day.

12:35.809 --> 12:37.910
Not anymore. He was murdered.

12:39.328 --> 12:40.780
This is tragic.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.548
When Henry was here yesterday,

12:42.582 --> 12:44.049
did he say
that anything was wrong

12:44.084 --> 12:46.185
or that he was
having problems with anyone?

12:46.219 --> 12:47.486
No, I don't think so.

12:47.520 --> 12:48.737
Her.

12:50.323 --> 12:52.157
Was she working here yesterday?

12:52.192 --> 12:53.892
Suyin? Yes.

12:53.926 --> 12:56.232
- I'll go talk to her.
- I'll go talk to her.

12:59.870 --> 13:02.033
What if I just stay here
and wait?

13:02.068 --> 13:03.434
Uh, yeah.

13:06.832 --> 13:08.006
Beckett: Uh, Suyin?

13:08.040 --> 13:10.075
Detective Beckett, NYPD.

13:10.109 --> 13:11.576
We'd like a word.

13:11.596 --> 13:12.910
I don't want trouble.

13:12.944 --> 13:14.579
No, no, you're not
in any trouble.

13:14.613 --> 13:16.046
We need you to
ask you a few questions.

13:16.081 --> 13:18.749
[Speaking mandarin]

13:18.783 --> 13:20.851
[Speaking mandarin]

13:20.885 --> 13:23.621
I know nothing. I must work now.

13:24.902 --> 13:26.524
She knows
more than she's letting on.

13:26.558 --> 13:28.191
It's like she's afraid
to talk to us.

13:28.226 --> 13:29.994
Us, or perhaps <i>you.</i>

13:30.028 --> 13:33.196
Her dialect indicates that
she's from the Chongqing region.

13:33.231 --> 13:35.232
The police corruption
is rampant there.

13:35.266 --> 13:36.934
Let me talk to her
in her native language...

13:36.968 --> 13:38.862
put her at ease.

13:44.142 --> 13:45.374
Um...

13:45.394 --> 13:47.544
Did she just
take over your interview?

13:47.578 --> 13:49.078
Yeah.

13:49.113 --> 13:51.014
Okay, she's
more than qualified, Castle.

13:51.048 --> 13:53.049
Did you know that she was
the youngest officer

13:53.083 --> 13:54.251
to become chief inspector?

13:54.285 --> 13:55.718
She has cleared more murders

13:55.753 --> 13:57.687
than anyone
in Hong Kong P.D. history.

13:57.721 --> 13:59.722
Okay, so she's good at her job.

13:59.757 --> 14:01.290
Not just that.
[Cellphone clicks]

14:01.324 --> 14:03.292
Take a look at her husband.

14:03.326 --> 14:05.227
Action-movie star.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.588
Yes, well,
I'm a highly paid novelist.

14:07.608 --> 14:09.313
What about the kids?

14:09.934 --> 14:11.400
Cute, huh?

14:11.434 --> 14:13.391
[Chuckling] Ohhh.

14:15.305 --> 14:17.106
I've seen cuter. That's...

14:17.141 --> 14:19.770
Please, tell me you're not
comparing yourself to her.

14:20.154 --> 14:22.378
Oh. We're...

14:23.886 --> 14:26.315
She said there was
an incident yesterday.

14:26.349 --> 14:27.816
A customer refused
to order lunch.

14:27.850 --> 14:29.681
He said he was
waiting for someone.

14:29.701 --> 14:32.492
Apparently, he just checked
his e-mail until Henry arrived.

14:32.493 --> 14:35.290
He joined Henry at his table,
and an argument broke out.

14:35.324 --> 14:37.793
Then he finally left,
but not before he told Henry,

14:37.827 --> 14:39.769
"you cannot
walk away from this."

14:39.789 --> 14:41.663
Does Suyin know
what they were fighting about?

14:41.698 --> 14:43.465
No, she didn't
get a good look at him.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.966
She said he was white, 40s,

14:45.001 --> 14:47.193
average height,
average weight...

14:50.907 --> 14:53.441
Is there a password
required for the wi-fi?

14:53.475 --> 14:55.277
No. Wi-fi is free.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.333
What are you thinking?

14:56.353 --> 14:58.713
If the man connected
his phone to the wi-fi,

14:58.747 --> 15:00.982
the router would have logged
his unique M.A.C. address.

15:01.017 --> 15:03.084
We can use that
and track his name.

15:03.519 --> 15:04.552
Did you see that?

15:04.586 --> 15:08.084
She might've just broken
this case with a wi-fi sign.

15:08.104 --> 15:10.558
Yes, yes, I'm impressed.
Are you happy?

15:10.592 --> 15:12.059
No, Castle.

15:12.093 --> 15:13.193
She's just like me...

15:13.228 --> 15:14.838
only better.

15:17.999 --> 15:20.635
Zhang: So, I traced all the devices
that used the restaurant's wi-fi

15:20.669 --> 15:21.869
during the time Henry was there.

15:21.904 --> 15:23.337
Only one is owned by a man

15:23.371 --> 15:25.105
fitting
our suspect's description.

15:26.674 --> 15:27.707
Michael Glassman.

15:27.742 --> 15:29.743
Good. We should send
a copy of this over to Suyin.

15:29.777 --> 15:31.845
I already did, and she
positively identified him

15:31.879 --> 15:33.747
as the one Henry was
having the argument with.

15:33.781 --> 15:36.183
Does Glassman
have a criminal record?

15:36.217 --> 15:38.656
Actually, quite the opposite.

15:43.123 --> 15:44.891
Wait a minute. Is this right?

15:44.926 --> 15:46.860
What? Who is this guy?

15:48.228 --> 15:50.075
He's an FBI agent.

15:55.503 --> 15:56.502
Agent Glassman?

15:56.536 --> 15:58.437
Hi. I'm Detective Beckett.

15:58.471 --> 16:00.706
- This is Mr. Castle.
- Hello.

16:01.597 --> 16:02.557
Thank you for coming in.

16:02.577 --> 16:06.156
Well, we're on the same team,
right? Law-enforcement synergy.

16:06.176 --> 16:08.014
So, what can I do for the NYPD?

16:08.048 --> 16:09.715
We're looking into
the death of Henry Graham,

16:09.749 --> 16:11.717
and we were hoping that
you could fill in the blanks.

16:11.751 --> 16:13.420
Henry Graham?

16:13.440 --> 16:16.108
I'm afraid that name
doesn't ring a bell.

16:16.455 --> 16:18.223
Uh, this man right here.

16:18.257 --> 16:20.191
You don't recognize him?

16:20.226 --> 16:22.022
No, I don't.

16:23.412 --> 16:26.698
Agent Glassman, we know that
you had contact with our victim.

16:26.733 --> 16:30.695
You were seen with him yesterday
at the Jade Temple Restaurant,

16:30.715 --> 16:32.971
together,
having a heated argument.

16:33.005 --> 16:35.902
Somebody gave you a bum tip.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.476
I was never at any Jade Temple.

16:38.510 --> 16:39.710
Your <i>phone</i> was,

16:39.745 --> 16:42.747
along with someone who bore
a striking resemblance to you.

16:42.781 --> 16:45.756
And then, hours later,
Henry ended up dead.

16:47.052 --> 16:49.335
Where were you
at midnight last night?

16:51.035 --> 16:54.323
Trust me, Detective Beckett,
you do not want to go there.

16:56.528 --> 16:57.394
[Door opens]

16:57.429 --> 16:59.730
Well, so much
for lawenforcement synergy.

16:59.765 --> 17:02.833
He out-and-out lied
about knowing Henry.

17:02.867 --> 17:04.701
He's in this thing
up to his bolo tie.

17:04.734 --> 17:06.502
Only we don't know what this is.

17:06.537 --> 17:07.404
You know, I'm gonna see

17:07.439 --> 17:09.573
if Captain Gates
can talk to the bureau.

17:09.607 --> 17:11.730
Maybe she can
shake some info loose.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.821
How about you?
Do you have anything?

17:12.842 --> 17:15.579
Uh, yeah, but I'm not quite sure
what to make of it yet.

17:15.613 --> 17:18.319
The lab found
a phenolformaldehyde resin

17:18.339 --> 17:19.858
on the bottom of Henry's shoes.

17:19.877 --> 17:21.550
Formaldehyde?
Like for embalming?

17:21.586 --> 17:24.119
Yeah, for embalming,
making circuit boards,

17:24.154 --> 17:26.356
treatment of fabrics...
all kinds of stuff.

17:26.390 --> 17:29.025
They think that he must have been
somewhere where that chemical was used

17:29.059 --> 17:30.549
right before he died.

17:30.569 --> 17:32.228
Maybe he stepped
in the formaldehyde

17:32.262 --> 17:33.930
right before he stole the X5.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.865
He didn't Jack any X5.
I checked.

17:35.899 --> 17:37.200
There were no x5s
reported stolen.

17:37.234 --> 17:38.634
So what was he doing
with those alarm codes?

17:38.668 --> 17:40.636
And if Henry left work
at 2:00 p.m.,

17:40.670 --> 17:41.804
showed up dead at midnight,

17:41.838 --> 17:43.572
he's unaccounted for
for 10 hours,

17:43.607 --> 17:45.541
so where was he
during that time?

17:45.575 --> 17:47.576
Well, he didn't own a car,
so I'll check the activity

17:47.611 --> 17:49.945
on his Metro and credit cards,
see if he went anywhere.

17:49.980 --> 17:51.780
I'll circle back with his
neighbors, see if they saw him.

17:51.815 --> 17:53.248
Okay. Call me
if you guys find anything.

17:53.282 --> 17:54.282
- Ryan: Yeah.
- Whew.

17:54.317 --> 17:55.484
For a second there, I thought

17:55.519 --> 17:58.387
I was gonna get stuck doing
thankless grunt work tonight.

17:59.823 --> 18:00.723
Castle.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.291
We're standing right here.

18:03.326 --> 18:03.893
What?

18:03.927 --> 18:05.460
Beckett: Oh. Tonight.

18:05.495 --> 18:07.095
Sorry, um,
I forgot to tell you...

18:07.130 --> 18:08.630
I'm going out
with Zhang tonight.

18:08.664 --> 18:09.564
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

18:09.598 --> 18:12.600
Is, um... you t-think
that's a good idea?

18:12.635 --> 18:14.569
Yeah. I mean,
we're working together.

18:14.603 --> 18:16.405
We should get to
know each other better.

18:16.439 --> 18:18.596
Anyway, don't wait up
for me, okay?

18:19.464 --> 18:20.942
Bye.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.411
[Esposito clears throat]

18:22.445 --> 18:24.244
Take a seat, Castle.

18:24.666 --> 18:28.616
Ryan: Let me tell you
a little something about life.

18:28.997 --> 18:32.286
You see, what you did there,
Castle... rookie mistake.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.482
What'd I do?

18:33.502 --> 18:34.856
You tried to stop her.

18:34.890 --> 18:37.091
I mean, Jenny...
she's got her girls' nights,

18:37.125 --> 18:39.027
and I'm...
I'm totally fine with that.

18:39.061 --> 18:41.795
You see, in a marriage,

18:41.829 --> 18:44.031
you have to give your partner
some space.

18:44.066 --> 18:46.667
[Chuckling] Okay, Ryan.

18:46.701 --> 18:47.668
[Clears throat]

18:47.702 --> 18:50.471
Uh, this is my third marriage.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.252
I think I know what I'm doing.

18:56.311 --> 18:59.345
Rrrrrrrichard...

18:59.380 --> 19:00.881
Why don't you want her to go?

19:00.915 --> 19:04.350
Guys, it's no secret
that Zhang is accomplished

19:04.385 --> 19:07.054
and that Beckett
admires her for that.

19:07.088 --> 19:08.622
E...

19:08.656 --> 19:09.623
Even envies her.

19:09.657 --> 19:10.791
So if they hang out,

19:10.825 --> 19:13.526
I'm just afraid it's gonna be
some weird competition.

19:13.561 --> 19:14.360
[Both laugh]

19:14.395 --> 19:16.151
Come on.
Beckett would never do that.

19:16.171 --> 19:18.364
Yeah, bro. This is Beckett
we're talking about.

19:18.399 --> 19:19.632
It's a girls' night out.

19:19.666 --> 19:21.663
It won't be a competition.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.749
Not bad.

19:34.988 --> 19:37.483
Thanks.
I'm, uh, a little rusty, though.

19:37.517 --> 19:38.350
Me too.

19:38.384 --> 19:40.816
I haven't been to a range
in six months.

19:44.758 --> 19:46.826
That's after six months?

19:46.860 --> 19:48.227
It's hard to find time
to practice

19:48.261 --> 19:51.497
with my duties in Hong Kong,
San Fran, the Hague.

19:51.531 --> 19:53.281
Wait a minute.
You work at the Hague?

19:53.301 --> 19:55.609
With the International
War Crimes Tribunal.

19:56.302 --> 19:58.637
Trust me, it's not
as glamorous as it sounds.

19:59.772 --> 20:01.507
But when you reach
the peak of a mountain,

20:01.541 --> 20:03.605
it's time to scale
another one, right?

20:03.625 --> 20:05.375
[Chuckling] Yeah.

20:05.395 --> 20:09.781
So, uh, team leader,
a wife, a mom...

20:09.815 --> 20:12.191
isn't it a struggle
to do it all?

20:12.211 --> 20:15.152
The trick is to not struggle,
but to find balance.

20:15.363 --> 20:16.688
The moment you think
it's a struggle,

20:16.722 --> 20:18.713
that's when you fall.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.893
You know, there's one thing
that doesn't add up, though,

20:22.927 --> 20:24.428
I mean, given who you are...

20:24.463 --> 20:25.363
How Henry and I know each other...

20:25.397 --> 20:27.398
because we come from
such different worlds.

20:27.432 --> 20:28.166
Exactly.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.600
My parents worked as house staff

20:29.635 --> 20:31.202
for the Chinese mission
to the U.N.

20:31.236 --> 20:33.459
I ended up in public school,
here in the city.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.306
I didn't speak much English,
got bullied for it.

20:36.326 --> 20:38.758
Henry stood up for me.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.478
I couldn't stop what he became,

20:41.512 --> 20:43.948
but we never stopped
being friends.

20:46.317 --> 20:47.885
Somehow, the fact
that you did this

20:47.919 --> 20:49.553
makes you even more attractive.

20:49.587 --> 20:52.690
Yeah?
Well, tell it to Zhang.

20:53.658 --> 20:54.491
This is <i>her</i> target?

20:54.525 --> 20:56.776
And she has 10 others
just like it.

20:59.129 --> 20:59.962
Oh.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.404
Well, so she's a good shot.
Big deal.

21:02.424 --> 21:04.234
She's good at <i>everything!</i>

21:04.268 --> 21:05.935
She's got an incredible career,

21:05.969 --> 21:07.737
movie-star husband,
perfect kids.

21:07.771 --> 21:09.506
She does it all, she has it all,

21:09.540 --> 21:11.140
and to top it off,
she's gorgeous.

21:11.175 --> 21:12.641
[Sighs] Yeah, she is.

21:12.676 --> 21:14.808
Wait a minute.
<i>You</i> think she's gorgeous?

21:16.098 --> 21:17.613
I...

21:17.647 --> 21:18.948
was just agreeing with you.

21:18.982 --> 21:22.042
Okay, but did you think it
before I said it?

21:23.353 --> 21:24.486
No...?

21:27.357 --> 21:30.422
Oh, my God. Castle, I haven't felt
like this since I had pimples.

21:32.097 --> 21:33.495
I'm insecure.

21:33.787 --> 21:35.090
[Elevator bell dings]
You're not insecure.

21:35.110 --> 21:36.373
Wait... if I'm not insecure,

21:36.393 --> 21:37.799
then why'd you say
what you just said?

21:37.834 --> 21:39.635
Ah... okay, look,
you're doing it again.

21:39.669 --> 21:40.769
It's Patterson syndrome.

21:40.803 --> 21:42.771
I knew it was a bad idea
for you to go out with her.

21:42.805 --> 21:45.340
No, no. Castle, I just wanted
to see what made Zhang tick...

21:45.374 --> 21:47.008
you know,
how she achieved what she did,

21:47.043 --> 21:48.710
so maybe that
could help me move forward.

21:48.745 --> 21:51.476
Kate, you don't need her help.
You're doing just fine.

21:51.496 --> 21:53.715
Yeah, but when you reach
the peak of one mountain,

21:53.750 --> 21:55.556
isn't it time
to scale another one?

21:55.576 --> 21:57.119
That sounds like
something Zhang would say.

21:57.153 --> 21:59.187
- Are you quoting her?
- No.

21:59.696 --> 22:02.123
Look, you're idealizing Zhang.

22:02.157 --> 22:03.491
You're comparing yourself

22:03.525 --> 22:05.826
to a version of her
that doesn't even exist.

22:05.861 --> 22:08.329
She is a human, like
the rest of us, flaws and all,

22:08.364 --> 22:09.797
not some infallible supercop

22:09.831 --> 22:11.544
who swoops in every time
to save the day.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.969
Hey. Zhang just got a lead
that could crack this case.

22:16.872 --> 22:18.971
You were saying?

22:21.542 --> 22:23.210
Zhang: I was scanning
surveillance video

22:23.245 --> 22:24.344
of Henry's apartment complex,

22:24.379 --> 22:26.747
trying to piece together
the timeline on the day he died,

22:26.782 --> 22:28.249
when I saw this.

22:28.283 --> 22:29.850
That's Henry.

22:29.885 --> 22:32.319
Note the time... 2:37 p.m.

22:32.353 --> 22:34.921
Meaning after Henry left the
repo yard, he went back home.

22:34.955 --> 22:36.555
Except he didn't stay.

22:36.590 --> 22:39.926
Five minutes later,
he left his apartment complex.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.560
Watch what happens next.

22:41.595 --> 22:42.796
[Computer beeps]

22:47.701 --> 22:48.701
[Computer beeps]

22:48.735 --> 22:51.938
Before he was killed,
Henry Graham was kidnapped.

22:55.301 --> 22:57.623
Esposito: Tech was able
to pull the numbers off the license plate.

22:57.643 --> 23:01.059
The S.U.V. Is registered
to a William "Billy" Hicks.

23:01.079 --> 23:03.868
According to my buddies at
narcotics, this guy's hard-core.

23:03.888 --> 23:06.391
Every year, he makes their
"top 20" list for drug dealers.

23:06.411 --> 23:08.379
But they've never
been able to nail him...

23:08.413 --> 23:11.190
mostly because he has
other guys do his dirty work.

23:11.210 --> 23:12.448
Zhang: I know this man.

23:12.483 --> 23:14.817
Billy Hicks started Henry
on a life of crime,

23:14.852 --> 23:16.386
hired him as an enforcer.

23:16.420 --> 23:18.411
He's the reason
that Henry went to prison.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.856
Well, then he's probably
the reason Henry was murdered.

23:21.154 --> 23:23.960
But Henry hasn't worked for
Hicks in... in almost 10 years.

23:23.995 --> 23:26.339
Why would Hicks
come after him now?

23:27.841 --> 23:29.365
Beckett:
Maybe Henry knew too much...

23:29.400 --> 23:30.800
about Hicks
and the organization.

23:30.834 --> 23:33.996
That's probably why Glassman
approached him at the Jade Temple...

23:34.016 --> 23:36.406
the FBI is building a case
against Hicks.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.875
And Glassman
wanted Henry to roll.

23:38.909 --> 23:40.342
You know, if Henry refused,

23:40.377 --> 23:42.244
that explains why
Glassman and he fought.

23:42.279 --> 23:43.879
It doesn't matter if he refused.

23:43.914 --> 23:46.288
If a man like Hicks thought
Henry was talking to the FBI,

23:46.308 --> 23:48.918
he would stop at nothing
to protect his empire

23:48.952 --> 23:50.470
and eliminate the threat.

23:51.016 --> 23:52.087
Where do we find Hicks?

23:52.122 --> 23:53.889
He operates out of a gym he owns
in queens...

23:53.924 --> 23:54.990
O'Donnell's boxing.

23:55.025 --> 23:56.058
All right. Let's go.

23:56.092 --> 23:57.822
Detective, wait!

23:57.842 --> 23:59.964
I need a word with you.

24:05.635 --> 24:07.746
You can't go after Hicks.

24:08.438 --> 24:09.761
W-why not?

24:09.781 --> 24:11.908
Orders straight from 1PP.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.008
[Sighs] Did they say why?

24:14.043 --> 24:15.744
Just that it's a federal matter.

24:17.572 --> 24:20.448
So I'm right... Hicks <i>is</i> being
investigated by the feds.

24:20.482 --> 24:23.422
And they don't want us
screwing up their case.

24:23.442 --> 24:25.619
Sir, he could be our killer.

24:25.654 --> 24:27.455
They are aware of that.
They need us to wait.

24:27.489 --> 24:30.407
- For how long?
- Until indictments come down.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.827
And when exactly do they
expect these indictments...

24:32.847 --> 24:34.462
days, weeks, months?

24:34.496 --> 24:36.096
We don't know, but until then,

24:36.130 --> 24:38.532
we've been ordered to stand down
from this investigation.

24:38.567 --> 24:39.533
What are you saying...

24:39.568 --> 24:41.535
that my friend is dead
and I can do nothing?

24:41.570 --> 24:44.738
Is that what you're telling me,
Detective Beckett?

24:44.773 --> 24:47.508
Where is the justice in that?

24:51.245 --> 24:52.950
She's not wrong.

24:54.248 --> 24:57.084
Look, even though
we can't approach Hicks,

24:57.118 --> 24:59.958
we can build a case,
gather evidence against him.

24:59.978 --> 25:01.855
We'll start
by combing street cams...

25:01.889 --> 25:04.264
see if we can find out where that S.U.V.
went after Henry was taken.

25:04.284 --> 25:06.960
I'll send a team to the crime
scene to canvass the park,

25:06.994 --> 25:08.324
see if anyone remembers
seeing that S.U.V.

25:08.344 --> 25:09.801
You know,
we should talk to Zhang,

25:09.821 --> 25:12.221
see what else she knows
about Henry and Hicks.

25:16.713 --> 25:18.295
Zhang?

25:27.180 --> 25:29.482
You guys, did Zhang
circle back through here?

25:29.516 --> 25:31.003
No. She stormed off that
way, didn't she?

25:31.127 --> 25:32.651
- Yeah.
- Oh. You don't think...

25:32.685 --> 25:34.487
yeah, I do...
O'Donnell's boxing gym.

25:34.521 --> 25:37.123
- She's going after Hicks.
- I-I'll get her.

25:37.157 --> 25:39.391
She's my responsibility.

for the pilates studio,

26:15.260 --> 26:16.193
it's across the street.

26:16.227 --> 26:18.328
I'm looking for your boss.
There... Hicks.

26:18.363 --> 26:19.664
Step aside, Tony.

26:19.698 --> 26:22.033
Make a lady feel welcome here.

26:22.067 --> 26:25.134
Especially someone as...

26:25.671 --> 26:27.902
as lovely
as this delicate flower.

26:28.063 --> 26:30.040
What could I do you for,
Miss...?

26:30.075 --> 26:31.241
Zhang.

26:31.276 --> 26:33.310
I'd like to discuss
a mutual friend...

26:33.344 --> 26:34.878
Henry Graham.

26:35.672 --> 26:37.559
Sorry. I don't know that name.

26:37.579 --> 26:39.482
Oh, I think you do.

26:41.406 --> 26:42.819
You don't want to do that.

26:42.853 --> 26:43.920
You might get hurt.

26:43.955 --> 26:46.638
Funny. I was gonna say
the same thing to <i>him.</i>

26:53.517 --> 26:55.403

27:37.500 --> 27:38.666

- Now arrest this crazy bitch.
- Right after I arrest <i>you.</i>

27:56.184 --> 27:57.552
For what?

27:57.586 --> 27:59.887
We have a video
of you abducting Henry Graham

27:59.921 --> 28:01.526
outside of his apartment.

28:01.546 --> 28:02.689
Abduct?

28:02.724 --> 28:05.192
- We gave him a ride.
- By forcing him into your S.U.V.?

28:05.227 --> 28:07.011
Come on, that was a gag.

28:07.031 --> 28:09.414
Okay, my boys were just...
messing with him.

28:09.434 --> 28:10.831
We do that stuff all the time.
Ask Henry.

28:10.865 --> 28:13.740
That's gonna be hard,
seeing as you killed him.

28:15.577 --> 28:16.892
Wait.

28:17.165 --> 28:18.617
Henry's dead?

28:19.440 --> 28:22.141
Okay, I had
nothing to do with that.

28:22.161 --> 28:25.078
- All I did was help him.
- Help him with what?

28:26.616 --> 28:28.035
You don't want to talk to me?

28:28.055 --> 28:29.917
Fine. You can talk to <i>her.</i>

28:29.951 --> 28:31.617
Okay, look.

28:31.652 --> 28:33.219
[Panting]

28:33.254 --> 28:35.455
He came to me last week
needing a favor.

28:35.489 --> 28:37.463
What kind of a favor?

28:38.259 --> 28:40.126
Let's just say
he wanted something.

28:40.161 --> 28:41.996
What did he want?!

28:42.829 --> 28:43.930
Hypothetically?

28:43.964 --> 28:45.465
Yeah. Fine. Hypothetically.

28:45.499 --> 28:48.568
Let's say... and this
is just an example...

28:48.602 --> 28:51.236
that he wanted
half a kilo of coke.

28:53.068 --> 28:55.450
Why would Henry need cocaine?

28:56.654 --> 28:59.885
Let's just assume,
in this particular example,

28:59.905 --> 29:01.547
that he said
he was trying to help a friend

29:01.582 --> 29:03.049
get out of a bad situation.

29:03.083 --> 29:04.318
Who was the friend,

29:04.338 --> 29:06.348
and what were they gonna do
with the coke?

29:06.368 --> 29:07.719
Maybe he didn't say,
and I didn't ask.

29:07.753 --> 29:09.888
Maybe I told him he shouldn't
get back in the game.

29:09.922 --> 29:10.822
It's too dangerous.

29:10.856 --> 29:12.924
But he said it was
just a one-time deal.

29:12.944 --> 29:13.788
You're lying!

29:13.808 --> 29:15.327
- Henry would never sell drugs!
- Wait! Zhang! Zhang!

29:15.361 --> 29:17.062
Maybe we're talking
about different Henrys,

29:17.097 --> 29:18.597
because the one in my example

29:18.631 --> 29:21.105
asked for it to be divided
into smaller eight-balls.

29:22.172 --> 29:26.178
Look, detective, Henry
served me well back in the day.

29:26.637 --> 29:28.975
When the shipment was ready,

29:28.995 --> 29:31.275
I had him picked up,
not abducted.

29:31.310 --> 29:32.611
I gave him the coke he needed.

29:32.645 --> 29:33.678
He was so grateful,

29:33.713 --> 29:36.416
he even told me about
the feds watching my place,

29:36.436 --> 29:38.501
how they saw him
leave here last week,

29:38.521 --> 29:40.985
and they tried
to get him to roll on me.

29:41.019 --> 29:42.286
[Chuckles nervously]

29:42.882 --> 29:45.018
Hypothetically, of course.

29:45.663 --> 29:47.992
And that was the last
I've heard of him.

29:48.026 --> 29:50.628
Let's just say
that you're telling the truth.

29:50.662 --> 29:53.297
Did he tell you where
he was going with the drugs?

29:53.332 --> 29:54.264
No.

29:54.298 --> 29:56.433
But when my boys
took him back to the city,

29:56.467 --> 29:57.668
he didn't go home.

29:57.702 --> 29:59.737
He wanted out on 53rd and 1st.

30:03.031 --> 30:05.542
Yeah, Ryan. Look, Hicks could be
lying about everything.

30:05.576 --> 30:07.177
We still got to send a patrol

30:07.211 --> 30:09.279
to canvass 53rd and 1st,
just in case.

30:09.313 --> 30:10.014
Yeah.

30:10.048 --> 30:11.948
Look for witnesses. Thanks.

30:11.982 --> 30:14.665
They should also pull
traffic-camera footage of the area.

30:14.685 --> 30:17.221
That is not your call...
not anymore.

30:17.241 --> 30:18.888
What the hell were you thinking?

30:18.922 --> 30:20.390
I did what I had to!

30:20.424 --> 30:24.006
Without any regard for the feds,
for the NYPD, for me.

30:24.528 --> 30:26.496
Is that what you call
being balanced?

30:26.531 --> 30:30.033
[Laughing] Okay, you want
to know about being balanced?

30:30.067 --> 30:31.868
My husband and I are separated!

30:31.902 --> 30:33.970
I am not the mother I should be!

30:34.004 --> 30:37.339
You think I'm this amazing cop,
that I have it all together,

30:37.374 --> 30:39.042
but I don't!

30:39.076 --> 30:41.526
I'm the reason
that Henry's dead!

30:43.080 --> 30:44.819
What... what
are you talking about?

30:44.839 --> 30:46.215
He called the other week.

30:46.249 --> 30:48.376
He left a message saying that...

30:49.786 --> 30:51.462
he needed my help.

30:52.033 --> 30:53.021
I didn't think it was important,

30:53.056 --> 30:54.256
so I didn't call him back
right away,

30:54.291 --> 30:55.691
and when I did, it was too late.

30:55.725 --> 30:58.039
He told me
no one could help him anymore.

30:59.196 --> 31:01.063
That's why
you hopped on that plane?

31:01.097 --> 31:03.932
[Voice breaking] Growing up,
Henry was always there for me,

31:03.966 --> 31:05.631
protecting me.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.341
And when he needed me,
I was too busy.

31:09.361 --> 31:11.073
I am always too busy

31:11.107 --> 31:13.225
for everything
that really matters.

31:15.384 --> 31:18.846
That's why I need to do this...
not just for Henry, for <i>me.</i>

31:18.880 --> 31:21.349
[Cellphone ringing]

31:23.752 --> 31:25.581
[Sighing] Gates.

31:25.743 --> 31:27.455
Who is it?

31:29.258 --> 31:31.892
[Ringing continues]

31:34.602 --> 31:37.198
- Zhang: This is all my fault.
- It sure is.

31:37.232 --> 31:39.200
I'm going in. She shouldn't
take the blame for it.

31:39.234 --> 31:40.134
Unh.

31:40.168 --> 31:42.937
She wouldn't take it
if she didn't want to.

31:42.971 --> 31:45.405
Believe me,
Beckett has plenty of experience

31:45.440 --> 31:48.075
taking a bullet for other people
doing stupid things.

31:48.110 --> 31:49.923
Hell, she's married to <i>me.</i>

31:50.270 --> 31:53.580
But, uh, you supercops
need to stick together, right?

31:53.615 --> 31:55.081
[Door closes]

31:56.769 --> 31:58.084
What happened?

31:58.119 --> 31:59.653
Uh, I told her that you left

31:59.687 --> 32:01.421
before you knew
Hicks was off-limits.

32:01.456 --> 32:03.085
Did she believe you?

32:03.105 --> 32:05.759
She <i>chose</i> to believe me.

32:06.799 --> 32:08.494
Thank you, detective.

32:08.821 --> 32:10.964
Well, the best way to thank me

32:10.998 --> 32:13.239
is to help us solve the case.

32:13.259 --> 32:15.601
Hey. So, we got a hit
off that canvass.

32:15.636 --> 32:17.303
Unis... they found
a street vendor

32:17.337 --> 32:19.405
who works near the corner
of 53rd and 1st

32:19.439 --> 32:22.142
who saw Henry loitering around
a residential parking garage

32:22.176 --> 32:23.301
the day of the murder.

32:23.321 --> 32:25.177
Esposito: Seeing that
Henry was a repo man,

32:25.211 --> 32:26.612
we contacted
the building manager

32:26.647 --> 32:28.013
to get a list of all
the vehicles that park there.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.150
And one of them was a 2013 X5.

32:31.184 --> 32:32.685
Those alarm codes
that Henry requested.

32:32.719 --> 32:35.354
- Who owns the car?
- This guy... Jeffrey Wadlow.

32:35.389 --> 32:37.156
He's a wealthy businessman
in property development

32:37.190 --> 32:38.624
with a history of drug charges.

32:38.659 --> 32:41.426
That his high-powered attorneys
always got dismissed.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.594
Until the other day,

32:42.628 --> 32:44.997
because after receiving
an anonymous tip to the police

32:45.031 --> 32:47.199
that Wadlow was selling drugs,
they pulled him over

32:47.233 --> 32:49.334
and found half a kilo of cocaine

32:49.368 --> 32:51.996
separated out into eight-balls
stashed inside the car.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.673
That means
Henry wasn't selling drugs.

32:54.707 --> 32:55.774
He was <i>planting</i> them.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.336
Yeah, but why?

32:57.356 --> 32:59.611
Is there a connection
between Henry and Wadlow?

32:59.645 --> 33:01.145
Not that we could find.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.314
Where's Wadlow now?

33:02.348 --> 33:03.415
Central booking,

33:03.449 --> 33:05.770
waiting arraignment
for felony distribution charges.

33:06.719 --> 33:07.985
Who the hell is Henry Graham?

33:08.020 --> 33:08.953
Beckett: Come on, Mr. Wadlow.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.022
I've got detectives
digging into your life

33:11.056 --> 33:13.124
looking for ties
between the two of you.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.725
And it's going to be
worse for you

33:14.759 --> 33:17.228
if you say you don't know Henry
and we find out you do.

33:17.262 --> 33:18.830
But I don't know him.

33:18.864 --> 33:21.096
So why would he
plant drugs in your car?

33:21.654 --> 33:23.500
Yes!

33:23.535 --> 33:25.169
I told the cops
they were planted.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.538
Finally,
someone who believes me!

33:27.572 --> 33:29.640
Hey, hey,
if you know it was this guy,

33:29.674 --> 33:31.174
then I can get out of here,
right?

33:31.209 --> 33:33.076
Not when you reached out
and hired someone

33:33.110 --> 33:34.311
to murder Henry.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.846
Murder?!

33:35.880 --> 33:38.415
I-I would never
have someone killed,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.851
I-I... especially someone
I've never even seen before.

33:40.885 --> 33:41.719
If you don't know Henry,

33:41.753 --> 33:43.220
then why would he
try to frame you?

33:43.254 --> 33:44.722
I have no idea.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.356
Maybe somebody put him up to it.

33:46.390 --> 33:47.991
- Like who?
- I don't know.

33:48.025 --> 33:50.093
[Sighs] Maybe somebody who...

33:50.127 --> 33:52.095
somebody who doesn't like
the way I do business...

33:52.129 --> 33:53.230
a competitor, maybe.

33:53.264 --> 33:57.000
Who stands to gain by you
going to prison, Mr. Wadlow?

33:57.510 --> 33:59.496
A whole lot of people.

34:03.206 --> 34:05.107
Wadlow's in the clear
for the murder.

34:05.141 --> 34:07.109
He was locked up
at the time of the death.

34:07.143 --> 34:09.779
Could he have ordered Henry's
execution while detained?

34:09.813 --> 34:11.614
Uh, he made one phone call...
to his lawyer.

34:11.648 --> 34:13.282
And he didn't
manage to get through

34:13.315 --> 34:14.449
until Henry was already dead.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.270
Yo, Beckett,
we were combing through

34:16.290 --> 34:17.887
Wadlow's business dealings,
and we came across something

34:17.920 --> 34:19.788
that might be connected
to our case.

34:19.822 --> 34:21.257
Over the past six months,

34:21.291 --> 34:22.925
Wadlow's been
buying up real estate

34:22.958 --> 34:25.581
for his next new development
in Chinatown,

34:25.601 --> 34:27.228
and each time he did,

34:27.264 --> 34:29.098
he outbid
the same rival company.

34:29.132 --> 34:31.900
VCN Holdings...
and the woman who runs VCN

34:31.935 --> 34:33.601
also happens to own
a little restaurant

34:33.636 --> 34:35.103
called the Jade Temple.

34:35.137 --> 34:36.737
Mimi Tan is behind this?

34:36.773 --> 34:38.873
That's right... it's one of
dozens of businesses she owns,

34:38.908 --> 34:40.308
and not all of them
are on the up-and-up.

34:40.342 --> 34:42.141
Organized crime tells us

34:42.176 --> 34:43.944
that Mimi Tan's rumored to be
linked to human trafficking.

34:43.978 --> 34:46.280
She staffs her businesses
with illegals

34:46.313 --> 34:48.916
that she smuggles from China
via a network of triads.

34:48.949 --> 34:50.618
But now
she's looking to go legit,

34:50.652 --> 34:52.119
and shes sees
the Chinatown development

34:52.152 --> 34:53.286
as her ticket to respectability.

34:53.321 --> 34:55.121
So the fact
that Henry was eating

34:55.156 --> 34:57.123
at her restaurant every day
is not a coincidence.

34:57.158 --> 34:58.954
Mimi must have persuaded
her "number-one customer"

34:58.974 --> 35:01.212
to plant those drugs on Wadlow
to eliminate the competition.

35:01.232 --> 35:03.473
And then,
once Henry completed his task,

35:03.497 --> 35:04.631
Mimi had <i>him</i> eliminated.

35:04.665 --> 35:06.033
Only, how do we prove it?

35:06.067 --> 35:08.102
We're gonna need
something stronger

35:08.136 --> 35:10.037
than just the lunch special.

35:10.071 --> 35:11.805
Well, ask and ye shall receive.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.241
Do you remember
that phenol-formaldehyde resin

35:14.275 --> 35:16.409
that the lab found
on the bottom of Henry's shoes?

35:16.444 --> 35:19.379
Well, it might have
come from a garment factory

35:19.413 --> 35:21.481
a few blocks away from the park
where Henry was shot.

35:21.515 --> 35:22.415
What makes you say that?

35:22.450 --> 35:25.811
Because that factory is owned
by Mimi Tan.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.312
Hello again.

35:37.332 --> 35:39.322
Joining us for dinner
this time, I hope?

35:39.356 --> 35:41.458
Uh, no, not tonight.
Actually, we were hoping

35:41.492 --> 35:42.933
that you could
help us a little more

35:42.953 --> 35:45.328
with Henry's
murder investigation.

35:45.362 --> 35:47.837
Of course...
whatever I can do to help.

35:47.857 --> 35:50.318
Jeffrey Wadlow...
do you know him?

35:50.338 --> 35:51.634
He's a local developer.

35:51.668 --> 35:54.811
I know <i>of</i> him...
very unscrupulous.

35:54.831 --> 35:55.981
Zhang: Perhaps so.

35:56.001 --> 35:58.040
He was arrested
for drug charges the other day.

35:58.075 --> 35:59.509
How unfortunate for him.

35:59.543 --> 36:01.443
Oh, and how fortunate for <i>you.</i>

36:01.478 --> 36:02.411
Wadlow goes to prison,

36:02.445 --> 36:04.814
all his recent real-estate deals
fall apart.

36:04.848 --> 36:07.016
Making room
for your company to swoop in

36:07.050 --> 36:09.151
and buy
numerous Chinatown properties.

36:09.185 --> 36:11.353
And what does this have to do
with Henry's death?

36:11.387 --> 36:14.289
You enlisted Henry to plant
those drugs in Wadlow's car

36:14.324 --> 36:15.958
to get rid of your competition.

36:15.993 --> 36:17.692
- That's absurd.
- Is it?

36:17.727 --> 36:19.461
We found
phenol-formaldehyde resin

36:19.496 --> 36:20.496
under Henry's shoe...

36:20.530 --> 36:23.365
the same kind that's used
at your garment factory

36:23.399 --> 36:24.699
near the crime scene.

36:24.734 --> 36:26.135
We talked
to several of your workers

36:26.169 --> 36:28.137
who saw you with Henry
at the factory

36:28.171 --> 36:29.812
the night he was murdered.

36:29.832 --> 36:31.507
I want to talk to my lawyer now.

36:31.541 --> 36:32.716
Why did you do it?

36:32.736 --> 36:34.375
To tie up loose ends?
Is that it?

36:34.409 --> 36:36.687
I'm not saying
another word until...

36:36.707 --> 36:39.180
- It was you! You killed him!
- Aah!

36:39.214 --> 36:41.816
Wait! Hey!
[Shouting in mandarin]

36:41.851 --> 36:44.485
[Speaking mandarin]

36:44.520 --> 36:46.554
[Crying]

36:46.588 --> 36:48.476
Henry didn't come here
for the food.

36:48.496 --> 36:49.557
He came here for <i>you.</i>

36:49.591 --> 36:52.860
He was going to take me away...
free me!

36:52.894 --> 36:54.562
And you kill him!

36:54.596 --> 36:56.497
I did not kill Henry.

36:56.532 --> 36:57.765
You lie!

36:57.799 --> 37:00.834
What do you mean,
he came here to free you?

37:00.869 --> 37:02.069
I owe much money

37:02.103 --> 37:04.738
to the smugglers
who bring me here.

37:04.773 --> 37:06.106
[Voice breaking]
She buy my debt.

37:06.141 --> 37:09.676
I work here
to pay it off for years.

37:10.359 --> 37:12.059
That's not true.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.014
And then you met Henry.

37:14.049 --> 37:16.449
He want us
to start a life together.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.941
He went to Mimi
to pay my debt...

37:18.961 --> 37:21.521
[sobbing] $40,000.

37:22.791 --> 37:24.558
And Henry didn't have
that kind of cash,

37:24.592 --> 37:26.092
so you made
a different agreement

37:26.126 --> 37:27.360
for Suyin's release.

37:27.395 --> 37:30.759
You had Henry frame Wadlow
for her freedom.

37:32.608 --> 37:34.816
He did that for me?

37:37.471 --> 37:38.782
That's why he say

37:38.802 --> 37:41.222
for me to meet him
at the park that night.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.951
[Sobbing] He say
he would have good news.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.192
W-w-w-wait.

37:44.212 --> 37:47.290
So <i>you</i> were the one
he was waiting for at the park?

37:47.538 --> 37:48.380
No.

37:48.415 --> 37:52.118
I was supposed to,
but Henry phone me.

37:52.152 --> 37:54.240
He say not to come.

37:56.027 --> 37:56.888
He canceled?

37:56.923 --> 37:58.390
Did he tell you why?

37:58.790 --> 38:01.126
I did not speak to him.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.630
He call here and left a message.

38:05.268 --> 38:07.998
Suyin, who gave you
that message?

38:12.023 --> 38:13.393
Beckett: Thanks, Mei Wu.

38:13.413 --> 38:15.073
We just need
to clear up a few details.

38:15.108 --> 38:16.441
This shouldn't take too long.

38:16.475 --> 38:17.675
Of course.

38:17.710 --> 38:19.577
Henry was a good man.

38:19.612 --> 38:21.446
Yes. He was.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.380
So, Suyin told us

38:22.414 --> 38:23.982
that you were working
at the restaurant

38:24.016 --> 38:25.551
the night that Henry was killed.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.065
She said that you gave her
a message.

38:27.085 --> 38:28.822
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

38:30.689 --> 38:32.590
I'm sorry.
Did I do something wrong?

38:32.625 --> 38:33.691
Castle: I'll say so.

38:33.726 --> 38:34.819
You lied to her,

38:34.839 --> 38:36.628
just like you're lying to us
right now.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.463
We checked
Henry's phone records.

38:38.497 --> 38:40.572
He never called the restaurant.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.601
He must have used
a different phone.

38:43.636 --> 38:44.969
I did speak with him.

38:45.003 --> 38:46.303
Yeah, of course you did...

38:46.337 --> 38:48.038
when you confronted him
at the park.

38:48.073 --> 38:49.373
What... park?

38:49.407 --> 38:50.808
Your Metro card shows

38:50.842 --> 38:53.010
that you entered
the subway across the street

38:53.044 --> 38:55.279
during Henry's
time-of-death window.

38:55.313 --> 38:58.251
Suyin told us
about your friendship...

38:58.271 --> 39:00.450
how you grew up together,

39:00.485 --> 39:03.481
how you both came here,
how hard it was.

39:03.501 --> 39:06.456
How you both
owe a debt to Mimi Tan.

39:06.491 --> 39:08.525
Castle: But that was
all about to change.

39:08.559 --> 39:10.894
You realized Henry
was gonna clear Suyin's debt

39:10.928 --> 39:12.696
and take her away from you.

39:12.730 --> 39:14.631
And you could not
allow that to happen.

39:14.666 --> 39:16.633
Please.

39:16.668 --> 39:18.134
I did nothing wrong.

39:18.169 --> 39:19.836
CSU recovered blood micro-spray

39:19.870 --> 39:21.570
on clothes
found in your apartment.

39:21.605 --> 39:23.173
That blood matches Henry's.

39:23.207 --> 39:25.308
No, no. This is a mistake.

39:25.342 --> 39:27.310
[Shouting in mandarin]

39:35.552 --> 39:38.253
[Crying]
Suyin is all I have here,

39:38.288 --> 39:40.556
and she was going to leave me!

39:40.590 --> 39:42.558
I had to do something!

39:42.592 --> 39:44.694
I had to!

39:44.728 --> 39:47.095
Mei Wu, you're under arrest

39:47.130 --> 39:48.597
for the murder of Henry Graham.

39:48.632 --> 39:51.334
[Handcuffs click]

39:53.436 --> 39:55.204
[Door opens]

40:04.914 --> 40:06.614
How's Suyin doing?

40:06.649 --> 40:07.682
She's strong.

40:07.717 --> 40:09.083
She'll be all right.

40:09.117 --> 40:11.949
So, um, a bit of good news.

40:12.396 --> 40:13.822
I-I spoke with immigration,

40:13.856 --> 40:17.726
and in exchange for Suyin
testifying against Mimi Tan,

40:17.760 --> 40:20.528
they are going to
grant her asylum.

40:20.563 --> 40:22.397
She's gonna be allowed
to stay in the U.S...

40:22.431 --> 40:24.109
but free this time.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.667
Just as Henry wanted.

40:27.769 --> 40:30.057
So, what are you gonna do now?

40:30.739 --> 40:31.948
I don't know.

40:31.968 --> 40:34.909
Pick up where I left off.
Pick up the pieces.

40:34.943 --> 40:37.044
Try to find my balance.

40:37.079 --> 40:38.302
[Chuckles]

40:38.322 --> 40:40.270
It's easier said than done.

40:42.194 --> 40:44.552
Good luck, Inspector.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.021
Thank you, Kate.

40:49.123 --> 40:50.896
For everything.

41:00.603 --> 41:04.804
So, you think you and Zhang
will stay in touch?

41:04.838 --> 41:05.772
I hope so.

41:05.806 --> 41:09.089
I mean, us supercops
need to stick together.

41:09.109 --> 41:11.177
You're not trying to break my high
score on fruit ninja, are you?

41:11.212 --> 41:13.917
No, I'm writing up a list
of priorities for my future.

41:13.937 --> 41:16.916
Ah. New mountains to climb.

41:17.826 --> 41:22.622
Well, what's it gonna be...
Fuji, Kilimanjaro, Everest?

41:23.547 --> 41:25.024
I don't know yet.

41:25.058 --> 41:26.025
I mean, I love what I do,

41:26.059 --> 41:28.360
but I feel like I have to find
a new challenge.

41:28.395 --> 41:30.930
It was kind of like when you killed off
Derrick Storm 'cause you were bored.

41:30.964 --> 41:33.032
Ah, yeah.
Look how that turned out.

41:33.066 --> 41:35.200
[Smooches]
Mm. Yeah.

41:35.235 --> 41:36.936
[Grunts]
Well, whatever is next,

41:36.970 --> 41:39.371
I don't want to have to
compromise my priorities

41:39.406 --> 41:42.841
to get there,
and I never want to be guilty

41:42.875 --> 41:44.643
of leaving behind
what matters most.

41:44.677 --> 41:47.733
You cannot leave behind
what is always at your side.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.316
- Did you just make that up?
- Yeah. Why?

41:53.446 --> 41:56.454
You're so much better
than Patterson.

41:59.603 --> 42:02.817
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

42:03.139 --> 42:05.068
Did you notice anything or anyone

42:05.088 --> 42:06.676
suspicious prior the shooting?

42:08.575 --> 42:10.565
Shots rang out
[gun shot]

42:10.585 --> 42:12.845
- Three of them.
- I dove.

42:12.865 --> 42:14.099
Then, I spotted the shooter.

42:14.119 --> 42:16.717
Did you see his face? Can you
describe him?

42:16.737 --> 42:18.010
Stay right where you are!

42:18.030 --> 42:20.666
NYPD! Stop that man!

42:21.534 --> 42:24.379
Police! Get out of the way! Move
out of the way!

42:24.885 --> 42:28.841
Freeze! Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!
Put the gun down now or I'll shoot!
