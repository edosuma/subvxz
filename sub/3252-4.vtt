00:15.235 --> 00:16.251
Listen!

00:17.812 --> 00:18.968
Question!

00:19.409 --> 00:22.416
Why do we talk out loud

00:22.417 --> 00:23.421
when we know...

00:27.414 --> 00:29.334
..we're alone?

00:31.397 --> 00:32.412
Conjecture...

00:34.398 --> 00:36.350
..because we know we're not.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.418
Evolution perfects survival skills.

00:47.354 --> 00:49.330
There are perfect hunters.

00:58.334 --> 01:00.346
There is perfect defence.

01:05.402 --> 01:07.345
Question -

01:07.346 --> 01:10.398
why is there no such
thing as perfect hiding?

01:12.418 --> 01:15.409
Answer! How would you know?

01:15.410 --> 01:19.373
Logically, if evolution were
to perfect a creature

01:19.374 --> 01:22.381
whose primary skill were
to hide from view -

01:22.382 --> 01:24.357
how could you know it existed?

01:24.358 --> 01:27.333
It could be with us every second
and we would never know.

01:27.334 --> 01:29.337
How would you detect it,

01:29.338 --> 01:30.370
even sense it...

01:34.398 --> 01:38.365
..except in those moments

01:38.366 --> 01:39.526
when, for no clear reason...

01:41.378 --> 01:43.342
..you choose to speak aloud?

01:45.354 --> 01:47.390
What would such a creature want?

01:49.370 --> 01:50.426
What would it do?

01:52.394 --> 01:54.393
Well?

01:54.394 --> 01:55.935
What would you do?

02:17.966 --> 02:54.045

03:17.370 --> 03:18.373
Hey. Hey.

03:18.374 --> 03:19.378
Sorry.

03:23.386 --> 03:25.401
So the famous drink at last.

03:25.402 --> 03:30.341
Yeah. Took a bit of time -
family stuff but here we are.

03:30.342 --> 03:31.377
Dinner, in fact.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.385
Yeah, straight to dinner.

03:33.386 --> 03:35.365
I like a man who moves fast.

03:35.366 --> 03:37.426
Yeah! I might go
straight for extras.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.401
Afters. Dessert.

03:43.402 --> 03:47.334
Yes, I know, I know, dessert.
Straight to dessert. Gotcha.

03:51.346 --> 03:54.421
So, erm... how was your day?

03:54.422 --> 03:58.349
Good. You know... teaching.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.381
Yep, teaching. Teaching, teaching.

04:00.382 --> 04:01.401
Totally teaching.

04:01.402 --> 04:04.358
We probably shouldn't talk about
work. God, yeah!

04:08.398 --> 04:11.330
Though,
do you take Courtney for anything?

04:15.350 --> 04:17.404
Ser... are you serious?

04:17.406 --> 04:20.373
She said she couldn't concentrate
on her work,

04:20.374 --> 04:24.365
because my face was too wide.

04:24.366 --> 04:26.421
Wide?
I could kill that girl some days.

04:26.422 --> 04:30.357
Me too.
And from you, that means something.

04:30.358 --> 04:31.362
Sorry?

04:36.394 --> 04:38.413
I dug 23 wells.

04:38.414 --> 04:39.425
I'm sorry?

04:39.426 --> 04:43.329
23 wells - when I was a soldier. 23!

04:43.330 --> 04:46.357
OK. Good. Good wells.
Yeah, they were good, actually.

04:46.358 --> 04:48.373
I'm not doubting
the quality of your wells.

04:48.374 --> 04:51.333
Whole villages, saved.
Actual towns full of people.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.337
People I didn't shoot.
People I kept safe!

04:53.338 --> 04:56.349
OK. Point taken. Seriously. So why
doesn't that ever get mentioned?

04:56.350 --> 04:58.413
I'm sorry I didn't
mention your 23 wells!

04:58.414 --> 05:00.405
Excuse me. Sorry.

05:00.406 --> 05:03.329
Er, water for the table?

05:03.330 --> 05:05.334
Don't you worry -
he'll probably dig for it!

05:12.350 --> 05:13.393
Sorry.

05:13.394 --> 05:14.401
It's OK.

05:14.402 --> 05:17.409
Sensitive subject.
Yes. Can slightly see that.

05:17.410 --> 05:21.333
Sometimes people like you
get the wrong end of the stick.

05:21.334 --> 05:22.342
People like me?

05:25.410 --> 05:27.385
I wasn't making
assumptions about you.

05:27.386 --> 05:29.373
That really is exactly
what you were doing.

05:29.374 --> 05:32.393
You were making assumptions about
me! I made a joke. A not-funny joke.

05:32.394 --> 05:36.386
Yeah, well, do you know what
I'm making now? A fuss? An exit!

05:52.370 --> 05:55.401
You just have to squeeze through.
Doctor?

05:55.402 --> 05:58.397
Why do you have three mirrors?
Why don't you just turn your head?

05:58.398 --> 06:01.353
What are you doing in here? You said
you had a date - I thought

06:01.354 --> 06:03.714
I'd better hide in the bedroom
in case you brought him home.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.341
Bit early, aren't you?

06:05.342 --> 06:08.385
Did it all go wrong,
or is this good by your standards?

06:08.386 --> 06:11.401
It was a disaster and I am extremely
upset about it, since you didn't ask.

06:11.402 --> 06:15.365
Fine, I need you, for a thing!

06:15.366 --> 06:18.041
I can't!
Oh, of course you can - you're free.

06:18.042 --> 06:19.381
More than usually free, in fact.

06:19.382 --> 06:22.365
It's possible that
I might get a phone call.

06:22.366 --> 06:23.401
From the date guy?

06:23.402 --> 06:26.361
It's too late.
You've taken your make-up off.

06:26.362 --> 06:28.385
No, I haven't.
I'm still wearing my make-up.

06:28.386 --> 06:30.393
Oh, well, you probably
just missed a bit.

06:30.394 --> 06:32.342
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

06:37.178 --> 06:38.401
I haven't actually said yes.

06:38.402 --> 06:40.417
Yes, you know sometimes
when you talk to yourself,

06:40.418 --> 06:43.401
what if you're not? Not what? What
if it's not you you're talking to?

06:43.402 --> 06:47.345
Proposition - what if no-one
is ever really alone,

06:47.346 --> 06:50.349
what if every single living being
has a companion -

06:50.350 --> 06:51.377
a silent passenger,

06:51.378 --> 06:52.393
a shadow?

06:52.394 --> 06:54.421
What if the prickle
on the back of your neck,

06:54.422 --> 06:57.329
is the breath of something
close behind you?

06:57.330 --> 06:58.926
How long have you been
travelling alone?

06:59.422 --> 07:01.342
Perhaps I never have.

07:05.394 --> 07:07.133
It looks like your handwriting.

07:07.134 --> 07:09.381
Well, I couldn't have written it
and forgotten, could I?

07:09.382 --> 07:12.365
Have you met you?
What's all this? Dreams.

07:12.366 --> 07:15.337
Accounts of dreams, by different
people, all through history.

07:15.338 --> 07:17.578
You see, I have a theory.
I'll bet you have. What theory?

07:17.579 --> 07:19.594
I think everybody,
at some point in their lives,

07:19.595 --> 07:22.346
has the exact same nightmare.

07:25.370 --> 07:28.393
You wake up, or you think you do,

07:28.394 --> 07:31.389
and there's someone in the dark,
someone close,

07:31.390 --> 07:33.354
or you think there might be.

07:34.370 --> 07:38.333
So you sit up, turn on the light.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.401
And the room looks different
at night.

07:40.402 --> 07:45.350
It ticks and creaks and breathes.

07:46.390 --> 07:49.329
And you tell yourself
there's nobody there,

07:49.330 --> 07:51.337
nobody watching, nobody listening,

07:51.338 --> 07:53.334
nobody there at all...

07:56.338 --> 07:57.718
..and you very nearly believe it.

07:59.426 --> 08:02.362
You really, really try...

08:04.354 --> 08:05.386
..and then...

08:13.426 --> 08:16.389
There are accounts of that dream
throughout human history,

08:16.390 --> 08:18.393
time and time again, the same dream.

08:18.394 --> 08:21.145
Now, there is a very obvious
question I'm about to ask you.

08:21.146 --> 08:23.386
Do you know what it is? Have you had
that dream? Exactly.

08:23.387 --> 08:25.467
No - that was me asking you,
have you had that dream?

08:25.492 --> 08:27.393
I asked first. No, I did.

08:27.394 --> 08:29.373
You really didn't.

08:29.374 --> 08:33.332
OK, yeah, probably. Yes.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.494
But everyone dreams about something
under the bed! Why?

08:40.333 --> 08:44.361
Just hold on tight. If anything
bites, let it. What is it?

08:44.362 --> 08:47.377
TARDIS telepathic interface. You're
in mental contact with the TARDIS.

08:47.378 --> 08:49.393
So don't think anything rude.
Why not?

08:49.394 --> 08:51.397
It might end up
on all of the screens.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.049
The TARDIS is extrapolating
your entire timeline,

08:54.050 --> 08:56.393
from the moment of your birth,
to the moment of your death.

08:56.394 --> 08:58.393
Which I do not need a preview of.

08:58.394 --> 09:01.345
I'm turning off the safeguards
and navigation -

09:01.346 --> 09:03.354
slaving the TARDIS to you.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.417
Focus on the dream,

09:06.418 --> 09:10.421
focus on the details, picture them,
feel them.

09:10.422 --> 09:13.373
The TARDIS will
track on your subconscious

09:13.374 --> 09:15.365
and extract the relevant
information.

09:15.366 --> 09:18.413
It should be able to home
in on the moment in your timeline

09:18.414 --> 09:20.425
when you first had that dream.

09:20.426 --> 09:22.402
And then... we'll see.

09:25.330 --> 09:26.413
What will we see?

09:26.414 --> 09:28.366
What's under your bed.

09:33.362 --> 09:34.366
Ooh!

09:36.418 --> 09:39.385
OK, now don't get distracted.

09:39.386 --> 09:42.330
Remember, you are flying
a time machine.

09:48.410 --> 09:53.346
No, no. Don't you get... No, Don't!
Don't, don't. Just ignore it.

09:57.370 --> 09:59.354
OK, that's good.

10:00.374 --> 10:03.029
That worked, we're here.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.389
Sorry - I think I got distracted.

10:04.390 --> 10:08.373
No, no, no, no, no -
the date's fine.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.366
Come on! Come on where?

10:11.398 --> 10:12.402
Your childhood!

10:26.386 --> 10:28.386
The West Country Children's Home.

10:31.394 --> 10:35.422
Gloucester - by the ozone level
and the drains, mid-'90s.

10:37.334 --> 10:39.421
You must have been here
when you had the dream.

10:39.422 --> 10:41.405
Never been to
Gloucester in my life

10:41.406 --> 10:43.189
and I've never
lived in a children's home.

10:43.190 --> 10:44.421
You probably just forgotten -

10:44.422 --> 10:47.377
have you seen the size of human
brains, they're hilarious.

10:47.378 --> 10:50.417
Little you must be in here
somewhere, with your little brain.

10:50.418 --> 10:52.389
Isn't it bad if I meet myself?

10:52.390 --> 10:54.393
It is potentially catastrophic.

10:54.394 --> 10:56.369
So why did you bring me out here?

10:56.370 --> 10:58.369
I was still talking,
I needed someone to nod,

10:58.370 --> 11:01.329
probably best for you to wait
in the TARDIS. Doctor...

11:01.330 --> 11:03.365
See you in a minute. TARDIS.

11:03.366 --> 11:04.374
Doctor!

11:06.130 --> 11:08.389
If I had have been distracted,
what would have happened?

11:08.390 --> 11:11.349
We would probably have ended
up in the wrong place.

11:11.350 --> 11:14.381
But don't think we have,
cos the time zone's right.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.402
I won't be long.

11:30.362 --> 11:32.334
What are you doing down there?

11:33.334 --> 11:34.425
Nothing.

11:34.426 --> 11:36.422
Er... I'm just...

11:40.342 --> 11:41.365
What's your name?

11:41.366 --> 11:43.338
Rupert. Oh. OK.

11:44.338 --> 11:45.345
Hello, Rupert.

11:45.346 --> 11:48.361
Rupert Pink. It's a stupid name.

11:48.362 --> 11:50.357
No, it isn't.

11:50.358 --> 11:52.333
I know somebody called Pink.

11:52.334 --> 11:54.369
I meant Rupert.
I'm going to change it.

11:54.370 --> 11:56.338
Why are you awake?

11:58.382 --> 11:59.398
Are you scared?

12:15.414 --> 12:17.365
How did you get in?

12:17.366 --> 12:18.418
Your door must be faulty.

12:25.402 --> 12:26.422
An inspection?

12:28.418 --> 12:32.329
It's two in the morning.
When better?

12:32.330 --> 12:34.349
Do you always work here nights?

12:34.350 --> 12:35.354
Most nights, yes.

12:36.354 --> 12:38.342
Ever end up talking to yourself?

12:40.330 --> 12:41.393
All the time -

12:41.394 --> 12:42.418
it's this place...

12:44.374 --> 12:45.390
..you can't help it.

12:47.382 --> 12:48.414
What about your coffee?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.358
My coffee?

12:54.390 --> 12:58.397
Sometimes, do you put it down,
and look round,

12:58.398 --> 13:00.338
and it's not there?

13:02.334 --> 13:04.381
Everybody does that. Yes.

13:04.382 --> 13:06.362
Everybody.

13:07.390 --> 13:09.417
Who turned your telly off?

13:09.418 --> 13:11.373
It does that.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.409
It...

13:12.410 --> 13:15.398
..just goes off.

13:29.414 --> 13:31.358
Hmm.

13:52.338 --> 13:53.409
Hello.

13:53.410 --> 13:54.418
Hello.

13:58.334 --> 13:59.338
Nice room.

14:03.354 --> 14:06.337
You know, you should have more
than one chair.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.361
What do you do
when people come round?

14:08.362 --> 14:09.370
Sit on the bed.

14:10.406 --> 14:12.358
Why aren't you sitting on it, then?

14:15.362 --> 14:18.358
Do you think that there's
something underneath it?

14:19.366 --> 14:20.370
Hey...

14:21.402 --> 14:24.381
..everyone thinks that... sometimes.

14:24.382 --> 14:27.354
That's just how people
think at night. Why?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.393
Did you have a dream,

14:31.394 --> 14:33.425
a hand grabbing your foot?

14:33.426 --> 14:36.373
You have, haven't you?

14:36.374 --> 14:38.369
You've had that exact dream.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.394
How did you know?

14:41.370 --> 14:44.349
Do you know why dreams
are called dreams?

14:44.350 --> 14:46.338
Why? Because they're not real.

14:47.370 --> 14:49.398
If they were,
they wouldn't need a name.

14:52.362 --> 14:53.410
What are you doing?

14:57.402 --> 14:59.405
Do you know what's under there?
What?

14:59.406 --> 15:01.338
Me!

15:03.334 --> 15:05.398
Come on! It's perfectly safe.

15:13.362 --> 15:14.421
See?

15:14.422 --> 15:17.333
Nobody here. Except us.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.373
Sometimes I hear noises.

15:19.374 --> 15:22.361
It's a house full of people,
of course you hear noises.

15:22.362 --> 15:24.341
They're all asleep.

15:24.342 --> 15:25.386
They're all dreaming.

15:27.342 --> 15:28.398
Can you hear dreams?

15:30.402 --> 15:33.382
If you're clever enough,
but they can't harm you.

15:34.402 --> 15:37.401
You know, sometimes we think
there's something behind us -

15:37.402 --> 15:40.425
and the space under your bed is
what's behind you at night.

15:40.426 --> 15:44.358
Simple as that.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

15:55.358 --> 15:57.406
Who else is in this room? Nobody.

16:01.330 --> 16:03.422
Someone must have come in.
Nobody came in.

16:19.390 --> 16:20.418
Hello?

16:32.418 --> 16:34.373
Who's this?

16:34.374 --> 16:36.354
This is a friend
of yours playing a game.

16:43.354 --> 16:46.398
Playing a trick, are you, hey,
a little trick on Rupert here?

16:56.334 --> 16:58.382
OK. It's not funny this, you know.

17:02.334 --> 17:03.413
Where is he?

17:03.414 --> 17:05.421
Doctor?
I can't find him. Can you find him?

17:05.422 --> 17:07.396
Find who? Wally.

17:07.397 --> 17:10.340
Wally? He's nowhere in this book.

17:10.342 --> 17:12.156
It's not a Where's Wally one.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.397
How would you know? Maybe you
just haven't found him yet.

17:14.423 --> 17:17.353
He's not in every book. Really?

17:17.354 --> 17:19.614
Well, that's a few years of my life
I'll be needing back.

17:21.334 --> 17:22.338
Are you scared?

17:24.402 --> 17:26.361
The thing on the bed,

17:26.362 --> 17:27.366
whatever it is...

17:28.369 --> 17:30.369
..look at it. Does it scare you?

17:30.370 --> 17:33.401
Yes. That's good.
Want to know why that's good?

17:33.402 --> 17:36.402
Why? Let me tell you about scared.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.401
Your heart is beating so hard,

17:40.402 --> 17:42.397
I can feel it through your hands.

17:42.398 --> 17:46.337
There's so much blood and oxygen
pumping through your brain,

17:46.338 --> 17:47.421
it's like rocket fuel.

17:47.422 --> 17:52.389
Right now, you could run faster
and you could fight harder

17:52.390 --> 17:55.401
you could jump higher than
ever in your life,

17:55.402 --> 18:00.393
and you are so alert
it's like you can slow down time.

18:00.394 --> 18:05.337
What's wrong with scared?
Scared is a superpower.

18:05.338 --> 18:06.369
It's your superpower.

18:06.370 --> 18:10.353
There is danger in this room
and guess what? It's you.

18:10.354 --> 18:11.362
Do you feel it?

18:13.390 --> 18:15.389
Do you think he feels it?

18:15.390 --> 18:18.333
Do you think he's scared?

18:18.334 --> 18:19.389
Nah!

18:19.390 --> 18:22.413
Loser! Turn your back on him.

18:22.414 --> 18:26.409
What? Yeah, turn your back on him,
come on.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.389
You too, Clara.

18:28.390 --> 18:29.422
Clara, your back, now.

18:32.390 --> 18:34.398
Do it, just do it now,
turn your back.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.410
Do it now, turn your back.

18:40.390 --> 18:42.381
Lovely view out this window.

18:42.382 --> 18:46.337
Yeah. Come and see all the dark.

18:46.338 --> 18:48.393
The deep and lovely dark -

18:48.394 --> 18:50.402
we'd never see the stars without it.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.413
Now. There are two possibilities.

18:53.414 --> 18:56.405
Possibility one - it's just
one of your friends standing there,

18:56.406 --> 19:00.397
and he's playing a joke on you.
Possibility two - it isn't.

19:00.398 --> 19:02.418
So, plan? Plans are good.

19:05.382 --> 19:07.394
You on the bed,
I'm talking to you now.

19:09.330 --> 19:10.401
Go in peace.

19:10.402 --> 19:12.409
We won't look.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.337
Just go.

19:14.338 --> 19:17.374
If all you want to do is stay
hidden, it's OK. Just leave.

19:28.386 --> 19:29.390
Is it gone?

19:30.390 --> 19:33.345
Don't look round, not yet.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.350
I can't hear anything.
Don't look round.

19:37.414 --> 19:40.385
Look away! Look away now! Don't look
at it! Don't look round.

19:40.386 --> 19:43.357
Don't look round - don't look
at the reflection. What is it?

19:43.358 --> 19:45.365
Imagine a thing that must
never be seen.

19:45.366 --> 19:47.369
What would it do if you saw it?
I don't know.

19:47.370 --> 19:49.337
Neither do I. Close your eyes.

19:49.338 --> 19:51.373
What?
Close your eyes. You too, Clara.

19:51.374 --> 19:52.382
Give it what it wants.

19:53.402 --> 19:56.333
Prove to it that you're not going
to look at it.

19:56.334 --> 19:59.381
Make a promise - promise you're
never going to look at it.

19:59.382 --> 20:00.422
I promise never to look.

20:06.354 --> 20:08.342
The breath on the back
of your neck...

20:09.426 --> 20:11.426
..like your hairs standing on end...

20:13.334 --> 20:16.390
..that means don't look round!

20:19.406 --> 20:21.338
Gone.

20:22.390 --> 20:23.402
Gone.

20:24.406 --> 20:26.390
He took my bedspread.

20:27.390 --> 20:30.381
Oh, the human race -
you're never happy, are you?

20:30.382 --> 20:32.425
Am I safe now? Nobody's safe,

20:32.426 --> 20:37.353
especially not at night
in the dark, anything can get you,

20:37.354 --> 20:39.334
and you're up here all alone...

20:40.386 --> 20:43.354
What was that for?
Shut up, leave this to me.

20:44.414 --> 20:47.397
These yours? They're the home's.

20:47.398 --> 20:50.361
They're yours now.
People don't need to be lied to.

20:50.362 --> 20:53.361
People don't need to be scared
by a big gray-haired stick insect,

20:53.362 --> 20:55.358
but here you are.
Stay still, shut up.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.334
See what I'm doing?

20:59.414 --> 21:03.393
This is your army.
Plastic army. Sit!

21:03.394 --> 21:06.358
And they're going to guard
under your bed.

21:07.398 --> 21:11.349
See this one? This is the boss one,

21:11.350 --> 21:13.417
the colonel -
He's going to keep a special eye out.

21:13.418 --> 21:16.385
It's broken, that one.
It doesn't have a gun.

21:16.386 --> 21:17.422
That's why he's the boss.

21:19.374 --> 21:22.373
A soldier so brave
he doesn't need a gun.

21:22.374 --> 21:24.362
He can keep the whole world safe.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.402
What shall we call him? Dan!

21:30.406 --> 21:32.397
Sorry?

21:32.398 --> 21:35.385
Dan, the soldier man.
That's what I call him.

21:35.386 --> 21:38.337
Good. Good name.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.377
Yeah.

21:39.378 --> 21:42.349
Would you read me a story?
It'll help me get to sleep.

21:42.350 --> 21:43.353
Sure.

21:43.354 --> 21:44.362
Once upon a time...

21:45.362 --> 21:46.386
..the end.

21:47.410 --> 21:49.334
Dad skills.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.358
So...

21:56.374 --> 21:59.425
is it possible we just saved that kid
from another kid in a bedspread?

21:59.426 --> 22:01.361
Entirely possible, yes.

22:01.362 --> 22:05.334
The bigger question why did
we end up with him, and not you?

22:06.410 --> 22:07.425
I got distracted.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.413
But why that particular boy?

22:09.414 --> 22:11.377
You don't have any... you don't

22:11.378 --> 22:13.181
have any kind of connection
with him, do you?

22:13.182 --> 22:14.421
No. No, no, no, of course not.

22:14.422 --> 22:17.386
Why do you ask? The TARDIS was slaved
to your timeline.

22:18.398 --> 22:21.417
Theoretically, there should have
been some connection.

22:21.418 --> 22:23.338
Will, um...

22:24.378 --> 22:25.618
..will he remember any of that?

22:26.418 --> 22:28.389
Scrambled his memory,

22:28.390 --> 22:32.366
gave him a big old dream about
being Dan the soldier man.

22:39.394 --> 22:41.337
Are you OK?

22:41.338 --> 22:42.405
Doctor...

22:42.406 --> 22:46.421
I am sorry to ask, and I realise this
is probably against the laws of time,

22:46.422 --> 22:48.406
or summat... um...

22:50.350 --> 22:51.390
Could you do me a favour?

23:03.362 --> 23:05.369
Is that what
I look like from the back?

23:05.370 --> 23:06.409
It's fine.

23:06.410 --> 23:08.417
I was thinking it was good.

23:08.418 --> 23:10.334
Really?

23:31.346 --> 23:32.386
Sorry!

23:33.386 --> 23:34.414
Hey.

23:41.342 --> 23:43.393
Hello. I am Clara Oswald.

23:43.394 --> 23:47.385
I'm a bit tricky sometimes, a bit up
myself, and I don't like my surname,

23:47.386 --> 23:50.374
but I think that's basically
everything you need to worry about.

23:55.330 --> 23:57.393
Hello, I'm... I'm sorry...

23:57.394 --> 24:00.373
Also, I mouth off when I'm nervous
and I've got a mouth on me.

24:00.374 --> 24:03.369
Seriously, it's got a mind of its
own. I'm worried it wants to go solo.

24:03.370 --> 24:06.333
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.

24:06.334 --> 24:07.402
Or say something nice.

24:09.350 --> 24:10.390
I like your name.

24:14.406 --> 24:16.341
It's a start.

24:16.342 --> 24:18.381
Oswald. It suits you.

24:18.382 --> 24:20.421
Drifting now.
It's better than Pink.

24:20.422 --> 24:24.341
No, Pink... Pink is nice. I like pink.

24:24.342 --> 24:25.389
You can have it.

24:25.390 --> 24:27.341
Oh, a bold offer, Mr Pink.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.385
I meant... No...

24:29.386 --> 24:31.413
I know, I know.

24:31.414 --> 24:33.405
Why can't I speak today?

24:33.406 --> 24:36.329
It's that foot you're
keeping in your mouth.

24:36.330 --> 24:37.405
Is that where I put it?

24:37.406 --> 24:41.413
Anyway. Clara Pink - too much.

24:41.414 --> 24:44.329
Yeah, it is a bit much.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.358
Mind you - RUPERT Pink!

24:46.410 --> 24:48.338
Sorry?

24:49.422 --> 24:52.329
Er...

24:52.330 --> 24:55.397
Rupert... Pink. It's not good.

24:55.398 --> 24:57.369
Rupert?

24:57.370 --> 24:59.374
Yeah. That was your name, yeah?

25:00.406 --> 25:05.414
Who told you that?
Um... someone in the school.

25:09.366 --> 25:11.349
No, I haven't used
that name for years.

25:11.350 --> 25:13.341
I cannot remember who it was, er...

25:13.342 --> 25:16.409
Are you making fun of me?
No! No, no, no - no way!

25:16.410 --> 25:20.366
Is this a joke? Danny, nothing
about this is any kind of joke!

25:24.358 --> 25:25.409
Where's your coat?

25:25.410 --> 25:28.409
My what?
You put your coat on when you left.

25:28.410 --> 25:30.361
I'm really sorry. Danny, um...

25:30.362 --> 25:33.337
there is something I should probably
be honest about.

25:33.338 --> 25:36.354
How about everything? Everything,
in my case, is actually quite a lot.

25:37.382 --> 25:40.365
Well, that's weird. No, it's not
weird, not really...

25:40.366 --> 25:41.393
Where are you going?

25:41.394 --> 25:44.401
I don't do weird. Don't go.

25:44.402 --> 25:46.393
Then do something for me -

25:46.394 --> 25:50.349
tell me the truth, because I know
when people are lying to me.

25:50.350 --> 25:54.349
However weird this thing might be,
just tell me the truth!

25:54.350 --> 25:55.378
It's not weird...

25:58.402 --> 26:00.338
..exactly.

26:02.426 --> 26:04.330
I've had enough.

26:28.406 --> 26:30.397
I am trying to have a date -

26:30.398 --> 26:34.373
a real life,
inter-human actual date!

26:34.374 --> 26:37.165
It's a normal nice, everyday,
meeting-up sort of thing,

26:37.166 --> 26:39.425
and I would just like to know,
is there any other way

26:39.426 --> 26:43.350
you can make this any more surreal
than it already is?

26:45.418 --> 26:47.389
Hello.

26:47.390 --> 26:49.374
Ah, Clara!

26:50.406 --> 26:52.354
Well done, you found her.

26:53.386 --> 26:56.373
Now this is really a bit strange.

26:56.374 --> 26:57.397
Danny?

26:57.398 --> 27:00.365
What's gone wrong with your face?
It's all eyes!

27:00.366 --> 27:02.409
Why are you all eyes?
Get them under control.

27:02.410 --> 27:07.341
Who's Danny?
This is Colonel Orson Pink,

27:07.342 --> 27:09.417
from about 100 years
in your future.

27:09.418 --> 27:11.373
Orson Pink?

27:11.374 --> 27:14.405
Yeah, I laughed too. Sorry!

27:14.406 --> 27:17.381
Do you have any connection with him?

27:17.382 --> 27:22.353
Connection? Yes, maybe you're like
a distant relative or something?

27:22.354 --> 27:24.421
How would I know?

27:24.422 --> 27:27.333
Right, OK.

27:27.334 --> 27:32.365
Um, well... do you have any old
family photographs of her?

27:32.366 --> 27:36.369
You know, probably quite old
and really fat-looking?

27:36.370 --> 27:37.386
I don't.

27:41.346 --> 27:42.397
How did you find him?

27:42.398 --> 27:44.833
You left a trace in the TARDIS
telepathic circuits.

27:44.834 --> 27:47.421
I fired them up again and the TARDIS
brought me straight to him.

27:47.422 --> 27:50.381
So he's something to do
with your timeline.

27:50.382 --> 27:53.358
OK... And you'll never guess where
I found him.

28:00.334 --> 28:01.365
Where are we?

28:01.366 --> 28:03.329
The end of the road -

28:03.330 --> 28:04.409
this is it,

28:04.410 --> 28:06.350
the end of everything...

28:08.338 --> 28:09.373
..the last planet.

28:09.374 --> 28:10.381
The end of the universe?

28:10.382 --> 28:12.373
The TARDIS isn't supposed
to come this far

28:12.374 --> 28:15.333
but some idiot turned
the safeguards off.

28:15.334 --> 28:16.342
Listen!

28:18.418 --> 28:20.330
To what?

28:22.390 --> 28:24.357
Nothing.

28:24.358 --> 28:25.402
There's nothing to hear.

28:27.342 --> 28:29.342
There's nothing anywhere...

28:31.346 --> 28:33.389
..not a breath,

28:33.390 --> 28:36.409
not a slither,
not a click or a tick.

28:36.410 --> 28:38.361
All the clocks have stopped.

28:38.362 --> 28:42.398
This is the silence
at the end of time.

28:48.346 --> 28:52.345
Then how did he get here? If he's
from 100 years in my future...

28:52.346 --> 28:53.390
Pioneer time traveller.

28:55.382 --> 28:57.389
Rode the first of the great
time shots.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.353
They were supposed to fire him

28:59.354 --> 29:01.357
into the middle of the next week.
What happened?

29:01.358 --> 29:03.365
He went a bit far. A bit?

29:03.366 --> 29:04.385
A big bit.

29:04.386 --> 29:09.333
Look at him now. Robinson Crusoe
at the end of time itself -

29:09.334 --> 29:11.349
the last man
standing in the universe.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.329
I always thought that would be me.

29:13.330 --> 29:15.601
It's not a competition.
I know it's not a competition,

29:15.602 --> 29:17.385
course it isn't.

29:17.386 --> 29:20.333
Still time, though.
He looks like he's packing.

29:20.334 --> 29:22.793
He's been stranded for six months,
just met a time traveller -

29:22.794 --> 29:24.734
of course he's packing.

29:27.370 --> 29:29.393
You can do it, then?
You can get me home?

29:29.394 --> 29:32.389
I just showed you, didn't I?
A test flight to a restaurant.

29:32.390 --> 29:35.373
Yes, but to my family,
to my own time?

29:35.374 --> 29:38.354
Easy! I can do that, can't I, Clara?
He can, yes.

29:39.370 --> 29:40.417
Is everything OK?

29:40.418 --> 29:42.373
Yeah, fine. I'm fine.

29:42.374 --> 29:45.401
Do I know you? No, nope.

29:45.402 --> 29:47.053
Is she doing the "all eyes" thing?

29:47.054 --> 29:49.413
It's because her face is so wide.
She needs three mirrors!

29:49.414 --> 29:51.345
Doctor...!

29:51.346 --> 29:55.329
We can't leave immediately, though.
The TARDIS needs to recharge.

29:55.330 --> 29:56.358
Sorry...

29:57.362 --> 29:58.366
..what?

29:59.386 --> 30:02.402
Overnight, that should do it,
shouldn't it Clara? Overnight?

30:06.386 --> 30:07.402
One more night, that's...

30:09.350 --> 30:10.614
..that's not a problem, is it?

30:13.386 --> 30:14.390
No.

30:16.386 --> 30:17.410
No, no problem.

30:22.382 --> 30:23.618
Oh, that's a shame, isn't it?

30:26.358 --> 30:27.401
What's a shame?

30:27.402 --> 30:29.425
There's only three people
left in the universe

30:29.426 --> 30:32.381
and you're lying to the other two.

30:32.382 --> 30:34.949
It was the first thing I noticed
when I stepped in here.

30:34.950 --> 30:36.401
You must have seen it, too, Clara -

30:36.402 --> 30:39.366
you've got eyes out to here!
Seen what? The universe is dead.

30:40.382 --> 30:43.378
Everything that ever was
is dead and gone.

30:44.394 --> 30:47.350
There is nothing beyond this door
but nothingness for ever.

30:48.374 --> 30:49.406
So why is it locked?

30:51.338 --> 30:52.342
Please...

30:53.402 --> 30:56.330
..don't make me
spend another night here.

30:57.358 --> 30:58.385
Afraid of the dark?

30:58.386 --> 31:01.410
But the dark... is empty now.

31:04.382 --> 31:05.386
No.

31:07.422 --> 31:09.354
No, it isn't.

31:11.406 --> 31:15.398
You'll be safe in here. Nothing gets
through those doors, I promise.

31:18.366 --> 31:20.345
And you two are going to
wait out there?

31:20.346 --> 31:23.345
That would seem to be the plan.
Wait for what exactly?

31:23.346 --> 31:24.401
Why can't we just leave?

31:24.402 --> 31:27.381
Like he said - it's recharging.

31:27.382 --> 31:30.385
You didn't look like you
believed him.

31:30.386 --> 31:33.334
That's just how my face looks
when he talks.

31:39.418 --> 31:41.401
It's just a silly toy thing,

31:41.402 --> 31:43.413
family heirloom - supposed
to bring good luck.

31:43.414 --> 31:45.338
Right. Yes.

31:47.410 --> 31:49.393
Didn't do a very good job, did it?

31:49.394 --> 31:52.405
It did. You're here, aren't you?

31:52.406 --> 31:55.330
What were the chances of you
two finding me?

32:00.346 --> 32:01.362
Orson...

32:03.346 --> 32:06.417
..do me a favour,
take my advice when you get home,

32:06.418 --> 32:09.353
stay away from time travel.

32:09.354 --> 32:10.386
It runs in the family.

32:13.374 --> 32:14.393
What?

32:14.394 --> 32:18.337
Sorry - what do you mean,
"runs in the family"?

32:18.338 --> 32:24.345
Nothing - it's just silly stories -
one of my grandparent - well,

32:24.346 --> 32:27.350
great-grandparents...
What is it? Tell me!

32:30.410 --> 32:32.366
You asked if you knew me.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.410
It's a family heirloom? Yeah.

32:46.350 --> 32:47.389
What are we doing?

32:47.390 --> 32:50.398
Waiting. For what? For who?

32:52.362 --> 32:56.333
If everybody in the universe is dead,
then there's nobody out there.

32:56.334 --> 32:57.714
That's one way of looking at it.

32:58.414 --> 33:01.341
What's the other?

33:01.342 --> 33:02.706
That's a hell of a lot of ghosts.

33:04.846 --> 33:06.413
Do you have your own
mood lighting now?

33:06.414 --> 33:09.342
Because, frankly,
the accent is enough.

33:16.338 --> 33:18.389
Where did that come from?
It's always been there.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.381
It's only visible
in the night light.

33:20.382 --> 33:21.417
But who wrote it?

33:21.418 --> 33:25.346
Colonel Pink. Apparently, at night,
he needs a reminder.

33:26.370 --> 33:30.381
Six months stranded alone,
I suppose it must be tempting.

33:30.382 --> 33:32.329
What is?

33:32.330 --> 33:33.334
Company.

33:36.414 --> 33:37.418
What's that?

33:39.422 --> 33:42.406
What kind of explanation
would you like? A reassuring one.

33:45.374 --> 33:48.334
Well, the systems are switching
to low power.

33:49.242 --> 33:51.409
There are temperature differentials
all over this ship.

33:51.410 --> 33:55.385
It's like pipes banging
when the heating goes off.

33:55.386 --> 33:59.362
Always thought there was
something in the pipes. Me, too.

34:01.334 --> 34:02.706
Who were you having dinner with?

34:05.370 --> 34:07.337
Are you making conversation?

34:07.338 --> 34:08.806
I thought that
I would give it a try.

34:11.378 --> 34:13.360
I told you. A date.

34:13.362 --> 34:15.400
Serious? It's a date.

34:15.402 --> 34:17.342
A serious date?

34:18.353 --> 34:20.409
Do I have to bring him to you
for approval?

34:20.409 --> 34:23.369
Well, I would like to know about
his prospects.

34:23.370 --> 34:26.357
If you like,
I can pop ahead and check them out.

34:26.358 --> 34:28.353
Frankly, you've already done enough.

34:36.330 --> 34:38.330
Atmospheric pressure equalising...

34:39.402 --> 34:41.333
Or?

34:42.362 --> 34:43.373
Company.

34:48.389 --> 34:50.405
Why are we doing this?
Why don't we just go?

34:50.406 --> 34:53.341
Because I need to know.
Why? About what?

34:53.342 --> 34:57.345
Suppose that there are creatures
that live to hide -

34:57.346 --> 35:00.373
that only show themselves
to the very young or the very old

35:00.374 --> 35:03.365
or the mad or anyone who wouldn't
be believed... OK...

35:03.366 --> 35:06.353
What would those creatures do
when everyone was gone,

35:06.354 --> 35:10.338
when there was only one
man left standing in the universe?

35:12.410 --> 35:14.369
What's that?

35:14.370 --> 35:16.357
Potentially, the hull cooling.

35:16.358 --> 35:17.393
"Potentially"?

35:17.394 --> 35:18.406
Believably.

35:22.362 --> 35:23.390
Someone knocking.

35:25.338 --> 35:26.350
Yes.

35:29.366 --> 35:33.417
Doctor, you don't actually believe
all this, do you?

35:33.418 --> 35:35.357
Hiding creatures -

35:35.358 --> 35:37.338
things from under the bed.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.410
What's that in the mirror?

35:42.334 --> 35:43.398
Or the corner of your eye?

35:45.374 --> 35:48.414
What's that footstep following,
but never passing by?

35:50.382 --> 35:53.362
Did we come to the end of the
universe because of a nursery rhyme?

36:08.402 --> 36:11.410
That's you turning, right? No.

36:13.382 --> 36:15.390
Get in the TARDIS. Why?

36:17.402 --> 36:19.394
I have to know.

36:21.374 --> 36:23.345
Doctor. Doctor...

36:23.346 --> 36:25.353
The TARDIS, now!

36:25.354 --> 36:28.361
OK. OK. Somebody is out there -
now we know we can leave!

36:28.362 --> 36:31.337
Oh, Doctor! It's a pressure lock -
releasing it

36:31.338 --> 36:33.329
could've triggered
the opening mechanism.

36:33.330 --> 36:36.129
Is there an atmosphere out there?
There's an air shell round the ship.

36:36.130 --> 36:38.850
Why are you still here? Because I'm
not going to leave you in danger!

36:38.875 --> 36:42.353
Then you will never travel with me
again, because that is the deal!

36:42.354 --> 36:45.374
TARDIS, now! Do as you are told!

36:47.386 --> 36:49.354
You're an idiot.

36:50.398 --> 36:51.402
I know.

36:53.342 --> 36:55.369
What's happening?
He's opening the door.

36:55.370 --> 36:58.409
Perhaps they're all just waiting,
perhaps when we're all dead,

36:58.410 --> 37:03.330
out they'll come a-slithering
from underneath the bed.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.418
Oh, no, no, no, not now, come on!

37:13.366 --> 37:16.342
Oh-h! Always when it's important!

37:18.394 --> 37:20.366
What's happening?

37:22.330 --> 37:23.341
What's that?

37:23.342 --> 37:25.414
The alarm -
the air shell's breached.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.330
Stay here.

37:46.370 --> 37:47.405
Is he OK?

37:47.406 --> 37:49.418
He's out cold.
He'll be fine, though.

37:51.346 --> 37:52.397
Something hit him.

37:52.398 --> 37:55.393
Everything was flying
out of that door.

37:55.394 --> 37:58.362
Could've been that.

38:00.386 --> 38:02.373
Yeah.

38:02.374 --> 38:03.410
What was out there?

38:05.386 --> 38:06.518
What were you so afraid of?

38:08.406 --> 38:12.357
I've been here a long time -
my own shadow, probably.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.426
Yeah.

38:16.394 --> 38:20.374
That's probably just
the rest of the air escaping.

38:22.362 --> 38:24.406
You say "probably" a lot.

38:26.410 --> 38:29.373
We are safe?
Nothing can get in here, right?

38:29.374 --> 38:30.378
Probably.

38:37.386 --> 38:39.373
Have you got a plan?

38:39.374 --> 38:42.353
Telepathic circuits.
I left a trace in them before.

38:42.354 --> 38:44.425
So? So, apparently that can do
a "thing".

38:44.426 --> 38:48.329
That's your plan?
It's not a plan. It's a "thing".

38:48.330 --> 38:51.378
OK. Come on, come on,
you can do it!

38:53.346 --> 38:55.329
Come on!

38:55.330 --> 38:56.369
Sorry!

38:56.370 --> 38:58.414
Here we go!

39:05.346 --> 39:06.378
Come on!

39:12.394 --> 39:13.402
Is that it?

39:16.426 --> 39:18.401
I don't know.

39:18.402 --> 39:20.361
I think so.

39:20.362 --> 39:21.385
Where are we?

39:21.386 --> 39:25.361
Somewhere else. I hope! No, no, no,
you stay, look after the Doctor.

39:25.362 --> 39:26.918
You can't go out there by yourself.

39:30.362 --> 39:32.350
Thing is, my timeline,
it keeps on...

39:34.370 --> 39:36.369
Orson, you don't want
to meet yourself.

39:36.370 --> 39:37.414
It's really embarrassing.

40:30.378 --> 40:31.398
Rupert?

40:49.338 --> 40:50.346
Orson?

40:59.330 --> 41:01.401
Why does he have to sleep
out here?

41:01.402 --> 41:04.365
He doesn't want the others to
hear him crying.

41:04.366 --> 41:07.337
Why does he have to cry
all the time? You know why.

41:07.338 --> 41:10.402
There'll be no crying in the army.
Hush!

41:11.402 --> 41:15.365
Don't pretend you're not
awake. We're not idiots.

41:15.366 --> 41:18.406
Come and sleep in the house.
You don't have to be alone!

41:19.426 --> 41:21.233
If you can hear me,

41:21.234 --> 41:23.373
you're very welcome in the house,
with the other boys.

41:23.374 --> 41:27.342
I'll leave the door on the latch.
Come in, any time.

41:28.422 --> 41:31.037
He can't just run away
crying all the time

41:31.038 --> 41:32.405
if he wants to join the army.

41:32.406 --> 41:36.337
He doesn't want to join the army.
I keep telling you.

41:36.338 --> 41:38.418
Well, he's not going to the Academy,
is he, that boy?

41:38.443 --> 41:40.407
He'll never make a Time Lord.

41:51.422 --> 41:54.413
Sontarans! Perverting
the course of human history!

41:54.414 --> 41:55.421
Doctor?

41:55.422 --> 41:57.414
You're confusing me.
Shut up, shut up!

41:58.418 --> 41:59.421
Where's Clara?

41:59.422 --> 42:02.366
Clara! Clara!

42:04.366 --> 42:06.402
Hello, who's there?

42:12.334 --> 42:13.394
Hello?

42:21.414 --> 42:23.350
It's OK.

42:25.370 --> 42:27.362
This is just a dream.

42:28.414 --> 42:33.365
Just lie back again,
just lie back on the bed.

42:33.366 --> 42:38.342
It will all be OK
if you just lie down and go to sleep.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.350
Just do that for me.

42:45.346 --> 42:47.334
Just sleep.

43:24.418 --> 43:26.426
Listen...

43:28.378 --> 43:31.405
What happened? What did you see?

43:31.406 --> 43:33.425
What's out there?

43:33.426 --> 43:36.345
What if there was nothing?

43:36.346 --> 43:38.397
What if there never was anything?

43:38.398 --> 43:42.409
Nothing under the bed,
nothing at the door.

43:42.410 --> 43:46.425
What if the big bad Time Lord
doesn't want to admit

43:46.426 --> 43:48.382
he's just afraid of the dark.

43:53.338 --> 43:56.333
Where are we? Have we moved?
Where have we landed?

43:56.334 --> 43:57.341
Don't look where we are.

43:57.342 --> 43:59.718
Take off, and promise me
you'll never look where we've been.

44:01.418 --> 44:04.362
Why?
Just take off, don't ask questions.

44:06.374 --> 44:08.357
I don't take orders, Clara!

44:08.358 --> 44:10.346
Do as you're told!

44:20.418 --> 44:22.414
'Listen...'

44:25.410 --> 44:27.342
This is just a dream.

44:28.414 --> 44:30.377
But very clever people

44:30.378 --> 44:31.413
can hear dreams.

44:31.414 --> 44:33.402
So, please, just listen.

44:36.414 --> 44:38.338
I know you're afraid...

44:40.394 --> 44:43.329
..but being afraid is all right.

44:43.330 --> 44:44.922
Because didn't anybody
ever tell you...

44:47.354 --> 44:49.390
..fear is a superpower?

44:52.338 --> 44:54.393
Fear can make you faster

44:54.394 --> 44:56.418
and cleverer and stronger.

44:58.370 --> 45:02.329
And one day, you're going to come
back to this barn,

45:02.330 --> 45:06.334
and on that day you are going
to be very afraid indeed.

45:07.366 --> 45:08.418
But that's OK.

45:10.334 --> 45:14.346
Because if you're very wise
and very strong...

45:16.414 --> 45:19.418
..fear doesn't have to make
you cruel or cowardly...

45:21.418 --> 45:23.386
'..fear can make you kind.'

45:25.406 --> 45:29.354
No, no! Not the hugging! No, no, no.
I'm against the hugging, please...

45:40.426 --> 45:42.378
I am so... I know.

45:48.382 --> 45:50.389
It doesn't matter if there's nothing

45:50.390 --> 45:53.329
under the bed or in the dark,

45:53.330 --> 45:55.345
so long as you know it's OK

45:55.346 --> 45:56.402
to be afraid of it.

45:58.334 --> 45:59.381
I just get nervous.

45:59.382 --> 46:01.402
Me too. I don't even know what
I'm nervous of!

46:02.422 --> 46:04.385
I'll show you.

46:04.386 --> 46:09.353
So, listen. If you listen to nothing
else, listen to this.

46:09.354 --> 46:11.354
You're always going to be afraid...

46:14.338 --> 46:16.354
..even if you learn to hide it.

46:17.402 --> 46:19.366
Fear is like...

46:22.342 --> 46:23.346
..a companion...

46:24.358 --> 46:26.346
..a constant companion, always there.

46:27.418 --> 46:30.381
But that's OK,

46:30.382 --> 46:32.374
because fear can bring us together.

46:34.366 --> 46:36.386
Fear can bring you home.

46:38.358 --> 46:41.358
I'm going to leave you something,
just so you'll always remember...

46:43.386 --> 46:46.370
..fear makes companions of us all.

46:54.406 --> 46:57.333
'This is the Bank of Karabraxos...'

46:57.334 --> 47:00.378
Picture the thing you want
most in the universe...

47:00.379 --> 47:01.385
Aggh.

47:01.386 --> 47:03.337
..decide how badly you want it.

47:03.338 --> 47:05.405
We're actually going to do it -
rob the bank?

47:05.406 --> 47:08.409
If we don't, we die.

47:08.410 --> 47:10.397
We must locate them.

47:10.398 --> 47:12.373
What is that?!

47:12.374 --> 47:14.345
I don't know. Hate not knowing.

47:14.346 --> 47:15.418
Are you hungry, boy?

47:17.143 --> 47:19.230
The bank is now open.

47:19.255 --> 47:21.000
