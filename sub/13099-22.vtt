WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:05.000
[dramatic music]

00:10.042 --> 00:12.333
Target acquired.
Lock it on.

00:12.417 --> 00:14.292
[beeping]

00:14.375 --> 00:15.583
Firing.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.042
[gunfire]

00:21.125 --> 00:24.167
(female #1)
'That's a fox one, C and C.'

00:24.250 --> 00:25.583
(Ivanova)
'Confirmed, Delta Seven.'

00:25.667 --> 00:27.583
'You're dead, Zeta leader.'

00:27.667 --> 00:28.875
Damn it!

00:30.500 --> 00:33.458
Good shooting, Delta Seven.
Are you okay?

00:33.542 --> 00:37.083
(female #1)
'I started to black out,
for a second, but it passed.'

00:37.167 --> 00:39.167
Alright,
everyone pay attention

00:39.250 --> 00:41.417
and learn
from Zeta leader's mistakes.

00:41.500 --> 00:45.083
Now, if the enemy
does something unexpected

00:45.167 --> 00:48.292
don't try and keep the lock on
get out of the line of fire

00:48.375 --> 00:50.792
'before you try
re-acquiring your target.'

00:50.875 --> 00:54.167
And remember this,
some aliens can handle G-forces

00:54.250 --> 00:57.167
better than we can,
and the Centauri are willing to

00:57.250 --> 00:58.833
put their fighters on autopilot

00:58.917 --> 01:00.333
and risk blacking out

01:00.417 --> 01:02.667
if it gives them the optimum
firing position

01:02.750 --> 01:04.292
when they come out.

01:04.375 --> 01:06.000
[beeping]

01:06.083 --> 01:08.458
(Ivanova)
'Captain, this is C and C, we've
got an emergency back here.'

01:08.542 --> 01:10.958
'Recommend you head back
to the barn.'

01:11.042 --> 01:13.500
Alright. On my way.

01:13.583 --> 01:16.125
Zeta leader, you and the rest
of Zeta Squadron

01:16.208 --> 01:19.000
continue practicing this
maneuver until you get it right.

01:19.083 --> 01:20.208
(male #1)
'Yes, sir.'

01:27.083 --> 01:30.167
[indistinct chatter]

01:35.625 --> 01:37.500
Sometimes I get so close

01:37.583 --> 01:41.333
and yet it seems I'm shut out
of the important things.

01:41.417 --> 01:43.167
It's a useless feeling.

01:43.250 --> 01:45.458
The ambassador is definitely
going through some changes.

01:45.542 --> 01:48.083
- He even looks different.
- Indeed.

01:48.167 --> 01:50.333
And now with the military
starting to stampede

01:50.417 --> 01:52.000
over everyone
and everything.

01:52.083 --> 01:54.917
People coming and going
and secret meetings.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.667
You never know
what it's all about

01:56.750 --> 01:58.333
until later when it's too late.

01:58.417 --> 02:00.333
And they never listen to us.

02:00.417 --> 02:02.458
- Makes me nervous.
- Makes me nervous.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.000
Same time tomorrow?

02:09.083 --> 02:10.083
Sure.

02:14.292 --> 02:16.000
- Captain?
- Yeah?

02:16.083 --> 02:17.542
The Drazi and Pak'ma'ra
ambassadors

02:17.625 --> 02:18.708
are waiting in your office.

02:18.792 --> 02:20.750
They say it's absolutely urgent.

02:20.833 --> 02:22.833
- Oh.
- How's the squad doing?

02:22.917 --> 02:24.292
Good, but they should be better.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.417
I want all our fighters
put through training exercises

02:26.500 --> 02:28.583
three times a week, from now on.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.167
With everything that's going on

02:30.250 --> 02:31.750
we need them
in top fighting condition.

02:31.833 --> 02:32.917
I'll see to it personally

02:33.000 --> 02:34.375
and if they don't get any better

02:34.458 --> 02:36.000
I'll start issuing live ammo.

02:36.083 --> 02:39.292
That should have a very
inspirational effect.

02:40.458 --> 02:42.542
Are you sure about this,
ambassador?

02:42.625 --> 02:46.667
Yes, most sure.
You do not mistake.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.583
The Centauri have invaded
both our territories.

02:49.667 --> 02:51.583
They have taken
one of our listening posts.

02:51.667 --> 02:54.208
They say
they have liberated it.

02:54.292 --> 02:55.792
We hear, they are preparing

02:55.875 --> 02:58.292
to attack other races,
other worlds.

02:58.375 --> 03:03.083
War is spreading. Soon,
perhaps they even attack you.

03:09.333 --> 03:12.000
(Sheridan)
The Babylon project
was our last

03:12.083 --> 03:14.583
best hope for peace.

03:14.667 --> 03:17.625
A self-contained world
five miles long

03:17.708 --> 03:20.042
located in neutral territory.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.417
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

03:25.500 --> 03:29.083
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens..

03:29.167 --> 03:32.125
..a shining beacon in space

03:32.208 --> 03:34.375
all alone in the night.

03:34.458 --> 03:37.833
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

03:37.917 --> 03:41.000
the year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.625
This is the story

03:43.708 --> 03:46.333
of the last
of the Babylon Stations.

03:46.417 --> 03:48.458
The year is 2259.

03:48.542 --> 03:51.500
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.625
[theme music]

04:24.583 --> 04:27.667
[music continues]

04:38.083 --> 04:39.875
[dramatic music]

04:45.875 --> 04:47.375
Ambassador Mollari,
as you requested.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.458
Captain, I will have you know,
I was in the middle--

04:49.542 --> 04:51.167
What the hell do you think
you are doing?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.958
Do not address me
in that tone of voice.

04:54.042 --> 04:56.042
I came here out of good will.
Because I was told--

04:56.125 --> 04:59.125
Your forces are moving in
on the Drazi and the Pak'ma'ra.

04:59.208 --> 05:02.542
You are destabilizing
the whole area.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.042
What's wrong?

05:04.125 --> 05:06.708
Bombing the Narn back to the
Stone Age wasn't enough for you?

05:06.792 --> 05:09.875
We are trying to stabilize
the region, captain.

05:09.958 --> 05:12.000
Putting a buffer zone
around the Centauri Republic

05:12.083 --> 05:13.333
will lessen tensions

05:13.417 --> 05:14.958
and decrease
the risk of conflict.

05:15.042 --> 05:18.250
You call it a buffer zone.
The Drazi call it an invasion.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.042
They're exaggerating.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.375
We are merely establishing
a presence.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.125
'Well, where does
that presence end?'

05:24.208 --> 05:26.458
Tell me that, ambassador.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.917
Show me on the map
where it's going to end.

05:30.542 --> 05:31.708
Londo..

05:33.458 --> 05:35.500
[sighs]
Everything is falling apart

05:35.583 --> 05:38.875
and the Centauri
are at the center of it all.

05:38.958 --> 05:41.583
Can't your people see that?

05:41.667 --> 05:43.583
see that?

05:45.792 --> 05:48.083
I do not have to listen to this.

05:48.167 --> 05:51.458
Your authority ends
at Babylon 5, captain.

05:51.542 --> 05:54.417
Do not start getting
delusions of grandeur.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.500
You will not survive them.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.292
He's not the Londo
I used to know anymore.

06:04.375 --> 06:07.042
He used to be
you could talk to the guy

06:07.125 --> 06:08.083
you could reason with him.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.708
Okay, he was a pain in the butt

06:09.792 --> 06:12.500
but he was our pain in the butt.
And now..

06:13.958 --> 06:16.875
You're the closest thing
he has to a friend here.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.917
Is there any way
to get through to him?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.292
Not as long as he's afraid.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.792
As long as he's afraid?

06:21.875 --> 06:23.417
Yeah.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.917
Look into his eyes sometime.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.125
He can see how fast
things are moving.

06:28.208 --> 06:30.917
For Londo, it's like being stuck
on a wild horse.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.792
You don't want to get thrown,
so you hang on ever harder.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.958
He's trapped,
you know, half the time

06:37.042 --> 06:40.042
I'm so furious with the guy,
I could break his neck.

06:40.125 --> 06:43.000
The other half,
I feel sorry for him.

06:43.083 --> 06:47.125
[clicks tongue]
So, what do you figure
on doing about this?

06:47.208 --> 06:49.583
I made a full report
to Earthdome.

06:49.667 --> 06:51.000
[smirks]

06:51.083 --> 06:52.542
They could ignore the problem

06:52.625 --> 06:55.250
as long as it was just the Narn
and Centauri fighting it up

06:55.333 --> 06:57.125
but with the other races
getting involved..

06:57.208 --> 06:58.333
[beeping]

06:59.250 --> 07:00.375
Sheridan.

07:00.458 --> 07:01.667
(Ivanova)
'We just had an Earthforce ship'

07:01.750 --> 07:03.333
'carrying a VIP
come through the gate.'

07:03.417 --> 07:06.333
'It's Frederick Lantz
from the Ministry of Peace.'

07:06.417 --> 07:07.833
On my way.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.667
Well, what do you know?

07:11.750 --> 07:14.667
Maybe somebody actually
read my report for a change.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.250
Don't hold your breath.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.542
Oh, I could sleep for a week.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.125
Every time I close my eyes,
all I see are tac displays

07:24.208 --> 07:26.667
and firing solutions.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.333
Just wish I knew what's
got the captain's so rattled.

07:30.625 --> 07:33.458
- Maybe it's the ghost.
- What ghost?

07:33.542 --> 07:36.500
Oh, a couple of guys say
they saw something in hyperspace

07:36.583 --> 07:39.208
coming back from a job
in Sector 14.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.667
'Sounds like they've been
sucking down thruster fumes.'

07:41.750 --> 07:44.125
- Anybody else see it?
- No, just them.

07:44.208 --> 07:46.875
Said it looked like a cross
between a spider

07:46.958 --> 07:48.708
and your worst nightmare.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.875
Get your hand off me.
Don't touch me!

07:56.375 --> 07:57.792
[indistinct chatter]

07:57.875 --> 08:00.042
(male #2)
'Honey, this is nuts..'

08:00.125 --> 08:03.500
Mr. Lantz, welcome.
It's good to see you.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.958
Thank you, captain.

08:05.042 --> 08:06.583
This is Mr. Welles,
my co-director.

08:06.667 --> 08:08.667
He's in charge
of the Night Watch program.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.542
- Pleasure, captain.
- Commander Ivanova.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.667
Charmed, I want you
to set aside an office

08:12.750 --> 08:15.208
made to interview
the Centauri Ambassador

08:15.292 --> 08:17.208
and those in the league
of non-aligned worlds

08:17.292 --> 08:19.417
whose territory
has been infringed.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.000
- Already done.
- Good.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.208
As long as we're here I'd like
to check in on the local members

08:23.292 --> 08:24.542
of the Night Watch.
If that's alright.

08:24.625 --> 08:25.833
No, it's not a problem.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.292
I've assigned Commander Ivanova
as your liaison.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.000
If there's anything you need,
just ask.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.667
Excellent.
Excellent, thank you.

08:31.750 --> 08:34.167
I must say
I'm relieved to see you.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.833
I was afraid Earth
was never gonna get involved

08:35.917 --> 08:37.250
in the Centauri problem.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.667
We can't stand by forever,
you know.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.042
Our voice has to be heard.

08:40.125 --> 08:41.500
But, it never hurts to get
a first hand look

08:41.583 --> 08:43.750
to see what's really
going on out there.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.875
Just to be sure
we're doing the right thing.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.375
Hey, Mitch.

08:50.458 --> 08:51.917
How's it going?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.333
I thought
you Zeta Squadron types

08:53.417 --> 08:54.958
were too good to hangout
with the rest of us.

08:55.042 --> 08:57.417
Oh. Come on.
Who told you that?

08:57.500 --> 08:58.917
Well, one of your crew
called our Furies

08:59.000 --> 09:00.625
bunch of old rust buckets.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.917
Okay, so we didn't
have our fighters

09:02.000 --> 09:03.417
hand delivered
by the president.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.833
Whoa, whoa. I'm not getting
into any of this.

09:05.917 --> 09:07.333
I got no problem with anybody

09:07.417 --> 09:10.250
who jumps into a Starfury
and rides fire.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.417
Besides, Scuttlebutt is that

09:11.500 --> 09:12.958
we're getting
new Furies in next year

09:13.042 --> 09:14.792
and you're next
in line to get them.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.042
'Come on. I just want to talk.'

09:16.125 --> 09:17.958
About what?

09:18.042 --> 09:19.250
The ghost.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.167
- I don't have to--
- It was jet black.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.458
A shade of black so deep, your
eye just kinda slides off it

09:25.542 --> 09:27.667
and it shimmered
when you looked at it.

09:27.750 --> 09:31.125
A spider big as death
and twice as ugly.

09:31.208 --> 09:34.292
When it flies past, it's like
you hear a scream in your mind.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.708
I saw it, too.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.083
Go on.

09:40.167 --> 09:41.917
It killed Commander Galus.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.500
I heard about Galus.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.750
Not about this.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.667
I filed a report,
but when it happened

09:47.750 --> 09:50.958
my systems were blown out,
so I couldn't record anything.

09:51.042 --> 09:54.500
There was nobody out there
to back me up. No evidence.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.333
'They figured he got hit
by a hyperspace shock wave.'

09:57.417 --> 09:59.292
I swore I'd prove
something was out there

09:59.375 --> 10:02.000
like nothing
we've ever seen before.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.167
I tried looking for it on my own

10:03.250 --> 10:05.417
but the captain told me
to lay off.

10:07.167 --> 10:10.375
I got to find it,
prove what happened.

10:10.458 --> 10:13.958
Look, pal, if you
really saw this thing

10:14.042 --> 10:16.875
you'd have to be out of your
mind to go out looking for it.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.000
Maybe.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.792
I've set aside the council
chambers for separate interviews

10:21.875 --> 10:24.000
with the Drazi
and Pak'ma'ra ambassadors.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.333
You'll have complete privacy.

10:25.417 --> 10:29.042
Good.
Uh, pen, pen.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.375
Ah, pen.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.167
'Ah, thank you.'

10:34.250 --> 10:36.625
Looks like an antique.

10:36.708 --> 10:40.000
My wife gave it to me
last Christmas.

10:40.083 --> 10:44.125
Do you realize it's almost
Christmas back home?

10:44.208 --> 10:45.500
It's easy to forget out here.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.875
We don't have seasons
in Babylon 5.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.917
But I noticed.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.958
Have you ever been to the Winter
Solstice Festival in Geneva?

10:54.042 --> 10:55.500
It's quite marvelous

10:55.583 --> 10:58.292
fireworks, and songs,
and costumes

10:58.375 --> 11:00.583
and food as far as
the eye can see.

11:02.292 --> 11:03.875
And the children.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.708
How many grandchildren
do you have?

11:05.792 --> 11:08.042
Hmm? Oh.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.208
Does it show?

11:09.292 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, in the dark.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.917
Well, that's why
I'm here, you know.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.042
To give them a legacy
from the old man..

11:17.125 --> 11:18.917
...a better world.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.625
And you, any children?

11:21.708 --> 11:23.042
Oh, no, no.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.083
'But family, though, yes?'

11:25.167 --> 11:27.500
No, not anymore.

11:27.583 --> 11:28.958
The war?

11:29.042 --> 11:30.792
Among other things, yes.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.792
So you understand.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.500
Yes, there's been
enough death.

11:37.417 --> 11:39.292
Time for something better.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.500
Well, we must hurry.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.792
Uh.. Ah.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.875
Don't want to keep
anyone waiting.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.250
Captain, picking up a jump point
forming in Sector 39.

11:52.333 --> 11:53.708
That's on the other side
of the planet

11:53.792 --> 11:55.167
where nobody but us can see it.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.958
Yes, sir.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.000
Whoever it is
doesn't want to be noticed.

11:59.083 --> 12:00.208
Opening now.

12:05.208 --> 12:08.167
Reading one Narn heavy cruiser.
She's hailing us.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.917
Put her through.

12:11.542 --> 12:13.500
This is War Leader Na'kal

12:13.583 --> 12:15.667
of the Star Cruiser G'tok.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.125
'Are you Captain Sheridan?'

12:17.208 --> 12:19.958
Yes...if you'll forgive
my saying so

12:20.042 --> 12:23.208
I didn't know any Narn heavy
cruisers had survived the war.

12:23.292 --> 12:26.167
We were on deep patrol,
evaluating potential targets

12:26.250 --> 12:29.333
when the Centauri
struck Homeworld.

12:29.417 --> 12:32.417
Since then, we have been
fighting for our lives.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.208
Alone, without reinforcements

12:34.292 --> 12:38.333
we will eventually be
hunted down and destroyed..

12:38.417 --> 12:40.875
...but with the
support of others

12:40.958 --> 12:44.333
we may one day help
liberate Homeworld.

12:44.417 --> 12:47.667
To achieve that end,
we must remain free

12:47.750 --> 12:50.833
and Babylon 5 is our only hope.

12:50.917 --> 12:54.250
We have expended the last
of our energy in getting here.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.458
We request sanctuary.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.583
[doorbell rings]

13:05.667 --> 13:07.458
Yes.

13:07.542 --> 13:10.292
Commander, I hope
I'm not disturbing you.

13:10.375 --> 13:11.875
No. It's fine.
What can I do for you?

13:11.958 --> 13:14.708
I just thought we could talk
for a moment, informally.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.875
Well, this is about as informal
as I get. Please, have a seat.

13:17.958 --> 13:20.708
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you, no.

13:20.792 --> 13:24.458
Tell me, commander,
are you happy here?

13:24.542 --> 13:27.083
Happy? Yes, I suppose so.

13:27.167 --> 13:28.458
We've been so busy
around here lately

13:28.542 --> 13:29.583
I really haven't
given it much thought.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.042
Oh, I wish you would.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.875
You see I like to know
as much as I possibly can

13:32.958 --> 13:35.667
about the people I work with,
and your record is exemplary.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.333
You've worked your way up
through the ranks

13:37.417 --> 13:39.542
without a patron,
without connections

13:39.625 --> 13:41.208
just through hard work

13:41.292 --> 13:44.542
and now you're a commander on
a high-profile base like this.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.083
'You should be proud.'

13:46.167 --> 13:47.542
Well, thank you.

13:47.625 --> 13:50.625
So, I was wondering what you
thought your next step might be.

13:50.708 --> 13:53.042
Well, for the time being

13:53.125 --> 13:54.667
I'm very happy right here.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.000
Five years down the road..

13:57.083 --> 13:58.417
I don't know.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.708
Maybe running Babylon 5

13:59.792 --> 14:02.583
if the captain
decides to move on.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.083
Although the idea
of captaining a starship

14:05.167 --> 14:07.375
has a certain appeal.

14:07.458 --> 14:08.833
Why?

14:08.917 --> 14:10.167
Well, the Night Watch
is becoming

14:10.250 --> 14:11.958
more important back home.

14:12.042 --> 14:14.042
We have considerable support
within Earthdome.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.917
The way you're going,
I have every confidence

14:16.000 --> 14:18.500
that you'll get that starship
within five years or so

14:18.583 --> 14:22.542
but...why not shave
a year or two off that?

14:22.625 --> 14:24.667
We could do that for you.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.083
In exchange for?

14:26.167 --> 14:28.250
Your support, your help.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.042
Your position here
could benefit us

14:30.125 --> 14:31.708
as much as we can help you.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.958
You have access to
certain information

14:34.042 --> 14:36.000
certain reports
about the comings and goings

14:36.083 --> 14:39.250
of various ships,
people, and cargo

14:39.333 --> 14:41.542
activities which may strike you

14:41.625 --> 14:45.167
as potentially dangerous
or disloyal.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.833
You could be of
great service to Earth.

14:47.917 --> 14:50.000
Does Mr. Lantz
know about this conversation?

14:50.083 --> 14:51.542
No, no, no, no.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.792
The Night Watch is a separate
division of the ministry.

14:54.875 --> 14:57.792
I just thought
we should be discreet.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.042
Of course.

15:00.292 --> 15:01.583
Mr. Wells..

15:03.167 --> 15:04.792
...as you say

15:04.875 --> 15:07.542
I have access
to a great deal of information

15:07.625 --> 15:09.333
so I've been very much aware
of the Night Watch

15:09.417 --> 15:10.833
for some time now.

15:10.917 --> 15:12.708
What I saw worried me.

15:12.792 --> 15:14.500
And now I see that
my worries were justified.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.042
Oh, commander--

15:16.125 --> 15:19.250
I've gotten where I am
through hard work and loyalty.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.167
Loyalty to the people
I work with

15:21.250 --> 15:25.500
loyalty to Earth, and loyalty
to the ideals of the alliance.

15:25.583 --> 15:28.292
What you're asking
violates all three.

15:28.375 --> 15:31.458
Okay, so maybe it takes me a few
more years to get my own ship

15:31.542 --> 15:32.833
but one way or another
I'll get there

15:32.917 --> 15:34.958
and when I do,
I'll have done it honestly

15:35.042 --> 15:38.500
without selling out a friend
or betraying a confidence.

15:38.583 --> 15:41.167
My hands are clean.
Are yours?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.792
[chuckles]

15:42.875 --> 15:46.667
You really don't understand,
but that's alright.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.958
The offer will remain
open indefinitely.

15:50.042 --> 15:51.708
Fine.

15:51.792 --> 15:52.792
Open.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.000
[door opens]

16:04.833 --> 16:08.167
- And no one else knows of this?
- Not yet.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.917
The ship is holding position
on the other side of Epsilon 3

16:11.000 --> 16:12.917
where incoming ships
won't see it.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.917
Since all outside
data comes through here

16:16.000 --> 16:18.125
no one will see it
until we want them to.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.750
Oh, thank you, captain.

16:19.833 --> 16:23.167
This is the first good news I've
had since the occupation began.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.542
Will you give them sanctuary?

16:26.625 --> 16:29.000
I can't see any reason
why not.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.042
Right now we're giving them
equipment to make repairs.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.833
After that's done,
I'll formally notify Mr. Lantz.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.042
Mr. Lantz?

16:35.125 --> 16:37.167
He's here from the
Ministry of Peace back home.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.250
He's looking
into the Centauri problem.

16:39.333 --> 16:42.542
Then Earth is
ready to take sides?

16:42.625 --> 16:44.417
I sure hope so.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.667
Do you think
I could speak to him?

16:45.750 --> 16:47.000
Hmm. I don't see why not.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.417
He'll be in the council chambers
till 7:00.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.792
Thank you, captain.
I'll go and prepare.

16:56.375 --> 16:59.417
[dramatic music]

17:02.333 --> 17:05.833
So this is strictly
an informal meeting.

17:05.917 --> 17:08.250
I'm glad to see
we're adding new members

17:08.333 --> 17:10.083
to the Night Watch

17:10.167 --> 17:12.333
even though I don't recall
seeing any recent reports

17:12.417 --> 17:14.875
from you, Mr. Allen.

17:16.500 --> 17:19.250
Well, there hasn't
been much to report.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.833
How strange.

17:20.917 --> 17:23.250
Your associates
have filed reports.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.667
One of them describes
potentially disloyal acts

17:26.750 --> 17:28.958
on the part of a store owner
in the Zocalo

17:29.042 --> 17:31.542
one Xavier Darabuto?

17:36.875 --> 17:39.625
Well, he said he thought
the new regs on imports

17:39.708 --> 17:41.500
were a little nuts,
but I don't think--

17:41.583 --> 17:43.542
Sedition comes
in small packages

17:43.625 --> 17:45.792
as well as large ones,
Mr. Allen.

17:45.875 --> 17:49.417
Now, perhaps this store owner
is nothing more

17:49.500 --> 17:52.125
than a vaguely
dissatisfied citizen

17:52.208 --> 17:53.875
but how can we tell
the real troublemakers

17:53.958 --> 17:57.000
from the innocent bystanders
unless we're kept informed.

17:57.083 --> 17:59.792
Well, I thought we could
exercise our own discretion.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.417
Of course you can.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.500
But the Night Watch exists
to protect our people

18:04.583 --> 18:06.875
from misinformation
and harmful ideas.

18:06.958 --> 18:09.833
Sometimes those harmful ideas
can be very subtle.

18:09.917 --> 18:13.167
You might not recognize them,
but we will.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.542
I know. I just..

18:14.625 --> 18:17.542
I have reports from the others
on dock workers

18:17.625 --> 18:20.542
consistently late for work,
sabotaging efficiency.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.917
'Several of your lurkers
have spoken to reporters'

18:23.000 --> 18:26.333
about poor conditions here
and at home.

18:26.417 --> 18:29.333
Two more shop owners
have openly criticized

18:29.417 --> 18:30.500
presidential decisions.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.250
Have you nothing to report?

18:35.125 --> 18:38.083
Well, I guess, uh..

18:38.167 --> 18:39.750
I guess I haven't been
thinking in those terms

18:39.833 --> 18:42.750
I'm not sure
I'm really comfortable with it.

18:42.833 --> 18:45.125
Well, let's make it easy
for you, shall we?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.708
Can you verify the report

18:47.792 --> 18:49.708
about the store owner
that I mentioned?

18:49.792 --> 18:51.542
He's already been named,
so you wouldn't be adding

18:51.625 --> 18:54.500
anything new, just confirming
what we already know.

19:02.625 --> 19:03.833
Uh..

19:07.500 --> 19:09.208
I guess, uh..

19:11.167 --> 19:14.208
I mean, yeah,
yeah, I heard him talking

19:14.292 --> 19:15.583
but it's just talk.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.667
That's fine.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.750
There, you see?

19:18.833 --> 19:20.958
That wasn't so bad.

19:21.042 --> 19:24.625
You learn.
You're flexible.

19:24.708 --> 19:27.500
You show great promise,
Mr. Allen.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.125
Great promise, indeed.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.542
[dramatic music]

19:39.125 --> 19:40.417
I brought it.

19:42.083 --> 19:44.417
Wasn't able to get my gun camera
around in time to get a picture

19:44.500 --> 19:46.417
but my sensors
picked up a change

19:46.500 --> 19:48.958
in local hyperspace
when we went by.

19:49.042 --> 19:50.875
It left behind a trail
of neutrino emissions

19:50.958 --> 19:53.667
'like nothing
I've ever seen before.'

19:53.750 --> 19:55.125
It's all here.

19:55.208 --> 19:56.500
Just configure your sensors

19:56.583 --> 19:58.583
to look
for the signature emissions.

19:58.667 --> 20:01.833
If it's there, sooner or later,
you'll find it.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.083
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.000
You go out
looking for that thing

20:07.083 --> 20:09.000
you're looking for death.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.417
From now on,
I've got no part in this.

20:21.958 --> 20:23.958
Well, thank you again,
ambassador.

20:24.042 --> 20:25.875
You've been most helpful.

20:27.833 --> 20:29.625
That covers everyone in the
league of non-aligned worlds.

20:29.708 --> 20:30.958
Yes, I think I'm now ready

20:31.042 --> 20:34.208
to speak with Ambassador Mollari
if you'd take me.

20:34.292 --> 20:36.458
Ah, Commander Ivanova,
I've been looking for you.

20:36.542 --> 20:38.458
I take it this is Mr. Lantz.

20:38.542 --> 20:39.708
Uh, yes, yes.
How can I help you?

20:39.792 --> 20:41.125
This is G'kar

20:41.208 --> 20:43.250
formerly Ambassador G'kar
of the Narn regime.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.042
I understand
you've come here to investigate

20:45.125 --> 20:46.583
the situation with the Centauri.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.375
Uh, well, yes,
within certain guidelines.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.125
If I could speak to you
for just five minutes.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.917
No, I'm afraid that's not
possible at the moment.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.750
- But if you'll just--
- No, I'm sorry.

20:54.833 --> 20:57.375
Maybe later. Commander.

21:02.000 --> 21:02.875
[sighs]

21:02.958 --> 21:04.833
The repairs are going slowly.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.917
With our energy resources
down to almost nothing

21:07.000 --> 21:09.333
our medical systems
are barely functioning.

21:09.417 --> 21:12.000
We are unable to give
proper care and attention

21:12.083 --> 21:13.417
to the sick and wounded.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.333
What if you took your
jump engines off-line?

21:15.417 --> 21:17.292
If we shut down the engines

21:17.375 --> 21:19.792
it would take some time
to reactivate them.

21:19.875 --> 21:23.208
'It would leave us open
and vulnerable to attack.'

21:23.292 --> 21:26.125
As long as you're in Babylon 5
Space, we'll protect you.

21:26.208 --> 21:27.875
You have my word.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.000
Take care of your people.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.792
We will take the engines
off-line now.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.417
Thank you, captain.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.833
(Lantz)
Captain Sheridan.

21:39.917 --> 21:43.000
Uh, Mr. Lantz.
What can I do for you?

21:43.083 --> 21:45.542
I've just received
some very disturbing reports.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.833
And I was hoping you could
shed some light on them.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.875
I understand
you've been conducting

21:49.958 --> 21:51.708
fighter exercises all week.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.750
That's correct. We have to keep
our squads at peak efficiency.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.250
A-and I've heard from Mr. Welles

21:57.333 --> 22:00.375
that you have been using
Centauri combat models.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.083
- How did you find--
- 'That's not important.'

22:02.167 --> 22:03.542
Is it true?

22:03.625 --> 22:05.125
Have you been
teaching your forces

22:05.208 --> 22:06.875
to fight the Centauri?

22:06.958 --> 22:08.333
Well, with everything
that's been going on

22:08.417 --> 22:09.625
it seemed prudent.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.375
No. Now this must stop at once.

22:11.458 --> 22:15.000
This jeopardizes everything,
my entire mission.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.417
I don't understand,
you were sent here

22:16.500 --> 22:17.750
to investigate the Centauri.

22:17.833 --> 22:19.750
Yes, well, I had to
look at the situation

22:19.833 --> 22:21.583
before I could proceed.

22:21.667 --> 22:24.458
However, I'm satisfied
with what I've seen.

22:24.542 --> 22:25.917
I've contacted Earthdome

22:26.000 --> 22:28.375
and they have
authorized me to proceed.

22:28.458 --> 22:29.750
Proceed with what?

22:29.833 --> 22:32.583
I'm here to sign
a non-aggression treaty

22:32.667 --> 22:34.250
with the Centauri.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.792
Before I leave here

22:35.875 --> 22:37.833
there will be
an Earth-Centauri alliance

22:37.917 --> 22:40.417
'that will guarantee
peace for Earth.'

22:40.500 --> 22:45.917
We will, at last
know peace in our time.

22:52.500 --> 22:55.542
[dramatic music]

23:01.250 --> 23:04.250
Mr. Welles, I'm sorry
I missed the meeting

23:04.333 --> 23:07.500
but there's something
you should know.

23:07.583 --> 23:08.958
I can't believe it.

23:09.042 --> 23:11.583
A non-aggression treaty
with the Centauri?

23:11.667 --> 23:14.458
I mean, that's like trying
to make nice with a piranha.

23:14.542 --> 23:16.792
Sooner or later it's gonna
turn around and bite you.

23:16.875 --> 23:18.167
All this does
is get us out of the way

23:18.250 --> 23:20.125
so the Centauri
can move in on the other worlds.

23:20.208 --> 23:21.875
Earth wants peace and they're
willing to sacrifice

23:21.958 --> 23:24.292
everybody else
in order to get it.

23:24.375 --> 23:26.542
You know, I can
remember the first time

23:26.625 --> 23:29.500
I put on this uniform.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.958
I felt ten feet tall

23:32.042 --> 23:35.500
whole
galaxy before breakfast.

23:38.458 --> 23:42.375
Now I look at it,
it's just cloth.

23:42.458 --> 23:45.708
I don't know what it means
anymore, what it stands for.

23:45.792 --> 23:49.042
You know, it's going to be a new
year in little over a week.

23:49.125 --> 23:52.417
Maybe 2260 is the year
that we redefine it

23:52.500 --> 23:54.208
'make it mean
something again.'

23:55.583 --> 23:56.917
Which reminds me..

23:58.708 --> 24:00.042
Merry Christmas.

24:00.125 --> 24:01.583
Happy Hanukkah.
Whatever.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.833
What.. Oh, I-I can't.

24:03.917 --> 24:05.333
Yeah, you can.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.708
Thank you.

24:14.708 --> 24:17.000
Really, I, uh..

24:18.167 --> 24:20.542
I don't really
have one of these.

24:20.625 --> 24:21.625
[clears throat]

24:21.708 --> 24:23.167
[chuckles]

24:23.250 --> 24:24.292
What is it?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.750
It's shrapnel
from the Black Star.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.042
I checked
with the Earthforce archives

24:28.125 --> 24:29.625
they actually had
a few pieces in storage.

24:29.708 --> 24:31.167
Took a little doing
but I managed

24:31.250 --> 24:32.375
to talk them
into giving me one.

24:32.458 --> 24:33.917
Why?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.375
Everyone said
it was impossible to take out

24:35.458 --> 24:39.250
a Minbari war cruiser,
but you did it.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.000
The way things are going, I
figured it would might be nice

24:41.083 --> 24:44.083
to have a reminder that
the impossible is possible.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.583
Captain Sheridan.

24:47.667 --> 24:49.750
I demand to speak
with you at once.

24:49.833 --> 24:51.375
What is it now, ambassador?

24:51.458 --> 24:54.208
I have just been informed
that you have been sheltering

24:54.292 --> 24:56.083
a Narn heavy cruiser.

24:56.167 --> 25:00.708
'You will turn it and its crew
over to us at once.'

25:00.792 --> 25:02.333
I'm sorry, ambassador.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.750
Your signal is breaking up,
I'll have to call you back.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.875
- Captain--
- 'End.'

25:06.958 --> 25:08.042
Run diagnostic.

25:08.125 --> 25:09.125
[beeping]

25:10.375 --> 25:11.667
How the hell did he find out?

25:11.750 --> 25:12.792
It must've been Welles.

25:12.875 --> 25:14.083
He's got people everywhere.

25:14.167 --> 25:15.833
Damn it! Come on.

25:17.333 --> 25:18.917
Londo wouldn't come out
in the open with this

25:19.000 --> 25:20.458
unless he'd already
warned his government.

25:20.542 --> 25:22.083
Company is coming.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.208
Open up a channel
to the Narn ship.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.167
Got to get him out of here fast.

25:28.250 --> 25:30.083
Online.

25:30.167 --> 25:33.250
Na'kal, how long before
your jump engines are repaired?

25:33.333 --> 25:34.750
Not for some time. Why?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.208
The Centauri know you're here.

25:36.292 --> 25:38.083
- Can you navigate at all?
- Yes, but--

25:38.167 --> 25:39.375
Jump point opening.

25:39.458 --> 25:42.500
[dramatic music]

25:49.042 --> 25:50.583
Centauri battle cruiser
is demanding

25:50.667 --> 25:52.958
we turn over the Narn warship
to their custody.

25:53.042 --> 25:55.792
Stand by.
Keep this channel open.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.500
They're taking their position
between us and the jumpgate

25:57.583 --> 25:58.833
blocking the way out.

25:58.917 --> 26:00.333
I've got Ambassador Mollari
on the link.

26:00.417 --> 26:01.750
(Sheridan)
'Stall him.'

26:01.833 --> 26:03.583
I gave him my word
that we would protect them

26:03.667 --> 26:05.625
as long as they're
in our jurisdiction.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.458
I'm not about to
break that promise.

26:08.542 --> 26:11.292
Launch Zeta Squad, tell them
to surround the Narn ship.

26:11.375 --> 26:12.625
Scrambling fighters.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.375
[alarm blaring]

26:14.458 --> 26:17.542
[indistinct clamoring]

26:19.500 --> 26:20.667
Captain.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.250
Captain, what are you doing?
I just heard--

26:23.333 --> 26:25.708
The treaty hasn't been
announced or formalized yet.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.250
I promised them sanctuary.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.333
And once again
you're jeopardizing

26:29.417 --> 26:30.875
everything I've worked for!

26:30.958 --> 26:32.167
I'm sorry.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.750
Will someone please escort
Mr. Lantz

26:33.833 --> 26:35.292
off the command deck?

26:35.375 --> 26:37.125
(Ivanova)
'Zeta Squadron
ready for launch.'

26:37.208 --> 26:38.208
Launch.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.458
[whooshing]

26:51.083 --> 26:53.333
Put Ambassador Mollari through.

26:56.458 --> 26:57.667
Captain Sheridan.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.833
The Narn warship
is under my protection.

26:59.917 --> 27:02.042
I have guaranteed
the right of free passage.

27:02.125 --> 27:05.125
Once its engines are repaired
it will leave Babylon 5 space.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.875
After that,
it's no business of ours.

27:07.958 --> 27:10.208
'I've assigned a squad of
fighters to escort the cruiser'

27:10.292 --> 27:12.792
'safely out of Babylon 5 space.'

27:12.875 --> 27:15.833
You tell your cruiser
to withdraw at once.

27:15.917 --> 27:17.708
They open fire
on any of our fighters

27:17.792 --> 27:20.125
I will respond
with deadly force.

27:20.833 --> 27:21.958
End.

27:25.583 --> 27:27.375
Send a copy
of that last transmission

27:27.458 --> 27:28.875
to the Centauri Battle Cruiser

27:28.958 --> 27:30.792
then activate defense grid.

27:32.042 --> 27:35.125
[instrumental music]

27:37.792 --> 27:39.083
Our fighters are in position.

27:39.167 --> 27:40.875
Can you move
toward the jumpgate?

27:40.958 --> 27:42.625
Yes, but not very quickly.

27:42.708 --> 27:44.292
(Sheridan)
'Give me the best you can.'

27:46.417 --> 27:49.500
[dramatic music]

27:53.958 --> 27:56.417
Centauri Battle Cruiser
is changing position

27:56.500 --> 27:57.917
'moving to intercept.'

27:58.000 --> 27:59.583
'Weapons system is active'

27:59.667 --> 28:01.250
gun ports are open.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.583
Are they targeting our fighters?

28:02.667 --> 28:04.708
Targeting the Narn vessel

28:04.792 --> 28:07.750
Zeta Squadron...and us.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.750
Return the favor.
Target their ship.

28:09.833 --> 28:11.083
(Ivanova)
'Targeting, aye.'

28:13.500 --> 28:16.875
Zeta Squadron, stand by.
Continue escorting her out.

28:16.958 --> 28:19.000
If you are fired upon,
return fire.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.083
- 'Fire at will.'
- Confirmed, Babylon Control.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.583
Heat 'em up, people.

28:23.667 --> 28:25.167
Close blast doors.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.750
(male #3)
'Centauri Weapons System
locking on.'

28:31.667 --> 28:34.333
They're trying to provoke us
into making the first move.

28:34.417 --> 28:37.125
- I don't think so.
- They got an energy spike.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.292
Oh, hell.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.667
[gunfire]

28:41.708 --> 28:43.208
Interceptors, fire!

28:46.125 --> 28:48.208
[gunfire continues]

28:50.042 --> 28:51.958
Zeta One through Five,
break and attack.

28:52.042 --> 28:53.917
'Everybody else with me.'

28:57.542 --> 28:59.458
Interceptors running hot.

28:59.542 --> 29:01.292
Ninety percent capacity
and dropping.

29:01.375 --> 29:02.500
They're getting through.

29:03.250 --> 29:06.333
[gunfire continues]

29:10.667 --> 29:11.875
[yells]

29:13.917 --> 29:16.625
Launch everything we've got!
Time on target.

29:16.708 --> 29:19.000
Time on target, aye.
Hold on.

29:19.083 --> 29:22.125
[gunfire]

29:30.083 --> 29:33.125
[intense music]

29:42.000 --> 29:43.833
Registering massive damage
to Centauri vessel.

29:43.917 --> 29:46.208
Scramble all medical ships.
There's still time.

29:46.292 --> 29:47.500
It's too late.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.875
[explosion]

29:50.958 --> 29:52.208
Oh, my God.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.583
[music continues]

30:06.042 --> 30:07.625
The Centauri are furious
over this incident.

30:07.708 --> 30:09.208
What was I supposed to do

30:09.292 --> 30:11.583
stand by and let them
blow this place to bits?

30:11.667 --> 30:13.208
You destroyed
a Centauri warship!

30:13.292 --> 30:14.958
You're damn straight!

30:15.042 --> 30:16.500
And if I hadn't,
you and I wouldn't be here

30:16.583 --> 30:18.083
to have this conversation.

30:18.167 --> 30:20.750
They fired first, Mr. Lantz.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.750
I have an obligation
to protect this station.

30:22.833 --> 30:26.083
You had no business
helping a Narn cruiser.

30:26.167 --> 30:27.792
Are you telling me
to disobey regulations?

30:27.875 --> 30:29.750
What regulations?

30:29.833 --> 30:33.000
General order 47,
Earthforce personnel

30:33.083 --> 30:35.208
are required
to answer distress calls

30:35.292 --> 30:37.583
and assist any vessel

30:37.667 --> 30:41.250
not currently involved
in hostilities against Earth.

30:41.333 --> 30:44.292
'Now, it may not have been
politically convenient'

30:44.375 --> 30:47.583
but morally and legally
it was the right decision.

30:47.667 --> 30:51.792
The Centauri Government
accuses you of moving Babylon 5

30:51.875 --> 30:55.125
from neutrality
to a pro-Narn position.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.875
If I may interject.

30:56.958 --> 30:59.458
Captain Sheridan
is correct in his assessment.

30:59.542 --> 31:02.417
He acted in accord
with Earthforce regulations.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.750
I've spoken
with the joint chiefs

31:03.833 --> 31:05.250
'and they support his actions.'

31:05.333 --> 31:06.250
Thank you.

31:06.333 --> 31:07.917
However, the decisions

31:08.000 --> 31:10.500
leading up to those actions
are another matter entirely.

31:10.583 --> 31:13.083
Had we been informed as soon
as the Narn cruiser appeared

31:13.167 --> 31:15.583
there would've been time
to inform the Centauri.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.042
Who wouldn't have had to find
out about it second-hand.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.958
In the spirit
of our newly formed treaty

31:20.042 --> 31:22.167
we then could've turned
over the warship

31:22.250 --> 31:24.292
while allowing
the crew itself sanctuary.

31:24.375 --> 31:25.958
They wouldn't have cooperated

31:26.042 --> 31:28.292
they'd have just shown up
earlier and done the same thing.

31:28.375 --> 31:29.667
You can't reason with them.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.375
Now, you're quite
wrong there, captain.

31:31.458 --> 31:32.708
We have reasoned with them

31:32.792 --> 31:35.667
and they've shown
great patience.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.792
Now, despite their loss,
and given the fact

31:37.875 --> 31:40.708
that their ship did fire first

31:40.792 --> 31:42.917
they're willing
to drop the whole matter

31:43.000 --> 31:44.458
in exchange for an apology.

31:44.542 --> 31:47.292
Apologize for doing my job?
Like hell.

31:47.375 --> 31:48.833
(Welles)
'This isn't a request, captain.'

31:48.917 --> 31:52.583
It's a direct order from the
joint chiefs and the president.

31:52.667 --> 31:55.500
Now, you have
two choices, apologize

31:55.583 --> 31:58.000
or disobey a direct order
from your superiors.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.000
As this would be an
act of insubordination

32:00.083 --> 32:02.042
you would be removed
from your position

32:02.125 --> 32:05.125
and someone more...reasonable

32:05.208 --> 32:07.375
would be installed
to replace you.

32:08.917 --> 32:11.500
We've arranged for a meeting
of the various ambassadors

32:11.583 --> 32:13.875
in one hour, in the Zen Garden.

32:13.958 --> 32:15.583
As settings go,
it's better suited

32:15.667 --> 32:19.042
to offering the olive branch
and more public.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.125
[scoffs]

32:21.917 --> 32:24.250
I suppose this, uh..

32:24.333 --> 32:27.250
...apology is already written.

32:27.333 --> 32:31.000
No need. You can phrase
the apology any way you see fit.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.083
As with everything else

32:33.167 --> 32:35.125
it's the thought that counts.

32:37.208 --> 32:38.667
(female #2)
'Zeta leader, any idea how long'

32:38.750 --> 32:40.000
'we're supposed to stay
with this thing?'

32:40.083 --> 32:41.750
Just until she's clear
of another gate

32:41.833 --> 32:43.917
and we're sure
nobody is following us.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.750
[computer beeping]

32:45.833 --> 32:48.250
Computer, what have you got?

32:48.333 --> 32:51.375
[automated message]
'Registering unusual changes
in local hyperspace'

32:51.458 --> 32:54.500
'matching provided
specifications.'

32:54.583 --> 32:57.375
'Neutrino emissions up
eight percent.'

32:58.292 --> 33:00.042
This is Zeta leader.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.250
Breaking off
to investigate something.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.667
Stay on course.
I'll catch up.

33:04.750 --> 33:05.917
(female #2)
'Confirmed.'

33:12.292 --> 33:13.583
[sighs]

33:13.667 --> 33:15.042
[clears throat]

33:16.167 --> 33:17.708
I apologize.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.375
I'm sorry.

33:25.542 --> 33:28.292
I'm sorry we had to
defend ourselves

33:28.375 --> 33:31.125
against an unwarranted attack.

33:31.208 --> 33:33.458
I'm sorry that your crew
was stupid enough

33:33.542 --> 33:34.750
to fire on a station

33:34.833 --> 33:36.917
filled with a quarter
million civilians

33:37.000 --> 33:39.542
including your own people.

33:39.625 --> 33:41.500
And I'm sorry
I waited as long as I did

33:41.583 --> 33:44.208
before I blew them all
straight to hell.

33:53.583 --> 33:55.667
As with everything else..

33:57.292 --> 33:59.375
...it's the thought that counts.

34:08.958 --> 34:12.000
[computer beeping]

34:14.250 --> 34:16.167
Gotcha.

34:16.250 --> 34:18.458
Computer,
follow unidentified ship.

34:18.542 --> 34:20.167
Begin recording.

[chatter continues]

35:15.667 --> 35:18.167
G'kar, you shouldn't be here.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.000
I heard what happened.

35:20.083 --> 35:22.542
I thought if I spoke
on Sheridan's behalf.

35:22.625 --> 35:24.125
That may not be wise.

35:24.208 --> 35:27.542
I still have a few supporters in
the league, they would listen.

35:30.542 --> 35:33.167
[automated message]
'Being scanned
by unidentified ship.'

35:33.250 --> 35:35.083
'Changing course.'

35:35.167 --> 35:36.958
Attach homing beacon
and eject system record.

35:42.417 --> 35:44.333
[screaming]

35:44.417 --> 35:47.958
(man on PA)
Welcome to Coretrans.
Please watch your step.

35:48.042 --> 35:50.375
This is a low gravity area.

35:50.458 --> 35:53.917
Please hold handrails
at all times.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.125
[speaking in foreign language]

36:37.125 --> 36:39.250
(woman on PA)
Approaching station two.

36:39.333 --> 36:41.542
Please stand away
from the doors.

36:46.125 --> 36:49.167
[music continues]

36:51.458 --> 36:54.542
[indistinct chatter]

37:09.708 --> 37:12.125
[beeping]

37:12.208 --> 37:13.875
Computer, emergency override.

37:13.958 --> 37:15.583
Open shuttle doors!

37:20.167 --> 37:21.958
[beeping]

37:22.042 --> 37:23.292
[explosion]

37:23.375 --> 37:24.708
[indistinct chatter]

37:24.792 --> 37:26.708
In Valen's name.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.625
Oh, my God.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.333
Emergency alert. We've had an
explosion in the core shuttle.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.875
We need rescue jet packs,
and we need 'em now.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.042
What are you trying to do?

37:34.125 --> 37:35.500
He's is more or less weightless

37:35.583 --> 37:37.167
but the ground is rotating
at 60 miles an hour

37:37.250 --> 37:38.833
if we can't catch him
he'll be killed by the impact.

37:38.917 --> 37:40.292
But you won't have time.

37:43.417 --> 37:45.708
Kosh, you know
what is at stake.

37:45.792 --> 37:49.333
If you're going to do anything,
you must do it now.

37:49.417 --> 37:52.458
[beeping]

37:54.792 --> 37:56.458
(female #3)
'Suiting up. We'll get there
in two minutes.'

37:56.542 --> 37:58.333
We don't have two minutes,
you've got 30 seconds.

37:58.417 --> 38:00.083
(female #3)
'We can't do it.'

38:02.125 --> 38:04.917
[instrumental music]

38:06.625 --> 38:08.042
Valaria!

38:08.125 --> 38:09.708
Droshalla.

38:11.083 --> 38:12.708
G'lan.

38:14.500 --> 38:17.583
[music continues]

38:47.500 --> 38:50.583
[music continues]

39:01.833 --> 39:03.292
Kosh?

39:24.500 --> 39:25.542
[doorbell rings]

39:25.625 --> 39:26.750
Yes?

39:29.333 --> 39:31.375
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

39:31.458 --> 39:34.042
Fine. Fine.

39:34.125 --> 39:36.750
The whole station is talking
about what happened.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.583
Every race that was in the
garden saw something different

39:39.667 --> 39:41.958
yet...the same.

39:42.042 --> 39:43.542
A being of light.

39:43.625 --> 39:45.333
Yes.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.583
Each according
to his or her type.

39:47.667 --> 39:50.208
But it was Kosh, wasn't it?

39:52.208 --> 39:53.458
That's what he meant
when he said

39:53.542 --> 39:55.458
that if he left
his encounter suit

39:55.542 --> 39:58.833
he'd be recognized by everybody.

39:58.917 --> 40:00.250
For millions of years

40:00.333 --> 40:02.167
the Vorlons have visited
other worlds

40:02.250 --> 40:03.417
guided them, and, uh..

40:03.500 --> 40:05.917
Manipulated us?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.750
Programmed us so that
when we saw them

40:08.833 --> 40:11.042
we would react the right way?

40:11.125 --> 40:14.708
It is, as you say,
a matter of perspective.

40:14.792 --> 40:17.000
What matters is that
he has revealed himself

40:17.083 --> 40:18.458
to those who understand

40:18.542 --> 40:22.125
you, me, and those
who have been watching.

40:23.458 --> 40:26.167
The shadows will know
what Kosh has done.

40:26.250 --> 40:29.500
They will worry, afraid that
he would not reveal himself

40:29.583 --> 40:32.333
unless the Vorlons were prepared
to stand against them.

40:32.417 --> 40:35.833
- Are they?
- I do not think so.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.583
But as long as
the shadows believe

40:37.667 --> 40:40.500
the rest of us are unaware
of their existence

40:40.583 --> 40:42.750
we have time to prepare.

40:42.833 --> 40:46.000
Then I just hope that nobody
finds out about them until..

40:46.083 --> 40:48.833
Captain,
Zeta Squad just got back.

40:48.917 --> 40:50.375
Lieutenant Keffer is missing.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.792
[dramatic music]

40:54.208 --> 40:56.917
It was G'lan.
I saw him with my own eyes.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.625
He swooped down
as was told in the old stories.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.625
No. Not G'lan.

41:01.708 --> 41:04.958
Droshalla, whose light
fills the world.

41:05.042 --> 41:08.917
Doesn't matter. It was a good
sign for the coming year.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.625
This place has been blessed.

41:15.167 --> 41:18.792
And you, Ambassador Mollari,
what did you see?

41:22.500 --> 41:23.875
Nothing.

41:26.125 --> 41:27.625
I saw..

41:29.042 --> 41:30.292
...nothing.

41:37.250 --> 41:39.708
(Ivanova)
It was the end
of the Earth year 2259.

41:39.792 --> 41:42.708
And the war was upon us.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.417
As anticipated,
a few days after

41:44.500 --> 41:46.458
the Earth-Centauri treaty
was announced

41:46.542 --> 41:47.958
the Centauri widened their war

41:48.042 --> 41:51.167
to include many
of the non-aligned worlds.

41:51.250 --> 41:53.667
And there was another war
brewing closer to home.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.500
A personal one
whose cost would be higher

41:55.583 --> 41:57.667
than any of us could imagine.

41:57.750 --> 42:00.833
[indistinct chatter]

42:17.625 --> 42:20.542
(Ivanova)
We came to this place
because Babylon 5 was our last

42:20.625 --> 42:22.583
best hope for peace.

42:22.667 --> 42:26.542
By the end of 2259,
we knew that it had failed.

42:26.625 --> 42:29.125
But in so doing,
it became something greater.

42:29.208 --> 42:33.792
As the war expanded, it became
our last best hope for victory.

42:33.875 --> 42:37.917
Because sometimes peace
is another word for surrender

42:38.000 --> 42:40.958
and because secrets
have a way of getting out.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.292

'When our ship encountered
a distress beacon'

42:46.375 --> 42:48.500
