As we steer our boat down,

00:37.328 --> 00:40.763
looking for these
dangerous predators.

00:40.765 --> 00:42.598
Boy, there's a king 'croc
right there!

00:42.600 --> 00:46.268
He must be four meters,
12-13 feet long at least.

00:46.270 --> 00:48.137
This 'croc has enough
power in his jaws

00:48.139 --> 00:50.339
to rip my head
right off.
( mumbling )

00:50.341 --> 00:51.507
I've got to
be careful.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.275
So what I'm gonna do
is sneak up on him,

00:53.277 --> 00:55.244
and jam my thumb in
his butthole.

00:55.246 --> 00:56.378
HOLY CRAP, DUDE!

00:56.380 --> 00:57.546
If I get
bit out here,

00:57.548 --> 00:59.548
I'm 200 kilometers from
the nearest hospital.

00:59.550 --> 01:00.883
I better be
real careful

01:00.885 --> 01:03.819
jamming my thumb
in its butthole.

01:03.821 --> 01:06.121
Oh, boy he's
pissed off now.

01:06.123 --> 01:06.822
GO, DUDE, GO!

01:06.824 --> 01:09.491
I'm gonna jam my thumb
in his butthole now!

01:09.493 --> 01:11.493
This should really
piss it off.

01:11.495 --> 01:14.563
Oh, yeah, that
pissed it off alright!

01:14.565 --> 01:15.798
I've got to
be careful!

01:15.800 --> 01:16.632
THIS GUY RULES!

01:16.634 --> 01:18.200
( mumbling )
I TOLD YOU GUYS.

01:18.202 --> 01:20.669
Well, that was
quite an angry 'croc,

01:20.671 --> 01:23.372
but I managed to escape
with only a few bruises

01:23.374 --> 01:24.707
and a shattered
left testicle.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.276
Next week we'll look
for more of these
beautiful creatures

01:27.278 --> 01:28.744
so we can learn
more about them

01:28.746 --> 01:30.412
by pissing
them off immensely.

01:30.414 --> 01:31.113
Thanks for watching.

01:31.115 --> 01:33.182
DUDE, LET'S GO
LOOK FOR CROCODILES.

01:33.184 --> 01:34.616
YEAH.

01:34.919 --> 01:37.686
( Cartman )
THERE'S BOUND TO BE
SOME CROCODILES HERE.

01:37.688 --> 01:40.222
I'LL USE MY 'CROC CALL
TO TRY BRING THEM IN.

01:40.224 --> 01:41.857
BLADAH-DAH,
BLADAH-DAH...

01:41.859 --> 01:44.960
THAT'S NOT HOW
A 'CROC SOUNDS,
YOU FAT-ASS PENIS!

01:44.962 --> 01:46.628
NOW I'M GONNA KICK
MY FRIEND KYLE

01:46.630 --> 01:48.997
IN THE BEAN BAG AND SEE
WHAT HAPPENS, BY CRIKEY!

01:48.999 --> 01:50.566
GET AWAY FROM ME,
CARTMAN!

01:50.568 --> 01:51.967
COME HERE, CROCKY.

01:51.969 --> 01:54.937
AHH!

01:54.939 --> 01:55.904
DUDE!

01:55.906 --> 01:57.272
HELP! UHH!

01:57.274 --> 01:59.708
GOOD JOB, CARTMAN,
YOU KILLED KYLE.

01:59.710 --> 02:00.676
( mumbling )

02:00.678 --> 02:01.744
WELL, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE CALLED ME FAT.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.979
WHY THE HELL NOT? THAT'S LIKE
CALLING THE SKY BLUE.

02:03.981 --> 02:06.281
WELL, SCREW HIM,
LET'S GO LOOK
FOR CROCODILES.

02:06.283 --> 02:07.049
( Kyle )
YOU GUYS!

02:07.051 --> 02:09.318
HE'S STILL ALIVE.
KYLE, ARE YOU OKAY?

02:09.320 --> 02:11.754
I THINK SO.
IS CARTMAN UP THERE?

02:11.756 --> 02:12.621
I'M RIGHT
HERE, KYLE.

02:12.623 --> 02:15.991
CARTMAN, YOU FUCKING
HUNK OF FAT, RAT BUCKET--

02:15.993 --> 02:18.927
OH, YEAH? OH, YEAH?
SAY THAT TO MY FACE,
PUSSY!

02:18.929 --> 02:20.429
CAN YOU CLIMB
BACK UP, DUDE?

02:20.431 --> 02:21.196
I DON'T THINK SO.

02:21.198 --> 02:22.398
DAMMIT, I GUESS
I HAVE TO GO GET HIM.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.934
NO, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET'S LOOK FOR
CROCODILES.

02:28.706 --> 02:31.373
WHOA, DUDE, THIS
IS MAKING ME SICK.

02:32.042 --> 02:33.275
SICK, DUDE.

02:33.277 --> 02:34.376
SORRY.

02:34.378 --> 02:35.778
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING, FAT BOY?

02:35.780 --> 02:36.712
( Cartman )
SCREW YOU, HIPPY!

02:36.714 --> 02:38.280
COME ON, DUDE, I WANT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

02:38.282 --> 02:39.348
ALL RIGHT, JUST
GRAB THE ROPE.

02:39.350 --> 02:42.117
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THIS?

02:44.822 --> 02:46.321
AHH!
AHH!

02:46.924 --> 02:48.924
DUDE, IT'S A DUDE!

02:48.926 --> 02:50.259
HE'S LIKE SOME
FROZEN GUY.

02:50.261 --> 02:52.728
( Cartman )
COME ON, YOU GUYS,
IT'S GETTING COLD UP HERE.

02:52.730 --> 02:54.196
SHUT UP,
CARTMAN.

02:54.198 --> 02:55.431
DUDE, I SAW THIS
IN A MOVIE ONCE.

02:55.433 --> 02:56.465
THE OLD CAVEMEN
GET FROZEN,

02:56.467 --> 02:57.599
AND THEN PEOPLE
DISCOVER THEM

02:57.601 --> 02:59.101
AND MAKE THEM
THEIR CAVEMAN FRIEND.

02:59.103 --> 02:59.902
WOW, COOL.

02:59.904 --> 03:02.404
YOU GUYS, THERE'S A FROZEN
APE MAN FROM THE PAST
DOWN HERE.

03:02.406 --> 03:03.872
SEND SOME MORE ROPE.
REALLY?

03:03.874 --> 03:05.374
HEY, THERE'S A
FROZEN GUY DOWN THERE.

03:05.376 --> 03:07.342
HELP ME CHIP SOME
OF THE ICE AWAY.

03:07.344 --> 03:08.377
( Cartman )
HEY, YOU GUYS,

03:08.379 --> 03:09.578
THIS IS JUST LIKE
THAT ONE MOVIE,

03:09.580 --> 03:11.847
AND JOHN TRAVOLTA AND
THAT FRENCH CHICK

03:11.849 --> 03:13.449
WERE DOING IT
ALL SUMMER LONG,

03:13.451 --> 03:14.850
AND THEY WENT
BACK TO SCHOOL

03:14.852 --> 03:16.351
AND SANG SONGS ABOUT
GREASED LIGHTNING.

03:16.353 --> 03:19.288
YOU KNOW, THAT MOVIE,
THE SANDRA DEE CHICK

03:19.290 --> 03:20.522
IS ALL PRISSY...

03:20.524 --> 03:23.959
( together )
CARTMAN, WILL YOU
SHUT THE HELL UP

03:23.961 --> 03:25.394
AND GET SOME
MORE ROPE?

03:25.396 --> 03:26.428
AH, SCREW YOU
GUYS, ANYWAY!

03:26.430 --> 03:28.363
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN
THAT KID FOUND A WALLET,
AND HE GOT A REWARD?

03:28.365 --> 03:31.767
YEAH, SWEET. MAYBE WE CAN GET
A REWARD FOR THE FROZEN GUY.

03:31.769 --> 03:32.668
HOORAY!
HOORAY!

03:32.670 --> 03:34.536
( Cartman )
HOORAY.

03:37.708 --> 03:40.042
( Stan )
WHERE SHOULD WE BRING HIM?

03:40.044 --> 03:41.343
( Kyle )
I DON'T KNOW.

03:41.345 --> 03:42.311
WE JUST HAVE TO
GET IT TO TOWN

03:42.313 --> 03:43.579
AND THEN LET THEM FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

03:43.581 --> 03:44.746
I THINK I'M GONNA
NAME IT GORAC.

03:44.748 --> 03:45.914
NO, DUDE, WE HAVE
TO NAME IT STEVE.

03:45.916 --> 03:47.816
STEVE? WHAT THE HELL KIND OF
CAVEMAN NAME IS STEVE?

03:47.818 --> 03:49.284
IT'S MY NAME,
AND I FOUND HIM.

03:49.286 --> 03:50.452
YOU DIDN'T FIND HIM,
I FOUND HIM.

03:50.454 --> 03:51.854
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, DUDE?

03:51.856 --> 03:53.455
I FELL DOWN THAT ABYSS
AND THERE IT WAS.

03:53.457 --> 03:54.890
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
EVEN NOTICED IT

03:54.892 --> 03:56.024
IF I HADN'T
POINTED IT OUT.

03:56.026 --> 03:57.426
KENNY, WHO FOUND
THE ICEMAN?

03:57.428 --> 03:58.427
( mumbling )

03:58.429 --> 04:00.596
I THINK WE'RE ALMOST
THERE, YOU GUYS.

04:00.598 --> 04:03.432
( mayor )
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS

04:03.434 --> 04:05.234
IS A VERY
SERIOUS MATTER.

04:05.236 --> 04:06.568
WE NEED TO VOTE ON
WHETHER SOUTH PARK

04:06.570 --> 04:09.004
SHOULD REINSTATE
THE DEATH PENALTY OR NOT.

04:09.006 --> 04:11.006
ALL THOSE IN
FAVOR, SAY "YIPPY".

04:11.008 --> 04:11.607
YIPPY!
YIPPY!

04:11.609 --> 04:13.876
WAIT, WHAT WAS THAT?
I MISSED THE QUESTION.

04:13.878 --> 04:14.676
YIPPY.

04:14.678 --> 04:16.311
ALL THOSE
OPPOSE SAY "NAY".

04:16.313 --> 04:18.647
NAY.
NAY.
SCREW YOU!

04:18.649 --> 04:20.516
HEY, SCREW YOU!

04:20.518 --> 04:21.550
EXCUSE ME.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.451
NOT NOW, KIDS,

04:22.453 --> 04:24.386
THE TOWN IS HAVING
A VERY IMPORTANT DEBATE

04:24.388 --> 04:26.188
ON CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT.

04:26.190 --> 04:29.558
BUT WE FOUND A FROZEN
ICEMAN FROM THE PAST.

04:29.994 --> 04:31.860
I FOUND THIS FROZEN GUY
IN THE WOODS TODAY.

04:31.862 --> 04:33.896
NO, I FOUND THIS FROZEN GUY
IN THE WOODS TODAY.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.797
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

04:35.799 --> 04:37.099
WE CAME FOR
OUR REWARD.

04:37.101 --> 04:38.567
YEAH, LIKE THE KID
WITH THE WALLET.

04:38.569 --> 04:39.334
REWARD,
WHAT REWARD?

04:39.336 --> 04:41.970
MAYOR, I THINK THE BOYS
MAY HAVE STUMBLED ON
TO SOMETHING HERE.

04:41.972 --> 04:44.039
YOU SEE, MAYOR, FROZEN
LINKS ARE OFTEN FOUND.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.073
DINOSAUR EGGS,
WOOLLY MAMMOTHS...

04:45.075 --> 04:47.876
THIS SPECIMEN COULD
BE A MISSING LINK
IN OUR EVOLUTION.

04:47.878 --> 04:50.045
IF I CAN UNFREEZE THE BODY
AND PERFORM AN AUTOPSY,

04:50.047 --> 04:52.848
I COULD LEARN MUCH ABOUT
THIS CREATURE'S PEOPLE
AND ITS TIME.

04:52.850 --> 04:55.751
SURE, SURE, SURE, BE MY GUEST,
KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.

04:55.753 --> 04:56.818
THANK YOU,
MAYOR.

04:56.820 --> 04:58.120
OH, AND, BOYS,

04:58.122 --> 04:59.655
I CAN'T GIVE YOU A REWARD
FOR FINDING THIS CREATURE.

04:59.657 --> 05:01.056
BUT IF YOU'D LIKE,
I'LL LET YOU NAME HIM.

05:01.058 --> 05:02.791
REALLY?
SWEET! HOW ABOUT STEVE?

05:02.793 --> 05:03.425
STEVE IT IS.

05:03.427 --> 05:04.493
WAIT A MINUTE,
HIS NAME IS GORAC.

05:04.495 --> 05:06.728
COME ON, STEVE,
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

05:06.730 --> 05:08.997
UNFREEZING THIS BODY WILL
BE QUITE DELICATE WORK.

05:08.999 --> 05:12.100
WE'LL HAVE TO USE THE MOST
ADVANCED METHODS AVAILABLE.

05:15.472 --> 05:16.805
THIS IS VERY
EXCITING.

05:16.807 --> 05:17.773
HE COULD BE
A NEANDERTHAL,

05:17.775 --> 05:21.043
OR AN AUSTRALOPITHECUS
FROM THE PALEOITHIC ERA.

05:22.513 --> 05:23.779
DO YOU SEE THAT,
KEVIN?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.013
THESE CLOTHES ARE
FROM EDDIE BAUER.

05:25.015 --> 05:27.916
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY
WEAR CLOTHES FROM EDDIE BAUER

05:27.918 --> 05:32.054
SINCE...1996.

05:33.090 --> 05:34.256
THIS IS
INCREDIBLE.

05:34.258 --> 05:35.757
THINK OF ALL WE CAN
LEARN FROM THIS BODY.

05:35.759 --> 05:36.992
ALL THAT IT
CAN TEACH US.

05:36.994 --> 05:39.695
LET'S JUST HOPE THE PRESS
DOESN'T GET WIND OF THIS
RIGHT AWAY.

05:39.697 --> 05:42.531
STAND BACK, PEOPLE,
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.733
WHAT ABOUT THE PREHISTORIC
ICEMAN?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.802
OH, YEAH,
THERE IS THAT.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.003
DR. MEPHISTO,

05:48.005 --> 05:49.071
COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL US WHAT'S
GOING ON?

05:49.073 --> 05:51.440
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE STILL HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

05:51.442 --> 05:54.743
BUT IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS
MAN'S BEEN FROZEN IN TIME

05:54.745 --> 05:57.045
FOR OVER 32 MONTHS.

05:57.047 --> 05:58.780
OH!
YES, IT'S TRUE.

05:58.782 --> 05:59.881
ALTHOUGH
AT THIS EARLY STAGE

05:59.883 --> 06:01.483
WE KNOW VERY LITTLE
ABOUT THIS MAN

06:01.485 --> 06:02.751
OR THE TIME FROM
WHICH HE COMES.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.319
Fascinating news tonight
from South Park.

06:04.321 --> 06:06.254
An ancient discovery
of a prehistoric man

06:06.256 --> 06:07.623
actually frozen
in ice.

06:07.625 --> 06:11.093
A team of scientists continues
to try and unfreeze the body

06:11.095 --> 06:12.728
so that it can be
autopsied and studied.

06:12.730 --> 06:15.364
The caveman was discovered
by Kyle Broslovski,

06:15.366 --> 06:16.932
who had
this to say.

06:16.934 --> 06:18.767
Well, I fell down
this ice cavern...

06:18.769 --> 06:22.304
La, la, la, la!

06:22.306 --> 06:24.139
The prehistoric iceman
is thought to be

06:24.141 --> 06:25.574
from the late
neo-post-Jurassic era,

06:25.576 --> 06:29.244
where he was probably part of
a hunting and gathering tribe

06:29.246 --> 06:31.913
that lived on
Waterston Street.

06:32.950 --> 06:33.915
THAT'S IT, KEVIN.

06:33.917 --> 06:36.318
NOW WE CAN
BEGIN THE AUTOPSY.

06:36.320 --> 06:38.754
HUH, WHAT'S THIS?

06:38.756 --> 06:39.621
HOLY CRAP,
HE'S ALIVE?

06:39.623 --> 06:42.958
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
DO AN EKG ON HIM.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.192
MY GOD, HE REALLY
IS ALIVE.

06:44.194 --> 06:45.494
THE ICE MUST HAVE
PRESERVED HIM.

06:45.496 --> 06:46.828
WELL, QUICK,
DO SOMETHING.

06:46.830 --> 06:48.130
NO, WE'VE GOT TO
THINK THIS THROUGH.

06:48.132 --> 06:49.564
MAYOR, THIS MAN HAS
NOT BEEN CONSCIOUS

06:49.566 --> 06:50.966
FOR ALMOST
THREE YEARS.

06:50.968 --> 06:52.134
HE WON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE SEES.

06:52.136 --> 06:53.235
HE'LL BE FRIGHTENED
AND CONFUSED.

06:53.237 --> 06:54.970
WELL, YOU CAN'T
JUST LET HIM DIE.

06:54.972 --> 06:57.172
PERHAPS DEATH IS BETTER
THAN THE SHOCK HE WILL TAKE

06:57.174 --> 06:58.106
TRYING TO ADAPT
TO OUR TIME.

06:58.108 --> 07:02.244
OH, MY GOODNESS, IT LOOKS AS IF
HE'S ABOUT TO SPEAK.

07:02.246 --> 07:04.079
WHERE AM I?

07:04.081 --> 07:06.148
WHAT?
WHAT'S HE SAYING?
IS THAT ENGLISH?

07:06.150 --> 07:07.616
WHAT? YOU'RE HUNGRY?

07:07.618 --> 07:10.185
WHERE AM I?
YOU'RE-YOU'RE HUNGRY?

07:10.187 --> 07:11.119
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:11.121 --> 07:15.657
ME FRIEND. FRIEND.
ME FRIEND.

07:15.659 --> 07:19.327
ME-PHIS-TO.
ME-PHIS-TO.

07:19.329 --> 07:19.828
HUH?

07:19.830 --> 07:21.196
IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S SAYING,

07:21.198 --> 07:22.330
THEN MAYBE WE CAN
GET SOME ANSWERS.

07:22.332 --> 07:24.232
IF ONLY THERE WAS
SOMEONE WHO COULD
COMMUNICATE WITH HIM

07:24.234 --> 07:25.701
ON A LEVEL AS
PRIMITIVE AS HIS OWN.

07:25.703 --> 07:27.703
A MIND LIKE...
A CHILD.

07:27.705 --> 07:29.337
( Stan )
DUDE, I WANTED
TO CALL HIM GORAC.

07:29.339 --> 07:30.505
GORAC'S A GAY NAME.

07:30.507 --> 07:31.306
NO, IT ISN'T.

07:31.308 --> 07:32.541
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SUCH A DICK?

07:32.543 --> 07:34.209
I'M NOT BE A DICK,
YOU'RE BEING A DICK.

07:34.211 --> 07:35.477
HELLO, CHILDREN,

07:35.479 --> 07:36.845
DR. MEPHISTO
NEEDS ONE OF YOU

07:36.847 --> 07:37.879
TO HELP HIM OUT
IN HIS LAB

07:37.881 --> 07:40.082
WITH THE PREHISTORIC
ICEMAN.

07:40.084 --> 07:40.982
I'LL GO.

07:40.984 --> 07:41.983
NO, I'LL GO,
I FOUND HIM.

07:41.985 --> 07:43.385
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
GUYS FIGHT LIKE THIS.

07:43.387 --> 07:45.587
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S ONLY
ONE FAIR WAY TO DO THIS.

07:45.589 --> 07:47.823
EVERYONE ONE STICK OUT
THEIR POTATOES.

07:47.825 --> 07:49.124
MY MOTHER
AND YOUR MOTHER

07:49.126 --> 07:50.292
WERE OUT HANGING
CLOTHES.

07:50.294 --> 07:52.828
MY MOTHER PUNCHED
YOUR MOTHER IN THE NOSE.

07:52.830 --> 07:54.429
WHAT COLOR
BLOOD CAME OUT?

07:54.431 --> 07:55.063
BLUE.

07:55.065 --> 07:58.433
B-L-O-O...
SPELLS BLUE,

07:58.435 --> 08:01.136
AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU
WILL GO TO THE LAB

08:01.138 --> 08:02.304
AND HELP OUT MEPHISTO

08:02.306 --> 08:03.605
AND THEN WE CAN
ALL GO HOME

08:03.607 --> 08:05.974
AND WATCH
"MURPHY BROWN".

08:06.744 --> 08:08.744
STEVE, YOU.

08:08.746 --> 08:09.578
WHERE AM I?

08:09.580 --> 08:15.050
STEVE. STEVE.
STEVE...

08:15.052 --> 08:17.119
OH, GOOD,
YOU'RE HERE.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.154
OH, MY GOD,
THEY REVIVED GORAC.

08:19.156 --> 08:19.821
YOU BASTARDS!

08:19.823 --> 08:21.523
YES, AND I NEED YOU
TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM.

08:21.525 --> 08:24.593
SEE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

08:24.595 --> 08:26.361
UH, HI.
HI.

08:26.363 --> 08:27.829
WHAT'D HE SAY?
HE SAID HI.

08:27.831 --> 08:29.264
VERY INTERESTING.
WHERE AM I?

08:29.266 --> 08:31.166
WHAT?
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE HE IS.

08:31.168 --> 08:33.468
TELL HIM...
TELL HIM HE'S HOME.

08:33.470 --> 08:35.570
YOU'RE HOME.

08:35.572 --> 08:37.038
IN THE YEAR 1999.

08:37.040 --> 08:37.806
IT'S 1999?!

08:37.808 --> 08:39.708
HE'S BEEN FROZEN FOR
THE PAST 32 MONTHS.

08:39.710 --> 08:41.209
DUDE, YOU'VE BEEN
FROZEN FOR 32 MONTHS.

08:41.211 --> 08:43.912
AND WE FOUND YOU--
WHAT? 32 MONTHS?

08:43.914 --> 08:46.014
CALM DOWN. I THINK THAT'S
ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

08:46.016 --> 08:47.949
GOOD JOB, DUDE,
YOU FREAKED HIM OUT.

08:47.951 --> 08:49.050
SHUT UP,
ASS MASTER,

08:49.052 --> 08:50.285
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
THEY HAD ME TALK TO HIM.

08:50.287 --> 08:52.888
GUESS WHAT? YOU'RE NOT
MY BEST FRIEND ANYMORE.

08:52.890 --> 08:54.389
CARTMAN'S MY NEW
BEST FRIEND.

08:54.391 --> 08:55.390
SWEET.
OH, YEAH?

08:55.392 --> 08:56.992
WELL, YOU'RE NOT MY
BEST FRIEND ANYMORE EITHER.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.527
CARTMAN IS NOW
MY BEST FRIEND.

08:58.529 --> 09:00.162
KILLER.
FINE.

09:00.164 --> 09:06.234
FINE.
HEY.

09:06.236 --> 09:08.036
ARE YOU
ALPHONSE MEPHISTO?

09:08.038 --> 09:08.570
THE SAME.

09:08.572 --> 09:10.739
WE'RE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
CURRENTLY IN POSSESSION

09:10.741 --> 09:12.841
OF THE PREHISTORIC
ICEMAN FROM 1996.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.443
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE WOULD LIKE TO...

09:17.815 --> 09:19.414
WE WOULD LIKE TO
OFFER OUR SERVICES

09:19.416 --> 09:20.682

09:20.684 --> 09:22.450

GENTS FROM?

09:22.452 --> 09:24.619

UNIVERSITY...

09:24.621 --> 09:25.987
OF AMERICA.

09:25.989 --> 09:27.689
WELL, THERE'S NOT
A LOT TO SEE.

09:27.691 --> 09:28.924
BUT COME ON IN.

09:28.926 --> 09:30.826
HE'S STILL NOT
RESPONDING MUCH TO US.

09:30.828 --> 09:32.294
THE SHOCK IS STILL
SETTLING IN.

09:32.296 --> 09:33.495
BUT WE'VE MADE
GREAT PROGRESS

09:33.497 --> 09:35.530
NOW THAT HE'S
IN THE HABITAT.
HABITAT?

09:35.532 --> 09:37.566
YES, KEVIN AND I DESIGNED
A HABITAT FOR STEVE

09:37.568 --> 09:39.835

LIKE HIS OWN WORLD.

10:17.841 --> 10:19.841
WHICH WAS A VERY POPULAR
GROUP DURING HIS ERA.

10:19.843 --> 10:22.744
THEIR PRIMITIVE DRUMMING
SOOTHED HIS PEOPLES' TEMPERS.

10:22.746 --> 10:24.279
HE DOESN'T LOOK
VERY HAPPY IN THERE.

10:24.281 --> 10:25.046

10:30.187 --> 10:32.254
( Mephisto )
AH, HERE WE SEE THE ICEMAN
TRYING TO GAIN

10:32.256 --> 10:33.722
INTERNET ACCESS
ON THE COMPUTER.

10:33.724 --> 10:36.224
THE INTERNET WAS STILL
NOT VERY BIG IN HIS TIME,

10:36.226 --> 10:38.860
SO THE WEB FRIGHTENS
AND CONFUSES HIM.

10:38.862 --> 10:40.262
GRRR!

10:40.264 --> 10:41.696
IT'S OKAY,
HE CAN'T HURT YOU.

10:41.698 --> 10:43.698
THIS IS ONE-WAY GLASS,
HE CAN'T EVEN SEE US.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.234
AND NOW THE ICEMAN
WATCHES TELEVISION.

10:46.236 --> 10:47.936
This grizzly bear
has the strength

10:47.938 --> 10:49.738
of over ten
Morgan Freemans!

10:49.740 --> 10:51.273
I'm really pissing
him off right now.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.974
WAIT, THIS COULD
BE DANGEROUS.

10:52.976 --> 10:54.910
HOW SO?
HE'S CHANGING THE CHANNEL.

10:54.912 --> 10:56.044
SOMETHING ON
THE TELEVISION

10:56.046 --> 10:57.379
COULD FRIGHTEN
AND CONFUSE HIM.

10:57.381 --> 10:58.580
And they've
done it!

10:58.582 --> 11:02.117
The Atlanta Falcons
are going to the
Super Bowl!

11:02.119 --> 11:03.718

HE'S SCARED.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.231
HE WOULD BE MORE SCARED
ON THE OUTSIDE.

11:16.233 --> 11:17.832
YOU THINK THIS STUFF
FREAKS HIM OUT?

11:17.834 --> 11:18.867

HE'D REACT TO

THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW?

11:20.570 --> 11:21.569

14:49.179 --> 14:51.980
CALVIN IS EIGHT, AND
LITTLE BUCK IS THIRTEEN.

14:51.982 --> 14:54.182
I CAN'T JUST UP
AND LEAVE THEM.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.416
I'M SORRY.

14:55.418 --> 14:57.018
I'M SORRY, TOO.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.320
I'LL LEAVE
YOU ALONE.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.023
EIGHT AND THIRTEEN?

15:02.025 --> 15:04.259
WELL, I DON'T SEE
ANY 'CROCS OUT HERE.

15:04.261 --> 15:06.995
DAMN IT, CARTMAN! YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME GET
READY TO FIGHT KYLE,

15:06.997 --> 15:08.796
NOT PLAYING
AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK GUY.

15:08.798 --> 15:12.233
NOW I'M GONNA LET THIS JAGUAR
BITE ME IN THE FACE

15:12.235 --> 15:13.201
AND SEE IF IT HURTS.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.370
COME ON, JAGUAR,
LET'S SEE WHAT...

15:15.372 --> 15:16.304
OW!

15:16.306 --> 15:17.205
SON-OF-A-BITCH!

15:17.207 --> 15:18.873
YOU SUCK AS A BEST FRIEND,
CARTMAN.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.875
YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH CAT.

15:25.048 --> 15:26.114
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, GORAC?

15:26.116 --> 15:27.615
I CAN'T LIVE
IN YOUR TIME.

15:27.617 --> 15:29.450
I'M FREEZING
MYSELF AGAIN.

15:29.452 --> 15:31.052
WOW, THAT SUCKS, DUDE.

15:31.054 --> 15:31.920
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

15:31.922 --> 15:33.555
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR
THREE AND A HALF HOURS NOW

15:33.557 --> 15:35.623
AND ONLY MY TOES ARE
STARTING TO ICE OVER.

15:35.625 --> 15:36.691
STEVE, WAIT.

15:36.693 --> 15:37.859
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, DICK?

15:37.861 --> 15:39.127
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO FIGHT
UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK.

15:39.129 --> 15:40.428
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO SHOW STEVE, DICK.

15:40.430 --> 15:42.830
GORAC IS BUSY FREEZING
HIMSELF AGAIN, DICK.

15:42.832 --> 15:45.867
STEVE, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FREEZE YOURSELF. LOOK!

15:45.869 --> 15:46.534
WHAT IS THAT?

15:46.536 --> 15:48.203
IT'S THIS PLACE
CALLED DES MOINES.

15:48.205 --> 15:49.604
IT'S, LIKE,
LOST IN TIME.

15:49.606 --> 15:51.105
SEE? EVERYBODY
LOOKS LIKE YOU DO.

15:51.107 --> 15:52.473
FASHION IS
THREE YEARS BEHIND.

15:52.475 --> 15:53.741
TECHNOLOGY IS
THREE YEARS BEHIND.

15:53.743 --> 15:56.678
FADS ARE THREE YEARS
BEHIND, JUST LIKE YOU.

15:59.182 --> 16:00.315
HOME.

16:00.317 --> 16:02.250
COME ON, STEVE, YOU'RE GOING
TO DES MOINES.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.685
OH, NO, YOU DON'T,
GLORY-MONGER.

16:03.687 --> 16:05.220
GORAC IS MY
RESPONSIBILITY.

16:05.222 --> 16:06.354
I'LL TAKE HIM
TO DES MOINES.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.989
NO, YOU WON'T,
BUTTHOLE.

16:07.991 --> 16:10.325
( sirens )

16:10.327 --> 16:11.659
THEY'RE COMING FOR ME.

16:11.661 --> 16:12.427
COME ON.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.495
THESE JAGUARS
CAN BE REAL MEAN.

16:14.497 --> 16:16.097
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
SMACK IT IN THE FACE.

16:16.099 --> 16:19.000
WAS THE ICEMAN HERE?
HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN,
BY CRICKEY!

16:19.002 --> 16:20.335
WE HAVE TO
GET HIM BACK.

16:20.337 --> 16:21.803
WELL, CAN YOU DO IT?

16:21.805 --> 16:22.971
SURE I CAN.

16:22.973 --> 16:25.540
I CAN HUNT
DOWN ANYTHING.

16:25.542 --> 16:29.978
WOW! KICK ASS!

16:29.980 --> 16:32.113
WE NEED A ONE-WAY TICKET
TO DES MOINES, PLEASE.

16:32.115 --> 16:33.781
DES MOINES?
WHAT THE HELL FOR?

16:33.783 --> 16:35.416
WE HAVE TO GET
OUR FRIEND STEVE--

16:35.418 --> 16:36.351
MY FRIEND GORAC!

16:36.353 --> 16:37.819
TO DES MOINES OR ELSE
HE'S GONNA MELT AWAY.

16:37.821 --> 16:39.354
NO, HE'S NOT
GONNA MELT AWAY.

16:39.356 --> 16:41.122
THAT'S FROSTY,
YOU STUPID BUTTHOLE.

16:41.124 --> 16:42.390
FROSTY, STEVE,
WHATEVER.

16:42.392 --> 16:45.526
WELL, OKAY,
I'LL FIND HIM A SEAT.

16:45.528 --> 16:46.794
DUDE, LOOK,
IT'S FOUR O'CLOCK.

16:46.796 --> 16:48.196
OH, WE'LL WAIT FOR YOU
OVER THERE, STEVE.

16:48.198 --> 16:49.497
WE HAVE TO START
FIGHTING NOW.

16:49.499 --> 16:51.065
OKAY, BOYS, THANKS.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.801
OKAY, FIRST ONE
TO DIE LOSES.

16:53.803 --> 16:55.136
OKAY.

16:55.138 --> 16:56.237
OKAY.

16:56.239 --> 16:57.071
OKAY.

16:57.073 --> 16:58.673
SO, HERE WE GO.

16:58.675 --> 17:00.642
OKAY.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.876
GO.

17:10.253 --> 17:12.020
WAIT A SECOND.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.858
I THINK HE CAME
THROUGH HERE RECENTLY.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.559
YEAH, I THINK
THE SAME THING.

17:18.561 --> 17:19.694
WELL, WHERE
THE HELL IS HE?

17:19.696 --> 17:21.029
WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM
BACK TO THE LAB.

17:21.031 --> 17:22.997
HE CAN'T FUNCTION OUT
HERE IN OUR TIME.

17:22.999 --> 17:23.931
CALM DOWN,
CALM DOWN.

17:23.933 --> 17:26.467
YEAH, CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN,
YOU SONS-OF-BITCHES.

17:26.469 --> 17:28.536
WAIT, LOOK.
IS IT HIM?

17:28.538 --> 17:31.072
NO, IT'S A ROCKY MOUNTAIN
RATTLESNAKE.

17:31.074 --> 17:34.309
THIS IS THE MOST POISONOUS
SNAKE IN THIS ENTIRE REGION.

17:34.311 --> 17:37.812
SO, WHAT I'M GONNA DO
IS CAREFULLY SNEAK UP ON HIM

17:37.814 --> 17:40.014
AND JAM MY THUMB
IN IT'S BUTTHOLE.

17:40.016 --> 17:43.251
CRIKEY! THIS SNAKE
IS REALLY PISSED.

17:43.253 --> 17:45.920
I'M GONNA JAM MY THUMB
IN HIS BUTTHOLE NOW.

17:45.922 --> 17:48.523
OH, YEAH, THAT PISSED
IT OFF, ALRIGHT.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.891
DOES HE ALWAYS
DO THIS?
YEAH.

17:49.893 --> 17:54.162
I'M GONNA GO JAM MY THUMB
IN SOMETHING'S BUTTHOLE NOW.

17:57.334 --> 17:58.466
OW!
OW!

17:58.468 --> 17:59.967
WATCH MY COAT,
DUDE.
OH.

17:59.969 --> 18:01.836
I GOT MY TICKET.
HUH?

18:01.838 --> 18:03.504
I HAVE TO GO
TO PLATFORM B.

18:03.506 --> 18:07.008
OH, OKAY, IT'S
OVER THIS WAY.

18:11.815 --> 18:13.448
THE TRAIL ENDS HERE.

18:13.450 --> 18:14.582
THE TRAIN STATION?

18:14.584 --> 18:15.917
THEN HE'S TRYING
TO GO SOMEWHERE.

18:15.919 --> 18:17.785
HAVE YOU SEEN A MAN
WHO LOOKS SIMILAR TO US

18:17.787 --> 18:19.587
BUT WITH A THICKER BROW
AND APE-ISH NOSE?

18:19.589 --> 18:21.255
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:21.257 --> 18:23.057
AN ICEMAN,
A MAN FROM THE PAST.

18:23.059 --> 18:25.259
WE MUST FIND HIM.
NOW, WHERE IS HE?

18:26.429 --> 18:27.562
( grunts )

18:27.564 --> 18:28.730
WELL, THIS IS IT.

18:28.732 --> 18:29.964
I'M GOING BACK
TO MY TIME.

18:29.966 --> 18:31.632
THANKS AGAIN, BOYS.

18:31.634 --> 18:33.167
NO PROBLEM,
GORAC.

18:33.169 --> 18:33.735
LATER.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.136
YOU BOYS HAVE
REALLY SHOWN ME

18:35.138 --> 18:36.304
THE TRUE MEANING
OF FRIENDSHIP.

18:36.306 --> 18:38.506
YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT
ANYTHING BUT MY HAPPINESS.

18:38.508 --> 18:39.874
YOU PUT ME IN
FRONT OF YOURSELVES,

18:39.876 --> 18:42.377
AND THAT'S WHAT REAL
FRIENDSHIP IS ALL ABOUT.

18:42.379 --> 18:44.178
YEP.
UH-HUH.

18:44.180 --> 18:45.313
AFTER BEING FROZEN,

18:45.315 --> 18:47.115
I'VE LEARNED THAT
ALL A PERSON HAS IN LIFE

18:47.117 --> 18:48.149
IS FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

18:48.151 --> 18:50.284
IF YOU LOSE THOSE,
YOU HAVE NOTHING.

18:50.286 --> 18:51.686
SO FRIENDS ARE
TO BE TREASURED

18:51.688 --> 18:53.821
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

18:53.823 --> 18:55.289
RIGHT ON.
COOL.

18:55.291 --> 18:59.060
GOODBYE BOYS,
GOODBYE, FRIENDS.

19:01.364 --> 19:03.131
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE'S STEVE?

19:03.133 --> 19:05.133
HIS NAME
IS GORAC.

19:05.135 --> 19:07.335
HIS NAME
IS STEVE.

19:07.337 --> 19:08.603
THE TRAIN.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.037
WE'VE GOT TO STOP IT.

19:10.039 --> 19:11.739
NO WORRIES.

19:11.741 --> 19:12.774
LET'S GET HIM.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.108
NO!
NO!

19:15.044 --> 19:16.644
WE'VE GOT TO
STOP THAT TRAIN.

19:16.646 --> 19:19.347
COME BACK HERE, YOU.

19:19.349 --> 19:21.182
STEVE, STEVE,
LOOK OUT!

19:21.184 --> 19:22.583
THEY'RE AFTER YOU.

19:23.820 --> 19:26.287
OH, HE'S A WILY ONE.

19:26.289 --> 19:28.756
OH, POOP!
STEVE, LOOK OUT.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.627
NOTICE THE DILATED PUPILS
OF THIS PREHISTORIC MAN.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.862
A SURE SIGN THE
PREY IS FRIGHTENED.

19:34.864 --> 19:35.696
AS WELL AS HE SHOULD BE

19:35.698 --> 19:37.932
AS I WILL NOW JAM
MY THUMB IN HIS BUTTHOLE.

19:37.934 --> 19:38.966
HUH?
CRIKEY!

19:38.968 --> 19:40.468
STOP THE TRAIN.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.702
HEY, WHO ARE YOU?

19:41.704 --> 19:43.738
I SAID
STOP THAT TRAIN.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.206
YES, HELLO,
I SEE YOU.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.841
THEY'RE ALL MOVING
PRETTY FAST,

19:46.843 --> 19:49.444
BUT I'LL CATCH UP
TO THEM, BY CRIKEY!

19:50.914 --> 19:52.547
I'VE GOT YOU
PINNED, I WIN.

19:52.549 --> 19:55.149
NOW I'VE GOT YOU
PINNED, I WIN.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.286
( gunshots )
OH!

19:59.255 --> 20:01.122
HEY, IT'S OKAY,
THE CHOPPER IS HERE.

20:01.124 --> 20:03.291
GO GET HIM, BOYS,
CUT HIM OFF.

20:03.293 --> 20:05.660
NO!
NOW FOR THE
<i>COUP DE GRACE.</i>

20:05.662 --> 20:08.496
I'LL GET MY
THUMB UP HERE.

20:08.498 --> 20:13.367
OHHHH!

20:16.239 --> 20:18.473
UH, HE TRAIN'S
NOT STOPPING.

20:18.475 --> 20:21.242
IT'S NOT STOPPING!

20:21.244 --> 20:23.544
AHHHH!

20:23.546 --> 20:25.546
GOLLY!

20:25.548 --> 20:27.315
WHERE'S GORAC?

20:27.584 --> 20:33.988
WOW, THAT IS THE GOD-DAMNEST
THING I EVER SEEN.

20:33.990 --> 20:34.689
WHERE'S THE ICEMAN?

20:34.691 --> 20:37.024
HE HAS TO BE AROUND
HERE SOMEWHERE.

20:39.262 --> 20:40.995
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S GONE.

20:40.997 --> 20:43.197
WAIT. LOOK.
THE HELICOPTER.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.599
STEVE.
HE'S ALIVE.

20:44.601 --> 20:47.435
GOODBYE AGAIN.
I'M OFF TO DES MOINES.

20:47.437 --> 20:48.202
NO, COME BACK.

20:48.204 --> 20:50.905
YOU CAN'T ADAPT,
YOU'LL NEVER LIVE.

20:50.907 --> 20:52.306
I'M NOT LIVING HERE.

20:52.308 --> 20:53.875
LIVING IS HAVING
UPS AND DOWNS

20:53.877 --> 20:56.010
AND SHARING THEM
WITH FRIENDS.

20:56.012 --> 20:57.778
THANK YOU,
STAN AND KYLE.

20:57.780 --> 20:58.779
SEE YA!

20:58.781 --> 21:01.349
DAMN! WELL, SO MUCH FOR OUR
PLAN TO USE THE ICEMAN

21:01.351 --> 21:02.717
TO TAKE OVER SWEDEN.

21:02.719 --> 21:03.484
WHAT?
WHAT? NOTHING.

21:03.486 --> 21:05.953
KYLE, STEVE IS A PRETTY
GOOD NAME FOR THAT GUY.

21:05.955 --> 21:08.589
NO, DUDE, GORAC IS COOL
BECAUSE IT'S ORIGINAL.

21:08.591 --> 21:09.824
AND BESIDES,
YOU FOUND HIM.

21:09.826 --> 21:13.194
BE VERY,
VERY QUIET.

21:13.196 --> 21:15.963
I'M HUNTING CROCODILES.
HA HA HA HA!

21:15.965 --> 21:17.098
CAN WE BE BEST
FRIENDS AGAIN?

21:17.100 --> 21:19.033
I HATE HAVING CARTMAN
AS A BEST FRIEND.

21:19.035 --> 21:20.134
ME, TOO.
HE SUCKS.

21:20.136 --> 21:23.037
OH, YEAH? WELL, I DON'T
NEED YOU GUYS ANYWAY.

21:23.039 --> 21:24.272
YOU GUYS CAN
KISS MY...

21:24.274 --> 21:26.874
A-HA! THERE'S
A KING 'CROC RIGHT THERE.

21:26.876 --> 21:31.045
AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO
IS I'M GONNA SNEAK UP ON IT

21:31.047 --> 21:32.547
AND JAM MY THUMB IN--

21:32.549 --> 21:36.250
( mooing)
HEY, GET ME
OUT OF HERE!

21:36.252 --> 21:36.984
IT SMELLS LIKE...

21:36.986 --> 21:41.155
HEY, IT SMELLS LIKE
KENNY'S HOUSE IN HERE.

21:43.192 --> 21:46.627
( man singing )
