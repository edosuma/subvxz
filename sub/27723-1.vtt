[indistinct chatter, laughter]

00:37.037 --> 00:39.373
[Kevin] There you go!

00:39.999 --> 00:41.500
Be right back.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.923
[bartender] Thank you, sir.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.556
-[gasps] Oh! Oh!
-Damn, I'm sorry.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.392
Uh, it's okay.
Honestly, it's, it's fine.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.019
I can do it.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.437
Your accent,
you sound like you're from...

01:02.479 --> 01:04.940
-[chuckles] Scotland.
-Scotland.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.484
That's what I was gonna say.
[chuckles]

01:07.526 --> 01:10.863
-Foreign-exchange student?
-Yeah.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.866
I'm Kevin.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.953
-Ana.
-Nice to meet you, Ana.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.329
Nice to meet you, too.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.455
Do you wanna come have a drink

01:20.497 --> 01:22.499
with me and my friends?

01:23.667 --> 01:27.004
-Uh...
-[Kevin] Come on.

01:27.046 --> 01:30.340
No, thanks,
I'm studying. Yeah.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.092
-Studying in a bar.
-Mm-hmm.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.553
I like your style, Ana.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.514
-I like yours, too, Kevin.
-Thanks.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.439
Oh, yeah!

01:45.480 --> 01:47.024
That's right.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.490
Almost hit it.

02:02.039 --> 02:05.500
[intense music]

02:30.985 --> 02:34.404
[music continues]

02:38.492 --> 02:40.452
[gasps] Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.079
Oh, you shattered my eardrum.

02:42.121 --> 02:45.624
I'm sorry, really.
There's some guy following me.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.334
Oh, yeah?

02:48.167 --> 02:49.920
Hey!

02:50.295 --> 02:51.755
Creeper!

02:52.881 --> 02:54.883
Well, look at this winner.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.887
Come closer
so we could see your face!

03:00.931 --> 03:03.725
Don't worry.
We outnumber him.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.397
Yeah, that's right!
Run home to Mommy!

03:14.361 --> 03:17.156
-My name is Monica.
-Ana.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.783
Come on.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.661
-I'll walk you home, Ana.
-Okay.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.582
[Monica shudders]

03:29.334 --> 03:31.170
Oh, God!

03:31.962 --> 03:33.839
God, I'm freezing.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.717
What about you?
It's balls-ass cold.

03:36.758 --> 03:41.013
-"Balls-ass?"
-Like, really freaking cold.

03:41.055 --> 03:44.975
[laughs] Actually, no.
It gets far colder
than this where I'm from.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.811
I wouldn't be able
to handle it.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.691
You miss your family?

03:52.733 --> 03:56.695
It's complicated, huh?
My family is complicated, too.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.198
-Where are you from?
-Fallbrook.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.825
Middle of nowhere.
You'd love it.

04:01.867 --> 04:02.826
[chuckles]

04:02.868 --> 04:06.413
[tuba music playing]

04:11.793 --> 04:14.337
What the hell is that?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.424
That is the reason

04:17.465 --> 04:19.676
why I study in bars.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.261
My roommate.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.679
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.223
She plays the tuba
in the marching band.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.850
[laughing]
Oh! You poor thing!

04:26.892 --> 04:28.060
Yeah.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.520
Thanks for walking me home.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.273
Should we get
each other's numbers?

04:33.941 --> 04:34.983
[awkward chuckle]

04:35.025 --> 04:37.485
Uh, to clear the air,

04:37.527 --> 04:41.364
I wasn't checking you out
at the bar.

04:41.406 --> 04:46.536
You just...
reminded me of someone.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.330
I didn't think
you were checking me out.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.292
You suck at lying.
[chuckles]

04:52.333 --> 04:55.336
I like that.
Very un-American.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.172
[chuckles]

04:57.214 --> 04:58.632
Here.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.597
Be careful.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.224
You be careful.

05:07.266 --> 05:12.479
-That sounds dangerous.
-[both laugh]

[dramatic music]

05:45.762 --> 05:49.266
[keys jingling]

06:02.487 --> 06:05.490
[Monica] This is twisted.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.575
Has anything else weird
happened?

06:07.617 --> 06:09.161
Not really.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.163
"Not really?"

06:11.205 --> 06:14.249
Sometimes I just feel like
someone's watching me.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.626
I don't know.
I could just be paranoid.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.213
What do you think
I should do?

06:19.838 --> 06:21.548
You should stay with me.

06:21.589 --> 06:24.467
-[scoffs]
-Seriously. This guy
knows where you live.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.011
-You hate your roommate.
-I don't hate Karen.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.429
And I've got a huge place
all to myself.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.515
My place is covered
by the exchange program.

06:30.557 --> 06:34.936
-I can't afford to--
-I'm not asking you
for money, Ana.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.691
But... I can't just
move in somewhere

06:39.733 --> 06:41.276
and not pay anything.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.945
Yes, you can.
My parents pay the rent.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.490
-Oh, and they wouldn't mind?
-They would love you.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.492
You're sweet, wholesome--

06:49.534 --> 06:51.494
Yeah, I wouldn't call myself
wholesome.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.413
You don't drink,
you go to church,

06:54.455 --> 06:56.750
you volunteer
at a children's hospital,

06:56.791 --> 07:01.213
and, best of all, you're
saving yourself for marriage.

07:01.255 --> 07:04.966
-That's what I would tell them.
-Are you being serious?

07:05.008 --> 07:06.676
You'd actually
have to tell them all that?

07:06.718 --> 07:08.220
Say yes, say yes, say yes!

07:08.262 --> 07:10.889
-Okay, yes! Yes!
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

07:10.931 --> 07:13.308
[both giggle]

07:13.892 --> 07:16.061
Yes. Okay.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.525
[Monica chuckles]

07:22.567 --> 07:24.778
-[Monica] Welcome home.
-Thank you.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.113
-Here, let me take this.
-Okay.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.366
-Just make yourself at home.
-Okay.

07:29.408 --> 07:33.745
[pop music playing]

07:33.787 --> 07:36.957
Um, do you want to grab
the frying pan?

07:36.998 --> 07:39.667
-Yes. In here?
-In there. Yeah.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.048
Awesome.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.926
Yeah. Thank you.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.387
[laughing, indistinct chatter]

07:50.429 --> 07:53.014
You just look so bored there,
you know, so...

07:53.056 --> 07:55.016
What?

07:55.058 --> 07:56.643
[indistinct chatter]

08:02.190 --> 08:03.650
Okay.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.486
[Monica] I love that you know
how to play chess.

08:06.527 --> 08:09.114
It was my sister's
favorite game.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.043
[sighs]

08:22.085 --> 08:24.379
Did you have a roommate
before me?

08:24.421 --> 08:26.423
No.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.508
Then why the twin beds?

08:31.261 --> 08:34.722
My sister and I had these
since we were kids.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.059
I can never get rid of them.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.770
Is she...

08:41.729 --> 08:43.690
Dead.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.692
Car accident.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.528
I'm sorry.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.869
Her name was Camilla.

08:57.412 --> 09:00.623
You're the first person
I've ever let sleep in her bed.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.167
Really?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.837
Thank you.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.388
You look like her,
you know?

09:15.263 --> 09:17.932
A lot like her.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.395
-I'll take that as a compliment.
-It is.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.691
You have
any brothers or sisters?

09:27.859 --> 09:30.445
Just my mum and I.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.407
We lived in the country
with my grandparents

09:33.448 --> 09:35.492
when I was little.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.952
You know, it was nice.

09:38.912 --> 09:43.666
Then... my mum got mad
at my grandma

09:43.708 --> 09:46.169
and moved us to the city.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.964
Then things got pretty bad.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.799
Bad how?

09:55.803 --> 09:58.432
You don't have
to talk about it.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.646
My mum's an addict.

10:05.688 --> 10:10.693
Drugs, alcohol, sex.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.782
-She's abused it all.
-Wow.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.910
How did you end up so normal?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.161
[Ana laughs]

10:20.203 --> 10:21.871
I'm not that boring.

10:21.913 --> 10:25.417
Who said anything
about boring?

10:25.459 --> 10:28.086
My friends back home,
for one.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.174
It's hard to get excited
about partying

10:33.216 --> 10:38.221
when you find your mum covered
in vomit one too many times.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.811
Does this mean we can't party?

10:46.062 --> 10:49.857
I've loosened up...
a bit.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.115
Goodnight.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.908
Night.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.462
[cell phone beeps]

11:11.129 --> 11:14.673
[suspenseful music]

11:46.873 --> 11:50.001
-[Kevin] Ana?
-[gasps] Oh. Kevin.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.879
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.048
You going to class?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.091
-No, I was just leaving.
-Same.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.677
Do you mind
if I walk with you?

11:58.717 --> 12:00.470
Sure.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.810
Have you had a chance
to check out the city

12:07.852 --> 12:09.770
or any of the museums or...

12:09.812 --> 12:11.981
Not yet. I'd like to. I've just
been too wrapped up in school.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.651
Ah, me, too. I can barely
find my way around.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.445
-You're not from here?
-No, I'm a small-town boy.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.948
Cities are
a bit overwhelming to me.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.035
Maybe we could do some
exploring together sometime.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.162
[chuckles] Maybe.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.417
Could I get your number?

12:30.458 --> 12:33.461
We'll see each other around,
I'm sure.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.756
Well, I am this way.

12:37.798 --> 12:41.511
[chuckles] You don't want me
to know where you live.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.221
You know, I almost asked Monica
for your number,

12:43.263 --> 12:45.056
but I didn't want
to scare you off.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.100
Oh, that's right.
You know Monica.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.851
Little bit. Yeah,
we're from the same hometown.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.354
She's been really nice to me.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.607
Good. You deserve it.

12:53.648 --> 12:57.985
Well, Ana, until we see
each other around... adieu.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.958
[intense music]

13:33.438 --> 13:35.523
[Monica] Is this blood?

13:35.565 --> 13:39.068
-[sighs] I think so.
-Oh, this is too much.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.904
We should go to the police.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.659
-Can they do anything?
-Unfortunately, probably not.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.119
But we have to do something.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.166
[sighs]

13:53.207 --> 13:56.544
I just moved in here
and he knows it.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.213
He must be following me
all the time.

14:04.719 --> 14:08.473
You don't think it could be
your friend Kevin, do you?

14:08.889 --> 14:11.142
Kevin?

14:11.184 --> 14:14.228
I ran into him today right after
I got more creepy texts.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.773
No way.
Kevin is way too boring.

14:16.815 --> 14:20.193
Really? He doesn't seem
that boring to me.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.237
Okay, now I'm confused.

14:23.279 --> 14:28.493
Are you scared of him
or do you like him?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.870
[exhales] I don't know.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.706
I just feel like
I can't trust anybody.

14:32.747 --> 14:36.543
[scoffs]
This is so messed up.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.176
Let's get out of here.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.302
And go where?

14:46.344 --> 14:49.889
My hometown. Fallbrook.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.432
What about school?

14:51.474 --> 14:54.644
Spring break's coming up,
so we head out early.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.397
We can study
at my parents' house.

14:57.438 --> 15:00.692
I mean, there's nothing else
to do there.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.610
And by the time we get back,

15:02.652 --> 15:05.405
hopefully,
this stalker has gone back

15:05.446 --> 15:07.782
to watching porn
and playing video games.

15:07.824 --> 15:10.243
And if not...

15:12.412 --> 15:14.497
then we call the police.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.209
And your parents
wouldn't mind?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.253
Are you kidding me?

15:20.294 --> 15:22.630
They're not gonna want you
to leave.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.048
[chuckles]

15:24.758 --> 15:26.467
Okay.

15:32.807 --> 15:36.269
[footsteps approaching]

15:37.019 --> 15:38.688
-Whoa!
-[chuckles]

15:38.730 --> 15:40.356
Oh.

15:40.398 --> 15:42.316
My parents are, uh,

15:42.358 --> 15:43.984
pretty conservative.

15:44.026 --> 15:47.196
I know I should just be myself
around them, but...

15:47.238 --> 15:49.407
I think you look great.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
Not too Amish?

15:50.658 --> 15:53.787
Mm...
Kind of naughty Amish.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.872
[both laughing]

15:57.415 --> 15:59.041
-I like it.
-Oh.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.628
[laughs] I do.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.417
Welcome to Fallbrook.

16:41.459 --> 16:45.421
There's a small downtown,
but it's half an hour away.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.256
The families here
take care of each other.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.467
You know,
one family gives us fresh eggs.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.928
We give them vegetables
in return.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.596
That seems really nice.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.431
Kind of a hippie vibe,
I guess,

16:55.473 --> 16:57.224
without all the drugs and sex

16:57.266 --> 17:00.060
-and other fun stuff.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.813
We have arrived!

17:01.855 --> 17:04.190
-Yeah!
-Home.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.900
[Monica] Home!

17:19.455 --> 17:20.957
-Cool.
-[Peter] Monica-Bear!

17:20.999 --> 17:23.459
-Daddy!
-Ha-ha!

17:23.501 --> 17:24.919
Oh!

17:24.961 --> 17:27.296
-You're still my good girl?
-Always.

17:27.338 --> 17:31.050
This is my friend, Ana.
She's from Scotland.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.802
I'm sure you'll love her
just as much as I do.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.095
Welcome to our little slice
of heaven, Ana.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.181
-I'm Peter.
-So nice to meet you, Peter.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.142
-Oh...
-Oh!

17:40.184 --> 17:41.936
-Scotland, is it?
-[Ana] Mm-hmm.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.479
It's a beautiful country.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.065
Traditional, family-oriented.

17:46.106 --> 17:49.736
We could stand to learn a thing
or two from your culture.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.573
Oh, my goodness. You,
you really do look like her.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.824
Our daughter, Camilla.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.368
-Monica told me.
-I-I...

17:57.410 --> 17:59.078
-Hello, Ana. I-I'm sorry.
-Hello.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.080
I'm having a little bit
of a silly moment. That's...

18:01.121 --> 18:02.749
-I'm Olivia.
-Nice to meet you.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.918
-Oh! Oh, my goodness.
-[chuckles]

18:04.959 --> 18:06.627
-We're huggers.
-Okay.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.755
-Hi, Mommy.
-Hi, sweet girl!

18:08.796 --> 18:10.089
Oh, my goodness.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.841
-[Olivia] How are you?
-[Monica] Good.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.134
Come inside.
I've got pies and cookies.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.803
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, our bags!

18:15.845 --> 18:17.722
No, no, no,
that's what the big lug is for.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.181
[laughing]

18:19.223 --> 18:20.767
-[Olivia] How was the trip?
-[Ana] Great!

18:20.808 --> 18:23.143
-Yeah, it wasn't bad at all.
-Yeah.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.562
What kind of cookies
did you make?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.272
Well, I wasn't sure
what kind Ana likes,

18:26.313 --> 18:27.899
so I made chocolate-chip,
peanut-butter and oatmeal.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.609
-I hope that's all right.
-Oh!

18:29.650 --> 18:31.151
I hope you don't expect us
to eat them all.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.946
Well, of course I do.
Look at the two of you.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.615
You're wasting away.
Are they feeding you up there?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.324

[mellow music]

19:07.396 --> 19:09.148
Ooh!

19:09.189 --> 19:12.819
So to what do we owe
this, uh, this unexpected visit?

19:12.860 --> 19:14.779
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm not complaining.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.823
But I just about
danced for joy

19:16.864 --> 19:18.198
when you told me
you were coming.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.867
She did.
I think it was the Polka.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.286
-Oh, stop.
-We just needed a little break

19:22.328 --> 19:23.830
from the city.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.540
I recommend a permanent break
from the city.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.334
-It's not that bad.
-Mm.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.544
Cities bring out the worst
in people.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.881
It's every man for himself.
No sense of community.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.216
Without community,
what are we? Animals.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.636
I like animals.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.056
Sorry, Daddy.
I was just joking.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.557
Peter and I were hesitant

19:43.599 --> 19:46.560
to allow Monica
to go to school in the city.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.270
Um, I tried to convince her

19:48.312 --> 19:51.691
to, to stay put and take courses
on the computer, the...

19:51.732 --> 19:54.027
Kind of hard
to take online classes

19:54.068 --> 19:56.779
when your house
doesn't have Internet.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.364
They're both
computer illiterate.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.366
And proud of it.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.035
Monica is our youngest.

20:02.076 --> 20:06.664
And as you can see, Ana,
we tend to indulge her.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.126
What about you? Are you
from the country or the city?

20:10.168 --> 20:11.711
I was raised in the country.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.295
Ah, I knew it.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.966
But then my mother took us
to the city.

20:17.008 --> 20:20.053
Hm. Which do you prefer?

20:20.094 --> 20:22.513
Um, I think the country.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.975
It reminds me of my childhood.
I've missed that.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.352

Everything in here is the same
as it was the day that...

I don't mind, um,

sleeping in Monica's room.

-Would that be better?
-No, no.

21:40.174 --> 21:44.137
That's fine. This room
was meant to be lived in.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.391
I'm so glad you're here.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.269
So am I.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.106
Peter thinks you're something
special, you know?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.983

have forgotten

21:57.024 --> 21:58.734
how to raise children properly.

Now he can point to you
as Exhibit A.

they still work.

32:22.232 --> 32:25.151
You remind us so much of her.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.613
It's almost like...

32:27.654 --> 32:29.740
she's back with us.

32:42.836 --> 32:46.715
[sighs] "You can run,
but you can't hide."

32:49.468 --> 32:52.220
Okay, he knows you left,

32:52.262 --> 32:55.808
but he doesn't know
where you are.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.101
[chuckles] I mean,
even if he did,

32:58.143 --> 32:59.436
do you know what
my dad would do

32:59.478 --> 33:00.979
if anybody
tried to mess with you?

33:01.020 --> 33:02.314
[chuckles] I don't wanna know.

33:02.355 --> 33:05.358
Trust me,
it would not be pretty.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.195
-You're safe here.
-[Ana] I know.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.409
You wanna go
check out the town today?

33:14.451 --> 33:16.703
We could pick up groceries
for my mom.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.163
Sure. Sounds good.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.750
[rock music]

33:28.966 --> 33:31.510
Here we are.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.949
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

33:53.991 --> 33:57.536
You know, you really
remind me of someone.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.747
-Camilla?
-Camilla?

34:02.081 --> 34:05.544
That's right.
Camilla Jansen.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.045
[sighs] Poor girl.

34:07.086 --> 34:10.632
She died in that
horrible car accident.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.510
Are you part of the family?

34:13.552 --> 34:15.554
I'm just a friend.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.891
Something wrong?

34:20.809 --> 34:23.020
They were too strict
on that girl.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.271
How so?

34:25.313 --> 34:27.607
People say
she was trying to run away

34:27.649 --> 34:29.860
when the accident happened.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.071
Oh.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.447
It's a rumor.

34:34.489 --> 34:38.577
Every small town
has its share of those.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.663
Enjoy.

34:43.832 --> 34:45.751
[door opens]

34:46.960 --> 34:48.587
Must've driven all through
the night to get here.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.798
-It was a great drive, though.
-Oh. Well...

34:53.466 --> 34:54.760
Wow! Uh...

34:54.801 --> 34:58.555
You, you really do
look like her.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.892
I'm sorry, you must be sick
of hearing that, but, uh...

35:01.934 --> 35:05.604
Uh, Camilla was like
a daughter to me, so, um...

35:05.645 --> 35:09.148
Ana, this is Sheriff Eden.
My dad's best friend.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.526
-They're practically brothers.
-Well...

35:11.568 --> 35:14.153
Well, Peter and I go all
the way back to Sunday school.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.698
I was best man at his wedding
and then he returned the favor

35:16.740 --> 35:19.200
when Maribell finally gave up
and decided to marry me.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.369
[chuckles]

35:21.411 --> 35:23.080
You're from the UK,
is that right?

35:23.121 --> 35:25.290
-Scotland.
-Oh.

35:25.331 --> 35:27.333
Well, welcome to Fallbrook.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.461
Thank you.
It's very nice here.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.797
-It is. Isn't it?
-[Ana] Mm-hmm.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.424
Well, it's Tuesday,
which means

35:34.466 --> 35:36.259
the girls and I
will be around for dinner,

35:36.301 --> 35:38.929
so I will see
you two girls later.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.806
You, um... [chuckles]

35:40.847 --> 35:43.100
-[Ana and Monica chuckling]
-You have a lovely afternoon.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.977
Bye, Sheriff Eden.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.646
You see that?

35:47.687 --> 35:49.856
We even got the cops
on our side.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.901
No one can mess with you
in Fallbrook.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.444
[Ana giggles]

36:01.242 --> 36:02.702
Oh.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.871
Oops.

36:04.913 --> 36:07.415
-Let's go shopping today?
-Yeah.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.043
[laughing]

36:10.085 --> 36:11.878
[Kevin] Hey, Monica. Here.
Let me give you a hand.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.005
[Ana gasps]

36:13.046 --> 36:15.966
-Ana?
-Kevin?

36:16.008 --> 36:18.135
Wow!
This is a pleasant surprise.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.928
Uh, just a little help
over here?

36:19.970 --> 36:21.805
Sorry.

36:21.847 --> 36:25.851
[Kevin] Ah. Huh. Oh.
[chuckles] Oh.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.898
-There you go.
-[Monica] Thanks.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.399
It's good to see you.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.986
-What are you doing here?
-Visiting my mom.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.737
What about you guys?

36:37.779 --> 36:40.281
We just needed
a little getaway.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.576
Well, cool.
We should hang out.

36:47.164 --> 36:50.000
-Or not. [laughs]
-[Monica laughs]

36:50.042 --> 36:52.669
We'll see.
Uh, we're kind of busy.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.129
All right.

36:54.171 --> 36:56.048
I gotta get some stuff
for my mom.

36:56.089 --> 36:59.551
-It's good to see you, Ana.
-You, too.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.849
That was awkward.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.229
You don't think it's weird
he just shows up here?

37:11.270 --> 37:13.065
This is his hometown, Ana.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.608
But spring break
hasn't started yet.

37:15.650 --> 37:18.319
We left early, remember?

37:18.361 --> 37:20.488
I guess he did, too.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.490
But why?

37:23.491 --> 37:25.410
Well... I don't really know

37:25.451 --> 37:27.370
if he wants everybody
to know this,

37:27.412 --> 37:30.040
but... his mom's
been pretty sick

37:30.082 --> 37:32.125
the last couple of years.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.545
I don't think
she has much time left, so...

37:35.587 --> 37:38.256
Oh, my God, are you serious?

37:38.297 --> 37:39.883
Unfortunately.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.843
I am such a jerk.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.178
I was so rude to him.

37:43.220 --> 37:46.347
-No, you weren't.
-Yeah, I was.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.641
Should I go talk to him?
I should go talk to him.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.937
Relax. I can give you
his number if you want.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.315
Hey.

37:57.234 --> 38:01.113
This is why stalking
is so evil.

38:01.154 --> 38:04.490
That jerk
has gotten into your head.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.326
You don't know
who to trust anymore.

38:08.327 --> 38:11.039
But you have to remember...

38:11.081 --> 38:13.291
you are the victim.

38:13.332 --> 38:16.211
None of this is your fault.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.635
[sighs]

38:40.318 --> 38:42.361
Can I ask you something?

38:43.113 --> 38:44.489
Okay.

38:44.530 --> 38:48.034
The woman at the cafe
mentioned Camilla.

38:48.076 --> 38:50.745
Well,
you do look like her.

38:50.787 --> 38:55.333
She, uh, she said
that Camilla was running away

38:55.374 --> 38:57.669
when she...

38:57.710 --> 39:01.965
This town
is a hotbed of gossip, Ana.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.676
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.636
-Especially about us.
-I'm sorry.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.472
I shouldn't have
mentioned anything.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.933
Hey, you mind if I take off
for a little bit?

39:11.975 --> 39:13.310
No, of course not.
Where are you going?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.728
To see a guy
I used to hang out with.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.063
But I don't want
my dad to know.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.149
-What's the big deal?
-[chuckles]

39:19.191 --> 39:22.235
-You've seen what he's like.
-Mm.

39:22.277 --> 39:25.488
If he asks, just, uh, tell him
I went to go see a friend.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.115
-Okay.
-No.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.908
Uh, tell him

39:28.950 --> 39:30.827
I've been thinking
about Camilla

39:30.869 --> 39:33.163
and I just needed some time
to clear my head.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.664
Okay.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.624
Thanks.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.543
-Oh, hey, Monica.
-Yeah?

39:38.584 --> 39:41.171
You think
I can get Kevin's number?

39:42.005 --> 39:44.007
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

39:53.474 --> 39:56.061
-[line ringing]
-[clears throat]

39:56.102 --> 40:00.148
-[Kevin] Hello.
-Hi, Kevin. It's Ana.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.691
-You know, from--
-[Kevin] Ana!

40:01.733 --> 40:03.985
-Hey, great to hear from you.
-Hi, uh...

40:04.027 --> 40:05.695
So it was really nice
seeing you today.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.490
Uh, just wanted
to apologize to you. Um...

40:09.532 --> 40:11.243
I was really rude to...

40:11.284 --> 40:12.493
And-and nothing to do with you.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.204
[Kevin]
You weren't rude.

40:14.246 --> 40:17.082
Yeah, I was, and I'm sorry.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.542
[Kevin] Well, if being rude
results in you calling me,

40:19.584 --> 40:21.878
then by all means,
continue to be rude.

40:21.920 --> 40:26.591
-Ana.
-Oh, hi.
Just I'm on the phone.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.510
Sorry, Kevin,
can I give you a call back?

40:29.552 --> 40:31.012
[Kevin]
Yeah, sure thing.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.931
Thanks. Bye.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.145
-Is everything okay?
-Where is Monica?

40:39.187 --> 40:41.273
She just went for a drive.

40:41.314 --> 40:44.609
-With who?
-No one.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.614
She, she's been thinking
about Camilla,

40:49.655 --> 40:53.159
and I think she just needed
to be alone for a bit.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.091
[sighs]

41:08.133 --> 41:11.052
You are a good girl,
aren't you?

41:12.387 --> 41:14.847
[chuckles] Yeah.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.350
-I guess.
-[inhales sharply]

41:17.392 --> 41:21.020
It's so much harder for girls
in this world.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.648
You always have to be careful.

41:24.857 --> 41:27.277
Especially with boys.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.076
We have close friends
joining us for dinner.

41:35.118 --> 41:38.371
I'm sure Olivia would appreciate
your help in the kitchen.

41:39.205 --> 41:41.374
Sure. Of course.

41:55.263 --> 41:58.641
[birds chirping]

42:16.284 --> 42:18.911
Would you like some help,
Olivia?

42:21.873 --> 42:23.582
Camilla.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.461
No.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.672
You've come back.

42:29.714 --> 42:32.091
I was so worried.
Where have you been?

42:32.133 --> 42:35.678
Why would you worry your mother
like that?

42:41.684 --> 42:43.686
I, um...

42:43.728 --> 42:45.813
These pills that Peter give me,
they... Oh, I get so confused.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.440
-I'm sorry. Uh...
-Maybe you should lay down--

42:47.482 --> 42:48.983
No, no, no, no. I'm okay.
There's dinner.

42:49.025 --> 42:50.485
-We're-we're having guests.
-It's okay.

42:50.527 --> 42:51.986
-I'll take care of it.
-Oh. Oh, we--

42:52.028 --> 42:54.739
The girl is right, dear.

42:54.780 --> 42:57.033
-Come on now.
-Uh, well, the...

42:57.075 --> 42:58.743
The meat
is in the refrigerator.

42:58.784 --> 43:00.661
I was going to make
a-a nice pot roast.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.248
All right.
I like to cook, so...

43:04.749 --> 43:05.833
But you're sure?

43:05.875 --> 43:08.627
-[Ana] Yeah, I'm sure.
-Okay.

43:08.669 --> 43:09.879
You are a good girl.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.131
-She's-she's a good girl.
-Okay.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.259
Hm. Hm.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.389
Hey, Kevin.
Sorry about that.

43:19.431 --> 43:21.516
[Kevin on phone]
No problem.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.602
Do you know Monica's parents?

43:24.643 --> 43:26.687
[Kevin] No, the family's always
kept to themselves.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.398
Well, I never really
talked to Monica

43:28.440 --> 43:30.816
until we ran into each other
at college.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.735
-Hm.
-[Kevin] You still there?

43:32.777 --> 43:35.488
-Yeah.
-Everything okay?

43:35.530 --> 43:40.368
-Things are just a little...
bit weird.
-Weird?

43:40.410 --> 43:44.747
Sometimes, it's like her mum
and dad think I am Camilla.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.624
Well, um,
you're practically her twin.

43:46.665 --> 43:48.334
It's gotta be weird
for them, too.

43:48.376 --> 43:49.710
-That's true.
-But...

43:49.752 --> 43:51.129
If things get too weird,

43:51.170 --> 43:52.464
you-you can always come
stay with me.

43:52.505 --> 43:55.216
Like, in your own room,
I meant.

43:55.258 --> 43:56.801
I-I wasn't asking you to--

43:56.842 --> 43:58.052
[chuckles] Thanks, Kevin.

43:58.094 --> 43:59.429
Listen,
can I talk to you later?

43:59.471 --> 44:00.763
I need to make some dinner.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.807
-Yeah, sure thing.
-Okay.

44:02.848 --> 44:04.642
Thanks. Bye.

44:06.018 --> 44:09.439
[dramatic music]

44:23.744 --> 44:27.290
[instrumental music on stereo]

44:30.084 --> 44:32.504
[doorbell rings]

44:35.381 --> 44:37.467
[Peter sighs]

44:37.509 --> 44:39.218
John, Maribell,
come on in.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.595
[Eden] Hello.

44:40.637 --> 44:44.098
You look lovely.
Is this dress new?

44:44.140 --> 44:45.224
I bet you made it yourself.

44:45.266 --> 44:48.019
-Indeed, she did.
-Thank you.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.729
Hello, Lucille.

44:52.064 --> 44:53.983
I smell Olivia's
famous roast.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.486
Olivia has a new assistant
tonight.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.571
She wasn't feeling well
and had to lie down.

44:58.613 --> 45:01.824
Oh, no. Maribell,
maybe you could check on her.

45:04.661 --> 45:06.663
Hello, I'm Ana.

45:06.703 --> 45:08.665
-[Eden sighs]
-Lucille's a shy girl.

45:08.705 --> 45:10.542
Honey, you can say hello.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.877
Mm, hello.

45:12.918 --> 45:15.213
Uh, where's Monica?

45:15.254 --> 45:17.173
She needed a little time
to herself.

45:17.215 --> 45:18.715
-Have you heard from her?
-No.

45:18.757 --> 45:21.553
I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Come on in.

45:25.014 --> 45:28.560
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

45:31.521 --> 45:33.772
Pour me some wine please,
someone.

45:33.814 --> 45:37.776
Might be best to skip the wine,
dear. Your medicine.

45:39.571 --> 45:43.074
Pour me some wine.
Someone, please.

45:44.283 --> 45:47.412
Ana, dear,
would you pour me some wine?

45:50.456 --> 45:52.375
Excuse me.

45:53.750 --> 45:55.670
Thank you, love.
That's a good pour.

45:55.712 --> 45:59.382
-You pour well in Scotland.
-[laughing]

45:59.424 --> 46:01.926
-The roast is excellent.
-Mm, absolutely delicious.

46:01.967 --> 46:04.596
-You can really cook, Ana.
-Olivia had it all ready.

46:04.637 --> 46:06.889
I just,
just finished the job.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.433
Modest, too.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.393
Lucille, take note.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.440
Ana, would you hand me
the bottle, please?

46:15.481 --> 46:18.693
Olivia, you've had enough.

46:20.945 --> 46:24.365
[Olivia laughing]

46:26.200 --> 46:27.993
Ana, you're a long way
from home.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.746
Um, you miss your family?

46:29.786 --> 46:32.998
-A little bit.
-Um, well, a little bit?

46:33.040 --> 46:36.835
Yeah, I don't see my mother
very often even when I am home.

46:36.877 --> 46:38.546
Ana never knew her father.

46:38.588 --> 46:40.839
[Eden]
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Um...

46:40.881 --> 46:42.799
Is, uh, is he deceased?

46:42.841 --> 46:46.512
Um... I don't know.

46:46.554 --> 46:48.889
You know, I never really knew
my father, either.

46:48.931 --> 46:50.600
Peter's dad
took me under his wing

46:50.642 --> 46:54.353
and took up the slack,
I guess you could say.

46:54.395 --> 46:58.107
I'll forever be indebted
to this family.

46:58.149 --> 47:01.778
But, uh, for a man to abandon
his responsibilities like that

47:01.818 --> 47:04.113
is something
I can never understand.

47:04.155 --> 47:07.450
There is a lot about this world
I will never understand.

47:07.492 --> 47:09.034
Mm-hmm.

47:09.076 --> 47:11.287
Well, here's to you, Ana.

47:11.329 --> 47:14.499
You seem to be doing fine
by yourself.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.626
But always be careful, though.

47:16.668 --> 47:20.338
It just takes one misstep
to end up on that naughty list.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.132
Not, Ana. She's a good girl.

47:23.174 --> 47:25.968
-[Maribell] Oh. Oh, dear.
-Oh. John?

47:26.010 --> 47:28.179
[clears throat]

47:28.220 --> 47:30.515
-[Peter clears throat]
-Oh.

47:30.556 --> 47:31.974
-[Eden mumbles]
-[Peter] All right, all right.

47:32.016 --> 47:33.643
All right, okay.

47:33.685 --> 47:34.935
-[Olivia] Oh.
-[indistinct chatter]

47:34.977 --> 47:36.853
-I can't.
-Maribell, can you?

47:36.895 --> 47:39.607
All right,
here we go. Here.

47:39.649 --> 47:41.066
[Peter] Whoa!

47:41.108 --> 47:42.985
All right...

47:43.027 --> 47:45.613
Thank you. Thank you.

47:52.662 --> 47:54.413
[Lucille] Leave.

47:54.913 --> 47:56.624
What?

47:56.666 --> 47:58.835
Leave.

47:58.875 --> 48:00.127
[Monica]
Hey! Sorry, I'm late.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.046
My car broke down. [sighs]

48:02.087 --> 48:04.340
-Really?
-Yeah. Sucks.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.509
I got it towed to our mechanic,
but I won't find out

48:06.551 --> 48:08.927
what's wrong until tomorrow.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.805
Wow, this looks amazing!

48:10.847 --> 48:12.849
I'm starving.

48:12.889 --> 48:15.100
Hey, Lucille, what's up?

48:18.020 --> 48:20.189
[water gurgling]

48:22.274 --> 48:24.193
Sorry I left you alone
for so long.

48:24.235 --> 48:25.986
[scoffs] Can't believe
you had to do

48:26.028 --> 48:27.279
all the cooking by yourself.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.532
I don't mind.
I like helping out.

48:29.574 --> 48:32.869
You are a rock star.

48:33.661 --> 48:35.454
Lucille was acting

48:35.496 --> 48:38.499
sort of... strange.

48:38.541 --> 48:41.377
Oh, yeah? How so?

48:41.419 --> 48:43.880
She told me to leave.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.341
She's, um...

48:47.383 --> 48:49.719
[chuckles] I, uh, don't know

48:49.761 --> 48:52.597
the, uh, the politically
correct way to say it is,

48:52.638 --> 48:55.767
but, uh, Lucille's always been,

48:55.808 --> 48:59.186
uh, a little slow.

48:59.228 --> 49:02.607
Oh. Okay, now I feel bad.

49:02.648 --> 49:05.109
Don't-don't feel bad.

49:05.942 --> 49:08.153
Did you call Kevin yet?

49:09.154 --> 49:11.198
[laughs] Look at you!

49:11.240 --> 49:12.617
You really like him,
don't you?

49:12.658 --> 49:15.411
-I hardly know him.
-So get to know him.

49:15.453 --> 49:17.538
[chuckling]

49:20.792 --> 49:22.501
[cell phone chimes]

49:28.257 --> 49:30.217
[sighs]

49:33.679 --> 49:35.431
[cell phone chimes]

49:37.433 --> 49:39.101
[cell phone chimes]

49:43.230 --> 49:46.776
[instrumental music]

50:08.339 --> 50:10.215
Monica.

50:30.736 --> 50:34.281
[crickets chirping]

50:45.835 --> 50:49.254
[music continues]

50:54.134 --> 50:55.970
Hello?

51:00.098 --> 51:02.810
-[Kevin] Ana. You made it.
-[gasps]

51:02.852 --> 51:04.562
-Thanks to your pin.
-Yeah.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.898
Yeah, I-I don't know
what people did before GPS.

51:06.939 --> 51:09.525
[laughing]

51:09.567 --> 51:13.362
-Nice to see you. [giggles]
-Yeah. [chuckles]

51:13.404 --> 51:16.908
[both laughing]

51:28.126 --> 51:30.046
It's so beautiful here.

51:30.086 --> 51:32.088
Yeah.

51:32.130 --> 51:35.593
This reminds me of being a kid
and, and sneaking out at night.

51:35.634 --> 51:38.094
What would you do?

51:38.136 --> 51:41.807
I-I don't know.
Just walk around.

51:41.849 --> 51:45.394
I was a pretty boring kid,
I guess.

51:45.436 --> 51:48.522
What about you?
You ever sneak out?

51:48.564 --> 51:50.148
Didn't have to.

51:50.190 --> 51:52.693
My mum didn't care what I did.

51:52.735 --> 51:55.696
Kind of takes the fun
out of doing something bad.

51:56.614 --> 51:59.366
[chuckles] Yeah.

51:59.408 --> 52:03.203
Growing up, I was always jealous
of the kids who lived over here.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.872
How come?

52:04.914 --> 52:06.624
It just seems so perfect.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.834
All this space.

52:08.876 --> 52:12.212
My neighborhood
is a little different.

52:12.254 --> 52:14.130
We're literally
on the wrong side

52:14.172 --> 52:16.216
of the railroad tracks.

52:17.676 --> 52:20.429
Maybe the more perfect

52:20.471 --> 52:22.765
a place seems,

52:22.807 --> 52:25.392
the more secrets it's hiding.

52:27.394 --> 52:28.771
Interesting.

52:28.813 --> 52:30.481
Is this theory

52:30.522 --> 52:33.692
based on your experiences
in Fallbrook?

52:33.734 --> 52:36.612
Maybe. [laughing]

52:36.654 --> 52:38.656
I feel like
you have some juicy gossip,

52:38.697 --> 52:41.117
but you're too much
of a good girl to share it.

52:41.157 --> 52:43.285
Ugh! [laughs]

52:43.327 --> 52:45.955
What? What did I say?

52:45.997 --> 52:50.166
Uh, "Good girl."
I'm tired of hearing that.

52:50.208 --> 52:52.086
[both laughing]

52:52.128 --> 52:54.005
Point taken.

52:54.046 --> 52:57.549
[instrumental music]

53:10.062 --> 53:12.982
There's something
I'd like to tell you.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.942
The, um...

53:14.984 --> 53:17.778
The reason
that Monica and I came here

53:17.820 --> 53:20.280
is because someone was, sort of,
stalking me back at school.

53:20.322 --> 53:24.035
Stalking you?
Oh, that's, that's horrible.

53:24.076 --> 53:26.537
-I'm sorry, Ana.
-It's made me paranoid.

53:26.578 --> 53:29.123
I'm tryin' to get over it,
but it's not easy.

53:29.165 --> 53:31.876
-[Zelda] Who's out there?
-[Ana gasps]

53:32.626 --> 53:35.129
-Hello?
-Shh!

53:37.339 --> 53:40.134
You are on private property.

53:40.176 --> 53:42.218
And I have a gun.

53:42.260 --> 53:45.430
[dramatic music]

53:56.901 --> 53:59.028
[instrumental music]

54:00.278 --> 54:03.074
Well, that added some excitement
to the evening.

54:03.115 --> 54:05.826
[laughing]

54:07.203 --> 54:11.540
[inhales sharply]
Thanks for coming out.

54:29.183 --> 54:31.643
[sighs]

54:54.583 --> 54:56.919
[door creaking]

55:03.467 --> 55:05.970
[gasps]

55:06.011 --> 55:07.972
Why did you sneak out?

55:10.557 --> 55:12.308
I...

55:12.350 --> 55:14.728
I didn't sneak out.

55:17.439 --> 55:19.441
What were you doing out there?

55:19.483 --> 55:22.236
-Walking.
-With who?

55:24.238 --> 55:26.448
Please leave me alone.

55:28.617 --> 55:31.829
I'd like to be
alone right now.

55:31.870 --> 55:33.289
You're making me
uncomfortable.

55:33.329 --> 55:34.372
While you're under my roof,

55:34.414 --> 55:35.499
you will abide by my rules.

55:35.540 --> 55:37.375
Is that clear?

55:45.801 --> 55:47.761
I'm sorry I startled you.

55:47.803 --> 55:51.307
I'm just... trying
to look out for you.

55:55.936 --> 55:58.480
I still think
you're a good girl.

56:12.828 --> 56:15.122
[Monica on radio] Ana?

56:18.917 --> 56:20.752
Mm.

56:23.172 --> 56:26.217
-Yeah. I'm here.
-[Monica] I'm sorry.

56:26.258 --> 56:28.052
He had no right to say

56:28.093 --> 56:30.595
whatever the hell
he just said to you.

56:30.637 --> 56:32.931
God,
I hope it wasn't too nuts.

56:32.973 --> 56:35.851
You must think we're all crazy.

56:35.893 --> 56:39.646
[sighs] I didn't call
anyone crazy.

56:39.688 --> 56:41.732
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

56:41.773 --> 56:43.650
Okay. Goodnight.

56:43.692 --> 56:45.443
Goodnight.

56:50.532 --> 56:53.952
[birds chirping]

57:00.334 --> 57:02.169
So what do you think?

57:02.211 --> 57:05.797
How are you feeling
about everything?

57:08.050 --> 57:10.094
I want to leave.

57:11.095 --> 57:14.765
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

57:14.806 --> 57:19.144
What if I talk to my dad?
I'm sure I can get him
to apologize.

57:21.063 --> 57:25.192
My parents have never recovered
from losing Camilla.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.946
They blame themselves.

57:28.987 --> 57:30.239
And my dad means well.

57:30.281 --> 57:33.284
He's just being
overprotective.

57:33.325 --> 57:36.954
Not that that excuses
his behavior.

57:36.995 --> 57:40.249
I'm sorry, Monica, I'm just
not comfortable here anymore.

57:41.417 --> 57:44.502
Besides, I can't hide
from this stalker forever.

57:46.463 --> 57:49.633
I appreciate you bringing me
here. I really do.

57:50.759 --> 57:53.011
It's time for me to go back.

57:55.680 --> 57:57.182
Okay.

57:57.224 --> 58:00.102
But I still have to get
my car fixed first.

58:00.144 --> 58:01.519
Well, you shouldn't
have to drive me

58:01.561 --> 58:03.688
if you're not ready to leave.

58:03.730 --> 58:04.982
Just...

58:05.023 --> 58:07.109
Well, I'll get an Uber
or something.

58:07.151 --> 58:10.154
Even if you could get a driver
to come all the way out here,

58:10.195 --> 58:13.031
which is highly doubtful,

58:13.073 --> 58:16.201
do you know how expensive
that would be?

58:21.415 --> 58:24.335
Geez, Ana.
He's not some monster.

58:24.376 --> 58:27.796
-I didn't say that.
-Whatever.

58:29.131 --> 58:31.508
Okay. Hold on a sec.

58:39.766 --> 58:43.187
[birds chirping]

58:54.823 --> 58:58.576
Okay. My dad's going to take me
over to the mechanic's now.

58:58.618 --> 58:59.953
They're buddies,
and my dad says

58:59.995 --> 59:01.372
he'll work faster
if we pressure him.

59:01.413 --> 59:02.873
Well, okay,
you don't have to do that.

59:02.914 --> 59:04.458
I don't mind waiting.

59:04.500 --> 59:06.210
Clearly you do.

59:06.251 --> 59:08.086
Monica.

59:09.838 --> 59:13.300
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

59:14.676 --> 59:16.470
It's okay, Ana.

59:18.138 --> 59:20.598
I'm just embarrassed...

59:21.850 --> 59:24.269
and disappointed.

59:29.858 --> 59:33.404
[instrumental music]

59:49.127 --> 59:50.670
[door shuts]

59:53.131 --> 59:56.176
Monica told me what happened.

59:58.429 --> 1:00:01.014
[sighs]

1:00:01.056 --> 1:00:03.892
The night Camilla died...

1:00:03.934 --> 1:00:06.937
she snuck out to go
for a ride with Greta

1:00:06.978 --> 1:00:08.897
and, uh...

1:00:09.898 --> 1:00:11.649
Hm.

1:00:12.984 --> 1:00:14.652
Well, you know how men are.

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:16.613
And they just
wanna fix everything.

1:00:16.654 --> 1:00:20.909
And I think that with you
looking so much like Camilla

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:23.995
and going out at night time
like you did,

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:27.249
I-I think that perhaps it was
just a little too much for Peter

1:00:27.291 --> 1:00:29.501
to deal with properly.

1:00:29.543 --> 1:00:31.002
Yes?

1:00:31.044 --> 1:00:32.879
And, um...

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:35.090
I owe you an apology as well.

1:00:35.132 --> 1:00:36.550
No, you don't.

1:00:36.592 --> 1:00:40.220
Ana, I, uh, I know
that I scared you yesterday,

1:00:40.262 --> 1:00:43.348
and for that I'm sorry.

1:00:43.390 --> 1:00:47.936
I am, uh, I'm trying
different medications.

1:00:47.978 --> 1:00:49.438
Hm.

1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:52.899
As if a pill
would bring back Camilla.

1:00:52.941 --> 1:00:55.486
[Olivia chuckles]

1:00:55.527 --> 1:00:57.446
A-anyway, they, um,

1:00:57.488 --> 1:01:00.449
they make me
a little bit loopy. [chuckles]

1:01:00.491 --> 1:01:03.368
Olivia, it's okay,
really, um...

1:01:03.410 --> 1:01:05.662
You guys have been so nice
to me.

1:01:05.703 --> 1:01:07.539
I've just been...

1:01:07.581 --> 1:01:09.916
I've just been dealing
with my own problems.

1:01:09.958 --> 1:01:11.751
That's, that's all.

1:01:11.793 --> 1:01:13.920
Of course you are, dear.

1:01:14.879 --> 1:01:16.548
Well, I do hope
that you would, uh,

1:01:16.590 --> 1:01:19.593
perhaps reconsider
staying here a bit longer.

1:01:19.635 --> 1:01:21.970
No pressure, of course.

1:01:22.012 --> 1:01:24.431
I think I'm gonna do
some studying.

1:01:24.473 --> 1:01:27.601
Okay. You could do it out here
if you would like.

1:01:27.643 --> 1:01:29.478
I'll move my stuff.

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:31.522
And I could use the company.

1:01:31.563 --> 1:01:33.273
Okay.

1:01:40.989 --> 1:01:44.535
[instrumental music]

1:01:48.121 --> 1:01:50.666
Olivia, do you have another pen
that I could use?

1:01:50.707 --> 1:01:53.502
Uh, why don't you try
Monica's room?

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:55.212
Okay.

1:01:55.253 --> 1:01:57.755
Should I start some lunch?

1:01:57.797 --> 1:01:59.757
Sure, sounds good.

1:02:00.217 --> 1:02:02.135
All right.

1:02:14.481 --> 1:02:17.901
[music continues]

1:02:39.923 --> 1:02:42.884
[intense music]

1:02:42.926 --> 1:02:45.053
[gasps]

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:53.811
[Camilla] Monica,
I'm leaving tonight with Greta

1:02:53.853 --> 1:02:57.357
and I'm not coming back.
I can't take it anymore.

1:02:57.399 --> 1:02:58.900
There's something not right

1:02:58.942 --> 1:03:01.152
about Dad
and it's only getting worse.

1:03:01.194 --> 1:03:03.905
He changed the lock on my door
so I can't get out.

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:05.699
It's-it's like I'm a prisoner.

1:03:05.741 --> 1:03:09.160
He's telling me how I need
to be a good girl again.

1:03:09.202 --> 1:03:10.954
I'm not gonna end up
like Lucille.

1:03:10.995 --> 1:03:13.624
I can't trust anyone
but you and Greta.

1:03:13.665 --> 1:03:16.793
Just lay low and try to act
like a good girl

1:03:16.834 --> 1:03:19.463
so Mom and Dad
leave you alone for now.

1:03:19.504 --> 1:03:21.632
I'll contact you when I can.

1:03:21.673 --> 1:03:23.508
I love you so much.

1:03:23.550 --> 1:03:25.385
Love, Camilla.

1:03:25.427 --> 1:03:29.723
-[Olivia] Lunch time!
-[Ana gasps]

1:03:29.765 --> 1:03:32.309
Oh, my goodness.
I scared you again, sweetheart.

1:03:32.350 --> 1:03:34.894
I'm so sorry.
Did you find one?

1:03:34.936 --> 1:03:36.438
What?

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:39.232
-A pen?
-Yeah.

1:03:40.525 --> 1:03:42.235
[Olivia] Good.

1:03:42.277 --> 1:03:43.779
Our tuna sandwiches are ready.

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:45.113
White bread, no crusts.

1:03:45.155 --> 1:03:46.698
[instrumental music]

1:03:46.740 --> 1:03:50.034
Just how you like it. Hm.

1:04:05.216 --> 1:04:07.010
Aren't you eating?

1:04:20.607 --> 1:04:22.150
Yummy.

1:04:24.319 --> 1:04:26.571
Don't forget your milk.

1:04:29.491 --> 1:04:31.117
It's good for strong bones.

1:04:31.159 --> 1:04:33.077
Oh, how I used to worry

1:04:33.119 --> 1:04:34.496
that you weren't getting
enough milk

1:04:34.538 --> 1:04:36.748
when you were little.

1:04:39.917 --> 1:04:41.837
Go on.

1:04:44.422 --> 1:04:47.925
[intense music]

1:04:53.306 --> 1:04:55.642
[gasping]

1:04:55.684 --> 1:04:57.728
I'm so sorry.

1:04:57.769 --> 1:05:01.231
It's okay.
I'll, I will get a towel.

1:05:01.272 --> 1:05:03.567
I'm so sorry.
I don't feel so good.

1:05:03.608 --> 1:05:06.194
I'm gonna lie down for a nap.

1:05:14.745 --> 1:05:16.120
[Ana] Camilla ran away
because her parents

1:05:16.162 --> 1:05:17.581
were gonna lock her up
in her room.

1:05:17.622 --> 1:05:19.082
They didn't want her
to grow up, Kevin.

1:05:19.123 --> 1:05:21.334
[Kevin on phone] Okay.

1:05:21.376 --> 1:05:22.544
You don't believe me.

1:05:22.586 --> 1:05:23.628
You're joking, right?

1:05:23.670 --> 1:05:24.880
I mean, that sounds--

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:26.381
Crazy. I know.

1:05:26.423 --> 1:05:27.591
They're trying to trap me
in here, Kevin.

1:05:27.632 --> 1:05:30.301
-Why?
-To replace Camilla.

1:05:30.343 --> 1:05:32.929
Monica's mum thinks
I am Camilla right now.

1:05:32.970 --> 1:05:34.806
And there was no stalker.

1:05:34.848 --> 1:05:37.975
It was Monica.
She did it to get me out here.

1:05:38.017 --> 1:05:39.895
They did it.
They planned altogether.

1:05:39.936 --> 1:05:42.522
If that's true, you should
call the police, Ana.

1:05:42.564 --> 1:05:44.858
I can't.
Sheriff Eden's in on it, too.

1:05:44.900 --> 1:05:47.068
-Sheriff Eden?
-Yeah.

1:05:47.110 --> 1:05:48.528
Look, whether or not
you believe it,

1:05:48.570 --> 1:05:50.238
I just need, I need your help.

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:51.573
Can you meet me in the meadow?

1:05:51.615 --> 1:05:53.742
-Yeah, okay. I'll leave now.
-Okay.

1:05:53.784 --> 1:05:55.744
Thanks, Kevin.

1:05:58.747 --> 1:06:00.874
[grunting]

1:06:02.959 --> 1:06:04.294
[grunting]

1:06:04.335 --> 1:06:05.712
-[gasps]
-Bad girl.

1:06:05.754 --> 1:06:07.297
What did I say
about sneaking out?

1:06:07.338 --> 1:06:09.048
[grunts]

1:06:10.007 --> 1:06:13.511
[intense music]

1:06:18.182 --> 1:06:21.645
[panting]

1:06:37.034 --> 1:06:39.287
[car engine starts]

1:06:40.204 --> 1:06:42.791
-What are you doing?
-[gasps]

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:45.209
Where are they going?

1:06:48.379 --> 1:06:51.174
-Let go of me.
-Wait. I can help you.

1:06:51.215 --> 1:06:52.717
[grunts]

1:06:57.180 --> 1:07:00.224
-Kevin. Oh!
-Hey.

1:07:00.266 --> 1:07:02.936
Thank you for coming.
I know how crazy I must sound.

1:07:02.978 --> 1:07:05.271
Ah, you don't feel safe.
That's all that matters.

1:07:05.313 --> 1:07:08.692
-Monica's dad tried to stop me.
-What?

1:07:09.651 --> 1:07:11.068
Are you serious?

1:07:11.110 --> 1:07:12.236
We need to hurry.

1:07:12.278 --> 1:07:14.739
Come on,
let's get out of here.

1:07:17.951 --> 1:07:19.828
I passed Sheriff Eden
on my way here.

1:07:19.870 --> 1:07:20.954
He's looking for me.

1:07:20.996 --> 1:07:22.038
It's hard for me to believe

1:07:22.079 --> 1:07:23.039
he'd be involved in this,

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:24.290
but he did bust me

1:07:24.332 --> 1:07:25.792
for drinking beer
when I was 15,

1:07:25.834 --> 1:07:28.962
so I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt.

1:07:29.004 --> 1:07:31.047
Hey, don't worry.

1:07:31.088 --> 1:07:32.799
We're gonna get out of here.

1:07:32.841 --> 1:07:36.011
-I can't let the sheriff see me.
-You should get in the back.

1:07:36.052 --> 1:07:38.889
You can keep down
until we get to town.

1:07:53.820 --> 1:07:56.113
[engine starts]

1:07:59.034 --> 1:08:01.327
-[Kevin] Uh-oh.
-What?

1:08:01.369 --> 1:08:03.454
Sheriff Eden
is heading toward us.

1:08:03.496 --> 1:08:05.040
Just stay down.

1:08:09.168 --> 1:08:11.838
Okay. [sighs]
We passed him.

1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:14.090
He did seem like
he was looking for someone.

1:08:14.131 --> 1:08:15.425
Starting to believe me?

1:08:15.466 --> 1:08:18.094
I never said
I didn't believe you.

1:08:18.135 --> 1:08:21.389
True. Sorry.
This is all sort of new for me.

1:08:21.431 --> 1:08:24.017
Me, too. Kind of exciting.

1:08:26.770 --> 1:08:30.273
[eerie music]

1:08:34.402 --> 1:08:37.113
-I said no peeking.
-[gasping]

1:08:37.154 --> 1:08:40.241
-I thought you were a good girl.
-You, too?

1:08:40.283 --> 1:08:43.828
Who do you think was following
you the night you met Monica?

1:08:43.870 --> 1:08:46.414
-You planned this together.
-Camilla was my girlfriend.

1:08:46.456 --> 1:08:48.917
We were meant
to be together.

1:08:48.959 --> 1:08:50.877
But she stopped
being a good girl.

1:08:50.919 --> 1:08:54.171
Monica never was a good girl.
She's a lost cause.

1:08:54.213 --> 1:08:58.093
But it doesn't matter
because I just want you.

1:08:58.134 --> 1:08:59.719
[chuckles] No, no, no,
don't get the wrong idea.

1:08:59.761 --> 1:09:01.429
Peter and Olivia
will take care of you.

1:09:01.471 --> 1:09:04.057
I just want the chance
to get to know you.

1:09:04.099 --> 1:09:06.517
You know, without all
the distractions of the city,

1:09:06.559 --> 1:09:09.270
it'll be completely innocent.

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:11.731
The way
things are supposed to be.

1:09:15.276 --> 1:09:17.904
[breathing heavily]

1:09:17.946 --> 1:09:20.573
[tires screeching]

1:09:22.283 --> 1:09:25.662
[dramatic music]

1:09:29.540 --> 1:09:31.751
[whimpers] No. No.

1:09:31.793 --> 1:09:35.171
-Well done, Kevin.
-Thanks, Dad.

1:09:36.965 --> 1:09:38.341
[Ana panting]

1:09:38.382 --> 1:09:40.343
-Stay away from me.
-[Eden] Calm down.

1:09:40.384 --> 1:09:43.179
-[Eden] Please, Camilla.
-[Ana] Ah, don't call me that!

1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:45.807
Why are you doing this?
You're supposed to help people.

1:09:45.849 --> 1:09:47.266
I'm trying to help you.
Wait, wait.

1:09:47.308 --> 1:09:49.019
[shushing] Listen, listen.

1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:51.896
Peter's father taught us that
the most important job a man has

1:09:51.938 --> 1:09:54.565
is to protect his family
and women, most of all.

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:57.485
There is no safer place
than right here.

1:09:57.527 --> 1:10:00.279
He's right, Camilla.
It's a sick world out there.

1:10:00.321 --> 1:10:02.532
One day you will understand.

1:10:02.573 --> 1:10:04.325
[sobbing] No. No...

1:10:04.367 --> 1:10:07.787
-It's okay, I'm a doctor.
-No, no, no... Please, please...

1:10:11.415 --> 1:10:13.334
[echoing] Kevin...

1:10:18.339 --> 1:10:20.508
Don't worry. You're gonna be
my sweetheart again, Camilla.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:24.054
Don't frighten the poor girl.
Kevin will visit.

1:10:24.095 --> 1:10:25.680
But it will be up to you
whether or not

1:10:25.722 --> 1:10:26.931
you want to spend time with him.

1:10:26.973 --> 1:10:28.141
Under my supervision, of course.

1:10:28.183 --> 1:10:29.517
It's all right,
I've raised Kevin

1:10:29.559 --> 1:10:31.394
to be very respectful of women.

1:10:31.435 --> 1:10:33.146
[Olivia]
It's okay, sweetheart.

1:10:33.188 --> 1:10:35.231
We're doing this all for you
because we all

1:10:35.272 --> 1:10:37.067
love you so much, Camilla.

1:10:51.081 --> 1:10:54.458
[dramatic music]

1:11:00.965 --> 1:11:03.467
[hammering]

1:11:08.723 --> 1:11:10.850
[hammering]

1:11:10.892 --> 1:11:12.810
[Ana gasps]

1:11:27.491 --> 1:11:30.828
[doorknob rattling]

1:11:39.670 --> 1:11:41.131
[music continues]

1:11:41.172 --> 1:11:43.549
-Oh, good, you're up.
-How are you feeling?

1:11:43.591 --> 1:11:45.593
You must be hungry.
I made your favorite.

1:11:45.635 --> 1:11:48.972
-I hate tuna fish.
-Don't say that, Camilla.

1:11:49.013 --> 1:11:51.390
I'm not Camilla.
Listen to my voice.

1:11:51.432 --> 1:11:52.976
Do I sound like
Camilla to you?

1:11:53.017 --> 1:11:54.560
You will not talk
to your mother like that.

1:11:54.602 --> 1:11:56.604
-She's not!
-Silence!

1:11:56.646 --> 1:12:00.399
Do not speak. Listen!
Understand?

1:12:00.441 --> 1:12:03.236
For now you will be
confined to your room.

1:12:03.278 --> 1:12:05.696
You will have
everything you need.

1:12:05.738 --> 1:12:07.698
You will think about escaping,
of course,

1:12:07.740 --> 1:12:10.493
but I warn you not to try.
It won't work.

1:12:10.534 --> 1:12:13.788
And the punishment
will be very severe.

1:12:13.830 --> 1:12:16.249
Once you've re-earned
our trust,

1:12:16.291 --> 1:12:18.960
you'll be able to use
the rest of the house again.

1:12:19.002 --> 1:12:22.213
And if that goes well,
maybe even outside.

1:12:22.546 --> 1:12:24.757
Let me go.

1:12:24.799 --> 1:12:27.343
-You can't do this.
-We are doing this.

1:12:27.384 --> 1:12:29.637
It's for your own good,
Camilla.

1:12:29.679 --> 1:12:31.764
[music continues]

1:12:31.806 --> 1:12:35.768
-Stay away from me.
-Do not make me restrain you.

1:12:35.810 --> 1:12:39.396
Take this, honey.
It will calm you down.

1:12:41.191 --> 1:12:43.400
It's the pill
or the needle again.

1:12:43.442 --> 1:12:45.028
Your choice.

1:13:03.754 --> 1:13:05.422
Open up.

1:13:07.258 --> 1:13:09.802
Open your mouth.

1:13:20.063 --> 1:13:21.898
Olivia.

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:31.157
[door shuts]

1:13:36.329 --> 1:13:39.707
[dramatic music]

1:13:46.005 --> 1:13:47.882
[inhales sharply]

1:13:51.094 --> 1:13:53.596
Rise and shine, sweetheart!

1:13:53.637 --> 1:13:56.599
[chuckles] Oh, sleepyhead.

1:13:57.433 --> 1:14:00.270
Brought you some breakfast.

1:14:00.603 --> 1:14:02.146
[sighs]

1:14:02.188 --> 1:14:04.023
All right.

1:14:04.065 --> 1:14:06.734
Camilla, you didn't finish
your tuna sandwich, young lady.

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:09.279
Don't make me bring
your father in here.

1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:12.323
[sighs] Come. Listen...

1:14:13.574 --> 1:14:15.243
Camilla!

1:14:17.245 --> 1:14:18.913
Camilla, don't...

1:14:18.955 --> 1:14:21.374
[grunting]

1:14:22.417 --> 1:14:23.500
[Olivia] Open the door, Camilla.

1:14:23.542 --> 1:14:24.460
All this will do is make

1:14:24.501 --> 1:14:26.045
your father very angry.

1:14:26.087 --> 1:14:28.131
You can't get away from here,
sweetheart.

1:14:28.172 --> 1:14:29.548
We'll find you.

1:14:29.590 --> 1:14:32.051
Peter! Peter, help!

1:14:32.093 --> 1:14:35.346
She got out! Peter, help!

1:14:35.388 --> 1:14:38.099
Help! Help!

1:14:38.141 --> 1:14:40.268
Help!

1:14:40.310 --> 1:14:42.561
She got out, Peter!

1:14:42.603 --> 1:14:44.897
[Ana]
Yes, I need help.

1:14:44.939 --> 1:14:46.523
Yes, this is an emergency.

1:14:46.565 --> 1:14:49.235
[Peter] Okay, Camilla,
that's enough.

1:14:49.277 --> 1:14:51.695
[Ana] ...right away.
They locked me up.

1:14:53.030 --> 1:14:54.698
[Peter gasps]

1:14:56.909 --> 1:15:00.413
[intense music]

1:15:02.165 --> 1:15:04.459
[panting]

1:15:07.586 --> 1:15:08.629
[Ana whimpering]

1:15:08.671 --> 1:15:10.673
-Calm down. Calm down.
-No!

1:15:10.714 --> 1:15:14.344
-No!
-Silly girl.

1:15:14.385 --> 1:15:15.886
Even if you'd gotten away,
I'd just send

1:15:15.928 --> 1:15:18.555
Sheriff Eden after you.
You're never getting away.

1:15:18.597 --> 1:15:19.932
You need to accept that,
Camilla.

1:15:19.974 --> 1:15:23.144
-[gun cocks]
-She's not Camilla.

1:15:23.186 --> 1:15:26.022
-Zelda?
-She's not Camilla.

1:15:26.063 --> 1:15:28.483
You need to accept that, Peter.
Hands up.

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:31.861
-Listen to me.
-Hands up!

1:15:33.363 --> 1:15:36.032
Get in the truck.
Get out of here.

1:15:36.073 --> 1:15:38.159
I won't let him send anyone
after you.

1:15:38.201 --> 1:15:40.453
I didn't know what
they were planning, any of them.

1:15:40.495 --> 1:15:43.331
And I don't know you, but I know
you don't deserve this.

1:15:43.373 --> 1:15:45.791
No one does.

1:15:45.833 --> 1:15:48.669
You come any closer, you will
make a murderer out of me,

1:15:48.711 --> 1:15:50.046
Peter Jansen.

1:15:50.087 --> 1:15:52.923
I swear on the soul
of my dear Greta.

1:15:52.965 --> 1:15:54.425
Go on!

1:15:54.467 --> 1:15:56.302
Thank you.

1:15:59.596 --> 1:16:02.099
[car engine starts]

1:16:27.124 --> 1:16:30.711
[instrumental music]

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:46.810
[dog barking in distance]

1:16:52.691 --> 1:16:55.236
[Ana] I thought
you were my friend.

1:17:00.157 --> 1:17:02.326
Family comes first.

1:17:02.368 --> 1:17:05.329
You were just gonna let them
lock me up.

1:17:07.831 --> 1:17:11.668
How can you do that...
to anyone?

1:17:13.254 --> 1:17:15.506
I have my reasons.

1:17:17.341 --> 1:17:19.302
Have you called the cops?

1:17:19.343 --> 1:17:20.886
I bet your story
will be a little hard

1:17:20.928 --> 1:17:23.180
for them to swallow.

1:17:23.222 --> 1:17:25.433
I want my life back.

1:17:25.475 --> 1:17:27.768
You're too late, Ana.

1:17:28.394 --> 1:17:30.729
[grunting]

1:17:32.689 --> 1:17:35.067
I'm right on time.

1:17:50.458 --> 1:17:53.294
[footsteps approaching]

1:17:54.753 --> 1:17:56.797
Camilla?

1:18:00.343 --> 1:18:04.514
It was Greta
who died in the crash.

1:18:04.555 --> 1:18:05.598
Wasn't it?

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.143
[mellow music]

1:18:10.102 --> 1:18:13.230
Zelda found me.

1:18:13.272 --> 1:18:17.734
She made it look like
I was the one who died.

1:18:19.195 --> 1:18:23.533
She lost Greta,
but she saved me.

1:18:24.534 --> 1:18:27.036
Monica got an idea.

1:18:28.204 --> 1:18:32.416
She made a deal with your dad,
didn't she?

1:18:37.296 --> 1:18:40.466
If he let her go to the city,

1:18:40.508 --> 1:18:43.219
she would find
a replacement for you.

1:18:46.096 --> 1:18:51.185
I was always their favorite.

1:18:51.227 --> 1:18:54.271
They didn't even
try to hide it.

1:18:54.313 --> 1:18:58.484
So if Monica could find someone
who looked like me,

1:18:58.526 --> 1:19:02.071
they could have
their perfect good girl back.

1:19:03.656 --> 1:19:06.742
We never thought
she would find someone

1:19:06.783 --> 1:19:10.413
who looks so much like me.

1:19:10.454 --> 1:19:14.833
And when she found you,
it seemed like
it was meant to be.

1:19:16.460 --> 1:19:19.380
At least
that's what we told ourselves.

1:19:19.963 --> 1:19:22.925
Everybody wins, right?

1:19:22.966 --> 1:19:25.720
-Everybody except me.
-I know it's no excuse.

1:19:25.761 --> 1:19:30.433
But we had
a pretty messed-up childhood.

1:19:30.474 --> 1:19:34.604
You're right.
It's not an excuse.

1:19:34.645 --> 1:19:38.941
And you're not the only ones
who had a rough childhood.

1:19:38.982 --> 1:19:43.153
None of us wanted to end up
like our mothers, huh?

1:19:53.163 --> 1:19:56.375
Well, she was just
trying to help me.

1:19:56.417 --> 1:19:59.295
She's always tried to help me.

1:20:00.588 --> 1:20:04.300
You didn't deserve
any of this.

1:20:04.341 --> 1:20:07.261
So what was the final part
of the plan?

1:20:07.303 --> 1:20:12.099
Monica would...
escape to the city

1:20:12.141 --> 1:20:15.561
and you would, what?

1:20:15.603 --> 1:20:19.523
Steal my identity
and ride off into the sunset?

1:20:22.901 --> 1:20:24.695
[sniffles]

1:20:26.989 --> 1:20:28.699
To Scotland.

1:20:29.533 --> 1:20:31.702
My passport.

1:20:32.953 --> 1:20:36.582
[sniffles]
I have a ticket

1:20:36.624 --> 1:20:40.043
on a plane
that leaves in three hours.

1:20:40.085 --> 1:20:44.632
I was gonna just...
start over.

1:20:46.717 --> 1:20:48.969
[Camilla sniffles]

1:21:00.147 --> 1:21:02.525
Maybe it is possible.

1:21:04.026 --> 1:21:07.321
What if you took that flight?

1:21:07.363 --> 1:21:09.699
I'll report my passport
missing, eventually.

1:21:09.740 --> 1:21:11.617
But I'll leave you enough time
to get over there

1:21:11.659 --> 1:21:13.577
and get settled.

1:21:13.869 --> 1:21:15.996
Why?

1:21:16.038 --> 1:21:17.914
Why would you do that?

1:21:17.956 --> 1:21:20.876
Let's just say
I know what it's like

1:21:20.917 --> 1:21:23.462
to need to start over.

1:21:27.550 --> 1:21:30.720
Scotland's a lovely country.
I think you'll like it.

1:21:34.348 --> 1:21:37.560
I'm gonna stick around here
for a little while.

1:21:39.770 --> 1:21:42.272
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:21:42.981 --> 1:21:45.401
I don't scare so easily.

1:21:45.442 --> 1:21:48.945
Besides, I need to file
a report with social services

1:21:48.987 --> 1:21:51.741
about Lucille.

1:21:51.782 --> 1:21:54.660
I'm not going anywhere
until she's free.

1:22:00.957 --> 1:22:03.210
So what do you say?

1:22:03.252 --> 1:22:06.338
It'll be
a true foreign exchange.

1:22:06.963 --> 1:22:09.216
I...

1:22:09.258 --> 1:22:10.509
I don't know what to say.

1:22:10.551 --> 1:22:12.469
Then don't say anything.

1:22:13.178 --> 1:22:15.556
You have a plane to catch.

1:22:19.810 --> 1:22:21.771
She'll be fine.

1:22:36.619 --> 1:22:38.537
[Camilla] Bye, Monica.

1:22:40.915 --> 1:22:42.833
I love you.

1:22:52.259 --> 1:22:55.805
[instrumental music]

1:23:10.861 --> 1:23:12.529
[groans]

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:19.578
Here. Take it.

1:23:26.335 --> 1:23:28.211
[Ana] Camilla's gone.

1:23:28.253 --> 1:23:30.756
She says that she loves you.

1:23:31.757 --> 1:23:34.092
You need to start packing.

1:23:34.927 --> 1:23:37.304
Well,
I'm taking your apartment.

1:23:37.346 --> 1:23:40.307
Your family will keep paying
the bills, though.

1:23:40.349 --> 1:23:42.977
It's the least
you guys can do, right?

1:23:46.814 --> 1:23:50.526
You must be hungry.
How would you like your eggs?

1:23:51.694 --> 1:23:53.195
Scrambled.

1:23:53.236 --> 1:23:54.780
Perfect.

1:23:54.822 --> 1:23:56.365
Me, too.

1:24:08.043 --> 1:24:11.547
[instrumental music]

1:24:40.034 --> 1:24:43.453
[music continues]

1:25:05.809 --> 1:25:09.187
[dramatic music]

1:25:38.008 --> 1:25:41.428
[music continues]

1:25:56.443 --> 1:25:59.195
[music fades]
