WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:03.304
You're teaming up
with the guys from Ghosted.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.039
I could have died
in there!

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Aw, somebody
need a hug?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.642
Catch all-new episodes Sundays.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.244
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.278 --> 00:13.081
The Orville, Gotham,
and Lucifer.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.548
Remember me?

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.389
I'm not going anywhere
without finding this ghost.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.391
Chaz, you're out of your mind,
and I love it.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.025
My mind was lost
a long time ago.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.094
Oh, my God!

00:26.127 --> 00:28.028
-(screams)
-Be gone!

00:30.064 --> 00:31.899
My K-2 meter
is extremely active.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.602
We are definitely experiencing
some spectral activity.

00:34.635 --> 00:38.038
Uh, you think? It's the ghost
of old Nurse Stevens.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.108
Nurse Stevens, can you hear us?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.742
We come in the name
of love and peace.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.244
Oh! Oh!

00:43.277 --> 00:45.713
That wheelchair's rolling by
on its own.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.915
That is a scientific
impossibility.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.250
This is not normal.

00:49.283 --> 00:53.221
No. It feels... paranormal.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.695
-(creaking)
-(both screaming)

01:01.729 --> 01:04.365
No. No. No. No.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.400
These are the Ghost Studz.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.369
As you can see,
there's very little substance

01:08.402 --> 01:10.037
to their "findings."

01:10.070 --> 01:12.273
Ghost Studz?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.808
I mean, these clowns give
real paranormal investigators

01:14.842 --> 01:16.777
like me and Leroy a bad name.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.547
-More like Ghost Dudz.
-(laughs)

01:19.580 --> 01:21.115
Good one? All right, cool.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.917
(imitates explosion)

01:23.951 --> 01:25.819
-No, thanks.
-Cool.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.921
Mmm. You can actually see
the fan that they used

01:27.955 --> 01:30.558
to blow out the lantern.
Like, the fan is in the shot.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.226
Fake-ass, clown-ass,
Hollywood rubbish.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.627
LEROY: Yeah, but these
Hollywood dudes

01:33.661 --> 01:35.896
got it made in the shade.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.266
My cop buddy Josh
was a consultant

01:38.299 --> 01:41.302
on Mysteries of Laura--
perks for days.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.304
Hung out with the actors, free
food, and when it was all over,

01:43.337 --> 01:46.474
everybody got a jacket.
Everybody.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.409
Yeah, but we're the real thing.
We don't need perks.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.444
Au contraire, mon frÃ¨re.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.013
We do need the perks, and I will
start with these chairs.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.784
I'm tired of sitting all low
like a baby child.

01:56.817 --> 02:00.954
These idiots on their fake show
seem to have stumbled

02:00.988 --> 02:04.825
upon a real paranormal phenomena
when they began filming

02:04.858 --> 02:06.294
at Highguard Mental Hospital.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.128
Wait, that's that place
that was doing,

02:08.162 --> 02:11.432
like, crazy experiments
on people back in the '80s.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.167
Exactly.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.204
-Ugh.
-Oy.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.672
This could be a very,
very dangerous place.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.040
Uh... yeah.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.343
I need Max and Leroy
to go undercover

02:22.376 --> 02:23.844
and make sure that no harm comes

02:23.877 --> 02:25.379
to these stupid, stupid people.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.980
MAX:
You know what?

02:27.014 --> 02:29.683
I think this is a call
for the real ghost studs.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.953
Me and Leroy.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.688
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.824
Yeah, we're the new,
we're the new ones.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.792
(clears throat)
Does that makes sense?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.828
*

02:44.732 --> 02:47.668
MAX: I've never been
on the set of a TV show before.

02:49.437 --> 02:52.473
Leroy, why are you pressed up
against the steering wheel?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.708
Oh, funny story, Max.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.578
Remember that haunted treadmill
we couldn't fit in the trunk?

02:57.611 --> 02:59.647
-Yeah. -Well, when we
moved the seats up,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.081
mine got stuck like this.

03:01.114 --> 03:04.017
(laughs)
Oh, that's great.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.920
I swear, man, sometimes this job
straight up sucks.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.989
Even the LAPD
was more glamorous.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.091
We were knee-deep in perks.
You know why?

03:11.124 --> 03:14.495
'Cause we weren't
a secret organization.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.398
Okay, well... maybe it's not the
most glamorous job in the world,

03:17.431 --> 03:19.099
but we're helping people.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.768
You know, a good deed
is its own reward...

03:20.801 --> 03:22.503
Free pizza is its own reward.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.438
And I used to get it every time
I wore my cop uniform

03:24.472 --> 03:26.574
in a pizzeria, any pizzeria.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.075
Name a pizzeria.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.710
Domino's?

03:29.743 --> 03:32.613
(sighs)
Except for Domino's.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.748
CHAZ:
Tonight on Ghost Studz,

03:34.782 --> 03:36.917
we're gonna brave
the spooks and ghouls

03:36.950 --> 03:39.119
of this tweaked out abandoned
mental hospital.

03:39.152 --> 03:42.122
JARED: It's our second
and final night in the hospital

03:42.155 --> 03:45.259
that's been shut down
since the 1980s.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.027
Oh, man, I love the '80s.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.029
Remember Baby Jessica?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.864
(baby voice):
Help, I'm in a well.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.033
Aah!
(laughs)

03:53.066 --> 03:54.902
-Oh, dude, she was hot.
-Yeah.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.237
Yeah. I mean, like,
well, you know,

03:57.271 --> 03:59.239
when she became Woman Jessica,
she got hot.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.274
LEROY:
Boom.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.576
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.313
We're gonna be using
a sweet EVP recorder

04:05.346 --> 04:07.581
and a laser grid.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.550
(vocalizing)

04:09.583 --> 04:12.586
And some adult diapers,
just in case Jared gets scared

04:12.620 --> 04:16.590
-and destroys another pair
of his Lee's. -One time.

04:16.624 --> 04:20.494
All that tonight
on #Ghost Studz.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.296
Cut. Great, I think we got it.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.164
Nice work, big guy.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.833
Ponytail,
you almost blew my shot.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.302
That's strike one.

04:28.336 --> 04:32.306
Okay, out of...
three, I'm assuming?

04:32.340 --> 04:34.274
Hey, Jared.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.444
Ah, man, that was
a kicking shot before.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.911
It was an honor to boom it.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.279
Hey, anyway,
I was just wondering

04:39.313 --> 04:40.748
if I could pick your brain
about, like,

04:40.781 --> 04:43.150
crazy stuff you've seen around
here, like spooky stuff?

04:43.183 --> 04:45.018
Wait a minute, I know you.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.820
Mm... No, I-I don't think so.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.022
You didn't have
the stupid ponytail,

04:49.056 --> 04:51.191
but... Professor Jennifer?

04:51.224 --> 04:53.827
Oh. No, no, no, no.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.430
Dude, you were totally
my freaking science teacher

04:56.464 --> 04:58.632
-in college.
-Jared Soloman.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.469
-(laughing): Yeah. Yes.
-Jared Soloman.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.672
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God. Whoa.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.475
Oh, dude, this is so sad.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.110
Wow, you are, like,
a total loser now.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.179
Yeah, no, I mean,
I heard you went, like,

05:12.212 --> 05:13.881
psycho when your wife left you,

05:13.914 --> 05:15.849
but you have hit rock bottom.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.618
-This is your rock bottom,
right? -Uh, this is... no.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.820
I mean,
you're a microphone holder?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.556
I'm sorry,
I-I did not recognize you.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.392
Y-Y-You seem like, uh...

05:24.425 --> 05:27.194
-Dope. Yeah, no.
-Well... (stammers)

05:27.227 --> 05:28.629
I got rid of the glasses.
I grew my hair out.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.398
-I lost 200 pounds.
-Okay.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.633
-Oh. -That's probably why you
don't recognize me.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.802
-Sure, yeah.
-Yeah, but then I stopped

05:34.835 --> 05:36.236
with all that stupid
school stuff, and...

05:36.269 --> 05:37.871
But you were such
a gifted student.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.807
Y-You had this, like,
bright future ahead of you.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.009
-I'm on TV now, so...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.478
-No, totally, I know.
That's way better. -Yeah. Yeah.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.847
Wait, what about your socks?
You got to pay for your socks.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.082
Dude, I'm telling you,
everything I wear,

05:49.116 --> 05:52.753
-I get for free, down to my
modal boxer briefs. -Modal.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.522
It's this new fabric. It's three
times softer than cotton.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.223
-Damn, three times?
-Yeah.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.891
My drawers feel
like construction paper.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.527
-JARED: Chaz, check it out.
-What's up?

05:59.560 --> 06:02.329
This freaking dorkus was
my college teacher.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.931
Professor, but...

06:03.964 --> 06:05.566
Yeah, but then he had
a brain melt

06:05.599 --> 06:07.401
-because his wife dumped him.
-Well, she was abducted.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.236
(laughing):
Oh, my God, that's hilarious,

06:09.269 --> 06:11.071
because, like, now,
you're his boss.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.575
-Oh, man, America rules. -Whoa.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.510
-Ultra tight.
-It is tight.

06:16.544 --> 06:19.179
Hey, listen, I was just talking
to J-dog about, like,

06:19.212 --> 06:21.782
any creepy stuff that maybe
happened around here?

06:21.815 --> 06:24.752
Oh, yeah, for sure, 100%.

06:24.785 --> 06:28.055
-Um, we had some stage five
clingers. -Clingers.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.891
Yeah, they were actually right
where you guys are standing.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.726
CHAZ:
Mm-hmm.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.628
Oh, they're talking about us.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.029
Yeah. I get that.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.230
CHAZ:
Hey, they're talking about us

06:37.264 --> 06:38.932
talking about them.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.367
Yeah, I get that.
I was being him.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.570
CHAZ:
I get that.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.037
I was being you being them.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.272
Did you see homeboy's ponytail?

06:45.305 --> 06:47.374
-Oh, my God, dude.
-Ooh, ooh, ooh.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.810
-You're him.
-(both laugh)

06:49.843 --> 06:51.378
CHAZ:
Now I'm him.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.314
Come on, we got to follow
these buttfaces.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.217
Hey, have you heard
from the guys yet?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.652
No, nothing.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.153
You know, Leroy's right
about this chair.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.755
It sucks.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.657
I'm gonna tell Deirdre
I need a new chair.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.926
Deirdre? No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.728
-I would not do that.
-Why? She's an accountant.

07:07.761 --> 07:08.996
Her job is to buy us stuff.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.598
No, she is not
just an accountant.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.600
Look, I heard one time
that she caught Darren

07:12.633 --> 07:15.936
trying to take home a club soda,
she made him eat the can.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.671
We deserve perks.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.273
At my cousin's office, they have
a tropical fish tank,

07:20.307 --> 07:22.776
and on your birthday,
you get to eat one of the fish.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.645
-That's a perk?
-Yes.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.247
He chose this beautifully mature
pufferfish.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.282
That's a meal you don't forget
in a hurry.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.652
Well, if you mess with Deirdre,
she will eat you.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.354
Bon appÃ©tit, baby.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.292
Oh, Dr. Barry.
Hello there.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.360
Dee Dee, baby...

07:40.393 --> 07:43.196
Oh, it's Deirdre.
Mm-hmm.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.534
How's the old, uh, number
crunching coming, Deirdre?

07:46.567 --> 07:49.537
It's going great, actually.
Uh, I just got a new spreadsheet

07:49.570 --> 07:51.939
-program that allows... -Great.
Anyways, I'm going to need

07:51.972 --> 07:54.675
a new office chair
because my back is a-howling.

07:54.708 --> 07:58.111
And I'm thinking about
the Airback Luxury Exec Model.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.048
It's about $900,
but it's worth every penny.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.050
And I want it in black,
matte black.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.352
I just want it done,
and I want it delivered today.

08:05.385 --> 08:08.021
Well, I don't know
if I'll be able to do it today,

08:08.055 --> 08:09.456
but I will do my best.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.458
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.862
Did I, um,
make it sound like a request?

08:16.396 --> 08:19.066
Of course.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.268
I'll get you your chair
right away.

08:22.603 --> 08:23.871
Thank you.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.906
(whooping, laughing)

08:25.939 --> 08:27.875
-I'm a mental patient.
-Yeah. Now do me.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.711
No way. It's still my turn, man.
We said turns are two minutes.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.480
No, I was timing it
and it's been two minutes.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.316
-Now do me!
-Dude.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.351
(whispers): Do you think
maybe we did too many 'shrooms?

08:38.385 --> 08:41.254
-No.
-Me neither. Okay, cool.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.557
-For a second, I was like,
"Whoa..." -Dude, excuse me.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.525
Don't you roll away from me.
It's my turn.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.194
-I'm not doing anything.
-Chaz?

08:47.227 --> 08:49.062
What the hell, man?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.398
Um... Uh...

08:51.431 --> 08:53.400
Wha... Uh...

08:53.433 --> 08:54.768
Oh!

08:54.802 --> 08:56.369
That was sick.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.271
What happened?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.440
I don't know.
That was crazy.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.245
-Dude, the wheelchair's stuck.
-What?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.417
Oh, man. I think
we might be experiencing

09:10.450 --> 09:12.452
a real paranormal event.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.054
We got to investigate it.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.757
We are the Ghost Studz.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.158
-Let's do this.
-Yeah.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.629
(screaming)

09:29.002 --> 09:31.805
MAX: I am so disappointed
in Jared. I mean,

09:31.839 --> 09:34.141
he was a really good student.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.276
Now he's just such a dick.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.145
How do they know
each of these packs of almonds

09:38.178 --> 09:40.047
are exactly 100 calories?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.448
They don't know.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.582
They can't know.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.251
(screaming on headphones)

09:44.284 --> 09:45.919
Oh, my God, that's them.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.656
Sounds like they're really
in trouble.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.125
Should we help them, or...?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.794
BOTH:
Uh...

09:53.827 --> 09:57.530
(high-pitched): Uh...

09:59.299 --> 10:01.301
Let's mount up.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.072
*

10:05.105 --> 10:07.507
(powering up)

10:07.540 --> 10:10.510
I mean, honestly, I feel
like this is too much gear.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.145
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.181
*

10:16.183 --> 10:17.284
(powering up)

10:17.317 --> 10:18.786
Much more comfortable.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.353
-Oh, totally.
-Let's go.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.588
LEROY:
Did you see how many types

10:21.621 --> 10:23.590
of gum they had? Seven.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.959
-Plus, they give out Turkish
coffee at lunchtime. -Okay.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.328
Dude, you are so obsessed
with the free stuff.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.930
What's with the free stuff?

10:29.963 --> 10:32.032
It's not about free stuff.
It's about respect.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.802
When I was a mall cop,
I dreamed about having a job

10:34.835 --> 10:36.169
I could take pride in again.

10:36.203 --> 10:39.206
Yeah, and now you have it,
Leroy.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.875
But I don't get treated like it
because nobody knows what I do.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.477
I know what you do, buddy.

10:44.511 --> 10:45.979
(static)

10:46.013 --> 10:48.381
Oh, Max, Leroy,
do you hear that?

10:48.415 --> 10:50.383
-What? Where?
-Who?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.219
CHAZ:
What the hell is happening?

10:52.252 --> 10:54.221
-What the hell is that?
-It's their voices.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.389
-Where they coming from?
-JARED: Make it stop.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.791
It's the guys.

10:57.825 --> 11:01.294
CHAZ:
Whoa, that dude has no face.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.263
It's like they're here
in the hallway with us.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.235
Annie, where are we headed?

11:08.268 --> 11:11.304
Head south into the next hall,
and then go straight.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.372
Copy that.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.878
(whispering):
Max.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.381
(loud clank)

11:21.414 --> 11:23.083
The refrigerator just
took my chain.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.191
(hissing)

11:35.896 --> 11:37.731
(refrigerator humming)

11:41.034 --> 11:42.836
(gasps)

11:42.870 --> 11:45.705
Whoa. What is this thing?

11:45.739 --> 11:47.274
BARRY:
I'm not sure, but at a guess,

11:47.307 --> 11:49.176
-I'd say a portal.
-A portal?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.411
-Definitely a portal.
-A portal portal?

11:51.444 --> 11:52.412
Yes, a portal portal.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.214
Man, that's full nuts,

11:54.247 --> 11:55.883
like the phone booth
on Doctor Who.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.385
Yeah. Wait a second,

11:58.418 --> 12:00.587
-you watch Doctor Who?
-I saw one on accident.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.721
I was flipping
through the channels.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.023
Okay, now is not the time,

12:03.056 --> 12:05.959
but we are going
to talk about this.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.196
Now, look, we have
to test this out. Um...

12:09.229 --> 12:11.031
You stick your hand in there.
I'll hold on to you.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.365
-I'm not sticking my hand
in there. -Why not?

12:12.399 --> 12:13.867
I don't know what's over there.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.435
What if it's, like,
monsters or devils?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.937
-You think there's a devil in
that refrigerator? -I don't know

12:16.970 --> 12:18.205
-what's over there.
-Okay, why don't

12:18.238 --> 12:19.206
you stick your arm
in there and find out?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.207
I don't know, it might be.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.942
-You find out.
-Well... absolutely.

12:21.975 --> 12:22.943
I'll go first.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.144
-Yeah, enjoy.
-Don't care.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.578
Here we go.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.148
Not a, uh... not a big deal.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.318
(whooshes)

12:31.351 --> 12:33.120
Whoa.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.221
What's it feel like?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.124
Well... it's cold.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.458
It's a refrigerator.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.829
It's kind of... tingly.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.331
(shouts)
Oh, something touched it.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.598
-What was it?
-Uh...

12:45.632 --> 12:47.300
A devil?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.637
Smells weird.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.806
You sure that's not what
your hand always smells like?

12:52.840 --> 12:55.675
You know what, I have no idea.
That's a really good point.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.944
Do you know what your hand
smells like?

12:56.977 --> 12:59.112
-Cocoa butter.
-Right.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.613
ANNIE:
What's our plan here, guys?

13:00.647 --> 13:01.614
I mean, think about it,
you could

13:01.648 --> 13:02.916
enter a new dimension.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.951
Or your body could get
shredded up

13:03.984 --> 13:05.352
and turned into a mushy soup.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.686
Although, that means
that we will likely lose

13:06.719 --> 13:07.821
all visual and audio

13:07.855 --> 13:09.622
communication once you go in.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.491
All right, look, we are supposed
to look after the Ghost Studz,

13:11.524 --> 13:13.493
and I am willing to bet
they went in there.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.828
What do you think we should do?

13:14.862 --> 13:16.096
We could go back to our nice,

13:16.129 --> 13:17.664
-normal lives...
-Right.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.967
...or we could jump in that
strange, stupid hole

13:20.000 --> 13:22.269
and maybe get turned
into a mushy soup.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.004
I think we both know
the answer to this.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.305
Absolutely.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.144
Aw, man, you chose mushy soup?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.013
(grunts)

13:33.046 --> 13:34.714
(screaming)

13:40.220 --> 13:42.489
(screaming)

13:42.522 --> 13:45.292
(groaning)

13:45.325 --> 13:47.494
-(high-pitched ringing)
-Aah!

13:47.527 --> 13:48.661
My ears are popping.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.630
-Your ears popping?
-What?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.333
-Are your ears popping?
-No, I ate, like, an hour ago.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.468
Damn it, I left my gum.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.637
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around this, Leroy.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.306
I mean, we actually transgressed

13:59.339 --> 14:02.042
the very fabric
of space and time.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.911
We crossed
into another dimension,

14:03.944 --> 14:06.246
and it just looks like
we're on the set

14:06.279 --> 14:08.015
of a Nine Inch Nails video.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.217
It's freezing in here.
Let's find those chuckleheads

14:10.250 --> 14:12.185
-before the portal closes.
-Okay, okay.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.686
Listen, it's gonna be fine.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.222
I'm sure they're
around here somewhere.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.891
Uh... Let's go through there.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.927
(panting)

14:23.263 --> 14:24.998
Oh, yeah. This is gonna be fine.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.700
What-- it's not my fault
the other dimension is infinite.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.102
Come on, let's find them.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.503
Are you cold?

14:30.537 --> 14:31.939
-Yes.
-I am so cold.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.707
Chet?

14:34.741 --> 14:36.409
Chaz? Chet... What is it?

14:36.443 --> 14:38.178
-Is it Chet?
-It's Chaz.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.380
-Chaz!
-I don't know.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.115
Come on, man,
we got to get out of here.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.384
I don't want to get stuck
in this dimension.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.053
MAX:
Bed with blood.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.254
Lamp.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.356
Visqueen.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.358
Upturned bed.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.060
My ears still haven't popped
all the way.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.195
More Visqueen. Wheelchair.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.230
Are you playing a game
I'm not aware of?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.232
If so, I need the rules
and the basic system of scoring.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.633
And I'll dunk all over your ass.

15:00.667 --> 15:01.969
No. I'm taking
a mental inventory

15:02.002 --> 15:03.403
of everything we see
on our route,

15:03.436 --> 15:04.737
so we can find our way back.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.439
-Oh, that's smart.
-CHAZ: Yo!

15:06.473 --> 15:08.541
Is that you, crew dudes?

15:08.575 --> 15:09.742
Go. Go.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.213
Weird dresser with weird head.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.414
Okay.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.716
CHAZ:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.885
Are you guys, like,
following us?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.887
(laughs) They're, like,
obsessed with us.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.122
Yeah, dude,
you guys are total groupies.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.456
No, we got to get
the hell out of here.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.092
Yeah, that portal
is gonna close up.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.659
JARED:
No. No, no, no, no, no.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.095
I am so cold.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.562
Yeah, I got, like,
full body chills.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.764
This is a killer, killer trip.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.400
Yeah, you've got
a full body chill

15:33.433 --> 15:35.602
because you are freezing
to death.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.337
-Huh?
-Okay, maybe that, but, like,

15:37.370 --> 15:38.805
wouldn't it be cool if, like,
some chicks popped up

15:38.838 --> 15:40.307
or something like that, or...

15:40.340 --> 15:41.441
I don't know,
I guess we'll just chill

15:41.474 --> 15:42.509
with these guys in the meantime.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.676
What guys?

15:43.710 --> 15:46.579
(distorted growling)

15:46.613 --> 15:49.482
BOTH: Aah! Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

15:49.516 --> 15:51.684
Come on, guys, get up, get up!

15:51.718 --> 15:53.853
LaFREY:
Where are my Nespresso pods?

15:55.322 --> 15:56.823
My Nespresso pods are gone.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.825
And there is a note
on Deirdre's stationery

15:58.858 --> 16:00.994
saying that we are no longer
allowed in the main kitchen.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.996
Well, maybe it's good
that you cut back on caffeine,

16:03.030 --> 16:05.632
'cause I notice that you startle
easy in the afternoons.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.800
-Your Donettes are gone, too.
-I will cut someone.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.203
Well, that's just the lack
of Donettes talking, isn't it?

16:10.237 --> 16:13.340
Hey, we're out of staples
and-and toilet paper, too.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.375
Yeah, and didn't there
used to be a lamp here?

16:15.408 --> 16:16.509
There was a lamp there.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.677
Hi, everybody.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.179
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.481
Uh, I wanted to let you know
that in order to afford

16:21.514 --> 16:22.782
Barry's matte black chair,

16:22.815 --> 16:24.451
which is very expensive,

16:24.484 --> 16:27.820
I had to get creative
with the budget in other areas.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.458
The most important thing
is that Barry be comfortable.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.060
Right?

16:38.031 --> 16:39.999
Thank you for understanding,
everyone.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.568
Very... very kind of you.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.336
MAX: Okay, follow me.
I know the way back.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.572
It's gurney on the right,
tub on the left,

16:45.605 --> 16:47.840
-then counter on the right...
-No, no, no, no.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.610
It's sink on the right,
gurney on the left.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.689
Okay, and now we're lost.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.057
-(quietly): What?
-I don't know.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.358
-Where's Jared?
-Huh?

17:05.392 --> 17:06.559
Where'd he go?

17:06.593 --> 17:07.694
-What?
-What?

17:07.727 --> 17:09.096
Oh, no. Oh, no.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.330
CHAZ:
No!

17:10.363 --> 17:12.832
-Jared!
-I'm so cold! I can't move!

17:12.865 --> 17:14.934
(yells)
I'm just gonna die here.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.170
No, no, just let me die!
Let me die!

17:17.204 --> 17:19.739
-Oh! Oh! -Get up, bro.
-Relax, relax, relax, relax.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.074
We need warmth. H-Here, here.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.275
Bring it in, four-man hug.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.510
-Come on.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.877
Oh, oh, man.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.179
-(moaning)
-That's better.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.214
Oh, my God, thank you.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.749
You guys are, like,
really soft and smooth.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.850
MAX: I think you're just
on mushrooms.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.685
Portals, what do we know
about portals?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.287
Okay, guys, we have to think,
we have to think.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.889
Jared, you were one of my best
students, help us out here.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.191
What do we know about portals?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.193
Yeah, heck yeah.
Number one student,

17:40.227 --> 17:43.663
and... uh, portals...

17:45.064 --> 17:46.799
Dude, I cheated in your class.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.201
-LEROY: Jared!
-Okay, yeah. I did.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.802
I bought all my papers online,

17:49.836 --> 17:52.372
and then I had this nerd just do
all my tests for me.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.909
I-I'm actually really...
like, really stupid.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.279
All right, well, bummer.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.115
-Mm. -Uh, let's see, they're
something like a black hole.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.416
A black hole is magnetic.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.386
Whoa, black holes are magnetic.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.122
Guys, guys. I need
a little piece of metal.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.057
-A small piece of metal.
Anything. -Okay, yeah. -Yeah.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.160
-Right here, come on.
-Uh...

18:13.193 --> 18:15.962
-Here, here!
-Yes, yes. Perfect, Leroy.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.930
All right, gentlemen,
what we are going to do

18:17.964 --> 18:20.800
is we are going
to make a compass.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.302
Due north won't help us, Max.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.970
Very good, Leroy.
Due north

18:24.003 --> 18:26.306
will not help us, but if I put

18:26.339 --> 18:29.108
a little charge in this puppy,
what are we gonna do?

18:29.142 --> 18:31.010
We're gonna grab that rubbing
alcohol right there.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.111
Dude, I'm so bored.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.415
Then, we grab
just a dime store cork.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.250
-Put that in there.
-JARED: Sick.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.085
-I don't know what's happening.
-Me neither.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.087
And with the charge
as strong as the portal,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.755
this should point us
in the right direction.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.524
Okay, good.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.327
-It's headed that way.
-Yes, yes.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.328
Let's go. Let's go!

18:48.361 --> 18:49.996
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

18:50.029 --> 18:51.164
LEROY:
This way, this way!

18:51.198 --> 18:52.332
So much plastic.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.000
-Uh, go!
-Hurry up!

18:54.033 --> 18:55.168
There! Here it is. Come on.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.469
Oh, thank God.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.472
It's frozen over?

18:59.506 --> 19:00.840
Grab something. Hack away at it.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.975
-I'm not dying here.
-Okay. Come on.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.378
(grunting)

19:05.412 --> 19:07.680
-LEROY: Keep digging.
-(grunting)

19:08.881 --> 19:10.517
MAX:
Hit it harder!

19:10.550 --> 19:11.518
(screeching)

19:11.551 --> 19:12.519
LEROY:
It's breaking!

19:12.552 --> 19:15.322
Oh! Go, go, go, go!

19:15.355 --> 19:16.989
-It's open!
-Jared, go!

19:17.023 --> 19:19.326
I'm going first.
(shouts)

19:19.359 --> 19:20.627
MAX:
Chaz, get in there. Go!

19:20.660 --> 19:22.462
-Max, you go. I got him.
-Okay.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.797
See you on the other side.
(shouts)

19:24.831 --> 19:25.998
Chaz, what are you doing? Go!

19:26.032 --> 19:27.834
Just a second. I got to get
a selfie with this guy.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.736
-He's got, like, no face.
-We got to go!

19:29.769 --> 19:32.672
Guys, wait. Wait, help me! Aah!

19:32.705 --> 19:35.074
I'm dying here, please!
Save me, I'm dying!

19:35.107 --> 19:36.843
-(shouting)
-Help me, I don't want to die!

19:36.876 --> 19:39.011
Oh! I thought you were gonna
punch me, you punched him.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.713
-Thank you.
-Get in there, ding-dong.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.417
Good-bye, other dimension.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.556
(shouting)

19:49.589 --> 19:51.591
(grunting)

19:51.624 --> 19:54.193
-(panting) -Come on, come on.
-CHAZ: Oh, my God.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.195
Whoa, what a comedown.
(laughs)

19:56.229 --> 19:58.598
Hey, man,
thanks for being my Eskimo.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.999
JARED:
Yeah, dude.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.168
And coming up
with that cool compass idea?

20:02.201 --> 20:04.070
Oh, well, the compass idea
was actually mine, but...

20:04.103 --> 20:07.073
You, and you alone,
saved our lives.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.908
How can we repay you?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.244
Ah, man, I don't need payment
for doing the right thing.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.012
I'm just glad
you boys are all right.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.281
JARED:
Wow.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.549
-True hero.
-(grunts)

20:16.583 --> 20:18.751
You know what? How about
a couple of those jackets

20:18.785 --> 20:20.487
with the name
of the show on 'em?

20:22.121 --> 20:25.091
Wow. You really are a fanboy.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.459
Yeah, we'll get you
some jackets.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.794
-If it's not a big deal.
-KIRSTEN: Hey!

20:27.827 --> 20:30.530
Where were you guys?

20:30.563 --> 20:33.633
Uh, we were in another
dimension, and it was awesome.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.302
They ate mushrooms again,
didn't they?

20:35.335 --> 20:37.069
-Yes, they did.
-Yeah, okay, look.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.472
Everyone back to work. We still
have an episode to deliver.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.442
No, Ms. Producer Lady, we quit.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.312
We're going back to our actual
jobs that have actual meaning.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.213
Oh, also, you should
probably know

20:47.246 --> 20:49.316
that this ponytail is fake.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.318
Okay? So joke's on you.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.619
And you and you.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.954
My man had a phonytail.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.325
That's when ish got cray.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.960
We looked behind us
and the portal was shrinking.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.295
CHAZ: And even though
the portal was closing,

21:02.329 --> 21:04.764
we knew we couldn't leave
our crew behind.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.266
Our camera operator, Larry,
and our sound guy, Matt,

21:07.300 --> 21:10.269
went in with us, and we had to
make sure they got out with us.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.471
And I'm proud to say

21:11.504 --> 21:13.773
that they're here safely
with us today.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.476
-Ghost Studz.
-Ghost Studz.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.710
(coughing)

21:19.312 --> 21:20.480
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.415
Y-Your guy looks
like a male model.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.418
My guy looks
like he breeds pigeons.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.819
(laughs) I mean, yeah,
you look different,

21:26.853 --> 21:28.955
but they totally nailed
your vibe.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.089
My vibe?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.358
He couldn't stop coughing.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.660
How's your new chair, Dr. Barry?

21:33.693 --> 21:34.661
(grunts)

21:34.694 --> 21:36.028
Hi. Really, really great.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.764
Yeah, so great.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.199
#Best chair ever.
Really comfortable, and...
