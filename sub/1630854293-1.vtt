you guys met in Somalia,

08:47.196 --> 08:48.800

but better.

08:52.806 --> 08:55.906
No, we were on a mission and,
uh, my sergeant had promised us

08:55.941 --> 08:57.611
a beer as a reward
when we got back.

08:57.646 --> 08:59.679
But when
we returned to base,

08:59.714 --> 09:01.681
there was no beer
to be found anywhere.

09:01.716 --> 09:04.277
I don't know why,
let's just blame the SEALs.

09:04.312 --> 09:06.048
Okay, take it easy.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.347
And then I volunteered
to go out and find some.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.887
Mm-hmm, and your boy done good.

09:09.922 --> 09:12.923
He delivered enough beer
that we were drunk as skunks

09:12.958 --> 09:15.794
by the time we had to roll out
and head home the next morning.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.060

big deal, really.

09:26.070 --> 09:27.267

a word of it.

12:02.325 --> 12:04.127
Yeah.

12:04.162 --> 12:06.030
Border's over
a thousand miles long.

12:06.065 --> 12:08.197
Drugs get smuggled in
from Myanmar.

12:08.232 --> 12:09.495
They're packaged here,
and then they're

12:09.530 --> 12:11.233
shipped out
across the world.

12:11.268 --> 12:14.005
We do our best,
but it's like Whac-A-Mole.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.270
You take out one smuggler,

12:15.305 --> 12:16.876
another one pops up
in his place.

12:16.911 --> 12:19.109
Sometimes I wonder
what the point is.

12:19.144 --> 12:22.178
At least with Whac-A-Mole you
get a stuffed toy when you win.

12:22.213 --> 12:24.081
(laughs)
I hear you, man.

12:24.116 --> 12:26.314
Sometimes I feel
the exact same way,

12:26.349 --> 12:28.382
especially these
last few years.

12:28.417 --> 12:31.858
Too many people thinking
you're the bad guys.
Mm-hmm.

12:31.893 --> 12:33.585
HONDO: You know,
about a year ago,

12:33.620 --> 12:36.291
I seriously thought
about quitting.

12:36.326 --> 12:37.292
Yeah?
Yeah.

12:37.327 --> 12:38.997
What changed your mind?

12:39.032 --> 12:41.197
Well, there're people out
there who need us, Joe.

12:41.232 --> 12:43.595
And if we're not there
for them, who is?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.498
Yeah.

12:45.533 --> 12:47.940
So what about
you and Nichelle?

12:47.975 --> 12:51.339
(laughs) You're punching
above your weight there, mate.

12:51.374 --> 12:53.506
You should put a ring on it
before she figures it out.

12:53.541 --> 12:56.377
(laughs) Well,
we talked about it, we did.

12:56.412 --> 12:58.544
But, you know, neither one
of us really felt the need.

12:58.579 --> 13:01.888
The baby's the
bigger commitment.
Yeah.

13:01.923 --> 13:03.857
And if I'm
being honest...

13:04.893 --> 13:07.157
...never really held that
much stock in marriage.

13:07.192 --> 13:09.929
Didn't stop my pops
from walking away.

13:09.964 --> 13:12.228
Sins of the father, eh?
(chuckles) Yeah.

13:12.263 --> 13:15.066
I know I am nothing like him.
I will never walk out.

13:15.101 --> 13:17.002
But I ain't gonna lie,
sometimes I worry

13:17.037 --> 13:19.004
that something might happen
to me on this job and...

13:19.039 --> 13:21.941
my kid'll still feel the
same way I did about my pops.

13:21.976 --> 13:24.042
That I abandoned them.

13:24.077 --> 13:25.538
You know as well as I do...
(sighs)

13:25.573 --> 13:27.507
...there's no guarantees
with this job.

13:27.542 --> 13:30.884
We got to just make good
memories while we can.

13:30.919 --> 13:32.919
That's a pretty good piece
of advice, my friend.

13:32.954 --> 13:34.954
(laughs)
It's what I'm here for.

13:35.790 --> 13:38.518
HONDO: So, tell me about this
drug kingpin you took down.

13:38.553 --> 13:41.290
Zaw Min, aka the Ghost Man.

13:41.325 --> 13:44.425
He styled himself
as a Burmese Pablo Escobar.

13:44.460 --> 13:47.263
Abducted kids
from the local villages,

13:47.298 --> 13:49.232
used them as slave labor
in his factories.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.036
I'll tell you,
closing him down,

13:51.071 --> 13:53.137
that felt
like a real win.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.601
So, then, I guess there are
prizes after all, huh?

13:59.343 --> 14:02.179
Hey, just talked to
Detective Rios from GND.

14:02.214 --> 14:04.247
He said to say thanks
for forwarding that file

14:04.282 --> 14:05.677
from Hondo on the
Green Tea heroin.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.316
Yeah, let's hope
he can put it to use.

14:07.351 --> 14:08.548
Well, he's following
up a few leads,

14:08.583 --> 14:10.121
but get this, he told me

14:10.156 --> 14:12.024
they brought in a street
dealer this week, small fry.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.685
But the guy told them
he's getting deliveries

14:13.720 --> 14:15.555
of that Green Tea
heroin weekly.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.227
And more shipments
were promised.

14:17.262 --> 14:19.064
What are you saying?

14:22.135 --> 14:24.003
(man shouts in Burmese)

14:24.038 --> 14:25.334
Hold up.

14:25.369 --> 14:27.204
Movement. Get down.

14:27.239 --> 14:29.239
(men talking loudly)

14:30.605 --> 14:32.539
(indistinct chatter)

14:39.548 --> 14:41.614
I thought you shut
this place down.

14:41.649 --> 14:43.121
We did.

14:43.156 --> 14:44.386
We razed it half to the ground.

14:44.421 --> 14:46.091
Pulled bodies from the ashes.

14:46.126 --> 14:47.719
But they're back
in action.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.391
That's a ballsy move.

14:49.426 --> 14:51.360
Starting it up again
on the same site.

14:51.395 --> 14:53.131
They must've thought
lightning wouldn't strike

14:53.166 --> 14:54.693
twice in the same place.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.465
And it wouldn't have, if you
hadn't wanted to see it.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.435
Son of a bitch,
it can't be.

15:00.470 --> 15:01.667
HONCHO: What?
Is that Zaw Min?

15:01.702 --> 15:03.570
You said he was dead.
I thought he was.

15:03.605 --> 15:05.572
He was inside when
the place imploded.

15:05.607 --> 15:07.442
His body was burned
beyond recognition.

15:07.477 --> 15:09.213
We had to ID him
from his tattoos.

15:09.248 --> 15:10.577
Must've screwed up.

15:10.612 --> 15:12.183
Well, he's alive.

15:12.218 --> 15:14.647
And he's got a whole
new workforce, too.

15:14.682 --> 15:17.716
(sighs) Okay. We
need to fall back.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.993
I got to call this in.

15:21.392 --> 15:23.458
(man screams)
(gunfire)

15:23.493 --> 15:25.592
(speaking Burmese)

15:31.204 --> 15:32.698
Fall back! Fall back!

15:39.410 --> 15:41.410
(shouts)

15:43.480 --> 15:45.183
(speaking Burmese)

15:59.595 --> 16:01.628
Come on!
To the rope bridge!

16:17.712 --> 16:19.085
Hey!

16:21.386 --> 16:22.781
It's no good.
We got to turn back.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.783
Only one way off this bridge.

16:44.112 --> 16:45.672
Hondo, it's me. Call me back.

16:45.707 --> 16:49.544
I got some news
on that heroin factory.

16:49.579 --> 16:52.514
Trying to get through to Hondo,
but his phone's switched off.

16:52.549 --> 16:55.121
Hey, my phone would be off,
too, if I was with my woman,

16:55.156 --> 16:57.255
enjoying some
well-earned vacation time.

16:57.290 --> 16:59.587
Yeah. Well, let's just
hope that's all it is.

17:06.563 --> 17:08.563
Radio's bust.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.075
Phone, too.

17:17.409 --> 17:19.409
I'm out.

17:21.809 --> 17:23.314
I got one round left.

17:24.350 --> 17:26.152
You got any other weapons?

17:26.187 --> 17:27.780
Just my knife.

17:29.190 --> 17:31.322
You got any idea
where we are?

17:31.357 --> 17:33.786
Yeah, we're close to the border.

17:33.821 --> 17:36.261
This whole area's
Zaw Min's territory.

17:36.296 --> 17:38.626
Nearest safe spot is
20 klicks south.

17:39.761 --> 17:41.497
Let's get moving.

17:41.532 --> 17:43.532
(grunting)

17:45.239 --> 17:47.602
What's up?
Little problem.

17:49.210 --> 17:51.441
I've been shot.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.316
NICHELLE:
<i> I wonder how the boys</i>
<i> are doing.</i>

17:58.351 --> 18:00.285
MAY:
<i> I bet they're having fun.</i>

18:00.320 --> 18:02.749
I can't imagine
how trekking through the jungle

18:02.784 --> 18:06.192
in this heat counts as fun,
but to each their own.

18:06.227 --> 18:07.622
(laughs)

18:07.657 --> 18:09.855
You must worry
about Joe.

18:09.890 --> 18:12.561
Seems like a dangerous job
he's doing.

18:12.596 --> 18:15.300
Hondo's job's
not so different.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.899
Buddhism teaches us
not to dwell on worries.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.902
Because worrying
won't change the outcome?

18:25.444 --> 18:27.444
But it's hard...

18:28.645 --> 18:31.250
...when you love
someone whose life

18:31.285 --> 18:33.285
is always in danger.

18:34.354 --> 18:36.288
Sit down, right here, sit.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.257
(grunts)

18:38.292 --> 18:39.621
Let me take a look.

18:39.656 --> 18:40.754
(grunts)

18:40.789 --> 18:42.195
Oh, God.

18:42.230 --> 18:44.263
Bullet's still inside.

18:44.298 --> 18:46.562
I'm still breathing, so it
can't have hit anything major.

18:46.597 --> 18:48.663
I still got the use of my legs,
let's get going.

18:48.698 --> 18:50.269
No, no, no.
Take it easy, take it easy.

18:50.304 --> 18:51.765
You've lost a lot of blood, Joe.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.866
I've still got a few pints left.
I'm good.

18:53.901 --> 18:56.869
(groans) Or, or...

18:56.904 --> 18:58.904
I could just stay here
and put my feet up,

18:58.939 --> 19:00.444
and you go fetch help.

19:00.479 --> 19:02.908
No man left behind.
Marine motto.

19:02.943 --> 19:04.976
I won't tell if you don't.
(both laugh)

19:05.011 --> 19:07.253
(engines approaching)

19:08.850 --> 19:10.751
We got to hide, come on.

19:10.786 --> 19:13.754
Grab me, grab me.
Over there, over there.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.972
(groans)
Get down.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.545
(grunts)

19:35.580 --> 19:36.975
(men speaking Burmese)

19:42.587 --> 19:45.555
Hey. You thinking
what I'm thinking?

19:45.590 --> 19:47.953
If you're thinking about
stealing that Jeep and getting

19:47.988 --> 19:49.328
the hell out of here, yeah.

19:49.363 --> 19:50.791
Can you make it
that far?

19:50.826 --> 19:51.924
Yeah.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.959
Come on.
(groans)

19:53.994 --> 19:56.269
(grunts)
Come on.

19:57.899 --> 19:59.635
SOMCHAI:
Hey, how did you guys
like the Thai Green Curry?

19:59.670 --> 20:01.802
DEACON: It's good. Might
be the best I've ever had.

20:01.837 --> 20:03.441
I told them to make yours
extra spicy, Tan.

20:03.476 --> 20:05.311
Can you handle it?

20:05.346 --> 20:07.676
You should try my mom's Dan Dan
noodles, then we'll talk hot.

20:07.711 --> 20:10.382
This is nothing, it's like
drinking milk. (exhales)

20:10.417 --> 20:13.484
Is it true there are female
SWAT officer in America?

20:13.519 --> 20:15.981
Yeah. Our friend Chris,
she was one of the first.

20:16.016 --> 20:18.621
She paved the way for others.

20:18.656 --> 20:20.557
Now we've got a few.

20:20.592 --> 20:22.427
A few more than here.

20:22.462 --> 20:24.792
Does your daughter want
to become a SWAT officer?

20:24.827 --> 20:28.026
Let's see, last time I checked,
she wanted to be president.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.632
Oh, she aims high.

20:29.667 --> 20:31.997
I just tell her
if she works hard,

20:32.032 --> 20:33.999
she can be whatever
she wants to be.

20:34.034 --> 20:36.573
What about you?

20:36.608 --> 20:38.608
What did you want to be
when you were younger?

20:38.643 --> 20:41.039
I used to read a lot
of Sherlock Holmes.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.844
I loved those books, and
that's how I learned English.

20:43.879 --> 20:46.011
Also, watching
American movies.

20:46.046 --> 20:48.013
So you wanted to be
a detective, huh?
Yes.

20:48.048 --> 20:49.916
But that was
just a dream.

20:49.951 --> 20:51.456
Why?

20:51.491 --> 20:52.952
It's difficult here
as a woman.

20:53.888 --> 20:56.362
Maybe I would have made it,
but I never had a father

20:56.397 --> 20:58.859
like you to encourage me
and now, it's too late.

21:01.996 --> 21:03.996
♪ ♪

21:07.375 --> 21:08.968
Do you know
how to hot-wire?

21:09.003 --> 21:11.476
Yeah, but no time.
Bogey headed our way.

21:11.511 --> 21:12.906
Down, get down.

21:14.712 --> 21:16.712
(speaking Burmese)

21:54.983 --> 21:57.016
Quite a change
from burgers on the grill

21:57.051 --> 21:59.854
in Luca's backyard, huh?
(exhaling)

21:59.889 --> 22:02.054
Hey, you guys hang out
a lot as a team?

22:02.089 --> 22:04.056
Uh, yeah, we used
to a lot more.

22:04.091 --> 22:05.794
The last year we've all
gotten a little busy.

22:05.829 --> 22:07.400
What about here?

22:07.435 --> 22:08.962
Does Thai SWAT hang out
off duty?

22:08.997 --> 22:10.667
SOMCHAI:
Not really. We have work.

22:10.702 --> 22:14.000
And then we have family.
We don't mix the two.

22:14.035 --> 22:15.837
We do. LAPD SWAT is family.

22:15.872 --> 22:17.641
Hello?

22:17.676 --> 22:20.710
HONDO: Deacon! Do you copy?
Hondo, what's going on?

22:20.745 --> 22:22.041
We need help.

22:22.076 --> 22:24.010
Joe... (static)
We need immediate evac.

22:24.045 --> 22:25.880
We're, we're near the border...

22:25.915 --> 22:27.750
Zaw Min's heroin...

22:27.785 --> 22:29.455
(crackles) ...by a river.

22:29.490 --> 22:32.051
Hey, Hondo, say that again.
I'm not copying.

22:32.086 --> 22:34.592
(garbled transmission)
Hondo?!

22:34.627 --> 22:35.857
TAN: What's
going on?

22:35.892 --> 22:37.628
I'm not sure, he's definitely
in trouble, though.

22:37.663 --> 22:39.762
He said something
about needing an evac.

22:39.797 --> 22:41.995
(sighs) His cell's going
straight to voice mail.

22:42.030 --> 22:44.602
All right, keep trying.
I'll call Nichelle.

22:44.637 --> 22:47.473
Oh, come on.
Battery's dead.

22:47.508 --> 22:50.003
We got to move, Joe.
We got to move, man.
Yeah.

22:50.038 --> 22:51.873
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, hey!

22:51.908 --> 22:53.809
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, no trouble.

22:53.844 --> 22:54.909
We're friendly.

22:54.944 --> 22:56.878
Friendly.

22:56.913 --> 22:58.583
We don't want any trouble.

22:59.817 --> 23:02.081
You like the Lakers?

23:02.116 --> 23:04.457
Your shirt,
the Lakers.

23:04.492 --> 23:05.953
You like them?

23:05.988 --> 23:07.592
You American?

23:07.627 --> 23:10.595
Yeah, I'm American.
I'm from Los Angeles.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.960
Just like the Lakers.

23:18.033 --> 23:21.001
(speaking Burmese)

23:25.645 --> 23:26.776
What's he saying?

23:26.811 --> 23:28.041
JOE: His younger
brother and his friends,

23:28.076 --> 23:29.845
they're being held prisoner.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.650
They beat them, they kill
anyone that tries to escape.

23:32.685 --> 23:34.949
He wants us to save them.

23:36.590 --> 23:38.150
Listen to me,

23:38.185 --> 23:40.185
I promise we will help you.

23:40.220 --> 23:42.528
But right now,
I need you to help us.

23:43.663 --> 23:45.861
Can you get us keys

23:45.896 --> 23:48.501
for one of those Jeeps?
Keys?

23:49.933 --> 23:51.933
HONDO:
Please.

23:53.134 --> 23:54.771
TAN: I will
keep you posted.

23:54.806 --> 23:57.136
Nichelle says Hondo went
with Joe to the site of some

23:57.171 --> 23:58.577
big drug bust, but they
should've been back by now.

23:58.612 --> 24:00.238
Anyone out looking for them?
No.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.778
Rest of Joe's unit is on patrol
in the Golden Triangle,

24:01.813 --> 24:02.944
out of range. They're
not back till tomorrow.

24:02.979 --> 24:04.583
DEACON: So the two
of them are out there

24:04.618 --> 24:06.651
on their own.
We got to go help them.
TAN: How?

24:06.686 --> 24:08.686
We're hundreds of miles away.
We'd need a chopper.

24:08.721 --> 24:11.183
Lucky for you,
you know the right people.

24:20.964 --> 24:23.536
JOE: He's gonna tell
them we're here.

24:23.571 --> 24:24.966
No, he's not.

24:25.001 --> 24:27.771
The kid needs us just
as much as we need him.

24:29.709 --> 24:32.237
(speaking Burmese)

24:37.112 --> 24:39.915
(speaking Burmese)

24:42.117 --> 24:44.084
See?

24:44.119 --> 24:45.217
We can trust him.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.598
(Joe grunting)

24:54.998 --> 24:57.262
You good?
(groans) Yeah. Uh-huh.

24:57.297 --> 24:59.836
Hey. Thank you.

24:59.871 --> 25:02.003
Thank you.

25:02.038 --> 25:03.939
My name's Hondo. What's yours?

25:03.974 --> 25:05.105
Thet.

25:05.140 --> 25:07.173
Thet. Come with us, Thet.

25:07.208 --> 25:09.010
We can get you someplace safe.

25:09.045 --> 25:10.682
No, I can't leave.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.717
Not without my brother
and the others.

25:14.853 --> 25:17.051
Okay, I understand.

25:17.086 --> 25:19.152
We will come back for you,
I promise.

25:19.187 --> 25:21.088
No, you won't.

25:21.123 --> 25:22.859
But that's okay.

25:25.765 --> 25:27.325
I want to give you something.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.163
You see this?

25:30.198 --> 25:31.703
It's called
a challenge coin.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.870
Giving it to somebody is
a big, big deal.

25:33.905 --> 25:36.609
It means that that person
did something really brave.

25:36.644 --> 25:39.370
Thet, you helping us
was brave.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.812
And me giving this to you,

25:41.847 --> 25:44.716
means that we're friends.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.949
You understand?

25:46.984 --> 25:50.183
Friends.
Thet, you can trust me.

25:52.187 --> 25:54.726
Joe, let's get to the Jeep.

25:54.761 --> 25:56.761
(groans)

26:02.230 --> 26:03.900
(heavy breathing, grunting)

26:21.986 --> 26:23.986
(speaking Burmese)

26:34.064 --> 26:35.998
How are you doing?

26:36.033 --> 26:38.033
(sighs)
Not good.

26:39.872 --> 26:41.938
I hate this.

26:41.973 --> 26:44.171
Not knowing what's happening,
if they're even...

26:44.206 --> 26:46.338
alive or dead.

26:47.946 --> 26:50.012
(sighs)

26:50.047 --> 26:52.014
All we can do

26:52.049 --> 26:54.247
is stay strong

26:54.282 --> 26:56.447
and have faith.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.054
Yeah.

27:06.162 --> 27:08.998
This has been
blessed by monks.

27:09.033 --> 27:12.672
It brings luck
to whoever wears it.

27:14.907 --> 27:16.808
(sighs)

27:16.843 --> 27:18.403
Thank you.

27:21.276 --> 27:23.276
(exhales)

27:25.885 --> 27:28.314
Hondo and Joe are AWOL
somewhere in this region.

27:28.349 --> 27:30.283
Now, Deacon and Tan are
choppering north

27:30.318 --> 27:31.988
with the Thai SWAT team
to try to locate them.

27:32.023 --> 27:33.726
Okay, what can we do?
We got to do something.

27:33.761 --> 27:35.860
There's not a lot
we can do from here.
Well, maybe there is.

27:35.895 --> 27:38.126
Hondo was visiting the site
of the Green Tea heroin factory.

27:38.161 --> 27:39.424
Now, from intel on this end,

27:39.459 --> 27:41.129
sounds like
it's back up and running.

27:41.164 --> 27:43.802
Now, Deacon didn't get much on
the call, but he did get a name.

27:43.837 --> 27:46.134
Zaw Min.
He's a Burmese drug lord

27:46.169 --> 27:48.136
running the operation,
He's thought to be dead.

27:48.171 --> 27:49.841
But if his factory is
up and running...

27:49.876 --> 27:52.107
Exactly. Maybe Zaw Min is, too.

27:52.142 --> 27:53.812
Okay, the local dealer
that Rios busted,

27:53.847 --> 27:55.781
he seemed to know something
about the Green Tea operation.

27:55.816 --> 27:57.211
Maybe enough
to help us find Hondo.

27:57.246 --> 27:58.883
It's a really long shot.

27:58.918 --> 28:00.412
Well, right now,
it's our only shot.

28:00.447 --> 28:01.787
Okay, let's go. Come on.

28:01.822 --> 28:03.283
I'm so glad you guys came.

28:03.318 --> 28:04.757
I just don't know
what to think.

28:04.792 --> 28:06.121
He's gonna be okay.
We're here now.

28:06.156 --> 28:07.452
Thai SWAT's gonna lead
the search and rescue.

28:07.487 --> 28:09.157
They want to find Hondo
and Joe as much as we do.

28:09.192 --> 28:10.422
Have you had
any contact with them?

28:10.457 --> 28:11.623
No. We haven't heard anything.

28:11.658 --> 28:14.294
When I spoke to Hondo, he
mentioned something about ruins.

28:14.329 --> 28:16.065
Does that mean
anything to you?
There are old temple ruins.

28:16.100 --> 28:17.528
Close to the border
with Myanmar.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.233
We'll start there.
Please.

28:19.268 --> 28:20.399
I need you to find them.

28:20.434 --> 28:22.203
I know, but Nichelle,

28:22.238 --> 28:23.974
Tan and I don't have
jurisdiction here.

28:24.009 --> 28:25.107
You do now.

28:25.142 --> 28:26.372
I'm deputizing you two.

28:26.407 --> 28:28.143
You're now members
of the Thai SWAT team.

28:28.178 --> 28:30.409
What is it that you say?
Let's roll.

28:34.888 --> 28:36.316
HICKS:
Where'd you get the heroin from?

28:36.351 --> 28:40.056
(laughs) Come on, man,
you know I can't tell you that.

28:40.091 --> 28:42.795
You told Detective Rios
more shipments were coming.

28:42.830 --> 28:45.292
We need the name
of your connection now.

28:45.327 --> 28:48.130
You're looking at five years
for possession with intent.

28:48.165 --> 28:50.803
How's that gonna go,
you think, if word gets out

28:50.838 --> 28:52.838
you're a snitch?

28:52.873 --> 28:54.235
Wait, what snitch?

28:54.270 --> 28:56.105
I haven't told you guys
anything.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.307
Yo, you can't do that.
You can't lie.

29:00.342 --> 29:01.814
That'd be
a death sentence.

29:01.849 --> 29:03.079
We're trying
to save the life

29:03.114 --> 29:04.916
of a friend we care
a whole lot about.

29:04.951 --> 29:08.348
So what happens to you
isn't really our concern.

29:08.383 --> 29:10.988
Now you give us a name.

29:11.023 --> 29:13.386
Give us a name!

29:18.360 --> 29:19.964
Lek.
STREET: Lek?

29:19.999 --> 29:22.197
It might be a nickname.
I don't know.

29:22.232 --> 29:24.364
Oh, come on, that's not enough.
What else you got?

29:24.399 --> 29:26.300
He's Asian.

29:26.335 --> 29:28.038
All right?
Scar on his face.

29:28.073 --> 29:31.041
Told me it was from a machete
when he was a child soldier.

29:31.076 --> 29:32.537
First I thought,
"Yeah, sure,

29:32.572 --> 29:34.209
like you didn't grow up
in Alhambra."

29:34.244 --> 29:36.145
But then he starts telling me
about this man

29:36.180 --> 29:38.950
who took him off the streets,
put him to work

29:38.985 --> 29:40.578
in a heroin factory
in the jungle.

29:40.613 --> 29:42.547
That's got to be Zaw Min.

29:42.582 --> 29:44.582
Yeah. Where do we
find this guy Lek?
I don't know.

29:44.617 --> 29:47.189
What time is it?

29:47.224 --> 29:50.060
Why, you got somewhere else
to be besides prison?
No.

29:50.095 --> 29:53.426
Lek. He always gripes
about the food in L.A.

29:53.461 --> 29:56.902
Said the only place
he eats is one restaurant.

29:56.937 --> 29:58.937
I don't know,
I can't remember the name.

29:58.972 --> 30:00.235
Begins with an M.

30:00.270 --> 30:02.974
Something about it
being a taste of home.

30:03.009 --> 30:04.470
That's probably
a Burmese restaurant.

30:04.505 --> 30:06.538
All right, get on it.

30:11.545 --> 30:13.215
JOE:
It's not safe, mate.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.250
Zaw Min's got eyes everywhere.

30:15.285 --> 30:16.614
We should keep going.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.451
Well, tell that to the Jeep.
It's in worse shape

30:18.486 --> 30:20.321
than you are, Joe.
You need a doctor.

30:21.357 --> 30:23.027
Aw, great.

30:23.062 --> 30:25.326
That is what you call
Sod's law.

30:26.095 --> 30:29.198
Sir, sir! Can I borrow
your phone? Telephone?

30:29.233 --> 30:31.530
They're not gonna help.
They're too scared.

30:31.565 --> 30:34.269
Zaw Min finds out,
they're dead in a ditch.

30:34.304 --> 30:37.206
Sir, can I borrow your phone?
Please!

30:37.241 --> 30:39.637
Your phone?
Can I use it?

30:40.574 --> 30:42.640
My watch,
you like my watch?

30:42.675 --> 30:44.950
Here, for you.

30:44.985 --> 30:46.182
For you.
Phone.

30:46.217 --> 30:48.514
Thank you.

30:48.549 --> 30:51.022
(line ringing)

30:51.057 --> 30:53.486
DEACON: Hondo?
Deacon, it's me. Do you copy?

30:53.521 --> 30:55.686
DEACON: We're airborne,
we're looking for you.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.424
Any chance you know
your coordinates?

30:57.459 --> 30:59.525
No, I don't.
We're in some village

30:59.560 --> 31:02.132
about eight miles due north
of the ruins by the river.

31:02.167 --> 31:04.299
All right, you hang in there.
We're on our way.

31:04.334 --> 31:05.531
Copy that.

31:09.471 --> 31:11.042
Hang on.

31:11.077 --> 31:12.604
20 years from now, you're gonna
be drinking a cold beer

31:12.639 --> 31:14.507
bragging about how your friend
Hondo saved your life.

31:14.542 --> 31:16.575
(both laugh)
I don't think you get to be

31:16.610 --> 31:18.610
the hero this time, I'm sorry.

31:18.645 --> 31:20.579
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, stay awake, stay awake.

31:20.614 --> 31:22.647
You ain't dying on me today,
Joe. You got a wife and kids.

31:23.683 --> 31:25.551
(rumbling nearby)

31:25.586 --> 31:28.290
Hey, hey! You hear that?
You hear that? They're coming.

31:28.325 --> 31:29.962
You're gonna make it.

31:39.303 --> 31:41.567
I think you spoke
too soon, mate.

31:50.380 --> 31:52.248
Someone got to them
just before us.

31:52.283 --> 31:54.250
That blood must be Joe's.
Hondo wasn't lying about him

31:54.285 --> 31:56.054
being in bad shape.

31:56.089 --> 31:58.155
(speaks Burmese)
DEACON: Somchai?

31:58.190 --> 31:59.750
Hey, they obviously know
something, but they won't talk.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.389
Someone has to have
seen something.

32:01.424 --> 32:04.062
The men that were here,
which way did they go?

32:04.097 --> 32:06.691
(speaks Burmese)

32:08.530 --> 32:10.464
Tan.

32:12.435 --> 32:13.599
That's Hondo's watch.

32:13.634 --> 32:15.535
Tan, that's Hondo's watch!

32:15.570 --> 32:17.405
Hey!

32:17.440 --> 32:19.374
Stop!

32:21.213 --> 32:22.773
Hey! Stop! Hey!

32:22.808 --> 32:24.280
Somchai, tell him that
he's not in trouble.

32:24.315 --> 32:26.579
I just need to know, the
man whose watch that is,

32:26.614 --> 32:29.153
where did he go?
(speaks Burmese)

32:34.688 --> 32:36.589
The Ghost Man took them.

32:36.624 --> 32:38.558
TAN:
The Ghost Man?

32:55.445 --> 32:58.314
LUCA:
LAPD, you got
to clear out of here. Go.

32:59.779 --> 33:01.614
22 to 28-David. Status?

33:01.649 --> 33:04.056
28-David. In position.

33:04.091 --> 33:06.223
Plainclothes confirmed
our suspect's inside.

33:06.258 --> 33:08.390
He's alone, sitting
at a table by the window.

33:08.425 --> 33:10.458
Do not let this go sideways.

33:10.493 --> 33:11.789
All right, on my count.

33:11.824 --> 33:15.100
Three, two, one, initiate.

33:16.433 --> 33:18.400
LAPD SWAT!
LAPD!

33:18.435 --> 33:20.435
Hands on the table!
Put your hands on the table!

33:20.470 --> 33:22.767
Put it down!

33:22.802 --> 33:24.472
Where's Hondo?

33:24.507 --> 33:27.343
You really think I'm gonna
help you find your friend?

33:27.378 --> 33:28.839
STREET:
You know where Hondo is?

33:28.874 --> 33:30.610
You better start talking now.

33:33.318 --> 33:35.450
The mohinga here's
the best in the city.

33:35.485 --> 33:37.122
Why don't you join me?

33:37.157 --> 33:38.585
Hey! Focus right here!

33:38.620 --> 33:40.521
STREET:
Listen.

33:40.556 --> 33:42.127
We know that your boss has him
in Thailand.

33:42.162 --> 33:43.788
What's he done with him?

33:43.823 --> 33:46.131
Your friend meddled
where he didn't belong,

33:46.166 --> 33:49.134
and the rest is just
the inevitable conclusion.

33:49.169 --> 33:50.762
Where is he?

33:50.797 --> 33:53.765
Even if I told you,
what are you going to do, hmm?

33:53.800 --> 33:56.405
Your friend is 8,000 miles

33:56.440 --> 33:57.802
from here.

33:57.837 --> 34:00.310
His time is up.

34:01.079 --> 34:03.643
Nothing you do
will help him now.

34:06.351 --> 34:08.087
I'm going hands-on.

34:10.817 --> 34:12.817
You enjoying this
as much as I am?

34:12.852 --> 34:14.885
Ooh, to the right an inch.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.755
Hey!

34:16.790 --> 34:18.856
Hands off!
Give me that back!

34:18.891 --> 34:20.825
(grunts)

34:20.860 --> 34:22.629
POWELL:
Big mistake.

34:22.664 --> 34:25.599
And for the record,
an inch would be generous.

34:26.767 --> 34:28.701
If he knows about Hondo...

34:28.736 --> 34:30.307
He's been in contact.

34:30.342 --> 34:32.342
Check for recent calls
to or from Thailand.

34:36.348 --> 34:38.513
HONDO:
Come on, Joe.

34:40.682 --> 34:43.155
(grunts)

34:46.193 --> 34:48.358
(groans)

34:53.728 --> 34:56.432
Deac, our L.A. suspect

34:56.467 --> 34:57.829
just traded calls
with a satellite phone

34:57.864 --> 35:00.172
not far from your position.

35:00.207 --> 35:01.866
I'm sending you coordinates now.

35:01.901 --> 35:04.176
Roger that,
Commander.

35:06.939 --> 35:09.907
If you kill us, Thai and U.S.
authorities will hunt you down

35:09.942 --> 35:12.217
to the end of the earth.
You're a dead man walking.

35:12.252 --> 35:14.615
Do you think that's a threat?

35:14.650 --> 35:16.650
You haven't heard?

35:16.685 --> 35:18.718
I am already dead.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.821
I'm a ghost,
and a ghost cannot be killed.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.726
But you two,
on the other hand...

35:28.367 --> 35:30.532
Thet, come here.

35:30.567 --> 35:32.435
Take it.

35:35.341 --> 35:38.771
Put the bullet right here.

35:44.317 --> 35:46.614
What are you waiting for?!

35:46.649 --> 35:47.978
Do it!

35:48.013 --> 35:49.848
Kill him!

36:05.338 --> 36:07.536
He's my nephew.

36:07.571 --> 36:09.439
But sometimes
I don't think

36:09.474 --> 36:11.837
my blood runs through his veins.

36:13.940 --> 36:16.809
(gunfire)
(speaking Burmese)

36:26.359 --> 36:27.556
One gunman down.

36:27.591 --> 36:29.426
Tan, cover me.

36:30.693 --> 36:31.725
Move.

36:33.564 --> 36:36.334
(Zaw Min shouting in Burmese)

36:38.338 --> 36:39.403
Come!

36:42.639 --> 36:44.936
(grunting)

36:52.979 --> 36:55.518
(grunting)

36:56.455 --> 36:57.553
(groans)

36:57.588 --> 36:59.720
(grunting)

36:59.755 --> 37:01.557
(grunts)

37:01.592 --> 37:03.394
(shouts)

37:03.429 --> 37:05.924
All right, we're good.
Let's move.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.795
(grunting)

37:13.538 --> 37:15.637
(yells)

37:15.672 --> 37:18.035

37:22.811 --> 37:24.382
DEACON:
Hondo!

37:24.417 --> 37:26.516
HONDO:
Deac, Tan.

37:26.551 --> 37:28.650
I got you, come on.

37:28.685 --> 37:30.520
Joe. You got to help Joe.

37:30.555 --> 37:32.786
He's in bad shape, you got
to get him to a medic ASAP.

37:32.821 --> 37:34.623
Hey! Where the hell do
you think you're going?
I'm going after Zaw Min.

37:34.658 --> 37:36.658
He took his nephew.
I'm not letting him get away.

37:36.693 --> 37:38.759
Give me a gun.
Hondo, hold up, you are

37:38.794 --> 37:40.563
in bad shape, and you are not
going anywhere by yourself.

37:40.598 --> 37:41.762
Okay, fine, you, me and Tan,
but let's go.

37:41.797 --> 37:43.335
We're wasting time!
Listen to your friend,

37:43.370 --> 37:45.634
Hondo. You won't catch him.
Those tunnels are a maze.

37:45.669 --> 37:47.801
If you get in,
you won't find your way out.

37:47.836 --> 37:49.572
But what about the boy?
What about Thet?

37:49.607 --> 37:51.002
That kid saved my life.
I know.

37:51.037 --> 37:52.707
But there's nothing we can
do about that right now.

37:52.742 --> 37:54.775
We got to get Joe to a hospital.
We got to go right now!

37:54.810 --> 37:56.513
Come on, help me up.
(grunts)

37:56.548 --> 37:58.350
Help me up.

37:58.385 --> 37:59.813
DEACON:
Come on.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.485
Come on.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.915
Let's go.

38:04.490 --> 38:07.458
♪ ♪

38:07.493 --> 38:09.823
(indistinct chatter)

38:09.858 --> 38:11.363
HICKS:
Command to D-team.

38:11.398 --> 38:13.893
Good news. Hondo's safe.

38:13.928 --> 38:15.829
They got him.
Aw, thanks, Commander.

38:15.864 --> 38:17.765
Hell yeah, dude.
Thank God.

38:20.473 --> 38:22.473
(panting)
Hondo!

38:23.509 --> 38:24.607
Nichelle.

38:24.642 --> 38:26.444
Hey.
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

38:26.479 --> 38:28.413
I'm okay,
I'm okay, I'm fine.

38:28.448 --> 38:30.481
Thanks to these guys,
and my team back home,

38:30.516 --> 38:32.450
I'm okay.

38:32.485 --> 38:34.584
How's Joe?
Is he still in surgery?

38:34.619 --> 38:36.685
Yeah, but it's not looking good.
May's with him.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.753
She raced to the hospital
as soon as you called us.

38:38.788 --> 38:41.085
I told her I'd stay
and look after the kids.

38:42.121 --> 38:44.396
I was so worried
about you today.

38:44.431 --> 38:46.497
I'm sorry you had
to go through all that.

38:47.333 --> 38:49.665
Well, you're here now,
that's all that matters.

38:50.701 --> 38:52.536
Okay.

38:52.571 --> 38:54.571
Hey, I've got something.

38:55.772 --> 38:57.101
Hey, Hondo?

38:57.136 --> 38:59.708
I should go
and check on the kids.
All right, go, go.

38:59.743 --> 39:02.447
Forces just raided the site
of Zaw Min's heroin factory.

39:02.482 --> 39:04.812
They moved everything,
the whole operation, gone.

39:04.847 --> 39:06.451
He must've cleared out,
knowing you were coming.

39:06.486 --> 39:08.112
What about Thet,
and the children?

39:08.147 --> 39:09.652
They're gone, too.

39:09.687 --> 39:11.181
But we're chasing down leads.
We'll find them.

39:11.216 --> 39:13.084
Then I got to stay here and
help. I made Thet a promise.

39:13.119 --> 39:15.086
I'm not leaving
until I know he's safe.

39:15.121 --> 39:17.055
The two of you should
head back to L.A., though.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.761
Are you kidding? Split up again?
Look what just happened.

39:19.796 --> 39:22.632
Hondo, we're a team. We're
not leaving here without you.

39:26.803 --> 39:29.100
Hondo, oh!

39:29.135 --> 39:31.102
Man, it's good
to hear your voice.

39:31.137 --> 39:33.005
HONDO: Thank you
for everything you did.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.710
Well, what else
were we gonna do?

39:34.745 --> 39:36.448
Sit around on our asses?

39:36.483 --> 39:37.944
How's your friend doing?

39:37.979 --> 39:39.550
We're still waiting on news.

39:39.585 --> 39:41.519
You tell his wife
that he's in all our prayers.

39:41.554 --> 39:43.719
I will do.
HICKS: And yes.

39:43.754 --> 39:45.589
HONDO: Yes, what, sir?
Well, you were about to ask me

39:45.624 --> 39:48.020
if I'd sign off on you
staying a while longer.

39:48.055 --> 39:50.495
I figured as much, so I already
signed the paperwork.

39:50.530 --> 39:52.189
Thank you, Commander. Thank you.

39:52.224 --> 39:55.093
I want you all back here
in one piece, understood?

39:57.097 --> 39:59.229
That's an order.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.472
Copy that, sir.
