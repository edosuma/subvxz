WEBVTT

00:11.340 --> 00:13.250
Now, let's see.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.290
Yeah, a few of the red ones,
please.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.860
Special someone, sir?
None more so.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.650
They say "truest love", red
tulips. Did you know that?

00:23.660 --> 00:24.850
No, I didn't.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.090
For every bloom a meaning,
sir, and every colour too.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.370
Might the lady care for
another?

00:29.380 --> 00:31.060
Yeah. Yeah, she likes these.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.500
Love forever lasting.

00:36.940 --> 00:40.210
Go on, then, let's have a
couple of the yellow ones,
then I'm off.

00:40.220 --> 00:42.820
Well, girl? What meaning these?

00:45.140 --> 00:46.500
Love without hope.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.420
It's only bloody flowers, innit?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.860
Rose?

01:12.020 --> 01:14.460
Rose, girl, what happened?

01:21.980 --> 01:23.890
You're leaving?

01:23.900 --> 01:25.140
What else can I do?

01:26.620 --> 01:29.890
He owns this playhouse,
Bennet, but he don't own me.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.090
Well...

01:31.100 --> 01:32.650
What'll you do, girl?

01:32.660 --> 01:35.690
Find honest work somewhere
I ain't told to let the boss rut

01:35.700 --> 01:37.770
and grunt atop me for the
privilege of it.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.060
I just...

01:40.820 --> 01:43.850
I wanted something
better for meself, Bennet.

01:43.860 --> 01:46.850
Rose, there will be something better,
girl.

01:46.860 --> 01:51.940
I mean, you've more wits and heart
about you than anyone I...

01:56.940 --> 02:00.660
You'll see, things'll work out.

02:03.020 --> 02:04.650
Things do work out.

02:04.660 --> 02:07.580
She's a lucky lady, Bennet,
your Bella.

02:13.660 --> 02:14.700
I'd, uh...

02:16.540 --> 02:18.260
I'd better be on me way.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.700
I'm sorry, Rose, I am.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.530
Pardon my lateness, love.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.140
The inspector needed me...

03:02.860 --> 03:04.380
Bella?

03:07.580 --> 03:09.220
Bella?

04:24.980 --> 04:28.090
You really need me to tell you this
wasn't an accident?

04:28.100 --> 04:29.890
Smells fishy, all right.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.450
What is that stench?

04:31.460 --> 04:32.490
It's whale oil.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.740
This place was torched with
whale oil.

04:36.020 --> 04:39.130
Oi! It's the bloody Jews!

04:39.140 --> 04:41.820
Hang a noose round
the lot of the kike bastards!

04:44.220 --> 04:46.450
Who gave you these, boy?
Some bloke.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.050
Paid me to spread 'em.
What "bloke"?

04:48.060 --> 04:50.450
I dunno! His face was hid!
How about you leave him

04:50.460 --> 04:51.770
and chase after the yids what
done this?

04:51.780 --> 04:53.650
You seem pretty sure
who lit that match, son.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.300
Left their mark, plain as day.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.260
Is that Hebrew?

05:06.980 --> 05:08.930
Flight, get a photographer.

05:08.940 --> 05:09.980
Yes, sir.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.330
Sergeant.

05:16.340 --> 05:18.170
I was expecting you at the...

05:18.180 --> 05:19.460
church.

05:20.740 --> 05:21.970
It's not like her, sir.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.100
I know my Bella,
she's in trouble, I can feel it.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.940
I've, er... I've scoured the streets.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.460
I don't know what else to do.

05:32.020 --> 05:34.450
You're certain
there's no signs of abduction?

05:34.460 --> 05:38.050
I don't think so.
Least, not what I could see.

05:38.060 --> 05:41.090
Bennet, when you first started
courting Bella...

05:41.100 --> 05:42.450
..I had concern...

05:42.460 --> 05:43.500
Reid.

05:45.500 --> 05:50.330
Concern?
Not every wild cat can be tamed.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.500
You're wrong about her.
Look, Drake.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.850
Did you talk to Susan?

05:56.860 --> 05:59.940
She's not back on her back! Only to
see if she has any other ideas.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.290
No!

06:02.300 --> 06:05.090
Why don't me and you go ask
her, huh?

06:05.100 --> 06:08.610
Long Susan threw you out.
Are you welcome there?

06:08.620 --> 06:11.900
About as welcome as your
advice on every man's
goddamn marriage.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.090
I just...

06:21.100 --> 06:24.210
I just need a small sum for
lodging, till I find a new
playhouse.

06:24.220 --> 06:27.850
Rose, I've got nothing to give
you.

06:27.860 --> 06:30.500
The music hall remains your
best option.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.650
So I should just...crawl back to
Blewett, then, should I?

06:36.660 --> 06:38.410
Let him take what he wants?

06:38.420 --> 06:41.020
Doesn't matter how hard we
try, does it, girl?

06:42.140 --> 06:44.210
In the end, we pay with the basest
coin of all.

06:48.300 --> 06:53.020
Sorry, are we interrupting
something? It's about Bella.

06:55.060 --> 06:58.530
She never spoke of family,
friends or anyone

06:58.540 --> 07:01.420
and I learnt long ago in the running
of this house not to pry.

07:02.940 --> 07:04.940
Well, was there ever a...

07:06.060 --> 07:08.780
..another...gentleman?

07:09.780 --> 07:11.500
Before the sergeant, that is.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.970
Not known to me. Rose?

07:15.980 --> 07:17.610
Nor me.

07:17.620 --> 07:20.410
I am sorry, Sergeant.
I wish I could tell you more.

07:20.420 --> 07:25.220
I have matters to attend. You're
welcome to finish your tea.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.820
Susan.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.300
Susan!

07:36.980 --> 07:38.770
Goddamn it!
Don't touch me.

07:38.780 --> 07:41.090
And do not call again on this
house, unannounced.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.610
Or what? You'll call the
police?

07:43.620 --> 07:44.980
This is my home, Susan!

07:51.020 --> 07:52.460
This is my home.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.450
Bennet...
You keep away from me, girl.

07:57.460 --> 07:58.730
Bennet, I'm your friend.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.730
No!

08:00.740 --> 08:03.170
No, I should've been home.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.530
Not with you.

08:04.540 --> 08:06.900
If I'd been home, she wouldn't be
gone, would she?

08:08.060 --> 08:11.020
Nothing good comes from being
round you.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.020
Get back!

08:16.500 --> 08:18.380
It was the Catholics!

08:49.100 --> 08:52.770
What sorrow the Catholics have
visited on us, Detective Reid.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.290
Inspector.
Mr Bloom.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.540
A religious war brews in
Whitechapel.

08:58.980 --> 09:02.690
Mrs Goldstone said...
you were looking for me.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.250
I hope someday
it is happier circumstances

09:05.260 --> 09:06.780
that bring me to your door.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.940
Inspector, save your
photographs. I saw the graffito
for myself.

09:14.580 --> 09:17.330
"Shall a trumpet
be blown in the city

09:17.340 --> 09:19.380
"and the people not quake in
fear?

09:20.540 --> 09:24.930
"Shall there be evil in the city,
if the Lord has not done it?"

09:24.940 --> 09:26.340
The Torah?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.730
Is it your belief that the Jews

09:29.740 --> 09:31.970
are responsible for the burning of
that church?

09:31.980 --> 09:34.820
Are any so radical in their
views known to you?

09:35.900 --> 09:37.650
A boy was...

09:37.660 --> 09:39.450
flinging these...

09:39.460 --> 09:40.850
outside the shul

09:40.860 --> 09:42.850
like confetti.
A boy was pamphleteering

09:42.860 --> 09:44.370
outside the church also.

09:44.380 --> 09:46.450
Peddling anti-Semitic
sentiment.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.690
A striking coincidence, would
you not say?

09:49.700 --> 09:52.610
A call to Jews for savage
retribution.

09:52.620 --> 09:57.010
"Scorch the Gentiles as
before with righteous fire for
their desecration."

10:00.860 --> 10:03.370
He says no member of this
shul would write such words,

10:03.380 --> 10:04.620
nor seek such violence.

10:05.780 --> 10:07.850
And he is afraid what will
befall us.

10:07.860 --> 10:10.730
I will not allow the fomenting
of hatred in this community.

10:10.740 --> 10:14.050
Inspector...the men of these
streets are no brotherhood.

10:14.060 --> 10:17.050
We are neighbours
of circumstance, necessity.

10:17.060 --> 10:20.250
The fence of tolerance
that pens us is frail.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.940
We are not animals here, Mr Bloom.

10:23.980 --> 10:26.260
Now that is a radical view.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.980
Bella?

10:48.620 --> 10:50.130
Bella?

10:50.140 --> 10:51.450
Oh.

10:51.460 --> 10:54.180
I... Forgive me.

10:56.380 --> 10:57.420
Forgive me.

11:09.340 --> 11:13.090
You're welcome to join us, if you
like. We saw you sat alone.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.260
Maggie.

11:15.580 --> 11:20.380
What I'd like, Maggie, is to be left
in peace with my gin.

11:21.780 --> 11:22.820
I didn't mean...

11:24.140 --> 11:27.130
I just thought you...
Was a time not long past

11:27.140 --> 11:31.140
I was needful of friends and
was lucky to find some, is all.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.940
I'll leave you be.

11:44.020 --> 11:47.050
Evening, pretty one. Tug us off?

11:47.060 --> 11:48.380
I'll rip it off!

11:59.420 --> 12:00.940
Hello!

12:07.180 --> 12:08.330
Bella.

12:08.340 --> 12:09.490
Where have you...?

12:09.500 --> 12:12.570
Bennet, this is Gabriel.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.210
Who?!
My uncle.

12:14.220 --> 12:16.050
Your uncle?!

12:16.060 --> 12:17.450
Gabriel Kane.

12:17.460 --> 12:18.500
I...

12:21.620 --> 12:23.330
Where were you?

12:23.340 --> 12:25.300
I've been out of my mind, girl!
I left a note.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.220
A note?

12:30.300 --> 12:32.100
No, this...

12:33.700 --> 12:35.090
I swear it wasn't there.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.770
Bella, I've been searching all
over. I thought...

12:37.780 --> 12:39.090
I'm so sorry.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.050
The apology should be mine,
Mr Drake.

12:41.060 --> 12:45.340
My visit was unannounced and I
brought with me the worst of news.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.450
My daughter, sir.

12:50.460 --> 12:51.820
Lily.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.100
For some months
the typhus had clawed at her.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.370
Lily had uttered many times a
wish to see once more the
sweet face of whom she,

13:03.380 --> 13:07.260
in happier times, had cherished,
dear as a sister.

13:12.060 --> 13:15.530
When, by chance, Bella's whereabouts
became known to me,

13:15.540 --> 13:17.330
I came without a second
thought

13:17.340 --> 13:22.420
and, in no less haste, Bella
rushed to spend the night by
Lily's side.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.010
Did she...?

13:26.020 --> 13:27.420
She passed, sir.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.010
Before sunrise.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.420
I am sorry.

13:33.340 --> 13:37.810
Bella never spoke of any family. May
I ask of Lily's mother?

13:37.820 --> 13:40.740
The sun does not rise upon a
single day without my
yearning for her.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.460
This meal is delicious, my dear.

13:44.860 --> 13:47.220
I feel blessed to be in your home.

13:48.380 --> 13:50.970
There is no tie that binds
more than family.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.420
Do you not agree, Mr Drake?

13:53.980 --> 13:58.740
Oh, I, er... I never knew much of
family. Until Bella.

14:03.500 --> 14:07.810
She tells me you took the queen's
shilling. Egypt, was it?

14:07.820 --> 14:09.690
For a time. You?

14:09.700 --> 14:11.770
No such privilege, sir.

14:11.780 --> 14:15.530
My travel was undertaken not for
queen and country, but for study.

14:15.540 --> 14:19.660
I travelled through Sinai
en route to Persia, Bengal.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.540
The study of what?

14:23.780 --> 14:25.140
All kinds.

14:26.580 --> 14:29.100
Exploration, anthropology.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.620
A seeking, you might say.

14:34.020 --> 14:35.860
Seeking of?

14:37.660 --> 14:38.700
Truth.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.850
I stayed for a time
at a shelter for women, but...

14:49.860 --> 14:53.330
These streets deal a poor hand to men
and women alike.

14:53.340 --> 14:55.540
We're sisters and brothers here.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.770
All of you live here?

14:59.780 --> 15:02.170
And plenty more besides.

15:02.180 --> 15:07.970
They'll demolish all this soon
enough for roads or trains or
factories

15:07.980 --> 15:10.210
but until these bricks are rubble,

15:10.220 --> 15:14.260
any who come needful of shelter or
friendship can find both.

15:35.980 --> 15:38.490
There's soup, if you're hungry.
Oh...

15:38.500 --> 15:40.210
I have new friends too.

15:40.220 --> 15:43.250
Father will be happy with you.

15:43.260 --> 15:46.770
Samuel, this is Rose.
How do, Rose.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.490
Samuel is one of
Father's finest students.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.770
You did well last night.

15:52.780 --> 15:56.290
"Thou brakest the head of leviathan
in pieces, gavest to his people

15:56.300 --> 15:58.140
"inhabiting the wilderness."

15:59.420 --> 16:01.900
Excuse me, Rose. I am requested.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.610
What's in there?

16:11.620 --> 16:13.140
That's Father's chamber.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.460
Who is this Father?

16:16.580 --> 16:19.250
He found this place for us.
Made us a family.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.650
You'll meet him tomorrow.

16:20.660 --> 16:23.370
A bed for the night, Maggie.
That's all.

16:23.380 --> 16:26.010
Come the morning, I make my
own way.

16:26.020 --> 16:29.250
I can't make you trust us, Rose.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.970
But I can tell you
that each soul here,

16:30.980 --> 16:34.050
when first they came, had reason
never to trust again.

16:34.060 --> 16:37.020
Rest. You will not be troubled.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.380
Bennet.

17:02.820 --> 17:03.980
Bella...

17:09.180 --> 17:10.819
Bella, I thought you'd...

17:13.140 --> 17:15.089
That note. It wasn't there.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.250
It was there, Bennet.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.380
I swear.
It was there.

17:20.700 --> 17:24.780
You never once spoke of them.
Gabriel. Lily. Anyone.

17:25.980 --> 17:28.540
It felt like they were in another
life.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.380
I'm sorry.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.890
I'm so sorry.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.780
No, that's all right.
It's all right, my love.

18:27.260 --> 18:29.980
This entire day
can kiss my holiest of holies.

18:32.260 --> 18:34.570
Home. You with me?

18:34.580 --> 18:36.090
It's not your home, man, it's mine.

18:36.100 --> 18:39.370
Look at these, will you? Do they not
strike you similar?

18:39.380 --> 18:41.100
Reid, listen to me.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.250
First, I'm gonna drink this.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.090
Then I'm gonna throw up.

18:47.100 --> 18:50.690
And then...I'm gonna drink this.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.250
And then I'm gonna pass out.

18:52.260 --> 18:56.290
Now, you wanna make use of
my brain, do it now.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.170
I know a thing or two about
bone setting.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.420
But you're shit outta luck
when it comes to typesetting.

19:02.020 --> 19:05.700
And on that, I bid...adieu.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.410
Panic in the air, streets
on the brink. Just like the
good old days.

19:32.420 --> 19:33.770
And now this.

19:33.780 --> 19:36.500
Circulating on Underwood
Street this morning.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.810
Yeah. Heard St Anne's
Church took a pasting the like
of the synagogue.

19:40.820 --> 19:43.530
Whoever sets Jews against Gentiles
will do the same for the Irish.

19:43.540 --> 19:46.610
The pamphlets. Did they come off the
same press?

19:46.620 --> 19:49.490
You must have me confused with the
psychical two doors down.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.170
If you wish my torch of truth
to illumine the holy mysteries

19:52.180 --> 19:56.050
of ink and type,
quid pro quo, Inspector.

19:56.060 --> 19:58.170
That's foreign, chum.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.170
You must have an ear for it.
Me old china.

20:01.180 --> 20:03.290
A church burns on our
doorstep, man!

20:03.300 --> 20:06.380
This is no penny dreadful to be eked
out over your grubby pages.

20:11.700 --> 20:15.610
You came up through the
print-works, did you not?

20:15.620 --> 20:18.770
An ink-streaked urchin,
giddy with hot lead

20:18.780 --> 20:21.370
and hungry to one day rule
the Fourth Estate.

20:21.380 --> 20:25.130
Truly, William Stead
must quake at your rivalry.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.900
"Quid pro quo"?

20:29.340 --> 20:35.450
You seem to labour under the
belief that we have some
"arrangement".

20:35.460 --> 20:38.530
A symbiosis,
as the biologists would say.

20:38.540 --> 20:42.540
But there is no biologist yet that
has a name for what you are.

20:43.940 --> 20:44.970
Come, Sergeant.

20:44.980 --> 20:47.970
We need the opinion of a
professional, not a muck-shoveller.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.020
Wait.

21:00.340 --> 21:01.380
Right, see this.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.450
The smudge?

21:03.460 --> 21:04.900
We call it a slur.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.610
See, some of these are printed fine
enough, but every few,

21:08.620 --> 21:10.180
a slur.
Meaning?

21:11.300 --> 21:13.370
Looks like they were
printed on an Albion.

21:13.380 --> 21:16.530
Lovely old press,
but a bugger with the trems.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.330
It's vibrations.
From?

21:18.340 --> 21:21.210
Door slam, floor thump,
anything that would make the
room shake.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.650
Christ, you could fart, it would make
the platen do a judder.

21:23.660 --> 21:26.170
These slurs. They're regular.

21:26.180 --> 21:27.690
Same disturbance each time.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.540
Then go look for a clockwork
flatulent. Look, I've work to do,
gentlemen.

21:34.180 --> 21:35.540
Sergeant, I, er...

21:37.420 --> 21:40.180
Bennet, I... Forgive me...

21:41.860 --> 21:43.740
I am happy for you she's
home safe.

21:46.980 --> 21:50.380
I hope some day...
I'm able to say to you likewise.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.890
Trains. Could it be the trains?

22:01.900 --> 22:04.130
Years back
I lived in a place by the tracks.

22:04.140 --> 22:07.890
Room shook like an earthquake
every half-hour.

22:07.900 --> 22:10.650
Can you determine if
these pamphlets were printed
using the same ink?

22:10.660 --> 22:13.410
Like Friedlieb Runge does.
Friedlieb who?

22:13.420 --> 22:16.610
Runge. I saw a lecture about his
experiments with dye.

22:16.620 --> 22:17.890
Colour patterns.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.650
Those wily cabbage-eaters.
Is it possible?

22:20.660 --> 22:23.690
Yeah, in theory, I guess, sure.
But what would be the point?

22:23.700 --> 22:27.730
There are maybe seven or
eight brands of ink vended
wholesale to printers.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.930
So, even if you found the
match, Reid...

22:29.940 --> 22:31.650
Yes, the field remains wide.

22:31.660 --> 22:34.010
But how many print-shops
who purchase this type of ink

22:34.020 --> 22:36.500
are situated near enough
to rail tracks for this slur?

22:42.900 --> 22:46.810
It's lucky for you I'm a
gambling man, Reid. Send
Flight shopping.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.060
I need samples.

23:10.980 --> 23:14.370
Here's your ink, right here.
No doubt about it. Compounds.

23:14.380 --> 23:16.330
You see?
Precisely the same.

23:16.340 --> 23:17.810
Heylin's Black Empire,
number 4.

23:17.820 --> 23:19.850
Who uses that?

23:19.860 --> 23:22.970
There's one, um...two printers
that buy it, near enough
tracks.

23:22.980 --> 23:25.490
But this one, it's right on
the London & Blackwall, sir.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.580
Get me a hansom!

23:27.820 --> 23:28.900
Gaddis!

23:34.500 --> 23:37.380
Here's the Albion, sir.

23:46.580 --> 23:48.340
Whale oil?

23:57.900 --> 23:59.420
Samuel Gaddis.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.450
Gaddis...

24:04.460 --> 24:06.050
Was it you...alone?

24:09.620 --> 24:11.140
Father.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.930
Why? To what end spread
such hate?

24:36.940 --> 24:38.580
We got him, leastwise.

24:50.060 --> 24:52.500
Oh, you're still here.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.130
I started reading and...

24:57.140 --> 25:00.850
That's Father's. He's written
so many. What did you think?

25:00.860 --> 25:02.690
Do you believe all this, Maggie?

25:02.700 --> 25:04.970
That there's some better
world to come?

25:04.980 --> 25:07.730
There is, Rose.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.810
I've seen it.

25:09.820 --> 25:11.330
I couldn't to begin with, of course.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.970
I...
I had my doubts, as you do.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.340
But Father helped me to see.

25:17.460 --> 25:21.460
And the truth, when at last we
glimpse it, can be so bright, it
dazzles.

25:22.740 --> 25:26.210
Stay a little. Meet Father.
He'll help you understand.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.780
I don't think so, Maggie.

25:28.900 --> 25:32.900
Thank you for your kindness,
but...I'll make my way.

25:33.940 --> 25:35.290
Forgive me.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.940
You must be hungry.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.660
You're a kind soul, Maggie.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.620
That's what Father says.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.860
I do so wish you would stay
to meet him.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.780
Father, I cannot.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.130
The years without you
have passed as centuries.

26:10.140 --> 26:12.890
Fate has brought you back to me.

26:12.900 --> 26:16.170
Now you must renounce your adultery
with this man Bennet.

26:16.180 --> 26:18.410
What matter it was one night
or two years past

26:18.420 --> 26:20.050
when the hurt remains afire?

26:20.060 --> 26:23.980
He is a good man. And I would not
have you lie to him.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.930
I love him!

26:26.940 --> 26:28.610
And I love you.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.610
I love Bennet.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.770
Then bring him to us.

26:32.780 --> 26:35.020
I have waited for you.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.180
As did Lily.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.010
She howled for you...

26:43.020 --> 26:44.650
Gabriel, don't!

26:44.660 --> 26:46.300
If you'd stayed...

26:47.740 --> 26:49.330
..she'd have found the will
to fight the illness.

26:49.340 --> 26:50.860
I had to leave.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.410
I was a child myself.

26:54.420 --> 26:56.660
But you're a child no longer.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.690
Do you not think your Bennet...

27:10.700 --> 27:12.540
who has seen, just as I...

27:13.900 --> 27:15.620
..the vicious face of Man...

27:19.100 --> 27:20.860
..who has waded in the blood...

27:22.620 --> 27:25.810
..who this very day takes desperate
threadbare broom

27:25.820 --> 27:27.420
to the filth of the streets...

27:30.180 --> 27:33.460
Do you not think such a man would
understand our work here?

27:36.020 --> 27:39.660
I would not have you leave him to the
sordid vanity of this world.

27:43.220 --> 27:45.180
If you love him, my Bella...

27:47.140 --> 27:48.540
..save him.

28:05.420 --> 28:07.580
Philip! Maggie!

28:19.340 --> 28:20.540
You go round.

28:27.820 --> 28:32.130
Rose? You're safe with us.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.460
Rose!

28:45.020 --> 28:46.460
Save him.

28:48.780 --> 28:51.130
This book, The Golden Bough,

28:51.140 --> 28:53.930
it's extraordinary how he picks
together the common thread of...

28:53.940 --> 28:57.570
religion and mythology, folklore.

28:57.580 --> 29:00.220
God's a fairy tale. This is news?

29:01.580 --> 29:04.900
His thesis is somewhat more
intricate. Thesis?

29:06.740 --> 29:10.890
Man'll pin up any rag he can to
veil himself from the naked truth.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.420
There's a thesis.

29:13.860 --> 29:15.220
The naked truth being...?

29:17.620 --> 29:19.450
That we're born alone, we die alone,

29:19.460 --> 29:23.060
and not one thing in-between makes a
jot of goddamn sense.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.220
Pray with me.

29:33.780 --> 29:35.180
Say, Reid...

29:36.860 --> 29:38.570
This whole rumpus with
Drake's old lady.

29:38.580 --> 29:41.490
You really buy that long lost
uncle thing?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.170
Not especially.

29:43.180 --> 29:45.730
No.
Question is, does Sergeant Drake?

29:45.740 --> 29:47.460
Good luck broaching that subject.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.890
You think him a cuckold?

29:49.900 --> 29:51.770
Love.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.890
Love someone, you gotta trust them.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.410
Love. All of it.
That's just an act of faith.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.700
If you don't got that, what's left?

30:00.620 --> 30:03.370
You're saying he should
demand to know the truth.

30:03.380 --> 30:06.420
I'm saying I got a feeling
for why he hasn't.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.580
Man'll pin up any old rag.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.220
You're hurt.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.460
You hurt yourself.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.210
There's a bit of blood,
but it's not too deep.

30:37.700 --> 30:39.900
Er, just hold that tight.

30:43.860 --> 30:45.420
I was passing.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.770
No.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.490
What is it, girl?

31:03.500 --> 31:04.970
Not yet, Gabriel.

31:04.980 --> 31:06.130
No more lies.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.090
Not now! Get out!

31:08.100 --> 31:09.330
Explain yourselves!

31:09.340 --> 31:11.340
Is that not a wifely duty?

31:13.060 --> 31:14.250
Who are you?

31:14.260 --> 31:16.410
Will you have at me with your
billy club?

31:16.420 --> 31:19.410
Bennet, no! Leave him be,
I beg you. I'll explain.

31:19.420 --> 31:20.580
I beg you. Just go!

31:22.580 --> 31:25.820
Whoever you are,
you bring strife at your back.

31:26.940 --> 31:30.130
Now hear me good -
you come near her again,

31:30.140 --> 31:31.620
you'll wish it was a billy club.

31:32.900 --> 31:36.260
Now, get out of our home. Go!

31:49.980 --> 31:52.340
I lay all my love at your door,
Bella.

31:55.820 --> 31:58.900
There is no burden you can
share that I would not
shoulder beside you.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.090
So, please...

32:05.100 --> 32:07.210
just tell me.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.460
Who is he?

32:10.780 --> 32:11.820
Eh?

32:13.620 --> 32:14.660
Was he your...?

32:17.820 --> 32:20.540
Did you...work for him?

32:25.060 --> 32:29.450
Do you wonder, Bennet...
what turn life might have taken

32:29.460 --> 32:31.060
if you'd done things different?

32:32.140 --> 32:33.770
What things, girl?

32:33.780 --> 32:35.570
A left when you went right.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.460
A yes when you said no, anything.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.980
If you'd wed Rose in my
place, for instance.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.620
Do you think she'd have
made you happier?

32:50.820 --> 32:54.210
There is no man in this world has
ever known the happiness

32:54.220 --> 32:56.300
you have brought me, Bella.
But do you wonder?

32:57.580 --> 32:59.210
No, girl.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.020
Rose is...

33:02.180 --> 33:03.340
She was...

33:04.980 --> 33:07.010
W...

33:07.020 --> 33:10.420
I don't want to talk about Rose.
I want to talk about Gabriel.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.610
I think she'd have made you
happier, Bennet.

33:13.620 --> 33:15.180
Jesus!

33:19.340 --> 33:21.620
At least she never kept secrets
from me.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.730
He was about to set flame
to the English Martyrs.

33:37.740 --> 33:40.290
The church full for service.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.650
A constable was passing, saw him
ready bottles of whale oil outside.

33:43.660 --> 33:45.650
Made for him.

33:45.660 --> 33:48.020
At which he doused himself,
lit a match.

33:49.500 --> 33:50.530
Goddamn it!

33:50.540 --> 33:55.970
The constable said he was in the
grip of some...rapture.

33:55.980 --> 34:00.810
Incanting, ecstatic amid the
fire. Just as Gaddis did.

34:00.820 --> 34:06.090
These...fanatics would have
Whitechapel torn apart.

34:06.100 --> 34:07.460
Who are they?

34:09.340 --> 34:10.580
Sergeant?

34:12.780 --> 34:14.699
Forgive me, Inspector, I, um...

34:20.060 --> 34:21.179
Mrs Drake?

34:24.300 --> 34:25.860
Take the day, Bennet.

34:27.420 --> 34:29.010
There is work to be done, sir.

34:29.020 --> 34:31.210
And there are sometimes matters more
needful besides.

34:31.219 --> 34:33.570
I learned as much too late
and to my own cost.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.300
Go to her.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.460
Thank you, sir.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.020
Find something, man.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.980
Your brother Jacob gave himself this
morning unto the flame.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.810
Leapt forth,

35:00.820 --> 35:04.570
wings spread, as did Samuel Gaddis
before him.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.370
They did so with neither
fear nor sorrow,

35:07.380 --> 35:11.450
for they knew to which bright and
fabulous place they would soar.

35:11.460 --> 35:15.410
But, Father, Jacob was
stopped before...

35:15.420 --> 35:18.530
Do not think him
failed in his purpose.

35:18.540 --> 35:22.170
Jacob brought this day
a clarion to their door.

35:22.180 --> 35:26.570
It is from love we seek to stir the
lost flocks of this city,

35:26.580 --> 35:29.930
rouse them from their drone-lives of
prayer in false temples.

35:29.940 --> 35:33.980
It is from love
we set tribe against tribe.

35:35.460 --> 35:39.530
Only to teach them what hate is bred
from their dung-hill idolatries.

35:39.540 --> 35:42.290
And by the light of your steps,

35:42.300 --> 35:44.420
those lost flocks will soon follow.

35:45.540 --> 35:47.580
And by your love...

35:50.340 --> 35:53.180
..you will show them
the meaning of Faith.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.770
Bennet!

35:56.780 --> 35:59.250
Oh, thank Christ.
I was coming to find you.

35:59.260 --> 36:01.410
Not now, girl.
I saw her, Bennet...

36:01.420 --> 36:03.330
Bella, with a man.

36:03.340 --> 36:04.410
What man?

36:04.420 --> 36:06.090
They...

36:06.100 --> 36:07.650
They called him Father,

36:07.660 --> 36:09.740
but what I saw, it...

36:11.060 --> 36:12.210
I wouldn't lie to you, Bennet!

36:12.220 --> 36:15.260
Shut up, girl! I can't bear to see
her cuckold you.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.180
Rose, I...

36:22.780 --> 36:24.060
Rose!

36:34.020 --> 36:36.570
Vigilantes, Inspector.

36:36.580 --> 36:41.060
Protecting themselves
from the "Hebrew menace".

36:42.500 --> 36:43.820
Come.

36:47.060 --> 36:50.450
There is some kabbalah...here.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.890
The rest I cannot read,

36:52.900 --> 36:55.700
but I can tell you
it is the script of John Dee.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.330
Dee? The mathematician?

36:59.340 --> 37:00.530
Mathematician, yes.

37:00.540 --> 37:03.890
But alchemist also and
astrologer to the court of
Queen Elizabeth.

37:03.900 --> 37:05.690
A keen student of the occult
who came to believe

37:05.700 --> 37:08.130
he was conversing
with angels of apocalypse.

37:08.140 --> 37:10.970
This was their language. I need
to know who studies this.

37:10.980 --> 37:14.530
Inspector, there are many scholars
of such material.

37:14.540 --> 37:15.780
And their number grows.

37:16.780 --> 37:20.010
With its every triumph of discovery,
the Age takes hammer

37:20.020 --> 37:21.890
and chisel to Man's pillars.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.410
Is it so surprising there are those
in need of new pillars?

37:24.420 --> 37:28.170
No, not surprising, Mr Bloom.

37:28.180 --> 37:29.730
Dismaying.

37:29.740 --> 37:32.410
And I would not have thought you so
accommodating of hocus-pocus.

37:32.420 --> 37:34.570
Of course.

37:34.580 --> 37:38.730
What use the folly of God
to the rational mind?

37:38.740 --> 37:42.250
You are for Progress, Science, Truth.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.810
And you are not?
Oh, I am...

37:44.820 --> 37:47.450
rational, Inspector.

37:47.460 --> 37:52.570
And I hear, every day, men
such as yourself, who would
have us believe

37:52.580 --> 37:56.100
our journey to Truth
will set us free.

37:57.420 --> 38:01.980
But Man has no more desire for Truth
than a dung beetle.

38:03.300 --> 38:08.050
Like any animal,
he desires meat and sex.

38:08.060 --> 38:11.210
And like any animal
who feels himself caged by
what is...

38:11.220 --> 38:15.730
he will yearn for anything
that lies beyond the bars.

38:15.740 --> 38:18.060
Dee called it magic.
You call it progress.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.930
You are a cynic.
I am a scientist.

38:21.940 --> 38:24.210
The only thing as irrational
as faith in God

38:24.220 --> 38:26.010
is faith in Man.

38:26.020 --> 38:29.170
The printer who made these
said his last prayer

38:29.180 --> 38:31.170
and cut his own throat open
in front of me.

38:31.180 --> 38:34.250
I must know which "scholars" have
taken such leave of their reason.

38:34.260 --> 38:38.460
A printer? By what name?
Name of Gaddis. Samuel Gaddis.

38:39.460 --> 38:42.820
Inspector...are you familiar with the
Order of the Golden Dawn?

38:56.300 --> 38:59.890
Welcome to Isis-Urania.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.500
Jemima Swann.

39:03.020 --> 39:05.170
And you are...

39:05.180 --> 39:06.410
a policeman.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.210
I am Inspector Reid.

39:08.220 --> 39:12.810
And I need to know about Samuel
Gaddis. You interrupt my study,
Mr Reid.

39:12.820 --> 39:15.090
If your business here
concerns Mr Gaddis...

39:15.100 --> 39:20.700
Samuel Gaddis is dead, Miss Swann.
And my business concerns...this.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.490
This is not his own work.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.530
Then whose?

39:31.540 --> 39:33.650
Gaddis was...

39:33.660 --> 39:35.890
He was the disciple of a great
adept,

39:35.900 --> 39:37.690
a man named Gabriel Cain.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.010
Where is Cain?

39:39.020 --> 39:42.290
He too left, but this is his
work, I'm sure of it.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.530
Then help me find him.

39:44.540 --> 39:46.530
He disappeared.

39:46.540 --> 39:48.610
He was the finest scholar I've
known.

39:48.620 --> 39:52.410
He travelled further, read wider,
thought deeper than any other.

39:52.420 --> 39:56.410
But he saw only a world
drenched in its own cruelty.

39:56.420 --> 40:00.010
He came to believe that a great
cataclysm drew close,

40:00.020 --> 40:01.740
fit for such corruption.

40:06.780 --> 40:11.410
Kalki. Destroyer of Foulness
astride his white horse,

40:11.420 --> 40:13.900
sword of fire to cleave all
darkness.

40:15.300 --> 40:16.810
Gabriel believed...

40:16.820 --> 40:19.170
he was the sword of fire.

40:19.180 --> 40:20.730
Is he insane?

40:20.740 --> 40:23.690
He is a man of faith, not madness,
and that is why people follow him.

40:23.700 --> 40:24.970
And did you?

40:24.980 --> 40:28.850
Inspector, I expelled him from this
Temple,

40:28.860 --> 40:31.690
but a circle formed around him.
Gaddis.

40:31.700 --> 40:36.980
First among those who
believed Gabriel was their
shepherd to the future.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.220
And this.

40:40.540 --> 40:44.050
A clarion. Gabriel's own
testament.

40:44.060 --> 40:46.810
He spoke of leading his
followers from this world.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.930
And he is preparing to do so.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.730
What does that mean?
Is he going to kill them?

40:50.740 --> 40:52.570
No, Inspector.

40:52.580 --> 40:59.290
They will kill themselves...in
their numbers, in pure exaltation.

40:59.300 --> 41:03.050
There, at the founding of
Isis-Urania.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.860
It is the only likeness of him.

41:07.140 --> 41:08.530
This girl...

41:08.540 --> 41:10.210
She was his holy queen.

41:10.220 --> 41:12.450
Her name?

41:12.460 --> 41:14.620
He named her Bella.

41:18.060 --> 41:20.180
She is with child.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.260
Inspector...

41:55.620 --> 41:59.410
I cannot, Gabriel.
I will not bring him to you.

41:59.420 --> 42:02.780
Please...leave us be.

42:12.060 --> 42:13.820
Please come in, Mr Drake.

42:19.420 --> 42:21.690
Your love for him is not real,
Bella.

42:21.700 --> 42:22.730
It is.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.100
No, it is not!

42:25.460 --> 42:27.420
For me, your love is real.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.890
For him, there is nothing.

42:38.900 --> 42:41.100
Who are you?

42:42.500 --> 42:43.740
Where's my Bella?

42:45.300 --> 42:46.540
Come...

42:52.220 --> 42:53.620
What is this place?

43:04.500 --> 43:09.060
You see? It is destiny. He has come
without you having to bring him.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.260
Bella, what...?

43:16.060 --> 43:18.050
Who is he?

43:18.060 --> 43:19.650
Her teacher.

43:19.660 --> 43:22.250
Her saviour.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.740
And father of her child.

43:28.020 --> 43:29.500
She died, Bennet.

43:31.220 --> 43:33.500
Her name was Lily.

43:34.540 --> 43:36.010
I left...

43:36.020 --> 43:38.220
I left her...
She died for want of her mother.

43:41.940 --> 43:43.140
No...

43:44.140 --> 43:45.170
Bella.

43:45.180 --> 43:49.060
Bella wishes you, as do I...
to join us here.

43:51.100 --> 43:53.930
Let our Holy Family welcome you

43:53.940 --> 43:57.490
and save you from a world
you know to be black in heart

43:57.500 --> 43:59.420
and red in claw.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.340
Bennet, no!

44:16.740 --> 44:18.060
Bennet!

44:19.740 --> 44:21.100
It's Edmund.

44:25.100 --> 44:27.090
Bennet!

44:27.100 --> 44:28.370
Jesus!

44:28.380 --> 44:29.900
Drake.

44:31.620 --> 44:33.050
You have anything?

44:33.060 --> 44:34.420
Oh, maybe.

44:36.300 --> 44:37.900
I found this in his gut.

44:39.700 --> 44:40.900
Peyote.

44:42.700 --> 44:46.570
Back home, the Indians use it to
commune with the spirit world.

44:46.580 --> 44:48.730
Sort of a...religious rite.

44:48.740 --> 44:51.410
I've heard of it -
hallucinations, trance states.

44:51.420 --> 44:54.410
Yeah. That would account for the
raptures of Barbecue Bill here.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.050
Hardly a common narcotic on these
streets, though. Where would one
obtain it?

44:57.060 --> 44:58.770
In London? Believe me, I wish
I knew.

44:58.780 --> 45:00.730
It's from a cactus, is it not?

45:00.740 --> 45:04.170
Lophophora williamsii. Cut from the
crown and dried out.

45:04.180 --> 45:07.770
There is an abundance of
horticulturalists and
flower-sellers in this city,

45:07.780 --> 45:09.530
but how many of them do you
suppose

45:09.540 --> 45:12.010
sell exotic cacti
from the American desert?

45:12.020 --> 45:13.620
Flight!

45:45.860 --> 45:49.420
This is my body,
which is broken for you.

46:06.300 --> 46:08.290
If you do not,

46:08.300 --> 46:11.460
I will have Philip break his jaw
and smash out every tooth.

46:21.660 --> 46:25.220
You will wake, and we will be
together.

46:44.780 --> 46:48.290
What lies before
us...take it not for mere play.

46:48.300 --> 46:50.540
Through its array breathe the angels
themselves.

46:52.980 --> 46:54.450
You know them, don't you, Bennet?

46:54.460 --> 46:56.980
Especially your goddess of war.

46:58.620 --> 47:01.690
This form of chess was born
in India,

47:01.700 --> 47:03.490
centuries past.

47:03.500 --> 47:08.050
There is a belief amongst the Hindus
that the world is in its final era.

47:08.060 --> 47:09.530
An age of vice,

47:09.540 --> 47:11.050
degeneracy,

47:11.060 --> 47:12.410
avarice.

47:12.420 --> 47:15.930
But, day by day, the gyres spin
apart - Samhara draws close,

47:15.940 --> 47:18.340
bright dawn devouring every
shadow.

47:27.580 --> 47:30.490
Look not upon her with the name of
another on your lips.

47:30.500 --> 47:31.810
Your Rose.

47:31.820 --> 47:34.090
Of course Bella told me.

47:34.100 --> 47:37.450
I know all of it. Now I shall bring
your Rose to you

47:37.460 --> 47:40.290
and, together,
you can enter the next life.

47:40.300 --> 47:42.490
And you shall enter it on
wings of light

47:42.500 --> 47:47.890
and know at last that you
have come home to a world
stronger and more loving

47:47.900 --> 47:49.420
than any you could dream.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.540
Ooh!

48:07.660 --> 48:09.380
All right, Rose?

48:15.220 --> 48:17.530
Do what you want.

48:17.540 --> 48:19.060
Come on, Rose.

48:31.980 --> 48:33.460
Bennet?

48:34.860 --> 48:36.420
Bennet?

48:37.580 --> 48:38.820
Forgive me.

48:41.340 --> 48:43.020
Forgive me.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.170
It is Rose.

48:47.180 --> 48:48.810
It's your Rose.

48:48.820 --> 48:51.890
Rose.
Shh.

48:51.900 --> 48:54.780
Forgive me.
Shh.

48:55.980 --> 48:59.290
Cummings Horticulture.
Purchase orders for
Lophophora williamsii.

48:59.300 --> 49:01.860
All these orders...the same
address.

49:03.780 --> 49:05.410
I'll get a Maria.

49:05.420 --> 49:07.010
Wait. This...

49:07.020 --> 49:09.810
The same purchase - Atropa
belladonna.

49:09.820 --> 49:12.170
Belladonna? They've bought
nightshade.

49:12.180 --> 49:14.610
That's how they're gonna kill
themselves.

49:14.620 --> 49:16.740
They're gonna drink
goddamn poison.

49:21.100 --> 49:22.570
They brew that up, every single one
of them's dead

49:22.580 --> 49:25.170
within a half-hour.
There's some things I need.

49:25.180 --> 49:26.700
Hurry, man!

49:29.580 --> 49:32.770
"When flowers
will be begot within flowers,

49:32.780 --> 49:34.740
"then will the Yuga come to its
end."

49:54.660 --> 49:58.810
As foretold, the hour of
reckoning is upon us.

49:58.820 --> 50:00.650
Where you ascend to this day,

50:00.660 --> 50:05.780
know that your brothers,
sisters and Father follow.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.730
To take this glittering cup

50:10.740 --> 50:14.220
is to split asunder
the chains of this world.

50:15.940 --> 50:20.410
When my daughter took her brave
steps into the light...

50:20.420 --> 50:22.770
I understood at last

50:22.780 --> 50:25.410
that I was but an instrument
of that light.

50:25.420 --> 50:29.650
It beamed from a world which
called upon all those with faith
and wisdom

50:29.660 --> 50:31.700
to give themselves unto it.

50:45.060 --> 50:48.890
As the butterfly
casts off its husk to soar,

50:48.900 --> 50:52.620
shall you leave forever
this land of the dead.

50:58.020 --> 51:02.130
It is time.
You shall be reunited with
your love.

51:02.140 --> 51:03.330
Where's Bennet?

51:03.340 --> 51:07.690
With his brothers and sisters.
They're so blessed, Rose.

51:07.700 --> 51:10.970
As will you be...tonight.

51:10.980 --> 51:14.780
Gabriel's light will flood
inside of you.

51:32.100 --> 51:33.380
Drake!

51:34.660 --> 51:37.820
Cain! Show yourself!

51:40.820 --> 51:43.450
Cain...
It is as I foretold.

51:43.460 --> 51:45.020
Witness a miracle, sir.

51:46.260 --> 51:48.450
I am saving them.

51:48.460 --> 51:51.380
Behold a simple man
embrace his rapture.

52:04.500 --> 52:07.290
He drank his fill ten minutes ago.

52:07.300 --> 52:08.860
No!

52:16.420 --> 52:18.220
Get her away from him!

52:23.100 --> 52:24.820
Calabar extract for anyone
who drank.

52:28.340 --> 52:30.020
You hold his head to the right.

52:31.540 --> 52:33.610
Open up, Sarge.

52:33.620 --> 52:34.780
Please, no...

52:54.140 --> 52:56.770
Forgive me.
Shh...

52:56.780 --> 52:57.890
Forgive me. I...

52:57.900 --> 52:59.490
I killed you...

52:59.500 --> 53:01.660
I-I killed you all.

53:05.340 --> 53:07.170
He's going to be all right.

53:07.180 --> 53:08.610
Huh?

53:08.620 --> 53:11.130
Ain't that right, friend?

53:11.140 --> 53:12.700
You're gonna be all right.

53:18.980 --> 53:21.980
Sit him down. Sit him down.

53:26.460 --> 53:28.570
Bella! Please!
No, Bennet. No, Bennet...

53:28.580 --> 53:30.490
Please let me see my Bella, please!
Ah!

53:30.500 --> 53:31.890
No, Bella!

53:31.900 --> 53:33.530
I deserve my shackles,
Bennet.

53:33.540 --> 53:36.930
I'll rot in them for what I've
done. Then you can have her.

53:36.940 --> 53:38.010
No, girl.

53:38.020 --> 53:40.730
I know you loved her first.
I've always known.

53:40.740 --> 53:44.130
I tried to be the best I could for
you, but I could never be her,
could I?

53:44.140 --> 53:45.780
It isn't true, Bella, please...

53:46.900 --> 53:49.140
What place for me
in a world without your love?

53:51.980 --> 53:53.140
No!

53:57.100 --> 53:59.690
No, please! Jackson!

53:59.700 --> 54:01.140
Please...!

54:06.020 --> 54:07.660
Please...

54:47.100 --> 54:51.010
Whitechapel's carpenters and builders
lend their skill at no cost.

54:51.020 --> 54:53.290
Jew, Gentile, Irish, English.

54:53.300 --> 54:55.500
I hear the same is true of
the churches.

54:56.980 --> 54:59.210
A man might, in his softer moments,

54:59.220 --> 55:03.050
have to concede something
to your creed of progress.

55:03.060 --> 55:08.170
I daily witness that which would
cause any sane man to deny

55:08.180 --> 55:10.250
the very notion of good...

55:10.260 --> 55:11.660
in God or in Man.

55:13.340 --> 55:16.260
And there are times when I have
thought to do so myself.

55:18.020 --> 55:23.890
When I saw my...daughter
vanish in flame and darkness,

55:23.900 --> 55:28.130
that day the dwindling spectre
of a God vanished too.

55:28.140 --> 55:30.130
But I cannot - I will not -

55:30.140 --> 55:34.210
believe that...Man...

55:34.220 --> 55:36.940
that we are not...

55:41.820 --> 55:44.900
We are caged by what is, you said.

55:46.220 --> 55:49.420
But to see no further than the
bars...

55:52.180 --> 55:54.500
..that is a terror I could not
endure.

55:57.140 --> 56:01.300
Tomorrow may be a brighter place.

56:03.180 --> 56:06.380
Perhaps those who believe it
are the fortunate ones.

56:07.620 --> 56:09.420
For a man without faith...

56:10.580 --> 56:12.660
..is a man without hope.

57:17.380 --> 57:18.740
Bennet.

57:26.140 --> 57:27.740
Bennet, I...

57:28.900 --> 57:31.410
If you...

57:31.420 --> 57:33.940
If you've ever need of a
friend...

57:35.580 --> 57:37.620
Take your hand from me, girl.

57:40.940 --> 57:43.020
I am made of nought but death.

58:02.540 --> 58:03.620
Bennet?

58:05.780 --> 58:07.490
Still hunting
for your beau, are ya?

58:07.500 --> 58:08.570
I've got a picture now.

58:08.580 --> 58:09.650
Have you seen him?
I've seen him.

58:09.660 --> 58:12.530
Where, Gracie?
Nowhere you wanna go, girl.

58:12.540 --> 58:15.250
You are a sight for a weary man.

58:15.260 --> 58:17.700
I thought you were dead,
you son of a bitch!

58:20.140 --> 58:22.370
My house is no longer my own.

58:22.380 --> 58:25.340
How many blows will it take
to fell this man?

58:26.305 --> 58:32.230
