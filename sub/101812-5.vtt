12:57.515 --> 13:00.867
What are the, uh, significant
events, dates in his life?

13:00.910 --> 13:03.217
The last time
the Cowboys won the Super Bowl?

13:03.260 --> 13:04.392
The first day
he saw Star Wars.

13:04.435 --> 13:05.785
No, no, no. Die Hard.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.047
Bruce Willis's birthday.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.875
Bingo.
Bingo.MacGYVER: Jack would have

13:08.918 --> 13:11.007
also known that I can get in
without the combination.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.493
MacGYVER:
Your average wall safe is made
of a titanium alloy

13:18.536 --> 13:21.365
that'll withstand direct force
and intense heat.

13:21.409 --> 13:24.238
But the subzero cold of Freon

13:24.281 --> 13:26.022
will crack the tumblers
in no time.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.546
Sorry if this costs you
a good night's sleep.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.943
BOZER:
It's empty?

13:33.987 --> 13:35.902
No. There's something here.
A picture.

13:40.471 --> 13:41.995
Well, this isn't Tiberius Kovac.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.257
Can anyone put a name

13:43.300 --> 13:44.911
to the face?

13:45.912 --> 13:47.609
[beep, click]

13:52.048 --> 13:54.050
All right, this might
take a minute.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.225
[beeping]

13:55.269 --> 13:56.400
[computer chirps]

13:56.444 --> 13:57.924
Or not.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.536
Tibor Babic.
Medium-level local smuggler.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.581
Any connection
to Jack or Kovac?

14:03.625 --> 14:05.366
Not on his criminal file.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.628
Matilda?

14:06.671 --> 14:07.934
Are you getting all this?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.327
I am. I'll circle back
with U.S. Intelligence,

14:10.371 --> 14:11.633
as well as Ray Walker,

14:11.676 --> 14:12.677
see if there's
any further intel.

14:12.721 --> 14:13.722
Good.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.115
Jack wanted this
guy on our radar.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.768
Now, how do we find him?

14:16.812 --> 14:19.423
Hands! Hands!

14:19.467 --> 14:21.121
Uh, Des, relax.
They're Interpol.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.253
Oh. Very observant.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.385
TAYLOR:
Why the, uh...

14:24.428 --> 14:26.082
the warm welcome, Agent...?

14:26.126 --> 14:27.388
Anya Vitez.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.476
Head of Interpol's

14:28.519 --> 14:29.869
anti-terror unit.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.435
Do you introduce yourself
to everybody this way?

14:31.479 --> 14:33.611
No, but when the notorious

14:33.655 --> 14:35.483
Russ Taylor
comes to Croatia,

14:35.526 --> 14:37.920
and... his motives...

14:37.964 --> 14:41.402
are not... clear...

14:41.445 --> 14:44.448
I wonder what he's doing
on my turf.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.102
Well, that, my newfound friend,

14:46.146 --> 14:48.670
is a very interesting story.

14:54.806 --> 14:57.113
And you think
Dalton leaving you this picture

14:57.157 --> 14:59.420
of Tibor Babic
is somehow connected

14:59.463 --> 15:01.813
to the dead terrorist Kovac?

15:01.857 --> 15:03.119
Well, we haven't been
on the ground long enough

15:03.163 --> 15:04.555
to know where the trail leads.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.949
So, Agent Vitez,

15:06.993 --> 15:09.212
we'll be on our way, and, um,

15:09.256 --> 15:10.779
we'll keep you updated.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.607
Slow down. I think you...

15:12.650 --> 15:14.435
hold out because...

15:14.478 --> 15:15.697
you do not trust me.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.525
We don't know you.

15:19.570 --> 15:23.357
I, um... I got to know
Jack a bit over the last year.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.228
BOZER:
In a good way?
'Cause with Jack,

15:25.272 --> 15:27.404
sometimes it took a while
to appreciate his...

15:28.449 --> 15:29.885
Jackness.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.061
[chuckles]
We called him

15:32.105 --> 15:33.497
"cuvar stada."

15:33.541 --> 15:34.977
Cowboy?Yeah.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.283
And more.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.894
Keeper of the flock, protector.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.158
You were once his flock,
too, yeah?

15:42.202 --> 15:43.420
RILEY:
Family.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.335
We were his family.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.729
And I can help you
if you will let me.

15:47.772 --> 15:50.645
I know where
to find this smuggler.

15:50.688 --> 15:53.300
So, I'll come with you.

15:53.343 --> 15:54.562
I owe it to Jack.

16:13.189 --> 16:16.323
What kind of restaurant
serves Fitbits on the side?

16:16.366 --> 16:19.152
Yeah, this place must be a front
for Tibor's smuggling operation.

16:24.331 --> 16:25.636
He's here.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.987
[metallic thud]I got him!

16:46.570 --> 16:48.398
[grunting]

16:48.442 --> 16:50.487
[groans]Stick around, Tibor.

16:50.531 --> 16:51.488
We got some questions.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.273
[groans]

16:55.449 --> 16:57.190
You never heard of Jack Dalton?

16:58.800 --> 17:01.324
How about Ozzie Ulrich?

17:01.368 --> 17:03.413
My business is customer service.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.763
[laughing]:
It's my nature to help.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.939
But I cannot tell you

17:07.983 --> 17:09.680
what I do not know.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.335
Ah.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.467
Thank you.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.512
Running made me
thirsty, huh?

17:16.687 --> 17:17.949
[gasps]

17:17.993 --> 17:19.690
[groans]

17:20.735 --> 17:24.260
That's a '99 Frankovka.

17:24.304 --> 17:25.783
$400 a bottle!

17:25.827 --> 17:27.524
You know, this stash house--

17:27.568 --> 17:31.093
you have lots of very, very
expensive, beautiful items.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.529
Oh, no.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.662
We are seriously in the mood
to break things!

17:34.705 --> 17:37.273
No, no!
[groans]

17:37.317 --> 17:39.797
I swear on the lives
of my children,

17:39.841 --> 17:41.321
I did not know this Dalton man!

17:41.364 --> 17:43.062
You are on foreign soil.

17:43.105 --> 17:47.022
The tools at your disposal
are limited.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.110
Perhaps I can take this man

17:48.154 --> 17:50.112
somewhere where
I can question him

17:50.156 --> 17:52.723
with more...
enhanced methods.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.638
Agent Vitez, before we do that,
would you mind

17:54.682 --> 17:56.031
giving him one
last chance?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.642
I think I can build
a rudimentary lie detector.

17:58.686 --> 17:59.991
You can?Yeah.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.124
It's all about measuring
blood pressure, heart rate

18:02.168 --> 18:04.909
and breathing, and all three
of those things are in this

18:04.953 --> 18:06.302
tiny little watch.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.087
Is your name "MacGyver"?

18:09.175 --> 18:10.524
How do you know that?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.656
[laughs]

18:12.700 --> 18:14.658
Hey, man.
[grunts]

18:14.702 --> 18:17.444
Jack Dalton and I were BFFs!

18:17.487 --> 18:19.924
Really? Because you just swore
on the lives of your children

18:19.968 --> 18:21.361
that you didn't know the man.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.536
I have no children.

18:22.579 --> 18:23.798
Hey, Jack talked about you

18:23.841 --> 18:25.539
all the time, man.
You're the one

18:25.582 --> 18:27.323
that makes things
out of other things?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.847
Obviously.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.371
What else you got?

18:31.414 --> 18:36.158
Jack wanted me to send over
five cases of cell phone

18:36.202 --> 18:37.333
as joke.

18:37.377 --> 18:38.682
I'm starting to believe.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.641
Okay, Tibor.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.425
Why did Jack want us
to find you?

18:42.469 --> 18:46.168
Well, you did conspire
to take down Tiberius Kovac.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.041
You and Jack
working together?

18:50.085 --> 18:51.739
Yeah, he came to me because

18:51.782 --> 18:54.307
I've done a little business
with Kovac. You know how it is.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.179
Are you admitting to selling
stolen goods to a terrorist?

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
Hey, you wanted honesty.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.313
Don't punish me for it.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.228
[scoffs]
Understand.

19:02.271 --> 19:04.099
I've never met
Kovac face-to-face.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.666
We use cut-outs,
dead drops.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.408
I didn't even know it was
him in the beginning.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.367
But then, when I realized
whose money I was taking,

19:11.411 --> 19:13.717
I knew I was trapped.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.023
RILEY:
What kind of conspiring

19:15.066 --> 19:17.199
against Kovac did
you and Jack do?

19:17.243 --> 19:19.549
We planted a bug in a shipment
of radio equipment

19:19.593 --> 19:21.072
that I sold to Kovac.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.596
That's how
Jack found the compound.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.556
"Please," Jack said,
"Help me take

19:26.600 --> 19:28.602
"this awful man down,
and I will wipe

19:28.645 --> 19:29.907
your slate clean."

19:29.951 --> 19:31.387
But now Jack is dead,

19:31.431 --> 19:34.434
and Kovac may soon
kill me, too.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.612
Why... why would you say that?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.353
Kovac blew himself up
in the raid.

19:40.396 --> 19:41.571
Yeah, that's what I thought.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.269
But dead men don't need
high credit scores

19:43.312 --> 19:45.227
and clean driving records.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.968
Kovac reached
out to me.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.275
He wanted papers and passport
for new identities.

19:49.318 --> 19:52.234
If I say no, he gets mad, and
[blows raspberry] he kills me.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.931
If I say yes, he takes
the paper and...

19:53.975 --> 19:56.107
[blows raspberry] kills me
to keep his secret safe.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.240
The raid was a setup.BOZER: Kovac faked his death

19:58.284 --> 19:59.633
so the law would
stop looking for him.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.374
And the bastard who killed Jack
is still alive.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.208
Okay, guys,
the hunt for Tiberius Kovac

20:09.251 --> 20:11.384
is now an active op,
and we are running point.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.734
How did the ground team at
Kovac's compound miss this?

20:13.777 --> 20:15.866
Undetermined.
And in the aftermath,

20:15.910 --> 20:18.260
there were all the usual
conspiracy theories

20:18.304 --> 20:20.436
that he was still alive,
just like bin Laden,

20:20.480 --> 20:22.177
but now with Tibor's
information,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.787
we have to assume
the rumors are true

20:23.831 --> 20:25.572
and act like the world's
most deadly terrorist

20:25.615 --> 20:27.095
is on the loose.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.401
Which means Jack died for...

20:28.444 --> 20:29.619
MacGYVER:
No, don't say it.

20:29.663 --> 20:30.707
What it means is that we need

20:30.751 --> 20:32.883
to finish his mission.
That's all.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.495
I'll keep digging on my end.
Keep me posted.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.192
Here's what's bugging me.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.846
Why didn't Jack share the intel
with his unit?

20:38.889 --> 20:41.501
Right? He didn't tell Walker
about his connection to Tibor

20:41.544 --> 20:43.372
or how he used a smuggler
to locate Kovac's compound.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.331
Operational security.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.897
He must have figured
that there was a leak.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.856
In the wilderness of mirrors,
Jack didn't know who to trust.

20:48.899 --> 20:51.075
Hence the backup plan
to alert Mac.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.164
Which makes me wonder just
how much we can trust Tibor.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.644
BOZER:
How about zero?

20:54.688 --> 20:56.864
Zilch, zip, nada.
That kind of guy's

20:56.907 --> 20:58.213
always gonna play both sides.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.823
For all we know, he set Jack up.

20:59.867 --> 21:01.129
MacGYVER:
All true.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.348
But that doesn't mean
he can't be useful.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.784
I say we have

21:03.827 --> 21:05.264
Tibor demand a face-to-face
meeting with Kovac

21:05.307 --> 21:06.787
to exchange cash

21:06.830 --> 21:08.484
for the passports
that Kovac wanted.

21:08.528 --> 21:09.964
DESI:
Won't Kovac just seize

21:10.007 --> 21:11.792
that meeting to ambush
and kill Tibor?

21:11.835 --> 21:13.359
That's exactly what
I'm counting on.

21:23.412 --> 21:24.761
[engine turns off]

21:27.547 --> 21:29.505
Sitting Duck One
in position.

21:29.549 --> 21:32.203
MacGYVER:
Not sure how I feel
about that code name.

21:32.247 --> 21:35.206
Stand where I am,
and you can pick your own.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.991
All right, everyone,
just breathe.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.819
Riley, Bozer,

21:38.862 --> 21:41.343
how does it look
from the crow's nest?Vehicle approaching.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.216
RILEY:
Tibor's blind date just arrived.

21:50.961 --> 21:54.704
Windows are tinted. I can't get
a read on who's inside.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.837
Well, it could be Kovac,
or it could be a death squad.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.360
If it's the latter,

21:58.404 --> 22:00.188
we need to take a prisoner
to get a lead

22:00.231 --> 22:01.537
on Kovac.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.106
What is taking them so long?

22:05.149 --> 22:06.455
I'm gonna get a closer look.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.420
I don't see a driver.

22:14.463 --> 22:15.943
What, the car just drove itself?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.118
Get down!

22:18.380 --> 22:20.077
[all grunting]

22:23.820 --> 22:25.822
Two SUVs inbound from the east.

22:27.650 --> 22:29.348
[tires screech]

22:35.702 --> 22:37.878
[grunts]

22:43.405 --> 22:45.015
[whirring]

23:13.957 --> 23:16.003
We need to take
one of them alive.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.136
[grunts]

23:24.881 --> 23:27.057
[tires squealing]

23:39.983 --> 23:41.985
[groaning]

23:44.988 --> 23:46.816

23:47.861 --> 23:48.949
Sit.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.387
[mutters]

23:53.432 --> 23:55.477
Thanks for the safe house.

23:55.521 --> 23:56.957
Yeah, of course.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.524
I just hope this
man can help

23:58.567 --> 24:00.003
lead us to Kovac.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.353
It'll be better
for him if he does.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.661
So, how do we get
to America, huh?

24:07.228 --> 24:08.795
Military plane or we, uh...

24:08.838 --> 24:11.275
fly private?
[clicks tongue]

24:11.319 --> 24:13.060
What makes you think
you're coming home with us?

24:13.103 --> 24:14.365
That was not the deal.

24:14.409 --> 24:15.541
My business is finished.

24:16.585 --> 24:17.543
I am finished.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.109
Not our problem.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.594
MacGyver. Mac.

24:25.638 --> 24:28.684
Hey, you must honor
Jack's promise, huh?

24:28.728 --> 24:31.078
If you help us find Kovac,
you have nothing to worry about.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.645
Well, that's a big if.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.604
You know, considering the man
has so much trouble dying.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.782
Okay.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.828
You leave me no choice

24:41.871 --> 24:44.613
but to use the ace in my hole.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.136
That is not how that goes.

24:46.963 --> 24:47.964
TAYLOR:
So, you've been

24:48.008 --> 24:49.531
holding out on us?Only a little.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.838
There's one more thing that Jack
asked me to tell MacGyver,

24:51.881 --> 24:54.014
and I've been saving it for just

24:54.057 --> 24:55.276
this occasion.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.845
Intel isn't a fine wine.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.934
It doesn't get
better with age.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.936
Do I get ticket
to America?

25:02.979 --> 25:04.503
Information first.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.595
Jack said to remind you

25:09.638 --> 25:11.945
of your manniversary.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.557
Manniversary?BOZER:
It was this thing

25:15.601 --> 25:18.299
Jack made up
for him and Mac to...

25:18.342 --> 25:20.388
We'll talk later.MacGYVER:
I don't get the reference.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.346
I mean, the last one
didn't go so well.

25:22.390 --> 25:25.132
I don't know. He said
you went to hotel in Vegas

25:25.175 --> 25:27.613
with that giant aquarium
and the,

25:27.656 --> 25:29.223
uh...

25:29.266 --> 25:30.572
What do you call, uh...

25:30.616 --> 25:31.965
Uh, talking dummy!

25:32.008 --> 25:33.662
Yeah, I remember the fish tank

25:33.706 --> 25:36.535
that Jack thought
had piranhas in it,

25:36.578 --> 25:38.319
and I'll never forget
the ventriloquist act

25:38.362 --> 25:39.886
he made me sit through-- twice.

25:39.929 --> 25:43.237
What could this
possibly have to do with Kovac?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.586
Jack was many things.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.283
Sophisticated was not

25:46.327 --> 25:47.371
one of them.Yeah.

25:47.415 --> 25:48.634
Right about that.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.334
Wait, you're right.

25:53.377 --> 25:56.250
At face value,
he's reminding me of The Mirage.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.686
Riley, can you
cross-reference all of

25:57.730 --> 26:00.297
the info we have on Kovac
with physical location?

26:00.341 --> 26:02.212
See if there's a pattern.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.649
RILEY:
No.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.781
Every piece of data leads to

26:05.825 --> 26:07.522
a digital dead end
with no real-world connection.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.568
Even the photo
we have of Kovac--

26:09.611 --> 26:11.047
it matches a
stock photo

26:11.091 --> 26:12.614
from a defunct website.

26:12.658 --> 26:13.702
How can that be possible?

26:13.746 --> 26:15.486
Because Kovac
is a mirage.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.141
Uh, I am confused.

26:18.185 --> 26:19.708
I think what Jack suspected,

26:19.752 --> 26:21.101
what he's been trying
to lead us to,

26:21.144 --> 26:22.798
is that Kovac isn't
a real person.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.321
Okay, I'm not following.

26:24.365 --> 26:26.149
Someone had to commit
those acts of terror.

26:26.193 --> 26:27.977
Well, sure. But the Kovac
that appears on TV,

26:28.021 --> 26:29.413
it's just an
online persona

26:29.457 --> 26:31.154
used to hide
from law enforcement.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.329
So there's no Kovac?

26:32.373 --> 26:33.940
He's like the Wizard of Oz.
Someone's

26:33.983 --> 26:35.419
behind the curtain.MacGYVER:
It would explain

26:35.463 --> 26:36.595
how this terrorist was able

26:36.638 --> 26:38.335
to evade Jack and his unit
for so long.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.163
So, how do we catch
Jack's killer

26:40.207 --> 26:42.383
when we're chasing
someone that doesn't exist?

26:51.218 --> 26:52.393
I-I don't like small places.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.830
Then you're gonna love this.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.354
Okay, if Jack suspected a leak,
he would've been close

26:57.398 --> 26:59.052
to figuring out
who was behind Oz's curtain,

26:59.095 --> 27:01.097
even if he didn't know
who exactly it was.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.621
Well, let's hope
our unconscious guest

27:02.664 --> 27:03.926
has answers.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.885
He's been asleep long enough.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.543
You're gonna tell me
everything you know

27:12.587 --> 27:13.849
about Tiberius Kovac.

27:14.894 --> 27:17.026
[grunts, groans][gunshot]

27:17.070 --> 27:18.419
TAYLOR:
Sniper. Get down.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.424
[sighs] He's dead.
We just lost our only lead.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.382
DESI:
Then we need to get the shooter.

27:25.426 --> 27:28.690
How can we do that? He could be
half a mile away from here.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.301
Jack was a sniper.
He taught me everything he knew.

27:31.345 --> 27:32.651
A bullet's trajectory
is determined

27:32.694 --> 27:34.565
by muzzle velocity and gravity.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.306
And by using
correlated triangles,

27:36.350 --> 27:38.439
and then factoring in
drop correction,

27:38.482 --> 27:40.397
well, geometry
makes it hard to hide.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.704
Six floors up,
three blocks away!

27:45.098 --> 27:46.273
[speaking Croatian]

27:47.317 --> 27:49.493
What is all this commotion?

27:49.537 --> 27:51.713
Okay, so this safe house
is not so safe anymore.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.716
My guys are coming.Hey, hey, hey, take me with you!

27:54.760 --> 27:57.414
I'm not leaving yet.What? Why not?

27:57.458 --> 27:59.286
This seems like
a great time to go.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.504
Just because he can't talk

28:00.548 --> 28:01.723
doesn't mean
he can't tell us something.

28:01.767 --> 28:02.985
If you stay,
I can't protect you.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.422
Bozer, can you get me
a piece of paper?

28:05.466 --> 28:06.641
Yeah.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.041
Thanks.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.481
[groans]

28:22.309 --> 28:23.571
[groans]

28:23.614 --> 28:24.877
[camera beeps, clicks]

28:24.920 --> 28:26.443
All right.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.532
I'll start with local databases.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.578
Let's see where
an I.D. leads us.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.108
That's where the sniper
set up his hide.

28:39.152 --> 28:41.023
He's got to be
on the run by now.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.677
TAYLOR:
That's our shooter.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.986
Or a decoy.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.336
[gasps]

28:49.379 --> 28:50.641
It's okay.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.948
It's okay. Her fear is real.
The shooter just put

28:52.992 --> 28:53.993
his rifle in her cart.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.041
There he is.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.842
I'll check out the alley.Okay.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.034
[grunting]

29:54.575 --> 29:56.490
Nice of you to show up.

30:02.757 --> 30:05.064
[sighs] No wallet.
No cell phone. Nothing.

30:05.107 --> 30:07.980
Back to square one.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.156
This is an Argus.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.679
Croatian made.

30:11.722 --> 30:13.681
It's a favorite
of the Croatian Special Forces.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.552
Well, if he's
special forces

30:15.596 --> 30:16.902
turned mercenary for Kovac,

30:16.945 --> 30:18.817
he'll have been scrubbed
from all the usual databases

30:18.860 --> 30:20.601
but not from their
special ops file.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.213
Riley.

30:24.257 --> 30:27.086
Enhance this retina

30:27.129 --> 30:29.218
from this pic I'm sending you.

30:29.262 --> 30:31.351
See if there's any matches
in the Croatian military.

30:31.394 --> 30:32.874
I'm on it.

30:33.919 --> 30:35.529
BOZER:
The gunman we grabbed earlier

30:35.572 --> 30:37.009
is named Josip Gergic.

30:37.052 --> 30:37.923
Bosnian Mafia.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.272
Get this.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.622
He's also listed
as a confidential informant

30:41.665 --> 30:43.363
for Interpol's anti-terror unit.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.539
BOZER:
Got a hit on your shooter.

30:45.582 --> 30:46.714
He's active military.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.063
Currently assigned
to the same unit.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.065
Vitez runs that group.
She knows these two men.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.372
She knew all of Jack's plans.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.461
[gun clicks]

30:56.942 --> 30:58.247
You're Kovac.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.597
Yeah. And you people

31:00.641 --> 31:02.382
are too damn curious.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.907
Riley, Bozer, buy time.
We're on our way!

31:05.951 --> 31:08.388
Let's go. Both of you.

31:08.431 --> 31:09.693
We're not going
anywhere.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.434
Then I will shoot you
where you stand.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.045
You'll have to go
through me first.

31:13.088 --> 31:14.481
Fine.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.570
[grunting]

31:17.701 --> 31:19.834
You understand
who's in control now?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.227
Because the next bullet

31:21.270 --> 31:22.837
will not be so merciful.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.459
RILEY:
Your secret's out, Vitez.

31:36.503 --> 31:37.896
There's nowhere
for you to run.

31:37.939 --> 31:41.160
Running is not what
I had in mind.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.205
[tires squeal]

31:44.946 --> 31:47.253
Guys, I can't reach Riley
and Bozer on comms,

31:47.296 --> 31:49.516
and there's no signal
for their cell phones, either.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.648
DESI:
This isn't good.

31:51.692 --> 31:53.955
Okay. Based on the, uh,
volume of blood

31:53.999 --> 31:55.826
and the spray pattern,
it's a single shot.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.306
TAYLOR:
Looks like someone's hurt

31:57.350 --> 31:58.699
but hopefully not dead.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.570
Yet.Matty,

32:00.614 --> 32:02.790
Vitez has them.

32:02.833 --> 32:05.619
Ma'am? Riley's comms
just went active.

32:05.662 --> 32:06.750
We can track the signal.

32:06.794 --> 32:10.145
Attagirl, Riley.
Way to send up a flare.

32:10.189 --> 32:12.756
Mac, I'm sending you coordinates
for their location.

32:16.021 --> 32:19.328
BOZER:
Won't be long before
our people come get us.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.330
I'm inviting them.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.332
But until they arrive,

32:23.376 --> 32:26.422
let's make good use
of our time. [grunts]

32:30.035 --> 32:32.515
Enter the passcode to
your laptop, please.

32:33.560 --> 32:34.953
Why?

32:34.996 --> 32:36.519
Because I asked nicely.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.478
Or because the next bullet
I put in your friend

32:38.521 --> 32:40.219
will be into his head.

32:40.262 --> 32:42.047
Don't do it, Riley.
She's bluffing.

32:43.613 --> 32:44.788
No.

32:44.832 --> 32:46.486
She's not.

32:48.053 --> 32:51.360
She's covering her tracks
and hanging us out to dry.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.579
Very good.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.884
You see,

32:53.928 --> 32:56.626
Kovac was only an
anarchist in name.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.673
This is a cash-for-chaos
operation.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.545
Kovac destroys;
I get paid.

33:02.589 --> 33:05.026
A terrorist without an ideology?

33:05.070 --> 33:06.723
No, I believe in money.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.464
My clients are
corporations,

33:08.508 --> 33:11.554
governments, billionaires
with political agendas.

33:11.598 --> 33:14.035
I'm a useful tool
for those in power.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.559
And you think you can just
bury Kovac and start up again?

33:16.603 --> 33:18.779
Well, it's only your
word against mine

33:18.822 --> 33:20.563
that I am Kovac,

33:20.607 --> 33:22.957
and when the dust has settled...

33:23.001 --> 33:25.220
people will believe my story.[tapping keyboard]

33:25.264 --> 33:28.832
What story?Well, how I found the
money trail from Kovac

33:28.876 --> 33:31.052
that leads straight
to Jack Dalton.

33:31.096 --> 33:33.402
No one's ever gonna believe
Jack Dalton was a traitor.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.752
In these times, stories
of corrupt Americans

33:35.796 --> 33:37.841
are all too common.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.975
Especially when it comes
out that the mercenary

33:41.019 --> 33:44.413
and his think tank
colleagues died

33:44.457 --> 33:46.937
trying to cover up
Dalton's crimes.

33:46.981 --> 33:48.417
[computer beeps]

33:48.461 --> 33:51.246
What a tragic tale.

33:52.639 --> 33:56.904
You know, just before that
last raid in the compound,

33:56.947 --> 34:00.081
Jack told me how he
couldn't wait to get home,

34:00.125 --> 34:04.259
because more than
anything, he needed

34:04.303 --> 34:07.697
a decent slice of
greasy pizza...

34:07.741 --> 34:09.699
with you.

34:16.184 --> 34:18.143
All right, Matty, we're
outside of the building.

34:18.186 --> 34:19.492
It's under construction.

34:19.535 --> 34:21.102
Is there anything
on the satellite?

34:21.146 --> 34:22.582
The building's vacant,
with the exception

34:22.625 --> 34:25.280
of five heat signatures
on the 15th floor.

34:25.324 --> 34:28.283
We've accessed a security cam
from across the street.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.111
Bozer and Riley
are being used as shields

34:30.155 --> 34:31.721
against a direct assault.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.636
