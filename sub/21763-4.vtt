The island engulfed in waves,
sinking under them.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.930
-Lemurs in the water. Sinking.
-[whimpering]

00:56.014 --> 00:58.141
A terrible sinking.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.976
The island of Madagascar is sinking?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.103
When, Masikura?
When is this going to happen?

01:02.687 --> 01:05.148
In the future.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.109
Could you be a just a
little more specific?

01:08.193 --> 01:09.778
I mean, just a skosh?

01:09.861 --> 01:12.322
Tomorrow morning at sunrise.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.948
Okay, a little too specific.

01:14.032 --> 01:18.036
[Julien] I've asked you all here
for some very important business.

01:18.119 --> 01:19.079
[clears throat]

01:19.162 --> 01:21.331
Shouldn't we be meeting in the war room?

01:21.414 --> 01:24.209
That's just what they'd
be expecting us to do, Clover.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.837
Uh-huh, and who is "they",
Your Majesty? Just wondering.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.382
Exactly. Besides,
the bubbles help me think. Mort.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.467
[gasps]

01:32.926 --> 01:34.135
Yes, my king?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.303
Bubbles are getting low.

01:35.386 --> 01:36.679
More bubbles.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.389
[inhales deeply]

01:38.973 --> 01:41.601
King Julien, if the island is sinking,
what should we do?

01:41.684 --> 01:46.105
I'm thinking, Maurice. Uh...
Mort. More bubbles.

01:46.189 --> 01:50.110
Yay! My colon is helping
King Julien think.

01:50.193 --> 01:53.780
My thinky bits say...
that we should tell the kingdom.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.615
Good idea, Your Majesty.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.617
But it needs to be done carefully.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.993
We don't want to cause a panic.

01:59.077 --> 02:00.703
Please, Maurice,

02:00.787 --> 02:03.206
I didn't just put on the crown
yesterday, you know.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.249
[gasps]

02:04.332 --> 02:06.167
Yeah, Maurice, duh!

02:06.251 --> 02:08.211
I know how to handle situations like this.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.963
You're gonna make me tell them.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.965
You read my mind, Mo-Mo.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.800
You got this, Maurice.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.135
We're all gonna die!

02:15.218 --> 02:17.679
The island's sinking
and we're all gonna die.

02:17.762 --> 02:20.223
Panic. Mayhem. [screams] No!

02:20.306 --> 02:22.142
[all screaming]

02:22.225 --> 02:24.227
My bad. He doesn't got this.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.563
Peoples, peoples, calm down.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.774
Yes, the island is sinking,
but we've got like a whole day

02:29.858 --> 02:31.484
to figure out how to save ourselves.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.652
We can totally do it.

02:32.735 --> 02:33.778
We can?

02:33.862 --> 02:36.614
You bet, Willie.
We can do anything. Anything.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.491
[all cheering]

02:38.575 --> 02:41.161
In case this all goes south,
and it probably will,

02:41.244 --> 02:43.413
we're gonna need to find a new island.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.082
Better pack my essentials.
Creams, powders, lotions,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.792
ointments, and my neck pillow.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.461
Most Importantly,
I will need Captain Booty-Butt.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.504
You know how I can't sleep

02:51.588 --> 02:52.589
in a new place without him.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.090
I mean I can't set up a new kingdom

02:54.173 --> 02:55.550
with tired bags under the royal eyes.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.509
Know what I'm sayin?

02:56.593 --> 02:58.511
Um, Captain Booty-Butt?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.388
It's King Julien's favorite plushy toy

03:00.471 --> 03:02.390
from when he was a baby. Stuffed hippo.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.558
[chuckles sheepishly]

03:03.641 --> 03:04.475
Uh...

03:06.769 --> 03:08.187
We gotta lighten up this island.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.189
We are too fat, peoples.

03:10.273 --> 03:15.194
Time to shake those moneymakers
and sweat off those pounds.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.489
Oh, yeah, working like a beast
to get that body.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.532
[yelling enthusiastically]

03:19.616 --> 03:20.950
I gotta go to work.

03:22.785 --> 03:23.661
Hmm?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.247
[Julien] Let the pounds melt away.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.082
Push out that sweat, peoples.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.084
[Brodney] All the heat and steam

03:30.168 --> 03:34.422
is making me [shouts] sticky
and [groans] uncomfortable.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.174
Brodney, no. No, Brodney!

03:36.257 --> 03:38.051
-[Brodney screams]
-[farts]

03:38.134 --> 03:41.638
[lemur 1] Gah. Now the smell
is just cooking in this heat.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.974
[lemur 2] I can taste stinky musk bits
on my tongue.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.768
Okay, new plan.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.519
What's the heaviest thing on this island?

03:48.603 --> 03:51.856
Spoiler alert. It's all the trees.
[laughs]

03:53.483 --> 03:55.276
[people shrieking in fear]

03:59.113 --> 04:00.698
Captain Booty-Butt. Sure.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.075
Captain Booty-Butt. [chuckles nervously]

04:02.158 --> 04:03.826
[cries]

04:03.910 --> 04:04.786
What's wrong?

04:04.869 --> 04:06.663
I didn't have the heart
to tell King Julien,

04:06.746 --> 04:10.166
but Captain Booty-Butt,
He was stolen years ago.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.336
[exclaims frustratedly] Well,
you know King Julien. Crazy or not,

04:13.419 --> 04:15.546
there's no way he's leaving here
without that thing.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.423
And I am not letting my king

04:17.507 --> 04:19.342
stay on a sinking island. You got me?

04:19.425 --> 04:21.886
So we are gonna find
that plushy, what what?

04:21.970 --> 04:27.308
[crying] But how? It's gone. Gone!

04:27.392 --> 04:29.018
Get a hold of yourself, soldier.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.396
Trust me. This is what I do.

04:31.479 --> 04:33.064
[sniffles] Okay. [grunts]

04:33.147 --> 04:34.274
And no blubbering.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.193
-Masikura!
-[screams]

04:37.277 --> 04:39.404
Has anything we've done made a difference?

04:39.487 --> 04:41.489
Is the island still sinking?

04:44.409 --> 04:45.952
Nope. Sorry. Same as before.

04:46.035 --> 04:49.330
Tomorrow at sunrise,
the island is engulfed in waves.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.873
Lemurs in the water.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.751
Sinking. A terrible sinking.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.794
[exclaims in frustration]

04:56.421 --> 04:58.756
That Captain Booty-Butt
plushy was right here

04:58.840 --> 05:00.883
with all his stuff from
when he was a baby.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.012
Oh, look at his wittle baby bottle.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.763
He was so cute--

05:05.847 --> 05:06.889
What the heck was that for?

05:06.973 --> 05:08.725
Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Maurice.

05:08.808 --> 05:11.227
Thought you were going to
get all blubbery again. [laughs]

05:12.061 --> 05:12.979
Wait a minute.

05:14.605 --> 05:17.233
These footprints must be years old

05:17.317 --> 05:20.653
and can only belong to
one tiny, evil cockroach.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.032
Ha! Looks like this cold case
just got a whole lot warmer.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.493
All right, peoples, the Sky Gods
have left us no choice.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.830
We must sacrifice someone
to Judy the Goddess of Seafood

05:30.913 --> 05:33.916
so she won't swallow up the island
in all her wavy bits.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.335
Volunteers?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.045
Hector? How about you, buddy?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.964
You're like really old,
so it shouldn't matter so much, right?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.467
Yep, I'll do it... if it'll spare me

05:42.550 --> 05:44.594
one more minute with you losers.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.763
That's the spirit, Hector.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.848
Move your saggy tush, Hector.

05:48.931 --> 05:52.185
If anybody's gonna be a sacrifice
around here, it's me.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.521
I'm first on the sacrifice list, remember?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.440
Read it and weep, gramps.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.692
You're older than I am, Mort.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.696
Take me, my king. I'm yours.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.364
[chuckles smugly]

06:05.448 --> 06:07.784
Stop squirming, Mort. This is serious.

06:07.867 --> 06:11.245
[laughs] Sorry. Serious face.
Very serious.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.207
Judy, Water Goddess of Seafood,

06:14.290 --> 06:18.419
I give you this sacrificial, uh, Mort.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.046
Here ya go. Enjoy.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.255

-Whee!

06:42.527 --> 06:45.071
Aah... Whee!

06:46.572 --> 06:49.200
[sighs] I think he's gone.
For reals this time.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.952
I thought he'd never leave.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.787
-Mort!
-Whee!

06:55.081 --> 06:56.666
Judy doesn't want Mort.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.751
Mort's not being a team player.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.337
Just let Judy eat you already, Mort.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.465
Sorry, everybody, but I'm really floaty.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.468
Swapped out a lot of my parts
for wood years ago.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.096
Why didn't I think of this before?

07:10.346 --> 07:13.057
We can all float off this island.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.351
Okay everybody, on Mort.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.526
I feel like it's not working.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.363
Okay, Maurice, follow my every step.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.789
Shark pit. Nice.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.171
Impressive work, Clover.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.797
Easy-peasy, Maur--

07:45.256 --> 07:46.090
Clover?

07:46.215 --> 07:47.341
[both yelling]

07:51.721 --> 07:53.973
Easy-peasy, huh, Clover?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.058
Peoples of Madagascar,

07:56.142 --> 08:00.104
Timo and I have put our heads
together and built an ark.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.274
A boat big enough to float us all
to safety.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.318
[all cheering]

08:06.402 --> 08:08.779
And I'm telling you, it is huge.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.740
It's got like a basketball court,

08:10.823 --> 08:12.283
an Olympic sized swimmin' pool.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.826
There's a movie theater on there

08:13.910 --> 08:17.580
and I think there's even a boat
on the boat.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.541
Can't wait to go swimming
in that pool, man.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.377
Without further ado, I give you,

08:23.461 --> 08:27.632
our way off this sinking island. The ark.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.635
I don't get it.
Wasn't it supposed to be big?

08:30.718 --> 08:34.347
Looked a lot bigger
in the unrealistic presentation materials.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.682
No need to fear my peoples.

08:36.766 --> 08:42.688
What you're seeing here is just a
model... of an ark. Yup.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.900
No, that's the actual ark.
[chuckles and snorts]

08:46.234 --> 08:49.237
Timo. What happened, man. You promised.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.073
Quite frankly, we didn't have the budget,

08:52.156 --> 08:53.866
Your Majesty. Or the manpower.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.035
Or any of the materials.
[chuckles and snorts]

08:56.994 --> 08:58.246
Um... I'm no chemist,

08:58.329 --> 09:01.332
but pretty sure that
thing'll only fit about five lemurs.

09:01.541 --> 09:04.835
I'm sure it's more than that, Pancho.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.547
Hate to be a contrary conchita,
Your Majesty,

09:07.797 --> 09:10.132
but there's a sign on it that says

09:10.216 --> 09:12.593
"Maximum Capacity: five lemurs."

09:12.760 --> 09:15.054
[murmuring in frustration]

09:15.221 --> 09:18.266
Uh, okay, everybody stay calm.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.560
We gotta look at the bright side
here, right?

09:21.435 --> 09:24.355
I mean, at least five of us will survive

09:24.438 --> 09:26.315
the sinking of Madagascar.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.359
Right? Five?

09:28.859 --> 09:30.319
But, which five...

09:31.112 --> 09:34.532
Hey there, King Julien.
Are the rumors true?

09:34.615 --> 09:38.578
Is the island really
sinking to the bottom of the ocean?

09:40.913 --> 09:44.000
No... Nope. Nope.
That's not what we've heard.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.876
The island is rising

09:45.960 --> 09:48.254
and we definitely don't
have a boat with room

09:48.337 --> 09:51.215
for only five lemurs to get
off the island alive.

09:51.299 --> 09:56.887
Not sinking? Stupid, stupid, stupid.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.681
False alarm, boys.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.934
Looks like the maze-boat we built so large

10:02.018 --> 10:05.146
it could carry every animal
on the island to safety

10:05.229 --> 10:06.564
was a waste of time.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.065
Blow it up.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.779
I'm sorry, but...
Who gave the rats explosives?

10:15.531 --> 10:18.159
I can't believe I fell
for one of Karl's traps.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.785
Me. It makes me so...

10:19.869 --> 10:22.038
so, so angry.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.082
Clover, that's it. Get angry.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.292
I am angry.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.045
No, angrier. Karl's laughing at you.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.880
His walls are laughing at you.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.423
They think you're weak, Clover.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.259
[yelling and punching]

10:47.980 --> 10:51.400
Hello, Clover, I see you
enjoyed our little welcoming--

10:53.361 --> 10:55.571
What did you do with King Julien's
stuffed animal, Karl?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.156
Where is Captain Booty-Butt?

10:57.239 --> 10:59.784
I have no idea what you're talking about.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.495
Say goodbye to your bug friend.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.456
Oh, Chauncey, no.

11:05.956 --> 11:12.254
All right, I'll talk. I'll talk.
Just spare my beloved.

11:13.047 --> 11:18.719
Yes. I stole Captain
Booty-Butt as part of my brilliant plan

11:18.803 --> 11:22.098
to stage a coup in a small
uranium-rich country

11:22.181 --> 11:27.186
where I would install the plushy
as a ruthless dictator

11:27.269 --> 11:31.148
and I would pull the strings
like the puppet master.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.735
"Captain Booty Butt" would
develop horrible weapons

11:34.819 --> 11:39.698
that he would unleash upon poor
King Julien and all his people.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.451
Oh, oh, the irony.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.704
King Julien bombed out of existence

11:45.788 --> 11:49.125
by his favorite plushy toy.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.128
Sadly, I was forced to sell it
to cover the expenses

11:52.211 --> 11:55.214
in rebuilding my family's
poo coffee plantation.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.259
Who'd you sell it to, Karl?
The Crocodiles? The foosa?

11:58.342 --> 12:04.557
Worse... I sold it to... Tammy.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.101
Tammy? Why would she want it?

12:07.935 --> 12:10.146
Put away those dead shark eyes, baby,

12:10.229 --> 12:13.190
'cause momma's got a surprise for you.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.817
Thanks, Mommy.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.361
Hi guys, got a new one today.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.864
A Captain Booty-Butt.
Packaged pretty well.

12:19.947 --> 12:23.451
Box is pretty standard,
four corners and a lid.

12:23.534 --> 12:27.371
You can see
some pretty substantial stitching here

12:27.455 --> 12:29.707
especially along the booty part.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.875
[Tammy] Todd!

12:30.958 --> 12:32.668
Suppertime, baby.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.712
Mom, I'm doing my show.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.672
[Tammy] Butterfish. Don't touch that.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.424
Aw man, I'm hungry, baby.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.341
Sorry about that.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.970
Anyways, I'm guessing this is some
sort of limited edition.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.014
[Tammy] Todd, now!

12:45.556 --> 12:47.433
By using "the future"...

12:47.516 --> 12:50.394
we can tell who gets on the boat
and who doesn't.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.896
We'll know who the five are.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.772
Let's do this.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.816
[yelling] No!
[continues through scene]

13:01.739 --> 13:03.282
So, nobody's going?

13:03.365 --> 13:05.910
That doesn't make any sense. Leave me.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.287
I need time... Everybody out.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.249
I don't believe in no psychic nonsense.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.543
I say five of us just take the boat.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.629
Love it. Horst, you wanna join?

13:16.712 --> 13:21.217
Steal the boat. Have you no dignity?
Have you no shame?

13:22.176 --> 13:24.595
Well, it's pretty clear we don't, right?

13:24.678 --> 13:26.555
I mean, at least, I know I don't.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.560
You really think Tammy
has Captain Booty-Butt?

13:31.644 --> 13:32.978
The tail don't lie, Maurice.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.981
That stuffed animal is here.
I can feel it.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.525
Hi-yah!

13:37.858 --> 13:40.236
I knew you'd come for me one day.

13:40.903 --> 13:44.823
And bless your heart,
you didn't disappoint.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.450
Give us the Booty-Butt.

13:47.701 --> 13:49.662
Never!

13:50.621 --> 13:53.374
Ha. It's the only thing
that'll keep Todd happy

13:53.457 --> 13:56.377
when we take our afternoon naps.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.003
[grunting and growling]

14:01.757 --> 14:05.553
So, Todd isn't gonna give
up his Booty-Butt without a fight.

14:05.636 --> 14:12.268
Todd! Show these people how
much you love that plushy, baby?

14:12.518 --> 14:15.688
I had hoped this could be
resolved without violence...

14:15.771 --> 14:17.106
Well, not really.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.192
Don't do something you're
gonna regret, lil' missy.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.946
You don't get to be an
overbearing stage mom

14:24.029 --> 14:26.073
without knowing how to catfight.

14:40.212 --> 14:44.091
Say, hey there,
little man, you, uh, wouldn't mind

14:44.174 --> 14:46.218
if I picked up Captain Booty-Butt...
you know,

14:46.302 --> 14:50.347
it belongs to King Julien
and he loves it and really needs...

14:51.765 --> 14:55.019
Yeah, you're fine, it's all good.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.149
You're not gonna do that thing...
we're cool...

15:00.232 --> 15:05.237
right, Todd? Okay. Just gonna take...

15:06.322 --> 15:07.448
What are you--

15:07.573 --> 15:08.908
[all yelling]

15:13.454 --> 15:17.541
Bad news, Maurice, you got Todd activated.

15:19.501 --> 15:23.547
Only way to stop Todd now
is a stake through his heart.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.467
And even then, you ain't
got a priest to do the ritual.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.887
[evil laugh]

15:32.932 --> 15:35.768
Call him off, Tammy. Call him off.

15:35.851 --> 15:36.727
Never.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.981
Okay. Okay. Todd.

15:42.149 --> 15:46.195
Let go of Mr. Maurice's jugular
for Mama, baby.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.155
You're lucky I need that arm

15:48.280 --> 15:51.742
for gluin' rhinestones on
Todd's full glitz costumes.

15:54.411 --> 15:58.958
I'm afraid, my peoples, it is time
we made peace with our fate

15:59.041 --> 16:01.627
and said goodbye to our kingdom...

16:01.710 --> 16:05.923
Stop looking at me like that.
I can't drink you all.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.509
There's no time.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.179
Ted, what are you doing?

16:12.262 --> 16:14.264
There might still be time
to get off the island.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.433
Great. I'll get my bag.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.435
Oh, are you coming? Okay.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.857
Going out for milk, guys. Be right back.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.612
Goodbye... my friends.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.784
Why would you leave me at a time
like this, kingdom?

I can't believe it's come to this.

Oh, King Julien, you want
to steal the boat with me?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.729
There's plenty of room
in my group of five.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.403
Gotta go to work!

19:27.666 --> 19:29.751
Peoples. Peoples, please.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.505
Peoples.

Mort, where did you
get a cannon? Nevermind!

19:40.679 --> 19:41.597

19:41.847 --> 19:44.433
Look at us, fighting like animals
over that boat.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.561
We're not animals, we're lemurs,
peoples. Lemurs.

19:47.644 --> 19:51.690
We are beautiful miracles.
We are stardust, peoples.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.067
Yeah, all those dusty bits of stars

19:54.151 --> 19:56.361

I forgot to save myself.

20:03.118 --> 20:05.829
Forgot. I know, right? Cray-cray.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.081
And, that's just the kind of kingly legacy

20:08.165 --> 20:09.249
I want to leave behind.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.293
[murmuring]

20:11.501 --> 20:13.962
So, I've decided who gets to go.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.840
We may not have enough room for everyone,

20:16.924 --> 20:18.300
but we will start with

20:18.383 --> 20:20.427
saving the women and the children first.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.054
That will be our legacy.

nobody's getting off the island

20:36.360 --> 20:37.444
before it sinks.

20:37.527 --> 20:40.614
Ted's right, peoples. It's almost sunrise.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.408
That's when Masikura said
the island would sink.

The future...

20:45.869 --> 20:48.080
Yeah, we got it.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.415
Goodbye, my peoples.

20:50.499 --> 20:54.419
Being your king
was an honor and a privilege.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.130
Oh, you said it, handsome.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.266
This is it, we're all gonna...

21:08.016 --> 21:09.518
I can't even say it.

21:13.021 --> 21:14.648
We got it, Your Majesty.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.525
We got Captain Booty-Butt.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.444
Well, at least I'll have
this last perfect hug

21:21.029 --> 21:22.155
[Mort screaming]

Is the island sinking or not sinking?

Masikura. What is going on?

21:35.919 --> 21:39.548
I don't understand.
I may see metaphorical glimpses

21:39.631 --> 21:41.258
