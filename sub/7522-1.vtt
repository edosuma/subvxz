01:21.331 --> 01:23.905
It won't be so funny
if we end up in a Romanian jail.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.538
Relax. Nobody's been up here in years.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.804
Oh, Christ.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.484
This way?

01:53.572 --> 01:55.197
- Where?
- It's up there?

01:55.282 --> 01:56.527
Hey, you sure it's up there?

01:58.828 --> 02:00.618
He's sure.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.491
He'd better be right. You tell him.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.788
Come on. Let's get the stuff.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.024
Ye of little faith.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.817
<i>Should be a gold mine. </i>

02:32.903 --> 02:35.821
Why the hell
would they build a church out here?

03:19.075 --> 03:20.450
Check this.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.643
Here we go.

03:59.115 --> 04:01.653
My God. Look at the walls.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.547
There's nothing here.

04:19.636 --> 04:23.135
<i>- So. Where's the cave?
- You're standing on it.</i>

04:26.225 --> 04:27.804
So, how do we get in?

04:35.569 --> 04:37.477
Fire in the hole.

04:47.289 --> 04:49.411
Perfect. Let's go.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.231
Shut up.

05:20.322 --> 05:22.362
Shut up!

06:14.585 --> 06:16.743
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

06:57.003 --> 06:59.043
You know what? It's more than a cave.

06:59.130 --> 07:01.585
This one could run deeper than Postojna.

07:06.221 --> 07:07.714
Oh, look at this.

07:08.807 --> 07:10.846
If this is what I think it is,

07:10.933 --> 07:13.174
it's going to be a fantastic find.

07:13.268 --> 07:15.308
<i>Let's have a look at it, shall we?</i>

07:16.563 --> 07:17.762
<i>Yeah. </i>

07:20.193 --> 07:23.193
Hear that? Running water. It's a good sign.

07:34.916 --> 07:36.956
Nic?

07:38.043 --> 07:39.241
<i>Come. Have a look at this. </i>

07:44.008 --> 07:46.047
We're going to need cave divers.

07:46.135 --> 07:48.175
I know just who to call.

08:09.492 --> 08:12.695
No picture, Charlie.
This antenna's a piece of junk.

08:12.787 --> 08:14.696
<i>- How's that?
- Got it.</i>

08:54.497 --> 08:57.698
Strodey! Get your skinny ass down here!

08:57.790 --> 09:01.160
Boys. You found it yet?

09:01.252 --> 09:04.171
No. We looked exactly where
your sonic mapping said we should.

09:04.256 --> 09:07.127
Jesus! My kids could get in and find it
quicker than you two.

09:07.217 --> 09:08.759
- Ready, Top?
- Yeah.

09:09.970 --> 09:11.513
Jack and Tyler back yet?

09:11.597 --> 09:13.222
Not yet.

09:32.409 --> 09:34.152
<i>That's Tyler's unit. He found it. </i>

09:35.412 --> 09:37.452
Bastard did it again.

09:38.624 --> 09:41.328
Jack's gonna be pissed.
He called time five minutes ago.

09:47.716 --> 09:51.299
You don't have to say anything.
I know I was stupid, but... we got it.

09:51.387 --> 09:54.008
Hey, I call time, and you surface.

09:54.097 --> 09:56.137
OK.

10:05.276 --> 10:08.396
<i>- How's that? You got a signal there yet?
- Not yet, Strodey.</i>

10:09.363 --> 10:10.822
<i>- And now?
- Yeah. </i>

10:10.907 --> 10:12.105
Yeah.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.361
<i>- Dr. Nicolai. 
- Hello. </i>

10:13.450 --> 10:14.825
Hey. It's Jack.

10:14.909 --> 10:17.946
<i>- You got some good news?
- Yeah. I've got the funding. </i>

10:18.038 --> 10:20.115
You do? Really?

10:20.208 --> 10:23.292
<i>We've done the surface scans. 
The cave is huge, Jack. </i>

10:23.377 --> 10:25.749
<i>There is a river off the main cavern,</i>

10:26.839 --> 10:31.086
<i>and there's nowhere it can come out
for at least 19 miles. </i>

10:31.177 --> 10:34.095
Sounds like the Amazon
of underground rivers, huh?

10:34.181 --> 10:38.130
<i>Dr. Jennings our biologist is bringing
a cameraman to shoot the whole thing. </i>

10:38.226 --> 10:40.431
<i>But, you know, it's gonna be tough. </i>

10:40.519 --> 10:43.092
<i>Which is why I need your team
and need you to run the show. </i>

10:43.188 --> 10:45.146
Great! When do we start?

10:45.232 --> 10:47.106
<i>We want to start right away. </i>

10:47.193 --> 10:48.817
<i>We're in a hundred percent. </i>

10:48.903 --> 10:52.486
<i>That's great, Jack. 
I can't wait to see you here. Ciao!</i>

10:52.573 --> 10:54.613
- Thanks, Dr. Nicolai.
- Bye!

11:44.292 --> 11:46.450
Good to finally meet you, Dr. Nicolai.

11:46.545 --> 11:49.545
<i>Let me show you around. 
- Please. </i>

11:49.631 --> 11:50.627
What have we got?

11:50.715 --> 11:54.215
That's the main cave, hidden under the church
and half the mountainside.

11:56.222 --> 11:58.260
- Tyler?
- Yeah?

11:58.347 --> 12:00.341
Everything made it OK.

12:00.433 --> 12:03.718
Take a look at this mix computer.
It got a little banged up.

12:04.812 --> 12:05.927
Oh, man. Yep.

12:06.022 --> 12:09.438
All right. Break it down,
and reinstall the programming.

12:09.526 --> 12:11.104
<i>Whoa!</i>

12:12.613 --> 12:13.609
Hello.

12:17.576 --> 12:20.031
<i>I'm just gonna go visit with a fellow scientist. </i>

12:26.710 --> 12:29.331
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:30.505 --> 12:33.839
I'm Tyler McAlister. I'm the first scout.

12:33.926 --> 12:35.585
One second.

12:38.305 --> 12:41.591
- Do you mind if I...
- Sorry. Let me just move this for you.

12:50.525 --> 12:52.933
- Dr. Jennings.
- It's good to meet you.

12:53.028 --> 12:54.605
And this is Alex Kim our cameraman.

12:54.696 --> 12:56.487
Oh, yeah. I've seen your work.

12:56.573 --> 12:58.151
Heard a lot about you, too.

12:58.241 --> 13:00.815
So, it's unusual for a rebreather.

13:00.911 --> 13:03.236
- Who modified it?
- That would be my brother Jack.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.656
- Really?
- Yep.

13:05.749 --> 13:07.873
I did all the reprogramming, though.

13:12.548 --> 13:13.877
Why the canister?

13:13.967 --> 13:17.251
We're using lithium hydroxide
to filter out the CO2.

13:17.343 --> 13:21.887
It's a little dangerous,
but it's much more effective than calcium.

13:21.974 --> 13:23.883
Hope you got a redundancy for this Meg.

13:23.975 --> 13:27.925
There's actually a triple redundancy.
It's the backup, a primary, and a HUD.

13:28.022 --> 13:32.185
So you can stay submerged for what,
18, 20 hours?

13:32.276 --> 13:33.735
24.

13:34.654 --> 13:38.402
Kate. Alex. This is Jack McAlister.

13:38.491 --> 13:40.198
- Dr. Jennings.
- It's a pleasure.

13:40.284 --> 13:44.032
We read about some of
your Yucatan expeditions. Pretty amazing.

13:44.121 --> 13:45.319
Thank you, thank you.

13:45.414 --> 13:48.914
I understand you have a great interest
in cave biology, Mr. McAllister.

13:49.001 --> 13:49.997
I'm starting to.

13:51.378 --> 13:53.585
- And it's just Jack, please.
- Kathryn.

13:53.673 --> 13:56.757
- Perhaps you want to see some samples?
- Yeah, sure.

13:56.842 --> 14:00.591
Hey, bro.
Double-check all the rebreathers, will you?

14:00.680 --> 14:02.672
Yeah. One in 14.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.390
One in 14?

14:04.476 --> 14:06.930
It's the number of cave divers that die each year.

14:11.732 --> 14:12.812
What's this?

14:12.900 --> 14:16.768
It's all that's left of some poor guy
they found in the mouth of the cave.

14:27.123 --> 14:29.163
Tyler? Let's go.

14:32.087 --> 14:34.244
So how did you hook up with these guys?

14:34.338 --> 14:38.170
My dad had a dive business
in North Florida,

14:38.259 --> 14:41.842
and when Jack got out of high school,
he kind of took him under his wing.

14:41.930 --> 14:46.058
- We're all kind of like family.
- And Tyler?

14:47.227 --> 14:49.267
He joined the business out of college.

14:50.355 --> 14:54.139
Briggs we found table-dancing
in a club outside Calgary.

14:57.028 --> 14:59.518
All right, everybody, listen up. Here we go.

15:02.742 --> 15:05.233
<i>- You all right, Strode?
- Yeah, good, man.</i>

15:05.328 --> 15:09.160
I've been analyzing these read-outs,
and here's what we got.

15:09.249 --> 15:12.998
There's an enormous cavern about
300 feet down, just below the cave entrance.

15:13.086 --> 15:18.294
- Dr. Nicolai has already named it Titan Hall.
- Oh, yeah, it's huge, believe me.

15:18.383 --> 15:20.791
There's a sump... Strode?

15:20.886 --> 15:22.925
...right about here,

15:23.013 --> 15:26.428
which then leads
to this underwater passageway.

15:26.515 --> 15:28.141
<i>Look who's here. </i>

15:28.226 --> 15:30.931
<i>We need to find a dry cavern
somewhere in the system</i>

15:31.020 --> 15:33.143
where we can set up advance base camp,

15:33.230 --> 15:36.600
<i>and Dr. Nicolai and Kathryn
can gather their samples. </i>

15:36.693 --> 15:39.528
We'll be under for 12 days.
We're gonna go deep on this one.

15:39.613 --> 15:42.613
<i>- Yeah!
- All right. </i>

15:42.699 --> 15:44.158
Top, anything you want to add?

15:44.242 --> 15:48.490
Everybody just remember, now -
this cave is a very serious piece of work.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.489
<i>It's already taken at least one life. </i>

15:50.581 --> 15:52.574
Respect the cave.

15:54.001 --> 15:56.327
Briggs, you're gonna take first scout.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.081
Ouch.

15:58.173 --> 15:59.548
<i>Right on. </i>

15:59.632 --> 16:02.089
<i>Any questions? All right, listen. </i>

16:02.177 --> 16:03.969
<i>A toast. </i>

16:05.055 --> 16:08.222
- To virgin caves.
To virgin caves!

16:08.308 --> 16:10.052
Cheers. Thank you very much.

16:10.144 --> 16:11.768
To virgin everything.

16:18.485 --> 16:23.989
They built the church to seal the cave
as a display of God's protective power.

16:24.074 --> 16:26.992
Now, try to imagine...

16:27.077 --> 16:30.528
these Knights Templar entering the cave,

16:30.622 --> 16:33.196
and according to the local legend,

16:33.292 --> 16:37.420
fighting these winged demons.

16:38.548 --> 16:41.502
<i>- Demons, huh?
- Yeah. </i>

16:41.592 --> 16:43.418
Well? Did they win?

16:45.845 --> 16:47.553
Unfortunately, no.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.679
European legends always have sad endings.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.229
There you go.

17:03.739 --> 17:05.198
Oh, yeah.

17:05.281 --> 17:08.200
<i>The ladder is quite safe. </i>

17:08.286 --> 17:10.527
- Yeah, I hate ladders.
- Whoa!

17:11.913 --> 17:14.239
Next thing you know they're putting in elevators.

17:14.332 --> 17:15.661
She's such a show-off.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.460
It's the only way to go, doc.

17:32.102 --> 17:34.141
Whoo!

17:35.229 --> 17:36.771
Oh, man.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.895
<i>Titan Hall. </i>

17:38.982 --> 17:41.022
<i>It's awesome. </i>

17:50.619 --> 17:53.573
<i>Pre-dive checklist. O2 sensors calibrated?</i>

17:53.664 --> 17:55.207
Calibrated, check.

17:55.292 --> 17:56.750
Oxygen running 0.4?

17:56.835 --> 17:58.459
0.4. Check.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.794
Now, you find it, you name it. Make it good.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.961
First scout's privilege. I got a few ideas.
You know I'll come up with something good.

18:06.052 --> 18:09.836
OK. Synchronize watches to 0811 on my mark.

18:09.931 --> 18:14.343
Three, two, one, mark.

18:14.435 --> 18:17.520
- All OK?
- I don't think it could be any better, Ty.

18:17.606 --> 18:20.560
- Yeah, I bet.
- All right. Here we go.

18:20.650 --> 18:23.900
This is a long passage,
so I want you to pace yourself now.

18:23.987 --> 18:25.185
Yeah.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.197
Turnaround's one-third, OK?

18:29.617 --> 18:32.654
If I find a dry cavern, I'll give you a call, Jack.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.616
- You'd do that, would you?
- Go and get it!

18:59.230 --> 19:00.890
<i>How's it looking down there?</i>

19:00.982 --> 19:03.189
It's dark, it's deep, and it's wet, Jack.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.945
<i>Give us your current depth. </i>

19:06.029 --> 19:10.027
<i>- Depth at 162.</i>

19:10.117 --> 19:12.323
What's your gas reading?

19:12.411 --> 19:14.949
<i>O2's reading 1800.</i>

19:15.038 --> 19:17.530
<i>So, how you feeling down there, Briggs?</i>

19:17.625 --> 19:20.115
<i>I'm feeling pretty good. 
How you feeling up there?</i>

19:20.210 --> 19:21.372
I'm all right.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.749
<i>How about the warning lights?
How do they look?</i>

19:23.838 --> 19:26.625
<i>Nothing yet. There's a curve
in the tunnel up ahead, though. </i>

19:26.716 --> 19:29.717
<i>Probably gonna lose you guys
on the dark side of the moon. </i>

19:29.803 --> 19:34.132
<i>Tell Tyler I'll give him a call from first base camp
after I set up that fiber optic. </i>

19:35.601 --> 19:38.270
You know, Briggs,
I'd warn you not to be so arrogant,

19:38.353 --> 19:40.642
but then you'd have no personality at all.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.771
<i>Come on, Top. Take away the arrogance... </i>

19:45.110 --> 19:47.149
<i>There he goes. 
- That's it.</i>

19:47.236 --> 19:48.862
Thanks, Strode.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.075
We need you ready around 0100 hours,
all right?

19:53.160 --> 19:54.404
<i>Oh, I've been ready.</i>

19:56.079 --> 19:57.621
You got something to say, say it.

19:58.749 --> 20:01.619
<i>- You know I'm the best scout.
- Maybe so. </i>

20:01.710 --> 20:04.248
But I can count on Briggs.

20:44.420 --> 20:46.745
First scout consolation prize.

20:46.839 --> 20:50.504
- Yeah.
- You wish it was you in there?

20:52.178 --> 20:54.751
I just wanna be first
in a place nobody's ever been.

20:54.847 --> 20:57.005
Well, you and I aren't that different.

20:57.099 --> 21:00.967
I mean, if I find something unique,
I want to put my name on it.

21:01.062 --> 21:02.555
So, what happened?

21:04.815 --> 21:07.566
<i>- It's my brother's call.
Hey, Ty!</i>

21:07.651 --> 21:12.858
Checked the line three times. There's nothing
wrong with it. We just don't have a signal.

21:12.948 --> 21:15.155
Check every five minutes till we get something.

21:15.242 --> 21:16.571
<i>What's up?</i>

21:16.661 --> 21:21.702
- If he doesn't show in ten, I'm sending you in.
- It's Briggs. He's probably just showing off.

21:21.791 --> 21:25.789
Listen, you're probably right,
but go get ready anyways, OK?

21:25.879 --> 21:27.870
Jack!

21:27.963 --> 21:29.790
<i>- Guys! I got him.
- Wakey, wakey. </i>

21:29.881 --> 21:32.207
<i>Titan Hall! Is anybody there?</i>

21:32.300 --> 21:33.843
<i>All right. Get up!</i>

21:33.928 --> 21:36.253
Morning. We're all here, buddy. Where are you?

21:36.347 --> 21:40.344
<i>Good morning to you too, Top. 
I'd say I'm sitting at advance base camp,</i>

21:40.434 --> 21:44.479
<i>which will now be forever known
as... Kublai Khan. </i>

21:44.563 --> 21:46.723
About how far in would you say, Briggs?

21:46.858 --> 21:49.183
<i>Oh... only about... </i>

21:49.277 --> 21:51.317
<i>2.4 miles, Jack. </i>

21:51.404 --> 21:54.854
- Fantastic!
- 2.4!

21:54.948 --> 21:58.650
<i>I'm uploading the data now. 
Read it and weep. </i>

21:58.745 --> 22:00.867
<i>It's amazing in here, man. </i>

22:00.954 --> 22:03.161
<i>I haven't seen a hole like this in a long time. </i>

22:03.249 --> 22:04.873
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

22:04.959 --> 22:07.996
<i>- Briggs!
- Yeah. Hold on a sec. Something ran past me. </i>

22:08.087 --> 22:10.661
<i> Got it!</i>

22:11.799 --> 22:14.884
<i>Kathryn, can you and Nicolai see this?</i>

22:14.970 --> 22:19.632
<i>It's some kind of a large rat,
or a mole or something. </i>

22:19.725 --> 22:22.974
<i>Buck teeth, webbed feet,
looks a lot like Tyler. </i>

22:26.731 --> 22:28.142
<i>- You all right, man?
- Shit!</i>

22:28.232 --> 22:30.688
<i>Yeah. </i>

22:32.737 --> 22:35.311
<i>I think I pissed him off
with that Tyler comment. </i>

22:35.407 --> 22:37.530
Listen, man, good work. Get some sleep now.

22:37.618 --> 22:40.287
<i>Yeah, yeah. Some sleep. </i>

22:40.370 --> 22:43.122
<i>- You need anything down there, man?
- Hold on a sec. </i>

22:44.875 --> 22:46.996
<i>Briggs?</i>

22:47.084 --> 22:49.836
<i>Yeah. Yeah, hold on, guys. </i>

22:50.922 --> 22:52.961
<i>- I'm gonna to try to get... </i>

22:53.049 --> 22:55.041
<i>- There's something that... 
- Briggs?</i>

22:55.134 --> 22:57.970
- What's up, Strode?
- Could be feedback in the line.

22:58.054 --> 23:00.759
<i>What was that? God damn it!
- Key me if you can hear me.</i>

23:02.475 --> 23:05.227
Fiber optic must have snapped, huh?

23:05.312 --> 23:07.803
Maybe we should send in a second scout,
to be safe.

23:07.898 --> 23:10.650
No, come on. We gotta get in the water.

23:15.446 --> 23:17.984
Top and I are in the water in 30 minutes.

23:18.074 --> 23:20.826
Strode, Tyler, fix the cable on the way in.
Let's do it.

23:42.099 --> 23:44.008
<i>Let's take it a little slow. </i>

23:44.100 --> 23:46.140
<i>Break in the line could be anywhere. </i>

23:47.229 --> 23:49.269
<i>Right on your tail, mate. </i>

24:03.413 --> 24:05.321
<i>It's not bad, huh, Top?</i>

24:05.413 --> 24:07.453
<i>Yeah, there's a lot of life in here. </i>

24:07.541 --> 24:10.211
<i>You OK?</i>

24:10.293 --> 24:13.995
<i>- Yeah. Just thinking about Briggs. 
- He can take care of himself. </i>

24:14.089 --> 24:16.497
<i>How long till we reach the cavern?</i>

24:16.592 --> 24:19.262
<i>It's a long run, Nicolai. Enjoy the ride. </i>

24:27.895 --> 24:30.468
<i>This beats anything in the Yucatan by a mile. </i>

24:30.564 --> 24:35.559
<i>Hey, Kim, did you get a shot
of those cave draperies? Sick, dude!</i>

24:35.653 --> 24:38.226
<i>I got it. </i>

24:39.823 --> 24:41.863
<i>It's totally rockin'.</i>

24:54.505 --> 24:57.708
<i>Dr. Nicolai. 
You and Katherine should check this out. </i>

24:57.800 --> 25:00.635
<i>Advance base camp
should be about 200 yards ahead. </i>

25:00.719 --> 25:02.759
<i>Thank you. We'll see you there. </i>

26:01.697 --> 26:03.737
Yo, Briggs!

26:05.661 --> 26:07.320
Briggs!

26:13.292 --> 26:14.786
Briggs!

26:18.798 --> 26:20.708
Hey, Briggs!

26:20.801 --> 26:25.130
About time you two ladies got here!
Come take a look at this.

26:30.602 --> 26:32.844
We're not the first ones here after all.

26:32.938 --> 26:35.263
Looks like somebody lost his boots.

26:37.860 --> 26:40.184
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

26:42.613 --> 26:46.232
<i>Tyler, hang on. 
I'm gonna make a jump here for a second. </i>

26:50.831 --> 26:54.330
<i>Strode, how you doing?
- Good. I think I saw one of those moles. </i>

26:54.418 --> 26:57.205
<i>- Be right back. 
- All right. I'll keep looking for the break. </i>

27:09.975 --> 27:13.842
<i>Strode, I found the break right here. 
It's gonna take me a few minutes. </i>

27:13.937 --> 27:16.891
<i>Strode? Hey, Strode?</i>

27:16.982 --> 27:19.652
<i>Yeah, right here. Just give me another minute. </i>

27:21.111 --> 27:24.195
There's a flat area just up there
where we can set up camp.

27:24.281 --> 27:26.950
Any hot showers?
That would make my day.

27:27.034 --> 27:28.658
I've had enough water.

27:33.331 --> 27:36.535
<i>Tyler? You still reading me, mate?</i>

27:36.626 --> 27:38.666
<i>Tyler?</i>

27:51.017 --> 27:52.594
<i>Whoo!</i>

28:08.451 --> 28:10.407
What the hell?

28:12.955 --> 28:13.986
What the...

28:18.962 --> 28:21.001
Son of a bitch!

28:27.302 --> 28:30.055
Hey, Tyler. Tyler, you read me?

28:31.140 --> 28:33.382
<i>What the hell? Strode. </i>

28:33.476 --> 28:36.762
<i>This cable looks... chewed. </i>

28:36.854 --> 28:40.270
Mate, you there?

28:40.941 --> 28:42.981
Argh!

28:47.282 --> 28:50.282
<i>- Help! Help!
- Strode? Strode!</i>

28:52.369 --> 28:55.122
<i>Strode! Can you hear me?
Where are you, Strode?</i>

29:23.359 --> 29:26.146
<i>Tyler!
Jesus! What the hell was that?</i>

29:29.574 --> 29:30.772
<i>Top!</i>

29:34.996 --> 29:37.784
Tyler, Tyler, hey... You all right?

29:37.874 --> 29:41.657
- Yeah. Yeah. I think so.
- Where's Strode? Huh?

29:41.752 --> 29:43.294
I... I don't know.

29:43.379 --> 29:45.870
- Shit! Top.
- Bring the J-bar.

29:45.965 --> 29:49.050
He kept saying, "help,"
like he was being attacked, so I went back,

29:49.135 --> 29:51.211
but I don't know what the hell exploded.

29:52.305 --> 29:54.428
<i>At least the dive line’s intact. </i>

29:57.227 --> 29:59.303
<i>Let's keep our eyes open. </i>

30:04.150 --> 30:07.104
<i>Looks like the whole damn tunnel collapsed. </i>

30:07.194 --> 30:10.065
<i>He's got to be in here. 
It's the only way through. </i>

30:16.288 --> 30:18.613
<i> Son of a bitch!</i>

30:22.210 --> 30:24.832
<i>Jack?
That's his counter lung. </i>

30:24.921 --> 30:26.332
<i>Oh, man, this isn't good. </i>

30:28.551 --> 30:30.424
<i>Jack, look out! It's coming down!</i>

30:31.303 --> 30:32.003
<i>Shit!</i>

30:34.639 --> 30:36.548
<i>Jack, back on the dive line. </i>

31:05.962 --> 31:08.287
All right, listen up.

31:08.381 --> 31:11.549
<i>We have a few realities to face here, people. </i>

31:11.635 --> 31:15.004
The first is that we're not going out
the way we came.

31:15.097 --> 31:17.885
The passage is completely blocked.

31:17.975 --> 31:23.895
The second is that
we're not even gonna be missed for 12 days,

31:23.982 --> 31:26.981
which is right about when our supplies run out.

31:27.067 --> 31:30.685
<i>- So we're gonna have to find our own way out.
Hold on a second!</i>

31:30.780 --> 31:33.899
You still haven't told us
what happened to Strode.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.398
Tyler said it sounded like
he was being attacked.

31:36.493 --> 31:40.954
He was Special Forces,
for Christ's sake, Jack.

31:41.040 --> 31:44.041
He knew what the hell he was doing.

31:44.127 --> 31:48.172
Something got him. I'll bet you it was the
same thing that got whoever owns those boots.

31:50.174 --> 31:52.795
We're all hurting, man.

31:52.884 --> 31:55.554
<i>Strode was a friend to all of us. </i>

31:55.637 --> 31:57.677
Don't you forget that.

31:59.975 --> 32:02.644
What do you think, Dr. Nicolai?

32:02.728 --> 32:05.813
Is there anything
that could have attacked Strode?

32:05.899 --> 32:11.604
I don't know. The mole is the largest animal
we've seen in this type of system.

32:11.696 --> 32:14.566
Our friend here does prove
there's an abundant food supply.

32:16.450 --> 32:20.318
Question is, is he at the top of the food chain,
or is there something else?

32:20.413 --> 32:22.370
Strode could have just screwed up his mix.

32:22.456 --> 32:24.330
<i>Narcosis, hallucinations... </i>

32:24.416 --> 32:27.833
It happens. I mean, he panics,
he ruptures his scooter.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.163
Whatever it was, it doesn't matter now.

32:30.256 --> 32:34.206
Because right now our primary concern
is getting out of here alive.

32:34.302 --> 32:37.089
Jack, this is the Carpathians.

32:37.180 --> 32:40.264
<i>We could spend an eternity
trying to find a way out. </i>

32:40.350 --> 32:42.922
<i>If... there even is one.</i>

32:43.018 --> 32:45.972
Come on, Jack, we wait.
A rescue team will come for us.

32:46.063 --> 32:50.940
Dr. Nicolai, we're a mile below the surface
and three miles in.

32:52.862 --> 32:56.445
The best people to get us out
are all right here.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.987
<i>We are the rescue team.</i>

33:01.746 --> 33:07.251
Now, here's how it's gonna go. Top and I, we're
gonna start scouting for an exit immediately.

33:07.336 --> 33:10.703
Now I'd recommend that you all get some rest.
You're gonna need it.

33:11.797 --> 33:13.837
<i>Top. </i>

33:24.728 --> 33:26.804
I never lost anybody, Top.

33:26.897 --> 33:30.183
I don't like it, Mac. Something's not right.

33:30.275 --> 33:31.473
No shit, buddy.

33:43.663 --> 33:46.450
Narcosis my ass!
That's bullshit and you know it.

33:46.541 --> 33:48.581
I'm not getting into this.

33:48.668 --> 33:52.915
Why is that, Tyler? Because you forgot
to stick with your dive buddy?

33:56.552 --> 33:58.046
You asshole! I had no idea...

34:01.848 --> 34:03.472
<i>Hey! You guys!</i>

34:03.558 --> 34:06.678
Hey! Stop it!

34:06.769 --> 34:08.893
You guys, cut it out! Stop it!

34:09.981 --> 34:13.849
Hey! We just lost a friend,
and this is how you deal with it?

34:13.944 --> 34:15.688
Come on.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.001
Never seen a white algae bed before.

34:40.094 --> 34:43.927
Yeah. Looks like we found
the base of the food chain.

34:45.143 --> 34:47.014
It's not the base I'm worried about.

34:50.313 --> 34:52.520
Someone made it this far.

35:00.574 --> 35:02.448
Let's keep moving.

35:18.759 --> 35:20.799
Nicolai. Look at this.

35:31.272 --> 35:33.845
- It's a parasite.
- Mm-hm.

35:33.941 --> 35:35.981
That's from the mole.

35:36.068 --> 35:40.362
- Yeah.
- And this is from the salamander.

35:47.162 --> 35:50.164
- It's the same parasite.
- Uh huh.

36:00.927 --> 36:03.335
Think we should have tried door number two.

36:03.430 --> 36:06.964
It looks like it opens up.
I'm gonna try to slip through.

36:40.258 --> 36:43.461
<i>Ah, shit. Hey, Top?</i>

36:43.553 --> 36:45.296
Yeah?

36:45.388 --> 36:47.262
You mind backing up, bud?

36:48.683 --> 36:50.723
Backing up.

36:54.355 --> 36:55.186
Jack.

36:59.152 --> 37:00.101
Jack!

37:00.779 --> 37:01.692
Jack!

37:02.989 --> 37:03.902
Jack!

37:05.408 --> 37:06.985
Jack!

37:16.795 --> 37:18.538
Get the medical kit!

37:19.756 --> 37:22.128
I got it!
What happened?

37:22.217 --> 37:24.257
Ah, shit! Look at him. You all right?

37:25.638 --> 37:29.717
Top, what do you need?
Tell me! What happened, Top?

37:29.807 --> 37:32.761
- Found that hooked in his sling.
- What the hell is that?

37:32.852 --> 37:35.889
- I cut it off.
- Did you get a look at it?

37:35.980 --> 37:37.938
- It jumped me too fast.
- Hold still.

37:38.024 --> 37:40.777
- Jesus, how big was it?
- It's big.

37:40.860 --> 37:42.818
- How's it looking?
- Ripped you up good.

37:42.904 --> 37:45.229
Need to put you on an antibiotic.
Give me a syringe!

37:45.323 --> 37:47.565
You son of a bitch!

37:47.659 --> 37:49.367
<i>All right. </i>

37:55.166 --> 37:57.953
There's a... There's a resemblance
to amphibian tissue,

37:58.044 --> 38:01.129
but these hair follicles would seem
to rule that out.

38:02.215 --> 38:05.335
I mean, the only thing I do know -
this is definitely a predator.

38:05.427 --> 38:07.052
So now we're part of the food chain.

38:07.137 --> 38:10.720
We always have been.
Just forgotten that, living in cities.

38:10.808 --> 38:13.892
Just reflexes. Don't worry.

38:16.855 --> 38:20.270
- What is it?
- Without DNA testing, it's impossible to tell.

38:20.358 --> 38:22.897
<i>It may be something
We've never seen before. </i>

38:22.986 --> 38:28.194
Every cave organism we've discovered so far
originated on the surface.

38:28.283 --> 38:30.323
Over time, they've adapted.

38:30.411 --> 38:35.156
Lost pigmentation and sight, developed
a heightened sense of hearing and smell.

38:37.210 --> 38:39.878
If this is a totally self-contained ecosystem...

38:39.962 --> 38:44.589
Yes, we may have discovered the primeval
creature that has evolved in total isolation.

38:44.675 --> 38:48.044
Well, it looks like a piece
from those things on the mosaic.

38:48.137 --> 38:49.796
Look.

38:49.888 --> 38:52.095
- What?
- There.

38:52.182 --> 38:54.590
<i>It's still alive?</i>

38:54.685 --> 38:57.852
- Those tendrils look familiar?
- Yeah. The parasite.

38:57.938 --> 39:00.145
It appears to be ubiquitous.

39:02.110 --> 39:04.268
All right, let's pack it up.

39:05.864 --> 39:08.651
It's time to go.

39:11.035 --> 39:12.529
We should wait here.

39:13.828 --> 39:15.868
Wow, that's just brilliant, doc.

39:15.956 --> 39:20.084
You really wanna be sitting here on your ass
when the lights go out?

39:25.341 --> 39:29.090
OK, people, take only what you need,
but keep your dive gear.

39:46.153 --> 39:48.360
<i>Hey, maybe there's a way to climb out. </i>

39:48.447 --> 39:50.487
Yeah, better up than down.

40:07.258 --> 40:09.795
<i>Looks like we found the owner
of those boots. </i>

40:13.180 --> 40:14.556
Teeth marks.

40:17.477 --> 40:19.303
Let's go.

41:07.485 --> 41:09.194
<i>Take a break right here. </i>

41:09.279 --> 41:13.656
<i>- Talk about a fork in the road, huh?
A fork or a dead end?</i>

41:19.248 --> 41:21.655
<i>- Where's Jack?
- Scouting the tunnel. </i>

41:23.876 --> 41:25.916
So, why aren't we helping him?

41:26.004 --> 41:29.669
You know the drill, Briggs.
Give him a chance to read the sediment.

41:29.758 --> 41:33.127
Yeah, I know the drill, Top.
You don't have to tell me about drills.

41:33.220 --> 41:35.260
Sonar gun's right here...

41:35.347 --> 41:37.139
Relax.

41:41.395 --> 41:43.139
What the hell's going on?

41:46.608 --> 41:48.315
<i>Come on, Jack. </i>

41:48.401 --> 41:50.690
Just wanna get the hell out of here.

41:52.823 --> 41:55.278
Well, maybe you ought to follow me, Briggs.

42:07.797 --> 42:10.085
This is bullshit.

42:14.136 --> 42:16.971
<i>Jack didn't pick the dominant artery. </i>

42:19.558 --> 42:22.131
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

42:23.228 --> 42:26.265
This is the one right here.
Take a look at it.

42:29.860 --> 42:32.530
There's something in there
that wasn't there before.

42:35.074 --> 42:38.159
Well, why don't you go scout it out for us,
Briggs?

42:44.207 --> 42:46.081
Forget about it.

42:53.301 --> 42:55.340
On belay.

42:56.596 --> 42:58.635
<i>You're safe to climb. </i>

43:01.976 --> 43:04.681
You gotta let me change that bandage
when we get to the top.

43:04.771 --> 43:06.015
I'm all right.

43:07.564 --> 43:10.056
Looks like it's getting infected. You sure?

43:10.150 --> 43:13.733
How many expeditions
we been on together, Top?

43:13.821 --> 43:15.979
Too many.

43:16.073 --> 43:19.573
We need a break.
Not with that thing out there.

43:19.660 --> 43:21.700
You gotta let them rest, Jack.

43:23.414 --> 43:25.871
- Once we hit the water.
- The water?

43:25.958 --> 43:28.628
<i>- I don't hear any water, Jack.
- Yeah. </i>

43:28.711 --> 43:30.704
I smell it.

43:57.573 --> 43:59.233
Not now.

43:59.325 --> 44:01.448
We're gonna need footage like this.

44:01.536 --> 44:03.991
<i>- Get that camera out of my face!
- Hold on a second. </i>

44:04.080 --> 44:06.322
Hey, hey. Quit...

44:08.335 --> 44:11.252
<i>That camera paid for this expedition. 
- Alex.</i>

44:13.882 --> 44:15.958
I'm sorry.

44:17.052 --> 44:18.843
Sorry.

44:18.929 --> 44:20.969
Yeah.

44:28.939 --> 44:30.481
There's a current.

44:31.983 --> 44:34.854
Grab some food. You two keep an eye out.

44:36.404 --> 44:38.065
<i>We'll rest for 20.</i>

45:20.699 --> 45:24.199
I'm getting a little worried.
Gangrene might be setting in.

45:24.286 --> 45:28.331
- I don't think those antibiotics are working.
- What should we do?

45:28.415 --> 45:31.665
- Not sure we can do anything.
Maybe I should talk to him?

45:31.752 --> 45:35.204
I've never seen Jack like this before.
He's completely losing it.

45:35.298 --> 45:38.132
We're five miles in.
We're not going back.

45:38.217 --> 45:41.301
That's for sure.
Jack's the most experienced one.

45:41.386 --> 45:44.174
If anyone can get us out, it's him.
Come on!

45:44.264 --> 45:46.553
We don't know where the hell we're going.

45:52.814 --> 45:54.273
How you doing?

45:58.737 --> 46:00.777
Jack...

46:00.865 --> 46:02.905
I'm worried about you.

46:06.078 --> 46:08.117
Briggs is gonna be a problem.

46:08.205 --> 46:10.245
You know that, don't you?

46:18.340 --> 46:21.127
I can't save them, Tyler,
if they don't trust me.

46:22.512 --> 46:24.551
I'm gonna need your help with that.

46:26.140 --> 46:28.180
You understand?

46:28.267 --> 46:30.307
OK.

46:36.191 --> 46:38.516
<i>All right. Let's get in the water. </i>

46:54.211 --> 46:57.544
<i>Let's not get too spread out. 
Everybody should be in the water by now. </i>

46:57.631 --> 47:00.750
<i>I'm in now. 
Top and Tyler are right behind me. </i>

47:03.552 --> 47:06.719
- Top, if Jack gets any worse...
- I know.

47:06.805 --> 47:08.845
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

47:50.017 --> 47:52.174
<i>The current's pushing us up. </i>

47:53.310 --> 47:54.888
<i>Yeah, I feel it. </i>

47:54.979 --> 47:57.221
<i>Looks like it's pretty choppy up there. </i>

48:10.912 --> 48:12.952
All right, listen up. Secure all your gear.

48:13.040 --> 48:17.417
- Jack, we don't know where the rapids go.
- What do you want to do, go back?

48:17.502 --> 48:20.953
- She's right. We should find another way.
- This is the goddamn way!

48:23.132 --> 48:25.588
<i>- I'll go first.
- Yeah, get going. </i>

48:31.475 --> 48:36.386
- All right, Dr. Nicolai, you're coming with me.
- You'll be fine, all right? Come on.

48:36.479 --> 48:39.053
Tyler, you take Kathryn. Let's go!

48:39.149 --> 48:41.189
Briggs, Charlie, go now!

48:47.365 --> 48:49.691
Jack!

48:58.711 --> 48:59.790
Argh!

48:59.879 --> 49:02.121
<i>Dr. Nicolai!</i>

49:02.214 --> 49:04.254
Here.

49:05.676 --> 49:08.083
<i>Now put your goggles on, and hang onto me. </i>

49:10.097 --> 49:12.136
Here we go.

49:14.560 --> 49:17.430
Your brother's got a serious death wish.

49:17.521 --> 49:21.056
Listen to me. You have to trust him, OK?
We will get out.

49:21.149 --> 49:23.023
It's OK. You'll be fine. Come on.

49:34.038 --> 49:36.410
I'm stuck!

49:36.498 --> 49:38.491
- What is it?
- Tyler, something has me!

49:38.584 --> 49:41.538
- Cut your harness free!
- Tyler!

49:41.628 --> 49:44.713
- Kathryn, the current's too strong!
- Ty, I'm stuck!

49:45.299 --> 49:48.051
- I can't get back!
- Ty!

49:48.136 --> 49:49.511
Kathryn!

49:49.595 --> 49:51.635
Tyler!

50:00.522 --> 50:02.147
<i>Tyler!</i>

50:02.232 --> 50:03.607
Tyler!

50:05.485 --> 50:08.771
My God!

50:09.573 --> 50:10.902
Tyler!

50:12.284 --> 50:13.564
<i>Help me!</i>

50:48.112 --> 50:50.734
What happened? You OK?

50:50.823 --> 50:52.862
- Something had me back there.
- You hurt?

50:52.950 --> 50:54.990
I'm OK. I'm OK.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.424
There's something in the water!

51:19.476 --> 51:21.516
Oh, shit! It's some kind of eel.

51:28.403 --> 51:31.439
<i>Does anybody have eyes on
Dr. Nicolai or Charlie?</i>

51:31.531 --> 51:33.939
Yeah, I got Charlie and Kathryn.

51:34.034 --> 51:37.402
Nicolai's wracked up on the rocks
above the falls. He's in bad shape.

51:37.496 --> 51:39.239
All right. Flare's coming up. Top.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.163
I see 'em.

51:43.252 --> 51:47.379
Yeah, looks like a couple of hundred yards.
All right. Come on. Come on.

51:48.798 --> 51:50.837
<i>Alex, you all right?</i>

51:53.095 --> 51:56.345
- Well, that was a great idea.
- You're alive, aren't you?

51:56.431 --> 51:57.594
<i>Jack. </i>

51:58.683 --> 52:01.720
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah.

52:01.812 --> 52:03.852
Stick close together.

52:17.076 --> 52:21.027
That's Dr. Nicolai.
Top, light another one. I'm gonna go after him.

52:22.624 --> 52:24.664
Help me!

52:26.253 --> 52:28.293
<i>Nicolai!</i>

52:28.380 --> 52:30.337
I'm here!

52:51.862 --> 52:53.487
Nicolai!

52:56.658 --> 52:59.328
- Nicolai!
- Everybody stay put!

53:01.038 --> 53:02.662
Nicolai!

53:05.959 --> 53:08.201
- We have to help him!
- No! Everybody in a circle!

53:08.295 --> 53:12.423
- Backs to the centre.
We have to help him! Nicolai!

53:20.058 --> 53:22.096
Dr. Nicolai?

53:49.170 --> 53:51.708
We can't just sit here.
There's got to be a shore close.

53:51.798 --> 53:54.004
Nobody's going anywhere till Jack gets back.

53:55.092 --> 53:58.710
What was that? You hear that?

54:02.016 --> 54:04.553
Oh, shit! What the hell was that?

54:12.360 --> 54:16.025
Get back in a circle!
- I can't take this! God!

54:24.830 --> 54:26.989
Nicolai!

54:32.463 --> 54:34.372
Nicolai!

54:59.324 --> 55:00.866
It's over.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.199
Let's get the hell out of the water.

55:04.287 --> 55:08.451
He said he didn't want to go deeper, Jack!
He was your responsibility!

55:08.542 --> 55:11.827
He said he didn't want to go deeper.

55:11.920 --> 55:13.959
It's over, Kathryn.

55:28.270 --> 55:30.642
There's a ledge here. We can walk.

55:41.991 --> 55:45.076
- What the hell is that?
- Echolocation.

55:45.162 --> 55:49.824
This thing can probably see us as easily
as a bat sees a moth in complete darkness.

55:57.382 --> 55:59.624
Wait here. I'm gonna scout ahead.

56:06.808 --> 56:09.596
It's a strong current.
It's definitely worth a try.

56:09.686 --> 56:11.097
Yeah.

56:12.689 --> 56:15.394
That's gotta come up on the surface.

56:16.484 --> 56:19.770
I'm not sure I like the idea of deep water
right now.

56:23.367 --> 56:24.695
<i>Tyler. </i>

56:24.785 --> 56:26.777
You and I are going up this wall.

56:26.870 --> 56:30.405
But this is the main water flow.
We just follow it out of the system.

56:30.499 --> 56:34.117
When we get to the top, we'll secure ropes.
The rest of you come up on ascenders.

56:34.210 --> 56:36.369
Jack, I'm the best climber. I'll go first.

56:36.463 --> 56:40.377
Nobody's climbing anywhere. There's
a huge exit sign right here in front of us...

56:40.467 --> 56:43.421
You don't have a goddamn clue what's going on.

56:46.473 --> 56:47.802
None of you do.

56:47.892 --> 56:49.636
It's a trap.

56:54.232 --> 56:57.647
- The wall's the safest option.
- Jack's right. I'll go.

56:57.734 --> 56:59.442
I said no.

57:01.530 --> 57:03.357
Let's go.

57:18.714 --> 57:20.256
You see that?

57:20.341 --> 57:22.748
<i>That's where we're going. </i>

57:22.843 --> 57:25.512
- I'll route the left. Let's do it.
- All right.

57:30.768 --> 57:32.393
A little insurance for you guys.

57:32.478 --> 57:37.187
We bored out these propane valves.
Should give you a nice flame for four or five feet.

57:37.274 --> 57:40.609
Scare anything that tries to come close.
Enough for a couple of blasts.

57:40.695 --> 57:42.854
- Kim, give me a hand with this.
- Yeah.

57:58.921 --> 58:01.412
Jack's ill, Tyler. He's not fit to lead anymore.

58:06.346 --> 58:09.512
- He's not the man we started with.
- He's my brother.

58:13.353 --> 58:14.811
Charlie!

58:15.897 --> 58:17.936
<i>I told you no!</i>

58:18.023 --> 58:21.523
Hey, be careful!
- Get the rope.

58:21.610 --> 58:24.067
Get your ass back down here, Charlie!

58:24.155 --> 58:26.646
I'll be all right!

58:28.535 --> 58:31.868
<i>The girl's quick, man. Get the rope. 
OK, I'm on belay. </i>

58:33.373 --> 58:35.033
Let's find a route. Let's go!

58:36.960 --> 58:39.000
Top, you got it?

58:39.088 --> 58:41.494
<i>Damn, that girl moves fast. </i>

58:41.589 --> 58:43.628
<i>Be careful up there, Charlie!</i>

58:43.716 --> 58:45.092
<i>Charlie!</i>

58:47.178 --> 58:49.930
<i>Charlie. You got good holds to your right. </i>

58:50.015 --> 58:52.636
<i>- Keep moving right. </i>

58:57.314 --> 58:59.851
<i>I think she’s over the edge. 
All right!</i>

58:59.941 --> 59:04.734
<i>How the heck are we gonna follow that?
She went over the bump. She's good. </i>

59:04.822 --> 59:06.861
<i>I can't even see her. </i>

59:06.948 --> 59:08.857
<i>I got it here. Keep feeding it out. </i>

59:20.671 --> 59:21.833
There we go.

59:38.230 --> 59:41.230
<i>How's it holding?
How's it holding, Tyler?</i>

59:41.316 --> 59:43.356
<i>Looks good. </i>

59:58.375 --> 01:00:00.700
Safe!

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.875
<i>Talk to me, Charlie. What's going on?</i>

01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:08.676
<i>Is the line set? Ready to climb, Charlie. </i>

01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:12.760
<i>Charlie?</i>

01:00:12.848 --> 01:00:17.391
Jack, I'm over the edge. I can feel a draught.

01:00:17.478 --> 01:00:20.230
I'm going up.
Go for it.

01:00:50.886 --> 01:00:52.843
What's going on, Charlie?

01:00:55.766 --> 01:00:57.176
<i>You safe, Charlie?</i>

01:00:57.267 --> 01:00:58.548
<i>Charlie?</i>

01:01:19.332 --> 01:01:20.707
Charlie!

01:01:23.294 --> 01:01:24.872
<i>Charlie!</i>

01:01:32.094 --> 01:01:33.506
Charlie, talk to me!

01:01:33.596 --> 01:01:34.971
<i>Charlie!</i>

01:02:01.249 --> 01:02:04.499
Get me down!

01:02:04.586 --> 01:02:07.669
<i>- It's up here!
- Get that rope free!</i>

01:02:07.755 --> 01:02:10.246
- Jack!
- I'm going up!

01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:11.717
Come on, guys! Come on!

01:02:20.602 --> 01:02:24.053
Get me down! Save me!

01:02:24.147 --> 01:02:25.938
Move!

01:03:40.474 --> 01:03:41.849
Charlie!

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.743
They fly! They freakin' fly!

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.225
No!

01:04:38.783 --> 01:04:40.575
Charlie!

01:05:31.586 --> 01:05:34.587
There's enough secured rope
to make it to the opening.

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.008
What's happening to you?

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:49.057
As long as we stay together as a group,
we can hold them back.

01:05:51.022 --> 01:05:53.513
I think I know now.

01:05:55.068 --> 01:05:57.310
- It's a parasite.
- That's from a parasite?

01:05:57.403 --> 01:06:02.030
It mutates the host so they can both survive
down here in this environment.

01:06:02.116 --> 01:06:05.734
- And that's what's gonna happen to all of us?
- I don't know, Alex.

01:06:07.705 --> 01:06:09.330
I'd say...

01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:12.085
it entered your bloodstream
through one of your cuts.

01:06:13.753 --> 01:06:16.423
Jack, it's affecting your nervous system.

01:06:16.507 --> 01:06:19.175
So the other cavers? It happened to them.

01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:23.296
- So, what? It just ate them?
- No.

01:06:23.389 --> 01:06:26.971
They weren't eaten by the creatures.

01:06:27.057 --> 01:06:28.885
<i>They are the creatures. Right, Jack?</i>

01:06:28.977 --> 01:06:31.017
<i>And now there's nothing human left. </i>

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:35.599
They're enjoying this, Kathryn.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.899
So now you understand them, Jack?

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:41.818
Jack. Jack, you're gonna be fine.

01:06:41.907 --> 01:06:45.074
- You've gotten us this far.
- Got us this far, Tyler?

01:06:45.161 --> 01:06:49.621
Come on. He got Charlie and Dr. Nicolai dead.

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:51.534
<i>That's what he got. </i>

01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:54.625
No. No more.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:56.585
The river's the way out.

01:06:56.671 --> 01:06:59.423
Kathryn's right. I'm with her.

01:07:04.597 --> 01:07:06.635
Who else is coming?

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:08.515
<i>Alex?</i>

01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:13.351
If you ever wanna see the sun again,
you should follow me now.

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:23.487
This is bullshit! We have to stay together!

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:27.441
Tyler, look at him. He's not human.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:30.074
<i>We need you with us. </i>

01:07:30.164 --> 01:07:32.156
Tyler?

01:07:35.503 --> 01:07:36.499
Good luck.

01:07:45.721 --> 01:07:47.843
<i>Fine. Let's get in the water. </i>

01:08:12.414 --> 01:08:14.870
Tell me we're doing the right thing.

01:08:17.795 --> 01:08:19.835
Don't stop believing in him, Ty.

01:08:53.915 --> 01:08:55.575
<i>It's getting cold. </i>

01:09:09.096 --> 01:09:10.506
Where to?

01:09:11.932 --> 01:09:13.131
Down.

01:09:14.894 --> 01:09:16.934
<i>You sure?</i>

01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:19.600
Yeah, down.

01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:25.649
- My lead. Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:09:44.299 --> 01:09:46.006
You OK?

01:09:46.093 --> 01:09:49.792
Yeah, it's solid! Off rope!

01:10:00.398 --> 01:10:01.513
Argh!

01:10:03.026 --> 01:10:05.019
<i>- Tyler!
- Tyler!</i>

01:10:09.408 --> 01:10:11.115
Top, cover!

01:10:13.078 --> 01:10:14.358
Shit!

01:10:15.872 --> 01:10:17.782
Hold on, Top!

01:10:38.353 --> 01:10:40.311
Shit!

01:10:45.902 --> 01:10:48.654
Top! Top! You all right?

01:10:48.738 --> 01:10:50.778
My leg.

01:10:51.867 --> 01:10:53.906
- Can you walk?
- I don't know.

01:10:53.994 --> 01:10:56.034
Oh, shit!

01:11:02.002 --> 01:11:05.786
<i>Looks like the rebreather
punched a hole through the ice. </i>

01:11:06.883 --> 01:11:08.921
Yeah.

01:11:11.845 --> 01:11:13.885
Smells like methane.

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:00.590
Some kind of killing ground.

01:12:02.063 --> 01:12:04.268
It's just like Nicolai's mosaic legend.

01:12:04.356 --> 01:12:07.476
That means there's gotta be
an opening close by.

01:12:20.206 --> 01:12:21.914
Top! Tyler!

01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:34.220
- You see the light?
- Yeah.

01:12:34.303 --> 01:12:37.470
There's cold water coming up.
That's the way out of here.

01:12:37.556 --> 01:12:41.637
- I think you're right.
- It must have been a dry passage.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:48.526
Jack? Jack?

01:12:49.695 --> 01:12:52.731
Jack, what's happening? Top?

01:12:52.823 --> 01:12:56.107
What's going on?

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.445
Jack.

01:13:07.254 --> 01:13:09.661
You two get out of here.
I'm going back for them.

01:13:09.756 --> 01:13:12.461
You're in no condition. Top can barely walk.

01:13:12.551 --> 01:13:15.551
- I'm the one that has to go.
- Put your gear on and get in the water.

01:13:15.637 --> 01:13:18.211
I'm not getting in the water.
You're not going back.

01:13:19.183 --> 01:13:20.641
Mac, whoa! Whoa!

01:13:24.103 --> 01:13:26.012
He's right.

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:33.313
Now, come on, Jack.
You led us here. You were right.

01:13:35.323 --> 01:13:38.527
But I'm doing this now. I'm going back for them.

01:13:49.963 --> 01:13:53.498
This is the way. We walk until it opens up again.

01:14:05.353 --> 01:14:08.308
Run. Run!

01:14:42.682 --> 01:14:45.434
Shit, we got company.
He must have followed us here.

01:14:51.692 --> 01:14:53.566
<i>This thing has got to have a weakness. </i>

01:14:53.653 --> 01:14:56.523
<i>Everything's got a weakness. 
Where is it?</i>

01:14:56.614 --> 01:14:58.488
It's moving.

01:15:00.034 --> 01:15:00.982
<i>Top!</i>

01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:13.911
It took one of the rebreathers.

01:15:15.007 --> 01:15:16.916
He's playing with us.

01:16:07.935 --> 01:16:09.975
Kathryn!

01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:13.559
Briggs!

01:16:22.493 --> 01:16:24.863
<i>Help!</i>

01:16:26.412 --> 01:16:28.535
- Briggs!
- Help!

01:16:28.623 --> 01:16:31.114
Briggs!

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:32.667
No, no!

01:16:32.752 --> 01:16:35.326
- Come on!
- No!

01:16:35.422 --> 01:16:36.667
Come on!

01:16:36.756 --> 01:16:38.583
Tyler!

01:16:38.675 --> 01:16:39.920
Shit!

01:16:42.345 --> 01:16:44.303
Help!

01:17:09.748 --> 01:17:10.993
<i>Tyler. </i>

01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:15.574
Briggs.

01:17:18.089 --> 01:17:19.797
Kathryn.

01:17:19.882 --> 01:17:21.342
Where?

01:17:32.897 --> 01:17:36.480
Sorry. Go.

01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:39.105
<i>- Go. 
- No.</i>

01:17:39.195 --> 01:17:40.392
Briggs!

01:18:05.429 --> 01:18:07.302
Shit.

01:18:21.695 --> 01:18:22.442
Tyler.

01:18:25.074 --> 01:18:27.944
Are you all right? What happened?

01:18:28.035 --> 01:18:30.242
- Why did they leave?
- Sound waves.

01:18:30.329 --> 01:18:32.821
They retreat from the pulse. Doesn't last long.

01:18:32.915 --> 01:18:36.782
- We found a way out.
- Jack was right.

01:18:36.877 --> 01:18:39.415
And the others? Briggs?

01:18:40.965 --> 01:18:44.000
No, no. He didn't make it.

01:18:44.927 --> 01:18:47.597
- Where's Kim?
- I don't know. We got separated.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.922
Shit!

01:18:50.016 --> 01:18:52.721
All right, come on. This way.

01:19:11.912 --> 01:19:13.537
This is it. You ready?

01:19:14.623 --> 01:19:17.909
<i>- You can make it. 
- Yeah.</i>

01:19:22.716 --> 01:19:23.913
All right.

01:19:31.849 --> 01:19:33.888
Let's go.

01:19:33.976 --> 01:19:36.016
Don't be scared. It's gonna be fine.

01:19:44.404 --> 01:19:46.028
Watch your head.

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.572
Tyler!

01:19:51.285 --> 01:19:53.324
<i>We've gotta go under. </i>

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:31.800
Come on, Kathryn. Breathe.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.930
Are you all right?

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:05.708
- Alex!
- We gotta go. They're coming this way!

01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:11.752
- Look, I can't go back in the water.
- Come on.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:16.055
The way out's next to an ice vein.
This has to connect to the other one. Let's go.

01:22:29.904 --> 01:22:30.899
All right.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:56.343
They gotta be here somewhere.

01:22:58.558 --> 01:23:00.514
But where?

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:04.520
Jack, Top.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.645
Quiet.

01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:08.772
Kill your light.

01:23:14.824 --> 01:23:16.615
Where's Briggs?

01:23:21.748 --> 01:23:23.787
They're watching us.

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.868
They see with sound.

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.533
And the steam, it's confusing them.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:31.999
They took one of our rebreathers,
but they've left us alone since.

01:23:32.091 --> 01:23:35.377
- They're waiting on something.
- There were more right behind us.

01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:39.053
We should get in the water now.

01:23:39.141 --> 01:23:41.762
Look. This works for a while.

01:23:41.852 --> 01:23:46.596
We have to split out the tanks, the air and
oxygen. Won't last long, but it's our only choice.

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:53.317
We need the other rebreather, Tyler.

01:24:00.287 --> 01:24:01.946
You see it there?

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:05.324
<i>- Yeah. 
- I'm going for it. You get the rest in the water. </i>

01:24:07.294 --> 01:24:08.492
OK.

01:24:09.546 --> 01:24:11.787
<i>Top, start breaking down that unit. </i>

01:24:13.007 --> 01:24:15.545
<i>Kathryn, you and Alex buddy-breathe
from the air tank. </i>

01:24:15.635 --> 01:24:18.589
Top, that's gonna leave you with the oxygen.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.719
<i>- No regulator. 
- Cool.</i>

01:24:29.065 --> 01:24:30.181
Jack!

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.691
I'll cover you with the mapping gun.

01:24:41.786 --> 01:24:44.159
All right, let's go. Let's get out of here.

01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:26.576
<i>Let's go! Come on!</i>

01:25:47.102 --> 01:25:48.016
Alex!

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.403
Oh!

01:26:40.823 --> 01:26:43.315
<i>Tyler!
- Tyler!</i>

01:27:16.025 --> 01:27:16.891
Jack!

01:27:30.248 --> 01:27:32.371
Tyler, behind us!

01:27:32.459 --> 01:27:33.372
Tyler!

01:27:46.222 --> 01:27:49.092
<i>Jack, there's another one!</i>

01:27:54.731 --> 01:27:56.391
Jack, no!

01:28:00.362 --> 01:28:01.477
Go!

01:28:07.577 --> 01:28:09.819
Jack! Get in the water!

01:28:17.588 --> 01:28:19.544
Come on, mother...

01:28:27.974 --> 01:28:29.171
No!

01:29:51.598 --> 01:29:54.089
You gonna be OK, Tyler?
- Yeah.

01:29:55.185 --> 01:29:57.511
Take care of yourself, man.

01:30:00.775 --> 01:30:02.814
Bye, Kathryn.

01:30:08.616 --> 01:30:11.570
- Travel safe, OK?
- All right.

01:30:34.726 --> 01:30:36.765
Tyler?

01:30:36.853 --> 01:30:39.142
I'm sorry.

01:30:39.231 --> 01:30:41.519
You're thinking about him.

01:30:41.607 --> 01:30:43.350
Yeah.

01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:53.490
You said that parasite was changing him.

01:30:53.578 --> 01:30:57.658
I mean, he never could have
survived out here, could he?

01:31:03.338 --> 01:31:07.667
At first... I thought it could only survive
in a cave environment.

01:31:09.718 --> 01:31:12.008
But now I'm not so sure.

01:31:17.727 --> 01:31:20.301
I think it wants to get out.

01:31:25.778 --> 01:31:26.857
No.

01:31:30.866 --> 01:31:31.980
Excuse me.

01:31:44.254 --> 01:31:45.583
