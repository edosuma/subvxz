with the--

00:35.960 --> 00:37.160
Don't ask.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.280
Stig's not
taking off the bag

00:39.280 --> 00:42.000
until you can accept
him for who he is.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.080
Yeah, a psycho!

00:45.400 --> 00:48.000
You're not making
points this way.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.040
And you're not getting in the
Midnight Society this week,

00:51.040 --> 00:53.680
'cause Kiki's up,
so take it off.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.000
Stig says go ahead.
He can wait.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.720
Go on, Kik.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.470
OK.

01:01.480 --> 01:04.680
I got my idea
from a book on symbols.

01:04.680 --> 01:06.480
Like in a band?
Ha ha.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.760
Short book!

01:07.760 --> 01:09.920
No, slick. Symbols.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.560
Like signs,

01:11.560 --> 01:13.120
drawings.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.920
It showed how
ancient Egyptians

01:14.920 --> 01:16.440
used symbols
to communicate.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.040
Yeah. They drew pictures
instead of letters.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.440
Exactly.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.880
So I was thinking about
how much we use symbols, too.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.440
This is a symbol.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.280
And this.

01:33.520 --> 01:34.960
Even this.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.320
We all know
what they mean...

01:38.320 --> 01:41.200
Unless you have a bag
over your head.

01:41.200 --> 01:44.120
But imagine a symbol
you've never seen before.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.640
It could mean anything.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.760
Good news...

01:54.760 --> 01:56.440
A party...

01:56.440 --> 01:58.440
Friendship...

01:58.440 --> 02:01.360
Or it could be a sign
of something else...

02:01.360 --> 02:03.360
Maybe a warning

02:03.360 --> 02:05.360
of unspeakable evil.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.880
Submitted for the approval

02:10.880 --> 02:12.880
of the Midnight Society,

02:12.880 --> 02:15.000
I call this story...

02:28.960 --> 02:30.880
<i> Everyone Claudia knew</i>

02:30.880 --> 02:34.920
<i> was doing something really
cool for summer vacation...</i>

02:34.920 --> 02:36.280
<i> Except for Claudia.</i>

02:39.280 --> 02:40.520
Claudia,
is that you?

02:40.520 --> 02:42.640
Hi, Aunt Yvonne.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.640
I almost didn't
recognize you.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.200
You're getting
way too big!

02:47.200 --> 02:49.400
<i> Spending a few weeks
with her aunt Yvonne</i>

02:49.400 --> 02:50.880

02:50.880 --> 02:52.880
<i> wasn't exactly her idea
of an exciting time.</i>

02:52.880 --> 02:54.920
How was the flight?
Were you nervous?

02:54.920 --> 02:56.920
Oh, no. I'm used to
traveling by myself.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.920
Sorry I couldn't
pick you up.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.920
It has been
a crazy morning.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.840
We have a new guest on 2,
and the boiler man's here.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.320
Never a dull moment.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.000
[Laughs]
I bet.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.960
A world traveler like you

03:09.960 --> 03:13.000
must think that scenic
vista is pretty boring.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
But we have our share
of excitement.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.520
Do you play
backgammon?

03:17.520 --> 03:18.520
Um--um--

03:18.520 --> 03:19.880
You'll learn.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.960
Let's say hi first.
Everyone's dying to meet you.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.440
Attention,
everyone.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.960
I'd like you to meet
my niece, Claudia.

03:33.400 --> 03:37.440
'Bout time we had
some new blood around here.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.360
We have the bridge club
and gardening club

03:42.360 --> 03:43.840
and bingo on Fridays.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.360
Uh, Aunt Yvonne,

03:45.360 --> 03:48.440
I know this is a place for
old people and everything,

03:48.440 --> 03:50.400
but, I mean,
am I the only--

03:50.400 --> 03:52.840
Oh! The boiler man! I
forgot all about him!

03:52.840 --> 03:55.960
Your room's in there.
I'll be back in a sec.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.320
Pretty hair.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.440
Such pretty hair.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.720
I once had hair like
that, too, you know.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.800
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to--

04:32.800 --> 04:34.760
Claudia, it's OK.

04:34.760 --> 04:37.280
Marjorie,
this is my niece.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.280
She'll be staying
with us for a while.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.360
How nice.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.480
You 2 can have
a chat later.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.200
<i> [Music stops]</i>

04:50.040 --> 04:51.800
Is she OK?

04:51.800 --> 04:53.320
Oh, sure.

04:53.320 --> 04:56.480
She just gets confused
once in a while.

<i> ¶¶¶</i>

05:03.080 --> 05:06.080
go on! Eat the Brussels
sprouts, I told him.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.080
But don't say
I didn't warn you

05:09.080 --> 05:11.080
when the gas starts
acting up!

05:11.080 --> 05:14.080
Aunty Yvonne, are there
any, like, younger people

05:14.080 --> 05:16.160
staying here?

05:16.160 --> 05:19.880
Hmm. Well, Ralph
Krieger's only 67.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.760
I know what you mean.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.760
There's a girl next door
named Kate,

05:25.760 --> 05:27.760
and I told her
you were coming.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.040
Thanks, Aunt Yvonne.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.080
Hi.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.760
Do you wanna
play baseball?

05:34.760 --> 05:37.680
I really hope
you're not Kate.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.880
No, I'm Kate.
That's Nikki.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.560
Hi, I'm Claudia.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.400
Hi. Your aunt told me
you were coming.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.440
Your parents
went on a trip?

05:45.440 --> 05:48.280
Yeah, to South America.
I got dumped here.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.280
South America?
Cool!

05:49.280 --> 05:51.280
They travel all over
for work.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.280
They're botanists. You know,
studying plants and stuff.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.960
That's so great! Do
you ever go with them?

05:56.960 --> 05:58.160
Um, sometimes--

05:58.160 --> 05:59.800
Come on, let's play.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.960
Later. I want to
talk to Claudia.

06:02.960 --> 06:05.440
Nothing exciting
ever happens around here.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.960
Same old, same old.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.200
Yeah. My aunt's place is
kinda like old folks central.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.240
I know. I help out
there sometimes.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.240
Did Mr. Duncan
talk about his gas yet?

06:15.240 --> 06:17.240
As a matter of fact,
yeah.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.240
There's lots of
woods around here.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.240
Are there any good
hiking trails?

06:21.240 --> 06:24.720
Are you kidding? That's all
there is. You wanna see?

06:24.720 --> 06:25.880
Yeah!

06:41.320 --> 06:43.720
It's not exactly
the Amazon.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.720
No, it's great. I love
being in the woods.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.240
What's over
that way?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.720
Nothing.
Just some more woods.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.240
Let's check it out
then.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.320
Come on.

06:53.320 --> 06:56.360
We shouldn't go too far
from the path.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.040
Whoa!

07:03.040 --> 07:05.120
Just don't look down.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.680
Don't look down.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.440
<i> [Laughter]</i>

07:14.240 --> 07:16.200
What's so funny?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.680
What?

07:17.680 --> 07:19.200
Why are you laughing?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.680
I'm not.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.800
Maybe we should
go back.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.680
Whoa!

07:37.600 --> 07:40.280
<i>What is this?</i>

07:40.280 --> 07:42.280
Let's go, OK?

07:42.280 --> 07:43.800
But what's that symbol?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.320
You'll think
it's silly.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.680
Try me.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.680
People say
this used to be

07:49.680 --> 07:51.760
some kind of ancient
burial ground.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.040
Cool!

07:53.040 --> 07:55.680
And something bad
happened here years ago.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.200
Someone was murdered.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.080
No way. Really?

07:59.080 --> 08:02.360
Yeah. And apparently, that
sign just appeared overnight.

08:02.360 --> 08:04.040
But... what's it mean?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.640
Everyone calls it
the Jagged Sign.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.840
They say it's the
mark of the dead man.

08:11.840 --> 08:12.960
Ooh!

08:14.200 --> 08:15.640
I love it!

08:15.640 --> 08:18.160
And if you stare
at it too long,

08:18.160 --> 08:21.160
you wake the ghost,
and it possesses you.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.640
Lemme guess. Then it lures
you up to fall to your doom,

08:24.640 --> 08:25.640
right?

08:25.640 --> 08:28.040
Uh, yeah. Something
like that.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.200
Where you going?

08:30.200 --> 08:32.520
I wanna go up
and check it out.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.679
I don't think
you should.

08:34.679 --> 08:38.240
Why not? You don't believe
in that ghost stuff, do you?

08:38.240 --> 08:40.960
Well, no, but I'm sorta
scared of heights.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.880
So I'll go myself.

08:42.880 --> 08:43.919
Don't!

08:43.919 --> 08:46.640
I don't think
there's a way up.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.880
Yeah?

08:47.880 --> 08:50.520
<i>Then how'd he
get up there?</i>

08:50.520 --> 08:51.640
Don't look at him!

08:51.640 --> 08:53.760
What? Why?!

08:53.760 --> 08:55.240
It's the ghost!

08:58.640 --> 09:00.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Kate, Kate.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.000
I thought you didn't
believe in that stuff.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.480
I lied.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.280
It was probably some high
school guy from around here.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.280
We'll go back, and--

09:22.680 --> 09:23.920
Claudia!

09:26.760 --> 09:27.960
Aah!

09:32.160 --> 09:33.120
Kate, just relax, OK?

09:33.120 --> 09:34.480
He didn't follow us.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.400
Where'd he come from?
How'd he get down so fast?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.600
I don't know. We
should have asked him.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.840
Forget it!

09:40.840 --> 09:43.560
Oh, be real. I don't
believe in ghosts.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.560
Aah!

09:44.560 --> 09:45.640
Whoa, sorry!

09:45.640 --> 09:48.400
I'm going into town.
I won't be long.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.800
Oh, uh, Aunt Yvonne.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.120
Claudia! Do you
know anything about--

09:53.120 --> 09:54.720
What?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.320
What's
the matter?

09:56.320 --> 09:59.120
Do you know anything about that
Jagged Sign thing in the woods?

09:59.120 --> 10:01.240
Kate, did you take
her up there?

10:01.240 --> 10:03.920
Uh, yeah, sorta.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.880
I don't want you girls
out there.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.920
Why? You don't think it's
really haunted, do you?

10:08.920 --> 10:10.400
Of course not.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.880
But that cliff's
dangerous,

10:11.880 --> 10:15.000

10:22.680 --> 10:24.760
Marjorie, no!

10:27.200 --> 10:29.120
I was just making
some soup,

10:29.120 --> 10:32.120
and then all of a
sudden, all this smoke.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.640
I'm sorry, Yvonne.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.120
Oh, I'm so sorry!

10:35.120 --> 10:37.120
It's OK, Marjorie.
It's OK.

10:37.120 --> 10:40.160
Now you go on. We'll
take care of this.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.640

10:41.640 --> 10:43.040
[Sobs]
Oh...Oh...

10:45.200 --> 10:48.960
Oh... this kind of thing
is happening more and more.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.160
I can't watch her
every minute!

10:51.160 --> 10:52.760
We'll help
clean up.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.360
No. Thanks.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.680
I'll do it.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.480
Just do me a favor and
stay close to the house.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.000

about you, too.

over.

Is the sign
still there?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.920
No. It disappeared.
But I drew this.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.880
You're not supposed
to look at it.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.440
I don't believe
in curses.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.320
Well, you didn't believe
in ghosts, either.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.400
I'm going back
to the cliff.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.280
Are you with me?

12:51.280 --> 12:53.080
No!
Your aunt said--

12:53.080 --> 12:56.520
You wanted something exciting to
happen around here. This is it.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.880

It's not him. It's the
cliff. That place is hairy.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.480
Well, maybe you're afraid
of heights, but I'm not.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.520
Girls.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.240
Can I see you for a sec?

13:16.040 --> 13:18.600
I just spoke
to Marjorie's nephew,

13:18.600 --> 13:20.920
and he agreed
that it's best

13:20.920 --> 13:24.560
to move her someplace where
they can look after her properly.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.080
You mean like
a rest home.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.680
Someplace with
medical care.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.360
Her health
is really failing.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.880
That's so sad.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.600
Yeah. She's been here
a long time.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.080
Anyhow, I need help packing
up some of her things

13:40.080 --> 13:42.080
to go to
the thrift shop.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.960
You 2 didn't have any
plans for the day, did you?

14:04.680 --> 14:06.280
Excuse me, Marjorie.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.080
I just wanted
to make sure

14:13.080 --> 14:15.600
you meant to
give this away.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.720
Oh...

14:16.720 --> 14:19.120
I know it's old
and everything, but...

14:19.120 --> 14:22.040
I thought it might have some
kind of sentimental value

14:22.040 --> 14:23.720
or something.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.120
Oh!

14:36.600 --> 14:38.280
Whoa!

15:00.120 --> 15:02.120
Eew, gross!

15:02.120 --> 15:03.120
Oh...

15:03.120 --> 15:05.240
Whaddaya know?

15:05.240 --> 15:07.560
An old love knot.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.240
A love knot?

15:10.240 --> 15:11.560
Oh... ladies used to

15:11.560 --> 15:13.560
tie up a lock
of their hair

15:13.560 --> 15:15.600
and give it to
their boyfriends.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.280
It was a sign
of undying love.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.920
Eew!

15:23.920 --> 15:27.920
Marjorie had beautiful strawberry
blonde hair when she was young.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.480
You mean like
Claudia's?

15:29.480 --> 15:30.880
Uh-huh.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.880
I saw a picture
of her.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.840
She looked very much
like Claudia.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.120
Here it is.
Right here.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.080
Who's the guy?

15:43.560 --> 15:47.280
I don't know.
Must be her Beau.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.000
Hello?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Hey!

15:59.080 --> 16:00.520
Where are you?

16:04.240 --> 16:06.520
Marjorie,
can I come in?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.400
Marjorie,
who is this?

16:16.080 --> 16:16.800
Ohh...

16:18.080 --> 16:19.520
Joshua.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.760
How I must have
hurt you.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.000
But I couldn't
help it.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.840
Wait!

16:29.840 --> 16:31.640
Don't move.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.480
Joshua and I were
hoping to be married,

16:39.480 --> 16:42.480
but we knew our parents
would never allow it

16:42.480 --> 16:45.480
because we were
so young.

16:45.480 --> 16:48.480
So we decided
to elope.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.960
We were going to meet at our
secret place in the woods.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.960
Wait. Marjorie...

16:54.960 --> 16:56.960
Where was
your secret place?

16:56.960 --> 16:58.960
The cliff.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.440
We were going to meet
at the foot of the cliff.

17:14.560 --> 17:17.480
My parents
discovered our plan

17:17.480 --> 17:20.319
and prevented me
from meeting him.

17:22.480 --> 17:27.400
He died believing
that I chose not to come...

17:27.400 --> 17:30.400
When it was because
they wouldn't let me.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.920
He died?

17:31.920 --> 17:33.920
What happened?

17:33.920 --> 17:36.440
He always used to say

17:36.440 --> 17:41.440
he wanted the whole world
to know how much he loved me.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.440
So...

17:43.440 --> 17:46.440
He climbed up
on the ledge

17:46.440 --> 17:49.440
to draw the symbol
of our love

17:49.440 --> 17:52.040
for everyone to see.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.080
But the ledge
is dangerous,

17:56.080 --> 17:58.920
and before
he could finish,

17:58.920 --> 18:01.080
he fell.

18:04.520 --> 18:06.920
Before he could
finish.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.200
I never loved
anyone else!

18:11.200 --> 18:13.360
And he died

18:13.360 --> 18:15.520
thinking
I rejected him.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.440
Marjorie...

18:17.440 --> 18:19.320
Can I borrow this?

18:28.760 --> 18:31.120
Excuse me.
Has anyone seen Claudia?

18:31.120 --> 18:34.600
I did. Ran out a few minutes
ago like a Jack Rabbit.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.880
Where'd she go?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.640
Seems like she was
heading for the woods.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.280
The woods!

18:42.000 --> 18:45.600
Hey! We need
a fourth for bridge.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.680
Claudia!

19:21.960 --> 19:23.080
Hello?

19:23.080 --> 19:25.960
Hey, where are you?

19:26.960 --> 19:28.840
[Rock falls]

19:34.640 --> 19:36.000
Aah!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.360
Aah!

19:40.920 --> 19:41.880
Claudia?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.000
Kate!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.720
Help!

19:44.720 --> 19:45.760
Claudia!

19:45.760 --> 19:47.240
Kate, hurry!

19:49.400 --> 19:50.600
Kate, help!

20:09.480 --> 20:10.920
Kate, hurry!

20:10.920 --> 20:12.840
Hurry, Kate!

20:17.880 --> 20:18.880
Aah!

20:40.840 --> 20:42.880
Just don't look down.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.440
Don't look down.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.480
Kate, hurry!

20:54.480 --> 20:56.440
Claudia, I can't!

20:58.440 --> 20:59.680
Aah!

21:09.520 --> 21:10.440
Kate!

21:10.440 --> 21:12.120
Hurry!

21:27.880 --> 21:28.960
Look!

21:31.040 --> 21:33.480
Who are you?
What do you want?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.760
I waited for you,
Marjorie.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.640
Why did you take so long
to come? Don't you love me?

21:40.640 --> 21:43.320
What's he talking
about?

21:43.320 --> 21:45.320
She's not Marjorie,
Joshua.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.040
Marjorie couldn't come.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.880
Her parents
stopped her.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.160
He thinks
I'm Marjorie?

21:55.920 --> 21:58.320
She kept this all
these years, Joshua,

21:58.320 --> 22:00.840
as a sign of
her love for you

22:00.840 --> 22:02.840
just like the sign
you never finished.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.480
She still loves me?

22:04.480 --> 22:08.120
Yes, Joshua.
You should go to her.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.360
What happened?

22:20.360 --> 22:23.720
He finished what he
started a long time ago.

22:29.840 --> 22:30.800
[Gasps]

22:30.800 --> 22:32.120
Look!

22:41.840 --> 22:44.640
<i> Marjorie passed away
that very afternoon.</i>

22:44.640 --> 22:47.800
<i> Everyone said how peaceful
she looked at the end,</i>

22:47.800 --> 22:50.800
<i> even happy.</i>

22:50.800 --> 22:55.680
<i> They all thought it was because
she was going on to a better place,</i>

22:55.680 --> 22:57.680
<i> but only Claudia
and Kate knew</i>

22:57.680 --> 22:59.880
<i> just how true that was.</i>

23:09.320 --> 23:10.960
The end.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.080
Good story.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.640
What do you think,
Stig?

23:15.360 --> 23:17.200
He says
he can't breathe.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.520
What?!

23:20.720 --> 23:23.360
I'm going next time. This
bag thing ain't making it.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.720
All right.
Stig's up next,

23:24.720 --> 23:26.600
and we'll take
a final vote

23:26.600 --> 23:28.640
of whether he
gets in or not.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.320
Sorry.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.120
You're not in yet.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.440
Keep the bandanna.
