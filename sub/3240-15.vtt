We're looking for the person
who fingerprinted him.

That you are
on urkesh soil, doctor?

If we could just talk
to the person who takes
the fingerprints...

33:09.788 --> 33:12.122
And who killed the heir
to the throne of urkesh.

But until we find
your father's murderer --

I haven't done anything.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.773
You're wrong, princess.
