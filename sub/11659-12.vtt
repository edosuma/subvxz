00:56.533 --> 00:59.734
If you didn't like the dress,
you should've told me.

00:59.800 --> 01:01.233
I was being helpful.

01:01.300 --> 01:05.967
Asking if it had a "wide load" sign
is not being helpful.

01:07.300 --> 01:10.133
I will never ever take you
shopping with me again.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.333
Fine.
I'll shop by myself.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.700
Then I can pee
when I'm good and ready.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.767
Dorothy, you found a dress
for the banquet.

01:22.834 --> 01:25.900
Do you just adore it?

01:25.967 --> 01:28.734
Could you throw yourself down
and die for it?

01:28.800 --> 01:31.934
It's a dress, Blanche.
It's not the Alamo.

01:32.967 --> 01:36.734
It took you five weeks to find it.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.700
That's because I'm hard to fit.

01:38.767 --> 01:41.333
I can see that. I'm not blind.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.166
I didn't mean anything by that.

01:46.233 --> 01:49.433
I tend to fall
between sizes myself.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.867
-I'm smack-dab between a 4--
-And a 16.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.967
Hi, girls.

01:59.033 --> 02:01.934
Is that your dress
for the museum fund raiser?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.333
-Uh-huh.
-Let's see it.

02:03.400 --> 02:07.133
All right,
but it is very simple.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.533
Well, what do you think?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.967
You're my best friend,
so let's change the subject.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.200
It's exactly
what I would have picked.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.433
It goes back tomorrow.

02:26.266 --> 02:27.734
What are you wearing, Blanche?

02:27.800 --> 02:31.600
I'll grab some dazzling number
from my closet

02:31.667 --> 02:34.934
that these people
haven't been privileged to see.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.200
Maybe the red sequined,
strapless, backless mini.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.100
Just tie a scarf
around your waist.

02:44.066 --> 02:45.433
Oh, Ma, good news.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.934
They changed the flavor
of Haley's M.O.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.667
-I'm taking the dress back.
-So?

02:52.734 --> 02:54.967
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

02:55.033 --> 02:59.734
I really would like you
to help me find a dress.

03:00.233 --> 03:04.934
I was there when you
needed a communion dress

03:05.000 --> 03:07.266
and a prom dress.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.767
I was there for you when you needed
a wedding dress.

03:09.834 --> 03:13.166
I'm sick of it.
Buy your own damn dress.

03:16.967 --> 03:18.767
I'll be over at Mildred's.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.934
Rose Nylund?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.200
No. If I start acting like her,
pull the plug.

03:27.633 --> 03:28.867
Rose Nylund.

03:28.934 --> 03:30.734
43 years.
I'd know you anywhere.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.934
Are you...
You're not... Could you be...

03:34.000 --> 03:35.633
Buddy Rourke.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.367
Buddy Rourke!

03:37.433 --> 03:41.700
Oh, Blanche, Dorothy,
it's Buddy Rourke! Come in.

03:41.767 --> 03:45.233
These are my best friends,
Dorothy and Blanche.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.934
-Hello there.
-After all these years!

03:49.000 --> 03:51.266
You don't know who he is,
do you, Rose?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.533
Haven't a clue.

03:55.567 --> 03:58.934
Don't be embarrassed.
We never met before.

04:00.467 --> 04:03.100
Then exactly how would you
have known her anywhere?

04:03.166 --> 04:05.233
Charlie always talked about her.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.200
You knew Charlie?
Please sit down.

04:08.266 --> 04:11.800
I served with your husband
in the war. 82nd Airborne.

04:11.867 --> 04:16.867
Fort Bragg to Nottingham
to Normandy and back.

04:16.934 --> 04:19.834
Charlie was one
of the finest men I ever met.

04:20.333 --> 04:24.333
I often wondered
why he put up with me.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.500
Sorry I didn't know you.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.567
Charlie didn't talk
about the war.

04:28.633 --> 04:32.166
I'd always hoped Charlie and I
would hook up again one day,

04:32.233 --> 04:37.734
but I never had the occasion
to visit St. Olaf.

04:37.800 --> 04:42.066
Really? Not even to change
planes for St. Gustav?

04:42.133 --> 04:45.300
You can't get to
St. Gustav by plane.

04:45.367 --> 04:46.967
You have to go by toboggan.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.734
Of course, traveling in the summer

04:50.800 --> 04:53.500
is really rough on the hiney.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.500
But it's a great way to rack up
lots of frequent-tobogganer mileage.

05:04.033 --> 05:08.500
It's amazing. How did you find Rose
after all this time?

05:08.567 --> 05:12.233
From Charlie's
army pension records.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.734
I realized a lifetime had passed,

05:14.800 --> 05:17.834
and I'd never met
my old chum's favorite girl,

05:17.900 --> 05:22.166
so I promised myself
if I was ever in the area,

05:22.233 --> 05:23.667
I'd pay my respects.

05:23.734 --> 05:26.400
Would you like to stay for dinner?

05:26.467 --> 05:29.100
I'm making sweet
and sour smelt kebabs.

05:30.633 --> 05:33.333
Smelt kebabs?
Darn, I had them for lunch.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.000
Me too.

05:36.066 --> 05:38.233
They served them
on the plane...

05:41.834 --> 05:44.500
and I'm awfully tired.

05:44.567 --> 05:48.533
I was hoping you might let me
invite you to lunch tomorrow.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.400
-If you're free.
-That would be wonderful.

05:51.467 --> 05:54.367
I'd like to show you Miami.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.834
-Pick you up around noon.
-Great.

05:56.900 --> 05:59.100
Ladies, it's been a pleasure.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.633
-Nice meeting you.
-Likewise.

06:01.934 --> 06:06.200
Rose, you're as lovely as
the picture Charlie carried.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.800
See you tomorrow.

06:10.934 --> 06:14.467
-What a sweet man!
-Absolutely charming.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.300
He obviously idolized your Charlie.

06:17.367 --> 06:21.133
More importantly,
he wasn't wearing a wedding ring.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.867
Blanche, don't be silly.

06:22.934 --> 06:25.900
I noticed it
when he gave me the eye.

06:27.734 --> 06:32.000
Have you ever met a man
you didn't think gave you the eye?

06:32.066 --> 06:34.700
Once in 1976.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.166
But it was two days later

06:36.233 --> 06:39.467
that Jimmy Carter
announced to America

06:39.533 --> 06:41.900
he had secretly lusted in his heart.

06:51.266 --> 06:53.300
You can't be serious.

06:53.367 --> 06:55.467
Charlie read you every
one of my letters?

06:55.533 --> 06:57.100
Well, selected passages.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.367
He selfishly kept the more
intimate sections to himself.

07:00.433 --> 07:01.567
One please.

07:01.633 --> 07:03.934
I used to write him every Sunday
right after church.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.300
That way, I'd have all
the latest gossip around town.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.100
Oh, he read me the gossip.

07:08.166 --> 07:12.000
In fact, I remember
there was some kind of a scandal.

07:12.066 --> 07:13.800
With a neighbor, I think.

07:13.867 --> 07:17.066
The name was, let's see,
thank you.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.734
Fenneis Wigler.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.433
I can't believe
you remember that.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.934
Well, in all fairness, Fenneis
Wigler is a hard name to forget.

07:25.000 --> 07:25.900
Oh, I know what you mean

07:25.967 --> 07:28.100
the Wiglers were
a very revered family.

07:28.166 --> 07:30.233
Yeah, until the scandal.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.500
Oh, it was just terrible.

07:33.567 --> 07:34.900
The navy came to town

07:34.967 --> 07:38.100
to take bids for
a big submarine contract

07:38.166 --> 07:40.166
they said they
wanted three submarines

07:40.233 --> 07:42.200
built for around million dollars.

07:42.266 --> 07:45.734
Well, Fenneis said he could
make a 100 for half the money.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.300
So of course,
he got the contract.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.467
Then the navy came back to check
on the progress six months later

07:51.533 --> 07:55.533
they discovered there had been
a terrible misunderstanding.

07:55.600 --> 08:01.400
Fenneis had made a hundred
hoagie heroes for $500,000.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.967
He claimed the reason
they were so expensive

08:05.033 --> 08:07.734
was he had used all imported
meats and cheeses.

08:09.667 --> 08:12.133
You know
that story still tickles me.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.934
Just as much as the first time
Charlie told it to me.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.533
It amazes me you know so much
about my life with Charlie.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.467
Rose...

08:23.767 --> 08:27.433
I don't think you realize
how very much you meant to him.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.600
Or... how very much
you meant to me.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.066
To you?
I don't understand.

08:33.133 --> 08:36.633
I didn't have a wife
or sweetheart back home,

08:36.700 --> 08:39.834
and when Charlie would
read me your letters,

08:39.900 --> 08:43.900
I felt like someone cared.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.734
That meant a lot to me.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.133
I spent a long time

08:48.200 --> 08:52.433
searching for someone
exactly like Rose Nylund.

08:53.467 --> 08:56.834
I never found her,
and now I know why.

08:58.734 --> 09:01.400
There's no one
exactly like Rose Nylund.

09:01.467 --> 09:02.800
Oh, Buddy.

09:02.867 --> 09:06.600
Charlie carried those letters
in his jacket through the war.

09:07.100 --> 09:10.967
I carry them in my heart...
for a lifetime.

09:12.367 --> 09:15.000
I think I fell in love
with the woman who wrote them.

09:33.100 --> 09:37.467
-Dorothy, show me that dress.
-Be right there.

09:37.533 --> 09:41.800
If you hurry up,
I can give you an honest opinion,

09:41.867 --> 09:44.934
and you can still return it
before the mall closes tonight.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.767
Well, ma,
what do you think?

09:52.834 --> 09:55.900
Pussycat, you look sensational.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.300
You really think so, Ma?

09:57.367 --> 09:59.800
I've never seen you
look so beautiful.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.233
Thanks, Ma.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.734
Who's the designer?

10:02.800 --> 10:05.200
He deserves a Nobel prize
for miracles.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.066
Why do I even ask you?

10:09.133 --> 10:12.166
I'll tell you
whether you ask me or not.

10:12.233 --> 10:15.633
-The sleeves are too long.
-I'll ask Rose to shorten them.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.667
If you can find her.

10:16.734 --> 10:17.867
Since that guy hit town,

10:17.934 --> 10:20.533
she spends her time
polishing his shillelagh.

10:22.433 --> 10:25.400
Ma, Rose and Buddy
are just friends.

10:25.467 --> 10:29.367
Sure. And Michael Jackson was
born with that cleft in his chin.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.066
(Blanche) Girls!

10:35.133 --> 10:39.300
Wait until you see the number
I bought for the museum banquet.

10:39.367 --> 10:41.033
Here I come!

10:46.233 --> 10:48.967
-I don't believe it.
-It can't be.

10:49.033 --> 10:52.900
Buy one for Rose
and go as the pointer sisters.

10:56.667 --> 10:59.100
I thought you were going to wear
something out of your closet.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.400
Well, I was but as it
turned out nothing fit me.

11:02.467 --> 11:03.834
Well, what did you expect
Blanche,

11:03.900 --> 11:06.400
last weekend you ate so many
pudding pops

11:06.467 --> 11:09.300
you could have built
the Eiffel tower from the sticks.

11:10.033 --> 11:11.967
That is not what I meant.

11:12.033 --> 11:14.266
I meant everything
just hangs on me.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.433
Of course, it does, that's why
you have to cover it with a dress.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.500
What are we going to do?

11:27.567 --> 11:29.700
We are not doing anything.

11:29.767 --> 11:32.800
I looked for this dress for a month.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.900
You have to take yours back.

11:34.967 --> 11:37.667
Be reasonable.

11:37.734 --> 11:40.633
This dress looks much better on me
than it does on you.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.867
Hi, girls.

11:42.934 --> 11:45.400
Oh, I love your dress.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.467
-I'm not taking mine back.
-I'm not taking mine back.

11:52.533 --> 11:55.166
-I need to talk to you.
-Dorothy, this is crazy.

11:55.233 --> 11:57.400
Since when do you care
how you look?

11:59.567 --> 12:02.467
Since I came down
from the Bell tower

12:02.533 --> 12:04.100
and had my hump fixed.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.066
Buddy's going back
to Boston on Saturday.

12:10.133 --> 12:15.233
People expect to see me
in a sensational dress.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.867
What do they expect
to see me in?

12:16.934 --> 12:18.900
A yarmulke and a hefty bag?

12:20.266 --> 12:23.567
He wants me to live with him.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.333
And I think I might.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.967
Rose, honey, you can't be serious.

12:41.033 --> 12:43.100
-Why not?
-You hardly know the man.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.133
I feel like I've known him
all my life.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.133
I talk to him about Charlie.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.233
I talk to him about St. Olaf.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.767
I talk to him about my family.

12:50.834 --> 12:52.633
I talk to him about
my animal friends.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.867
I talk to him about
life on the farm.

12:54.934 --> 12:56.567
If that man didn't get
a medal in the war,

12:56.633 --> 12:58.333
he sure as hell
deserves one now.

13:01.066 --> 13:02.200
(Sophia)
Wait a minute.

13:02.266 --> 13:05.767
-Did she just say, "live with him?"
-That's right, Sophia.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.900
-Not marry him, live with him.
-(All) Yes.

13:08.967 --> 13:12.800
Two World Wars,
a Polish Pope and now this.

13:15.266 --> 13:18.166
I may live to see CBS come up
with a morning show yet.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.266
I don't know what to do.

13:22.333 --> 13:26.333
I think you're rushing things,

13:26.400 --> 13:29.567
but maybe it's better
to live with Buddy

13:29.633 --> 13:32.900
than to charge full steam ahead
and marry him.

13:32.967 --> 13:34.867
No, it isn't.

13:34.934 --> 13:36.834
This is morally wrong.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.166
It is ethically offensive.
It's an out-and-out sin.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.066
Why do I feel like I just fell
through the looking glass?

13:51.333 --> 13:55.033
Blanche, how can you say
something like that?

13:55.100 --> 13:59.500
I've never lived with a man
without the benefit of marriage.

13:59.567 --> 14:00.500
Excuse me.

14:00.567 --> 14:03.200
I think you mean
you've never lived with a man

14:03.266 --> 14:05.266
without benefit of room service.

14:08.533 --> 14:11.200
It's not the same
as living with a man.

14:11.266 --> 14:16.000
Living with a man eliminates
the need for an overnight bag

14:16.066 --> 14:17.700
and a stop at the drugstore.

14:21.700 --> 14:25.967
And the need for marriage,
family, and tradition.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.367
Not to mention wedding showers,
catered affairs,

14:29.433 --> 14:32.200
the bridal registry at Burdine's.

14:33.266 --> 14:37.166
There's another side to this.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.667
If I had lived with Stan
before we got married,

14:39.734 --> 14:44.900
I could have spared us some
painful times and a bitter divorce.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.500
And possibly given birth
to reasonably attractive children.

14:55.433 --> 14:57.567
It does seem like
the right thing to do.

14:57.633 --> 14:59.500
I'm comfortable with Buddy.

14:59.567 --> 15:03.300
Everything seems so natural

15:03.367 --> 15:05.200
because he already knows
so much about me.

15:05.266 --> 15:07.633
But, Rose, do you love him?

15:07.700 --> 15:09.800
I think so.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.200
What about money?

15:11.266 --> 15:12.934
Everyone loves money.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.834
Have you talked about
financial arrangements?

15:16.900 --> 15:20.400
With marriage, you can have
a prenuptial agreement.

15:20.467 --> 15:24.333
Living together, all you can do is
steal from his wallet

15:24.400 --> 15:25.867
while he's in the shower.

15:27.900 --> 15:31.233
He insisted we keep
our finances separate.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.533
Good.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.600
Since we'll need a bigger place,

15:35.667 --> 15:39.667
he suggested I give him my half now

15:39.734 --> 15:42.934
so it'll be our place, not his,
right from the start.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
You've made up your mind.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.266
I guess I have.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.100
I feel awful about leaving you.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.100
I feel like I'm breaking up
the three musketeers.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.400
Honey, go with your heart.

15:55.467 --> 15:59.633
-We want you to be happy.
-I am happy.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.533
I want you to be happy.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.400
That's why I want you
to settle this dress business.

16:04.467 --> 16:05.867
There's nothing to settle.

16:05.934 --> 16:09.567
Now, I am wearing this dress.

16:09.633 --> 16:13.200
It deserves to be displayed
on a devastatingly beautiful body.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.367
Are you sending it to Kim Basinger?

16:19.367 --> 16:20.567
And what is that
supposed to mean?

16:20.633 --> 16:21.900
You think about it

16:21.967 --> 16:24.867
while you're inhaling
your next cheesecake.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.567
Oh!

16:27.633 --> 16:30.800
How dare she imply
that I overeat?

16:30.867 --> 16:32.633
That makes me so mad.

16:36.300 --> 16:37.633
Oh, darn!

16:37.700 --> 16:39.367
We're out of chips ahoy.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.433
I'm getting out of this girdle

16:42.500 --> 16:45.200
and going out for
some cookies and bean dip.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.667
Hell, I'll take it off in the car.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.800
Oh, Blanche.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.467
-I have something to tell you.
-What's that?

17:01.533 --> 17:03.767
-I bought a new gown.
-Oh, no.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.367
I wanted to be the nice one.

17:06.433 --> 17:08.567
I bought a new dress too.

17:11.834 --> 17:14.300
Mr. Marty's on market street?

17:14.367 --> 17:18.934
Where every dress is
a one-of-a-kind original?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.567
If these are the same,

17:20.633 --> 17:23.033
Mr. Marty will be left
with one of a kind.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.300
Oh!
Thank goodness.

17:31.367 --> 17:34.500
-Everything's all right.
-Except for one thing.

17:34.567 --> 17:35.967
What?

17:36.033 --> 17:38.367
It's about Rose and Buddy.

17:38.433 --> 17:41.166
That business of giving him money
has been bothering me.

17:41.233 --> 17:44.533
I did some checking
on Buddy Rourke.

17:44.600 --> 17:51.066
I found out he just retired after
45 years in the records department

17:51.133 --> 17:54.667
of the army pension office.

17:54.734 --> 17:55.800
I don't get it.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.967
That's how he knew
about Charlie.

17:58.033 --> 18:01.100
They never served together.
He read his file.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.333
But he knew things about Rose.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.100
He knew she came from St. Olaf.

18:06.166 --> 18:09.200
Everything else
Rose probably volunteered.

18:09.266 --> 18:11.200
A stranger says hello,

18:11.266 --> 18:13.066
and suddenly
he's hearing the story

18:13.133 --> 18:16.066
of uncle Fingerbinger's
30-pound rutabaga.

18:17.500 --> 18:21.533
This is all a scam
to bilk Rose out of money?

18:21.600 --> 18:25.500
Absolutely. It's not
the first time he's tried it.

18:25.567 --> 18:27.433
Where is Rose?

18:27.500 --> 18:31.734
She went to the bank
and then to meet Buddy.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.467
There's nothing we can do.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.400
Good Lord.

18:36.467 --> 18:39.667
(Sophia) Girls, how do you like
this spiffy little number

18:39.734 --> 18:41.667
I got for the big shindig?

18:41.734 --> 18:43.467
Oh, no!

18:47.900 --> 18:50.967
Sophia,
that's the same dress I got.

18:51.033 --> 18:52.934
Well, now you know
how it should look.

19:02.633 --> 19:05.100
-I wrote the kids about you.
-Really?

19:05.166 --> 19:10.200
Oh, not about us, about you,
about how you knew their father.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.266
They found it unbelievable.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.600
What do you mean?

19:13.667 --> 19:16.000
That you and I finally met.

19:16.066 --> 19:17.333
Oh.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.233
I thought they wouldn't believe
there were dinosaurs still around

19:20.300 --> 19:21.700
from World War II.

19:21.767 --> 19:24.467
Did Charlie ever tell you

19:24.533 --> 19:27.734
they found dinosaur bones
outside St. Olaf?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.767
-Rose--
-Karl Nickerson was teaching

19:29.834 --> 19:32.700
his German Shepherd
to bury herring bones--

19:32.767 --> 19:37.567
You haven't even mentioned
moving to Boston.

19:37.633 --> 19:39.533
Are you avoiding the subject?

19:39.600 --> 19:44.467
I can't go with you, Buddy.
It wouldn't be fair.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.400
I've given it a lot of thought.

19:47.467 --> 19:50.934
I'm not being honest with you
or with myself.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.567
Rose, we've been so happy.

19:54.633 --> 19:56.533
Oh, I am happy.

19:56.600 --> 20:01.166
Happy with the memories
of Charlie that you rekindled.

20:01.233 --> 20:04.200
Sometimes I put those
memories too far away

20:04.266 --> 20:07.467
because I'm afraid
they'll be painful.

20:07.533 --> 20:12.633
It's hardest on holidays or when
I'm lying in bed alone at night.

20:12.700 --> 20:16.333
But remembering
Charlie with you is wonderful.

20:17.767 --> 20:19.467
I'm glad I met you, Buddy...

20:21.767 --> 20:23.633
but I don't love you.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.533
I'm sorry.

20:28.100 --> 20:33.433
Listen, I went to the bank,
and I got something for you.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.734
-That's a gold watch.
-It's Charlie's gold watch.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.066
I want you to have it.

20:42.133 --> 20:45.100
This is a very expensive
piece of jewelry.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.200
Please, Buddy.

20:53.633 --> 20:56.767
I think I've taken enough
from you and Charlie already.

20:56.834 --> 20:58.500
What?

20:58.567 --> 21:00.533
Listen,
I hate emotional scenes.

21:00.600 --> 21:05.800
I'm the only Irishman in Boston who
avoids wakes and political rallies.

21:05.867 --> 21:08.200
I'm just going to run.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.900
-Buddy--
-I'll write.

21:10.967 --> 21:12.800
I will.

21:12.867 --> 21:15.033
No, I won't.
I always say that. I never do.

21:18.667 --> 21:19.967
Take care of yourself, Rose.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.633
You're
a special lady.

21:41.266 --> 21:42.900
-(knock on door)
-Ma!

21:45.533 --> 21:47.333
Ma, I need to talk to someone.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.033
Sure. Come in.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.767
I can hear Pavarotti live
from the met anytime.

21:54.066 --> 21:56.100
What's the problem?

21:56.166 --> 21:59.333
Ma, I'm upset about Rose.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.567
Me too.

22:00.633 --> 22:04.000
I thought I was finally getting
a room with some sunlight.

22:04.066 --> 22:06.834
I'm upset
we haven't told her the truth.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.767
Everything turned out all right.

22:08.834 --> 22:11.567
She didn't give him any money.

22:11.633 --> 22:15.467
-He didn't take the watch.
-She's living with a lie.

22:15.533 --> 22:18.433
So? What harm does that do?

22:18.500 --> 22:20.166
I don't know.

22:20.233 --> 22:23.767
-What's the problem?
-It doesn't seem right.

22:23.834 --> 22:27.967
Dorothy... let me tell you a story.

22:28.033 --> 22:29.133
Picture it.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.967
Sicily, 1922.

22:32.033 --> 22:35.233
A young military officer
stationed far from home.

22:35.300 --> 22:39.567
He wanders the streets seeking
a friendly face and chianti.

22:39.633 --> 22:44.266
He happens into a cafe
where he finds both.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.433
He laughs for
the first time in months

22:46.500 --> 22:48.100
and finds inspiration

22:48.166 --> 22:52.266
in a beautiful peasant girl
wise beyond her years.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.900
Cafe was closed.
She takes him home.

22:55.967 --> 23:00.333
For three glorious days,
they make love and drink wine.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.133
He returns to his command,

23:02.200 --> 23:04.967
prepared to lead people
through battle.

23:06.367 --> 23:10.500
Dorothy... that young
peasant girl was me.

23:11.934 --> 23:15.633
And that young man...
was Winston Churchill.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.100
Ma, you made
that whole thing up.

23:25.166 --> 23:26.834
Now, what is your point?

23:26.900 --> 23:29.100
That I made it up!

23:29.166 --> 23:31.734
It gave me a lot of pleasure.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.133
If Rose is happy

23:34.200 --> 23:37.000
and there was no harm done,
let her have that.

23:41.300 --> 23:42.734
You know something, Ma?

23:45.166 --> 23:46.633
You may be right.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.033
(music playing on radio)

24:00.433 --> 24:01.834
Good night, Charlie.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.066
I love you.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.633
(theme music playing)
