02:17.654 --> 02:21.325
You're seeing the Senator in an hour.
Get going, or you'll hit traffic.

02:25.796 --> 02:26.797
I'm on my way.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.832
Eyes straight ahead, Jack.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.835
Let the cops go.

03:19.516 --> 03:21.969
It's a green light, Jack.

03:22.169 --> 03:23.470
Make a right.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.478
I left something for you under your visor.

03:35.866 --> 03:38.168
What do you want me to do with this?

03:38.368 --> 03:40.370
I'll tell you when you get to your office.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.968
You pull something off the keycard?

03:54.168 --> 03:55.669
I may be close to finding your assassin.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.611
Got a name?

03:56.811 --> 03:57.554
Almost.

03:58.555 --> 03:59.940
You see this?

04:00.140 --> 04:03.177
It's a scrambled medical file referencing
a series of plastic surgeries.

04:03.377 --> 04:06.305
If it's the shooter, he's trying to
hide his identity.

04:06.505 --> 04:09.433
- Or assume someone else's.
- To get close to Palmer?

04:10.317 --> 04:12.069
Mm-hmm. Call me when you get a name.

04:13.570 --> 04:14.571
Right.

04:26.783 --> 04:28.001
Pull over.

04:32.005 --> 04:32.806
Keith.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.382
I'll flag him on the right.

04:34.582 --> 04:35.759
- Let my man get him.
- No!

04:35.959 --> 04:38.212
We're on high alert. There's a
threat on your life.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.013
- Call your man off.
- Sir!

04:40.514 --> 04:42.266
- Jimmy, stand down.
- Keith, hold up.

04:42.766 --> 04:43.567
Go away.

04:43.767 --> 04:44.685
I need to talk to you.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.887
Mom already said you're
doing all the talking.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.140
I'm gonna speak at the breakfast to
tell our side of the story.

04:50.340 --> 04:51.692
"Our side"?

04:51.892 --> 04:54.561
Before Maureen Kingsley can put it
out and spin it the wrong way.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.866
It won't matter how the story comes out.

04:59.066 --> 05:02.069
Everyone will still think I went to
go kill Gibson that night.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.289
Who's gonna believe it was an accident?

05:05.489 --> 05:07.624
I believe you, son, if you say so.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.715
Look, when your mother and I go
to this breakfast in an hour...

05:14.915 --> 05:16.550
...we want you and Nicole to come with us.

05:17.050 --> 05:17.851
Why?

05:18.051 --> 05:21.888
So you can save your campaign
by sacrificing me to CNN?

05:22.088 --> 05:25.142
So, I can stand by you, as your father.

05:27.978 --> 05:30.063
It's a little late for that.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.566
You never gave me a chance to help you.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.768
How could I? I mean, you
weren't there.

05:38.822 --> 05:42.326
You can tell yourself whatever you want...

05:42.526 --> 05:45.612
...but your career always came first.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.916
So if you expect me to stand up
in front of everyone now...

05:50.116 --> 05:51.918
...and act like we're this family...

05:54.921 --> 05:56.923
We are a family, Keith.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.768
Keith!

06:25.535 --> 06:28.789
You missed a spot. Right here,
on your neck.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.494
Rick, help me get out of here.

06:34.911 --> 06:35.912
How?

06:36.913 --> 06:38.465
This place is like a prison.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.717
People break out of prison all the time.

06:43.253 --> 06:44.588
Look...

06:45.055 --> 06:47.557
...Gaines said he'd let me go after
I buried Dan.

06:49.559 --> 06:53.980
Now, once I'm out of here, I'll call
your dad, tell him where you are.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.983
Great plan, except you're not gonna get out.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.235
Gaines won't let you go.

06:58.435 --> 07:01.405
He's got no reason to stop me.
He doesn't need me anymore.

07:01.605 --> 07:02.406
Exactly.

07:29.099 --> 07:30.651
What do you want me to do here?

07:30.851 --> 07:35.105
Replace the keycard we gave you with
the one your people are trying to decrypt.

07:36.606 --> 07:37.974
Because we're getting too close?

07:38.174 --> 07:39.476
Just do it, Jack.

07:43.980 --> 07:46.199
Remember, Jack, I can hear everything.

07:52.572 --> 07:53.674
I've been trying you for half an hour.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.777
- What is going on?
- My cell phone battery died.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.880
What happened at the hospital?
Did you find Kim?

08:00.380 --> 08:03.383
It turns out everything's fine.
She was just at a party.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.851
That's good.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.637
- Did Teri give you my message?
- No.

08:06.837 --> 08:09.589
We ID'd the corpse you brought in.
His name is Alan York.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.392
What?

08:12.592 --> 08:14.394
He's an accountant from the Valley.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.996
We don't know how he's connected
to any of this...

08:17.196 --> 08:19.599
...but we did have a breakthrough
in the keycard.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.602
Give me one minute.

08:27.407 --> 08:31.662
If Alan York is dead, who is the man
with my wife?

08:31.862 --> 08:34.364
He's not an accountant from
the Valley, that's for sure.

08:34.865 --> 08:38.368
If you hurt my daughter or my wife,
I will kill you, you son of a bitch.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.138
What was that?

08:41.337 --> 08:42.839
What have you done?...
What have you done?

08:45.842 --> 08:48.145
Everything's fine, Jack.

08:48.345 --> 08:51.097
But that will be the last sound
your wife and daughter hear...

08:51.598 --> 08:54.100
...unless you get hold of yourself
and you do as you're told.

08:55.602 --> 08:58.655
- I'll do what you want.
- That's the spirit.

08:58.855 --> 09:03.860
Now the keycard, I want you to replace
it with the one you took from the car.

09:04.861 --> 09:06.163
That won't be easy.

09:06.363 --> 09:08.448
Well, I'm sure you'll find a way.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.734
Not without attracting attention.

09:11.234 --> 09:14.037
That would be unacceptable.
You implicate yourself...

09:14.237 --> 09:17.040
...you cease to be useful,
and so does your family.

09:17.240 --> 09:20.544
As I said, Jack, find a way.

09:26.216 --> 09:27.501
Fine.

09:37.060 --> 09:41.565
The cellular customer you are trying
to reach is currently out of range.

09:41.765 --> 09:43.900
Please leave a message at the tone.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.604
Kevin, Bauer's wife knows you're
not Alan York. Be careful.

09:54.661 --> 09:57.714
- You okay?
- I feel a little woozy.

09:57.914 --> 10:00.500
We're almost there. Janet said the
party was up this hill.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.502
I'm sorry, but I think I'm going to be sick.

10:02.953 --> 10:04.471
Just try to take a couple deep breaths.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.756
No, would you just pull over
and stop the car?

10:32.816 --> 10:34.985
You have one new message.

10:36.987 --> 10:40.490
Kevin, Bauer's wife knows you're
not Alan York. Be careful.

11:01.144 --> 11:02.145
Teri?

11:06.650 --> 11:07.767
Teri.

11:15.825 --> 11:16.826
Damn it.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.060
Oh, come on.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.280
Damn it!

13:15.211 --> 13:16.212
Dan's buried.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.215
Oh, that's good.

13:25.055 --> 13:28.391
You said you'd pay me when we got back here.

13:28.591 --> 13:29.893
Yeah, I know what I said.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.013
Well, if it's a problem, pay me whenever.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.700
Well, that's very kind of you, Rick.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.486
But I should probably go, get out
of everyone's way.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.989
I didn't realize you were in anyone's way.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.442
Well, I'm not. It's just...

13:45.942 --> 13:49.946
I did everything you wanted me to do,
so there's no reason for me to be here.

13:51.948 --> 13:53.950
I tell you what.

13:54.451 --> 13:56.669
I got a couple more things for you to do.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.671
Then we talk about when you can go.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.166
This is taking too long, Jack.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.868
I can't switch out the cards.
It'll attract attention.

14:29.068 --> 14:30.453
It will be bad for both of us.

14:30.653 --> 14:33.540
You've got three minutes
to make this happen.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.248
Fine, I'll do it.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.752
I just need to make it look natural when
I go to the workstation.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.260
Drop the pen, and shred the paper.

15:00.183 --> 15:03.603
That's right, Jack. I'm watching you.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.241
Shred the note now, or your daughter dies!

15:16.082 --> 15:17.384
What happened down there?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.587
I was telling you something important
and you just walk away.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.589
I'm sorry. What did you want to tell me?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.841
I think Milo's about to
identify the shooter.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.209
That's great.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.762
We just need a few
more minutes with the card.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.765
Switch it, Jack. No more excuses.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.302
Um, look, that's terrific... uh...

15:36.803 --> 15:38.955
...tell Milo to wait until I get down there.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.307
You want him to stop working on the card?

15:41.507 --> 15:42.108
Just until I get there.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.644
- Why?
- Because I asked you to!

15:46.980 --> 15:48.781
Look, I'm only gonna be a minute.

15:49.649 --> 15:53.152
All right, but hurry. He's in Section Seven.

15:56.322 --> 15:57.574
I'll be right down.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.140
Palmer was absent from the rally.
He was represented by his children...

16:14.641 --> 16:17.001
...Nicole and Keith, who've
been instrumental...

16:17.201 --> 16:19.533
...in bringing the younger
voter into this election.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.865
In other news, Governor Hodges
spent the morning...

16:22.065 --> 16:25.068
...with heads of California's
labor unions discussing...

16:25.268 --> 16:27.403
...the importance of his new
health care proposal.

16:27.904 --> 16:31.407
The proposal would ensure new
comprehensive coverage for millions...

16:31.607 --> 16:33.192
...of active union members.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.951
Mom told you what's been going on?

16:43.453 --> 16:44.454
Yeah.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.012
Is Keith going to jail?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.472
Not if it happened the way he says it did.

17:02.672 --> 17:03.440
It did.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.141
Then he'll be fine.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.063
Is he coming to the breakfast?

17:12.565 --> 17:13.066
I hope so.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.291
Listen, I know it's a lot to ask.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.297
Don't worry, Dad.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.300
I'll be there.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.809
You're gonna get a lot of hard
questions thrown at you...

17:40.810 --> 17:42.612
...not just about Keith.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.814
They're gonna bring up the rape.

17:45.815 --> 17:46.816
I know.

17:50.353 --> 17:51.354
You gonna be okay?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.275
I was hoping it was over.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.082
Not talking about it all these years...

18:05.084 --> 18:08.087
...I started to let myself believe
it never happened.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.378
You don't have to answer
anything you don't want to.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.767
Just say, "No comment," or
refer them to me.

19:08.264 --> 19:10.767
Hey, Nina says you were close
to finding the shooter.

19:10.967 --> 19:12.068
- Yeah.
- How much longer?

19:12.268 --> 19:13.903
Not long. I was waiting for you.

19:14.103 --> 19:16.439
Waiting for me? What do you mean?
Why would you be waiting for me?

19:18.357 --> 19:20.743
- Sorry.
- It's fine, I got it.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.833
It would have been done, but Nina
told me to hold off until you got here.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.452
I don't know why said that.
She must have misunderstood me.

19:29.652 --> 19:30.453
Smart boy.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.574
Great, I just wasted ten minutes.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.426
You guys get your signals straight.

19:36.626 --> 19:38.428
Milo, just get me the name.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.499
Why are you doing this?

20:01.501 --> 20:03.503
No, I already gave you that code.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.439
What's wrong?

20:06.639 --> 20:10.676
I already computed this inverse,
and now it's not working!

20:10.876 --> 20:13.179
It might be the sectors aren't linked.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.680
Oh, you think so, huh?

20:26.993 --> 20:27.994
You're right.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.499
Nice one.

20:33.699 --> 20:34.867
Cool.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.343
- Hey!
- Bad idea.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.345
You flag down that car, you bury
your daughter.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.347
I'm your only hope of getting her back.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.350
If I don't deliver you in half an hour,
Kimberly's dead.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.654
Where is she, you son of a bitch?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.857
You gonna knock me out again?
Because I can't talk if I'm unconscious.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.108
Where's Kimberly?

20:59.308 --> 21:01.310
Just let me go and I'll take you to her.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.812
You're not going anywhere.

21:04.864 --> 21:08.868
Calling the cops would be just
as bad. Or are you calling Jack?

21:09.819 --> 21:11.153
I don't think that's gonna help, either.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.154
Shut up.

21:12.955 --> 21:13.873
Shut up!

21:18.794 --> 21:20.096
Operations.

21:20.296 --> 21:23.216
Jack Bauer. Clearance number Q22, Q17.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.469
Patch me through to Senator Palmer's
Secret Service liaison.

21:26.669 --> 21:27.803
Hold, please.

21:29.639 --> 21:30.940
What do you want me to tell them?

21:31.140 --> 21:33.676
That you need priority clearance
at the breakfast.

21:33.876 --> 21:34.277
Frank Miller.

21:34.477 --> 21:36.696
Hey, Frank, it's Jack Bauer over at CTU.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.848
I need priority clearance
for Palmer's breakfast.

21:39.348 --> 21:41.500
- Sorry. We locked the list.
- Open it up.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.653
I can't do that without
approval from Command.

21:43.853 --> 21:47.189
Then call Command. My clearance
number is Q22, Q17.

21:49.692 --> 21:53.412
All right. You'll be checking in
with Agent Pierce when you arrive.

21:53.612 --> 21:54.413
Thanks.

21:56.916 --> 22:01.370
Okay, now call Division. Post yourself
out for the next hour.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.172
Tell them you're going to the breakfast...

22:03.372 --> 22:06.208
...and that the investigation
is making good progress.

22:20.556 --> 22:21.057
Rick.

22:23.526 --> 22:27.396
Well, you were right. Gaines isn't
letting me go yet.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.535
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

22:34.370 --> 22:35.871
Let's get out of here, Rick.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.300
Okay, we're here.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.502
There's a fence here,
which is over that way.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.020
They've got people everywhere...

22:51.220 --> 22:54.640
...but I noticed they're a little
thin right around this area.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.142
Yo, Rick.

23:03.599 --> 23:04.483
Get off of me!

23:04.934 --> 23:06.686
What the hell are you doing?

23:08.654 --> 23:12.241
Give me five minutes, dude.
No one has to know.

23:15.911 --> 23:17.196
I'll give you four.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.497
No, don't.

23:20.249 --> 23:21.250
I'll be outside.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.611
When I go back out, I'll leave
the door unlocked.

23:32.811 --> 23:35.014
I'll make sure his back is turned so
you can get out.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.217
Go across the path behind the shed,
and wait for me there.

23:38.718 --> 23:39.719
Be careful.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.723
Sorry I hit you.

23:49.311 --> 23:51.313
No, not true.

23:52.314 --> 23:53.649
Also not true.

24:00.289 --> 24:02.792
This isn't the same keycard I was
working from before.

24:03.292 --> 24:04.177
What makes you say that?

24:04.377 --> 24:06.128
Because it's giving me different data.

24:06.328 --> 24:07.129
What?

24:08.631 --> 24:10.633
I was 20 percent through this
just a few minutes ago.

24:10.833 --> 24:12.835
Now it's saying it's 99 percent complete.

24:13.836 --> 24:14.770
Well, isn't that good?

24:14.970 --> 24:16.972
Yeah, if it were true.
But I don't believe it.

24:17.473 --> 24:19.225
This is a different key card.

24:19.425 --> 24:22.928
You've been sitting here the entire time.
Who could have switched it?

24:38.277 --> 24:40.580
I need to post out until 8:00.

24:40.780 --> 24:44.116
No, that won't be necessary.
Yes, I'm reachable.

24:44.867 --> 24:46.002
Thank you, bye.

24:46.202 --> 24:49.338
Nina, I can't talk right now. There's
an emergency down at Division.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.174
Where's the keycard?

24:52.374 --> 24:53.309
What?

24:53.509 --> 24:54.844
Careful, Jack.

24:56.345 --> 24:59.799
Somebody replaced the keycard
Walsh gave you with this one.

25:00.883 --> 25:02.318
Who?

25:02.518 --> 25:03.803
Milo thinks it was you.

25:08.641 --> 25:09.442
Jack?

25:11.310 --> 25:12.812
What are you talking about?

25:13.312 --> 25:16.699
The only time Milo took his eyes off the
system was when you distracted him.

25:23.205 --> 25:25.041
Okay, you're right.

25:25.241 --> 25:26.759
I just didn't want to alarm anyone.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.795
Division got some information.
They didn't trust Milo with it.

25:31.247 --> 25:32.581
Where's the keycard, Jack?

25:38.003 --> 25:39.505
Take care of this, Jack.

25:41.724 --> 25:44.593
Give it to me, Jack, or I'll call
Division myself.

25:45.594 --> 25:46.595
Fine.

25:47.096 --> 25:48.097
Here's the keycard.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.735
What are you doing?

25:55.154 --> 25:58.157
I'm sorry, Nina. I'm sorry.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.660
But believe me,
I will kill you if I have to.

26:03.112 --> 26:04.613
Now, no screaming.

26:07.449 --> 26:09.535
Get her out of there now!

26:12.121 --> 26:13.306
Put this on.

26:13.506 --> 26:15.508
I don't understand.
What are you doing?

26:15.708 --> 26:16.809
Nina, don't talk.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.513
I'll explain everything as soon
as we get out of here.

26:22.131 --> 26:23.132
Nice and quiet.

26:28.270 --> 26:29.271
Open the door.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.187
Where you guys going?

27:01.387 --> 27:04.557
Division set up a meeting between
agencies before Palmer's day starts.

27:04.757 --> 27:07.009
Nina will brief you when we she gets back.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.674
What are you doing, Jack?
Where are you taking me?

27:38.874 --> 27:40.175
Just start the car and drive.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.421
- Hello?
- Jack?

28:09.621 --> 28:10.723
Who?

28:10.923 --> 28:12.641
I'm looking for my husband, Jack Bauer.
It's urgent.

28:12.841 --> 28:14.760
This phone was lying on the ground.
He must have dropped it.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.061
Where are you?

28:16.261 --> 28:17.563
St. Mark's Hospital, in the parking lot.

28:17.763 --> 28:19.465
Did you see anyone?
Did anything happen there?

28:19.665 --> 28:20.483
Not that I saw.

28:20.683 --> 28:22.017
If it's a problem, I'll call the cops.

28:22.217 --> 28:23.018
No. No.

28:36.198 --> 28:37.199
Oh, come on.

28:41.403 --> 28:42.204
CTU.

28:42.404 --> 28:44.331
- Who is this?
- It's Jamey. Who's this?

28:44.531 --> 28:46.258
Jamey, this is Teri Bauer. Is Jack there?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.961
- He just left with Nina.
- Well, is he okay?

28:49.461 --> 28:51.747
Because he lost his cell phone.
I think something happened to him.

28:51.947 --> 28:54.566
He seemed fine. Can I help
you with something?

28:54.766 --> 28:57.119
Yeah, I'm in trouble,
and so is my daughter Kim.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.672
Okay, wait. Slow down.
Tell me what's wrong.

29:00.172 --> 29:00.973
Kimberly's been kidnapped.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.009
- My God.
- Someone tried to take me, too.

29:04.209 --> 29:05.511
Did you call the police?

29:06.011 --> 29:08.514
No, Jack says they can't be involved,
otherwide we're risking Kimberly's life.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.600
Tell me where you are so I can send
someone from CTU to pick you up.

29:12.101 --> 29:15.738
I'm on Mulholland about a mile east
of Coldwater.

29:16.238 --> 29:17.072
Jamey, please tell them to hurry!

29:17.489 --> 29:18.490
Okay.

29:23.696 --> 29:25.498
We're coming up on the hour.

29:25.698 --> 29:28.200
About the time the polls are about to open.

29:28.701 --> 29:31.704
Not that far off now. And I want to remind
everybody...

29:31.904 --> 29:33.205
You look handsome.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.674
Presidential.

29:37.176 --> 29:40.179
- Where's Keith?
- He's still in his room.

29:41.797 --> 29:43.298
We don't have much time.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.301
David.

29:49.104 --> 29:51.106
What if Maureen Kingsley
could be persuaded...

29:51.607 --> 29:53.984
...not to come forward with the story?

29:54.184 --> 29:56.562
I already spoke to her. There's no way.

29:57.613 --> 29:59.114
There's always a way.

30:02.618 --> 30:04.236
What are you getting at?

30:04.737 --> 30:09.041
Maureen is just like everybody
else. She's got a past.

30:09.241 --> 30:12.911
What if there was something in her
past that she wanted to keep there?

30:13.912 --> 30:15.831
You mean blackmail.

30:16.331 --> 30:17.633
I don't care what you call it.

30:17.833 --> 30:21.470
I'm just trying to save our son
and your candidacy.

30:23.472 --> 30:24.973
You've been talking to Carl.

30:25.974 --> 30:28.277
You left me no choice.

30:28.477 --> 30:30.479
No one has to know what happened.

30:31.013 --> 30:32.064
I'd know.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.233
We would know.

30:34.433 --> 30:38.237
After everything we've been through tonight,
how can you justify burying the truth?

30:38.687 --> 30:41.457
Because it's been buried, David,
for seven years.

30:41.657 --> 30:45.160
And digging it up again is not gonna
change the fact that it already happened.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.781
You think about it.

31:22.698 --> 31:25.701
Well, can't say this gig
doesn't have its benefits.

31:26.201 --> 31:27.903
Dude, you're lucky.

31:28.403 --> 31:31.073
If Gaines caught you with her..
.. bang! You're dead.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.793
Yeah, well, Gaines didn't catch me, did he?

31:35.294 --> 31:36.545
Come on.

31:39.548 --> 31:41.550
So, how long have you
been working with Gaines?

31:42.050 --> 31:44.553
I don't know, on and off,
a couple of months.

31:44.753 --> 31:46.054
Is he good for his word?

31:46.555 --> 31:47.940
What do you mean?

31:48.140 --> 31:50.475
Is he gonna pay me, let me go,
if I do what he wants?

31:50.675 --> 31:51.777
Sure.

31:51.977 --> 31:55.063
I don't know, I get the feeling he
doesn't like me. Here you go.

31:57.015 --> 31:59.702
Yeah, he gets uptight when he's on a job.

31:59.902 --> 32:02.404
He's really pretty chilly.
You do the job, you'll be okay.

32:02.738 --> 32:03.605
Cool.

32:05.607 --> 32:06.692
So, how was she?

32:07.693 --> 32:08.577
Sweet?

32:08.777 --> 32:10.279
Yeah, she was okay.

32:11.780 --> 32:13.282
She's pretty hot.

32:15.784 --> 32:17.074
I might want to dip in myself.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.840
What about the lecture you just gave me?
Aren't we supposed to be loading the trucks?

32:27.546 --> 32:31.266
All right. Let's go. Gaines really
wants to get this done.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.081
So, what are we loading?

32:46.281 --> 32:48.784
Everything. We're cleaning the place out.

32:49.284 --> 32:51.370
Man, my keys. I'll catch up with you.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.298
- Did anyone see you?
- No, we're cool.

33:03.498 --> 33:06.501
When we get to the fence, you'll see a
cluster of trees.

33:06.701 --> 33:08.253
That's where we want to be.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.005
- You ready?
- Let's go.

33:17.512 --> 33:19.231
- Hi.
- Mrs. Bauer?

33:19.431 --> 33:22.151
Yes. Hi, Teri.
Charles McLemore, CTU.

33:22.351 --> 33:24.436
- You guys got here fast.
- They told us it was urgent.

33:24.937 --> 33:26.288
Someone's got my daughter.

33:26.488 --> 33:29.775
This man knows where she is. Has anyone
been in touch with Jack yet?

33:31.576 --> 33:34.246
Wait, this guy is dangerous.
What are you doing?

33:34.746 --> 33:35.747
No!

33:36.915 --> 33:39.368
Let's hurry this up, boys.
We're way behind.

33:40.369 --> 33:41.870
Put her in the car.

33:51.213 --> 33:52.881
Jamey.

33:56.301 --> 33:57.603
What's up?

33:57.803 --> 34:00.555
You got a confirm on a jurisdiction meeting?

34:00.755 --> 34:02.574
I haven't checked. Why?

34:02.774 --> 34:04.076
Nina was supposed to brief me...

34:04.276 --> 34:06.511
...but she's not back and
she's not on her cell.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.947
Plus, there's nothing on my screen about it.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.703
It's not coming up on mine either,
but that doesn't mean anything.

34:14.902 --> 34:17.205
Since the lockdown,
the system's been glitchy.

34:17.405 --> 34:19.708
That's probably why
the meeting's not posting.

34:19.908 --> 34:21.576
It's strange the way she and Jack left.

34:24.246 --> 34:25.746
Something happened in his office.

34:26.248 --> 34:28.050
What were you doing, spying on them?

34:28.250 --> 34:31.136
Pull the video from Jack's office.
Give me a ten minute loop.

34:31.585 --> 34:33.588
I'm not authorized to do that.

34:33.788 --> 34:34.639
I'm authorizing you.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.976
Jack and Nina aren't here. I got rank.

34:38.176 --> 34:41.146
- Yeah, but..
- Give me ten minutes starting at 6:30.

34:41.346 --> 34:42.514
Send it to my screen.

34:59.748 --> 35:01.249
- Where are we going?
- Turn right.

35:01.750 --> 35:02.250
Turn right.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.052
All night you've been telling me...

35:20.552 --> 35:23.689
...that somebody inside the
Agency wants Palmer dead.

35:23.889 --> 35:28.693
Your daughter's missing, and no one
can be trusted, not even me.

35:29.945 --> 35:32.230
Is it all a lie, Jack, or just some of it?

35:34.483 --> 35:37.903
What was on the keycard that you
didn't want us to find?

35:38.103 --> 35:40.072
Please, Nina, don't
make this harder than it is.

35:44.076 --> 35:47.813
You got a gun on me, Jack.
I don't think it gets much worse.

35:48.013 --> 35:51.750
Stay on Jefferson. In about three miles
you'll see a turn-off.

35:54.753 --> 35:55.754
Keep going straight.

35:59.091 --> 36:03.228
To think that I ever trusted
you, Jack, that I defended you.

36:03.428 --> 36:04.596
Watch out!

36:08.266 --> 36:09.768
Careful, Jack.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.904
I need you alive.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.609
Come on, let's go.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.675
Stop the car.

36:49.875 --> 36:53.178
What is this place, Jack?
What are we doing here?

36:53.378 --> 36:55.847
- Somebody followed us.
- I know.

36:56.047 --> 36:56.848
Who are they?

36:57.098 --> 36:57.933
What do you want me to do here?

36:58.433 --> 36:58.900
What?

36:59.100 --> 37:01.903
- Take her out and shoot her.
- No.

37:02.103 --> 37:05.357
- Who are you talking to, Jack?
- Your choice, Jack. Nina or your daughter.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.860
Jack, I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.395
Get out of the car.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.981
- Get out of the car!
- Jack, what..?

37:24.042 --> 37:26.628
- I'm sorry, Nina.
- What are you gonna do?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.247
You're gonna kill me right here?

37:29.631 --> 37:30.582
I don't have a choice.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.134
They have Kim and Teri.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.636
How do you know they won't kill
them, even if you do this?

37:34.836 --> 37:37.138
- I can't take that chance with my family.
- What about me?

37:38.256 --> 37:39.849
Enough chit-chat, Jack, just do it.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.643
Kimberly's dead if you don't do it!

37:41.843 --> 37:42.644
Please, forgive me, Nina.

37:43.144 --> 37:44.479
You think I'm messing with you, Jack?

37:44.846 --> 37:46.481
Turn around!

37:46.681 --> 37:48.984
Jack, if you're going to do
this, do it to my face!

37:49.184 --> 37:50.652
I won't make this easy...

38:16.761 --> 38:18.763
Get back in the car, Jack

39:14.986 --> 39:16.571
What do we do when we get there?

39:16.771 --> 39:17.572
We have to get to the road.

39:18.073 --> 39:19.574
Highway 14 is about a mile away.

39:19.908 --> 39:21.776
I know how to get there. You ready?

39:22.277 --> 39:23.278
Yeah.

39:30.585 --> 39:31.586
What's the matter?

39:31.786 --> 39:35.256
Oh, my God! Where's my daughter?
Is she here?

39:36.875 --> 39:37.642
That's my mom!

39:37.842 --> 39:39.210
We can't wait. We've got to go.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.897
I can't just leave her there.

39:42.097 --> 39:46.434
Kimberly! Is my daughter here?
What have you done with her?

39:46.634 --> 39:48.637
- We've got to go now!
- I can't.

39:50.689 --> 39:51.990
Get down, Kim.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.359
If we get out, we can help her.
We can call the police.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.577
You go.

39:55.777 --> 39:57.278
Call my dad.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.508
Yeah, right there.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.210
You just blew our only
chance to get out of here.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.212
Let's go. Come on.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.634
Come on.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.483
Kimberly!

40:34.683 --> 40:36.835
The polls are about
to open in California...

40:37.035 --> 40:38.987
...which is a key state for the
Palmer campaign.

40:39.187 --> 40:43.074
Earlier polls show the Senator
leading by a 15 percent margin

40:43.104 --> 40:46.350
Assuming voting follows predictions,
the senator...

40:53.284 --> 40:55.286
Jack, you son of a bitch.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.301
Why did he give her a flak jacket?

41:11.305 --> 41:17.307
