01:16.801 --> 01:18.900
I can't believe
we lost again.

01:19.434 --> 01:21.233
Well, it's not
your fault, honey.

01:21.267 --> 01:22.733
Youplayed great.

01:22.767 --> 01:24.400
You played great, too,
Mom.

01:24.434 --> 01:26.033
And you played
a good game too.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.999
Gee, if we all played
such a good game,

01:28.033 --> 01:30.067
I wonder why we lost.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.201
What are you lookin' at?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.067
Yeah, I know I made
a few errors.

01:42.767 --> 01:46.334
For instance,
one, two and three.

01:49.968 --> 01:52.433
I just have a couple
of nagging injuries, that's all.

01:52.467 --> 01:53.934
I'll be fine
for next week's game.

01:53.968 --> 01:55.468
Trust me.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.400
I'm still in my prime.

01:57.434 --> 01:59.001
Spasm! Help me!

02:01.200 --> 02:03.200
Breathe through
the pain, Daddy.

02:03.234 --> 02:06.066
Breathe through the pain.

02:06.100 --> 02:07.600
Breathe.

02:07.634 --> 02:10.167
Yes.

02:12.868 --> 02:14.733
Aah.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.500
Ah, that's better.

02:16.534 --> 02:17.700
Okay, kids.

02:17.734 --> 02:19.533
Why don't you take
the bats downstairs.

02:19.567 --> 02:21.099
Somewhere out
of Daddy's reach.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.734
You know,
next to success?

02:26.501 --> 02:28.099
Honey, I just asked them
to leave

02:28.133 --> 02:30.033
because you know
I don't like insulting you

02:30.067 --> 02:31.333
in front of the children.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.600
But it was embarrassing,

02:32.634 --> 02:34.567
the way you missed everything
out there today.

02:34.601 --> 02:36.667
It was like you were
in the bathroom.

02:38.467 --> 02:39.433
Peg, I told you.

02:39.467 --> 02:41.200
It's all injury-related.

02:41.234 --> 02:43.600
Believe me, when I heal,
I'll be batting.400 again.

02:43.634 --> 02:46.134
In both cases.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.099
And I'll tell ya
something else.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.567
It wasn't me
who cost us that game.

02:49.601 --> 02:51.934
It was those stupid calls
by that stupid umpire.

02:51.968 --> 02:54.867
I really believe
it was personal, Peg.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.334
You stink.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.600
It was so much fun
calling you out.

03:06.634 --> 03:07.834
I know it was little,

03:07.868 --> 03:11.700
compared to the big out
God called on you...

03:11.734 --> 03:15.600
but still, it was worth
dressing up like a Ninja Turtle.

03:15.634 --> 03:19.633
I'm glad you're happy,
rooster bait.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.667
You're the reason
we lost.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.800
Your bad,
10-minute-long calls.

03:23.834 --> 03:24.934
Hey.

03:24.968 --> 03:28.099
A lot of fans feel
I add color to the game

03:28.133 --> 03:32.134
with my patented
steeeee-rike!

03:32.701 --> 03:34.733
Besides,

03:34.767 --> 03:36.467
it diverts attention
from you,

03:36.501 --> 03:38.166
slinking back to the dugout

03:38.200 --> 03:40.667
after yet another mighty whiff.

03:42.901 --> 03:45.900
Marcie, Al's had
a rough day.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.966
Why don't you just
sit down here,

03:48.000 --> 03:50.533
and we'll talk
about something else.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.500
You really stunk
today, Al.

03:57.534 --> 03:59.099
You know,
Al is so typical

03:59.133 --> 04:00.867
of a man
when he gets his age.

04:00.901 --> 04:03.233
In his head, he thinks
he's still young,

04:03.267 --> 04:04.767
but look at him.

04:04.801 --> 04:07.767
Two hundred pounds
of hairless, mindless,

04:07.801 --> 04:10.800
aging monkey meat.

04:13.267 --> 04:14.700
And you know,
that's just the part

04:14.734 --> 04:16.899
oozing between
the buttons.

04:18.901 --> 04:20.733
Oh, it's too bad
some men

04:20.767 --> 04:22.900
don't know how to give up
their sports gracefully,

04:22.934 --> 04:25.400
instead of lingering on
like big babies.

04:25.434 --> 04:26.533
Yeah, doggone it,

04:26.567 --> 04:28.400
if we could only be
comfortable with our age

04:28.434 --> 04:31.233
like you darn gals.

04:31.267 --> 04:33.533
You know, I mean in the morning
you go in the bathroom--

04:33.567 --> 04:35.200
A little blush,
a little mascara.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.467
-- and voilÃ .

04:36.501 --> 04:40.001
You got an old woman
scared of rain.

04:42.701 --> 04:44.333
Then you try
to clean-and-jerk

04:44.367 --> 04:47.368
your breasts
into a bra, and...

04:47.901 --> 04:49.567
ease some exercise pants

04:49.601 --> 04:52.733
over that front
and back belly,

04:52.767 --> 04:56.001
and go down to the market
and flirt with the bag boy.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.366
I guess what I'm trying
to say is,

04:58.400 --> 04:59.900
it's just pretty pathetic

04:59.934 --> 05:03.300
when we guys try
to cling to our youth.

05:03.334 --> 05:05.166
Well, I'll tell you
something about women

05:05.200 --> 05:06.467
you may not know.

05:06.501 --> 05:08.767
We always get even.

05:08.801 --> 05:11.767
So let's just take a look
at who's umpiring

05:11.801 --> 05:13.967
next week's
championship game.

05:14.467 --> 05:15.600
Well, jeez, Louise.

05:15.634 --> 05:17.800
It's me.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.166
It's a good thing
for you

05:19.200 --> 05:21.368
I'm big enough not
to hold a grudge.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.700
I'm gonna go home
and practice for the game.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.633
You're out!

05:27.667 --> 05:29.633
You'reout!

05:29.667 --> 05:31.266
You, sir, stink,

05:31.300 --> 05:33.400
andyou're out.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.400
Out.

05:34.434 --> 05:35.934
Out.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.800
Out!

05:45.000 --> 05:47.533
Al, when you were talking
about women,

05:47.567 --> 05:50.034
you didn't mean me,
did ya?

05:52.567 --> 05:54.734
I never do.

05:56.133 --> 05:57.400
Thanks, honey.

05:57.434 --> 05:58.667
Well...

05:58.701 --> 06:00.633
Ow!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.200
I'm gonna go on upstairs
now and take a shower.

06:04.234 --> 06:05.200
What?

06:05.234 --> 06:07.633
After only three ballgames?

06:09.400 --> 06:13.001
Can't I take a shower
without there being a reason?

06:14.634 --> 06:15.966
And I don't want
to hear any more

06:16.000 --> 06:17.600
about me losing that game.

06:17.634 --> 06:20.166
People say I'm getting old.
I'm not getting old!

06:20.200 --> 06:22.767
I can still do everything
I always did.

06:22.801 --> 06:26.334
God, how many more steps
are there?

06:28.067 --> 06:30.800
Well, we got the ice pack
on his back,

06:30.834 --> 06:31.966
heat pack
on his neck

06:32.000 --> 06:35.001
and a six-pack
down his throat.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.500
So how is he?

06:36.534 --> 06:39.267
Sweaty, drunk and blue.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.500
Gee, just like the night
we made you.

06:53.634 --> 06:54.867
Mrs. Bundy.

06:54.901 --> 06:56.500
Bundy children.

06:56.534 --> 06:57.667
Is your husband here?

06:57.701 --> 06:58.700
Tsk.

06:58.734 --> 07:01.800
No. I'm cooking feet
for dinner.

07:01.834 --> 07:02.800
Of course he's home.

07:02.834 --> 07:04.233
You want me
to go call him?

07:04.267 --> 07:06.700
No, no. We've got something
we want to talk over with you.

07:06.734 --> 07:09.700
As you know,
we still have high hopes

07:09.734 --> 07:11.800
to win the league
championship next week.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.700
Don't worry, Daddy says
that he'll be ready.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.099
Let's face facts.

07:15.133 --> 07:17.433
Your father stinks.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.600
I say we should dump
the old dog.

07:19.634 --> 07:20.934
Dump him?

07:20.968 --> 07:22.467
You can't.

07:22.501 --> 07:24.733
How 'bout if we just
move him to first base

07:24.767 --> 07:27.067
and not throw to him?

07:30.801 --> 07:34.867
What "The Say Duh Kid"
is trying to say...

07:34.901 --> 07:37.099
is that you can't take
softball away from Daddy.

07:37.133 --> 07:38.667
I mean why don't you
just lock him out

07:38.701 --> 07:40.433
of his own bathroom,
while you're at it?

07:40.467 --> 07:41.667
That's it.

07:41.701 --> 07:43.467
Leave the man with nothing,
why don't you?

07:43.501 --> 07:45.400
Oh, now, now,
easy, dear.

07:45.434 --> 07:47.300
They can't get rid
of your Dad.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.166
The championship game
is next week,

07:49.200 --> 07:51.966
and they cannot play
with one man short.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.467
As luck would have it,

07:53.501 --> 07:55.333
we happened
on a replacement.

07:55.367 --> 07:57.200
We'd like you
to meet Sven.

07:57.234 --> 07:59.734
Oh, Sven!

08:13.167 --> 08:14.700
He bats.380,

08:14.734 --> 08:16.533
he's got a cannon
for an arm,

08:16.567 --> 08:20.266
and he runs like children
from your husband.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.233
Now, all those in favor
of dumping Bundy,

08:23.267 --> 08:24.767
raise your hand.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.200
Oh.

08:32.234 --> 08:33.366
Gee.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.234
How'd that get up there?

08:40.333 --> 08:41.600
Mom.

08:41.634 --> 08:44.401
You're not really gonna
vote Dad out, are you?

08:46.267 --> 08:48.633
Honey, it's
for the championship.

08:48.667 --> 08:52.600
It has nothing to do
with playing with Sven.

08:52.634 --> 08:56.767
His tensed buttocks
in his tight uniform.

08:56.801 --> 09:02.800
The autumn sun glinting on
his glistening, heaving pecs.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.467
Come on, everybody.

09:04.501 --> 09:07.667
Let's welcome Sven
to the team.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.667
Ooh.

09:10.701 --> 09:12.734
Nice game, baby.

09:13.501 --> 09:15.166
What do you say, young Bundys?

09:15.200 --> 09:16.600
We need your votes.

09:16.634 --> 09:20.133
According to team rules,
the vote has to be unanimous.

09:20.167 --> 09:24.167
It can be unanimous or out loud.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.433
I don't care.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.066
You're still
not getting my vote.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.500
It's just like I wrote
in my fourth grade essay:

09:31.534 --> 09:34.967
Daddy good, sleepy now.

09:38.834 --> 09:40.533
Yeah.

09:40.567 --> 09:42.133
We don't care about winning.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.767
Now, that man loves the game,
and we love that man.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.333
Besides, if we voted
against him,

09:46.367 --> 09:49.433
he'd kick the living crap
out of us.

09:49.467 --> 09:51.366
You know, you'll have
to forgive the kids.

09:51.400 --> 09:55.567
They still think of Al
as their father.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.033
Hey, it's the team!

09:58.067 --> 09:59.700
Hey...

10:00.300 --> 10:01.366
Ah, sorry, guys,

10:01.400 --> 10:03.233
about that little slip-up
this afternoon,

10:03.267 --> 10:04.533
but, uh, don't worry
about me.

10:04.567 --> 10:06.834
I'll be there
for you next week.

10:06.868 --> 10:10.067
Who's the guy with the backpack
shaped like my wife?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.200
Your replacement.

10:19.234 --> 10:20.433
Oh, good.

10:20.467 --> 10:23.234
That way, I can concentrate
more on baseball.

10:26.968 --> 10:29.967
Watch that morning kiss, buddy.

10:30.734 --> 10:31.900
No-- No, Al.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.700
We meant your replacement
on the team. Uh--

10:34.734 --> 10:36.166
How can we put
this gently?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.500
Uh--
We think
ya stink.

10:37.534 --> 10:39.067
Yeah.

10:39.901 --> 10:42.333
Oh, stink, do I?

10:42.367 --> 10:45.066
Let me paint
a picture for you.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.633
May 6, 1982.

10:47.667 --> 10:50.633
New Market Mallers,
0 and 10.

10:50.968 --> 10:52.600
But then,

10:52.634 --> 10:56.133
out of the shoe fields
came a fresh-faced kid,

10:56.167 --> 10:59.700
with fire in his eyes
and thunder in his back.

10:59.734 --> 11:01.368
Enter the Bundy era.

11:02.167 --> 11:03.834
Let's remember
some great moments

11:03.868 --> 11:05.266
from the man
whose jockstrap

11:05.300 --> 11:08.468
none of you
are fit to carry.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.600
Or get within
100 yards of.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.266
Remember with me,
if you will,

11:16.300 --> 11:19.200
June 9, 1983.

11:19.234 --> 11:20.999
Game on the line.

11:21.033 --> 11:23.266
The opposing team drills
one in to left field,

11:23.300 --> 11:24.300
where you, Norris,

11:24.334 --> 11:26.099
were standing frozen.

11:26.133 --> 11:28.633
Bundy sprints to the fence
and spears it.

11:28.667 --> 11:32.167
Mallers win.
And Bundy? MVP.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.767
Let us remember now
Bundy on the base paths.

11:35.801 --> 11:37.400
A little dribbler

11:37.434 --> 11:38.400
hit by you, Nessen.

11:38.434 --> 11:39.667
Bundy,

11:39.701 --> 11:41.233
needing to score
to win the game,

11:41.267 --> 11:42.333
lowered his head

11:42.367 --> 11:43.999
intothe toughest catcher
in the game,

11:44.033 --> 11:46.867
and took out
Mrs. Shephouse.

11:50.400 --> 11:54.567
Separating her shoulder
and ending her career.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.066
Mallers win,

11:56.100 --> 12:00.633
and Bundy,
once again, MVP.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.267
You still wanna
bench me?

12:08.234 --> 12:10.700
Yeah. You stink.

12:10.734 --> 12:12.133
Well, you can't.

12:12.167 --> 12:13.966
'Cause I know you need
a unanimous vote

12:14.000 --> 12:15.366
to get me out
of next week's game.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.133
And I happen to know
that my family here

12:17.167 --> 12:19.567
wouldn't do that
to their old man.

12:19.601 --> 12:21.133
Best your vote
could've been was,

12:21.167 --> 12:22.999
uh...

12:23.033 --> 12:24.867
six to three.

12:24.901 --> 12:26.600
Seven to two.

12:26.634 --> 12:29.134
Why, Peg?

12:29.734 --> 12:33.267
Well, it was
for the good of the team.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.700
Al, you gotta
feel this.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.500
I'm gonna call
for one more vote, Bundy.

12:43.534 --> 12:45.467
You can call your son home
from ballet school,

12:45.501 --> 12:47.667
for all I care.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.600
I know I have the votes
of my children.

12:50.634 --> 12:51.966
All right.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.200
I don't want to sway you,
but don't you youngsters

12:56.234 --> 12:58.900
want to win
the first championship

12:58.934 --> 13:01.134
in Mallers' history?

13:01.801 --> 13:03.533
Well, not if it's gonna hurt
my Daddy.

13:03.567 --> 13:07.334
Well, what about free lunches
at my restaurant?

13:07.567 --> 13:10.366
Can we see a menu first?

13:10.400 --> 13:11.999
Wait a minute!

13:12.033 --> 13:14.300
Now, kids, before we vote,

13:14.334 --> 13:16.066
may I share a little rhyme
I learned

13:16.100 --> 13:19.434
when I was both your ages?

13:20.534 --> 13:25.366
* D is for de many pies
I made you *

13:25.400 --> 13:29.900
* A is for the apple
In my eye *

13:31.167 --> 13:36.099
* D is for de dish
You ate the pie in *

13:36.133 --> 13:40.400
* D is for de apple
Of my eye *

13:40.434 --> 13:43.934
Y? Because I love you.

13:46.167 --> 13:47.633
* Put them all together *

13:47.667 --> 13:50.500
* They spell Daddy *

13:52.367 --> 13:53.667
I'm sorry.

13:53.701 --> 13:55.700
Take your vote now.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.700
<i>And starting for Al Bundy,</i>

13:58.734 --> 14:01.234
<i>Sven Hunkstrom.</i>

14:02.701 --> 14:04.333
Oh, come on, honey.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.867
Don't be bitter.

14:05.901 --> 14:08.166
You can still be
of some use to the team.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.900
Why, a few of us
would like ice cream.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.333
Well, excuse me,
Mr. Long-Face.

14:15.367 --> 14:18.500
Oh, don't you know we did this
because we care about you?

14:18.534 --> 14:19.600
Oh, really?

14:19.634 --> 14:21.200
Y- you know
what really hurts, Peg?

14:21.234 --> 14:23.066
It's the fact
that you didn't even bother--

14:23.100 --> 14:25.468
Shh! Sven's up.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.368
Boo.

14:29.667 --> 14:33.233
<i>* Born under a bad sign *</i>

14:33.267 --> 14:37.266
<i>* Been down since
I began to crawl *</i>

14:37.300 --> 14:39.567
<i>* If it wasn't for bad luck *</i>

14:39.601 --> 14:44.101
<i>* I wouldn't have
No luck at all *</i>

14:46.667 --> 14:48.533
<i>* Bad luck and trouble *</i>

14:48.567 --> 14:50.867
<i>* Is my only friend *</i>

14:50.901 --> 14:52.999
<i>* I been on my own *</i>

14:53.033 --> 14:56.066
<i>* Ever since I was 10 *</i>

14:56.100 --> 14:58.834
<i>* Born under a bad sign *</i>

15:00.067 --> 15:04.767
<i>* I been down since
I began to crawl *</i>

15:04.801 --> 15:07.099
<i>* If it wasn't for bad luck *</i>

15:07.133 --> 15:10.934
<i>* I wouldn't have
No luck at all *</i>

15:11.701 --> 15:13.900
<i>* If it wasn't for bad luck *</i>

15:13.934 --> 15:18.468
<i>* I wouldn't have
No luck at all *</i>

15:20.968 --> 15:21.934
Okay.

15:21.968 --> 15:23.200
Bases are loaded,

15:23.234 --> 15:24.667
and we've only got
one out.

15:24.701 --> 15:27.201
Bud, you're up.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.834
Wish me luck, Dad.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.301
That good enough luck
for you?

15:47.834 --> 15:49.633
Going...

15:49.667 --> 15:52.034
It's going...

15:52.501 --> 15:53.900
Caught on
the warning track!

15:53.934 --> 15:54.900
Tough luck.

15:54.934 --> 15:56.834
Way to let
the team down.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.300
Heeee's

15:59.334 --> 16:00.834
out!

16:04.934 --> 16:07.233
What do we do now?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.834
We have to have someone
to bat for him.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.134
We've only one player left.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.467
Excuse me.

16:19.501 --> 16:21.500
Mrs. Bundy?

16:22.667 --> 16:23.633
Oh, yeah.

16:23.667 --> 16:26.700
This'll be real easy.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.201
Al...

16:30.767 --> 16:32.767
Honey.

16:34.434 --> 16:35.900
Hey, would you
go up there and bat?

16:35.934 --> 16:37.700
The guys would
really like it a lot.

16:37.734 --> 16:39.734
Really?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.900
Gee, does everyone
want me?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.667
I mean, even my family?

16:43.701 --> 16:45.934
I mean, I'm--
I'm old, and I stink.

16:46.868 --> 16:49.967
What's it gonna take
to get you to go hit?

17:02.534 --> 17:06.366
* D is for de many pies
You made us *

17:06.400 --> 17:09.266
* A is for the apple
In his eye *

17:09.300 --> 17:12.666
* D is for the dish
You made the pie in *

17:12.701 --> 17:15.633
* D is for de apple
In his eye *

17:15.666 --> 17:18.467
* Y? Because we love you *

17:18.501 --> 17:20.266
* Put them all together *

17:20.300 --> 17:21.567
* They spell... *

17:21.601 --> 17:24.101
Make me feel it.

17:25.099 --> 17:28.101
* Daddy *

17:36.934 --> 17:38.434
Hat.

17:41.801 --> 17:43.301
Thunder rod.

17:46.734 --> 17:48.966
<i>Batting for Sven Hunkstrom,</i>

17:49.000 --> 17:51.500
<i>Al Bundy.</i>

17:54.968 --> 17:58.633
You know he's gonna
strike out.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.201
Strike!

18:18.734 --> 18:20.233
What's he doing?

18:20.267 --> 18:23.934
Framing his greatest failure.

18:28.334 --> 18:30.334
Strike two!

18:31.167 --> 18:32.133
Come on, kids.

18:32.167 --> 18:33.333
Daddy can get
a ride home

18:33.367 --> 18:35.966
on the shoulders
of the opposing team.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.034
Come on, Bundy!

18:41.934 --> 18:43.934
You can do it!

18:55.000 --> 18:57.067
Come on, Bundy!

19:01.868 --> 19:02.999
It's going...

19:03.033 --> 19:04.834
It's going...

19:07.300 --> 19:08.900
It's gone!

19:13.367 --> 19:15.368
We've done it!

19:17.000 --> 19:18.333
Well,

19:18.367 --> 19:20.533
you know, we're never gonna
hear the end of this one.

19:20.567 --> 19:21.934
Gee, how can you tell?

19:21.968 --> 19:23.800
The way he's making
fire engine noises

19:23.834 --> 19:25.967
as he rounds the bases?

19:26.834 --> 19:28.767
Well, look closely, kids.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.200
Something you may
never see again.

19:31.234 --> 19:32.233
Behold.

19:32.267 --> 19:35.734
A shoe salesman
in triumph.

19:39.601 --> 19:42.101
All right, Dad!

19:44.634 --> 19:46.300
Well, cross the plate, Bundy.

19:46.334 --> 19:47.900
Cross the plate!

19:47.934 --> 19:50.133
In due time.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.101
Microphone, please.

19:59.100 --> 20:02.233
Before I cross home plate

20:02.267 --> 20:06.633
and bring home the first-ever
championship to the Mallers,

20:06.667 --> 20:09.433
I would just like to say that,

20:09.467 --> 20:12.468
today, today, today, today...

20:13.200 --> 20:15.099
I consider you, you, you...

20:15.133 --> 20:17.033
the luckiest team

20:17.067 --> 20:20.101
on the face
of the earth, earth, earth...

20:20.901 --> 20:23.333
And in closing,
I'd like to say,

20:23.367 --> 20:26.233
I hate you all.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.433
I thank no one but myself.

20:29.467 --> 20:33.600
As of today, I, Al Bundy,

20:33.634 --> 20:36.334
am finished with baseball.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.633
M.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.300
V.

20:43.334 --> 20:44.834
P!

21:14.000 --> 21:15.967
Move it!

21:22.000 --> 21:23.166
Hey, kid,
how you doin'?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.166
All right.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.734
All right!

21:27.300 --> 21:29.166
Boy, that center fielder's
gonna get burned

21:29.200 --> 21:31.034
playing that shallow.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.167
Heads up!

21:41.634 --> 21:44.366
Who is that guy?

21:44.400 --> 21:45.800
I think it's him.

21:45.834 --> 21:47.300
Who's him?

21:47.334 --> 21:48.366
Al Bundy.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.366
Did you ever
see him play?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.900
I only heard about him.
Yeah...

21:53.400 --> 21:55.201
I saw him play.

21:57.267 --> 21:59.166
He was the best.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.233
Ran, threw, sold shoes.

22:02.267 --> 22:03.233
Heh.

22:03.267 --> 22:05.767
He was the best.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.434
Is that him?

22:17.868 --> 22:19.500
Nah.

22:19.534 --> 22:21.034
That's not him.

22:21.701 --> 22:24.834
He said he'd had enough
of the game. Heh.
