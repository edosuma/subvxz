WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.336
Previously on Cruel Summer...

00:02.336 --> 00:04.338
You would be okay
if I hooked up with Luke?

00:04.338 --> 00:06.757
Megan:
Yeah, go for it.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.634
Being a computer nerd
has its advantages.

00:08.634 --> 00:09.968
(Jeff laughs)

00:09.968 --> 00:12.221
(clears throat)

00:12.221 --> 00:15.432
In boarding school, your friends
become like your family.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.808
At least Lisa did.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.727
Cuba Libre, please?

00:18.727 --> 00:20.646
It was the first drink
I had with Lisa,

00:20.646 --> 00:22.189
and she's my best friend.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.024
-What happened?
-Old pipes.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.442
Guess they just gave out.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.236
-It's $5,000.
-But we can't take it.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.363
You should have taken my money.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.323
Megan: She just whipped it out
like it was no big deal,

00:31.323 --> 00:32.532
like it was nothing to her.

00:32.532 --> 00:34.660
Yeah, I get it.

00:34.660 --> 00:38.372
How? A window gets smashed here
and it's fixed overnight,
like nothing happened.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.957
I mean, it's the same
for Isabella,

00:39.957 --> 00:43.168
if something goes wrong, then
somebody just writes a check.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.711
Debbie:
Anything good?

00:44.711 --> 00:48.382
Megan:
Uh, no, no, just junk mail.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.134
Why don't we just claim
diplomatic immunity
and get on a plane?

00:51.134 --> 00:54.096
I'm afraid
that would look very bad.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.764
Especially after what happened

00:55.764 --> 00:57.182
in St. Barts last winter.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.938
Luke was the love of your life,

01:02.938 --> 01:05.148
but your relationship
was never the same

01:05.148 --> 01:07.150
when you found out
you were pregnant.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.862
He rejected the idea
of a baby with you.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.989
So you killed him.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.164
(keyboard rattles)

01:36.847 --> 01:38.640
(Goo Goo Dolls playing "Slide")

01:43.395 --> 01:47.399
Isabella:
"Hey, Lisa. I'm having
the most epic summer."

01:47.399 --> 01:49.735
"The Landrys are incredible,

01:49.735 --> 01:52.446
all I could ever want
in a family."

01:52.446 --> 01:55.115
"Megan and I
are getting so close."

01:55.115 --> 01:56.825
"If the three of us
were together,

01:56.825 --> 02:00.120
it'd be out of control."

02:00.120 --> 02:05.167
"Luke's sweet--
a real American boy."

02:05.167 --> 02:08.628
"Today we're all going
to 'Christmas in July.'"

02:08.628 --> 02:12.924
"You'd make fun of it with me
if you were here."

02:12.924 --> 02:14.217
"I wish you were."

02:18.430 --> 02:20.098
(computer chirps)

02:20.098 --> 02:23.894
♪ Yeah,
we're gonna let it slide ♪

02:28.398 --> 02:31.735
woman: ♪ Christmas time
is here... ♪

02:33.028 --> 02:35.322
This is amazing.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.032
I remember that one.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.327
Thanks so much.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.245
It's not fancy
or anything, but--

02:42.245 --> 02:44.247
No, it's... it's perfect.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.170
(sighs) Santa left yours
behind the chair.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.355
Whoa.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.608
They said that it was the latest
hi-res LCD screen or something.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.235
It looks so professional.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.032
Wait, um... is it...
is it the wrong kind?

03:19.032 --> 03:21.660
The geeks at Circuit City,
like, promised that this was--

03:21.660 --> 03:24.162
No, no, it's great.
Really.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.039
It's...

03:26.039 --> 03:27.249
It's just so expensive.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.918
Well, yeah, I...

03:29.918 --> 03:31.837
I wanted to get you
something amazing.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.422
It is. Thank you.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.760
Uh... I'm gonna go set it up.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.237
You said you'd talk to me
before you told anyone!

03:57.237 --> 04:00.574
I had to strike back after they
found your money in the cabin.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.242
That was a huge blow.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.619
I told you,
someone planted it there.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.746
Isabella...

04:06.746 --> 04:09.583
It's the truth.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.919
The money and the bag were
both still in the Airstream

04:12.919 --> 04:14.421
before they found Luke's body.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.423
Then they just...

04:16.423 --> 04:18.008
disappeared.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.262
Someone's trying to frame me,

04:22.262 --> 04:24.306
to make me look guilty.

04:24.306 --> 04:28.143
All the more reason for me
to stay one step ahead of them.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.479
We both know you have
a lot to hide.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.397
(intense music playing)

04:34.858 --> 04:36.610
(electronic warbling,
squelching)

04:41.615 --> 04:43.408
(upbeat music playing)

04:46.411 --> 04:48.538
Okay, Ned,
three fish sandwiches to go

04:48.538 --> 04:51.625
and four extra containers
of mustard.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.668
You asked for two but you always
end up wanting more.

04:53.668 --> 04:54.878
(scoffs)

04:56.671 --> 04:58.215
You know me too well.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.846
Don't know what I'd do
without you.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.817
Did Captain Cray Cray
just hit on you?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.485
No. God, no.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.112
He's just lonely.
Needs someone to talk to.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.573
Hmm. Maybe you're
his special someone.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.992
More like I'm the only one
with the patience
to deal with him.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.994
And now he won't
let anyone else serve him.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.832
First Jeff, now him--
you are on fire, girl.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.417
You're such a dork. (laughs)

05:34.417 --> 05:35.627
(computer beeps)

05:52.811 --> 05:53.770
Hey.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.651
The monitor's amazing.
It's so clear.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.488
It's too much.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.948
I get it.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.659
But, like, you deserve it.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.287
I... I can't compete with that.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.998
We just have
very different budgets.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.333
I know, but...

06:15.333 --> 06:16.626
you don't have to.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.050
Oh, is, uh...
is Luke coming over?

06:24.050 --> 06:26.595
Uh, we never really made a plan.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.972
Hmm.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.349
Things are good between
the two of you, though, right?

06:31.349 --> 06:34.144
I mean, they've been better.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.730
Wanna check out the
Christmas lights in the town?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.815
Uh, actually I have to work.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.735
But it's... it's Christmas.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.154
I-I thought we were gonna
spend the day together.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.740
I know, I told Jerry
I'd pick up a shift.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.991
I need the money.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.701
Cool. Raincheck then.

06:49.701 --> 06:50.785
Count on it.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.973
Isabella:
I'm sorry.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.727
How'd you find out?

07:15.727 --> 07:19.105
I saw the test
in your bathroom...

07:19.105 --> 07:20.940
on New Year's.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.192
Wow.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.610
Didn't know "ride or die"

07:23.610 --> 07:27.155
included
digging through my trash.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.990
We were in a bad place,

07:28.990 --> 07:31.159
I wanted to know why.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.203
To understand.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.954
Pretty convenient that the news

07:34.954 --> 07:37.624
took the heat off of your money
being found at the cabin.

07:37.624 --> 07:41.503
That was
my lawyer's move, not mine.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.630
You really expect me
to believe that?

07:43.630 --> 07:46.466
It's the truth.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.885
That's a line
that I wouldn't have crossed.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.554
Because of what, girl code?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.890
"Ride or die"
still means something to me.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.350
Bullshit.

07:55.350 --> 08:01.439
You can blame me
or hate me all you want...

08:01.439 --> 08:03.525
but we're tied in this together.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.446
The more that
they find out about you

08:08.446 --> 08:10.907
on the night
that Luke disappeared,

08:10.907 --> 08:12.659
the more that they
find out about me.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.038
I haven't given up
on our friendship.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.582
You're completely delusional.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.795
Our friendship died
a long time ago.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.589
And there's nothing you can do
or say to resuscitate it.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.145
Is Jeff meeting us later?

08:40.145 --> 08:43.022
No, he's spending the day with
his family on Whidbey Island.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.816
Hmm.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.360
You guys have been seeing
each other a lot lately.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.988
Have you made it official?

08:49.988 --> 08:53.366
What, you mean,
like, is he my boyfriend?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.826
Among other things.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.536
(giggles)

08:56.536 --> 08:58.788
Uh... I don't know.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.875
Trouble in paradise?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.126
Not at all, I mean...

09:03.126 --> 09:06.755
he's cute
and nice and smart.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.840
But...

09:08.840 --> 09:10.675
I'm having fun, I just...

09:10.675 --> 09:12.969
I don't think he's
my soulmate or anything.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.638
(sighs) Yeah, Luke
definitely does not like

09:15.638 --> 09:17.223
seeing the two of you together.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.892
What?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.810
It's written all over his face.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.145
I think you're seeing things.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.731
I don't think so.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.067
Are you sure there's
nothing between you two?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.277
Oh, my God, no, no,
for the hundredth time.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.489
It's not like that with us.

09:32.489 --> 09:35.825
Okay. It just feels like there's
more of a vibe between you two

09:35.825 --> 09:38.828
than me and him or you and Jeff.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.210
We're old friends.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.920
That's all.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.297
Seriously, if you're picking up
on anything, it's just history.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.550
Okay.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.262
But you could
tell me if you did...

09:56.262 --> 09:57.722
have feelings.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.016
I know. But I don't.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.852
Okay.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.648
Megan:
Who's that?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.113
Thank you for saying so.
Oh, here they are.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.241
Isabella, honey,
you've got a visitor!

10:16.241 --> 10:17.575
Surprise.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.123
Trevor?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.582
Izz.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.090
I had a layover in Seattle.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.843
I only had your address,
so I couldn't call.

10:34.843 --> 10:35.969
Hmm.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.348
I can't believe you're here.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.934
Trevor was telling me you know
each other from Switzerland?

10:42.934 --> 10:45.854
Yeah. Yeah, he's, uh,
he's Lisa's older brother.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.355
Oh.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.023
Hey, I'm Megan.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.317
Um... Trevor.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.944
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.155
You should stay for lunch.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.615
Yeah. That'd be great.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.659
Oh, I don't want
to bother you, Debbie--

10:59.659 --> 11:01.077
It's no bother!

11:01.077 --> 11:02.912
You guys must have
a lot to catch up on.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.080
And we can all
get to know Trevor.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.750
Yeah.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.505
But, I mean, he also
came all the way here,

11:12.505 --> 11:14.007
he should see Chatham, right?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.050
Bring him to Christmas in July!

11:16.050 --> 11:19.554
I'm not sure that, like,
cheesy Americana is really
Trevor's thing, though.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.264
Yeah, well, a year ago,

11:21.264 --> 11:22.891
I would've said
the same thing about you.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.895
But, yeah, that'd be great.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.564
You sure you have time
before your flight?

11:29.564 --> 11:33.401
For you?
I've got plenty of time.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.486
(chuckles)

11:35.486 --> 11:37.530
Great.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.907
Let's do it.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.252
You and Megan
going ice skating today?

11:51.252 --> 11:54.255
No, she has work.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.634
Her shifts aren't too long.
You can do something fun later.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.427
I guess. (sighs)

11:59.427 --> 12:01.179
Any word from Steve?

12:01.179 --> 12:05.099
We agreed to take time apart,
so that is what we're doing.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.728
Want to give it a shot?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.146
It's surprisingly therapeutic.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.026
See you later.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.277
Debbie:
Bye.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.407
-You know what?
-(door closes)

12:21.407 --> 12:25.495
Actually, I'm gonna go check out
the Christmas lights today.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.790
Can I borrow your car?

12:28.790 --> 12:30.291
Sure.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.753
Thanks. (sighs)

12:33.753 --> 12:36.756
(upbeat Christmas music playing)

12:42.178 --> 12:44.806
vendor:
Cookies, candy canes!

12:44.806 --> 12:47.558
(giggles) You did not need
to see that much of Chatham.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.772
Izz, remember that nude beach
we went to in Santorini?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.857
You went to a nude beach?!

12:54.857 --> 12:57.568
Yeah. Nude beaches sound great,
but they're filled with people

12:57.568 --> 12:59.320
that you don't want
to see naked, trust me.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.405
-Eww!
-Right?

13:00.405 --> 13:02.198
I didn't even think of that.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.574
So, where do you live now?

13:03.574 --> 13:05.535
Uh, London.
I'm at university there.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.787
Oh, man, you guys are so lucky.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.540
You've been everywhere.
I haven't even left Washington.

13:10.540 --> 13:13.459
You will. Even if I have to
cram you into my suitcase.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.836
(Megan giggles)

13:14.836 --> 13:17.672
Oh, there's Luke! Hey!

13:20.174 --> 13:21.676
What are you doing here?

13:21.676 --> 13:24.387
I've been searching
for you for months.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.180
But clearly I should have
looked in the mall.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.473
What is this, Abercrombie?

13:29.267 --> 13:30.476
Yeah.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.353
It's a long way from Milan.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.025
Were you ever gonna call me?

13:37.025 --> 13:38.401
(Megan laughs)

13:38.401 --> 13:40.862
-Hey, sorry I'm late.
-Hey.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.576
Uh, Izz, are you gonna
introduce us?

13:48.202 --> 13:50.496
Isabella:
Um... Luke,

13:50.496 --> 13:52.123
this is Trevor.

13:52.123 --> 13:54.125
He's an old...

13:54.125 --> 13:55.460
friend.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.628
Cool. Nice to meet you.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.172
-You too.
-Yeah.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.469
Was this a planned visit?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.803
Nope.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.305
Total surprise.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.182
Yeah. Just, uh...

14:09.182 --> 14:10.892
wanted to see my girl.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.146
It's a long way to come.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.898
Yeah, she's worth the trip.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.984
I couldn't agree more.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.364
♪ Dashing through the snow ♪

14:25.364 --> 14:28.242
♪ In a one-horse
open sleigh... ♪

14:28.242 --> 14:30.745
So you and Luke, huh?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.081
He's not your usual type.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.916
Well, maybe I'm trying to grow.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.918
Learn from my mistakes.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.753
Megan:
Hoo, what? That was epic!

14:38.753 --> 14:40.546
I know, it was
like the best day ever.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.507
Totally worth
all the punishment.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.008
-Hi.
-Hey, guys.

14:44.008 --> 14:47.470
Hey! Yeah. Have a Yule Log.
It's a Chatham specialty.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.763
It is, yeah.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.932
Megan once ate
six of these on a dare.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.518
Okay, he ate seven, but then
he barfed so it didn't count.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.811
-I did.
-Try one.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.604
They're fantastic.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.649
What happened
to you being a vegetarian?

14:59.649 --> 15:02.068
You know, not eating
anything with a face?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.820
Changed my mind.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.656
Yeah, I guess, um...
I guess we inspired her.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.449
Isn't that what
traveling's all about,

15:08.449 --> 15:10.701
opening up to new experiences?

15:10.701 --> 15:13.079
Also, I'm not really sure
corn dogs have a face.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.664
(girls giggle)

15:14.664 --> 15:17.083
♪ Deck my balls

15:17.083 --> 15:19.752

15:19.752 --> 15:22.296
Whoa. Who's this bowl of yum?

15:22.296 --> 15:24.674
Hi. I'm Trevor,
Isabella's friend.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.217
Hi.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.470
You know,
why don't you guys join us?

15:29.470 --> 15:31.389
The more the merrier,
right, Izz?

15:33.349 --> 15:34.559
Of course.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.227
(Amy squealing, giggling)

15:36.227 --> 15:38.271
Wait, can I have corn dogs?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.022
(laughter)

15:58.499 --> 16:00.543
What are you doing, Megan?

16:10.720 --> 16:13.097
You need to tell Isabella
to leave.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.976
I can't stand
to be around her anymore.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.311
Where will she go?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.562
Um, anywhere else.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.731
A hotel. A bus station.
I don't care.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.107
Is Isabella the one who...?

16:23.107 --> 16:24.192
Yes.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.693
So it's true.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.404
You were... pregnant?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.867
-I wish you would have told me.
-I didn't need any help.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.037
How did it... resolve?

16:36.037 --> 16:38.039
Just don't. Okay? Not right now.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.124
I'm always here for you, baby.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.792
Are you?

16:41.792 --> 16:44.086
-Of course.
-I don't know,

16:44.086 --> 16:46.839
'cause lately it seems
like you're so worried
about staying neutral

16:46.839 --> 16:49.800
that I think
you forget sometimes
there really are sides

16:49.800 --> 16:51.552
and you have to pick one.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.597
Megan, you know
I'd do anything for you.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.265
If that's true, then pick mine.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.236
Hey, so, uh...
when was the last time
that you guys saw each other?

17:08.236 --> 17:10.071
Uh, five months ago.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.907
Huh. That's not a long time.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.325
Megan:
He's Lisa's brother.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.410
Oh, yeah? How'd you all meet?

17:16.410 --> 17:19.372
Um, I met Lisa at
boarding school in Switzerland.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.458
We ditched together,
like, five minutes later.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.001
Megan:
You're such a badass.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.753
I feel guilty if I skip gym.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.505
Yeah, Izz and Lisa came home

17:27.505 --> 17:30.091
for fall break together
that year.

17:30.091 --> 17:34.178
Anyways, I started planning
Ditch Day for school this year.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.680
Who's coming with me

17:35.680 --> 17:38.516
to see the Backstreet Boys
in Seattle in October?

17:38.516 --> 17:39.809
-Oh, my God.
-Me!

17:39.809 --> 17:41.435
Oh, my God, yes.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.895
-Perfect.
-Yeah, hard pass.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.398
-That music will give me boobs.
-Booyah! Double D's!

17:45.398 --> 17:48.734
You know, I thought that
you were more Moby
than boy bands.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.903
Well, it's a woman's prerogative
to change her mind.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.489
And yours apparently
just changes with the wind now.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.408
Yeah, or maybe
her taste just improved.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.789
Trevor:
Wait...

18:01.789 --> 18:04.375
How long have you
even been here?

18:04.375 --> 18:07.503
I mean, I don't remember
when you left, since...

18:07.503 --> 18:09.463
you didn't even say goodbye.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.302
You know my parents
don't give me a say

18:14.302 --> 18:15.344
when it's time to move.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.908
(birds chirping)

18:42.997 --> 18:45.207
(ominous music playing)

19:17.531 --> 19:18.699
-Hey.
-Hi.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.992
(Megan giggles)

19:19.992 --> 19:22.411
(indistinct chatter)

19:24.664 --> 19:27.124
What the hell.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.127
-Just a little...
-You didn't have to do that.

19:30.127 --> 19:33.547
(indistinct chatter)

19:35.132 --> 19:36.676
Look at that.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.678
(both laughing)

19:38.678 --> 19:40.429
Ned:
That's wonderful.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.765
-Some hot chocolate?
-Okay.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.602
(door closes)

19:51.190 --> 19:53.901
-Hey!
-Ooh, what's that?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.653
Uh, iced hot chocolate.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.697
So, basically,
overpriced chocolate milk.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.615
Got it. Can we spike it?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.659
-Yes.
-Duh.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.953
Wait, you still drink
after last winter?

20:05.871 --> 20:07.790
What happened last winter?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.793
(Christmas pop music
playing in background)

20:10.793 --> 20:12.461
Holy shit.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.130
They have no idea.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.090
Megan:
What's he talking about?

20:16.090 --> 20:18.426
Um...

20:18.426 --> 20:21.011
It's actually
so embarrassing, but...

20:21.011 --> 20:22.680
I...

20:22.680 --> 20:26.350
once got too drunk
at a club in Ibiza

20:26.350 --> 20:29.854
and got arrested
for public intoxication...

20:32.189 --> 20:34.024
and urination.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.568
In a park.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.236
Trevor had to bail me out.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.071
I got kicked out of school,

20:39.071 --> 20:41.866
and that's the real reason
why I had to leave Europe.

20:41.866 --> 20:45.411
-No way! That's hilarious.
-(friends laughing)

20:45.411 --> 20:47.121
Kellie:
I would die.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.622
Megan:
Trevor, is that true?

20:48.622 --> 20:50.624
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.877
I mean, you know Izz.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.088
She's capable
of absolutely anything.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.926
(sighs)

21:00.926 --> 21:03.179
We... we need to talk.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.430
Of course.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.433
(clears throat)

21:07.433 --> 21:10.186
We are gonna go grab sodas.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.154
They have no idea, do they?

21:20.154 --> 21:22.656
It wasn't the right time.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.992
So what was your plan,
to move here

21:24.992 --> 21:27.244
and start a new life
and pretend nothing happened?

21:27.244 --> 21:29.205
Your parents wouldn't even
tell me where you were.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.873
I was starting
to think that, you know,

21:30.873 --> 21:32.374
maybe you were...

21:32.374 --> 21:34.376
maybe you were hiding from me.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.839
Trust me, you're the only person
I wanted to talk to.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.260
I missed you.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.678
Yeah.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.306
So much you replaced me
with that Luke guy.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.350
A guy your best friend's
close with.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.851
Yeah, I've seen
that movie before.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.020
-Trevor...
-You've been here a minute,

21:53.020 --> 21:55.523
and you're acting as if
these are your best friends
in the world.

21:55.523 --> 21:56.565
Megan is.

21:58.526 --> 22:02.071
I know I haven't
known her very long, but...

22:02.071 --> 22:04.156
she means a lot to me.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.033
I can be myself with her.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.953
You and I both know that
that's not really possible.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.496
You're wrong.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.832
I can trust her.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.708
And Luke?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.836
You don't get to tell me
who I can and can't like.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.673
You shouldn't have come.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.009
I'm glad I did.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.347
Helps to see
what really matters to you.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.226
Last winter...

22:34.144 --> 22:36.730
things got out of hand.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.649
We shouldn't
have kept it from Lisa.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.194
I wish we could go back.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.156
I'd give anything
to do it differently.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.741
Me too.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.707
The police had so many
questions about that night.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.418
There've been rumors too.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.044
You don't believe them, do you?

22:59.044 --> 23:01.005
What am I supposed to think?

23:01.005 --> 23:03.716
-You left.
-My parents didn't
give me a choice.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.886
Yeah, but you never even called.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.971
Look, I needed you, Izz.

23:08.971 --> 23:11.515
I'm sorry.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.310
I'm really, really sorry.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.521
I never meant to hurt you.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.232
I love you.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.007
(doorbell rings)

23:47.217 --> 23:49.053
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:54.475 --> 23:55.935
Thanks for coming.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.436
Yeah, of course.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.980
Trust me, I was glad
to get out of the house.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.482
(Isabella chuckles)

24:01.482 --> 24:03.734
Ever since that Northland deal
fell through,

24:03.734 --> 24:05.444
my dad's been at Defcon 2.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.280
Where is everybody?

24:08.280 --> 24:09.615
Um...

24:09.615 --> 24:11.617
Debbie and Lily
went to a cookie exchange.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.119
Megan...

24:15.996 --> 24:17.456
Well, that's why I called you.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.832
What's going on?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.876
Luke, something's wrong.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.462
I mean, she used
to tell me everything,

24:25.714 --> 24:29.551
but lately it's like
she's hiding things from me,

24:29.551 --> 24:31.178
shutting me out.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.015
Things have been
so strained with us

24:35.015 --> 24:36.475
ever since that night
at your house.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.644
Yeah, me too.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.312
There's been, like...

24:40.312 --> 24:41.605
this arctic chill.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.360
Then, earlier, she snuck out.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.987
At first, I thought to see you.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.863
No.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.448
Yeah, I know, I...

24:53.158 --> 24:55.369
She was acting strange,

24:55.369 --> 24:57.204
like she had a secret.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.206
So...

24:59.206 --> 25:01.333
(sighs) ...I followed her.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.588
No.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.760
No, "I love you"
isn't gonna cut it this time.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.930
-Trevor--
-I came here for an answer.

25:14.930 --> 25:18.017
You've already
made up your mind.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.519
So it doesn't matter what I say.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.062
You need to go.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.233
You're unbelievable.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.069
Goodbye.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.832
Debbie:
I'll do those later.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.375
We should chat.

25:46.962 --> 25:49.339
I didn't mean
for the news to get out.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.883
My lawyer went rogue.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.927
It's the talk of the town.

25:56.430 --> 26:01.018
I've told you many times
that this is your home.

26:01.018 --> 26:03.062
I meant it.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.688
And I still do.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.692
But I think it's best
if you stay somewhere else

26:08.692 --> 26:09.818
while this all plays out.

26:13.322 --> 26:14.323
Yeah.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.285
I had the same thought.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.704
I'm already packed, Parker's
on her way to pick me up.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.664
This doesn't
have to be permanent--

26:22.664 --> 26:24.708
Debbie, there's something
under my bed

26:24.708 --> 26:26.168
that Megan wanted to get rid of.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.838
You should ask her why.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.185
(sobbing softly)

26:57.574 --> 26:59.535
Luke:
I can't believe this.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.496
It gets worse.
She went into his house.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.540
Like, willingly?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.458
Mm-hmm.
I wanted to get closer,

27:06.458 --> 27:08.544
but I was just scared
that they would see me.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.587
Holy shit. What do you
think they're doing?

27:10.587 --> 27:14.299
I don't know; ever since
that dinner at your house,

27:14.299 --> 27:15.926
it's like she's jealous.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.761
Of us.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.513
That's crazy.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.764
Isabella:
I know.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.183
I really miss her.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.060
She'll come around,
she always does.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.019
(door opens)

27:28.605 --> 27:30.941
Hey.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.693
Merry Christmas.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.903
-Thanks.
-Of course.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.075
Am I interrupting something?

27:41.618 --> 27:43.245
Luke:
No.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.997
Just waiting for you
to get home.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.331
How was your shift?

27:46.331 --> 27:48.500
Uh, it was pretty good.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.420
People pity-tip on holidays.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.839
I'll trade my self-esteem
for cold, hard cash any day.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.674
Well, I'm just glad you're back.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.342
Um, I'll see you guys later.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.440
Megan:
Hey.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.817
-Megan!
-What was that?

28:16.069 --> 28:17.654
(sighs)

28:17.654 --> 28:22.159
I was trying to say goodbye,
and he just made it more.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.744
Didn't seem like
you were complaining.

28:23.744 --> 28:24.828
Looked like you were into it.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.955
I swear, it was a slip-up.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.958
Are things not over
between you two, is that why
you never told me about him?

28:29.958 --> 28:32.920
No. No, trust me, Trevor
and I are done for good.

28:34.338 --> 28:36.423
Hey.

28:36.423 --> 28:39.593
Where is, uh, Trevor?
Did he leave?

28:39.593 --> 28:40.677
Yeah.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.973
(sighs) That guy's...
intense.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.350
-(laughs)
-Isabella: Yeah.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.726
You okay?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.478
Never better.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.063
Good. Um...

28:51.063 --> 28:52.731
This place is kinda beat.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.066
You wanna get out of here?

28:54.066 --> 28:55.651
Maybe head to the cabin?

28:55.651 --> 28:57.611
Um...

28:57.611 --> 29:00.072
It's cool. You guys go.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.074
I'll get a ride
with Kellie or Amy.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.492
You sure?

29:03.492 --> 29:04.743
-Yeah.
-Okay.

29:07.204 --> 29:11.083
Uh, we're still on
to hang out tonight, right?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.209
Sure.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.669
Okay.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.212
Bye.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.850
(pop ballad
playing in background)

29:31.520 --> 29:34.481
Wait. I'm sorry.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.400
About Trevor.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.110
Don't worry,
there's nothing to worry about.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.989
No, I just...

29:41.989 --> 29:44.574
I want you to know
that he's not gonna be
a part of my life anymore.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.576
Look, I get it.

29:46.576 --> 29:50.122
If I was him,
I wouldn't want to see you
with another guy either, but...

29:50.122 --> 29:51.790
he's not gonna be a problem
for you, is he?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.959
No.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.336
No, I... made my feelings clear.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.381
He won't be back.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.674
Good.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.349
Um...

30:11.476 --> 30:14.396
No pressure, but...

30:14.396 --> 30:16.356
I thought maybe,
if you're ready...

30:16.356 --> 30:17.816
Yeah.

30:25.365 --> 30:26.825
(sighing)

30:50.265 --> 30:51.475
Debbie.

30:51.475 --> 30:52.893
Hi.

30:52.893 --> 30:56.188
Sorry, I was just
putting some laundry away.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.983
Why haven't you sent these?

30:59.983 --> 31:02.235
Lisa's sailing the Caribbean.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.946
I'm sending them in a few weeks
when she docks in St. Barts.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.160
Yeah, it's what we do when
the other one's traveling, so...

31:10.160 --> 31:11.328
Oh.

31:11.328 --> 31:12.913
That's... smart.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.415
Yeah. Yeah, I read them
all at once when I get them.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.958
But Lisa's hella patient,

31:16.958 --> 31:19.127
she doles them out,
like, one day at a time.

31:19.127 --> 31:22.923
(laughs) I'd be the same way.
Make it last.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.717
I haven't seen you
get any letters from her.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.177
Oh, I have.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.262
Yeah, I must've just
beaten you to the mailbox.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.644
(sighs)

31:35.644 --> 31:36.853
You know, I, um...

31:39.231 --> 31:41.733
I never thought that I would
have another friend like Lisa.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.862
Megan's become
practically like a sister.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.909
The past few days, it feels
like something changed, though.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.494
She's pulling away.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.913
Have you talked to her about it?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.706
I tried.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.959
Didn't really get anywhere.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.545
Just let Megan know
that you're there for her.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.421
She'll come around.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.465
She always does.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.639
Hey, sleepy head.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.266
Hey.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.976
Sorry.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.769
I didn't realize
that I fell asleep.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.479
Hmm, you weren't out long.

32:21.648 --> 32:24.317
That was, um...

32:24.317 --> 32:26.236
(laughs) That was incredible.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.073
Was it for you?

32:30.073 --> 32:31.575
Totally.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.538
My first time,
and all I can think about is--

32:36.538 --> 32:39.249
When your next time is gonna be?

32:39.249 --> 32:41.877
Look, this...

32:41.877 --> 32:43.920
this might not be
a huge deal for you.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.715
It's not not a huge deal.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.844
I haven't exactly been
with that many people.

32:55.682 --> 32:58.268
It's like... I don't know,

32:58.268 --> 33:01.021
ever since you got to town,
it's like I've been...

33:01.021 --> 33:03.607
living in the Matrix before.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.859
But now...

33:05.859 --> 33:07.527
it's like I took the red pill.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.529
That's sweet.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.780
I think.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.407
Trust me, it is.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.245
Megan's obsessed
with that movie.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.206
She's watched it
like five times.

33:23.752 --> 33:24.669
All right.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.131
Hey.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.507
Where are you going?

33:29.507 --> 33:31.301
I have to go.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.887
But I, uh, promised Megan
that we'd hang out later.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.476
Raincheck for next time?

33:39.476 --> 33:41.102
You can count on it.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.908
You and your mystery novels...

33:54.908 --> 33:57.118
If I ever need to bury a body,

33:57.118 --> 33:58.536
I'm gonna call you for help.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.832
Just get a shovel and some lye.

34:02.832 --> 34:03.959
What's lye?

34:03.959 --> 34:05.377
It's a chemical.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.170
I think it speeds up
decomposition.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.964
Exactly why I'd call you.

34:10.507 --> 34:15.011
I'm sorry about the monitor.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.597
I get now
how it was way too much.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.140
-It's okay.
-But it's...

34:19.140 --> 34:20.433
it's not, though.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.269
I didn't even think about

34:22.269 --> 34:24.646
how it might make you
feel uncomfortable.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.982
Instead of making it
about you,

34:26.982 --> 34:28.400
the person who
was getting the gift,

34:28.400 --> 34:30.568
I made it all about me.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.363
I know you meant well.

34:33.363 --> 34:34.698
Um...

34:37.158 --> 34:39.244
I will let you
get back to your book.

34:44.124 --> 34:45.417
Good night.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.461
(sighs)

34:55.677 --> 34:57.345
What's wrong?

34:57.345 --> 34:59.472
You have that look on your face.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.182
I hate that look.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.018
That was the Paris office.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.105
The sheriff
has been digging around,

35:07.105 --> 35:09.858
asking a lot of questions
about St. Barts.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.737
You can contain it
though, right?

35:15.155 --> 35:16.239
That's your job.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.076
I'm trying.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.163
And I've succeeded
for the last year.

35:23.163 --> 35:27.334
(sighs) But sooner or later,
someone's going to talk.

35:27.334 --> 35:29.002
It's only a matter of time.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.182
(computer chiming)

35:44.476 --> 35:46.186
(keying)

36:11.169 --> 36:13.505
I figured you'd be
all cocoa'd out.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.925
My kryptonite. Thanks.

36:21.471 --> 36:24.683
So, um, you and Luke
at the cabin.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.309
Did you guys have fun?

36:26.309 --> 36:28.645
Yeah, we did.

36:28.645 --> 36:29.729
Cool.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.526
Um...

36:34.526 --> 36:37.070
when you saw me
with Trevor earlier...

36:37.070 --> 36:38.530
I wasn't cheating on Luke.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.241
I was just trying
to be a good friend to him.

36:41.241 --> 36:42.450
Megan:
I know.

36:42.450 --> 36:43.910
You do?

36:43.910 --> 36:45.912
You're one of the best friends
I've ever had,

36:45.912 --> 36:46.955
so, yeah, I know.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.753
Are you okay?

36:57.132 --> 36:58.717
Um...

37:03.680 --> 37:05.348
Okay, um...

37:05.348 --> 37:08.184
You know earlier,
when you asked me

37:08.184 --> 37:10.270
if I had feelings for Luke?

37:10.270 --> 37:11.438
Yeah.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.273
Well...

37:13.273 --> 37:16.317
when I saw you
and Trevor together,

37:16.317 --> 37:19.654
I thought, um, like,
maybe just for a second,

37:19.654 --> 37:22.073
that things weren't over
between you two.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.867
And...

37:23.867 --> 37:25.702
I was kind of...

37:25.702 --> 37:27.036
happy.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.332
I don't understand...

37:31.332 --> 37:35.670
Because it meant that maybe
you aren't that into Luke.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.547
That would be
a good thing because...?

37:37.547 --> 37:39.883
Because I think I am.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.259
Oh.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.512
Wow.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.139
I'm sorry.

37:46.139 --> 37:48.850
I... I don't even know
why I said that.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.352
-I shouldn't have...
-No. No, no. You had to.

37:51.352 --> 37:52.729
No secrets.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.564
But... it's stupid.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.900
You guys are together,
it's, like, it's going so well.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.651
Why would I...

37:58.651 --> 38:01.988
Oh, can we just
pretend that didn't happen,

38:01.988 --> 38:03.615
just do a brain wipe, please?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.617
-Megan, are you sure?
-Positive.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.868
Yeah.

38:06.868 --> 38:09.120
Chalk it up to too much sugar.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.372
There's a reason Christmas
only comes once a year.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.616
Can't take just one.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.286
Truth.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.375
The monitor is
kind of incredible.

38:56.751 --> 38:57.877
I'm glad.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.339
The photo album's

39:01.339 --> 39:03.091
one of the best gifts
I've ever received.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.510
Seriously.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.888
I don't even know
when you found time to make it.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.349
I have excellent
time management skills.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.809
And I'm pretty sneaky.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.438
(sighs) Well...

39:18.690 --> 39:19.816
good night.

39:21.484 --> 39:23.444
Good night.
Merry Christmas.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.240
You too.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.215
You're up late.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.552
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.596
I kept thinking
about what you said.

39:49.596 --> 39:52.724
Wha... I thought we were
taking the blue pill.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.142
What?

39:54.142 --> 39:56.269
You know, pretending
that never happened.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.646
It's from The Matrix.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.106
Of course it is.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.111
You know, um...

40:05.111 --> 40:07.071
Luke's fun and all, but...

40:07.071 --> 40:09.699
I'm not really interested
in a relationship right now.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.412
Oh. Are... are you sure?

40:14.412 --> 40:16.372
Positive.

40:16.372 --> 40:18.499
Seeing Trevor again
reminded me of that.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.544
But you two?

40:21.544 --> 40:24.589
That's soulmate territory.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.798
Meant to be.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.266
(door clatters shut)

40:36.976 --> 40:38.853
Hmm...

40:38.853 --> 40:40.229
Hmm!

40:40.229 --> 40:41.648
You got a letter.

40:41.648 --> 40:42.649
From London.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.363
It's from Trevor.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.864
Isabella's friend?

40:54.535 --> 40:57.497
"Dear Megan,
when I heard that Luke drowned,

40:57.497 --> 40:59.582
"I knew I had to contact you.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.250
"When I was in Chatham
last summer,

41:01.250 --> 41:03.086
"I realized you didn't know
the full picture.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.922
"I'm sorry I didn't
fill you in sooner.

41:05.922 --> 41:07.382
Trevor."

41:20.144 --> 41:21.562
Oh, my God.

41:30.530 --> 41:33.157
