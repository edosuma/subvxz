WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:07.020
<i>The first fleet of our
space-faring ships is complete.</i>

00:07.600 --> 00:10.830
<i>It is time for Krypton
to take its rightful place</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:12.830
<i>in the universe as conquerors.</i>

00:13.000 --> 00:15.670
I want our son to be an El.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.400
They'll be telling
the story of Jor-El.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.070
<i>Trust us, son,
we--we--we--</i>

00:21.760 --> 00:24.590
<i>The best of Krypton
will be preserved</i>

00:24.760 --> 00:27.190
<i>within the blood of the Els.</i>

00:28.600 --> 00:30.230
No!

00:30.440 --> 00:31.660
<i>No!</i>

00:32.040 --> 00:33.630
<i>The mythical beast
of the Outlands</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:35.670
<i>has been brought to heel.</i>

00:37.160 --> 00:40.630
- To weaponize it, I need--
- Complete control.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.030
<i>We're never going to
find a way to be together.</i>

00:43.200 --> 00:44.520
Especially now.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.590
<i>Lyta's death,
her Reconditioning.</i>

00:49.760 --> 00:51.150
None of that is your fault.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.070
We need to focus on
stopping Dru-Zod.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.750
We cannot let him spread
more misery

00:55.480 --> 00:56.870
and destruction across
the universe.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.190
What about her?

01:07.360 --> 01:09.740
Uh, she is a mother
looking for her son.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.350
He's off somewhere
up to no good.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.390
That's very likely true.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.910
What about them?

01:15.080 --> 01:18.150
Oh, they are lovers, clearly.
Star-crossed.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.070
Very star-crossed
by the looks of things.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.620
Well, she is a Word of Rao,
actually,

01:22.800 --> 01:26.110
tempted away from her pious
devotion to the cloth

01:26.280 --> 01:30.110
by her passionate love for
a scrappy Rankless smuggler.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.790
Scrappy?

01:31.960 --> 01:33.430
I would say he's dashing

01:33.600 --> 01:35.670
and roguishly handsome,
to say the least.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.870
She seems to think so.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.390
She sneaks down here every
chance she can get to see him,

01:43.560 --> 01:46.670
but it can be hard.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.600
- And they make it through though?
- I mean, for now.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.430
But their love is
tragically fated.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.230
They know they'll
never truly be together,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.230
because they live
separate lives.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.870
They could change that,
though, if they wanted to.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.680
So I suppose they could
leave everything behind,

02:08.880 --> 02:10.150
run away to Kryptonopolis,

02:10.320 --> 02:12.510
and squat in
some abandoned hovel?

02:12.680 --> 02:14.670
Sounds all right to me.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.550
- Let's do it.
- Sure.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.710
I'm serious.
Let's do it.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.990
Seg, my mother would hunt us
down and kill us both.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.510
And I would defend you
to my dying breath,

02:24.680 --> 02:27.240
which, against your mother,
would come almost immediately.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.990
But I don't care.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.150
Let's do it, Lyta.
Let's just be together.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.830
Do you think we're doing
the right thing?

02:56.000 --> 02:59.270
I mean, we don't know anything
about Kryptonopolis.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.830
And what are we gonna eat?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.320
Where are we gonna live?

03:05.360 --> 03:07.230
It's all right.
We'll figure it out.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.430
We have the rest of our lives.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.310
Lights.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.470
Oh.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.790
Well, this is nice.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.550
So when do the people
who actually live here

03:32.720 --> 03:34.110
come back
and have us arrested?

03:34.280 --> 03:36.630
- They won't.
- And you know this because...

03:36.800 --> 03:38.310
Because I have this.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.230
That's my mother's.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.960
She--she wore that
on her Binding.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.190
How do you have this?

03:45.760 --> 03:47.310
She gave it to me

03:47.880 --> 03:49.830
when I told her I wanted
to Bind with you.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.550
I don't understand.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.830
I decided to get ahead
of the whole

03:53.040 --> 03:55.420
"being hunted down by the
Primus of the Sagitari" thing.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.670
You spoke to my mother?

03:58.240 --> 03:59.560
It might surprise you
to learn

03:59.720 --> 04:01.950
the great Jayna-Zod
was not immune to my charms.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.070
Well, that does
surprise me immensely.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.080
Well, it's true.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.190
Seg, your Rank.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.870
She helped me get it back.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.420
She even helped me
get this apartment.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.870
We don't have to leave
anything behind anymore.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.070
We can have it all.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.630
Just like you
always wanted, Lyta.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.990
So, Lyta-Zod, will you make me
the happiest man on Krypton

04:39.720 --> 04:40.790
and Bind with me?

04:40.960 --> 04:43.600
Yes.
Yes.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.670
Yes!

04:57.680 --> 05:00.710
Scan space X 2149 for any
signs of Brainiac's Skull Ship.

05:03.120 --> 05:03.990
Seg.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.800
Okay, scan 2683 and 2684.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.150
Okay, we're going
to start again.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.750
- Seg, stop.
- Scan our home sector 2813.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.910
Seg!

05:15.800 --> 05:17.750
We've been at this
for hours.

05:22.840 --> 05:27.030
You've scanned as far as
the deep space sensors can go

05:27.600 --> 05:29.870
and found nothing.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.550
What can I do, Nyssa?
Because I have to do something.

05:33.720 --> 05:35.110
You can face the truth.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.790
Brainiac is gone
and so is our son for now.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.070
But searching the cosmos
sector by sector

05:42.240 --> 05:44.750
will take a thousand cycles
and it will not bring Jor back.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.070
I am so sorry, Nyssa.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.110
I promised that I would
do everything in my power

05:53.280 --> 05:54.470
to keep our son safe.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.390
It wasn't enough.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.870
You know...

06:03.880 --> 06:06.340
the first time I saw
you hold him--

06:07.920 --> 06:09.830
the three of us together...

06:14.480 --> 06:17.350
A part of me felt like
it was too good to be true.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.950
We're not giving up.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.110
Not ever.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.110
Who said anything
about giving up?

06:29.320 --> 06:33.100
I will raze the universe
before giving up on Jor.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.430
Your grandfather--

06:42.360 --> 06:43.470
you said in the Phantom Zone,

06:43.640 --> 06:45.790
he saw Brainiac's
potential futures.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.510
We have to talk to him.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.140
We've tried to contact
Wegthor a dozen times.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.990
They've gone completely dark.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.550
Well, then we have to find
a way to get there.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.150
What's happened here?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.270
Administering hell-blossom.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.510
Subject has returned
to baseline.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.430
Again.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.030
Your lack of progress
is disappointing.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.550
Walk with me.

07:49.280 --> 07:50.990
<i>Something is weighing on
your mind.</i>

07:51.160 --> 07:52.430
What is it?

07:52.640 --> 07:55.550
Sir, I--
it's Brainiac's ship.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.670
Why did it just disappear

07:57.840 --> 07:59.590
and what does it mean
for Kandor?

07:59.760 --> 08:01.670
I don't know.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.670
There is nothing to fear,
Lis-Ser.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.630
If Brainiac ever returns,
we'll be ready

08:05.760 --> 08:07.080
because we will have Doomsday.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.110
That is why we must control
him at any cost.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.430
So why hasn't it been done?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.150
We have successfully accessed
Doomsday's cerebral cortex,

08:16.320 --> 08:18.590
but imprinting your voice so he
will answer to your commands,

08:18.720 --> 08:21.550
those commands will not take
hold unless we can find a way

08:21.720 --> 08:23.950
to keep his mind in
a suggestive state.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.230
A problem you will solve.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.429
Doomsday has grown immune
to every psychoactive drug

08:33.600 --> 08:35.750
known to Krypton.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.950
What about something
not known to Krypton?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.510
A toxin that feeds on

08:43.640 --> 08:45.790
the pleasure centers
of the brain?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.710
- Does such a toxin even exist?
- Would it work?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.350
I'd have to analyze it.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.230
Can you acquire some?

08:59.440 --> 09:00.580
Come with me.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.510
What is that thing?

09:14.680 --> 09:16.070
It's called a Black Mercy.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.740
It's a parasitic plant
from another world.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.430
I discovered it
within Val-El's Fortress.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.620
It creates an entire
alternate reality

09:25.800 --> 09:27.230
in the mind of its host.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.990
And who is its host?

09:29.600 --> 09:30.710
My mother.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.830
No, it can't be.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.830
Lyta-Zod died on Wegthor.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.430
No...

09:42.760 --> 09:44.110
That was her clone.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.030
Oh!

09:57.240 --> 09:58.510
What do you think?

09:58.680 --> 09:59.790
Do I look ready?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.990
You're more than ready, Lyta.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.230
I've never seen you look
more beautiful

10:06.760 --> 10:08.790
or more like yourself.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.990
There's just
one final tradition.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.830
So many traditions.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.830
It's a wonder anyone ever gets
on with a Binding at all.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.110
Traditions remind us
of what's important.

10:20.280 --> 10:25.830
This garment represents the
joining of two lives into one.

10:26.040 --> 10:30.590
For their Houses, for Krypton,
for Rao.

10:31.400 --> 10:35.070
But most importantly,
for themselves

10:35.240 --> 10:36.670
and their love
for one another.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.150
Thank you, Mother.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.990
What for?

10:40.720 --> 10:43.280
I know this isn't the life
you wanted for me,

10:43.440 --> 10:45.670
leaving Kandor
and the Sagitari,

10:46.080 --> 10:47.400
Binding with Seg.

10:48.280 --> 10:53.220
But everything you've done
for him, for us,

10:53.600 --> 10:55.630
and the fact that you're here,

10:55.840 --> 10:58.870
standing by my side
despite it all,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.020
it just means so much.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.870
Seg is a good man.

11:03.040 --> 11:07.270
I see the same strength in him
as I saw in your father.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.630
The same resilience.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.750
And, occasionally,
the same audacity.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.630
You have no idea.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.590
The only life I want for you,

11:17.800 --> 11:19.630
The only one worth
fighting for

11:19.800 --> 11:21.230
is the one that
makes you happy.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.470
I am happy.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.990
No one should have to know
the pain you're feeling.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.430
I'm truly sorry
for both of you.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.910
We tracked your skimmer
from the Outpost.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.830
We came with news from Kandor,
but we understand--

11:37.000 --> 11:37.670
What's happened?

11:39.560 --> 11:40.950
Zod has announced
the first fleet

11:41.160 --> 11:42.870
of his interstellar ships
is complete.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.830
We closely monitored
all Sagitari comm signals

11:46.000 --> 11:48.870
until we got the order
to prepare for launch...

11:49.880 --> 11:50.830
for Wegthor.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.430
Wegthor?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.950
We believe Zod is
planning on launching

11:55.120 --> 11:56.910
a final assault
on the Resistance,

11:57.080 --> 11:58.190
to send them everything
he has

11:58.400 --> 11:59.540
and make sure no one
is left standing.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.430
My grandfather.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.630
Kem, Adam.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.750
None of them know
what's coming.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.390
Do either of you have
a way of contacting them?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.150
The comm system's down.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.070
If we can't warn them
about the launch,

12:15.320 --> 12:16.640
we're going to have to stop it.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.150
The only way to stop Zod's
fleet is by destroying it.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.830
What do you have in mind?

12:26.200 --> 12:29.430
So, breaking into Fort Rozz.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.310
Gotta get easier
with practice, right?

12:32.520 --> 12:34.870
Not on the eve of a launch.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.630
Every Sagitari
will be on duty.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.670
<i>They'll have
new security codes,</i>

12:45.840 --> 12:48.270
<i>new patrol routes
in every sector.</i>

12:48.440 --> 12:50.110
If we want to get inside,

12:50.280 --> 12:52.550
we'll have to think
of a way Zod hasn't.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.200
I know a way.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.390
Back before we were
all friends,

13:00.960 --> 13:02.310
Kem and I used to,
shall we say,

13:02.480 --> 13:04.030
liberate various goods
from the Guilds

13:04.200 --> 13:06.790
and redistribute them
to the Rankless.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.910
We used tunnels that
ran close to Fort Rozz.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.830
- How close?
- Stupidly close.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.710
Hundred feet to the north.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.630
Right beneath the spot where
Zod built his shipyard.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.950
<i>What do we do
once we're inside?</i>

13:32.160 --> 13:35.510
<i>There's an armory that
only the Primus is informed of.</i>

13:35.680 --> 13:37.830
<i>It's heavily protected by
defense protocols,</i>

13:38.040 --> 13:40.390
<i>so it has fewer Sagitari
protecting it.</i>

13:40.560 --> 13:43.430
But I know how to disengage
its security measures.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.390
We just need to get there.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.940
I mean, how hard could it be?

13:53.240 --> 13:54.790
Should've seen this coming.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.310
Don't let them make a sound.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.470
Shots fired down the hall!

14:08.720 --> 14:09.710
At least we don't have
to worry about

14:09.880 --> 14:10.550
being quiet anymore.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.630
Over there!

14:22.000 --> 14:23.320
Behind the wall!

14:24.480 --> 14:25.830
Breached door!

14:32.520 --> 14:33.840
Surrender!

14:34.840 --> 14:35.870
I surrender!

14:42.640 --> 14:43.630
Coming out.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.230
Put your gun on the floor.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.390
What's happening?

15:26.560 --> 15:28.110
The Black Mercy's having
a negative reaction

15:28.320 --> 15:29.640
to the extraction.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.030
How long has Lyta
been its host?

15:32.640 --> 15:33.590
Months.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.270
She'd grown troubled by
the loss of her mother, of Seg.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.230
This brought her peace
in a way I could not.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.910
I did her replacement

15:47.080 --> 15:49.510
from a Somatically
Reconditioned clone.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.030
When I lost her,

15:54.200 --> 15:57.470
it actually still felt like
I lost my mother.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.110
Lyta's Vitals are stable now.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.600
I'm concerned that
the Black Mercy's

16:05.720 --> 16:07.110
negative reaction
to the extraction

16:07.280 --> 16:09.230
could cause Lyta's fantasy
to collapse entirely.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.230
Do we need more toxin?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.230
- Yes.
- Then proceed.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.590
My mother's strength
has been tested before.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.430
So it must be again.

17:06.160 --> 17:08.800
<i>The Oracle foresees
the product of your union.</i>

17:09.000 --> 17:14.020
<i>The child will be male.
His name, Dru-Zod.</i>

17:14.160 --> 17:16.589
<i>Bio-scans designate
he will be best suited</i>

17:16.800 --> 17:18.829
<i>for the Military Guild.</i>

17:19.000 --> 17:20.790
<i>Barring unforeseen accidents,</i>

17:20.920 --> 17:23.950
<i>he will conquer 467 planets</i>

17:24.119 --> 17:28.550
<i>and eradicate 233 billion
alien life forms.</i>

17:35.800 --> 17:38.590
No, that can't be possible.
Do it again, please.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.430
The Oracle has spoken.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.270
Please!
Something's gone wrong.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.030
Lyta, everything all right?

17:58.240 --> 18:00.030
The Word of Rao.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.910
What the Oracle said
about my son...

18:02.080 --> 18:03.830
You're nervous.
I understand.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.790
You're about to Bind to
Seg-El, a former Rankless.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.950
- What?
- Why would you do this, Lyta?

18:09.120 --> 18:10.670
You told me you loved me.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.350
Do you remember?
In your cell?

18:15.400 --> 18:16.790
After you were arrested
on orders

18:16.960 --> 18:18.550
from the Voice of Rao himself.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.470
Why say it if you didn't
mean it?

18:20.640 --> 18:21.630
Dev...

18:22.920 --> 18:24.510
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.670
Fine.
Deny it all you want.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.190
It won't change what you did.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.630
Lyta.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.350
What--what happened
to Dev's arm?

18:42.280 --> 18:44.310
Are you really
asking me this?

18:44.480 --> 18:46.270
You know what you did.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.670
Dev has given everything
to you,

18:48.840 --> 18:50.550
to House Zod,

18:50.720 --> 18:52.630
and it nearly cost him
his life.

18:54.960 --> 18:59.790
All the people you love
have suffered to protect you.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.590
And why?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.790
I should've let my father kill
you when I had the chance.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.590
Are you all right?

19:24.840 --> 19:25.630
Look, if you need to rest,

19:25.800 --> 19:26.910
I'll send everyone home
right now.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.310
No, I'm--I'm fine.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.230
Honestly.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.310
I don't believe you, Lyta.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.550
How could I?

19:39.080 --> 19:40.510
After you betrayed me.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.670
After you betrayed all of us
and chose your son?

19:48.480 --> 19:49.700
Mother, you're bleeding.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.990
That's because
you shot me, Lyta.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.670
This isn't happening.
None of this happened.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.510
I've never seen anything
like this before.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.110
The half-life of this toxin
seems to be limitless.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.150
Hmm.

20:16.360 --> 20:17.950
Once exposed
to the Black Mercy,

20:18.120 --> 20:21.390
a person could remain under
its influence forever.

20:30.560 --> 20:32.630
Amidst my travels
in the future,

20:32.800 --> 20:34.790
I encountered the Black Mercy.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.910
I learned the only way
to break its hold

20:38.240 --> 20:40.830
is to reject
the fantasy it creates.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.990
But there are few with
the awareness

20:43.160 --> 20:45.430
to see beyond the illusion,

20:45.920 --> 20:48.430
and even fewer with
the will to give it up.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.150
What will happen to Lyta?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.550
That is not your concern.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.630
I'd worry more about
what will happen to you

20:58.800 --> 21:01.750
if you fail to deliver me
Doomsday.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.190
I'm confident this dosage
will allow Doomsday

21:07.360 --> 21:09.590
to remain cognizant
yet pliable.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.310
He'll be in
a suggestive state

21:11.480 --> 21:14.590
but won't succumb to the
toxin's psychoactive effects.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.630
Let's hope your confidence
is not misplaced.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.070
Administering
Black Mercy toxin.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.750
Calculate brain activity.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.390
Neural pattern shows signs
of stabilization.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.670
Toxin's working.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.750
But we'll need more.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.220
<i>General, there's been
a breach in Sector four.</i>

22:14.400 --> 22:17.670
<i>Seg-El and Nyssa-Vex were
successfully apprehended.</i>

22:20.400 --> 22:22.550
Seg-El and Nyssa-Vex?

22:24.120 --> 22:26.350
Have them taken to my chambers.

22:26.520 --> 22:28.270
I want to speak with them
immediately.

22:29.960 --> 22:31.910
Do you have everything
you need?

22:32.440 --> 22:33.910
- Yes, I believe so.
- Good.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.310
Let's get to work.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.270
Hello?
Is somebody there?

24:32.280 --> 24:34.070
Oh, please,
let this be real.

24:38.760 --> 24:39.950
Do you know which way
you're going?

24:40.720 --> 24:42.110
Because I don't mean
to be rude,

24:42.280 --> 24:43.750
but it really seems like
we've been walking around

24:43.960 --> 24:45.950
in circles for a while now.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.830
Seg, I think
you've upset him.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.460
Sagitari can be
so sensitive sometimes.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.150
Yeah, that's probably
why they hide behind

24:53.320 --> 24:54.640
those helmets all the time.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.550
Hey, seriously though.
Are you lost?

24:57.760 --> 25:00.220
Would you like me to show you
the way to the detention cells?

25:00.400 --> 25:02.070
Oh, you're not
being detained.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.470
General Zod
has other plans for you.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.670
Just the two of you then.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.310
No.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.470
I don't think so.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.670
But if you've returned
with Jayna and Dev-Em...

25:28.280 --> 25:31.510
who's watching over
young Cor-Vex, I wonder?

25:32.440 --> 25:34.190
You and your men tried
to shoot down

25:34.360 --> 25:35.910
the skimmer he was in.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.950
He barely survived.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.910
So don't pretend that you care.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.220
I assure you,

25:43.840 --> 25:45.790
I never would let anything
happen to my brother.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.550
Really?

25:48.760 --> 25:51.910
Because that's exactly
what you said about Lyta.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.830
And then you let her die.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.630
You think I let her die?

26:02.120 --> 26:05.070
What would you have done,
Father?

26:05.240 --> 26:07.270
Negotiate with a terrorist?

26:08.600 --> 26:10.510
Do you really believe Jax-Ur

26:10.680 --> 26:13.030
would have let the Primus of
the Sagitari walk free

26:13.200 --> 26:14.670
if I'd given into her demands?

26:14.880 --> 26:16.550
At least then my grandfather
could have found--

26:16.760 --> 26:22.110
Val-El still stands with
my mother's executioner.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.590
- You're lying.
- Really?

26:27.880 --> 26:28.710
Why?

26:30.200 --> 26:32.390
Well, has he told
you otherwise?

26:34.000 --> 26:34.910
But that's probably because

26:35.080 --> 26:36.630
communication levels
were severed

26:36.800 --> 26:37.990
when he decided to bomb

26:38.120 --> 26:39.670
the Space Elevator
Base Station,

26:39.800 --> 26:42.110
taking hundreds of lives.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.510
No.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.480
Whatever's happened,
Val is a good man.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.550
We've all done things
in this war we're not proud of.

26:50.720 --> 26:55.470
Yet you choose
to demonize only me.

27:02.200 --> 27:06.350
I know you loved Lyta, Seg.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.590
But so did I.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.110
Dru,

27:20.720 --> 27:22.710
if you truly loved her...

27:25.000 --> 27:26.590
she'd still be here.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.030
I tried to warn you.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.710
Jax-Ur had corrupted
your grandfather.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.910
I granted you both
the opportunity to join with me

27:47.120 --> 27:48.950
and fight for Krypton's future.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.760
Krypton has no future
if you're the one leading it.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.340
What you did to Lyta,
everything that you've done,

27:56.840 --> 27:57.950
is proof of that.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.270
If you are not going
to tell me why you're here,

28:01.440 --> 28:03.110
I have other ways
of finding out.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.950
I think you're forgetting
that Somatic Reconditioning

28:06.160 --> 28:07.270
doesn't work on me.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.390
Yes, perhaps.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.350
But let's see
if it works on Nyssa.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.030
Hmm?

28:15.200 --> 28:16.950
Detain them both for now.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.670
I want to personally oversee
Nyssa's Somatic Reconditioning.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.390
Dru.

28:22.880 --> 28:23.990
Dru.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.310
- Seg.
- Dru!

28:26.720 --> 28:27.940
Dru!

29:00.640 --> 29:01.630
Stop right there!

29:02.440 --> 29:05.230
Drop your weapons
or we will shoot!

29:28.200 --> 29:31.310
Just as we thought.
We know who you are.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.070
And General Zod
does not want you alive.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.310
Mother?

29:49.360 --> 29:50.390
Lyta?

29:54.440 --> 29:56.190
Lyta.

29:59.520 --> 30:00.190
Lyta.

30:01.080 --> 30:03.310
- You're alive.
- Yes.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.470
I'm here, Lyta.

30:07.000 --> 30:07.950
I'm here.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.990
We should be safe here.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.950
As long as my security codes
still work.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.230
Let me help you.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.710
Thank Rao.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.790
Who are you?

30:54.400 --> 30:55.430
Dev.

30:56.560 --> 30:57.990
Lower that weapon.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.030
Not until she explains
how this is possible.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.110
We know Zod reconditioned you.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.030
We both watched you die.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.830
What has he done to you now?

31:10.920 --> 31:14.070
That must've been my clone
you watched die.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.030
I was trapped in a fantasy.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.030
A prisoner of my own mind.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.830
It took everything I had
to get out.

31:24.960 --> 31:27.910
I was living
the most wonderful life.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.910
<i>Seg and I were to be bound.</i>

31:31.280 --> 31:34.950
<i>Everything was perfect
and then something happened.</i>

31:36.880 --> 31:39.030
I'm concerned that the
Black Mercy's negative reaction

31:39.200 --> 31:41.270
to the extraction could cause
Lyta's fantasy to collapse.

31:41.840 --> 31:45.070
<i>My perfect life
started falling apart.</i>

31:46.560 --> 31:49.750
<i>Memories of my real life
were bleeding through.</i>

31:49.920 --> 31:52.300
<i>The things I've done,
the mistakes I've made,</i>

31:52.480 --> 31:54.150
<i>the people I'd hurt.</i>

31:54.320 --> 31:56.350
<i>All these memories
flooding back.</i>

31:56.520 --> 31:58.350
<i>Like how I got here.</i>

31:58.600 --> 31:59.920
Hello, Mother.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.590
You told me you wanted
to save Krypton.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.150
Ensure the survival
of our culture.

32:10.640 --> 32:11.670
Well?

32:12.240 --> 32:13.750
How did you think
it would be done?

32:14.040 --> 32:18.790
The colonization
of alien planets is our future.

32:19.280 --> 32:23.790
And Doomsday is our most
efficient path toward it.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.790
You agreed

32:26.200 --> 32:29.150
to use Doomsday against
Brainiac. This is no different.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.910
It's entirely different.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.990
Brainiac was
an imminent threat.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.870
I have traveled across
centuries of time,

32:36.040 --> 32:37.590
and I can assure you,

32:37.760 --> 32:40.990
the most imminent threat is
the one we do not see coming

32:41.160 --> 32:42.710
until it is too late.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.830
There is no victory
without sacrifice.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.070
You told me that.

32:47.240 --> 32:50.750
There are some sacrifices
that are not ours to make.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.150
I can't let you do this.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.390
Dru, my son,
we can find another way.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.590
That sounds like
my father talking.

32:59.760 --> 33:03.390
And when it comes to survival,
I would not value his advice.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.910
How dare you speak
about Seg like that?

33:06.080 --> 33:07.270
He has made you weak.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.670
No, he has made me
stronger every day.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.470
Even in his absence.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.390
I am your mother.

33:15.480 --> 33:19.360
The version of me
who made you who you are,

33:19.520 --> 33:21.790
she failed you.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.590
I will not.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.710
I had hoped it
wouldn't come to this.

33:30.880 --> 33:32.910
That doesn't mean
I did not prepare.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.830
What are you doing?

33:36.680 --> 33:38.190
Stop.
You don't have to do this.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.070
Zod!

34:20.679 --> 34:21.750
No!

34:25.159 --> 34:28.190
I'm sorry, Mother,
but you left me no choice.

34:28.360 --> 34:31.230
You need more time
and I will give it to you.

34:32.639 --> 34:35.989
One day, you'll realize that
you were wrong to doubt me.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.949
<i>Then the fantasy reset.</i>

34:46.120 --> 34:49.310
<i>But this time, I was left
with all my real memories.</i>

34:49.520 --> 34:52.630
<i>I was back at Kryptonopolis.
My perfect life.</i>

34:52.800 --> 34:56.030
I have never seen you
look so beautiful

34:56.199 --> 34:57.830
or more like yourself.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.590
<i>Except it wasn't.
None of it was real,</i>

35:01.760 --> 35:05.110
<i>no matter how much
I wanted it to be.</i>

35:05.280 --> 35:06.420
Oh!

35:09.240 --> 35:10.230
What's the matter?

35:12.440 --> 35:14.870
This is meant to be
a perfect day.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.390
The rest of your life
is about to begin.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.350
No, it's not.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.110
What's wrong?

35:23.480 --> 35:25.150
Aren't you happy?

35:27.080 --> 35:28.400
I am.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.270
But that's not enough.

35:33.160 --> 35:36.750
There's a whole world outside
this apartment

35:36.880 --> 35:38.630
and it's in danger.

35:38.800 --> 35:41.550
And I can't stay here
and be happy

35:42.080 --> 35:43.350
when I know what's
about to happen.

35:43.520 --> 35:45.950
- Lyta, I don't understand.
- Everything all right?

35:49.560 --> 35:51.830
- Seg, you're early.
- I couldn't stay away.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.710
Lyta, all I want is for us
to be together.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.750
So do I.

36:04.920 --> 36:06.310
I love you, Seg.

36:07.200 --> 36:11.790
And I want to Bind with you
and spend every day with you

36:11.920 --> 36:15.270
until we grow old
and tired of each other.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.470
- But I can't.
- I don't understand.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.350
Why not?

36:24.280 --> 36:26.920
Because Brainiac
took you away.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.270
Mother...

36:34.480 --> 36:35.270
I shot you.

36:35.440 --> 36:38.150
- Lyta, you would never.
- I did.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.470
I made the wrong choice.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.750
I've been trying to run
from it ever since.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.070
But that has to stop now.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.470
Even if it means...

36:54.240 --> 36:56.150
I lose both of you forever.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.790
Lyta, we can talk about this.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.470
No, we can't.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.470
Because you're not real.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.350
None of this is real.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.190
<i>I knew I needed
to make things right</i>

37:10.000 --> 37:12.030
<i>to stop Dru
no matter what it took,</i>

37:12.200 --> 37:16.270
even if it meant I might never
be able to see you again.

37:17.920 --> 37:22.860
I'd never be able to tell you
how sorry I truly am.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.470
All that matters now
is that you're here

37:26.880 --> 37:28.020
with us again.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.230
I'm sorry I doubted you.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.110
After all that's happened, I
didn't want to get my hopes up.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.830
Not until I knew it was true.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.990
It's all right, Dev.
I would've done the same.

37:36.160 --> 37:38.070
I'm just so glad
to see you both again.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.630
Even if Seg's...

37:44.560 --> 37:48.190
Lyta, Seg has returned.
He's here.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.430
- Seg is back?
- He's in danger.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.870
We broke into Fort Rozz

37:52.000 --> 37:53.350
to stop the launch
of Zod's fleet.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.990
Seg and Nyssa were captured.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.480
Don't worry.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.030
We will find a way to help them

37:58.200 --> 37:59.470
once we get you far away
from here.

37:59.640 --> 38:00.510
No.

38:00.760 --> 38:02.910
If Seg's in danger,
I'm not leaving without him.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.190
Lyta, you're still not well.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.070
I made it this far.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.080
Now, if Seg and Nyssa
have been captured,

38:09.240 --> 38:11.670
they're most likely in one
of our detention centers.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.310
I can find out for certain.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.710
There.
That's their cell block.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.630
If Zod realizes
you're missing,

38:20.520 --> 38:21.390
he'll order a lockdown.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.910
Leaving now could be
our only chance.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.350
Dev is right.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.380
I won't lose you again.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.510
And I won't lose Seg.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.310
There's got to be
some way out of here.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.100
I mean, they got us in here,
right?

38:36.280 --> 38:38.550
Yeah, and then they activated
the energy field.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.910
I've never seen
a cell so secure.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.950
That just means
we have Zod scared.

38:43.400 --> 38:47.030
And that tells me,
he believes we can defeat him.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.380
Once we get out of this cell,
of course.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.910
Of course.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.550
Why is it that every time

39:12.720 --> 39:14.950
I try and help someone I love,

39:15.920 --> 39:18.480
I end up putting
someone else in danger?

39:19.800 --> 39:22.360
You didn't put me here, Seg.

39:23.560 --> 39:25.150
I chose to be.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.550
We're going to be all right,
somehow.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.430
'Cause we have to be.

39:35.720 --> 39:41.230
Because our son is still
out there and he needs us.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.230
What you said about seeing me
and Jor together,

39:55.200 --> 39:57.270
and how it felt too good
to be true...

39:58.240 --> 39:59.790
I don't want it to be.

40:07.920 --> 40:11.230
I don't know how we're
gonna find our son.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.190
But I promise you...

40:15.200 --> 40:18.270
I am gonna be with you
every step of the way.

40:23.800 --> 40:25.830
Hey, I said I'd talk.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.350
You set Nyssa free, I'll tell
Zod anything he wants to hear.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.870
- Seg...
- Brainiac's ship taking off?

40:31.040 --> 40:33.230
I'm sure Zod wants
to know about that.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.750
Stand back.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.830
Dev, where's Jayna?
What happened?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.320
Fill you in once
we get out of here.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.670
We still got our work
cut out for us.

41:01.360 --> 41:03.550
Seg-El and Nyssa-Vex
have escaped.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.910
Must I perform
every task myself?

41:06.640 --> 41:09.230
Find them or it'll be you
in that cell.

41:12.040 --> 41:12.750
What?

41:12.960 --> 41:14.470
I'm getting
a report over comm.

41:14.640 --> 41:16.470
Alarms in the shipyard
have been activated.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.990
They must be trying
to sabotage the fleet.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.910
Is it working?

41:20.120 --> 41:23.820
There's a Sagitari squad on
their way to the shipyard now.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.640
Seg and Nyssa,
how much time will they have?

41:26.800 --> 41:29.180
- Enough.
- And us?

41:33.880 --> 41:35.790
Surrender this instant!

41:36.920 --> 41:39.430
It's not them.
They're just engineers.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.830
It's a setup.
This is just a diversion.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.350
Where's Jayna?

41:47.800 --> 41:49.020
Wasn't she supposed
to meet us here?

41:49.560 --> 41:50.550
Yeah.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.430
But before she arrives, Seg,

41:55.800 --> 41:57.120
I need to tell you something.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.550
Lyta.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.030
It'll take a bit of
explaining, but yeah.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.270
The real Lyta.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.910
Is this real?
Are you real?

42:29.320 --> 42:30.430
I hope so.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.310
I thought I'd lost you.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.590
I know.
Me too.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.500
Oh, I'm never letting go
of you again.

42:45.800 --> 42:46.670
Good.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.230
We should go
before Zod finds us.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.510
Yes.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.790
But let's give them this.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.550
Assemble every Sagitari
in Kandor.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.710
We're moving up the launch
and ending this Resistance now.

43:24.720 --> 43:28.270
When this is over, there will
not be a soul left on Wegthor.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.630
I promise you!
