02:24.440 --> 02:25.530
Hike!

02:29.620 --> 02:30.450
Martel!

02:31.490 --> 02:33.450
Martel, you're a wimp!

02:33.790 --> 02:36.880
I can't believe that.
Martel goes for a give-up slide.

02:37.130 --> 02:40.260
-It did look cautious.
-I could have scored on that!

02:40.460 --> 02:42.470
That could be the last play of the season.

02:42.550 --> 02:45.760
In case you haven't heard,
the players' strike became official...

02:45.840 --> 02:47.600
...at 4 p.m. Eastern time.

02:47.810 --> 02:50.730
I'm sad that the players' demands,
which center around...

02:50.980 --> 02:54.810
...a rise in the current salary cap,
have been rejected by the owners.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.730
I have told my union brothers to walk.

02:57.940 --> 03:00.780
Get me Jimmy McGinty!
Have him here tonight.

03:00.990 --> 03:02.030
Yes, sir.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.700
I'm here with Eddie Martel.

03:04.780 --> 03:09.580
A lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.370
Anything you'd like to say?

03:11.460 --> 03:14.540
Dwight, I know $5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money...

03:14.710 --> 03:18.260
...but I have to pay 10 percent to my agent,
5 percent to my lawyer...

03:18.340 --> 03:21.260
Do you know what insurance costs
on a Ferrari, mother...

03:21.510 --> 03:23.600
Pat, back to you.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.520
That was Washington running back
Malcolm Lamont.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.100
It's all about money, folks,
but isn't it always?

03:30.310 --> 03:33.570
Yes. This is Pat Summerall
for John Madden saying...

03:33.780 --> 03:35.990
...so long from Nextel Stadium.

03:36.940 --> 03:40.160
-You look like shit.
-I'm dying, Jimmy.

03:42.660 --> 03:43.790
Come on.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.660
You've been dying for 20 years.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.880
-Give me a cigarette.
-I quit.

03:58.510 --> 04:00.560
Nobody likes a quitter.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.810
-See the game today?
-No.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.310
Why, you liar.

04:07.770 --> 04:10.400
Could you believe that slide by Martel?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.360
What a pussy.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.990
-What's up?
-Take a ride with me.

04:21.290 --> 04:22.660
How's the wife?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.670
She had her lips done.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.000
I never even knew
you could have your lips done.

04:29.090 --> 04:31.840
Looks like a largemouth bass.

04:34.850 --> 04:38.180
I'm too old to screw around.
Let me give it to you straight.

04:38.430 --> 04:39.480
I want you back.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.270
-You already have a coach.
-I'll take care of it.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.530
-Like you took care of me.
-Now, Jimmy...

04:46.690 --> 04:49.190
Your players all flew home
to their castles...

04:49.450 --> 04:50.820
...in their private jets.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.070
We're gonna finish the season anyway.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.540
I'm gonna use replacement players.

04:55.910 --> 04:59.620
-Jeez, what a business.
-We've got four games left.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.080
We win three, we're in the playoffs.

05:02.290 --> 05:05.710
Really? Win three out of four
with replacement players?

05:05.880 --> 05:07.420
That's not too much to ask.

05:08.010 --> 05:10.510
You won for me once, you can do it again.

05:12.350 --> 05:13.760
What's the matter, Jimmy?

05:14.060 --> 05:17.270
Nobody's gonna give you
a better chance than this...

05:17.560 --> 05:19.400
...after that Dallas mess.

05:21.110 --> 05:24.400
-I was right about that.
-It had nothing to do with being right!

05:24.610 --> 05:27.200
You went head-to-head
with an $8 million quarterback.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.910
Who did you think was gonna win?
That's not gonna happen here!

05:31.120 --> 05:35.580
I'm talking about a team
of poor nobodies who play to win...

05:35.790 --> 05:37.830
...not a bunch of bitchy millionaires.

05:39.630 --> 05:40.750
Come on, Jimmy!

05:42.090 --> 05:43.590
I'm thinking.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.430
Hello!

05:51.140 --> 05:51.980
Hello!

06:06.080 --> 06:08.290
I want total control of my team.

06:08.490 --> 06:12.290
I want to be able to recruit anybody
that I want, no interference.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.630
My word is my bond.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.170
I want it in writing.

06:21.890 --> 06:23.300
Okay, Jimmy.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.850
Okay.

06:27.310 --> 06:29.480
We thought we'd skip
special teams for now.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.810
It'll be tough enough
to put together a team in a week.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.610
-We're gonna go a different way.
-A different way?

06:36.070 --> 06:39.070
Here's a list of people
I've been watching over the years.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.320
They've all played football,
not all of them in the pros.

06:42.620 --> 06:45.290
But they all have something
unique to bring to the game.

06:45.370 --> 06:48.420
We'll take them and try
to put together a winning team.

06:48.620 --> 06:51.710
If nothing else,
they should be fun to watch.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.510
Daniel Bateman, SWAT team officer.

06:55.170 --> 06:58.720
Awarded a Purple Heart for losing
a kidney during the Gulf War.

07:03.430 --> 07:06.270
A walk-on at Michigan State
before he gave up football...

07:06.480 --> 07:09.570
...to sneak back into the service
for one more tour of duty.

07:10.110 --> 07:11.230
Clifford Franklin.

07:12.190 --> 07:17.120
Great attitude, great desire, and
the fastest son of a bitch I've ever seen.

07:19.530 --> 07:21.370
Clifford! Twinkie!

07:27.380 --> 07:29.800
What's up, man? Got any Twinkies?

07:30.090 --> 07:31.130
Can he catch?

07:42.310 --> 07:43.600
That's why I have you.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.610
André and Jamal Jackson.

07:46.820 --> 07:50.610
Together, these guys were the best
tandem team of guards in the game.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.950
-You're kidding me!
-André got traded and they fell apart.

07:57.080 --> 08:01.080
He ain't our problem no more.
We gonna play football.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.840
-Football?
-Football.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.090
Nigel Gruff.

08:07.710 --> 08:11.470
Striker out of Cardiff,
now residing in HelI's Kitchen.

08:12.220 --> 08:16.270
He's called "The Leg" because he can kick
a soccer ball the length of the field.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.730
Gentlemen...

08:17.940 --> 08:21.110
...the drinks are on the house!

08:23.190 --> 08:24.360
Bollocks!

08:25.240 --> 08:27.280
Pissing away our money again?

08:27.450 --> 08:30.740
-No, the money's on the way.
-Where? To the OTB?

08:30.950 --> 08:33.620
I got a winning horse!
I swear on my mom's grave!

08:33.830 --> 08:36.789
Your mother's grave?
He's swearing on his mother's grave!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.130
Nigel, listen. I want my money!

08:39.340 --> 08:42.049
-Has he kept in shape?
-By Welsh standards.

08:43.630 --> 08:44.670
Shane Falco.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.850
Shane Falco?
"Footsteps" Falco from Ohio State?

08:50.060 --> 08:51.140
The same.

08:52.680 --> 08:56.060
-He hasn't played in years.
-Should be well rested then.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.650
You look like a swordfish I caught once.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.990
He hit the deck just like that.

09:06.990 --> 09:09.200
-You know who I am?
-Yeah.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.410
You're Jimmy McGinty.

09:11.620 --> 09:14.250
That old coach from the '80s.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.210
We met just before the Sugar Bowl.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.010
I remember.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.640
Hell of a game that Sugar Bowl.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.850
-What'd you lose that by? 40 points?
-That would be 45.

09:29.890 --> 09:33.520
Sometimes a game like that sticks
with you. You never shake it off.

09:33.690 --> 09:37.240
-Got three concussions to prove it.
-That's why girls don't play.

09:39.860 --> 09:41.160
Why are you here, coach?

09:41.280 --> 09:44.030
I'm back with the Sentinels.
I want you to quarterback.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.870
I found the best guards
and a wide receiver...

09:46.950 --> 09:48.580
...even you couldn't overthrow.

09:51.130 --> 09:52.960
-I'm retired.
-Retired?

09:54.210 --> 09:57.220
It looks like things have gone
real well for you since.

09:59.050 --> 10:00.550
I got no complaints.

10:01.220 --> 10:02.640
It's quiet here.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.890
Nobody bothers me.

10:05.310 --> 10:09.060
That's the great thing about plankton,
it pretty much keeps to itself.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.240
You know what separates the winners
from the losers?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.570
The score.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.160
Getting back up
after being kicked in the teeth.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.830
I watched films of your games
since the Sugar Bowl.

10:24.910 --> 10:28.500
You shouldn't have been trying
to carry the whole team that first year.

10:28.710 --> 10:31.050
Your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled.

10:33.510 --> 10:37.640
-Is that how you want to be remembered?
-I don't want to be remembered at all.

10:38.050 --> 10:41.850
You're young. lf you do well,
who knows what'll happen after the strike.

10:41.930 --> 10:45.770
I'm not making you any promises,
but why don't you take a chance?

10:46.320 --> 10:50.070
Rather than scraping crap
off the bottom of somebody else's toys.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.540
Think it over.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.010
You could be part of something.

11:12.970 --> 11:17.600
I'm here to remind fans that what
the owners are doing is unconscionable.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.310
They have blatantly hired scabs...

11:20.980 --> 11:25.240
...which goes against our Constitution,
the Declaration of lndependence...

11:25.440 --> 11:28.950
...and the Emancipation Proclamation.
Here come the scabs now!

11:31.570 --> 11:32.870
That's Eddie Martel!

11:33.080 --> 11:34.290
That's Wilson Carr!

11:35.700 --> 11:36.960
Hey, Wilson!

11:37.120 --> 11:39.630
I love you, man! What's happening?

11:41.460 --> 11:42.500
I love you, man!

11:44.420 --> 11:47.430
I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass,
and in your ass!

11:47.680 --> 11:48.890
Piss off!

11:49.640 --> 11:50.760
Piss off!

12:18.340 --> 12:20.470
Get that bible out of here!

12:24.340 --> 12:25.640
Sorry about this.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.020
Put God in your heart!

12:37.570 --> 12:39.030
I'm very sorry.

12:45.950 --> 12:48.620
Get a job, you wankers!

13:09.060 --> 13:13.070
Looking good out there!
You've got the goods!

13:13.280 --> 13:15.570
Where did you learn to catch like that?

13:33.090 --> 13:37.100
Roberts, make that D-back commit
before you cut, all right?

13:37.760 --> 13:38.890
Jimmy.

13:39.220 --> 13:43.020
-My tight end is deaf.
-Yeah, I know.

13:43.230 --> 13:46.110
Jimmy, how am I gonna coach a deaf man?

13:46.270 --> 13:47.400
You won't need to.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.110
Brian Murphy would've gone
in the first round if he wasn't deaf.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.160
Played college ball
here in D.C. at Gallaudet.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.290
But I've got to be able
to communicate with him and how...

13:57.830 --> 13:59.290
Learn to sign.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.540
Horseshit!

14:00.750 --> 14:04.670
Look at it this way,
he'll never be called offsides on an audible.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.760
-Good to see you.
-You too.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.840
-How are you?
-Good.

14:12.090 --> 14:13.220
This is "The Leg"?

14:15.600 --> 14:17.970
I thought you told me he was solid muscle.

14:18.140 --> 14:19.940
He's much stronger than he looks.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.060
I'm wiry.

14:22.650 --> 14:24.320
Go get some kicks in.

14:31.530 --> 14:32.780
He's "wiry."

14:34.330 --> 14:35.450
"Wiry."

14:49.300 --> 14:51.850
I'm sure you've been briefed
as to your situation.

14:52.010 --> 14:54.600
Coach McGinty wanted you
with us for five weeks...

14:54.810 --> 14:56.480
...and the Governor's complied.

14:56.850 --> 14:57.940
Nice watch.

14:58.150 --> 14:59.110
What?

14:59.310 --> 15:00.400
This?

15:00.770 --> 15:02.280
It's a fake.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.150
Damn thing's always broken.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.570
It's only right twice a day.

15:06.860 --> 15:08.580
Why don't we join the others?

15:08.990 --> 15:11.870
No sense standing here by ourselves...

15:12.080 --> 15:13.910
...out of screaming distance.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.130
-Come on, let's fire out of there!
-Jimmy.

15:17.340 --> 15:20.510
-Falco, when's he coming?
-Relax, he'll be here.

15:20.670 --> 15:21.880
Come on, quick feet!

15:21.970 --> 15:25.720
I am relaxed, but that's not the point.
It's nervous energy.

15:25.890 --> 15:28.430
Case in point:
We don't have a quarterback, do we?

15:28.640 --> 15:31.690
-Fire out of there!
-We don't have a game plan for Sunday.

15:31.890 --> 15:35.860
The only good thing I can say
about our one offensive weapon is...

15:36.070 --> 15:38.480
...it's "wiry." What the shit is that?

15:38.690 --> 15:39.950
No, no, it's "wiry."

15:40.150 --> 15:43.160
-However the hell you say it!
-Say it: "Wiry."

15:47.410 --> 15:48.250
"Wiry."

15:48.450 --> 15:51.330
Holy! Look at this mamma-jamma!

16:04.260 --> 16:05.520
Have you lost weight?

16:06.020 --> 16:07.310
Coach, don't say that.

16:08.020 --> 16:10.610
You look great.
Why don't you work out on SOD?

16:10.810 --> 16:11.940
SOD.

16:13.980 --> 16:16.610
-He's lost weight?
-Sumo wrestler.

16:16.820 --> 16:20.950
Expert at pushing people around.
That's what pass blocking is, remember?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.160
That's right.

16:22.990 --> 16:24.370
Next one, 74. Come on!

16:25.040 --> 16:26.500
Set, hut!

16:27.920 --> 16:29.210
All right! Way to go!

16:30.630 --> 16:34.510
It's all about pushing people around!
Set! Hut!

16:37.470 --> 16:40.680
Come on, Sumo boy.
Let's see what you can do.

16:40.890 --> 16:41.720
Set. Hut!

16:46.770 --> 16:49.650
Yes! Good hit, Sumo boy!
Now get this off of me!

16:49.860 --> 16:51.570
"That'll do, pig, that'll do."

16:51.860 --> 16:55.700
-Screw you, cockroach.
-You'll have to find your dick first.

16:55.990 --> 16:58.030
Get this off of me!

17:15.010 --> 17:16.680
Hey, scab!

17:17.849 --> 17:20.390
-I don't want any trouble.
-You hear that?

17:20.560 --> 17:23.400
He's taking away my job,
but he doesn't want any trouble.

17:23.480 --> 17:27.190
Not only is he taking your job,
he's taking your parking space too.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.530
What's up?

17:29.320 --> 17:31.070
Is that right, Falco?

17:32.070 --> 17:34.370
I didn't know it was yours. I'll move it.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.040
No, let us do that.

17:36.410 --> 17:39.040
Guys, move the new boy's ride for him.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.380
Coming right up, Mr. Falco.

17:46.550 --> 17:47.380
Ready?

17:48.090 --> 17:50.850
One. Two. Three.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.770
Thanks, guys.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.530
Asshole.

18:04.860 --> 18:08.030
Jesus! "Footsteps" Falco.
They must be getting desperate.

18:08.240 --> 18:09.700
Hey, Falco!

18:09.870 --> 18:12.080
You're not even a has-been!

18:12.540 --> 18:14.660
You're a never-was!

18:18.840 --> 18:19.880
Go!

18:24.890 --> 18:26.090
Come on, let's pick it up!

18:32.480 --> 18:35.480
Form a line here! Let's go seven on seven.

18:37.270 --> 18:39.740
Check it out, it's our new quarterback.

18:48.450 --> 18:50.160
We're in business now.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.170
You're late.

18:55.420 --> 18:56.670
Car trouble.

18:57.590 --> 18:59.010
You still got an arm?

19:04.930 --> 19:06.180
Hey, Falco.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.270
Go!

19:28.370 --> 19:29.790
That's gonna leave a mark.

19:31.340 --> 19:34.510
-Leo, Franklin's down again.
-I'm okay.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.220
I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:37.430 --> 19:38.800
Let's play some football!

20:05.830 --> 20:06.840
Danny Bateman.

20:07.170 --> 20:08.710
Shane Falco.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.260
Nice pop, Danny.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.170
Thanks, coach.

20:12.260 --> 20:15.300
In practice, we don't hit the fellows
with the red shirts on.

20:15.430 --> 20:19.600
I know, but I see that red
and I just want to go after it like a bull.

20:21.850 --> 20:22.900
Okay, Danny.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.560
Huddle up!

20:29.360 --> 20:33.120
Get used to setting up on the run.
Move fast, think even faster.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.200
-You'll live longer.
-I'm very interested in that.

20:36.370 --> 20:37.500
Huddle up!

20:46.210 --> 20:48.760
Hey! Shane Falco.

20:49.550 --> 20:52.100
I lost a ton of money
on that Sugar Bowl of yours.

20:52.300 --> 20:54.310
What a bloody shambles that was.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.350
You could smell the stink
all the way back in Wales.

20:59.730 --> 21:01.230
Nice meeting you.

21:42.650 --> 21:43.490
Ready!

21:46.120 --> 21:47.240
Ready!

22:03.140 --> 22:04.180
Hut!

22:12.900 --> 22:17.150
Shit! I forgot about the whole red
shirt thing! This game's confusing.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.570
Remember...

22:22.830 --> 22:25.290
...red means stop.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.370
Like a streetlight, right?

22:27.870 --> 22:30.170
-Yeah.
-Get on up.

22:30.670 --> 22:34.260
Go ahead. I'm gonna lie here
a moment and collect my thoughts.

22:34.590 --> 22:35.970
Work shit out, right?

22:43.020 --> 22:46.100
-You should be glad he's on your side.
-Yeah.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.450
-So you have a cheer or something?
-Are you ready?

22:59.660 --> 23:02.870
"Let's hear it for the quarterback
Hey-hey, ho-ho

23:03.080 --> 23:06.540
"Could anyone play better?
Say-say, no-no

23:06.710 --> 23:09.380
"Tackle, tackle, tackle, tackle
Tack, tack, tack

23:09.550 --> 23:12.260
"Show those others boys what they
lack, lack, lack

23:12.470 --> 23:15.220
"lf I gave you a dollar
You could keep most of the change

23:15.430 --> 23:18.720
"'Cause all I really want is a quarterback! "

23:20.390 --> 23:23.230
"California oranges, Texas cactus

23:23.400 --> 23:26.480
"We think your team needs a little practice

23:26.690 --> 23:29.940
"Sit 'em in a highchair
Feed 'em with a spoon

23:30.150 --> 23:33.070
"Roll 'em up in toilet paper
Kick 'em to the moon! "

23:33.660 --> 23:35.830
-That was great, thank you.
-Thank you.

23:36.030 --> 23:37.200
Can you dance?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.430
Let me have some of that duck.

23:51.340 --> 23:54.100
-What the hell is this?
-Chinese spareribs.

23:54.310 --> 23:57.100
If you don't want it,
get the fuck out of here.

23:57.310 --> 24:00.400
I'm trying to figure out
how the Chinaman over here...

24:00.610 --> 24:03.360
...gets 700 pounds off of eating this shit.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.440
I'm Japanese, not Chinese.

24:05.990 --> 24:07.650
-Same difference.
-What?

24:07.820 --> 24:09.200
It's the same difference!

24:09.280 --> 24:11.160
All that big...

24:15.000 --> 24:16.460
Nigger, please.

24:16.670 --> 24:20.130
You do know Japan and China
are two different countries, right?

24:20.340 --> 24:23.050
-You do know I got an atlas, bitch?
-Really, gangster?

24:23.260 --> 24:24.260
Yeah.

24:29.890 --> 24:33.310
We're on the same team!
We're on the same team! Now chill out!

24:33.810 --> 24:37.150
-The mick's right.
-I'm not a mick! I'm bloody Welsh!

24:38.980 --> 24:39.980
Whatever.

24:40.110 --> 24:42.820
-I'm going to sit with the deaf kid!
-Jesus Christ!

24:43.030 --> 24:46.450
Praise his glory, Nigel!
You praise his glory!

24:48.450 --> 24:50.790
"Slash 'em, slash 'em
Cut 'em down

24:51.160 --> 24:53.540
"Smear their blood all over town

24:53.750 --> 24:56.500
"Punch 'em, hit 'em
Make it last

24:56.750 --> 24:59.630
"Come on, boys, let's kick some ass! "

25:04.390 --> 25:07.890
I played one game in the pros,
I blew out my knee and that was it.

25:08.310 --> 25:09.480
Shit.

25:10.020 --> 25:14.360
All I want to do is score one touchdown
before I hang up my pads. That's it.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.320
You'll get it.

25:29.410 --> 25:30.210
Hey, man.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.590
Wilkinson! Earl Wilkinson!

25:35.340 --> 25:38.010
I knew I recognized you, man! I knew it!

25:38.340 --> 25:40.220
You played for Minnesota, baby!

25:40.430 --> 25:44.140
Oh, shit! Earl Wilkinson, man!
Oh, my God!

25:44.350 --> 25:48.190
You'd have been All-Pro
if you hadn't beat up them cops!

25:49.360 --> 25:52.860
What I had meant to say was "allegedly"...

25:53.740 --> 25:57.200
...allegedly beat up them cops
and because...

25:57.360 --> 26:01.740
...a good Christian boy like you
would never do nothing like that!

26:02.370 --> 26:03.540
That's right.

26:03.750 --> 26:06.790
The way I heard it,
my man didn't even do nothing anyway!

26:07.000 --> 26:09.380
Them cops were just jealous
of the black man.

26:09.540 --> 26:12.210
Hear what I'm saying?
My boy's been living large!

26:12.420 --> 26:15.720
I can't stand the cops!
I better not see a cop!

26:15.890 --> 26:19.890
-I'll whup a cop's ass! Believe it!
-I'm a cop.

26:27.070 --> 26:28.110
Look!

26:28.570 --> 26:29.820
Bundt cake!

26:32.360 --> 26:36.240
-Look at these yummy little monkeys!
-Hello!

26:36.450 --> 26:37.660
Oh, hey.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.420
Yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.670
-Are you Heather and Dawn?
-Yep, we sure are.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.670
You don't know how excited I am...

26:48.880 --> 26:52.180
...that I actually have some girls
with dance experience!

26:52.390 --> 26:55.720
-I'm excited too!
-I know! Me too, too.

26:56.180 --> 26:59.770
So, Heather, you were in Cats,
which is so terrific...

27:01.650 --> 27:03.110
No, Pussycats.

27:03.320 --> 27:06.360
You know, the club next to the airport?
Pussycats.

27:09.110 --> 27:13.450
-That style of dancing would be...
-Is lap-dancing a style?

27:13.780 --> 27:15.410
No. I mean...

27:15.620 --> 27:18.630
Oh, my God, I forgot to tell you something.

27:18.790 --> 27:19.880
What?

27:20.960 --> 27:22.710
She always does that.

27:26.380 --> 27:28.180
I've seen all I need to see.

27:28.390 --> 27:31.010
No way! I'm so excited!

27:31.220 --> 27:32.180
Go suit up.

27:32.680 --> 27:35.480
-Go down the tunnel and to the left.
-Okay.

27:37.310 --> 27:41.650
If you guys have any friends down
at the club, would you send them over?

27:41.860 --> 27:44.990
-Sure.
-Yeah, absolutely.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.570
Where are you going, Number 48?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.670
I was watching you today.

28:01.670 --> 28:02.840
You looked good.

28:03.010 --> 28:06.550
Good release, strong arm.
You're gonna do fine.

28:06.760 --> 28:07.810
Thanks.

28:08.010 --> 28:09.680
I'm Annabelle Farrell.

28:10.270 --> 28:11.600
-Shane Falco.
-I know.

28:11.810 --> 28:14.980
I remember you
from the '96 Sugar Bowl game.

28:15.190 --> 28:17.860
Didn't anybody have anything
better to do that day?

28:19.530 --> 28:22.280
You should get some help
to turn this back over.

28:22.530 --> 28:26.410
Yeah, I was thinking
I'd call AAA later or something.

28:29.370 --> 28:32.040
-Do you want a lift?
-Yeah.

28:32.250 --> 28:35.090
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.180
Why'd you stay in the pocket at practice?

28:42.390 --> 28:44.930
I don't comment to quarterbacks
about style but...

28:45.140 --> 28:48.600
...you need to keep scrambling
against Detroit, with Prescott back.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.610
-Prescott hasn't crossed.
-He will on Sunday.

28:51.820 --> 28:54.570
-It's a secret so you can't prepare.
-How do you know?

28:54.740 --> 28:57.410
My friend's a cheerleader for Detroit.
She tipped me.

28:57.610 --> 29:00.160
He's left-sided,
shotgun formation, roll right.

29:00.370 --> 29:02.120
Van Gundy's on the right.

29:02.330 --> 29:05.210
He's been All-Pro two years,
but one of my cheerleaders...

29:05.290 --> 29:07.710
...is friends with a girl
who broke up with him.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.300
He's been drinking ever since she left him.

29:10.920 --> 29:14.590
He's hung over! He's a good second
slower off the snap than usual.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.340
I'll stick to the right side.

29:16.550 --> 29:19.140
Unless what they say
about Martinez is true.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.770
-That was fun.
-This is great! You live out here?

29:25.270 --> 29:26.770
Which one's yours?

29:26.940 --> 29:30.360
Here. You see that white yacht
with the satellite dish?

29:31.690 --> 29:34.860
I'm the old houseboat next to it,
covered in seagull shit.

29:36.450 --> 29:37.790
What did you name her?

29:38.120 --> 29:39.450
Phyxsius.

29:39.620 --> 29:43.380
-Phyxsius, what does that mean?
-"Putting to flight."

29:45.790 --> 29:48.340
You want to come onboard for a beer?

29:49.420 --> 29:53.050
Nothing personal,
but I don't date football players.

29:53.470 --> 29:55.010
I don't blame you.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.770
Not even quarterbacks?

29:56.970 --> 30:01.520
Especially not quarterbacks.
You guys are the biggest babies of all.

30:01.730 --> 30:03.480
The biggest babies?

30:03.770 --> 30:04.980
Yeah.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.650
-Thanks for the ride.
-Good luck on Sunday.

30:09.990 --> 30:12.200
-Be careful out there.
-I will.

30:23.210 --> 30:24.050
Shane.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.170
What's up?

30:27.050 --> 30:28.340
Just...

30:29.640 --> 30:30.890
...watching the game.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.680
Nervous?

30:35.850 --> 30:36.980
No.

30:37.690 --> 30:38.730
I'm good.

30:39.860 --> 30:42.030
Like a duck on a pond.

30:42.360 --> 30:45.030
On the surface everything looks calm,
but...

30:45.490 --> 30:48.700
...beneath the water, those feet
are churning a mile a minute.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.370
You'll be fine.

30:52.120 --> 30:55.080
Find a way to lead your team.
Earn their respect.

30:55.830 --> 30:57.000
Yeah.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.050
How are you doing?

31:02.050 --> 31:03.090
Me?

31:05.010 --> 31:07.300
I'm just another duck on the pond.

31:09.970 --> 31:12.020
Coach, can I ask you a question?

31:13.690 --> 31:16.070
-Yeah, shoot.
-Why me?

31:19.570 --> 31:22.240
I look at you and I see two men...

31:22.450 --> 31:25.450
...the man you are,
and the man you ought to be.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.000
Someday, those two will meet.

31:28.790 --> 31:31.040
Should make for a hell of a football player.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.550
Get some sleep, kiddo.

31:38.380 --> 31:40.550
You play professional football tomorrow.

31:57.610 --> 32:00.240
Welcome to Nextel Stadium,
in our nation's capital.

32:00.450 --> 32:03.370
I'm Pat Summerall and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

32:03.450 --> 32:07.540
Detroit bought an entire semi-pro team
once the strike happened.

32:07.750 --> 32:10.420
Washington is going with
a bunch of unknowns.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.840
Although we'll see a few guys
we know today.

32:13.050 --> 32:16.720
Like Shane Falco, that talented quarterback
who fell out of sight...

32:16.930 --> 32:19.430
...after a disastrous showing
in the Sugar Bowl.

32:25.850 --> 32:28.110
Having a little snacky-poo
before the game?

32:28.730 --> 32:31.900
-It does the body good.
-You are one crazy son of a bitch.

32:32.490 --> 32:34.160
-You know how I know that?
-How?

32:34.240 --> 32:37.160
Only a crazy son of a bitch
would eat eggs before a game!

32:37.240 --> 32:38.700
I need to bulk up.

32:38.910 --> 32:40.200
-You want one?
-No!

32:40.410 --> 32:41.830
It's good for you.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.050
Sentinels, listen up.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.770
Welcome to professional football.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.270
Some will say
that your accomplishments...

33:04.480 --> 33:09.110
...will soon be forgotten, you're not
real players, this isn't a real team.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.410
And I say that is bullshit!

33:12.160 --> 33:16.160
Because, as of today,
you're all professional football players.

33:16.370 --> 33:20.330
You're being paid to play.
I want you to remember that because...

33:20.500 --> 33:24.130
...the men whose places you've taken
forgot that a long time ago.

33:25.300 --> 33:26.510
Bring it in here.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.430
Bring it in, guys.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.890
Let's play some football!

33:31.100 --> 33:32.810
-D.C.
-All right!

33:33.220 --> 33:35.680
For some of these players,
this is another shot...

33:35.810 --> 33:37.900
...and a last shot for a guy like Falco.

33:38.020 --> 33:40.440
Remember that beating he took
from Florida?

33:41.770 --> 33:46.070
That's nothing compared to those beatings
he took in Seattle.

33:46.280 --> 33:49.570
One thing we do know
is that Falco can take a hit.

33:49.780 --> 33:53.370
Well, I'll tell you,
he's sure had a lot of practice at it.

33:59.800 --> 34:04.220
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington Sentinels!

34:10.389 --> 34:12.940
-Did you see that?
-That's a pretty good hit.

34:14.060 --> 34:18.570
Will the medical trainers
please report to the east tunnel?

34:23.070 --> 34:25.409
Maybe he was a little overanxious, huh?

34:28.159 --> 34:31.750
And now,
the rest of the Washington Sentinels.

34:53.270 --> 34:54.730
Kick-off!

35:01.990 --> 35:04.370
Not bad, let's go!

35:06.290 --> 35:09.920
There can only be one leader
out there, all right? You be it.

35:20.010 --> 35:22.140
-That's where I stand.
-No, it's not.

35:22.350 --> 35:24.690
-That's my spot in the huddle.
-It's not.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.560
-Get to your spot.
-Let's go, chopstick!

35:28.230 --> 35:30.230
Let's play football! What do you say?

35:35.990 --> 35:39.330
-It's my spot now!
-Not for long, you tub of rice shit!

35:39.740 --> 35:40.910
What's the problem?

35:41.330 --> 35:43.120
You can't do jack shit!

35:43.580 --> 35:46.500
-Pork rice!
-I'm Japanese, not Chinese!

35:46.710 --> 35:48.250
Don't mess with my brother.

35:48.460 --> 35:49.920
What's going on?

35:50.170 --> 35:53.090
Something seems to be going on
in the huddle.

35:55.300 --> 35:57.100
Falco's on his back.

35:57.310 --> 35:59.810
They haven't had a play yet
and Falco's down.

36:00.060 --> 36:04.190
He got hit by his own guy! He was
looking out his earhole for a minute!

36:04.360 --> 36:05.980
This isn't a good sign.

36:06.860 --> 36:10.530
-Am I hurt already?
-Your partner knocked your head off.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.030
Let's go.

36:14.370 --> 36:15.790
Come on, get it together!

36:17.790 --> 36:21.380
I'm the quarterback.
I'm the only one who talks in the huddle.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.750
-But he was in my spot.
-I don't give a shit!

36:23.840 --> 36:25.050
Now huddle up.

36:31.090 --> 36:34.430
If you've got something to say,
raise your hand.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.060
Is that understood?

36:38.390 --> 36:40.650
Suppose you don't feel good,
or you're hurt.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.940
Tell me before the huddle starts. Okay?

36:43.940 --> 36:45.110
Okay, here we go.

36:45.820 --> 36:48.410
DC Right, Switch, 25 Blast.

36:49.700 --> 36:50.780
What?

36:51.280 --> 36:52.950
-That's to the left?
-The right.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.250
To the left!

36:57.250 --> 36:59.790
Be quiet or they'll hear us, and then what?

37:03.590 --> 37:04.880
Play game!

37:05.090 --> 37:08.100
Number 16 on the offense! Five yards!

37:08.800 --> 37:10.680
Well Pat, so far the Sentinels...

37:10.890 --> 37:13.810
...have minus 10 yards offensively.

37:14.270 --> 37:17.520
I've seen monkey-shit fights
at the zoo more organized than this!

37:20.110 --> 37:23.280
DC Right, Pro, 424 Tomahawk,
on one, on one. Ready?

37:32.370 --> 37:33.460
Ready?

37:36.000 --> 37:37.630
I'm coming for you, Footsteps!

37:40.170 --> 37:41.760
Green 22!

37:42.470 --> 37:43.680
Hut! Hut!

37:46.560 --> 37:47.640
Come on, Shane!

37:52.060 --> 37:54.900
You could hear Falco's fillings
drop all the way up here!

37:55.110 --> 37:58.990
Detroit takes over the football
with excellent field position.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.740
Give me an S!

38:00.990 --> 38:02.450
Give me an E!

38:02.660 --> 38:04.120
Give me an N!

38:04.330 --> 38:05.750
Give me a T!

38:05.950 --> 38:07.000
Give me an..."

38:07.120 --> 38:08.750
I! "

38:10.210 --> 38:12.130
We'll get them next time.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.550
Eagle over, cover four!

38:19.800 --> 38:21.100
On three, get ready!

38:23.850 --> 38:26.190
All day, blue eyes!
It's Christmas morning...

38:26.350 --> 38:29.020
...and Santa's coming down the chimney!

38:29.190 --> 38:32.940
I'm gonna bury your family!
I'm gonna bury your dog!

38:34.320 --> 38:35.360
Champ, champ!

38:40.370 --> 38:41.580
Now that's football!

38:41.660 --> 38:43.410
You get it? You like it?

38:46.330 --> 38:49.920
The Sentinels have set a record
for penalties in the first three minutes!

38:50.130 --> 38:54.010
-We're still waiting for the stats on that.
-Personal foul!

38:54.180 --> 38:58.890
Number 56 on the defense!
Half the distance to the goal!

38:59.100 --> 39:01.600
Bateman on that one.
That was just a cheap shot.

39:01.810 --> 39:05.860
-That should be worse than a penaIty.
-They're walking right through us!

39:10.650 --> 39:12.070
Touchdown, Detroit!

39:17.410 --> 39:18.660
Don't worry about it.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.890
Let's go!

39:41.440 --> 39:43.270
Double-slot Zag, okay?

39:43.480 --> 39:45.530
-What?
-I don't feel too good.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.740
-Suck it up.
-Come on!

39:48.410 --> 39:49.700
Jesus Christ!

39:54.620 --> 39:56.080
-Eggs!
-That's ripe!

39:58.330 --> 39:59.750
What'd you eat, man?

39:59.920 --> 40:02.760
If we don't move,
I'm going to blow chow, too.

40:02.960 --> 40:06.930
We're in a huddle! Double-slot zag, 88...

40:09.260 --> 40:10.350
Jesus!

40:11.310 --> 40:12.350
Goddamn!

40:12.430 --> 40:16.440
I tried to tell you, I can't be around
somebody puking or I start puking.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.150
Shit.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.150
Okay, okay!

40:21.360 --> 40:22.440
On three...

40:23.780 --> 40:27.240
...everyone move left. Ready?
Hut, hut, hut.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.080
What the hell is that?

40:34.120 --> 40:35.170
What?

40:37.540 --> 40:40.470
John, how many years have we been
calling games together?

40:40.630 --> 40:41.760
Nineteen, I think.

40:41.970 --> 40:43.680
Ever seen anything like that?

40:46.180 --> 40:47.520
Not on a football field.

40:48.810 --> 40:50.810
-What are they doing?
-Beats me.

40:51.020 --> 40:55.400
Look at it this way. It's the first thing
we've done together as a team.

40:55.650 --> 40:58.030
-Hey!
-Clean it up! Let's go!

40:58.490 --> 40:59.440
Break!

41:13.090 --> 41:15.260
Ready? Blue 42!

41:18.260 --> 41:19.840
Blue 42!

41:21.350 --> 41:22.430
Hut!

41:39.990 --> 41:42.160
First down, Washington.

41:43.290 --> 41:46.040
-Was it out of bounds?
-Yes, on 23.

41:47.170 --> 41:51.170
-Blue Right, 60, X Post.
-Blue Right, 60, X Post!

41:51.800 --> 41:53.380
Let's go, let's go!

41:54.090 --> 41:55.890
Go, from four. Hut!

42:10.070 --> 42:12.030
Now we're rolling!

42:12.570 --> 42:14.910
Signs of life from Washington here.

42:15.070 --> 42:19.370
That last completion by Falco
puts them back in field-goal range.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.540
-Field goal, let's go!
-Field goal.

42:21.750 --> 42:22.620
Nigel.

42:25.040 --> 42:29.550
It's over the bar, not under.
Okay? Go get 'em.

42:30.090 --> 42:32.760
-Hold that.
-Here comes the field-goal team.

42:32.930 --> 42:36.430
A 40-yard attempt for kicker Nigel Gruff,
against the wind.

42:36.600 --> 42:41.360
Here's a guy from Wales,
and he's kicking his first field goal ever.

42:42.020 --> 42:43.400
This is a tough distance.

42:59.460 --> 43:02.340
Yeah, she's there! She's there!

43:02.960 --> 43:06.470
-Boom! Boom!
-Nigel Gruff kicks and scores!

43:06.680 --> 43:11.180
Halftime score: Washington 3, Detroit 14.

43:23.570 --> 43:26.490
That's the second time
a Washington player has been...

43:26.660 --> 43:29.990
-...knocked out by his own teammate.
-There's a rule in sports:

43:30.160 --> 43:33.500
Don't do anything great if you can't handle
the congratulations.

43:33.960 --> 43:35.500
-There is?
-Yup.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.000
Give me an S!

43:38.250 --> 43:39.840
Give me an E!

43:40.010 --> 43:41.510
Give me an N!

43:41.800 --> 43:43.300
Give me a T!

43:43.930 --> 43:45.300
Give me a...

43:52.980 --> 43:55.110
Watch the wheel!

44:02.070 --> 44:03.530
All right, let's go!

44:12.420 --> 44:15.920
Touchdown, Smith! That one gets
the Sentinels back into the game.

44:16.130 --> 44:19.010
This guy is a heck of a player,
but I don't know him.

44:19.220 --> 44:22.260
According to the Sentinels,
it says Ray Smith is...

44:22.470 --> 44:25.060
That's weird!
No college given, no high school.

44:25.310 --> 44:28.310
Just says he's been a resident
of the State of Maryland...

44:28.390 --> 44:31.310
...for the last two years,
and he likes to embroider!

44:31.520 --> 44:34.320
-He does some fancy work with the ball.
-Weird.

44:41.410 --> 44:42.580
Ready!

44:46.120 --> 44:47.290
Green 11!

44:47.960 --> 44:49.590
Green 11!

44:55.760 --> 44:58.260
Falco's sacked and the ball comes loose.

44:58.470 --> 45:01.430
It's Detroit's ball
with only a minute remaining.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.100
Let's go! Let's go!

45:05.060 --> 45:06.690
Danny, Danny.

45:07.060 --> 45:09.020
I need that ball. Get me the ball.

45:09.270 --> 45:10.360
You need the ball.

45:10.610 --> 45:12.070
-Get me the ball.
-The ball.

45:12.150 --> 45:13.780
Are you gonna get me the ball?

45:18.700 --> 45:20.540
I hope he doesn't kill somebody.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.500
I'm back! I'm back!

45:24.750 --> 45:26.290
Get the ball!

45:42.560 --> 45:44.020
I got it!

45:44.610 --> 45:46.860
Now that is all-Madden team!

45:47.110 --> 45:48.700
-You're the man.
-I'm the man!

45:48.780 --> 45:51.530
-You got me the ball.
-I got you the ball!

45:58.080 --> 46:00.080
-Go sit down now, Danny.
-Okay.

46:01.790 --> 46:05.590
-Number 56 recovers the ball.
-Falco!

46:06.510 --> 46:09.050
We've gotta pass.
It's gotta be in the end zone.

46:09.260 --> 46:12.680
DC Right, Zig, 90 Eagle. You can do this.

46:12.890 --> 46:15.270
All right? Let's do it! Come on!

46:29.200 --> 46:31.830
-Blue 25!
-Here comes the pain, baby!

46:32.040 --> 46:34.410
Blue 25!

46:37.290 --> 46:38.840
-Check!
-What are you doing?

46:39.380 --> 46:40.260
Check!

46:42.720 --> 46:44.010
Black 32!

46:44.220 --> 46:46.090
-What?
-He's changing the play.

46:46.180 --> 46:48.470
He's checking off the run.
I told him to pass!

46:53.560 --> 46:54.400
Shit!

47:20.010 --> 47:23.260
Falco calls an audible
at the line of scrimmage...

47:23.470 --> 47:27.270
...and Cochran almost has a touchdown!
What a heartbreaker for Washington.

47:35.820 --> 47:39.280
Final score: Washington 10, Detroit 14.

47:39.360 --> 47:42.790
If I'd wanted Cochran to have that ball,
I'd have called it that way.

47:42.870 --> 47:44.580
-I read blitz.
-Bullshit.

47:44.750 --> 47:47.750
I put the game in your hands.
You got scared.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.080
I read blitz.

47:53.670 --> 47:56.630
Winners always want the ball
when the game's on the line.

48:33.590 --> 48:36.970
WFAN, the Sports Fan's Show.
How do you feel about the strike?

48:37.180 --> 48:41.770
The fans are getting screwed. I've got
season tickets I can't give away!

48:41.980 --> 48:45.650
-What about the replacement players?
-They're nobodies.

48:53.530 --> 48:56.700
"At first I was afraid
I was petrified

48:56.910 --> 49:00.880
"Kept thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side

49:01.080 --> 49:05.170
"But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong

49:05.380 --> 49:06.470
"And I grew strong"

49:06.670 --> 49:09.050
Why'd you play that dumb-ass song?

49:09.260 --> 49:11.850
I put on The Commodores.
That shit just came on.

49:12.220 --> 49:14.850
Can somebody please cut that bullshit off?

49:15.520 --> 49:19.440
-We did the best we could do.
-You don't get points for trying.

49:19.650 --> 49:22.070
Let's face it, boys,
we screwed the pooch today.

49:25.150 --> 49:27.160
Hey, there they are!

49:27.410 --> 49:28.870
Ladies and gentlemen...

49:29.070 --> 49:32.120
...your Washington Sentinels!

49:35.080 --> 49:39.380
He's the luckiest guy here. At least
he couldn't hear the booing today!

49:41.090 --> 49:43.720
Hello! Anyone home? Did I hear an echo?

49:44.550 --> 49:47.260
Where'd McGinty get Rain Man?
The Special Olympics?

49:47.390 --> 49:50.970
No wonder they couldn't win.
He can't even order a drink!

49:56.100 --> 49:57.820
-Iay off.
-Iighten up.

49:58.020 --> 49:59.480
It's not like he can hear.

49:59.730 --> 50:00.780
I can.

50:06.280 --> 50:07.330
What's that say?

50:08.410 --> 50:12.250
"One good thing about being deaf,
you can ignore the assholes."

50:13.580 --> 50:16.460
You asshole.

50:18.210 --> 50:19.260
That's funny.

50:25.350 --> 50:27.020
It's cool!

50:29.770 --> 50:31.060
You had enough?

50:32.400 --> 50:35.610
You've got shit for brains,
but you've got balls.

50:35.780 --> 50:36.780
Thank you.

50:38.780 --> 50:42.410
Danny, remember what I told you
about red shirts in practice?

50:42.490 --> 50:43.120
Yeah.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.040
-Forget about it.
-Okay.

50:45.250 --> 50:46.410
Martel.

50:53.630 --> 50:57.050
Who's the man? Who's the man?

50:57.260 --> 50:58.840
Come on! Come on!

51:03.930 --> 51:06.020
Come on, come on! Stop!

51:07.690 --> 51:09.650
Let's play football, bitch!

51:14.740 --> 51:16.820
We are all God's children here!

51:29.670 --> 51:33.550
"And deliver thee into the hands
of brutish men"...

51:39.560 --> 51:41.730
Ezekiel 21 :31 .

51:46.860 --> 51:48.690
This is some more bullshit!

51:48.860 --> 51:50.860
It's more of a homecoming for you.

51:51.030 --> 51:52.950
You gonna be a funny man?

51:53.160 --> 51:56.200
Bateman! Wilkinson!
Come on, guys, what are you doing?

51:57.410 --> 51:59.040
Can't we all just get along?

52:02.380 --> 52:03.380
Come on.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.880
Why are we the only ones in this jail?

52:07.050 --> 52:10.390
-Simple. They're winners.
-Hell, no. Not tonight.

52:10.550 --> 52:14.180
That was pretty sweet,
you sitting on Wilson's head, Jumbo.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.060
Thanks, Jamal.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.650
He wasn't the only one
who kicked ass tonight.

52:25.740 --> 52:28.160
You're the man tonight, Clifford Franklin!

52:29.870 --> 52:30.910
What?

52:30.990 --> 52:33.410
You were hiding behind the jukebox.
Wasn't he?

52:37.000 --> 52:40.590
At first, I admit, I was afraid.

52:41.550 --> 52:44.550
-Shit, I was petrified.
-You were petrified?

52:44.880 --> 52:47.510
"Thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side"

52:48.720 --> 52:51.350
-The Lord is by your side.
-Have mercy.

52:52.060 --> 52:56.060
"And then I spent so many nights
thinkin' how you did me wrong

52:58.230 --> 52:59.820
"And I grew strong"

53:00.110 --> 53:02.360
You know I hate this damn song.

53:02.570 --> 53:05.410
"I learned how to get along
And so you're back

53:05.570 --> 53:07.410
"from outer space

53:07.580 --> 53:11.580
"I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face

53:11.750 --> 53:15.670
"I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key

53:15.920 --> 53:19.800
"If I'd have known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

53:20.010 --> 53:21.180
"Go on, now, go

53:22.050 --> 53:23.430
"Walk out the door

53:24.090 --> 53:27.810
"Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore"

53:28.180 --> 53:29.230
Remember this?

53:29.310 --> 53:32.100
"Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

53:32.270 --> 53:36.780
"Did I crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

53:36.940 --> 53:39.780
"Oh, no, not l
I will survive

53:41.030 --> 53:44.580
"As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

53:44.790 --> 53:48.460
"I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

53:48.960 --> 53:50.460
"And I'll survive

53:50.830 --> 53:52.000
"I will survive

53:53.090 --> 53:54.630
"Hey, hey!

54:09.940 --> 54:13.230
"It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart

54:13.570 --> 54:17.530
"Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart

54:17.740 --> 54:21.740
"And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself

54:21.950 --> 54:25.830
"I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

54:26.000 --> 54:28.750
-"And you see me"
-Four, five!

54:30.960 --> 54:32.010
Okay, all right.

54:36.430 --> 54:37.550
Frankie.

54:42.980 --> 54:46.520
If anything like this bar fight
happens again...

54:46.730 --> 54:49.480
...there'll be no place
on the team for any of you.

54:51.030 --> 54:53.950
-Do I make myself perfectly clear?
-Yes, sir.

54:54.450 --> 54:56.200
Just for the record...

54:57.370 --> 55:00.710
...l would've loved to have seen
Martel get his ass kicked.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.210
Let's get out of here!

55:10.130 --> 55:11.300
Hey, Shane.

55:13.390 --> 55:14.850
What are you doing?

55:15.310 --> 55:16.470
My job.

55:17.560 --> 55:21.310
-You're a professional football player.
-Sure, this week.

55:21.610 --> 55:24.070
When that's all over, you know...

55:24.270 --> 55:27.860
...I'll be back here.
I don't want to lose my customers.

55:29.490 --> 55:32.490
I was on my way to work.
Do you need a ride?

55:32.780 --> 55:33.950
I'm good.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.250
-I got my truck back.
-How is it?

55:38.830 --> 55:42.170
Flatter. But it runs.

55:44.300 --> 55:47.470
And you?
How are you running after last night?

55:49.510 --> 55:50.760
You heard about that?

55:51.010 --> 55:53.230
I think the whole town heard about that.

55:53.430 --> 55:55.640
Is that from the game or the fight?

55:56.690 --> 55:59.940
I'm not sure. It's all blurred
into one big beating.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.780
The good news is,
you guys got into a rhythm...

56:04.030 --> 56:07.530
...apart from that vomiting thing,
which was on Sports Center.

56:07.990 --> 56:09.160
Oh, God.

56:10.040 --> 56:12.250
After that, the team was really clicking.

56:14.210 --> 56:16.250
Yeah, it was starting to come together.

56:16.500 --> 56:17.500
Yeah.

56:19.800 --> 56:22.260
-You want to sit down?
-No, I should go.

56:23.840 --> 56:25.300
Thanks for coming by.

56:27.220 --> 56:29.270
-Wow. Ow.
-What?

56:29.470 --> 56:31.020
Oh! Ow!

56:31.560 --> 56:32.810
Jesus!

56:33.020 --> 56:35.770
-It looks worse than it feels.
-It looks like hell.

56:36.400 --> 56:39.740
-Then it looks exactly like it feels.
-Here.

56:42.820 --> 56:43.990
Wild yam?

56:44.240 --> 56:45.330
Yeah.

56:45.910 --> 56:50.880
Don't laugh, it works.
It's great for sore muscles and bruises.

56:51.540 --> 56:54.550
-I use it all the time.
-You don't have to do that.

56:54.840 --> 56:58.680
Will you put it on? You can barely move.
This will be a little bit...

56:58.880 --> 57:01.430
-Cold!
-Sorry, sorry.

57:03.100 --> 57:04.720
Here, your shoulders.

57:08.310 --> 57:09.400
Better?

57:09.730 --> 57:10.900
Better.

57:21.030 --> 57:23.410
You're the first player I can remember...

57:23.620 --> 57:26.290
...who cares more about his teammates
than himself.

57:27.920 --> 57:31.590
That's something this team's been
missing for a really long time.

57:33.130 --> 57:35.260
It's a good thing you did last night.

57:36.140 --> 57:37.300
It was just stupid.

57:40.810 --> 57:41.980
Thanks.

57:46.190 --> 57:48.730
-I'm gonna be late for work.
-Practice?

57:48.980 --> 57:50.360
No, actually, I have work.

57:50.780 --> 57:54.700
We only make $50 a game.
Gotta pay the bills, right?

57:54.950 --> 57:58.370
Mac's, down on A Street.
Come in, I'll buy you a beer.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.500
All right, I'll do that.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.710
Keep putting that yam on.

58:23.610 --> 58:24.770
Guys!

58:33.330 --> 58:34.950
You gotta be kidding.

58:35.410 --> 58:37.200
I didn't park in your space.

58:37.460 --> 58:39.330
No, no.

58:39.580 --> 58:42.420
But, unfortunately,
you did park in Lamont's space.

58:42.790 --> 58:47.680
-He's not nearly as lenient as I am.
-On three, fellas.

58:54.890 --> 58:58.900
-We got this. We got this.
-You want to put the car back?

58:59.070 --> 59:00.940
This is none of your business.

59:01.730 --> 59:02.980
Shane is our business.

59:03.240 --> 59:06.070
-We're the guards.
-And we protect our quarterback.

59:08.780 --> 59:12.200
This is funny to them bozos.
You got a joke? You got a joke?

59:12.620 --> 59:14.920
That's your ride right there, ain't it?

59:15.920 --> 59:16.750
Yeah.

59:22.680 --> 59:23.930
That's my windshield!

59:24.090 --> 59:26.350
-Now, put the car back.
-Son of a bitch!

59:27.260 --> 59:28.520
Son of a...

59:28.890 --> 59:32.390
Oh, son of a bitch? I'm a son of a bitch?

59:34.650 --> 59:36.190
Stop, stop!

59:36.400 --> 59:37.940
Come on, goddamn it, help me!

59:39.280 --> 59:40.820
You're gonna pay for this!

59:41.030 --> 59:45.160
No, I'm not. Stop messing
with my man, that includes his ride.

59:45.370 --> 59:46.740
And wax that motherfucker.

59:47.330 --> 59:49.200
Give it a tune-up, too.

59:50.960 --> 59:52.580
Ready to go to practice?

59:53.250 --> 59:54.960
Yeah, let's do that.

59:55.170 --> 59:57.550
-How's that arm?
-Good.

59:58.260 --> 59:59.510
What's that smell?

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.050
Wild yam.

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.640
-That's nice.
-You like that?

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:09.270
And so, boys and girls,
if anybody does have any firearms...

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:12.060
...you need to turn them in
as soon as possible.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.650
No questions asked.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:16.450
Understood?

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.830
All right.

01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:26.830
Okay, coach, it's all yours.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:38.350
Last Sunday, I saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could...

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.470
...to win the football game.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:44.640
We lost. Not because of effort or desire...

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:49.110
...but because of lack of leadership
and trust. One's been resolved.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.950
But leadership means nothing
if a team doesn't believe in each other.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.820
Players spend years together
before they develop trust.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.660
I'm asking you to do it in a week,
not a reasonable request, but...

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:03.120
...these aren't reasonable times.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.050
I know you all have concerns
about this Sunday.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.130
But a real man...

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.020
...admits his fears.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.810
I'm asking you to do that here, tonight.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.820
Who wants to start?

01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:28.570
Let's talk about fears.

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.700
Fears.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.870
I'm scared of spiders, coach.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.250
-That's not what I meant.
-I'm afraid of spiders, too.

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:47.300
Goddamn spiders freak me, too, fellas.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.180
Well, I didn't mean that.

01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:53.470
Ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm?

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:55.560
-Crawling on you?
-Damn!

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:59.060
Thanks, Jumbo. You can just
rock me to sleep tonight.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.030
Okay, that's great, but I'm talking
about what scares us on the field.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.950
Like spiders on the field?

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.120
Can we get beyond the spiders, please?

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:13.580
Bees.

01:02:14.410 --> 01:02:15.420
Bees?

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.040
-Bees?
-Bees.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.760
Anybody here afraid
of anything other than insects?

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:24.470
Come on.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:26.600
Quicksand.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.140
Shit, yeah!
Quicksand's a scary mother, man.

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:34.770
It sucks you right in and even
if you scream, you get that muck...

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.770
I don't think that's it.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.320
That's not what he had in mind.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:43.240
-What's he talking about, then?
-Ask him.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:47.490
What's up, Shane?

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:51.750
You're playing...

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:56.630
...and you think everything is going fine.
But then one thing goes wrong...

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.970
...and another...

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.510
...and another.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.310
You try to fight back, but the harder
you fight, the deeper you sink.

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.520
Until you can't move.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.900
You can't breathe...

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:14.690
...because you're in over your head...

01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:17.900
...like quicksand.

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:28.420
That's some deep shit.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.880
Anything else you're afraid of?

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.010
-Going back to the mini-mart.
-The shipping yard.

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.350
The auto plant.

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:41.180
Prison.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.470
Yeah, all right.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.070
The truth is,
you guys have been given something...

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.150
...that every athlete dreams of:

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.320
A second chance.

01:03:57.030 --> 01:03:58.740
And you're afraid of blowing it.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:00.700
We all are.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:03.790
But now our fear is shared
and we can overcome it together.

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:07.790
Let's lose that fear this Sunday
and put it into San Diego!

01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:09.710
Come on!

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:22.060
Another vicious hit
by the All-Pro Hank Morris.

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.020
That's his third of the game.

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.900
It's just me, dickhead.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:29.150
I tell you,
he is really putting a hurt on Falco.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.240
I'm not sure how much more
of this abuse he can take.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.120
Huddle up!

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.700
Huddle up!

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.830
Same play, except let Morris by.
Nobody touch him.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.250
-It's 16-0 already.
-I said let him through!

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.840
Get some penetration, Morris!
Get some penetration!

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:52.850
Blue 88!

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:07.740
Now, that is a hit!

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:13.000
Holy shit!

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.370
Let's haul ass, round boy!
Follow me! Follow me!

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.170
Holy shit!

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:27.510
Go!

01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:29.470
Jump on his back!

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:32.270
Here it comes! I'm coming through!

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.310
Jump on his back!

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.440
Fumiko scores!

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:43.990
I love to see a fat guy score!

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.530
Why?

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:49.790
Because you get a fat-guy spike,
and then you get a fat-guy dance.

01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:54.710
Pork rice!

01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:01.590
That's not in the playbook.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.680
Yeah.

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.010
Maybe we should put it in.

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.020
Kick-off!

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.850
So, Annabelle, what do you, like,
think of our friends?

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.230
I think...

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:49.730
...they're friendly.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.610
I know! Aren't they?

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:53.440
Yeah.

01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:07.250
We'll stretch them right here.

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.090
Green 95!

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:16.600
Green...

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.390
...95!

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600
What the hell?

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:30.820
Start the ball! Get the ball off!

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:34.450
Hold the play clock.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:41.790
Start the ball on the play clock.

01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:51.220
False start on the offense.

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:54.970
Number 72, Number 77, Number 60...

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.230
...Number 61, Number 87 and Number 53.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.690
Five yards.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.770
Still first down.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:06.070
That's bullshit! The one girl slapped
the other girl on the ass, Jimmy.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.450
You're killing me!

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:10.660
You want to see mine?
I got something for you.

01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:20.340
-Here we go.
-Don't throw it!

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:30.930
Damn it! They did it again!

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.850
Ray Smith with the interception.

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:37.189
First down, Washington.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:41.529
-Nice going!
-You're killing me!

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.859
-Defense, get out there!
-Iet's go.

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:49.370
Stop her from shaking her ass
for two minutes!

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.910
98 Shake.

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:53.330
98 Shake!

01:08:58.090 --> 01:08:59.420
Green 99!

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:22.740
Not bad, Falco.

01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:28.250
Touchdown, Brian Murphy.

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:34.380
Everybody in the stadium knows
that an onside kick is coming...

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.550
...with 55 seconds left on the clock.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.010
With just 55 seconds left,
Washington has to recover the ball...

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.020
...call a time-out fast, so Gruff
will have a shot at a field goal.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.189
Big Bateman ends up with the ball!

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:54.530
Danny, go down!

01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:57.160
No one's gonna tackle him.

01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:58.870
He's reversing his field!

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.870
He's forgot the clock's running out.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.580
Well, he's trying to run out the clock.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.080
Danny, go down!
You're using up the clock!

01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:11.130
You won't see that every day.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.800
Time out! Time out!

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.390
Nice hit, Shane!

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.350
What do you think?

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:22.140
We don't stop the clock, it's over.

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:23.940
Give me a chance, I'm bored.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.440
You're looking at a 65-yard field goal.

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:31.490
You just hold it,
and I'll kick the bloody piss out of it.

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.030
What the hell?

01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:36.450
What the hell!

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:38.290
Field goal!

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:49.920
McGinty's gonna let Gruff
try this field goal from 65 yards out!

01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:52.180
I don't know if he has enough leg.

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:54.100
I think he's smoking on the field.

01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:56.720
Smoking? I'm sure you just imagined that.

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.940
No, I saw the smoke and everything.

01:11:12.490 --> 01:11:14.200
Vito! Look who's on TV!

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:17.790
He wants to keep his pub,
he's gonna stop blowing some kicks!

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.500
I'm telling you, that's him.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.530
It's straight enough.
lf it's got the distance...

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:53.120
It has the distance! It's good!
Washington wins!

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:59.920
The 65-yard field-goal attempt
is good by Nigel Gruff.

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:08.180
Final score: Washington 17, San Diego 16.

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:18.240
-You're the man!
-Oh, bollocks!

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:23.030
Come here!

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.210
Sorry, man. Sorry, excuse me.

01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:32.750
All right. Good game.
We snuck by on that one.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.420
-I'll take it.
-All right.

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.220
I'll take it. Congrats.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.060
-What do you think of the new team?
-It's great!

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:45.770
These guys are like us.

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:49.230
This strike ain't about guys like me.
It's about them superstars...

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:52.900
...who want $8 million
instead of $7 million. To hell with them.

01:12:53.150 --> 01:12:57.160
This is the most fun I've had
in football in years. Go Falco!

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:01.580
All right. Let's go, baby, let's go!

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:05.750
-I love you, Annabelle.
-I know you do, Alan. We're closed.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:08.630
Oh, hey!

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:11.420
-You can come in.
-Come on in, buddy!

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:13.090
You go.

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:14.720
Out, out!

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:16.130
You're Shane Falco.

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:20.560
-Way to go. You guys kick ass!
-Thanks.

01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:23.980
-Way to go.
-Bye! Take care.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:25.940
Hi.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.650
Sure it's okay? I don't want to get you
in trouble with your boss.

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.570
No, she won't mind.

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:36.780
Come on in. You want a beer?

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.160
Sure.

01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:43.210
We were so tight.
We had so much fun in here.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.630
Since I was five years old,
I've been sitting on those stools.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.590
And then after he died, I took over.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:54.430
Is that you and him?

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.970
Yeah.

01:13:59.350 --> 01:14:02.060
He was the biggest Washington fan
you have ever seen.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.360
Other kids got bedtime stories,
I got football stories.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.320
He used to talk all the time...

01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:15.830
...about the glory days of football.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:17.870
Said how they were...

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.830
...gone forever.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.300
I wish he was here to see you guys play.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.180
-I don't know about that.
-I do.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.590
Good game today.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:31.100
Thanks.

01:14:44.490 --> 01:14:45.860
It's late.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:47.990
Yeah.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.660
Us babies need our rest.

01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:54.420
Yeah, you do.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.630
I'm sorry, but between the guys
on the field...

01:14:57.710 --> 01:15:00.800
...and the guys in the bar,
a girI's gotta keep her guard up.

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.050
Yeah, I imagine.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.680
Yeah.

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:08.510
You coming to the game on Sunday?

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.890
No, we don't travel with the team.

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:17.320
Can I see you when I get back?

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:20.940
Sure.

01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:27.540
Good night, Annabelle.

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:30.210
Good night.

01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:19.550
-What do you do here, John?
-You go for it. You have to.

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.310
But Falco's been shut down
by this defense all afternoon.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.320
But I'll tell you this, all it takes...

01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:33.990
...is one big play to get him back
in the ball game.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.990
And here goes Falco.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:52.470
Falco scores! Falco scores!

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.480
Here's Falco. He'll try to reverse pivot,
turn and pitch out here.

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:07.820
But in doing so, his left guard,
André Jackson, is going to pull...

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:10.910
...and Falco will hit him
with the ball in the back.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.830
Then it's gonna flop around the ground.

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:17.540
Here comes Cochran, he'll kick it.
Franklin's gonna pick it up.

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.040
Franklin's gonna get hit right here.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:25.340
The ball will go flying in the air.
Falco will pick it up...

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:28.510
...and the guy who started the play, Falco...

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.470
...will end up with it
in the end zone for a touchdown!

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.640
-Welcome to strike football.
-And the fabulous Falco.

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.770
If they can win against Dallas...

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:41.020
...they'll do what Washington
hasn't done in over seven years:

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:42.440
Get to the playoffs.

01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:54.330
Call time out! Time out!

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:55.500
Time out!

01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:58.420
Time out Washington.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.130
Franklin, come here, come here, come on.

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.340
I thought I had it...

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.680
Shut up. Give me the Stick 'em.

01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:09.260
-That's illegal.
-Think you'll go to football jail?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:12.140
Now, you know this don't look natural.

01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:16.190
Don't talk. We'll run the same play.
You'll catch the ball.

01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:18.730
I look like I just jacked off an elephant!

01:18:18.980 --> 01:18:20.320
Say you understand.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.240
I understand.

01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:25.620
Go out there and catch the ball
for a change, all right?

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.880
Damn! This cup is stuck!

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.670
Gonna need some time on this one.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.970
Here we go. Same play.
Pro Right, Switch 9...

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:42.680
Franklin!

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:45.310
I can't get the damn cup off!

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.480
You can do this.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:50.940
It's one on one. Ready?

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:01.700
Ready!

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.410
Blue 89!

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.120
Blue 89!

01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:23.470
Franklin catches the ball!

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:26.560
Who would've thought?
He never catches a ball.

01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:28.440
But he caught the ball!

01:19:28.690 --> 01:19:30.980
That makes the score 21 to 20.

01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:34.950
Conventional wisdom says
kick the extra point, tie the game...

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.700
...and go into overtime.
Especially with the playoffs on the line.

01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:42.870
But Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.830
And McGinty says, "Go for it."

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.580
Let's go for the win!

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:50.760
I need a receiver!

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:54.510
4-22 Y Cross, okay? We gotta have it!

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:03.020
Ready? Go! Ready!

01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:11.860
This kind of situation has not been
Falco's strong point in the past.

01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:14.410
Falco rolls to his left and throws...

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.500
...right into the defender's hands.

01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:22.630
And he drops it right into the unsure hands
of Clifford Franklin!

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.090
Washington wins!

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:28.220
What a lucky break for Shane Falco,
who threw a bad pass...

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.840
...that could've blown the game
for Washington.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.700
Get over it.

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:49.370
It's a win.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.740
Better lucky than good?

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:53.370
Right.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.300
Shane Falco.

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:06.090
-Great game out there today.
-Thanks.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:10.390
To what do you attribute this team's
sudden rise over these past few weeks?

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.390
You know, you should talk to Franklin.
He's the hero today.

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:17.480
Clifford Franklin. Terrific day today.

01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:20.440
Yeah, today was a good day
for Clifford Franklin.

01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:22.820
Clifford Franklin can't wait till tomorrow.

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.620
Clifford Franklin gets better looking
every day.

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:30.410
We're beginning to scratch the surface
of the talents of Clifford Franklin.

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.920
Clifford Franklin has moves even
Clifford Franklin ain't seen yet.

01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:37.460
You showed us a few moves
today against Phoenix...

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:40.220
...but it could be a different story
against Dallas.

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:42.760
That's the same story, different chapter.

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.810
The football is like a one-man cold
to Clifford Franklin.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:51.190
Clifford Franklin's the only one catching it
and coming down with it.

01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:59.820
Cheers, babe.

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:02.030
I think we got it.

01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:05.830
To victory!

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:10.670
Feels good, doesn't it?
One game away from the playoffs?

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.840
And the hunt? That ring's so close
you can almost feel it on your finger.

01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:16.880
-What are you up to?
-What?

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:20.550
I can't get excited about the future
of my team?

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:25.060
Okay, I got some great news.

01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:28.440
Martel and Carr have crossed
the picket line.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.650
With the deal I made them swallow,
I can't afford not to take them back.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.940
No.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:35.820
No what?

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:38.660
I'm sticking with Falco.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.660
Jimmy, come on.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.750
Have you read the newspaper?

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.130
The entire Dallas team
has crossed the picket line.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:49.750
Thanksgiving night
we play the world champions.

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.550
We have a deal.
No interference with my coaching.

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.720
As long as the strike is on,
Falco is my quarterback.

01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:59.890
We have to beat Dallas
to get into the playoffs.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.480
Falco can't do that.
You saw what happened yesterday.

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:05.520
Jesus Christ!

01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:09.030
Do you think he'll have
that luck against Dallas, too?

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.950
-They'll murder him!
-He's just getting his game back.

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:14.570
He falls apart
whenever the game is on the line!

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.080
That's been his rap
ever since the Sugar Bowl.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.210
There are 21 other guys
who put their faith in you to lead them.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.710
They'd be heartbroken
if you abandoned them...

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:27.000
...before the biggest game of their lives.

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:32.550
You really are a son of a bitch,
you know that?

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.520
What are you doing?

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:45.360
I don't want to make
the same mistake I did in Phoenix.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:47.820
We might end up
in that situation with Dallas.

01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:50.990
They like to send their safeties...

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.040
...put the pressure on.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.330
Yeah, coach?

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.830
It's over.

01:23:59.210 --> 01:24:00.290
Martel crossed.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.090
I'm sorry.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.490
"Chokes with the game on the line."
ls that what O'Neil said?

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:33.870
It's okay.

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:36.380
It's better for the team, right?

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.500
I mean, Martel...

01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:42.300
...he is the best. The guy's got it all.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.010
No.

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.890
He doesn't have heart.

01:24:49.060 --> 01:24:50.310
You do.

01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:57.070
It's been a privilege.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.660
Thanks for believing.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.380
You give them hell on Thursday.

01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:45.460
I just wanted to tell you before you left...

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.960
I'm sorry.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.710
-Thanks.
-No, really.

01:25:51.630 --> 01:25:54.090
I think it's terrible
what they do to you guys.

01:25:57.090 --> 01:26:00.850
They make you believe
that you're better than you really are.

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:03.190
Then they pull the rug out from under you.

01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:09.440
The cruelest thing
that they can give guys like you...

01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:11.070
...is hope.

01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:19.410
You're a real class act, Martel...

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.040
...a real class act.

01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:26.340
She deserves better.

01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:31.550
You're a sinking ship.
Don't drag her down with you.

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.970
Take care of my guys.

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:41.900
Come on, boys, let's go!

01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:45.480
Nothing but water left in here. Let's go.

01:26:45.730 --> 01:26:47.360
I have a date.

01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:50.990
-But I love you, Annabelle.
-I know you do, Alan.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.370
'Bye, you guys. Be careful!

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.390
Here he is!

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.640
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.690
...Number 16 in your programs...

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:58.530
...Number 1 in your hearts!

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:01.410
Shane Falco!

01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:05.200
Falco! Falco!

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.790
Cheers. God bless you.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.210
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.220
Are you all right?

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.900
I'm done.

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.060
What?

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:33.730
Martel crossed.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:35.320
Bloody hell.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:38.740
When will you tell the guys?

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.410
-I don't want to ruin...
-No, no, wait.

01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:45.750
Cut that music! Cut it!
Turn the music off! Cut it!

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:48.250
Shane's got something to tell you.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.710
I've got good news.

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:56.510
This Thursday you'll be with
the best quarterback in the league.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.510
Damn right.

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.600
Martel.

01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:04.560
He crossed.

01:29:08.690 --> 01:29:10.280
Martel crossed.

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:17.870
While you guys are getting pounded
by Dallas...

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.290
...just kidding...

01:29:21.710 --> 01:29:24.080
...I'll be drinking beer on my boat.

01:29:24.670 --> 01:29:26.130
Kicking back.

01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:30.470
Sentinels...

01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:33.010
...raise your glasses.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.430
This is to Shane Falco.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.020
He's our quarterback.

01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:40.020
He's our leader.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:44.270
But most of all, he's our friend.
This is for you, man.

01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:45.730
To Falco!

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:50.990
Thanks.

01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:52.870
Thanks.

01:29:54.370 --> 01:29:55.830
It's been fun.

01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:23.350
Welcome back to Nextel Stadium
in our nation's capital.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:26.770
I'm Pat Summerall and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:30.270
It appears that the strike
is coming to a close.

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.440
Martel will be resuming
the quarterback position tonight.

01:31:33.650 --> 01:31:35.860
I gotta admit, I was looking forward...

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:39.320
...to seeing what Falco could do
with one more game.

01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:42.330
He made amazing progress
the past few weeks...

01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:44.580
...under the tutelage of Jimmy McGinty.

01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:45.660
He really did.

01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:50.000
But tonight it'll be Martel
leading Washington against Dallas.

01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:01.770
I never thought I'd say this, but...

01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.770
...I'm gonna kind of miss
those replacement games.

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.940
Bring back Falco!

01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:11.360
ladies and gentlemen,
leading your Washington Sentinels today...

01:32:11.570 --> 01:32:14.910
...welcome back Number 7, Eddie Martel.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.330
Go on, boys!

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.020
Red 21!

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.650
Come on, Martel. Get moving!

01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:49.650
Maybe you should try scrambling.

01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:52.530
Brilliant. How about a quick kick?

01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:12.350
Hey, Butler.

01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.100
-Red 38!
-Hey, man.

01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:20.730
If it ain't any trouble,
I'd love to get your autograph after.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:22.940
You want it, you got it, scab!

01:33:23.190 --> 01:33:24.440
All right.

01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:46.590
Cochran fumbles the ball, Dallas recovers.

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.600
First down and goal on the two-yard line.

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:53.810
Hawk 9, Stay!

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:57.320
Bateman! Hawk 9, Stay!

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.900
Hawk 9, Stay!

01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:02.450
I'm back!

01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:09.620
Touchdown, Dallas.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.960
They're quitting on you!

01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:25.140
Gold 41!

01:34:38.190 --> 01:34:41.120
Pass intended
to Brian Murphy, incomplete.

01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:43.490
Throw right, you're going left!

01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:45.580
Right, right, right.

01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:48.080
You went left, I want you to go right!

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.460
No, right!

01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:51.880
Right, you idiot!

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.720
Hey, easy!

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:20.490
Brian Murphy fumbled the ball.
Dallas recovers.

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.080
Nice hands.

01:35:25.210 --> 01:35:27.500
Three-two Magic, Rack Zero.

01:35:27.710 --> 01:35:29.670
What the hell was that about?

01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:45.980
Touchdown, Dallas.

01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:26.280
Gruff, wake up!

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.580
What the...

01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:40.250
Pass incomplete by Eddie Martel.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.850
What the hell was that?

01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.600
I'm talking to you!

01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:51.430
I call the plays out on the field.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.980
-That's not how I coach.
-I don't give a shit...

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.310
...because that's the way I play.

01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.230
That's the end of the first half...

01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:01.900
...with a score of Dallas 17, Washington 0.

01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:03.110
Coach McGinty!

01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.990
What will Washington need
to get back into this game?

01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:10.160
-Heart.
-I'm sorry?

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:11.920
You've gotta have heart.

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.630
Can you elaborate?

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:17.880
Miles and miles of heart.

01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:22.970
There you have it,
in a word, from Coach McGinty...

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.350
... Washington will need "heart"
to get back into this...

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.020
I ran it like you said!
You just underthrew me!

01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:36.610
This isn't a track meet, asshole.
You have to look for the ball!

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:39.740
I'll pull you off the field, you spoiIt punk.

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.740
Is O'Neil gonna side with a burnout coach
or someone who puts fans in the stands?

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:47.080
Son of a bitch!

01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:51.500
What are you thinking about?
We got a game to play!

01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:54.300
-No one can beat Dallas with these losers!
-I can.

01:37:58.050 --> 01:38:01.470
Falco, great to see you.
Now, get the hell out of my locker room!

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.600
-Coach?
-What took you so long?

01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:05.060
Traffic.

01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.270
Suit up!

01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:08.350
What?

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:12.610
-O'Neil will fire your ass!
-It won't be the first time!

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:14.990
This is bullshit! I'll end this right now.

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.860
Come and get some!

01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:22.700
You big fatty!

01:38:30.710 --> 01:38:32.260
This doesn't change anything.

01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:35.260
I'm an All-Pro quarterback!
I've got two Super Bowl rings!

01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:37.350
You're no more than a replacement.

01:38:37.550 --> 01:38:38.720
Yeah.

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.930
I can live with that.

01:38:44.150 --> 01:38:47.570
My brothers, will somebody
please get this asshole out of here?

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.320
Get your hands off me, you gorilla!

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:05.170
Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy.

01:39:05.630 --> 01:39:09.050
And McGinty says, with the playoffs
on the line, "Go for it. "

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:11.720
Get to the playoffs.
Something Washington...

01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:15.220
...has not been able to do
against Dallas in seven years.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:30.950
Falco?

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:34.580
What the hell is he up to?

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.580
Look, here comes Falco! Falco's back!

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.290
What happened to Martel?

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:41.710
I don't know, but the way Falco's running...

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.510
...and that look he has in his eye,
he thinks he's gonna play.

01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:51.010
I'm sorry.

01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:55.980
They're playing zone out there
and you can pick them apart...

01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.690
...if you keep your eyes open...

01:39:57.770 --> 01:40:02.150
He seems to be necking with
that cheerleader! That's what he's doing!

01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:06.530
Players aren't supposed to be
fraternizing with cheerleaders.

01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:09.410
Yeah, but what are they gonna do?
Fire him?

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.370
-You give me strength.
-You're late for work.

01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:15.960
Kick ass, Falco!

01:40:19.130 --> 01:40:22.300
What's all the celebrating about?
We're down 17-0.

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.140
It's nasty out there.

01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:26.680
That's why girls don't play
the game, coach.

01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:31.140
Listen up. This time tomorrow,
the strike will be officially over.

01:40:31.890 --> 01:40:34.980
Dallas has made a big mistake.
They haven't been afraid of you.

01:40:35.230 --> 01:40:38.570
They should be, because you have
a powerful weapon working for you.

01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.820
There is no tomorrow for you.

01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:43.620
That makes you all very dangerous people!

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.290
Kick ass on one. Ready?

01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:03.890
Clifford Franklin is looking for a new home.

01:41:04.890 --> 01:41:06.520
Ready for some pain?

01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:08.810
-Bring it on.
-It's coming.

01:41:09.190 --> 01:41:10.650
It's coming.

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:12.570
See him coming in motion?

01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:18.490
I've never seen anything like this!

01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:19.870
Unbelievable!

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.870
There's at least five, six flags out there.
Hats, everything!

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:27.540
This is what you call
an old-fashioned melee.

01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:30.840
Unnecessary roughness,
Number 16 and Number 34.

01:41:31.090 --> 01:41:33.840
Fifteen yards, so that's, wait...

01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:36.260
...45...30...

01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:41.020
How many yards so far?

01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:43.520
Who do they think they're playing here?

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.700
Let's go! Come on!

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.600
My knee!

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.440
It's my knee!

01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:26.190
I think I broke it.

01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:32.160
Did I do it? Did I score?

01:42:32.370 --> 01:42:34.910
-Yeah, you did it.
-God, it hurts!

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.080
I'm sorry.

01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:39.670
Don't be sorry. Going out
in front of 80,000 people ain't bad.

01:42:41.170 --> 01:42:43.630
You finish what you started.

01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:50.760
White 24!

01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:09.410
Blue 15! Hut, hut!

01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:40.320
First down, Washington.

01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:44.990
-Good job.
-I got skills.

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:48.290
-Feel like running the ball?
-Better give it to Wilkinson.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:50.210
He's going to jail.

01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.130
-I'll clear the way.
-I'm right behind you.

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.880
We need it!

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:13.280
A gain of 20 yards by Ray Smith.
First down.

01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:22.450
I know you're tired. I know you're hurting.

01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:25.580
I wish I could say something
classy and inspirational...

01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:27.460
...but it wouldn't be our style.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.250
Pain heals.

01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:33.300
Chicks dig scars.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:36.180
Glory lasts forever.

01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:37.590
Right on, Shane.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:40.260
Right on, baby!

01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:42.480
Shotgun, DC Right.

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:45.770
Flip 90, Dig, on the center. Ready?

01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:05.290
We're looking at a different team here
in the second half.

01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:09.510
Absolutely. Washington is playing
like there's no tomorrow...

01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:11.300
...because there isn't.

01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:13.930
Touchdown, baby!

01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:15.180
Son of a bitch!

01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:19.690
Odd bullets, blitz coverage!

01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:32.990
Daniel Bateman comes up
with the big stop on third and one.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.540
That forces a Dallas punt.

01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:39.620
Pat, with 28 seconds remaining,
Washington needs a decent return...

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.170
...in order to give Gruff
a shot to tie the game.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.280
With 12 seconds remaining...

01:46:08.530 --> 01:46:10.990
-It's yours, Nigel.
-...a 32-yard field goal...

01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:13.160
...will send this game into overtime.

01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:16.040
Thirty-two yards is just
a chip shot for Gruff.

01:46:32.230 --> 01:46:33.310
Are you all right?

01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:36.020
I'm sorry.

01:46:36.230 --> 01:46:39.230
I had the money but I pissed it
away down the track again.

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:41.780
What? What are you talking about?

01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:43.780
They'll take my pub away from me.

01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:45.580
It's all I've got.

01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:47.990
Come on, Shane!

01:47:00.930 --> 01:47:04.010
It's a fake! Falco still has it!
He's running with it!

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.320
Touchdown, Falco!

01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:31.880
Holding! Number 68 on the offense.

01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:34.800
Ten-yard penalty. Repeat first down.

01:47:35.010 --> 01:47:36.720
What a terrible call!

01:47:36.970 --> 01:47:38.430
Time out!

01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:44.480
-You okay?
-I broke my arm.

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.730
Cheers. You saved my ass.

01:47:47.310 --> 01:47:48.400
Take care.

01:47:48.650 --> 01:47:51.190
You'll have to explain to me
what that was about.

01:47:53.190 --> 01:47:54.360
What's it gonna be?

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.820
I want the ball.

01:47:57.820 --> 01:47:59.160
Winners always do.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.790
Spread formation.

01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:10.760
Damn!

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:20.100
Sorry, Shane. I'm sorry, everybody.

01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:23.190
No problem.
Just rip someone's head off on this one.

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.480
Consider it done.

01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:28.690
All right. So besides me,
who really wants the ball?

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:31.740
Yeah, you want it, Brian.

01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:35.740
Let's hook up.
DC Left, Wide Motion, 88 War.

01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:37.120
Gentlemen...

01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:44.630
It's been an honor to share
the field of battle with you.

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:13.410
We ain't losing this game.

01:49:34.730 --> 01:49:35.730
Green 86!

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:42.700
Green 86!

01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:21.280
Touchdown, Brian Murphy!

01:50:22.410 --> 01:50:26.080
I knew it! I knew it all along!

01:50:26.290 --> 01:50:29.790
Jimmy, you beautiful son of a bitch!
I knew you could do it!

01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:34.260
Final score: Washington 20, Dallas 17.

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:37.800
Washington goes to the playoffs!

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:48.400
You did it!

01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:50.980
You did it!

01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:02.360
When the replacement players
for the Sentinels left the stadium...

01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:04.570
...there was no ticker-tape parade...

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:07.280
...no endorsement deals for sneakers...

01:52:07.530 --> 01:52:10.370
...or soda pop or breakfast cereal...

01:52:10.570 --> 01:52:12.950
...just a locker to be cleaned out...

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:15.250
...and a ride home to catch.

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:17.370
But what they didn't know...

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:20.380
...was that their lives
would be changed forever...

01:52:20.590 --> 01:52:23.420
...because they had been
part of something great.

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:26.930
And greatness, no matter how brief...

01:52:27.130 --> 01:52:29.100
...stays with a man.

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:32.430
Every athlete dreams of a second chance.

01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:34.890
These men lived it.
