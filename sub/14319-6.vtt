15:41.125 --> 15:42.958
Hand over the box, swamp rat.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.500
You can blast me away
1,000 times,

15:45.500 --> 15:47.958
but I'll get you
sooner or later.

15:47.958 --> 15:49.875
Gambit ain't gonna be your
lapdog.

15:49.875 --> 15:54.458
The Thieves are not your people.
Remy was wise to leave them.

Go now and I'll let you live.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.208
It's no good fighting,
Wolverine.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.458
Unless we find the real tithe
box,

16:14.458 --> 16:17.000
every Thief here will be
destroyed.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
I don't care about which spirit

do what to which Cajuns,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.125

-The time has come!

16:40.250 --> 16:42.708
Ten years have passed.

16:43.291 --> 16:46.250
The tithe is false!

16:46.250 --> 16:52.166
Chosen Ones,
Assassin and Thief,
step forward!

16:55.000 --> 17:00.375
The Guild of Assassins
honors you with this tithe,
great External.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.708
Your tithe is true.

17:03.750 --> 17:08.416
By our covenant,
your powers shall be increased.

17:08.416 --> 17:12.750

No, wait! You must see the
truth.

17:44.875 --> 17:48.083

You Assassins got no honor!

17:52.333 --> 17:55.083
You Assassins betray us!

You dare endanger the sacred
tithe?

18:12.708 --> 18:15.166
You know the price! Thieves!

18:15.833 --> 18:18.958
Your enemy has become mine.

Remy, don't leave me again.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.583
This is not my home.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.583
I am not Thief or Assassin.

18:55.166 --> 18:58.333
I am an X-Man.
And I'm never coming back.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.958
CYCLOPS: I still don't
understand

19:14.958 --> 19:17.291
why he didn't tell us about the
problem
in the first place.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.000
There are parts of our pasts
that

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
that none of us want
our friends to know.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.083
But being an X-Man
should mean something.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.875
Gambit has to trust us.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.333
JEAN: Trust takes time.

an end to this madness?

19:36.458 --> 19:40.708
When I left, the Fall People
were living here peacefully.

Even at the ends of the Earth,

19:43.000 --> 19:46.750
the horrors of war find their
way
into the human heart.

19:46.750 --> 19:50.208
We have seen much suffering
in our lives, Magneto.

19:50.875 --> 19:54.208
Each must find his own way
to fight against it.

19:54.208 --> 19:57.333
Someone named Magneto
once taught us

19:57.333 --> 20:01.458
that the fight goes
to the most powerful!

20:01.458 --> 20:05.458
Barbarus! I did not create you
for this!

20:05.458 --> 20:08.208
We Mutates follow a new master
now,

20:08.208 --> 20:11.250
