12:30.450 --> 12:31.922
I WANTED TO MAKE YOU
 BREAKFAST IN BED,

12:31.922 --> 12:33.353
BUT YOU ACCIDENTALLY
 LOCKED THE DOOR

12:33.353 --> 12:34.454
AND PUT THE DRESSER
 IN FRONT OF IT.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.427
LOOK --
 HEART-SHAPED PANCAKES,

12:37.427 --> 12:39.759
HEART-SHAPED HAM STEAK,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.291
HEART-SHAPED OMELET.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.170
HEY, YOU´RE BREAKING
 ALL MY HEARTS.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.172
HEY, ANGE.
 HEY, GEORGE.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.044
NOW´S NOT A GOOD TIME,
 DUDE.

12:54.044 --> 12:58.178
OH, I GUESS SOMEBODY´S STILL
 CELEBRATING VALENTINE´S DAY.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.450
MAN, SOMEBODY WAS FEELING
 ROMANTIC LAST NIGHT.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.883
THAT PAINTING ON THE GARAGE
 IS PRETTY GOOD.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.954
WHAT PAINTING?

13:03.954 --> 13:07.187
THAT PAINTING OF YOU.

13:12.022 --> 13:14.925
GEORGE, WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.870
ERNIE, WHAT DID I DO?
 TRUST ME. COME ON.

13:21.501 --> 13:26.076
YEAH, I GOTTA SAY, GEORGE,
 YOU DID A GOOD JOB ON THIS.

13:26.076 --> 13:28.808
YOU PAINTED THIS?

13:28.808 --> 13:31.211
HE SURE DID.
 DO YOU LIKE IT?

13:32.983 --> 13:35.245
IT´S NOT GREAT.

13:37.948 --> 13:40.190
BUT SINCE YOU PAINTED IT,

13:40.190 --> 13:42.592
IT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME.

13:42.592 --> 13:45.595
BABY, I JUST WANT YOU
 TO FORGIVE ME.

13:45.595 --> 13:48.358
MARISOL,
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:48.358 --> 13:50.500
I GOTTA TALK TO ERNIE.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.533
THERE WAS A PROBLEM
 WITH THAT THING YOU GAVE ME.

13:53.533 --> 13:57.237
I COUNTED IT IN THE CAR,
 AND IT WAS 50 THINGS SHORT.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.970
MARISOL, IS THAT PAINT
 ON YOUR HANDS?

13:59.970 --> 14:01.111
I DON´T KNOW.

14:01.111 --> 14:03.243
IS THAT PAINT ON MY HANDS,

14:03.243 --> 14:05.615
OR AM I GETTING MY 50 THINGS?

14:05.615 --> 14:09.920
GEORGE, YOU DIDN´T PAINT THIS.
 MARISOL DID,

14:09.920 --> 14:11.181
AND ERNIE PAID HER FOR IT.

14:11.181 --> 14:13.283
NOT YET.

14:13.283 --> 14:15.025
ERNIE JUST SPRANG IT ON ME.

14:15.025 --> 14:17.857
I DIDN´T KNOW ABOUT IT
 TILL I WALKED OUT AND SAW IT.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.629
THEN WHY DID YOU SAY
 IT WAS YOURS?

14:19.629 --> 14:22.162
I JUST WENT WITH IT!

14:22.162 --> 14:23.433
YOU LIED TO ME AGAIN!

14:23.433 --> 14:24.995
ANGIE, THIS IS MY FAULT.

14:24.995 --> 14:27.297
GEORGE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT,
 AND HE FELT TERRIBLE.

14:27.297 --> 14:28.899
NO, IT´S MINE.

14:28.899 --> 14:32.402
I SHOULD HAVE JUST TOLD YOU
 I DIDN´T DO IT.

14:32.402 --> 14:33.904
BUT I PANICKED.

14:33.904 --> 14:35.946
ANGIE, I CAN´T STAND
 YOU BEING MAD AT ME.

14:35.946 --> 14:40.010
I´M NOT MAD ANYMORE.
 I´M MORE DISAPPOINTED.

14:40.010 --> 14:45.355
IN ALL OUR TIME TOGETHER,
 I NEVER LIED TO YOU -- NEVER!

14:51.061 --> 14:52.522
I´M SORRY, GEORGE.

14:52.522 --> 14:55.895
I DIDN´T KNOW MARISOL
 WAS COMING BACK.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.529
I TRIED TO PAINT IT MYSELF,
 BUT HALFWAY THROUGH

14:59.529 --> 15:03.033
IT STARTED LOOKING
 LIKE A MONKEY WITH BOOBS.

15:03.033 --> 15:06.937
I KNOW ONE MONKEY WITH BOOBS
 THAT OWES ME SOME MONEY.

15:06.937 --> 15:10.280
WELL, GET IT FROM MARIAH CAREY,
 ´CAUSE THAT´S WHO YOU PAINTED!

15:14.114 --> 15:16.316
WHAT AM I GONNA DO, MAN?

15:16.316 --> 15:20.350
NOW ANGIE´S GONNA THINK
 EVERYTHING I TELL HER IS A LIE.
 SHE´LL GET OVER IT.

15:20.350 --> 15:23.023
SHE´S NEVER GONNA TRUST ME --
 NEVER.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.394
I WOULDN´T SAY, "NEVER,"

15:24.394 --> 15:27.057
AND SHE SHOULDN´T SAY
 "NEVER" EITHER.

15:27.057 --> 15:28.358
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:28.358 --> 15:31.301
WELL, I DIDN´T WANT
 TO TELL YOU THIS,

15:31.301 --> 15:33.333
´CAUSE I REALLY LOVE ANGIE,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.365
BUT...SHE LIED TO YOU, MAN.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.207
SHE TOLD YOU A BIG LIE.

15:37.207 --> 15:41.071
ONE OF THE KIDS ISN´T MINE?

15:41.071 --> 15:43.013
IS IT CARMEN?

15:43.013 --> 15:46.176
NO. NO. REMEMBER
 THE SADIE HAWKINS DANCE --

15:46.176 --> 15:47.717
YOUR FIRST DATE WITH ANGIE?

15:47.717 --> 15:51.081
THERE WAS A REASON
 WE WERE BOTH ASKED OUT.

15:53.984 --> 15:56.486
GEORGE!

15:56.486 --> 15:59.429
[ LAUGHS ]
 I GOT A "D" IN CHEMISTRY!

15:59.429 --> 16:01.631
[ LAUGHS ]
 WHAT´D YOU GET?

16:01.631 --> 16:03.693
DUDE, WHO CARES
 WHAT I GET IN CHEMISTRY?

16:03.693 --> 16:06.136
WHEN WE LEARN
 HOW TO PLAY INSTRUMENTS

16:06.136 --> 16:07.397
AND WRITE MUSIC AND SING

16:07.397 --> 16:09.239
AND OUR BAND SABOTAGE
 TAKES OFF,

16:09.239 --> 16:10.340
WE´RE OUTTA HERE.

16:10.340 --> 16:13.043
SHEE-OW! SHEE-OW!

16:13.043 --> 16:14.344
[ LAUGHS ]

16:14.344 --> 16:17.107
GEORGE, GEORGE,
 WE´RE BEING WATCHED.

16:19.149 --> 16:21.111
WE´RE BEING CHECKED OUT.

16:21.111 --> 16:23.983
HEY, HEY, THEY´RE COMING OVER.
 WHAT DO WE DO?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.556
BE COOL. TAKE YOUR HAND
 OUT OF MY BELT LOOP.

16:28.658 --> 16:32.692
HEY, THERE. UM...
 THIS IS CARLA, AND I´M ANGIE.

16:32.692 --> 16:36.996
I KNOW.
 I SEE YOU AT THE GAMES CHEERING.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.430
I LOVE YOUR WORK.

16:41.731 --> 16:45.375
SO, ARE YOU GUYS GOING
 TO THE SADIE HAWKINS DANCE?

16:45.375 --> 16:46.736
DANCES SUCK.

16:46.736 --> 16:49.639
THEN, UM, YOU WOULDN´T WANT
 TO GO WITH US?

16:49.639 --> 16:53.012
DID I SAY, "SUCK"?
 I MEANT "ROCK"!

16:54.644 --> 16:58.017
WELL, OKAY, THEN.
 IT´S A DATE.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.549
SO, DO I GET TO BE WITH YOU?

16:59.549 --> 17:01.721
HEY, HEY,
 LET THE LADIES DECIDE.

17:06.695 --> 17:09.159
I´LL TAKE THIS ONE,
 YOU TAKE THAT ONE.

17:09.159 --> 17:10.400
[ LAUGHS ]

17:10.400 --> 17:11.601
I´M THAT ONE.

17:11.601 --> 17:13.103
OKAY, THEN.

17:13.103 --> 17:16.566
WE´LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE
 THE DANCE AT 7:30.

17:19.739 --> 17:23.213
OH, MY GOD,
 THEY´RE SO PATHETIC!

17:23.213 --> 17:25.075
I DON´T KNOW IF I CAN GO
 THROUGH WITH THIS.

17:25.075 --> 17:26.415
EVERYBODY´S GONNA SEE ME
 WITH HIM.

17:26.415 --> 17:28.718
YOU WANT TO BE
 THE ONLY CHEERLEADERS

17:28.718 --> 17:30.780
WHO DON´T SHOW UP
 WITH LOSERS?

17:30.780 --> 17:32.282
NO.

17:32.282 --> 17:35.155
WITH THESE TWO,
 WE´VE GOT A CHANCE TO WIN.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.286
TOTALLY!

17:36.286 --> 17:38.228
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

17:43.563 --> 17:45.165
HOW´D YOU FIND ALL THIS OUT?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.237
CARLA TOLD ME.
 SHE FELT GUILTY.

17:47.237 --> 17:49.669
SHE SAID I WAS PROBABLY
 A HUMAN BEING

17:49.669 --> 17:52.102
AND DESERVED
 TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE.

17:52.102 --> 17:54.244
SO, HOW COME
 YOU NEVER TOLD ME?

17:54.244 --> 17:56.246
WELL, I DIDN´T WANT
 TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

17:56.246 --> 17:58.378
BESIDES, YOU AND ANGIE
 FELL IN LOVE.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.409
IT WORKED OUT GREAT.

17:59.409 --> 18:01.111
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

18:01.111 --> 18:05.385
I UNDERMINED THE VERY FOUNDATION
 OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.857
NO! SHE LIED FIRST!

18:11.691 --> 18:13.163
WHAT YOU DOIN´?

18:13.163 --> 18:16.266
I´M IN A CHAT ROOM
 COMPLAINING ABOUT MEN.

18:16.266 --> 18:19.729
Lesbiantownhall.com.

18:19.729 --> 18:22.172
IS ANYBODY DEFENDING ME?

18:22.172 --> 18:25.835
YES. THE 13-YEAR-OLD BOY
 PRETENDING TO BE A LESBIAN

18:25.835 --> 18:27.307
THINKS YOU´RE COOL.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.180
EVERYBODY ELSE
 SUGGESTS COUNSELING.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.812
YOU KNOW WHAT?
 THAT´S A GOOD IDEA.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.285
REALLY?
 YEAH.

18:35.285 --> 18:38.117
I MEAN, WHEN YOUR RELATIONSHIP
 STARTS OUT WITH A LIE,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.420
IT MAKES YOU QUESTION
 EVERYTHING AFTERWARDS.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.192
IT SURE DOES.

18:42.192 --> 18:45.155
THE PERSON
 WHO LIED FIRST --

18:45.155 --> 18:49.729
OH, MAN, HOW CAN THEY EVER
 COME BACK FROM THAT?

18:49.729 --> 18:51.801
I DON´T KNOW, GEORGE.

18:51.801 --> 18:54.904
HEY, WHY DON´T YOU SEE
 IF YOU CAN FIND A COUNSELOR

18:54.904 --> 18:57.307
WHO SPECIALIZES
 IN NASTY CHEERLEADERS

18:57.307 --> 19:00.310
WHO MAKE BETS ABOUT GOING
 TO DANCES WITH LOSERS?!

19:03.443 --> 19:04.674
WHAT?

19:04.674 --> 19:06.716
I KNOW!!

19:08.318 --> 19:11.321
CARLA TOLD ERNIE
 AND ERNIE TOLD ME

19:11.321 --> 19:14.454
AND DOING THIS HURTS MY VOICE,
 BUT I KNOW!

19:14.454 --> 19:18.558
OH, GEORGE, IT WAS 18 YEARS AGO,
 AND I WAS A TEENAGER --

19:18.558 --> 19:20.190
A STUPID CHEERLEADER.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.392
I DIDN´T KNOW
 WHAT I WAS DOING.

19:22.392 --> 19:24.634
SO I WAS JUST
 A BIG JOKE TO YOU?
 NO.

19:24.634 --> 19:26.536
ARE YOU DENYING
 I WAS A LOSER?

19:26.536 --> 19:31.741
NO.

19:31.741 --> 19:34.704
WELL, I WOULDN´T BE
 SO HIGH AND MIGHTY.

19:34.704 --> 19:36.546
YOU LIED TO ME, TOO -- TWICE.

19:36.546 --> 19:38.748
MY LIE
 WAS BECAUSE I WANTED YOU.

19:38.748 --> 19:41.411
YOUR LIE WAS TO COVER UP
 YOUR EVILNESS.

19:41.411 --> 19:43.683
EVILNESS?
 IF I HADN´T DONE THAT,

19:43.683 --> 19:46.816
WE WOULD HAVE NEVER GOT TOGETHER
 IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:46.816 --> 19:49.719
IF I HADN´T DONE WHAT I DID,
 WE WOULDN´T HAVE EITHER.

19:49.719 --> 19:52.422
SO OUR LOVE IS BUILT ON LIES.

19:52.422 --> 19:53.963
YES, IT IS!

19:55.895 --> 20:00.570
OUR LOVE IS BUILT
 ON WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL LIES.

20:00.570 --> 20:01.801
I´M PROUD OF THOSE LIES.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.574
THOSE LIES HAVE LED
 TO A GREAT MARRIAGE,

20:04.574 --> 20:06.936
TWO BEAUTIFUL KIDS,
 AND THIS KILLER CRIB!

20:09.279 --> 20:11.581
COME ON, ANGIE.

20:11.581 --> 20:14.514
I TELL YOU ONE THING

20:14.514 --> 20:17.547
I NEVER LIED ABOUT --

20:17.547 --> 20:19.589
I LOVE YOU.

20:19.589 --> 20:23.393
AND I LOVE YOU, TOO.

20:27.457 --> 20:30.760
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
 MISTER.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.803
NOW THAT YOU´VE LOST
 YOUR MURAL,

20:33.803 --> 20:38.237
YOU ARE SO ON THE HOOK
 FOR VALENTINE´S DAY,

20:38.237 --> 20:40.610
MY BIRTHDAY, MOTHER´S DAY,

20:40.610 --> 20:43.443
AND OUR ANNIVERSARY.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.916
YOU GOT IT, BABY.

20:46.916 --> 20:49.879
JUST TELL ME
 WHEN THOSE THINGS ARE.
