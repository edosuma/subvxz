Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:05.794 --> 00:06.959
I still can't believe

00:06.961 --> 00:09.129
they're actually
charging us for water.

00:09.131 --> 00:10.097
Why not?

00:10.099 --> 00:11.330
Well 'cause this is Ireland.

00:11.332 --> 00:12.833
I mean I'm not a
scientist or anything,

00:12.835 --> 00:15.469
but as far as I
know in this country

00:15.471 --> 00:18.104
that stuff falls
freely from the sky.

00:18.106 --> 00:20.139
Just so you know, I might
have to go to sleep really soon

00:20.141 --> 00:21.508
if you know what I mean.

00:21.510 --> 00:25.479
Yeah, oh yeah, right,
yeah, sorry, of course.

00:35.658 --> 00:38.824
I mean I wouldn't mind
if we lived in the desert

00:38.826 --> 00:42.495
or on the moon or
somewhere like that,

00:42.497 --> 00:43.964
but I mean the
next thing we know,

00:43.966 --> 00:45.866
you know, they'll be
charging us for using air.

00:45.868 --> 00:46.833
You know what.

00:46.835 --> 00:48.367
I'm really not in the mood.

00:59.882 --> 01:02.418
You know tomorrow is my
mother's nine-month anniversary.

01:03.618 --> 01:05.752
Oh, I'm so glad
I got to meet her.

01:05.754 --> 01:07.754
Yeah, me too.

01:07.756 --> 01:10.523
I just wish she'd had time
to get to know you better.

01:10.525 --> 01:13.225
Yeah, I never did get beyond
calling her Mrs. McCarthy.

01:13.227 --> 01:15.662
No, she let you call
her Mary at the end.

01:15.664 --> 01:16.930
Yeah, maybe once,

01:16.932 --> 01:19.365
but even then it was a
little uncomfortable.

01:28.576 --> 01:30.877
Well I'm sure she's
looking down on us now.

01:30.879 --> 01:33.015
Yeah, I'm sure she is.

01:36.852 --> 01:38.885
Well life goes on.

01:38.887 --> 01:40.787
Honey, no, no.

01:40.789 --> 01:42.288
Not in front of your mother.

01:52.700 --> 01:53.966
No, no, honey.

01:53.968 --> 01:55.470
Sorry, it's that
time of the week.

01:56.537 --> 01:58.004
That time of the week?

01:58.006 --> 01:58.840
Yeah.

01:59.808 --> 02:02.074
Are American women different?

02:02.076 --> 02:05.178
No, it's Wednesday,
I work a double tomorrow.

02:05.180 --> 02:06.947
Oh right, that
time of the week.

02:06.949 --> 02:09.918
Oh, okay good, phew, goodnight.

02:10.519 --> 02:11.587
Goodnight.

02:24.199 --> 02:27.199
I am so over waiting tables.

02:27.201 --> 02:29.136
Well hopefully it won't
be for too much longer.

02:29.138 --> 02:30.904
No, just leave it, it's fine.

02:30.906 --> 02:32.905
No, actually, I think
I need to hang that up.

02:32.907 --> 02:37.209
It's fine, there,
it's up.

02:37.211 --> 02:39.512
Don't you have
gravity in America?

02:39.514 --> 02:42.083
No, no, I never heard of it.

02:43.419 --> 02:46.953
I need to hang that up.

03:06.207 --> 03:07.340
Hi.

03:07.342 --> 03:10.109
Hey, I have the closing shift

03:10.111 --> 03:13.679
so I will try not to wake
you up when I come in.

03:13.681 --> 03:14.614
No, don't
worry if you do.

03:14.616 --> 03:16.048
I always fall back to sleep.

03:16.050 --> 03:19.251
I mean as long as you remember
to hang up your clothes

03:19.253 --> 03:21.687
and don't leave them
lying on the floor.

03:21.689 --> 03:24.723
You know what, maybe
I'll sleep in the other room.

03:24.725 --> 03:26.459
What, what do you mean?

03:26.461 --> 03:27.960
Well we'll talk
about this later, okay?

03:27.962 --> 03:29.095
I gotta go.

03:29.097 --> 03:30.763
- Talk about what later?
- I have to go.

03:30.765 --> 03:32.465
Look, Nicole, I know
things haven't been great

03:32.467 --> 03:34.201
between us the last few
months, but they'll get better.

03:34.203 --> 03:36.502
I mean we're just settling
into married life.

03:36.504 --> 03:38.370
You know all couples.

03:38.372 --> 03:40.874
You know this is supposed
to go in recycling.

03:40.876 --> 03:44.077
And what's this doing in here?

03:44.079 --> 03:44.913
Really?

03:45.781 --> 03:47.012
Oh my God.

03:47.014 --> 03:49.215
No, no, look, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

03:49.217 --> 03:51.150
Just, you'll feel better,
I promise you will.

03:51.152 --> 03:53.586
Look just just give
it a couple of days,

03:53.588 --> 03:55.856
or a couple of weeks,
or a few months.

03:55.858 --> 03:56.692
I'm late.

04:39.855 --> 04:41.186
Have a
good weekend Colm.

04:41.188 --> 04:45.861
I will, cheers,
see you Monday.

04:47.529 --> 04:50.229
Oi, O'Sullivan, where
do you think you're going?

04:50.231 --> 04:52.332
- It's a minute to five.
- Exactly.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.999
Sure anything I started now,

04:54.001 --> 04:56.335
I could never get finished
in a single minute.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.736
I'd only be wasting my time.

04:57.738 --> 04:59.506
It's my time, not yours.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.510
Now back to work or don't
bother coming in Monday.

05:10.085 --> 05:12.085
I know he's not
the best boss in the world,

05:12.087 --> 05:13.419
but you can't just
steal all his money.

05:13.421 --> 05:15.321
If anyone deserves
it, it's him.

05:15.323 --> 05:17.222
I mean he's already
cut my wages twice

05:17.224 --> 05:18.558
in the last six months.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.460
How can he get away with that?

05:20.462 --> 05:22.227
He says it's because
of the recession,

05:22.229 --> 05:24.664
but sure he's hardly
even been affected by it.

05:24.666 --> 05:27.900
Yeah, well if you get caught,
you'll end up gonna jail,

05:27.902 --> 05:30.236
and that might be just as
bad as working for McSweeny.

05:30.238 --> 05:31.804
You know there
must be close to

05:31.806 --> 05:34.273
over 100,000 euro in there.

05:34.275 --> 05:35.474
How do you know that?

05:35.476 --> 05:37.710
I set up a nanny
cam inside his office.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.845
Really?

05:38.847 --> 05:41.683
- Yeah, so are you in or not?
- Not.

05:42.750 --> 05:46.453
- Why?
- Because we're not criminals.

05:46.455 --> 05:49.989
I mean we'd probably, you know,
try to blow open the safe,

05:49.991 --> 05:51.657
and end up setting
all the money on fire.

05:51.659 --> 05:52.958
You know there's
another reason

05:52.960 --> 05:54.794
why I set up the nanny cam.

05:54.796 --> 05:57.597
Is it because there's
a baby inside the safe?

05:57.599 --> 06:00.099
No, I actually
set up the nanny cam

06:00.101 --> 06:03.135
so that I could video tape
the exact combination he dials

06:03.137 --> 06:04.306
when he opens the safe.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.474
That's actually
not a bad idea.

06:07.476 --> 06:09.909
It's a stroke of genius.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.143
So are you in or out?

06:11.145 --> 06:13.314
I'm out, and it's your shout.

06:14.750 --> 06:18.083
Well, you're gonna regret
it, but try not to let it.

06:18.085 --> 06:19.518
Sorry to let you down,

06:19.520 --> 06:21.186
but I have more than
half a brain in my crown.

06:21.188 --> 06:22.354
I'm gonna have a ball

06:22.356 --> 06:24.058
and I won't be taking a fall.

06:25.726 --> 06:26.762
Oh, sorry about that.

06:29.363 --> 06:30.832
That's the stroke
of genius all right.

06:34.736 --> 06:36.268
Well, if I hadn't left America,

06:36.270 --> 06:38.237
then I could never have met
you when you came over here.

06:38.239 --> 06:40.172
So you really
didn't like living there?

06:40.174 --> 06:41.974
No, it's
just after 10 years,

06:41.976 --> 06:43.475
I was ready to come home.

06:43.477 --> 06:45.378
And anyway, I thought you
liked living in Ireland.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.380
I do, it's just
that I don't really feel

06:47.382 --> 06:49.616
like we're doing anything
with our lives here.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.116
I mean remember the
business idea we had?

06:51.118 --> 06:53.186
The sliding table
or the talking fridge?

06:53.188 --> 06:54.987
The talking fridge.

06:54.989 --> 06:56.856
Nobody wants to
have a talking fridge.

06:56.858 --> 06:58.290
How can you be so sure?

06:58.292 --> 07:00.626
Well 'cause I sell
appliances for a living.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.296
Nobody wants to, you know,
open their fridge door

07:03.298 --> 07:04.696
and have a voice telling
them what they should

07:04.698 --> 07:05.931
or shouldn't be eating.

07:05.933 --> 07:06.765
You know we
could've at least tried

07:06.767 --> 07:08.034
to get a prototype made.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.035
Where would
we have got the money

07:09.037 --> 07:10.270
to prototype a fridge?

07:10.272 --> 07:12.005
It's not
an entire fridge.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.873
It's just like a little device
that goes on the handle.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.008
Still it
would've been expensive.

07:15.010 --> 07:17.012
We could've got creative.

07:18.246 --> 07:19.979
Why do we always have

07:19.981 --> 07:22.080
to pay the electricity
bill right on time?

07:22.082 --> 07:24.083
Well, 'cause that's what
you're supposed to do.

07:24.085 --> 07:26.451
And anyway if you
don't, they cut you off.

07:26.453 --> 07:27.986
Not right away.

07:27.988 --> 07:29.756
I mean if we did everything
that we were supposed to do,

07:29.758 --> 07:32.661
then I would've gone back to
America even after I met you.

07:34.529 --> 07:37.830
Well I can't help it
if I'm so compelling.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.068
Or at least was so compelling.

07:40.936 --> 07:42.167
You know,

07:42.169 --> 07:43.469
I really should finish
my Master's degree.

07:43.471 --> 07:45.003
Well you can do that here.

07:45.005 --> 07:48.040
I mean, you know, UCC has a
whole nutrition department.

07:48.042 --> 07:50.777
And once your permanent
residency comes through,

07:50.779 --> 07:51.945
it'll be really cheap.

07:51.947 --> 07:53.179
It's not just that.

07:53.181 --> 07:58.053
I mean if my
visa wasn't expiring,

07:58.919 --> 08:00.753
would you have even proposed?

08:00.755 --> 08:03.692
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of
course I would have.

08:04.592 --> 08:05.724
Definitely.

08:05.726 --> 08:07.027
I should really go back.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.399
- To America?
- Yeah.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.534
By yourself?

08:15.436 --> 08:16.270
Yeah.

08:23.678 --> 08:25.078
You know, I don't need

08:25.080 --> 08:27.580
to always pay the
electricity bill on time.

08:27.582 --> 08:29.748
I mean, I don't need
to pay it at all.

08:29.750 --> 08:33.385
I mean 'cause I know you think
I'm this really kind of safe

08:33.386 --> 08:37.489
and boring kind of
person, but you know,

08:37.491 --> 08:39.025
I haven't told you this yet,

08:39.027 --> 08:42.159
but you know Colm's boss has
been ripping off his workers

08:42.162 --> 08:44.763
for a really long time,
and so myself and Colm,

08:44.765 --> 08:47.267
we're planning to
break in there and,

08:47.269 --> 08:49.369
and steal all the
money from the safe

08:49.371 --> 08:51.503
that he hasn't been
declaring to the tax office,

08:51.505 --> 08:54.306
so if you think that
I'm the kind of person

08:54.308 --> 08:55.842
that would never do
something like that,

08:55.844 --> 08:58.543
then obviously you
don't know the real me.

08:58.545 --> 09:00.613
How long have you
been planning this?

09:00.615 --> 09:02.248
A really long time.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.749
I mean at least at least I have.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.250
I mean Colm, I
mean he was saying,

09:05.252 --> 09:07.253
oh it's too dangerous, you
know, it's really risky,

09:07.255 --> 09:10.690
and I was saying what's life
without a little bit of risk.

09:10.692 --> 09:12.859
You know a little
bit of adventure.

09:12.861 --> 09:15.295
And then I said, you
know the only thing

09:15.297 --> 09:16.763
that I want from it is

09:16.765 --> 09:20.266
just enough money to be
able to build the prototype

09:20.268 --> 09:21.734
for the talking fridge.

09:21.736 --> 09:23.902
I thought you didn't like
the talking fridge idea.

09:23.904 --> 09:25.672
I was just pretending

09:25.674 --> 09:29.075
'cause then it would be an
even better surprise for you,

09:29.077 --> 09:31.643
you know when I got the
money to make the prototype.

09:31.645 --> 09:33.879
So the the workers get
the money they deserve,

09:33.881 --> 09:35.748
and we have enough
to build a prototype

09:35.750 --> 09:37.282
and market our product.

09:37.284 --> 09:39.087
Yeah, yeah exactly.

09:41.489 --> 09:42.989
What, what's that?

09:42.991 --> 09:45.590
Oh that's just my tax
bill, you know for my car.

09:45.592 --> 09:48.594
They want me to pay it
in the next two days.

09:48.596 --> 09:50.095
Like they have any hope

09:50.097 --> 09:52.098
of someone like me ever
doing something like that.

09:52.100 --> 09:55.801
Wow, I've never seen you
this passionate before.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.402
Yeah, well you'd
better get used to it

09:57.404 --> 09:59.772
'cause now that I know it
doesn't completely freak you out,

09:59.774 --> 10:01.775
I can just be my true
self for a change.

10:03.845 --> 10:06.713
And then I'm just gonna
destroy the water bill.

10:06.715 --> 10:08.815
Really, how you gonna do that?

10:08.817 --> 10:11.350
I'm gonna slash it
into a million pieces

10:11.352 --> 10:12.719
with a razor blade.

10:12.721 --> 10:13.920
And what about the rent check?

10:13.922 --> 10:15.922
- Oh, I have to send that.
- Oh.

10:15.924 --> 10:19.392
But, but, but, I'm gonna
send it five days late.

10:19.394 --> 10:20.792
And what about our clothes?

10:20.794 --> 10:22.228
Are we gonna hang them up?

10:22.230 --> 10:23.997
No, no, no, we're just
gonna throw them on the floor

10:23.999 --> 10:26.699
and pile them all the
way up to the ceiling.

10:26.701 --> 10:27.933
Oh, all the way
to the ceiling.

10:27.935 --> 10:28.702
And
through the roof.

10:30.972 --> 10:33.672
No, no, you did
not have to tell her.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.974
Yeah, I did.

10:34.976 --> 10:36.209
You know there are plenty

10:36.211 --> 10:37.609
of other ways you
can get her to stay.

10:37.611 --> 10:38.945
Yeah, like what?

10:38.947 --> 10:41.814
I don't know, just set
her passport on fire.

10:41.816 --> 10:43.316
Yeah, yeah,

10:43.318 --> 10:44.783
'cause she's never gonna
get another one of those.

10:44.785 --> 10:47.420
Or I could just hit you
over the head with a crowbar,

10:47.422 --> 10:49.088
tell the guards that she did it,

10:49.090 --> 10:50.422
then she'll get sent to prison,

10:50.424 --> 10:52.024
and you can go visit
her any time you like.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.826
You know, Colm, I really
wish I had your brains.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.029
Actually if you did hit me with
a crowbar, I probably would.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.632
I have the superior brains

10:59.634 --> 11:02.402
and my ideas come as
plentiful as the rains.

11:02.404 --> 11:05.537
Yeah, and you should be
locked up with the insanes.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.505
That's not a word.

11:06.507 --> 11:07.340
Yeah, it is.

11:07.342 --> 11:08.608
No, it's not.

11:08.610 --> 11:10.209
Look Colm, she has
to be involved, okay?

11:10.211 --> 11:11.244
I mean ever since I told her,

11:11.246 --> 11:12.644
it's like we're newlyweds.

11:12.646 --> 11:14.479
Ye are newlyweds.

11:14.481 --> 11:15.915
Yeah, well I'd
like it to continue

11:15.917 --> 11:17.950
to the next level if I could.

11:17.952 --> 11:21.287
We can handle it just fine
with just the two of us.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.221
Look, even if that was true,

11:23.223 --> 11:25.090
I'm not doing it unless
she's involved, okay?

11:25.092 --> 11:26.859
You can take it or leave it.

11:26.861 --> 11:29.128
Are you sure you don't want
me to hit you with a crowbar?

11:29.130 --> 11:30.595
Hm.

11:30.597 --> 11:32.165
Hey, hey, that's my boat.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.200
Get out, get out, get out.

11:34.202 --> 11:36.636
I thought you said we had
permission to use the boat.

11:36.638 --> 11:38.037
Hey, get
out that's my boat.

11:38.039 --> 11:38.970
- Of course we don't, row.
- That's my boat.

11:38.972 --> 11:40.440
Get out, get out, get out.

11:40.442 --> 11:41.373
You're gonna get me
killed one of these days.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.343
- Just row.
- God Almighty.

11:44.545 --> 11:46.912
So if we study this carefully,

11:46.914 --> 11:49.816
we definitely should be able
to work out the combinations.

11:51.653 --> 11:52.918
What's he doing here?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.287
He thinks he
can come round any time

11:55.289 --> 11:56.556
there's a match on the telly.

11:56.558 --> 11:58.025
- Should I let him in?
- No.

11:59.794 --> 12:00.627
Hey guys.

12:03.030 --> 12:03.863
Oh, no need to get up.

12:03.865 --> 12:04.698
I'm already here.

12:08.837 --> 12:10.335
- What are ye watching?
- Nothing.

12:10.337 --> 12:11.771
Yes ye are, what
are ye watching?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.272
It doesn't matter.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.540
If it doesn't matter then
why are ye watching it?

12:14.542 --> 12:15.874
It has nothing to
do with you, okay?

12:15.876 --> 12:17.176
Then who's it to do with?

12:17.178 --> 12:18.244
Just mind your own
business, all right.

12:18.246 --> 12:19.746
Look, can we watch the match.

12:30.558 --> 12:33.392
I can see that the extended
warranty may be worth it

12:33.394 --> 12:37.196
over time, but in my case
there may not be a whole lot

12:37.198 --> 12:39.831
of time left if you
know what I mean.

12:39.833 --> 12:41.801
Yeah, I see your
point, all right.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.636
What?

12:43.837 --> 12:45.470
Well no, I mean
I was just saying,

12:45.472 --> 12:48.007
yeah, it's wise
to consider that.

12:48.009 --> 12:50.609
I mean I don't know what year
you were born, but you might...

12:50.611 --> 12:53.979
It is absolutely
no business of yours

12:53.981 --> 12:55.480
what year I was born.

12:55.482 --> 12:58.350
I'm sorry, Ma'am, I was
just agreeing with you.

12:58.352 --> 12:59.951
I mean you were the one
that said that you...

12:59.953 --> 13:04.456
I'm aware of what I
said, thank you very much.

13:04.458 --> 13:07.460
The cheek of a little
whippersnapper like you...

13:07.462 --> 13:08.628
- Shane
- Implying that I'm past

13:08.630 --> 13:10.396
- my sell by date.
- What are you doing?

13:10.398 --> 13:12.330
Why wouldn't you tell me about
the video ye were watching?

13:12.332 --> 13:13.699
Where did you get that anyway?

13:13.701 --> 13:14.933
I took it from Colm's house.

13:14.935 --> 13:16.502
I knew ye were trying
to hide something.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.204
Can you sign me
out for a five-minute break?

13:18.206 --> 13:19.672
There's no need.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.974
Just do it, okay.

13:21.976 --> 13:23.676
You don't want to be
involved in this, okay?

13:23.678 --> 13:25.811
- Why?
- Because it's too risky.

13:25.813 --> 13:27.279
You're gonna steal the money
from the safe, aren't ye?

13:27.281 --> 13:29.548
Will you keep your
voice down for God's sake.

13:29.550 --> 13:31.484
I want to be
part of it as well.

13:31.486 --> 13:34.052
Look, it's not my
decision to make, okay.

13:34.054 --> 13:36.354
Why are the two of ye always
doing things without me?

13:36.356 --> 13:38.157
Ye never let me be
a part of anything.

13:38.159 --> 13:39.425
You can be part of
other things, okay?

13:39.427 --> 13:40.960
Just not this.

13:40.962 --> 13:42.595
All right then, fine.

13:42.597 --> 13:44.596
If that's the way
you want to be,

13:44.598 --> 13:47.633
but um now that I know about it,

13:47.635 --> 13:49.601
it's not gonna be my fault
if something slips out

13:49.603 --> 13:51.070
when I'm talking to other people

13:51.072 --> 13:52.772
because it's very hard for
me to control what I'm saying

13:52.774 --> 13:54.739
about things about
fellas who I know...

13:54.741 --> 13:55.809
Whippersnapper.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.682
So it's just the
four of us now, right?

14:03.684 --> 14:04.617
Right.

14:04.619 --> 14:05.951
And are ye sure about that?

14:05.953 --> 14:07.619
Well my cousin
might be interested.

14:07.621 --> 14:08.888
Should I ask him?

14:08.890 --> 14:10.755
No, we don't want to
ask your cousin Shane.

14:10.757 --> 14:12.657
What about my sister?

14:12.659 --> 14:14.560
We don't want
any of your family.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.698
Let's just keep it
amongst ourselves, okay?

14:21.435 --> 14:22.236
So...

14:28.275 --> 14:30.875
So the first thing McSweeny
does in the video is go

14:30.877 --> 14:33.579
about 20 minutes clockwise,

14:33.581 --> 14:38.417
then 35 minutes anti-clockwise

14:38.419 --> 14:41.921
about 18 minutes clockwise,

14:41.923 --> 14:44.824
28 minutes anticlockwise

14:44.826 --> 14:48.494
and then 13 minutes
clockwise again.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.796
And you can see the
numbers on the video?

14:50.798 --> 14:54.300
No, but as long as we
know the starting point

14:54.302 --> 14:57.369
and follow exactly the same
pattern as McSweeny does,

14:57.371 --> 14:59.971
then we should open the safe
up without any problems.

14:59.973 --> 15:01.941
It's not that simple.

15:01.943 --> 15:02.774
Why not?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.009
Well first of all,

15:04.011 --> 15:06.412
the face of a clock
has only 60 positions,

15:06.414 --> 15:08.714
where a dial on a safe
probably has about a hundred,

15:08.716 --> 15:11.716
and when you're considering
you can't see exactly

15:11.718 --> 15:13.185
what numbers he turns to,

15:13.187 --> 15:16.321
you're gonna have to allow
for a margin of error.

15:16.323 --> 15:21.194
Shane if you break my
tree house, I will kill you.

15:23.597 --> 15:25.096
What kind of a margin?

15:25.098 --> 15:26.766
Well you're gonna have to
consider that it could be,

15:26.768 --> 15:29.502
you know, plus or minus one
at every stop of the dial.

15:29.504 --> 15:31.369
And how many possibilities
does that make?

15:31.371 --> 15:33.505
There's um five positions.

15:33.507 --> 15:37.710
Three possibilities each, that's
three to the power of five.

15:37.712 --> 15:40.713
- 15, 15.
- That's not so bad.

15:40.715 --> 15:43.849
No, actually it's more
like a couple of hundred.

15:43.851 --> 15:45.486
When was the video last taken?

15:46.754 --> 15:48.287
About two weeks ago.

15:48.289 --> 15:50.089
And has he opened
the safe since then?

15:50.091 --> 15:51.259
Yeah, probably.

15:52.693 --> 15:54.960
So he probably spins the
dial after he closes it,

15:54.962 --> 15:57.495
so the starting positions
are gonna be different

15:57.497 --> 16:01.200
than what's on the video, so
your plan's kind of hopeless.

16:01.202 --> 16:02.634
It is not hopeless.

16:02.636 --> 16:04.737
Okay, look, if you can
get back in the office,

16:04.739 --> 16:07.340
and you can see what
number the safe is on now,

16:07.342 --> 16:09.943
and then you videotape it
the next time he opens it,

16:11.145 --> 16:12.947
I think we can find
a definite pattern.

16:21.588 --> 16:23.888
Colm, you need to see what
number the dial is on now

16:23.890 --> 16:24.956
and then set up the
nanny cam again.

16:24.958 --> 16:26.492
I could do that, yeah.

16:26.494 --> 16:28.494
And we should write
all the possible combinations

16:28.496 --> 16:30.562
on poster board so we can
see them all together.

16:30.564 --> 16:32.731
Yeah, and I can get
some poster board from work.

16:32.733 --> 16:33.898
And I can get
some of the other supplies

16:33.900 --> 16:35.401
from the restaurant.

16:35.403 --> 16:37.570
Oh and you know the clock face
was good for demonstration,

16:37.572 --> 16:39.138
but for practicing we're
gonna need something

16:39.140 --> 16:40.739
that has a hundred
increments instead.

16:56.757 --> 17:00.792
Could you tell how many minutes
that one has in its hour.

17:00.794 --> 17:02.394
60.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.262
I'm just gonna
steal these and take them home.

17:04.265 --> 17:05.262
Really?

17:05.265 --> 17:07.700
Yeah, yeah, I'm just gonna,

17:07.702 --> 17:10.237
well no, actually, I should
probably leave 10 euro.

17:11.371 --> 17:12.604
They don't
cost that much.

17:12.606 --> 17:13.873
Yeah, well
I just want to make sure

17:13.875 --> 17:16.608
I'm covered, you know,
so the boss just.

17:16.611 --> 17:19.810
I'm looking for one that a
hundred minutes in the hour.

17:19.813 --> 17:21.079
Do you have any of those?

17:21.082 --> 17:22.748
No.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.118
See you tomorrow.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.796
There you go,
Sister, enjoy that now.

17:37.798 --> 17:40.666
May the Lord have
mercy on your soul

17:40.668 --> 17:44.338
and all those who come
into contact with it.

17:48.775 --> 17:51.611
And that last
one looks like 65.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.983
I think this is really
gonna work, guys.

17:57.985 --> 17:59.417
You and I can write
down the combinations

17:59.419 --> 18:00.985
- on the poster board.
- Yeah.

18:00.987 --> 18:02.353
And you can test
the equipment.

18:02.355 --> 18:03.621
Yeah.

18:03.623 --> 18:05.124
Once we write
down three possibilities

18:05.126 --> 18:07.091
for each of the five digits
and then do every combination

18:07.093 --> 18:09.093
of all those numbers
in the correct order,

18:09.095 --> 18:11.362
we should come up
with 243 combinations.

18:32.453 --> 18:34.887
All right, so tomorrow we can
cross check the combinations

18:34.889 --> 18:36.254
on the poster board
against each other,

18:36.256 --> 18:38.756
and as long as
everything adds up,

18:38.758 --> 18:41.060
I think I can have it typed
and ready by Friday night.

18:41.062 --> 18:42.962
- This Friday night?
- Yeah.

18:42.964 --> 18:45.164
Maybe we should
wait another week.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.698
- Another week?
- Yeah.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.632
Why?

18:47.634 --> 18:49.167
I mean, you know,

18:49.169 --> 18:51.971
we've been having such a good
time planning everything,

18:51.973 --> 18:53.772
maybe we should
just continue to be,

18:53.774 --> 18:56.242
you know, planning everything.

18:56.244 --> 18:59.344
You're funny.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.747
Yeah, I am.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.682
Colm says he can easily
get us into the front door,

19:03.684 --> 19:05.184
and according to him,

19:05.186 --> 19:07.453
the only security camera is
right there at that entrance,

19:07.455 --> 19:11.490
so if we park here at
other side of the building,

19:11.492 --> 19:14.359
we just have to cover our
faces until we get inside.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.361
So we're gonna need
some kind of disguises.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.397
Okay, well if you're
going to be typing up

19:18.399 --> 19:19.665
the combinations tomorrow,

19:19.667 --> 19:21.567
I suppose I could
probably go get us

19:21.569 --> 19:23.234
some disguises if you like.

19:23.236 --> 19:24.104
Great.

19:39.687 --> 19:42.790
- Hm, grand day, isn't it?
- 'Tis, yeah.

19:44.124 --> 19:45.925
So you're shopping
for the wife, are you?

19:45.927 --> 19:46.761
I am, yeah.

19:48.129 --> 19:49.661
Tell me something.

19:49.663 --> 19:52.097
Is she a very big woman or
is she a very small woman?

19:52.099 --> 19:53.365
That's not important.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.367
Oh but it is, it's
extremely important.

19:55.369 --> 19:57.836
Well then, she's a thin woman.

19:57.838 --> 19:59.871
Look, I just want to buy these.

19:59.873 --> 20:01.473
Absolutely not.

20:01.475 --> 20:02.942
What?

20:02.944 --> 20:05.677
You take my advice now and
put these two back on the shelf

20:05.679 --> 20:07.913
if you don't want to get
into the height of trouble

20:07.915 --> 20:09.180
when you get home.

20:09.182 --> 20:10.081
What do you mean?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.384
What do I mean, says he.

20:12.386 --> 20:14.820
Sure aren't these two
the very largest size

20:14.822 --> 20:16.288
that's available to womanhood.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.924
Well to be honest, I'm
not really sure of her size,

20:18.926 --> 20:21.593
I, so I just need to
take the small ones

20:21.595 --> 20:23.963
and the extra large
ones just in case.

20:23.965 --> 20:26.999
But haven't you already told
me she's a very thin woman?

20:27.001 --> 20:32.006
Yes, I have but, well,
they're not for her, okay.

20:33.173 --> 20:36.609
I mean the small ones
are, but the large ones,

20:36.611 --> 20:38.711
they're for someone
else entirely.

20:38.713 --> 20:41.446
I see how it is now all right.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.916
Well there's no doubt about it,

20:43.918 --> 20:47.418
but the sacrament of marriage
isn't worth a single freckle

20:47.420 --> 20:48.853
of what it used to be.

20:48.855 --> 20:50.622
No, no, it's not
like that at all.

20:50.624 --> 20:54.092
When it comes to men
and their fancy women,

20:54.094 --> 20:57.362
there's not one single
morsel of a moral left

20:57.364 --> 21:00.331
inside any of their
godforsaken adulterous heads.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.333
Look, even if that was true,

21:02.335 --> 21:04.302
it's none of your
business, okay?

21:04.304 --> 21:06.237
I just came in here
to buy something,

21:06.239 --> 21:08.573
so, so let me buy it
and I'll be on my way.

21:08.575 --> 21:10.274
Hello Jim.

21:10.276 --> 21:11.709
Yeah.

21:11.711 --> 21:13.012
If you feel like
dropping round to the shop

21:13.014 --> 21:15.313
in the next couple of minutes,

21:15.315 --> 21:17.715
you never know what
you might find.

21:17.717 --> 21:18.650
What's going on?

21:18.652 --> 21:19.885
I can guarantee you

21:19.887 --> 21:22.620
that even if it doesn't
happen straightaway,

21:22.622 --> 21:25.023
any married man who engages

21:25.025 --> 21:28.994
in such vulgar
adulterous activities

21:28.996 --> 21:32.296
will most definitely get
his comeuppance in the end.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.694
You called the guards?

22:02.228 --> 22:04.128
If I can get something
on this fella now,

22:04.130 --> 22:04.963
we can knock off for
the rest of the day.

22:04.965 --> 22:06.932
Jim, don't move.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.099
There's a fella behind you

22:08.101 --> 22:09.001
who has a gun
pointed at your head.

22:09.003 --> 22:10.037
What?

22:11.037 --> 22:13.171
I got you a beauty.

22:13.173 --> 22:14.740
Who's the bastard now, hah?

22:14.742 --> 22:16.007
Oh you are.

22:16.009 --> 22:17.810
You're definitely the bastard.

22:17.812 --> 22:21.148
And now I get to go
home for the rest of the day.

22:26.454 --> 22:29.321
- How's it going there?
- How's it going?

22:32.226 --> 22:34.294
Are you aware that your
tax disc has expired?

22:35.662 --> 22:39.231
I, yeah, well it's
just by a couple of days,

22:39.233 --> 22:41.397
and you know to be honest,

22:41.399 --> 22:41.667
that's the first
time in my whole life

22:41.669 --> 22:43.003
that I didn't renew it.

22:44.938 --> 22:47.171
It doesn't matter if
it's a couple of days

22:47.173 --> 22:49.943
or a couple of minutes, you
still have to pay the fine.

22:51.411 --> 22:54.582
Wow, nothing like this has
ever happened to me before.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.484
You know I couldn't
help noticing

22:59.486 --> 23:03.224
that your friend played a
bit of a joke on you before.

23:04.291 --> 23:06.023
Oh begod, he did.

23:06.025 --> 23:08.159
And I can't believe
I fell for it.

23:08.161 --> 23:09.962
Well I don't know if
you'd be interested,

23:09.964 --> 23:12.865
but maybe I could help you try

23:12.867 --> 23:14.699
to play a joke on him, you know.

23:14.701 --> 23:17.401
And then if he falls for it,
you see, you got him back

23:17.403 --> 23:18.870
and I could keep
my driving record

23:18.872 --> 23:20.738
as clean as it's always been.

23:20.740 --> 23:23.007
He's probably gone
home to the house.

23:23.009 --> 23:25.409
I tell you what, why
don't we hop into your car

23:25.411 --> 23:26.611
and drive over there.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.147
And when we get there,
you blow the horn,

23:28.149 --> 23:29.348
and as soon as Kieran comes out,

23:29.350 --> 23:31.082
you throw me out
onto the ground,

23:31.084 --> 23:32.451
I'll go face-down on the dirt,

23:32.453 --> 23:33.985
and he'll think I'm
completely dead on the ground.

23:33.987 --> 23:35.454
No, no, no, I
was just thinking

23:35.456 --> 23:37.356
that maybe I could do
something like, you know,

23:37.358 --> 23:39.358
I could ring him up
and pretend, you know,

23:39.360 --> 23:41.092
you hurt your big
toe or something

23:41.094 --> 23:44.362
and I'm the doctor asking
him to come pick you up.

23:44.364 --> 23:46.430
And then and he'd
drive all the way

23:46.432 --> 23:49.201
to the hospital and I
wouldn't even be there?

23:49.203 --> 23:50.337
Yeah, exactly.

23:51.538 --> 23:53.504
No, no, let's go
with the other one.

23:53.506 --> 23:55.476
Hop in there and we'll
drive around to the house.

23:57.044 --> 23:59.343
No, no, listen, I'm sorry.

23:59.345 --> 24:01.013
I don't know why I said that.

24:01.015 --> 24:03.381
You know it's just been
a really strange week,

24:03.383 --> 24:05.082
and I haven't
really been myself,

24:05.084 --> 24:10.022
so why don't you give me a fine
for the tax disc, and and...

24:10.024 --> 24:11.255
- Hey.
- We'll call it a day.

24:11.257 --> 24:12.456
You know now, I
have plenty of ways

24:12.458 --> 24:14.326
of finding a lot
more wrong with a car

24:14.328 --> 24:16.195
besides an expired tax disc.

24:16.197 --> 24:17.931
You can be absolutely
sure of that.

24:23.303 --> 24:24.802
That's a nice house.

24:24.804 --> 24:27.240
- And the both of ye live here?
- Uh huh.

24:31.144 --> 24:35.615
Now you blow the horn, and
then boot me out of the car.

24:36.816 --> 24:39.219
What do you mean boot
you out of the car?

24:41.788 --> 24:46.090
Lift up your leg, and then
kick me as hard as you can

24:46.092 --> 24:48.161
and send me flying
out onto the ground.

24:49.330 --> 24:51.897
No, no, listen,
I can you know,

24:51.899 --> 24:54.832
maybe I can blow the horn,
but if you want to do that,

24:54.834 --> 24:57.502
then I think you should
probably make your own way

24:57.504 --> 24:58.839
out of the car.

25:12.052 --> 25:15.155
Jim, Jim, Jimmy,
are you all right?

25:16.189 --> 25:17.755
Jim, are you all right, boy?

25:19.392 --> 25:23.962
I got you
an absolute beauty, hah?

25:23.964 --> 25:25.397
You scared the
living daylights out of me.

25:25.399 --> 25:27.299
And you thought I was
completely dead on the ground,

25:27.301 --> 25:28.500
didn't you?

25:28.502 --> 25:29.434
Oh begod, I did.

25:29.436 --> 25:30.936
So who's the bastard now, hah?

25:30.938 --> 25:34.438
Oh you are, Jim, you're
definitely the bastard.

25:34.440 --> 25:35.775
And don't you forget it.

25:37.076 --> 25:38.644
And another thing.

25:38.646 --> 25:40.111
What?

25:40.113 --> 25:41.312
I don't think we'll
have any problem reaching

25:41.314 --> 25:43.115
our criminal quota
for the month.

25:43.117 --> 25:44.184
Is that right, Jim?

25:45.652 --> 25:47.785
Hm, he gave me a right good
whack on the side of the head.

25:47.787 --> 25:50.355
Oh I can see a
mark there all right.

25:50.357 --> 25:51.555
But you...

25:51.557 --> 25:53.591
You have the
right to remain silent.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.627
Anything you say
can and will be held

25:55.629 --> 25:58.496
against you in a court of law.

25:58.498 --> 26:01.300
But, he forced forced
my hand to I didn't...

26:01.302 --> 26:03.267
That sounds like an
admission of guilt to me.

26:03.269 --> 26:04.770
Absolutely, and I'm sure that

26:04.772 --> 26:08.042
that's how a judge
will see it as well.

26:29.196 --> 26:30.030
Here's how it is.

26:31.130 --> 26:33.598
First, Kieran got me

26:33.600 --> 26:36.167
by making me think that
you had a gun pointed

26:36.169 --> 26:38.136
to the back of my head.

26:38.138 --> 26:42.273
Then yourself and myself got
Kieran by making him think

26:42.275 --> 26:44.775
that I was stone
dead on the ground,

26:44.777 --> 26:47.579
and now the two of us got you

26:47.581 --> 26:49.747
by arresting you for
assaulting a guard.

26:49.749 --> 26:52.451
A good whack on
the side of the head.

26:52.453 --> 26:55.686
And we got you an absolute
beauty, didn't we, Kieran?

26:55.688 --> 26:57.188
Oh we did.

26:57.190 --> 26:59.491
I'd say that's probably
one of our best ever, is it?

26:59.493 --> 27:01.827
I'd say it's in
the top 20 anyway.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.462
Oh, top 15 surely.

27:03.464 --> 27:04.298
17.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.166
16.

27:07.900 --> 27:11.138
So I'm not really
under arrest?

27:13.873 --> 27:14.908
Oh God, no,

27:17.477 --> 27:19.813
what kind of fellas do
you think we are at all?

27:20.813 --> 27:21.915
I don't really know.

27:25.986 --> 27:27.185
Good luck to you now.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.954
All right,
thanks very much.

27:28.956 --> 27:30.955
It was a great laugh, lads.

27:30.957 --> 27:32.657
Thanks, thanks a
million, bye bye now.

27:32.659 --> 27:33.759
All the best to you now, boy.

27:33.761 --> 27:35.496
Yeah, all the best.

27:36.964 --> 27:40.167
God Almighty.

27:42.870 --> 27:46.170
And then after they handcuffed
me, and I started, you know,

27:46.172 --> 27:47.606
thinking about the possibility

27:47.608 --> 27:50.574
of spending half
my life in jail,

27:50.576 --> 27:54.847
I realized that I can't keep
up this kind of charade.

27:56.015 --> 27:57.782
You know, I mean
the last few days

27:57.784 --> 27:59.818
with you have just
been fantastic,

27:59.820 --> 28:04.825
but you know the truth is
that I've been living a lie,

28:06.025 --> 28:08.426
and no matter what
the consequences,

28:08.428 --> 28:11.495
now I feel that I just
have to tell you the truth.

28:11.497 --> 28:15.233
Okay, what are you What are
you trying to say exactly?

28:15.235 --> 28:19.170
Well I...

28:19.172 --> 28:21.307
I would, just
hold on one second.

28:26.412 --> 28:27.478
Hello.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.147
Are you the wife of a fella

28:29.149 --> 28:34.154
with a car that has a
number plate 99G2416?

28:36.023 --> 28:37.522
I'm sorry, who is this?

28:37.524 --> 28:39.291
Never mind who I am.

28:39.293 --> 28:42.461
Did you know that your
husband is having an affair

28:42.463 --> 28:43.962
with another woman?

28:43.964 --> 28:46.197
He's a good for nothing
philandering little scamp.

28:46.199 --> 28:47.131
Who is this?

28:47.133 --> 28:48.366
How did you get our number?

28:48.368 --> 28:50.169
I'm a woman the
same as yourself

28:51.572 --> 28:55.674
who once trusted a scoundrel
that ended up dragging my heart

28:55.676 --> 28:57.809
over the fiery coals.

28:57.811 --> 29:00.878
And if you have any respect
for yourself whatsoever,

29:00.880 --> 29:03.348
you won't let the same
thing happen to you.

29:14.995 --> 29:17.928
So you have
been living a lie.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.164
Yeah, I mean that

29:19.166 --> 29:20.098
that's what I've been
trying to tell you.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.032
And what about now.

29:21.034 --> 29:22.734
I mean is it still going on?

29:22.736 --> 29:25.236
No, no, it's not.

29:25.238 --> 29:26.437
I mean I know
we've had our issues,

29:26.439 --> 29:28.439
but I never thought you
were the kind of guy

29:28.441 --> 29:30.474
to just sleep with
another woman.

29:30.476 --> 29:34.111
What, I didn't sleep
with another woman.

29:34.113 --> 29:35.413
Really?

29:35.415 --> 29:36.648
Of course not.

29:36.650 --> 29:37.983
So then there was
nothing physical?

29:37.985 --> 29:39.050
Only with you.

29:39.052 --> 29:41.418
Oh, thank God.

29:41.420 --> 29:43.788
Oh, I mean I could hardly
blame you for wanting

29:43.790 --> 29:45.023
to connect with someone else,

29:45.025 --> 29:46.558
especially on an
emotional level,

29:46.560 --> 29:48.459
considering how distant I've
been these past few months,

29:48.461 --> 29:50.361
but I mean I feel

29:50.363 --> 29:53.365
like I've been really moving
past all that, you know.

29:53.367 --> 29:57.535
I mean especially now that
I know who you really are.

29:57.537 --> 30:01.174
And, you know, especially
since you were gonna,

30:02.376 --> 30:05.010
you were gonna tell
me the whole truth.

30:05.012 --> 30:08.780
From now on, you are not gonna
connect with anyone else.

30:08.782 --> 30:11.215
Not even on an
emotional level, right?

30:11.217 --> 30:13.484
- Right.
- Right?

30:13.486 --> 30:14.852
Yeah.

30:14.854 --> 30:16.588
Okay, so do you want

30:16.590 --> 30:21.595
to go over those little safe
combinations one more time?

30:22.629 --> 30:24.929
Yeah, yeah I do.

30:24.931 --> 30:26.430
Okay.

30:28.701 --> 30:29.935
So the only security camera is

30:29.937 --> 30:31.035
outside the front door, right?

30:31.037 --> 30:32.469
Yes.

30:32.471 --> 30:33.737
Okay, so we should
put on our disguises now

30:33.739 --> 30:35.005
and make sure not to
take them off until

30:35.007 --> 30:36.741
we're inside the front door.

30:36.743 --> 30:38.312
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

30:39.178 --> 30:40.678
This is it.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.714
Stay in the car,
do not move, do not get out,

30:42.716 --> 30:44.014
and only use the walkie talkie

30:44.016 --> 30:45.449
if you see someone coming, okay?

30:45.451 --> 30:50.457
Okay.

31:13.813 --> 31:15.179
Over there.

31:15.181 --> 31:16.281
Okay, let's
just go through the list

31:16.283 --> 31:17.749
until we get the right one.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.599
36.

31:39.139 --> 31:39.973
21.

31:41.608 --> 31:42.442
85.

31:43.643 --> 31:44.576
96.

31:44.578 --> 31:46.444
Hey, Good Buddy.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.880
Is something wrong?

31:51.017 --> 31:52.218
Is there someone coming?

31:54.454 --> 31:55.455
Do you hear me?

31:56.790 --> 31:58.423
Shane can you hear me?

31:58.425 --> 32:00.524
Are you over?

32:00.526 --> 32:02.226
No, we're not over.

32:02.228 --> 32:04.628
We'll be out when we are, okay?

32:04.630 --> 32:08.532
No, are you over
on the walkie talkie, over.

32:08.534 --> 32:12.072
Just tell me is everything
all right out there?

32:14.073 --> 32:14.874
Is every

32:16.842 --> 32:18.010
over.

32:19.412 --> 32:21.478
Well Good Buddy, Good
Buddy needs to tell Big Daddy

32:21.480 --> 32:23.281
what's going on
with Rubber Duckie,

32:23.283 --> 32:26.083
Slim Shaker, and
American Pie, over.

32:26.085 --> 32:29.553
Shane, just don't contact me

32:29.555 --> 32:30.388
unless somebody is around, okay?

32:30.390 --> 32:32.657
- 20, 85
- Over.

32:32.659 --> 32:37.195
Is that an over, or
an over and out, over.

32:37.197 --> 32:39.964
That's an over and
if you don't shut up,

32:39.966 --> 32:42.032
I'll punch your lights out.

32:42.034 --> 32:43.301
10-4 Good Buddy.

32:43.303 --> 32:45.570
This an over and out
from Big Daddy, too.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.932
How's it looking?

33:13.934 --> 33:15.601
Well we're down
to the last two.

33:16.535 --> 33:17.702
Okay.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.870
All right.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.638
No.

33:21.640 --> 33:24.777
This is it.

33:27.447 --> 33:28.446
No.

33:28.448 --> 33:30.682
Oh my God.

33:30.684 --> 33:31.916
What?

33:31.918 --> 33:32.716
I didn't allow for
enough possibilities.

33:32.718 --> 33:34.218
I'm pretty sure that,

33:34.220 --> 33:36.020
oh if you have a margin of
error in the first position,

33:36.022 --> 33:38.555
and then it increases
in the next position,

33:38.557 --> 33:40.859
and then with every
position after that.

33:40.861 --> 33:42.560
I can't believe I
didn't remember that.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.263
It's the propagation of errors.

33:45.265 --> 33:47.298
God, there's not hundreds
of possibilities.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.703
There's thousands.

33:50.970 --> 33:51.804
Sky,

33:53.540 --> 33:54.374
car,

33:56.376 --> 33:57.210
car,

33:58.044 --> 33:59.044
car.

33:59.646 --> 34:00.147
Car, car!

34:02.015 --> 34:04.316
This is never gonna work.

34:05.785 --> 34:07.920
I'm sorry.

34:09.790 --> 34:13.724
There's a car and
and it's stopping over.

34:13.726 --> 34:14.859
- Where Shane?
- No hang on,

34:14.860 --> 34:16.460
I didn't say over.

34:16.463 --> 34:20.867
Well I did say over, but
it was over and not over.

34:22.034 --> 34:23.600
The next word I was
going to say was there,

34:23.601 --> 34:25.803
so it was stopping over there,
not over, which is over.

34:25.804 --> 34:28.339
Okay, Shane, okay.

34:28.341 --> 34:31.109
Just stay low and
be quiet, okay?

34:31.110 --> 34:32.811
Now turn off your walkie talkie,

34:32.813 --> 34:35.245
and stay out of
sight, over and out.

34:35.246 --> 34:37.080
Okay guys, come on.

34:37.081 --> 34:39.018
Shut the door,
turn off the light.

34:50.161 --> 34:52.597
Now, what can I get you?

34:52.599 --> 34:54.666
Did you remember to get
anything other than whisky?

34:54.668 --> 34:57.836
Oh sorry, I forgot.

34:57.838 --> 34:59.970
I suppose whisky
will have to do then.

34:59.972 --> 35:00.806
Right.

35:52.191 --> 35:53.658
There you go.

35:53.660 --> 35:54.494
Thanks.

35:59.398 --> 36:00.865
You're not having ice?

36:00.867 --> 36:04.104
Nah, I think I'll have
it straight tonight.

36:06.872 --> 36:08.872
And there I was
thinking you were a man

36:08.874 --> 36:10.408
that was set in his ways.

36:10.410 --> 36:12.512
Hm.

36:21.086 --> 36:22.588
- What's this?
- What's what?

36:23.622 --> 36:24.456
This.

36:27.293 --> 36:31.361
Ronan McSweeny, are
you cheating on me?

36:31.363 --> 36:33.463
Of course not, I'm
a man of principles.

36:33.465 --> 36:35.365
I wouldn't cheat on anyone.

36:35.367 --> 36:36.867
Really?

36:36.869 --> 36:40.673
Well except for my wife, but
that's completely different.

36:42.842 --> 36:44.675
So I'm the only woman
you ever brought here?

36:44.677 --> 36:46.311
Of course you are.

36:46.313 --> 36:50.983
Except for my wife, but that
was a really long time ago.

36:56.488 --> 36:58.622
You know what I think?

36:58.624 --> 37:00.091
What?

37:00.093 --> 37:04.428
I think you're cheating
on me with your wife.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.698
Ah for Heaven's sake.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.002
Would you have a bit of cop on.

37:10.336 --> 37:12.604
You know that nothing's
happened between me and my wife

37:12.606 --> 37:14.504
for well over a decade.

37:14.506 --> 37:16.941
Then why in God's name
do you refuse to leave her?

37:16.943 --> 37:17.908
I told you why.

37:17.910 --> 37:20.445
She owns over half the company,

37:20.447 --> 37:22.314
and the house is in
her name as well.

37:24.184 --> 37:25.416
I'd be left with
practically nothing.

37:25.418 --> 37:26.620
So it's
all about money?

37:31.992 --> 37:36.093
Ah Sarah, for God's
sake, have a bit of sense.

37:36.095 --> 37:38.298
What do you take me
for in God's name?

37:39.231 --> 37:40.367
I should've known.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.367
In all the years of being
your fool of a mistress,

37:43.369 --> 37:46.370
you've been messing around
with your wife behind my back.

37:46.372 --> 37:48.305
Ah for heaven's sake.

37:48.307 --> 37:49.573
Don't be so ridiculous.

37:49.575 --> 37:50.774
I would never think

37:50.776 --> 37:52.646
of any other woman
like that besides you.

37:53.512 --> 37:54.913
Especially my wife.

37:57.182 --> 37:58.983
What's going on, over.

38:34.354 --> 38:37.055
How could you
have not known about this?

38:37.057 --> 38:38.189
Me?

38:38.191 --> 38:40.490
Ye were the ones
putting it in the bags.

38:40.492 --> 38:41.959
Yeah, but you're the one

38:41.961 --> 38:43.428
who's been monitoring the
safe for the last two months.

38:43.430 --> 38:46.129
The nanny cam only films
the front of the safe.

38:46.131 --> 38:49.101
All the Irish punts
must've been in the back.

38:50.302 --> 38:51.836
And how long
has the Irish pound been

38:51.838 --> 38:54.071
- out of circulation?
- Since 2002.

38:54.073 --> 38:56.073
So obviously he's
been stacking it away

38:56.075 --> 38:58.075
a lot longer than we thought.

38:58.077 --> 38:59.776
Too many bubbles.
Too many bubbles.

38:59.778 --> 39:01.044
And they're
just not good anymore?

39:01.046 --> 39:01.947
No, they're not.

39:03.148 --> 39:04.881
Well I mean at least
we have some in euro.

39:04.883 --> 39:08.019
I mean it's probably
like 20,000.

39:08.021 --> 39:09.486
Hm, that's not too bad.

39:09.488 --> 39:14.191
But there must be three times
that amount in Irish pounds.

39:14.193 --> 39:17.394
I just don't understand why he
didn't change them into euros

39:17.396 --> 39:18.629
when he had the chance.

39:18.631 --> 39:20.263
Well maybe changing
over a large sum of cash

39:20.265 --> 39:22.200
over a short period of time
would've been a red flag

39:22.202 --> 39:23.533
to the tax department.

39:23.535 --> 39:26.236
The central bank,
it's our only option.

39:26.238 --> 39:27.771
How
is that an option?

39:27.773 --> 39:32.075
They still exchange
Irish pounds, they have to.

39:32.077 --> 39:33.878
Look, even even if they do,

39:33.880 --> 39:35.613
we can't just wander
in there with wads

39:35.615 --> 39:37.414
of outdated cash in our hands.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.615
Why not?

39:38.617 --> 39:40.117
Well because what
are we supposed to say?

39:40.119 --> 39:41.619
Oh oh you know this morning
I was changing the sheets

39:41.621 --> 39:43.687
on my bed, and 60,000
quid just happened

39:43.689 --> 39:46.023
to fall out from
under my mattress.

39:46.025 --> 39:48.725
We can do it in stages.

39:48.727 --> 39:50.363
Use the hairdryer.

39:52.097 --> 39:54.631
Sure, people are always
finding stacks of money

39:54.633 --> 39:58.236
in pockets of old coats
and things like that.

39:58.238 --> 40:01.571
If we do it 50 quid at a time,
it won't look suspicious.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.774
Right, so we're supposed to
go in there every single week

40:03.776 --> 40:06.778
for the next what, 20
or 30 years and say,

40:06.780 --> 40:09.012
oh well this particular
50 quid I happened to find

40:09.014 --> 40:11.349
in an old overcoat
that's different

40:11.351 --> 40:13.651
from all the other
thousands of overcoats

40:13.653 --> 40:15.486
that I've been finding
money in for the last,

40:15.488 --> 40:18.155
you know three or four decades.

40:18.157 --> 40:20.490
Yeah, nothing
suspicious about that.

40:20.492 --> 40:22.093
Yeah, and isn't the
central bank in Dublin?

40:22.095 --> 40:23.561
Yeah, it is.

40:23.563 --> 40:25.930
So if you factor in the
five or six hour drive

40:25.932 --> 40:29.466
it would take to get there and
back, and expenses like fuel,

40:29.468 --> 40:32.769
and wear and tear on the
car, and maybe a meal,

40:32.771 --> 40:34.137
you're gonna be
running at a loss.

40:34.139 --> 40:36.274
So what are we supposed to do?

40:36.276 --> 40:37.809
It's still money.

40:37.811 --> 40:39.343
It's still worth something.

40:39.345 --> 40:40.178
No, it's not.

40:40.180 --> 40:41.745
Not in this situation.

40:41.747 --> 40:43.180
And you know, we
can't leave it here.

40:43.182 --> 40:44.881
McSweeny might've already
reported it stolen.

40:44.883 --> 40:46.450
No, he wouldn't have.

40:46.452 --> 40:48.352
Not unless he wants the
revenue commissioner

40:48.354 --> 40:49.854
down on his head.

40:54.126 --> 40:56.459
You know what,
Brendan's right.

40:56.461 --> 40:58.428
We have to get rid of it.

40:58.430 --> 41:00.463
You know, we'll just
give it to some charity.

41:00.465 --> 41:02.399
No one's gonna suspect them.

41:02.401 --> 41:04.635
If they can find a way
to change it into euro,

41:04.637 --> 41:06.269
at least we know it
went to a good cause.

41:06.271 --> 41:09.439
But that's us,
we're the good cause.

41:09.441 --> 41:11.575
Look, we don't have
to decide now, okay?

41:11.577 --> 41:14.044
Why don't we just put
the money somewhere,

41:14.046 --> 41:15.278
we'll get some sleep,

41:15.280 --> 41:17.983
and we'll just work out
what to do later on.

41:20.285 --> 41:22.222
Okay.

41:23.389 --> 41:24.888
Do you still
think that our share

41:24.890 --> 41:27.457
of the euro will be enough
to build the talking fridge?

41:27.459 --> 41:29.593
Well it's not as
much as we expected,

41:29.595 --> 41:31.729
but I'm sure we
could at least build

41:31.731 --> 41:33.396
some kind of a prototype.

41:33.398 --> 41:35.332
If that's what you
still want to do.

41:35.334 --> 41:39.937
Yeah, we're
building a prototype.

41:39.939 --> 41:43.676
Yeah, we're
building a prototype.

41:55.755 --> 41:57.421
- Brendan, Brendan, wake up.
- What?

41:57.423 --> 41:58.923
Something happened
to the money.

41:58.925 --> 42:00.191
What, what happened?

42:00.193 --> 42:01.258
One of the bags is missing.

42:01.260 --> 42:03.461
It's the one with all the euro.

42:03.463 --> 42:05.062
Well who would've taken it?

42:23.715 --> 42:24.948
Shane
here, leave a message

42:24.950 --> 42:26.584
and I'll phone you back there.

42:26.586 --> 42:27.651
Shane, it's Brendan.

42:27.653 --> 42:28.686
We're on our way to your house,

42:28.688 --> 42:30.921
so just wait for us there, okay,

42:30.923 --> 42:33.291
and if you're not there,
just phone me back.

42:33.293 --> 42:34.892
Don't do anything stupid, okay.

42:34.894 --> 42:37.561
There you go,
Sister, enjoy that now.

42:47.006 --> 42:52.011
That's him,
that's him, there he is.

43:02.755 --> 43:05.323
Ye said it was dangerous
keeping it inside,

43:05.325 --> 43:06.724
and then I heard
ye say ye wanted

43:06.726 --> 43:08.526
to give it to charity,
so that's what I did.

43:08.528 --> 43:11.329
We were talking about
the pounds, not the euro.

43:11.331 --> 43:12.595
It wasn't euro.

43:12.597 --> 43:14.365
I looked inside, and
I saw it was pounds.

43:14.367 --> 43:17.734
Well then you must've
only looked at the very top.

43:17.736 --> 43:19.236
How do you, how
do you know that?

43:19.238 --> 43:20.771
Well, because look,
Shane, what happened was,

43:20.773 --> 43:23.606
okay we put the 20,000
euro in the blue bag,

43:23.608 --> 43:26.109
then we filled up the
white bag with pounds,

43:26.111 --> 43:28.044
but then there were
some pounds left over,

43:28.046 --> 43:30.613
so we took those and we
put them in the blue bag

43:30.615 --> 43:32.884
on top of the euro, okay?

43:34.253 --> 43:37.023
Now for the last
time, where did you leave it?

43:43.997 --> 43:45.695
Are there even
any nuns left anymore?

43:45.697 --> 43:46.930
Yeah, but
there's not that many,

43:46.932 --> 43:49.233
so probably nobody's
even seen it yet.

43:49.235 --> 43:51.267
Aw, hopefully.

43:51.269 --> 43:52.769
You know if
there really is a God,

43:52.771 --> 43:55.071
we're gonna get to that
money before the nuns do.

44:04.650 --> 44:05.883
Blow the
horn, blow the horn.

44:05.885 --> 44:06.816
I don't
want to scare the dog.

44:06.818 --> 44:07.617
For 20,000 euro.

44:11.791 --> 44:13.524
Why are these streets so narrow?

44:13.526 --> 44:14.457
'Cause
they were built

44:14.459 --> 44:16.227
when people only had horses.

44:16.229 --> 44:17.028
Well they
should've waited

44:17.030 --> 44:18.495
till cars were invented

44:18.497 --> 44:19.729
Excuse me, ma'am.

44:19.731 --> 44:21.365
Excuse me, we're in
a bit of a hurry.

44:21.367 --> 44:23.733
- Would you mind just...
- You, again?

44:23.735 --> 44:26.505
- I'm, we're just, we gotta...
- You whippersnapper.

44:49.762 --> 44:52.095
Praise be to God.

44:52.097 --> 44:53.564
But is it enough
to save the school?

44:53.566 --> 44:55.166
Oh indeed it is, Ukaria.

44:55.168 --> 44:59.102
Indeed it is.

44:59.104 --> 45:01.305
Thanks be to God.

45:01.307 --> 45:03.743
Amen.

45:06.546 --> 45:08.778
Yeah but even if we
could break in there,

45:08.780 --> 45:11.381
the nuns probably have it
stashed away somewhere.

45:11.383 --> 45:13.084
We're never gonna find it.

45:13.086 --> 45:14.218
We have to
get it, it's our money.

45:14.220 --> 45:15.452
No, it's not.

45:15.454 --> 45:16.687
Well, it's not
the nuns' money.

45:16.689 --> 45:17.954
They didn't steal it.

45:17.956 --> 45:19.756
Oh, well then all we
have to do is go down

45:19.758 --> 45:21.658
to the courthouse
and tell the judge

45:21.660 --> 45:22.892
that we're the
ones that stole it.

45:22.894 --> 45:24.894
I'm not saying
it's ours legally.

45:24.896 --> 45:26.062
I'm saying morally.

45:26.064 --> 45:27.263
Yeah, and how do we even know

45:27.265 --> 45:29.066
the nuns haven't called
the police already?

45:29.068 --> 45:30.300
Because they need the money

45:30.302 --> 45:31.635
so their school
doesn't shut down.

45:31.637 --> 45:33.472
That's, that's why
I gave it to them.

45:34.439 --> 45:35.608
- Colm!
- Colm!

45:36.809 --> 45:38.075
He's probably right.

45:38.077 --> 45:40.144
I mean if they've been
asking for donations,

45:40.146 --> 45:41.711
why would they even question it?

45:41.713 --> 45:43.847
We'll go over to the
convent and tell the nuns

45:43.849 --> 45:46.082
that we're the
commissioner of schools

45:46.084 --> 45:48.619
and that we will leave their
school open indefinitely

45:48.621 --> 45:52.722
for 20,000 euros up
front, no questions asked.

45:52.724 --> 45:55.091
Yeah, or we could
just go in there

45:55.093 --> 45:57.160
and tell them we're
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,

45:57.162 --> 46:00.365
and we need 20,000 euro to
stop heaven from closing down.

46:03.668 --> 46:07.005
Well at least we tried.

46:22.255 --> 46:23.856
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

46:24.823 --> 46:26.323
How do you mean?

46:26.325 --> 46:29.026
Well it's been a
very exciting week,

46:29.028 --> 46:32.198
but maybe we're just
fooling ourselves.

46:33.599 --> 46:34.767
You think so?

46:35.934 --> 46:37.869
It certainly feels
that way.

46:41.541 --> 46:43.042
We'll dress up as guards.

46:44.010 --> 46:45.209
What?

46:45.211 --> 46:46.577
Myself and Colm, we'll
dress up as guards,

46:46.579 --> 46:48.445
and we'll go in there
and tell the nuns

46:48.447 --> 46:49.680
that the money is stolen

46:49.682 --> 46:51.916
and just demand that
they hand it over.

46:51.918 --> 46:53.850
You want to impersonate
a police officer?

46:53.852 --> 46:56.220
Yeah, yeah, that's
exactly what I want to do.

46:56.222 --> 46:57.590
I mean all I need is...

46:59.559 --> 47:02.325
Those two guards who
pretended to arrest me,

47:02.327 --> 47:04.061
if I can find a way
back into their house,

47:04.063 --> 47:06.129
I'll just steal their uniforms.

47:06.131 --> 47:07.064
Really?

47:07.066 --> 47:09.332
Yeah, yeah, I mean actually,

47:09.334 --> 47:11.068
I can find a way back
into their house.

47:11.070 --> 47:12.635
I remember after they
took the handcuffs off me,

47:12.637 --> 47:14.004
I went into the bathroom,

47:14.006 --> 47:16.273
and I was thinking if
they try anything else,

47:16.275 --> 47:17.908
I can just escape out
through the window

47:17.910 --> 47:19.209
'cause it wasn't even locked.

47:19.211 --> 47:20.711
And you think it
still might be open?

47:20.713 --> 47:22.713
Yeah, I mean lots of people
leave their bathroom window

47:22.715 --> 47:24.180
open all the time.

47:24.182 --> 47:25.615
Sneaking in there like that,
isn't that kind of risky?

47:25.617 --> 47:27.117
Of course it's risky.

47:27.119 --> 47:29.153
But what do I care about
a little thing like risk?

47:29.155 --> 47:31.055
I mean I'm not gonna let
something like that stop us

47:31.057 --> 47:32.957
from getting where
we need to be.

47:32.959 --> 47:34.591
I mean I'm just not
that kind of a person.

47:34.593 --> 47:36.292
We should go now?

47:36.294 --> 47:37.528
Now?

47:37.530 --> 47:38.461
I mean the guards
are probably sleeping,

47:38.463 --> 47:39.729
and at this time of night,

47:39.731 --> 47:41.599
we could be there and
back with the uniforms

47:41.601 --> 47:42.832
in less than an hour.

47:42.834 --> 47:45.135
Yeah, yeah, I mean
we probably could,

47:45.137 --> 47:47.671
but I mean the other
thing we could do is

47:47.673 --> 47:50.307
we could just stay here and,
you know, take advantage

47:50.309 --> 47:53.077
of these really exciting
feelings that we're having.

47:53.079 --> 47:55.613
No, no, no, this
is too exciting.

47:55.615 --> 47:56.680
Come on, get up.

47:56.682 --> 47:58.651
We are stealing garda uniforms.

48:00.952 --> 48:02.218
Yeah.

48:12.631 --> 48:14.298
Well even
if it's not open,

48:14.300 --> 48:15.499
we'll have to find
another way in.

48:15.501 --> 48:16.334
Yeah.

48:17.736 --> 48:19.269
And you're
sure they don't have guns?

48:19.271 --> 48:21.338
No, guards in
Ireland never carry guns.

48:21.340 --> 48:22.573
Well how
do they shoot people?

48:22.575 --> 48:25.341
- They don't.
- Well what do they do?

48:25.343 --> 48:27.244
I don't know,
they have truncheons.

48:27.246 --> 48:28.879
Oh, and
those have bullets?

48:28.881 --> 48:30.513
- No, of course not.
- Oh.

48:30.515 --> 48:31.649
But if
you got over the head

48:31.651 --> 48:32.816
with one of those things,

48:32.818 --> 48:33.883
it could really crack
open your skull.

48:33.885 --> 48:34.887
Oh, okay.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.756
Okay, so what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna go in there,

48:39.758 --> 48:41.358
I'm gonna grab the
uniforms and be back...

48:41.360 --> 48:42.792
No, no, no, no, I
should go in there.

48:42.794 --> 48:43.593
I'm gonna fit more easily
through the window.

48:43.595 --> 48:44.394
No, you're not.

48:44.396 --> 48:45.928
And anyway it's my idea,

48:45.930 --> 48:47.463
so I should be the
one who goes in there.

48:47.465 --> 48:48.999
Why wouldn't I fit more
easily through the window?

48:49.001 --> 48:50.834
Well because even though
I have broader shoulders,

48:50.836 --> 48:53.037
I can just pull them in, and
once I get past my chest,

48:53.039 --> 48:54.805
I don't have any hips
to worry about, so...

48:54.807 --> 48:55.707
And I do?

48:57.142 --> 49:00.244
No, no, no you don't,
I didn't mean that, I...

49:00.246 --> 49:03.546
Okay, fine, so the
uniforms are at the end

49:03.548 --> 49:04.881
of the kitchen table?

49:04.883 --> 49:06.350
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, well at least

49:06.352 --> 49:07.850
that's where they hung
them the day I was there,

49:07.852 --> 49:09.952
and I assume
they're still there.

49:09.954 --> 49:12.523
Actually I can just
make them out from here.

49:12.525 --> 49:13.957
They hung their hats
and their jackets.

49:13.959 --> 49:16.126
I think actually their
shirts are in there as well.

49:16.128 --> 49:18.662
I could grab them, and I
could be out in five seconds,

49:18.664 --> 49:20.698
I mean, and actually I
could even open that door

49:20.700 --> 49:22.765
from the inside and come
straight out this way.

49:22.767 --> 49:24.600
I...

49:24.602 --> 49:26.903
What, what are you doing?

49:26.905 --> 49:30.341
What, Nicole, come
back, come back.

49:30.343 --> 49:31.610
You locked the window?

49:34.347 --> 49:35.448
Kieran, is that you?

49:36.715 --> 49:37.549
What?

49:38.651 --> 49:40.953
- I said is that you?
- Course it is.

49:41.820 --> 49:42.854
Who else would it be.

49:45.057 --> 49:47.791
Okay, God, I know we
haven't communicated

49:47.793 --> 49:51.729
in a really long time, and
well it's mostly your fault.

49:51.731 --> 49:54.365
I mean in fairness,
you're very aloof.

49:54.367 --> 49:58.434
But if you do happen to exist,

49:58.436 --> 50:01.004
maybe you could
just first of all

50:01.006 --> 50:02.441
just get Nicole out of this

50:09.648 --> 50:12.883
and then maybe make
it so that she,

50:12.885 --> 50:15.354
she, you understand what I mean.

50:26.398 --> 50:27.898
I know you're single
and everything,

50:27.900 --> 50:29.966
and maybe it works for you,

50:29.968 --> 50:33.539
but I don't think it'd
be very good for me.

50:51.523 --> 50:52.756
No, no, no, no, go, go back.

51:15.247 --> 51:16.148
Sh, sh, sh.

51:46.611 --> 51:49.012
Have you got
butterflies in your belly?

51:49.014 --> 51:51.717
No, but your coat
is really smelly.

51:52.651 --> 51:54.119
You don't look very steady.

51:56.222 --> 51:59.555
Well I don't think
you're really ready.

51:59.557 --> 52:00.657
What do you want?

52:00.659 --> 52:02.792
- A mani/pedi?
- What's a mani/pedi?

52:02.794 --> 52:04.428
It's a manicure pedicure.

52:04.430 --> 52:06.296
Abbreviations don't count.

52:06.298 --> 52:07.497
Oh really?

52:07.499 --> 52:09.166
Yeah, sorry.

52:09.168 --> 52:11.135
- Oh, why not?
- They just don't.

52:12.438 --> 52:14.937
Right, should we do this?

52:14.939 --> 52:16.342
Yeah, let's do it.

52:17.910 --> 52:21.512
All right, good
luck Officer McCarthy.

52:21.514 --> 52:22.945
Thank you, Ma'am.

52:22.947 --> 52:24.247
Although I probably
shouldn't use my real name.

52:24.249 --> 52:25.416
Yeah, probably not.

52:26.885 --> 52:28.151
You're gonna do
most of the talking, right?

52:28.153 --> 52:29.852
Don't worry,
we'll be grand.

52:29.854 --> 52:31.287
Are you sure?

52:31.289 --> 52:34.423
Of course, sure
those nuns are easily fooled.

52:39.197 --> 52:40.229
Thank you
very much, sister.

52:40.231 --> 52:41.599
You're very welcome.

52:42.901 --> 52:45.604
So how can I be of assistance?

52:46.771 --> 52:49.305
Well Sister, we're
gathering information

52:49.307 --> 52:52.108
with regards to monies
that went missing

52:52.110 --> 52:53.545
over this past weekend.

52:54.579 --> 52:55.945
Monies?

52:55.947 --> 52:58.582
Well, yes monies.

52:58.584 --> 53:01.017
I mean it is money,

53:01.019 --> 53:04.687
but there happens to be two
different currencies involved,

53:04.689 --> 53:09.258
so it may be more
appropriate to say monies.

53:09.260 --> 53:11.562
The majority of it is in euro,

53:11.564 --> 53:15.666
but there happens to be some
Irish pounds in there as well.

53:15.668 --> 53:17.533
Irish pounds you say?

53:17.535 --> 53:18.801
I do, Sister, yes.

53:18.803 --> 53:21.704
And so we were wondering
if you might have come

53:21.706 --> 53:25.242
into contact with said
monies at any stage

53:25.244 --> 53:27.079
during the last weekend?

53:28.479 --> 53:29.713
Do you know something?

53:29.715 --> 53:32.448
You look very familiar to me.

53:32.450 --> 53:33.283
I do?

53:33.285 --> 53:34.486
Yes, you do.

53:35.720 --> 53:37.620
Well you've
probably seen me out

53:37.622 --> 53:41.191
and about you know,
on my, my beat.

53:41.193 --> 53:44.162
Hm, that's probably
it all right.

53:45.363 --> 53:47.698
As I was saying, Sister,

53:47.700 --> 53:49.633
we were wondering
if you may have come

53:49.635 --> 53:54.640
into contact with the
aforementioned monies in question?

53:56.008 --> 53:58.207
You'd wonder why would anyone
have Irish pounds on them

53:58.209 --> 53:59.675
in this day and age.

53:59.677 --> 54:03.113
I mean they'd be of hardly
any value at all, would they?

54:03.115 --> 54:07.651
No, they probably wouldn't,
but as for the 20,000 euro,

54:07.653 --> 54:09.988
now that would definitely
have a value of,

54:10.889 --> 54:14.793
well of 20,000 euro.

54:16.028 --> 54:18.263
You're probably right there.

54:20.064 --> 54:21.597
Are you absolutely sure

54:21.599 --> 54:24.901
that yourself and myself
haven't met somewhere before?

54:24.903 --> 54:26.836
Yes, Sister, I am.

54:26.838 --> 54:27.838
And where would you be from?

54:27.840 --> 54:29.972
I'm from here,
from, from Cork.

54:29.974 --> 54:33.443
You don't seem to have
a very strong Cork accent.

54:33.445 --> 54:34.977
Well, I used to live abroad,

54:34.979 --> 54:37.079
and you see my wife
is a foreigner.

54:37.081 --> 54:41.417
You know sometimes I tend
to pick up things, you know.

54:41.419 --> 54:42.919
Is that right?

54:42.921 --> 54:46.756
So, Sister, if
you have information

54:46.758 --> 54:49.760
that might help us
with our investigation,

54:49.762 --> 54:51.830
we would really
like you to tell us.

54:53.231 --> 54:56.101
You wouldn't be Mary
McCarthy's son, would you?

54:57.369 --> 55:00.104
No, Sister, no, no I wouldn't.

55:01.305 --> 55:02.506
Well then whose
son would you be?

55:02.508 --> 55:05.908
I'd be Mary,
Mary Murphy's son.

55:05.910 --> 55:08.544
See, she'd be my
mother, you see,

55:08.546 --> 55:12.015
and so then I'd be her son.

55:12.017 --> 55:14.483
Now it is believed to
have been dropped off

55:14.485 --> 55:16.919
on the steps of
this very convent

55:16.921 --> 55:19.655
by a five-foot brown-haired
man who happened

55:19.657 --> 55:22.459
to be driving a bicycle.

55:22.461 --> 55:24.894
You know Mary
McCarthy's son was married

55:24.896 --> 55:27.363
to a foreigner as well.

55:27.365 --> 55:28.298
Really?

55:28.300 --> 55:30.267
I think she was an American.

55:30.269 --> 55:31.734
I remember it clearly now.

55:31.736 --> 55:35.405
A few months before
Mary McCarthy died,

55:35.407 --> 55:37.506
I heard her son was
getting married,

55:37.508 --> 55:40.242
and I said I'll pop my
head into the church

55:40.244 --> 55:42.379
just for the ceremony.

55:42.381 --> 55:45.515
And it was only when the
bride was saying her vows

55:45.517 --> 55:48.617
that I realized
where she was from.

55:48.619 --> 55:51.954
My wife is definitely
not an American, so...

55:51.956 --> 55:53.557
- No.
- No, she...

55:53.559 --> 55:55.194
Do you know
something about me?

55:56.394 --> 55:59.361
I've been teaching in
the primary school here

55:59.363 --> 56:02.233
for the last 42 years.

56:03.367 --> 56:05.167
And when you've been
teaching young children

56:05.169 --> 56:08.104
of that age for
as long as I have,

56:08.106 --> 56:10.640
you develop an impeccable sense

56:10.642 --> 56:15.647
of when someone is being
genuine and when they're not.

56:19.918 --> 56:23.919
Now I mustn't be late
for mass, gentlemen.

56:23.921 --> 56:25.421
It's very important
for someone like me

56:25.423 --> 56:28.057
to set a good example to the
rest of the congregation.

56:28.059 --> 56:33.064
Just like your mother,
God rest her soul,

56:34.265 --> 56:36.235
believed she was setting
a good example for you.

56:39.070 --> 56:42.206
And you can rest
assured, gentlemen,

56:43.608 --> 56:48.246
that any and all information
I possess on the matter,

56:49.680 --> 56:54.218
I will divulge to Sergeant
O'Connell himself directly.

57:07.698 --> 57:10.166
The other Irish
pounds, we should,

57:10.168 --> 57:12.434
we should probably burn them.

57:12.436 --> 57:14.504
Brendan, if she's
called the police,

57:14.506 --> 57:16.539
they can be here in
like 10 seconds flat.

57:16.541 --> 57:18.207
Yeah, yeah, I know that,

57:18.209 --> 57:20.943
but Nicole you're not gonna
have to worry about that

57:20.945 --> 57:22.345
'cause I just
booked you a ticket.

57:22.347 --> 57:23.280
What?

57:23.282 --> 57:24.213
Yeah, and I used everything

57:24.215 --> 57:25.715
that was in our savings account,

57:25.717 --> 57:27.416
and it's a nonrefundable
ticket, so you have to go.

57:27.418 --> 57:30.452
Huh, no, I'm not
going anywhere.

57:30.454 --> 57:33.256
God, I can't believe we
didn't get rid of these.

57:33.258 --> 57:34.658
Look I tried to get
you on an earlier one,

57:34.660 --> 57:35.725
but the earliest
one I could get is

57:35.727 --> 57:37.227
at seven o'clock tomorrow night,

57:37.229 --> 57:39.528
so all you have to do is
just lay low for 24 hours,

57:39.530 --> 57:41.430
and then you'll be safely
on your way back to America.

57:41.432 --> 57:43.166
Brendan, we're in
this together, okay?

57:43.168 --> 57:46.068
I mean all we have to do is
just get rid of the evidence,

57:46.070 --> 57:47.470
and everything's gonna be fine.

57:47.472 --> 57:48.604
We're not.

57:48.606 --> 57:50.472
We're not in anything together.

57:50.474 --> 57:53.209
Look I know when we first
got married it seemed

57:53.211 --> 57:55.211
like I was a very
adventurous person,

57:55.213 --> 57:58.180
but that was because we
were falling in love.

57:58.182 --> 58:01.283
You know, that was the
adventure, and to be honest,

58:01.285 --> 58:04.389
I've, I've never wanted
anything more than that.

58:05.791 --> 58:07.624
And I know you wanted to
do the talking fridge idea,

58:07.626 --> 58:12.631
I mean we should've, and we
didn't because I was afraid.

58:14.832 --> 58:18.535
And that's who I am, and you
deserve better than that,

58:18.537 --> 58:23.542
so all you gotta do is just
lay low for the next 24 hours,

58:24.910 --> 58:27.112
get on that plane, and
just get on with your life.

58:35.753 --> 58:37.053
Brendan
Hugh McCarthy?

58:37.055 --> 58:38.588
Yeah.

58:38.590 --> 58:40.256
I'm Detective Clifford,
this is Detective Coleman.

58:40.258 --> 58:42.258
You're under arrest on
suspicion of robbery,

58:42.260 --> 58:44.093
suspicion of
impersonating a guard,

58:44.095 --> 58:46.863
and the illegal possession
of a Garda uniform.

58:46.865 --> 58:48.330
You have the right
to remain silent.

58:48.332 --> 58:50.767
Anything you say can and
will be held against you

58:50.769 --> 58:51.736
in a court of law.

58:53.438 --> 58:57.106
Wait, Where are
you taking him?

58:57.108 --> 58:59.277
He'll have a chance to
phone you when he gets there.

59:19.264 --> 59:22.666
Yeah, that's right,
we have him now.

59:22.668 --> 59:23.501
Yeah.

59:53.064 --> 59:58.070
Well begod, hah?

59:58.936 --> 01:00:00.169
We got you, didn't we, Kieran?

01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:02.771
Oh we did, we definitely did.

01:00:02.773 --> 01:00:04.274
And you hadn't a
clue in the world

01:00:04.276 --> 01:00:06.242
that it was the pair of us
that was behind it, did you?

01:00:06.244 --> 01:00:07.376
What's going on?

01:00:07.378 --> 01:00:09.111
I'll tell you exactly
what's going on.

01:00:09.113 --> 01:00:11.780
First Kieran got me
by making me think

01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:13.749
that you had a gun pointed
to the back of my head.

01:00:13.751 --> 01:00:14.585
Top 29.

01:00:16.088 --> 01:00:18.220
Then yourself
and myself got him

01:00:18.222 --> 01:00:20.622
by making him think that I
was stone dead on the ground.

01:00:20.624 --> 01:00:22.124
Top 26.

01:00:22.126 --> 01:00:25.428
Then myself and himself
got you by making you think

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:28.164
that you were after being
arrested for assaulting a guard.

01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.200
Top 17.

01:00:30.936 --> 01:00:35.939
And then you got us by
breaking into our house

01:00:35.941 --> 01:00:38.041
in the middle of the night.

01:00:38.043 --> 01:00:39.541
Top 32.

01:00:39.543 --> 01:00:42.512
And now we've got you
back even better than that

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.814
by sending the lads
around to arrest you

01:00:44.816 --> 01:00:46.950
for stealing the
pair of our uniforms.

01:00:46.952 --> 01:00:48.117
Top 14.

01:00:48.119 --> 01:00:49.551
So you knew about that?

01:00:49.553 --> 01:00:51.521
Sure of course we did.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:53.923
And you very nearly
got away with it, too.

01:00:53.925 --> 01:00:56.658
It was only that I was
climbing back into the bed

01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:59.195
and I heard a noise from
outside the front of the house,

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:01.330
and I got up and I looked out
the window, didn't I Kieran?

01:01:01.332 --> 01:01:02.599
Oh you did.

01:01:02.601 --> 01:01:04.633
Yeah, and when I saw
that it was your car

01:01:04.635 --> 01:01:06.269
that was driving away
into the distance,

01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:08.303
- do you know what I said?
- No.

01:01:08.305 --> 01:01:10.774
I said fair play
to that bastard.

01:01:10.776 --> 01:01:12.975
He got us an absolute beauty.

01:01:12.977 --> 01:01:14.376
And then do you
know what I said?

01:01:14.378 --> 01:01:15.912
No.

01:01:15.914 --> 01:01:17.780
I said we'll get him back an
even better beauty than that

01:01:17.782 --> 01:01:19.481
when we send the lads
around to arrest him

01:01:19.483 --> 01:01:21.316
and make him think he's
being taken off to the jail.

01:01:21.318 --> 01:01:22.619
Didn't I say that Kieran?

01:01:22.621 --> 01:01:24.019
Oh the very words,
Jim, the very words.

01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:26.189
So they said that
I was under suspicion

01:01:26.191 --> 01:01:27.689
of impersonating a guard

01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:30.292
'cause why else would
anyone steal Garda uniforms?

01:01:30.294 --> 01:01:33.729
But I was just getting ye back

01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:38.667
for the joke ye played on me
because I'm such a prankster.

01:01:38.669 --> 01:01:40.003
That's exactly it.

01:01:40.005 --> 01:01:43.405
So who's the bastard now, hah?

01:01:43.407 --> 01:01:45.742
Ye are, both of ye.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:49.579
You're definitely
a pair of bastards.

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:50.916
And don't you forget it.

01:02:25.094 --> 01:02:27.427
But I honestly thought that
we were gonna get arrested,

01:02:27.429 --> 01:02:29.998
so I was just saying
whatever I needed to say

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.500
to get you to go
safely back to America.

01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:34.835
So everything you said
this afternoon was a lie,

01:02:34.837 --> 01:02:36.570
but everything you told me

01:02:36.572 --> 01:02:38.306
before that this week
has been the truth?

01:02:38.308 --> 01:02:41.009
Well, no I mean, yes,

01:02:41.011 --> 01:02:44.145
I have been putting on
a kind of an act, but...

01:02:44.147 --> 01:02:46.346
I think I need to
use that plane ticket.

01:02:46.348 --> 01:02:47.614
What?

01:02:47.616 --> 01:02:50.050
I can be packed and
ready by tomorrow night.

01:02:50.052 --> 01:02:51.985
Nicole, we're not
going to get caught.

01:02:51.987 --> 01:02:53.520
I mean if the nun was
going to turn us in,

01:02:53.522 --> 01:02:54.788
she'd definitely
have done it by now.

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.491
I just wish I'd stuck
to my original decision,

01:02:56.493 --> 01:02:58.092
and then we wouldn't be locked

01:02:58.094 --> 01:02:59.893
into this nonrefundable ticket,

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:03.130
and we could've started
the divorce proceedings

01:03:03.132 --> 01:03:04.201
before I left.

01:03:05.268 --> 01:03:06.670
Divorce proceedings?

01:03:08.003 --> 01:03:10.471
But we've just had the
single greatest week

01:03:10.473 --> 01:03:11.706
of our married life.

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:13.241
And the entire time
you've been lying to me

01:03:13.243 --> 01:03:14.476
about who you really are.

01:03:45.342 --> 01:03:46.476
So,

01:03:48.177 --> 01:03:50.513
it's yourself again, is it?

01:03:51.413 --> 01:03:54.114
This is a fine state of affairs.

01:03:54.116 --> 01:03:57.219
A fine state of affairs indeed.

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:03.625
Was it you that dragged Mary
McCarthy's boy into this,

01:04:03.627 --> 01:04:05.726
or was it him that dragged you?

01:04:05.728 --> 01:04:07.494
It was me, Sister.

01:04:07.496 --> 01:04:09.063
It was all my idea.

01:04:09.065 --> 01:04:11.465
And was it just the two
of ye that stole the money,

01:04:11.467 --> 01:04:13.867
or was there someone
else involved as well?

01:04:13.869 --> 01:04:15.371
It was just the two of us.

01:04:17.973 --> 01:04:21.143
Do you know what I can't
stand more than anything else?

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.547
The devil?

01:04:25.681 --> 01:04:27.783
A bare-faced lie.

01:04:30.119 --> 01:04:34.087
Now you tell me exactly
who you were talking about

01:04:34.089 --> 01:04:36.757
when you were up here
dressed as a guard,

01:04:36.759 --> 01:04:38.525
and you told me the money
had been dropped off

01:04:38.527 --> 01:04:42.698
by a five-foot, brown-haired
fella driving a bicycle.

01:04:43.866 --> 01:04:45.132
Well, Sister,
it was just that...

01:04:45.134 --> 01:04:49.906
Tell me the truth, or
I swear by Almighty God,

01:04:50.773 --> 01:04:52.340
I'll be on to Sargent O'Connell,

01:04:52.342 --> 01:04:54.344
and it'll be straight into
jail with the pair of ye.

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.400
Yeah, what?

01:05:20.203 --> 01:05:21.036
What?

01:05:22.839 --> 01:05:25.806
What the hell are
you doing there?

01:05:25.808 --> 01:05:28.243
Yeah, I told you not.

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:32.380
Yeah, all right, okay.

01:05:32.382 --> 01:05:34.851
Yeah, look, okay, I'll be
there as soon as I can.

01:05:37.219 --> 01:05:38.888
And now the other fella.

01:05:46.628 --> 01:05:49.130
You need some help?

01:05:49.132 --> 01:05:52.335
Oh, um, no actually,
I'm almost done.

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:57.273
Yeah, actually, I sort of
need to get going anyway.

01:05:58.842 --> 01:06:01.175
Oh, you're going to work?

01:06:01.177 --> 01:06:04.080
I don't think I'm actually
gonna make it in there today.

01:06:05.447 --> 01:06:06.281
Right.

01:06:07.484 --> 01:06:10.550
I know your flight's
not till this evening,

01:06:10.552 --> 01:06:14.087
but there's a really good chance

01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:17.493
that I might not get to see
you again before you go.

01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:21.962
So this is goodbye?

01:06:21.964 --> 01:06:24.431
At least it's been an
interesting week.

01:06:24.433 --> 01:06:26.099
It has.

01:06:26.101 --> 01:06:27.034
The divorce papers,

01:06:27.036 --> 01:06:29.637
I'll, I'll organize those

01:06:29.639 --> 01:06:33.440
and, you know, probably I'll
just have to just send them

01:06:33.442 --> 01:06:35.308
over to you and you'll
probably just have to sign them

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:38.712
and just send them back, so
you're not gonna have to,

01:06:38.714 --> 01:06:41.349
- you know, worry about that.
- Thanks.

01:06:41.351 --> 01:06:43.083
And when your permanent
residency comes through,

01:06:43.085 --> 01:06:44.985
I'll just you know,

01:06:44.987 --> 01:06:46.987
just tell them you
don't need them anymore.

01:06:46.989 --> 01:06:51.994
And, that'll, um
yeah, so you can just,

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:54.130
you can just, you know,
forget about that.

01:06:55.264 --> 01:06:56.065
Okay.

01:06:57.534 --> 01:07:00.737
Well, have a good flight.

01:07:01.971 --> 01:07:03.273
Thanks, I will.

01:07:20.489 --> 01:07:21.991
Why would I bring my wife.

01:07:22.891 --> 01:07:24.527
Who said anything about my wife?

01:07:31.067 --> 01:07:34.070
We have to know the rules.

01:07:35.904 --> 01:07:37.473
In other words the?

01:07:40.243 --> 01:07:41.610
Commandments.

01:07:42.478 --> 01:07:43.980
Stretch up to the heavens.

01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:46.880
And how does that feel?

01:07:46.882 --> 01:07:48.416
Good, Sister, yeah.

01:07:48.418 --> 01:07:49.916
What commandment comes

01:07:49.918 --> 01:07:52.321
after thou shalt
not commit adultery?

01:07:53.522 --> 01:07:54.356
Brendan?

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:57.525
Um.

01:07:57.527 --> 01:07:59.195
Back of the class.

01:08:00.330 --> 01:08:01.762
Thou shalt not steal.

01:08:01.764 --> 01:08:03.598
Good boy, that's right.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.398
Now come up here and
sit in the front row.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.638
Now stretch down to
the depths of hell.

01:08:09.772 --> 01:08:11.137
And how does that feel?

01:08:11.139 --> 01:08:12.739
Not good sister.

01:08:12.741 --> 01:08:14.308
Colm?

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:15.143
Moses.

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:17.877
Back of the class.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.049
Now sideways to purgatory.

01:08:21.917 --> 01:08:23.683
♪ Thou ♪

01:08:23.685 --> 01:08:25.551

01:08:28.957 --> 01:08:32.127
♪ Steal ♪

01:08:33.563 --> 01:08:36.529
And how long might we
have to live in purgatory

01:08:36.532 --> 01:08:38.433
if we don't repent?

01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:41.067
A very
long time, Sister.

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:42.871
To Heaven or to

01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:45.774
hell.

01:08:46.942 --> 01:08:47.676
Sister,
would this be Limbo?

01:09:10.732 --> 01:09:11.997
On your knees.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.042
The time to start.

01:09:27.249 --> 01:09:28.282
Now.

01:09:29.752 --> 01:09:31.018
Please forgive me Lord

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:32.551
for I am very sorry
for what I've done.

01:09:32.554 --> 01:09:34.020
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:09:34.022 --> 01:09:36.290
for I am very sorry
for what I've done.

01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:38.259
Say your prayers.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.859
Sorry for
what I've done.

01:09:39.861 --> 01:09:41.127
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:09:41.129 --> 01:09:42.395
for I am very sorry
for what I've done.

01:09:42.397 --> 01:09:43.898
Forgive me Lord.

01:09:43.899 --> 01:09:44.899
Please forgive me
Lord for what I've done.

01:09:44.901 --> 01:09:47.466
We'll have a short break now.

01:09:47.469 --> 01:09:50.906
Be back here in 10 minutes.

01:10:00.482 --> 01:10:02.649
Excuse me, Sister.

01:10:02.651 --> 01:10:03.485
Yes, child.

01:10:05.053 --> 01:10:08.956
Um, I know I have a few
more hours of prayer left,

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:10.858
but I was wondering if I
could leave a little early.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:12.059
There's just somewhere
I really need to be

01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:13.693
in about half an hour.

01:10:13.695 --> 01:10:15.962
- Will you have a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

01:10:15.964 --> 01:10:18.632
It's no bother to
pour an extra cup,

01:10:18.634 --> 01:10:21.070
and we might as well
not waste the water.

01:10:26.942 --> 01:10:28.475
It really is a
beautiful building.

01:10:28.477 --> 01:10:30.144
Indeed it is.

01:10:30.146 --> 01:10:32.445
It'll be an awful shame
when we have to leave it.

01:10:32.447 --> 01:10:34.515
You didn't raise enough
to save the school?

01:10:34.517 --> 01:10:36.550
Unfortunately not.

01:10:36.552 --> 01:10:37.917
Couldn't you
just use the money

01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:39.854
that was left on your doorstep?

01:10:39.856 --> 01:10:41.190
No, child.

01:10:42.659 --> 01:10:45.259
Now that I know
where it came from,

01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:48.561
I'm going to have to ensure
that those that stole it,

01:10:48.563 --> 01:10:51.066
return it to its rightful owner.

01:10:52.134 --> 01:10:53.967
And where will you live?

01:10:53.969 --> 01:10:55.370
I imagine it won't be far.

01:10:56.806 --> 01:11:01.074
Not like yourself having
to live thousands of miles

01:11:01.076 --> 01:11:02.743
from your homeland.

01:11:02.745 --> 01:11:05.880
Actually that's why
I need to leave early.

01:11:05.882 --> 01:11:07.250
I'm gonna move
there permanently.

01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:10.885
My flight's at seven, and
it's a nonrefundable ticket.

01:11:10.887 --> 01:11:13.787
I suppose that means
that Brendan will want

01:11:13.789 --> 01:11:15.389
to be leaving early, too?

01:11:15.391 --> 01:11:20.096
No, no, actually he's
not coming with me.

01:11:26.102 --> 01:11:29.502
Did Brendan ever tell you
that I was in the church

01:11:29.504 --> 01:11:31.706
on the morning you got married?

01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:33.239
Yeah, he mentioned it.

01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:37.177
I remember the two of
ye walking down the aisle

01:11:37.179 --> 01:11:40.715
with the love of each
other deep in your hearts.

01:11:40.717 --> 01:11:42.750
It was an exciting time.

01:11:42.752 --> 01:11:45.554
And it's not anymore?

01:11:50.325 --> 01:11:54.360
You know I traveled
to your country once.

01:11:54.362 --> 01:11:56.029
Really?

01:11:56.031 --> 01:12:00.201
I still remember the excitement
of stepping on a plane

01:12:00.203 --> 01:12:03.239
for the first time in my life,

01:12:04.639 --> 01:12:08.109
and being raised up from
the ground, and after that,

01:12:08.111 --> 01:12:12.546
ah, it was nothing to see
at all only long stretches

01:12:12.548 --> 01:12:17.083
of ocean that bored
me to distraction.

01:12:17.085 --> 01:12:18.685
Something I could
never have imagined

01:12:18.687 --> 01:12:20.186
in the very first moments

01:12:20.188 --> 01:12:24.560
when I was being
elevated to the heavens.

01:12:26.995 --> 01:12:28.663
But you know something,

01:12:30.365 --> 01:12:33.668
it was a truly
wonderful journey.

01:12:38.508 --> 01:12:42.076
You're free to do
whatever you please.

01:12:42.078 --> 01:12:43.913
But choose wisely, child.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:47.784
There's one thing you have
to remember about life,

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:51.953
it's completely
nonrefundable, too.

01:12:58.261 --> 01:13:00.493
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:13:00.495 --> 01:13:01.929
for I am very sorry
for what I've done.

01:13:01.931 --> 01:13:03.163
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:13:03.165 --> 01:13:05.198
for I am sorry for
what I've done.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.567
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:13:06.569 --> 01:13:08.769
for I am sorry for
what I've done.

01:13:08.771 --> 01:13:10.270
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:13:10.272 --> 01:13:13.107
for I am sorry for
what I've done.

01:13:13.109 --> 01:13:14.341
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:13:14.343 --> 01:13:16.911
for I am sorry for
what I've done.

01:13:16.913 --> 01:13:18.144
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:13:18.146 --> 01:13:21.047
for I am sorry for
what I've done.

01:13:21.049 --> 01:13:22.283
Please forgive me, Lord,

01:13:22.285 --> 01:13:23.583
for I am sorry for
what I've done.

01:13:29.558 --> 01:13:31.257
You know if we ever wanted
to commit another crime,

01:13:31.259 --> 01:13:33.860
I think we've done enough penance
to be forgiven in advance.

01:13:33.862 --> 01:13:35.463
That is true.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:39.300
So what was it that
changed your mind about us?

01:13:39.302 --> 01:13:41.868
I just figured even if
there's gonna be long stretches

01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:44.971
of ocean that I didn't want to
be staring at it without you.

01:13:44.973 --> 01:13:48.377
Well I don't exactly know
what that means, but I like it.

01:13:49.812 --> 01:13:50.577
Hm, you know what's
gonna be really exciting?

01:13:50.579 --> 01:13:51.845
What?

01:13:51.847 --> 01:13:53.279
Paying all of
our bills on time

01:13:53.281 --> 01:13:54.982
and still being able
to follow our dream.

01:13:54.984 --> 01:13:56.583
Yeah, that would be exciting,

01:13:56.585 --> 01:14:00.954
but I don't really know how
we could afford a prototype.

01:14:00.956 --> 01:14:02.157
I think there's a way.

01:14:04.994 --> 01:14:08.095
The thing is Mr. McSweeny,

01:14:08.097 --> 01:14:10.764
we have it on very
good authority

01:14:10.766 --> 01:14:13.766
that you were in possession
of a large sum of money

01:14:13.768 --> 01:14:15.536
which had never been declared

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:18.372
to the governmental
offices of taxation.

01:14:18.374 --> 01:14:19.873
Revenue.

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:22.275
And the pair of us fellas
being officers of the law

01:14:22.277 --> 01:14:23.978
and also being in possession

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.680
of a very high level
of detection skills,

01:14:26.682 --> 01:14:30.818
have taken it upon ourselves
to get to the very bottom...

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:31.654
Core.

01:14:34.056 --> 01:14:37.558
The very bottom
of the situation.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:42.565
Now for starters, I
want you to show me

01:14:43.766 --> 01:14:45.832
all records of all
transactions made

01:14:45.834 --> 01:14:48.269
by this company over the past...

01:14:48.271 --> 01:14:49.105
Two.

01:14:50.606 --> 01:14:51.440
Five.

01:14:52.307 --> 01:14:53.141
Four.

01:14:55.311 --> 01:14:57.013
Six years.

01:14:58.213 --> 01:14:59.514
I'll see what I can find.

01:15:01.883 --> 01:15:02.717
Good man.

01:15:12.428 --> 01:15:13.863
How's it going there lads?

01:15:15.932 --> 01:15:17.564
Ye got
my anonymous letter

01:15:17.566 --> 01:15:20.199
about McSweeny, did ye?

01:15:20.201 --> 01:15:21.270
Oh begod we did.

01:15:24.005 --> 01:15:26.239
And right here's
all the evidence

01:15:26.241 --> 01:15:27.741
they're ever going to need.

01:15:27.743 --> 01:15:30.077
And we should have known
that it was from you.

01:15:30.079 --> 01:15:31.612
Shouldn't we Kieran?

01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:34.348
Oh we should have, yeah,
we definitely should have.

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:35.882
You're going to give me

01:15:35.884 --> 01:15:39.019
and the other workers the
25% raise that we deserve.

01:15:39.021 --> 01:15:43.122
You will also be required to
make a legitimate donation

01:15:43.124 --> 01:15:44.358
to the convent down the road

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.126
to stop their school
from closing down.

01:15:46.128 --> 01:15:48.761
I mean, here
was the two of us,

01:15:48.763 --> 01:15:51.732
thinking that we had
our first ever sniff

01:15:51.734 --> 01:15:53.134
of a white collar crime.

01:15:55.236 --> 01:15:58.471
And the whole time it
was nothing more than you

01:15:58.473 --> 01:16:00.373
getting the two of
us back for sending

01:16:00.375 --> 01:16:02.176
that pair of detectives
around to your house.

01:16:02.178 --> 01:16:03.810
That's exactly right.

01:16:03.812 --> 01:16:05.578
I made
the whole thing up.

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.181
Because my friend over
there is the only one

01:16:08.183 --> 01:16:11.652
with the power to keep those
two guards off your back.

01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:15.088
You're going to provide him and
his wife with enough capital

01:16:15.090 --> 01:16:17.358
to get their new business
venture off the ground.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.193
And I got you a
beauty, didn't I?

01:16:19.195 --> 01:16:20.927
You absolutely did,
didn't he, Kieran.

01:16:20.929 --> 01:16:22.162
Oh begod, he did.

01:16:22.164 --> 01:16:23.630
Now why would
I do any of that?

01:16:23.632 --> 01:16:25.899
Sure the worst that could
happen me is I'll have

01:16:25.901 --> 01:16:28.469
to pay some back taxes,

01:16:28.471 --> 01:16:30.703
but it's not the kind of
crime they'll throw a guy

01:16:30.705 --> 01:16:33.241
in jail for, but
you know what is?

01:16:35.177 --> 01:16:36.109
Robbery.

01:16:36.111 --> 01:16:38.811
So who's the bastard now, hah?

01:16:38.813 --> 01:16:40.413
Oh you are.

01:16:40.415 --> 01:16:41.982
You're definitely the bastard.

01:16:41.984 --> 01:16:43.218
This is for you.

01:16:44.954 --> 01:16:47.787
Fair play to you,
boy.

01:16:47.789 --> 01:16:49.189
So it's you, is it?

01:16:49.191 --> 01:16:51.824
You dirty rotten scoundrel.

01:16:51.826 --> 01:16:54.894
Now you listen to me
you filthy mongrel

01:16:54.896 --> 01:16:57.864
with your young high heeled
hussy stretched out on a couch

01:16:57.866 --> 01:16:59.666
in the middle of the night,

01:16:59.668 --> 01:17:04.304
if I ever find out who you
are and where you live,

01:17:04.306 --> 01:17:07.940
your wife will most definitely
be getting a visit from me.

01:17:07.942 --> 01:17:11.980
You dirty, lying, cheating
son of a six-legged goat.

01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:17.583
I can't give you his wife's
name and address just yet,

01:17:17.585 --> 01:17:20.753
but I'll definitely let you
know if anything changes,

01:17:20.755 --> 01:17:22.958
okay, bye now, bye bye.

01:17:34.035 --> 01:17:35.034
That was great,
that was great.

01:17:35.036 --> 01:17:36.670
I mean you'd have to admit

01:17:36.672 --> 01:17:38.905
that'd probably be in
top the five, would it?

01:17:38.907 --> 01:17:42.176
- Era, not at all.
- Top 10?

01:17:42.178 --> 01:17:43.476
God no.

01:17:43.478 --> 01:17:45.746
Top 15?

01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:46.747
25.

01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:48.951
25, well that's,

01:17:49.919 --> 01:17:52.752
I suppose that's better than 20.

01:17:52.754 --> 01:17:54.188
Ah you've a
long way to go yet.

01:18:01.763 --> 01:18:03.463
Test recording
for the talking fridge, Colm.

01:18:03.465 --> 01:18:06.600
Closing the
button on your pants

01:18:06.602 --> 01:18:09.036
won't hurt if you choose
the frozen yogurt.

01:18:09.038 --> 01:18:11.537
What, pants doesn't
rhyme with yogurt.

01:18:11.539 --> 01:18:13.172
No, no, no, hurt and yogurt.

01:18:13.174 --> 01:18:14.841
BRENDAN AND
NICOLE: No, no, no,

01:18:14.843 --> 01:18:16.810
disqualified, disqualified, boo.

01:18:16.812 --> 01:18:17.644
How am I disqualified?

01:18:17.646 --> 01:18:18.644
It's hurt and yogurt.

01:18:18.646 --> 01:18:19.846
If you eat too
much cheesecake,

01:18:19.848 --> 01:18:21.081
looking in the mirror
will make you want

01:18:21.083 --> 01:18:23.350
to jump in the lake.

01:18:23.352 --> 01:18:24.585
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah.

01:18:24.587 --> 01:18:25.551
- Yeah, it's not bad.
- I like that one.

01:18:25.553 --> 01:18:26.752
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:26.754 --> 01:18:28.287
How about, If you
eat too much chocolate,

01:18:28.289 --> 01:18:31.425
you should be lined up
against a wall and shot.

01:18:31.427 --> 01:18:33.060
- Oh oh.
- Oh.

01:18:33.062 --> 01:18:33.894
- Yeah.
- Over.

01:18:33.896 --> 01:18:35.128
Come on Girls.

01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:36.729
Come on girls, welcome
back, welcome back.

01:18:36.731 --> 01:18:38.433
No, no, Sinead, this way.

01:18:43.338 --> 01:18:45.807
- Sorry that we're late.
- Ah come on, girls.

01:18:51.379 --> 01:18:53.548
There you go.

01:18:54.282 --> 01:18:55.716
Derry.

01:19:02.924 --> 01:19:05.391
- Hey.
- Hey, I think this is it.

01:19:05.393 --> 01:19:07.493
- What, the prototype?
- Yeah.

01:19:07.495 --> 01:19:09.498
- You want to try it out?
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

01:19:11.333 --> 01:19:12.866
Thank you.

01:19:12.868 --> 01:19:14.835
If you're
doing penance for a crime,

01:19:14.837 --> 01:19:16.702
tasting Brussels sprouts
will do just fine.

01:19:16.704 --> 01:19:18.573
It works.

01:19:25.847 --> 01:19:27.346
If you listen
to all our health tips,

01:19:27.348 --> 01:19:29.815
your heart will really love
what touches your lips.

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:33.186
I like that one.

01:19:33.188 --> 01:19:34.954
So how many have we sold today?

01:19:34.956 --> 01:19:36.489
Ah, about a
hundred euro's worth.

01:19:36.491 --> 01:19:38.391
Wow, that's not bad
for a Monday morning.

01:19:38.393 --> 01:19:41.295
- No, it's not.
- So what time's your class?

01:19:41.297 --> 01:19:42.128
1:30.

01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:43.363
What is it today?

01:19:43.365 --> 01:19:45.134
- Kids' nutrition.
- Right, great.

01:19:48.102 --> 01:19:49.068
Hello.

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:50.304
- Mr. McCarthy?
- Yes.

01:19:50.306 --> 01:19:52.738
This is the
immigration office,

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.309
and we regret to inform you
that your wife's application

01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:57.711
for Irish residency
has been denied.

01:19:57.713 --> 01:19:59.179
At the
interview, they said it was...

01:19:59.181 --> 01:20:01.415
And she is hereby
instructed to leave the country.

01:20:01.417 --> 01:20:03.382
No, I mean I don't understand.

01:20:03.384 --> 01:20:04.585
She's my wife and...

01:20:04.587 --> 01:20:07.820
We got
you an absolute beauty.

01:20:07.822 --> 01:20:09.655
Didn't we Kieran?

01:20:09.657 --> 01:20:11.794
Oh we did, we definitely did.

01:20:12.962 --> 01:20:15.194
So who's the
bastard now, hah?

01:20:15.196 --> 01:20:17.396
You are, you're
definitely the bastard.

01:20:17.398 --> 01:20:18.834
And don't you forget it.

01:20:20.335 --> 01:20:22.034
I don't think this
is ever gonna stop.

01:20:22.036 --> 01:20:23.869
Well least it keep
things interesting.

01:20:23.871 --> 01:20:25.305
Yeah,
but I can't believe

01:20:25.307 --> 01:20:27.073
I'm not the bastard anymore.

01:20:27.075 --> 01:20:28.341
Ah,
that's okay, honey.

01:20:28.343 --> 01:20:30.543
I'm sure that you'll be
the bastard again soon.

01:20:30.545 --> 01:20:32.380
I hope so.
