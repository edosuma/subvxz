00:41.008 --> 00:43.277
Hello.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.113
Several blocks, still.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.849
I'd say maybe ten minutes.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.251
Mateen?

00:50.351 --> 00:51.685
Is he safe?

00:53.020 --> 00:55.623
Thank you, Bill.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.333
Inshallah.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.056
Yes, I understand you're upset,

02:03.157 --> 02:04.825
but this is not up
for discussion.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.228
I... No, I'm being
perfectly reasonable.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.896
And...

02:08.996 --> 02:11.131
Sweetheart, I can tell
those are fake tears

02:11.232 --> 02:12.733
even though I can't see you.

02:12.833 --> 02:14.868
All right, we're gonna talk
about this later tonight.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.405
Just know that I
love you and y...

02:22.276 --> 02:24.111
Hi.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.715
What was that?

02:27.815 --> 02:31.118
That was the never-ending
pushback of a preteen.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.886
It's exhausting.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.423
But Victoria's
the sweetest kid I know.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.124
Oh, sure,
whenever you're around.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.693
As soon as you leave, she morphs
into some devil spawn hell-bent

02:39.793 --> 02:42.162
on questioning every word
that comes out of my mouth.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.164
The wonders of adolescence. Hmm.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.799
So what are we
not discussing?

02:45.899 --> 02:47.835
Yeah, she wants
to go out this weekend

02:47.935 --> 02:49.537
with her friends to a movie.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.006
With boys.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.142
Her first group date?

02:55.243 --> 02:56.410
That's adorable.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.811
Okay, first off, no.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.213
It's not. Secondly,

02:59.313 --> 03:01.315
we don't use that word "date."

03:01.415 --> 03:03.083
Oh.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.686
I know that look.
What look?

03:05.786 --> 03:06.920
You purse your lips
like that

03:07.020 --> 03:08.689
whenever I order
pineapple on pizza.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.724
Well, if you want
to eat soggy pizza,

03:10.824 --> 03:12.426
you might as well
just dip it in water.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.695
Jess, you're biting your tongue.
Come on, just spill it. What?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.764
I just don't see
what the big deal is

03:16.864 --> 03:19.267
about Vic going out
on her first group...

03:19.367 --> 03:20.501
hang.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
The big deal is,
it's unchaperoned.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.538
The bigger deal is Austin.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.507
The city?
No, it's a boy.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.741
I don't know who he is.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.278
Vic talks about him nonstop.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.845
Austin.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.881
You know, you never forget
your first crush.

03:33.981 --> 03:37.217
Elliot Spencer had
the cutest dimples.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.086
Okay, well, she is not gonna
remember Austin because

03:39.186 --> 03:41.789
this thing's not happening,
not unless I get to tag along.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.090
Oh.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.825
You're doing
the pineapple lips again.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.960
I just don't know
if you want to be that dad.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.996
How does this make me that dad?

03:49.096 --> 03:51.365
I mean, she is way too young
for this, right?

03:51.465 --> 03:53.033
I wonder
if it's more about whether

03:53.133 --> 03:55.102
Vic is mature enough
to handle this?

03:55.202 --> 03:58.372
Oh, certainly she is,
but the boys are not.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.907
I used to be
one of those boys, okay?

04:00.007 --> 04:01.409
I know what hormones can do.

04:01.509 --> 04:02.710
And...

04:04.612 --> 04:06.980
Maybe just... sit with it.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.082
You don't want to let
a knee-jerk reaction

04:09.182 --> 04:11.051
cause a rift
between you and your daughter.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.922
I'm getting pretty sick
of hearing myself say

04:15.022 --> 04:17.358
"Over my dead body" about this.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.426
That's good.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.629
That's bad.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.697
Speaking of bodies,
we have a body

04:23.797 --> 04:26.166
waiting for us in Norfolk.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.737
Austin.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.105
My first crush was
Emily Tisdale.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.041
Oh, man, I had
it bad for her.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.509
How'd you meet?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.710
Middle school.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.812
We were, uh, rivals. Mathletes.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.515
She could recite pi to a
thousand digits. It was so hot.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.716
What about you,
Nick?

04:42.816 --> 04:43.851
Yeah, bet you
had your choice

04:43.951 --> 04:45.686
of, uh, girls
crushing on you.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.821
Actually, <i>peque√±o</i> Nico was a,

04:47.921 --> 04:50.257
uh, late bloomer.
What?

04:50.358 --> 04:52.493
I always figured you were
the boy parents were terrified

04:52.593 --> 04:54.194
to have
their daughters around.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.497
Well, believe it or not,
this handsome face was terrified

04:56.597 --> 04:58.499
of those daughters
until high school.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.200
So who brought you around?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.802
Oh, my Sofia.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.704
She was my first date.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.507
I was so nervous that I went
to the wrong restaurant.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.976
That's what Jimmy doesn't get.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.846
Victoria deserves a future
walk down memory lane about...

05:12.946 --> 05:15.282
Austin.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.787
Wow, that is
a lot of blood.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.223
Yeah, courtesy of what appears
to be a kitchen knife.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.426
My guess is, it severed
the carotid artery.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.227
And then he lost consciousness.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.096
And his heart kept pumping.
Who is he?

05:29.196 --> 05:32.199
He is
Marine Private William Huxley.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.535
Neighbor walking the dog
noticed the garage door open.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.836
Dog did the rest.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.237
Led him right in here
to this body.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.606
Time of death?

05:38.706 --> 05:40.408
Given lividity,
I would say he bled out

05:40.508 --> 05:42.175
somewhere around 12 hours ago.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.311
Look at all this
flour, sugar, oil.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.246
Enough ingredients
to feed an entire platoon.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.281
Yeah, I wonder
who he was cooking for.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.483
Not his family.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.951
According to Huxley's
service record,

05:51.051 --> 05:52.786
he was single, no kids.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.822
Ooh, that reminds me.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.490
I got to pick up chocolate chips

05:56.590 --> 05:58.158
for the twins'
bake sale cookies.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.259
Hey, McGee.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.462
It's too bad these are evidence.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.096
'Cause you could have...

06:03.196 --> 06:04.832
Unfortunately, Delilah insists

06:04.932 --> 06:06.767
upon at least 70% dark chocolate

06:06.867 --> 06:08.702
'cause it's healthier.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.370
As a doctor,
I can attest to that.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.006
More importantly,
way more delish, right?

06:13.106 --> 06:15.375
How about we finish grocery
shopping later and...

06:15.476 --> 06:16.944
figure out what happened here?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.813
Looks like the killer jumped him
as he unloaded the car?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.381
Guys, is it me, or does, uh,

06:21.482 --> 06:24.618
Huxley have a lot of gray hair
for a Marine private?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.487
He does look kind of elder
for a grunt.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.556
Yeah, you're right.
His license says Huxley was 46.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.591
Corps's oldest-serving private.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.659
There's got to be a story there.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.961
There is, and it's a whopper.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.796
According to his former C.O.,

06:35.896 --> 06:37.831
Huxley was
a gunnery sergeant who used

06:37.931 --> 06:39.800
to lead
a Marine Force Recon team.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.502
Force Recon?

06:41.602 --> 06:44.271
Wow, those guys are badasses.
They go toe to toe with SEALs.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.306
He must have really screwed up
to get busted down to private.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.375
He pulled multiple tours
in Afghanistan,

06:48.476 --> 06:51.344
then he went missing from his
unit after the U.S. withdrawal

06:51.445 --> 06:52.780
and, uh...

06:52.880 --> 06:54.515
was declared a deserter.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.983
Where'd he go?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.985
Back to Afghanistan.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.887
Apparently,
Huxley returned to Kabul

06:59.987 --> 07:02.490
to sneak out
more families and allies

07:02.590 --> 07:04.224
who missed the airlift.

07:04.324 --> 07:07.127
He really held on to the Marine
code of "leave no man behind."

07:07.227 --> 07:08.562
Even at the risk
of his own career.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.197
Sounded like a hero to me.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.565
Yeah, well,

07:11.665 --> 07:13.901
clearly someone disagrees.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.311
All right, Doc, what do we got?
Stop.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.313
No food
while a body's on the table.

07:26.413 --> 07:27.815
There's a trash can
in the hallway there.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.417
Well, the only way
that I'm disposing

07:30.518 --> 07:32.185
of this, uh, deep-fried,

07:32.285 --> 07:33.787
perfectly pistachio-ed treat

07:33.887 --> 07:36.223
is in my belly.
Yeah, what kind of pastry is it?

07:36.323 --> 07:38.492
I don't know, but it's
the third one I've had today.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.027
It's like baklava, but...

07:40.127 --> 07:42.295
I've never tasted anything
like this before.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.764
Huh, where'd you get it?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.332
I was interviewing, uh,
one of Huxley's neighbors

07:45.432 --> 07:47.100
and she offered them, said

07:47.200 --> 07:49.837
he baked treats for everyone
on the block all the time.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.706
Must be why he had all those
baking supplies in his SUV.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.510
The guy on your table was
a damn gastronomic genius.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.278
He was serving out
the rest of his tour

07:58.378 --> 08:00.347
as a Marine
food service specialist.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.982
He was demoted to a cook?

08:02.082 --> 08:03.150
A chef.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.485
A chef that we will avenge.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.923
Well, what do we know about
our Private Huxley here?

08:10.023 --> 08:12.492
Well, as I suspected,
cause of death was

08:12.593 --> 08:15.428
penetrating trauma
due to the knife wound.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.698
The murder weapon was
a paring knife

08:17.798 --> 08:19.933
that severed
the external carotid artery.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.435
Exsanguination took one,
maybe two minutes.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.037
Huxley was Special Ops-trained.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.973
It's hard to imagine anyone
would get the drop on him

08:26.073 --> 08:27.608
for a close-range kill.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.110
He must have known his attacker.
Allowed 'em to get close enough,

08:30.210 --> 08:31.812
catch him off guard.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.881
I heard, uh...

08:33.981 --> 08:36.216
your daughter caught you
off guard this morning.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.851
Something about
the, uh...

08:37.951 --> 08:39.587
big first date?

08:39.687 --> 08:41.454
We don't use that word "date."

08:41.555 --> 08:42.890
No, and there is none.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.157
At least not yet.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.059
You're thinking
about letting her go?

08:47.695 --> 08:50.030
Jess says that I should
"sit with it"

08:50.130 --> 08:52.265
so I don't make
any decisions clouded

08:52.365 --> 08:54.201
by parental emotions.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.470
You ever think
about doing a little, uh,

08:57.571 --> 09:00.140
light background check
on the kid?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.576
Nothing creepy.
Just, you know, maybe

09:02.676 --> 09:04.344
peruse
his social media accounts.

09:04.444 --> 09:05.613
That's not creepy?

09:05.713 --> 09:07.480
Checking his likes and dislikes

09:07.581 --> 09:09.683
to make sure
he's no juvenile delinquent

09:09.783 --> 09:11.719
like I was?
No, no, not at all.

09:11.819 --> 09:13.921
Oh, I-I guess kids
do put it all out

09:14.021 --> 09:16.089
on social media
for anyone to see.

09:16.189 --> 09:16.990
What could it hurt?

09:17.090 --> 09:18.692
Yeah.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.293
<i>A paring knife is</i>

09:20.393 --> 09:21.595
a chef's favorite.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.463
Small but mighty,
this bad boy can cut,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.399
chop, slice, and dice
with ninja precision.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.968
Any prints on it?
No.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.003
And given that the killer
left it in our victim's neck,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.872
they were likely smart enough
to use gloves.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.641
Any way to find out
where the knife came from?

09:33.741 --> 09:36.276
Well, it is a standard four-inch
stainless-steel blade,

09:36.376 --> 09:37.811
so not likely.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.412
Any chef who knows their way
around the kitchen

09:39.512 --> 09:41.281
has access to one, but...

09:41.381 --> 09:43.150
holster those
frowny faces because

09:43.250 --> 09:45.585
I found you
a bread crumb to nibble on.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.755
That paring knife
is covered

09:47.855 --> 09:51.224
in asafetida,
a popular spice primarily grown

09:51.324 --> 09:54.094
in Afghanistan and Iran.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.665
Parker did say that Huxley did
multiple tours in Afghanistan.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.466
Asafetida is a delicacy there,

09:59.566 --> 10:01.234
known as the "food
of the gods."

10:01.334 --> 10:03.570
Whoa.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.506
What he said.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.909
That pungent aroma
may be divisive to some,

10:09.009 --> 10:12.379
but once heated,
it releases a delicious flavor,

10:12.479 --> 10:14.715
similar to, uh, onions or leeks.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.050
So if our murder weapon
is covered in asa...

10:17.150 --> 10:17.951
...fetida,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.186
it most likely came

10:19.286 --> 10:20.220
from a kitchen well-versed

10:20.320 --> 10:21.588
in Central Asian cooking.

10:21.689 --> 10:24.624
What if Huxley's killer
was a rival chef?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.994
Look at this, just pulled up
his doorbell cam footage.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.428
Look what I found.

10:28.528 --> 10:29.763
Get out here, Bill!

10:29.863 --> 10:32.232
I am done playing games.
If you steal

10:32.332 --> 10:35.903
one more of my catering clients,
I swear I will kill you!

10:36.937 --> 10:39.339
She makes
a really good Karen.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.440
As it turns out,

10:40.540 --> 10:42.542
her name actually is Karen.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.543
Karen Graham.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.078
Hey, names are fate.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.680
Fun fact, as a Parker

10:46.780 --> 10:48.448
I always find good parking.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.551
Well, this Karen is
the neighborhood busybody.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.653
She lives a few blocks
over from Huxley,

10:53.754 --> 10:55.655
and while she has
no arrest record...

10:55.756 --> 10:57.057
At least not yet.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.792
...well, she does have
a long record of calling

10:58.892 --> 11:01.294
the police to get others
arrested on H.O.A. violations.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.697
I've seen this type before.
Entitled. Volatile.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.633
It's just a matter of time
before they explode.

11:09.602 --> 11:10.904
No offense...

11:11.004 --> 11:12.572
Yet I am sensing
a coming offense.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.874
...but what
colorblind moron chose

11:13.974 --> 11:15.508
the palette of these offices?

11:15.608 --> 11:18.045
Not a fan of the, uh,
strong earth tones?

11:18.145 --> 11:20.748
Walking these hallways
seared my retinas.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.649
I'm happy to offer up

11:22.750 --> 11:24.451
my services to redecorate.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.618
Well, maybe
your services can be used

11:25.719 --> 11:27.020
to brighten up
the drab palettes

11:27.120 --> 11:29.456
over at the Virginia
Correctional Center.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.391
Because that's where
you're headed for the murder

11:31.491 --> 11:32.826
of William Huxley.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.896
Uh...

11:35.996 --> 11:37.297
Bill's dead?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.166
Yeah, he was killed
last night in his garage.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.167
Not long

11:40.267 --> 11:41.301
after you showed up there

11:41.401 --> 11:42.502
threatening to kill him.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.871
See where we're going
with this?

11:43.971 --> 11:47.307
Well, I am sorry...
to hear about Bill.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.209
Really, I am.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.411
But I couldn't have killed him
last night.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.981
I was enjoying some...

11:54.081 --> 11:57.484
companionship
with my friend Javier.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.019
Hmm.
Hmm.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.187
He's 22.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.822
Good to know.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.258
We will, uh, be sure
to follow up with Javier.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.693
So we're done then?

12:06.794 --> 12:07.828
Not even close.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.963
How was a Marine cook

12:10.063 --> 12:12.099
stealing catering clients
from you?

12:12.199 --> 12:14.367
Karen's Confectionary

12:14.467 --> 12:17.004
supplies goodies to every
neighborhood gathering.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.639
At least it did until
Bill got back from overseas

12:19.739 --> 12:22.209
and started a side hustle
out of his own kitchen.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.343
Oh, we heard

12:23.443 --> 12:24.511
he was a talented baker.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.114
Oh, I would say he was...

12:27.214 --> 12:28.715
adequate.

12:28.816 --> 12:31.351
But he had that sob story pitch
about donating his profits

12:31.451 --> 12:34.154
to some local Afghan group
he worked with.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.156
Afghan, huh?
Oh, the neighbors--

12:36.256 --> 12:39.026
they ate up his woeful tale
of the displaced refugees

12:39.126 --> 12:41.561
fleeing their war-torn homes.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.998
And then they ate up
all his goodies

12:45.098 --> 12:46.333
instead of mine.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.969
What did Huxley do
with this Afghan group?

12:49.069 --> 12:50.537
They had some community center.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.672
Bill said he would
cook meals for them

12:52.772 --> 12:54.441
that would remind them of home.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.744
Seems like a waste
of time to me.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.281
<i>Promises Honored is a lifeline</i>

13:01.381 --> 13:02.816
<i>for these poor people.</i>

13:02.916 --> 13:04.751
Can you imagine having to start

13:04.852 --> 13:07.054
from scratch in a new country?

13:07.154 --> 13:08.555
Yeah, I can.

13:08.655 --> 13:09.722
Oh.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.160
Well, I hope you had
a community that welcomed you.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.129
That's the whole point
of Promises Honored.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.565
It's to keep the promise
we made to our Afghan allies

13:18.665 --> 13:20.367
who aided us overseas.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.601
By doing what exactly?

13:21.701 --> 13:23.703
Uh, we help
the families find homes,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
we assist
with their job training,

13:25.906 --> 13:27.340
and we teach them
the skills they need

13:27.440 --> 13:28.842
to get by here in America.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.310
Well, it's great
that they have the space

13:30.410 --> 13:31.478
to come together like this.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.513
So many had to leave family

13:33.613 --> 13:34.747
and friends behind.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.249
Spending time here

13:36.349 --> 13:37.817
reminds them that...

13:37.918 --> 13:39.419
they're not alone.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.654
Oh, here.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.291
This is our director,

13:44.391 --> 13:45.692
Pastor Eddie Watkins.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.327
Hello there.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.461
And you would be...?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.030
Special Agent Torres

13:50.130 --> 13:51.965
and Special Agent Knight
from NCIS.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.901
They have some questions
about Bill.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.037
Oh. Uh, Bill is
our favorite volunteer.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.372
Is he okay?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.974
He was supposed to bake cookies

14:01.074 --> 14:02.809
with the kids today
and he never showed up.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.012
That's not like him.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.679
Unfortunately, Private Huxley

14:06.779 --> 14:09.116
was found murdered
earlier today.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.352
What?
I-I'm sorry.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.954
Murdered?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.524
Oh, my God.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.892
Bill-Bill was beloved by us.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.928
He spent every spare minute
he had here.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.495
His devotion

14:22.595 --> 14:25.365
to the Afghan people he worked
alongside was endless.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.000
Bill felt he owed a debt
to the families

14:27.100 --> 14:28.601
he couldn't get out
of Afghanistan.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.038
I understand that Bill used to
cook a lot for the refugees?

14:31.138 --> 14:32.405
That was Bill's specialty.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.208
All the Afghans
were impressed

14:35.308 --> 14:37.077
with his mastery
of their cuisine.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.913
We are gonna need
to see the kitchen.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.982
Yeah.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.754
You smell that?

14:47.854 --> 14:49.856
How could you not?

14:49.957 --> 14:52.359
Asafetida?
Yes, oh, yes.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.228
It stinks to high heaven,
but the flavor's divine.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.965
All his knives are here.
All except the paring knife.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.466
Handle matches
the murder weapon.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.401
Who has access to this kitchen?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.570
Um, this is a community kitchen.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.172
Everyone can just walk right in.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.506
Anybody had a problem
with Huxley?

15:06.606 --> 15:07.674
No.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.276
Everyone loved Bill.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.878
Everyone?
Mateen.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.314
Who is Mateen?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
Mateen Jamaah.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.552
He's a young refugee
we work with.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.655
He and Bill had a...

15:22.755 --> 15:24.257
strained relationship.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.859
Why?
The Taliban executed
Mateen's parents

15:26.960 --> 15:29.262
before Bill and his unit
could get them out.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.999
Oh, my God.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.800
I saw Mateen and Bill
arguing here

15:33.900 --> 15:35.268
yesterday at-at the center.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.736
What about?
Well, I couldn't hear.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.071
But it looked heated.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.839
Mateen left
and I went over to Bill.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.574
He said it was nothing.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.478
Mateen was supposed
to help us sort

15:45.578 --> 15:48.515
through clothing donations last
night, but he never showed up.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.785
Guess he had other plans.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.898
Mateen Jamaah arrived
on a flight from Kabul

16:05.999 --> 16:07.434
August 20 of 2021.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.702
Promises Honored helped him
settle into an apartment,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.438
which we searched,
but came up empty.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.440
I've been trying to ping
his cell, but it's turned off.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.875
What about his work?
He stocked shelves
at a grocery store.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.377
Manual labor?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.379
His file says that
he was a mechanical engineer

16:19.479 --> 16:21.381
who helped our forces
defend against IEDs.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.949
Now he's stocking shelves?

16:23.050 --> 16:25.285
Must have fallen into
the credentials gap trap.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.653
A lot of refugees' degrees

16:26.753 --> 16:27.987
aren't recognized
here in the States.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.290
What was Mateen's connection
to Private Huxley?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.225
Mateen's father worked
alongside Huxley for years

16:32.325 --> 16:33.326
as an interpreter.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.627
And, according
to Mateen,

16:34.727 --> 16:35.928
the two men practically
became brothers.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.397
Huxley helped Mateen flee,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.399
but he didn't
get Mateen's parents out

16:39.499 --> 16:41.334
before the Taliban caught them.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.369
And he never forgave him.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.903
His family's gone.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.272
Career's gone.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.374
You don't think he blames Huxley
for everything?

16:47.474 --> 16:49.109
Well, we can ask him ourselves.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.179
Mateen's boss says
he just came in to work.
Go. Take McGee.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.416
Must be tough going from
engineer to grocery bagger.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.817
Yeah, I mean, I...

16:57.917 --> 16:59.886
I get why Mateen is
bitter, but s-still...

16:59.986 --> 17:02.422
Yeah, and don't take it out on
the Marine who helped you out.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.656
Oh, hello.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.525
I am Special Agent Torres.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.727
This is Special Agent McGee
from NCIS.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.028
We're looking for Mateen Jamaah.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.464
He'll be back any moment
from his break.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.600
Is Mateen in trouble?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.868
No, we just-we just
want to talk.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.772
Are, uh, are most of the workers
here Afghan refugees?

17:20.907 --> 17:22.642
We were all lucky enough
to get out

17:22.742 --> 17:24.711
in the final days
before Kabul fell.

17:24.811 --> 17:27.180
And Promises Honored connected
you all with the jobs here?

17:27.280 --> 17:28.648
Most of us.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.883
Pastor Eddie knows the family
that owns the store.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.052
How are you, uh,
finding America so far?

17:33.153 --> 17:36.589
My family and
I have our lives.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.025
We're immensely
grateful for that.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.761
Well, it doesn't make
starting over any easier.

17:41.861 --> 17:42.795
No.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.597
It does not.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.736
Oh, hey, McGee,

17:49.836 --> 17:52.439
you said you need to get those,
uh, chocolate chips.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.941
Oh, no, at least
70% dark chocolate.

17:55.041 --> 17:57.377
70% dark.
Uh, I got to
go grab those. You...

17:57.477 --> 17:58.411
Aisle three.
Baking goods.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.713
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.118
I wasn't a refugee.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.688
But I remember
looking over my shoulder,

18:08.788 --> 18:10.790
afraid that someone was coming
to send me back.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.160
Where was home for you?

18:13.260 --> 18:14.227
Panama.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.428
And then Colombia,

18:15.528 --> 18:17.464
uh, with my sister and my mom.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.132
My mom worked as a housekeeper

18:19.232 --> 18:21.201
for a man that
she found out was evil,

18:21.301 --> 18:23.069
and she saw some

18:23.170 --> 18:24.471
really bad stuff.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.873
I understand.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.908
We left with

18:29.008 --> 18:31.478
whatever we had on our back,
and we came to United States.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.813
How old were you?
I was 11.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.749
The only English I knew was, uh,

18:36.849 --> 18:39.952
from watching, uh, reruns
of American, uh, television.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.723
Ayy!

18:45.225 --> 18:46.726
You... Okay.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.861
So, no <i>Happy Days</i>
in Afghanistan.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.868
When did life feel normal again?

18:57.670 --> 19:01.007
Some days, still doesn't.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.812
But this is our home.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.152
Ah, Mateen.
There you are.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.056
Hey, Mateen, uh,
Special Agent Torres.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.059
Hey, Mateen!

19:21.361 --> 19:23.596
McGee, we got a runner!

19:29.502 --> 19:31.037
You're only making this worse!

19:38.711 --> 19:40.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where'd he go?
You okay?

19:41.080 --> 19:43.516
I'm fine.
Go get him, go get him.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.823
Mateen's gone.

19:50.923 --> 19:51.991
Nick!

19:52.091 --> 19:53.526
Nick, Nick.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.596
Get him on
his back, now.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.130
First aid's
on aisle five.

19:58.231 --> 20:00.066
Bring me gauze pads,
rubbing alcohol and shears.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.769
Medical tape's out of stock, so
get me duct tape, aisle seven.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.437
Your friend
might be concussed

20:04.537 --> 20:07.607
and is losing blood. I need
to stop it then stabilize him.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.875
You're a doctor.
A surgeon

20:08.975 --> 20:10.777
back in Afghanistan. Okay.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.814
You will be okay, Agent Torres.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.222
Any update on Nick?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.558
Uh, yes, McGee is with him
at the hospital now

20:25.658 --> 20:27.260
and he should be fine,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.061
thanks to the fast work of that
doctor in the grocery store.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.997
BOLO's out on
Mateen Jamaah.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.164
No hits yet.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.633
I've been running
facial recognition

20:33.733 --> 20:35.802
against every camera feed
I could find for blocks.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.036
No sign of him.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.505
Well, we have agents
sitting in front

20:38.605 --> 20:39.906
of his house
in case he comes home.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.041
I had the contents
of Mateen's work locker

20:42.141 --> 20:43.676
sent here so we could
look for clues

20:43.776 --> 20:45.445
that might help us find him.
What are all the stains?

20:45.545 --> 20:47.947
Mass spec's running it now.
I should know soon.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.317
Okay, great, uh, let me know
when you find out.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.057
Does that say...

20:58.157 --> 20:59.992
Austin Marsden?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.628
Jimmy,

21:01.728 --> 21:05.097
are you cyberstalking the boy
who's crushing on Victoria?

21:05.197 --> 21:06.899
No. No.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.436
I was just perusing,
and then I needed

21:09.536 --> 21:11.738
Kasie's second opinion
on what I...

21:11.838 --> 21:13.205
perused.
Uh-huh.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.975
Yeah, and my opinion is

21:16.075 --> 21:17.510
Jimmy's gone mental. Mm.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.646
Okay, I make no apologies.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.382
Austin Marsden
is exhibiting some early

21:22.482 --> 21:23.650
serial killer tendencies.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.784
This boy's barely hit puberty.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.453
It's all in the details here.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.621
Uh, take a look at some of these
foodie pics that he's posted.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.624
Nothing but rare burgers
and steaks.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.860
I mean, that is a scary sign.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.795
A sign that
his growing body

21:35.895 --> 21:37.263
is in desperate
need of protein?

21:37.364 --> 21:40.166
What? No. Like, no...
The-These are basically

21:40.266 --> 21:42.201
mutilated animals.
This is how Dahmer and Bundy

21:42.301 --> 21:44.303
and Gacy all got
their first tastes.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.305
You are reaching, Jimmy.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.575
Okay, that may be,

21:48.675 --> 21:50.877
but... uh, just to be safe,

21:50.977 --> 21:53.245
I think it's time that Austin
and I had a little chat

21:53.346 --> 21:54.313
before the kids meet up.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.482
A little chat?

21:55.582 --> 21:57.049
Yeah, here, at NCIS.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.185
I'll give his whole
family a tour. That way,

21:59.285 --> 22:02.355
Austin can see
what a capable doctor I am.

22:03.189 --> 22:05.625
And also see all
the sharp knives I work with.

22:05.725 --> 22:11.163
Ooh. He has cannonballed into
the overprotective deep end.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.036
Neither of you is the father
to a daughter.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.308
You can't understand it.

22:24.076 --> 22:24.777
Um...

22:24.877 --> 22:26.245
Just got the results

22:26.345 --> 22:27.680
from Mateen's jacket.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.550
The stains are motor oil.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.385
But Mateen doesn't even
own a car.

22:32.485 --> 22:35.187
Maybe he works on them?
It's not just oil
he's working with.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.525
There were also trace amounts
of pentaerythritol tetranitrate,

22:38.625 --> 22:42.261
which is a highly explosive
organic compound.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.930
Motor oil and explosives.

22:44.030 --> 22:48.701
In the hands of a mechanical
engineer who worked with IEDs.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.336
I don't even want to say
what I'm thinking.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.539
It sounds like he's trying
to build a car bomb.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.508
Jimmy just gonna
say it for you.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.677
You sure you don't need
a few days, Agent Torres?

22:57.777 --> 22:58.945
I'm good.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.447
Good, 'cause we need
all hands on deck

23:00.547 --> 23:03.249
if we could be facing
an imminent attack.

23:03.349 --> 23:06.085
My phone's been ringing off the
hook from agencies across town

23:06.185 --> 23:08.087
wondering
if a Taliban sympathizer

23:08.187 --> 23:10.256
may have slipped through
the cracks on our airlift.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.525
We doubt that Mateen is
aligned with the Taliban,

23:12.625 --> 23:14.727
given what happened to
his mother and father.

23:14.827 --> 23:15.928
He could be trying
to strike back at a country

23:16.028 --> 23:17.196
he feels abandoned him.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.465
A revenge attack

23:18.565 --> 23:19.966
because his parents
never made it out.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.734
Then why kill Private Huxley?

23:21.834 --> 23:22.969
If Mateen is building a bomb

23:23.069 --> 23:24.704
and Private Huxley
found out about it,

23:24.804 --> 23:25.938
maybe that's why
Mateen killed him.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.940
Find Mateen. Now.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.844
Hey. Dr. Rajab.

23:31.944 --> 23:32.979
What are you doing here?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.581
Please, it's Veeda.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.248
And what kind of
doctor would I be

23:36.348 --> 23:38.551
if I didn't do a follow-up
with my patient?

23:38.651 --> 23:40.419
Right.
May I?

23:41.420 --> 23:42.755
Sure.

23:42.855 --> 23:46.659
Whoever stitched you up
did an okay job, but...

23:46.759 --> 23:47.994
I could have done better.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.796
Well, maybe you
should have escorted me

23:49.896 --> 23:51.330
to the emergency room.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.268
Veeda is the one
who came to Nick's aid.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.837
I'm getting that.

23:58.638 --> 24:02.809
Sorry to intrude, but I
heard about Bill Huxley.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.343
He was a good man.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.312
Do you really think
Mateen did this?

24:06.412 --> 24:08.515
It's just hard to believe
that he could do

24:08.615 --> 24:09.782
something
so horrible.

24:09.882 --> 24:12.184
He's kind and
polite to everyone.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.887
Working two jobs just
to make ends meet.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.623
Mateen has a second job?

24:16.723 --> 24:20.226
Back in Kabul, he'd help
repair your military vehicles.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.929
So he isn't just a mechanical
engineer, he's also a mechanic?

24:23.029 --> 24:25.197
Yes. Doing
the same here.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.734
Paid-- what do
Americans say--

24:27.834 --> 24:28.801
under the table.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.169
Auto repair shop

24:30.269 --> 24:32.338
would have metalworking tools.
And tools

24:32.438 --> 24:35.207
that Mateen would need
if he was in fact making...

24:37.476 --> 24:39.045
...something.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.847
We need to find Mateen.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.582
Do you know
where he was fixing cars?

24:42.682 --> 24:44.183
I don't. I'm sorry.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.417
And Mateen ditched his phone.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.319
But if he made
any previous calls

24:47.419 --> 24:49.789
from an auto shop, would have
bounced off the nearest tower.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.624
I'll pull his call logs,
see which tower

24:51.724 --> 24:53.960
is near a
repair place.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.274
Federal
agents!

25:09.475 --> 25:10.209
Drop the drill.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.745
Back away from the bomb.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.047
Put your hands
slowly behind your head.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.216
I'm sorry I ran before.

25:17.316 --> 25:20.186
But please just let me explain
before they get here.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.554
Who's they?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.858
Gun!

25:26.559 --> 25:28.595
There it is!

25:33.099 --> 25:34.366
What are you doing?!

25:34.466 --> 25:35.868
Shooting at the guys
that are shooting at us!

25:35.968 --> 25:37.136
Don't shoot towards the bomb!

25:37.236 --> 25:38.605
Well, if it goes off,
it'll kill them.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.006
And us, too.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.246
What the hell's
going on?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.625
Who were you building
that bomb for?

25:58.725 --> 26:01.393
You must believe me
when I say I have no idea.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.229
My only contact

26:03.329 --> 26:04.396
with them was through texts.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.866
But you did what
they said. Why?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.269
My fianc√©e, Asal.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.471
She is in danger.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.540
She is my everything.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.108
The only family I have left.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.978
Is she being held
by the men who took the bomb?
No.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.681
Asal and I were separated
during the airlift.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.549
She's been stuck
at a camp in Turkey.

26:23.650 --> 26:24.951
How do you know
she's in danger?

26:25.051 --> 26:27.486
I got a text from
an unknown number weeks ago.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.689
Photos of Asal
at the camp.

26:29.789 --> 26:32.158
She looked so scared.

26:34.226 --> 26:37.496
Whoever sent the photos said
I had to build them a bomb

26:37.596 --> 26:38.965
or they would kill her.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.367
How many innocent people
will be killed

26:41.467 --> 26:42.534
when they use that bomb?

26:42.635 --> 26:43.836
No one will.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.171
The bomb is harmless.
It was filled

26:45.271 --> 26:47.039
with explosive materials
found on your jacket.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.908
Yes, but I built it
with a fail-safe.

26:49.008 --> 26:52.011
The remote detonator mechanism
I inserted doesn't work.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.145
It's a dud?

26:53.245 --> 26:54.246
I would never give them something

26:54.346 --> 26:55.748
that could actually hurt people.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.917
I fled my homeland
because of vile men like that.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.289
What were you
and Private Huxley

27:03.389 --> 27:04.456
arguing about

27:04.556 --> 27:06.158
before he
was murdered?

27:07.694 --> 27:09.395
When the explosives
showed up at my apartment,

27:09.495 --> 27:10.963
I went to Bill for help.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.465
After what happened to my
parents, he said he owed me.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.334
Promised to reunite me
with Asal.

27:15.434 --> 27:20.206
Private Huxley was trying
to find out who was behind this

27:20.306 --> 27:21.774
for you?

27:21.874 --> 27:23.876
He told me to stall making
the bomb to give him time,

27:23.976 --> 27:25.778
but then the deadline
was moved up.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.614
I went to him upset,
begged him to hurry.

27:28.715 --> 27:30.783
Then I heard he was killed.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.252
I know his blood
is on my hands.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.421
But we were trying to save Asal.

27:35.521 --> 27:36.889
Please,

27:36.989 --> 27:38.758
you have to help her
before they discover

27:38.858 --> 27:40.492
the bomb doesn't work.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.864
<i>Mateen didn't kill Huxley.</i>

27:44.964 --> 27:46.933
His alibi checks out. He
was working an extra shift

27:47.033 --> 27:48.735
that night at the grocery store.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.569
He's also telling the truth
about those unknown texts.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.004
We traced them
to a burner phone.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.473
Yeah. A burner
that sent him these.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.343
This has got to be
his fianc√©e, Asal.

27:57.443 --> 27:58.878
Metadata on
the photos

27:58.978 --> 28:00.646
confirms that they
were taken in Turkey.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.114
So Mateen was forced
to build that bomb,

28:02.214 --> 28:03.249
but we don't know by who.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.917
Or what they want to use it for.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.586
The people behind this have a
long reach to Asal in that camp.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.255
Maybe we can find
the connection?

28:09.355 --> 28:10.990
Except they're good
at covering their tracks.

28:11.090 --> 28:14.226
I couldn't pull a single print
off any of the shell casings

28:14.326 --> 28:15.795
collected at the auto shop.

28:15.895 --> 28:18.264
And no hits yet on the getaway
van they were driving.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.734
Wait, what if one of the men
that attacked you

28:21.834 --> 28:23.369
at the auto shop killed Huxley

28:23.469 --> 28:24.570
'cause they were getting
too close?

28:24.670 --> 28:25.838
If they did,
they had access

28:25.938 --> 28:27.306
to Promises Honored.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.607
They took the knife from there.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.876
So we start pulling names.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.944
Every employee,
volunteer, visitor.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.312
We find out who killed Huxley

28:33.412 --> 28:35.314
and we find the men
who took that bomb.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.585
Damn it!

28:40.753 --> 28:42.454
Nick, everything okay?

28:42.554 --> 28:43.655
I'm running out of suspects.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.357
I just cleared another

28:45.457 --> 28:46.893
Promises Honored volunteer.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.560
You need to take a break.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.429
Why?
I know this hits close to home.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.298
You know, people
come to this country

28:52.398 --> 28:53.365
because they're desperate.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.566
Yeah, makes 'em vulnerable,

28:54.666 --> 28:56.302
which makes 'em
an easy target.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.536
My mom was one of 'em.

28:57.636 --> 28:58.905
Must have pissed you off.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.039
Yeah.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.674
Now I'm pissed off for Mateen.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.043
Just got off the phone with DHS.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.878
It turns out
the permanent refugee status

29:05.978 --> 29:08.747
of Mateen's fianc√©e
was approved months ago.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.549
Then why hasn't
Asal been transferred

29:10.649 --> 29:12.051
from that Turkish camp?

29:12.151 --> 29:13.652
Because the aid organization
that was supposed to

29:13.752 --> 29:16.622
relocate her here
has been holding things up.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.024
Promises Honored?

29:18.124 --> 29:19.959
Pastor Eddie's office
has yet to approve

29:20.059 --> 29:21.660
Asal's assistance package.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.829
Why?
I don't know.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.096
But if our boy Eddie

29:24.196 --> 29:25.397
is somehow mixed up
in this mess,

29:25.497 --> 29:27.099
then we need to find him, quick.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.667
Let's roll.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.539
McGee just pinged
Eddie's cell phone.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.074
He's here.

29:35.174 --> 29:36.242
That's his car.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.644
Looks like he's sitting in it.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.987
NCIS!

29:48.087 --> 29:49.922
Show me your
hands, Eddie!

30:00.632 --> 30:02.134
No weapon.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.836
It's not a suicide.
Another guy

30:03.936 --> 30:05.404
in Mateen's circle
gets murdered.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.605
Can't be a coincidence.

30:06.705 --> 30:07.907
But doesn't get
us any closer

30:08.007 --> 30:09.741
to whoever killed them. No.

30:10.542 --> 30:11.710
But this might.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.345
I wouldn't hold my breath
for prints.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.047
Or maybe Kasie gets lucky.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.417
Guess I should have
held my breath.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.119
You can thank Kasie later.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.121
Partial print that she
pulled from that shell

30:22.221 --> 30:24.523
is a 90% probable
match for

30:24.623 --> 30:25.657
this charmer.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.193
Robert Whitlock, 55.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.996
Head of a Maryland-based
white nationalist militia

30:30.096 --> 30:31.563
known as Last Liberty.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.332
They're flagged as an extremist

30:33.432 --> 30:34.733
organization
by the FBI.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.135
Allegedly connected to multiple

30:36.235 --> 30:38.337
hate crime-related homicides.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.339
And recent intel says
that the militia

30:40.439 --> 30:42.975
is seeking out explosives
to further their cause.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.310
McGEE:
Is it possible

30:44.410 --> 30:46.745
that Whitlock teamed up
with Pastor Eddie

30:46.845 --> 30:48.514
to find someone
to make the bomb?

30:48.614 --> 30:49.916
Maybe that's why
the pastor held up

30:50.016 --> 30:51.483
Asal's transfer.
Mateen makes

30:51.583 --> 30:54.453
the bomb for them and then
Whitlock kills the pastor?

30:54.553 --> 30:55.888
Tying up any loose ends.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.323
His manifesto is filled
with violent threats

30:57.423 --> 31:00.792
to purge America
of foreigners and nonbelievers.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.294
Well, setting off a bomb
made by a foreigner--

31:02.394 --> 31:04.096
that's one way
to start that purge.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.464
Mateen says the bomb's a dud.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.766
Yeah, well,
let's not take any chances.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.169
We need to stop
these guys now.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.238
Gravity! Use gravity
to your advantage!

31:12.338 --> 31:14.540
There you go! There you go!
That is right!

31:14.640 --> 31:16.475
Use your elbow!
Use your elbow!

31:16.575 --> 31:18.110
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
On the ground.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.346
That's it.
Up, up, up, up, up!

31:20.446 --> 31:22.081
We are not weak!

31:27.486 --> 31:28.587
Federal agents!

31:29.455 --> 31:32.224
Put your weapons down
and your hands in the air!

31:32.324 --> 31:33.459
Cops, cops, cops!

31:33.559 --> 31:35.027
Pull back! Pull back!

31:35.127 --> 31:36.462
Fence,

31:36.562 --> 31:37.629
fence, fence, fence!

31:37.729 --> 31:38.864
Pull back!

31:40.866 --> 31:42.834
Got eyes on the bomb.
It's in the van.

31:45.271 --> 31:47.206
We can't return fire
with that bomb right there.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.575
You're surrounded, Whitlock!
There's no way out!

31:49.675 --> 31:51.810
We're not going down
without a fight!

31:51.910 --> 31:53.279
No surrender!

32:21.340 --> 32:23.175
Bomb squad's
still clearing the area

32:23.275 --> 32:24.977
to make sure
there's no other explosives.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.178
What about Whitlock and his men?

32:26.278 --> 32:27.546
Explosion took 'em all out.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.914
Which doesn't make any sense,
given that

32:29.015 --> 32:30.649
Mateen said
the bomb wasn't functional.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.851
We need Kasie to find out
why that bomb exploded.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.054
I think I may know
someone who can help.

32:37.923 --> 32:41.193
We're offering you the chance
to redeem yourself, Mateen.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.995
Private Huxley
deserves justice.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.930
I will do anything
to make this right.

32:45.031 --> 32:45.897
Kasie,

32:45.998 --> 32:47.033
this is

32:47.133 --> 32:48.500
Mateen Jamaah. Ah.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.237
And this is your baby
after it went boom.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.471
That's impossible.

32:52.571 --> 32:53.839
Well, half a dozen

32:53.939 --> 32:55.841
dead white nationalists
would disagree.

32:55.941 --> 32:58.044
I can spend hours sorting
through this myself,

32:58.144 --> 33:02.648
or you can quickly tell me
why your fail-safe failed.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.620
Here it is.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.889
The remote detonator receiver.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.493
It's been repaired.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.662
I cut these wires,

33:16.762 --> 33:19.198
but they've been reconnected
to the circuit board.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.732
The militia must
have figured out

33:20.832 --> 33:23.069
the bomb was deactivated
and fixed it.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.470
Okay, and then what--

33:24.570 --> 33:26.172
they just accidentally
blew themselves up?

33:26.272 --> 33:27.439
Setting off
this bomb

33:27.539 --> 33:29.308
would still require
a remote trigger.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.778
And no trigger was taken
into evidence from that camp.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.847
Okay, so if the bomb
wasn't set off by the militia,

33:35.947 --> 33:36.982
then who did?

33:37.716 --> 33:39.251
<i>Who else knew</i>

33:39.351 --> 33:40.786
about the existence
of that bomb?

33:40.886 --> 33:42.988
We recovered Whitlock's burner
phone from the campsite.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.991
We pulled the SIM card and saw
that he traded plenty of calls

33:46.092 --> 33:48.360
with the Promises
Honored Community Center.
Yeah, with his partner in crime,

33:48.460 --> 33:49.428
Pastor Eddie.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.429
Well, that's what we thought.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.763
But the phone calls began

33:51.863 --> 33:53.532
when Eddie was on an
overseas mission trip.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.866
Well, if Whitlock
wasn't talking to Eddie,

33:54.966 --> 33:56.268
then Eddie wasn't his partner.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.536
Eddie was an innocent scapegoat.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.271
Once we were on
the real partner's trail,

33:59.371 --> 34:00.739
they got spooked.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.874
Killed Eddie with a bullet
that pointed us to Whitlock.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.643
Whitlock and his men were
blown to high hell to make

34:04.743 --> 34:05.977
all of this go away.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.513
Scorched earth.
Eliminate everyone

34:07.613 --> 34:09.448
so there's nobody
left to investigate.

34:09.548 --> 34:10.816
The real partner thought
we would believe

34:10.916 --> 34:12.251
the bomb exploding
was just an accident.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.985
And thanks to Mateen,
now we know it wasn't.

34:14.086 --> 34:17.556
So who was Whitlock talking to
at Promises Honored?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.166
NCIS.

34:27.266 --> 34:30.302
It is so kind of you to join us
for the remembrance celebration

34:30.402 --> 34:31.503
for Pastor Eddie and Bill.

34:31.603 --> 34:32.804
We can't stay long, Ms. Hipple.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.540
Yeah, and neither can you.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.744
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.546
Once we started
looking for connections

34:40.646 --> 34:42.748
between Promises Honored
and the Last Liberty,

34:42.848 --> 34:44.516
didn't take long
for us to discover

34:44.616 --> 34:46.585
that you were
Robert Whitlock's girlfriend.

34:47.419 --> 34:48.687
Whitlock sent you
to this community

34:48.787 --> 34:49.921
to find a fall guy.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.657
And once you found
one in Mateen,

34:51.757 --> 34:53.559
you forced him
to build that bomb.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.429
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Case worker

34:57.529 --> 35:00.065
at the Turkish camp where
Mateen's fianc√©e is being held

35:00.166 --> 35:02.067
confessed to being
bribed by you to hold up

35:02.168 --> 35:04.470
her transfer.
And when
Private Huxley

35:04.570 --> 35:06.838
got onto your plan,
you murdered him.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.844
It was smart of you to point us
toward Mateen as his killer.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.982
Too bad...

35:17.082 --> 35:18.650
we're smarter.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.323
It's you...

35:24.423 --> 35:25.857
and everyone here

35:25.957 --> 35:28.727
that's destroying
this once-great nation.

35:29.761 --> 35:33.799
No, it's me and everyone here--

35:33.899 --> 35:36.668
we help make it great.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.115
<i>Here's the deal, Austin.</i>

35:50.216 --> 35:53.585
You're a boy,
soon to become a young man,

35:53.685 --> 35:56.655
and with that comes
certain responsibilities,

35:56.755 --> 35:58.424
especially regarding

35:58.524 --> 36:01.693
soon-to-become young women.

36:03.329 --> 36:05.497
Ooh.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.099
Okay.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.435
We're done.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.102
That's enough.

36:12.471 --> 36:13.739
How do you feel?

36:13.839 --> 36:15.774
Did you get it all out?
Did you-did you just...

36:15.874 --> 36:17.376
Yeah, well, obviously,
I'm not gonna do that

36:17.476 --> 36:18.710
with a scalpel in my hand.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.011
Right.
But, yeah,

36:20.111 --> 36:21.513
I feel pretty good about it,
you know?

36:21.613 --> 36:22.848
Good. Good.
Yeah. I think I'm gonna

36:22.948 --> 36:24.049
call Austin's parents

36:24.149 --> 36:26.952
Nope. Okay, no.
and set up a tour.

36:31.089 --> 36:34.125
So, listen, uh...
You're right.

36:35.126 --> 36:38.230
I will never be
the father of a daughter.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.834
So you're not gonna
hear it from me.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.936
But I'm hoping you will hear it

36:45.036 --> 36:47.606
from someone who is a father.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.713
Dr. Palmer,
let's have a little chat.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.557
Austin and his family will not

37:05.657 --> 37:08.827
be touring NCIS anytime soon.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.430
Director Vance...
I talk,

37:11.530 --> 37:12.864
you listen.

37:14.433 --> 37:18.304
From the moment you first cradle
your daughter in your arms,

37:18.404 --> 37:20.639
it is your lifelong job
to protect her.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.874
Exactly. And that is why I...

37:27.546 --> 37:29.681
Part of that protection

37:29.781 --> 37:33.051
is accepting the natural order
of things.

37:33.151 --> 37:34.586
They grow up.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.722
You need to trust

37:36.822 --> 37:39.491
that you have given her
all the tools she needs

37:39.591 --> 37:42.628
to start protecting herself.

37:45.564 --> 37:46.965
Yeah.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.569
It's just...

37:50.669 --> 37:52.804
it is scary

37:52.904 --> 37:56.875
trusting that I have actually
done my job as a parent.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.712
Director, when it comes
to Victoria...

38:00.812 --> 38:02.080
Yeah.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.350
It's understandable.
Life has

38:04.450 --> 38:07.118
thrown a whole lot at you
these last few years.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.722
But you've been through
a lot, too.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.190
I can't imagine

38:12.290 --> 38:14.660
you doing anything
this foolish with Kayla.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.363
Oh, every father is tempted.

38:18.964 --> 38:21.933
When, uh, Kayla's prom date
came to pick her up,

38:22.033 --> 38:24.936
I debated having him
meet me in the kitchen

38:25.036 --> 38:27.606
where I was gonna be
cleaning my service pistol.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.641
Well...

38:29.741 --> 38:32.544
Puts my scalpel
to shame.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.481
And you know what? All I would
have done was embarrass myself.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.982
And I would have
embarrassed Kayla

38:37.082 --> 38:39.150
on the night that was
supposed to be about her.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.387
Hmm.

38:42.721 --> 38:45.891
We have to let them live
their own lives, Doc.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.803
We need to have
the kitchen prepped by 12:00

38:57.903 --> 39:00.439
for the children's
cooking class.
Of course.

39:00.539 --> 39:01.773
We heard that

39:01.873 --> 39:04.142
this place found a new director. Yes,

39:04.242 --> 39:06.144
I was surprised when
the Promises Honored board

39:06.244 --> 39:08.714
asked me to fill
such an important position.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.116
We're not. It's clear
everybody here looks up to you.

39:11.216 --> 39:12.951
You need volunteers?
You can put us to work.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.319
We appreciate that.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.622
My, uh, kids baked
some cookies to share.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.690
70% dark chocolate chip?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.125
Well, nothing like
what Private Huxley

39:20.225 --> 39:22.227
would have whipped up,
I'm sure, but I, uh,

39:22.327 --> 39:25.030
I have snuck a few and I can
confirm they are very tasty.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.898
I'll be happy to pass them out.

39:26.998 --> 39:29.535
I do have plenty
of probation hours to work off.

39:29.635 --> 39:30.769
Thank you for arranging things

39:30.869 --> 39:32.203
so I could serve them
with my community.

39:32.303 --> 39:34.706
We're also here to share
some news about Asal.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.808
She boarded a plane
about an hour ago.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.343
She should be here with you
by the morning.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.383
Thank you.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.223
Come. Come with me
to visit my friends.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.198
Is your head healing,
Agent Torres?

40:00.298 --> 40:02.233
It's Nick.

40:02.333 --> 40:06.404
And, um, it's healing
just fine, because of you.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.076
I'm sorry.

40:12.778 --> 40:15.246
For everything
you've all suffered.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.483
Thank you.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.817
Especially because
you know what it's like

40:18.917 --> 40:20.686
to leave everything behind.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.087
Hardly. Um...

40:22.187 --> 40:24.556
My journey to get here was...

40:26.257 --> 40:29.260
It was different.
But you still experienced loss.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.697
You felt pain
for those left behind.

40:31.797 --> 40:35.834
It helps to remind myself
that those who can't be with us,

40:35.934 --> 40:39.104
they want us to move forward.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.940
Building new lives
is how we honor the sacrifice

40:42.040 --> 40:44.309
of everyone who got us here.

40:47.646 --> 40:51.049
Well, I've had to, uh,
build many new lives before.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.451
And how is this one going?

40:55.654 --> 40:57.255
Best one yet.

40:58.524 --> 41:01.259
Then cherish those
who helped you build it.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.432
You are always
welcome in this home...

41:10.235 --> 41:12.270
...Nick.
