"The Mentalist.."

00:04.352 --> 00:05.657
You know what Red John's
trying to do, don't you?

00:05.744 --> 00:07.398
He asked me
if I'm ready to quit.

00:07.485 --> 00:10.140
- How does Jane seem to you?
- I think he's in trouble.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.924
You tortured the guy,
for Christ sakes.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.927
I gave an evil psychopath
justice.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.668
I'm not gonna apologize.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.757
You're fired.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.324
Get outta here right now.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.413
Don't do anything rash.
We can work this out.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.763
We'll fix it.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.113
Idoubt that.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.029
Let me help you.

00:31.074 --> 00:33.990
[instrumental music]

00:44.087 --> 00:47.003
[music continues]

00:58.232 --> 00:59.407
Hey, Sammy.

00:59.494 --> 01:00.886
Hey.

01:00.973 --> 01:04.586
- Thank you.
- There you go.

01:09.634 --> 01:10.766
[glass clatters]

01:12.811 --> 01:13.986
[exhales sharply]

01:18.861 --> 01:20.993
Magic, huh?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.125
"Magic?"

01:22.212 --> 01:23.561
Tough business.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.520
Yeah. No,
uh, I'm-I'm..

01:25.607 --> 01:26.912
...I'm not
a magician, no.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.132
- No?
- No.

01:29.219 --> 01:32.048
You do coin tricks
and you have the look.

01:32.135 --> 01:34.137
What is the look?

01:34.224 --> 01:36.444
Like you're hiding stuff.

01:36.531 --> 01:37.923
I've seen you around..

01:38.010 --> 01:39.751
Served you drinks
a couple times.

01:39.838 --> 01:40.883
Yeah, I remember.

01:40.970 --> 01:43.320
Uh, Lorelei, right?

01:43.407 --> 01:44.756
How you doing?
I'm-I'm Patrick.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.062
Hey, Patrick.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.543
So you're not a magician?

01:48.630 --> 01:50.414
No. No,
I'm a con man.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.938
I steal from people.

01:53.025 --> 01:55.506
Ah, wow!

01:55.593 --> 01:57.465
You just come
right out and say it.

01:57.552 --> 02:00.468
"I steal from people"
like, "I sell shoes"

02:00.555 --> 02:01.599
like, it's not
a big deal.

02:01.686 --> 02:02.818
Well, it's not
a big deal.

02:02.905 --> 02:03.819
If you know
what you're doing

02:03.906 --> 02:05.821
it's very easy.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.649
Well, it's a big deal
because it's wrong

02:07.736 --> 02:09.868
to steal from people.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.566
No such thing as wrong.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.742
Really?
When did that happen?

02:13.829 --> 02:17.006
Well, there's
legal or illegal.

02:17.093 --> 02:20.052
There's, uh...happy or sad.

02:20.140 --> 02:24.100
Rich or poor,
alive or...dead.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.407
But there's
no wrong or right.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.800
Stuff just happens,
that's all.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.324
One damn thing
after another.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.500
Of course,there's wrong or right.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.633
You know that.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.246
I killed a man last year.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.465
Turns out he wasn't
the man I wanted to kill.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.989
Wrong guy. Anyway..

02:44.076 --> 02:45.295
..now when I recall

02:45.382 --> 02:48.385
shooting him dead..

02:48.472 --> 02:51.127
...still feels good.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.782
It's a happy
little memory to cherish..

02:53.869 --> 02:56.045
...like Christmas.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.961
Now you're just trying
to shock me, aren't you?

02:59.048 --> 03:00.832
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.573
You seem
like a happy soul, Lorelei.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.141
- You happy?
- Yes. I am.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.143
- Well, that's nice.
- Mm-hmm.

03:07.230 --> 03:10.015
What's your secret?

03:10.102 --> 03:13.715
- Faith.
- Oh...yes.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.282
Yes, I've heard that.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.892
[chuckles]

03:16.979 --> 03:19.634
Patrick.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.506
This is nice.

03:22.593 --> 03:23.855
Been looking for you.
How you doing?

03:23.942 --> 03:24.943
Everything okay?

03:25.030 --> 03:26.031
Well, how you doing, Oscar?

03:26.118 --> 03:27.163
I'm good.
How you doing?

03:27.250 --> 03:29.121
Good. This is,
um, Lorelei.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.472
Lorelei? What are
you guys drinking?

03:31.559 --> 03:33.343
Uh, same again
for my friends here.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.738
Cognac for me.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.914
This is an amazing man
right here.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.002
Mm.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.003
This man can reach beyond

03:41.090 --> 03:42.265
the veil of death.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.485
- Did you know that?
- Uh, no.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.487
No, we-we just met, really.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.140
You ever lose someone?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.055
I lost my mother
when I was five.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.057
[clears throat]

03:52.144 --> 03:53.885
But this man..

03:53.972 --> 03:55.844
...he let me
talk to her.

03:55.931 --> 03:58.716
And I truly felt
her presence.

03:58.803 --> 03:59.935
She said
she loves me.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.503
She's always
watching over me.

04:02.590 --> 04:03.678
Wow.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.419
Well, it's both a gift..

04:05.506 --> 04:06.550
...and a curse.

04:06.637 --> 04:07.856
Yeah, well..

04:07.943 --> 04:09.466
[slurps]

04:09.553 --> 04:11.860
...I told my father
all about you.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.210
[Oscar]
'About, uh, what an awesome'

04:14.297 --> 04:15.733
'spiritual experience it was.'

04:15.820 --> 04:16.952
Mm-hmm.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.606
Best ten grand
I ever spent.

04:18.693 --> 04:20.172
My father,
he's a tight bastard.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.436
He says, "ten grand?

04:22.523 --> 04:23.872
"Screw that bitch.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.700
Go get your money back."

04:25.787 --> 04:27.832
Turns out
my mother's not dead.

04:27.919 --> 04:30.226
She ran off with
her aerobics instructor.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.620
She lives
in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.536
'Owns a nail salon.'

04:35.623 --> 04:36.580
That explains why she was

04:36.667 --> 04:38.365
so easy to contact, I guess.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.236
[chuckles]

04:40.323 --> 04:42.151
[laughs]

04:42.238 --> 04:43.979
That's good
you can smile about this.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.068
- Here's the thing--
- 'I'm gonna be forgiving.'

04:46.155 --> 04:47.678
Give me my money back..

04:47.765 --> 04:49.419
...and, uh, Mervin
here is gonna tune you up

04:49.506 --> 04:51.943
a little, that's all.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.336
You, uh..

04:53.423 --> 04:55.077
...you mind if I, um..

04:55.164 --> 04:56.774
Give me
my money back.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.821
Yeah, um, can I?
Pass a light. Thanks.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.214
Um, I don't have it.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.478
I spent it all.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.349
Okay.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.437
Well, Mervin's
gonna break

05:07.524 --> 05:09.700
your arms
and the legs..

05:09.787 --> 05:12.181
...and then when
you're walking again..

05:12.268 --> 05:15.924
...you'll owe me 50 grand.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.407
- Ah!
- C'mon, let me.

05:20.494 --> 05:21.451
I got it,
I got it, I got it.

05:21.538 --> 05:24.062
Go get him.

05:24.149 --> 05:27.065

[car horn honks]

05:46.215 --> 05:49.131

05:52.352 --> 05:53.918
There he is.

05:54.005 --> 05:56.878
[music continues]

05:58.488 --> 06:00.882
[foot steps]

06:08.106 --> 06:09.281
Ah!

06:11.371 --> 06:12.502
[giggles]

06:14.896 --> 06:18.726
[Oscar]
'Where you going?'

'Merv!'

06:25.602 --> 06:27.343
[man #2]
Police, hold it
right there!

06:27.430 --> 06:28.388
Alright, alright.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.390
Stay where you are.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.740
[man #3]
'Oscar stay. Don't move.'

06:32.827 --> 06:34.350
You all right?

06:34.437 --> 06:36.047
[grunting]

06:36.134 --> 06:38.528

06:54.936 --> 06:56.024
[Rigsby]
So Benjamin does this thing now

06:56.111 --> 06:57.068
where he kinda
scoots forward

06:57.155 --> 06:58.418
on his butt
like a penguin.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.202
- It's so cute, it's insane.
- Yeah.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.247
Oh, wait. I got a clip on my
phone. Let me find it for you.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.727
- Hey, T.
- Hey, Pat.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.599
[Pat]
How you doin'? Guys.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.035
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.254
[Lisbon]
Oh, God.
What did that?

07:09.341 --> 07:11.866
Shotgun, from about
six inches away.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.563
John Doe all the way.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.478
No wallet, no tattoos

07:15.565 --> 07:17.349
no jewelry, no face.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.481
There's a lot of blood.

07:18.568 --> 07:19.787
He must've been killed
right here.

07:19.874 --> 07:21.353
Robbery?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.617
Well, there's
no foot traffic.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.315
Nothing but offices
around here. It's dead at night.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.186
Well, he must've arrived here
in some kind of vehicle.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.885
There's an interstate ramp
a block away from here.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.930
Our friend could've
come from Oregon.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.497
Give us 20 minutes with him,
and you can bag him.

07:34.584 --> 07:35.846
No hurry.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.196
Hey...sorry about
Jane, by the way.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.241
That's too bad.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.285
Too bad about what?

07:40.372 --> 07:42.679
That he got arrested.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.464
I heard it from
some guys in vice.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.988
He got busted
for assault, fraud..

07:47.075 --> 07:49.164
...narcotics
and resisting arrest..

07:49.251 --> 07:50.382
...in Vegas.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.558
That's terrible.

07:51.645 --> 07:52.907
We should do something.

07:52.994 --> 07:55.213
- Like what?
- I don't know.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.911
Try and talk
to him, I guess.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.347
See if he needs help.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.566
It's been six months
since he left.

07:59.653 --> 08:00.610
Maybe he's changed.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.177
- No.
- 'But--'

08:02.264 --> 08:04.048
I offered him
all the help in the world

08:04.135 --> 08:06.268
and he turned me
down many times.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.878
He has to want to change.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.358
He has to hit
bottom and know it.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.403
That's recovery
101, right?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.448
I guess.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.493
Well, maybe this is bottom.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.798
It's pretty low, boss.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.365
When he wants help,
he'll ask us.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.410
He knows where we are.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.369
- Hey, Pat. Good seeing you.
- You too.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.327
Get our John Doe
here on ice quick.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.851
I think he's gonna be
around for a while.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.070
[Pat]
'Alright, see you.'

08:26.157 --> 08:29.030

08:31.815 --> 08:33.251
[keys jangling]

08:39.301 --> 08:40.868
[door lock buzzing]

08:42.217 --> 08:44.088
- Sign that.
- Um.

08:44.175 --> 08:45.873
Ah.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.049
Uh, wh-why am I
being released?

08:48.136 --> 08:49.485
I didn't raise bail.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.356
Somebody raised it for you.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.402
Who was that?

08:53.489 --> 08:55.491
I don't have
that information.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.275
Teresa Lisbon is my guess.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.842
Huh? Lisbon?

08:58.929 --> 09:01.018
I don't have
that information.

09:01.105 --> 09:02.716
Okay. You don't have
that information.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.935
You can keep that.
Thank you.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.154

09:07.851 --> 09:13.335

Boss.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.394
Good news, bad news.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.396
Bad news,
our John Doe's prints

10:14.483 --> 10:16.659
didn't get a match,
so we still have no ID.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.008
Of course.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.793
Good news, Sac PD
caught a homicide

10:19.880 --> 10:21.533
on Pacoima and third
last night.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.535
Suspect got away,
but they have an eyewitness

10:23.623 --> 10:25.494
and they recovered
the murder weapon.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.235
A sawed-off shotgun.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.106
Ejected cartridge was
the same make as ours

10:29.193 --> 10:30.586
and Pacoima and third
is only ten blocks

10:30.673 --> 10:31.805
from our murder scene.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.763
That's news,
good news would be

10:33.850 --> 10:35.504
better than that.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.201
- It's a lead.
- You're right.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.463
Sac PD, you said?

10:38.550 --> 10:40.161
Uh, who's the detective
on that?

10:40.248 --> 10:43.077
Not sure. Somebody on
Captain Rupert's night shift.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.339
You're right,
It's a good lead

10:44.426 --> 10:45.775
and I need to get
out of here.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.778
Let's go down in person
and see what they have.

10:51.999 --> 10:52.956
[knock on door]

10:53.043 --> 10:55.916
[instrumental music]

11:02.574 --> 11:03.706
Mm.

11:07.318 --> 11:08.624
Hey.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.452
Hey.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.149
Surprise.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.369
Yeah.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.501
Lorrie, right?

11:16.588 --> 11:18.068
Lorelei.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.896
Sorry.
This was a mistake.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.463
No, no, no. Lorelei.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.986
I'm very happy
to see you.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.901
Just, uh, been
a little slow today.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.860
It's...it's been
a rough week.

11:26.947 --> 11:29.993
Yeah, I can imagine.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.866
I...brought you
some chicken soup.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.519
For me?

11:34.606 --> 11:36.130
Yeah.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.654
Come in.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.745
Excuse the mess.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.921
How did you know
my address?

11:45.008 --> 11:48.446
The bail bondsman
gave it to me.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.187
How did you know
who the bail bondsman was?

11:50.274 --> 11:51.362
[chuckles]

11:51.449 --> 11:52.929
What are you,
Columbo here

11:53.016 --> 11:54.278
with the third degree?

11:54.365 --> 11:58.326
I'm sorry.
Just a little curious.

11:58.413 --> 12:02.199
I knew who he was,
because...I was the one

12:02.286 --> 12:04.941
that put up the money
for your bail.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.465
That's a lot of money.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.511
I'll-I'll pay you back
as soon as I can.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.383
Figured you were
good for it.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.602
Why'd you
do that for me?

12:13.689 --> 12:15.343
[inhales deeply]

12:15.430 --> 12:18.433
You seemed like
a good man who lost his way.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.392
I could help,
so I did.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.829
And at this point

12:22.916 --> 12:26.658
a straight up
"thank you" would be okay.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.836
Thank you.

12:29.923 --> 12:34.231
There's, uh...a lot
of good men out there..

12:34.318 --> 12:37.060
...who have lost their way.

12:37.147 --> 12:38.670
Wow. You're gonna
make me say it out loud?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.063
[chuckles]

12:40.150 --> 12:43.806
I felt like
we got along pretty good.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.503
I felt like
there was some kind of..

12:45.590 --> 12:46.940
[gasps]

12:47.027 --> 12:48.550
...weird connection
there between us.

12:48.637 --> 12:52.075
I trusted my feelings.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.906
Damn it. Was I wrong?

12:57.907 --> 13:00.344
No.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.259
You weren't wrong.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.826
Okay then.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.610
I have to
warn you, Lorelei.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.787
Um, I'm not
the great catch

13:07.874 --> 13:11.355
you might think
I am from..

13:11.442 --> 13:14.141
...first impressions.

13:15.707 --> 13:16.752
That's okay.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.711
Neither am I.

13:22.845 --> 13:26.022
Bean, tell these people
what you saw.

13:26.109 --> 13:27.676
I'm collecting
cans on third.

13:27.763 --> 13:30.200
Right next to the park
where they sell their drugs.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.028
There's a gunshot. Boom!

13:32.115 --> 13:33.943
Then a tall,
young, Latin gentleman

13:34.030 --> 13:35.162
come running
out of the park

13:35.249 --> 13:37.425
holding
a sawed-off shotgun.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.122
He trips and falls over.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.907
[chuckles]
Drops the gun.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.431
Then he gets up
and runs away..

13:43.518 --> 13:45.912
...leaves the gun,
and that's what I saw.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.827
The tall, young,
Latin gentleman..

13:47.914 --> 13:49.393
...did you get
a good look at him?

13:49.480 --> 13:50.917
Come right by me.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.919
Got a scar
on his face right here.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.616
- Little chin beard.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.703 --> 13:57.140
Big gold earring
like a pirate.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.621
Black t-shirt, jeans..

13:59.708 --> 14:01.144
...white shoes.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.017
Anything on the t-shirt?
Logo? Numbers?

14:04.104 --> 14:05.801
- Don't think so.
- Thanks, Bean.

14:05.888 --> 14:09.718
Wait. Close your eyes
and picture him.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.592
Now imagine
him coming toward you.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.290
Oh!

14:16.377 --> 14:19.380
There's a little dog
right here on his shirt.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.990
Not a cute dog.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.035
Like, you know

14:22.122 --> 14:23.906
a snarling dog.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.734
Like a bulldog or a wolf?

14:25.821 --> 14:27.214
Wolf!

14:27.301 --> 14:28.911
Grape Street lobos
wear black shirts

14:28.998 --> 14:30.173
with a wolf on 'em.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.262
- Thank you, Miss Bean.
- Mm-hmm.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.482
Yeah, so it's kind
of thin but my guys

14:34.569 --> 14:36.701
will check out the lobos
and we'll let you know.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.442
[Van Pelt]
Well, we can check 'em out
for you, if you'd like.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.009
CBI gang unit has
a really good database.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.228
That's okay, girls.

14:41.315 --> 14:42.272
Thanks, but we
don't even know

14:42.359 --> 14:43.317
if it's the same
gun as yours.

14:43.404 --> 14:44.666
It probably isn't.

14:44.753 --> 14:45.972
Yeah, okay, Rupe.
It was good seeing you.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.190
Yeah.

14:48.626 --> 14:49.714
Talk to the gang unit.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.325
See what they know
about the lobos.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.674
Okay.

14:52.761 --> 14:53.936
I'm gonna take
some personal time.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.895
You take the car.
I'm gonna walk.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.026
Walk?

14:57.113 --> 14:59.246
I mean...okay.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.248
See you.

15:02.423 --> 15:05.295

[sizzling]

16:12.667 --> 16:15.539
[instrumental music]

16:23.199 --> 16:25.636
Good morning.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.987
[chuckles]

16:28.074 --> 16:31.991
Good morning,
sleepy lover.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.430
Mm.

16:36.517 --> 16:39.346
You must have
slept 12 hours.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.695
Yeah, I think I was tired.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.479
Mm-hmm.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.351
I gotta go to work.

16:44.438 --> 16:45.874
I made some eggs.

16:45.961 --> 16:50.574
How did you know
I love eggs?

16:50.661 --> 16:53.142
[sniffles]

16:53.229 --> 16:57.538
This is delicious.
Thank you.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.974
We had fun, huh?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.193
Yeah.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.676
Perhaps we can see
each other again.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.678
That's not up to me.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.463
Oh, you have no say in it?

17:09.550 --> 17:11.465
None at all.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.728
He's very restful.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.730
I don't follow you.

17:15.817 --> 17:20.387
I do what Red John
tells me to do.

17:20.474 --> 17:21.649
What?

17:23.520 --> 17:24.869
Your freedom..

17:24.956 --> 17:25.914
...our night together.

17:26.001 --> 17:29.135
That was a gift from him.

17:30.571 --> 17:34.053
You can hurt me,
if you'd like.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.533
No, I don't want
to hurt you.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.971
I've given up.
He knows that.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.277
What does
he want from me?

17:41.364 --> 17:44.280
He doesn't want
anything from you.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.152
After all these years..

17:46.239 --> 17:47.849
...he's come
to see you as an..

17:47.936 --> 17:50.982
...old comrade
rather than an enemy.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.333
He hopes you'll come
to feel the same way.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.422
A comrade.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.469
Patrick..

17:59.556 --> 18:01.950
...look at yourself.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.431
You need a new life.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.129
He can give
that to you.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.522
You have to leave.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.654
He's offering
the hand of friendship.

18:10.741 --> 18:13.048
If you refuse him,
he'll be upset.

18:13.135 --> 18:16.965
- Anyone would be.
- Get out.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.929
You know
where to find me.

18:27.367 --> 18:30.239
[instrumental music]

18:39.205 --> 18:41.337
[instrumental music]

18:43.600 --> 18:45.602
Hey, Grace,
you seen Lisbon?

18:45.689 --> 18:47.691
She had to take
some personal time.

18:47.778 --> 18:48.910
Where'd she go?

18:48.997 --> 18:50.216
Didn't say.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.608
We have a lead.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.393
I just got this
from the gang unit.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.135
Kevin Cintron,
aka Purple.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.833
Affiliated with
the Grape Street Lobos.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.661
Matches the witness
description exactly.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.184
Did you show
the witness the photo?

19:02.271 --> 19:03.446
I do that,
and we have to go through

19:03.533 --> 19:04.969
Sac PD Homicide
and they'll wanna

19:05.056 --> 19:06.362
take the bust
and we need the bust.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.755
Must be a thousand bad guys

19:07.842 --> 19:09.452
with gold earrings,
beards and scars.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.324
I got an address
from his PO.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.543
After killing two people that's
probably not where he's at.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.416
It's a good place to start,
though, and I'm going.

19:16.503 --> 19:19.419
You want me to get you
some doughnuts while I'm out?

19:20.942 --> 19:22.117
[bell chiming]

19:23.945 --> 19:26.817

'This is God.'

19:56.673 --> 19:57.979
'What is it now?'

19:58.066 --> 19:59.633
[laughing]

19:59.720 --> 20:00.938
You scared
the life out of me.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.462
[exhales sharply]

20:02.549 --> 20:04.115
I crawled
all the way on my

20:04.203 --> 20:06.770
hands and knees
from that door.

20:06.857 --> 20:09.077
- But it was worth it.
- What are you doing here?

20:09.164 --> 20:10.948
It's good to see you.
How have you been?

20:11.035 --> 20:12.646
Worried sick
is how I've been

20:12.733 --> 20:14.909
and then you pop in here
like some sort of a lunatic

20:14.996 --> 20:16.824
playing games,
asking me how I've been.

20:16.911 --> 20:17.999
- Just--
- Shame on you.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.566
Stay calm, okay?

20:19.653 --> 20:21.263
It's important that
no one sees us together.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.612
[sighs]

20:22.699 --> 20:25.398
Why not?

20:25.485 --> 20:27.791
I'm faking my breakdown.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.924
It's a ruse
to trap Red John.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.753
You son of a bitch.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.972
You...son of a bitch.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.713
Okay, we are in a church.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.107
Uh, wait, so how does
faking a breakdown

20:39.194 --> 20:41.022
if that's what
you're reallydoing

20:41.109 --> 20:42.415
because it looks
pretty real to me

20:42.502 --> 20:44.678
how does that
trap Red John?

20:44.765 --> 20:46.636
What does
Red John want from me?

20:46.723 --> 20:49.813
What did he send
that little girl to ask me?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.163
- Do you give up?
- Exactly, and I do give up.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.383
I quit. I burn
the Red John files.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.167
I freak out
at the boss.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.865
I admit defeat,
and I sink

20:57.952 --> 21:00.737
into a terrible
depression.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.086
Brilliant.
You did that part great.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.262
Now what?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.438
And why doesn't
he just kill me?

21:05.525 --> 21:06.874
Because it's too easy.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.136
He wants to turn me.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.617
He wants to make
me his disciple.

21:10.704 --> 21:14.142
So I admit defeat,
and then he reaches out

21:14.229 --> 21:16.231
to start a conversation.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.841
That's all
supposition.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.582
- He's not gonna--
- He already has reached out.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.803
He sent me
a message.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.109
I need to
start a new life

21:25.196 --> 21:28.417
and he can help me.

21:28.504 --> 21:29.592
Help you?

21:29.679 --> 21:32.160
He wants to help you?

21:32.247 --> 21:33.596
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do?

21:33.683 --> 21:36.730
Well, I'm gonna
take him up on the offer.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.732
I'm in a lot
of real trouble.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.037
I do need
a new life.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.778
Yes, you do.

21:41.865 --> 21:45.086
That's what makes
the gag work.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.435
- Then what?
- Well, I don't know.

21:46.522 --> 21:47.480
I let him lead.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.133
That's the beauty of it.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.396
He thinks I'm the fish

21:50.483 --> 21:51.440
and he's the fisherman.

21:51.527 --> 21:54.443
Unless he sees the truth.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.663
I am giving him
his heart's desire.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.753
He will see
what he wants to see.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.232
Or not.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.973
Fooled you.
I can fool him.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.541
Yeah, you fooled me
all right. Well done.

22:05.628 --> 22:06.629
Yeah.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.501
Well..

22:08.588 --> 22:11.547
...I'm sorry.

22:11.634 --> 22:12.983
I tried calling.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.507
I...tried calling you

22:14.594 --> 22:15.986
hundreds...of times.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.510
Begging you
to talk to me.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.512
Begging you
to get help.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.078
Not a reply.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.123
Not a word.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.734
Not a text.

22:25.605 --> 22:26.736
Sorry.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.390
You know what?

22:28.477 --> 22:29.826
I have not
been sleeping.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.219
I've been...forget it.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.481
Never mind.

22:32.568 --> 22:35.441
You know,
y-you're a jerk.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.966
And your plan?
It's stupid.

22:39.053 --> 22:42.099
It's not even a plan.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.928
But you will help me?

22:45.015 --> 22:47.366
What am I
supposed to say, no?

22:47.453 --> 22:49.933
God, you're despicable.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.109
Take this.
It's clean.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.633
I'll call you on it
when the time comes.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.504
In the meantime,
do not contact me.

22:55.591 --> 22:58.377
Do not let anyone
from CBI contact me.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.988
And don't tell
anyone the truth.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.120
Not a soul.

23:03.207 --> 23:04.948
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me

23:05.035 --> 23:06.472
you were doing this,
that you couldn't trust me

23:06.559 --> 23:07.690
with a secret like that.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.518
We're supposed
to be partners.

23:09.605 --> 23:11.128
God knows,
I am happy you're back.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.434
It is a huge relief.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.262
But what you did..

23:14.349 --> 23:17.787
...frankly, was a betrayal.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.008
God, I hate you, Jane.

23:21.095 --> 23:24.098
I hate you!

23:27.841 --> 23:30.234
We have your prints
on the shotgun, Kevin.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.584
We have an eyewitness
who saw you shoot

23:31.671 --> 23:34.282
Dashawn Willits
with that shotgun.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.326
I'm showing them
the gun because

23:35.414 --> 23:36.763
I'm trying to
sell it to 'em.

23:36.850 --> 23:37.807
Fool tried to take
the gun from me.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.069
I had no other choice.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.419
But the first
shooting, though.

23:40.506 --> 23:41.811
The white John Doe
on Lincoln Avenue.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.596
Did that guy try to
steal your gun, too?

23:43.683 --> 23:45.075
I didn't touch
that man, all right?

23:45.162 --> 23:48.209
He killed himself.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.603
I swear to god.
Me and my boy, Manfreddo

23:50.690 --> 23:52.039
we cruisin' down
the alleyway, we lookin' for

23:52.126 --> 23:54.171

to be honest with you.

23:54.258 --> 23:56.478
I see this guy sittin'
up against the dumpster.

23:56.565 --> 23:59.263
Got a bicycle next to him
and a sawed-off shotgun.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.352
Just as we start
to get close...

24:01.440 --> 24:02.789
Damn if he don't
blow off his head.

24:02.876 --> 24:05.269
Hara-kiri.
No messing around.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.662
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

24:06.749 --> 24:10.361
You don't.
You just know what is.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.276
Come on, man,
you guys ask Manfreddo.

24:12.363 --> 24:15.541
He gonna tell
you the same thing.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.978
Yeah. Man just shot himself.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.023
Boom! Freaked me out.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.808
I wanted the gun,
but Kevin took it.

24:21.895 --> 24:24.114
I got the bike.
Sweet fixie.

24:24.201 --> 24:25.115
Where's the bike,
Manfreddo?

24:25.202 --> 24:27.596
Got stolen.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.991
I know.
Ironic, right?

24:31.078 --> 24:32.601
Did you take
anything else from him?

24:32.688 --> 24:35.952
We looked.
He had nothing on him.

24:36.039 --> 24:38.128
I think he's telling
the truth, Cintron admitted

24:38.215 --> 24:39.913
to the second
killing no problem.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.305
Why would he
lie about this one?

24:41.392 --> 24:43.264
Looks like
we'll never know who he was.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.222
- Poor soul.
- Mm.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.267
Lisbon, a word?

24:46.354 --> 24:48.574
Yeah.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.141
Uh, is that the John Doe
case you're working on?

24:51.228 --> 24:53.361
Yes, sir. It looks
to be a suicide.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.581
Oh, good. Excellent.
Get that off the books, eh?

24:55.668 --> 24:58.540
Um...I wanted
to talk to you about Jane.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.107
It's been six months
since he's gone.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.370
I think it's time
for a little outreach.

25:02.457 --> 25:03.980
Well, it's the humane
thing to do.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.939
He was a big part
of the CBI family, after all.

25:06.026 --> 25:06.983
I suppose, but--

25:07.070 --> 25:08.158
I jus-I...I just wanna

25:08.245 --> 25:09.682
give him a call, see if..

25:09.769 --> 25:11.510
...you know, I can't
persuade him into rehab

25:11.597 --> 25:12.946
or a psychiatry
program or some such.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.077
You know, it could
make a big difference

25:14.164 --> 25:15.470
in his sentencing.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.428
He could get
community service.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.561
He could come back
and work for us eventually.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.651
God knows...we need him.

25:22.738 --> 25:25.175
Closure rates being what
they are right now...low.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.656
Yes, sir, and we will
do our bestto fix that

25:27.743 --> 25:30.006
but I don't think
we can help Jane.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.226
Besides, yeah,
he's made his bed.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.968
I don't...think
I could work with him again.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.666
I need someone
I can rely on.

25:37.753 --> 25:39.059
I'm surprised.

25:39.146 --> 25:40.974
I thought you
would wanna help him.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.411
Well, I do.

25:43.498 --> 25:44.673
It's not how it looks.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.893
I just have a feeling
Jane's better off

25:46.980 --> 25:48.764
left alone right now.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.767
Okay.
It was just a thought.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.428

what you said
about your friend.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.301
Yes.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.520
You said that
he could help me

26:05.607 --> 26:07.740
start a new life.

26:07.827 --> 26:11.352
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

26:11.439 --> 26:14.268
What does
that mean exactly?

26:14.355 --> 26:17.532
A new identity...money.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.708

A job, if you want one.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.581
And I-I do what
in exchange?

26:22.668 --> 26:25.105
Accept his friendship.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.673
- It's that easy?
- Sure.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.153
He-he'll wanna
speak to you first.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.372
Make sure
you're on the level.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.374
If that's all right.

26:33.461 --> 26:34.854
Yeah.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.726
And you'll need
to bring him a gift..

26:37.813 --> 26:40.816
...to show your
respect for him.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.339

Well..

26:44.341 --> 26:45.995

you're not there yet.

30:53.895 --> 30:57.551
2369 Foxglove Parkway..

30:57.638 --> 30:59.727
...Southwest, Las Vegas.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.511
Go there at 3:00 today

31:01.598 --> 31:03.035
and wait for instructions.

31:03.122 --> 31:06.734
2369 Foxglove
Parkway, at 3:00.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.431
Don't forget the gift.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.390
I have it right here.

31:10.477 --> 31:11.652
Don't bring
the whole thing.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.133
Just the head.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.353
Okay.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.313
[inhales deeply]

31:20.400 --> 31:22.881
So you want the good news
or the bad news first?

31:22.968 --> 31:25.144
You lost
two fine agents.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.059
I'm sorry.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.190
Thank you.

31:28.277 --> 31:29.626
I knew Jane
was wrong somehow

31:29.713 --> 31:31.672
but I certainly
never expected this.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.761
Well, nobody did.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.894
We received
no evaluation

31:35.981 --> 31:37.417
that indicated
danger of this sort.

31:37.504 --> 31:39.506
CBI is in no way liable.

31:39.593 --> 31:41.725
Hm.

31:41.812 --> 31:42.901
Well, the question remains.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.990
Why did Jane do this?

31:45.077 --> 31:47.296
Orders from Red John?

31:47.383 --> 31:48.819
If so, why now?

31:48.907 --> 31:50.125
Why Lisbon?

31:50.212 --> 31:51.692
I was talking with Lisbon.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.868
I suggested we...reach out
to try and help Jane

31:53.955 --> 31:56.088
because he was
in trouble and she said "no."

31:56.175 --> 31:57.785
Very firmly.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.743
She said,
"it's not how it looks."

31:59.830 --> 32:01.223
Meaning what?

32:01.310 --> 32:02.529
I don't know.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.271
I don't know
what to think.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.489
[Lisbon]
'Pretty much
the whole neighborhood'

32:06.576 --> 32:07.882
'is in foreclosure.'

32:07.969 --> 32:08.927
'There's hardly anyone there.'

32:09.014 --> 32:10.058
'It's like a ghost town.'

32:10.145 --> 32:11.538
Smart move
by Red John.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.582
Tough to set up
any kind of

32:12.669 --> 32:13.975
'surveillance in advance.'

32:14.062 --> 32:15.455
Any movement's
gonna be conspicuous.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.978
[Rigsby]
He must be suspicious.

32:17.065 --> 32:19.546
No, he's just cautious.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.635
And he's hooked.
He believes.

32:21.722 --> 32:24.029
How can you be sure?

32:24.116 --> 32:27.728
Because he wants
to believe.

32:27.815 --> 32:30.035
We're doing this thing,
so let's just do it.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.559
Is everybody clear on the plan?
We're gonna move soon.

32:32.646 --> 32:33.603
[Rigsby]
'Yeah.'

32:33.690 --> 32:35.475
Hey, you guys, listen..

32:35.562 --> 32:36.737
...I want to apologize

32:36.824 --> 32:37.999
for deceiving you.

32:38.086 --> 32:39.348
Whatever.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.307
And thank you
for...helping me now.

32:41.394 --> 32:43.526
- We're helping the boss.
- Yeah. She's helping you.

32:43.613 --> 32:44.571
We're helping her.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.268
Guys, cut him some slack.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.967
Oh. Yay, team.

33:12.773 --> 33:13.730
[exhales sharply]

33:13.817 --> 33:14.775
No face.

33:14.862 --> 33:15.906
Right.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.473
Could be anybody.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.518
Well, this's
"Rigsby" here.

33:18.605 --> 33:20.999
No mistake.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.655
Do you have
a tape measure?

33:25.742 --> 33:27.179
Sure.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.964
[keypad beeping]

33:30.051 --> 33:32.445
Bill, I need you
to find out ASAP

33:32.532 --> 33:35.622
where Kimball Cho
and Grace Van Pelt are located.

33:35.709 --> 33:36.927
Yeah, right now.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.146
Hold on one second.

33:38.233 --> 33:41.889
Put that
at the top of his head.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.675
5'11".

33:45.762 --> 33:48.461
This isn't Wayne Rigsby.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.985
Yeah. Find out
where they are.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.726
Thanks. And, Bill?

33:52.813 --> 33:54.771
I want arrest warrants
prepped for every single member

33:54.858 --> 33:57.470
of that CBI team,
dead or alive.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.518
[ominous music]

34:12.659 --> 34:15.531
[music continues]

34:27.935 --> 34:30.155
Mm-hm.

34:30.242 --> 34:32.113
The game begins.

34:32.200 --> 34:35.073
[rattling over the radio]

34:37.466 --> 34:40.339

34:43.516 --> 34:44.865
[Patrick over the radio]
'Hey, Lisbon.'

34:44.952 --> 34:46.345
Must have been
a while since you rode on

34:46.432 --> 34:48.390
the handlebars
of a man's bike.

34:48.477 --> 34:49.435
[Lisbon over the radio]
'Ha ha.'

34:49.522 --> 34:51.741
Well, it's kind of romantic.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.569
Wind in your hair.

34:53.656 --> 34:57.225
You're a sick man.

5-0-5-9.

35:00.750 --> 35:04.406
5-0-6-5. 5-0-6..

35:06.060 --> 35:09.803
Uh, there is no 5-0-7-1.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.591
There's nothing.
It's just desert.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.985
There's no one here.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.029
[engine revving distantly]

35:19.117 --> 35:21.031
Hang on.

35:22.555 --> 35:25.123
Long black limousine.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.559
We're moving in,
we'll be on the scene

35:26.646 --> 35:27.647
in three minutes.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.039
Stay healthy till then.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.737
'Wait.'

35:30.824 --> 35:32.695
Let's just be sure.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.436
[car brakes squealing]

'Large man with a gun..'

This is it.'

35:45.447 --> 35:47.841
[dramatic music]

35:47.928 --> 35:49.538
All right,
we're moving in.

[tires squealing]

35:55.065 --> 35:57.807
FBI. Turn off the car
and show me your hands.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.418
FBI! Nobody move!

35:59.505 --> 36:01.594
CBI! Don't shoot!
We're CBI agents!

36:01.681 --> 36:02.812
You're making
a terrible mistake.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.249
- Get out.
- Now!

36:04.336 --> 36:05.641
We're in the middle
of an operation.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.556
Put your hands
on the car.

[FBI agent #1]
'Stay where you are
and don't move.'

36:09.645 --> 36:11.299
Hi.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.692
Hey.

36:12.779 --> 36:15.477
That the gift?

36:15.564 --> 36:17.610
- Red John in there?
- Mm-hmm.

36:17.697 --> 36:21.962
He's looking forward
to speaking with you.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.007
You know, Patrick..

36:24.094 --> 36:25.879
...there's
a childish hopefulness

36:25.966 --> 36:30.797
about you that is
really quite adorable.

36:30.884 --> 36:33.887
Put it on the hood.

36:35.976 --> 36:38.500
So what is it,
a football?

36:38.587 --> 36:40.589
A cabbage?

36:41.721 --> 36:42.809
Melon..

36:42.896 --> 36:44.724
...honeydew.

36:44.811 --> 36:45.986
Organic.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.424
Adorable.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.385
Frisk him,
then beat him..

36:53.472 --> 36:55.865
...a little.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.522
[instrumental music]

37:04.918 --> 37:06.006
Uh!

37:06.093 --> 37:07.921
Well, well, well.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.618
- Agent, this is a mistake.
- Agent, you don't understand.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.838
- No, I don't understand.
- Please listen to me.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.970
[Darcy]
'You're supposed to
be dead, as are you.'

37:14.057 --> 37:15.537
This is very strange.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.322
Susan, I am begging you.

37:17.409 --> 37:20.238
Please listen
to what I'm saying.

37:20.325 --> 37:21.761
Our fake deaths
were a ruse to trap

37:21.848 --> 37:23.415
Red John,
and it worked.

37:23.502 --> 37:24.677
Jane is with
him right now,

37:24.764 --> 37:26.331
and his life
is in grave danger.

37:26.418 --> 37:29.377
He's at 5-0-7-1
Keston Avenue.

37:29.464 --> 37:30.813
Uh-huh.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.641
That's enough.
We haven't got much time.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.643
Put him
in the passenger seat.

37:34.730 --> 37:35.862

'Hello, Patrick.'

37:50.398 --> 37:53.271
[ominous music]

37:59.059 --> 38:01.148
Hey.

38:01.235 --> 38:02.715
How you doing?

38:02.802 --> 38:05.718
Debonair
at all costs, huh?

38:05.805 --> 38:07.633
When did
you know?

38:07.720 --> 38:09.025
'Oh, you strung me along'

38:09.112 --> 38:10.418
'for a good long while.'

38:10.505 --> 38:12.202
'Well done.'

38:12.290 --> 38:14.292
Luckily, I have
a good friend in the FBI.

38:14.379 --> 38:17.991
So, I found out
when the FBI found out.

38:19.166 --> 38:20.602
Cat got
your tongue?

38:20.689 --> 38:22.648
I have
nothing to say.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.345
Really?

38:24.432 --> 38:26.086
Nothing?

38:26.173 --> 38:28.088
Uh, "go to hell"
goes without saying.

38:28.175 --> 38:30.656
So, yes,
nothing.

38:30.743 --> 38:31.918
As you
well know, Patrick.

38:32.005 --> 38:34.964
There is no hell.

38:35.051 --> 38:38.751
When I die,
I won't be punished.

38:38.838 --> 38:42.450
What if you really
did have a change of heart?

38:42.537 --> 38:45.671
What if you
and I were friends?

38:45.758 --> 38:49.414
[Red John]
'Imagine the life
we could lead.'

38:49.501 --> 38:52.895
It's a higher path,
Patrick.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.594
A nobler existence.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.336
Like I said,
"go to hell."

38:58.423 --> 39:00.642
As you wish.

two of his fingers.

'Then we should go.'

Uh!

39:16.571 --> 39:19.269

I'm very happy
to meet you, Lorelei.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.522
We rarely get
the chance to talk

41:21.609 --> 41:24.525
to someone who knows
Red John so well.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.484
Good to meet you, too.

41:26.571 --> 41:29.748
Heard so much about you.

41:32.315 --> 41:35.188
We were lovers,
him and me.

41:35.275 --> 41:38.626
Did he tell you that?

41:38.713 --> 41:41.455
No?

41:41.542 --> 41:43.805
Why not, lover?

41:43.892 --> 41:46.460
[Lorelei]
'You ashamed of me?'

41:46.547 --> 41:50.072
Did we do something bad?

41:50.159 --> 41:51.509
I know it's hard
to believe now

41:51.596 --> 41:54.642
but you're
gonna talk to us.

'You're gonna break down,
and you're gonna tell us'

about Red John.

sing like a bird.

No, lover.

42:03.477 --> 42:05.914
I won't.
