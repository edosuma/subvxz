WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:01.839
 Previously...

00:01.839 --> 00:05.720
 Do you know what it's like going
 through life knowing you're not
 well liked?

00:05.720 --> 00:06.920
 I hate it!

00:06.920 --> 00:10.040
 Maybe the idiots at Boston General
 left something
 in the wound.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.480
 Whenever I use the hand, the nerve's
 irritated, causing pain.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.000
 Isn't it possible
 to free the nerve?

00:16.000 --> 00:16.840
 I'm sorry.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.680
 Whenever you've
 faced defeat,

00:18.680 --> 00:20.840
 you've gotten stronger.

00:20.840 --> 00:21.800
 You're here.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.440
 I changed my mind.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.360
 Dearly beloved, we're
 gathered to join

00:25.360 --> 00:29.360
 John Steinbeck Morrison
 and Joanne McFadden
 in lawful matrimony.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.760
 Clear.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.759
 Let's go again
 after two amps bicarb.

02:09.759 --> 02:10.800
 We gave her
 bicarb.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.840
 Ten minutes ago.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.320
 She's not getting
 adequate coronary
 circulation.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.400
 OK, doctors, what'll it be?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.840
 You call it.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.120
 One amp epi
 on a cardiac needle.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.080
 You're risking
 a pneumothorax.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.600
 Either that or lose
 her. Got a better idea?

02:24.600 --> 02:28.600
 I want to know
 what keeps
 Mrs Hovick humming.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.960
 Her body doesn't have the sense
 to stop.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.240
 How many times
 did she code?

02:37.240 --> 02:39.480
 Every hour
 since midnight.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.400
 My watch should
 be that dependable.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.160
 Give it a shot.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.640
 Hands off.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.440
 Again.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.320
 300 watts.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.400
 Clear.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.760
 Once more. On the bus, lady.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.120
 Ready.

02:56.120 --> 03:00.120
 Clear.

03:00.720 --> 03:01.760
 Normal sinus rhythm.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.760
 Let's get her
 vitals.

03:06.440 --> 03:08.800
 Morning, Mrs Hovick.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.080
 It's going to be
 a scorcher.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.320
 Sounds like
 a great wedding.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.360
 Yeah. But small.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.200
 Registry room,
 city hall.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.120
 Couldn't invite
 more than one.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.720
 Hey, Jack,
 Wayne was the best man

03:22.720 --> 03:24.080
 to be
 the best man.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.640
 Wait till you meet Joanne.
 You are coming to the party?

03:26.640 --> 03:28.200
 Wouldn't miss it
 for the world.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.840
 The kids
 were exhausted last night.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.240
 We put them in bed, watched
 them sleep.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.800
 Married life agrees
 with you, Boomer.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.800
 I'd forgotten how...

03:40.920 --> 03:42.720
 these four days
 with Joanne...

03:42.720 --> 03:45.080
 I'm finally
 settling down,

03:45.080 --> 03:49.080
 getting my life
 normal again.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.400
 Hello. Isn't it
 a gorgeous day?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.480
 Let's go
 to the beach.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.200
 Life's a beach!
 (BUZZER SOUNDS)

03:55.200 --> 03:58.520
 I got it.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.480
 Yeah, on-call.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.080
 Yeah, he's here.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.960
 Fiscus.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.280
 This isn't for me.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.240
 Hello.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.760
 Oh.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.440
 Yeah. Oh...

04:11.440 --> 04:13.080
 Hello.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.760
 Oh. Oh...

04:16.760 --> 04:18.040
 No, I'm...

04:18.040 --> 04:20.800
 Uh...OK.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.840
 I'll be right down.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.800
 They're here,
 Joanne and the kids.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.840
 I assumed they weren't
 coming until the party.

04:29.840 --> 04:33.480
 Assuming makes an ass
 of you and me.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.440
 I've got rounds.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.920
 Give them the 25 cent tour.
 We'll cover.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.080
 Right. Good idea.
 Thanks.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.560
 Help me, guys.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.120
 Please, help me.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.840
 Brown-bagging it,
 Elliot?

04:46.840 --> 04:50.280
 Wayne asked me
 to get this food.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.680
 To kick off
 Boomer's marriage.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.680
 Something special
 happened when they
 took those vows.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.200
 Yeah. Jack strung
 a complete sentence.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.080
 "I do."

05:02.080 --> 05:03.640
 Are you OK?

05:03.640 --> 05:05.840
 Just having
 some yucks, guys.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.400
 See you in ER.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.320
 Not if I
 see you first.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.720
 Elliot...

05:12.720 --> 05:15.360
 Get out.
 I have to change.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.600
 I just got
 to get my lab coat.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.440
 SHE HUMS

05:19.440 --> 05:22.280
 Are you sure
 you're feeling OK?

05:22.280 --> 05:25.680
 Fine. Yesterday,
 Mr Driscoll had a seizure,

05:25.680 --> 05:29.480
 last night,
 a seven-year-old girl died in
 my arms.

05:29.480 --> 05:33.480
 And this morning,
 Robert told me
 he wants a divorce.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.600
 Well, uh...
 have a nice day.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.320
 Yeah.

05:44.320 --> 05:47.680
 You said this heat
 would ease up.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.080
 A low pressure
 system's coming.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.000
 We should have
 thunder showers.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.360
 Tune your radio
 to 590. I do.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.800
 Love the news.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.680
 It's what the electronic
 media does best.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.040
 Falkland invasion, attempted
 assassination on Pope John Paul...

06:03.040 --> 06:05.880
 I feel like I'm there.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.280
 Tell Katharine
 the women's auxiliary

06:08.280 --> 06:10.240
 should hold
 their functions elsewhere.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.600
 What's wrong
 with Bartley House?

06:12.600 --> 06:15.480
 This bill
 for a $200 suite.

06:15.480 --> 06:19.480
 The night of the Doctor of the Year
 banquet, some skirt-chasing
 philanderer signed my name.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.160
 You know about this?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.600
 No, sure don't.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.200
 I'd advise you
 to pay this and next time,
 tear up the carbons.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.200
 Good idea.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.160
 Mark, I've received
 the results of
 Mr Lukas' CT scan.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.320
 His abscess
 is not resolving.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.480
 I'm way ahead
 of you.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.320
 In three hours I'll perform a
 lung resection.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.000
 Operating so soon?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.040
 Tell him, Daniel.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.080
 Dr Sweeney says
 the sensory branch

06:50.080 --> 06:53.920
 of the radial nerve's
 impinged on scar tissue.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.720
 Despite discomfort,
 there's partial mobility.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.400
 It's routine
 surgery.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.000
 What are you
 taking for pain?

07:01.000 --> 07:04.040
 Nothing.
 I can't be doped up while operating.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.440
 I know this is
 drip dry but send this
 to the cleaners

07:06.440 --> 07:08.880
 and lose
 this wrinkle.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.680
 Don't go back to work
 before your hand's
 completely healed.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.720
 It's not a boxing competition.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.520
 Boy, Donald,
 you take the cake.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.880
 Do you think I'd
 rush into surgery

07:18.880 --> 07:21.280
 if I couldn't
 handle it?

07:21.280 --> 07:25.280
 Why do I let you
 do this to me?

07:36.120 --> 07:39.040
 We blew it
 with Mrs Hovick.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.680
 She's alive.
 What are you doing?

07:41.680 --> 07:45.320
 I always order breakfast
 for a patient
 who can't eat. You hungry?

07:45.320 --> 07:46.680
 Cherry Danish?

07:46.680 --> 07:48.080
 Mrs Hovick...

07:48.080 --> 07:50.480
 chronic COPD'er
 with severe pneumonia

07:50.480 --> 07:52.880
 and emphysema,
 anoxic brain damage,

07:52.880 --> 07:54.360
 duodenal ulcer...

07:54.360 --> 07:57.240
 Since she was
 dumped here yesterday,

07:57.240 --> 08:00.080
 we've jump-started
 her eight times.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.480
 We should've
 let her die.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.880
 Playing lacrosse
 at Johns Hopkin's

08:04.880 --> 08:06.840
 developed your
 killer instinct.

08:06.840 --> 08:10.840
 This food's
 not worth stealing.

08:12.920 --> 08:16.920
 How long can we
 keep Mrs Hovick alive?
 Maybe two days tops.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.080
 She's been around since
 McKinley's presidency.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.000
 Even he died better,
 right?

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
 She's got no family or future.
 I want to let her go
 next time she codes.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.680
 Then talk
 to an attending.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.440
 There's
 the ethics
 review board,

08:31.440 --> 08:32.640
 miles of paperwork.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.039
 Try Chandler.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.480
 I will.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.000
 We've been here
 three days.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
 Chandler will wonder
 why we're not making
 these decisions ourselves.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.640
 OK. I'm with you.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.760
 Let Rosenthal
 know, too.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.320
 I'm swinging
 by admissions early
 to pick good cases.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.160
 I grabbed
 the ruptured appy
 and ventral hernia.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.160
 Lose this for me, OK?
 Thanks.

09:02.440 --> 09:06.440
 I was there in '64
 when he sent Liston
 to the canvas.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.600
 In those days,
 it was Cassius Clay.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.480
 None of this
 Mohammed Ali-baba
 business.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.400
 Cliff Eberbach?

09:15.400 --> 09:17.320
 It's Ebb-erbach.
 Yeah, right here.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.200
 You're having
 trouble managing
 your diabetes?

09:20.200 --> 09:24.040
 Do we have to tell
 the whole world?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.480
 Right this way.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.880
 Cubicle one.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.840
 Which is cubicle one?

09:28.840 --> 09:30.240
 Right here.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.240
 Every summer I say
 I'll   read War and Peace.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.440
 Yesterday, on my sailboat,
 I cracked open a new Signet Classic
 edition.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.280
 Next thing, I wake up.
 Hours have passed.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.640
 I look like
 a Maine lobster.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.600
 The drawn butter's
 missing.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.040
 You sunbathe much?

09:47.040 --> 09:50.960
 I will. I bought
 a 30-foot Olson.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.840
 You should
 be careful.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.480
 I rode in
 a bike-a-thon at 18.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.440
 Afterwards,
 I looked 80.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.800
 You have
 a nice touch.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.680
 It hurts so good.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.840
 Stay out
 of the sun.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.440
 Spend my time
 below with
 the bilge pump?

10:09.440 --> 10:13.280
 It would be safer
 with medical
 assistance onboard.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.200
 Would you join me?

10:15.200 --> 10:17.680
 Take along some cream.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.600
 You'd be great
 at splicing
 the main brace.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.000
 You're very nice,
 Mr. Ville...

10:24.000 --> 10:25.440
 Mel. Mel.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.480
 She's married.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.240
 Sorry. I didn't
 see a ring.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.120
 I know I'm married.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.440
 I know what
 taking a vow means.

10:35.440 --> 10:38.360
 Butt out, Wayne.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.800
 Jackie.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.160
 Jackie.

10:43.160 --> 10:45.040
 Give me a hand.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.480
 Joanne.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.400
 Christopher fell off
 the wheelchair ramp.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.240
 My brother is
 such a dork.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.480
 I heard you,
 dork.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.200
 You ARE a dork.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.560
 I know you are
 but what am I?

10:58.560 --> 10:59.600
 A dork!

10:59.600 --> 11:00.840
 But what am I?

11:00.840 --> 11:02.040
 You're a baby.
 Caitlin!

11:02.040 --> 11:05.360
 Why you wear
 that stupid dress?

11:05.360 --> 11:07.480
 You fell down
 a wheelchair ramp.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.280
 Everybody,
 shut up!

11:09.280 --> 11:13.280
 I hate you!

11:24.200 --> 11:26.080
 Thanks for the assist
 this morning.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.480
 Can't work these...
 Here.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.680
 I guess I'm not
 so good at it, either.

11:32.680 --> 11:33.720
 It's OK.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.960
 It's 80 degrees
 already.

11:36.960 --> 11:38.000
 Want some iced tea?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.480
 No, thanks. I stopped by to check
 Mrs Hovick's chart.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.480
 She got her meds.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.960
 It doesn't matter how
 many antibiotics
 we pump into her,

11:48.960 --> 11:51.240
 she's not responding.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.200
 She hurts when we
 stick her with needles.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.440
 You have
 an easier way?

11:55.440 --> 11:59.440
 No, but...

11:59.640 --> 12:00.680
 it's torture.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.680
 In med school,
 we talked about
 the quality of life.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.920
 Am I keeping
 this woman alive

12:08.920 --> 12:11.120
 for heroics' sake?

12:11.120 --> 12:12.880
 After all my years
 as a nurse,

12:12.880 --> 12:14.000
 I told my kids

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
 I didn't want
 artificial means
 keeping me alive.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.240
 You're absolutely right.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.760
 But after
 my brush with cancer,

12:23.760 --> 12:25.880
 I'm going out
 kicking and screaming.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.880
 Only if
 there's a chance
 the pain will end.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.600
 Mrs Hovick
 will never get better.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.840
 We must let her
 die in peace.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.840
 The next time
 she arrests,

12:40.840 --> 12:41.960
 take your time
 responding.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.920
 Doctor, if
 you're asking me
 to no-code her,

12:44.920 --> 12:48.240
 you'll have
 to speak to an attending.

12:48.240 --> 12:52.240
 I can't find
 Dr Swales.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.840
 Is Dr Chandler's
 OK enough?

12:53.840 --> 12:55.800
 Certainly.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.320
 While you're waiting
 for Dr. Swales,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.920
 why not start with
 the paperwork.

13:01.920 --> 13:04.680
 Thanks for your help.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.800
 I mean it.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.040
 First-year residents
 are so polite.

13:09.040 --> 13:13.040
 If only
 it could last.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.560
 How do you like
 Mr Eberbach, 3147?

13:17.560 --> 13:21.440
 Diabetic evaluation?
 Yeah, he's a real charmer.

13:21.440 --> 13:25.440
 Nothing like
 Mrs Blacher
 in 3254, however.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.120
 How's orthopedics
 rotation going?

13:29.120 --> 13:32.560
 Lousy. Took 20 minutes
 to get these X-rays.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.200
 John McEnroe.
 The tennis player?

13:34.200 --> 13:35.800
 I'm not sure.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.520
 He was abusive over
 the phone. Supposed to
 come later.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.520
 We'd better
 serve these up.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.480
 I'll sink
 to the bottom.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.680
 People here
 are trying to rest.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.680
 Philip Chandler,
 meet Caitlin McFadden,

13:56.040 --> 13:57.840
 Christopher McFadden.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.560
 This is
 my wife Joanne,

14:00.560 --> 14:02.560
 and this guy
 you already know.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.080
 Congratulations.
 He's quite a guy.

14:05.080 --> 14:09.080
 It's nice to finally
 put faces with names.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.640
 Dr Craig,
 meet my family.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.520
 This is rounds,
 Morrison,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.000
 not a ticker tape
 parade.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.560
 Heard her odometer's
 been turned back.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.400
 She's divorced?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.720
 So what?

14:21.720 --> 14:23.320
 I prefer the daughter.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.680
 Ehrlich, shut up.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.160
 But first,
 present the next case.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.840
 Mr. Lukas, 67,

14:28.840 --> 14:31.920
 abscess located in the right
 middle lobe of the lung.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.320
 Surgery scheduled for
 later this afternoon.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.680
 Dr Wade and I
 will assist.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.840
 Fabulous.
 Now shut up.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.320
 Guten Morgen.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.360
 Hoffentlich,
 Herr Doktor.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.840
 Wie geht es
 Ihnen heute?

14:45.840 --> 14:49.840
 Beethoven ist krank,
 Einstein hat Kopfschmerzen,

14:50.040 --> 14:54.040
 und mir geht's
 auch schlecht.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.640
 Would you translate
 for the others?

14:57.640 --> 15:01.440
 The doctor asks me
 how am I doing.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.440
 And I said,
 Beethoven is sick, ears,

15:06.680 --> 15:08.360
 Einstein has
 a headache,

15:08.360 --> 15:10.680
 and I don't feel
 so good, either.

15:10.680 --> 15:14.200
 Suppose this guy
 partied with
 those madcaps,

15:14.200 --> 15:15.400
 the Waldheims?

15:15.400 --> 15:19.040
 I love jokes
 that translate,
 Herr Lukas.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.280
 It's inspiring
 that you've retained
 your humour.

15:21.280 --> 15:25.120
 Ich verstehe nicht.
 I don't understand.

15:25.120 --> 15:29.120
 This is Dr Craig's
 first operation

15:29.280 --> 15:32.120
 since cutting
 his hand.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.000
 What?

15:34.000 --> 15:37.840
 Herr Doktor...

15:37.840 --> 15:39.560
 you told me nothing
 about the hand.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.640
 Alles gut...

15:41.640 --> 15:43.400
 English, please.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
 Maybe I can
 explain.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.520
 You've done enough.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.800
 Yeah, well...

15:47.800 --> 15:50.480
 Herr Lukas...

15:50.480 --> 15:52.280
 there's no reason
 for concern.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.440
 I'm the most qualified
 surgeon for this.

15:54.440 --> 15:58.440
 You have my word.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.240
 See you upstairs.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.240
 Let's move on.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.840
 Oh, Dr Craig...

16:11.840 --> 16:14.840
 For Heaven's sake,
 Morrison. Scram.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.800
 Blueprints of an athlete.

16:16.800 --> 16:20.360
 Yet, what makes
 McEnroe phenomenal
 can't be photographed.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.440
 You're sure these
 X-rays are his?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.920
 Only the headband's
 missing.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.840
 He got that fracture
 during a Mac attack.

16:28.840 --> 16:32.440
 US Open, Wimbledon...
 he won them all.

16:32.440 --> 16:36.040
 Why would he come
 to St Eligius?

16:36.040 --> 16:39.520
 Remember when
 Elizabeth Taylor
 was rushed here

16:39.520 --> 16:41.120
 after collapsing
 onstage?

16:41.120 --> 16:42.760
 No.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.520
 Well, it didn't happen,
 but it could have.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.560
 My hand's the same size.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.600
 This is ridiculous!

16:49.600 --> 16:52.560
 These X-rays belong
 to another McEnroe.

16:52.560 --> 16:56.360
 Then I'll give them
 to whoever shows up.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.480
 Be my guest.

16:57.480 --> 17:01.480
 I'll get you
 an autograph.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.440
 You're sure those are
 the real things?

17:05.440 --> 17:07.200
 You positive
 they're not?

17:07.200 --> 17:11.200
 I'll get you
 the autograph.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.440
 How long has
 she been in arrest?

17:26.440 --> 17:29.640
 A minute and a half.
 I waited for you.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.120
 Ventricular tachycardia.
 Heart rate's 120.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.000
 I'll call the code.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.560
 No code, remember?

17:35.560 --> 17:38.080
 Right pupil's pinpoint
 and unresponsive.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.760
 Left pupil's
 totally blown.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.080
 I didn't see
 the approval.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.480
 BP's 40 and falling.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.520
 Dr Griffin.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.600
 We agreed to avoid
 more unnecessary pain.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.080
 I'm getting
 the crash cart.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.480
 Didn't you
 square this away?

17:52.480 --> 17:56.320
 Some patients have
 stayed in v-tach
 five minutes.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.240
 She's hanging on.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.440
 I wish
 this were over.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.160
 Give up the ghost,
 Mrs Hovick.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.080
 Should we have
 called a priest?

18:05.080 --> 18:07.080
 Rabbi.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.920
 In Wisconsin,
 we only had Lutherans.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.160
 What about you?

18:11.160 --> 18:12.600
 Non-denom.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.000
 Most of us
 in Westport never
 bought the programme.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.160
 Ah, Connecticut.

18:17.160 --> 18:20.080
 Used to be
 mostly artists
 living there.

18:20.080 --> 18:24.080
 Now it's movie
 stars peddling
 salad dressing.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.560
 BP's 15.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.880
 She's going
 to haunt me.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.760
 V-fib.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.160
 That's the pup.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.320
 Hasn't anybody
 called the code?

18:35.320 --> 18:36.960
 I thought you got his OK?

18:36.960 --> 18:39.960
 What? This is
 a full arrest.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.360
 Let's move!
 Defib, 300 watts.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.200
 Little slow on
 the uptake, Helen.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.680
 300 watts, ready.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.680
 Clear.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.560
 Comfortable,
 Herr Lukas?

18:56.560 --> 18:58.960
 Ausgezeichnet.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.000
 No misgivings
 about my operating?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.280
 Your word
 is your deed.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.440
 I'm sorry
 I doubted you.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.320
 Danke schon.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.680
 Dr Craig, about what
 I said earlier...

19:10.680 --> 19:14.680
 You've landed yourself
 back on the dark side of
 my moon.

19:14.680 --> 19:18.680
 Get gloved and don't
 touch anything.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.120
 That moron Ehrlich
 really whittles my stick.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.960
 For two years,
 he's beside me,

19:25.960 --> 19:28.880
 and no common sense
 rubs off.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.240
 He's so happy
 in his own world.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.120
 Sometimes
 I wish I were
 more like Victor.

19:35.120 --> 19:39.120
 Never thought
 I'd ever depend more
 on a female resident.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.280
 That's just typical.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.680
 You're riding along,
 everything's smooth.

19:44.680 --> 19:48.680
 Then you hit a bump
 in your personal life,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.400
 and it really
 throws you.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.800
 But I'm like you, sir.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.200
 That doesn't
 affect my surgery.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.120
 Once inside that door,

19:58.120 --> 20:00.040
 there's only
 the patient.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.480
 Right, Dr Craig?

20:01.480 --> 20:05.480
 Huh? Yeah, Wade.

20:42.640 --> 20:46.040
 I'm charting
 time of death.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.280
 Griffin will
 do the rest.

20:48.280 --> 20:52.280
 Close the door
 as you leave.

20:56.160 --> 21:00.160
 Not that a faster
 response would have
 made any difference,

21:01.400 --> 21:03.960
 but why the delay
 in starting the code?

21:03.960 --> 21:07.960
 Yeah.
 Explain, Seth.

21:09.080 --> 21:13.080
 Dr Birch and I arrived
 a minute into the arrest.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.240
 The signals must have
 gotten mixed up.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.640
 Look, we're new.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.120
 That's no excuse,

21:20.120 --> 21:24.120
 but Susan and I have
 to start taking charge.

21:24.400 --> 21:27.320
 We're responsible
 for these patients now.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.840
 This won't happen
 again, Dr Chandler.

21:29.840 --> 21:33.240
 Make sure you sign
 a death certificate

21:33.240 --> 21:37.240
 and turn it in.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.080
 You really
 are a piece of work.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.480
 You take
 a moral stand,

21:43.480 --> 21:46.840
 then chuck it
 when things get hot.

21:46.840 --> 21:50.640
 You have every reason
 to hate my guts.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.560
 I'm not talking
 about Mrs Hovick.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.960
 You said you'd
 follow procedure.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.840
 You lied to me.

21:57.840 --> 22:00.080
 I didn't clear
 the no code,

22:00.080 --> 22:01.640
 and I panicked.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.040
 Next time
 you screw up,

22:04.040 --> 22:08.040
 don't suck me
 into it.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.960
 Although
 a simple procedure,

22:25.960 --> 22:29.200
 this operation
 requires speed.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.320
 Like the Von Trapps
 fleeing from the Nazis.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.200
 You really are
 a Clumperton.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.240
 A what?

22:34.240 --> 22:36.600
 Clumperton! My feelings exactly.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.400
 For Pete's sake...

22:38.400 --> 22:40.120
 You're as adept

22:40.120 --> 22:42.240
 as a teenage girl
 in a car's back seat.

22:42.240 --> 22:45.640
 We'll be removing less
 than a sixth of the lung.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.520
 The abscess cannot burst.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.400
 Otherwise, Ehrlich,
 what happens?

22:50.400 --> 22:52.160
 The other lobes
 fill with fluid.

22:52.160 --> 22:56.160
 Correct. Now that we're
 all on our toes, blade.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.160
 I'll get those bleeders.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.760
 Things get so
 out of control.

23:02.760 --> 23:06.760
 Hard to say
 where Mr Lukas
 started getting worse.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.440
 Robert said
 it wasn't sudden.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.840
 Of course not.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.600
 Many factors contributed
 to his condition.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
 Age, nutrition,
 general health.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.440
 Robert's not a doctor.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.360
 But he's my husband.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.200
 We have to talk.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.200
 Wade, are you here?
 Sober up.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.040
 Now who's
 a Clumperton?

23:26.040 --> 23:28.440
 Let's pretend
 we all attended

23:28.440 --> 23:32.440
 the Marcel Marceau
 medical school.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.040
 You just can't
 help yourself, can you?

23:45.640 --> 23:48.600
 Hey, slow down.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.960
 Want Dr Westphall
 to sign your cast?

23:51.960 --> 23:55.800
 Sure. I wish my friends
 in Seattle could sign it.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.640
 Give Boston
 a chance.

23:58.640 --> 24:02.000
 We read about
 the Boston tea party.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.920
 Jack's taking
 us there.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.360
 We're buying
 Chris a tricorn.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.000
 That's a hat
 with three points.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
 When I go back,
 I'll show my teacher.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.600
 Remember we talked
 about you going
 to school here?

24:14.600 --> 24:18.600
 Yeah, I forgot.

24:19.760 --> 24:20.680
 Do your schools
 have playgrounds?

24:20.680 --> 24:24.560
 Just like
 back in Seattle.

24:24.560 --> 24:28.560
 Only my real dad won't
 drive me every day.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.080
 Hey, hey.
 Come back here.

24:35.080 --> 24:38.920
 You can actually tell
 these are McEnroe's X-rays?

24:38.920 --> 24:41.320
 Of course.
 I'm a doctor.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.720
 That would be
 an experience...

24:43.720 --> 24:45.440
 whacking it
 with Mac.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.120
 I could
 introduce you.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.160
 No, thank you.

24:49.160 --> 24:53.040
 We must respect
 Mr McEnroe's
 privacy.

24:53.040 --> 24:57.040
 But ask him
 how he hits that
 topspin backhand.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.920
 Joanne, would you,
 uh...like to dance?

25:02.920 --> 25:05.320
 I thought
 you'd never ask.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.240
 Would you
 watch him?

25:07.240 --> 25:11.240
 Sure.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.920
 Do you miss Seattle?

25:13.920 --> 25:17.920
 No. Riding the Space
 Needle with Digger
 got boring.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.320
 Your dog?

25:19.320 --> 25:21.280
 No. A hunk.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.040
 But east coast
 guys are better.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.280
 They're more...
 sophisticated.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.080
 Here there's more
 culture and tradition.

25:28.080 --> 25:32.080
 And I bet
 people know
 more about sex.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.880
 Pete!

25:47.440 --> 25:49.320
 Who admitted
 this patient?

25:49.320 --> 25:53.320
 Dr Fiscus. Blood pressure's
 150 over 100, pulse regular.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.800
 Mr Eberbach
 checks in for a
 diabetic evaluation,

25:55.800 --> 25:57.480
 then has some
 kind of seizure.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.760
 His last insulin shot
 was late this afternoon.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.400
 Could this be
 hypoglycaemia?

26:01.400 --> 26:04.680
 Maybe.
 MR EBERBACH MUMBLES

26:04.680 --> 26:06.640
 My guess is heart.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.520
 He's tachycardic
 and diaphoretic.

26:08.520 --> 26:12.080
 This chart lists
 a history of angina.

26:12.080 --> 26:14.280
 He started
 acting peculiar.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.640
 Thought he was at
 the Amoco station.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.040
 Are you having
 chest pains?

26:20.040 --> 26:21.800
 Fill it up, unleaded.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.640
 Check under the hood.

26:23.640 --> 26:26.440
 Are you having
 any pain here?

26:26.440 --> 26:28.360
 I feel
 something pushing.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.600
 Do my wheels
 need aligning?

26:30.600 --> 26:33.280
 What did
 you do?

26:33.280 --> 26:35.120
 50cc, D50 IV.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.640
 Maybe it's
 a mild MI.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.560
 He's having
 chest pain.

26:39.560 --> 26:43.560
 He only said
 something pushed
 on his chest - you.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.440
 Let's get an angio.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.800
 Let's not take
 any chances.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.240
 Wait a minute.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.640
 Blood pressure's
 back to normal.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.840
 Ooh, ooh.
 It's cold.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.080
 Sir,
 how you feeling?

26:58.080 --> 27:00.800
 Hungry.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.240
 About time.

27:02.240 --> 27:06.240
 Somebody flip
 on the tube, huh?

27:18.560 --> 27:20.920
 What just
 happened in there?

27:20.920 --> 27:23.800
 I noticed his
 dinner was late.

27:23.800 --> 27:27.800
 That and his delirium
 indicated low blood sugar.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.520
 So he went
 into shock.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.480
 Right.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.920
 Thanks.
 I appreciate...

27:32.920 --> 27:34.360
 Lose the manners.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.720
 Excuse me?

27:35.720 --> 27:39.640
 You tried sandbagging me
 in Mrs Hovick's room.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.560
 That only happens once.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.800
 Doctors know
 about medicine.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.720
 Nurses know
 about patients

27:45.720 --> 27:48.120
 and how hospitals
 are run.

27:48.120 --> 27:52.120
 Cross me again,
 and you'll get exactly
 what you asked for.

27:56.040 --> 27:59.120
 Jack and I
 grew up together.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.000
 We were friends,
 but never romantic.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.520
 Across the street
 was an apple orchard.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.880
 We used to sit
 in this tree,

28:08.880 --> 28:12.880
 pick apples,
 and complain
 about family and school.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.280
 Do you know David?

28:15.280 --> 28:17.080
 Jack's brother.
 A policeman.

28:17.080 --> 28:21.080
 He fixed us up
 when Jack was
 home last month.

28:21.880 --> 28:25.880
 David knew
 I was divorced.

28:29.480 --> 28:33.320
 Jack and I dated
 a couple of times,

28:33.320 --> 28:37.320
 and then he
 brought me back to
 the apple orchard.

28:38.120 --> 28:41.040
 Actually, now it's Rolling
 Hills Condominiums.

28:41.040 --> 28:45.040
 But we stood
 next to where
 our tree used to be,

28:45.840 --> 28:47.280
 and he proposed.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.360
 And I said no.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.920
 How come?

28:50.920 --> 28:54.760
 Oh, I suppose
 failure of
 my first marriage.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.840
 And the success
 of his.

28:57.840 --> 29:00.240
 Dr Westphall,
 I knew Nina.

29:00.240 --> 29:04.240
 I was up against
 her once for
 Sea Fair Princess

29:04.480 --> 29:06.440
 at the Seattle
 Summer Festival.

29:06.440 --> 29:10.040
 I wasn't going to
 lose to her again.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.480
 What changed your mind
 about marrying Jack?

29:13.480 --> 29:15.880
 After he returned
 to Boston,

29:15.880 --> 29:19.840
 I realised
 I missed him.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.800
 I knew Nina, too.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.240
 She was wonderful.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.240
 She'd want Jack
 to be happy.

29:35.200 --> 29:39.200
 Mr McEnroe?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.040
 You're John Doe.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.320
 John McEnroe.

29:42.320 --> 29:46.120
 No, you lived
 on our psych ward.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.600
 I had a linesman
 like you once.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.480
 Every shot was out.

29:51.480 --> 29:54.880
 Wake up, loser.
 You must be blind.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.800
 That ball was in!

29:56.800 --> 29:58.240
 Those my X-rays?

29:58.240 --> 29:59.680
 Yes, sir.

29:59.680 --> 30:03.680
 Tatum and Jack Mac
 and Farrah and Ryan
 are waiting in the car.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.880
 Uh, Mr McEnroe.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.720
 Dr Auschlander's
 a great fan of yours.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.120
 Mind if I
 introduce you?

30:12.120 --> 30:14.040
 Let's hop the net.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.880
 Think you'll make it
 to Wimbledon this year?

30:17.880 --> 30:19.320
 I'll be there.

30:19.320 --> 30:21.720
 Some people like
 John McEnroe,

30:21.720 --> 30:24.760
 others...

30:24.760 --> 30:28.760
 I'll proceed to put
 a ligature around the artery.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.320
 Snap and tie.

30:31.320 --> 30:34.680
 What kind
 of a hand-off was that?

30:34.680 --> 30:36.600
 Again. Snap and tie!

30:36.600 --> 30:39.880
 Ehrlich, retract
 the upper and lower lobes.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.760
 Don't disturb
 the abscess.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.160
 Need more light
 here, please.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.960
 Are you asking
 her to dance?

30:45.960 --> 30:48.160
 Leave Emily
 in the scrub room.

30:48.160 --> 30:52.160
 That's good.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.480
 Hot as Hades in here.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.400
 Check
 the air-conditioning.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.400
 Clamp.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.880
 Lobes are retracted.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.520
 Give me more exposure
 to clamp the artery.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.760
 I can't rupture
 the abscess.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.560
 I know, knothead.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.000
 There's the artery.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
 All right.

31:23.080 --> 31:25.240
 I'm having
 a little trouble.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.440
 The ligature...

31:26.440 --> 31:29.920
 I can reach the artery
 from this angle.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.680
 I see the artery.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.560
 I know how
 this is done.

31:34.560 --> 31:38.560
 So simple.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.440
 I can't do it.

31:51.440 --> 31:55.440
 You two will have to
 finish the operation.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.160
 Where's Ehrlich?

32:15.160 --> 32:18.000
 Staying with Mr Lukas
 during post-op.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.920
 Probably having
 more laughs.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.160
 This occasion
 should be happy.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.400
 This blow-out's
 had a blow-out.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.400
 You have no sense
 of celebration.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.960
 I never bought you
 a wedding present.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.840
 Hey, that's OK.

32:33.840 --> 32:37.840
 I'll find something
 that brings your family
 together.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.680
 Have a good marriage,
 Boomer.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.800
 Thanks.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.240
 Let's all
 raise our glasses

32:50.240 --> 32:53.440
 and wish
 the Morrisons well.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.840
 Perhaps the poet Rilke
 put it best...

32:56.840 --> 32:58.240
 "A good marriage

32:58.240 --> 33:02.200
 "is one in which
 each appoints the other

33:02.200 --> 33:06.200
 "guardian of his solitude."

33:07.280 --> 33:11.280
 What did Rilke know?

33:12.520 --> 33:16.440
 You said
 you'd handle
 this operation.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.920
 My hand cramped.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.440
 Why would you
 put your ego

33:20.440 --> 33:22.400
 before
 this patient's life?

33:22.400 --> 33:25.240
 Mr Lukas
 was never in danger.

33:25.240 --> 33:28.600
 I thought I was
 ready to operate.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.520
 You're rushing
 yourself, Mark.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.920
 You can't go on
 operating.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.840
 What do I do?

33:34.840 --> 33:36.760
 Run your department,
 teach.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.560
 I've been teaching
 since the accident.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.000
 I'm not here

33:41.000 --> 33:43.400
 to attend
 Tuesday afternoon lectures.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.800
 I'm more vital
 than that!

33:45.800 --> 33:47.680
 Of course you are.

33:47.680 --> 33:51.480
 If you weren't so busy
 solving everybody's problems,

33:51.480 --> 33:55.320
 you'd remember what
 being a doctor is like!

33:55.320 --> 33:58.680
 Mark, we've
 known each other
 since internship.

33:58.680 --> 34:02.000
 I know what
 you'd be giving up.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
 I used to be a whiz
 at valve replacements,
 bypass grafts,

34:06.560 --> 34:08.880
 microvascular
 reconstructions...

34:08.880 --> 34:11.280
 I could roll a quarter
 down my fingers.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.639
 Now I can barely
 tie my shoes.

34:14.639 --> 34:18.000
 No-one doubts
 your contribution
 to St Eligius.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
 For now,
 take a rest.

34:26.840 --> 34:29.239
 The rain's
 cooling things off.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.679
 Need a lift?

34:30.679 --> 34:34.480
 No. My son's coming
 to pick me up.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.880
 Excellent call
 on Mr Eberbach.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.280
 Every July,
 I watch residents

34:39.280 --> 34:41.679
 trying to become
 good doctors,

34:41.679 --> 34:44.840
 but there's always
 a couple like you

34:44.840 --> 34:46.960
 who want things
 their way.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.880
 I'm not like that.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.719
 Yes, you are,
 and you're
 good at it.

34:52.719 --> 34:56.560
 Someday, your
 slick reputation
 will hit the wards

34:56.560 --> 34:58.960
 and get
 to Dr Westphall,

34:58.960 --> 35:01.360
 who will
 come see me

35:01.360 --> 35:03.760
 because he trusts
 my judgment.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.760
 That's when
 payback begins,
 Dr Griffin.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.120
 When I was seven,

35:10.120 --> 35:12.520
 my mother developed
 rheumatoid arthritis.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.760
 I remember,
 at the hospital,

35:14.760 --> 35:18.760
 hanging on the bed rail,
 watching her lying there,

35:18.760 --> 35:20.680
 twisted like a pretzel.

35:20.680 --> 35:24.280
 I kept wondering,
 "Why don't you fight, Mom?"

35:24.280 --> 35:27.160
 After she died,
 I just decided

35:27.160 --> 35:30.520
 there must come
 a time in life

35:30.520 --> 35:32.600
 when you
 have to surrender.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.840
 Standing beside
 Mrs Hovick's bed

35:34.840 --> 35:38.360
 was no easier than
 standing beside my mother's.

35:38.360 --> 35:42.160
 You're right.
 We got to go out kicking.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.600
 CAR HORN HONKS

35:43.600 --> 35:45.040
 That's me.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.080
 We got off
 on the wrong foot.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.000
 Can we start again?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.720
 Be a nice way
 to end the day.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.720
 See you tomorrow,
 Dr Griffin.

36:11.480 --> 36:14.440
 How's he doing?

36:14.440 --> 36:17.320
 He lost 400cc
 of blood,

36:17.320 --> 36:20.680
 but vitals
 are stable.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.080
 You were great
 in surgery,

36:23.080 --> 36:24.680
 considering
 this hand.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.080
 Today was
 just a glitch.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.960
 Check the haematocrit
 in another hour.

36:29.960 --> 36:33.960
 Sir, the opportunity
 to learn from you...

36:33.960 --> 36:35.400
 you're the reason

36:35.400 --> 36:39.160
 I turned down
 surgical residency
 at Boston General.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.600
 We all must live
 with our mistakes.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.440
 400cc of blood
 is inexcusable.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.280
 Control
 of haemostasis
 is essential.

36:48.280 --> 36:50.680
 The next time
 you operate,

36:50.680 --> 36:54.680
 remember to tug
 a little harder
 on those sutures.

37:02.640 --> 37:06.360
 You know, DA,
 of all the DRs at St E,
 you are the RX.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.840
 Here you are,

37:07.840 --> 37:10.680
 taking time
 after a busy day.

37:10.680 --> 37:14.440
 And with liver cancer,
 you don't have many left,
 busy or otherwise.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.320
 Your turn.

37:17.320 --> 37:21.320
 Dr Weiss is nice,
 but he has to be.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.000
 To him,
 I'm a patient.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.400
 To you,
 I'm a friend,

37:26.400 --> 37:28.920
 not just another
 case study.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.800
 You're a pip short.

37:30.800 --> 37:31.800
 So's Gladys Knight.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.200
 The dice
 show seven pips.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.120
 You only
 moved six.

37:36.120 --> 37:39.480
 Hey, let's
 find ourselves
 a court, huh?

37:39.480 --> 37:41.880
 Concrete,
 grass, clay...

37:41.880 --> 37:44.680
 doesn't matter.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.120
 McEnroe...

37:46.120 --> 37:48.040
 aggressive,
 self-confident...

37:48.040 --> 37:48.960
 rich...

37:48.960 --> 37:50.920
 rich...rich...

37:50.920 --> 37:54.720
 He sees the shot,
 takes it.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.800
 He doesn't
 have a shot,

37:56.800 --> 37:58.240
 he takes it.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.600
 Wins every time.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.600
 You're not McEnroe.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.280
 Let's stop
 this charade.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.360
 Charades.

38:07.360 --> 38:08.840
 I'll go first.

38:08.840 --> 38:12.680
 It's time to call
 a spade a spade.

38:12.680 --> 38:14.120
 Cards? Sure.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.680
 Start playing
 the game of life.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.920
 I've played that...
 Milton Bradley.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.080
 # You can put yourself
 through college

38:20.080 --> 38:21.160
 # If you want
 a lot of knowledge

38:21.160 --> 38:22.160
 # Or start up
 your own business

38:22.160 --> 38:23.160
 # If you think
 you're going far

38:23.160 --> 38:27.160
 # I want to be a star! #

38:31.560 --> 38:35.560
 It's just back
 to being John Doe
 number six again.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.680
 When Lucinda and
 Ramsey came for me,

38:41.680 --> 38:45.680
 I wanted to believe
 I belonged to their family.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.560
 It was fun
 being Thomas Farrar,
 corporate genius.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.440
 But that's not
 who I am.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.800
 I'm not Mary Richards,
 William Shakespeare,

38:55.800 --> 38:59.800
 or Dr Jonas Wissner.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.240
 John...

39:03.240 --> 39:05.640
 we all
 spend our days

39:05.640 --> 39:08.040
 finding out
 who we are.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.960
 It's very much
 like a game...

39:10.960 --> 39:12.360
 based on
 percentages,

39:12.360 --> 39:13.800
 requiring
 strategies,

39:13.800 --> 39:15.560
 persistence,
 and even luck.

39:15.560 --> 39:18.360
 Now it's
 your turn.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.240
 You can be
 whoever you are,

39:21.240 --> 39:25.240
 but you can't be
 somebody else.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.760
 It's like I never
 left this place.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.680
 It's all a-OK.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.160
 I'm home.

39:38.160 --> 39:39.360
 For now.

39:39.360 --> 39:43.360
 No. Home board.
 Backgammon. Pay up.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.480
 Nice of Wayne
 to give us a party.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.480
 Kids loved it.

40:02.360 --> 40:05.200
 Your friends really
 care about you.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.640
 Dr Westphall...

40:06.640 --> 40:09.040
 He's been
 good to me,

40:09.040 --> 40:11.360
 especially when...

40:11.360 --> 40:13.760
 Nina died?

40:13.760 --> 40:15.160
 No.

40:15.160 --> 40:19.160
 Even though
 I changed my mind
 about marrying you,

40:19.160 --> 40:22.080
 I still haven't
 overcome my fears

40:22.080 --> 40:26.000
 of filling
 Nina's void.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.400
 Just being
 in this room...

40:28.400 --> 40:29.840
 We'll move.

40:29.840 --> 40:31.280
 No.

40:31.280 --> 40:34.480
 A new address won't
 take away my doubts.

40:34.480 --> 40:37.840
 I lived with Nina
 a long time.

40:37.840 --> 40:41.840
 I lived without her
 for just as long.

40:42.800 --> 40:46.800
 I didn't marry you to fill
 some job description...

40:48.840 --> 40:52.720
 ..expecting you
 to dress the way she did,

40:52.720 --> 40:56.040
 or make lasagne
 the way she did.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.520
 Wait a minute.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.920
 Nina and I
 cooked together

40:59.920 --> 41:02.320
 for the church's
 potluck suppers.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.600
 Nina made
 lousy lasagne.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.520
 I know.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.400
 What about
 if I teach you

41:09.400 --> 41:13.400
 how to play tennis
 this weekend?

41:15.560 --> 41:18.960
 I'll never fall asleep
 on that couch.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.840
 Don't get
 comfortable here.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.760
 Can't I stay
 a little while?

41:23.760 --> 41:27.760
 Off with
 your sneakers.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.560
 Jack...

41:30.560 --> 41:31.920
 What?

41:31.920 --> 41:35.240
 I was thinking
 about school.

41:35.240 --> 41:39.240
 Can you walk me
 the first day?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.080
 Every day...

41:43.080 --> 41:44.520
 if you want.

41:44.520 --> 41:48.520
 Good.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.680
 Caitlin! Gee!

41:52.680 --> 41:54.160
 I'm sorry.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.560
 Living with
 Mom and Chris,

41:56.560 --> 42:00.560
 I got used
 to walking in.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.760
 I heard
 what happened.

42:14.760 --> 42:18.320
 Just because
 he punched a picture,

42:18.320 --> 42:19.720
 his career's over.

42:19.720 --> 42:23.520
 You should've seen
 Craig's face in the OR,

42:23.520 --> 42:26.440
 when he couldn't
 finish the operation.

42:26.440 --> 42:28.840
 I meant
 you and Robert.

42:28.840 --> 42:32.840
 I know
 the feeling.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.800
 My first girlfriend,
 Cathy Cobb,

42:35.800 --> 42:39.800
 jumped off
 the teeter-totter
 when I was up.

42:40.120 --> 42:44.120
 I hit the ground
 and caught myself
 where it counts.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.840
 Would you feel better

42:46.840 --> 42:50.680
 if I said I think
 Robert's a jerk?

42:50.680 --> 42:52.120
 Probably not.

42:52.120 --> 42:55.600
 I don't need to find
 I'm stupid enough

42:55.600 --> 42:59.120
 to stay married
 to a jerk for 11 years.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.360
 But thanks, Wayne.

43:01.360 --> 43:05.360
 I've been sitting here
 for two hours,

43:05.600 --> 43:07.520
 afraid to go home

43:07.520 --> 43:11.080
 because my husband
 won't be there.

43:11.080 --> 43:15.080
 Robert and I
 started dating
 when we were 17.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.280
 I haven't been
 without him since.

43:18.280 --> 43:22.160
 The longest I've been
 with someone's a year.

43:22.160 --> 43:25.040
 One romp through
 the four seasons,

43:25.040 --> 43:26.760
 then boot camp.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.040
 You never enlisted.

43:28.040 --> 43:32.040
 Debbie did.
 The air force.

43:33.160 --> 43:37.160
 Well, maybe I'll
 sleep here tonight.

43:37.320 --> 43:40.520
 I'm beat.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.960
 It's funny.

43:41.960 --> 43:44.360
 It feels like
 Lewiston High,

43:44.360 --> 43:46.760
 winter carnival
 my senior year,

43:46.760 --> 43:50.760
 the one time
 Robert and I broke up.

43:51.520 --> 43:55.520
 I'm standing there
 in the hallway alone...

43:56.440 --> 43:59.400
 with no friends.

43:59.400 --> 44:00.880
 Only difference is,

44:00.880 --> 44:04.880
 we're not getting
 back together this time.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.120
 For seven years,

44:10.120 --> 44:14.120
 I've been putting
 so much into my own career.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.320
 Jackie...

44:17.320 --> 44:20.640
 I thought my marriage
 would last forever.

44:20.640 --> 44:24.520
 That's how long
 I had it scheduled for.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.040
 Jackie,
 you're naked.

44:26.040 --> 44:30.040
 Huh?

44:30.600 --> 44:33.880
 Oh.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.040
 Oh.

44:35.040 --> 44:39.040
 SHE CRIES

44:42.520 --> 44:46.400
 Just sit down.

44:46.400 --> 44:50.400
 You'll be all right.

44:53.240 --> 44:57.240
 Oh, God.
