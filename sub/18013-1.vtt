WEBVTT

01:42.022 --> 01:44.513
(whispers) Miss Bird...

01:45.650 --> 01:47.643
...said...

01:49.571 --> 01:51.563
...brightly.

01:51.781 --> 01:54.319
(birds twittering)

01:56.243 --> 01:58.532
(twittering reverberates)

02:12.884 --> 02:15.838
(doctor)
Does that make you feel funny, son?

02:16.053 --> 02:19.220
You don't feel woozy?
Like you might faint?

02:19.432 --> 02:21.590
- No, sir.
- Good.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.430
I know it's writin', Thad.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.720
This all started just about the same time
you started with your stories.

02:29.024 --> 02:31.894
- Sittin' in the dark, squintin' to see.
- (doctor) Hm.

02:32.277 --> 02:36.440
Couldn't that be it, Doctor? Couldn't
all this come from strainin' his eyes?

02:36.656 --> 02:41.234
Possibly. But these sounds,
these bird sounds he's hearing.

02:41.535 --> 02:46.493
Sometimes a smell or a sound can be
a sign of something more than eyestrain.

02:46.665 --> 02:50.449
I don't think we have an emergency,
but we'll have to watch it, Thad.

02:50.669 --> 02:52.911
- Wanna be a writer, do ya?
- Yes, sir.

02:53.129 --> 02:56.130
If he's so determined,
you oughta buy the man a typewriter.

02:56.299 --> 02:58.707
We have our eye on a used one.

02:58.885 --> 03:00.961
Been savin' up for it.

03:01.345 --> 03:04.299
Maybe we ought to go ahead
and buy it, huh, Thad?

03:07.268 --> 03:10.268
Seven-thirty, Thad. You'll miss your bus.

03:13.982 --> 03:16.224
Let's go, hotshot.

03:18.153 --> 03:20.145
Thaddeus.

03:37.504 --> 03:40.505
My Lord. All this in one mornin'?

03:55.354 --> 03:57.560
(whispers) Thaddeus!

03:57.773 --> 04:01.437
Polly! There's something
wrong with Thad Beaumont.

04:01.818 --> 04:04.439
Stay in your seats. Stay in your seats.

04:06.364 --> 04:08.652
Thad? What's wrong, honey?

04:09.700 --> 04:14.077
Three-by-five-centimetre window in
the upper-left anterior portion of the skull.

04:14.330 --> 04:17.117
- (nurse) BP is steady at 120 over 80.
- I'm opening.

04:18.375 --> 04:21.495
- Oh, my.
- (anaesthetist) Slight fluctuation.

04:21.711 --> 04:24.748
Hilary! Remember where you are, please.

04:25.548 --> 04:28.466
(nurse) Respiration normal at 65.

04:30.595 --> 04:32.801
(screams)

04:34.515 --> 04:36.922
- Get someone in here.
- What in the world is it?

04:37.267 --> 04:40.138
It's nothing. Once it was a twin.

04:40.312 --> 04:42.803
- Now it's nothing.
- A twin?

04:43.023 --> 04:45.561
Unborn, but absorbed into the system.

04:45.734 --> 04:48.853
We'll continue with 18 units of valium,
packed cells.

04:49.070 --> 04:51.561
We have an eye...

04:51.989 --> 04:54.361
...part of a nostril...

04:54.575 --> 04:56.318
...two teeth.

04:56.535 --> 04:59.156
Hm. One of the teeth has a small cavity.

05:00.956 --> 05:04.206
A year ago this was probably
submicroscopic in size.

05:04.418 --> 05:10.337
Somehow it... got itself going again.
The damn thing actually started to grow.

05:10.507 --> 05:13.128
- Incredible.
- Don't ask me why.

05:14.093 --> 05:18.506
All I know is that we've located
a very rare sort of... tumour.

05:19.265 --> 05:23.345
Close call, folks,
but I think we got here just in time.

05:23.519 --> 05:26.555
I'm getting
a slight elevation in blood pressure.

06:04.682 --> 06:07.089
What the hell...?

06:17.193 --> 06:21.819
Beautiful in Atlanta, no delays. Dallas,
Fort Worth, experiencing thunderstorms.

06:22.031 --> 06:26.111
Watch out for serious weather in this
area. Could be some tornado activity.

06:26.327 --> 06:30.704
Strong thunderstorms back through
the central Rockies as well.

06:41.216 --> 06:44.999
Honey, can I... Can Mommy have that?
Thank you very much.

06:52.393 --> 06:55.144
William. Don't... don't do that, buddy.

06:55.312 --> 06:58.099
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- A born editor.

06:58.857 --> 07:01.348
- It's not that bad, is it?
- (William gurgles)

07:01.568 --> 07:04.853
Guess it is. Just a sec.
I got something for you.

07:06.864 --> 07:09.106
I act like a pure klutz.

07:12.244 --> 07:14.533
There. Play with these things.

07:20.710 --> 07:25.087
- What do you think, Mommy?
- Sh. Just a minute. I'm on the last page.

07:35.182 --> 07:37.471
- Not much?
- Not much?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.968
- It's wonderful.
- There's not a lot there.

07:41.188 --> 07:43.476
I stay up all night
and produce nine lousy pages.

07:43.690 --> 07:47.984
- Nine perfect pages. It's great.
- But is it a best seller?

07:48.194 --> 07:51.065
Who cares?
It's gonna be a great book, Thad.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.981
You're doing it.
You are actually really doing it.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.120
Oh...

07:59.538 --> 08:01.614
It's not comin' outta me easy.

08:05.877 --> 08:08.748
(Thad) We are human beings. Plural.

08:10.632 --> 08:14.214
Each one of us is two separate beings.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.961
There's the outer being,
the one we show to the world at large.

08:18.305 --> 08:20.464
Inhibited, timid...

08:21.100 --> 08:23.673
- Often a pathological liar.
- (laughter)

08:24.186 --> 08:26.474
And then there's the inner being.

08:28.064 --> 08:30.306
The truthful one.

08:30.900 --> 08:34.649
Passionate, uninhibited, even lustful.

08:36.114 --> 08:40.325
And most of us keep that inner being
hidden away, locked up.

08:40.993 --> 08:46.034
But the fiction writer doesn't have to hide
it, doesn't have to keep it from anything.

08:46.248 --> 08:49.165
He can let it out,
bring it out in the open, let it live.

08:49.584 --> 08:51.909
Hell, he can give it the car keys, let it ride!

08:52.087 --> 08:54.328
Yes!

08:55.298 --> 08:58.464
In fact, he has to do that.

08:59.552 --> 09:04.794
It's essential. The writer has to let
that inner being out of the lockup.

09:06.016 --> 09:10.761
He has to let it have a voice in his work
otherwise the work itself will be inhibited.

09:10.979 --> 09:13.221
Timid. Without passion.

09:16.526 --> 09:19.017
It'll be a pack of lies.

09:24.784 --> 09:27.820
I think we'll cut it short today.
I was up all night working.

09:28.162 --> 09:31.032
- That inner being kept me awake. I...
- (laughter)

09:31.456 --> 09:34.991
Your stories are due on Wednesday.
Don't forget.

09:59.941 --> 10:02.942
Uh, w...
would you autograph your book for me?

10:03.695 --> 10:06.814
Just make it out to Fred. Fred Clawson.

10:07.657 --> 10:10.361
- That's not my book.
- Isn't it?

10:10.534 --> 10:12.443
No. Look here.

10:12.619 --> 10:14.695
Hm?

10:15.080 --> 10:17.203
The picture's a phoney.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.949
The name too. "George Stark. "

10:21.086 --> 10:22.912
Phoney.

10:23.129 --> 10:25.287
I know all about it.

10:27.925 --> 10:30.760
(Clawson)
It's my turn to be storyteller, OK?

10:30.970 --> 10:34.339
There's this writer, see?
Let's call him "Beaumont".

10:34.515 --> 10:38.927
He writes a coupla highbrow books
about yuppies and faggots.

10:39.853 --> 10:44.016
The critics rave but nobody buys,
so he changes his style.

10:44.274 --> 10:46.313
He starts writing
about tits and tough guys.

10:46.526 --> 10:49.147
- He dreams up this badass character.
- Machine.

10:49.487 --> 10:51.396
- Yeah.
- Alexis Machine.

10:51.989 --> 10:57.576
He calls himself George Stark, so his
mother won't find out he writes this shit.

10:59.746 --> 11:04.123
He slaps a phoney picture on the back,
boom! He sells a million copies.

11:04.334 --> 11:08.034
So he writes three more of these things.
Boom, boom, boom. He gets rich.

11:08.254 --> 11:12.797
- Not that rich.
- Rich enough, I think. Rich enough.

11:13.009 --> 11:15.582
So, what's he gonna write next?

11:15.803 --> 11:19.302
A nice big cheque, if he wants me
to keep my mouth shut about this.

11:19.515 --> 11:21.922
And if he doesn't want?

11:23.185 --> 11:27.265
- What if he doesn't care what you do?
- Oh, he wants. He cares.

11:28.481 --> 11:30.723
And if he doesn't,
the people around him do.

11:30.942 --> 11:32.899
They got a major-league scam goin' here.

11:33.111 --> 11:38.021
There's a million Americans out there just
waiting to lay out their 29 and change...

11:38.240 --> 11:40.149
...for George to give 'em another hard-on.

11:40.367 --> 11:45.243
They believe in George Stark. They
believe he's writin' about shit he knows.

11:45.414 --> 11:49.707
They find out they've been lied to, that 29
and change might go back in the pocket.

11:49.876 --> 11:54.253
And I don't think you or the people
around you wanna take that chance.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.209
- How'd you find out?
- This babe who works for your publisher.

11:59.427 --> 12:03.638
I live in New York. She gave me the whole
story. It's like Machine says in your book.

12:03.847 --> 12:08.176
"At nine o'clock, she came.
At ten o'clock, she came across. "

12:11.771 --> 12:17.441
I've written about slime before, Clawson,
but none of it as low to the ground as you.

12:17.652 --> 12:20.902
- Maybe you'll put me in a book someday.
- Oh, I will.

12:21.113 --> 12:23.687
And I'll make you suffer.

12:23.908 --> 12:26.196
Before you die.

12:30.497 --> 12:33.747
Uh, look,
I got a bus to catch back to New York.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.909
You think about it.

12:36.127 --> 12:38.203
- "To Fred"?
- Huh?

12:41.841 --> 12:43.714
Oh, yeah.

12:47.471 --> 12:51.765
Look, you talk to your people, see what
it's worth to keep this outta the papers.

12:53.727 --> 12:58.602
I'll call you in a few days, and
we can negotiate the, uh, payment plan.

12:58.815 --> 13:01.566
Oh, and thanks for the autograph.

13:05.905 --> 13:09.487
(wife) Don't go crazy over this.
We'll figure out a way to handle it.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.950
Oh, it's just such an invasion.
Who needs this shit?

13:14.162 --> 13:15.657
- (metallic thud)
- (babies cry)

13:15.831 --> 13:17.823
Oh...

13:21.544 --> 13:24.995
OK, come on. You're gonna help me.
They're both up.

13:25.757 --> 13:29.006
Who's the best boy? Who's the best boy?

13:29.760 --> 13:32.002
Who's all wet? Whoo-oo.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.339
OK. OK.

13:37.976 --> 13:40.182
There you go.

13:40.604 --> 13:43.011
OK, just a minute, swirly-whirly.

13:45.942 --> 13:50.235
I know how you could blow this guy off,
really knock him for a loop.

13:50.446 --> 13:53.019
- I'd like to knock him for a loop.
- (baby gurgles)

13:53.240 --> 13:57.451
Little stinker.
That dirty little stinker. That little rat.

13:57.661 --> 14:00.366
I oughta go get him.
That's what Alexis Machine would do.

14:00.580 --> 14:03.914
He'd cut off his pecker
and shove it in his little rat mouth...

14:04.084 --> 14:07.666
...so when they found him,
they'd know he was a squealer.

14:16.595 --> 14:20.379
- How can I knock him for a loop?
- Go to the press yourself.

14:20.599 --> 14:22.888
Tell them "I'm George Stark. "

14:28.273 --> 14:30.479
OK, come on.

14:34.028 --> 14:37.444
Eat hearty. If I do this crazy thing
your mother's talkin' about...

14:37.656 --> 14:39.613
...we'll end up livin' on cat food.

14:39.908 --> 14:44.950
I think Thad Beaumont can sell enough
books to keep his family off the streets.

14:46.832 --> 14:51.826
What do you guys think, huh? Is it
time to say "Bye-bye, Uncle George?"

14:54.797 --> 14:56.754
Yeah. Hm.

14:58.968 --> 15:01.423
Well, I guess it's unanimous.

15:04.014 --> 15:06.635
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

15:10.562 --> 15:12.554
Oh, no.

15:16.192 --> 15:18.350
- Shit!
- That's all right.

15:18.569 --> 15:23.278
- I think I cooked it a little too long.
- No, it'II... it'll be good.

15:23.699 --> 15:25.442
(she laughs)

15:27.452 --> 15:32.161
So that's the story, Rick. It seems like
going public is the right thing to do.

15:32.582 --> 15:37.789
I just need to know you're all right with it.
Stark earns a lot more for you than I do.

15:38.004 --> 15:42.796
Well, hey, if you don't want me to do
this, I'll give it some more thought.

15:47.471 --> 15:49.428
Yeah.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.965
Yeah... No, absolutely.

15:52.184 --> 15:54.176
Oh, yeah, sure we have.

15:56.187 --> 15:59.556
- Miriam? What, is she there?
- (whispers) Are you kidding?

15:59.774 --> 16:01.767
You guys patching things up?

16:01.984 --> 16:05.436
No such thing. We're committed
to making our divorce work.

16:05.654 --> 16:09.272
But she still is my business partner.
She's picking up the extension.

16:09.575 --> 16:14.367
Thad, your new book is gonna
win awards and sell 200,000 hardback.

16:14.788 --> 16:17.243
Who needs George Stark?
We'll help you get rid of him.

16:17.457 --> 16:22.617
I'll put out a press release, you can
do the talk shows. I say hallelujah.

16:22.837 --> 16:25.506
You heard the lady, Thad.
We're with you 100o/, baby.

16:25.715 --> 16:28.122
Bye, Thad. Kiss the babies for me.

16:28.342 --> 16:30.798
- Bye-bye.
- Talk to you soon.

16:32.930 --> 16:36.263
- Shit.
- He shouldn't be writing trash.

16:36.683 --> 16:39.091
We have a lot of clients
who can make us money with trash.

16:39.311 --> 16:43.094
I like trash. I love trash.
I read George Stark cos it's fun.

16:43.314 --> 16:45.722
I read Thad Beaumont
because it's my job.

16:45.942 --> 16:49.560
That's why we now live
across town from each other.

16:51.155 --> 16:53.646
Let's get back to work.

16:59.413 --> 17:03.280
(Rick) So we kill off George Stark.
OK, that's OK. We kill off Stark.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.915
Hey, maybe Beaumont's books
start to sell. Who knows?

17:07.086 --> 17:11.665
Stranger things have happened.
Stranger things have happened.

17:15.844 --> 17:18.513
- You're not sold on this?
- It's the money, Liz.

17:18.722 --> 17:21.925
We're used to a pretty nice life.
Flushing that away just...

17:22.142 --> 17:26.435
Be honest, Thad. You don't wanna give up
George. You've become attached to him.

17:26.730 --> 17:31.557
Yeah, well, I mean, is that so weird? I've
been working with the guy for a long time.

17:31.776 --> 17:34.730
I'm used to him. I like having him around.

17:35.071 --> 17:39.282
Sure. He lets you do what you want, say
anything you want, be anything you want.

17:39.491 --> 17:41.947
He's your drinking buddy.

17:42.911 --> 17:45.367
Liz, I'm not an alcoholic. Hm?

17:46.206 --> 17:48.329
- George Stark is.
- Oh, come on.

17:48.625 --> 17:51.958
You don't realise what you're like
when you write those books, do you?

17:52.170 --> 17:56.666
- It's like watching Jekyll turn into Hyde.
- That's a little extreme.

17:56.966 --> 17:58.246
I'm not out raping barmaids.

17:58.426 --> 18:03.134
Thad Beaumont gave up drinking.
He gave up smoking. George Stark didn't.

18:03.347 --> 18:06.383
And these god-awful moods you get in...

18:07.726 --> 18:11.260
You say these really
mean things sometimes.

18:11.688 --> 18:15.436
Look, I am who I am, Liz.
It's all me. It's all part of me.

18:17.276 --> 18:19.518
Even the ugliness is a part of me.

18:20.446 --> 18:23.565
"Machine turned the razor down
and slashed the strop in two. "

18:23.782 --> 18:27.483
"A long section fell to the floor
like a severed tongue. "

18:28.286 --> 18:32.154
"'Cut him' Jack Rainsley said eagerly.
'Cut him while I stand and watch. "'

18:32.415 --> 18:34.574
"'I wanna see the blood flow. "'

18:34.792 --> 18:39.454
"Halstead squeezed his eyes shut, but the
razor slid effortlessly through the lid...

18:39.630 --> 18:43.877
...and punctured the eyeball beneath
with a faint popping sound. "

18:44.927 --> 18:48.130
"'I'm back' Machine said.
'I'm back from the dead...

18:48.347 --> 18:52.889
...and you don't seem glad to see me at all,
you ungrateful son of a bitch. "'

18:53.268 --> 18:58.428
Yeah, well. I hope you're not looking for
any social significance, Mr Donaldson...

18:58.606 --> 19:01.311
...because there ain't none to be found.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.866
You're the New Yorker.
I can tell by the hair.

19:22.086 --> 19:25.918
Mike Donaldson, People Magazine.
You're, uh... the photographer?

19:26.132 --> 19:30.046
Yes, sir. Homer Gamache.
I'm gonna do this up brown for you.

19:30.260 --> 19:32.632
And you're Thad Beaumont.

19:32.888 --> 19:36.720
Seen you around town. Whoever'd
have thought you was a celebrity?

19:36.933 --> 19:41.559
- I'm not the celebrity. George Stark is.
- Well, we're here to change that.

19:41.771 --> 19:45.899
Come on, you guys. Let's go.
Thad, will you grab my purse, please?

19:46.067 --> 19:48.273
- Yeah.
- OK. All right.

19:48.444 --> 19:50.769
All right, I got the diaper bag.

19:59.204 --> 20:01.659
- You've got a terrific getaway.
- Thank you.

20:02.082 --> 20:03.280
- (doorbell)
- Oh, excuse me.

20:03.500 --> 20:07.367
We can never get up here. When Thad's
teaching, we have to stay in the city.

20:07.587 --> 20:10.042
Trudy, thanks for coming over.

20:10.423 --> 20:13.127
- Did they take pictures of the little ones?
- No.

20:13.551 --> 20:16.587
Good. Kidnappers around, you know.

20:16.804 --> 20:19.555
They might see a picture,
it might give 'em some ideas.

20:19.723 --> 20:21.965
They're not gonna take
pictures of the kids.

20:22.184 --> 20:25.718
Not while I'm around they won't.
These men make a mess, don't they?

20:25.937 --> 20:28.179
- Well...
- Come on, let's go upstairs.

20:29.023 --> 20:34.100
I'm doin' a series of photographs.
You... you might be interested in this.

20:34.904 --> 20:37.192
Photographs of teddy bears.

20:38.115 --> 20:42.278
Lyin' in coffins!
I wanna make 'em into a book.

20:42.494 --> 20:47.832
The final perfect comment
on the American way of... death.

20:48.750 --> 20:51.454
All this folderol we put ourselves through.

20:52.503 --> 20:55.919
Hate funerals. Hate any kind of folderol.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.125
I'll show it to you when it's done.

20:58.384 --> 21:02.511
Who knows?
Maybe you'd like to... write the text.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.886
Not much of a view.

21:11.062 --> 21:15.937
If I had a window in here I think
I'd just sit and stare at the lake all day.

21:17.276 --> 21:21.938
This is where George Stark
came into being. Right here in this room.

21:22.364 --> 21:26.029
- I noticed the old typewriter.
- Yeah, I've had that since I was a boy.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.912
- I still use it. George doesn't.
- You're kidding.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.576
No. George doesn't hold with typewriters.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.363
George uses one of these.

21:36.085 --> 21:38.493
From day one, he's used these.

21:39.297 --> 21:41.704
You really are serious?

21:41.924 --> 21:44.166
Dead serious. It's the truth.

21:48.180 --> 21:51.264
- Was it hard to get George started?
- No.

21:51.558 --> 21:53.716
One evening I was just sitting here.

21:53.935 --> 21:56.390
I picked up one of these pencils.

21:57.563 --> 22:01.940
Before I knew it, I'd written 16 pages
without a single scratch-out.

22:02.109 --> 22:04.149
It was like George just...

22:04.361 --> 22:06.733
...woke up and started to talk.

22:14.329 --> 22:17.698
You'II, uh... forgive me for noting...

22:17.916 --> 22:20.453
...but these behaviours
could be interpreted...

22:20.626 --> 22:23.378
...as classic symptoms of schizophrenia.

22:24.672 --> 22:27.791
Yes, I'll forgive you for noting that.

22:28.592 --> 22:31.165
I don't think George would, though.

22:31.803 --> 22:35.338
I don't think George would like any of this,
Mr Donaldson.

22:35.515 --> 22:38.469
This isn't George's idea of a fun morning.

22:39.352 --> 22:44.346
In fact, I think it's safe to say that George
would want your balls for breakfast.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.919
- Thaddeus. Elizabeth.
- Hi, Digger.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.756
I hope you don't mind crazy Homer.

23:10.923 --> 23:15.300
- He wants to set up a fake tombstone.
- A fake tombstone?

23:15.511 --> 23:18.381
"You don't want to go
walkin' on the dead" I says.

23:18.597 --> 23:22.179
"Make sure you use an empty plot
where nobody's buried. "

23:22.392 --> 23:25.346
Then I remembered
"Thad Beaumont owns one"...

23:25.520 --> 23:29.932
...that your daddy bought for you over here
near where your ma and pa is buried.

23:30.149 --> 23:32.557
So I said "Why don't you use that?"

23:32.777 --> 23:35.446
So, I hope you don't mind.

23:35.654 --> 23:37.730
This is where Homer is settin' up.

23:37.865 --> 23:41.068
GEORGE STARK 1985-1991
GEEN AARDIGE vENT

23:42.160 --> 23:46.869
This was my idea. I was takin' pictures
of teddy bears when I thought of it.

23:47.373 --> 23:51.323
Ain't it a hoot? I told you
I was gonna do this up brown for ya.

23:51.544 --> 23:57.297
Must be strange for you, Thad.
Kinda like standing over your own grave.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.500
You know, I just... I really think
that this is, you know, a little much.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.926
- Yeah.
- Aw, it's good fun, is all.

24:04.139 --> 24:07.638
- New York's gonna love it. Wait and see.
- The American way of death.

24:07.851 --> 24:11.350
That's it! A little folderol
for old George there.

24:11.562 --> 24:16.354
- Come on in now. We're losin' the light.
- Why not just take a couple of Thad?

24:16.567 --> 24:18.560
All right. OK.

24:18.736 --> 24:21.736
Come in near the stone.
I'll just be a minute now.

24:21.947 --> 24:24.070
Damned if it don't look real.

24:25.367 --> 24:27.609
- What are these?
- (Homer) That's it. That's it.

24:27.827 --> 24:30.532
Now, how about you two, uh...

24:30.705 --> 24:33.825
- (Homer) What? Oh. All right, all right.
- Oh, much better.

24:34.208 --> 24:37.079
- How about you two shakin' hands?
- Shaking hands now?

24:37.336 --> 24:40.005
Yeah, shakin' hands over top of the stone.

24:40.214 --> 24:43.250
Come on! It's all in fun.
That's it. Now, smile.

24:44.426 --> 24:46.917
Act like you're enjoyin'
the hell out of this.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.924
- (Thad) Oh, we are.
- For all the world to see.

25:00.858 --> 25:05.567
- (Liz) Are you sorry you did it?
- (Thad) I'm only sorry about two things.

25:05.779 --> 25:08.187
One, we look like a pair of idiots.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.898
What's number two?

25:11.118 --> 25:14.486
(sighs) I just know we can't
hide from publicity any more.

25:14.871 --> 25:17.623
We've had it pretty easy
in that department.

25:17.832 --> 25:21.746
You'll be flavour of the month, they
forget you, then you win the Pulitzer.

25:22.169 --> 25:24.245
- What else? Come on.
- Nothin'.

25:25.589 --> 25:27.795
Honestly?

25:29.551 --> 25:31.757
Honestly.

25:53.740 --> 25:56.527
You gotta be kiddin', pal.
At one in the damn a. m.?

26:02.123 --> 26:04.614
Hey, that looks like...

26:42.202 --> 26:44.360
What the hell...?

26:44.954 --> 26:48.405
The American way of death, Homer.
Without any folderol!

27:15.024 --> 27:20.100
Digger, calm down. I'll get somebody
over right away. Right away.

27:23.490 --> 27:25.779
(clears throat) Digger Holt.

27:25.992 --> 27:27.901
- Seein' ghosts again?
- Yep.

27:28.119 --> 27:30.076
- Hm.
- Where's Norris?

27:30.288 --> 27:32.411
Out on a call.
You want me to track him down?

27:32.623 --> 27:35.458
- (phone rings)
- No. I'll go myself.

27:35.668 --> 27:38.419
- I'll be over at Homeland.
- All right.

27:38.754 --> 27:41.589
I'll be here. Castle Rock Police.

27:59.857 --> 28:01.814
H... here we are, Sheriff.

28:02.026 --> 28:04.398
Don't it look like what I said?

28:04.611 --> 28:08.110
Don't it look like somebody
dug his way out of there?

28:08.615 --> 28:13.028
Like somebody was buried alive
and dug his way out?

28:13.411 --> 28:17.574
Someone dug a hole in your graveyard.
That's all it is, nothin' more.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.365
But somebody was in there, Sheriff.

28:22.211 --> 28:23.871
Look here.

28:24.088 --> 28:28.465
He set his hands in the dirt here
to boost hisself out.

28:28.675 --> 28:32.887
So whoever dug the hole
got down in it to do the diggin'.

28:33.096 --> 28:36.631
You got yourself a clear case
of vandalism. That's the way I see it.

28:36.850 --> 28:40.016
This is where they set up
for that picture in the magazine.

28:40.186 --> 28:44.764
- Yeah. Picture of the Beaumonts. I saw it.
- Well, this here's the Beaumont plot.

28:44.982 --> 28:48.896
And this hole is a-sittin' right smack
where they set up that fake tombstone.

28:49.111 --> 28:51.068
It's just a hole in the ground.

28:51.280 --> 28:55.028
Forget it, Digger.
Fill the damn thing in and forget it.

29:00.747 --> 29:03.997
- Pangborn here.
- Yeah, Sheriff, it's Marty.

29:04.250 --> 29:08.497
Me and Norris just found old Homer
Gamache, deader than a squashed coon.

29:08.712 --> 29:10.669
(siren)

29:33.068 --> 29:36.069
- Jesus!
- Guy across the street saw Homer...

29:36.280 --> 29:39.399
...stop last night to pick up
a hitchhiker about, uh, 1am.

29:39.574 --> 29:42.908
White male.
We figure he popped him for his truck.

29:43.119 --> 29:45.491
We got a description out on it.

29:45.705 --> 29:48.374
He took his leg. He took his damn leg.

29:48.791 --> 29:51.994
No, he didn't take it. It's over there.

29:52.878 --> 29:57.006
That's what he beat him with.
Beat him with his own wooden leg.

29:59.926 --> 30:02.596
He was just an old man,
you son of a bitch.

30:03.430 --> 30:08.175
Why didn't you just clip him one,
take his truck and leave him be?

30:09.852 --> 30:13.802
Why this? I hope I get
a chance to ask you.

30:19.111 --> 30:23.488
I want everybody in the world lookin'
for that truck. I wanna get this fucker.

31:26.423 --> 31:29.044
Ask Mama if she believes this.

31:29.259 --> 31:33.968
He drove it like this? All the way
from Maine, he drove it like this?

31:46.525 --> 31:48.731
Ask Mama if she believes this.

31:56.326 --> 31:58.947
- So, how was it? How was New York?
- Noisy.

32:00.455 --> 32:04.618
God, I'm so sick of the same old
questions, over and over again.

32:04.792 --> 32:08.576
"Tell us about the pencils. "
"Why'd you give him a prison record?"

32:08.796 --> 32:11.168
"Why do you suppose
Machine is so popular?"

32:11.965 --> 32:15.001
- Thanks a lot, Donna.
- You're welcome. They were great.

32:15.177 --> 32:18.960
Listen, I know they're a handful.
Say hi to your mom for me.

32:19.722 --> 32:22.094
- Are you Elizabeth Beaumont?
- Yes.

32:22.850 --> 32:25.555
- Alan?
- Is your husband home, Mrs Beaumont?

32:26.270 --> 32:29.639
Well, yes, he is.
Alan, is there some kind of problem?

32:29.815 --> 32:33.895
It's all right. I know these folks.
We have to talk to Thad, Liz.

32:34.695 --> 32:37.446
Well, sure. Come on in. I'll call him.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.992
Alan. What are you doin' in Ludlow?

32:47.081 --> 32:49.537
Are you Thaddeus Beaumont?

32:49.750 --> 32:51.707
Yeah.

32:53.212 --> 32:55.169
What's goin' on, Alan?

32:55.339 --> 32:58.174
We're here to question you
in connection with a capital crime.

32:58.383 --> 33:01.586
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Jesus, what is this?

33:01.970 --> 33:05.504
You have to right to legal counsel.
If you cannot afford legal counsel...

33:05.723 --> 33:07.467
...such will be provided for you.

33:07.684 --> 33:10.554
I don't know why you're 160 miles
out of your territory...

33:10.728 --> 33:14.097
...lookin' at me like I was birdshit
on a new car, but I'll tell you this:

33:14.315 --> 33:17.481
I won't answer any questions
until you tell me what's goin' on.

33:17.693 --> 33:19.816
It's about Homer Gamache.

33:20.028 --> 33:20.692
Uh...

33:20.904 --> 33:24.189
- Oh, the photographer. What about him?
- He's been murdered.

33:24.407 --> 33:26.732
- Jesus. By who?
- Evidence says you did it.

33:26.993 --> 33:30.777
- This is a... Alan! This is a joke.
- Can you account for your whereabouts...

33:31.164 --> 33:35.078
...during the time period from 11 pm
last Friday until 1am Saturday morning?

33:35.251 --> 33:39.082
Yes. I was in New York.
I just got back today a little while ago.

33:39.296 --> 33:44.290
- (Alan) How long were you there?
- I left Friday, four o'clock out of Bangor.

33:44.718 --> 33:47.339
Anyone meet you there?
Did you do anything that night?

33:47.554 --> 33:52.844
No. I... Let's see. I called my agent, Rick
Cowley, to let him know I was comin' in.

33:53.059 --> 33:55.514
You called him, but you didn't see him.

33:55.728 --> 33:58.894
- You think I'm lying to ya?
- There is that possibility...

33:59.106 --> 34:01.063
...and I've got to consider it.

34:01.275 --> 34:05.936
From what I know about you, you're not
the kind of person to do a thing like this.

34:06.154 --> 34:08.478
None of that counts
when it comes to doin' my job.

34:08.697 --> 34:11.449
Look, call TWA,
or the hotel, Sherry Netherland.

34:11.659 --> 34:13.782
They must have a record
of when I checked in.

34:13.995 --> 34:16.616
(Liz) We haven't been
up to Castle Rock for weeks.

34:16.831 --> 34:19.915
Why are you so determined
to lay this off on Thad?

34:20.167 --> 34:23.536
Because he thinks I did it. He thinks I did...

34:23.712 --> 34:25.254
(twittering)

34:28.759 --> 34:31.214
(Liz) Thad? Are you OK?

34:34.264 --> 34:36.801
Honey, are you all right?

34:36.974 --> 34:39.014
- (twittering subsides)
- Hm?

34:39.226 --> 34:41.184
Are you OK?

34:41.395 --> 34:43.886
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

34:44.690 --> 34:47.062
If this turns out to be a mistake...

34:47.275 --> 34:51.853
...I will personally find the man who
screwed up this ID and pull his skin off.

34:52.072 --> 34:56.864
What ID? What's this evidence you have?
I mean, why? Why me?

34:57.076 --> 35:00.410
First off, there's the connection
between you and Homer.

35:00.621 --> 35:04.370
- (Thad) The pictures.
- One was taken in Homeland Cemetery.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.371
- Yeah. So?
- Someone went there Friday night...

35:07.586 --> 35:09.828
...and dug a hole in your family plot.

35:10.214 --> 35:12.206
A hole big enough to bury a man.

35:12.424 --> 35:14.997
Homer was murdered
less than a mile away.

35:15.427 --> 35:18.048
Look, Thad, this can't be.
Somebody is doing this to...

35:18.263 --> 35:20.551
It's that creep. It's Clawson.

35:21.724 --> 35:24.642
- Who?
- There's this guy, Fred Clawson.

35:24.852 --> 35:28.850
Lives in New York. I don't know where. He
found out I wrote the George Stark books.

35:29.064 --> 35:32.765
He was threatening to blackmail me.
That's why I went public.

35:33.151 --> 35:34.859
We'll ask NYPD to check him out.

35:37.656 --> 35:39.648
What else you got, Alan?

35:39.824 --> 35:45.115
I don't believe you'd track me all the way
here just because of a hole in the ground.

35:45.288 --> 35:47.327
The killer took Homer's pickup truck.

35:47.748 --> 35:51.662
A Connecticut trooper found it in
a used-car lot just north of the state line.

35:51.835 --> 35:56.627
They found fingerprints in the truck,
some of 'em stamped in Homer's blood.

35:57.007 --> 36:01.668
They fed 'em into a graphics computer
and your service record came back.

36:02.762 --> 36:04.968
Your prints match up.

36:05.181 --> 36:07.138
Exactly.

36:34.667 --> 36:38.367
(Elvis Presley)
I wonder if... you're lonesome tonight.

36:39.463 --> 36:44.374
You know, someone said that the world's
a stage, and each of us must play a part.

36:45.719 --> 36:49.170
Fate had me playing in love,
with you as my sweetheart.

36:50.056 --> 36:52.179
Act One was when we met.

36:52.975 --> 36:55.597
I loved you at first glance.

36:55.811 --> 36:57.768
You read your lines so tenderly.

36:59.606 --> 37:01.563
(eerie laughter)

37:01.775 --> 37:06.650
Then came Act Two.
Using the change, you acted strange...

37:06.863 --> 37:08.856
...and why, I'll never know.

37:12.452 --> 37:18.454
(young Thad) Miss Bird said... brightly...

37:23.587 --> 37:26.671
(Stark)
Down here, we call that fool's stuffing.

37:26.882 --> 37:29.373
What do you mean, "down here"?

37:30.093 --> 37:34.137
Endsville, Thad. The place
where all rail service terminates.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.391
(toy squeaks)

37:40.603 --> 37:43.473
You always were the clumsy one,
old Hoss.

37:43.647 --> 37:46.055
Then they can bring the curtain down.

38:04.333 --> 38:06.491
(Stark) I'm not done with you,
cock-knocker.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.415
Remember that.
You don't wanna fuck with me.

38:09.630 --> 38:12.120
Cos when you fuck with me...

38:17.262 --> 38:19.550
...you're fuckin' with the best.

38:51.085 --> 38:54.121
Clawson. There's police here to see you.

38:55.255 --> 38:57.544
Clawson? You owe me two weeks' rent.

38:57.757 --> 39:01.209
If these guys are here to take you away,
I want it now!

39:01.428 --> 39:03.669
Let's check it out.

39:06.641 --> 39:08.633
Jesus! (retches)

40:37.308 --> 40:39.300
(Liz) He's back.

40:41.604 --> 40:44.094
(knocking at door) Thad?

40:47.651 --> 40:49.857
- He's back.
- Who's back?

40:50.111 --> 40:51.819
Alan Pangborn.

40:57.827 --> 41:01.907
I wondered if we could all just
sit down and have a cold one.

41:02.665 --> 41:04.289
No.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.457
Yeah. I'll have one.

41:08.795 --> 41:10.871
I have no business bein' here...

41:11.089 --> 41:16.794
...socialisin' with a man who is now
a suspect in not just one murder...

41:17.011 --> 41:19.300
...but two.

41:19.472 --> 41:22.971
- Two?
- Yeah. Your buddy. Frederick Clawson.

41:23.184 --> 41:24.512
- (Liz) God!
- When?

41:24.685 --> 41:29.311
Night before last.
In New York, while you were still there.

41:30.566 --> 41:33.769
Night, uh... night before last.
Night before last, I was at...

41:33.985 --> 41:37.520
You were at a press reception
till about 11 o'clock.

41:37.697 --> 41:40.270
We think Clawson was killed
around nine or ten...

41:40.491 --> 41:43.029
...but it could have been
as late as midnight.

41:43.202 --> 41:46.737
We got another set of fingerprints
out of Clawson's apartment.

41:46.956 --> 41:49.873
Once again, they match yours exactly.

41:50.084 --> 41:52.491
Christ! What is going on, Thad?

41:52.711 --> 41:56.162
Well, I'm surprised you brought beer,
not handcuffs.

41:56.381 --> 41:59.050
- What's keepin' me outta jail?
- Me, I guess.

41:59.259 --> 42:02.425
New York guys think
you should be brought in.

42:02.637 --> 42:05.721
- Why are you lettin' me off the hook?
- I'm not.

42:06.098 --> 42:08.885
You're still very much on the hook, Thad.

42:09.101 --> 42:12.268
And if you killed these people,
I'm gonna pull you in the boat.

42:12.479 --> 42:16.726
I figure you're not goin' anywhere.
Hard for a man like you to hide.

42:16.942 --> 42:20.773
I'm willin' to let you sleep at home
while I work on this some more.

42:20.987 --> 42:23.276
Meanwhile you build a case
to beat my alibis.

42:23.490 --> 42:27.736
I'm not tryin' to beat your alibis
any more than I'm tryin' to prove 'em.

42:27.952 --> 42:31.996
I was so sure it was Clawson.
Well, suppose he killed himself.

42:32.289 --> 42:37.034
- He could make that look like Thad did it.
- The way he died, that's impossible.

42:37.252 --> 42:41.166
Did anybody else know that
you and Clawson were connected?

42:41.381 --> 42:45.165
Clawson got his information from
someone who works for my publisher.

42:45.385 --> 42:49.845
That's all he told me. I don't have a name.
You mentioned the way he was killed.

42:50.056 --> 42:52.891
Yeah. It looked like a, uh,
classic gangland hit.

42:53.059 --> 42:56.593
- Shot?
- No, no. You don't shoot a blabbermouth.

42:56.812 --> 42:59.267
You make him bleed. Make him suffer.

42:59.481 --> 43:01.474
Clawson's tongue was cut out.

43:01.650 --> 43:05.730
He was castrated
and his penis stuffed into his mouth.

43:05.945 --> 43:10.488
That's exactly what I said
I wanted to do to him. I was joking.

43:10.867 --> 43:14.781
I said if I was Alexis Machine,
that's exactly what I would do.

43:15.663 --> 43:18.913
That's a character in one of his books.
Alexis Machine.

43:19.750 --> 43:22.122
It was a joke.

43:22.711 --> 43:26.411
Come on, Alan. Would I admit
that to you if I killed the guy?

43:31.094 --> 43:34.379
There was somethin'
written on the wall at Clawson's.

43:34.597 --> 43:37.467
Written in the victim's blood.

43:37.683 --> 43:39.925
"The sparrows are flying again. "

43:40.853 --> 43:43.972
Does that mean anything to either of you?

43:44.231 --> 43:46.354
- No.
- Thad?

43:46.566 --> 43:48.773
No.

43:53.781 --> 43:55.774
You're sure?

43:55.992 --> 43:58.447
Doesn't mean a th... thing.

44:02.831 --> 44:06.911
(Liz) You're keepin' secrets, Thad.
That's no good. It never was.

44:07.169 --> 44:10.123
Some psychotic out there
has killed two people that we know...

44:10.338 --> 44:12.746
...and has somehow
made it look like you did it.

44:12.966 --> 44:15.254
This guy's obviously out to get you.

44:16.135 --> 44:19.006
I mean, have you considered
that you might be in danger?

44:19.222 --> 44:22.175
That all of us might be next
on this guy's hit list?

44:22.391 --> 44:25.926
Now, come on, Thad. This is not
a good time to be holdin' things back.

44:26.103 --> 44:28.594
No, it's not a good time.

44:30.774 --> 44:33.063
The sparrows are flying again.

44:33.944 --> 44:36.814
It means something to you. What is it?

44:44.286 --> 44:46.493
Oh, Thad. What is goin' on?

44:47.373 --> 44:49.579
There's more.

44:50.584 --> 44:53.917
I wrote those words
and I don't remember doing it.

44:55.213 --> 44:57.965
I was in some kind of... trance.

44:59.300 --> 45:03.049
The tumour I had when I was a boy.
I told you about the headaches it caused.

45:03.471 --> 45:06.044
- Did I ever tell you about the sounds?
- Sounds? No.

45:06.223 --> 45:11.597
People with brain tumours sometimes
have symptoms, sensory precursors.

45:12.604 --> 45:18.060
They smell things, hear things, that
aren't actually there. I used to hear birds.

45:19.736 --> 45:22.309
I've started hearing them again.

45:24.198 --> 45:29.074
Thad, you have to go and see the doctor.
Maybe you have another tumour.

45:29.286 --> 45:32.453
That would explain the sounds.
But what about the rest of it?

45:32.665 --> 45:35.665
Liz, I blanked out
for an entire period of time.

45:37.461 --> 45:41.838
I wrote those words,
and I have no recollection of doing it.

45:42.799 --> 45:45.716
I mean,
what if there are other things I've done?

45:45.927 --> 45:50.007
What if there are other things I've done...
that I can't remember?

46:01.149 --> 46:05.147
Thad! I'm delighted to see that
they haven't incarcerated you.

46:05.361 --> 46:07.484
Sounds like the police have been in touch.

46:07.697 --> 46:11.030
They wanted me to confirm that
you were a man of good character.

46:11.242 --> 46:13.697
I lied, and told them that you were.

46:15.246 --> 46:18.697
- Are you in trouble, Thad?
- I'm in somethin'.

46:18.916 --> 46:21.241
Just a mix-up, I think, but it's got me goin'.

46:21.668 --> 46:23.625
Any way I can help?

46:25.547 --> 46:29.876
There's some weird shit goin' on. I could
use some help from an old witch doctor.

46:30.093 --> 46:34.304
- Come, let's talk.
- I can't, Reggie. I'm... scrambled. I...

46:34.513 --> 46:36.720
- Call if you need me.
- I will.

46:37.391 --> 46:39.384
Thanks.

46:51.112 --> 46:53.069
(twittering)

46:53.281 --> 46:55.273
(wings fluttering)

47:41.409 --> 47:43.033
(whispers) Endsville...

47:44.036 --> 47:45.696
...for ever.

49:31.010 --> 49:34.177
Oh! Oh! Oh! No! No!

49:37.558 --> 49:39.550
No! No! No!

49:41.770 --> 49:44.557
Shut up, or I'll have to cut you, sis.

49:46.816 --> 49:49.438
- What do you want?
- What'd I just say?

49:51.070 --> 49:54.984
Now, you're gonna make us
a little telephone call, sissy.

50:02.831 --> 50:05.452
(chuckles) No.
I know what you're thinking.

50:05.667 --> 50:10.744
You're thinking you could brain me with
that thing. Not a very happy thought.

50:11.047 --> 50:14.795
You know what happens to people
who lose their happy thoughts? Hm?

50:15.218 --> 50:17.009
No!

50:17.303 --> 50:18.963
Argh!

50:21.807 --> 50:24.298
They fall out of the sky.

50:27.896 --> 50:29.972
Now...

50:30.524 --> 50:33.014
We're gonna call us Thad Beaumont.

50:37.989 --> 50:41.903
- W... what do I say?
- Oh, you'll think of something.

50:42.118 --> 50:44.952
(Thad) Hi.
We can't come to the phone right now...

50:45.162 --> 50:48.163
...but if you leave your name
and number at the beep...

50:48.582 --> 50:51.251
...we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

50:57.090 --> 50:59.082
Sh.

51:00.885 --> 51:04.633
Tell him who you are
and what's happenin' here.

51:04.847 --> 51:07.931
Do it. Don't make me tell you twice.

51:10.185 --> 51:12.937
Do it, or I'll cut
your fuckin' head off with this thing.

51:13.146 --> 51:17.060
Thad! Thad, there's... there's a...

51:17.275 --> 51:21.486
- Say your name.
... man here, there's a bad man here.

51:21.696 --> 51:23.938
- Say your name.
- Miriam.

51:24.156 --> 51:28.818
Please help me! There's a man here.
Please don't let him cut me any more!

51:36.168 --> 51:38.374
(phone rings)

51:41.131 --> 51:43.538
Pangborns... Sure.

51:43.841 --> 51:45.501
Hey, Dad! Phone!

51:49.764 --> 51:52.254
Turn it down a little, son.

51:54.852 --> 51:56.595
- Yeah.
- It's Thad Beaumont.

51:56.770 --> 52:00.103
- A lady in New York needs help fast.
- Go ahead. Shoot.

52:00.523 --> 52:03.773
Miriam Cowley. My agent's ex-wife.
She called here. I wasn't home.

52:03.985 --> 52:07.318
I got a recording on my machine.
And I heard a man's voice.

52:07.530 --> 52:10.400
She said he was threatening to hurt her,
uh, to cut her.

52:10.574 --> 52:12.982
She begged me
not to let him do that again.

52:13.202 --> 52:16.037
I tried to call her back,
but couldn't get through.

52:16.246 --> 52:18.737
- What's the address?
- 109 West 84th.

52:18.915 --> 52:21.750
I was gonna call the New York police.

52:21.960 --> 52:26.456
No, you did the right thing.
I'll call 'em. I can cut through the shit.

52:28.466 --> 52:30.921
Give me a break here, son.

52:37.516 --> 52:39.888
- Problem?
- Yep.

52:40.477 --> 52:42.968
- Bad?
- Well, we can hope.

52:49.819 --> 52:51.313
This is Alan Pangborn...

52:57.993 --> 52:59.701
(phone rings)

52:59.870 --> 53:02.112
Yeah? Yeah, hello?

53:03.165 --> 53:05.157
Oh, God.

53:09.587 --> 53:12.043
Miriam's dead.

53:16.969 --> 53:21.595
Alan, I think there might be
some other people that are in danger.

53:22.808 --> 53:27.968
Rick Cowley. I'm sure he's gonna go
after Rick. Now, he lives at 129 East 68th.

53:28.188 --> 53:30.975
And, uh, the guy that wrote that article.

53:31.149 --> 53:33.640
He'll probably go after him.
Mike Donaldson.

53:33.860 --> 53:36.232
He lives in New York too,
but I'm not sure where.

53:36.446 --> 53:39.197
What do you know
that you're not tellin' me?

53:39.407 --> 53:41.897
I think I know who's doing these things.

53:42.076 --> 53:44.364
- Give him to me.
- Not over the phone.

53:44.787 --> 53:47.112
- Can you get here tomorrow?
- I need to know tonight.

53:47.289 --> 53:49.198
Can't we do it tomorrow, face to face?

53:49.374 --> 53:53.870
Look, I've been tryin' to cut you
every break I can. Don't stretch my limit.

53:56.839 --> 53:59.128
I can give you a description.

54:00.801 --> 54:03.126
I'm not entirely sure it's right...

54:05.222 --> 54:07.511
...but I think it's close.

54:11.186 --> 54:15.018
He's about my size,
blue eyes, same as mine.

54:16.316 --> 54:21.606
Hair slicked back. About my age.
In better shape, though. Strong, muscular.

54:22.071 --> 54:27.148
He lives in Oxford, Mississippi,
and he's got a little bit of a cracker accent.

54:28.202 --> 54:30.775
He might be driving...

54:30.996 --> 54:35.124
...an old black Toronado. It's got
a lot of blasting power under the hood.

54:35.333 --> 54:38.251
It's got letters on the back.
"High Toned Son Of A Bitch".

54:38.461 --> 54:41.082
You can tell me all this,
but not who the guy is?

54:41.256 --> 54:43.793
Knowing his name tonight
isn't gonna help.

54:44.217 --> 54:47.087
He's probably using
the name of George Stark.

55:08.364 --> 55:10.356
Huh? Oh.

55:10.991 --> 55:12.984
Shit!

55:24.963 --> 55:27.169
Goddamn city.

55:42.312 --> 55:44.269
(footsteps)

55:57.951 --> 55:59.909
Oh, no.

56:00.871 --> 56:03.113
(metallic click)

56:04.374 --> 56:06.367
(whistling)

56:08.420 --> 56:10.377
(baby cries)

56:40.699 --> 56:42.656
Ow!

56:43.619 --> 56:45.944
Argh!

56:46.204 --> 56:47.829
Hello, Mike.

56:48.999 --> 56:50.659
Goodbye, Mike.

56:57.298 --> 56:59.587
Ah, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

57:09.267 --> 57:11.675
Somebody help!

57:17.358 --> 57:19.434
- What's going on?
- Murder.

57:20.444 --> 57:22.770
D'you want some?

57:27.409 --> 57:30.327
Whoops! Well, I guess I'd better punt.

57:35.250 --> 57:37.705
(clears throat)

57:45.343 --> 57:47.833
(whistles "Are you Lonesome Tonight?")

57:57.229 --> 58:00.977
- What the hell is that down there?
- I don't know. Got your flashlight?

58:01.274 --> 58:04.607
- Oh, look at this. Jesus fucking Christ.
- You think this is the guy?

58:04.819 --> 58:08.022
- Is this the fuckin' guy...
- How the fuck do I know, huh?

58:08.197 --> 58:10.984
- Christ!
- Oh, this is really some shit, man.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.525
- Hey. Hey!
- Forget about it.

58:13.786 --> 58:16.158
- Who the hell is that?
- I don't know. He's gone.

58:16.371 --> 58:18.364
Oh, look at this shit.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.574
(phone ringing)

58:33.137 --> 58:35.509
- Hello.
- (Stark) Good mornin', Rick.

58:35.722 --> 58:38.759
This is the man who cut
your woman's throat.

58:39.434 --> 58:41.640
What?

58:41.937 --> 58:45.804
- Who are you?
- Ask Thad Beaumont who I am.

58:45.982 --> 58:50.478
He knows all about it. Tell him
I said you were walkin' around dead...

58:50.653 --> 58:53.523
...and tell him I'm not done
makin' fool's stuffing yet.

58:53.739 --> 58:55.862
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Who are you?

58:56.075 --> 58:58.363
(Stark hangs up)

59:00.495 --> 59:02.951
Oh, God! God!

59:31.774 --> 59:33.767
Have a good one, man.

59:34.068 --> 59:37.935
Jesus Christ! You asshole!

59:38.405 --> 59:40.647
Fuck you!

59:45.704 --> 59:49.452
(Alan) So tell me, Thad.
Who do you think is doin' this?

59:49.624 --> 59:52.115
- Give me a name.
- I gave you a name.

59:52.585 --> 59:54.542
The name is George Stark.

59:55.213 --> 01:00:00.005
- I don't think I understand you.
- What my husband is trying to say...

01:00:00.217 --> 01:00:03.966
...is that he thinks George Stark
has somehow come to life.

01:00:04.638 --> 01:00:09.430
Now, look, Alan, I don't expect you to be
the type of guy to believe this, but, um...

01:00:09.643 --> 01:00:11.719
...you're all we've got right now.

01:00:11.937 --> 01:00:14.344
Thad has some things he's gonna tell you.

01:00:14.731 --> 01:00:18.775
You don't have to believe him,
but you have to trust that he believes.

01:00:18.985 --> 01:00:23.445
Because if you don't, this man,
or whatever he is, is gonna go on killing...

01:00:23.656 --> 01:00:28.198
...and he's gonna keep on killing till
he gets to me and Thad and the babies.

01:01:05.903 --> 01:01:09.603
You don't believe it, do you?
Not a single word of it.

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:13.406
If you'd told me these people
were murdered by a ghost...

01:01:13.619 --> 01:01:15.576
...I wouldn't believe ya.

01:01:15.787 --> 01:01:19.322
But I can come closer
to believin' a ghost story than this.

01:01:19.541 --> 01:01:24.119
You're not just talkin' about a ghost,
you're talkin' about a man who never was.

01:01:24.337 --> 01:01:26.792
Maybe you'd like to tell me
where this guy came from.

01:01:27.006 --> 01:01:31.668
Did you just give birth to him one night?
Did he pop out of a damn sparrow's egg?

01:01:32.469 --> 01:01:34.462
Exactly how did it go?

01:01:34.638 --> 01:01:37.841
I don't know when
he became a separate person.

01:01:40.894 --> 01:01:43.100
It was when we tried to kill him.

01:01:43.354 --> 01:01:47.815
Look, I'm willing to consider
all sorts of crazy possibilities here.

01:01:48.025 --> 01:01:51.062
But when you tell me
this guy is George Stark...

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.816
He might think he's George Stark,
I'll give you that.

01:01:55.991 --> 01:01:58.031
But he's not. He can't be.

01:01:58.493 --> 01:02:00.700
He's a crazy man, Thad.

01:02:00.912 --> 01:02:04.661
A goddamn homicidal
lunatic crazy man is what he is.

01:02:06.209 --> 01:02:08.960
And I'm gonna catch him.

01:02:19.763 --> 01:02:23.891
Hold it, Mr Cowley. The guys from
communications are supposed to be here.

01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:26.971
- Maybe they're inside.
- One should be right out here.

01:02:27.187 --> 01:02:30.104
It's standard procedure. Come on.

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:59.208
- Maybe they never showed up.
- Let's try 'em on the radio.

01:02:59.467 --> 01:03:02.966
- Where they comin' from? Downtown?
- I don't know. Call the precinct.

01:03:03.178 --> 01:03:05.385
Look, I gotta get some sleep. I'm dead.

01:03:05.597 --> 01:03:09.429
- We'll be here.
- Maybe we'll send out for Chinese later.

01:03:09.643 --> 01:03:11.801
- My treat.
- Thanks.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.286
Jesus Christ!

01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:40.999
I've decided to change agents.

01:03:41.213 --> 01:03:44.962
I'm sorry, Rick. It's a cutthroat business.

01:04:05.528 --> 01:04:07.935
(Thad) God! Oh, Jesus. Rick...

01:04:10.032 --> 01:04:12.439
Rick is gone. I don't believe this.

01:04:12.618 --> 01:04:17.694
I can't believe this. I mean, so much
for your fucking police protection!

01:04:19.582 --> 01:04:22.156
(Thad) Oh, bullshit! Bullshit!

01:04:22.794 --> 01:04:26.162
They didn't! No, they didn't!
I don't care what you think.

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:29.500
You wanna think about something?
Think about what I told you.

01:04:29.717 --> 01:04:32.468
Think about George Stark.
Think about that!

01:04:32.636 --> 01:04:34.214
What does he want?

01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:39.305
He wants the same thing you and I would
want if we were in the same position.

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:41.967
He doesn't wanna be dead any more!

01:04:50.778 --> 01:04:53.732
Jesus. Rick... Miriam.

01:04:55.616 --> 01:04:57.655
Who's next?

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:02.576
I, uh... I think that's everything,
Mr Beaumont.

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:06.537
We'll call from the outside
to make sure the system's working.

01:05:06.751 --> 01:05:08.743
OK, fine. Thank you.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.999
(phone rings)

01:05:11.672 --> 01:05:16.749
We don't have to make a test call. Pull
your meter. I'll check it out in the cellar.

01:05:32.483 --> 01:05:34.939
Somebody gonna answer it?

01:05:36.445 --> 01:05:38.853
Mr Beaumont?

01:05:39.073 --> 01:05:41.742
- Something the matter?
- It's him.

01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:44.441
It's who?

01:05:46.621 --> 01:05:48.744
What do you want, you son of a bitch?

01:05:48.957 --> 01:05:52.491
(Stark) Cool down, Thad.
No need to get your panties all in a bunch.

01:05:52.794 --> 01:05:55.629
- What do you want?
- To tell you it's over.

01:05:55.796 --> 01:06:00.458
I got the last one this noontime. Little girl
who used to work for your publisher.

01:06:00.884 --> 01:06:04.419
The cops'll find her. Some of her is
on the floor. The rest is on the table.

01:06:04.638 --> 01:06:06.677
Jesus Christ!

01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.262
I'm gonna head down south
and do me some fishin'.

01:06:09.476 --> 01:06:12.512
- This city life's tirin' me out.
- He's lying.

01:06:12.729 --> 01:06:16.180
- You lying fuck.
- Why, Thad, that's not very nice.

01:06:16.524 --> 01:06:20.391
Did you think I was gonna hurt you? Hell,
no. I was gettin' revenge for you, boy.

01:06:20.694 --> 01:06:23.066
You knew all along
I was the one that had to do it.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.613
- You got a chicken liver.
- He's lying. He knows you're listening.

01:06:26.825 --> 01:06:29.826
I'm not gonna bother you any more, Thad.

01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:34.239
I know you're gonna come after us,
George.

01:06:34.415 --> 01:06:36.906
I know you're gonna come after me.

01:06:37.668 --> 01:06:40.159
And I think I know what you want.

01:06:40.504 --> 01:06:42.164
Well, you just come ahead.

01:06:42.381 --> 01:06:44.587
I'll know you're comin'.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:47.469
- I'll know because I'll hear the birds.
- Birds?

01:06:47.678 --> 01:06:50.678
That's right.
I'll hear the birds, and I'll be waitin'.

01:06:50.931 --> 01:06:52.840
Waitin' to fuckin' take you apart.

01:06:53.058 --> 01:06:56.391
- Dear God!
- You're talkin' crazy, Thad. What birds?

01:06:56.561 --> 01:06:58.684
Sparrows. Don't you hear the sparrows?

01:06:58.896 --> 01:07:03.973
Well, whatever you're talkin' about
doesn't matter, because... this is over.

01:07:04.193 --> 01:07:06.150
(hangs up)

01:07:11.825 --> 01:07:14.577
- Clear as a bell.
- Let's check the van.

01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:21.155
The call was made from
a payphone in Times Square.

01:07:21.334 --> 01:07:25.663
They're checkin' to see if the voice
might have been a tape recording.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.121
What, made by me?

01:07:28.757 --> 01:07:32.292
Your calling-card number
was used to pay for the call.

01:07:33.553 --> 01:07:36.554
Jesus. After all this, I'm still a suspect.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:40.556
Look, I know they can't hang
last night's work on you. You were here.

01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:45.181
- But they think you have an accomplice.
- That is the craziest thing I ever heard!

01:07:45.398 --> 01:07:47.889
I wish I could say the same thing, Thad.

01:07:49.568 --> 01:07:52.024
You gave me a description, remember?

01:07:52.446 --> 01:07:56.989
The witness at Donaldson's says the killer
matches that description perfectly.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:59.738
You told me
he was driving a black Toronado.

01:07:59.911 --> 01:08:05.036
The place where they found Homer's
pick-up says it was stolen off their lot.

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:11.833
That and the fingerprints. And you named
the victims before they were killed.

01:08:12.256 --> 01:08:16.040
I mean, Jesus Christ, man.
What do you expect people to think?

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:20.127
- What do you think, Alan?
- I think some psycho's got it in for you.

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:22.760
Somebody clever enough
to go diggin' around...

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:26.473
...to find out things he could use
to make you look guilty.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.844
It's either that or it's you, Thad.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:32.514
It could be that somehow
you are behind all this.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:35.484
Don't think I've written that possibility off.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:37.651
Well, you'd better write it off.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:41.066
Stop looking at me
and start lookin' over your shoulder.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:44.568
It could be real unhealthy
for you if you don't.

01:09:01.093 --> 01:09:04.792
- How ya doin', Mr Beaumont?
- Uh, I've been better, Rosalie.

01:09:05.013 --> 01:09:07.255
Been better.

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.053
(phone rings)

01:09:17.524 --> 01:09:19.517
(Rosalie) Hello?

01:09:21.862 --> 01:09:24.104
It's for you, Mr Beaumont.

01:09:31.537 --> 01:09:34.871
- Hello, George.
- (Stark) Thad. How's it hangin'?

01:09:35.041 --> 01:09:37.366
- What do you want?
- You know the answer to that.

01:09:37.585 --> 01:09:41.712
You figured it out, and figured right.
It's time to start a new book.

01:09:41.921 --> 01:09:46.002
Oh, I don't think so. I'm finished with you.
George Stark is dead.

01:09:46.218 --> 01:09:49.384
(chuckles) I'm not dead, Hoss. Not hardly.

01:09:49.595 --> 01:09:54.970
I'm just gettin' started. You better do
what I say or I'll be comin' for ya.

01:09:55.185 --> 01:09:58.933
You will die like no other man
on earth has ever died before.

01:09:59.814 --> 01:10:03.432
Start another book, boy.
Go home and sharpen your pencils.

01:10:03.651 --> 01:10:05.643
(hangs up)

01:10:23.961 --> 01:10:26.119
- Any calls?
- None that matter.

01:10:26.338 --> 01:10:28.082
I'll be over home.

01:10:39.934 --> 01:10:42.140
(whistles)

01:11:26.728 --> 01:11:28.767
(clears throat)

01:11:29.146 --> 01:11:31.637
(rewinds answering machine)

01:11:34.276 --> 01:11:35.984
(beep)

01:11:36.195 --> 01:11:39.610
(man) Hm. Guess I'll have to
call you back, Sheriff.

01:11:43.618 --> 01:11:45.824
(beep)

01:11:46.538 --> 01:11:48.495
Oh, God.

01:11:48.706 --> 01:11:50.995
Oh, Jesus, Annie. I'm sorry.

01:11:51.876 --> 01:11:54.877
- Darlin', I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

01:11:56.547 --> 01:12:00.627
God. I didn't realise
how jumpy I've been gettin'.

01:12:01.426 --> 01:12:03.882
This Beaumont business.

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:06.922
What's he like? Beaumont.

01:12:09.601 --> 01:12:12.436
How do you know?
How do you ever know?

01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:45.754
I'm taking him to work. Maybe you should
send another unit out to watch the house.

01:13:00.064 --> 01:13:03.100
Come on.
Come on, get over here. That's good.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.269
Here. (squeezes squeaky toy)

01:13:06.445 --> 01:13:09.814
Look, if you can't...
Look, this is your favourite toy.

01:13:10.032 --> 01:13:12.107
Would you... would you guys please...

01:13:12.325 --> 01:13:15.528
Just please be...
Would you guys please shut up?

01:13:53.989 --> 01:13:55.946
I'll be a coupla hours.

01:13:56.324 --> 01:13:59.195
- You want some coffee?
- I've got my thermos.

01:14:30.439 --> 01:14:32.432
Let me in, George.

01:14:33.567 --> 01:14:36.058
Come on, George.
Let me come visit for a while.

01:14:36.278 --> 01:14:38.650
Let me see what the hell you're up to.

01:14:40.449 --> 01:14:42.939
Come on, George. Let me in.

01:14:56.046 --> 01:14:58.003
Oh, God.

01:15:24.156 --> 01:15:25.982
They're real.

01:15:26.157 --> 01:15:28.731
The sparrows are real.

01:15:30.662 --> 01:15:32.868
(eerie twittering)

01:16:05.652 --> 01:16:09.068
Why... do you want to write again?

01:16:19.832 --> 01:16:22.121
Why do you say that?

01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:32.083
Falling apart?

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:36.470
Falling... apart.

01:16:37.724 --> 01:16:39.681
How?

01:16:40.685 --> 01:16:42.808
How must we fall?

01:16:43.562 --> 01:16:46.931
Tell me... why, George.

01:16:52.904 --> 01:16:54.897
What?

01:17:16.259 --> 01:17:18.133
Agh!

01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:33.728
(Stark) Smarts, don't it, Thad?

01:17:35.569 --> 01:17:38.024
Hurts like a real son of a bitch.

01:17:39.573 --> 01:17:42.063
I sure hope you can take it, Hoss.

01:17:46.329 --> 01:17:48.321
Now...

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:54.206
Take it like a man.

01:17:57.714 --> 01:17:59.671
Oh, yeah.

01:18:14.396 --> 01:18:16.685
Like a man.

01:18:28.743 --> 01:18:30.700
Agh.

01:18:32.205 --> 01:18:34.411
Agh.

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:38.618
Agh.

01:18:58.437 --> 01:19:01.189
- Where are you going?
- Bangor.

01:19:01.398 --> 01:19:04.150
- What's in Bangor?
- I don't know. Maybe nothing.

01:19:04.318 --> 01:19:07.769
- It's where I had surgery as a boy.
- Here. Take these.

01:19:07.988 --> 01:19:10.229
A disguise.

01:19:12.909 --> 01:19:15.115
A changed man. Car key.

01:19:15.370 --> 01:19:19.367
I hope you'll have the decency to stand
good for any repairs if it gets wounded.

01:19:19.582 --> 01:19:22.748
- How will you get home?
- A cab, I imagine.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.207
I'll get a receipt and present it
to you at the proper moment.

01:19:27.422 --> 01:19:31.254
- Thanks, old friend.
- Thank you for bringing adventure.

01:19:32.719 --> 01:19:36.586
Just for fun, see if you can find
anything in your books about sparrows.

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:39.012
Sparrows?

01:19:39.725 --> 01:19:41.718
Sparrows...

01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:47.762
There is something about sparrows.

01:20:38.822 --> 01:20:39.687
(Thad) A twin?

01:20:40.532 --> 01:20:41.907
They never told you?

01:20:42.075 --> 01:20:44.613
No. No, they said it was a tumour.

01:20:46.245 --> 01:20:49.780
Well... in a way, that's all it was.

01:20:50.916 --> 01:20:54.285
Foreign matter that happened
to wind up in your head.

01:20:55.504 --> 01:20:59.288
I don't see anything, Thad,
but if you're hearing things again...

01:20:59.508 --> 01:21:02.045
...we'd better shoot some pictures.

01:21:02.886 --> 01:21:05.293
A great many of us start out as twins.

01:21:05.513 --> 01:21:08.348
At least one in ten, probably more.

01:21:08.558 --> 01:21:13.931
The stronger fetus absorbs the weaker
and comes to birth as a single child.

01:21:14.647 --> 01:21:19.522
In your case,
the fetus wasn't completely absorbed...

01:21:20.068 --> 01:21:23.188
...and it had to be removed surgically.

01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:27.480
Your mom and dad were
pretty rattled by the whole thing.

01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:32.527
They insisted that the excised tissue
be treated as human remains...

01:21:32.747 --> 01:21:34.739
...and signed over to them.

01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:37.578
- They wanted to bury it.
- Bury it.

01:21:37.793 --> 01:21:41.043
In Homeland Cemetery, in the family plot.

01:21:41.255 --> 01:21:43.247
Don't know.

01:21:45.675 --> 01:21:48.711
- They ever tell you about the sparrows?
- The sparrows?

01:21:48.928 --> 01:21:52.463
It was the damnedest thing.
We'd just finished your surgery...

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:57.801
...when this enormous flock of sparrows,
thousands of them...

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.772
...came swarming down onto the hospital.

01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:03.139
They never figured out
what the hell it was.

01:22:03.358 --> 01:22:05.683
Some kind of migration or something.

01:22:05.902 --> 01:22:10.529
Made a hell of a mess. Windows broke.
Three or four people got hurt.

01:22:11.908 --> 01:22:14.695
You're... bleeding pretty good there.

01:22:16.245 --> 01:22:18.736
Let me put a proper dressing on that.

01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:23.662
- What did you say it was? A cut?
- Oh, uh...

01:22:26.505 --> 01:22:29.078
No, I, uh... poked myself.

01:22:32.218 --> 01:22:34.709
It'll stick in my mind for ever.

01:22:34.929 --> 01:22:37.598
You complaining about
those bird sounds, and...

01:22:37.765 --> 01:22:40.303
...us getting hit by those sparrows.

01:22:41.102 --> 01:22:43.889
It was like we took
the sound out of your head...

01:22:44.063 --> 01:22:46.304
...and it... came to life.

01:22:48.734 --> 01:22:50.940
Howdy, Doc. Remember me?

01:23:41.574 --> 01:23:43.780
(car horn)

01:23:58.465 --> 01:24:00.422
Jesus!

01:24:06.514 --> 01:24:08.969
You bastard.

01:24:09.392 --> 01:24:10.387
Jesus.

01:24:10.559 --> 01:24:12.801
(phone ringing)

01:24:16.982 --> 01:24:19.817
- Hello?
- You gotta get out of there right now.

01:24:19.985 --> 01:24:23.899
- Thad? What are you talk...
- He's here. Stark is here in Bangor.

01:24:24.114 --> 01:24:26.901
That's 20 minutes away.
Get the hell out of there now.

01:24:27.116 --> 01:24:30.817
- What are you doing in Bangor?
- Liz, please! Just listen to me.

01:24:31.037 --> 01:24:35.116
Get out of there, all right?
There's no time. He's killed Doc Pritchard.

01:24:35.457 --> 01:24:39.325
- He's gonna come after you and the kids.
- All right. All right, we'll go.

01:24:39.628 --> 01:24:42.831
- No, promise me. Promise me.
- I promise you we'll go. We'll go now.

01:24:43.048 --> 01:24:45.206
Don't pack anything. Just get the hell out.

01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:47.417
Wait. How do I get in touch with you?

01:24:47.594 --> 01:24:49.633
Through the school. Just, um...

01:24:49.846 --> 01:24:53.214
Uh, Reggie. Don't tell her
where you're going or where you are.

01:24:53.432 --> 01:24:56.884
Tell her you're safe. Don't tell anyone
who might tell me where you are.

01:24:57.102 --> 01:24:59.510
I can't know. Do you understand me?

01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:03.598
- I cannot know where you are.
- All right, we'll go.

01:25:04.901 --> 01:25:06.858
I love you, Liz.

01:25:07.696 --> 01:25:10.483
I love you. I love you more than anything.

01:25:12.867 --> 01:25:15.358
- I love you.
- (Thad hangs up)

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:29.335
OK, listen.
Mommy's gonna take you on a little ride...

01:25:31.676 --> 01:25:33.135
Shit.

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:38.885
I got a despatch. Code six.

01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:47.679
Uh, there's been, uh...

01:25:48.358 --> 01:25:50.849
You better call an ambulance. There's...

01:25:51.069 --> 01:25:54.319
- Ambulance?
- Call an ambulance.

01:25:56.449 --> 01:26:00.114
For God's sakes, we're in danger here,
Alan. My babies are in danger.

01:26:00.328 --> 01:26:04.242
I can't let you just go runnin' off.
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't let you.

01:26:04.456 --> 01:26:08.833
- But Stark could be out there.
- There is no George Stark, Elizabeth.

01:26:09.044 --> 01:26:12.210
- He doesn't exist.
- Somebody exists. Thad said he saw him.

01:26:12.422 --> 01:26:17.380
I don't give a damn what Thad said. Your
husband ought to be in the county jail...

01:26:17.552 --> 01:26:22.297
...and I'm startin' to feel like a damn idiot
for not puttin' him there a long time ago.

01:26:22.473 --> 01:26:25.046
You're just gonna have to
sit tight and ride this out.

01:26:25.267 --> 01:26:28.683
Nothing is going to happen.
You're under police protection.

01:26:29.104 --> 01:26:32.971
- Am I under protection, or under arrest?
- You call it what you like.

01:26:33.275 --> 01:26:35.682
I'm sorry, Liz.
I've been way too soft on this thing.

01:26:35.902 --> 01:26:39.900
I've gotta start goin' by the book.
Now let me talk to the officer there.

01:26:41.658 --> 01:26:44.113
He wants to talk to you.

01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:47.653
- Yes, sir?
- Just hold the fort there, son.

01:26:47.872 --> 01:26:52.699
I'll have two units out to replace you
before nightfall. Keep your eyes open.

01:26:53.085 --> 01:26:57.581
If Thad Beaumont shows up, you pull
him in on suspicion... Murder one.

01:26:57.964 --> 01:27:00.455
Yes, sir. Got it covered, sir.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:14.185
I think the absorbed fetus was merely
a vessel, a stolen body, if you like.

01:27:14.354 --> 01:27:18.897
It just happened to be there,
wholly by accident, and Stark used it.

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:23.112
He took it for his own.
Stark is a conjuration...

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:27.484
...an entity created by
the force of your will.

01:27:28.075 --> 01:27:32.073
We all have something
of the beast inside us.

01:27:32.288 --> 01:27:35.407
We can either suppress it or encourage it.

01:27:35.624 --> 01:27:38.293
In your case, you encouraged it too much.

01:27:38.502 --> 01:27:41.419
In your subconscious,
you wanted it to live.

01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:45.045
You wanted it so badly,
it actually came to be.

01:27:46.176 --> 01:27:49.840
Your characters have always
been vividly written, Thad.

01:27:50.972 --> 01:27:53.130
I wanted him to live.

01:27:55.643 --> 01:27:58.264
God forgive me, it's true.

01:27:58.479 --> 01:28:01.314
A part of me has always
admired George Stark.

01:28:01.481 --> 01:28:04.151
Admired his simple, violent nature.

01:28:04.818 --> 01:28:09.195
A man who doesn't stumble over things,
who never looks weak or silly.

01:28:09.781 --> 01:28:12.947
A man with a straight,
sharp answer for everything.

01:28:13.159 --> 01:28:16.113
Yes. But he's a bastard.

01:28:16.495 --> 01:28:18.203
Half of me is a bastard.

01:28:19.248 --> 01:28:21.240
My dark half.

01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:23.367
George Stark is my dark half.

01:28:23.585 --> 01:28:26.621
Yeah, but surely you don't
want him to stay alive.

01:28:26.796 --> 01:28:30.046
I mean, you can't still admire him
after all that he's done.

01:28:30.216 --> 01:28:33.965
- No.
- If you don't want him, he can't remain.

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:38.763
You're the one with life, real life.
He's trying to take it away from you.

01:28:38.974 --> 01:28:41.644
But if you're not willing to give it up...

01:28:41.852 --> 01:28:44.058
...what can he do?

01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:49.097
Kill you?
That would be suicide, wouldn't it?

01:28:51.611 --> 01:28:56.736
Why didn't I see that? He can't hurt me,
so he's going after the people around me.

01:28:57.158 --> 01:28:58.818
Exactly.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:03.573
I found something in Barringer's here.

01:29:03.789 --> 01:29:05.865
Something about sparrows.

01:29:06.458 --> 01:29:10.586
Whippoorwills, loons and sparrows...

01:29:11.588 --> 01:29:14.542
...are psychopomps.
- What?

01:29:14.883 --> 01:29:18.631
From the Greek.
It means "those who conduct".

01:29:19.846 --> 01:29:23.760
In this case,
those who conduct human souls...

01:29:23.974 --> 01:29:29.099
...back and forth between the land
of the living and the land of the dead.

01:29:29.855 --> 01:29:31.847
(phone rings)

01:29:36.778 --> 01:29:38.735
Hello?

01:29:39.405 --> 01:29:41.694
Thad! It's for you.

01:29:50.833 --> 01:29:54.912
I'm not gonna write your book, George.
You're dead. And dead you're gonna stay!

01:29:55.128 --> 01:29:57.915
(Stark) You're wrong, old Hoss.
You wanna get started.

01:29:58.131 --> 01:30:03.635
Start by nightfall or you'll be a sorry
son of a bitch. You won't be the only one.

01:30:03.803 --> 01:30:08.050
See if you can figure out where
I'm callin' from, Thad. (toy squeaks)

01:30:08.224 --> 01:30:10.133
(hangs up)

01:30:10.309 --> 01:30:12.551
No!

01:30:17.357 --> 01:30:20.109
- That was quick, Hoss.
- What have you done to them?

01:30:20.318 --> 01:30:22.275
Not a thing... yet. Not to your people.

01:30:22.487 --> 01:30:26.105
I had to do a few things to that
state trooper watchin' your house.

01:30:26.324 --> 01:30:29.490
What's left of him is out
in his bubble-mobile drawin' flies.

01:30:29.702 --> 01:30:32.656
- Let me talk to Liz.
- No time. Gotta go, buddy-roo.

01:30:32.871 --> 01:30:37.118
Me and the family, we gotta ride. I think
you know where we're all be headin'.

01:30:37.334 --> 01:30:39.326
Endsville, Thad.

01:30:39.503 --> 01:30:42.706
That place where
all rail service terminates.

01:30:42.881 --> 01:30:47.009
Oh. In case you're wonderin',
I cut the tracer on your phone here.

01:30:47.218 --> 01:30:50.836
I figure this is private business,
just between you and me.

01:30:51.055 --> 01:30:53.261
(hangs up)

01:30:58.937 --> 01:31:00.894
The trace...

01:31:02.065 --> 01:31:06.063
Jesus, the phone trace. They heard
my call, they wouldn't let her go.

01:31:06.277 --> 01:31:10.357
He's got Liz, Reggie. He's got my children.

01:31:10.615 --> 01:31:15.407
Be careful. Remember, he knows as
much about you as you know about him.

01:31:15.619 --> 01:31:18.289
Don't let him seduce you. Don't...

01:31:25.504 --> 01:31:28.588
They've come to take one of us away,
haven't they?

01:31:29.257 --> 01:31:31.582
- Which one?
- The loser, of course.

01:31:32.176 --> 01:31:34.798
I do hope it's not you, Thaddeus.

01:31:35.012 --> 01:31:39.555
I'd hate to think of George Stark
taking over your lecture group.

01:31:39.725 --> 01:31:43.094
- (Thad) Why isn't he aware of them?
- I don't know.

01:31:43.312 --> 01:31:46.727
- Let's take it as a good sign.
- I thought you knew about this shit.

01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:51.767
I don't know about any of it.
Nobody does, except the Almighty, and...

01:31:51.945 --> 01:31:54.233
...he seems to be on sabbatical.

01:31:56.115 --> 01:31:58.736
In the end, it's what you believe.

01:31:58.951 --> 01:32:01.822
I wish I had a talisman to give you,
or a silver bullet...

01:32:02.037 --> 01:32:04.445
...or a stake to drive
through the monster's heart.

01:32:04.665 --> 01:32:07.749
- But it's not that simple.
- You've given me all I need.

01:32:07.959 --> 01:32:10.166
Thanks, Reggie.

01:32:11.463 --> 01:32:16.171
Good luck. It'll be interesting to see
who's sitting in your office next week.

01:32:16.384 --> 01:32:20.216
- I'll be there.
- Wear a red carnation so I know it's you.

01:32:37.237 --> 01:32:41.448
I got a dead officer. I call that trouble.
We're pretty sure that Beaumont did it.

01:32:41.657 --> 01:32:44.065
- (Alan) Why's that?
- Well, he's outta here.

01:32:44.452 --> 01:32:47.239
He apparently took his family with him,
unless he cut them up.

01:32:47.454 --> 01:32:51.321
He killed that doctor in Bangor.
We got a positive ID from the receptionist.

01:32:51.541 --> 01:32:53.867
If he's heading to his place up there...

01:32:54.085 --> 01:32:58.083
...it would be real nice if you
were there to stop his fucking clock.

01:32:58.298 --> 01:33:00.504
You got it. Fine.

01:33:18.108 --> 01:33:20.599
Come on.

01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:24.361
Oh, shit.

01:33:24.572 --> 01:33:26.529
(sirens)

01:33:28.534 --> 01:33:30.823
Just keep on goin'.

01:33:30.995 --> 01:33:33.117
Keep on goin'.

01:34:02.482 --> 01:34:07.393
Me and Thad, we're gonna be doin' some
collaboratin', just like we always done.

01:34:07.612 --> 01:34:10.316
When it's over,
if you haven't pissed me off too bad...

01:34:10.531 --> 01:34:13.200
...I might just decide to let you go.

01:34:13.659 --> 01:34:17.953
But you understand,
it all depends on what kinda mood I'm in.

01:34:18.288 --> 01:34:21.704
If I'm in a good mood, a peaceful mood...

01:34:21.917 --> 01:34:24.289
...who knows what kinda turn
things might take?

01:34:24.461 --> 01:34:27.248
When all this is over I might
settle down up this way...

01:34:27.464 --> 01:34:30.879
...and I sure would want you
to think kindly of me.

01:34:31.509 --> 01:34:34.000
I like it here. I purely do.

01:34:35.805 --> 01:34:38.675
Yeah, I could get real comfortable here.

01:34:42.102 --> 01:34:44.593
(chuckles)

01:34:44.771 --> 01:34:47.309
Dream on, motherfucker.

01:34:53.654 --> 01:34:56.145
This is no dream, Beth.

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:03.785
Thad owes me.

01:35:03.997 --> 01:35:06.915
Maybe he knew how to write
before I showed up...

01:35:07.125 --> 01:35:09.912
...but I taught him to write
stuff people wanna read.

01:35:10.128 --> 01:35:14.375
Ain't no good writin' a thing
if people don't wanna read it.

01:35:14.591 --> 01:35:17.046
That's why I says Thad owes me.

01:35:17.552 --> 01:35:20.588
So you come after me,
you come after my children.

01:35:21.931 --> 01:35:24.386
You're a coward.

01:35:26.727 --> 01:35:30.012
You would do better
not to say things like that.

01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:38.684
Hell, I didn't want any of this trouble.

01:35:39.614 --> 01:35:43.148
Believe it or not,
I prefer to steer south of trouble.

01:35:43.367 --> 01:35:45.940
This writin' we gotta do,
I tried to do it by myself.

01:35:46.161 --> 01:35:48.450
It was comin' along good, too.

01:35:48.622 --> 01:35:50.911
Well, then I developed this, uh...

01:35:57.046 --> 01:35:59.253
...physical problem.

01:35:59.465 --> 01:36:01.588
I guess you noticed.

01:36:01.801 --> 01:36:04.422
Well, don't worry. I'll be better soon.

01:36:07.306 --> 01:36:09.298
Thad's gonna make me well.

01:36:09.475 --> 01:36:15.014
All's he got to do is write this one last
story and I'll be rockin' and rollin' again.

01:36:15.188 --> 01:36:18.272
Now, of course,
he might start feelin' poorly...

01:36:18.483 --> 01:36:21.400
...and workin' so... close together and all...

01:36:21.611 --> 01:36:25.062
...he might just go and catch
whatever this is that I got.

01:36:25.281 --> 01:36:29.824
That'd be a shame. I don't wish
the boy any harm, truly I don't.

01:36:30.035 --> 01:36:32.028
I hope it turns out different.

01:36:32.246 --> 01:36:36.991
But I got the feelin' that one or the other
of us is gonna have to fold his hand.

01:36:37.626 --> 01:36:41.409
And when it comes down to that
it's better him than me.

01:36:42.881 --> 01:36:44.873
My God.

01:36:47.009 --> 01:36:51.885
- Oh, my God, you really are...
- You're disturbin' my peaceful mood.

01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:57.759
You are disturbin'
the peaceful frame of mind I'm in.

01:36:58.937 --> 01:37:02.637
You are disturbin'
my peaceful frame of mind.

01:38:11.045 --> 01:38:14.545
(Elvis Presley)
I wonder if... you're lonesome tonight.

01:38:15.883 --> 01:38:20.260
You know, someone said that the world's
a stage, and each of us must play a part.

01:38:21.889 --> 01:38:25.507
- Fate had me playing in love...
- Liz.

01:38:27.269 --> 01:38:29.641
Oh, God, Liz. Are you all right?

01:38:29.855 --> 01:38:32.524
Huh? Are you OK?
The kids. Where are the kids?

01:38:32.732 --> 01:38:35.021
Right here, Hoss.

01:38:37.779 --> 01:38:39.771
(switches music off)

01:38:40.239 --> 01:38:43.442
Hello, Thad. How are you, old buddy?

01:38:44.243 --> 01:38:48.075
- You look a little peaky.
- You don't look so hot yourself.

01:38:50.916 --> 01:38:53.122
(Stark chuckles)

01:38:56.254 --> 01:39:00.168
Lf... I do what you want me to do...

01:39:01.801 --> 01:39:04.292
...you promise not to hurt them.

01:39:06.805 --> 01:39:09.047
If I do what you want...

01:39:10.142 --> 01:39:12.597
...will you leave them alone?

01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:15.053
I will. I promise.

01:39:15.272 --> 01:39:19.020
You have my word,
the word of a Southern man...

01:39:19.234 --> 01:39:21.522
...which is not given lightly.

01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:26.106
- Let me have them.
- You can have one.

01:39:55.058 --> 01:39:58.972
Liz, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for all this.

01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:05.606
- I'm gonna go upstairs with him.
- No. Thad, you can't.

01:40:05.902 --> 01:40:08.190
We don't have a choice.

01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:13.397
He can't hurt me. He won't. But he
can hurt you if you give him a reason.

01:40:13.617 --> 01:40:19.157
Don't be thinkin' about breakin' loose,
don't be thinkin' about the telephone...

01:40:20.457 --> 01:40:24.537
Guess we're on the same wavelength.
Ain't that right, Thad?

01:40:26.129 --> 01:40:29.083
Don't you see what's happening?
Just look at him.

01:40:29.298 --> 01:40:31.457
He doesn't want help writing a book.

01:40:31.676 --> 01:40:35.091
He wants to take over your life.
Can't you see that?

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:38.135
I know what he wants.

01:40:40.559 --> 01:40:44.639
What I don't know and what he doesn't
know is whether this'll really save him.

01:40:44.854 --> 01:40:48.804
I don't think it will save him.
I think he's finished.

01:40:49.108 --> 01:40:51.397
You know why?

01:40:52.028 --> 01:40:54.982
Cos I don't want him around any more.

01:40:55.156 --> 01:40:58.820
There's only one way to find out
who's finished and who's not.

01:40:59.034 --> 01:41:01.525
Ain't that right, Thad?

01:41:05.624 --> 01:41:07.616
Are you ready?

01:41:07.834 --> 01:41:10.123
Just waitin' on you.

01:41:37.028 --> 01:41:38.985
Yeah...

01:42:12.185 --> 01:42:14.391
(fluttering)

01:42:37.208 --> 01:42:40.293
(Thad) I'll start with Machine
stealing the police car.

01:42:40.461 --> 01:42:42.003
Yes, that's right.

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.327
(fluttering)

01:43:31.050 --> 01:43:33.920
- Give me a cigarette.
- I thought you quit.

01:43:34.136 --> 01:43:35.844
I did.

01:43:39.057 --> 01:43:41.631
Except for times like this.

01:43:48.733 --> 01:43:51.687
Times when me and you
are workin' together.

01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:35.647
(fluttering)

01:44:41.407 --> 01:44:41.940
Thad.

01:44:55.503 --> 01:44:57.626
Why don't you try, George?

01:44:57.839 --> 01:45:00.294
You gotta break in.

01:45:18.649 --> 01:45:20.642
I'm scared, Hoss.

01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:23.896
Oh, you know the only way to do it...

01:45:24.113 --> 01:45:26.355
...is to do it.

01:46:14.284 --> 01:46:16.241
(mutters)

01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:20.411
(fluttering)

01:46:21.624 --> 01:46:23.581
(Stark chuckles)

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:27.708
(frenzied twittering)

01:47:36.277 --> 01:47:38.768
(glass shatters)

01:47:40.739 --> 01:47:43.111
It's comin', Thad.

01:47:43.867 --> 01:47:47.200
It's comin' easy, it's comin' good.

01:47:48.163 --> 01:47:51.199
I can do it. I can do it.

01:47:54.752 --> 01:47:57.504
You shouldn't fuck with me, Hoss.

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:02.257
Don't you know I can tell
what you're thinkin'?

01:48:02.801 --> 01:48:06.466
Stop it, Thad.
Stop it, or I'm gonna have to cut ya.

01:48:07.514 --> 01:48:11.132
You're not gonna cut me, George.
You can't do shit to me and you know it.

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:14.056
I can do some shit
to the other folks around here.

01:48:14.479 --> 01:48:17.314
Yes, sir,
I can do some real ugly shit to them.

01:48:18.441 --> 01:48:20.398
Sit down, Thad.

01:48:20.610 --> 01:48:22.732
Make it easy on yourself.

01:48:23.487 --> 01:48:26.571
Sit down and... shut your eyes.

01:48:27.282 --> 01:48:29.738
See if you can't just...

01:48:31.661 --> 01:48:33.903
...drift on off.

01:48:34.122 --> 01:48:35.949
You go to hell.

01:50:18.469 --> 01:50:20.710
(fluttering)

01:50:28.645 --> 01:50:31.218
They've come to take you away, George.

01:50:31.439 --> 01:50:33.930
Take you back to the devil.

01:50:35.776 --> 01:50:37.733
(child gurgles)

01:50:54.585 --> 01:50:56.578
(Liz) Thad?

01:50:57.213 --> 01:50:59.205
Thad!

01:50:59.381 --> 01:51:02.631
OK. You sit here.
I gotta open the door now.

01:51:19.775 --> 01:51:22.396
I didn't want it to be like this, Hoss.

01:51:24.905 --> 01:51:27.443
I had a different sort of thing in mind.

01:51:28.742 --> 01:51:30.319
Yes, I did.

01:51:38.751 --> 01:51:41.787
They've come to write the ending, George.

01:51:43.339 --> 01:51:47.039
Is it gonna be your ending... or mine?

01:51:47.259 --> 01:51:49.252
(thudding)

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:57.299
Kinda clumsy there, George.

01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:19.785
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give you...
one last chance here, Thad.

01:52:21.165 --> 01:52:23.372
Stop whatever it is that you're doin' here.

01:52:23.584 --> 01:52:25.992
I'm not doin' anything, Hoss.

01:52:26.712 --> 01:52:30.377
I'm just waitin' around
to see how things turn out.

01:52:38.181 --> 01:52:40.886
Stop it, Thad. Stop it.

01:52:41.101 --> 01:52:44.220
I'm sorry, George. I can't.

01:52:47.023 --> 01:52:49.311
Neither can you.

01:52:51.610 --> 01:52:54.066
The ending, huh?

01:52:56.156 --> 01:52:59.607
Well, let's see how you like this ending,
Hoss.

01:53:07.375 --> 01:53:09.581
No!

01:53:09.794 --> 01:53:12.082
(gun fires)

01:53:12.296 --> 01:53:14.335
(creaking)

01:53:30.021 --> 01:53:32.060
(screams)

01:53:52.041 --> 01:53:53.286
Alan!

01:53:58.339 --> 01:54:00.830
Hurry up!

01:54:01.050 --> 01:54:04.501
- What the hell's goin' on? What is this?
- They're upstairs.

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:06.344
- Who?
- He took them upstairs.

01:54:06.513 --> 01:54:09.051
- Where's Thad?
- He's upstairs. He's with Stark.

01:54:09.265 --> 01:54:11.721
- Hold still!
- He's got the kids upstairs.

01:54:11.935 --> 01:54:13.678
Liz, no! No!

01:54:41.712 --> 01:54:43.954
Wait! Wait here!

01:54:56.601 --> 01:54:58.843
(Stark screaming)

01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:37.212
Liz.
