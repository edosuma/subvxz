WEBVTT

00:03.640 --> 00:05.600
Here are the files you asked
for, Lord Montague.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.840
Thank you.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.520
No more calls, Miss Maitland.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.680
I'm leaving in exactly two minutes.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.000
Only contactable in case
of emergency, on pain of death.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.560
Oh, and...

00:21.560 --> 00:23.200
..Happy New Year.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.000
PHONE RINGS

00:29.040 --> 00:31.320
I just...

00:29.040 --> 00:31.320
BIG BEN TOLLS

00:31.320 --> 00:33.320
Special Branch? Yes, go on.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.160
This better be good, Jones.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.800
If I don't get ahead of
that snowstorm...

00:44.320 --> 00:46.040
Contact Kembleford Police.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.120
Get every available officer
to my estate immediately.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.040
Sir Charles, Lady Hakeworth!
Hello.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.560
Thrilled you could make it.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.400
Our pleasure, Lady Felicia.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.400
LOUD BIRD CALL

01:31.400 --> 01:33.120
My personal physician, Dr Muthomi.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.640
Welcome to Montague, Doctor.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.760
Delighted to be here.

01:35.760 --> 01:36.880
Where's Monty?

01:36.880 --> 01:39.040
I have an admirably geriatric bottle

01:39.040 --> 01:40.600
of Talisker I'd like
his opinion on.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.760
Due any moment. Hornby...My Lady.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.640
Show our guests of honour
to their rooms

01:44.640 --> 01:47.520
and bring up a decanter
for the whisky.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.480
Thank you again for
your help, Sidney.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.240
It's not every day you get to drive
the Minister of Defence.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.840
That's the lot. What's next?

01:57.840 --> 01:59.800
Hornby has a tuxedo for you.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.560
For me?

02:01.560 --> 02:03.440
You want me at the ball?

02:03.440 --> 02:06.080
I invited you as a guest,
not an employee.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.520
On two conditions.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.880
Don't get too drunk,

02:08.880 --> 02:11.520
and you must ask at least
one lady to dance.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.360
CAR APPROACHES

02:11.520 --> 02:13.360
Dance?

02:13.360 --> 02:15.760
Male partners are a trifle
thin on the ground this year.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.000
CAR HORN

02:17.000 --> 02:18.480
Monty!

02:33.600 --> 02:36.040
See? Nothing to worry about.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.440
Oh, it's just you.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.680
Oh, that's charming.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.600
Sorry. Monty's gone AWOL.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.600
LOUD BIRD CALL

02:42.600 --> 02:43.920
We come bearing gifts.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.200
Thank you.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.560
Let me guess. Scones?

02:46.560 --> 02:48.400
Award-winning strawberry scones.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.240
Scones would be totally unsuitable
for an occasion like this.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.600
Petit fours. French.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.880
Just imagine.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.960
My baking being sampled
by a future Prime Minister.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.760
Oh. Lord Finchmore.

03:02.760 --> 03:04.240
Robert, please.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.440
I hear "Lord Finchmore" and
I think my father's ghost

03:06.440 --> 03:07.920
is stood behind me.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.240
Still writing poetry?

03:09.240 --> 03:10.600
For my sins.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.520
Where's my rogue of an uncle?

03:12.520 --> 03:13.640
On his way.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.200
If he knows what's good for him.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.240
Is that Ruth Moulton??

03:17.240 --> 03:18.680
Bunty.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.640
I recognised your car.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.920
Ruth! Last I heard,
you were off to Oxford.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.160
Ah, yes, St Hilda's and I had
a little falling out.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.360
I got sent down.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.640
Oh, dear. Well, you'll have
to tell me all about it.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.480
But for now let's all get in
from the cold.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.040
Yes.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.040
CAR HORN

03:33.040 --> 03:35.440
This is a private event!

03:35.440 --> 03:37.680
I've orders to seal off the estate.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.320
Nobody's allowed in or out, m'lady.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.360
Under whose authority?

03:42.360 --> 03:44.040
Your husband's.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.760
LOUD BIRD CALL

03:49.480 --> 03:52.080
Oh. Have you found out
what's going on?

03:52.080 --> 03:53.480
Not yet.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.040
The Inspector told me
to "be elsewhere."

03:56.040 --> 03:58.680
No, something's up, though.
They're searching the grounds.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.800
Probably some miscreant at large.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.720
Sidney, do you not have duties
to attend to?

04:03.720 --> 04:05.880
Sid has been invited to the ball.

04:05.880 --> 04:08.440
Oh, wonderful.
You must be thrilled, Sid.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.000
Not really.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.440
Oh, come on, Mrs M,
why won't you join us?

04:13.440 --> 04:15.080
Well, it's all very well for you,

04:15.080 --> 04:17.680
with your wardrobes full
of fancy frocks.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.000
I'm hardly going to fit in
in this now, am I?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.040
Is that all?

04:21.040 --> 04:22.560
We have bundles of ballgowns.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.520
I can help pick something out
for you.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.040
Oh, say you'll come.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.800
Oh, all right. Well, just for you.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.840
Come on. Ah...

04:38.200 --> 04:41.800
MUSIC: 'Trout' Quintet, D.667
by Franz Schubert

04:45.920 --> 04:48.040
Sure nothing's wrong?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.560
They're probably here to arrest you,
Lord Finchmore,

04:50.560 --> 04:52.840
for crimes against literature.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.240
I'd rather be a bad poet
than a bad politician,

04:55.240 --> 04:56.440
Sir Charles.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.240
At least my words don't kill people.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.720
Not for lack of trying.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.840
Ah, pretty as a picture.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.480
Pictures are intended to be
gawped at, Sir Charles.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.680
I prefer an intelligent
conversation.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.760
LAUGHTER

05:08.760 --> 05:10.880
Hello, everyone. Monty! Finally.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.400
Lady Felicia was considering sending
out a search party.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.920
My humblest apologies.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.240
Where have you been?

05:16.240 --> 05:19.000
I'll explain. First, Sir Charles,
a word in private?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.320
Perhaps you'd join us, Father?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.160
And me? Am I allowed to know what's
about to happen in my own home?

05:23.160 --> 05:24.560
A rather delicate matter.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.040
Yes. Why not?

05:35.880 --> 05:37.960
I'm obliged to you, Sir.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.440
Special Branch believes
the death threat is credible.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.360
And I told them it's
an occupational hazard.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.080
Ask Julius Caesar.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.120
What did the death threat say?

05:49.120 --> 05:50.360
HE CLEARS THROAT

05:51.920 --> 05:54.960
"Hakeworth must answer
for his crimes.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.000
"The Red Death is coming."

05:57.000 --> 05:58.520
Red Death?

05:58.520 --> 06:00.800
Communists. Should've known.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.320
Maybe you should return to London?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.920
You'd never get through the snow.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.040
Montague's safe, easily protected.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.680
I'll protect you until
Special Branch arrives.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.760
I'll stick to you like glue.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.480
LADY FELICIA: But we've been
planning this ball for months.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.440
Fear not, Cinderella.
It shall go ahead.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.680
I insist.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.520
Sir Charles?

06:24.520 --> 06:27.000
I know Lord Montague thinks
highly of you, Father,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.880
but I don't need a priest just yet.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.200
It's a hoax.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.640
Eden's on his last legs.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.400
I'll soon have the support
to succeed Churchill.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.800
Someone wants to put
the wind up me.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.600
But you don't know who?

06:39.600 --> 06:43.040
I doubt my enemies would give
notice before sticking

06:43.040 --> 06:44.480
a knife in my back.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.040
Except...

06:47.200 --> 06:49.000
Just his puerile humour.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.080
Finchmore!

06:51.080 --> 06:52.760
Well?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.360
Is he in danger?

06:55.720 --> 06:59.280
Edgar Allen Poe's chilling allegory
The Red Death

06:59.280 --> 07:04.680
argues that "Darkness and Decay hold
illimitable dominion over all".

07:04.680 --> 07:07.440
Even the rich and powerful
will face judgment.

07:07.440 --> 07:11.600
Luckily, whoever wishes to dispense
said judgment will do well

07:11.600 --> 07:13.800
to get through a police cordon.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.640
Unless the fox is already
amongst the chickens.

07:19.280 --> 07:22.320
Ha! You've lost your marbles.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.240
This prank proves that you're
as feeble-minded as your father.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.800
Mention him again.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.040
I dare you.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.120
Good to see you again,
Miss Moulton.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.920
Dr Muthomi.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.320
Haven't you got the message?

07:38.320 --> 07:39.800
Keep away from us.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.360
Who knew Sir Charles would be
at Montague tonight?

07:54.360 --> 07:55.800
I mentioned it to Ruth.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.360
She lives in Sir Charles'
constituency.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.520
How do you know her?

07:59.520 --> 08:02.040
Daughter of a friend of a friend.
We used to invite her round

08:02.040 --> 08:04.960
to keep Bunty company.
It became a tradition.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.360
I warned Robert that
Sir Charles was attending.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.520
"Warned"?

08:08.520 --> 08:10.280
He's always despised Sir Charles.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.360
Robert's a tormented soul.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.960
His father, Monty's brother-in-law,
killed himself a few years ago.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.520
Lady Hakeworth knew they were
coming, of course. And Dr Muthomi.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.640
Fascinating chap.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.720
Lady Hakeworth found him in
an orphanage in Nairobi.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.200
Brilliant mind. They took him in,
paid for his education.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.440
They adopted him?

08:28.440 --> 08:31.280
Not officially. Sir Robert didn't
think having a Kenyan for

08:31.280 --> 08:33.640
a son would help
his political career. Mm.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.000
Oh. I nearly forgot.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.040
This was put on my desk by mistake.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.320
Ah.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.200
It's, erm...

08:45.200 --> 08:48.640
..from an old friend in, ah,
New York.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.440
Whenever she visits a restaurant,

08:50.440 --> 08:52.600
she insists on sending me a review.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.360
I should go and check on
the catering.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.120
I believe I'm in the doghouse.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.280
My dearest Felicia.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.320
I feel your absence more keenly

09:13.320 --> 09:15.640
with every day that passes.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.240
Yet your last letter gave me hope.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.440
In return, I wish to give you
something.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.120
A choice.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.440
KNOCK AT DOOR

09:39.440 --> 09:42.040
You know Sir Charles is
only courting you?

09:43.320 --> 09:46.280
He wants your backing
to become Prime Minister.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.480
Please tell me you're not working.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.840
Sorry, sorry.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.920
Last minute problems
with the Gunner Day report.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.240
I hoped, for once, you'd prioritise
your friends and family.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.000
Me, even.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.840
But to be late to your own party!

09:59.840 --> 10:01.080
I'm here now.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.520
Are you?

10:02.520 --> 10:05.160
Even when we're together,
your mind is elsewhere.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.760
I wonder if I packed a bag and left
how long it would take you

10:07.760 --> 10:09.880
to even notice that I'd gone?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.400
Sorry, I...

10:12.400 --> 10:14.920
No, no, you're right.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.120
We'll talk.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.080
Tonight, however, we must keep up
appearances for our guests.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.240
Very well.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.400
I'm ready if you are.

10:56.080 --> 11:00.360
Do you think Sir Charles has tried
one of my petit fours yet?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.000
Surely only a matter of time.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.360
Mm.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.920
THEY LAUGH

11:10.920 --> 11:12.320
Robert, Ruth.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.120
Please may I introduce you
to Sidney Carter?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.960
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.000
I recognise you.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.440
You used to be the chauffeur!

11:21.440 --> 11:22.840
Oh, poor Aunt Felicia.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.520
So many guests dropping out with
the weather she's been forced

11:25.520 --> 11:27.320
to make up the numbers.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.120
Excuse me.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.640
What did I say?

11:34.280 --> 11:37.480
APPLAUSE

11:37.480 --> 11:42.120
Ladies, gentlemen, welcome to
our annual masked ball.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.400
Thank you for coming.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.880
Now, the more observant amongst you
will have noticed

11:45.880 --> 11:48.160
the constabulary outside.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.160
I told the Inspector
he wasn't invited,

11:51.160 --> 11:53.400
but he wouldn't take
no for an answer, so...

11:53.400 --> 11:54.600
LAUGHTER

11:54.600 --> 11:55.720
Nothing to be alarmed by!

11:55.720 --> 11:58.080
Just an added precaution,
that's all.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.640
There is plenty of food and drink,

12:00.640 --> 12:05.840
so indulge yourselves and
have a wonderful time.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.040
Music!

12:07.040 --> 12:09.440
APPLAUSE, MUSICIANS PLAY

12:20.320 --> 12:23.200
Ah, a petit four, Sir Charles?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.800
Ah, Lady Hakeworth?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.040
Yes, all right.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.200
Sir Charles?

12:31.760 --> 12:34.040
No... Oh, darling!

12:35.640 --> 12:37.720
Are you all right, Sir Charles?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.520
Ah...

12:39.520 --> 12:41.480
Migraine.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.280
I might have a lie down.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.120
I'll come with you.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.800
The devil you will!

12:49.680 --> 12:51.000
Oh.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.240
Don't eat that.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.840
It's been on the floor.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.200
Excuse me.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.080
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

13:19.320 --> 13:20.760
Arrrgh!

13:20.760 --> 13:23.560
CHEERFUL MUSIC

13:28.880 --> 13:30.920
Not dancing, Dr Muthomi?

13:30.920 --> 13:33.440
I have no desire to create
a spectacle.

13:33.440 --> 13:37.160
Oh, I'm sure Lord and Lady Montague
would wish all their guests

13:37.160 --> 13:39.640
to enjoy themselves.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.000
Perhaps Miss Moulton would like
a dance?

13:42.000 --> 13:45.440
That would not be appropriate,
professionally speaking.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.200
Oh. Is she a patient of yours?

13:48.200 --> 13:49.640
No. She...

13:49.640 --> 13:52.080
She knows Sir Charles, that's all.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.280
Ah.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.040
I hope you manage to have
some fun.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.560
Done a sweep. Nothing to report.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.680
But we've checked your list
of those aware

14:02.680 --> 14:04.040
of Sir Charles' attendance.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.640
It turns out Lord Finchmore has
a record.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.600
Drunk-and-disorderly,
assault.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.280
Fisticuffs over cards,
I believe. Ancient history.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.200
Then there's Miss Moulton.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.200
Don't mind me.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.000
Sent down from Oxford University
for ill-advised acts of protest

14:21.000 --> 14:22.720
in support of the Mau Mau.

14:22.720 --> 14:23.880
Ah.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.480
Sir Charles is sending
further troops to Kenya.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.040
Perhaps Miss Moulton wishes
to scare him into

14:29.040 --> 14:30.800
changing his mind.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.880
Erm...

14:31.880 --> 14:33.280
Excuse me, gentlemen.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.840
I should check on our guests.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.880
Just had word from
Special Branch, Sir.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.120
Storm's getting worse.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.240
Their officers are stuck outside
Kiddington.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.800
Then it's lucky for them I have
everything under control.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.960
I went to check on Charles.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.120
The door's locked.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.160
He's not answering.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.200
KEY TURNS IN LOCK

14:58.320 --> 15:00.560
I'll be hauled over the coals
for this.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.000
The Inspector says you shouldn't...
He's my husband!

15:03.000 --> 15:05.040
SHE GASPS

15:05.040 --> 15:06.600
Sorry, sir.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.840
I've given Lady Hakeworth
a sedative.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.960
She's sleeping.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.160
Cause of death?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.760
Sir Charles was strangled.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.120
Or garrotted, to be precise.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.920
Well, there wasn't much sign
of a struggle.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.800
A strong man could've rendered him
unconscious in seconds.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.280
Of course, it was only
a superficial assessment.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.480
If you require a more thorough
examination...

15:34.480 --> 15:36.520
Do it. I need answers.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.560
I should make an announcement.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.480
Ah.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.920
If people learn there's been
a murder they may panic

15:46.920 --> 15:48.760
and try to leave.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.040
Hate to say it,
but the padre's right.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.520
That cordon breaks,
the killer vanishes.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.880
Best keep silent.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.440
What about interviewing witnesses?

15:56.440 --> 15:57.720
Well, there's no rush.

15:57.720 --> 16:01.360
We'll check for fingerprints,
secure the crime scene,

16:01.360 --> 16:03.000
wait for Special Branch.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.200
Do something for me, Father?

16:09.200 --> 16:11.120
Find the devil who did this.

16:23.360 --> 16:26.960
Any indication of what was used
to strangle the victim?

16:26.960 --> 16:28.640
Hard to say.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.960
A cord, a rope?

16:30.960 --> 16:32.360
A dog collar.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.120
Oh, wait, it's none of
your business!

16:35.120 --> 16:36.880
No sign of a weapon, sir.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.000
But this was in a bin
down the corridor.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.040
The murderer must've locked
the door behind them

16:41.040 --> 16:42.240
then disposed of the key.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.680
Probably to delay
the body being found.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.480
Looks like there's
a fingerprint, though.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.280
Only a partial one, mind,
but I'll get it looked at.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.880
Good work, Sergeant.

16:50.880 --> 16:55.040
Talking of fingerprints,
have you seen Sir Charles' fingers?

16:55.040 --> 16:58.560
Abrasions, from where he tried
to remove the ligature, perhaps?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.360
Quite possibly.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.680
Downstairs he was unwell.

17:04.360 --> 17:09.080
Between us, he'd been drinking
since we first arrived.

17:09.080 --> 17:10.680
Whisky.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.040
Brought his own.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.440
So where is it?

17:16.440 --> 17:19.760
I require acetone for cleaning
my medical equipment,

17:19.760 --> 17:21.880
so I don't contaminate the body.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.560
With your permission,
I know who may have some.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.040
Be discreet.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.560
And you, Padre.

17:37.320 --> 17:41.720
"Abrasions from where he tried
to remove the ligature"?

17:41.720 --> 17:44.960
I've been reading Kerr's Guide
to Forensic Medicine, sir.

17:44.960 --> 17:47.600
You see, I was thinking of
taking my inspector's exams.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.920
INSPECTOR MALLORY LAUGHS

17:49.920 --> 17:51.840
Sorry, I thought you were j...

17:51.840 --> 17:54.320
Your inspector's exams?

17:54.320 --> 17:56.840
I'd hoped for your blessing,
sir, but...

17:57.760 --> 17:58.960
Stupid of me.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.600
Just forget I said anything, sir.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.200
Right.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.560
Well, I need you to start taking
the fingerprints from the guests.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.360
Say it's an additional
security measure.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.080
Yes, sir.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.200
What on earth is the matter?

18:30.800 --> 18:32.520
I'm leaving Monty.

18:32.520 --> 18:36.240
No, no. You can't mean that.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.440
What has bought all this on?

18:38.440 --> 18:40.320
Someone.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.080
An, ah...

18:42.080 --> 18:43.640
An acquaintance...

18:43.640 --> 18:45.800
A man.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.800
..has asked me to elope.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.720
So not exactly an acquaintance,
then?

18:50.720 --> 18:53.680
I said no, but in truth I'm...

18:53.680 --> 18:56.240
Tempted by his Gallic charms?

18:56.240 --> 18:57.600
You knew?

18:57.600 --> 18:59.680
I had my suspicions.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.840
Then I saw his handwriting
on the envelope.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.160
Wait a minute. You...

19:05.160 --> 19:07.160
You can't mean Flambeau?

19:07.160 --> 19:08.520
I know!

19:08.520 --> 19:11.520
But I can't deny there's
something between us.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.520
He's so exciting,
and handsome and...

19:15.520 --> 19:18.280
And an immoral, deceitful thief.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.400
Well, at least Hercule treasures me.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.760
Monty may have loved me once,

19:21.760 --> 19:25.840
but now he's as passionate
and demonstrative as a biscuit!

19:25.840 --> 19:28.760
Anyway I thought Flambeau
had gone to America?

19:28.760 --> 19:30.400
He's been writing to me.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.920
And now he's sent an aeroplane
ticket so that I can join him.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.600
Have you told Lord Montague
you're unhappy?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.160
I shouldn't have to!

19:40.160 --> 19:44.120
Sometimes we don't notice that
which we see every day.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.800
Excuse me for changing the subject,

19:48.800 --> 19:53.000
but I wondered if you'd join Bunty
and I in the kitchen downstairs.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.680
I need your assistance.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.200
I would ask Sid as well,
but he seems to have vanished.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.600
Well, that can wait.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.000
Whatever it is, it is far more
important that you talk

20:02.000 --> 20:03.840
some sense into her head

20:03.840 --> 20:05.440
Sir Charles Hakeworth is dead.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.000
What?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.800
How?

20:08.800 --> 20:12.320
Well, I was rather hoping you'd help
me to find out.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.200
Why can't you just leave it
to the police?

20:18.200 --> 20:21.120
It will take hours to compare
all the fingerprints of

20:21.120 --> 20:24.400
the guests, and the murderer
might escape.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.960
And we've no idea what was used
to strangle Sir Charles?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.600
Except that it scratched
his fingertips as he fought

20:29.600 --> 20:30.920
to remove it.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.840
So we know the how
and the where,

20:33.840 --> 20:36.640
but not the who, the why
or the with what?

20:36.640 --> 20:37.960
Indeed.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.000
Only Lord Finchmore,
Miss Moulton, Lady Hakeworth

20:41.000 --> 20:44.240
and Dr Muthomi knew that
Sir Charles would be here.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.000
Bunty, you know Miss Moulton?

20:47.000 --> 20:48.360
A little.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.920
I saw her talking
to Lord Finchmore earlier.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.160
Check whether they can give
each other an alibi for

20:53.160 --> 20:54.760
the time of Sir Charles' death.

20:54.760 --> 20:55.800
Will do.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.760
I will talk to the staff to see
if Dr Muthomi left

20:59.760 --> 21:02.000
after Sir Charles from the ballroom.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.560
The doctor's hardly going to kill
his own patient, is he?

21:05.560 --> 21:07.680
Not just a patient.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.000
His father-figure who refused
to acknowledge him

21:11.000 --> 21:12.360
as his legal child.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.680
What about Lady Hakeworth?

21:13.680 --> 21:16.400
She had an opportunity when
she went to check on Sir Charles.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.240
Opportunity, yes.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.120
Motive, no.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.480
I don't mind mingling
with the guests,

21:22.480 --> 21:25.160
pick up any gossip. Mm-hm!

21:25.160 --> 21:27.920
In order to bring a murderer
to justice!

21:27.920 --> 21:29.760
Thank you, Mrs McCarthy.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.240
What shall I do?

21:31.240 --> 21:32.800
Look for Sid?

21:32.800 --> 21:36.000
Perhaps you should look to
your husband first.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Once more unto the breach?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.040
Father?

21:45.040 --> 21:48.040
There is someone else
I need to ask for help.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.600
Oh.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.400
MAN GRUNTS

22:01.960 --> 22:04.400
MAN HICCUPS

22:09.400 --> 22:10.880
Sid?

22:17.320 --> 22:19.600
I feel sick.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.040
One over the eight?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.440
Just the one, full stop.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.800
Single malt.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.640
And something else.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.200
Where did you find this?

22:38.520 --> 22:41.160
It's important.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.720
Oh... Well, I decided the ball
wasn't for me so I went upstairs.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.400
I saw someone stashing that in
a cupboard and I thought,

22:54.400 --> 22:58.040
"Must be decent if they're going
to the trouble of hiding it."

22:59.480 --> 23:01.480
Did you see their face?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.840
Nah.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.240
They were wearing a mask.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.640
Red skull.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.560
The Red Death.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.680
THEY GIGGLE

23:20.680 --> 23:22.000
Bunty!

23:22.000 --> 23:23.960
Seeking respite from
the madding crowd?

23:23.960 --> 23:26.280
I was just hoping to have
a moment with Ruth.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.520
I'll get some more Champagne. Hm.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.040
Only a bit of fun.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.200
No other men at this party
worth talking to.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.200
Oh, well, don't let me stop you.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.040
I just wanted to tell you something.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.400
Please be discreet about it.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.200
Sir Charles is dead.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.560
Dead? How?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.880
Strangled.

23:48.880 --> 23:52.520
Well, Robert and I have been
together the whole time.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.960
Are you certain of that?

23:54.960 --> 23:56.720
Yes.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.640
And a good thing for Robert.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.560
He's never hidden the fact
that he loathes Sir Charles.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.440
Do you know why?

24:05.360 --> 24:07.320
It may help find the killer.

24:08.960 --> 24:13.480
All I know is he blames Sir Charles
for his father's death.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.240
Sounds like a motive to me.

24:15.240 --> 24:18.440
But if Robert's innocent,
he has nothing to fear.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.440
They found a fingerprint.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.680
Miss Moulton, you're here.

24:22.680 --> 24:25.280
Did you bring acetone
for removing nail varnish?

24:25.280 --> 24:28.440
I need some for my work.
If it's no bother.

24:28.440 --> 24:31.000
Ah, yes. I'll fetch some now.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
And as you say,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
Robert has nothing to fear.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.240
About what?

24:39.200 --> 24:41.120
Sir Charles has been murdered.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.600
I... I wanted to apologise.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.720
I've been vile to you all evening.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.880
No, no, no. No, you've been under
a lot of pressure,

24:56.880 --> 24:58.320
getting everything ready and...

24:58.320 --> 24:59.800
Well, it's more than that.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.760
You must know I...

25:04.840 --> 25:07.760
I haven't been happy for a...

25:07.760 --> 25:09.080
For a very long time.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.240
Must I? Perhaps, yes.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.600
So...

25:17.840 --> 25:19.320
What are you saying?

25:19.320 --> 25:20.800
Well, how do you feel?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.720
About me.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.480
Feel about you?

25:26.480 --> 25:28.440
You're my wife!

25:28.440 --> 25:30.960
And?

25:30.960 --> 25:35.160
Let's not get into this right now,
hm? We'll talk later, I promise.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.920
So you think Sir Charles
was drugged?

25:38.920 --> 25:42.200
Whatever was in that decanter
knocked Sid for six.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.880
I had to make him a very strong
cup of coffee.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.760
The use of medication rather
points at Dr Muthomi.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.080
Nobody saw the doctor
leave the ballroom

25:50.080 --> 25:52.920
but that doesn't prove
he didn't slip out unnoticed.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.680
Did you speak to Miss Moulton?

25:54.680 --> 25:59.080
Yes. Apparently Robert blames
Sir Charles for his father's death.

25:59.080 --> 26:02.040
But Ruth insists they were together
the whole time.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.200
Well, that is very odd,

26:04.200 --> 26:07.480
because one of the guests told me
that Lord Finchmore

26:07.480 --> 26:10.640
and Lady Hakeworth were seen
arguing on the landing.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.960
LADY HAKEWORTH: How dare you?!

26:11.960 --> 26:15.080
You're a disgrace to your family
name, spreading these lies.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.720
Your precious husband's not
the saint you think he is.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.000
Should I tell you how my father
found out?

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Perhaps what Lady Hakeworth found
out about her husband

26:23.000 --> 26:24.320
drove her to murder?

26:24.320 --> 26:26.600
So where was Ruth during all this?

26:26.600 --> 26:27.840
Oh. heaven only knows.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.920
That young woman spells trouble.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.800
And Lady Hakeworth has been saying
as much to anyone who'll listen.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.960
What did Ruth do to her?

26:35.960 --> 26:40.160
Well, apparently Miss Moulton
turned up at their house, uninvited,

26:40.160 --> 26:43.280
making a fuss over some
petition about Kenya.

26:43.280 --> 26:46.000
Oh, Sir Charles quite rightly sent
her packing.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.200
WOMAN SCREAMS

26:58.000 --> 26:59.840
WOMAN: Murder!

27:01.440 --> 27:03.440
SHE SCREAMS

27:05.640 --> 27:06.960
Oh!

27:06.960 --> 27:08.280
What happened?

27:08.280 --> 27:13.120
I... I came to fetch some
acetone for Dr Muthomi.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.560
And that thing was in here.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.920
He had a knife.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.720
Fetch the doctor.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.040
Quickly.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
SHE WHIMPERS

27:24.360 --> 27:26.280
I'm scared, Father.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.360
God is with you. And so am I.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.600
The doctor says she's in
grave danger.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.720
Just pray that help arrives soon.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.440
You saw the culprit?

27:43.440 --> 27:46.360
He was wearing the Red Death mask.

27:46.360 --> 27:51.000
If Miss Moulton was getting acetone
for Dr Muthomi, where was he?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.680
He was with me.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.800
Lady Hakeworth!
We didn't realise you were awake.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.160
I heard the commotion.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.120
Dr Muthomi was in your room?

27:58.120 --> 28:01.440
I cried out in my sleep.
He came to my aid.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
Have you caught my husband's
murderer yet?

28:03.440 --> 28:06.720
Our investigations are ongoing,
your ladyship.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.040
Lady Hakeworth,

28:09.040 --> 28:13.040
what did Lord Finchmore accuse
your husband of doing?

28:13.040 --> 28:14.880
You were seen arguing with him.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.880
He made the baseless claim that
Charles had a liaison

28:19.880 --> 28:23.520
with Lord Finchmore's mother,
prompting his father's suicide.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.280
Whoever killed Sir Charles,

28:25.280 --> 28:27.840
why would they want to attack
that young lady?

28:27.840 --> 28:30.800
There must be a connection.
Lady Hakeworth,

28:30.800 --> 28:33.440
is it true that Miss Moulton
visited your home?

28:33.440 --> 28:36.920
Oh, yes. Brandishing her petition.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.520
Which Sir Charles rejected?

28:38.520 --> 28:42.200
Naturally. When that failed,
she tried her feminine wiles.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.400
Which were also rejected,
might I add.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.320
Miss Moulton made advances on?

28:46.320 --> 28:48.440
The moment she got Charles alone.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.640
If you don't believe me,
ask Dr Muthomi.

28:52.640 --> 28:56.280
He saw her scurrying off
with her tail between her legs.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.720
Oh, Sidney,
how are you feeling now?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.920
Like a hedgehog's nesting
in my skull.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.640
And then there were three.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.960
Lady Hakeworth, Dr Muthomi,
or Lord Finchmore?

29:09.960 --> 29:12.240
Well, it has to be Lord Finchmore.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.120
He's keen on Miss Moulton,

29:14.120 --> 29:16.680
finds out she threw herself
at Sir Charles,

29:16.680 --> 29:19.200
and attacks them both in
a jealous rage.

29:19.200 --> 29:22.120
But until today,
Robert hadn't seen Ruth in years.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.280
And the death threat was sent
hours earlier.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.960
What if we accept Lord Finchmore's
claim that Sir Charles

29:26.960 --> 29:31.240
was an adulterer?
A young, attractive woman turns up

29:31.240 --> 29:34.520
at his house uninvited
and leaves in tears.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.760
What are you saying, Father?

29:36.760 --> 29:39.320
That it wasn't her that
threw herself at him?

29:39.320 --> 29:42.240
You think he assaulted her?

29:42.240 --> 29:46.880
No, but Miss Moulton can't be the
Red Death because you saw

29:46.880 --> 29:49.800
the killer running from her room
while she was still inside.

29:49.800 --> 29:54.640
But what if someone else got
revenge on her behalf?

29:54.640 --> 29:57.840
The only witness
to Sir Charles' crime.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.040
The doctor, you mean?

30:00.040 --> 30:03.160
If that were true, why then
stab Ruth?

30:05.880 --> 30:07.080
Um...

30:11.600 --> 30:14.040
I feel like I let Lady F down.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.920
It was hardly your fault.

30:15.920 --> 30:19.160
But I shouldn't be pilfering other
people's whisky, should I?

30:19.160 --> 30:23.040
If that's how you feel,
it's not too late to make amends.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.240
How did it go with...?

30:24.240 --> 30:27.120
Monty couldn't offer me one word
of affection.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.600
I rather think we've reached
the end of the road.

30:33.520 --> 30:35.840
With permission,
I'd like to accompany her to

30:35.840 --> 30:38.320
the hospital.
She's lost a lot of blood.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.680
I'd like that.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.920
Perhaps I could escort them, sir?
Very well. Go with her.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.840
Before you leave, Doctor Muthomi,

30:45.840 --> 30:48.680
might I trouble you
for a painkiller? Headache.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.800
No time, Father.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.720
Surely you must have some
in your bag? We must go.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.440
Open your bag, I insist!

30:57.440 --> 31:00.280
Thought you'd sneak past the cordon
in the ambulance, did you?

31:00.280 --> 31:01.800
He deserved it!

31:06.760 --> 31:08.280
After him!

31:08.280 --> 31:10.360
Get her to the hospital.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.640
Don't worry. He won't get away.

31:29.360 --> 31:33.080
VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS

31:33.080 --> 31:34.960
Just remember what I taught you.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.040
I'll do my best.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.680
So, who's it going to be?

31:38.680 --> 31:41.680
Ah, Mathilda Pitcher,
she's a sweetheart.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.360
Lily Mansfield?

31:45.360 --> 31:46.960
Lily's a bit of a handful.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.040
Nah.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.080
I know just the girl for me.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.680
Who?

31:56.680 --> 31:59.920
Mrs M, will you do me the honour?

31:59.920 --> 32:03.160
Oh, Sidney!
Well, that would be lovely.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.880
Sidney, you're quite the dancer!

32:12.880 --> 32:14.400
Oh!

32:14.400 --> 32:16.160
That was my shin.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.840
Yeah, well,
Rome wasn't built in a day, Mrs M.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.000
Would you like to dance?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.440
Who knows when we'll have
another opportunity?

32:48.560 --> 32:50.880
You know, Sidney,
you're quite wrong.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.240
You are the perfect gentleman!

32:58.680 --> 33:00.000
SHE CHUCKLES

33:04.360 --> 33:06.600
Goodfellow, search the back of
the room.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

33:08.600 --> 33:10.360
This is urgent police business.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.600
Please remove your masks.
Immediately!

33:17.560 --> 33:21.560
The escape's surrounded, Doctor.
There is no escape!

33:21.560 --> 33:24.000
Inspector! Dr Muthomi,
I'm arresting you for...

33:24.000 --> 33:25.040
GRUNTS

33:25.040 --> 33:26.520
SHE SHRIEKS

33:26.520 --> 33:29.880
Oh, get off me!
Let me go or she dies.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.400
I need to have a word with
the patient.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.400
I had to see you again,
to make sure.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.640
Sure of what?

33:46.640 --> 33:49.680
Your wound - it isn't real, is it?

33:49.680 --> 33:52.800
Dr Muthomi faked it
with blood from his arm.

33:52.800 --> 33:56.240
Don't be ridiculous. Look at me!

33:56.240 --> 33:57.480
I am.

33:58.920 --> 34:02.560
I saw men with wounds like that
in the Great War.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.960
The blood kept coming until
they were drenched.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.160
Yours is beginning to dry.

34:09.160 --> 34:12.440
At first, I thought
that Doctor Muthomi stabbed you

34:12.440 --> 34:14.480
so that he could
escape in the ambulance.

34:15.840 --> 34:19.400
But why stab the woman that
he was avenging?

34:19.400 --> 34:22.840
Now I know that it was you who is
trying to escape.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.440
Think about this.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.920
Walk out of here or I kill her
and take my chances. Your choice.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.640
No, you can go. But not with her.
She's my protection.

34:31.640 --> 34:33.400
Elliot, please! Don't do this.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.240
Take me, instead.
I won't struggle, you have my word.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.280
Monty, no.
I'm not going to stand here

34:38.280 --> 34:40.920
and let him take you away from me.
Me for her.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.200
You and I leave together.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.760
No tricks? I swear it.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.440
Don't do this. If you go with him,

34:46.440 --> 34:48.480
he'll kill you as soon
as you're out the door.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.720
Better me than her. Monty?

34:50.720 --> 34:52.840
Felicia, I love you.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.640
I adore you. I always have.

34:55.640 --> 34:57.960
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
more often. Oh, no!

34:59.360 --> 35:00.920
Do what I say.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.320
And why, of all the people here,

35:03.320 --> 35:06.680
did he seek you out to ask
for acetone?

35:06.680 --> 35:08.720
Unless he knew that you were
the murderer

35:08.720 --> 35:10.800
and he wanted to warn you

35:10.800 --> 35:13.040
that the police had
found your fingerprint?

35:13.040 --> 35:15.040
SHE LAUGHS

35:15.040 --> 35:18.640
I'm hardly capable of murdering
a man with my bare hands!

35:18.640 --> 35:21.440
You didn't use your bare hands.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.560
Sir Charles' fingertips were
scratched as he fought

35:24.560 --> 35:27.160
to free himself. And upstairs...

35:29.800 --> 35:31.480
..I found these,

35:31.480 --> 35:34.560
and I remembered
the jewels on your belt.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.200
The murder weapon was hiding
in plain sight.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.480
No!

35:40.000 --> 35:41.960
God is watching you, Ruth,

35:41.960 --> 35:45.760
and he knows what happened.
And so do I.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.880
Sir Charles invited me into
his study.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.160
Said he was interested in
what I had to say.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.920
Then he came closer.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.000
The stench of whisky on his breath.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.040
I tried to fight him off, but...

36:24.480 --> 36:26.840
I couldn't sleep for weeks.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.920
I could barely breathe.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.120
Then I heard he was coming tonight.

36:32.840 --> 36:38.520
And I knew it would be my
only chance.

36:38.520 --> 36:43.040
Then why the death threat?
Why warn him he was in danger?

36:43.040 --> 36:44.680
A man like that...

36:46.120 --> 36:50.080
..I wanted him to know what it was
like to be afraid.

36:50.080 --> 36:52.080
And the sedative in his whisky?

36:52.080 --> 36:54.080
So he'd be too weak to fight back.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.880
When they found Sir Charles' body,
the doctor came to me,

37:05.880 --> 37:09.200
like you said.
Told me I had to escape.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.840
But they would only let you through

37:10.840 --> 37:13.240
the cordon if they thought
your life was in danger.

37:15.440 --> 37:19.960
I thought, if I killed him,

37:19.960 --> 37:22.200
it would make the pain stop.

37:26.280 --> 37:29.040
I can only imagine the pain
you have suffered.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.240
SHE SOBS

37:30.240 --> 37:32.480
But you must search your heart.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.680
Dr Muthomi risked everything
to help you escape.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.000
Can you let him hang for
the murder you committed?

37:45.640 --> 37:47.960
I won't hurt you. Now walk.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.960
You can't trust a word he says.
He stabbed a young woman.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.320
He murdered the Minister
of Defence.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.600
He did neither!

38:04.040 --> 38:07.120
I killed Sir Charles.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.240
I'm the Red Death.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.680
Why? Because he rejected you?

38:14.000 --> 38:17.640
No. Because he thought his power

38:17.640 --> 38:20.680
and privilege meant he could take
whatever he wanted.

38:20.680 --> 38:23.520
That he could live without
consequence.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.200
He was wrong.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.560
But Father Brown saw
the Red Death running from your

38:28.560 --> 38:30.440
bedroom while you were still inside.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.720
That was Doctor Muthomi.

38:32.720 --> 38:37.440
It was a ploy to prove that
Miss Moulton wasn't the Red Death.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.440
He gave me the slip, and then hid

38:39.440 --> 38:43.840
in the room where Lady Hakeworth was
sleeping. Is that not so, Doctor?

38:43.840 --> 38:46.600
I knew what Sir Charles did

38:46.600 --> 38:49.000
and I said nothing,
to my eternal shame.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.280
None of this is your fault.
You only tried to help me.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.440
But it's over now, so...

38:59.440 --> 39:02.440
..please, let Lord Montague go.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.760
WEAPON CLATTERS ON FLOOR

39:08.960 --> 39:13.760
Forgive me, Lord Montague,
Lady Felicia. I'd never harm you.

39:26.640 --> 39:30.360
Father, why have they arrested
the doctor? I told them it was me.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.640
Helping you try to escape made him
an accessory after the fact.

39:33.640 --> 39:36.760
It was my choice. I'm only sorry
I did not act sooner.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.840
What should I do?

39:41.840 --> 39:44.240
Tell the truth. And pray.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.960
Pray? A little late for that.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.480
It's never too late.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.520
Forgiveness and love
are always there for you.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.040
You wish for me to repent,

39:56.040 --> 39:58.680
but I can't be sorry that man
is dead.

39:58.680 --> 40:02.360
Do not let him cast a shadow
over the rest of your life.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.960
God will show you
the light if you let him in.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.800
Come on.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.040
Wait!

40:13.120 --> 40:15.720
I knew what he was, deep down.

40:15.720 --> 40:20.160
I wouldn't let myself see it.
I want you to know...

40:20.160 --> 40:21.840
I believe you.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.960
At times like this, one must be
grateful for what one has.

40:34.960 --> 40:39.200
So, my friends, my family,

40:39.200 --> 40:44.000
with the New Year nearly upon us,
I wish you all love and kindness.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.480
To 1954.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.840
ALL: 1954.

40:53.560 --> 40:56.880
Thank you for inviting me.
Most fun I've had in ages!

40:56.880 --> 40:59.920
INDISTINCT CHATTER

41:04.320 --> 41:09.720
Offering to sacrifice yourself
like that, it's awfully brave.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.800
If only I'd shown
a bit of backbone years ago.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.760
What would you have done?

41:16.760 --> 41:18.920
Talked.

41:18.920 --> 41:21.440
About the children that never came,

41:21.440 --> 41:23.760
the pain it caused.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.920
Instead I let it tear us apart.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.720
We both did.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.280
So, what now?

41:35.440 --> 41:39.400
I only ever wanted you to fight
for me.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.000
For us.

41:42.480 --> 41:45.520
I will, I swear it.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.400
Every single day.

41:52.720 --> 41:57.320
There are, um, things
I must tell you.

41:59.480 --> 42:01.120
Things I've done.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.280
It's New Year's Eve.

42:05.840 --> 42:09.680
How about we concentrate on
the future?

42:28.960 --> 42:31.560
You should take those exams.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.720
Really, sir? Thank you.
Why the change of heart?

42:34.720 --> 42:36.360
You're a good copper.

42:36.360 --> 42:40.760
Truth is
we need more inspectors like you.

42:40.760 --> 42:45.640
I only hesitated because...
I've got used to having you around.

42:47.160 --> 42:49.920
It'll take some time, sir.
I'm not the quickest learner,

42:49.920 --> 42:52.720
so you'll have to put up with me
for a little while yet.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.120
I'll cope, Goodfellow.

42:56.120 --> 42:57.200
I'll cope.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.320
HE SIGHS

43:02.320 --> 43:03.960
Well, that was an experience!

43:03.960 --> 43:07.240
Next year, I say we hit The Red Lion
for a few quiet pints instead.

43:07.240 --> 43:08.600
THEY CHUCKLE

43:08.600 --> 43:10.640
At least the storm seems
to have passed.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.560
Poor Ruth. What will happen to her?

43:14.560 --> 43:16.640
We'll pray the courts show mercy.

43:18.120 --> 43:21.880
I thought you might be able auction
that off at the next fete.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.120
A one-way ticket to New York?

43:25.120 --> 43:26.240
CLOCK BELL CHIMES

43:26.240 --> 43:28.480
There must be one member of the
congregation

43:28.480 --> 43:29.960
you'd like to see the back of?

43:29.960 --> 43:33.800
On behalf of the church roof
restoration fund, I thank you.

43:33.800 --> 43:36.440
I thank you.Right, are we all met?

43:36.440 --> 43:37.840
Yes.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.800
Oh! Aha.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.680
Five...

43:44.680 --> 43:48.400
ALL: ..four, three, two, one.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.920
ALL: Happy New Year!

43:50.920 --> 43:53.040
LAUGHTER, WHOOPING
