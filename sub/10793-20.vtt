WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:03.700
This is what Destiny intended from
the moment it entered the star system.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.500
We are going to survive.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.800
We are going to make it home.

00:09.946 --> 00:12.567
I'm telling you, the ship
came here for a reason.

00:12.568 --> 00:17.000
Destiny is powered by
the stars themselves.

00:17.001 --> 00:19.243
He and Young are bumping heads, yes.

00:19.244 --> 00:21.614
Not sure which camp is the better choice.

00:21.615 --> 00:23.217
We just pretend nothing happened.

00:23.218 --> 00:25.957
We need to be ready
for the next encounter.

00:25.958 --> 00:27.460
For the sake of the crew.

00:27.461 --> 00:31.935
For the sake of the crew.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.100
They're coming!

00:33.105 --> 00:34.507
Who's coming, David?

00:34.508 --> 00:36.244
The Lucian Alliance, they're
coming to take Destiny.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.947
They've got something to open the doors!

00:39.952 --> 00:41.287
- Take cover!
- Grenade!

00:42.623 --> 00:44.559
Fall back!

00:46.263 --> 00:47.197
You'll be okay.

00:47.198 --> 00:48.098
What happened?

00:48.099 --> 00:48.999
You were shot.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.135
You are surrounded.

00:50.136 --> 00:51.670
Lay down your weapons,

00:51.671 --> 00:54.241
or we will vent the entire
compartment to space.

00:54.242 --> 00:55.008
Can they do it?

00:55.009 --> 00:55.743
Yes.

00:55.744 --> 00:57.412
Then they should have.

00:57.413 --> 00:58.580
Rush, wait!

01:01.687 --> 01:05.555
We will not be complying with
your request to surrender.

01:06.556 --> 01:10.996
We have 12 missing, presumed
captured., including Riley, T.J.,

01:10.997 --> 01:12.531
Chloe, and Eli.

01:12.532 --> 01:15.568
I'm going to save every
one of those hostages,

01:15.569 --> 01:17.671
and I'm going to re-take this ship.

01:17.672 --> 01:20.007
Do you understand me?

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.194 --> 01:38.595
This is Young.

01:38.596 --> 01:41.999
We've got the medical
supplies you requested.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.104
We are prepared to give them
to you as a show of good faith.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.074
Thank you.

01:47.075 --> 01:48.309
One condition.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.612
You and I meet to make the exchange.

01:50.613 --> 01:52.548
Agreed.

01:52.549 --> 01:55.252
Let's do this.

02:00.223 --> 02:01.288
Brody?

02:01.289 --> 02:02.957
Ready.

02:12.665 --> 02:14.632
Remember, quick kills.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.568
Center mass.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.202
Yes, sir.

02:23.109 --> 02:26.111
All right.

02:26.112 --> 02:27.379
You ready to do this?

02:29.248 --> 02:31.516
We're ready.

02:35.588 --> 02:39.023
Bring the medic.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.135
Open the door.

02:57.576 --> 02:58.710
I'm in.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.327
Who's this?

03:15.328 --> 03:17.996
Ronald Greer is also a medic.

03:19.665 --> 03:22.000
Another offer of good faith?

03:22.001 --> 03:23.201
In exchange for it. Johansen.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.069
First things first.

03:27.406 --> 03:31.208
Go and check the supplies
and see they're what you need.

03:53.097 --> 03:54.497
Hold your fire!

03:54.498 --> 03:55.565
Don't shoot!

03:56.634 --> 03:58.067
No, no, no!

03:58.068 --> 03:59.635
Power just went out
throughout the whole ship!

03:59.636 --> 04:01.370
I can see that, Mr
Brody. Please step aside.

04:04.774 --> 04:05.808
T.J.

04:05.809 --> 04:06.809
Get behind me.

04:06.810 --> 04:10.245
She takes one step in your direction,
and I will shoot her myself.

04:10.246 --> 04:11.379
I've got the shot, sir.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000

04:26.300 --> 04:30.369
My men have been ordered to execute
the prisoners, if I am killed.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.204
Step back in my direction.

04:41.076 --> 04:43.644
Sir, I've got the shot.

04:43.645 --> 04:45.813
Stand down, Sergeant.

04:53.253 --> 04:55.654
Dammit.

05:01.693 --> 05:02.860
What happened?

05:02.861 --> 05:03.860
They surprised us.

05:03.861 --> 05:04.694
What do you mean?

05:05.896 --> 05:06.929
They surprised us.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.563
Do you want me to explain it again?

05:08.564 --> 05:10.198
The hostages are useless
to us if they're dead!

05:10.199 --> 05:14.701
At least they serve a purpose.

05:15.936 --> 05:17.036
Tell them.

05:17.037 --> 05:20.072
Tell them!

05:23.040 --> 05:24.107
Colonel...

05:25.142 --> 05:28.077
I'm here.

05:29.279 --> 05:31.210
She just killed Rivers.

05:34.615 --> 05:35.848
Understood.

05:44.892 --> 05:47.292
Hey, don't fall asleep.

05:47.293 --> 05:49.627
It's dangerous.

05:49.628 --> 05:50.761
That's a concussion.

05:53.298 --> 05:55.166
Okay, then...

05:55.167 --> 05:57.201
it's boring.

06:04.875 --> 06:07.242
So, what do you think
they'll do with them?

06:09.243 --> 06:10.912
Who?

06:10.913 --> 06:13.781
The prisoners.

06:13.782 --> 06:15.116
Probably drop them off on some planet.

06:15.117 --> 06:18.953
I don't know.

06:18.954 --> 06:23.256
I just hope everyone's okay.

06:23.257 --> 06:28.260
I just hope it's over.

06:30.329 --> 06:32.963
Well, not much we can do about it...

06:35.299 --> 06:37.801
So, rest time is over.

06:43.042 --> 06:45.810
Ah, this feels familiar.

06:48.647 --> 06:49.880
What the hell just happened?

06:49.881 --> 06:51.048
We still don't know.

06:51.049 --> 06:53.050
We're just getting systems back online.

06:53.051 --> 06:54.318
Then maybe we can analyze...

06:54.319 --> 06:55.419
Screw analyze!

06:55.420 --> 06:56.687
Fix it!

06:56.688 --> 06:57.321
We've got to know what's broken first.

06:57.322 --> 06:58.722
Do it now!

07:08.398 --> 07:11.199
Rivers is dead.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.734
What?

07:15.871 --> 07:17.672
Well, it was going to be someone.

07:23.778 --> 07:26.413
Would you prefer it was Chloe or Eli?

07:26.414 --> 07:27.814
Lieutenant Johansen, perhaps?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.883
Don't bloody tell me you
weren't thinking the same thing.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.718
I want you to figure out
what's wrong with the ship

07:32.719 --> 07:33.752
and fix it.

07:33.753 --> 07:34.887
Fix it now.

07:59.970 --> 08:01.236
I have orders to help.

08:01.237 --> 08:04.237
What's your name?

08:05.905 --> 08:07.704
Koz.

08:09.172 --> 08:10.806
I'll let you know what I need.

08:27.888 --> 08:32.927
You do know there is a way to save them.

08:32.928 --> 08:35.095
You're just not wired to consider it.

08:35.096 --> 08:36.496
I'm not surrendering this ship.

08:36.498 --> 08:40.467
And what exactly is so wonderful about it?

08:40.467 --> 08:43.370
We give up, she kills everyone

08:43.371 --> 08:45.272
except for those who have value to her,

08:45.273 --> 08:46.506
and let me tell you,

08:46.507 --> 08:49.143
that's not a hell of a lot of people.

08:49.144 --> 08:51.478
Colonel?

08:51.479 --> 08:53.513
This is Young.

08:53.514 --> 08:55.415
I would like to speak to the civilian.

09:10.194 --> 09:11.761
This is Camile Wray.

09:11.762 --> 09:14.764
Colonel Young has proved
that he cannot be trusted.

09:14.765 --> 09:17.098
Can you?

09:17.099 --> 09:18.499
Yes.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.533
Then why did you allow
them to plan an ambush?

09:20.534 --> 09:25.939
I voiced my disagreement.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.374
And you could not stop them.

09:28.375 --> 09:31.046
No, obviously not.

09:31.047 --> 09:32.814
For that, one of your men was killed.

09:32.815 --> 09:37.350
If you fail to live up
to your promise twice,

09:37.351 --> 09:39.185
I will kill again.

09:39.186 --> 09:40.786
Do you understand?

09:45.257 --> 09:47.025
No, I don't understand,

09:47.026 --> 09:50.294
But I do believe you.

09:50.295 --> 09:52.296
Then I would like to take
you up on your initial offer,

09:52.297 --> 09:55.432
with one modification.

09:57.135 --> 09:59.336
Four of your men for four of ours,

09:59.337 --> 10:02.404
and food and water for three days.

10:02.405 --> 10:06.274
Will food and water be
offered to the hostages?

10:06.275 --> 10:08.542
They're no good to me dead.

10:08.543 --> 10:12.946
Then we're agreed.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.885
Next time we take supplies
with us in the first wave.

10:21.886 --> 10:25.989
If there is a next time.

10:32.694 --> 10:33.527
Dammit.

10:33.528 --> 10:34.862
Flashlight, flashlight!

10:34.863 --> 10:36.431
What's happening?

10:36.432 --> 10:37.899
Well, I don't know, Koz.

10:37.900 --> 10:41.069
I'm up to my wrists in
somebody's body right now.

10:59.482 --> 11:01.114
Do we have any answers yet?

11:01.115 --> 11:04.048
Just the one.

11:04.049 --> 11:08.285
Every crash has been exactly
46 minutes, 37.4 seconds apart.

11:08.286 --> 11:10.120
So?

11:10.121 --> 11:11.120
Well, it'll be easier to show you.

11:11.121 --> 11:12.121
Brody?

11:16.993 --> 11:20.994
Okay, so, what am I looking at?

11:20.995 --> 11:22.863
That's our problem.

11:22.864 --> 11:24.097
It's a binary pulsar.

11:24.098 --> 11:26.632
It's the combination of
a rotating neutron star

11:26.633 --> 11:31.236
and probably a white dwarf orbiting
around a single point in space.

11:31.237 --> 11:32.638
What does that mean to us?

11:32.639 --> 11:36.841
Pulsars give off gamma radiation
and x-rays as they rotate,

11:36.842 --> 11:39.444
short deadly bursts of ionized radiation.

11:39.445 --> 11:41.445
The shield and the hull
are protecting us right now.

11:41.446 --> 11:43.047
Right, but the pulsar is literally

11:43.048 --> 11:44.314
feeding off of the white dwarf,

11:44.315 --> 11:47.351
stripping off material and
creating an accretion disk.

11:47.352 --> 11:50.287
And the white dwarf plows through
that material every orbit...

11:50.288 --> 11:52.190
Which gives off an even
bigger gamma ray burst

11:52.191 --> 11:54.559
on top of what we're
already getting hit with,

11:54.560 --> 11:56.395
And that's why our
systems are shutting down.

11:56.396 --> 11:59.965
The shield has to draw extra
power in order to compensate.

11:59.966 --> 12:02.168
And that happens every 46 minutes,

12:02.169 --> 12:04.505
37.4 seconds.

12:04.506 --> 12:07.175
It's what's killed their man,

12:07.176 --> 12:09.177
and it's going to be what kills us.

12:09.178 --> 12:10.678
The Lucian Alliance
just happened to dial in

12:10.679 --> 12:12.113
when the damn thing was in range.

12:12.114 --> 12:15.582
Destiny had to drop out of
FTL to make the connection.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.985
It's bad timing, bad luck.

12:17.986 --> 12:19.119
Well, then, why are we still here?

12:19.120 --> 12:21.088
Our FTL capability has been compromised.

12:21.089 --> 12:22.389
Compromised...

12:22.390 --> 12:24.424
Don't yell. We don't know why yet.

12:24.425 --> 12:26.492
The shield is what's keeping us alive,

12:26.493 --> 12:29.562
but sooner or later, it's going to fail,

12:29.563 --> 12:31.597
and when it does...

12:31.598 --> 12:33.699
We're dead.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.933
Yeah.

12:40.405 --> 12:44.400
The radiation burst is what's
causing the system malfunctions.

12:44.508 --> 12:46.209
Which will only get worse.

12:46.210 --> 12:49.878
Because the shield will
fail eventually, yes.

12:49.879 --> 12:53.714
Unless we can find a way
to make the jump to FTL.

12:55.282 --> 12:56.749
How much time?

12:56.750 --> 12:58.150
Well, according to Rush,

12:58.151 --> 13:01.886
we can withstand two more of the bursts.

13:01.887 --> 13:04.254
People will start dying by the third.

13:04.255 --> 13:05.923
I saw what one of those
bursts did to a man

13:05.924 --> 13:07.757
When he wasn't protected
by the ship's hull.

13:08.826 --> 13:11.461
First we'll make the trade,

13:11.462 --> 13:14.597
and then we'll discuss this new problem.

13:18.239 --> 13:20.174
Has their medic completed Varro's surgery?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.476
Not yet.

13:22.477 --> 13:24.644
Well, then, find out
what's taking so long.

13:24.645 --> 13:26.479
I'll do it.

13:36.956 --> 13:39.458
Lieutenant, she told me
to check on your progress.

13:39.459 --> 13:42.393
Tell her it'd be a hell of a lot faster
if the damn lights didn't keep going off.

13:42.394 --> 13:44.929
Well, that's a whole other problem.

13:44.930 --> 13:47.331
Destiny came out of FTL
within range of a pulsar.

13:48.899 --> 13:51.500
We don't have much time
before the shield fails.

13:51.501 --> 13:54.202
Colonel Young and his people
are trying to solve it, but...

13:54.203 --> 13:55.270
She won't let them.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.208
I'll do my best to convince her.

14:01.209 --> 14:03.543
You do that.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.523
Lieutenant Scott?

14:19.524 --> 14:22.726
We've got the supplies
that they requested,

14:22.727 --> 14:25.361
and we're ready to make
the prisoner exchange.

14:25.362 --> 14:27.864
Copy that.

14:44.844 --> 14:47.244
I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:47.245 --> 14:49.746
And Varro?

14:49.747 --> 14:52.550
I've done all I can for him.

14:54.886 --> 14:57.654
Hold it steady.

14:57.655 --> 15:00.323
Here, use this one.

15:05.328 --> 15:06.528
Will he live?

15:06.529 --> 15:08.763
I got the bullet out
and stopped the bleeding,

15:08.764 --> 15:11.265
so he should have a chance.

15:11.266 --> 15:12.733
I'd like to take a look
at the other wounded.

15:16.270 --> 15:17.470
Fine.

15:17.471 --> 15:20.473
Let's go.

15:32.417 --> 15:33.684
You got it?

15:33.685 --> 15:36.453
Camile? Camile?

15:36.454 --> 15:39.288
What's this?

15:39.289 --> 15:40.623
A flak vest.

15:40.624 --> 15:41.825
Just in case.

15:43.294 --> 15:45.729
How can I expect them to trust me

15:45.730 --> 15:49.599
if I can't even demonstrate a
willingness to trust them in turn?

15:49.600 --> 15:50.866
With all due respect, ma'am,

15:50.867 --> 15:52.768
I don't think they can be trusted.

15:58.307 --> 16:00.341
You tell Colonel Young
I appreciate his concern.

16:01.977 --> 16:04.312
Yeah, the Colonel said
you wouldn't take it.

16:04.313 --> 16:05.947
I just thought I'd try anyway.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.825
Are you sure about this, sir?

16:14.826 --> 16:17.493
No.

16:17.494 --> 16:20.361
Good enough for me.

16:20.362 --> 16:23.396
I hope you make a better
impression than I did.

16:38.611 --> 16:41.074
Commander Kiva, are you ready?

16:41.075 --> 16:42.373
We are.

16:42.374 --> 16:46.475
Brody, open it.

16:53.048 --> 16:55.049
Lieutenant, thank you.

16:55.050 --> 16:58.018
I'll take it from here.

17:12.498 --> 17:14.932
Okay, Mr. Brody.

17:33.148 --> 17:34.682
I asked for civilians.

17:34.683 --> 17:36.916
These are the two we had.

17:36.917 --> 17:39.384
We agreed on four for four.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.404
Four.

18:01.405 --> 18:02.738
What about Lieutenant Johansen?

18:02.739 --> 18:04.874
She stays.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.076
Even if we figure out a
way to jump back into FTL,

18:07.077 --> 18:08.811
and right now, the odds are not good...

18:08.812 --> 18:10.079
Then we'll be right back where we started.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.113
Yes,

18:11.114 --> 18:15.749
but this doesn't have to
end with one of us losing.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.484
If we could just figure out a
way to work with each other...

18:17.485 --> 18:19.619
I can see that you're someone

18:19.620 --> 18:22.189
who enjoys talking through problems,

18:22.190 --> 18:23.790
but if you don't solve this new one,

18:23.791 --> 18:27.694
then neither of us will
have anything to talk about.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.882
Brody.

18:54.552 --> 18:56.687
All right, get in the infirmary.

18:59.891 --> 19:01.458
Where's Chloe and Eli?

19:01.459 --> 19:04.595
She said they were the only two civilians.

19:08.099 --> 19:10.467
Then where the hell are they?

19:15.540 --> 19:17.207
It's gonna be just...

19:21.211 --> 19:25.546
Oh, sorry, sorry. Sorry...

19:25.547 --> 19:28.615
Take a break, Eli.

19:28.616 --> 19:30.050
No, no, no!

19:30.051 --> 19:33.152
We've got to be getting close by now.

19:33.153 --> 19:34.887
You know what?

19:34.888 --> 19:37.155
We should do this twice a week.

19:37.156 --> 19:39.924
This is the kind of exercise
that really motivates me.

19:39.925 --> 19:42.192
Carrying a wounded person

19:42.193 --> 19:43.960
the length of the whole ship

19:43.961 --> 19:45.895
in low oxygen?

19:45.896 --> 19:49.498
Good times.

19:49.499 --> 19:51.032
Thank you, Eli.

19:51.033 --> 19:54.034
Wait till it's your turn to carry me.

19:56.671 --> 19:59.638
You're an amazing friend.

19:59.639 --> 20:01.974
You can never have too many of those.

20:01.975 --> 20:06.701
Unless you're one of
those people on Facebook

20:06.702 --> 20:11.533
who just accepts
everybody's friend request.

20:14.101 --> 20:17.771
It's like, come on, you
know, be a little selective.

20:22.777 --> 20:24.177
Eli!

20:44.614 --> 20:46.681
Dammit!

20:48.517 --> 20:51.052
Sorry. Sorry...

20:51.053 --> 20:52.186
It's okay.

20:52.187 --> 20:53.187
Are you okay?

20:53.188 --> 20:54.254
I'm okay.

20:58.025 --> 21:00.527
Sorry.

21:00.528 --> 21:03.735
Okay, thanks.

21:06.076 --> 21:07.711
There's no sign of Eli or Chloe.

21:07.712 --> 21:09.114
You know, maybe they...

21:09.115 --> 21:12.252
There's no fatalities on
our side except for Rivers.

21:12.253 --> 21:14.187
They must be hiding somewhere.

21:14.188 --> 21:16.156
I hope so.

21:16.157 --> 21:17.357
Look, that boy would take a bullet

21:17.358 --> 21:20.326
before he'd let them
touch a hair on her head.

21:20.327 --> 21:22.195
Lieutenant...

21:22.196 --> 21:23.930
Don't get distracted.

21:23.931 --> 21:28.168
I'm not, I'm not, I just...

21:28.169 --> 21:29.403
I just want to get this done with.

21:29.404 --> 21:31.372
And I wish the Colonel would give the word

21:31.373 --> 21:32.407
so that we can go in there

21:32.408 --> 21:34.200
and properly resolve the situation.

21:34.476 --> 21:37.444
Look, he'll do the right thing
when the right time comes.

21:37.445 --> 21:39.813
You got to trust that,

21:39.814 --> 21:42.915
100%.

21:44.417 --> 21:47.051
I don't know how you do it, man.

21:48.554 --> 21:52.156
Well, you need to learn.

22:01.132 --> 22:04.835
Thank you.

22:04.836 --> 22:07.804
Your commander already
showed her appreciation

22:07.805 --> 22:09.071
by not killing me.

22:09.072 --> 22:12.139
It must be difficult to be forced
to save the life of your enemy.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.074
No.

22:14.075 --> 22:15.508
I would have done it anyway.

22:16.510 --> 22:17.876
How's the pain?

22:17.877 --> 22:19.210
Bearable.

22:20.479 --> 22:21.479
Look, I'm trying to say...

22:21.480 --> 22:23.146
I don't really care.

22:23.147 --> 22:25.147
I've been on my feet for far too long,

22:25.148 --> 22:26.349
and I have other patients,

22:26.350 --> 22:29.452
so excuse me.

22:37.226 --> 22:40.360
Conserving air, or unconscious?

22:43.163 --> 22:45.530
Just thinking.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.834
About what?

22:54.106 --> 22:58.408
I used to think I had a lot of friends,

22:58.409 --> 23:02.111
but I don't.

23:02.112 --> 23:04.981
They're a billion light years away,

23:04.982 --> 23:08.416
but they're still your friends.

23:08.417 --> 23:13.154
No, they don't really care about me.

23:14.856 --> 23:16.990
And I don't really care about them either.

23:16.991 --> 23:18.558
That's nice.

23:18.559 --> 23:24.396
No, no, because until I met you,

23:24.397 --> 23:26.264
I didn't really know what a friend was.

23:26.265 --> 23:29.868
Do you know what I mean, Eli?

23:29.869 --> 23:30.868
No.

23:32.270 --> 23:35.305
A friend is someone who will
support you no matter what.

23:37.307 --> 23:40.009
Like you.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.377
Chloe, why don't we...

23:41.378 --> 23:47.416
And I am not just saying that because
I feel like I'm going to pass out,

23:47.417 --> 23:49.450
and even if I do, I just
want to say it first...

23:49.451 --> 23:51.419
And you did, so...

23:51.420 --> 23:53.021
But whenever I say stuff like that to you,

23:53.022 --> 23:56.056
you always react like
I've just awarded you

23:56.057 --> 23:58.892
some runner-up prize,

23:58.893 --> 24:01.327
and it's not.

24:03.530 --> 24:08.066
I know. It's...

24:10.168 --> 24:12.602
it's just that...

24:12.603 --> 24:17.572
I know.

24:20.108 --> 24:21.608
Of course you do.

24:29.654 --> 24:32.556
Hey...

24:32.557 --> 24:34.490
There's a console over there.

24:36.926 --> 24:39.261
I didn't notice that when we came in.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.064
And it's got power.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.199
Can you call for help?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.601
I can try.

24:56.241 --> 24:58.208
Dr. Park?

25:00.577 --> 25:03.680
Look, it's not much of a solution,

25:03.681 --> 25:06.180
but we don't have to
shield the entire ship.

25:06.181 --> 25:08.315
Just the side facing the pulsar, right?

25:08.316 --> 25:09.415
Right.

25:09.416 --> 25:11.749
We'll have to leave some shielding
on the underside of the ship,

25:11.750 --> 25:13.348
but we should be able to
transfer something like 90%.

25:13.349 --> 25:16.116
Should buy us enough time
to restore FTL capability.

25:16.117 --> 25:19.652
So why haven't you guys done it yet?

25:19.653 --> 25:21.954
Because it can't be done
from inside the ship.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.189
Well, it could if we had
control of the core systems...

25:24.190 --> 25:27.091
No, no, look, look, someone's
got to have to go for a walk.

25:29.327 --> 25:31.528
I can tell you where to go and what to do.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.496
The mechanics of it are relatively simple.

25:33.497 --> 25:36.799
Well, then why don't you put
on a space suit and do it?

25:36.800 --> 25:39.401
Well, you get the FTL drive
back online while I'm gone,

25:39.402 --> 25:42.236
and you got a deal.

25:42.237 --> 25:43.337
We'll get it done, sir.

25:43.338 --> 25:44.672
I know you will.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.240
Gear up.

25:53.613 --> 25:59.249
They have only the time between the
gamma ray bursts to complete their work.

25:59.250 --> 26:02.018
The next one is less
than 20 minutes from now,

26:02.019 --> 26:05.022
so obviously time is an issue.

26:05.023 --> 26:06.624
So what do you need from us?

26:06.625 --> 26:11.663
There's a hull breach in the access
corridor that's under your control.

26:11.664 --> 26:13.765
It's the exit point closest to the array.

26:13.766 --> 26:16.368
We need you to let us in.

26:21.107 --> 26:24.442
Transfer control of all
the ship systems to us,

26:24.443 --> 26:27.578
and we will let them in.

26:28.613 --> 26:33.582
You do understand that if you
don't help us save this ship,

26:33.583 --> 26:35.350
we will all die.

26:35.351 --> 26:37.452
Oh, I understand completely,

26:37.453 --> 26:41.690
and I want you to transfer
the ship's systems to us.

26:50.724 --> 26:52.826
When was the last time you
ran a security sweep in there?

26:55.530 --> 26:58.232
Never mind, I'll do it. Radio?

26:59.233 --> 27:00.601
Calvos, this is Telford.

27:00.602 --> 27:03.872
Give me access to the damaged section.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.494
You tell me. You think she's bluffing?

27:32.495 --> 27:33.594
She doesn't have to.

27:33.595 --> 27:35.228
She knows who she's dealing with.

27:35.229 --> 27:36.329
But to be fair,

27:36.330 --> 27:38.897
you don't have much of a choice.

27:38.898 --> 27:40.498
At least they'll keep some us alive,

27:40.499 --> 27:42.467
for a while, anyway.

27:42.468 --> 27:44.468
Yeah, like you.

27:44.469 --> 27:47.003
You forget I've recently
been in their employment.

27:47.004 --> 27:48.605
I wouldn't envy me just yet.

27:54.578 --> 27:55.678
David?

27:55.679 --> 27:57.279
Yeah, Everett.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.881
It's about damn time.

27:59.882 --> 28:01.482
Listen, do it.

28:01.483 --> 28:04.251
Transfer control of the ship
and surrender yourselves.

28:04.252 --> 28:06.419
Everyone but Rush and Brody.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.855
Have them retreat to one of
the auxiliary control rooms.

28:08.856 --> 28:10.823
They're going to notice Rush is missing.

28:10.824 --> 28:12.291
Tell them he panicked and ran away.

28:12.292 --> 28:13.793
They'll believe it.

28:13.794 --> 28:14.961
By the time they start looking
for him, it'll be too late.

28:14.962 --> 28:17.030
At the first available opportunity,

28:17.031 --> 28:18.865
I'll access one of the gateroom consoles

28:18.866 --> 28:21.534
and transfer control of
the ship back to Rush.

28:21.535 --> 28:22.602
The second they find out,

28:22.603 --> 28:23.970
they're going to start shooting prisoners.

28:23.971 --> 28:25.472
Then I won't let them find out.

28:25.473 --> 28:27.841
Not right away, anyway.

28:30.277 --> 28:32.478
I won't lock them out completely.

28:32.479 --> 28:35.881
They can have control of the
ship until I decide they can't.

28:35.882 --> 28:39.353
They'll herd all of the
prisoners into one compartment.

28:39.354 --> 28:40.754
If they don't, I'll suggest it.

28:40.755 --> 28:43.290
When they do, I'll contact
Rush on this channel,

28:43.291 --> 28:44.691
I'll tell him which compartment,

28:44.692 --> 28:46.760
then he can vent the atmosphere
from all the surrounding ones.

28:46.761 --> 28:48.695
Where are you going to be?

28:48.696 --> 28:50.630
You let me worry about that.

28:50.631 --> 28:51.731
I got to go.

28:59.539 --> 29:01.973
It's all clear.

29:01.974 --> 29:05.710
Best not to stick around.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.813
This is Colonel Young.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.982
I am prepared to surrender
control of this ship

29:11.983 --> 29:14.818
provided certain conditions are met.

29:14.819 --> 29:16.720
Go ahead.

29:16.721 --> 29:20.690
I need you to guarantee
me the safety of my people.

29:20.691 --> 29:23.693
Agreed.

29:23.694 --> 29:26.462
Nobody gets hurt during the changeover,

29:26.463 --> 29:28.598
and no retribution afterwards.

29:28.599 --> 29:30.833
Anything else?

29:30.834 --> 29:34.370
That's all.

29:34.371 --> 29:36.872
Well, Mr. Brody,

29:36.873 --> 29:38.540
time to panic and run off.

29:38.541 --> 29:39.841
Hold on a sec.

29:39.842 --> 29:42.910
We just got a message from an
unexplored part of the ship.

29:46.881 --> 29:48.547
It's Eli. What are we going to do?

29:48.548 --> 29:50.348
Well, you got to go.

29:50.349 --> 29:51.382
Good luck.

29:51.383 --> 29:54.985
Yeah, you too.

29:54.986 --> 29:58.487
Transfer control to them.

30:05.461 --> 30:07.428
Anything?

30:07.429 --> 30:09.563
I wrote it in Ancient,

30:09.564 --> 30:11.864
so it could take a
while for somebody to...

30:16.470 --> 30:17.737
What is it?

30:17.738 --> 30:18.871
We got a message.

30:18.872 --> 30:22.007
What's it say?

30:24.110 --> 30:25.376
Oh, no!

30:26.678 --> 30:27.945
We'd better stay put.

30:30.614 --> 30:32.148
Transfer complete.

30:32.149 --> 30:33.549
Open them.

31:49.057 --> 31:53.159
No shooting. That's a good sign.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.794
I think the stitching is torn.

31:54.795 --> 31:58.698
You're moving around too much.

32:01.135 --> 32:03.236
I understand your anger
at losing the ship,

32:03.237 --> 32:05.071
but it wasn't really yours to begin with.

32:05.072 --> 32:07.173
When all this is settled,

32:07.174 --> 32:11.544
past sins on both sides
will have to be forgiven.

32:11.545 --> 32:13.880
Truce?

32:32.032 --> 32:33.165
Open them.

32:38.305 --> 32:39.972
46 minutes, gentlemen.

32:39.973 --> 32:42.241
Yes, sir.

32:47.113 --> 32:49.048
They're in.

32:55.321 --> 32:58.090
Attenuating the shield
strength in that compartment.

33:02.129 --> 33:05.899
Dialing back artificial gravity.

33:32.154 --> 33:34.355
Commander, one of the
power relays just went down.

33:53.773 --> 33:55.640
Something wrong?

33:55.641 --> 33:58.009
We lost a power relay.

33:58.010 --> 34:01.712
Then why aren't you dealing with it?

34:01.713 --> 34:03.780
Go.

34:03.781 --> 34:04.982
Go! I can open and close doors.

34:53.928 --> 34:55.428
This is it?

34:55.429 --> 34:58.030
Yeah, it's where he
said it was going to be.

35:27.596 --> 35:28.863
No, no, no!

35:28.864 --> 35:29.897
What happened?

35:29.898 --> 35:31.632
The transfers just stopped.

35:59.688 --> 36:01.856
What's the matter?

36:01.857 --> 36:04.825
It won't lock.

36:06.794 --> 36:10.095
Colonel Young, this is Scott.
How are we doing for time?

36:10.096 --> 36:11.830
14 minutes.

36:43.629 --> 36:45.764
This is Calvos.

36:45.765 --> 36:47.865
Kiva and Telford have both been shot.

36:49.933 --> 36:52.168
The commander is still
breathing but unconscious.

36:52.169 --> 36:54.703
Get them to the medic.

36:54.704 --> 36:55.838
Yes, sir.

36:55.839 --> 36:56.772
Is there any sign of the enemy?

36:56.773 --> 36:58.940
None.

37:01.877 --> 37:02.810
Where are your men?

37:02.811 --> 37:04.412
What?

37:04.413 --> 37:05.846
Your soldiers. How did
they get into the gateroom?

37:05.847 --> 37:06.647
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

37:07.849 --> 37:11.085
I've got people outside this ship!

37:14.122 --> 37:17.123
The enemy has somehow breached our lines.

37:17.124 --> 37:20.058
Both Telford and Kiva have been shot.

37:20.059 --> 37:22.126
I'm assuming command.

37:23.994 --> 37:25.527
Colonel Young, this is Scott.

37:25.528 --> 37:26.895
Ready to come back in.

37:26.896 --> 37:29.463
Lower the shield.

37:30.765 --> 37:33.933
I repeat, this is Scott, over.

37:33.934 --> 37:36.101
The shield is still up.

37:36.102 --> 37:39.004
We cannot get back inside.

37:39.005 --> 37:40.071
They just saved our damn lives.

37:40.072 --> 37:41.072
Lower the shield.

37:41.073 --> 37:42.106
Keep moving.

37:42.107 --> 37:44.441
Lower the damn shield!

37:46.211 --> 37:48.111
Lower the shield.

37:48.112 --> 37:52.214
Try a different channel!

37:52.215 --> 37:54.449
This is Scott. Please respond!

37:54.450 --> 37:55.783
Lieutenant, something's gone wrong.

37:55.784 --> 37:57.652
We have to find you another
way back inside the ship.

37:57.653 --> 37:59.154
No, no, no, there's
no time for that, Rush!

37:59.155 --> 38:02.156
Whoa, whoa, what other way is there?

38:06.727 --> 38:07.962
There's an airlock in the forward section.

38:07.963 --> 38:09.365
Yeah, we think it's an airlock.

38:09.366 --> 38:10.634
It's in a totally
unexplored part of the ship.

38:10.635 --> 38:12.238
Besides, we can't open it from here.

38:12.239 --> 38:13.474
Eli...

38:14.709 --> 38:17.612
Eli.

38:17.613 --> 38:19.213
Lieutenant, I need you to head back

38:19.214 --> 38:20.247
towards the front of the ship.

38:20.248 --> 38:22.049
Negative, negative!

38:22.050 --> 38:23.717
Listen to me, that's the way in.

38:23.718 --> 38:27.019
We're looking at the way in right now.

38:27.020 --> 38:28.888
You need to go there
as quickly as you can.

38:28.889 --> 38:29.955
Go right now.

38:37.594 --> 38:39.662
We're on our way.

38:43.099 --> 38:44.632
What's going on?

38:44.633 --> 38:46.767
I'm getting a message.

38:46.768 --> 38:47.834
What's it say?

38:47.835 --> 38:48.868
That I gotta go.

38:48.869 --> 38:49.936
What do you mean?

38:49.937 --> 38:51.237
I'm telling them where you are,

38:51.238 --> 38:54.606
so you'll be safe until they come.

38:56.842 --> 38:58.176
Where are you going?

38:58.177 --> 39:01.279
Whatever happens, you know, right?

39:01.280 --> 39:03.881
Eli, you're scaring me.

39:06.251 --> 39:07.818
I gotta go.

39:07.819 --> 39:09.085
Eli!

39:24.933 --> 39:26.566
Calvos...

39:26.567 --> 39:28.701
what happened?

39:31.237 --> 39:33.906
Come on...

39:43.017 --> 39:45.050
Separate the civilians.

39:46.886 --> 39:48.520
Take them to another compartment.

39:58.064 --> 39:59.965
This is Varro. What are you doing?

39:59.966 --> 40:01.566
I'm going to put an end to this.

40:15.944 --> 40:17.778
Bring their injured soldiers to me.

40:17.779 --> 40:20.380
Not if you expect me
to save your commander.

40:53.475 --> 40:55.175
They're not going to make it.
