00:13.947 --> 00:15.482
John Wilson:
<i>Hey, New York.</i>

00:16.616 --> 00:17.951
<i>When you go to a party,</i>

00:18.017 --> 00:20.854
<i>you never want to</i>
<i>show up empty-handed.</i>

00:20.920 --> 00:22.155
<i>There are a lot of</i>
<i>different things</i>

00:22.222 --> 00:24.624
<i>that you can bring to</i>
<i>express your gratitude</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:26.726
<i>for having been</i>
<i>invited somewhere.</i>

00:27.927 --> 00:29.062
<i>But if you're not careful,</i>

00:29.129 --> 00:31.564
<i>you can totally</i>
<i>misjudge the event</i>

00:31.631 --> 00:34.200
<i>and, and, and bring something</i>
<i>completely inappropriate.</i>

00:35.402 --> 00:36.970
<i>And then, you'll</i>
<i>just be embarrassed</i>

00:37.036 --> 00:39.806
<i>that you even tried to do</i>
<i>something nice to begin with.</i>

00:41.107 --> 00:42.942
<i>But the universal expectation</i>

00:43.009 --> 00:45.278
<i>is that you'll show up</i>
<i>with a bottle of wine.</i>

00:46.546 --> 00:48.715
<i>This may seem like</i>
<i>a simple task,</i>

00:48.782 --> 00:50.517
<i>but if you don't know</i>
<i>anything about wine,</i>

00:50.583 --> 00:54.087
<i>making a selection can be</i>
<i>a confusing experience.</i>

00:54.154 --> 00:56.990
<i>And if you make the mistake of</i>
<i>asking for a recommendation,</i>

00:57.056 --> 01:00.059
<i>you usually receive,</i>
<i>uh, a response like this.</i>

01:00.126 --> 01:02.429
So here, we have a Chablis.

01:02.495 --> 01:05.865
This is a Premier Cru.
So, there are nine Grand Crus

01:05.932 --> 01:08.101
and 14 Premier Crus
in this area.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.770
Uh, these tannins
are fantastic,

01:10.837 --> 01:14.107
especially when you
have some very bold...

01:14.174 --> 01:15.308
big foods, you know?

01:15.375 --> 01:16.776
Jumilla is interesting.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.678
They grow a grape
called Monastrell.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.513
But not all bruts
are the same.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.783
You have sort of a vegetal
characteristic to them.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.586
We always joke around
in the industry, you know,

01:26.653 --> 01:29.088
could you imagine that you
were in a place like Pomerol,

01:29.155 --> 01:31.057
and the folks in Pauillac said,

01:31.124 --> 01:33.827
"Hey! Were are you at
the Gran Cru meeting?"

01:33.893 --> 01:36.963
And they say,
"What meeting?"
"Oh, too bad!"

01:37.030 --> 01:39.399
(laugh) You know,
the wines in Pomerol

01:39.466 --> 01:42.602
are very, very good, and
they should be considered...

01:42.669 --> 01:45.071
Wilson:<i> And at that point,</i>
<i>you're half an hour</i>
<i>late to the party.</i>

01:45.138 --> 01:48.408
<i>So, you just grab something</i>
<i>at random with a nice label</i>

01:48.475 --> 01:50.143
<i>and bring it to</i>
<i>your friend's house</i>

01:50.210 --> 01:53.413
<i>and put it with the rest</i>
<i>of the other bottles.</i>

01:53.480 --> 01:56.216
<i>You try to have a good time</i>
<i>like everybody else,</i>

01:56.282 --> 01:58.451
<i>but you can't help</i>
<i>but wonder why your bottle</i>

01:58.518 --> 02:01.354
<i>is always the last one picked,</i>

02:01.421 --> 02:03.523
<i>and you wish you knew</i>
<i>what you did wrong.</i>

02:05.091 --> 02:07.861
<i>The world of wine may feel</i>
<i>like an exclusive club</i>

02:07.927 --> 02:10.396
<i>with a thousand</i>
<i>passwords to enter.</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:12.232
<i>But maybe if you learned</i>
<i>a thing or two,</i>

02:12.298 --> 02:15.468
<i>you'd never be stressed</i>
<i>about wine ever again.</i>

02:15.535 --> 02:19.172
<i>So, stick with me and I'll show</i>
<i>you how to convince anyone</i>

02:19.239 --> 02:21.941
<i>that you know a thing</i>
<i>or two about wine.</i>

02:22.008 --> 02:25.044
-(subway rumbling)
-(playing glass harp)

02:27.814 --> 02:29.182
<i>Now, a good first step</i>

02:29.249 --> 02:31.518
<i>is to learn a few select words</i>

02:31.584 --> 02:33.353
<i>of, of wine vocabulary,</i>

02:33.419 --> 02:35.555
<i>so you can sound like you know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

02:35.622 --> 02:37.457
(glass harp music)

02:37.524 --> 02:39.792
<i>Uh, a dry white</i>
<i>is a white wine</i>

02:39.859 --> 02:42.896
<i>with low sugar content</i>
<i>like a Chardonnay.</i>

02:42.962 --> 02:43.963
(clears throat)

02:44.030 --> 02:46.466
<i>If a wine coats your mouth</i>
<i>after drinking it,</i>

02:46.533 --> 02:49.702
<i>you can say it has</i>
<i>an oily finish.</i>

02:49.769 --> 02:54.173
<i>A popular kind of</i>
<i>red wine is a pinot.</i>

02:54.240 --> 02:57.210
<i>And a natural wine is made</i>
<i>with as few steps as possible</i>

02:57.277 --> 02:59.546
<i>between harvesting</i>
<i>and consumption.</i>

03:00.780 --> 03:03.016
(clears throat)
<i>Straight from the source.</i>

03:03.082 --> 03:04.817
<i>The legs are the drops</i>

03:04.884 --> 03:06.452
<i>that form along</i>
<i>the edge of your glass</i>

03:06.519 --> 03:09.389
<i>after you swirl it</i>
<i>around a bit.</i>

03:09.455 --> 03:11.858
<i>Some legs are a little</i>
<i>hard to interpret,</i>

03:11.925 --> 03:13.426
<i>but if you're afraid</i>
<i>of saying the wrong thing</i>

03:13.493 --> 03:16.129
<i>when describing them,</i>
<i>you can always just say,</i>

03:16.195 --> 03:17.564
<i>nice legs,</i>

03:17.630 --> 03:20.967
<i>and everyone will accept that</i>
<i>as an appropriate response.</i>

03:22.168 --> 03:23.436
<i>Nice legs.</i>

03:24.337 --> 03:25.872
<i>Nice legs.</i>

03:26.472 --> 03:27.574
<i>Nice ones.</i>

03:29.742 --> 03:31.911
<i>Supposedly,</i>
<i>the older a wine gets,</i>

03:31.978 --> 03:33.780
<i>the better it tastes.</i>

03:33.846 --> 03:36.883
<i>And a lot of the best ones</i>
<i>have aged for decades.</i>

03:36.950 --> 03:39.619
<i>But if you're nervous about</i>
<i>consuming a piece of history,</i>

03:39.686 --> 03:41.621
<i>a good idea is to</i>
<i>train with someone</i>

03:41.688 --> 03:44.724
<i>who's made a hobby out of</i>
<i>eating really old stuff.</i>

03:44.791 --> 03:46.826
MRE Man:
This is essentially
every generation

03:46.893 --> 03:48.194
of long-range patrol ration,

03:48.261 --> 03:50.830
up until about the mid-1980s.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.499
The experience of eating
really old, expired food

03:53.566 --> 03:56.369
-can go several ways.
-Wilson: Mm-hmm.

03:56.436 --> 03:59.238
If you eat something
that is really rancid

03:59.305 --> 04:01.040
and the oils have gone off end,

04:01.107 --> 04:03.309
it has this
very odd sensation

04:03.376 --> 04:05.111
that I'd never
experienced in my life

04:05.178 --> 04:06.546
up until the point
of eating something

04:06.613 --> 04:09.248
that's really old like that.
And that is a numbness.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.017
So, the whole inside
of your mouth,

04:11.084 --> 04:12.785
your tongue,
your throat, your gums,

04:12.852 --> 04:16.155
all that will go completely numb
and you can't really feel it,

04:16.222 --> 04:18.891
and it feels like your tongue
is swelling a little bit.

04:18.958 --> 04:22.729
This is going to be
most likely mid-1960s,

04:22.795 --> 04:24.764
'64, '65.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.166
So, this is definitely
a Vietnam-era ration.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.334
Wilson:
Okay.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.237
The back part here.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.106

Wow...

04:34.240 --> 04:37.377
This is the main entree
for the ration.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.312
It is vacuum-sealed.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.613
Wilson:

04:41.514 --> 04:43.383
Beef with rice.

Oh, okay.

-I wouldn't recommend it.
-Wilson: Um...

05:04.737 --> 05:07.340
I drank a SlimFast
that came from Big Lots.

05:07.407 --> 05:10.610
It was expired,
and I bought it expired.

05:10.677 --> 05:13.479
It was expired
at the grocery--
at the store.

05:13.546 --> 05:17.050
And, um, so it stayed in
my refrigerator for a while,

05:17.116 --> 05:19.585
and I took it to work one day,
and I drank the whole thing,

05:19.652 --> 05:22.955
and it was full of rust,
and it made me really sick.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.224
-Wilson: Oh, no.
-I had the worst headache.
