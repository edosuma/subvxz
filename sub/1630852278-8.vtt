WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:06.047
- Hey, there she is.

00:06.047 --> 00:07.924
Good news, you're not dead.

00:07.924 --> 00:10.927
-
Fuck you, Ed.

00:10.927 --> 00:13.096
- That's appropriate.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.597
How you feeling, though?

00:16.516 --> 00:18.935
Fuck.
You.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.979
- Okay.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.648
Well, you definitely didn't have
a near-death experience,

00:23.648 --> 00:25.734
or else you'd be way
more full of love right now.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.694
- Get out.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.862
- Yeah, that's good.
That's good.

00:28.862 --> 00:29.696
Let it all out.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.702
Mr. Becker, hey. Hey, she--she
seems to be coming around.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.037
- What the hell
are you doing here?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.581
- What--I-I came
to check on April.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.166
- Get out.
- Uh, yeah--

00:41.166 --> 00:42.751
- Out!

00:42.751 --> 00:44.669
- You know I wasn't
the one who knifed her?

00:44.669 --> 00:46.671
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay, for sure, for sure.

00:46.671 --> 00:50.759
♪ Now, now,
now, now, now ♪

00:52.927 --> 00:55.597
- So...she's okay?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.766
- Yeah, she's--she's okay.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.852
I-I mean she's not great.
She did just get stabbed.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.063
But the doctor said
it just nicked her colon.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.315
- Colon?
Nicked her colon?

01:05.315 --> 01:06.566
- Yeah, yeah.
Just--just nicked.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.359
- What?

01:08.359 --> 01:11.404
Is she still gonna be able
to shit through her ass?

01:11.404 --> 01:14.908
- I-I mean, the
first one might hurt.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.077
But, yes, no, definitely, okay?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.287
The doctor said it
was just a small nick.

01:19.287 --> 01:22.082
Like when you cut yourself
shaving, except the colon.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.875
- You got stabbed, too?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.960
- What? No.
This--this is from before.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.837
Garbage disposal, long story.
It doesn't matter.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.965
Oh.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.009
- Hey, cap'n.
- Ha, ha, ha!

01:33.009 --> 01:36.221
Ma, this is Mark and Fucky!
- Yeah.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.722
- Hi, Mark, Fucky.
Sorry, break's over.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.849
Move along.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.978
You realize the
sale is dead now?

01:43.978 --> 01:45.313
- What? No.
It's not.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.066
- Oh, God.
Of course it is.

01:48.066 --> 01:51.236
- Not--not, it's--
-

01:51.236 --> 01:54.531
- It's okay--yes, yeah--I can
see how--how it might be dead,

01:54.531 --> 01:56.282
but this is good, okay, Ma?

01:56.282 --> 01:57.408
Ma, you didn't wanna
sell this place anyway.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.743
You love it here.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.287
- I never said I wanted
to sell the company.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.915
I have to sell the company.
Didn't I tell you we're going
broke?

02:03.915 --> 02:06.209
- Oh, come on.
The market will bounce back.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.129
And those workers out there,
they depend on us, Ma.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.464
- Ugh, those dumbasses
will still have a job.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.466
It's us who will be fucked.
- But that's not true.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.386
I-I know what happens
when companies sell.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.097
And the first thing Roger Becker
will do is he'll cut the work
force in half,

02:19.097 --> 02:20.473
and these guys will be screwed.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.268
- We are the ones
who are gonna be screwed.

02:23.268 --> 02:27.021
Do you not understand?
We are broke.

02:27.021 --> 02:30.900
- How could I understand? You
don't actually tell me anything.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.903
- That's right I don't tell you
anything, because it's too
fucking depressing.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.697
But it's time for
you to wake up.

02:35.697 --> 02:39.159
Our business is dying.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.452
- I-I didn't know that.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.454
- Everybody buys
everything online.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.540
Nobody goes to a store
to buy things anymore, okay?

02:45.540 --> 02:47.125
Not even fucking tractors.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.128
It's big box bullshit
and Internet and--

02:50.128 --> 02:52.881
I missed the fucking boat.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.758
Ten years ago, I could have sold
this place for twice what it's
worth now.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.553
In five years,
it's gonna be worth nothing.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.389
So if we sell now, I can
give you a little something

03:01.389 --> 03:03.725
so that you can move
on with your life.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.518
- No, Ma, you don't have
to worry about me.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.061
I'm--I'm good.

03:07.061 --> 03:10.273
I'm honestly--I'm better
than I've been in a long time.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.025
- Are you fucking crazy?
Don't worry about you?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.068
I'm your mother!
I fucking love you, okay?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.404
You're all I've got.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.657
I'm still just worried that
you're gonna fucking end up like
your brother

03:19.657 --> 03:21.492
and your father, and you're
just gonna be miserable.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.536
- It doesn't matter
how I end up.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.705
All that matters
is--is how I end today,

03:25.705 --> 03:28.416
and today, I'm happy.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.834
- Today you're happy?

03:29.834 --> 03:32.170
- Kind of, yeah.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.838
- Bullshit.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.758
What in the world
do you have to be happy about?

03:39.594 --> 03:41.221
She's right.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.974
I mean, who am I kidding?
I'm--I'm banned from my dream
job.

03:44.974 --> 03:48.019
The--the love of my life is
getting married to another guy
in six days.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.605
How can I expect to
be happy when these--

03:50.605 --> 03:54.359
these massive sources of
happiness are gone forever?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.361
Not to mention my brother
just jumped off a bridge.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.030
W--are you texting?

04:02.825 --> 04:04.744
- No.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.038
- 'Cause I'm talking about
some important shit here,

04:07.038 --> 04:09.415
and it definitely looks
like you're texting right now.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.503
- No.
I'm taking notes.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.672
- Notes?
Yeah?

04:15.672 --> 04:19.384
So, if I--if I looked at your
phone right now, under the Notes
app,

04:19.384 --> 04:21.928
I'd find, like a detailed entry
of everything I just said?

04:25.139 --> 04:28.768
Ed, if you don't trust me,
how can I help you?

04:28.768 --> 04:30.561
- That's a good question.
Let me see your phone.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.273
- There you go again.
Worrying about the wrong things.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.442
You're looking to find joy

04:36.442 --> 04:38.820
in--in--in the big ticket items.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.281
You know, the showboat stuff.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.409
My girlfriend, my job, my car.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.536
That's not how it happens.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.122
It's the little, small
pleasures of life,

04:49.122 --> 04:50.957
the tiny moments.

04:50.957 --> 04:54.210
They seem so unimportant,
but every one of them is

04:54.210 --> 04:57.588
and they create...

04:57.588 --> 04:59.340
something that elevates you.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.384
It's like a--it's
like a staircase.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.136
It's the small things.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.891
- So, like--like yogurt?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.768
- I don't think that's
what I'm saying.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.521
- No, I mean, fro--frozen yogurt
used to give me that.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.981
The hap--happiness.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.984
- Really?
How?

05:17.984 --> 05:21.988
- Well, I mean, it did,
but then I-I realized that

05:21.988 --> 05:24.449
you know, after--after
I would finish my toppings,

05:24.449 --> 05:27.160
I would always fall into, like,
a slight dairy depression.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.039
- Alone?

05:31.039 --> 05:33.624
You rode out a dairy depression?

05:33.624 --> 05:36.961
- Do you know what I'm-- like
when you're eating frozen
yogurt,

05:36.961 --> 05:38.963
and--and you get depressed
'cause all the toppings are
gone,

05:38.963 --> 05:40.506
and all that you got
left is the dairy.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.550
The--the--the yogurt, and--
and so you just kind of--

05:44.844 --> 05:47.263
The--this--this is ridiculous.
What--

05:47.263 --> 05:49.223
- What is?
- You! This.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.517
Look for the small things?

05:51.517 --> 05:53.853
Don't--don't worry
about the big ticket items?

05:53.853 --> 05:56.314
How the fuck is talking about
yogurt supposed to help me?

05:57.899 --> 06:00.526
- Have you ever thought
of "bottomings?"

06:00.526 --> 06:02.278
- What?

06:02.278 --> 06:05.239
- You've rolled through your
life loving the toppings,

06:05.239 --> 06:08.326
but then, when they're gone,

06:08.326 --> 06:11.162
you're stuck in your muck.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.042
Your yogurt.
Your dairy.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.044
Your Vietnam.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.213
But what if you

06:20.213 --> 06:23.091
have placed toppings

06:23.091 --> 06:26.344
in your bottom?

06:26.344 --> 06:28.554
So that when you arrive there,

06:28.554 --> 06:31.557
what's waiting for you?
Toppings.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.768
Toppings more
beautiful than anything

06:33.768 --> 06:35.103
you could ever have envisioned.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.233
Bottomings.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.026
- Bottoming.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.414
Okay, I, uh, I gotta go.
Emergency.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.458
- Where are you headed?
- Back into the muck.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.960
- You did some great work today.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.130
Thank yourself very much.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.385
Uh, make a note

07:07.385 --> 07:10.263
to trademark

07:10.263 --> 07:12.515
the term "bottomings."

07:12.515 --> 07:14.142
Worldwide.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.195
- Wow.

07:26.195 --> 07:27.655
You look amazing.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.325
- Ed.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.910
What the hell are
you doing here?

07:32.910 --> 07:35.455
- I was just in the area.
Wanted to talk.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.622
- What happened to your thumb?

07:36.622 --> 07:37.874
- Uh, pinky.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.208
It's fine.
I'm tough.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.210
- How did you know
where to find me?

07:41.210 --> 07:44.464
- Yeah, you just Instagrammed
yourself in a wedding dress, so.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.716
- Okay, well,
what do you wanna talk about?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.304
-
- Oh, my God.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.681
- Kendra Allison Clark...

07:53.681 --> 07:55.266
will you marry me?
