14:13.458 --> 14:15.166
- I SAW THE NEWS.

14:15.166 --> 14:16.625
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS.
I HAD TO COME.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.125
- NO, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.667
- DEXTER, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ONE OF THOSE GIRLS.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.667
- LOOK, IT'S NOT SAFE
FOR YOU HERE.

14:22.667 --> 14:23.959
THEY COULD BE WATCHING.

14:23.959 --> 14:26.500
- WHAT IS THIS?

14:26.500 --> 14:27.500
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.417
- IT MEANS THEY'RE ON THE RUN.

14:29.417 --> 14:31.500
YOU NEED TO GO.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.917
- WILL YOU GIVE ME--
THANK YOU.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.625
SHIT A BRICK
AND FUCK ME WITH IT.

14:54.625 --> 14:58.166
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GUESS WHO
THIS TRUCK IS REGISTERED TO.

14:58.166 --> 15:01.125
JORDAN CHASE.

15:01.125 --> 15:06.250
- JORDAN CHASE
IS A VERY SMART GUY.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.417
HIS FIRST BOOK
MADE ME REALIZE

15:08.417 --> 15:11.208
HOW I'D BEEN PUTTING ALL THESE
LIMITATIONS ON MYSELF.

15:11.208 --> 15:14.458
I MEAN, I'VE LISTENED
TO ALL HIS CDs.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.333
- SO DID BOYD FOWLER.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.041
YOU THINK JORDAN COULD HAVE BEEN
DRIVING THAT TRUCK?

15:19.041 --> 15:20.125
- WHAT?

15:20.125 --> 15:21.792
NO WAY.

15:21.792 --> 15:24.250
FIRST OFF,
THAT JACKET IS NICE,

15:24.250 --> 15:25.959
BUT NOT THAT NICE.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.500
JORDAN WEARS NOTHING
BUT THE BEST.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.417
THAT'S PART OF HIS THING.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.542
IF YOU THINK YOU DESERVE
SOMETHING,

15:32.542 --> 15:37.417
THEN TAKE IT.

15:37.417 --> 15:38.875
[sighs]

15:38.875 --> 15:40.667
I'VE LIFTED TWO DOZEN
FINGERPRINTS

15:40.667 --> 15:43.417
AND THEY ALL SEEM TO BELONG
TO THE SAME PERSON.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.417
[sighs]
AND WHOEVER THEY BELONG TO,

15:45.417 --> 15:48.709
HE'S NOT IN THE AFIS DATABASE.

15:48.709 --> 15:51.500
DEAD END.

15:51.500 --> 15:54.583
OOH, A HAIR.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.625
AND ANOTHER ONE.

16:02.625 --> 16:05.291
[chuckles]

16:05.291 --> 16:08.709
- IT'S NOT OFTEN I'M IN
COMPETITION WITH MY OWN PEOPLE,

16:08.709 --> 16:10.792
BUT GETTING THE IDENTITY
OF THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK

16:10.792 --> 16:12.709
AND GETTING TO HIM
BEFORE THEY DO

16:12.709 --> 16:15.083
IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN GIVE LUMEN
WHAT I PROMISED.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.417
- ALL I GET
IS A FUCKING COMPUTER.

16:22.417 --> 16:23.959
I CAN ORDER JORDAN CHASE BOOKS.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.625
I CAN ORDER JORDAN CHASE CDs,

16:25.625 --> 16:28.792
BUT I CAN'T TALK
TO AN ACTUAL PERSON.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.000
- JORDAN CHASE IS A REALLY
POPULAR MAN, YOU KNOW?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.333
HE TRAVELS THE WORLD
GIVING HIS LITTLE

16:33.333 --> 16:34.625
TOUCHY-FEELY SEMINARS.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.458
HE'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN
IN MIAMI RIGHT NOW.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.125
- I'VE LEFT MESSAGES
ALL OVER.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.625
IF I DON'T HEAR BACK SOON,
I'M GONNA KICK THEIR DOOR IN.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.500
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ANYTHING?

16:42.500 --> 16:44.166
- YEAH, WE'VE I.D.'D TWO
OF THE GIRLS

16:44.166 --> 16:46.083
OFF THEIR FINGERPRINTS.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.166
ONE WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM WISCONSIN.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.500
SHE CAME OUT HERE ON VACATION
TWO YEARS AGO.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.834
NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.834
THE OTHER ONE WORKED ON A CRUISE
SHIP THAT WAS DOCKED HERE.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.709
SHE DISAPPEARED
JUST OVER A YEAR AGO.

16:56.709 --> 16:58.125
- WOW.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.709
- YEAH, THESE WERE GOOD GIRLS,
YOU KNOW?

17:00.709 --> 17:03.041
ONE WAS 26,
ONE WAS 29.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.625
- NOTHING ON THE OTHER THREE?

17:04.625 --> 17:07.500
- NO, I'M GOING THROUGH
THE MISSING PERSON DATABASES.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.000
PUT THEIR
PHOTOGRAPHS OUT THERE.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.375
- DNA?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.959
- IT'S BEING RUN NOW.

17:11.959 --> 17:14.166
LOOKING FOR DIRECT HITS
AND FAMILIAL HITS.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.667
- LISTEN.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.834
I HEARD ABOUT THIS TWO-BEDROOM
PLACE ON BRICKELL.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.792
UPPER UNIT,
RIGHT ON THE WATER.

17:19.792 --> 17:21.083
THOUGHT WE COULD TAKE A LOOK.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.667
- THIS IS NOT A WORKPLACE
CONVERSATION,

17:22.667 --> 17:24.125
SO PLEASE JUST SHUT UP.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.417
- ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IS THIS PLACE IS GOING FAST.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.125
- LISTEN, PLEASE,
JUST NOT HERE.

17:28.125 --> 17:30.500
- YOU TWO...

17:30.500 --> 17:33.208
NOW.

17:35.417 --> 17:38.083
- SHIT.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.208
THINK SHE KNOWS ABOUT US?

17:48.166 --> 17:49.333
IS THIS ABOUT--

17:49.333 --> 17:50.417
- THE SANTA MUERTE CASE.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.542
- OH.

17:52.542 --> 17:53.709
I THOUGHT THAT WAS DEAD.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.583
- WELL, NOW IT'S ALIVE.
BARELY.

17:56.583 --> 18:00.250
- YASMIN ARAGON, THE ASSOCIATE
OF THE FUENTES BROTHERS

18:00.250 --> 18:02.667
THAT SERGEANT BATISTA
IDENTIFIED,

18:02.667 --> 18:04.875
HAS ASSURED US THAT
SHE WILL BRING

18:04.875 --> 18:07.041
CARLOS AND MARCO INTO CLUB MAYAN
TOMORROW NIGHT.

18:07.041 --> 18:09.000
- SO WE'RE ON?
- WE ARE ON.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.250
- I AM PERSONALLY OVERSEEING
THIS OPERATION.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.542
WE CAN'T RISK WORD LEAKING OUT
TO THE FUENTES,

18:13.542 --> 18:15.792
SO IT'S STRICTLY
ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.

18:15.792 --> 18:18.792
RATHER THAN FLOODING
THE CLUB WITH POLICE PERSONNEL,

18:18.792 --> 18:21.792
WE WILL BE PERFORMING
A SMALL SURGICAL OPERATION.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.542
WE WILL TAKE THE BROTHERS
INTO CUSTODY

18:23.542 --> 18:24.792
BEFORE THEY GET INTO THE CLUB.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.208
- DETECTIVE MORGAN,
YOU'LL BE WITH ME

18:26.208 --> 18:28.000
IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.959
DETECTIVE QUINN,
WE'RE GONNA POST YOU

18:29.959 --> 18:32.333
INSIDE THE DOOR OF THE CLUB
WITH OFFICER MANZON.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.667
- I WILL BE ROVING,
PLACING MYSELF

18:33.667 --> 18:35.250
WHEREVER I BELIEVE
MOST EFFECTIVE.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.125
- IF WE'RE GONNA
TAKE THEM OUTSIDE,

18:37.125 --> 18:39.792
SHOULDN'T WE BE OUTSIDE?

18:39.792 --> 18:42.291
- IN ORDER NOT TO STAND OUT
LIKE SORE THUMBS,

18:42.291 --> 18:44.917
WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE POSTS
WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.792
THANK YOU,
DETECTIVES MORGAN AND QUINN.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.250
THAT'LL BE ALL.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.625
- MARIA...

18:52.625 --> 18:56.083
LET ME MAKE MYSELF VERY CLEAR.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.542
YOU'VE WASTED MORE THAN ENOUGH
TIME AND MONEY

18:58.542 --> 19:00.625
ON THIS CASE ALREADY.

19:00.625 --> 19:03.208
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A MASTER
MANIPULATOR OF THE PRESS,

19:03.208 --> 19:04.792
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE
TO DO THAT.

19:04.792 --> 19:06.959
EVERY DAY I PICK UP THE PAPER,
READ ANOTHER STORY

19:06.959 --> 19:08.792
ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT
DOING OUR JOB.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.166
GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME

19:11.166 --> 19:13.083
OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN
INTERESTING CONVERSATION

19:13.083 --> 19:17.625
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

19:17.625 --> 19:21.625
- [sighs]

19:21.625 --> 19:26.291
WHERE ARE WE
WITH JORDAN CHASE?

19:26.291 --> 19:29.083
- I'VE GOT QUINN ON IT.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.333
WE'VE MADE NUMEROUS CALLS
TO HIS ORGANIZATION,

19:31.333 --> 19:34.125
BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
REACH HIM PERSONALLY JUST YET.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.083
HE COULD BE
PLAYING HARD TO GET.

19:36.083 --> 19:37.583
[elevator bell rings]
IN THAT CASE,

19:37.583 --> 19:39.333
WE'LL PAY HIS OFFICE A VISIT
TO SEE IF, UH--

19:39.333 --> 19:42.208
- PROBABLY WON'T BE NECESSARY.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.166
- JORDAN CHASE.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.875
- UH, HI.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.125
- HOLY SHIT.
THAT'S HIM.

19:55.125 --> 19:58.333
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.125
- YOU TOO.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.917
- MR. CHASE?
OH, MR. CHASE.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.333
- STAND BACK.
- I, UM--I, UH--

20:05.333 --> 20:06.750
I TOOK ONE OF YOUR SEMINARS
AT THE BEACH CLUB

20:06.750 --> 20:08.291
A WHILE BACK.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.750
- SURE.
IN PALMETTO BAY?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.333
- YOU REMEMBER?

20:11.333 --> 20:13.041
- OF COURSE I DO.

20:13.041 --> 20:14.333
YOU HAVE TO EXCUSE COLE HERE.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.375
HE, UH--HE KEEPS
THE CRAZIES AWAY.

20:16.375 --> 20:19.041
- WHY DON'T YOU LET ME GET
A PICTURE OF YOU TWO?

20:19.041 --> 20:21.375
- OH, YEAH.
EXCELLENT. OKAY.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.917
OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.959
SMILE.
[camera clicks]

20:25.959 --> 20:27.208
UH, ONE MORE.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.959
[camera clicks]

20:28.959 --> 20:30.208
GOT IT.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.166
- JORDAN CHASE.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.709
- DEXTER MORGAN.

20:34.709 --> 20:35.959
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:35.959 --> 20:37.083
- WOW.
NICE WATCH.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.250
- OH, UH, MY DAD
GAVE IT TO ME

20:39.250 --> 20:40.625
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER.

20:40.625 --> 20:43.500
IT'S WATER-RESISTANT
TO 100 METERS.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.458
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I WOULD EVER NEED THAT,

20:45.458 --> 20:46.875
BUT IT SURE LOOKS NICE.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.166
- IF THAT'S THE WATCH
THAT LUMEN HEARD,

20:48.166 --> 20:49.583
I'LL MAKE SURE IT
ACCOMPANIES YOU

20:49.583 --> 20:52.625
TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE ATLANTIC.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.125
- MR. CHASE.

20:54.125 --> 20:57.375
- YOU MUST BE THE PERSON
IN CHARGE AROUND HERE.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.208
I WAS IN JACKSONVILLE.

20:59.208 --> 21:00.625
GOT AN EARLY CALL
FROM COLE HERE,

21:00.625 --> 21:02.917
MY HEAD OF SECURITY,
SAYING THAT ONE OF OUR TRUCKS

21:02.917 --> 21:04.125
HAD BEEN STOLEN
OUT OF OUR LOT

21:04.125 --> 21:05.667
AND THAT IT JUST MIGHT
BE THE ONE

21:05.667 --> 21:08.166
WE'D ALL BEEN WATCHING
ON THE NEWS.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.417
I FLEW BACK AS SOON
AS I COULD.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.458
- I SEE.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.333
- WE FOUND AN ARTICLE
OF CLOTHING IN THE VEHICLE.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.125
- MY JACKET.
IT'S MY PERSONAL VEHICLE.

21:17.125 --> 21:19.458
I ALWAYS LEAVE
MY THINGS INSIDE.

21:19.458 --> 21:21.417
- AND THE KEYS?
- THE KEYS?

21:21.417 --> 21:23.500
- YEAH, WE FOUND THE KEYS
IN THE IGNITION.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.542
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS
TO STEAL A CAR.

21:26.542 --> 21:28.834
MOST THIEVES DON'T
HAVE THE ACTUAL KEY.

21:28.834 --> 21:34.291
- I LEAVE A SPARE SET OF KEYS
ON A HOOK INSIDE OUR OFFICE.

21:34.291 --> 21:35.959
ALL MY GUYS KNOW WHERE
TO FIND THEM

21:35.959 --> 21:37.375
IN CASE THEY NEED THE TRUCK.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.291
HONESTLY,
THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.125
ANYONE COULD HAVE GRABBED THEM.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.959
- AND YOU'RE HEAD OF SECURITY?

21:42.959 --> 21:44.875
- [scoffs]
YEAH, COLE.

21:44.875 --> 21:48.417
I MIGHT HAVE TO TIGHTEN THINGS
UP A BIT, HMM?

21:48.417 --> 21:50.583
- [sighs]

21:50.583 --> 21:52.917
- I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT THE MIAMI POLICE DEPARTMENT

21:52.917 --> 21:54.625
HAS MY FULL COOPERATION.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.542
MY ORGANIZATION IS COMPLETELY
OPEN TO YOU.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.417
THIS IS A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

22:00.417 --> 22:02.750
PLEASE, ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP FACILITATE

22:02.750 --> 22:03.959
ITS RESOLUTION.

22:03.959 --> 22:05.458
- WELL, THANK YOU, MR. CHASE.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.917
- FIRST, WE'RE GONNA NEED
FINGERPRINTS

22:06.917 --> 22:10.083
AND HAIR SAMPLES
FROM ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.667
STARTING WITH COLE.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.000
- ABSOLUTELY.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.792
AND IF I COULD ASK ONE FAVOR?

22:14.792 --> 22:16.834
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF MY NAME
AND ORGANIZATION

22:16.834 --> 22:20.000
WASN'T RELEASED TO THE PRESS.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.291
BEING CONNECTED TO THIS IN ANY
WAY WOULD BE A P.R. NIGHTMARE.

22:23.291 --> 22:25.375
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.500
- AS LONG AS WE HAVE YOUR
CONTINUED COOPERATION,

22:27.500 --> 22:30.166
THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

22:30.166 --> 22:32.458
- SOCIOPATHS CAN'T FEEL
PSYCHIC PAIN,

22:32.458 --> 22:34.125
BUT THEY CAN FEEL
PHYSICAL PAIN.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.667
- OW.

22:35.667 --> 22:38.375
- SORRY.

22:42.166 --> 22:44.083
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT COLE?

22:44.083 --> 22:46.625
- "IT WASN'T ME.

22:46.625 --> 22:50.625
SOMEONE STOLE MY VEHICLE."

22:50.625 --> 22:53.208
THE OLDEST EXCUSE
IN THE BOOK.

22:53.208 --> 22:54.500
- STILL, IT DOES HAPPEN.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.166
AND MR. CHASE
IS VERY HIGH-PROFILE,

22:58.166 --> 23:01.125
WELL RESPECTED.

23:01.125 --> 23:02.750
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
SOMEONE LIKE HIM

23:02.750 --> 23:06.000
OR HIS PEOPLE WOULD BE INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.041
- I TOOK A FEW HAIRS
FROM THE HEADREST

23:14.041 --> 23:16.333
OF THE TRUCK AS WELL.

23:16.333 --> 23:17.709
IF SOMEONE ELSE WAS DRIVING,

23:17.709 --> 23:19.166
HE'D HAVE LEFT SOME
EVIDENCE BEHIND.

23:19.166 --> 23:20.709
- AND?

23:20.709 --> 23:22.709
- WELL, COLE'S HAIR
MATCHES THE HAIR

23:22.709 --> 23:24.250
ON THE JACKET
AND THE HEADREST.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.041
- FINGERPRINTS?
- THEY'RE ALL COLE'S.

23:26.041 --> 23:27.917
EVEN ON THE IGNITION KEY.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.041
- I THINK HE'S JUST
BECOME THE FOCUS

23:29.041 --> 23:30.458
OF OUR INVESTIGATION.

23:30.458 --> 23:32.542
- AND JORDAN?

23:32.542 --> 23:34.792
- HIS ALIBI HOLDS UP.
HE WAS IN JACKSONVILLE.

23:34.792 --> 23:39.709
SO FOR NOW,
WE GOT OUR EYES ON COLE.

23:57.375 --> 23:58.458
- LUMEN?

23:58.458 --> 24:01.250
- DEXTER, YOU NEED
TO ANNOUNCE YOURSELF.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.208
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING IN.

24:03.208 --> 24:06.542
- BUT IT'S OKAY TO HAVE PACKAGES
DELIVERED HERE?

24:06.542 --> 24:10.291
[package thuds]

24:10.291 --> 24:11.542
- I NEED THINGS.

24:11.542 --> 24:14.417
YOU SAID NOT
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.709
- AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH THAT?

24:23.709 --> 24:27.917
- IT'S JUST A FLASHLIGHT.

24:27.917 --> 24:31.667
- YOU HAVE A WAY
OF BENDING THE RULES.

24:34.458 --> 24:38.166
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE CASE?

24:38.166 --> 24:39.875
[keypad tones]

24:39.875 --> 24:42.959
- DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

24:42.959 --> 24:47.041
- OH, MY GOD.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.625
THAT'S HIM.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.542
THAT'S THE GUY
WHO FOLDED HIS JACKET.

24:51.542 --> 24:53.166
HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?

24:53.166 --> 24:54.792
- HE FOUND US.

24:54.792 --> 24:56.291
HIS NAME'S COLE HARMON.

24:56.291 --> 25:01.709
HE'S JORDAN CHASE'S
HEAD OF SECURITY.

25:01.709 --> 25:05.875
[keypad tone]
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

25:05.875 --> 25:07.834
- [sighs]
NO, I--

25:07.834 --> 25:09.083
I MEAN, THAT GUY'S
CLEARLY A FREAK,

25:09.083 --> 25:11.458
BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM.

25:11.458 --> 25:13.583
- NO, NOT THE BALD GUY.
THE GUY BESIDE HIM.

25:13.583 --> 25:14.709
JORDAN CHASE.

25:14.709 --> 25:18.834
- OH.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.750
NO, I DON'T KNOW HIM EITHER.
- YOU SURE?

25:20.750 --> 25:22.709
- I TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T SEE
MOST OF THEIR FACES.

25:22.709 --> 25:25.417
- [sighs]

25:25.417 --> 25:27.000
- WHO IS HE?

25:27.000 --> 25:30.750
- HE'S SOME SORT
OF MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER.

25:30.750 --> 25:35.500
- THIS GUY...
I DEFINITELY KNOW.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.875
WHAT NEXT?

25:36.875 --> 25:39.291
- WELL, THERE'S A PROBLEM.
THE HOMICIDE TEAM IS ON THIS.

25:39.291 --> 25:41.834
THEY'LL PROBABLY ARREST HIM
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS

25:41.834 --> 25:43.709
AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS,
COLE WILL NEVER SEE

25:43.709 --> 25:46.208
THE OUTSIDE
OF A PRISON CELL AGAIN.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.709
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUYS?

25:48.709 --> 25:52.709
- IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS OWN SKIN,
HE'LL PROBABLY TURN THEM IN.

25:52.709 --> 25:54.875
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY'RE ALL

25:54.875 --> 25:57.834
IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.667
BUT THIS IS FLORIDA.
WE EXECUTE HERE.

26:04.667 --> 26:09.083
THESE MEN WILL BE BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.291
YOU CAN WALK AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS NOW,

26:10.291 --> 26:12.500
PUT IT BEHIND YOU.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.083
YOU CAN GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.208
- NO.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.709
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

26:18.709 --> 26:21.792
- I PROMISE YOU THE POLICE
WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

26:21.792 --> 26:24.166
- NO, I DON'T WANT THE POLICE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.917
I--I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.542
- I KNOW HOW SHE FEELS.

26:28.542 --> 26:33.583
IT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT
FROM ME.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.583
HOW MUCH COFFEE
ARE YOU DRINKING?

26:35.583 --> 26:37.125
- A LOT.

26:37.125 --> 26:38.542
I HAVE TO STAY AWAKE.

26:38.542 --> 26:39.625
WHAT IF THEY COME
FOR ME AT NIGHT?

26:39.625 --> 26:42.375
- SHE'S STRESSED, ON EDGE.

26:42.375 --> 26:43.959
THE WAY I FEEL
WHEN I'VE GONE TOO LONG

26:43.959 --> 26:46.083
WITHOUT PUTTING SOMEONE
ON MY TABLE.

26:46.083 --> 26:48.583
- YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME.

26:48.583 --> 26:49.792
- I DID.

26:49.792 --> 26:51.250
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THAT HELPING YOU

26:51.250 --> 26:53.208
KILL SOMEONE
IS ACTUALLY HELPING YOU.

26:53.208 --> 26:55.000
- [sighs]

26:55.000 --> 26:57.291
THIS IS ALL I THINK ABOUT.

26:59.291 --> 27:03.500
DON'T BACK OUT NOW.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.041
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.542
- [sighs]

27:07.542 --> 27:11.000
TRUTH IS, I ACTUALLY WANT
TO HELP HER...

27:11.000 --> 27:13.625
[sighs]

27:13.625 --> 27:16.834
FOR SOME VERY COMPLICATED
REASONS.

27:16.834 --> 27:20.625
IF WE WANT COLE
FOR OURSELVES,

27:20.625 --> 27:23.625
I HAVE TO DERAIL
THE POLICE INVESTIGATION,

27:23.625 --> 27:25.959
WHICH MEANS GIVING THEM
ANOTHER SUSPECT.

27:25.959 --> 27:28.041
- WHO?

27:28.041 --> 27:31.291
- THE MAN WHO ACTUALLY KILLED
ALL THOSE GIRLS.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.667
BOYD FOWLER.

27:55.709 --> 27:59.834
HERE.
PUT THESE ON.

27:59.834 --> 28:01.834
FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO
IS REMOVE ANY EVIDENCE

28:01.834 --> 28:03.667
THAT YOU WERE EVER HERE
AT BOYD'S HOUSE.

28:03.667 --> 28:08.500
IF POLICE FIND
YOUR FINGERPRINTS OR...

28:08.500 --> 28:10.667
ANYTHING THAT TIES YOU
TO THIS PLACE,

28:10.667 --> 28:12.333
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

28:12.333 --> 28:14.166
TO BOYD FOWLER IS.

28:14.166 --> 28:17.125
HOW YOU GOT HERE.

28:17.125 --> 28:21.333
HOW YOU GOT OUT.

28:21.333 --> 28:25.500
- THAT'S WHERE YOU
FIRST FOUND ME.

28:25.500 --> 28:30.542
- WE NEED TO GO UP.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.709
YOU OKAY?

28:33.709 --> 28:36.834
I'LL BE WITH YOU.

28:50.291 --> 28:53.208
- [breathes sharply]

28:53.208 --> 28:56.709
OH, GOD.

28:56.709 --> 29:00.208
- YOU OKAY?
WE CAN LEAVE.

29:00.208 --> 29:04.709
- NO.

29:04.709 --> 29:08.000
HE KEPT ME TIED UP...
OVER THERE.

29:11.375 --> 29:16.792
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I WAS HERE.

29:16.792 --> 29:19.083
MAYBE A COUPLE DAYS.

29:19.083 --> 29:23.333
ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE BROUGHT ME
HERE TO KILL ME.

29:23.333 --> 29:27.417
- I'M GUESSING
THAT WAS HIS JOB.

29:27.417 --> 29:30.041
HE WAS THE FINISHER.

29:33.750 --> 29:38.166
- THE LAST DAY,
I CHEWED ON THAT ROPE FOR HOURS.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.750
I WAS FINALLY ABLE
TO SLIP IT OFF.

29:39.750 --> 29:42.875
THAT'S WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
AND I SAW YOU--

29:45.959 --> 29:50.417
- DO WHAT I DID.

29:50.417 --> 29:52.542
- [exhales sharply]

30:05.291 --> 30:07.625
IS THAT IT?

30:07.625 --> 30:08.750
- YEAH.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.709
I JUST NEED SOMETHING
OF BOYD'S TO PLANT

30:10.709 --> 30:13.500
IN THE TRUCK
FROM THE ACCIDENT.

30:16.709 --> 30:18.208
HIS WALLET.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.291
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT WAS THERE?

30:20.291 --> 30:22.542
- I PUT IT THERE.

30:22.542 --> 30:25.750
- HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE,
EVERYONE!

30:25.750 --> 30:27.583
I WAS GIVING COLE'S TRUCK
ANOTHER QUICK ONCE-OVER

30:27.583 --> 30:30.375
AND I FOUND SOMETHING THAT OUR
BLIND-AS-FUCKING-BATS

30:30.375 --> 30:31.709
LAB GEEKS MISSED.

30:31.709 --> 30:34.458
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
- A WALLET.

30:34.458 --> 30:37.250
HE PROBABLY HAD IT SITTING
ON THE CONSOLE AND THEN

30:37.250 --> 30:38.959
IT WENT FLYING
WHEN HE GOT HIT.

30:38.959 --> 30:40.917
I FOUND IT UNDER THE SEAT.
- COLE'S WALLET?

30:40.917 --> 30:43.000
- NO, THAT'S JUST IT.
IT'S NOT COLE'S.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.834
- WHOSE IS IT?

30:44.834 --> 30:48.333
- BOYD FOWLER'S.

30:48.333 --> 30:51.875
- WHO THE FUCK
IS BOYD FOWLER?

30:51.875 --> 30:53.417
[indistinct radio chatter]

30:53.417 --> 30:59.083
- I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.083
- CHECK IT OUT.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.709
THERE ARE LOCKS OF HAIR
IN HERE

31:03.709 --> 31:05.166
NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 12.

31:05.166 --> 31:06.208
- 12?

31:06.208 --> 31:08.000
JESUS.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.125
WELL, I'LL RUN DNA
ON ALL THE HAIR SAMPLES

31:12.125 --> 31:13.667
AND MATCH IT TO THE VICTIMS.

31:13.667 --> 31:14.667
- THE GUY THAT DID THIS--

31:14.667 --> 31:16.625
- DIED EXACTLY
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.834
- HEY.

31:18.834 --> 31:22.333
IN HERE.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.333
THE SAME EXACT BARREL
THE GIRLS WERE IN.

31:29.333 --> 31:33.041
- JESUS.
WHAT'D HE DO WITH THESE?

31:33.041 --> 31:34.542
- THE PRELIMINARY
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S REPORT

31:34.542 --> 31:35.959
SAID ALL THE GIRLS
WERE ELECTROCUTED.

31:35.959 --> 31:38.208
- WE'RE GONNA NEED FORENSICS
IN THE ATTIC.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.709
I THINK HE KEPT
THE GIRLS UP THERE.

31:40.709 --> 31:44.250
- IT LOOKS LIKE BOYD FOWLER
HAS BECOME OUR PRIMARY FOCUS.

31:48.917 --> 31:51.875
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

31:51.875 --> 31:54.208
- NO.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.875
- WELL, HE KNOWS YOU.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.792
HE HAS ALL YOUR BOOKS
AND CDs IN HIS HOUSE.

31:58.792 --> 32:01.333
- [stammers]

32:01.333 --> 32:04.375
I'VE SOLD OVER A MILLION
COPIES OF MY BOOK.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.667
ALMOST AS MANY CDs.

32:05.667 --> 32:07.709
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

32:07.709 --> 32:09.375
HOW HE CAME TO BE DRIVING
YOUR TRUCK.

32:09.375 --> 32:11.583
- [sighs]

32:11.583 --> 32:13.583
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT--

32:13.583 --> 32:16.333
- I KNOW HIM.
BOYD FOWLER.

32:16.333 --> 32:19.917
HE WAS ONE OF YOUR STALKERS.

32:19.917 --> 32:23.083
- AND HOW COME I'M
JUST NOW HEARING THIS?

32:23.083 --> 32:25.458
- NO REASON TO TELL YOU ABOUT
EVERY NUT THAT PASSES THROUGH.

32:25.458 --> 32:28.250
HE NEVER SEEMED
LIKE A SERIOUS THREAT.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.000
HE TOOK A FEW SEMINARS
A WHILE BACK

32:30.000 --> 32:31.750
AND THEN STARTED SHOWING UP
AT OUR OFFICE

32:31.750 --> 32:33.667
ASKING FOR MR. CHASE.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.709
I HAD TO ESCORT HIM OFF
THE PREMISES A FEW TIMES.

32:35.709 --> 32:36.959
HE WAS CLEARLY A BIT OFF,

32:36.959 --> 32:38.750
BUT HE NEVER STRUCK
ME AS DANGEROUS.

32:38.750 --> 32:42.583
- HE'S DANGEROUS.

32:42.583 --> 32:47.542
- HE'D BEEN IN AND OUT
OF OUR OFFICES ENOUGH TIMES.

32:47.542 --> 32:49.583
PROBABLY SAW WHERE
I PUT THE KEYS.

32:49.583 --> 32:51.959
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU
HAD CONTACT WITH HIM?

32:51.959 --> 32:55.458
- HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
FOR A WHILE.

32:55.458 --> 32:56.750
COUPLE OF MONTHS MAYBE.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.667
- ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT BE?

32:58.667 --> 33:02.125
- NO.

33:02.125 --> 33:05.959
- WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR HIS ARREST.

33:05.959 --> 33:09.458
I SUGGEST THAT YOU BE ESPECIALLY
CAUTIOUS, MR. CHASE,

33:09.458 --> 33:11.125
BECAUSE IF HE HAS
A THING FOR YOU,

33:11.125 --> 33:12.458
YOU COULD BE IN DANGER.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.750
- NOTED.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.125
- NOW, IF YOU HAVE
ANY CONTACT WITH HIM,

33:16.125 --> 33:18.500
PLEASE GET IN TOUCH
WITH US IMMEDIATELY.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.125
THIS GUY IS VERY BAD NEWS.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.542
- I WILL.

33:23.542 --> 33:24.625
- THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

33:24.625 --> 33:27.709
I APPRECIATE IT.

33:50.166 --> 33:52.834
- YOU FINALLY
DID SOMETHING RIGHT.

33:52.834 --> 33:54.750
STEERING THE COPS TOWARD BOYD.

33:54.750 --> 33:57.417
VERY SMART.

33:57.417 --> 33:59.500
- IT WASN'T ME.

34:04.834 --> 34:10.542
- DADDY'S GOING
TO BOCA RATON TONIGHT.

34:10.542 --> 34:14.291
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHERE COLE HARMON LIVES.

34:14.291 --> 34:17.959
HE'S A BAD MAN.

34:17.959 --> 34:20.166
AND I'M GONNA TRY
TO FIND OUT

34:20.166 --> 34:23.041
WHO THE REST OF HIS BAD MAN
FRIENDS ARE.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.917
YOU WANT THAT?
[knock on door]

34:24.917 --> 34:26.625
[door opens]

34:26.625 --> 34:28.208
- HI.

34:28.208 --> 34:31.000
THERE'S MY ANGEL.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.959
LET ME JUST SET
MY THINGS DOWN.

34:35.959 --> 34:37.834
- WONDER HOW MUCH LONGER
I'M GONNA BE ABLE

34:37.834 --> 34:39.125
TO TALK TO YOU LIKE THIS.

34:39.125 --> 34:43.208
SOON YOU'RE GONNA START
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

34:43.208 --> 34:46.041
- HARRISON CLEARLY LOVES
HIS SAINT BRIGID.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.750
HE PUT IT WITH HIS
FAVORITE TOYS.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.834
- I PUT THAT IN THE TOY BOX.

34:49.834 --> 34:51.291
- SORRY?

34:51.291 --> 34:52.750
- IT'S JUST A STATUE
OF A LADY

34:52.750 --> 34:53.917
WHO DIED A LONG TIME AGO.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.625
SHE DOESN'T PROTECT ANYBODY
OR ANYTHING.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.834
I SHOULD GET TO WORK.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.333
HERE.
GO TO SONYA.

34:59.333 --> 35:04.375
OH.

35:04.375 --> 35:07.917
- IT'S JUST THIS CAN BE
A VERY DARK WORLD AT TIMES,

35:07.917 --> 35:09.834
AND SINCE DEAR BRIGID HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A COMFORT TO ME,

35:09.834 --> 35:11.500
I THOUGHT HARRISON MIGHT
FEEL THE SAME.

35:11.500 --> 35:14.417
I HOPE FOR HIS SAKE,
YOU'D RECONSIDER.

35:14.417 --> 35:18.000
- SURE.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.125
BYE, BUDDY.

35:20.125 --> 35:21.875
[door opens]

35:21.875 --> 35:25.750
- SO, UH...
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING TONIGHT?

35:25.750 --> 35:27.250
- TO THE BIG STAKEOUT?

35:27.250 --> 35:30.166
UM, A DIAPER PROBABLY.

35:30.166 --> 35:31.792
- [laughs]

35:31.792 --> 35:32.959
- I'LL HAVE TO SIT
IN THAT VAN

35:32.959 --> 35:35.083
WITH BATISTA FOR HOURS.

35:35.083 --> 35:37.959
WILL YOU PLEASE NOT WEAR
THAT AWFUL SHIRT

35:37.959 --> 35:39.417
WITH THE PATTERNS ALL OVER IT?

35:39.417 --> 35:41.000
IT REALLY MAKES ME DIZZY.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.166
- NO, I, UH, ONLY WORE
THAT AS A JOKE.

35:44.166 --> 35:45.583
[knock on door]
