IT'S A STING.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.882
{\an1}WE'VE BEEN WAITING HERE
FOR 20 YEARS

19:34.965 --> 19:36.425
FOR YOU TO PICK UP
THAT KIDDIE PORN.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.093
AH HA HA!
LOOKS LIKE I WIN.

19:38.176 --> 19:40.262
I KNEW YOU WERE MESSING
WITH ME AGAIN,

19:40.345 --> 19:41.555
BUT I OUTSMARTED YOU.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.765
SERVES YOU RIGHT
FOR WANTING TO SEE

19:43.849 --> 19:46.268
A YOUNG BOY'S PENIS
IN A SANDWICH. FACE!

19:46.351 --> 19:47.477
TAKE HIM AWAY, BOYS.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.521
AWW! CAN I LEAST
KEEP THE PHOTO?

19:49.605 --> 19:53.483
{\an5}IT'S THE ONLY PICTURE
I HAVE OF MY PENIS
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.946
ACCIDENT?
WHAT ACCIDENT?

19:58.030 --> 19:58.697
NEVER YOU MIND.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.198
WE ARE DONE TALKING,
NIPPLE.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.950
AS AN ASSHOLE
ON A WALKIE-TALKIE

20:02.034 --> 20:03.076
ONCE SAID TO ME
WHEN I WAS 12,

20:03.160 --> 20:06.121
GO SCREW
A GARBAGE DISPOSAL!

20:06.204 --> 20:07.122
{\an8}A GARBAGE DISPOSAL?

20:07.205 --> 20:11.126
{\an8}OH, SAY, THAT MIGHT
FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.003
OH, YEAH, BABY.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.464
I'M GONNA FEEL THE RAINS
DOWN IN AFRICA.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.465
NA-NU NA-NU.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.800
OOH. WHAT IS
THIS SWITCH FOR?

20:18.884 --> 20:20.969
[GRINDING]

20:18.884 --> 20:20.969
