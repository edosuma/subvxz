PETER: Oh, I know.

30:28.654 --> 30:30.033
I'm sorry-- Agnes?

30:30.033 --> 30:31.828
You know, I asked her
to take that down

30:31.828 --> 30:33.581
because it is so morbid.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.959
- Oh, I like it.
- Me too.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.670
I like it.

30:42.015 --> 30:43.267

from <i>Kung Fu</i>.

30:47.317 --> 30:49.029
Is that okay?
Good.

30:49.029 --> 30:50.532
Hi Peter, I'm Morgan.

30:50.532 --> 30:52.327
Hello.

30:52.327 --> 30:53.789
Marie and I met backpacking

30:53.789 --> 30:55.208
across Devon.

30:55.208 --> 30:57.170
Bonded over the last bag
of trail mix

30:57.170 --> 30:58.339
and here I am.

30:58.339 --> 31:01.053
Supplementing the nups
with a touch of class.

31:01.053 --> 31:02.723
Touch.
PETER: Oh, that's nice.

31:02.723 --> 31:03.725
I bet you've got tons of that

31:03.725 --> 31:05.437
despite your--your fragile stature.

31:07.482 --> 31:08.735
Lovely home.

31:08.735 --> 31:09.570
Thank you.

31:09.570 --> 31:11.490
Architecturally speaking.

31:11.490 --> 31:14.204
Style wise, I can't say
I really care for it.

31:14.204 --> 31:14.956
Mm-hm.

31:14.956 --> 31:16.250
Muddled at best.

Second, are you gonna feed us

31:47.772 --> 31:49.608
I mean, that's why you should
just have the wedding

31:49.608 --> 31:50.778
in, like, a barn of something.

31:50.778 --> 31:52.280
- A barn?
- But not, like, an actual barn.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.491

31:54.493 --> 31:55.662

31:55.662 --> 31:58.292
- Me? Uh, well...
- Yeah.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.419
...to be honest with you guys,

31:59.419 --> 32:01.590
I have no idea
what the gentle fuck

32:01.590 --> 32:02.885
you're talkin' about.

32:02.885 --> 32:04.221

32:04.221 --> 32:05.891

32:07.853 --> 32:09.606
PETER: For those of you willing,

32:09.606 --> 32:11.778
what you're about to enjoy...

32:11.778 --> 32:13.907
is a pan-seared monkfish.

32:13.907 --> 32:15.786
You'll see some English peas.

32:15.786 --> 32:16.913
Those are fresh.

32:16.913 --> 32:19.042
KARA: Oh my gosh,
this is beautiful.

32:19.042 --> 32:20.420
I mean, it looks like cod.

32:20.420 --> 32:22.299
PETER: There's a similarity.

32:22.299 --> 32:23.634
- Mm.
PETER: Uh, Elena,

32:23.634 --> 32:25.054
but, um, it's much higher end.

32:25.054 --> 32:26.640
Y'all, eat up, eat up also,

32:26.640 --> 32:29.146
because this is super expensive
at his restaurant.

32:29.146 --> 32:31.066
The reason I broke up with him
mainly

32:31.066 --> 32:33.446
was because he thought
he got to decide

32:33.446 --> 32:35.033
when and if I had babies.

32:35.033 --> 32:36.577
But also the salt, no?

32:36.577 --> 32:37.830
Also he salted his bacon.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.082
Oh, that's always gross.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.585
- Fuck no.

Mm-mm.

32:41.337 --> 32:42.213
MORGAN:
But it wasn't as bad

32:42.213 --> 32:44.009

wanting to determine

32:44.927 --> 32:46.430
when my body transforms

32:46.430 --> 32:49.019
and bursts forth with...

32:49.019 --> 32:50.521
suckling young.
PETER: Goodness gracious,

32:50.521 --> 32:52.943
you make it sound like
the last act of <i>Akira</i>, Morgan.

32:52.943 --> 32:54.196
It's not that bad.

32:54.196 --> 32:57.410
I'm sorry, Peter,
have you birthed many children?

32:57.410 --> 32:59.206
Um, I haven't, unfortunately,

32:59.206 --> 33:00.333
but I did see it happen.

33:00.333 --> 33:02.337
Listen, I saw it happen
up close and personal,

33:02.337 --> 33:05.928
and I feel like
if I had the gadgetry,

33:05.928 --> 33:07.097
I would have delivered.

33:07.097 --> 33:09.101
The gadgetry, you guys.

33:09.101 --> 33:11.480
LILITH: You know, it's not just
the delivery, right?

33:11.480 --> 33:12.691
It's everything that comes next

33:12.691 --> 33:14.821
and then everything after that.

33:14.821 --> 33:16.866
PETER: You're right, I'm sorry,
I forgot that you managed

33:16.866 --> 33:17.868
to avoid the pushing part,

33:17.868 --> 33:19.997
which is so sweet for you,
it's rad.

33:19.997 --> 33:23.003
But I'm also a fan of adoption, so...
- (Lilith sighs)

33:23.003 --> 33:24.882
No, I was just saying
I don't think raising a child

33:24.882 --> 33:27.595
should be another thing we
have to prioritize, you know?

33:27.595 --> 33:29.057
It's not a burden or a task,

33:29.057 --> 33:32.230
it's just simply what is.

33:32.230 --> 33:34.861
Becomes as much part
of your life as breathing.

33:34.861 --> 33:36.740
But then the parts of your life

33:36.740 --> 33:38.451
that you thought were your life,

33:38.451 --> 33:41.875
like socializing
or career building,

33:41.875 --> 33:45.131
and, you know, exploring
or expressing art,

33:45.131 --> 33:49.514

get left unchecked.

33:52.270 --> 33:54.524
Of course they still matter.

to grow up

33:57.155 --> 34:00.536

You want them to see a dreamer
