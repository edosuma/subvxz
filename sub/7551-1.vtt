00:01.780 --> 00:03.355
Previously on "Castle"...

00:03.375 --> 00:05.639
- We're getting married!
- How close are you?

00:05.659 --> 00:07.810
I got our marriage license in my pocket.

00:07.830 --> 00:09.655
I will be there soon.

00:10.908 --> 00:12.463
[Engine revs]

00:18.048 --> 00:19.946
Yes. This is she.

[Grunts]

00:38.962 --> 00:39.982
Ryan: Beckett!

00:40.002 --> 00:40.675
Castle.

00:40.695 --> 00:43.033
Stay back! There's nothing you can do!

00:43.186 --> 00:44.987
[Grunts]

00:46.289 --> 00:48.790
[Grunting]

00:56.265 --> 00:57.903
Oh, my God!

01:01.340 --> 01:03.138
[Voice breaking] Castle.

01:57.110 --> 01:57.805
It's empty.

01:59.046 --> 02:00.726
He's not here.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.781
He's not in the car!

02:03.444 --> 02:04.635
You sure he's not in the car?

02:04.655 --> 02:07.807
Even with a fire that hot,
there'd still be a body.

02:08.344 --> 02:09.676
He's got to be nearby.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.357
- You really think he...
- He's here. He has to be.

02:12.377 --> 02:15.214
- We have to start a search.
- We could use more men.

02:15.698 --> 02:16.684
Sergeant!

02:16.704 --> 02:18.627
I'm Detective Beckett, NYPD.

02:18.647 --> 02:20.915
The man that was in that
car is one of our own.

02:20.935 --> 02:23.446
- We need to scrub every inch of this area.
- I'll get my men on it.

02:23.466 --> 02:25.308
You have search-and-rescue dogs?
I'll call them in.

02:25.328 --> 02:26.395
Okay.

02:28.417 --> 02:29.641
I need to help them.

02:29.661 --> 02:31.329
Esposito:
You're no use to anyone dressed like that.

02:31.349 --> 02:32.731
We'll get started here. You go change.

02:32.751 --> 02:34.990
Come on.
Let's get you into some other clothes.

02:35.010 --> 02:36.912
Okay, I'll be right back.

02:37.620 --> 02:38.910
All right.
I'm gonna search up near the road.

02:38.930 --> 02:40.826
Maybe Castle managed to bail
out before the car crashed.

02:40.846 --> 02:42.688
All right, we'll start on the car,
see if we can tell what happened

02:42.708 --> 02:44.949
- or where he went.
- All right.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.803
Taggert: Airbag went off.

02:47.823 --> 02:49.576
It only activates when
someone's in that seat,

02:49.596 --> 02:51.655
so your man was definitely at the wheel.

02:51.675 --> 02:54.047
Yeah, but if he walked away,
where is he, and why isn't he picking up?

02:54.067 --> 02:56.707
Maybe his phone's damaged
or he's disoriented.

02:56.727 --> 02:58.153
I've seen it before.

02:58.173 --> 03:00.487
But if he left this vehicle,
there's gonna be tracks or a blood trail.

03:00.554 --> 03:01.855
[Cellphone rings, beeps]

03:01.923 --> 03:02.923
- Hello.
- Ryan: Hey, Javi.

03:02.990 --> 03:04.636
Walk to the back of Castle's car.

03:04.656 --> 03:06.138
- What for?
- Just do it, okay?

03:06.158 --> 03:09.148
Check the passenger rear side.
Tell me what you see.

03:12.268 --> 03:13.799
Looks like it took a hit on the right side,

03:13.819 --> 03:15.338
- busted a taillight.
- That's 'cause Castle

03:15.358 --> 03:16.963
got bumped by another
car and run off the road.

03:16.983 --> 03:18.266
I got debris up here.

03:18.286 --> 03:19.358
All right, call local CSU.

03:19.378 --> 03:21.753
Maybe those pieces can
help us I.D. That car.

03:21.773 --> 03:24.479
Detective, I think I got something.

03:28.081 --> 03:29.114
Tracks.

03:29.182 --> 03:31.292
Going from the car up to the road.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.991
Water washed part of the trail,
but it looks like three people.

03:34.140 --> 03:37.259
- Three people? That can't be right.
- See the two troughs in the dirt?

03:37.279 --> 03:39.530
Made by heels from a pair of shoes.

03:39.550 --> 03:42.591
So he was run off the road
then dragged from the car.

03:42.963 --> 03:44.769
Castle got grabbed.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.420
- What?
- I had Taggert set up roadblocks

03:50.440 --> 03:52.554
to stop and search every vehicle.

03:52.574 --> 03:54.547
We figured that the car that
ran Castle into the ditch

03:54.567 --> 03:55.937
may be the same car he's in now.

03:55.957 --> 03:58.257
- Okay, we get a description?
- Not yet, but CSU thinks

03:58.277 --> 04:00.645
the side-marker glass
up ahead came from a GM.

04:00.713 --> 04:01.963
Local P.D. is canvassing

04:01.983 --> 04:03.750
to see if anyone saw any
vehicles leaving the area.

04:03.770 --> 04:05.961
- What about Castle's cellphone?
- His provider says it's shut off.

04:05.981 --> 04:08.519
Contacted the FBI to see if it
could be turned on remotely.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.697
It's a long shot, but you never know.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.997
- What else?
- Kate...

04:11.017 --> 04:12.623
Everything that can be done is being done.

04:12.691 --> 04:14.425
Espo, don't tell me that.

04:14.493 --> 04:17.123
They took him. I need to do something.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.903
Then tell us about that phone call you got.
Was he nervous?

04:19.923 --> 04:22.367
Did he indicate in any
way he was being followed?

04:22.633 --> 04:23.792
No, he was just...

04:23.812 --> 04:25.069
[Cellphone chimes]

04:25.882 --> 04:27.939
...normal.
He was normal.

04:28.007 --> 04:30.108
Hey, Sergeant Taggert may have a witness.

04:30.128 --> 04:32.183
Guy runs a fruit stand up the road.

04:33.077 --> 04:35.146
Yeah, I definitely saw a Mercedes go by

04:35.166 --> 04:38.020
around the time you're talking...
bronze-colored.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.428
- Esposito: That's Castle's car.
- What about any cars after that?

04:40.448 --> 04:41.052
Uh, let's see.

04:41.072 --> 04:45.121
There was a Volkswagen bug,
a Ferrari, an SUV.

04:45.141 --> 04:46.858
No one's gonna run him
off the road with a bug

04:46.878 --> 04:48.894
- or a Ferrari.
- Talk to me about that SUV.

04:48.914 --> 04:49.886
It was an Escalade...

04:49.906 --> 04:51.984
black with tinted windows
and chrome wheels.

04:52.004 --> 04:53.612
How is it you happen to
remember it so clearly?

04:53.632 --> 04:55.933
Because I saw it twice.
He passed heading north.

04:56.001 --> 04:58.791
Then he blew by again
maybe 10 minutes later.

04:59.002 --> 05:02.035
They were headed south off
of Long Island with Castle.

05:02.055 --> 05:03.647
I'll put out an apb on the Escalade.

05:03.667 --> 05:05.248
I'm gonna call state police,
have them set up checkpoints

05:05.268 --> 05:06.700
at every road leading off of Long Island.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.346
Getting Castle off the
island may not be the plan.

05:08.413 --> 05:09.647
The feds just called.

05:09.715 --> 05:11.443
They were able to remotely
activate Castle's phone

05:11.463 --> 05:13.094
- for a few seconds.
- Did they get a location?

05:13.114 --> 05:16.258
Yeah, he's still on the island.
According to his GPS, as of 10 minutes ago,

05:16.278 --> 05:18.934
- he was in medford.
- How far is Medford from here?

05:18.954 --> 05:20.572
Not far the way I'm gonna drive.

05:20.592 --> 05:22.760
[Tires screech]

05:24.446 --> 05:25.846
It says Castle's GPS

05:25.914 --> 05:28.082
puts him at a hundred
feet into this junkyard.

05:28.149 --> 05:29.750
State police are 10 minutes out.

05:29.818 --> 05:31.409
They want you to wait for backup.

05:31.429 --> 05:33.134
Not a chance in hell.

05:34.722 --> 05:36.360
It's right over there.

05:36.380 --> 05:38.492
85 feet and closing.

05:39.894 --> 05:40.900
Which way?

05:40.920 --> 05:42.997
Other side of this car carrier, I think.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.318
60 feet now.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.602
Beckett: There.
Black Escalade.

05:48.670 --> 05:50.788
Yeah.
That's ground zero for Castle's GPS.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.475
So he's in there.

05:52.495 --> 05:54.159
[Metal whirring]

05:59.433 --> 06:00.699
No.

06:02.287 --> 06:04.495
Stop!
Do not move!

06:06.145 --> 06:07.361
Stop!

06:26.250 --> 06:29.747
On the ground! Freeze! Don't move!
On the ground now!

06:30.845 --> 06:33.213
Aah! [Both grunt]

06:35.483 --> 06:37.077
What have you done?!
What have you done?!

06:37.097 --> 06:39.020
Beckett! We got him! We got him!

06:39.040 --> 06:41.097
- No!
- Beckett, stop!

No! No!

06:52.667 --> 06:54.172

06:54.192 --> 06:56.203
You're no stranger to rooms like this.

06:56.902 --> 06:58.605
But this time it's different.

06:58.673 --> 07:02.309
This time,
your only option is to give me answers.

07:02.528 --> 07:04.129
And what if I don't?

07:07.864 --> 07:11.302
You were in the junkyard
when that SUV came in.

07:11.624 --> 07:13.830
- Who was in it?
- You know what?

07:13.979 --> 07:15.349
I want a lawyer.

07:15.369 --> 07:17.857
[Chain rattles] Aah!
[Cracking] Aah!

07:18.484 --> 07:20.549
You're a low-level dirtbag, Gary.

07:20.569 --> 07:21.962
You're not a criminal mastermind,

07:22.029 --> 07:23.129
so start talking.

07:23.197 --> 07:25.065
- Aah!
- Who was in the car?

07:25.132 --> 07:27.053
Who had you crush it?

07:29.075 --> 07:30.537
Was Castle in the car?

07:30.557 --> 07:32.172
Was he in the car?

07:32.240 --> 07:33.885
Was he alive?

07:34.021 --> 07:36.076
Aah! You're gonna break my finger!

07:36.143 --> 07:37.744
And then after that, there's nine more,

07:37.812 --> 07:39.145
so tell me what I want to know.

07:39.213 --> 07:39.980
[Groans]

07:40.047 --> 07:41.448
Start talking.

07:41.515 --> 07:43.116
[Grunts]

07:43.543 --> 07:45.603
I got nothing to say.

07:46.124 --> 07:47.921
[Knock on door]

07:50.925 --> 07:52.826
What? What is it?

07:53.632 --> 07:55.161
Forensics came back on the SUV.

07:55.229 --> 07:58.064
There was no blood or tissue.
Castle wasn't inside.

07:59.732 --> 08:00.834
[Sighs]

08:01.692 --> 08:02.836
Okay.

08:03.554 --> 08:04.738
So he's still out there.

08:08.581 --> 08:10.810
Which means they crushed the
car to cover their tracks.

08:10.878 --> 08:13.959
Okay, get CSU to sweep for DNA and prints.

08:13.979 --> 08:16.495
And let's move Gary Duffin
to a holding cell.

08:16.515 --> 08:18.351
So you can do what to him?

08:18.997 --> 08:20.337
I was watching.

08:20.357 --> 08:22.756
Getting booted off the force
is not gonna help anything.

08:22.823 --> 08:24.891
Espo, he knows who took Castle.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.954
Well, he's never gonna give them up.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.213
Whoever they are, he's way more
afraid of them than he is of you.

08:32.844 --> 08:34.801
Fine. We'll try another angle...

08:34.869 --> 08:36.230
For now.

08:36.491 --> 08:38.054
Thanks.

08:38.639 --> 08:41.219
So, we are dead-ended on the SUV.

08:41.239 --> 08:43.618
Ran the vin number.
Turns out that it was stolen

08:43.638 --> 08:45.245
from a long-term parking lot near JFK

08:45.265 --> 08:47.701
with conveniently lousy video surveillance.

08:47.986 --> 08:51.426
[Sighs] Okay, let's dig deeper
into our car-crusher, Gary Duffin...

08:51.446 --> 08:54.254
look into his background,
his known associates.

08:54.322 --> 08:56.060
That might lead us
to whoever took Castle.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.132
- We're on it.
- Detective.

08:58.152 --> 08:59.774
Do you have a moment?

08:59.794 --> 09:01.171
Yes, sir.

09:01.729 --> 09:03.229
How are you holding up?

09:04.112 --> 09:05.231
I'm fine.

09:05.490 --> 09:08.138
I truly can't imagine
what you're going through,

09:08.158 --> 09:10.174
how you can focus at a time like this.

09:10.194 --> 09:13.153
Uh, sir,
please don't take me off of this case.

09:13.173 --> 09:15.652
Oh, I won't... unless you give me cause to.

09:15.672 --> 09:17.544
You keep doing what you're doing.

09:17.611 --> 09:19.097
Okay. Thank you.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.203
And you should know
we're using every resource

09:21.223 --> 09:22.782
that we have to find Mr. Castle,

09:22.850 --> 09:24.653
including calling in the FBI.

09:24.673 --> 09:27.020
There's a Special Agent Connors
waiting to speak with you.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.389
Sir, with all due respect,
I-I'm under the gun here.

09:29.457 --> 09:32.133
I don't have time to
bring the FBI up to speed.

09:32.153 --> 09:34.594
I'm already up to speed, detective.

09:34.662 --> 09:36.796
I just have a few questions.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.710
Kate.

09:39.859 --> 09:41.267
They can help.

09:46.106 --> 09:47.941
I understand investigating this case

09:48.008 --> 09:50.377
puts you in a terribly difficult position.

09:50.685 --> 09:51.578
Yeah.

09:51.645 --> 09:54.759
But I need to talk to you about Mr. Castle.

09:54.779 --> 09:57.501
Outside of his family,
you're the one who knew him best.

09:57.521 --> 10:00.220
Yeah, well,
he didn't have any problems with...

10:00.287 --> 10:02.544
gambling, money, drugs,

10:02.564 --> 10:05.357
affairs, so we can skip all of that.

10:06.498 --> 10:09.717
I understand he was headed to the Hamptons
when he was abducted.

10:09.737 --> 10:11.330
Yeah.
For our wedding.

10:11.350 --> 10:13.029
Who knew he was making that drive?

10:13.049 --> 10:14.997
The wedding guests, um...

10:15.547 --> 10:17.347
Catering staff.

10:17.415 --> 10:19.812
- I'll need their names.
- I've got a list.

10:19.832 --> 10:21.919
But they're all friends and family.

10:21.986 --> 10:23.687
Still...

10:23.755 --> 10:26.741
Agent Connors, do you think
that this could be a ransom kidnapping?

10:26.761 --> 10:28.143
If it is, we'll be ready.

10:28.163 --> 10:30.178
It's standard protocol to
set up a trap-and-trace

10:30.198 --> 10:32.262
in Mr. Castle's loft...

10:32.400 --> 10:34.398
In the event kidnappers call.

10:34.466 --> 10:37.380
We'll also monitor family cellphones.

10:37.753 --> 10:41.041
You sound like you don't
expect those phones to ring.

10:43.746 --> 10:46.251
Agent Connors,
do you know something that I don't?

10:46.524 --> 10:48.365
I just keep coming back to how much easier

10:48.385 --> 10:50.339
it would've been to
grab Castle in the city.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.510
Instead, they took him on Long Island,

10:52.530 --> 10:55.065
just as he was about to get married...

10:55.085 --> 10:56.749
to you.

10:57.432 --> 11:00.556
Do you think that this has
something to do with me?

11:00.993 --> 11:03.493
You and Mr. Castle worked
a lot of cases together.

11:03.560 --> 11:06.963
Could someone you went
after have taken revenge?

11:09.066 --> 11:10.832
Yeah. A lot of people.

11:11.403 --> 11:14.337
Okay, well,
I'll start by taking a run at Gary Duffin.

11:14.357 --> 11:15.571
You go through your case files,

11:15.639 --> 11:18.093
come up with a list of potential suspects.

11:18.113 --> 11:19.991
Keep me apprised of what you find.

11:20.011 --> 11:22.568
As long as you do the same.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.919
He'll come back.

11:30.477 --> 11:32.704
Of course he will, darling.

11:32.724 --> 11:36.024
Your father will be
home before you know it.

11:54.074 --> 11:56.746
- Thanks.
- We'll find him.

11:57.648 --> 12:00.323
So, was Agent Connors able to
get anything out of Duffin?

12:00.343 --> 12:03.450
Not a word, so he went back to FBI HQ.

12:03.470 --> 12:05.634
Are those the perps you think
might've made a move on Castle?

12:05.654 --> 12:08.401
Yeah. Starting with Senator Bracken.

12:08.421 --> 12:09.692
Oh, you think Bracken's behind this?

12:09.760 --> 12:12.256
Well, we've ruined his life
and had him sent to prison.

12:12.276 --> 12:16.061
Taking Castle down on his way to our
wedding would be just like him.

12:16.371 --> 12:20.347
Or like 3XK, for that matter,
or Mickey Barbosa or any of the other

12:20.367 --> 12:23.492
dozens of people we've had put away
over the past few years.

12:23.512 --> 12:25.386
I mean, it could be any of them.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.709
- Or none of them.
- Hey.

12:28.228 --> 12:30.449
We're gonna figure this out, okay?

12:31.404 --> 12:34.495
Kate,
don't get lost in worst-case scenarios.

12:34.515 --> 12:37.163
When Alexis was taken,
tied back to Castle's dad.

12:37.183 --> 12:39.980
Maybe he's mixed up in this, and if he is,
he's gonna look out for his son.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.403
Except this is shaping up
to be more mob-related.

12:43.423 --> 12:45.935
- What makes you say that?
- I ran Gary Duffin's cell records.

12:45.955 --> 12:49.794
Right before he crushed that SUV,
he got a call from a Jersey mobster.

12:49.814 --> 12:51.457
That must be the guy who ordered Gary

12:51.477 --> 12:54.246
to squash that car,
and why he's so scared to talk.

12:54.266 --> 12:57.401
- Who is this mobster?
- One Vincent Cardano.

12:57.421 --> 12:59.752
Vinnie Cardano?
I-I met him.

12:59.772 --> 13:01.822
Castle knows him.

13:01.842 --> 13:03.292
Was there ever a problem between them?

13:03.312 --> 13:05.826
Yeah. There was.

13:06.099 --> 13:08.022
No, there wasn't. Trust me.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.174
Things are simpatico with me and Castle.

13:10.194 --> 13:13.168
Fact is,
it pains my soul that Rick is missing.

13:13.188 --> 13:14.434
What can I do to help?

13:14.454 --> 13:17.077
I was there the night that
you got angry with him and stormed out.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.693
He near accused me of murder.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.194
He impugned my integrity.

13:20.262 --> 13:24.083
But we made our peace ages ago
over a nice bottle of Valpolicella.

13:24.103 --> 13:27.453
Then why did you call
Gary Duffin earlier today?

13:27.826 --> 13:31.263
Was it to tell him to
destroy a certain SUV?

13:31.449 --> 13:33.625
What's an SUV got to do with this?

13:33.645 --> 13:36.548
It was involved in Castle's abduction.

13:36.797 --> 13:41.041
- This I did not know.
- But you did have Gary crush that car.

13:41.401 --> 13:43.971
We're entering into a gray area here.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.024
Uh, you're an accessory to kidnapping.
There's nothing gray about that.

13:47.044 --> 13:50.002
I'm telling you, Kate,
I did not have Rick grabbed.

13:50.022 --> 13:51.739
Then stop playing games and tell me...

13:51.759 --> 13:55.053
why did you have the car crushed?

13:55.959 --> 13:59.421
Vinnie,
you said that you wanted to help him.

14:00.265 --> 14:02.176
This is your chance.

14:03.790 --> 14:05.720
Okay, listen.

14:05.740 --> 14:09.145
On occasion, clients might need
to make a vehicle disappear,

14:09.165 --> 14:12.608
and for 10 grand,
such a thing can be handled.

14:12.628 --> 14:15.449
- What was the name of the client?
- No names came up.

14:15.469 --> 14:17.798
He called me in the morning.
He said the right things.

14:17.818 --> 14:19.325
We struck a deal.

14:19.345 --> 14:21.608
But I never met the man.
It was all anonymous.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.177
- Then how did you get paid?
- We used a drop.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.573
A client left a bag full
of cash in a dumpster

14:26.593 --> 14:31.096
in the lower east side right after the SUV
got turned into a panini.

14:31.116 --> 14:32.015
After?

14:32.035 --> 14:33.166
What happens if you crush a car

14:33.233 --> 14:35.708
and then you don't get your money?
[Chuckles]

14:36.663 --> 14:38.550
That does not happen.

14:39.173 --> 14:40.707
Where exactly is this dumpster?

14:40.774 --> 14:42.241
Ellis: Based on what Cardano said,

14:42.309 --> 14:44.196
this is the drop point.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.777
Now, what are we looking at here?
This is not street-cam footage.

14:46.797 --> 14:49.693
There's no coverage in the area,
but after a rash of break-ins,

14:49.713 --> 14:51.569
one of the buildings
installed hidden cameras,

14:51.589 --> 14:53.494
and I was able to tap in.

14:53.514 --> 14:56.509
This is in the time window
when the drop should've taken place.

14:56.529 --> 15:00.342
If we get eyes on Cardano's client,
we can get a real lead on who took Castle.

15:03.593 --> 15:05.529
There. Go back.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.560
That's him.
That's the client, dropping off the cash.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.918
I'll set up a canvass. Someone had to see
where this guy came from or where he went.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.075
Yeah, this is Esposito.
Connect me with operations.

15:17.095 --> 15:18.986
Wait. Freeze that.

15:19.006 --> 15:20.880
Zoom in.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.153
Can't be.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.019
It is. That's Castle.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.432
He's the one who dropped off the cash?

15:41.283 --> 15:43.717
Do you want me to run it again?

15:44.102 --> 15:46.025
I need to get some air.

15:46.398 --> 15:48.289
[Door opens]

15:48.743 --> 15:49.828
[Door closes]

15:49.848 --> 15:51.746
Yeah, Tory, one more time, please.

15:51.970 --> 15:53.906
What are you gonna see
that you didn't see before?

15:53.926 --> 15:55.796
- Maybe we missed something.
- Yeah, we missed something.

15:55.864 --> 15:58.903
Castle's in on this.
He planned the whole thing.

16:13.388 --> 16:15.059
Maybe it isn't really him.

16:15.915 --> 16:16.933
Just think about it.

16:16.953 --> 16:18.784
3XK, he used a look-alike

16:18.851 --> 16:21.239
to try to frame him for murder...
a guy with Castle's face.

16:21.259 --> 16:25.058
No. No, Kevin, it wasn't just his face.

16:26.274 --> 16:31.125
It was his clothes.
It was his movements, his body.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.725
It was him, on his own

16:35.745 --> 16:38.904
[sniffles] Just hours after
he was supposedly abducted.

16:39.101 --> 16:41.111
Beckett, this doesn't make any sense.

16:41.131 --> 16:43.742
He wouldn't do that, not Castle.

16:43.810 --> 16:46.044
[Sighs] Look into Castle, okay?

16:46.718 --> 16:48.213
Find out what he did, who he...

16:48.281 --> 16:51.149
who he talked to just
before he went missing, and, um...

16:52.004 --> 16:53.318
brief Agent Connors.

16:53.386 --> 16:55.764
What are you now?

16:57.139 --> 16:58.890
I'm gonna talk to his family.

17:07.702 --> 17:10.167
Ellis: And these images were taken
after the accident

17:10.236 --> 17:12.108
- the car fire?
- Yes.

17:12.127 --> 17:15.859
Martha: So he's alive. He's not being
held captive by God knows who.

17:15.880 --> 17:19.006
Wait. Are you saying dad was
run off the road by an SUV

17:19.026 --> 17:21.190
and after that, he pai crushed?

17:21.210 --> 17:23.536
- It looks that way, yeah.
- Well, that's ridiculous.

17:23.556 --> 17:25.913
Why on earth would he do such a thing?

17:27.738 --> 17:30.504
Was he going through anything
that I didn't know about?

17:30.524 --> 17:32.390
Like what?

17:32.410 --> 17:35.095
Pressure that he was under
that he kept to himself.

17:35.115 --> 17:36.794
Of course not.
Right, gram?

17:36.814 --> 17:39.285
No, no, no, no. I would've noticed.

17:41.215 --> 17:43.826
And what about the wedding?

17:43.846 --> 17:46.018
Did he have any misgivings?

17:48.314 --> 17:49.791
Misgivings?

17:49.811 --> 17:51.801
Katherine.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.214
That was the farthest thing from his mind.

17:54.234 --> 17:57.046
He couldn't wait to be married to you.

17:57.354 --> 18:01.250
You don't think he'd just walk away,
do you?

18:04.986 --> 18:06.202
No.

18:06.203 --> 18:08.349
Then what's going on here?

18:08.622 --> 18:10.225
I don't know.

18:10.570 --> 18:13.027
But there's got to be another explanation.

18:13.047 --> 18:14.729
I don't think there is.

18:14.749 --> 18:17.124
The video clearly shows
Castle out in the world,

18:17.144 --> 18:18.352
not under duress.

18:18.372 --> 18:20.313
It changes the dynamics of the case.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.805
No, this is still a kidnapping.

18:22.872 --> 18:24.394
That video could be a fake.

18:24.414 --> 18:28.141
All it shows is Castle throwing away a bag.

18:28.245 --> 18:30.312
- That could've been shot a month ago.
- It wasn't.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.214
Our tech team analyzed the footage.

18:32.282 --> 18:33.788
It's authentic.

18:35.152 --> 18:36.352
Were you aware

18:36.420 --> 18:38.354
he withdrew a large sum
just before he disappeared?

18:38.422 --> 18:40.122
Yes. It was for our honeymoon.

18:40.190 --> 18:41.424
Vinnie Cardano

18:41.491 --> 18:45.094
turned over the $10,000 that
was left in the dumpster.

18:45.377 --> 18:48.064
It's the same money that Castle withdrew.

18:50.599 --> 18:51.606
That's not possible.

18:51.626 --> 18:53.736
That's because you're locked into
your own version of events,

18:53.756 --> 18:56.693
but, detective, I can show you those bills,

18:57.115 --> 18:59.262
the matching serial numbers.

19:08.176 --> 19:10.274
There's something else going on.

19:10.658 --> 19:12.656
There has to be.

19:13.128 --> 19:14.952
It all lines up,

19:15.200 --> 19:17.303
right down to the fact
that Castle knew Cardano,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.542
knew he could make cars vanish.

19:19.562 --> 19:20.728
So...what?

19:20.748 --> 19:23.942
He went through this charade
just to stage his own disappearance?

19:23.962 --> 19:25.687
Why?

19:30.031 --> 19:31.947
People are complex.

19:31.967 --> 19:36.112
Maybe he had a breakdown
or a personal crisis.

19:36.534 --> 19:40.632
And maybe there's a secret side to the man
that nobody knows.

19:40.893 --> 19:42.965
Including you.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.998
Loo, Agent Connors...

19:48.140 --> 19:51.072
I know that there are a lot
of unanswered questions here,

19:51.092 --> 19:53.896
but you cannot stop looking for him.

19:54.628 --> 19:57.165
We'll follow every lead to the end.

19:57.185 --> 19:59.076
But once those leads dry up,

19:59.096 --> 20:02.037
we have to scale back our investigation.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.915
I will find Castle.

20:06.052 --> 20:08.782
With or without the FBI.

20:09.774 --> 20:12.731
You're assuming he wants to be found.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.610
My name is Detective Kate Beckett.

20:17.630 --> 20:19.558
I'm calling from the
New York Homicide Division...

20:19.578 --> 20:22.120
Calling to see if there
was any recent activity.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.956
...to see if you had a
gentleman named Richard Castle

20:23.990 --> 20:25.791
check into your hotel over the
last 48 hours. Richard Castle.

20:25.826 --> 20:28.904
He's about 6'2".
Take at local airlines, gas stations...

20:28.924 --> 20:31.650
And pull traffic cameras. Traffic footage.
Traffic cams in the Hamptons.

20:31.670 --> 20:33.363
Past 48 hours. Anything you can get me.

20:33.383 --> 20:34.467
For the Hamptons?

20:34.487 --> 20:36.391
Man:...Castle's mysterious disappearance.

20:36.411 --> 20:40.188
FBI agents left the NYPD's 12th precinct.

20:49.685 --> 20:51.881
Hey, Mark,
can you put me in to the French consulate?

20:51.901 --> 20:53.569
Calling from the United States, yes.

20:53.589 --> 20:55.654
I need to speak with the...
Uh, je suis un détective.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.211
In regards to a Richard Castle.
Okay, anything coming out of the Hamptons?

20:58.231 --> 21:00.767
For the past two weeks, yeah.
Okay, I'll look for it in my e-mail.

21:00.787 --> 21:02.959
No, I need it right away.

21:22.807 --> 21:25.741
Man: This is the United States Coast Guard.

21:25.761 --> 21:29.416
Please respond if you are in distress
or need assistance.

21:43.709 --> 21:45.645
He was found adrift 80 miles
off the coast of Delaware

21:45.665 --> 21:48.507
by a coast guard cutter that was
out there mapping the currents.

21:48.631 --> 21:50.695
Captain recognized who he was
and had him airlifted here.

21:50.715 --> 21:52.749
What was he doing in the
middle of the Atlantic ocean?

21:52.769 --> 21:55.185
Yeah, especially in a dinghy
with three bullet holes in it.

21:55.219 --> 21:57.320
- He was shot?
- The captain said no, but the doctors here

21:57.355 --> 21:58.988
won't give us any updates on his condition.

21:59.023 --> 22:00.753
Where are Martha and Alexis?

22:00.773 --> 22:03.205
- In a patrol car on their way in now.
- Okay.

22:12.670 --> 22:14.542
Kate?

22:16.466 --> 22:18.067
I'm fine.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.210
I just never thought I'd see him again.

22:44.943 --> 22:46.367
Castle.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.368
Hey.

22:51.272 --> 22:52.900
It's me.

23:00.718 --> 23:02.550
Dad?!

23:02.791 --> 23:04.352
Richard, darling.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.583
What's wrong with him?

23:09.849 --> 23:12.355
Mr. Castle hasn't sustained
any serious injuries,

23:12.375 --> 23:15.666
and his vital signs continue to improve,
but he is recovering

23:15.686 --> 23:18.809
from the effects of
exposure and dehydration.

23:18.829 --> 23:20.473
Why hasn't he regained consciousness?

23:20.493 --> 23:22.223
We're running some
additional tests to find out,

23:22.243 --> 23:24.919
but at this point,
we don't think there's any cause for alarm.

23:24.939 --> 23:26.472
Martha: But we'd like to stay with him,

23:26.507 --> 23:28.008
keep him company, if that's all right.

23:28.042 --> 23:29.009
- Of course.
- Thank you.

23:29.043 --> 23:30.557
Lanie: Kate!

23:32.112 --> 23:33.813
How is he?

23:33.848 --> 23:36.149
He's stable, but he's still unconscious.

23:36.183 --> 23:37.537
So we still don't know
what happened to him?

23:37.661 --> 23:38.691
No.

23:38.915 --> 23:41.228
Well, if there's anything I can do...

23:41.248 --> 23:43.819
Actually, yeah,
I need you to take a look at him.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.958
You do know living patients
aren't my thing, right?

23:45.992 --> 23:48.627
No, Lanie, look,
I don't want you to treat him.

23:48.662 --> 23:51.526
I want you to look at
him as if it was a case.

23:51.546 --> 23:52.965
See if you can find any evidence

23:52.999 --> 23:55.395
of where he's been
and what he's been through.

23:55.415 --> 23:56.969
I'll see what I can do. Okay.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.604
All right.

24:01.533 --> 24:04.818
I'm with Beckett...
I never thought we'd see Castle again.

24:05.203 --> 24:06.535
Still...

24:06.555 --> 24:07.660
Where's he been?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.013
You saw those bullet holes.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.950
Maybe he used the boat to escape
from whoever abducted him.

24:11.984 --> 24:15.247
The guy faked his own
kidnapping and then ran off.

24:15.267 --> 24:16.888
Now, how could he do that to Beckett?

24:16.922 --> 24:19.390
As long as we've known him,
worked with him,

24:19.424 --> 24:23.073
don't you think Castle deserves
the benefit of the doubt?

24:28.246 --> 24:31.311
You guys,
none of us knows the truth about Castle.

24:31.758 --> 24:33.337
Not yet.

24:33.371 --> 24:36.207
And, espo, you know what?
If you're wrong, then he was a victim.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.481
So instead of us just standing around

24:37.501 --> 24:39.578
waiting for him to wake up,
why don't we start

24:39.598 --> 24:41.588
by figuring out who owns that dinghy?

24:41.646 --> 24:42.880
Already on it.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.181
The boat had expired tags

24:44.216 --> 24:46.284
registered to a Curtis holt of Savannah,
Georgia.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.318
We called holt.

24:47.352 --> 24:49.639
He said that he sold it
over a year ago at a garage sale.

24:49.659 --> 24:51.091
He can't recall who he sold it to.

24:51.111 --> 24:53.449
Okay. Check his story.
Find the current owner.

24:53.469 --> 24:56.322
We find the owner, we'll figure out
where Castle was coming from.

24:56.342 --> 24:58.134
In the meantime,
I'll talk to the ship's captain

24:58.154 --> 25:00.564
and see if he can tell us anything else.

25:00.598 --> 25:04.606
Based on Mr. Castle's condition,
I'm guessing he'd been

25:04.626 --> 25:06.393
in that vessel four or five days.

25:06.413 --> 25:08.776
Okay, could the dinghy have
come from a larger boat?

25:08.796 --> 25:09.731
Not likely.

25:09.751 --> 25:12.503
See, it has fenders, or pads,
to protect the paint,

25:12.523 --> 25:15.490
and the position of the fenders
points to it being moored at a dock.

25:15.510 --> 25:17.614
Is there any way to
know where that dock is?

25:17.649 --> 25:19.115
I could give you my best guess.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.717
The dinghy had a six-horse motor,

25:20.751 --> 25:22.886
two hours worth of fuel
if the tanks were full.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.889
After it ran dry, it drifted for...

25:25.923 --> 25:27.123
four or five days.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.592
So based on wind and current vectors,

25:29.626 --> 25:32.295
it probably launched
somewhere between Rhode Island

25:32.330 --> 25:33.849
and Southern Maine.

25:33.869 --> 25:36.472
Esposito: Looks like we caught a break.
Turns out that sky-blue dinghy

25:36.492 --> 25:38.735
was a standard white when
it came out of the factory.

25:38.769 --> 25:39.869
And how does that help us?

25:39.903 --> 25:41.437
Well, the previous owner pimped it out.

25:41.472 --> 25:44.940
He added custom fishing-rod holders
and painted it sky-blue.

25:44.975 --> 25:47.243
Making it a relative rarity
in the world of dinghies.

25:47.277 --> 25:49.044
So, going off what the captain told you,

25:49.079 --> 25:51.546
we put out a bolo on all sky-blue dinghies

25:51.566 --> 25:54.267
to all law enforcement along the coast
from Rhode Island to Maine.

25:54.287 --> 25:56.285
We got a hit. Park ranger
in Gloucester, Massachusetts,

25:56.319 --> 25:58.300
recalls seeing it at a private dock.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.423
This is a satellite photo off
the web taken a month ago.

26:01.457 --> 26:03.792
This is the private dock the
ranger was talking about.

26:03.826 --> 26:04.826
And there's the sky-blue dinghy.

26:04.861 --> 26:07.029
Complete with custom fishing-rod holders.

26:07.063 --> 26:09.098
Just like the one Castle was found in.

26:09.887 --> 26:11.617
Okay, so...

26:11.637 --> 26:12.967
This looks like a mobile home.

26:13.002 --> 26:14.544
Does the dock belong to it?

26:14.564 --> 26:18.507
It's all part of the same property
owned by one Henry Jenkins.

26:18.862 --> 26:21.543
Whatever's going on with Castle,
this is where he came from.

26:21.577 --> 26:24.048
And this guy must be involved.

26:29.186 --> 26:30.940
Beckett: Thanks for holding down the fort,
Sergeant Simms.

26:30.960 --> 26:32.950
All I did was hang around
and watch a mobile home.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.237
What's this all about?

26:34.257 --> 26:36.428
It's about the owner, Henry Jenkins.
Do you know him?

26:36.448 --> 26:37.892
No. We don't get over here too much.

26:37.912 --> 26:39.778
Whoever he is, he's not home.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.277
I didn't notice any signs of life.

26:41.297 --> 26:42.997
Okay, well, we'll take it over from here.

26:43.031 --> 26:44.566
I'm a radio call away if you need me.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.184
Thank you.

26:49.733 --> 26:52.439
Looks like Henry Jenkins
scrubbed himself off the web.

26:52.474 --> 26:54.809
All Tory can find out
is what we already know.

26:54.843 --> 26:56.811
He runs a private security firm in Boston.

26:56.845 --> 26:59.013
And we still don't know
what kind of security.

26:59.047 --> 27:01.315
Are we talking mall cops
or military contractor?

27:01.961 --> 27:04.351
Either way,
that would give him access to firearms,

27:04.386 --> 27:06.378
which could explain the bullet holes
in the boat. [ Cellphone vibrates ]

27:06.398 --> 27:08.355
But what's the link between him and Castle?

27:08.390 --> 27:09.990
Why would he be mixed up with this guy?

27:10.024 --> 27:13.327
It's Lanie. She may have something.
Stand by.

27:13.361 --> 27:15.362
Lanie: Kate, I talked Castle's doctor

27:15.397 --> 27:17.063
into letting me look him over,

27:17.098 --> 27:20.534
and I came across a few... strange things.

27:20.568 --> 27:21.568
Strange how?

27:21.603 --> 27:23.737
No trace evidence on Castle's clothes.

27:23.772 --> 27:28.608
But I did find a key sewn
into the lining of his pants.

27:28.642 --> 27:30.110
What kind of a key?

27:30.144 --> 27:31.211
I'm not sure,

27:31.245 --> 27:33.446
but it has "38" stamped on it.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.448
- That mean anything to you?
- No.

27:35.482 --> 27:36.883
Okay.

27:36.918 --> 27:38.751
Then there's his blood work.

27:38.786 --> 27:41.887
I found antibodies to dengue fever.

27:41.922 --> 27:43.690
That means Castle was exposed to the virus

27:43.724 --> 27:45.495
within the last two months.

27:45.515 --> 27:47.493
Wait. Isn't dengue fever tropical?

27:47.528 --> 27:48.561
Yeah!

27:48.595 --> 27:52.962
It's mostly found in Latin America,
Africa, and Asia.

27:52.982 --> 27:54.367
That doesn't make any sense.

27:54.401 --> 27:56.369
Neither does the bullet wound I found.

27:56.403 --> 27:58.204
Castle was grazed across the ribs.

27:58.238 --> 27:59.638
Okay, that makes a little bit more sense.

27:59.672 --> 28:00.906
There were bullet holes on the boat.

28:00.941 --> 28:03.008
But this wound was mainly healed.

28:03.043 --> 28:05.044
He was shot a few weeks ago.

28:05.078 --> 28:06.478
A few weeks ago?

28:06.512 --> 28:07.546
Are you sure?

28:07.580 --> 28:09.464
Maybe even longer.

28:09.886 --> 28:13.249
Kate, what the hell was Castle mixed up in?

28:14.654 --> 28:15.887
Beckett.

28:15.921 --> 28:17.556
I just saw the curtain move.
Someone's in there.

28:17.590 --> 28:19.057
I'll call you back.

28:19.091 --> 28:20.573
Let's go.

28:22.918 --> 28:25.321
- Did you get eyes on anyone?
- Negative.

28:26.332 --> 28:28.237
- On the ground!
- Get down on the ground!

28:28.257 --> 28:30.735
Put your hands where
I can see 'em now, now, now!

28:30.769 --> 28:31.736
What's in the bags?

28:31.770 --> 28:32.871
Trash! Trash!

28:32.905 --> 28:34.906
I was taking out the trash!

28:37.376 --> 28:39.177
Beckett: Talk to me about Richard Castle.

28:39.211 --> 28:40.778
I'm telling you, I don't know the guy.

28:40.812 --> 28:41.946
I mean, I've never even heard of him.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.732
There's no sign that
anyone else has been here.

28:43.752 --> 28:45.416
'Cause no one comes here but me.

28:45.450 --> 28:47.814
This is my weekend place.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.587
This is your boat, correct?

28:49.621 --> 28:50.855
It would appear to be.

28:50.889 --> 28:52.390
If you don't know Mr. Castle,

28:52.424 --> 28:54.456
then how did he end up in this boat
in the middle of the ocean?

28:54.476 --> 28:56.427
I have no idea,

28:56.461 --> 28:58.829
but I did notice that it was missing

28:58.864 --> 29:00.297
when I came up here a few days ago.

29:00.331 --> 29:02.533
So your boat was missing,
but you didn't report that?

29:02.567 --> 29:03.733
I never use the damn thing.

29:03.768 --> 29:06.303
I mean, I don't...
I don't even know why I bought it.

29:06.337 --> 29:09.006
I just figured it came unmoored or...
or got stolen.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.308
Who would steal a dinghy?

29:12.238 --> 29:14.538
Well, there was a man who hanging around

29:14.558 --> 29:16.469
- down by the beach.
- A man?

29:17.102 --> 29:18.181
Describe him.

29:18.216 --> 29:22.519
Um, late 30s, I would guess, uh, tall,

29:22.553 --> 29:24.820
brown hair, big build.

29:27.439 --> 29:29.526
Yeah.
Yeah, th-that's definitely him.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.795
He was on the beach? What was he doing?

29:31.829 --> 29:33.241
Camping.

29:33.551 --> 29:34.776
Camping?

29:34.796 --> 29:36.565
That can't be right. In a tent.

29:36.599 --> 29:38.034
He was seemed to be
minding his own business,

29:38.068 --> 29:40.641
and it was on state land,
so I just left him alone.

29:42.850 --> 29:45.757
Ryan, can you finish taking Mr. Jenkins'
statement?

29:46.509 --> 29:48.661
Where exactly was this man?

29:56.767 --> 29:59.745
That's the dock
where the dinghy was tied up.

He could've walked up to that trailer
and made a phone call.

Richard will make a full recovery.

Oh. And I was right there

when Richard started to wake up.

31:22.502 --> 31:23.802
First thing he did

31:23.837 --> 31:25.529
was ask for you.

31:25.827 --> 31:27.751
Did he say where he had been?

You know,
we don't know what he's been through,

I was here.

other than his inability to
recall the last two months.

So is it possible that he underwent trauma,

33:13.490 --> 33:14.691
and he's blocking it out?

33:14.725 --> 33:17.660
He may have,
although I didn't see any evidence of that.

33:17.694 --> 33:19.161
Maybe his memory will come back

33:19.196 --> 33:20.829

33:20.863 --> 33:21.970
It very well might.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.850
What I do is not an exact science.
I wish it were.

33:41.884 --> 33:44.920
This could still be the
result of emotional trauma.

33:44.954 --> 33:46.254
There are also drugs

33:46.288 --> 33:48.723
and drug interactions
that can trigger memory loss,

33:48.757 --> 33:49.962
but...

33:49.982 --> 33:51.404
But what?

33:51.888 --> 33:53.568
...I can't exclude the possibility

33:53.588 --> 33:56.197
that Mr. Castle simply
walked away from his life,

33:56.232 --> 33:57.532
for whatever reason,

33:57.566 --> 34:00.091
and facing that fact
is just too humiliating for him.

34:00.111 --> 34:04.305
So you think that he could be
pretending not to remember?

34:04.340 --> 34:06.821
As I said, it's a possibility.

34:18.967 --> 34:21.909
To say I owe you an apology
seems an understatement.

34:21.929 --> 34:25.925
I don't want an apology, Castle.
I just want to understand.

34:26.092 --> 34:28.094
Well, you know me, Kate.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.297
I wouldn't just leave.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.303
There's evidence.

34:31.322 --> 34:33.467
We found the place where you were staying.

34:34.036 --> 34:35.837
- Where?
- What difference does it make?

34:35.857 --> 34:39.739
Because I want to go there.
Maybe it'll help me remember.

34:39.982 --> 34:42.942
Whatever happens, I need answers.

34:42.976 --> 34:44.993
And so do you.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.949
I don't get it.

34:49.984 --> 34:53.085
How could Castle
just leave and go...camping?

34:53.120 --> 34:54.889
What happened to giving him
the benefit of the doubt?

34:54.909 --> 34:58.357
Beckett asked me to have CSU take a look
at the contents of the tent.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.082
Javi, you were right.

35:01.615 --> 35:04.029
Castle's fingerprints
were all over the newspaper,

35:04.063 --> 35:07.366
all his stuff... hair, DNA.

35:08.683 --> 35:11.078
I can't explain that away.

35:12.021 --> 35:13.638
Not this time.

35:17.443 --> 35:20.078
Kind of reminds me
of the Hamptons or Maine,

35:20.113 --> 35:22.147
but I'm pretty sure I've never been here.

35:22.182 --> 35:23.282
Okay, this is it.

35:23.316 --> 35:25.250
This is where your tent was.

35:28.098 --> 35:30.791
No, none of this looks familiar.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.906
Castle, just tell me the truth.

35:35.228 --> 35:36.594
You owe me that much.

35:36.629 --> 35:39.631
I am telling you the truth. I was not here.

35:39.665 --> 35:41.533
Well, your clothes were here.

35:41.567 --> 35:43.702
Your watch was here, your tuxedo...

35:44.928 --> 35:48.378
The one that you were gonna
wear when you married me.

35:51.844 --> 35:54.678
It must've been planted here,
you know, along with...

35:54.713 --> 35:56.413
Nothing was planted, Castle. It was you.

35:56.448 --> 35:58.782
- It was your DNA, your prints.
- Must've been a mistake at the lab.

35:58.817 --> 36:01.885
- There have been numerous cases...
- I believed in you. I...

36:02.115 --> 36:04.522
I convinced myself
that the evidence didn't matter,

36:04.542 --> 36:08.625
that everything that seemed so obvious
couldn't possibly be true.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.060
I was searching for you.

36:10.094 --> 36:11.987
I didn't even know if you were
alive or if you were dead,

36:12.007 --> 36:14.571
and you were right here,
right where you wanted to be.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.367
I promise you...

36:17.232 --> 36:20.433
I did not pitch a tent here.
I could not have.

36:20.453 --> 36:22.739
I saw it for myself, Castle.

36:22.773 --> 36:24.752
I would never camp in this spot,

36:24.772 --> 36:27.377
not after the research I did on
"tropical storm."

36:27.411 --> 36:29.545
I can't even do this with you.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.638
Hey, wait. Listen.

36:30.658 --> 36:33.890
You never wrote a book called
"tropical storm," Castle.

36:33.910 --> 36:35.785
Kate, wait.

36:36.496 --> 36:37.820
Listen.

36:37.855 --> 36:40.623
I started the book. I threw it out.

36:40.657 --> 36:43.527
It was, uh...
super-villain controls the weather.

36:43.547 --> 36:45.895
It was terrible, but it...

36:46.145 --> 36:48.564
the research I did on
catastrophic storms...

36:48.599 --> 36:51.427
it stuck with me, leaving me with

36:51.848 --> 36:54.765
an irrational but
overpowering fear of tsunamis.

36:54.785 --> 36:57.197
You bought a beach house in the Hamptons.

36:57.217 --> 37:00.276
Yeah, on the inland side,
not on the ocean side.

37:00.737 --> 37:01.693
Kate...

37:01.713 --> 37:05.180
I would never camp here.
I would go for higher ground.

37:05.813 --> 37:07.228
Castle...

37:07.873 --> 37:09.584
There was a witness.

37:10.098 --> 37:11.887
What witness?

37:16.302 --> 37:18.460
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. NYPD.

37:18.494 --> 37:21.095
I'm here to see Henry Jenkins?

37:21.130 --> 37:22.798
I'm Henry Jenkins.

37:23.814 --> 37:25.633
I'm sorry.
I was here yesterday,

37:25.667 --> 37:27.635
and I met a different Henry Jenkins.

37:27.669 --> 37:30.315
What do you mean?
I'm Henry Jenkins,

37:30.335 --> 37:33.020
and I haven't been here in months.

37:35.589 --> 37:37.778
Beckett: We ran prints and passport.

37:37.813 --> 37:40.013
He is definitely the real Henry Jenkins.

37:40.048 --> 37:42.550
Which means the first
guy was a fake Jenkins...

37:42.584 --> 37:43.551
also, a liar.

37:43.585 --> 37:44.885
But he matched the DMV photo.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.821
That's because his photo got switched.

37:46.855 --> 37:48.656
When we called the DMV,
they realized their system

37:48.690 --> 37:49.857
had been hacked two days ago,

37:49.891 --> 37:51.995
right after the news
broke that I'd been found.

37:52.256 --> 37:53.794
What about all your stuff in the tent?

37:53.829 --> 37:54.962
Well, it looks like

37:54.996 --> 37:57.368
it was all set up in order
to create a false trail.

37:57.505 --> 37:58.765
So why don't you remember anything?

37:58.799 --> 38:01.201
Uh,
these people have managed to make it look

38:01.235 --> 38:03.236
as though I staged my own abduction.

38:03.271 --> 38:04.804
They hacked the DMV.

38:04.839 --> 38:06.806
They provided a false Jenkins

38:06.841 --> 38:09.809
who pointed you to doctored
evidence that I'd gone camping.

38:09.844 --> 38:12.979
Whoever they are,
they have unlimited resources,

38:13.013 --> 38:15.548
maybe the kind of resources
that would allow them

38:15.583 --> 38:17.399
to alter someone's memory.

38:17.820 --> 38:19.915
- What about the money?
- What money?

38:19.935 --> 38:25.057
We have you on video dropping off
$10,000 in a dumpster after you were taken.

38:26.087 --> 38:29.308
Yeah, I can't explain the money yet.

38:29.519 --> 38:33.466
But I will.
And fake Jenkins was part of the setup.

38:33.486 --> 38:36.902
So whoever he is,
he's somehow in the middle of this.

38:42.142 --> 38:43.930
Martha: Here you go, darling.

38:43.950 --> 38:46.011
Castle: Thank you, mother,
and let me just say,

38:46.045 --> 38:47.679
in the immortal words of Dorothy,

38:47.714 --> 38:49.247
"there's no place like home."

38:49.281 --> 38:50.248
Aw.

38:51.073 --> 38:52.484
Here's what I don't get.

38:52.519 --> 38:54.920
Why would someone do this to you, dad?

38:54.954 --> 38:56.845
Where did you actually go for two months?

38:56.865 --> 38:58.456
Well, those answers lie

38:58.491 --> 39:00.225
within the vast and insidious conspiracy

39:00.259 --> 39:01.337
behind all this,

39:01.357 --> 39:04.629
a tangled web that I fully intend to...

39:04.663 --> 39:05.730
Untangle.

39:05.764 --> 39:07.165
Enough of that.

39:07.199 --> 39:09.200
I'd like to propose a toast.

39:09.235 --> 39:11.994
- To safe returns.
- And no more departures.

39:12.014 --> 39:14.672
And to my amazing mother...

39:14.706 --> 39:16.741
my wonderful daughter...

39:16.775 --> 39:19.172
and the love of my life.

39:19.507 --> 39:21.940
And to coming home.

39:29.517 --> 39:31.316
Beckett: We'll find out what happened.

39:31.336 --> 39:32.890
I know.

39:33.376 --> 39:35.659
I was just thinking...

39:36.078 --> 39:38.595
I feel like I just wore this yesterday,

39:39.242 --> 39:41.965
that we slept in this bed last night.

39:42.667 --> 39:45.102
For you, it must seem like a lifetime ago.

39:45.804 --> 39:47.864
Yeah, it does. [ Chuckles ]

39:48.087 --> 39:50.074
How did you not lose hope?

39:50.108 --> 39:53.076
I did lose hope, you know?
But I...

39:53.895 --> 39:55.478
I would get it back.

39:55.935 --> 39:59.182
Developed rituals in
order to hang on to it.

39:59.216 --> 40:00.316
Like what?

40:00.552 --> 40:03.634
It's...stupid.
It really doesn't matter.

40:03.654 --> 40:05.416
No, I'd like to know.

40:05.578 --> 40:08.757
I would stare at your
photo on the murder board.

40:09.291 --> 40:10.159
And I started thinking

40:10.194 --> 40:13.196
that if I would look at
it long enough every day,

40:13.230 --> 40:15.264
that that would keep you alive.

40:16.772 --> 40:17.876
I guess it worked.

40:17.896 --> 40:20.269
And then I had this thing about your chair.

40:20.304 --> 40:21.704
My chair at the precinct?

40:21.738 --> 40:23.306
I wouldn't let anyone touch it.

40:23.340 --> 40:25.474
And then a night janitor came by.

40:25.508 --> 40:28.176
He tried to move the chair,
and I freaked out, and I...

40:28.211 --> 40:29.845
almost shot him.

40:29.879 --> 40:31.346
[ Chuckles ]

40:39.183 --> 40:40.823
[ Sighs ]

40:45.861 --> 40:47.695
I am so sorry...

40:49.038 --> 40:51.433
For everything I put you through.

40:56.694 --> 40:58.439
It's not your fault. I know. [ Sniffles ]

40:58.473 --> 41:00.411
You went through stuff, too, so...

41:00.431 --> 41:03.745
Well, it's not the same.
I can't remember.

41:03.956 --> 41:07.048
Though I do know I missed you terribly,

41:07.082 --> 41:10.051
because there's no way I wouldn't.

41:15.678 --> 41:18.123
We can't just, um...

41:18.718 --> 41:20.727
pick up where we left off, can we,

41:20.762 --> 41:22.650
as if nothing happened?

41:22.670 --> 41:24.412
No.

41:28.594 --> 41:30.671
We'll get there.

41:31.265 --> 41:33.461
We'll find our way home.
