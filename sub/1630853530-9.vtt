WEBVTT

00:12.513 --> 00:13.597
Hey, baby.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.891
Sorry it's been so long
since my last message.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.101
We've been working around the clock
to dig out the MSAM

00:18.185 --> 00:20.896
and haul it over to Happy Valley
for repairs.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.232
Basically sleeping over there
at this point.

00:23.315 --> 00:27.861
I know that doesn't sound good,
but in a weird way, it's helping me,

00:27.945 --> 00:30.822
helping all of us
to move past what happened.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.618
And I think we might actually be able
to get Popeye back in flying shape

00:34.701 --> 00:37.120
in time for the next launch window
back to Earth.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.747
Problem is, it's going to take a while

00:38.830 --> 00:41.542
to make enough fuel to launch
with the equipment we have left.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.086
Well, that and figuring out a way

00:44.169 --> 00:46.797
to squeeze all nine of us in there
for the launch.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.717
Gonna be as tight as an Apollo capsule,
but we'll get there.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.011
Off this rock, once and for all.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.139
Goddamn this thing.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.224
What now?

00:57.307 --> 01:01.144
Sorry. It's just-- At this rate,
with that puny little fuel generator,

01:01.228 --> 01:04.480
we'll be lucky to have enough propellant
to make our launch date next month.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.733
Can't it work any faster?

01:06.817 --> 01:09.194
It was never meant to process
this much methane.

01:09.278 --> 01:12.447
It's like filling up a jetliner
with a soda can.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.532
Takes time.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.451
I know, I know.
But have you smelled the base lately?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.912
Those toilets were not made
for that many people.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.334
You think once we leave,
they'll ever send anybody back to Mars?

01:24.418 --> 01:27.754
-Doubt it. Not in my lifetime anyway.
-I think you're right.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.886
All we can do is try and get
this thing ready in time for launch.

01:33.969 --> 01:34.970
Roger that.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.182
I'm due back at the sewer.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.352
-Want me to send you anything?
-I already had my ration for today.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.188
Early bird gets the worm.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.356
Worm sounds about right.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.317
Don't work too hard.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.526
Roger that.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.001
All right, what you got?

02:06.668 --> 02:07.753
Ready? All right.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.048
That-- Yeah, you got-- Okay, all right.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.466
You're getting closer, Lou.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.094
-Hey, Skipper.
-How's fuel production going?

02:16.178 --> 02:18.805
"Moving like molasses,"
as you Americans say.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.390
Sort of like you.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.975
Hey.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
How's it?

02:30.526 --> 02:32.402
Hey, hey, hey.
I wasn't finished with that.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.238
Yeah, well, I got seniority.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.080
Here you go, kiddo.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.416
That stuff makes me nauseous.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.751
My grandson gotta eat.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.045
So it's a "him" today?

02:50.128 --> 02:52.089
You know, whichever way it goes.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.424
Edward is a great name. Girl or boy.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.345
I was thinking something like "Ariella."

02:58.428 --> 03:01.723
Ariella? You want her to end up
selling bath beads and patchouli?

03:01.807 --> 03:05.477
Hey, you're gonna need a lot
of homeopathic remedies in your old age.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.729
-Astronaut Baldwin.
-Yeah?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.191
You've been avoiding me. Again.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.944
And failing again.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.112
Follow me.

03:18.949 --> 03:22.160
See? That's why
no one trusts a flight surgeon.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.872
'Cause they're always
on the hunt for bad news.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.542
You mean news like Mars radiation could
damage the child's DNA?

03:29.126 --> 03:31.753
Or weak gravity could impede
its bone development?

03:32.337 --> 03:34.089
Jesus, doc. Go easy.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.261
I will go easy after we get her
up to Phoenix for the birth.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.849
It was not my idea to have a baby
on this forsaken planet.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.269
Yes, as you remind me every day.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.437
Mouth closed.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.524
How is your wound, Commander?

03:52.608 --> 03:56.320
Yeah, cream helped the pain.
Thank you.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.404
Good.

03:58.614 --> 04:01.658
Have you figured out how to make
one of your pressure suits fit her

04:01.742 --> 04:03.202
for the MSAM launch?

04:03.285 --> 04:05.037
The hard shell's still a problem,

04:05.120 --> 04:07.789
but NASA's got two teams
of their best and brightest

04:07.873 --> 04:09.666
working on it around the clock.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.669
Meaning they haven't come up with
anything yet.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.339
So much for NASA's fabled ingenuity.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.176
130 over 85.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.803
Still higher than I'd like.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.850
You should just use Soviet suit.
Material is more flexible.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.691
-Yeah, that might actually work.
-Of course.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.819
Activity?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.990
She's either playing handball
or the bongos in there.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.623
Do you want to hear?

05:09.184 --> 05:10.185
Dad.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.085
Now, by the time Kelly Baldwin gives birth
to America's favorite baby Martian

06:58.168 --> 06:59.378
two months from now…

06:59.461 --> 07:02.756
the child will have enough booties
to last a lifetime.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.842
The decision to proceed
with the pregnancy,

07:04.925 --> 07:06.635
which some regard as controversial

07:06.718 --> 07:09.221
in light of the dangerous conditions
on the planet,

07:09.304 --> 07:12.850
has nonetheless captured the imagination
of people around the world.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.603
And that's why NASA wants the baby
to be born aboard the Phoenix?

07:16.687 --> 07:20.732
That's right. People aboard Phoenix
experience full Earth gravity, which is…

07:20.816 --> 07:23.902
And to distract us from the disaster
that it really is,

07:23.986 --> 07:27.281
the Wilson administration
feeds the media tidbits

07:27.364 --> 07:29.825
about Kelly Baldwin's Mars baby.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.620
Does President Wilson really think
we're that naive?

07:37.583 --> 07:41.170
You and I both know
the Mars program has been a fiasco.

07:41.253 --> 07:44.798
This bill will restore a system
of checks and balances

07:44.882 --> 07:48.093
by giving Congress direct authority
over the agency's budget--

07:48.177 --> 07:52.139
And give you the ability
to redline specific programs.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.560
If I sign this bill,
Congress will defund the Mars program.

07:57.352 --> 08:01.982
No one will go back, maybe ever,
and space exploration will slowly die.

08:03.734 --> 08:07.362
If I were you, Madam President,
I would think less about space

08:07.446 --> 08:09.072
and more about next year's election.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.619
Your concern for my political future
moves me to the brink of tears, Dick.

08:14.786 --> 08:18.332
Have you seen the homeless encampments
spreading across our major cities?

08:18.415 --> 08:22.211
Filled with former oil and gas workers,
coal miners.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.714
People put out of work
by helium-3 and nuclear fusion.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.342
We need to fix things here on Earth

08:28.425 --> 08:31.803
before we spend trillions
gallivanting to far-off planets.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.681
The space program is
making life here on Earth better.

08:34.765 --> 08:37.392
And I won't undermine
all the progress we've made.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.687
So, go ahead and pass your bill, Dick.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.855
And I will veto it.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.986
I'm very disappointed to hear that.

08:49.321 --> 08:52.366
Madam President,
may I speak with you in private?

09:10.509 --> 09:14.054
As I'm sure you're aware,
a few months ago,

09:14.137 --> 09:16.765
staff for Congressman
Willie Baron discovered

09:16.849 --> 09:19.852
that your husband was having an affair
with a White House employee.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.854
A slanderous rumor.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.982
Congressman Baron failed to produce
a shred of evidence for one reason.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.483
It never happened.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.486
So your husband claimed under oath.

09:30.779 --> 09:34.283
If we were to discover that
Mr. Wilson was lying to the committee,

09:34.366 --> 09:37.202
you understand that he would be open
to a charge of perjury?

09:41.206 --> 09:42.541
Where are you going with this?

09:43.417 --> 09:44.418
Madam President,

09:45.460 --> 09:48.547
is it true that you have
a recording system in the Oval Office?

09:52.050 --> 09:53.385
We have a source who claims

09:53.468 --> 09:58.098
that a recording system first installed
by John F. Kennedy is still in use.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.812
Even if there was
a recording system in use,

10:03.896 --> 10:06.815
those tapes would be protected
by executive privilege.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.860
We'll see what the courts say about that.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.655
We are going to subpoena any recordings
made in this office

10:13.739 --> 10:15.908
on the week of your husband's testimony.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.660
If there was any attempt at a cover-up,

10:19.203 --> 10:21.788
not only will he be charged with perjury,

10:21.872 --> 10:25.042
you will be impeached
for obstruction of justice.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.919
You can't be serious.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.797
Congress hasn't impeached a president
in more than 120 years.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.217
This is a new low, even for you.

10:34.051 --> 10:38.430
Well, that's rich coming from a woman
who had Karl Rove and Lee Atwater

10:38.514 --> 10:42.392
to do her dirty work so her image could
remain as pure as driven snow.

10:43.060 --> 10:47.189
All those robocalls about
Bill Clinton's supposed secret love child,

10:47.272 --> 10:49.024
and now you wanna claim the high ground?

10:49.107 --> 10:50.901
What's your point, Dick? Do you have one?

10:52.611 --> 10:54.363
Sign the NASA bill.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.907
It's the smart move.

10:58.784 --> 11:04.456
Because if the press were to find out
about Larry's… indiscretion,

11:04.540 --> 11:08.043
your political standing would evaporate
even more than it already has.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.213
And I'd easily be able
to override your veto.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.134
Now, I don't want to go that road
if I don't have to.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.888
But make no mistake,

11:20.764 --> 11:24.393
I will use every tool at my disposal
to make this bill law.

11:32.818 --> 11:33.819
Glad you could come.

11:34.945 --> 11:36.238
To your garage?

11:36.822 --> 11:40.742
I want you to look at something
and… tell me I'm not crazy.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.504
Jesus Christ.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.090
During the rescue of the cosmonauts,

11:55.174 --> 11:58.427
I discovered that their nuclear
engine design was almost identical

11:58.510 --> 12:00.053
to an early version of ours.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.355
Someone at NASA gave it to them.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.359
Margo?

12:16.195 --> 12:18.322
She's the only one
who had access to everything.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.618
But-- But Margo? Margo Madison?

12:23.493 --> 12:24.620
She's the head of NASA.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.872
She's been trying to beat the Russians
for three decades.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.665
Why would she do this?
It doesn't make sense.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.627
I don't know.
But I can't get this out of my head, Bill.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.047
I feel like I really am going crazy.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.298
Yeah, clearly.

12:37.841 --> 12:41.053
This is like the lair of a Batman villain.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.973
Let me lay it all out for you.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.184
If you still think I'm crazy,

12:49.102 --> 12:50.521
I'll burn all of it.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.609
I'm gonna need another beer.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.248
I'm proud to announce
that we are about to begin production

13:09.331 --> 13:12.668
on Calypso,
which will be ready to launch in 1999.

13:13.252 --> 13:17.840
Unlike Phoenix, Calypso will run
on nuclear plasma propulsion,

13:17.923 --> 13:20.968
and she'll have enough power to travel
to the Red Planet almost anytime,

13:21.051 --> 13:22.803
even outside the normal launch windows.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.763
And we're building two more just like it,

13:24.847 --> 13:28.350
which will allow us to rapidly expand
our footprint on the Red Planet.

13:28.433 --> 13:33.564
Over the next decade, our base will grow
to include several mining operations,

13:33.647 --> 13:36.817
a spaceport, greenhouses for crops,

13:36.900 --> 13:40.279
and dormitories that will house
thousands of colonists in the new--

13:40.362 --> 13:41.905
Just stop there.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.490
Need I remind you,

13:43.574 --> 13:46.159
an entire fucking mountain
just came down on us,

13:46.243 --> 13:48.036
wiping out nearly every asset we had.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.913
Not to mention the three people who died.

13:56.712 --> 13:57.546
Yes.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.758
But do any of you remember Jamestown?

14:01.842 --> 14:03.260
Not the lunar base,

14:03.343 --> 14:07.306
but the first permanent English settlement
in Virginia, founded in 1607.

14:07.389 --> 14:11.768
Do any of you know how many settlers died
in the first three years?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.149
Eighty percent.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.654
From disease.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.574
From starvation.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.076
From the elements.

14:30.037 --> 14:34.374
Suppose the original settlers said,
you know, "This is just-- just too hard.

14:35.125 --> 14:39.421
Let's just forget about this new world
with its unlimited possibilities

14:40.547 --> 14:43.842
and go back to Mother England
with our tail between our legs."

14:44.843 --> 14:46.011
Could you imagine that?

14:47.596 --> 14:48.722
My God, Dicky…

14:50.557 --> 14:52.518
you have lost sight of the big picture.

14:56.438 --> 14:57.481
We found water.

15:00.317 --> 15:05.113
Enough to sustain a colony of thousands.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.701
It doesn't change the fact
that our stock price is in a free fall.

15:09.785 --> 15:12.412
Antitrust lawyers at DOJ
are sniffing around,

15:12.496 --> 15:15.123
and we just got back the liability report
from the accident

15:15.207 --> 15:18.377
saying that one of our employees
caused the fucking landslide.

15:19.044 --> 15:22.881
So on top of everything else,
now we're vulnerable to massive lawsuits.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.426
The board has discussed this at length,

15:26.510 --> 15:30.514
and… we no longer share your optimism.

15:30.597 --> 15:36.854
Helios has squandered billions
on this-- this fantasy of yours.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.858
We've decided to pivot back
to our core business,

15:40.941 --> 15:43.277
mining helium-3 on the moon.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.320
There will be no more missions to Mars.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.084
Guys, I know this is stressful.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.129
No one is more keenly aware
of this than me.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.008
You give me a little more time,

16:07.134 --> 16:08.969
and I'ma pull us out of this hole.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.053
I promise.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.478
You couldn't keep it in your pants
for one term, Larry?

16:19.188 --> 16:20.939
-One term?
-I know I messed up,

16:21.023 --> 16:22.858
but if Baron had more,
he would've used it.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.527
It's go-gonna blow over.
It'll be fine.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.738
"Fine"? You lied under oath.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.698
-Don't you get that?
-They set me up.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.200
Plain and simple. It was a trap.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.577
They didn't force you
to sleep with him, did they?

16:34.661 --> 16:39.249
What is so special about Jeremy Zielke
that you're willing to throw away

16:39.333 --> 16:41.793
everything we've worked
our entire lives to build?

16:41.877 --> 16:43.795
Our careers. Our family.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.678
Well, that was way worse
than I remembered it.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.142
What the hell do we do?

17:01.647 --> 17:05.150
If they hear any of that,
you'll go to jail and I'll be impeached.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.489
We don't need to give in on this.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.990
It's your personal property.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.326
It's protected by executive privilege.

17:14.409 --> 17:18.664
No. They'll take it to the Supreme Court,
and we'll probably lose.

17:19.623 --> 17:23.544
And if we do, it'll weaken not only me
but every president who succeeds me.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.508
Okay, so,

17:31.802 --> 17:33.971
maybe we give the appearance
of cooperating.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.640
Send them transcripts of the tapes.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.433
Black out the incriminating portions

17:38.517 --> 17:40.894
and claim
they relate to national security.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.604
No one will buy that.

17:45.816 --> 17:46.817
No.

17:59.454 --> 18:00.581
Okay, suppose…

18:02.958 --> 18:05.878
Suppose
the recording device malfunctioned.

18:05.961 --> 18:09.631
And for some reason,
this portion is just blank.

18:09.715 --> 18:11.967
We don't know why.
We're not recording technicians.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.051
You mean erase it?

18:14.928 --> 18:17.472
That would expose us
to further charges of obstruction.

18:20.851 --> 18:21.977
You're right.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.733
And what happens
when Jeremy gets out of rehab?

18:28.483 --> 18:30.027
They'll force him to testify.

18:30.986 --> 18:33.238
Would he commit perjury for you?

18:34.865 --> 18:35.908
Probably not.

18:37.826 --> 18:38.827
He was…

18:43.582 --> 18:45.876
He was pretty pissed
about being cut loose.

19:00.682 --> 19:01.767
There is one way out.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.149
I'll call a press conference,

19:09.733 --> 19:14.363
and I'll confess to the world
that I had an affair with Jeremy.

19:16.365 --> 19:19.785
I'll tell them you knew nothing about it.
That you didn't know that I was gay.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.578
That it was all on me.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.039
I betrayed my loving wife…

19:26.875 --> 19:29.962
whose only sin was
falling for a lying philanderer.

19:30.045 --> 19:33.340
Larry, you can't do that.
You'd-- You'd be a--

19:33.423 --> 19:35.133
What? A pariah?

19:35.217 --> 19:37.219
A laughingstock? A national joke?

19:38.428 --> 19:39.805
I'm getting used to that.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.398
I can't let you do this.

19:54.736 --> 19:56.655
Give me a chance to make things right.

20:02.703 --> 20:05.873
And the vibrational profile
of their hydrogen turbopump.

20:05.956 --> 20:09.459
The impeller blade pass frequency
is 2165 hertz.

20:09.543 --> 20:12.129
Exactly the same as ours.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.882
You'd think they would've shifted it
a few hertz to try and hide it.

20:14.965 --> 20:17.426
Yeah, it's like
they're trying to fuck with me.

20:17.509 --> 20:18.802
So I thought it might be Lainey.

20:18.886 --> 20:21.805
She was there
for the whole impeller redesign.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.849
And that's how I eliminated you
as a suspect.

20:24.808 --> 20:25.934
You thought it was me?

20:27.186 --> 20:28.854
You did leave NASA in a hurry.

20:30.606 --> 20:32.733
Can't tell if I'm insulted or flattered.

20:34.151 --> 20:35.277
Anyway,

20:37.029 --> 20:39.990
after this process of elimination…

20:41.992 --> 20:43.493
Margo was the only one left.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.162
It had to be her.

20:48.457 --> 20:49.958
So, what do you think?

20:51.460 --> 20:52.794
Please tell me I'm crazy.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.800
You are not crazy.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.639
We need to talk to her. Find out why she--

21:03.722 --> 21:05.682
You have to go to the FBI, Aleida.

21:05.766 --> 21:06.767
What? No.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.061
No fucking way. Bill…

21:10.062 --> 21:13.899
-you know what they did to my father.
-I know. You think I want this?

21:14.525 --> 21:16.068
I love Margo as much as anybody,

21:16.151 --> 21:19.404
but this is some heavy-duty national
security shit we're talking about.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.865
Who knows how far it's gone?

21:21.949 --> 21:25.118
I mean…
she's basically a fucking spy, Aleida.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.203
-Stop.
-She is.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.497
It makes me wanna vomit,
but it's the truth.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.415
You have to go to the FBI with this.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.167
Bill, no.

21:57.568 --> 22:00.279
-Hey, got a sec?
-Of course.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.615
I've been going through our financials
since the board meeting, and…

22:06.326 --> 22:08.328
I think we need to face reality here.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.164
We can't keep this company solvent,

22:11.665 --> 22:15.043
let alone expand our footprint on Mars,
without an infusion of cash.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.503
And we need it fast.

22:16.587 --> 22:19.590
I'm guessing you have something in mind?

22:20.924 --> 22:24.803
I think that our best move
to generate revenue

22:24.887 --> 22:26.471
and get us out of this hole

22:27.014 --> 22:28.599
is we sell Phoenix to NASA.

22:32.561 --> 22:33.896
Absolutely not.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.314
Are you kidding?

22:36.064 --> 22:37.941
Besides, they'd never go for it.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.234
They will.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.071
What are you talking about?

22:43.155 --> 22:46.116
I approached some people that I know
within the agency

22:46.200 --> 22:48.160
and quietly floated the idea.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.953
And the response was really positive.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.164
-They feel as though--
-You approached NASA

22:52.247 --> 22:53.373
without my permission?

22:54.249 --> 22:56.585
Your permission? I'm COO of this company.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.712
You told them we're so desperate
for cash, we'd be willing--

22:58.795 --> 23:02.299
-That is not what I said at all.
-But they can put the pieces together.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.843
You just gave Margo Madison
all the ammunition she needs

23:04.927 --> 23:06.136
to publicly humiliate me.

23:06.220 --> 23:10.516
I am trying to save your company--
our company-- from insolvency.

23:10.599 --> 23:13.435
-We don't need anybody's help.
-The numbers don't lie.

23:13.519 --> 23:16.522
No, but they don't always tell
the full story.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.568
Have some faith, Karen.

23:26.031 --> 23:27.574
Christ. Look.

23:27.658 --> 23:30.869
The rendezvous radar must have taken
a beating in the slide.

23:30.953 --> 23:31.954
Without that--

23:32.037 --> 23:33.956
Popeye won't be able to dock with Phoenix.

23:34.039 --> 23:35.499
Maybe it's not that bad.

23:36.291 --> 23:38.001
Help me get this housing off.

23:41.839 --> 23:45.008
Oh, shit. Shit! Shit! Shit!

23:47.678 --> 23:49.263
Primary integration card is toast.

23:51.682 --> 23:53.183
And the spare is aboard Phoenix.

23:54.768 --> 23:56.144
Might as well be on Jupiter.

23:57.312 --> 23:59.815
Will, does Sojourner have
a rendezvous system we can use?

23:59.898 --> 24:03.110
Negative. It was a part
of the original design,

24:03.193 --> 24:04.945
but it was never installed.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.947
-Why not?
-Well, we weren't planning on docking

24:07.030 --> 24:08.323
with anything on this mission,

24:08.407 --> 24:11.994
and, we were in a big-ass hurry
to catch you guys and launch in '94.

24:12.578 --> 24:15.581
Yes. Free-market competition
pays dividends yet again.

24:15.664 --> 24:16.915
Yeah.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.542
What are we gonna do?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.335
We can't dock with Phoenix.

24:20.419 --> 24:22.546
We'll miss
the next launch window to Earth.

24:22.629 --> 24:23.797
We'll be stranded here.

24:27.718 --> 24:29.636
We can't fabricate one of these ourselves?

24:29.720 --> 24:32.264
Unless you want to go to Kyiv
for the parts.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.683
It's a damn shame Helios didn't buy
their rendezvous systems

24:34.766 --> 24:35.934
from the good old US of A.

24:36.018 --> 24:38.478
Yeah, and Popeye won't get
close enough to Phoenix

24:38.562 --> 24:40.272
for dock and capture without it.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.110
Pity we didn't take this Kurs unit
from the Soviet ship

24:45.194 --> 24:46.403
before we cut her loose.

24:47.112 --> 24:52.034
Well, there are more of them
already here on Mars.

24:56.788 --> 24:57.873
-There are?
-Where?

25:00.334 --> 25:03.253
We have five Kurs Novaya-Aktivnaya units

25:03.337 --> 25:04.671
on the surface of Mars.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.381
They're on sample-return probes

25:06.465 --> 25:08.926
we were hoping to retrieve
with our Mars ship.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.553
The problem is,

25:11.637 --> 25:16.141
the closest one is
over 1,500 kilometers from Happy Valley.

25:16.225 --> 25:18.310
The trip would take a month
if everything goes right,

25:18.393 --> 25:21.605
and we can't wait that long
to get Kelly Baldwin up to Phoenix.

25:22.397 --> 25:23.482
Miss Catiche,

25:24.691 --> 25:28.195
didn't Russia sell your rendezvous system
to other countries?

25:28.278 --> 25:29.279
It is true.

25:29.363 --> 25:35.577
We sold Kurs units
to India, Turkey and to North Korea.

25:35.661 --> 25:39.289
Bill, does Helios have a way
of accessing the locations

25:39.373 --> 25:44.336
of every Turkish, North Korean
and Indian probe that's been sent to Mars?

25:45.045 --> 25:46.630
Sure. Yeah, one second.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.929
How far is the closest?

25:54.471 --> 25:57.975
So this one here is 89 kilometers out.

25:58.058 --> 26:02.771
It looks like it belongs to
the People's Republic of Korea.

26:02.855 --> 26:05.774
That's the probe they launched
in the '94 window.

26:06.692 --> 26:09.778
I remember it docked in low Earth orbit,
probably to refuel.

26:09.862 --> 26:12.948
Which makes it pretty certain that it has
an automated docking system.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.616
It will be Kurs-NA.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.160
Or a clone of it.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.288
I'd say we have a winner.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.129
North Korea approved this?

26:27.921 --> 26:31.425
Better to ask for forgiveness later
than beg for permission now.

26:31.508 --> 26:34.428
This goes against
almost all of our safety protocols.

26:35.053 --> 26:36.722
We can only spare one rover.

26:36.805 --> 26:40.601
It's nine hours each way,
far beyond walk-back range.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.769
Sounds like fun. Sign me up.

26:43.353 --> 26:46.607
Sorry, Ed. You're more familiar
with the Helios systems than anybody…

26:46.690 --> 26:48.358
-Come on.
-…and we need those working

26:48.442 --> 26:49.610
to get off this planet.

26:49.693 --> 26:52.321
No, no. I'm not risking
any of your people on this.

26:53.363 --> 26:55.616
Kurs-NA is a newer design,

26:55.699 --> 26:58.243
and Baranov isn't familiar
with the new iteration,

26:59.077 --> 27:02.581
and Mayakovsky's required here
for pregnancy.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.792
The rovers are NASA gear.

27:06.460 --> 27:10.464
Will is working on the MSAM,
so the choice is pretty clear.

27:14.343 --> 27:15.385
You and me.

27:24.937 --> 27:27.314
I can't fucking believe you did this.

27:27.397 --> 27:28.899
Just hear what she has to say.

27:30.901 --> 27:31.902
Here you go.

27:33.779 --> 27:35.155
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

27:42.371 --> 27:44.164
Look, whatever you think is gonna happen,

27:44.248 --> 27:46.416
you should know
I don't care much for the FBI.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.461
I wouldn't either if I were you.

27:50.671 --> 27:52.464
Bill told me what happened
with your father.

27:53.757 --> 27:54.800
It wasn't right.

27:58.512 --> 27:59.721
Well, isn't that nice?

28:00.472 --> 28:03.058
What else did you share
with your little friend here, Bill?

28:03.141 --> 28:05.602
-I'm just trying to help you.
-Gee. Thanks.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.146
I know this is not
an easy position to be in,

28:08.230 --> 28:11.567
and I am truly sorry
about what happened to your father.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.737
Frankly, I don't blame you
for not trusting us.

28:17.364 --> 28:21.285
And I'm guessing it's just a coincidence
that they had you talk to me,

28:22.369 --> 28:23.453
of all the agents.

28:25.998 --> 28:27.165
I'm sure it's not.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.044
Look, the FBI is not perfect.

28:31.128 --> 28:35.174
But you and I, we both took the same oath
when we started working for this country,

28:35.257 --> 28:38.260
to support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

28:38.343 --> 28:41.805
against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

28:43.891 --> 28:46.268
And I know you care
about what happened here,

28:46.351 --> 28:48.145
or you wouldn't have reached out to Bill.

28:59.698 --> 29:02.409
I don't care what the fuck you say.

29:03.493 --> 29:04.786
I'm not helping you.

29:07.915 --> 29:09.333
That's your choice.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.418
You don't have to cooperate,

29:11.502 --> 29:13.587
but we're moving forward
with this regardless.

29:13.670 --> 29:16.298
The case file is open.
We'll get to the bottom of what happened.

29:16.381 --> 29:18.884
And at some point,
you'll be called to testify against her.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.762
-Is that a threat?
-No. It's a fact.

29:25.182 --> 29:26.183
So be it.

29:26.266 --> 29:28.644
Come on, Aleida.
Just sit down. Just hear what--

29:28.727 --> 29:31.104
I don't wanna hear another word
out of you. Do you get that?

29:33.649 --> 29:34.983
You're fucking dead to me.

30:38.922 --> 30:40.841
Aleida? Aleida!

30:42.926 --> 30:44.178
What's the matter?

30:45.888 --> 30:47.848
Are you okay?

30:47.931 --> 30:51.351
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

30:51.435 --> 30:52.769
Are you in trouble?

30:55.314 --> 30:56.440
My daughter.

31:05.532 --> 31:06.909
No, Papa.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.077
It's nothing.

31:12.039 --> 31:13.457
I'll figure it out.

31:15.792 --> 31:16.793
There…

31:18.212 --> 31:20.255
There, there, there…

31:21.632 --> 31:22.841
My Graciana…

31:24.134 --> 31:25.719
Don't cry.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.304
Don't cry, my love.

31:30.516 --> 31:31.517
Graciana?

31:35.062 --> 31:36.313
No, Papa.

31:37.439 --> 31:39.024
It's your daughter, Aleida.

31:40.651 --> 31:41.693
Not Mama.

31:43.654 --> 31:44.696
I know.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.991
I know, my daughter.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.618
Everything will be all right.

31:51.620 --> 31:52.829
Everything will be all right.

32:05.259 --> 32:09.096
Danielle, how many spare batteries
do you think we need?

32:09.179 --> 32:12.516
We'll be back by tomorrow.
The extra weight will just slow us down.

32:12.599 --> 32:14.518
I'd rather have the juice and not need it.

32:14.601 --> 32:18.856
Solar cells can break, and I don't fancy
an 89-kilometer walk back home. Do you?

32:21.567 --> 32:23.569
Happy Valley. Phoenix.

32:26.697 --> 32:28.282
Happy Valley. Phoenix.

32:29.867 --> 32:31.285
Phoenix. Happy Valley.

32:31.368 --> 32:32.828
Priority uplink from Helios.

32:32.911 --> 32:35.080
It's the drilling accident
investigation report.

32:35.163 --> 32:37.249
Sending it over now.

32:38.584 --> 32:41.211
Finally. They took
their good sweet time about it.

32:43.839 --> 32:46.049
-Got it, Phoenix.
-Roger. Phoenix out.

32:48.719 --> 32:49.887
What does it say?

32:49.970 --> 32:52.472
It's wrapped up
in a bunch of bureaucratic verbiage,

32:52.556 --> 32:56.727
but bottom line,
they're calling it an operator error.

32:58.729 --> 32:59.813
Who?

32:59.897 --> 33:02.566
They're putting it on Nick Corrado
for, quote,

33:02.649 --> 33:05.027
"failure to correctly monitor
housing pressure

33:05.110 --> 33:08.030
and take appropriate action
at reservoir penetration,"

33:08.113 --> 33:09.198
end quote.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.283
Typical cover-your-ass move.

33:11.366 --> 33:12.743
Yep, blame the dead guy.

33:12.826 --> 33:15.120
Then you can't be sued
for building crappy gear.

33:15.204 --> 33:17.873
-Same in the Soviet system.
-This is bullshit.

33:18.916 --> 33:20.375
But to put that on Nick?

33:21.710 --> 33:23.795
I mean, it's bad enough
the landslide killed him,

33:23.879 --> 33:27.216
but now they're trying to pin
the whole thing on him? It's not right.

33:27.299 --> 33:29.510
I mean,
how'd they even come up with that report?

33:32.930 --> 33:36.099
Yeah, this whole thing,
it's a load of bullshit!

33:48.445 --> 33:49.446
Yeah?

33:50.197 --> 33:51.865
Heard about your plan to sell Phoenix.

33:53.534 --> 33:54.535
Dev told you?

33:54.618 --> 33:57.079
Well, we're not exactly speaking
at the moment.

33:57.162 --> 34:01.333
Like you, I've got contacts at NASA,
and they're very keen on this idea.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.169
Yeah, I know. Come on in.

34:05.087 --> 34:08.715
I tried to sell Dev on the idea,
and he just wouldn't listen.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.717
He's… changed.

34:12.344 --> 34:13.762
Quite a bit since we first met.

34:13.846 --> 34:15.556
At MIT, right?

34:15.639 --> 34:17.558
Intro to Nuclear Physics.

34:17.641 --> 34:20.310
Where you two first figured out
how to crack nuclear fusion.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.312
Yeah, and back then everyone was desperate

34:22.396 --> 34:25.023
to be the one
who finally figured fusion out.

34:25.107 --> 34:28.902
Trouble was,
nobody could make the reaction last.

34:29.695 --> 34:30.737
Until Dev.

34:31.487 --> 34:34.199
He figured out a way
to bring helium-3 nuclei together

34:34.283 --> 34:35.701
and keep the reaction going.

34:35.784 --> 34:38.579
And brought the world cheap, clean energy.

34:39.871 --> 34:43.333
Watching him work,
I knew I was in the presence of greatness.

34:44.251 --> 34:47.004
He was unlike
any other engineer I'd ever met.

34:48.964 --> 34:52.176
So, what happened? Why are you two
always at each other's throats?

34:52.259 --> 34:53.260
Simple.

34:54.011 --> 34:55.846
I'm the only one who tells him "no."

34:55.929 --> 34:58.265
The little word no one likes to hear.

34:58.348 --> 35:01.226
-Especially not Dev.
-No. No.

35:01.310 --> 35:04.313
The man's been swallowed alive
by his own myth.

35:05.522 --> 35:07.816
And now so will this company.

35:07.900 --> 35:12.321
Unless we move forward with your plan,
selling Phoenix to NASA.

35:13.655 --> 35:15.949
I've already pitched the idea
to the board.

35:16.033 --> 35:20.454
-They think it's a stroke of genius.
-And Dev is never going to approve it.

35:20.537 --> 35:23.957
That won't be an issue.
We've decided to remove him as CEO.

35:25.751 --> 35:28.504
You-- I'm sorry, you're firing Dev?

35:28.587 --> 35:33.008
He'll still have a seat on the board,
but strictly in an advisory capacity.

35:34.593 --> 35:36.428
Who are you going to get to replace him?

35:38.722 --> 35:39.765
You.

35:52.361 --> 35:53.362
Lar?

35:54.446 --> 35:56.240
Hi. What time is it?

35:56.323 --> 35:59.034
It's a little after 9:00.
You-- You want me to take him up to bed?

35:59.117 --> 36:01.662
No, no, that's okay. I can do it.
Come on, pal.

36:01.745 --> 36:02.746
You ready?

36:04.414 --> 36:06.458
Ready? Three, two, one.

36:06.542 --> 36:08.252
Oh, my gosh. You're heavy.

36:08.335 --> 36:09.461
Goodness gracious.

36:12.548 --> 36:13.549
Larry?

36:16.093 --> 36:17.302
About tomorrow…

36:18.470 --> 36:19.805
You don't have to do this.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.057
We can find another way.

36:22.808 --> 36:25.310
We've been over that.
There is no other way.

36:27.354 --> 36:29.064
I wanna do this. I need to.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.175
Hello, everyone.

38:21.218 --> 38:23.387
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.398
I'd like to share something.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.067
I…

38:41.989 --> 38:44.575
I have something
I'd like to share with you all…

38:54.501 --> 38:55.502
Good morning.

38:58.088 --> 39:01.884
First of all, I would like to thank
the American people for their support

39:01.967 --> 39:03.218
over the last two years.

39:03.302 --> 39:05.012
Together, we have achieved great things.

39:05.095 --> 39:09.349
Making America energy independent,
sharply reducing greenhouse gases

39:09.433 --> 39:11.268
and developing new technologies

39:11.351 --> 39:14.730
that will assure the United States remains
a dominant superpower

39:14.813 --> 39:16.481
well into the 21st century.

39:16.565 --> 39:20.527
And, of course, there was
our first manned mission to Mars.

39:20.611 --> 39:23.488
And despite the recent casualties,

39:23.572 --> 39:28.493
our journey to the Red Planet will go down
in history as a remarkable achievement,

39:28.577 --> 39:31.038
equal to the Lewis and Clark expedition,

39:31.121 --> 39:33.457
Ferdinand Magellan
circumnavigating the Earth,

39:33.540 --> 39:37.920
and Aleksei Leonov landing on the moon
in June of 1969.

39:41.089 --> 39:45.552
And yet, after all we have accomplished,

39:45.636 --> 39:47.804
I come before you today

39:49.389 --> 39:52.476
to confess that I have failed you.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.313
Because I lied to you.

39:58.232 --> 40:02.027
And in doing so,
I broke the covenant of trust

40:02.110 --> 40:05.697
that is essential between a president
and the American people.

40:09.535 --> 40:11.912
I not only failed to tell you the truth,

40:12.412 --> 40:17.292
I also failed to protect the men and women
serving bravely in our armed forces.

40:18.544 --> 40:22.089
I failed to stand up for some of
our most vulnerable fellow citizens

40:22.172 --> 40:26.093
who have faced acts of prejudice
and discrimination.

40:28.220 --> 40:32.057
And I failed to defend the rights
and the dignity of Will Tyler,

40:33.559 --> 40:35.519
a brave American hero

40:36.228 --> 40:40.065
serving his country on the surface of Mars
at this very moment.

40:42.568 --> 40:46.530
And I failed someone very close to me

40:47.614 --> 40:52.077
because I was afraid to stand up
and tell the truth.

40:54.204 --> 40:56.999
I failed because I feared
what people would think of me,

40:57.833 --> 41:02.087
and I failed to trust the compassion
and judgment of you,

41:02.713 --> 41:04.381
the American people.

41:04.464 --> 41:06.091
I underestimated you.

41:07.467 --> 41:09.678
And for that, I am truly sorry.

41:15.809 --> 41:18.187
I cannot correct my past mistakes,

41:18.270 --> 41:21.190
but I can stop lying to you

41:21.273 --> 41:25.235
right here, right now,
and give you the simple truth.

41:29.781 --> 41:31.074
I'm gay,

41:32.117 --> 41:35.037
and I have been since the day I was born.

42:15.452 --> 42:17.287
Reactions to President Wilson's speech

42:17.371 --> 42:19.414
have varied across the political spectrum,

42:19.498 --> 42:21.708
with rallies in every major city.

42:21.792 --> 42:25.045
Some have marched in support of
the nation's first gay president,

42:25.128 --> 42:28.799
while vocal counterprotests denounce her
as a dangerous influence.

42:28.882 --> 42:32.261
The Wilson Administration followed
the president's address to the nation

42:32.344 --> 42:35.305
with an announcement today
that she will sign an executive order

42:35.389 --> 42:39.059
to allow gay men and women
to openly serve in the military.

42:39.142 --> 42:42.729
She also announced she will bestow
a presidential medal of freedom

42:42.813 --> 42:44.064
on Will Tyler

42:44.147 --> 42:47.442
for his extraordinary service
to his country on Mars

42:47.526 --> 42:50.529
and for his courageous stand
on gay rights.

42:51.196 --> 42:52.906
Well, holy shit!

42:54.157 --> 42:56.785
-About time America came to her senses.
-Nice work, Ellen.

42:56.869 --> 42:58.245
I have something to say.

43:03.500 --> 43:06.170
You're a brave man, Will Tyler.

43:15.846 --> 43:20.559
I'm honored… to be your friend.

43:25.480 --> 43:26.732
Thank you, man.

43:36.366 --> 43:38.118
All right, enough of this.
Let's start drinking.

43:39.161 --> 43:41.580
I'm sure Kelly'd wanna hear about this.
Have you seen her?

43:41.663 --> 43:42.664
She's in the jungle.

43:44.291 --> 43:47.085
Kel, you have no idea
what President Wilson just--

43:48.253 --> 43:49.505
Kelly! Kel!

43:50.130 --> 43:52.549
Kel! Hey, hey! Sweetie?

43:55.719 --> 43:57.513
Doc! Get in here!

44:05.646 --> 44:07.731
-Mueller, bring the medkit!
-Yes, sir!

44:07.814 --> 44:09.358
Kelly?

44:09.441 --> 44:11.485
Her heart is pumping too fast.

44:11.568 --> 44:13.070
Hang in there, kiddo.

44:16.406 --> 44:18.200
Rover 1, Happy Valley.

44:18.700 --> 44:20.953
Rover 1, Happy Valley. Come in.

44:21.036 --> 44:22.704
Happy Valley, rover 1.

44:22.788 --> 44:24.915
We've had an emergency here.

44:24.998 --> 44:27.376
Kelly's condition has taken
a turn for the worst.

44:27.459 --> 44:28.669
What's going on?

44:28.752 --> 44:30.546
The doctor says she has preeclampsia.

44:30.629 --> 44:33.382
We need you back here
with the Kurs system, and fast.

44:34.967 --> 44:38.679
We are less than 15 minutes away
from the probe site.

44:38.762 --> 44:40.931
We will be back as soon as we can.

44:41.014 --> 44:42.015
Roger.

45:00.242 --> 45:01.994
Looks like one of your old Soyuz ships.

45:02.661 --> 45:05.747
People's Republic of Korea
isn't shy about borrowing designs.

45:06.373 --> 45:08.292
What matters is it has a Kurs antenna.

45:08.959 --> 45:10.711
Well, let's get it and go.

45:13.463 --> 45:14.631
Danielle?

45:18.260 --> 45:20.429
What in the hell?

45:35.444 --> 45:38.405
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!
