10:14.600 --> 10:15.966
TO READ A BOOK LIKE THAT AND

10:16.033 --> 10:18.033
THINK I NEED TO BE TREATED THAT

10:18.100 --> 10:18.200
WAY.

10:18.266 --> 10:19.566
I AM GOING TO START ACTIVELY

10:19.633 --> 10:21.733
PARSING IT THAT WAY, I DON'T

10:21.800 --> 10:23.900
THINK PEOPLE REALIZE WHAT SILLY

10:23.966 --> 10:24.766
BABIES BOOKS LIKE THAT MAKE US

10:24.833 --> 10:29.800
LOOK LIKE.

10:29.866 --> 10:33.500
[APPLAUSE]

10:33.566 --> 10:36.000
>> Bill: TO BE FAIR, I THINK

10:36.066 --> 10:37.000
MOST BLACK FOLKS DO AGREE WITH

10:37.066 --> 10:41.300
YOU, IT'S JUST THE ONES COME UP

10:41.366 --> 10:42.066
PEOPLE BLACK-AND-WHITE OR

10:42.133 --> 10:42.366
ON TWITTER.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.633
>> I KNOW WHEN I SAY THESE

10:44.700 --> 10:46.833
THINGS IT'S NOT JUST ME AND

10:46.900 --> 10:47.633
COLEMAN HUGHES AND GLENN LOWRY

10:47.700 --> 10:49.066
AND TWO OR THREE OTHER PEOPLE IF

10:49.133 --> 10:50.533
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT I

10:50.600 --> 10:52.566
WOULDN'T SAY "LOOK AT THE WAY WE

10:52.633 --> 10:55.966
WEIRDOS FEEL."

10:56.033 --> 10:57.233
I'VE BEEN BLACK PRETTY MUCH FOR

10:57.300 --> 10:59.233
55 YEARS AND I KNOW HOW BLACK

10:59.300 --> 11:00.433
PEOPLE FEEL AND I ALWAYS THINK

11:00.500 --> 11:02.133
THIS CERTAIN SLIVER OF PEOPLE IN

11:02.200 --> 11:03.700
THE MEDIA AND ACADEMIA ARE OFTEN

11:03.766 --> 11:06.100
MUCH SMARTER THAN ME BUT THAT IS

11:06.166 --> 11:07.533
NOT THE REPRESENTATIVE VIEW.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.100
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE GOING TO

11:10.166 --> 11:12.633
READ "HOW TO BE AN ANTIRACIST."

11:12.700 --> 11:13.933
THAT IS NOT THE GENERAL BLACK

11:14.000 --> 11:15.100
VIEW OF THINGS, IT'S LIKE THE

11:15.166 --> 11:15.466
BIE.

11:15.533 --> 11:16.333
THAT BOOK IF YOU MUST READ IT

11:16.400 --> 11:19.500
SHOULD BE READ AS LITERATURE

11:19.566 --> 11:22.566
RATHER THAN AS SCHOLARSHIP.

11:22.633 --> 11:23.566
IT'S NOT GENERAL.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.866
AND YET WE ARE TOLD THAT SOMEHOW

11:25.933 --> 11:27.633
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THESE SORTS OF

11:27.700 --> 11:28.333
THINGS AS THE BLACK OF YOU AND

11:28.400 --> 11:29.966
YOU WILL SEE IT ON TWITTER.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.400
A BLACK PERSON WILL WRITE

11:31.466 --> 11:32.266
ON TWITTER, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN

11:32.333 --> 11:33.566
TO THE BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE THE

11:33.633 --> 11:35.233
REAL BLACK PEOPLE, THE BLACK

11:35.300 --> 11:37.466
PEOPLE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO -- IS

11:37.533 --> 11:38.600
A GREAT DEAL OF DIVERSITY IN THE

11:38.666 --> 11:39.566
BLACK COMMUNITY AND I CAN TELL

11:39.633 --> 11:41.033
YOU IT'S NOT FOR THE DEFAULT IN

11:41.100 --> 11:44.666
THE BLACK COMMUNITY TO THINK OF

11:44.733 --> 11:46.033
OURSELVES AS PATHETIC.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.500
"YES WE CAN'T" HAS NEVER BEEN

11:47.566 --> 11:48.366
THE SLOGAN FOR BLACK AMERICA AND

11:48.433 --> 11:49.900
IT'S NOT NOW.

11:49.966 --> 11:57.033
[APPLAUSE]

11:57.100 --> 11:59.166
>> Bill: I REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP

11:59.233 --> 12:00.966
WAS RUNNING IN 2016 HIS PITCH TO

12:01.033 --> 12:04.200
THE BLACK COMMUNITY WAS "WHAT DO

12:04.266 --> 12:04.966
YOU GOT TO LOSE?

12:05.033 --> 12:06.966
YOU WALK OUT YOUR DOOR YOU GET

12:07.033 --> 12:09.466
SHOT."

12:09.533 --> 12:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

12:12.066 --> 12:13.733
AND I THOUGHT WHAT AN INSULT,

12:13.800 --> 12:17.500
MOST BLACK PEOPLE LIVE IN THE

12:17.566 --> 12:18.266
SUBURBS.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.600
ALMOST TWO-THIRDS ARE

12:20.666 --> 12:22.000
MIDDLE-CLASS.

12:22.066 --> 12:23.466
SOME ARE NOT IN THE MIDDLE CLASS

12:23.533 --> 12:24.466
BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING VERY

12:24.533 --> 12:26.333
WELL -- THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE

12:26.400 --> 12:29.166
ISN'T STILL RACISM IN THIS

12:29.233 --> 12:31.133
COUNTRY, OF COURSE, THERE ARE

12:31.200 --> 12:32.500
PROBLEMS AND BIG DIFFERENCES IN

12:32.566 --> 12:35.066
EQUALITY AND WEALTH.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.200
WHICH OF COURSE SHOULD BE

12:37.266 --> 12:38.200
ADDRESSED.

12:38.266 --> 12:41.433
BUT IF I MAY AMEND ONE THING YOU

12:41.500 --> 12:43.800
SAID -- THOSE PEOPLE YOU

12:43.866 --> 12:45.766
MENTIONED ARE NOT SMARTER THAN

12:45.833 --> 12:48.766
YOU.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.700
>> MADE A NOISE ON TV.

12:50.766 --> 12:52.600
[APPLAUSE]

12:52.666 --> 12:54.333
>> Bill: ONE THING I LOVE THAT

12:54.400 --> 12:55.766
YOU SAY, ONCE IN A WHILE OVER

12:55.833 --> 12:57.433
THE YEARS HAVE CRITICIZED

12:57.500 --> 12:58.500
RELIGION, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

12:58.566 --> 12:58.766
KNOW THAT.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.800
>> EVERY NOW AND THEN, YES.

13:00.866 --> 13:02.533
>> Bill: THE FACT THAT YOU

13:02.600 --> 13:03.733
CHARACTERIZE SOME OF THIS

13:03.800 --> 13:05.166
WOKENESS AS RELIGION APPEALED TO

13:05.233 --> 13:05.866
ME.

13:05.933 --> 13:08.033
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RELIGION WE

13:08.100 --> 13:10.166
ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE

13:10.233 --> 13:13.333
ORIGINAL SIN.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.766
>> WHITE PRIVILEGE.

13:14.833 --> 13:15.266
IF.

13:15.333 --> 13:15.966
>> Bill: WHITENESS, I'VE NEVER

13:16.033 --> 13:19.166
HEARD THE TERM WHITENESS BEFORE.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.000
>> YOU SEND WHEN YOU WERE A BABY

13:21.066 --> 13:21.766
WHEN YOU CAME OUT AND YOU WILL

13:21.833 --> 13:22.866
NEVER GET RID OF YOUR WHITE

13:22.933 --> 13:23.666
PRIVILEGE NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO

13:23.733 --> 13:25.233
COME YOU'RE GOING TO DIE WITH

13:25.300 --> 13:26.500
IT, THE ONLY GOOD THING IS TO

13:26.566 --> 13:28.966
PUT YOURSELF ON FACEBOOK SAYING

13:29.033 --> 13:32.633
"I'M DOING THE WORK."

13:32.700 --> 13:35.633
AND THAT WAY YOU ARE ATONING FOR

13:35.700 --> 13:42.300
YOUR WHITE PRIVILEGE.

13:42.366 --> 13:42.566
[LAUGHTER]

13:42.633 --> 13:43.566
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

13:43.633 --> 13:44.733
>> Bill: YOU CALL YOURSELF A

13:44.800 --> 13:48.166
CRANKY LIBERAL, CRANKY DEMOCRAT?

13:48.233 --> 13:49.033
>> Bill: I AM ALL OF THOSE

13:49.100 --> 13:49.266
THINGS.

13:49.333 --> 13:52.133
>> Bill: ME TOO.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.133
FOR PEOPLE WATCHING US SAYING

13:53.200 --> 13:55.933
"HOW DARE THEY --

13:56.000 --> 13:58.300
>> THERE ARE A FEW.

13:58.366 --> 14:01.400
>> Bill: LIBERALISM HAS

14:01.466 --> 14:02.866
CHANGED ESPECIALLY AS RACIAL

14:02.933 --> 14:04.766
MATTERS GO IN THE LAST FIVE

14:04.833 --> 14:06.666
YEARS AND HERE ARE SOME NEW

14:06.733 --> 14:07.633
IDEAS, NEW TO ME AND I DON'T

14:07.700 --> 14:11.966
AGREE WITH MOST OF THEM.

14:12.033 --> 14:14.533
ONE, IT'S NEVER BEEN WORSE.

14:14.600 --> 14:19.266
>> IT'S TERRIBLE, 1850 AND NOW

14:19.333 --> 14:20.366
IT'S WORSE.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.800
1966, IT'S GOTTEN SO MUCH WORSE.

14:21.866 --> 14:23.333
THESE ARE PEOPLE TOO YOUNG TO A

14:23.400 --> 14:25.733
MEMBER THE WAY IT WAS FOR

14:25.800 --> 14:26.833
FRANKLY IT'S THE VICTIM COMPLEX

14:26.900 --> 14:27.933
WHICH FEELS GOOD IN THE MOMENT

14:28.033 --> 14:30.700
BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

14:30.766 --> 14:32.200
REALITY AND IT'S DEFEATIST.

14:32.266 --> 14:32.733
>> Bill: I THINK IT'S THE

14:32.800 --> 14:34.066
FIRST THING YOU SAID.

14:34.133 --> 14:38.033
[APPLAUSE]

14:38.100 --> 14:39.100
THE YOUNGER GENERATION FEELS

14:39.166 --> 14:41.200
LIKE IF SOMETHING DIDN'T HAPPEN

14:41.266 --> 14:43.066
WHILE THEY WERE ALIVE, IT DIDN'T

14:43.133 --> 14:43.300
HAPPEN.

14:43.366 --> 14:44.866
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

14:44.933 --> 14:48.400
>> Bill: I CAN'T, IT'S STUPID.

14:48.466 --> 14:49.366
IT'S CALLED HISTORY, I'VE HEARD

14:49.433 --> 14:51.100
THEM SAY IT ON THIS SHOW.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.300
I WASN'T AROUND FOR IT -- I

14:53.366 --> 14:54.333
WASN'T AROUND FOR THE

14:54.400 --> 14:56.666
FRENCH REVOLUTION BUT I KNOW

14:56.733 --> 14:59.633
ABOUT IT.

14:59.700 --> 15:03.200
[APPLAUSE]

15:03.266 --> 15:05.600
>> I SYMPATHIZE A LITTLE BIT

15:05.666 --> 15:06.566
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH

15:06.633 --> 15:07.000
TECHNOLOGY.

15:07.066 --> 15:09.266
I THINK YOU COULD BE AS OLD AS

15:09.333 --> 15:10.200
40 AT THIS POINT, THE WAY IT

15:10.266 --> 15:12.166
USED TO BE IT LOOKS SO VERY

15:12.233 --> 15:13.266
DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S IN

15:13.333 --> 15:14.600
BLACK-AND-WHITE OFTEN AFTER

15:14.666 --> 15:17.000
THINGS ARE IN COLOR, THEY LOOK

15:17.066 --> 15:19.233
REAL AND ALSO BLACK HISTORY WAS

15:19.300 --> 15:21.333
RELATIVELY QUIESCENT IN THE

15:21.400 --> 15:22.100
1970s AND INTO THE 80s SO

15:22.166 --> 15:26.366
IT'S EASY TO MISS HOW DIFFERENT

15:26.433 --> 15:28.500
1965 WAS FROM 1985 BECAUSE YOU

15:28.566 --> 15:30.700
DON'T HAVE INTERESTING EVENTS TO

15:30.766 --> 15:30.900
CHART.

15:30.966 --> 15:32.266
I CAN HAVE SOME SYMPATHY FOR IT

15:32.333 --> 15:33.100
BUT ANYBODY WHO THINKS NOW IS

15:33.166 --> 15:36.500
JUST AS BAD AS THE WAY IT WAS IN

15:36.566 --> 15:37.466
1970 EXCEPT THAT MANORS HAVE

15:37.533 --> 15:38.400
CHANGED, NO.

15:38.466 --> 15:41.300
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT

15:41.366 --> 15:43.233
IN 1990 ABOUT 1970, THAT WAS

15:43.300 --> 15:43.966
KIND OF TRUE.

15:44.033 --> 15:45.200
BUT TIME PASSES.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.133
IT'S EASIER TO BELIEVE THAT

15:47.200 --> 15:48.033
CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN.

15:48.100 --> 15:51.333
IN A WAY MORE TEMPTING AND MORE

15:51.400 --> 15:53.566
FUN BECAUSE YOU HAVE A REASON TO

15:53.633 --> 15:55.300
GET ANGRY THAN TO ALLOW CHANGE

15:55.366 --> 15:56.500
SLOWLY AND TO WATCH IT HAPPEN

15:56.566 --> 15:58.600
AND TO APPLAUD, YOU'RE SUPPOSED

15:58.666 --> 15:59.900
TO BE HAPPY THAT THINGS CHANGE.

15:59.966 --> 16:02.266
BUT WE ARE TAUGHT TO THE

16:02.333 --> 16:02.866
AUTHENTIC BLACK POSITION IS TO

16:02.933 --> 16:05.133
PRETEND IT NEVER DOES.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.133
>> Bill: WE AREN'T SAYING

16:06.200 --> 16:07.433
THERE ISN'T STILL A GREAT DEAL

16:07.500 --> 16:09.200
OF WORK TO BE DONE.

16:09.266 --> 16:10.800
>> NOT SAYING IT AT ALL.

16:10.866 --> 16:13.100
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S

16:13.166 --> 16:14.633
ON TWITTER.

16:14.700 --> 16:17.133
"DON'T THEY KNOW ABOUT SYSTEMIC

16:17.200 --> 16:17.666
RACISM?

16:17.733 --> 16:19.866
"YES, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

16:19.933 --> 16:21.866
WHY IS IT NOT BLACK TO ADDRESS A

16:21.933 --> 16:24.000
DEGREE, IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE

16:24.066 --> 16:24.700
UNSOPHISTICATED WORDS LIKE

16:24.766 --> 16:25.533
QUANTUM PHYSICS WHERE EVERYTHING

16:25.600 --> 16:26.200
IS ON AND OFF?

16:26.266 --> 16:27.566
THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES.

16:27.633 --> 16:28.533
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOCIAL

16:28.600 --> 16:29.766
HISTORY THERE IS THE ISSUE OF

16:29.833 --> 16:31.433
DEGREE AND IF THAT MAKES ME A

16:31.500 --> 16:33.366
WHITE SUPREMACIST TO SAY SO,

16:33.433 --> 16:39.866
THAN I, JOHN McWHORTER, M A

16:39.933 --> 16:42.600
WHITE SUPREMACIST AND YOU COULD

16:42.666 --> 16:45.600
PUT US ON TWITTER BECAUSE I

16:45.666 --> 16:46.166
EMBRACE DEGREE AND NUANCE.

16:46.233 --> 16:57.366
>>>> Bill: OTHER THING ABOUT

16:57.433 --> 16:59.500
RACE THAT WHITE PEOPLE CAN'T

16:59.566 --> 17:00.266
TALK TO.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.366
>> YOU DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE >>

17:02.433 --> 17:03.433
Bill: >> Bill: IT DOESN'T

17:03.500 --> 17:05.133
ROB ME OF BEING ASANTE AND THE

17:05.200 --> 17:05.766
PERSON BEING WHITE.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.400
>> YOU CAN SAY NOTHING, THAT

17:07.466 --> 17:08.600
MAKES ME FEEL GOOD BECAUSE THAT

17:08.666 --> 17:09.800
MEANS I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS

17:09.866 --> 17:11.333
TO TALK, HE COULD SEE WHERE THAT

17:11.400 --> 17:12.966
COMES FROM BECAUSE YOU GET TO

17:13.033 --> 17:14.333
EXPRESS YOURSELF AND YOU GET TO

17:14.400 --> 17:17.966
NEVER BE TOLD YOU'RE WRONG.

17:18.033 --> 17:19.000
IT'S CHILDISH AND IT'S SAD

17:19.066 --> 17:20.400
ENOUGH WHEN A BLACK PERSON SAYS

17:20.466 --> 17:21.566
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO

17:21.633 --> 17:23.566
GO BUT THEN WHEN A WHITE PERSON

17:23.633 --> 17:25.233
SAYS THAT'S PROGRESS, THAT'S

17:25.300 --> 17:25.900
ENLIGHTENMENT TO PRETEND A WHITE

17:25.966 --> 17:30.000
PERSON HAS NOTHING TO SAY, THAT

17:30.066 --> 17:31.200
DIALOGUE WILL NEVER ADVANCE

17:31.266 --> 17:32.233
ANYTHING.

17:32.300 --> 17:32.933
TALK ABOUT NOT UNDERSTANDING

17:33.000 --> 17:34.333
HISTORY, ALL OF THAT IS A LOT OF

17:34.400 --> 17:36.166
FUN IN THE PRESENT, IT MAKES FOR

17:36.233 --> 17:37.900
A GREAT TWITTER AND CATHARTIC

17:37.966 --> 17:39.066
DISCUSSIONS BUT NOTHING WILL

17:39.133 --> 17:39.366
EVER CHANGE.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.333
WHEN YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY

17:42.400 --> 17:43.966
CAN'T TALK, WHAT THEY WILL DO IS

17:44.033 --> 17:44.766
THINK AND GET ANGRY, YOU DON'T

17:44.833 --> 17:46.366
GET RID OF WHAT THEY ARE

17:46.433 --> 17:55.200
THINKING SO YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE.

17:55.266 --> 17:58.133
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

17:58.200 --> 17:58.733
>> Bill: YOU'VE MENTIONED

17:58.800 --> 18:01.766
TWITTER, I'VE GOT TO GO BACK TO

18:01.833 --> 18:02.433
THAT FOR A SECOND AS

18:02.500 --> 18:03.666
DISAPPOINTED AS I AM IN THE

18:03.733 --> 18:06.533
LIBERAL HALF OF AMERICA FOR NOT

18:06.600 --> 18:07.933
STANDING UP TO TWITTER, IF YOU

18:08.000 --> 18:10.233
LIKE TWITTER HAS COMPLETELY MADE

18:10.300 --> 18:17.333
LIBERALS TH THERE BITCH.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.500
YOU LOOK AT THE OSCARS, THE

18:19.566 --> 18:20.933
OSCARS WAS A SHOW COMPLETELY

18:21.000 --> 18:22.100
ORGANIZED AROUND THE PRINCIPLE

18:22.166 --> 18:24.200
"DON'T DO ANYTHING TO MAKE

18:24.266 --> 18:25.566
TWITTER MAD."

18:25.633 --> 18:28.533
AND THEY STILL DID BY NOT GIVING

18:28.600 --> 18:28.900
THE OSCAR --

18:28.966 --> 18:30.600
>> THIS IS A SCARY TIME IN THAT

18:30.666 --> 18:32.733
WAY BECAUSE IT'S THE WEIRDEST

18:32.800 --> 18:33.833
THING ABOUT SOCIAL HISTORY AND

18:33.900 --> 18:36.400
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHY IT'S

18:36.466 --> 18:36.833
COMPLICATED.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.300
IN THE 70s AND 80s, THINKING

18:39.366 --> 18:40.333
AMERICA AND BEYOND IT LEARNS TO

18:40.400 --> 18:43.166
BE A RACIST IS A TERRIBLE THING,

18:43.233 --> 18:44.733
EVERYONE THINKS TO BE A RACIST

18:44.800 --> 18:47.500
IS ALMOST AS BAD AS BEING A

18:47.566 --> 18:50.700
PEDOPHILE AND THAT'S GREAT, MOST

18:50.766 --> 18:51.766
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT'S

18:51.833 --> 18:53.400
UNPRECEDENTED IN THE WHOLE

18:53.466 --> 18:54.733
300,000 YEAR HISTORY OF THE

18:54.800 --> 18:55.633
SPECIES OF THE SOCIETY WOULD

18:55.700 --> 18:57.733
COME TO THAT REALIZATION, THEN

18:57.800 --> 18:59.266
SOCIAL MEDIA COMES ALONG AND YOU

18:59.333 --> 19:00.633
CAN SHAME PEOPLE, YOU HAVE A

19:00.700 --> 19:01.666
WHOLE GROUP OF PEOPLE IT'S NOT

19:01.733 --> 19:03.666
JUST WOKE PEOPLE, I DON'T HAVE A

19:03.733 --> 19:05.500
PROBLEM WITH WOKE, WOKE PEOPLE

19:05.566 --> 19:06.366
WHO ARE MEAN.

19:06.433 --> 19:07.400
THE WOKE PEOPLE WHO ARE MEAN IF

19:07.466 --> 19:09.000
YOU DON'T DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY

19:09.066 --> 19:10.833
PUT YOU ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THEY

19:10.900 --> 19:13.000
SAY "YOU'RE A RACIST."

19:13.066 --> 19:14.533
AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST OF

19:14.600 --> 19:16.733
US ARE DEATHLY AFRAID OF BEING

19:16.800 --> 19:18.366
CALLED A RACIST ON TWITTER.

19:18.433 --> 19:19.766
YOU HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO

19:19.833 --> 19:21.900
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING YOU AND I

19:21.966 --> 19:23.366
ARE SAYING -- THIS IS INDELICATE

19:23.433 --> 19:24.766
BUT I CAN THINK OF ANOTHER

19:24.833 --> 19:25.566
IMAGE, EVERYBODY IS PEEING IN

19:25.633 --> 19:29.600
THEIR PANTS.

19:29.666 --> 19:31.466
THIS IS A NATION ESPECIALLY

19:31.533 --> 19:32.166
SINCE LAST SUMMER HAS SMELLED

19:32.233 --> 19:33.600
LIKE YOU'RE IN ALL THE TIME,

19:33.666 --> 19:39.200
THERE IS SO MUCH MENDACITY.

19:39.266 --> 19:40.166
[LAUGHTER]

19:40.233 --> 19:40.433
[APPLAUSE]

19:40.500 --> 19:41.633
>> Bill: AS SOMEONE WHO HAS

19:41.700 --> 19:43.333
LIVED THROUGH A FEW DECADES NOW

19:43.400 --> 19:44.266
I SEE THIS AS SO

19:44.333 --> 19:46.366
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, AS SO

19:46.433 --> 19:49.600
DIFFERENT THAN THE WAY IT WAS

19:49.666 --> 19:53.466
TEN YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, I

19:53.533 --> 19:55.766
FEEL LIKE RACE RELATIONSHIPS

19:55.833 --> 19:56.400
WERE BETTER BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE

19:56.466 --> 19:58.900
INTERMARRYING MORE, MIXING MORE,

19:58.966 --> 20:01.333
THOSE TABOOS WENT AWAY, JOKING

20:01.400 --> 20:04.166
WITH EACH OTHER MORE.

20:04.233 --> 20:05.233
HOW DO PEOPLE BOND?

20:05.300 --> 20:08.300
THEY JOKE, THEY TALK, AND NOW WE

20:08.366 --> 20:10.066
ARE ALL ON EGG SHELLS.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.600
WHO MAKES A JOKE?

20:12.666 --> 20:14.533
>> IT'S DIFFICULT, ONE IS AFRAID

20:14.600 --> 20:16.800
TO DO IT IN CERTAIN PLACES AND

20:16.866 --> 20:18.000
IT'S ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

20:18.066 --> 20:21.700
IT'S SCARY, IT'S ODD TO.

20:21.766 --> 20:23.533
PEOPLE SAY "HE'S CONSERVATIVE."

20:23.600 --> 20:25.633
NO, BUT I AM BEGINNING TO THINK

20:25.700 --> 20:28.466
I MISS 2004, 2005 BECAUSE RACE

20:28.533 --> 20:29.833
RELATIONS WERE DIFFICULT THEN, I

20:29.900 --> 20:30.866
WAS ALREADY WRITING ABOUT THEM

20:30.933 --> 20:32.633
THEN, IT WAS AT LEAST A LITTLE

20:32.700 --> 20:34.166
MORE HONEST AND A LITTLE MORE

20:34.233 --> 20:35.233
PROGRESSIVE THAN WHAT HAS

20:35.300 --> 20:37.833
HAPPENED ESPECIALLY SINCE LAST

20:37.900 --> 20:39.333
SUMMER, A LOT OF IT STARTED

20:39.400 --> 20:40.766
CREEPING IN AROUND 2014.

20:40.833 --> 20:41.833
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS GONE

20:41.900 --> 20:43.400
REALLY WRONG AND I THINK THE

20:43.466 --> 20:44.466
CATALYST IS THIS WEIRD THING

20:44.533 --> 20:45.366
CALLED SOCIAL MEDIA.

20:45.433 --> 20:47.533
IT USED TO BE IF YOU SAID

20:47.600 --> 20:48.433
SOMETHING TERRIBLE PEOPLE WOULD

20:48.500 --> 20:51.400
WRITE ABOUT IT IN ARTICLES.

20:51.466 --> 20:53.100
PEOPLE WOULD SEND YOU NASTY

20:53.166 --> 20:54.933
MAIL, IT WOULD BE DISCUSSED BUT

20:55.000 --> 20:56.533
THERE WAS NO TWITTER IT COULD BE

20:56.600 --> 20:58.766
DISCUSSED AND YOU CAN HAVE

20:58.833 --> 21:00.733
PEOPLE DOG PILING.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.133
ONCE YOU'VE GOTTEN THAT DEVICE

21:02.200 --> 21:02.900
WHERE YOU ARE BEING CALLED

21:02.966 --> 21:03.666
SOMETHING ON THIS THING EVERYONE

21:03.733 --> 21:05.533
HAS ON THEIR PHONE, THAT'S

21:05.600 --> 21:07.000
WONDERFUL IN MANY WAYS -- I'M AS

21:07.066 --> 21:08.200
ADDICTED TO THIS AS ANYBODY ELSE

21:08.266 --> 21:09.900
BUT IT MEANS YOU CAN BE

21:09.966 --> 21:11.200
SERIOUSLY HURT IN A WAY YOU

21:11.266 --> 21:12.866
COULDN'T BEFORE.

21:12.933 --> 21:14.566
I USED TO GET HATE MAIL IN AN

21:14.633 --> 21:16.566
ENVELOPE AND I WOULD OPEN IT AND

21:16.633 --> 21:17.666
READ.

21:17.733 --> 21:18.400
"YOU SUCK."

21:18.466 --> 21:19.700
AND ONLY I KNEW AND I WOULD

21:19.766 --> 21:21.133
THROW IT IN THE TRASH, NO YOU

21:21.200 --> 21:22.200
DON'T GET THOSE ANYMORE BECAUSE

21:22.266 --> 21:23.633
IT'S ON TWITTER.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.466
IT WILL SAY YOU SUCK AND YOU

21:24.533 --> 21:26.100
SAID YOU WERE A WHITE SUPREMACY

21:26.166 --> 21:26.833
IS ON TV AND EVERYBODY SEES IT

21:26.900 --> 21:29.166
AND IT GETS LIKED BY 10,000

21:29.233 --> 21:30.900
PEOPLE, THAT'S HARD FOR MOST

21:30.966 --> 21:31.666
PEOPLE UNLESS YOU ARE WEIRD LIKE

21:31.733 --> 21:33.666
US AND YOU DON'T MIND BEING

21:33.733 --> 21:34.000
HATED.

21:34.066 --> 21:35.033
BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO

21:35.100 --> 21:36.766
HAVE THAT DISEASE.

21:36.833 --> 21:40.900
SO WE ARE STUCK WHERE WE ARE.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.366
>> Bill: KEEP FIGHTING THE

21:43.433 --> 21:43.666
GOOD FIGHT.

21:43.733 --> 21:44.800
I KNOW IT TAKES A LOT TO GET YOU

21:44.866 --> 21:46.700
OUT OF YOUR READING CHAIR AND

21:46.766 --> 21:49.966
YOUR PROFESSORSHIP, AND VERY

21:50.033 --> 21:50.866
APPRECIATE IF YOU CAME OUT HERE

21:50.933 --> 21:53.000
TO DO THIS FOR US AND I HOPE YOU

21:53.066 --> 21:53.566
COME BACK.

21:53.633 --> 21:56.233
>> I SHOULD ALSO SAY VERY

21:56.300 --> 22:00.766
QUICKLY, NINE NASTY WORDS IS A

22:00.833 --> 22:04.700
BOOK VERY RECENTLY, I LAUGH

22:04.766 --> 22:05.500
SOMETIMES, IT WAS WRITTEN TO BE

22:05.566 --> 22:07.666
A GOOD TIME.

22:07.733 --> 22:10.300
I WROTE THAT, SO I CAN ALSO BE

22:10.366 --> 22:11.300
FUNNY.

22:11.366 --> 22:12.566
>> Bill: IT'S A GREAT BOOK,

22:12.633 --> 22:15.866
YOU ARE A PROFESSOR.

22:15.933 --> 22:16.733
THANK YOU JOHN.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.000
CONGRESSWOMAN WHO REPRESENTS

MICHIGAN'S 8TH DISTRICT:

REPRESENTATIVE ELISSA SLOTKIN.

22:42.566 --> 22:45.900
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

22:45.966 --> 22:47.866

22:55.933 --> 22:59.233
MOSTLY FOR LOADING AND

22:59.300 --> 22:59.500
UNLOADING.

22:59.566 --> 23:01.033
I JUST WANT TO SAY YOU LOOK

23:01.100 --> 23:02.966
AROUND THE WORLD, SOME COUNTRIES

23:03.033 --> 23:04.333

23:04.400 --> 23:06.266
AND SOME COUNTRIES LIKE ISRAEL

23:06.333 --> 23:09.333
HAVE KILLED IT, ALMOST NO DEATHS

23:09.400 --> 23:10.000
IN THE WEEK NOW.

23:10.066 --> 23:14.666
WE ARE LOOKING MORE LIKE ISRAEL

23:14.733 --> 23:16.866
THAN INDIA, AMERICA, WHO

23:16.933 --> 23:19.566
WOULD'VE THOUGHT?

23:19.633 --> 23:20.533
BIDEN HAS ONLY BEEN IN OFFICE

23:20.600 --> 23:24.900
FIVE MONTHS.

23:24.966 --> 23:26.833
OF WHAT DOES THIS REMIND ME OF

23:26.900 --> 23:28.133
ONE THING WERE GOING COMPLETELY

23:28.200 --> 23:32.133
TO SHIT AND THEN A DEMOCRAT GOT

23:32.200 --> 23:35.166
ELECTED, OH, YEAH!

23:35.233 --> 23:36.400
2009, THE ECONOMY WAS COMPLETELY

23:36.466 --> 23:42.466
GOING INTO THE SHITTER AND NO

23:42.533 --> 23:44.100
DRAMA TOOK OFFICE AND MADE THE

23:44.166 --> 23:45.100
RIGHT CHOICES.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.733
IT SAVED THE AUTO INDUSTRY WHEN

23:47.800 --> 23:49.300
PEOPLE LIKE MITT ROMNEY SAID IN

23:49.366 --> 23:52.300
MICHIGAN -- PASSED A STIMULUS

23:52.366 --> 23:53.800
BILL THAT LOOKS PALTRY BY

23:53.866 --> 23:55.766
TODAY'S STANDARDS BUT DID THE

23:55.833 --> 24:00.233
JOB BECAUSE ONE PARTY I'M SORRY

24:00.300 --> 24:01.566
IS A POLICY PARTY.

24:01.633 --> 24:03.933
THEY ARE WALKS AND ONE PARTY IS

24:04.000 --> 24:05.600
TROLLS.

24:05.666 --> 24:09.300
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

24:09.366 --> 24:10.300
SPEAK OF THE PARTY I HELPED

24:10.366 --> 24:11.933
BUILD OVER 30 YEARS HAS BECOME A

24:12.000 --> 24:13.100
BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE

24:13.166 --> 24:14.500
TRANSGRESSIVE, THEY WANT TO GET

24:14.566 --> 24:16.166
OUT AND SWING THEIR DICK'S

24:16.233 --> 24:17.700
AROUND AND HAVE PEOPLE YELL NUMB

24:17.766 --> 24:19.166
AND SCREAM AT YOUR CANCELING ME

24:19.233 --> 24:20.300
FOR BURNING THE HOUSE DOWN, THEY

24:20.366 --> 24:21.933
ARE BURNING THE HOUSE DOWN FOR

24:22.000 --> 24:22.500
THE MOST PART.

24:22.566 --> 24:24.200
JOE BIDEN IS DOING A GOOD JOB IN

24:24.266 --> 24:25.400
PART BECAUSE HE DOESN'T GET UP

24:25.466 --> 24:26.333
EVERY MORNING AND THINK HOW MY

24:26.400 --> 24:28.566
GOING TO SET THE WORLD ON FIRE

24:28.633 --> 24:33.700
BY TWEETING SOME CRAZY SHIT?

24:33.766 --> 24:35.333
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

24:35.400 --> 24:37.400
>> AND CAN I JUST SAY I MISS

24:37.466 --> 24:39.600
THIS IDEA THAT WE CAN HAVE AN

24:39.666 --> 24:41.000
IDEOLOGICAL DEBATE BETWEEN TWO

24:41.066 --> 24:41.366
HEALTHY PARTIES.

24:41.433 --> 24:43.200
THAT IS A GOOD THING, WE SHOULD

24:43.266 --> 24:45.933
WANT A STRONG TWO PARTY SYSTEM.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.833
RIGHT NOW I'M MISSING WHAT THE

24:47.900 --> 24:49.966
IDEOLOGICAL CENTER IS OF THE

24:50.033 --> 24:50.166
PARTY.

24:50.233 --> 24:51.766
>> Bill: WE NEED IT.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.700
>> THERE IS NO CENTER, IT'S ALL

24:53.766 --> 24:55.100
TRUMPED COME ALL THE TIME.

24:55.166 --> 24:58.266
>> I MISS THAT, I THINK THERE'S

24:58.333 --> 24:59.466
REPUBLICANS I REPRESENT A LOT OF

24:59.533 --> 25:00.900
THEM, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A

25:00.966 --> 25:01.100
HOME.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.366
>> Bill: IT'S NOT LIKE

25:02.433 --> 25:03.366
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T USED TO KNOW

25:03.433 --> 25:08.400
HOW TO DO THIS, GE GEORGE BUSH E

25:08.466 --> 25:09.900
FIRST, I WASN'T INTO THEIR

25:09.966 --> 25:11.533
POLITICS BUT THEY WERE PRAGMATIC

25:11.600 --> 25:12.800
PEOPLE WHO HANDLED PROBLEMS, THE

25:12.866 --> 25:14.366
BERLIN WALL FELL, THEY HANDLED

25:14.433 --> 25:15.900
IT IN A GOOD WAY.

25:15.966 --> 25:17.133
LIZ CHENEY, LET'S TALK ABOUT

25:17.200 --> 25:18.433
THIS.

25:18.500 --> 25:21.466
52% OF REPUBLICANS IN WYOMING,

25:21.533 --> 25:24.033
HER STATE, WYOMING HAS LIKE NINE

25:24.100 --> 25:27.166
PEOPLE IN IT.

25:27.233 --> 25:28.700
52% OF THEM SAY THEY WILL NOT

25:28.766 --> 25:30.500
VOTE FOR HER IN THE PRIMARY NO

25:30.566 --> 25:32.333
MATTER WHO RUNS AGAINST HER

25:32.400 --> 25:35.133
BECAUSE -- I FEEL LIKE THIS IS

25:35.200 --> 25:36.733
THE PROBLEM.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.666
IT'S NOT EVEN THE MAIN

25:38.733 --> 25:39.266
REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S LIKE IN

25:39.333 --> 25:43.266
THE STATE LEVEL, IT'S GETTING

25:43.333 --> 25:46.766
PRIMARY IT, IT'S THE ACTIVISTS.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.233
SHE IS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF

25:49.300 --> 25:51.833
REALITY, SHE'S PRO REALITY.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.100
ONE GUY WHO IS NOT OUR TEAM WON

25:54.166 --> 25:55.033
THE ELECTION AND THEY ARE NOT

25:55.100 --> 25:57.100
PRO REALITY.

25:57.166 --> 26:00.566
SO SHE HAS GOT TO GO.

26:00.633 --> 26:02.133
>> SHE REPRESENTS SOMETHING SO

26:02.200 --> 26:03.766
DANGEROUS TO THEM BECAUSE TO BE

26:03.833 --> 26:05.033
A SUPPORTER OF THE REPUBLICAN

26:05.100 --> 26:06.966
PARTY YOU ARE ALL IN ON THE MYTH

26:07.033 --> 26:08.266
THAT TRUMPED WON THE ELECTION,

26:08.333 --> 26:10.466
YOU ARE IN ON THE LIES AND

26:10.533 --> 26:12.133
SUPPORT YOU HAVE TO BUILD A

26:12.200 --> 26:13.800
SCAFFOLDING OF LIES EVERY DAY

26:13.866 --> 26:14.600
THE PYRAMID OF BULLSHIT HAS TO

26:14.666 --> 26:15.966
GET TALLER AND YOU HAVE TO SAY

26:16.033 --> 26:16.633
THAT WAS ALWAYS THE CASE AND SHE

26:16.700 --> 26:19.133
WON'T DO IT.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.766
SHE JUST WON'T DO IT.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.900
AS SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE

26:22.966 --> 26:24.466
CHENEY'S, THESE PEOPLE, THEY

26:24.533 --> 26:25.633
DON'T FUCK AROUND, THEY ARE

26:25.700 --> 26:26.733
SERIOUS PEOPLE, WHETHER YOU LOVE

26:26.800 --> 26:28.566
THEM OR HATE THEM THEY ARE

26:28.633 --> 26:30.066
SERIOUS PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

26:30.133 --> 26:30.300
REALITY.

26:30.366 --> 26:32.333
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, SHE IS

26:32.400 --> 26:33.300
GOING TO LOSE HER CONFERENCE

26:33.366 --> 26:35.366
CHAIR -- THAT'S NOT ABOUT HER.

26:35.433 --> 26:36.900
>> Bill: SHE'S GOING TO LOOSE

26:36.966 --> 26:37.500
HER SEAT.

26:37.566 --> 26:40.100
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT HER, SHE'S NOT

26:40.166 --> 26:41.533
WILLING TO SWALLOW THE POISON

26:41.600 --> 26:43.133
AND SAY IT TASTES LIKE KOOL-AID,

26:43.200 --> 26:44.966
IT'S NOT, IT IS KILLING THIS

26:45.033 --> 26:47.133
PARTY, IT IS KILLING THIS

26:47.200 --> 26:47.366
COUNTRY.

26:47.433 --> 26:52.400
IF WE ALLOW THIS MYTH OF TRUMPS

26:52.466 --> 26:53.166
ALLEGED VICTORY WITH BAMBOO

26:53.233 --> 26:54.566
FIBERS AND WHATEVER FICTIONAL

26:54.633 --> 26:55.500
HORSE SHIPPED THEY ARE GOING TO

26:55.566 --> 26:56.833
PULL OUT TODAY --

26:56.900 --> 26:59.933
[APPLAUSE]

27:00.000 --> 27:01.100
SHE REPRESENTS SOMETHING THAT IS

27:01.166 --> 27:03.933
OF VANISHING SPECIES, IT'S LIKE

27:04.000 --> 27:06.800
WATCHING THE LAST WOOLLY MAMMOTH

27:06.866 --> 27:08.300
WANDERING THE TAIGA.

27:08.366 --> 27:10.500
THOSE REPUBLICANS AREN'T GOING

27:10.566 --> 27:10.933
TO SURVIVE.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.166
>> Bill: I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE

27:12.233 --> 27:13.500
CASE BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS,

27:13.566 --> 27:16.900
TO A REPUBLICAN.

27:16.966 --> 27:17.166
>> FORMER.

27:17.233 --> 27:18.966
>> Bill: YOU'RE NOT A

27:19.033 --> 27:19.400
REPUBLICAN ANYMORE?

27:19.466 --> 27:21.366
>> I'M A REGISTERED INDEPENDENT.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.566
I VOTED AGAINST TRUMP AND THE

27:23.633 --> 27:24.766
PRIMARY AND THE GENERAL AND IN

27:24.833 --> 27:26.400
THE LAST ELECTION I HAD TO BE

27:26.466 --> 27:29.133
ABLE TO VOTE AGAINST THAT FUCKER

27:29.200 --> 27:29.333
TWICE.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.000
THEN I REREGISTERED.

27:32.066 --> 27:35.233
>> Bill: BUT THAT'S TRUMP,

27:35.300 --> 27:36.766
YOU'RE TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO

27:36.833 --> 27:38.066
WAS VERY HARD ON GEORGE BUSH AND

27:38.133 --> 27:40.233
MITT ROMNEY AND ALL THE

27:40.300 --> 27:40.966
REPUBLICANS OVER THE YEARS,

27:41.033 --> 27:42.533
BASICALLY BUT I'VE COME TO

27:42.600 --> 27:44.500
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE LIKE LIZ

27:44.566 --> 27:45.100
CHENEY AND GEORGE BUSH AND

27:45.166 --> 27:47.300
MITT ROMNEY AND MIKE PENCE WHO

27:47.366 --> 27:48.800
COULD HAVE DONE THE WRONG THING

27:48.866 --> 27:54.233
THAT JANUARY 6 DAY, HE DIDN'T.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.066
THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS AS I

27:56.133 --> 27:59.166
WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO MY

27:59.233 --> 28:02.166
DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS, FOR A

28:02.233 --> 28:02.466
REPUBLICAN.

28:02.533 --> 28:03.500
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD

28:03.566 --> 28:04.133
WHO JUST DON'T SEE THE WORLD THE

28:04.200 --> 28:07.033
WAY YOU DO, THEY JUST DON'T.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.566
IT'S A CHIP IN OUR BRAIN.

28:08.633 --> 28:11.400
YOU CAN'T EXPECT, I WAS ALWAYS

28:11.466 --> 28:15.266
SAYING WHAT IS THE SAFE WORD FOR

28:15.333 --> 28:16.366
REPUBLICANS WHEN TRUMP WAS

28:16.433 --> 28:18.500
PRESIDENT, WHAT IS THE ONE THING

28:18.566 --> 28:19.633
WHERE HE WILL DRAW THE LINE

28:19.700 --> 28:22.100
WHERE THEY WILL SAY OKAY,

28:22.166 --> 28:24.266
STOP -- SOME OF THEM DID HAVE

28:24.333 --> 28:24.566
IT.

28:24.633 --> 28:25.800
LIZ CHENEY HAD IT, MIKE PENCE

28:25.866 --> 28:34.000
HADDAD, MET ROMN ROMNEY HAD IT,U

28:34.066 --> 28:36.733
HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.233
YOU CAN'T HATE THE MITT ROMNEY,

28:39.300 --> 28:42.400
CHENEY, GEORGE BUSH, YOU HEAR

28:42.466 --> 28:43.666
LIBERAL PEOPLE SAY I HATE THEM,

28:43.733 --> 28:46.766
I WANT THEM TO DIE, THAT'S

28:46.833 --> 28:49.133
GREAT, BUT THEY OWN SELF

28:49.200 --> 28:49.400
REPORTING.

28:49.466 --> 28:50.200
>> Bill: I DON'T THINK IT

28:50.266 --> 28:51.333
HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE

28:51.400 --> 28:52.766
LEFT TO SUBMIT ROMNEY'S EXEC

28:52.833 --> 28:54.800
LIKE DONALD TRUMP, NO HE'S NOT.

28:54.866 --> 28:57.533
HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE CATEGORY.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.233
>> THERE HAS TO BE A DISTINCTION

28:59.300 --> 29:00.900
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOTALLY

29:00.966 --> 29:02.400
DIFFERENT VIEWS THAN YOU AND

29:02.466 --> 29:04.733
PEOPLE WHO ARE FUNDAMENTALLY NOT

29:04.800 --> 29:05.900
ACCEPTING OF DEMOCRACY WHO ARE

29:05.966 --> 29:08.333
TRYING TO UNDO DEMOCRACY.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.766
THAT IS DIFFERENT, THAT'S MY

29:10.833 --> 29:11.433
LINE.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.233
>> Bill: THAT'S WHERE THESE

29:14.300 --> 29:22.166
PEOPLE, CHENEY AND BUSH, THEY

29:22.233 --> 29:23.566
WOULD NOT BEND THE KNEE.

29:23.633 --> 29:24.733
>> YOU DON'T GET TO CHANGE THE

29:24.800 --> 29:25.633
RULES OF THE GAME IN THE MIDDLE

29:25.700 --> 29:26.800
OF THE GAME BECAUSE YOU THINK

29:26.866 --> 29:27.566
YOU'RE LOSING, THAT'S WHAT THEY

29:27.633 --> 29:28.666
ARE TRYING TO DO AT THE STATE

29:28.733 --> 29:30.166
LEVEL IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL, WE

29:30.233 --> 29:32.233
HAVE TO DRAW A BRIGHT RED LINE

29:32.300 --> 29:34.800
BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO MAY BE FISCAL

29:34.866 --> 29:35.633
CONSERVATIVES FOR SOCIAL

29:35.700 --> 29:36.833
CONSERVATIVES, PEOPLE LIKE MY

29:36.900 --> 29:39.000
IN-LAWS WHO I LOVE DEEPLY WHO

29:39.066 --> 29:40.233
WILL NEVER BELIEVE IN DESTROYING

29:40.300 --> 29:43.066
THE DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WE ALL

29:43.133 --> 29:44.666
LOVE, NEVER.

29:44.733 --> 29:48.733
>> Bill: IN-LAWS?

29:48.800 --> 29:50.500
IT'S AN ISSUE IN A LOT OF

29:50.566 --> 29:52.833
HOUSEHOLDS, IN-LAWS, I'M

29:52.900 --> 29:55.166
IMAGINING.

29:55.233 --> 29:56.500
IT'S AN INTERESTING POLL THIS

29:56.566 --> 29:58.100
WEEK, SOMETIMES I THINK TRUMP IS

29:58.166 --> 29:59.966
NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY, I ALWAYS

30:00.033 --> 30:01.500
CALL HIM THE SHARK THAT'S OUT TO

30:01.566 --> 30:03.966
SEE, HE'S COMING BACK, WE NEED A

30:04.033 --> 30:06.066
BIGGER BOAT -- BUT THIS WEEK,

30:06.133 --> 30:08.466
THIS IS A POLL THEY HAVE DONE A

30:08.533 --> 30:09.533
NUMBER OF TIMES.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.633
REPUBLICANS: HOW MANY SUPPORT

30:10.700 --> 30:11.766
THE PARTY AND THEIR POLICIES

30:11.833 --> 30:14.333
MORE THAN TRUMP?

30:14.400 --> 30:17.066
FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT IS A

30:17.133 --> 30:21.066
MAJORITY, 50% SUPPORT THE THE

30:21.133 --> 30:22.566
PARTY MORE THAN TRUMP, THE

30:22.633 --> 30:23.800
LEGACY THAT TRUMP LEFT US THE

30:23.866 --> 30:25.166
BIG LIE ABOUT THE ELECTION THAT

30:25.233 --> 30:26.433
LIVES ON.

30:26.500 --> 30:30.200
AT 70% REPUBLICANS THINK THAT

30:30.266 --> 30:31.866
BIDEN IS BASICALLY AN

30:31.933 --> 30:32.566
ILLEGITIMATE PRESIDENT BECAUSE

30:32.633 --> 30:36.633
HE DIDN'T GET ENOUGH VOTES.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.100
>> IT'S A COMPLICATED THING

30:38.166 --> 30:39.900
ABOUT ELECTIONS, YOU HAVE TO GET

30:39.966 --> 30:40.200
MORE VOTES.

30:40.266 --> 30:47.533
IT'S A WEIRD RULE.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.633
>> Bill: IS IT POSSIBLE TRUMP

30:49.700 --> 30:53.100
IS FADING?

30:53.166 --> 30:54.866
THE LIE IS FADING, DO THEY WANT

30:54.933 --> 30:58.333
HIM AS THE FACE OF THE MIDTERMS?

30:58.400 --> 30:59.533
IS IT POSSIBLE THERE ARE

30:59.600 --> 31:00.733
REPUBLICANS OUT THERE A LOT OF

31:00.800 --> 31:01.500
THEM WHO ARE LIKE HE'S A LOSER,

31:01.566 --> 31:05.866
HE DID LOSE.

31:05.933 --> 31:06.300
[APPLAUSE]

31:06.366 --> 31:08.500
IT'S A LOT OF BAGGAGE, IT'S A

31:08.566 --> 31:09.500
LOT OF DRAMA.

31:09.566 --> 31:10.766
NOW THAT WE'VE SEEN SIX MONTHS

31:10.833 --> 31:12.900
WITHOUT THE TWEETS IN THE MEAN

31:12.966 --> 31:14.566
GIRL SHIT AND THE CRAZINESS AND

31:14.633 --> 31:17.733
THE REDRAWING WEATHER MAPS,

31:17.800 --> 31:18.866
MAYBE THEY LOVE THIS NEW BOY

31:18.933 --> 31:23.300
RON DeSANTIS IN FLORIDA.

31:23.366 --> 31:25.533
IF RON DeSANTIS RAN AGAINST

31:25.600 --> 31:28.533
TRUMP NOW, HE'S HARVARD, HE'S

31:28.600 --> 31:33.066
GAIL, NAVY -- AGAIN, NOT MY

31:33.133 --> 31:35.966
POLITICS BUT IF HE RAN AGAINST

31:36.033 --> 31:37.000
TRUMP AND THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE

31:37.066 --> 31:38.000
IN THE WINGS, THEY DON'T WANT TO

31:38.066 --> 31:40.100
WAIT FOR TRUMP BECAUSE HE WILL

31:40.166 --> 31:44.033
LIVE TO A MILLION.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.166
HE'S A COMPLETED CITY ROACH,

31:45.233 --> 31:47.800
NOTHING CAN KILL HIM.

31:47.866 --> 31:48.066
[LAUGHTER]

31:48.133 --> 31:51.533
[APPLAUSE]

31:51.600 --> 31:52.833
COVID COULDN'T TAKE THEM OUT,

31:52.900 --> 31:54.700
THE WORST DIET IN THE WORLD,

31:54.766 --> 31:55.133
DOESN'T MATTER.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.133
IF HE'S GOING TO BE THERE

31:57.200 --> 31:57.366
FOREVER.

31:57.433 --> 31:59.200
I DON'T KNOW IF RON DeSANTIS

31:59.266 --> 32:01.333
WANTS TO WAIT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S

32:01.400 --> 32:01.833
BLESSING AND I WONDER IF

32:01.900 --> 32:04.133
REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TRUMP

32:04.200 --> 32:05.800
WITHOUT HIM.

32:05.866 --> 32:09.533
>> THEY WANT TRUMP, THESE ARE MY

32:09.600 --> 32:12.066
FORMER PEOPLE AND I KNOW THE

32:12.133 --> 32:12.800
TRIBE.

32:12.866 --> 32:14.000
ESPECIALLY DOWN AT THE

32:14.066 --> 32:17.833
GRASSROOTS LEVEL -- THEY MAY

32:17.900 --> 32:19.300
LOOK AT RON DeSANTIS AND THINK

32:19.366 --> 32:20.733
HE CAN BE SOMEWHAT ACCEPTABLE

32:20.800 --> 32:22.900
BUT THE MINUTE HE GOES TO IOWA

32:22.966 --> 32:23.400
OR NEW HAMPSHIRE OR

32:23.466 --> 32:25.300
SOUTH CAROLINA AND TRUMP SEES IT

32:25.366 --> 32:27.266
ON FOX AND LOSES HIS SHIT AND

32:27.333 --> 32:28.933
SAYS "WEAK LOSER RON DeSANTIS,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.766
HE SHOULD BE HATED, HE'S NOT A

32:31.833 --> 32:33.933
TOUGH MANLY MAN LIKE ME."

32:34.000 --> 32:41.133
IT WILL DESTROY THE GUYS CAREER.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.600
IF DONALD TRUMP IS NOT EATEN BY

32:42.666 --> 32:44.100
AN ALLIGATOR, HE IS THE

32:44.166 --> 32:48.466
PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE FOR 24.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.000
>> NOT ONLY IS HE WAITING AND

32:50.066 --> 32:52.033
FIGURING IT OUT IN THE WINGS,

32:52.100 --> 32:53.366
THE STYLE OF POLITICS THAT HE

32:53.433 --> 32:54.800
MAINSTREAMED IS ALIVE AND WELL

32:54.866 --> 32:57.166
CERTAINLY AT HOME WHERE I AM.

32:57.233 --> 33:00.100
IT'S BASICALLY NO FACTS, NO

33:00.166 --> 33:00.500
TRUTH, NO SHAME.

33:00.566 --> 33:03.500
YOU CAN DO SO MUCH IF YOU DON'T

33:03.566 --> 33:03.866
HAVE ANY SHAPE.

33:03.933 --> 33:05.266
IF YOU DON'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE

33:05.333 --> 33:06.766
SAY ABOUT YOU, IF YOU DON'T CARE

33:06.833 --> 33:09.366
THEY CATCH YOU IN A LIVE, IT'S

33:09.433 --> 33:10.566
AMAZING WHAT YOU COULD DO AS A

33:10.633 --> 33:10.866
POLITICIAN.

33:10.933 --> 33:12.900
I THINK THAT STYLE I SEE A TON

33:12.966 --> 33:15.133
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO BE

33:15.200 --> 33:21.933
MTRUMP AT HOME IN MICHIGAN THEY

33:22.000 --> 33:24.100
THINK GREAT, POPULISM, NO SHAME

33:24.166 --> 33:26.900
IN MY, I'M IN.

33:26.966 --> 33:28.366
>> Bill: I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG

33:28.433 --> 33:29.933
ABOUT THAT BUT I WOULD NEVER BET

33:30.000 --> 33:32.033
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, YOU'RE

33:32.100 --> 33:32.433
RIGHT.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.933
THEY THREW HIM OFF FACEBOOK,

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
THIS WEEK FACEBOOK HAD AN

33:38.066 --> 33:43.366
OVERSIGHT BOARD --

33:43.433 --> 33:46.666
HOW BRAVE.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.733
[LAUGHTER]

33:47.800 --> 33:48.900
AN OVERSIGHT BOARD OF ACTIVISTS,

33:48.966 --> 33:51.233
LAWYERS, JOURNALISTS, EVERYONE

33:51.300 --> 33:56.000
KEEPS PASSING THIS HOT POTATO.

33:56.066 --> 33:57.200
HERE'S THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH.

33:57.266 --> 33:58.833
SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN THROWN OFF

33:58.900 --> 34:00.066
FACEBOOK AND TWITTER, THINGS GOT

34:00.133 --> 34:02.233
WAY BETTER IN THIS COUNTRY.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.300
IT DID THE ENORMOUS GOOD.

34:04.366 --> 34:08.366
[APPLAUSE]

34:08.433 --> 34:09.933
IT BRINGS UP ALL SORTS OF REALLY

34:10.000 --> 34:12.933
INCONVENIENT FREE-SPEECH ISSUES.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.666
THE BOARD, HOWEVER THESE PEOPLE

34:14.733 --> 34:16.966
ARE, THEY RULED THAT HE'S OFF

34:17.033 --> 34:17.566
FOR SIX MONTHS.

34:17.633 --> 34:21.133
FACEBOOK JAIL FOR SIX MONTHS

34:21.200 --> 34:22.100
BECAUSE HE CREATED AN

34:22.166 --> 34:24.533
ENVIRONMENT WHERE A SERIOUS RISK

34:24.600 --> 34:25.366
OF VIOLENCE WAS POSSIBLE -- YES,

34:25.433 --> 34:29.933
THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO --

34:30.000 --> 34:30.866
BUT I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT

34:30.933 --> 34:32.133
DOING THIS, I ALSO DON'T WANT

34:32.200 --> 34:33.500
FACEBOOK DOING THIS.

34:33.566 --> 34:39.100
[APPLAUSE]

34:39.166 --> 34:39.566
IT'S ONE OF THOSE --

34:39.633 --> 34:41.933
>> FACEBOOK'S POWER IN OUR

34:42.000 --> 34:43.133
SOCIETY HAS BECOME SO UNTETHERED

34:43.200 --> 34:46.333
AND IT IS SO VASTLY BEYOND WHAT

34:46.400 --> 34:47.033
ANYBODY COULD HAVE ANTICIPATED

34:47.100 --> 34:50.533
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.200
DONALD TRUMP HAS BENEFITED FROM

34:51.266 --> 34:52.066
BEING OFF TWITTER AND FACEBOOK,

34:52.133 --> 34:54.700
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

34:54.766 --> 34:56.333
IT'S LIKE THEY LOCKED THE LIQUOR

34:56.400 --> 34:57.200
CABINET AND THEY SLAPPED HIM IN

34:57.266 --> 35:00.733
A STRAITJACKET FOR SIX MONTHS.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.000
SO HIS MINIONS CAN REMEMBER THE

35:02.066 --> 35:04.466
GOOD THINGS AND NOT THE CRAZY

35:04.533 --> 35:06.666
TWEETS IN THE SHIT STORMS IN THE

35:06.733 --> 35:09.400
LATE NIGHT BULLSHIT.

35:09.466 --> 35:11.966
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS TRUMP

35:12.033 --> 35:14.533
WILL RUN, HE IS ADDICTED TO THAT

35:14.600 --> 35:16.533
SWEET, SWEET TWITTER SMACK, HE

35:16.600 --> 35:17.366
LOVES THAT STUFF.

35:17.433 --> 35:18.933
HE WILL RUN IN PART BECAUSE AS A

35:19.000 --> 35:20.766
CANDIDATE THEY WILL HAVE TO LET

35:20.833 --> 35:22.900
HIM BACK ON THE PLATFORMS.

35:22.966 --> 35:23.600
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOTIVATING

35:23.666 --> 35:26.500
FACTORS IN HIS HEAD.

35:26.566 --> 35:27.266
FACEBOOK IS AN OPEN SEWER OF

35:27.333 --> 35:30.333
PROPAGANDA AND INSANITY AND IF

35:30.400 --> 35:31.333
YOU SEEK OUT PROPAGANDA AND

35:31.400 --> 35:32.533
INSANITY YOU WILL GET MORE OF

35:32.600 --> 35:33.666
IT, THEY WILL SHOVEL IT INTO YOU

35:33.733 --> 35:34.266
AS FAST AS THEY CAN.

35:34.333 --> 35:38.733
THAT IS A SYSTEM -- GOVERNMENT

35:38.800 --> 35:39.833
CAN'T FIX IT BUT FACEBOOK IS NOT

35:39.900 --> 35:43.300
GOING TO FIX ITSELF IN THIS

35:43.366 --> 35:44.600
OVERSIGHT BOARD IS A CLOWN SHOW.

35:44.666 --> 35:46.733
>> Bill: I WISH THE BLUE

35:46.800 --> 35:48.600
RIBBON PANEL HAD MADE SOME NEW

35:48.666 --> 35:53.566
RULES, TO COIN A PHRASE --

35:53.633 --> 35:55.266
HERE'S THE THING.

35:55.333 --> 35:57.166
JUST THE BIG THINGS WE THROW YOU

35:57.233 --> 35:58.433
OFF FOR.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.666
LIKE SAYING "DEMOCRACY DOESN'T

35:59.733 --> 36:04.233
EXIST IN AMERICA ANYMORE."

36:04.300 --> 36:06.433
THINGS ALL REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN

36:06.500 --> 36:10.333
AGREE ON AND NOT MISSION CREEP.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.233
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.800
>> LET'S ESTABLISH THAT FACEBOOK

36:12.866 --> 36:14.900
HAS CREATED A BOARD SO THEY CAN

36:14.966 --> 36:16.666
PUNT TO SOMEBODY ELSE, THEY ARE

36:16.733 --> 36:17.533
A PRIVATE COMPANY.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.500
MARK ZUCKERBERG COULD PUT ON A

36:18.566 --> 36:20.466
POLICY TOMORROW IF YOU WANTED TO

36:20.533 --> 36:22.000
AFTER JANUARY 6 THEY FIGURED OUT

36:22.066 --> 36:24.566
THAT WAS PRETTY BAD OF US AND

36:24.633 --> 36:25.233
THEY SWUNG THE PENDULUM THE

36:25.300 --> 36:27.333
OTHER WAY.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.066
I THINK FOR ME ON FREE SPEECH IT

36:29.133 --> 36:31.466
IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE, YOU HAVE TO

36:31.533 --> 36:32.266
BE CAREFUL.

36:32.333 --> 36:33.900
THE THING I CAN SUPPORT WITH

36:33.966 --> 36:34.566
DONALD TRUMP STAYING OFF TWITTER

36:34.633 --> 36:36.900
IS THAT HE HAD BOTH THE CAPACITY

36:36.966 --> 36:39.466
TO GET THE HUGE NUMBERS OF

36:39.533 --> 36:40.366
PEOPLE AND HE OPENLY INCITED

36:40.433 --> 36:44.333
VIOLENCE.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.133
IF ANYONE WHO IS INCITED

36:45.200 --> 36:46.500
VIOLENCE SHOULD BE KICKED OFF,

36:46.566 --> 36:48.033
THAT IS WHERE YOUR FREE-SPEECH

36:48.100 --> 36:50.233
ENDS.

36:50.300 --> 36:50.466
ANYBODY.

36:50.533 --> 36:53.200
LEFT OR RIGHT.

36:53.266 --> 36:54.600
[APPLAUSE]

36:54.666 --> 36:57.566
>> Bill: THE TRUTH IS HE

36:57.633 --> 36:58.166
INCITED VIOLENCE NOT FROM THAT

36:58.233 --> 37:01.233
ONE THING HE SAID -- OF VIOLENCE

37:01.300 --> 37:03.100
WAS INCITED BY HIS ENTIRE TENURE

37:03.166 --> 37:05.366
IN OFFICE WHEN HE SAID IF I

37:05.433 --> 37:07.233
DON'T WIN IT'S A RIGGED

37:07.300 --> 37:09.100
ELECTION, THERE'S ONLY TWO

37:09.166 --> 37:11.633
OUTCOMES, I EITHER WIN OR IT'S A

37:11.700 --> 37:12.366
CHEAT.

37:12.433 --> 37:13.066
THAT'S WHAT INCITED THE

37:13.133 --> 37:13.700
VIOLENCE.

37:13.766 --> 37:15.566
WHAT IF SOMEBODY GETS ON THERE,

37:15.633 --> 37:16.966
A CONGRESSMAN COULD A LOCAL

37:17.033 --> 37:17.800
CONGRESSMAN COULD SAY WE SHOULD

37:17.866 --> 37:21.100
ABOLISH THE POLICE.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.533
>> THEY HAVE.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.933
>> Bill: THAT SOUNDS A GOOD

37:24.000 --> 37:24.933
COULD CAUSE SOME VIOLENCE, WHERE

37:25.000 --> 37:27.533
YOU DRAW THE LINE?

37:27.600 --> 37:28.600
>> THIS ISN'T ABOUT AESTHETICS

37:28.666 --> 37:31.666
OF TRUMP, HIS AESTHETICS ARE

37:31.733 --> 37:33.233
AWFUL AND GHASTLY BUT THE THING

37:33.300 --> 37:34.066
THAT BOTHERS ME IS SOME DAY

37:34.133 --> 37:37.000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SMARTER

37:37.066 --> 37:38.566
VERSION OF TRUMP, A RADICAL

37:38.633 --> 37:39.333
AUTHORITARIAN POPULIST WHO IS

37:39.400 --> 37:41.900
GOING TO SAY I KNOW HOW TO NOT

37:41.966 --> 37:43.666
SAY THE FEW KEYWORDS THAT WILL

37:43.733 --> 37:45.200
TRIGGER FACEBOOK TO THROW ME OFF

37:45.266 --> 37:47.100
BUT I KNOW HOW TO USE THE

37:47.166 --> 37:48.266
AMPLIFICATION MECHANISMS OF

37:48.333 --> 37:49.033
FACEBOOK TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK

37:49.100 --> 37:53.433
IT'S OKAY TO L LOAD PEOPLE AND

37:53.500 --> 37:55.000
BOXCARS WE DON'T LIKE THEIR

37:55.066 --> 37:55.500
POLITICS.

37:55.566 --> 37:56.200
THAT'S WHAT FACEBOOK IT'S

37:56.266 --> 37:57.400
DESIGNED TO DO, DESIGNED TO

37:57.466 --> 37:59.066
MOTIVATE PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT IS

37:59.133 --> 38:00.766
MENTALLY IRRESISTIBLE AND THAT

38:00.833 --> 38:02.600
IS A DANGEROUS TOOL ESPECIALLY

38:02.666 --> 38:03.733
IF SOMEONE MORE SOPHISTICATED

38:03.800 --> 38:04.733
THAN TRUMP COMES ALONG IN THE

38:04.800 --> 38:06.233
IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND THERE WILL

38:06.300 --> 38:08.300
BE SOMEONE MORE SOPHISTICATED

38:08.366 --> 38:08.900
THAN TRUMP.

38:08.966 --> 38:12.666
[APPLAUSE]

38:12.733 --> 38:13.533
>> Bill: IT'S GRADUATION

38:13.600 --> 38:15.900
SEASON AND FOR MANY YEARS WE

38:15.966 --> 38:17.233
HAVE SHOWN THE AUDIENCE THE TOP

38:17.300 --> 38:19.100
OF THE GRADUATION CAPS AT KIDS

38:19.166 --> 38:20.166
WHERE, LAST YEAR THERE WAS NO

38:20.233 --> 38:22.000
CEREMONY SO WE COULDN'T DO IT.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.533
THIS YEAR THEY ARE BACK AND THEY

38:23.600 --> 38:24.500
ALWAYS WRITE A MESSAGE,

38:24.566 --> 38:28.766
SOMETIMES VERY BASIC LIKE "HIRE

38:28.833 --> 38:31.066
ME" OR "THANKS MOM AND DAD,"

38:31.133 --> 38:44.166
SOMETIMES WE SAW MORE ELABORATE.

38:44.233 --> 38:44.800
WITH LAST YEAR BEING MORE WEIRD

38:44.866 --> 38:45.366
THEY ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

38:45.433 --> 38:49.233
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE SOME OF

38:49.300 --> 38:53.900
THEM?

38:53.966 --> 38:56.333
I KNEW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE

38:56.400 --> 38:57.433
SOME OF THEM.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.466
VAXXED, WAXED AND RELAXED, CALL

38:58.533 --> 39:01.800
ME, PORNHUB!

39:01.866 --> 39:02.100
[LAUGHTER]

39:02.166 --> 39:05.733
HIRE ME SO I CAN REPORT YOU.

39:05.800 --> 39:06.000
[LAUGHTER]

39:06.066 --> 39:06.666
I BARELY GOT A BA BUT I IDENTIFY

39:06.733 --> 39:13.466
AS A HEART SURGEON.

39:13.533 --> 39:13.733
[LAUGHTER]

39:13.800 --> 39:14.233
[APPLAUSE]

39:14.300 --> 39:14.933
THANKS, FAKE WATER POLO

39:15.000 --> 39:18.766
SCHOLARSHIP!

39:18.833 --> 39:19.033
[LAUGHTER]

39:19.100 --> 39:19.300
[APPLAUSE]

39:19.366 --> 39:23.666
COLLEGE RADICAL, FUTURE KAREN.

39:23.733 --> 39:24.433
[LAUGHTER]

39:24.500 --> 39:25.000
IF YOU CAN READ THIS, YOU'RE

39:25.066 --> 39:26.633
VIOLATING MY SAFE.

39:26.700 --> 39:30.866
SPACE.

39:30.933 --> 39:31.166
[LAUGHTER]

39:31.233 --> 39:31.900
CAME FOR A DEGREE, CAME HARDER

39:31.966 --> 39:35.866
FOR MY PROFESSOR.

39:35.933 --> 39:42.766
TERRIBLE, WHO WROTE THAT?

39:42.833 --> 39:43.033
[LAUGHTER]

39:43.100 --> 39:44.166
AND MY FAVORITE:

39:44.233 --> 39:48.066
I NEVER DID FIND THE LIBRARY.

39:48.133 --> 39:48.666
[LAUGHTER]

39:48.733 --> 39:49.600
I HATE TO BE THE ONE ALWAYS

39:49.666 --> 39:53.433
PICKING ON GEN Z IN THE

39:53.500 --> 39:54.966
MILLENNIALS BUT FRANKLY SOMEONE

39:55.033 --> 39:57.033
HAS TO BECAUSE THEY ARE FUCKING

39:57.100 --> 39:57.733
NUTS.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.066
THERE'S A VIDEO THE CIA PUT OUT

39:59.133 --> 40:03.733
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE CIA, YOU

40:03.800 --> 40:06.066
DID THREE TOURS AS A CIA ANALYST

40:06.133 --> 40:07.400
IN A RACK, THAT IS SERIOUS

40:07.466 --> 40:11.100
SERVICE TO YOUR COUNTRY.

40:11.166 --> 40:12.166
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR

40:12.233 --> 40:13.733
OPINION ON THIS.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.933
IT'S A LITTLE LONGER, WE CUT IT

40:15.000 --> 40:16.933
TOGETHER SO THESE ARE THE MAIN

40:17.000 --> 40:17.166
POINTS.

40:17.233 --> 40:18.900
THIS IS A RECRUITING VIDEO THAT

40:18.966 --> 40:22.400
WAS ON YOUTUBE, IT HAS BEEN

40:22.466 --> 40:23.866
WIDELY CRITICIZED I GUESS SOME

40:23.933 --> 40:25.266
PEOPLE LIKED IT BUT LET'S SHOW

40:25.333 --> 40:26.133
YOU WHAT IT IS, THIS IS REAL,

40:26.200 --> 40:30.533
THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.733
IT'S A YOUTUBE RECRUITING VIDEO

40:31.800 --> 40:35.433
FROM THE CIA, TAKE A LOOK.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.566
>> I AM PERFECTLY MADE, I CAN

40:38.633 --> 40:39.766
WAX ELOQUENT ON COMPLEX LEGAL

40:39.833 --> 40:43.033
ISSUES IN ENGLISH WHILE ALSO

40:43.100 --> 40:48.700
BELTING [SPEAKING SPANISH]

40:48.766 --> 40:50.766
I'M A WOMAN OF COLOR, I'M A MOM,

40:50.833 --> 40:55.266
I'M A CISGENDER MILLENNIAL WHO

40:55.333 --> 40:57.100
HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ANXIETY

40:57.166 --> 41:00.500
DISORDER, I DID NOT SNEAK INTO

41:00.566 --> 41:02.700
CIA, MY EMPLOYMENT DID NOT SLIP

41:02.766 --> 41:07.500
TO THE CRACKS, I'M TIRED OF

41:07.566 --> 41:08.800
FEELING LIKE I AM SUPPOSED TO

41:08.866 --> 41:12.433
APOLOGIZE RATHER THAN INTOXICATE

41:12.500 --> 41:14.433
PEOPLE WITH MY EFFORT AND

41:14.500 --> 41:16.166
BRILLIANCE.

41:16.233 --> 41:18.366
IF I AM PROUD OF ME, FULL.

41:18.433 --> 41:19.933
>> Bill: WHAT IS WRONG WITH

41:20.000 --> 41:20.633
THIS GENERATION?

41:20.700 --> 41:21.566
DOES EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM HAVE

41:21.633 --> 41:22.900
TO BE REPORTED LIKE THEY THE

41:22.966 --> 41:23.766
MOST INTERESTING PERSON IN THE

41:23.833 --> 41:26.366
WORLD, DO WE WANT TO SOMEONE IN

41:26.433 --> 41:30.333
THE CIA THIS SELF-INVOLVED?

41:30.400 --> 41:33.633
[APPLAUSE]

41:33.700 --> 41:35.700
>> AS THE CIA OFFICER IN THE

41:35.766 --> 41:36.566
ROOM I WATCH THIS A COUPLE DAYS

41:36.633 --> 41:39.566
AGO AND I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHO

41:39.633 --> 41:41.833
THEY ARE TRYING TO APPEAL TO

41:41.900 --> 41:43.266
BECAUSE THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO

41:43.333 --> 41:44.966
ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING TO

41:45.033 --> 41:45.600
SERVE THEIR COUNTRY ARE

41:45.666 --> 41:46.233
INTERESTED IN THE MISSION THAT

41:46.300 --> 41:48.700
IS BIGGER THAN THEMSELVES.

41:48.766 --> 41:52.566
>> Bill: IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU!

41:52.633 --> 41:54.566
[APPLAUSE]

41:54.633 --> 41:56.100
THERE IS AN INDULGENCE ABOUT

41:56.166 --> 41:58.100
THAT KIND OF THING BROADLY WHERE

41:58.166 --> 42:00.633
IT'S YOUR IDENTIFIERS FOR

42:00.700 --> 42:02.066
WHATEVER CHARACTERISTICS YOU

42:02.133 --> 42:02.700
HAVE BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN

42:02.766 --> 42:06.333
THE WORK YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.100
AND I THINK -- THE GREATEST

42:08.166 --> 42:09.266
GENERATION IS LEAVING US NOW BUT

42:09.333 --> 42:12.466
THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT GO

42:12.533 --> 42:14.300
AND VOLUNTEER AFTER THE JAPANESE

42:14.366 --> 42:16.100
BOMBED PEARL HARBOR OR THE SWEPT

42:16.166 --> 42:17.733
ACROSS EUROPE, THEY DIDN'T WAIT

42:17.800 --> 42:20.466
IN THE RECRUITING LINE TO TALK

42:20.533 --> 42:21.866
ABOUT A SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL

42:21.933 --> 42:22.500
CHARACTERISTICS, THEY ARE LIKE

42:22.566 --> 42:26.500
"LET ME GO KILL.

42:26.566 --> 42:28.566
"AND SOMETIME YOU WANT TO KILL,

42:28.633 --> 42:31.866
KILL BAD GUYS.

42:31.933 --> 42:33.200
>> I HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE

42:33.266 --> 42:35.100
WORK FOR ME I SPENT MY TIME WITH

42:35.166 --> 42:36.100
A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK

42:36.166 --> 42:38.733
THIS MISSES THE MARK, I THINK

42:38.800 --> 42:39.300
THEY ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE

42:39.366 --> 42:42.866
AVERAGE YOUNG PERSON.

42:42.933 --> 42:44.266
>> Bill: I COULDN'T AGREE

42:44.333 --> 42:44.466
MORE.

42:44.533 --> 42:45.466
>> I HOPE SO.

42:45.533 --> 42:47.766
>> Bill: EVEN IF THIS WASN'T

42:47.833 --> 42:50.100
JUST ABOUT THE CIA, QUOTE FROM

42:50.166 --> 42:52.366
IT, THE FIRST LINE "I AM

42:52.433 --> 42:53.733
PERFECTLY MADE."

42:53.800 --> 42:55.466
THIS IS BAD ADVICE ANY TIME.

42:55.533 --> 42:56.800
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE AN OBESITY

42:56.866 --> 42:58.566
PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY, THIS IS

42:58.633 --> 43:00.100
WHY WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN

43:00.166 --> 43:03.500
THIS COUNTRY.

43:03.566 --> 43:04.066
WHY COULD THERE BE ANYTHING

43:04.133 --> 43:04.400
WRONG WITH ME?

43:04.466 --> 43:04.866
I ME.

43:04.933 --> 43:07.266
IF TERRIBLE ATTITUDE.

43:07.333 --> 43:15.900
>> EXCEPT YOU, BILL.

43:15.966 --> 43:18.333
>> Bill: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

43:18.400 --> 43:20.466
>> YOUR PERFECT!

43:20.533 --> 43:24.900
>> Bill: I DETECT SOME SARCASM

43:24.966 --> 43:25.100
THERE!

43:25.166 --> 43:28.933
>> MOVING ALONG.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.733
>> Bill: I'M NOT PERFECT BUT

43:30.800 --> 43:31.700
I'M RIGHT ABOUT A LOT OF SHIT

43:31.766 --> 43:33.133
THE PEOPLE WON'T TALK ABOUT,

43:33.200 --> 43:35.300
LIKE THIS.

43:35.366 --> 43:37.500
"I'M A WOMAN OF COLOR, I'M A

43:37.566 --> 43:40.900
MOM, I'M A CISGENDER MILLENNIAL"

43:40.966 --> 43:44.100
IS A SEDATING APP?

43:44.166 --> 43:45.433
WHO'S BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A

43:45.500 --> 43:46.866
GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER, DO I

43:46.933 --> 43:47.933
WANT THAT IN THE CIA?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.066
LEASE TO THROW YOU OUT OF THE

43:49.133 --> 43:51.866
ARMY FOR FLAT FEET.

43:51.933 --> 43:53.533
I DID NOT SNEAK INTO THE CIA,

43:53.600 --> 43:58.500
WHO SAID YOU DID TO?

43:58.566 --> 44:02.966
SUCH DRAMA QUEEN SPIRIT OF "I'M

44:03.033 --> 44:04.000
TIRED OF FEELING LIKE I'M NOT

44:04.066 --> 44:07.833
SUPPOSED TO APOLOGIZE THAT SHE

44:07.900 --> 44:11.066
WAS MAKING YOU?"

44:11.133 --> 44:13.666
I'D RATHER INTOXICATE PEOPLE

44:13.733 --> 44:14.666
WITH MY BRILLIANCE, WHO RAISE

44:14.733 --> 44:18.566
THESE JELLYFISH?

44:18.633 --> 44:21.633
MOVING ON.

44:21.700 --> 44:22.966
SO HERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE I'M

44:23.033 --> 44:26.433
RIGHT ABOUT.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.066
POPULATION, THE CENSUS CAME OUT

44:28.133 --> 44:29.700
LAST WEEKEND WE HAVE THE LOWEST

44:29.766 --> 44:33.933
POPULATION GROWTH IN LIKE 100

44:34.000 --> 44:37.533
YEARS.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.766
THE NUMBERS -- BIRTHRATES 19%

44:38.833 --> 44:42.666
DOWN SINCE 2007.

44:42.733 --> 44:44.300
4% DOWN IN 2020.

44:44.366 --> 44:46.033
ALL ECONOMISTS WILL SAY THIS IS

44:46.100 --> 44:47.166
A TERRIBLE THING BECAUSE EVERY

44:47.233 --> 44:49.500
ECONOMY NO MATTER WHAT IT IS IS

44:49.566 --> 44:50.200
BUILT ON THIS IDEA THAT YOU HAVE

44:50.266 --> 44:53.133
TO KEEP REPLACING WORKERS -- I

44:53.200 --> 44:55.400
DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE CAN KEEP

44:55.466 --> 44:57.533
PRETENDING THAT WE CAN KEEP

44:57.600 --> 44:58.166
ADDING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT'S GOOD

44:58.233 --> 45:01.866
FOR THE ECONOMY.

45:01.933 --> 45:03.866
WE ALREADY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH

45:03.933 --> 45:05.000
RESOURCES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

45:05.066 --> 45:07.266
HERE NOW.

45:07.333 --> 45:10.200
THIS IS GREAT NEWS THAT THE

45:10.266 --> 45:13.400
POPULATION IS GOING DOWN.

45:13.466 --> 45:20.866
GREAT NEWS, FULL.

45:20.933 --> 45:24.566
>> THIS IS HAPPENING GLOBALLY,

45:24.633 --> 45:26.500
THE WORLD POPULATION GROWTH IS

45:26.566 --> 45:29.200
GOING TO PEAK AROUND 2050, 2070

45:29.266 --> 45:32.600
AND BE ON A LONG SLOW DECLINE.

45:32.666 --> 45:34.133
AT THE END OF THE DAY THE

45:34.200 --> 45:36.000
CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE WORLD

45:36.066 --> 45:37.466
IS -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO A

45:37.533 --> 45:39.700
LOT OF TRICKS AND TWEAKS ON IT

45:39.766 --> 45:40.566
BUT IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO

45:40.633 --> 45:41.566
CARRYING CAPACITY IN A LOT OF

45:41.633 --> 45:42.766
PLACES IN THE WORLD WE DON'T

45:42.833 --> 45:45.666
HAVE A LOT OF LUXURY ON THAT.

45:45.733 --> 45:46.600
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR POPULATION

45:46.666 --> 45:49.100
TO CRASH OUT IN ZERO, JAPAN IS

45:49.166 --> 45:52.533
NOT GOING TO EXIST IN 150 YEARS.

45:52.600 --> 45:55.166
>> Bill: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

45:55.233 --> 45:55.366
ABOUT?

45:55.433 --> 45:57.666
>> THEY ARE WAY BELOW POPULATION

45:57.733 --> 45:57.966
REPLACEMENT.

45:58.033 --> 45:59.433
>> Bill: LIKE YOU CAN PREDICT

45:59.500 --> 46:02.266
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN 150

46:02.333 --> 46:04.300
YEARS.

46:04.366 --> 46:05.666
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

46:05.733 --> 46:09.766
>> IS NOT LIKE THE 19TH CENTURY

46:09.833 --> 46:10.033
ANYMORE.

46:10.100 --> 46:12.700
>> Bill: TOO MANY ARE DATING

46:12.766 --> 46:14.866
THEIR PHONES, BUT THERE WILL BE

46:14.933 --> 46:17.100
SOME NEW JAPANESE PEOPLE.

46:17.166 --> 46:17.933
>> SOME.

46:18.000 --> 46:18.500
>> Bill: SOME.

46:18.566 --> 46:20.366
>> I INTERPRET IT DIFFERENTLY, I

46:20.433 --> 46:21.800
KNOW THIS IS ONE OF YOUR ISSUES

46:21.866 --> 46:25.066
BUT I READ IT AS -- THE THING I

46:25.133 --> 46:26.600
HEAR EVERY DAY IS PEOPLE MAKING

46:26.666 --> 46:28.600
AN ECONOMIC DECISION NOT TO HAVE

46:28.666 --> 46:30.033
CHILDREN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

46:30.100 --> 46:31.566
AFFORD IT, BECAUSE THEY AREN'T

46:31.633 --> 46:32.633
DOING AS WELL AS THEIR PARENTS

46:32.700 --> 46:33.933
AND THEY CAN'T PROVIDE FOR THEIR

46:34.000 --> 46:34.300
KIDS.

46:34.366 --> 46:36.966
I SAW IT AS AN ECONOMIC DECISION

46:37.033 --> 46:38.866
IN ADDITION TO DATING THEIR

46:38.933 --> 46:39.566
PHONES.

46:39.633 --> 46:40.400
>> Bill: YOU COULD HAVE ONE

46:40.466 --> 46:43.633
KID OR TWO.

46:43.700 --> 46:46.600
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T HAVE FIVE

46:46.666 --> 46:47.466
OR SIX.

46:47.533 --> 46:49.133
>> I JUST DON'T THINK WE ARE

46:49.200 --> 46:50.366
GOING TO GET INTO THAT MOUTHY

46:50.433 --> 46:51.966
WAS THE INVASION OF THE WORLD

46:52.033 --> 46:53.266
WITH 20 BILLION PEOPLE WERE NOT

46:53.333 --> 46:54.033
GOING TO GET THERE.

46:54.100 --> 46:55.666
>> Bill: THAT'S CERTAINLY

46:55.733 --> 46:56.700
WHERE WE ARE HEADING.

46:56.766 --> 46:59.166
>> IT'S STARTED TO TAPER OFF IN

46:59.233 --> 46:59.933
A LOT OF COUNTRIES.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.633
>> THE MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY

47:01.700 --> 47:04.033
ADVANCED THE COUNTRY BECOMES,

47:04.100 --> 47:04.366
THE LESS KIDS.

47:04.433 --> 47:06.666
>> Bill: YES.

47:06.733 --> 47:10.133
THANK YOU.

47:10.200 --> 47:13.900
NOW IT'S TIME FOR NEW RULES!

47:13.966 --> 47:14.566

47:28.433 --> 47:29.133
PORN, SOMEONE HAS TO TELL HIM

47:29.200 --> 47:30.233
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE MEANT BY

47:30.300 --> 47:30.933
"FAMILY RESEARCH."

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT

47:32.066 --> 47:32.866
ANYBODY MEANT BY. "19 KIDS AND

47:32.933 --> 47:38.466

47:48.000 --> 47:48.566

47:51.233 --> 47:52.500

GOING TO ASK ME, "HAVE YOU BEEN

47:53.433 --> 47:57.233

48:15.633 --> 48:16.900
PFIZER IS MAKING MONKEY PEOPLE.
