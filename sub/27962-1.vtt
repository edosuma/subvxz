Leo can never make a baby.

(FAINT PIANO SOLO)

08:22.434 --> 08:24.868
When a loved one
dies unexpectedly,

08:24.870 --> 08:26.769
that loss is devastating.

08:26.771 --> 08:29.772
But that loss doesn't
have to be permanent.

08:29.774 --> 08:34.109
First, a sample of the
loved ones DNA is collected.

08:34.111 --> 08:38.315
Then a woman's egg is stripped
of all it's genetic material.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.950
The DNA and the egg
are fused together

08:40.952 --> 08:42.889
and form into an embryo.

08:44.221 --> 08:46.589
That embryo is
placed into a womb

08:46.591 --> 08:49.358
and begins to develop and grow.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.262
Nine months later
a child is born.

08:52.264 --> 08:55.301
This reproductive process
is called cloning.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.536
However, because of the
way genes are influenced

08:59.538 --> 09:01.204
during the process
of reproduction

09:01.206 --> 09:03.406
by environment, nutrition,

09:03.408 --> 09:05.975
and a variety of other
external factors,

09:05.977 --> 09:09.244
the clone will not look
exactly like the loved one.

09:09.246 --> 09:12.715
More like a cousin,
a brother, or a son.

09:12.717 --> 09:15.687
So theoretically, no
one will ever know.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.656
In a moments time
tragedy can be erased

09:19.658 --> 09:22.495
and life as we know
it can be re-imagined.

09:27.832 --> 09:29.866
There are also some risks.

09:29.868 --> 09:32.572
There's a chance that the
procedure won't work at all.

09:33.871 --> 09:35.338
There's also the
possibility that the baby

09:35.340 --> 09:37.076
may not be as healthy as a baby

09:38.376 --> 09:40.142
conceived naturally.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.713
JOSIE: What do
you mean by that?

09:43.148 --> 09:45.418
Well none of your genes
will be in this baby Josie.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.754
This will only be Leo, all Leo.

09:50.855 --> 09:51.756
That's cloning.

09:54.592 --> 09:55.927
This has never been done.

09:57.428 --> 09:59.298

procedure can work.
