WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.836
- A pancake breakfast
to celebrate us

00:03.920 --> 00:04.546
getting into the playoffs.

00:04.629 --> 00:06.840
This is amazing, you guys.

00:06.923 --> 00:09.300
- Oh, uh, can I
have a waffle?

00:09.384 --> 00:12.095
- Uh, this is a pancake
breakfast.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.555
- But I like waffles.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.265
They have little holes
to catch the syrup. Ha.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.516
- All right, I'll make
you a waffle.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.102
- Oh, great.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.231
- Enjoy!

00:25.900 --> 00:27.485
- Thanks.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.198
- Whoa, looks like
someone's carbo-loading

00:32.281 --> 00:33.867
to get extra energy
for the playoff game.

00:33.950 --> 00:37.328
- Actually, this is
my normal breakfast.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.622
But you're right.
I should be carbo-loading.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.957
Hope it's not too late.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.960
Oh! More pancakes, please.

00:44.043 --> 00:47.046
Actually,
I'll serve myself.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.800
- Big week, guys.
Check it.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.637
I got my driver's
permit! Sure!

00:54.721 --> 00:58.850
And I get to play in my first
playoff game. Booya!

00:58.933 --> 01:01.811
- And I get to eat real bacon.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.105
My stepmom Brenda
only serves tofacon.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.358
- What's that?
- Bacon made of tofu.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.276
And lies.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.070
[sniffing]
Mmmmm!

01:11.154 --> 01:12.614
You don't lie,
now do you, baby?

01:12.697 --> 01:15.992
[crunching]
Oh...

01:16.075 --> 01:18.036
- I can't watch this.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.998
Hey, Mrs. Silverstein.
How are you feeling?

01:22.081 --> 01:23.458
- Great. Ooh!

01:23.541 --> 01:25.293
Except this baby's using
my bladder as a pillow.

01:25.376 --> 01:25.960
So I'm going to
the bathroom again.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.339
Pregnancy is so glamorous!

01:29.422 --> 01:31.508
- BELLA: Pepper,
your mom is so cute.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.426
I can't wait to help you throw
that baby shower on Saturday.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.386
- Oh, I know.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.138
It's gonna be the perfect
way to welcome

01:37.222 --> 01:39.057
my baby brother
into the world.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.142
- [whistle shrills]
- Listen up!

01:41.226 --> 01:43.394
There's a severe weather
advisory for Friday,

01:43.478 --> 01:46.189
so we're moving the playoff
game to Saturday night.

01:46.272 --> 01:46.856
- BELLA: What?
- SAWYER: Yes!

01:46.940 --> 01:48.149
Another day to carbo-load.

01:48.233 --> 01:53.112
Now I have time for syrup.
Thank you, weatherman.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.323
- But Saturday
is the baby shower.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.075
Bella, we've been
planning this for weeks.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.993
You're going to be
there, right?

01:59.077 --> 02:00.036
- Totally!

02:00.119 --> 02:01.496
- But you're playing
in the game, right?

02:01.579 --> 02:03.373
- Totally!

02:03.456 --> 02:04.374
- You're just
saying "totally"

02:04.457 --> 02:06.918
'cause you have no idea
what to do, right?

02:07.001 --> 02:08.377

{\an8}But this is the playoffs.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.422
{\an8}I didn't get to
play last year,

02:52.505 --> 02:54.424
{\an8}and I may never get
the chance again.

02:54.507 --> 02:57.176
{\an8}- I know and we're supposed
to be there to cheer you on.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.845
{\an8}- Right. So, let's ask
your mom to move

02:58.928 --> 02:59.846
{\an8}the date of the baby shower.

02:59.929 --> 03:03.308
{\an8}- Forget ask. Tell.
This is the playoffs.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.935
{\an8}Be firm.
- Firm. Got it.

03:06.019 --> 03:10.607
{\an8}Mommy! Uh...um...

03:10.690 --> 03:14.068
{\an8}We just found out the playoff
game is Saturday.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.486
Would it be at all possible

03:15.570 --> 03:17.322
to move the baby
shower to Sunday?

03:17.405 --> 03:18.239
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry,

03:18.323 --> 03:20.617
but this has been
planned for months.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.826
People are flying
in from out of town.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.370
Do you really want your Aunt
Gladys to pay a change fee?

03:24.454 --> 03:29.125
- No. She's mean
and has a moustache.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.295
- Thank you for
understanding.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.963
- What are we gonna do?

03:34.047 --> 03:36.466
- Wait, I have an idea.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.469
Everybody huddle up.
Okay, here's the game plan.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.262
We're going to run
a hurry-up offense.

03:41.346 --> 03:41.971
We'll cram all the fun
of a two-hour party

03:42.055 --> 03:43.973
into one concentrated hour.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.684
It'll be fast,
it'll be fabulous,

03:46.768 --> 03:49.312
and we'll get to the game with
plenty of time to spare.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.980
Hands in.
Shabooya on three.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.024
One, two, three!
- ALL: Shabooya!

03:53.107 --> 03:55.318
- Wow, so that's
what it feels like

03:55.401 --> 03:58.988
to be in a huddle with you.
- It's weird.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.116
But I feel super motivated to
tackle someone right now.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.826
- Don't you always
feel like that?

04:03.910 --> 04:05.495
- Huh, pretty much.

04:05.578 --> 04:09.082
- ♪

04:09.165 --> 04:12.001
- You'll never believe
what happened.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.712
I was eating the pancakes
I took home yesterday and...

04:14.796 --> 04:17.507
incredible, right?

04:17.589 --> 04:18.675
- I'm sorry, what are
we looking at?

04:18.757 --> 04:20.760
- Drake, dude.

04:20.843 --> 04:24.180
The pancake looks just
like Drake--the rapper.

04:24.263 --> 04:25.807
- I know who Drake is.
- Oh.

04:25.890 --> 04:29.352
- And no.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.188
- Hey, guys. Oh, Drake.
Awesome.

04:32.271 --> 04:35.650
Anyway, uh, Troy,
I just saw Niecy Johnson

04:35.733 --> 04:38.069
in the parking lot.
- Niecy Johnson?

04:38.152 --> 04:39.362
How do I look?

04:39.445 --> 04:41.990
Shoot, I always look good.
Excuse me.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.536
- He's right.
He always looks great.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.954
- Niecy's not really outside.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.415
That was just an excuse
to get Troy out of here.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.792
Look at this.
- Whoa!

04:52.875 --> 04:54.919
A real newspaper
did a story on the team?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.255
- Yeah, and it predicts that
we're gonna lose the playoffs.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.632
- What? Why?
- Because of Troy.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.553
It says every time Troy plays
the Red Devils, he chokes.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.762
And that's the nicest
thing they say about him.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.224
We can't let him see this.
It would destroy his confidence.

05:08.307 --> 05:10.059
- I don't know.
Troy's ego is huge.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.770
Some article isn't
gonna bother him.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.230
- Mm, I beg to differ.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.606
Remember when the school
newspaper insulted

05:15.690 --> 05:16.983
his breakdancing at
the school talent show?

05:17.066 --> 05:20.153
He never popped
or locked again.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.612
[sighing]

05:21.696 --> 05:23.573
- Our loss.
- And the world's.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.241
- That was a school newspaper.

05:25.324 --> 05:27.118
Imagine what happens
when he reads

05:27.201 --> 05:28.161
something from
a real newspaper?

05:28.244 --> 05:30.663
- Right before the playoffs.
Not good.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.540
We have to gather
the rest of these

05:32.623 --> 05:36.085
and get rid of them
before Troy sees them.

05:36.169 --> 05:36.794
- Hey!
- Are you--

05:36.878 --> 05:38.504
- Sorry, ma'am.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.970
- Niecy wasn't out there.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.974
What are you doing
with those newspapers?

05:50.058 --> 05:53.936
- Just collecting coupons
for this great sale.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.188
- Pantyhose?

05:55.271 --> 05:57.607
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah, pantyhose.

05:57.690 --> 06:02.028
Trying to decide between
regular or control top.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.905
- Come on, Sawyer.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.948
They're on sale.
Get both.

06:08.868 --> 06:14.624
- ♪

06:14.707 --> 06:16.125
- Oh, girls, thank you
so much for this.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.960
Everything looks beautiful.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.505
- You're welcome.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.673
- Okay, I budgeted 60 minutes
for the baby shower

06:22.757 --> 06:24.675
and 30 minutes to
get to the game.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.427
We're already
13 minutes behind,

06:26.511 --> 06:27.804
but we can't start until
all the guests get here.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.807
- Who are we waiting on?
- My mom's co-worker, Marcy.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.849
She's the worst.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.269
She was once late for
a meeting about lateness.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.271
- Oh, hi! Sorry, I'm late.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.065
You'll never believe
what happened.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.192
- Ah, you're Miss Richards.
Come on, Marcy, sit down.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.652
- Okay.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.154
- Hello, ladies and welcome to
the Silverstein baby shower.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.447
We're going to hit the ground
running with our first activity.

06:46.531 --> 06:50.493
- Painting baby bibs.
- SOPHIE: Uh-huh.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.829
All right, get going people.
Don't think, just paint.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.580
Here you go.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.002
- Okay, time's up, everybody.
Stop painting.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.380
- But so soon?

07:02.463 --> 07:03.631
But my baby doesn't
have a mouth.

07:03.714 --> 07:07.218
- Good. Then it can't cry.
Hand them in, people.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.929
- Okay, for our next game this
little guy lost his pacifier.

07:10.012 --> 07:10.847
- Oh, no!

07:10.930 --> 07:12.849
- It's hidden somewhere
in this room.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.017
- Where could it be?
- Get searching.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.566
This isn't moving fast enough.
We need to motivate them.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.276
Is there anything we could
give them as a prize?

07:23.359 --> 07:25.528
- Ooh! I know
the perfect thing.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.574
- Um, the...there will
be an amazing prize

07:29.657 --> 07:31.701
for the first person
to find it.

07:31.784 --> 07:37.290
It's...it's...
wait for it.

07:37.373 --> 07:39.041
- A blender!
Chops, mixes, dices.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.211
For smoothies and shakes.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.255
- I have one just like that.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.465
- Not anymore.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.760
- Get out of my way!
That blender is mine!

07:54.932 --> 07:56.642
- Come on, Gladys!
- BELLA: Oh, no.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.561
This really isn't happening
for Aunt Gladys.

07:58.644 --> 07:59.979
- PEPPER:
What are we gonna do?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.105
We have seven minutes
to break this piñata

08:01.189 --> 08:02.899
and get back on track.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.651
- I got this.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.907
- ALL: [cheering]

08:10.990 --> 08:12.909
- You did it!
Great job, Aunt Gladys.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.578
- I still got it!

08:17.121 --> 08:19.582
- Sophie for the win.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.417
- Hey, thank you for doing
that for Aunt Gladys.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.794
She's such a sweet old lady.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.880
- Oh! Get away from my
butterscotch, you vultures, you!

08:25.963 --> 08:28.674
Get away!

08:33.846 --> 08:34.764
- Okay, I got rid of
all the newspapers

08:34.847 --> 08:37.600
from the ice cream store
and the comic book shop.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.018
How'd you do?

08:39.101 --> 08:41.102
- I went to the grocery store
and the public library.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.020
- Troy doesn't go to
the public library.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.106
- Exactly.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.900
That's why I dumped all
the newspapers there.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.485
- Smart.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.528
- Who's ready to crush
the Red Devils?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.364
- ALL: [applauding]
Yeah!

08:51.447 --> 08:52.949
- Not strong enough.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.201
Who's ready to obliterate
the Red Devils?

08:55.284 --> 08:57.954
- ALL: Yeah! Whoo!
- Yeah.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.081
- Troy is good to go.
Mission accomplished, buddy.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.332
- Thanks, Sawyer.
We make a pretty good team.

09:01.415 --> 09:04.168
- Yeah, we do.
Sawyer and Newt.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.629
Newt and Sawyer.
Newter!

09:06.712 --> 09:08.297
- Oh, no, please
don't call us that.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.132
- Those Red Devils
are going down!

09:10.216 --> 09:11.425
Right, Coach?

09:11.509 --> 09:13.636
- Oh, that's what I like
to see, Dixon.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.555
Not letting that Silverado
Weekly article get you down.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.432
Way to be a leader.
- Thank you.

09:18.516 --> 09:22.019
Wait, what Silverado
Weekly article?

09:22.103 --> 09:25.481
- Uh, that article about,
uh...global warming.

09:25.564 --> 09:28.067
- Yeah, yeah,
really got me down.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.902
The world's an oven
and we're cookin' in it.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.822
A shame.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.824
- "Receiver Troy Dixon has
a tendency to let the pressure

09:34.907 --> 09:37.827
"get to him when the Bulldogs
play the Red Devils.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.496
"The last two times
the teams met, he choked.

09:40.579 --> 09:43.833
This time should
be no different."

09:43.916 --> 09:45.209
- Don't listen to them, Troy.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.794
- Yeah, they don't know what
they're talking about.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.338
That newspaper is nothing
but a big ad for pantyhose.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.340
- "For a supposed team leader,

09:51.424 --> 09:55.761
the only thing Dixon will lead
the Bulldogs to is defeat."

09:55.845 --> 09:57.555
Why would they say about me?

09:57.638 --> 09:58.681
- Oh, you know the media.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.184
Always biased against really
attractive people.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.519
- Like you, Troy.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.396
He's saying you're attractive.
Focus on that.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.607
- Of course, I am.
It's not about that.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.569
That newspaper totally
took me down.

10:11.652 --> 10:14.530
It's like the school talent
show all over again.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.115
I feel weird.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.034
I think I'm gonna throw up.
[retches]

10:18.117 --> 10:19.952
I haven't thrown up since
the second grade.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.078
I don't even remember
how it works.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.872
[retches]

10:22.955 --> 10:24.415
Nothing's coming out.
[retches]

10:24.498 --> 10:27.710
The Troy is broken.
[retching]

10:30.296 --> 10:32.048
- [retches]

10:34.717 --> 10:35.259
- Loved having ya.
- Bye.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.471
- Drive safe.
- Bye.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.639
- [door slamming]

10:39.722 --> 10:42.516
- Okay, we did it
and we still have...

10:42.600 --> 10:45.061
17 minutes 'til
the kickoff.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.563
- Girls, thank you so much for
that whirlwind of a party.

10:47.646 --> 10:50.232
Now go get to that--game!

10:50.316 --> 10:52.068
- Mom, are you okay?

10:52.151 --> 10:56.572
- Ooh, well, I know that I am
not due for another three weeks,

10:56.655 --> 10:58.824
but, uh, something feels
kind of different.

10:58.908 --> 11:03.579
And I just...oh, I think I might
be having this baby today.

11:03.662 --> 11:06.290
- Pepper, maybe you should
call your dad.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.750
- I'm trying.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.627
He's fishing and there's
no reception on the lake.

11:09.710 --> 11:10.628
- Ooh! Okay,
get ready, girls,

11:10.711 --> 11:13.673
because if you can't
get ahold of him soon,

11:13.756 --> 11:15.758
you might be
delivering this baby.

11:15.841 --> 11:16.592
- Wait, wait, wait...us?

11:16.675 --> 11:20.429
Deliver the...the...
the...whoa!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.765
[heavy thud]

11:22.848 --> 11:24.975
- Uh-oh.
- Don't worry, Bella.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.644
Go to the game.
I got this.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.354
I'll just hold
down the fort.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.939
I'll somehow
revive Sophie.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.107
I'll read how to
deliver a baby online

11:31.190 --> 11:34.151
and... [wheezing]

11:34.235 --> 11:35.820
and then I'll figure
out how to stop myself

11:35.903 --> 11:38.489
from hyperventilating.
[wheezing]

11:38.572 --> 11:40.783
I'll be...
[wheezing] fine.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.952
- Right now being
here is more important

11:43.035 --> 11:45.454
than getting to a game on time,
even a playoff game.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.998
I'm not going anywhere.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.876
- [wheezing] Bella,
you're...the...best.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.838
- PEPPER's MOM: Ohhh!
- PEPPER: [wheezing]

11:53.921 --> 11:55.756
- Ooh! A butterscotch.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.683
- ♪

12:05.766 --> 12:08.686
- Okay, the situation
is under control.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.645
I found your dad.

12:09.728 --> 12:11.730
Well, technically,
I called the bait shop

12:11.814 --> 12:13.983
and they're sending a guy
on a jet ski to get him.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.151
He'll be here in
a half an hour.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.653
Your...your dad,
not the guy on the jet ski.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.113
- Oh, good.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.282
Okay, well, when he gets here,
you girls can go to the game.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.491
- Thanks.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.660
If all goes as planned I'll
only miss the first quarter.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.829
I'm gonna call Coach
and give him a heads up.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.497
- So I really passed out?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.707
- You really did.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.001
- Did I at least pass out
in a cool way?

12:32.084 --> 12:36.172
- It was, by far, the coolest
pass out I have ever seen.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.965
[silently] No.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.802
- It's nothing to do with me.
It's not my fault.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.887
It happens to me every time
I go on the field.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.431
Everybody's going to see.
What am I supposed to do?

12:45.514 --> 12:47.600
- If Troy goes out on the field
like this, we're dead.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.726
What do we do?
- Hmm.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.562
First thing I can think
of is punching him.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.856
But...that sounds wrong.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.609
- Troy, you have to forget
about that article.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.027
- I can't.

12:58.110 --> 12:58.861
You heard what that
writer said about me.

12:58.944 --> 12:59.904
I'm gonna go out there
and choke.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.198
- People say things they
don't mean all the time.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.657
"I love vegetables."
"I floss every day."

13:03.741 --> 13:06.619
"Oh, don't listen to
them, Brenda.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.662
That dress is totally
appropriate for church."

13:08.746 --> 13:11.707
- I'm doomed.
And so is this team.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.959
You can say goodbye
to the championship.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.171
- We're in big trouble.
- Okay, let's not panic.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.381
I'm sure Bella will fix things
as soon as she gets here.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.716
- Listen up, team.

13:20.799 --> 13:21.217
I just got off the phone
with Bella.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.302
She got held up.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.678
She probably won't be
here until half time.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.473
- What?
- If she gets here at all.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.558
- Oh, okay, now I'm
gonna panic.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.310
- Dixon, you're playing
quarterback.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.561
- Uh, bad idea, Coach.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.731
Unless you want to lose this
game because I am a choker.

13:35.814 --> 13:38.150
- I thought the article
didn't affect him.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.235
- Well, it did.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.569
Now we only have two
minutes until the game

13:40.653 --> 13:43.739
and our only QB
is doing...that.

13:43.822 --> 13:46.742
- Uh, all right, uh...
we can fix this.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.244
Let me think.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.411
- What would Bella do?

13:49.495 --> 13:52.081
- Probably give Troy one of
her trademark pep talks.

13:52.164 --> 13:52.748
- I can try.

13:52.831 --> 13:56.919
All right, guys, huddle up.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.879
Teamwork!
You can do this, Troy.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.007
Kittens, rainbows,
unicorns, shabooyahs.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.593
Sorry, guys, I really thought
I'd be better at this.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.555
- What do we do, Coach?

14:07.638 --> 14:08.931
- New plan.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.683
Let's get him on the field,
see if he plays.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.102
- I'll grab his feet.
- I'll get the door.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.065
- Move it, move it,
move it.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.111
- SPECTATORS: [cheering]
- [whistle shrills]

14:25.364 --> 14:28.659
{\an8}- Okay, it says here to stay
hydrated and keep moving.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.160
{\an8}Also, if labor occurs
on the airplane

14:30.244 --> 14:32.121
{\an8}the pilot should land
immediately.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.999
{\an8}So don't plan any Hawaiian
vacations in the next few hours.

14:35.082 --> 14:36.875
- [groans]
- Right, not the time for jokes.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.461
Sophie, did you get
the chilled washcloth?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.881
- Yep. Works great.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.801
- Sophie, that's for
Mrs. Silverstein.

14:45.884 --> 14:50.014
- I'm sorry, was she
the one that fainted?

14:50.097 --> 14:52.850
Fine, I'll go get
her another one. Yeah.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.810
- I grabbed some things
for the hospital.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.646
Technically everything.
I grabbed it all.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.981
- Is that my wedding dress?

14:59.064 --> 15:01.066
- I don't know.
It caught my eye.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.735
- Pepper, have you heard
from your dad?

15:02.818 --> 15:04.653
Shouldn't he be here by now?
- Ohhhhh!

15:04.737 --> 15:05.904
We can't wait
for my husband.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.157
- Oh, okay.
I'll call an ambulance.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.158
- No, there's no time.
This baby is coming.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.994
We need to leave now.
How am I going to--

15:12.077 --> 15:13.662
- Okay, I...I just got
my driver's permit.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.289
I can drive to
the hospital

15:15.372 --> 15:17.374
as long as there's
an adult in the car.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.501
- Haven't you had only
one driving class?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.670
- Technically,
one and a half.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.341
- Works for me!
Let's go!

15:25.424 --> 15:27.551
Go, go, go!

15:31.597 --> 15:34.183
- Man, Troy is a mess.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.310
- TROY: Oh...

15:36.393 --> 15:37.853
- He hasn't completed
a single pass.

15:37.936 --> 15:41.565
- Except to the other
team...twice.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.983
- I'm starting to wonder
if he should sit on the bench

15:43.067 --> 15:45.027
and you should go out there
and give it a whirl.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.780
- Let's not get
carried away.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.823
- Okay, Bulldogs, I know
this looks bad now,

15:49.907 --> 15:51.617
but we're only down
by two touchdowns.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.703
- Yeah, so far.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.539
- Dixon, shake it off.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.209
This is football.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.836
- [whining]
Oh, it won't shake off.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.048
- Coach, I got this.
Troy--

16:06.131 --> 16:07.049
- Look, whatever
stupid pep talk

16:07.132 --> 16:08.967
you're gonna give me,
it's not gonna work.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.260
- I'm not gonna give
you a pep talk.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.639
The Silverado Weekly printed
a response to the last article.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.432
"It has come to
our attention

16:15.516 --> 16:18.060
"that Troy Dixon was treated
unfairly by this publication.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.062
"Since previous games
against the Red Devils,

16:20.145 --> 16:22.064
"Dixon has grown
and proven himself

16:22.147 --> 16:22.981
in high pressure situations."

16:23.065 --> 16:27.069
- Wait, let me see that.
Whoa! No way.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.822
They called me a skilled athlete
with a bright future and...

16:29.905 --> 16:30.948
a game changer.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.784
- Did they mention me?
- Not about you, Sawyer.

16:33.867 --> 16:38.080
- They even called
me...Clutch.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.915
- Well, you are a clutch.

16:39.998 --> 16:41.709
How many game-winning
touchdowns have you caught?

16:41.792 --> 16:43.252
- Troy, it's true.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.086
Whenever there is
a game on the line

16:44.169 --> 16:46.088
everyone wants you
to get the ball.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.757
Even me and I'm pretty
good at catching.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.678
- Again, not about
you, Sawyer.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.431
- You know what?
Maybe I am Clutch.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.349
Why did I let this
article get to me?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.601
- It doesn't matter.
You're past that now.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.937
Let's go out there and see
if we can make a comeback.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.690
- That's right.
Let's win this.

17:04.772 --> 17:07.651
- COACH: [chuckles]
- Listen up!

17:07.734 --> 17:12.489
From now on, my nickname isn't
The Troy, it's Clutch Dixon.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.781
Hoorah!

17:13.866 --> 17:17.286
- ALL: Hoorah!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

17:17.368 --> 17:19.121
- It's a good thing
you found that article.

17:19.204 --> 17:19.872
What a stroke of luck.

17:19.954 --> 17:22.290
- It wasn't luck.
It was fake.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.751
I wrote it on the bench, then
screen grabbed their website

17:23.834 --> 17:26.170
and pasted in the new text.

17:26.252 --> 17:28.505
- [chuckling]
Nice work, Newt.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.966
Hoorah!

17:31.049 --> 17:33.093
- I wish someone would write
something nice about me.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.138
- Oh, I forgot to read
this bottom part.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.974
- "Sawyer is a great
player, too."

17:39.057 --> 17:40.893
- I know that was fake.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.186
But still felt good.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.151
- [horn blaring]
- ALL: [gasping]

17:49.234 --> 17:51.695
- Bella!
- Relax, Sophie.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.989
I'm nailing this.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.073
That guy just gave me
a thumbs up.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.701
Hi! [laughing]
- That was a hitchhiker, Bella.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.454
- [horn blaring]
- Ah, watch out!

18:00.537 --> 18:01.663
- [tires screeching]
- Stop it, Sophie!
