00:59.581 --> 01:05.952
Spain, 1944

01:07.155 --> 01:08.523
The Civil War is over.

01:08.523 --> 01:10.659
Hidden in the mountains,

01:10.659 --> 01:12.861
armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.

01:12.861 --> 01:15.125
Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.

01:38.220 --> 01:42.020
A long time ago,

01:44.259 --> 01:49.060
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

01:50.131 --> 01:54.124
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

01:56.137 --> 02:01.336
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

02:06.448 --> 02:07.642
One day,

02:08.383 --> 02:12.012
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

02:16.892 --> 02:19.918
Once outside...

02:20.395 --> 02:24.024
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

02:26.968 --> 02:30.165
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

02:30.639 --> 02:36.874
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

02:38.213 --> 02:40.443
However, her father, the king,

02:40.749 --> 02:43.775
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

02:44.286 --> 02:45.753
perhaps in another body,

02:46.421 --> 02:48.946
in another place, at another time.

02:49.357 --> 02:52.884
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

02:53.228 --> 02:56.527
until the world stopped turning.

03:05.407 --> 03:07.898
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

03:08.076 --> 03:10.670
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

03:16.184 --> 03:17.845
Fairy tales?

03:18.253 --> 03:22.349
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

03:25.427 --> 03:27.327
Ask him to stop the car.

03:41.476 --> 03:44.309
Ofelia, wait.

03:44.512 --> 03:46.605
Your brother's not well.

03:49.784 --> 03:51.376
Madam, are you okay?

04:58.219 --> 04:59.186
Ofelia?

05:01.589 --> 05:04.490
Ofelia, Come here.

05:07.696 --> 05:10.927
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

05:12.167 --> 05:13.156
Let's go.

05:14.302 --> 05:17.203
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

05:17.439 --> 05:19.270
I want you to call him Father.

05:19.708 --> 05:22.142
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

05:23.545 --> 05:26.844
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

05:52.774 --> 05:54.503
They're coming, Captain.

05:55.510 --> 05:57.000
15 minutes late.

06:14.963 --> 06:16.123
Carmen.

06:23.605 --> 06:24.902
Welcome.

06:29.744 --> 06:32.144
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

06:32.614 --> 06:35.082
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

06:35.817 --> 06:36.647
No.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.689
Come.
Do it for me.

06:46.928 --> 06:47.952
Thank you.

06:49.864 --> 06:50.990
Ofelia, come out.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.094
Say hello to the Captain.

06:58.173 --> 06:59.197
Ofelia.

07:07.348 --> 07:09.543
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

07:13.488 --> 07:14.512
Mercedes!

07:15.790 --> 07:18.623
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

08:24.325 --> 08:25.883
It's a labyrinth.

08:29.430 --> 08:31.955
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.258
Even before the mill.

08:35.370 --> 08:38.270
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

08:38.907 --> 08:40.101
Thank you.

08:40.642 --> 08:41.972
Have you read them all?

08:42.477 --> 08:43.409
Mercedes!

08:45.513 --> 08:46.502
The Captain is calling.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.176
Your father needs me.

08:53.121 --> 08:54.247
He's not my father.

08:55.089 --> 08:56.681
The Captain is not my father.

08:56.858 --> 09:00.191
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

09:00.328 --> 09:01.659
He's not my father.

09:03.031 --> 09:05.499
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

09:06.334 --> 09:07.995
Have you seen my mother?

09:08.469 --> 09:10.061
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

09:10.505 --> 09:12.871
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

09:30.725 --> 09:32.522
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

09:32.827 --> 09:34.624
because it's hard
to track them up there.

09:35.830 --> 09:38.094
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

09:38.266 --> 09:39.927
We'll block all access
to the woods

09:41.302 --> 09:44.362
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

09:44.572 --> 09:47.439
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

09:47.775 --> 09:49.504
We'll set up three
new command posts.

09:49.677 --> 09:53.272
Here, here and here.

09:53.448 --> 09:54.472
Mercedes.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.275
- Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
- Yes, sir.

10:02.957 --> 10:05.084
This will help you sleep
through the night.

10:06.394 --> 10:08.885
Just two drops just before bed.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.225
Two drops only.

10:15.770 --> 10:16.600
Very good.

10:18.539 --> 10:20.769
All of it.
Good.

10:23.277 --> 10:26.735
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

10:29.150 --> 10:31.380
You or your nurse.

10:32.186 --> 10:33.175
Good night.

10:34.389 --> 10:36.721
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.865
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

10:51.105 --> 10:54.336
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

10:58.413 --> 11:00.278
This is all I could get.

11:00.515 --> 11:01.504
I'm sorry.

11:03.384 --> 11:05.409
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

11:31.479 --> 11:32.912
Come here, Ofelia.

11:45.126 --> 11:48.357
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

11:58.339 --> 11:59.363
Are you afraid?

12:01.576 --> 12:02.600
A little.

12:07.682 --> 12:08.808
What's that noise?

12:08.916 --> 12:12.010
Nothing, just the wind.

12:13.488 --> 12:16.685
Nights here are different
from city nights.

12:17.625 --> 12:20.651
There, you hear cars-tramway.

12:21.195 --> 12:23.060
Here the houses are old.

12:24.832 --> 12:25.821
They creak.

12:28.402 --> 12:29.767
As if they were speaking.

12:33.808 --> 12:36.242
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

12:37.011 --> 12:38.603
- A surprise?
- Yes.

12:40.148 --> 12:44.585
- A book?
- No, something much better.

12:50.558 --> 12:52.526
Why did you have to get married?

12:56.764 --> 12:59.096
I was alone too long.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.828
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

13:03.871 --> 13:05.361
You were never alone.

13:07.842 --> 13:11.573
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

13:15.216 --> 13:17.150
Your brother's at it again-

13:18.019 --> 13:20.146
Tell him one of your stories.

13:20.688 --> 13:22.383
I'm sure that'll calm down.

13:25.359 --> 13:28.851
My brother, my brother...

13:34.001 --> 13:36.469
Many, many years ago,

13:36.837 --> 13:39.203
in a sad, faraway land,

13:39.307 --> 13:43.038
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

13:43.711 --> 13:45.372
At sunset,

13:46.047 --> 13:48.311
on top of that mountain,

13:48.549 --> 13:52.986
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

13:53.321 --> 13:56.757
But no one dared go near it

13:57.225 --> 14:00.388
because its thorns were full of poison.

14:09.704 --> 14:14.198
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

14:14.275 --> 14:18.905
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

14:22.950 --> 14:30.823
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

14:32.693 --> 14:37.289
Forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

14:37.932 --> 14:41.026
forever alone, until the end of time.

14:53.948 --> 14:54.880
Come in.

14:58.386 --> 15:00.183
- How is she?
- Very weak.

15:00.788 --> 15:02.153
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

15:02.356 --> 15:03.448
I'll sleep down here.

15:08.629 --> 15:10.119
- And my son?
- Pardon?

15:10.431 --> 15:12.262
Excuse us, Captain.

15:14.302 --> 15:16.361
My son, how is he?

15:17.138 --> 15:19.038
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

15:21.242 --> 15:22.140
Very good.

15:24.078 --> 15:29.038
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

15:32.219 --> 15:35.985
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

15:39.160 --> 15:41.594
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

15:42.096 --> 15:43.120
That's all.

15:45.633 --> 15:47.066
One more thing, Captain.

15:48.069 --> 15:50.094
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

15:52.406 --> 15:53.373
Don't fuck with me.

15:55.176 --> 15:57.838
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

15:58.579 --> 15:59.341
Gunfire.

16:02.550 --> 16:05.644
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.351
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

16:08.422 --> 16:10.822
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

16:10.958 --> 16:13.950
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

16:14.962 --> 16:17.624
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

16:17.832 --> 16:19.527
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.158
Again, keep quiet.

16:31.846 --> 16:33.507
"No God, no country, no Master"?

16:33.981 --> 16:38.111
- Just like that-how do you like that?
- Red prpaganda, Captain.

16:38.252 --> 16:40.049
It's not propaganda, sir.

16:40.755 --> 16:43.053
It's an old almanac, Captain.

16:44.091 --> 16:45.752
We're just farmers.

16:47.361 --> 16:48.191
Go on.

16:49.430 --> 16:53.196
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.961
For my daughters. They're sick.

16:57.571 --> 16:59.038
Rabbits, uh?

16:59.440 --> 17:03.240
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

17:14.622 --> 17:16.317
Leave him alone.

17:19.260 --> 17:22.525
You killed him,
You killed him!

17:23.030 --> 17:26.021
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

17:55.796 --> 17:57.957
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

17:58.232 --> 17:59.790
before you come bothering me.

18:00.067 --> 18:01.227
Yes, Captain.

18:21.489 --> 18:24.925
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

18:25.426 --> 18:28.691
Mother, there's something in the room.

19:10.104 --> 19:11.036
Hello.

19:11.906 --> 19:13.430
Did you follow me here?

19:14.208 --> 19:15.368
Are you a fairy?

19:17.845 --> 19:18.709
Look!

19:24.051 --> 19:25.541
This is a fairy.

19:53.347 --> 19:55.008
You want me to go with you?

19:56.617 --> 19:59.051
Outside? Where?

21:17.064 --> 21:18.725
Hello?

21:20.100 --> 21:21.624
Hello?

21:39.687 --> 21:41.780
Echo.

21:48.796 --> 21:50.821
Echo.

21:53.701 --> 21:55.794
Hello?

21:58.639 --> 22:00.163
Hello?

22:02.776 --> 22:04.073
It's you.

22:09.216 --> 22:12.549
It's you.
You've returned.

22:12.653 --> 22:14.678
Don't be frightened,
I beg you.

22:16.023 --> 22:17.957
Look, look.

22:26.233 --> 22:28.861
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

22:29.002 --> 22:30.162
Me?

22:32.740 --> 22:35.208
I've had so many names...

22:35.409 --> 22:43.407
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

22:43.584 --> 22:50.422
I am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

22:51.225 --> 22:52.522
I am...

22:55.996 --> 22:58.794
I am a faun.

22:59.566 --> 23:03.593
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

23:03.737 --> 23:07.366
- No, I'm...
- You're Princess Moanna,

23:07.474 --> 23:13.140
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

23:13.213 --> 23:14.942
My father was a tailor.

23:15.048 --> 23:17.175
You are not born of man.

23:18.218 --> 23:20.652
It was the moon that bore you.

23:20.821 --> 23:23.119
Look on your left shoulder

23:23.290 --> 23:26.259
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

23:26.693 --> 23:36.659
Your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

23:37.137 --> 23:38.798
This is...

23:39.439 --> 23:42.033
This is the last of them.

23:42.676 --> 23:51.277
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

23:51.785 --> 23:55.915
that you have not become a mortal.

23:59.493 --> 24:05.125
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

24:08.068 --> 24:14.098
This is The Book of Crossroads.

24:14.808 --> 24:17.936
Open it, when you are alone

24:18.078 --> 24:20.979
and it will show you your future,

24:21.081 --> 24:25.415
show you what must be done.

24:33.794 --> 24:35.352
But there's nothing in here.

25:32.319 --> 25:35.880
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

25:36.890 --> 25:38.915
They are too young.

25:39.426 --> 25:42.486
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

25:44.965 --> 25:47.957
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

25:56.410 --> 25:59.243
You should keep an eye on it.

26:01.048 --> 26:02.481
As you wish, sir.

26:09.022 --> 26:10.011
Cook these.

26:11.792 --> 26:14.260
- He didn't like the coffee.
- He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

26:14.394 --> 26:15.295
A fussy dandy!

26:15.295 --> 26:17.597
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

26:17.597 --> 26:21.431
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

26:21.501 --> 26:24.493
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

26:25.605 --> 26:29.166
- And they don't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

26:44.124 --> 26:46.149
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

26:51.264 --> 26:52.526
Ofelia.

26:55.102 --> 26:57.832
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

26:58.238 --> 27:01.071
Look what I've made for you.

27:02.509 --> 27:03.703
Do you like it?

27:05.512 --> 27:08.504
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

27:08.648 --> 27:11.082
as fine as this when I was your age!

27:11.251 --> 27:12.377
And look at the shoes!

27:13.754 --> 27:16.450
- Do you like them?
- Yes, very pretty.

27:18.091 --> 27:19.752
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

28:24.124 --> 28:25.113
Ofelia?

28:26.893 --> 28:27.757
Ofelia?

28:29.196 --> 28:32.654
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

28:32.933 --> 28:35.493
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

28:38.338 --> 28:40.101
You'll look like a princess.

28:44.511 --> 28:45.910
A princess?

28:52.252 --> 28:53.981
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

28:54.087 --> 28:56.555
And don't forget the beans.

28:59.793 --> 29:04.162
- You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

29:06.600 --> 29:09.091
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

29:11.905 --> 29:13.372
Do you want some milk with honey?

29:18.912 --> 29:22.871
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

29:25.252 --> 29:29.188
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

29:30.323 --> 29:31.221
No.

29:32.025 --> 29:33.390
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

29:33.460 --> 29:36.054
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

29:38.465 --> 29:40.194
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

29:41.201 --> 29:42.259
Really?

29:43.503 --> 29:46.640
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

29:46.640 --> 29:48.335
- And a faun, too.
- A faun?

29:48.608 --> 29:52.567
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

29:53.613 --> 29:56.639
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

29:56.883 --> 29:57.941
Mercedes!

29:59.886 --> 30:00.853
Come with me.

30:11.531 --> 30:13.328
Captain,
everything is here.

30:13.567 --> 30:16.263
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

30:16.436 --> 30:19.564
olives, bacon.

30:20.674 --> 30:22.539
This-this is real tobacco.

30:23.510 --> 30:24.909
And the ration cards.

30:25.278 --> 30:27.610
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

30:31.084 --> 30:32.108
Mercedes.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.015
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

30:42.362 --> 30:44.296
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

30:44.397 --> 30:46.194
From now on, I'll carry it.

30:47.133 --> 30:48.065
Captain.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.432
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

31:03.850 --> 31:04.839
It's them.

31:16.529 --> 31:20.590
"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

31:21.167 --> 31:26.799
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

31:33.613 --> 31:35.945
"They protected one another,

31:36.249 --> 31:39.412
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

31:39.853 --> 31:42.287
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

31:44.824 --> 31:46.587
"But now, the tree is dying.

31:46.926 --> 31:50.589
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

31:51.398 --> 31:54.629
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

31:54.901 --> 31:56.368
and won't let the tree thrive.

31:57.671 --> 32:00.868
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

32:01.541 --> 32:04.999
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

32:05.612 --> 32:08.775
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

33:35.301 --> 33:37.098
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

33:37.904 --> 33:39.735
They left in a hurry.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.780
A dozen men, at most.

34:07.700 --> 34:09.065
Antibiotics.

34:10.036 --> 34:13.199
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

34:15.542 --> 34:16.735
They're here.

34:19.712 --> 34:22.078
Those sons of bitches are here.

34:22.949 --> 34:25.076
And they're watching us.

34:35.027 --> 34:36.723
Hey!

34:38.063 --> 34:40.554
You left this behind!

34:41.301 --> 34:43.292
And your lottery ticket!

34:43.837 --> 34:45.929
Why don't you come back
and get it?

34:46.672 --> 34:49.141
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

36:00.280 --> 36:03.841
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna,

36:04.217 --> 36:05.684
and I'm not afraid of you.

36:09.155 --> 36:12.386
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

36:12.592 --> 36:14.617
eating all these bugs...

36:15.395 --> 36:18.330
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

39:01.227 --> 39:03.252
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

39:03.396 --> 39:04.658
Yes, ma'am.

39:08.267 --> 39:09.859
Have you checked the garden?

39:10.203 --> 39:12.000
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

39:12.839 --> 39:14.431
Where is that girl?

39:14.507 --> 39:15.804
This way, please.

39:16.843 --> 39:19.835
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

39:21.714 --> 39:23.579
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

39:24.183 --> 39:27.482
From now on,
one ration card per family.

39:28.254 --> 39:29.221
Take a look.

39:29.355 --> 39:31.550
- One?
- Only one.

39:32.325 --> 39:34.122
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

39:34.193 --> 39:35.524
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

39:35.595 --> 39:38.792
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

39:38.931 --> 39:42.799
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

39:43.669 --> 39:46.405
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

39:46.405 --> 39:49.135
We almost got them.
We found this.

39:49.942 --> 39:51.170
Antibiotics.

39:52.411 --> 39:54.777
God has already
saved their souls.

39:55.047 --> 39:57.675
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

39:57.850 --> 40:00.341
We'll help however we can, Captain.

40:00.453 --> 40:02.614
We know you're not here by choice.

40:06.993 --> 40:08.051
You're wrong about that.

40:09.262 --> 40:13.130
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

40:14.100 --> 40:17.194
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

40:17.470 --> 40:19.028
that we're all equal.

40:19.639 --> 40:21.106
But there's a big difference:

40:21.707 --> 40:24.232
The war is over and we won.

40:24.844 --> 40:27.779
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

40:28.781 --> 40:30.942
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

40:32.185 --> 40:33.709
We're all here by choice.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.915
By choice!

40:39.826 --> 40:42.624
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

40:42.762 --> 40:44.753
We'll take care of it.

41:11.757 --> 41:12.883
Ofelia?

41:24.904 --> 41:27.771
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

41:30.209 --> 41:33.007
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

41:33.145 --> 41:34.112
Oh, I see...

41:34.647 --> 41:38.845
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

41:38.985 --> 41:41.180
A little more than a year ago,

41:42.088 --> 41:45.888
the Captain and I met again.

41:46.058 --> 41:47.548
Curious, isn't it!

41:47.827 --> 41:50.796
I mean, finding each other again?

41:52.331 --> 41:54.993
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

41:55.268 --> 41:58.965
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

41:59.472 --> 42:01.702
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

42:02.875 --> 42:04.399
We understand.

42:06.812 --> 42:08.973
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

42:09.715 --> 42:11.114
Excuse me.

42:22.061 --> 42:24.256
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

42:25.431 --> 42:26.898
No.
I had no idea.

42:29.635 --> 42:31.125
In Morocco.

42:31.537 --> 42:34.506
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

42:34.573 --> 42:35.767
An excellent soldier.

42:36.242 --> 42:40.542
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

42:41.347 --> 42:43.008
he smashed his watch on a rock

42:43.215 --> 42:45.706
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

42:46.819 --> 42:49.151
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

42:52.224 --> 42:54.749
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

42:56.362 --> 42:59.559
What you've done hurts me.

43:01.100 --> 43:03.694
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

43:05.705 --> 43:06.797
Are you listening?

43:10.276 --> 43:13.040
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

43:13.913 --> 43:15.904
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

43:17.984 --> 43:19.383
And your father, too.

43:20.853 --> 43:22.115
You mean the Captain?

43:23.255 --> 43:24.552
Him more than me.

43:40.006 --> 43:41.439
I've got the key.

43:45.177 --> 43:46.804
Take me to the Labyrinth.

44:40.066 --> 44:41.055
Hello.

44:42.868 --> 44:44.665
I got the key out.

44:45.738 --> 44:50.607
That's me,
and the girl is you.

44:50.943 --> 44:52.137
And the baby?

44:53.512 --> 44:55.742
So... you retrieved the key.

44:58.517 --> 44:59.779
I'm glad.

45:08.427 --> 45:12.727
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

45:13.099 --> 45:15.795
She's so glad you succeeded.

45:21.841 --> 45:23.240
Keep the key.

45:23.676 --> 45:26.839
You'll be needing it very soon.

45:27.012 --> 45:31.915
And this too?
A piece of chalk.

45:33.352 --> 45:36.622
Two tasks remain

45:36.622 --> 45:41.457
and the moon is almost full.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.357
Be patient.

45:43.629 --> 45:52.333
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

45:52.438 --> 45:54.963
How do I know
that what you say is true?

45:55.274 --> 46:01.213
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

46:23.335 --> 46:24.529
Proceed.

46:25.571 --> 46:28.005
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.800
Let's go.
Your name?

46:34.547 --> 46:36.037
Your names, first and last.

46:36.515 --> 46:40.679
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

46:44.190 --> 46:46.420
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

46:46.659 --> 46:50.755
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

46:51.130 --> 46:52.791
because in a united Spain,

46:52.965 --> 46:56.662
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

47:10.883 --> 47:14.444
Come on, show me
what happens now?

47:14.954 --> 47:15.978
Show me.

47:54.026 --> 47:55.618
Ofelia, help me...

48:01.467 --> 48:03.332
Captain! Captain!

48:05.904 --> 48:07.462
Come quickly.

48:08.007 --> 48:09.304
...because in a united Spain,

48:09.408 --> 48:13.276
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

48:13.746 --> 48:16.078
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

48:18.984 --> 48:21.953
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

48:23.822 --> 48:26.723
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

48:28.961 --> 48:31.293
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

48:33.065 --> 48:35.124
I'll stay here until the birth.

48:35.601 --> 48:36.568
Make her well.

48:37.903 --> 48:39.928
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

48:44.643 --> 48:45.337
Make her well.

49:06.665 --> 49:08.132
Don't worry.

49:09.301 --> 49:11.792
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

49:15.174 --> 49:16.801
Having a baby is complicated.

49:17.609 --> 49:20.772
Then I'll never have one.

49:33.325 --> 49:36.158
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

49:47.806 --> 49:49.137
Have you told anyone?

49:50.709 --> 49:51.835
No, I haven't.

49:54.046 --> 49:56.139
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

50:07.059 --> 50:08.321
Nor I to you.

50:09.862 --> 50:11.989
Do you know a lullaby?

50:13.966 --> 50:15.194
Only one...

50:16.335 --> 50:18.360
but I don't remember the words.

50:18.670 --> 50:22.265
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

51:15.627 --> 51:18.391
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

51:27.339 --> 51:29.307
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

51:30.476 --> 51:31.602
Then let's go.

51:36.615 --> 51:38.082
This is sheer madness.

51:38.450 --> 51:40.884
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

51:41.386 --> 51:44.514
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

51:44.923 --> 51:46.891
It's not fear...

51:47.493 --> 51:48.858
at least not for myself.

52:00.639 --> 52:02.038
Pedro!

52:02.341 --> 52:04.775
Pedro, My brother!

52:21.426 --> 52:23.587
You didn't carry out the task.

52:23.729 --> 52:27.028
No, my mother is sick.

52:28.567 --> 52:31.161
That's no excuse
for negligence.

52:31.436 --> 52:36.305
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

52:36.408 --> 52:40.276
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

52:41.213 --> 52:45.877
Put it under your mother's bed

52:46.251 --> 52:49.482
in a bowl of fresh milk.

52:50.088 --> 52:55.048
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

52:55.494 --> 52:59.555
Now, we have no time
to waste.

52:59.865 --> 53:02.629
The full moon will be upon us.

53:05.003 --> 53:07.471
Take my pets
to guide you through.

53:08.073 --> 53:13.670
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

53:13.879 --> 53:16.643
The thing that slumbers there,

53:17.549 --> 53:20.074
it is not human.

53:23.922 --> 53:28.188
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

53:28.293 --> 53:31.091
but don't eat
or drink anything.

53:31.296 --> 53:36.029
Absolutely nothing.

53:37.703 --> 53:41.230
Your life depends on it.

54:01.893 --> 54:06.853
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

54:07.566 --> 54:09.932
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

54:12.004 --> 54:13.972
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

54:14.539 --> 54:17.975
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

54:18.443 --> 54:20.035
Let's see.

54:23.115 --> 54:26.380
...N- North American,

54:27.753 --> 54:30.415
British and Canadian troops

54:30.522 --> 54:34.049
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

54:34.893 --> 54:37.589
- "France", idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

54:37.996 --> 54:40.487
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

54:40.732 --> 54:45.533
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

54:45.737 --> 54:48.706
Is it really bad, doctor?

54:49.741 --> 54:51.368
Look, Frenchie.

54:52.644 --> 54:54.202
There's no way to save it.

55:06.091 --> 55:09.390
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

55:17.169 --> 55:20.570
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

55:55.674 --> 56:01.840
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

56:07.018 --> 56:10.977
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

56:13.291 --> 56:15.418
"Let the fairies guide you."

56:20.799 --> 56:24.132
"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

56:24.369 --> 56:28.931
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls."

58:37.903 --> 58:38.927
No...

58:41.773 --> 58:42.967
This other one.

01:01:18.863 --> 01:01:20.490
No! No!

01:02:36.307 --> 01:02:38.207
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

01:02:38.643 --> 01:02:42.545
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

01:02:43.581 --> 01:02:46.072
And then what?

01:02:46.784 --> 01:02:50.481
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

01:02:51.055 --> 01:02:54.286
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

01:02:54.392 --> 01:02:58.624
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

01:02:58.863 --> 01:03:00.592
If you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

01:03:00.665 --> 01:03:03.099
- This is a lost cause.
- I'm staying here, doctor.

01:03:03.434 --> 01:03:04.401
There's no choice.

01:03:16.814 --> 01:03:17.974
You have to leave.

01:03:19.751 --> 01:03:22.686
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

01:03:22.954 --> 01:03:25.184
It's exactly what he expects.

01:03:28.359 --> 01:03:29.326
Leave it to me.

01:03:33.398 --> 01:03:34.524
I'm a coward.

01:03:35.633 --> 01:03:38.158
No, you're not.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.565
Yes, I am.

01:03:41.206 --> 01:03:45.643
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

01:03:46.945 --> 01:03:49.743
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

01:03:53.451 --> 01:03:55.942
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

01:04:00.258 --> 01:04:02.488
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:58.342
Captain Vidal...

01:06:00.445 --> 01:06:02.970
Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.

01:06:03.781 --> 01:06:04.713
But she still has a fever?

01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:08.251
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

01:06:10.054 --> 01:06:11.021
Listen to me.

01:06:11.689 --> 01:06:14.715
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:17.417
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

01:06:17.562 --> 01:06:18.551
Save him.

01:06:54.565 --> 01:06:55.532
Brother...

01:06:57.535 --> 01:06:58.467
Little brother...

01:07:00.705 --> 01:07:02.229
If you can hear me,

01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:05.502
things out here aren't too good.

01:07:07.378 --> 01:07:09.369
But soon you'll have to come out.

01:07:10.648 --> 01:07:12.275
You've made Mama very sick.

01:07:14.485 --> 01:07:18.114
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

01:07:19.257 --> 01:07:20.383
just one:

01:07:21.726 --> 01:07:23.387
Don't hurt her.

01:07:24.595 --> 01:07:27.826
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

01:07:28.666 --> 01:07:30.930
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

01:07:32.036 --> 01:07:33.901
You'll see, when she smiles,

01:07:35.506 --> 01:07:36.996
you'll love her.

01:07:39.377 --> 01:07:42.676
Listen, if you do what I say,

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:44.538
I'll make you a promise,

01:07:45.483 --> 01:07:49.112
I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

01:07:50.121 --> 01:07:53.284
I promise you, a prince.

01:08:19.951 --> 01:08:22.475
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

01:08:22.687 --> 01:08:25.087
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

01:08:25.156 --> 01:08:27.590
The fireman and I
jumped out just in time,

01:08:27.825 --> 01:08:29.224
but look at the mess they made.

01:08:32.395 --> 01:08:34.125
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

01:08:34.631 --> 01:08:36.429
They didn't open a single one.

01:08:36.701 --> 01:08:38.134
What the hell are you talking about?

01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:40.567
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:45.071
- They didn't take anything.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

01:08:45.443 --> 01:08:49.310
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

01:09:06.162 --> 01:09:07.926
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:14.432
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

01:09:19.143 --> 01:09:21.941
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

01:09:22.179 --> 01:09:23.770
They took cover up on the hill.

01:09:58.849 --> 01:10:03.343
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

01:10:47.064 --> 01:10:48.258
Serrano!

01:11:05.483 --> 01:11:08.509
Let me see.

01:11:13.257 --> 01:11:14.349
Can you talk?

01:11:18.763 --> 01:11:19.730
Damn it!

01:11:38.315 --> 01:11:40.909
These are useless! They can't talk.

01:11:50.227 --> 01:11:52.889
Captain,
this one's still alive.

01:11:56.967 --> 01:11:58.332
Shot in the leg.

01:12:04.275 --> 01:12:05.640
- What's happened?
- They caught one.

01:12:05.743 --> 01:12:08.109
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

01:12:13.317 --> 01:12:14.443
Mercedes!

01:12:15.286 --> 01:12:17.516
Pedro... Pedro...

01:12:34.972 --> 01:12:35.939
Mercedes?

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:39.866
- I need to get into the storeroom.
- Not now.

01:12:40.377 --> 01:12:41.708
Move away!

01:13:08.806 --> 01:13:11.036
That's plenty, dear.

01:13:14.612 --> 01:13:16.102
Should I take this up?

01:13:35.966 --> 01:13:38.434
Here, half the dose.

01:13:38.936 --> 01:13:40.733
I don't think I need it.

01:13:41.038 --> 01:13:44.030
I feel better, much better.

01:13:44.308 --> 01:13:46.708
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

01:13:50.047 --> 01:13:50.638
Mother...

01:14:05.396 --> 01:14:08.160
Damn, this cigarette is good!

01:14:08.933 --> 01:14:12.334
Real tobacco hard to find.

01:14:13.971 --> 01:14:16.371
G-G-Go to hell.

01:14:19.043 --> 01:14:23.036
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

01:14:23.314 --> 01:14:25.441
We'll be here all night.

01:14:25.649 --> 01:14:27.617
As long as he talks.

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:35.321
Garces is right.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.458
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

01:14:39.163 --> 01:14:42.530
But to make sure it happens,
I brought along a few tools.

01:14:44.869 --> 01:14:47.064
Just things you pick up
along the way.

01:14:47.271 --> 01:14:49.705
At first, I won't be able to trust you,

01:14:50.274 --> 01:14:53.732
but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

01:14:55.779 --> 01:14:57.246
When we get to these,

01:14:58.282 --> 01:15:01.945
we'll have developed...
how can I put this-?

01:15:02.353 --> 01:15:04.947
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:07.914
You'll see.

01:15:09.927 --> 01:15:11.588
And when we get to this one,

01:15:12.963 --> 01:15:15.397
I'll believe anything you tell me.

01:15:27.711 --> 01:15:29.008
I'll make you a deal.

01:15:29.079 --> 01:15:32.606
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.144
you can go.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.255
Don't look at him, look at me.

01:15:39.523 --> 01:15:41.286
Above me, there's no one.

01:15:41.825 --> 01:15:43.725
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

01:15:43.994 --> 01:15:47.521
If I say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

01:15:47.598 --> 01:15:49.225
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

01:15:49.967 --> 01:15:54.097
There you have it.
Count to three.

01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:13.115
- One.
- Good.

01:16:17.361 --> 01:16:18.328
Two.

01:16:20.097 --> 01:16:22.998
One more and you will be free.

01:16:39.917 --> 01:16:40.884
Shame.

01:16:52.796 --> 01:16:56.823
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

01:16:58.268 --> 01:17:04.332
Surely, you must be relieved.

01:17:04.842 --> 01:17:06.935
Yes, thank you.

01:17:07.344 --> 01:17:10.802
But things haven't turned out so well.

01:17:11.715 --> 01:17:12.807
No?

01:17:14.618 --> 01:17:18.247
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

01:17:18.422 --> 01:17:19.389
Yes.

01:17:28.665 --> 01:17:31.566
- You broke the rules!
- It was only two grapes!

01:17:31.668 --> 01:17:33.260
I thought no one would notice.

01:17:34.671 --> 01:17:37.765
- We've made a mistake!
- A mistake?

01:17:38.509 --> 01:17:42.240
You failed.
You can never return.

01:17:42.346 --> 01:17:46.009
- It was an accident!
- You cannot return.

01:17:46.116 --> 01:17:50.075
The moon will be full in three days.

01:17:50.654 --> 01:17:56.354
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

01:17:56.460 --> 01:18:00.328
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

01:18:00.397 --> 01:18:04.493
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

01:18:05.069 --> 01:18:09.062
And we'll vanish along with it.

01:18:09.706 --> 01:18:13.506
You will never see us again.

01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:27.952
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

01:18:28.692 --> 01:18:30.421
but I think we need your help.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:55.308
My God, what have you done to him?

01:18:55.486 --> 01:18:56.612
Not much.

01:18:58.555 --> 01:19:00.352
But things are getting better.

01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:12.998
I like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.

01:19:14.538 --> 01:19:16.005
Serrano, stay here.

01:19:16.173 --> 01:19:17.231
I talked.

01:19:18.642 --> 01:19:19.870
Not much.

01:19:22.246 --> 01:19:25.682
- B-b-but I talked.
- I'm sorry.

01:19:26.416 --> 01:19:28.008
I'm so sorry.

01:19:35.159 --> 01:19:40.290
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.072
Son of a bitch.

01:20:19.169 --> 01:20:21.103
It'll take away the pain.

01:20:27.477 --> 01:20:28.944
It's almost over.

01:20:37.688 --> 01:20:39.019
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:40.623
- I'll be right there.
- Yes, Captain.

01:21:04.181 --> 01:21:05.773
You're not moving anymore.

01:21:07.284 --> 01:21:08.717
Are you sick?

01:21:11.922 --> 01:21:14.447
What are you doing down there?

01:21:28.038 --> 01:21:29.699
- Call him!
- Who?

01:21:29.806 --> 01:21:32.206
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.393
What the hell is this?

01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:03.063
No! No, no!

01:22:03.307 --> 01:22:06.902
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

01:22:08.612 --> 01:22:11.172
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:12.775
What do you think of this?

01:22:17.387 --> 01:22:21.881
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

01:22:22.092 --> 01:22:26.028
It's a magic root
the faun gave me.

01:22:26.196 --> 01:22:28.790
This is all because of that junk
you let her read.

01:22:29.132 --> 01:22:30.099
Look what you've done!

01:22:30.233 --> 01:22:34.294
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

01:22:34.938 --> 01:22:37.873
Fine.
As you wish.

01:22:39.676 --> 01:22:42.372
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

01:22:42.646 --> 01:22:45.547
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

01:22:46.883 --> 01:22:47.975
You have to stop all this.

01:22:48.652 --> 01:22:51.280
No. I want to leave this place!

01:22:51.621 --> 01:22:54.784
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

01:22:54.925 --> 01:22:57.223
Things are not that simple.

01:22:59.463 --> 01:23:01.294
You're getting older,

01:23:02.332 --> 01:23:05.699
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

01:23:06.303 --> 01:23:08.498
The world is a cruel place.

01:23:09.873 --> 01:23:13.604
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

01:23:15.212 --> 01:23:17.737
- No! No!
- Ofelia!

01:23:19.082 --> 01:23:24.042
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

01:23:35.866 --> 01:23:38.130
Mom! Help!

01:23:38.602 --> 01:23:40.035
Help!

01:23:40.904 --> 01:23:42.166
Help!

01:23:48.211 --> 01:23:49.178
Why did you do it?

01:23:51.515 --> 01:23:53.176
It was the only thing I could do.

01:23:54.518 --> 01:23:56.748
No. You could have obeyed me.

01:23:58.522 --> 01:24:00.786
I could have, but I didn't.

01:24:02.726 --> 01:24:05.251
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

01:24:06.663 --> 01:24:09.632
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

01:24:09.933 --> 01:24:16.065
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:20.800
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

01:24:58.248 --> 01:24:59.579
Captain!

01:25:05.889 --> 01:25:08.255
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:10.949
- Get up immediately!
- Yes, Captain.

01:25:45.595 --> 01:25:47.460
Your wife is dead.

01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.632
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

01:26:01.111 --> 01:26:02.976
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

01:26:03.046 --> 01:26:06.379
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:10.242
Because although God
sends us the message,

01:26:10.387 --> 01:26:13.015
it is our task to decipher it.

01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:15.721
Because when we open our arms

01:26:15.892 --> 01:26:20.761
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

01:26:22.132 --> 01:26:25.067
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:29.332
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.075
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

01:26:34.411 --> 01:26:39.678
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

01:26:43.753 --> 01:26:46.244
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

01:26:46.423 --> 01:26:50.689
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:16.141
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.155
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

01:27:22.125 --> 01:27:25.754
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:30.798
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

01:27:32.636 --> 01:27:36.072
Mercedes, please.

01:27:45.815 --> 01:27:47.248
What must you think of me?

01:27:48.518 --> 01:27:50.110
You must think that
I'm a monster.

01:27:50.654 --> 01:27:53.555
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

01:28:03.733 --> 01:28:06.634
I want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

01:28:06.903 --> 01:28:10.100
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

01:28:10.674 --> 01:28:14.633
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

01:28:15.679 --> 01:28:16.668
Sir?

01:28:21.718 --> 01:28:22.616
The key.

01:28:23.653 --> 01:28:25.985
I do have the only copy, don't I?

01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:28.179
Yes, sir.

01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:33.719
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

01:28:34.064 --> 01:28:35.998
Maybe it's not important, but...

01:28:36.266 --> 01:28:37.858
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

01:28:38.101 --> 01:28:40.433
with all those grenades
and explosives,

01:28:41.337 --> 01:28:42.827
the lock itself wasn't forced.

01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:48.736
As I said, it's probably
not important.

01:28:52.348 --> 01:28:53.645
Be very careful.

01:28:55.752 --> 01:28:56.980
Good night, sir.

01:29:39.829 --> 01:29:42.593
Ofelia, Ofelia!

01:29:42.866 --> 01:29:44.891
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

01:29:45.435 --> 01:29:48.927
- Where to?
- I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

01:29:49.038 --> 01:29:52.064
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

01:29:52.175 --> 01:29:55.201
I can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

01:29:55.345 --> 01:29:56.471
Take me with you.

01:30:21.371 --> 01:30:22.668
I heard something.

01:30:27.644 --> 01:30:30.807
It's nothing, don't worry.

01:30:40.156 --> 01:30:41.145
Mercedes.

01:30:43.326 --> 01:30:44.293
Ofelia.

01:30:53.303 --> 01:30:54.930
How long have
you known about her?

01:31:00.343 --> 01:31:01.901
How long have you been
laughing at me?

01:31:02.145 --> 01:31:03.339
Little bitch!

01:31:04.681 --> 01:31:05.943
Watch her!

01:31:09.419 --> 01:31:11.148
And if anyone tries to get in,

01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:13.713
kill her first.

01:31:28.037 --> 01:31:29.004
Dry meat.

01:31:32.609 --> 01:31:33.598
Tobacco.

01:31:34.911 --> 01:31:37.675
If you had asked for it, I would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

01:31:44.888 --> 01:31:47.118
I want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

01:31:48.858 --> 01:31:51.019
And I want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

01:31:51.394 --> 01:31:52.418
Yes, Captain.

01:31:55.298 --> 01:31:56.765
You can go, Garces.

01:31:58.334 --> 01:31:59.733
You're sure, Captain?

01:32:02.171 --> 01:32:04.935
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

01:32:08.912 --> 01:32:11.073
That's what you've always thought.

01:32:12.248 --> 01:32:15.046
That's why I was able to get away with it.

01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:19.949
- I was invisible to you.
- Damn.

01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:24.590
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

01:32:25.995 --> 01:32:29.328
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

01:32:31.701 --> 01:32:34.636
It's very simple: You will talk...

01:32:36.339 --> 01:32:37.363
And I have to know

01:32:39.342 --> 01:32:40.639
that everything you say is the truth.

01:32:41.878 --> 01:32:46.144
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

01:32:48.084 --> 01:32:49.346
Nothing complicated.

01:32:52.188 --> 01:32:53.712
Things we learn on the job.

01:32:55.825 --> 01:32:57.793
At first...

01:33:14.911 --> 01:33:18.142
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

01:33:18.214 --> 01:33:22.275
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

01:33:22.518 --> 01:33:24.281
Won't be the first pig I gutted.

01:33:47.777 --> 01:33:48.869
Look! He let her go.

01:33:51.381 --> 01:33:52.678
The fuck did you say?

01:34:00.690 --> 01:34:03.386
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

01:34:03.826 --> 01:34:05.657
Bring her to me, damn it!

01:34:05.795 --> 01:34:07.285
Mount up!

01:35:10.226 --> 01:35:12.717
It'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

01:35:13.362 --> 01:35:15.387
The Captain said that if you behave...

01:35:20.036 --> 01:35:21.799
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

01:35:22.171 --> 01:35:23.729
If anyone's going to kill you...

01:35:25.842 --> 01:35:27.036
I'd rather it be me.

01:36:37.588 --> 01:36:42.525
I've decided to give you
one last chance.

01:36:47.798 --> 01:36:49.493
Do you promise to do what I say?

01:36:51.502 --> 01:36:55.734
Will you do everything I tell you,
without question?

01:36:57.541 --> 01:37:00.510
This is your last chance.

01:37:01.645 --> 01:37:04.773
Then listen to me.

01:37:05.216 --> 01:37:07.616
Fetch your brother

01:37:08.018 --> 01:37:10.680
and bring him to the labyrinth,

01:37:10.821 --> 01:37:15.224
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

01:37:15.459 --> 01:37:16.790
My brother?

01:37:17.027 --> 01:37:18.358
We need him.

01:37:18.496 --> 01:37:21.556
- But...
- No more questions.

01:37:24.568 --> 01:37:26.126
The door's locked.

01:37:27.138 --> 01:37:33.043
In that case,
create your own door.

01:40:21.679 --> 01:40:23.112
Captain, with your permission.

01:40:26.483 --> 01:40:27.507
Come quickly.

01:40:28.285 --> 01:40:31.550
- Now what?
- Serrano is back. He's wounded.

01:40:32.523 --> 01:40:33.888
Wounded?

01:41:20.104 --> 01:41:21.503
Where's Garces?

01:41:28.979 --> 01:41:29.968
How many were there?

01:41:30.514 --> 01:41:32.744
I don't know exactly, Captain.

01:41:33.183 --> 01:41:34.673
Fifty men, at least.

01:41:34.785 --> 01:41:38.380
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

01:41:38.522 --> 01:41:42.117
- How many men we have left?
- Twenty, maybe less, sir.

01:41:52.936 --> 01:41:56.303
We're leaving.
Together.

01:41:57.341 --> 01:41:58.603
Don't be afraid.

01:41:59.476 --> 01:42:01.137
Nothing is going to happen to you.

01:42:07.518 --> 01:42:09.145
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

01:42:09.286 --> 01:42:11.413
If the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

01:42:11.655 --> 01:42:15.147
Radio for reinforcements, now.

01:42:15.325 --> 01:42:16.622
Yes, Captain.

01:42:43.454 --> 01:42:44.682
Leave him!

01:43:30.768 --> 01:43:32.030
Ofelia!

01:44:59.189 --> 01:45:01.885
Quickly, Your Majesty,

01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:04.684
give him to me.

01:45:05.229 --> 01:45:08.323
The full moon is high in the sky,

01:45:08.432 --> 01:45:11.265
we can open the portal.

01:45:12.169 --> 01:45:13.796
Why is that in your hand?

01:45:15.305 --> 01:45:20.208
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:24.947
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

01:45:25.048 --> 01:45:27.642
It's the final task.

01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:29.282
Hurry.

01:45:31.989 --> 01:45:35.083
You promised to obey me!

01:45:35.525 --> 01:45:37.755
- Give me the boy!
- No!

01:45:38.362 --> 01:45:40.489
My brother stays with me.

01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:46.636
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

01:45:46.703 --> 01:45:49.501
Yes, I would.

01:45:50.807 --> 01:45:53.275
You would give up
your throne for him?

01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:58.006
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

01:45:58.548 --> 01:46:01.415
Yes, I would.

01:46:05.522 --> 01:46:11.222
As you wish, Your Highness.

01:46:26.944 --> 01:46:27.968
No!

01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:27.659
My son.

01:47:55.265 --> 01:47:56.926
Tell my son...

01:48:02.773 --> 01:48:04.866
Tell him what time his father died.

01:48:05.675 --> 01:48:06.972
- Tell him that I...
- No.

01:48:08.178 --> 01:48:09.941
He won't even know your name.

01:49:52.782 --> 01:49:54.807
Arise, my daughter.

01:49:58.121 --> 01:49:59.383
Come.

01:50:25.615 --> 01:50:26.843
Father.

01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:30.979
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

01:50:31.755 --> 01:50:35.589
That was the final task,
and the most important.

01:50:46.102 --> 01:50:51.369
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

01:50:51.608 --> 01:50:53.269
Come here with me,

01:50:54.144 --> 01:50:56.271
and sit by your father's side.

01:50:56.746 --> 01:50:58.941
He's been waiting for you so long.

01:51:51.868 --> 01:51:55.634
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

01:51:56.573 --> 01:52:01.909
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

01:52:02.812 --> 01:52:05.076
That she was loved by her people.

01:52:05.348 --> 01:52:10.047
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,

01:52:11.154 --> 01:52:15.989
visible only to those
who know where to look.
