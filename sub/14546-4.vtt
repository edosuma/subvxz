appear in her mouth

18:40.661 --> 18:43.122
which you can see is empty.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.958
Dalia, no! The kugel
is a gateway kugel.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.877
- Immobulus!
- Dalia, I know you're hurting.

18:48.919 --> 18:49.920
Okay?

18:49.962 --> 18:52.422
I know that Wan'Er isn't really

18:52.464 --> 18:55.425
your BFF and I know
you're not gonna be

18:55.467 --> 18:56.760
the maid of honor
at their wedding.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.930
- They eloped without me.
- I know.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.183
I'm sorry, but..

19:03.225 --> 19:06.228
...Evan is not the answer.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.188
If daddy and Wan'Er
don't want me

19:08.230 --> 19:10.732
and mommy's
with that greasy hobo

19:10.774 --> 19:13.360
then maybe my place is here,
with Evan.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.779
mensch.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.407
We're probably gonna elope
ourselves one day.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.742
Uh, no, I, I can't do that.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.077
safta
would have a conniption.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.370
What are you
trying to say, Evan?

19:23.412 --> 19:24.454
I fully expected Dalia

19:24.496 --> 19:25.914
would trample Evan's heart.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.374
That's the natural order.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.960
It never occurred to me
that Evan would be

19:30.002 --> 19:31.378
the one to hurt Dalia.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.839
Look, cookie, we had fun.
There's no denying it.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.757
Laughs galore. That's what I
bring to the table.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.218
But long-term,
this just wouldn't work.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.761
Why not?

19:39.803 --> 19:41.930
shiksa!

19:41.972 --> 19:43.307
And you're a loser!

19:43.348 --> 19:44.766
Yep, my work here was done.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.226
I'm an amateur magician,
and I've been

19:46.268 --> 19:47.519
practicing for so long.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.066
[panting]

19:53.108 --> 19:55.194
Okay, now, honestly..

19:56.236 --> 19:57.863
...how was it?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.823
You know, it wasn't bad.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.284
It was pretty decent.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.245
Right. Exactly right.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.748
Pretty decent. That's me.
That's what I do.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.462
Seriously, though.
How was it?

20:14.922 --> 20:16.757
You're number one, George!

20:16.798 --> 20:18.675
You are number one!

20:18.717 --> 20:20.719
You know what?
I take it back.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.013
It adds something.
It really does.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.060
There. Now you look
like yourself again.

20:28.101 --> 20:32.231
Yeah. I feel
like myself again, too.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.816
And myself wants you
to get the H out of my R.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.362
As I got the H out of her R

20:38.403 --> 20:40.405
I couldn't help but smile.

20:40.447 --> 20:42.824
It was sort of nice
to have Dalia back to normal.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.831
[instrumental music]

21:20.070 --> 21:24.533
Baruch atah adonai eloheinu.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.702
Melech ha-olam

21:26.743 --> 21:28.328
asher bahar banu..
