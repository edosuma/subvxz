00:05.908 --> 00:07.621
Previously on "Graves"...

00:07.642 --> 00:09.641
Mr. President, I'm gonna have
to ask you to go back to the house.

00:09.642 --> 00:11.641
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Everybody back!

00:11.642 --> 00:12.749
Jesus!

00:12.774 --> 00:15.277
God damn it, I did not
want this to happen.

00:15.278 --> 00:16.641
I've become unshackled.

00:16.642 --> 00:20.641
My new guiding principle
is total spontaneity.

00:20.642 --> 00:22.641
Car. Car!

00:22.642 --> 00:25.249
It's just this family.
They are so dysfunctional.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.641
- To nipples.
- To nipples.

00:27.642 --> 00:29.641
Without 'em, tits wouldn't have a point.

00:29.642 --> 00:32.641
Jeremy is coming home today.

00:32.642 --> 00:34.641
I don't know what I'm doing, Dad.

00:34.642 --> 00:36.641
I'm just happy you're home.

00:36.642 --> 00:38.642
Help Ramona feed those needy people.

00:42.642 --> 00:44.642
This is for you.

00:45.642 --> 00:46.641
I will!

00:46.642 --> 00:48.641
We need you to run against Nash.

00:48.642 --> 00:51.642
Richard, they asked me
to run for the Senate.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:04.641 --> 01:05.641
Homophobia has got to go.

01:05.642 --> 01:09.642
Hey, hey, ho, ho.
Homophobia has got to go.

01:12.642 --> 01:15.642
You have to go. You're going.

01:18.642 --> 01:20.641
It's a wedding, darling.
You love weddings.

01:20.642 --> 01:23.641
They don't want me there, Maggie.

01:23.642 --> 01:25.641
Lawrence has been writing
your speeches for years.

01:25.642 --> 01:27.641
He's family. You are going with me.

01:27.642 --> 01:31.642
It's a homosexual wedding,
for God's sake.

01:32.642 --> 01:36.641
I'm the anti-gay anti-Christ
to those people.

01:36.642 --> 01:40.641
My God, every demographic
that isn't a white male over 50

01:40.642 --> 01:42.405
has protested you at some point.

01:42.406 --> 01:46.191
You're doing this for me
because it's important to your wife

01:46.192 --> 01:49.641
who you love and adore
and support, dear.

01:49.642 --> 01:54.641
If I don't want to walk in front
of a gay liberated firing squad

01:54.642 --> 01:58.641
that's got an ax to grind,
I shouldn't have to.

01:58.642 --> 02:00.641
Oh, Lord.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.641
Oh.

02:35.962 --> 02:38.641
Ma'am, we just got
a call from "Good Day Santa Fe."

02:38.642 --> 02:41.641
- Another appearance request for Jeremy.
- Oh.

02:41.642 --> 02:44.641
It'd be a sit-down with him
for their local Sunday show.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.641
The First Family son back
from the war kind of thing.

02:46.642 --> 02:49.641
It's good to get the Graves family
back out there in a positive way.

02:49.642 --> 02:52.007
Counter what the tabloids
are doing to Olivia

02:52.008 --> 02:53.896
and Richard's recent escapades.

02:53.897 --> 02:55.642
Ah, enough said.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.641
Hey!

02:59.642 --> 03:03.641
God, would some underwear
be too much to ask for?

03:03.642 --> 03:06.641
- We're not primates.
- Yeah, we are, Mom.

03:06.642 --> 03:08.641
Oh, sweetheart, before I go,
I wanted to tell you

03:08.642 --> 03:09.641
that "Good Day Santa Fe" called.

03:09.642 --> 03:12.641
- They want to do an interview with you.
- Pass.

03:12.642 --> 03:16.641
You know what's so funny
is that the media has always loved you.

03:16.642 --> 03:20.641
Even as a boy. Do you remember
sitting on Dan Rather's lap

03:20.642 --> 03:23.641
at Daddy's White House Christmas
chat with the nation?

03:23.642 --> 03:26.641
I was on that man's lap
for way too long.

03:26.642 --> 03:28.641
I don't want you to feel pressured
if it's too much too soon.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.642
- Thank you.
- But I know you're going to be great.

03:32.642 --> 03:35.093
Wait, what?

03:35.118 --> 03:36.864
The president and I are going
to Palm Springs

03:36.889 --> 03:37.868
for Lawrence Mills' wedding.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.212
Yes, ma'am. Ramona's packing
his tux as we speak.

03:40.213 --> 03:41.641
- And Richard?
- Watching her.

03:41.642 --> 03:43.641
Muttering obscenities under his breath.

03:43.642 --> 03:45.899
Something about they're gonna
hang him from a disco ball.

03:45.990 --> 03:48.641
- Not sure.
- All right, you're gonna stay here.

03:48.642 --> 03:50.641
Jeremy's gonna appear
on "Good Day Santa Fe."

03:50.642 --> 03:53.117
I've confirmed all
the questions with the show.

03:53.118 --> 03:54.641
You need to help him prepare.

03:54.642 --> 03:56.641
Rehearse him. He has focus issues.

03:56.642 --> 03:58.641
Make sure he gets there early.

03:58.642 --> 04:00.641
Of course. Whatever I can do to help.

04:09.642 --> 04:11.642
Stop calling me, William.

04:24.642 --> 04:26.641
Liv? Hey, babe, it's me.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.641
I'm in Albuquerque
on my way to LA for business

04:28.642 --> 04:32.641
and, well, I stopped here on purpose
because I need to see you.

04:32.642 --> 04:34.111
So come here to Albuquerque.

04:34.136 --> 04:36.274
I'm staying at the Hyatt, room 542.

04:36.275 --> 04:39.641
Please. I love you, Liv. I really do.

04:51.642 --> 04:53.641
I'm so glad you decided to come.

04:53.642 --> 04:57.641
It's a new me, babe. Facing my victims.

04:57.642 --> 05:00.641
It's going to be like
the Nuremberg trials.

05:00.642 --> 05:02.641
Not true.

05:02.642 --> 05:05.641
Lots of familiar faces.
Friends from Washington.

05:05.642 --> 05:08.641
Well, good networking for you, dear.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.641
Okay, if this foul mood
of yours as of late

05:11.642 --> 05:14.641
is because I've been asked
to run for the Senate,

05:14.642 --> 05:16.641
I'm just still exploring it, honey.

05:16.642 --> 05:20.641
I could do a lot of good.
I could help people.

05:20.642 --> 05:22.641
Maggie,

05:22.642 --> 05:27.642
it could lead right back
to 1600 Pennsylvania.

05:29.442 --> 05:31.641
The things I did in those rooms,

05:31.642 --> 05:35.642
that I allowed, the decisions I made...

05:37.448 --> 05:38.905
I don't know.

05:38.930 --> 05:42.641
Jesus, Maggie, I can't breathe.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.641
Honey, take it easy.

05:44.642 --> 05:47.641
Honey, look at me.

05:47.642 --> 05:49.641
It's just the Senate.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.641
And if I decide to run,

05:51.642 --> 05:54.642
it would mean a lot to know
that you were on board.

06:00.121 --> 06:02.641
You know, I've seen so many

06:02.642 --> 06:05.641
of my dad's body men come and go,

06:05.642 --> 06:07.049
and I hate to break it to you, man,

06:07.074 --> 06:08.641
but there's just no way
you're gonna last.

06:08.642 --> 06:11.291
No, I will. I believe in him.

06:11.292 --> 06:13.641
Come on, still?

06:13.642 --> 06:14.641
Yeah, more so.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.641
President Graves fought
for American idealism.

06:17.642 --> 06:19.641
The power of the individual.

06:19.642 --> 06:22.641
Oh, you're one of those.

06:22.642 --> 06:24.641
Your father believed in people.

06:24.642 --> 06:27.641
That they had the strength
of mind and character

06:27.642 --> 06:30.641
to be able to find
their own life, liberty,

06:30.642 --> 06:32.641
and the pursuit of happiness.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.641
And it worked until it didn't.

06:35.642 --> 06:38.641
Shut up. I'm getting fucking
Bell's palsy just listening to you.

06:38.642 --> 06:41.016
Yeah, I'm sorry. I tend to run
away with myself on the subject.

06:41.041 --> 06:42.093
No shit.

06:42.118 --> 06:44.641
Okay, so going over these for the morning
show...

06:44.642 --> 06:46.641
No, no, fuck that. Let's talk
about the party I'm throwing tonight.

06:46.642 --> 06:49.641
No, no, no, no, no. No party.
Not tonight. No, we have to...

06:49.642 --> 06:51.641
Look, I haven't seen
any of my friends in years, okay?

06:51.642 --> 06:55.641
I just... I need something
to reconnect with.

06:55.642 --> 06:58.641
Besides, the invites have already
gone out. And you're going to help.

06:58.642 --> 07:00.641
What? No, no. I really...
I really shouldn't.

07:00.642 --> 07:01.984
- Isaiah.
- Hi.

07:01.985 --> 07:05.191
- Hey.
- Holy shit! How hot are you?

07:05.192 --> 07:06.909
I'm sorry, that was rude.

07:06.910 --> 07:08.641
- That is so weird.
- Excuse me, Jeremy Graves.

07:08.642 --> 07:10.641
Yeah, I know who you are, Top Gun.

07:10.642 --> 07:12.364
I actually have to clock in
'cause I'm late again,

07:12.365 --> 07:14.641
but we should catch up later, Iz.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.642
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay. Sorry.

07:19.404 --> 07:20.404
Iz?

07:27.201 --> 07:30.641
If you go find me a glass
of champagne, I'll find Lawrence.

07:30.642 --> 07:31.641
- Sure.
- If you're comfortable.

07:31.642 --> 07:33.641
Oh, I'm fine.

07:33.642 --> 07:36.641
All right. Look how beautiful.

07:36.642 --> 07:37.642
Excuse me.

07:39.642 --> 07:42.642
- Mr. President.
- Good to meet you.

07:45.642 --> 07:48.641
Whiskey neat and a champagne.

07:49.882 --> 07:51.589
Mr. President.

07:52.642 --> 07:54.641
Oh, how's it hanging, Barney?

07:54.642 --> 07:57.273
Or is it at constant attention

07:57.274 --> 07:58.641
at these type of things?

07:58.642 --> 08:01.641
Good to see you're still the piece
of shit I know and hate.

08:01.642 --> 08:03.641
President Graves. Congressman.

08:34.642 --> 08:37.642
You came.

08:38.642 --> 08:41.640
I am so happy for both of you.

08:41.642 --> 08:45.641
We couldn't be happier that you're
here, Maggie. So where's the boss man?

08:45.642 --> 08:48.405
Probably somewhere trying to make
sure he doesn't get any gay on him.

08:48.406 --> 08:51.641
- Alan!
- He's fetching me a drink.

08:51.642 --> 08:53.641
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to mingle.

08:53.642 --> 08:56.641
All right, babe. So, tell me.

08:56.642 --> 08:58.641
Is the rumor true? You gonna make a run?

08:58.642 --> 09:00.641
Oh, my God, I need them to be true.

09:00.642 --> 09:02.641
That Nash motherfucker
is climbing in the polls.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.641
We're still just considering it.

09:04.642 --> 09:08.641
But if I do decide to go forward,
I would need you on my team, Lawrence.

09:08.642 --> 09:10.641
Press secretary, speechwriter.

09:10.642 --> 09:12.296
Help me land on a message.

09:12.297 --> 09:14.641
I can't even imagine
doing this without you.

09:15.167 --> 09:18.143
Well, I'm flattered, Margaret,

09:18.642 --> 09:19.641
but...

09:19.642 --> 09:23.641
- Mags, here you are.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

09:23.642 --> 09:26.641
Some hell of a night
you're putting on here, pal.

09:26.642 --> 09:28.641
Well, I never thought it could happen.

09:28.642 --> 09:31.641
No, it's so much more
than just a wedding.

09:31.642 --> 09:34.641
You know, it still feels like we're
taking some kind of stand.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.641
Fighting the system.

09:38.642 --> 09:41.161
Anyway, it means a lot
that you're here, sir.

09:41.162 --> 09:43.642
And I'll see you inside in a bit, okay?

09:46.642 --> 09:48.641
Are you okay, honey?

09:48.642 --> 09:50.641
Oh, yeah. I'm... yeah.

09:50.642 --> 09:52.641
I just...

09:52.642 --> 09:54.641
I'm fine.

09:54.642 --> 09:57.246
I... I... I'm going this way.

09:57.247 --> 09:58.641
Itching.

10:07.642 --> 10:09.642
This is so strange, you know?

10:11.530 --> 10:13.530
But I like seeing you here in my bed.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.641
I like it here, too.

10:20.642 --> 10:25.641
There's a definite... smell.

10:25.642 --> 10:27.641
I don't know.

10:27.642 --> 10:30.641
It's unlike anything I've ever
experienced before.

10:30.642 --> 10:34.641
It smells... I don't know.

10:34.642 --> 10:36.641
- Poor?
- Yes!

10:36.642 --> 10:39.641
Babe, you don't get it.

10:39.642 --> 10:42.641
I like the smell of poverty.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.641
It's different. It's the opposite.

10:47.332 --> 10:49.641
It's the 99%.

10:50.155 --> 10:53.124
I'm just so used to being
controlled, you know?

10:53.125 --> 10:56.641
Worried about how I'm being perceived.

10:56.642 --> 10:58.641
Scared shitless
that I'm not gonna live up

10:58.642 --> 11:01.338
to some fairy tale of my family.

11:01.339 --> 11:03.641
A fairy tale I didn't
even fucking write.

11:03.642 --> 11:06.641
This... this...

11:06.642 --> 11:08.642
I'm writing this.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.642
A girl's got to pee.

11:37.642 --> 11:40.641
If you do run, Maggie,
and I hope that you do,

11:40.642 --> 11:42.121
I can't come along for the ride.

11:42.122 --> 11:44.641
I'm so sorry,

11:44.642 --> 11:49.641
but everything has been
about career for so long.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.641
And Alan wants me in DC.

11:51.642 --> 11:53.641
He's in line for head
of oncology at Inova.

11:53.642 --> 11:56.641
And I have an offer
that I'm going to accept

11:56.642 --> 11:57.973
that's gonna keep me in town.

11:57.974 --> 12:00.641
We're talking about adopting.

12:00.642 --> 12:04.641
I mean, can you imagine me a dad?

12:04.642 --> 12:06.079
The best.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.641
Tell me you understand.

12:07.642 --> 12:12.641
I just feel a little alone
with this decision

12:12.642 --> 12:15.641
and I wanted to know
I would have a familiar face

12:15.642 --> 12:18.641
if I do go through with it, you know?

12:19.212 --> 12:22.358
Anyway, I'm so happy for you.

12:31.642 --> 12:34.483
- This is actually very nice.
- Nice?

12:34.508 --> 12:36.641
Yeah, everyone seems to be
enjoying themselves.

12:36.642 --> 12:38.641
It's a very convivial atmosphere.

12:38.642 --> 12:39.641
Let me tell you something, okay?

12:39.642 --> 12:42.304
Every single one of these
people showed up on time.

12:42.305 --> 12:43.641
None of them have even touched the keg

12:43.642 --> 12:45.641
that you nearly died getting
into the back of my truck.

12:45.642 --> 12:47.641
I don't get it.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.326
That brunette over there who used
to be a fucking baller, by the way,

12:50.327 --> 12:52.641
she brought a bottle of Prosecco
and called it "champs"

12:52.642 --> 12:54.418
and then asked if I could hook her up

12:54.419 --> 12:56.641
with a Chelsea Clinton interview
for her fucking blog.

12:56.642 --> 12:57.641
Chel... can you?

12:57.642 --> 12:59.641
That girl over there
used to give a hand job

12:59.642 --> 13:02.641
that was indisputable proof
that Jesus was a white man.

13:02.642 --> 13:04.641
She brought hummus and pita chips

13:04.642 --> 13:08.641
and can only do a stop-by because they're
expecting their fourth any day now.

13:08.642 --> 13:10.255
Who the fuck are these people?

13:10.256 --> 13:12.641
There's at least three guys
here I'd consider catfishing.

13:13.461 --> 13:15.641
Oh, thank God she came.

13:15.642 --> 13:17.641
Sam? What is Sammy doing here?

13:17.642 --> 13:20.206
- I invited her.
- What? When? Why?

13:21.517 --> 13:23.641
You know he's gonna bang
your girlfriend, right?

13:23.642 --> 13:25.641
What? No, she's not my girlfriend.

13:25.642 --> 13:28.641
- What are you talking about?
- This is Summer.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.642
Summer?

13:31.642 --> 13:32.641
Where the hell have you been?

13:32.642 --> 13:35.642
Bathroom. I don't want to talk about it.

13:37.642 --> 13:40.641
Oh, what's the matter?
Are you all right?

13:40.642 --> 13:44.641
I just... I asked Lawrence if I did run

13:44.642 --> 13:46.641
if he would help me
and he said he can't.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.641
Which is okay.

13:48.642 --> 13:51.865
Lawrence and I met
through mutual friends

13:51.866 --> 13:54.641
and I have wanted to marry this man

13:54.642 --> 13:57.641
from the moment I laid eyes on him.

13:57.642 --> 13:59.641
It's taken some time to get here.

13:59.642 --> 14:03.641
We've overcome so much. So
many obstacles have been put in our way.

14:03.642 --> 14:07.641
Men and laws trying
to prevent this union.

14:07.642 --> 14:10.641
Mountains we've had to climb over.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.232
Okay, easy, fella.

14:12.233 --> 14:16.641
Anyway, I am not the speechwriting
half of this power couple,

14:16.642 --> 14:20.641
so I thought I'd do it a different way.

14:21.012 --> 14:24.642
Maestro.

14:25.642 --> 14:28.641
Thank you. Yeah.

14:28.642 --> 14:30.641
Congratulations, fellas.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.456
Okay.

14:46.318 --> 14:49.317
You're beautiful.

15:22.318 --> 15:25.317
Fuck me.

15:25.318 --> 15:27.317
If I'm being honest with myself...

15:27.318 --> 15:29.317
that's one of my forever goals...

15:29.318 --> 15:32.317
it was never gonna work out with William.
You know what I mean?

15:32.318 --> 15:34.317
I mean, sometimes I feel like

15:34.318 --> 15:37.317
I'm wearing a suicide vest of emotions.

15:37.318 --> 15:39.317
You know what I mean?
Not like... not like I'm suicidal.

15:39.318 --> 15:43.317
I mean, okay, once in high school.

15:43.318 --> 15:46.317
That was like a pact. Everyone bailed.

15:46.318 --> 15:49.317
I just mean, like, an emotional
vest itself, you know?

15:49.318 --> 15:52.317
It's just like on me all the time.

15:52.318 --> 15:55.317
And then, boom, insecurity is over here,

15:55.318 --> 15:59.098
resentment over here, mommy issues
just like all over the fucking place.

15:59.099 --> 16:00.317
You know? Fuck.

16:00.318 --> 16:03.318
My therapist says I process
out loud too much.

16:05.318 --> 16:08.318
William used to say
I could never shut up.

16:09.318 --> 16:12.317
- Am I being so annoying?
- No.

16:12.793 --> 16:14.317
You're complicated.

16:16.318 --> 16:19.523
And you, Olivia, are
perfectamente complicada.

16:20.070 --> 16:22.318
Perfectly complicated.

16:24.318 --> 16:26.317
Mr. President.

16:26.318 --> 16:29.317
President Graves, I would love it

16:29.318 --> 16:31.804
if you would join us boys for a drink.

16:33.130 --> 16:34.596
He would be honored.

16:39.318 --> 16:42.318
- Just go to the bar.
- All right.

16:47.318 --> 16:50.317
Hey, Summer.

16:50.318 --> 16:53.317
Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but I have
Jonathan Dalton on the line.

16:53.318 --> 16:55.625
The Jonathan Dalton.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.792
Could you ask him if he could call back

17:00.817 --> 17:03.317
on my cell phone in about 30 minutes?

17:03.318 --> 17:04.318
Yes, ma'am.

17:13.550 --> 17:16.318
I think GI Jane's
enjoying his bar mitzvah.

17:17.776 --> 17:20.317
My job depends on getting
him to do something

17:20.318 --> 17:22.317
he has flat out refused to do

17:22.318 --> 17:25.050
and I have no idea
how to change his mind.

17:25.051 --> 17:27.317
You know, in his biography
President Graves says

17:27.318 --> 17:29.317
you have to be able to reach your peers,

17:29.318 --> 17:33.318
people your age, since they're
your future constituency.

17:34.318 --> 17:36.317
Well, soldier boy seems about your age

17:36.318 --> 17:39.607
and I'd say he's peer adjacent,
so find a way to reach him.

17:39.608 --> 17:42.043
You make that sound so easy.

17:42.068 --> 17:43.530
Well, shouldn't it be?

17:44.318 --> 17:45.793
You mind?

17:46.786 --> 17:48.417
The more the merrier.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.963
Everyone's leaving. Thank God.

17:51.964 --> 17:55.722
Rounds in the morning.
I have to relieve the sitter.

17:55.723 --> 17:57.651
I'm gonna turn into a pumpkin.

17:58.318 --> 18:00.317
Blah, blah, blah. Bye, guys.

18:00.318 --> 18:02.317
Hey, drive safe, okay?

18:02.659 --> 18:06.317
You're staying, right?
Please tell me you're staying.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.820
I could use some company.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.848
And by company I mean pity sex.

18:09.849 --> 18:12.678
Oh, my God. Okay.

18:12.679 --> 18:16.317
So I know that you just got
back from serving our country,

18:16.318 --> 18:18.317
- so respect.
- Thank you.

18:18.318 --> 18:20.317
And maybe you're just
not hearing yourself,

18:20.318 --> 18:22.317
but you kind of sound like a douchebag.

18:22.318 --> 18:25.317
That guy's got rounds?
That means that someone is sick

18:25.318 --> 18:26.878
and he's going to make them feel better.

18:26.879 --> 18:28.317
That chick's got to relieve the sitter?

18:28.318 --> 18:30.317
That means there's kids at home
missing their mom and dad

18:30.318 --> 18:32.317
and they put all that
on hold to come here

18:32.318 --> 18:36.722
and say, "Welcome home.
Real glad you didn't die out there."

18:36.723 --> 18:39.317
Now I get it. The struggle is real.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.684
But people grow up. It's what happens.

18:41.685 --> 18:44.317
Also, he's super smart
and just trying to do his job,

18:44.318 --> 18:47.317
so stop being a pain in the ass
and just listen to him.

18:47.318 --> 18:49.317
By the way,

18:49.318 --> 18:52.864
I'm going to a really rad concert
Friday night if you want to hang.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.317
Yeah, sure. I'd love to hang.

18:56.318 --> 18:58.318
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:59.318 --> 19:01.317
- Peace, y'all.
- Peace.

19:01.318 --> 19:04.317
Oh, and tell the president
next time we're drinking,

19:04.318 --> 19:06.318
I pick the bar.

19:08.318 --> 19:09.803
Dad knows her?

19:11.318 --> 19:13.317
Dad knows her?

19:21.318 --> 19:23.317
Hey, ho, hey, ho.

19:23.318 --> 19:25.317
Homophobia has got to go.

19:26.739 --> 19:28.978
Tell me the truth, Graves.

19:28.979 --> 19:31.720
Why do you give two shits
if two men get married?

19:31.721 --> 19:33.570
Easy, honey. Come on.

19:33.571 --> 19:37.119
At my age, any shit's a victory.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.713
You don't have any idea
what your policies did, do you?

19:40.714 --> 19:42.317
Okay, you know what?
I think we've reached...

19:42.318 --> 19:44.576
Relax. I'm fine.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.317
We're just two grown men
having a conversation.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.560
Isn't that right, Mr. President?

19:49.273 --> 19:51.272
- Lunatic.
- Alan, Jesus.

19:51.318 --> 19:54.317
You want to know what chaps my ass?

19:54.318 --> 19:56.317
Is giving a history lesson

19:56.318 --> 19:59.317
to a bunch of self-righteous gay men

19:59.811 --> 20:02.843
who don't know how good they've had it.

20:03.318 --> 20:06.317
I may be a dinosaur on this subject,

20:06.318 --> 20:08.317
but I believe what I believe.

20:08.318 --> 20:11.317
And it's in my DNA, good or bad.

20:11.531 --> 20:14.722
It just doesn't sit well with me.

20:15.689 --> 20:18.317
And no one knows my position

20:18.318 --> 20:20.317
better than you, Lawrence.

20:20.318 --> 20:25.317
You wrote half my speeches and sold it.

20:25.318 --> 20:27.317
That was work.

20:28.178 --> 20:30.317
This is my life.

20:30.318 --> 20:31.491
Oh, horseshit.

20:33.318 --> 20:37.317
I have sex with men, Mr. President.

20:37.318 --> 20:38.317
Yeah.

20:38.318 --> 20:43.317
Penetrative, anal sex.

20:43.318 --> 20:45.317
Oh, Jesus, Lawrence.

20:45.318 --> 20:47.317
You can't even hear the words, can you?

20:47.318 --> 20:50.317
I hear it and then I see it in my head

20:50.318 --> 20:53.013
and it just fucks me up.

20:53.075 --> 20:56.317
Well, guess what? The closet
door has swung wide open

20:56.318 --> 21:00.317
and put a ding in the driver's side
of your shiny legacy

21:00.318 --> 21:02.317
that I helped write.

21:02.657 --> 21:06.638
God knows, sir, it's given me
hundreds of sleepless nights.

21:07.951 --> 21:11.317
Who cares what I think anymore, huh?

21:11.318 --> 21:15.317
You fellas had a free pass
to two institutions

21:15.318 --> 21:18.317
that make most men wet the bed...

21:18.318 --> 21:21.441
marriage and the military.

21:22.408 --> 21:25.864
And you morons fought to get them both.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.317
So marry each other.

21:28.318 --> 21:33.048
I don't give a rat's ass.
Welcome to the shit, boys.

21:33.073 --> 21:35.073
Hallelujah.

21:40.318 --> 21:43.317
Mr. President. Mr. President.

21:48.318 --> 21:50.317
- Jonathan.
- Margaret.

21:50.318 --> 21:52.317
How are you?

21:52.318 --> 21:55.317
I'm well. I'm good.

21:55.318 --> 21:57.317
And Richard? All good, I hope.

21:57.318 --> 21:59.317
Richard's Richard.

21:59.318 --> 22:03.317
So, look, I wanted to ask
if you would give the keynote

22:03.318 --> 22:05.317
at my annual Red Cross
fundraiser next week.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.317
And I heard through the grapevine

22:08.318 --> 22:10.317
that you've been approached to run.

22:10.318 --> 22:12.317
Reclaim the compassion in conservatism.

22:12.318 --> 22:15.317
Well, nothing's been decided yet.
It's just talk.

22:15.318 --> 22:19.937
If you're serious about making
a go at senator, I want in.

22:19.938 --> 22:21.486
That shouldn't be a surprise to you.

22:21.487 --> 22:23.317
Well, we'll see. It's a lot.

22:23.318 --> 22:27.317
Oh, come on now.
Don't go soft on me, Mags.

22:27.318 --> 22:29.317
That's not the girl I know.

22:31.318 --> 22:33.317
You are so beautiful.

22:34.026 --> 22:36.318
Good night, Jonathan.

22:37.318 --> 22:39.317
You had a panic attack.

22:39.318 --> 22:40.317
It felt like a heart attack.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.317
Well, it wasn't, but we can run you over

22:42.318 --> 22:44.317
to Desert Regional
for an EKG if you want.

22:44.318 --> 22:46.317
No, no, no, no, no.

22:46.318 --> 22:48.317
It was very stressful
for you being here.

22:48.318 --> 22:50.317
It gave me the hives.

22:50.318 --> 22:52.502
Symptomatic of stress.

22:56.318 --> 22:58.006
We were a little harsh on you.

22:58.597 --> 23:00.317
Pent up, you know?

23:00.798 --> 23:03.317
8,000 years of repression
give or take a century.

23:03.318 --> 23:06.317
Lawrence, the things you wrote for me

23:06.318 --> 23:09.317
and for other politicians like me,

23:10.133 --> 23:13.317
the compromises you made,

23:13.318 --> 23:17.317
I can imagine how that feels.

23:17.318 --> 23:21.317
I understand what you
have to give of yourself

23:21.318 --> 23:25.317
in order to win, get ahead.

23:25.318 --> 23:28.318
I know that now.

23:30.318 --> 23:31.616
The regret.

23:34.318 --> 23:36.317
Maggie isn't like me.

23:36.958 --> 23:40.318
Not in this issue or any other.

23:41.318 --> 23:45.318
And in all those years
at the White House, she never was.

23:47.318 --> 23:50.317
So if she decides to run,

23:50.318 --> 23:54.318
she needs the best
to stand right beside her.

23:56.318 --> 24:00.874
And I don't know anyone better than you.

24:08.987 --> 24:10.317
You don't have to do that, man.

24:10.318 --> 24:11.317
It's not part of the job description.

24:11.318 --> 24:13.318
Oh, no, I don't mind.

24:15.318 --> 24:17.318
Why do you do that?

24:26.318 --> 24:29.318
I used to dream of escaping this place.

24:30.441 --> 24:34.317
But whatever happened,

24:34.318 --> 24:37.317
whatever I did, wherever I go,

24:37.318 --> 24:39.317
I just...

24:39.897 --> 24:42.640
I always end up...

24:42.641 --> 24:44.727
right back here.

24:44.728 --> 24:48.317
Just a different perspective here,

24:48.920 --> 24:51.944
you end up exactly where
you're supposed to be.

24:53.318 --> 24:56.317
You are talking to someone
who followed your rise

24:56.318 --> 24:57.317
through the Scouts religiously.

24:57.318 --> 25:01.317
No, my elementary school
was littered with those posters.

25:01.318 --> 25:04.317
One thing I know
is that people like you.

25:04.318 --> 25:08.676
You know, I'd watch the Graves White
House Christmas specials every year.

25:08.677 --> 25:09.907
Oh, my God.

25:09.932 --> 25:12.317
No, and Dan Rather's
little interview with you

25:12.318 --> 25:15.317
at the end was the best
part of the whole thing.

25:15.318 --> 25:19.786
And not just because you were
this cute, little, smiling kid,

25:20.528 --> 25:23.317
but because you always
said something funny

25:23.555 --> 25:26.850
and weirdly insightful.

25:30.318 --> 25:34.317
You know, you have this
interview tomorrow...

25:34.318 --> 25:38.317
...and from what I've seen

25:38.318 --> 25:41.317
since you're been home, really,
and maybe I'm way off base,

25:41.318 --> 25:44.317
but I get the feeling

25:44.318 --> 25:46.318
that you got plenty to say.

25:47.992 --> 25:49.318
So?

25:53.318 --> 25:55.317
By the way, I was never a Scout.

25:55.318 --> 25:58.317
They paid me like half a mil

25:58.318 --> 26:01.317
to wear that stupid uniform
and pose for the poster.

26:01.318 --> 26:04.317
The photographer got me high
and introduced me to porn.

26:06.318 --> 26:08.318
Make it stop.

26:10.318 --> 26:13.702
Graves, you let the bad guys get
guns with that NRA bullshit.

26:13.703 --> 26:15.749
You were just a reckless cowboy.

26:15.750 --> 26:18.317
You loved me, Barney. You know it.

26:18.318 --> 26:22.317
Oh, my goodness. One gay wedding
and you're hitting on Barney Frank.

26:22.318 --> 26:25.317
- We live to dance another day.
- All right.

26:25.318 --> 26:28.317
Hey, some people
trying to sleep up here!

26:28.318 --> 26:32.317
Men nonsexually hot tubbing down here.

26:32.318 --> 26:36.317
Shut your goddamn mouth.

26:43.588 --> 26:45.317
I'll be back in an hour

26:45.318 --> 26:50.318
to cook you the petit
dejeuner of your dreams.

26:52.318 --> 26:54.318
That means breakfast.

26:55.318 --> 26:57.317
So glad we found each other, Olivia.

26:58.703 --> 27:00.317
Mi pajarito.

27:07.318 --> 27:10.318
Bitch is nuts, ese.

27:17.318 --> 27:20.317
Okay, just don't get rattled
no matter what they ask.

27:20.318 --> 27:23.317
We've gone through all the preapproved
questions, right?

27:23.318 --> 27:26.317
But if you feel unsafe, just try
to steer them in a different direction.

27:26.318 --> 27:28.798
And don't forget to breathe.

27:28.823 --> 27:30.444
I got this. Here.

27:30.445 --> 27:33.318
Yeah, no. I got this.

27:39.318 --> 27:41.317
- Lawrence just called.
- And?

27:41.318 --> 27:43.317
And he said he had
a sudden change of heart

27:43.318 --> 27:46.317
and that if I did decide
to run, he's on board.

27:46.318 --> 27:49.318
Well, he's a good man.

27:55.318 --> 27:59.317
It has been such fun, Jeremy,
having you here in the studio.

27:59.318 --> 28:02.317
And I bet you missed
the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta

28:02.318 --> 28:03.765
being in Afghanistan, am I right?

28:03.766 --> 28:06.317
One of the many reasons
I'm glad to be home.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.016
Before we let you go, let's talk
about your father.

28:09.041 --> 28:10.317
Yeah, what about him?

28:10.318 --> 28:13.510
He's been a little erratic
lately, don't you think?

28:13.511 --> 28:14.496
Excuse me?

28:14.521 --> 28:17.056
People just want to know
what's going on, Jeremy.

28:17.057 --> 28:19.317
- What's the truth?
- Okay.

28:20.068 --> 28:23.317
Well, let's forget for a second
that you're talking about my father.

28:23.318 --> 28:25.781
What's actually going on here

28:25.879 --> 28:30.317
is that you two fake mannequin people

28:30.318 --> 28:32.317
aren't smart enough to ask
an honest question

28:32.318 --> 28:35.317
without gas-lighting your audience

28:35.318 --> 28:38.317
with a bunch of
sensationalistic bullshit.

28:38.318 --> 28:41.317
An audience that has literally stopped

28:41.318 --> 28:44.317
being able to discern
truth from fiction.

28:44.318 --> 28:46.317
So truth?

28:46.318 --> 28:48.317
You could ask me about cancer research.

28:48.318 --> 28:51.317
You could ask me about immigration.
But you didn't, did you?

28:51.318 --> 28:53.317
Because then we'd be
talking about the issue.

28:53.318 --> 28:57.317
But, hey, just keep whacking
that old Graves pinata

28:57.318 --> 28:59.586
that you guys have
been hanging for the last 30 years, okay?

28:59.587 --> 29:02.317
Just know if you ever do it again

29:02.318 --> 29:04.317
in front of me,

29:04.318 --> 29:06.317
I'm gonna come over there

29:06.318 --> 29:09.318
and beat the fucking truth into you.

29:10.305 --> 29:16.442
