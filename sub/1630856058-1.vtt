01:57.427 --> 01:59.809

02:01.293 --> 02:02.501
Hey, great job

02:02.605 --> 02:03.468
Oh, thank you!

02:03.571 --> 02:05.159
- What did you think?
- Oh, God.

02:05.263 --> 02:07.506
Is that Mr. Waters'
little brother Buck

- No. Not yet.

02:15.376 --> 02:16.998
Oh, you got to
check it out.

02:17.102 --> 02:19.863
It's playing regionally thanks
to David's marketing genius.

02:19.967 --> 02:21.348
Yeah, I directed
that bad boy.

02:21.451 --> 02:23.039
- Oh, I remember, Buck.
- Ha, I know.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.730
I kicked you
off the set.

02:24.834 --> 02:25.973
Yeah, okay, okay.

02:26.076 --> 02:27.008
That's what I remember.

02:27.112 --> 02:28.148
Hey, Buck.

02:28.251 --> 02:29.701
You remember me?

02:29.804 --> 02:31.012
Jimmy Carruthers.

02:31.116 --> 02:34.533
You were my peewee
football coach.

02:34.637 --> 02:37.640
Yo, yo, yo, TikTok. Um...

02:37.743 --> 02:39.124
if you ever wanted
to see my dick,

02:39.228 --> 02:40.401
Merry Christmas to you.

02:40.505 --> 02:41.920
It's hard to fit it
under the tree.

02:42.023 --> 02:43.266
Please shoot me.

02:43.370 --> 02:45.234
David, we still got to get
Roger Evans.

02:45.337 --> 02:46.787
He won't sign those papers.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.409
Roger's house is the last thing
standing in the way.

02:48.513 --> 02:50.411
Standing in
the way of what?

02:50.515 --> 02:51.964
Well, this is exciting.

02:52.068 --> 02:53.690
Phase Four for
the new Angel Falls.

02:53.794 --> 02:56.279
It's gonna be your future
favorite shopping,

02:56.383 --> 02:58.937
dining, and lifestyle destination.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.148
LA's got The Grove.
We're gonna have Waters Cove.

03:03.252 --> 03:05.012
Can't believe you didn't
tell her about this!

03:05.115 --> 03:07.152
Didn't the town council
decide his house

03:07.256 --> 03:08.429
is an historic landmark?

03:08.533 --> 03:10.328
Ma'am, they almost did.

03:10.431 --> 03:12.399
See, I'm a little bit
more persuasive

03:12.502 --> 03:14.055
than my father ever was.

03:14.159 --> 03:18.232
He was so driven by sentiment.

03:18.336 --> 03:20.303
Let's go, Dave.
We'll talk about it on the way.

03:20.407 --> 03:23.099
Dad, it's Christmas Eve.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.584
Just keep my meal warm.
I won't be long.

03:25.688 --> 03:26.965
You have a microwave?

03:27.068 --> 03:28.518
You can heat up
the food afterwards.

03:28.622 --> 03:30.520
- It'll be fine.
- I love the microwave.

03:30.624 --> 03:33.040
Yeah, she cooks all the meals
in the microwave.

03:33.143 --> 03:34.973
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

03:35.076 --> 03:37.562
Come on.

03:37.665 --> 03:41.048
It's okay, Mom.
This happens every Christmas.

03:41.151 --> 03:42.429
You ought to be used
to it by now.

03:42.532 --> 03:44.085
Come on.
Let's go home.

03:44.189 --> 03:47.675
Henry Waters, Prince of
Angel Falls, strikes again.

03:47.779 --> 03:50.609
♪ Around the fire
on Christmas night ♪

03:50.713 --> 03:52.473
Here we go, Roger.
You got the pen?

03:52.577 --> 03:55.200
All ready to go.
Let me just twist it.

03:55.304 --> 03:57.409
Ready to go for you.

03:57.513 --> 03:58.755
Mr. Evans,
we know you're carrying

03:58.859 --> 04:01.344
a lot of debt,
and you could use the money.

04:01.448 --> 04:04.623
So, I think it's a really great
idea to sign.

04:04.727 --> 04:06.660
You're a good man, David.

04:06.763 --> 04:09.387
But my family's lived here
for generations.

04:09.490 --> 04:12.113
My granddaughter
will own it next.

04:12.217 --> 04:13.253
I'm not signing.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.568
When your dad died
a few years ago, Henry,

04:18.672 --> 04:22.331
he should have left
the business to David.

04:22.434 --> 04:23.746
But I'm his son.

04:23.849 --> 04:26.783
David was more of a son to him
than you ever were.

04:26.887 --> 04:29.579
Look, Roger.
I know you and your family,

04:29.683 --> 04:32.548
you used to be
the gold standard around here.

04:32.651 --> 04:34.135
Especially
at Christmas time.

04:34.239 --> 04:37.518
You donated those trees,
year after year.

04:37.622 --> 04:39.279
But that was in the past.

04:39.382 --> 04:40.728
'Cause I'm here now.

04:40.832 --> 04:43.352
So, I want you to take
a look around your town--

04:43.455 --> 04:46.009
if you're able to walk
outside on your own.

04:46.113 --> 04:48.805
And you will see that
I'm the person this town

04:48.909 --> 04:51.981
needs to move us
on into the future.

04:52.084 --> 04:55.916
By kicking them from their
storefronts and their homes?

04:56.019 --> 05:00.369
The people of this town
<i>are</i> its future, Henry.

05:00.472 --> 05:02.094
They want to live.

05:02.198 --> 05:04.787
To work and be happy.
And that's it.

05:04.890 --> 05:05.926
Your father knew that.

05:06.029 --> 05:08.549
Why do you want to take
that away from them?

05:08.653 --> 05:12.312
Why do you want to turn them
into your drones?

05:16.868 --> 05:19.698
Roger, you don't know
anything about my father.

05:19.802 --> 05:22.839
So why don't we leave him
out of this, yeah?

05:27.637 --> 05:29.467
It's your last chance.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.848
Sign the papers.

05:37.302 --> 05:39.131
No.

05:39.235 --> 05:41.686
You okay, Grandpa?

05:41.789 --> 05:42.825
Hi, Cara.

05:42.928 --> 05:45.414
Just a little
Christmas business.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.348
You off to the party?

05:48.451 --> 05:50.177
Yeah.
Unless you need me to stay?

05:50.280 --> 05:52.800
No, no, you go on.
Have fun.

05:52.904 --> 05:55.493
Love you, Grandpa.

05:55.596 --> 05:56.873
Good to see you,
Mr. Carruthers.

05:56.977 --> 05:58.254
Great to see you, Cara.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.566
We'll see you tomorrow night
for dinner?

05:59.669 --> 06:01.153
Great.
Have fun at the party.

06:01.257 --> 06:03.397
Hey, Cara.

06:03.501 --> 06:05.434
You be safe now.

06:13.683 --> 06:15.340
For my gay son!

06:15.444 --> 06:19.309
Oh, a rainbow!
Ornament.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.070
Isn't it cute?

06:21.173 --> 06:22.968
Just like you.

06:28.836 --> 06:32.495
You're gonna have to hang that
on every Christmas tree

06:32.599 --> 06:34.877
for the rest
of her life.

06:36.085 --> 06:37.673
Alright, alright.
Everyone cool your tits.

06:37.776 --> 06:40.054
- We're here.
- Where have you been, sis?

06:40.158 --> 06:41.504
Oh, Karen's parents.

06:41.608 --> 06:43.920
We were just having another
lovely Christmas Eve dinner.

06:44.024 --> 06:48.166
We explained we are, in fact,
married and not roommates.

06:48.269 --> 06:49.719
What can I say?

06:49.823 --> 06:52.895
My parents aren't exactly
marching at Pride any time soon.

06:52.998 --> 06:55.829
Winnie,
Cara's waiting outside.

06:55.932 --> 06:56.761
Oh. Coming, Jimmy?

06:56.864 --> 06:58.521
I have to do my hair. Hm.

06:58.625 --> 06:59.971
Does this help?

07:00.074 --> 07:01.006
No.

07:03.008 --> 07:04.803
- Bye, Mom!
- Oh, okay.

07:04.907 --> 07:06.080
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

11:34.521 --> 11:36.696
let's get
out of here, yeah?

11:44.186 --> 11:46.498
The lights
are so pretty.

11:46.602 --> 11:48.846
They should keep them up
all year.

11:51.987 --> 11:53.160
Here?

11:53.264 --> 11:56.301
This is perfect.

11:56.405 --> 11:58.441
Kiss me.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.103
Ew.
What did you eat?

12:50.079 --> 12:51.253
Help me!

12:51.356 --> 12:53.427
Somebody please help me!

12:53.531 --> 12:55.429
He's after me!

13:03.713 --> 13:05.508
Winnie, come back!

13:06.993 --> 13:08.649
Come on.
We got to go.

13:08.753 --> 13:10.444
Okay.

13:11.273 --> 13:14.138
No! Cara, no! No!
No! No!

13:14.241 --> 13:17.589
No, no, no.
No, you're...

13:17.693 --> 13:18.728
you're not dead. Please.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.489
Please, wake up.

13:23.388 --> 13:24.424
Please.

14:39.464 --> 14:40.880
Come on.

14:40.983 --> 14:43.192
Get up.
Get up, come on!

14:45.988 --> 14:50.303
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

15:57.577 --> 16:00.235
Mr. Waters?

16:11.798 --> 16:13.593
Angel Falls is renewed.

16:13.696 --> 16:14.870
And full of life!

16:14.974 --> 16:17.286
Our community is stronger
than ever.

16:17.390 --> 16:19.944
Hey, Chad!
Have a great day

16:20.048 --> 16:21.428
Everyone has a smile.

16:21.532 --> 16:23.983
And we give free smiles
with every home purchase

16:24.086 --> 16:26.916
from Carruthers
Family Realty.

16:27.020 --> 16:30.575
Because, with us,
you don't just get a house.

16:31.956 --> 16:34.269
<i>You get a home!</i>

16:37.065 --> 16:40.068
Can't believe that
was the best take.

17:33.776 --> 17:36.055
Not another Christmas.

17:37.366 --> 17:39.334
Let's go, Winnie.

17:46.306 --> 17:49.551
We're gonna be late!
Jimmy!

17:49.654 --> 17:51.967
Oh.
Did you hear from NYU?

17:52.071 --> 17:54.590
Not yet.

17:54.694 --> 17:57.386
You forgot your camera.

17:57.490 --> 17:59.078
No, I didn't.

17:59.181 --> 18:01.010
Hey, you guys.
Do you smell that?

18:01.114 --> 18:02.978
It's Christmas.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.774
♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪

18:05.877 --> 18:08.397
♪ Fa la la la la,
la la la la ♪

18:08.501 --> 18:09.467
Everyone!

18:09.571 --> 18:11.987
♪ 'Tis the season
to be jolly ♪

18:45.262 --> 18:47.229
You killed my brother.

18:51.820 --> 18:53.753
Your family,
they're, um...

18:53.856 --> 18:56.825
they're really thriving
'cause of what you did.

18:59.068 --> 19:02.382
The whole town's happy
he's dead.

19:02.486 --> 19:06.041
That night still
haunts me, Buck.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.837
Every day I'm sorry.

19:10.356 --> 19:11.598
I should fucking end you.

19:11.702 --> 19:14.705
I should fucking end you
'cause of what you did.

19:25.094 --> 19:27.925
Look outside.
It's snowing.

19:28.028 --> 19:29.133
Oh, my gosh.

19:29.237 --> 19:31.100
Looks like everybody
got their wish.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.310
<i>They sure did.</i>

19:33.413 --> 19:36.071
Okay, and one for Winnie.

19:36.175 --> 19:40.627
I love this tradition of opening
one gift on Christmas Eve.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.428
Come on, open it.
I want to see!

19:53.226 --> 19:54.469
Workout gear?

19:54.572 --> 19:57.196
Pink!
But you love pink.

19:57.299 --> 19:58.818
Good job, David!

19:58.921 --> 20:00.716
Nobody had that color.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.167
David, no, no, no.

20:03.271 --> 20:05.169
The dick
got me a scale.

20:05.273 --> 20:06.895
We can hear
you guys whispering.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.345
What's the matter?

20:08.448 --> 20:10.347
You never give women gifts
related to their bodies.

20:10.450 --> 20:13.039
It's never okay.
Even if it's from your own dad.

20:13.142 --> 20:14.558
Especially if it's
from your own dad.

20:14.661 --> 20:17.664
Oh, come on. It's fun.
It's got your initial on it.

20:17.768 --> 20:19.528
Come on.
Just go put it on.

20:19.632 --> 20:23.118
Judy, maybe she just
tries it on later.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.121
Winnie.
Come on, just go put it on.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.674
For us.

20:27.778 --> 20:30.090
Please.

20:30.194 --> 20:31.160
Okay.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.266
Alright!

20:35.268 --> 20:37.236
Charades?

20:40.411 --> 20:43.242
Jesus Christmas!

20:47.176 --> 20:50.456
Here you go, Mom and Dad.

20:50.559 --> 20:52.389
Where did everyone go?

20:52.492 --> 20:56.703
Oh, well, your brother
got a new truck.

20:56.807 --> 20:58.843
What?

21:00.535 --> 21:02.882
Are you kidding?!

21:04.193 --> 21:06.851
Oh, my God!
This is actually insane!

21:06.955 --> 21:10.510
My business partner
needs to drive in style.

21:12.823 --> 21:14.411
Get in!

21:14.514 --> 21:16.654
Are you fucking
kidding me?

21:16.758 --> 21:18.173
- Winnie, language!
- What's the problem?

21:18.277 --> 21:19.657
Winnie, it's okay.
It's for both of us.

21:19.761 --> 21:21.625
I swear.
You drive it whenever you want.

21:21.728 --> 21:23.765
- It's ours.
- Nice try, Jimmy.

21:23.868 --> 21:25.663
But Dad gets me
a lesbian tracksuit?

21:25.767 --> 21:27.838
Hey!
We would never wear that.

21:27.941 --> 21:30.496
Sorry, Aunt Gale.

21:30.599 --> 21:31.842
And you get
a damn truck?

21:31.945 --> 21:35.811
We got you both
something you needed.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.194
Can everyone please stop

21:39.298 --> 21:42.093
ignoring what fucking happened
last year?

21:42.197 --> 21:43.405
People were killed.

21:43.509 --> 21:46.028
My best friend was killed.

21:46.132 --> 21:49.135
Cara and her grandpa spent
every Christmas here.

21:49.238 --> 21:51.068
How can you act
like nothing happened?

21:51.171 --> 21:54.658
Winnie, it's time
to let that go.

21:54.761 --> 21:56.867
Seriously?

21:56.970 --> 21:59.387
I killed Mr. Waters.

21:59.490 --> 22:01.975
I burnt him to a crisp.
And we never talk about it.

22:02.079 --> 22:05.393
The town never talks about it.

22:06.980 --> 22:09.569
Everyone just moved on.

22:09.673 --> 22:12.538
Winnie,
it's Christmas Eve.

22:12.641 --> 22:14.885
Why would you want
to relive that?

22:22.133 --> 22:28.070
It's got a 6.2-liter engine,
which is pretty amazing.

22:37.563 --> 22:39.875
Merry Christmas, kid.

22:42.326 --> 22:43.776
Ugh.

22:52.612 --> 22:55.304
Boyfriend Robbie?

22:55.408 --> 22:57.479
He's intense.

23:01.828 --> 23:04.348
♪ I'm so good and not bad

23:04.452 --> 23:06.488
♪ We could go far sometimes

23:06.592 --> 23:09.422
♪ Living how you're choosing

23:10.906 --> 23:12.874
Robbie?

23:18.707 --> 23:20.260
Vicki, hey, got a sec?

23:20.364 --> 23:21.503
What the fuck, dude?

23:21.607 --> 23:23.022
We're playing gummy
toss here.

23:23.125 --> 23:24.437
First to five wins.

23:24.541 --> 23:27.302
And I'm up four to two.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.062
Wow, cool.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.478
Who is this old asshole?

23:30.581 --> 23:31.893
Robbie's weird neighbor?

23:31.996 --> 23:34.309
I don't know. He brought
weed gummies, though.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.690
Want one?

23:35.793 --> 23:37.416
No.
Have you seen Robbie?

23:37.519 --> 23:39.279
No.
Check the basement.

23:39.383 --> 23:43.007
Mm! See that shit?
I win.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.220
Robbie?

23:57.574 --> 23:59.645
- Hey back.
- What?

23:59.748 --> 24:01.370
You said "hey" to me
last year at the party,

24:01.474 --> 24:04.822
and now I am saying
hey back.

24:04.926 --> 24:06.203
Mm-kay.

24:06.306 --> 24:07.618
It's Bernie, right?

24:07.722 --> 24:10.069
Yeah. It's--
it's Bernie.

24:10.172 --> 24:12.036
So, "It's Bernie"...

24:12.140 --> 24:13.555
Good.

24:13.659 --> 24:15.177
Have you seen my
dumb boyfriend Robbie?

24:15.281 --> 24:16.489
Yes.

24:16.593 --> 24:18.595
He's in the backyard.

24:18.698 --> 24:20.079
Will you
shut the hell up?

24:20.182 --> 24:21.425
I'm looking for Robbie.

24:21.529 --> 24:24.635
He's in the laundry room.

24:24.739 --> 24:26.154
I thought you said
he went outside?

24:26.257 --> 24:27.742
Yeah, I did
'cause that's...

24:27.845 --> 24:29.847
I just saw him there so--Weirdo's lying.

24:29.951 --> 24:32.091
He's in
the laundry room.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.785
Get out of here, Weirdo.

24:38.787 --> 24:40.824
You have very good aim.

24:48.245 --> 24:50.489
Wow. Just wow.

24:50.592 --> 24:52.801
Seriously?

24:52.905 --> 24:55.079
Hey, Winnie!

24:55.183 --> 24:57.530
Winnie, wait!

24:57.634 --> 24:58.911
Finally.

24:59.014 --> 25:01.051
I was so sick of just sneaking
around all the time.

25:01.154 --> 25:02.915
Finally?
Jesus, Darla.

25:03.018 --> 25:05.124
I catch you,
and you're relieved?

25:05.227 --> 25:07.126
Sort of. Yeah.

25:08.576 --> 25:10.681
Okay, well, you two suck.

25:10.785 --> 25:12.787
Sorry, but you're not
exactly present.

25:12.890 --> 25:14.340
Darla and I have been
doing this for a year,

25:14.443 --> 25:16.549
Winnie,
and you never noticed.

25:16.653 --> 25:18.171
A year?

25:18.275 --> 25:20.519
Shit, Win, we never meant
for you to find out this way.

25:20.622 --> 25:24.005
Robbie, it's sticking out!

25:24.108 --> 25:25.731
Winnie, wait.
Don't go--

25:25.834 --> 25:27.802
Wait. You were covering for
them, weren't you, Weirdo?

25:27.905 --> 25:29.217
No, no.
I was trying to protect you--

25:29.320 --> 25:31.599
I don't need
help from you!

25:48.961 --> 25:50.790
Shit.

26:39.701 --> 26:42.531
No school.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.362
No best friend.

26:45.465 --> 26:47.260
No boyfriend.

26:53.473 --> 26:56.166
No one cares.

26:56.269 --> 26:58.409
It's like I don't exist.

27:04.415 --> 27:08.488
Everyone would be better off...

27:08.592 --> 27:11.560
if I was...

27:11.664 --> 27:13.873
never born.

27:56.882 --> 27:58.124
Guys, did you see that?

27:58.228 --> 28:01.162
Did the power go out
or something?

28:03.440 --> 28:05.200
Oh, my God.

28:14.175 --> 28:16.384
Help me!

28:16.487 --> 28:18.041
Help!

28:33.366 --> 28:35.403
Help! I'm at the wharf near
Angel Park!

28:35.506 --> 28:36.645
Somebody's trying to kill me.

28:37.957 --> 28:39.200
Ma'am, did you
break my window?

28:39.303 --> 28:42.721
Buck, he's after me!
He was trying to kill me!

28:42.824 --> 28:45.585
The Angel?
What?

28:45.689 --> 28:47.070
Yes!

28:49.693 --> 28:53.110
Hey, Chuck.
I'm gonna need some backup.

28:56.079 --> 28:58.357
...some of that chalk
that we outline the people on.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.117
Can we get some more
of that caution tape?

29:00.221 --> 29:01.463
I feel like...

29:01.567 --> 29:04.570
I feel like we need to be
a little more cautious here.

29:04.673 --> 29:07.366
Chip, can we get
a canine unit down here?

29:07.469 --> 29:10.403
I-I don't think it's gonna help
catch him but it just...

29:10.507 --> 29:12.820
it helps the vibes, you know?

29:12.923 --> 29:15.961
This looks pretty good.
I mean, not this spot.

29:16.064 --> 29:17.479
Obviously... Buck.

29:17.583 --> 29:18.826
Yeah?

29:18.929 --> 29:22.105
When did
you become a cop?

29:22.208 --> 29:23.244
Do I know you?

29:23.347 --> 29:25.004
Where is the sheriff?

29:25.108 --> 29:26.695
I'm the sheriff.
Sheriff Waters.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.595
Show me some respect.

29:29.698 --> 29:32.356
Okay.
What is going on?

29:32.460 --> 29:34.842
Where's Sheriff Beatty,
and why's everyone acting

29:34.945 --> 29:36.291
like this
is no big deal?

29:36.395 --> 29:37.637
Ma'am--
It's Winnie.

29:37.741 --> 29:39.778
- You know that.
- Okay. Winnie.

29:39.881 --> 29:42.711
Sheriff Beatty was murdered
almost a year ago.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.921
I've been in charge
ever since.

29:46.405 --> 29:47.682
You're joking.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.304
It's true.

29:49.408 --> 29:51.306
Sheriff Beatty was killed

29:51.410 --> 29:52.860
shortly after
the Angel Park murders.

29:52.963 --> 29:55.000
He was
victim number five.

29:55.103 --> 29:57.002
Five?

29:57.105 --> 29:58.866
Have there been
more than five?

29:58.969 --> 29:59.901
How many have there been?

30:00.005 --> 30:02.386
Well, this is, uh...

30:02.490 --> 30:03.940
26 or 27?

30:04.043 --> 30:06.839
The Angel strikes
every couple of weeks.

30:08.427 --> 30:11.982
How can that be?
Everyone knows who did it.

30:12.086 --> 30:14.329
You know who did this?

30:14.433 --> 30:16.435
Who did this?

30:16.538 --> 30:17.850
Your... Man: Hey!

30:17.954 --> 30:19.093
- ...brother.
- Is this her?

30:19.196 --> 30:20.059
Yeah.

30:20.163 --> 30:21.302
You never had
a witness before.

30:21.405 --> 30:22.475
- Yeah.
- Huh, Buck?

30:22.579 --> 30:24.650
Hi. Hi. I'm Henry Waters.

30:24.753 --> 30:26.894
You okay? You're okay.
It's okay.

30:26.997 --> 30:29.862
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
Easy, easy.

30:29.966 --> 30:32.865
Yeah, I'm gonna invade
your personal space.

30:32.969 --> 30:36.696
I want you to know, you have
this town's full support.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.491
Anything you need,
you just...

30:38.595 --> 30:40.183
you just let
Uncle Buck know.

30:40.286 --> 30:41.736
Now, as mayor,
I want you to know

30:41.840 --> 30:45.050
that you have a friend here
in Angel Falls.

30:45.153 --> 30:50.227
Now, are you just visiting our
town, or do have family here?

30:50.952 --> 30:53.092
Oh, she... she can't talk,
she's so scared.

30:53.196 --> 30:56.268
It's okay.
You're all right.

30:56.371 --> 30:58.580
She says
she knows who did it.

31:01.721 --> 31:04.000
Is that so?

31:04.103 --> 31:07.175
I-I don't know, actually.

31:07.279 --> 31:08.280
I misspoke.

31:08.383 --> 31:10.592
I was chased, but then
he disappeared.

31:10.696 --> 31:13.664
Never saw his face.
Wish I did.

31:13.768 --> 31:15.597
Well, lucky you.

31:17.289 --> 31:20.602
He was about
your height, Mayor.

31:24.986 --> 31:27.506
Anything else?

31:27.609 --> 31:29.404
Nope.

31:33.788 --> 31:35.272
Don't you have
stuff to do, Buck?

31:35.376 --> 31:37.481
- A report to file?
- Well, I--

31:37.585 --> 31:40.346
Why don't you keep an eye
on that girl?

31:40.450 --> 31:42.383
In which order?

32:05.061 --> 32:08.029
Mom.
Oh, thank God.

32:09.858 --> 32:12.965
Mom.
Are you drunk?

32:13.069 --> 32:14.415
What are you doing here?

32:14.518 --> 32:19.075
I clicked the option to leave
the pizza on the porch.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.044
Where's Jimmy?
Jimmy?!

32:23.148 --> 32:24.632
Jimmy, are you here?

32:24.735 --> 32:26.599
Hey.

32:26.703 --> 32:28.118
What's going on?
Who are you?

32:28.222 --> 32:30.224
Dad, where's Jimmy?

32:30.327 --> 32:32.019
What?

32:32.122 --> 32:34.918
Is this a joke?
Huh?

32:35.022 --> 32:36.299
It's not funny.

32:40.510 --> 32:41.787
Jimmy?!

32:41.890 --> 32:43.271
Hey!

32:43.375 --> 32:44.479
Shh.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.585
Jimmy?!

32:58.804 --> 33:01.531
You're looking
for Jimmy? Why?

33:01.634 --> 33:03.291
I need to find him.

33:03.395 --> 33:04.258
What for?

33:04.361 --> 33:07.433
I just...
I need his help.

33:07.537 --> 33:10.712
Oh, honey...

33:10.816 --> 33:12.956
Jimmy is...

33:13.060 --> 33:15.027
dead.

33:17.547 --> 33:18.410
No, no. I...

33:18.513 --> 33:20.791
That's not...
that's not possible.

33:20.895 --> 33:22.690
I'm so sorry.
I saved him.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.623
I swear.

33:24.726 --> 33:26.073
I swear I saved him.

33:26.176 --> 33:27.695
You need to get
out of here.

33:27.798 --> 33:29.352
Just go easy on her.
I think she's in shock.

33:29.455 --> 33:32.251
My son was murdered
a year ago.

33:32.355 --> 33:35.358
I had one kid.
Now I have none.

33:35.461 --> 33:38.361
You need to get out
of this house.

33:38.464 --> 33:40.259
I'm sorry.

34:08.425 --> 34:11.911
<i>Citizens of Angel Falls,
this is your favorite mayor</i>

34:12.015 --> 34:17.124
<i>reminding you all that
it's one hour until curfew.</i>

34:17.227 --> 34:20.748
<i>Why not head inside early
and make some cocoa?</i>

34:45.393 --> 34:49.777
Henry Waters.
He owns it all.

35:50.665 --> 35:52.219
Weird neighbor Pete.

35:52.322 --> 35:55.670
Vicki.
What's in the pipe?

35:55.774 --> 35:57.085
Some good old crank.

35:57.189 --> 35:59.329
Cut the shit.

36:03.333 --> 36:06.233
Have you seen Robbie?
Or Darla?

36:06.336 --> 36:09.132
I need their help.

36:09.236 --> 36:11.238
Hello?

36:31.913 --> 36:33.881
Oh, my God. Bernie.

36:35.986 --> 36:36.918
Hi.

36:37.022 --> 36:38.092
You know me?

36:38.196 --> 36:39.576
No.

36:39.680 --> 36:42.545
Then why are you
acting like you do?

36:42.648 --> 36:43.753
I don't know.

36:43.856 --> 36:45.582
Okay.
Weird story.

36:45.686 --> 36:49.103
I think I'm dead
or invisible.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.794
Mm. I can see you.

36:50.898 --> 36:54.039
We all can see you so you're not
dead or invisible.

36:54.142 --> 36:56.041
Right, right.
No, I totally get that.

36:56.144 --> 36:59.182
It's just, you don't
know me, right?

36:59.286 --> 37:00.425
That's right.
I don't.

37:00.528 --> 37:02.150
And no one else
here knows me.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.738
Yo, Tara,
do you know me?

37:03.842 --> 37:05.844
No.

37:07.570 --> 37:09.088
Yo, Chad, do you know me?

37:09.192 --> 37:10.055
I'd like to.

37:10.158 --> 37:11.470
Ew, barf, no, bye.

37:11.574 --> 37:13.334
See? No one knows me.

37:13.438 --> 37:16.337
No one in this whole town
knows me.

37:16.441 --> 37:19.927
So, um, who are you?

37:20.030 --> 37:24.656
I'm Winnie Carruthers.
I'm Jimmy Carruthers' sister.

37:24.759 --> 37:26.002
Okay.

37:26.105 --> 37:28.798
That's super effed up.
You're just playing with me?

37:28.901 --> 37:30.178
You're trying to get me
to freak out.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.456
Someone will point
and laugh at me?

37:31.559 --> 37:33.181
God, this while school
messes with me.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.459
This is, like,
next-level gross.

37:34.562 --> 37:36.495
Bernie, we go to school together.

37:36.599 --> 37:39.671
I don't think that we do.

37:39.774 --> 37:41.293
We did.

37:41.397 --> 37:43.537
You got to help me.

37:47.679 --> 37:49.681
Robbie and Darla.
They're the "it" couple.

37:49.784 --> 37:50.923
This is his house.

37:51.027 --> 37:52.200
I know.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.719
Invisible a minute ago,

37:53.823 --> 37:55.618
and now she knows whose
house this is.

37:55.721 --> 37:56.964
It's like
make up your mind.

38:00.139 --> 38:01.934
Robbie.

38:02.038 --> 38:04.592
Darla.

38:04.696 --> 38:06.318
That's us.

38:06.422 --> 38:08.631
Are you two in love?

38:08.734 --> 38:12.186
Three years strong. Yeah.

38:12.290 --> 38:16.086
You know our names.
What's yours?

38:16.190 --> 38:18.537
Winnie.

38:18.641 --> 38:22.369
Okay, well, uh,
good to know ya, Winnie.

38:39.386 --> 38:40.939
Shit!

38:43.079 --> 38:44.908
Kick me!
Kick me in the junk!

38:47.497 --> 38:49.568
What the hell
are you doing?

38:49.672 --> 38:52.330
What does
it look like, bro?

38:52.433 --> 38:55.505
He's kicking my ass!

38:56.644 --> 38:58.577
What is this town?

39:00.614 --> 39:02.961
♪ Holy fucking shit

39:03.064 --> 39:05.066
♪ It's Christmas

39:09.416 --> 39:11.797
The lights look so cool.

39:20.427 --> 39:23.153
Oh, my God,
there's been more murders.

39:23.257 --> 39:24.776
So?
So?

39:24.879 --> 39:26.743
Dude, people died.

39:26.847 --> 39:27.882
More people.

39:27.986 --> 39:29.505
So fuckin' what?

39:29.608 --> 39:33.923
Am I just supposed to
stop living life?

39:34.026 --> 39:36.581
Live in perpetual fear?

39:36.684 --> 39:39.273
Let it kill my buzz?
Come on.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.207
I must be drunk to keep
listening to this.

39:42.310 --> 39:43.829
What did I say?

39:43.933 --> 39:45.590
Really drunk.

39:46.694 --> 39:49.456
I am so misunderstood.

40:05.782 --> 40:07.784
Ah!

40:19.486 --> 40:21.177
Help me!

40:31.152 --> 40:33.154
Open the fucking door!

40:53.830 --> 40:55.107
Please.

41:27.312 --> 41:29.866
They really are in love.

41:46.883 --> 41:50.128
Carruthers, Carruthers, Carruthers.

41:50.231 --> 41:52.164
Then I'm really gone.

42:08.180 --> 42:09.872
<i>Unfortunately,
citizens of Angel Falls,</i>

42:09.975 --> 42:12.771
<i>the killer did strike again.</i>

42:12.875 --> 42:15.843
<i>But know that I am
working on it.</i>

42:15.947 --> 42:17.707
<i>I'm going to solve this.</i>

42:17.811 --> 42:20.952
<i>My men are more than equipped
to handle the situation.</i>

42:21.055 --> 42:22.954
<i>So please take
comfort in that</i>

42:23.057 --> 42:26.267
Weirdo.
Weirdo, I'm talking to you.

42:26.371 --> 42:28.649
Why are you showing up
everywhere?

42:28.753 --> 42:30.202
We don't want you here.

42:30.306 --> 42:33.827
Murders for a year,
and you have a party?

42:33.930 --> 42:37.140
Murders for a year, and you
still treat her like shit?

42:37.244 --> 42:38.797
Plus, the drugs?

42:38.901 --> 42:40.903
We're mourning, okay?

42:41.006 --> 42:42.283
Quit pursing
your lips, Vicki.

42:42.387 --> 42:44.803
Your mouth looks
like an asshole.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.497
Come on, Weirdo.
Let's fuckin' go.

42:49.601 --> 42:52.052
Who are you?

42:52.155 --> 42:54.123
Great party.

42:56.125 --> 42:59.024
My mouth doesn't look
like an asshole.

43:00.129 --> 43:01.440
Oh, my God,
did you see their face?

43:01.544 --> 43:03.063
Oh, no.
I hope that they don't think

43:03.166 --> 43:04.858
about that every day
for the rest of their life.

43:04.961 --> 43:06.204
Do you think--
Bernie, wait.

43:06.307 --> 43:07.446
What?

43:07.550 --> 43:09.069
The killer is still
out there, right?

43:09.172 --> 43:10.622
Very much so. Yeah.

43:10.726 --> 43:13.073
We got to stop him.

43:13.176 --> 43:15.938
Come with me.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.735
Oh, stupid Pete,
stupid Weirdo.

43:19.838 --> 43:23.497
And that other girl?
Who is that?

43:23.773 --> 43:25.741
My God, I don't care.

43:52.975 --> 43:55.460
Are you always alone
for Christmas?

43:55.563 --> 43:58.187
My dad caught my mom.

43:58.290 --> 43:59.809
He left when
I was little,

43:59.913 --> 44:02.536
and, uh, my mom's usually
with whatever ass bucket

44:02.640 --> 44:05.539
she's dating, so...

44:05.643 --> 44:09.060
I do the best I can.

44:09.163 --> 44:11.096
It's nice, Bernie.

44:23.246 --> 44:25.007
You designed these?

44:25.110 --> 44:26.767
And these.

44:26.871 --> 44:28.596
If I can ever scrounge up
the money,

44:28.700 --> 44:30.150
I'm going to New York.

44:30.253 --> 44:31.738
Fashion school.

44:31.841 --> 44:35.155
Really?
NYCU was my plan, too.

44:36.501 --> 44:37.571
Was.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.262
Photography.

44:39.366 --> 44:40.678
Didn't end up
working out.

44:40.781 --> 44:43.404
Maybe it will and we'll end up
there together.

44:47.546 --> 44:49.169
Whoa.

44:49.272 --> 44:50.895
You did this?

44:50.998 --> 44:53.552
It's kept me going.

44:53.656 --> 44:54.968
Wait.
What do you mean by that?

44:55.071 --> 44:57.798
The victims have been
mostly teenagers.

44:57.902 --> 45:01.215
And he murders
every few weeks.

45:01.319 --> 45:03.252
It's Henry Waters.

45:05.357 --> 45:07.601
You don't believe me.

45:07.705 --> 45:08.878
I mean...

45:08.982 --> 45:11.950
I stood under the aurora
and said everyone

45:12.054 --> 45:15.195
would be better off
if I never existed.

45:15.298 --> 45:16.575
Well, wish granted.

45:16.679 --> 45:21.546
Because I'm seeing what
Angel Falls is like without me.

45:21.649 --> 45:24.273
Everyone at school
calls you Weirdo.

45:24.376 --> 45:27.932
Not like "a weirdo,"
they literally named you Weirdo.

45:28.035 --> 45:30.210
How would I know that?

45:30.313 --> 45:32.799
You heard that tonight
from Vicki.

45:32.902 --> 45:35.042
Just hear me out.

45:35.146 --> 45:38.149
Last Christmas Eve,
Mr. Evans was murdered

45:38.252 --> 45:39.460
in his home first.

45:39.564 --> 45:42.084
Then Eddie and Cara
were murdered at the park party.

45:42.187 --> 45:44.672
Plus...

45:44.776 --> 45:46.536
Jimmy.

45:49.091 --> 45:51.334
Well, in the version
where I still exist,

45:51.438 --> 45:54.682
I killed the killer,
and it was Henry Waters.

45:54.786 --> 45:57.996
He killed Eddie and Cara and
then he came after me and Jimmy.

45:58.100 --> 46:00.930
But I killed him.
I saved Jimmy.

46:01.034 --> 46:02.173
You took out the killer,

46:02.276 --> 46:03.691
and you're saying
it was Mayor Waters.

46:03.795 --> 46:06.349
It was!

46:07.178 --> 46:08.938
Oh, God.

46:13.494 --> 46:15.773
I wasn't there
to save him.

46:17.809 --> 46:20.708
And now he's dead.

46:20.812 --> 46:22.710
All the offed teenagers
were part of families

46:22.814 --> 46:24.851
with businesses in town.

46:24.954 --> 46:27.439
Or they <i>had</i> businesses
in town.

46:27.543 --> 46:29.752
Had?
The kids died.

46:29.856 --> 46:31.029
And then
the businesses died.

46:31.133 --> 46:32.548
And then you weren't
around to stop him,

46:32.651 --> 46:35.275
so he just kept going.

46:35.378 --> 46:37.933
And now he owns
the whole damn town.

46:38.036 --> 46:41.350
It's like everyone
just gave up.

46:41.453 --> 46:44.249
And he likes killing.

46:45.975 --> 46:47.045
Look, I want to
believe you.

46:47.149 --> 46:50.324
I mean, it makes sense.

46:50.428 --> 46:52.292
Henry Waters is a twat.
He's now mayor.

46:52.395 --> 46:55.295
He killed the last sheriff so
his TikTok cock dumb-ass brother

46:55.398 --> 46:57.331
Buck could take over,
which makes

46:57.435 --> 47:01.197
Mayor Waters untouchable.

47:01.301 --> 47:04.787
But let's say
you're just...

47:04.891 --> 47:06.651
you're some girl...

47:06.754 --> 47:14.210
some potentially crazy girl
no one knows.

47:15.177 --> 47:19.077
And the day you reveal
yourself in town

47:19.181 --> 47:22.632
is the day there's
another...

47:22.736 --> 47:24.358
massacre.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.228
And then another murder

47:32.332 --> 47:35.059
at the party
we were just at.

47:35.162 --> 47:36.232
What?

47:36.336 --> 47:39.649
Pete was killed at
the party, Winnie.

47:39.753 --> 47:41.375
But I was with you.

47:41.479 --> 47:44.102
You went outside alone.

47:44.206 --> 47:47.071
Come on, Bernie!
It wasn't me!

47:47.174 --> 47:49.176
How can I be so sure?

47:53.525 --> 47:55.734
Come on, come on!

48:01.948 --> 48:04.122
Ah!

48:10.611 --> 48:11.716
Go, go, go!

48:11.819 --> 48:13.131
Holy crap,
you aren't the killer!

48:13.235 --> 48:14.857
You're telling the truth!
You don't exist!

48:14.961 --> 48:16.238
You're George Bailey!

48:16.341 --> 48:17.825
Will you be
my Clarence?

48:17.929 --> 48:19.172
Absolutely!

48:19.275 --> 48:23.176
<i>Citizens of Angel Falls,</i>

48:23.279 --> 48:25.212
<i>this is your mayor,
reminding you</i>

48:25.316 --> 48:26.524
<i>to have a safe
and Merry Christmas!</i>

48:26.627 --> 48:28.422
Wait, wait.
Hold on.

48:28.526 --> 48:30.666
<i>It's curfew time!</i>

48:32.219 --> 48:34.463
Oh, it's so pretty.

48:34.566 --> 48:37.845
It exploded
when I made my wish.

48:37.949 --> 48:40.020
It shouldn't be here.

48:40.124 --> 48:41.573
What do you mean?

48:41.677 --> 48:43.748
I mean it's super rare to see
an aurora from our town.

48:43.851 --> 48:46.302
We aren't close enough
to the Arctic.

48:46.406 --> 48:47.994
But it's here.

48:48.097 --> 48:50.099
And so are you.

48:53.309 --> 48:55.725
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

49:01.352 --> 49:02.732
Come on.

49:07.254 --> 49:08.359
Is this still open?

49:08.462 --> 49:09.912
Yeah, it's the only
thing in town

49:10.016 --> 49:11.431
Henry Waters doesn't own.

49:11.534 --> 49:13.536
How do we get in?

49:13.640 --> 49:15.124
I work here.

49:15.228 --> 49:17.540
Huh.

49:19.335 --> 49:21.786
We're safe here
overnight, Winnie.

49:21.889 --> 49:24.064
Loosen those shoulders.

49:24.168 --> 49:26.446
This is my happy place.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.702
<i>A Merry Christmas
to you, uncle!</i>

49:41.806 --> 49:43.118
Thank you. <i>And God save you!</i>

49:43.221 --> 49:45.154
<i>Bah! Humbug! Christmas a humbug?</i>

49:45.258 --> 49:46.328
<i>You can't mean that,
I'm sure.</i>

49:46.431 --> 49:47.881
This is one
of my favorites.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.365
<i>What right have
you to be merry?</i>

49:49.469 --> 49:51.264
<i>What reason have you
to be merry?</i>

49:51.367 --> 49:53.231
<i>You're poor enough. Come, then.</i>

49:53.335 --> 49:54.543
<i>What right have you
to be dismal?</i>

49:54.646 --> 49:56.165
<i>What reason have you
to be morose?</i>

49:56.269 --> 49:57.718
<i>You're rich enough.</i>

49:57.822 --> 50:00.169
Win?

50:00.273 --> 50:03.517
Did being unborn hurt?

50:05.174 --> 50:07.038
I'm tired, Bernie.

50:07.142 --> 50:09.109
Can we not?

50:12.216 --> 50:14.287
- What?
- I have so many questions.

50:16.841 --> 50:19.119
What?

50:19.223 --> 50:23.123
It didn't hurt.
It just sort of... happened.

50:23.227 --> 50:26.264
So, no plasma or goo
or anything?

50:26.368 --> 50:27.748
I would just imagine
it's like...

50:27.852 --> 50:30.544
it's like
reverse childbirth.

50:30.648 --> 50:34.100
Where do you come up
with this kind of stuff?

50:34.203 --> 50:36.205
Why are you here?

50:36.309 --> 50:40.968
In this... reality?

50:41.072 --> 50:43.661
To learn some lesson?

50:43.764 --> 50:45.421
To appreciate life?

50:45.525 --> 50:48.183
I learned
that lesson quickly.

50:53.636 --> 50:56.881
I do wish I was born.

50:56.984 --> 50:59.504
I wish Jimmy was alive.

51:02.093 --> 51:05.096
See? Nothing.

51:11.999 --> 51:15.934
I know we just met,

51:16.038 --> 51:19.628
but I have no doubt this town
was better with you in it.

51:47.034 --> 51:48.277
A <i>Merry Christmas to you!</i>

51:48.381 --> 51:50.935
<i>A Merry Christmas!</i>

52:09.954 --> 52:11.783
Bernie?

52:12.888 --> 52:14.200
Bernie?

52:14.303 --> 52:15.511
Good morning!

52:15.615 --> 52:17.686
I couldn't sleep at all.
You snore so loud.

52:17.789 --> 52:19.688
But look what I found.

52:23.692 --> 52:24.796
Do you shoot?

52:24.900 --> 52:26.177
Oh, I try.

52:26.281 --> 52:28.006
I mean, it's probably
not as good as you.

52:28.110 --> 52:30.147
I can barely get a photo
in focus.

52:32.079 --> 52:33.909
You stayed up all night
doing this?

52:34.012 --> 52:35.876
Yeah, I live
for this kind of shit.

52:35.980 --> 52:37.878
The aurora
is why you're here.

52:37.982 --> 52:41.365
It's rare for it to be seen
in our town, but it does happen.

52:41.468 --> 52:42.849
And local folklore says
the lights

52:42.952 --> 52:45.334
are the spirit of someone
who died violently.

52:45.438 --> 52:46.680
- Henry Waters.
- Yeah.

52:46.784 --> 52:48.544
You killed him
in your world, right?

52:48.648 --> 52:50.132
Violently.

52:50.236 --> 52:52.514
His spirit sent you here, Winnie.

52:52.617 --> 52:54.067
And...

52:54.171 --> 52:56.242
there's more.

52:56.345 --> 52:58.416
The aurora's fading.

53:00.246 --> 53:03.594
And if it fades
away completely,

53:03.697 --> 53:04.905
I'm stuck here.

53:05.009 --> 53:06.942
Exactly.

53:07.045 --> 53:08.254
What do I do?

53:08.357 --> 53:10.842
My best guess?
Kill him again.

53:10.946 --> 53:12.223
Before
the aurora disappears.

53:12.327 --> 53:16.227
You'll get your wish
to go back and reset...

53:16.331 --> 53:18.229
everything.

53:20.473 --> 53:21.301
Yay!

53:21.405 --> 53:23.372
Merry Christmas.

53:30.448 --> 53:32.070
This is tonight?

53:32.174 --> 53:33.796
Yep.

53:33.900 --> 53:38.180
A new Christmas festival in town
gifted to us by Mayor Waters.

53:38.284 --> 53:40.044
"Are you
naughty or nice?

53:40.147 --> 53:43.185
Only Henry Waters
can answer that?"

53:43.289 --> 53:45.187
This could be
our only chance.

53:45.291 --> 53:46.499
How do we get to him?

53:46.602 --> 53:49.674
This whole town is
basically up his ass.

53:49.778 --> 53:53.091
I think there's one person
who can help us.

53:53.195 --> 53:56.060
He's closer to Henry Waters
than anybody.

54:01.203 --> 54:02.515
You again.

54:02.618 --> 54:04.171
I just need
to talk to you.

54:04.275 --> 54:06.035
It's about Jimmy.

54:08.866 --> 54:10.902
I'm not going away
until you talk to me!

54:11.006 --> 54:15.010
I don't exist, man!
I can do this all day!

54:17.046 --> 54:18.151
Subtle.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.980
I need to talk to him.

54:21.706 --> 54:24.640
Tell me how
you know Jimmy.

54:26.332 --> 54:28.265
Make something up.

54:30.750 --> 54:33.166
He's my brother.
And you're my aunt.

54:33.270 --> 54:35.548
Oh.
Can I come in?

54:36.307 --> 54:37.619
I'm your aunt?

54:37.722 --> 54:39.276
Yes.
You're my mom's sister.

54:39.379 --> 54:42.658
Dad works for Henry Waters.

54:42.762 --> 54:46.213
Okay, tell me something
you can't Google.

54:46.938 --> 54:48.768
Your ass froze to the ground
because you were rocking

54:48.871 --> 54:53.497
an Aguilerean thong at the 1999
Christmas Eve park party.

54:57.294 --> 54:59.330
I always knew that
thong would bring people

54:59.434 --> 55:01.539
together one day.

55:04.093 --> 55:07.165
What's an Aguilerean thong?

55:07.580 --> 55:10.962
Judy! What did I say?
No more wine.

55:14.138 --> 55:16.485
Leave her alone.

55:16.589 --> 55:19.868
Do you have my Ambien?

55:19.971 --> 55:21.179
Do you have her Ambien?

55:21.283 --> 55:22.319
Who is that?

55:22.422 --> 55:25.391
Uh, you don't
want to know.

55:25.494 --> 55:30.775
I mean, he's upstairs
if you really want...

55:35.401 --> 55:37.610
You have a lovely home.

56:06.673 --> 56:09.366
Working on Christmas?

56:09.469 --> 56:11.989
For Mr. Waters.

56:12.092 --> 56:13.887
Always.

56:16.373 --> 56:18.167
Are you okay?

56:24.415 --> 56:27.763
You want to talk
about Jimmy?

56:27.867 --> 56:30.732
You knew him?

56:30.835 --> 56:32.596
Yeah.

56:33.942 --> 56:35.702
He was...

56:35.806 --> 56:37.601
great.

56:39.844 --> 56:41.708
Yeah, he was.

56:42.778 --> 56:46.333
I used to go to school
with Jimmy.

56:46.437 --> 56:49.198
I loved
watching him play.

56:49.302 --> 56:52.236
Yeah.
He was all-state.

56:52.339 --> 56:53.824
Two years in a row.

56:53.927 --> 56:58.656
I remember this one game,
he threw for six touchdowns.

56:58.760 --> 57:02.108
He was so, so, so good.

57:02.211 --> 57:04.524
I remember that.

57:04.628 --> 57:09.080
That was
the state semis.

57:09.184 --> 57:12.256
I got so
excited that I...

57:12.359 --> 57:15.017
that I spilled hot cocoa--

57:15.121 --> 57:16.640
All over your pants.

57:16.743 --> 57:17.917
Yeah.

57:18.020 --> 57:21.955
Jimmy always lit up
when he told me that story.

57:22.059 --> 57:24.130
God, I miss him so much.

57:26.304 --> 57:28.514
So do I.

57:28.617 --> 57:31.655
You know,
it's really something.

57:31.758 --> 57:36.487
One person, one life,

57:36.591 --> 57:41.388
can change everything,
just by being gone.

57:41.492 --> 57:43.701
And they don't
even know it.

57:43.805 --> 57:47.084
And they are so lucky that
they don't get to see the pain

57:47.187 --> 57:49.466
they left in their wake.

57:50.639 --> 57:54.056
And they should
be so lucky.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.713
Could you imagine?

57:55.817 --> 57:58.198
What seeing this could do
to a person?

58:02.375 --> 58:04.446
I know who killed him.

58:04.550 --> 58:07.449
Oh, come on.
Don't start this.

58:07.553 --> 58:09.416
I was there that night.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.626
I saw what happened.

58:11.729 --> 58:13.248
What do you mean?

58:13.351 --> 58:18.391
If you were there, why didn't
you say something then?

58:18.495 --> 58:20.497
I couldn't.

58:22.257 --> 58:25.053
It was Mr. Waters.

58:25.156 --> 58:28.401
It was Henry Waters?

58:28.505 --> 58:30.161
My best friend?

58:30.265 --> 58:32.785
My boss?

58:32.888 --> 58:34.338
You're saying he
killed my son?

58:34.441 --> 58:36.513
Yes.
We need to stop him.

58:36.616 --> 58:38.376
Goddamnit!

58:38.480 --> 58:40.482
Why did you come
here again? Huh?

58:40.586 --> 58:42.588
Why are you so intent
on hurting my family?

58:42.691 --> 58:46.695
Dad, he killed Jimmy!

58:46.799 --> 58:48.145
Dad?

58:48.248 --> 58:49.146
What?

58:49.249 --> 58:50.906
You called me dad.

58:51.010 --> 58:52.045
No. I-I just--

58:52.149 --> 58:54.358
I'm not your dad.
I have no children.

58:54.461 --> 58:55.635
You need to get out
of the house, go.

58:55.739 --> 58:57.085
- He killed Jimmy.
- Goddamnit!

58:57.188 --> 59:00.502
The guy that you are accusing
of murder right now,

59:00.606 --> 59:01.710
he got me this house.

59:01.814 --> 59:03.229
He feeds this family.

59:03.332 --> 59:05.887
He paid for the burial
of my son!

59:05.990 --> 59:08.165
So, get the fuck
out of here!

59:08.268 --> 59:10.063
Go!

59:13.032 --> 59:15.206
Are you okay?

59:16.760 --> 59:19.694
Hey, it's okay.

59:24.906 --> 59:28.703
My family, this town...

59:31.153 --> 59:35.019
...it died that night
with Jimmy.

59:36.849 --> 59:39.265
I got to fix this.

59:45.305 --> 59:50.034
Uh, why is that
strange man kissing your neck?

59:50.138 --> 59:52.209
Don't let that bastard scream
at you like that.

59:52.312 --> 59:56.316
Yeah. Don't let that bastard
scream at you like that.

59:56.420 --> 59:58.387
Who are you?

59:58.491 --> 01:00:01.943
Who are you?

01:00:02.357 --> 01:00:04.014
Mom has a side piece?

01:00:04.117 --> 01:00:05.567
Pieces, plural.

01:00:05.671 --> 01:00:08.121
Told you you
didn't want to know.

01:00:08.225 --> 01:00:09.467
Goddamn mess.

01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:13.057
You heard me, Judy?
You're a goddamn mess!

01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:15.094
I didn't realize
that was your mom.

01:00:15.197 --> 01:00:17.303
David is not the man
he used to be.

01:00:17.406 --> 01:00:19.892
Well, that's true.
He comes and goes at all hours.

01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:21.583
Even in the middle
of the night.

01:00:21.687 --> 01:00:24.379
Oh, look, there he fucking
goes again!

01:00:26.105 --> 01:00:27.175
You're not nice.

01:00:27.278 --> 01:00:29.556
Regardless, my husband
thinks he's tough.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.628
Don't let him
trick you!

01:00:31.731 --> 01:00:33.388
Wait, Winnie.

01:00:33.491 --> 01:00:36.943
They don't even know
that they're your family, right?

01:00:37.047 --> 01:00:39.049
I know it sucks.
I've seen like a zillion randos

01:00:39.152 --> 01:00:43.122
playing tonsil hockey
with my mom, but...

01:00:43.225 --> 01:00:44.744
we need them.

01:00:44.848 --> 01:00:46.781
We need someone.

01:00:50.716 --> 01:00:54.098
Aunt Gale!
That guy needs to leave.

01:00:57.757 --> 01:00:59.483
Mom! No!

01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:01.830
No! Gale, we got to go,
we got to go!

01:01:01.934 --> 01:01:04.246
Come on!

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.523
Winnie, let's go!

01:01:08.768 --> 01:01:10.425
Go, go, go!

01:01:19.399 --> 01:01:21.160
Stop!

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:31.273
We have
to step over him.

01:01:53.364 --> 01:01:55.470
Go.

01:02:04.341 --> 01:02:06.032
He's still breathing.

01:02:06.136 --> 01:02:09.726
That's okay.
I got you.

01:02:22.635 --> 01:02:24.464
Okay, come on.

01:02:54.115 --> 01:02:55.979
What are you doing?

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.466
I have to kill him.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.779
Yes, you can do it, Winnie.

01:03:27.734 --> 01:03:29.495
Dad.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.844
I told you...

01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:36.260
I'm not your dad.

01:03:57.903 --> 01:04:00.112
It's almost gone.

01:04:10.743 --> 01:04:12.538
That should be good.

01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:19.441
I can't believe my dad
is the one doing this.

01:04:19.545 --> 01:04:22.789
First Karen
and now Judy.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:24.101
I just...

01:04:24.205 --> 01:04:26.863
Karen?

01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:29.451
He killed her
this past summer.

01:04:29.555 --> 01:04:34.146
And then Waters took over
her print shop a week later.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.772
I saw something
in his eyes.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.568
My dad is not fully...

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:43.914
my dad.

01:04:44.018 --> 01:04:46.986
His eyes have felt
like that for a year.

01:04:49.023 --> 01:04:52.440
The aurora, Jimmy...

01:04:54.338 --> 01:04:56.996
Jimmy's murder broke my dad.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.791
Waters already owned him.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:00.448
Now he controls him.

01:05:00.551 --> 01:05:04.107
Just like everyone else
whose life he destroyed.

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:05.936
So, Waters did
the first killing?

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.319
And is using my dad
to punish his competition.

01:05:09.422 --> 01:05:13.564
Making him kill in order
to expand his empire.

01:05:14.669 --> 01:05:16.843
We can still
change it back.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:19.777
Kill the killer.
Remember?

01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:21.158
- Hold up.
- You saw the aurora.

01:05:21.262 --> 01:05:22.919
It's gonna
disappear tonight.

01:05:23.022 --> 01:05:26.060
Once it's gone,
there could be no stopping him.

01:05:26.163 --> 01:05:28.821
I have to kill my own dad?

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.098
Correct.

01:05:30.202 --> 01:05:31.237
Good.

01:05:31.341 --> 01:05:33.032
Look, you can think of it
as a dream, right?

01:05:33.136 --> 01:05:34.896
You kill him,
then you wake up.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.001
And you get
your life back.

01:05:36.104 --> 01:05:38.141
Weirdo is right, kid.

01:05:38.244 --> 01:05:40.005
You're an unexpected wrinkle.

01:05:40.108 --> 01:05:41.903
Your dad did not
plan on you.

01:05:42.007 --> 01:05:44.423
You are his target now, Winnie.

01:05:44.526 --> 01:05:47.357
If you don't kill him,
he'll kill you.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.154
And so many others
in this town.

01:05:51.257 --> 01:05:52.949
So...

01:05:53.052 --> 01:05:55.054
what's our plan?

01:05:55.158 --> 01:05:58.299
We lure him here.

01:05:58.402 --> 01:06:00.680
All right.

01:06:00.784 --> 01:06:03.200
Let's kill my not-dad dad.

01:06:16.317 --> 01:06:17.974
Man on screen: <i>I do mean it.</i>

01:06:18.077 --> 01:06:19.941
<i>What right have you
to be merry?</i>

01:06:20.045 --> 01:06:21.598
<i>What reason have you
to be merry?</i>

01:06:21.701 --> 01:06:23.980
<i>You're poor enough.</i>

01:06:38.856 --> 01:06:40.617
Now, Winnie!

01:06:42.136 --> 01:06:45.622
But, Robbie, I can't see!

01:06:45.725 --> 01:06:46.726
Come on down, Bernie.

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:49.108
It's just
Robbie and Darla.

01:06:50.972 --> 01:06:52.525
Is that
a baseball bat?

01:06:52.629 --> 01:06:53.733
Why are you here?

01:06:53.837 --> 01:06:55.804
We had our first date here.
It's a tradition.

01:06:55.908 --> 01:06:58.083
Yeah, they're
kind of here a lot.

01:06:58.186 --> 01:06:59.498
Ugh. These two. I can't.

01:06:59.601 --> 01:07:02.018
So, why did you
attack us on our thirdiversary?

01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:04.606
Of course
it's your anniversary.

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:07.713
Yeah, we are so lucky
that we started dating

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:09.128
on Christmas Eve.

01:07:09.232 --> 01:07:11.406
So lucky.
Yes, we are.

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:13.546
- Blech!
- Blech.

01:07:31.806 --> 01:07:32.910
Robbie!

01:07:33.014 --> 01:07:34.774
- Robbie, where are you?
- Where is he?

01:07:34.878 --> 01:07:37.777
Bernie?
I can't see!

01:07:37.881 --> 01:07:39.469
Darla? Darla?!

01:07:39.572 --> 01:07:41.471
Where'd you go?!

01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:46.510
- Ah!
Robbie!

01:07:46.614 --> 01:07:47.546
Darla?

01:07:49.755 --> 01:07:50.859
Robbie?!

01:07:50.963 --> 01:07:53.103
Hey! Darla?

01:07:53.207 --> 01:07:55.519
Careful, Darla!
Darla, watch out!

01:07:55.623 --> 01:07:57.142
Darla! Darla!

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:01.042
Darla! Babe! Babe!

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:06.082
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

01:08:07.704 --> 01:08:10.016
Oh, no!

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.811
No! Get off me!

01:08:11.915 --> 01:08:13.710
Robbie?!

01:08:13.813 --> 01:08:15.194
Robbie, run!

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:31.866
Shit.

01:08:39.943 --> 01:08:42.083
<i>♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪</i>

01:08:42.187 --> 01:08:44.706
<i>♪ Let's all go to the lobby</i>

01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:47.468
Get to the lobby!

01:09:29.993 --> 01:09:31.753
You did it.

01:09:33.755 --> 01:09:35.619
You did it.

01:09:44.835 --> 01:09:46.734
This is the spot.

01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:51.946
Let's hope this works.

01:09:53.948 --> 01:09:57.572
Can I just say, um...

01:09:57.676 --> 01:10:00.610
you like me?

01:10:00.713 --> 01:10:02.577
Right?

01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:04.441
Oh, Weirdo.

01:10:04.545 --> 01:10:06.823
Of course I like you.

01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:13.761
This Christmas
was gonna be my last.

01:10:13.864 --> 01:10:17.247
What?
You heard me.

01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:20.871
This was gonna be it.

01:10:20.975 --> 01:10:22.804
But you...

01:10:25.876 --> 01:10:28.224
...you helped me realize.

01:10:30.122 --> 01:10:32.987
You matter, Bernie.

01:10:36.542 --> 01:10:38.337
Yeah.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.273
I wasn't Clarence.

01:10:45.862 --> 01:10:48.036
You were.

01:11:02.016 --> 01:11:04.639
I hate to see you go.

01:11:06.192 --> 01:11:09.161
But reset it.
I'll be fine.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.370
I promise.

01:11:21.173 --> 01:11:23.831
I want my life back.

01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:30.941
I want my life back.

01:11:34.945 --> 01:11:37.085
I want to go home.

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:38.984
Let me go back!

01:11:40.779 --> 01:11:44.817
He killed my goddamn mom,
my aunt!

01:11:44.921 --> 01:11:48.304
Do I need to suffer any longer?!
Huh?!

01:11:48.407 --> 01:11:49.546
Winnie, we can
figure this out-

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:51.272
Give me my life back,
you hack!

01:12:01.075 --> 01:12:05.079
Bernie, what do I do?

01:12:11.188 --> 01:12:14.916
People of Angel Falls!
Are you on my naughty list?

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.747
Oh, crap.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:21.302
I think the aurora heard you.
It looks angry.

01:12:21.406 --> 01:12:23.477
We need to kill Waters.

01:12:25.513 --> 01:12:27.170
The Holcombs!

01:12:27.273 --> 01:12:30.104
The Holcombs have been nice,
of course.

01:12:30.207 --> 01:12:31.519
There they are.

01:12:31.623 --> 01:12:33.107
What a lucky couple.

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:36.213
Year after year, always nice,
and we appreciate that.

01:12:36.317 --> 01:12:39.458
Well, thank you.
Merry Christmas.

01:12:42.185 --> 01:12:43.807
Buck Waters!

01:12:43.911 --> 01:12:45.361
Huh?

01:12:45.464 --> 01:12:48.156
You've been naughty.

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.573
Uh-oh.
No, no.

01:12:50.676 --> 01:12:53.610
Come to me,
little brother. Come.

01:12:53.714 --> 01:12:55.060
Don't we love Buck?

01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:57.683
He's been such a great
sheriff for our town.

01:12:57.787 --> 01:12:59.927
We love Buck, don't we?

01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:04.690
But, my little brother,
you've been naughty.

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:07.728
I know.

01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:11.870
I found out last week
that Sheriff Buck here

01:13:11.973 --> 01:13:14.079
put in for a transfer.

01:13:14.182 --> 01:13:16.495
Yeah, he did.

01:13:16.599 --> 01:13:19.325
Now, why would
you do that?

01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:21.535
Get out of here!

01:13:27.886 --> 01:13:29.957
I don't want to do
this anymore, Henry.

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.510
It's okay. It's okay.

01:13:31.614 --> 01:13:35.480
You don't have to.
You don't have to.

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:36.826
I forgive you.

01:13:36.929 --> 01:13:39.242
Winnie, they're all just watching.

01:13:39.345 --> 01:13:42.038
We made it worse.

01:13:42.141 --> 01:13:44.592
I forgive you.

01:13:44.696 --> 01:13:46.456
Ah!

01:13:48.976 --> 01:13:50.598
This!

01:13:50.702 --> 01:13:53.843
I do this all for you!

01:13:53.946 --> 01:13:59.504
Only Henry Waters can give you
everything you need!

01:13:59.607 --> 01:14:00.850
He's an angel!

01:14:00.953 --> 01:14:04.060
- He's your angel.
- Someone do something.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.753
Oh, that's beautiful.
Our angel.

01:14:09.617 --> 01:14:11.343
Get out of here!

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.241
All of you!

01:14:16.037 --> 01:14:17.660
Well, now...

01:14:17.763 --> 01:14:20.007
what do we have here?

01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:23.148
An outsider and a pariah.

01:14:25.115 --> 01:14:26.841
Hi there, Weirdo.

01:14:26.945 --> 01:14:28.740
How's your mom?

01:14:30.983 --> 01:14:33.676
Your dad caught her
with Henry Waters.

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:42.685
You ruined her life.

01:14:42.788 --> 01:14:44.307
Oh!

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:45.515
Life?

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:50.313
What life?

01:14:50.416 --> 01:14:51.763
Bring them up.
I want to talk to them.

01:14:51.866 --> 01:14:52.867
Come on.

01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:54.973
Get 'em up here.
Let's have some fun.

01:14:55.076 --> 01:14:57.665
Ruined her life?

01:14:57.769 --> 01:14:59.391
It's a little annoying
'cause David was supposed

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:00.772
to take care of you.

01:15:00.875 --> 01:15:02.532
It's another one
for the naughty list, dear.

01:15:04.154 --> 01:15:07.295
So, David was just like
the rest of these people?

01:15:07.399 --> 01:15:09.228
More of your drones?

01:15:09.332 --> 01:15:10.782
Drones?

01:15:10.885 --> 01:15:12.749
Well, that's an ugly thing
to say in front

01:15:12.853 --> 01:15:15.580
of all these fine people.

01:15:15.683 --> 01:15:18.548
David needs me.
Like they do.

01:15:18.652 --> 01:15:21.344
The night I broke him,
when I took his only son,

01:15:21.447 --> 01:15:23.484
he saw my true power.

01:15:23.588 --> 01:15:26.867
And he came to his senses,
and so will you.

01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:29.145
Very soon.

01:15:29.248 --> 01:15:31.975
Well, I guess there's something
you should know.

01:15:32.079 --> 01:15:33.736
What's that?

01:15:33.839 --> 01:15:36.255
We fucking killed him.

01:15:40.052 --> 01:15:43.469
Did you really?

01:15:43.573 --> 01:15:45.299
That's a shame.

01:15:46.887 --> 01:15:49.199
This outsider's dangerous.

01:15:49.303 --> 01:15:53.687
And she allies herself
with our town's most pathetic.

01:15:55.412 --> 01:15:57.725
You don't know Angel Falls.

01:15:57.829 --> 01:15:59.451
What do you think?

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:00.763
You think you're
gonna come up here

01:16:00.866 --> 01:16:02.627
and liberate these people?

01:16:02.730 --> 01:16:04.905
They desire to be ruled.

01:16:05.008 --> 01:16:07.045
They need me.

01:16:12.637 --> 01:16:15.260
The people in this town care
about each other.

01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:16.572
Oh.

01:16:16.675 --> 01:16:19.333
And they know
they don't need you.

01:16:20.852 --> 01:16:23.475
You have no idea
what you are--

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.684
Ah!

01:16:25.788 --> 01:16:28.204
I've always
fucking hated you!

01:16:29.377 --> 01:16:30.724
Get your
fuckin' hands off me.

01:16:30.827 --> 01:16:32.967
This is cashmere.
Get off me.

01:16:33.071 --> 01:16:35.142
Don't embarrass
me, okay?

01:16:35.245 --> 01:16:38.076
I can handle this.

01:16:38.179 --> 01:16:40.975
Ooh.

01:16:41.079 --> 01:16:43.426
Ooh, you like
it rough, huh?

01:16:43.529 --> 01:16:44.496
Just like your mom--

01:16:53.954 --> 01:16:56.335
You fuckin' bitches.

01:16:56.439 --> 01:16:58.130
Hey, what the fuck?
Hey!

01:16:58.234 --> 01:16:59.684
Hey, get away from me!

01:17:05.793 --> 01:17:08.762
Back up, piss heads!
I'll use it!

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.766
Ah!

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.702
You dumb little sluts.

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:20.049
You just made
my naughty list!

01:17:24.294 --> 01:17:26.262
And you made ours.

01:18:01.746 --> 01:18:04.196
I was here to help you.

01:18:34.399 --> 01:18:35.641
My room!

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:38.783
I made it.

01:18:43.063 --> 01:18:46.791
Christmas!

01:18:49.448 --> 01:18:51.830
We should give this to her
as soon as she wakes.

01:18:51.934 --> 01:18:53.383
We owe that to her.

01:18:53.487 --> 01:18:55.523
Mom!

01:18:56.973 --> 01:18:59.665
- Whoa.
- What is this for?

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:02.427
Christmas.

01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:04.118
It's Christmas day, right?

01:19:04.222 --> 01:19:05.499
Of course.

01:19:05.602 --> 01:19:07.190
Honey, you're being silly.

01:19:07.294 --> 01:19:09.710
Yeah, it better be.
We got you a present.

01:19:09.814 --> 01:19:11.747
You got to
open it now, though.

01:19:13.818 --> 01:19:16.821
We thought you could use
a new camera.

01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:18.443
I love you.

01:19:18.546 --> 01:19:21.273
- Aw, honey.
- Love you.

01:19:21.377 --> 01:19:23.310
Good morning.

01:19:26.002 --> 01:19:29.005
Merry Christmas
to you, too!

01:19:29.109 --> 01:19:31.490
Someone's got
the hangover emotions.

01:19:31.594 --> 01:19:32.768
The hangover?

01:19:32.871 --> 01:19:34.390
You get one of those nights
a year.

01:19:34.493 --> 01:19:36.564
Do you hear me?
You're too young to drink.

01:19:36.668 --> 01:19:40.154
- I got drunk?
- Oh, so drunk, kid.

01:19:40.258 --> 01:19:42.916
Aunt Gale, Karen.
You're okay.

01:19:43.019 --> 01:19:45.470
Of course
we're okay.

01:19:49.612 --> 01:19:51.269
Whew.

01:19:51.372 --> 01:19:53.443
What a long night.

01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:57.275
I didn't get into NYU, Mom.

01:19:57.378 --> 01:19:58.863
Oh, honey.

01:19:58.966 --> 01:20:01.658
It's a relief. It would have
cost us a lot of money.

01:20:01.762 --> 01:20:02.659
It's okay.

01:20:02.763 --> 01:20:04.040
It's fine.

01:20:04.144 --> 01:20:05.904
Really.

01:20:06.008 --> 01:20:08.596
I love it here.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.046
I belong here.

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:12.600
I'm sorry we didn't
let you heal.

01:20:12.704 --> 01:20:14.740
We're here for you, sweetheart.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:16.466
No more
ignoring anything.

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:19.090
We're both
so proud of you.

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:24.267
Aunties, too!
Aunties, too!

01:20:24.578 --> 01:20:26.856
- Okay...
- You guys.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.272
Alright, fam.
Let's tear these presents open.

01:20:29.376 --> 01:20:33.552
- Come on, chop-chop.
- This is my favorite part!

Honey?

01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:50.915
Whoo!

01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:52.951

- You look great!
- Okay!

01:21:01.028 --> 01:21:02.858
No. It's okay.

01:21:02.961 --> 01:21:05.688
I'm okay.
You two are cute together.

01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:06.931
You fit.

01:21:07.034 --> 01:21:09.243
It's better this way.

01:21:09.347 --> 01:21:11.659
Okay.
Whoo!

01:21:11.763 --> 01:21:13.903
Thanks, Win!

01:21:14.007 --> 01:21:16.319
I know.
It's fine.

01:21:22.049 --> 01:21:24.051
Open the door, Bernie!

01:21:28.331 --> 01:21:29.781
What are you
doing here?

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.024
Bernie, no.

01:21:31.127 --> 01:21:32.542
I know that
it's hard right now,

01:21:32.646 --> 01:21:35.511
but I'm your friend,
and I can't let you do this.

01:21:35.614 --> 01:21:38.272
You matter, Bernie.

01:21:39.722 --> 01:21:41.482
You!

01:21:41.586 --> 01:21:43.519
I remember!

01:21:43.622 --> 01:21:45.452
I'm so glad you remember.

01:21:47.799 --> 01:21:49.732
Hi.
Hi.

01:21:49.835 --> 01:21:51.044
Okay, get dressed.

01:21:51.147 --> 01:21:52.735
We're gonna go to my house
for breakfast.

01:21:52.838 --> 01:21:53.943
And then we're going
to the Clova

01:21:54.047 --> 01:21:55.772
for a Christmas
movie marathon!

01:21:55.876 --> 01:21:58.085
Okay.

01:21:58.189 --> 01:22:00.191
Get your shit together, Weirdo.
I don't have all day.

01:22:00.294 --> 01:22:02.572
Don't ever
call me Weirdo again.

01:22:02.676 --> 01:22:04.920
