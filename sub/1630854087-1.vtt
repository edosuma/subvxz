00:20.662 --> 00:23.053
<i>The Red Sox are taking on</i>
<i>the Yankees at Fenway Park.</i>

00:23.088 --> 00:24.395
Five stars.

01:01.236 --> 01:02.268
Hmm.

01:42.805 --> 01:44.310
Oh.

01:44.345 --> 01:45.905
<i>Boston police.</i>

01:45.940 --> 01:48.743
Hi, this is I. M. Fletcher
calling from 5 Union Park.

01:48.778 --> 01:51.911
-<i> Yeah, and?</i>
-There's a murdered
woman downstairs.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.012
<i>-There's a what woman?</i>
-Murdered.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.982
<i> Well, uh,</i>
<i>this is just</i>
<i>a general precinct line.</i>

01:57.017 --> 01:58.852
<i>If you're scheduling a meeting</i>
<i>or something like that.</i>

01:58.887 --> 02:00.656
Yeah, well,
this is just a courtesy call.

02:00.691 --> 02:03.758
<i> A courtesy call?</i>
<i>You got a murder, you call 911.</i>

02:03.793 --> 02:08.059
Well...
...the emergency part's
kind of over, you know?

02:08.094 --> 02:10.336
<i> Well, this isn't</i>
<i>the murder department.</i>

02:11.405 --> 02:14.604
Can you just tell homicide?
It's 5 Union Park.

02:14.639 --> 02:16.672
They like murders.
They'll be interested.

02:26.486 --> 02:28.178
Uh, whoops.

02:31.183 --> 02:33.150
-You Fletcher?
-Yes.

02:33.185 --> 02:35.152
I'm Sergeant Inspector Monroe.

02:35.187 --> 02:37.594
Inspector?
Like in Scotland Yard?

02:37.629 --> 02:39.926
-This is Griz.
-Hello, Mr. Fletcher.

02:39.961 --> 02:41.829
Please,
my mother calls me Mr. Fletcher.

02:41.864 --> 02:43.897
-You can call me Fletch.
-Did you have a piece of fruit?

02:44.900 --> 02:46.471
I had a pear. How did you know?

02:46.506 --> 02:48.704
There's obviously
a piece missing.

02:48.739 --> 02:50.541
Griz, check the front door.

02:50.576 --> 02:51.971
Okay.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.611
-What's your full name?
-I. M. Fletcher.

02:54.646 --> 02:56.547
Hmm. I am Monroe.

02:57.583 --> 02:58.912
Full name, please.

03:00.487 --> 03:03.290
Irwin Maurice Fletcher.

03:11.729 --> 03:13.399
They caught me
in the middle of a yawn.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.093
They wouldn't let me retake it.
Can you imagine that?

03:16.162 --> 03:17.469
What'd you hit her with?

03:17.504 --> 03:18.998
I didn't hit her with anything.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.538
This your place?

03:20.573 --> 03:22.375
Well, I'm renting it
for a couple of weeks.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.707
-It's owned by a guy
named Owen Tasserly.

03:24.742 --> 03:27.281
Rather opulent
for just one person.

03:27.316 --> 03:31.043
Well, before you get the idea
that I'm some rich asshole,
I'm not.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.782
My girlfriend has the money.
She arranged this.

03:33.817 --> 03:35.586
Where is she?
Rome.

03:35.621 --> 03:37.390
Where I just flew back in from.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.051
Um,
I checked the front entrance.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.251
There's a key deadlock
and there's a sliding bolt

03:41.286 --> 03:43.726
and no footprints
and no forced entry.

03:43.761 --> 03:45.728
Nice job, Griz. Take five.

03:45.763 --> 03:47.059
What's your girlfriend's name?

03:47.094 --> 03:49.028
Andy. Angela.

03:49.063 --> 03:52.097
Andy Angela.
Write that down, Griz.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.605
It's Angela de Grassi.
You kill her too?

03:54.640 --> 03:57.234
May I remind you
that I reported this murder

03:57.269 --> 03:59.104
and waited
for you all to arrive?

03:59.139 --> 04:00.578
You been drinking long?
Oh, geez,

04:00.613 --> 04:02.349
I had my first beer
when I was 12.

04:03.550 --> 04:04.714
Mmm.

04:05.783 --> 04:07.277
Here you go, Griz.

04:07.312 --> 04:09.422
I'm not your waitress.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.952
No, I understand that,
but I thought maybe
you'd like my fingerprints.

04:11.987 --> 04:14.922
-See? Cooperating.
-Mmm.

04:14.957 --> 04:17.562
Hey, um, guy--
Sorry, I don't know your name.
Evidence?

04:20.028 --> 04:21.192
Do you need a blanket?

04:21.227 --> 04:22.732
You know what, Griz?

04:22.767 --> 04:24.668
Why don't you ask
Mr. Fletcher some questions.

04:24.703 --> 04:27.165
You're gonna have
the trainee interrogate me?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.738
Go ahead, Griz.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.641
Go ahead, Griz.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.314
Okay. Um...

04:36.847 --> 04:39.650
Um...
...Mr. Fletcher,

04:39.685 --> 04:42.279
did you know the victim,
Laurel Goodwin?

04:42.314 --> 04:44.985
Mm-mmm.
We never offer up
the victim's name.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.460
It's Griz's turn.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.891
Never met her. At least
not while she was alive.

04:49.926 --> 04:51.596
What flight were you on?
Alitalia.

04:51.631 --> 04:53.697
I landed at- 46 p.m.

04:53.732 --> 04:55.963
But you didn't call
the police until- 09.

04:55.998 --> 04:58.999
Well, I stopped and had dinner
at the Warren Tavern
on the way in.

04:59.034 --> 05:01.639
Can you produce proof of that?
A receipt, perhaps?

05:01.674 --> 05:03.674
-I paid cash.

05:03.709 --> 05:05.676
What do you do for a living?
-I'm a freelance journalist.

05:05.711 --> 05:08.305
I've spent the last two years
traveling Europe
writing about art.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.648
Quite the art collection
Mr. Tasserly has.

05:10.683 --> 05:11.847
Yeah.

05:11.882 --> 05:13.651
Paul Klee out there.
A Degas horse.

05:13.686 --> 05:15.620
I saw a Warhol over there
by the fish tank.

05:15.655 --> 05:17.083
See, this is my theory.

05:17.118 --> 05:20.350
I think the victim
interrupted an art theft.

05:20.385 --> 05:23.397
The thief got spooked,
bonked her over the head
and then ran.

05:23.432 --> 05:25.223
No amateur sleuthing,
please.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.864
Listen, I used to be
a investigative reporter
of some repute.

05:28.899 --> 05:30.668
I could be very helpful
in this whole matter.

05:30.703 --> 05:32.263
I used to play the trumpet
in high school.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.507
I never offered advice
to Miles Davis.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.168
Shut up and talk.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.203
That's a very confusing
combination of commands.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.513
Mr. Fletcher,
why are you in Boston?

05:40.548 --> 05:44.517
I'm researching a book.
The definitive biography
of Edgar Arthur Tharp Jr.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.376
The cowboy painter.

05:46.411 --> 05:48.686
-You've heard of him.
-I prefer Remington.

05:48.721 --> 05:50.556
You would.

05:50.591 --> 05:52.888
Go on, Griz.
Okay. Where was I?

05:52.923 --> 05:57.387
Sorry, I'm so distracted
by Mr. Fletcher's feet.

05:57.422 --> 05:59.730
Come on, Griz.
Feet want to be free.

05:59.765 --> 06:01.864
I see you two
have been brainwashed
by the shoe lobby.

06:01.899 --> 06:04.328
My Go--
Okay, look, Mr. Fletcher.

06:04.363 --> 06:08.134
If you did kill
this young woman, a confession
would be appreciated.

06:08.169 --> 06:11.170
I have a baby at the house.
Do you have a baby
at your house?

06:11.205 --> 06:13.403
I really could use some sleep.

06:13.438 --> 06:16.516
Okay, Inspector,
you know there's such a thing
as paternity leave, right?

06:18.179 --> 06:20.949
So, you're a journalist,
traipsing all over Europe?

06:20.984 --> 06:23.589
-You really make a living
doing that?
-Yeah, I make a decent one.

06:23.624 --> 06:29.892
No secondary forms of income
from more unsavory lines
of work?

06:29.927 --> 06:33.027
Writing for in-flight magazines
is about as unsavory as it gets.

06:33.062 --> 06:36.866
You got some place you can stay?
We're gonna need 24 hours
to do a full sweep.

06:36.901 --> 06:38.571
I don't know. Right here's okay.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.971
Are you sure there's nothing
you're hiding from me,
Mr. Fletcher?

06:44.876 --> 06:47.976
Come on, Inspector.
I'm an open book.

08:25.746 --> 08:27.581
Mr. Fletcher?
Yes.

08:28.650 --> 08:30.650
Thank you for meeting me,
Miss de Grassi.

08:31.686 --> 08:33.477
Would you like something, sir?

08:33.512 --> 08:34.687
Uh, are you paying?

08:35.547 --> 08:36.920
A negroni, please.

08:36.955 --> 08:39.659
-Madame, another one?
-No, thank you.

08:39.694 --> 08:42.189
So, how is
the Count Clementi
Arbogastes de Grassi?

08:43.027 --> 08:45.060
My father is fine.

08:45.095 --> 08:49.196
But I don't understand
why he hired you to find
his stolen paintings.

08:49.231 --> 08:51.737
Who are you?
I'm a freelance journalist.

08:51.772 --> 08:55.499
Uh, your father liked a piece
I wrote about an art theft
at the Royal Museum in Brussels.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.743
My story helped the police
crack the case.

08:57.778 --> 08:59.910
Good for you,
but you're not a detective.

08:59.945 --> 09:02.682
No, but I was
an investigative reporter
of some repute.

09:02.717 --> 09:05.047
I don't do much
of that anymore.
Why?

09:05.082 --> 09:09.986
It's an occupation that's been
cheapened by the digital age,
like president.

09:10.021 --> 09:13.418
Well, I wasn't
at my father's villa
when the paintings were stolen,

09:13.453 --> 09:15.860
so I don't have
any new information.

09:15.895 --> 09:17.158
Well, that's okay. I do.

09:19.129 --> 09:22.328
You do? Tell me.

09:22.363 --> 09:24.869
There's an art dealer
in Boston named Ronald Horan.

09:24.904 --> 09:27.234
He's already sold
two of your father's
Renaissance paintings.

09:27.269 --> 09:31.106
-The Bellini and the Perugino.
-Are you serious?
H-How would he have them?

09:31.141 --> 09:32.745
Well, I have no idea.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.681
He might not even know
that they were stolen.

09:34.716 --> 09:37.277
Do you think he has
the other paintings?
All nine were taken.

09:37.312 --> 09:38.784
He very well might.

09:38.819 --> 09:42.051
The Picasso was appraised
at 20 million dollars.

09:42.086 --> 09:45.285
Well, that hardly
seems worth stealing.
<i>Grazia.</i>

09:45.320 --> 09:47.419
Excuse me, I changed my mind.
I'll have another.

09:50.358 --> 09:52.457
So,
what are you going to do now?

09:52.492 --> 09:54.624
Well, I'd thought I'd visit
Mr. Horan in Boston

09:54.659 --> 09:57.528
and see if he had any ties
to Rome or the black market
in the art world.

09:57.563 --> 10:00.168
How can I help,
Mr. Fletcher?

10:00.203 --> 10:02.071
You don't need to be so formal.

10:02.975 --> 10:04.304
What should I call you?

10:06.440 --> 10:08.044
All of my friends call me...

10:08.079 --> 10:09.573
Fletch!

10:20.124 --> 10:24.797
I want to swim in your eyes.

10:25.657 --> 10:27.668
Like a...

10:28.165 --> 10:30.968
...piss.

10:32.939 --> 10:34.334
Like a piss?

10:35.502 --> 10:38.140
No, like a<i> pisciata,</i>
like a pool.

10:40.947 --> 10:43.442
My Italian is very good.

10:43.477 --> 10:48.689
-No. No. No.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.257
So what do you know
about this Ronald Horan?

10:56.292 --> 11:00.459
On his Facebook page,
I found out he teaches
an art history class at Harvard.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.296
He's a member
of the Mayflower Yacht Club

11:02.331 --> 11:06.333
and he's really into EDM,
electronic dance music.

11:07.402 --> 11:09.435
Had his gallery broken into
in 2015.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.911
They stole
some Impressionist paintings,
um...

11:12.946 --> 11:14.880
I really haven't found
anything incriminating.

11:14.915 --> 11:18.213
Sometimes I wonder
i-if my father's new wife,

11:18.248 --> 11:20.644
the Countess de Grassi,
as she loves to call herself,

11:20.679 --> 11:23.680
if somehow she's involved.

11:23.715 --> 11:28.091
I don't trust her, Fletch,
and I know she married papa
for his money.

11:28.126 --> 11:30.225
Well, Andy,
that's pretty cynical.

11:31.459 --> 11:33.261
Well, maybe she married him
for love...

11:33.901 --> 11:35.065
of money.

11:39.841 --> 11:41.665
<i>How did you end up in Europe?</i>

11:41.700 --> 11:43.469
<i>Was it because of a woman?</i>

11:43.504 --> 11:47.176
Two actually.
My ex-wives said
they needed space,

11:47.211 --> 11:49.508
so I figured
6,000 miles is about right.

11:49.543 --> 11:53.380
Wow, how is it
that you were married twice?

11:54.284 --> 11:57.318
I am very easy
to fall in love with.

11:57.353 --> 12:01.751
I'm very good
at falling in love.
Not so good at choosing.

12:01.786 --> 12:05.799
How so?
Well, I've fallen in love
with married men,

12:05.834 --> 12:09.297
pathological liars,
two drug dealers

12:10.003 --> 12:12.399
and a pyromaniac.

12:12.434 --> 12:14.973
Well, now, see,
I'm only one or two
of those things.

12:19.540 --> 12:21.881
Your famine
creates traffic jams.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.542
Please, no more Italian.

12:24.743 --> 12:27.018
-Ignore it.
-Mm-hmm.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.683
Okay.

12:38.295 --> 12:41.967
We need to speak
to Madam Angela de Grassi.

12:42.002 --> 12:43.430
Has something happened
to my father?

12:43.465 --> 12:45.069
I'm afraid so.

12:45.104 --> 12:46.697
He has been kidnapped.

12:46.732 --> 12:49.568
All we know is that
it was three men with guns.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.912
They put your father into a car
and drove off.

12:52.947 --> 12:55.079
They put the priest
in the machine?

12:55.114 --> 12:57.576
Did they hurt him?
We don't think so.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.282
You don't
have to speak in English.

13:00.317 --> 13:02.119
My Italian is very good.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.386
We've kept it quiet so far.

13:05.421 --> 13:07.058
Was the Countess de Grassi
there?

13:07.093 --> 13:09.819
No, she's visiting her brother
in Milan.

13:09.854 --> 13:11.491
The kidnappers have already
named a ransom.

13:11.526 --> 13:13.130
I'll pay them
whatever they want.

13:13.165 --> 13:15.132
They don't want money.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.695
They want a painting
your father owns.

13:19.633 --> 13:20.698
A Picasso.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.207
That's very Italian.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.983
<i> Fletch, I can't sleep.</i>

13:31.018 --> 13:33.348
<i>-I miss you.</i>
-I miss you too.
I wish you were here.

13:33.383 --> 13:35.152
Do I hear people talking?

13:35.187 --> 13:37.319
<i> Uh, listen, Andy,</i>
<i>I need you to contact that site</i>

13:37.354 --> 13:39.618
<i>where you found</i>
<i>Tasserly's townhouse.</i>

13:39.653 --> 13:41.752
Is there
something wrong with it?
Well, kinda.

13:41.787 --> 13:45.195
Uh,
I found a dead woman downstairs.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.935
What?<i> Oddio santo!</i>

13:48.970 --> 13:51.905
Who-Who-Who was she?
Who killed her?

13:51.940 --> 13:54.171
Apparently,
her name is Laurel Goodwin.

13:54.206 --> 13:57.009
I have no idea who killed her,
but there is a detective here

13:57.044 --> 14:00.012
who seems very keen on the idea
of it being me.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.409
How could he think that?

14:01.444 --> 14:02.740
<i> I'm looking into it.</i>

14:02.775 --> 14:05.116
Please don't get involved, okay?

14:05.151 --> 14:08.152
<i> We have to focus</i>
<i>on finding out</i>
<i>if Horan has the Picasso.</i>

14:08.187 --> 14:09.516
<i>Okay?</i>
<i>We have to save my father.</i>

14:09.551 --> 14:11.023
No, we will. We will.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.992
Did you get the line of credit
set up at Lloyds?

14:13.027 --> 14:14.686
<i>Of course I did.</i>

14:14.721 --> 14:16.688
Fletch, the Countess is
going around Rome

14:16.723 --> 14:18.789
telling anyone who will listen

14:18.824 --> 14:22.199
that my father's
left her everything,
as if he's already dead.

14:22.234 --> 14:24.135
<i> Andy,</i>
<i>why don't you just come here?</i>

14:24.170 --> 14:28.040
That way, we can be together
while I sort out
this Horan situation

14:28.075 --> 14:30.108
and all this other stuff.

14:30.143 --> 14:34.178
I want to be with you, Fletch,
but not with my father
still missing.

14:34.213 --> 14:36.741
<i>And now this horrible thing</i>
<i>has happened to you.</i>

14:36.776 --> 14:39.920
Yeah, I think the horrible thing
happened to Laurel Goodwin.

14:44.916 --> 14:47.488
-Yeah, is this Julio?

14:47.523 --> 14:52.064
Hi, it's Mr. Fletcher.
I was calling about the used van
you had listed on Only Vans.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.561
Morris.
Oh, that's great, yeah.

14:54.596 --> 14:57.927
I will--
I'll see you this afternoon.
Excellent. Thanks.

15:04.012 --> 15:05.077
You sleep.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.491
You know what?
Right here's fine.

15:23.526 --> 15:25.757
What? I can't stop here.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.034
Understood.
Maybe you have something
up there I can vomit into?

15:34.504 --> 15:35.833
-Five stars.
-Bye.

15:49.057 --> 15:50.122
Oh, my...

15:52.324 --> 15:53.521
Where the fuck are we?

15:54.227 --> 15:55.292
Um...

15:57.197 --> 15:58.229
Five stars.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.603
<i> Hello?</i>
Ralph Locke for Mr.--

16:18.977 --> 16:21.285
In here.

16:24.048 --> 16:25.784
Mr. Horan.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.523
Well, wonderful
to finally meet you, Mr. Locke.

16:28.558 --> 16:29.920
Please, call me Ralph.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.955
Ah, I'm sorry,
I don't shake hands.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.396
Uh, since the pandemic?

16:33.431 --> 16:34.958
Since touch screens.

16:34.993 --> 16:37.730
Haven't had a cold in 20 years.
Please.

16:37.765 --> 16:39.270
There you have it.
Mm-hmm.

16:39.305 --> 16:40.898
Some interesting music
you were listening to.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.539
Yes, it gets the blood pumping
and the pulse pounding.

16:44.574 --> 16:46.673
I guess that's why
it sounds like a heart monitor.

16:46.708 --> 16:49.643
I apologize, Ralph,
I'm a little pressed for time.

16:49.678 --> 16:51.348
I teach
a summer school class
at Harvard.

16:51.383 --> 16:52.778
Oh, please, no worries.

16:58.423 --> 17:01.259
<i> Portrait of a Woman</i>
<i>With an Ermine Collar.</i>

17:01.294 --> 17:04.262
In this case,
Picasso's wife, Olga.

17:04.297 --> 17:06.627
He made several portraits
of Olga,

17:06.662 --> 17:10.862
but when you emailed me
about this one, I didn't
really believe it existed.

17:11.832 --> 17:14.734
But it does.
And I found the owner.

17:14.769 --> 17:16.208
Is he willing to sell?

17:16.243 --> 17:18.573
Uh, he's willing
to entertain an offer.

17:18.608 --> 17:21.378
What's his name?
Oh, he prefers
to remain anonymous,

17:21.413 --> 17:23.413
but he lives in New York City

17:23.448 --> 17:26.548
and I think I can get
the Picasso here by Saturday,
maybe even Friday.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.044
Well, that is terrific.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.586
There is also the question
of credit, Mr. Locke.

17:31.621 --> 17:33.951
Most of the people I deal with
I've known for years.

17:33.986 --> 17:38.021
Lloyds Bank of Canary Islands
should be able to establish
whatever credit you require.

17:38.056 --> 17:41.266
It's like I've known you
for years.

17:41.301 --> 17:45.798
Here is a simple boilerplate
contract for my services.

17:45.833 --> 17:47.734
-'Kay.
-Oh, please.

17:56.074 --> 17:59.548
-Okay.
That one goes here.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.189
Of course.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.226
Quite the collection
of impressionists
you have here.

18:07.261 --> 18:12.396
Mmm.
Pre-, post-, neo-.
All the best prefixes.

18:12.431 --> 18:15.630
I was robbed a few years ago,
so I don't keep anything
of value in the building.

18:15.665 --> 18:17.962
Those are reproductions.
That's how I introduce
my children.

18:19.163 --> 18:21.339
Oh, do you sail?
I do not.

18:21.374 --> 18:23.737
I have an aversion
to boat shoes.
Well, shoes in general,

18:23.772 --> 18:26.608
but boat shoes in particular.
I mean, is it a slipper
or is it a shoe?

18:26.643 --> 18:28.313
Come on. Pick a lane.

18:29.415 --> 18:31.074
Is this a model of your boat?

18:31.109 --> 18:33.186
Well, yes,
I'm embarrassed to admit it is.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.255
Well, she's beautiful.
Thank you.

18:36.290 --> 18:38.257
I hope to see you soon,
Mr. Horan.
Indeed.

18:43.924 --> 18:49.499
-Always fondling my boat.

18:52.669 --> 18:54.471
All right. Well, here we go.

18:55.639 --> 18:58.442
$1200.
All right, cool.

18:58.477 --> 19:01.280
Just be mindful of the bees
in the back. You feel me?

19:02.316 --> 19:03.843
That honey's all yours, baby.

19:10.687 --> 19:12.654
Hi, Andy. Still miss me?

19:12.689 --> 19:16.856
Yes, my love, so much.
But you know what I found out?

19:16.891 --> 19:19.661
The Countess's brother,
he's been to prison.

19:19.696 --> 19:22.334
<i>He's a thief.</i>
<i>I bet you he stole</i>
<i>all the paintings for her.</i>

19:22.369 --> 19:24.897
You know, Andy,
I know you don't like
the Countess very much,

19:24.932 --> 19:26.635
but she was very charming
when I met her.

19:26.670 --> 19:28.032
Where are you?

19:28.067 --> 19:29.803
<i>I'm in a Ford Econoline van</i>

19:29.838 --> 19:32.135
that I'm about
to go get painted.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.643
Oh, Andy, Horan says
he could get the Picasso.

19:34.678 --> 19:37.877
Oh, Fletch.
You must get it.
It's my father's only hope.

19:37.912 --> 19:41.518
Well, I'm sure
the Italian police are working
around the clock on this case.

19:41.553 --> 19:44.686
-Or at least near a clock.
-Do you know
where the painting is?

19:44.721 --> 19:47.392
<i> Horan says</i>
<i>he doesn't keep any art</i>
<i>at his building,</i>

19:47.427 --> 19:50.120
so I'm gonna stake out his house
the next couple of nights.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.595
See if he goes anywhere
to get the Picasso.

19:52.630 --> 19:54.696
<i> You need to steal</i>
<i>that painting back, Fletch.</i>

19:54.731 --> 19:57.963
A-All of them, if you can.

19:57.998 --> 20:00.229
Maybe you should get a gun,
just in case.

20:00.264 --> 20:01.934
<i>You must know</i>
<i>a lot of criminals.</i>

20:01.969 --> 20:04.409
-Yeah. Andy,
I have to call you back.
<i>-What? Fletch!</i>

20:16.049 --> 20:17.290
Whatcha doing?

20:18.887 --> 20:20.689
Um...
Nothing.

20:20.724 --> 20:22.053
Where's your permit?

20:24.431 --> 20:28.730
Geez. Of course.
I knew it. Unreal.

20:28.765 --> 20:30.897
I'm gonna get out of here.
Unless I'm under arrest,

20:30.932 --> 20:33.306
in which case,
I'm listening very carefully
to your instructions,

20:33.341 --> 20:35.066
because we all know
how that shit goes.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.574
Oh, no, no, no.
Look, I may have
come across wrong here.

20:37.609 --> 20:39.235
I'm Mike Wahlberg. Mikey Mike.

20:39.270 --> 20:42.414
I'm with
the City League Arts Project,
the CLAP.

20:42.449 --> 20:43.877
-The Clap?
-I know.

20:43.912 --> 20:45.912
Trust me.
We're workshopping the name,

20:45.947 --> 20:50.081
but our mission is
to discover and celebrate
some of the young artists

20:50.116 --> 20:51.951
here on the streets of Boston.

20:51.986 --> 20:53.986
But who's gonna
see your work here?

20:54.923 --> 20:56.461
My aunt takes this way
to work, so...

20:56.496 --> 20:58.188
Right,
here's what I can do for you.

20:58.223 --> 21:01.125
See that van?
You can paint the whole van.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.898
-Then, when I drive it around,
people can see your creation.
-Sounds sketchy.

21:04.933 --> 21:06.834
Well, look,
I understand
you might not want to trust

21:06.869 --> 21:09.001
a white guy driving
in an unmarked van

21:09.036 --> 21:12.202
who likes to have
conversations with young people,
but I tell you what.

21:12.237 --> 21:15.480
I can give you $300 cash.

21:15.515 --> 21:17.878
You're not making this sound
any less sketchy, bro.

21:17.913 --> 21:19.649
It's for supplies and labor.

21:19.684 --> 21:20.947
You trust us?

21:20.982 --> 21:23.312
You're artists, right?

21:23.347 --> 21:27.756
If you don't use that van
as your mobile canvas,
you're just cheating yourself.

21:30.398 --> 21:32.992
I don't know what all that
white man nonsense was,
but you got a deal.

21:33.027 --> 21:35.665
Fantastic.
All right, I will be back here,
right here.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.634
Two days. The whole van painted.

21:37.669 --> 21:40.703
Make sure you sign it,
so the world knows who did it.

21:40.738 --> 21:43.442
Okay. What was your name again?

21:43.477 --> 21:45.807
What did I say?
You're asking us
what your name is?

21:45.842 --> 21:47.303
Be inspired.

21:51.848 --> 21:53.518
Five stars, my friend.

22:18.743 --> 22:19.775
Hey!

22:22.142 --> 22:25.682
Oh, fuck! Fuck me.

22:25.717 --> 22:27.717
Oh, sorry. Oh my-- Oh!

22:27.752 --> 22:31.182
It's not cracked.
Good for you.

22:31.217 --> 22:35.351
-I just got it fixed. Hi.
-Hi.

22:35.386 --> 22:37.221
Are you the guy
staying in Owen's townhouse?

22:37.256 --> 22:39.696
Yes, uh, Fletch.

22:39.731 --> 22:40.862
Eve.

22:40.897 --> 22:42.259
Hello, Eve.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.832
Did you murder that girl?
No, I didn't.

22:43.867 --> 22:44.866
Did you?
No.

22:44.901 --> 22:47.737
Did Owen?
Who knows?

22:47.772 --> 22:49.871
He has a lot of ladies up there,
but they usually leave alive.

22:49.906 --> 22:52.368
So what else can you tell me
about Owen?

22:52.403 --> 22:54.271
Oh, you want to know more
about Owen?

22:54.911 --> 22:56.042
-Sure.

22:56.077 --> 23:00.211
Do you, uh...
...smoke?

23:00.246 --> 23:02.818
-Every now and again, sure.
-Okay, well,
you should come over.

23:02.853 --> 23:06.052
-I live right next door.
-Eve, I am under suspicion
of committing murder.

23:06.087 --> 23:08.527
-How do you know
I'm not just gonna strangle you?

23:08.562 --> 23:11.057
Fletch, you're so naughty.

23:11.092 --> 23:14.863
Okay, let's go,
Mr. Boston Strangler.

23:14.898 --> 23:17.668
My contacts are in
the wrong eyes.

23:17.703 --> 23:18.735
Here we go.

23:19.936 --> 23:22.871
-Okay, we are home.

23:22.906 --> 23:25.808
Oh, the power's back on.

23:25.843 --> 23:29.273
I guess my check didn't bounce.
That's good.

23:29.308 --> 23:32.650
Mignon, are you ready?
It's time for dinner.
We have a guest.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.719
Glad I tidied up earlier.

23:37.052 --> 23:38.953
I hope you like music, Fletch.
Mmm.

23:41.793 --> 23:43.694
Did you want your keys?

23:43.729 --> 23:46.730
I'm starving.
I'm gonna heat something up.

23:46.765 --> 23:49.095
Are you hungry?
Oh, no, I ate yesterday.

23:49.999 --> 23:51.295
Matzo ball soup.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.099
So what's Owen's story?

23:53.134 --> 23:55.299
What's he do for a living?

23:55.334 --> 23:58.434
He's from a very wealthy family,
so he doesn't really have a job,

23:58.469 --> 24:01.272
but he's tried his hand
at a lot of different things.

24:07.082 --> 24:10.083
Um, yeah, for a while
he wanted to be an actor,

24:10.118 --> 24:12.250
but he didn't really know
how to act,

24:12.285 --> 24:17.090
so he started a restaurant
that went out of business
before it even opened.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.631
Then he invested in a hotel
that never opened,

24:19.666 --> 24:22.095
and now he's an art broker.

24:22.130 --> 24:23.701
You seem to know a lot
about Owen.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.395
-Yeah.

24:25.430 --> 24:26.605
Mignon!

24:26.640 --> 24:28.167
-Oh, geez.

24:28.202 --> 24:30.774
Wow. That is a lot
for a little dog.

24:30.809 --> 24:33.678
She pees when she's hungry.
I do the same thing.

24:33.713 --> 24:37.341
Owen goes to Europe a lot,
and I feed his fish
when he's gone.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.311
They're all named after artists.

24:41.281 --> 24:44.480
Picasso, Rothko, Frida Kahlo.

24:46.187 --> 24:48.792
Owen and I are friends.
I never want to say
anything bad about him,

24:48.827 --> 24:50.761
but he is very pretentious.

24:50.796 --> 24:52.422
Hmm.

24:52.457 --> 24:54.633
-Mignon, you want some chicken?

24:54.668 --> 24:56.129
-You want chicken?

24:56.164 --> 24:59.264
This townhouse
is broken up into condos

24:59.299 --> 25:00.606
and I've lived here the longest,

25:00.641 --> 25:02.300
before the rich people
moved in upstairs

25:02.335 --> 25:04.533
and started the "no pets" rule.

25:04.568 --> 25:08.042
They said I could keep Mignon,
but when she died,
I couldn't get another dog,

25:08.077 --> 25:13.652
but the joke's on them,
because this is my third Mignon.

25:13.687 --> 25:17.018
When one dies,
I just get another one
that looks exactly the same.

25:17.053 --> 25:19.383
And they think
I have a 25-year-old dog,

25:19.418 --> 25:23.255
because rich people
are so oblivious.

25:23.290 --> 25:24.960
Like,
I don't know what it is.

25:24.995 --> 25:27.358
People get a bunch of money
and-- Oops.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.328
-Your scarf was on fire.
-Oh, thank you.

25:30.363 --> 25:33.903
Yeah, I hung out with Owen
a lot this last year,

25:33.938 --> 25:35.839
when his wife left him.

25:35.874 --> 25:38.743
I kind of became
his quasi-shrink.
We talked a lot.

25:38.778 --> 25:41.306
He'd come down here.
We'd smoke. He'd cry.

25:42.507 --> 25:44.243
I've been through divorce.
Yeah.

25:44.278 --> 25:46.751
That's how
I got this apartment.
Oh.

25:46.786 --> 25:50.183
Well, it wasn't really divorce.

25:50.218 --> 25:53.483
He died on the toilet,
but nobody wants to hear
that story.

25:53.518 --> 25:54.792
No, we sure don't.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.190
But Owen is divorced?

25:57.225 --> 25:59.555
Um, not officially.
Whoa. Okay.

26:00.624 --> 26:04.098
His ex Tatiana,
she's making it complicated.

26:04.133 --> 26:06.166
I don't want to say
anything bad about Tatiana,

26:07.136 --> 26:10.500
but she's a detestable person.

26:10.535 --> 26:12.909
She calls herself
a lifestyle curator,
a thought leader.

26:12.944 --> 26:13.976
What is that?

26:15.111 --> 26:16.209
Not familiar with it.

26:16.244 --> 26:17.606
Owen financed her company,

26:17.641 --> 26:18.981
now she wants to cut him out

26:19.016 --> 26:20.752
and she wants full custody
of their child.

26:20.787 --> 26:23.018
Huh.
Owen is a good dad.

26:23.053 --> 26:25.152
Tatiana really,
really, really...

26:25.187 --> 26:26.890
Just-- Just be careful.

26:26.925 --> 26:28.122
...really sucks. Oh.

26:28.157 --> 26:29.519
Yeah, you got it.

26:29.554 --> 26:31.323
You got it right
in the thing there. Oops.

26:31.358 --> 26:33.391
I mean,
Tatiana is hot if you like
that sort of thing.

26:33.426 --> 26:34.799
That's-- That's gonna-- Ooh.

26:34.834 --> 26:36.702
But she is so mean to Owen.

26:36.737 --> 26:38.770
People are weird.
They like being treated
like shit--

26:38.805 --> 26:40.101
-Please, just-- Good Lord.
-Oh.

26:40.136 --> 26:42.301
-I really cut myself.
-Yeah, you did.

26:42.336 --> 26:44.402
Put some pressure on that.
The knife was so sharp,
I didn't even feel it.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.074
-Put-- Wrap it up.

26:46.109 --> 26:47.537
Anyway, that's Owen's story.

26:47.572 --> 26:48.879
And there's more stuff,

26:48.914 --> 26:50.408
but I don't wanna
betray his trust.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.915
Please, I totally understand.

26:51.950 --> 26:52.982
Drinking a lot.

26:53.853 --> 26:55.413
-Hard drugs.
-Ooh.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.613
I don't want to say which ones.

27:00.189 --> 27:04.356
It's like Percocet, Oxy, Molly.

27:05.524 --> 27:07.898
Drugs are no way
to deal with your problems.
No.

27:07.933 --> 27:09.801
It sounds like
you really care for Owen.

27:09.836 --> 27:13.739
What? That is personal.
Just a habit.
I ask a lot of questions.

27:13.774 --> 27:16.940
I used to be
an investigative reporter.
I am not in love with Owen.

27:18.504 --> 27:20.339
I never said you were.
You didn't?

27:20.374 --> 27:22.143
-No.
-Oh. Well, I...

27:22.178 --> 27:24.310
Okay. I thought maybe
that's what you said.

27:24.345 --> 27:26.477
Mignon,
get your foot out of this pan.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.281
Yeah, that's the pan.
That's the one.

27:29.548 --> 27:32.956
Really? You're gonna--
You're gonna eat that?
Yeah.

27:32.991 --> 27:35.156
Maybe not that piece.
Yeah, well, not this one.

27:35.191 --> 27:36.190
This one's bloody.
Mm-hmm.

27:36.830 --> 27:38.687
Yup.
Sorry.

27:38.722 --> 27:42.361
So Owen didn't kill that girl,
but they are gonna suspect him.

27:42.396 --> 27:44.429
Why are they gonna suspect him?

27:44.464 --> 27:46.464
Well, he got arrested
a few months ago.

27:46.499 --> 27:47.740
Oh, no.

27:47.775 --> 27:49.005
I probably
shouldn't tell you that.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.206
Well, what, uh-- What happened?

27:52.241 --> 27:54.637
Well, okay.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.474
Whoa. More fire. More fire.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.949
Oh, it'll burn off.

27:58.984 --> 28:03.019
Um, so there's this banker
that lives on the fourth floor,
he's kind of a dick.

28:03.054 --> 28:04.713
He and Owen
got in a little fight.

28:04.748 --> 28:07.386
Really?
And why was only Owen arrested?

28:07.421 --> 28:10.829
What is this?
Woodbird and Bernstein?

28:10.864 --> 28:12.721
Almost.
Owen is a good guy.

28:12.756 --> 28:14.426
I'm not in love with him.

28:14.461 --> 28:15.900
Matzo ball soup?

28:15.935 --> 28:17.770
You know what,
as much as I would love to eat,

28:17.805 --> 28:19.838
-I-- I really have to be going.
-Oh.

28:19.873 --> 28:24.403
But if you hear anything else
about the murder,
you let me know, okay?

28:24.438 --> 28:26.779
Sure, Fletch.
Okay.

28:26.814 --> 28:28.737
-Bye-bye, Mignon.

28:32.050 --> 28:35.755
God, again?
What is this? The battery?

28:36.681 --> 28:38.186
-Mignon, shush.

28:40.190 --> 28:41.255
I got it, Fletch.

28:42.456 --> 28:43.488
Mignon!

28:44.260 --> 28:46.029
See ya, Fletch.

28:46.064 --> 28:48.031
<i>PETA is not a big fan</i>
<i>of this idea.</i>

28:48.066 --> 28:50.561
<i>They balance</i>
<i>their body temperatures</i>
<i>through their skin.</i>

28:50.596 --> 28:52.761
<i>That's why pigs</i>
<i>like to roll around</i>
<i>in mud or puddles</i>

28:52.796 --> 28:54.103
<i>to cool off on warm days.</i>

28:54.138 --> 28:56.072
<i>They have very few sweat glands</i>

28:56.107 --> 28:58.305
<i>and they don't release</i>
<i>body heat</i>
<i>through sweating like we do.</i>

28:58.340 --> 29:00.604
<i> So, the saying</i>
<i>"sweating like a pig"</i>
<i>is, like, total bullshit?</i>

29:00.639 --> 29:04.014
<i> Well,</i>
<i>that phrase actually comes from</i>
<i>smelting of iron ore to...</i>

29:14.125 --> 29:15.157
Okay.

29:25.268 --> 29:27.136
Good evening, Inspector.

29:27.171 --> 29:29.666
What brings you to Back Bay,
Mr. Fletcher?

29:29.701 --> 29:32.471
You know,
I just love listening
to podcasts in my car.

29:33.408 --> 29:34.946
Particularly interesting one
on pigs.

29:34.981 --> 29:36.541
Did you know they don't sweat?

29:36.576 --> 29:39.445
And they have
the longest orgasms
of any mammal.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.513
Would you mind stepping
out of the car please,
Mr. Fletcher?

29:41.548 --> 29:44.648
Okay,
but I'll only stay
for two or three insults.

29:44.683 --> 29:45.781
Four, max.

29:47.257 --> 29:51.094
This is a nice car
for a broke asshole.
That's one.

29:51.129 --> 29:55.296
No one seems to remember you
from the Warren Tavern
last night.

29:55.331 --> 29:56.660
I don't remember
any of them either.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.101
Come back with me
to police headquarters.

29:58.136 --> 29:59.300
I still have
a few more questions.

29:59.335 --> 30:01.401
You know, I would love to, uh,

30:01.436 --> 30:04.074
but I'm meeting
the head of the Tharp Foundation
for dinner tonight.

30:04.109 --> 30:06.879
You can either come voluntarily
or I can arrest you.

30:07.838 --> 30:09.607
I get it.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.808
You want my help.
Okay. How'd you find me?

30:12.843 --> 30:14.810
We police
get to keep some secrets,
Mr. Fletch.

30:14.845 --> 30:17.153
And those civil liberties
are so pesky.

30:17.188 --> 30:18.616
Hi, Griz.
Hello.

30:18.651 --> 30:19.683
Did you miss me?

30:19.718 --> 30:20.783
No.

30:23.326 --> 30:25.029
Hey, guys,
is there a way we can
call in a coffee order?

30:25.064 --> 30:27.427
I'd kill for a macchiato.
Not literally.

30:37.901 --> 30:40.913
Nice job, Griz.
Four stars.
Your back seat's filthy.

30:42.015 --> 30:43.608
Anybody up there watching live?

30:44.985 --> 30:47.513
They gotta hear
about pig orgasms.
Pig what?

30:47.548 --> 30:49.779
Don't-- Don't--
Don't encourage him.

30:49.814 --> 30:52.089
You should Google it, Griz.
You would not be disappointed.

30:53.521 --> 30:56.522
So what do we know
about this victim?
Like we're gonna tell you.

30:56.557 --> 30:57.886
Laurel Goodwin's
from Worcester.

30:57.921 --> 30:59.888
Was living in Allston
with two roommates.

30:59.923 --> 31:02.594
Worked at a Cambridge Café
as a barista.

31:02.629 --> 31:04.299
W-We're telling you.

31:04.334 --> 31:08.941
Ms. Goodwin was pursuing
a career in the art world.

31:08.976 --> 31:10.569
-Hmm.
Interesting connection.

31:10.604 --> 31:13.979
Well,
I either just walked
into a frame up

31:14.014 --> 31:16.872
or, uh, somebody from my past
is trying to get revenge on me.

31:16.907 --> 31:19.149
-Who hates you?

31:19.184 --> 31:20.876
Besides Griz.

31:20.911 --> 31:23.219
Well, I did put quite a few
prominent people away

31:23.254 --> 31:25.584
when I was
a very famous reporter

31:25.619 --> 31:27.190
at the<i> News Tribune</i>
in Los Angeles.

31:27.225 --> 31:29.093
I looked into
your criminal record.

31:29.128 --> 31:30.193
And?

31:30.228 --> 31:31.359
Bad check charge.

31:33.033 --> 31:34.428
Two contempt of court charges.

31:34.463 --> 31:37.563
A number
of non-payment
of alimony charges.

31:37.598 --> 31:40.665
100 percent of most of those
were dismissed.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.108
You're a bit
of a shady character,
Mr. Fletcher.

31:44.143 --> 31:46.341
But I am adorable.

31:46.376 --> 31:50.114
Come on, guys. Look,
all of the pertinent information
isn't even in yet.

31:50.149 --> 31:54.019
Did you even talk to
or interview this--
this next-door neighbor, Eve?

31:54.054 --> 31:56.252
I mean, she had some very
interesting thoughts
about Mr. Tasserly.

31:56.287 --> 31:58.254
When I showed Eve a picture
of Laurel Goodwin,

31:58.289 --> 32:01.158
she said that she remembered
seeing her
the night of the murder.

32:02.524 --> 32:04.491
With a man
who fits your description.

32:04.526 --> 32:07.197
Well, Eve is a stoner.
I wouldn't trust anything
she has to say.

32:07.232 --> 32:10.695
-We found your fingerprints
on the wine bottle.
-So?

32:11.830 --> 32:13.632
It's the murder weapon.

32:13.667 --> 32:17.537
-Huh.
-Minute traces of hair
and blood from that young woman.

32:17.572 --> 32:21.112
You guys, look,
that bottle was left
on top of a welcome note

32:21.147 --> 32:22.938
for me as a gift.

32:22.973 --> 32:25.446
It was set up that way
so I would have to pick it up.

32:25.481 --> 32:27.283
What note?

32:27.318 --> 32:29.945
Oh, God,
I forgot to give you it.
Here. I still have it.

32:29.980 --> 32:32.519
Withholding evidence.
Not suspicious at all.

32:34.688 --> 32:35.753
"Mr. Locke"?

32:35.788 --> 32:37.425
My pen name. Ralph Locke.

32:37.460 --> 32:38.855
Sounds made up.

32:39.594 --> 32:40.791
It's a pen name.

32:42.465 --> 32:44.432
"Enjoy your stay."

32:44.467 --> 32:47.666
Yeah, Griz,
you better run that down
to forensics,<i> tout de suite.</i>

32:49.967 --> 32:53.111
Oh, are you Ferberizing?
Is that why you're tired?

32:53.146 --> 32:56.180
Yeah, yeah,
we are actually.
We're Ferberizing him.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.745
I never knew any creature
on earth could just cry so much.

33:00.780 --> 33:04.980
But it's gonna be so worth it
when Charlie can self soothe.
Cute!

33:05.015 --> 33:08.291
She's not wrong,
but you have to stick with it.

33:10.526 --> 33:13.164
You shook a police tail today.
You rented a fast car.

33:13.199 --> 33:15.265
Your fingerprints
are on the murder weapon,

33:15.300 --> 33:18.400
and someone matching
your description was seen
with the victim.

33:19.271 --> 33:20.534
I could arrest you.

33:20.569 --> 33:21.964
And we're not
going to arrest him?

33:21.999 --> 33:23.834
Who wants to do that paperwork?
Am I right?

33:25.442 --> 33:29.213
If you did it, Irwin,
I will catch you.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.040
I don't like people
calling me Irwin.

33:32.075 --> 33:34.746
Dang! Pigs have
crazy long orgasms!

34:12.291 --> 34:13.323
Hey!

34:21.564 --> 34:22.761
Hey!

34:22.796 --> 34:23.861
Fuck!

34:24.402 --> 34:25.665
Hey!

34:33.477 --> 34:35.642
Ow.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.591
-I'm here to--
-No.

34:51.264 --> 34:52.296
Yes.

34:53.497 --> 34:54.529
Okay.

34:55.059 --> 34:56.267
Bye.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.236
I'm here to see Frank Jaffe.

34:58.271 --> 35:00.931
Do you have a meeting?
No, just tell him
Fletch is here.

35:00.966 --> 35:02.768
Is that a first name
or a last name?

35:02.803 --> 35:04.176
Just Fletch.

35:04.211 --> 35:05.342
Just Fletch?

35:06.477 --> 35:07.608
Cool.

35:08.446 --> 35:11.282
Larry,
you let this prick in?

35:11.317 --> 35:13.152
Hi, Frank. Thank you.

35:14.815 --> 35:17.486
"Brown Out."
Septic tank explosion.

35:17.521 --> 35:18.751
I get it. Very clever.

35:18.786 --> 35:20.423
Did the Pulitzer committee
see this?

35:20.458 --> 35:21.952
Fuck you.
You still owe me money.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.294
What? No, I don't.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.230
Yes, you do.
For what?

35:25.265 --> 35:27.265
For charging a fuckload
of ridiculous shit
to the<i> News Tribune</i>

35:27.300 --> 35:28.992
and leaving town.
I had to pay for it.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.566
You rented
a fucking carriage horse.
Language.

35:33.130 --> 35:34.668
I paid you back.
No, you didn't.

35:34.703 --> 35:36.241
I apologized for
not paying you back.

35:36.276 --> 35:38.375
No, you didn't.
Well, I meant to.

35:38.410 --> 35:41.444
Listen, where is everybody?
They're still working
from home.

35:41.479 --> 35:43.446
Can you believe it?
The fucking babies.

35:43.481 --> 35:45.283
The place is like
a silent retreat.

35:45.318 --> 35:47.978
And these goddamn millennials,
they're so respectful.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.782
I can't tell you
how much I fucking hate
this place.

35:49.817 --> 35:51.322
You didn't bring anybody
from LA?

35:51.357 --> 35:53.115
Just Pete
who does The Jumble.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.325
Hey, Pete!

35:55.394 --> 35:56.525
Hey, Fletch.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.626
Jesus.

35:58.661 --> 36:00.694
I hate Pete too.
Mr. Excitement.

36:00.729 --> 36:02.025
What do you want,
Fletch?

36:02.060 --> 36:03.466
Can I talk to you
in your office?

36:03.501 --> 36:05.160
My office is
a fucking goldfish bowl.

36:05.195 --> 36:06.964
I can't even scratch
my nuts in there.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.032
Let's go to my real office.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.342
But you can't wear that hat.
They'll chop
your fucking head off.

36:14.677 --> 36:17.040
What brings you to Boston?

36:17.075 --> 36:18.976
'Cause if you're looking
for a job at a newspaper,
you're a fucking idiot,

36:19.011 --> 36:20.549
but I could use you.

36:20.584 --> 36:23.486
I have retired
from reporting.
Oh, good for you.

36:23.521 --> 36:29.723
Mmm. Do you happen to know
if luxury rental cars have
hidden GPS trackers in them?

36:29.758 --> 36:32.220
They do.
In case people steal them.
Why?

36:32.255 --> 36:35.564
Well, the police are
following me around.

36:35.599 --> 36:38.402
Oh, good. I hope
it's for something serious.
I need a pick me up.

36:38.437 --> 36:41.702
First night I'm here,
I get accused of murder.

36:43.068 --> 36:45.200
What?
Wait, the girl on the south end?

36:45.235 --> 36:47.202
That's the one, yes.

36:47.237 --> 36:50.238
Uh, you ever come across
this Detective Morris Monroe?

36:50.273 --> 36:52.009
He seems to think
that I'm the culprit.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.320
Really? Yeah, he's a smart guy.

36:56.389 --> 36:58.213
His father was a cop.
He's from Dorchester.

36:58.248 --> 37:00.017
Uh-- They call him
"Slow Mo Monroe",

37:00.052 --> 37:02.294
because he, uh, takes so long
to solve cases,

37:02.329 --> 37:04.725
but he solves a lot of cases.

37:04.760 --> 37:06.298
You think you could
pull some strings

37:06.333 --> 37:09.092
and, uh, find
a police report
on someone for me?

37:09.127 --> 37:12.194
No, Fletch. No way.
Way too big an ask.

37:13.263 --> 37:15.868
Oh. Just be a real shame
if Daphne found out

37:15.903 --> 37:19.773
that you defiled Clara Snow
in the supply closet
all those years ago.

37:19.808 --> 37:21.709
I mean, especially
in today's climate.

37:21.744 --> 37:24.107
-Mmm.
-You were her boss.

37:24.142 --> 37:27.946
First of all,
it wasn't the supply closet.
It was the copy room.

37:27.981 --> 37:30.388
And it was
a bilateral defiling.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.248
Are you really trying
to blackmail me?

37:34.119 --> 37:35.756
Kinda.

37:35.791 --> 37:37.923
-You wouldn't.
-No, you're probably right.

37:37.958 --> 37:41.124
On the other hand,
I am still under suspicion
for murder.

37:43.029 --> 37:46.371
Whose police report?
Owen Tasserly.

37:46.406 --> 37:47.471
Write it down,
you old lush.

37:49.002 --> 37:51.409
He was arrested a while back
for something.
I don't know what.

37:51.444 --> 37:53.774
But I think he might be
the actual murderer.

37:53.809 --> 37:55.204
I'll see what I can do.

37:55.976 --> 37:57.008
Thank you.

37:58.418 --> 38:01.683
But hey,
if you did kill that girl,
do the right thing.

38:02.620 --> 38:04.389
And give me an exclusive.

38:05.656 --> 38:07.282
Almost great seeing you again,
Frank.

38:08.285 --> 38:10.153
Just glad you kept
your fucking shoes on.

38:11.288 --> 38:13.530
Uh, hi,
is this Tatiana Tasserly?

38:14.566 --> 38:16.225
Yes, uh, it's Frank Jaffe.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.535
I'm the style editor
over at the<i> Boston Sentinel.</i>

38:18.570 --> 38:21.032
Listen, we were thinking
of doing a little piece

38:21.067 --> 38:23.408
on Boston's top
lifestyle curators

38:23.443 --> 38:25.872
and your name was
on the top of our list.

38:26.512 --> 38:27.544
I know.

38:29.009 --> 38:31.416
Well, that's just wonderful.
I would love to do that.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.815
I want a room to tell a story

38:34.850 --> 38:38.247
and all the pieces
are the characters.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.986
I wanna feel like
I'm in the middle
of a conversation.

38:41.021 --> 38:42.526
Between inanimate objects.
Right.

38:42.561 --> 38:45.122
Genius.
Oh, my gosh,
and this thing?

38:45.157 --> 38:48.730
Oh--
This idea of the branch
in the vase?

38:48.765 --> 38:50.930
I have--
How do you come up with this?

38:50.965 --> 38:53.603
-I-- I've only seen branches
on trees!
-Right. I know.

38:53.638 --> 38:55.000
I'm really giving it a moment,

38:55.035 --> 38:58.839
which lures the eye
to this gorgeous table.

38:58.874 --> 39:02.909
And I got this, Frank,
from a convent in Cuba.

39:02.944 --> 39:06.715
Wow. Those Cuban nuns
must be very proud.

39:06.750 --> 39:10.279
-Right?
-Even if they don't have
anywhere to eat anymore. Huh?

39:10.314 --> 39:13.183
Every single piece I curate
is bespoke.

39:13.218 --> 39:16.560
Ooh. Bespoke.
I love that word.

39:16.595 --> 39:17.660
What does it mean again?

39:17.695 --> 39:19.321
Bespoke?
Bespoke.

39:19.356 --> 39:24.568
-Uh, it's when
an object bespeaks. It...
-Right.

39:24.603 --> 39:25.998
...be-talks.

39:26.033 --> 39:27.571
It-- No, wait.

39:30.334 --> 39:35.513
It be-teaches us
something about ourselves.

39:37.407 --> 39:39.011
Wow. Thank you.
Yeah.

39:39.046 --> 39:40.947
I think I have my pull quote.

39:40.982 --> 39:44.720
I mean, so many people, Frank,
are trapped
in a world of sameness.

39:44.755 --> 39:49.384
I just want to surround them
with beautiful things.

39:49.419 --> 39:52.387
Beautiful clothes.
Beautiful food.

39:52.422 --> 39:55.126
Don't you just hate people
who are too poor
to afford beauty?

39:56.965 --> 39:58.833
Um...

39:58.868 --> 40:01.099
The worst.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.267
Well...

40:04.302 --> 40:07.237
Anyway, you're currently
separated from your husband,
Owen Tasserly.

40:07.272 --> 40:09.547
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

40:09.582 --> 40:12.209
Uh, now, is he still co-owner
of Chez Aesthetica?

40:13.751 --> 40:15.718
We had an evolved
and harmonious disuniting.

40:15.753 --> 40:17.918
And he decided
to leave the company.
Hmm.

40:17.953 --> 40:22.186
Now, I-- I'm sure you heard
of the unfortunate incident
at his townhouse.

40:22.221 --> 40:24.694
The-- The murdered woman.
Yikes.

40:24.729 --> 40:26.762
We've been reporting on it
in the paper.

40:27.765 --> 40:30.931
We were totally shocked,
of course, um...

40:30.966 --> 40:33.934
Well, Owen's been away
traveling in Europe.

40:33.969 --> 40:35.507
Right.
So...

40:37.500 --> 40:41.106
I'm always looking for ways
to actuate the senses, so--

40:41.141 --> 40:44.582
Yeah, of course,
but if I could just follow up.

40:44.617 --> 40:47.244
You would make me
kind of a hero
back at the office,

40:47.279 --> 40:49.213
if you could give me
any kind of clue

40:49.248 --> 40:51.787
as to who
might have committed
that murder.

40:51.822 --> 40:53.756
Frank, sorry,
I can't help you there.

40:53.791 --> 40:55.153
Um...

40:57.289 --> 40:58.728
But Owen can be
so irresponsible.

40:58.763 --> 41:00.488
So many people have keys
to that house.

41:00.523 --> 41:02.424
His housekeeper,
his trainer,

41:02.459 --> 41:06.032
his pothead neighbor
who feeds his fish,
and God knows who else.

41:07.431 --> 41:09.233
Why doesn't he
just change the lock?

41:09.268 --> 41:12.467
Frank, I have told him
a million times.

41:14.812 --> 41:17.208
Owen can be
such a fucking idiot sometimes.

41:17.243 --> 41:18.979
Hmm.

41:19.014 --> 41:21.982
I'm so happy you're here,
Frank. Such a fan.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.969
More water.
Your Negroni.

41:42.004 --> 41:44.235
<i>Oh, grazie. Grazie.</i>
Some olives.

41:49.682 --> 41:50.912
Ah, thank you.

41:51.409 --> 41:52.815
It's so nice.

41:52.850 --> 41:56.313
Ah, Fletch, you're late.

41:58.757 --> 42:00.053
Can I get you a drink?
Yes, please.

42:00.088 --> 42:02.022
A vodka gimlet.
Thank you very much.

42:02.057 --> 42:03.958
The staff seems
very smitten with you.

42:03.993 --> 42:07.896
Fletch, I am not going
to have any of your
American double-talk.

42:07.931 --> 42:10.701
I want truth.
Where are my paintings?

42:10.736 --> 42:13.462
Well, see,
here I thought they were
the Count's paintings.

42:13.497 --> 42:16.201
Oh, the Count is dead.

42:16.841 --> 42:18.203
How do you know this?

42:18.238 --> 42:21.140
I know in my heart.
The pain I feel.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.649
You and Angela think

42:24.684 --> 42:29.214
I was only with my Menti,
my<i> pequeno javali,</i>
for money,

42:29.249 --> 42:31.282
but this is lies.

42:31.317 --> 42:32.690
<i> Pequeno javali?</i>

42:32.725 --> 42:37.486
Mmm.
"Little boar" in Portuguese.

42:37.521 --> 42:41.699
I am half Brazilian,
also half Italian
and half French.

42:41.734 --> 42:43.998
That's, uh-- Huh.

42:44.033 --> 42:48.673
Uh-- And what is the Countess
doing here in Boston
in this very expensive hotel?

42:48.708 --> 42:49.740
Thank you very much.

42:49.775 --> 42:51.401
I come to stop you.

42:51.436 --> 42:56.109
I know that you
and Angela plan
to rob my paintings.

42:56.144 --> 42:58.210
Confess, Fletch.

42:58.245 --> 43:01.543
I'm sorry, how do I know
that, uh, you didn't take
the paintings?

43:01.578 --> 43:04.986
Or have the Count kidnapped
or murdered?

43:05.021 --> 43:09.056
I loved my Menti.
I would do nothing
to harm him.

43:09.091 --> 43:12.092
I did not steal
the paintings.

43:12.127 --> 43:15.095
Fletch, if I murder anyone,
I will murder you.

43:16.736 --> 43:20.529
Now, Fletch,
come up to my room.

43:20.564 --> 43:22.333
I have something to show you.

43:22.368 --> 43:24.335
Well, that's not gonna happen,
Your Highness.

43:24.370 --> 43:26.843
Fine. I go up
and come back to show you.

43:26.878 --> 43:28.977
Order me another drink.

43:29.012 --> 43:30.044
<i>Grazie.</i>

43:36.822 --> 43:37.854
Okay.

43:39.990 --> 43:42.287
Morris, I thought I'd stop by.

43:43.686 --> 43:46.654
I couldn't--
He just came here.

43:46.689 --> 43:49.129
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?
Very much so.

43:49.164 --> 43:51.835
It's quite satisfying.
What? No day care today?

43:51.870 --> 43:54.970
My wife had
a doctor's appointment.
My nanny is, um, indisposed.

43:55.005 --> 43:56.840
It's her support dog's birthday.

43:56.875 --> 43:59.238
Is that dog registered anywhere?
I'd love to send it something.

43:59.273 --> 44:00.668
Okay, look,
are you here to confess?

44:00.703 --> 44:02.846
No, but I did have some ideas
about the case.

44:02.881 --> 44:05.475
Goddamn it! We are not
working on this case together,
Irwin.

44:08.513 --> 44:11.547
Come on, just hear me out.
What is happening?

44:12.154 --> 44:14.352
What?

44:14.387 --> 44:16.024
Hands can parade around naked
all day,

44:16.059 --> 44:17.894
but God forbid
you show a few toes?

44:17.929 --> 44:19.588
Now, come on.
Let's talk about
the suspects here.

44:19.623 --> 44:22.690
Number one.
Tatiana Tasserly,
Owen's ex-wife.

44:22.725 --> 44:25.132
-Who you dropped in on today.
-Yes, I did.

44:25.167 --> 44:28.168
Maybe she didn't know
Owen was out of town,
and she wanted to frame him.

44:28.203 --> 44:30.434
-Why?
-Acrimonious divorce.

44:30.469 --> 44:32.744
She wants control
over the company
that they share

44:32.779 --> 44:34.207
and custody of their daughter.

44:34.242 --> 44:36.781
Tatiana Tasserly
was in yoga class that night.

44:36.816 --> 44:38.211
Vinyasa or Bikram?

44:39.544 --> 44:41.016
We'll get back to that.

44:41.051 --> 44:43.282
She could have hired somebody
to do the job.

44:43.317 --> 44:45.515
Second, Eve, the neighbor.

44:45.550 --> 44:47.616
She has a key
to Owen's townhouse,

44:47.651 --> 44:49.684
she feeds his fish
while he's out of town

44:49.719 --> 44:53.061
and just happens
to be in love with him.
She admitted it to me.

44:53.096 --> 44:57.032
O-Okay. Okay.
W-What you're doing right now,
that's called witness tampering.

44:57.067 --> 44:59.067
You're just begging me
to arrest you.

44:59.102 --> 45:02.400
Come on, Morris.
You want me on the outside,
so I can solve this thing,

45:02.435 --> 45:04.138
-and then you can take
the credit.

45:06.538 --> 45:09.946
It's okay,
look at the cow.
Look at Mr. Moo. Mr. Moo.

45:09.981 --> 45:12.674
Daddy's got to talk
to the murderer right now.

45:12.709 --> 45:14.544
The only reason
I haven't arrested you yet

45:14.579 --> 45:17.789
is because I enjoy
watching you dig a deeper hole
for yourself.

45:17.824 --> 45:20.957
Eve has a motive.
Rejection, jealousy.

45:20.992 --> 45:23.190
I hope it's not Eve though.
I really like her.

45:23.225 --> 45:24.488
Such compassion.

45:24.523 --> 45:27.458
And then, of course,
Tasserly himself.

45:27.493 --> 45:29.768
I mean, it is his townhouse.

45:32.399 --> 45:35.532
Tasserly was on a flight
to Paris at- 27 p.m.
that night.

45:35.567 --> 45:38.172
Plenty of time to do a murder
before you get on that plane.

45:38.207 --> 45:39.943
Coroner has time of death
at- 00 p.m.

45:39.978 --> 45:41.571
You're gonna trust a coroner?
They're weirdos.

45:41.606 --> 45:43.243
Tasserly's motive?

45:43.278 --> 45:44.816
He's been a lunatic
since his wife left him.

45:44.851 --> 45:47.379
Oh, and someone
broke into his house
last night.

45:47.414 --> 45:49.986
I don't know who it was.
Couldn't get a good look,
but he had a beard.

45:50.021 --> 45:52.615
Might have been Tasserly.
He might be back in town.

45:52.650 --> 45:54.485
Owen Tasserly broke into
his own house?

45:56.489 --> 45:58.093
-Criminal mastermind.

45:58.128 --> 46:00.557
Whoever it was
did not want to get caught.

46:00.592 --> 46:03.131
He take anything?
Not that I could tell.

46:03.166 --> 46:04.198
Lakers fan?

46:05.102 --> 46:06.937
What do you think?
What about you?

46:08.204 --> 46:10.237
-What do you think?

46:10.272 --> 46:12.470
Charlie, Charlie--
Charlie, I get it.

46:12.505 --> 46:14.670
I'd be crying too
if I was a Celtics fan.

46:15.673 --> 46:17.178
Person of interest
leaving the building.

46:18.181 --> 46:20.049
Slow Mo, he's getting away!

46:20.084 --> 46:22.315
Watch it, pal.
He'll arrest you
at your retirement dinner.

46:22.350 --> 46:25.219
Hey, guy, don't worry.
Monroe's not even sure
who shot Lincoln.

46:27.355 --> 46:29.586
Somebody solve a crime.
How about that?

46:31.964 --> 46:33.326
Can you just--

46:33.361 --> 46:35.163
Oh, thank you. Go ahead.
After you.
Okay.

46:37.530 --> 46:38.661
Are you--

46:39.796 --> 46:41.367
Uh-- Uh, are we going up?

46:42.007 --> 46:43.039
God bless her.

47:04.557 --> 47:05.589
Hmm.

47:32.519 --> 47:34.189
Oh, he's on the move.

47:34.224 --> 47:36.389
If he crosses the state line,
I want to see where he goes.

47:36.424 --> 47:37.720
Hey, you coming?
No.

47:37.755 --> 47:39.854
"No." Love that.

47:39.889 --> 47:44.265
<i>Hummingbirds have a metabolism</i>
<i>77 times faster than ours.</i>

47:44.300 --> 47:47.433
<i>I got a hybrid diet craze</i>
<i>that's just around the corner.</i>

48:31.875 --> 48:33.545
Mr. Horan. How are you?

48:33.580 --> 48:35.349
-I'm well, thank you.
-Here for the clambake?

48:35.384 --> 48:37.351
No, I'm just here
to pick up some things
from the boat.

48:37.386 --> 48:40.189
I actually--
I can't have anything.
I'm allergic to shellfish.

48:40.224 --> 48:41.619
Are you?
Good to see you, Marv.

48:41.654 --> 48:43.918
But I can have corn--
Okay, bye.
Thank you.

48:49.134 --> 48:52.201
I'm allergic to shellfish,
so I can't really have--
Yeah, no.

48:52.236 --> 48:53.928
Okay. Well, see you.

48:53.963 --> 48:56.271
Come on in, Jack.
Save me some corn.

48:57.406 --> 48:59.406
And potato salad.
That's all I can eat.

51:00.265 --> 51:02.232
You have, uh,
permission to board?

51:03.928 --> 51:06.533
I do. Uh, in fact,
the owner of the boat
just texted me

51:06.568 --> 51:08.733
and asked if I could check.

51:08.768 --> 51:10.537
He might have left something
on board.

51:11.210 --> 51:13.540
Uh-huh?
Yeah.

51:13.575 --> 51:16.345
And what's the name
of the owner the boat?

51:16.380 --> 51:18.105
Oh, Ronald Horan.
Ah.

51:18.140 --> 51:20.514
Yeah, he said
he might have left
his lesson plan on board.

51:20.549 --> 51:23.748
Did you know
he's a professor?
No, shit.

51:23.783 --> 51:27.455
Ronnie, uh-- He brags
about it to everyone.

51:27.490 --> 51:28.654
Yeah.
What's your name?

51:28.689 --> 51:30.590
Uh, Sydney Blake.
Ah.

51:30.625 --> 51:32.086
I'm, uh, Kenton Alfred.

51:32.121 --> 51:35.562
I'm the commodore here
of the club.

51:35.597 --> 51:40.567
Hey, your old man
isn't Jefferson Blake,
is he?

51:41.471 --> 51:42.635
My uncle.

51:42.670 --> 51:44.802
Ah!
Yeah. That's--

51:44.837 --> 51:48.245
Well, your uncle
and I got into
a little mischief...

51:48.280 --> 51:50.071
Oh.
...back at Exeter.

51:50.106 --> 51:53.910
We once stole
a homecoming float

51:53.945 --> 51:58.882
and-- and crashed it
right into a goal post.

51:58.917 --> 52:02.358
-We were a little, uh, stewed.
-Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

52:02.393 --> 52:04.591
Nothing like a little
consequence-free fun
for the rich, huh?

52:04.626 --> 52:07.462
How is the old the guy doing
these days?

52:07.497 --> 52:10.993
Oh, you didn't hear?
No, uh-- We lost uncle Jeff.

52:11.028 --> 52:14.634
No, no.
I'm sorry,
what happened?

52:14.669 --> 52:17.868
Yeah, he swam right into
a-- a boat propeller. Yeah.

52:17.903 --> 52:19.309
Oh, no.
Yeah.

52:19.344 --> 52:21.245
Uh, just basically,
you know, pureed him.

52:21.280 --> 52:23.445
Oh, good Lord!
Just a mess.

52:23.480 --> 52:26.107
-He just looked like sauce.
It was not great.
-Oh.

52:28.848 --> 52:32.223
Well, see you around.

52:47.064 --> 52:48.371
Mr. Fletcher.

52:49.935 --> 52:51.000
Morris.

52:52.410 --> 52:53.838
Are you really an inspector?

52:53.873 --> 52:56.313
The mayor bestowed
that special rank on me

52:56.348 --> 52:59.448
after I solved the murder
of a city council woman.

52:59.483 --> 53:03.716
She got stabbed multiple times
with an ice pick
in her own bathtub.

53:04.719 --> 53:06.081
I mean, I guess if you work
in politics,

53:06.116 --> 53:08.017
you probably do have to take
a lot of baths.

53:08.052 --> 53:11.625
We obtained
surveillance footage
from a store around the corner.

53:11.660 --> 53:13.330
Where the fudge is made?

53:13.365 --> 53:16.399
And the footage shows
Laurel Goodwin
walking with a man

53:16.434 --> 53:20.161
whose height and build
is very similar to yours.

53:20.196 --> 53:23.032
Well, that doesn't rule out
Tatianna or Eve,

53:23.067 --> 53:26.035
or anybody really
hiring someone
to do their dirty work.

53:26.070 --> 53:27.542
Did you see his face?

53:27.577 --> 53:30.105
He was wearing a purple hat
with a yellow logo.

53:31.515 --> 53:33.515
Exactly like
the one on your head.

53:33.550 --> 53:35.583
You fucking with me?
Come on.

53:35.618 --> 53:37.552
Be honest, Morris.
Are you fucking with me?

53:37.587 --> 53:41.182
Mr. Fletcher,
when have you ever known me
to fuck with you?

53:48.730 --> 53:50.862
Okay. Well, I--
I see that, sure,

53:50.897 --> 53:54.470
but it's probably
a Minnesota Vikings hat,
you know?

53:55.473 --> 53:57.473
Any theories?
Yes.

53:58.300 --> 54:00.036
Irwin Maurice Fletcher,

54:00.071 --> 54:02.445
you're under arrest
for the murder
of Laurel Goodwin.

54:02.480 --> 54:05.877
Come on now! That's--
You're not playing fair.

54:05.912 --> 54:08.275
Can you do me a favor?
Read me my rights in Italian.

54:08.310 --> 54:09.551
I've been working
really hard on it.

54:09.586 --> 54:11.421
Let's go.
Okay, ow.

54:13.656 --> 54:15.216
Andy, it's me.

54:15.251 --> 54:17.460
Oh, I'm glad you're awake.
Listen, I need--

54:19.123 --> 54:21.090
You're what?

54:21.125 --> 54:23.664
Oh. Well, in that case,
I'm really glad you're awake.

54:24.568 --> 54:26.799
Yes, what aren't you wearing?

54:28.506 --> 54:31.001
Oh, goodness.
You woke up
in a very naughty mood.

54:32.609 --> 54:34.774
What?
No, I don't need
a reason to call you.

54:34.809 --> 54:38.547
I was just calling.
I happen to be calling you,
you know, to hear your voice.

54:39.979 --> 54:43.486
And I need you
to bail me out of jail.

54:48.053 --> 54:50.790
Come on, Griz.
Is this about the bus?

54:51.628 --> 54:52.924
It was nothing personal.

54:55.665 --> 54:56.796
You're free to go.

54:57.898 --> 54:59.260
How can I
make it up to you?

54:59.295 --> 55:00.602
Are you set for luggage?

55:01.869 --> 55:03.374
I'll let you
take me to dinner?

55:05.037 --> 55:07.411
I'd rather throw myself
into Boston Harbor.

55:10.207 --> 55:11.239
Seems extreme.

55:14.486 --> 55:15.815
Go, Lakers.

55:19.854 --> 55:22.085
-Hey.
-<i> I got that</i>
<i>police report you wanted.</i>

55:22.120 --> 55:24.153
<i>I just emailed it to you.</i>
<i>It's encrypted.</i>

55:24.188 --> 55:27.123
-Oh, good.
Uh, what's the password?
-<i> Go fuck yourself.</i>

55:27.158 --> 55:28.960
-Frank, don't be an asshole.

55:36.574 --> 55:38.376
Okay.

55:52.887 --> 55:57.725
Fletch,
how dare you abandon me
at the hotel yesterday?

55:57.760 --> 56:02.158
The Countess de Grassi
has never been left alone
at the table.

56:02.193 --> 56:06.536
-Countess, what are you doing?
-Ah, you were right.
The hotel is too expensive.

56:06.571 --> 56:09.737
I can't get Menti's money.

56:09.772 --> 56:12.366
Everything is all freezed.

56:12.401 --> 56:14.544
Uh, why did you come here?

56:14.579 --> 56:18.339
Why should
the Countess de Grassi
stay in a too expensive hotel

56:18.374 --> 56:21.683
when her almost son is here

56:21.718 --> 56:25.654
in this nice big townhouse

56:25.689 --> 56:26.787
near very good shopping--

56:26.822 --> 56:28.217
You can't stay here.

56:28.252 --> 56:30.560
What would
poor dead Menti say

56:30.595 --> 56:34.388
if he know the Countess
is in some fleabag hotel?

56:34.423 --> 56:35.862
Hmm?

56:35.897 --> 56:37.600
No. No happy.

56:37.635 --> 56:42.033
Now, Fletch,
where is my room?
I'm sorry. I--

56:42.068 --> 56:44.574
You know, I came here to work.
You're just gonna be
in the way.

56:44.609 --> 56:46.741
Oh, you bet your big cock
I'm going to be in the way.

56:46.776 --> 56:49.040
I am going
to keep an eye on you.

56:49.075 --> 56:51.042
Okay, you can stay one night,

56:51.077 --> 56:53.110
and then we're gonna look
for a nice mid-range hotel
for you.

56:53.145 --> 56:55.915
What is this "mid-range"?

56:55.950 --> 56:57.983
Now come, Fletch. Come. Sit.

56:59.184 --> 57:02.790
I now show you
what I want to show you
at the hotel

57:02.825 --> 57:05.188
when you leave me
with<i> il conto.</i>

57:05.223 --> 57:06.992
I found this at the villa.

57:07.797 --> 57:10.831
Photos. Angela's photos.
Hmm.

57:11.966 --> 57:15.231
Did you know Angela
went to university

57:15.266 --> 57:17.640
here in Boston for a year?

57:17.675 --> 57:18.971
No, it never came up.

57:19.908 --> 57:22.612
Hmm.
Do you know who that is?

57:22.647 --> 57:24.372
Turn it over.

57:24.407 --> 57:27.914
Owen Tasserly.
Did you know they were friends?

57:27.949 --> 57:30.246
She might have mentioned it.
Oh.

57:30.281 --> 57:31.951
Andy made all the arrangements.

57:31.986 --> 57:34.987
Fletch,
listen to the Contessa.

57:35.022 --> 57:39.090
Angela cannot be trusted.
Why is she not here?

57:39.125 --> 57:41.092
She's trying to find
her father, your husband.

57:41.127 --> 57:44.260
Oh, Fletch. Fletch.

57:44.295 --> 57:46.933
I know this is
so bad news for you.

57:46.968 --> 57:48.770
Now, where is the shower?

57:48.805 --> 57:50.134
You want to take a shower?

57:50.169 --> 57:53.335
No, I want you to take a shower.
You stink.

57:53.370 --> 57:54.677
I make drinks.

58:00.883 --> 58:02.212
Countess, do you mind?

58:02.247 --> 58:05.182
Fletch, I found
a dead fish in your tank.

58:06.691 --> 58:10.484
Okay, well,
we'll light a candle for it.

58:10.519 --> 58:15.357
-Now, could you please--
-Oh, Fletch, I am so sad.

58:15.392 --> 58:17.425
My Menti is dead.

58:17.460 --> 58:20.901
My<i> chiromante</i> tell me
the kidnappers
have killed him.

58:20.936 --> 58:24.333
Where did all your clothes go?
What is the<i> chiromante?</i>

58:24.368 --> 58:28.777
How do you say?
Uh, is a fortune teller.

58:30.176 --> 58:33.749
She tell me
they take my Menti,
they put him in a coffin,

58:33.784 --> 58:36.719
they fill it with cats,
and they bury him alive.

58:36.754 --> 58:39.051
Is horrible, no?
Well,
it sounds very implausible.

58:39.086 --> 58:41.350
Fletch, is no time
for a wisecrack.

58:41.385 --> 58:42.890
My Menti is allergic.

58:42.925 --> 58:44.760
Now, shall I make us negronis?

58:44.795 --> 58:46.597
Sure.
Okay.

58:46.632 --> 58:49.127
Go buy gin, vermouth,
Campari and oranges.

58:49.162 --> 58:51.899
Can I please have
the bathroom to myself?

58:51.934 --> 58:55.232
Fletch,
you parade around me naked,

58:55.267 --> 58:56.640
but I am not going
to sleep with you.

58:56.675 --> 58:57.872
You came in here.

58:57.907 --> 58:59.302
Please do not put
too much vermouth

58:59.337 --> 59:00.567
in my Negroni.

59:00.602 --> 59:01.645
Hurry up.

59:17.223 --> 59:19.256
<i>I got eyes on Fletcher.</i>

59:19.291 --> 59:21.929
<i>In the alleyway,</i>
<i>headed towards your end</i>
<i>of the street. Over.</i>

59:23.064 --> 59:24.525
Copy that. Roger.

59:26.397 --> 59:28.001
Oh, no! Oh, no!

59:40.147 --> 59:42.444
-You Irwin?
-Call me Fletch.

1:00:05.238 --> 1:00:09.174
Really quite extraordinary.
Yes, it is.

1:00:09.209 --> 1:00:13.145
He's asking 25 million.
My advice is to counter at 20.

1:00:14.753 --> 1:00:17.281
Well, okay.
Make that counter.

1:00:17.954 --> 1:00:19.118
Fantastic.

1:00:24.653 --> 1:00:26.455
Hey, uh, excuse me,

1:00:26.490 --> 1:00:28.996
do you happen to know
where I can maybe buy
some fireworks?

1:00:29.031 --> 1:00:31.064
Yeah, New Hampshire.

1:00:31.099 --> 1:00:33.594
<i>Where are you, Fletch?</i>
<i>I called a few times.</i>

1:00:33.629 --> 1:00:36.498
<i>My lawyer told me</i>
<i>that the fucking Countess</i>
<i>has gone to Boston.</i>

1:00:37.237 --> 1:00:38.500
<i>Has she tried to contact you?</i>

1:00:39.844 --> 1:00:43.813
<i>I'm coming to Boston tomorrow.</i>
<i>My flight arrives at- 32 p.m.</i>

1:00:43.848 --> 1:00:47.014
<i>Can you pick me up?</i>
<i>I miss you.</i>

1:00:47.049 --> 1:00:48.543
Ciao, amore.

1:01:46.141 --> 1:01:47.206
What the--

1:01:48.638 --> 1:01:50.341
The fuck?

1:02:23.805 --> 1:02:26.883
It was the teenagers.
They were drinking.

1:02:26.918 --> 1:02:28.742
So sorry about your window.

1:02:28.777 --> 1:02:30.579
This boat is private property.

1:02:30.614 --> 1:02:34.088
-Yeah, I know.
-No one is allowed on
but me.

1:02:34.123 --> 1:02:36.057
And I am bringing in
my own private security.

1:02:36.092 --> 1:02:38.961
Oh, hey. I know the guys
who used to guard Peter Wolf.

1:02:38.996 --> 1:02:40.292
Shit.

1:02:40.327 --> 1:02:42.063
-The J. Geils Band?
-No.

1:02:42.098 --> 1:02:45.099
My security team will be here
within the hour. Thank you.

1:02:45.134 --> 1:02:47.497
Come on.
Angel is a centerfold?

1:02:47.532 --> 1:02:50.808
I don't know what that is
and I hope that I never do.

1:02:56.607 --> 1:02:58.343
How long have you guys
done security?

1:02:59.016 --> 1:03:00.081
About eight years.

1:03:15.857 --> 1:03:17.901
I've never felt the need
to have a gun,

1:03:17.936 --> 1:03:19.903
because I have sort of
an inner calm.

1:03:23.172 --> 1:03:25.370
Oh, for--
Let's go check that out.

1:03:25.405 --> 1:03:27.339
Let's go.

1:03:27.374 --> 1:03:31.079
Uh, I'm coming. I'll--
Sorry. I'll help.

1:03:31.114 --> 1:03:34.610
Pretty dark,
so be careful, guys.
It's really dark.

1:03:34.645 --> 1:03:36.645
-Okay, Marv.
-Thanks, bud.

1:04:27.599 --> 1:04:30.006
It's just
those same inebriated kids.

1:04:30.041 --> 1:04:33.768
Probably just doing pranks,
and, you know, just trying
to get hits online.

1:04:33.803 --> 1:04:35.077
Trying to go viral.

1:04:35.112 --> 1:04:37.079
I've been doing this 21 years.

1:04:37.114 --> 1:04:40.709
When I, uh-- When I was 17,
I stopped a burglary at Caldor,

1:04:40.744 --> 1:04:44.020
and I kind of was like,
"You know, I think
this is the thing for me."

1:04:44.055 --> 1:04:45.846
I-- I tripped the guy,
but still.

1:04:45.881 --> 1:04:51.225
Hey, you guys like J. Geils?
"Freeze-Frame"? "Love Stinks"?

1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:53.029
I think Horan's
never even heard of them.

1:04:53.064 --> 1:04:54.921
I mean, I get you don't know
"Whammer Jammer".

1:04:54.956 --> 1:04:56.824
First record.
Who's gonna hear that?

1:04:56.859 --> 1:04:59.431
Harmonic instrumental.
I mean, whoa.

1:05:00.071 --> 1:05:01.565
But "Centerfold"?

1:05:11.082 --> 1:05:12.840
You really need
to get some sleep.

1:05:12.875 --> 1:05:17.350
Oh, my God.
No, I don't, actually.

1:05:21.818 --> 1:05:25.193
Fletch, I told you
I not sleep with you.

1:05:25.228 --> 1:05:29.956
Countess, this is my bed.
There are three other rooms.

1:05:29.991 --> 1:05:31.727
Have you found my paintings?

1:05:31.762 --> 1:05:33.564
I wasn't looking for your--
for the-- for the paintings.

1:05:33.599 --> 1:05:36.501
I think the wicked Angela
has you under a spell.

1:05:36.536 --> 1:05:40.439
For your information,
I'm crazy about Angela.

1:05:40.474 --> 1:05:43.079
I'm actually thinking
of asking her to marry me.
Oh, no.

1:05:43.114 --> 1:05:45.345
Don't waste
your third marriage on her.

1:05:45.380 --> 1:05:50.614
Menti was my third marriage,
and, oh,
he was my best one yet.

1:05:50.649 --> 1:05:52.880
You know,
I wish you and Angela
could get to know one another.

1:05:52.915 --> 1:05:54.420
I think
you would actually be friends.

1:05:54.455 --> 1:05:56.488
She hate the Countess.

1:05:56.523 --> 1:05:58.952
I think
she just doesn't know
the Countess.

1:05:58.987 --> 1:06:02.593
Fletch,
are you trying to seduce me?

1:06:02.628 --> 1:06:05.794
-That is not at all
what's happening right now.
-Okay, Fletch. Okay.

1:06:05.829 --> 1:06:08.104
-Maybe only this once.
Come. Come.
-Okay.

1:06:08.139 --> 1:06:10.073
I'm gonna go
to one of the spare rooms.

1:06:12.374 --> 1:06:15.672
Hmm. Bravo, Fletch.
Bravo, bravo.

1:06:15.707 --> 1:06:20.380
You have passed my test.
Now you can be my son-in-law.

1:06:20.415 --> 1:06:23.911
-It's a nice big hairy chest,
I see.

1:06:23.946 --> 1:06:26.551
You have a nice chest,
Fletch.
Thank you.

1:06:30.161 --> 1:06:31.985
Morris! Morris! Morris!

1:06:32.020 --> 1:06:33.723
Jesus, Griz.
Sorry.

1:06:33.758 --> 1:06:35.560
Oh, my God.
I have something for you.

1:06:35.595 --> 1:06:37.694
There was an incident
last night
at the Mayflower Yacht Club

1:06:37.729 --> 1:06:39.663
and these kids,
they were shooting out
some fireworks.

1:06:39.698 --> 1:06:42.369
And I think
that they went astray
onto this one yacht.

1:06:42.932 --> 1:06:43.964
Yeah?

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.341
The yacht belongs
to Ronald Horan.

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:52.115
We found Fletcher
parked in front
of the Horan Gallery.

1:06:52.150 --> 1:06:53.710
Right.
So do you think that--

1:06:53.745 --> 1:06:56.911
This stupid idiot moron
has something to do with this.

1:06:57.485 --> 1:06:58.550
Fuck, yes.

1:06:58.585 --> 1:07:00.090
Yeah. Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah!

1:07:00.125 --> 1:07:01.421
Ow! Oh, ow.

1:07:02.490 --> 1:07:05.161
Well, he told me
his name was Ralph Locke.

1:07:05.196 --> 1:07:07.196
And that's why
I wanted to see you.

1:07:07.231 --> 1:07:09.429
Be very careful doing business
with Mr. Fletcher.

1:07:09.464 --> 1:07:12.025
Thank you, Inspector.
I appreciate that very much.

1:07:26.745 --> 1:07:28.514
I missed you, Fletch. Mmm.
Oh.

1:07:28.549 --> 1:07:30.582
I missed you, too.
I missed you so much.

1:07:30.617 --> 1:07:31.748
Mmm.

1:07:34.621 --> 1:07:36.357
Okay. Okay. Sure.

1:07:36.392 --> 1:07:40.130
-So, has the Countess
tried to contact you?
-Yes.

1:07:40.165 --> 1:07:42.396
Shit. What is she up to?

1:07:42.431 --> 1:07:44.398
Well, spying on me.

1:07:44.433 --> 1:07:46.697
Where is she staying?

1:07:46.732 --> 1:07:48.732
At the townhouse with me.

1:07:49.471 --> 1:07:50.767
Are you kidding me?

1:07:50.802 --> 1:07:52.604
How could you let her
stay with you?

1:07:52.639 --> 1:07:55.068
She showed up with suitcases.
I can't get her to leave.

1:07:56.038 --> 1:07:57.279
Did you have sex with her?

1:07:57.314 --> 1:07:58.610
No. I slept in the other room.

1:07:59.514 --> 1:08:00.645
I don't believe you.

1:08:01.747 --> 1:08:03.285
Andy, why did you lie to me
about Tasserly?

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:05.320
What?
What are you talking about?

1:08:05.355 --> 1:08:08.191
You didn't tell me
you did a year of college
in Boston

1:08:08.226 --> 1:08:10.050
and that you knew Owen Tasserly.

1:08:10.085 --> 1:08:11.755
Of course I did.
No.

1:08:11.790 --> 1:08:14.791
You said you got the townhouse
off a luxury rental website.

1:08:14.826 --> 1:08:16.991
Fletch,
you're becoming paranoid.

1:08:17.026 --> 1:08:20.632
-Listen, I think Owen Tasserly
killed Laurel Goodwin.

1:08:20.667 --> 1:08:22.634
He was arrested
for bonking his neighbor
over the head

1:08:22.669 --> 1:08:24.372
with a very heavy object.
He's violent.

1:08:24.407 --> 1:08:26.572
He could have easily
bonked Laurel
over the head too.

1:08:26.607 --> 1:08:29.003
Owen's not a serial "bonker".

1:08:29.038 --> 1:08:31.104
Well, look, he's going through
a hellish divorce.

1:08:31.139 --> 1:08:33.106
He's abusing drugs.
He's-- He's a mess.

1:08:33.141 --> 1:08:34.382
Yeah.

1:08:34.417 --> 1:08:36.747
He told me all about that.
<i>Poverino.</i>

1:08:36.782 --> 1:08:39.079
-What? You talk to him?
-Yes, we talk.

1:08:39.114 --> 1:08:40.586
He's an old friend.

1:08:40.621 --> 1:08:43.325
Does Owen know
any martial arts?
What? No.

1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:45.426
-Does he have a beard now?
-How should I know?

1:08:45.461 --> 1:08:47.120
You just said you talk to him
all the time.

1:08:47.155 --> 1:08:49.089
You can't hear a beard
over the phone.

1:08:49.124 --> 1:08:51.498
I don't know.
Maybe you Facetime
or send each other texts.

1:08:51.533 --> 1:08:53.665
I just got off
a very long flight.
I'm very tired.

1:08:53.700 --> 1:08:55.601
-You're attacking me
with all these questions.
-Okay.

1:08:55.636 --> 1:08:58.131
Okay. I'm sorry.

1:09:04.315 --> 1:09:06.546
<i>Grazie.</i>

1:09:06.581 --> 1:09:10.011
-Angela!
-Sylvia!

1:09:19.088 --> 1:09:20.758
Fletch,
we're gonna cook you dinner.

1:09:39.009 --> 1:09:40.679
Okay, listen to this.

1:09:40.714 --> 1:09:42.648
Our Ronald Horan
is under investigation

1:09:42.683 --> 1:09:44.848
for a possible
false insurance claim

1:09:44.883 --> 1:09:46.212
about a robbery at his gallery.

1:09:46.247 --> 1:09:47.818
What is Irwin up to
with this guy?

1:09:47.853 --> 1:09:50.293
Also, you asked me to search
the Italian papers.

1:09:50.328 --> 1:09:51.690
Check that out.

1:09:53.155 --> 1:09:54.330
What's it say?

1:09:56.664 --> 1:09:58.862
Oh, in English.

1:09:58.897 --> 1:10:02.129
Fletcher's at a press conference
about a kidnapping
of the Count de Grassi,

1:10:02.164 --> 1:10:04.032
father of Angela de Grassi.

1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:06.034
Andy Angela.

1:10:06.069 --> 1:10:08.036
And the kidnappers are demanding
a Picasso painting

1:10:08.071 --> 1:10:09.840
from the Count's collection
as ransom.

1:10:09.875 --> 1:10:12.414
But Angela's saying
that the painting's been stolen.

1:10:12.449 --> 1:10:14.141
Hmm.

1:10:14.176 --> 1:10:15.912
So, are we gonna
bring Fletcher in?

1:10:18.587 --> 1:10:21.115
Not yet. Keep looking.

1:10:21.755 --> 1:10:22.787
Okay.

1:10:30.665 --> 1:10:32.225
-Wait a minute.

1:10:38.343 --> 1:10:41.168
Just like family,
we are together.
Mmm.

1:10:41.203 --> 1:10:42.609
If only Menti were here.

1:10:42.644 --> 1:10:44.270
Dear papa.

1:10:46.912 --> 1:10:49.275
<i>Oh, grazie.</i>
Mm-hmm.

1:10:49.310 --> 1:10:52.212
-Mmm. I'll get it.

1:10:52.247 --> 1:10:54.390
Who is it?
No one you know.

1:10:54.425 --> 1:10:57.118
-Is it someone I know?
-Fletch, set another place.

1:11:00.695 --> 1:11:02.464
-Owen!
-Angela.

1:11:02.499 --> 1:11:05.258
Come into your own house.
<i>Ciao, amore.</i>

1:11:07.735 --> 1:11:10.164
This is my boyfriend
who's been staying here.

1:11:10.837 --> 1:11:13.772
And Sylvia, my stepmother.

1:11:13.807 --> 1:11:17.270
I know. I know.
We look like<i> sorelle.</i>
Sisters.

1:11:17.305 --> 1:11:18.612
Uh-huh.

1:11:20.011 --> 1:11:22.847
-Quite an art collection
you have, Mr. Tasserly.
-Thank you.

1:11:24.081 --> 1:11:26.851
-That my shirt?
-No. Maybe.

1:11:26.886 --> 1:11:31.724
-Owen,
you are an art dealer, no?
-I'm an art broker.

1:11:31.759 --> 1:11:34.793
-You study any martial arts
by any chance?
-Muay Thai.

1:11:35.961 --> 1:11:37.697
-Muay Thai.

1:11:37.732 --> 1:11:40.436
Look, I owe you
a big apology
about the other night.

1:11:40.471 --> 1:11:42.295
What? What happened?

1:11:42.330 --> 1:11:45.837
I let myself in
because I needed something
urgently.

1:11:45.872 --> 1:11:49.445
I honestly assumed
nobody would be staying here
after there was a murder.

1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:53.515
I didn't know it was you,
or I wouldn't have done that.

1:11:53.550 --> 1:11:56.111
-What did you do?
-Oh, he kicked my ass.

1:11:56.146 --> 1:11:57.244
Uh...

1:11:57.279 --> 1:11:58.718
What did you need so urgently?

1:11:59.523 --> 1:12:01.182
Some medication.

1:12:01.217 --> 1:12:03.855
Medication? For what?

1:12:03.890 --> 1:12:10.191
Um... It's a rare disorder.
Segegenisis.

1:12:10.226 --> 1:12:12.633
It's-- It's--
It's a stom-- stomach thing.

1:12:12.668 --> 1:12:15.064
It's a-- You get it
from eating too much...

1:12:17.035 --> 1:12:18.067
porridge.

1:12:19.301 --> 1:12:21.675
Owen, come on.
Tell us the truth.

1:12:21.710 --> 1:12:25.008
Fine. I snuck in
to get a bottle of Oxy
I had in the drawer.

1:12:25.043 --> 1:12:26.878
Oh.

1:12:26.913 --> 1:12:30.618
I flew back from Paris early
because I know
I need to get help.

1:12:30.653 --> 1:12:31.850
But I was weak, okay?

1:12:31.885 --> 1:12:34.523
Did you come here tonight
to see me

1:12:34.558 --> 1:12:35.887
or to look for more Oxy?

1:12:38.859 --> 1:12:40.463
Can't it be both?

1:12:40.498 --> 1:12:42.993
<i> Ay.</i>
Owen, you're going to rehab.

1:12:43.028 --> 1:12:45.226
Anything else you want
to tell us about, Owen?

1:12:45.261 --> 1:12:47.327
-Where are my paintings?
-What is she talking about?

1:12:47.362 --> 1:12:48.999
Is the Picasso here?

1:12:49.034 --> 1:12:50.473
-Sylvia.
-What?

1:12:50.508 --> 1:12:51.738
-Come on,
you're being ridiculous.
-No.

1:12:51.773 --> 1:12:53.971
Owen knows nothing
about the paintings

1:12:54.006 --> 1:12:57.205
that you
and your criminal brothers
stole.

1:12:59.011 --> 1:13:00.373
There it is.

1:13:03.521 --> 1:13:05.620
Ladies. Ladies.

1:13:07.888 --> 1:13:11.890
Ah, Rothko.
Oh, Lee Krasner. Miró...

1:13:16.259 --> 1:13:17.291
Ladies.

1:13:23.002 --> 1:13:24.771
-Ladies.
-Where's Frida Kahlo?

1:13:26.203 --> 1:13:28.610
Owen,
who are these loud Italians?

1:13:29.910 --> 1:13:31.745
Tatiana, thanks for coming.

1:13:31.780 --> 1:13:32.812
Oh, shit.

1:13:32.847 --> 1:13:36.376
What? Frank!

1:13:36.411 --> 1:13:37.916
Frank? That's Ralph.

1:13:37.951 --> 1:13:39.555
He's the guy
who's been renting my place.

1:13:39.590 --> 1:13:41.249
He told me he's Frank Jaffe
from the<i> Sentinel.</i>

1:13:41.284 --> 1:13:43.526
Then he came over
and interviewed me.

1:13:43.561 --> 1:13:45.418
So there is an explanation.
Uh-huh.

1:13:45.453 --> 1:13:47.893
You came over to my wife's house
pretending to be a journalist?

1:13:47.928 --> 1:13:50.324
Well, I was a reporter
of some repute.

1:13:50.359 --> 1:13:52.535
-What are you playing at, bro?
-What is going on here?

1:13:52.570 --> 1:13:54.130
Okay. A lot of balls
in the air right now.

1:13:54.165 --> 1:13:56.363
-Fletch, what did you do now?
-He killed Frida Kahlo.

1:13:56.398 --> 1:13:57.606
I knew you were a phony.

1:13:58.169 --> 1:13:59.707
A style editor?

1:13:59.742 --> 1:14:01.467
He doesn't even know
what bespoke means.

1:14:01.502 --> 1:14:03.711
-Doesn't even know
what bespoke-- The fuck, dude!
-No.

1:14:03.746 --> 1:14:05.614
You better be able
to explain yourself.

1:14:05.649 --> 1:14:07.308
-Okay. Well, it's not
a short explain--

1:14:07.343 --> 1:14:08.782
Jesus! Fuck!

1:14:08.817 --> 1:14:10.586
All right.
You have got to stop
hitting me!

1:14:10.621 --> 1:14:12.753
I'm calling the cops
on this piece of shit right now.

1:14:12.788 --> 1:14:16.119
Call the cops. Please.
Ask for Inspector Morris Monroe.
He's a smart guy.

1:14:16.154 --> 1:14:18.484
-You can use my name.
-Which one? Fletch?
Frank? Ralph?

1:14:18.519 --> 1:14:21.091
-Owen, stop! Stop!
Everybody calm down!
-Ow.

1:14:21.126 --> 1:14:22.158
Hey, hey,<i> basta.</i>

1:14:22.193 --> 1:14:24.325
You! Yes.

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:26.767
Put your phone down. Yes.

1:14:26.802 --> 1:14:29.330
Let's all take a breath.
Listen to me.

1:14:29.365 --> 1:14:32.839
Fletch has been investigating
the murder.

1:14:32.874 --> 1:14:37.437
I'm sure that's why
he was at your house, Tatiana.

1:14:37.472 --> 1:14:40.341
Oh, wow. What smells so good?

1:14:40.376 --> 1:14:42.651
Wow. Are you guys doing a seder?

1:14:42.686 --> 1:14:44.015
Eve, you're here.

1:14:44.050 --> 1:14:45.511
-Who is this?
-Of course you're here.

1:14:45.546 --> 1:14:48.316
-Why are you here?
And who is this?

1:14:48.351 --> 1:14:50.021
I don't know.

1:14:50.056 --> 1:14:52.122
We met on the street.
He asked to come up
and see you.

1:14:52.157 --> 1:14:54.124
-I let him in.
-Cool.

1:14:54.159 --> 1:14:55.323
Are you Irwin Fletcher?

1:14:55.358 --> 1:14:56.599
Yes, I am.

1:14:58.394 --> 1:14:59.866
Whoa!

1:14:59.901 --> 1:15:01.901
I mean, no, I'm not.
I always get that wrong.

1:15:01.936 --> 1:15:03.540
My name is Bart Robinson.

1:15:04.675 --> 1:15:06.609
I was engaged
to marry Laurel Goodwin.

1:15:08.206 --> 1:15:10.173
Okay. Hey, buddy.
No one's getting shot today.

1:15:10.208 --> 1:15:12.175
Let's get you sobered up, huh?

1:15:12.210 --> 1:15:14.375
-Get some coffee in you.
This is Sylvia.
-Please. You come to Sylvia.

1:15:14.410 --> 1:15:16.718
-She's gonna get you
some nice food.
-I'll make you a plate of food.

1:15:16.753 --> 1:15:18.588
-We'll be okay.
-What kind of food?

1:15:18.623 --> 1:15:21.151
Get you a bite to eat.
We're gonna take care of ya.

1:15:21.186 --> 1:15:24.385
What is that?
Owen, is that Oxy?

1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:26.189
I have a prescription.
Right now? Really?

1:15:26.224 --> 1:15:29.698
Owen, I told you.
Booze and pills,
it's a bad road.

1:15:29.733 --> 1:15:32.195
-People love you, Owen.
-Oh, Eve.

1:15:33.033 --> 1:15:35.968
-Oh!
-Owen!

1:15:36.003 --> 1:15:37.838
Owen, you didn't sign
the fucking paper!

1:15:39.501 --> 1:15:41.501
That dog is make<i> pipí</i>
on the carpet.

1:15:41.536 --> 1:15:44.746
-Oh, yeah. She's hungry.

1:15:48.081 --> 1:15:51.247
Um, I have to go.

1:15:51.282 --> 1:15:53.513
-Wait, what? Why?
-Ah,<i> bravo.</i>

1:15:53.548 --> 1:15:56.791
Fletch, this is something
I need to do right now.

1:15:56.826 --> 1:15:58.485
And I will not
be cross-examined.

1:15:58.520 --> 1:15:59.893
-Let it out, buddy.
-Yes.

1:15:59.928 --> 1:16:02.159
-Let it out. Let it out.

1:16:02.194 --> 1:16:03.996
You are being impossible.

1:16:04.031 --> 1:16:05.602
This is delicious.

1:16:06.627 --> 1:16:08.770
Are you really not gonna
tell me anything?

1:16:10.532 --> 1:16:13.038
Andy, don't do this.
You're on thin ice, Fletch.

1:16:13.942 --> 1:16:15.073
Angela, right?

1:16:15.603 --> 1:16:16.679
I'm on thin ice?

1:17:51.732 --> 1:17:53.237
God.

1:17:56.473 --> 1:17:58.638
Mr. Horan, lovely to see you.

1:17:58.673 --> 1:18:00.673
So, uh-- It's last call
at the clubhouse.

1:18:00.708 --> 1:18:03.181
Oh, well. Better hurry.
Yeah, you gotta--
better get in there.

1:18:03.216 --> 1:18:06.646
You know, if they're closed,
there's-- must be Scuppers--
Cheers. Thank you.

1:18:46.787 --> 1:18:48.325
-Hey, Commodore.
-Hey, Ron.

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:02.174
Shit.

1:19:02.209 --> 1:19:04.770
You still haven't explained
why you were avoiding me.

1:19:04.805 --> 1:19:08.675
I was not avoiding you.
I was trying to protect you.

1:19:08.710 --> 1:19:10.512
You lie some fucking bullshit!

1:19:10.547 --> 1:19:12.250
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

1:19:12.285 --> 1:19:15.286
Angela, I told you.
I am under investigation.

1:19:15.321 --> 1:19:18.388
People are watching
my every move.

1:19:18.423 --> 1:19:20.423
Oh, come on, Ronald!

1:19:20.458 --> 1:19:24.163
You could have found a way
to let me know you sold
two of my paintings!

1:19:26.431 --> 1:19:28.596
-Oops.
-What on earth is...

1:19:29.698 --> 1:19:31.401
Mr. Locke.

1:19:32.305 --> 1:19:34.404
Fletch?
Hi.

1:19:34.439 --> 1:19:36.010
What are you doing here?

1:19:36.045 --> 1:19:38.441
You know, I was worried.
I'm a-- I'm a worrier.

1:19:38.476 --> 1:19:41.444
You don't need to worry.
The paintings are here.

1:19:41.479 --> 1:19:42.610
We can save Menti.

1:19:42.645 --> 1:19:44.414
Come on. You're like a wet dog.

1:19:45.780 --> 1:19:47.483
Stupid shoes.

1:19:47.518 --> 1:19:49.287
<i> Ronald was my professor</i>
<i>in Harvard.</i>

1:19:49.927 --> 1:19:51.190
He was also my lover.

1:19:53.194 --> 1:19:54.930
Okay. You know what?
Don't look so proud.

1:19:54.965 --> 1:19:56.998
She doesn't have the best record
at picking guys.

1:19:57.033 --> 1:20:00.166
So, you stole the paintings
and gave them to him to sell?

1:20:00.201 --> 1:20:01.233
They're rightfully mine.

1:20:01.972 --> 1:20:03.400
But before I met you,

1:20:03.435 --> 1:20:05.468
Ronald stopped returning
my calls or my emails.

1:20:05.503 --> 1:20:08.471
So I was surprised
when you told me
he had sold two paintings.

1:20:08.506 --> 1:20:10.803
I always intended
to keep my bargain with you.

1:20:10.838 --> 1:20:13.949
I was just very concerned
that I was being surveilled.

1:20:13.984 --> 1:20:16.050
I'll take your word for it,
Ronald.

1:20:16.085 --> 1:20:17.678
I did a little digging,
you know.

1:20:17.713 --> 1:20:20.021
It would appear that
your father's art collection

1:20:20.056 --> 1:20:22.584
was all looted
during World War Two.

1:20:22.619 --> 1:20:25.323
If they belong to anyone,
it's probably
the Italian Republic.

1:20:25.358 --> 1:20:27.721
Okay, wait.
Was Owen Tasserly in your class?

1:20:27.756 --> 1:20:29.624
Yes.
We were both in Ronald's class.

1:20:29.659 --> 1:20:31.197
Why does that matter?

1:20:31.232 --> 1:20:34.002
What is your obsession
with Owen Tasserly?

1:20:34.037 --> 1:20:36.972
You lied to me about Tasserly,
and I think I know why.

1:20:37.007 --> 1:20:39.909
-What are you talking about?
-Owen goes to Europe
all the time.

1:20:39.944 --> 1:20:42.978
So he clearly helped you
steal the paintings
from your father's villa.

1:20:43.013 --> 1:20:45.607
Then Laurel Goodwin found out
and he killed her.

1:20:45.642 --> 1:20:47.477
But instead of turning
Tasserly in for that,

1:20:47.512 --> 1:20:49.644
you decided to let me
take the fall.

1:20:49.679 --> 1:20:52.218
Because all you care about
is your paintings.

1:20:52.253 --> 1:20:54.957
There's video of Owen and Laurel
on the night of the murder.

1:20:54.992 --> 1:20:57.223
The cops thought it was me
because of my Lakers hat.

1:20:57.258 --> 1:20:59.126
You're the only one that knows
about my Lakers hat.

1:20:59.161 --> 1:21:03.262
So you are an accessory
to murder and a liar, Andy!

1:21:03.297 --> 1:21:06.166
And a cold-hearted snake.

1:21:06.201 --> 1:21:07.563
What?

1:21:08.401 --> 1:21:09.862
Okay.

1:21:11.536 --> 1:21:14.702
Uh... Okay, I was wrong.

1:21:14.737 --> 1:21:18.244
-Um, you're not the bad guy.
He's the bad guy.

1:21:18.279 --> 1:21:20.741
Shit. Can I take this back?
Can I take any of that back?

1:21:20.776 --> 1:21:21.709
Put these on.

1:21:21.744 --> 1:21:22.710
I--
Okay. Can you--

1:21:22.745 --> 1:21:24.547
One second.

1:21:24.582 --> 1:21:26.549
Okay, I'm very sorry.
Uh, I was wrong.

1:21:26.584 --> 1:21:28.914
And-- But you have to admit
it was a pretty good theory.

1:21:28.949 --> 1:21:30.883
-I just missed a couple of--
-Shut up!

1:21:31.556 --> 1:21:33.127
Really!

1:21:34.361 --> 1:21:37.329
Ronald, what are you doing?

1:21:37.364 --> 1:21:39.925
I was in a bad spot.

1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:42.598
You shouldn't have sent Fletch
to shake the tree.

1:21:43.403 --> 1:21:44.600
Why did you kill Laurel Goodwin?

1:21:44.635 --> 1:21:46.833
I researched you, Fletch.

1:21:46.868 --> 1:21:49.209
You're a decent
investigative reporter.

1:21:49.244 --> 1:21:52.080
I couldn't run the risk
of you nosing around
in my business.

1:21:52.115 --> 1:21:54.082
I needed you out of the picture.

1:21:54.942 --> 1:21:56.381
I guess I'm flattered.

1:21:56.416 --> 1:21:58.416
Inspector Monroe
came to see me today.

1:21:58.451 --> 1:22:01.386
That's when I decided
I had to leave the country
with the paintings

1:22:01.421 --> 1:22:03.421
and tie up the loose ends.

1:22:04.391 --> 1:22:05.720
How did you know
about my Lakers hat?

1:22:05.755 --> 1:22:08.822
Mmm. Murderers get to keep
some secrets.

1:22:10.232 --> 1:22:13.926
Now, put on the handcuffs.

1:22:13.961 --> 1:22:17.303
You weren't planning
to take us out to sea
and tie us up together

1:22:17.338 --> 1:22:18.898
and push us overboard, were you?

1:22:18.933 --> 1:22:20.570
I was already prepared
to commit one murder tonight.

1:22:20.605 --> 1:22:22.011
What makes you think
I won't commit two?

1:22:22.772 --> 1:22:24.211
Oops.

1:22:24.246 --> 1:22:25.806
Ronald, stop this bullshit!

1:22:25.841 --> 1:22:27.610
Yeah!

1:22:27.645 --> 1:22:29.810
Shh, shh, shh.
You raise your voice again,

1:22:29.845 --> 1:22:31.746
I'll just put on
some very loud music.

1:22:31.781 --> 1:22:34.617
Can I pick it, please?
'Cause the EDM...
Just anything else.

1:22:34.652 --> 1:22:36.751
Dixieland, jazz...
...bluegrass.

1:22:36.786 --> 1:22:38.126
Put on the handcuffs, asshole.

1:22:38.161 --> 1:22:39.490
You're sick!

1:22:39.525 --> 1:22:41.228
He hasn't had a cold
in over 20 years.

1:22:41.263 --> 1:22:42.955
-I should shoot you now.
-Ronnie!

1:22:42.990 --> 1:22:44.330
-Help!
-Help! He's got a gun!

1:22:44.365 --> 1:22:45.925
playing on speakers]

1:22:45.960 --> 1:22:48.763
Ronnie!
What the hell are you doing
down there?

1:22:48.798 --> 1:22:50.303
-Ah!

1:22:55.343 --> 1:22:57.442
Oh, no!

1:23:17.629 --> 1:23:18.661
Hi, Fletch.

1:23:19.829 --> 1:23:20.861
Uh, hi.

1:23:23.899 --> 1:23:29.034
Uh, so, the Scotch
should be a fine single malt.

1:23:29.069 --> 1:23:31.839
Again, it's a hospital,
but we'll see what we can do.

1:23:31.874 --> 1:23:33.280
What about beer?

1:23:34.382 --> 1:23:36.052
Edibles make me gassy.

1:23:37.352 --> 1:23:38.549
Horan's boat is
that big green...

1:23:38.584 --> 1:23:40.188
Turned into a pretty nice night.

1:23:41.752 --> 1:23:42.850
From a weather standpoint.

1:23:44.722 --> 1:23:46.458
Sorry. No paintings.

1:23:46.493 --> 1:23:48.493
What? No, no, no. That can't be.

1:23:48.528 --> 1:23:50.055
We checked everywhere.

1:23:50.090 --> 1:23:51.826
We cut open the mattresses,
ripped out the paneling.

1:23:51.861 --> 1:23:53.498
There are no paintings
on that boat.

1:23:53.533 --> 1:23:54.862
That is impossible.

1:23:54.897 --> 1:23:57.029
Wait.
Uh, how did you find me here?

1:23:57.064 --> 1:23:59.768
Well, when there was
the incident here last night,

1:23:59.803 --> 1:24:01.935
I put together
that Horan owned the boat

1:24:01.970 --> 1:24:05.180
and that we found you
parked in front of his gallery.

1:24:05.215 --> 1:24:07.215
Well, I put that together.

1:24:07.250 --> 1:24:09.250
Well, yes, I--
I know that, Griz,

1:24:09.285 --> 1:24:13.386
but when I say I, I mean--
Griz-- Griz put that together.

1:24:13.421 --> 1:24:15.322
So I went to see Horan

1:24:15.357 --> 1:24:17.720
and there was something
about him that just
made me suspicious.

1:24:17.755 --> 1:24:21.196
So we did some digging
and found out
that he was heavily in debt

1:24:21.231 --> 1:24:24.364
and being investigated
for a false insurance claim.

1:24:24.399 --> 1:24:26.300
-Mmm.
-Mm-hmm. I also found that.

1:24:26.335 --> 1:24:29.028
Griz put that together.
Just saying.

1:24:29.063 --> 1:24:30.469
And that's when it hit me.

1:24:32.132 --> 1:24:33.406
Us.
Us.

1:24:33.441 --> 1:24:35.573
Horan killed Laurel Goodwin.

1:24:36.543 --> 1:24:38.070
Went to go arrest him.
He wasn't there.

1:24:38.105 --> 1:24:40.281
And we had a hunch
that he might be here.

1:24:41.614 --> 1:24:43.416
How did you connect him
to Laurel's murder?

1:24:43.451 --> 1:24:45.715
He's always sanitizing
his hands.
Mmm.

1:24:45.750 --> 1:24:50.423
He had the cups
for the ink pens,
clean and dirty.

1:24:50.458 --> 1:24:52.117
Germophobe.
Germophobe.

1:24:52.152 --> 1:24:54.053
So take a look at this
right here.
Look at this video.

1:24:54.088 --> 1:24:55.131
Look at the very end.

1:25:01.469 --> 1:25:04.503
-Oh, look there.
-Uh, what? I don't s--

1:25:04.538 --> 1:25:07.099
He jerks his hand back
because she touches
his bare skin.

1:25:08.278 --> 1:25:09.508
Germaphobe.
Germaphobe.

1:25:09.543 --> 1:25:12.071
But that man has black hair.

1:25:12.106 --> 1:25:14.106
Found this cheap black hair dye.

1:25:14.141 --> 1:25:17.879
So, how did he know
who I really was?
That I wear a Lakers hat?

1:25:17.914 --> 1:25:21.190
Do you remember a picture of you
from an article
from<i> La Republica?</i>

1:25:22.457 --> 1:25:23.489
Sure.

1:25:25.361 --> 1:25:26.855
Oh...

1:25:27.957 --> 1:25:29.561
-I was wearing my lucky hat.
-Mm-hmm.

1:25:29.596 --> 1:25:32.333
And I Zoomed with Horan.
Wow, I am an idiot.

1:25:32.368 --> 1:25:34.599
Thank you.
Yup. Finally, a consensus.

1:25:34.634 --> 1:25:37.569
Okay, but why Laurel Goodwin?
Why her?

1:25:37.604 --> 1:25:40.770
Laurel Goodwin was auditing
Horan's class at Harvard.

1:25:40.805 --> 1:25:45.247
Horan had installed some art
in Tasserly's townhouse.
So, he had a key.

1:25:45.282 --> 1:25:47.843
He feigned interest
in Miss Goodwin's career
to lure her there.

1:25:47.878 --> 1:25:50.252
She was just
a convenient victim.

1:25:50.287 --> 1:25:52.815
He wanted to frame Fletch.
Oh, God. Poor woman.

1:25:53.686 --> 1:25:54.883
That bastard!

1:25:57.624 --> 1:25:59.657
He was going to kill me, too.

1:26:03.531 --> 1:26:05.531
I'm gonna head back
to the station.
Yup.

1:26:07.733 --> 1:26:11.471
Well, let me just say
I'm glad that we finally
solved this case.

1:26:14.201 --> 1:26:15.871
Together.

1:26:16.478 --> 1:26:18.038
We?
We.

1:26:18.678 --> 1:26:19.776
We three.

1:26:20.746 --> 1:26:22.009
No.

1:26:22.044 --> 1:26:25.815
-Mmm.
-We solved the case.

1:26:25.850 --> 1:26:27.883
Well, we.
No, no, no, no.

1:26:27.918 --> 1:26:30.215
You came barefoot into my office

1:26:30.250 --> 1:26:33.625
and woke up my child
with a list of suspects
that Horan wasn't even on!

1:26:33.660 --> 1:26:36.122
-I don't know about that.
-You got your ass kicked
on the boat

1:26:36.157 --> 1:26:38.399
and almost got shot in the face.
That's what you did.

1:26:39.699 --> 1:26:41.402
I'm gonna go to the car.

1:26:42.196 --> 1:26:43.998
I'm gonna miss us.

1:26:44.033 --> 1:26:46.506
But you know,
only you could have snuck in
a place like this

1:26:46.541 --> 1:26:48.134
and been able to just blend in.

1:26:49.170 --> 1:26:51.038
They'd never let me in
a place like this.

1:26:51.645 --> 1:26:52.710
And I'm an inspector.

1:26:52.745 --> 1:26:54.481
Yeah, I know.

1:26:55.451 --> 1:26:56.516
'Cause you're Jewish.

1:26:57.354 --> 1:26:58.386
It's not right.

1:26:59.884 --> 1:27:00.916
<i>L'chaim.</i>

1:27:03.921 --> 1:27:06.119
Okay, Andy, why didn't you just
come clean with me?

1:27:06.154 --> 1:27:09.529
This all would have gone
so much easier had I known
the whole story.

1:27:11.093 --> 1:27:13.368
I couldn't trust you
with all the information.

1:27:13.403 --> 1:27:14.435
Why?

1:27:14.470 --> 1:27:16.404
Because, like you said...

1:27:17.770 --> 1:27:19.099
you're an idiot.

1:27:19.134 --> 1:27:20.771
So you were just using me
this whole time?

1:27:20.806 --> 1:27:22.311
No, Fletch.

1:27:22.346 --> 1:27:25.908
It's just that I fall in love
with idiots.

1:27:25.943 --> 1:27:28.812
I may be an idiot,
but I saved your life.

1:27:29.485 --> 1:27:31.045
You didn't.

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:33.487
That girl,
she saved both of our lives.

1:27:33.522 --> 1:27:34.950
Well--
What was her name?

1:27:36.151 --> 1:27:37.590
Grizzly.

1:27:37.625 --> 1:27:40.219
Actually, you know what?
I never did get her...

1:27:40.254 --> 1:27:41.627
Hold on one second.

1:27:44.929 --> 1:27:46.731
Oh, this is fun song.

1:27:47.327 --> 1:27:49.063
Griz, one last thing.

1:27:49.098 --> 1:27:52.000
I never got your real name.
I-- I gotta know.

1:27:53.443 --> 1:27:56.235
It's Griselda.
And I'm not ashamed
of my name, Fletch.

1:27:56.270 --> 1:27:57.841
You shouldn't be ashamed
of yours either.

1:27:57.876 --> 1:27:59.579
Thanks.

1:27:59.614 --> 1:28:01.240
There's a lot of other things
you could be ashamed of.

1:28:01.275 --> 1:28:03.748
Like your arrogance,
your white privilege, your feet.

1:28:03.783 --> 1:28:07.422
Okay, well, um, thank you
for saving my ass, Griselda.

1:28:07.457 --> 1:28:08.918
-Mmm.
-And if I could just say--

1:28:08.953 --> 1:28:10.359
Hands off the car, Fletch.

1:28:27.510 --> 1:28:28.872
<i> The fuck do you want?</i>

1:28:28.907 --> 1:28:30.170
Hi, Frank.

1:28:30.205 --> 1:28:31.941
You still want that exclusive?

1:28:57.265 --> 1:28:58.836
Menti, how are you, my friend?

1:28:58.871 --> 1:29:00.233
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Fletch.

1:29:01.742 --> 1:29:03.038
How were the Canary Islands?

1:29:03.073 --> 1:29:06.140
Ah. You arranged everything
splendidly.

1:29:06.175 --> 1:29:08.076
Hmm.

1:29:08.111 --> 1:29:11.981
Well, it turns out...
...the Countess
actually loves you.

1:29:12.016 --> 1:29:13.884
She was even able
to forgive Angela.

1:29:13.919 --> 1:29:16.458
-She's a remarkable woman.
-That she is.

1:29:16.493 --> 1:29:19.659
And in Angela's defense,
she didn't know
about the murder.

1:29:19.694 --> 1:29:22.794
I think she stole the paintings
so the Countess
couldn't have them.

1:29:22.829 --> 1:29:24.763
I think she resents
sharing your love.

1:29:24.798 --> 1:29:26.358
Where are the ladies now?

1:29:26.393 --> 1:29:28.063
They are spending your money.

1:29:28.098 --> 1:29:30.395
-Ha!

1:29:30.430 --> 1:29:34.366
So I have your paintings
in a van in a garage
very near here.

1:29:34.401 --> 1:29:37.105
I had a thought.
Why don't you keep them?

1:29:38.438 --> 1:29:40.042
You can't be serious.

1:29:40.077 --> 1:29:42.880
It is better for my family
if the paintings stay away.

1:29:42.915 --> 1:29:45.014
Are you absolutely sure
about that?

1:29:45.049 --> 1:29:49.920
The paintings are worth
roughly... a shitload.

1:29:51.187 --> 1:29:53.759
They were stolen by the<i> fascisti</i>
in the first place.

1:29:53.794 --> 1:29:55.959
They always made me feel guilty.

1:29:57.061 --> 1:29:59.897
<i>-Grazie.</i>
<i>-Grazie</i> right back to you.

1:30:00.867 --> 1:30:02.702
Angela is my daughter.

1:30:02.737 --> 1:30:05.034
I can forgive her.
Can you?

1:30:05.069 --> 1:30:09.071
Well, I would have,
but she, uh, dumped me.

1:30:10.140 --> 1:30:12.712
She dumped you.

1:30:12.747 --> 1:30:14.780
Maybe someday
I will understand...

1:30:14.815 --> 1:30:16.441
...the sex from behind.

1:30:16.476 --> 1:30:17.981
<i>-Che cosa?</i>

1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:21.754
My Italian is very good.

1:30:21.789 --> 1:30:22.953
-Ah.

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:28.255
<i>-Mio dio!</i>
-Papa?

1:30:28.290 --> 1:30:29.762
<i>Sei un visione?</i>

1:30:29.797 --> 1:30:31.423
I'm not a ghost, my darling.

1:30:31.458 --> 1:30:32.798
Papa!
Ang.

1:30:34.494 --> 1:30:35.900
I'm fine. I am fine.

1:30:35.935 --> 1:30:37.770
I-- I have a confession
for you both.

1:30:39.334 --> 1:30:41.037
We make believe my kidnapping,

1:30:41.072 --> 1:30:42.467
-so that we--
-Why you do that?

1:30:42.502 --> 1:30:44.579
To discover
who take the paintings.

1:30:44.614 --> 1:30:46.405
-Oh.
-We decide
it's best to...

1:30:53.018 --> 1:30:55.150
Slo Mo Monroe.

1:30:57.825 --> 1:30:59.154
Don't you have any other cases?

1:30:59.189 --> 1:31:01.794
-No, I solved them all.
-Yeah? Mazel.

1:31:01.829 --> 1:31:03.389
Oh, I got something
for your son.

1:31:03.424 --> 1:31:04.797
I was gonna send it
to your office.

1:31:05.998 --> 1:31:07.129
Huh.

1:31:10.574 --> 1:31:12.970
I mean, is that adorable?

1:31:13.775 --> 1:31:15.467
My wife will love it.

1:31:15.502 --> 1:31:16.776
Did you find the paintings yet?

1:31:16.811 --> 1:31:18.745
No, but city and highway cops

1:31:18.780 --> 1:31:22.111
are on the lookout
for a '98 turquoise
Ford Econoline van.

1:31:22.883 --> 1:31:25.345
Plates Victor-Gary-2-7-0-Sam.

1:31:25.380 --> 1:31:27.985
Apparently registered
to an I. M. Fletcher.

1:31:28.020 --> 1:31:30.592
I gave that van away, so...

1:31:30.627 --> 1:31:32.319
So you're telling me
if we stop that van,

1:31:32.354 --> 1:31:34.321
we're not gonna find
the Count's stolen paintings?

1:31:34.356 --> 1:31:36.290
You are one relentless guy,
Morris.

1:31:36.325 --> 1:31:37.896
You would have made
a good reporter.

1:31:37.931 --> 1:31:40.635
Mm-mmm, no.
I don't know
who people hate more.

1:31:40.670 --> 1:31:42.835
Cops or reporters.

1:31:44.366 --> 1:31:45.673
It's cops.

1:31:47.435 --> 1:31:49.138
Bye.

1:31:49.173 --> 1:31:51.272
<i>Enterprise Exotic Car Rental.</i>

1:31:51.307 --> 1:31:53.846
<i> Hi. Yeah.</i>
<i>Listen, uh, I had</i>
<i>a family emergency come up</i>

1:31:53.881 --> 1:31:55.881
<i>and I can't return the car</i>
<i>in person.</i>

1:31:55.916 --> 1:31:58.950
<i>So I parked it in an alleyway</i>
<i>right off of Utica there</i>

1:31:58.985 --> 1:32:01.315
and, uh, you wouldn't
believe it, somebody stole
the license plates.

1:32:01.350 --> 1:32:02.547
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

1:32:02.582 --> 1:32:04.824
So someone can just
pick that up.

1:32:04.859 --> 1:32:06.892
<i> Well, sir,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to file</i>
<i>a police report.</i>

1:32:06.927 --> 1:32:09.455
Yeah. I'm sorry.
You're breaking--
You're breaking up there.

1:32:28.949 --> 1:32:32.379
Menti.

1:32:32.414 --> 1:32:34.821
-Countess de Grassi.
<i>-Si?</i>

1:32:34.856 --> 1:32:37.318
This came for you.

1:32:37.793 --> 1:32:39.826
Only one?

1:32:39.861 --> 1:32:44.094
Fletch.
You're a piece of shit.

1:32:48.562 --> 1:32:50.738
I-- I think that's, uh, Munch.

1:32:52.874 --> 1:32:54.302
No way this shit's real.

1:33:14.764 --> 1:33:16.489

You're welcome.

-None of your business.

1:33:59.171 --> 1:34:00.808
<i> I need you for a story.</i>

There's a shit show going on

Old man March

1:34:05.144 --> 1:34:06.979

Let me just stop you

I am still officially retired

1:34:13.482 --> 1:34:15.680
and there's no amount of money
that could change my mind.

1:34:15.715 --> 1:34:18.485
Well, that's perfect,
because this pays
roughly no amount of money.

1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:20.960
Come on, Fletch.
Aren't you bored?

1:34:20.995 --> 1:34:22.962
Not yet. Bye-bye.

1:34:22.997 --> 1:34:24.590
<i> Wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

1:34:24.625 --> 1:34:26.427
Oh, and that
ugly fucking painting,

1:34:26.462 --> 1:34:28.363
have it appraised
before you throw it away.

1:34:28.398 --> 1:34:29.595
