00:30.234 --> 00:32.326
- Good morning.
- I wouldn't go that far.

00:32.534 --> 00:34.502
You can't be crabby.
You were off yesterday.

00:34.703 --> 00:38.160
- Morgenstern called about Vennerbeck.
- That MI that crumped?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.464
Kayson claims I presented
the case incompetently.

00:40.673 --> 00:43.266
Morgenstern wants me
in his office in an hour.

00:43.475 --> 00:44.839
I wanna throw up.

00:45.043 --> 00:48.807
Kayson's just trying to cover his ass.
Morgenstern knows that.

00:49.346 --> 00:52.007
Maybe I'll get lucky
and Kayson'll fall in front...

00:52.214 --> 00:54.306
lx-nay on the Ayson-kay.

00:55.048 --> 00:57.142
- Good morning, Dr. Greene.
- Morning.

01:06.624 --> 01:08.249
- You seen Carter?
- Took a DB to 4.

01:08.458 --> 01:11.449
- Pathology's backed up.
- Yeah, what else is new?

01:17.363 --> 01:19.297
Oh, sorry! Excuse me.

01:19.965 --> 01:21.022
Dr. Benton?

01:22.267 --> 01:23.255
Carter.

01:23.701 --> 01:24.689
Carter!

01:25.234 --> 01:26.394
What are you doing?

01:26.603 --> 01:28.432
- Sleeping.
- Sleep when I tell you.

01:28.638 --> 01:31.503
Get up. I got a new student
for you to break in.

01:32.907 --> 01:33.896
Come here.

01:34.808 --> 01:35.796
- What's your name?
- Deb.

01:36.009 --> 01:39.374
This is Carter, he'll show you around.
She's all yours.

01:39.577 --> 01:43.012
- Dr. Benton, you're not going...
- Yes, I am. And no, you can't.

01:43.213 --> 01:45.237
I've got wall-to-wall surgeries.

01:45.447 --> 01:47.881
The last thing I need
is to babysit you.

01:51.218 --> 01:52.809
Is he really dead?

01:53.120 --> 01:56.088
Five bucks gets you
Super Lotto and Insta-pick.

01:56.288 --> 01:57.720
- Timmy?
- Pass.

01:57.922 --> 01:59.083
- Carol?
- Oh, why not?

01:59.290 --> 02:01.416
Morning, gang.
Timmy, what do we got?

02:01.624 --> 02:04.854
Our specials for today are:
Suicidal junkie in 4.

02:05.060 --> 02:06.856
- Going once...
- I'll take it.

02:07.061 --> 02:09.154
I could use a little cheering up.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.262
Hamster vs. Finger
in the Suture Room.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.453
Ross took it.

02:12.665 --> 02:16.259
HIV-positive kid with a busted tooth
in one. Lots of blood.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.831
What's an LL owie?

02:18.035 --> 02:20.503
Scissors in the left leg.
A medical term.

02:20.703 --> 02:23.034
- Ubaldo's back, stinky as ever.
- Oh, man!

02:23.238 --> 02:25.171
He's drunk, possible seizure.

02:25.372 --> 02:26.771
Double-glove time.

02:30.209 --> 02:31.609
So is this the perp?

02:31.810 --> 02:33.902
His name is Royden B.

02:34.111 --> 02:36.169
I thought you'd want to
check him for rabies.

02:36.379 --> 02:39.313
The only way that Royden B.
Could have rabies...

02:39.515 --> 02:41.642
...is if he's been bitten
by a wild animal.

02:41.850 --> 02:44.282
Given his lifestyle,
that's unlikely.

02:44.484 --> 02:47.885
That finger's infected, probably
because Lucy's been sucking on it.

02:48.087 --> 02:51.852
We'll clean it, give her antibiotics,
and your daughter'll be fine.

02:52.023 --> 02:53.047
Niece.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.479
Niece, sorry.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.188
There was a family resemblance.

02:57.793 --> 02:59.783
You go to the Fifth Street Gym?

03:00.329 --> 03:01.727
No. I've never been.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.120
My mistake...

03:04.497 --> 03:06.555
...but you work out.
I can tell.

03:07.433 --> 03:08.422
Excuse me.

03:09.634 --> 03:13.262
Well, you know, I play a little
basketball now and then.

03:13.470 --> 03:15.959
- Bulls fan?
- Yeah. I'm a Bulls fan.

03:16.172 --> 03:19.436
I have a friend who can
get tickets. Courtside.

03:19.740 --> 03:21.765
That is, if you're interested.

03:25.143 --> 03:27.872
I have tickets, so maybe
I'll see you there.

03:36.751 --> 03:38.013
Care for a drink?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.412
After you.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.786
- You get away for the weekend?
- Yeah.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.821
Tag and I rented a cottage
in Door County on the lake.

03:46.024 --> 03:48.490
- Went ice fishing.
- That was the highlight?

03:48.692 --> 03:50.454
The one I can tell you about.

03:51.526 --> 03:52.925
Have you set a date yet?

03:53.161 --> 03:56.721
Why does everyone keep asking that?
What's the big rush?

03:56.931 --> 03:57.920
Sorry I asked.

03:58.131 --> 04:01.691
It's just, I feel like I'd
finally gotten my life in order...

04:01.900 --> 04:03.764
...and now it's all shaken up again.

04:03.935 --> 04:05.095
You having doubts?

04:05.303 --> 04:07.167
Well, it's a big step.

04:07.504 --> 04:09.834
It's natural to have
some doubts, right?

04:10.039 --> 04:11.801
Maybe it's the forever part.

04:12.008 --> 04:14.634
It's like infinity,
it's hard to get a handle...

04:15.342 --> 04:16.331
What?

05:16.781 --> 05:17.838
Bye-bye.

05:19.316 --> 05:21.216
That was more than an
invitation to basketball.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.248
I know. I've been invited
to basketball games.

05:23.452 --> 05:25.646
- So what?
- So I want an explanation.

05:25.852 --> 05:27.081
Mark, grow up.

05:27.288 --> 05:29.380
Does this mean you
and Linda are serious?

05:29.588 --> 05:32.579
Serious? Our longest phone
conversation is "Get over here."

05:32.791 --> 05:34.951
Yeah. So what happened in there?

05:35.160 --> 05:38.322
- I've been summoned.
- Don't worry. It'll be fine.

05:38.528 --> 05:42.087
I'm just curious how you can
turn down guaranteed sex...

05:42.297 --> 05:44.321
...with an undeniably
attractive woman.

05:44.532 --> 05:47.864
If that's all there is,
I'd rather play tennis.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.728
This is very disappointing
coming from you.

05:51.470 --> 05:54.096
Nine times I've been stuck.
Never even caught the flu.

05:54.304 --> 05:56.863
- I've been lucky so far.
- This makes 5 for me.

05:57.073 --> 06:00.337
Isn't the chance of getting HIV
from a needle-stick 1 in 100?

06:00.542 --> 06:02.771
One out of 250
if the patient's infected.

06:02.976 --> 06:06.570
When Ubaldo wakes up, I'll try and
consent him so we can test him.

06:06.779 --> 06:09.405
- I'll get his T cell count regardless.
- Thanks, Lydia.

06:09.614 --> 06:11.103
It says here to be safe...

06:11.315 --> 06:14.545
...you shouldn't have unprotected sex
until after the follow-up...

06:14.751 --> 06:16.377
...in six months.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.347
Thanks, Wendy.

06:23.522 --> 06:24.614
I'm Dr. Greene.

06:24.825 --> 06:27.417
- Serena, U.S. Customs.
- We're going this way.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.991
- What's the problem?
- Picked him up at O'Hare.

06:30.194 --> 06:34.652
He's a body packer. He's got cocaine
in his belly wrapped in condoms.

06:34.863 --> 06:36.626
Here, sit right here.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.197
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.991
He doesn't speak English.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.929
He's been retaining the
evidence for 8 days.

06:44.136 --> 06:47.069
Eight days? Sounds like one for
the Guinness Book of Records.

06:47.271 --> 06:49.670
Can't blame him for trying.
He's facing 20 years.

06:49.873 --> 06:51.931
No obvious signs of toxicity.

06:52.141 --> 06:53.869
The condoms must still be intact.

06:54.075 --> 06:56.509
If you can give him a laxative,
it'd make my job easier.

06:56.710 --> 06:59.769
I can't give him any medication
without his consent.

06:59.979 --> 07:02.470
Borrow a pen?
We'll work him up, x-ray him...

07:02.681 --> 07:06.639
...hope that nature takes its course
before a condom breaks.

07:21.593 --> 07:23.287
Where'd you learn Spanish?

07:23.494 --> 07:24.586
Here.

07:25.528 --> 07:28.224
We work Benton's hours,
sleep when he sleeps. Never.

07:28.430 --> 07:30.489
We've been on call since yesterday.

07:30.698 --> 07:34.156
This is an IV cart. Most patients
get an IV when they come in.

07:34.367 --> 07:37.563
Angiocath 16 needle if they're
bleeding. You can start an IV?

07:37.770 --> 07:40.636
- Yeah. Actually, no.
- I thought you were third year.

07:40.838 --> 07:45.206
A body packer in four. Work him up.
KUB, drug screen, urinalysis.

07:45.408 --> 07:46.840
Ever do a urinalysis?

07:47.042 --> 07:48.838
Carter, do a rectal.

07:49.043 --> 07:50.942
This is your lucky day.

08:00.184 --> 08:02.048
- What do we got?
- Respiratory distress.

08:02.253 --> 08:05.345
- He crashed.
- From bradycardic at 35 to flatline.

08:05.554 --> 08:07.077
Temp's 104.
Blood cultures sent.

08:07.289 --> 08:10.188
Septic shock. Give him
an amp of epi, a mig of atropine...

08:10.391 --> 08:13.119
...1.5 of each Erythro and cefotaxime.

08:13.325 --> 08:15.087
- What's going on?
- You his father?

08:15.293 --> 08:17.557
- Yes.
- We're stimulating his heart.

08:17.762 --> 08:19.524
Epi and atropine on board.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.720
- Any heart sounds?
- Negative.

08:21.931 --> 08:24.455
Piggyback an Isuprel drip.
This ever happen before?

08:24.666 --> 08:26.326
Once, when he had pneumonia.

08:26.534 --> 08:28.126
- Cerebral palsy?
- Brain damage.

08:28.334 --> 08:30.928
- Got a pulse.
- All right, heart's back.

08:37.274 --> 08:39.003
- He's in V-tach.
- What the hell?

08:39.208 --> 08:42.370
Hold the Isuprel now,
and give him lidocaine.

08:42.577 --> 08:44.135
Fifty milligrams, IV push.

08:44.345 --> 08:46.607
- What's happening?
- His heart is racing.

08:46.779 --> 08:47.768
- Why?
- I don't know.

08:47.981 --> 08:51.039
Let's get the 12-lead in there
and see what's going on.

08:51.249 --> 08:52.510
Move that.

08:52.716 --> 08:55.412
Move it. Draw petrillian.

08:57.853 --> 09:00.083
I told Kayson this kind of
finger-pointing...

09:00.289 --> 09:03.723
...runs contrary to the spirit
of a teaching hospital.

09:03.924 --> 09:06.324
- Juice?
- No, thank you.

09:06.859 --> 09:10.658
He failed to see my point.
He's bringing disciplinary charges.

09:10.862 --> 09:13.125
What does that mean, exactly?

09:13.397 --> 09:15.990
You'll come before the committee,
defend yourself.

09:16.198 --> 09:19.291
We'll make a determination
and take steps accordingly.

09:19.501 --> 09:23.368
Dr. Morgenstern, I tried
to present Mr. Vennerbeck's history.

09:23.570 --> 09:25.663
Dr. Kayson cut me off
and released him.

09:25.871 --> 09:27.600
The specifics don't concern me...

09:27.806 --> 09:31.502
...nearly as much as your
inability to assert yourself.

09:31.808 --> 09:32.866
Excuse me?

09:33.076 --> 09:35.168
You allowed Kayson to intimidate you.

09:35.376 --> 09:36.571
Not the first time.

09:36.779 --> 09:40.269
I recall a similar incident with
Benton about an appendix.

09:40.481 --> 09:41.812
I was right about that.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.676
But you deferred to Benton's judgment.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.942
You lack the authority
to put forward your own opinions.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.915
To act as an aggressive
advocate for your patients.

09:52.121 --> 09:55.021
I guess I have to work on that.

09:55.224 --> 09:56.622
Yes, you do.

10:02.261 --> 10:03.522
Confidence.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.295
Composure under pressure.
Assertiveness.

10:06.497 --> 10:10.398
These are the requisite qualities
of a good ER specialist.

10:11.666 --> 10:13.929
I'll give you the chance
to develop them.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.101
If you don't, we'll have
a discussion...

10:16.303 --> 10:19.862
...about which specialty
might best match your temperament.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.440
Peaked T waves, unstable rhythm.
Gotta be potassium, right?

10:26.643 --> 10:27.973
- His lytes back?
- Not yet.

10:28.177 --> 10:30.770
Can't wait. Give him
calcium gluconate 15 mils.

10:30.979 --> 10:33.105
- It could kill him.
- Just do it.

10:33.313 --> 10:36.281
- Asystole.
- All right, repeat epi and atropine.

10:36.483 --> 10:39.575
- Doctor?
- Your son's potassium is too high.

10:39.784 --> 10:42.343
Probably from renal failure.
We'll try to bring it down.

10:42.553 --> 10:44.816
I got a pulse.
Weak, but it's there.

10:45.021 --> 10:47.284
- BP 35 palp.
- I'll take it.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.714
Lytes are back.
Potassium's high, 7.5.

10:50.925 --> 10:53.893
We're on the right track.
Stand by with glucose and insulin.

10:54.094 --> 10:55.117
Is he gonna live?

10:55.528 --> 10:57.120
Looks like he'll make it.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.272
I heard you got stuck again.
What is it, number four?

11:13.473 --> 11:16.634
- Count them.
- Five. Wow! I've only got three.

11:16.841 --> 11:20.900
Put me down for emptying the sharps
containers. I need to catch up.

11:21.111 --> 11:22.543
Don't tempt the Fates.

11:22.745 --> 11:25.907
- You and Tag set a date yet?
- Not yet.

11:30.583 --> 11:31.572
How'd it go?

11:31.784 --> 11:34.308
How'd it go?
Well, it's hard to describe.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.509
Timmy, where's Petrofsky's chart?

11:36.720 --> 11:38.118
Why? What happened?

11:38.788 --> 11:42.052
If I told you right now,
I think I'd lose it.

11:44.692 --> 11:46.523
Go down to Exam Two.

11:46.726 --> 11:49.490
- You live at the Marymount Home?
- For the emotionally disabled.

11:49.695 --> 11:51.560
That's what society has labeled me.

11:51.764 --> 11:54.287
- What's open?
- Trauma. Everything else is full.

11:54.498 --> 11:56.796
When did the
shortness of breath start?

11:57.000 --> 11:59.398
A month ago.
But this week it got worse.

11:59.602 --> 12:00.829
Are you on medication?

12:01.036 --> 12:04.698
Yes. This is my medical binder.
I've kept it since I was 14.

12:04.905 --> 12:08.634
Medications are in orange.
Actually, it'd be more pumpkin.

12:08.841 --> 12:12.331
And you take lithium,
Depakote and Synthroid.

12:12.542 --> 12:14.203
Yes. I've taken these.

12:14.878 --> 12:17.402
My allergy section.
These pages are mauve.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.580
Vaccinations are gray.

12:19.881 --> 12:21.940
Doctors' names and numbers
are plum...

12:22.149 --> 12:25.117
...and past medical records
are in various shades of red...

12:25.318 --> 12:27.808
...from vermillion to puce.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.043
Very colorful.

12:29.220 --> 12:30.209
Thank you.

12:30.621 --> 12:34.283
- And you're dressed all in blue.
- Yes. It's Monday.

12:42.194 --> 12:43.492
Come on in, Alan.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.918
I can't.

12:46.130 --> 12:47.927
- Why not?
- It's green.

12:49.299 --> 12:50.561
Is that bad?

12:51.934 --> 12:53.060
Very.

13:01.908 --> 13:03.101
He asleep?

13:03.308 --> 13:05.572
Yeah. I went and got
a few of his things.

13:05.776 --> 13:08.175
Ben's pretty sick.
He's got pneumonia...

13:08.378 --> 13:10.744
...which caused his heart
problems earlier.

13:10.946 --> 13:12.469
I hope the antibiotics
will help.

13:12.681 --> 13:14.613
Last time they put him
on a ventilator.

13:14.816 --> 13:17.340
We may do that if his
blood gases don't improve.

13:17.550 --> 13:20.917
- When will you know?
- We'll check in an hour or so.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.822
He likes rhythm.

13:30.125 --> 13:33.525
Before the accident, he was
taking trumpet lessons.

13:34.428 --> 13:36.554
He used the metronome to practice.

13:37.830 --> 13:39.491
I don't think he remembers.

13:42.367 --> 13:43.993
Kid had a hell of a bat.

13:45.302 --> 13:48.758
Now if that picture isn't there
when he wakes up, he gets this look.

13:51.739 --> 13:53.536
What happened?

13:57.776 --> 14:00.073
He's on his bike,
an 85-year-old man...

14:00.277 --> 14:01.868
...waves Ben across the street...

14:02.078 --> 14:04.875
...then gets confused between
the brake and the accelerator.

14:06.515 --> 14:07.573
Look...

14:07.782 --> 14:09.113
...I got a job interview.

14:16.421 --> 14:17.615
You got kids?

14:18.789 --> 14:19.915
I have a son.

14:20.124 --> 14:22.182
- How old?
- He's eight.

14:22.692 --> 14:24.181
That's a nice age.

14:28.329 --> 14:32.786
Okay, Deb. As we say around here
quite often, "Glove up and dig in."

14:32.998 --> 14:34.863
Carter, isn't that your job?

14:35.066 --> 14:36.294
Deb's gotta learn.

14:37.401 --> 14:38.925
Exactly what do I look for?

14:39.136 --> 14:42.433
Obstructions, masses,
anything out of the ordinary.

14:42.771 --> 14:45.262
But I don't have anything
to compare it to.

14:45.472 --> 14:46.836
You will soon.

14:49.008 --> 14:52.032
Mr. Jorge, could you turn
on your side, please?

14:53.245 --> 14:54.233
Thank you.

14:56.780 --> 14:57.905
I'm sorry.

15:00.349 --> 15:01.610
Everything okay?

15:02.150 --> 15:05.346
Well, he seems a little tense.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.180
Show him who's boss.

15:09.655 --> 15:10.643
Sorry.

15:11.456 --> 15:13.116
<i>Santa Maria!</i>

15:15.825 --> 15:17.486
How's it going in there?

15:18.593 --> 15:20.423
I'm stuck.

15:21.362 --> 15:23.261
- Deb?
- Yes?

15:23.463 --> 15:25.362
Did you use any lubricant?

15:26.832 --> 15:28.857
Was I supposed to?

15:29.701 --> 15:31.167
Breathe.

15:32.469 --> 15:34.095
Fever's 101.

15:34.303 --> 15:37.203
Have your doctors told you
you have a heart murmur?

15:38.472 --> 15:40.099
I don't think so.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.070
I could check my book, though.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.741
Have you had a cough lately?

15:43.910 --> 15:44.899
Yes.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.044
Loose cough, bringing up sputum?

15:47.212 --> 15:48.200
Yes.

15:48.679 --> 15:49.907
What color?

15:51.648 --> 15:52.671
Sort of a...

15:53.049 --> 15:56.608
...sulphur yellow with saffron mixed in.
Kind of like these tiles here.

15:56.818 --> 16:00.616
But more of a yellow... These are more
yellow-beige, I suppose.

16:00.820 --> 16:02.447
Alan's into colors.

16:02.655 --> 16:03.882
I see.

16:04.123 --> 16:06.646
I want to run some tests,
do a chest x-ray.

16:06.857 --> 16:09.689
All right.
Did you have red hair as a child?

16:10.460 --> 16:13.154
I thought I saw a touch
of russet in your hair.

16:13.462 --> 16:15.554
It was probably ketchup from lunch.

16:18.364 --> 16:21.560
Zeidenberg's going to a lecture series
in Detroit next week.

16:21.767 --> 16:23.394
You want to cover for him?

16:24.001 --> 16:24.989
Sure.

16:25.202 --> 16:29.160
You have to take over the scheduling,
risk management, shift reports...

16:29.371 --> 16:33.670
No problem. It'll be good training for
when I'm chief surgical resident.

16:33.941 --> 16:37.876
That's what I like about you,
naked ambition tempered by arrogance.

16:38.077 --> 16:40.943
You have an emergency call.
Your brother-in-law.

16:41.146 --> 16:44.511
- I'm scrubbing in for surgery.
- He said your mother's missing.

16:44.715 --> 16:47.238
Go. I'll get Schneider to scrub in.

16:48.817 --> 16:51.011
Peter, go. It's your mother.

16:51.219 --> 16:54.984
Okay, I'll be back this afternoon
in time for the pheo.

16:59.524 --> 17:00.512
Hold on.

17:01.158 --> 17:05.355
Dr. Lewis, you took care of
Miss Callahan, who went up to OB, right?

17:05.594 --> 17:07.561
Dr. Bernardi, upstairs, for you.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.856
Her chart still around?

17:10.896 --> 17:12.454
This is Dr. Lewis.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.258
Yeah. We gave her...

17:16.268 --> 17:19.792
...magnesium sulfate, a six-gram bolus.

17:20.103 --> 17:22.093
Right before we sent her to you.

17:23.705 --> 17:25.194
Yeah, no problem.

17:25.406 --> 17:28.841
Hey, Timmy. Any idea why Mark
signed this chart?

17:40.449 --> 17:42.815
- Where's Greene?
- Exam Room 4.

17:47.788 --> 17:50.085
There must be at least
100 of them in there.

17:50.289 --> 17:52.279
- Are they moving along?
- Not really.

17:52.490 --> 17:56.186
- How long is this gonna take?
- You'll have to ask Jorge that.

17:56.526 --> 17:58.756
Why are you cosigning my charts?

17:59.628 --> 18:00.617
Excuse me.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.729
- My charts have your signature. Why?
- Morgenstern told me to.

18:04.932 --> 18:07.763
You think you need
to oversee my decisions?

18:07.967 --> 18:09.865
- No.
- You tell Morgenstern that?

18:10.068 --> 18:13.934
- He didn't ask my opinion.
- Why didn't you stand up for me?

18:14.138 --> 18:17.004
You seem to forget a patient died.
Your patient.

18:17.239 --> 18:19.968
It could've happened to any of us,
but it happened to you.

18:20.175 --> 18:22.665
And now there's a lawsuit
and an inquiry.

18:22.876 --> 18:25.776
And because I'm chief resident,
it's my problem too.

18:25.978 --> 18:30.437
So if Morgenstern wants me to cosign
your charts, I'm gonna do it.

18:31.382 --> 18:34.373
You knew what he was gonna
say to me today, didn't you?

18:36.718 --> 18:38.150
- Yes.
- You talked about me.

18:38.353 --> 18:41.149
I talk with Morgenstern
about every resident.

18:41.355 --> 18:44.049
- What'd you say?
- That Kayson gives you a hard time.

18:44.256 --> 18:47.247
And the way he rides you,
it's no wonder this happened.

18:47.458 --> 18:50.722
And when you go head-to-head with
guys like Benton and Kayson...

18:50.928 --> 18:52.520
...you tend to back down.

18:55.597 --> 18:57.690
Son of a bitch.

19:08.739 --> 19:10.728
Hey, Ben. How are you?

19:16.476 --> 19:17.465
I got it.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.650
Dr. Ross.

19:30.853 --> 19:32.820
Hey, Wendy, look who's up.

19:33.020 --> 19:35.352
O-2 sat's falling.
Get him on a ventilator.

19:35.555 --> 19:37.216
You better look at this.

19:41.025 --> 19:42.515
"Do not resuscitate"?

19:43.160 --> 19:44.525
His father did this?

19:59.070 --> 20:03.631
Wendy, give Mr. Menkens
350 milligrams a minute of dopamine.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.935
I think you mean micrograms.

20:06.141 --> 20:08.335
- That's what I said, isn't it?
- No.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.710
- Have Ubaldo's T cells come back?
- No. Lab's backed up.

20:16.915 --> 20:19.542
Get this little smidge
out of my face.

20:19.749 --> 20:21.877
- What's wrong with him?
- Who cares?

20:22.085 --> 20:24.746
- Carol, can you get a chart going?
- Sure.

20:24.953 --> 20:27.477
- What did you do?
- Questioned her sexual orientation.

20:27.688 --> 20:28.882
Well, that's rude.

20:29.090 --> 20:31.818
- No malice intended.
- Did she do this?

20:32.025 --> 20:34.424
- Newsstand guy.
- What'd you say to him?

20:34.626 --> 20:37.992
Derogatory comments about his heritage.
Didn't take much.

20:38.161 --> 20:41.357
- Injuries anywhere else?
- Think I've got a cracked rib.

20:41.530 --> 20:42.519
Newsstand guy?

20:42.731 --> 20:45.563
Florist in Wicker Park,
sensitive about his hairweave.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.563
Malik, give me a hand.
Take him to the Suture Room.

20:48.768 --> 20:52.703
What do you do? Go around insulting
people until they hit you?

20:53.070 --> 20:56.506
I'm a sociologist at Chicago,
specializing in violence.

20:56.706 --> 20:59.868
I select a subject, ask two questions
to probe for insecurities...

21:00.075 --> 21:03.168
...then I antagonize them
until they assault me.

21:03.378 --> 21:05.538
- Sounds dangerous.
- Tell me about it.

21:05.746 --> 21:09.407
My insurance company charges me the
same premiums as NASCAR drivers.

21:20.188 --> 21:23.986
We'll move him to Intensive Care soon.
I see you made a decision.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.882
Mr. Gaither, Ben's blood
gases are not good.

21:28.093 --> 21:29.923
He's not getting enough oxygen.

21:30.528 --> 21:32.495
If he's not ventilated,
he could die.

21:34.297 --> 21:35.286
When?

21:36.432 --> 21:38.126
It could be a matter of hours.

21:40.501 --> 21:42.093
With the proper care...

21:42.568 --> 21:44.694
...he could live a long time.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.169
Are you sure...

21:48.372 --> 21:50.101
...that you want to give up?

22:05.784 --> 22:07.512
I can't believe Mrs. Lukey.

22:07.718 --> 22:10.584
She's too senile to do the job.

22:10.787 --> 22:13.619
Myatt's kid may have seen
your mom down at the corner.

22:13.822 --> 22:17.221
- She waited two hours to call us.
- Not us. Me.

22:17.424 --> 22:20.119
- She made me look like an idiot...
- Look, Peter.

22:20.326 --> 22:22.624
I left a station full of
cars that need service.

22:22.828 --> 22:26.627
All because you had to hire some
old woman to take care of your mom...

22:26.830 --> 22:29.491
...instead of putting her in a home.
- She's not doing that.

22:29.699 --> 22:33.394
- Like hell she isn't.
- Walt, don't tell me what to do.

22:33.702 --> 22:36.533
I won't let you put us
through this anymore.

22:36.737 --> 22:39.260
I'm sorry if it makes you sad,
but there's no choice.

22:39.471 --> 22:41.268
She's my mother.
Who are you to tell me...

22:41.472 --> 22:45.805
I paid for her food, her clothes
and her care for the last six years.

22:46.009 --> 22:47.839
She lets you live in her house.

22:48.043 --> 22:51.307
Who pays the damn mortgage?
Who pays the bills?

22:51.512 --> 22:53.536
You don't get anything out of it?

22:53.747 --> 22:55.771
How many high-school
dropouts do you know...

22:55.982 --> 22:59.212
...have a $ 100,000 business
just dropped in their laps?

22:59.950 --> 23:01.417
High-school dropout?

23:02.586 --> 23:05.520
I cared for your family for six years.

23:05.787 --> 23:08.347
I carried your family for six years.

23:09.557 --> 23:13.788
I'm responsible for your mother, your
sister, the house and the station.

23:13.993 --> 23:17.792
The only one that Peter
is responsible for is Peter.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.954
I'm gonna look by the firehouse.

23:24.332 --> 23:28.062
Okay, Mr. Desmond, I'm going to
clean your abrasions.

23:28.936 --> 23:30.926
We'll start with your wrist.

23:31.137 --> 23:32.695
It may sting a little.

23:33.271 --> 23:36.103
- That's a big engagement ring.
- Isn't it?

23:36.307 --> 23:38.433
Kind of ostentatious,
don't you think?

23:38.709 --> 23:39.698
No, I don't.

23:39.909 --> 23:41.239
Can I ask you two questions?

23:41.778 --> 23:42.801
All right.

23:43.045 --> 23:44.034
Excuse me.

23:45.346 --> 23:47.575
- What does your fiancé do?
- He's a doctor.

23:47.782 --> 23:50.943
So, gonna be a doctor's wife.
When's the date?

23:51.484 --> 23:53.474
We haven't set one yet.

23:53.651 --> 23:54.639
Why not?

23:55.386 --> 23:57.115
Your two questions are up.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.481
What's the matter?
Somebody can't commit?

24:00.689 --> 24:04.249
Based on the ring, I don't think
it's him. So what is it?

24:05.126 --> 24:06.683
Think you're too good for him?

24:06.893 --> 24:11.090
Scared of spending your life with
someone who doesn't meet your standards?

24:11.397 --> 24:13.261
Got a high opinion of yourself,
don't you?

24:13.464 --> 24:17.331
"Sure, I'll marry you.
Just don't tie me down to a date."

24:17.500 --> 24:18.524
That stings!

24:18.734 --> 24:20.394
- Really?
- Yes, it does.

24:21.369 --> 24:22.427
God!

24:22.636 --> 24:25.069
Twenty-one second PAI...

24:25.272 --> 24:28.205
...puts you in the top percentile
on the hostility index.

24:28.774 --> 24:32.402
- PAI is?
- Provocation-to-assault interval.

24:33.209 --> 24:34.334
You're good.

24:35.344 --> 24:36.402
God, you're good.

24:38.846 --> 24:39.835
John, what's this?

24:40.048 --> 24:41.515
It's a laryngoscope.

24:42.015 --> 24:43.812
No, no.
Second shelf from the top.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.512
- Can you teach me how these work?
- Some other time.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.079
We need this crash cart in Four.

24:51.387 --> 24:53.616
Body packer popped a condom.

24:53.823 --> 24:55.119
Got it? Let's go.

25:00.193 --> 25:02.558
- Give me some room, huh?
- There you go.

25:03.495 --> 25:06.463
- Try not to get in the way.
- Can't you pull out the coke?

25:06.664 --> 25:08.460
We gotta stabilize him first.

25:08.665 --> 25:13.101
- He's having multifocal PVCs.
- Lidocaine 150, IV push.

25:13.501 --> 25:14.967
He's in fib. Paddles.

25:15.637 --> 25:16.762
Oh, my God!

25:19.173 --> 25:21.002
- What was that set on?
- 200.

25:21.207 --> 25:22.969
He should be okay.

25:24.708 --> 25:27.438
Thank you. Why don't you
check on him, okay?

25:27.610 --> 25:28.599
Clear.

25:29.945 --> 25:33.209
That's not good. Let's go again.
Three hundred.

25:34.615 --> 25:35.672
Clear.

25:37.551 --> 25:39.142
Normal sinus.
Take him upstairs.

25:39.351 --> 25:43.616
Notify the O.R. They got a laparotomy.
We gotta get these condoms out.

25:44.888 --> 25:47.651
Don't worry, honey.
He just bumped his head.

25:50.258 --> 25:53.818
Alan, the guy with the colors?
His films came back.

25:54.028 --> 25:56.460
Radiology had a bunch
from a few years ago too.

25:58.596 --> 25:59.621
Susan?

26:08.970 --> 26:11.062
I can stay in this room all day.

26:11.505 --> 26:13.335
It's warm, like flannel.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.004
I wish I could wear it.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.202
When you gave me your history,
you didn't say you had cancer.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.900
What's nice about this room is that...

26:22.911 --> 26:25.379
...it's not too bright.

26:27.548 --> 26:29.640
When yellow's too bright,
it's not welcoming.

26:29.850 --> 26:32.716
Alan, you have a tumor
in your chest...

26:32.952 --> 26:35.852
...encasing your heart
and infiltrating your lungs.

26:36.087 --> 26:37.554
On the other hand...

26:38.088 --> 26:41.853
...if yellow's too pale,
it feels cold and clammy.

26:42.692 --> 26:45.750
There are treatments:
Chemotherapy, radiation...

26:45.960 --> 26:48.394
Dr. Lewis and I think you
should see an oncologist.

26:48.596 --> 26:49.892
I'll tell you one thing:

26:50.162 --> 26:52.687
Whoever made this room
sure knew his yellow.

27:00.402 --> 27:01.835
Could I be alone, please?

27:02.103 --> 27:03.092
Sure.

27:27.720 --> 27:28.708
Ma?

27:30.088 --> 27:32.248
Ma, what are you doing up here?

27:32.456 --> 27:34.083
Who is that?

27:35.558 --> 27:37.718
- Peter?
- Yeah, Ma, it's me.

27:37.926 --> 27:40.485
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

27:41.162 --> 27:44.061
Ma, I work at a hospital, remember?

27:44.230 --> 27:45.219
I'm a doctor.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.127
I know that.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.799
Why do I feel I don't
get a chance to see you?

27:55.404 --> 27:57.803
Well, because they keep
us pretty busy.

27:59.006 --> 28:01.200
But we see each other sometimes.

28:01.642 --> 28:03.836
So serious.

28:05.043 --> 28:09.502
I remember you sitting
in that green chair by the window...

28:09.713 --> 28:11.179
...reading your books.

28:11.380 --> 28:13.644
So serious.

28:19.753 --> 28:21.379
You know, Ma...

28:25.355 --> 28:28.585
...with Jackie at work all day
and the kids at school...

28:29.926 --> 28:31.894
...we worry about you being alone.

28:32.460 --> 28:35.917
Oh, I don't like it that way either.
I like a full house.

28:36.130 --> 28:38.688
Well, that's why we were thinking...

28:39.398 --> 28:43.424
...maybe you'd be happier in a place
where, you know, there's...

28:44.235 --> 28:48.499
Where there's other people your age,
people that can take care of you.

28:49.305 --> 28:54.002
I used to bring Jackie
to take skating lessons right here.

28:54.575 --> 28:56.439
And your father and I...

28:56.642 --> 28:59.667
...watched you in
the Little League...

28:59.878 --> 29:01.436
...right on this field.

29:01.979 --> 29:03.070
Remember?

29:03.380 --> 29:04.607
Yeah, I remember.

29:07.883 --> 29:09.645
Your father's dead.

29:12.652 --> 29:13.641
Yeah.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.547
Yeah. He's dead, Ma.

29:19.456 --> 29:20.445
Peter...

29:26.661 --> 29:29.993
...I don't want to go
into a nursing home.

29:37.068 --> 29:38.228
All right.

29:44.339 --> 29:46.829
It's all right, Ma.
It's all right.

29:49.642 --> 29:54.010
Spin a crit, type and cross-match
4 units. Get some O-negative here.

29:54.212 --> 29:57.078
- Man, you gotta do something.
- Out of the way.

29:57.448 --> 29:58.607
Out of the way!

29:59.015 --> 30:01.380
Stay here.
We're gonna take care of her.

30:02.150 --> 30:04.583
- BP's 40 palp.
- Someone call a surgeon.

30:04.785 --> 30:06.479
I see the entrance.
Who sees the exit?

30:06.686 --> 30:08.880
- Here, on her back.
- It was a drive-by.

30:09.088 --> 30:11.817
- She was a bystander.
- Her brother's a banger.

30:12.056 --> 30:13.614
- Look at his clothes.
- What do we got?

30:13.825 --> 30:15.553
Gunshot to the chest.
Through and through.

30:15.759 --> 30:17.885
She's hyperresonant.
Tracheal shift left.

30:18.094 --> 30:20.084
- She needs a chest tube.
- I'll do it.

30:23.431 --> 30:26.420
Heart sounds funky.
Get a cardiologist down here.

30:28.501 --> 30:31.127
- Damn it. Where's this coming from?
- Pressure's crashing.

30:31.335 --> 30:33.393
- She's taching.
- Bullet tumbled into the heart.

30:33.604 --> 30:36.070
- Let's crack her, clamp the bleeder.
- Thoracotomy tray.

30:36.272 --> 30:37.432
I'll do it.

30:38.339 --> 30:39.966
- What's the problem?
- We have a bleeder.

30:40.308 --> 30:41.399
It sounded like a murmur.

30:41.608 --> 30:43.974
- Open her quick.
- Give her O-neg, wide open.

30:47.145 --> 30:50.545
Damn it! I need suction.
I can't visualize the lungs.

30:52.950 --> 30:55.178
- How about now?
- I can't see the pleura.

30:55.384 --> 30:57.113
Her cut's not deep enough.

30:57.319 --> 30:58.307
Susan?

30:59.086 --> 31:01.848
Yes, it's deep enough.
I just can't see anything.

31:02.055 --> 31:03.749
Calm down, you'll get it.

31:05.057 --> 31:06.046
She's bleeding out.

31:09.259 --> 31:12.022
- How long will you let her do this?
- More suction.

31:12.228 --> 31:13.854
- We're losing her!
- She can't do it.

31:18.399 --> 31:20.195
Damn it! I can't see!
You try.

31:22.534 --> 31:23.523
Scalpel.

31:27.003 --> 31:28.265
Okay, I'm in.

31:32.608 --> 31:35.404
I see the bleeder.
Pulmonary artery. Clamp.

31:35.677 --> 31:36.665
No, Stadinsky.

31:43.914 --> 31:45.575
Got it.
Let's get her to O.R.

31:45.783 --> 31:47.181
Good job, Dr. Greene.

31:49.752 --> 31:50.945
Okay. Let's go.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.360
We've got a possible
appendectomy in 6.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.299
See who else is on.
I'm late for a pheo.

32:26.475 --> 32:28.135
- You got his picture?
- It's there.

32:28.343 --> 32:29.832
- The metronome?
- It's there.

32:30.043 --> 32:33.443
- We can take it from here.
- It's okay. I'll take him up.

32:40.551 --> 32:42.541
I didn't know you had a son.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.977
Well, we're not exactly close.

32:45.953 --> 32:47.318
What's his name?

32:47.621 --> 32:49.747
I don't know. Never seen him.
Here we go.

32:51.123 --> 32:52.249
Watch yourself.

32:56.761 --> 32:58.853
- The DNR sticker's on there.
- Thanks.

33:25.512 --> 33:28.639
Are we doing an anterior approach
or excising laterally?

33:28.847 --> 33:33.215
Peter, there's no need to scrub in.
I asked Schneider to assist.

33:33.417 --> 33:34.906
Hey, Peter.
How's it going?

33:35.118 --> 33:37.142
Did you take the Eisenhower in?

33:37.353 --> 33:39.650
Ever notice that piano showroom
near Halsted?

33:39.854 --> 33:43.255
- I got my wife's harpsichord there.
- Wait. You've been inside?

33:43.457 --> 33:46.253
They have a Steinway collection
that'll knock your socks off.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.015
When did you notice this place?

33:48.226 --> 33:50.091
- About two years.
- Two years ago?

34:08.005 --> 34:09.130
Where is he?

34:09.672 --> 34:11.902
We took Ben up to Intensive Care.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.002
Intensive Care.

34:15.208 --> 34:17.177
They're aware of your decision.
You okay?

34:17.344 --> 34:18.333
Yeah.

34:20.112 --> 34:24.014
I just got offered a job managing
a recycling plant in Detroit.

34:24.649 --> 34:26.377
I gotta pick up and move.

34:34.356 --> 34:37.016
Coming back, I just couldn't
help thinking...

34:37.590 --> 34:40.353
...how much easier it would be
if Ben were dead.

34:45.128 --> 34:47.322
What kind of a man thinks like that?

34:50.063 --> 34:53.793
What kind of a father prays
for his own boy to die?

34:57.270 --> 35:01.102
For two years, it's been
just me and Ben.

35:01.305 --> 35:02.636
Been no work.

35:03.140 --> 35:04.505
No friends.

35:05.608 --> 35:06.768
Nobody.

35:08.243 --> 35:10.733
He needs me 24 hours a day...

35:11.045 --> 35:12.272
...to turn him...

35:12.479 --> 35:14.037
...and feed him...

35:17.016 --> 35:19.415
...and sing to him when he cries.

35:26.855 --> 35:28.515
I love my boy.

35:33.860 --> 35:35.918
I've given Ben two years.

35:37.829 --> 35:39.523
Two years.

35:44.066 --> 35:46.556
I just can't give anymore.

35:50.937 --> 35:53.734
I need for this to end.

35:54.139 --> 35:56.663
I need for this to end.

35:59.108 --> 36:00.632
Dear God!

36:18.321 --> 36:19.947
Well, well. Look who's back.

36:20.155 --> 36:21.179
My head.

36:21.389 --> 36:24.915
You took quite a fall. But don't worry,
Deb's been caring for you.

36:25.124 --> 36:27.387
She worked you up real good.

36:32.897 --> 36:36.422
"Blood pressure, 90 over 60.
Respiration..."

36:36.632 --> 36:38.565
"Guaiac negative stool"!
You gave me a rectal?

36:38.767 --> 36:40.495
Haleh thought it would be
good practice.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.033
Good practice?
Good practice!

36:42.236 --> 36:44.864
Settle down.
She has to learn, doesn't she?

36:45.071 --> 36:46.436
Oh, Deb, another thing.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.902
The proper term isn't
"average male genitalia."

36:50.108 --> 36:52.597
- It's "normal male genitalia."
- What?

36:52.809 --> 36:54.470
Where does it say that?

36:57.246 --> 36:59.145
Oh, you guys are just kidding.

37:00.181 --> 37:01.579
So you didn't.

37:02.382 --> 37:03.371
You didn't.

37:04.250 --> 37:05.944
Told you we'd get him.

37:11.421 --> 37:13.979
Do you know where you are,
Mr. Parnell?

37:14.189 --> 37:17.954
In the chump cellar.
Three knockout losses in a row.

37:18.158 --> 37:19.215
Damn!

37:19.993 --> 37:22.290
And I had him against the ropes too.

37:22.928 --> 37:25.453
I stepped into that cross.

37:27.064 --> 37:29.793
Thought you might like
some company, Mr. Desmond.

37:31.066 --> 37:32.430
This is Mr. Parnell.

37:32.635 --> 37:33.931
Hello.

37:35.235 --> 37:37.032
What happened to you?

37:37.771 --> 37:39.931
Don't want to talk about it.

37:42.941 --> 37:45.067
Can I ask you two questions?

37:59.952 --> 38:02.317
I should've warned you
about Morgenstern.

38:02.886 --> 38:06.651
And I should've been more up-front
about the cosigning business.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.858
I didn't know how to tell you.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.863
No one could've done that
thoracotomy under the circumstances.

38:21.064 --> 38:24.556
With Kayson breathing down your neck,
and the hearing next week...

38:24.767 --> 38:27.030
Are you trying to make me feel better?

38:29.837 --> 38:31.736
I'm trying to apologize.

38:32.371 --> 38:34.430
So you can feel better yourself?

38:41.110 --> 38:44.340
Some of us are going
to Doc Magoo's after work.

38:45.247 --> 38:46.680
If you want to come...

39:12.564 --> 39:13.655
Alan?

39:18.968 --> 39:22.528
My buddy Max moved out of the home
last summer, got an apartment.

39:22.737 --> 39:24.670
Been trying to get me
to split the rent.

39:24.871 --> 39:27.396
The problem is the bathroom.

39:28.441 --> 39:29.998
Celadon green.

39:30.642 --> 39:32.473
I asked him to re-tile.

39:33.210 --> 39:35.337
Now I'm thinking...

39:35.678 --> 39:36.975
..."What the hell?"

39:37.647 --> 39:40.705
Sometimes you gotta take
the plunge, you know?

39:43.451 --> 39:46.009
Well, you don't want to
forget your book.

39:47.086 --> 39:48.553
There's a section missing.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.847
Guess which color.

39:53.724 --> 39:54.815
Green.

39:57.592 --> 40:00.219
- Lydia, you going to Magoo's?
- In a few minutes.

40:00.427 --> 40:03.122
- Anyone seen Carol?
- She's upstairs. I'll let her know.

40:03.329 --> 40:05.922
Try and see if you can
get Susan to come.

40:06.198 --> 40:07.825
What a day.

40:12.135 --> 40:13.864
That answers your two questions!

40:14.169 --> 40:18.195
Lydia, somebody should probably
check on Mr. Desmond.

40:24.843 --> 40:27.969
It's soaked in 100-proof alcohol.
It's totally sterile.

40:28.178 --> 40:30.270
I'm not drinking anything
with a worm in it.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.970
- Who's got the tequila?
- Give me your glass, Dr. Ross.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.543
Wait. The curly fries are mine.

40:38.118 --> 40:40.176
You have to sit at the counter
with her.

40:40.519 --> 40:42.850
Hey, I'm not kidding.
Sit at the counter.

40:43.054 --> 40:45.488
They just announced the
$40-million jackpot...

40:45.689 --> 40:47.952
...went to a dry cleaner in Winnetka.

40:48.157 --> 40:50.717
Oh, man! And I was counting
on that money too.

40:50.925 --> 40:52.825
You didn't even kick in.

40:53.260 --> 40:56.661
- You hear about Carter's electroshock?
- Sorry I missed it.

40:56.863 --> 40:59.057
Guess how many condoms
this guy had in his belly.

40:59.264 --> 41:01.424
- 150?
- 185.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.065
And he lived?

41:03.801 --> 41:06.963
Hey, B! I got your double burger,
double cheese here.

41:07.169 --> 41:09.500
Keep your lard-burgers to yourself.

41:09.705 --> 41:12.433
Everybody, listen.
Carol has an announcement.

41:12.639 --> 41:15.300
It's no big deal.
Just keep May 18th open.

41:15.508 --> 41:17.772
That's when Tag and I
are getting married.

41:23.513 --> 41:25.639
- Susan coming?
- Couldn't find her.

41:26.448 --> 41:27.938
- What's this?
- Lotto ticket.

41:28.150 --> 41:29.707
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

41:30.351 --> 41:31.942
How was your rectal?

41:32.918 --> 41:34.284
Hey, I won ten bucks!

41:34.486 --> 41:35.884
Great. Pick up the check.

41:36.088 --> 41:38.351
- What are the odds?
- How can you tell?

41:38.556 --> 41:39.988
Just flip it over.

41:40.191 --> 41:41.986
Let me get a fruit plate.

41:42.192 --> 41:45.956
Let's see, ten-dollar win,
one in 250. Sounds familiar.

41:46.162 --> 41:48.958
Don't think about it.
What are the odds you'll win $ 10...

41:49.162 --> 41:51.596
...set a wedding date and get HIV
on the same day?

41:51.764 --> 41:52.855
You got yogurt?

41:53.665 --> 41:54.927
A bran muffin?

41:56.368 --> 41:58.699
Hey, everyone,
I want to propose a toast.

42:01.438 --> 42:02.597
To Carol.

42:04.540 --> 42:07.701
May your upcoming marriage
bring you laughter...

42:07.908 --> 42:10.034
...and happiness and kids...

42:10.242 --> 42:11.641
...and most of all, love.

42:11.844 --> 42:14.470
God knows you deserve
all of those things.

42:14.779 --> 42:15.904
Hear! Hear!

42:18.214 --> 42:19.475
Congratulations, girl.

42:20.148 --> 42:21.274
To Carol!

42:23.517 --> 42:24.916
About time, Hathaway.

42:25.119 --> 42:26.642
Where's the stripper?

42:29.188 --> 42:30.246
I had a May wedding.

42:31.222 --> 42:33.019
What month did you divorce?

42:33.790 --> 42:35.985
Hey, B, looks like
you put on some weight.

42:36.193 --> 42:38.092
When you say that, smile, brother.

42:38.294 --> 42:40.227
I think you're right, Timmy.

42:40.428 --> 42:44.227
- Rudy and I also have an announcement.
- We got married last week.
