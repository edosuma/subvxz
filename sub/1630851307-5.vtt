WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.006
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:06.756 --> 00:08.508
Yes, Daddy!

00:08.550 --> 00:11.302
If you actually enjoy somebody,
just give it a shot.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.304
We're working with people
who we wouldn't even

00:13.346 --> 00:14.848
speak to in normal
circumstances.

00:14.889 --> 00:17.058
You wouldn't speak to me
in normal circumstance?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.685
You wouldn't speak to me.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.854
Pay attention to master cabin
windows and bridge windows.

00:20.895 --> 00:24.441
It's definitely a new dynamic,
being attracted to my boss.

00:24.482 --> 00:28.361
Roy Orbison Jr. and his wife,
Asa, are repeat charter guests.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.697
This'll be a shorter charter,
so let's make very minute count.

00:30.739 --> 00:31.698
You're gonna be on mids.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.241
Oh, cool.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.534
Because I want you to do
more service and that.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.703
Third stew generally
is laundry bitch.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.747
* We're in the galley and
we're chillin' with daddy *

00:38.788 --> 00:41.207
* We got a lot goin' on,
but we're feelin' so swaggy *

00:41.249 --> 00:42.250
Ugh!

00:44.544 --> 00:45.712
Of, like, human names on there?

00:45.754 --> 00:47.422
-Yes.
-Oh.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.549
Like, what the [bleep]?

00:49.591 --> 00:52.135
Well, you need to be outside so
you can tell us where things go.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.553
Stop it.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.638
I'm the boss of the way
food gets put away.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.642
Mathew is gonna be
at the top of the list.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.436
----ing current's wicked.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.648
Thirty-five feet and closing.

01:05.690 --> 01:06.900
Just line me up.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.485
Happy times!

01:08.526 --> 01:10.236
Okay, guys, are we ready
on our heaving lines?

01:10.278 --> 01:12.113
What is it?
What is it?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.615
Roy, Roy, Roy,
that's not an option anymore.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.158
Hey, Malia!

01:15.200 --> 01:16.409
Keep the line out
of the water, please.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.827
Go to bed now, I'm serious.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.412
-Oh!
-Go to bed, now.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.580
What the [bleep]?

01:20.622 --> 01:21.664
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.500
No, Mzi!

01:40.225 --> 01:42.435
Okay, guys, are we ready
on our heaving lines?

01:42.477 --> 01:43.561
-Yeah.
<i>-What's happening?</i>

01:43.603 --> 01:45.188
<i>Sending stern lines across.</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:46.773
-I love it.
-Hey, Malia!

01:46.815 --> 01:49.150
Go to bed, now.
I'm serious. Go to bed, now.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.777
Keep the line out
of the water, please.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.404
-Hold on.
-What the [bleep]?

01:52.445 --> 01:53.655
Pull that line, pull that line.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.240
No, Mzi!

01:55.281 --> 01:57.784
-Oh, my...
-Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.453
-You okay?
-Yeah.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.623
Take this off slowly,
holding, holding.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.544
-That's all right, you okay?
-Yeah.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.796
We're gonna add extra
lines, correct?

02:09.838 --> 02:11.631
Yeah, once we have you
secured, then we'll add more.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.967
-For the wind.
-Oh, Lord.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.343
Keep pulling?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.594
Port and starboard
bow lines on.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.595
<i>Copy.</i>

02:17.637 --> 02:18.596
All right, Z, you in?

02:18.638 --> 02:19.723
Yeah.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.641
Let's get the passerelle
secured.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.518
Lines snap all the time.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.520
Obviously, that can be
really nerve-wracking.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.855
No worries, no rush.

02:26.896 --> 02:30.191
But Z secured
the lines very quickly.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.360
I'm very impressed.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.446
That's good, you got it, Z.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.613
Nice work.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.490
Okay, let's jump off the boat.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.451
No, you...
we don't do that.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.493
Do you want dessert?

02:40.535 --> 02:41.828
No, let's jump off the boat.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.663
I don't...
you should go to bed, Roy.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.832
Go to bed now, before you
embarrass yourself even more.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.502
You guys are all
embarrassing yourself.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.837
I'm not coming back, okay?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.756
Okay... okay.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.007
-Good.
-Yeah, you good?

02:54.049 --> 02:55.550
Yeah.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.388
Yeah.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.850
So wonderful...

03:03.892 --> 03:05.518
you and Tina have a
wonderful, romantic night.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.519
You're going down?

03:06.561 --> 03:07.896
No, I'm going to bed.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.230
Bye, Roy.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.484
-Yes.
-Yeah, for sure.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.735
Sleep in, man.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.991
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, wow.

03:20.033 --> 03:20.992
So delightful.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.911
I feel so sober, too.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.371
Yeah.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.708
Is there any more spoons?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.585
No, but you can share
this spoon, if you want.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.756
I haven't sucked... no.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.383
Oh, Lexi, you're really funny,

03:36.424 --> 03:38.385
but I don't think you
mean to be funny.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.803
I think you're just being
honest, but you're funny.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.388
Especially so...
she's, like, so straight...

03:41.429 --> 03:42.889
and she's so blunt.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.349
It's, like...

03:44.391 --> 03:46.559
Do you realize
she has a burn list?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.311
Do you have a burn book?

03:54.651 --> 03:56.653
Like, legit, and it was, like...

03:56.695 --> 03:57.696
What's a burn list?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.406
It had, like, 45 names on it.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.949
-I was, like [bleep].
-Wait, what's a burn list?

04:00.990 --> 04:02.951
Is it that
she wants people dead,

04:02.992 --> 04:04.953
or is it who
she wants to bang?

04:04.994 --> 04:06.788
Because I have a banged list.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.626
Yeah.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.046
How many people
have wronged you?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.548
Your name just got
added to the list.

04:18.842 --> 04:19.801
What a day, bruv.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.052
Yeah.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.330
Malia's a good bosun.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.624
Like, she is cream of
the absolute ----ing crop.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.667
-Yeah.
-Man, she's amazing.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.085
Yeah.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.420
Oh, I'm so excited
to drop off tomorrow.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.505
What's your vibes for tomorrow?

04:57.547 --> 05:00.091
I don't know, I can't buzz again
like I did the other night.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.926
Yeah, you...
we'll be ready.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.597
Can I get you any drinks
or anything?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.098
-No.
-You're all good.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.934
Yeah, it's safer to jump
in the ocean with sharks

05:16.983 --> 05:18.693
-It's your bedtime.
-Okay, I am done.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.986
...check.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.696
-I'm going to bed.
-Good night.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.492
You seem way more confident,
you know.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.493
-Yeah.
-Do you feel that?

05:26.534 --> 05:27.869
Yeah.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.746
You're just kind of
owning it now, aw.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.040
It's nice she recognized
how hard I tried.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.500
I'm actually good at this.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.670
You're awake?

05:36.711 --> 05:38.046
I can't sleep.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.714
Oh, no, Dave-O.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.435
The late shift is, like,
the hardest shift.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.729
I remember one day
I was on my second boat,

05:54.771 --> 05:57.482
we had this long night
checklist.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.858
It's, like, 5:00 a.m.
in the morning,

05:58.900 --> 06:00.610
vacuuming the sky lounge,

06:00.652 --> 06:02.570
just crying because I was,
like, "I can't do this."

06:02.612 --> 06:05.407
That's why I rotate my stews,
so they don't feel the same way.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.952
[snoring]

06:13.498 --> 06:14.958
[phone vibrating]

06:21.715 --> 06:22.716
Good morning.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.593
It's all right, we don't judge.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.928
Yes, you do.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.888
You were judging me when
I was talking to myself.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.640
Sorry, I'm talking to myself.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.518
I was just imagining there
was another you right there,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.729
Very intelligent people
talk to themselves.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.481
I Googled it
for comfort last night.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.068
Lloyd, are you trying to say
"non-intelligent" here?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.863
No, I was laughing the
fact that you Googled it.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.531
You know what, I'm gone.
I am gone.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.450
Lexi, you're on fire
this morning.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.076
I have a biology degree.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.747
I got into nursing school, but I
just never had the money to go.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.457
Or, like, when I did
have the money,

06:55.498 --> 06:56.750
I had spent it on, like,
other things.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.084
I bought, like, three cars.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.544
I don't know how
to explain that.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.879
It's just...
it just happened.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.840
I need to put on some makeup
and clothes.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.597
Lex, Lex, Court.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.598
<i>I'm gonna check</i>
<i>the guest cabins.</i>

07:11.639 --> 07:12.891
<i>Copy, yeah, thank you.</i>

07:12.932 --> 07:15.101
Just waiting for
the primary to get up,

07:15.143 --> 07:16.644
and then we can start breakfast.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.854
Do you have the time?

07:17.896 --> 07:19.939
It's about 8:20.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.107
Okay.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.984
Still gonna
have breakfast at 9:00.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.112
Good morning.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.655
Yeah, I'm not sure if
Roy and Asa are coming.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.240
Well, we're gonna sit,
we cannot wait.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.992
All right, awesome,
we'll be up in five minutes.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.954
So, we have three guests
that are up.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.498
They wanna eat now,
because they're not sure

07:36.539 --> 07:39.918
that the primary's
having breakfast.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.294
I gotta wait for Katie.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.796
Can you get Katie?
Is she still sleeping?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.214
-Katie is asleep.
-Okay.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.091
I am the breakfast girl,
so I can't get Katie.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.134
Oh, God.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.969
Let's just do the pastries
first, yeah.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.888
Okay.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.807
Those are lemon-poppy
seed muffins.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.183
Lemon-poppy
seed muffins.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.518
Do you want me to wait
for the other ones?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.061
It's up to you.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.689
Yeah, I'll wait for the...
another bread basket.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.241
That's banana bread.

08:11.282 --> 08:12.701
This one has chocolate,
that one doesn't.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.993
All right.

08:15.704 --> 08:16.955
I'm done being nice.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.206
Like, he's not even a man.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.958
He's just a childish
little boy

08:20.000 --> 08:22.085
trying to wield some
sort of power over me.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.546
So, we have some banana bread.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.131
This one has chocolate
and this side doesn't.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.091
Oh, give me the chocolate side.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.759
Juices.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.558
Good morning.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.892
Chocolate and...

08:37.934 --> 08:39.102
These are raspberry yoghurt
parfaits...

08:39.144 --> 08:40.353
And I can do eggs any style.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.730
-Scrambled eggs.
-I can do scrambled.

08:41.771 --> 08:42.731
-Yeah, scrambled.
-All scrambled?

08:42.772 --> 08:43.732
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.275
All right, great.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.360
Oh, he's amazing, I love him.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.570
Don't tell my husband.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.203
Yeah.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.788
He's like, "Where's
Katie, I need Katie."

08:58.830 --> 09:00.832
He's just very
hot-headed sometimes.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.709
[bleep] me.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.669
On the first charter,
I realized there were

09:04.711 --> 09:06.338
communication problems
with Lexi,

09:06.379 --> 09:08.715
and I was just gonna deal
with Katie from now on.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.801
Always do comms with me...

09:11.843 --> 09:13.928
-I know.
-Because I know. I'll...

09:13.970 --> 09:15.180
Well, she said you guys were
doing water, wine, fire.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.307
I figure if I piss
her off enough,

09:17.349 --> 09:19.642
maybe she won't try to be on
service or be around me at all.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.145
Annoying people
is my superpower.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.064
It's just been amazing, Mat.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.065
Oh, thank you so much.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.066
Enjoy.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.108
Thank you.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.613
-Did you radio me?
-No, I just served it.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.739
Why didn't you radio me?

09:32.781 --> 09:34.115
Because I wanted
to serve them.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.996
-Morning, Lexi.
-Good morning, good morning.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.414
Sorry we're late.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.999
Now we're really sorry.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.834
Oh, God.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.919
Here, look, tuck
this in a little bit,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.295
mm, we're gonna tuck this in.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.296
-Hi.
-Morning.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.964
Morning.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.634
So, they are waiting,
all the pastries are out.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.135
These are for the baby.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.762
Whoa, hold on a minute.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.181
He just walks up with.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.100
-Really?
-Yeah, he's off-off, like...

10:00.141 --> 10:01.142
----ing hell.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.645
Ooh-hoo.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.899
Nothing's going on.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.651
He's just ----ing off.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.241
Okay, go into cabins.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.283
All righty.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.326
Ugh.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.413
Just bury me.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.040
Katie is not even trying
to deal with me and Mathew.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.417
She's just trying to,
like, make sure

10:25.458 --> 10:27.669
he doesn't, like,
have another issue.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.254
Managing is not her strong suit.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.965
She's a nice person,
but nice doesn't always

10:32.007 --> 10:34.009
meet the criteria
for this industry.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.678
Like, damn.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.138
Coming up...

10:38.179 --> 10:40.181
Every day we drop off,
you need to do crew lunch.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.182
Yeah, all right.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.308
----ing bullsh--.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.102
No days off, no hours of rest.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.234
I was ready
to jump off the corner.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.361
I was ready to...

10:53.403 --> 10:54.362
I held you...
I held you back.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.031
I wanted to do it.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.365
Roy, I had a dream where
you actually jumped straight in,

10:57.407 --> 10:59.367
and I was, like, oh.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.869
Okay, can someone just
tell me...

11:00.910 --> 11:01.870
Nothing's going on.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.329
He's ----ing off.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.961
Okay, go into cabins.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.212
-All righty.
-It's drop-off day!

11:11.254 --> 11:12.881
[bleep] yeah.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.507
That was hectic to walk into.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.802
The systems and the way things
work is the easy part of my job.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.263
It's managing
people and emotions

11:20.305 --> 11:22.057
is where it gets really hard.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.892
Like, she's the second stew,

11:23.933 --> 11:26.561
so she is gonna be on breakfast
with him from time to time.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.979
They need to work
through their differences.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.522
Like, you still
have a job to do.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.863
Okay, so...

11:38.365 --> 11:40.033
It's just really hectic
to walk into.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.368
Everyone's just, like, meh.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.288
[alarm blares]

11:45.330 --> 11:46.831
What's that?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.041
It's a fire alarm.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.542
Eat up!

11:49.584 --> 11:50.794
What the [bleep] is that?

11:53.505 --> 11:54.964
Captain, that is not galley.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.181
As distracting as that is,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.391
it can't get me away
from this table.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.558
No.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.853
Why did that go?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.023
No way.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.067
Anyone know why
the fire alarm went off?

12:14.109 --> 12:16.027
Air freshener... me.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.074
Ah, now the whole
boat knows, ha ha!

12:21.116 --> 12:22.951
It's bad enough to set off
a fire alarm on the boat.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.328
It's another thing
to have to explain it

12:25.370 --> 12:28.081
in front of the girl
I'm attracted to.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.959
But you know what?
Sh-- happens.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.169
What a way to wake up
in the morning.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.462
-Good morning!
-That was a false alarm.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.839
Oh!

12:35.880 --> 12:36.965
Someone sprayed
too much deodorant.

12:37.007 --> 12:37.966
Mm!

12:38.008 --> 12:39.300
Enjoy your breakfast.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.552
Okay, this morning was crazy.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.971
I was, like, okay, Mat.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.848
Chill the [bleep] out here.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.933
Sorry if you feel like you've
been in cabins and laundry.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.268
Yeah, why are you doing that?

12:48.309 --> 12:51.604
I think if we rotate,
it keeps it fresh.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.189
You're like, "No."

12:53.231 --> 12:54.607
I get what you're
trying to say, but no.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.860
That's the vibe I'm thinking.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.486
Katie is good
at playing innocent.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.531
She's like, "I have
no idea what's going on."

13:01.573 --> 13:03.324
But you're choosing
sides with Mat,

13:03.366 --> 13:05.452
and you're pretending
you have both of our backs,

13:05.493 --> 13:06.494
which is bullsh--.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.371
Thank you for the wipe down.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.914
No problem.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.587
-Pretty soon.
-Okay.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.297
If there's something that
you really wanna

13:17.339 --> 13:18.298
do on the boat still,
we got a little bit of time.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.507
Hide-and-seek.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.134
Oh, I know you love
hide-and-seek.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.469
All right, guys,
we'll be in our epaulettes

13:22.510 --> 13:25.096
no later than 11:30,
and then luggage.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.307
Yeah, hide-and-go-seek.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.683
Captain Sandy!

13:28.725 --> 13:29.934
We can
play hide-and-go-seek.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.019
-Hide-and-go-seek?
-Yay!

13:31.061 --> 13:32.520
-That sounds right?
-Yeah.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.189
Oh, crocodile skin.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.024
Yeah, Crocodile Dundee.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.484
I watched that the other day.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.361
There are some very
derogatory words in there.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.112
Wow, they hid really
good in here.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.199
Keep on looking,
where are they, Bo?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.201
I was like, there's no way
that that should be being said.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.952
What?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.412
We're just talking about
"Crocodile Dundee."

13:49.454 --> 13:50.663
Of course.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.334
Found you!

13:54.376 --> 13:56.378
I found you!

13:56.419 --> 13:59.047
You found me!

13:59.089 --> 14:00.590
But you have to find
everybody, Roy.

14:00.632 --> 14:01.591
Let's go see.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.717
Yeah, you gotta find everybody.

14:02.759 --> 14:03.718
-Have you seen Mommy?
-No.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.553
Bo-Bo, where's Mommy?

14:05.595 --> 14:07.722
Found you!

14:07.764 --> 14:10.225
Oh, my God!
There's Mommy!

14:10.266 --> 14:11.726
All crew, all crew,

14:11.768 --> 14:13.937
let's get into our whites
for guest departure.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.648
Okay, Bo-Bo, we have to pack
and get outta here.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.446
-Is that everything?
-I think so.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.240
Sweet.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.616
I got a baby.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.160
-Get on the line.
-On the line, on the line.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.245
Heh.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.663
I'm gonna give you a hug, Z.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.415
-Lovely to meet you.
-It's been so great.

14:33.456 --> 14:34.541
Whoa!

14:34.582 --> 14:35.583
Bye, Bo, I'll miss you, buddy.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.751
Have a safe trip home.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.962
-Mwah!
-Thank you, Courtney.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.505
Thank you so much
for everything.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.048
We've had the best time.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.591
Yeah, this boat trip
is everything

14:43.633 --> 14:45.260
we could have wished for.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.096
-Mat is the most surprising.
-Oh!

14:48.138 --> 14:49.264
You make things that I
didn't know that I wanted.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.515
Oh, thank you.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.516
Here is the gratuity.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.018
Thank you.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.603
And I guess it's time
for us to split.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.732
Thank you, guys.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.692
Bye!

15:00.734 --> 15:02.986
Let's change out of our whites,
then we'll turn the boat around.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.988
-Woo!
-Nice work.

15:05.030 --> 15:05.989
Thank you, thank you.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.490
Nice job!

15:12.495 --> 15:14.080
Nice work.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.123
Let's get changed,
then we'll meet up here.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.499
Yo, vibe check.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.462
Oh.

15:20.503 --> 15:23.381
Mathew, every day we drop off,
you need to do crew lunch.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.386
I thought I'd have the day
to clean and organize.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.763
-I'm sorry.
-All right.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.348
-Just do crew lunch.
-Got it.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.267
Let's [bleep] this puppy.

15:34.309 --> 15:37.020
We're in the lower guest cabins
and we're getting freaky.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.315
All crew, all crew,

15:40.357 --> 15:41.608
meet me in the main salon
for our tip meeting.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.651
Just in time.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.612
----ing hell.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.654
Opa!

15:46.696 --> 15:47.655
-Okay.
-That's it?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.199
Yeah.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.244
Honestly, I don't even
know where to start.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.414
This is my first season
ever that I've not heard

15:56.456 --> 15:59.584
one guest complain,
other than when we cooked.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.086
Fair enough, though.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.087
-Okay?
-Right.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.088
That was understood.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.465
This tip is $21,000.

16:05.507 --> 16:06.508
Woo!

16:06.549 --> 16:08.510
Fourteen-fifty euros per person.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.761
-Woo!
-Amazing.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.054
-Yes.
-Isn't that great?

16:11.096 --> 16:12.305
Awesome.

16:12.347 --> 16:13.640
We got a boat to turn around,

16:13.682 --> 16:14.557
then you're gonna
go out to dinner.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.354
-All right, enjoy your night.
-Thank you.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.106
I'm hungry.
I'm really, really hungry.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.649
Oh, my God.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.317
Bye, Felicia.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.402
----ing bullsh--.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.569
Yeah, just go get lunch ready.

16:26.611 --> 16:27.696
Oh!

16:27.737 --> 16:29.114
You guys ----ing suck.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.115
Oh, what happened to Mathew?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.658
Yeah, he had to cook lunch.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.702
He's irritated that
he has to cook lunch,

16:33.743 --> 16:37.455
which is quite weird.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.207
It's like, we need to eat.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.542
That's a sensitive subject.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.710
It's the norm, like...

16:41.751 --> 16:42.752
Oh, making lunch?

16:42.794 --> 16:45.380
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.424
I thought, like, I'd have
a chance to sit down

16:47.465 --> 16:50.385
and plan menus and write
inventories and do prep.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.137
It's just what needs
to be done

16:52.178 --> 16:55.390
when you're your own department
and get no support.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.641
Like, on every boat
I've been on,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.643
even on drop-off day,
we get lunch.

16:58.685 --> 17:03.106
It's not sustainable if there's
no time off in between trips.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.482
Instead of cleaning,

17:04.524 --> 17:06.484
I have to ----ing cook
on the off day.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.739
And I think it's ----ed up that
the crew can't do this for me.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.367
No days off, no hours of rest,
everyone else is a team.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.744
Like, they suck.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.245
-Mathew.
-What?

17:17.287 --> 17:19.789
That is part of your job.

17:19.831 --> 17:20.874
Listen, I don't wanna
talk about it.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.175
No days off, no hours of rest,
everyone else is a team.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.303
Like, they suck.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.804
-Mathew.
-What?

17:34.846 --> 17:36.181
What can we help with?

17:36.222 --> 17:37.474
No, I'm good.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.686
Deck crew can make paninis,
it's not a big deal.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.812
I'm good, Malia.
I'm all good.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.189
You're not good.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.815
We're a team.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.650
You're part of that team,
whether you like it or not.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.486
-But listen, but... but it...
-No, no, no, you listen.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.653
Let us ----ing help you.

17:50.695 --> 17:51.863
-Yeah.
-Is that hard?

17:51.905 --> 17:53.490
No, that's easy,
it's just tough

17:53.531 --> 17:54.574
because it's a lot
in my head, you know?

17:54.616 --> 17:56.534
Yeah.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.952
It's not that I'm just, like,
stressed about crew food.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.497
I definitely have
experience coddling chefs.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.832
----ing like, guests arrive
in an hour.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.668
How am I supposed
to put all this away?

18:04.709 --> 18:06.252
We'll help you.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.712
This is so ----ing unfair.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.423
Like, you just kinda wanna,
like, shake them and be,

18:10.465 --> 18:12.967
like, this is your job.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.303
I know it sucks solo chef,
this size.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.596
I know, I'm just being a baby.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.014
I pegged you as a crier.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.015
Only during sex.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.475
There we go.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.772
That's not folded right.

18:27.023 --> 18:27.982
Have you got a rowdy shirt?

18:28.024 --> 18:29.359
I do, do you have a rowdy...

18:29.401 --> 18:30.527
Yeah, rowdy shirts.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.528
Are we rowdy-shirting tonight?

18:31.569 --> 18:35.448
Yeah.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.909
We all have tough jobs.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.371
All crew, all crew, lunch is up.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.539
-Is that lunch?
-Yeah.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.000
Oh, yeah.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.251
I mean...

18:47.752 --> 18:48.962
-Polenta.
-It's polenta.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.630
Is it?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.010
All right, fine, fine.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.594
I'm fussed.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.265
Mat gets wired very quickly
and he spirals.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.643
So, what Mat
needs now is reassurance

19:03.685 --> 19:05.395
and a ----ing kick up the ass.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.565
Share the fuss, yeah?

19:08.606 --> 19:09.858
-Share the fuss.
-Yeah!

19:11.484 --> 19:12.610
-Hi.
-Hi, Mama.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.737
Hi, Dad, you okay?

19:13.778 --> 19:14.988
I'm all right, how are you?

19:15.030 --> 19:17.741
Yeah, I'm just working.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.453
Oh, my God, 16 and a half hour
day, like, every day on charter.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.548
Well, I'll try and ring you
on my break or something.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.924
Yeah.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.469
Um...

19:40.138 --> 19:41.556
Sorry.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.032
I love you.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.617
<i>-Okay, all right, love you.</i>
-Bye.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.620
<i>-Take care, bye.</i>
-Love you, bye.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.039
Whew, okay.

20:07.916 --> 20:08.875
What time are we
supposed to leave?

20:08.917 --> 20:09.876
5:30.

20:09.918 --> 20:11.461
[bleep]

20:11.503 --> 20:13.129
Party time!

20:13.171 --> 20:14.631
Let's get the party started.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.014
All right, boys, the shirts.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.433
-Yeah.
-Yeah, nice.

20:25.475 --> 20:26.518
-Courtney.
-Yeah?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.062
-Are you wearing heels?
-No.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.064
I don't know, man,
how about you?

20:31.106 --> 20:32.482
Who's your demon?

20:41.825 --> 20:42.826
No, but...

20:43.868 --> 20:44.994
-L?
-No, mine is L.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.496
There's only one L.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.622
There's two L's in Lloyd.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.833
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

20:49.874 --> 20:51.918
H, I, J, K, L-M-N-O-P.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.461
Oh...

20:53.503 --> 20:55.046
There we go, you know
it now, one after.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.469
L, M.

21:02.887 --> 21:03.847
You can all get ----ed.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.557
Sit back down.

21:07.892 --> 21:09.811
Okay, daddy needs to get
a little loose right now.

21:12.230 --> 21:15.108
-Ah!
-Night out number two.

21:15.150 --> 21:16.776
Yeah, baby.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.155
Woo!

21:20.196 --> 21:21.698
Dude, it's so ----ing beautiful.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.116
Yeah.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.201
I love this, it's so cute.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.745
Oh!

21:26.786 --> 21:28.038
To the right.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.915
-Oh, my God, this is so cute!
-Epic!

21:30.957 --> 21:34.544
Okay, one, two, three.

21:34.586 --> 21:36.087
Please, can I have an
aperol spritz?

21:36.129 --> 21:37.172
Rosé, please.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.506
Yeah, we're gonna sit down.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.175
Thank you ever so much.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.218
-Cheers, guys.
-Cheers!

21:42.260 --> 21:43.845
Are you ready to order, guys?

21:43.887 --> 21:44.846
I'll have the sea bass.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.598
The steak.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.558
I'll have the tartuffo,
please, and a bottle of rosé.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.642
-Ooh!
-Oh.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.855
Don't you think Z should
grow his 'fro

21:53.897 --> 21:54.898
until the end of the season?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.066
-Yeah.
-Yes!

21:56.107 --> 21:57.108
If you go to the
end of the season,

21:57.150 --> 21:58.568
I'll give you another lap dance.

21:58.610 --> 21:59.694
Oh!

22:01.112 --> 22:04.741
Yeah, get it, Court,
get it, Court!

22:04.783 --> 22:08.119
Does everyone remember
the kiss that night or...

22:08.161 --> 22:09.245
Oh!

22:09.287 --> 22:10.747
Daddy, get you some!

22:10.789 --> 22:12.499
Guys, you dance with someone,

22:12.540 --> 22:14.584
that's just what happens,
it's just a thing.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.628
And then we were
like, woo, yeah!

22:16.670 --> 22:19.589
-Thank you, Courtney.
-You're welcome, babes.

22:19.631 --> 22:20.757
Oh, yes.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.509
Thank you.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.807
Hold on.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.144
-Lord what?
-Fussy.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.605
Fussy.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.731
What's your sign again?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.608
Scorpio, we're freaky.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.485
How did you meet
your last girlfriend?

22:41.569 --> 22:43.113
We were vibing at a sex party.

22:43.154 --> 22:46.282
Eww, what are you talking about?

22:46.324 --> 22:47.659
Yeah. It's true.

22:47.701 --> 22:50.120
-I would like to raise a toast.
-Aw!

22:50.161 --> 22:51.746
To a mad bunch of [bleep].

22:51.788 --> 22:53.289
Yeah!

22:53.331 --> 22:55.166
We smashed it so far, and
we will continue to do so.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.793
Yes!

22:56.835 --> 22:57.836
Drink, mother----er,
drink mother----er drink.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.212
Hey!

22:59.254 --> 23:02.507
Dave, I am glad you
joined us this dinner.

23:02.549 --> 23:03.967
You were so shy last time.

23:04.009 --> 23:05.552
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.137
-Cheers, mate.
-Cheers, mate.

23:07.178 --> 23:08.555
I love Dave.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.015
We know.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.683
I haven't even jerked off
in, like, a month.

23:11.725 --> 23:12.934
Mat.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.146
Dude, stop.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.148
But you know why
I don't give a [bleep]?

23:18.189 --> 23:20.233
Because I've had
too many accomplishments

23:20.275 --> 23:22.610
working for too many douchebags.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.529
So, I'm better than
them no matter what I say.

23:24.571 --> 23:25.864
Well.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.824
To sucking piss.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.284
All right, how about a...

23:29.325 --> 23:31.661
I couldn't perform well
at my first sex party.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.163
Nobody cares.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.164
I went in, and I was,
like, yeah, I'm ready.

23:34.205 --> 23:35.248
Mat, shut the [bleep] up.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.125
Don't say that.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.169
-Anyways...
-[bleep]

23:39.210 --> 23:41.838
How many of us have to tell
you to shut the [bleep] up?

23:41.880 --> 23:43.548
I don't get it.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.800
You're talking sh-- at a meal,
eating our dinner,

23:45.842 --> 23:48.053
so shut the [bleep] up and
enjoy your meal.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.722
Let's talk more about Dave
and less about that.

23:50.764 --> 23:53.016
You're the one ----ing
talking about it, bro.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.768
I don't like people
giving me sh--.

23:54.809 --> 23:58.188
I've worked too hard to get sh--
for being myself.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.023
Oi.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.650
Give me crap about being myself,
it's like [bleep] you.

24:02.692 --> 24:03.693
I'm going home.

24:03.735 --> 24:04.694
-Mat.
-No, don't...

24:24.339 --> 24:25.006
Mat, shut the [bleep] up.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.093
You're talking sh-- at a meal,
eating our dinners,

24:28.134 --> 24:29.135
so shut the [bleep] up.

24:29.177 --> 24:30.762
Gimme crap about being myself.

24:30.804 --> 24:31.971
It's like [bleep] you.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.056
I'm going home.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.057
-Mat.
-No, don't...

24:34.099 --> 24:35.850
-He'll get lost.
-Ah!

24:38.895 --> 24:40.105
[bleep] you people.

24:42.065 --> 24:44.651
I worked so hard
to get where I am.

24:46.903 --> 24:47.946
Chefs, chefs, that's it.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.447
Chefs. Let's chalk it up...

24:49.489 --> 24:51.741
I told... I told everybody,
chefs all have a thing.

24:51.783 --> 24:53.660
Mat's taken an early taxi.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.120
He just needs
to get back to sleep.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.788
He just needs to not be here.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.373
They can [bleep] right off.

24:58.415 --> 25:01.668
Anyways, let's just keep Mat
on his positive level

25:01.710 --> 25:04.170
for the rest of the season.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.714
Because I don't think
anyone wants to cook steak.

25:07.132 --> 25:09.009
Okay, I need rest,
so I'm going to bed.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.054
-Okay.
-[bleep]

25:13.096 --> 25:14.305
All right, here we go!

25:14.347 --> 25:17.142
-Woo!
-Yes!

25:17.183 --> 25:18.810
[shouting]

25:27.152 --> 25:28.361
Yeah, boy!

25:29.946 --> 25:31.281
He got it goin' on.

25:32.490 --> 25:33.783
It wasn't even my birthday.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.370
You're the best, Daddy.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.042
I'm done.

25:49.841 --> 25:52.052
But if I was gonna chat to
my brother, it should be now.

25:52.093 --> 25:56.264
My name's Courtney, and
we're on the boat together...

25:56.306 --> 25:58.224
bru like us.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.935
My brother Josh, he's a chief
officer on a superyacht.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.020
Do you have a girlfriend, Josh?

26:02.062 --> 26:03.355
Yes.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.856
He's always been
an inspiration to me.

26:04.898 --> 26:06.524
Growing up, all the girls
used to love him

26:06.566 --> 26:08.943
and have a big crush on him.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.820
Hello, Joshua.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.238
Should I call you Captain?

26:12.280 --> 26:14.032
Are you captain?
[bleep] off.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.076
Wait, Z, your phone just died.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.952
I'm glad.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.959
See that?
----ing like, quitting.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.836
Just be nice, baby,
that's my motto.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.881
[chattering]

26:33.843 --> 26:35.220
Why do we, when
we get drunk,

26:35.261 --> 26:37.013
we just wanna, like,
Facetime our family?

26:37.055 --> 26:38.223
I wanna call my family now.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.974
It's his mother.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.560
Whoa!

26:42.602 --> 26:43.895
Okay, let's walk away,
let's go to the bathroom.

26:43.937 --> 26:45.313
Let's go to the bathroom.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.107
Just keep walking,
just walk to the bathroom.

26:47.148 --> 26:48.983
Go ahead.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.276
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

27:05.458 --> 27:08.128
Like, it's hard losing a
parent that you're close to.

27:14.968 --> 27:17.262
I'm gonna drink, because
I'm trying to, like, I [bleep].

27:17.303 --> 27:20.056
Yeah, like, I'm so sorry.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.307
I will leave
you the bill here...

27:21.349 --> 27:22.517
-All right.
-We're doing bills.

27:22.559 --> 27:23.852
We have to
go downstairs and pay.

27:28.523 --> 27:29.482
Okay, I need to pay.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.234
I think they got everything.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.444
Thank you.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.863
I have cash.

27:34.904 --> 27:36.489
I need to pay 300.

27:38.992 --> 27:39.951
Malia's paid.

27:39.993 --> 27:40.994
Thank you.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.370
We've all paid what we ordered.

27:42.412 --> 27:43.997
She's actually paid already?

27:44.039 --> 27:45.331
No, no, no, we have...

27:45.373 --> 27:47.167
like, everyone's
paid their share.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.543
-Okay, so give me the...
-Lexi, you still have to pay.

27:51.087 --> 27:53.173
No, Mzi, pause.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.466
We're all paying 300.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.967
Lloyd [bleep] off.
Anyways, Malia...

27:56.009 --> 27:57.427
Yeah.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.971
Since your name is Malia
and not Lloyd, give me...

28:00.013 --> 28:02.140
tell me what I owe you in euros,

28:02.182 --> 28:03.266
and then I will give
that to you.

28:03.308 --> 28:04.601
Three hundred.

28:04.642 --> 28:06.519
Pause... don't make me
be a bitch here.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.484
No one's calling you dumb.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.986
It's like,
I can be smarter than you.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.071
I paid for you.

28:17.655 --> 28:19.157
I... I paid for you.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.659
I love you.
Because I love you.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.203
I love you.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.537
I'm a cheap person,
but I pay my bill.

28:24.579 --> 28:26.247
Like, I pay my dues in life.

28:26.289 --> 28:27.999
I don't like
to owe people anything.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.376
I can be a real asshole.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.002
We've all paid,
and we've all tipped.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.545
Let's ----ing rock on.

28:32.587 --> 28:33.880
I don't know what just happened.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.925
I don't get that.

28:42.305 --> 28:44.557
Oh, my God, these streets
are beautiful.

28:49.229 --> 28:50.188
Yo, what's up, man?

28:50.230 --> 28:51.523
Yeah, you have a spare bag?

28:51.564 --> 28:53.483
I'm going home.
I'm done. I quit.

28:53.525 --> 28:54.901
[bleep] that.

28:57.946 --> 28:59.531
I don't know.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.241
-[bleep] that.
-How's this?

29:01.282 --> 29:02.575
Fit enough sh-- in it?

29:02.617 --> 29:06.037
Yeah, I'm done, yeah.
I'm done.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.248
They can find some ----er
to do their sh--.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.010
Oh, my...
oh, my God!

29:20.051 --> 29:22.137
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no!

29:22.178 --> 29:23.430
-Is he okay?
-Well sh--.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.432
Oh sh--.

29:25.473 --> 29:28.518
Good luck, you'll have some
----ing asshole chef now.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.103
[bleep].

29:31.688 --> 29:33.565
He's not okay.
Dude, he's not okay.

29:33.606 --> 29:35.233
All right, let's go.
I'm done.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.402
I'm done, just stop
----ing walking with me.

29:37.444 --> 29:38.403
You're walking.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.238
Get off my ----ing face.

29:47.662 --> 29:48.163
Thank you, Daddy.

29:50.457 --> 29:51.583
I don't know.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.044
All right, let's go.

29:54.085 --> 29:55.420
I'm done.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.422
I'm done, just stop
----ing walking with me.

29:57.464 --> 29:59.132
Get off my ----ing face.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.383
I don't know what that was.

30:00.425 --> 30:01.426
That was just
a weird moment in time.

30:01.468 --> 30:04.095
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

30:04.137 --> 30:05.972
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Z.

30:06.014 --> 30:08.266
Z!

30:08.308 --> 30:09.434
-You had one job!
-Is he okay?

30:09.476 --> 30:11.269
It's fine.
It's fine.

30:11.311 --> 30:13.104
You're laughing, but your
mouth is covered in blood.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.105
Yeah, no, that's fine.

30:14.147 --> 30:16.066
-Oh!
-Ugh!

30:16.107 --> 30:18.109
Owie. My head hurts.

30:18.151 --> 30:19.986
Okay, you've cut your top lip,

30:20.028 --> 30:21.571
it's just bleeding down
your ----ing teeth, it's fine.

30:21.613 --> 30:24.699
[bleep] me.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.993
How cute was it talking
to everyone's family?

30:27.035 --> 30:28.036
Yeah.

30:29.496 --> 30:30.497
Yeah.

30:32.290 --> 30:34.000
So your half-brother, then?

30:36.086 --> 30:37.545
I have an adopted brother!

30:40.757 --> 30:43.259
So, were you adopted when
you were a baby-baby?

30:45.387 --> 30:47.055
So, you never got to meet
your mom and dad, then?

31:02.529 --> 31:04.197
And yeah.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.242
Come here.
Come here, bro.

31:07.283 --> 31:08.660
-You have a heart of gold.
-You're a ----ing diamond.

31:08.702 --> 31:10.120
Eh?

31:11.329 --> 31:13.123
-Boo?
-Yeah.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.165
You okay?

31:17.752 --> 31:19.546
We all have a story, right?

31:21.339 --> 31:23.133
This is why we've both
been crying in the toilet.

31:23.174 --> 31:24.718
No, I totally get it.
I thought...

31:24.759 --> 31:28.304
I did not understand that, and I
apologize for not knowing that.

31:28.346 --> 31:29.472
It's fine.

31:29.514 --> 31:30.557
Why is it feeling so heavy
tonight?

31:32.392 --> 31:33.351
I'm just overall miserable.

31:33.393 --> 31:34.728
Oh, I need both my girls.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.688
It's good to have
an understanding that

31:36.730 --> 31:38.857
oh, they're actually dealing
with a ----ing lot right now.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.692
I couldn't even imagine.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.694
There's no timeframe
that will tell you

31:42.736 --> 31:44.446
when you should feel
okay about that.

31:44.487 --> 31:47.490
Deal with it however the [bleep]
you need to deal with it.

31:47.532 --> 31:49.075
I just wanna be there for them.

31:55.749 --> 31:57.542
-Do we think he's gonna be up?
-Yeah.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.252
Yeah, I think he'll be
drinking when we get back.

32:01.296 --> 32:03.089
Okay, you go, Boo,
you get out.

32:05.884 --> 32:07.719
-Hot tubbing?
-Yeah!

32:07.761 --> 32:09.387
We're gonna wake up Sandy.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.431
[snoring]

32:11.473 --> 32:12.724
I have a headache.

32:12.766 --> 32:14.225
I can get rid of it
with hot tub.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.226
-Hot tub?
-Yeah.

32:15.268 --> 32:17.479
Yeah?

32:17.520 --> 32:18.521
Why, he's not in his cabin?

32:18.563 --> 32:20.231
Mat's not in his cabin?

32:20.273 --> 32:22.108
Well, as long as he's not
----ing up my interior.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.777
All right, who's coming
to the ----ing hot tub?

32:23.818 --> 32:25.820
Lexi!

32:25.862 --> 32:28.323
We're going for the hot tub,
we're gonna chill, 34 degrees.

32:28.365 --> 32:30.617
I can't ----ing...
Lexi!

32:30.658 --> 32:33.536
Open the ----ing door, boo.

32:33.578 --> 32:34.913
I'm coming.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.415
-Sorry, I'm ----ing naked.
-No problem.

32:37.457 --> 32:40.418
Oh, why do I have hundreds
in my ----ing bathing suit?

32:40.460 --> 32:42.587
Oh, that's where
my hundreds were.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.381
I've got two bottles.

32:44.422 --> 32:45.799
We need plastic.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.258
Ow.

32:49.678 --> 32:52.305
You plan on spending
money at the hot tub?

32:53.973 --> 32:55.809
Anybody can get snapped at.

32:55.850 --> 32:58.436
But, like, tonight, with
the bill, that was just...

32:58.478 --> 33:00.230
Courtney, who's had way
more drinks than you,

33:00.271 --> 33:01.439
can tell me what the
total was, and what...

33:01.481 --> 33:02.857
But she didn't.

33:02.899 --> 33:04.734
She just actually
took care of the 300 kuna

33:04.776 --> 33:06.277
that we asked you to pay.

33:06.319 --> 33:07.612
I don't wanna do this,
I really don't.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.781
Let's avoid this topic
at all costs.

33:13.660 --> 33:16.162
Why do you keep referring
to yourself as Satan?

33:20.417 --> 33:22.335
Is that in the Bahamas,
with your burn list?

33:25.255 --> 33:26.631
Oh.

33:27.632 --> 33:28.842
Oh!

33:33.430 --> 33:37.267
Because people that live in
an $8,000 high-rise

33:37.308 --> 33:39.185
reserve the right
to be a [bleep]?

33:39.227 --> 33:41.813
No, I feel like you like
to be a [bleep]

33:41.855 --> 33:44.649
and you like to get away with
it, and you're not my boss.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.401
Oh, God.

33:46.443 --> 33:47.986
What the [bleep]?

33:48.028 --> 33:51.364
It's, like, it was obviously
a miscommunication.

33:54.784 --> 33:56.327
-Hi, Lloyd.
-Hello.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.872
Hey!

34:02.334 --> 34:03.501
Yeah, yeah, bitches.

34:06.254 --> 34:09.007
Yeah, you like that, Daddy?

34:09.049 --> 34:10.258
Woo!

34:15.680 --> 34:17.474
You, truth or dare?

34:17.515 --> 34:18.850
Truth.

34:18.892 --> 34:22.312
Have you ever ----ed
anybody in guest areas?

34:22.354 --> 34:23.521
Oh!

34:23.563 --> 34:24.773
-Yes, she did.
-You did?

34:24.814 --> 34:26.775
-Yeah.
-Okay, yeah.

34:26.816 --> 34:28.318
Oh.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.861
I'm not afraid
to hook up on a boat.

34:29.903 --> 34:32.864
You know, and the chief
officer's a little bit cute.

34:32.906 --> 34:34.991
-Owie.
-Oh!

34:35.033 --> 34:36.534
Courtney!

34:36.576 --> 34:38.536
Okay, David, truth or dare?

34:38.578 --> 34:39.537
-Dare.
-Dare...

34:39.579 --> 34:42.999
Run around the whole bow naked.

34:43.041 --> 34:46.294
Yes!

34:47.295 --> 34:49.798
-Ah!
-Woo-woo!

34:56.930 --> 34:58.056
I'm impressed.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.974
Not with him being naked,

35:00.016 --> 35:02.435
I just mean that
he did the dare.

35:05.939 --> 35:07.691
I didn't think you'd do it.

35:18.785 --> 35:22.706
David, shut your ----ing
kiss-ass ass up.

35:22.747 --> 35:23.957
Wait, we didn't hear...

35:23.998 --> 35:25.875
You ----ing kiss-ass
mother----er.

35:25.917 --> 35:28.920
Okay, anyway.

35:28.962 --> 35:30.296
I know.

35:31.715 --> 35:33.591
Honestly, it's very ----ing
hard to ask.

35:33.633 --> 35:35.719
David, stop kissing ass.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.766
What? What?

35:41.808 --> 35:44.310
Lloyd, I thought you liked me?

35:52.402 --> 35:53.945
Shut the [bleep] up!

35:53.987 --> 35:56.489
Hey, Lloyd, are you ----ing--

36:02.912 --> 36:03.955
Yeah.

36:03.997 --> 36:06.916
Why are you so angry, Lloyd?

36:13.131 --> 36:14.966
Please, please,
please sit down.

36:15.008 --> 36:16.593
He's walking away, Court,
let him go.

36:16.634 --> 36:18.470
Oh!

36:21.848 --> 36:23.683
Hey, stop it.

36:23.725 --> 36:25.977
-Okay, Lexi's--
-Don't say that.

36:26.019 --> 36:28.396
Lloyd, please come back in.

36:28.438 --> 36:30.440
No, I'll be back in a bit.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.359
This girl's got
no social understanding

36:32.400 --> 36:34.027
of what is acceptable
to be said.

36:38.073 --> 36:39.949
Okay, I take that back.

36:39.991 --> 36:42.035
But when it goes more than just
words, I don't wanna be touched.

36:42.077 --> 36:43.536
I just wanted
to get outta there.

36:44.954 --> 36:48.416
No, it's not cool,
it's not cool.

36:48.458 --> 36:49.668
-Oh, babes...
-Z, shut the [bleep] up.

36:49.709 --> 36:52.629
Like, I can't--

36:52.671 --> 36:53.880
[bleep]

36:53.922 --> 36:55.465
-No, no, no, sit down.
-Seriously...

36:55.507 --> 36:57.634
Lexi, do you wanna elaborate
on that?

36:57.676 --> 36:58.677
Oh, my God.

37:00.053 --> 37:01.554
Everyone shut the [bleep] up.

37:04.724 --> 37:06.559
Let's just be ----ing deckhands!

37:06.601 --> 37:09.145
Oh, you ----ing deckhands!

37:09.187 --> 37:10.855
Oh, my God.

37:10.897 --> 37:12.524
That's good, I'm going to bed.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.526
She didn't mean that like that.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.945
Yeah, she doesn't mean anything
that she says to take offense,

37:16.986 --> 37:18.655
but it is offensive, isn't it?

37:18.697 --> 37:20.448
Get over it, I'm not
kissing your ass.

37:20.490 --> 37:21.741
Oh, my God.

37:21.783 --> 37:22.992
Like, if you want me
to kiss your ass.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.495
-Let's go to bed.
-Go to bed.

37:25.537 --> 37:27.038
[bleep]'s sake.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.416
Like, she doesn't know me.
I'm ----ing Satan.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.543
I love deckhands, by the way.

37:31.584 --> 37:32.544
I'm going to bed.

37:32.585 --> 37:33.545
Lloyd, gimme a hug.

37:33.586 --> 37:34.879
Can I grab...

37:34.921 --> 37:36.631
No, there's nothing
to hug about.

37:36.673 --> 37:37.716
Come here, she was ----ed with
me too, don't worry.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.884
Dude, she's a ----ing asshole.

37:42.178 --> 37:43.596
I don't give a [bleep] Courtney.

37:43.638 --> 37:44.889
I just wanna give
you a head's up.

37:44.931 --> 37:46.141
Oh, no, what?

37:46.182 --> 37:48.977
Lexi was just a total
----ing [bleep].

37:49.019 --> 37:49.978
-To you?
-No, to all of us.

37:50.020 --> 37:51.104
Oh!

37:51.146 --> 37:52.147
She made Lloyd cry.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.815
I can...
I can...

37:53.857 --> 37:55.567
I'll go find her.

37:55.608 --> 37:58.069
I obviously don't feel
great being the ----ing bad guy.

37:58.111 --> 38:01.239
Like, an adult disciplining
another adult, it's not fun.

38:01.281 --> 38:03.199
Right now, I really don't
wanna deal with Lexi.

38:03.241 --> 38:06.202
But this is what... I'm...
I'm just trying to help.

38:06.244 --> 38:07.203
David [bleep] off.

38:07.245 --> 38:08.496
This is not your time.

38:08.538 --> 38:09.748
David, yes, come in.

38:09.789 --> 38:11.624
No, [bleep] off.

38:11.666 --> 38:13.460
This is not giving us
valuable advice here.

38:13.501 --> 38:15.587
-But your nip's out.
-It's okay.

38:15.628 --> 38:17.088
Okay, what the [bleep]
is going on?

38:17.130 --> 38:18.214
I don't... I don't wanna
get in trouble for this.

38:18.256 --> 38:19.758
No one's getting in trouble,

38:19.799 --> 38:21.509
I just wanna know what
the [bleep] is going on,

38:21.551 --> 38:23.219
why there's so much bullsh--
and animosity going on?

38:23.261 --> 38:24.846
-That's Malia right there.
-Malia...

38:24.888 --> 38:26.556
You and I had a problem
before we came out,

38:26.598 --> 38:28.558
and then you said really
inappropriate things to Lloyd.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.101
I'm ----ing inappropriate?

38:30.143 --> 38:32.771
But I feel as if you're
being inappropriate as [bleep].

38:32.812 --> 38:34.898
I'm not the one that
was offended, Lexi.

38:34.939 --> 38:35.899
You were ----ing--

38:35.940 --> 38:37.108
[overlapping dialogue]

38:37.150 --> 38:38.818
Back up, back up.

38:39.819 --> 38:41.112
Can you speak, Malia?

38:41.154 --> 38:42.113
-Oh my God.
-Shut up.

38:42.155 --> 38:43.531
-Kiss ass.
-Me?

38:43.573 --> 38:44.908
And your fake-ass [bleep].

38:44.949 --> 38:46.618
It ain't worth nothing, bruv.

38:46.659 --> 38:48.161
-Lexi...
-Katie, shut the [bleep] up.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.788
Look at you!

38:49.829 --> 38:51.122
That's your chief stew,
you [bleep].

38:51.164 --> 38:52.832
Shut the [bleep] up.

38:54.167 --> 38:55.919
[snoring]

38:55.960 --> 38:56.920
[bleep].

38:56.961 --> 38:58.630
Malia was a ----ing bitch to me.

38:58.672 --> 39:00.715
[bleep] shut the [bleep].
Put your tit away!

39:00.757 --> 39:02.175
You're being a fake-ass [bleep].

39:02.217 --> 39:05.011
You want me to be a ----ing
bitch, I can be a bitch.

39:12.644 --> 39:12.894
Lexi...

39:14.604 --> 39:15.563
-Katie, shut the [bleep] up.
-Shut the [bleep] up.

39:15.605 --> 39:16.773
[bleep]

39:16.815 --> 39:18.733
Malia was a ----ing
bitch to me.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.110
[bleep] shut the [bleep].
Put your tit away!

39:20.151 --> 39:22.612
You're being a fake-ass [bleep].

39:22.654 --> 39:25.490
You want me to be a ----ing
bitch, I can be a bitch.

39:25.532 --> 39:27.075
Clearly.

39:28.618 --> 39:30.662
-Like, go to bed.
-Okay.

39:30.704 --> 39:32.997
-Lexi.
-What?

39:33.039 --> 39:34.082
Courtney, you had my back.

39:34.124 --> 39:35.125
Yeah, babe...

39:35.166 --> 39:36.793
You understand what's happening.

39:36.835 --> 39:38.169
I got your back, don't worry.

39:38.211 --> 39:39.963
You're just deck crew.

39:40.005 --> 39:41.631
Katie thinks I'm in the wrong.

39:41.673 --> 39:42.966
-No...
-You don't understand.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.884
Are you gonna listen to me?

39:44.926 --> 39:46.970
If you [bleep] up,
it's on me!

39:47.012 --> 39:48.847
When you lash out at another...

39:50.181 --> 39:51.141
No, I know, I know, I know.

39:51.182 --> 39:52.517
I live with her.

39:52.559 --> 39:54.769
I will swap cabins if it
makes it easier.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.938
But I need to know what
the [bleep] happened.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.649
Why are you crying?

39:59.691 --> 40:02.193
We're just deckies!

40:02.235 --> 40:03.570
Yeah, [bleep] us, right?

40:03.611 --> 40:04.946
You're just a deckie.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.282
-All right.
-You ain't worth [bleep].

40:07.323 --> 40:10.660
I'm not about to let her drown
in the hot tub on my watch.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.746
So, yeah, get the [bleep]
out of my hot tub.

40:13.872 --> 40:15.081
My head hurts.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.207
I'm, like, normal.

40:16.249 --> 40:18.001
Hey, I'm not angry at you.

40:18.043 --> 40:21.129
I'm just, like, you just
really need to rein it in.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.048
I'm draining the hot tub, so...

40:23.089 --> 40:24.549
-Okay.
-Yeah, can you please...

40:24.591 --> 40:26.009
Get out.

40:26.051 --> 40:27.010
No, I don't care.

40:27.052 --> 40:28.345
If she's being mean...

40:28.386 --> 40:29.846
I don't let
people disrespect me.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.181
No, no, no, I get that.

40:31.222 --> 40:32.265
No, of course, I completely
understand.

40:32.307 --> 40:33.266
She needs to give you respect.

40:33.308 --> 40:34.642
Just... just stop talking.

40:34.684 --> 40:35.685
Okay, I'll stop talking.

40:35.727 --> 40:37.145
Get the [bleep] off the deck.

40:37.187 --> 40:38.313
No, don't say that.

40:38.355 --> 40:39.981
Okay, shut the [bleep] up.

40:40.023 --> 40:41.691
No, she's saying
"get the [bleep] off the deck."

40:41.733 --> 40:42.692
-Don't...
-I know, I know.

40:42.734 --> 40:43.693
Stop fighting!

40:43.735 --> 40:45.612
Suck my dick.

40:45.653 --> 40:46.905
No, don't say, "Get the [bleep]
off the deck," because then...

40:46.946 --> 40:48.698
I will say get the [bleep].

40:48.740 --> 40:50.617
No, Lexi, my...

40:50.658 --> 40:51.618
Who the [bleep] are you?

40:51.659 --> 40:52.619
Enjoy the hot tub.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.705
You're a ----ing bosun.

40:55.747 --> 40:56.748
-Shut.
-Enjoy the hot tub.

40:56.790 --> 40:57.791
You're the ----ing bosun, bitch.

40:57.832 --> 40:59.209
Go on, then, enjoy the hot tub.

40:59.250 --> 41:02.671
You're a ----ing bosun,
stand the [bleep] down.

41:02.712 --> 41:04.589
Get out. Okay?
Get out, get out, get out.

41:04.631 --> 41:05.882
[bleep] off, bitch.

41:05.924 --> 41:06.883
Get out.

41:06.925 --> 41:07.884
I will [bleep] you up.

41:07.926 --> 41:09.386
Go to bed!
Go to bed.

41:09.427 --> 41:11.221
You're supposed to be
a ----ing chief stew.

41:13.682 --> 41:14.724
Am I? Okay.

41:14.766 --> 41:15.767
[bleep] off, bitch.

41:17.894 --> 41:21.398
I am not thrilled.
Yeah.

41:21.439 --> 41:22.982
She's a sh-- human.

41:23.024 --> 41:24.234
I know she's going
through a hard time.

41:24.275 --> 41:25.694
You know, she's just
lost her father,

41:25.735 --> 41:27.987
so I am really
empathetic towards that.

41:28.029 --> 41:30.281
Does that excuse your behavior?
Absolutely not.

41:30.323 --> 41:31.741
I've never...

41:31.783 --> 41:32.992
She's offended just
about everyone.

41:33.034 --> 41:34.119
----ing bitch.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.787
Owie.

41:35.829 --> 41:37.789
I'll tell you who's not
sharing a cabin tonight.

41:37.831 --> 41:39.791
-Who?
-Those two.

41:43.086 --> 41:44.295
Malia had your back, and...

41:44.337 --> 41:45.338
The other one didn't.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.007
Things just went to sh--.

41:47.048 --> 41:51.011
The people whose opinion I care
about is the deck team,

41:51.052 --> 41:52.929
so Lexi...

41:52.971 --> 41:53.972
I really
couldn't give a sh--.

42:00.311 --> 42:03.356
Everything was working so good.

42:03.398 --> 42:05.692
Oh [bleep].

42:05.734 --> 42:08.695
-Court? Court?
-Yeah?

42:08.737 --> 42:09.738
Are you all right?

42:09.779 --> 42:10.864
Yeah.

42:10.905 --> 42:12.032
What's wrong?

42:12.073 --> 42:13.825
Oh, God.

42:13.867 --> 42:15.118
There's so much sh--
going on, and everyone's...

42:15.160 --> 42:16.995
-I know, and...
-...crying,

42:24.336 --> 42:25.670
She's a [bleep].

42:25.712 --> 42:26.796
She is...

42:30.050 --> 42:31.176
You're amazing.

42:31.217 --> 42:32.969
I hate it.

42:33.011 --> 42:34.721
Like, and she's my roommate.

42:38.183 --> 42:39.684
Mm.

42:39.726 --> 42:41.394
I don't like how she spoke
to everyone.

42:41.436 --> 42:45.315
No, and the fact you defended
everyone is ----ing amen to you.

42:45.357 --> 42:47.359
Ugh!

42:47.400 --> 42:49.444
[belches]

42:49.486 --> 42:50.445
Lovely.

42:50.487 --> 42:52.072
Thank you so much.

42:52.113 --> 42:54.157
Love you.

42:54.199 --> 42:56.701
I'm naked, so I can't move.

42:56.743 --> 42:58.078
I hate this side of yachting.

42:58.119 --> 42:59.913
-I know.
-Ugh.

43:04.751 --> 43:05.710
I'm sorry tonight was sh--.

43:05.752 --> 43:06.753
Why are you sorry?

43:06.795 --> 43:08.171
Because I hate that.

43:08.213 --> 43:09.714
Tonight wasn't sh--,
tonight was amazing.

43:09.756 --> 43:11.299
Z, I like that your
board shorts are pears.

43:13.051 --> 43:15.720
You are like every
Miami pimp that ever lived.

43:17.347 --> 43:18.848
David, you're so wack.

43:18.890 --> 43:20.225
You're funny, ain't ya?

43:20.266 --> 43:22.060
Hashtag unemployable.

43:22.102 --> 43:23.520
No, I'm employable because
I have more money than you.

43:23.561 --> 43:25.021
-Do you?
-Go ahead.

43:25.063 --> 43:26.189
Don't...
we're enjoying our tea...

43:26.231 --> 43:27.315
You're wack as [bleep].

43:27.357 --> 43:28.775
Don't, don't, don't.

43:28.817 --> 43:30.860
Thank you, sweetheart,
appreciate it.

43:30.902 --> 43:31.861
Don't, don't, don't stoop
to that, don't stoop to that.

43:31.903 --> 43:33.446
She is wack as [bleep].

43:33.488 --> 43:35.365
She's, like, "Your dad died,
I feel like so sorry,"

43:35.407 --> 43:36.950
and I can tell she's being fake.

43:36.991 --> 43:38.159
What?

43:38.201 --> 43:39.202
Lexi!

43:39.244 --> 43:40.203
-Whoa, whoa, Lexi.
-Wow.

43:40.245 --> 43:41.788
[bleep] off.

43:41.830 --> 43:43.331
No, you're...
you're taking sh--.

43:44.874 --> 43:45.875
Lexi. Lexi.

43:45.917 --> 43:47.460
You just told me to get ----ed.

43:49.129 --> 43:51.548
No.

43:51.589 --> 43:52.799
Lexi, I think you
need to calm...

43:52.841 --> 43:53.800
She's being fake as [bleep].

43:53.842 --> 43:54.884
No! Z...

43:54.926 --> 43:56.052
No, I'm not being rude to you.

43:58.888 --> 43:59.848
My dad ----ing died.

43:59.889 --> 44:01.099
I understand.

44:01.141 --> 44:02.892
She's like, "I feel
what you feel."

44:02.934 --> 44:04.436
-I don't feel like the...
-She's a fake-ass bitch.

44:04.477 --> 44:05.895
No, she is not a ----ing
fake person, she's been...

44:05.937 --> 44:07.939
Z, stop being a kiss-ass.

44:07.981 --> 44:09.357
You must stop your sh--.

44:09.399 --> 44:11.026
No, you're being a kiss-ass,
[bleep] off.

44:11.067 --> 44:12.068
-Hey!
-Lexi!
