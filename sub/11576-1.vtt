WEBVTT

00:38.164 --> 00:39.574
Oh, boo ya.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.043
Now let's see what
all the fuss is about.

01:01.354 --> 01:03.436
Oh, this is so Raiders.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.271
Here's hoping
this Ark contains less

01:06.484 --> 01:08.349
Nazi face-melting goodness.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.001
Oh, the Una Mens...

01:37.014 --> 01:37.799
(muffled) Oh!

01:38.015 --> 01:39.095
Indeed.

01:39.517 --> 01:40.802
They are coming.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.133
And they will be hungry.

01:42.353 --> 01:42.978
(muffled) Ahhhhh!

01:43.187 --> 01:44.802
Let me go, zombie boy!

01:45.022 --> 01:46.637
Whicher, hold on.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.600
She is claimed.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.106
Yet dares to
defile the blood laws.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.108
She will be delivered
by the Una Mens.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.610
And you need to be
delivered to a dentist, buddy.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.943
Your breath smells
like the anus of a yeti.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.948
Bold talk from
the human who attacked

02:02.164 --> 02:02.949
a place of sanctuary.

02:03.165 --> 02:03.950
Whicher,

02:04.166 --> 02:04.951
you're making a mistake.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.452
You should just let her go.

02:06.669 --> 02:10.628
I keep telling
you lam not human.

02:26.022 --> 02:26.852
That's cute.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.929
As you can see,
this one cannot be

02:29.150 --> 02:30.230
the one you're looking for.

02:30.443 --> 02:30.772
She is--

02:30.985 --> 02:32.941
All Fae, baby.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.485
Feel the heat!

02:35.823 --> 02:37.233
How is it possible?

02:38.284 --> 02:39.273
I am mistaken?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.529
Hey, pobody's nerfect.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.452
We'll get her out
of here, your emissary.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.280
The next time | see this
one, her skin will line

02:46.500 --> 02:48.286
the Una Mens Holy chambers.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.302
I totally had him.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.223
Let's go.

03:05.436 --> 03:06.972
Thanks, Detective Do-Nothings.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.769
What, you couldn't
have whomped his ass

03:08.981 --> 03:10.016
with your massive wolf paws?

03:10.232 --> 03:11.768
What, and miss the show?

03:11.984 --> 03:12.769
Nice work, Sparky.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.020
That was too close, Kenz.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.067
These temporary powers
are not a good idea.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.110
Yeah, but necessary,

03:17.323 --> 03:18.608
because I'm a
terrorist, remember?

03:18.824 --> 03:21.440
You terrorists all smell like
sunflowers and Chardonnay?

03:23.162 --> 03:25.118
Okay, I'm gonna take
Tinkerbell home, all right?

03:25.331 --> 03:26.286
Yep.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.457
After you.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.621
I'll go do the paperwork.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.459
Sunflowers?

03:29.668 --> 03:30.373
Nice.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.797
(sniffing)

03:37.009 --> 03:38.089
No one's here, Dyson.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.587
Stop sniffing.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.629
Just you, me and the,
uh, thongs, huh?

03:44.016 --> 03:44.971
Hm.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.140
That's a whole lot
of thongs, by the way.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.685
Well, I will have you
know, that these are all

03:49.897 --> 03:51.182
business thongs.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.270
I don't even want to
know what that means.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.778
I can see why you need
all this stuff, though.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.950
Sorta fills
the place up a bit.

04:07.498 --> 04:08.783
Well, I am not lonely,

04:08.999 --> 04:12.127
if that is what
you're asking, wolfie.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.547
I wasn't, actually.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.296
Why would you be
lonely with me here?

04:26.350 --> 04:30.810
That is a very...
good question...

05:00.009 --> 05:00.998
Shit--

05:02.178 --> 05:03.918
Are all wolves
this romantic?

05:04.138 --> 05:06.299
I'm just thinking
about Hale, |--

05:07.516 --> 05:09.131
That's very
open-minded of you.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.888
He's crazy about you, right?

05:13.856 --> 05:16.472
Since when are we... this?

05:17.151 --> 05:18.106
(knocking on door)

05:19.987 --> 05:21.727
More Council douche-hats.

05:22.323 --> 05:24.939
No, smells a little too, uh...

05:25.659 --> 05:26.614
pleasant.

05:30.331 --> 05:30.945
Hello.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.706
Please!

05:33.918 --> 05:36.455
I need to speak with the
talented private investigater.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.955
My name is Aife.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.874
I remember you, lady.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.706
You made Ash who talks
like Batman, go boom.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.466
Oh, suede, in this weather?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.975
You beautiful badass.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.310
Let her go.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.097
Look, I'm not here to fight.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.182
I need help
finding my daughter.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.730
Her name is Bo.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.069
Bo.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.616
Kind of a dude's
name, amiright?

06:12.665 --> 06:15.122
Life is hard when you
don 't know who you are.

06:15.668 --> 06:18.000
It's harder when you
don 't know what you are.

06:18.671 --> 06:20.627
My love carries
a death sentence.

06:21.507 --> 06:26.467
I was lost for years.
Searching while hiding.

06:26.679 --> 06:29.762
Only to find that l belonged
to a world hidden from humans.

06:30.683 --> 06:32.139
I won 't hide anymore.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.808
I will live the life I choose.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.351
So you are a succubus?

06:43.571 --> 06:44.981
The Succubus who tried

06:45.197 --> 06:47.279
to assassinate
the Light Fae elders.

06:47.491 --> 06:48.606
l was agitated.

06:48.826 --> 06:49.440
And now?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.241
I'm less agitated.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.738
And l have a higher purpose.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.786
To find the
daughter that I lost.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.830
Oh...

07:01.046 --> 07:02.627
We've met before.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.794
You didn't leave
much of an impression.

07:06.010 --> 07:06.874
Ha.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.380
Darling, I've
"met" many men before.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.632
And whatever they claim later

07:10.848 --> 07:12.304
in front of
their lady friends,

07:12.516 --> 07:14.507
they're always impressed.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.058
But I was speaking
more recently.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.556
At Taft's... lab.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.306
That's right, you were there.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.603
So, you have a thirty
year old daughter?

07:26.822 --> 07:29.359
A grown daughter no one
has ever heard of or seen?

07:29.575 --> 07:31.031
It's true, there's no record,

07:31.243 --> 07:33.279
or physical indications
that I ever gave birth.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.031
Though a succubus'
body is her weapon,

07:35.247 --> 07:37.829
so there would be no wear
and tear, so to speak.

07:38.042 --> 07:39.623
Would you like
to see for yourself?

07:39.835 --> 07:40.620
Scanning for stretch marks?

07:40.836 --> 07:41.621
Pass.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.122
I know in my heart

07:43.339 --> 07:45.796
I gave birth to a baby girl.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.966
I know I would have named
her after my own mother.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.463
And I know this is her.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.715
I knew as soon as
I found the photo.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.967
Five bucks says it's
a picture of her cat.

07:55.184 --> 07:56.299
I'm not crazy.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.942
This woman is... beautiful.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.443
Yeah, if you're into,
like, faces and bodies.

08:11.659 --> 08:12.444
Whatever.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.775
We're not interested.

08:13.994 --> 08:14.699
Sorry.

08:14.912 --> 08:15.947
You're skeptical, | get it.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.119
My daddy didn't raise no fool.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.869
That's a recuerdo coil.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.625
That's hard proof that a Fae

08:27.841 --> 08:29.297
has been messing
with her memory.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.966
| just want to know why.

08:32.012 --> 08:32.967
I'll pay,

08:33.180 --> 08:33.635
of course.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.132
I'll pay well.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.634
One daughter,
coming right up.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.387
With, you know,
expenses, naturally.

08:39.603 --> 08:40.638
Naturally.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.105
(phone ringing)

08:45.317 --> 08:46.102
Excuse me.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.433
Wait, now?

08:49.321 --> 08:49.946
Same time.

08:50.155 --> 08:50.905
Every day.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.275
You've been going for a month

08:52.491 --> 08:53.947
and you have found squat.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.114
She rescued me.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.863
Dyson, she drove
you off a cliff.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.115
And I would have died
if I hadn't shifted.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.946
That's why I
need to find Tamsin.

09:01.166 --> 09:01.575
Find out why.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.373
Okay, you owe me
for leaving me alone

09:03.585 --> 09:05.496
with the client, and the tab.

09:05.838 --> 09:06.452
Good news.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.208
She's gonna take your case.

09:08.424 --> 09:09.630
And you're lucky.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.798
'Cause Kenzi is the best.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.465
I'd like to
get going, as well.

09:15.681 --> 09:16.466
lt's Fleet Week.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.387
Okay.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.634
Can I get you anything else?

09:18.851 --> 09:19.340
Allow me.

09:19.560 --> 09:20.470
Great.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.641
I'm a little short

09:21.854 --> 09:23.810
right now.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.764
Maybe I could
come back sometime,

09:26.984 --> 09:28.269
make it up to you...

09:28.819 --> 09:30.684
God... yes.

09:37.828 --> 09:40.365
Lady, what you need
is some kind of manager.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.002
Ahhhhhh!

09:57.347 --> 09:58.473
New hobby?

09:59.933 --> 10:02.470
Is this because of what
happened between you and Stella?

10:02.770 --> 10:03.475
What?

10:03.687 --> 10:04.312
No.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.636
Nothing happened.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.187
Nothing like
it's just a break

10:07.399 --> 10:08.980
or nothing like
you knocked her up.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.228
Don't touch!

10:10.986 --> 10:12.271
Something's out of step.

10:12.488 --> 10:14.604
Someone's been messing with
the balance of space and time.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.108
My money's on the new Council.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.781
They seem really
easily butt hurt.

10:17.993 --> 10:18.948
Ugh...

10:19.161 --> 10:22.119
The Una Mens are a
near-omniscent council

10:22.331 --> 10:24.617
of Fae authority
whose sole purpose...

10:24.833 --> 10:27.791
...is to ensure the
old laws are followed.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.038
Uh huh.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.506
What's with the seed?

10:36.011 --> 10:37.797
It's a symbol of the Una Mens.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.129
They're descending on
our little "colony" because

10:40.349 --> 10:42.806
things have gotten real
messy in the past few years.

10:43.519 --> 10:45.134
I blame Bieber Fever.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.525
They, um, wouldn't do...

10:50.734 --> 10:52.270
memory loss, would they?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.522
No, the Una Mens
would never stoop

10:54.738 --> 10:57.354
to something so... subtle.

10:57.574 --> 10:58.359
Wait--

10:58.992 --> 10:59.777
Why?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.153
Oh, uh, new client.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.032
I need a beat on the local
Fae that can cause amnesia.

11:04.248 --> 11:04.953
Amnesia?

11:05.165 --> 11:05.950
Mmhmm.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.288
Uh huh...

11:11.505 --> 11:12.790
Dr. Snook.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.122
He's an ortenax; fish Fae;

11:15.342 --> 11:16.798
feeds off memories.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.625
Moonlights as an eye doc.

11:19.012 --> 11:19.797
Trout-tometrist.

11:20.013 --> 11:20.968
Got it!

11:21.431 --> 11:23.968
Speaking of doctors,
any word on Lauren?

11:27.187 --> 11:30.930
She tricked Taft during surgery,
after disobeying the Ash.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.774
She saved Dyson's life.

11:34.987 --> 11:38.946
It's always been difficult to
know what makes Dr. Lewis tick.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.615
That's because
she's... awkward,

11:42.828 --> 11:44.944
and formal and shy.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.788
The love of her life is dead.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.787
Lauren lost Nadia,
then had to keep working

11:51.003 --> 11:52.459
for the people
who killed her.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.955
Anyway, she's the only
other human ally I've got.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.337
Even though I'm
barely human these days.

12:00.554 --> 12:01.964
We have people
looking for her.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.465
(scoffing) Yeah.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.974
I've heard that
one before, Gramps.

12:08.020 --> 12:08.805
Trickster.

12:09.021 --> 12:09.976
Trick.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.436
Sir.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.274
Thank you.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.441
For this--

12:18.155 --> 12:19.770
Just be careful out there!

12:23.577 --> 12:25.613
Evil comes in many faces.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.171
I'm seeing lots
of Gucci and Prada...

12:38.383 --> 12:39.008
Uh huh...

12:39.217 --> 12:40.878
Dermabrasions, botox.

12:41.094 --> 12:41.628
Mmhmm.

12:41.845 --> 12:42.800
Hello!

12:43.013 --> 12:43.968
Janet!

12:45.974 --> 12:47.760
Janet, is the doc in?

12:47.976 --> 12:49.261
We need to see him.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.762
Now, with a smile like
that, you could talk me

12:52.773 --> 12:55.480
into your bed, but
not through those doors.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.941
Now, skedaddle before
I call the cops.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.102
The real cops.

13:00.322 --> 13:01.357
Or--

13:01.573 --> 13:02.688
Or...

13:03.992 --> 13:05.948
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, okay!

13:07.663 --> 13:08.277
Sit.

13:08.497 --> 13:08.952
Stay.

13:09.164 --> 13:09.789
Roll over?

13:09.998 --> 13:11.283
Jeepers Peepers...

13:11.500 --> 13:13.616
You don't have
to fire the Nanny.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.450
The affair never happened.

13:16.505 --> 13:19.793
Your husband was only
helping Olga stretch.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.124
Helping wives forget their
husbands cheated on them?

13:22.344 --> 13:23.459
What a noble calling.

13:23.679 --> 13:24.418
Dr. Snook.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.923
We have some
questions for you.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.221
Seems you've messed with
the wrong people's memory.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.264
We're done here.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.264
Janet, could you,
um, get the, uh, bill?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.435
Come on, darling.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.434
Okay... This way.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.515
Yep, you were great.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.271
This way... okay.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.272
Oh, look at you...

13:41.488 --> 13:42.603
Nice one, buddy.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.276
As for you curious
carps, l'm, um--

13:45.492 --> 13:46.607
Hey, hey!

13:46.827 --> 13:47.612
Snook, chill.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.614
Just want to ask
you a few questions.

13:49.830 --> 13:50.660
No, no, sorry.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.783
Snook only does
memory extractions.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.456
He does not restore them.

13:54.668 --> 13:58.786
Although, that is
some beautiful work...

13:59.006 --> 14:00.121
What are you talking about?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.590
I guess we forgot.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.099
Oh...

14:13.311 --> 14:16.439
As expected, the shifter
does have a recuerdo coil.

14:16.648 --> 14:20.607
But like Snook explained,
this is not my work.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.441
Okay.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.610
Okay, so what you're
saying is somebody's

14:24.823 --> 14:26.609
been in here
extracting our memories?

14:26.825 --> 14:27.610
Mmhmm.

14:27.826 --> 14:28.941
This is very disturbing.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.571
Yeah, you're telling me.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.742
I could be famous.

14:31.955 --> 14:32.580
(gaSP)

14:32.789 --> 14:34.450
I could be a Kardashian?

14:34.666 --> 14:35.621
You could be shy.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.118
Who has the
power to cause amnesia,

14:40.338 --> 14:41.794
in both humans and Fae?

14:42.007 --> 14:43.963
Someone very talented

14:44.176 --> 14:47.714
and someone infinitely
more powerful than Snook.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.006
A memory spell
of this magnitude,

14:53.226 --> 14:56.263
you'd need to find and
shatter the recuerdo compass.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.765
Wicked. Vault it to me.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.267
Ebay?

15:00.484 --> 15:01.599
Fae-jiji?

15:02.986 --> 15:05.102
The compass was lost
off the shore of Madagascar

15:05.322 --> 15:07.278
when the Esme
Fierce ran aground.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.606
Ooh, burn.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.192
But rumor has it,

15:12.412 --> 15:14.789
that someone's paid
quite a bit of money

15:14.998 --> 15:16.784
to have it salvaged.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.455
Nice save!

15:17.667 --> 15:18.793
So who's got it?

15:19.503 --> 15:20.117
Engelram.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.452
The Collector.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.290
Last-bash-before-the-Una Mens

15:23.507 --> 15:26.123
permanently-party-poops-
all-over-this town Engelram?

15:27.010 --> 15:27.635
Yes...?

15:27.844 --> 15:28.799
Ugh!

15:30.138 --> 15:31.753
I hear he keeps his gallery
of antique-y Fae swag

15:31.973 --> 15:33.258
well under lock and key.

15:35.310 --> 15:38.268
What, I keep tabs
on wealthy Fae dealings.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.686
For my science.

15:39.981 --> 15:40.606
Mmm--

15:41.900 --> 15:44.767
But just in case, I will
tell Dyson to score us

15:44.986 --> 15:47.773
two tickets to this
loser recluse's shit show.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.355
Not a fan of a
nice strawberry social?

15:50.575 --> 15:51.530
With the Fae?

15:52.661 --> 15:54.117
Watching them dance and drink,

15:54.329 --> 15:55.865
knowing that
they feed on my kind?

15:56.081 --> 15:57.196
That their whole
Dark/Light system

15:57.415 --> 15:59.030
is completely hypocritical?

16:00.001 --> 16:01.286
No, thank you.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.451
You get to wear a pretty dress.

16:04.881 --> 16:05.461
I gotta jet.

16:05.674 --> 16:06.459
Thanks for the Oolong.

16:06.675 --> 16:07.460
Um...

16:07.676 --> 16:08.631
Aren't you
forgetting something?

16:08.844 --> 16:10.505
We are all
forgetting something.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.802
My kingmoor ring?

16:25.318 --> 16:26.273
Thank you.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.601
Anything else?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.944
My Lass of the Summer's
Eve collector's item!

16:38.540 --> 16:40.622
You know they only made
a thousand of these?

16:40.834 --> 16:41.914
Girl's gotta eat.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.716
What's this?

16:57.642 --> 16:58.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--

16:58.476 --> 16:59.682
Are you okay?

17:01.479 --> 17:03.686
Tell me everything you
know about your client.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.942
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not angry, darling,

17:13.158 --> 17:15.444
l'm genuinely intrigued.

17:16.494 --> 17:20.612
When I say, "design
me one last costume

17:20.832 --> 17:22.788
befitting the
new Dark Fae leader",

17:23.001 --> 17:24.457
why do you hear,

17:24.669 --> 17:26.785
"dress me like
an asexual hobo"?

17:28.757 --> 17:32.921
l-l-du-du-do hope you
realize Engelram's party

17:33.136 --> 17:35.502
is the event of the season,

17:35.722 --> 17:38.680
and my last chance
to get the freak on.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.507
Before the Council arrive,

17:40.727 --> 17:42.467
to put the
moratorium on all fun.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.224
Fun like this, for example--

17:46.149 --> 17:50.438
(whimpering)

17:50.654 --> 17:51.609
Vex!

17:53.156 --> 17:55.943
You got no authority
here, Marmaduke.

17:56.159 --> 17:56.989
Authority?

17:57.202 --> 17:58.988
All | see is a
bully taking out

17:59.204 --> 18:00.660
his Mommy issues on the help.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.617
(laughing)

18:03.833 --> 18:05.789
You can't stop me
from shifting, Vex.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.117
And once I'm a wolf,

18:07.337 --> 18:08.918
I'm going straight
for your throat.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.746
Yeah, well, I'm as stubborn
as I am well endowed.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.424
And I do love a
good Mexican Standoff.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.258
Ole.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.757
Nice picture, by the way.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.145
Yeah, I was as stunned as
anyone to find out she had

18:27.357 --> 18:31.145
named me heir to the
Dark throne, so to speak.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.109
l shed so many tears.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.278
But I had to stay strong.

18:36.491 --> 18:37.697
It's what Miss
Died-on-the-Toilet

18:37.909 --> 18:38.944
would have wanted.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.617
And what would your
predecessor say to you

18:41.830 --> 18:43.445
giving your
Light Fae enemies

18:43.665 --> 18:45.701
tickets to the
Collector's ball tonight?

18:45.917 --> 18:46.622
Hmmmm

18:46.835 --> 18:48.746
Since when have
you liked balls?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.249
We need to get back
something we've lost.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.081
And why the hell
would I help you do that?

18:56.636 --> 18:57.751
Because if you don't,

18:57.971 --> 19:01.589
I may have to tell
the Una Mens that you...

19:01.808 --> 19:05.596
exaggerated the details
of young Evony's demise.

19:06.146 --> 19:06.931
What?!

19:09.816 --> 19:11.681
I can smell
her back there, Vex.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.604
In her little cell.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.276
She died.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.771
Oh, she's rotten, all right,

19:17.991 --> 19:19.447
but she's not rotting.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.075
Not man enough
to finish the job?

19:22.287 --> 19:23.777
You're mental.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.780
It's a shame
about Evony, you know?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.992
She was evil and insane,
but she was a worthy foe.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.794
Ten times the
leader you'll ever be.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.253
The good news is...

19:37.469 --> 19:41.257
you cough up three invitations
to Engelram's little shin dig,

19:41.473 --> 19:43.088
and I won't rat you out.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.260
What do you say?

19:52.984 --> 19:53.939
Cynthia?

19:54.819 --> 19:56.775
Could you provide
Detective Dyson

19:56.988 --> 19:59.604
with our complimentary
party tickets?

20:00.325 --> 20:00.780
Yes!

20:00.992 --> 20:02.277
My tickets!

20:03.453 --> 20:05.239
Looks like I won't
be needing them.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.453
Thanks a bunch, Vex.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.120
Of course, I can't guarantee
that once I get my memory back,

20:11.336 --> 20:13.292
I'll let you keep
this cushy little job.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.749
Or your life.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.753
Stop smiling at me,
you smug bitch.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.551
Ahhhhh!

20:32.148 --> 20:33.763
This used to
be a spirit night.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.268
| used to be the Ash

20:35.485 --> 20:36.520
and now I'm a disgrace.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.272
Don't see me crying...

20:38.488 --> 20:39.568
in public.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.188
Lot of ladies shaking
their, uh... baby grands.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.273
Not that l mind...

20:43.493 --> 20:45.449
Yeah, well...

20:45.662 --> 20:47.448
Every year,
one girl gets chosen

20:47.664 --> 20:49.325
to meet the elusive collector.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.289
Elusive, as in, filthy rich.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.617
It's not the money,
or his collection

20:53.837 --> 20:55.293
of priceless Fae memorabilia.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.461
Engelram's amphisbaena.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.584
A wish granter?

20:59.801 --> 21:01.007
Yep.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.505
So some lucky lady gets
her deepest desires granted.

21:03.721 --> 21:04.255
That's nice.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.257
(sigh)

21:05.473 --> 21:07.088
| wish my lady would get here.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.262
Toe cleavage?

21:14.983 --> 21:16.098
Real cleavage?

21:33.168 --> 21:34.123
Holla!

21:35.170 --> 21:36.285
lt's Kenzi.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.086
Uh...

21:39.299 --> 21:43.918
I know we weren't
always... copacetic.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.253
But I could use
your nerdy hypothesis

21:46.473 --> 21:48.429
on some color
blocking right now.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.928
And, um...

21:52.145 --> 21:54.306
| just hope you're... safe.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.601
So...

21:57.817 --> 22:00.433
you know, if you get this,
call me, call me back...

22:00.653 --> 22:01.608
Lauren.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.362
Okay, bye.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.503
You better be here
to advise on accessories.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.216
My new toy.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.464
You want a closer look?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.669
What am I saying?

22:28.890 --> 22:30.755
Girls like you always
want a closer look.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.090
What took you so long?

22:32.310 --> 22:33.925
I called you,
like, an hour ago.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.260
This stuff
doesn't whip itself.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.597
Come to think
of it, neither do |.

22:38.816 --> 22:39.942
Give it to me.

22:43.321 --> 22:44.561
Wooo...

22:44.989 --> 22:46.604
Spark extract,

22:46.824 --> 22:49.782
mined straight from
the genitals of a sprite.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.950
Ya, don't oversell it.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.583
You better let a
professional handle this.

23:16.813 --> 23:17.677
Mmmmm

23:24.153 --> 23:25.108
That's it?

23:26.614 --> 23:28.775
You're already on the books
for your last two visits.

23:28.992 --> 23:29.947
Noted.

23:30.326 --> 23:34.740
Of course if cash
flow is a problem,

23:34.956 --> 23:37.572
there are always
other ways to pay.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.077
You didn't make me Fae.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.629
You tricked me.

23:44.841 --> 23:47.423
Now, I'm just a hot human sheep
in twinkly fairy clothing.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.012
So shed my brilliantly
concocted disguise

23:50.221 --> 23:51.597
and see what
happens when the Council

23:51.806 --> 23:53.091
comes knocking on your door.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.220
Massimo, please.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.511
I'll get your money.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.273
Good.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.616
Or next time...

24:10.825 --> 24:13.032
I'll show up with
something with teeth.

24:22.295 --> 24:23.751
Maybe I should
interrogate that one?

24:23.963 --> 24:24.952
What do you say?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.755
You certainly got a type.

24:34.098 --> 24:34.883
Kenzi.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.263
Kenzi?

24:41.314 --> 24:42.269
Oh, my god.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.107
Hi. Hi.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.604
What do you think?

24:47.820 --> 24:48.809
I think you're late.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.191
And Engelram already
has his eye on a favorite.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.439
I can still get the compass.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.775
Get his attention.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.780
Got my attention.

24:57.955 --> 24:59.991
Look, I'm just saying
you don't bring a wolf

25:00.208 --> 25:01.323
to guard the sheep.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.328
What does that mean?

25:03.961 --> 25:04.996
You see those two?

25:05.213 --> 25:06.999
They've been on the
cover of Sports Illustrated.

25:07.590 --> 25:08.625
I like sports.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.923
I'm just saying that
despite your many talents,

25:11.135 --> 25:13.751
maybe this is a little outside
of your area of expertise.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.508
I mean, we need
a killer kiss here.

25:16.724 --> 25:17.804
I will have you know

25:18.017 --> 25:20.724
that l have seduced
many a rich-dork before.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.267
I think.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.604
Okay, do you want to
get our memories back or not?

25:25.817 --> 25:27.432
And forget this magic moment?

25:31.489 --> 25:33.605
You wanna see my "skill set"?

25:33.825 --> 25:34.610
Fine.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.362
I hope you stretched.

25:41.457 --> 25:42.321
Hi!

25:43.292 --> 25:44.998
Can you buy me a free drink?

25:53.553 --> 25:54.918
Déja vu.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.253
No, I'm Clio.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.929
Déja vu came down
with a case of the crabs.

25:59.142 --> 25:59.597
Charming.

25:59.809 --> 26:00.594
(gaSP)

26:00.810 --> 26:01.925
Oh, my god...

26:02.812 --> 26:04.268
I know you.

26:05.648 --> 26:06.273
Wow...

26:06.482 --> 26:07.938
You're a cop.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.436
Whatever this is?

26:09.652 --> 26:10.607
I'm not interested.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.936
lam a nymph.

26:13.156 --> 26:14.271
Now I'm really not interested.

26:14.490 --> 26:15.445
Ouch.

26:15.825 --> 26:16.940
Just bad memories, you know?

26:17.160 --> 26:19.276
Tequila-soaked, nakedness.

26:19.495 --> 26:20.905
(laughing)

26:21.122 --> 26:22.737
You know, we're not all bad.

26:22.957 --> 26:26.415
We're just kind
of spawned that way.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.922
One, two, three, four.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.598
One, two, three, four.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.095
One, two, three, four.

26:44.312 --> 26:45.677
Stop counting, Hale.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.103
And hold me closer,
I'm not your Nona.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.103
Stop squirming.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.698
Dammit, act like you
wanna tear my clothes off!

27:03.289 --> 27:04.244
Oh, golly.

27:05.666 --> 27:08.248
That's more awkward than
your attempt at small talk.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.416
I agree.

27:09.629 --> 27:10.334
Excuse me.

27:14.425 --> 27:15.289
I got it, partner.

27:15.510 --> 27:16.590
You really don't.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.470
Who's the brunette?

27:25.686 --> 27:28.098
Would you just shut up
and let me lead for once?

28:47.351 --> 28:48.261
Seriously?

28:55.693 --> 28:57.024
Maybe we have
done this before.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.646
That, I would remember.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.743
(crowd gasping)

29:19.467 --> 29:20.502
The final rose.

29:21.135 --> 29:22.124
How original.

29:25.306 --> 29:27.422
Looks like someone's
going private chambers.

29:34.982 --> 29:37.359
Pirate booty, sure.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.446
Stuffed unicorn...

29:45.326 --> 29:46.281
Why not.

29:48.329 --> 29:49.444
Hello?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.074
(door closing)

29:51.290 --> 29:51.915
(gaSP)

29:54.293 --> 29:55.624
Great door!

29:56.212 --> 29:57.668
Really loud.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.255
And I love all your crates.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.753
Very Pottery Barn.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.091
Is this situation
going Indecent Proposal?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.969
'Cause I'm gonna need to see
the jewels up front, buddy.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.440
Welcome...

30:21.320 --> 30:22.856
...pretty girl.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.273
Mr. Engelram?

30:28.494 --> 30:32.828
At your sssservice.

30:46.512 --> 30:49.629
Please, don't stop
yourselves on my account!

30:50.433 --> 30:54.096
Diddle your souls
while Rome burns.

30:57.732 --> 31:00.348
Make merry while ye may!

31:01.986 --> 31:05.103
For The Una Mens
are on their way!

31:05.489 --> 31:07.775
And I'll be on mine, too!

31:07.992 --> 31:10.278
As soon as you
cough up what I,

31:10.494 --> 31:13.110
the venerable leader
of the Dark, want.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.408
And what I want,

31:15.624 --> 31:16.579
is the Wolf.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.083
Owwwwww!

31:22.465 --> 31:24.751
I can get you out
of here for a price.

31:24.967 --> 31:27.754
I think I'd rather stay.
Rip his throat out.

31:28.095 --> 31:31.178
The Morrigan and
a mesmer? Seriously?

31:31.390 --> 31:32.675
Do you know how to rappel?

31:32.892 --> 31:35.258
Why, you got some rope
in that itty bitty dress?

31:35.478 --> 31:36.558
VEX: Do I have
to do everything

31:36.771 --> 31:37.931
myself?

31:39.148 --> 31:40.979
(crowd screaming)

31:41.192 --> 31:42.773
Oh, Snook.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.105
Oh, you're
on your own, Wolf.

31:49.658 --> 31:50.989
What are you?

31:51.994 --> 31:56.988
I am a humble gatherer
of Fae memorabilia.

31:57.208 --> 32:00.575
A big fan of your dancing...

32:00.961 --> 32:06.501
And I am Amphisbaena.

32:07.635 --> 32:09.717
Slow your roll, Slytherin.

32:10.304 --> 32:13.762
I merely want to look inside.

32:13.974 --> 32:17.967
So I may grant
your unspoken wish.

32:18.187 --> 32:19.597
No need, I'll speak it.

32:19.814 --> 32:23.022
I want the
Ricardo Montalban...

32:23.234 --> 32:24.019
Ricky Martin...

32:24.235 --> 32:26.851
Uh, the, the Compass thing-y.

32:27.488 --> 32:28.603
That's it?

32:29.156 --> 32:29.941
Well...

32:30.157 --> 32:31.237
I'll take your unicorn too,

32:31.450 --> 32:32.610
if you're looking to downsize.

32:32.827 --> 32:35.534
Just when it comes
to unlimited wishes,

32:35.746 --> 32:38.909
you kind of
landed on shallow.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.160
Well, you're one to talk.

32:40.376 --> 32:43.459
Like those toddler-esque
pores happen au natural.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.411
Now, now.

32:45.631 --> 32:51.592
I simply shed my
skin every two months.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.760
That is so unfair.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.588
You could try...

32:55.808 --> 33:00.427
removing your makeup
before you pass out

33:00.646 --> 33:03.763
atop your midnight
helping of cheese popcorn

33:03.983 --> 33:05.598
and vodka.

33:05.818 --> 33:06.933
Me-ow.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.943
Back to the task at hand?

33:10.990 --> 33:12.776
Right. Sorry.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.109
I merely thought the
little human would wish

33:16.328 --> 33:18.159
for her return.

33:20.958 --> 33:21.913
No.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.450
Also, what?

33:25.796 --> 33:26.421
(snap)

33:29.967 --> 33:30.922
Pity.

33:32.094 --> 33:35.257
You don't know
what you're misssssing.

33:35.806 --> 33:37.842
I know I'd like
to get out of here

33:38.058 --> 33:39.594
before you
swallow me whole, so--

33:39.810 --> 33:40.765
Thank you.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.769
You called me human.

33:44.982 --> 33:48.099
I should have
realized it ssssooner.

33:48.319 --> 33:53.689
There was something so
vulnerable about your tango...

33:54.158 --> 33:55.944
Oh, Cobra Commander.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.775
I granted your wish,

33:57.995 --> 34:03.115
now I am going
to swallow you whole.

34:03.459 --> 34:07.077
Isn't that a fair trade?

34:11.133 --> 34:12.839
Nice costume, Vex.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.042
Weren't you the
impotent dick last year?

34:15.262 --> 34:16.422
(chuckling)

34:16.639 --> 34:18.925
Well, now it's time to
see who really is the bitch.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.756
And who's just dead.

34:23.479 --> 34:25.185
Did you come all
the way down here just

34:25.397 --> 34:26.933
to show me your
pretty new shoes?

34:27.149 --> 34:29.105
(chuckling) Hardly.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.149
This is about remembering.

34:31.654 --> 34:34.771
Or, making sure
that no one else does.

34:37.201 --> 34:38.407
Your memory's gone, too.

34:38.619 --> 34:39.449
(chuckling)

34:39.662 --> 34:42.324
I worked it out ages ago.

34:42.539 --> 34:45.076
It's the only thing
that makes sense, really.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.408
This is making
less and less sense.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.249
Do you really think I was
meant to be the Morrigan?

34:53.467 --> 34:55.423
I've never really
had power before.

34:55.636 --> 34:57.251
I mean, not like this.

34:58.305 --> 34:59.260
And what if...

34:59.473 --> 35:02.590
the thing everyone
remembers leads them

35:02.810 --> 35:05.517
to challenge my
hard-fought reign?

35:06.146 --> 35:09.274
I did terrible things
to get my mesmer back.

35:09.483 --> 35:10.768
Even for me.

35:11.485 --> 35:12.941
Cry me a river, Vex.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.734
I still have nightmares
about being helpless.

35:17.950 --> 35:19.565
Unable to influence.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.071
Unable to feed.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.079
But, this...

35:23.289 --> 35:24.244
Hm...

35:24.456 --> 35:26.993
This is about as
good as it gets for me.

35:28.210 --> 35:31.247
And I'm damned if I'm gonna
let Kenzi let everyone else

35:31.463 --> 35:33.840
recall how good it
was to be without me!

35:37.970 --> 35:39.756
How's this
going to work, Vex?

35:39.972 --> 35:41.678
You can't mesmer
me once I shift.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.089
(chuckling)

35:43.309 --> 35:44.549
Yeah, well...

35:44.768 --> 35:47.054
it's a good thing I
can mesmer your mate!

35:48.981 --> 35:49.595
Vex!

35:49.815 --> 35:51.100
Leave her out of this!

35:54.486 --> 35:55.737
Grrrr!

35:55.946 --> 35:57.982
Ahhhhh!

35:58.198 --> 36:00.530
Evan-nescence!

36:01.785 --> 36:02.410
Ahhhh!

36:02.619 --> 36:03.369
Ugh!

36:04.121 --> 36:04.985
(Hale choking)

36:05.205 --> 36:07.617
Since when do
you do the dramatic?

36:09.293 --> 36:10.829
Ahhhhhhh!

36:15.549 --> 36:16.709
You want drama?

36:20.971 --> 36:22.427
I'm gonna end you.

36:25.476 --> 36:26.261
Kenzi: Small crate.

36:26.477 --> 36:28.013
Big crate. Snake man coming.

36:39.615 --> 36:40.400
Come on, Kenzi.

36:40.616 --> 36:41.731
Come on you no friends,

36:41.950 --> 36:43.565
no talent Glow Stick!

36:44.995 --> 36:45.950
Okay...

36:49.458 --> 36:50.083
"Pay me."

36:50.292 --> 36:51.907
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.413
Of all times to
get my human back on!

36:56.131 --> 36:57.086
Ahhhhh!

36:59.635 --> 37:02.968
(struggling)

37:03.180 --> 37:04.966
You fought by our side!

37:06.975 --> 37:07.760
Ahhhhhh!

37:07.976 --> 37:09.056
Guilty!

37:09.269 --> 37:10.429
Ahhhhhh!

37:10.646 --> 37:12.762
You betrayed our
agreement about Evony!

37:13.649 --> 37:14.604
Harder!

37:14.983 --> 37:16.268
Ahhhhh!

37:16.652 --> 37:18.017
You love Kenzi!

37:18.654 --> 37:20.269
How could you
do this to her?!

37:20.489 --> 37:21.729
We all love Kenzi.

37:21.949 --> 37:25.908
Hell, your Alpha Male's
doing her right now-- Ahhh!

37:27.454 --> 37:29.240
Is the former
Ash really going

37:29.456 --> 37:31.071
to kill the current Morrigan?

37:34.294 --> 37:36.250
There's only one
way to find out.

37:36.797 --> 37:39.254
Ahhhhhh!

37:39.967 --> 37:42.424
Ahhhhhh!

37:43.137 --> 37:48.097
Ahhhhh!

37:51.812 --> 37:52.597
(screeching)

37:53.313 --> 37:54.018
(crash)

37:58.652 --> 37:59.402
(screeching)

37:59.611 --> 38:00.145
(crash)

38:03.157 --> 38:03.566
Ah!

38:09.455 --> 38:10.786
Massive Wolf Paws--

38:11.957 --> 38:13.743
Forgot to tell you:
love the hair.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.492
Oh, my...

38:20.132 --> 38:21.668
(screeching)

38:30.976 --> 38:31.931
Aife?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.517
It's been a long time...

38:43.447 --> 38:44.607
Hi, Daddy.

38:50.954 --> 38:51.943
The Compass!

38:53.290 --> 38:54.279
It cracked--

38:54.625 --> 38:55.831
Well, did that do it?

38:56.960 --> 38:58.746
No, you still got canola oil.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.169
Wait--

39:01.381 --> 39:03.337
Maybe we have to align
the needle to the true north.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.505
Roger that.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.466
Kenzi--

39:07.471 --> 39:08.256
What?

39:11.475 --> 39:13.431
You've always
been there for me.

39:13.644 --> 39:15.475
And you for moi.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.685
I would give my life for you.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.726
I'd never desert you.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.314
Maybe Vex is right.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.741
Maybe this is
as good as it gets.

39:30.953 --> 39:32.068
Maybe...

39:34.623 --> 39:36.329
Maybe we can make it better.

39:44.967 --> 39:48.255
have, like, eighty thongs.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.264
Well, that's great.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.592
I mean--

39:53.809 --> 39:56.095
lam... lonely.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.927
And this for...

39:59.648 --> 40:01.934
All of it, it isn't right.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.765
It hasn't been for awhile.

40:05.946 --> 40:09.564
And m-- My heart hurts...

40:09.783 --> 40:11.774
Dyson, and I don't know why.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.739
Besides...

40:18.959 --> 40:20.574
when you're in love, you know.

40:22.129 --> 40:22.993
Right?

40:26.216 --> 40:27.296
Yeah.

40:30.804 --> 40:31.759
Whatever happens, though,

40:31.972 --> 40:33.883
you and me, we're
in it together, right?

40:34.641 --> 40:35.756
Yes.

40:36.143 --> 40:37.098
Friends 'til the end.

40:37.311 --> 40:38.096
Bros before hoes.

40:38.312 --> 40:39.097
Pals at the Dal--

40:39.313 --> 40:40.519
Yeah, all that.

40:41.315 --> 40:42.179
Yeah.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.646
Gimme that.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.072
(Compass clicking)

40:57.289 --> 40:58.404
(gasping)

40:58.624 --> 40:59.079
Ugh--

40:59.291 --> 40:59.996
Ugh!

41:00.208 --> 41:09.583
g3

41:09.801 --> 41:11.462
Both: Bo...

41:14.473 --> 41:15.383
Ugh!

41:15.599 --> 41:16.714
Grrrrr!

41:17.476 --> 41:18.511
No.

41:18.727 --> 41:20.763
:2

41:20.979 --> 41:22.594
Hi--

41:22.814 --> 41:23.929
Daddy.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.810
Aife...

41:27.152 --> 41:28.107
Aife...

41:28.320 --> 41:29.070
Please...

41:29.279 --> 41:31.065
It's all that I have left.

41:31.281 --> 41:32.737
It's all that's kept me alive

41:32.949 --> 41:34.735
is my hate!

41:34.951 --> 41:37.738
Knowing one day we
would have our reunion.

41:37.954 --> 41:41.572
And it would end in you
spilling your cursed blood.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.334
I'll find her for us.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.374
Ahhhhhh!

41:46.129 --> 41:47.744
This is for her.

41:50.967 --> 41:51.422
Hale--

41:51.968 --> 41:53.003
Hale, are you okay?

41:53.220 --> 41:54.255
Oh, he's fine.

41:54.471 --> 41:55.756
Very effective.

41:55.972 --> 41:57.428
Splendid siren-ing.

41:57.641 --> 42:01.008
You know, I'm glad you didn't
get bitten by the snake, Kenz.

42:01.228 --> 42:02.434
And I gotta tell you,

42:02.646 --> 42:04.853
I love what you're doing
with your mascara these days.

42:05.065 --> 42:05.645
I do, too.

42:05.857 --> 42:06.437
I'm so sorry.

42:06.650 --> 42:06.888
No, stop.

42:07.109 --> 42:08.724
Stop, we're going to find her.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.480
How long has
she even been missing?

42:10.696 --> 42:12.561
Where do we even start?

42:13.490 --> 42:14.821
By finding whomever
could have erased

42:15.033 --> 42:16.864
the memory of the
one we love most.

42:17.077 --> 42:18.658
Oh, you'll regret it.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.577
There lies
some old, wild magiks.

42:21.790 --> 42:23.246
(phone ringing)

42:23.458 --> 42:24.083
No, no, no--

42:24.292 --> 42:25.828
No, Dyson, you can't go now!

42:27.295 --> 42:28.831
The last person
to see Bo alive

42:29.047 --> 42:29.957
was Tamsin.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.754
Well, then what
are you waiting for?!

42:31.967 --> 42:33.377
Go, go!

42:33.802 --> 42:34.962
Ugh...

42:35.178 --> 42:36.167
Are you okay?

42:37.305 --> 42:38.135
Kenz...

42:38.348 --> 42:39.758
We need to talk.

42:39.975 --> 42:40.930
Not until she's back.

42:41.143 --> 42:43.429
I can't even... breathe.

42:43.645 --> 42:44.725
I gotta go.

42:44.938 --> 42:46.144
Okay, I gotta go...

42:56.742 --> 43:06.583
(gurgling)

43:06.793 --> 43:12.834
(gurgling)

43:20.474 --> 43:22.385
Bo?

43:22.601 --> 43:25.138
k?

43:25.353 --> 43:26.934
Bo...

43:27.773 --> 43:29.809
Oh...

43:30.025 --> 43:31.390
I remember...
