WEBVTT

00:09.468 --> 00:11.459
(Metal creaking rhythmically)

00:19.562 --> 00:21.473
(Moaning)

00:30.489 --> 00:33.196
You know what they call
my instrument, right?

00:33.326 --> 00:36.659
Huh? Musicians, I mean.

00:37.914 --> 00:41.748
The 'bone. (Grunting)

00:41.876 --> 00:45.164
Oh, yeah, I play the 'bone.

00:46.923 --> 00:48.459
(Laughing)

00:51.719 --> 00:54.051
Hey, tell me something.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.421
How'd you get a FEMA trailer so quick?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.969
Baby, how do you think I got one so quick?

01:12.365 --> 01:14.321
Hey, I got beignets.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.907
- (Child laughs)
— Who you fucking?

01:17.036 --> 01:19.277
— What?
— I ain't playing, Antoine.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.404
I know you fucking
one of them hos at that club.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.326
Desiree, you're wrong.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.916
l was hanging with the cats from the band,
playing cards.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.910
- Damn.
— Don't treat me like I'm stupid

01:28.047 --> 01:29.912
while I'm stuck out here raising your child.

01:30.049 --> 01:33.257
Listen, I'm on Bourbon Street for one
purpose, and that's to make money for us.

01:33.386 --> 01:36.298
I don't wanna be playing
in no tourist—trap titty bar.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.421
— I can't stand that gig.
- Quit, then.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.297
- And do what?
— Play someplace else.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.970
They ain't got shit else out there.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.845
I mean, half the clubs still closed, Desiree.

01:44.981 --> 01:46.812
Boy, if it wasn't for the storm, lwould've...

01:46.941 --> 01:48.852
If it wasn't for the storm, what?

01:50.111 --> 01:51.976
I don't know why you gotta fight all the time.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.445
If it wasn't for the storm
we wouldn't be living together, right?

01:54.573 --> 01:55.699
You'd be at your place?

01:55.825 --> 01:58.157
Me and the baby would be at my mama's?
That's what you mean.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.947
(Mumbling) You...you said it.

02:00.079 --> 02:03.162
Hey, if you don't want us around, we can
go by my mama and 'em in Memphis.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.656
Ain't no thing.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.999
It's up to you. You want us here?

02:07.128 --> 02:10.040
— Yeah, I do!
— You sure?

02:12.883 --> 02:14.794
Girl...

02:14.927 --> 02:16.963
Please.

02:18.514 --> 02:21.301
I couldn't get through this shit without y'all.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.551
Then you need to act like it.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.722
I'm saying, the way we do,

02:28.858 --> 02:31.144
you ain't got reason to even think

02:31.277 --> 02:33.438
about going nowhere else.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.529
(Chuckles, moans)

02:37.658 --> 02:42.493
- Am I lying?
— No, no, you sure ain't.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.828
If you ain't got nothing for me now,

02:44.957 --> 02:46.822
I'm gonna know for sure.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.824
Oh, no, it's all good, girl.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.577
lt's...al| good.

02:51.714 --> 02:54.456
- Oh...
— lt better be good.

02:58.471 --> 03:00.462
(Groans)

04:41.574 --> 04:43.860
(Man) All right, that's enough
out of you, asshole.

04:52.710 --> 04:55.747
— Hey.
— Toni, thank God!

04:55.880 --> 04:57.791
Hey, get ready to sue somebody,

04:57.923 --> 05:00.585
because this is some bullshit.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.254
What happened, Davis?

05:02.386 --> 05:05.549
A violation of my civil rights,
that's what happened.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.639
Look, all I'm doing is standing
with my man Mason

05:08.767 --> 05:10.758
in front of my house, my home, where | live.

05:10.895 --> 05:13.136
— Mm—hm.
— We're talking, holding a couple of beers.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.354
A Jeep rolls up. Louisiana National Guard.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.724
The guy says to us, "Pour those out."

05:17.860 --> 05:22.069
I'm like, "Dude, seriously?
What part of Louisiana are you from?"

05:22.198 --> 05:23.904
I mean, we invented the go cup.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.445
Shit, we invented
the drive—through daiquiri shop.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.784
— They stopped you for open container?
- Look...

05:28.913 --> 05:31.154
That ordinance isn't even
on the books anymore.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.406
You know what it really was, right?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.328
You think the National Guard stops

05:35.461 --> 05:38.874
if it's two white boys on the street
instead of Mason and me?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.543
They jack you up
and let the black guy walk?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.382
That's one hell of a racial profile.

05:44.512 --> 05:49.427
Mm, bet it wasn't Mason who yelled out,
"Go the fuck back to Fallujah."

05:50.309 --> 05:52.721
— Are you drunk or crazy?
— No, I'm pissed off.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.515
For four months I've had
an army of occupation

05:55.648 --> 05:57.184
rolling through my neighborhood.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.352
On the side of the Jeep
it says, "Military Police."

05:59.485 --> 06:02.352
I said to him, "Do I look like
the military to you, motherfucker?

06:02.488 --> 06:05.525
- "You can't police me."
— This town is barely hanging on.

06:05.658 --> 06:07.944
The cops are wound tight.
The guardsmen are on edge.

06:08.077 --> 06:10.409
- You can't push it, all right?
— We're the ones getting pushed.

06:10.538 --> 06:14.531
Davis... You do not motherfuck
the National Guard.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.752
| just want my city back.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.835
(TV chatter)

06:30.683 --> 06:34.471
— Eggs scrambled or fried, Ma?
— Mm, don't fix me anything.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.845
How come? I got grits on.

06:40.442 --> 06:44.230
— Ma, you know what would help me out?
- Hm?

06:44.363 --> 06:48.322
If you could spend some time
in Baton Rouge,

06:48.450 --> 06:50.736
keep an eye on your grandkids.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.030
Got plenty of room at the house up there.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.028
You know I can't go to no Baton Rouge.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.417
Just for a week or two.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.250
Come on, you know
you wanna see Randall and Alcide.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.370
But what if David comes home
and I'm not here?

07:04.049 --> 07:06.540
How he gonna come home?

07:06.677 --> 07:09.168
— Daymo's somewhere locked up.
- Say who?

07:09.305 --> 07:10.920
That lady lawyer?

07:11.056 --> 07:14.969
She ain't done nothing
but take us on a damn goose chase.

07:16.228 --> 07:20.187
Mama, Toni doing what she can do.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.932
I don't believe my son
was in that jail in the first place.

07:23.068 --> 07:27.607
Ma, you saw the picture, remember?

07:27.740 --> 07:30.527
lt could've been somebody
who looked like David.

07:31.744 --> 07:36.033
Let me fix you a plate.
You ought to eat a little bit of something.

07:36.165 --> 07:39.953
— Baton Rouge.
— Ma.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.248
LaDonna,
I don't know where your brother is,

07:43.380 --> 07:46.668
but I do know, wherever he at,
he's thinking about this house

07:46.800 --> 07:48.631
and trying to get back to it.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.594
And you talking about some Baton Rouge.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.555
Now, I'm gonna stay right here.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.095
I'll be here when David come in that door.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.317
- (Helicopter overhead)
- Where you at, Chief?

08:06.445 --> 08:07.935
Hey, bro.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.647
Lights are back on. You know that, right?

08:11.784 --> 08:15.276
Well, some good news for a change, huh?

08:17.748 --> 08:19.329
Obituaries, huh?

08:19.458 --> 08:21.369
Plenty of them since the storm.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.084
You looking for somebody special?

08:24.213 --> 08:27.580
I heard tell a young dude took
a hell of a ass—whooping last week.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.877
Constance Street, I heard.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.501
They say he's still laid up
at University Hospital.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.845
It's a rough world out here.

08:34.973 --> 08:38.557
Me, I try to live by that golden rule.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.390
(Switch clicks)

08:42.523 --> 08:45.686
I'm gonna have to rewire all this.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.734
That boy gonna live?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.979
Up to God, I suppose.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.532
Hey, you cool?

08:56.912 --> 08:59.324
I'm gonna get it done as long as I can.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.999
— Hold it down, then, chief.
- All right, bro.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.459
(Door opens)

09:11.677 --> 09:13.633
— Hey, Harvey.
-Janeﬂe.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.174
What's going on?
You got the check for last month, right?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.763
I did, but I've got some bad news

09:18.892 --> 09:21.224
and I wanted to come by
and tell it to you in person.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.060
- OK.
— l have to put you on week to week.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.054
Three years I've been buying meat from you.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.056
Never late a payment but this one time.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.058
I'm sorry, darlin'. ljust can't carry you.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.483
It's gonna have to be pay as you go,
week to week.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.737
— I'm sorry.
— Hey, Harvey, do me a favor.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.781
Don't spread it around
that I'm in any trouble.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.825
Darlin', how do you think I heard?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.539
(Door opens)

09:47.629 --> 09:49.165
What do I owe?

09:49.298 --> 09:52.256
Oh, just be thankful
I've got a soft spot for musicians.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.591
Come on, Toni, you pro bono'd
my last three arrests.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.962
I gotta pay something.
Not that l have any money.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.761
I'm sort of between jobs right now, but...

10:01.894 --> 10:04.431
Oh! Hey, do you wanna learn the guitar?

10:04.563 --> 10:05.928
Seriously, I could do lessons.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.929
I taught music for three years
at McDonogh 15.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.931
Yeah, until the marijuana charge, anyway.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.775
— Seriously, Toni. Come on, I owe you.
- No takers on guitar.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.521
— My daughter's learning piano, actually.
— There you go!

10:15.657 --> 10:18.945
A rhythm—and—blues intervention.
I can give her lessons.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.284
— You play piano too?
- Some.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.450
Does your daughter
know how to play Tipitina?

10:24.583 --> 10:26.539
Then how can you say
that she's learning piano?

10:26.668 --> 10:30.877
Come on, Toni.
Your child needs to get up into some Fess.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.713
(Men speaking Spanish)

10:33.842 --> 10:36.254
(LaDonna) How long you figure?

10:36.386 --> 10:38.251
I think we can get it done today.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.970
All right, then. About time.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.930
(Honking)

10:44.770 --> 10:48.479
Hey, baby. (Chuckling)

10:48.607 --> 10:50.598
How'd it go?

10:52.110 --> 10:53.486
— Mm.
— Uh...

10:53.612 --> 10:55.728
— Total runaround.
- What?

10:55.864 --> 10:58.697
— They still gotta make a determination.
— Determination?

10:58.826 --> 11:02.114
If it's wind damage, they pay one way.
If it's flood, they pay another.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.952
— lt's confusing as hell.
- Shit.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.823
Four months and them "good hands" people
ain't close to writing a check.

11:06.959 --> 11:09.166
- (Clang)
— But this is happening, huh?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.410
Yeah, finally.

11:11.547 --> 11:14.163
Hey, look, lwanna take you to lunch,

11:14.299 --> 11:16.881
but I gotta get back on the road
before the kids get out of school.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.843
— That's OK. I'll see you Sunday.
- All right.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.681
Hey, Larry? Something else I wanna ask.

11:23.809 --> 11:27.176
You think I could talk
to your brother Bernard,

11:27.312 --> 11:29.769
see if maybe he can find out
where they got Daymo locked up?

11:29.898 --> 11:32.389
Oh, baby, Bernard doesn't
have anything to do with prisons.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.107
But he got connections, right?

11:34.236 --> 11:37.228
I'm getting the feeling
that our lawyer's just running in circles.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.320
Look, if I thought Bernard could help,

11:39.449 --> 11:41.485
I would have suggested it months ago.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.697
Some reason
why I shouldn't talk to your brother?

11:44.830 --> 11:47.196
Nah, I... ljust don't know what he could do.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.197
He's a civil judge.

11:50.711 --> 11:54.624
You know, I've never asked
your family for any kind of favor.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.292
I know how they feel about me.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.632
— Oh, come on, LaDonna.
- No, uh-uh, listen.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.550
Right now I don't give a shit, unless you got
a problem with me talking to your brother.

12:03.682 --> 12:07.220
No. No problem.

12:07.352 --> 12:10.515
— You want me to call him?
- Thank you, baby.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.482
— I hope he can help.
— Me too.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.061
(LaDonna) Mmm.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.324
— See ya.
— I'll see you Sunday.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.532
- You bet.
— (Chuckles)

12:23.660 --> 12:25.867
(Men speaking Spanish, laughing)

12:25.996 --> 12:28.157
Raoul, you better get your ass
back on that roof.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.496
(Engine starts)

12:29.625 --> 12:31.661
(J‘ Music playing over speakers)

12:40.886 --> 12:42.251
Big Chief.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.844
Lorenzo! Come on in here, boy.

12:44.973 --> 12:48.431
I been trying to find you and yours.
Where your father at?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.972
— Big Chief needs his wild man.
— Don't know.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.015
Ain't nobody heard from him
since the storm.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.139
He could be anywhere
in this damn country.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.606
Yeah.

12:56.735 --> 12:59.442
Me, I ended up in Arizona with a friend.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.608
— I kinda like it, actually.
— Arizona?

13:02.741 --> 13:06.529
— Well, you back home now.
— Came back to see about the house

13:06.662 --> 13:09.199
now they're letting people back
in the Lower Nine to check.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.162
Our house is messed up bad.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.577
I got no idea what it's gonna take to fix it up,

13:13.710 --> 13:15.666
even if it can be.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.003
I'll go take a look at it with you.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.122
I appreciate it.

13:22.386 --> 13:26.129
— You gonna make a new suit?
— Every year.

13:26.264 --> 13:29.392
Might use last year's patches,
but I got some ideas.

13:29.518 --> 13:33.056
— What if they cancel Carnival?
- Shit.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.850
Where you think you at, Arizona?

13:37.609 --> 13:39.600
(J‘ Playing La Vie En Rose)

14:14.146 --> 14:16.512
— Hey, terrific.
- Thanks.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.309
How long have you been playing the fiddle?

14:18.442 --> 14:20.433
My whole life. Since I was, like, seven.

14:20.569 --> 14:23.936
— It shows, 'cause you got a lot of style.
- Thank you.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.690
- (Man) You play mostlyjazz?
— Pretty decent for a weekday.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.780
— I got a favor to ask.
— What's up?

14:30.912 --> 14:33.324
— Can I take this money off the top?
- (Annie) Yeah.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.698
I'll pay you back
off the top of tomorrow's take.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.119
I need to take care of something.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.210
l was wondering when the shit was gonna
make its way back from Houston.

14:40.338 --> 14:43.330
No, man, not that.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.209
Tomorrow's Annie's birthday.
I wanna buy her a present.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.801
Yeah, OK. Go ahead, lover boy.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.307
But don't tell her. It's a surprise.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.266
Present, no powder. You heard me?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.430
— Shit, man. The storm cleaned me up.
- Nice to meet you.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.144
Cleaned up the whole town.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.934
(Annie) Bye.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.147
— Hey, who was that?
— I don't know. Some guy.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.487
That was Tom McDermott.
He didn't introduce himself?

15:07.616 --> 15:10.028
— He said Tom. He didn't say McDermott.
- (Distant sirens)

15:10.160 --> 15:12.071
He's fuckin' great. I didn't recognize him.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.740
Sonny, why didn't you say something?

15:13.872 --> 15:16.238
Like what? Ask him for his autograph?

15:16.374 --> 15:19.958
He's a musician, I'm a musician.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.123
What did he want?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.667
He just talked.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.462
— About what?
— Music.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.050
That's all.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.807
(Mason) You drinking
those by yourself, man.

15:35.936 --> 15:39.144
Hanging on the street with white people
is like to get me shot.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.105
— Fuck the National Guard.
— You provoked them people.

15:42.234 --> 15:44.270
I'm lucky I'm not locked up right now,
my damn self.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.688
- Again.
— Say what?

15:46.822 --> 15:48.437
- (Barking)
— (Davis) Again!

15:48.573 --> 15:50.689
— You didn't see that?
- See what?

15:50.826 --> 15:52.316
The...

15:54.162 --> 15:55.618
Wait.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.747
(Mason) Fuck is wrong with you, boy?

16:06.341 --> 16:08.332
What the...

16:09.344 --> 16:11.335
Aw.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.557
(Dog barking)

16:30.907 --> 16:33.740
Structurally, it looks solid.

16:33.869 --> 16:37.327
Still on its foundations, at any rate.

16:37.455 --> 16:41.494
Mm, but that mold... I don't know.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.878
I hear they got plans for the Lower Nine.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.995
They gonna bulldozer all of it,

16:46.131 --> 16:48.087
give the land to developers.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.298
That's why you need to come back.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.167
They can't bulldoze nothing

16:52.304 --> 16:55.046
— if the homeowners don't allow it.
- Who gonna stop 'em?

16:55.182 --> 16:58.094
Your father would understand
what I'm talking about.

17:00.145 --> 17:03.854
- Jesse would know.
— How to stop a bulldozer?

17:05.942 --> 17:08.979
Motherfuckers think people won't fight.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.396
And most won't,

17:12.532 --> 17:14.739
but some will.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.655
(Grunts)

17:21.333 --> 17:24.541
The birds ain't even
coming back to this neighborhood.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.001
— You notice?
— Mm.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.885
— Jesse had a boat?
- Yeah.

17:36.014 --> 17:39.677
Why he ain't take it out for the storm?

17:43.772 --> 17:46.730
Come here. Help me with this.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.900
— Oh, Jesus!
— Daddy?

17:55.033 --> 17:56.989
— (Flies buzzing)
- Oh, my Lord.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.858
- (Albert) Oh.
— (Dogs barking)

18:01.039 --> 18:04.577
(Coughing, retching)

18:10.173 --> 18:11.879
(Music playing over speakers)

18:34.739 --> 18:36.400
Brouilly.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.444
That's a pretty good Beaujolais right there.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.237
- Is it?
— Yeah.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.702
Depending on what
you're gonna drink it with.

18:42.831 --> 18:46.289
Probably won't drink it with anything.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.909
I'll take it. I'll take this.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.912
OK. 19.99, please.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.039
(Coinsjingling)

18:55.677 --> 18:58.168
(Register beeping)

19:05.103 --> 19:07.094
— Do you need a bag?
- No.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.186
— Uh, that's ten.
— OK.

19:09.316 --> 19:12.524
And this is one, two, three...

19:12.652 --> 19:14.358
(Sirens blaring)

19:14.487 --> 19:16.318
(Dr. John) You know, listen. The fact is...

19:16.448 --> 19:19.736
I know some of y'all recognize
Wardell Quezergue's chart

19:19.868 --> 19:22.655
on an old Danny Barker version of this.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.278
Yeah, you gonna call the Indians
like you did on the album?

19:25.415 --> 19:28.031
Well, it might cause some
confusementalism

19:28.168 --> 19:30.204
amongst the Lincoln Center set, but...

19:30.337 --> 19:33.500
- (Laughter)
— And you know, some of the gangs

19:33.631 --> 19:36.338
ain't gonna like me
singing lndian Red anyway,

19:36.468 --> 19:38.880
because this is their most sacred song.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.344
But we gonna do this with the most love

19:41.473 --> 19:44.180
and respect that we can for the tradition.

19:44.309 --> 19:47.517
— You OK with that, Delmond?
— Yeah, it's fine by me.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.853
Well, your pa might cop a attitude, but...

19:50.982 --> 19:54.349
- He tends to do that.
— Well, let's do this sucker.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.566
(Man) All right.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.232
— One, two, one, two, three.
- (Cell phone ringing)

19:59.324 --> 20:01.610
Shit, shit.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.614
(Cell phone bleeps)

20:07.499 --> 20:09.535
(Man) Aww, shit.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.534
Call me when you get this.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.380
Wild Man Jesse's dead.

20:17.509 --> 20:19.670
I found the body.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.794
(Helicopters overhead)

20:30.814 --> 20:35.934
J‘ Golden Eagles, Wild Magnolias

20:36.069 --> 20:38.435
J‘ Of the little red, white and blue

20:38.571 --> 20:41.688
J‘ Pretty Monogram Hunters

20:42.534 --> 20:44.695
J‘ On nobody's ground

20:46.037 --> 20:49.529
J‘ I love to hear them call my lndian red

20:49.666 --> 20:52.157
J‘ Now here come the spy boy

20:52.293 --> 20:55.421
J‘ Spy boy
J‘ Flag boy

20:55.547 --> 20:57.879
J‘ Check out the crazy wild man

20:58.007 --> 21:00.874
J‘ The wildest in the lowlands,
and he loved our queen

21:01.886 --> 21:04.878
J‘ Queen of New Orleans

21:05.014 --> 21:08.256
J‘ I love to hear them call my lndian red J‘

21:10.812 --> 21:12.268
lndians!

21:12.397 --> 21:14.854
Here comes Big Chief Tootie Montana

21:14.983 --> 21:17.520
of the Yellow Pocahontas.

21:20.405 --> 21:25.069
Big Chief Rudy of the Ninth Ward Hunters.

21:26.911 --> 21:31.746
Big Chief Monk Boudreaux
of the Golden Eagles.

21:33.126 --> 21:37.085
Big Chief Jake of the White Eagles.

21:38.590 --> 21:43.710
Big Chief Bo Dollis of the Wild Magnolias.

21:44.762 --> 21:49.096
Big Chief Pete of the Black Eagles.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.927
Thank you for taking the time
to sit down with me, Sheriff.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.473
Well, New Orleans lawyer,

21:55.607 --> 21:57.848
all the way out here in the bayou country...

21:57.984 --> 22:00.475
Glad to make the time, Miss Bernette.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.069
Now, what's your concern
with inmate Brooks?

22:03.198 --> 22:05.860
The man you're holding
is not David Maurice Brooks.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.983
I need you to find out who he is,

22:08.119 --> 22:11.156
to make it clear to the
Orleans Parish Sheriff's Department

22:11.289 --> 22:13.530
they've lost a prisoner.

22:13.666 --> 22:17.875
— And how should I go about that?
- DNA test or fingerprints.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.744
On whose authority?

22:19.881 --> 22:22.543
Sheriff Babineaux, I'm certain you can relate

22:22.675 --> 22:26.293
to the anguish of a family
trying to locate a loved one

22:26.429 --> 22:28.090
after the chaos of the hurricane.

22:28.223 --> 22:31.966
Well, he came in here
under the name of David Brooks.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.012
Now, he might not be your David Brooks,

22:34.145 --> 22:37.637
but he sure as hell's my David Brooks...

22:37.774 --> 22:40.857
till Orleans Parish or the State of Louisiana
tells me different.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.852
Let me see if I understand this. Um...

22:45.949 --> 22:48.361
You're not gonna find out
who you have in your custody?

22:48.493 --> 22:51.485
Well, I know who I have in my custody.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.532
As to the prisoners that OPP sent here,

22:53.665 --> 22:55.781
they're in the custody of that parish.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.873
I'm just assisting them with the detention.

22:58.002 --> 23:01.290
And getting FEMA money
for every prisoner you keep locked down.

23:05.260 --> 23:08.798
I do believe there isn't anything else
for us to discuss, Miss Bernette.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.678
You drive safe going back.

23:16.187 --> 23:21.807
(Dr. John) J‘ He don't bow down
on nobody's ground

23:21.943 --> 23:23.854
J‘ I love to hear them call

J‘ Love to hear them call

23:26.906 --> 23:28.407

J‘ Wild, wild creation

23:40.795 --> 23:46.085
J‘ And we don't bow down
on nobody's ground

23:46.217 --> 23:49.584
J‘ I love to hear them call my lndian red

J‘ Jockomo feeno ah na ah na

24:10.575 --> 24:12.987
Y'all better get out the way.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.825
Hey!

24:14.954 --> 24:17.616
This here the Indians' day.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.990
J‘ Jockomo feeno ah na ah na J‘

24:20.126 --> 24:22.959
- This mine?
— (Man) Yeah, go for it.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.998
Man, I love New York every time through.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.122
Glad I came up for this charity thing.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.419
— You dig New York, you oughta see Paris.
- Yeah.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.292
It's a big world outside New Orleans.

24:31.429 --> 24:34.637
Paris. Ah, now that's the gig, yeah.

24:34.766 --> 24:36.381
(Delmond) To live here or over in Europe,

24:36.517 --> 24:38.473
places where they actually
respect musicians...

24:38.603 --> 24:41.811
I'm saying you blow better
than half the cats in New York, Shorty.

24:41.939 --> 24:45.102
If you was up here to live,
tssh, ain't no telling how far you'd take it.

24:45.234 --> 24:48.146
Look, brother, music is music.
Doesn't matter where you live.

24:48.279 --> 24:51.612
You don't miss home?

24:51.741 --> 24:55.325
New Orleans, they hype the music,
but they don't love the musicians.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.660
I mean, look at how guys
gotta leave to get their due.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.996
Pops, Prima, Wynton.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.332
I mean, the tradition is there,
but that city will grind you down if you let it.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.122
Look, man, we done been around the world.

25:05.254 --> 25:08.337
Y'all know we done played
every type of gig you can think of.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.422
— But there's no place like New Orleans.
- Yeah.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.257
- Nowhere, huh?
— (Man) That's right.

25:12.387 --> 25:14.924
Come on. (Chuckles)

25:16.516 --> 25:20.179
— (Announcer) Staci and Chantel on deck.
— (J‘ Music playing)

25:20.311 --> 25:23.678
— (Man) Shake that money—maker!
- Staci and Chantel on deck.

25:23.815 --> 25:26.727
(Second man) Come on,
up close to the pole.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.726
— Hey, Batiste. How's that 'bone?
- Uh-uh.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.978
Whoa, what'd I do?

25:34.367 --> 25:37.359
Girl, you trying to put me
out of my happy home.

25:37.495 --> 25:38.860
- Huh.
— Now I know.

25:38.996 --> 25:41.328
Go shake your ass and make some money.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.712
— Where you at, homes?
- All right.

25:46.838 --> 25:49.124
Lookit here.
Let's do some cuttin' up tonight.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.545
— I'm sick of this simple shit we playing.
— Nothing wrong with what we playing.

25:52.677 --> 25:55.214
No, I'm saying just take it up a notch.

25:55.346 --> 25:59.589
Man, they don't come to see us.
They come to see the bitches.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.217
— Got your bags packed yet, Batiste?
- What you mean?

26:02.353 --> 26:05.220
Don't tell me you haven't heard about
that big charity gig in New York.

26:05.356 --> 26:07.597
They have Kermit, Shorty, Charlie Miller.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.770
— Lincoln Center, bro.
- Lincoln Center?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.063
Man, I thought you was
all tight with Kermit and shit.

26:12.196 --> 26:13.936
Man, y'all come to play or to talk shit?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.906
All those heavy cats you talking
about jamming with all the time.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.241
And here you are in this joint with us.

26:19.370 --> 26:23.613
- Ain't that a bitch?
— (Guys snickering)

26:23.750 --> 26:27.163
— I need a fucking drink.
— (Guffawing)

26:33.050 --> 26:37.089
Why is that goddamn blue tarp
back on the roof again?

26:37.221 --> 26:41.089
— What happened to Riley?
— He didn't get it all done.

26:41.225 --> 26:44.342
So that triflin' motherfucker shows up,

26:44.479 --> 26:47.937
takes out the old shingles
and then disappears?

26:48.065 --> 26:51.432
— He said he'll be back on Monday.
— Monday?

26:51.569 --> 26:53.651
What the fuck's wrong with tomorrow?

26:53.780 --> 26:56.772
You know what? Uh—uh. Mm—mm.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.650
I ain't even gonna
get stressed out about this.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.198
(Dialing)

27:04.916 --> 27:07.373
(Ringing tone)

27:07.502 --> 27:09.458
(Man) You've reached
the Williams residence.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.293
— Leave a message.
—(Beeps)

27:11.422 --> 27:14.380
How you doing, Bernard?
It's your sister—in—law.

27:14.509 --> 27:18.843
I'm sorry to call you at home, but I left you
a couple of messages at your office.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.507
I hope you got those.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.596
Larry told me he talked to you

27:22.725 --> 27:26.638
and I'm hoping that we can talk
as soon as possible

27:26.771 --> 27:28.887
about my brother's situation.

27:29.023 --> 27:31.230
Please call as soon as
you get this message.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.645
Doesn't matter how late.

27:33.778 --> 27:37.612
853—2035.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.152
OK? Talk soon.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.275
Motherfucker!

27:43.246 --> 27:44.531
(Grunts)

27:58.678 --> 28:02.262
(Voices whispering)

28:02.390 --> 28:04.346
(Boy) Sh, sh.

28:04.475 --> 28:06.466
(Whispering continues)

28:07.979 --> 28:09.344
Whoa!

28:09.480 --> 28:11.391
What you doing, boy?
You stealing from me?

28:11.524 --> 28:12.855
No, sir, I wasn't stealing.

28:12.984 --> 28:15.020
What you trying to take?

28:15.152 --> 28:18.315
- Answer me, boy!
— I wasn't stealing, man, I swear.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.952
Put your pants on.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.202
Get your girl and go.

28:43.848 --> 28:46.840
— (J‘ Piano and fiddle playing)
- (Train horn)

29:08.080 --> 29:10.537
Let me get some of that.
Let me get some of that.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.498
(Mumbles)

29:13.628 --> 29:15.835
All right, hold on. Me and you, me and you.

29:17.089 --> 29:21.378
J‘ I need your love so badly

29:23.054 --> 29:27.593
J‘ I love you, oh, so madly

29:28.601 --> 29:32.139
J‘ But I don't stand

29:32.271 --> 29:35.638
J‘ A ghost of a chance

29:35.775 --> 29:38.107
J‘ With you
(Chuckles)

29:38.235 --> 29:41.853
_ J‘ Oh, with you
- (Police radio chatter)

29:43.824 --> 29:48.067
J‘ I thought at last I'd found you

29:50.206 --> 29:52.197
J‘ But other love

29:52.333 --> 29:54.745
J‘ Surrounds you

29:56.253 --> 29:59.666
J‘ But I don't stand

29:59.799 --> 30:04.042
J‘ A ghost of a chance

30:05.513 --> 30:07.469
J‘ With you J‘

30:10.685 --> 30:12.926
Whoo. (Chuckles)

30:15.439 --> 30:18.681
— (J‘ Vocalizing)
- Don't go.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.480
- Blow your horn, man.
— Man, I'm all blowed out.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.648
I like what y'all doing, though.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.863
(J‘ Singing fiddle melody)

30:25.992 --> 30:28.199
I like that.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.239
— Hey, asshole! What's your problem?
- Me?

30:31.372 --> 30:33.658
— You scratched up our fuckin' unit.
— Who did what now?

30:33.791 --> 30:35.622
— Put the horn down. On the ground.
— The horn?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.958
- I said on the ground.
— You got a hearing problem?

30:38.087 --> 30:40.703
— Hey, man, I don't have a case for my horn.
— Drop the goddamn horn.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.330
— Man, fuck this.
- Fuck who?

30:42.466 --> 30:45.424
Hey! Hey, man! Hey!

30:47.471 --> 30:49.848
- What are you doing?
— Get your hands behind your back.

30:49.974 --> 30:51.510
(Annie) He wasn't doing anything.

30:51.642 --> 30:54.019
— What are you doing to him?
— (Officer) Get up.

30:54.145 --> 30:57.808
- Get up.
— Wait, wait, wait. (Groaning)

30:59.150 --> 31:02.358
What'd I do? What'd I do, man?

31:02.486 --> 31:05.148
(Sighs) I'm going about this wrong.

31:05.281 --> 31:08.865
Orleans Parish has custody
of the real David Maurice Brooks,

31:08.993 --> 31:10.358
no matter whatjail he's in.

31:10.494 --> 31:13.031
So it's on Orleans Parish
to produce him.

31:13.164 --> 31:14.529
You gotta take them to court.

31:14.665 --> 31:17.577
— Yeah, they can't brush that off.
- Yeah.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.541
Hey, YouTube.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.881
So, I got called a bitch today

31:26.010 --> 31:28.046
on the streets of Baton Rouge.

31:28.179 --> 31:31.671
OK, I've only been here a few months,
but I can say with certainty

31:31.807 --> 31:34.093
that the most obnoxious thing
about Baton Rouge,

31:34.226 --> 31:36.512
and trust me, there are many candidates,

31:36.645 --> 31:38.476
is the LSU fans.

31:38.606 --> 31:40.221
They're honestly crazy up here.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.484
So, today, being a NOLA girl,

31:42.610 --> 31:45.317
I decided to rock my Tulane sweatshirt.

31:45.446 --> 31:46.731
l was walking to the store

31:46.864 --> 31:49.651
and this jerkoff sticks his head
out of a car window

31:49.784 --> 31:52.241
and says,
"Hey, bitch, get back to New Orleans!"

31:52.369 --> 31:57.329
And I'm like, "From your mouth
to God's ears, asshole."

31:58.292 --> 32:02.285
Another week till the semester's over
and I can finally go back home.

32:03.881 --> 32:05.371
Wh...what is this?

32:05.508 --> 32:08.591
— She put that on the internet somehow?
— It's called YouTube.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.755
Anybody can put anything up on there.

32:10.888 --> 32:12.424
Isn't that cool?

32:12.556 --> 32:14.763
What, that she's on the internet
saying, "Asshole"?

32:14.892 --> 32:18.760
— She's proud of her city.
— That's fabulous, Cray.

32:18.896 --> 32:20.386
Go Green Wave.

32:20.523 --> 32:24.061
Raise your children
in the way they should go.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.772
(J‘ Music blaring over speakers)

32:29.073 --> 32:31.234
(Whistles, sighs)

32:41.127 --> 32:43.243
Yes!

32:45.256 --> 32:47.212
Awesome.

32:47.341 --> 32:49.047
— Mr. McAlary.
- Hey.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.132
Mr. McAlary, please?

32:51.262 --> 32:54.220
I insist you show some regard.

32:54.348 --> 32:56.680
Why are you being so nasty about this?

32:56.809 --> 32:58.765
You have a problem with gay people?

32:58.894 --> 33:00.634
What? I don't care if you're gay.

33:00.771 --> 33:02.853
You can suck all the cock you want.

33:02.982 --> 33:06.645
Cosmically speaking, the more cocks
that get sucked in the world,

33:06.777 --> 33:08.893
the better for all humanity.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.229
We're your neighbors, Mr. McAlary.

33:12.366 --> 33:13.981
Exactly. You're my neighbors.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.029
You moved into the Treme,
you tart the place up,

33:16.162 --> 33:18.153
put in your birdcage, your flower gardens,

33:18.289 --> 33:22.407
and you don't have a fucking clue
as to where the fuck you are living.

33:22.543 --> 33:25.706
The place was a wreck.
We fixed it up with love,

33:25.838 --> 33:27.954
and a great deal of cash, I might add.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.331
— It's called historical preservation.
- No.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.550
It's called gentrification.
This is the Treme, dude,

33:33.679 --> 33:37.422
the most musically important
black neighborhood in America.

33:37.558 --> 33:39.423
Shannon Powell lives around the corner.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.175
Did you know that? Shannon fucking Powell.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.769
— I know all about the Treme.
- I seriously doubt that.

33:43.898 --> 33:47.061
Troy Andrews, James Andrews, uh...
all the damn Andrews,

33:47.193 --> 33:48.854
Nicholas Payton, Tuba Fats,

33:48.986 --> 33:50.772
way back to Sidney Bechet.

33:50.905 --> 33:52.486
Right next door to you
is the house of the man

33:52.615 --> 33:55.027
— who wrote Ooh Poo Pah Doo.
- Jessie Hill.

33:55.159 --> 33:57.024
That's right, Jessie Hill.
How'd you know that?

33:57.161 --> 33:59.743
I'm from Uptown, Mr. McAlary,

33:59.872 --> 34:01.783
and Allan grew up in Mid—City.

34:01.916 --> 34:04.202
We're as much New Orleans as you are.

34:04.335 --> 34:07.919
But you complain to the cops about
somebody's stereo being too loud...

34:08.047 --> 34:09.878
We have never once called the cops.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.214
..or somebody's practicing their horn at night

34:12.343 --> 34:14.629
or whatever second line
or street parade rolls by

34:14.762 --> 34:17.048
— without a fucking permit?
— That's not true.

34:17.181 --> 34:21.720
Well, somebody has,
and I believe it's you two chaps.

34:21.852 --> 34:25.390
You live in the Treme.
You gotta deal with that shit.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.391
(Helicopters overhead)

34:44.625 --> 34:46.206
Happy birthday.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.374
Sonny...

34:55.511 --> 34:57.376
— French.
— Oh.

35:03.978 --> 35:06.594
- Why save it?
— Tonight'll be better.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.345
(Whispers) Come here.

35:11.652 --> 35:13.267
You didn't know?

35:14.321 --> 35:16.186
l surprised you, didn't I?

35:16.323 --> 35:19.941
Yeah, you really did.

35:30.087 --> 35:32.169
— (Klaxon buzzes)
— (Chatter)

35:46.603 --> 35:49.310
Oh, my God, Antoine.
Have you seen a doctor?

35:49.440 --> 35:52.648
Thatbad,huh?
They knocked one of my teeth loose.

35:52.776 --> 35:56.610
— Might mess up my embouchure.
- Why did you get beat?

35:56.739 --> 35:59.481
I can't figure. l was walking.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.948
I think I bumped into a cop car with my horn.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.159
Next thing, I got two cops whalin' on me.

36:04.288 --> 36:06.529
— Were you resisting arrest?
— Arrest?

36:06.665 --> 36:08.826
They didn't arrest me
until after they kicked my ass.

36:08.959 --> 36:12.668
Now look here, Toni,
you gotta make sure they got my trombone.

36:12.796 --> 36:16.334
You gotta make sure they didn't leave it
out there on the street, all right?

36:16.467 --> 36:19.504
Let's try and get you out of here
and then we'll worry about your trombone.

36:19.636 --> 36:23.470
Without that horn I can't make a living.

36:25.142 --> 36:26.848
(J‘ Music playing)

36:29.188 --> 36:30.803
(Knocking at door)

36:35.611 --> 36:37.567
You cannot still be mad at me.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.108
— Come on.
— I'm not mad at you.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.617
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly,

36:42.743 --> 36:45.200
Davis McAlary
has to open the expensive wine

36:45.329 --> 36:47.866
and piss away all my money.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.704
There, to make up for it,

36:49.833 --> 36:51.664
— I'm taking you out for dinner.
— What's that?

36:51.794 --> 36:53.204
It's my paycheck from the hotel gig.

36:53.337 --> 36:55.202
Mon ami, you worked one day.

36:55.339 --> 36:58.502
And yet here I stand with a full week's pay.

36:58.634 --> 37:01.751
It's a Christmas miracle.
Come on, you pick, I pay.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.594
Davis, | work for a living
and on my off night I sleep.

37:04.723 --> 37:08.511
— Save your money.
— Janette, go out to dinner tonight.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.305
— On a Friday?
— Take a break.

37:10.437 --> 37:15.022
I'm giving myself a promotion, yeah?
And I'm giving you the night off.

37:15.150 --> 37:19.063
I'll put together a limited menu,
call Christopher to help.

37:19.196 --> 37:22.029
— How much?
— $347 and change.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.901
— Feelings, eight o'clock.
— Whoo!

37:27.037 --> 37:29.198
Feelings in the Marigny?

37:29.331 --> 37:31.287
You're gonna spend
every last dime, aren't you?

37:31.417 --> 37:33.533
Goddamn right.

37:34.711 --> 37:36.326
(Mouths)

37:41.385 --> 37:42.750
Here to see Judge Williams.

37:42.886 --> 37:46.504
— And you are?
— I am his sister—in—law.

37:46.640 --> 37:48.255
And I've been leaving messages,

37:48.392 --> 37:52.226
but those messages
don't seem to be getting through.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.766
Is the judge in his office?

37:54.898 --> 37:57.014
— Can you have a seat?
- I'm fine standing.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.768
My favorite saloon keeper.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.769
— Bernard.
— How you doing, LaDonna?

38:02.906 --> 38:06.615
— Got a minute to talk?
— Sure, sure. Come on back.

38:08.454 --> 38:11.241
lt's insane what's been happening.

38:11.373 --> 38:13.284
We just moved back in here a week ago.

38:13.417 --> 38:17.126
Entire electrical system had to be replaced,

38:17.254 --> 38:19.745
and the civil actions just keep piling up.

38:19.882 --> 38:22.874
I don't know how we're gonna find jurors
to hear all these cases.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.966
Larry talked to you about my brother?

38:25.095 --> 38:27.677
He did. I want to make some calls.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.671
Maybe I can shake something loose for you.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.344
Oh, thank you, Bernard.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.342
I understand you got
a lawyer working on this.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.686
— Yeah, Toni Bernette.
- Oh, she's good.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.648
Let me start there. I'll give Toni a call
and she'll bring me up to speed.

38:39.776 --> 38:42.392
— I can tell you anything you need to know.
— Well, I really...

38:42.529 --> 38:46.898
Daymo was in Orleans Parish Prison
when the storm hit. That is a fact.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.525
We got a picture of him
up on Broad Street Bridge, so...

38:49.661 --> 38:52.903
LaDonna, look, I'm gonna do
everything I can to help.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.951
Like I say, it's been crazy around here,

38:55.083 --> 38:57.699
but I promise I'll make some calls,

38:57.836 --> 39:00.168
see what kind of strings I can pull.

39:01.298 --> 39:03.414
|wi||.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.758
— Hey, Annie.
- Hey, Tom.

39:07.888 --> 39:10.095
(Tom) Hardly any tourists here.

39:10.224 --> 39:12.010
I guess you gotta wait till New Year's, huh?

39:12.142 --> 39:15.054
— Yeah, hopefully.
— But, man, look at the spot you got.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.769
— It's great.
— If the cops don't run us off.

39:17.898 --> 39:22.187
Oh, yeah, I hear they've been
hassling musicians pretty bad.

39:22.319 --> 39:23.684
You didn't meet Sonny, did you?

39:23.820 --> 39:26.232
— Hey, Sonny. How's it going?
- Hey.

39:27.991 --> 39:32.155
Hey, Annie, l have a private gig tonight

39:32.287 --> 39:34.903
and I could use a fiddle on a couple tunes.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.531
Uh, l was wondering,
you read music, huh?

39:37.668 --> 39:39.124
- Yeah.
— Check this out.

39:39.253 --> 39:42.586
It's a couple of Jelly Roll Morton tunes
I'd like you to play on.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.750
— You want me to play with you?
- Yeah.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.966
You know, it's gonna be over at the
old Bella Luna. Where that used to be.

39:48.095 --> 39:51.553
You know, it'll be a ball. Please consider it.

39:51.682 --> 39:53.092
Sonny can come too, right?

39:53.225 --> 39:55.511
— I mean, we're a team.
— Um, yeah.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.726
I can get him on the guest list,

39:57.854 --> 40:01.221
but, you know, I got the piano covered.

40:01.358 --> 40:05.852
— How much for her?
— (Sirens blaring)

40:05.988 --> 40:08.445
It's an open bar and it's free food,

40:08.574 --> 40:11.065
so, try and make it.

40:12.369 --> 40:14.655
(Officer) Time to roll. Come on.

40:16.373 --> 40:19.080
(J‘ Music playing over speakers)

40:23.422 --> 40:26.038
(Small dog barking)

40:29.344 --> 40:31.209
(Barking continues)

40:42.983 --> 40:45.099
(Barking)

41:05.547 --> 41:07.538
(Car pulling up)

41:09.926 --> 41:12.178
Had to make that drive again, huh?

41:12.304 --> 41:15.762
Had to for Jesse.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.882
Swear I can't picture him dead.

41:18.018 --> 41:20.009
And you don't want to either.

41:20.937 --> 41:23.394
We gotta send him off proper.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.650
I talked to Jimmy.
He's coming on down from Atlanta.

41:25.776 --> 41:27.983
You reach your son?

41:28.111 --> 41:31.524
Jesse was with you when Delmond
came up as spy boy, right?

41:31.657 --> 41:33.864
I left a message with him yesterday.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.654
He called me back today.

41:36.787 --> 41:38.493
— He gonna be here?
— (Woman) Boy, come on.

41:38.622 --> 41:40.863
— (Woman) Don't dawdle.
- Mm-mm.

41:42.292 --> 41:44.669
Do me a favor. You wanna go inside?

41:44.795 --> 41:47.002
All right, Chief.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.042
— You some kin to Poke, right?
— An old friend.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.836
Well, I noticed you workin' on his bar

41:51.968 --> 41:55.460
and l was wondering if you had some work
for my nephew.

41:55.597 --> 41:58.339
- Nephew?
— (Woman) Yeah, his folks are in Houston.

41:58.475 --> 42:00.261
But he didn't like it there
so he came on back.

42:00.394 --> 42:03.557
But school's not in yet and I said,
"Boy, you have to get some work.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.680
"Just can't be sitting around
getting into trouble."

42:05.816 --> 42:08.432
- Mmm.
— Isn't that right, Darius?

42:08.568 --> 42:09.899
You wanna work, son?

42:10.028 --> 42:12.986
He's willing to do anything
you need him to do.

42:13.115 --> 42:18.530
- Won't have to pay him too much neither.
— Well, if there's a need, I will let you know.

42:18.662 --> 42:20.869
Now, which house is yours?

42:20.997 --> 42:22.658
Round the corner on Washington.

42:22.791 --> 42:26.158
Yellow house, second from the corner.

42:26.294 --> 42:27.750
l'm Lula Pritchett.

42:27.879 --> 42:30.621
— Albert Lambreaux.
- Nice to meet you.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.668
The pleasure's all mine, ma'am.

42:44.730 --> 42:48.314
(Banging)

42:48.442 --> 42:51.058
(Simply Reds) Davis!

42:51.194 --> 42:52.900
— Davis, what the fuck?
— (Banging continues)

42:53.029 --> 42:55.486
Yeah! God.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.367
— Desperado.
— Public enemy number one.

43:05.500 --> 43:09.334
Dude, you gotta hear this song
I've been working on.

43:09.463 --> 43:12.205
It's not a prison ballad, is it?

43:12.340 --> 43:15.332
I've been inspired by the muses.

43:15.469 --> 43:19.053
Muses with big honkin' tits.

43:19.181 --> 43:21.172
(Snickering)

43:23.435 --> 43:25.551
Go ahead, hit me.

43:27.397 --> 43:29.262
J‘ On my balcony the other day

43:29.399 --> 43:31.731
J‘ Had myself a little smoke

43:33.236 --> 43:35.067
J‘ On my balcony the other day

43:35.197 --> 43:37.062
J‘ Had myself a little smoke

43:39.034 --> 43:41.275
J‘ When this white girl walked by

43:41.411 --> 43:43.072
J‘ Tell y'all it ain't no joke

43:45.040 --> 43:48.203
J‘ She had great big breasts,
a really small dog

43:48.335 --> 43:50.997
J‘ I'm sitting out there
staring like a bump on a log

43:51.129 --> 43:53.040
J‘ She walked into Chachi's

43:53.173 --> 43:55.129
J‘ Bought herself something a little sweet

43:56.927 --> 43:58.542
J‘ Took her dog and candy bar

43:58.678 --> 44:01.920
J‘ Walked into the house
just down the street

44:03.141 --> 44:04.551
J‘ I saw her the very next day

44:04.684 --> 44:07.426
J‘ With some friends
who were similarly endowed

44:08.939 --> 44:10.304
J‘ I saw her the very next day

44:10.440 --> 44:14.353
J‘ With some friends
who were similarly endowed

44:14.486 --> 44:16.147
J‘ And as a property owner

44:16.279 --> 44:18.816
J‘ I had to sing 'cause I was so proud

44:18.949 --> 44:20.985
(Laughs)

44:21.117 --> 44:24.484
J‘ I got strippers
movin' in my neighborhood

44:24.621 --> 44:26.327
(Splutters)

44:26.456 --> 44:30.916
J‘ I got strippers movin' in my neighborhood

44:32.128 --> 44:34.084
J‘ Well, you can call it gentrification

44:34.214 --> 44:36.296
J‘ I'm gonna call it good J‘

44:38.093 --> 44:39.958
(Laughing)

44:40.095 --> 44:42.837
— Right? Right?
— (Continues laughing)

44:42.973 --> 44:46.010
(J‘ Playing with piano)

44:57.863 --> 45:02.027
So, you know, the thing is,
over 100 degrees most of the days

45:02.158 --> 45:04.900
and we're in a boat
going from rooftop to rooftop.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.413
And we called out,
"If you can hear us, make a noise.

45:07.539 --> 45:08.995
"Make a noise."

45:09.124 --> 45:10.955
And if we heard something,

45:11.084 --> 45:13.075
we'd chop through the roof with an ax

45:13.211 --> 45:15.076
— and crawl in through the attic.
- Wow.

45:15.213 --> 45:19.707
l was the skinniest guy in the boat,
so it was me who had to crawl in, right?

45:19.843 --> 45:22.255
I found old people
been up in their attic for days,

45:22.387 --> 45:25.220
starving, dehydrated, crying,

45:26.725 --> 45:28.807
some of them dead already.

45:29.853 --> 45:32.310
— Blew my mind, man.
— That's stuff you can never forget.

45:32.439 --> 45:35.852
Dude, I seen snakes
crawling out of dead bodies,

45:35.984 --> 45:38.771
crabs coming off of them
with pieces of flesh.

46:03.553 --> 46:07.137
Uh, to liberation from wage slavery.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.927
- You got fired, Davis.
— All part of my grand plan.

46:10.060 --> 46:11.925
I'm a musician.

46:12.062 --> 46:14.553
In fact, I wrote a song today.

46:14.689 --> 46:15.895
— Did you?
— Mm—hm.

46:16.024 --> 46:18.731
To doing what we love.

46:24.741 --> 46:26.652
— Decent.
— It's better than decent.

46:26.785 --> 46:28.525
A little young.

46:28.662 --> 46:29.902
— Chef.
— Chef.

46:30.038 --> 46:31.778
— What a great meal.
— Thank you.

46:31.915 --> 46:33.951
— How many covers you do tonight?
— About 47.

46:34.084 --> 46:35.745
Getting back on our feet.

46:35.877 --> 46:37.663
It's a good thing
Jim and Dale own this place,

46:37.796 --> 46:41.004
because if they had to pay rent,
we couldn't stay in business.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.963
How about you? How you holding up?

46:43.093 --> 46:45.175
I think I'm gonna make it.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.634
(Woman) Excuse me. Chef McHugh?

46:46.763 --> 46:48.128
— Excuse me.
— Yeah.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.926
Great to see you, Janette, Davis.

47:17.043 --> 47:18.999
Did you change your sheets, at least?

48:11.222 --> 48:13.383
- Hey.
— Yeah.

48:15.977 --> 48:17.558
Hey, you know what?

48:17.687 --> 48:20.224
You should have a piano at your bar.

48:20.356 --> 48:21.391
- Davis.
— Yeah?

48:21.524 --> 48:23.515
— Try not to talk.
- OK.

48:24.527 --> 48:26.939
— Come on.
— Wait.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.398
(Streetcar bell dinging)

48:45.548 --> 48:47.880
(Train horn blaring)

48:50.428 --> 48:53.795
Davis McAlary, here for the piano lesson.

48:53.932 --> 48:55.888
Oh, yeah! Come on in.

48:56.017 --> 48:58.008
Sofia.

49:09.906 --> 49:12.739
— You're a professor, right?
— Yep.

49:12.867 --> 49:15.483
I love to teach. I'm sure you can relate.

49:15.620 --> 49:19.112
I love it so much I often shave before I do it.

49:19.249 --> 49:21.080
(Laughing)

49:21.209 --> 49:23.245
Yeah.

49:27.006 --> 49:28.746
Tulane's back in business next month.

49:28.883 --> 49:31.625
That's a good thing.
English department, right?

49:31.761 --> 49:33.467
l majored in English. Goddard College.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.552
Sofia!

49:39.102 --> 49:41.343
Your piano teacher's here.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.015
You can call me Davis.

49:43.148 --> 49:44.513
$335

49:44.649 --> 49:48.312
OK, so, um,
I understand you've been learning

49:48.444 --> 49:50.309
mostly classical stuff, right?

49:50.446 --> 49:53.358
— Yeah.
— OK, here's the deal, Sofia.

49:53.491 --> 49:57.655
Forget everything
you've been told about Jesus,

49:57.787 --> 49:59.368
Buddha, Allah,

49:59.497 --> 50:02.364
because there is only one God,
and his name

50:02.500 --> 50:05.207
is Professor Longhair, OK?

50:05.336 --> 50:09.500
And he wrote this song called Tipitina.

50:09.632 --> 50:12.749
All right. OK, eight—bar blues.

50:12.886 --> 50:15.548
The first thing we're gonna cop
is the bass line with the left hand.

50:15.680 --> 50:18.922
OK, so it's F, A and the C.

50:19.058 --> 50:21.549
— OK? The one, three, five of the F chord.
— (J‘ Playing notes)

50:21.686 --> 50:23.517
— You follow me so far?
- Yeah, keep going.

50:23.646 --> 50:25.637
OK. It's a mambo rhythm,

50:25.773 --> 50:27.934
so it's a dotted quarter,
dotted quarter, quarter.

50:28.067 --> 50:30.023
So the rhythm is...

50:30.153 --> 50:32.485
— (J‘ Playing notes)
— ..one and a—two and a—three.

50:32.614 --> 50:35.981
And one and a—two and a—three
and...play that.

50:36.117 --> 50:38.654
Three. And one and a—two...

50:38.786 --> 50:41.778
— (J‘ Continues playing)
- And...

50:41.915 --> 50:44.281
We're at a point now
where the parish will never admit

50:44.417 --> 50:48.330
that there are any prisoners missing,
so we have to go to court.

50:48.463 --> 50:49.669
(Sighs)

50:54.886 --> 50:57.127
Toni, l have to tell you...

50:57.263 --> 51:01.222
I got to where I didn't know
if you was gonna be on this the right way,

51:01.351 --> 51:04.388
so I tried to reach out
to my husband's brother.

51:04.520 --> 51:08.104
— He's a civil courtjudge. Bernard Williams.
- Mm-hm.

51:08.233 --> 51:09.769
He said he was gonna call you,

51:09.901 --> 51:12.062
— but I'm guessing...
- Mm-mm.

51:12.195 --> 51:15.653
OK, I figured he wasn't
gonna do shit anyway.

51:15.782 --> 51:17.864
My husband's family.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.983
They into that Seventh Ward Creole shit

51:20.119 --> 51:22.531
like they a different fucking race.

51:22.664 --> 51:26.577
Never miss a chance
to remind me I ain't one of them.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.700
Well, I could give Judge Williams a call,

51:28.836 --> 51:30.918
see if he has some kind of pull.

51:31.047 --> 51:35.416
They the people pulling strings,
getting shit done.

51:35.551 --> 51:38.918
People like us. My mother,

51:39.055 --> 51:41.421
me and my brother,

51:41.557 --> 51:44.424
we just folks from around the way.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.937
We get shit done to us.

51:50.692 --> 51:52.853
I shouldn't be telling you this.

51:55.363 --> 51:57.649
I'm sorry for my doubts.

52:04.497 --> 52:06.613
(J‘ Piano playing)

52:06.749 --> 52:08.285
— Hey.
— Hey.

52:08.418 --> 52:11.251
— How'd it go?
—Gmm!

52:11.379 --> 52:13.995
— A lot of potential.
- Potential, huh?

52:14.132 --> 52:15.963
Yeah. I mean,
you never know what to expect.

52:16.092 --> 52:17.798
I mean, you know, you never know.

52:17.927 --> 52:20.168
She surprised you.

52:20.305 --> 52:23.297
She's got it in her, definitely.
I'm gonna enjoy working with her.

52:23.433 --> 52:25.924
— And you know talent when you see it.
— Yeah.

52:26.060 --> 52:29.928
I mean, it's hard not to recognize, but...

52:34.694 --> 52:36.059
I'll see you next week.

52:36.195 --> 52:37.901
— Hang on, Davis.
- Yeah?

52:38.031 --> 52:40.568
Let me ask.
You work with a lot of beginners, right?

52:40.700 --> 52:44.818
Oh, I love that because,
you know, musicians...

52:44.954 --> 52:46.819
Pros tend to be messed up in a lot of ways

52:46.956 --> 52:49.072
and kids bring such a freshness to it,
you know?

52:49.208 --> 52:52.336
Not...not saying that there's
anything wrong with being a musician.

52:52.462 --> 52:56.000
I mean, Sofia could definitely
do that if she wanted to.

52:56.132 --> 52:58.544
Don't let your mind get ahead of you, Davis.

53:00.136 --> 53:02.548
— OK.
— Piano lessons.

53:02.680 --> 53:03.760
Yeah.

53:03.890 --> 53:06.848
Don't think about
what she will or won't do in the future.

53:06.976 --> 53:08.386
That has nothing to do with you.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.896
Oh, I... lwasjust saying.

53:11.022 --> 53:13.354
I'll see you next week, Davis.

53:13.483 --> 53:15.474
OK.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.650
Take it easy.

53:24.535 --> 53:26.696
Fucking piano lessons.

— How are you doing?

53:57.026 --> 53:59.017
Hey, man.

54:02.115 --> 54:04.071
- Big Chief Darryl.
— What's happening, Chief?

54:04.200 --> 54:06.031
— What's going on?
— All right.

54:07.495 --> 54:09.907
We're glad to have the Golden Eagles
with us on this.

54:10.039 --> 54:13.577
Yeah. So few of us back.

54:13.709 --> 54:17.247
My family's making funeral arrangements,

54:17.380 --> 54:20.872
