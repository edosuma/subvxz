Last season on
"Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood"...

00:04.738 --> 00:06.406
{\an8}(Marla)
Get your ass
into the courtroom,

00:06.473 --> 00:09.876
{\an8}get full custody,
and let her pay you,
then go hire a nanny.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.278
{\an7}If you gonna be a parent
to Moniece, Marla,

00:12.345 --> 00:15.348
{\an8}I feel like you should support
her through her demise, period.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.817
{\an8}You have never cared!

00:17.884 --> 00:19.719
{\an8}Not until yesterday
did I get a glimpse

00:19.786 --> 00:21.454
{\an7}that you did not have
a support system.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.989
{\an7}You're attacking me
and I'm the one

00:23.056 --> 00:24.958
{\an7}that's been helping
all this time.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.027
{\an8}This is the summer of Momo,

00:28.094 --> 00:30.263
{\an7}where you'll just be able
to check off your bucket list.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.232
{\an8}Ring shopping.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.232
{\an7}Okay.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.868
{\an8}I still love you,
I will always love you.

00:34.934 --> 00:38.371
{\an7}I don't know if I really see us
in that space again.

00:38.438 --> 00:39.973
{\an8}Fizz, he's like, you know,

00:40.039 --> 00:42.175
{\an7}Moniece admitted to me
she was still in love with me.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.277
{\an7}It wasn't about
moving forward with me.

00:44.344 --> 00:45.779
{\an7}It wasn't about
none of that!

00:45.845 --> 00:47.847
{\an7}Tell that (bleep) to give you
the mother(bleep) ring!

00:47.914 --> 00:49.582
{\an7}You stuck your nose
in my business.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.851
{\an7}I don't give a (bleep)
about your (bleep) boyfriend.

00:51.918 --> 00:54.053
{\an7}Bitch!

00:54.120 --> 00:55.622
{\an8}What are you doing?

00:55.688 --> 00:57.190
{\an8}Getting ready to hit the stu'.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.626
{\an8}Which means, probably
gonna be girls around.

00:59.692 --> 01:02.195
{\an7}This is why the bitch doesn't
know you (bleep) married!

01:02.262 --> 01:04.464
{\an7}Why don't you wear your ring
when you go into the (bleep)?!

01:04.531 --> 01:06.032
{\an7}Since you care
about this ring so much.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.234
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.234
{\an8}You can have it.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.569
{\an8}I love you to death.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.271
{\an8}What do I gotta do
to bring you back home?

01:11.337 --> 01:13.673
{\an7}You can start off by
getting rid of your apartment.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.941
{\an8}(bleep) that apartment.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.911
{\an8}Now, let's turn
this mother(bleep) out!

01:17.977 --> 01:19.112
{\an8}(all cheering)

01:22.115 --> 01:23.817
{\an8}Bum-ass bitch!

01:23.883 --> 01:27.220
{\an8}In order for you
to realize what you have,

01:27.287 --> 01:28.588
{\an8}you have to be without me.

01:28.655 --> 01:29.956
{\an8}So you don't wanna
be with me no more?

01:30.023 --> 01:31.291
{\an8}I don't wanna
be with you no more.

01:31.357 --> 01:32.725
{\an8}I just need another chance.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.828
{\an8}The only person that means
something to me is you.

01:34.894 --> 01:37.063
{\an8}I wanna give her
something special,

01:37.130 --> 01:40.066
{\an7}so when she looks in my eyes,
she sees her future,

01:40.133 --> 01:42.902
{\an8}our future, together.

{\an5}(Ray J)
You know, I never
thought I'd see the day,

02:37.023 --> 02:37.991
but here it is.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.326
{\an8}Your boy Ray J is a changed man.

02:40.393 --> 02:43.129
{\an8}I got the most incredible woman
by my side now,

02:43.196 --> 02:44.931
{\an8}Miss Princess Love.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.534
Through the good and the bad,
she's been riding for me,

02:47.600 --> 02:49.636
and now it's time
to turn the page

02:49.702 --> 02:51.604
and spend the rest of my life
with her.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.275
(record scratch effect)

02:55.341 --> 02:57.443
All right, we just need
to make an adjustment.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.978
{\an3}I love you.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.347
(Princess)
After last year, I never thought

03:01.414 --> 03:02.448
Ray and I would be here.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.285
{\an8}But I'm officially his fiancée.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.954
And today, we're doing a photo
shoot for a magazine spread,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.256
so the whole world knows it.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.491
{\an5}You look good, baby.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.491
{\an3}Thank you.

03:11.558 --> 03:12.792
{\an1}I know, though,
the wedding dress you have on

03:12.859 --> 03:14.193
gonna be way better
than that, though.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.929
{\an1}And it's gonna be
way bigger.

03:15.995 --> 03:19.098
{\an1}Way better, way more
emotional, and it'll be real.

03:19.165 --> 03:20.700
{\an6}Okay.

03:19.165 --> 03:20.700
{\an1}I'm gonna be
nervous as hell.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.468
{\an1}All right, Ray, if you can
take five for a couple minutes,

03:22.535 --> 03:24.337
we're gonna get
some singles of Princess.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.505
{\an4}Okay.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.505
Thank you.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.940
{\an4}Love you.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.940
{\an3}Love you.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.475
{\an1}I'm gonna go holler
at my mama.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.611
{\an5}Okay.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.611
{\an1}Thank you.

03:31.678 --> 03:32.779
How am I supposed
to stand?

03:32.845 --> 03:34.480
However you like.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.816
{\an1}Chin up just a little,
Princess. Good.

03:36.883 --> 03:37.817
{\an1}Mm, can we talk
for a second?

03:37.884 --> 03:39.352
{\an5}Yeah. Come on.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.352
{\an1}Okay.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.955
{\an5}(Princess)
Ray's mother Sonja
is also his manager,

03:42.021 --> 03:43.923
which has always been
a little weird for me.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.193
I keep getting this feeling that
I'm in competition

03:47.260 --> 03:49.862
with my mother-in-law
over her son.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.197
(Ray J)
You like the photo shoot?

03:51.264 --> 03:53.232
I loved it and I love you,

03:53.299 --> 03:56.302
{\an7}but, you know, I'm also
that business side.

03:56.369 --> 04:00.974
{\an1}I'm bringing you an agreement
for you to look over.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.909
This is a prenup.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.111
It's necessary,

04:05.178 --> 04:07.447
{\an1}and it's something that you
and Princess should do.

04:07.513 --> 04:11.718
I feel like me and Princess just
got together in the right way

04:11.784 --> 04:15.188
and I don't feel like right now
is the time to be like,

04:15.254 --> 04:18.057
"Yo, baby, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you,

04:18.124 --> 04:20.159
but sign this prenup."

04:20.226 --> 04:22.295
{\an5}That's a lot of pressure
to go and just
say that word

04:22.362 --> 04:24.631
to the person
you getting married to.

04:24.697 --> 04:25.765
"Prenup" is kinda--

04:25.832 --> 04:26.766
{\an1}Well,
I'll tell you what.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.267
If things work out,

04:28.334 --> 04:29.802
{\an1}it doesn't really matter,
does it?

04:29.869 --> 04:32.572
I know, but I don't
want to make her mad.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.073
{\an4}Listen...

04:32.639 --> 04:34.073
And make her feel like--

04:34.140 --> 04:37.143
{\an1}You are making me mad
right about now.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.678
{\an1}And I'm telling you
right now,

04:38.745 --> 04:40.613
{\an1}that's one thing
that you and I

04:40.680 --> 04:43.549
{\an1}will fight over
until it is signed.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.318
{\an1}Seriously, you need
to have this done

04:45.385 --> 04:46.753
before the engagement party.

04:46.819 --> 04:50.289
My son's behavior changed
when he got with her.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.492
You have to think about all
of the fights that they've had,

04:52.558 --> 04:54.761
going to jail, you gotta think
about all of that.

04:54.827 --> 04:58.865
That just doesn't add up
to not have, you know,

04:58.931 --> 05:02.702
a prearrangement or a prenup--
that just doesn't add up.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.470
Read my lips.

05:04.537 --> 05:08.074
There will be a prenup.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.742
{\an1}That's all
I gotta say.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.381
♪♪

05:18.751 --> 05:21.621
{\an8}Last year, I made the fatal
mistake of giving my heart

05:21.688 --> 05:23.723
{\an8}to none other than Richie D.

05:23.790 --> 05:27.060
{\an8}And he ripped it right out of my
chest, stomped on it, tossed it.

05:27.126 --> 05:29.128
{\an8}So I figure it's time
to toss him.

05:29.195 --> 05:32.832
And recently, there's been
a new man in my humble abode

05:32.899 --> 05:35.268
and it's gonna
take some getting used to.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.203
{\an1}It's been a while since
I've had a man in the house

05:37.270 --> 05:39.672
other than Cammy.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.441
A man like daddy.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.542
{\an3}Psych.

05:42.608 --> 05:43.676
{\an1}(laughing)

05:43.743 --> 05:45.244
{\an8}I know what y'all
are thinking.

05:45.311 --> 05:48.581
{\an8}Me living with Moniece, of all
people, but trust me when I say,

05:48.648 --> 05:51.084
this is definitely
just a temporary situation.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.953
I was forced to evacuate
my house

05:54.020 --> 05:57.190
from this terrible
Porter Ranch gas leak.

05:57.256 --> 06:01.294
Let's just lay
some boundaries.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.395
{\an3}Number one:

06:02.462 --> 06:05.465
no bitches running
in and out.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.567
{\an1}I don't want to get up in
the wee hours of the morning

06:07.633 --> 06:09.769
and see a ho traipsing
down my hallway.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.037
{\an1}Yo...
(chuckling)

06:11.104 --> 06:12.038
I don't want you
to pay--

06:12.105 --> 06:13.206
{\an1}What do you
take me for, yo?

06:13.272 --> 06:14.807
I'm just say--
I'm just saying.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.609
I don't want to hear
no moanings,

06:16.676 --> 06:19.879
no groanings,
no, "Yes! "

06:19.946 --> 06:23.950
No shouting, if it's not
a holy, "Hallelujah!"

06:24.016 --> 06:25.218
{\an5}Those are acceptable.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.218
What about on your end?

06:25.284 --> 06:27.153
{\an5}What about on your end?

06:25.284 --> 06:27.153
I would never...

06:27.220 --> 06:29.822
while my son is present,
ever.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.891
{\an1}So, you know, I've come
over here a few times

06:31.958 --> 06:34.660
{\an1}to pick him up in the morning,
take him to school.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.529
{\an1}I would appreciate
if you not walking around

06:36.596 --> 06:38.598
{\an1}with your monkey
all over the place.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.066
Are you referring
to my vagina?

06:40.133 --> 06:42.502
{\an5}Keep the monkey up.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.502
Okay, back up.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.636
6:00 in the morning.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.071
{\an1}(raspy)
"Hello?"

06:45.138 --> 06:46.439
{\an5}Lies you tell.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.439
Monkey out.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.307
My monkey was not out,
don't play with me.

06:48.374 --> 06:49.609
{\an1}Looking like
"Jeepers Creepers."

06:49.675 --> 06:50.810
Don't play with me,
I may be--

06:50.877 --> 06:52.812
I can be
a jeepers creeper.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.180
{\an5}Secondly...

06:52.879 --> 06:54.180
I'm not done.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.482
You got yours out,
let me finish mine.

06:56.549 --> 06:59.986
{\an1}If you're gonna have
friends over, I don't care,

07:00.052 --> 07:03.022
as long as I don't walk up
in this bitch and see

07:03.089 --> 07:06.259
a (bleep)
Max Lux or Brandy.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.361
{\an1}Max is the homey.
You trippin'.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.829
{\an5}His wife is not the homey.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.829
You trippin'.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.831
{\an1}First off,
you need to let that go.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.566
Not only is Max the homey,

07:13.633 --> 07:15.535
but he's also a producer
I worked with,

07:15.601 --> 07:17.904
which in turn
helps me pay the bills

07:17.970 --> 07:19.539
and take care of our son.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.909
Moniece really needs to leave
this (bleep) in the past.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.344
But once she feels dissed,
she can't move on

07:25.411 --> 07:27.280
until she's fully retaliated,

07:27.346 --> 07:28.447
and all this Twitter thugging

07:28.514 --> 07:30.983
and going back and forth
is ridiculous.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.786
{\an5}I don't want to see
either one of them
in this house.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.822
(Moniece)
Brandy, a.k.a. Little Bitch,

07:35.888 --> 07:37.890
attacked my motherhood
in New York,

07:37.957 --> 07:39.992
and so now,
my blood is boiling,

07:40.059 --> 07:43.396
and, really, all I want to do
is smash her (bleep) face.

07:43.462 --> 07:44.764
You agree on my boundaries

07:44.831 --> 07:46.866
and you agree that I'm

Now he's living in his dream.

14:19.758 --> 14:21.727

the passion for music,

14:21.794 --> 14:23.229
of becoming an artist,

14:23.295 --> 14:26.232
but when I became a mother,
that kinda changed for me.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.601

for me to finally

14:28.667 --> 14:30.803

Straight up, let me
hear something."

"I ain't got nothing."

to take the shot, man.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.993
{\an1}I can start,
and we can create that way.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.595
But you know how I am
about you and Blaze.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.964
I know Willie questions me
working with Blaze again,

14:59.031 --> 15:00.633
'cause back in the day,
Blaze put me in

15:00.699 --> 15:02.534
an uncomfortable situation,

15:02.601 --> 15:05.704
and it's kinda been a sore topic
of my marriage ever since.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.606
But Blaze is a dope producer,

15:07.673 --> 15:09.408
and he knows what I want
in my music,

15:09.475 --> 15:13.212
and that combo is kinda hard
to come by in this town.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.081
You know,
past situations,

15:16.148 --> 15:17.149
{\an1}Blaze taking all them hits
at you, I just don't think--

15:17.216 --> 15:18.217
{\an1}Look,
I'm a grown-ass woman.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.385
{\an1}I know how
to conduct myself,

15:19.451 --> 15:21.887
{\an1}and I am a grown
married woman, at that.

15:21.954 --> 15:25.557
{\an1}I just want to have
full control of my career,

15:25.624 --> 15:27.026
and if I need help,

15:27.092 --> 15:29.128
{\an1}he's the first mother(bleep)
I'm gonna ask.

{\an1}Hi.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.450
I like her hair.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.018
{\an8}Today is the Mommies &amp; Mimosas
brunch,

15:53.085 --> 15:55.087
{\an8}and I'm hosting
with my friend Nia,

15:55.154 --> 15:56.722
{\an8}and as excited as I am,

15:56.789 --> 16:01.660
I'm not so excited to see
Smurfette, a.k.a. Brandi.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.929
That bitch definitely
has it coming if she decides

16:03.996 --> 16:05.464
to get out of pocket today.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.132
{\an5}(Nia)
Thank you guys
for coming.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.168
{\an5}There's no kids,
so it doesn't get
any better than that.

16:09.234 --> 16:12.104
{\an1}We just wanted to say hi.
We're gonna go make our rounds.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.806
{\an5}All right, guys.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.806
{\an3}Thank you.

16:13.872 --> 16:15.774
Nice meeting you.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.209
(Moniece)
Okay, they're here.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.277
(Nia)
Please stand here.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.278
{\an4}Yes.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.278
And I'll be back.

16:19.345 --> 16:20.279
{\an1}Yes.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.747
This looks nice.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.049
{\an4}Hello.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.049
Thank you for coming.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.117
{\an5}How are you?

16:24.116 --> 16:25.117
{\an3}Mwah!

16:25.184 --> 16:26.352
{\an4}Hey, boo.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.352
Hey, pretty.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.087
{\an5}How are you?

16:26.418 --> 16:28.087
{\an3}I'm good.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.655
{\an5}How are you guys?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.655
This is nice.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.357
{\an1}Okay, well, I got somewhere
for you guys to sit over here.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.958
{\an4}Okay.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.958
So come with me.

{\an8}(Brandi)
When Nia told me Moniece
was gonna be at this event,

16:36.228 --> 16:37.296
{\an8}I first thought, "Ugh."

16:37.363 --> 16:38.997
{\an8}But then I thought,
"Oh, yeah.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.867
{\an8}I gotta deal with this bitch.
Thank you."

16:41.934 --> 16:44.770
{\an5}(Moniece)
Now go rocking her
sidekick, so exciting.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.272
{\an1}Don't walk into
a situation negative.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.340
{\an5}Hello.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.340
What's up, girls?

16:48.407 --> 16:50.042
{\an5}Hello, ladies.

16:48.407 --> 16:50.042
Hello.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.111
{\an1}You know Moniece is hosting
the event with me.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.079
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.079
{\an1}But we are
all mothers.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.814
{\an5}Yeah, we are.

16:54.146 --> 16:55.814
{\an1}So...

16:55.881 --> 16:57.750
I didn't know I was
in the mommy club.

16:57.816 --> 16:58.851
I thought I was,
like, kicked out.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.018
{\an1}Don't do that.
You're not--

17:00.085 --> 17:01.653
Why would you
be kicked out?

17:01.720 --> 17:04.356
{\an1}You know, apparently, I'm not
a mom, or a good one, at least.

17:04.423 --> 17:05.924
You are a mother.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.659
{\an1}I don't know what kind of
mother either one of you are,

17:07.726 --> 17:09.528
so I don't speak on that.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.262
Well, when we had
our altercation,

17:11.329 --> 17:13.598
I was speaking
from my experience.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.501
{\an1}You felt the need
to chime in.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.435
{\an5}You don't know about--

17:15.567 --> 17:17.435
It made me passionate about--

17:17.502 --> 17:19.037
{\an1}I don't care
about your passion.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.140
I'm passionate
about my child,

17:21.205 --> 17:23.075
{\an1}the same way you're
passionate about yours.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.042
This is supposed to be an event
where mothers get together

17:25.109 --> 17:26.612
and we support each other.

17:26.678 --> 17:29.548
I think we're all hoping that
these two could bury their beef,

17:29.615 --> 17:31.617
but I guess some things
never change.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.552
{\an1}You don't know me.
You don't know my story--

17:33.619 --> 17:35.421
{\an5}I don't need to, though.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.421
You don't know my struggle.

17:35.487 --> 17:38.223
{\an5}Your struggle--

17:35.487 --> 17:38.223
But you judge my solution!

17:38.290 --> 17:39.258
{\an5}You judge my solution!

17:38.290 --> 17:39.258
I judge what you put out!

17:39.324 --> 17:40.659
Wait, Brandi.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.694
You're the bitch.
You're the bitch.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.596
{\an1}You judge my solution,
and that right there

17:44.663 --> 17:46.165
is where you (bleep) up.

17:46.231 --> 17:48.367
{\an1}Little girl, don't forget,
bitch, I can see you right now.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.402
{\an1}You're not gonna be a victim
when you send threats

17:50.469 --> 17:51.937
to my (bleep) Instagram.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.472
{\an1}It wasn't a--
It's not a threat.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.607
{\an1}Don't threaten my (bleep)--
(bleep) you, honey.

17:55.674 --> 17:57.709
Sweetheart, move real quick,
'cause I gotta talk to this--

17:57.776 --> 17:59.645
Bitch, you are not the victim,

17:59.711 --> 18:01.146
and you gonna stop
playing the victim,

18:01.213 --> 18:03.449
'cause nobody would
agree with that diarrhea

18:03.515 --> 18:06.218
that ran out your mother(bleep)
mouth on your Instagram.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.888
What I really want
is a well-deserved,

18:09.955 --> 18:11.924
sincere apology.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.026
And I'm not leaving
until I get one.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.861
{\an5}(bleep) you!

18:14.092 --> 18:15.861
(bleep) you, bitch!

18:15.928 --> 18:17.029
Everybody needs
to shut the (bleep) up!

18:17.095 --> 18:18.397
Why can't we talk?

18:18.464 --> 18:19.531
{\an5}(Brandi)
She's started yelling,
I was quiet!

18:19.598 --> 18:20.899
You gotta sit down.

18:20.966 --> 18:22.568
Brandi, please.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.703
{\an5}(Nia)
This is my
Mommies &amp; Mimosas event,

18:24.770 --> 18:26.939
and these two
are acting like children.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.607
They better break it up
and play nice

18:28.674 --> 18:30.108
before I kick
the both of them out of here.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.944
{\an1}Calm down.
Everybody be calm.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.078
I'm talking calmly.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.346
{\an1}Okay.

18:34.413 --> 18:38.116
I feel that you
attacked me wrongfully--

18:38.183 --> 18:39.918
But the problem
I can't move forward is,

18:39.985 --> 18:41.887
is that you said,
about my son--

18:41.954 --> 18:42.888
you haven't
addressed that.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.356
{\an1}So--
I'm getting there.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.557
I'm getting there.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.159
That's (bleep)
I will never be okay.

18:47.226 --> 18:50.462
{\an1}I'm getting there.
I would never threaten a child.

18:50.529 --> 18:51.864
My comment was about you,

18:51.930 --> 18:53.665
{\an1}so if that's how you felt
in the moment

18:53.732 --> 18:55.334
when I made the comment,

18:55.400 --> 18:57.269
{\an1}then you have
my sincerest apologies.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.805
{\an1}I don't want an apology
from you because I don't feel

18:59.872 --> 19:01.807
{\an1}like you feel
that you are sorry

19:01.874 --> 19:03.175
{\an1}for the way
you made me feel.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.243
I feel that I am sorry--

19:04.309 --> 19:05.477
And so that's that.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.312
'Cause that wasn't
what I was there to do.

19:07.379 --> 19:09.047
{\an1}This is draining,
period.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.582
{\an1}So draining.
It's done.

19:14.386 --> 19:15.687
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

19:15.754 --> 19:19.791
{\an7}I just wanted to know
what you thought about a prenup.

19:19.858 --> 19:22.160
{\an7}Like, we gotta figure
this (bleep) out.

19:22.227 --> 19:23.996
{\an7}It's almost like we're
getting ready to get divorced

19:24.062 --> 19:25.430
{\an8}before we even get married.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.167
{\an7}Are you looking
to settle down right now?

19:29.234 --> 19:30.802
{\an8}We taking baby steps,
remember?

19:30.869 --> 19:33.038
{\an8}As long as you don't live
with no girl, that's okay.

19:39.878 --> 19:42.548
{\an8}♪♪

19:47.753 --> 19:51.189
{\an5}(Ray J)
Ever since Moms told me about
the prenup, I been bugging out.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.724
I mean, Moms is right.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.460
{\an8}Me and Princess should have
an understanding, but damn!

19:55.527 --> 19:57.763
{\an8}We ain't even
had an engagement party yet.

19:57.829 --> 20:00.832
Maybe I might just need
to tell Princess right now

20:00.899 --> 20:02.301
while we getting
the cars wrapped

20:02.367 --> 20:04.169
and getting the rims
put on the whips.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.204
It might lighten the mood.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.840
{\an5}All I need is
the diamonds right here
and I will be good to go.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.976
{\an1}With all that ass,
you gonna get all you want.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.544
Be quiet.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.713
{\an8}I'm not sure why Ray decided
to all of a sudden

20:14.780 --> 20:17.683
{\an8}get my car custom-wrapped,
but I'm not complaining.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.985
Ray and I are in
a really good place right now.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.321
We've cleaned up our act,
we've both stopped drinking,

20:22.387 --> 20:24.556
and we've been more focused
on our relationship.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.558
{\an1}I'm happy we in sync,
like me and you,

20:26.625 --> 20:28.393
{\an1}we, like, on the same page,
you know what I'm saying?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.495
{\an1}And I never want to make you
mad, you know what I'm saying?

20:30.562 --> 20:31.897
So are you about
to make me mad?

20:31.964 --> 20:34.032
{\an1}No. Like, at the end of the day,
I wanna make you happy.

20:34.099 --> 20:37.703
But at the same time,
I just wanted to know

20:37.769 --> 20:40.339
what you thought
about a prenup.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.410
Like, where
is this coming from?

20:45.477 --> 20:46.912
I talked to Moms,

20:46.979 --> 20:48.146
and she mentioned it to me,

20:48.213 --> 20:50.515
and I mention it to you
because I do feel like

20:50.582 --> 20:53.251
{\an1}we love each other and I want
to protect both of us.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.621
{\an1}But I don't feel like this
is you that wants the prenup,

20:55.687 --> 20:59.191
I feel like
it's coming from...

20:59.257 --> 21:00.325
{\an3}Mrs. Sonja.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.827
She mentioned it to me.

21:01.893 --> 21:03.495
{\an1}It's almost like we're
getting ready to get divorced

21:03.562 --> 21:04.963
before we even get married.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.399
But I feel like we gotta get
to the bottom or something--

21:07.466 --> 21:09.067
You don't feel like we're
gonna be together forever?

21:09.134 --> 21:11.436
{\an1}I feel like we gonna be
together forever and ever.

21:11.503 --> 21:12.671
But just in case...

21:12.738 --> 21:14.606
{\an1}But just in case, nothing.
This is your--

21:14.673 --> 21:16.341
That's what this is,
a just-in-case.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.443
{\an1}That's not what--
Just in case nothing of nothing.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.079
Now, all this is sounding
like a bunch of B.S. to me.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.148
I know Ray's mother
is at the center of this.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.550
Now, let's make this real clear.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.953
Sonja is not walking down
the aisle with us,

21:28.020 --> 21:29.721
so she needs
to stay in her place

21:29.788 --> 21:31.957
or I'm calling
this whole wedding off.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.093
I do not want
to sign a prenup.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.963
I'm against it 100%,

21:38.030 --> 21:40.265
so looks like you have
something to figure out.

21:40.332 --> 21:43.035
{\an5}(Ray J)
To go against my mom
and the woman I love

21:43.101 --> 21:45.203
is a problem,
and it's emotional.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.406
To prenup or not to prenup?

21:47.472 --> 21:49.141
That's the question.

engine starts)

22:12.064 --> 22:14.633
Me and Nikki have been
seeing each other on and off

22:14.700 --> 22:17.469
for a while now, you know,
when she has the time,

22:17.536 --> 22:19.938
but I want to see where this
thing is going, you know,

22:20.005 --> 22:21.473
if it's something real
or if it's something

22:21.540 --> 22:23.008
that we should just
leave in the past.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.043
You look cute today.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.044
You like my dress?

22:26.111 --> 22:27.846
Yeah, it's sexy.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.114
{\an1}(laughing)

22:29.181 --> 22:30.716
You don't look like
you miss me.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.184
I miss you,
but you don't miss me.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.418
{\an5}I do miss you.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.418
That's how I feel right now.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.886
{\an5}Why you feel like that?

22:33.485 --> 22:34.886
I don't know.

22:34.953 --> 22:36.421
{\an1}Are you being sensitive
right now?

22:36.488 --> 22:37.522
{\an1}I'm not getting the "miss you"
vibe, you know?

22:37.589 --> 22:39.057
{\an5}Are you serious?

22:37.589 --> 22:39.057
I'm getting the--

22:39.124 --> 22:40.992
{\an1}I'm getting the "I'm tired
of seeing you" vibe right now.

22:41.059 --> 22:42.327
I was just with you.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.396
One day a week
is not good enough for me.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.198
{\an1}I'm just dating.
I'm single.

22:46.264 --> 22:47.399
I'm just trying to see

22:47.466 --> 22:49.501
{\an1}if I want to be
with somebody, what I want,

22:49.568 --> 22:51.737
{\an4}what it is that
attracts me to somebody,
what it is that doesn't.

22:51.803 --> 22:53.505
{\an1}Like, I'm just
exploring right now.

22:53.572 --> 22:55.941
So, that's where we at.

22:56.007 --> 22:59.311
{\an5}(Nikki)
I have no clue where all this
future talk is coming from.

22:59.377 --> 23:01.680
{\an8}Fizz and I have both
been dating other people,

23:01.747 --> 23:04.149
{\an8}and don't get me wrong,
we have a great time together,

23:04.216 --> 23:07.085
but I had no idea that he was
trying to get serious.

23:07.152 --> 23:09.221
{\an1}I mean, what is it
that you want?

23:09.287 --> 23:11.256
{\an1}Like, are you looking
to settle down right now,

23:11.323 --> 23:12.424
or what is it
that you want?

23:12.491 --> 23:13.759
I definitely want
to settle down.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.727
I'm not trying to,
like...

23:15.794 --> 23:16.895
{\an1}I think you have
a great time with me

23:16.962 --> 23:18.196
{\an1}and I have a great time
with you,

23:18.263 --> 23:21.299
{\an1}and I know we vibe
and have the feelings there.

23:21.366 --> 23:23.735
{\an1}I just want to take things
a step at a time.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.270
I get what I want, though.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.772
{\an1}Okay.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.007
{\an1}Do you want my,
like, key?

23:29.074 --> 23:30.575
{\an1}I do, I want a key,
I want to be able to come in.

23:30.642 --> 23:31.810
Well, I want a key, too.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.112
{\an3}No. Let's--

23:34.179 --> 23:35.881
Let's hold off on that
for a minute.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.415
{\an1}Why? You got a girl
living with you or something?

23:37.482 --> 23:39.117
We taking baby steps,
remember?

23:39.184 --> 23:40.452
{\an5}Exactly, that's fine.

23:39.184 --> 23:40.452
{\an3}You know?

23:40.519 --> 23:42.754
As long as you don't live
with no girl, that's okay.

23:44.456 --> 23:46.191
{\an5}(Fizz)
I haven't broken the news
to Nikki yet

23:46.258 --> 23:49.327
about me living with Moniece,
but when she actually opens up

23:49.394 --> 23:51.663
and shows me that she's serious
about this relationship,

23:51.730 --> 23:53.265
then I'll do the same.

23:53.331 --> 23:54.966
Give me your key.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.868
{\an1}We'll take that
another time, too.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.303
{\an6}Oh, word?

23:56.935 --> 23:58.303
You know, since we
taking baby steps.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.572
{\an3}Baby steps.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.640
Baby steps.

24:01.706 --> 24:02.741
(chuckling)

24:03.942 --> 24:05.577
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up...

24:05.644 --> 24:06.945
{\an8}My wife working with
this producer Blaze,

24:07.012 --> 24:08.580
{\an8}and the only problem is,
in the past,

24:08.647 --> 24:09.981
{\an8}he took a couple shots
at her.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.617
{\an7}By default, we gotta go
check out this situation.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.287
{\an8}I am just confused
as to how you could

24:15.353 --> 24:17.222
{\an8}be serious with someone.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.224
{\an8}Why is he living with me?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.293
{\an8}Why is he not
living with you?

24:21.359 --> 24:23.395
{\an7}I'm not gonna be okay
with a man that I'm talking to

24:23.461 --> 24:24.729
{\an8}living with his baby mama.

24:31.269 --> 24:33.538
♪♪

24:37.642 --> 24:39.211
Okay, Lil Fizz.

24:39.277 --> 24:40.779
{\an5}(Soulja Boy)
Yo, what it do, man,
it's Soulja Boy.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.648
I'm back, I'm feeling
like $25 million.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.418
{\an5}Me and Nia,
we better than ever,
you know what I'm saying,

24:46.484 --> 24:48.220
you know we had
to work everything out.

24:48.286 --> 24:51.489
You know, my new album is about
to drop, I'm feeling great.

24:51.556 --> 24:54.492
It's your boy Soulja Boy, taking
over the world, baby, let's go.

24:54.559 --> 24:55.727
Y'all might
got me on the court,

24:55.794 --> 24:57.829
but come (bleep) with me
on the 2K, though.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.397
{\an5}PlayStation?

24:57.896 --> 24:59.397
Nah, you don't want that.

24:59.464 --> 25:01.633
I'm gonna stand a way better
chance on the video game.

25:01.700 --> 25:02.901
I'm playing 21, bruh.

25:02.968 --> 25:04.269
{\an8}Y'all got it, 2K?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.670
{\an8}It's all Soulja.

25:05.737 --> 25:07.172
{\an8}Man, what's been up?

25:07.239 --> 25:08.773
{\an8}Nothing, just working, man,
you know what I'm saying?

25:08.840 --> 25:10.308
I just released that project,
"Stacks on Deck," you feel me?

25:10.375 --> 25:12.677
{\an5}It's been going good.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.677
That's nice.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.312
But, nah, though, Willie.
How you been, though, bruh?

25:14.379 --> 25:15.714
{\an5}You been good?

25:14.379 --> 25:15.714
Man, I'm good, man.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.315
I just been working on
getting everything

25:17.382 --> 25:18.984
straight for
the home front.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.418
{\an5}Need it.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.418
So it allowed my wife

25:20.485 --> 25:21.753
to be able to do
her thing, man,

25:21.820 --> 25:23.054
so she back in the music
and (bleep),

25:23.121 --> 25:24.589
doing her thing, man,
'cause when we met--

25:24.656 --> 25:25.824
What's up with her?

25:25.891 --> 25:27.359
She working with
this producer, Blaze.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.927
Real dope producer,
man, and they vibe

25:28.994 --> 25:31.162
{\an1}and they chemistry, I mean,
as far as musically, is dope.

25:31.229 --> 25:32.797
The only problem is, man,
in the past,

25:32.864 --> 25:34.799
{\an1}he took a couple shots at her,
you know what I mean?

25:34.866 --> 25:36.401
On some try to get
with her type (bleep).

25:36.468 --> 25:37.936
{\an5}Whaaat?

25:36.468 --> 25:37.936
{\an3}Right.

25:38.003 --> 25:39.571
{\an5}So it's like...

25:38.003 --> 25:39.571
{\an1}Come on.

25:39.638 --> 25:41.339
{\an5}(Willie)
I knew the fellas would get
where I'm coming from.

25:41.406 --> 25:42.741
{\an8}I know they been in the game
for a long time,

25:42.807 --> 25:44.442
{\an8}and I really want to see
what they got to say

25:44.509 --> 25:46.711
{\an8}about relationships
with women in the industry.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.179
I got a couple concerns.

25:48.246 --> 25:49.981
She told me everything was
cool, she said she got it.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.716
{\an1}But I mean, you can't do
nothing but trust your wife.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.451
Exactly, and that's what
I'm trying to do, man,

25:53.518 --> 25:54.686
but I know-- I know
how (bleep)--

25:54.753 --> 25:56.154
You know him?
Who is he? You know him?

25:56.221 --> 25:57.489
I know him, I'm just
trying to figure out,

25:57.555 --> 25:59.991
man, should I trust
the situation?

26:00.058 --> 26:01.426
Should I sit back
and let her be an artist?

26:01.493 --> 26:02.894
She said she got it.

26:02.961 --> 26:04.663
Or should I
even go in there

26:04.729 --> 26:06.131
{\an5}and let him know
what the (bleep)
I'm talking about?

26:06.197 --> 26:07.766
By default, we gotta
go check out this situation.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.370
Even if you is tripping, it show
you that you love her, though.

26:12.437 --> 26:14.739
{\an1}Yeah. "Hey, baby, but, uh,
you know I love you, though.

26:14.806 --> 26:16.141
{\an5}I was coming through..."

26:14.806 --> 26:16.141
After that,

26:16.207 --> 26:17.709
there's something else,
you already know what it is.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.377
{\an4}Bop, bop!

26:17.776 --> 26:19.377
(laughter)

26:19.444 --> 26:20.979
We have nothing left
to talk about, fam.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.747
{\an4}Yeah.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.747
Yeah, exactly.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.050
Last thing I want my wife to do
is feel like I don't trust her.

26:25.116 --> 26:26.885
In this situation,
I don't trust him.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.253
And maybe Soulja's right.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.788
Maybe I do need
to roll up on him

26:29.854 --> 26:31.489
and just let him know
how I feel.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.258
Good to chop it up
with y'all, man.

26:33.325 --> 26:34.793
{\an5}Y'all ain't gonna do me
like that on that court
like that again.

26:34.859 --> 26:35.994
{\an3}Go, boy!

26:41.900 --> 26:43.902
{\an8}(Teairra)
Both Nikki and Moniece
are my friends,

26:43.969 --> 26:46.604
so when they got into it
last year over Richie D,

26:46.671 --> 26:48.406
it made me feel
really awkward.

26:48.473 --> 26:49.741
But at the end of the day,

26:49.808 --> 26:51.009
{\an8}Rich was playing Moniece

26:51.076 --> 26:52.911
{\an8}and Nikki brought light
to that situation.

26:52.978 --> 26:54.980
{\an8}So there really shouldn't be
any beef anymore.

26:55.046 --> 26:58.316
So I decided to bring these two
together and squash this (bleep)

26:58.383 --> 27:00.986
so I don't have to walk on
eggshells around my friends.

27:01.052 --> 27:03.088
(singsong)
Finally.

27:03.154 --> 27:04.289
Did you miss me or what?

27:04.356 --> 27:06.124
I missed you so much.
Give me a hug.

27:06.191 --> 27:09.327
{\an5}You look pretty.

27:06.191 --> 27:09.327
You look pretty, too.

27:09.394 --> 27:11.997
{\an5}(Nikki)
Teairra has called Moniece
and I together for drinks

27:12.063 --> 27:13.865
and to have this meeting
with each other,

27:13.932 --> 27:15.800
and, honestly,
I'm not looking for friends.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.836
{\an8}But if Dreux and I are gonna
continue to see each other,

27:17.902 --> 27:19.704
{\an8}I'm sure we're
gonna cross paths.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.740
I'm happy that
you were open to

27:21.806 --> 27:23.842
want to reconcile
the situation.

27:23.908 --> 27:25.110
{\an1}Yeah, trying to be
peaceful, honey.

27:25.176 --> 27:26.611
Yeah, me too.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.113
Hey.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.050
Hey. Ooh.
Look at you.

27:32.117 --> 27:35.020
{\an5}(Moniece)
I definitely appreciate Teairra
trying to play peacemaker

27:35.086 --> 27:36.955
between me
and Miss Botched Barbie,

27:37.022 --> 27:38.890
{\an8}especially because the last time
we saw each other,

27:38.957 --> 27:41.226
{\an8}it was a complete (bleep) show.

27:41.292 --> 27:44.295
However, if I don't like
what she has to say,

27:44.362 --> 27:46.564
Miss Mattel will be
leaving here

27:46.631 --> 27:49.601
without her legs
or her arms.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.370
I wanted you guys to talk,
'cause I know that you guys

27:52.437 --> 27:54.339
didn't leave
on the best of terms.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.775
So I know you were
very vocal in saying...

27:56.841 --> 27:58.543
Well, this is the thing.

27:58.610 --> 27:59.944
{\an1}I feel like her and I
had a misunderstanding,

28:00.011 --> 28:03.081
{\an1}and I feel like I do deal
with Dreux, and you do, too.

28:03.148 --> 28:05.083
You're always gonna be in his
life, so it's like, you know,

28:05.150 --> 28:06.751
we definitely should
have a conversation,

28:06.818 --> 28:08.219
{\an1}because the way things
ended last time

28:08.286 --> 28:10.388
was just all the way crazy.

28:10.455 --> 28:11.656
{\an1}And it shouldn't
have been like that.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.625
Well, I'm just not
in a space in my life

28:13.691 --> 28:16.694
to harbor hate
towards anybody.

28:16.761 --> 28:19.197
Now, that's the Moniece
that I fell in love with,

28:19.264 --> 28:21.900
the one who's positive and
doesn't have time for any B.S.

28:21.966 --> 28:23.234
Based off of the Twitter bombs

28:23.301 --> 28:24.636
that this bitch
has been dropping,

28:24.702 --> 28:27.238
I wasn't sure that
that was the Moniece

28:27.305 --> 28:28.706
that I was gonna get tonight.

28:28.773 --> 28:30.875
{\an1}You know, the way
(bleep) ended was crazy,

28:30.942 --> 28:32.277
{\an1}and I was like,
"You know, let me reach out,"

28:32.343 --> 28:34.245
{\an1}because that's me
being an adult.

28:34.312 --> 28:37.115
{\an1}And let me just see what--
where the mishap was.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.284
I think the mishap
was with Rich, though.

28:39.350 --> 28:42.020
{\an5}Yeah, but...

28:39.350 --> 28:42.020
Yeah, but even with that,

28:42.087 --> 28:43.121
like, Rich
was looking for a way

28:43.188 --> 28:44.589
out of the relationship.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.325
That opportunity
was a golden opportunity.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.527
{\an1}You letting him know
that I had spoken to Dreux,

28:49.594 --> 28:51.229
that was Rich
looking for...

28:51.296 --> 28:53.364
{\an6}a way out.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.364
A way out, I get it.

28:53.431 --> 28:55.867
{\an4}We don't have to be friends,
we never have to talk
a day in our lives.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.302
{\an1}But even if we don't
like each other,

28:57.368 --> 29:00.205
{\an1}I want us to respect each other,
because Dreux and I are,

29:00.271 --> 29:02.240
{\an1}you know, moving on,
trying to figure things out

29:02.307 --> 29:04.075
{\an1}and being more serious,
so you know, I just want us

29:04.142 --> 29:06.277
{\an1}to have a mutual understanding
with one another.

29:06.344 --> 29:08.313
So I'm just confused
as to how you could

29:08.379 --> 29:10.381
be serious
with someone.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.217
Why is he
living with me?

29:12.283 --> 29:14.586
Why is he not
living with you?

29:14.652 --> 29:15.687
{\an1}I didn't know you guys
lived together.

29:15.753 --> 29:17.388
Yeah, he moved in with me.

29:17.455 --> 29:18.790
(Nikki)
What the (bleep)?

29:18.857 --> 29:20.725
I would never let
another bitch see me sweat,

29:20.792 --> 29:22.427
but I will have my words
with Dreux.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.562
He's damn near begging me
to be his girlfriend.

29:24.629 --> 29:26.498
Meanwhile,
he's living with Moniece?

29:26.564 --> 29:28.066
Did you forget
to mention that part?

29:28.133 --> 29:29.667
{\an1}I'm not gonna be okay
with a man

29:29.734 --> 29:31.936
{\an1}that I'm talking to
living with his baby mama.

29:32.003 --> 29:33.304
{\an1}And not even if you guys
sleep together,

29:33.371 --> 29:34.472
whatever it is y'all do.

29:34.539 --> 29:35.640
My monkey doesn't
want his banana,

29:35.707 --> 29:36.941
it can stay with the bunch.

29:37.008 --> 29:40.912
{\an1}The only thing I want
from him is a vial of sperm.

29:40.979 --> 29:45.250
Wait, so, see, that is something
that's crazy as (bleep).

29:45.316 --> 29:46.684
Even though the baby daddy
drives me crazy,

29:46.751 --> 29:48.920
I can't stop thinking
about what a great dad he is

29:48.987 --> 29:51.990
and how he'd be a great dad
to a new baby.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.492
So I figured I would
keep it simple,

29:54.559 --> 29:56.528
and instead of bringing
a new baby daddy into the mix

29:56.594 --> 29:58.129
I would just go
to my old baby daddy.

29:58.196 --> 29:59.430
Are you kidding?

29:59.497 --> 30:01.466
I want my kids
to look alike,

30:01.533 --> 30:02.800
have the same
last name.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.435
I would feel a way
about that.

30:04.502 --> 30:05.870
What the hell?

30:05.937 --> 30:07.872
I brought these two hoes here
together to make peace,

30:07.939 --> 30:10.408
but if I was Nikki,
my drink would be

30:10.475 --> 30:13.511
flying at Moniece
faster than you can say "sperm."

30:13.578 --> 30:16.414
A part of me feels like,
"(bleep), you owe me."

30:16.481 --> 30:17.715
I'm pushing 30,

30:17.782 --> 30:19.350
and I'm starting
to have baby fever.

30:19.417 --> 30:20.818
Well, meet
somebody else, bitch!

30:20.885 --> 30:22.487
What do you mean
meet somebody else?

30:22.554 --> 30:24.189
{\an5}I could meet
somebody else.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.189
What I said!

30:24.255 --> 30:26.391
But I want my babies
to look alike.

30:26.457 --> 30:27.659
{\an1}Well, you gotta have a man
be there for your child.

30:27.725 --> 30:29.394

I don't need that.

I really don't care
what she got to say.

that this man stood in my face

30:37.702 --> 30:40.572

some type of explanation.

{\an8}more time with me
and building things,

31:27.252 --> 31:28.620
{\an8}but he forgot to mention to me

{\an8}that he's living

31:30.121 --> 31:32.991
So I set up a date real quick,

I am, brought him some presents.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.564
I'm a boss, and the men
I date are bosses,

so if they don't have

they'll have
several other options

I'm a little confused
by all this right now

32:04.289 --> 32:06.624

exclusive with me
or, you know,

32:08.359 --> 32:09.794

or anything.

32:09.861 --> 32:12.330
We talk on text,

I had to move

Obviously, you might not
watch the news,

because it was
a state of emergency.

that she wants to get his sperm

{\an8}this is the girl that you
basically gotta

33:11.356 --> 33:14.459
{\an8}schedule an appointment with

33:14.525 --> 33:16.461

to be an open book,

33:16.527 --> 33:18.429
she should have acted like
she gave a (bleep)

face to face, I said,

{\an4}I said, "Let's have fun
and figure it out."

33:35.513 --> 33:36.914
{\an3}Exactly.

33:36.981 --> 33:38.583

35:47.211 --> 35:48.946
she gets a chance
to get back in the game

35:49.013 --> 35:50.548
over some (bleep)
that happened in the past.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.617
Instead, I decided to book
some studio time of my own.

35:52.683 --> 35:55.419
<i>♪ I had my options ♪</i>

35:58.789 --> 36:00.258
I don't want Blaze
all in my business,

36:00.324 --> 36:02.927
so I asked her if we could
step into the next room

36:02.994 --> 36:05.997
so she could tell me about what
my "husband"'s been doing.

36:06.063 --> 36:07.999
So it's some things
that you do need to know

36:08.065 --> 36:10.101
about how when Willie
come in Chicago.

36:10.167 --> 36:13.671
{\an4}Okay.

36:10.167 --> 36:13.671
How he is contacting me.

36:13.738 --> 36:17.441
So, if you wanna see this,
what your husband is doing.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.510
{\an5}(Shanda)
Willie's definitely been talking
to this ratchet-ass bitch.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.245
She brought me text messages.

36:21.312 --> 36:22.747
That's definitely
his phone number,

36:22.813 --> 36:25.316
along with a picture
of himself in his boxers.

36:25.383 --> 36:26.684
How dumb can you be?

36:26.751 --> 36:29.320
If Willie (bleep)
with this ratchet-ass bitch,

36:29.387 --> 36:31.255
I swear to God...

36:31.322 --> 36:33.124
I'm gonna bury that mofo.

36:33.190 --> 36:34.825
It's a lot of things
that you don't know.

36:34.892 --> 36:36.294
Okay, but you know what?

36:36.360 --> 36:37.862
{\an1}And the reason why your
husband is contacting me...

36:37.929 --> 36:39.330
we're still (bleep).

36:39.397 --> 36:41.499
{\an8}Willie and I was dating
12 years ago,

36:41.566 --> 36:43.301
{\an8}way before he even met Shanda.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.936
{\an8}But when me and him broke up,

36:45.002 --> 36:47.505
{\an8}we never stopped (bleep).

36:47.572 --> 36:48.873
I came to L.A.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.375
to show Shanda who her man
really in love with.

36:51.442 --> 36:53.544
It ain't you, boo.
It's me.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.346
So I'll take your folder,

36:55.413 --> 36:56.814
{\an1}and I'll take
all of your proof...

36:56.881 --> 36:58.149
That's just what it is,
and the fact that you

36:58.215 --> 36:59.216
didn't even know that
he tried to leave you

36:59.283 --> 37:02.086
when you was pregnant.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.287
And tried to get back
with me.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.623
{\an1}Okay, well...
We're still married, sweetie.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.124
{\an6}Oh...

37:05.690 --> 37:07.124
{\an1}Okay.

37:07.191 --> 37:08.693
{\an1}I want to talk to him
about it first.

37:08.759 --> 37:11.162
As a woman, I always wanted
to be fair to another woman,

37:11.228 --> 37:12.797
to hear her out,
because if it's true,

37:12.863 --> 37:14.098
I'm dealing with my husband.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.833
This bitch
don't owe me (bleep).

37:15.900 --> 37:18.369
{\an4}Let's talk about it,
'cause I would love to hear
what Willie has to say.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.371
Call him, call him up,
bring him on out here.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.472
{\an5}Okay, baby.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.472
{\an3}All right?

After this bum bitch accused
Willie of cheating on me

37:54.905 --> 37:57.074
with her, I didn't want
to believe it.

37:57.141 --> 37:59.010
But after I read
the text messages,

37:59.076 --> 38:00.878
it was all undeniable.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.514
I'm not the kind of woman
