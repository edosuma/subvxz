in that shithole with us?

45:43.795 --> 45:45.216
Finley, you want
to maybe sit down?

45:45.316 --> 45:48.756
Oh, you're-you're fucking here?

45:49.997 --> 45:52.097
Oh, you guys are together!

45:52.197 --> 45:54.618
That's great.
That-that makes sense.

45:54.718 --> 45:56.098
That's-- it fits. It's good.

45:56.198 --> 45:58.219
Okay, I'm gonna get you
some water.

45:58.319 --> 46:01.340
'Cause you're, you know,
you're both very hot. [mutters]

46:01.440 --> 46:04.340
Um, what's going on?
Are you okay?

46:04.440 --> 46:06.541
Me? No, I'm totally great, bro.

46:06.641 --> 46:09.181
What are you...?
[scoffs] Of course.

46:09.281 --> 46:11.602
God, you're so pretty.

46:13.803 --> 46:16.983
Mm. Look, listen. You, too.

46:17.083 --> 46:19.984
Remember when you said you
don't have your shit together?

46:20.084 --> 46:22.785
Remember that...?

46:22.885 --> 46:25.025
I mean, look at this place.

46:25.125 --> 46:27.306
You got everything.

46:27.406 --> 46:29.306
I got nothing.

-That's-that's not true.
-What?

46:31.407 --> 46:33.107
Tell me, tell me what I got.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.748
Hey, careful.

46:35.848 --> 46:38.269
Oh, shit.

46:38.369 --> 46:40.509
-That look. That-that...
-What?

46:40.609 --> 46:44.270
That's the look Sophie gives me.

46:44.370 --> 46:46.391
How do I get her to stop
looking at me like that?

46:46.491 --> 46:48.111
Here. Take this.

46:48.211 --> 46:52.392
She... she says I'm scary.

46:52.492 --> 46:54.953
Okay, you're-you're
really drunk right now.

46:55.053 --> 46:57.753
How am I scary? I'm not scary.

46:57.853 --> 47:00.194
I'm-I'm fun Finley.

47:05.175 --> 47:06.436
I don't--

scared of me, huh?
