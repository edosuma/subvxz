00:54.999 --> 00:58.269
- Ambassador.
- Savage.

00:58.337 --> 01:00.258
As head of security
for the Reach,

01:00.297 --> 01:04.742
I must insist no masks
be worn at the summit.

01:04.811 --> 01:08.081
Simply because you insist
is no guarantee.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.916
Manta, if you wouldn't mind.

01:10.984 --> 01:13.552
After all,
we are among friends.

01:20.434 --> 01:24.118
- We are so in over our heads.
- Shh.

01:26.401 --> 01:28.103
Satisfied?

01:29.603 --> 01:33.646
Excellent. Then with these
formalities out of the way...

01:33.690 --> 01:36.058
...Let us begin.

01:39.467 --> 01:44.358
<b>Season 2: Invasion</b>
Episode 19: "Summit"

01:44.473 --> 01:47.473
Sync & corrections: Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:47.639 --> 01:51.653
And the rest of the Light?
Won't they be joining us?

01:51.682 --> 01:55.318
Our more public members
are occupied,

01:55.362 --> 02:00.131
conducting damage control
to mitigate your recent defeats.

02:00.199 --> 02:04.135
And in any case,
we are sufficient.

02:04.203 --> 02:05.436
Fine.

02:05.504 --> 02:07.806
I know you called this summit,

02:07.873 --> 02:11.309
but the Reach has come with grievances
against the Light.

02:11.377 --> 02:14.445
Please explain how
the young Earth champions

02:14.513 --> 02:18.903
were allowed access to the Bialyan
scarab temple under your control?

02:18.927 --> 02:22.419
- If I may respond...
- No, you may not.

02:22.487 --> 02:25.755
Manta, keep
your whelp meat silent.

02:25.823 --> 02:30.347
Beetle, your insolence grows
progressively less... Charming.

02:30.394 --> 02:32.950
My friends,
I think we can all agree

02:32.997 --> 02:36.226
that in recent days,
no one has done more,

02:36.265 --> 02:40.653
sacrificed more, for both
the Light and the Reach

02:40.692 --> 02:42.085
than Kaldur'ahm.

02:42.108 --> 02:46.056
That is why he was entrusted
with security for this summit.

02:46.101 --> 02:48.869
And why he's entitled
to a voice here.

02:48.937 --> 02:52.306
Of course.
He may speak.

02:52.374 --> 02:54.419
Thank you, Ambassador.

02:54.728 --> 02:59.009
We acknowledge your concerns
over the actions of my former team.

02:59.056 --> 03:01.895
But you must acknowledge that
the Light could not have known

03:01.962 --> 03:03.496
the significance of the temple,

03:03.564 --> 03:05.632
or that ancient Earth magic
could overcome

03:05.700 --> 03:10.108
Reach technology to free Blue Beetle
and Green Beetle from your thrall.

03:10.134 --> 03:12.504
If the Reach had been
more forthcoming

03:12.535 --> 03:17.310
about how long ago their scarab was sent
to infiltrate Earth with a beetle warrior,

03:17.378 --> 03:19.866
the Light have made
the connection to the temple,

03:19.897 --> 03:22.983
and certainly would have
provided better security for it.

03:23.050 --> 03:26.312
I told you, I wanted to study
how Blue Beetle scarab

03:26.351 --> 03:29.389
had crashed prior
to putting it back on mode.

03:29.457 --> 03:33.065
If you had followed my advice, we would
have known about the temple, and...

03:33.104 --> 03:35.326
Ohh. Apologies.

03:35.365 --> 03:37.831
- I spoke out of turn.
- No, my dear.

03:37.898 --> 03:41.823
You were quite correct to call your
master's tactics into question.

03:41.893 --> 03:45.092
The Light has provided
everything the Reach required,

03:45.151 --> 03:48.507
and you aliens have let it
all slip away.

03:48.575 --> 03:53.212
I don't believe this is a productive
direction for our discussion.

03:53.256 --> 03:57.191
No? Your public approval
ratings are at a record low.

03:57.283 --> 03:59.351
As our sales of the Reach drink,

03:59.419 --> 04:01.834
which you had hoped
would enslave the populace.

04:01.873 --> 04:04.435
You allowed the young heroes
you kidnapped

04:04.467 --> 04:09.229
to be rescued by the very teenagers
whose meta-genes you enhanced...

04:09.297 --> 04:11.865
After allowing
their escape as well.

04:11.933 --> 04:15.869
Worst of all, Blue Beetle and Green
Beetle have slipped from your grasp

04:15.937 --> 04:19.539
and fallen into the hands
of the enemy, the Justice League.

04:19.607 --> 04:24.044
Rest assured, both Beetles
will soon return to the fold.

04:24.111 --> 04:27.604
In fact, Black Beetle has been
summoned to Earth from his post

04:27.636 --> 04:30.250
guarding access to the
Key Chamber on the Warworld...

04:30.318 --> 04:32.403
To kill Blue and Green.

04:32.426 --> 04:37.044
So that their scarabs may be reset
and installed upon new host bodies

04:37.098 --> 04:39.626
that will forever be slaves
to the Reach.

04:39.693 --> 04:43.463
So do not question us
on that score or any other.

04:43.530 --> 04:47.467
Remember, the Earth is now
the property of the Reach.

04:47.534 --> 04:49.502
And per our original agreement,

04:49.570 --> 04:53.673
the Light is merely our favored
agents amongst the humans.

04:53.741 --> 04:58.024
Show the proper respect,
or suffer the consequences.

04:58.055 --> 05:02.147
No agreement exists that
makes a slave of Black Manta.

05:02.214 --> 05:05.590
No agreement exists that guarantees
the life of Black Manta.

05:05.620 --> 05:08.388
Manta guarantees that himself.

05:10.756 --> 05:13.424
It seems we have a stand-off.

05:13.492 --> 05:15.691
No, we don't.

05:32.107 --> 05:33.708
Apologies, Great One.

05:33.775 --> 05:36.611
Not necessary, child.
You have my...

05:36.678 --> 05:38.711
Thanks.

05:51.566 --> 05:54.513
Enough!
We are allies, not enemies.

05:54.596 --> 05:58.733
Any conflict between us only
benefits our true opponents...

05:58.801 --> 06:01.781
The Justice League
and their sidekicks.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.014
Kaldur'ahm is quite correct.

06:04.045 --> 06:08.582
Agreed. We must not allow petty
disagreements to drive a wedge between us.

06:08.621 --> 06:10.622
Gratitude, Kaldur'ahm.

06:10.690 --> 06:12.974
- Stand down, warrior.
- Ambassador!

06:13.013 --> 06:14.894
Stand down.

06:26.107 --> 06:28.625
Should we not be concerned
that Superman, Batman,

06:28.656 --> 06:31.312
the Lanterns, and the rest
will soon return to Earth

06:31.379 --> 06:34.314
and once again sway
public opinion to their side?

06:34.382 --> 06:38.452
Superman and those accused with
him will never leave Rimbor.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.255
The attack we forced them
to make on that world,

06:41.323 --> 06:46.627
plus a few well placed bribes,
has guaranteed their convictions.

06:46.695 --> 06:51.198
And the Green Lanterns are forbidden by
Guardian treaty from returning to Earth

06:51.266 --> 06:55.902
now that we've convinced
U.N. Secretary Tseng to welcome us here.

06:55.970 --> 06:59.272
As for public opinion,
I wouldn't be concerned.

06:59.340 --> 07:02.308
Though the tide has turned
to a certain degree,

07:02.376 --> 07:06.278
it will be a simple matter to build
on the foundation of half-truths

07:06.306 --> 07:09.642
we have already used to discredit
the League in order to...

07:09.750 --> 07:12.476
Discredit them... Again.

07:12.531 --> 07:14.499
Great One?

07:23.564 --> 07:25.761
Artemis.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.362
I don't understand.
I thought Artemis was dead.

07:36.390 --> 07:40.857
So did we all, but it seems
Tigress is Artemis.

07:40.878 --> 07:45.281
This is a glamour charm, created
I'd wager by Zatanna or Doctor Fate

07:45.393 --> 07:47.628
to hide Artemis' true identity.

07:47.696 --> 07:50.802
But Kaldur'ahm killed Artemis.

07:50.840 --> 07:55.777
If she lives, and in disguise
as his lieutenant, then that means...

07:55.847 --> 08:02.585
That means Aqualad duped them all,
including his own father.

08:07.812 --> 08:10.388
Kill them both.

08:10.994 --> 08:14.959
- No! You will not kill my son!
<i>- He's right.</i>

08:20.672 --> 08:23.540
The Light takes care
of its own.

08:24.826 --> 08:28.011
- Kaldur.
- It's too late, father.

08:28.079 --> 08:32.015
I have already... Won.

08:37.355 --> 08:41.125
If you are watching this,
then your summit is truly over.

08:41.193 --> 08:43.828
The Light and the Reach
deserve each other.

08:43.895 --> 08:46.664
Both sides play
at being partners.

08:46.732 --> 08:51.035
But the Reach believes the Light
to be their naive tools of conquest,

08:51.103 --> 08:55.039
when in fact the Light has
manipulated the Reach from day one.

08:55.107 --> 08:57.609
- Shut this off.
- How?

08:57.677 --> 09:01.346
It was the Light that brought
Earth to the Reach's attention

09:01.414 --> 09:03.649
by sending the Justice League
to Rimbor.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.786
The Light set their trap, and
the Reach snapped at the bait,

09:06.854 --> 09:10.957
fulfilling the Light's desire to thrust
our world into the galactic spotlight.

09:11.025 --> 09:14.294
Part of their perverse <i>survival
of the fittest</i> scheme for the planet,

09:14.362 --> 09:17.063
which they believe will transform
the Earth and the Light

09:17.131 --> 09:19.466
into the eventual rulers
of the Milky Way.

09:19.534 --> 09:23.237
Though the Light made a deal
to help the Reach take Earth,

09:23.304 --> 09:26.135
they have also sabotaged
the Reach's efforts.

09:26.158 --> 09:28.976
They kept the advanced meta-genes
out of the Reach's hands.

09:29.044 --> 09:31.812
They added a neutralizing agent
to the Reach's drink

09:31.880 --> 09:34.815
so Earth's population
would not become servile.

09:34.883 --> 09:37.885
They turned public opinion
against the Reach,

09:37.952 --> 09:40.487
and they intentionally
allowed the Team access

09:40.555 --> 09:43.691
to the scarab temple
to cleanse Blue and Green Beetle.

09:43.758 --> 09:47.494
So, you see, any agenda either
side imagined they shared

09:47.562 --> 09:50.898
was nothing but a carefully
crafted illusion.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.533
I trust I have shattered
that illusion,

09:53.601 --> 09:57.504
as well as whatever remains
of this sorry alliance.

09:57.572 --> 09:59.506
Good night.

09:59.574 --> 10:02.710
Kaldur.
Kaldur, what have you done?

10:02.777 --> 10:05.913
He has in death
done more to damage my plans

10:05.980 --> 10:10.217
than any living creature
has wrought in 50,000 years.

10:10.285 --> 10:12.920
I'd be impressed
if I wasn't so...

10:12.988 --> 10:17.076
Aah! You Earthlings
are a pestilence and a plague!

10:17.123 --> 10:20.729
You dare sabotage us?!
Dare betray us?!

10:20.797 --> 10:23.931
Have you forgotten
who controls the Warworld?

10:23.999 --> 10:28.001
The Light is fortunate we do not
carve up your planet as we speak!

10:28.069 --> 10:32.939
That would indeed impress,
as I have the Warworld's Crystal Key.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.509
That is all I needed to know.

10:35.576 --> 10:39.612
- Kaldur, you're...
- Alive. Yes.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.814
If you would...?

10:42.616 --> 10:46.886
And I always heard
"The Great One" was such a gentleman.

10:46.953 --> 10:50.556
Impossible.
Deathstroke killed you both.

10:50.623 --> 10:52.190
Just for a little while.

10:52.258 --> 10:56.394
After all, I wouldn't want
to do any permanent damage...

10:56.462 --> 10:58.763
To my best friends.

10:58.831 --> 11:03.236
Not when a little misdirection and
Hollywood special effects will do instead.

11:03.303 --> 11:06.973
For we value our true friends,
and unlike you,

11:07.041 --> 11:09.810
we are not short on them.

11:14.649 --> 11:17.974
Hey there, Vandy.
You miss me?

11:18.302 --> 11:21.545
Well played. Well planned.

11:21.606 --> 11:25.475
But the Light always
has contingencies.

11:44.931 --> 11:48.016
I've had my fill
of your interference.

11:48.084 --> 11:51.253
Do not expect to survive.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.709
Kill them all.

12:01.777 --> 12:05.914
Superboy may present a problem,
but we'll deal with him

12:05.953 --> 12:09.857
when the other children
lie bleeding on the ground.

12:09.910 --> 12:12.712
Still you refer to us
as children.

12:12.780 --> 12:15.014
No wonder our
successes mount.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.750
You consistently
underestimate us.

13:16.052 --> 13:17.805
It is true.

13:17.848 --> 13:21.784
The Light has always
underestimated these young heroes.

13:21.852 --> 13:25.537
But no more.
It is time.

13:39.870 --> 13:41.603
Cowardly meat!

13:41.671 --> 13:45.206
No! Vandal has the right idea.
This battle is pointless.

13:45.235 --> 13:48.837
Do not resist. The heroes
have no jurisdiction here.

13:48.944 --> 13:53.414
Meaning every piece of meat
on the Light is a coward.

13:59.999 --> 14:02.201
Master!

14:02.559 --> 14:05.998
Such is the fate of all meat.

14:13.057 --> 14:16.159
I have you, Master.
Ubu will keep you safe.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.028
The Master
will be resurrected.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.852
I so want to kiss you now.

14:28.919 --> 14:31.341
Or maybe kill you for
putting us through all this.

14:31.356 --> 14:35.590
Hold that thought. You can
decide later, when we're alone.

14:39.731 --> 14:43.267
I cannot comprehend this betrayal, Kaldur.
How could you?

14:43.335 --> 14:47.672
I admit to being conflicted, father.
I have seen your noble side.

14:47.740 --> 14:50.108
But you left me no choice.

14:50.176 --> 14:52.678
As long was you waste
your gifts on villainy,

14:52.698 --> 14:54.766
I will stand against you.

14:54.818 --> 14:56.961
It seems I have been
too permissive.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.996
Clearly, boy, you require...

15:00.063 --> 15:02.202
Discipline.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.022
Thank you, La'gaan.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.030
Hey there, K.F.
Whatcha doing?

15:33.098 --> 15:35.032
Same old, same old.
Driving the bad guys nuts.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.300
Nice look, by the way.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.102
- Ha! You think?
- Yeah.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.805
Though, honestly, I always figured
you'd wind up in something

15:40.873 --> 15:42.607
with a little more
yellow and red.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.542
Heh. Seriously?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.611
Hey, once this whole
invasion thing's over,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.613
Artemis and I are going
back into retirement.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.115
Someone needs to carry on
the family tradition.

15:51.183 --> 15:53.451
Dude, that is so crash!

15:53.519 --> 15:55.420
You watch. I'll make
you proud. I'll...

15:55.487 --> 15:56.821
Start with the brain.

15:56.888 --> 15:58.989
What? Oh, right!

16:01.126 --> 16:03.060
♪ Ta-da! ♪

16:12.904 --> 16:16.740
Ignorant boy! This is not
a world, a universe,

16:16.808 --> 16:19.176
in which a free man
can afford to be soft.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.246
I will teach you to be ruthless,
Kaldur'ahm,

16:22.313 --> 16:25.582
Even if I must beat
that lesson into your skull!

16:54.277 --> 16:57.112
I believe that was
fairly ruthless, father.

16:57.179 --> 17:00.364
I hope it made you proud.

17:07.390 --> 17:09.490
Warrior!

17:13.561 --> 17:15.829
Hurry, Warrior. We must flee!

17:15.897 --> 17:20.300
Pathetic. Look at where your
machinations have left us.

17:20.368 --> 17:23.137
Free me at once.
That is an order!

17:23.204 --> 17:26.307
Your numerous failures
render all orders moot.

17:26.375 --> 17:30.145
Under article 16 of the Reach
planetary acquisition code,

17:30.212 --> 17:34.872
I officially declare you unfit
to lead this delegation.

17:34.904 --> 17:37.219
No. No!

17:37.287 --> 17:41.323
You might still be
of some use.

17:41.391 --> 17:43.154
Gratitude.

18:06.615 --> 18:08.855
I had hoped
to end this tonight,

18:08.886 --> 18:10.683
but Savage escaped,
with Klarion,

18:10.751 --> 18:13.553
as did Black Beetle and
the Reach's head scientist.

18:13.621 --> 18:15.488
Luther and Queen Bee
never showed,

18:15.556 --> 18:17.557
and even Ra's al Ghul
will no doubt...

18:17.625 --> 18:20.193
Are you kidding me?
Kaldur, you won!

18:20.261 --> 18:22.896
Won? Dude,
you triumphed!

18:22.963 --> 18:26.511
You've crippled the Reach and
literally broken the Light in half.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.769
Even took down Deathstroke
before the summit.

18:28.837 --> 18:31.861
And since we holographically
recorded the entire deal,

18:31.918 --> 18:34.153
we'll be able to use
the bad guys' own words

18:34.221 --> 18:36.222
against them to clear
the Justice League.

18:36.266 --> 18:41.536
- Huh! What was that?
- I'm still just so glad you're alive!

18:41.573 --> 18:43.741
And that Aqualad's
not a traitor!

18:43.864 --> 18:47.870
No more faking anyone's death
for at least a year, OK?

18:48.017 --> 18:49.450
Yeah, seconded.

18:49.870 --> 18:52.238
Agreed.

18:52.306 --> 18:54.574
Kaldur, this has been
a good night.

18:54.641 --> 18:57.043
Maybe the best we've had
since the 3 of us

18:57.111 --> 18:59.846
first took off for Cabniss
5-plus years ago.

18:59.914 --> 19:01.982
Come on.
Enjoy the moment, my friend.

19:02.049 --> 19:04.050
You've earned it.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.580
Was that a boom tube?

19:26.898 --> 19:29.734
Savage!

19:39.207 --> 19:43.276
I am now officially returning
command of the Team back to you.

19:43.344 --> 19:45.445
Congratulations, Kaldur'ahm.

19:45.513 --> 19:48.865
This is unnecessary.
You have done brilliant work

19:48.904 --> 19:51.785
leading the Team under
the most trying of circumstances.

19:51.853 --> 19:56.390
Which is exactly why I'm thrilled to have
this particular monkey off my back.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.525
Job's all yours, pal.

20:08.269 --> 20:10.203
The Warworld's been activated.

20:10.271 --> 20:13.640
It's leaving Earth's orbit,
heading out into space!

20:13.707 --> 20:16.843
Uh, is that good news or bad?

20:17.128 --> 20:20.096
Secretary General Tseng
has just completed

20:20.135 --> 20:22.625
an emergency session
of the United Nations.

20:22.672 --> 20:25.340
Captain Atom presented new
evidence that proves the Reach

20:25.407 --> 20:27.125
is not the benevolent
friend of Earth

20:27.151 --> 20:29.610
the aliens have portrayed
themselves to be.

20:29.678 --> 20:33.515
In fact, their goal seems
to have been conquest all along.

20:33.582 --> 20:35.918
After a unanimous vote,
Secretary Tseng

20:35.985 --> 20:39.551
officially rescinded the Reach's
invitation to stay on our world

20:39.571 --> 20:42.273
and demanded they leave
immediately.

20:42.459 --> 20:46.463
The Green Lantern Corps
will soon be on their way.

20:46.530 --> 20:50.634
The Warworld has left orbit,
I assume under the command of Savage.

20:50.702 --> 20:52.836
Then the entire summit
was merely a ploy

20:52.904 --> 20:56.040
to remove me from my post
guarding the Key Chamber.

20:56.108 --> 21:01.162
Fine. The meat can have their way.
The Reach will leave this world.

21:01.201 --> 21:03.214
But won't that
leave behind evidence

21:03.282 --> 21:05.850
of our tampering with
this planet in violation

21:05.918 --> 21:08.486
of our treaty with
the Guardians of the Universe?

21:08.554 --> 21:13.090
No, not after
we destroy the Earth.
