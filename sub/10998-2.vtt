09:11.176 --> 09:14.611
When I interviewed
Jeffrey for the magazine,

09:14.646 --> 09:18.047
I assumed he was
guilty... like everyone else...

09:18.083 --> 09:22.585
but I kept finding holes
in the prosecution's case,

09:22.621 --> 09:25.221
mistakes made by his legal team,

09:25.257 --> 09:27.090
And I just...

09:27.125 --> 09:28.324
You fell in love.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.860
I married him while
he was still in prison.

09:30.896 --> 09:32.362
Everyone thought I was crazy.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.934
Then, she spent all of her
time trying to get me out.

09:37.969 --> 09:40.003
And now, thanks to
her, I have my life back.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.105
But not really. We're being harassed.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.573
We're getting death threats,

09:43.608 --> 09:45.842
which is why I insisted we come to you.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.577
To track down the source of the threats?

09:47.612 --> 09:48.812
No.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.181
To find out who really
killed Edith Rockwell.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.019
Valerie: What do you think?

09:56.054 --> 09:57.854
I think Rebecca's gonna be really angry

09:57.889 --> 09:59.422
when she finds out her
husband killed Edith Rockwell.

09:59.458 --> 10:00.824
I need you to be objective.

10:00.859 --> 10:02.625
- I am.
- You're not.

10:02.661 --> 10:05.762
And if Gordon did to me what
Christopher did to you,

10:05.797 --> 10:07.497
I wouldn't be, either.

10:07.532 --> 10:09.332
I would need some serious time off.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.934
No, I'm not taking time off.

10:14.172 --> 10:17.173
He lied to me for a year.

10:17.209 --> 10:18.741
And I'm supposed to be good at this.

10:20.312 --> 10:22.479
I need to know that
I'm still good at this.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.489
We are taking this case.

10:36.276 --> 10:37.842
Eight years ago, Jeffrey Bloom came

10:37.878 --> 10:39.978
to L.A. as an aspiring print model,

10:40.046 --> 10:43.181
meaning he mostly waited
tables and taught spin classes,

10:43.216 --> 10:46.818
which is how he met
fashion designer Edith Rockwell.

10:46.887 --> 10:49.521
The fact that Edith was 40
years older than Jeffrey

10:49.556 --> 10:51.456
barely raised an eyebrow in Hollywood,

10:51.491 --> 10:54.158
but it was a red flag
to Edith's son, Payton,

10:54.194 --> 10:56.561
a UCLA philosophy major who didn't love

10:56.596 --> 10:58.530
that his soon-to-be-stepfather

10:58.565 --> 11:00.398
was only a few years older than he was.

11:00.433 --> 11:02.066
But Payton had an alibi
the night of the murder.

11:02.102 --> 11:03.668
He did. Her name is Tracy Lassin.

11:03.703 --> 11:05.403
Tracy: I'm telling
you what I told the cops...

11:05.438 --> 11:06.504
He was at the bar till last call.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.640
But that place is wall-to-wall
college boys.

11:08.675 --> 11:10.074
So, how do you remember Payton?

11:10.110 --> 11:11.576
'Cause college boys all look at me

11:11.611 --> 11:12.977
the same way you are right now.

11:13.013 --> 11:14.579
Yeah, they all want the same thing.

11:14.614 --> 11:18.383
But this guy, Payton, he
wanted to talk about his mom.

11:18.418 --> 11:20.151
So, what does Payton say?

11:20.186 --> 11:21.753
Nothing. I e-mailed, left messages.

11:21.788 --> 11:23.354
I showed up at his
doorstep and made nice,

11:23.390 --> 11:24.756
but he's not talking to anyone.

11:24.791 --> 11:28.626
So we start from
scratch... a new investigation, no bias.

11:28.662 --> 11:29.594
We look at everyone...

11:29.629 --> 11:31.029
anyone who might have held a grudge

11:31.031 --> 11:32.797
or had something to
gain from Edith's death.

11:32.832 --> 11:35.133
Whoever did it tried to
make it look like a robbery.

11:35.201 --> 11:37.435
She'd been strangled,
signs of a break-in,

11:37.470 --> 11:38.670
jewelry stolen.

11:38.705 --> 11:40.471
Can we get in to
examine the crime scene?

11:40.507 --> 11:41.940
As of now, Edith's house

11:41.975 --> 11:43.975
and all of her assets belong to Jeffrey.

11:44.010 --> 11:45.710
Shall we ask our new client for a tour?

11:48.648 --> 11:50.648
Jeffrey: That's where they found her,

11:50.684 --> 11:52.216
lying at the bottom of the stairs

11:52.252 --> 11:54.719
strangled with one of her own scarves.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.558
Jeffrey, you don't
have to be here for this

12:00.594 --> 12:01.693
- if you don't want.
- It's okay.

12:01.728 --> 12:03.361
You're okay, right?

12:03.396 --> 12:04.596
Yeah. I-I...

12:04.631 --> 12:07.398
I just haven't been back here since...

12:10.270 --> 12:12.303
Why don't we start upstairs?

12:12.339 --> 12:13.972
Sure.

12:19.412 --> 12:22.280
Jeffrey: This is Payton's room.

12:22.315 --> 12:24.282
Edith kept it exactly how he left it.

12:24.317 --> 12:26.050
She wanted to make sure he knew

12:26.086 --> 12:27.418
he would always have a home here.

12:27.454 --> 12:29.654
Then why did she cut
him out of her will?

12:32.158 --> 12:34.826
Honey, they can't help
you if you don't tell them.

12:35.862 --> 12:37.829
Look, Payton was a good kid,

12:37.864 --> 12:41.532
but he started cutting
classes and doing drugs,

12:41.568 --> 12:44.435
spending Edith's money, so she
figured she'd cut him off.

12:44.471 --> 12:45.837
But that only made things worse.

12:45.872 --> 12:46.771
How so?

12:47.941 --> 12:50.141
Payton threatened Edith
the night of the murder.

12:50.176 --> 12:51.442
He didn't threaten her.

12:51.478 --> 12:54.078
He said, "If you choose
Jeffrey over me, you'll regret it."

12:54.114 --> 12:56.280
- That's a threat.
- They had an argument.

12:56.316 --> 12:58.816
Payton said some thing he
shouldn't have, and he left.

12:58.852 --> 13:00.652
We were supposed to go
to the opera that night

13:00.654 --> 13:04.022
with friends, but Edith was so
upset she decided not to go.

13:04.057 --> 13:06.324
- And when I came back...
- Edith was dead.

13:06.359 --> 13:07.492
The police found signs of a break-in...

13:07.527 --> 13:09.961
a broken window, and
Edith's jewelry was gone.

13:09.996 --> 13:11.429
And you think Payton did it.

13:11.464 --> 13:12.664
He was high.

13:12.699 --> 13:14.198
He had been drinking at the bar.

13:14.234 --> 13:15.600
- He snapped.
- Rebecca.

13:15.635 --> 13:17.835
I'm sorry, but there's no other version

13:17.871 --> 13:19.937
of this story that makes any sense.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.473
Except the one that put me in prison.

13:26.946 --> 13:30.615
Passport. Cash... U.S., Chinese.

13:30.650 --> 13:32.917
I booked your usual
suite at the Ritz-Carlton,

13:32.952 --> 13:35.386
Tell Chef Daniel I'll
see you both in 30 days.

13:35.422 --> 13:37.088
I could stay here, lie low.

13:37.123 --> 13:38.923
You've been a delight, darling.

13:38.958 --> 13:39.924
Now be a ghost.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.959
Your town car awaits.

13:44.731 --> 13:45.697
You watched me pack.

13:45.765 --> 13:48.099
No, I watched you fold clothes.

13:48.134 --> 13:50.415
Is that what you're gonna
wear when you meet the princess?

13:50.437 --> 13:52.370
Don't concern yourself
with my wardrobe, okay?

13:52.405 --> 13:53.971
You just get your head together

13:54.007 --> 13:56.340
so I don't have to
worry about you anymore.

13:56.376 --> 13:59.177
Straight to the airport. No stops.

14:03.583 --> 14:04.982
[Door opens]

14:08.188 --> 14:09.120
[Door closes]

14:11.057 --> 14:13.725
So, according to
Jeffrey, Edith had no intention

14:13.760 --> 14:15.593
of disowning Payton, to the point

14:15.628 --> 14:17.595
where his room was,
like, scarily preserved.

14:17.630 --> 14:18.996
It was 2010 in there.

14:19.032 --> 14:20.164
But did you notice?

14:20.200 --> 14:22.400
There were no family
photos with Payton in them,

14:22.435 --> 14:23.935
like, anywhere in the house.

14:23.970 --> 14:25.269
I looked.

14:25.305 --> 14:27.171
It was all Jeffrey and Edith.

14:27.207 --> 14:29.807
So, either Edith got
rid of them, or Jeffrey did.

14:29.843 --> 14:31.008
Well...

14:31.044 --> 14:33.077
- I have photos of Payton.
- [Gasps]

14:33.113 --> 14:36.414
- Danny, you stole it.
- Liberated it from 2010.

14:36.449 --> 14:39.350
It's all Vampire
Weekend and "Avatar" on there.

14:39.385 --> 14:41.486
Enjoy.

14:41.521 --> 14:42.787
What?

14:42.822 --> 14:45.623
You still think Jeffrey killed her?

14:45.658 --> 14:47.892
I think finding the jewels
will help us figure it out.

14:47.927 --> 14:50.294
Here. You go up. I'll
be there in a second.

15:18.354 --> 15:20.655
Ms. Vaughan. Are you following me?

15:20.690 --> 15:22.557
[Vehicle approaching]

15:22.592 --> 15:23.724
[Tires screech]

15:24.794 --> 15:26.460
- Get in the car.
- Reggie, what are you doing?

15:26.496 --> 15:28.262
You are getting on that
plane if I have to fold you down

15:28.298 --> 15:30.731
to travel size and
check you in as baggage.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.400
I'm going. I'm leaving right now.

15:32.435 --> 15:33.634
When? Right after you
run across the street

15:33.670 --> 15:35.670
and apologize to her
for ruining her life?

15:35.705 --> 15:37.025
You think she's gonna forgive you?

15:37.040 --> 15:40.374
Ben, she's gonna stab you in
the chest with a car key.

15:42.545 --> 15:43.578
Get down.

15:45.715 --> 15:46.581
Oh, hell!

15:48.685 --> 15:50.585
What is Interpol doing here?

15:50.620 --> 15:52.954
Why is Interpol
talking to your girlfriend?

15:52.989 --> 15:55.289
He must have traced the
hits on her clients.

15:55.325 --> 15:57.258
We had to leave
Europe because of that guy.

15:57.293 --> 15:59.260
Now we have to leave
L.A.? No. I like L.A.

15:59.295 --> 16:01.329
We're not leaving L.A. We can't.

16:01.397 --> 16:03.798
If Dao's looking for me, he'll
have his men all over LAX.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.513
We're gonna have to
tell Margot about this.

16:06.869 --> 16:08.356
- [Engine starts]
- You've been tailing

16:08.381 --> 16:09.637
me since I left this morning.

16:09.672 --> 16:12.073
Am I suspect in this investigation?

16:12.108 --> 16:13.074
A person of interest?

16:13.109 --> 16:14.642
You're of great interest to me.

16:14.677 --> 16:17.378
I finally figured out why
you don't want to help me.

16:17.413 --> 16:19.680
Because the man I've
been chasing for two years

16:19.716 --> 16:23.618
was your fiancé, Christopher Hall.

16:27.423 --> 16:28.823
You were with him for one year.

16:28.858 --> 16:30.958
During that time, he stole $5 million

16:30.994 --> 16:33.127
from your clients using information

16:33.162 --> 16:35.162
he obtained from you.

16:35.198 --> 16:37.398
Now, to me and to a jury,

16:37.433 --> 16:39.367
it will look as if you
were in it together.

16:39.402 --> 16:42.236
So, if I call FBI
headquarters and tell your supervisor

16:42.271 --> 16:44.205
that you spent the
entire day following me

16:44.240 --> 16:45.740
instead of looking for this man,

16:45.775 --> 16:47.341
will he be surprised to hear that?

16:47.377 --> 16:50.544
You're supervisor's Max, right?

16:50.580 --> 16:52.546
Why don't we call him
right now and find out?

16:52.582 --> 16:53.881
Please do.

16:53.916 --> 16:55.316
I see you've gone from
living with thieves

16:55.351 --> 16:56.751
to working for murderers.

16:58.755 --> 17:02.156
I'm sure it won't be long
until we meet again, Ms. Vaughan.

17:04.894 --> 17:06.993
[Car door opens, closes]

17:07.030 --> 17:09.329
[Engine starts]

17:27.215 --> 17:29.417
- Mom's in New Mexico...
- Mm-hmm.

17:29.452 --> 17:31.519
With a husband number four, I think.

17:31.554 --> 17:33.854
- That is impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

17:33.890 --> 17:38.259
And Dad's retired in
Tucson with my baby brother,

17:38.294 --> 17:40.661
who's over 30 and still a baby.

17:40.697 --> 17:42.496
What does he do?

17:42.532 --> 17:43.731
Landscaping.

17:43.766 --> 17:45.900
I think...
sometimes. Maybe Internet porn.

17:45.935 --> 17:47.068
[Chuckling] It's unclear.

17:47.136 --> 17:48.335
[Both laugh]

17:48.371 --> 17:50.004
What about you?

17:52.909 --> 17:53.974
Parents are gone.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.645
Cancer.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.080
I'm sorry.

17:59.115 --> 18:01.615
Yeah, me, too. They were...

18:01.651 --> 18:02.983
both pretty great.

18:05.822 --> 18:08.155
Any siblings?

18:08.191 --> 18:09.223
An older brother.

18:09.258 --> 18:11.559
Yeah? Where's he? What does he do?

18:13.496 --> 18:14.795
He died when we were kids.

18:17.633 --> 18:18.866
It was a sailboat accident.

18:18.901 --> 18:22.470
We were, uh...

18:22.505 --> 18:24.205
It got windy, and the boat capsized,

18:24.240 --> 18:26.373
and he got caught in
the rigging underneath.

18:26.809 --> 18:30.544
[Breathes deeply, sighs]

18:30.580 --> 18:32.346
I'm sorry.

18:32.381 --> 18:34.949
No, I'm sorry. It's not...

18:34.984 --> 18:35.883
first-date material.

18:35.918 --> 18:37.952
No, please.

18:37.987 --> 18:39.320
I want to know.

18:41.424 --> 18:42.857
What do you want to know?

18:44.827 --> 18:46.093
Everything.

19:00.009 --> 19:02.409
Reggie, we need to go
tell Margot about this now.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.111
No, we need to get our story straight.

19:04.147 --> 19:05.746
<i>Not our story, my story.</i>

19:05.782 --> 19:07.681
I went to LAX, saw Agent Dao, came back.

19:07.717 --> 19:09.450
So, you're just gonna
trust that I won't tell her

19:09.485 --> 19:11.485
about you and Nancy Drew?

19:11.521 --> 19:13.320
You know what? Tell her.

19:13.356 --> 19:14.421
What?

19:14.457 --> 19:15.890
- Better yet, I'll tell her.
- Whoa. Calm down.

19:15.925 --> 19:17.091
She probably already knows.

19:17.126 --> 19:19.059
After 15 years
together, how could she not?

19:19.095 --> 19:21.095
Reggie, I love Margot. I
would do anything for her.

19:21.097 --> 19:22.730
You guys are my family. You know that.

19:22.765 --> 19:24.398
But I am in love with Alice Vaughan.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.634
I didn't mean for it to
happen. I didn't want it to happen.

19:26.669 --> 19:29.436
[Sighs] Okay, okay, okay.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.172
Look, I know you
feel this way right now.

19:31.207 --> 19:32.606
- Reggie...
- But feelings change.

19:32.642 --> 19:34.875

31:10.455 --> 31:11.620
that will help them find Payton.

31:11.689 --> 31:14.757
Well, he's not at his
house. He's not at the beach house.

31:14.792 --> 31:16.425
- Did they check Edith's?
- You think he's there?

31:16.461 --> 31:19.195
No, but maybe there's more
there that could help us find him.

31:21.566 --> 31:22.832
- Alice?
- Yeah?

31:22.867 --> 31:25.234
- So, I found the forger.
- You did? How?

31:25.269 --> 31:26.535
Well, I figured it
had to be someone local

31:26.571 --> 31:27.837
since it was only a few days

31:27.872 --> 31:29.071
between you showing the
painting to Christopher

and him leaving it for you, so...

31:37.515 --> 31:39.882
and gave up the name of
her client, Julian Marsh.

31:39.917 --> 31:42.351
Obviously it's a pseudonym, but
when I cross-referenced it

31:42.387 --> 31:44.453
with "Christopher Hall," I found these.

31:45.723 --> 31:48.824
"Christopher Ryan Hall dies at 75."

31:48.860 --> 31:51.293
The same week you met your

no surviving family members,

31:56.100 --> 31:57.400
and published in the New York Tribune.

31:57.435 --> 31:59.235
Can you look in the
Trib and see if there's

31:59.270 --> 32:01.203
any other obits that
follow the same pattern?

32:01.239 --> 32:02.371

I'm sorry.

33:18.916 --> 33:20.616

- [Chuckles]
- The police asked us to help find him.

33:27.658 --> 33:30.659
I thought if I searched his room...

33:30.695 --> 33:32.528
Did you find anything?

33:32.563 --> 33:34.230
Not yet.

33:34.265 --> 33:36.298
I should come back
later if you and Rebecca are...

33:36.334 --> 33:38.501
No, uh, stay. Uh, I want to help...

bring some justice to Edith.

- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Hey.

34:05.663 --> 34:09.264
So you can run and tell the
police I killed Edith?

34:09.300 --> 34:11.567
And stole the jewels to
make it look like a robbery.

34:13.304 --> 34:15.337
And used Rebecca to get out of jail.

34:15.373 --> 34:16.605
And used me.

34:16.641 --> 34:18.806
You basically put Payton's
iPad in my hands

34:18.842 --> 34:21.877
so I'd have everything I
need to frame Payton for you.

34:21.913 --> 34:23.379
Even if I did, I can't be tried

34:23.414 --> 34:25.547

That's the beauty of double jeopardy.

entirely different crime.
