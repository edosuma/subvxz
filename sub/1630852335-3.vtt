We create unique challenges that
participants of any levels can

01:28.221 --> 01:29.488
Do from home at any time,

walking, running,

finish line.

We launched virtual run canada
in 2020 when our core business

01:48.708 --> 01:50.042
Came to a complete stop.

01:51.111 --> 01:55.046
Our participants motivate each
other, and we've launched a full

01:55.115 --> 01:57.649
Digital platform for them so
they can share on social media.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.888
We provide them with apparel,

02:02.956 --> 02:05.991
Platform for them to follow
along the way.

02:06.059 --> 02:10.061
So, if it's your very first two
kilometre or you're doing a full

02:10.130 --> 02:12.931
Monthly challenge, our groups

02:13.000 --> 02:14.766

participating alone.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.637
And so how and where would I run
at home?

02:19.372 --> 02:20.672
Anywhere around the block?

02:20.740 --> 02:24.376
[marc] that's the beauty about
virtual events is you create

02:24.444 --> 02:26.978
Your own course and sync with
our platform with multiple

02:26.981 --> 02:29.181

02:35.422 --> 02:36.588
[michele] okay.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.923
[marc] that's our race of the
month,

02:37.991 --> 02:39.691
And basically what it is
is a subscription box.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.361
And we created the<i> dragons' den</i>
5k.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.563

A single race or sign up for a
subscription.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.743

finish line,

02:58.746 --> 03:00.779
They upload results using
a smart device.

03:02.482 --> 03:05.417
So, marc, these are two separate
products, right?

03:05.485 --> 03:06.718
That is correct.

03:06.786 --> 03:09.287
[dianne] their single events
cost around $30,

03:09.356 --> 03:11.356
While their monthly
subscription,

03:11.425 --> 03:13.525
Which includes swag,
goes for $45 a month.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.295
So what was the business before
covid started?

03:17.097 --> 03:18.897
You ran marathons across the
country?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.999
Actually, our core business is
called sportstats, so we provide

03:21.067 --> 03:23.468
Timing and results for sporting
events across country.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.471
Oh, it's the screens where you
see your time?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.273
And the tracker is on your
shoes?

03:28.341 --> 03:29.407
[marc] that's correct, yeah.

03:29.476 --> 03:30.709
[michele] oh, that was you guys.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.210
So, our core business--like, the
toronto waterfront marathon,

03:32.279 --> 03:33.445
Canada running series--

03:33.513 --> 03:34.579
Yeah.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.218
[manjit] oh, that's cool.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.952
[marc] we generate between $5
and $6 million a year

03:41.021 --> 03:42.621
For timing races.

part of all of the business,

-Is it?
-Negative.

them, I found myself invested

17:11.197 --> 17:12.063
[geoff] you just gotta screw
it.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.230
[arlene] very interesting.

17:13.299 --> 17:14.765
-I'm geoff heschel.
-And I'm colette heschel.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.467
And we're from morse,
saskatchewan.

17:17.837 --> 17:21.072
We are asking for $50,000 for
10% of our business,

17:21.140 --> 17:22.240
Gh the leveller.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.977
We own and operate an oil and
gas business and have

17:27.046 --> 17:31.082
For the last 16 years, so in
2008, we built a new home,

17:31.150 --> 17:33.751
And a couple years later, geoff
went to go build a deck and...

17:34.954 --> 17:37.688
[geoff] I knew I wanted to build
some adjustability into my deck,

17:37.756 --> 17:40.691
So I just went back to our shop
and designed and built my own.

17:40.759 --> 17:41.825
[manjit] hmm.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.295
So basically the way the
leveller works, you drill an

17:44.297 --> 17:47.798
Inch-and-a-quarter hole in your
post of your block, and then you

17:47.801 --> 17:52.736
Take the nut portion of the
leveller, and you attach it

17:52.805 --> 17:55.940
Overtop, and then you screw in
the footing of the leveller.

17:57.143 --> 18:02.613
And now, you've got a way to
level your deck as you build it,

18:02.682 --> 18:06.650
But you can re-level it later on
should it or shall I say when it

18:06.653 --> 18:07.819
Shifts or heaves.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.888
-Right.
-And I'm gonna level with you:

18:10.956 --> 18:12.857
[both] life is better when
things are level.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.625
[dragons laugh]

18:15.361 --> 18:17.027
[colette] so we're just gonna
point you to the display--

18:17.096 --> 18:18.395
-[michele] okay.
-[manjit] yeah.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.997
[colette]--where they've
installed the leveller

18:20.065 --> 18:21.432
On a deck.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.533
[geoff] and you've got some
displays beside you as well.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.668
[colette] and you've got some
displays on here, yeah.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.037
It's very strong and robust.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.772
[arlene] it's almost like a
table leveller, the same--you

18:28.841 --> 18:31.042
Take the same notion, but you
just made it for a deck, right?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.143
[colette] yes.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.078
Yeah, or like you'd see on your
fridge or on your

18:34.080 --> 18:35.079
Washing machine.

18:35.147 --> 18:36.313
Yeah.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.982
How much pressure can this
withstand?

18:38.818 --> 18:43.053
Well, we've got it engineered to
meet building codes all over.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.655
-[michele] it looks like a lot.
-That's important.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.324
[geoff] and it'll hold 18,000
pounds.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.694
[arlene] it is kind of ironic
that you're from saskatchewan

18:49.762 --> 18:51.062
And you're trying to level
things out.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.496
-[laughter]
-yeah.

18:52.565 --> 18:56.000
-Yeah, well, you know--
-pretty flat there.

18:56.068 --> 18:58.469
It is if you travel through on
the no. 1.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.572
So what's your experience in
getting things

19:01.574 --> 19:02.840
Into the retail stores?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.843
[geoff] when we started this
project, there was as lumber

19:05.845 --> 19:08.646
Store in moose jaw, actually,
that I had bought quite a bit

19:08.648 --> 19:11.649
Of lumber from, and I said, "you
know, this is an idea that I've

19:11.651 --> 19:14.385
Put on my deck years ago.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.920
Do you think you could sell
it?"

19:15.988 --> 19:18.022
And they said, "we think we
could sell the heck

19:18.090 --> 19:18.923
Out of that thing."

19:19.592 --> 19:20.891
So--

19:20.893 --> 19:22.993
But when they told you they
could sell the heck out of it...

19:22.996 --> 19:24.929
-[geoff] mm hmm.
-...Did they?

19:24.997 --> 19:25.963
-[geoff] they did.
-[michele] did they buy any?

19:26.031 --> 19:28.465
Okay, how much is "the heck out
of it"?

19:28.468 --> 19:29.600
I'm trying to figure it out.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.803
Well, to date, we've sold
$280,000 worth.

19:32.805 --> 19:33.671
Right.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.239
We're in 130 stores across
canada.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.009
So not just in saskatchewan,
but across canada.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.610
-What stores?
-[colette] we're in--

19:39.678 --> 19:42.012
-[geoff] all independents.
-[arlene and manjit] okay.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.747
[colette] yeah, like windsor
plywoods and like--

19:43.750 --> 19:45.049
Home hardwares.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.084
So last 12 months, ballpark,
what do you think your revenue

19:47.152 --> 19:48.352
Was for the last 12 months?

19:49.555 --> 19:50.755
[colette] the last 12 months?

19:50.757 --> 19:53.791
Because it was deck building
season the last 14 months.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.560
Yeah, so, well, the last three
months, we've done $80,000.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.896
-Right.
-So last year, we did $51,000.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.766
And how much is it on shelves?

20:02.835 --> 20:04.835
[geoff] yes, it varies a little
bit...

20:04.903 --> 20:05.870
[manjit] right.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.206
...But approximately about $21
is the retail.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.107
But that's cheap.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.143
Why haven't you sold more than
$51,000 in the last year?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.913
Well, really we're on an uptick
this year,

20:15.981 --> 20:17.481
But I'll let you answer that.

20:18.550 --> 20:22.720
Well, I guess one of the reasons
was like how we've been--we need

20:22.788 --> 20:25.122
Some help probably with
marketing.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.957
-So you need distribution too.
-[geoff] yeah.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.125
And distribution as well, yeah.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.192
We know--

20:29.262 --> 20:30.394
And last year, michele, we would
have sold more,

20:30.463 --> 20:35.599
But what happened was in August
all the retailers ran out

20:35.602 --> 20:39.069
Of lumber, and so if you
couldn't go buy the 4x4s

20:39.072 --> 20:40.404
Or the 6x6s to
build your deck...

20:40.406 --> 20:41.672
-Right, totally get that part.
-[manjit] yeah.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.308
...Well, then we couldn't sell
the leveller, right?

20:44.377 --> 20:45.576
[michele] I hear what you're
saying, like,

20:45.644 --> 20:47.911
It was harder to get in front of
people, but then it was kind

20:47.914 --> 20:48.812
Of about innovating
through that.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.814
[geoff] yeah.

20:50.883 --> 20:51.816
It's like, "let me build you a
video.

20:51.884 --> 20:52.816
Let me send the buyer a video.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.951
Let me keep doing that."

20:53.953 --> 20:54.551
[colette] so, I was just gonna
say that, michele.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.486
So we did, last summer...

20:55.488 --> 20:56.354
[geoff] actually, we did do
that.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.154
...Geoff did a video.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.322

20:58.390 --> 21:00.024

with a skin care line that she

25:17.082 --> 25:20.050
Thinks will soften the dragons'
hands and hearts.

25:22.888 --> 25:23.921
[evelyne] good afternoon,
dragons.

25:23.989 --> 25:25.455
How are you doing?

25:25.458 --> 25:26.790
My name is evelyne nyairo.

25:27.459 --> 25:33.597
I'm here asking for $350,000 for
8% of my brand, ellie bianca.

25:35.767 --> 25:39.036
After travelling all over the
world, providing environmental

25:39.104 --> 25:42.039
Engineering solutions,
I decided to follow my passion

25:43.508 --> 25:46.944
And start a skin care brand to
be able to create meaningful

25:47.012 --> 25:47.845
Impact in the world.

25:49.247 --> 25:53.650
After all, young girls cannot be
the women they don't see.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.352
How we started was with the
mangoes.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.056
I was in central africa in chad
on a pipeline

25:59.124 --> 26:00.290
Construction project.

26:01.526 --> 26:05.128
While purchasing mangoes, I was
asked to the pay the husband

26:05.131 --> 26:07.164
When it was the woman who had
done all the work.

26:08.601 --> 26:10.233
-[dragons chuckle]
-doesn't seem fair.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.269
[evelyne] this happened
everywhere, including right here

26:12.337 --> 26:13.671
In canada in different forms.

26:15.407 --> 26:19.810
I have formulated effective skin
care product that your average

26:19.878 --> 26:23.747
Ingredients like hibiscus, shea,
mangoes that have been used

26:23.815 --> 26:28.619
For centuries to provide ethical
and effective skin care that our

26:28.687 --> 26:30.287
Customers are falling in love
with.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.189
[manjit] hmm.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.825
Can't wait to see and smell
this.

26:37.696 --> 26:42.165
[evelyne] now we have 34 skews
that range from skin oils,

26:42.234 --> 26:44.268
Face oils, bath salts,
face serums.

26:45.771 --> 26:49.606
While each one of our product
has a story, today, I'm only

26:49.675 --> 26:52.876
Going to focus on one product:
On our radiant serum.

26:54.913 --> 26:58.115
We launched the radiant serum to
really tackle a taboo:

26:58.183 --> 26:59.383
Menopause.

27:00.118 --> 27:02.653
It's just part of the aging
process, so we've launched this

27:02.721 --> 27:07.324
Serum to help the woman as she's
going through this stage...

27:07.393 --> 27:08.692
Has a nice feel, the serum.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.993
Nice texture.

27:09.995 --> 27:11.695
[evelyne]..So that, you know,
they can keep that glow and

27:11.763 --> 27:14.264
Really embrace that stage in
life.

27:15.767 --> 27:18.035
[michele] and is there science
that this helps with the

27:18.103 --> 27:22.205
Menopause loss of glow or
whatever it's marketed to?

27:22.208 --> 27:23.640
-[evelyne] so it's--
-oh, you just wait, honey.

27:23.643 --> 27:25.242
I have to see if it works.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.978
[vincenzo] she's saying does it
help?

27:28.046 --> 27:31.482
In terms of science, as I said,
I am a biochemist by training,

27:31.550 --> 27:33.283
So it's really looking at,
you know,

27:33.285 --> 27:34.952
What is happening when we age.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.120
What happens at the skin level?

27:37.489 --> 27:40.157
So, we are looking at bringing
in ingredients that will really

27:40.225 --> 27:41.492
Bring in that moisture.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.328
So tell us about your price
point comparison to your

27:45.331 --> 27:46.963

27:46.966 --> 27:51.035

to $250.00.

top-seller.

27:55.874 --> 27:56.807
[vincenzo] whoa, whoa, I heard
$250.

27:56.875 --> 27:57.808
-The glow serum.
-For what?

27:57.876 --> 27:58.775
[michele] the glow serum is
$250?

27:58.844 --> 27:59.977
-That's correct.
-Holy smokes.

it's a concentrated serum.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.115
-[manjit] this luxe glow?
-The luxe glow, the little one.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.316
[vincenzo] the little one, yeah?

28:06.385 --> 28:07.651
-[arlene] the little one?
-[manjit] this is liquid gold!

28:07.720 --> 28:08.986
Wow.

28:09.054 --> 28:11.655
[wes] evelyne, tell me about
your tie back to africa.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.292
Is there any kind of social
aspect to that?

28:15.861 --> 28:17.127
Tell me about that.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.529
Yes, so when I launched the
brand, you know, living a super

28:19.532 --> 28:23.667
Successful career, the brand is
actually grounded on three

28:23.669 --> 28:26.904
Pillars--kind to your skin, kind
to the earth, and kind to women.

28:28.607 --> 28:31.675
So we have--I work with the
women-run corps in africa.

28:31.677 --> 28:34.244
And right here in canada,
we have a scholarship

28:34.312 --> 28:35.345
For single mothers.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.682
I had my daughter when I was
fairly young with nobody to help

28:38.684 --> 28:41.084
Me, with all my family being
away...

28:41.153 --> 28:42.218
Yeah.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.820
...And I knew that the one thing
that got me through,

28:43.889 --> 28:45.622
That got me to where I am,
was having an education.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.892
I mean, I love the kind to skin,
kind to earth, kind to women.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.761
That's a--I think that's nice.

28:50.829 --> 28:53.397
I think that part there is
fantastic.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.932
Tell us the sales last year,
please.

28:55.834 --> 28:57.901
Last year, we did $600,000.

28:59.171 --> 29:02.206
And we're projecting to do about
$2 million this year.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.609
You're going from $600,000 to
$2 million?

29:05.677 --> 29:06.577
-[evelyne] that's correct.
-[michele] whoa.

29:06.645 --> 29:07.978
[arlene] how are you going to do
that?

29:07.980 --> 29:10.781
How we're doing that is that we
have about a million dollars

29:10.849 --> 29:12.750
Of my own personal money into
the business.

29:13.685 --> 29:14.684
-[manjit] oh my.
-[dragons] a million dollars?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.353
-Wow.
-[evelyne] that's correct.

29:17.055 --> 29:21.391
Evelyne, how did you get to a
$4.25 million valuation?

29:22.194 --> 29:23.861
Like how--how?

29:25.698 --> 29:28.899
It's not the numbers today; it's
the numbers we're able to do

29:28.967 --> 29:30.801
In the next few years.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.371
[michele] and what made you take
the plunge from a stable career

29:34.439 --> 29:36.406
And lots of capital saved up to
do this?

29:38.243 --> 29:39.509
[evelyne] I wanted to make a
difference.

29:39.578 --> 29:43.947
I have a daughter, and I want
her to see me overcoming,

29:44.016 --> 29:48.552
Me succeeding, and so that I can
just really inspire hope.

29:49.521 --> 29:52.355
And I said, "for my daughter's
sake, I am going to build

29:52.358 --> 29:56.159
Something so we can start
igniting this meaningful

29:56.228 --> 29:57.928

a starting point.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.198
I get it and so I understand
that.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.466
And I understand the example
that you're setting

30:03.535 --> 30:04.534
For your daughter.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.036
It's actually powerful.

30:06.104 --> 30:09.272
The thing I can't get over
though is the valuation

30:09.341 --> 30:10.541
At $4.3 million.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.211
So that's the only reason why I
wouldn't invest with you.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.280
The valuation is just too rich.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.448
And as a result of that, I'm
out.

30:20.418 --> 30:23.453

mistakes that happen often

30:23.521 --> 30:24.721

off.

off for the size of return

30:31.697 --> 30:32.863
You've received.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.199
Now let me tell you what I think
you've done right.

30:36.535 --> 30:37.701
You have a good cause.

30:37.769 --> 30:40.103

you're trying to do.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.805
You have a good product.

30:41.874 --> 30:44.541
So what you have to do is focus
on the things you're good at

30:44.610 --> 30:47.244
And learn from the mistakes and
reset yourself.

30:48.613 --> 30:51.315
Because I can tell you this is a
very, very tough space.

30:52.517 --> 30:53.483

sharing your story.

31:13.071 --> 31:16.440

with that.

31:16.508 --> 31:20.143

riding the crest of a wave

35:30.628 --> 35:32.062
In the water sport industry.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.731
Hi dragons.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.933
-I'm jerry mcarthur.
-And I'm wendy mcarthur.

35:37.001 --> 35:39.769
And we are here asking for $1
million for 10% of our business.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.640
[jerry] ever since I was a young
kid, I was infatuated with

35:43.708 --> 35:45.875
Action sports, like
snowmobiling, dirt biking,

35:45.944 --> 35:46.977
And surfing.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.812
Then a couple years ago,
something new caught my

35:49.881 --> 35:52.582
Attention--foiling--and I became
obsessed with the idea of flying

35:52.651 --> 35:53.450
Above the waves.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.019
-[chuckles]
-but there was a problem.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.921
It was both dangerous and really
hard to learn.

35:59.724 --> 36:03.226
Introducing the hydroflyer--the
world's most advanced personal

36:03.294 --> 36:04.594
Watercraft ever created.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.030
-[arlene] wow.
-Whoa.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.065
-That looks very cool.
-[manjit] oh my goodness.

36:09.133 --> 36:12.101
[wendy] the hydroflyer is a
combination of jet ski,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.837
Motorized surf board, and efoil,
with speeds up to 50 kilometres

36:14.906 --> 36:16.573
An hour.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.608
-That's fast.
-[jerry] we'll show the video?

36:21.046 --> 36:22.445
The perfect blend of usability
and excitement.

36:23.482 --> 36:27.617
While jet skis create wakes,
drink gas, and make noise,

36:27.685 --> 36:30.019
The hydroflyer uses a lithium
battery and a brushless motor

36:30.022 --> 36:31.555
To fly silently above the waves.

36:32.758 --> 36:36.025
It's a better, safer, and just
more fun way to enjoy the latest

36:36.028 --> 36:37.594
Craze: Efoiling.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.495
-[michele] yeah.
-[manjit] wow.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.064
That looks scary and fun at the
same time.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.567
And it's so cool that it's
quiet.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.302
Because most things, it's really
loud.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.937
I think it's very cool.

36:48.306 --> 36:50.873
When I'm learning on this,
how often am I falling

36:50.942 --> 36:52.108
When I'm learning?

36:52.177 --> 36:54.911
[wendy] well, the learning curve
we found was about 15 minutes.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.915
And on a regular foil, nine out
of ten people cannot use it.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.551
What's a regular foil, sorry?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.686
So a regular foil is without the
handlebars.

37:03.755 --> 37:04.954
Okay.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.423
[wendy] once you get to the
level you want to take them off,

37:07.426 --> 37:08.725
You can.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.227
So you could ride it like a
normal surfboard as well,

37:11.296 --> 37:13.830
But nobody has one with the
handlebars like this with four

37:13.832 --> 37:15.098
Points of contact.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.568
-What does this sell for?
-$15,000.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.136
-[arlene] $15,000.
-Oh, oh!

37:20.204 --> 37:21.871
The total cost of making one of
these?

37:22.808 --> 37:24.207
It's about 30%.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.775
There's a 300% markup.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.644
We're doing our first run of
100...

37:27.712 --> 37:28.578
Right.

37:28.646 --> 37:30.647
...And so far,
we have tentatively sold

37:30.715 --> 37:31.881
All of those ones.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.417
[wes] so, guys, why is this
worth $10 million,

37:34.485 --> 37:35.752
This whole company?

37:35.820 --> 37:37.487
[wendy] well, the personal
watercraft market is estimated

37:37.555 --> 37:38.788
$2.4 billion.

37:39.625 --> 37:43.860
And $150 million of that is just
efoils, and it's growing at 100%

37:43.862 --> 37:45.161
Year on year.

37:46.231 --> 37:48.431
[jerry] yeah, and I think we
have something that appeals

37:48.499 --> 37:50.633
To a much broader audience.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.203
-You haven't sold any yet.
-Everybody starts somewhere.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.406
Not at a $10 million valuation.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.808
We've already pre-sold several
hundred of these.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.278
