12:05.759 --> 12:09.262
Well, if it's your third year,
then you should know the rules.

12:09.296 --> 12:10.798
I got to write you a yellow slip

12:10.831 --> 12:13.200
for being out of dress code
with those shoes.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.936
Yeah, but they're Air Jordans.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.704
Like Michael Jordan wears.

12:17.737 --> 12:22.542
Yeah, but Michael Jordan doesn't
have to abide by our dress code.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.312
See, look, you want to be
in a place like this,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.480
you got to look the part, okay.

12:27.514 --> 12:31.952
That's why I rock a suit.
You know, like Arsenio Hall.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.623
Sorry, man.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.804
There he is.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.306
- And this is Jack.
- Oh, my God.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.851
- He's just six months old.
- Oh, God, those eyelashes.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.976
Right?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.777
That's pretty amazing.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.147
We named him after his grandpa.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.152
Oh, and here she is.
This is my wife Kate.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.687
-Kate, please meet Debbie
and Arjun.
-Hi, how are you?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.656
Toby was just showing us
photos of your son.

13:09.689 --> 13:10.991
He's ridiculously cute.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.826
Oh, thank you.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.328
Yeah, thankfully,
'cause there's no return policy.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.197
No, there's not.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.532
But we are not here
to talk about him.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.844
We are here to talk about
database servers

13:20.868 --> 13:22.970
and all of your other
IT needs. So...

13:23.003 --> 13:24.271
Your table is ready, folks.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.507
-Come with me.
-Great.
-Thank you.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.476
You look great.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.744
Thanks. So do you.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.382
Oh, actually,
you know what. Sorry.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.826
I hate to be a pain,
but it looks like

13:36.850 --> 13:38.518
we're right below a vent here,

13:38.551 --> 13:41.721
and a cool breeze can really
ruin a hot lobster bisque.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.157
They have an amazing
lobster bisque.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.835
Uh, do you think we could
sit at a different table,

13:45.859 --> 13:46.960
like that one over there?

13:46.994 --> 13:48.528
Sorry, sir, those are reserved.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.830
This is fine.
We don't eat bisque.

13:50.864 --> 13:54.201
I was gonna have bisque.
I love bisque...

13:54.234 --> 13:58.838
He's actually asking because
I... can't fit in the booth.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.342
I should come with
a label, right?

14:02.375 --> 14:05.178
"May contain uncomfortable
moments."

14:06.346 --> 14:09.349
I'm so sorry.
There's a table this way.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.284
Thank you.
Love you.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.095

14:22.129 --> 14:24.932
Pearson, yeah.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.907
I don't know how I missed that

14:33.941 --> 14:36.176
we didn't have
the water line inspection.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.712
Do you know how much
your mistake is gonna cost?

14:39.746 --> 14:43.083
20,000. That's money
straight out of my pocket.

14:43.116 --> 14:46.753

know how this happened.

how the bus system is jacked.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.047
why don't you come

20:17.083 --> 20:19.619
Jae-won, please extend
my apologies

20:19.652 --> 20:21.053

20:21.087 --> 20:23.923

21:51.043 --> 21:52.144

to make you feel bad

a heart attack at age 38.

22:07.259 --> 22:10.663

22:10.697 --> 22:13.332

challenging enough,

22:13.366 --> 22:15.544

22:18.571 --> 22:20.640

22:20.673 --> 22:23.075
I didn't say that.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.748
- Kate...
- I get it.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.418
This just caught me
a little off guard.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.393
♪

22:51.804 --> 22:53.205
Jack?

22:53.239 --> 22:54.441
Jack, what happened?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.210
He fired me.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.914
Yeah, I'm done.

23:05.418 --> 23:08.020
Miguel... Hey. Hey.
Where you going?

23:08.054 --> 23:09.556
Miguel?

23:09.589 --> 23:10.790
Rivas, not now...

23:10.823 --> 23:13.960
Jack has been with this company
for almost 20 years.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.394
He's a hard worker.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.129
Has a great relationship
with our crews,

23:17.163 --> 23:19.466
and he brings the best chili
to the company cookouts.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.769
-So if he goes, I go.
-Miguel, look, you don't
have to...

23:22.802 --> 23:26.573
I am your most successful
upper-level account manager.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.107
Five of the eight
most lucrative deals

23:28.140 --> 23:30.977
we made last year,
I brought those clients in.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.913
So I want you to ask yourself,
Pritchard, what's worth more:

23:33.946 --> 23:35.882
the $20,000 that
we're gonna lose today,

23:35.915 --> 23:38.150
or the hundreds of thousands
that you will lose

23:38.184 --> 23:40.953
when me, Jack,
and all my cash-rich clients

23:40.987 --> 23:42.822
walk out of here.
'Cause I will do it.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.758
I will walk out of here today,
and I will not look back.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.304
Whew!
That was so fun, right, Bug?

23:58.337 --> 23:59.982
I would love to do
another one of these tapes

24:00.006 --> 24:02.174
- with you sometime.
- Yeah, that would be awesome.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.852
I'm gonna go get some water.
Do you want some?

24:03.876 --> 24:06.045
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.502
What part of "tell your husband

24:29.536 --> 24:32.371
not to block the sidewalk"
didn't you understand?

24:32.404 --> 24:35.608
Really? Not now. Okay, dude?

24:35.642 --> 24:37.143
I just found out my husband

24:37.176 --> 24:38.845
has been sneaking off
to get ripped,

24:38.878 --> 24:42.281
while I'm just here at home
taking care of our son.

24:42.314 --> 24:46.485
So really, I'm not in the mood
for your stupid curb drama.

24:48.387 --> 24:50.857
I'm sorry you're having
a bad day.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.894
I had a massive stroke
two and a half years ago.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.963
Almost punched my ticket.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.798
I had to relearn
how to do everything.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.368
How to walk, talk,
even how to chew and swallow.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.704
I finally did it, though.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.139
And a week later, I lost my job.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.009
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's awful...

25:10.042 --> 25:11.177
Not done yet.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.580
My only goal right now
is to be able to walk

25:13.613 --> 25:15.414
just one pathetic mile.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.884
So every morning,
I walk around this block.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.219
I'm not fast, but I do it.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.664
Unless your husband
blocks the sidewalk,

25:21.688 --> 25:22.822
and I can't get past.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.157
If he does again tomorrow,
I'm keying his car.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.927
This hand still works fine.

25:30.597 --> 25:33.199
This is me storming away!

25:33.232 --> 25:36.335
Don't blink, you'll miss it.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.437
All right, little mamas...

25:38.470 --> 25:40.840
chicken parm is in the oven,

25:40.873 --> 25:44.110
we have 30 minutes on the timer,

25:44.143 --> 25:45.712
catch me up on your days.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.079
I want to know everything.

25:47.113 --> 25:50.783
- My math teacher
looks like Zendaya.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.284
Wait, cute Spider-Man Zendaya

25:52.318 --> 25:55.655
- or HBO drugged-out Zendaya?
- Wait, I'll be right back.

25:58.257 --> 26:00.593
What about you, huh?

26:00.627 --> 26:02.695
How was your day?

26:02.729 --> 26:05.932
You make any friends
you want to tell me about?

26:05.965 --> 26:09.201
Not really.
It was pretty average.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.271
People, classes, you know.

26:14.974 --> 26:17.243
Hey.

26:17.276 --> 26:18.778
You got my text?

26:18.811 --> 26:21.213
Yeah, I'm pretty
good at using the phone.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.417
Listen, um...

26:26.452 --> 26:29.121
You hear anything
about me in school?

26:29.155 --> 26:32.258
No. Like what?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.961
I mean, you running
for student council

26:34.994 --> 26:36.996
or something lame like that?

26:38.197 --> 26:40.933
No, no. Not quite.
Um...

26:43.369 --> 26:47.006
Thing is,
I-I, I have a daughter.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.475
She's six months old.

26:49.508 --> 26:52.011
I knew you might
hear about it at school,

26:52.044 --> 26:55.614
and I didn't want to tell you
over text.

26:55.648 --> 27:00.820
Her-her, her mom and I were
together for a while, and...

27:00.853 --> 27:03.355
well, she got pregnant.

27:03.389 --> 27:06.959
See, her-her parents
wanted to put Janelle...

27:06.993 --> 27:10.529
That's my girl, Janelle, um...

27:10.562 --> 27:12.031
wanted to put her up
for adoption,

27:12.064 --> 27:13.800
but me, me and my parents
didn't want that,

27:13.833 --> 27:16.969
so... so we got her.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.716
- ♪ Oh, yeah ♪
- Hey, I did the session.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.483
You want to go to jail?

27:31.517 --> 27:32.852
Is that what you want?

27:32.885 --> 27:33.962
Because that's what
your future holds

27:33.986 --> 27:35.230
if you don't start
taking this seriously.

27:35.254 --> 27:36.823
Yeah, well, at least
if I go to jail,

27:36.856 --> 27:39.658
you won't keep coming around
to bust my balls.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.460
Hey! What?!

27:41.493 --> 27:43.462
Did you know that I was sober
for over a year?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.698
And then I came here
and I met you,

27:45.732 --> 27:47.734
and then, guess what,
I started drinking again.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.311
- Did you know that?
- I didn't ask you to come back.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.502
Well, I did.

27:50.536 --> 27:53.139
I'm your brother's son,
all right?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.875
And I have come here
twice now for you.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.421
And if you're not gonna show me
a little bit of gratitude,

27:59.445 --> 28:01.881
perhaps you can search deep down
inside somewhere,

28:01.914 --> 28:04.250
and find, like, an ounce
of understanding.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.188
Damn, I need a meeting.
You know, this...

28:11.057 --> 28:13.001
I'm going to a meeting,
and you're coming with me, okay?

28:13.025 --> 28:15.494
And I don't give a damn
if you wait in the car or not,

28:15.527 --> 28:17.405
but I'm not leaving you here,
and I need a meeting,

28:17.429 --> 28:18.464
so let's go.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.268
Get up. Let's go.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.007
Hey. You okay?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.842
What'd you do?

28:29.876 --> 28:31.410
I was out of dress code.

28:31.443 --> 28:34.213
That's what
you're freaking out about?

28:34.246 --> 28:36.215
What, was your shirt
not tucked deep enough

28:36.248 --> 28:37.616
into your old man pants?

28:37.649 --> 28:39.118
This is not funny!

28:40.619 --> 28:43.122
Come on.
Let me see your slip.

28:45.758 --> 28:49.395
You want Mom in a hurry
or Mom before bed?

28:49.428 --> 28:51.563
Never mind.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.599
- Wait, you can't do that!
- It's fine.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.101
I do this all the time.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.770
This way Mom and Dad
will never know

28:57.804 --> 28:59.772
you got in trouble.

28:59.806 --> 29:03.475
Come on, man, just calm down.

29:03.509 --> 29:06.112
It's gonna be okay.
Calm down.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.391
I don't know how they let
the quarterback

29:09.415 --> 29:11.417
who won them the Super Bowl
become a free agent.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.453
You sure the Eagles roster
is outside your purview?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.322
Mr. Morris, I'm gonna
take your experiences

29:16.355 --> 29:18.257
to the Transportation Committee.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.893
-I really
appreciate it, Councilman.
-I appreciate you, sir.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.995
- Take care.
- 6:52.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.630
Oh, my goodness,
I know, Bernice.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.632
I'm headed over there now.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.300
Uh, excuse me.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.903
Sir, that door's
off the hinges on purpose.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.105
I just got a call
about putting it back.

29:33.139 --> 29:36.876
Having the door off
is a fire hazard.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.413
Uh, excuse me, everyone,

29:41.447 --> 29:43.349
could you, could you
give us the room?

29:45.184 --> 29:46.285
Please.

29:54.961 --> 29:58.030
I think I've been pretty patient
with all the eye rolls

29:58.064 --> 30:00.432
and the sighs and the attitude.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.302
To be clear...

30:03.335 --> 30:07.373
I am the councilman here.
Not you.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.441
Then you need to start
acting like it.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.343
Excuse me?

30:11.377 --> 30:14.680
You're a politician,
not a therapist.

30:14.713 --> 30:17.616
You're new, naive, and you have
no track record here.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.953
You need to spend your time
trying to get the 16 people

30:20.987 --> 30:23.055
you govern with on your side.

30:23.089 --> 30:26.458
Not gabbing with
every Joe Schmoe off the street.

30:26.492 --> 30:30.229
But I shouldn't be
telling you this.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.698
Your chief of staff should.

30:32.731 --> 30:34.633
And what are you saying?

30:34.666 --> 30:39.471
You really want to serve
these people, hmm?

30:39.505 --> 30:42.841
You need someone who understands
how city council works.

30:42.875 --> 30:44.810
And who's not
pulling double duty

30:44.843 --> 30:47.914
as your best friend.
So what am I saying?

30:47.947 --> 30:52.584
Let me be clear:
You need to fire Jae-won.

31:02.294 --> 31:05.164
Our son soils
an incredible amount

31:05.197 --> 31:08.367
- of clothing for
a 14-pound being.
- Yeah.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.037
His main passion in life
is making things

31:11.070 --> 31:14.273
inside his body suddenly appear
outside of his body, so...

31:14.306 --> 31:15.774
Yeah.

31:17.576 --> 31:20.246
Hey, look, I'm, uh...

31:20.279 --> 31:22.448
I'm sorry I kept all that
CrossFit stuff from you.

31:22.481 --> 31:23.558
I shouldn't have done that.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.618
It's just hard.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.388
You know, seeing you
lose so much weight,

31:29.421 --> 31:31.023
and I'm doing the opposite.

31:31.057 --> 31:33.692
And it took me by surprise.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.462
Seeing you in all those
new clothes today,

31:36.495 --> 31:39.698
it really shook me.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.301
But that's my problem.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.936
I'm so happy that
you're getting healthy,

31:43.970 --> 31:47.406
and you look amazing.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.441
Seriously, you look like
Vin Diesel's body double.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.278
You know that The Pacifier's
my guilty pleasure.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.980
Yes. All too well.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.717
So no more secrets, okay?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.953
No more secrets.

32:02.821 --> 32:06.092
I'm glad you decided to come.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.427
I'm just here for the snacks.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.862
- Drinking gives me a salt tooth.
- Got it.

32:17.503 --> 32:19.338
I mean, of all the AA meetings

32:19.371 --> 32:21.640
in all the towns
in all the world.

32:21.673 --> 32:26.145
-You gonna really
sit next to me?
-No, I'm sitting over there.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.759
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.628
Can I sit?

32:51.803 --> 32:56.375
The boy I like has a baby.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.810
Damn.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.646
I know.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.882
Do you still like him?

33:03.915 --> 33:06.052
It's... I don't know.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.720
It's complicated.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.460
You know, you seemed
pretty complicated, too,

33:14.493 --> 33:15.961
when you showed up.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.668
Okay.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.903
Now it's your turn.

33:30.109 --> 33:33.345
I thought the one good thing
about a new school

33:33.379 --> 33:36.548
would be that
I didn't have to come out.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.885
I could just be out.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.254
But a girl I was
sitting with at lunch

33:42.288 --> 33:45.524
asked me if I thought
this football player was hot

33:45.557 --> 33:47.393
and I said yes.

33:49.261 --> 33:52.764
I don't know why.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.534
And it sucks, like,

33:55.567 --> 34:00.506
I used to want to talk
to my mom about stuff,

34:00.539 --> 34:04.410
- but it's harder now.
- Yeah.

34:04.443 --> 34:08.580
Well, sometimes,

34:08.614 --> 34:12.217
even when you
don't say anything,

34:12.251 --> 34:14.520
they're still there, you know?

34:14.553 --> 34:17.723
I mean, even when they
don't know what's going on,

34:17.755 --> 34:21.127
Randall and Beth are just there.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.563
That's one thing that's
really cool about this house.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.739
- Man, a baby!
- Oh, God.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.442
- Please.
- Oh, stepmom?

34:42.481 --> 34:43.681
Hey.

34:45.351 --> 34:46.752
Hey.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.154
So you good?

34:48.187 --> 34:51.989
You were really
freaking out today.

34:55.793 --> 34:58.730
Randall, for real.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.600
Um...

35:01.633 --> 35:04.436
It felt like my heart
was gonna explode.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.507
Do you think it was, like,
a heart attack?

35:08.540 --> 35:10.642
Kevin told me.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.811
Maybe it was just,
like, puberty.

35:12.844 --> 35:16.415
They say your body does
a bunch of weird stuff.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.151
Thanks for coming today.

35:19.185 --> 35:22.921
Whatever. I was bored.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.624
I kissed Stewart Alberghini
at the pool.

35:25.657 --> 35:30.229
Stewart Alberghini?

35:34.233 --> 35:37.536
Would you ever like a girl
who's bigger than you?

35:37.569 --> 35:40.005
I'm gonna marry Cindy Crawford.

35:40.038 --> 35:42.374
She's, like, 5'9"
and way bigger than me.

35:44.876 --> 35:47.012
Hey, do you know
who Arsenio Hall is?

35:47.045 --> 35:48.714
Randall, you really need

35:48.747 --> 35:51.183
to stop spending
all your time reading.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.822
So...

35:56.855 --> 35:58.957
Stewart Alberghini.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.392
Okay, guys, thank you.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.370
This is Miguel.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.705
Hey, man, you busy?

36:13.739 --> 36:15.407
Uh, no, I'm-I... Well, yeah,

36:15.441 --> 36:17.909
I'm-I'm just going through
a-a mountain of paperwork here.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.346
You doing okay?

36:20.379 --> 36:22.848
Yeah, I'm still employed, so...

36:22.881 --> 36:26.418
Hey, look,

36:26.452 --> 36:28.554
I know we don't ever say

36:28.587 --> 36:31.189
any mushy things
to each other, but

36:31.223 --> 36:32.591
I mean, if we did,

36:32.624 --> 36:34.593
th-this would definitely
be one of those times.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.896
Jack, are you... are you trying
to tell me that you love me?

36:37.929 --> 36:39.274
Is that what you're
trying to do here?

36:39.298 --> 36:40.408
Because I got to tell you, man,

36:40.432 --> 36:42.234
- I'm a married man, so...
- No.

36:43.935 --> 36:47.939
No, what I'm trying
to tell you is

36:47.973 --> 36:50.942
if you ever need anything,
big or small,

36:50.976 --> 36:54.380
and I, and I hear that you went
to anyone other than me,

36:54.413 --> 36:56.515
I'm gonna kick your sorry ass.

36:56.548 --> 37:00.886
Well, I love you, too, snookums,
and I appreciate that.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.021
You know what,
I'm-I'm hanging up now.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.023
No, wait, Jack, Jack.

37:05.056 --> 37:08.460
Any time, man.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.269
Hey, Kev, what are you doing?
You should be in bed.

37:17.303 --> 37:20.138
There's something
we all need to do right now.

37:20.171 --> 37:22.374
I think it's important.

37:24.175 --> 37:27.045
I'm off to a good start, huh?

37:27.078 --> 37:30.148
What are you guys doing?

37:30.181 --> 37:31.983
I thought we could all watch

37:32.017 --> 37:35.954
The Arsenio Hall Show together.

37:39.124 --> 37:42.461
Just tonight.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.696
Come on.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.234
Hey. Did I miss
Wilkins and Ramirez?

37:49.267 --> 37:52.471
Yeah, no, they left,
like, ten minutes ago.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.612
How'd it go at the office?

38:00.646 --> 38:02.514
Oh...

38:04.516 --> 38:06.051
J?

38:09.621 --> 38:11.357
Now I'm gonna go tell
that handyman

38:11.390 --> 38:14.693
to put the door
back on the hinges.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.663
You have a lot of experience
that I don't.

38:17.696 --> 38:21.967
I know the value of what
you bring to the table,

38:22.000 --> 38:26.472
but I can't have someone on my
staff who openly disrespects me,

38:26.505 --> 38:29.007
my policies, and my friend.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.811
You mean your chief of staff.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.946
I'm sorry, Bernice,

38:34.980 --> 38:37.816
today will be your last day.

38:41.353 --> 38:45.857
Okay. I'll start getting
résumés tomorrow.

38:45.891 --> 38:49.828
She called us naive. She right?

38:49.861 --> 38:53.532
Yes. We are naive.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.333
We're unhinged, right?

38:55.367 --> 38:57.636
That's what Bernice and
all those old-school guys think.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.972
If, at the end of your term,
you've maybe made

39:01.006 --> 39:02.841
a couple good changes,

39:02.874 --> 39:04.686
and you spent most of your time
just playing power games

39:04.710 --> 39:06.712
in city hall,
is that what you want?

39:06.745 --> 39:10.649
We're not career
politicians, Randall.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.685
And this isn't some stepping
stone to some bigger gig for us.

39:13.719 --> 39:16.287
This is the gig.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.225
We're gonna have to get
a doorstop tomorrow.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.761
Apparently having it off
its hinges is a fire hazard.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.196
Oh, well, in that case,
we're done for.

39:25.230 --> 39:28.700
Hey,

39:28.734 --> 39:31.937
- let's talk about your proposal.
- Yeah?

39:31.970 --> 39:34.339
Okay.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.843
So, um, Hannah comes in,

39:37.876 --> 39:39.578
and I'm gonna have
the candles lit,

39:39.611 --> 39:41.046
a martini in hand,

39:41.079 --> 39:43.682
and "Everlong"
by the Foo Fighters playing.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.417
The Foo Fighters, really?

39:45.451 --> 39:47.218
Dude, the acoustic version?

39:47.252 --> 39:50.355
Come... That is, like, the most
romantic song on the planet.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.123

Honestly, I've been struggling
quite a bit today.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.709
I've been wanting
to drink pretty badly.

40:10.742 --> 40:14.613
So, uh, I've been using this
technique that I learned.

40:14.646 --> 40:17.583
They say you picture your...
Your reasons not to drink

40:17.616 --> 40:21.152
and then you, um, you just
sort of use them as a mantra.

40:21.186 --> 40:24.155
Like, for me, I-I picture, um,

40:24.189 --> 40:27.759
I picture my nephew's room.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.962
I picture, uh,
his-his robot poster,

40:30.996 --> 40:33.431
panda lamp.

40:33.465 --> 40:38.103
He's got this, um, this
handmade mini football stadium,

40:38.136 --> 40:41.940
complete with a tiny
Terry Bradshaw.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.445
I wasn't sober
when my nephew was born,

40:47.479 --> 40:50.949
but I have been sober
every day since.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.696
I just thought, at this point,

41:04.730 --> 41:07.699
my life would have
a little more purpose.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.268
I just broke up with this
really wonderful woman.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.371
I just turned down this

41:13.404 --> 41:16.474
really wonderful movie.

41:16.508 --> 41:19.177
Was that a mistake?

41:19.210 --> 41:21.513
I don't know.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.715
I'm not getting any younger,
that's for sure.

41:23.749 --> 41:26.384
You know, hopefully, with age,

41:26.417 --> 41:29.888
just comes a little more, uh,
gravitas, right?

41:29.921 --> 41:32.390
But it's not up to us.

41:32.423 --> 41:34.960
I mean, it could be, you know...

41:34.993 --> 41:37.495
"Welcome to Jowl City" at 50,
right? And then what?

41:37.529 --> 41:41.032
I'm-I'm the guy in the AARP ads

41:59.017 --> 42:00.886
Excuse me,

42:00.919 --> 42:03.121
