WEBVTT

02:08.836 --> 02:10.923
Missus, I thought we had an agreement.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.343
Seems like you don't get
how serious this business is,

02:14.426 --> 02:16.261
although I'd think a dead crow
in the mailbox

02:16.345 --> 02:18.263
would be pretty hard to misunderstand.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.850
I'll be seeing you.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.980
Fuck you, Jimmy.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.442
Now, Missus, that isn't a bit nice.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.751
Isn't this just the cutest song?

04:14.046 --> 04:15.380
Look at this.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.512
See what it says on the side there?
Captain Black and Empty Devils.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.517
Captain Black had a magic yo-yo.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.728
Course, you know that.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.067
Yo-yos like this one were
a promotion thing the publisher did.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.946
I got it on eBay and I learned a few
tricks on it too, just like Captain Black.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.578
Watch. I'll make it sleep.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.917
And now I'll walk the dog.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.968
I'm thirsty.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.431
We can fix that.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.169
Feelin' better?

05:36.879 --> 05:38.297
I'll feel better when you're gone.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.466
Fair enough.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.846
I won't take up too much of your time.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.390
We can't afford to linger
in any case, Missus.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.477
Wish I could stay, though.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.107
It's a nice place.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.656
Not that I begrudge him.
He was a flat genius.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.284
He made all the money
with his special talent.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.206
His God-given gift,
and you did nothing but warm his bed.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.876
Makes you sort of a parasite, doesn't it?

06:17.669 --> 06:20.756
Mr. Dooley, we-- we were partners.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.092
We relied on each other.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.845
And we loved each other.

06:27.513 --> 06:31.141
And that's something that
Dashmiel doesn't seem to get.

06:39.483 --> 06:43.320
Well, you know what they say. Opinions
are like assholes. Everyone's got one.

06:46.949 --> 06:50.160
Scott's talent wasn't just special,
it was extra special.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.167
I read every single one of his books.
Maybe the prof told you that.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.836
You know which one I liked the best?

06:59.503 --> 07:03.590
The one with the yo-yo. Empty Devils.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.009
No, Missus.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.515
That's a good one, but it's not so good
as Coaster's Daughter.

07:14.685 --> 07:18.897
I didn't just like it. I loved it and...
I read it to pieces.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.902
My favorite part is when Gene
tells his son of a bitch father

07:23.986 --> 07:25.362
he's never comin' back.

07:30.075 --> 07:33.662
You know what he says, you--
you remember that?

07:36.290 --> 07:42.462
Gene-- Gene says his father
never understood the duty of love.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.589
That's it.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.050
That's just it.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.472
He never understood the duty of love.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.520
How many people have felt something
like that and never had the words?

08:01.899 --> 08:03.859
Scott deserved a place like this.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.529
And now he's gone.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.578
What a shame,
and what a shame you're holding on to

08:14.661 --> 08:16.079
what the world would like to see.

08:29.301 --> 08:32.471
"The women looked at each other in
the way some women do but men never do,

08:32.554 --> 08:35.015
because they see further
and in more colors."

08:37.851 --> 08:40.020
"In more colors."

08:40.102 --> 08:42.940
Only Scott Landon could put it that way
and no one's ever seen it.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.944
It's just sittin' down there in a dark box
because of you.

08:52.824 --> 08:56.787
You know what this woman sees
in front of her right now?

08:59.122 --> 09:00.374
A thief.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.894
Now, you made me do that, Missus.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.065
Now listen to me. You listening to me?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.070
The world deserves to see these.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.324
And we had an agreement
and you didn't stick to it.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.784
What do you mean?

10:17.868 --> 10:19.745
You give me the papers,
I give them to the prof,

10:19.828 --> 10:21.330
he publishes them for the world to see

10:21.413 --> 10:23.999
so people can understand
how great Scott Landon was.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.460
Mr.-- Mr. Dooley.
We-- We-- We didn't have an agreement.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.920
-Yes.
-We didn't-- We didn't have an--

10:28.003 --> 10:30.380
Yes, we surely did.
But you lied, didn't you?

10:31.423 --> 10:32.883
So where's the other stuff?

10:35.010 --> 10:36.762
Where's the secret stuff?

10:37.679 --> 10:40.682
-How you're holdin' it back from the prof.
-No.

10:41.725 --> 10:43.852
-From the world.
-Please.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.812
From me.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.649
Please. Please. Please.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.026
I can't get over it
and it makes me so mad.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.694
I promise you. I promise you.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.365
-You can have all of it.
-Hush.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.368
Hush now, Missus.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.163
No more of your bitchery.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.835
Now, I'm sorry to use such a word, but
I believe in calling a thing by its name.

11:24.476 --> 11:27.646
"Secrets, secrets are no fun.
Secrets, secrets hurt someone."

11:36.572 --> 11:39.032
I've got something we should listen to.
It's from Battle Flags.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.976
There's a sequel to Relics.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.065
No, that was nothin' but one chapter,
and an outline.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.525
I got it right back there, Missus.

14:21.737 --> 14:24.323
You're a liar,
and liars get took to the woodshed.

14:26.867 --> 14:29.161
Now, I better hear from the prof
by 10:00 tomorrow night.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.706
He has no way--
He has no way to reach you.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.208
He can't reach you.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.960
He has no way to reach you.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.465
He doesn't have your number.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.301
-He doesn't have your email. He can't--
-By 10:00 tomorrow night,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.762
or next time the hurting's
gonna be a lot worse.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.266
He has no way to reach you.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.727
No.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.522
No.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.911
Hush now, Missus.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.309
Lisey. No.

15:39.481 --> 15:42.442
Oh, no. No.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.363
Oh.

18:21.935 --> 18:22.978
Lisey.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.653
Oh, God.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.523
All Landons are fast healers.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.775
We had to be.

20:36.445 --> 20:39.781
I'm only a Landon by marriage.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.329
No.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.796
-I shouldn't have told you.
-No.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.050
Daddy said we don't unbury the dead.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.134
No.

20:59.218 --> 21:02.304
No, you have to tell me.
You have to tell me.

21:02.387 --> 21:06.475
You have to finish, and then I promise you
we'll never talk about it ever again.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.354
I loved him, Lisey.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.813
I know you did.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.611
What's going on? What's going on?

21:17.694 --> 21:19.446
It's all right.

21:27.996 --> 21:29.498
You're a natural.

21:29.581 --> 21:30.916
What is this?

21:33.126 --> 21:34.127
Where are we?

21:34.795 --> 21:36.296
Sweetheart Hill.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.633
We have to be quiet.

21:42.719 --> 21:43.804
That's enough.

21:48.225 --> 21:49.226
Lisey.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.590
Hi, Dan.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.133
Well, hello, Mrs. Landon.

23:04.468 --> 23:06.428
Are you okay? Sound a little funny.

23:08.138 --> 23:12.351
I'm okay. I'm-- I'm sleepy. Just sleepy.

23:12.434 --> 23:16.480
I'm-- I'm getting ready to go to bed.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.065
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.191
I just wanted to let you know

23:19.274 --> 23:22.277
that Roddy Boynton's parked on
the side of the road if you need anything.

23:23.070 --> 23:25.405
-Thanks a lot.
-Have a good evening, Mrs. Landon.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.740
Okay, bye.

25:39.581 --> 25:42.042
Please tell me you really
didn't believe any of that crap,

25:42.125 --> 25:43.836
even for a second.

25:43.919 --> 25:45.838
I mean, you were always the practical one.

25:49.424 --> 25:53.637
And the pool didn't just heal.
It had the power to fascinate.

26:46.773 --> 26:50.027
What am I supposed to do
about Dooley, Scott?

26:50.652 --> 26:51.737
And Amanda?

26:53.113 --> 26:54.740
Do you have any ideas?

26:55.949 --> 26:57.451
Babyluv.

26:59.036 --> 27:00.037
Scott?

27:03.540 --> 27:04.750
Scott?

27:10.506 --> 27:11.715
Scott.

27:15.719 --> 27:21.016
I... I loved you. I saved you.

27:21.683 --> 27:22.684
I gave you ice.

27:48.418 --> 27:51.129
My mama told me

27:51.213 --> 27:55.509
She said, son, please beware

27:56.468 --> 27:59.346
There's this thing called love

27:59.429 --> 28:03.517
You know it's everywhere

28:03.600 --> 28:04.935
She told me

28:05.018 --> 28:08.355
-She can break your heart
-Break your heart

28:08.438 --> 28:12.609
-And put you in misery
-And put you in misery

28:13.318 --> 28:17.281
Since I met this little woman, yeah

28:17.364 --> 28:21.451
I feel it happened to me
And I'm telling you

28:21.535 --> 28:25.497
-It's too late to turn back now
-It's too late to turn back now

28:25.581 --> 28:29.835
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

28:30.419 --> 28:36.967
I found myself calling her
At least ten times a day

28:37.509 --> 28:41.221
You know, it's so unusual

28:41.305 --> 28:45.475
For me to carry on this way

28:45.559 --> 28:47.436
I'll tell you, I can't sleep at night

28:47.519 --> 28:49.771
No. No, no, no.

28:50.355 --> 28:54.943
-Wanting to hold her tight
-Wanting to hold her tight

28:55.027 --> 28:57.821
I've tried so hard to convince myself

28:57.905 --> 29:02.409
That this feeling just ain't right

29:02.492 --> 29:06.872
-Yeah, oh, yeah
-It's too late to turn back now

29:06.955 --> 29:10.250
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

29:12.085 --> 29:14.546
I wouldn't mind it

29:14.630 --> 29:18.008
If I knew she really loved me too

29:19.051 --> 29:23.055
But I hate to think
That I'm in love alone

29:23.138 --> 29:27.601
And there's nothing that I can do, no

29:27.684 --> 29:32.189
-It's too late to turn back now
-To turn back now

29:32.272 --> 29:34.566
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

29:34.650 --> 29:36.527
'Cause I'm falling in love

29:36.610 --> 29:40.155
-It's too late to turn back now
-Oh

29:40.239 --> 29:44.284
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

29:44.368 --> 29:48.121
It's too late to turn back now

29:48.205 --> 29:52.501
I believe, I believe
I believe I'm falling in love

30:00.717 --> 30:03.804
I loved you. I saved you.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.932
I gave you ice.

30:07.391 --> 30:12.062
I loved you. I saved you.
I saved you twice.

30:17.985 --> 30:19.194
I saved you.

30:21.947 --> 30:24.074
I saved you twice.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.214
Tonight and tomorrow, we're gonna be...

30:39.298 --> 30:40.257
Manda?

30:40.340 --> 30:44.636
Close the door, Lisey.
Were you born in a barn? Jesus.

30:46.930 --> 30:48.432
What are you doing out?

30:49.892 --> 30:53.103
According to handsome there,
Robert Frost was right.

30:53.812 --> 30:56.106
The world's gonna end
in ice instead of fire.

30:58.358 --> 31:01.278
Good thing Scott's out west.
It's probably 70 in LA.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.406
He canceled the tour.

31:04.489 --> 31:07.492
What? Mr. Type-A Rock Star Writer?

31:08.076 --> 31:09.661
There's something wrong with him.

31:09.745 --> 31:11.371
Or has been since Christmas.

31:12.623 --> 31:14.875
He's not himself and it's getting worse.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.668
You're telling me this, because wh--

31:16.752 --> 31:21.340
Oh, oh, oh, snap. Of course.
I'm the crazy one in the family.

31:21.423 --> 31:23.133
Because I need someone to talk to.

31:23.217 --> 31:24.843
Sure, but not Darla, right?

31:26.136 --> 31:27.763
'Cause she's not the one
who gorks out sometimes

31:27.846 --> 31:29.556
and has to spend
a couple of days in bed, so...

31:29.640 --> 31:31.892
God, no. Because he talks to you.

31:32.768 --> 31:35.646
You're the only one he talks to,
besides me.

31:37.064 --> 31:40.067
Did he say anything to you?
Did he say anything about being depressed?

31:40.150 --> 31:42.027
About being disconnected?

31:42.110 --> 31:45.405
No. I mean, he seemed a little off.

31:46.114 --> 31:50.702
But not just since Christmas.
I'd say before Thanksgiving.

31:51.870 --> 31:54.039
Did he talk to you
about his childhood, ever?

31:54.122 --> 31:56.542
Has he ever,
ever spoken to you about that?

31:56.625 --> 31:58.877
No. What has he said to you?

32:01.255 --> 32:05.133
-Seriously? Nothing? Never?
-No. He-- No, he-- He did.

32:05.217 --> 32:08.053
He-- He-- He talked to me about it once.

32:09.096 --> 32:12.099
It was a long time ago.
Was right after we were married.

32:12.182 --> 32:15.686
He said that the Landons had a history
of becoming unstuck...

32:15.769 --> 32:17.312
to reality.

32:19.231 --> 32:20.983
He called it "being gone."

32:21.692 --> 32:22.693
Stress, maybe?

32:22.776 --> 32:24.653
He thrives on stress. He loves stress.

32:24.736 --> 32:27.322
It's not that.
It's more like a disease. It's like...

32:30.033 --> 32:32.035
Two types of insanity.

32:32.536 --> 32:35.163
The bad and the gone.

32:36.582 --> 32:37.791
Runs in the blood.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.503
Something in the blood.

32:45.299 --> 32:48.010
You did come to me
because I'm the crazy one.

32:48.093 --> 32:50.804
No. I came because I'm scared.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.640
And I don't want to lose him.

32:56.810 --> 32:59.313
When I withdraw...

33:00.439 --> 33:02.107
it's because I get scared.

33:02.733 --> 33:05.527
I get scared of the future.

33:06.862 --> 33:10.866
Of dying all alone in this house with
no one but my two sisters to mourn me.

33:13.452 --> 33:16.496
And so sometimes I just go into the past
when I was a kid.

33:17.331 --> 33:19.708
When life wasn't so goddamn complicated.

33:20.667 --> 33:24.338
And then sometimes,
you know, when I retreat...

33:25.047 --> 33:27.174
Is it hard to-- to come back?

33:29.176 --> 33:30.928
If I cut myself...

33:32.679 --> 33:35.140
Pain brings me back, but someday it won't.

33:35.224 --> 33:36.975
Oh, God. Just don't say that.

33:37.059 --> 33:38.519
-Don't do that. Don't cut--
-You don't want to hear.

33:38.602 --> 33:40.354
-You don't believe it, but it's--
-Don't cut yourself again.

33:45.275 --> 33:47.653
I should go, because it's gonna get dark.

33:49.321 --> 33:50.989
I don't want to drive when it's dark.

33:51.573 --> 33:53.283
You don't want to leave him alone.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.451
Do you?

33:57.538 --> 33:58.747
Then make it right.

33:59.665 --> 34:02.459
Hold on to him, Lisey. He loves you.

34:03.585 --> 34:07.297
And if there is anyone who can
keep him tethered to this world...

34:08.422 --> 34:09.716
It's me.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.553
It has to be me.

34:23.021 --> 34:24.022
Scott?

34:29.402 --> 34:30.487
Scott?

34:45.127 --> 34:46.335
Scott?

34:48.547 --> 34:49.547
Scott!

35:05.814 --> 35:08.108
Hey. It's freezing up here.

35:09.026 --> 35:10.652
Why don't you come back to the house?

35:16.074 --> 35:17.075
Hey.

35:18.911 --> 35:19.953
What are you doing?

35:21.788 --> 35:22.789
Hey.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.295
Scott.

35:32.674 --> 35:35.886
Okay. Right. Quit messin' around. Come on.

35:37.554 --> 35:38.764
You're scaring me.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.061
Honey.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.729
Hey, hey, honey.

35:46.813 --> 35:48.023
Are you all right?

35:50.234 --> 35:51.276
Hey.

35:54.238 --> 35:55.447
Talk to me.

36:17.261 --> 36:18.846
If you're there...

36:20.055 --> 36:21.265
come back.

36:23.642 --> 36:24.977
Just come back.

36:29.273 --> 36:30.816
Where'd you go?

36:33.110 --> 36:35.612
Do you remember when you cut your hand?

36:35.696 --> 36:38.282
-The night I argued with the laundromat.
-And-- Yeah,

36:38.365 --> 36:41.368
and you cleaned it in the sink
the way that Paul showed you.

36:41.451 --> 36:45.455
Did Paul do that when your dad cut him,
after he made you jump from the barn?

36:45.539 --> 36:47.583
No. That came later.

36:50.377 --> 36:53.839
And Paul's cuts were bad.
They weren't just nicks. They were bad.

36:53.922 --> 36:57.050
Daddy cut deep.
But that's not what you want to ask.

36:57.134 --> 36:58.135
Yeah.

36:58.218 --> 37:00.387
-Ask what you want, and I'll answer...
-Okay. Okay, okay.

37:00.470 --> 37:01.930
-...but you have to ask.
-Okay.

37:02.014 --> 37:04.850
So, when you jumped
from the barn window...

37:04.933 --> 37:06.476
Daddy gave me a kiss.

37:07.519 --> 37:09.313
Kiss is Daddy's prize.

37:11.273 --> 37:14.985
Daddy let the bad
out of Paul and it was over.

37:15.944 --> 37:17.487
Bool, the end.

37:18.447 --> 37:20.073
At least for that day.

37:21.950 --> 37:23.869
But that's not what
you want to ask either.

37:27.289 --> 37:30.417
How did he heal?

37:33.128 --> 37:34.546
How did he get better?

37:37.174 --> 37:38.509
There's a place.

37:41.845 --> 37:42.888
He called it...

37:43.764 --> 37:45.224
Booya Moon.

37:46.058 --> 37:47.851
We called it Booya Moon.

37:53.398 --> 37:54.983
I took him when he was hurt.

37:56.777 --> 37:58.195
And I took him when he was dead.

38:00.781 --> 38:04.535
And I buried him on Sweetheart Hill.

38:05.244 --> 38:08.747
Where we went today. That was our place.

38:10.332 --> 38:13.502
Ask your question. I know what it is,

38:13.585 --> 38:15.420
but you have to ask.

38:18.841 --> 38:20.634
Was it real...

38:22.219 --> 38:23.762
where we went today...

38:25.889 --> 38:27.891
or was it my imagination?

38:38.694 --> 38:41.655
And then... he took me.

38:42.948 --> 38:44.366
If you want...

38:46.994 --> 38:49.204
I'll take you there again.

38:50.664 --> 38:51.665
Yeah.

38:53.542 --> 38:54.543
I do.

39:43.926 --> 39:46.637
-What did you think of?
-The willow tree.

39:48.680 --> 39:52.601
That was good. Better than Paul.

39:54.061 --> 39:57.773
God, the flowers.
Can I touch them? Is it safe?

39:58.315 --> 40:01.902
I took one back once,
but it died right away.

40:03.529 --> 40:06.657
-It's gonna get dark soon.
-It never gets dark here.

40:07.658 --> 40:11.912
The moon is always there,
right above the horizon.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.292
Lisey, look.

40:18.794 --> 40:20.921
Paul made this from a busted crate.

40:25.342 --> 40:27.135
The pool's the best, Lisey.

40:34.309 --> 40:37.312
-Are there people here?
-Yes.

40:39.064 --> 40:40.524
But they're broken.

41:11.138 --> 41:12.347
What's that?

41:26.570 --> 41:28.155
Think of something, Lisey.

41:29.573 --> 41:30.574
Something in the room.

41:40.876 --> 41:44.046
Wh-- What was that?
Wh-- What was that thing?

41:44.546 --> 41:45.756
The long boy.

41:46.798 --> 41:50.594
I've never seen it up close.
I never want to.

41:52.721 --> 41:54.139
I don't want to be here.

42:00.103 --> 42:02.314
We have a long acquaintance,
that thing and I.

42:03.524 --> 42:07.277
Do you remember when I had to take
Paul 'cause Daddy cut him up so bad?

42:08.820 --> 42:10.364
That day it was so close

42:10.447 --> 42:12.533
we could glimpse him through the trees.

42:14.076 --> 42:15.285
It was so tall.

42:16.912 --> 42:17.996
Endless.

42:19.665 --> 42:21.083
And the feelings it brings.

42:22.459 --> 42:23.669
Despair.

42:24.753 --> 42:25.963
Sadness.

42:28.006 --> 42:29.758
-It knows.
-Knows what?

42:29.842 --> 42:30.843
Me.

42:33.178 --> 42:34.304
It calls me.

42:37.057 --> 42:40.769
Can it come through?
Can it come through to us?

42:40.853 --> 42:42.104
Probably not.

42:44.731 --> 42:46.859
I hear it sometimes when I'm writing.

42:48.485 --> 42:50.696
Its mind reaches out to mine.

42:52.614 --> 42:55.701
And nights where I can't sleep,
I hear it coming.

42:57.244 --> 43:01.832
I catch a glimpse of it in a mirror,
or a glass, and I-- I see his face.

43:03.458 --> 43:04.751
Many faces.

43:07.754 --> 43:09.006
And I wish...

43:11.675 --> 43:13.635
I do, so-- sometimes, I...

43:17.681 --> 43:19.516
But now I have you, Lisey.

43:20.767 --> 43:22.186
And you keep me here.

43:23.562 --> 43:24.813
You're my anchor.

43:25.522 --> 43:27.566
There are anchors here and there.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.152
Anchors and doubles.

43:30.235 --> 43:31.528
What do you mean?

43:32.154 --> 43:33.655
Sometimes, I'm a double.

43:35.240 --> 43:37.034
Paul never was.

43:39.286 --> 43:42.664
But there's so much that I don't know,
that I can only guess.

43:42.748 --> 43:45.709
Like how water connects
Booya Moon to our world.

43:45.792 --> 43:49.630
-How you can go and most people can't.
-Because I had you to help me.

43:50.255 --> 43:51.757
But the pool heals.

43:53.467 --> 43:54.885
That I know for sure.

43:56.220 --> 43:59.097
You know, that's where I took Paul
when Daddy cut him.

43:59.848 --> 44:02.684
-We were on the path to the pool.
-So you could make him better.

44:03.810 --> 44:05.938
So you could make him better
the way you made yourself better

44:06.021 --> 44:07.523
after you cut your arm.

44:09.149 --> 44:10.442
Yeah.

44:14.696 --> 44:15.906
And then it came.

44:19.076 --> 44:20.244
The long boy.

44:22.079 --> 44:23.288
Go. Get out of here.

44:24.498 --> 44:27.709
And don't try and trick me again
with that water business.

44:50.732 --> 44:53.151
Scott, do you hear that?

44:59.366 --> 45:00.450
What is that?

45:01.118 --> 45:02.327
I don't know.

45:03.412 --> 45:05.581
-I don't want to be here.
-It's okay.

45:10.627 --> 45:12.880
Paul, where are you going?

45:15.883 --> 45:18.093
Paul, it's this way. Paul.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.686
Paul!

45:30.480 --> 45:32.357
Where are you going? Paul!

45:32.858 --> 45:37.738
For some reason, Paul couldn't
stop himself from moving towards it.

45:38.739 --> 45:40.949
Paul! Paul, don't go there.

45:44.244 --> 45:45.245
Paul!

45:45.829 --> 45:47.039
Paul, come back!

45:47.831 --> 45:48.832
Paul!

45:59.885 --> 46:02.054
I told you not to go there! I told you!

46:02.137 --> 46:05.182
He got my arm. He got my arm.

46:05.265 --> 46:07.476
It's okay, Paul. The pool will fix it.

46:07.559 --> 46:10.646
The pool will fix everything,
like it always does.

46:11.480 --> 46:12.731
Come on, come on.

46:24.368 --> 46:25.494
It went away.

46:29.373 --> 46:30.582
But it marked us.

46:34.795 --> 46:36.004
Knew us.

46:40.384 --> 46:44.012
We went there other times
before Paul died.

46:49.643 --> 46:51.228
And now when I think of it...

46:53.355 --> 46:54.773
it thinks of me.

46:56.900 --> 46:58.277
Well, then don't.

46:59.653 --> 47:01.113
Don't think of it.

47:04.867 --> 47:06.994
I need to know one more thing
about your brother.

47:07.494 --> 47:09.746
No more, no more, no more.
No more, no more.

47:09.830 --> 47:12.499
-Why is it backwards?
-Because she carved it on her arm.

47:12.583 --> 47:15.502
-Because she carved it on her arm.
-Because she carved it on her arm.

47:15.586 --> 47:16.920
Do you know what this is?

47:17.004 --> 47:18.422
Are you there?

47:19.673 --> 47:21.133
Squeeze my hand.

47:22.050 --> 47:24.219
Squeeze my hand if you're there.

47:28.765 --> 47:30.017
Are you at the pool?

47:32.561 --> 47:34.688
Did you go to the pool to get better?

47:38.483 --> 47:40.277
Do you want to come back?

47:40.360 --> 47:42.404
I want to come back.

47:43.113 --> 47:44.990
From where? Wh-- Wh--

47:45.073 --> 47:48.035
-I wanna come home.
-Okay, okay.

47:48.118 --> 47:49.620
Do you want to come home?

47:53.582 --> 47:55.083
Then you have to help me.

47:57.044 --> 47:59.129
I don't know how to do this without you.

48:01.840 --> 48:02.925
So tell me.

48:08.722 --> 48:10.724
Help me. Okay?

48:13.018 --> 48:14.228
Help me.

48:16.271 --> 48:18.315
Help me! Help me!

48:20.275 --> 48:23.487
There's so much that I don't know,
that I can only guess.

48:24.655 --> 48:27.908
How water connects
Booya Moon to our world.

48:28.867 --> 48:31.370
How you can go when most people can't.

48:33.539 --> 48:34.748
You're a natural.
