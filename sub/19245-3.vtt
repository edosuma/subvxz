00:11.183 --> 00:12.693
- _
- I am no longer governor.

00:12.729 --> 00:13.891
I will be in charge...

00:13.926 --> 00:15.883
What we learn from her may yet save lives.

00:19.307 --> 00:21.601
Bears don't come into town
here unless they're starving.

00:21.636 --> 00:24.356
The victim was murdered and decapitated.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.958
Is Rune involved in what happened?

00:26.993 --> 00:29.000
- I'm trying.
- I know you're trying.

01:31.223 --> 01:32.221
Okay.

01:33.318 --> 01:35.444
I'm talking to you as your sister.

01:35.479 --> 01:36.765
As opposed to what?

01:39.568 --> 01:43.330
Laszlo Hindemith was found dead.
The place was full of drugs.

01:43.365 --> 01:45.135
Your belt was in his bed.

01:45.170 --> 01:48.055
I lost that belt. Weeks ago.

01:48.116 --> 01:48.871
Where?

01:48.906 --> 01:51.169
If I knew that, Ingrid,
I wouldn't have lost it.

01:53.502 --> 01:56.222
Where were you when Hindemith was killed?

02:02.277 --> 02:04.503
Rune Lennox, you're under
arrest for suspicion of murder.

02:04.538 --> 02:05.880
- What?
- And fuck your rights.

02:07.697 --> 02:08.630
Woah...

02:09.339 --> 02:10.151
Shit.

02:10.961 --> 02:16.153
This is Eric... Tavrani Tavra is
now a murder suspect, repeat...

02:16.207 --> 02:18.678
- Tavra is a murder suspect...
- That was him.

02:18.734 --> 02:22.653
Apprehend and arrest.
Repeat. Apprehend and arrest.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.181
Eric, I just saw him, he went
right in front of me, he's heading

02:27.216 --> 02:28.349
East out of town.

02:40.023 --> 02:40.957
There he is!

02:47.450 --> 02:48.454
Go right at the fork.

04:04.497 --> 04:05.970
Good morning, Hildur.

04:12.955 --> 04:15.675
I assume that's not government property?

04:17.123 --> 04:20.982
- The mouse mat?
- Yes. The mouse mat.

04:34.245 --> 04:36.568
This is your notice of termination.

04:36.603 --> 04:41.775
It includes a legally binding
confidentiality clause.

04:41.853 --> 04:47.579
Three copies, each of the
three requires a signature.

04:50.301 --> 04:54.230
I have also prepared a press release.

05:01.939 --> 05:05.471
"Looking forward to new
challenges in local government".

05:05.541 --> 05:08.109
Let's not make it any
harder than it has to be.

05:15.395 --> 05:19.765
Erling Munk.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.274
Dmitri Podnikov?

05:24.275 --> 05:26.390
He's the Mayor of Vukobejina.

05:28.835 --> 05:31.278
If it's an official call,
you must hand it back to me.

05:36.562 --> 05:38.146
_

05:40.308 --> 05:43.225
_

05:43.675 --> 05:44.643
_

05:51.813 --> 05:53.922
_

05:54.449 --> 05:55.725
_

05:57.769 --> 05:58.874
_

06:04.411 --> 06:08.807
- I speak excellent Russian.
- I know.

07:12.118 --> 07:13.598
I thought it was a wasp.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.572
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.581
Really?

07:21.859 --> 07:26.944
Yeah, yeah. I'm fi... I'm fine.

07:29.388 --> 07:32.548
Okay then, let's go.

07:34.540 --> 07:37.154
- You want milk?
- What?

07:38.315 --> 07:39.892
With your Americano.

07:41.155 --> 07:43.904
You don't put milk in an Americano.

07:45.835 --> 07:47.887
It's the only one you don't but milk in.

07:47.944 --> 07:52.927
That's why they call it an
Americano. Not a Latte, for example.

07:52.962 --> 07:55.595
Or a Cappuccino.

07:55.715 --> 07:57.338
You're the guy that killed the bear.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.394
So?

07:59.441 --> 08:01.121
Coffee expert too!

08:03.499 --> 08:04.812
You're welcome.

08:05.875 --> 08:08.847
An Americano with milk.

08:11.637 --> 08:14.192
I need you to take me round
the coast of Vukobejina.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.866
The Mayor just called me, for a meeting.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.315
You've got a chopper, get
you there in half hour.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.415
What the fuck do you need a boat for?

08:21.460 --> 08:23.500
I like the sea air.

08:26.609 --> 08:28.806
Hildy, you hate the sea air.

08:30.164 --> 08:33.410
So obviously you have some
good reason to lie to my face.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.044
I'll pay you, of course.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.636
No, thank you, Governor.
I don't need your charity.

08:41.585 --> 08:45.342
I'm not the Governor
any more. They fired me.

08:46.049 --> 08:47.984
They didn't.

08:48.054 --> 08:49.464
They fucking did.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.361
Oh, Hildy, I'm sorry.

08:55.279 --> 08:58.319
Thank you. Yes.

09:00.951 --> 09:04.711
I got Hindemith's killer...
it's Tavrani Tavra.

09:06.352 --> 09:07.875
The taxidermist?

09:08.585 --> 09:10.685
What... they can't kill people?

09:10.763 --> 09:14.344
No, I was just, surprised.

09:14.345 --> 09:18.264
We're looking into motive,
but it's, it's definitely him.

09:18.546 --> 09:19.707
Okay.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.063
You don't seem very interested.

09:25.152 --> 09:29.711
No. No. That's, err,
that's good. Of course.

09:30.025 --> 09:31.785
Thanks for letting me know.

09:33.785 --> 09:36.554
- Are you okay?
- Sure. Listen. I have to go.

09:41.936 --> 09:43.016
Well?

09:43.895 --> 09:45.455
I'll take your charity.

09:52.911 --> 09:54.392
Brain scan's clear.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.280
Pity.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.104
Ingrid? Need you to get over to Tavra's.

10:04.163 --> 10:07.021
Lock it down and start a
search before it gets dark.

10:07.086 --> 10:07.982
Okay.

10:08.757 --> 10:11.443
Don't worry. I'll do everything.

10:22.225 --> 10:25.445
Doctor... where the hell's Dan Anderssen?

10:30.465 --> 10:31.493
I don't know.

10:31.575 --> 10:34.016
You told us he was sort of... dead.

10:37.056 --> 10:40.257
He is arisen.

10:46.139 --> 10:47.517
I'm Dr. Khatri.

10:49.825 --> 10:51.064
I'm Dan.

10:51.383 --> 10:53.464
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

10:53.527 --> 10:55.034
I want to see Elena.

10:55.098 --> 10:57.153
So I was told. Are you a relative?

10:57.602 --> 11:01.879
No. I tried to kill her. But I missed.

11:03.985 --> 11:05.225
Call the hospital.

11:06.675 --> 11:10.170
She's everything to
me. The love of my life.

11:12.591 --> 11:13.957
You're the Sheriff?

11:15.105 --> 11:19.424
Err, I'm sorry. I heard
you were... very unwell.

11:19.581 --> 11:21.093
I want to see Elena.

11:53.905 --> 11:59.304
I'm afraid her coma is the severest
type, a metabolic encephalopathy.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.006
But she's in no pain.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.363
Is it because I shot her?

12:06.433 --> 12:07.984
Not at all.

12:07.985 --> 12:10.631
She was attacked by wasps from
the mammoth and infected with a

12:10.666 --> 12:14.295
tiny parasitic organism... a toxoplasma.

12:14.745 --> 12:16.274
We've seen nothing like it.

12:16.309 --> 12:19.324
It's been in deep freeze in the
permafrost for thousands of years.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.002
Her immune system is fighting it.

12:21.058 --> 12:23.657
We're helping her fight
it in every way we can.

12:24.338 --> 12:26.217
Can she hear me?

12:26.291 --> 12:27.688
I'm afraid not.

12:27.723 --> 12:29.925
She doesn't know I'm here?

12:29.985 --> 12:32.661
She's asleep, Mr.
Anderssen. She knows nothing.

12:33.383 --> 12:34.904
Will she wake up?

12:34.982 --> 12:37.342
The machines are keeping her alive.

12:41.265 --> 12:42.638
Why the security?

12:45.886 --> 12:47.469
It's just a precaution.

12:47.988 --> 12:49.601
She's the only survivor we have.

12:49.704 --> 12:51.625
We still don't know
what we're dealing with.

13:01.082 --> 13:03.762
Please feel free to
visit any time you like.

13:17.012 --> 13:21.322
Did they say why? They fired you?

13:21.357 --> 13:23.623
Ignoring the fuel quota.

13:25.852 --> 13:28.085
That was the official excuse.

13:30.705 --> 13:33.072
Was there an unofficial one?

13:33.138 --> 13:36.712
In politics, always.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.560
You did the right thing.

13:52.697 --> 13:56.716
There it is. The Arctic Riviera.

14:55.545 --> 15:03.025
Eric? Petra? Who's there?

16:03.965 --> 16:09.956
Dan. Are you alright?

16:12.165 --> 16:13.678
I'm a bit dizzy.

16:14.685 --> 16:16.044
What are you doing here?

16:16.045 --> 16:20.524
I went to see Elena. She
doesn't want to be there.

16:20.525 --> 16:21.724
What?

16:21.725 --> 16:24.404
She's not happy.

16:24.405 --> 16:26.675
Dr. Khatri's taking good care of her.

16:27.805 --> 16:30.844
I didn't like Dr. Khatri.

16:30.845 --> 16:32.844
You need to go back to hospital.

16:32.845 --> 16:35.204
I didn't like her at all.

16:39.325 --> 16:41.364
I'm getting you back to hospital now.

16:41.421 --> 16:46.965
No, you're not, Eric. I'm fine. Really.

16:54.005 --> 16:57.487
Okay. If you're not going back to
hospital, you're staying with us.

17:00.782 --> 17:01.923
Your call.

17:14.971 --> 17:16.891
How was it?

17:16.948 --> 17:24.553
Cold. Wet. Here...

17:28.204 --> 17:29.416
Thank you, Rune.

17:43.711 --> 17:44.795
Ingrid just called.

17:44.847 --> 17:47.046
Oh, mum. She's being ridiculous.

17:47.197 --> 17:50.615
It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Please.

17:55.979 --> 17:57.051
Okay, baby.

18:07.567 --> 18:11.760
Hey! Hey! Hey! Mum. Mum. Open the door!

18:11.795 --> 18:17.904
Mum! MUM! MUM!

18:17.962 --> 18:19.122
Where's the head?

18:19.308 --> 18:21.428
- What?
- My head. Where is it?

18:22.405 --> 18:25.339
It's not really your head, is it?

18:25.391 --> 18:28.590
I mean, technically it used
to belong to someone else.

18:28.685 --> 18:31.155
- I'll ask the questions.
- First you tell me where it is.

18:33.565 --> 18:36.364
It's here. In a fridge.

18:36.427 --> 18:37.427
It's evidence.

18:42.167 --> 18:49.115
Okay. I killed Hindemith.

18:52.684 --> 18:56.324
We know you killed him. You
had his head in your fridge.

18:57.169 --> 18:59.041
We want to know why you did it.

19:03.405 --> 19:09.124
I killed him... I killed
him because he was crazy.

19:09.125 --> 19:14.468
His soul was in torment.
He was, erm... I...

19:16.650 --> 19:19.833
Anyway, I released him. He was happy.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.279
It was all good.

19:22.318 --> 19:24.029
- Happy?
- Yeah.

19:24.451 --> 19:28.810
So you took his head. As a souvenir?

19:28.909 --> 19:30.269
He didn't need it.

19:33.893 --> 19:36.280
- Who's been living with you?
- No one.

19:37.750 --> 19:40.509
There was a holdall on
a bed. With clothes in.

19:40.644 --> 19:41.924
And a hunting knife.

19:44.271 --> 19:45.977
You should never have come.
You should have stayed away.

19:46.024 --> 19:47.217
Someone took it. Just now.

19:47.261 --> 19:49.474
You don't know what this is,
you don't know what you're doing.

19:49.553 --> 19:51.421
WHO TOOK IT?

19:55.456 --> 20:00.987
The demon is among us. We're
going to die. All of us.

20:01.845 --> 20:03.445
Nothing else can save us.

20:07.997 --> 20:10.944
Slow down, Natalie. What's that there?

20:38.970 --> 20:40.204
The deer was eating it.

20:40.205 --> 20:42.484
That's not possible. They're herbivores.

20:42.485 --> 20:44.732
Bears prey on reindeer.
Not the other way round.

20:45.528 --> 20:46.593
Did it kill it?

20:47.293 --> 20:48.823
That's not possible either.

20:50.406 --> 20:57.493
Fuck! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

20:57.528 --> 20:58.688
FUCK!

21:02.800 --> 21:09.168
It's out here, you know it
is, it's fucking everywhere.

21:10.611 --> 21:14.530
They're fucked. We're
fucked. Everything's FUCKED.

21:14.625 --> 21:16.044
Vince.

21:16.045 --> 21:19.060
It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

21:20.382 --> 21:24.761
I'll go get the tents, you saw
up the corpses for samples. Okay?

21:34.325 --> 21:35.417
FUCK!

21:45.245 --> 21:47.045
I'll be dead by the morning.

22:07.825 --> 22:10.061
I found his belt in Hindemith's place.

22:10.845 --> 22:13.844
I wanted to deal with it. I'm sorry.

22:13.914 --> 22:15.693
I wasn't sure it was important.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.333
Important?

22:19.371 --> 22:22.967
Someone took a holdall from
Tavra's... it could have been him!

22:24.525 --> 22:26.001
He won't talk to me.

22:26.886 --> 22:30.006
Fine. He can talk to me.

22:35.965 --> 22:37.764
What's your meeting about?

22:37.881 --> 22:40.070
Ah. He didn't say, exactly.

22:42.406 --> 22:46.286
Does he know you're not governor any more?

22:47.645 --> 22:50.724
I haven't told anyone yet.

22:50.725 --> 22:53.065
He didn't want to talk on
the phone. He sounded...

22:53.100 --> 22:54.597
Where is everyone?

22:59.205 --> 23:01.364
He sounded what?

23:01.365 --> 23:02.525
Scared.

23:07.613 --> 23:09.960
I'm not gonna make it home by nightfall.

23:10.845 --> 23:13.000
I'm gonna find us a place to stay.

23:13.652 --> 23:15.614
Okay. Good.

23:27.187 --> 23:28.724
Hildur.

23:28.725 --> 23:30.165
Dmitri.

23:36.323 --> 23:40.181
Hildur, this is Major Potemkin
of the Federal Security Service.

23:40.249 --> 23:42.568
He just arrived today.

23:42.685 --> 23:47.389
Unfortunately Governor Odegard
speaks no Russian... but luckily

23:47.424 --> 23:51.853
Major Potemkin has a little English
so he can follow our conversation.

23:51.900 --> 23:53.884
Oh, good. Very good.

23:53.976 --> 23:57.101
So, what brings you to
Vukobejina, Governor?

23:58.670 --> 24:02.190
I just, err, wanted to say
goodbye in person, Dmitri.

24:02.225 --> 24:03.738
I'm leaving Fortitude.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.051
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:05.122 --> 24:09.592
We have always been able to
meet and share our problems.

24:09.678 --> 24:14.124
I'm looking forward to new
challenges in local government.

24:14.172 --> 24:18.172
I see. I only hope I'll share
the same excellent working

24:18.207 --> 24:21.006
relationship with your successor.

24:21.165 --> 24:24.159
I can't tell you how much I respect him.

24:25.085 --> 24:29.644
I know you leave Fortitude a much
better place than you found it.

24:29.685 --> 24:33.384
Well, sadly, not everybody
would agree with that.

24:34.765 --> 24:39.524
- But things here are great.
- Yes.

24:39.525 --> 24:43.524
It's, erm, certainly nice and quiet.

24:43.525 --> 24:47.199
On the surface maybe, but
underneath Vukobejina is a very

24:47.234 --> 24:48.743
happening place.

24:48.778 --> 24:51.204
With such a fascinating history.

24:51.205 --> 24:56.764
You remember my interest in local history?

24:56.765 --> 24:58.564
Of course.

24:58.565 --> 25:02.901
I'd love to tell you about it some time.

25:02.936 --> 25:06.539
Yes, I'm, err, staying at
the hotel tonight, so....

25:11.891 --> 25:15.498
Well, thank you for
making time for me, Dmitri.

25:16.821 --> 25:18.230
God be with us all.

25:20.772 --> 25:21.769
Yes.

26:53.725 --> 26:55.964
I'm sorry about before.

26:55.965 --> 27:02.404
I, I overreacted and it was,
undignified and unscientific.

27:02.405 --> 27:03.725
Yeah.

27:08.752 --> 27:13.199
When I was a kid, I
wanted to be a magician.

27:13.253 --> 27:14.324
What?

27:14.325 --> 27:17.444
Just saying. Y'know. Bit of background.

27:19.245 --> 27:22.392
Right. Do you want to do it?

27:25.405 --> 27:26.444
Huh?

27:26.445 --> 27:28.005
With me. Now. It.

27:31.059 --> 27:34.255
It's not a new advance
in epigenetics, Vincent...

27:35.678 --> 27:38.209
It's a simple Yes or No answer.

27:38.763 --> 27:39.963
Yeah.

27:41.245 --> 27:45.964
Fully clothed in one
sleeping bag? Can't be done.

27:46.027 --> 27:48.114
We're scientists, Vincent.

27:51.005 --> 27:56.165
We explore the furthest boundaries
of the possible. It's what we do.

27:56.965 --> 28:01.125
Well... when you put it like that.

28:37.251 --> 28:38.457
_

29:04.495 --> 29:08.157
_

29:18.805 --> 29:24.525
Eric. Thanks for coming in. Please.

29:27.547 --> 29:29.631
Great news about the murder.

29:29.695 --> 29:31.261
There are still some loose ends.

29:31.296 --> 29:33.242
Ah, and I'm sure you'll tie them up.

29:35.611 --> 29:40.575
Eric, you've been acting Sheriff
for a while now, with great

29:40.641 --> 29:45.912
distinction... it's time
to make it permanent.

29:47.375 --> 29:50.605
What about Dan? He seems much better.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.219
It's, it's amazing.

29:53.317 --> 30:02.714
Sick leave. Forever.
Congratulations, Sheriff Odegard!

30:03.805 --> 30:06.044
But, the governor of
Fortitude appoints the Sheriff.

30:06.090 --> 30:07.397
What's your point?

30:07.478 --> 30:08.731
Not Oslo.

30:10.797 --> 30:14.476
I'm sorry, I thought
you, I assumed you knew.

30:14.559 --> 30:19.444
Your wife was relieved
of her duties yesterday.

30:19.445 --> 30:21.925
I am now acting governor of Fortitude.

30:25.685 --> 30:32.884
Eric. Eric, I need you to focus now.

30:32.885 --> 30:35.424
The town has been through terrible things.

30:36.166 --> 30:37.844
It needs to get back to normal.

30:45.085 --> 30:46.364
Ingrid? Yes, what?

30:48.788 --> 30:49.757
What?

30:51.959 --> 30:55.959
What? Call Petra in. I'll meet you there.

30:59.885 --> 31:00.845
What?

31:38.790 --> 31:40.270
It's coming.

31:58.025 --> 31:59.569
Jesus, Hildy.

32:00.842 --> 32:02.952
That icy nordic gloom.

32:06.785 --> 32:10.104
Come on, let's face it.

32:10.190 --> 32:16.970
- My shit is way worse than yours is!
- How is that?

32:17.005 --> 32:19.777
I bet you got a big fat payoff.

32:20.468 --> 32:21.825
You can sell your boat!

32:21.860 --> 32:24.776
- Buff up your resume.
- I'm middle-aged!

32:24.811 --> 32:26.408
It's a bureaucrat's best years.

32:26.443 --> 32:28.187
I'm unemployable!

32:28.222 --> 32:34.664
So what? Who cares? So you
retire and live off Eric.

32:34.665 --> 32:38.223
With Eric. Is what I meant.

32:41.705 --> 32:43.576
No, I don't think I can.

32:45.465 --> 32:46.825
Hmm?

32:48.448 --> 32:50.648
I don't think I love Eric anymore.

32:53.145 --> 33:00.704
Oh, you are so fucking competitive.

33:00.705 --> 33:01.291
What?

33:01.352 --> 33:03.008
It doesn't matter how bad my shit is,

33:03.043 --> 33:05.532
yours is always gotta be worse. Doesn't it?

33:05.585 --> 33:08.257
- Bullshit!
- You were always like that.

33:08.292 --> 33:10.944
- No, I wasn't!
- Unbelievable.

33:17.585 --> 33:21.374
Look, for what it's worth, I'm sorry.

33:24.385 --> 33:25.549
Yeah.

33:28.425 --> 33:29.790
Have you told him?

33:34.665 --> 33:39.556
You should probably
mention it. At some point.

33:42.405 --> 33:47.348
Trust me, for that conversation,
there is no 'good time'.

33:50.585 --> 33:53.744
As I'm sure that we both remember.

33:54.842 --> 33:56.210
You broke my heart.

33:56.245 --> 33:59.439
You broke mine first.

33:59.485 --> 34:00.982
You broke mine worse.

34:01.034 --> 34:02.686
Unbelievable.

34:08.202 --> 34:14.581
Ugh! Damn, this vodka's good.
I want to get out of here.

34:14.617 --> 34:16.542
You're right. Let's get a bottle.

34:16.612 --> 34:17.851
Yeah.

34:18.031 --> 34:19.351
Get a bottle.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.081
Mr. Anderssen. Do you know what time it is?

34:55.630 --> 34:58.271
No. I came to see Elena.

34:58.331 --> 35:01.358
Well, I'm afraid it's not convenient.

35:01.411 --> 35:03.340
Why's that? Is she busy?

35:03.418 --> 35:05.280
It's not possible now, Mr. Anderssen.

35:05.315 --> 35:07.398
- Why?
- I'm her doctor.

35:08.006 --> 35:11.080
You said feel free to
visit anytime you like.

35:11.158 --> 35:12.701
I don't have to explain myself.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.456
Those were your words.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.514
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

35:18.863 --> 35:20.703
I just want to say "good night".

36:00.171 --> 36:01.965
It's me. We may have a problem here.

36:02.039 --> 36:03.864
Something unexpected.

36:28.070 --> 36:31.701
It's a girl. Lief Ericson saw
her when he was driving home.

36:33.639 --> 36:35.479
- Where's her head?
- It's gone.

36:37.166 --> 36:39.245
I can see that.

36:39.319 --> 36:40.926
Then why did you ask?

36:42.126 --> 36:44.426
We think it's been
taken. Like the other one.

36:46.143 --> 36:48.142
Hindemith.

36:48.177 --> 36:51.475
I know his name. Jesus, Jesus Christ!

36:52.746 --> 36:54.589
I have to report to Munk.

36:57.759 --> 37:00.864
Why is anyone reporting to Munk?

37:04.046 --> 37:06.646
At least we know Tavra didn't do this one.

37:49.942 --> 37:51.102
Hey!

37:56.855 --> 37:57.935
Ingrid?

38:12.485 --> 38:13.845
I'm sorry.

38:24.697 --> 38:28.061
INGRID... INGRID...

38:28.127 --> 38:29.584
INGRIIIIIIID!

38:29.619 --> 38:30.737
INGRIIIIIIID!

38:33.405 --> 38:35.154
Did you see that guy in the bar?

38:35.189 --> 38:36.348
Hmm.

38:36.486 --> 38:39.406
I think he was watching us.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.709
Err, it's just probably routine.

38:41.853 --> 38:45.028
I bet you anything they watch
all the unemployed governors and

38:45.094 --> 38:47.290
bankrupt trawlermen that pass through.

38:50.790 --> 38:53.229
You were always good at that.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.839
- What?
- Making me laugh.

38:55.891 --> 38:59.270
Yeah. Just not anything else.

39:03.550 --> 39:06.030
What will you do when you sell the boat?

39:10.308 --> 39:17.507
Freya's sick. She's real sick.

39:17.565 --> 39:19.270
There's no cure.

39:21.430 --> 39:24.429
What?

39:24.485 --> 39:30.746
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

39:30.781 --> 39:35.660
You just get weaker and then
one day you just can't breathe.

39:35.725 --> 39:38.262
Oh, no, Michael...

39:41.271 --> 39:43.322
Everybody dies, Hildur.

39:44.312 --> 39:46.414
You... you know, you just
hope it's not too soon.

39:46.511 --> 39:53.842
You know, you hope it doesn't hurt
too much. Nobody gets out alive.

39:58.798 --> 40:01.058
Tough on Rune and Ingrid though.

40:01.902 --> 40:06.414
Yeah. Tough on them.

40:15.182 --> 40:17.115
Okay, your shit is worse than mine.

40:22.968 --> 40:26.367
Yes. That's something.

40:59.558 --> 41:00.638
Go round the back!

41:00.766 --> 41:03.967
INGRID! INGRID!

41:24.630 --> 41:25.614
Rune!

41:28.405 --> 41:29.916
Tavrani's tongue was cut out.

41:29.951 --> 41:33.138
What? The head's gone. It's been taken.

41:33.197 --> 41:34.879
How did they get in?

41:34.945 --> 41:36.738
How did they get out?

41:37.196 --> 41:38.779
I'll call the ambulance.

41:38.845 --> 41:40.440
He spoke to Tavra.

41:42.918 --> 41:47.078
I've heard the voice before. I think.

41:48.679 --> 41:49.799
Where?

42:18.774 --> 42:20.279
These are carrots.

42:35.325 --> 42:36.485
Blood.

42:41.730 --> 42:43.998
This is where she was killed, isn't it?

42:46.894 --> 42:47.915
Who was?

43:09.925 --> 43:13.249
Vince. Vince, Vince...

43:13.284 --> 43:14.371
What are you looking for?

43:14.406 --> 43:19.942
Turn the light on. Please put the light on.

43:20.098 --> 43:20.957
It's okay. I'm here.

43:21.023 --> 43:22.609
You're here, there's nothing else...

43:22.677 --> 43:24.237
Please put the light on.

43:32.536 --> 43:33.660
What?

43:34.118 --> 43:35.624
Fucking torch is dead.

43:35.694 --> 43:37.813
I put new batteries in this morning.

43:37.885 --> 43:38.973
Vince.

43:43.286 --> 43:48.551
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry I... I woke you.

43:49.289 --> 43:50.500
I'm s...

43:57.982 --> 44:02.907
I'm okay. I'm... I'm fine.

44:02.961 --> 44:05.306
Just... go back to sleep.

44:07.815 --> 44:08.846
Natalie.

44:12.045 --> 44:13.311
It's okay.

44:15.694 --> 44:17.210
Come here. Come here. It's okay.

44:17.790 --> 44:19.598
It's just a nightmare. I'll be fine.

44:27.934 --> 44:29.814
Everything's gonna be okay.

44:39.236 --> 44:40.072
Yeah.

44:45.607 --> 44:46.835
- _
- There's clear evidence of complex

44:46.870 --> 44:48.791
- tissue regeneration.
- WERE YOU ALONE?

44:48.857 --> 44:50.555
I can't go on like this.

44:50.590 --> 44:51.980
Still nothing... in either eye?

44:52.035 --> 44:55.492
Still, you come here, into
this shitty little office.

44:55.828 --> 44:57.827
Enough!

44:57.945 --> 44:59.959
We're dealing with a fucking psychopath.
