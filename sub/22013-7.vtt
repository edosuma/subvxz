You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.653
-Previously on Empire...
-CLAUDIA: Synesthesia.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.655
His brain's been rewired.
He listens to music

00:21.689 --> 00:24.658
-and sees colors.
-LEONARD: Mr. Barker would

00:24.692 --> 00:27.328
-come on board at Empire?
-Special advisor to your CEO,

00:27.361 --> 00:29.563
-Cookie Lyon.
-This is Simon Lambert.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.565
He's a medicating psychiatrist
with a very

00:31.599 --> 00:34.034
exclusive patient list.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.403
I started seeing somebody.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.538
Morning, Detective.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.341
JAMAL: He's different.
He could be my one.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.042
DIANA:
Warren, you're up next.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.544
I trust you're up

00:43.577 --> 00:45.179
-to the task?
-I'm ready.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.448
COOKIE: She played you.
She played you against

00:47.481 --> 00:49.383
-your own family.
-BARNES: This court awards

00:49.417 --> 00:52.353
-full custody to Anika Calhoun.
-Yes! (laughs)

00:52.386 --> 00:54.088
-(gavel bangs)
-LUCIOUS: That's the last time

00:54.122 --> 00:56.257
I'll sit in a courtroom
where people decide

00:56.290 --> 00:57.625
what's gonna happen
to my babies.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.360
I want blood to pour
like a river,

00:59.393 --> 01:01.929
and I'm-a make that happen,
I promise you.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.666
(piano playing)

01:19.913 --> 01:22.316
LUCIOUS:
This is green.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.053
Add a little yellow.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.488
Here it is, right here.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.822
All in sequence.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.091
-Lime green...
-(starts playing)

01:31.125 --> 01:32.560
...yellow, violet

01:32.593 --> 01:34.528
and magenta.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.931
LUCIOUS:
Get up.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.470
Do it.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.613
Warren, can you move, please?

01:56.284 --> 01:58.286
(starts playing)

02:16.337 --> 02:17.971
Hell yeah, you play piano.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.407
(chuckles)

02:25.846 --> 02:27.415
You're back.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.786
(kids laughing)

02:32.820 --> 02:34.722
ANIKA:
Um... (laughs)

02:34.755 --> 02:37.124
No, it's true.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.827
Classical music is proven
to make children smarter.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.295
-They have books written
about it. -I'm sure they do.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.730
I'm just saying, you know,

02:42.763 --> 02:44.332
you got to make sure she gets

02:44.365 --> 02:46.200
-a little Luther, you know...
-Right. -(fusses)

02:46.234 --> 02:49.403
-Patti LaBelle, Stevie Wonder...
-(laughs) Yes.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.472
And maybe when you're old
enough, some Rick James?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.341
-That's what she's singing
right now. -"Rick James."

02:53.374 --> 02:55.376
"Rick James."
(laughs)

02:55.409 --> 02:57.245
-Your daughter is beautiful.
-Oh, thank you.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.380
-What's her name?
-Her name's Bella.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.649
Hi, Bella.
What a pretty name.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.351
-Say "Thank you."
-(laughs)

03:03.384 --> 03:04.818
Yes, yes, it is.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.053
-And she has her daddy's eyes.
-Oh...

03:06.086 --> 03:07.755
(woman chuckles)

03:07.788 --> 03:11.058
-How old is she?
-Uh, she's 15 months.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.694
Well, you're a lovely family.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.496
-I wouldn't do that if I was
you. -What you doing here?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.565
-Stopping you from doing
something stupid. -You know

03:17.598 --> 03:20.334
what's stupid? They're out there
showing off Bella like she's

03:20.368 --> 03:22.403
-theirs. -ANIKA: Thank you.
-Yeah, well, what do you think

03:22.436 --> 03:24.338
running up on them in broad
daylight's gonna accomplish,

03:24.372 --> 03:26.407
other than you getting
locked up? And not for nothing,

03:26.440 --> 03:28.442
-Cookie would leave you in jail.
-Yeah, but I'd get her back.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.411
Hak, we're gonna
get her back, okay?

03:30.444 --> 03:32.780
-We just got to be smart
about it. -Aah! (vocalizing)

03:32.813 --> 03:34.181
All right, now, let's
get out of here before NYPD

03:34.214 --> 03:36.183
shows up saying
the sight of two black men

03:36.216 --> 03:37.918
made them fear for their lives.
Come on.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.389
*

03:46.394 --> 03:48.696
* From the dawn of creation *

03:48.729 --> 03:51.632
* From the dust of the womb *

03:51.665 --> 03:53.934
* From the bowels
of the matrix *

03:53.967 --> 03:56.437
* We will rise like the Louvre *

03:56.470 --> 03:59.607
* Camera flashes
and torchlights *

03:59.640 --> 04:01.609
* Ceremonial hues *

04:01.642 --> 04:04.912
Here comes the hook.
Drop the EQ on the drums now.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.648
* Every day we could lose, so *

04:07.681 --> 04:09.249
* So don't bring me
no bad news *

04:09.283 --> 04:10.751
Hey, don't...
What are you doing?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.386
-What are you doing?
Come on, man. -What?

04:12.420 --> 04:15.323
We've been thr... How many times
have we done this al...?

04:15.356 --> 04:17.425
Tory, we're gonna start
from the top, all right?

04:17.458 --> 04:20.594
-Why, what's wrong? -Got
a little EQ problem, no biggie.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.763
Okay.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.065
My bad.
I guess I'm a little tired.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.435
BECKY: Actually,
we're all a little tired.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.069
Eddie, we've been here
all night.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.238
Guys, once we nail this,

04:31.271 --> 04:33.173
it's gonna be worth it,
I promise you.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.408
Becky, you want
to order some coffee

04:34.442 --> 04:35.609
and breakfast or something?

04:35.643 --> 04:39.513
(scoffs quietly)
Wow.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.449
Uh, can you get on that?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.283
-Yeah, I guess.
-Thanks.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.252
-PORSHA: You okay, babe?
-Any more coffee

04:45.285 --> 04:47.087
and I'm never gonna sleep again.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.323
I-I don't know
what you're looking for.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.124
-But I think we got this, my
brother. -That's not your call,

04:51.158 --> 04:53.627
my brother. I need you
to keep your head in the game

04:53.661 --> 04:56.263
-till I tell you we got it,
all right? -Hold on.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.432
-My head is in the game. -Yeah,
Eddie, that's not really fair--

04:58.466 --> 05:01.168
-we've been here all night.
-Yeah, he's doing his best,

05:01.201 --> 05:03.504
-and I'm tired. -Are you sure
your head's in the game?

05:03.537 --> 05:04.672
'Cause I don't think you're
hearing anything that's going on

05:04.705 --> 05:06.340
-right now.
-Yes, it is in the game.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.975
Why don't you play it back?
I'm ready...

05:08.008 --> 05:09.209
-Are you serious, man?
-Hey, hey, guys, guys.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.879
Guys. My voice is pretty shot.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.547
I could really use a rest.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.486
How about
we take a little break?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.187
-All right.
-Cool. Thanks.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.322
Okay.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.892
-Let's take 15, okay?
-We need more than 15.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.827
We need to go to bed.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.229
Calvin.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.499
You need to talk
to Cookie, Porsha.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.067
-About what?
-About Eddie.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.569
I mean, you saw him in there.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.970
He's pushing us way too hard.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.473
(scoffs)
That's his job, right?

05:39.507 --> 05:42.142
And don't he kind of remind you
of Lucious, in a way?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.310
Lucious is a perfectionist,
but at least

05:43.343 --> 05:45.045
he treats us like family.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.648
We all respect Eddie,
but we don't know him like that.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.017
He's cracking the whip
like we're picking cotton.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.420
And this has been going on
for weeks, Porsha.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.754
And it's on Cookie, too.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.556
The way she treats you.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.025
You need to stand up
for yourself.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.263
Boy, what is wrong
with you, huh?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.232
Didn't we tell you to stay away
from those people?

06:05.265 --> 06:08.335
I don't care about those people.
I was looking out for Bella.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.170
ANDRE: That distinction
won't matter to the courts.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.572
We already filed
for an appeal, but your

06:11.605 --> 06:13.340
stalking her's
gonna get it tossed out.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.342
I wasn't stalking.
I'm her father, not Angelo.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.111
Ain't nobody been saying
Angelo was her father, Hakeem.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.447
-HAKEEM: This ain't my fault.
-COOKIE: Oh,

06:19.480 --> 06:21.248
so we're gonna play
the blame game, huh?

06:21.281 --> 06:22.516
Well, maybe you
shouldn't have been having

06:22.550 --> 06:24.885
secret playdates
with dirty Diana Dubois,

06:24.918 --> 06:27.755
-running down this family.
-Okay, Ma, name one thing I said

06:27.788 --> 06:30.123
about this dysfunctional-ass
family that wasn't true.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.925
You need to take that bass
out your voice,

06:31.959 --> 06:34.595
or Bella won't have a daddy
to come home to.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.765
So, what we doing?

06:37.798 --> 06:39.967
Lucious is handling it.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.702
-Lucious?
-ANDRE: Ma, don't you think

06:41.735 --> 06:43.370
-that's a little risky?
-Look, his doctor

06:43.403 --> 06:47.307
said that he has to
continue his rehab, but...

06:47.340 --> 06:51.111
Lucious is back.
You saw that in court.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.581
Right? So show some respect.
Let him handle it.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.827
Bella's not here.
She's with my parents.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.962
And you have no visitation
rights, if I remember correctly,

07:08.996 --> 07:11.064
so unless you want me
to get a restraining order...

07:11.098 --> 07:13.801
I didn't come to see Bella,
I came to talk to you.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.836
Can I come in, please?

07:18.939 --> 07:21.542
I said please.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.622
Do you mind if I sit down?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.657
Apparently, you're going to.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.429
Angelo's gonna
be here any moment,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.131
so, please, make this quick.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.299
Do you know I lost my memory

07:46.333 --> 07:48.201
after the accident?

07:48.235 --> 07:51.772
Oh, you're...
calling it an accident?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.140
But I'm starting

07:53.173 --> 07:55.843
to get a lot of it back.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.178
Do you know what I remember?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.180
I remember you.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.016
I remember how badly
you wanted your daughter

08:03.050 --> 08:05.953
to be the only heir
to the Lyon throne.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.821
My throne.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.057
I don't know what
you're insinuating, Lucious.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.126
Oh, I'm not
insinuating anything.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.496
I'm here to offer you something.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.566
Agree to share custody,

08:18.599 --> 08:22.570
and I will make Bella
joint heir with the boys.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.006
It'll make her
a very rich woman.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.041
(chuckles)

08:28.075 --> 08:29.509
You'd put that in writing?

08:29.543 --> 08:31.078
Just as soon as you sign

08:31.111 --> 08:34.014
the co-parenting agreement.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.818
I'll think about it.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.519
While you're thinking about it,

08:39.553 --> 08:42.222
as a show of good faith,
Hakeem and the rest of us

08:42.255 --> 08:43.857
wants to see Bella.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.497
I'll agree to a family visit.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.533
One-time thing
in a public place.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.939
(door closes)

08:58.972 --> 09:00.240
(sighs)

09:02.309 --> 09:04.377
Cookie, you got
a minute to talk?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.747
Uh, when aren't you
ever talking?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.749
Look, there's this
kind of rebellion brewing--

09:08.782 --> 09:10.183
the engineers talking
about going on strike

09:10.217 --> 09:12.519
-a-and they g-g...
-Wait, wait, strike?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.854
-Yes.
-Yeah, hey, Porsha.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.689
Hey, I took care of that, um,

09:15.723 --> 09:16.757
Anika thing.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.425
Oh. Uh, thanks, Porsha.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.061
-But, Cookie, it...
-I said thank you.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.730
Don't you see me
talking to Lucious?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.569
The engineers
are talking about striking.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.304
Yeah, I know.
I talked to Eddie.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.608
I gave him my proxy
to go and handle the matter.

09:34.642 --> 09:38.411
You gave him your proxy?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.447
Last I checked,
I was running this company.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.550
Yeah, no, I figured
you got so much responsibility,

09:43.583 --> 09:47.120
you didn't have time to deal
with disgruntled engineers.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.623
I got your back, Cook,
like always.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.894
I thought your memory
was coming back.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.428
What are you talking about?

09:55.462 --> 09:59.633
Like you've "always"
been there for me?

09:59.667 --> 10:02.636
-(indistinct conversations)
-(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

10:02.670 --> 10:04.905
WOMAN:
Oh, they're coming around, baby.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.307
(Chyna chuckles)

10:07.340 --> 10:09.076
-Here you go.
-Just give me my mail.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.244
Yo, you get any mail?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.746
-No, I'm still waiting.
-Check it out.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.682
My nephew got
all dressed up and-and

10:14.715 --> 10:17.284
camped out for that new Phantom
Star Wars movie or whatever.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.687
Isn't he the cutest thing?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.188
Yeah, he is cute.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.356
Holloway, here you go.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.793
-Thanks. (whoops softly)
-What is it?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.494
I don't know, girl.
Let me see.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.369
What?

10:38.005 --> 10:40.007
It's from Lucious.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.510
He's divorcing me.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.817
Lucious...

10:49.850 --> 10:52.552
you haven't always
been there for me.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.522
Okay, if I wasn't there,
I-I will be there in the future.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.392
You look like you're getting
mighty comfortable

10:59.426 --> 11:00.728
in my seat, baby.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.132
Old Lucious might be
rattling around in there.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.400
-Mm-hmm.
-Hmm.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.704
(scoffs)

11:10.738 --> 11:13.907
* Would you ever
ride a wave with me? *

11:17.745 --> 11:21.114
* Would you ever
take a chance with me? *

11:25.618 --> 11:27.921
* Would you ever
take a leap with me? *

11:27.955 --> 11:30.590
Hey, I could never
do this with Hakeem.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.326
-Thank you. -Ain't no way
in hell. Ever. (laughs)

11:33.360 --> 11:36.229
* Would you ever change
the frequency? *

11:40.868 --> 11:43.703
* Would you ever? *

11:44.738 --> 11:45.906
* Would you ever? *

11:45.939 --> 11:47.507
Why the hell your eyes
so damn big?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.243
Don't act like
you wasn't also looking.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.411
-I was looking at Chicken.
-Right.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.213
You're looking like

11:53.246 --> 11:54.848
-you want to do more than just
look. -Yeah, I was thinking

11:54.882 --> 11:56.283
maybe we should take him home.
(laughs)

11:56.316 --> 11:58.185
Oh, word?
That's what we're doing now--

11:58.218 --> 12:00.620
we-we're just gonna cop
a big old threesome?

12:00.653 --> 12:02.389
Don't act like
you ain't never tried it.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.092
I have had every single
opportunity imaginable.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.094
Yes, because you are

12:07.127 --> 12:08.962
-Jamal Lyon.
-Thank you.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.697
-I understand.
-Yes, thank you.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.933
-Mm-mmm, thank you. Thank you.
-It's true.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.268
Nah, but it's just...
it's not for me, you know?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.104
I mean, you good with that?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.806
-You-you gonna be all right?
-I'm fine.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.307
I'm just saying,
if it's something that you

12:20.340 --> 12:21.909
haven't tried,
I haven't tried it...

12:21.942 --> 12:23.977
maybe it's something
we could try together.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.979
Let's try a threesome.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.816
You do realize that
that's, like, textbook 101 ho.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.785
And furthermore,
if we do try it,

12:31.819 --> 12:33.921
-it ain't gonna be with Opie
over there. -(laughs)

12:33.954 --> 12:35.956
WARREN:
Why not?

12:35.989 --> 12:38.125
Picking up a bartender
at the club--

12:38.158 --> 12:39.492
you know how cliché that is?

12:40.693 --> 12:42.562
All right, that's fair.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.631
* Would you ever take
a leap with me? *

12:58.611 --> 13:00.613
(exhales)

13:03.283 --> 13:05.285
(dialing)

13:07.654 --> 13:09.289
PAMELA: You've reached
Detective Pamela Rose

13:09.322 --> 13:10.858
of the New York City
Police Department.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.193
Pamela, it's Andre.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.996
I'm sorry for leaving you
a hundred voice messages, but...

13:16.029 --> 13:17.797
(sighs)

13:17.831 --> 13:19.867
You haven't called me back,
so I'm a little worried.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.702
I owe you an apology for
the fight we had the other day,

13:22.735 --> 13:25.505
and, um, let's
talk about it, okay?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.540
Over dinner?
My treat.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.912
I miss you, call me back.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.621
REPORTER: We're getting
new information right now

13:41.654 --> 13:44.524
from the newsroom. We have
breaking news out of Brooklyn,

13:44.557 --> 13:47.861
where there's been
an officer-involved shooting.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.198
The condition of
the NYPD detective and at least

13:51.231 --> 13:53.867
one suspect are unknown
at this time.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.836
We can confirm
that the officer involved

13:56.870 --> 13:59.206
is NYPD Detective Pamela Rose.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.707
-PORSHA: Andre. -A police
spokesperson confirms reports

14:00.740 --> 14:02.509
-that Detective Rose...
-You got a second?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.311
This thing with the engineers
is about to get crazy.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.645
I saw Calvin trying
to e-mail the union...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.680
Uh, not-not-not now,
Porsha, okay?

14:07.714 --> 14:11.318
Just, um,
tell Cookie I-I had to go.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.886
-What?
-Tell her I had to go.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.422
*

14:25.432 --> 14:28.201
Calvin, what is this?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.237
If you and the other engineers
think you're gonna start off

14:30.270 --> 14:32.239
some kind of rebellion,
it's not gonna end well.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.506
You need to call this off
right now.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.275
Uh, what's going on?

14:35.308 --> 14:38.845
Look, Cookie, those signs
weren't supposed to get out yet.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.848
But all the sound engineers
and studio musicians agree--

14:41.881 --> 14:44.384
the long hours,
the short turnaround times,

14:44.417 --> 14:46.119
working weekends and holidays--

14:46.153 --> 14:47.587
-it's got to stop.
-I understand,

14:47.620 --> 14:49.389
Calvin, I really do,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.591
but I need you to bear with me.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.893
Just-just until we get through
this 20 For 20.

14:53.927 --> 14:57.097
The union
pre-authorized a strike.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.933
All I got to do
is send this e-mail...

14:59.967 --> 15:01.101
and we walk.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.602
-What'd he say?
-Strike.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.905
Lucious told me
you were handling this.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.540
Oh, I am. Believe me.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.442
Boy.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.811
Did you just threaten the woman
who signs your paychecks?

15:11.844 --> 15:13.113
I ain't your boy.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.317
Is this the e-mail
you talking about?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.920
-Eddie, don't... (sighs)
-You want to strike?

15:20.954 --> 15:24.324
Strike. It's not gonna
end well for you.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.593
-You're good to these people,
Cookie. -I am.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.561
Okay.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.896
EDDIE:
So don't cave to them.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.999
Let's go, Porsha.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.301
CALVIN:
Porsha, what did we talk about?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.476
Oh, I see how it is.
This is new.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.180
So your man says, "Jump,"
and you say, "How high?"

15:47.214 --> 15:48.215
(crowd murmuring)

15:49.949 --> 15:51.451
(scoffs)

15:51.484 --> 15:54.287
My man's not the one
I wake up for at 4:30 a.m.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.489
and don't go to sleep for until
she's asleep, and in between,

15:56.523 --> 15:58.291
waiting on her hand and foot
all damn day.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.627
All right, Porsha, we're not
gonna do this right now.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.095
Nah, you're not talking
over me this time.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.663
I let you call me out my name

16:03.696 --> 16:05.265
'cause I know it's not true,
but lately

16:05.298 --> 16:07.467
I feel like maybe I am stupid.
I let my job

16:07.500 --> 16:09.702
become my life without
even getting a thank you.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.638
This ain't about me and Calvin.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.840
It's about me and you, Cookie.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.943
I know y'all tired
of Empire treating us like

16:16.976 --> 16:18.478
we're not the ones
making it happen.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.347
-WOMAN: Yeah, Porsha.
-MAN: We're with you.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.816
Empire don't work without us.
So we deserve some damn respect.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.718
(crowd murmuring)

16:25.752 --> 16:27.954
-WOMAN: Let's do this. Let's go.
-Strike!

16:27.987 --> 16:30.057
Strike! Strike!

16:30.090 --> 16:32.359
Strike!

16:33.426 --> 16:35.662
Come on, Calvin.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.066
Strike! Strike!

16:39.099 --> 16:40.767
-Strike!
-(scoffs)

16:44.404 --> 16:46.506
He looks even hotter in person

16:46.539 --> 16:48.341
than he does
on his pictures, right, Jamal?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.043
Yeah, man,
you look like you work out.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.713
Y'all want some grapes
or oranges or whatever?

16:53.746 --> 16:55.715
Usually there's nothing
but trolls on that app,

16:55.748 --> 16:56.916
but, uh, I really lucked out.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.418
Yeah, you sure did.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.520
Look at him, Jamal.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.489
Mmm.
All right, man.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.057
-Let's open this up.
-Yeah.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.696
Yo, yo, yo, what's up,
is everything all right?

17:09.729 --> 17:11.364
Uh, just hold on, all right?

17:13.766 --> 17:15.435
Yo, what's the problem?
I thought

17:15.468 --> 17:17.370
-you was down with this.
-No, you didn't. You actually

17:17.404 --> 17:19.539
-knew that I wasn't down
with that. -Come on, Jamal.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.174
-He's here and he's hot as hell,
so we should... -Yeah, okay,

17:21.208 --> 17:23.210
well, whatever. I only
entertained this foolishness

17:23.243 --> 17:24.577
because I love you.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.279
Maybe if I didn't care
about you,

17:26.313 --> 17:27.780
then it would be easier for me,

17:27.814 --> 17:29.616
but you wanted it, I didn't.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.426
Come here.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.928
Look, man, this is not gonna
work out. You got to go.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.330
Are you kidding?
Why?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.032
You see that guy over there?

17:46.065 --> 17:49.102
-Yeah?
-I'm in love with him.

17:49.136 --> 17:52.472
And I probably don't even
deserve him at this point.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.774
But I got to try to fix
what I messed up.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.409
So, no hard feelings, but you...

17:56.443 --> 17:57.744
-Right on.
-Just head out, all right?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.483
Yo, man, thank you for coming.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.655
(elevator bell dings)

18:08.688 --> 18:10.557
What?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.325
-You know, you're right.
-I know I'm right.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.594
No, you have no idea.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.096
Look, there...

18:17.130 --> 18:19.966
there's something
that I need to tell you.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.136
Listen, no matter what happens
from here on out,

18:23.170 --> 18:26.573
no matter who says what,

18:26.606 --> 18:28.408
just remember that I love you.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.744
-I know you do, and I...
-No, listen to me.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.813
I need you to know
that this is real.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.748
That I love you.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.750
I love you, too.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.186
I really do.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.653
All right, come here.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.168
(exclaims)

18:57.237 --> 18:58.838
(knocking)

19:01.674 --> 19:03.176
I've been freaking out.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.878
-Looks like it.
-What happened? Are you okay?

19:05.912 --> 19:08.181
-I'm starving. Let's get
something to eat. -Hey,

19:08.215 --> 19:10.350
whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, look.
Look, I texted you a million

19:10.383 --> 19:12.652
times, been to every hospital
between here and Coney Island,

19:12.685 --> 19:14.521
thinking you were dead,
and that's all you have

19:14.554 --> 19:15.888
to say to me-- "Let's-let's
get something to eat"?

19:15.922 --> 19:17.123
I don't want to talk about it.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.192
Sit down.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.362
-(grunts)
-It's okay.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.396
Sit down.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.432
(sighs)

19:28.501 --> 19:31.003
Okay.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.772
Cards are on the table.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.410
I know you don't trust me.

19:37.444 --> 19:41.381
And that's why
you've been holding back.

19:41.414 --> 19:44.116
But listen,
when I thought that you...

19:47.019 --> 19:49.522
It made me realize
I don't want to lose you.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.500
The guy threw shots at me.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.336
I shot back.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.937
He went for his gun,

20:04.971 --> 20:06.606
and it was him or me.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.578
I shot him.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.213
I killed him.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.048
You didn't have a choice.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.251
That's what I told I.A.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.589
The truth is...

20:24.657 --> 20:27.927
...I planted that gun to make
the shoot look justified.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.398
It was wrong.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.400
And I'm gonna get away with it.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.637
Now you know something about me

20:37.670 --> 20:40.172
that could put me in a cell
for the rest of my life.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.076
Do you still believe
I don't trust you?

20:52.151 --> 20:54.153
(instruments warming up)

21:00.593 --> 21:02.028
Hey, everyone.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.931
I've been writing a symphony.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.132
(phones buzzing and whooshing)

21:06.165 --> 21:07.834
The painting is my music.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.603
It's gonna be my masterwork.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.674
Here, the color's green,
we're gonna

21:14.707 --> 21:15.842
use F-shar...

21:15.875 --> 21:18.110
(door opens)

21:22.048 --> 21:23.416
Where's everybody going?

21:23.450 --> 21:24.651
On strike.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.218
I'm really sorry, Lucious.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.673
This is a damn mess.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.875
Can't do nothing
without my musicians.

21:52.579 --> 21:57.216
Only other cat who could paint
like that and make music...

21:57.249 --> 22:00.353
was Miles.

22:00.387 --> 22:04.391
I can't make a whole symphony
by myself.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.559
Labor disputes happen
at all companies

22:06.593 --> 22:08.327
sooner or later.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.129
It's just a hiccup.
They'll be back.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.599
But the main thing is that
you're feeling that you're back.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.969
I am.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.805
That's good news.

22:18.838 --> 22:22.208
Back in the day,
you'd be writing a song

22:22.241 --> 22:25.678
on that keyboard of yours.
(chuckles)

22:25.712 --> 22:27.146
Old keyboard.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.916
And I'd come back the next day,

22:29.949 --> 22:32.318
and you'd be in the same spot,

22:32.351 --> 22:34.053
wouldn't have moved.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.988
You're a beast.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.590
The only musician that you need

22:37.624 --> 22:39.959
is sitting behind that piano
right now.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.363
Or else you're not Lucious Lyon.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.745
LUCIOUS:
Two, three, four...

22:58.778 --> 23:01.614
*

23:04.283 --> 23:06.285
I am a beast.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.320
*

23:19.832 --> 23:22.401
Question is:
is it in your head,

23:22.435 --> 23:24.471
or is it in your heart?

23:24.504 --> 23:27.139
*

23:46.192 --> 23:48.260
*

23:52.632 --> 23:54.333
I am Lucious Lyon.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.607
(cheering and applause)

24:00.640 --> 24:03.175
Look, I know you guys tired
of Empire treating us

24:03.209 --> 24:05.177
like we're not the ones
putting in the work.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.313
-(cheering)
-Fired up, won't take no more!

24:07.346 --> 24:09.415
-Fired up!
-CROWD: Won't take no more!

24:09.448 --> 24:11.851
-Fired up!
-Won't take no more!

24:11.884 --> 24:13.920
-Fired up! -Won't take no more!

24:13.953 --> 24:15.622
-Fired up!
-Won't take no more!

24:15.655 --> 24:18.024
-Fired up! -Won't take no more!

24:18.057 --> 24:19.191
-Fired up!
-Won't take no more!

24:19.225 --> 24:21.928
-Uh, Shine?
-Yeah.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.796
-What the hell are you doing?
-What's it look like?

24:23.830 --> 24:26.332
I'm rolling with the 99%.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.267
You do realize you own
a percentage of the company?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.335
(chuckles)
Yeah.

24:29.368 --> 24:30.603
It don't matter.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.338
My mother worked
in the school lunchroom.

24:32.371 --> 24:33.472
I got union blood.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.876
-Let's move.
-PORSHA: Fired up!

24:36.909 --> 24:38.110
-You got dumb blood.
-Fired up!

24:38.144 --> 24:39.478
CROWD:
Won't take no more!

24:39.512 --> 24:42.014
-Fired up!
-Won't take no more!

24:42.048 --> 24:43.449
-Fired up! -Won't take no more!

24:43.482 --> 24:46.018
(cheering)

24:48.154 --> 24:50.156
-What's our wages?
-Empire wages!

24:50.189 --> 24:52.058
-What's our wages?
-Empire wages!

24:52.091 --> 24:54.093
(cheers and applause)

24:59.098 --> 25:01.033
Give it up for Porsha!

25:01.067 --> 25:03.169
(cheers and applause)

25:03.202 --> 25:05.137
Y'all know me, I'm Tory Ash.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.374
And it's no secret
that I've made some mistakes.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.643
But knowing who to be loyal to
was never one of them.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.411
(cheering)

25:12.444 --> 25:15.381
Now, the Man wants me to sing
at Laviticus tonight.

25:15.414 --> 25:18.384
(jeering)

25:18.417 --> 25:19.986
But I'm not gonna sing
for the Man.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.521
I'm gonna sing for the people!

25:22.555 --> 25:23.890
(cheering)

25:23.923 --> 25:25.424
* From the dawn of creation *

25:25.457 --> 25:26.659
Oh, great, the song.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.195
* From the dust of the womb *

25:29.228 --> 25:31.230
* From the bowels
of the matrix *

25:31.263 --> 25:33.265
* We will rise like the Louvre *

25:33.299 --> 25:36.502
* Camera flashes
and torchlights *

25:36.535 --> 25:39.271
* Ceremonial hues *

25:39.305 --> 25:42.008
* We will put all we have
on the line *

25:42.041 --> 25:44.744
-* Every day we could lose, so *
-Yeah!

25:44.777 --> 25:47.279
* So don't bring me
no bad news *

25:47.313 --> 25:49.381
* No, no, no, no bad news *

25:49.415 --> 25:51.851
* Don't you bring me
no bad news *

25:51.884 --> 25:54.687
* No, no bad news,
when it's all too much *

25:54.721 --> 25:56.288
* Enough is enough *

25:56.322 --> 25:59.091
* Build a wall,
and we will climb up *

25:59.125 --> 26:02.061
* It's dedication, one nation *

26:02.094 --> 26:04.263
-Tory! -* Feel the fire,
we light it all up *

26:04.296 --> 26:06.966
* Push us higher,
where we belong *

26:06.999 --> 26:10.302
* Every voice,
it's a revolution *

26:10.336 --> 26:12.204
* It's a revolution *

26:12.238 --> 26:15.441
* It's
a revolution *

26:15.474 --> 26:17.343
* So we light it all up. *

26:19.578 --> 26:21.714
-What's disgusting?
-CROWD: Union busting!

26:21.748 --> 26:23.616
-What's disgusting?
-Union busting!

26:23.650 --> 26:24.917
-What's disgusting? -Union
busting!

26:24.951 --> 26:27.086
You hear them out there?
They hate me.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.487
They don't hate you, Cook.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.922
You can't let 'em get to you.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.390
Look, we talked this over
with Lucious.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.959
We got a plan.
First off,

26:32.992 --> 26:34.426
we got a bus pulling
into the rear loading dock

26:34.460 --> 26:36.495
-full of engineers.
-Uh-uh. Wait a minute.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.064
-Are you talking about scabs?
-Replacements.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.932
It's just temporary.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.400
But we got to show them
that we're not gonna take

26:41.433 --> 26:43.335
this kind of nonsense--
we got work to do.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.772
Yeah. Meanwhile, back at the
ranch, I got my people out there

26:45.805 --> 26:47.139
collecting dirt on all
the strike leaders.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.441
They're a skeevy bunch,
especially that Calvin.

26:49.475 --> 26:51.077
-No, no, no, we're not
doing that. -Why not?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.179
-Why not? -Because those people
are like family to me.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.249
-What about 20 For 20?
-What about it?

26:57.283 --> 26:58.417
You staked everything
on delivering that,

26:58.450 --> 26:59.986
and now they're derailing it.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.788
If they were family,
they wouldn't be doing that.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.790
That's because right now,
they think we're the enemy.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.992
So it is up to us to show them
that we have more in common

27:06.025 --> 27:07.860
than what separates us.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.800
WOMEN:
Ta-da!

27:13.833 --> 27:15.434
WOMAN:
Happy Divorce Day!

27:15.467 --> 27:19.338
Thanks, guys.
I'm not hungry, though.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.007
Forget Lucious.
He gone.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.142
TAMARA: I mean, we all
been there, Cookie.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.977
I was only here a month
before my old man

27:25.011 --> 27:26.713
dropped divorce papers on me.

27:26.746 --> 27:29.215
Damn. A bitch can't even
be invited

27:29.248 --> 27:30.482
to your little pity party.

27:30.516 --> 27:32.184
You know what, Cookie?

27:32.218 --> 27:34.887
I saw your man Lucious
whopping it up with Mary J.

27:34.921 --> 27:37.990
And he was dancing
up against Mya...

27:38.024 --> 27:39.458
Get out of here, Poundcake.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.161
And what you gonna do
about it, Loretha?

27:42.194 --> 27:43.362
No.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.331
(inmates murmuring, shushing)

27:48.534 --> 27:49.902
Are you knocked up?

27:49.936 --> 27:51.938
You don't know what the hell
you talking about, bitch.

27:57.443 --> 28:01.080
Look, Cookie, I've dealt with
a lot of work uncertainties,

28:01.113 --> 28:02.915
and y-you got to trust me
on this one.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.584
What's your title again, Eddie?

28:05.617 --> 28:07.253
(clicks tongue, clears throat)

28:09.088 --> 28:12.224
I'm a special advisor
to the CEO, Cookie Lyon.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.826
Right.

28:13.860 --> 28:17.764
So you, Lucious and Thirsty--
manly men

28:17.797 --> 28:20.366
running around doing
manly things.

28:20.399 --> 28:24.170
But, you see, men always
screw things up in the end.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.272
Look, get everybody
in the conference room.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.707
Try not to swing those big,
salty things around,

28:28.741 --> 28:30.910
scaring everybody.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.344
You're the boss.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.981
Yeah, she is.
I'll start upstairs.

28:59.005 --> 29:01.307
There they are, the boss men.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.209
Y'all know Lucious and Thirsty.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.944
You're getting to know Eddie.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.280
Lucious, do you remember

29:08.314 --> 29:10.316
who the people in this room are?

29:10.349 --> 29:13.119
Janet, Marsha.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.154
Calvin.

29:16.688 --> 29:17.924
You and me, we made a lot

29:17.957 --> 29:19.125
of hits together, right?

29:19.158 --> 29:20.392
Yeah.

29:20.426 --> 29:24.563
Jared, Kaela.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.566
Now, a lot of y'all have heard
that I lost my memory

29:27.599 --> 29:31.103
as a result of, uh,
an explosion with my car.

29:31.137 --> 29:34.273
I'm here to tell y'all
that I'm back.

29:36.042 --> 29:39.411
So, you remember
referring to this room

29:39.445 --> 29:40.947
as your Empire family?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.681
Yes, it's my family.

29:42.714 --> 29:46.652
And sometimes families do what?
We fight.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.454
That's right.
Sometimes we fight.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.023
There's a time for fighting
and then there's a time

29:51.057 --> 29:52.791
to pull people together.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.430
You know what,
let me tell you a story.

29:58.464 --> 30:02.101
Something that happened to me
when I was in prison.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.036
-What you gonna play? I got a...
-That's you?

30:04.070 --> 30:06.105
-How many is that?
-15. Count it up.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.639
-See, you cheating. -Yo,
can y'all get me some water?

30:07.673 --> 30:09.041
Okay.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.509
(laughter)

30:10.542 --> 30:13.612
(groaning)

30:13.645 --> 30:15.314
There's something wrong
with the baby.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.016
Then go to the infirmary, bitch.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.885
No, no, no, I can't, because
if I go to the infirmary,

30:18.918 --> 30:20.853
they're gonna make me have
an abortion.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.354
Serves you right for getting
knocked up by a guard.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.390
(groaning)

30:24.423 --> 30:25.958
I'll go call the C.O. on watch.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.559
No, no, no, Chyna.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.695
It's okay, Poundcake,
we got you.

30:29.728 --> 30:32.231
Why are you defending
this bitch?

30:32.264 --> 30:34.400
Because I got three sons
on the outside I'm living for.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.836
But in here, we're
the only family we got, so...

30:37.870 --> 30:39.571
-Can you walk?
-Yeah, I think so.

30:39.605 --> 30:40.572
Come on.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.308
Mm.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.876
Come on, here.

30:49.015 --> 30:50.917
LUCIOUS:
Wait, wait, hold on.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.319
This is the same chick
that cut you

30:53.352 --> 30:55.888
that you're now calling
your friend?

30:55.922 --> 30:57.556
No, not friend.
(chuckles)

30:57.589 --> 31:00.092
I mean, none of us got along,
really-- it's prison.

31:00.126 --> 31:03.595
But we realized
that on the inside,

31:03.629 --> 31:05.231
all we had was each other.

31:05.264 --> 31:07.699
-(Poundcake groaning)
-COOKIE: Shh...

31:07.733 --> 31:11.570
Calm down.
Oh, you are burning up.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.105
No doctor.

31:13.139 --> 31:14.273
I know, but keep it down.
Keep it down.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.345
We gonna get through this.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.013
You gonna have that baby,
don't you worry.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.614
Mm.

31:22.648 --> 31:26.585
I remember when my first
was born.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.287
It was snowing like crazy.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.524
One of those "once in a decade"
kind of blizzards.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.793
(Cookie chuckles)

31:34.826 --> 31:37.463
And all the plows got sent
to Center City

31:37.496 --> 31:39.966
while the black folks
in North Philly

31:39.999 --> 31:41.700
had to plow their own asses out.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.602
(chuckles)

31:43.635 --> 31:46.072
There was snow everywhere.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.207
I was so scared.

31:48.240 --> 31:52.211
I didn't have a mama,
didn't have a daddy.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.246
And that's the night
my water broke.

31:55.948 --> 31:59.218
Lucious had an old hooptie
with one windshield wiper

31:59.251 --> 32:02.488
and bald tires. (chuckles)

32:02.521 --> 32:05.124
Man, those streets
were so deserted.

32:05.157 --> 32:09.095
And we was trying our best to
make it to that hospital, boy.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.097
Don't you know,
that damn hooptie broke down

32:11.130 --> 32:12.631
right on Girard Avenue.

32:12.664 --> 32:15.134
Wait, don't tell me
you had no baby in no car.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.768
Oh, no, girl.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.737
Let me...
let me finish the story.

32:18.770 --> 32:23.242
So, there was this white Lincoln
that appeared out of nowhere.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.245
It was like a angel
dropping from the sky.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.613
And guess what he said
to Lucious.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.348
What?

32:29.381 --> 32:32.151
"I caught your set
at the Grape Room,

32:32.184 --> 32:33.685
and your lyrics is dope."

32:33.719 --> 32:35.687
-What?
-Girl, next thing I know,

32:35.721 --> 32:37.456
we pulling up
to the emergency room

32:37.489 --> 32:39.691
in a white Lincoln.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.794
And that driver was bumping
Lucious' latest banger.

32:42.828 --> 32:45.464
(chuckles)

32:47.499 --> 32:50.336
15 minutes later,

32:50.369 --> 32:53.905
Andre Martin Lyon was born.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.809
(keys jangling)

33:07.586 --> 33:09.788
Under those circumstances,

33:09.821 --> 33:12.491
we had to be family.

33:12.524 --> 33:16.228
And under the circumstances
of this company,

33:16.262 --> 33:18.297
you all are our family.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.999
And I just wanted
to remind you of that.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.635
Jared, when your mother
became sick,

33:23.669 --> 33:26.905
who gave you three weeks'
paid leave?

33:26.938 --> 33:29.175
You did, Cookie.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.876
Mm-hmm.

33:30.909 --> 33:34.413
And, Kaela, when you
lost your voice, what happened?

33:34.446 --> 33:37.083
Empire paid for me to get rehab.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.851
That's right,
and that was all Lucious.

33:39.885 --> 33:43.122
Jordan, who paid
for your children's tuition?

33:44.590 --> 33:45.857
Hmm.

33:45.891 --> 33:50.662
Now, Empire may not follow
every union rule,

33:50.696 --> 33:54.400
but when you are in need, we
are there for you like a family.

33:56.268 --> 34:00.139
So I'm asking that you
be there for Empire.

34:02.141 --> 34:06.445
Porsha, I hope you know
I don't mean to call you stupid.

34:06.478 --> 34:07.779
That's just the way I talk.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.849
I think you're very intelligent.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.419
If I didn't think that,
you wouldn't have the job.

34:15.287 --> 34:18.357
Now, can you tell your man
to lay off?

34:18.390 --> 34:20.426
We good, babe?

34:20.459 --> 34:21.827
Do you trust her?

34:24.963 --> 34:26.698
I think we got this.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.867
So the strike's settled?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.537
Yeah, we're good.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.339
(applause)

34:39.945 --> 34:41.947
(sighs)

34:47.853 --> 34:49.788
-What?
-I-I know you saw me

34:49.821 --> 34:52.324
out there when Tory Ash
was singing,

34:52.358 --> 34:55.127
and I was hyping up the crowd
and everything.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.229
I saw you acting a fool.

34:57.263 --> 35:01.633
Look, don't think I settled this
strike because of you, Porsha.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.769
But you did good.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.338
-Cookie, I waited three years
to hear you say that. -Ah.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.006
(chuckles)
And you gonna wait another ten

35:08.039 --> 35:09.975
before you hear it again.
Get off me, girl!

35:10.008 --> 35:12.211
Look, fix this. It's broke.

35:14.012 --> 35:17.149
Cookie, you had the ringer off.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.117
Uh, like I said, it's broke.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.319
Get out, Porsha.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.488
Thank you.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.331
ANDRE:
Mmm.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.769
I think it's time.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.438
Time for what?

35:39.471 --> 35:42.941
Time for you to meet my family.

35:42.974 --> 35:47.145
Mm... (laughs)

35:47.179 --> 35:49.281
What's so funny?

35:49.315 --> 35:51.783
How will we tell them we met?

35:51.817 --> 35:56.121
Will we tell them about your
little equipment failure?

35:56.154 --> 35:59.325
(laughs)
It's working just fine now.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.659
-Mmm, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.728
(phone buzzes)

36:07.833 --> 36:09.034
Damn.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.339
My family's going
to see my niece.

36:13.372 --> 36:17.075
Leaving me here alone?

36:17.108 --> 36:19.044
(chuckles)

36:19.077 --> 36:20.412
Tell you what.

36:22.414 --> 36:25.384
Next time...

36:25.417 --> 36:27.253
you'll go...

36:27.286 --> 36:28.820
with me.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.256
(giggles)

36:30.289 --> 36:31.390
-Okay?
-Okay.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.259
-Deal?
-Yep.

36:33.292 --> 36:36.362
All right. I'll see you.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.902
LUCIOUS:
Here's Dre. Let's do this.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.371
Hey, guys.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.705
-JAMAL: Hey.
-COOKIE: Thanks for helping me

36:46.738 --> 36:47.839
settle the strike.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.040
ANDRE:
Look, I'm sorry, Ma.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.409
I had a little emergency,
that's all.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.177
Uh-huh. I know
what that looks like.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.612
-ANDRE: Mm-hmm. -JAMAL: You
take care of that emergency?

36:53.645 --> 36:54.780
-(Andre laughs)
-JAMAL: You looking good.

36:54.813 --> 36:55.947
It takes one to know one.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.549
I'm about to have Warren
move in with me.

36:57.583 --> 37:00.452
Uh, if I was you,
I'd slow my roll.

37:00.486 --> 37:01.787
You don't even know that boy.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.555
Ma, could you just be happy?

37:03.589 --> 37:05.391
'Cause I am.
This is huge for me.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.058
I really think he's my one.

37:07.092 --> 37:08.927
I... wouldn't say that so soon.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.962
Dad, can you please
tell your girl?

37:10.996 --> 37:12.531
He's been there for me
every single step of the way.

37:12.564 --> 37:14.099
He's been there for you, too.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.934
Mm, I've met him. I like him.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.370
Uh, I wish I could spend
a little more time with him.

37:18.404 --> 37:21.273
Well, we all will get
plenty more chances

37:21.307 --> 37:22.408
'cause he's joining the family.

37:22.441 --> 37:23.575
LUCIOUS:
Oh, really?

37:23.609 --> 37:24.576
Family of the new

37:24.610 --> 37:26.545
and improved
Lucious Lyon, right?

37:26.578 --> 37:28.880
(laughs)

37:28.914 --> 37:30.482
Well, I guess I'm supposed
to be happy for you.

37:30.516 --> 37:31.950
Yes, Mom, you are.

37:31.983 --> 37:34.085
-Come on, girl, bring it in.
-LUCIOUS: Don't she look happy?

37:34.119 --> 37:36.388
Seriously,
both of y'all booed up?

37:36.422 --> 37:38.924
LUCIOUS: Andre, when are we
gonna meet your woman?

37:38.957 --> 37:41.460
Um, I was just... I was making
sure that it was real--

37:41.493 --> 37:43.929
that's all--
before I said anything.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.097
Or before your wild-ass family
scared her away.

37:46.131 --> 37:47.799
That's right, 'cause you would.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.067
Let's go get our baby.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.436
HAKEEM:
We're really gonna do this?

37:50.469 --> 37:51.937
LUCIOUS:
Damn right, we are.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.872
-JAMAL: Will y'all act right?
-ANDRE: Yeah.

37:55.341 --> 37:59.445
(elegant classical music
playing)

38:00.779 --> 38:03.114
So the threesome didn't happen.

38:03.148 --> 38:05.951
I thought you said you could
get Jamal to do anything.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.586
It had nothing to do with him.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.154
I couldn't
go through with that.

38:09.187 --> 38:11.022
Really?

38:11.056 --> 38:13.124
Look, I'm out.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.160
(chuckles)
You fell in love with him.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.796
What is it about these Lyons?

38:17.829 --> 38:20.499
Must be pheromones, hmm?

38:20.532 --> 38:22.368
It was the last thing that
I expected to happen, but...

38:22.401 --> 38:24.269
Oh, I expected it.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.338
-Excuse me?
-(chuckles)

38:26.372 --> 38:28.306
Yes, that's why
I asked Anika to step in,

38:28.340 --> 38:30.141
because she's really committed

38:30.175 --> 38:32.378
to helping me
take down the Lyon cubs.

38:32.411 --> 38:35.714
-It's not about...
-And look who comes.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.516
WARREN: What the hell
are they doing here?

38:37.549 --> 38:41.853
Oh, the entire Lyon clan.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.789
-Welcome, everyone.
-HAKEEM: Where's Anika?

38:43.822 --> 38:45.056
Welcome.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.158
Where's Bella?

38:47.192 --> 38:49.060
Warren, what are you doing here?

38:54.099 --> 38:56.234
Cookie, do you want to tell
your family what's happening?

38:56.267 --> 38:58.236
So, I guess this is a setup.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.338
Yes, it is.

39:00.372 --> 39:03.208
And my nephew Warren
can provide full details.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.043
Your nephew?

39:10.215 --> 39:14.019
Jamal, I was gonna tell you.
I just didn't have a chance...

39:14.052 --> 39:15.521
DIANA:
Oh, Warren, please.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.556
His job was to make you
fall in love with him.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.591
And then take pictures of you.

39:19.625 --> 39:22.861
In a ménage à trois
for the world to see.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.062
HAKEEM:
Dad, do something.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.363
COOKIE:
This is the time for fighting.

39:25.397 --> 39:26.364
LUCIOUS:
I'm back.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.566
ANDRE:
Pop, let's go.

39:27.599 --> 39:28.900
-(screams)
-LUCIOUS: I'm back.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.035
HAKEEM:
Dad, come on.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.369
LUCIOUS:
I'm back.

39:31.403 --> 39:32.738
HAKEEM:
Dad!

39:32.771 --> 39:34.706
JAMAL:
No, this is mine.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.007
Jamal, listen to me.
I was just gonna...

39:36.041 --> 39:38.209
Bitch!

39:38.243 --> 39:39.711
(guests gasping)

39:39.745 --> 39:41.947
Lying-ass bitch, huh?

39:41.980 --> 39:43.248
Ooh.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.217
-WOMAN: Oh, my God.
-JAMAL: Die!

39:46.251 --> 39:47.519
-That's enough.
-Mal!

39:47.553 --> 39:50.589
Mal, get off of him.
They're filming.

39:50.622 --> 39:53.859
JAMAL: Why?!
Now, you gonna tell me.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.861
-I want to know why. Why?!
-Come on, Mal.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.396
Huh? Huh? Huh?

39:58.430 --> 40:00.365
'Cause your bitch-ass son
got his feelings hurt? Huh?

40:00.398 --> 40:01.567
-Can't be mayor?
-HAKEEM: They filming, Mal.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.602
Huh? I don't give a damn
if they filming.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.703
Come on, film, film this.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.037
Hello! Hello.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.739
All of y'all can film,
I don't give a damn!

40:07.773 --> 40:08.874
-Come on, Mal.
-Come on!

40:08.907 --> 40:10.241
Get off, get off.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.613
We're coming for you, bitch.

40:17.483 --> 40:20.418
Put the damn cameras away!

40:20.452 --> 40:22.353
Lucious, come on, let's go!

40:32.130 --> 40:34.132
See?

40:40.772 --> 40:44.309
God, I wanted to slam his ass
on that table.

40:44.342 --> 40:47.779
And stomp his head
with my prosthetic leg.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.121
Yeah, I know.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.290
-(Cookie laughing)
-Pop, the car!

40:59.324 --> 41:00.325
What?! Wha...?

41:00.358 --> 41:01.927
LUCIOUS:
Go!

41:01.960 --> 41:03.294
Let her go.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.296
Shoot me right here.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.198
-Hey, get your ass out.
-Hey.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.903
The old Lucious
would have done that.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.487
Yeah.

Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

here are a few more shows
