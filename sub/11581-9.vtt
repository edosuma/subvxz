00:06.674 --> 00:08.642
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:08.676 --> 00:11.512
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.781
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.814 --> 00:15.649
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.683 --> 00:17.385
are members of an elite squad

00:17.418 --> 00:19.387
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.422
These are their stories.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.194
Grandpa, who
made the world?

00:26.227 --> 00:28.462
That's a tough one,
Sunshine.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.098
Why?

00:30.131 --> 00:33.234
Well, because some folks
say God made it,

00:33.267 --> 00:36.670
and others say
there was this big bang,

00:36.704 --> 00:39.240
and the world just appeared.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.441
I don't think so.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.509
Who do you think

00:41.542 --> 00:43.144
made the world?

00:43.177 --> 00:45.179
Bob the Builder.
That's his job.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.214
Help me!

00:46.247 --> 00:50.251
( yelling )

00:50.284 --> 00:52.520
Oh, my God!
Help me!

00:52.553 --> 00:57.191
( yelling )

01:05.466 --> 01:06.334
Get me his shoes.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.137
Sir, can you tell me
exactly what you saw?

01:09.170 --> 01:11.505
First he's
jabbering nonsense.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.242
Then his belly was
bleeding like a...

01:14.275 --> 01:16.110
stuck pig.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.246
Next thing I know,
boom, he falls.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.713
So, what did you do?

01:19.747 --> 01:22.150
I grabbed my
granddaughter.
I ran down.

01:22.183 --> 01:25.419
I got to him. He was
still babbling away.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.620
I called 911.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.889
Sir, could you make out
what he was saying?

01:28.922 --> 01:32.126
"It's a mistake.
It's a mistake."

01:32.160 --> 01:33.761
BENSON:
What have we got?

01:33.794 --> 01:36.297
Name of the victim
is Horace Gorman.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.831
On his way
to St. Mark's Hospital.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.400
The medics think
he'll make it.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.402
Was there any sign
of sexual assault?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.137
In a manner
of speaking.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.805
Still haven't
found the package.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.207
What package?

01:46.240 --> 01:47.074
Mr. Gorman's.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.710
His penis and testicles
were cut off.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.812
And they're still missing.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.367
I wish I could tell you,
but it happened so quickly.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.901
What's the last thing
you remember?

02:47.935 --> 02:50.804
Oh, uh, the train
doors opening,

02:50.838 --> 02:52.473
stepping out on
the platform.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.542
Then... it's all a blur.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.910
How about the people
on the train?

02:56.944 --> 02:58.846
Anyone following you,
watching you?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.415
I don't know.

03:01.449 --> 03:04.518
I keep my eyes
to myself.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.254
The man
that found you said

03:06.287 --> 03:08.889
that you kept saying,
"It's a mistake."

03:08.922 --> 03:10.391
What did you mean?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.661
I must've been delirious.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.463
Do you remember
hearing

03:15.496 --> 03:16.997
or seeing anything
when you were attacked?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.399
Last thing
I felt

03:18.432 --> 03:22.570
was something hitting
the back of my head.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.805
And then darkness.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.640
Anyone around
when you

03:26.674 --> 03:27.975
regained consciousness?

03:28.008 --> 03:30.578
There was a wild man wearing

03:30.611 --> 03:31.612
black rags.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.713
A homeless guy?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.448
Yeah. He
was screaming.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.549
Screaming what?

03:35.583 --> 03:39.553
Crazy rants about, uh...
a Judas tree.

03:39.587 --> 03:43.391
Then he ran off.

03:43.424 --> 03:46.427
I crawled toward the light,
and, uh...

03:46.460 --> 03:49.563
( sobbing ):
saw what he'd done.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.766
Oh, God.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.768
I'm not a man anymore.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.510
Maybe Mr. Gorman
didn't want to be
a man anymore.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.578
You think he wanted
his johnson hacked off?

04:04.612 --> 04:06.380
Well, Mr. Gorman's
doctor said

04:06.414 --> 04:08.416
that the blade
that severed his genitals

04:08.449 --> 04:09.783
was very sharp,
like a scalpel.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.685
He could have been
a member of some cult.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.854
In ancient Rome,
priests of the goddess Cybele

04:13.887 --> 04:16.457
would castrate themselves
to achieve divine status.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.858
How the hell
you know that?

04:17.891 --> 04:18.926
The Internet.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.430
So, either Gorman
was snipped by a homeless guy,

04:22.463 --> 04:25.666
or had a voluntary penectomy--
not a word I get to use
every day.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.435
What do we know about this guy?

04:27.468 --> 04:28.902
STABLER:
62, single
and rich.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.373
Retired at age 30.
Dabbles in historic
preservation.

04:32.406 --> 04:33.741
You know how he
made his fortune?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.509
He invented the
games you find

04:35.543 --> 04:36.877
underneath
bottle caps.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.078
I never win at that.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.780
They're rigged.
It's a scam to sell soda.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.948
Gorman's clean--

04:40.981 --> 04:42.550
no arrests, no history
of mental illness.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.551
Even if
a butcher did this,

04:43.584 --> 04:44.652
there'd have
to be sutures.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.920
He's not going to let him
walk out of there bleeding.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.090
Maybe Gorman freaked
in the middle of the procedure
and left.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.492
I Googled "castrator,"

04:51.525 --> 04:53.394
and up pops
this Dr. Amos Dudayev.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.463
He runs a genital chop shop
up in Riverdale.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.565
Guys actually pay him
to do the deed.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.733
You know, the 2 train
runs south from Riverdale.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.835
Gorman could've got clipped
by Dr. Weirdo,

05:01.869 --> 05:03.604
then caught the subway home.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.472
Then loses
too much blood

05:04.505 --> 05:06.106
and passes out
on the subway platform?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.007
He's embarrassed,

05:07.040 --> 05:09.009
so, he blames it all
on some homeless guy.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.412
We get the surveillance
tapes from Transit yet?

05:11.445 --> 05:12.513
FIN:
Still waiting.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.814
Olivia, Elliot,
see if CSU

05:13.847 --> 05:15.716
has a lead on
this homeless guy.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.652
You two pay Dr.
Dudayev a house call.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.625
DUDAYEV:
Yes, I castrate men.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.127
Right on this table.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.462
I sterilize first.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.597
I am a doctor.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.098
MUNCH:
Can you prove it?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.906
State license to
practice medicine.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.508
You're an allergist.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.075
I'm still a doctor.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.644
That doesn't
give you license

05:43.677 --> 05:45.446
to relieve men
of their peckers.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.515
If you ask me to beat you
and I do,

05:47.548 --> 05:49.850
have I committed a crime? No.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.886
Someone wants me to excise
their testicles or penis,

05:52.920 --> 05:54.054
it's the same thing.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.756
Is this one of your volunteers?

05:55.789 --> 05:57.090
Never seen him,

05:57.124 --> 05:59.159
but I'd be happy
to take a referral.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.661
Gorman's shoes

06:00.694 --> 06:01.829
match the footprints.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.565
We followed them
back from the escalator

06:04.598 --> 06:05.699
to the pool of blood

06:05.733 --> 06:07.668
here in this
construction area.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.638
So, he gets off the train,
homeless guy jumps him,

06:10.671 --> 06:11.505
chops him back here

06:11.539 --> 06:13.541
and skips down
the abandoned tunnel.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.409
Unfortunately, this site

06:15.443 --> 06:18.111
is outside the range
of the surveillance camera.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.180
Any sign
of the, uh, missing goods?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.416
Not yet.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.551
Detectives,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.486
we got some blood drops
over here!

06:30.190 --> 06:31.892
Looks like Gorman
wasn't lying

06:31.925 --> 06:33.527
about a homeless guy.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.862
Detectives,

06:34.895 --> 06:35.929
we got somebody.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.097
WOMAN:
Get your paws off me!

06:37.130 --> 06:38.098
You talk to her.

06:38.131 --> 06:38.899
I'll take a look around.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.833
Hey, put her down.
Put her down.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.869
Settle down.
Look at me.
Look at me.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.003
We're not going
to hurt you.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.137
We're not going
to hurt you.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.039
What's your name?
Dot.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.441
Hey, Dot, you see anyone

06:47.475 --> 06:48.709
come down here this morning?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.143
I can't tell you.
He'd cut my eyes out.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.579
Who will?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.814
Samuel. He sees everything.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.516
No blood.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.185
Hey, Dot, did you see
Samuel this morning?

06:58.218 --> 07:00.454
I promise we're not going to
say anything if you tell us.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.690
He came running
into the tunnel.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.992
His, his hands
were all bloody.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.994
He said
he got an offering.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.596
What kind
of offering?

07:08.629 --> 07:09.863
A human sacrifice.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.768
Dot, where does
Samuel live?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.236
Down below.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.105
At the Grand Center.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.080
Samuel's somewhere

07:27.114 --> 07:29.550
in there.

07:29.583 --> 07:33.053
Samuel's been living
under Grand Central

07:33.086 --> 07:35.155
for years.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.692
BENSON:
Is he violent?

07:38.726 --> 07:41.194
I wouldn't want to run
into him by myself.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.567
His crib is right
around here somewhere.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.504
There it is.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.840
Right in there.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.278
Clear.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.048
BENSON:
Elliot, fresh blood.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.251
Oh, God.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.089
What do we have here?

08:11.258 --> 08:14.061
Mr. Gorman's missing parts.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.765
It's him.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.202
( growling )

08:23.203 --> 08:25.238
Police! Stop! Police!

08:30.978 --> 08:32.713
( grunting )

08:35.348 --> 08:38.051
Cuffs?
Yeah.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.588
Why are you in such
a hurry there, Samuel?

08:40.621 --> 08:42.155
I can't see!

08:42.189 --> 08:43.924
Why don't you take
off those sunglasses?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.158
( screaming )

08:45.192 --> 08:47.094
Stop it! You're hurting me!

08:47.127 --> 08:48.328
You're coming
with us, pal.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.030
No, no light!

08:50.063 --> 08:53.233
Not into the light, please!

08:53.266 --> 08:57.304
It'll burn my skin,
eat my eyes! Please!

08:57.337 --> 08:59.006
( groaning )

08:59.039 --> 09:01.575
Samuel...

09:01.609 --> 09:03.310
I'm Dr. Huang.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.947
Light, too much light.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.016
You're hurting me.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.221
Is that better, Samuel?

09:24.231 --> 09:27.935
Not Samuel.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.303
My name is Samael.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.340
Lucifer when he was in heaven.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.341
Yes. Before

09:34.374 --> 09:36.644
the fall from grace.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.746
When he was still an angel.

09:38.779 --> 09:43.250
God wants Samael
to return to heaven,

09:43.283 --> 09:46.720
but Samael
belongs to the darkness.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.622
Does God speak to you, Samael?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.724
No.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.694
He sends his archangel.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.997
She brings me... offerings.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.900
What kind of offerings?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.168
The jewels

10:01.201 --> 10:02.235
of Sodom.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.704
What does this

10:03.737 --> 10:05.105
angel look like?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.940
She wears
a white hood,

10:06.974 --> 10:08.041
and she carries

10:08.075 --> 10:10.377
a shining sword.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.880
She cuts the limb

10:12.913 --> 10:15.248
from the
Judas tree.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.089
Don't tell me--
Catholic vampire?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.925
I think he has a genetic
disorder called porphyria.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.760
That accounts
for his light sensitivity

10:26.794 --> 10:27.861
and his
abdominal pains.

10:27.895 --> 10:28.862
And the delusions?

10:28.896 --> 10:30.330
Porphyria could be
causing that, too.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.365
Well, we got
an eyewitness,

10:32.399 --> 10:35.068
and when we found him,
he had Gorman's goodies on him.
He's our guy.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.104
He's violent, so he's
definitely capable,

10:37.137 --> 10:38.538
but the light
literally hurts him.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.675
I don't think
he would have ventured out
onto the subway platform.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.978
Well, what did he do,
have a messenger deliver
him Gorman's package?

10:45.012 --> 10:48.181
Let's find out.
Transit is here with
the surveillance tapes.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.284
LARRY:
Here comes
the 2 train.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.386
CRAGEN:
Only one camera
on the platform?

10:53.420 --> 10:54.421
Yup. Another's

10:54.454 --> 10:55.422
on the escalators,

10:55.455 --> 10:57.324
but the camera
doesn't cover

10:57.357 --> 10:59.426
where your guy got
sliced and diced.

11:00.293 --> 11:04.164
There he is.
That's your guy.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.035
BENSON:
Hang on. White hood.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.436
That Samuel's angel?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.038
STABLER:
Could be.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.439
He talked to her.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.007
They know each other.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.208
( phone ringing )

11:15.242 --> 11:16.944
Come on, baby.
Show us your face.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.211
Look up. Look up.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.279
Stabler.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.114
LARRY:
That's all I got.

11:21.148 --> 11:21.915
Camera stops there.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.817
She follows him.
She knocks him out.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.052
She cuts him up.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.720
There's nobody around
to stop her.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.789
Let's find out
why Mr. Gorman lied to us.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.090
Well, that was the hospital.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.359
Mr. Gorman
just checked himself out,

11:32.392 --> 11:33.861
against medical advice.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.328
See if he went home.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.901
CONCIERGE:
Mr. Gorman?

11:40.934 --> 11:42.936
Mr. Gorman, it's the police.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.119
The guy's got enough newspapers
and toilet paper

11:59.152 --> 12:00.487
to last a lifetime.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.522
Mr. Gorman have any
women in his life?

12:02.555 --> 12:04.958
Uh, no, he's
a confirmed bachelor.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.761
Well, that's funny.
He's got wedding photos.

12:07.795 --> 12:11.364
You recognize
the wife?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.901
No, I've
never seen her.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.337
Elliot...

12:17.370 --> 12:19.306
all these women are different.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.475
Gorman's been spreading
the joy around.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.412
The brides are all wearing
the same wedding dress.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.081
And the same dog collar.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.050
Oh, my God.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.118
What?

12:31.151 --> 12:33.186
I know her.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.421
How?

12:34.454 --> 12:35.622
She came in to the squad.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.525
She said that she'd been kept
in a dungeon by some freak

12:38.558 --> 12:40.127
and forced to marry him.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.465
She was drunk,
and I didn't believe her.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.905
Her name is
Hilary Barclay.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.942
She came in here
about four years ago.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.109
It was a rainy night.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.177
Guy offers her a ride.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.345
She gets in the car.

12:58.378 --> 12:59.512
He kidnaps her.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.248
He keeps her locked up
for three months.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.950
And then one day,
he just tells her

13:02.983 --> 13:04.117
that she's going home.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.853
He blindfolds her,
he drives her around,

13:05.886 --> 13:06.854
and he dumps her.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.888
You checked it out?

13:07.921 --> 13:09.056
There was
nothing to check.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.223
All she would
give me was

13:10.257 --> 13:12.025
that it was a
white older male

13:12.059 --> 13:13.226
driving a
dark two-door.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.895
But you didn't buy her story.

13:14.928 --> 13:15.929
I wish I had.

13:15.963 --> 13:16.930
I remember her, Captain.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.067
She was drinkin', druggin',
totally incoherent.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.601
With a good reason
to make it all up.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.503
She took a drug collar
right before her disappearance.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.538
She missed her court date,
so judge issued a bench
warrant.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.574
Yeah, but she said
that the guy forced her

13:27.607 --> 13:29.442
to put on a wedding gown
and marry him.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.478
Last known address was a place
in the East Village.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.346
Landlord said
she moved out two years ago.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.381
No forwarding address.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.117
Her mother is Juliet Barclay.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.185
The supermodel?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.920
Yeah. She now owns
an antiquity shop

13:39.953 --> 13:41.121
on Madison Avenue.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.356
Maybe she knows
where the daughter is.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.127
Hilary and I
are estranged.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.062
So, if this is another
of her sob stories,

13:49.096 --> 13:50.297
you're wasting your time.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.464
Hilary didn't come to us.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.200
We're actually looking for her.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.003
Well, I haven't
seen or spoken to
her in two years.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.938
Has she tried to contact you?

13:57.971 --> 14:00.908
Just once.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.076
I did not reciprocate.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.946
She's still your daughter.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.114
Excuse me?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.916
She's brought me nothing
but grief.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.583
She's a junkie.

14:10.617 --> 14:13.220
When she wasn't in and out
of rehab or psych wards,

14:13.253 --> 14:14.988
she was stealing from my store,

14:15.022 --> 14:18.125
wrecking my marriages,
telling outrageous lies.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.227
My pregnancy ended
my modeling career.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.095
Sounds like
you never wanted her.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.397
Women didn't have the choice
back then.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.367
So, whatever she's done now,
it is her problem.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.004
She was kidnapped and raped.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.139
What are you
talking about?

14:32.172 --> 14:33.673
That story that she told you
four years ago

14:33.706 --> 14:35.142
about being abducted was true.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.244
What crazy lie
is she telling now?

14:37.277 --> 14:38.378
STABLER:
We have evidence.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.481
Photos. It happened pretty much
the way she reported it.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.420
My God.

14:47.454 --> 14:50.090
She begged me to believe her,
and I didn't.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.624
No one did.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.265
Ms. Barclay, do you know
how we can find Hilary?

14:58.298 --> 15:01.168
She wrote me a letter
last month asking for
money.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.304
She's somewhere
on the Lower East Side.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.608
( knocking )

15:12.445 --> 15:14.281
I remember you, Detective.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.715
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.284
We need to talk.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.285
How did you find me?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.988
BENSON:
Your mother,
from the letter you sent.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.489
I bet she never read it.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.590
I told her I'm clean now,

15:23.623 --> 15:25.225
and getting my life together,

15:25.258 --> 15:27.060
but she still doesn't want
to have anything to do with me.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.395
BENSON:
She wants to talk to you now.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.263
Screw her.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.099
And screw you.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.470
We know you were telling
the truth about what happened.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.973
Took you long enough.

15:40.007 --> 15:43.210
So I guess I wasn't so crazy
after all, was I?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.979
Hilary, you have
every reason to
be angry with me.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.315
Yeah, you bet your ass I do.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.749
Now get out.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.218
BENSON:
Hilary,

15:51.251 --> 15:52.385
we need
your help.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.421
So you can do nothing again?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.623
I told you all about that man
and his dungeon.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.359
He may be holding
another woman.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.693
You know who he is?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.295
Yeah, we do.
We're looking for him.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.264
Well, what's his name?

16:04.297 --> 16:05.232
How did you find him?

16:05.265 --> 16:07.167
We can't talk about
the investigation yet.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.236
Where were you
the night before last?

16:09.269 --> 16:10.403
I was at an NA meeting.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.604
Why?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.406
STABLER:
Someone
attacked him.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.407
Good.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.576
BENSON:
But he
got away.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.746
Hilary, I need you
to tell me everything

16:19.779 --> 16:20.780
that you remember

16:20.813 --> 16:22.715
about where
he kept you.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.323
He called it his party place.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.325
It was a hellhole.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.327
I thought I'd die there.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.096
I would have killed
the son of a bitch,

16:36.129 --> 16:37.664
but he kept a combination lock
on the door,

16:37.697 --> 16:39.266
so I never would have
gotten out.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.533
What about windows?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.269
There weren't any.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.237
And it was cold

16:44.271 --> 16:47.374
and damp, so I think
we were in a basement.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.343
Did you hear anything?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.279
You'll think I'm crazy.

16:52.312 --> 16:55.014
Hilary, believe me,
that's the one thing
we won't think.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.285
I heard singing,

16:58.318 --> 17:00.353
chanting,
in a strange language

17:00.387 --> 17:02.755
like some kind
of satanic cult.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.161
He certainly was the devil.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.330
You find anything, John?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.199
Horace Gorman's never walked
down the aisle.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.366
He's got no kids we can find.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.735
But for a gentile, he's given
a lot of money to the Jews.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.404
Any Jews in particular?

17:17.437 --> 17:20.140
The B'nai Barak
Synagogue on the
Lower East Side.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.209
He's an architecture
freak. He won an award

17:22.242 --> 17:24.311
for funding
the restoration
of the temple.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.478
Chanting.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.713
From the dungeon.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.515
Hilary said
that she heard chanting

17:28.548 --> 17:29.649
in a strange
language.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.850
Hebrew.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.520
Hilary must have heard
the cantor.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.423
Horace was our savior,
if you'll pardon the
expression.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.125
Back in '98,

17:38.158 --> 17:40.460
he personally supervised
the whole restoration.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.594
Haven't seen
him since.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.230
So he had access
to the basement.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.264
To the
whole shul.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.265
You find him?

17:45.298 --> 17:47.100
No, but I came as soon
as I heard.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.501
My folks brought me here once.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.636
They're Jewish?

17:49.669 --> 17:51.304
No, but neither was this place

17:51.338 --> 17:52.505
a couple of hundred years ago.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.773
It was an Episcopal church,

17:53.806 --> 17:56.143
and a major stop
on the Underground Railroad.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.278
Explains
why he's your
biggest donor.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.647
What does hiding slaves have
to do with Horace Gorman?

18:00.680 --> 18:03.283
Secret tunnels.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.153
Underground railroad brought
slaves to Manhattan,

18:06.186 --> 18:07.487
moved them
through these tunnels,

18:07.520 --> 18:09.389
up the Hudson,
and on to Canada.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.823
Gorman must have
found this place

18:10.857 --> 18:12.592
when he was
restoring
the synagogue.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.826
SIPER:
Detectives?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.496
We got something here.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.599
Okay. An anomaly
on the scope.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.368
There's a void
behind that wall.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.402
Maybe another room.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.182
We're through.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.155
STABLER:
A toilet.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.556
A bathtub,
microwave.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.458
All the comforts of home.

18:45.492 --> 18:49.362
A bed, TV set.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.730
We got access.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.565
I'll go through the tunnel,
see where it goes.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.467
Got a light.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.738
Oh, my God.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.343
Barely got a pulse.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.578
Radio for a bus
and get me bolt cutters.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.615
( garbled radio transmission )

19:10.450 --> 19:11.484
Raise me on the radio

19:11.518 --> 19:13.286
as soon as you get
to the hospital.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.257
Elliot, I found
the tunnel exit back
here.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.197
His own
private entrance.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.865
Wait until dark,
bring the women down.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.300
Nobody would ever see him.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.601
We hit the jackpot.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.637
The wacko kept diaries.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.244
Our victim's
still unconscious,

19:37.277 --> 19:38.678
dehydrated
and malnourished.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.846
Won't be able
to talk for a while.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.013
Listen to this.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.217
"My first bride is feisty,
but I will break her spirit.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.686
She dare not move
without my permission."

19:46.719 --> 19:49.222
"How quickly
this new wife learned my rules.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.824
She kissed my feet gladly
for a crust of bread."

19:51.858 --> 19:53.860
"I am her lord and master.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.696
Her life belongs to me,
and she'll beg to keep it."

19:56.729 --> 19:58.265
This guy's sick.
He hates women.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.800
HUANG:
But he likes
humiliation and control.

20:00.833 --> 20:01.968
And variety.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.870
Different ages, races,
body types.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.339
By "marrying" these women,
he owns them.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.741
Feels entitled to use them
however he wants.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.378
He's a collector.
Magazines, toilet paper,
women--

20:11.411 --> 20:12.745
it's all the same to him.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.647
BENSON:
Elliot, come here
and look at this.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.449
Check out the background.
It's plaster walls.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.885
Gorman's dungeon
had stone walls.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.587
Same as this one.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.854
Okay, okay.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.724
It looks like
Gorman marries his wives
in some other place.

20:24.757 --> 20:25.758
This could be
where he's hiding out.

20:25.792 --> 20:26.926
MUNCH:
The victims might know
where he took them.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.829
But they haven't come forward.
Do you think he killed them?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.030
He released Hilary.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.865
I'd say he lets
them go when
he gets bored.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.301
So we got a half
a dozen women

20:34.334 --> 20:35.802
who would love
to make this guy a falsetto.

20:35.835 --> 20:36.803
Which is why he lied.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.870
He couldn't tell us
who sliced him

20:37.904 --> 20:38.871
without giving himself up.a

20:38.905 --> 20:40.273
It's one of these women.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.808
That's why he bolted
from the hospital,

20:41.841 --> 20:43.576
because they wanted
to shut him up permanently.

20:43.610 --> 20:44.911
Elliott, can I
talk to you?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.479
Yeah. What's up, Lauren?

20:46.513 --> 20:47.714
I'm here
about a client.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.048
17-year-old
runaway who says

20:49.081 --> 20:51.384
some guy raped her
in a dungeon.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.654
Her name's Neva.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.023
She called me after
she saw the news.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.358
This one.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.997
He said he owned me.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.934
I had to call him "Sir."

21:07.967 --> 21:13.440
If I didn't do exactly
what Sir said, he'd kill me.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.876
What else did
he want you to do?

21:16.909 --> 21:19.412
Keep diaries.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.448
Of what?

21:21.481 --> 21:23.950
When I ate,

21:23.983 --> 21:25.518
when I peed.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.853
NEVA AND HILARY:
When he...

21:26.886 --> 21:28.688
...had sex with me.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.358
He made me
write him love letters.

21:31.391 --> 21:35.027
When did he make
you put on the
wedding gown?

21:35.061 --> 21:37.530
After I'd been there a while.

21:37.564 --> 21:41.434
He said it was time
to get married.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.870
Where was
the wedding?

21:43.903 --> 21:46.439
HILARY AND NEVA:
Someplace else.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.008
He blindfolded me,

21:49.041 --> 21:53.513
took me down in the tunnel,

21:53.546 --> 21:55.682
put me in a car.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.350
He took off the blindfold

21:57.384 --> 22:00.853
in the lobby
of some ratty hotel.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.889
Anybody see you?

22:03.923 --> 22:06.058
The manager.

22:06.092 --> 22:10.697
But Sir said if I screamed,
he'd kill my family.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.733
Then he took me up to the room.

22:13.766 --> 22:17.604
NEVA AND HILARY:
And he called it
the honeymoon suite.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.039
He had candles,

22:20.072 --> 22:23.476
flowers, cheap champagne.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.114
HILARY AND NEVA:
Then he took pictures.

22:28.147 --> 22:32.785
Sir said we were man and wife.

22:32.819 --> 22:36.556
He made me drink a toast.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.558
Then he said it was time...

22:38.591 --> 22:44.130
NEVA AND HILARY:
...to consummate the marriage.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.599
And he raped me again.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.069
Could you see
anything out
the window?

22:50.102 --> 22:51.971
We were facing an alley.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.173
Do you remember
hearing any sounds?

22:54.206 --> 22:55.942
Boat horns,

22:55.975 --> 22:57.510
like near the river.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.545
Uh-huh.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.847
And helicopters.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.050
They seemed real close.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.485
STABLER:
The only chopper pad

23:05.518 --> 23:07.153
on the East Side
is off 34th Street.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.155
Real estate around there's
too expensive

23:09.188 --> 23:10.156
for a grubby hotel.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.091
What about one
of those SROs

23:12.124 --> 23:14.594
near the helipad
by Chelsea Piers?

23:14.627 --> 23:16.095
That's got to be it.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.196
Where's Olivia?

23:17.229 --> 23:19.031
She walked out with
Hilary a while ago.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.033
We can't wait. Let's go.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.738
MUNCH:
Know this guy?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.675
Never seen him before.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.510
A little
incentive help
your memory?

23:30.543 --> 23:32.545
Show me the money.

23:32.579 --> 23:33.946
How about you keep your teeth?

23:33.980 --> 23:35.715
Okay, he's here,
but he's busy.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.816
What room?

23:36.849 --> 23:38.417
213.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.689
Police! Don't move.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.098
What the hell happened?

23:52.131 --> 23:54.767
He was dead when I got here.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.646
What did
the ME say?

24:06.679 --> 24:08.047
That he'd been dead
less than an hour.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.882
Single stab wound
to the chest.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.183
Most likely
a smooth-edged knife.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.652
Like the one used
to castrate him.

24:12.685 --> 24:13.820
I'm taking the body
to the morgue now.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.622
I'll call you
as soon as we know.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.993
Are you
protecting her?

24:24.130 --> 24:25.832
You think that
I'm covering for Hilary?

24:29.135 --> 24:30.637
Where'd you drop her off?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.872
At her mother's.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.541
They're estranged, remember?

24:34.574 --> 24:36.008
Hilary wanted to talk to her.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.176
When'd you leave her there?

24:37.209 --> 24:38.611
A couple hours ago,

24:38.645 --> 24:40.246
and I don't need you
interrogating me.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.148
Why didn't you
come back to the squad?

24:42.181 --> 24:43.616
Because I had a hunch.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.084
I checked out five hotels,

24:45.117 --> 24:46.118
and this one was number six.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.820
Without backup?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.491
What the hell's
the matter with you?

24:54.060 --> 24:55.094
Eliot, don't start with me...

24:55.127 --> 24:56.295
You're out of control...

24:56.328 --> 24:58.965
I never had control
of this one, remember?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.801
I lost my judgment.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.304
Everyone makes mistakes.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.039
Get over it.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.878
( woman speaking
foreign language )

25:11.911 --> 25:13.212
WOMAN:
He said he's looking
for a date.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.714
CRAGEN:
Did anyone report
you missing?

25:14.747 --> 25:15.915
WOMAN:
No.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.717
Who cares about a lousy...?

25:17.750 --> 25:19.886
So this wasn't
the first time...?

25:19.919 --> 25:21.854
( speaking foreign language )

25:26.859 --> 25:28.294
I'll be right back.

25:30.730 --> 25:32.331
The women
from the wedding albums.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.933
How'd you
find them so fast?

25:33.966 --> 25:35.167
They found us.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.703
They saw the story
on the evening news.

25:36.736 --> 25:37.870
So when did
he snatch them?

25:37.904 --> 25:39.706
Haven't gotten
that far...

25:39.739 --> 25:41.974
When did Gorman
kidnap them?

25:43.075 --> 25:45.111
After Hilary.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.667
Hold on.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.770
What's going on?

26:10.803 --> 26:11.938
I can't do this anymore.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.640
It's not your fault.

26:13.673 --> 26:17.043
One of those victims
must've killed Gorman.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.045
And the worst part is...

26:19.078 --> 26:21.047
none of this would've happened

26:21.080 --> 26:22.815
if I would have
just believed Hilary.

26:22.849 --> 26:25.284
These are vulnerable women
no one would believe.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.754
You can't control
what other people do.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.656
There will always
be perps and victims.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.057
You think you need
to tell me that?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.659
Only reason I'm standing here

26:32.692 --> 26:34.160
is because my mother
let herself get raped.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.062
Let herself?
Since when do you
blame the victim?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.830
My mother
was drunk.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.633
And so was Hilary.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.301
And that's why
I didn't believe her.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.370
Now these women
are paying for it.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.972
Okay, quit.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.273
Quit.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.908
Throw away the good you've done

26:48.941 --> 26:51.143
and the good you'll do
over one mistake.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.220
Let's go.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.388
Where?

27:02.421 --> 27:06.092
To find out which one of our
victims killed our rapist.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.998
STABLER:
Tell me which
of these women you saw.

27:12.031 --> 27:15.702
I saw no woman.
Only an archangel.

27:15.735 --> 27:19.171
Okay, Samuel,
is one of these your angel?

27:19.205 --> 27:22.975
Look here.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.885
Is that her?

27:32.919 --> 27:35.154
That's my angel.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.390
Detectives, my daughter's been
through quite an ordeal today.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.226
Could we maybe do this
in the morning?

27:40.259 --> 27:42.028
We found Horace Gorman.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.832
Thank God.

27:45.865 --> 27:49.168
I want to see him.
I need to see him locked up.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.236
He's dead.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.204
He was murdered.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.274
Good.

27:55.307 --> 27:56.876
I hope he suffered.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.477
It's over, Hilary.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.848
Maybe for you.

28:01.881 --> 28:05.084
Detectives, do you
know who killed him?

28:05.117 --> 28:06.218
It was you, Hilary.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.157
You're wrong.

28:11.190 --> 28:15.127
No one hated him more than me,
but I didn't kill him.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.263
No, no, no,
you can't take her.
You can't take her!

28:17.296 --> 28:19.899
You can't take her.
She's suffered enough already!

28:19.932 --> 28:22.168
Mrs. Barclay,
stand over here.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.169
Mom...

28:23.202 --> 28:24.837
Mom, I...

28:24.871 --> 28:27.774
I did it!

28:27.807 --> 28:29.075
Take me.

28:30.309 --> 28:33.179
Mrs. Barclay, do you realize
what you're saying?

28:33.212 --> 28:35.481
Yes, I do.
I killed the bastard.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.483
I had to protect my daughter.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.253
Let's go.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.122
Mom...

28:43.155 --> 28:46.292
Mom, don't do this.
Mom...

28:49.261 --> 28:51.230
Juliet Barclay,
you're under arrest
This is a mistake!

28:51.263 --> 28:53.099
for the murder
of Horace Norman.
You're wrong!

28:53.132 --> 28:55.201
You have the right
to remain silent.
My mother didn't do it!

28:55.234 --> 28:56.936
If you give up that right,
anything you say

28:56.969 --> 28:59.238
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
Mom?

28:59.271 --> 29:01.974
You have the right
to an attorney...
Mom?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.912
Horace Gorman murdered
my daughter's soul.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.280
And I made it worse
by not believing her.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.352
I did what any mother would do.

29:16.188 --> 29:20.126
I spent years blaming her
for my problems.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.296
It was time
to make things right.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.466
Well, there are
a few loose ends here.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.569
Like how'd you know who Gorman
was and where to find him?

29:30.602 --> 29:31.437
Last week,
Hilary

29:31.470 --> 29:34.206
saw him leaving
his apartment building.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.243
She recognized him right away.
It was a terrible shock.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.811
She didn't know what to do,

29:38.845 --> 29:40.412
so she
came to me.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.481
Why didn't you
go to the police?

29:42.514 --> 29:44.416
You didn't listen to her
four years ago

29:44.450 --> 29:46.585
when that monster abducted her,
did you?

29:46.618 --> 29:49.255
I knew Hilary would
never be safe
while that man

29:49.288 --> 29:50.957
was alive.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.092
I followed Gorman
for a few days,

29:53.125 --> 29:55.828
then I castrated him
at the subway station.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.163
I didn't want
to kill him

29:57.196 --> 29:59.198
in case he was holding
a woman captive.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.300
How'd you know
where to find Gorman tonight?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.069
He never went
to the dungeon.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.603
He would hang out
with these hookers

30:04.636 --> 30:06.438
at that dingy hotel.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.507
When you told Hilary
that he'd fled,

30:08.540 --> 30:11.410
I knew
where he was.

30:11.443 --> 30:14.813
Why don't you walk us through
exactly what happened tonight?

30:18.284 --> 30:20.119
I knocked on his door,

30:20.152 --> 30:24.023
and I asked
if he wanted company.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.492
My only though was what
he'd done to my daughter.

30:26.525 --> 30:29.161
He let me in, and I...

30:30.396 --> 30:32.398
I stabbed him.

30:35.902 --> 30:39.271
There was so much blood.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.544
What'd you do
with the knife?

30:45.577 --> 30:48.347
I threw it just down the sewer,

30:48.380 --> 30:52.118
just a couple blocks
from there.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.059
Juliet Barclay's confession

31:00.092 --> 31:02.294
was nothing more than
a mother's desperate attempt

31:02.328 --> 31:03.129
to protect her daughter.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.531
Dream on.
She was properly Mirandized.

31:05.564 --> 31:07.066
Doesn't matter.

31:07.099 --> 31:09.501
This is the clearest Payton
violation I've ever seen.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.437
Is that true, Miss Novak?

31:11.470 --> 31:14.040
Did the police arrest
the defendant inside her home?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.007
No, she wasn't arrested

31:15.041 --> 31:17.376
until after she stepped
outside her apartment.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.544
She didn't step outside.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.546
She was forcibly dragged
by the police.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.248
She wasn't cuffed
or restrained.

31:22.281 --> 31:23.082
She was intimidated.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.384
Two armed police officers
woke her up

31:25.417 --> 31:27.186
in the middle of night
and threatened her daughter

31:27.219 --> 31:28.354
before her eyes.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.156
She volunteered
to go to the precinct.

31:30.189 --> 31:31.991
Under extreme duress.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.192
You and
your officers

31:33.225 --> 31:34.493
should know better.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.495
Juliet Barclay's
confession is out.

31:36.528 --> 31:39.465
My courtroom at 10:00
for jury selection.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.133
Your Honor, I...

31:43.535 --> 31:45.304
Ready to talk plea?

31:45.337 --> 31:46.405
Not on your life.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.474
You don't have anything.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.477
I have the spontaneous
admission in the apartment.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.213
Juliet said,
and I quote, "I did it."

31:54.246 --> 31:55.647
What more do I need?

32:02.154 --> 32:06.058
NOVAK:
Horace Gorman was an evil man
who committed unspeakable acts

32:06.092 --> 32:09.228
of violence, depravity
and cruelty.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.097
Nothing would've
pleased me more

32:11.130 --> 32:13.532
than to convict him
and send him to jail

32:13.565 --> 32:15.567
for the rest of his life...

32:15.601 --> 32:17.736
but I can't.

32:17.769 --> 32:23.209
I can't, because this woman
took the law into her own hands

32:23.242 --> 32:25.144
and executed Horace Gorman.

32:25.177 --> 32:26.745
Now, some of you
may be thinking,

32:26.778 --> 32:29.548
"Hey, good for her,"
or "You'd do the same

32:29.581 --> 32:31.483
to anyone who'd
hurt your child."

32:31.517 --> 32:34.453
We all understand the impulse
to take revenge,

32:34.486 --> 32:36.422
but that doesn't mean
we should do it.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.026
No one is above the law.

32:40.059 --> 32:43.262
Murder is murder,
no matter who commits it...

32:43.295 --> 32:45.564
or why.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.604
Ms. Novak's arguments
make sense to me,

32:52.638 --> 32:54.740
and I hope to you.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.376
"Murder is murder,
no matter who commits it,"

32:57.409 --> 32:59.678
but ladies and gentlemen,

32:59.711 --> 33:02.414
we don't know
who killed Mr. Gorman.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.216
Sure, the DA indicted

33:04.250 --> 33:08.054
my client, but an indictment
isn't evidence.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.689
Juliet Barclay
may have had a motive
to kill Horace Gorman,

33:10.722 --> 33:13.792
but motive isn't evidence...

33:13.825 --> 33:17.063
and if it was,
Juliet Barclay is only one

33:17.096 --> 33:20.466
of any number of women
with the same motive.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.434
There's one woman

33:22.468 --> 33:24.170
who had more
than just the motive

33:24.203 --> 33:25.537
to kill Horace Gorman.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.574
She also had the means
and the opportunity.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.176
A woman who knew exactly where

33:30.209 --> 33:32.311
Horace Gorman was hiding,

33:32.344 --> 33:35.414
and went there alone
to take her revenge.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.583
A woman with a desperate desire

33:37.616 --> 33:40.252
to see Mr. Gorman pay
for his sins

33:40.286 --> 33:42.521
and atone for her own.

33:42.554 --> 33:47.159
That woman
is Detective Olivia Benson.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.596
Objection, Your Honor!
( gavel banging )

33:50.629 --> 33:53.599
PETROVSKY:
Order! Order, or I'll
clear the courtroom...

33:58.370 --> 34:00.672
I can't believe Granger's
making me a suspect.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.740
You went to the
hotel alone.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.142
You were found
with the body.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.843
He's trying to create
reasonable doubt.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.112
So what the hell do I do?

34:06.145 --> 34:08.514
Fall on your sword.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.682
Meaning what?

34:10.716 --> 34:12.584
You'll admit that you
screwed up four years ago

34:12.618 --> 34:14.286
and that you went to
the hotel room alone,

34:14.320 --> 34:15.554
then you'll deny
you murdered Gorman.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.289
Casey...
I-I got to talk
to my boss,

34:17.323 --> 34:19.191
see if I can
fix this mess.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.529
She didn't even ask me
if I did it.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.696
She can't.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.833
Look, if she did,
and you admitted
killing Gorman,

34:27.866 --> 34:29.835
she couldn't put you
on the stand without
suborning perjury.

34:31.203 --> 34:35.274
You didn't ask me, either.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.109
I know you didn't.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.111
You'd have shot
the bastard.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.884
Hilary said that she'd heard
choppers from the hotel.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.620
There's only half a dozen
fleabags in the vicinity,

34:48.654 --> 34:49.821
so I decided to
check 'em out.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.524
Why not call your partner?

34:52.558 --> 34:54.260
Well, I was going to
canvass the desk clerks,

34:54.293 --> 34:56.828
call for backup
if I got a photo hit.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.665
The clerk at the Lydia said
that he'd seen Gorman come in.

34:59.698 --> 35:00.766
I thought
that he might have a woman

35:00.799 --> 35:03.902
up there, so I
didn't want to wait
and risk her life.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.137
When you entered

35:05.171 --> 35:07.339
the room,
what did you find?

35:07.373 --> 35:08.640
Horace Gorman's body

35:08.674 --> 35:10.676
lying on the floor... dead.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.844
Detective Benson...

35:12.878 --> 35:15.147
did you kill him?

35:15.181 --> 35:18.150
No, I did not.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.453
Thank you.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.555
Four years ago, Hilary
Barclay came to you

35:23.589 --> 35:25.691
and reported she'd been
abducted and raped.

35:25.724 --> 35:26.792
Did you close her case

35:26.825 --> 35:28.727
because you thought
she'd made the whole thing up?

35:28.760 --> 35:29.895
Yes.

35:29.928 --> 35:30.762
How many women were abducted

35:30.796 --> 35:32.864
after Hilary told you
about her ordeal?

35:32.898 --> 35:36.802
Six.
So the abduction, rape,
and torture of six women

35:36.835 --> 35:39.871
occurred because you failed
to believe Hilary's story.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.374
Those six victims
were assaulted

35:42.408 --> 35:44.310
because Horace Gorman
was a psychopath.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.311
Whom you failed

35:45.344 --> 35:46.578
to bring to justice.

35:46.612 --> 35:47.879
Is that why you went
to the hotel

35:47.913 --> 35:49.748
alone...
No.

35:49.781 --> 35:50.749
or so you could
redeem yourself

35:50.782 --> 35:52.318
by arresting him
on your own,

35:52.351 --> 35:54.253
or so you could kill him
without any witnesses?

35:54.286 --> 35:55.687
Objection, Your Honor.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.955
Withdrawn.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.358
Explain why,
after finding the body,

35:59.391 --> 36:01.560
you didn't radio your partner.

36:01.593 --> 36:02.961
I was about to when he arrived.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.231
Really? The desk clerk said

36:05.264 --> 36:07.666
there was a ten-minute interval
between your arrival

36:07.699 --> 36:09.034
and that of your colleagues,
and no one else

36:09.067 --> 36:11.270
went up to the room
that night.
The desk clerk

36:11.303 --> 36:13.805
was too busy playing cards
to notice who arrived.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.707
Answer the question,
Detective Benson.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.310
Why didn't you call
when you found the body?

36:18.344 --> 36:20.312
'Cause I was stunned!
Murder can have
that effect

36:20.346 --> 36:22.414
on people, but you know that.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.849
You've murdered twice before,

36:23.882 --> 36:24.683
haven't you?

36:24.716 --> 36:26.585
I shot two suspects
who were armed

36:26.618 --> 36:28.220
and about to commit murder.

36:30.856 --> 36:34.526
Two killings and no charges?

36:35.627 --> 36:37.896
I guess the third time's
the charm.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.003
CRAGEN:
You don't think the jury
buys Olivia as a suspect?

36:45.036 --> 36:46.372
They don't have to,
but it gives them

36:46.405 --> 36:48.006
reasonable doubt
about Juliet's guilt.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.508
You going to be able
to turn 'em?

36:49.541 --> 36:50.876
I don't know.

36:50.909 --> 36:53.379
Hilary's the defense's
first witness.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.247
She'll dirty up Olivia
a little more,

36:55.281 --> 36:57.716
and I can't attack her
because she's the victim.

36:57.749 --> 36:58.917
BENSON:
So Hilary can lie
all she wants?

36:58.950 --> 37:00.886
Yeah, unless I can disprove
what she says,

37:00.919 --> 37:02.521
or we can come up
with something more concrete.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.523
Will gold do?
You got something?

37:04.556 --> 37:07.359
He does. Nick Petracho,
forensic metallurgist.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.261
Warner called him in
because the murder weapon

37:09.295 --> 37:10.696
scraped against Gorman's
sternum

37:10.729 --> 37:13.332
and left microscopic
gold particles on the bone.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.700
The knife was made of gold?

37:14.733 --> 37:18.003
Even solid gold's too soft
for an effective stabbing
implement.

37:18.036 --> 37:21.340
The blade was probably carbon
with decorative gold trim.

37:21.373 --> 37:24.643
I used x-ray
fluorescence analysis.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.945
Based on the refraction index
of the particles,

37:26.978 --> 37:29.881
the gold's 99% pure.

37:29.915 --> 37:30.816
And the other one percent?

37:30.849 --> 37:33.952
Rhodium. Only present
as a trace element

37:33.985 --> 37:37.022
in gold mined in Syria
dating back hundreds of years.

37:37.055 --> 37:40.826
I'd say your knife
is mid-ninth century.

37:40.859 --> 37:45.764
Like one you might find
in Juliet's antique shop.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.302
That's it. I sprayed
every knife here.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.403
No blood.
Was there any way

37:51.437 --> 37:53.672
she could've cleaned 'em
with bleach or something?

37:53.705 --> 37:54.973
No, believe me,
Luminol will pick up

37:55.006 --> 37:56.708
the most microscopic trace
of blood.

37:56.742 --> 37:57.709
FIN:
Check it out.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.545
Found this under the sink.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.717
It's been cleaned,
but the engraving

38:05.751 --> 38:08.554
trapped traces of blood.
Congratulations.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.789
Busted.
Get this to Warner
for DNA analysis.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.724
I need the results
in court by morning.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.829
What time did Detective Benson

38:17.863 --> 38:19.698
drop you off
at your mother's house

38:19.731 --> 38:21.433
the night Horace Gorman
was killed?

38:21.467 --> 38:23.569
Around 10:00.
Giving her ample time

38:23.602 --> 38:24.836
to commit the murder
before her colleagues

38:24.870 --> 38:26.438
found the body at midnight.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.307
NOVAK:
Objection, Your Honor.
Withdrawn. Your witness.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.611
Hilary, do you believe

38:32.644 --> 38:34.880
Detective Benson
killed Horace Gorman?

38:34.913 --> 38:37.115
I know my mother
couldn't have.
Really?

38:37.148 --> 38:40.686
Then explain why
Mr. Gorman's blood
was found on an antique

38:40.719 --> 38:42.754
Syrian sacrificial knife
in your mother's shop.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.457
Sidebar, Your Honor.

38:45.491 --> 38:46.492
My mother didn't do it.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.759
Don't say another word.

38:47.793 --> 38:48.794
She confessed
to save me,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.896
but I did it! I killed Gorman.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.564
Hilary, stop it!
No, Mom,

38:52.598 --> 38:53.565
I have to tell the truth.

38:53.599 --> 38:54.700
Stop her!
Miss Barclay,

38:54.733 --> 38:55.767
I must advise you...

38:55.801 --> 38:57.636
I need to explain.

38:57.669 --> 38:58.770
Gorman's blood
is on the knife

38:58.804 --> 39:00.138
because I took it
from the store.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.707
I still had a key.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.675
I... I used
to steal things

39:03.709 --> 39:04.943
to sell for drugs.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.678
I killed Gorman.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.747
I castrated him, too.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.687
You don't have to protect me
anymore.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.766
The People request a mistrial.

39:27.799 --> 39:28.767
On what grounds?

39:28.800 --> 39:29.968
The defense suborned perjury

39:30.001 --> 39:31.770
when they put Hilary Barclay
on the stand.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.539
Patently untrue.
I had no idea

39:33.572 --> 39:34.906
Hilary was going to confess.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.842
You have my word as an
officer of the court.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.610
Hilary's outburst
poisoned the jury.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.546
Well, if the jury finds
her confession credible,

39:40.579 --> 39:41.813
then they can make
a proper verdict

39:41.847 --> 39:43.849
of Not Guilty.
And what if she's lying?

39:43.882 --> 39:45.584
We need time
to reinvestigate.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.185
GRANGER: You just want
a mistrial so you can
try my client again.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.020
That's double jeopardy,
Your Honor.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.122
Ms. Novak...

39:51.156 --> 39:52.524
I'm sorry.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.593
I cannot grant a mistrial.

39:56.695 --> 40:00.766
Do you have reasonable doubt
as to the defendant's guilt?

40:03.635 --> 40:04.970
At this time...

40:05.003 --> 40:10.442
yes.

40:10.476 --> 40:12.478
Then what is your decision?

40:16.782 --> 40:18.183
The People have no choice

40:18.216 --> 40:21.553
but to dismiss the case
against Juliet Barclay.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.622
Very well.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.223
Ms. Barclay,
the case against you

40:25.256 --> 40:27.693
is dismissed
in the interests of justice.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.194
You are free to go.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.462
( bangs gavel )

40:38.670 --> 40:39.838
Hilary.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.543
Go ahead.

40:44.576 --> 40:45.744
No, you can't take her.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.245
She only did
it to save me.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.915
You can't take her.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.583
Hilary Barclay...
Please, please...

40:51.617 --> 40:53.785
you're under arrest
for the murder of
Horace Gorman.

40:53.819 --> 40:55.253
You can't take her.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.922
It's okay, Mom.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.490
I'll be all right.
Don't worry about me.

40:58.524 --> 40:59.825
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.560
If you give up that right,
anything you say

41:01.593 --> 41:03.128
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.067
Ready to go home?

41:09.100 --> 41:10.936
Hilary's sound asleep
in the cage.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.771
I'm actually going to stay
and take her

41:12.804 --> 41:14.806
to Central Booking
in the morning.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.142
Look, she made
her own choices.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.911
Doesn't mean
that I have to feel good

41:19.945 --> 41:21.847
about her going to jail
for murder.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.715
NOVAK:
She's not.

41:23.749 --> 41:26.117
Juliet's attorney
shared this with me.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.789
Venti whole milk latte.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.526
That's what you ordered
at the coffee shop

41:34.560 --> 41:36.595
when your mother
murdered Gorman.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.630
We saw you on their
surveillance tape.

41:38.664 --> 41:40.799
Are you going to arrest her?

41:40.832 --> 41:42.668
We can't.

41:42.701 --> 41:46.104
Double jeopardy.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.942
I don't mind going to jail.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.578
Because you castrated him?

41:55.046 --> 41:57.315
I followed him for days,

41:57.348 --> 42:00.786
waiting for the right moment
to kill him.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.988
He saw me
on the subway platform.

42:03.021 --> 42:07.726
I said, "I know who you are,"

42:07.759 --> 42:11.563
and that I was going to tell
his dirty secret.

42:11.597 --> 42:16.201
He laughed and
said, "Go ahead.

42:16.234 --> 42:20.338
No one's going to believe
a whoring junkie."

42:20.371 --> 42:24.576
He turned, and I hit him
on back of the head,

42:24.610 --> 42:27.846
and I dragged him
to the end of the platform...

42:27.879 --> 42:30.148
and he was lying there...

42:30.181 --> 42:33.852
and I had the perfect chance
to kill him...

42:36.254 --> 42:39.691
...but then I realized
that castrating him

42:39.725 --> 42:42.560
would make him
suffer even more.

42:43.995 --> 42:47.799
Then you told your mother
what you'd done.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.736
When did you find out
that your mother murdered him?

42:52.137 --> 42:54.640
Not until after you came
to arrest me.

42:56.642 --> 42:59.611
She did it for me.

42:59.645 --> 43:01.346
She wanted to keep me safe.

43:03.181 --> 43:05.684
I couldn't let her go to jail.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.218
NOVAK:
She belongs there.

43:08.887 --> 43:12.724
Now, what happened to you
is horrible, and I am sorry,

43:12.758 --> 43:15.260
but nothing gives you
the right to lie

43:15.293 --> 43:18.196
or your mother
the right to murder.

43:19.998 --> 43:22.400
Well, he'll never torture
another woman again...

43:22.433 --> 43:24.736
will he?

44:01.707 --> 44:03.842
( wolf howling )
