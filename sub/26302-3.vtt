WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.737
-The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.
-(shouts)

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
-May we rise.
-Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.154
-Previously on Empire...
-The new chief executive officer

00:20.188 --> 00:22.690
-of Empire, Jeff Kingsley.
-(applause)

00:22.723 --> 00:24.158
It's not like you've taken
any real assignments

00:24.192 --> 00:26.427
since Jamal domesticated you.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.861
ANDRE:
Gusto. Leave Quincy alone.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.264
GUSTO: I take Princess here
till I'm done with him.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.567
-(shouting)
-(alarm buzzes)

00:33.601 --> 00:37.338
Jeff Kingsley is nothing
but a number cruncher.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.207
So step up with us, the Lyons,

00:39.240 --> 00:40.741
with our brand-new
management company.

00:40.774 --> 00:45.579
We are going to put you first
and your music first.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.948
* My life flashes

00:47.981 --> 00:49.717
* Ahead is my desertion

00:49.750 --> 00:52.620
* His trigger finger makes me
contemplate if I deserve it *

00:52.653 --> 00:55.223
* I'd be damned if my family
would take the hit *

00:55.256 --> 00:58.058
* So be a man and step
in front of this angry man *

00:58.092 --> 00:59.460
* Without a purpose, ah

00:59.493 --> 01:00.928
* Tell me this
ain't a conclusion *

01:00.961 --> 01:02.430
* My body can barely react

01:02.463 --> 01:04.064
* I'm thinking
it's just an illusion *

01:04.098 --> 01:05.733
* But the bullet
is telling me facts *

01:05.766 --> 01:07.468
* 'Cause that's my girl,
and that's my kid *

01:07.501 --> 01:09.237
* If they ain't breathing,
I ain't living *

01:09.270 --> 01:10.904
* Can't express
the feeling, praying *

01:10.938 --> 01:12.240
-* Give me one more minute
-* ...going through my mind

01:12.273 --> 01:14.408
* I can't even define *

01:14.442 --> 01:17.611
* Got to put up a fight,
'cause I ain't ready to die... *

01:17.645 --> 01:19.780
(panting)

01:19.813 --> 01:22.450
(coughing)

01:27.255 --> 01:30.558
COOKIE (in distance):
Boy, get your ass down here!

01:30.591 --> 01:31.892
(sighs)

01:31.925 --> 01:33.827
Mom, why are you screaming
so loud in the morning?

01:33.861 --> 01:36.164
COOKIE: Ooh, you better
watch your tone.

01:36.197 --> 01:40.234
Look at this:
"Lucious Lyon, broke."

01:40.268 --> 01:42.236
And this one:
"Lyons with no pride."

01:42.270 --> 01:45.105
They ain't nothing but trolls,
all of them.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.674
Dad put all of our asses
on blast.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.742
I had a homeless person
trying to give me a dollar

01:48.776 --> 01:49.977
when we was leaving.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.912
Oh, my goodness.
Mom, can I have that?

01:51.945 --> 01:55.749
Y'all fix your faces and wait
for Dad to come back with Andre.

01:55.783 --> 01:59.320
You know what? You're right.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.755
Today is not the day
for doubters.

02:01.789 --> 02:05.959
Today is the day that
the Lyon family are reunited,

02:05.993 --> 02:08.829
-and we prove the haters wrong.
-Say it.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.698
(ringtone playing)

02:10.731 --> 02:13.201
Hey, Lucious. Where are you?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.535
What?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.037
What do you...?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.207
Okay, where the hell
is Andre, then?

02:24.312 --> 02:26.247
(sighs)

02:28.349 --> 02:30.351
MARK:
Stupid move, Lyon,

02:30.384 --> 02:32.320
losing it this close
to your release date.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.222
It's a few days. I'll live.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.690
A lot can happen to a man
in a few days.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.559
Especially down here.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.528
(neck cracks)

02:49.237 --> 02:51.171
*

02:55.409 --> 02:59.079
So, the bad news is Andre
ain't coming home for a bit.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.981
But the good news
is we don't have time

03:01.014 --> 03:02.516
to be sad about none of that.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.385
We got work to do.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.855
Now, the Empire that we knew
and love, that's dead.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.558
Now it's time for us
to build an entirely new Empire.

03:10.591 --> 03:14.094
Me and your mama, we found
some office space uptown.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.264
I'm meeting with
some money men later on.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.031
That's gonna shore up
our capital.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.734
COOKIE: And I'm gonna staff
this bitch from the ground up.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.337
See, if we build this company,

03:23.371 --> 03:25.205
then the artists
will come to us.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.374
And we would like to start

03:26.407 --> 03:27.908
with the first two artists
being you two.

03:27.941 --> 03:31.211
We would like for you to sign
with Lyon Family Management.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.113
I mean, you know I'm down,
but there's no way

03:33.146 --> 03:34.615
that Empire's gonna
let y'all just manage us

03:34.648 --> 03:36.884
while we're still
under contract to them.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.386
Well, go ahead.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.055
I've taken the liberty
to go through your contracts.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.692
I want you guys to read them
word for word.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.861
You'll notice
where I've highlighted

03:47.895 --> 03:50.298
individual clauses
that will allow us

03:50.331 --> 03:53.434
to break these contracts
without us being sued.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.936
They ain't gonna let us go
without a fight.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.771
Then we got to do
whatever it takes.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.540
Get busy doing it, 'cause we got

03:59.573 --> 04:01.575
contracts to break
and some money to make.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.144
-Bye, baby. I love you.
-Bye. Love you, too.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.614
Okay, y'all heard him.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.016
(buzzer sounds in distance)

04:15.523 --> 04:18.792
Now, how you gonna
come for me and miss?

04:18.826 --> 04:20.060
When you first got here,

04:20.093 --> 04:21.562
you thought you was so smart,
didn't you?

04:21.595 --> 04:25.098
You should've taken me out
when you had the chance.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.136
(grunts) What the hell?!

04:29.169 --> 04:31.171
You've been eyeballing me
since you got here.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.673
Like you got something
you want to say.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.676
So how about I open your mouth,
so you can say it.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.246
(men shouting)

04:39.279 --> 04:42.583
Here's how it's gonna work
from here on out.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.252
I'm gonna go my way,
and you're gonna go yours.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.088
If you step to me,
I will end you.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.990
You understand me?

04:50.023 --> 04:53.193
-Yeah? Talk to me.
-Ooh.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.195
(chuckles) Little rich girl's
got a pair, y'all.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.298
-Do you understand me?!
-Boy, I understand!

05:06.674 --> 05:08.041
(men murmuring)

05:08.075 --> 05:11.412
MAN:
Yeah, my man surprised him.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.085
Mm. Literature.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.273
(mutters)

05:45.413 --> 05:48.215
* Red wine, sin-stained sheets

05:48.248 --> 05:50.083
* The sound of you...

05:50.117 --> 05:53.186
Come here, help me tie this.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.190
-I need help.
-Okay.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.192
See? All right. See?

06:00.594 --> 06:03.431
-(ringtone playing)
-Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

06:04.532 --> 06:07.000
Oh. Yeah, Chief?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.670
* Right now
at your pleasure... *

06:09.703 --> 06:11.405
(mouths)

06:11.439 --> 06:13.340
When?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.543
Oh, yeah. Emirates nonstop
would be my preference,

06:15.576 --> 06:20.914
but I know that, uh, Bryson will
need a layover in, uh, Paris.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.383
Send a car for me in an hour?

06:23.417 --> 06:25.318
All right.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.858
He needs me to cover
the Sub-Saharan desk.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.960
In Lagos.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.962
* You used to be a good man...

06:34.995 --> 06:36.897
I thought that this
was a home desk job.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.398
Out of all the people around,

06:38.432 --> 06:40.200
they got to have you
dodging bullets in Nigeria?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.069
I've dodged bullets right here
in this very room,

06:42.102 --> 06:43.571
-if you remember.
-Mm.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.105
I can handle myself.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.742
Yeah, you gonna
handle Bryson, too?

06:48.776 --> 06:53.080
* Lately you've been searching *

06:53.113 --> 06:54.715
* Longing for something...

06:54.748 --> 06:57.217
Let's not do that.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.752
There.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.422
Your armor's in place;
now I need to go pack mine.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.161
* I'm-a need ya... *

07:08.195 --> 07:10.397
-I'll call you from Paris.
-Yeah.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.067
* Take me right now
at your pleasure *

07:14.101 --> 07:17.671
* Take me to another level.

07:17.705 --> 07:23.343
Do you expect for us to answer
the phones, collect the mail,

07:23.376 --> 07:27.481
wrangle up your little artists
and keep a schedule for free?

07:27.515 --> 07:32.753
Yes, because I want you all
in this from the ground floor.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.089
Okay, because this is gonna be
bigger than Empire. Trust me.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.126
And I want this built by family,

07:39.159 --> 07:43.196
with family tears, family blood,
family sweat...

07:43.230 --> 07:46.099
-And family reaping
the back end?
-Amen.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.769
Of course. Come on.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.137
Holloway sisters united.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.839
-Okay. Yes.
-Um, look, church finger.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.643
I'm not a Holloway or a Lyon,
so 97% of this speech

07:55.676 --> 07:58.145
ain't got nothing to do
with why I should work for free.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.048
I need you to work A&R.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.816
Can I be head of A&R?

08:02.850 --> 08:06.053
Ain't nobody else in that
department, so yes, of course.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.487
Congratulations. (laughs)

08:07.521 --> 08:09.489
Look at that.
Promotions already.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.560
That's a yes for Porsha.
What about you two heifers?

08:12.593 --> 08:14.061
I want a title.

08:14.094 --> 08:18.699
(sighs) Your title
is "recovering crack ho."

08:18.732 --> 08:20.133
-Ooh!
-(laughs)

08:20.167 --> 08:22.169
* Yeah, ... a dollar bill

08:22.202 --> 08:24.504
* Where them hundreds at?
Blow it like a fan *

08:24.538 --> 08:26.840
-* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
-* Yeah, yeah.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.842
(video game
sound effects playing)

08:28.876 --> 08:32.212
Here. I brought you
Jamal and Hakeem's contracts.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.882
(phone vibrating)

08:34.915 --> 08:38.552
So first, Ludicrous the Lyon
hands me my ass in public,

08:38.586 --> 08:40.921
now his sons want out.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.255
Are you next?

08:42.289 --> 08:45.025
I haven't received
any realistic offers lately.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.694
I need you, Becky.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.596
I need allies around here.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.898
Right this way, please.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.233
Gentlemen, have a seat.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.570
-You up for a game?
-Nah, nah. Let's just get
right to business, yeah?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.338
All right.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.775
Well, just because your father
cut ties with Empire

09:01.809 --> 09:04.177
-doesn't mean that you have to.
-No, I definitely think

09:04.211 --> 09:06.246
that all Lyons need
to make a clean break.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.749
Yeah, you see that physical
impairment clause on page 40?

09:08.782 --> 09:11.685
Who would've thought that
artists read the fine print?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.286
JAMAL: I will complete
all six unfinished songs

09:13.320 --> 09:15.923
on Empire's server,
and then I'm done, too.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.557
All just to help out your dad?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.927
Hey, yo, my dad
don't need no help.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.361
He's actually
right down the street,

09:21.394 --> 09:22.896
making things
better and better for us.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.098
JAMAL: This is about
our family sticking together.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.335
-That's what's important.
-Family?

09:30.570 --> 09:33.641
The three Lyon brothers used
to be the pillars of Empire.

09:33.674 --> 09:37.110
Now one of them's in jail,
and one of them

09:37.144 --> 09:39.246
is reduced to begging
for scraps on behalf

09:39.279 --> 09:40.580
of his daddy's little venture.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.050
And the third,
broken beyond repair.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.818
Who's this lame calling broken?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.053
-(coughs)
-JAMAL: Calm down.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.387
KINGSLEY:
Calm down, little man,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.256
before you cough up
another lung.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.759
Your value is
in your back catalog.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.460
So this version of you

09:53.493 --> 09:55.896
is free to hit the bricks
if you want to.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.031
Go.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.469
And as for you, Jamal,

10:02.502 --> 10:06.674
the album that you owe Empire
must consist of new material,

10:06.707 --> 10:08.008
per your contract.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.911
Yeah. You'll never get one note.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.280
Then you'll never sing again.

10:13.313 --> 10:17.617
Because until I get my album,
your music belongs to me.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.489
LUCIOUS: Welcome to the offices
of Lyon Family Management.

10:22.522 --> 10:24.658
I'll invite you back
two nights from now

10:24.692 --> 10:26.493
to see it in its full glory.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.696
If you've looked over
the portfolio,

10:28.729 --> 10:30.798
you'll see that we can guarantee

10:30.831 --> 10:33.433
to triple your investment
in two years' time.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.435
(chuckles):
That's a pretty bold claim.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.871
LUCIOUS: Well, you know, I've
been at this for 20 years, man.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.474
J.J.: Well, your track record
isn't in artist management.

10:41.508 --> 10:45.713
And due to your well-publicized
financial state,

10:45.746 --> 10:48.048
-you're a credit risk.
-I'm a what?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.717
Look, we all respect Andre,

10:49.750 --> 10:51.885
but frankly
I'm glad he's not here.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.554
Associating with a known felon
is not a good look.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.324
Do you hear yourself, J?
You're a known felon.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.392
I mean, you just got
your ankle monitor off

10:59.426 --> 11:01.494
-from your tax fraud case.
-(man clears throat)

11:05.665 --> 11:08.235
Wow. Oh, I get it.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.037
So you can dust yourself off

11:10.070 --> 11:11.805
after a fall
and reinvent yourself,

11:11.839 --> 11:13.707
but people like me,
I got to stay in my lane.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.042
Is that what y'all are saying?

11:15.075 --> 11:16.343
You're taking this
the wrong way, okay?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.544
You need to calm down
for a second...

11:17.577 --> 11:19.546
No, no, no.
I don't need to calm down.

11:19.579 --> 11:22.082
We've been doing business
for 20 years.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.718
I've always been good on a loan.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.888
Now I've guaranteed y'all
three times your investment

11:27.921 --> 11:29.723
in two years.

11:29.757 --> 11:32.225
This is the part where you
either take it or leave it.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.427
We're gonna leave it, Lucious.

11:37.630 --> 11:42.202
J.J. Are you serious, man?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.910
*

11:58.919 --> 12:00.387
-(sighs)
-So, Cookie, my guy has agreed

12:00.420 --> 12:01.721
to shoot the grand opening.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.623
All I need is a credit card
to reserve.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.959
Yeah, yeah.
Put-put a hold on all of that.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.862
Lucious didn't get the VC money.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.031
Hey, hey, hey.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.566
You okay?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.268
Yeah.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.539
It's just, uh, you know,
Lucious and I,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.642
we got to rethink
some things money-wise.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.778
You know, this has
got to work for us,

12:24.812 --> 12:27.981
because if it doesn't, there is
no starting from square one.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.383
We are at zero.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.552
What else you gonna do,
Cookie, huh?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.554
Sell your kidneys?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.657
You've already given everything
for this man.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.326
Well, not everything.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.661
N-No.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.296
No, Cookie. No.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.732
Now, you told me if you ever
ask, I should shut you down.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.235
Well, I didn't ask yet.
(whispers): Shut your ass up.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.337
And I told you
not to say nothing. She...

12:50.370 --> 12:55.075
Um, excuse me, but this little
secret sound juicy as hell.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.776
-(sighs)
-So you may as well spill it.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.279
I'm all up in it now.
What's happening?

13:01.648 --> 13:04.251
I got a loft in SoHo.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.487
And I got it when I thought
Lucious was gonna run off

13:07.520 --> 13:10.590
with that bitch Giuliana
and give her all my money.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.692
So I convinced her
to buy a loft.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.327
She needed a safety net,

13:14.361 --> 13:16.830
something separate
and apart from Lucious.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.033
And you promised that
you would never tell or sell.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.135
Yeah, well, one out of two
ain't bad.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.604
But Lucious, he doesn't know
about it, right?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.007
-Mm.
-So why don't you just sell it?

13:27.040 --> 13:30.477
Move. I can't breathe. (sighs)

13:30.510 --> 13:34.214
Look, a lot has happened
since I got that loft, okay?

13:34.247 --> 13:35.715
It's a safety net, right?

13:35.748 --> 13:39.419
A safety net is supposed
to catch you when you fall.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.923
And we've fallen.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.493
I need that damn money. Sell it.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.099
*

13:53.901 --> 13:57.070
(Thirsty muttering)

14:05.045 --> 14:08.215
Lookee, lookee. Hey.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.849
Captain Ahab himself.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.852
Chased any white whales lately?

14:12.886 --> 14:16.189
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.325
How you been, partner?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.726
Oh, well, you know,
I'm Gucci, baby.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.494
Now what brings you by?

14:21.528 --> 14:24.031
Seen a couple of my, uh,
ads for the bus benches?

14:24.064 --> 14:26.233
LUCIOUS:
Actually, I saw a bum

14:26.266 --> 14:28.936
wrap himself up with one of them
a couple days ago. (chuckles)

14:28.969 --> 14:30.603
(chuckles)
You got jokes.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.073
I'll have you know, those ads
are doing me just fine.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.241
They made me the number three

14:34.274 --> 14:36.543
Slip-and-Fall Guy
in all of Greenpoint

14:36.576 --> 14:39.012
and the number two #MeToo Guy
in Queens.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.713
So I'm doing fine.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.250
Well, how'd you like to come
back and be my number one

14:43.283 --> 14:47.187
in a new music venture that
we're doing with me and Cookie?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.056
You can bring
your client list, too,

14:49.089 --> 14:51.891
to invest in our new venture.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.626
We can all win.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.629
So let me get this straight.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.565
You don't call me
for, like, a year,

14:58.598 --> 15:01.368
and you think it's all right
you just drop by

15:01.401 --> 15:04.071
-and ask me for my client list?
-Look, man, um,

15:04.104 --> 15:05.738
it ain't never been
like that, Thirst.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.608
No? What's it like?

15:08.641 --> 15:10.710
You know how it was for us, man.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.581
We had our challenges
and, um... but Cookie and I,

15:14.614 --> 15:16.449
we-we're trying to put
the band back together.

15:16.483 --> 15:20.253
So, we would like
for you to help.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.957
(elevator bell dings)

15:23.991 --> 15:27.060
I thought you'd be out slangin'
Henny, celebrating your freedom.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.062
Oh, so I'm supposed
to be at a club

15:29.096 --> 15:31.098
'cause a chump
said I was a loser?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.066
I guess not.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.402
Here's the lyrics to prove it.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.605
I need you to help me with this.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.075
It's beautiful, Keem.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.178
It's dark as hell, but damn.

15:45.212 --> 15:49.082
For months, I could barely
breathe, let alone talk.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.084
But I be having
these crazy dreams

15:51.118 --> 15:52.952
I can't tell nobody about.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.255
But you put it all in here.

15:55.288 --> 15:59.026
There's more where that
came from, if you help me.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.361
(chuckles softly)

16:01.394 --> 16:03.363
What you standing there
for then, boy?

16:03.396 --> 16:05.665
Come on. Let's lay it down.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.634
(exhales)

16:22.049 --> 16:24.217
(whistles)

16:24.251 --> 16:27.187
It's about how
a group of numbers nerds

16:27.220 --> 16:29.489
crack an uncrackable system.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.293
A team of misfits save the day?
Now who's pushing fantasies?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.328
Well, you're smart.
That could be you.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.065
(scoffs) Like I have a future.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.634
You know, Quincy,
most people are who they are,

16:41.668 --> 16:43.703
not what they've done.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.705
Look, I didn't do anything.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.307
(men chattering)

16:47.340 --> 16:49.976
Old, white lady got jacked,
and two days later,

16:50.009 --> 16:52.345
the cops roll up
saying I match the description.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.013
How long?

16:54.047 --> 16:56.249
Five years.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.586
I missed my high school
graduation, so...

16:59.619 --> 17:03.156
I just pretend this is
the worst college ever.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.692
Keep my head down. Keep reading.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.394
You like economics, Quincy?

17:07.427 --> 17:11.164
-I'm a numbers guy, too.
-CFO of Empire.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.999
MBA from Wharton.

17:13.032 --> 17:17.704
Man, I was set up to go straight
there when I got locked up.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.607
Read the book.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.745
* My life flashes,
ahead is my desertion *

17:25.778 --> 17:29.349
* His trigger finger makes me
contemplate if I deser... *

17:29.382 --> 17:31.218
-(coughing)
-(music stops)

17:31.251 --> 17:34.554
Come on, man. Show the beast.
One more time.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.923
-(music resumes)
-* Ahead is my desertion

17:36.956 --> 17:39.626
* His trigger finger makes me
contemplate that I deserve it *

17:39.659 --> 17:42.562
* I'd be damned if my family
would take a hit... *

17:42.595 --> 17:45.698
(coughing)

17:45.732 --> 17:48.067
* Without a purpose...

17:48.101 --> 17:51.304
-(coughs) Hey, yo, Mal,
I can't breathe, man.
-(music stops)

17:51.338 --> 17:53.106
Just, you know, take a second.
All right?

17:53.140 --> 17:55.608
I just took a second!

17:57.944 --> 18:01.281
-Man, come on.
-No.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.450
(elevator bell dings)

18:10.357 --> 18:12.292
*

18:15.828 --> 18:17.730
(coughs)

18:17.764 --> 18:19.132
What up, bro?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.767
What's up?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.735
(sighs)

18:22.769 --> 18:24.637
Yeah, make yourself comfortable.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.307
When does it hit you that
you're living at home, bro?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.742
Like, do Lucious and Cookie,
like, send you to bed

18:29.776 --> 18:32.512
and, like, pack your lunch
in the morning? (laughs)

18:32.545 --> 18:35.315
Shut up.
I want you to see something.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.150
I'm still finishing it up.

18:37.184 --> 18:40.487
If you want it, it's yours.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.056
It's a new song.

18:49.196 --> 18:52.199
-This is about the...
-The shooting.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.600
Why don't you just do it?

18:53.633 --> 18:57.170
Be honest with you,
I can't even breathe right.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.439
My lung all messed up.

18:59.472 --> 19:04.010
But that track right there,
the world need to hear it.

19:04.043 --> 19:06.479
And you went through it.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.981
(scoffs) I don't know
what to say, Keem.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.651
I mean, this is incredible. I...

19:11.684 --> 19:13.720
Yeah.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.223
I'll do it.

19:16.256 --> 19:19.726
I'll do your words justice, bro,
I promise you.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.895
(sighs)

19:22.929 --> 19:25.432
*

19:28.701 --> 19:31.170
(laptop ringing)

19:33.706 --> 19:36.175
(music stops)

19:38.611 --> 19:39.846
(laptop chimes)

19:39.879 --> 19:41.848
Hey, babe. How's Paris?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.416
Just a layover.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.719
Then we do a little piece
in rural Nigeria before Lagos.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.187
How's New York?

19:48.221 --> 19:51.658
Um, Kingsley is holding me
hostage at Empire.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.261
And I think that I killed
the last hope for Hakeem

19:54.294 --> 19:57.063
-to be back to normal.
-(sighs) Sounds tough, my man.

19:57.096 --> 20:01.200
Come hang out with me
when I head to Mogadishu.

20:01.234 --> 20:05.405
(scoffs) That's what
we're gonna do now?

20:05.438 --> 20:07.206
What?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.376
Act like the things I'm talking
about are unimportant

20:09.409 --> 20:11.744
because I'm not running off
chasing civil wars?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.381
I did not mean it like that.

20:14.414 --> 20:17.384
Is that what you think I did?
Run off?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.552
Well, yeah. I mean,
we were starting a life here,

20:19.586 --> 20:21.388
then the first little carrot
that gets dangled

20:21.421 --> 20:23.055
in front of you, you dip out.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.892
Ah, is that what
you're gonna do now? Just...

20:25.925 --> 20:28.395
act like we're starting a life
when what we're really doing

20:28.428 --> 20:31.398
is just... is picking
back up your old one.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.033
That's not true. I told you
that my whole family needed me.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.802
That's why I agreed to stay,

20:35.835 --> 20:39.071
but I-I never said I'd give up
my career because you did.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.476
Bye, babe. Be safe.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.348
(music resumes)

20:53.185 --> 20:55.822
-Hey! Baby boy?
-WOMAN: Excuse me!
You can't just walk in there.

20:55.855 --> 20:59.191
-Man, get your hands off of me.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:00.993 --> 21:04.397
What kind of game
are you playing, man?

21:04.431 --> 21:08.067
Oh. You're upset about the place

21:08.100 --> 21:09.936
that you were
considering leasing?

21:09.969 --> 21:12.339
The place you stole
from under me.

21:12.372 --> 21:16.476
Well, I got some advice for you:
maybe you should tell Hakeem

21:16.509 --> 21:18.645
to stop blabbing your business
in the street.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.180
You know, why are you
so interested

21:21.213 --> 21:24.817
in my family, anyway?

21:24.851 --> 21:28.020
(chuckles):
No, Lucious.

21:28.054 --> 21:31.257
You mistake me.
It's not personal.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.993
I was in a calculus final
my freshman year at Stanford.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.195
The kid next to me,
he breaks his pencil

21:36.228 --> 21:39.666
and asks me
if he can borrow one.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.834
I refused.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.470
If he finishes the test,

21:43.503 --> 21:46.172
he raises the curve
for all of us.

21:46.205 --> 21:49.676
So you think this is
just business, huh?

21:49.709 --> 21:52.679
Look, Empire is growing.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.114
I need more space to record.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.050
Maybe Jamal can record the album
he owes me there.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.152
Look here.

22:00.186 --> 22:03.623
Stronger, hungrier,
more capable men

22:03.656 --> 22:05.124
have come for me.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.360
Every one of them has failed.

22:07.394 --> 22:10.162
Preventing you from starting
a rival venture...

22:10.196 --> 22:12.365
it's not a vendetta, Lucious.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.667
No.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.870
It's a business strategy.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.640
See, you got me mistaken.

22:20.673 --> 22:24.343
Where I come from, we don't play
black eyes and bloody noses,

22:24.377 --> 22:26.546
or schoolyard tits for tats.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.415
It's life or death.

22:28.448 --> 22:33.386
A strategy like yours can
make a man meet his maker.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.187
(laughs)

22:35.221 --> 22:37.724
-I'll see you soon.
-(laughs): Yeah.

22:37.757 --> 22:41.193
Touch me again.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.039
Where are we gonna have
this launch event?

22:53.072 --> 22:54.874
Could you sit down
before you give yourself

22:54.907 --> 22:57.043
-another heart attack?
-I don't think you get it.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.847
I have an event tomorrow
with nowhere to host it.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.282
Hey, what about using
your secret little condo?

23:03.315 --> 23:06.719
Shut your dumb ass up!
Well, can we?

23:06.753 --> 23:09.355
Y'all about to give me whiplash.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.291
First of all, it is not zoned
for commercial use.

23:12.324 --> 23:15.361
So what? So now we care
about some rules?

23:15.394 --> 23:18.631
And I have gotten three offers
since you told me to list it.

23:18.665 --> 23:22.034
-One of them, all cash.
-Get that cash offer.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.036
-Done.
-Yes.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.438
(clears throat)

23:27.006 --> 23:28.641
-Lucious.
-Hey.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.443
You didn't kill Jeff Kingsley,
did you?

23:30.477 --> 23:34.313
Not yet, but he's definitely
on my list.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.583
What's this gathering of
the witches of Eastwick for?

23:36.616 --> 23:39.719
-CANDACE: Oh, please.
-Shut your bum-leg ass up.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.588
We are trying to figure out
where to have this party,

23:41.621 --> 23:43.756
since we've been
kicked to the curb.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.658
You got any bright ideas, nubby?

23:45.692 --> 23:48.327
-(laughs)
-To hell with the dumb stuff.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.397
Why don't we just build it
right here?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.132
In the house?

23:53.165 --> 23:56.836
I mean, this whole company
is about family,

23:56.869 --> 23:58.304
and we got the boys back.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.272
I talked to Thirsty.
I even talked to Becky,

24:00.306 --> 24:02.241
and Becky's talking about
coming back home.

24:02.274 --> 24:06.178
Let's build it
right here at home.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.447
Come on, bro, that's your
best idea? Breathe?

24:08.481 --> 24:10.449
-I can barely get one breath in.
-Okay.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.519
It's because your lyrics
don't allow you to.

24:12.552 --> 24:15.421
You know what I'm saying?
So why not add a breath?

24:15.454 --> 24:18.257
Add shorter lyrics,
more staccato.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.492
You want me to break my verse?

24:19.526 --> 24:21.160
I can't break my verse
like that.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.329
Okay, look, everything that
you wrote is beautiful.

24:23.362 --> 24:26.198
I love it, but you need to
sit that down for a second.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.267
'Cause all that does is
trigger PTSD.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.670
And, look, you know that I know
what I'm talking about.

24:30.703 --> 24:35.708
You got to change the tone,
up here and here.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.409
You feel me?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.013
Look.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.884
This right here is my track.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.386
My track, okay?

24:47.419 --> 24:49.188
(music playing)

24:49.221 --> 24:50.990
I mean, I don't really know
what it's missing,

24:51.023 --> 24:53.660
but it's missing something, and
it might just be missing you.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.361
You know? Look.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.163
I'm no dark poet like you,
but...

24:57.196 --> 24:59.866
(chuckles) Come in
after the hook, 'cause, like...

24:59.899 --> 25:01.868
(vocalizes)

25:01.901 --> 25:04.470
* Feel like
I'm talking foreign *

25:04.503 --> 25:06.573
(vocalizing)

25:07.707 --> 25:09.308
* Uh, really?
I feel the same way *

25:09.341 --> 25:11.043
-* Oh, oh
-* Tryin' to talk to you *

25:11.077 --> 25:12.645
-* You do the same thing
-* Yeah

25:12.679 --> 25:15.014
* You be twisting up my words
like a Backwood *

25:15.047 --> 25:17.817
* Then you try to play the
victim like I knew you would. *

25:17.850 --> 25:19.085
-Mal, this might work.
-(music stops)

25:19.118 --> 25:22.021
Uh, I don't see no cough, son.
Like, what-what?

25:22.054 --> 25:23.723
(both laugh)

25:23.756 --> 25:26.058
-* Whoa, whoa, whoa *
-* Get out the way

25:26.092 --> 25:28.595
-* Get out the way,
get out the way, yeah *
-* Yeah *

25:28.628 --> 25:30.697
* Get out the way,
get the ... up *

25:30.730 --> 25:33.065
-* Out my way, yeah
-* Yeah *

25:33.099 --> 25:37.604
* You either with me
or against me, though *

25:37.637 --> 25:39.505
* You either with me or

25:39.538 --> 25:40.773
-* Wait *
-* Win

25:40.807 --> 25:43.542
-* Win, win, win, win
-* Win. *

25:43.576 --> 25:47.413
It ain't Carol's garage,
but I guess it'll have to do.

25:47.446 --> 25:48.748
(chuckles)

25:48.781 --> 25:51.550
Have to do. I love you.

25:51.584 --> 25:53.385
Mm.

25:53.419 --> 25:56.522
*

25:56.555 --> 25:58.357
THIRSTY:
So, just so you know.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.360
And the woman by the shrimp
cocktails, that's Mabel Watkins,

26:01.393 --> 26:03.195
the Slip-and-Fall Queen.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.031
$3.5 million judgment
against the city.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.033
Never met a sidewalk
she didn't sue.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.567
Mm-hmm. The shrimp cocktail
queen, too.

26:08.601 --> 26:09.802
She been over there
since she got here.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.137
-Stop it.
-(laughs) Let her eat.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.139
She need to leave some
for the guests. We broke.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.876
The dude with the neck brace,
that's, uh, Kenny Simon.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.713
He has a little workman's comp
situation, S&M.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.148
-S&M?
-Worth about 1.4 million.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.450
Now, I told them they can
invest in your company,

26:24.483 --> 26:25.985
they came running.

26:26.018 --> 26:28.254
Uh, tell them to walk,
'cause we don't have insurance.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.623
-Hi.
-Mm. Hey.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.458
(chuckles) Hey.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.560
-Hey. Hey, Becky.
-Hi.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.163
-Hey, you.
-Thank you for making it.

26:37.196 --> 26:42.001
Well, I didn't think I had a
choice; you called me 110 times.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.003
(Lucious laughs)

26:44.036 --> 26:46.438
Well, okay.

26:46.472 --> 26:47.974
(music fades out)

26:48.007 --> 26:51.277
Well, first and foremost, I
would like to welcome everyone

26:51.310 --> 26:55.281
to the Lyon Family Management
first event.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.918
I couldn't imagine being
at a happier place

26:58.951 --> 27:01.153
than I am right here at home,

27:01.187 --> 27:03.355
because this is
where it all began.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.357
-Then...
-Wait. This is it?

27:05.391 --> 27:08.127
This is the whole company?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.596
I didn't come here
to invest in no living room.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.165
Excuse me, Weezy Jefferson.

27:13.199 --> 27:17.336
You've been, uh, aggressive
with my shrimp cocktail,

27:17.369 --> 27:19.338
a little too much to waltz
your ass up out of here.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.208
So I'm gonna need you
to sit your ass down

27:22.241 --> 27:24.310
and let this man finish.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.945
And then go easy on the shrimp,

27:25.978 --> 27:28.480
'cause other people here
want to eat.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.149
-MABEL: Mm-hmm.
-Thank you, Cookie.

27:30.182 --> 27:33.720
Uh, Mrs. Watkins,
I'm sure you can understand

27:33.753 --> 27:36.188
the passion that my wife has.

27:36.222 --> 27:40.459
Our entire business started
in a living room just like this.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.961
Went on to take over
the streets,

27:41.994 --> 27:44.396
and next thing you know,
we took over the entire world.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.898
COOKIE:
That's right.

27:45.932 --> 27:48.000
Now, a very wise woman once said

27:48.034 --> 27:52.471
that the greatest asset
that Empire had

27:52.504 --> 27:54.841
all had the last name Lyon.

27:56.008 --> 27:59.712
I want to demonstrate that.
Jamal.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.714
Actually, little brother
is gonna lead this one.

28:01.748 --> 28:05.017
Nah. Nah, man, no.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.819
JAMAL:
It's fine. He's ready.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.821
You got it. Listen.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.656
You can do it.
You can do it.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.158
-(mouthing)
-He's fine.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.425
You can do it, baby.

28:13.459 --> 28:14.994
-Go ahead.
-Hey, look.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.529
It's just like we practiced.
You got this.

28:17.563 --> 28:19.198
-My lung, bro.
-You got it.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.500
-Is he ready?
-Uh...

28:21.533 --> 28:23.035
JAMAL:
Prince Hakeem.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.274
(chuckles)
Come on, man. Kill it.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.441
-* Yeah
-(music begins)

28:29.475 --> 28:31.110
-* First things first
-* Okay

28:31.143 --> 28:33.412
-* I think you be really
acting immature *
-* Say what?

28:33.445 --> 28:36.182
-* I think you be blowing this
out of proportion *
-* That's you *

28:36.215 --> 28:38.785
* I think you be making
worse things worse *

28:38.818 --> 28:42.955
* I feel like
I'm talking foreign *

28:42.989 --> 28:45.858
-* Telling you
something important *
-* What you tell 'em, bro? *

28:45.892 --> 28:49.061
* But you take my words
and ignore 'em, no *

28:49.095 --> 28:50.963
-* Really? I feel the same way
-* Oh

28:50.997 --> 28:54.033
-* Tryin' to talk to you,
you do the same thing *
-* No, I don't *

28:54.066 --> 28:55.968
* You be twisting up my words
like a Backwood *

28:56.002 --> 28:58.204
* Then you try to play the
victim like I knew you would *

28:58.237 --> 28:59.538
-* I'm a mess *
-* I'm a mess? *

28:59.571 --> 29:01.140
-* You a mess
-* You a mess

29:01.173 --> 29:03.042
-* And we both gotta
give this here a rest *
-* Yeah

29:03.075 --> 29:05.244
* All we do is point
the blame, right? *

29:05.277 --> 29:06.478
* Point the blame, right?

29:06.512 --> 29:08.280
* We're both yelling
at the same time *

29:08.314 --> 29:12.051
* You don't hear me, you don't
hear me, you don't hear me *

29:12.084 --> 29:14.821
-* You don't hear me
like I want you to *
-* Nah

29:14.854 --> 29:17.824
* Be quiet, we both yelling
at the same time *

29:17.857 --> 29:19.625
-* I'm a mess *
-* I'm a mess? *

29:19.658 --> 29:21.227
-* You a mess
-* You a mess

29:21.260 --> 29:23.295
-* And we both gotta
give this here a rest *
-* Yeah

29:23.329 --> 29:26.132
-* All we do is point
the blame, right? *
-* Point the blame, right?

29:26.165 --> 29:27.934
* We both yelling
at the same time *

29:27.967 --> 29:32.104
* You don't hear me, you don't
hear me, you don't hear me *

29:32.138 --> 29:34.773
-* You don't hear me
like I want you to *
-* Nah

29:34.807 --> 29:38.610
* Be quiet, we both yelling
at the same time. *

29:38.644 --> 29:41.013
-(music ends)
-(cheering)

29:41.047 --> 29:44.951
-Yes! How you like that, Weezy?
-I'm loving it!

29:44.984 --> 29:46.819
Have all the shrimp you want.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.491
I told you.

29:52.524 --> 29:53.826
-Did we do that?
-We did that.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.995
-We did that. Give it to me.
-(laughing)

29:56.028 --> 29:57.463
We did that.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.698
Yes. But it's not what
those venture capitalists

29:59.731 --> 30:01.267
would've given us.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.469
-But it's okay, we'll take it.
-You know what?

30:03.502 --> 30:04.937
The hell with them
white boys, man.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.974
Them the same fools that
undervalued me in the beginning.

30:08.007 --> 30:12.011
Said I wouldn't sell one album.
I sold 100 million albums.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.981
They said that a man like me
couldn't run a company.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.116
Man, I ran my company
straight to Wall Street.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.617
Man, I built Empire.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.620
And I'm gonna do it again,
'cause that's what I do.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.056
(chuckles):
That's what I do, baby.

30:24.090 --> 30:27.159
-We do.
-Well, you know what I meant.

30:27.193 --> 30:29.028
(chuckles) We did it.

30:29.061 --> 30:31.663
-We did it.
-Becky. Thanks for coming, Mama.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.665
-Yeah.
-You look amazing.

30:33.699 --> 30:35.367
We did it, baby.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.470
Okay, so I can't even be snarky.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.807
That was really amazing.
I'm really excited for you.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.510
Thank you.
Now, when you quitting?

30:44.543 --> 30:47.679
-Quit?
-Yeah. I need you here.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.481
You expect me to give up my job?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.151
Kingsley's about to promote me.
I'm not gonna quit.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.552
Kingsley's my enemy.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.389
How you gonna be loyal to me...
working with Kingsley?

30:57.423 --> 31:02.028
Loyalty is what, choosing you
over my career? Are you serious?

31:02.061 --> 31:04.897
You wouldn't even have a career
if it wasn't for me, Becky.

31:04.931 --> 31:08.935
Because you gave me one job,
just one job, an assistant job,

31:08.968 --> 31:11.170
and then you repeatedly
looked me over after that.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.672
Any promotion I got
had nothing to do with you.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.507
Am I supposed to have
undying loyalty for you?

31:15.541 --> 31:18.610
That's what loyalty is!
It's-it's unconditional!

31:18.644 --> 31:20.879
Undivided. Unswerving.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.915
It's ride or die, Becky.
If you don't know that,

31:22.949 --> 31:26.018
what the hell are you doing
in my house? Honestly.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.619
Leaving. Honestly.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.489
-Get the hell out my house.
I don't need you.
-Bye.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.260
(door opens, closes)

31:40.299 --> 31:42.434
Are you okay?
Is something wrong, Cook?

31:42.468 --> 31:43.535
Mm-mm.

31:43.569 --> 31:44.903
-CANDACE: You feeling all right?
-Yes.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.805
We need to take
your blood pressure.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.407
It's not like that.

31:48.440 --> 31:53.912
Uh, Candace, did the sale
to the condo go through yet?

31:53.946 --> 31:58.117
I haven't formally accepted.
Why?

31:58.150 --> 32:01.253
Uh... Well, I just, um,

32:01.287 --> 32:04.456
I-I don't think
it's a good time now, you know?

32:04.490 --> 32:06.892
I can put a pause in it.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.128
You want me to take it
off the market?

32:09.161 --> 32:12.098
Yeah. Yes.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.400
Yeah. Thanks.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.934
Why? Why are you doing this?

32:15.968 --> 32:18.070
Why are you changing your mind
about needing a safety net?

32:18.104 --> 32:20.306
What happened?
Did Lucious do something?

32:20.339 --> 32:24.010
No. Oh, come on. You know
it's ride or die with us.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.678
It's just, you know,
I've been thinking,

32:26.712 --> 32:31.183
and it's what Candace always
says about real estate is that

32:31.217 --> 32:34.320
it always appreciates,
so I just think it's silly

32:34.353 --> 32:37.423
to sell it right now
with all that's going on.

32:37.456 --> 32:41.460
So... You know, you never know
what could happen. (sighs)

32:41.493 --> 32:44.330
A.C. might go out again.
Why are y'all looking like that?

32:44.363 --> 32:47.099
-* You don't hear me *
-* You don't hear me *

32:47.133 --> 32:48.867
* You don't hear me
like I want you to *

32:48.900 --> 32:51.003
-* Nah
-* Be quiet

32:51.037 --> 32:53.605
-* We both yelling
at the same time. *
-(music stops)

32:53.639 --> 32:55.807
I have fulfilled
my contractual obligation.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.477
You've outdone yourself
on this one.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.847
Oh, this'll be the lead single.
There's nine more just like it.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.982
Should we talk release dates?

33:04.016 --> 33:05.517
Yeah, but before we do that,

33:05.551 --> 33:07.786
you might want to call up
your accounting department.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.157
You're gonna have to cut
a lot of checks to my family.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.691
Every song on the album,

33:12.724 --> 33:14.860
including the one that you just
heard, samples a Lyon on it,

33:14.893 --> 33:17.996
so you'll have to cut
royalty checks for every sale,

33:18.030 --> 33:20.166
every performance,
every use, forever.

33:20.199 --> 33:23.402
-Samples can be stripped out.
-Mm-mm. Not mine.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.970
Check my contract.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.473
I have full creative control
over my music.

33:27.506 --> 33:31.510
So go ahead, release the album.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.679
Lyons gonna count our coins.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.319
-(intercom beeps)
-LINDA: Yes, sir?

33:40.352 --> 33:43.489
Linda, I need you to arrange
a visit for me.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.624
-Sure.
-To a correctional facility.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.102
Hey, Andre.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.070
You all right?

33:59.471 --> 34:01.607
(door opens)

34:06.112 --> 34:08.046
Hey.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.619
You have to stay strong, baby.

34:13.652 --> 34:17.089
We're gonna get you out of here.
You understand?

34:17.123 --> 34:18.390
Yes, Mom.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.792
Yo, Quincy.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.628
-For the eye. man.
-We're fine.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.063
-Thank you.
-Well, I'm not trying
to cause no trouble,

34:25.097 --> 34:26.465
you know, I just want
to help him.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.000
Thank you. I'm talking
to my son now. Thank you.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.074
Don't you take a damn thing
from those people.

34:38.310 --> 34:39.811
LUCIOUS:
How you doing, son?

34:39.845 --> 34:42.481
I'm holding up, Pop.
How are you?

34:42.514 --> 34:44.150
-You good?
-I'm good, but you know

34:44.183 --> 34:46.452
you gonna have to give me
something more than

34:46.485 --> 34:47.986
"I'm holding up, Pop."

34:48.019 --> 34:50.589
You know, your mama
wants a complete dossier.

34:50.622 --> 34:54.160
Tell Ma don't worry, you know,
I'm doing my time in peace.

34:54.193 --> 34:57.163
Yeah, it's hard,
though, man. We...

34:57.196 --> 34:59.965
I just... I feel responsible

34:59.998 --> 35:02.601
'cause I told you
to protect the family,

35:02.634 --> 35:04.970
-and it got you up in here.
-Pop, Pop, Pop.

35:05.003 --> 35:08.006
I don't blame you
for speaking truth, Pop.

35:08.039 --> 35:12.010
And, if anything, you know,
this place is good for me.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.281
Come again?

35:15.314 --> 35:17.949
-Explain that.
-Well, you sent me to Wharton

35:17.983 --> 35:20.118
to learn how
the business world operates.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.223
And now I'm here learning
how the street operates.

35:26.158 --> 35:30.028
With that combination,
I'll be unstoppable, Pop.

35:30.061 --> 35:34.300
See, I've learned to allow
people to underestimate me,

35:34.333 --> 35:36.768
think they got me boxed in.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.804
And that's the moment I strike.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.473
No warning, no threats.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.975
Pure annihilation.

35:49.581 --> 35:52.284
It's time.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.220
Get it done.

36:03.529 --> 36:06.031
Find someplace else
to look, boy.

36:07.699 --> 36:11.703
Who knows? Maybe you'll like it.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.939
(men grunting)

36:17.108 --> 36:18.244
Hold him up!

36:20.546 --> 36:22.180
Get him up, get him up.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.856
(Gusto gagging)

36:41.867 --> 36:44.236
MAN (over P.A.): We got an
inmate down, D-Block rec room.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.871
Repeat, inmate down.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.874
MATTHEW (in distance):
Hey, what's going on out there?

36:48.907 --> 36:51.042
(alarm blaring in distance)

36:51.076 --> 36:52.978
You want a souvenir?

37:00.118 --> 37:01.587
(Andre chuckles softly)

37:03.489 --> 37:06.292
Give it to one of his apostles.

37:06.325 --> 37:10.161
Aw, you ain't no good.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.303
MATTHEW (in distance):
No! What have you done?!

37:17.336 --> 37:19.471
(Matthew continues shouting
in distance)

37:19.505 --> 37:21.673
*

37:32.250 --> 37:34.085
(phone vibrates)

37:36.187 --> 37:38.156
(laptop ringing)

37:43.094 --> 37:45.931
Hey, Jamal, I have, uh, a couple
of my friends here with me,

37:45.964 --> 37:48.233
and they want to give you a
little performance. Y'all ready?

37:48.266 --> 37:51.403
Yeah, warm 'em up, warm 'em up.
You know it. There you go.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.605
All right. Enjoy.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.474
One, two, three, go.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.743
ALL:
* You're so beautiful *

37:57.776 --> 37:59.311
* Shake it, shake it and

37:59.345 --> 38:01.480
* I don't care who knows *

38:01.513 --> 38:03.682
* Move it, move it, go up, down,
up, down, up, down *

38:03.715 --> 38:05.484
* Go up, down,
up, down, up, uh-huh *

38:05.517 --> 38:06.818
* Go up, down, up, down

38:06.852 --> 38:09.154
* Up, down, go up, down,
up, down, up, down *

38:09.187 --> 38:11.089
* Go up, down,
up, down, up, down *

38:11.122 --> 38:13.825
* Go up, down, up, down,
up, down, shake it fast. *

38:13.859 --> 38:16.428
-(chuckles)
-KAI: Kids, say hi
to Jamal Lyon.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.930
KIDS:
Hi!

38:18.964 --> 38:21.199
Hi, everybody. I love you.

38:21.232 --> 38:23.835
So you just gonna take
all those beautiful children,

38:23.869 --> 38:25.504
try to get back on my good side?

38:25.537 --> 38:27.939
-(boy chatters)
-(chuckles)

38:27.973 --> 38:30.676
-Well, did it work?
-Course it did.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.645
One more week,
and I will be back by your side.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.815
Yeah, I'm-a hold you to that.

38:36.848 --> 38:39.651
KAI: One more time, guys.
One, two, three, four.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.653
ALL:
* You're so beautiful *

38:41.687 --> 38:43.321
-(boy shouts happily)
-* Shake it, shake it

38:43.355 --> 38:45.657
-* I don't care who knows. *
-(laughs)

38:45.691 --> 38:48.226
BLAKE:
* My life flashes

38:48.259 --> 38:50.028
* Ahead is my desertion

38:50.061 --> 38:52.864
* His trigger finger makes me
contemplate if I deserve it *

38:52.898 --> 38:55.033
* I'd be damned if my family *

38:55.066 --> 38:57.636
* Would take the hit,
so be a man and step in front *

38:57.669 --> 38:59.505
* Of this angry man
without a... *

38:59.538 --> 39:00.839
Wow.

39:00.872 --> 39:04.643
-What's that?
-Hi. Uh, nothing. It's nothing.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.912
Nothing?
Doesn't sound like nothing.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.647
-(chuckles)
-Go play, baby.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.483
Stay close so I can see you.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.819
I really appreciate you
watching Prince.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.487
What are you working on?

39:15.521 --> 39:17.856
-Was it about the shooting?
-Yeah.

39:17.889 --> 39:21.092
-I could stop if it bothers you.
-No, no, come on.

39:21.126 --> 39:25.230
Come on. What you wrote,
that's how it felt.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.901
I still relive it every day,
you know.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.870
Me, too.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.841
If Hakeem could just put out

39:35.874 --> 39:38.710
his emotions on the page
like you did,

39:38.744 --> 39:41.046
maybe he wouldn't be so...

39:43.114 --> 39:44.983
I should go.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.255
Come over for dinner.

39:50.288 --> 39:51.957
What, you cooking?

39:51.990 --> 39:54.259
-I have some prepared meals.
-Oh.

39:54.292 --> 39:57.295
-I can't cook to save my life.
-Oh, you know,

39:57.328 --> 39:59.565
-I could chef it up
a little bit. Yeah.
-Oh, really? Okay.

39:59.598 --> 40:02.801
Just don't let your mouth
write checks you can't cash.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.870
Come on, none of that.
I'm a good cook, for real.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.072
We'll see. Come on, baby.
(chuckles)

40:07.105 --> 40:09.307
-You ready? 'Sup, little man?
-Ready?

40:09.340 --> 40:11.309
-Let's go get some dinner.
-Hey, Bella.

40:11.342 --> 40:14.813
'Sup, Bella?
All right, I'm following you.

40:14.846 --> 40:18.016
-All right. Okay.
-You got groceries, right?

40:27.325 --> 40:29.495
Wait here. I'll get the inmate.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.497
Much appreciated.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.807
You made it out
in one piece, Lyon.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.441
More than we can say for Gusto.

40:43.475 --> 40:45.644
I'm guessing that
the warden doesn't like

40:45.677 --> 40:49.581
that his number one suspect
has a rock solid alibi.

40:49.615 --> 40:52.317
I've got some packing to do.
I'm going home.

40:52.350 --> 40:55.721
Not yet. You got a visitor.

41:05.997 --> 41:09.434
Oh, you're Quincy's mom.
Um, I think they made a mistake.

41:09.467 --> 41:13.338
No, I...
I'm here to see you, Andre.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.675
I'm Teri.

41:25.851 --> 41:28.787
Hey.

41:28.820 --> 41:32.390
It kills me not to be able
to protect my son in there.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.628
I pray for him every day.

41:36.662 --> 41:39.497
And now, thank God,

41:39.531 --> 41:42.534
that bastard
can't hurt him anymore.

41:44.035 --> 41:45.671
Yeah, I heard that.

41:45.704 --> 41:51.076
He said you had your guys
handle this.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.980
Why'd you do that?

41:55.013 --> 41:58.750
I didn't say I did.

41:58.784 --> 42:01.286
I want to say thank you.

42:02.788 --> 42:06.725
You're a good, good man.

42:10.862 --> 42:13.031
I don't know about that.

42:13.064 --> 42:15.266
I do.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.241
*

42:34.452 --> 42:37.422
I really appreciate
your agreeing to meet with me.

42:37.455 --> 42:40.626
I've denied most requests.

42:40.659 --> 42:42.861
Mostly they've been
from tabloid reporters

42:42.894 --> 42:46.031
who want to paint me as some
modern day Marquise de Merteuil.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.734
Les Liaisons dangereuses.

42:48.767 --> 42:50.468
Please.

42:50.501 --> 42:53.038
You are so much more
formidable than that.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.974
(chuckles) Hmm.

42:56.007 --> 42:58.443
(both laugh)

42:58.476 --> 42:59.911
It's been a long time

42:59.945 --> 43:03.181
since a young handsome man
has tried to flatter me.

43:05.684 --> 43:07.452
You must want something.

43:07.485 --> 43:11.256
You know the expression, "The
enemy of my enemy is my friend"?

43:11.289 --> 43:14.726
Few people know
that that is actually

43:14.760 --> 43:16.795
an ancient Sanskrit proverb.

43:16.828 --> 43:19.330
From fourth century BCE.

43:22.500 --> 43:25.671
Let's just say I think we're
going to be very good friends.

Media Access Group at WGBH

Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:15.854 --> 44:16.855
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:19.190 --> 44:21.526
It's real, and it pulls
