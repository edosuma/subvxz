WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.903
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.936 --> 00:07.007
Rebecca.
Matt Dickson from the PTA.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.243
-Do you want
to get coffee with me?
-Yeah.

00:09.277 --> 00:10.911
My manager said if I'm gonna
take acting serious,

00:10.944 --> 00:12.246
I got to be
in L.A. pretty regularly.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.647
So, what,
you're just gonna, like,

00:13.681 --> 00:15.683
constantly be in L.A.
while I'm in New York?

00:15.716 --> 00:17.251
How is this marriage gonna work?

00:17.285 --> 00:18.852
I reached out
to a job recruiter.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.489
She got back to me with listings

00:21.522 --> 00:23.324
from some traditional
dance conservatories.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.825
These dance academies

00:24.858 --> 00:26.760
took something I love

00:26.794 --> 00:28.262
and made it joyless.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.863
VINCENT:
We're gonna learn
the new combination.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.432
Sonya here will demonstrate.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.935
Go in there
and do what you always do.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.937
Blow us all away.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.839
("The Sun" by Burning Spear
playing)

00:38.872 --> 00:41.509
-* So when the sun goes down *
-(laughing)

00:41.542 --> 00:44.778
* And we move along *

00:44.812 --> 00:46.680
* I will call... *

00:46.714 --> 00:49.583
-BETH: Daddy,
tell me the story again.
-ABE: Hmm.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.352
-Again?
-BETH: Please,

00:51.385 --> 00:54.855
-Daddy?
-We were right here in Kingston.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.459
You were 18 months
and hadn't walked at all.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.728
Your mother
was worried to death.

01:00.761 --> 01:04.198
But then we were all at a party

01:04.232 --> 01:06.967
for your Uncle Clem
at Hellshire Beach.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.138
He said,
"The girl must know good music."

01:10.171 --> 01:12.640
And he put on Burning Spear,

01:12.673 --> 01:14.542
and just like that,

01:14.575 --> 01:16.710
it took hold
of those little legs of yours

01:16.744 --> 01:18.078
and picked you right up
off the ground.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.381
You danced straight to me.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.983
And right then, you became

01:23.016 --> 01:26.987
-my little island girl
who danced...
-Who danced before she walked.

01:27.020 --> 01:30.524
That's right.
(chuckles)

01:31.925 --> 01:34.462
You've always done things
in your own time,

01:34.495 --> 01:35.929
baby girl.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.333
LINDA:
We have

01:39.367 --> 01:41.335
eight studios on the premises,

01:41.369 --> 01:44.172
and most of them
have classes going all day.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.575
-I'll get you a map.
-A map. Wow. (chuckles)

01:47.608 --> 01:49.577
Two, three...

01:49.610 --> 01:51.745
*

01:51.779 --> 01:54.582
Two, three, four...

01:54.615 --> 01:56.517
I'm so pleased
we're moving forward

01:56.550 --> 01:59.320
with your idea
for a scholarship program.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.923
I know it wasn't easy convincing
the board of directors.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.993
Thank you.
Twisted some arms so hard,

02:06.026 --> 02:07.695
-I almost broke 'em, but, uh...
-(chuckles softly)

02:07.728 --> 02:11.031
I just really believe
there's a lot of untapped talent

02:11.064 --> 02:13.301
that could really thrive here.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.937
I trust you'll find them.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.639
Welcome aboard.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.983
-(knock on door)
-RANDALL: How's it going?

02:30.017 --> 02:33.721
Not good, baby. Not good.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.825
I have over 200 applicants
and only 15 spots.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.960
The fate of this whole program

02:39.993 --> 02:41.995
rests on me choosing
the right dancers.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.497
(sighs)

02:45.499 --> 02:47.468
All you have to do,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.670
turn off this.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.372
Trust this.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.873
My belly?

02:52.906 --> 02:54.375
That's just telling me
to stress-eat

02:54.408 --> 02:55.676
those Thai dumplings
in the fridge.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.846
No, silly. Your gut.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.749
It's never steered you wrong.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.351
(indistinct chatter)

03:03.384 --> 03:05.018
BETH:
Now, if you're accepted,

03:05.052 --> 03:06.920
we'll cover the cost of tuition,

03:06.954 --> 03:08.989
competition fees
and pointe shoes.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.892
That's amazing. I go through,
like, two pairs a week.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.994
I practically live
at the studio.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.929
JOSEPH: Uh, she'll have
to keep up with her studies.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.265
That's most important.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.701
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.871
-Let me show you
a few more studios.
-STACEY: Okay.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.673
BETH:
Congratulations, everyone.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.008
You made it. Now, most of you

03:28.041 --> 03:30.344
haven't trained at this level
at your old dance studios.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.947
Right?
This space can be intimidating.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.183
Don't worry. They got maps.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.186
-(students chuckle)
-But I want you to remember

03:39.219 --> 03:40.854
that you belong.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.924
So take up space. Yes?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.461
Now, you'll have an opportunity

03:47.495 --> 03:50.464
to demonstrate your hard work
at our fall showcase,

03:50.498 --> 03:53.534
which could lead
to an apprenticeship

03:53.567 --> 03:55.603
with
a professional dance company.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.970
-(students murmur)
-Okay?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.906
So, now I want you all
to turn around

03:58.939 --> 04:00.774
and face the mirror

04:00.808 --> 04:03.277
and repeat after me.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.881
I can, and I will.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.751
STUDENTS:
I can, and I will.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.421
Again. I can, and I will.

04:13.454 --> 04:17.157
STUDENTS:
I can, and I will.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.192
*

04:27.034 --> 04:29.970
She's not as polished
as our other soloists.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.540
I don't think she'll be ready
for the showcase.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.676
She'll be ready.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.778
Trust me.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.914
Okay.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.916
I will.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.753
ABE:
You're one of a kind, baby girl.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.356
Don't ever forget
how special you are.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.495
(Stacey sighs)

04:59.700 --> 05:01.702
*

05:06.306 --> 05:08.509
I don't understand why we had
to go food shopping so early.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.210
I mean, Thanksgiving's
not for three days.

05:10.243 --> 05:13.481
So, the key to a successful
Thanksgiving is to strike early.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.016
See, you learn that once you've
had to tussle with an old lady

05:16.049 --> 05:18.018
in aisle three over the last can
of cranberry sauce.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.720
-Oh.
-SOPHIE: I can't wait

05:19.753 --> 05:22.790
until Kev and I get
to host Thanksgiving one day.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.626
In our amazing loft
with exposed brick

05:25.659 --> 05:26.894
that we'll buy

05:26.927 --> 05:29.162
when Kevin becomes
a famous actor.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.831
Right, babe?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.834
So, we got three kinds
of stuffing and no extra beer?

05:33.867 --> 05:37.571
Wow, are we that unbearable
to be around? Got to be drunk

05:37.605 --> 05:39.139
-to hang out with us?
-(door opens)
-Ha ha.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.808
-I didn't buy it at all.
-(laughs): Well, then, next time

05:40.841 --> 05:43.343
-you can choose the movie. Oh!
-(Matt laughs)

05:44.745 --> 05:46.847
Guys. I didn't know

05:46.880 --> 05:49.182
that anyone was gonna be home.
(chuckles) Hi.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.918
-You got in early!
-Hi.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.186
-REBECCA: Hi. Hey, sweetheart.
-Hey.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.688
-How you doing?
-REBECCA: Oh, I'm good.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.157
-Oh. (chuckles)
-KEVIN: What's up?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.893
Oh! Sorry. (chuckles)
Now I'm all flustered.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.362
Uh, um, guys, this is Matt.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.899
Matt, this is Kate and Kevin.
Um, Kevin's wife Sophie.

06:05.933 --> 06:09.336
-Hi.
-And then my other son Randall
and his girlfriend are in D.C.,

06:09.369 --> 06:10.838
but-but he'll be here
for Thanksgiving.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.005
-Oh, great.
-Yeah.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.674
Oh, and this is, uh, Miguel.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.175
-Hey.
-REBECCA: A good family friend.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.677
Hey. Matt Dickson.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.712
-MIGUEL: Hey, Matt.
Pleasure. Yeah.
-Hi.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.614
Hey, I picked up the turkey
for our three-day brine.

06:20.648 --> 06:24.351
Oh. Thank you. Yeah, uh,
Miguel and I saw Emeril do it,

06:24.384 --> 06:26.019
and we just thought,
"Eh, you know, what the heck?"

06:26.053 --> 06:27.555
Yeah. We were like, "Brine not?"

06:27.588 --> 06:31.358
REBECCA (laughing):
"Brine not?"

06:31.391 --> 06:34.227
(chuckles)
I-I love a good brine. You know.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.697
But since the divorce, I've just
been keeping things low-key.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.032
You know, just me
and my Hungry-Man.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.101
(Kate and Matt chuckle)

06:43.571 --> 06:45.439
You know,
you're welcome to join us.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.941
Oh, no. Look,
I-I don't want to impose.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.310
Oh, come on. I insist.
(chuckles)

06:50.343 --> 06:52.312
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:52.345 --> 06:55.315
Well, in that case, I'm bringing
my famous pumpkin pie.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.317
-ALL: Oh!
-MATT (chuckles): Yeah.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.487
It's not famous at all.
It's from the grocery store.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.988
-REBECCA: Oh.
-Lucky for you all.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.790
(all chuckle)

07:02.823 --> 07:05.793
Um... Well, uh,
nice to meet you all.

07:05.826 --> 07:09.096
-Yeah. Bye. (clears throat)
-Bye.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.164
(door opens)

07:12.666 --> 07:14.234
(door closes)

07:14.267 --> 07:17.605
(groans) Well, this isn't
gonna be awkward at all.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.673
Can't wait.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.080
-Kevin, it's so nice of you
to do all of this.
-KEVIN: No problem.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.950
Are you kidding? The eggs are
warming, the kids are sleeping,

07:29.983 --> 07:32.319
and the next batch
of red velvet waffles

07:32.352 --> 07:34.922
will be ready
in T-minus four minutes.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.124
You know what we should do?
We should make a thing of this.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.827
Right? We could call it, um,
Brunch and Beauties.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.129
'Cause I feel
like we're beautiful people.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.131
-Uh...
-Eh.
-KEVIN: Brunch and Beauties. No?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.966
We don't...? Okay, well, you
know, we'll pitch on it later.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.168
Kevin's trying to show that
he's supportive that I'm dating.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.003
Yeah, I know. It's really cute

07:50.037 --> 07:51.605
-when he tries
to make it look natural.
-MADISON: Mm-hmm.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.174
Elijah, these blueberry muffins
are insane.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.109
-Really, they're from scratch?
-Yeah.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.378
I'm kind of a baked goods snob.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.313
It's homemade or bust
for this guy.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.815
-(chuckles)
-Well, maybe you can whip up
another batch

08:01.849 --> 08:03.517
-for me to take to Thanksgiving.
-Sure.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.286
Madison, you are gonna love
Thanksgiving at the cabin,

08:06.319 --> 08:08.622
by the way. And I can't wait
for the twins to see me

08:08.656 --> 08:09.823
in the Pilgrim Rick hat.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.559
Although I do hope
it doesn't scare Nicky,

08:11.592 --> 08:13.026
because he gets really weird
around hats.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.299
Uh, well, what about you?
You got plans for the holidays?

08:19.332 --> 08:22.570
Oh. Um... Well, you know,

08:22.603 --> 08:24.304
it's probably just gonna be
a quiet one with the family.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.073
-KEVIN: Hmm.
-Hey, is that beauty

08:26.106 --> 08:28.676
-yours?
-Yeah. Yes, she is.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.511
This is a Gibson J-45.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.013
This is the guitar
that Bradley Cooper used

08:33.046 --> 08:34.481
-in A Star Is Born.
-(strums chord)

08:34.514 --> 08:35.849
I'm just kind of
getting the hang of it.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.517
Yeah, that sounds great, man.
You're a rock star.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.319
Yeah. Well, I've been taking

08:39.352 --> 08:40.721
Springsteen's
online MasterClass,

08:40.754 --> 08:42.155
-so...
-TOBY: Mm-hmm.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.657
You aren't talking to me at all,
are you?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.325
-Mm. Work call.
-KEVIN: Yeah.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.260
These are insane. Are these you?

08:47.294 --> 08:49.162
-Yeah.
-I love you. (kisses)

08:49.196 --> 08:50.530
No, not you, sir.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.499
-Talking to a man named Elijah.
-(chuckles)

08:52.532 --> 08:54.702
He's doing a deal
in two different time zones,

08:54.735 --> 08:56.336
so, like, eight of the 16 hours

08:56.369 --> 08:58.105
that he's been back?
It's been that.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.240
I never thought that I would
get jealous of AirPods.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.842
-MADISON: Aw.
-KATE: Yeah.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.843
I thought
that his ears were mine

09:02.876 --> 09:04.044
once we said our vows, but...

09:04.077 --> 09:06.379
Well, listen,
you don't have to come

09:06.413 --> 09:08.081
to the-the pilot taping
of The Manny tomorrow.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.683
Why don't you spend
some quality time with Toby?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.551
Are you kidding?
It's not every day

09:11.585 --> 09:13.020
that our brother gets to star

09:13.053 --> 09:15.088
in a reboot of a show
that made his career

09:15.122 --> 09:16.389
and then almost cost him
his career.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.925
-We're gonna be there.
-Okay.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.727
-All right. All right.
-ELIJAH: Oh, man.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.429
That all sounds so exciting.
The live audience and all.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.531
Well, why don't you and Madison
come? Come to the taping.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.299
-Seriously?
-KEVIN: Yes.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.301
-Be great.
-Okay.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.469
-Yeah.
-Great! Terrific.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.071
-Yes.
-Now,

09:31.104 --> 09:34.541
-let Brunch 'N' Stuff begin.
-MADISON: I like it.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.809
-Brunch 'N' Stuff.
-MADISON: Yeah.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.544
-All right.
-Better.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.647
All right, well, we're getting
there. We're getting there.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.317
(gasps) We have to get
the bread pudding.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.786
My dad and I

09:45.819 --> 09:47.120
used to come here sometimes,

09:47.154 --> 09:50.123
and we'd skip dinner
and go straight to dessert.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.793
Bread pudding it is, then.
All right.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.628
-(Beth chuckles)
-I'm so excited

09:54.662 --> 09:56.697
to be exploring D.C. with you.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.705
What's wrong?

10:05.673 --> 10:08.709
That's my old ballet teacher.

10:11.178 --> 10:14.614
I haven't seen him
since I quit dance.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.523
-("The Untold"
by Secession Studios playing)
-(dancing footsteps)

10:38.906 --> 10:41.408
-(music stops)
-May I?

10:42.409 --> 10:45.278
Sorry. I hope that it's okay
that I'm here. I just wanted

10:45.312 --> 10:47.815
to get a little practice in
before the showcase tonight.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.282
No need to apologize.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.351
Pirouettes used to be tricky
for me, too.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.053
My old dance teacher taught me

10:53.086 --> 10:56.990
to imagine a string, right,
from the crown

10:57.024 --> 10:59.626
of my head
pulling me all the way up

10:59.659 --> 11:01.494
to the ceiling.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.997
Yeah.
(chuckles)

11:04.031 --> 11:06.366
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.537
Why'd you pick me?

11:12.706 --> 11:16.476
I feel like I'm playing catch-up
to everybody else here.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.245
I was the best
at my old dance studio.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.346
But here?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.381
I'm not the skinniest

11:21.414 --> 11:24.284
or the most flexible.
I don't even have the best feet.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.723
My dad wants me to be
a lawyer like him.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.494
You know,
my mom was a lot like your dad.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.998
She wanted me to be an educator
just like her.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.834
This whole dance world
never made sense to her.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.570
But I fought to be a part of it.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.806
Just like you did.

11:47.607 --> 11:51.011
Stacey, I chose you
because I saw a fire in you

11:51.044 --> 11:52.913
that I recognized in myself.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.652
Try again.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.823
Try again.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.934
Our new neighbors
are just like you.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.036
KATE:
Hey.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.370
Where's Sophie?

12:17.404 --> 12:18.806
She's on the phone
with her mom.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.640
PEGGY: Well, do you think
my feet are too big?

12:20.673 --> 12:23.543
HANK: No. There's just
more of you to love.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.478
(TV mutes)

12:26.513 --> 12:29.216
Are you gonna say something
about my weight?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.084
Do you want me to?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.054
No.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.523
You gonna say something
about my drinking?

12:38.025 --> 12:40.093
Do you want me to?

12:43.030 --> 12:44.497
No.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.502
L.A.'s been tough.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.806
I joined an acting class,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.641
you know,
hoping it would help me.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.810
That's great, Kev.

12:56.844 --> 13:00.180
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah,
but now you want to tell me

13:00.213 --> 13:01.514
what's really going on?

13:05.385 --> 13:07.020
Kevin.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.459
(breathes deeply)

13:12.492 --> 13:14.527
I met this girl.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.832
And she was really cool,
so we started hanging out.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.767
You know, I've been lonely

13:20.800 --> 13:24.171
because, between Sophie's
classes and my auditions,

13:24.204 --> 13:25.638
you know,
we don't get much time to talk.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.741
Kevin, what did you do?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.880
It was just one time.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.815
I swear.

13:35.849 --> 13:39.152
(sighs)
Oh, my God.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.788
Oh, God, Kevin. K-K...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.991
How could you do this to Sophie?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.026
How could you do that?
She loves you so much.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.095
Don't you think I know that?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.298
I can't even look at her, Kate.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.732
Every time
I'm in the same room as her,

13:52.765 --> 13:54.034
I feel like I'm gonna throw up
from the guilt.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.103
Good.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.509
-You need to tell her.
-No.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.011
It will kill her, Kate.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.678
What if she doesn't forgive me?

14:05.712 --> 14:07.347
Okay, well, what...?
So, what do you expect?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.016
What...
What am I supposed to do?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.517
I'm supposed to keep this
from her now?

14:10.550 --> 14:12.185
She's one of my best friends.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.221
And I'm your brother.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.824
This is incredible.
Everything looks so real.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.492
Yeah. The first time
Kev brought me backstage--

14:19.526 --> 14:22.829
you wouldn't believe it--
the host of Survivor was there.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.265
-Jeff Probst?
-Jeff mother-lovin' Probst.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.167
-(chuckles) What did you do?
-Uh, I freaked out.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.069
I spilled my cold brew
from crafty all over him.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.570
Crafty is craft services.
It's where they keep

14:30.603 --> 14:32.005
-all the snacks. Yeah.
-Oh...

14:32.039 --> 14:33.340
Yeah, stick with me, kid.
I'll show you the ropes.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.774
-Hey! What's up?
-KATE: Hi.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.843
Thanks for coming. Thanks
for coming. Thanks for coming.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.679
Hi. So good to get to spend
some time with you.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.414
We haven't seen you
since, what, breakfast?

14:41.448 --> 14:42.715
(Toby chuckles)

14:42.749 --> 14:44.451
-Toby.
-What? It's a joke.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.853
'Cause we-we live together.
Never mind. I'll get

14:46.886 --> 14:48.555
-one of the writers
to punch it up.
-KEVIN: Mm.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.123
A punch-up is
when the writers take a bad joke

14:50.157 --> 14:51.791
-and they make it funny.
-Oh, I know.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.027
I learned that
from the Friends reunion.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.029
ELIJAH:
Hey, I saw a gumball machine

14:56.063 --> 14:59.466
on the way in.
Now, are the gumballs real?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.634
They are. They're real, yeah.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.370
Not only that, but you don't
have to put a quarter in,

15:03.403 --> 15:05.038
-so you can just have at it.
-Really?

15:05.072 --> 15:07.907
-KEVIN: Yeah.
-Thanks. Okay.
Okay, you know what?

15:07.941 --> 15:09.977
-I'll bring some back
for the group.
-(phone vibrating)

15:10.010 --> 15:11.211
-Thank you.
-KATE: Oh, thanks.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.213
And I have to take this.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.148
-Sorry about the... joke.
-(Kate clears throat)

15:15.182 --> 15:17.084
-It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
-Thank you.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.918
Yello.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.555
Oh, hey, Madison.
Listen, I sent you

15:22.589 --> 15:24.391
some flight options
for Thanksgiving. I don't know

15:24.424 --> 15:25.658
if you saw or not,
but I'm thinking we

15:25.692 --> 15:27.260
should book early
because, you know, the seats

15:27.294 --> 15:30.163
tend to fill up... What-what...
What's this? You keep looking

15:30.197 --> 15:32.332
at each other.
What am I missing?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.167
Is this an Elijah thing?
Because obviously,

15:34.201 --> 15:35.602
I mean,
he's more than welcome to come.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.804
Kevin, can we talk
about this later?

15:37.837 --> 15:39.472
I don't want to do this here

15:39.506 --> 15:40.673
on such an important day
for you.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.142
No, you just want to sit here
and continue

15:42.175 --> 15:45.645
to share ominous looks
with each other.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.281
Okay, fine.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.949
Um...

15:49.983 --> 15:51.851
I don't want to go to the cabin.

15:51.884 --> 15:55.522
I want to spend Thanksgiving
with Elijah

15:55.555 --> 15:59.492
here in L.A. With the twins.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.830
P.A.:
Hey, Kevin? We need you on set.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.832
Oh.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.434
Perfect.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.868
Um...

16:10.970 --> 16:14.407
Well, hey, you know,
um, to be continued.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.385
We don't have to stay.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.654
We can get
the bread pudding to go.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.624
I saw that man every day

16:31.658 --> 16:33.693
from when I was 12 to 17.

16:33.726 --> 16:36.129
I was his favorite,

16:36.163 --> 16:39.699
until I started struggling,
and then he just dropped me.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.073
When my dad died, he didn't even
pick up the damn phone.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.907
Want me to go over there

16:47.940 --> 16:49.576
and show him where
his ballet shoes can go?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.711
No.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.916
But I will.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.723
Hey. I'm right here.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.402
Bethany.

17:15.435 --> 17:19.172
It's so nice to see you.
How long has it been?

17:19.206 --> 17:21.341
Uh, 23 months.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.111
Wow. That long, huh?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.213
Well, you look well.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.517
So, w-what have you been up to?
Fill me in.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.685
Um...

17:32.719 --> 17:34.587
I'm an architecture major
at CMU.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.626
That's wonderful. I always knew
you had a bright mind.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.797
Why don't you stop by the studio
one of these days.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.166
The girls would love to see you.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.737
-Sure.
-Yeah.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.472
Great.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.311
Take care.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.150
Um...

18:03.183 --> 18:06.219
Let's just forget about
the bread pudding and go.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.787
Let's go.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.322
Yeah.

18:09.356 --> 18:12.125
All right, let's go.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.966
Hey, phones off, now.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.169
-Hey, guys. You made it.
-Hey.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.636
How you feeling?

18:23.670 --> 18:26.005
Excited and terrified.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.774
-(chuckles)
-Which for some reason

18:27.807 --> 18:29.742
is making me
have to pee a lot, you know.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.344
It's like I'm about to get
onstage and perform.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.246
But this should be
the easy part for you.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.614
You already done
all the hard work.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.848
Now, you just
sit back and watch.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.917
That's what I thought,
but when you perform,

18:37.950 --> 18:39.319
it's like you have some control.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.820
Now, I'm just the lady
waiting in the wings,

18:40.853 --> 18:43.356
hoping everything goes well.

18:43.390 --> 18:47.160
I can't fail at this again,
Randall. I just... I can't.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.928
You won't.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.299
I'm sorry. "You won't"
is not good enough.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.700
Okay? I don't mean

18:53.733 --> 18:54.934
to put too much pressure
on you, baby,

18:54.967 --> 18:56.469
but I'm freaking out right now,

18:56.503 --> 18:58.471
and I'm gonna need one of your
all-time greatest pep talks,

18:58.505 --> 19:00.507
and I'm gonna need it now.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.309
Beth Pearson, you're
an incredible human being...

19:02.342 --> 19:04.811
Damn it. I got to pee again,
baby. I'm so sorry.

19:04.844 --> 19:05.878
Okay.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.318
Not to brag, but...

19:11.351 --> 19:13.320
I think we may have Emeril beat.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.987
Emeril should be
watching us on TV.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.790
(both laugh)

19:17.824 --> 19:19.992
Well, at least we don't
have to worry about dessert,

19:20.026 --> 19:22.329
since Matt is bringing
his "famous" pumpkin pie

19:22.362 --> 19:24.331
to the Thanksgiving
he invited himself to.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.733
What? I invited him.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.135
Yeah, well, he didn't really
give you much of a choice,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.238
did he? I mean,
what else were you gonna do?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.872
This needs some brown sugar.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.481
-(babies crying)
-What's going on down there?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.015
You know, they've been
crying for hours.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.251
They're gonna grow up to sound

19:44.284 --> 19:46.152
like Gilbert Gottfried,
aren't they?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.420
-(audience laughs)
-KEVIN (imitating Gottfried):
Aren't they?

19:47.454 --> 19:48.388
Are you okay?

19:48.421 --> 19:49.756
TYLER:
Let me help.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.558
I knew this wouldn't
go over well.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.760
It's a lot to spring on him.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.596
Maybe it's just easier if
I bring the twins to the cabin.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.198
KEVIN:
...for the next Marvel superhero
movie. I think I've got this.

19:59.232 --> 20:01.601
-(audience laughs)
-(applause)

20:01.634 --> 20:04.604
You know, I just, I want to be
a good dad to my kids, is all.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.672
I-I want to be the best dad

20:05.705 --> 20:07.173
to my kids 'cause...

20:07.206 --> 20:08.207
that's what my kids deserve.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.110
AUDIENCE:
Aw!

20:11.143 --> 20:13.346
* There's a black hat caught *

20:13.380 --> 20:15.348
* In a high treetop... *

20:15.382 --> 20:16.783
SOPHIE:
Kate.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.518
(turns music down)

20:18.551 --> 20:20.119
Earth to Kate!

20:20.152 --> 20:22.121
Oh. What? Did you say something?

20:22.154 --> 20:25.525
Yes. I said that I brought
my Thelma & Louise DVD.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.793
Rewatch session tonight?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.628
Sure. I mean,

20:28.661 --> 20:30.563
you know I can't resist
Brad Pitt in those jeans.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.799
(chuckles)

20:32.832 --> 20:34.334
Kevin's being weird.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.170
What do you think is going on?

20:40.006 --> 20:41.574
Have you noticed the drinking?

20:41.608 --> 20:44.477
Yeah. Yeah.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.413
I, um...

20:46.446 --> 20:48.615
You know, I-I think he's-he's...

20:48.648 --> 20:50.483
stressed about career stuff.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.620
It's taking a lot longer
than he'd hoped it would

20:53.653 --> 20:55.822
to get started
with the acting stuff.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.160
Yeah, you're-you're
probably right. (chuckles)

21:02.829 --> 21:04.163
Thanks, Thelma.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.666
(chuckles) You got it, Louise.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.802
* That's my soul up there *

21:09.836 --> 21:11.904
* There's a blue whale beached *

21:11.938 --> 21:15.308
* By a springtime's ebb. *

21:19.946 --> 21:22.949
All right. We saw,
we brined, we conquered.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.918
-We about to kick
Thanksgiving's ass.
-(chuckles) Hear, hear.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.320
Salud.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.989
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.325
Oh, Mrs. Pearson,
Matt is so sweet.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.161
-I'm happy for you.
-Thanks.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.664
-Do you see it
going the distance?
-Oh.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.700
I don't know.
We're having fun. (chuckles)

21:40.733 --> 21:42.502
Wow. What a rave.

21:42.535 --> 21:45.872
He's a nice guy, and

21:45.905 --> 21:48.174
we're having a good time.
I mean, it's...

21:48.207 --> 21:50.510
it's not the great romance
that you two have,

21:50.543 --> 21:53.546
but that's
once-in-a-lifetime stuff.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.016
This jet lag's killing me.
I'm gonna go lay down.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.485
Okay.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.898
Are you mad at me
about something?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.065
No. Of course not.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.368
Then-then what is it?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.575
Soph, I made a horrible mistake

22:22.609 --> 22:24.243
that I'll regret
for the rest of my life.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.515
What?

22:28.548 --> 22:31.618
It happened one time,
and it didn't mean anything.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.157
The girl from your acting class?

22:38.190 --> 22:39.959
Yes.

22:44.431 --> 22:48.234
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.369
You are all that
matters to me, okay?

22:50.403 --> 22:52.605
The last thing
I'd want to do is hurt you.

22:52.639 --> 22:55.908
Okay, I... I knew that something
was wrong. I even asked Kate.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.077
Don't be mad at Kate. I begged
her not to say anything.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.850
I-I'm sorry,

23:03.883 --> 23:05.685
Kate knew?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.086
I had to tell somebody. Sophie,

23:07.119 --> 23:08.354
it was, it was
eating me up inside.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.890
That must've been
really hard for you.

23:10.923 --> 23:11.891
No.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.594
No, that's not what I... Soph...

23:19.832 --> 23:21.901
KATE:
Here he comes.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.470
Kevin, that was amazing.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.971
-Thanks.
-You improv'ed

23:25.004 --> 23:26.706
that Mount Everest joke,
didn't you?

23:26.739 --> 23:28.140
-'Cause I told Elijah
I could tell...
-(clears throat)

23:28.174 --> 23:29.909
You are aware that Thanksgiving
is my family's holy day,

23:29.942 --> 23:32.378
-right?
-We're doing this here.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.114
Guys, the prop guy said that
this thing costs $20,000.

23:35.147 --> 23:37.316
Yeah, that's right. It does,
and it's not a toy, so...

23:37.349 --> 23:39.151
Oh. Sorry.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.488
This is what you want? This
is how you want to do things?

23:41.521 --> 23:43.055
Just, you know,
split up the holidays

23:43.089 --> 23:44.624
like-like, what, we're some,

23:44.657 --> 23:46.325
we're some angry divorced couple

23:46.358 --> 23:47.894
that can't stand to be
in the same room as one another?

23:47.927 --> 23:50.663
-This is what you want
for our kids?
-Of course not.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.331
-That's not fair...
-Kevin, it--
Kevin, it's my fault.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.333
All right? I'm the one
that invited Maddy

23:54.366 --> 23:56.335
-for Thanksgiving...
-You know what, Elijah?
The only man allowed to speak

23:56.368 --> 23:58.104
is the one holding
the jelly baby, and that is me.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.840
Don't be rude to him, okay?

24:00.873 --> 24:02.609
I am not trying
to keep the kids away

24:02.642 --> 24:04.811
-from you.
-Well, you could've fooled me.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.614
A-And by the way,
I just-- you know,

24:07.647 --> 24:09.516
I got to say,
I think... (chuckles)

24:09.549 --> 24:11.150
I think it's really selfish

24:11.183 --> 24:12.519
that you could be
robbing my mother

24:12.552 --> 24:14.587
of what could possibly
be her last

24:14.621 --> 24:16.022
good Thanksgiving
with the twins.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.291
Kevin,

24:19.325 --> 24:20.927
I am well aware

24:20.960 --> 24:22.929
of how big of a deal
this is for you, okay?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.130
Kate thought it would be best

24:24.163 --> 24:25.464
if I told you
after the first taping...

24:25.498 --> 24:27.500
Yeah, no, a-and thank you
for that, Kate.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.968
-I appreciate it.
-Kevin...

24:29.001 --> 24:31.270
You know what? Here, Elijah,
just, you know, just--

24:31.303 --> 24:33.039
It's... it's all yours.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.610
MADISON:
I'm sorry about that.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.311
No.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.880
Don't be.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.119
Soph?

24:47.153 --> 24:49.221
Hey. Hey. Soph.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.990
Soph, where are you going?

24:51.023 --> 24:53.560
Kevin told me everything.
Thanks for having my back.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.195
Sophie, I-- Sophie, I'm sorry.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.498
I'm... What was I supposed
to do? He's my brother.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.501
Got it.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.170
Tell your mom I said bye, okay?

25:04.203 --> 25:06.072
No, hey, Sophie, listen,
you don't have to go like this.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.275
Bye, Kate.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.345
(door closes)

25:13.379 --> 25:15.047
(sighs)

25:43.042 --> 25:45.077
*

26:01.560 --> 26:03.696
Are you okay?

26:03.730 --> 26:05.965
No. I'm not okay.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.800
I'm eating gluten-free cookies
that taste like cardboard.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.535
I'm pretty far from okay.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.137
What was that back there,
by the way?

26:11.170 --> 26:13.105
You didn't have my back at all.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.306
Oh, that's rich.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.076
Kev, I've had your back
our entire lives,

26:17.109 --> 26:19.712
and it hasn't exactly
been a cakewalk.

26:19.746 --> 26:22.248
Okay? You take one step forward
and 16 steps back.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.050
-That's not fair.
-Okay,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.885
so you're finally supportive
of Madison and Elijah,

26:25.918 --> 26:27.219
but when it comes
to your holiday plans,

26:27.253 --> 26:28.821
16 steps back.

26:28.855 --> 26:30.056
No. Look, that's...

26:30.089 --> 26:32.625
Kev, you needed
my support, right?

26:32.659 --> 26:34.460
So, I let you crash
at our place,

26:34.493 --> 26:35.962
even though it's not great
for our marriage right now.

26:35.995 --> 26:38.765
Madison needs my support, too.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.166
But I also would like...

26:40.199 --> 26:43.002
No, Kev.
You didn't fall in love.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.837
Right? You couldn't say it.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.239
So, you expect her
to lug babies on an airplane

26:47.273 --> 26:48.975
to go see your family?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.242
Come on,
have a little more respect

26:50.276 --> 26:52.244
for the woman
who's raising your kids.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.147
She just wants
a quiet Thanksgiving

26:55.181 --> 26:56.649
with the kids
where she can create

26:56.683 --> 26:57.850
her own holiday traditions.

26:57.884 --> 27:00.586
-Yeah, with Elijah.
-Yeah, with Elijah.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.322
Who is a good man who is
falling in love with her--

27:03.355 --> 27:05.624
something she's never
experienced before--

27:05.658 --> 27:07.093
and she should be able
to enjoy that

27:07.126 --> 27:08.627
without being made
to feel guilty.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.401
Yeah.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.671
(sighs) Yeah.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.944
I'm s-- I know that you always
have my back. I know that.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.646
Yeah, I do.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.549
And if-if you and Toby need
your space, just... tell me.

27:30.582 --> 27:31.984
Yeah, Kev,

27:32.018 --> 27:34.486
that's-that's not even
our problem right now.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.856
We have a lot more
going on than that.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.392
*

28:05.551 --> 28:07.586
*

28:12.458 --> 28:13.926
(applause)

28:15.194 --> 28:17.063
-(gasps)
-(audience gasps)

28:18.931 --> 28:20.900
-Oh, God.
-(music stops)

28:20.933 --> 28:23.235
(audience murmuring)

28:26.038 --> 28:28.707
(panting)

28:38.550 --> 28:41.320
(footsteps crossing stage)

28:44.390 --> 28:46.692
Are you hurt?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.227
STACEY (whispers):
I don't think so.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.796
Okay. Let's get you up.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.532
(crying):
I can't.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.467
I'm sorry.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.303
I let you down. I let...

28:57.336 --> 28:59.972
I let them all down.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.911
You know, when I was dancing,
I fell.

29:07.113 --> 29:09.648
It was a different kind of fall,
bigger than this.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.786
I felt so alone.

29:17.623 --> 29:20.326
Stacey, I want you to know

29:20.359 --> 29:22.795
that I will sit with you
on this stage

29:22.829 --> 29:25.431
until everyone
in this audience gets bored

29:25.464 --> 29:28.434
and tired and leaves one by one.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.536
Or...

29:31.871 --> 29:34.306
...you can get up,

29:34.340 --> 29:37.076
you can start again,

29:37.109 --> 29:39.111
and I'll be waiting
for you right offstage

29:39.145 --> 29:40.346
after you take your bow.

29:41.680 --> 29:43.282
Either way, know two things,

29:43.315 --> 29:47.186
you cannot disappoint me.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.690
And I ain't going nowhere.

29:54.726 --> 29:55.962
(audience murmuring)

29:55.995 --> 29:58.831
You're gonna forget a lot
about these years,

29:58.865 --> 30:00.032
but look at your mother,

30:00.066 --> 30:02.869
right now, and remember this.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.171
Don't you ever forget

30:05.204 --> 30:07.373
how incredible that woman is.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.645
Take it from the top, okay?

30:14.580 --> 30:16.815
All right. Let's go.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.588
(applause)

30:27.359 --> 30:29.361
*

30:46.712 --> 30:50.049
(sighs) Kevin, it is late,
and I am too tired to argue.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.184
No, I know. It's-it's not that.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.886
I-I just came by to say...

30:55.754 --> 30:57.990
...that I think you should
celebrate Thanksgiving

30:58.024 --> 30:59.725
however you want
to celebrate Thanksgiving.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.395
I mean that.
The last thing you need

31:03.429 --> 31:05.264
is a cross-country trip
to, what,

31:05.297 --> 31:07.566
witness 50 Pearsons watch
Police Academy 3

31:07.599 --> 31:10.836
for the 300th time
and argue over an old hat?

31:10.869 --> 31:12.538
Thank you.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.841
You were good out there today.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.078
You stole the show
from a guy half your age.

31:19.111 --> 31:21.380
-That is a feat.
-Yeah. Well, thank you.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.682
-He's three-quarters
my age, but...
-Hmm...

31:23.715 --> 31:25.217
-Yeah... Okay.
-I don't know...

31:25.251 --> 31:26.518
-Well, thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.955
-Have a good night. All right.
-Good night.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.095
Hey, Kevin.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.796
Hey.

31:37.829 --> 31:41.267
Oh, listen, um,
Madison and I talked, and, um,

31:41.300 --> 31:42.868
Thanksgiving's
all yours, man, so...

31:42.901 --> 31:44.370
Everything's good.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.637
That was real decent of you.
Thank you.

31:45.671 --> 31:49.308
You're welcome.
No problem, no problem.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.576
Is that it? We good?

31:53.179 --> 31:55.914
Listen, um...

31:55.948 --> 31:59.651
I'm painfully aware that people
see me as the nice guy.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.253
Oh, come on,
this isn't necessary.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.788
Yeah, I-I'm not done.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.825
I'm also well aware that Maddy

32:06.858 --> 32:10.096
is eons out of my league,
but she likes me.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.332
She actually likes me.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.667
And...

32:15.701 --> 32:18.337
I like her.
Oh, man, more than you know.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.139
No, no, I'm-I'm getting
the gist.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.474
Yeah, right.
I-I guess what I'm saying is...

32:24.443 --> 32:26.678
...I hope you're not
biding your time

32:26.712 --> 32:29.948
and playing nice because
you think I'm going away.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.384
Because if you are...

32:34.220 --> 32:36.455
...you're gonna be
waiting a long time.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.828
Point taken.

32:42.861 --> 32:46.698
Okay. Okay.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.134
(chuckles) Thanks.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.302
-Later, man.
-Yup.

32:58.377 --> 33:01.547
Thanks again for all your help.
You are one hell of a sous-chef,

33:01.580 --> 33:03.849
-Miguel.
-Oh, that would be
one hell of a compliment,

33:03.882 --> 33:07.386
-except I'm pretty sure
that you're my sous-chef?
-Mm.

33:07.419 --> 33:08.687
-No. You are.
-Really?

33:08.720 --> 33:11.990
-Yeah. (chuckles)
-I think that... Mm.

33:12.024 --> 33:13.159
Okay.

33:13.192 --> 33:17.296
Um, I'm sorry about earlier.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.132
The little digs at Matt.
Way out of line.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.668
He seems like a really nice guy.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.403
-He really does.
-Your opinion

33:24.436 --> 33:26.305
matters a lot to me, you know?

33:26.338 --> 33:29.575
-(chuckles)
-And I hate to break it to you,

33:29.608 --> 33:33.712
but you're-you're basically
my best friend, Miguel.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.150
Back at you.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.152
(chuckles softly)

33:40.186 --> 33:42.421
Oh, um, I was thinking,

33:42.454 --> 33:45.491
I'd like to invite Marguerite
to Thanksgiving, too.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.259
-If that's okay?
-Oh.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.927
I thought Marguerite
was old news.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.996
Yeah, well,
Marguerite made a comeback.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.132
Turns out she has
a hell of a golf swing.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.836
Well, good for Marguerite.
(chuckles)

33:57.869 --> 33:59.871
Yeah. I look forward
to meeting her.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.940
-Great. Okay.
-Okay.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.780
(door closes)

34:11.049 --> 34:13.051
(strumming chords rhythmically)

34:15.554 --> 34:17.189
Hmm.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.525
Kev, Kev, Kev. Shh, shh, shh.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.527
Could we just keep
the jam sessions

34:21.560 --> 34:23.195
to the daylight hours, please?
I'm still working

34:23.229 --> 34:25.197
-out here.
-No problem. Sorry.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.966
Sorry. Oh, hey. Real quick tip.
Just brother to brother,

34:27.999 --> 34:29.235
that whole Bluetooth thing?

34:29.268 --> 34:31.737
It's driving Kate crazy.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.641
-Thanks for the heads-up.
-No problem.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.309
You know, in fact, uh,
just a little tip for you.

34:37.343 --> 34:39.245
The reason I'm out here
pacing around on my Bluetooth

34:39.278 --> 34:42.047
is because I usually take
these phone calls in this room.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.216
The room that you're
currently using as an Airbnb.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.985
-So that's...
-Okay. I was just trying
to help you out, man.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.887
-Uh-huh.
-All right?
But if you want me to leave,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.923
uh, you just say the word.
I can...

34:52.924 --> 34:54.426
You have a good night, Kevin.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.095
-Okay.
You have a good night. Okay.
-Okay. All right.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.499
(strums softly)

35:00.532 --> 35:02.468
(strums loudly)

35:02.501 --> 35:04.536
*

35:32.063 --> 35:34.132
*

35:39.004 --> 35:40.872
(message sends)

35:47.045 --> 35:49.014
(phone chimes)

36:06.432 --> 36:08.367
(footsteps approaching)

36:18.210 --> 36:19.745
Girls are upstairs

36:19.778 --> 36:22.848
giving you rave reviews
between flossing.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.851
-Our girls?
-Mm-hmm.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.653
You coming up?

36:27.686 --> 36:29.721
Yeah. I'm right behind you.

36:54.813 --> 36:57.883
(doors closing upstairs)

37:13.765 --> 37:15.734
(phone beeps)

37:15.767 --> 37:19.137
(line rings)

37:19.170 --> 37:22.574
VINCENT:
Whitmore Ballet Academy.
Vincent speaking.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.076
Hi, Vincent.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.978
It's Beth.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.380
Bethany Clarke.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.882
Um, well, Pearson now,
but, um...

37:30.916 --> 37:32.718
I used to be a student of yours.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.887
Well, Bethany.
How wonderful to hear from you.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.056
Still burning the candle
at both ends, huh?

37:38.089 --> 37:40.759
Well, I wish I could say
I pulled back over the years,

37:40.792 --> 37:42.394
but, uh, here I am.

37:42.428 --> 37:45.297
(chuckles)
My wife is not pleased.

37:45.331 --> 37:48.567
Um, how have you been?

37:48.600 --> 37:52.237
I'm well.
I'm really well. In fact,

37:52.270 --> 37:55.106
I'm the head of new student
recruitment and development

37:55.140 --> 37:57.309
for the City Ballet
of Philadelphia.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.411
Wow. Would you look at that?

37:59.445 --> 38:02.948
I always knew
you'd go far, Bethany.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.016
I always saw that in you.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.956
Was there, um, something else?

38:11.957 --> 38:13.925
Yeah.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.994
Um...

38:20.966 --> 38:24.870
I was with you every single day,
Vincent.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.606
During my formative years,

38:27.639 --> 38:31.977
you were my sun
and my moon and...

38:32.010 --> 38:35.213
Hell, you were like a god to me,
if I'm being honest.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.848
And...

38:38.417 --> 38:40.652
It meant so much
that you chose me

38:40.686 --> 38:42.988
out of all the other girls
to be your favorite.

38:43.021 --> 38:47.025
That confidence you had in me
meant everything.

38:48.026 --> 38:51.029
I was ready to be your star.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.567
But, uh...

38:55.601 --> 38:57.168
when my dad died

38:57.202 --> 39:00.071
and I couldn't perform
up to your standards,

39:00.105 --> 39:01.740
you just...

39:03.108 --> 39:04.209
...tossed me aside.

39:04.242 --> 39:05.911
You literally...

39:05.944 --> 39:08.814
You literally replaced me
with someone else

39:08.847 --> 39:13.018
without a word of comfort
or explanation.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.986
You just...

39:15.020 --> 39:17.689
didn't look back.
(chuckles)

39:19.691 --> 39:23.194
Well, I'm-I'm, uh, I'm sorry
you felt that way, Bethany,

39:23.228 --> 39:26.998
but it wasn't my job
to, uh, coddle you.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.268
It was my job to give you
the technique you needed

39:30.301 --> 39:32.504
-to be a star.
-Yeah. You're right.

39:32.538 --> 39:36.207
And, um, and I probably reached
my peak, but...

39:37.743 --> 39:39.778
When I think about it, that...

39:41.212 --> 39:43.915
...failure, it...

39:43.949 --> 39:47.686
it turns my stomach
like I'm on a roller coaster.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.888
I...

39:49.921 --> 39:53.559
It's the part of me
that made me feel so small.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.528
And it's the part of me that...

39:56.562 --> 40:00.632
I tried to hide from my husband
and from my girls and...

40:00.666 --> 40:03.234
It's the part of me I hated.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.638
Well, Bethany, I, uh,

40:06.672 --> 40:09.407
I-I don't know what to say.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.880
I thought I would dance
on the world's biggest stages.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.949
But I've learned
that there is power...

40:19.918 --> 40:22.654
...in waiting in the wings.

40:22.688 --> 40:26.458
In being there
for the dancers that are stars

40:26.492 --> 40:27.693
and the ones that aren't.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.296
I...

40:31.329 --> 40:35.601
for so long
had put a part of myself away.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.605
But not anymore.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.977
I'm the little island girl
who danced before she walked.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.179
And you took that from me.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.719
But now I'm taking it back.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.723
I know who I am.

40:59.658 --> 41:02.127
And I know
what I was meant to do now.

41:10.802 --> 41:12.303
Mrs. Pearson?

41:12.337 --> 41:14.339
The new recruits are in the main
studio and would love to hear

41:14.372 --> 41:16.374
-from you.
-Okay, thanks.
I'll be right there.

41:16.407 --> 41:18.209
And this came for you.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.611
It's from Stacey Robins.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.680
*

41:46.538 --> 41:48.540
*

42:01.687 --> 42:04.189
ABE:
Don't ever forget

42:04.222 --> 42:05.991
how special you are.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.193
Our little island girl

42:08.226 --> 42:11.362
-who danced before she walked.
-Who danced before she walked.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.933
You're going to change the world
one day.
