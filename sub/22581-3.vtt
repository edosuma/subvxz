WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:07.257
I didn't realize you spoke slug.

00:07.466 --> 00:09.593
I wish I did.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.137
She doesn't look any better,
does she?

00:12.346 --> 00:17.184
She? We haven't been able to
determine its gender, if it has one.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.771
- I should've left her where I found her.
- Nonsense.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.481
You're on a mission of exploration.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.816
There's something to be learned
from every life form.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.903
She wasn't meant to be
in this environment.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.156
I promise to do my best
to keep it alive.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.495
He's gonna make you all better.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.081
Actually, I was thinking more
about my Pyrithian bat.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.334
He won't eat anything once it's dead.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.297
We've routed some more
power to Sickbay.

00:47.505 --> 00:50.508
- Let me know if it's enough.
- This should do fine.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.969
How's Sluggo?

00:53.178 --> 00:56.181
Dr Phlox thinks this argon lamp
should help...

00:57.057 --> 00:59.726
...but she has barely moved all day.

00:59.934 --> 01:04.480
We've been out here for two weeks,
and the only first contact we've made...

01:04.980 --> 01:07.984
...is with a dying worm.

01:14.199 --> 01:19.537
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:21.998 --> 01:25.418
"It's been a long time"

01:25.627 --> 01:29.464
"But my time is finally near"

01:29.672 --> 01:33.926
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:34.135 --> 01:37.055
"I will touch the sky"

01:37.263 --> 01:41.058
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:41.267 --> 01:44.270
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:44.479 --> 01:49.192
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:49.400 --> 01:52.320
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:52.528 --> 01:57.116
"I've got faith to believe"

01:57.325 --> 01:59.911
"I can do anything"

02:00.119 --> 02:04.624
I've got strength of the soul

02:04.832 --> 02:07.710
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:07.918 --> 02:13.257
"I can reach any star"

02:13.632 --> 02:17.386
"I've got faith"

02:17.595 --> 02:21.307
"I've got faith"

02:21.515 --> 02:26.312
"Faith of the heart"

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074

02:42.745 --> 02:44.288
Come in.

02:46.206 --> 02:48.584
The scans of the sectors ahead...

02:49.376 --> 02:50.878
Hear that?

02:51.795 --> 02:54.465
- Hear what?
- A squeak.

02:54.673 --> 02:56.717
Something's squeaking.

02:57.301 --> 02:59.428
I think it's coming from under
the deck plating,

02:59.636 --> 03:02.639
but every time I get close to it,
it stops.

03:03.265 --> 03:06.143
If I can't isolate it, I'm gonna
have to tear the whole flooring up.

03:06.393 --> 03:09.563
That would be unfortunate.

03:10.022 --> 03:12.316
The scans of the sectors ahead
indicate little chance

03:12.524 --> 03:15.193
of finding inhabited planets.

03:15.402 --> 03:17.112
Well, how about
the Vulcan star charts?

03:17.321 --> 03:20.324
We have limited data on the course
that Starfleet assigned you.

03:20.532 --> 03:23.785
There are thousands of star systems
along this path.

03:23.994 --> 03:26.997
There must've been something
that piqued your people's interest.

03:27.664 --> 03:30.959
A sentient species,
a trinary star cluster.

03:31.168 --> 03:34.671
We don't select our destinations
by what piques our interest.

03:35.755 --> 03:39.092
Vulcans always need a logical
and pragmatic reason.

03:39.301 --> 03:43.221
My people don't share your
enthusiasm for exploration.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.353
Space is vast, captain.

03:50.562 --> 03:54.399
I'm sure you're aware that only
one out of every 43,000 planets

03:54.608 --> 03:57.652
- supports intelligent life.
- I took exobiology.

03:57.861 --> 04:00.113
I know the statistics.

04:01.364 --> 04:04.909
But we're travelling at warp 5.
There's gotta be someone out here.

04:05.744 --> 04:07.412
Come in.

04:10.081 --> 04:12.125
I'm sorry...

04:13.710 --> 04:16.254
I'll leave you to your exploring.

04:19.257 --> 04:22.093
Trip tells me that Sluggo's
not faring too well.

04:22.302 --> 04:25.305
No, sir. But the doctor's
doing the best he can.

04:26.472 --> 04:30.560
Sir, my quarters are on E Deck,
starboard section five.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.188
- Yes?
- The stars are going the wrong way.

04:36.107 --> 04:37.734
Wrong way?

04:38.276 --> 04:41.988
On both my training tours,
I had portside quarters.

04:42.196 --> 04:43.781
I'm having trouble sleeping.

04:44.782 --> 04:48.161
- Because you're on the wrong side...
- The wrong side of the ship. Yes, sir.

04:48.369 --> 04:52.123
Ensign Porter said he'd be willing
to switch with your permission.

04:52.707 --> 04:54.125
You got it.

04:54.375 --> 04:56.377
Can't have my com officer...

04:57.253 --> 04:59.046
...falling asleep on the bridge.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.424
Appreciate it, captain.

05:04.302 --> 05:08.264
- Is there something else, Hoshi?
- No, sir. Thank you.

05:17.606 --> 05:18.941
Ready?

05:19.150 --> 05:21.527
Fore and aft target scanners
are aligned.

05:21.736 --> 05:25.614
Activating simulation J-6.

05:31.662 --> 05:33.998
- Target acquired.
- Simulated launch.

05:37.501 --> 05:39.169
Five seconds to impact.

05:40.129 --> 05:44.341
Three, two, one.

05:46.885 --> 05:48.595
Wonderful.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.516
- We're only off by three metres.
- Only three metres.

05:52.808 --> 05:56.520
That could be the difference between
hitting a weapons port and a warp core.

05:56.729 --> 05:59.523
Instead of disabling a vessel,
we'd end up destroying it,

05:59.732 --> 06:01.525
and probably ourselves
in the process.

06:01.733 --> 06:03.610
We'll get it right.

06:03.819 --> 06:06.446
All this should have been dealt with
before we left Earth.

06:07.030 --> 06:09.324
Have they detected any inhabited
planets or vessels?

06:09.867 --> 06:12.578
- Not yet.
- Good.

06:13.245 --> 06:16.582
I hope you don't expect everyone
we run into out here to be hostile.

06:16.790 --> 06:19.209
In 23 years, I don't think my folks
ran into problems

06:19.418 --> 06:21.545
more than a half dozen times.

06:21.753 --> 06:24.381
I don't believe you were
ever out quite this far.

06:24.589 --> 06:26.717
You think that makes a difference?

06:27.467 --> 06:31.471
All I do know is that until we get these
targeting scanners working properly,

06:31.722 --> 06:34.349
the farther we are from
everyone else, the better.

06:34.558 --> 06:37.727
Seems like everybody else onboard
is itching for a first contact.

06:40.564 --> 06:43.525
- How's it going?
- Not well, sir.

06:43.733 --> 06:48.196
We've corrected the problem,
but we're still off by .02 percent.

06:48.405 --> 06:49.656
It's unacceptable.

06:49.865 --> 06:52.450
Are you sure it's not
the simulations that are off?

06:52.659 --> 06:55.203
There's only one way to find out.

06:56.371 --> 06:59.374
How long would it take
to arm a few torpedoes?

06:59.582 --> 07:01.543
Moments, sir.

07:05.922 --> 07:07.882
- Archer to T'Pol.
- Yes, sir.

07:08.091 --> 07:10.093
Prepare to drop out of warp.

07:10.301 --> 07:13.596
- It's time for a little target practice.
- Acknowledged.

07:14.180 --> 07:17.016
- Thank you, captain.
- Come on, Travis.

07:17.225 --> 07:20.019
We've gotta find Mr Reed
something to blow up.

07:34.534 --> 07:36.160
Load another one. Let's try again.

07:36.369 --> 07:38.454
Rotate the targeting axis
by .5 microns.

07:40.748 --> 07:43.292
Point-five microns.

08:05.439 --> 08:07.149
Mr Reed.

08:11.362 --> 08:15.324
If I refocus the infrared scanner,
I might be able to compensate.

08:15.533 --> 08:18.703
- How long will that take?
- The better part of a day.

08:20.121 --> 08:22.248
Resume course, ensign.

08:22.623 --> 08:23.999
Sir.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.752
We're not gonna sit on our butt
for 24 hours.

08:26.961 --> 08:30.881
Make your modifications, we'll run
another test first chance we get.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.345
- Anyone sitting here?
- No.

08:36.554 --> 08:38.889
Please, sit down. Sit down.

08:39.807 --> 08:42.768
- Sluggo any better?
- I'm afraid not.

08:42.977 --> 08:45.145
Try the potatoes. They're delicious.

08:50.859 --> 08:53.112
- Resequenced protein.
- Yes.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.614
The flavour's remarkable.

08:56.407 --> 08:59.284
On my homeworld, people would
never think of speaking during a meal.

08:59.493 --> 09:01.787
Considered a waste of time.

09:01.995 --> 09:04.665
It's taken me a while,
but I've grown quite attached to it.

09:04.873 --> 09:07.334
Wasting time seems to be
all we've been doing.

09:07.543 --> 09:10.879
- Starting to get a little antsy.
- Antsy?

09:11.922 --> 09:13.632
Restless.

09:13.841 --> 09:17.678
We've been on the move for two weeks
and haven't seen a damn thing.

09:17.886 --> 09:20.305
Every moment's been
an adventure for me.

09:20.514 --> 09:23.392
Humans are so unpredictable.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.895
Have you seen the quantities of food
Crewman Namod consumes?

09:27.521 --> 09:29.690
- Not really.
- Have you smelled Ensign Socorro

09:29.898 --> 09:31.733
after she exercises?

09:33.485 --> 09:37.280
She gives off a fragrance not unlike
the adrenal gland of a Nausicaan.

09:38.699 --> 09:42.452
And Crewmen Bennett and Haynem
over there. Do you see them?

09:42.661 --> 09:45.747
If I'm not mistaken,
they are preparing to mate.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.669
Do you think they
might let me watch?

09:51.628 --> 09:53.922
It's good to see you're
enjoying yourself.

10:04.766 --> 10:06.351
Bridge to Captain Archer.

10:07.435 --> 10:10.230
- How big is it?
- Approximately 92 metres in length.

10:10.438 --> 10:14.109
- Doesn't seem to be moving very fast.
- It's not moving at all.

10:14.401 --> 10:16.236
That's odd.

10:16.444 --> 10:19.989
- Where's the nearest star system?
- Almost three light-years away.

10:20.198 --> 10:23.243
They could be running some
kind of a deep-space experiment.

10:23.451 --> 10:24.953
Maybe we should go have a look.

10:25.161 --> 10:29.290
If you insist on allowing your
curiosity to dictate your actions.

10:29.916 --> 10:31.668
We insist.

10:36.923 --> 10:39.259
Range, 5,000 kilometres.

10:41.052 --> 10:45.264
The vessel's hull is comprised of
tritanium and disilicon polymers.

10:45.473 --> 10:48.601
I'm not getting anything
on their propulsion system,

10:48.851 --> 10:50.937
but it may be off-line.

10:51.646 --> 10:53.981
- Something, isn't it?
- If they have weapons,

10:54.190 --> 10:57.235
- they're not charged.
- Any com activity?

10:59.070 --> 11:00.738
No, sir.

11:02.949 --> 11:05.618
Run this through
the translation matrix.

11:07.495 --> 11:09.789
My name is Jonathan Archer.

11:09.997 --> 11:12.792
I'm captain of
the starship Enterprise.

11:13.751 --> 11:15.544
We're on a mission of...

11:16.045 --> 11:18.464
...peaceful exploration.

11:20.967 --> 11:23.678
We come from the planet Earth.

11:24.845 --> 11:29.934
We're sending you a pulsar grid that
should help you locate our star system.

11:35.397 --> 11:38.651
- Did you rotate the frequencies?
- I'll try it again.

11:41.111 --> 11:42.488
No response, sir.

11:45.366 --> 11:48.410
Captain, mind if I push in on
the venting ports around that hatch?

11:48.619 --> 11:50.120
Go ahead.

11:54.416 --> 11:57.544
Are those venting ports
or hull breaches?

11:57.753 --> 12:01.507
Bring us in a little closer, Travis.
Let's get a look at the other side.

12:10.432 --> 12:12.267
Those look like scorch marks.

12:12.476 --> 12:16.188
The residue indicates oxidation
and thermal shock effects.

12:16.396 --> 12:19.066
It could be the result of a
high-yield particle impact.

12:19.274 --> 12:22.319
- You mean weapons.
- Possibly.

12:23.779 --> 12:25.864
Are we close enough
to scan for bio-signs?

12:26.073 --> 12:30.577
Yes, but scanning their ship's interior
might be seen as a violation of privacy.

12:33.205 --> 12:34.847
Anything?

12:36.041 --> 12:39.628
If there is anyone home,
you can bet they know we're out here.

12:40.253 --> 12:41.755
Then why haven't they responded?

12:41.963 --> 12:45.509
Not everyone chooses to answer
the door when they hear a knock.

12:45.717 --> 12:48.720
It would be best to resume
our previous course.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.558
See if you can find another hatch.

12:59.856 --> 13:02.108
- Diameter?
- Point-nine metres.

13:04.736 --> 13:06.488
Scan for bio-signs.

13:12.702 --> 13:15.205
There are a number
of life forms aboard.

13:15.413 --> 13:17.582
- Humanoid?
- Their cellular activity is below

13:17.791 --> 13:19.542
the threshold of your sensors.

13:19.751 --> 13:22.587
Maybe they're in trouble.
Sick or something.

13:22.796 --> 13:24.964
Maybe they're not
interested in visitors.

13:28.343 --> 13:31.471
- Mr Reed, how long to prep a shuttle?
- Half an hour.

13:31.679 --> 13:34.599
There are a number of protocols
we haven't tried.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.393
Get started.

13:37.602 --> 13:39.729
She may have a point.
I could try hailing them

13:39.938 --> 13:42.523
- on the theta-band frequencies
- Suit up, ensign.

13:43.608 --> 13:44.943
Me, sir?

13:45.777 --> 13:47.987
The ship is yours.

13:56.662 --> 14:00.166
- Is there a problem, commander?
- I wanna go with you.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.002
I'm bringing a translator
and a security officer.

14:03.211 --> 14:04.462
Why would I need an engineer?

14:04.670 --> 14:06.589
What makes you think
you can open the hatch,

14:06.798 --> 14:09.550
- or turn the lights on for that matter?
- We've got beacons, Trip.

14:09.759 --> 14:11.135
It could have a lot of decks.

14:11.344 --> 14:14.138
You might need someone
to help you figure out the turbolifts.

14:14.597 --> 14:18.309
Okay, I've got a better reason
why you need an engineer.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.811
Your engineer signed onto
this mission of exploration

14:21.020 --> 14:22.688
so he could do a little exploring.

14:22.897 --> 14:25.066
He didn't sign on to sit in
Engineering while you three

14:25.274 --> 14:27.777
- get to break into that ship.
- We're not breaking in.

14:27.985 --> 14:29.820
We're just going to see
if everything's okay.

14:30.029 --> 14:32.031
You're chomping at the bit
to find what's in there.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.618
- Why should I be any different?
- We just got out here, Trip.

14:36.452 --> 14:38.788
There's gonna be plenty of time
to go exploring.

14:38.996 --> 14:42.416
Right now I need you on Enterprise,
down with your engine.

14:43.209 --> 14:46.128
This ship's a little young
to be without her chief engineer.

14:52.927 --> 14:55.137
When I used to dream
about this mission,

14:55.346 --> 14:57.556
the last thing I envisioned
was having a Vulcan onboard

14:57.765 --> 15:01.018
who continuously sucked the air
out of the room.

15:01.226 --> 15:02.811
Well...

15:03.771 --> 15:05.606
...she's right.

15:06.315 --> 15:09.485
Whoever's on that ship
might not want us nosing around.

15:10.652 --> 15:13.405
But I can't assume
that's the case, can I?

15:14.490 --> 15:17.284
Maybe they could use our help.
Computer, pause.

15:17.493 --> 15:21.538
You know... Hey. You know that you
and cheddar don't get along.

15:25.501 --> 15:27.461
Resume personal log.

15:28.587 --> 15:30.130
Before we left, Admiral Forrest said

15:30.339 --> 15:33.300
we'd be making history
with every light-year.

15:34.092 --> 15:37.387
But we're not gonna do that
sitting on our hands.

15:39.097 --> 15:42.059
Computer, pause. Come in.

15:44.269 --> 15:46.396
- Ensign.
- Sorry to bother you, sir.

15:46.605 --> 15:48.774
It's not a problem. Cheese?

15:49.358 --> 15:51.276
No, thank you.

15:51.902 --> 15:54.237
- Everything work out all right?
- Sir?

15:54.446 --> 15:58.492
- With swapping quarters.
- Yes, it's fine. Thank you.

16:01.036 --> 16:02.329
I was thinking, captain,

16:02.537 --> 16:05.832
I might be a lot more helpful to you if
I stay here and keep an open comlink.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.960
That way, I'll have immediate
access to the linguistic database.

16:09.794 --> 16:13.632
Can't you tie your universal translator
into the database through the com?

16:14.382 --> 16:16.885
It's not the same.
The lag time is tripled.

16:18.470 --> 16:22.390
Well, I'd rather wait a few seconds
if it means having you on-site.

16:23.308 --> 16:26.394
For all we know, the UT won't work.

16:26.603 --> 16:29.564
You'll be our only backup.
Anyway, it should be exciting.

16:29.773 --> 16:32.984
Half the crew would give their
eye-teeth to be going over there.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.321
What's wrong?

16:37.989 --> 16:43.411
The environmental suits,
they make me a little claustrophobic.

16:45.163 --> 16:46.873
Claustrophobic?

16:48.291 --> 16:52.503
- And you took a job on a spaceship?
- You talked me into it, remember?

16:52.712 --> 16:56.424
I don't recall reading about any
problems during your zero-G training.

16:56.633 --> 16:59.719
Well, I just... I bit my lip
and got through it.

16:59.927 --> 17:02.847
Well, you're gonna have to
bite your lip again.

17:03.514 --> 17:06.142
I need you over there.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.685
Yes, sir.

17:12.315 --> 17:14.692
What is it, Hoshi?

17:16.319 --> 17:18.404
Is something else wrong?

17:19.070 --> 17:21.199
No, I'd better get back
to the Launch Bay.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.451
Hang on. I'll come with you.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.542
That's the last time, Porthos.

17:37.673 --> 17:41.052
- Going to war, lieutenant?
- Can't be too careful, sir.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.846
You've seen too many
science-fiction movies.

17:44.055 --> 17:46.599
We just need the three phase-pistols.
Put the rifles back.

17:47.767 --> 17:51.187
- What are you rated for?
- I've been cleared on EM sidearms

17:51.395 --> 17:53.063
and class three pulse rifles.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.609
I've never seen one of those.

17:56.817 --> 17:59.987
Malcolm will check you out on it
first chance he gets.

18:01.363 --> 18:04.825
Don't worry. It handles
pretty much like an EM-33.

18:10.706 --> 18:13.959
- Is this necessary?
- Just a precaution.

18:36.148 --> 18:39.026
Just our luck. No release.

18:39.234 --> 18:40.903
Shouldn't be a problem, though.

18:41.111 --> 18:44.698
I can place micro-charges
here and here.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.159
Hold on a second, Malcolm.

19:01.673 --> 19:04.342
- Sorry.
- Enterprise, we've got access.

19:04.551 --> 19:06.678
We're boarding the vessel.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.201
Well, at least we know
they're bipeds.

19:30.410 --> 19:33.371
- What gives you that idea?
- The ladder.

19:34.330 --> 19:35.623
Come on.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.711
Nitrogen-methane atmosphere.

19:41.087 --> 19:44.299
And it's cold, minus 20 degrees.

19:45.758 --> 19:49.554
There's power going through here,
but not much of it.

19:50.263 --> 19:51.848
Captain.

19:59.022 --> 20:01.399
Molecules look like amino acids.

20:02.066 --> 20:03.609
Blood?

20:49.989 --> 20:52.491
Some sort of hydraulics.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.619
Whatever it is, it hasn't
been here very long.

21:11.176 --> 21:14.430
- Hoshi, where are you going?
- I don't think you need a translator.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.974
Stay here.

21:17.182 --> 21:20.561
Their bodies are being flushed out
with some kind of fluid.

21:21.353 --> 21:24.023
- Are they all...?
- All dead, sir.

21:25.274 --> 21:26.817
I'm afraid so.

21:28.277 --> 21:30.320
They're clean.

21:33.198 --> 21:34.908
- How many?
- I don't know.

21:35.117 --> 21:36.869
- About a dozen.
- Fifteen.

21:37.828 --> 21:39.913
They're being drained of something.

21:40.122 --> 21:42.499
Whoever did it
went to a lot of trouble.

21:42.708 --> 21:45.168
My guess is, they're coming back.

21:45.919 --> 21:47.754
We should leave.

21:48.130 --> 21:50.757
There are 15 dead people
over there.

21:51.174 --> 21:53.218
We can't leave.

21:54.177 --> 21:57.055
Your reason for boarding that vessel
was to provide assistance,

21:57.264 --> 21:59.016
if assistance was required.

21:59.224 --> 22:01.977
Clearly, it no longer is.

22:02.185 --> 22:05.147
You're telling me that we should
just leave them there?

22:05.355 --> 22:07.274
What's the alternative?

22:14.072 --> 22:16.992
Your intentions were admirable,
captain.

22:17.701 --> 22:19.327
But nothing can be done
for that crew now.

22:19.536 --> 22:23.081
And if we remain here,
your crew could be put in jeopardy.

22:35.093 --> 22:37.887
- Archer to the bridge.
- Mayweather here, sir.

22:39.639 --> 22:41.599
Go to warp 3.

22:42.517 --> 22:45.019
- Resume course.
- Aye, sir.

22:56.656 --> 23:00.076
Not long after I became a physician,
there was an explosion

23:00.285 --> 23:02.912
on a cargo ship orbiting
my homeworld.

23:03.121 --> 23:05.540
I was part of the first medical team
to arrive.

23:05.748 --> 23:09.961
There were 17 bodies
on the bridge alone.

23:10.586 --> 23:13.923
I'd never seen that many
dead people in one place before.

23:14.424 --> 23:16.175
Very disturbing.

23:16.384 --> 23:18.052
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

23:18.261 --> 23:21.097
I screamed like a 12-year-old.

23:21.305 --> 23:23.099
We're all frightened
by unfamiliar things.

23:23.307 --> 23:28.563
You should be grateful that your
body of experience doesn't include

23:28.771 --> 23:30.481
rooms full of corpses.

23:30.690 --> 23:33.234
Nobody else screamed.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.404
- Has she been eating?
- Not so far.

23:36.612 --> 23:38.781
She has been under
a great deal of stress.

23:38.990 --> 23:42.910
But I'm hoping this protein
concentrate whets her appetite.

23:43.160 --> 23:47.581
I'm a translator. I didn't come out here
to see corpses hanging on hooks.

23:48.082 --> 23:50.876
It goes without saying that you're
going to encounter the unexpected.

23:51.085 --> 23:53.170
Not corpses on hooks.

23:53.379 --> 23:56.715
Have you considered that you might
be happier at the university, teaching?

23:56.966 --> 23:59.593
I did it for years.
It was quite rewarding.

24:03.305 --> 24:05.182
I'm an exo-linguist.

24:05.391 --> 24:07.017
I graduated second in my class,

24:07.226 --> 24:09.520
I spent three years
in Starfleet training,

24:09.728 --> 24:12.940
I was Jonathan Archer's first choice
for this mission.

24:13.566 --> 24:18.570
Every inhabited world we come to
is going to be filled with language.

24:18.779 --> 24:21.907
Some will have hundreds of them.
He needs me here.

24:23.033 --> 24:25.953
If she doesn't take these nutrients,
I'm afraid she won't survive.

24:26.161 --> 24:28.914
- Are you sure that's what she eats?
- It's close enough.

24:31.792 --> 24:34.211
I shouldn't have
brought her onboard.

24:34.420 --> 24:36.630
Maybe I could ask the captain to try to

24:36.839 --> 24:39.550
find a planet with an argon-rich
atmosphere.

24:39.758 --> 24:42.553
It might be easier just
to feed her to my bat.

24:45.722 --> 24:49.685
She needs to get back to an
environment that is more suited to her.

24:50.519 --> 24:53.605
Perhaps someplace
where she could teach.

25:00.487 --> 25:03.365
What kind of pasta is this?
It's great.

25:04.408 --> 25:06.827
Chef told me, I don't remember.

25:07.285 --> 25:10.497
- Not too spicy for you?
- It's fine.

25:11.498 --> 25:13.959
Malcolm's anxious to run
another weapons test

25:14.167 --> 25:16.920
especially after what happened.

25:20.924 --> 25:23.301
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

25:23.510 --> 25:26.763
- Captain?
- Sure, thanks.

25:28.932 --> 25:31.518
I heard they were humanoid.

25:31.726 --> 25:34.437
- Is that right?
- Humanoid.

25:35.730 --> 25:39.859
- Did they look anything like us?
- They were in uniform.

25:41.695 --> 25:45.490
- But you didn't recognize the species?
- They were crewmen.

25:45.698 --> 25:48.868
Murdered on their own ship.
Fifteen dead crewmen.

25:56.626 --> 25:59.629
I detected a stellar nursery
along our present course.

25:59.838 --> 26:03.883
I saw one once through
the big lens outside Anchorage.

26:05.260 --> 26:08.096
A closer view might alleviate
some of the crew's tension.

26:08.346 --> 26:11.683
What's the matter?
The tension bothering you?

26:12.475 --> 26:14.060
Not in the least.

26:15.645 --> 26:19.857
Must be great not to let
things bother you.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.653
No remorse. No guilt.

26:25.405 --> 26:27.365
What if they were Vulcans?

26:27.573 --> 26:29.200
Think you would have reacted
the same way?

26:29.659 --> 26:31.452
They weren't Vulcans.

26:31.661 --> 26:34.747
I said, what if they were Vulcans.

26:34.956 --> 26:38.459
Would you have just left them there,
hanging like slaughtered animals?

26:38.709 --> 26:42.380
Don't you think maybe you would
have taken them down?

26:43.005 --> 26:45.299
Tried to figure out who they were,

26:45.508 --> 26:48.219
made some effort to contact
their families?

26:48.469 --> 26:49.929
We don't know
where they came from.

26:50.137 --> 26:53.599
It would be very difficult
to locate their families.

26:53.808 --> 26:56.060
We didn't even try.

27:00.189 --> 27:03.317
What about you?
What if they were humans?

27:03.526 --> 27:07.446
Would you stick your tail between your
legs and run, leave them there to rot?

27:08.489 --> 27:10.991
Am I the only one who's having
a problem with this?

27:11.200 --> 27:12.993
You said it yourself, sir.

27:13.202 --> 27:16.038
Whoever killed those people
are probably coming back.

27:16.247 --> 27:18.791
So we should avoid
confrontation at any cost.

27:18.999 --> 27:21.543
Is that what you're saying?
Is that what you Vulcans do?

27:21.752 --> 27:25.089
Bury your heads in the sand
and then just fly on by?

27:25.297 --> 27:30.260
We Vulcans would've never gone
onboard that ship in the first place.

27:33.305 --> 27:35.224
You got an answer
for everything, don't you?

27:35.808 --> 27:40.354
We have a code of behaviour,
and we try to obey it.

27:44.149 --> 27:48.821
You may not believe this, but humans
have a code of behaviour too.

27:50.239 --> 27:54.826
It took a few thousand years,
but I think we're starting to get it right.

27:56.119 --> 27:58.288
I can't believe I almost ignored it.

28:01.708 --> 28:02.876
We've reversed course, sir.

28:03.085 --> 28:05.754
We should be back at the coordinates
in five hours.

28:05.963 --> 28:07.923
You have a problem with
the environmental suit?

28:08.131 --> 28:10.258
- Not at all.
- Good.

28:10.467 --> 28:14.179
We're going to need you to examine
the bodies, try to identify their species.

28:14.388 --> 28:17.182
It also wouldn't hurt if you can
figure out what's being done to them.

28:17.390 --> 28:18.683
I'll see what I can do.

28:18.892 --> 28:21.436
You wanted to see what's going on
over there. Now's your chance.

28:21.645 --> 28:25.065
There's no better way to find their
people than through their com system.

28:25.273 --> 28:27.067
You're going to need
to get it up and running.

28:27.275 --> 28:28.360
Aye, sir.

28:28.568 --> 28:30.862
Hoshi will decipher their language
and compose a message.

28:31.071 --> 28:32.697
- Hopefully, it'll make sense.
- Captain...

28:32.906 --> 28:34.950
- I'm sorry, ensign.
- I'll bring a security detail.

28:35.158 --> 28:36.826
There's no one over there
who can hurt us.

28:37.035 --> 28:39.788
Stay here and work on those
targeting scanners.

28:39.996 --> 28:43.625
Prepare to suit up at 1400 hours.

28:45.627 --> 28:47.253
Dismissed.

28:52.217 --> 28:54.719
- How were they killed?
- Different ways.

28:54.928 --> 28:57.889
This one was given a
lethal dose of chloraxine.

28:58.098 --> 29:01.518
The first three back there were shot.
Particle weapons, I believe.

29:02.268 --> 29:05.855
This fellow hasn't suffered
as much cellular decay.

29:06.064 --> 29:08.483
He's our best candidate
for a post-mortem.

29:09.192 --> 29:10.485
Care to assist?

29:23.122 --> 29:24.248
Yeah.

29:30.213 --> 29:32.215
Maybe it's a log. What do you think?

29:32.423 --> 29:35.259
Beats me. Could be a laundry list.

29:35.468 --> 29:38.179
Or instructions on how to
conquer the universe.

29:43.976 --> 29:46.604
The grammar sounds bimodal.

29:46.812 --> 29:49.482
Their transceiver's intact.

29:55.071 --> 29:58.366
Let's hope the next time
we make first contact,

29:58.574 --> 30:02.119
- it isn't with a roomful of corpses.
- Let's hope.

30:05.956 --> 30:07.291
"Ship."

30:09.939 --> 30:11.413
"Ship."

30:12.671 --> 30:14.924
- Just what I thought.
- What?

30:15.132 --> 30:16.509
A zymuth gland.

30:16.717 --> 30:18.385
It releases triglobulin into the blood.

30:18.594 --> 30:20.763
That's what all these tubes
and pumps are about.

30:20.971 --> 30:24.266
Whoever did this is trying
to collect triglobulin.

30:24.475 --> 30:26.810
- What for?
- Oh, any number of reasons.

30:27.019 --> 30:29.146
To create medicines, vaccines.

30:29.355 --> 30:32.900
Some species have even been
known to use it as an aphrodisiac.

30:33.233 --> 30:36.362
- Aphrodisiac?
- It's quite a common practice.

30:36.570 --> 30:38.364
I'm surprised you're
not familiar with it.

30:38.906 --> 30:42.910
Humans used to collect
the bile of black bears,

30:43.118 --> 30:47.664
grind down rhino horns,
things like that, but not people.

30:47.873 --> 30:53.086
It's worth noting that triglobulin is
very similar to human lymphatic fluid.

30:54.463 --> 30:56.507
How long before
the transceiver's online?

30:56.715 --> 30:58.550
A minute or two.

31:00.135 --> 31:01.637
I can't get enough of this.

31:01.845 --> 31:05.974
An alien spaceship sending off
a message to who knows where.

31:06.183 --> 31:09.978
The quicker we get this done, the
quicker we can get back to the ship.

31:10.729 --> 31:12.689
It's your second away mission
in two days.

31:12.898 --> 31:14.649
Yeah, great.

31:14.858 --> 31:17.194
I wish I had an ear for languages.

31:17.402 --> 31:21.031
Captain's gonna need a translator with
him a lot more often than an engineer.

31:21.239 --> 31:23.492
"Distress."

31:27.996 --> 31:30.790
Two other teachers and I
once took a hydro-skimmer out onto

31:30.999 --> 31:34.961
a small tributary in the Amazon.
You know, to see the wildlife.

31:35.170 --> 31:38.673
Sloths, pink dolphins,
all kinds of snakes.

31:38.882 --> 31:41.343
- Wow.
- It gave me the creeps.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.304
If I didn't like being around anacondas,
you can imagine how I feel

31:44.512 --> 31:48.266
about Suliban or whoever
butchered the crew of this ship.

31:51.603 --> 31:54.314
I'm going to ask the captain
to take me home.

31:56.816 --> 31:59.527
- You serious?
- I should've never left the university.

31:59.736 --> 32:02.113
I'm not suited for this.

32:02.822 --> 32:05.366
Give it a try. You'll be fine.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.744
You weren't here yesterday.

32:07.952 --> 32:11.080
I saw those bodies and fell apart.

32:11.539 --> 32:14.209
The captain needs a translator he
can count on, someone who shows

32:14.417 --> 32:17.712
a little grace under pressure.
That isn't me.

32:18.087 --> 32:21.507
- You can't be sure of that.
- Oh, yes I can.

32:23.718 --> 32:25.511
"Distress."

32:31.142 --> 32:32.518
"Distress."

32:33.853 --> 32:36.105
I think I've got it.

32:36.314 --> 32:39.650
"Ship in distress."

32:53.539 --> 32:56.584
- T'Pol to Archer.
- Go ahead.

32:56.792 --> 32:58.377
There's a vessel approaching,
captain.

32:58.586 --> 33:02.048
Its power signatures match the scans
you took of those bio-pumps.

33:02.256 --> 33:05.384
It appears that whoever killed
that crew has returned.

33:05.593 --> 33:07.678
Time to go, doc.

33:13.267 --> 33:16.020
Trip, Hoshi, docking hatch, now.

33:23.777 --> 33:26.405
Distance, 60,000 kilometres.

33:27.364 --> 33:29.491
- Bridge to Armoury.
- Armoury.

33:29.742 --> 33:32.202
We have a potentially hostile
vessel approaching.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.330
Are you prepared
to defend the ship?

33:34.538 --> 33:36.373
That depends.
How long till it gets here?

33:36.582 --> 33:38.417
Ten minutes, maybe less.

33:38.626 --> 33:41.086
Then the answer is most likely no.

33:41.295 --> 33:43.547
The scanners are
still out of alignment.

33:43.756 --> 33:46.008
Look, if you wanted me to hit
a stationary dairy barn,

33:46.216 --> 33:48.802
then I could accommodate you.
But not a moving vessel.

33:49.011 --> 33:52.389
Do the best you can. But I need you
on the bridge in five minutes.

33:56.643 --> 33:59.646
Archer to T'Pol.
Deploy the docking arm.

34:00.731 --> 34:03.609
- Arm extended.
- How close are they?

34:03.901 --> 34:07.154
- Eight thousand kilometres.
- What kind of weapons?

34:07.362 --> 34:09.947
Our sensors can't penetrate
their shielding.

34:10.197 --> 34:12.367
- Have you tried hailing them?
- Yes.

34:12.576 --> 34:15.411
- There's been no response.
- Try again.

34:21.877 --> 34:24.004
The pod's on the arm.

34:24.755 --> 34:28.216
T'Pol to Archer.
They're still not responding.

34:28.925 --> 34:30.886
They're charging weapons.

34:33.179 --> 34:34.431
They're targeting our engines.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.601
We're almost in.
Stand by to jump to warp.

35:03.376 --> 35:05.170
Doors.

35:18.391 --> 35:21.102
Archer to the bridge.
It doesn't feel like we've gone to warp.

35:21.311 --> 35:23.980
Our port nacelle
has been damaged.

35:25.898 --> 35:28.443
Have Malcolm arm the torpedoes.

35:34.407 --> 35:36.701
- Report.
- We're dead in the water, sir.

35:36.909 --> 35:40.079
They seem to have stopped firing.
They're closing on our position.

35:40.288 --> 35:42.957
- Malcolm?
- Both forward tubes loaded and ready.

35:45.418 --> 35:48.379
- Stand by starboard tube.
- Yes, sir.

35:49.172 --> 35:50.673
Fire.

36:02.101 --> 36:03.436
Stand by port tube.

36:03.644 --> 36:05.479
- Ready.
- Fire.

36:14.655 --> 36:16.574
Trip, warp status?

36:16.782 --> 36:18.659
The nacelle's been
completely depolarized.

36:18.868 --> 36:20.494
I'm afraid we're stuck here
for a while.

36:26.834 --> 36:30.713
- What was that?
- Submolecular bio-scan.

36:30.921 --> 36:33.382
You've been probed, ensign.

36:33.966 --> 36:35.968
We've all been probed.

36:36.176 --> 36:38.679
They've no doubt discovered that
your lymphatic systems contain

36:38.887 --> 36:40.931
some useful compounds.

36:49.606 --> 36:53.360
Get to the Armoury.
Start distributing hand weapons.

36:53.569 --> 36:56.739
Post security teams at lev...

36:57.781 --> 36:59.783
Sir, another vessel
just dropped out of warp.

36:59.992 --> 37:02.953
- They're on an intercept course.
- Let's see it.

37:07.457 --> 37:10.419
- They're hailing us.
- Put it up.

37:14.756 --> 37:16.758
- Captain?
- He's from the same species

37:16.967 --> 37:18.218
as the murdered crew.

37:18.427 --> 37:20.429
They must have picked up
your distress call.

37:22.055 --> 37:25.475
Tell him the ship above us killed
the crew of the cargo vessel.

37:25.684 --> 37:27.936
They're about to do the same to us.

37:31.773 --> 37:34.693
I told him what you said, sir,
but I doubt it made any sense.

37:35.485 --> 37:37.863
- What do you mean?
- This isn't exactly Spanish

37:38.071 --> 37:41.825
we're dealing with here. I'd be lucky
if I'm getting half the vocabulary right.

37:47.497 --> 37:50.542
They've locked onto us with
some kind of stabilizing beam.

37:50.750 --> 37:52.919
Use the impulse engines.
Get us the hell out of here.

37:53.128 --> 37:56.214
I can't, sir. Their beam's disrupting
all our propulsion systems.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.096
It seems he got the part about
killing the cargo ship crew,

38:03.304 --> 38:06.516
but he believes we did it, sir.
At least I think he does.

38:06.725 --> 38:09.227
Tell him we sent the distress call.

38:09.769 --> 38:12.814
Why would we kill his people
and then do that?

38:18.403 --> 38:20.613
I think I understood this one.
He says the distress call

38:20.822 --> 38:24.993
- came from his ship, not ours.
- We needed their frequencies.

38:25.201 --> 38:27.579
Going there was
the only way to find them.

38:32.583 --> 38:33.918
Something about DNA scans.

38:34.127 --> 38:36.087
He wants to know why we
were there two years ago.

38:36.296 --> 38:39.632
- Two years ago?
- He probably means two days, sir.

38:39.841 --> 38:42.427
The phonetic processor's still
having trouble locking on.

38:45.555 --> 38:48.850
I'm not certain, but I don't think
he's gonna help us.

38:49.058 --> 38:51.060
They're 50 metres above us.

38:51.269 --> 38:52.603
Forty-nine.

38:54.647 --> 38:56.399
The pumps.

38:57.567 --> 39:01.737
Tell them to run scans on the
bio-pumps hooked up to the corpses.

39:01.946 --> 39:04.073
They'll see they're not
our technology.

39:04.282 --> 39:06.534
Have them compare
the power signatures

39:06.742 --> 39:08.995
to the ship that's about to
land on our roof.

39:09.245 --> 39:10.913
Where are they, Malcolm?

39:11.163 --> 39:12.999
They've stopped at about ten metres.

39:17.003 --> 39:18.838
I'm having trouble with
the word "pump," sir.

39:19.046 --> 39:21.298
I've got the processor searching
for synonyms.

39:23.759 --> 39:25.928
The translator's not making
a lot of sense to him, sir.

39:26.137 --> 39:29.348
He's getting frustrated. I think he's
running out of patience, captain.

39:29.557 --> 39:32.143
Then forget the translator.
Do it yourself.

39:32.351 --> 39:34.395
- Do what myself?
- Talk to him.

39:34.854 --> 39:36.939
That's impossible, sir.

39:37.147 --> 39:40.234
I haven't even learned
their basic conjugations.

39:40.484 --> 39:42.778
Talk to him, Hoshi.
It doesn't have to be perfect.

39:42.987 --> 39:45.781
You don't understand.
I don't even know how to say "pump."

39:45.990 --> 39:50.286
I'll get it all wrong,
it'll just make things worse.

39:50.536 --> 39:53.664
- Things can't get much worse.
- Sir.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.797
Captain, they've started
drilling into the hull.

40:03.715 --> 40:07.803
Hoshi. Hoshi, I need you to do this.

40:08.011 --> 40:09.805
We all do.

40:10.430 --> 40:11.765
That's why you're here.

40:40.836 --> 40:42.295
Again.

41:02.107 --> 41:03.566
What did he say?

41:08.071 --> 41:09.489
Ensign.

41:18.248 --> 41:21.417
They're targeting
the vessel above us.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.466
- We've got impulse back.
- Move us away.

41:28.675 --> 41:32.303
Captain, I may be wrong, but I think
I've got the scanners aligned.

41:32.512 --> 41:35.139
- Permission to launch a torpedo.
- Granted.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.823
Nice of them to wait till we got clear.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.950
All stop.

42:01.207 --> 42:04.085
I think we may have
just made a friend.

42:06.462 --> 42:08.256
Thanks to you.

42:14.929 --> 42:18.224
Captain's starlog. May 6th, 2151.

42:18.432 --> 42:20.810
After helping them recover
their dead crewmen,

42:21.018 --> 42:24.105
we had a chance to spend
some time with the Axanar.

42:24.313 --> 42:28.109
Turns out they're androgynous
and live over 400 years.

42:28.317 --> 42:31.946
I look forward to meeting them again,
under better circumstances.

42:32.154 --> 42:36.242
Before we resume our course,
I've agreed to make a brief detour.

42:52.174 --> 42:55.386
This isn't exactly like the place
you came from,

42:55.886 --> 42:58.013
but it's close enough.

42:58.472 --> 43:00.933
It's not that hard to adapt.

43:04.061 --> 43:06.814
You're gonna do just fine here.
