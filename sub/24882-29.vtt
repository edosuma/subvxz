00:16.633 --> 00:17.567
Hello there!

00:17.633 --> 00:19.567
I am so excited

00:19.633 --> 00:20.867
because today,

00:20.934 --> 00:23.367
we are learning
all about-- Oh!

00:23.433 --> 00:24.767
Oh, my. Look, look.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.734
It is an adorable,
little bubble.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.700
Hello, little bubble.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.467
Guess what, little bubble.

00:30.533 --> 00:31.767
Today, we are learning all--

00:31.834 --> 00:33.834
No.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.800
We are learning
all about you today!

00:36.867 --> 00:39.266
Bubbles. Ugh.

00:39.333 --> 00:40.834

Come all...

01:17.600 --> 01:19.700
To Sesame Street's
first-ever...

01:19.767 --> 01:21.600
- bubblefest!
- Bubblefest!

01:21.667 --> 01:22.734
It will be
a bubbly fest...

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
of bubbly feats...

01:23.867 --> 01:24.934
never before seen...

01:25.000 --> 01:27.133
- on Sesame Street!
- on Sesame Street!

01:27.200 --> 01:28.633
Elmo loves bubbles.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.567
Yeah, me, too!

01:30.633 --> 01:32.767
Me, three!
Bubbles are excellent!

01:32.834 --> 01:35.367
Oh, ho! Then you are
in the right bubblefest,
my friend.

01:35.433 --> 01:38.633
But first, who here has
actually blown a bubble?

01:38.700 --> 01:40.367
- I have.
- Elmo has, Elmo has!

01:40.433 --> 01:41.934
I've blown big bubbles!

01:42.000 --> 01:43.867
- Ah!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:43.934 --> 01:46.667
You mean to tell me
bubbles aren't magic?

01:46.734 --> 01:48.400
Bubbles are not magic.

01:48.467 --> 01:52.266
Anybody can blow a bubble,
like you or you.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.700
Ha! Or even you!

01:53.767 --> 01:56.967
And we're gonna
show you how right now!

01:57.033 --> 01:58.834
I'm so excited.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.834
I've never blown
a bubble before.

02:00.900 --> 02:02.233
Ha ha! Me neither!

02:02.300 --> 02:04.133
My mommy always
makes them for me.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.500
Watch closely, everyone.

02:06.567 --> 02:07.934
The trick
to blowing bubbles

02:08.000 --> 02:10.166
is to first dip
your wand

02:10.233 --> 02:11.734
into the bubble mix.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.734
The mix, please, Chris.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.767
The mix, Alan.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.800
Then you slowly blow

02:16.867 --> 02:19.033
into the center
of the wand and...

02:20.600 --> 02:22.133
- Bubbles!

02:22.200 --> 02:23.600
Telly: Look at that,
look at that!

02:23.667 --> 02:24.834
All right,
bubble blowers.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.567
- You give it a try!
- All right, you guys try.

02:26.633 --> 02:27.567
Hey, Lamar.
You try. Come on.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.667
Give it a try.

02:29.734 --> 02:30.834
Alan: All right. Let's see it.

02:30.900 --> 02:31.834
Go, lamar.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.266
Alan:
Oh, there it is!

02:35.333 --> 02:37.667
Hey, bubble-icious
bubble blowing, Elmo!

02:37.734 --> 02:38.767
Ah, thank you.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.667
OK. My turn.

02:40.734 --> 02:43.066
Remember, Abby.
Slow and steady.

02:43.133 --> 02:44.367
- Go ahead, Chris.
- OK.

02:48.433 --> 02:51.300
Abby did it! Ha ha ha!

02:51.367 --> 02:53.266
I made bubbles
without magic!

02:53.333 --> 02:54.433
- Cool!
- Telly: Oh, boy!

02:54.500 --> 02:57.266
I bet I'm gonna be
an awesome bubble blower!

02:57.333 --> 03:01.667
Stand back, everybody,
and watch the bubbles fly!

03:01.734 --> 03:05.467
Thank you.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.867
Hey. Where's the bubbles?

03:09.934 --> 03:11.834
Well, try again, Telly.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.533
It didn't work!

03:15.600 --> 03:17.233
Sorry, Telly.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.233
I'm not giving up.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.166
This is bubblefest!

03:21.233 --> 03:24.100
I've got to figure out how
to blow a bubble for bubblefest!

03:24.166 --> 03:26.166
- For bubblefest!
- For bubblefest!

03:26.233 --> 03:28.300
Good luck, Telly!

03:28.367 --> 03:30.233
And now, bubble buddies,

03:30.300 --> 03:34.066
it's time for...
a bubble mix mystery.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.367
Ooh!

03:35.433 --> 03:36.734
Elmo: Well, what's
a bubble mix mystery?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.133
Ooh!

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200
It's the mystery...

03:39.266 --> 03:40.266
of how to make...

03:40.333 --> 03:41.333
- the...
- perfect...

03:41.400 --> 03:42.433
- bubble mix!
- bubble mix!

03:42.500 --> 03:45.100
Whoa! How do you make
the perfect bubble mix?

03:45.166 --> 03:46.233
Yeah!

03:46.300 --> 03:49.100
Alan and Chris:
Let's... solve that mystery!

03:52.433 --> 03:53.367
Bubble solution is
a mix

03:53.433 --> 03:55.600
made of three ingredients:

03:55.667 --> 03:56.567
Chris: water...

03:58.934 --> 04:00.100
soap...

04:02.367 --> 04:05.266
and something
called "corn syrup."

04:07.533 --> 04:09.133
Now, did any
of these ingredients

04:09.200 --> 04:10.633
make bubbles
by themselves?

04:10.700 --> 04:11.834
- No.
- No.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.166
Alan: But you
put them all together,

04:13.233 --> 04:14.166
and they form...

04:14.233 --> 04:16.033
a bubble solution.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.367
Ooh!
Isn't that mysterious?

04:18.433 --> 04:19.600
Elmo thinks so.

04:19.667 --> 04:21.266
Yeah, me, too.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.734
Now, in order to make
our bubble solution,

04:22.800 --> 04:25.333
one ingredient goes
into the large cup,

04:25.400 --> 04:27.467
Chris: one goes
into the medium cup...

04:27.533 --> 04:30.000
and one goes
into the small cup.

04:30.066 --> 04:33.834
But--but which ingredients go
into which measuring cup?

04:33.900 --> 04:37.066
Ah. That's
the bubble mix mystery.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.600
Ooh!

04:38.667 --> 04:41.533
Oh. Well, Elmo thinks
that the soap should be

04:41.600 --> 04:43.166
in the large cup
because bubbles

04:43.233 --> 04:44.433
come from soap.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.066
OK, so, soap
into the large cup.

04:47.133 --> 04:48.500
Alan: There it goes.

04:48.567 --> 04:49.800
That's soapy right there.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.233
- And we're good!
- There we go!

04:51.300 --> 04:53.233
OK. And I think
that maybe the water

04:53.300 --> 04:55.066
should go
in the medium cup.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.433
Alan: All right.
Water in the medium cup.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.266
Chris: OK. There goes our water.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.567
Elmo: OK. And the syrup goes
into the small cup.

05:02.633 --> 05:05.200
- All right.
- Corn syrup in the small cup.

05:05.266 --> 05:06.667
- Elmo: Yeah
- Alan: There it goes

05:06.734 --> 05:08.100
Abby:
Ooh. That's gloppy.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.567
Alan:
That is a little gloppy.

05:09.633 --> 05:11.300
Elmo:
Gloppy, gloopy.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.500
- All right!
- All rightie. Now...

05:13.567 --> 05:15.734
Alan and Chris:
Let's... test that mix!

05:15.800 --> 05:18.600
Oh, cool! Ha ha ha!

05:18.667 --> 05:20.033
OK. Pour, pour,
pour, pour.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.500
♪ Pour, pour, pour, pour ♪

05:21.567 --> 05:23.033
- Boy, oh, boy.
- Wow, that's cool.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.633
Awesome.
- Yeah.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.767
Check this out.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.533
Ooh! OK.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.667
Abby: Mix it up.

05:28.734 --> 05:29.800
Alan: Just a stir.

05:29.867 --> 05:31.667
- ♪ Stir, stir, stir ♪
- Ooh.

05:31.734 --> 05:35.166
OK. Testing wand, please.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.433
Yeah!

05:37.767 --> 05:40.233
Ah-ha. Now...

05:41.900 --> 05:43.533
- Oh!
- Hmm. Wait.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.200
Come on. Aw.

05:46.266 --> 05:47.200
Well, it worked,

05:47.266 --> 05:49.100
but it didn't make
that many bubbles.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.700
Yeah. I wonder why
it didn't work so well.

05:51.767 --> 05:54.200
Well, maybe it has
too much soap in it.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.066
Maybe.
Let's try a new mix.

05:56.133 --> 05:57.533
- Yeah.
- New mix!

05:57.600 --> 05:58.533
New mix!

05:58.600 --> 06:00.633
New mix!

06:00.700 --> 06:04.233
OK. Since there was
so much soap last time,

06:04.300 --> 06:07.400
maybe we should put the soap
in the medium cup.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.967
- Ah.
- Chris: OK.

06:09.033 --> 06:10.834
Soap into the medium cup.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.533
Check!

06:12.600 --> 06:14.233
Ah. OK.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.567
And corn syrup
in the small cup.

06:17.633 --> 06:21.033
Corn syrup
in the small cup. Check.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.533
Ha ha ha! Which means
the water is

06:24.600 --> 06:26.567
- for the large cup.
- Yes.

06:26.633 --> 06:30.233
Water for the large cup.
Check, check!

06:30.300 --> 06:32.800
Elmo: There you go!

06:32.867 --> 06:35.033
Ah...looks good.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.133
Yeah, yeah.
It's gonna be a good mix.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.367
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

06:37.433 --> 06:40.533
- And now...
- Both: Let's... test that mix!

06:40.600 --> 06:42.667
- OK.
- All right.

06:42.734 --> 06:44.200
All right.

06:44.266 --> 06:45.300
I got a good feeling
about this one.

06:45.367 --> 06:46.700
There goes that syrup.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.767
- OK.
- I'll get my spoon here.

06:48.834 --> 06:49.867
Getting the spoon. OK.

You guys did it.

07:07.166 --> 07:09.767
You solved
the bubble mix mystery!

07:09.834 --> 07:12.100
All: Ooh!

07:12.166 --> 07:13.734
OK. OK, OK, OK, OK.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.667
I am ready.

07:15.734 --> 07:18.166
Abby: To play the tuba?

07:18.233 --> 07:19.400
No, no, no, no, no.

07:19.467 --> 07:20.567
To blow bubbles.

07:20.633 --> 07:23.467
Alan, you hold up the wand
with the mix,

07:23.533 --> 07:25.967
and I will blow
at it with the tuba.

07:26.033 --> 07:27.433
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.266
OK, bubblefest fans.

07:29.333 --> 07:32.100
Let's see if Telly can
blow a bubble with the tuba.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.667
- Yeah.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.700
Aw. No bubbles.

07:41.767 --> 07:43.133
Nope.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.600
Ohh. Well, don't worry.

07:44.667 --> 07:47.033
I will blow bubbles yet.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.333
I have to!

07:48.400 --> 07:51.133
This is bubblefest!

07:51.200 --> 07:53.133
- Bubblefest!
- Bubblefest!

07:53.200 --> 07:55.834
And speaking of bubblefest,
it's time for...

07:55.900 --> 07:57.567
Both:
A bubblefest riddle!

07:57.633 --> 07:59.200
Oh, yay!

07:59.266 --> 08:00.834
What's round and wet...

08:00.900 --> 08:02.767
is something you blow...

08:02.834 --> 08:06.066
Both: ...And has all
the colors of the rainbow?

08:06.133 --> 08:07.667
Oh. Well,
something you blow.

08:07.734 --> 08:09.166
Ooh! Elmo knows,
Elmo knows!

08:09.233 --> 08:11.200
Ooh! You can blow
into a straw,

08:11.266 --> 08:13.667
a rainbow-colored straw.

08:13.734 --> 08:16.333
Yeah, but, Elmo,
a straw isn't really round.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.567
Oh, yeah.

08:17.633 --> 08:19.166
How about a balloon?

08:19.233 --> 08:21.400
Well, a balloon is round,
but is it wet?

08:21.467 --> 08:23.600
Oh, no, but

08:23.667 --> 08:25.266
A beach ball is!

08:25.333 --> 08:27.433
Well, yeah, a beach ball
is only wet

08:27.500 --> 08:29.233
when you put it
in water.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.600
Oh, boy. This is hard.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.033
Can we have a hint?

08:32.100 --> 08:35.700
Well, it is bubblefest.

08:35.767 --> 08:38.133
- Hey, Elmo.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.266
I think the answer
has something to do

08:39.333 --> 08:41.333
with bubbles.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.734
Bubbles? But Elmo knows
bubbles are clear, Abby.

08:44.800 --> 08:48.100
Yeah, but the hint was
bubblefest,

08:48.166 --> 08:50.100
and bubbles are
round and wet,

08:50.166 --> 08:51.100
and you blow them, huh?

08:51.166 --> 08:52.600
Yeah, well.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.066
I think the answer has
something to do with bubbles.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.300
Well, Elmo doesn't
think so, but let's try.

08:57.367 --> 08:59.700
Um, is the answer bubbles?

08:59.767 --> 09:01.400
Oh... ding,
ding, ding, ding!

09:01.467 --> 09:02.734
The answer is...

09:02.800 --> 09:03.800
- bubbles!
- Bubbles!

09:03.867 --> 09:05.800
- Oh, yay!
- Hey, wait a minute.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.633
Ah. Don't just take
our word for it.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.433
Observe the bubbles.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.433
- Elmo: Let's see.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.934
Watch.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.300
- Wow!

09:16.367 --> 09:19.767
Abby:
Oh, I see red!

09:19.834 --> 09:20.767
Elmo:
Wow! That's cool!

09:20.834 --> 09:21.767
Elmo sees blue!

09:21.834 --> 09:23.367
Abby:
Oh, and green!

09:23.433 --> 09:25.100
Abby: Ohh! Purple!

09:25.166 --> 09:27.667
Wow! Bubbles are
lots of colors.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.467
That's because
bubbles are iridescent.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.433
Huh?

09:32.500 --> 09:33.633
Iridescent.
That means you can see

09:33.700 --> 09:36.233
all the colors of the rainbow
on the bubble.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.333
- Yeah.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.133
Ooh! Iridescent!

09:39.200 --> 09:40.800
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

09:40.867 --> 09:42.500
And that brings us to...

09:42.567 --> 09:43.734
♪ Dum dum dum ♪

09:43.800 --> 09:46.333
- the bubblefest finale!
- The bubblefest finale!

09:46.400 --> 09:47.533
Well, what's the...

09:47.600 --> 09:48.667
♪ Dum dum dum ♪

09:51.400 --> 09:53.133

09:54.266 --> 09:55.600
so enormous...

09:55.667 --> 09:58.900
that you could fit
a human child inside!

09:58.967 --> 10:00.033
Hubba

10:00.100 --> 10:03.300
You're gonna need
a magic wand for that!

10:03.367 --> 10:04.667
Oh, no magic.

10:04.734 --> 10:05.867
Just a volunteer.

10:05.934 --> 10:07.734
Oh, oh. Me!

10:07.800 --> 10:10.433
Great, Crystal!
Hey. Walk this way.

10:13.800 --> 10:17.834
OK, Crystal.
Now take off your shoes.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.467
That's right. OK.
And now we're gonna step

10:19.533 --> 10:20.967
into the center of the pool.

10:21.033 --> 10:23.300
- There we go.

10:23.367 --> 10:24.633
Help you. There we go.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.667
- Cool!
- OK, guys.

10:26.734 --> 10:27.700
We're gonna do this
on the count of three.

10:27.767 --> 10:28.734
Ready?

10:28.800 --> 10:32.266
- One...
- All: One, two, three!

10:36.333 --> 10:38.400
- Whoa!
- They did it!

10:38.467 --> 10:40.166
Yeah!

10:40.233 --> 10:41.967
Crystal was
inside a bubble!

10:42.033 --> 10:43.633
- Let's go, let's go!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10:43.700 --> 10:45.567
That was
really cool, Crystal.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.467
- Yeah.
- OK. All right.

10:47.533 --> 10:49.367
OK. OK, everybody.

10:49.433 --> 10:51.266
This is gonna work.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.800
I'm gonna blow bubbles.

10:52.867 --> 10:56.567
Watch this, and here we go.

10:56.633 --> 10:58.333
Whoaaaa!

11:00.300 --> 11:01.567
Is Telly all right?

11:01.633 --> 11:04.567
I'm all right.

11:04.633 --> 11:06.633
I just can't do it.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.166
I can't blow bubbles.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.934
Whoa! Did you see that?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.367
Do it again,
Telly. Do it again.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.700
I'm doing it!
I'm blowing bubbles!

11:21.767 --> 11:23.467
All: Yay!

11:23.533 --> 11:26.233
And with that, it's time
to bring bubblefest to an end.

11:26.300 --> 11:29.066
With a bubbling
bubblefest salute.

11:29.133 --> 11:31.166
Both:
Everybody make bubbles!

11:31.233 --> 11:32.266
Whoo-hoo!

12:41.567 --> 12:44.133
Have you ever blown a bubble?

12:44.200 --> 12:46.834
Have you ever
made one pop?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.300
If you've ever played
with bubbles,

12:49.367 --> 12:51.467
you might never want to stop.

12:51.533 --> 12:55.033
They are pretty,
they are shiny.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.100
They can fly beneath the sun.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.000
You can blow them
in the water

13:00.066 --> 13:01.633
for some underwater fun.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.700
There are other
kinds of bubbles,

13:05.767 --> 13:08.166
not just the kind you blow.

13:08.233 --> 13:09.867
Come with me,
and I will show you

13:09.934 --> 13:12.333
all the bubbles
you should know.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.200
Bubbles live in liquids.

13:14.266 --> 13:16.166
You might find them
in your sink.

13:16.233 --> 13:20.066
They can make a bath
more festive

13:20.133 --> 13:23.166
or bring some fizzy
to your drink.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.000
There's one more kind of bubble

13:32.066 --> 13:34.233
made out of bubblegum.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.700
If you're careful
when you chew it,

13:36.767 --> 13:39.066
these bubbles can be fun.

13:39.133 --> 13:41.367
So, go and blow some bubbles.

13:41.433 --> 13:43.433
Watch them float
into the sky,

13:43.500 --> 13:46.400
and your friends will love
the bubbles, too,

13:46.467 --> 13:49.266

Why can't I catch a bubble
without it popping?

Hey, guys. How do
you catch a bubble?

15:34.200 --> 15:35.700
Teacher and Students:
Let's find out!

15:35.767 --> 15:37.033
- Yeah!
- Ovejita: Hee hee hee!

15:42.500 --> 15:44.266
See if you can catch one
without making it pop.

15:46.633 --> 15:47.633
I popped that one.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.000
I got a tiny one there.

15:54.834 --> 15:55.934
Teacher: Why do you think
they pop?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.367
They do pop really easily.

15:57.433 --> 15:58.367
A lot of bubbles popped.

15:58.433 --> 15:59.767
We kept a few, right?

15:59.834 --> 16:00.867
Because they're soap.

16:00.934 --> 16:01.967
So bubbles are made
out of soap,

16:02.033 --> 16:03.867
and why do you think
they're popping?

16:03.934 --> 16:06.333
Because it's a really
thin layer of just stuff

16:06.400 --> 16:08.633
and there's air inside it
and there's air outside it.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.200
I think we could set up
an experiment to see

16:11.266 --> 16:13.533
if there are some surfaces
that bubbles will land on

16:13.600 --> 16:16.066
better than
on other surfaces.

16:16.133 --> 16:18.467
Oh, boy! We're gonna do
an experiment to see if we can

16:18.533 --> 16:19.900
catch some bubbles!

16:19.967 --> 16:23.133
In order to catch a bubble,
you can choose from

16:23.200 --> 16:25.400
Murray:
the soapy water, the gloves,

16:25.467 --> 16:27.367
the dirt, the aluminum foil,

16:27.433 --> 16:29.500
and the plain water.

16:29.567 --> 16:32.333
Bronwyn, what are you gonna
choose to catch a bubble?

16:32.400 --> 16:34.867
I think I'll have
to go with the dirt.

16:34.934 --> 16:36.500
Go for it, Bronwyn.

16:36.567 --> 16:38.066
Ha ha! Yeah.

16:38.133 --> 16:39.367
Those are some
nice dirty hands.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.767
Good luck!

16:40.834 --> 16:41.800
What did you choose?

16:41.867 --> 16:43.133
I chose dirt.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.133
What do you think's
gonna happen?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.800
I think it will stay
for a few seconds,

16:45.867 --> 16:47.000
but not
for a long time.

16:47.066 --> 16:48.567
OK. Let's give it a try.

16:54.233 --> 16:55.467
- No.
- Don't work.

16:55.533 --> 16:57.600
Aw. The dirt didn't work.

16:58.900 --> 17:00.367
George, what are you
gonna choose?

17:00.433 --> 17:01.800
I'm gonna choose
the tinfoil.

17:01.867 --> 17:03.333
Ooh! Go for it, George!

17:03.400 --> 17:04.300
Good luck!

17:07.767 --> 17:11.467
Murray: George caught it
with the tinfoil! Yes!

17:11.533 --> 17:13.433
Sam, what are
you gonna choose?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.600
I think I'll
choose soapy water.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.300
Go for it, Sam.

17:17.367 --> 17:19.166
Good luck, sam.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.133
Murray:
The soapy water worked.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.533
Gus, what are you
gonna choose?

17:24.600 --> 17:26.300
The gloves.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.333
OK. Take the gloves and try
to catch those bubbles.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.500
Aw. The gloves didn't work.

17:38.567 --> 17:41.233
All right, Eva and Hannah,
one choice left.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.033
You get the water.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.500
Go for it.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.500
All right, guys.
Go catch those bubbles.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.667
Oh, ha ha ha!

17:54.734 --> 17:56.367
Eva: It worked!

17:56.433 --> 17:59.133
Murray: Wow! So some materials
make the bubble pop...

18:01.667 --> 18:03.266
and some don't!

18:06.500 --> 18:09.467
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

18:09.533 --> 18:10.467
I did it!

18:10.533 --> 18:11.533
I caught a bubble!

18:11.600 --> 18:12.533
Ha ha ha!

18:12.600 --> 18:13.734
Ovejita: hee hee hee!

Wow! Elmo loves bubbles

20:46.433 --> 20:49.400
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:49.467 --> 20:52.233
Oh, let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

Smartie, hi!

21:03.767 --> 21:06.633
Whoa! Can't stop!

21:06.700 --> 21:08.500
- Oh!
- Wow!

21:10.266 --> 21:12.133
Well, that was fun!

21:12.200 --> 21:14.367
Bubbles really
blow me away.

21:14.433 --> 21:15.834
Oh, ho ho! Yeah!

21:15.900 --> 21:18.133
Oh, Smartie is just in time

21:18.200 --> 21:21.266
because Elmo wants to learn
more about bubbles.

21:21.333 --> 21:24.367
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:24.433 --> 21:27.567
Both:
We look it up!

21:27.633 --> 21:29.100
Searching for bubbles.

21:29.166 --> 21:30.133
Here we go.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.700
Bubbles are round and wet.

21:35.767 --> 21:37.467
Bubbles are filled with air,

21:37.533 --> 21:40.166
and you can find them
in lots of places

21:40.233 --> 21:43.300
like in your milk.

21:43.367 --> 21:47.300
Elmo:
Or in a piece of gum.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.867
Bubbles can be
all different sizes,

21:49.934 --> 21:53.734
and they can be lots
of fun in baths

21:53.800 --> 21:56.266
like when you make
a bubble beard!

21:59.200 --> 22:02.166
Wow! Oh, thanks
for teaching Elmo

22:02.233 --> 22:04.333
all about bubbles!

22:04.400 --> 22:08.367
Whoa! Looks like it's time
for me to float away.

22:08.433 --> 22:09.734
Bye-bye, Elmo.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.333
Oh, ho ho! Bye-bye.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.200
Thanks, Smartie.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.233
Boy, Elmo loves bubbles--

22:16.300 --> 22:18.734
Oh, especially
when they pop.

22:18.800 --> 22:23.200
Hey! That gives Elmo an idea.

22:23.266 --> 22:25.700
Oh, come on.
Let's play a game together.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.467
Yeah! Come on, come on.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.800
Elmo: Oh, ho! Let's see
how many bubbles

22:33.867 --> 22:35.767
we can pop together!

22:35.834 --> 22:40.767
Come on. Count the bubbles
with Elmo. Ha ha!

22:40.834 --> 22:46.400
Elmo and kids:
One, two, three, four,

22:46.467 --> 22:50.734
five, six, seven, eight...

22:50.800 --> 22:52.700
Kid:
They're going faster!

22:52.767 --> 22:54.166
Elmo:
Oh, you're right.

22:54.233 --> 22:56.834
Elmo needs to pop
the bubbles really fast.

22:56.900 --> 23:00.300
Elmo and kids:
Nine, ten, 11, 12,

23:00.367 --> 23:02.233

23:09.767 --> 23:11.633
Elmo:
Yay! We did it!

23:11.700 --> 23:14.000
We popped all the bubbles!

23:14.066 --> 23:15.700
Yeah!

23:15.767 --> 23:18.400
Boy, bubbles are amazing.

23:18.467 --> 23:22.300
Oh, and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:22.367 --> 23:25.433
Oh. What does Mr. Noodle
know about bubbles?

23:25.500 --> 23:26.767
Oh, let's ask him.

Mr. Noodle!

23:34.133 --> 23:35.266
Mr. Noodle,
Elmo's wondering.

23:35.333 --> 23:37.667
Do you know
what a bubble is?

23:37.734 --> 23:40.066
Elmo:
You do? Oh, cool!

23:40.133 --> 23:42.600
Can you make a bubble
for us, Mr. Noodle?

23:42.667 --> 23:45.767
Kid:
Yeah. Make a bubble!

23:45.834 --> 23:47.800
Kid 2:
He has tools!

23:47.867 --> 23:50.667
Elmo: Do you make
a bubble with tools?

23:50.734 --> 23:54.667
Kid: No. That's not
how you make a bubble.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.700
Elmo:
Oh, are you OK?

23:56.767 --> 23:58.767
OK. Elmo will give you a hint.

23:58.834 --> 24:01.767
You need air
to make a bubble.

24:01.834 --> 24:04.600
Yeah, air.

24:04.667 --> 24:07.133
Kid: He's blowing
himself up with air.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.400
Elmo: That's not a bubble,
Mr. Noodle.

24:10.467 --> 24:12.800
Kid:
No. That's his clothes.

24:12.867 --> 24:15.633
Elmo: Those are
your clothes, Mr. Noodle.

Kid: He's doing it.
He blew a bubble.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.233
Elmo:
That's right, Mr. Noodle.

24:25.300 --> 24:29.667
