02:54.600 --> 02:56.795
Honey, jiggle the handle.

03:03.196 --> 03:04.914
Can't we get that fixed?

03:04.979 --> 03:07.614
After our down-payment,
we've got about eight dollars left.

03:07.849 --> 03:09.720
All right, then we'll jiggle.

03:12.821 --> 03:16.221
Mark.
Whoa, Mark.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.973
- We have to go to work.
- I am working.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.669
Are you sure
you want to do this?

03:22.970 --> 03:26.770
I never realized living
in an apartment was so inhibiting.

03:27.461 --> 03:29.870
All these walls are ours.

03:30.479 --> 03:32.766
Makes me want to go out
and buy handcuffs.

03:35.362 --> 03:39.558
- I love this house.
- Oh, I can't believe we got in.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.600
There was only a five-minute
dip in the market.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.072
And you were right on top of it.

03:44.698 --> 03:46.390
- You know what I want to do?
- What?

03:47.091 --> 03:49.591
I want to buy one of those big,
vulgar televisions.

03:49.598 --> 03:53.145
Oh, yeah, and those tacky,
pink flamingos for the lawn.

03:53.246 --> 03:54.946
Are those pink flamingos deductible?

03:54.957 --> 03:56.952
We can deduct
that shit out of everything.

03:56.953 --> 04:01.291
Oh, oh, Mark, oh...

04:10.980 --> 04:12.915
- Oh, rats.
- What?

04:12.916 --> 04:15.316
Well, these are all postmarked
three weeks ago.

04:15.468 --> 04:16.624
Did you call the post office?

04:16.636 --> 04:18.855
Yes. I called the post office.
I sent forms,

04:18.856 --> 04:22.256
I sacrificed small animals
in front of the mailbox.

04:22.539 --> 04:25.621
- Who do you know in New Jersey?
- I do not know. Let me see.

04:25.770 --> 04:27.983
- Is it an old girlfriend?
- Could be.

04:29.205 --> 04:31.418
Oh, wait.
It's my cousin Fred.

04:32.222 --> 04:33.367
You never mentioned a "Fred".

04:33.368 --> 04:35.768
Oh yeah, sorry.
"Ever Ready Freddy"? Come on.

04:36.353 --> 04:40.145
Hey, guess what? He and his wife
want to spend their vacation with us.

04:40.157 --> 04:41.897
That sounds fun. When?

04:43.463 --> 04:44.550
Today.

04:51.329 --> 04:54.263
Are you sure they wouldn't be
more comfortable in a hotel?

04:54.275 --> 04:57.270
Jessie...
It's just house guests.

04:57.567 --> 04:58.841
It'll be fun.

05:01.242 --> 05:02.042
Bye.

05:03.444 --> 05:06.409
Oh, I do not know, Mark.
It sounds like a disaster to me.

05:06.421 --> 05:08.496
Oh, come on, Wes,
we're talking five days.

05:08.531 --> 05:13.045
Yeah? Chernobyl only took 5 minutes, pal,
and it didn't come into LAX at rush hour.

05:13.098 --> 05:14.164
This is family.

05:14.165 --> 05:15.765
- Good morning, Pepie.
- Good morning, Mark.

05:15.798 --> 05:18.259
- Has the Grindle meeting started yet?
- Just now.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.660
I give it three minutes.

05:19.694 --> 05:23.773
- What are you talking about?
- Markisson is going to woof it.

05:23.969 --> 05:25.765
- Busted his ass on this.
- Oh yeah?

05:25.766 --> 05:29.216
Right now he is asking everybody
to turn to page 6 in their prospectus...

05:29.223 --> 05:31.114
I changed my mind.
One minute.

05:31.230 --> 05:34.900
- What's wrong with page 6? Mark?
- Morning Lory, copy those, please.

05:34.901 --> 05:35.601
Mark?

05:35.619 --> 05:38.693
Right now he is suggesting a major
investment in Slaughter Security.

05:38.770 --> 05:40.892
- So?
- So, Grindle caught his second wife...

05:40.893 --> 05:43.393
in the merger mode
with one of their junior executives.

05:43.493 --> 05:45.263
- Forget it!
- Bob, I'm sorry.

05:45.264 --> 05:47.064
Now I know we can
work something out here.

05:47.107 --> 05:49.781
- We can explore...
- Nobody explores with my ass, Brooks.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.282
Bring around my car.

05:51.468 --> 05:52.228
Bob, please.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.055
12 percent growth with companies
that don't sleep with my wife.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.042
It is a simple thing to ask.

05:58.104 --> 06:00.670
- I can get you that, Mr. Grindle.
- Who the hell are you?

06:00.671 --> 06:03.371
- Mark Bannister, sir.
- He's one of our brightest, Bob.

06:03.417 --> 06:05.348
Now I know, sir, Martensen
was somewhat adventurous.

06:05.349 --> 06:09.556
But I guarantee you I can build you
a portfolio that's not only conservative,

06:11.857 --> 06:12.857
but aggressive.

06:13.034 --> 06:15.737
You'll be earning 14%,
in three months.

06:15.949 --> 06:16.954
14?

06:20.099 --> 06:23.821
Okay, last chance. Amaze me.

06:25.678 --> 06:28.656
I want your suggestions for a
new portfolio on my desk by closing...

06:32.065 --> 06:34.762
I can't believe you want to
get in bed with Bob Grindle.

06:34.774 --> 06:36.111
I'm not going to wind up like Markisson.

06:36.123 --> 06:39.940
- And Croft and Gervitz...
- I am in complete control.

06:42.632 --> 06:46.424
Jacob, do you want a timeout?
Go sit in the car and wait for me.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.411
Excuse me, what's your
secret summer fantasy?

06:49.546 --> 06:50.946
Chloroform.

06:52.650 --> 06:54.121
A date with Tom Cruise.

06:54.503 --> 06:55.729
A date with Tom Cruise...

06:56.412 --> 07:00.474
Enemy space people
come down in this big space ship

07:00.475 --> 07:02.875
and eat my mom and dad.

07:02.895 --> 07:05.095
What's your secret summer fantasy?

07:05.114 --> 07:07.285
If you've got a question,
Los Angeles, let me know.

07:07.297 --> 07:08.680
I'll find the answer.

07:08.758 --> 07:10.391
- Karen?
- That was Jessica Bannister,

07:10.403 --> 07:13.541
our question girl.
Thanks, Jessica.

07:13.854 --> 07:18.194
Coming up next,
some hot ideas on how to stay cool.

07:18.195 --> 07:19.195
Clear.

07:25.986 --> 07:26.886
Oh, Jessie?

07:29.548 --> 07:30.791
Hi Russel, what's up?

07:34.001 --> 07:37.879
I'm... I'm thinking about trying you out
on the Eight o'Clock Report.

07:38.392 --> 07:39.676
That's great!

07:39.688 --> 07:43.475
But it's a harder news hour, so we'll
have to toughen your image a little.

07:43.566 --> 07:45.976
Oh, I can do that.
I think I can work on that.

07:46.077 --> 07:48.977
- I'd like to go over some questions.
- I can do that.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.072
What?

07:53.937 --> 07:55.696
I can't believe I put off Russel Fenn,

07:55.697 --> 07:57.997
when he wanted to talk to me
about getting me my big break.

07:58.174 --> 08:01.093
I'm sorry, I just wanted us to make the
in-person airport gesture.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.986
I know you didn't mean it,
it's okay, I'm fine.

08:02.987 --> 08:03.887
Thank you.

08:04.339 --> 08:07.770
Wait till you get a hold of this guy
he used to have girls hanging all over him.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.422
Is that him?

08:11.144 --> 08:12.044
No.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.350
Here comes a good-looking guy.
Is this him?

08:18.351 --> 08:20.051
No, he's too young.

08:20.111 --> 08:24.742
- Well, you look that young. You do.
- Well, thank you.

08:38.888 --> 08:39.886
Fred?

08:40.322 --> 08:42.149
- Pudge?
- Pudge?

08:45.763 --> 08:49.698
- Hi. How are you?
- God, it's great to see you.

08:53.811 --> 08:55.512
- It's my wife, Bernice.
- Bernie.

08:55.513 --> 08:58.213
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi. Oh, we're family.

08:58.751 --> 09:01.195
You know, I've heard
so much about you.

09:01.478 --> 09:04.356
- Hi there, I'm Jessie.
- Hi.

09:04.466 --> 09:07.827
She looks just like a movie star,
doesn't she?

09:07.828 --> 09:12.480
- Much better. You see our TV's...
- Honey they don't want to hear about our TV.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.675
Tell them the big news.

09:15.628 --> 09:17.423
- We're uh...
- Pregnant!

09:17.835 --> 09:19.767
That's great, congratulations.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.968
Well, we do have something
to celebrate then.

09:22.046 --> 09:23.338
The TV station
that Jessie works for

09:23.339 --> 09:25.739
is just about to give her
a very big promotion.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.316
And Mark got a major assignment
this morning.

09:28.756 --> 09:30.247
I just got canned.

09:32.121 --> 09:33.360
Let's get the luggage.

09:33.374 --> 09:35.065
- Oh yeah, there's another one.
- I got it.

09:35.066 --> 09:37.766
The decorative lid.
They were out of zebra.

09:39.553 --> 09:41.305
Whoa, what have you got here,
bowling balls?

09:41.306 --> 09:42.206
Uh, yeah.

09:55.755 --> 09:58.060
Yes, wait.
Move everybody out.

09:58.061 --> 10:00.731
That's the one,
move everybody out!

10:00.752 --> 10:05.757
Baby, you made it.
Yeah you did, little one.

10:05.991 --> 10:08.893
Come on, boy. Come on.

10:09.094 --> 10:12.394
Did your little ears explode?

10:12.414 --> 10:14.570
Fred, you didn't
mention anything about a cat.

10:14.582 --> 10:17.358
Scruffy Bannister,
meet your cousins.

10:17.436 --> 10:20.324
Mark and Jessie.

10:21.994 --> 10:25.964
Oh no, no, no.
It's an inexpensive dress really...

10:26.025 --> 10:27.959
- You're okay, aren't you?
- No.

10:39.487 --> 10:42.649
Is this terrible heat bothering you?

10:42.750 --> 10:45.350
You don't look so good, Baby.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.901
So, Fred. What did you do
before you got laid off?

10:49.313 --> 10:51.863
I worked in a
sewage treatment plant, Pudge.

10:52.146 --> 10:53.999
You know, the best part
about that whole job was

10:54.000 --> 10:56.500
that I would keep any goodies
that came down the pipes.

10:57.146 --> 10:58.651
Sounds, uh, great.

10:58.752 --> 11:03.952
Yeah, one time I found a genuine
snakeskin wallet with $80 in it.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.522
Had to clean it up though.

11:08.495 --> 11:10.678
I can't believe this traffic.

11:10.687 --> 11:14.766
- Oh my God, Scruffy's going on the run.
- Don't let him get under our seat.

11:14.801 --> 11:16.089
God, he looks nauseous.

11:18.690 --> 11:19.990
What the hell?

11:20.010 --> 11:22.291
I'm so sorry, Scruffy's never
been carsick before.

11:22.292 --> 11:23.492
It's in my ear.

11:23.493 --> 11:26.093
Look, the windows are stuck,
he has puked...

11:28.933 --> 11:31.091
I can't believe that that stomach
could hold so much.

11:31.092 --> 11:33.592
A little Club Soda
will take that right out.

11:37.193 --> 11:38.893
Go play, hon.

11:46.240 --> 11:49.467
Oh, earth tones.
Hides the dirt.

11:50.284 --> 11:53.132
Well.
Welcome to L.A.

11:53.798 --> 11:56.338
- Yeah, it's...
- What?

11:56.539 --> 11:58.639
- Nothing.
- No, no, no, no, no. What?

11:58.740 --> 12:00.640
It's a little small.

12:00.998 --> 12:04.556
- Smaller than we pictured.
- Awfully small.

12:05.790 --> 12:08.061
Come on.
I'll show you your room.

12:08.444 --> 12:09.948
Well, here we are.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.584
Bernice?
Is this okay?

12:18.600 --> 12:22.815
Oh sure. I mean I don't mind
sleeping on a... tofu...

12:23.316 --> 12:25.116
if the baby doesn't.

12:27.855 --> 12:31.137
I cannot believe you gave them
our bedroom, Mark!

12:31.538 --> 12:37.182
- Our little haven of privacy.
- I'm sorry. But she is pregnant after all.

12:37.682 --> 12:39.922
It's obviously been
a little rough on Fred too.

12:40.683 --> 12:42.609
I don't know,
maybe this was a bad idea.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.549
You see the guy in there?
He's a wreck!

12:44.750 --> 12:48.550
Like some sort of pod-version
of the Fred I grew up with.

12:49.462 --> 12:53.694
- Mark, it is only for five days.
- That's right, it is.

12:53.705 --> 12:56.967
And they are trying to be nice.
I mean Fred gave us these watches.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.177
Cartiers, I can't believe
he could afford them,

12:59.178 --> 13:01.578
he just lost his job
fishing stuff out of the sewer.

13:11.861 --> 13:14.366
I'm sorry we lost touch like that,
you know?

13:14.774 --> 13:15.984
- Hey!
- What?

13:16.185 --> 13:17.785
"Polar Bear Squad"

13:17.993 --> 13:20.489
- Okay.
- Ready?

13:28.342 --> 13:31.490
All right.
Can't run from them forever.

13:43.756 --> 13:44.657
What?

13:46.027 --> 13:48.253
Well, we're family, right?

13:48.531 --> 13:50.789
So I'm just going to
come on out and ask you.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.411
Your nose.
How much did it cost?

13:54.554 --> 13:56.590
- What?
- Oh, come on.

13:56.591 --> 13:58.991
I saw that nose in Cosmo.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.651
Yeah, I know you all do it out here,
that's fine.

14:01.752 --> 14:04.052
Bernice, I did not have my nose done.

14:04.273 --> 14:06.369
Right.
Sorry.

14:08.917 --> 14:10.700
You don't have to be ashamed of me, Hon.

14:10.701 --> 14:13.501
It's only the trained eye of a beautician
that can see that.

14:13.826 --> 14:18.127
You know, we got
this great guy in Trenton, Dr. Nick.

14:18.128 --> 14:19.828
I've been thinking
of getting it done myself.

14:19.849 --> 14:23.880
Honestly, maybe just a little bob, you know,
something to lift my eyes up, show my teeth.

14:24.159 --> 14:26.450
Cute.
Excuse me one second.

14:26.485 --> 14:28.803
Yeah, my cousin Ronda
went to Dr. Nick.

14:28.804 --> 14:32.204
Got a free set of Ginsu knives
and her old nose in a jar of formaldehyde.

14:32.277 --> 14:34.564
- I'll get us a couple of fresh ones.
- Okey-dokey.

14:35.569 --> 14:37.339
I think I know
what's wrong with Fred.

14:37.740 --> 14:40.240
Hey Pudge, remember
the Oboikski twins?

14:41.104 --> 14:42.405
"Pudge"?
What is this "Pudge" deal?

14:42.406 --> 14:43.906
- Why does he call you "Pudge"?
- Nothing.

14:43.956 --> 14:46.218
- Why do you call him "Pudge"?
- Nothing.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.393
Nothing.

14:51.198 --> 14:52.580
- Is that you, sweetie?
- Yes.

14:52.581 --> 14:55.181
- Oh my God!
- Hey Pudge.

14:55.907 --> 14:58.211
Horizontal stripes...

14:58.833 --> 15:00.120
Which one are you, Fred?

15:00.121 --> 15:03.021
- I believe I'm off the camera here.
- See him blow the thing in my face.

15:03.222 --> 15:07.522
- How many reels of the stuff did you bring?
- A couple dozen.

15:08.723 --> 15:10.623
You're a barrel of laughs.

15:13.505 --> 15:14.366
Hey.

15:17.367 --> 15:21.967
I'm sorry.
My God, did you ever do anything but eat?

15:22.528 --> 15:24.332
Well apparently not.

15:27.076 --> 15:29.151
You know when you told me
that you were big for your age,

15:29.152 --> 15:31.452
I thought you meant you were tall.

15:33.834 --> 15:38.834
- Oh, God, what are you doing?
- Mark you have breasts.

15:39.143 --> 15:40.883
Oh, it's a game we used to play.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.491
Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.

15:50.810 --> 15:54.015
I'm going to get something to drink.
All right?

15:56.767 --> 15:58.658
Grab a snack while you're there.

16:39.356 --> 16:42.369
All right.
Strike three, he's out of there.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.770
Hey Pudge.
Never lost that old pitching arm, huh?

16:49.879 --> 16:53.988
Rise and shine, lazy bones.
We got a big day ahead of us.

16:55.336 --> 16:56.436
We do?

17:03.808 --> 17:05.633
Hey, watch the vulva.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.895
- It's not working.
- Stop jiggling, I'm kind of gassy.

17:11.922 --> 17:14.422
- Fred, he's going to drop her.
- No more. I feel sick.

17:18.352 --> 17:21.806
Graumann's Chinese.
I always wanted to eat here.

17:22.289 --> 17:26.636
Joan Crawford. She used to beat the kids
with like coat hangers. Come on.

17:29.137 --> 17:32.528
Oh, Fred.
You're pressing on my prenatal boobs.

17:39.682 --> 17:42.608
Come on, squeeze in, squeeze in.
All right, everybody say "trick".

17:46.653 --> 17:48.392
Hon, you got the traveler's checks?

17:48.731 --> 17:51.906
You put them in your pocket this morning.
I watched you.

17:55.353 --> 17:59.958
- Did you call the traveler's check people?
- Their machine said they're on vacation.

17:59.989 --> 18:01.507
They'll be back after labor day.

18:01.598 --> 18:05.494
You know I told him not to buy them
from some guy in the Kmart parking lot.

18:05.559 --> 18:06.495
Good morning.

18:07.096 --> 18:09.296
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:10.347 --> 18:11.491
What's this?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.044
It is an itinerary.

18:13.045 --> 18:16.045
You know Jessie and I aren't going to be
able to see everything with you guys.

18:16.078 --> 18:18.405
And we don't want you
to miss any of the hot spots.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.671
Probably take you the rest of your vacation
just to see all of that.

18:21.992 --> 18:26.032
Geez, there's a lot of great stuff on here.
But we're broke.

18:27.828 --> 18:29.046
Thanks anyway.

18:29.862 --> 18:32.616
- Here.
- No, no, no, Mark. No, no.

18:32.617 --> 18:34.317
- Oh Fred, come on.
- I couldn't, Mark, I couldn't.

18:34.318 --> 18:35.018
Fred...

18:35.094 --> 18:38.899
We'd rather spend the rest of our vacation
just sitting right here.

18:39.773 --> 18:41.642
- We not insist.
- Take my car.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.904
Ah, yes.

18:53.505 --> 18:54.724
You know something?

18:54.825 --> 18:57.125
That was the best $300
we ever invested.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.067
Mark?

18:59.568 --> 19:01.668
When do your cousins get back?

19:02.646 --> 19:04.455
Not for several hours.

20:14.564 --> 20:16.026
Forget it. Yes.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.399
Jessa?

20:19.922 --> 20:21.405
Oh shit, that's my sister.

20:21.406 --> 20:23.706
- Oh, no, no!
- It's my sister.

20:24.705 --> 20:28.472
- Honey my clothes, hurry.
- I'll get rid of her.

20:28.473 --> 20:29.773
The pants, the pants.

20:31.084 --> 20:33.515
Okay. Just tell her we're not here.

20:34.051 --> 20:35.355
Jessa!

20:41.751 --> 20:46.943
- Claudia, this is not a good time.
- Kaddir kicked me out!

20:47.460 --> 20:48.857
Jessa!

20:57.927 --> 21:00.302
So then Kaddir didn't actually
kick you out of the house.

21:00.303 --> 21:01.703
That is a matter of opinion.

21:01.767 --> 21:03.608
Let's put it this way:
does he even know you're gone?

21:03.693 --> 21:06.274
He barely knows I'm alive.
He cut my allowance.

21:06.315 --> 21:08.281
He cut her allowance, Honey.

21:09.202 --> 21:10.782
To what?
$9000 a month?

21:10.799 --> 21:12.525
Makes me drive his
old Jaguar.

21:12.637 --> 21:14.559
You know Claudia, some people
have worse problems.

21:14.582 --> 21:17.149
- Like who?
- Like people who don't have cars.

21:17.161 --> 21:18.326
Who cares about them?

21:18.404 --> 21:20.579
Yes, hello.
Hi, Kaddir.

21:20.882 --> 21:23.113
Yes, salom back at you.
Uh-huh.

21:23.125 --> 21:25.022
- He found your note.
- I won't talk to him.

21:25.144 --> 21:28.597
Right, yeah. She's...
He just wanted to know if you were here.

21:28.598 --> 21:30.398
- Why?
- Why?

21:31.849 --> 21:33.768
To let you know
he canceled your credit cards.

21:33.780 --> 21:36.489
What?
That Middle Eastern maggot.

21:36.615 --> 21:38.404
- Okay. He wants to talk to you.
- He can talk to my lawyer.

21:38.405 --> 21:39.805
The nerve of that towel-head.

21:39.916 --> 21:42.591
Oh, yes, she is very upset
about your little love spat, Kaddir.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.092
Right, I...
Uh-huh.

21:44.256 --> 21:47.217
He says he will forget everything, if you
just go home and fix dinner for him.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.962
Oh grind some glass, Ayatollah!

21:49.374 --> 21:50.935
Jessie, turn down the TV,
would you, babe?

21:50.936 --> 21:51.836
- Give me that phone.
- No. No.

21:51.837 --> 21:55.037
- Kaddir, she's too grief-stricken right now.
- Give it to me, Mark. Hand over...

21:56.023 --> 22:00.032
Hello Kaddir. No you listen.
I cannot live on that.

22:00.033 --> 22:02.033
I cannot live on that.

22:02.410 --> 22:05.597
Do not speak Farsi to me, Kaddir.
Stop it.

22:05.599 --> 22:07.825
All right, that's it.
That is it!

22:07.826 --> 22:10.026
- I want a...
- ...don't say it!

22:10.027 --> 22:12.027
- I want a...
- ...nice Dega Painting in the bathroom

22:12.028 --> 22:13.328
- I want...
- ...don't!

22:13.529 --> 22:15.029
A divorce.

22:21.374 --> 22:24.552
- Honey, wait. Just wait.
- She said the D-word again, Jessie.

22:24.553 --> 22:27.453
- Yeah, but she didn't mean it this time.
- Bullshit. She means it every time.

22:27.492 --> 22:29.319
She is going to a hotel, right?

22:29.501 --> 22:31.181
Jessie, no, we are not taking her in.

22:31.241 --> 22:32.048
Oh come on, Mark.

22:32.049 --> 22:33.349
If you can have
your idiot cousin stay with us

22:33.356 --> 22:35.263
then we can certainly
take in my poor sister

22:35.264 --> 22:37.464
who has been thrown out on the street
without a nickle.

22:37.545 --> 22:40.937
Jessa? You wouldn't happen to have
any good Scotch, would you?

22:56.136 --> 22:57.297
Put it over here.

22:59.331 --> 23:00.331
A little more this way.

23:04.701 --> 23:09.354
- A couple of days, Claudia, that's it.
- As if I wanted to live in a garret.

23:09.881 --> 23:14.503
Now madam, if you need anything else
don't hesitate... to get it yourself.

23:14.681 --> 23:16.069
Get out.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.143
I missed you.

23:29.396 --> 23:30.497
Mark?

23:31.698 --> 23:34.098
How anybody with half a brain...

23:34.493 --> 23:38.824
...could drop a whole day's
worth of film into the La Brea Tar Pits...

23:39.837 --> 23:41.386
Stop with the eeking.

23:41.387 --> 23:43.987
You get hit by Shamu once
you think you're a porpoise.

23:45.995 --> 23:47.212
Jessa?

23:47.430 --> 23:50.769
Could you go ahead?
I don't want to strain my uterus any more.

24:10.433 --> 24:12.815
I didn't know anybody's eyes
could be that red.

24:12.916 --> 24:14.516
Boy, those are bulging out.

24:14.603 --> 24:17.078
Well what was I supposed to think?
They looked insane.

24:17.179 --> 24:20.079
We're not insane.
We're from New Jersey.

24:20.908 --> 24:22.387
Yeah, the Garden State.

24:27.635 --> 24:32.210
Deja-vu.
You two have the same nose.

24:32.324 --> 24:34.724
They must have had a
two-for-one special, huh?

24:34.925 --> 24:36.125
What?

24:36.132 --> 24:38.341
You know.
At the chop-shop.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.750
I told that butcher
not do make it too perfect.

24:40.755 --> 24:43.616
Oh no, wait honey,
he didn't make it too perfect.

24:43.617 --> 24:45.600
She just has some
bizarre nose fetish.

24:45.607 --> 24:48.303
See, he left one nostril
a little bit bigger than the other.

24:48.347 --> 24:50.107
I had a deviated septum,
I had to get it fixed.

24:50.108 --> 24:51.108
Excuse me.

24:51.578 --> 24:52.722
You know, I was thinking.

24:52.723 --> 24:56.823
Maybe I can interview you two for this new
budget beauty book I'm trying to write.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.101
I'm going to call it
"Pretty for Peanuts".

24:59.102 --> 25:01.402
- Get it?
- Play with the cat, Bernice.

25:01.744 --> 25:05.663
- Where is Scruffy? Scruffy Bannister?
- He was in the kitchen.

25:06.264 --> 25:07.864
It's too perky.
I hate perky.

25:07.865 --> 25:10.565
No, it's perfect.
I didn't say perky, I said perfect.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.343
Dear God,

25:30.344 --> 25:34.144
here lies the body of
Scruffy Bannister,

25:34.245 --> 25:36.745
our beloved companion.

25:37.311 --> 25:40.298
$42 worth of angelfish.

25:40.446 --> 25:43.190
This is ridiculous.
Why don't we just flush it down the toilet?

25:43.191 --> 25:44.891
Not our toilet.

25:46.225 --> 25:50.930
Why? Why do you always
take the good ones?

25:57.314 --> 26:00.427
Sleep well, little prince.

26:24.026 --> 26:26.696
Mark.
There's something in there.

26:27.497 --> 26:28.497
Mark.

26:36.558 --> 26:37.545
God.

27:11.010 --> 27:13.233
Honey, Honey! Look!
The dead cat! It's alive!

27:13.245 --> 27:14.953
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

27:17.389 --> 27:19.738
Whoever is down there,
I'm carrying an Uzi.

27:22.499 --> 27:23.891
Scruffy.

27:24.500 --> 27:28.196
Oh, baby.
It's a miracle.

27:28.979 --> 27:33.297
Mom is so sorry for burying you alive.

27:33.598 --> 27:35.498
Yes she is.

27:35.631 --> 27:38.249
P.U.
Is that you or this kitchen?

27:41.792 --> 27:45.019
No, no, Anthony listen to me.
Forget Tropic Core, okay?

27:45.024 --> 27:47.459
Orange juice stock isn't worth a shit
after the cold and flu season.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.904
Also I noticed the collar
on TNT is coming down,

27:49.905 --> 27:51.805
I want a thousand shares
once it hits Bernice.

27:52.325 --> 27:53.548
Yeah, what?

27:53.949 --> 27:56.749
I'm sorry, no.
Once it's 99. Yes, thank you.

27:57.287 --> 27:58.527
Um, Mark?

27:58.828 --> 28:01.428
Stark wants to see an update
on the Grindle portfolio.

28:01.505 --> 28:02.809
Oh, yes.

28:07.075 --> 28:08.676
- Wait a second, pal.
- What?

28:08.677 --> 28:09.777
You're shedding.

28:10.097 --> 28:12.781
Oh, Jesus.
It's Felix the Rat.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.559
You know something?
I opened a can of peaches last night,

28:14.560 --> 28:15.960
there was cat hair inside of it.

28:15.961 --> 28:17.961
I've been coughing up furballs
for the last two nights.

28:17.977 --> 28:19.940
So when do you get rid
of these people?

28:21.052 --> 28:22.143
Today.

28:22.173 --> 28:24.001
Oh listen,
give me another hug.

28:24.013 --> 28:24.722
You know what?

28:24.723 --> 28:27.523
When the baby comes, we're going to
have to all come out and visit you again.

28:27.570 --> 28:30.627
Or pictures. You know pictures are worth
a thousand words.

28:30.678 --> 28:33.853
...a little baby camera on his shoulders
during the birthing process.

28:33.854 --> 28:35.754
But I'm going to cover up
all my unmentionables...

28:35.775 --> 28:38.647
Oh, please do, please, honey, yeah.
Bye Bye.

28:38.649 --> 28:41.569
I had so much fun, oh my God.
I'm going to miss everything...

28:41.587 --> 28:45.651
- I know this wasn't easy for you guys...
- Oh, no. It wasn't... Come on.

28:45.652 --> 28:47.952
No, Bernice can be a little handful.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.834
Listen, you're going to have to
come out and visit us.

28:49.835 --> 28:51.235
We will.
Really, we will.

28:51.236 --> 28:52.236
I'm going to
show you the Turnpike,

28:52.237 --> 28:54.537
it's beautiful like
in the spring and fall.

28:54.556 --> 28:56.217
- I can't think of anything...
- I'm going to miss you.

28:56.218 --> 28:58.218
Hey, Fred, come here
and say goodbye.

28:58.228 --> 29:00.044
Go, hon, goodbye.

29:00.045 --> 29:01.145
All right, Bernice,
you're going to be late, honey.

29:01.146 --> 29:03.046
- You take care, honey.
- I will.

29:07.648 --> 29:10.648
- I'm on... I'm on the ground.
- Honey!

29:11.633 --> 29:13.250
Don't move your head.
Don't move your head, Bernice.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.251
- Honey, are you all right?
- Wait, wait, don't touch her.

29:15.342 --> 29:17.342
Quick, check and see
if anything fell out.

29:17.560 --> 29:19.582
Oh, God,
I'm going to have a flat baby.

29:20.129 --> 29:21.326
I'm going to call my doctor.

29:21.327 --> 29:26.027
No. No LA quacks. I need
my real doctor. Call Dr. Jack Penix.

29:27.513 --> 29:29.218
Oh, my God,
oh my God!

29:29.219 --> 29:32.519
I can feel the insides exploding.
I know what I'm doing.

29:34.579 --> 29:37.736
Yes, Trenton, New Jersey,
for a Dr. Jack Penix.

29:38.314 --> 29:39.818
With an X!

29:43.002 --> 29:45.094
Don't touch me.
Get away.

29:45.129 --> 29:46.715
Where are you going?

29:47.867 --> 29:51.281
He said we need to get her to the
nearest bed as quickly as possible.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.740
Okay. Okay, that's fine.

29:54.868 --> 29:57.039
No Mark. it isn't fine.
She has to stay here.

29:57.217 --> 29:59.222
Well yes,
of course she'll stay here.

29:59.787 --> 30:03.096
- How long?
- For the rest of her pregnancy.

30:03.097 --> 30:04.397
- No...
- No!

30:05.332 --> 30:08.219
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.415
I lost all feeling in my womb.

30:11.516 --> 30:12.516
Here.

30:12.884 --> 30:17.158
How am I supposed to
stay like this for six months?

30:17.176 --> 30:19.350
Oh, this is just stupid. I'm going to
go get my doctor, Bernice.

30:19.394 --> 30:23.055
No! Never. I need a man of science,
not some ass-lifter.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.786
Whatever we do
has to real cheap.

30:25.877 --> 30:30.356
Since I lost my job, no...
medical coverage.

30:38.614 --> 30:41.375
Hi, Mr. Bannister.
Want to bounce?

30:41.528 --> 30:43.437
No Katie.
There are laws.

30:43.702 --> 30:46.401
C.K., how many times did I tell you
not to play with dolls?

30:46.402 --> 30:47.625
Come on, go watch your sister.

30:47.637 --> 30:48.642
Dale?

30:48.643 --> 30:51.943
So what's the problem, Bannister?
Espresso machine down again?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.351
No, No, no.

30:53.429 --> 30:55.660
Did you put more artichoke leaves
down your disposal?

30:55.661 --> 30:56.861
No.

30:57.595 --> 30:58.843
What's the problem?

31:00.070 --> 31:01.639
How's that? All right?

31:01.640 --> 31:03.340
Lower, you ape.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.983
- Don't get excited, honey.
- Guess what?

31:05.014 --> 31:07.487
- What?
- I got my first period today.

31:09.753 --> 31:10.549
That ought to do her.

31:10.750 --> 31:13.920
No thanks necessary.
Just name the little bugger after me.

31:13.946 --> 31:17.445
Yeah, Sluggo Bannister.
Right.

31:19.141 --> 31:22.703
I feel like a human swing set here.
Fred, don't touch that.

31:24.638 --> 31:27.356
You know I could
dry-wall her into your basement.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.138
I'll keep that in mind, Dale.

31:35.614 --> 31:37.357
We never should have come, Pudge.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.718
Fred, stop talking like that.

31:39.797 --> 31:44.446
And also, please. Do me a favor.
Don't call me "Pudge" anymore.

31:44.547 --> 31:45.347
Okay.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.894
"Stretch".
Look at you.

31:50.103 --> 31:53.412
You're living the life.
You've got a nice house.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.913
You paid a little bit too much,
but it's still very nice.

31:56.934 --> 31:59.255
Real estate market
has gone crazy out here.

31:59.496 --> 32:01.286
You're important at your office.

32:02.304 --> 32:04.417
And you've got a wonderful wife.

32:05.756 --> 32:06.574
Yeah.

32:09.622 --> 32:11.453
To wonderful wives.

32:13.884 --> 32:16.315
Bernice is giving me cancer.

32:17.811 --> 32:20.429
Would you stop talking like that.
Would you listen to yourself?

32:20.430 --> 32:21.730
Do you know what your problem is?

32:21.807 --> 32:26.391
You let that woman walk all over you.
You've got to stand up to her.

32:27.456 --> 32:29.138
What the hell happened to
the Fred I knew in high-school?

32:29.141 --> 32:31.466
The Fred that could have any girl
in the senior class he wanted to.

32:31.467 --> 32:33.667
When he was a freshman.

32:34.591 --> 32:37.983
A guy who could break up
any class without even trying?

32:39.153 --> 32:42.993
I don't know.
Somewhere between graduation...

32:43.632 --> 32:45.511
and the Jerry Lewis telethon.

32:46.893 --> 32:48.328
I just lost it.

32:54.460 --> 32:58.930
Hear that? Bernadette.
Remember her?

32:59.631 --> 33:00.731
What was her last name?

33:01.452 --> 33:03.009
Moisecracket,
Bernadette Moisecracket,

33:03.010 --> 33:05.110
Her father owned the battery shop
outside of town?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.367
- Beverly.
- No, Bernadette. Don't you remember?

33:07.379 --> 33:09.761
- Beverly.
- We did the choreography for her.

33:09.844 --> 33:11.397
You did the...
You built the dance routine.

33:11.398 --> 33:13.098
You started it
in gym class.

33:13.579 --> 33:16.520
It started like this. The thrusting.
The pelvis thrusting thing.

33:16.559 --> 33:19.221
- No.
- Well come on, show me how it started.

33:19.222 --> 33:20.022
You thought it up.

33:20.023 --> 33:22.923
Get your hemorrhoids off the bar stool,
come show me to it started.

33:23.812 --> 33:24.930
Come on, come on, come on.

33:27.931 --> 33:30.531
Hey!
Come on.

33:35.132 --> 33:36.032
Yeah.

33:36.574 --> 33:38.692
Get it in. Get it tight.
Get it greasy.

33:46.767 --> 33:47.858
All right, come on.

34:22.359 --> 34:24.359
Hey Baby, say hello to the King.

34:31.782 --> 34:33.483
Ready for takeoff.

34:59.590 --> 35:02.391
A little rusty.
It took me a while to get going.

35:02.456 --> 35:05.617
What you have,
you don't lose.

35:08.157 --> 35:09.257
Way to go.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.632
- Jessie!
- What?

35:16.633 --> 35:17.833
- He's gone.
- Who's gone?

35:17.867 --> 35:20.298
Fred is gone.
He ran away.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.937
I've been abandoned.

35:23.568 --> 35:25.951
No wait.
Now Bernice we don't know that for sure.

35:26.063 --> 35:30.212
I went to find the Fred Bannister
I used to be.

35:30.382 --> 35:32.465
Where did he get that crap?

35:38.067 --> 35:38.867
Fred!

35:41.568 --> 35:43.268
Fred!

35:50.869 --> 35:53.069
- Fred!
- Fred!

35:57.047 --> 35:59.838
- What did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.

36:00.008 --> 36:03.539
All I said to him was that maybe he should
try standing up for himself once in a while.

36:03.616 --> 36:05.077
You saw what a wreck he was.

36:05.182 --> 36:08.348
Yes, Mark, but he was her wreck,
she liked him like that.

36:08.631 --> 36:11.226
She craves human sacrifice,
and he was it.

36:11.992 --> 36:13.409
Let's just call the police.

36:13.575 --> 36:15.883
A guy skips out on his wife,
they're going to rush right over.

36:15.884 --> 36:17.384
Okay then let's hire a detective.

36:17.419 --> 36:18.632
We can't afford that, Honey.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.730
All right, then maybe we can talk
Claudia into watching after Bernice

36:21.731 --> 36:22.628
while we work.

36:22.663 --> 36:25.484
Are you serious? Your sister would
smother the woman in her sleep.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.561
- We should have taken care of it.
- Mark! Oh, Mark!

36:32.662 --> 36:35.962
How the hell am I supposed to pee?

36:47.723 --> 36:49.819
You deal with your evil twin.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.835
Oh for God's sake
Don't make me do this.

36:57.015 --> 37:00.734
Wouldn't you just this once
like to handle something like an adult?

37:00.969 --> 37:01.760
No.

37:03.291 --> 37:06.460
- Pouting makes wrinkles.
- Oh Jessa, please.

37:06.461 --> 37:10.201
I know that by the end of the week
he will be in his knees begging.

37:19.728 --> 37:22.011
That gate was not here yesterday.

37:22.597 --> 37:25.116
Neither was Slaughter Security.

37:29.755 --> 37:31.929
Kaddir is Jessie.
Kaddir?

37:32.942 --> 37:34.543
Kaddir, I know you
can hear me,

37:34.544 --> 37:39.144
now it took an awful lot for Claudia to come
here today and try and work this thing out.

37:39.322 --> 37:41.102
So I think she deserves
a little credit.

37:41.103 --> 37:42.103
Credit?

37:44.896 --> 37:46.927
That's the last thing
in the world she needs.

37:46.949 --> 37:48.889
The woman bleeds me dry.

37:48.890 --> 37:49.890
You want to see blood?

37:49.891 --> 37:52.761
You just let me in there, you two-bit
desert rat, I'll slash your throat.

37:52.780 --> 37:55.550
You try to come in here
and I'll sell you Bedouin.

37:55.551 --> 37:56.451
That's it.

37:56.559 --> 37:59.037
Don't you choke my cherub.
Don't choke my cherub.

37:59.038 --> 38:01.438
- Kaddir, Claudia loves you.
- I do not.

38:07.909 --> 38:10.487
Well sir, I think you can see
Hydrolux is a real comer.

38:10.496 --> 38:13.446
They're young, but they've already
got the trust of the State Department.

38:13.452 --> 38:17.049
And they've just acquired
a major contract from the Navy.

38:17.127 --> 38:20.010
I'd like to make them a cornerstone
of your new portfolio.

38:20.040 --> 38:23.428
Navy, huh?
You know, I was a swabbie once myself.

38:23.898 --> 38:25.323
No.

38:26.550 --> 38:28.107
- Excuse me, Mark?
- Yeah?

38:28.108 --> 38:30.508
- Line two's for you.
- I'll call back. Well.

38:30.534 --> 38:32.830
I really think
you ought to take this one.

38:32.831 --> 38:36.231
- She says it's an emergency.
- Oh. Excuse me.

38:38.247 --> 38:39.083
Hello?

38:40.034 --> 38:41.261
Bernice, what...?

38:42.762 --> 38:45.662
No, I don't know what time
Wheel Of Fortune is on.

38:45.944 --> 38:48.518
I left you the TV Guide,
it's right on the dresser.

38:48.541 --> 38:53.415
Yes, I realize you're in change, you stupid.
Could you at least try...?

38:54.494 --> 38:55.507
Goodbye.

38:56.655 --> 38:59.246
- Sorry.
- That was an emergency?

38:59.324 --> 39:04.398
Well, yes actually,
in some warped alternate universe.

39:15.110 --> 39:20.549
Not so fast, Missy.
It's time to shift my butt.

39:35.450 --> 39:36.650
Mark!

39:43.251 --> 39:46.951
Mark!
Jessie!

39:51.797 --> 39:55.845
Move to the right. You're blowing
my fluffy hair all over the place.

39:57.358 --> 39:59.977
Look! A puss, my pussy.

40:00.128 --> 40:03.138
It's so majestic,
Oh, I've got to have it.

40:04.039 --> 40:09.039
And an iced tea. With lemon.
In a nice glass.

40:09.456 --> 40:11.195
Somewhere.

40:14.535 --> 40:17.431
Jiggle the handle.

40:18.023 --> 40:20.736
- How do you handle stress?
- I take a fistful of valium.

40:21.397 --> 40:25.084
I get drunk.
Real drunk.

40:25.519 --> 40:26.998
Polka.

40:27.567 --> 40:30.172
Bust somebody.
Anybody.

40:30.673 --> 40:31.932
Pump iron.

40:32.692 --> 40:34.337
Meditation.

40:35.038 --> 40:36.042
Sex.

40:37.112 --> 40:38.040
Excuse me, sir...

40:38.052 --> 40:40.391
Wait a second, this guy can't
come in here with his camera.

40:40.513 --> 40:43.856
No, we're from Channel 12 News
and we're doing a survey.

40:43.918 --> 40:45.633
How do you handle stress?

40:45.945 --> 40:51.001
Well, usually I find the source
of the stress and break his legs.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.424
How much does...

40:55.089 --> 40:56.741
How much does something like that cost?

40:56.981 --> 41:00.211
I don't know. It all depends on
how much stress is involved I guess.

41:00.312 --> 41:02.012
Usually about $200.

41:02.420 --> 41:04.216
What could you get for say 100?

41:04.394 --> 41:06.264
100? I don't know.
A kneecap or something.

41:06.265 --> 41:08.265
I don't know.
200 is usually the rate though.

41:08.352 --> 41:10.239
Okay but what if that was your budget,
what could you get?

41:10.586 --> 41:13.470
Well look if you're having money problems,
we can work something out.

41:13.521 --> 41:15.909
You can maybe do something like this,
you know I'm also a producer

41:15.931 --> 41:18.579
and I work on some
independent films.

41:18.580 --> 41:20.080
No, I couldn't do anything like that.

41:20.201 --> 41:21.554
- No I think you could.
- No really.

41:21.555 --> 41:24.355
You're on TV, you got a good look.
This could be a beautiful thing.

41:24.375 --> 41:26.032
No, I'm fine thanks,
and just, okay, thanks.

41:26.033 --> 41:28.333
Well let me know,
you know where to find me.

41:28.571 --> 41:29.659
Cut that last part.

41:36.664 --> 41:37.581
Come in.

41:39.426 --> 41:40.525
What is that?

41:40.695 --> 41:41.486
Strategy.

41:41.487 --> 41:44.987
There are plenty of old acquaintances
just dying to sweep me off my feet.

41:45.009 --> 41:46.869
Ranked in financial order?

41:46.996 --> 41:48.932
This is no time
to beat around the bush.

41:49.127 --> 41:50.948
What is that asterisk?

41:51.445 --> 41:52.835
Over 80.

41:53.402 --> 41:56.242
Claudia, don't you think that you could
give Kaddir another chance?

41:56.315 --> 41:57.976
He tried to crush me
with his automatic gate.

41:57.977 --> 42:00.077
I think he made his feelings
quite clear.

42:03.046 --> 42:05.747
Oh, no.
No.

42:06.316 --> 42:08.664
- Jonathan.
- Hi, Mom.

42:09.708 --> 42:11.065
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Jess.

42:11.066 --> 42:13.066
Is Kaddir ready to apologize?

42:13.143 --> 42:15.721
- No, he threw me out.
- Damn.

42:16.274 --> 42:19.031
Anyway...
Uncle Mark?

42:19.697 --> 42:21.814
I need a place to crash.

42:22.249 --> 42:26.328
- Jonathan, this is not a good time.
- Of course you can stay here, darling.

42:26.449 --> 42:29.667
Thanks, thanks.
Oh, Uncle Mark...

42:30.145 --> 42:34.503
- Yes, Jonathan?
- I think I just ran over your cat.

42:41.887 --> 42:47.057
Dear God, here lies the body
of Scruffy Bannister.

42:47.366 --> 42:50.057
And this time,
it's for real.

42:50.775 --> 42:55.841
In your infinite wisdom, you saw fit
to give him back to me once.

42:55.993 --> 42:59.954
But now you've ripped him
from my busom once again.

43:02.224 --> 43:03.599
What are you guys doing?

43:04.103 --> 43:06.812
- Cat funeral.
- Wait a minute. Can I have him?

43:07.046 --> 43:09.538
- No.
- What would you do with a dead cat?

43:09.547 --> 43:12.117
I'll keep him in the freezer
until school starts.

43:12.125 --> 43:14.226
You disgusting little ghoul.

43:14.256 --> 43:15.978
Who are you?
It's mother?

43:16.979 --> 43:18.279
Now be good to him.

43:18.775 --> 43:24.771
And get me out of this little piece
of hell on earth you call California.

43:25.327 --> 43:26.327
Amen.

43:44.130 --> 43:47.265
I'll kill you again,
kitty-litter breath.

43:48.244 --> 43:50.513
Jerome, I understand.

43:50.635 --> 43:54.658
Some other time then.
Right. Bye.

43:55.245 --> 43:58.758
- You pathetic worm.
- Not going so well, huh?

43:59.071 --> 44:04.202
Married. Turned gay. Married.
In jail... malpractice. Dead.

44:04.207 --> 44:06.603
I'll tell you, marriage material
is getting tough to find.

44:06.637 --> 44:07.513
Claudia.

44:08.214 --> 44:13.514
What would you say to a nice,
handsome, divorced car dealer?

44:13.756 --> 44:15.621
Foreign or domestic?

44:19.179 --> 44:20.509
Jessa, I know what you're up to.

44:20.510 --> 44:23.210
You think you can just force me off
on some total stranger,

44:23.211 --> 44:24.811
but I'm telling you, if I don't like...

44:26.149 --> 44:27.519
Is that his?

44:29.597 --> 44:30.897
Lead on.

44:38.790 --> 44:44.438
- Here she is.
- Growl. Hello.

44:44.904 --> 44:48.722
So, Jess tells me you and your boy
need a place to stay.

44:53.561 --> 44:54.497
That's right.

44:54.909 --> 44:56.309
Be my guest.

45:03.615 --> 45:06.202
I can't believe it Mark,
they were like two sex magnets,

45:06.214 --> 45:08.509
just straining
not to slam into each other.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.342
Oh yeah?
I know the feeling.

45:11.695 --> 45:13.330
Let's make love, Jess,
we'll start right here,

45:13.331 --> 45:16.031
work across the lawn and then
we wind up in the begonias.

45:18.326 --> 45:20.091
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What about Bernice?

45:20.126 --> 45:22.727
I threw some raw meat in earlier,
she'll be fine for a while.

45:28.593 --> 45:32.353
I can't believe you're old enough
to be Jonathan's mom.

45:32.374 --> 45:33.254
I'm not.

45:44.678 --> 45:46.300
Is something burning?

45:56.536 --> 45:58.575
Dad, can we get some marshmallows?

45:58.654 --> 45:59.653
Shut up!

45:59.702 --> 46:03.723
I cannot believe it.
Sixteen pair of Italian pumps incinerated.

46:04.615 --> 46:06.624
C.K. did you get those fireworks
out of there?

46:06.825 --> 46:07.725
Yeah.

46:10.303 --> 46:13.434
Well...
most of them.

46:16.395 --> 46:19.091
My tools. My tools.

46:19.094 --> 46:20.897
Your tools? My shoes.

46:20.998 --> 46:24.183
Back off, Gold Card,
I just lost my goddamn house.

46:24.184 --> 46:26.393
Well I don't understand
what the big fuss is all about.

46:26.394 --> 46:28.094
Even a cretin like you
must have insurance.

46:28.170 --> 46:31.359
Insurance? Oh, I got insurance all right.
It ought to kick in in about three months.

46:31.471 --> 46:32.733
What do I do with my kids
in the meantime?

46:32.823 --> 46:35.224
Take them to the Bel-Air hotel,
I mean anyone who owns a Lotus...

46:35.259 --> 46:39.202
Who says I own it?
It's a perk I get for trying to sell them.

46:39.429 --> 46:43.899
So, Bannister.
What are we going to do about this?

46:53.270 --> 46:55.531
Make sure Fangster stays in his box.

46:55.532 --> 46:57.032
Waste of a good belt.

47:00.276 --> 47:01.584
Jonathan, put down that stuff

47:01.596 --> 47:03.076
- and get me a scotch.
- and get me a scotch.

47:03.088 --> 47:04.959
Oh, just make yourself
comfortable, son.

47:06.068 --> 47:09.790
Brenda, you won't believe it.
Our house burned down.

47:09.885 --> 47:14.055
- These are all I could find.
- Fine, Jonathan, just...

47:14.929 --> 47:16.402
Mark, we don't have to do this.

47:16.414 --> 47:20.526
Yes, we do darling, if we want to
avoid a lawsuit for arson.

47:22.795 --> 47:23.978
Does this fold out?

47:40.450 --> 47:43.690
Hey, Mr. Bannister.
Guess what didn't burn up.

47:46.669 --> 47:49.722
I'm calling about the room for rent
for $300 a month.

47:50.278 --> 47:53.435
It is? Terrific.
Immediately?

47:54.235 --> 47:57.536
Uh... seven people?

47:57.757 --> 47:59.841
Uh huh, that's great, Phil.
Listen, by the way,

47:59.842 --> 48:02.042
what's happening with
your guest house out back?

48:02.801 --> 48:06.159
Uh huh.
How long is she expected to live?

48:07.237 --> 48:08.890
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

48:11.629 --> 48:13.381
You hang up first.

48:14.108 --> 48:17.247
No, you.
Brenda.

48:17.778 --> 48:19.495
I can hear you breathing.

48:19.517 --> 48:22.078
Jonathan, did your grandmother send you
a birthday check?

48:22.109 --> 48:23.643
Grandma's dead, mom.

48:23.744 --> 48:26.844
No, Brenda, you hang up first.

48:26.845 --> 48:29.845
No you.
Brenda.

48:29.893 --> 48:32.245
Hey, did they get another cat?

48:32.632 --> 48:33.937
No, it's the same one.

48:34.849 --> 48:37.424
They buried him alive.
Cool.

48:37.445 --> 48:39.442
Don't you be getting any ideas.

48:39.676 --> 48:44.499
- But if they can bury him, I can too.
- Well, you get permission first.

48:45.399 --> 48:46.517
- No.
- No.

48:46.551 --> 48:49.721
Don't worry about me having dinner.

48:49.733 --> 48:54.570
I'll just lick the crumbs
off my filthy sheets.

49:35.815 --> 49:37.558
- Jessie!
- What is it?

49:37.659 --> 49:40.059
- Don't look in there.
- What do they want?

49:40.250 --> 49:45.029
- They want... to stay here.
- Why, Mark, why?

49:45.081 --> 49:48.539
I don't know. Maybe we're in
some vacation guide for the damned.

49:53.834 --> 49:56.496
Oh God! Oh God!

50:00.623 --> 50:02.349
- Oh, Mark!
- Jessie!

50:03.350 --> 50:06.250
- Go to a hotel!
- Jessie, get out of here!

50:07.616 --> 50:09.454
I don't trust you people!

50:10.107 --> 50:13.072
Get out of my house!

50:15.474 --> 50:16.774
Jess, run.

50:17.175 --> 50:18.175
Leave her...

50:20.376 --> 50:21.676
Leave her alone.

50:21.995 --> 50:23.578
Jess, leave Jess...

50:33.431 --> 50:34.731
Take Bernice.

50:43.472 --> 50:47.559
Mark.
Honey, I know you're frustrated.

50:49.039 --> 50:52.117
Oh God, honey,
I'm not in the mood.

50:52.118 --> 50:53.718
- Just...
- What?

50:53.783 --> 50:57.691
Jessie?
I'm way over here. What?

51:14.316 --> 51:16.638
Have you guys seen Fangster?

52:02.318 --> 52:04.640
- Mark?
- What?

52:04.641 --> 52:08.541
We have to do something
about these people.

52:13.289 --> 52:14.877
Yes.
Uh huh.

52:15.078 --> 52:19.978
Well, I have only one question: do they all
have to pass out flowers at the airport?

52:20.779 --> 52:23.079
Uh huh.
And shave their heads.

52:24.377 --> 52:25.395
Thank you.

52:30.361 --> 52:32.681
- Hi.
- Jonathan, what are you doing here?

52:33.083 --> 52:36.905
Look, Uncle Mark,
I've been watching you.

52:37.118 --> 52:39.141
Having to take care of all of us.

52:39.293 --> 52:42.189
And, so, I'm job hunting.

52:42.711 --> 52:47.277
And I though, you know, maybe...
Well I was wondering if...

52:49.730 --> 52:55.056
You mean something here?
I do not think so, Jonathan.

52:55.278 --> 52:59.578
Well that's cool. I just...
wanted to get my own place.

53:00.327 --> 53:01.970
I'll call personell.

53:02.035 --> 53:05.610
Well, no special treatment or anything.
I mean, I'll start anywhere.

53:05.975 --> 53:08.032
The mail room would be great.

53:08.184 --> 53:11.523
In here. Frank.
This is my nephew Jonathan.

53:11.758 --> 53:13.639
Now listen, I want you
to take good care of him, okay?

53:14.107 --> 53:15.324
Welcome aboard, Jonathan.

53:15.402 --> 53:19.225
Hey, wow. Great stamps.
I got a collection.

53:19.303 --> 53:22.163
Good. So listen, if you need anything,
you call me, all right?

53:22.238 --> 53:25.825
You know, my mom was wrong.
You're not an asshole.

53:26.431 --> 53:28.986
I'll be out of your hair
in no time, Uncle Mark.

53:30.978 --> 53:35.375
Hi. Bernice, hi.
Yes, how are you? Good.

53:35.386 --> 53:38.115
Yeah, I want the Wings Of The Night
it's beautiful.

53:38.450 --> 53:40.763
Oh my God, yeah,
I have nails that go just with it.

53:40.764 --> 53:44.364
Oh, I lost mine. Listen...
Yeah, send it COD.

53:44.507 --> 53:48.112
Oh yeah. Two-two for me.
Okay. Bye, bye, hon.

53:48.986 --> 53:51.286
Jessa, what pumps do I wear with this?

53:51.894 --> 53:54.414
No, that's pee for Dr. Penix' test.

53:54.581 --> 53:56.938
He's got to check
the ovum count or something.

53:56.973 --> 53:59.939
You want me to mail
urine to New Jersey?

53:59.983 --> 54:01.296
Yeah, would you?

54:03.249 --> 54:04.171
Wait, wait...

54:04.205 --> 54:05.826
I need your opinion
on something here.

54:05.827 --> 54:08.027
These are my favorite names
for the baby so far.

54:08.218 --> 54:13.332
Amaretta, Anziv, Caramel or Treblinka.

54:13.420 --> 54:16.694
You yokel. Naming a baby
after a German concentration camp?

54:16.972 --> 54:19.672
I thought of Treblinka was one
of those cute little fairies in Cinderella.

54:19.681 --> 54:20.495
You moron.

54:20.496 --> 54:24.096
Well, I hope my water breaks
all over your fur coat.

54:46.402 --> 54:47.376
Are you okay?

54:49.672 --> 54:54.060
- Remember when that used to be our room?
- Yes, I know. In the days before time.

54:55.261 --> 54:56.161
Baby.

54:56.934 --> 54:58.087
I hate those people.

54:58.099 --> 55:01.496
Jonathan got a job.
It's going to get better. I promise.

55:11.340 --> 55:17.037
Right now, just you and me,
all alone, right here, in the closet.

55:21.716 --> 55:22.516
There.

55:23.647 --> 55:26.025
I don't think he'll be
coming back this time.

55:27.621 --> 55:30.265
Let me ask you a question.
What does the C.K. stand for anyway?

55:30.474 --> 55:31.952
Confirmed Kills.

55:32.387 --> 55:35.657
But I might change it to cat killer.
What do you think?

55:36.261 --> 55:38.427
I think we have a little problem here.

55:38.741 --> 55:39.680
C.K...

55:40.581 --> 55:42.581
do you know what happens when
you cram too many laboratory rats

55:42.582 --> 55:44.081
together in the same cage?

55:44.432 --> 55:47.213
- Yeah, they turn into fags.
- Right, some of them do.

55:47.242 --> 55:50.138
Others just turn into cannibals,
they tear each other apart.

55:50.203 --> 55:52.342
Now when you minimize that space
by blowing rooms apart,

55:52.343 --> 55:54.343
it really aggravates
the situation.

55:54.742 --> 55:57.521
It's just so boring here.

55:57.556 --> 56:00.148
Now you listen to me,
you psychotic little shit.

56:00.249 --> 56:03.649
You either get your act together, or
you're going to be a face on a milk carton.

56:03.739 --> 56:06.860
- You got it?
- You touch me, I sue you.

56:06.888 --> 56:08.897
I got a lawyer on retainer.

56:16.567 --> 56:17.567
Hi, hi.

56:17.864 --> 56:18.790
Hi honey.

56:18.791 --> 56:22.291
Do you hear that noise outside?
That is C.K. mowing the lawn.

56:22.311 --> 56:26.012
All that kid needed was a little discipline,
a little positive motivation.

56:26.978 --> 56:28.766
We can take control
of this situation, darling.

56:28.778 --> 56:30.938
We can be the captains
of our own destiny.

56:31.352 --> 56:35.251
Yes, things are looking up. I think
that this is going to work out just fine.

56:35.263 --> 56:36.218
Don't you, hon?

56:40.518 --> 56:42.019
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:46.137 --> 56:48.837
- Shoot them.
- Strangle them.

56:48.838 --> 56:50.238
Cook them in the oven.

56:50.254 --> 56:52.247
- Hide his medication.
- What?

56:52.348 --> 56:54.048
Kindness.

56:56.099 --> 56:58.886
We're talking about someone with
a clean bill of health, right?

56:58.887 --> 57:00.687
The I guess I'd use insulin.

57:00.765 --> 57:03.313
Inject 30 CCs into,
say, a freckle.

57:04.052 --> 57:06.413
Bingo, all the symptoms
of a massive coronary.

57:06.418 --> 57:09.105
A hammer.
Definitely a hammer.

57:09.127 --> 57:11.962
Oh, I don't know.
Clorox in the bean dip?

57:19.167 --> 57:20.268
Jessie, we're back.

57:22.185 --> 57:24.099
How would you murder someone?

57:24.794 --> 57:26.960
If you have a question,
Los Angeles...

57:29.168 --> 57:32.101
Ask somebody else. I mean,
I swear to God,

57:32.113 --> 57:35.187
I don't know, I don't know the answers,
I don't know anything anymore.

57:35.665 --> 57:39.061
Well, that's quite an
interesting question, Jessica.

57:39.100 --> 57:42.475
I'm sure that's crossed
everybody's mind now and then.

57:42.494 --> 57:44.606
How would you
murder someone, Karen?

57:44.715 --> 57:48.276
If you were absolutely desperate
to get rid of them, because they were

57:48.284 --> 57:51.920
- driving you out of your fucking mind.
- Whoa.

57:52.894 --> 57:54.955
Well, I'd probably...

57:56.095 --> 57:58.482
It looks like insulin's the way to go

57:58.497 --> 58:00.996
- from what that doctor said.
- Oh, yeah, right.

58:00.997 --> 58:04.897
Oh, like you can just tap-dance your way
into a drugstore and get that stuff?

58:05.135 --> 58:09.140
Please. Oh and that Clorox bit,
oh man, there is a real winner.

58:09.153 --> 58:11.967
Those people were up
all night with the runts.

58:12.068 --> 58:15.568
And they refused to jiggle the handle.

58:15.889 --> 58:17.411
What are you talking about?

58:17.889 --> 58:19.355
House guests.

58:20.637 --> 58:24.842
I am talking about
house guests from hell.

58:27.325 --> 58:29.934
Listen to me, ladies and gentlemen,
no, get that snack later,

58:29.935 --> 58:32.235
you listen to me,
lock your doors.

58:32.473 --> 58:33.800
Don't answer the phone.

58:34.001 --> 58:36.300
If you have to leave the country,
then leave the country,

58:36.301 --> 58:38.701
but don't let them in.

58:39.414 --> 58:42.550
Don't let them fool you,
they're very, very tricky.

58:42.651 --> 58:45.051
They might look like your mother or
your father or your best friend,

58:45.152 --> 58:46.452
but they're not.

58:46.501 --> 58:49.937
They're animals.
They're cockroaches.

58:50.415 --> 58:52.816
If we have a nuclear war,

58:52.817 --> 58:58.117
the only living thing
to survive will be house guests.

59:05.539 --> 59:08.575
We'll be right back.
With weather.

59:31.334 --> 59:32.334
Mark?

59:32.964 --> 59:33.964
Hello?

59:38.909 --> 59:43.505
Hey buddy! Excuse me!
Seen Mark?

59:44.731 --> 59:46.084
Have you seen Mark?

59:46.806 --> 59:48.641
Upstairs, I think.

59:50.463 --> 59:54.499
Are the Bannisters doing
a little remodeling here?

59:55.129 --> 59:57.325
I guess you might say that, yes.

59:57.625 --> 01:00:00.630
I'm building a bleacher
for the TV set.

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:05.600
Sure you are. Okay.
Sure.

01:00:12.361 --> 01:00:15.427
- Thank God.
- Move, dork.

01:00:18.971 --> 01:00:22.068
You compulsive little midget.
Next time, flush.

01:00:22.642 --> 01:00:25.473
Excuse me, have you
seen Mark Bannister?

01:00:25.612 --> 01:00:27.646
Well, he was in the kitchen.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.778
Mark, my chains are squeaking.
It's time for my lube job.

01:00:34.226 --> 01:00:36.700
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.101
Sure.

01:00:41.718 --> 01:00:45.892
Come on, Scruffy,
let's go visit Mr. Microwave.

01:00:47.149 --> 01:00:49.480
I'm going to make you
a cat soufflÃ©.

01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:50.481
Come on.

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:56.198
Excuse me, son?
Have you seen Mark Bannister?

01:00:56.251 --> 01:01:00.391
Backyard. Shit, look at what
you made me do.

01:01:00.792 --> 01:01:03.192
Sorry. Sorry.

01:01:12.266 --> 01:01:13.166
Jessie?

01:01:17.114 --> 01:01:19.836
God, Wes,
you're not moving in too are you?

01:01:19.902 --> 01:01:21.311
What?
No.

01:01:21.612 --> 01:01:23.012
Mark didn't come in
to work though,

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.513
and your phone's been
off the hook all morning,

01:01:25.514 --> 01:01:26.813
and I just thought I'd...

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.320
Mark, what the hell's going on here?

01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:31.778
Hello Wes.
I didn't sleep too good last night.

01:01:31.779 --> 01:01:32.679
At four o'clock in the morning

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.880
I think the sprinklers went off
and woke me up.

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:37.665
I believe I've got a short in one
of these extension cords too.

01:01:37.687 --> 01:01:40.671
No, no, no, no. I mean this.
I mean them.

01:01:40.772 --> 01:01:42.072
Why don't you get rid of them?

01:01:42.773 --> 01:01:45.573
- Oh no.
- Well if you don't, I will.

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:48.905
- No! We've tried that.
- It just makes more.

01:01:48.928 --> 01:01:52.341
We just hand over our paychecks,
stay out of their way.

01:01:53.637 --> 01:01:55.267
It's for the best.

01:01:55.303 --> 01:01:58.056
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
You've got to listen to me, pal.

01:01:58.057 --> 01:02:01.157
If you don't get to work soon,
you're not going to have a paycheck.

01:02:01.165 --> 01:02:04.273
Hey, come on, big guy.
Come back to me. Okay? Mark.

01:02:04.308 --> 01:02:08.083
Hydrolux down 32 points.

01:02:08.217 --> 01:02:11.374
Grindle has gone completely apeshit.
We got to go.

01:02:11.409 --> 01:02:12.854
- What should I do?
- We got to go to work.

01:02:12.855 --> 01:02:13.755
- To work?
- Chop, chop.

01:02:13.756 --> 01:02:14.556
- We should go to work.
- Go to work.

01:02:14.563 --> 01:02:15.500
I got to go to work, Jessie.

01:02:15.502 --> 01:02:16.836
- OK, hon.
- Bye, Jessie.

01:02:17.137 --> 01:02:19.337
Bye.
Don't be late for dinner, honey.

01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:24.750
- OK I won't. What are we having?
- Just squab again.

01:02:26.863 --> 01:02:30.229
- What happened here?
- Well, you know...

01:02:31.847 --> 01:02:35.403
Crackpot's file indictments
for lawsuits every day, sir.

01:02:35.586 --> 01:02:39.796
Well, even the Navy can make a mistake.
No, I didn't know that.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:43.678
I guess I missed the
Wall Street Journal all last week.

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.651
No, don't worry. I'm sorry.
Yes sir.

01:02:45.652 --> 01:02:48.245
Your Hydrolux stock
will be sold immediately. Yes, sir.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.936
- Bannister?
- Yes.

01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:52.337
I hope you have
a good explanation.

01:02:52.341 --> 01:02:54.598
The Grindle situation
is under control.

01:02:54.676 --> 01:02:56.563
- That is not what I'm talking about.
- What?

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:57.464
This.

01:02:57.554 --> 01:03:01.430
Almost $6000 worth of calls to
South America. From your office.

01:03:02.281 --> 01:03:05.182
What? Obviously it's a mistake.
I've never made any of these.

01:03:05.203 --> 01:03:08.063
- Oh. Who did?
- How the hell do I...?

01:03:08.943 --> 01:03:11.974
- I will find out.
- You do that.

01:03:16.518 --> 01:03:18.505
Jonathan, do you know anything
about phone...

01:03:19.131 --> 01:03:21.229
Hey, Mr. Bannister,
you got another one of these packages.

01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:22.041
What packages?

01:03:22.159 --> 01:03:24.713
Well, these.
Well didn't you get them?

01:03:24.825 --> 01:03:27.498
Jonathan said you'd take care of it.
I got to go. See you.

01:03:59.398 --> 01:04:01.534
Bannister.
What the hell are you doing?

01:04:02.535 --> 01:04:03.435
Sorry.

01:04:19.697 --> 01:04:21.006
- Mark.
- Come on.

01:04:21.007 --> 01:04:23.607
- Can't you see that I'm not in?
- But, but, but...

01:04:38.278 --> 01:04:39.652
Tiny, no!

01:04:40.405 --> 01:04:41.213
Fred?

01:04:41.814 --> 01:04:43.714
It's all right. Steady.
Steady, all right.

01:04:43.715 --> 01:04:44.615
What the hell is going on?

01:04:44.705 --> 01:04:48.048
I did it Pudge. Stretch.
I did it like you said.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.033
Listen, Fred,
I'll be right back.

01:04:49.045 --> 01:04:52.841
Mark!
Meet Tiny Bannister.

01:04:54.863 --> 01:04:58.277
- Fred, this is not a good time.
- Mark. I've followed my heart.

01:04:58.298 --> 01:05:01.186
- I found the real me.
- What? You joined the circus?

01:05:01.251 --> 01:05:04.151
No, I traveled.
I met interesting people.

01:05:04.252 --> 01:05:05.352
Well strangers, mostly.

01:05:05.353 --> 01:05:08.153
Wait. Let me get rid of this box
and then we'll have...

01:05:09.934 --> 01:05:11.061
Oh God.

01:05:18.622 --> 01:05:22.315
- Howdy.
- Are you the owner of this animal, sir?

01:05:22.346 --> 01:05:24.314
What?
Oh, no.

01:05:24.437 --> 01:05:26.858
- She's mine, officers.
- Do you have a permit?

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:29.063
No, not yet.
We just got into town.

01:05:29.228 --> 01:05:31.764
- Is this your residence?
- No.

01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:36.038
But my wife's upstairs,
they got her strung up in there.

01:05:36.067 --> 01:05:37.059
What?

01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:40.734
She's all right and everything.
She just tried to stab me.

01:05:40.735 --> 01:05:41.435
No.

01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:44.331
Excuse me.

01:05:48.696 --> 01:05:52.432
- Jonathan? Jonathan?
- Hey, Mark, did you see the elephant?

01:05:52.436 --> 01:05:56.328
- He's got diarrhea.
- You are diarrhea.

01:05:57.037 --> 01:05:58.998
No, Tiny, not the flower bed.

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:01.011
How do we radio this in?

01:06:26.267 --> 01:06:28.510
I'll tell you how we radio it in.

01:06:30.302 --> 01:06:31.841
Rock house.

01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:37.682
- Hey, Mark.
- What is this?

01:06:38.177 --> 01:06:42.226
It's got your name on it.
Guess it's your cocaine, man.

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:47.292
Baker 63, possible rock house.
Repeat, rock house.

01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:50.293
Elephant on premises,
send backup.

01:07:17.095 --> 01:07:19.795
Hey, Mark,
What's 1051 in Roman?

01:07:20.596 --> 01:07:22.496
Get off the bed.
What are you doing?

01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:28.772
This is the police.
Come out with your hands up.

01:07:28.873 --> 01:07:30.473
We have you surrounded.

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:46.605
Bastards want to play hardball, huh?
Call in the battering ram.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.014
To hell with this.
Get...

01:08:12.152 --> 01:08:14.948
Hey, Claude,
what the hell's going on out there?

01:08:14.968 --> 01:08:17.779
- Men. Lots of men.
- What the men?

01:08:18.091 --> 01:08:20.131
The police.
They're arresting your husband.

01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:25.654
That's a good girl, Tiny. Now steady.
Now we're going to head back to the garage.

01:08:26.162 --> 01:08:29.622
All right now.
Real slow to the squad car.

01:08:30.345 --> 01:08:32.002
Get your hands up.

01:08:37.629 --> 01:08:41.138
Hey! Hey you! Buddy!
What the hell are you going out there?

01:08:41.187 --> 01:08:43.765
Get off my new driveway.
I just put that in.

01:08:43.809 --> 01:08:48.135
Those pebbles are worth $600.
$600!

01:08:49.153 --> 01:08:52.787
$600.000.
You old fart.

01:09:15.843 --> 01:09:18.265
- Russell, please.
- I can't.

01:09:18.277 --> 01:09:20.983
Please let me go on.
I swear to God, I'm better now,

01:09:21.005 --> 01:09:25.322
and I will never ever let my home life
affect my professional life again. Ever.

01:09:25.462 --> 01:09:26.462
Please?

01:09:28.270 --> 01:09:31.741
This is my ass, Jessie.
Get in.

01:09:31.742 --> 01:09:32.542
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:33.843
Ten seconds.

01:09:37.944 --> 01:09:40.243
This is the channel 12
eight o'clock report.

01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:42.045
- With your...
- Camera one, tape in five,

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:47.246
- four, three, two.
- ... question girl, Jessica Bannister.

01:09:47.381 --> 01:09:49.795
Good evening.
Our top story tonight:

01:09:49.807 --> 01:09:53.162
A SWAT team strike has been called in
on a Santa Monica home.

01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:57.188
We now go live to
field reporter Brad Bovie. Brad?

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.637
That's right, Karen.
Details are still a little sketchy,

01:09:59.638 --> 01:10:02.838
but apparently police suspecting
cocaine on the premises

01:10:02.839 --> 01:10:04.439
have called in a full strike.

01:10:04.589 --> 01:10:09.273
What we've heard is that they have
reason to believe that this is a rock house.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:13.274
Holy shit!

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.317
Wait a minute,
someone's coming out.

01:10:22.765 --> 01:10:26.458
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. That was cool.

01:10:26.566 --> 01:10:29.515
Are we on TV?
Brenda, call me.

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:31.737
- Sir, are you the homeowner?
- No.

01:10:32.346 --> 01:10:35.502
- Did you say he was dealing drugs?
- Well we don't...

01:10:35.503 --> 01:10:37.603
I never did trust that guy.

01:10:37.668 --> 01:10:39.776
It's them quiet,
wimpy types

01:10:39.777 --> 01:10:42.277
who always get involved
in this sort of thing, ain't it?

01:10:42.382 --> 01:10:44.695
Flipping out, raping, killing...

01:10:44.739 --> 01:10:47.343
Karen, back to you until we can
make some kind of sense out of this.

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:50.504
Tiny please, come on,
this is not your mama.

01:10:53.026 --> 01:10:56.476
Thanks, Brad.
We understand that the homeowners

01:10:56.477 --> 01:10:58.377
are being sought
for questioning.

01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:03.232
And that that baby elephant that you
just saw, is apparently unlicensed,

01:11:03.254 --> 01:11:05.686
and will be taken
into police custody.

01:11:05.687 --> 01:11:10.287
We'll keep you updated
as this bizarre story unfolds.

01:11:17.608 --> 01:11:19.786
More poisonous gases.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.719
Investigators at this hour
are still trying to determine

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.420
the source of poisonous gases
which rendered twelve employees

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:30.997
of the Midwilshire District
businesses unconscious.

01:11:55.466 --> 01:11:56.483
Jessie.

01:11:57.375 --> 01:12:00.255
- Thank God, I found you.
- Mark, what happened?

01:12:00.257 --> 01:12:04.020
Our nephew is a drug czar and
now I'm David Jansen.

01:12:04.176 --> 01:12:06.620
- I have this whole...
- The Dow Jones plummeted again today.

01:12:06.621 --> 01:12:09.921
Among the hardest hit
was the Hydrolux Corporation,

01:12:09.998 --> 01:12:13.395
which amid allegations of fraud
by the US Navy,

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:16.196
fell a record 85 points.

01:12:16.316 --> 01:12:19.778
Hydrolux president,
Robert Nellins was unavailable for comment,

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:24.214
Channel 12 News has learned however
he's on vacation in Bora-Bora.

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:28.536
Great. I'm an unemployed David Jansen,
I forgot to sell Grindle's stock.

01:12:28.614 --> 01:12:32.406
- Shit, shit, shit. Come on.
- No. I don't want to go.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.524
No, I'm staying here. You're not
going to get me out of here, Mark.

01:12:34.525 --> 01:12:36.425
- Honey.
- Let's live here.

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:37.594
What?

01:12:37.695 --> 01:12:40.695
Look, it's beautiful, everything's clean
and nice and...

01:12:40.872 --> 01:12:45.530
Oh, Mark, there's food in the...
Oh, look, Mark, mock-chicken pot pie.

01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:47.591
- Come on Jessie, let's go.
- No. No.

01:12:47.592 --> 01:12:49.792
You're not going to take me away.
I'm not letting go of the...

01:12:49.993 --> 01:12:52.493
Jessie!
Jessie. Jessie.

01:12:53.061 --> 01:12:56.810
Listen to me, Mark. We can
live in one of the soap opera sets.

01:12:56.987 --> 01:13:00.336
They'll never know we're here, Mark.
We can be the phantoms of Channel 12.

01:13:00.371 --> 01:13:02.371
Listen to me,
everything is going to be...

01:13:02.372 --> 01:13:05.072
Don't you say everything's
going to be all right.

01:13:05.728 --> 01:13:10.089
It's not going to be all right.
Ever! Ever!

01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:14.324
Honey, honey, listen, listen,
all right fine. Listen.

01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:19.856
We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow we're leaving town.

01:13:19.935 --> 01:13:20.787
Changing our name.

01:13:20.788 --> 01:13:22.888
- We're going to start all over.
- What about our house?

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:26.187
Forget the house, I don't give a damn
about the house, let them repossess it.

01:13:26.544 --> 01:13:29.914
I don't care about our jobs,
I don't care about any of our stuff.

01:13:30.671 --> 01:13:33.769
The only thing that matters...

01:13:33.971 --> 01:13:38.590
...really matters...
is us.

01:13:40.691 --> 01:13:42.591
Oh, honey.

01:14:13.594 --> 01:14:15.616
Yeah. I know what you mean.

01:14:15.812 --> 01:14:18.729
Oh, come on. Let's just grab what we can
and get out of here, okay?

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.979
Yes, this is Dr. Penix,
calling from Trenton.

01:14:24.091 --> 01:14:25.907
Bernice I've been trying
to reach you for weeks,

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:27.479
but this line's always busy.

01:14:27.552 --> 01:14:31.866
I've got your test results here.
I don't know how to tell you this, but...

01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:37.884
You're not pregnant.

01:14:38.637 --> 01:14:39.437
What?

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:45.240
Dr. Penix just called and he said
there is absolutely no way in the world

01:14:45.451 --> 01:14:47.029
that you are pregnant.

01:14:47.529 --> 01:14:49.610
You must have sent
the wrong pee.

01:14:50.608 --> 01:14:54.491
Look at that, Bernice,
your stomach is flat as a board.

01:14:55.383 --> 01:14:57.087
I got a thin fetus.

01:14:57.601 --> 01:15:01.306
Bernice, get over it
and get out.

01:15:02.036 --> 01:15:06.302
You're just jealous because no sperm
in it's right mind

01:15:06.303 --> 01:15:09.003
would swim
up your shriveled canal.

01:15:12.004 --> 01:15:15.004
Let go of me!
Hey, hey!

01:15:35.258 --> 01:15:38.735
- Stay away from me, crazy lady.
- Say it.

01:15:38.836 --> 01:15:39.836
What?

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:41.907
I want to hear you say it.

01:15:42.885 --> 01:15:43.825
I guess...

01:15:44.532 --> 01:15:45.864
I'm not pregnant.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.585
But, you know, I could have sworn...
I felt my breasts swelling, constipation...

01:15:49.986 --> 01:15:52.216
- Say it!
- Somebody help.

01:15:52.539 --> 01:15:54.809
Aren't you going to do something?

01:15:54.839 --> 01:15:56.792
- No.
- No.

01:15:56.827 --> 01:15:58.735
I'm going to count to three, Bernice.

01:15:58.845 --> 01:16:01.531
- One.
- I want a second opinion.

01:16:01.532 --> 01:16:02.732
Two.

01:16:04.649 --> 01:16:07.137
- Say it.
- All right, we're leaving.

01:16:07.219 --> 01:16:09.802
Fred, start packing.

01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:21.825
Honey, it's over, it's finally over.

01:16:24.652 --> 01:16:25.539
Not quite.

01:16:31.905 --> 01:16:33.579
Let's clean house.

01:16:33.728 --> 01:16:36.437
Yeah.
Kick ass.

01:16:55.921 --> 01:16:58.757
- Company!
- Company!

01:17:08.106 --> 01:17:10.067
Oh, sis!

01:17:10.776 --> 01:17:14.802
Sister's got a surprise for you!

01:17:14.924 --> 01:17:18.760
Oh, you want to play?
Let's go, Bannister.

01:17:20.447 --> 01:17:21.982
Now let's play Cuisinart.

01:17:28.174 --> 01:17:29.779
Oh, Claudia.

01:17:31.161 --> 01:17:32.448
I'm not decent.

01:17:34.353 --> 01:17:36.318
Tell me something I don't know.

01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:38.823
Now Jessie, calm down,
I'll get you a valium.

01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:43.472
- You think you're real sharp, don't you?
- People are like going totally mental.

01:17:45.855 --> 01:17:47.489
Let me ask you a question!

01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:52.104
- Are you circumcised?
- I'm warning you.

01:17:52.843 --> 01:17:55.073
Stop, they're Charles Jourdan!

01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:58.101
Now, I want you
to get your gold-digging,

01:17:58.102 --> 01:18:02.702
lilly white ass
out of my house.

01:18:03.403 --> 01:18:08.203
- Uh.
- No!

01:18:11.004 --> 01:18:14.204
You psycho. Hey, man.
Don't kill me, don't, don't.

01:18:15.505 --> 01:18:17.205
You wimp!

01:18:18.525 --> 01:18:22.247
It always figured you'd come up
short in a clinch. Come on!

01:18:29.608 --> 01:18:32.775
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

01:18:46.376 --> 01:18:49.776
Jesus, what's this?
Jesus Christ. Jonathan.

01:18:50.155 --> 01:18:52.747
- Now you get the hell out of my house!
- Back off! Back off!

01:18:52.817 --> 01:18:55.460
You try that again and I'll cut you,
I swear.

01:19:01.896 --> 01:19:03.426
- Give me your keys.
- What?

01:19:03.427 --> 01:19:06.127
Give me your car keys now!
Shut up!

01:19:06.549 --> 01:19:08.157
Wouldn't you rather
take the Lotus?

01:19:08.936 --> 01:19:09.736
Yeah.

01:19:11.028 --> 01:19:13.516
Yeah. It's an excellent idea.
Here you go... oh.

01:19:13.517 --> 01:19:15.517
I'm real sorry about that.

01:19:15.581 --> 01:19:17.564
You know what? You know what?
I think if we just rested a minute

01:19:17.565 --> 01:19:19.965
and thought about this,
we might be able to work it out.

01:19:19.981 --> 01:19:20.881
Bullshit!

01:19:20.917 --> 01:19:24.378
Now, you know, Jonathan, we're all family,
we could sit down, have a talk, maybe...

01:19:24.421 --> 01:19:27.430
- That's bullshit! Shut up!
- Let's call the prayer line.

01:19:27.587 --> 01:19:30.868
Uncle Mark.
You are a yuppie dickhead!

01:19:32.187 --> 01:19:35.531
One day, I'm going to
buy and sell people like you.

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:39.184
- I'm going to make some noise.
- We know you are.

01:19:43.085 --> 01:19:44.485
- Jonathan?
- Move!

01:19:44.919 --> 01:19:46.933
Hey, that's my fireworks!

01:19:46.934 --> 01:19:49.134
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that car!

01:19:49.163 --> 01:19:50.576
That's a loaner!

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:03.504
Stupid things didn't work.

01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:10.728
They always work.

01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:16.936
- I am the king of this castle!
- And I am his queen!

01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:22.903
And we will burn it to the ground
before we let any of you back in!

01:20:23.868 --> 01:20:26.665
You... parasites!

01:20:41.702 --> 01:20:43.154
Are you the home owners here?

01:20:43.159 --> 01:20:45.054
That's right,
what are you going to do about it?

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:46.564
Well, on behalf of the P.D.,

01:20:46.565 --> 01:20:50.065
I've been authorized to issue an official
apology for what happened last night,

01:20:50.066 --> 01:20:52.166
we're prepared to pay for the damages.

01:20:52.173 --> 01:20:54.790
- All the damages?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:20:54.825 --> 01:20:56.834
What, what about the criminal investigation?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.678
Well, yeah, there was
some talk about pursuing that.

01:20:59.869 --> 01:21:02.039
Until we found all our
hard evidence was missing.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:03.140
What hard evidence?

01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:05.042
That cat that dropped dead
on your lawn?

01:21:05.054 --> 01:21:07.095
Yeah, it disappeared
out of the evidence room.

01:21:07.148 --> 01:21:09.457
Believe me, there's going to be
hell to pay over that one.

01:21:29.613 --> 01:21:32.379
Jesus Christ, Bannister!
I've been looking all over for you!

01:21:32.382 --> 01:21:35.515
Oh yeah, Grindle?
Let me tell you something.

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:38.316
I have had it up to here
with loud-mouth bullies like you.

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:39.752
The Navy dropped their fraud charges.

01:21:39.764 --> 01:21:40.966
You want to fire me, go ahead.

01:21:40.968 --> 01:21:42.966
Hydrolux went up 157 points.

01:21:42.978 --> 01:21:43.909
Do you know
what your problem is?

01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:45.459
I made a bundle
because you hung in there.

01:21:45.460 --> 01:21:47.860
You're the worst kind
of arrogant, small-minded...

01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:49.761
- I want you to work for me.
- Buts!

01:21:49.763 --> 01:21:52.060
- I'll double your salary.
- Screw you.

01:21:52.061 --> 01:21:54.860
- All right, triple.
- Screw you blue.

01:21:54.995 --> 01:21:58.734
Senior Vice-President at four times
your present salary.

01:21:58.735 --> 01:22:00.435
That's my final offer!

01:22:00.612 --> 01:22:02.993
- If that's okay.
- Let me tell you something, asshole.

01:22:02.994 --> 01:22:05.094
Honey.
Shut up.

01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:08.509
We'll let you know.

01:22:08.515 --> 01:22:12.545
Great! Your kind of hard balls
are exactly what I've been looking for.

01:22:12.618 --> 01:22:14.454
You and me are going to make millions!

01:22:17.702 --> 01:22:19.282
I don't believe we've met.

01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:22.081
Bob Grindle, ma'am.

01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:27.325
- And you are?
- Your wildest dreams come true, darling.

01:22:29.995 --> 01:22:32.429
Well, Lotus is definitely
the car of the future.

01:22:32.484 --> 01:22:35.431
When my insurance kicks in,
I'm going to be back on easy street.

01:22:35.466 --> 01:22:38.192
But in the meantime I was wondering
if you might happen to have room

01:22:38.193 --> 01:22:41.293
at your place for me
and a couple of wonderful kids.

01:22:41.301 --> 01:22:42.301
Maybe.

01:22:42.588 --> 01:22:44.829
- Dad, I don't want to live with some cop!
- Hey!

01:22:44.963 --> 01:22:47.580
You want to eat brussel sprouts
three meals a day, punk?

01:22:53.838 --> 01:22:55.416
Yo baby, chop-chop.

01:22:55.595 --> 01:22:57.908
Don't "yo baby" me.

01:22:58.417 --> 01:23:01.091
You said you were going to change,
I thought might you change,

01:23:01.092 --> 01:23:03.592
and maybe you'd shave,
you know you look like Fu Manchu.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.709
- you could...
- Bernice. Remember what we practiced?

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:11.192
- No yupping.
- That's right.

01:23:11.414 --> 01:23:13.863
Fine, good, you can do
all the talking from now on

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:16.464
because my jaws are tired
after all these years...

01:23:23.050 --> 01:23:27.773
Scruffy-doodle! Oh, there is a God.
Come to me.

01:23:31.913 --> 01:23:32.861
Bernice,

01:23:33.848 --> 01:23:35.739
I don't think he wants to go with you.

01:23:36.457 --> 01:23:40.175
According to my calculations, he has...
five lives left.

01:23:40.414 --> 01:23:42.597
He's welcome to spend the rest
of them with us if he wants to.

01:23:42.688 --> 01:23:43.888
He's earned it.

01:23:44.241 --> 01:23:46.867
Don't be silly,
come to mama, sweetie.

01:23:49.032 --> 01:23:50.233
Traitor.

01:23:51.655 --> 01:23:53.742
We really got to stay in touch, Stretch.

01:23:56.242 --> 01:23:57.702
I'll call you once a month.

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.673
Is collect okay till I get a job?

01:24:01.982 --> 01:24:05.587
All right.
If you ever get to New Jersey...

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:07.700
We'll stay at the Holiday Inn.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.700
I cannot believe this place
is really ours again.

01:25:10.157 --> 01:25:11.375
I'll be back.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:41.001
.
