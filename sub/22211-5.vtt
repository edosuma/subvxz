00:00.398 --> 00:03.982
Time travel is real, and
so are its consequences.

00:03.984 --> 00:06.751
When a terrible time paradox
put all of history in peril,

00:06.753 --> 00:08.520
an elite team was formed.

00:08.522 --> 00:10.922
Their job... to protect
history and repair these

00:10.924 --> 00:12.591
so-called anachronisms.

00:12.593 --> 00:15.393
Unfortunately, this is
not that elite team.

00:15.395 --> 00:18.830
And yet, this team of misfits
and outcasts is determined

00:18.832 --> 00:20.999
to fix the history
which they have broken.

00:21.002 --> 00:24.954
Not because they are heroes,
but because they are legends.

00:25.437 --> 00:27.205
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:27.207 --> 00:29.474
Seeing Stein with his
grandkid earlier...

00:29.476 --> 00:31.643
You two are inseparable. Literally.

00:31.645 --> 00:33.144
I want to break up Firestorm.

00:33.146 --> 00:34.851
Your totem's strength grows

00:34.854 --> 00:38.250
when the threats that you must
face become more powerful.

00:38.252 --> 00:40.819
But you cannot face
this new threat alone.

00:40.821 --> 00:43.722
That amulet is a totem.
We're bound together somehow.

00:43.724 --> 00:46.491
Cut the crap and tell me
what we're facing here.

00:46.493 --> 00:48.293
That information is need-to-know.

00:48.295 --> 00:49.961
The only thing you need to know...

00:49.963 --> 00:52.264
Your ridiculous team
could never handle it.

00:52.266 --> 00:54.699
They are the reason Mallus is a threat.

00:54.701 --> 00:57.869
And there might just come a
day when we need the Legends

00:57.871 --> 00:59.371
to do what they do best.

01:19.259 --> 01:21.559
You best stop following me, guv.

01:27.668 --> 01:29.634
That is a most impressive scream.

01:29.636 --> 01:31.670
In another era, you could have a career

01:31.672 --> 01:32.737
alongside Vincent Price.

01:36.576 --> 01:38.410
Rigor mortis hasn't set in.

01:38.412 --> 01:40.612
He's been dead less than four hours.

01:40.614 --> 01:42.847
Extreme pallor in the
face and fingernails

01:42.849 --> 01:46.151
suggest rapid blood loss,
yet not a drop to be seen.

01:46.153 --> 01:49.087
Killed off-site, his body dumped here,

01:49.090 --> 01:50.861
far from the illustrious
streets of his upbringing.

01:50.863 --> 01:52.762
A handkerchief with his college crest...

01:52.765 --> 01:54.225
A graduation gift, no doubt.

01:57.431 --> 02:00.432
What do you make of that?

02:00.434 --> 02:03.168
Improbably, it appears that

02:03.170 --> 02:05.904
our killer is... a vampire.

02:11.078 --> 02:15.046
You sure you want to do
this? Break up Firestorm?

02:15.048 --> 02:17.082
Well, I'm sure Grey wants off the ship,

02:17.084 --> 02:18.683
but I'm sure that can't happen

02:18.685 --> 02:20.385
if we're still bonded
to each other, so...

02:20.387 --> 02:22.023
Yeah, but your bond isn't just physical.

02:22.026 --> 02:24.434
You guys have been psychically
bonded for over three years.

02:24.437 --> 02:27.058
Yeah, and it's been no
picnic, let me tell you.

02:27.060 --> 02:29.661
Last time I got laid,
afterwards Grey said to me,

02:29.663 --> 02:32.530
"Well done, Jefferson." I mean...

02:32.532 --> 02:34.332
Could have done without knowing that.

02:34.334 --> 02:36.609
Does Grey...

02:36.612 --> 02:38.112
I mean, Marty... know that

02:38.115 --> 02:39.512
you want to break up with him?

02:39.515 --> 02:41.414
No clue. But if he did,

02:41.417 --> 02:42.781
he'd say it was too dangerous.

02:42.784 --> 02:44.843
Well, if you're really
determined to do this,

02:44.845 --> 02:46.845
severing your psychic
connection could give us

02:46.847 --> 02:49.781
some much needed mental space
to figure out how to untie

02:49.783 --> 02:51.182
the nuclear knot.

02:51.184 --> 02:53.485
Well, let's do it.

02:53.487 --> 02:54.953
Here goes.

02:57.791 --> 02:59.557
Oh, I forgot.

02:59.559 --> 03:01.359
There might be a couple side effects.

03:01.361 --> 03:03.928
- What side effects?
- Um, just, like, you know,

03:03.930 --> 03:05.085
facial swelling,

03:05.088 --> 03:06.654
maybe a little gastrointestinal upset,

03:06.657 --> 03:08.298
uh, oh, and short-term memory loss.

03:08.301 --> 03:11.436
- How do you feel?
- Uh, normal.

03:11.438 --> 03:15.106
Except... I'm not craving grapefruit.

03:15.108 --> 03:17.242
Okay.

03:17.244 --> 03:20.578
Ray, it's 9:00 a.m., and
I'm not craving grapefruit!

03:22.783 --> 03:24.707
Mmm. Delightful.

03:24.710 --> 03:25.875
Let me get this straight.

03:25.878 --> 03:28.987
This ship can make any kind
of food you can imagine,

03:28.989 --> 03:32.304
and you three picked
grapefruit, a bran muffin,

03:32.307 --> 03:34.240
and oatmeal.

03:34.243 --> 03:36.994
After you try everything,
you go back to the basics.

03:36.997 --> 03:41.020
I lived my whole life eating
rations and bland food.

03:41.023 --> 03:45.370
From now on, I eat like a queen.

03:45.372 --> 03:46.971
I'm glad you left 2042.

03:46.973 --> 03:48.640
Actually, I wanted to talk to you guys

03:48.642 --> 03:50.975
about going back to 2042.

03:50.977 --> 03:54.078
Or better yet, 2041.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.481
I was thinking, "Why is my family dead

03:56.483 --> 03:58.283
when I'm on a time machine?"

03:58.285 --> 04:01.386
Unfortunately, that's
not how this works.

04:01.388 --> 04:02.854
I thought you could change the past.

04:02.856 --> 04:04.556
We can correct the past.

04:04.558 --> 04:07.292
And the future, but we don't change it.

04:07.294 --> 04:09.027
- Why not?
- Because doing so could cause

04:09.029 --> 04:11.663
unforeseen, possibly even
disastrous consequences.

04:11.665 --> 04:14.132
It's a temporal butterfly effect,

04:14.134 --> 04:15.767
- if you will.
- Try not doing something

04:15.769 --> 04:17.902
that would save your brother's life.

04:17.904 --> 04:20.546
Does a sister count?

04:22.017 --> 04:23.775
What's up, shipmates?

04:23.777 --> 04:26.010
I got exciting news to share.

04:26.012 --> 04:27.989
Team meeting in ten minutes.

04:27.992 --> 04:30.348
And, Mick, I have beer.

04:34.054 --> 04:37.155
One lousy beer for breakfast.

04:37.157 --> 04:39.008
- It's breakfast?
- Yeah.

04:39.011 --> 04:40.511
What time did you go to
bed last night, buddy?

04:40.513 --> 04:41.680
I didn't. Drank a lot of coffee.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.935
Can you tell? Whoa!

04:42.938 --> 04:44.864
Nate, why are we staring
at an anachronism map?

04:44.867 --> 04:47.197
Because, Captain, I did
a deep dive on the data.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.766
And the anachronisms we created

04:48.768 --> 04:50.802
at first glance seem
scattershot... random.

04:50.804 --> 04:52.704
But since history is cause and effect,

04:52.706 --> 04:54.272
I decided to do a little experiment.

04:54.274 --> 04:56.808
I folded a linear timeline onto itself

04:56.810 --> 04:58.710
following the mathematics
of the golden ratio.

04:58.712 --> 05:00.144
Follow me.

05:04.251 --> 05:06.054
Damn it, Gideon. That was your cue.

05:06.057 --> 05:07.890
My apologies, Dr. Heywood.

05:07.893 --> 05:10.889
Ah, see, the anachronisms
form a pattern.

05:10.891 --> 05:13.707
Should have guessed.
Though time may be broken,

05:13.710 --> 05:15.609
like all matter in the known universe,

05:15.612 --> 05:17.962
it still possesses a
mathematical harmony.

05:17.964 --> 05:21.082
Not exactly. Uh, what about those two?

05:21.085 --> 05:24.593
Those two are outliers. The
first one is Seattle, 2042.

05:24.596 --> 05:26.604
When the assassin tried to kill me.

05:26.606 --> 05:28.540
Right, while cool... Not the part where,

05:28.542 --> 05:29.941
you know, you almost got killed...

05:29.943 --> 05:31.476
It's not as cool as the other one.

05:31.478 --> 05:33.878
London, 1895.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.596
How do I say this?

05:35.599 --> 05:37.366
There's a vampire.

05:37.369 --> 05:39.867
Half dozen men snatched off the streets

05:39.870 --> 05:42.487
only to have their bodies
dumped three days later

05:42.489 --> 05:44.523
completely drained of blood.

05:44.526 --> 05:45.790
Vampires.

05:45.792 --> 05:47.260
Waited my whole life to kill one.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.027
Do you just carry that
around all the time?

05:49.029 --> 05:50.528
My whole life.

05:50.530 --> 05:52.196
There's no such thing as vampires.

05:52.198 --> 05:54.465
Increased immigration
at the fin de siècle

05:54.467 --> 05:57.437
and the fear that good English
women would lose their virtue

05:57.440 --> 06:00.071
to foreign predators is responsible

06:00.073 --> 06:01.518
for these ludicrous stories.

06:01.521 --> 06:03.341
I say we go see what's so interesting

06:03.343 --> 06:05.009
about this anachronism.

06:11.651 --> 06:16.020
Victorian London. Opium
dens and low-cut corsets.

06:16.023 --> 06:18.642
Arthur Conan Doyle and the rolling fog.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.626
Syphilis, whores, and vampires.

06:21.628 --> 06:24.295
There's a strong smell of garlic.

06:24.297 --> 06:26.130
It's tied around my neck.

06:26.132 --> 06:27.899
Yep, you're a regular Van Helsing.

06:27.901 --> 06:29.184
That's from Dracula.

06:29.187 --> 06:30.850
I'm reading it. Don't tell me the end.

06:30.853 --> 06:33.466
Another vampire victim
found dead in the street.

06:33.469 --> 06:34.501
Oy, gimme that.

06:34.504 --> 06:35.524
Whoa, vampires?

06:35.527 --> 06:37.075
What the hell is he talking about?

06:37.077 --> 06:39.746
The blood-sucking creatures
that we're here hunting.

06:39.749 --> 06:42.312
Oh, no. Short-term memory loss.

06:42.315 --> 06:43.815
One of the side effects of the serum.

06:44.985 --> 06:47.151
Shh, come on.

06:51.625 --> 06:54.492
- Who are you lot?
- Oy, Scotland Yard.

06:54.494 --> 06:57.481
We're here to see about these
so-called vampire attacks.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.097
And we're with the NYPD.

06:59.099 --> 07:00.531
Nothing like a bit of cooperation

07:00.533 --> 07:02.300
- from across the pond, right?
- Right.

07:02.302 --> 07:05.603
- This one of the victims?
- Unlucky devil.

07:06.906 --> 07:08.773
- Ooh!
- Whoa, whoa, Mick!

07:08.775 --> 07:11.109
You don't want him coming
back to life, do you?

07:11.111 --> 07:13.077
What's going on here?

07:13.079 --> 07:15.146
Scotland Yard has already visited twice,

07:15.148 --> 07:18.116
and if the NYPD is issuing
ladies warrant cards,

07:18.118 --> 07:19.984
then I'm the bloody Queen.

07:25.825 --> 07:27.859
All right, who brought their phone?

07:27.861 --> 07:30.228
Wasn't me, even though
I do love that song.

07:30.230 --> 07:32.296
That's not a phone.

07:32.298 --> 07:35.700
That's a 2016 Palmer
Tech 7G smart watch.

07:35.702 --> 07:37.135
Hand it over.

07:37.137 --> 07:38.903
I don't know what you're on about.

07:38.905 --> 07:40.423
You want some of this?

07:45.781 --> 07:48.179
Who does that watch belong to?

07:48.181 --> 07:49.847
No? All right.

07:49.849 --> 07:51.549
Mick, stake him.

07:51.551 --> 07:53.238
Oh, all right. All right.

07:53.241 --> 07:55.970
A vicar was walking down
the street as calm as can be

07:55.973 --> 07:58.455
when a dead man fell from the sky.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.425
It wasn't no normal corpse, neither.

08:00.427 --> 08:02.694
No identification, strange clothes,

08:02.696 --> 08:05.430
- and that there watch.
- Which you stole.

08:05.432 --> 08:08.433
He wasn't gonna miss it. I will, though.

08:08.435 --> 08:10.501
It is the finest
timepiece I've ever seen.

08:10.503 --> 08:13.074
It did sell better in England.

08:13.077 --> 08:14.906
So, where's our John Doe now?

08:14.908 --> 08:17.442
Well, I buried him in Stone's Hollow.

08:17.444 --> 08:20.892
And the next day, the
first vampire victim

08:20.895 --> 08:22.814
was snatched from the street.

08:22.816 --> 08:25.416
'Cause that corpse you buried
was a vampire from the future,

08:25.418 --> 08:27.418
- you idiot.
- All right, time to go.

08:30.690 --> 08:33.957
- Who are you lot?
- Tonight, we're grave diggers.

08:37.397 --> 08:39.126
Whoa.

08:39.129 --> 08:40.364
All right, we're looking for

08:40.366 --> 08:42.200
one unmarked grave among hundreds.

08:42.202 --> 08:45.236
I say we split up.
Check them row by row.

08:45.238 --> 08:49.240
Or we can start with the
one that's already dug up.

08:49.242 --> 08:51.209
Ah! Yes.

08:51.211 --> 08:54.423
Ah, the vampire must've dug
himself out before nightfall.

08:54.426 --> 08:58.282
Damn it, that anachronistic
corpse was our only lead.

09:00.787 --> 09:02.453
Wait, did you hear that?

09:12.432 --> 09:13.731
Kill it, kill it, kill it!

09:18.104 --> 09:19.771
- Rip.
- Rip?

09:19.773 --> 09:22.006
- Welcome to London.
- Listen, Englishman.

09:22.008 --> 09:23.548
Those time pigs try to take me,

09:23.551 --> 09:24.642
I'll burn 'em alive.

09:24.644 --> 09:26.043
The... the Time Bureau are not actually

09:26.045 --> 09:28.179
aware of my current whereabouts.

09:28.181 --> 09:31.645
And as surprising as this may sound...

09:31.648 --> 09:33.371
I need the Legends' help.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.764
Ms. Jiwe. I was surprised to hear

09:44.767 --> 09:47.334
- that you'd rejoined the team.
- It's surprising to me too.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.524
I trust we're not under arrest?

09:49.527 --> 09:51.772
- Far from it.
- Rip?

09:51.774 --> 09:55.141
What... Rip, where the
hell did you come from?

09:55.144 --> 09:56.377
Where'd he come from?

09:56.379 --> 09:58.579
What... where... Where
do any of us come from?

09:58.581 --> 10:01.081
You know, what are the odds
of that one lonely sperm

10:01.083 --> 10:03.083
meeting with that one special egg?

10:03.085 --> 10:05.152
You know us science types are
always still wrestling with

10:05.154 --> 10:06.480
the big questions.

10:06.483 --> 10:08.989
We've answered those
questions, Dr. Palmer.

10:08.991 --> 10:11.325
Mm-hmm. I need Jax's help,

10:11.327 --> 10:13.661
uh, with this. Um, there's some GPS data

10:13.663 --> 10:15.996
on here, and, um, it
might be able to tell us

10:15.998 --> 10:17.865
where our dead man walking came from

10:17.867 --> 10:19.967
and, uh, where he's going. Or her.

10:19.969 --> 10:21.101
So, yep.

10:23.162 --> 10:24.638
Oh, man, the short-term memory loss

10:24.640 --> 10:25.873
is worse than I anticipated.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.274
Marty's definitely gonna notice.

10:27.276 --> 10:30.344
It's okay. Uh, I got this.

10:30.346 --> 10:32.880
I'll just write myself a
note. Like, uh, Rip's back.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.715
Excuse me, what's going on?

10:34.717 --> 10:37.578
- What... nothing, man.
- You're acting awfully strange.

10:37.581 --> 10:38.719
Oh, it's, uh...

10:38.721 --> 10:40.220
Temporal dysplasia.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.855
You know... You know how that is.

10:41.857 --> 10:43.791
Mmhmm.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.959
Lily.

10:45.961 --> 10:47.628
- Dad.
- Is everything all right?

10:47.630 --> 10:49.463
Ronnie won't sleep.

10:49.465 --> 10:51.732
Your lullabies are the
only thing that work.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.701
All right. Uh, excuse me.

10:53.703 --> 10:56.470
Priorities. All right, little guy.

10:56.472 --> 10:59.606
It's time for you to go to sleep.

10:59.608 --> 11:03.492
♪ Hush, little Ronnie ♪

11:03.495 --> 11:06.080
♪ Don't say a word ♪

11:06.082 --> 11:09.083
- Come on, man.
- All right.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.542
We'll continue with the plan.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.419
But not until we figure
out whose watch this is.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.761
Which could be difficult.

11:13.764 --> 11:15.422
"Digital Digest" gave
my software encryption

11:15.424 --> 11:16.890
a five padlock rating.

11:16.892 --> 11:18.092
Huh.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.262
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.764
I... I didn't realize
that you were praying.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.165
Mecca's that way.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.968
I was just looking for my earring.

11:27.970 --> 11:30.003
I wanted to talk to you about before.

11:30.005 --> 11:31.538
I know that it's tough.

11:31.540 --> 11:32.806
That I'm not allowed to save my family?

11:32.808 --> 11:34.308
Yeah, it's real tough.

11:34.311 --> 11:36.477
You should take comfort
that your brother wanted you

11:36.479 --> 11:37.878
to have that totem.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.646
You reclaimed it.

11:39.648 --> 11:42.015
It's your birthright.
It's your family's...

11:42.017 --> 11:44.718
Hey, stop talking about my
family when you're telling me

11:44.720 --> 11:45.953
I can't save them.

11:49.692 --> 11:50.924
What the hell was that?

11:50.926 --> 11:52.183
This is the reason

11:52.186 --> 11:54.361
I asked you to stay aboard the ship.

11:54.363 --> 11:57.064
The reason that I haven't returned home.

11:57.066 --> 11:58.832
We're connected.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.468
What for?

12:01.470 --> 12:03.203
I don't know.

12:03.205 --> 12:04.538
I was hoping that

12:04.540 --> 12:06.874
we could find that answer together.

12:11.113 --> 12:13.514
Not to be...

12:13.516 --> 12:16.717
overly sentimental, but, uh,

12:16.719 --> 12:18.919
I've missed this place.

12:18.921 --> 12:20.387
We'd love to reminisce with you,

12:20.389 --> 12:22.489
but your Time Bureau's on our tail.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.458
Makes us slow to help you out.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.760
I'll get down to it, then.

12:26.762 --> 12:29.329
When I permitted the Legends
to keep the Waverider...

12:29.331 --> 12:31.465
Nobody permits us to do anything.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.267
I had an ulterior motive.

12:33.269 --> 12:35.702
Why does that not surprise me?

12:35.704 --> 12:38.705
For the last five years,
I've been chasing a phantom.

12:38.707 --> 12:42.391
A name whispered across
time and in every language.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.146
Mallus.

12:46.148 --> 12:49.383
The Phantom Mollusk? An evil shellfish?

12:49.385 --> 12:51.452
"Mall-us."

12:51.454 --> 12:55.000
An evil so ancient and
powerful that the Time Masters

12:55.003 --> 12:56.490
dared not speak his name.

12:56.492 --> 12:59.526
Now, I believe that
he is recruiting allies

12:59.528 --> 13:01.562
from throughout time to his cause.

13:01.564 --> 13:03.397
Now, anachronisms are the result

13:03.399 --> 13:05.332
of your breaking time.

13:05.334 --> 13:06.700
It was her idea.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.635
But these outliers,

13:08.637 --> 13:10.037
they are most certainly

13:10.039 --> 13:11.605
the work of Mallus.

13:11.607 --> 13:14.775
Now, the Time Bureau is a bureaucracy

13:14.777 --> 13:16.310
and lacks the imagination

13:16.312 --> 13:18.912
to understand this particular threat.

13:18.914 --> 13:21.947
And Director Bennett
objects to my crusade.

13:21.950 --> 13:23.415
Hmm.

13:26.322 --> 13:28.155
I'm alone out here.

13:28.157 --> 13:29.690
So what I'm hearing is,

13:29.692 --> 13:31.358
your hot new girlfriend dumped you

13:31.360 --> 13:32.960
and now you're crawling back to your ex.

13:33.778 --> 13:35.762
And I'm no one's side piece.

13:35.764 --> 13:38.732
You know, I think they're
onto something here.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.801
Look, sweetie.

13:40.803 --> 13:43.403
We would love to take you
back, but we don't know

13:43.405 --> 13:45.405
how we could trust you again.

13:46.609 --> 13:50.611
Would circumstances be any
different if I were to call off

13:50.613 --> 13:54.181
my hot new girlfriend's pursuit of you?

13:54.183 --> 13:56.275
Hmm.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.088
Deal.

14:03.392 --> 14:04.892
All right, what's your plan?

14:04.894 --> 14:07.227
Right, this outlier... The vampire...

14:07.230 --> 14:09.592
Is most likely the objective of Mallus.

14:09.595 --> 14:13.367
Catch the vampire, catch Mallus.

14:13.369 --> 14:15.035
Sounds like we're
gonna need vampire bait.

14:15.037 --> 14:16.169
Yep.

14:20.209 --> 14:21.842
Me?

14:21.844 --> 14:23.010
Is it 'cause I'm handsome?

14:23.012 --> 14:24.278
Pretty.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.946
Pretty handsome.

14:32.555 --> 14:34.988
Overcrowding and
poverty made Whitechapel

14:34.990 --> 14:36.924
a breeding ground for criminal activity,

14:36.926 --> 14:40.027
culminating in the Ripper's
murders right around...

14:40.029 --> 14:42.029
well, now.

14:42.031 --> 14:43.397
Isn't history fascinating?

14:43.399 --> 14:45.098
It certainly is.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.402
Trusting the Englishman
was a damn mistake.

14:48.404 --> 14:51.171
You know we're all on
comms, don't you, Mr. Rory?

14:51.173 --> 14:53.674
I don't give a rat's ass.

14:53.676 --> 14:55.943
No sign of any vampires.

14:55.945 --> 14:58.312
I wish this was like
a Kristen Stewart type,

14:58.314 --> 15:00.480
all broody and sparkly.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.349
Vampires don't sparkle.

15:02.351 --> 15:04.151
You know, Mick, you and the vamp

15:04.153 --> 15:05.719
have a lot in common.

15:05.721 --> 15:08.855
You both like to sleep
in, and, you know,

15:08.857 --> 15:11.291
kill people.

15:19.535 --> 15:21.668
Stein? What are you doing out here?

15:21.670 --> 15:24.338
Looking for you, dear boy.

15:28.811 --> 15:30.177
Nate.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.445
Nate?

15:34.516 --> 15:35.916
We seem to have lost Dr. Heywood.

15:35.918 --> 15:37.651
Nate, answer me.

15:37.653 --> 15:38.653
Look.

15:42.558 --> 15:44.558
- He's got Dr. Heywood.
- Let's cut him off.

15:51.433 --> 15:53.600
Whoa!

16:01.569 --> 16:03.969
Well, that was invigorating.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.582
You find Pretty?

16:08.584 --> 16:10.417
No, we lost him.

16:10.419 --> 16:11.985
We found potatoes.

16:13.789 --> 16:16.790
Never fear. The game's afoot.

16:33.055 --> 16:35.856
"Methought I heard a voice cry,

16:35.858 --> 16:38.859
'Sleep no more!'"

16:38.861 --> 16:41.395
Professor Stein?

16:41.397 --> 16:43.697
No. Shakespeare, actually.

16:43.699 --> 16:46.800
And it's Sir Stein to you.

16:46.802 --> 16:49.937
It's not every actor who is knighted.

16:49.939 --> 16:52.197
Oh, God. This can't be happening.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.710
Thanks to your lifeblood,
my master will finally

16:56.712 --> 16:58.345
make his return.

16:58.347 --> 17:01.482
But there's much to be
done in the meantime.

17:06.188 --> 17:09.036
Yeah, well, that wasn't creepy.

17:09.039 --> 17:10.156
Ow.

17:11.458 --> 17:12.526
Sara?

17:12.528 --> 17:14.313
Nate, where are you?

17:14.316 --> 17:16.549
I don't know, but I just had a chat

17:16.551 --> 17:19.633
with Professor Stein's
weird lookalike evil cousin.

17:19.636 --> 17:22.088
Great-great grandfather, to be exact.

17:22.090 --> 17:24.592
The famous stage
actor, Sir Henry Stein.

17:24.594 --> 17:26.359
Astonishing.

17:26.362 --> 17:28.872
The... the chances of us
running into one of my ancestors

17:28.875 --> 17:30.642
are astronomical.

17:30.645 --> 17:32.266
Family lore recalls him

17:32.268 --> 17:34.091
as being an eccentric.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.716
But then, what can one
expect from an actor?

17:36.719 --> 17:38.405
He's also an occult weirdo

17:38.407 --> 17:40.708
who kidnapped me to feed his master.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.643
Excellent. The vampire
will lead us to Mallus.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.245
Stay where you are, Dr. Heywood.

17:44.247 --> 17:46.046
Yeah, that's not gonna be a problem.

17:46.048 --> 17:48.582
Whatever they roofied me
with fritzed out my powers.

17:48.584 --> 17:50.551
Can you describe where you are?

17:50.553 --> 17:54.388
Uh, like a... an operating room?

17:54.390 --> 17:57.825
All I know is there's a
spooky-ass red moon painting

17:57.828 --> 17:59.026
on the wall.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.817
- What's that?
- It's, uh...

18:02.820 --> 18:04.341
It's some of my research on Mallus.

18:04.344 --> 18:07.369
"Beware the blood-red moon,
when the door that separates

18:07.372 --> 18:09.806
death from life will be opened."

18:09.809 --> 18:11.130
It's the first line of an oath

18:11.133 --> 18:12.966
taken by the Order of
the Shrouded Compass,

18:12.969 --> 18:15.770
an infamous secret society
of London's aristocracy

18:15.773 --> 18:17.773
obsessed with the occult.

18:17.776 --> 18:20.481
That sounds like the perfect
place for an out-of-time vampire

18:20.483 --> 18:21.583
to take refuge.

18:21.586 --> 18:23.354
Yes, well, the Order also believe

18:23.357 --> 18:24.833
in the magical properties

18:24.836 --> 18:26.902
associated with...

18:26.905 --> 18:28.772
a total lunar eclipse.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.844
Which is set to occur right
here in London tonight.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.412
If I wasn't vampire hunting,

18:51.414 --> 18:54.181
I'd rob these rich bastards blind.

18:54.183 --> 18:57.651
Hunting a tiger for sport
is... Is just perverse.

18:57.653 --> 18:59.820
I can't believe we're in a
time where women can't vote

18:59.822 --> 19:01.221
and the Internet's not a thing.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.057
Savages.

19:06.087 --> 19:08.654
Anyone who doesn't have a reflection,

19:08.656 --> 19:10.098
they're getting a stake.

19:10.101 --> 19:11.634
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:11.637 --> 19:14.025
if I could have your attention, please.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.928
Truly uncanny.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.364
It's that 'stache that's astonishing.

19:18.366 --> 19:23.235
I know you're not here for
idle chitchat and aperitifs.

19:23.237 --> 19:27.339
So please allow me to introduce
the star of the evening,

19:27.341 --> 19:30.810
a famed mystic who has come
all the way from America

19:30.812 --> 19:34.613
to communicate with the dead.

19:34.615 --> 19:37.183
Madame Eleanor.

19:43.221 --> 19:45.642
Can't believe people
are buying this garbage.

19:45.645 --> 19:48.294
I sense...

19:48.296 --> 19:49.862
someone in the room

19:49.864 --> 19:52.728
who longs to speak to
a departed loved one.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.037
Come.

19:58.039 --> 20:00.206
Sit at my table, if you have no fear.

20:03.177 --> 20:06.226
Since we can't hack the
watch for its GPS data,

20:06.229 --> 20:08.830
we're gonna have to solve
this one the old-fashioned way.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.350
With fingerprints.

20:11.352 --> 20:13.185
Okay, we got the coroner's fingerprints.

20:13.187 --> 20:15.121
- Uh-huh.
- And the second one is mine,

20:15.123 --> 20:17.490
obviously, and the third
one is unidentifiable,

20:17.492 --> 20:19.792
and the fourth one is...

20:19.794 --> 20:22.654
Oliver Queen?

20:22.657 --> 20:25.525
Oliver's a s me-traveling
vampire from the future?

20:25.528 --> 20:26.766
We got to call Team Arrow,

20:26.768 --> 20:28.768
figure out what the heck's going on.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.937
♪ Return of the Mack ♪

20:31.939 --> 20:33.330
♪ Pump up the world ♪

20:33.333 --> 20:35.068
♪ Return of the Mack ♪

20:35.071 --> 20:36.571
♪ Watch my flow ♪

20:36.574 --> 20:38.591
♪ Return of the Mack, you know... ♪

20:38.594 --> 20:40.330
About time.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.452
I'm as excited as you are.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.388
But we all must wait
for the blood-red moon

20:49.390 --> 20:51.891
before the ceremony may begin.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.828
Oh, gross.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.563
If you need me, I'll be, um...

20:57.565 --> 20:58.597
I'll be right over here.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.701
Sara, I could really
use a rescue right now.

21:02.703 --> 21:04.837
We're working on it.

21:06.741 --> 21:09.108
Do you remember our mission
from the Greyhill Building?

21:09.110 --> 21:10.810
Like it was yesterday.

21:13.214 --> 21:15.614
Oh, excuse me. Uh...

21:15.616 --> 21:19.041
Could you tell me where
the powder room is?

21:19.044 --> 21:20.586
Oh!

21:25.660 --> 21:27.293
Oh, I've missed this.

21:30.565 --> 21:33.199
Everyone, please join hands.

21:36.750 --> 21:40.973
There is a doubter among us.

21:40.975 --> 21:43.909
I, too, was a skeptic once,

21:43.911 --> 21:47.112
before the spirits spoke to me.

21:47.114 --> 21:50.716
But now I am their conduit.

22:08.336 --> 22:10.936
Khaahar.

22:12.204 --> 22:15.772
Do you remember the
night they came for us?

22:15.775 --> 22:17.909
How fast you ran?

22:20.449 --> 22:23.576
You abandoned me, Khaahar.

22:25.585 --> 22:28.786
You let them kill me so you could live.

22:31.993 --> 22:35.950
- No.
- You are scared now.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.823
Just as you were scared

22:39.834 --> 22:42.968
of A.R.G.U.S. then.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.817
So much fear.

22:46.173 --> 22:48.458
You were my big sister.

22:50.611 --> 22:52.544
You should have protected me.

22:52.546 --> 22:54.613
- Please...
- Stop this at once.

22:54.615 --> 22:56.582
You heard the lady.

22:58.386 --> 23:00.205
Sara, our cover is blown.

23:00.208 --> 23:01.228
We need to leave.

23:04.191 --> 23:07.459
Wait, the vampire... That was you?

23:07.461 --> 23:10.229
A two-pronged needle
by my own invention

23:10.231 --> 23:11.964
is hardly vampiric.

23:11.966 --> 23:13.265
Then who's the stiff?

23:15.136 --> 23:17.814
- Nate, are you okay?
- Does it look like I'm okay?

23:17.817 --> 23:21.006
Instead of a sexy vampire,
I got stuck with this weirdo.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.875
He's all yours.

23:29.664 --> 23:32.651
The Order has plans for
our time-displaced corpse.

23:32.653 --> 23:35.254
That's why they're kidnapping
men and draining their blood.

23:35.256 --> 23:36.822
It's for their ceremony.

23:37.509 --> 23:38.975
Shall we find out who it is?

23:41.495 --> 23:44.363
Whoa, guys, I am digging the digs.

23:44.365 --> 23:46.165
I mean, I have some
serious lab envy over here.

23:46.167 --> 23:47.599
Yeah? Well, check this out.

23:47.601 --> 23:50.247
Whoa, okay, wow.

23:50.250 --> 23:52.771
Uh, well, I've analyzed
that unidentified print

23:52.773 --> 23:55.074
and got back 100,000 possible variations

23:55.076 --> 23:56.533
on a complete friction ridge.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.344
Okay, so, do we have a match?

23:58.346 --> 24:01.298
Unfortunately. I hope you
guys have a bar on that ship,

24:01.301 --> 24:02.728
because you're gonna need a drink.

24:02.731 --> 24:04.383
The watch belongs to...

24:08.322 --> 24:10.231
Damien Darhk.

24:15.229 --> 24:17.737
Darhk must be integral to Mallus' plan.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.412
We can't leave Damien Darhk's
body to be resurrected.

24:20.414 --> 24:23.082
Uh, Darhk may be a madman,
but he's not the madman

24:23.084 --> 24:24.817
we're presently after.

24:24.819 --> 24:26.719
Guys, we have definitely
overstayed our welcome.

24:32.626 --> 24:34.360
Fall back.

24:39.433 --> 24:41.175
The hell is going on?

24:41.178 --> 24:42.901
We're not killing vampires anymore?

24:42.903 --> 24:44.652
Captain Lance, need I remind you

24:44.655 --> 24:47.005
we are no longer just fixing
ordinary anachronisms here.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.774
Mallus is the only game that matters.

24:48.776 --> 24:50.331
No, it's your game.

24:50.334 --> 24:52.611
We have to stop Damien Darhk
from coming back to life.

24:52.613 --> 24:55.414
And we will. But from all indications,

24:55.416 --> 24:57.449
Mallus is coming here to recruit Darhk.

24:57.451 --> 24:59.651
If we destroy Darhk's
body, we destroy any chance

24:59.653 --> 25:01.734
of apprehending Mallus at
the resurrection ceremony.

25:01.737 --> 25:02.953
If Sara says, "Kill Darhk,"

25:02.956 --> 25:04.050
or "Re-kill Darhk,"

25:04.053 --> 25:06.558
or "Prop him up in a convertible
like 'Weekend at Bernie's, '"

25:06.560 --> 25:08.761
that's what we do,
because she's the captain.

25:08.763 --> 25:12.131
I know that you all want to
destroy Darhk once and for all.

25:12.133 --> 25:14.366
You're just gonna have to be patient.

25:14.368 --> 25:16.468
I'd like to speak to you in private.

25:17.678 --> 25:19.136
Good luck in there.

25:22.276 --> 25:25.811
I'm not letting Damien
Darhk come back to life.

25:25.813 --> 25:28.614
Full stop. You've lost perspective.

25:28.616 --> 25:31.016
You're letting personal
prejudice cloud your judgment.

25:31.018 --> 25:34.286
If I had, I wouldn't
have put Damien Darhk

25:34.288 --> 25:36.655
back into the timeline
and erased his memory

25:36.657 --> 25:39.324
so that he could kill my sister.

25:39.326 --> 25:40.492
Again.

25:40.494 --> 25:42.795
Look, Sara.

25:42.797 --> 25:45.664
I understand how perilous it would be

25:45.666 --> 25:47.232
for Mr. Darhk to return.

25:47.234 --> 25:48.495
Do you?

25:48.498 --> 25:50.198
Because I'm the only one in this room

25:50.201 --> 25:53.769
that's been resurrected,
and it wasn't an improvement.

25:53.772 --> 25:55.128
All right.

25:57.406 --> 25:58.941
You're right.

26:00.981 --> 26:02.614
You've got to understand, Sara,

26:02.616 --> 26:06.084
that I've been chasing
Mallus for so long that...

26:06.086 --> 26:08.687
perhaps it is I who's lost perspective.

26:21.569 --> 26:23.902
Never gonna learn how to knock, are you?

26:26.340 --> 26:28.207
I'm concerned about you.

26:28.209 --> 26:30.876
I know that you think that
woman channeled your brother.

26:32.346 --> 26:34.279
His name was Behrad.

26:34.281 --> 26:38.517
The night A.R.G.U.S. came for us, I ran.

26:38.519 --> 26:41.805
I knew he was staying to
fight, but I was scared.

26:44.912 --> 26:48.227
I left my brother there to die.

26:48.229 --> 26:49.928
You happy?

26:49.930 --> 26:51.463
Now you know my secret.

26:51.465 --> 26:52.847
Sorry.

26:52.850 --> 26:54.951
You know, I don't... I
don't want this anymore.

26:54.954 --> 26:57.101
Whatever's going on with it or with us,

26:57.104 --> 26:58.804
I... I don't care.

26:58.806 --> 27:01.974
That totem is your only
remaining connection to him.

27:01.976 --> 27:03.870
It's not a connection.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.370
It's a reminder...

27:06.373 --> 27:09.481
that I should have
been the one who died.

27:14.388 --> 27:16.292
You know,

27:16.295 --> 27:18.090
it's kind of weird
not being able to sense

27:18.092 --> 27:19.992
Stein's emotions.

27:19.994 --> 27:22.728
Don't tell me you're missing
your psychic connection.

27:22.730 --> 27:25.497
Oh, c-come on. Of course not.

27:25.499 --> 27:28.542
- Well, maybe a little, but...
- Aha!

27:28.545 --> 27:31.103
I've uncovered your ruse.
You've been using my lab...

27:31.105 --> 27:31.964
Your lab?

27:31.967 --> 27:33.909
To impede our psychic connection.

27:33.912 --> 27:37.280
It's the very foundation of Firestorm.

27:37.283 --> 27:38.558
Actually, that's...

27:38.561 --> 27:40.360
That's the foundation of Firestorm.

27:40.363 --> 27:43.169
It's the formulae for
building a thermocore.

27:43.172 --> 27:46.584
No, I was... playing hangman.

27:46.587 --> 27:47.619
Q!

27:47.621 --> 27:49.321
Q...

27:49.323 --> 27:51.990
Grey, don't take this out on Ray.

27:51.992 --> 27:54.493
He was just helping me figure
out a way we could, uh...

27:54.495 --> 27:56.395
break up Firestorm.

27:56.397 --> 27:59.464
So that you could go home,
and I could stay on the ship.

27:59.466 --> 28:01.652
Oh, I see.

28:01.655 --> 28:04.169
So are you cool with this?

28:04.171 --> 28:05.637
Why wouldn't I be?

28:05.639 --> 28:07.272
After all, you've only been... Been here

28:07.274 --> 28:10.242
tinkering in secret with
how to split up a walking,

28:10.244 --> 28:12.244
talking, living nuclear reactor.

28:12.246 --> 28:14.446
- Of course I'm cool with it.
- Okay.

28:14.448 --> 28:17.482
After everything we've been through,

28:17.484 --> 28:19.885
how could you attempt
something of this magnitude

28:19.887 --> 28:21.753
behind my back?

28:21.755 --> 28:23.055
Grey, it's not like...

28:31.599 --> 28:35.300
Oh, it seems we both share
a craving for solitude.

28:35.302 --> 28:38.604
- Is everyone aboard the ship?
- As far as I'm aware.

28:38.606 --> 28:40.939
Is there something I can do for you?

28:40.941 --> 28:42.308
In fact, there is.

28:42.311 --> 28:45.344
If you'd please tell
Captain Lance that...

28:45.346 --> 28:46.346
I'm sorry.

28:47.881 --> 28:49.378
What are you doing?

28:49.381 --> 28:51.850
Gideon, initiate
Gentleman's Dreadnought.

28:51.852 --> 28:55.120
Command code recognized. Are
you sure, Director Hunter?

28:55.122 --> 28:56.888
She left me no choice.

28:58.926 --> 29:01.727
- Seven, six, five...
- Gideon!

29:01.729 --> 29:03.962
Four, three, two...

29:03.964 --> 29:05.163
It's Mr. Hunter.

29:05.165 --> 29:06.465
- One.
- What's he done?

29:16.443 --> 29:17.714
All the exits are locked.

29:17.717 --> 29:19.511
And I can't override the command.

29:19.513 --> 29:20.745
Damn it, Rip.

29:20.748 --> 29:23.415
Told you we should never
have trusted the Englishman.

29:23.417 --> 29:25.317
Where's Zari?

29:28.389 --> 29:30.088
Come in.

29:32.092 --> 29:34.426
I was hoping we might meet again.

29:40.243 --> 29:41.631
You channeled my brother earlier.

29:41.634 --> 29:43.862
I need to talk to him again.

29:43.864 --> 29:46.397
Well, I'm sorry.

29:46.399 --> 29:48.900
I cannot merely summon the dead at whim.

29:48.902 --> 29:51.769
Please, I need to tell
him that I'm sorry.

29:51.771 --> 29:53.204
And I have a way to bring him back.

29:53.206 --> 29:55.940
I can save him this time.

29:55.942 --> 29:58.576
I could try.

29:58.578 --> 30:02.514
I would need a memento,
something that belonged to him

30:02.516 --> 30:04.449
that I could focus my energy on.

30:06.152 --> 30:07.952
Would this work?

30:14.294 --> 30:16.470
So much power.

30:18.687 --> 30:20.986
And you give it away so easily.

30:27.474 --> 30:29.807
A mistake you're unlikely to repeat.

30:29.810 --> 30:32.610
- Hmm?
- Madame Eleanor.

30:32.612 --> 30:34.412
The blood-red moon beckons.

30:38.752 --> 30:40.585
Restrain her.

30:41.665 --> 30:43.488
I must prepare for the ceremony.

30:43.490 --> 30:45.089
Damn, Gideon, how many secret commands

30:45.091 --> 30:46.728
did Rip program you with?

30:46.731 --> 30:48.826
I believe this was the
last of them, Captain.

30:48.828 --> 30:50.695
Well, I'm captain now, and I order you

30:50.697 --> 30:53.464
to override Rip's orders and
ready the ship for takeoff.

30:53.466 --> 30:55.567
Right away, Captain Lance.

30:55.569 --> 30:57.068
Director Hunter's command

30:57.070 --> 30:58.636
allows you to fly the Waverider,

30:58.638 --> 31:00.194
just not let any of you off of it.

31:00.197 --> 31:01.873
Well, it's a start.

31:01.875 --> 31:03.708
Plot a course for the Shrouded Compass.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.228
Damn right, Cap-i-tan.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.536
And bring the ship's
weapon system online.

31:07.546 --> 31:09.158
Needless to say, it's highly likely that

31:09.161 --> 31:10.594
Mr. Hunter is in that building.

31:10.597 --> 31:12.463
And I'm willing to bet that so is Zari.

31:12.466 --> 31:14.585
You want an omelet, you
got to crack a few eggs.

31:36.977 --> 31:38.775
When you welcomed me to the Order,

31:38.778 --> 31:40.778
you were seeking proof.

31:40.780 --> 31:44.349
Evidence that life does
not have to end with death.

31:46.219 --> 31:48.219
But the power that
courses through my veins

31:48.221 --> 31:49.854
is not mine own.

31:49.856 --> 31:51.356
It is a gift.

31:51.358 --> 31:52.924
From Mallus.

32:01.568 --> 32:03.704
Stop this abomination!

32:14.014 --> 32:17.448
Your so-called master, where is he?

32:17.450 --> 32:20.051
Mallus is everywhere and nowhere,

32:20.053 --> 32:23.054
refracted in every moment of time.

32:23.056 --> 32:24.956
He is dead.

32:24.958 --> 32:26.724
He is risen.

32:26.726 --> 32:28.559
And he will come again.

32:28.561 --> 32:30.728
Right, well, that's very cryptic.

32:30.730 --> 32:33.665
But I demand to speak to him.

32:33.667 --> 32:34.884
Oh.

32:34.887 --> 32:37.045
Well, very well.

32:46.613 --> 32:48.913
Director Hunter.

32:48.915 --> 32:51.173
A pleasure to meet you.

32:51.176 --> 32:54.652
Oh, I'm not here to
speak to your puppet.

32:54.654 --> 32:58.356
I think it's about time
you and I met face-to-face.

33:00.894 --> 33:04.195
You cannot look upon
my true form and live.

33:04.197 --> 33:08.700
While you are hopelessly
mortal, I am a god.

33:21.347 --> 33:23.715
You're too late.

33:41.134 --> 33:44.402
It's good to be back.

33:56.149 --> 33:57.783
Who stole my watch?

33:57.786 --> 33:59.851
Our coordinates say we're
right above the Order.

33:59.853 --> 34:02.587
- Prepare the shock-missiles.
- Three pages left.

34:02.589 --> 34:04.322
What are you doing? Zari's in there.

34:04.324 --> 34:06.290
I need you to target the cargo bay.

34:06.292 --> 34:07.792
Our cargo bay?

34:07.794 --> 34:09.469
Shouldn't we have a team vote first?

34:09.473 --> 34:11.562
If anybody has a better idea
how to get the ship open,

34:11.563 --> 34:13.364
now's the time.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.501
Trust me, Jax. Fire.

34:19.254 --> 34:21.286
Shock-missiles away, Captain.

34:22.909 --> 34:26.110
Oh, this is gonna suck so bad.

34:26.112 --> 34:27.911
Uh, Grey, if we're gonna die,

34:27.914 --> 34:29.471
I don't want us to go
out mad at each other.

34:29.473 --> 34:31.815
So, uh, I can't remember
what for, but I'm sorry.

34:31.818 --> 34:33.284
You were just thinking of me.

34:33.286 --> 34:34.985
Actually, I should be thanking you.

34:34.987 --> 34:36.687
Aww, who wants to hold hands?

34:36.688 --> 34:38.656
Ray, it's not freakin' "Toy Story 3."

34:38.658 --> 34:40.858
Everyone shut up. I got one page left.

35:56.769 --> 36:00.404
Any last words, Rip?
Yes, I remember you.

36:00.406 --> 36:02.240
I remember everything.

36:11.517 --> 36:14.118
Remember us?

36:14.120 --> 36:16.554
Oh, goodie. More Legends.

36:16.556 --> 36:18.162
Here to kill me, I assume.

36:18.165 --> 36:19.958
This time it'll stick.

36:31.165 --> 36:32.760
That's my totem.

36:44.817 --> 36:48.152
Let's go. Till we meet again.

37:14.647 --> 37:17.020
Mmm, not bad. A little tart.

37:17.023 --> 37:19.084
If you can believe it, Clarissa prefers

37:19.087 --> 37:20.784
- to eat her grapefruit...
- With salt.

37:20.786 --> 37:22.934
Yeah, I remember.

37:22.937 --> 37:24.437
How...

37:26.090 --> 37:29.225
I got Ray to restore
our psychic connection.

37:29.228 --> 37:31.161
I can feel how much
you're missing your family.

37:31.163 --> 37:33.864
Ever since baby Ronnie was
born, it's only gotten worse.

37:33.866 --> 37:36.567
It's like there's a hole in my chest.

37:36.570 --> 37:38.636
I'm so sorry.

37:38.639 --> 37:42.272
I never expected the
birth of my grandson

37:42.274 --> 37:44.341
would make being away
that much more painful.

37:44.343 --> 37:47.678
And I certainly never wanted
you to share this burden.

37:47.680 --> 37:50.090
But with this new Mallus threat,

37:50.093 --> 37:52.950
and the return of Damien Darhk,

37:52.952 --> 37:55.185
the team needs Firestorm more than ever.

37:55.187 --> 37:57.387
Yeah, and the team can get Firestorm,

37:57.389 --> 37:58.922
and you can go home,

37:58.924 --> 38:02.793
if we can stabilize
the Matrix into my body.

38:02.796 --> 38:04.629
T.S. Eliot once said,

38:04.632 --> 38:07.965
"Only those who risk going
too far can possibly find out

38:07.967 --> 38:11.234
how far one can go."

38:11.236 --> 38:13.103
So, when do we start?

38:13.105 --> 38:15.138
As soon as I, uh,

38:15.140 --> 38:17.040
fix that giant hole in the cargo bay.

38:17.042 --> 38:19.509
- Well, good luck with that.
- Yeah.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.750
Yeah.

38:32.524 --> 38:34.424
Knock, knock.

38:34.426 --> 38:36.460
Still not knocking.

38:38.330 --> 38:40.263
You want to sit?

38:40.265 --> 38:42.299
Sure. Thanks.

38:45.537 --> 38:48.639
This is gonna sound weird, but...

38:48.641 --> 38:50.807
when my amulet came back to me,

38:50.810 --> 38:53.877
I felt Behrad's presence.

38:53.879 --> 38:56.480
Like, almost like he was with me.

38:56.482 --> 38:59.416
That doesn't sound weird at all.

38:59.418 --> 39:02.519
God, first A.R.G.U.S.,
then that Water Witch.

39:02.521 --> 39:05.555
And now some formerly dead
guy all want to kill me.

39:05.557 --> 39:09.126
My ancestor told me that
the totems' strength grows

39:09.128 --> 39:12.729
when the threats we face
become more powerful.

39:12.731 --> 39:14.895
Fantastic.

39:14.898 --> 39:17.034
I think what she meant is that

39:17.036 --> 39:20.404
you and I are gonna
become great friends.

39:20.406 --> 39:24.775
And we'll defeat whatever
evil comes, together.

39:24.777 --> 39:26.009
I like that.

39:37.368 --> 39:39.322
We need to talk.

39:39.324 --> 39:41.458
By now you know me better
than to expect an apology.

39:41.460 --> 39:44.461
Agents are dead because of you.

39:44.463 --> 39:46.697
They understood the
risks of their profession.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.168
But we learned so much from
the events of last night.

39:51.170 --> 39:52.636
Next time...

39:52.638 --> 39:55.872
There won't be a next time, Rip.

39:55.874 --> 39:57.441
You show up out of nowhere

39:57.443 --> 39:59.309
practically begging for our help,

39:59.311 --> 40:01.645
and then you betray us.

40:01.647 --> 40:03.880
You've gone rogue
from every organization

40:03.882 --> 40:05.182
that you've ever been a part of.

40:05.184 --> 40:07.384
'Cause you don't trust anyone.

40:07.386 --> 40:09.853
I don't know how I could
have ever trusted you.

40:09.855 --> 40:12.689
Sara, I need you with
me now more than ever.

40:12.691 --> 40:14.224
Do you remember when you told me

40:14.226 --> 40:15.926
you had nothing left to teach me?

40:15.928 --> 40:18.095
I guess you had one final lesson.

40:21.867 --> 40:24.301
How to be a cold son of a bitch.

40:26.505 --> 40:30.307
- Director Bennett.
- Director Hunter.

40:30.309 --> 40:32.209
You've called in your last chit.

40:32.211 --> 40:34.745
I should never have sanctioned
last night's mission.

40:34.747 --> 40:38.348
But the mission proved
that Mallus is real.

40:38.350 --> 40:40.016
Explain it to the tribunal.

40:40.018 --> 40:42.219
In the meantime, you are being detained

40:42.221 --> 40:44.588
and suspended from active duty.

40:44.590 --> 40:47.924
You can't detain me.
I... I created the Bureau.

40:47.926 --> 40:49.926
Then you of all people should know

40:49.928 --> 40:52.062
that no one is exempt from its rules.

40:53.866 --> 40:55.132
Agent Sharpe.

41:00.773 --> 41:03.707
Thank you for notifying us of
Director Hunter's whereabouts.

41:03.709 --> 41:06.109
Now the Legends are
free to fly the skies?

41:06.111 --> 41:07.878
Affirmative.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.780
The Time Bureau has bigger
things to worry about

41:09.782 --> 41:12.048
than a bunch of idiots.

41:16.755 --> 41:18.755
Mallus is getting
stronger, Captain Lance.

41:18.757 --> 41:20.693
Last night was only the beginning.

41:20.696 --> 41:22.396
There is a war coming.

41:22.399 --> 41:25.867
And history needs you to be ready.

41:25.870 --> 41:27.697
You and the rest of the Legends.
