WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.407
Previously on ER:

00:06.440 --> 00:08.576
I was wondering if you found
a permanent replacement

00:08.609 --> 00:10.211
for the Chief
of Emergency Medicine.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.512
Is there someone you
want to recommend?

00:11.545 --> 00:12.446
Yeah, me.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.082
You're doctors now.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.149
Time to stop
thinking like
med students

00:15.183 --> 00:16.450
and take on
a real patient load.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.086
You like it
over there at Luka's?

00:18.119 --> 00:19.320
Guess so.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.521
You like him, too, right?

00:20.554 --> 00:21.622
Yeah. Why?

00:21.655 --> 00:22.523
You two decide yet?

00:22.556 --> 00:24.258
About moving in?

00:24.292 --> 00:25.659
Don't. Not unless you
want to kill the romance.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.561
They're on their
best behavior at first

00:27.595 --> 00:29.163
and then, before you know it,
they're farting in the can.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.732
Thanks for your help today.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.301
Sure.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.702
If you wait for a second,
I'll, uh...

00:34.735 --> 00:35.736
walk out with you.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.179
Dr. Lewis, phone call.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.714
Tell them I'll be back
downstairs in a minute.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.516
Seems kind of persistent.
Someone called Chuck.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.717
Oh, yeah.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.852
Hi, Chuck.
I can't talk right now.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.455
Cosmo ate the yams?
Okay.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.224
Yes, sure, of course
I'm thrilled.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.392
It's just that I'm late
for a meeting with Weaver.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.362
No, no, no, I'm glad you called,
just Chuck... Chuck.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.663
Chuck, I gotta go.

01:02.696 --> 01:05.666
I'll call you back,
okay? Bye.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.168
How's Chuck?

01:07.201 --> 01:08.669
He's fine. Thank you.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.304
He's, uh, you know,
he's excited

01:10.338 --> 01:11.505
'cause Cosmo ate yams
for the first time.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.773
You know how babies are--

01:12.806 --> 01:14.208
they like the bananas
or the apples.

01:14.242 --> 01:16.377
Henry loved the yam
right from the get-go.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.312
So, as to your one-month
performance review...

01:18.346 --> 01:19.813
Performance
review? Now?

01:19.847 --> 01:22.383
You've been Emergency Chief
for 30 days

01:22.416 --> 01:23.751
and I think it's gone well.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.819
Staff feels positive.
"Esprit de corps" is high.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.755
That's good to hear.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.391
Which isn't to say
there haven't been
a few little glitches.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.261
First, the average wait time
to see a physician

01:33.294 --> 01:34.728
is almost ten hours.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.764
I think we'd all agree
that's a bit excessive.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.799
Second, we had
a record number of patients

01:38.832 --> 01:40.334
leave without treatment,

01:40.368 --> 01:42.503
which resulted in a record
number of complaints

01:42.536 --> 01:43.804
coming directly
to the administration.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.206
That would be me.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.307
Yes, Kerry,
I've tried...

01:46.340 --> 01:48.342
Third, the number
of bounce-backs

01:48.376 --> 01:50.611
in under 48 hours
was up 11%,

01:50.644 --> 01:53.314
signifying an increased rate
of misdiagnoses,

01:53.347 --> 01:56.450
improper treatment and really
just poor follow-up planning.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.551
Kerry, you can give
it to me straight.

01:57.585 --> 01:58.419
If this isn't working out...

01:58.452 --> 01:59.587
Oh, don't be silly.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.588
I think you're doing
a great job.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.190
I just wanted to make you aware

02:02.223 --> 02:04.325
that there are still many,
many, many, many problems

02:04.358 --> 02:06.227
for you to work on.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.429
And if there's one word I can't
emphasize enough, Susan--

02:08.461 --> 02:10.398
it's leadership.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.765
That's it. Carry on.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.243
Still waiting on transport
for Mr. Lemley.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.777
Thanks, Jerry.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.346
From when you
were in Africa?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.215
No, these are new.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.582
Kem just e-mailed me these.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.917
I was going to print them up.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.320
She looks happy...

02:32.353 --> 02:34.822
Uh, which is nice,
considering...

02:34.855 --> 02:36.357
Yeah, she does.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.825
Oh, very nice.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.527
Anyone I should
get to know?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.662
You're not her type.

02:41.695 --> 02:42.830
Paramedics at
the back door.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.498
Lewis is upstairs
with Weaver.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.600
We'll take it,
won't we, Doctor?

02:49.237 --> 02:51.472
Hey, that's Carter's,
uh, whatever, right?

02:51.505 --> 02:52.740
Mm-hmm.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.742
Man, I could look
at her all day.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.610
60-year-old woman,
multiple facial injuries,

02:56.644 --> 02:58.812
chest wall contusions
and deformities to both arms.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.713
What's your name, ma'am?

02:59.747 --> 03:00.614
Ruh-eze.

03:00.648 --> 03:01.515
Might be Louise.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.384
There's no ID.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.885
She was found in an alley,
no purse, wallet, anything.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.454
What happened?

03:06.487 --> 03:07.788
She could've fallen
out of a window

03:07.821 --> 03:09.557
or dumped from a car,
I don't know.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.725
BP: 124/74,
tachy at 118.

03:11.759 --> 03:12.793
She's going to need an airway.

03:12.826 --> 03:13.894
Let's clear
her neck first.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.299
C-spine looks good.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.700
Does that mean
I can talk to her?

03:19.733 --> 03:20.834
You can take
the C-collar off.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.002
Sit her up to 30 degrees.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.671
No.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.407
You need a hand in here?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.976
Facial fractures,
pulmonary contusions,

03:29.009 --> 03:31.379
fractured wrist,
fractured hands.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.446
Name is Louise.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.847
Hi, Louise.
I'm Sam.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.616
Let us know if this
makes you at all dizzy.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.617
I...

03:36.650 --> 03:37.785
Don't talk
if it hurts.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553
Dr. Carter, your COPD guy's

03:39.587 --> 03:41.021
seizing in Curtain Four.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.423
Okay, go.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.292
8-0 ET tube
is ready to go.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.459
Not so fast.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.627
I...

03:46.660 --> 03:47.828
( moans )

03:47.861 --> 03:49.530
I'm sorry, I
know it hurts.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.864
Pulse ox 82. I'm moving her
up to five liters.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.866
No intubation.
It's a LeFort Two.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.435
She's going to need surgery.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.603
She can't have an oral tube.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.870
Okay, can I crike her?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.472
No, you're going
to observe quietly.

03:58.506 --> 04:00.974
Louise, you have
a broken jaw

04:01.008 --> 04:02.710
and broken bones in your face.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.911
Wait...
Now, we're
going to put

04:03.944 --> 04:05.646
a breathing tube in your neck.

04:05.679 --> 04:06.980
We'll numb you and sedate you
for the procedure.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.316
Wait... Wait!

04:10.851 --> 04:13.787
I... was raped.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:32.032 --> 05:33.567
Excuse me.

05:36.003 --> 05:36.837
I'll be back,

05:36.870 --> 05:37.838
okay?

05:42.810 --> 05:43.844
Are you the one
the, uh...?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.546
We've got the rape kit.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.814
Got 'em done
while she was out.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.981
She doesn't need
any more trauma.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.149
Right.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.484
Well, her full name
is Louise Garvin.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.985
We canvassed
the neighborhood.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.622
Her apartment's right above
the alley where she was found.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.856
Anyone see anything?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.691
No. There were signs
of a struggle inside.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.126
It seems like she
got away from him,

05:59.159 --> 06:01.829
and then maybe took a fall
coming down the fire escape.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.796
Have you found
any family?

06:02.830 --> 06:03.897
Not yet.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.132
Detectives are
handling the case,

06:05.165 --> 06:06.567
and they're going
to be here shortly.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.435
They're going to want
to talk to her

06:07.468 --> 06:08.168
to you and the doc.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.837
Yeah, fine.
Hey, Jerry.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.838
When the detectives get
here for Louise Garvin,

06:10.871 --> 06:12.506
will you come find me?
Okay.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.508
We can't have patients
sitting around for ten hours

06:14.542 --> 06:15.809
waiting to be seen.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.545
You need to adhere
to a 15-minute rule.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.146
Even if you're busy,
the patient needs

06:19.179 --> 06:21.749
to be seen within 15 minutes
of hitting the gurney. Okay?

06:21.782 --> 06:22.850
Okay.
Whatever.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.851
Sure.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.852
And we have a serious issue

06:24.885 --> 06:26.520
with bounce-backs.

06:26.554 --> 06:29.189
Oh, man, I was supposed
to suture that head lac in Two.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.459
Okay, bounce-backs.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.962
I need you all to provide
after-care instructions--

06:34.995 --> 06:36.864
written--
directly to the patient.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.998
Make sure they understand...

06:38.031 --> 06:39.500
Were you going

06:39.533 --> 06:40.534
to take that belly pain
in Curtain Three?

06:40.568 --> 06:41.769
Yes, I was.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.870
Make sure they
understand the plan

06:42.903 --> 06:44.104
and that they know to go

06:44.137 --> 06:45.939
to their clinic
or primary for follow-up.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.742
Did you get the labs back
on that renal colic?

06:48.776 --> 06:50.478
Still waiting.
What do those guys want?

06:50.511 --> 06:51.945
I got them a crate
of Cracker Jacks.

06:54.682 --> 06:58.552
Uh... what's the, um...
about the follow-ups?

07:00.588 --> 07:01.922
Okay. Mi-Cha Pak?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.156
Mi-Cha, am I saying
that correctly?

07:03.190 --> 07:03.991
Yes.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.225
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.560
Tell me about the pain
you're having.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.095
It hurts here.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.497
Okay.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.098
And is it constant
or does it

07:11.131 --> 07:12.099
come and go?

07:12.132 --> 07:13.200
Comes and goes.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.735
I think it's a kidney stone.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.736
My father had one.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.504
( loud clang )

07:16.537 --> 07:17.137
Hey! Morris!

07:17.170 --> 07:18.506
Sorry, okay. Sorry.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.509
What about a kidney stone?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.577
Her father had one.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.712
And are you...

07:24.745 --> 07:26.514
Sorry. Sorry.
What is your problem?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.948
No problem, we're all set here.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.150
Sorry again.

07:30.183 --> 07:34.855
Um... vomiting or fever?
Any vomiting or fever?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.057
I think maybe I'm better.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.058
I could probably go.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.860
No, no, no.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.094
As long as you're here,
we'll take a look at you, okay?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.195
We'll get you
in a gown, okay?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.564
Okay.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.898
And I'll be back
to examine you.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.034
So, you two moving in?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.869
Girl, that's
getting serious.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.871
With Luka?
That's getting lucky.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.773
It just seemed to make
more sense, you know?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.543
That's what my girlfriend said
when she moved in six years ago.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.645
So that's why you two are
always coming in together.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.913
No, Jerry, we just moved
our stuff over last night.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.114
We haven't even
unpacked our boxes.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.850
Living together
is for wimps.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.685
Real commitment
comes with a ring.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.587
Yeah, my girlfriend's
on that one, too.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.155
Excuse me.
I'm Detective Patrie.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.692
I'm here about, uh...
Louise Garvin.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.727
Yeah, she's over here.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.295
She's in rough shape.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.765
As soon as a bed opens up,
we'll send her up to the ICU.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.000
Did she say anything other
than that she'd been raped?

08:20.033 --> 08:21.802
She could barely
get that out.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.937
She's got a crike tube now,
can't talk at all,

08:23.971 --> 08:24.938
and two broken arms.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.141
Hi, Louise.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.777
This is
Detective Patrie.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.311
He's investigating
your case.

08:31.344 --> 08:35.982
Hi. May I call
you Louise?

08:36.015 --> 08:38.885
I'm so sorry
about what happened.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.020
I know this is difficult,
but I'm going to need

08:41.054 --> 08:43.090
to ask you some questions
if you're up to it.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.061
Now, the man who raped you--

08:48.095 --> 08:50.097
was he someone you knew,
a friend

08:50.130 --> 08:51.599
or an acquaintance?

08:53.133 --> 08:57.037
Anyone you saw around your
building or neighborhood?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.142
Was he alone?

09:05.212 --> 09:06.714
It's just a mucus plug.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.682
Louise, I'm going to have
to suction you out

09:08.716 --> 09:10.017
since you can't cough
this stuff up.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.719
Can I still talk to her?

09:14.988 --> 09:15.989
( coughing )

09:25.766 --> 09:27.735
Yeah.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.671
Louise, was he alone?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.976
Did you get a good look at him?

09:36.009 --> 09:38.746
Would you be able to identify
him if you saw him again?

09:41.982 --> 09:44.885
You know, I think that's enough
for now.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.219
When will she be able to talk?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.655
We'll have to ask Dr. Kovac.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.726
It's a gravid abdomen.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.063
Ow! It hurts.
It hurts now.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.397
I need sterile gloves, surgilube

09:57.430 --> 09:59.032
and help with a pelvic.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.701
When was your last period?

10:00.734 --> 10:01.735
I don't know.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.970
You don't know.
Ow!

10:03.003 --> 10:05.105
Did you have
a gush of water today?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.074
Maybe, when I was peeing.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.408
( screaming )

10:08.441 --> 10:10.911
Oh, God, she's
ten centimeters dilated.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.345
Oh, God, is right.
Effacement?

10:12.379 --> 10:14.915
100%.
Station's 2 plus.

10:14.948 --> 10:15.783
Call OB?

10:15.816 --> 10:16.984
Yeah.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.152
Okay, Mi-Cha, don't push.
All right?

10:19.186 --> 10:20.654
Listen to me and focus.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.889
I need you to pant
when the pain comes.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.223
And don't push.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.792
Hey, Chuny, can you help me
with this gurney?

10:24.825 --> 10:25.993
Is she having a baby?

10:26.026 --> 10:27.227
I'm not pregnant.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.698
Pulmonary contusions
are getting worse.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.065
That's why she can't talk.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.734
She was punched
so hard in the chest

10:33.767 --> 10:35.068
that her lungs are bruised--

10:35.102 --> 10:37.137
swelling, fluid,
bleeding in the air sacs...

10:37.170 --> 10:38.739
Sam...

10:38.772 --> 10:40.140
Her condition is critical.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.442
We'll provide oxygen,
wait for the lungs to heal

10:42.475 --> 10:43.744
and hope it doesn't
get any worse.

10:43.777 --> 10:44.377
It could get worse?

10:44.411 --> 10:45.312
Yes, much worse.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.047
Doc, I need to talk to her.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.749
I don't think that's
going to be possible.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.851
The details she could give us
might help solve this case.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.453
This rapist has been assaulting
women all over the Northside.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.422
He's violent, angry,
and she's the first one

10:55.455 --> 10:57.124
who seems like she got
a good look at him.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.258
Isn't there something
we could do?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.426
I think she really
wants to help.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.763
How?
By blinking in Morse code?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.965
We can't miraculously
cure her pulmonary edema.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.133
She's being admitted

11:06.166 --> 11:07.768
to the ICU and then she'll go

11:07.801 --> 11:09.837
for reconstructive surgery
on her facial bones.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.171
In a week or so,
they may be able

11:11.204 --> 11:12.906
to remove the tube
and then she can talk.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.745
( screaming )

11:17.778 --> 11:19.747
Don't push. Don't push.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.148
What's she doing
down here?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.082
LOCKHART:
She didn't know she was pregnant

11:22.115 --> 11:23.016
till I examined her.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.184
Her name's Mi-Cha.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.352
Hi, Mi-Cha.
I'm Dr. Carter.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.353
I'm not pregnant.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.354
Don't push, okay?

11:27.387 --> 11:28.188
( screaming )

11:28.221 --> 11:29.757
Come on. Come on.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.991
Hey, breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.992
Breathe?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.327
BOTH:
Yeah, breathe.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.929
All right, we're not going
to make it. She's crowning.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.330
You want to take it?

11:37.364 --> 11:38.899
No, not in the elevator lobby.
No, thank you.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.167
Okay, give me a BOA kit
and a baby warmer.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.835
( screaming )
Okay, don't push.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.436
Hang in there, Mi-Cha.
You're gonna be okay.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.905
Baby's LOA,

11:44.938 --> 11:46.139
normal presentation.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.275
Okay, Mi-Cha,
now I want you to push.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.043
So push. Push.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.044
Push.

11:51.078 --> 11:51.912
( straining )

11:51.945 --> 11:53.113
A little bit more.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.082
Head's out.
Good, good.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.216
Bulb suction.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.818
Okay, now, stop pushing.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.387
Stop pushing.
Don't push. Don't push.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.155
A little bit more.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.156
And...

12:03.190 --> 12:05.225
there we go.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.827
Cord clamp.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.161
Scissors.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.530
Time of delivery, 11:14.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.065
( baby crying )

12:12.099 --> 12:13.066
Oh, ten fingers.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.802
Ten toes.

12:14.835 --> 12:18.005
You have a beautiful,
healthy baby boy.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.273
You did great.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.375
That's not my baby.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.345
What?

12:25.378 --> 12:26.814
That's not my baby.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.816
( crying )

12:33.821 --> 12:36.824
Abby's not making much progress
with that Korean girl.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.025
Well, give her
a little bit more time.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.827
She was hoping
you could come.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.361
If she can't break
through that girl's denial,

12:41.394 --> 12:42.830
she ought to get Psych
down here.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.097
Is that the message

12:44.131 --> 12:45.498
you'd like me
to give Dr. Lockhart?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.200
All right, Haleh,
why don't you tell her

12:47.234 --> 12:48.535
I'll check in with her
in a few minutes.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.270
Hey, Frank, call a taxi
for Mrs. Donaldson.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.073
Hear you're doing the
"mi casa, su casa" thing.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.141
What?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.242
Hell, it's none of my business.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.253
Detective's still here.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.520
You shouldn't
have been

13:07.554 --> 13:08.956
so dismissive of me
in front of him.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.390
You didn't need
to discuss the details

13:10.423 --> 13:11.458
of Louise's condition.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.326
She deserves
some privacy.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.863
Yeah, and she deserves
a chance to help.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.264
We have an option we
haven't even talked about.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.465
And that is?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.067
If we deflate
the crike balloon,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.436
Louise could whisper.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.138
You want to take
her off the vent?

13:25.172 --> 13:27.140
Just for a few
moments at a time.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.876
She's requiring
100% oxygen.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.177
I take her
off the vent

13:30.210 --> 13:32.112
every time I suction
her, and she's fine.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.247
Come on.
We both know it's possible.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.448
Technically, yes,
but why risk it?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.350
Because she
wants to help.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.518
She does or you do?

13:38.551 --> 13:40.420
What is that
supposed to mean?

13:43.390 --> 13:44.391
You're sensitive about

13:44.424 --> 13:45.625
these kinds
of cases.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.494
What?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.296
You always want to stand up
for women who've been assaulted.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.097
And you don't?

13:50.130 --> 13:51.999
Of course I do.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.971
Maybe because of when
you were with Steve?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.309
Steve never raped me.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.015
Physical abuse,
hitting you?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.249
Oh, this has nothing
to do with that.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.183
Are you sure?

14:10.217 --> 14:11.451
Yeah.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.954
There's a violent rapist
out there.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.123
How are you going
to feel in two days,

14:16.156 --> 14:17.557
two weeks, a month from now

14:17.590 --> 14:20.060
when we get another woman
like Louise in here?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.563
Hey, crit's only

14:23.596 --> 14:26.099
19 on your
GI bleeder.

14:28.936 --> 14:29.937
Go.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.074
Go.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.549
ABBY:
The Korean girl--

14:42.582 --> 14:43.951
her mother's in
the Family Room,

14:43.951 --> 14:45.185
but Mi-Cha is still

14:45.218 --> 14:46.987
kind of living
on another planet.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.989
She's perfectly reasonable
until I mention the baby,

14:49.022 --> 14:50.523
then she looks at me
like I'm nuts.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.060
Well, teenage denial can
be fairly intransigent,

14:53.093 --> 14:54.461
can't necessarily
attack it head-on.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.562
I know.
That's why I...

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
I'll talk to her.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.266
Hi, Mi-Cha.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.500
Hi.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.969
How are you?
How you feeling?

15:02.002 --> 15:03.536
I feel fine.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.105
It's hard
to sleep, though.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.540
That baby cries.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.609
She said my
kidneys are fine.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.011
Yes, they are.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.345
Then can I go home?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.014
No, no, you can't. Not yet.

15:14.047 --> 15:18.185
We're still waiting on
a few more test results.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.619
How long is that going to take?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.254
'Cause my parents get really mad

15:21.288 --> 15:24.224
when I'm not home
right after school.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.026
Well, you're not
in school today.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.995
I still need to be home by 4:00.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.134
Hey, Mi-Cha, have you checked
out this baby over here?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.503
He's pretty
cute.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.439
Why do people keep asking me
about that baby?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.109
We're just wondering
if you like babies,

15:42.142 --> 15:43.343
or if you
ever

15:43.376 --> 15:44.711
wanted to have
a baby.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.379
I don't know.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.647
Maybe when
I'm married.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.483
Who cares?

15:50.517 --> 15:53.220
Want to try holding him?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.188
Why would I do that?

15:55.222 --> 15:56.623
I don't get
why he's

15:56.656 --> 15:58.458
even in here,
I mean, shouldn't his mother

15:58.491 --> 15:59.759
be dealing
with him?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.461
Okay, you just take it easy,
calm down,

16:01.494 --> 16:04.064
and we'll be back in a bit.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.332
Am I going to get out

16:05.365 --> 16:06.333
by 4:00?

16:06.366 --> 16:07.467
Don't know. Hope so.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.704
So, is she pretending
this didn't happen

16:11.738 --> 16:13.773
or does she really believe
she didn't just give birth?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.375
Who knows?

16:15.408 --> 16:17.110
Her dissociative denial
is pretty strong.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.278
And I have her mother
hanging around,

16:18.311 --> 16:19.579
and I can't break
confidentiality

16:19.612 --> 16:21.314
and tell her
about the baby.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.583
Let me guess, this is the
mother walking towards us?

16:23.616 --> 16:25.585
Uh-huh, that's Mrs. Pak.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.587
All right, call Social Services
and Psych again

16:27.620 --> 16:29.056
and get back in there,

16:29.056 --> 16:31.258
see if you
can keep working on her.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.592
Mrs. Pak.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.461
Hello. I'm Dr. Carter.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.463
43-year-old female
took a 15-foot fall.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.766
Blunt head trauma, GCS: 13,
heart rate: 92, BP: 112/72.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.134
Why isn't
she wearing a collar?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.235
What collar?

16:42.269 --> 16:43.136
You're not supposed to talk.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.237
Did you just say "43"?

16:44.271 --> 16:45.538
RAY:
Okay, what do we got?

16:45.572 --> 16:47.274
28-year-old male
penetrating injury

16:47.307 --> 16:48.775
to bilateral
lower extremities...

16:48.808 --> 16:50.510
...with arterial
laceration.
Is Mike gonna go?

16:50.543 --> 16:51.711
Will you ask him
if he'll give me a ride?
Please?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.346
BP's 72 palp.
BP's 72 palp.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.547
I don't think she'd be
talking on a cell phone,

16:54.581 --> 16:56.683
and I don't think
she's a male.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.086
Uh, we're here now.
I gotta go.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.220
39-year-old female,

17:00.253 --> 17:01.488
crush injury to the chest
and abdomen,

17:01.521 --> 17:02.722
ST elevations
on the strip.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.590
I'm sorry,
I know I just got here,

17:04.624 --> 17:06.425
but where are the bathrooms?

17:06.459 --> 17:07.594
What's going on?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.229
Are you
the Incident Commander?

17:09.262 --> 17:11.098
Me?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.366
Mixed process chemical explosion
at a maraschino cherry factory.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.236
93 casualties,
you're getting 35.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.570
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a drill.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.638
Go.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.772
What the hell?

17:20.807 --> 17:23.343
Did you know
anything about this?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.377
Dr. Lewis!

17:28.448 --> 17:30.850
Uh, Louise is
still asleep.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.353
Yeah, I got some background
information on her.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.687
She lived alone

17:34.721 --> 17:36.823
since her husband died
five or six years ago--

17:36.856 --> 17:38.491
neighbor wasn't sure.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.660
No children,
haven't located any family yet.

17:40.693 --> 17:41.661
I thought
you might want to know.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.298
Yeah, uh... thanks.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.667
I should probably get in there
and check on her.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.837
Yeah, guy uses a similar
pattern each time.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.439
How many other victims?

17:52.472 --> 17:54.674
Four women in the
last five weeks.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.443
He poses as a pizza guy,

17:56.476 --> 17:59.746
pretends to be confused
about the apartment number.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.548
( sighs heavily )

18:01.581 --> 18:03.883
Never open your door to
anyone you don't know.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.886
The others,
are they okay?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.422
Rape isn't quite bad
enough for this guy.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.858
He likes to beat them,
too, like Louise.

18:11.891 --> 18:15.695
One died, and the other three
are in pretty bad shape.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.464
I hope she makes it.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.266
Each victim has
given us a clue,

18:19.299 --> 18:22.502
you know, helped us get
a little bit closer.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.337
If Louise dies...

18:24.371 --> 18:27.240
we'll just have to
wait for the next one.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.808
Got a head lac, GCS 15.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.510
Yeah, she's a green.
Put her in Sutures.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.644
Suture room's full.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.812
Okay, then, Curtain Four.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.481
I want to stay
with Kaitlin.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.648
They said
we could be together.

18:35.682 --> 18:38.251
Sorry, you're a
pelvic fracture,

18:38.285 --> 18:39.652
red tag, Trauma One.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.188
That's not fair.
I want to stay
with Julie.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.589
They promised us
we could go together.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.324
Relax, guys,
you're not babies, all right?

18:44.357 --> 18:45.758
Yeah, but if they were told
they could stay together.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.927
Yeah, they said so.
Yeah, they said so.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.863
Don't forget to call
your consults and support staff.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.533
They're keeping track
of the response... times.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.902
Abby wanted me to tell you
that Social Services is here.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.904
They're in with the Korean
virgin birth girl.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.206
Okay, thanks, Haleh.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.573
Frank, where's Jerry?

19:00.607 --> 19:02.409
He left on account
of the infestation.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.576
He was calling transport

19:03.610 --> 19:05.245
for a real patient
in Two, going to CT.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.579
I'm on it.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.547
Wow, this is fun.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.249
Oh, damn JCAHO drill.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.883
Explosion
at a maraschino cherry factory.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.552
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I mean, come on.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.254
Who makes this stuff up?
I don't know.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.422
Does something like this

19:15.455 --> 19:16.556
even exist in Chicago?
I, actually...

19:16.589 --> 19:17.724
I got rid of two greens

19:17.757 --> 19:19.426
and a merit badge
holder who was dead.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.960
Is it okay to help
a real person

19:20.993 --> 19:22.929
with double vision
and vertigo?
Uh...

19:22.962 --> 19:24.697
Susan, you really want
all the red tags

19:24.731 --> 19:26.533
parked in Trauma One?
No.

19:26.566 --> 19:27.767
Hi, I'm Trina.
I'm a Squad Leader.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.369
Do you need any help?

19:29.402 --> 19:30.370
You've got a head lac.
You can't talk.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.404
I wasn't asking you.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.705
Phone call for you,
Dr. Lewis.

19:32.739 --> 19:36.543
It's the lab.
They want to yell at you.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.779
So Fremont has a pretty good
football team, don't they?

19:39.812 --> 19:42.849
I don't go to that many games.

19:42.882 --> 19:47.254
WENDALL:
What kind of stuff
do you do with your friends?

19:47.287 --> 19:50.557
MI-CHA:
Mostly we just
eat lunch together at school.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.891
LOCKHART:
What about the weekends?

19:51.924 --> 19:56.329
Do you go out as a group
on dates?

19:56.363 --> 19:57.664
Mm, some of my friends

19:57.697 --> 20:00.333
have boyfriends
so they just go with each other.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.635
Do you have a boyfriend?

20:02.669 --> 20:04.504
No.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.006
Can I still leave by 4:00?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.508
Do your parents get very upset

20:08.541 --> 20:09.776
if you're not
home on time?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.778
I have to be there
for my brother.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.945
Why is that?

20:12.979 --> 20:15.248
I take care of him.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.249
How old is he?

20:16.283 --> 20:17.384
Twenty-three.

20:19.852 --> 20:23.556
So you spend a lot of time
with your brother?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.558
Yeah, of course.

20:25.592 --> 20:26.759
And when you
take care of him,

20:26.793 --> 20:28.495
what kind of
things do you do?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.930
I don't know why you keep asking
all these questions.

20:33.833 --> 20:34.801
MI-CHA:
I'm getting tired.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.968
Can I just...

20:36.002 --> 20:37.804
take a nap in here?

20:40.473 --> 20:43.310
Sure, get some rest.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.720
We should check out
this brother.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.522
Mom's in the
Family Room.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.290
I'll try talking to her,
obliquely.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.292
If we have to, we can designate
the baby as a Safe Haven.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.860
Safe Haven?
This baby's not abandoned.

21:00.893 --> 21:01.961
Well, he kind of is.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.396
He's got a mother
right there.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.764
He's got a grandmother
down the hall.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.798
Mi-Cha's not acknowledging
the baby.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.066
Exactly.
In her current state,

21:07.099 --> 21:08.668
she's not competent
to give up the baby.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.036
Yeah, but even if she
does acknowledge him,

21:10.069 --> 21:11.404
we don't know if
she'll want to keep him.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.405
Shouldn't we
at least try for that

21:12.439 --> 21:14.006
before we ship
this kid off?

21:14.040 --> 21:15.342
We don't know anything
about
her family circumstances.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.509
Let's go find out.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.345
You can't break
confidentiality.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.979
Maybe the support of her family
is exactly what this girl needs.

21:20.012 --> 21:20.880
Dr. Carter...

21:20.913 --> 21:22.382
I talked to her mother.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.683
She seems very reasonable,
very concerned.

21:23.716 --> 21:24.651
This baby has a family.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.652
Carter...

21:25.685 --> 21:26.986
Mrs. Pak.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.989
Yes, Mi-Cha-- can I see her now?

21:30.022 --> 21:31.658
Mrs. Pak, have you
noticed any changes

21:31.691 --> 21:33.660
in Mi-Cha's condition
over the last couple months?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.362
No, she's good.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.796
Please tell me
what's wrong with her.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.831
So you didn't know that your
daughter was pregnant?

21:41.534 --> 21:42.569
That's right.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.036
This morning,
she gave birth

21:44.070 --> 21:45.872
to a beautiful,
healthy baby boy.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.010
Her father will not have her
in the house.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.379
Mrs. Pak...

21:52.379 --> 21:53.846
How long will she stay here?

21:53.880 --> 21:54.947
Maybe a couple days.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.386
Mrs. Pak?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.427
She's awake.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.728
Did the Unasyn piggyback
get here yet?

22:08.761 --> 22:10.597
Yeah, I just hung it.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.432
I'll get back to our
little Ranger Scouts.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.766
Yeah, be my guest.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.001
Hey, Louise.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.103
How you doing?

22:20.607 --> 22:22.442
Louise, the man that raped you,

22:22.475 --> 22:26.413
he's raped
four other women.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.780
Now there might be a way

22:27.814 --> 22:30.683
that we could help you
talk to the detective.

22:32.752 --> 22:36.523
The tube that's in your neck

22:36.556 --> 22:40.092
has a little balloon
on the end of it that we inflate

22:40.126 --> 22:43.596
to protect your lungs,
prevent oxygen from leaking out.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.798
If I deflate the balloon

22:45.832 --> 22:48.501
and cover
the end of the tube,

22:48.535 --> 22:49.969
you would be able to whisper.

22:50.002 --> 22:53.606
Just a few words at a time.

22:55.508 --> 22:56.976
There are some very real risks.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.711
I would be
depriving your lungs

22:58.745 --> 23:00.780
of supplemental oxygen
for a minute.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.483
But if there were a problem,

23:03.516 --> 23:07.887
I'd reinflate the balloon
and put you back on the vent.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.693
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

23:16.563 --> 23:18.164
I would need to clear it
with Dr. Kovac,

23:18.197 --> 23:21.768
and I also need your consent.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.778
Hey, Jerry, where's
that surgery consult

23:31.811 --> 23:33.212
on Mr. Rapke in Two?

23:33.245 --> 23:35.615
Oh, man, I have called
them, like, five times,

23:35.648 --> 23:38.050
but they're so jerked around
with these Ranger Scouts,

23:38.084 --> 23:39.586
they won't come down
for something real.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.020
Why don't you go up
and physically

23:41.053 --> 23:42.755
drag one down here
before the guy bleeds out?

23:42.789 --> 23:44.491
As soon as I take these
to the...
No, Jerry, I said now.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.493
Frank, call the lab,
have them come pick that up.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.794
And don't accept any excuses.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.228
Which patient does
Kovac have up at CT?

23:49.261 --> 23:51.664
You have to check the board,
but stay away from Carter.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.165
He's got his panties
in a twist.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.034
Just tell Kovac to come
find me when he gets back.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.836
Did they call yet
about an ICU bed
for Louise Garvin?

23:56.869 --> 23:59.606
They said maybe an hour.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.108
Oh, uh, just wanted
to let you know

24:02.141 --> 24:03.676
that I'll be leaving
for a while.

24:03.710 --> 24:04.644
Louise is awake.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.178
Yeah, I saw her.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.714
I told her I'd see her
later in the afternoon.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.915
Well, she'll
be in ICU then.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.082
I'll find it.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.884
Thanks for your help.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.820
Detective Patrie, wait.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.991
Uh, there is something
else we could try.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.527
So, you knew the
drill was today.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.629
Dr. Lewis? Dr. Lewis,
I'm Trina, remember?

24:22.662 --> 24:23.930
Yes.
I'd still really
like to help.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.231
You know what?
You're a yellow tag.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.933
You should be back
in your area, okay?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.668
Oh, but I feel fine, and I
really think I could be useful.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.669
Oh, well, thanks again.

24:29.702 --> 24:30.937
Malik, could you take Trina back

24:30.970 --> 24:32.238
to the yellow tags?
Yeah, no problem.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.606
Are you sure?
I'm good with injuries.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.674
And I'm a people person.

24:34.707 --> 24:35.875
Yes, anyway,
I knew it was today

24:35.908 --> 24:37.143
because they called
to schedule it.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.645
But you didn't
tell the staff?

24:38.678 --> 24:39.746
I've got a new-onset
scrotal pain,

24:39.779 --> 24:41.047
but we haven't got any rooms.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.214
Can I move the Scouts
out of Exam One?

24:42.248 --> 24:43.215
Yeah, but they still
need to be seen.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.884
Yeah, of course.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.252
Well, I thought it was supposed
to catch us by surprise.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.220
Technically, but a
hint wouldn't hurt.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.056
Susan, you need to
learn to take control,
despite the rules.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.158
Well, I guess I'm gonna need
a little clarification

24:52.191 --> 24:53.960
on which ones to follow
and which ones to break.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.828
What should I do with the Ranger
with the shrapnel injury?

24:55.862 --> 24:57.163
The OR won't let me

24:57.196 --> 24:58.731
through the door.
I'll call them.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.166
MORRIS:
Girls, girls
please, stop.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.968
You-You're gonna get hurt
for real.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.570
Uh, Morris, what the hell
is going on?

25:03.570 --> 25:05.738
Oh, a vat of cherry dye blew up
on this group.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.306
They needed decon.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.642
I couldn't find the key
to the decontamination closet,

25:09.676 --> 25:11.143
so I sent them to the shower.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.145
It was supposed
to be a pretend shower.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.714
Yeah. Go round them up.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.182
Okay, get them some scrubs.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.316
Get them out of
those wet clothes.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.685
Oh, my God.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.186
Susan, this is chaos.
We could use

25:20.219 --> 25:22.922
some help on Curtain Area Four
with the green tags.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.792
Okay, girls, we're gonna...

25:25.825 --> 25:27.093
Girls,

25:27.126 --> 25:29.762
can I have your
attention, please?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.265
Yo, scouts!

25:37.904 --> 25:38.805
That's much better.

25:38.838 --> 25:39.806
Thank you.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.213
Pulse ox 94.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.915
That's good.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.053
Okay, Louise, I'm going
to deflate the balloon now.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.727
You okay, Louise?

26:05.231 --> 26:06.198
( whispers ):
Okay.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.267
Sam was looking for you.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.368
She went off
with that detective.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.270
Okay, thanks.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.673
Luka, can I give
Mr. Sanchez another
four of morphine?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.775
Sure. His chest pain
is getting worse?

26:15.808 --> 26:16.843
Up to seven
out of ten.

26:16.876 --> 26:17.877
Okay. Repeat the EKG.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.278
Already did.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.379
Says the pain
radiates to
his back.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.114
Oh, could be a dissection.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.283
Well, see
if his chest X ray is ready.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.719
Already got it.
It's bedside.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.121
Okay. Better be sure
this guy doesn't need the OR.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.857
PATRIE:
Louise,

26:30.890 --> 26:34.093
you said you got a good look
at this guy's face?

26:34.126 --> 26:36.863
What color was his skin?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.698
( whispers ):
White.

26:38.731 --> 26:39.365
( sniffles )

26:39.398 --> 26:42.168
Was he tall or short?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.904
( gulps, coughs )

26:44.937 --> 26:47.273
( alarm beeping )

26:47.306 --> 26:49.308
All right,
do you want us to stop?

26:49.341 --> 26:51.310
( inhales )

26:54.013 --> 26:55.381
Louise,

26:55.414 --> 26:58.284
was he tall or short?

26:58.317 --> 27:00.820
( gulps )

27:00.853 --> 27:02.822
( whispers ):
Kind of medium.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.126
( whispers ):
Maybe tall.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.361
( sniffles )

27:11.831 --> 27:12.732
Jerry's not back yet?

27:12.765 --> 27:14.701
When is Jerry ever back?

27:14.734 --> 27:16.135
Is this where we
keep the workmen's
comp claim forms?

27:16.168 --> 27:17.704
No, no.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.171
They're in these bins
down here somewhere.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.740
I talked to
Mi-Cha's brother.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.041
He's coming in.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.810
Yeah? How's all that
working out?

27:23.843 --> 27:25.712
Okay. She's opening up
a little bit about her family.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.246
They sound kind of scary.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.948
Meaning what?

27:28.981 --> 27:30.416
Conservative, traditional,
old world,

27:30.449 --> 27:32.151
as in, you'd be pretty screwed

27:32.184 --> 27:34.954
if you were
an unwed teenage mom.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.188
Wendall had to leave
on another case,

27:36.222 --> 27:37.156
but she's coming back.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.224
Do you want to talk to her?

27:38.257 --> 27:39.759
To Mi-Cha?
Again? Why?

27:39.792 --> 27:40.927
I don't know.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.294
I just... figured
whatever helps.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.329
What are these
doing in here?

27:43.362 --> 27:44.430
FRANK
What?

27:44.463 --> 27:45.765
Pictures of Kem
from the computer.

27:45.798 --> 27:46.899
What are they doing
in this drawer?

27:46.933 --> 27:47.900
I really don't know.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.268
Well, somebody printed them out.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.737
You don't have
any idea who?

27:50.737 --> 27:52.104
Well, Morris was looking
at them, but...

27:52.138 --> 27:53.740
Morris? Where is he?

27:53.740 --> 27:55.474
Well, he's wheeling one
of those Scouts up to CT

27:55.507 --> 27:58.077
or something.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.211
CARTER:
Hey, Morris!

27:59.245 --> 28:00.780
Morris, what the hell
are you doing

28:00.813 --> 28:02.114
downloading pictures
of my girlfriend?

28:02.148 --> 28:03.282
What?!

28:03.315 --> 28:04.383
Morris?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.287
( baby cooing )

28:18.530 --> 28:21.500
You should really come
and take a look at him.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.936
Who?

28:23.970 --> 28:26.472
This beautiful baby.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.340
This beautiful boy.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.143
What are you talking about?

28:31.177 --> 28:33.846
You haven't even held him yet,
have you?

28:33.880 --> 28:35.214
Why are you talking like this?

28:35.247 --> 28:37.784
Oh, he is so beautiful.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.187
Look at those eyes.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.022
Look at that face.

28:44.423 --> 28:47.193
And all he wants
to do is be held.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.129
All he wants to
do is be loved.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.297
( baby coos )

28:51.330 --> 28:53.065
Do you know how
lucky you are?

28:53.099 --> 28:54.901
( sighs )

28:54.934 --> 28:57.036
Do you know
what a miracle this is?

29:02.875 --> 29:05.244
What are you doing?

29:05.277 --> 29:06.278
I just don't understand.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.179
Can't you see it?

29:07.213 --> 29:08.247
I mean, look at that.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.248
Here, take him.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.349
Why are you doing this?

29:10.382 --> 29:11.417
Hold him
for a second.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.451
Dr. Carter.

29:14.854 --> 29:17.223
I just thought that maybe
if she-she held the baby for...

29:17.256 --> 29:18.490
They need you down the hall.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.262
( baby cooing )

29:38.310 --> 29:39.378
( quietly ):
I was trying to, uh...

29:39.411 --> 29:40.847
They need you down the hall.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.084
( baby cooing )

29:51.991 --> 29:53.125
I don't remember.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.927
I'm sorry.

29:54.961 --> 29:55.895
( coughs )

29:55.928 --> 29:56.929
PATRIE:
That's okay.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.065
You're doing great, Louise.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.600
Did he have any tattoos
or scars that you saw?

30:01.633 --> 30:02.902
( coughing, alarms beeping )

30:02.935 --> 30:03.970
All right, Louise, I'm going

30:04.003 --> 30:05.371
to blow the
balloon back up.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.173
( coughing and choking,
alarm blaring )

30:07.206 --> 30:09.341
It's okay, Louise. I got you.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.509
What? Is she gonna be okay?

30:10.542 --> 30:11.878
Go get Dr. Kovac now.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.946
KOVAC:
Good news, Mr. Sanchez.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.883
You won't be needing
that surgery after all.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.223
How are her sats?

30:24.256 --> 30:25.257
79. She vomited.

30:25.291 --> 30:28.094
I can see that.

30:28.127 --> 30:29.328
( sighs )

30:29.361 --> 30:31.163
KOVAC:
She's aspirated.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.999
Add five of PEEP,

30:33.032 --> 30:35.334
hang 3.375 of Zosyn
to cover aspiration.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.369
Chest X ray now,
and repeat in an hour.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.604
Is she gonna be okay?

30:38.637 --> 30:40.372
She's sucked vomit
into her lungs.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.574
I don't think there'll be
any more questions today.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.651
You left
her airway vulnerable.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.520
I didn't expect
the vomiting.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.188
Her lungs were
already in bad shape

30:56.222 --> 30:57.489
from the pulmonary contusions.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.490
I wanted to help.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.491
I explained the risks.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.494
It's what Louise wanted.

31:02.528 --> 31:03.963
And what you wanted.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.069
Are you sure no one else knows

31:10.102 --> 31:11.470
about what you were doing
in there?

31:11.503 --> 31:14.240
Just the cop.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.575
Luka, her sats
keep dropping.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.210
( alarms beeping )

31:18.244 --> 31:20.179
Down to 72 on 100% oxygen.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.513
Put her up to ten of PEEP.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.182
MARQUEZ:
Repeat chests.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.516
Bilateral white-out.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.218
Is that the contusions
or the aspiration?

31:26.252 --> 31:28.587
Does it really matter
at this point?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.524
Mi-Cha's brother's here.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.193
Good.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.095
He's 23,
but developmentally delayed.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.396
Wendall's in there
with them.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.231
I'm heading in.
Do you want to come along?

31:39.265 --> 31:42.368
Nope. You and Wendall
can handle it.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.042
Hi.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.078
I'm Dr. Lockhart.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.212
So, Yong-Jo,
you and Mi-Cha

31:53.245 --> 31:54.546
spend a lot of time together?

31:56.415 --> 31:58.284
First, we get up,

31:58.317 --> 31:59.618
and then we have

31:59.651 --> 32:01.553
breakfast,

32:01.587 --> 32:04.690
and then Mi-Cha goes
to school,

32:04.723 --> 32:06.358
and I go to Sadler's.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.094
Sadler's?

32:08.127 --> 32:09.728
It's a supermarket.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.563
YONG-JO:
I stock shelves.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.599
I bag groceries.

32:13.632 --> 32:14.666
I can lift things.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.702
Oh...

32:16.735 --> 32:19.671
So, when Mi-Cha comes home
from school, what do you do?

32:26.412 --> 32:28.147
She... she stays home with me.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.182
She doesn't go out ever.
She never leaves.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.351
Yong-Jo...
She stays
home with me.

32:32.384 --> 32:33.352
What are you doing?

32:33.385 --> 32:34.720
I didn't tell anybody.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.023
Tell anybody about what?

32:40.126 --> 32:42.028
What are you doing here?

32:43.595 --> 32:46.698
I came to see you...
and the baby.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.070
And the baby?

33:10.789 --> 33:13.259
I didn't tell anybody.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.094
You told me not to,
and I didn't.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.728
I promise.

33:19.131 --> 33:21.067
You believe me,
don't you, Mi-Cha?

33:23.735 --> 33:26.605
I didn't do
anything wrong.

33:26.638 --> 33:27.806
Please, Mi-Cha...

33:27.839 --> 33:29.108
Okay, okay, Yong-Jo,

33:29.141 --> 33:30.442
let's go
outside, okay?

33:30.476 --> 33:32.178
I didn't do anything wrong.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.780
I know. It's okay.
I didn't tell anybody!

33:34.813 --> 33:36.782
Come on. We'll go
with you. Come on.

33:36.815 --> 33:40.152
( baby crying )

33:40.186 --> 33:42.088
Mi-Cha?

33:43.589 --> 33:46.125
It's a real
disaster in here.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.460
Red tag, partially
amputated foot.

33:48.494 --> 33:51.163
Another red,
unconscious and
short of breath.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.164
Uh, Trina...

33:52.198 --> 33:53.265
Abdominal lac and dizziness.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.766
She's only a yellow,

33:54.800 --> 33:55.801
but I think she's taken
a turn for the worse.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.336
I can help.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.804
Trina, please,
I-I think we'll be okay.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.172
Hey, Malik,
MALIK:
Yeah?

34:00.206 --> 34:02.174
can you dispo
all these fake patients?

34:02.208 --> 34:05.311
Respiratory distress
needs 02, pulse ox,

34:05.344 --> 34:06.678
chest x-ray
and a possible tube.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.114
Okay, it's
in the works.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.116
Thanks.
SCOUT:
Ow!

34:10.149 --> 34:12.150
Ow! Ow!

34:12.184 --> 34:13.485
What are you doing?

34:13.518 --> 34:15.154
Her foot's amputated.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.722
If we don't put pressure on it,
she'll die.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.290
Trina, please.

34:18.324 --> 34:19.591
You want her to bleed to death?

34:19.625 --> 34:21.293
You want that
on your conscience?

34:21.327 --> 34:25.164
Please, please, Trina,
please get back to your gurney.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.264
But I can help you.

34:26.297 --> 34:27.533
But you're not.
But I can.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.268
I've earned
a lot of badges:

34:29.301 --> 34:30.768
Adventure Club,
Adventure Teen...

34:30.802 --> 34:32.538
Trina...
Globe Trekking, Horse Lover,

34:32.571 --> 34:34.672
Horse Rider, Horse Grooming,
Hiker, Safety Tips,
Trina...

34:34.706 --> 34:36.608
Stress Tips, Sailing, Surfing,
Boating, Bow and Arrow...

34:36.641 --> 34:38.310
Stop it now!

34:38.344 --> 34:40.411
I don't care about
your damn badges.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.552
Water World?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.554
Weather Watch?

34:48.587 --> 34:50.589
You know what?
That's it.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.491
I'm done.
You're all out of here.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.859
Excuse me?

34:53.891 --> 34:57.163
Every observers,
all the little girls, out now!

34:57.163 --> 34:58.164
This drill is over.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.565
You can't do that.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.633
I'm the chief
of Emergency Medicine here,

35:01.667 --> 35:02.734
and I damn well can.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.670
We don't need this drill.

35:04.703 --> 35:08.174
We had a helicopter crash in our
ambulance bay, for God's sake.

35:08.174 --> 35:11.177
So you take your clipboards
and little Ranger Scouts

35:11.210 --> 35:12.811
and move onto some other
sucker hospital,

35:12.844 --> 35:14.680
because my doctors
and my nurses

35:14.713 --> 35:16.482
need to get back to treating
real patients

35:16.515 --> 35:18.184
with real problems--
you got it?

35:22.754 --> 35:23.889
Back to work.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.894
Hey, I was afraid I
was going to miss you.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.262
Uh, yeah, we're
just on our way out.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.198
Yeah, just give
me one second.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.633
Uh, look, you're
going to go up to
the third floor.

35:34.666 --> 35:38.204
Just tell 'em
you're looking for the OR.

35:38.204 --> 35:41.707
What? You're not coming?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.642
Look, just hang out
for about 30 minutes or so,

35:43.675 --> 35:45.644
then roll yourself back down.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.246
How's your dad?

35:47.279 --> 35:49.748
Uh, he came in for a G-tube,
ended up with pneumonia,

35:49.781 --> 35:52.951
but after two weeks
of antibiotics, oxygen,
and chest PT,

35:52.984 --> 35:54.586
he's back to just being old.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.556
( speaking Mandarin )

35:59.925 --> 36:02.261
I just fired all the Scouts.
No more fake patients.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.895
PRATT:
Okay, good, but what about
the ones that we dealt with?

36:03.929 --> 36:05.431
Broom 'em. All of them.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.665
See real patients
only within 15 minutes

36:06.698 --> 36:08.267
of their signing in.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.568
Susan's seems to take
this chief thing

36:09.601 --> 36:11.670
kind of seriously.
Yeah.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.272
I don't know
if it was the
brother wanting

36:13.305 --> 36:15.441
to see the baby
or us thinking

36:15.474 --> 36:16.608
the brother
was the father.

36:16.642 --> 36:17.743
Whatever, it got
through to her.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.611
So, the father was
actually some guy

36:19.645 --> 36:21.380
that lives
across the street?

36:21.413 --> 36:23.382
Yes, her boyfriend...

36:23.415 --> 36:25.417
and her cover was
having Yong-Jo say,

36:25.451 --> 36:27.253
"She never goes out.
She always stays home.

36:27.253 --> 36:30.656
She never leaves me."

36:30.689 --> 36:32.324
Good work.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.725
Thank you.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.329
How are they?

36:37.363 --> 36:39.965
Uh, adjusting, hanging in.
Who knows?

36:39.998 --> 36:41.567
Was that Carter
who was just out here?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.668
Yeah.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.336
I thought he
might come in.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.805
I... think all of this
might've been

36:46.838 --> 36:48.740
a little bit rough on him.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.309
Why? What do you mean?

36:50.342 --> 36:52.311
I don't know if you've heard

36:52.344 --> 36:54.480
what he went through
last spring.

36:54.513 --> 36:55.981
No, I hadn't.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.349
Are you going to come back
to work tomorrow?

36:57.383 --> 36:58.784
Well, that's the plan,

36:58.817 --> 37:00.452
as long as everything's
okay on this end.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.721
( speaking Mandarin )

37:07.793 --> 37:08.760
Shh, shh, shh...

37:08.794 --> 37:10.296
Is he okay?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.298
He just gets confused
and agitated,

37:12.331 --> 37:14.800
and being in the hospital
for that long didn't help.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.468
( speaking Mandarin )

37:16.502 --> 37:18.770
Whoa, Mr. Chen,
Mr. Chen, Mr. Chen,

37:18.804 --> 37:20.472
calm down, calm
down, it's okay.

37:20.506 --> 37:21.940
It's all right.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.475
( groaning ):
Oh, damn it!

37:23.509 --> 37:25.644
( speaking Mandarin )

37:25.677 --> 37:26.578
Son of a bitch!

37:26.612 --> 37:27.546
Son of a bitch.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.947
Bradying down to 42.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.782
Amp of atropine, and
open the crash cart.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.318
What about going up
on the PEEP?

37:32.351 --> 37:33.619
Pressure's too low.
What about steroids?

37:33.652 --> 37:34.953
V-tach, no pulse.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.755
Starting compressions.
Charge to 200.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.757
Milligram of epi.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.559
Charged.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.328
Clear.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.896
No change.
300.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.732
Check for pneumothorax.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.400
Good breath sounds
bilaterally.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.736
No tracheal shift.
Charged.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.737
Clear.

37:53.505 --> 37:55.441
The Ativan's in.
You might not need these.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.909
Send a tech to get
a 28 French Button.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.045
We'll put in a Foley
to keep the tract open.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.680
Shouldn't
I register him first?

38:01.713 --> 38:03.382
No, don't bother.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.983
I'm just going to put
the G-tube in and get him home.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.053
What're you looking
at him for?

38:08.086 --> 38:09.054
He's a second year resident.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.522
I'm an attending.

38:10.556 --> 38:13.925
I said he doesn't need
to be registered.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.894
I'll be back.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.999
He should be in a nursing home.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.668
I'd never do that to him.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.636
Well, at least
you shouldn't have to do this.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.538
Call GI.
Watch his hand.

38:26.572 --> 38:28.374
He may react
when I put in the Foley.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.008
Jing-Mei...

38:30.041 --> 38:32.744
( groaning )
Papa...

38:32.778 --> 38:33.945
Papa!

38:36.815 --> 38:37.849
( sighs ):
Still in fib.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.518
Charge to 360.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.687
I heard she vomited.
Do you think she aspirated?

38:41.720 --> 38:42.788
Clear.

38:44.723 --> 38:47.092
Fine v-fib. Possibly.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.495
Try 360 again.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.997
You shouldn't arrest
from aspiration.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.032
The balloon on her
crike must've burst.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.036
It happens.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.405
Clear.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.441
Asystole.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.442
How long
have you been at it?

39:03.475 --> 39:04.710
39 minutes.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.044
What about a dopamine drip?

39:06.077 --> 39:08.847
No. Hold compressions.

39:10.616 --> 39:12.618
Get a strip. We're done.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.428
I'll clean her up.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.801
She's a coroner's case.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.672
Yeah, I know.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.646
And when they do the autopsy,

39:40.679 --> 39:42.548
they'll see that the balloon
didn't burst.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.499
No.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.803
They'll see that it did.

41:02.928 --> 41:06.197
So, is she going
to keep the baby?

41:06.231 --> 41:09.067
Well, we finally got her
to hold him.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.803
One miracle at a time.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.071
( clears throat )

41:13.104 --> 41:15.741
Look, I just came up
to, uh, apologize.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.579
A few months ago,

41:20.612 --> 41:23.214
the woman that
I'd been with...

41:23.248 --> 41:25.150
we lost a baby.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.184
I heard.

41:28.754 --> 41:30.956
You getting some help
with that?

41:32.624 --> 41:33.859
I'm working on it.

41:38.597 --> 41:39.831
Good night.

41:45.604 --> 41:46.638
( clears throat )

41:58.249 --> 42:01.219
I thought they would've
taken her by now.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.889
Morgue's backed up.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.190
Coroner's backed up.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.893
Same old, same old.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.896
I thought you were with
that intussusception kid.

42:10.929 --> 42:13.999
Pedes surgery
took him up to the OR.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.209
Sam, you don't need to do this.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.911
I know.

42:27.278 --> 42:28.780
There are
other nurses.

42:28.814 --> 42:30.616
I know.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.187
Sam...

42:41.059 --> 42:42.928
I shouldn't have done it.

42:44.029 --> 42:45.864
The contusions were severe.

42:45.897 --> 42:47.232
She could've died anyway.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.002
( sniffles ):
I shouldn't have done it, Luka.

42:51.036 --> 42:53.138
You did what you did
to help the patient, Sam.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.915
Sam...

43:03.949 --> 43:07.352
When I deflated that balloon,
Louise was still so traumatized.

43:13.725 --> 43:15.160
He kept asking her
all these questions,

43:15.193 --> 43:17.996
and the only thing
that she could remember was...

43:18.029 --> 43:21.166
( sniffles )

43:21.199 --> 43:22.934
...white guy, dark hair.

43:33.912 --> 43:37.382
I did what I did
for "White guy, dark hair."

43:37.415 --> 43:38.850
( whispers ):
Come on.
