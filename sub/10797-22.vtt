<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:01.667 --> 00:05.625
<i>Stardate 41601.3.</i>

00:05.667 --> 00:08.000
<i>We are crossing through</i>

00:05.667 --> 00:08.000
<i>the Zed Lapis sector</i>

00:08.041 --> 00:10.542
<i>where we will rendezvous</i>

00:08.041 --> 00:10.542
<i>with Shuttlecraft 13</i>

00:10.583 --> 00:11.917
<i>carrying Deanna Troi</i>

00:11.959 --> 00:13.375
<i>who is returning</i>

00:11.959 --> 00:13.375
<i>from a conference.</i>

00:13.417 --> 00:15.083
<i>Because engineering is involved</i>

00:15.125 --> 00:17.625
<i>in preventive maintenance</i>

00:15.125 --> 00:17.625

00:17.667 --> 00:20.041
<i>we are presently traveling</i>

00:17.667 --> 00:20.041
<i>on impulse power.</i>

00:21.458 --> 00:23.542
Routine deep sensor probes

00:21.458 --> 00:23.542
indicate no obstacles

00:23.583 --> 00:25.667
or vessels within a range

00:23.583 --> 00:25.667
of three light years.

00:25.709 --> 00:26.792
Confirmed.

00:28.166 --> 00:30.333
The martial arts competition

00:28.166 --> 00:30.333
is in three days.

00:30.375 --> 00:32.375
Are you prepared?

00:32.417 --> 00:34.792
I will be if you'll meet me

00:32.417 --> 00:34.792
on the holodeck later.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.083
I need your help

00:36.125 --> 00:38.083
with the Mishiama

00:36.125 --> 00:38.083
wrist-lock and break.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.083
If it works on you

00:39.125 --> 00:41.250
I can use it

00:39.125 --> 00:41.250
on anyone.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.834
A valid assumption.

00:42.875 --> 00:44.709
Who is your

00:42.875 --> 00:44.709
first competitor?

00:44.750 --> 00:47.000
Science Officer Swenson.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.125
You will defeat him easily.

00:49.166 --> 00:50.375
Well, I'm more concerned

00:50.417 --> 00:52.834
with Lieutenant Minnerly's

00:50.417 --> 00:52.834
kick-boxing.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.458
You are favored

00:52.875 --> 00:55.458
in the ship's pool.

00:57.834 --> 00:59.333
You bet on me?

00:59.375 --> 01:00.458
A sure thing.

01:16.375 --> 01:17.417
Thank you,

01:16.375 --> 01:17.417
Lieutenant.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.208
LA FORGE:

01:17.458 --> 01:19.208
Aye, sir.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.834
It'll be good to have

01:19.250 --> 01:21.834
Counselor Troi back,

01:19.250 --> 01:21.834
won't it, Number One?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.083
It certainly will.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.750
WORF:

01:24.125 --> 01:25.750
Sir!

01:25.792 --> 01:28.500
I'm receiving an emergency

01:25.792 --> 01:28.500
transmission from the shuttle.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.667
PICARD:

01:28.542 --> 01:30.667
On main viewer.

01:30.709 --> 01:31.959
I can't, sir.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.500
We're receiving

01:32.000 --> 01:33.500
audio only.

01:33.542 --> 01:34.583
PICARD:

01:33.542 --> 01:34.583
Open the frequency.

01:34.625 --> 01:35.667
Aye, sir.

01:35.709 --> 01:37.083
LIEUTENANT PRIETO:

01:35.709 --> 01:37.083
What a jolt.

01:37.125 --> 01:38.417
Position report?

01:38.458 --> 01:40.417
Sir, I have an onboard

01:38.458 --> 01:40.417
systems failure.

01:40.458 --> 01:41.875
You'll have to tell me

01:40.458 --> 01:41.875
where I am.

01:41.917 --> 01:43.083
I read your coordinates

01:43.125 --> 01:46.083
at three-seven-zero

01:43.125 --> 01:46.083
point two-three-six.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.458
Confirm.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.458
PRIETO:

01:47.500 --> 01:48.458
I can't confirm.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.125
My instruments are haywire.

01:50.166 --> 01:52.875
Lieutenant Prieto,

01:50.166 --> 01:52.875
is Counselor Troi all right?

01:52.917 --> 01:54.291
PRIETO:

01:52.917 --> 01:54.291
Yes, sir.

01:54.333 --> 01:55.709
Just a little shaken.

01:55.750 --> 01:56.875
We're being buffeted a bit.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.417
Losing more power!

02:00.583 --> 02:01.959
My flight control

02:00.583 --> 02:01.959

02:03.750 --> 02:06.041
Leland T. Lynch here, sir.

02:07.917 --> 02:10.166
How long before we can return

02:07.917 --> 02:10.166
to warp power?

02:10.208 --> 02:11.458
Captain, I'm in the middle

02:11.500 --> 02:13.583
of realigning

02:11.500 --> 02:13.583
the dilithium crystals.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.041
PICARD:

02:13.625 --> 02:15.041
There is an emergency.

02:15.083 --> 02:16.125
We need warp drive.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.125
How long?

02:17.166 --> 02:18.250
20 minutes--

02:17.166 --> 02:18.250
maybe more.

02:18.291 --> 02:19.709
We don't have it, Mr. Lynch.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.000
LYNCH:

02:19.750 --> 02:21.000
I'll align it by hand.

02:21.041 --> 02:21.917
Whatever it takes.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.417
LYNCH:

02:21.959 --> 02:23.417
Aye, sir.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.041
Shuttle, this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

02:25.083 --> 02:26.291
Your coordinates now read

02:26.333 --> 02:28.625
two-three-seven

02:26.333 --> 02:28.625
point one-zero-one.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.875
Ben, you're dangerously close

02:28.667 --> 02:30.875
to a planet.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.458
PRIETO:

02:30.917 --> 02:32.458
I can see it.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.500
The planet is Vagra II, sir,

02:32.500 --> 02:35.500
in the Zed Lapis sector.

02:35.542 --> 02:36.959
Uninhabited.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.458
Lieutenant, report.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.083
This is Counselor Troi.

02:40.125 --> 02:41.458
I'll relay, sir.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.458
The pilot is busy.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.834
We've lost most

02:43.500 --> 02:45.834
of our impulse power.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.875
Engineering, status report.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.375
Working on it, Captain.

02:49.417 --> 02:50.750
Three minutes.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.458
But there are no guarantees.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.208
PRIETO:

02:52.500 --> 02:54.208
Captain, we're out of control.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.000
We're caught

02:54.250 --> 02:56.000

COMPUTER:

05:12.959 --> 05:15.125
That procedure

05:51.542 --> 05:53.041
Strange, sir.

05:53.083 --> 05:55.250
There is no emergency signal

05:53.083 --> 05:55.250
from the shuttle as yet.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.458
What is this place, Mr. Data?

05:58.500 --> 06:00.208
There is little information

05:58.500 --> 06:00.208
in the library computer

06:00.250 --> 06:01.917
other than the fact

06:00.250 --> 06:01.917
of its existence.

06:03.583 --> 06:06.291
Our sensors show

06:03.583 --> 06:06.291
no signs of life-forms.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.000
Virtually no vegetation.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.250

06:09.291 --> 06:11.250
Minimum for

06:09.291 --> 06:11.250

Aye, sir,

06:12.458 --> 06:14.000
standard orbit.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.583
I've located

06:23.125 --> 06:24.583
the shuttle.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.750
Life signs?

06:25.792 --> 06:27.125
WORF:

06:25.792 --> 06:27.125
Not yet, sir.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.709
Still probing.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.291
It appears to be buried

06:29.750 --> 06:32.291
under a lot of debris.

06:36.917 --> 06:38.083
I may have something, sir.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.625
Faint life signs.

06:41.667 --> 06:42.709
Very faint.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.041
How many?

06:44.083 --> 06:46.333
There's no way

06:44.083 --> 06:46.333
of telling from here.

06:46.375 --> 06:47.792
Data, can we beam up

06:46.375 --> 06:47.792
the injured?

06:47.834 --> 06:49.041
No, sir.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.792
Our sensors

06:49.083 --> 06:50.792
are not fully penetrating

06:50.834 --> 06:52.083
whatever the debris is.

06:53.792 --> 06:54.834
That's very unusual.

06:54.875 --> 06:55.959
DATA:

06:54.875 --> 06:55.959
Yes, sir.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.166
I cannot

06:56.000 --> 06:57.166
explain.

07:03.125 --> 07:04.500
Number One,

07:03.125 --> 07:04.500
prepare your away team.

07:04.542 --> 07:05.458
Right away.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.625
Data!

07:05.500 --> 07:06.625
Yar!

07:10.250 --> 07:12.125
Dr. Crusher, have you been

07:10.250 --> 07:12.125
monitoring all this?

07:12.166 --> 07:15.250
BEVERLY:

07:12.166 --> 07:15.250
Yes, I'll meet the away team

07:12.166 --> 07:15.250
in Transporter Room Four.

07:49.875 --> 07:50.834
BEVERLY:

07:49.875 --> 07:50.834
Let's go.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.291
The life signs

07:50.875 --> 07:52.291
are weak.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.875
RIKER:

07:58.458 --> 07:59.875
What is this?

07:59.917 --> 08:01.333
No idea.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.041
We'll go around just to

08:01.375 --> 08:03.041
be on the safe side.

08:18.458 --> 08:19.583
Let's try

08:18.458 --> 08:19.583
the other way.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.667
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Riker.

08:34.709 --> 08:35.875
We've got a problem.

08:35.917 --> 08:36.917
What kind of problem,

08:35.917 --> 08:36.917
Number One?

08:36.959 --> 08:38.792
RIKER:

08:36.959 --> 08:38.792
I'm not sure yet.

08:38.834 --> 08:42.125
There appears to be some kind

08:38.834 --> 08:42.125
of a slick blocking our path.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.250
We'll keep you apprised.

08:43.291 --> 08:44.500
Maintain an open frequency.

08:44.542 --> 08:46.000
RIKER:

08:44.542 --> 08:46.000
Aye, sir.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.667
Analysis, Mr. Data.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.333
Inconclusive, sir.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.667
I cannot tell you

08:50.375 --> 08:51.667
what it is

08:51.709 --> 08:54.208
but I can tell you

08:51.709 --> 08:54.208
what it is not.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.208
Explain.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.291
There is no evidence

08:56.333 --> 08:58.333
of neural

08:56.333 --> 08:58.333
or circulatory systems.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.417
No internal

08:58.375 --> 09:00.417
organs.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.625
Cellular structure,

09:00.458 --> 09:02.625
unknown.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.792
Does not have any proteins

09:02.667 --> 09:04.792
which are known to us.

09:04.834 --> 09:05.917
It's narrower over here.

09:05.959 --> 09:07.000
We can get over it.

09:09.959 --> 09:11.792
How is it moving, Data?

09:11.834 --> 09:13.625
I do not

09:11.834 --> 09:13.625
know, sir.

09:13.667 --> 09:14.792
It does not

09:13.667 --> 09:14.792
appear to have

09:14.834 --> 09:17.750
a skeletal framework

09:14.834 --> 09:17.750
or musculature.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.375
Then what's causing it to move?

09:20.792 --> 09:22.709
It appears

09:20.792 --> 09:22.709
to be following us, sir.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.875
No sign

09:22.750 --> 09:23.875
of intelligence--

09:23.917 --> 09:25.041
no brain as we know it--

09:25.083 --> 09:28.000
yet evidence of thought,

09:25.083 --> 09:28.000
Mr. Data?

09:28.041 --> 09:29.750
Insufficient information, sir.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.166
Is it a life-form, Data?

09:33.208 --> 09:36.000
DATA:

09:33.208 --> 09:36.000
Again, insufficient

09:33.208 --> 09:36.000
information, sir.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.125
Theorize.

09:38.625 --> 09:39.875
It is possible.

09:39.917 --> 09:42.709
(<i> rumbling growls</i> )

09:42.750 --> 09:45.083
(<i> deep male voice</i> ):

09:42.750 --> 09:45.083
<i>Very good, tin man.</i>

09:54.375 --> 09:56.125
What is it, Number One?

09:56.166 --> 09:57.250
What are you seeing?

10:02.375 --> 10:03.417
Trouble.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.208
PICARD:

10:10.542 --> 10:12.208
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

10:12.250 --> 10:13.875
<i>While on a mission</i>

10:12.250 --> 10:13.875

10:13.917 --> 10:15.709

10:13.917 --> 10:15.709
<i>shuttle crash</i>

10:15.750 --> 10:18.291
<i>the away team has encountered</i>

10:15.750 --> 10:18.291
<i>a strange creature</i>

10:18.333 --> 10:21.041
<i>which seems able to assume</i>

10:18.333 --> 10:21.041
<i>different forms</i>

10:21.083 --> 10:24.291
<i>including one</i>

10:21.083 --> 10:24.291
<i>which resembles humanoid.</i>

10:24.333 --> 10:26.041
PICARD:

10:24.333 --> 10:26.041
Easy, Number One.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.583
Let's find out what it is

10:26.083 --> 10:27.583
we're dealing with.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.417
RIKER:

10:27.625 --> 10:29.417
Agreed, Captain.

10:29.458 --> 10:33.834
And, Number One, I don't believe

10:29.458 --> 10:33.834
that the location of the crash

10:33.875 --> 10:35.208
and the proximity

10:33.875 --> 10:35.208
of the creature

10:35.250 --> 10:36.583
is a coincidence.

10:48.834 --> 10:51.500
I'm Commander William Riker

10:48.834 --> 10:51.500
of the USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

10:51.542 --> 10:53.583
<i>I am Armus.</i>

10:53.625 --> 10:56.083
<i>Why are you here?</i>

10:56.125 --> 10:57.458
We mean you no harm.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.709
We have injured crewmen

10:57.500 --> 10:59.709
in the shuttlecraft.

10:59.750 --> 11:00.792
We need to get to them.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.333
May we pass?

11:02.375 --> 11:06.291
<i>You haven't given me</i>

11:02.375 --> 11:06.291
<i>a good enough reason.</i>

11:06.333 --> 11:10.166
Preserving life, all life,

11:06.333 --> 11:10.166
is very important to us.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.667
<i>Why?</i>

11:13.667 --> 11:14.959
We believe everything

11:13.667 --> 11:14.959
in the universe

11:15.000 --> 11:16.625
has a right to exist.

11:16.667 --> 11:20.417
<i>An interesting notion</i>

11:16.667 --> 11:20.417
<i>which I do not share.</i>

11:20.458 --> 11:23.125
<i>You may leave</i>

11:20.458 --> 11:23.125
<i>now if you wish.</i>

11:24.417 --> 11:26.166
We are not going

11:24.417 --> 11:26.166
without our shuttle crew.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.625
<i>I warn you.</i>

11:27.667 --> 11:28.834
YAR:

11:27.667 --> 11:28.834
Enough.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.041
We have people

11:28.875 --> 11:31.041
who need attention.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.917
We won't hurt you

11:31.083 --> 11:32.917
but we must help them.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.041
PICARD:

11:46.375 --> 11:48.041
Number One?

11:48.083 --> 11:49.083
The creature attacked us.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.333
Lieutenant Yar is down.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.208
It seems to feed

11:50.375 --> 11:52.208
on our phaser energy.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.458
We had no effect

11:52.250 --> 11:53.458
on it.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.583
PICARD:

12:05.792 --> 12:07.583
What's Lieutenant Yar's

12:05.792 --> 12:07.583
condition?

12:07.625 --> 12:11.000
(<i> instrument beeping rapidly)</i>

12:11.041 --> 12:13.041
PICARD:

12:11.041 --> 12:13.041
Doctor Crusher, report.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.291
She's dead.

12:19.375 --> 12:20.375
Transporter room.

12:20.417 --> 12:21.500
Get them up, now!

12:27.834 --> 12:29.709
I need her in Sick Bay now.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.417
Go to yellow alert,

12:29.750 --> 12:31.417
Lieutenant Worf.

12:31.458 --> 12:32.458
I'll be in Sick Bay.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.542
Aye, sir.

12:41.291 --> 12:42.250
Status, Doctor?

12:42.291 --> 12:43.667
Unchanged.

12:44.959 --> 12:46.166
Can you bring her back?

12:46.208 --> 12:47.250
BEVERLY:

12:46.208 --> 12:47.250
We'll see.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.291
No, I've got her

13:07.250 --> 13:09.291
on total support.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.250
There is no independent

She's not

13:14.667 --> 13:16.000

Let's go for direct

13:27.208 --> 13:29.000
reticular stimulation.

13:29.041 --> 13:29.959
Direct?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.333
Do it.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.583
(<i> electronic zap</i> )

13:38.750 --> 13:40.667

(<i> electronic zap</i> )

14:03.792 --> 14:05.375

She's gone.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.542
Gone?

14:30.959 --> 14:32.333
There was too much

14:30.959 --> 14:32.333
synaptic damage.

14:33.750 --> 14:35.625
That thing just sucked

14:33.750 --> 14:35.625
the life right out of her.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.417
There's nothing I can do.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.083
(<i> communicator not functioning)</i>

15:17.583 --> 15:19.792
<i>Your friends</i>

15:17.583 --> 15:19.792

15:21.000 --> 15:22.750
<i>They're not coming back.</i>

15:23.959 --> 15:25.041
You're wrong.

15:26.417 --> 15:28.583
<i>I killed one of them.</i>

15:30.583 --> 15:31.625
Yes.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.250
I know.

15:34.291 --> 15:36.875
<i>How could you</i>

15:34.291 --> 15:36.875
<i>be in there</i>

15:36.917 --> 15:38.291
<i>and know that?</i>

15:38.333 --> 15:39.792
I felt her die.

15:39.834 --> 15:41.583
<i>Do you want</i>

15:39.834 --> 15:41.583
<i>to know why</i>

15:41.625 --> 15:43.083
<i>I killed her?</i>

15:45.333 --> 15:46.834
Your answer would be

15:45.333 --> 15:46.834
meaningless.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.667
That act had no reason.

15:51.709 --> 15:53.500
<i>Exactly.</i>

15:53.542 --> 15:55.917
<i>It had no meaning.</i>

15:55.959 --> 15:59.250
<i>I did it</i>

15:55.959 --> 15:59.250
<i>because I wanted to.</i>

15:59.291 --> 16:01.667
<i>It amused me.</i>

16:01.709 --> 16:06.375
No, you thought it would

16:01.709 --> 16:06.375
amuse you, but it didn't.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.583
You felt no satisfaction.

16:10.625 --> 16:14.458
<i>No, it was too easy.</i>

16:17.333 --> 16:18.667
You wanted her to suffer.

16:22.083 --> 16:23.792
You have a great need.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.417
<i>I need nothing.</i>

16:25.458 --> 16:26.542
Liar.

16:29.417 --> 16:31.125
End this.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.542
Let us go.

16:32.583 --> 16:34.250
<i>Not yet.</i>

16:34.291 --> 16:36.583
They won't give you

16:34.291 --> 16:36.583
what you want.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.834
<i>And what is that?</i>

16:38.875 --> 16:40.875
To break their spirit.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.208
<i>Oh, is that</i>

16:40.917 --> 16:44.208
<i>what I want?</i>

16:44.250 --> 16:47.166
<i>If breaking their spirit</i>

16:44.250 --> 16:47.166
<i>will amuse me</i>

16:47.208 --> 16:49.750
<i>then that's</i>

16:47.208 --> 16:49.750
<i>what I will have.</i>

16:51.583 --> 16:52.667
Never.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.834
She didn't do anything.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.834
Her phaser was lowered.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.917
LA FORGE:

17:01.875 --> 17:03.917
She only wanted to get to

17:01.875 --> 17:03.917
Troi and Lieutenant Prieto.

17:03.959 --> 17:05.959
RIKER:

17:03.959 --> 17:05.959
There was nothing at all

17:03.959 --> 17:05.959
provocative about what she did.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.667
BEVERLY:

17:06.000 --> 17:07.667
It was a brutal,

17:06.000 --> 17:07.667
senseless act.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.917
Lieutenant Yar's death is

17:10.500 --> 17:12.917
very painful for all of us.

17:12.959 --> 17:14.667
We will have to deal with it

17:12.959 --> 17:14.667
as best we can for now.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.834
Until the shuttle crew is

17:16.250 --> 17:18.834
safely beamed aboard this ship

17:18.875 --> 17:20.041
our feelings will have to wait.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.291
Is that understood?

17:26.166 --> 17:27.250
Lieutenant Worf

17:27.291 --> 17:29.542
you are now acting

17:27.291 --> 17:29.542
Chief of Security.

17:29.583 --> 17:30.875
I will do

17:29.583 --> 17:30.875
my best, sir.

17:32.166 --> 17:34.375
Doctor, what is the state

17:32.166 --> 17:34.375
of the shuttle crew?

17:34.417 --> 17:36.291
We're still receiving

17:34.417 --> 17:36.291
faint life signs

17:36.333 --> 17:38.333
but the sensor readings

17:36.333 --> 17:38.333
are fluctuating.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.041
They may not

17:38.375 --> 17:40.041
be accurate.

17:40.083 --> 17:43.208
Armus is capable of creating

17:40.083 --> 17:43.208
undefined force fields.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.125
In effect, we are powerless

17:43.250 --> 17:45.125
to communicate

17:45.166 --> 17:47.917
or use the transporter

17:45.166 --> 17:47.917
unless it allows it.

17:47.959 --> 17:50.250
A creature against whom

17:47.959 --> 17:50.250
we seem to have no defense.

17:51.625 --> 17:53.125
Number One?

17:53.166 --> 17:55.709
It's down on that planet

17:53.166 --> 17:55.709
waiting for us to come back.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.041
It killed Tasha

17:57.083 --> 17:59.375
and it could have killed us,

17:57.083 --> 17:59.375
but it didn't.

17:59.417 --> 18:02.583
Deanna and Ben are alive

17:59.417 --> 18:02.583
for a reason.

18:02.625 --> 18:05.041
And it knows that we're

18:02.625 --> 18:05.041
not going anywhere

18:05.083 --> 18:06.625
as long as they're

18:05.083 --> 18:06.625
still alive.

18:06.667 --> 18:09.417
Are you saying that its attack

18:06.667 --> 18:09.417
on Yar was not arbitrary

18:09.458 --> 18:10.709
but part of some tactic?

18:10.750 --> 18:13.000
The only way to find out

18:10.750 --> 18:13.000
is to go back down.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.166
Commander, I may be able to see

18:13.041 --> 18:15.166
something in the creature

18:15.208 --> 18:16.458
which might be helpful.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.625
Agreed.

18:17.667 --> 18:18.875
Prepare your away team,

18:17.667 --> 18:18.875
Number One.

18:23.583 --> 18:24.625
Lieutenant Worf?

18:30.333 --> 18:32.333
I will remain

18:30.333 --> 18:32.333
on the ship.

18:32.375 --> 18:34.291
WORF:

18:32.375 --> 18:34.291
The object here

18:32.375 --> 18:34.291
is not to engage

18:34.333 --> 18:35.917
the creature

18:34.333 --> 18:35.917
in battle.

18:35.959 --> 18:37.834
The goal

18:35.959 --> 18:37.834
is the safe return

18:37.875 --> 18:39.500
of Counselor Troi

18:37.875 --> 18:39.500
and Lieutenant Prieto.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.917
I can best accomplish this

18:40.875 --> 18:42.917
at the tactical station.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.709
Very good.

18:45.750 --> 18:46.792
Number One.

19:07.625 --> 19:08.959
<i>Enterprise.</i>

19:09.000 --> 19:10.500
PICARD:

19:09.000 --> 19:10.500
Number One.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.875
We're approaching

19:10.542 --> 19:11.875
the shuttlecraft.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.333
The creature

19:11.917 --> 19:13.333
is covering it.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.709
ARMUS:

19:15.583 --> 19:17.709
<i>I lied to you.</i>

19:17.750 --> 19:19.333
<i>They came back.</i>

19:20.709 --> 19:22.208
Let me talk with them.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.625
<i>No.</i>

19:23.667 --> 19:24.917
Why?

19:24.959 --> 19:26.333
Does the thought

19:26.375 --> 19:29.208
of my having contact with them

19:26.375 --> 19:29.208
make you uneasy?

19:29.250 --> 19:33.250
<i>No, not being able</i>

19:29.250 --> 19:33.250
<i>to contact</i> you--

19:33.291 --> 19:36.125
<i>not knowing</i>

19:33.291 --> 19:36.125
<i>if you are alive--</i>

19:36.166 --> 19:38.625
<i>makes them uneasy.</i>

19:38.667 --> 19:41.375
<i>Can't you feel</i>

19:38.667 --> 19:41.375
<i>how worried they are?</i>

19:41.417 --> 19:42.625
Yes.

19:44.208 --> 19:45.834
Yes, they are worried.

19:45.875 --> 19:47.667
<i>They care for you.</i>

19:47.709 --> 19:50.792
<i>You must be</i>

19:47.709 --> 19:50.792
<i>very special.</i>

19:50.834 --> 19:53.125
We are members of a community.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.291
We all care for one another.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.542
<i>Equally?</i>

19:57.834 --> 19:59.917
You were really surprised

19:57.834 --> 19:59.917
they came back.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.625
<i>Yes.</i>

20:01.667 --> 20:02.959
Why?

20:04.125 --> 20:05.542
Because the others did not?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.583
<i>What others?</i>

20:09.917 --> 20:12.083
You can't hide

20:09.917 --> 20:12.083
the emptiness from me.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.709
The others.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.000
The ones who hurt you.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.834
Who left you alone, rejected.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.834
The ones who make you so angry.

20:25.375 --> 20:28.291
<i>What do you</i>

20:25.375 --> 20:28.291
<i>know of them?</i>

20:28.333 --> 20:29.959
Only what you tell me.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.959
<i>I will tell you</i>

20:30.000 --> 20:31.959
<i>nothing.</i>

20:33.625 --> 20:34.750
Not now...

20:36.250 --> 20:37.333
but soon.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.875
Captain, look at this.

20:52.041 --> 20:53.625
The force

20:52.041 --> 20:53.625
of the energy field

20:53.667 --> 20:55.667
around the shuttlecraft

20:53.667 --> 20:55.667
decreased for a few moments

20:55.709 --> 20:57.709
when the creature

20:55.709 --> 20:57.709
was draped over it.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.625
PICARD:

20:57.750 --> 20:59.625
But not low enough

20:57.750 --> 20:59.625
to beam them out.

20:59.667 --> 21:00.834
Almost.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.875
It's approaching

21:00.875 --> 21:02.875
the away team now

21:02.917 --> 21:04.458
and the energy field

21:02.917 --> 21:04.458
over the shuttlecraft

21:04.500 --> 21:06.208
is back to

21:04.500 --> 21:06.208
full intensity.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.458
Chart it.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.458
I want to see

21:07.500 --> 21:08.458
if there's a pattern.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.583
Aye, sir.

21:20.208 --> 21:22.208
<i>She said you'd be back.</i>

21:24.250 --> 21:25.458
Then she is alive.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.291
<i>For now.</i>

21:27.333 --> 21:29.166
<i>Why have you</i>

21:27.333 --> 21:29.166
<i>returned?</i>

21:29.208 --> 21:30.417
We have no choice.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.000
We're here to negotiate

21:30.458 --> 21:32.000
for our team.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.583
What do you want?

21:33.625 --> 21:36.083
<i>Maybe I want nothing.</i>

21:36.125 --> 21:37.625
RIKER:

21:36.125 --> 21:37.625
Then you would

21:36.125 --> 21:37.625
have killed all of us.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.792
Armus:

21:37.667 --> 21:39.792
<i>I still might.</i>

21:39.834 --> 21:40.875
RIKER:

21:39.834 --> 21:40.875
What do you want?

21:40.917 --> 21:42.041
Tell me.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.125
Maybe we can reach

21:42.083 --> 21:44.125
an accommodation.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.959
<i>If I tell you, will</i>

21:44.166 --> 21:46.959
<i>you give it to me?</i>

21:47.000 --> 21:47.959
I might.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.458
It depends.

21:50.792 --> 21:52.458
I am a doctor.

21:52.500 --> 21:55.333
I need to treat

21:52.500 --> 21:55.333
our injured friends.

21:55.375 --> 21:56.792
<i>Say, "please."</i>

21:59.125 --> 22:00.500
Please.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.500
<i>You ask nicely.</i>

22:02.542 --> 22:04.291
<i>I will allow it.</i>

22:05.583 --> 22:06.959
<i>Wait!</i>

22:07.000 --> 22:09.083
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

22:09.125 --> 22:11.500
<i>Talk to her</i>

22:09.125 --> 22:11.500
<i>from here.</i>

22:11.542 --> 22:13.000
How...

22:14.875 --> 22:16.542
Troi, can you hear me?

22:19.125 --> 22:21.083
BEVERLY:

22:19.125 --> 22:21.083
Deanna, are you all right?

22:23.625 --> 22:25.041
Beverly?

22:25.083 --> 22:26.208
TROI:

22:25.083 --> 22:26.208
I can hear you.

22:27.959 --> 22:29.083
Are you all right?

22:30.750 --> 22:32.542
Yes.

22:32.583 --> 22:35.166
We've encountered

22:32.583 --> 22:35.166
some difficulty.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.709
I know.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.500
She needs our help.

22:40.542 --> 22:42.000
<i>So what?</i>

22:43.333 --> 22:45.500
Our friends are suffering

22:43.333 --> 22:45.500
a few meters away

22:45.542 --> 22:46.875
yet you block our path.

22:46.917 --> 22:48.041
Why?

22:48.083 --> 22:51.542
<i>You are all ungrateful.</i>

22:51.583 --> 22:53.166
BEVERLY:

22:51.583 --> 22:53.166
What is he

22:51.583 --> 22:53.166
made of?

22:53.208 --> 22:55.166
DATA:

22:53.208 --> 22:55.166
It did not register

22:53.208 --> 22:55.166
on the tricorder.

22:55.208 --> 22:59.208
<i>"It?" Does that mean</i>

22:55.208 --> 22:59.208
<i>I am not alive?</i>

22:59.250 --> 23:01.834
No, clearly you

22:59.250 --> 23:01.834
are some kind

23:01.875 --> 23:03.667
of intelligent form.

23:03.709 --> 23:08.291
<i>But you said</i>

23:03.709 --> 23:08.291
<i>I did not register</i>

23:03.709 --> 23:08.291
<i>on your instrument.</i>

23:08.333 --> 23:11.208
<i>Perhaps your instruments</i>

23:08.333 --> 23:11.208
<i>are useless.</i>

23:21.333 --> 23:23.041
<i>Don't help him.</i>

23:23.083 --> 23:24.125
Data.

23:29.458 --> 23:30.792
Half meter

23:29.458 --> 23:30.792
to the right, Geordi.

23:35.875 --> 23:37.458
<i>Aren't you going</i>

23:35.875 --> 23:37.458
<i>to lead him</i>

23:37.500 --> 23:40.542
<i>to his sight again, robot?</i>

23:40.583 --> 23:43.041
No, you will just move it again

23:43.083 --> 23:44.333
and I will not help you

23:43.083 --> 23:44.333
hurt him.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.041
<i>Then give it to him.</i>

23:47.083 --> 23:49.875
<i>I will find</i>

23:47.083 --> 23:49.875
<i>something else</i>

23:47.083 --> 23:49.875
<i>to amuse me.</i>

24:05.792 --> 24:08.750
<i>You said they</i>

24:05.792 --> 24:08.750
<i>wouldn't amuse me.</i>

24:08.792 --> 24:11.000
<i>You were right.</i>

24:11.041 --> 24:12.542
And the emptiness remains.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.166
You sound so alone.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.083
<i>I am alone.</i>

24:23.291 --> 24:24.583
Abandoned.

24:26.542 --> 24:28.667
Who deserted you?

24:28.709 --> 24:32.250
<i>Creatures whose beauty</i>

24:28.709 --> 24:32.250
<i>now dazzles all who see them.</i>

24:33.417 --> 24:36.250
<i>They would not exist</i>

24:33.417 --> 24:36.250
<i>without me.</i>

24:38.500 --> 24:40.166
You were together.

24:40.208 --> 24:43.458
<i>They perfected a means</i>

24:40.208 --> 24:43.458
<i>of bringing to the surface</i>

24:43.500 --> 24:46.792
<i>all that was evil</i>

24:43.500 --> 24:46.792
<i>and negative within...</i>

24:46.834 --> 24:50.000
<i>erupting, spreading,</i>

24:46.834 --> 24:50.000
<i>connecting.</i>

24:50.041 --> 24:53.125
<i>In time, it formed</i>

24:50.041 --> 24:53.125
<i>a second skin--</i>

24:53.166 --> 24:55.041
<i>dank and vile.</i>

24:57.000 --> 24:58.333
You.

24:58.375 --> 24:59.458
<i>Yes.</i>

25:02.709 --> 25:04.583
They discarded you and left.

25:06.125 --> 25:07.709
<i>And here I am.</i>

25:11.542 --> 25:12.625
You have my pity.

25:15.834 --> 25:18.000
(<i> rumbling growls</i> )

25:20.000 --> 25:21.875
<i>Your pity?</i>

25:21.917 --> 25:23.834
<i>Save that for yourself!</i>

25:34.125 --> 25:35.834
(<i> no audio</i> )

25:39.542 --> 25:40.917
Data!

25:40.959 --> 25:43.000
Data, something's got me!

25:43.041 --> 25:44.917
ARMUS:

25:43.041 --> 25:44.917
<i>Touch him, and he dies.</i>

25:44.959 --> 25:45.875
No!

25:45.917 --> 25:47.291
No, don't!

25:57.875 --> 25:59.208
<i>Enterprise.</i>

25:59.250 --> 26:02.750
Armus has... enveloped

25:59.250 --> 26:02.750
Commander Riker.

26:02.792 --> 26:04.041
I'm beaming you up.

26:04.083 --> 26:07.917
<i>If any of you leave now,</i>

26:04.083 --> 26:07.917
<i>he dies.</i>

26:07.959 --> 26:10.709
<i>And so do the survivors</i>

26:07.959 --> 26:10.709
<i>of the crash.</i>

26:30.458 --> 26:32.125
PICARD:

26:30.458 --> 26:32.125
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

26:32.166 --> 26:35.000
<i>There is grave danger</i>

26:32.166 --> 26:35.000
<i>to the crew on Vagra II.</i>

26:35.041 --> 26:36.458
<i>My first officer is missing--</i>

26:36.500 --> 26:39.000
<i>attacked by this entity</i>

26:36.500 --> 26:39.000
<i>known as Armus.</i>

26:40.917 --> 26:42.792
Captain, perhaps you

26:40.917 --> 26:42.792
should take a look at this.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.291
WORF:

26:44.792 --> 26:46.291
We have the chart

26:44.792 --> 26:46.291
of the energy field

26:46.333 --> 26:47.750
surrounding the shuttle.

26:47.792 --> 26:49.250
There are a lot

26:47.792 --> 26:49.250
of fluctuations.

26:49.291 --> 26:51.458
Yes, but there<i> is</i>

26:49.291 --> 26:51.458
a pattern.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.166
Here is where it killed

26:51.500 --> 26:54.166
Lieutenant Yar

26:54.208 --> 26:56.750
and here is where it

26:54.208 --> 26:56.750
absorbed Commander Riker.

26:56.792 --> 27:00.166
And here, here, where

26:56.792 --> 27:00.166
the energy is lowest?

27:00.208 --> 27:02.458
Both times, it had

27:00.208 --> 27:02.458
enveloped the shuttle.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.875
It has something to do

27:05.041 --> 27:06.875
with Counselor Troi.

27:08.250 --> 27:10.458
PICARD:

27:08.250 --> 27:10.458
Somehow, when it's

27:08.250 --> 27:10.458
dealing with her

27:10.500 --> 27:12.458
the energy field

27:10.500 --> 27:12.458
is affected.

27:12.500 --> 27:13.667
I want to talk to her.

27:13.709 --> 27:14.792
I'm going to beam down.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.125
Lieutenant Worf,

27:14.834 --> 27:16.125
you have the conn.

27:20.208 --> 27:21.417
TROI:

27:20.208 --> 27:21.417
Imzadi!

27:21.458 --> 27:24.041
No, please stop hurting him.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.125
ARMUS:

27:25.333 --> 27:27.125
<i>He resists.</i>

27:27.166 --> 27:31.208
<i>If he would give himself over,</i>

27:27.166 --> 27:31.208
<i>the pain would diminish.</i>

27:32.417 --> 27:33.709
<i>He struggles.</i>

27:33.750 --> 27:35.917
<i>You should feel</i>

27:33.750 --> 27:35.917
<i>his strength.</i>

27:37.625 --> 27:39.542
I can.

27:39.583 --> 27:42.041
<i>Should I let him go?</i>

27:42.083 --> 27:44.583
You only ask to torment me.

27:44.625 --> 27:46.375
<i>Perhaps.</i>

27:46.417 --> 27:48.542
How should I answer?

27:48.583 --> 27:51.333
What can I offer except myself?

27:51.375 --> 27:53.709
<i>And would you give</i>

27:51.375 --> 27:53.709
<i>yourself for him?</i>

27:54.750 --> 27:57.500
<i>Would you give</i>

27:54.750 --> 27:57.500
<i>that much?</i>

27:57.542 --> 28:00.291
Yes, without hesitation.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.959
<i>Just for him?</i>

28:04.000 --> 28:06.250
No, not just for him.

28:06.291 --> 28:08.458
I would do the same

28:06.291 --> 28:08.458
for any of the others.

28:10.834 --> 28:13.375
Armus, you have me.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.291
Let them go.

28:16.333 --> 28:20.375
<i>Perhaps...</i>

28:16.333 --> 28:20.375
<i>Ah, another has arrived.</i>

28:38.458 --> 28:40.750
<i>You are the one in charge?</i>

28:43.500 --> 28:45.000
Is Commander Riker alive?

28:45.041 --> 28:47.250
<i>Answer, tin man.</i>

28:47.291 --> 28:50.750
I would guess that death

28:47.291 --> 28:50.750
is no longer sufficient

28:50.792 --> 28:52.333
to alleviate

28:50.792 --> 28:52.333
its boredom.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.041
Therefore, Commander

28:52.375 --> 28:54.041
Riker is alive.

28:55.208 --> 28:56.291
<i>Maybe.</i>

29:05.291 --> 29:08.333
<i>Don't you want to ask me</i>

29:05.291 --> 29:08.333
<i>what I want?</i>

29:09.667 --> 29:11.041
No.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.500
<i>Not even to protect</i>

29:11.083 --> 29:14.500
<i>your own existence?</i>

29:20.500 --> 29:22.166
I want to see my people

29:20.500 --> 29:22.166
in the shuttle.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.917
<i>Entertain me.</i>

29:26.458 --> 29:28.041
Hm-mm.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.250
<i>Then I will do it myself.</i>

29:41.709 --> 29:43.083
<i>You, tin man--</i>

29:48.333 --> 29:50.333
<i>Now, tell me,</i>

29:48.333 --> 29:50.333
<i>how would you feel</i>

29:50.375 --> 29:51.792
<i>if</i> you<i> were</i>

29:50.375 --> 29:51.792
<i>the instrument</i>

29:51.834 --> 29:53.834
<i>of death</i>

29:51.834 --> 29:53.834
<i>for your leader?</i>

29:53.875 --> 29:55.417
Don't struggle, Data.

29:55.458 --> 29:58.583
I have no control over

29:55.458 --> 29:58.583
what you do with the phaser.

29:58.625 --> 30:01.583
Therefore, I would not be

29:58.625 --> 30:01.583
the instrument of his death.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.458
<i>Perhaps killing the doctor</i>

30:03.500 --> 30:05.542
<i>would engender</i>

30:03.500 --> 30:05.542
<i>more feeling.</i>

30:07.458 --> 30:10.583
No, the control

30:07.458 --> 30:10.583
is still yours.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.500
<i>And what about</i>

30:10.625 --> 30:13.500
<i>you, Doctor?</i>

30:13.542 --> 30:15.709
<i>Are you ready to die?</i>

30:15.750 --> 30:18.583
<i>Tell me you are</i>

30:15.750 --> 30:18.583
<i>not afraid.</i>

30:18.625 --> 30:20.166
I am afraid.

30:20.208 --> 30:22.041
<i>Beg me to</i>

30:20.208 --> 30:22.041
<i>spare you.</i>

30:22.083 --> 30:23.166
No.

30:24.458 --> 30:26.166
<i>One of you is going to die.</i>

30:27.333 --> 30:29.333
<i>And you, Doctor, get to choose.</i>

30:30.417 --> 30:32.917
<i>You don't like that,</i>

30:30.417 --> 30:32.917
<i>do you?</i>

30:32.959 --> 30:35.291
Then I choose myself.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.709
<i>No.</i>

30:36.750 --> 30:38.917
<i>You are going to live.</i>

30:38.959 --> 30:40.959
<i>One of them dies.</i>

30:44.291 --> 30:46.000
<i>Maybe this one.</i>

30:46.041 --> 30:48.375
<i>Though I would not</i>

30:46.041 --> 30:48.375
<i>call it death</i>

30:48.417 --> 30:50.625
<i>since he is only a device.</i>

30:50.667 --> 30:52.250
<i>Tell me,</i>

30:50.667 --> 30:52.250
<i>tin man</i>

30:52.291 --> 30:53.583
<i>how does</i>

30:52.291 --> 30:53.583
<i>it feel</i>

30:53.625 --> 30:55.291
<i>to face your</i>

30:53.625 --> 30:55.291
<i>own extinction?</i>

30:56.834 --> 30:58.166
Curious.

30:58.208 --> 30:59.417
(<i> phaser drops to the ground)</i>

31:03.333 --> 31:05.750
You are capable

31:03.333 --> 31:05.750
of great sadism and cruelty.

31:07.125 --> 31:08.959
Interesting--

31:09.000 --> 31:10.875
no redeeming qualities.

31:10.917 --> 31:13.250
<i>So what do you think?</i>

31:13.291 --> 31:15.125
I think you should be destroyed.

31:15.166 --> 31:18.333
<i>A moral judgment</i>

31:15.166 --> 31:18.333
<i>from a machine?</i>

31:18.375 --> 31:20.291
Data.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.834
Armus, we are finished

31:20.333 --> 31:22.834
dealing with you.

31:22.875 --> 31:26.667
<i>I have your man in here</i>

31:22.875 --> 31:26.667
<i>and the others in the shuttle.</i>

31:26.709 --> 31:27.959
It doesn't matter.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.083
We will no longer be

31:28.000 --> 31:30.083
a source of amusement.

31:30.125 --> 31:32.250
<i>I can kill them.</i>

31:32.291 --> 31:33.875
Yes, you can

31:33.917 --> 31:35.291
but only I can command them.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.000
They follow my orders.

31:37.041 --> 31:39.000
<i>Have them amuse me.</i>

31:39.041 --> 31:41.375
Only if you will let me see

31:39.041 --> 31:41.375
my people on the shuttle first.

31:41.417 --> 31:42.333
I must see them.

31:42.375 --> 31:43.917
<i>Not possible.</i>

31:45.291 --> 31:47.125
Then our business with you

31:45.291 --> 31:47.125
is concluded.

31:47.166 --> 31:50.125
<i>And you claim you care</i>

31:47.166 --> 31:50.125
<i>about your comrades.</i>

31:51.375 --> 31:52.625
I care.

31:52.667 --> 31:54.166
Which is why

31:52.667 --> 31:54.166
I must see them.

31:55.333 --> 31:57.041
<i>You want to see your people?</i>

32:03.542 --> 32:04.875
<i>Then here.</i>

32:06.208 --> 32:07.417
<i>Look...</i>

32:08.625 --> 32:10.166
<i>at this one.</i>

32:15.208 --> 32:17.250
BEVERLY:

32:15.208 --> 32:17.250
He's alive.

32:17.291 --> 32:18.792
(<i> gulping and gasping</i> )

32:18.834 --> 32:20.333
Don't move.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.667
PICARD:

32:23.125 --> 32:24.667
Is he

32:23.125 --> 32:24.667
all right?

32:24.709 --> 32:26.333
All signs

32:24.709 --> 32:26.333
show normal.

32:27.667 --> 32:28.959
RIKER:

32:27.667 --> 32:28.959
So much

32:27.667 --> 32:28.959
frustration

32:29.000 --> 32:30.208
it had to get

32:29.000 --> 32:30.208
rid of me.

32:36.458 --> 32:37.959
Now, let me see the others.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.750
<i>No.</i>

32:40.792 --> 32:43.667
I will not allow my people

32:40.792 --> 32:43.667
to entertain you until you do.

32:43.709 --> 32:46.959
<i>They are incapable</i>

32:43.709 --> 32:46.959
<i>of entertaining me.</i>

32:48.834 --> 32:50.500
PICARD:

32:48.834 --> 32:50.500
I want the four

32:48.834 --> 32:50.500
of you out of here.

32:50.542 --> 32:53.000
<i>Enterprise,</i> beam

32:50.542 --> 32:53.000
up the away team

32:50.542 --> 32:53.000
immediately.

32:53.041 --> 32:54.250
WORF:

32:53.041 --> 32:54.250
Aye, sir.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

32:58.208 --> 32:59.667
They're no longer involved.

32:59.709 --> 33:01.542
This is between you and me.

33:01.583 --> 33:03.125
<i>They may leave.</i>

33:20.083 --> 33:21.333
Now...

33:21.375 --> 33:23.667
<i>I want to leave</i>

33:21.375 --> 33:23.667
<i>this place.</i>

33:26.709 --> 33:28.583
You want me to give

33:26.709 --> 33:28.583
you transportation?

33:30.166 --> 33:31.166
<i>For which</i>

33:31.208 --> 33:33.417
<i>I will trade you lives.</i>

33:33.458 --> 33:35.583
I must see my people

33:33.458 --> 33:35.583
in the shuttle.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.000
<i>Will you give me</i>

33:37.041 --> 33:38.417
<i>what I want?</i>

33:40.458 --> 33:42.417
I have the means

33:42.458 --> 33:43.959
but, first,

33:42.458 --> 33:43.959
I must see my people.

33:45.625 --> 33:47.000
<i>If you must.</i>

33:55.792 --> 33:57.875
Troi, are you

33:55.792 --> 33:57.875
all right?

33:57.917 --> 33:59.750
Yes, but Ben

33:57.917 --> 33:59.750
is not.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.291
He's alive.

34:09.417 --> 34:10.917
Were you able to help Tasha?

34:15.625 --> 34:16.667
No.

34:20.917 --> 34:22.125
Troi...

34:23.417 --> 34:25.917
Troi, we must talk.

34:25.959 --> 34:27.208
I believe

34:25.959 --> 34:27.208
it's possible

34:27.250 --> 34:28.583
to outmaneuver

34:27.250 --> 34:28.583
this creature

34:28.625 --> 34:30.625
and beam you and Ben

34:28.625 --> 34:30.625
back up to the ship.

34:30.667 --> 34:31.959
We've been monitoring

34:32.000 --> 34:34.041
the energy field

34:32.000 --> 34:34.041
that surrounds the shuttle.

34:34.083 --> 34:36.875
When the creature is here,

34:34.083 --> 34:36.875
the field weakens.

34:38.458 --> 34:39.500
Do you know why?

34:40.625 --> 34:42.750
The creature

34:40.625 --> 34:42.750
is filled with rage--

34:42.792 --> 34:46.041
undirected, unfocused rage.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.000
When he confronts it,

34:46.083 --> 34:49.000
his guard goes down

34:49.041 --> 34:52.208
because he's feeling it

34:49.041 --> 34:52.208
instead of suppressing it.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.333
Acknowledging his needs

34:54.375 --> 34:56.291
makes him

34:54.375 --> 34:56.291
vulnerable.

34:56.333 --> 34:57.667
What caused the rage?

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
He was left here--

35:01.041 --> 35:02.125
abandoned.

35:11.041 --> 35:12.583
WORF:

35:11.041 --> 35:12.583
The force field

35:11.041 --> 35:12.583
will have to drop

35:12.625 --> 35:14.458
below 2.7 before

35:12.625 --> 35:14.458
we can beam them up.

35:17.750 --> 35:19.458
<i>Satisfied?</i>

35:19.500 --> 35:21.000
Yes.

35:21.041 --> 35:23.166
<i>Then, can we leave?</i>

35:23.208 --> 35:24.625
Where do you

35:23.208 --> 35:24.625
want to go?

35:24.667 --> 35:26.250
Do you want to try to find

35:24.667 --> 35:26.250
those who left you here?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.375
<i>She told you</i>

35:27.375 --> 35:29.375
<i>about them!</i>

35:37.291 --> 35:38.583
How long have

35:37.291 --> 35:38.583
you been here?

35:39.792 --> 35:41.750
<i>Since they left--</i>

35:41.792 --> 35:44.083
<i>a very long time.</i>

35:44.125 --> 35:45.542
A long time to be alone.

35:45.583 --> 35:47.291
<i>Save your</i>

35:45.583 --> 35:47.291
<i>compassion.</i>

35:47.333 --> 35:49.083
<i>It's revolting.</i>

35:49.125 --> 35:53.542
<i>You offer it like a prize</i>

35:49.125 --> 35:53.542
<i>when, in fact, it's an insult.</i>

35:53.583 --> 35:55.250
Because you feel unworthy.

35:55.291 --> 35:57.417
<i>You overrate</i>

35:55.291 --> 35:57.417
<i>your gift.</i>

35:57.458 --> 36:01.750
<i>You humans are puny--</i>

35:57.458 --> 36:01.750
<i>weak.</i>

36:01.792 --> 36:03.709
But our spirit is indomitable.

36:03.750 --> 36:07.166
<i>And still, you die</i>

36:03.750 --> 36:07.166
<i>from a flick of my power.</i>

36:09.333 --> 36:11.625
A great poet once said

36:11.667 --> 36:14.333
"All spirits are enslaved

36:11.667 --> 36:14.333
that serve things evil."

36:15.834 --> 36:18.000
<i>You do not understand.</i>

36:18.041 --> 36:20.458
<i>I do not serve things evil--</i>

36:20.500 --> 36:22.125
<i>I</i> am<i> evil.</i>

36:23.750 --> 36:26.458
Oh, no, you are not.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.291
<i>I am a skin of evil</i>

36:28.333 --> 36:31.792
<i>left here by a race</i>

36:28.333 --> 36:31.792
<i>of titans who believed</i>

36:31.834 --> 36:34.917
<i>if they rid themselves of me,</i>

36:31.834 --> 36:34.917
<i>they would free</i>

36:34.959 --> 36:37.834
<i>the bonds of</i>

36:34.959 --> 36:37.834
<i>destructiveness.</i>

36:37.875 --> 36:39.583
Yes, so here you are.

36:41.166 --> 36:44.417
Feeding on your own loneliness,

36:41.166 --> 36:44.417
consumed by your own pain

36:44.458 --> 36:46.291
believing

36:44.458 --> 36:46.291
your own lies.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.625
Set the computer.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.875
When the energy level

36:47.667 --> 36:50.875
reaches 2.6.205

36:50.917 --> 36:53.125
automatically beam up

36:50.917 --> 36:53.125
Troi and Prieto.

36:53.166 --> 36:55.041
We'll do a parallel

36:53.166 --> 36:55.041
transport on the captain.

36:55.083 --> 36:56.250
Yes, sir.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.041
You say you

36:57.625 --> 36:59.041
are true evil?

37:00.375 --> 37:02.542
Shall I tell you

37:00.375 --> 37:02.542
what true evil is?

37:03.834 --> 37:05.625
It is to submit

37:03.834 --> 37:05.625
to you.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.417
It's when

37:05.667 --> 37:07.417
we surrender

37:05.667 --> 37:07.417
our freedom--

37:07.458 --> 37:08.458
our dignity--

37:08.500 --> 37:09.709
instead of defying you.

37:09.750 --> 37:13.083
<i>I will kill you</i>

37:09.750 --> 37:13.083
<i>and those in there!</i>

37:13.125 --> 37:15.709
But you will still be here...

37:15.750 --> 37:17.375
in this place.

37:17.417 --> 37:18.333
Forever.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.333
Alone.

37:19.375 --> 37:20.291
Immortal.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.333
(<i> gasping and growling</i> )

37:23.750 --> 37:25.792
WORF:

37:23.750 --> 37:25.792
Stand by for

37:23.750 --> 37:25.792
parallel transport.

37:25.834 --> 37:29.125
The energy level

37:25.834 --> 37:29.125
has dropped to 2.6.3.

37:29.166 --> 37:31.625
That's your real fear--

37:31.667 --> 37:33.250
never to die.

37:33.291 --> 37:36.500
Never again to be united

37:33.291 --> 37:36.500
with those who left you here.

37:36.542 --> 37:38.625
(<i> gasping roar</i> )

37:38.667 --> 37:40.333
WORF:

37:38.667 --> 37:40.333
Energy field

37:38.667 --> 37:40.333
is 2.6.

37:40.375 --> 37:41.750
Computer

37:40.375 --> 37:41.750
beginning

37:40.375 --> 37:41.750
transport.

37:47.792 --> 37:49.917
(<i> gasping</i> )

37:49.959 --> 37:51.834
I'm not taking you anywhere.

37:51.875 --> 37:57.166
(<i> wailing and screaming</i> )

38:07.000 --> 38:10.166
PICARD:

38:07.000 --> 38:10.166
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 41602.1</i>

38:11.417 --> 38:13.375
<i>The shuttlecraft</i>

38:11.417 --> 38:13.375
<i>has been destroyed</i>

38:13.417 --> 38:14.917
<i>to prevent any possibility</i>

38:14.959 --> 38:17.166
<i>of Armus leaving the planet.</i>

38:17.208 --> 38:19.208
<i>Vagra II will be</i>

38:17.208 --> 38:19.208
<i>declared off-limits</i>

38:20.792 --> 38:22.333
<i>but the damage has been done.</i>

38:23.917 --> 38:27.208
<i>One of the saddest duties</i>

38:23.917 --> 38:27.208
<i>I've ever had to perform</i>

38:27.250 --> 38:28.500
<i>is now ahead of me.</i>

38:39.208 --> 38:44.375
We're here together to honor

38:39.208 --> 38:44.375
our friend and comrade--

38:44.417 --> 38:46.250
Lieutenant

38:44.417 --> 38:46.250
Natasha Yar.

38:47.709 --> 38:50.041
Coming to terms

38:47.709 --> 38:50.041
with the loss

38:47.709 --> 38:50.041
of a colleague

38:50.083 --> 38:53.959
is perhaps the

38:50.083 --> 38:53.959
most difficult

38:50.083 --> 38:53.959
task we must face

38:54.000 --> 38:56.125
in the work we have

38:54.000 --> 38:56.125
chosen to pursue.

38:57.458 --> 38:59.208
We will all

38:57.458 --> 38:59.208
find time

38:59.250 --> 39:02.625
to grieve for her in

38:59.250 --> 39:02.625
the days that are ahead

39:02.667 --> 39:07.083
but, for now,

39:02.667 --> 39:07.083
she has asked

39:07.125 --> 39:11.250
that we celebrate

39:07.125 --> 39:11.250
her life... with this.

39:27.875 --> 39:29.166
Hello, my friends.

39:30.834 --> 39:34.000
You are here now watching this

39:30.834 --> 39:34.000
image of me because I have died.

39:35.667 --> 39:38.250
It probably happened

39:35.667 --> 39:38.250
while I was on duty...

39:38.291 --> 39:40.792
and quickly,

39:38.291 --> 39:40.792
which is what I expected.

39:42.667 --> 39:44.166
Never forget I died doing

39:44.208 --> 39:45.709
exactly

39:44.208 --> 39:45.709
what I chose to do.

39:47.250 --> 39:50.458
What I want you to

39:47.250 --> 39:50.458
know is how much

39:47.250 --> 39:50.458
I loved my life

39:50.500 --> 39:52.667
and those of you

39:50.500 --> 39:52.667
who shared it with me.

39:54.333 --> 39:55.500
You are my family.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.333
You all know

39:57.041 --> 39:59.333
where I came from

39:59.375 --> 40:01.291
and what my life

39:59.375 --> 40:01.291
was like before.

40:01.333 --> 40:04.333
But Starfleet took that

40:01.333 --> 40:04.333
frightened angry, young girl

40:04.375 --> 40:05.917
and tempered her.

40:05.959 --> 40:08.834
I have been blessed

40:05.959 --> 40:08.834
with your friendship

40:05.959 --> 40:08.834
and your love.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.166
Will Riker--

40:12.208 --> 40:13.625
you are the best.

40:15.333 --> 40:17.083
You trusted me

40:17.125 --> 40:19.375
you encouraged me

40:19.417 --> 40:21.208
and most of all,

40:19.417 --> 40:21.208
you made me laugh.

40:24.125 --> 40:29.083
Deanna, you are capable

40:24.125 --> 40:29.083
of so much love.

40:30.875 --> 40:32.917
You taught me without

40:30.875 --> 40:32.917
ever having to say a word.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.792
I realized I could be feminine

40:35.000 --> 40:38.792
without losing anything.

40:44.667 --> 40:45.959
Ah, Worf...

40:47.208 --> 40:49.458
we are so

40:47.208 --> 40:49.458
much alike,

40:47.208 --> 40:49.458
you and I--

40:49.500 --> 40:51.667
both warriors--

40:51.709 --> 40:54.041
orphans who found ourselves

40:51.709 --> 40:54.041
this family.

40:56.667 --> 40:57.792
I hope I met death

40:57.834 --> 40:59.625
with my eyes

40:57.834 --> 40:59.625
wide open.

41:01.667 --> 41:05.250
Beverly, your

41:01.667 --> 41:05.250
fierce devotion

41:01.667 --> 41:05.250
comes from within.

41:05.291 --> 41:07.291
It can't

41:05.291 --> 41:07.291
be diminished.

41:07.333 --> 41:12.625
From you, I have learned

41:07.333 --> 41:12.625
to strive for excellence

41:12.667 --> 41:14.500
no matter

41:12.667 --> 41:14.500
what the personal cost.

41:16.458 --> 41:20.125
Wesley, I'm sorry

41:16.458 --> 41:20.125
I won't be able

41:20.166 --> 41:23.583
to see you grow

41:20.166 --> 41:23.583
into the exceptional

41:20.166 --> 41:23.583
man you'll become.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.000
But your kindness

41:25.083 --> 41:28.000
and innocence are ageless.

41:30.625 --> 41:31.750
Geordi...

41:35.208 --> 41:38.750
in those moments

41:35.208 --> 41:38.750
I felt the most despair

41:38.792 --> 41:39.959
you took my hand

41:40.000 --> 41:41.583
and helped me to see

41:40.000 --> 41:41.583
things differently.

41:42.792 --> 41:44.875
You taught me

41:42.792 --> 41:44.875
to look beyond

41:42.792 --> 41:44.875
the moment.

41:46.375 --> 41:48.041
My friend, Data--

41:48.083 --> 41:50.875
you see things

41:48.083 --> 41:50.875
with the wonder

41:48.083 --> 41:50.875
of a child.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.917
And that makes you more human

41:53.125 --> 41:54.917
than any of us.

42:00.917 --> 42:02.291
Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

42:05.166 --> 42:09.041
I wish I could say you've

42:05.166 --> 42:09.041
been like a father to me

42:09.083 --> 42:10.250
but I've never had one

42:10.291 --> 42:12.000
so I don't know

42:10.291 --> 42:12.000
what it feels like.

42:14.667 --> 42:17.125
But if there were someone

42:14.667 --> 42:17.125
in this universe

42:17.166 --> 42:20.417
I could choose to be like--

42:20.458 --> 42:25.041
someone who I would want

42:20.458 --> 42:25.041
to make proud of me--

42:27.000 --> 42:28.083
it's you.

42:29.917 --> 42:33.500
You who have the heart

42:29.917 --> 42:33.500
of an explorer

42:33.542 --> 42:35.208
and the soul

42:33.542 --> 42:35.208
of a poet.

42:36.792 --> 42:38.875
So, you'll

42:36.792 --> 42:38.875
understand

42:36.792 --> 42:38.875
when I say

42:40.959 --> 42:43.083
"death is that state

42:43.125 --> 42:46.291
"in which one exists only

42:43.125 --> 42:46.291
in the memory of others...

42:48.333 --> 42:49.750
which is why it is not an end."

42:53.333 --> 42:54.500
No good-byes.

42:55.750 --> 42:57.375
Just good

42:55.750 --> 42:57.375
memories.

43:00.583 --> 43:02.333
Hailing frequencies

43:00.583 --> 43:02.333
closed, sir.

43:11.333 --> 43:12.583
<i>Au revoir,</i> Natasha.

43:24.500 --> 43:25.709
The gathering is concluded.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.125
Sir...

43:50.166 --> 43:51.834
the purpose

43:50.166 --> 43:51.834
of this gathering...

43:53.750 --> 43:55.583
confuses me.

43:55.625 --> 43:57.000
Oh? How so?

43:59.166 --> 44:02.542
My thoughts

43:59.166 --> 44:02.542
are not for Tasha

44:02.583 --> 44:04.208
but for myself.

44:05.875 --> 44:07.834
I keep thinking

44:07.875 --> 44:09.667
how empty it will be

44:07.875 --> 44:09.667
without her presence.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.583
Did I miss

44:12.250 --> 44:13.583
the point?

44:17.625 --> 44:18.625
No, you didn't,

44:17.625 --> 44:18.625
Data--

44:18.667 --> 44:19.709
you got it.
