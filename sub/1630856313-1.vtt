01:15.541 --> 01:16.708
You never know people.

01:16.791 --> 01:20.166
The people closest to you will
surprise you the most.

01:20.750 --> 01:23.166
I thought it'd be impossible
to explain the concept

01:23.291 --> 01:24.833
of a "situationship" to my dad.

01:24.916 --> 01:26.666
I told him that basically,

01:26.750 --> 01:29.166
you hook up with each other, eat together,

01:29.250 --> 01:30.833
Netflix and chill and that's it.

01:31.666 --> 01:35.208
You don't share your emotions
or real feelings.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.333
And my dad was like,

01:36.416 --> 01:38.833
"Son, I have done all that
with your mother."

01:38.916 --> 01:40.333
"It's called arranged marriage."

01:41.791 --> 01:42.875
I was like, okay!

01:45.166 --> 01:46.291
You never know people.

01:46.375 --> 01:47.583
I have a childhood friend.

01:48.291 --> 01:51.583
We were at boarding school together.
We shared dreams.

01:51.708 --> 01:54.083
And today, guys, he's sitting
in the audience with you.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.791
And since I've been on the stage,

01:56.375 --> 01:57.625
he's been on his phone.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.125
Bro, you had one fucking job!

02:01.208 --> 02:03.333
Sit here and laugh loudly,

02:03.416 --> 02:05.500
so that I'd win this open mic.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.583
Go, Imaad!

02:07.583 --> 02:10.708
By the way, Neil is neither
in a relationship or situationship.

02:10.791 --> 02:12.166
And I wonder why.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.375
I mean, he's a gym trainer.

02:14.458 --> 02:17.666
5'5'' tall. He lives with his parents.

02:18.375 --> 02:19.750
What could be wrong?

02:24.541 --> 02:27.291
There's my other childhood friend.

02:27.375 --> 02:30.416
Ahana. She's also my flatmate.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.416
We aren't in a situation-ship.
We're in a space-ship.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.750
We give each other a lot of space.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.583
She stays in her room, I in mine.

02:39.666 --> 02:41.708
I have my girlfriends and she has Rohan.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.375
Look at them, guys.
They're so adorable, so cute!

02:46.458 --> 02:47.500
Stop.

02:47.583 --> 02:49.458
They've been dating for two years.

02:49.541 --> 02:50.375
Three!

02:50.458 --> 02:54.208
Three years. I'm worried
they'll soon get married.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.166
But you know, Ahana,

02:56.958 --> 02:58.916
I'm not ready for you
to leave this space-ship.

02:59.666 --> 03:03.000
So, Rohan, tell you what.
Move in with us after marriage.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.791
-Yeah.
-Done!

03:04.875 --> 03:07.083
And, guys, I hear Rohan cooks very well.

03:07.166 --> 03:08.208
He's well-organized.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.500
And it's time
we get a full-time house help.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.625
Shut up, Imaad!

03:12.708 --> 03:15.166
Jokes apart, we'll call him Junior.

03:16.208 --> 03:19.166
And it has nothing to do with the pictures
you sent Ahana last night.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.333
Imaad!

03:29.083 --> 03:34.541
All we've got to say is this

03:37.041 --> 03:42.875
We'll live the way we want to live

03:45.458 --> 03:47.583
There's nothing

03:47.666 --> 03:50.083
that can bring us down

03:52.833 --> 03:58.750
We'll take the path our hearts have found

04:00.333 --> 04:03.833
People go, people stay

04:03.916 --> 04:08.166
Let it happen anyway

04:08.250 --> 04:12.083
These days are new and nights are young

04:12.166 --> 04:17.166
Let new songs be sung

04:20.416 --> 04:22.833
Let it happen anyway

04:25.583 --> 04:29.875
We have all the happiness we'll ever need

04:32.208 --> 04:37.666
We're masters of our destiny

04:41.125 --> 04:43.875
What can stop us now?

04:43.958 --> 04:48.208
People go, people stay

04:48.291 --> 04:52.083
Let it happen anyway

04:52.166 --> 04:56.208
These days are new and nights are young

04:56.291 --> 05:01.208
Let new songs be sung

05:01.291 --> 05:04.250
If you feel

05:04.916 --> 05:09.333
Your lover drift away

05:09.416 --> 05:13.041
Just follow

05:13.125 --> 05:16.958
What your heart will say

05:17.041 --> 05:20.875
People go, people stay

05:20.958 --> 05:24.625
Let it happen anyway

05:25.500 --> 05:29.291
These days are new and nights are young

05:29.375 --> 05:33.041
Let new tales be told, new songs be sung

05:33.125 --> 05:40.083
People go, people stay
Let it happen anyway

05:41.083 --> 05:43.083
These days are new and nights are young

05:43.166 --> 05:45.333
Happy New Year!

05:45.416 --> 05:51.000
Let new tales be told, new songs be sung

06:43.333 --> 06:44.666
Good morning.

06:44.750 --> 06:47.625
Hey, you've left?
Why didn't you wake me up?

06:48.291 --> 06:50.958
You looked so peaceful.
I didn't have the heart.

06:51.625 --> 06:54.291
How sweet! Call me later?

06:55.083 --> 06:56.708
Sure. Bye.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.791
See you.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.541
I need to be on my own for some time.

07:08.625 --> 07:12.208
-Tell me the truth.
-There's no one else.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.125
Then what happened? I don't understand!

07:14.208 --> 07:16.791
Ahana, I told you,
I need some clarity in my life.

07:16.916 --> 07:19.250
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-What are you doing?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.666
I must focus on my career.

07:23.750 --> 07:26.375
I need some space. That's all.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.833
Are you an astronaut?
Need space for your career?

07:30.625 --> 07:32.791
You work in your dad's firm.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.958
Please, Rohan, I know
you wanna hook up with other girls.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.250
I just-- I'm done. I can'tâ€¦

07:40.333 --> 07:42.458
-Can't do what? What, Rohan?
-I just can't.

07:42.541 --> 07:43.875
-Huh?
-Nothing.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.833
Nothing ever happens.
Maybe that's the problem!

07:48.416 --> 07:50.625
Is this about sex? We can work on it.

07:50.708 --> 07:52.125
That's another story.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.333
I spoke about marriage.
It freaked you out.

07:54.416 --> 07:56.166
-There's no rush.
-I'm not freaking out.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.291
I just need a break.

08:01.625 --> 08:03.541
For how long? A month? Three months?

08:03.625 --> 08:04.833
I don't know!

08:06.333 --> 08:08.166
What do I tell my parents?

08:08.250 --> 08:10.208
-I don't know.
-What do you know?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.583
Is the house on fire?

08:37.666 --> 08:38.666
What?

08:39.208 --> 08:41.708
-Why was Rohan rushing out?
-Shut up!

08:49.125 --> 08:50.625
What's happened now?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.541
He wants a break.

08:58.291 --> 09:00.333
-From when?
-From now.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.625
Don't worry, he'll be back.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.958
And if he doesn't,
there's always arranged marriage.

09:17.916 --> 09:19.041
How was your date?

09:19.625 --> 09:21.208
Cute. Journalist.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.000
Cute? Seeing her again?

09:27.041 --> 09:28.625
You've got issues, bro.

09:29.875 --> 09:31.666
Don't tell Neil.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.333
He doesn't like Rohan.
When we get back, it'll be awkward.

09:35.416 --> 09:36.625
Okay.

09:41.833 --> 09:42.958
Morning, Neil.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.333
-Baby, your breakfast is ready.
-Thanks, Mama.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.875
And your parcel came yesterday.

09:48.875 --> 09:49.833
Thank you.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.958
-How was Mass?
-It was fine.

09:57.833 --> 09:58.750
Protein got over?

09:59.291 --> 10:00.708
Didn't you just order some?

10:01.625 --> 10:02.791
Neil, 8,000?

10:03.500 --> 10:07.250
-Who asked you to check the bill?
-Someone has to.

10:07.916 --> 10:12.041
Every day 12 egg whites, salmon.
Isn't that enough protein for you?

10:12.166 --> 10:15.250
So I paid for it. I can pay
for everything else too if you want.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.458
Can we please have our breakfast in peace?

10:17.583 --> 10:19.791
All I want is for you to save your money.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.000
And 20 pairs of shoes? Why do you have it?

10:22.083 --> 10:23.791
I need proper sneakers.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.416
Your generation doesn't know
the difference between need and want.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.583
T-shirts and shorts!

10:28.708 --> 10:31.250
Only I know how hard I work
to run this house.

10:38.750 --> 10:42.083
"I don't know
what I've done to upset you."

10:42.916 --> 10:44.625
"Have I done anything at all?"

10:44.708 --> 10:47.958
"This isn't the first time we've argued,
or the last."

10:48.916 --> 10:51.708
"So can you please just tell me
why you want a break?"

10:52.291 --> 10:56.000
"Just don't say you're bored of me.
Or you're looking for someone new."

10:57.375 --> 10:59.291
"I don't understand what you want."

10:59.791 --> 11:01.416
"What are you looking for?"

11:02.458 --> 11:04.166
"What we have is precious, Rohan."

11:04.875 --> 11:07.500
"I don't know
when we stopped communicating."

11:08.541 --> 11:11.083
"Please call me. I'll be waiting."

11:15.833 --> 11:20.833
Hold my hand because I'm taking you
with me to Lalaland.

11:20.916 --> 11:23.333
I'm Lala, but of course you know that.

11:23.416 --> 11:28.958
And today I've brought you all
to sunny, gorgeous Maldives!

11:29.041 --> 11:31.125
To celebrate you guys!

11:31.208 --> 11:33.500
All one million of you.

11:33.583 --> 11:35.791
So let's dance, shake a hip.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.916
Run on the sand, take a dip in the pool.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.125
'Cause life is la-la-la!

11:41.208 --> 11:44.333
At the beautiful Maldives sea villa.

11:44.916 --> 11:47.708
Why does she deserve a free vacation?

11:48.291 --> 11:49.791
She has a million followers, bro.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.541
Wear a bikini and the boys will follow.

11:52.625 --> 11:53.875
Just shut up, man.

11:54.666 --> 11:56.000
She's an influencer.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.875
Who's influenced
by this inflatable horsey?

11:58.958 --> 12:01.875
It works, dude.
People don't know it's all sponsored.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.416
-Hotels, trips, right?
-Exactly.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.125
-She's a marketing genius.
-What?

12:06.208 --> 12:09.708
Looks like the next Neil Pereira rom-com
is coming in a theatre near you.

12:09.791 --> 12:12.375
C'mon, guys, grow up. She's my client.

12:12.458 --> 12:15.291
Client? You went to the Maldives with her?

12:15.375 --> 12:16.458
Yeah, so?

12:16.541 --> 12:17.541
To carry her bags?

12:18.750 --> 12:19.708
To train her.

12:19.791 --> 12:20.875
-To train her!
-Train her.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.541
-Why didn't you post any selfies with her?
-She's just a client, yeah?

12:25.125 --> 12:27.375
Do I need to post every minute of my life?

12:27.458 --> 12:29.833
-This is a little shady.
-Very shady.

12:31.583 --> 12:32.416
Okay, fine.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.625
-Fine? What's that?
-Fine?

12:34.708 --> 12:36.541
-Fine.
-Fine what?

12:36.625 --> 12:38.166
Fine what?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.291
-It's more than that.
-I knew it!

12:40.375 --> 12:41.208
Since when?

12:41.833 --> 12:43.083
It's been a few months.

12:43.791 --> 12:45.458
You've hid it for months?

12:46.416 --> 12:49.125
-She doesn't want people to know.
-So are we just "people"?

12:49.208 --> 12:53.333
Bro, her followers must think
she's single. Attainable.

12:53.916 --> 12:56.875
-We're not her followers.
-You're still not?

12:56.958 --> 12:58.458
-No!
-We're your friends.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.625
So behave like friends.
Just give me some privacy.

13:02.708 --> 13:04.250
-Imaad, he wants privacy.
-Privacy.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.833
-We'll give him privacy.
-You piece of shit!

13:06.958 --> 13:08.958
You want privacy?
When are we gonna meet her?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.791
You want privacy, do you?

13:17.875 --> 13:19.000
Sorry.

13:21.041 --> 13:23.916
Seriously, bro,
this AI shit could end careers.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.208
Yours maybe. Mine hasn't started.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.666
It'll happen, man. You'll be fine.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.791
You're the man. You're good.

13:32.666 --> 13:34.041
Good doesn't cut it anymore, bro.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.500
These days you need to have your
own brand and celebrity clients.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.291
So? You have a celeb. Lala.

13:39.916 --> 13:43.208
Lala today, Lolo tomorrow,
then Bebo. Then Saifu!

13:48.666 --> 13:51.833
But seriously, man, I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing with my life.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.208
I want to open my own gym.
That'll be a game changer.

13:57.291 --> 13:58.250
So do it!

13:59.291 --> 14:01.125
You should've told me earlier.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.291
I have some rupees saved. I can open
two branches this week. What say?

14:06.375 --> 14:09.125
Man, I have no idea what I'm doing either.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.916
Tell you what.
Let's try till we're thirty.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.458
And if nothing works out,
Ahana will support us both.

14:15.541 --> 14:17.625
I'm sure she's already planning for it.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.958
Ahana's sorted, man.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.750
What is she doing with Rohan?

14:24.625 --> 14:25.833
Rohan wants a break.

14:26.416 --> 14:29.083
-What?
-I didn't say a word. You know nothing.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.833
Rohan wants a break from Ahana?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.458
-Guts.
-I know.

14:37.250 --> 14:38.208
Guts.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.833
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

15:02.666 --> 15:04.750
PLEASE CALL ME. I'M WAITING.

15:26.833 --> 15:29.375
Why has Rohan posted
a photo of a cake at dawn?

15:29.958 --> 15:30.958
What?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.708
-Bro, that's a cupcake.
-Same thing.

15:33.791 --> 15:35.416
How's it the same thing?

15:35.500 --> 15:37.750
-A cupcake is part of the cake family.
-So?

15:37.833 --> 15:40.000
A cupcake has its own identity.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.791
Its own personality.
You'd call a pastry a cake?

15:42.875 --> 15:44.333
-You nuts?
-A pastry is a pastry.

15:44.416 --> 15:45.375
-You're mad.
-You are.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.916
If I post a photo of an Alsatian,
I can't call it a dog?

15:48.041 --> 15:50.083
-South Bombay elitist!
-You call Messi by name.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.875
-Navi Mumbai isâ€¦
-Your dad's houseâ€¦

15:51.958 --> 15:53.750
Shut up! Just shut up!

16:02.916 --> 16:05.916
I want a break, or I want to break up?

16:06.958 --> 16:09.916
Ahana, is the Adrena-Fit
proposal deck ready?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.708
-I've mailed it to you.
-Great. Thank you.

16:13.583 --> 16:16.708
You planned the whole strategy
and she'll take the credit.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.583
He uploaded a photo of a cake
this morning.

16:20.666 --> 16:23.875
-What?
-Yeah, cupcake. And a heart.

16:23.958 --> 16:25.208
Cupcake?

16:27.166 --> 16:28.250
Let's check.

16:29.375 --> 16:35.125
Stacy Gomes, Mrinalini Jaisinghani,
Trisha Mariwala, Anoushka Gupta.

16:35.708 --> 16:37.333
-Kylie Jennerâ€¦
-Kylie Jenner.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.291
Dude, all boys follow Kylie.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.083
-Who's the dream girl?
-Ayush's sister.

16:42.166 --> 16:45.041
-Butter Cupcakes?
-Open that.

16:47.666 --> 16:49.750
This is where the cupcake was from.

16:52.333 --> 16:53.958
"Tanyabuttercupfly."

16:55.250 --> 16:56.125
Tanya Mehra.

16:56.208 --> 17:00.250
Just a girl with a sweet tooth
and a sweet life. Sparkle emoji.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.666
Always remember to sprinkle laughter,

17:03.750 --> 17:07.291
spontaneity and kindness
onto every single cupcake.

17:07.375 --> 17:10.041
#baketheworldabetterplace.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.458
Let me see.

17:20.583 --> 17:24.125
-Let's check her stories.
-She'll see my name.

17:24.625 --> 17:27.250
We'll make a fake account. Give.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.458
"I want a break" basically means,
"I want to hook up with someone else."

17:35.166 --> 17:38.458
You said you were never in a relationship.

17:38.541 --> 17:40.208
-Then how so sure?
-I know, right?

17:40.291 --> 17:41.875
Maybe I should be a therapist.

17:42.416 --> 17:45.125
But I can't pull off your cardigan look.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.500
You come to this session
to talk about you.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.333
Not about Ahana or my cardigan.

17:52.416 --> 17:53.750
Aren't we stuck in a loop?

17:54.333 --> 17:57.208
I think you've built a wall
around yourself.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.083
And you won't let anyone in.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.833
But you deserve a healthy,
loving relationship.

18:05.541 --> 18:09.000
What I really deserve is for dad
to stop sending me to these sessions.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.000
You know, Imaad, the thing about shame is

18:14.541 --> 18:18.875
the more you hide it, the more it grows.

18:20.291 --> 18:23.916
-But when we've talked about it--
-It's been 14 years.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.750
Let's both forget it.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.750
Where did you buy your cardigan?

18:34.125 --> 18:36.291
-You're sure this will work?
-Trust me, bro.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.958
It'll strengthen the glutes,
build endurance,

18:40.041 --> 18:42.583
-and it'll also protect the knees.
-That's good.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.916
That's it. Squat, hold that, stabilize.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Pelvis tucked in. Chest up, bam!

18:47.083 --> 18:49.875
-Shoulders drop, yeah.
-Perfect.

18:49.958 --> 18:52.791
-Let's go for one last. Just on one leg.
-All right.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.708
This will strengthen your glutes.

18:55.250 --> 18:58.208
-It'll build endurance.
-One, two.

18:58.750 --> 18:59.666
One more.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.416
Protect the knees from injury.
Drop your shoulders.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.833
Lengthen the spine.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.500
Breathe. Smile.

19:09.625 --> 19:13.708
-Why can't I look like Malaika?
-Why do you need to?

19:13.791 --> 19:16.500
Take care of yourself
and that makes you beautiful, right?

19:17.125 --> 19:19.791
C'mon, nine, ten.

19:20.375 --> 19:21.625
C'mon, Anita, let's go.

19:22.958 --> 19:23.833
Eleven.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.750
I might not know Uganda's capital,

19:26.833 --> 19:30.166
but I know what Malaika Arora wore
to the gym yesterday.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.958
Even our attention span is
getting shorter.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.000
We used to watch five-day test matches.

19:36.083 --> 19:39.208
And now if a video isn't interesting
in the first five seconds,

19:39.291 --> 19:40.708
we go, "This guy is a drag!"

19:41.625 --> 19:44.833
I think the only people
who can perform in less than five seconds

19:44.958 --> 19:46.250
are Indian men in bed.

19:50.291 --> 19:51.791
Too close to home, ma'am!

19:53.250 --> 19:54.708
Are you guys together?

19:54.791 --> 19:55.750
Sorry, sir.

19:58.958 --> 20:02.333
We come across someone's profile
who has a life we aspire to have,

20:02.416 --> 20:04.625
we instantly follow them.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.166
We feel insecure and depressed
looking at the profile,

20:09.250 --> 20:10.958
but we are willingly following it.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.541
How stupid is that?

20:13.291 --> 20:16.291
If you want a daily reminder
that you're a disappointment,

20:16.458 --> 20:17.458
just call your dad.

20:17.541 --> 20:20.458
He's still wishing his son will
change the world one day.

20:22.083 --> 20:27.875
I read a survey that an average person
checks their phone 224 times a day. Wow!

20:27.958 --> 20:31.250
If you're repeating an activity
224 times a day,

20:31.333 --> 20:33.541
it's not an activity, it's an addiction.

20:35.541 --> 20:38.833
And we have become addicted
to other peoples' lives.

20:38.916 --> 20:42.708
Enough! We've got blinders on
and our brains in a straitjacket.

20:43.916 --> 20:46.833
I don't want to know what you're doing,
thinking or eating.

20:46.958 --> 20:48.250
I have better things to do.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.375
Like finding out what Malaika Arora
wore to the gym today.

20:53.458 --> 20:55.291
That's my time, thank you so much.

20:55.375 --> 20:59.458
Also, we have a very special guest
tonight, and a dear friend.

20:59.541 --> 21:01.708
Please give it up for Sapan Verma!

21:06.708 --> 21:10.208
Hello! Give it up for Imaad, everybody.
C'mon, once more!

21:10.291 --> 21:12.875
We need some commercial material.

21:12.958 --> 21:15.000
Something meme-worthy that goes viral.

21:15.083 --> 21:18.916
Tap into tier two, tier three space, man.
Take it to the next level.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.458
That's my next level?
Become a meme or a virus?

21:21.541 --> 21:24.125
Of course! Anyway, listen to me.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.375
There's a high-profile wedding next week.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.583
-You're hosting it.
-And you're gonna dance.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.666
-Bye, Melbun.
-That means we're on, right?

21:33.666 --> 21:36.666
-Did you see the new Vir Das special?
-Yes.

21:36.750 --> 21:37.750
It was okay.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
Okay?

21:41.000 --> 21:45.333
I loved it.
The way he worked the audience.

21:45.416 --> 21:46.583
When's your special?

21:47.500 --> 21:50.250
-It'll happen. Takes time.
-Set a cutoff date.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.916
When I was your age, I was a self--

21:52.000 --> 21:54.416
I know! You had your own car and kids.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.250
Even walked on the moon.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.583
I can look after myself, Dad. Don't worry.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.541
I know.

22:01.125 --> 22:03.375
All I'm saying is, be smart.

22:03.458 --> 22:06.958
The house and money your mother
left you won't last forever.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.083
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

22:11.583 --> 22:12.750
Imaad bhaiya!

22:12.833 --> 22:14.000
Hey!

22:14.083 --> 22:17.000
-Hello!
-Hello! Hi!

22:17.833 --> 22:19.500
-Bedtime?
-Yes.

22:20.125 --> 22:22.750
-Give your brother a kiss. Come on.
-Come on.

22:26.125 --> 22:27.458
Drive the knee up.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.916
Close. That's it. Good. Come down.

22:34.333 --> 22:37.958
Yeah, and all the way up,
and maintain that line.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.875
Kettlebell close.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.000
Engage the core. C'mon, Lala, focus!

22:43.958 --> 22:46.000
-Man!
-What's up?

22:46.666 --> 22:49.125
That old man keeps staring
through that window.

22:49.208 --> 22:51.000
-What old man?
-Nothing.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.916
Don't open it.
He just stands right there and stares.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.500
File a complaint.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.208
-And say what exactly?
-That he keeps staring.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.250
Half the country would be in jail then.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.166
Unbelievable!

23:06.041 --> 23:07.041
You're cute.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.166
Finish your set, c'mon.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.916
And very professional.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.541
Ahana and Imaad want to meet you.

23:34.375 --> 23:35.791
What's your scene tomorrow?

23:36.708 --> 23:39.458
I'm taking my parents out
for dinner tomorrow.

23:41.166 --> 23:42.375
Some other time?

23:43.083 --> 23:44.416
Yeah, sounds good.

23:46.208 --> 23:49.750
Come, let's get some squats in.
Come on. Let's go!

23:55.791 --> 23:56.666
Zeeshan?

23:57.250 --> 23:58.625
-Hi, Simran.
-Hi.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.375
-Please come in.
-Thanks.

24:07.500 --> 24:08.916
Oh, wow!

24:13.250 --> 24:17.041
-You know, I wasn't expecting this.
-Is that a compliment or an insult?

24:17.125 --> 24:19.833
No, no, it's really nice.
It's got character.

24:20.500 --> 24:24.625
Some things look brand new, others look
like they've been here forever.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.208
So I think we should just
jump right into it.

24:33.291 --> 24:37.125
Might be a bit awkward at first,
but, you knowâ€¦

24:37.208 --> 24:40.291
I usually don't allow a camera
on the first date.

24:41.375 --> 24:43.541
I told you I wanted to photograph you.

24:44.333 --> 24:46.125
I thought that was an excuse.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.083
No, I'm a photographer.

24:48.166 --> 24:50.958
It's for a project of mine.
It's called "The people of Tinder."

24:51.583 --> 24:53.875
Nice. So you want to interview me?

24:53.958 --> 24:54.916
Kinda.

24:56.083 --> 24:57.083
Con artist.

24:58.083 --> 24:58.916
That's me.

25:02.208 --> 25:05.791
So you want to meet the person
behind the profile?

25:05.875 --> 25:08.125
Thanks. I guess.

25:08.208 --> 25:12.041
I want to understand
who you are when you're alone.

25:12.125 --> 25:13.500
But I'm not alone.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.500
Yeah, I know.
Just ignore me. Do your thing.

25:18.250 --> 25:21.750
Tough! Your presence is
really affecting your art.

25:22.833 --> 25:24.333
You interested or should I go?

25:25.416 --> 25:26.708
Are you breaking up with me?

25:31.958 --> 25:33.166
How old are you?

25:33.250 --> 25:34.291
Twenty-five.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.625
-What do you do?
-I'm a stand-up comic.

25:38.708 --> 25:41.250
You know the problem with political jokes?

25:41.333 --> 25:42.833
They get elected sometimes.

25:43.958 --> 25:44.833
Why comedy?

25:46.166 --> 25:47.250
Dad, is that you?

25:48.875 --> 25:51.833
When did you first realize you were funny?

25:53.416 --> 25:56.291
I think it was when I was really sad.

26:02.625 --> 26:04.166
What's with this ring?

26:07.708 --> 26:08.958
It belonged to my mother.

26:14.583 --> 26:15.833
You ever been in love?

26:18.875 --> 26:21.666
What? Come on,
never had your heart broken?

26:22.750 --> 26:23.750
Once.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.708
How old were you?

26:28.625 --> 26:30.208
-Nine.
-Nine?

26:31.708 --> 26:33.125
We don't get to choose that shit.

26:40.541 --> 26:43.625
"So, have you ever been in love?"

26:49.250 --> 26:51.250
Yes. I have.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.000
Bye, Zeeshan.

27:00.291 --> 27:01.875
It's Imaad.

27:01.958 --> 27:05.583
-What?
-Zeeshan's for Tinder. My name is Imaad.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.208
Wow!

27:08.083 --> 27:08.958
Bye.

27:23.708 --> 27:28.250
The easiest way to change one's
perspective is to move to a new city.

27:29.875 --> 27:32.416
Life is a collection of moments.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.416
Choose your lens wisely.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.875
C'mon, Ashish, let's go, brother.
No stopping.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.333
Squat deeper. Engage the core.

27:49.416 --> 27:53.291
Less of shoulders. C'mon, engage the core.
Keep going. No stopping. Use--

27:54.750 --> 27:56.875
-Take it easy.
-Dude.

27:58.333 --> 28:01.041
-Yeezy 350s?
-Yeah, bro.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.250
Been trying to cop these babies
for months.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.625
-All right! 30 seconds up. C'mon.
-Bro.

28:07.541 --> 28:08.875
You're gonna kill me, bro.

28:09.791 --> 28:11.833
That's why I tell you
to come to the gym.

28:11.916 --> 28:14.125
You'll feel more motivated
seeing other people.

28:14.208 --> 28:16.333
Too crowded, man. Not my scene.

28:18.333 --> 28:21.500
Wait till I open my own studio.
It'll be perfect for you.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.791
-You're opening your own studio?
-Yeah.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.833
Only ten clients at a time.
Tailor-made services for each.

28:28.916 --> 28:32.083
Calisthenics, CrossFit, power lifting,
yoga, you name it.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.333
Superb, bro. Sign me up, baby.

28:36.041 --> 28:37.375
All right. Let's get this.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.791
Squat. That's it!

28:39.875 --> 28:41.333
I did a market survey.

28:41.416 --> 28:43.958
The fitness industry is booming.
You have to do it.

28:44.041 --> 28:46.875
-I'm preparing a budget.
-You need a business plan.

28:46.958 --> 28:49.583
If only ten clients come at a time,
how will you make money?

28:51.208 --> 28:54.041
Your gym should be so exclusive
so that you can charge more.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.375
Investors must believe
this idea is scalable.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.041
Yeah.

28:58.125 --> 29:01.208
You know what I think?
There should be two studios in Mumbai.

29:01.291 --> 29:04.875
-One in Bangalore, one in Delhi.
-Dude, that is the dream.

29:05.458 --> 29:08.666
And you can launch an app.
You can have a nutritionist.

29:08.750 --> 29:12.791
You can have specialized meals,
athleisure, diet plans.

29:12.875 --> 29:14.833
You can have kickboxing, Zumba.

29:14.916 --> 29:16.166
-Shit.
-Everything.

29:17.583 --> 29:18.666
What?

29:19.791 --> 29:21.250
MBA, bitches!

29:25.250 --> 29:28.541
If I found someone like you,
I'd be sorted.

29:30.333 --> 29:32.791
Why "like" me? You've got me.

29:34.875 --> 29:35.750
What about your job?

29:37.291 --> 29:38.125
I'll quit.

29:39.250 --> 29:41.000
That place is a dead end.

29:42.708 --> 29:44.916
You'll run everything.
You set up the studio,

29:45.000 --> 29:47.041
I'll handle expansion and management.

29:50.458 --> 29:53.458
-You're hired. Let's do this.
-Seriously?

29:53.541 --> 29:54.666
You're hired!

29:55.833 --> 29:56.708
What about the money?

29:56.791 --> 29:59.791
We'll make a killer pitch,
flirt with some investors.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.083
Guys.

30:02.583 --> 30:03.583
I'm in.

30:05.041 --> 30:06.625
How much money do you need?

30:08.166 --> 30:09.166
How?

30:10.791 --> 30:14.583
Mum left me some money,
and I have to invest it smartly.

30:14.666 --> 30:17.250
This is how.

30:18.375 --> 30:20.458
-Bro, you're serious?
-Yeah.

30:20.541 --> 30:23.000
Imaad, we humbly accept your offer.

30:23.833 --> 30:27.333
But, guys, it'll take time to break even,
so you must be sure.

30:28.708 --> 30:32.500
Look, guys. If I have to invest,
I want to invest in you two.

30:32.583 --> 30:33.583
I trust you guys.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.875
Fuck! Guys, is this actually happening?

30:37.458 --> 30:38.500
It is.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.500
Shit!

30:43.750 --> 30:46.083
-To the Jungle Gym.
-The Jungle Gym?

30:46.708 --> 30:49.583
-The Jungle Gym.
-I love it.

30:49.666 --> 30:51.250
To the Jungle Gym!

30:51.333 --> 30:54.625
So, friends, let us convert our friendship
into a relationship!

30:58.541 --> 31:00.250
To the Jungle Gym!

31:15.625 --> 31:17.958
I wanna see you dance

31:23.416 --> 31:25.583
I wanna see you dance

31:25.666 --> 31:27.750
-Sir, your bill.
-Give it here.

31:28.708 --> 31:30.583
-You always pay.
-Chill, man.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.958
Is this what boys like?

31:34.291 --> 31:37.000
-Let it go! Why you looking at her?
-I've made a fake account.

31:37.083 --> 31:38.000
What?

31:38.500 --> 31:41.458
Or else she'll know
I'm following her stories.

31:41.541 --> 31:44.291
Just ask Rohan.
Why are you playing detective?

31:44.791 --> 31:47.500
She needs to block Rohan. And drink.

31:48.583 --> 31:49.458
Fine.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.208
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

31:53.375 --> 31:54.500
Isn't that Lala?

31:56.041 --> 31:57.000
Isn't it?

31:57.083 --> 31:59.000
-Yes.
-Yes. It's her.

32:00.791 --> 32:01.833
I'll be back.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.083
-Who's she with?
-Who's she with?

32:08.375 --> 32:09.375
-Jinx.
-Jinx.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.250
-Where do you want to do it?
-We can do it at anyâ€¦

32:14.416 --> 32:16.083
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.208
Kartik, Neil.

32:21.291 --> 32:22.583
Neil's my trainer.

32:23.083 --> 32:26.416
Oh, so you're responsible
for the way she looks?

32:26.500 --> 32:27.333
Stop.

32:28.666 --> 32:31.125
-I need a drink. Do you want something?
-I'm good.

32:31.208 --> 32:33.083
-How about you? Drink?
-Cheers.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.708
So? Weren't you going
to dinner with your parents?

32:42.291 --> 32:44.958
Yes, I was. Then they went to bed.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.083
Kartik is launching his own gin brand.

32:50.166 --> 32:52.750
I could be the face
of his online campaign.

32:52.833 --> 32:54.958
It's a big deal for me, Neil.

32:58.250 --> 33:02.041
Yeah. You know what,
I want a crate of that gin.

33:02.125 --> 33:02.958
I'm trying.

33:03.041 --> 33:04.416
-Bro.
-Sorry.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.583
-Have a good night. Cheers.
-You too. Cheers.

33:09.583 --> 33:12.916
-Ahana, hi!
-Aisha, hi.

33:13.000 --> 33:15.875
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

33:15.958 --> 33:18.166
I saw the photos.
Maldives must've been amazing.

33:18.250 --> 33:21.583
Oh my God, babe,
he proposed to me in a car.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.500
Like in a parking lot.

33:23.583 --> 33:27.541
I was like, "Press pause, please.
We're doing this on a beach."

33:28.250 --> 33:31.375
-Parking lot? How dare he?
-Right? Imagine!

33:31.458 --> 33:33.625
Didn't he consider all your followers?

33:33.708 --> 33:35.541
-He should've.
-Classic.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.250
-Hi, Imaad.
-Hi.

33:37.333 --> 33:38.416
Always a pleasure.

33:39.333 --> 33:42.416
So you're coming, right? You're in?
Counting you in. You too, babe.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.250
-100%.
-Yes, 100%.

33:44.333 --> 33:45.875
Neil, I'm getting married!

33:45.958 --> 33:47.416
I need another drink.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.875
Let's drink up.

33:51.125 --> 33:54.750
Don't get me wrong
This is my kinda song

33:54.833 --> 33:58.375
You had better sing along
It's been really really long

33:58.458 --> 34:02.208
Come on, come to me, my love

34:03.666 --> 34:05.500
I wanna see you dance

34:07.625 --> 34:09.875
I wanna see you dance

34:11.625 --> 34:13.333
I wanna see you dance

34:15.541 --> 34:17.458
I wanna see you dance

34:19.583 --> 34:21.250
I wanna see you dance

34:23.083 --> 34:25.250
I wanna see you dance

34:27.125 --> 34:29.416
I wanna see you dance

34:31.166 --> 34:33.083
I wanna see you dance

34:35.166 --> 34:36.708
I wanna see you dance

34:39.208 --> 34:41.375
I wanna see you dance

34:42.791 --> 34:45.166
I wanna see you dance

34:47.083 --> 34:48.750
I wanna see you dance

34:51.000 --> 34:52.708
I wanna see you dance

35:01.291 --> 35:03.041
Rohan, I really need to talk to you.

35:03.125 --> 35:06.250
I swear I won't talk about the break.

35:06.333 --> 35:07.916
Rohan, just tell me the truth.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.875
What the fuck?
Why can't you just call me back?

35:10.958 --> 35:13.250
I know you're seeing Cupcake.
It's disgusting.

35:13.333 --> 35:15.958
Like, I just knew
that this was going to happen.

35:16.041 --> 35:19.000
Rohan, you coward. Just pick up!

35:19.083 --> 35:21.583
Am I not good enough for you?
What's wrong with me?

35:21.666 --> 35:24.041
This is a stupid game,
and you're going to call me back.

35:24.125 --> 35:26.791
I love you and it's going
to be fine, okay? I promise.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.291
â€¦is not answering.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.791
-Thank you, guys, so much.
-Thank you so much.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.958
Hope to see you again soon.

35:40.041 --> 35:41.291
After you, madame.

35:41.958 --> 35:44.583
She seems so happy,
passing off my work as her own.

35:44.666 --> 35:46.583
How can she be so shameless, bro?

35:46.666 --> 35:47.666
-Bye.
-Yes.

35:47.750 --> 35:49.083
-Sure.
-Buh-bye.

35:49.708 --> 35:50.958
I'm done with this job.

36:05.791 --> 36:07.416
At least he's sorry.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.333
No?

36:10.333 --> 36:12.708
He's sorry
because he really is with Tanya.

36:24.166 --> 36:25.166
Ahana.

36:30.166 --> 36:31.125
Call me later.

37:17.791 --> 37:19.666
Rohan, you coward. Just pick up!

37:19.750 --> 37:23.000
Ahana, I made you some coffee.

37:23.583 --> 37:25.250
What's wrong? Why so down?

37:28.958 --> 37:30.166
Aren't you late for office?

37:31.500 --> 37:32.708
I took the day off.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.125
Check this out.

37:41.541 --> 37:42.541
Cute.

37:42.625 --> 37:44.958
-Yeah?
-Yeah. It's nice.

37:45.625 --> 37:48.250
Wanna see more? Come over today.

37:49.250 --> 37:52.958
You're going to hers, Imaad?
You wanna see more?

37:54.166 --> 37:56.000
Work on our million-dollar idea.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.416
Dad wants to see the business plan, okay?

37:58.500 --> 38:02.000
And stalking Cupcake needs to stop.

38:04.208 --> 38:05.875
This is disgusting.

38:05.958 --> 38:08.708
-Your coffee is a fail.
-Divorce!

38:09.708 --> 38:11.625
So now you're
asking your friends for money?

38:11.708 --> 38:13.791
I'm not asking, Dad.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.125
Imaad is investing.
It'll be his business too.

38:16.208 --> 38:18.458
If he's financing your life,
he'll rub it in your face.

38:18.541 --> 38:21.875
-You want to be his servant?
-You're talking about my best friend.

38:21.958 --> 38:23.666
Never do business with friends.

38:23.750 --> 38:25.625
Not everyone has the same experience.

38:28.666 --> 38:32.333
What do you know about business? You spent
your life doing others' accounts.

38:32.416 --> 38:34.666
-Neil.
-What? It's true.

38:36.708 --> 38:38.791
What are you doing? This is too fast.

38:38.875 --> 38:40.416
You need cardio, Anita.

38:41.125 --> 38:43.833
Cardio. Not cardiac.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.208
Sorry, one sec. Keep running.

38:47.291 --> 38:48.416
Yo, Harsh.

38:48.541 --> 38:51.083
-Bro, I'm in Alibaug this weekend.
-Okay.

38:51.166 --> 38:54.125
There's a session with Malaika Arora.
I need you to take it.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.041
Sure, bro, that'll be great. Yeah.
That'll be great. Thanks, man.

38:58.125 --> 38:59.541
You got this. Make me proud.

38:59.625 --> 39:01.375
-All right, cheers.
-Cheers.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.250
Oh my God!

39:46.750 --> 39:49.208
-You killed me today, Neil.
-No, you killed it.

39:49.291 --> 39:51.166
-Hot.
-Awesome.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.916
All right. I'll see you soon.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.250
-Bye.
-Bye.

39:56.541 --> 39:59.125
-You want a picture?
-No, it's all right.

39:59.208 --> 40:01.458
-C'mon, let's get one.
-It's okay. You sure?

40:01.541 --> 40:03.666
-Yeah, c'mon.
-Wow, okay. Thanks.

40:03.750 --> 40:04.958
-Hold on to this.
-Yeah, sure.

40:11.250 --> 40:12.250
What's your handle?

40:14.083 --> 40:16.000
@neilpereira96.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.208
If you had asked me to,
I wouldn't have posted it.

40:20.958 --> 40:22.875
-But I like this picture.
-It's great.

40:22.958 --> 40:24.833
-Bye, see you soon.
-See you.

40:25.500 --> 40:26.916
-Malaikaâ€¦
-Yeah?

40:28.541 --> 40:31.125
-Thanks for killing me.
-Yeah.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.291
Fuck!

44:17.375 --> 44:18.916
He's taking photos of me.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.208
Who? The old uncle?

44:22.291 --> 44:23.791
And he's tagged me too.

44:25.041 --> 44:28.083
It's through this window. It must be him.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.458
"Paresh Phadnis."

44:30.250 --> 44:31.833
What a creep!

44:32.416 --> 44:34.791
-Fucker!
-Neil, I've reported it.

44:36.875 --> 44:38.333
Neil, where are you going?

44:50.958 --> 44:52.333
See who's there.

44:55.500 --> 44:57.458
-Where's Paresh Phadnis?
-Who are you?

44:58.333 --> 45:00.541
Come here. You asshole.

45:01.541 --> 45:03.041
Did you post this photo?

45:05.291 --> 45:06.750
Yes, I did. What's the problem?

45:07.375 --> 45:10.791
You're stalking a girl.
Posting photos of her, tagging her.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.208
It's harassment. Isn't that a problem?

45:16.166 --> 45:17.625
-Piss off.
-Neil.

45:17.708 --> 45:20.500
If she doesn't want to be seen,
then she shouldn't show off.

45:21.666 --> 45:22.500
Show off what?

45:23.083 --> 45:26.583
Look at her clothes.
You can see everything.

45:27.958 --> 45:30.250
If she can post her pictures, why can't I?

45:30.333 --> 45:31.833
-Paresh!
-Neil!

45:32.833 --> 45:34.416
It's her body not yours.

45:35.208 --> 45:39.083
If she wants to post pictures of herself,
she can. Not you.

45:40.541 --> 45:42.791
-Get it?
-Neil, there's a kid. Let's go.

45:48.583 --> 45:50.500
I better not catch you peeping again.

45:55.291 --> 45:56.875
I can't believe you did that.

46:00.291 --> 46:03.500
I can't believe people do whatever
on social media and think it's okay.

46:15.291 --> 46:16.375
Are you okay?

46:18.166 --> 46:20.083
Hold it like a pen. Like a pen.

46:20.166 --> 46:21.875
-Like that?
-Yeah, and swirl.

46:21.958 --> 46:24.666
Swirl. And?

46:24.750 --> 46:26.916
-No.
-What's so funny?

46:28.833 --> 46:30.416
I came to Mumbai for two weeks,

46:30.500 --> 46:33.291
and here I am, a year later,
sitting with a 25-year-old kid.

46:41.916 --> 46:43.041
I'm not a kid.

46:44.708 --> 46:47.416
Then stop acting like one.
Pour me some wine, please.

46:48.708 --> 46:50.541
-Okay.
-Okay.

46:52.125 --> 46:52.958
Okay.

47:02.875 --> 47:03.708
That's Adil.

47:04.625 --> 47:06.500
We were together for six years.

47:12.750 --> 47:14.958
-Cancer?
-Yeah.

47:21.916 --> 47:22.958
I'm sorry.

47:25.958 --> 47:28.125
Yeah, it's messed up.

47:30.416 --> 47:31.583
It is.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.416
This shoot was Adil's idea.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.416
Now I understand, he was showing me a way,

47:41.500 --> 47:43.625
you know, to say goodbye.

47:49.458 --> 47:50.625
I'll need some more.

47:53.791 --> 47:55.875
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

47:57.416 --> 47:59.916
We're fortunate to be artists.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.500
Our art helps to make sense of our lives.

48:03.583 --> 48:05.625
-I'm a stand-up comic.
-So?

48:06.208 --> 48:09.041
Humor is your way to express yourself.

48:09.125 --> 48:10.958
To show people your perspective.

48:11.041 --> 48:12.125
You're an artist.

48:13.125 --> 48:14.083
I'm an artist.

48:19.666 --> 48:21.125
What happened to your mother?

48:25.291 --> 48:26.458
Leukemia.

48:28.958 --> 48:29.958
How old were you?

48:31.083 --> 48:32.083
Nine.

48:34.041 --> 48:36.625
Yeah, we don't get to choose
that shit, do we?

48:56.625 --> 48:57.958
Ahana!

49:00.583 --> 49:01.875
Knock!

49:06.666 --> 49:10.125
You took another day off? What's going on?

49:10.875 --> 49:11.916
Relax, Mom.

49:13.458 --> 49:15.916
Where were you? With the photographer?

49:16.916 --> 49:18.625
The photographer's name is Simran.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.916
Oh, this one has a name. Had fun?

49:25.875 --> 49:28.125
None of your business. You had lunch?

49:29.166 --> 49:30.583
None of your business.

49:31.416 --> 49:32.625
Now get out.

49:32.708 --> 49:35.708
-Get up!
-Imaad!

49:37.791 --> 49:38.833
Yes!

49:39.416 --> 49:40.958
He hasn't even called?

49:42.291 --> 49:43.750
What a bastard, man.

49:44.416 --> 49:48.666
-From now on, you train with me.
-Please, life is painful as it is.

49:49.250 --> 49:50.708
You'll have fun, I promise.

49:50.791 --> 49:52.166
Imaad will join us, right?

49:52.250 --> 49:53.458
No, thank you.

49:54.333 --> 49:57.125
Imaad needs to focus
on his modelling career.

49:57.208 --> 49:59.750
For his new photographer girlfriend.

49:59.833 --> 50:02.750
He's in love.

50:04.208 --> 50:08.416
-Who are you conning now?
-Go flex some muscles. Bob the Builder.

50:11.125 --> 50:12.666
Defensive. All right.

50:12.750 --> 50:16.208
Imaad loves the photographer.

50:16.791 --> 50:18.125
You were better depressed.

50:18.708 --> 50:19.791
You're canceled.

50:21.125 --> 50:22.875
He's met her twice.

50:24.541 --> 50:25.875
-Twice?
-Twice.

50:25.958 --> 50:28.708
-Bro, that's long term.
-We just talked. That's it.

50:31.416 --> 50:32.916
You talk too?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.125
All night long!

50:36.000 --> 50:39.458
-Go to hell!
-Aww, he's blushing!

50:39.541 --> 50:42.833
Imaad, man, it's love.
It happens. You can't control it.

50:42.916 --> 50:44.625
-Get lost, idiot.
-Correct.

50:44.708 --> 50:48.000
I'm outta here.
I have a meeting. With Melbun.

50:48.666 --> 50:49.500
-Bye.
-Bye.

50:49.625 --> 50:50.791
Bye.

50:52.916 --> 50:54.416
She's pretty cool actually.

50:55.625 --> 50:58.583
And? Is there anything romantic there?

51:00.083 --> 51:01.750
We kissed, twice.

51:05.166 --> 51:07.583
It's not a big deal.
No need to tell your diary.

51:07.666 --> 51:10.041
You're taking it slow. That's good.

51:10.791 --> 51:13.291
I mean, we're friends.

51:14.458 --> 51:17.166
I think she also thinks we're friends.

51:17.250 --> 51:21.541
Interesting. You're thinking
about what she's thinking.

51:29.041 --> 51:29.875
Looking good.

51:32.041 --> 51:34.708
You should have a larger share.
Ahana smaller.

51:35.458 --> 51:37.708
She's the CEO
and you can always replace her.

51:38.291 --> 51:40.458
It's Ahana's plan, Dad. I replace her?

51:42.416 --> 51:44.000
She was always the smarter one.

51:45.208 --> 51:46.666
Do you trust them?

51:46.750 --> 51:48.166
I only have two friends.

51:48.916 --> 51:50.375
Everyone gets an equal share.

51:51.750 --> 51:52.750
Okay.

51:52.833 --> 51:55.125
Starting my own business is
a big opportunity.

51:55.208 --> 51:57.083
I can finally put my MBA to good use.

51:57.166 --> 52:00.541
-Also a big risk, but all the best, Ahana.
-Thank you, sir.

52:00.625 --> 52:03.083
-You have a two-month notice period.
-Yes, of course.

52:03.166 --> 52:07.750
-I'll miss you, Ahana.
-Don't be silly! You never needed me.

52:09.875 --> 52:12.333
-Thank you, sir.
-Bye, Ahana. Thank you.

52:41.375 --> 52:44.666
You know, you know
What's in that head of yours

52:44.750 --> 52:47.333
You also know you can't just be so sure

52:47.458 --> 52:48.750
So I'll ask you

52:48.875 --> 52:51.416
Well, I'll ask you

52:52.083 --> 52:55.458
You know, you know, you know
You want escape

52:55.583 --> 52:58.166
You know you're trying not to hesitate

52:58.291 --> 52:59.625
Let me ask you

52:59.708 --> 53:01.958
Let me ask you right now

53:02.041 --> 53:05.083
Are you a cool kid?
Are you a cute kid?

53:05.166 --> 53:07.833
Do you fit in?
And do they like it?

53:07.916 --> 53:10.666
Tell me what can you do to make it okay

53:10.750 --> 53:13.500
To make it look
Like you don't wanna be like them

53:13.583 --> 53:15.708
Cool kid?
Are you a cute kid?

53:15.833 --> 53:18.375
Do you fit in?
And do they like it?

53:18.458 --> 53:21.375
Tell me what can you do to make it okay

53:21.458 --> 53:24.541
To make it look
Like you don't wanna be like them

53:24.625 --> 53:27.916
You can hate or you can not

53:29.333 --> 53:33.916
In the end you still wanna be
At the same spot

53:34.000 --> 53:36.166
That's anyway got no meaning

53:36.250 --> 53:38.833
The only thing that joins them is
What they're dealing

53:38.958 --> 53:41.541
Trust me you're better off
You're gonna get nothing

53:42.125 --> 53:44.583
GĞµt nothing

53:45.833 --> 53:48.416
I wait one second and I buy me timĞµ

53:48.500 --> 53:51.250
Looking everywhere
Checking are you looking fine

53:51.333 --> 53:53.958
There's no pressure
Oh yeah, yeah, sure

53:54.041 --> 53:56.458
I'd love to believe that's how I feel

53:56.541 --> 53:59.041
Sitting in the corner
Waiting for your white line

53:59.125 --> 54:02.000
Thinking all about it
Do you really feel fine?

54:02.083 --> 54:04.500
There's no pressure
Oh yeah, yeah, sure

54:04.583 --> 54:07.250
I'd love to believe that's just how I feel

54:11.333 --> 54:13.916
That's just how I feel

54:16.875 --> 54:19.166
That's just how I feel

54:20.083 --> 54:24.458
How I feel
That's just how I feel

54:25.041 --> 54:28.458
That's just, that's just how I

55:00.833 --> 55:03.625
Are you a cool kid?
Are you a cute kid?

55:03.708 --> 55:05.958
Do you fit in?
And do they like it?

55:06.041 --> 55:08.833
Tell me what can you do to make it okay

55:09.416 --> 55:12.166
To make it look
Like you don't wanna be like them

55:12.250 --> 55:14.333
Cool kid?
Are you a cute kid?

55:14.416 --> 55:17.041
Do you fit in?
And do they like it?

55:17.166 --> 55:20.041
Tell me what can you do to make it okay

55:20.125 --> 55:22.875
To make it look
Like you don't wanna be like them

55:23.541 --> 55:24.541
No!

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
Happy birthday.

55:44.375 --> 55:46.666
Wow, Neil! You got her a Gucci?

55:48.125 --> 55:49.208
Nice, isn't it?

55:49.791 --> 55:51.708
It's super nice.

55:51.791 --> 55:54.416
Wow, Neil. You've outdone yourself.

55:55.416 --> 55:57.375
I wanted the black one.

55:57.458 --> 55:58.375
-Yes?
-Yeah.

55:59.500 --> 56:02.375
Also, tell me
when you guys are ready for dinner.

56:02.458 --> 56:03.958
Yeah, it's all ready, soâ€¦

56:04.750 --> 56:07.791
-Where are the others?
-I wanted to keep it intimate.

56:08.541 --> 56:11.458
-This intimate?
-Yes.

56:12.416 --> 56:14.083
Sweet of you to include us.

56:14.166 --> 56:15.833
Of course, darling.

56:17.833 --> 56:18.666
Catch!

56:22.500 --> 56:23.708
-Raunak.
-Huh?

56:23.791 --> 56:25.125
-Candids.
-Yes.

56:25.208 --> 56:30.375
Okay, guys, let's pretend
to have some fun! Come.

56:31.125 --> 56:32.291
-Oh my God.
-Okay.

56:33.500 --> 56:35.166
You'll give this to me?

56:35.791 --> 56:37.250
-Birthday present.
-Okay.

56:40.416 --> 56:41.333
Really?

56:42.208 --> 56:44.750
-Say Dior!
-Dior.

56:45.750 --> 56:47.791
Raunak does most of my shoots.

56:49.083 --> 56:51.666
By the way, you two are quite cute.

56:52.541 --> 56:54.041
Why aren't you dating?

56:54.125 --> 56:55.333
She's out of my league,

56:55.416 --> 56:57.708
but I was hoping
if you had other friends here,

56:57.791 --> 56:59.625
I could've been introduced to them.

56:59.708 --> 57:01.291
-My influencer gang?
-Yeah.

57:02.666 --> 57:03.750
Please.

57:03.833 --> 57:07.000
They were just using me
to bump up their followers.

57:07.583 --> 57:11.375
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, so they were canceled for tonight.

57:12.666 --> 57:14.791
Neil's following has also shot up.

57:15.375 --> 57:16.416
Is he using you too?

57:17.000 --> 57:18.958
No. Not him.

57:19.041 --> 57:21.250
-But that's how most people are.
-Imaad, stop it.

57:21.333 --> 57:24.708
The moment you become famous,
people just stop acting normal.

57:24.791 --> 57:27.041
And what's normal, according to you?

57:28.375 --> 57:29.208
Excuse me?

57:35.916 --> 57:39.041
Happy birthday to you

57:45.666 --> 57:47.958
-Raunak.
-Smile.

57:50.416 --> 57:51.833
-You wanna get the plates?
-Come.

57:51.916 --> 57:53.125
-Tissues as well.
-Yeah.

57:53.666 --> 57:55.583
-Nice.
-Raunak.

57:57.291 --> 58:00.250
-Delete that last picture.
-This one?

58:01.333 --> 58:02.541
-Okay.
-Nice.

58:02.625 --> 58:04.416
Imaad Ali!

58:10.541 --> 58:12.916
Thank you, guys, thank you.

58:14.708 --> 58:17.666
There are three things in life
I can't wrap my head around.

58:18.166 --> 58:22.250
The possibility of life on Mars.
The size of Jupiter.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.500
And the existence of

58:25.041 --> 58:25.875
influencers.

58:27.750 --> 58:29.708
I hope there are no influencers here.

58:29.791 --> 58:31.500
Perfect, let's do this!

58:33.291 --> 58:36.250
What sort of a profession is this?
What will their kids say at school?

58:36.333 --> 58:40.500
Back in the day, "Ma'am, my dad's
the CEO of a multinational company."

58:41.083 --> 58:42.208
And now, twenty years later,

58:42.291 --> 58:45.041
"Ma'am, my dad makes dance reels
and sells soap on Instagram."

58:45.791 --> 58:48.750
"Use promo code Foam20 to get 20% off."

58:52.791 --> 58:55.291
I have a friend
who's dating a real big influencer.

58:55.875 --> 58:58.708
Which isâ€¦ I'm happy for him.

59:00.833 --> 59:05.000
But I think she's so out of his league
that it looks like a paid partnership.

59:06.500 --> 59:09.583
She doesn't scream in bed,
she gives him a shoutout.

59:11.166 --> 59:12.791
She doesn't say, "Say my name."

59:12.875 --> 59:15.291
She goes, "Like, share and subscribe."

59:18.833 --> 59:21.458
She doesn't want him to find the G-spot.

59:21.541 --> 59:23.541
She wants him to press the bell icon.

59:28.166 --> 59:31.625
I mean people have
used the Internet to cause revolutions.

59:31.708 --> 59:32.958
And this madam is all,

59:33.041 --> 59:36.666
"Hey, guys. I'm off to the Maldives
to chill at my exotic beachside villa."

59:36.750 --> 59:39.750
"But keep enjoying the petty pleasures
of your middle-class life."

59:39.833 --> 59:43.708
"And keep dreaming of those vacations
you can't afford. Toodles!"

59:43.791 --> 59:45.291
"Toodles!" I love it.

59:50.916 --> 59:54.125
Don't get me wrong. My problem is not
that she went to Maldives.

59:54.208 --> 59:55.833
It's that she came back.

59:58.666 --> 01:00:02.500
My friend, her so-called boyfriend,
used to be her gym trainer.

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.416
Which is funny

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:11.458
because now they're both working out,
but their relationship is not.

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:16.083
-It's a joke.
-Yeah.

01:00:16.166 --> 01:00:19.083
He seems less like a boyfriend,
more like an unpaid intern.

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:22.958
The thing is, she doesn't
publicly acknowledge their relationship.

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:26.708
Because apparently, she needs
to look single and attainable.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.541
I told my friend, "It's okay.
Let the relationship be a secret."

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:35.416
"She gets to keep her followers,
and you get to keep your self-respect."

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.791
But I'm very happy for him.

01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:41.250
Actually, I'm genuinely
very happy for him.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:43.750
He may not find love or respect,

01:00:43.833 --> 01:00:46.458
but at least he gets
a 20% discount on soap.

01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:02.291
So, give it up for our next performance!

01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:05.708
We have our own Backstreet Boys
from Bandra.

01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:07.250
Magik with a K.

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:14.291
My clothes are ruined.

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:19.583
Yo! How was it?

01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:22.375
Give me a smoke.

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.041
Don't tell me you're offended.

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:32.500
That stuff was personal.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:35.583
I told you these things in private.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:40.333
-Did I take your name?
-That's not the point.

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:43.166
Is this what you think of me?

01:01:44.791 --> 01:01:47.166
-Dude, it was a joke.
-It wasn't funny.

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:49.958
It was insulting.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:54.541
You were humiliating me, bro.
In front of everyone.

01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:57.041
It wasn't an insult but an exaggeration.
A humorous take.

01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:58.291
On my life?

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:02.708
Say whatever you want
about me or my relationships,

01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:04.750
but say it to my face.

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:09.291
Relationship? I didn't know
you were in a relationship.

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:15.125
What do you mean?
What do-- What do you mean?

01:02:16.291 --> 01:02:19.458
Maybe you can't see it,
but Lala isn't serious about you, bro.

01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:22.416
-Oh my God!
-But again that's just my opinion.

01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:27.041
So you also have an opinion
about what Lala thinks?

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:28.000
Bro, youâ€¦

01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:32.791
You behaved like an asshole at her house,

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.541
and I didn't say anything.

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:35.791
-I'm sorry.
-I let it go.

01:02:35.916 --> 01:02:39.333
I'm sorry if that's how you felt
but I had no such intention. Okay?

01:02:39.416 --> 01:02:42.291
As for today's show,
I'm a comedian, I say what I see.

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:43.625
-So it's like that?
-Yes.

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:45.375
There's such a thing as confidence.

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:48.333
If you can't take a joke,
why are you here? Stay in the gym.

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:55.583
Stop it, guys! What are you doing, Neil?

01:02:56.791 --> 01:02:57.958
What did you say?

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:01.083
Just because you're investing in the gym

01:03:01.166 --> 01:03:03.458
doesn't mean you can say
whatever you want.

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:04.833
We're not your servants.

01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:07.083
-What's the connection?
-There is one.

01:03:08.666 --> 01:03:10.083
I lack confidence?

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:13.250
Bro, whatever I've done, I did on my own.

01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:15.041
Don't live off my father like him.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:17.958
-Neil.
-Entitled prick!

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:21.875
You say what you see?
Can't you see the things you do?

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:25.250
-That's enough. Stop it.
-Talk about your Tinder mania!

01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:28.958
He can't handle
the slightest bit of intimacy.

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:33.625
You're emotionally stunted, bro!

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:36.625
You're a sex addict. Get it?

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:39.958
Joke about that! That could be hilarious.

01:03:40.541 --> 01:03:43.166
Who knows? Maybe it'll
get you a special on Netflix.

01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:59.125
Bro, we should pitch this to Netflix.
This shit is killer.

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:03.208
She doesn't say, "Say my name."
She goes, "Like, share and subscribe."

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:05.625
She doesn't--

01:05:05.708 --> 01:05:07.041
Give me a towel.

01:05:07.541 --> 01:05:08.458
It's cold.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.000
You said he wasn't home.

01:05:22.666 --> 01:05:23.541
I lied.

01:05:25.791 --> 01:05:27.791
-Neil.
-Just grow up, man!

01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:36.750
How long will you not talk to each other?
We're starting a business.

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:39.000
If we don't pay the deposit,
we'll lose the space.

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:42.291
I have no problem with the business.
Please rent the place.

01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:45.416
So talk to him then. Yes?

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.000
He told me to return your money.

01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:50.708
-He wants to pitch it to a client.
-Dude, he hit me!

01:05:52.083 --> 01:05:53.708
And I'm supposed to talk to him?

01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:57.125
I've quit my job, Imaad!

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.583
Go, tell him that.

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:11.625
Here you are.

01:06:12.125 --> 01:06:13.166
This is Ashley.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.458
He'll fill your position.

01:06:16.666 --> 01:06:17.541
So excited.

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:21.166
You can start the handover.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:23.708
Come.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.625
It was knee-length. Now it's ankle-length.
Now it's a balloon on your toes.

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:35.541
Don't wear it.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.041
-Knock, dude!
-What is this?

01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:33.583
-Got a pool in your bathroom now?
-Shut up.

01:07:33.666 --> 01:07:36.000
You get back from work
and you put on a bikini.

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:42.791
It's for Rohan, yeah?

01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:46.041
I'm doing it for myself.

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:49.958
I saw his comment.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.333
I'm just having fun.

01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:54.791
You want to have fun?

01:07:56.208 --> 01:08:00.041
"Loves to travel?" No. "Wanderlust?"

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:03.666
Dude, I'm not Tinderella type.

01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:08.500
Chill! Don't go to his on the first date.
Meet in a bar or a restaurant.

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:11.125
But your first dates always come here.

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:14.208
Lucky for them I'm a gentleman.

01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:17.000
Okay.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:18.875
No.

01:08:18.958 --> 01:08:20.791
Yes. Nice.

01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:25.083
Zeeshan looks quite interesting.

01:08:25.958 --> 01:08:27.375
What a nice guy!

01:08:27.458 --> 01:08:29.500
Look! Zeeshan with a puppy.

01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:33.583
Zeeshan with a baby. You rented it?

01:08:34.166 --> 01:08:36.250
Done? Strike left now.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.583
What are you doing on Tinder?

01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:46.250
I thought you liked Simran.

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.208
Yes.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.125
I know you like Simran.

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:54.041
Delete it.

01:08:57.833 --> 01:08:58.958
Cute.

01:09:05.666 --> 01:09:08.416
"Ram Singh, I'm going to be
the mother of your child!"

01:09:09.791 --> 01:09:12.166
I would never have assumed
you liked such films.

01:09:12.708 --> 01:09:14.958
When did I say I liked it?

01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:18.250
You didn't have to.
You were laughing the loudest.

01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:22.333
This whole act
of you being a serious artist,

01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:24.750
I think I get it.

01:09:25.416 --> 01:09:27.541
"You're the only one who really knows me."

01:09:38.125 --> 01:09:39.500
Did you talk to Neil?

01:09:41.125 --> 01:09:42.000
No.

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:48.791
Do you think you avoid intimacy?

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:53.333
I was using Tinder just for fun.
I didn't overthink it.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:02.166
You thought I am avoiding intimacy?

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:04.125
I just wanted the popcorn.

01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:23.208
Let me stay in your arms

01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:32.791
Just for a little longer

01:10:35.875 --> 01:10:39.750
How I wish

01:10:40.833 --> 01:10:44.583
The tide of this drunken moment

01:10:45.833 --> 01:10:51.916
Pulls me in and I lose myself

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.791
In your arms

01:11:04.666 --> 01:11:06.833
In your arms

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.750
This is the five-year projection.
With worst and best-case scenarios.

01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:30.000
You memorized the entire presentation?

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.333
It lacks vision. It feels very limited.

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:37.375
It needs to be more commercial.
Scale it up, please.

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:41.583
If we scale it up,
the space won't be premium anymore.

01:11:41.666 --> 01:11:42.666
Exactly.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:46.458
Based on per square foot value, our model
is better and we can expand over time.

01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:50.458
So you weren't wasting time
at the gym then?

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:53.416
No. I was recruiting talent.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:54.916
Okay.

01:11:58.291 --> 01:11:59.833
What will their kids say at school?

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:04.041
Back in the day, we went, "Ma'am,
my dad's a multinational company CEO."

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:09.208
Twenty years later, "Ma'am, my dad makes
dance reels and sells soap on Instagram."

01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:13.583
"Use promo code Foam20 to get 20% off."

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:20.333
I have a friend

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:23.666
who's dating an influencer.

01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:28.041
I thought she's so out of his league
that it's a paid partnership.

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:34.833
She doesn't scream in bed,
she gives him a shoutout.

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:36.958
She doesn'tâ€¦

01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:46.375
Anywayâ€¦

01:12:46.875 --> 01:12:48.791
Remember when the Internet was new?

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:51.625
We thought, wow, it's an encyclopedia.

01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.458
The world is at our fingertips.

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:55.958
This will change humanity.

01:12:56.541 --> 01:13:01.250
Now every twenty minutes,
all night long, we watch videos.

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:08.375
Where's the punchline, bro?

01:13:08.916 --> 01:13:11.000
-Okayâ€¦
-How about an actual joke, man?

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:16.083
Guys, please welcome back our host,
Rebecca, for the evening. Thank you.

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:21.333
Imaad.

01:13:21.416 --> 01:13:23.333
Hey, guys! Give it up for Imaad.

01:13:23.416 --> 01:13:24.291
Imaad.

01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:28.333
Imaad!

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:33.000
-Why didn't you finish the set?
-I'm not doing this one anymore.

01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:36.750
Not doing it? This set killed that night.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:39.708
People specifically called
to watch this set.

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.625
I'll write another one. Better than this.

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.000
-Bandra?
-Yes, get in.

01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:49.958
-Imaad, I've pitched this to Netflix.
-Melbun, forget this set.

01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:54.791
This is insane. If you won't listen to me,
I can't manage you anymore.

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:57.708
Strange fellow. Doesn't even react.

01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:01.625
-Let's go.
-Take him away.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.875
Curl back your shoulders. Relax.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.625
-I'll have abs by this evening?
-By this afternoon.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.500
-Listen.
-Yeah?

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:19.791
We're still discussing your gym.

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:20.916
Take your time.

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:23.208
-I'll see you.
-Good work, lad.

01:14:23.833 --> 01:14:25.000
No cheating! Eat clean.

01:14:25.083 --> 01:14:25.958
I'll try.

01:14:31.833 --> 01:14:32.958
Yo, Harsh.

01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:34.875
-Where are you?
-Pali Hill.

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:35.791
Head to Juhu.

01:14:35.875 --> 01:14:38.000
There's a session with Malaika.
I can't go.

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:39.708
Done, great.

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:42.541
And, Neil, stop posting photos with her.

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:44.916
She's not your client. It's tacky, bro.

01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:23.708
Ahana, tell me something.

01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:27.458
What's a pretty, smart corporate
consultant like you doing on Tinder?

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:32.291
Exactly what a cute, polite
investment banker like you is doing.

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:35.708
-Enjoy your drink.
-Thanks.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.333
You think I'm cute?

01:15:38.916 --> 01:15:42.208
I thought flattery might stop
your line of questioning.

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:44.041
Okay.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.291
Can I have your hand?

01:15:48.375 --> 01:15:51.125
Yeah. Just to the right.

01:15:52.625 --> 01:15:53.625
Perfect.

01:16:04.458 --> 01:16:07.041
You're an event planner.
You have your own company.

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:09.791
Your dog's called Jackie,
very imaginative.

01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:13.833
You run marathons at 5:00 a.m. because
apparently you hate having a good time.

01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:17.083
Yeah, I'm hating this.

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:22.750
You're a good listener.

01:16:24.291 --> 01:16:25.625
I'm a better kisser.

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:34.916
Lala, I was thinking

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.750
I should have
one of those bouldering walls on the side.

01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:40.916
You know, I haven't seen
anything like that here.

01:16:41.541 --> 01:16:43.000
Feel like it could work.

01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:46.916
Mumbai just doesn't have any space.

01:16:49.625 --> 01:16:52.125
Did you actually read the pdf I sent you?

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:57.125
Of course! There's no space
for a wallpaper, yeah?

01:17:00.291 --> 01:17:01.458
No, butâ€¦

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:11.208
Who are you texting?

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:13.416
Nobody.

01:17:15.708 --> 01:17:17.791
You go out on a lot of dates?

01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:20.000
You?

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:23.916
Not really.
In fact, I recently downloaded Tinder.

01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:27.875
Actually, I just broke up
a couple months back.

01:17:28.916 --> 01:17:29.750
What happened?

01:17:29.833 --> 01:17:33.583
Honestly, I don't know.
Nothing ever happened.

01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:34.750
You know?

01:17:36.625 --> 01:17:38.875
-Nothing ever happened?
-No, I mean--

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:42.000
-Did you do anything to reignite it?
-No, it's not thatâ€¦

01:17:42.083 --> 01:17:45.666
Or as you bankers might say, to reposition
towards an upward trajectory.

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:48.500
Can I get the dessert menu, please?

01:17:49.291 --> 01:17:52.000
I just let you marinate
Now I love the taste

01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:53.750
Come here, come here
Come here, baby

01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:56.750
It's the way that I'm attached
Got me good and got me fast

01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:59.208
You a real catch
Can you, can you, can you blame me?

01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:02.166
Dreamin' bout you like a creep

01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:04.708
What the hell you want from me?

01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:07.541
What the hell you want from me now?

01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:08.666
Morning, lad.

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:13.958
Any update on our gym proposal?

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.083
Did you use the shower yesterday?

01:18:17.041 --> 01:18:17.875
Yes.

01:18:18.666 --> 01:18:21.500
I had a session with Malaika Arora,
I had to freshen up.

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:22.666
Have you done this before?

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:26.875
-No. Never. I meanâ€¦
-There's a sign here.

01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:30.250
Staff not allowed. A strict policy.

01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:32.333
I'm your personal trainer, man.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.916
Neil, the society has
asked me to fire you.

01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:37.333
I talked them out of it this time.

01:18:38.625 --> 01:18:40.291
Please don't cross the line, bro.

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:42.666
Come on.

01:18:54.375 --> 01:18:55.625
Home early today?

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:05.416
What is it?

01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:07.958
-Can't you knock?
-What happened?

01:19:08.041 --> 01:19:09.250
Must something happen?

01:19:09.916 --> 01:19:10.791
Give me some privacy.

01:19:12.958 --> 01:19:15.041
-And please knock!
-Okay.

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.833
Baby, flip your hair back. Amazing!

01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:35.125
Now show me that sexy jawline.

01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:37.416
You look like a Victoria's Secret model.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.291
Dude, that's hot. That's really hot.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:42.833
Lift that bottle up.
Fuck, you're killing me.

01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:45.000
-You're killing me!
-Stop it.

01:20:45.791 --> 01:20:47.375
Look over there and do it.

01:20:47.458 --> 01:20:49.500
You look like a fucking mermaid.

01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:51.708
Take a sip from the bottle.
Hold it closer.

01:20:51.833 --> 01:20:53.166
Give me a second, please.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.625
-Wanna check this out till then?
-Sure.

01:20:57.708 --> 01:20:58.833
Gorgeous.

01:20:59.416 --> 01:21:00.250
Hi.

01:21:01.708 --> 01:21:03.916
-What are you doing here?
-You weren't taking my calls.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.166
And I saw on your story
that you were here.

01:21:06.916 --> 01:21:07.750
I'm working.

01:21:10.083 --> 01:21:12.291
-What happened?
-Nothing. I just wanted to talk.

01:21:12.375 --> 01:21:13.250
Now?

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:16.958
What's he doing here?

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:22.250
I'm promoting his gin. Remember?

01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:24.583
Lala, we're losing light.

01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:26.125
Coming.

01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:28.125
You carry on. We'll talk later.

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:30.708
-I have booze to sell.
-Yeah.

01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:32.625
I'm so sorry, guys.

01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:34.250
It's okay.

01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:36.625
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:39.208
Look over there.

01:21:40.875 --> 01:21:42.375
Have you spoken to Ashish?

01:21:44.625 --> 01:21:46.583
Yeah, they're looking into their finances.

01:21:50.041 --> 01:21:52.666
We found such a nice space.
We're gonna lose it.

01:21:53.166 --> 01:21:55.083
And the money's lying in the account.

01:21:55.166 --> 01:21:57.166
You guys are being so stupid.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:00.375
-You know what he did, right?
-But you pushed him too!

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.333
It's happened. It's done.

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:03.916
So you won't speak forever?

01:22:05.208 --> 01:22:07.291
I quit my job for you guys.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:10.500
I know.

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:14.833
So, drop this shit, or explain
to my parents why I'm unemployed.

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:19.500
-I'll talk to Imaad.
-What? Say that again.

01:22:20.125 --> 01:22:23.750
I said I'll talk to Imaad.
We're meeting on your birthday anyway.

01:22:24.333 --> 01:22:25.250
Thank you. Bye.

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.125
Fight over.

01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:30.500
Bye.

01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:35.000
I'll sleep on the couch.
Mom and Dad can stay in my room.

01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:37.958
Ultimately, I always end up on the couch.

01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:40.125
You're going to Simran's?

01:22:40.958 --> 01:22:45.041
-Yes.
-Live-in relationship.

01:22:45.125 --> 01:22:46.208
It's just three days.

01:22:46.333 --> 01:22:49.625
That's how it goes, bro.
First three days, then three months.

01:22:49.708 --> 01:22:51.333
Then straight to thirty years.

01:22:52.875 --> 01:22:54.250
I'm proud of you!

01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:07.458
Where are we now?
How did we get here?

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:13.875
These deep blue nights
In endless hues

01:23:13.958 --> 01:23:20.166
I lose myself in things you do

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:26.916
I'm lost, I wonder where I am

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I lose myself in things you do

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:38.166
Can someone tell me where I am?

01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:43.458
Let yourself go

01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:45.500
Let yourself go

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:51.916
I lose myself in things you do

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.500
I really like you.

01:23:57.875 --> 01:23:58.875
I like you too.

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:04.791
The magic that is me and you

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:10.291
I'm lost, I wonder where I am

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:17.458
I lose myself in things you do

01:24:19.208 --> 01:24:25.041
Can someone tell me where I am?

01:24:26.541 --> 01:24:28.000
It's so hot!

01:24:28.083 --> 01:24:29.541
Thank God, we've reached.

01:24:31.541 --> 01:24:34.333
Sweetie, please turn
the air conditioner on.

01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:36.916
Mom, we've just reached.
Can you give me one minute?

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:40.458
Yeah, but this humidity
is just intolerable.

01:24:40.541 --> 01:24:42.916
Of course, Ma.
I called you here to torture you.

01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.291
The real one or the fake one?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
She's a lovely girl.

01:25:12.916 --> 01:25:16.208
-You two an item?
-Who says item, bro?

01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:17.833
I'm not your bro, I'm your dad.

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:21.041
-Yeah, "item."
-Is she your girlfriend?

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:23.666
I don't know.

01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:27.375
Good enough.

01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:30.416
I'm happy, Imaad.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.708
Therapy is really helping.

01:25:35.375 --> 01:25:38.083
I was afraid
you'd never trust people again.

01:25:38.625 --> 01:25:40.125
-Because of me.
-Dad, please.

01:25:42.333 --> 01:25:45.666
-I should've protected you, Imaad.
-Dad, go easy on the rum.

01:26:21.208 --> 01:26:23.166
-Done with the Zoom call?
-Yes.

01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:27.166
I made butter chicken and kebabs.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.541
Is Meher a vegetarian?

01:26:48.041 --> 01:26:49.750
-Hello.
-Happy birthday.

01:26:50.791 --> 01:26:51.791
You know it's tomorrow.

01:26:52.458 --> 01:26:54.291
So I'll call again tomorrow.

01:26:55.583 --> 01:26:57.125
So, what's your scene?

01:26:57.625 --> 01:26:59.708
Chill. Dinner at Izumi.

01:27:00.208 --> 01:27:01.208
Izumi?

01:27:02.958 --> 01:27:04.458
That was our spot.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Who you going with?

01:27:07.916 --> 01:27:10.125
Why? Why do you want to know?

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:12.166
No, I justâ€¦

01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:21.000
A toast to all of you!

01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:24.625
You've been together since boarding school
and now business partners.

01:27:25.833 --> 01:27:27.791
Always be together like this. Be happy.

01:27:27.875 --> 01:27:30.083
To your friendship. To the Jungle Gym!

01:27:30.166 --> 01:27:32.541
-To the Jungle Gym!
-And to my free workouts.

01:27:32.625 --> 01:27:34.958
Cheers.

01:27:35.041 --> 01:27:37.958
Wish you all lots of happiness,
lots of success.

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:41.208
Aunty, I'll check.

01:27:41.291 --> 01:27:42.750
-Thank you.
-No worries.

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:44.833
-It's damn good.
-The butter chicken is amazing.

01:27:44.916 --> 01:27:47.541
-We need to figure how to get it here.
-So learn it.

01:27:48.125 --> 01:27:51.416
-Teach Imaad how to make it.
-Wow! Who sent this?

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.875
Red roses, Ahana.

01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:56.666
It says, "From Rohan."

01:27:58.125 --> 01:27:59.208
Sweet of him.

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:04.041
Why's he sending you red roses now?

01:28:04.875 --> 01:28:06.083
He broke up with you, no?

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:08.250
He freaked out.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.625
He thought we'd be engaged soon,
but he wasn't ready for marriage.

01:28:13.208 --> 01:28:14.916
And this new girl is just a rebound.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.375
But you're intelligent.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Why take on the pressure of marriage?

01:28:21.875 --> 01:28:23.708
There's so much more to life.

01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:28.000
Marriage isn't some joyride.

01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:30.416
Meaning?

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.208
Aren't you happy with Papa?

01:28:34.416 --> 01:28:36.750
No, it's not that.

01:28:38.916 --> 01:28:39.958
I'm just bored.

01:28:58.208 --> 01:29:00.458
So basically, you've dated
all these people?

01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:03.416
Yes, of course.
I'm a con artist, remember?

01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:10.208
They're beautiful.

01:29:10.291 --> 01:29:11.333
Thanks.

01:29:20.458 --> 01:29:22.791
But there's an emptiness to them too.

01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:23.916
Yeah.

01:29:24.708 --> 01:29:26.041
It's the digital age.

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:28.916
We may feel we're more connected,

01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:32.333
but we've never been lonelier.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.208
Ahana's calling.

01:29:36.291 --> 01:29:37.791
I'll call her back.

01:30:01.791 --> 01:30:03.291
You're still on Tinder?

01:30:09.458 --> 01:30:11.125
I was going to delete it.

01:30:13.083 --> 01:30:14.541
You were seeing other people.

01:30:19.458 --> 01:30:21.500
I'm sorry. Obviously it's wrong.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.041
I don't think I can do this.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.125
I want to be with someone
who wants to be with me.

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:35.166
I don't want to wonder
what's real, what's not.

01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:37.541
-I'm not 25.
-But I want to be with you.

01:30:39.083 --> 01:30:41.416
You don't know what you want.

01:30:42.458 --> 01:30:44.583
Listen, this is just stupid, okay?

01:30:44.708 --> 01:30:46.583
-It means nothing.
-Why do it then?

01:30:54.666 --> 01:30:55.666
You need to leave.

01:31:25.416 --> 01:31:26.375
Ahana.

01:31:28.375 --> 01:31:30.708
Where were you? We're getting late.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.291
Aisha's sangeet.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.708
You must come too.
Richie uncle would like that.

01:31:43.583 --> 01:31:44.791
I won't get an off.

01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:47.500
Nothing's happening with your gym anyway.

01:31:48.208 --> 01:31:49.208
It's happening.

01:31:51.208 --> 01:31:52.541
You're looking handsome.

01:31:54.666 --> 01:31:56.125
When are y'all leaving?

01:31:56.208 --> 01:31:59.375
-Our train leaves the day after.
-You're taking the train again?

01:32:01.083 --> 01:32:03.666
Why aren't you flying? There isn't
much difference in the price.

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:04.708
There is a difference.

01:32:05.291 --> 01:32:07.666
We're going in an AC compartment.
It's fine.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.000
For you maybe. You asked Mama?

01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:12.958
-I don't have a problem, thank you.
-Thank you.

01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:19.083
Can't you spend a little more?
How long must you live like this?

01:32:20.708 --> 01:32:21.583
Why?

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.625
What do we lack?

01:32:33.083 --> 01:32:34.125
Everything, Dad.

01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:38.291
You have nothing. You don't have a life.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:42.208
You drive the same old car,
live in the same crappy house.

01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:47.333
When was the last time
you took Mama out for dinner?

01:32:54.208 --> 01:32:55.833
I'll be late. I have the keys.

01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:06.833
The number you have dialed is
currently busy.

01:33:06.916 --> 01:33:08.583
Please try again--

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:12.875
Hey, Lala, where are you?

01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:14.791
Do I pick you up or not?

01:33:15.875 --> 01:33:17.166
Just let me know, okay?

01:33:20.333 --> 01:33:21.250
Fuck.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:28.416
Wow, from where did you steal that saree?

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.666
Heaven.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.541
-What's up, bro?
-Same shit, bro.

01:33:38.208 --> 01:33:40.500
Very fake. Start again.

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:42.208
Shots.

01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:45.625
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

01:33:45.708 --> 01:33:46.750
Here you go.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:52.833
Yeah.

01:33:53.583 --> 01:33:54.750
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

01:33:54.833 --> 01:33:55.958
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

01:34:02.166 --> 01:34:05.916
Going to the bathroom.
Please try not to kill each other. Okay?

01:34:09.625 --> 01:34:10.708
So?

01:34:11.625 --> 01:34:13.458
Come over to the bar.

01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:15.250
The one at the back.

01:34:15.333 --> 01:34:18.291
Yeah. Okay, I'll see you there.

01:34:19.583 --> 01:34:20.708
Simran?

01:34:20.791 --> 01:34:22.416
No. Tinder date.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.208
You brought a random Tinder date
to Aisha's sangeet?

01:34:25.291 --> 01:34:26.250
Yeah, so?

01:34:29.583 --> 01:34:32.083
So, nothing. I'm just surprised
you're still on Tinder.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:33.833
Why? I'm a sex addict, right?

01:34:35.708 --> 01:34:37.000
-Imaad? Hi!
-Hey!

01:34:37.083 --> 01:34:39.041
-You finally made it.
-Of course.

01:34:40.666 --> 01:34:42.500
Come, I'll make you meet my friends.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.708
Are you ignoring me?

01:34:57.416 --> 01:34:58.750
I'm giving you space.

01:35:01.625 --> 01:35:03.375
Where's Buttercup Butterfly?

01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.416
Not here.

01:35:06.541 --> 01:35:09.583
Where are your bodyguards, Jai and Veeru?

01:35:11.625 --> 01:35:13.000
Stay clear of Neil.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:16.250
Why? Will he hit me with a dumbbell?

01:35:17.041 --> 01:35:18.833
You should've been a psychic.

01:35:21.541 --> 01:35:23.458
So, what have you been up to?

01:35:23.916 --> 01:35:25.375
What do you care?

01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:26.416
Listen.

01:35:28.875 --> 01:35:29.791
I'm sorry.

01:35:34.333 --> 01:35:37.333
I handled things badly.

01:35:40.166 --> 01:35:41.041
You did.

01:35:48.708 --> 01:35:50.416
Let's get a drink?

01:35:56.666 --> 01:35:57.833
Let's get many.

01:36:11.875 --> 01:36:14.416
-Remember this song?
-Obviously.

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:17.500
Let's dance?

01:36:19.958 --> 01:36:23.083
So many lovers have made sacrifices

01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:26.083
So many have perished

01:36:26.166 --> 01:36:28.666
This game is notorious

01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:32.375
Flaunting false dreams

01:36:32.833 --> 01:36:37.458
Love makes you dance
On shards of broken glass

01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:41.375
It torments you all night

01:36:41.458 --> 01:36:44.125
Not a moment of peace

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:50.250
Love makes you dance
On shards of broken glass

01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:54.250
People with their masks

01:36:54.833 --> 01:36:57.125
Locked in cages

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.291
Make some excuse

01:37:00.375 --> 01:37:03.375
To escape imprisonment

01:37:03.458 --> 01:37:05.791
Don't look at me

01:37:05.875 --> 01:37:08.750
Your eyes show
I no longer know who I amâ€¦

01:37:09.541 --> 01:37:10.791
Hi, my cuties.

01:37:10.875 --> 01:37:14.333
Lala's back and so is the sake.

01:37:14.416 --> 01:37:15.291
Hey.

01:37:15.375 --> 01:37:17.958
So many lovers have made sacrifices

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:21.583
So many have perished

01:37:21.666 --> 01:37:24.333
This game is notorious

01:37:24.416 --> 01:37:28.208
Flaunting false dreams

01:37:28.291 --> 01:37:33.958
Love makes you dance
On shards of broken glass

01:37:34.041 --> 01:37:36.541
I swear, it's tormenting

01:37:36.625 --> 01:37:39.875
Not a moment of peace

01:37:41.166 --> 01:37:43.625
How to stay awake at night?

01:37:44.416 --> 01:37:46.583
How to escape the self?

01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:51.083
I have read
You get love in exchange for love

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:54.666
My friends ask
How long will I keep losing?

01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:56.583
The chasm widens

01:37:56.666 --> 01:37:59.250
Can't get close to anyone

01:37:59.333 --> 01:38:04.708
Love makes you dance
On shards of broken glass

01:38:04.791 --> 01:38:07.333
It torments you all night

01:38:07.416 --> 01:38:10.791
Not a moment of peace

01:38:10.875 --> 01:38:14.958
Countless lovers have made sacrifices

01:38:24.541 --> 01:38:27.500
Countless lovers have made sacrifices

01:38:27.583 --> 01:38:30.833
So many have perished

01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:33.500
This game is notorious

01:38:33.583 --> 01:38:37.625
Flaunting false dreams

01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:41.750
Love makes you dance
On shards of broken glass

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:45.791
It torments you all night

01:38:45.875 --> 01:38:49.916
Not a moment of peace

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.375
Love makes you dance
On shards of broken glass

01:38:54.458 --> 01:38:57.541
Love makes you drunk
Punishes both

01:38:57.625 --> 01:38:59.708
Couldn't share, got in a fix

01:38:59.791 --> 01:39:03.791
Bottled the reason, the pain
Can't bite the feeding hand

01:39:03.875 --> 01:39:07.041
We had something special
Now we're far apart

01:39:07.125 --> 01:39:09.458
Now to live more, promise less

01:39:09.541 --> 01:39:12.625
Change myself
And the me I was with you

01:39:12.708 --> 01:39:15.583
This chess game has new colors

01:39:15.666 --> 01:39:18.333
I learned as I watched my love walk away

01:39:18.416 --> 01:39:21.083
So many lovers have made sacrifices

01:39:21.666 --> 01:39:24.166
So many have perished

01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:27.375
So many lovers have made sacrifices

01:39:27.958 --> 01:39:30.541
So many have perished

01:39:30.625 --> 01:39:33.333
This game is notorious

01:39:33.416 --> 01:39:36.250
Flaunting false dreams

01:39:37.083 --> 01:39:39.708
I swear, it's tormenting

01:39:39.791 --> 01:39:42.625
Not a moment of peace

01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:57.750
Lala.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:39:59.833
Neil?

01:40:03.083 --> 01:40:05.208
-What the hell?
-Yeah, what the hell, man?

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:09.041
You were to come with me to the party
last night. You just ghosted me.

01:40:12.125 --> 01:40:13.333
I didn't ghost you.

01:40:23.833 --> 01:40:25.208
I saw your post.

01:40:30.250 --> 01:40:34.041
I was going to talk to you.
It just kinda happened.

01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:38.583
It just happened and you are putting up
posts about it? With hearts on them.

01:40:40.416 --> 01:40:41.708
You kissed him, Lala.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:48.875
Will you say something?

01:40:56.791 --> 01:40:57.750
Let's talk now.

01:40:58.708 --> 01:41:00.083
What's there to talk about?

01:41:01.208 --> 01:41:05.208
I get it. He's Kartik Seth. His family
owns distilleries all over India.

01:41:06.083 --> 01:41:09.083
And he's great for your profile, right?
Isn't that it?

01:41:10.333 --> 01:41:11.875
We aren't a couple, Neil.

01:41:16.041 --> 01:41:18.416
Look at me. No, listen, look at me.

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:19.500
What are we then?

01:41:21.333 --> 01:41:23.291
Why did you ask me
to stay over all the time?

01:41:23.375 --> 01:41:25.083
You took me to Maldives with you.

01:41:25.583 --> 01:41:28.333
Why invite my friends
to your birthday party?

01:41:28.833 --> 01:41:30.083
What was all that?

01:41:39.291 --> 01:41:42.375
I asked you stay over
because I get bored alone.

01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:46.208
I took you to the Maldives
because you're my trainer.

01:41:47.041 --> 01:41:50.958
I met your friends
because you kept asking me to.

01:41:55.166 --> 01:41:57.833
I really like you, Neil, butâ€¦ I meanâ€¦

01:41:59.291 --> 01:42:01.250
But Kartik has bought you.

01:42:05.708 --> 01:42:09.791
You don't get to judge me.
You hardly know me.

01:42:09.875 --> 01:42:12.750
Explain your fake morality
to someone else!

01:42:12.833 --> 01:42:15.541
If you were in my place,
you'd do the exact same thing.

01:42:16.583 --> 01:42:17.583
Fuck!

01:42:28.875 --> 01:42:29.875
Rohan?

01:42:46.125 --> 01:42:50.458
The number you have dialed is
currently busy.

01:42:53.875 --> 01:42:59.500
The customer you are trying to speak to is
busy at the moment. Please call back--

01:43:26.625 --> 01:43:28.083
You've blocked me.

01:44:29.333 --> 01:44:31.541
Congratulations. You were right.

01:44:33.333 --> 01:44:35.458
She was always honest with me.

01:44:38.166 --> 01:44:40.041
I couldn't even do that much for her.

01:44:44.625 --> 01:44:45.791
It's done.

01:44:47.041 --> 01:44:48.291
It's over.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.208
What do you want?

01:45:01.166 --> 01:45:02.541
I want to talk to her.

01:45:05.041 --> 01:45:06.833
I want to tell her

01:45:09.875 --> 01:45:11.333
that I'm not okay.

01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:20.666
I have a problem.

01:45:31.666 --> 01:45:33.125
I have a problem.

01:45:43.458 --> 01:45:44.458
-What's up?
-Yo.

01:45:45.125 --> 01:45:46.333
What happened with Lala?

01:45:48.625 --> 01:45:51.041
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

01:45:51.958 --> 01:45:53.625
She's complained about you.

01:45:54.291 --> 01:45:55.750
She wants another trainer.

01:45:56.625 --> 01:45:58.208
So something must've happened.

01:46:00.083 --> 01:46:01.541
Look, Harsh,

01:46:01.625 --> 01:46:04.166
Lala and me, it's a bit complicated.

01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:05.791
This won't fly here.

01:46:05.875 --> 01:46:08.208
-Dude, it's not my fault.
-Don't want to know.

01:46:09.875 --> 01:46:10.875
You're out.

01:46:14.166 --> 01:46:15.166
Look.

01:46:15.916 --> 01:46:18.000
This could turn
into a big issue for the gym.

01:46:19.416 --> 01:46:20.666
I'm sorry, bro.

01:47:07.208 --> 01:47:10.583
"My name is Laxami Lalvani. AKA Lala."

01:47:10.666 --> 01:47:12.583
"And it's my job to influence you."

01:47:13.375 --> 01:47:17.916
"Tell you how to look.
What to eat. Where to go."

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:23.041
"Your job is to keep looking at me.
And wishing you had my life."

01:47:26.333 --> 01:47:29.041
"But there's a problem. It's all fake."

01:47:29.958 --> 01:47:32.750
"The clothes I wear aren't mine."

01:47:32.833 --> 01:47:35.375
"I don't pay for the hotels I visit."

01:47:36.791 --> 01:47:40.041
"I have over a million followers
because I buy them."

01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:42.583
"Look at that beautiful nose."

01:47:43.125 --> 01:47:45.458
"Of course, it's photoshopped."

01:47:45.541 --> 01:47:47.500
"I apply filters to my face."

01:47:47.583 --> 01:47:50.083
"Not the beauty products I sell you."

01:47:51.041 --> 01:47:52.541
"Because you're the consumers."

01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:54.708
"I'm just an ad."

01:47:55.291 --> 01:47:56.833
"A walking, talking billboard."

01:47:57.583 --> 01:47:59.041
"I don't love you."

01:47:59.125 --> 01:48:02.583
"I thank you
because I make money off you."

01:48:02.666 --> 01:48:06.333
"I flirt with you so that you follow me,
fantasize about me."

01:48:06.833 --> 01:48:10.041
"Fantasizing is all you can do
because I am a fantasy."

01:48:10.625 --> 01:48:14.375
"You aren't rich enough
to make me your reality."

01:48:32.583 --> 01:48:35.666
We're done with Ahana's farewell.
When are you quitting, Meher?

01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:37.833
When Ahana offers me a job.

01:48:40.208 --> 01:48:41.666
Go easy, bro.

01:48:42.333 --> 01:48:44.791
Rohan and I got a room after the sangeet.

01:48:45.291 --> 01:48:46.208
What?

01:48:47.208 --> 01:48:49.125
And before I woke up, he vanished.

01:48:55.875 --> 01:48:57.416
Isn't it his birthday today?

01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:02.333
Show.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.291
"Brunch with baby."

01:49:05.875 --> 01:49:07.000
"Birthday week."

01:49:09.125 --> 01:49:10.541
Let it go, Ahana.

01:49:11.541 --> 01:49:13.625
Seriously, he's an asshole.

01:49:19.291 --> 01:49:21.958
Where are you going? Ahana!

01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:26.541
Ahana. Hey.

01:49:27.625 --> 01:49:28.791
Come in, I guess.

01:49:40.666 --> 01:49:42.333
Look, who's here. Look.

01:49:44.875 --> 01:49:46.208
Ahana.

01:49:46.291 --> 01:49:48.750
-Hi!
-What's up?

01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:51.333
-How are you? What's up?
-Good.

01:49:51.416 --> 01:49:53.875
-Hey, Ahana. How are you?
-Hi! Good.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.583
Where you coming from, babe?

01:49:55.666 --> 01:49:57.416
-Work.
-Sure.

01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:58.500
Work.

01:49:59.708 --> 01:50:00.541
Cute.

01:50:01.875 --> 01:50:03.791
Happy birthday, Rohan.

01:50:04.875 --> 01:50:06.000
Thank you.

01:50:07.666 --> 01:50:09.750
To what do I owe this surprise?

01:50:10.333 --> 01:50:13.958
You surprised me too, at their sangeet.

01:50:14.041 --> 01:50:15.833
I thought I'd return the favor.

01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:18.750
Hi, I'm Tanya.

01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:20.958
Ahana.

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:25.416
Can I get you something to drink?

01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:29.458
Champagne would be great.

01:50:29.541 --> 01:50:30.541
Sure.

01:50:32.833 --> 01:50:36.125
-Got a new house help?
-Why are you doing this?

01:50:37.416 --> 01:50:38.708
Let me think.

01:50:38.791 --> 01:50:41.833
You slept with me and then you blocked me.

01:50:42.375 --> 01:50:45.708
And then you went for waffles with "baby."
Maybe that's why, Rohan.

01:50:46.875 --> 01:50:47.958
Why can't I speak?

01:50:51.541 --> 01:50:53.583
-Imaad.
-Hey, Aisha. What's up?

01:50:54.291 --> 01:50:56.625
-You could've called.
-You blocked me.

01:50:57.583 --> 01:51:01.958
-Ahana, can we speak tomorrow, please?
-Why did you hook up with me?

01:51:04.458 --> 01:51:05.750
You don't know.

01:51:05.833 --> 01:51:07.500
Maybe your friends knowâ€¦

01:51:07.583 --> 01:51:11.041
No. I just wanted closure. Okay?

01:51:11.125 --> 01:51:15.125
-Things ended so abruptly.
-Abruptly?

01:51:15.250 --> 01:51:16.750
You ended it, you piece of shit.

01:51:16.833 --> 01:51:20.208
But we didn't get a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

01:51:20.291 --> 01:51:23.833
Because you lied!
You said you wanted a break.

01:51:23.916 --> 01:51:25.500
Is this your way of saying goodbye?

01:51:25.583 --> 01:51:27.583
Is that why you were texting me, Rohan?

01:51:28.166 --> 01:51:30.708
I just want us to be friends. Okay?

01:51:30.791 --> 01:51:32.833
Is that how you talk to your friends?

01:51:32.916 --> 01:51:34.708
"Hi, baby, you look so hot."

01:51:35.291 --> 01:51:36.125
Rohan?

01:51:36.208 --> 01:51:37.833
I was complimenting you, okay?

01:51:37.916 --> 01:51:40.750
-If you got offended, not my problem.
-I wasn't offended.

01:51:40.833 --> 01:51:43.666
You flirted with me, and I flirted
back and we hooked up.

01:51:44.333 --> 01:51:47.416
I'm sorry. I feel like shit about it.

01:51:48.708 --> 01:51:50.083
You feel like shit?

01:51:50.166 --> 01:51:52.750
I feel like shit since we broke up.
But do you care?

01:51:52.833 --> 01:51:54.333
Sure, I care, but you seemed happy.

01:51:54.416 --> 01:51:56.833
-When?
-I saw your posts.

01:51:56.916 --> 01:51:58.083
You even went on a date.

01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:01.666
You have moved on. Just admit it.

01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:04.083
It wasn't a date. I was just pretending.

01:52:05.291 --> 01:52:08.791
Seeing your super happy life
and your perfect girlfriend everyday,

01:52:08.916 --> 01:52:10.083
I'm fed up, Rohan.

01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:11.833
Then stop looking. Why are you looking?

01:52:11.916 --> 01:52:15.333
I don't know. I can't stop.

01:52:17.791 --> 01:52:20.041
I just wanted your attention, Rohan.

01:52:25.916 --> 01:52:27.083
Wow.

01:52:33.833 --> 01:52:35.166
I'm so stupid.

01:52:37.708 --> 01:52:40.708
To think my self-worth depended
on an asshole like you.

01:52:46.625 --> 01:52:48.708
Ask him where he was on the sangeet night.

01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:50.916
Ahana, what the hell?

01:53:51.791 --> 01:53:52.958
Ahana!

01:54:04.041 --> 01:54:04.875
It's okay.

01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:07.750
Let's go home.

01:54:08.416 --> 01:54:09.791
No.

01:54:12.083 --> 01:54:12.916
Fuck!

01:54:15.958 --> 01:54:17.541
That was a bitch move, Ahana.

01:54:19.166 --> 01:54:20.000
Imaad.

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.625
Is that how you talk?

01:54:22.125 --> 01:54:23.458
What you gonna do?

01:54:24.375 --> 01:54:27.083
Imaad, leave it, please. Stop it, guys.

01:54:27.166 --> 01:54:28.500
-Stay out of it.
-Stay out?

01:54:28.583 --> 01:54:30.250
-What are you doing, Rohan?
-No touching!

01:54:30.333 --> 01:54:32.708
-Stay out of it.
-Imaad, what are you doing?

01:54:32.791 --> 01:54:35.333
Guys, stop it! What are you doing?

01:54:35.416 --> 01:54:37.125
Imaad, stop it!

01:54:38.375 --> 01:54:39.708
Rohan, get off him!

01:54:40.291 --> 01:54:42.083
Rohan, stop it. You're hurting him.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:55:07.083 --> 01:55:09.375
You broke my nose.
Now see what I do to you.

01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:11.666
That was a bitch move, Neil.

01:55:14.833 --> 01:55:15.958
Let's get out of here.

01:55:19.666 --> 01:55:22.500
You're something. Good timing.

01:55:22.583 --> 01:55:24.625
He deserved a few birthday bumps.

01:55:25.708 --> 01:55:27.583
You should've given one more from me.

01:55:38.458 --> 01:55:39.625
Neil.

01:55:40.583 --> 01:55:42.125
Have you seen Lala's page?

01:55:42.875 --> 01:55:43.916
What happened?

01:55:45.041 --> 01:55:47.291
Look at her page. She's getting bullied.

01:55:49.083 --> 01:55:50.291
Look at the comments.

01:55:50.375 --> 01:55:54.500
She's photoshopped her images.
Apparently, she's done her lips.

01:55:55.083 --> 01:55:57.625
-Shit!
-Obviously she's been hacked.

01:55:57.708 --> 01:55:58.958
Who'd do such a thing?

01:55:59.458 --> 01:56:01.750
-Now they're all trolling her.
-Look at this.

01:56:02.750 --> 01:56:06.250
"Lightened skin, social climber, sellout."

01:56:06.333 --> 01:56:07.708
This is horrible, dude.

01:56:07.833 --> 01:56:09.166
-I know.
-"Nose job."

01:56:10.333 --> 01:56:12.416
"A Nagpur call center accent."

01:56:15.916 --> 01:56:17.500
Neil, call her.

01:56:18.250 --> 01:56:20.958
She should file a complaint.
This is messed up.

01:56:23.916 --> 01:56:24.958
Neil?

01:56:28.166 --> 01:56:29.000
What is it?

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:34.708
I hacked her account.

01:56:36.708 --> 01:56:37.625
What?

01:56:39.416 --> 01:56:42.375
-I put up that first post.
-Why?

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.916
She complained about me to Harsh.

01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:53.791
I was fired from the gym.

01:56:55.416 --> 01:56:56.541
You guys broke up?

01:56:57.875 --> 01:56:59.500
She cheated on me.

01:57:02.250 --> 01:57:05.625
I didn't have what she was looking for,
so she found someone else.

01:57:07.833 --> 01:57:09.958
She put up a story,
kissing that guy while I was--

01:57:10.083 --> 01:57:12.375
Neil, I'm sorry that you were hurt,

01:57:12.958 --> 01:57:14.708
but that doesn't mean you take revenge.

01:57:15.916 --> 01:57:17.958
I can't believe you would do this, Neil.

01:57:41.916 --> 01:57:43.208
What you are and haveâ€¦

01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:47.291
maybe she couldn't see it.

01:57:49.083 --> 01:57:50.291
And neither can you.

01:57:50.958 --> 01:57:52.708
That's the problem.

01:58:01.333 --> 01:58:02.333
Yeah.

01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:51.541
"Lala, I hacked
into your account yesterday."

01:58:52.958 --> 01:58:54.666
"I put up that post in your name."

01:58:55.875 --> 01:58:57.291
"I violated your privacy."

01:58:59.291 --> 01:59:01.041
"I wanted to humiliate you."

01:59:01.125 --> 01:59:02.583
"I just wanted to shame you."

01:59:03.541 --> 01:59:05.375
"But what happened since

01:59:06.041 --> 01:59:07.708
"has left me ashamed of myself."

01:59:08.833 --> 01:59:12.291
"I don't have an explanation
for my actions."

01:59:14.375 --> 01:59:17.125
"Except that I wasn't happy with myself."

01:59:19.333 --> 01:59:21.416
"All I saw were my shortcomings."

01:59:22.541 --> 01:59:25.250
"I was so caught up
with what I don't have,

01:59:25.875 --> 01:59:31.291
"that I never saw or appreciated
the things I have."

01:59:37.375 --> 01:59:39.041
"I had forgotten to be grateful."

01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:45.333
"I don't expect to be forgiven, Lala.
I crossed a line."

01:59:45.416 --> 01:59:48.500
"And I'm ready to face the consequences."

01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:55.375
"But I want you and everyone else to know

01:59:55.458 --> 01:59:58.666
"that the things I wrote show my reality."

01:59:59.625 --> 02:00:00.583
"Not yours."

02:00:01.375 --> 02:00:03.333
"I'm truly sorry to have hurt you, Lala."

02:00:04.041 --> 02:00:05.166
"Neil Pereira."

02:00:10.875 --> 02:00:15.750
Dating apps should've made life easier,
but meeting someone is even tougher.

02:00:15.833 --> 02:00:19.125
The thing is, now we reject people
at a superficial level.

02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:22.250
"I don't want to date
somebody named Jignesh."

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.041
She's an investment banker?
No, she'll keep repeating,

02:00:26.125 --> 02:00:28.291
"Mutual fund investments are
subject to market risks."

02:00:28.375 --> 02:00:31.375
"Please read the offer document carefully
before committing."

02:00:33.083 --> 02:00:35.750
In this world of easy judgements
and shallow connections,

02:00:35.833 --> 02:00:37.541
I finally managed to find someone.

02:00:38.041 --> 02:00:41.416
Somebody I could trust,
maybe fall in love with.

02:00:42.875 --> 02:00:43.708
Thank you.

02:00:43.791 --> 02:00:46.500
And in classic Imaad style,
I completely screwed it up.

02:00:47.083 --> 02:00:50.875
For the first time it felt good.
I was comfortable with someone.

02:00:50.958 --> 02:00:52.291
Then a voice from my heart said,

02:00:52.375 --> 02:00:55.250
"Man, it's been a while
since I enjoyed an Arijit Singh song."

02:00:56.833 --> 02:01:01.500
Seriously, the person I've had the longest
and most consistent relationship with

02:01:01.583 --> 02:01:02.750
is my therapist.

02:01:04.875 --> 02:01:06.416
My therapist asked me,

02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:09.958
"Imaad, when was the last time
you had an intimate relationship?"

02:01:10.541 --> 02:01:12.916
I was like, "Last night."

02:01:14.291 --> 02:01:15.625
"It was very intimate."

02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:17.666
And she was like,

02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:20.666
"Imaad, this is my therapy clinic,
not Koffee with Karan."

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:24.500
"I'm talking about emotional intimacy."

02:01:27.083 --> 02:01:31.208
And for the first time in my life,
even as a comedian, I had no comeback.

02:01:37.041 --> 02:01:38.416
Emotional intimacy.

02:01:41.791 --> 02:01:44.291
I feel like if I open up to people,

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.375
they'll judge me and leave.

02:01:47.291 --> 02:01:50.000
So, before they can leave me,
I leave them.

02:01:51.166 --> 02:01:54.125
I still lose out in the end.
But you see, my ego is on a high.

02:01:57.083 --> 02:01:59.291
I'm used to being alone since I was a kid.

02:01:59.833 --> 02:02:01.750
I was nine when my mother passed away.

02:02:01.833 --> 02:02:04.875
My dad decided he would not spend
the rest of his life alone.

02:02:05.458 --> 02:02:10.375
So every evening, he'd chill with
a Mr. Johnnie Walker, or with an Old Monk.

02:02:12.583 --> 02:02:16.166
This was his version of therapy.
Cheap and effective.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.458
Sometimes his business partners
would come over for drinks.

02:02:22.541 --> 02:02:25.041
One night dad indulged
in too much therapy,

02:02:25.625 --> 02:02:26.791
so he went to bed.

02:02:27.833 --> 02:02:31.208
His business partner came to me,
and he offered me chocolates.

02:02:32.250 --> 02:02:36.416
Now, for a ten-year-old, to get chocolates
is like winning the lottery.

02:02:40.208 --> 02:02:42.041
He asked me where the washroom was.

02:02:43.708 --> 02:02:44.833
I took him there.

02:02:45.666 --> 02:02:48.208
And suddenly he pulled me in with him.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.833
Before I could even process
what was happening to me,

02:02:55.208 --> 02:02:56.708
it happened again.

02:02:59.875 --> 02:03:01.041
Then again.

02:03:02.666 --> 02:03:03.916
And another night.

02:03:07.375 --> 02:03:08.833
And more chocolates.

02:03:11.541 --> 02:03:13.625
The wrappers started piling up.

02:03:19.416 --> 02:03:21.125
I know what you guys are thinking.

02:03:21.833 --> 02:03:23.583
Imaad must really like chocolates.

02:03:23.666 --> 02:03:25.333
He'd do anything for them.

02:03:28.708 --> 02:03:32.250
When my dad saw the chocolates, he said,
"Son, these are expensive chocolates."

02:03:32.333 --> 02:03:35.541
I said, "Yeah, Dad. You have no idea."

02:03:37.375 --> 02:03:38.708
What could I have said?

02:03:39.375 --> 02:03:42.083
Your business partner is
mixing business with pleasure?

02:03:52.916 --> 02:03:55.500
What's going on, guys?
Don't be awkward, you can laugh.

02:03:56.875 --> 02:03:58.875
If you don't, you'll spoil my show.

02:03:59.625 --> 02:04:02.916
And I can't even eat chocolates
to cheer myself up.

02:04:11.833 --> 02:04:12.958
Intimacy.

02:04:13.916 --> 02:04:15.500
Into-me-see.

02:04:19.375 --> 02:04:21.833
For the past fifteen years,
I've had only one aim.

02:04:22.708 --> 02:04:24.375
That no one should know my truth.

02:04:27.708 --> 02:04:29.125
No one should see it.

02:04:29.791 --> 02:04:31.875
I snuck my way through life till here.

02:04:33.041 --> 02:04:36.208
I did whatever I had to. I lied.

02:04:36.791 --> 02:04:38.375
Spoiled relationships.

02:04:39.083 --> 02:04:40.541
Cracked stupid jokes.

02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:42.458
To avoid the truth.

02:04:45.125 --> 02:04:47.791
I never even told my friends about it.

02:04:49.041 --> 02:04:52.083
I thought it was my fault.

02:04:54.333 --> 02:04:55.625
That nightâ€¦

02:04:57.833 --> 02:04:59.708
What could a ten-year-old have done?

02:05:00.666 --> 02:05:02.083
He could've shouted.

02:05:04.208 --> 02:05:06.333
Tried to stop it. Could've run away.

02:05:09.166 --> 02:05:10.625
And since that day,

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.291
all I've done is run.

02:05:17.875 --> 02:05:19.416
But not anymore.

02:05:21.916 --> 02:05:24.291
I've spent 15 years of my life
with this shame.

02:05:26.375 --> 02:05:27.500
I'm done.

02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:38.333
Tonight I'm taking control of my life
back in my hands.

02:05:42.208 --> 02:05:44.750
And there could be
no better place to share.

02:05:45.666 --> 02:05:48.458
'Cause if I regret telling you this,
I can always say,

02:05:49.291 --> 02:05:50.416
"It was a joke."

02:07:07.875 --> 02:07:09.583
It's 31st of December.

02:07:10.166 --> 02:07:11.458
We're a bit older.

02:07:12.041 --> 02:07:13.375
And a lot wiser.

02:07:14.083 --> 02:07:16.333
Wise to the fact that,
like any drug addict

02:07:17.041 --> 02:07:19.166
the problem wasn't chasing the high,

02:07:19.250 --> 02:07:21.000
it was running away from reality.

02:07:22.291 --> 02:07:24.708
We got so lost in our screens,

02:07:24.791 --> 02:07:26.791
we forgot to look within ourselves.

02:07:27.416 --> 02:07:29.750
Since today is a day for new beginnings,

02:07:30.458 --> 02:07:31.666
let's reboot.

02:07:35.166 --> 02:07:36.125
Resolution one.

02:07:38.166 --> 02:07:39.833
Put your phone down.

02:07:40.583 --> 02:07:41.958
And look up.

02:07:44.875 --> 02:07:46.750
Look life in the eye.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.708
Because life is meant for living.

02:07:52.375 --> 02:07:54.666
Without filters, without lenses.

02:08:00.250 --> 02:08:01.416
Resolution two.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.416
Take it easy, keep it real.

02:08:06.125 --> 02:08:09.250
Recognize that it doesn't take much
to be happy.

02:08:10.583 --> 02:08:12.958
Only when you truly connect with yourself

02:08:13.541 --> 02:08:15.333
can people truly connect with you.

02:08:16.458 --> 02:08:19.958
We're free of all our woes
That's all we know

02:08:20.541 --> 02:08:24.291
We'll heed our hearts
We'll follow them where they go

02:08:25.458 --> 02:08:26.583
Resolution three.

02:08:26.666 --> 02:08:28.041
Stop the comparisons.

02:08:28.583 --> 02:08:32.666
No one is like you,
and you don't need to be like anyone else.

02:08:34.791 --> 02:08:38.583
Where did we lose ourselves?

02:08:42.750 --> 02:08:46.083
Where did we lose ourselves?

02:08:46.166 --> 02:08:47.250
You are unique.

02:08:47.333 --> 02:08:50.000
The only person better than you today
is you tomorrow.

02:08:57.708 --> 02:08:59.916
Resolution four. Be grateful.

02:09:03.708 --> 02:09:08.750
Say "Thank you."
Loud and clear. Every day.

02:09:10.208 --> 02:09:17.041
Why think of things
That make us feel so low?

02:09:19.458 --> 02:09:23.208
We're free of all our woes
That's all we really know

02:09:25.083 --> 02:09:26.375
And resolution five.

02:09:26.958 --> 02:09:27.875
Find your tribe.

02:09:28.666 --> 02:09:31.875
Because who needs followers
when you have friends?

02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:41.125
Where did we lose ourselves?

02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:51.416
Where did we lose ourselves?
