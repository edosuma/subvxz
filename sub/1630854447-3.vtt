00:23.081 --> 00:25.686
<i>Many thoughts had crossed
Toby's mind in the hours</i>

00:25.686 --> 00:27.924
<i>since he was informed
that his missing wife</i>

00:27.924 --> 00:30.094
<i>was, in fact,
napping in the park.</i>

00:30.094 --> 00:32.499
<i>But only one of them stuck.</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:34.304
<i>It was-- How did he get here?</i>

00:34.304 --> 00:37.309
<i>Literally, he had no memory
of the end of the conversation</i>

00:37.309 --> 00:39.113
<i>he had with Rachel's friends.</i>

00:39.113 --> 00:41.985
<i>He had, apparently, purchased
rotted watermelon</i>

00:41.985 --> 00:44.958
<i>in his attempt
to not appear so crazy,</i>

00:44.958 --> 00:48.432
<i>and he had, apparently,
somehow gotten home.</i>

00:48.432 --> 00:50.302
<i>How did he get here?</i>

00:50.302 --> 00:52.038
<i>How did he get back
to his apartment?</i>

00:52.038 --> 00:55.847
<i>But also, how did he get here?</i>

00:55.847 --> 00:57.883
<i>It was a good question.</i>

01:01.224 --> 01:03.662
<i>The story of the end of Toby
and Rachel's marriage</i>

01:03.662 --> 01:05.299
<i>starts with
the beginning of it.</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:06.968
<i>It starts with Toby,
right at the beginning</i>

01:06.968 --> 01:09.474
<i>of medical school,
being dragged to a party</i>

01:09.474 --> 01:11.311
<i>he didn't want to attend.</i>

01:11.311 --> 01:12.813
Hey.
Hey.

01:12.813 --> 01:14.182
It's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be fun.

01:14.182 --> 01:15.852
Yes.

01:17.323 --> 01:18.491
Are you kidding?

01:18.491 --> 01:21.230
I spent an entire year
at Hebrew U.

01:21.230 --> 01:22.734
<i>Lo ichpat li.</i>

01:22.734 --> 01:25.506
Uh, <i>ayn li savla.
Lo todah.</i>

01:25.506 --> 01:29.747
Young Judea's
hottest alumnus stalks his prey.

01:29.747 --> 01:31.885
<i>Mah ha sha-ah,</i> baby.

01:31.885 --> 01:33.822
We are compadres.

01:33.822 --> 01:35.024
We are comrades.

01:35.024 --> 01:37.195
Using a terrible accent,
he lures

01:37.195 --> 01:40.201
the hot Israeli law student
in her native habitat.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.506
His absent foreskin as bait,

01:42.506 --> 01:44.510
the American
draws her in closer.

01:44.510 --> 01:45.413
Did you do time
in the army?

01:45.413 --> 01:47.283
She's entering his orbit.

01:47.283 --> 01:49.019
She's in the danger zone.

01:49.019 --> 01:51.758
Contact!
And now, she is dinner.

01:51.758 --> 01:53.528
I thought
that they taught Israelis

01:53.528 --> 01:56.033
defense skills
in the military.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.903
I don't think
they trained them against Seth.

01:57.903 --> 01:59.841
<i>We were fast friends by then.</i>

01:59.841 --> 02:01.611
<i>After our program
in Israel ended,</i>

02:01.611 --> 02:03.381
<i>we visited each other
in college.</i>

02:03.381 --> 02:05.386
<i>There could have been something
between Toby and me,</i>

02:05.386 --> 02:08.391
<i>I don't know, but my weirdness
about relationships</i>

02:08.391 --> 02:11.898
<i>and Toby's sense of himself
as unlucky in the romantic arts</i>

02:11.898 --> 02:13.602
<i>had followed him home
through customs.</i>

02:13.602 --> 02:15.373
Alright, I'll find you. Alright.

02:15.373 --> 02:17.409
<i>By the time we all ended up
at the business school party</i>

02:17.409 --> 02:20.115
<i>at Columbia, Toby had just
started medical school at NYU.</i>

02:20.115 --> 02:21.885
We're gonna
meet up later.

02:21.885 --> 02:23.889
She was in Sayeret Egoz.

02:23.889 --> 02:25.426
That's guerilla warfare.

02:25.426 --> 02:28.064
She told me something
I really shouldn't say.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.301
She knows
who killed Rabin.

02:29.301 --> 02:30.903
Yeah, everybody knows
who killed Rabin.

02:30.903 --> 02:32.439
She extra knows.
I can't say more.

02:32.439 --> 02:33.909
Well, maybe
you shouldn't.

02:33.909 --> 02:35.446
God, it's like you have
a scent or something.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.814
You just need to relax.

02:36.814 --> 02:38.084
Is that really how
it goes for you?

02:38.084 --> 02:39.588
Like, women, they're just
so attracted

02:39.588 --> 02:41.491
to how relaxed
you are?

02:41.491 --> 02:43.796
You know, I would be very
relaxed too if I had your luck.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.164
Meaning if I was ejaculating
as often as he--

02:45.164 --> 02:46.568
No, I think we understood
what you--
Yeah.

02:46.568 --> 02:48.070
It's not luck.
I know it's not.

02:48.070 --> 02:49.574
I was just trying to, like,
preserve my dignity here.

02:49.574 --> 02:50.910
Did I tell you
I bumped into

02:50.910 --> 02:52.380
Jennifer Alkon
the other day?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.482
Ugh.
Really?
Yes.

02:53.482 --> 02:54.984
We made up
for lost time.

02:54.984 --> 02:57.088
Ew.
What I'm saying
is fifth base.

02:57.088 --> 02:58.759
Oh, no.
One, two, three,
four, five!

02:58.759 --> 03:01.096
That's exactly--
that's, like, her thing.

03:01.096 --> 03:02.266
So-- Ugh.

03:02.266 --> 03:05.772
May you preserve
your dignity...

03:05.772 --> 03:09.179
Okay.
...upon your intrepid exploration

03:09.179 --> 03:13.989
of the anus
of Jennifer Alkon.

03:13.989 --> 03:16.962
May you find yourself migrating
onward from her perineum.

03:16.962 --> 03:18.464
I will.
I will.

03:18.464 --> 03:21.103
God, he's, like, re-having sex
with people and I'm what?

03:21.103 --> 03:22.940
You're making
anal sex jokes.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.142
Shouldn't I have met somebody
in college?

03:24.142 --> 03:25.111
Isn't that where
people meet?

03:25.111 --> 03:26.080
Yes.
No, not me. I--

03:26.080 --> 03:27.450
I'm a good listener.

03:27.450 --> 03:29.086
You know, I exercise.
I'm in medical school.

03:29.086 --> 03:30.288
I thought girls
wanted doctors.

03:30.288 --> 03:32.125
No, girls <i>want</i>
to want doctors.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.331
That's like--
That's our mothers' dream.

03:34.331 --> 03:38.338
I personally want to free myself
from every Jewish girl cliche.

03:38.338 --> 03:39.039
Really?
Yeah.

03:39.039 --> 03:40.275
So, what do you want?

03:40.275 --> 03:41.744
A lawyer. Okay.

03:41.744 --> 03:43.648
God, I have to go.
I'm tired, and--

03:43.648 --> 03:45.619
No.
...I have to study,
and I know how this ends.

03:45.619 --> 03:47.022
Why don't we get
another drink?

03:47.022 --> 03:48.592
Why are your cups
empty?

03:48.592 --> 03:50.495
Because I was having
a Diet Coke.

03:50.495 --> 03:52.400
You're having a--
That's not fun.
Have the punch.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.635
Do you have any idea
what's in that punch?

03:53.635 --> 03:54.870
Yeah.
Fun.

03:54.870 --> 03:56.408
Really?
Okay.

03:56.408 --> 03:57.810
Yeah.
Okay. Come on.

03:57.810 --> 03:59.480
<i>It really was that easy
with us.</i>

03:59.480 --> 04:02.219
<i>But then, our friendships
were never the problem.</i>

04:02.219 --> 04:05.191
<i>It was the longing and pining
for romantic relationships</i>

04:05.191 --> 04:07.463
<i>that preoccupied us
and maybe allowed us</i>

04:07.463 --> 04:10.034
<i>to think that friends like
this were easy to come by.</i>

04:10.034 --> 04:11.404
Lookit.
He really does have a scent.

04:11.404 --> 04:12.706
I know.

04:12.706 --> 04:13.542
I gotta go
to the bathroom.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.245
Okay.

04:40.161 --> 04:44.403
Um, yes, I noticed that, like,
you don't have any, uh, punch,

04:44.403 --> 04:46.741
and I, um,
I highly recommend it.

04:46.741 --> 04:48.812
You threw yours out
pretty fast.

04:48.812 --> 04:50.382
Well, yeah, because
I-I think the host

04:50.382 --> 04:51.517
is actually trying
to roofie me.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.255
Oh.
Yeah.

04:53.255 --> 04:55.959
<i>People used to make
roofie jokes in the '90s.</i>

04:55.959 --> 04:57.195
I'm actually just
concerned about,

04:57.195 --> 04:58.565
um, whatever
the ingredient is

04:58.565 --> 05:00.569
that turns it that
particular shade of purple.

05:00.569 --> 05:02.239
Really?
Yeah.

05:02.239 --> 05:04.444
To me, it's the only reason
to drink the stuff.

05:04.444 --> 05:05.679
Well, I don't know.

05:05.679 --> 05:07.216
I just don't want
any future kids to, you know,

05:07.216 --> 05:08.384
turn out
smelling like purple.

05:10.623 --> 05:12.092
What, are you--
are you, like,

05:12.092 --> 05:13.729
in the artificial color
racket or something?

05:13.729 --> 05:15.966
Uh, no.

05:15.966 --> 05:18.238
Um, I'm a business major.

05:18.238 --> 05:20.609
Ah. Interesting.
Are you, uh, finance?

05:20.609 --> 05:22.613
No, I...
Marketing, maybe?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.383
Huh.
I don't know.

05:24.383 --> 05:27.623
I-I just, uh, finished
this symposium on negotiating.

05:27.623 --> 05:29.561
I loved it.
That's cool.

05:29.561 --> 05:30.763
Uh, negotiate with me.

05:30.763 --> 05:32.700
I can't.
It wouldn't be fair.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.969
You'd--
You'd never win.

05:33.969 --> 05:35.038
Really?

05:35.038 --> 05:36.374
Ah, come on.
Try me.

05:36.374 --> 05:40.147
Um, I'd like four
for the price of two.

05:40.147 --> 05:42.253
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're gonna
have to pay for all four.

05:42.253 --> 05:45.559
I'll only be paying

10:15.732 --> 10:17.469

she moved to Israel,

10:17.469 --> 10:18.971

she took it way too far

10:18.971 --> 10:20.509
and now she's,
like, Orthodox

10:20.509 --> 10:21.710

like a million babies.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.481

10:26.988 --> 10:29.660

she loved me a lot.

a scene of it, but...

10:40.716 --> 10:42.486
but I remember it.

10:44.757 --> 10:46.627
Or maybe what I
actually remember

10:46.627 --> 10:49.600
is that my grandmother
didn't love me.

I mean, not--
not that she didn't.

10:52.572 --> 10:53.975

for my mother, which...

11:09.607 --> 11:12.445

19:09.599 --> 19:11.337
Uh, I'll be right back. Okay.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.613
I haven't seen you
in like four months.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.551
I got married.

19:18.551 --> 19:19.987
It gets busy
when you get married.

19:19.987 --> 19:21.691
Oh, it's busy
when you get married.

19:21.691 --> 19:22.959
Yeah.
You got to make decisions.

19:22.959 --> 19:24.530
You have to choose
what your life is.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.865
You wouldn't understand.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.104
We got to the theater
all the time,

19:29.104 --> 19:31.142
and then you get out
and it's 11:00

19:31.142 --> 19:33.247
and the only place that's open
is this place, uh, Joe Allen,

19:33.247 --> 19:35.150
so we go there and all
of her colleagues are there,

19:35.150 --> 19:38.056
and, I don't know, I want to be
a good spouse, you know?

19:38.056 --> 19:40.328
If I have to choose, I want
to choose to make her happy.

19:40.328 --> 19:43.166
I want to...
Yeah, I want to choose her.

19:43.166 --> 19:46.239
Why-- I mean, why do you have
to choose in the first place?

19:46.239 --> 19:48.243
Like, why are you
choosing at all?

19:50.215 --> 19:51.750
That line
is way too long.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.520
Actually, I realized
the thing's at 7:00.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.657
It's not at 8:00.
Oh, no.

19:54.657 --> 19:56.259
The thing's at 7:00.

19:57.428 --> 20:00.234
Um...
Are you ready?

20:00.234 --> 20:01.270
Yeah. Yeah.

20:01.270 --> 20:03.173
So, um, I will see you soon. Yeah.

20:03.173 --> 20:05.211
Yeah, yeah.
Do you want my plate of...

20:05.211 --> 20:06.847
Right. Bye.

20:06.847 --> 20:08.351
Sorry. It was really nice
to see you, Libby.

20:08.351 --> 20:10.288
So good to see you.

20:18.571 --> 20:20.442
<i>The last time Toby and I
were alone before this summer</i>

20:20.442 --> 20:22.077
<i>was almost 13 years ago,</i>

20:22.077 --> 20:23.981
<i>when I'd published an essay
in a small anthology.</i>

20:23.981 --> 20:25.618
"It hadn't been that long
since I had asked

20:25.618 --> 20:27.455
that question myself,

20:27.455 --> 20:31.330
but let me tell you, in the
interest of self-preservation,

20:31.330 --> 20:35.772
I recommend not asking
more than once."

20:35.772 --> 20:38.578
<i>He came to my
first ever reading.</i>

20:38.578 --> 20:40.281
Whoo!

20:40.281 --> 20:41.783
You know,
I always remember

20:41.783 --> 20:43.387
hoping you would get
out of your own way.

20:43.387 --> 20:47.529
I was just worried you were
too crazy to truly do it.

20:47.529 --> 20:48.597
Really?
Yes, yes.

20:48.597 --> 20:50.435
I'm proud of you.

20:50.435 --> 20:53.507
Here's to late bloomers.

20:53.507 --> 20:55.579
Do you ever
hear yourself?

20:55.579 --> 20:58.617
What?
What's wrong?

20:58.617 --> 21:01.188
My God.

21:01.188 --> 21:04.128
Jesus, Elizabeth.
Who smokes anymore?

21:05.799 --> 21:07.401
Um, can I have one?

21:09.840 --> 21:12.612
You mind if I--
Can I borrow this?

21:12.612 --> 21:14.115
Thank you.
What are you doing?

21:14.115 --> 21:17.522
Oh, just so Rachel
doesn't smell the smoke.

21:17.522 --> 21:18.758
Wow.

21:18.758 --> 21:20.795
What?
What a man you are.

21:20.795 --> 21:23.033
Excuse me, that is
sexual harassment.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.603
And I don't have to
take it anymore.

21:24.603 --> 21:26.640
That's right.
I just...

21:26.640 --> 21:28.143
Be careful.

21:28.143 --> 21:31.384
You're... changing faster
than the rest of us.

21:31.384 --> 21:33.754
Excuse me?
What does that mean?

21:33.754 --> 21:37.729
It means I miss you,
is what it means.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.166
Oh.
It means
don't be an asshole.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.303
Libby was smoking.

21:59.573 --> 22:01.175
What's wrong?

22:08.524 --> 22:10.528
Rachel.

22:10.528 --> 22:12.466
Oh, Rachel.

22:14.369 --> 22:18.677
This is amazing.
I can't believe it.

22:18.677 --> 22:20.548
We just, like,
started trying.

22:20.548 --> 22:23.554
I know.
I know.

22:23.554 --> 22:25.190
Oh, come here.

22:34.209 --> 22:35.578
I think it's twins.

22:35.578 --> 22:36.580
Oh, no.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.216
No, it's just one.

22:41.356 --> 22:44.262
<i>The baby was all
Toby thought about.</i>

22:44.262 --> 22:46.233
<i>He wanted to play
classical music for her</i>

22:46.233 --> 22:48.537
<i>so she'd come out a cellist.</i>

22:48.537 --> 22:50.741
<i>He wanted to feed Rachel
folic-acid-rich foods</i>

22:50.741 --> 22:53.547
<i>so the baby would come out
a junior at Stanford.</i>

22:58.758 --> 23:00.595
Hi, where have you been?

23:00.595 --> 23:02.331
What are you,
the Gestapo?

23:02.331 --> 23:03.300
What? No.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.402
I just--
I tried you a few times.

23:04.402 --> 23:05.938
I couldn't get a cab
in the rain.

23:05.938 --> 23:08.677
Oh, my God. Look at you.
You're soaking wet.

23:08.677 --> 23:11.249
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

23:11.249 --> 23:12.819
Okay, come on in.

23:18.463 --> 23:22.438
Honey, do you want
to tell me what happened?

23:27.648 --> 23:29.419
I was passed over.

23:31.790 --> 23:33.594
Sorry, what?
Who? Who got it?

23:33.594 --> 23:35.163
Harry, of course.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.469
No. Stop it.
You deserved it.

23:37.469 --> 23:39.606
Hey, come here.

23:39.606 --> 23:41.276
Okay. Here.

23:41.276 --> 23:42.746
Here, come on.
What are you doing?

23:42.746 --> 23:44.282
I'm not a baby, Toby.
You're soaking. Come on.

23:44.282 --> 23:45.919
I can undress myself. Okay.

23:45.919 --> 23:47.488
Okay.

23:47.488 --> 23:49.826
It's not about deserving it.
I'm being punished.

23:49.826 --> 23:51.463
What do you mean?

23:54.970 --> 23:57.408
Matt Klein hit on me
two years ago.

23:59.246 --> 24:00.814
What?
Matt Klein, your boss?

24:00.814 --> 24:02.485
Yes, the only
Matt Klein I know.

24:02.485 --> 24:04.589
Ech.
Oh.

24:04.589 --> 24:06.025
God.
When? How?

24:06.025 --> 24:07.662
It was that party
two years ago.

24:07.662 --> 24:08.765
What party?

24:08.765 --> 24:10.467
The Christmas party.

24:10.467 --> 24:14.610
Eh...
With the ice sculptures.

24:14.610 --> 24:16.280
Oh.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.217
Really?
Oh, God.

24:18.217 --> 24:19.453
I was there for that.
I was there for that.

24:19.453 --> 24:20.855
No, it's--
it's his thing.

24:20.855 --> 24:22.392
Oh, it's his thing?
Of course.

24:22.392 --> 24:23.728
No, it's his thing, like--
like-- like rollerblading

24:23.728 --> 24:25.764
can be your thing,
or French pastry making.

24:25.764 --> 24:26.867
Of course.
It's a hobby.
W-W--

24:26.867 --> 24:27.969
Whatever.

24:27.969 --> 24:29.673
But I-I said no,

24:29.673 --> 24:32.645
and I was worried
it was gonna be awkward,

24:32.645 --> 24:34.649
but then I thought
things were normal,

24:34.649 --> 24:37.288
and I-I respected him
for that, you know?

24:37.288 --> 24:38.624
Really?
Are you-- Are you--

24:38.624 --> 24:40.461
I-I can't believe
I was there for that.

24:40.461 --> 24:42.331
Of course, I remember we were
standing by Harry's office,

24:42.331 --> 24:43.801
and he came over
and he said,

24:43.801 --> 24:45.338
"Hey, do you mind
if I borrow our girl here?"

24:45.338 --> 24:46.740
Our girl.
Like you're ours.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.410
- It's how people talk, Toby.
- No, it's not.

24:48.410 --> 24:49.846
It's how people
sexually harass you.

24:49.846 --> 24:51.216
God, of course.
I remember.

24:51.216 --> 24:52.686
He put his hand on
the small of your back,

24:52.686 --> 24:54.388
and I remember thinking
it was so crazy,

24:54.388 --> 24:55.691
but I didn't want to say
anything 'cause I didn't want

24:55.691 --> 24:57.061
to sound patriarchal.
I'm an idiot.

24:57.061 --> 24:58.697
He was playing
the long game.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.768
He-- He was promoting me
just enough so I wouldn't sue.

25:00.768 --> 25:02.839
Jesus, Harry Sacks
hasn't closed a deal in months.

25:02.839 --> 25:04.543
And he knows you have a husband,
and here I am at home,

25:04.543 --> 25:06.413
making soup like an asshole,
not expecting any of this.

25:06.413 --> 25:07.849
It was retribution,
all of it.

25:07.849 --> 25:09.753
He was angry I hadn't told him
I was pregnant.

25:09.753 --> 25:11.390
He was angry I didn't
want to fuck him.

25:11.390 --> 25:13.025
Yeah, did you remind Matt
that you have a husband?

25:13.025 --> 25:14.763
That's he's met me?
That he knows me?
Remind him.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.533
Can we deal with how this
is all about you later?

25:16.533 --> 25:19.238
I'm still focused on the
"this happened to me" thing.

25:21.543 --> 25:23.079
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

25:23.079 --> 25:25.751
I'm just, like...
I'm just, like, in shock.

25:25.751 --> 25:27.087
Sorry.

25:27.087 --> 25:28.391
Yeah, let me get you
some soup.

25:28.391 --> 25:29.559
No, I don't want soup.
I-I want Tony's.

25:29.559 --> 25:30.995
I want linguini
in clam sauce.

25:30.995 --> 25:32.765
No, you're not supposed
to have clams.

25:36.071 --> 25:37.675
But you can,
if you want to.

25:41.015 --> 25:42.384
Hi. Um...

25:42.384 --> 25:44.922
Uh, we're going
to 82nd and 2nd.

25:44.922 --> 25:46.560
Thanks.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.297
You know,
it stopped raining.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.066
We could've walked.
I didn't want to walk.

25:50.066 --> 25:51.469
Oh. No, I get it.

25:51.469 --> 25:54.910
I mean, it's been
a-a rough night.

25:54.910 --> 25:58.116
No, I'm saying
for good.

25:58.116 --> 25:59.953
I'm tired of long walks.
I don't like them.

25:59.953 --> 26:01.756
It's a waste of my time.

26:04.830 --> 26:08.470
<i>The Fleishmans never went
on a long walk again.</i>

26:11.943 --> 26:14.316
<i>Five months later, Rachel
was admitted to the hospital</i>

26:14.316 --> 26:15.784
<i>with high blood pressure.</i>

26:15.784 --> 26:17.788
<i>She was given Pitocin
for an induction,</i>

26:17.788 --> 26:19.292
<i>but 14 hours in,</i>

26:19.292 --> 26:21.195
<i>she hadn't progressed
beyond two centimeters.</i>

26:21.195 --> 26:23.967
Just try to picture
dilation, okay?

26:23.967 --> 26:26.941
Open waters.
Open fields.

26:26.941 --> 26:28.109
Sunrise.
Shut up.

26:28.109 --> 26:30.514
Please, just shut up.

26:34.956 --> 26:36.993
Uh, who is he?
Who...

26:36.993 --> 26:37.962
Sorry, who are you?
Who are you?

26:37.962 --> 26:39.499
I'm Dr. Romalino.

26:39.499 --> 26:40.801
Sorry, where's--
where's Dr. Goldberg?

26:40.801 --> 26:43.340
Dr. Goldberg is in Hawaii
for the week.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.645
No. No.
I-I want my regular doctor.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.482
Yeah, it's okay.
Hi, I'm Dr. Fleishman.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.050
I'm a-- I'm a resident
up on gastro.

26:49.050 --> 26:50.822
Nice to meet you.
I'm who you got.

26:50.822 --> 26:52.123
Can I see her chart?

26:52.123 --> 26:53.827
Do you have absolutely
no pull here?

26:53.827 --> 26:55.364
You work here.

26:57.969 --> 27:00.139
We heard you were here.

27:00.139 --> 27:02.143
Away.
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

27:02.143 --> 27:03.680
Hey. Guys, hi.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.082
Thank you so much for coming.

27:05.082 --> 27:06.553
Um, yeah, here.
Come over here.

27:06.553 --> 27:08.155
This is not exactly
the laugh riot

27:08.155 --> 27:10.092
that they promised us.
This is how it goes.

27:10.092 --> 27:12.030
You remember the OB,
with the, uh...

27:12.030 --> 27:13.467
Husband who was
the dancer?

27:13.467 --> 27:15.537
Oh, yes.
Uh, "and all that jazz."

27:15.537 --> 27:16.973
Listen-- I gotta go,
but hey, listen, really,

27:16.973 --> 27:18.377
thank you so much for this.

27:18.377 --> 27:19.679
Good luck.
Thank you.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.148
Bye.

27:21.148 --> 27:23.052
Get him away from me.
What-- What--
What happened?

27:23.052 --> 27:24.823
He did something!
Get him out!

27:24.823 --> 27:27.795
Okay, I think we might need
to get psych in here.

27:27.795 --> 27:29.999
What-- What did you do?
What happened?

27:29.999 --> 27:32.805
Are you planning on being
a baby, or delivering a baby?

27:32.805 --> 27:34.509
Hold on a minute.
That's not how you
talk to a patient.

27:34.509 --> 27:36.846
What? A patient?
What...

27:38.717 --> 27:41.088
<i>Toby later found out
what had happened.</i>

27:41.088 --> 27:43.994
<i>The doctor had intentionally
ruptured her membrane</i>

27:43.994 --> 27:47.301
<i>and broken her water
without her consent.</i>

27:47.301 --> 27:49.706
<i>Anyone could have
predicted the rest.</i>

27:54.883 --> 27:56.653
Okay.
Thank you.

27:56.653 --> 27:58.022
Okay.

27:58.022 --> 27:59.759
Is it okay?

27:59.759 --> 28:02.531
The head.
Yes, of course. Yeah.

28:02.531 --> 28:03.901
Thank you so much.

28:03.901 --> 28:05.872
Hi, honey.

28:05.872 --> 28:09.177
<i>He understood then that this
wasn't just a bad delivery.</i>

28:09.177 --> 28:11.416
<i>She was hurt.</i>

28:11.416 --> 28:14.087
<i>That night, he wanted
to kill the doctor</i>

28:14.087 --> 28:15.891
<i>for what he'd done to Rachel,</i>

28:15.891 --> 28:20.534
<i>but someone had
to watch the baby.</i>

28:20.534 --> 28:23.406
You should hold her.

28:23.406 --> 28:26.546
How can I hold the baby
when I can't feel my legs?

28:38.269 --> 28:39.972
You really should
hold her now.

28:43.112 --> 28:44.081
Okay.
Give her to me.

28:44.081 --> 28:45.550
Okay.

28:48.757 --> 28:49.992
Okay.

29:08.842 --> 29:11.069
<i>Toby waited for things
to get back to normal.</i>

29:11.069 --> 29:14.208
<i>His family visited,
excited to meet the new baby,</i>

29:14.208 --> 29:16.056
<i>but Rachel felt compelled</i>

29:16.056 --> 29:17.840
<i>to tell each visitor
about the birth.</i>

29:17.840 --> 29:21.494
Well, our usual doctor
was in Hawaii, of course.

29:21.494 --> 29:25.402
And so, I'm propped there,
I'm writhing in pain,

29:25.402 --> 29:27.940
when this guy--
he takes his hands

29:27.940 --> 29:31.581
and he tells me he's only
gonna examine me, but the minute

29:31.581 --> 29:34.553
Toby leaves the room,
he starts to examine me,

29:34.553 --> 29:38.795
but he's not--
he's not really examining me.

29:38.795 --> 29:40.666
Like, he's doing something.

29:40.666 --> 29:43.204
Like, it--
Like, it hurts, you know?

29:46.511 --> 29:48.849
And then he broke my water.

29:48.849 --> 29:50.920
Not-- Not a word to me.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.556
Nothing.
Terrible.

29:52.556 --> 29:53.491
That's terrible.

29:53.491 --> 29:54.927
No, it was.
It was terrible.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.702
And then, while his hands
were up inside me,

29:58.702 --> 29:59.970
I kicked the doctor,

29:59.970 --> 30:04.113
and he went flying across
the room to the wall.

30:04.113 --> 30:05.649
<i>It wasn't true.</i>

30:05.649 --> 30:07.586
<i>Toby wanted to ask her
why she said it,</i>

30:07.586 --> 30:09.357
<i>but she seemed too delicate.</i>

30:09.357 --> 30:10.926
<i>She was wearing the same
pair of sweatpants</i>

30:10.926 --> 30:13.798
<i>since she'd gotten home,
so he let it be.</i>

30:13.798 --> 30:15.635
Here you go.

30:15.635 --> 30:17.472
Hi, honey. Mm!

30:17.472 --> 30:19.010
God, what a nice thing
to see you two

30:19.010 --> 30:20.512
in the middle
of the day.

30:22.650 --> 30:26.057
They were in
my prenatal yoga.

30:26.057 --> 30:28.829
You want to go over?

30:28.829 --> 30:31.367
Where'd they learn to play
with their babies like that?

30:31.367 --> 30:34.039
They didn't teach us
that in the class.

30:34.039 --> 30:35.709
<i>Something was very wrong.</i>

30:40.652 --> 30:42.690
She's not smiling yet,
and the--

30:42.690 --> 30:44.560
the book said
that at six weeks--

30:44.560 --> 30:46.998
Well, smiling's
an imitative behavior.

30:46.998 --> 30:49.670
So, you have to be smiled at
in order to smile back.

30:52.176 --> 30:53.912
Are you smiling
at her?

30:53.912 --> 30:55.682
Yeah. Yeah.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.594
Have you talked
to someone?

31:01.594 --> 31:03.532
Yeah, I know.
I keep telling her.

31:03.532 --> 31:05.769
You have to take care
of yourself here, Rachel.

31:05.769 --> 31:07.373
It's like they say
on the airplane--

31:07.373 --> 31:09.510
in an emergency, you secure
your own oxygen mask

31:09.510 --> 31:11.014
before you secure
the children's.

31:11.014 --> 31:13.885
You can't help them
if you can't breathe yourself.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.432
Hey.
I ruined her.

31:20.432 --> 31:22.069
No. Stop that.
Stop that.

31:22.069 --> 31:23.571
Don't...
Honey, don't say that.

31:23.571 --> 31:24.840
Seriously.
This is normal.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.944
Like, a lot of mothers
go through this.

31:30.719 --> 31:34.327
You know, you a--
you actually should go.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.531
You know how I feel
about therapy.
I do know.

31:36.531 --> 31:38.234
Rachel, that is like--
it's so archaic, honey.

31:38.234 --> 31:39.970
It's for rich people--

31:39.970 --> 31:41.975
...who don't even realize
they don't have problems.

31:41.975 --> 31:43.211
Yes, I know.
I know.

31:43.211 --> 31:46.617
But you--
can you just try it?

31:46.617 --> 31:48.889
God.

31:48.889 --> 31:50.225
Fine. Fine.

31:50.225 --> 31:51.995
I'll go, okay?

31:51.995 --> 31:53.932
God, you're like
the Gestapo.

31:53.932 --> 31:55.435
No, I'm-- I'm not.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.906
That's not really how
the Gestapo worked, honey.

31:57.906 --> 32:01.180
<i>He knew what was happening
to her wasn't in her control,</i>

32:01.180 --> 32:03.251
<i>and he didn't blame her.</i>

32:03.251 --> 32:05.990
<i>But she was really missing out.</i>

32:05.990 --> 32:07.792
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

32:11.934 --> 32:14.640
Shh, shh, shh.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.044
Hey.

32:16.044 --> 32:17.780
How was it?

32:17.780 --> 32:20.052
Fine.

32:20.052 --> 32:23.491
I don't love sharing in groups,
but yeah, it was fine.

32:23.491 --> 32:26.130
Whatever.

32:28.268 --> 32:30.438
No, I-I'm not
talking about it.

32:30.438 --> 32:32.009
If you're gonna make me go there
and talk about it

32:32.009 --> 32:33.945
and then I have to talk to you
about talking about it,

32:33.945 --> 32:36.117
you can kill me now.

32:36.117 --> 32:38.021
Hm. Okay.
Well, I'm just...

32:38.021 --> 32:40.626
happy to hear it worked.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.863
You can go again Thursday.

32:54.019 --> 32:56.023
Hello? Rachel?

32:58.628 --> 33:01.467
Have you been out
at all today?

33:03.871 --> 33:06.945
Have I?

33:06.945 --> 33:09.416
No.

33:09.416 --> 33:12.622
I thought you were
doing better.

33:12.622 --> 33:16.197
No, I am.
I'm just-- I'm...

33:16.197 --> 33:18.501
I'm so tired.

33:19.202 --> 33:20.872
And I feel like--
I don't know.

33:20.872 --> 33:26.350
I feel like I'm in the...
the wrong gear or something.

33:26.350 --> 33:28.087
Hey, listen,
I have to say this.

33:28.087 --> 33:30.158
I think you should
see someone.

33:30.158 --> 33:31.327
A therapist.

33:31.327 --> 33:33.531
Not-- Not
a support group, okay?

33:33.531 --> 33:36.503
But a person, and maybe
even a psychiatrist.

33:36.503 --> 33:38.374
They have medications--
No, enough about therapy.

33:38.374 --> 33:39.843
Toby, I don't need therapy.

33:39.843 --> 33:43.017
What I need is help
with this baby.

33:44.353 --> 33:46.057
Oh.

33:46.057 --> 33:47.225
Well, then, that's okay.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.363
That's great.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.567
Let's get us a nanny.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.283
So, uh, Raya Edelman
said you're just great.

33:59.283 --> 34:01.053
Mm-hmm.
Her children are beautiful.

34:01.053 --> 34:02.389
But they're older now.

34:02.389 --> 34:03.858
Well, it's really nice
that you get to help out.

34:03.858 --> 34:05.028
Right, Rach?

34:05.028 --> 34:06.697
It's an amazing thing
to see children grow.

34:06.697 --> 34:09.103
It's a privilege. Mm.

34:09.103 --> 34:11.040
Ooh.
May I hold her?

34:18.088 --> 34:19.089
It's okay.
It's okay.

34:19.089 --> 34:22.262
Sorry, that is amazing.
How did you do that?

34:22.262 --> 34:23.965
I have a calm energy.

34:23.965 --> 34:25.601
Huh.

34:27.706 --> 34:29.910
Well, I think
you're hired.

34:35.689 --> 34:37.959
<i>And things seemed to get
better from there.</i>

34:40.765 --> 34:43.604
<i>And then, just over
a month later...</i>

34:47.079 --> 34:48.281
Mona.

34:48.281 --> 34:50.017
Hello, Mr. Toby.

34:50.017 --> 34:51.053
Where's Rachel?

34:51.053 --> 34:52.122
She went out.

34:52.122 --> 34:53.257
Huh.

34:55.128 --> 34:56.230
Is that formula?

34:56.230 --> 34:58.101
Yes, Mr. Toby.

34:58.101 --> 35:00.005
Okay.

35:00.005 --> 35:01.774
Alright.

35:01.774 --> 35:03.411
I got her. Yeah.

35:03.411 --> 35:05.648
Thank you so much.

35:05.648 --> 35:08.455
Okay, well,
have a good night, okay?

35:08.455 --> 35:10.359
<i>It turned out,
earlier that morning,</i>

35:10.359 --> 35:11.995
<i>after Toby left for work,</i>

35:11.995 --> 35:15.535
<i>Rachel had decided that
her maternity leave was over.</i>

35:15.535 --> 35:18.107
<i>She decided to leave
Alfooz & Lichtenstein,</i>

35:18.107 --> 35:21.447
<i>raid its staff,
poach its most bankable client,</i>

35:21.447 --> 35:23.784
<i>and start a whole new agency.</i>

35:23.784 --> 35:25.622
<i>She stayed out until 4:00 AM
that night</i>

35:25.622 --> 35:27.692
<i>with her new employees
at 8-1/2,</i>

35:27.692 --> 35:30.865
<i>celebrating the creation
of Fleishman & Company,</i>

35:30.865 --> 35:32.803
<i>a new theater-focused agency</i>

35:32.803 --> 35:34.773
<i>that was small enough
to give its clients</i>

35:34.773 --> 35:37.981
<i>the attention they needed
to be able to thrive.</i>

35:37.981 --> 35:40.418
<i>This product,
whether you wipe in circles</i>

35:40.418 --> 35:42.122
<i>or in streaks, what have you,</i>

35:42.122 --> 35:44.926
<i>it will stake off any streaks,
any smudges,</i>

35:44.926 --> 35:47.433
<i>any dirt that you have,
and it does it with ease.</i>

35:47.433 --> 35:49.136
<i>Does not even require...</i>

35:49.136 --> 35:51.774
You changed.

35:51.774 --> 35:53.978
<i>And that was that.</i>

35:53.978 --> 35:56.944
<i>Meanwhile, Toby's career
was continuing apace,</i>

35:56.944 --> 35:59.682
<i>but his support of his wife's
ambition was costing him.</i>

35:59.682 --> 36:01.451
<i>He couldn't take the lead
on research.</i>

36:01.451 --> 36:03.789
<i>He couldn't have drinks with
the other doctors after work,</i>

36:03.789 --> 36:05.560
<i>so that he could go home
and relieve Mona.</i>

36:05.560 --> 36:07.264
<i>It felt like
everyone around him</i>

36:07.264 --> 36:10.135
<i>was catapulting
somehow higher and faster.</i>

36:10.135 --> 36:12.841
<i>He'd heard his old med school
rival, Aaron Schwartz,</i>

36:12.841 --> 36:14.979
<i>had made subdivision head
at Methodist.</i>

36:14.979 --> 36:16.782
<i>But Aaron Schwartz
didn't have a wife</i>

36:16.782 --> 36:18.686
<i>who saw three new
Broadway shows premiere</i>

36:18.686 --> 36:21.025
<i>the same year
she delivered a second child.</i>

36:21.025 --> 36:23.328
<i>Aaron Schwartz didn't get
to take pride</i>

36:23.328 --> 36:24.664
<i>in watching someone he loved</i>

36:24.664 --> 36:27.136
<i>build something massive
and important.</i>

36:27.136 --> 36:28.305
<i>Toby felt lucky.</i>

36:28.305 --> 36:29.474
<i>Not because of the money.</i>

36:29.474 --> 36:31.312
<i>That wasn't important to him.</i>

36:31.312 --> 36:34.351
<i>But because he got to spend
this time with his kids.</i>

36:34.351 --> 36:36.721
<i>They had these great kids.</i>

36:36.721 --> 36:38.492
<i>He worried Rachel would
look back on this time</i>

36:38.492 --> 36:40.263
<i>and regret it.</i>

36:40.263 --> 36:41.298
Oh, my God!

36:41.298 --> 36:43.303
Can you guys keep it down?

36:46.275 --> 36:46.913
<i>Maybe.</i>

36:51.906 --> 36:53.530
It's a preschool interview.

36:53.530 --> 36:55.526
Why does this have to be
a bloodsport

36:55.526 --> 36:56.419
like everything else
that you touch?

36:56.419 --> 36:57.288
It's a kindergarten interview.

36:57.288 --> 36:58.724
Mm.
It's serious.

36:58.724 --> 36:59.960
This is where her future
gets determined.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.396
Okay.
You have to be someone.

37:01.396 --> 37:03.367
You have to show
you come from somewhere.

37:03.367 --> 37:05.237
Mm.
So, uh, what's our story?

37:05.237 --> 37:06.840
Our story? I don't know.
That we're good people?

37:06.840 --> 37:08.577
That we'll pay
their ridiculous tuition?

37:08.577 --> 37:09.346
I don't know.
Oh, come on. Really.

37:09.346 --> 37:11.016
I mean it. Be serious.

37:11.016 --> 37:12.218
Okay.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.428
Uh, yes, yes.

37:17.428 --> 37:20.334
No, no, no.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm here.

37:20.334 --> 37:22.940
You have to go with your gut,
Alex. You just do.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.344
I mean, look what your gut
has given the world so far.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.015
Hey, we're in the middle
of something.

37:27.015 --> 37:29.052
Okay.

37:29.052 --> 37:30.421
Uh, no, no.

37:30.421 --> 37:32.191
No, let's...
let's figure it out.

37:32.191 --> 37:34.997
Okay, so, you've got-- you've
got these two characters

37:34.997 --> 37:37.402
who are not only trying
to overcome this--

37:37.402 --> 37:38.905
Alright, I'm going
to the gym.

37:38.905 --> 37:40.741
They're-- They're
inside a world

37:40.741 --> 37:43.380
that's changing faster
than they want it to, right?

37:45.884 --> 37:47.722
So, did you go to school
in New York?

37:47.722 --> 37:50.261
Uh, just for college.
I grew up in Baltimore.

37:50.261 --> 37:51.629
Baltimore?

37:53.100 --> 37:55.738
Hi.
Is this Toby?

37:55.738 --> 37:57.007
This is Toby.

37:57.007 --> 37:58.410
Rachel tells me
you're a doctor.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.083
Mm-hmm.
Good for you.

38:01.083 --> 38:04.088
Hi. Oh, thanks.
This is Rachel's husband, Toby.

38:04.088 --> 38:05.257
He's a doctor.

38:05.257 --> 38:06.393
Oh, a doctor.

38:06.393 --> 38:08.363
Good for you.

38:08.363 --> 38:11.737
So, we're gonna go upstairs.
We'll start with refreshments.

38:11.737 --> 38:13.908
God, does a 5-year-old
really need all this?

38:13.908 --> 38:16.146
Just look around here. Like...

38:16.146 --> 38:18.050
Hi.

38:18.050 --> 38:19.921
This is a place
where they'll thrive.

38:19.921 --> 38:22.225
Look at this place.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

38:22.225 --> 38:25.431
I keep thinking, like,
what would have happened to me

38:25.431 --> 38:26.800
if I had gone
to a school like this?

38:26.800 --> 38:28.570
I-I would have had a place
in the world.

38:28.570 --> 38:30.041
Yeah, I know.
I just don't know if they need

38:30.041 --> 38:31.911
to be in such an elitist world.
You came from nothing.

38:31.911 --> 38:33.380
Look at what an ambition
monster you are.

38:33.380 --> 38:34.883
Maybe you're only successful
because you came from nothing.

38:34.883 --> 38:36.086
I don't know.
Did you ever think of that?

38:36.086 --> 38:38.023
That's what you want
for our kids?

38:38.023 --> 38:40.527
To be forced into my
<i>Great Expectations</i> upbringing

38:40.527 --> 38:42.098
in order to give them
character?

38:42.098 --> 38:43.634
No, thanks.
I don't need all this character.

38:43.634 --> 38:44.602
Who would you be
in <i>Great Expectations?</i>

38:44.602 --> 38:45.939
Sorry, would you be Pip?

38:45.939 --> 38:47.074
Would you be
the street urchin, Pip?

38:47.074 --> 38:48.777
Toby, how can you
argue with me

38:48.777 --> 38:50.480
wanting for them
to have everything?

38:50.480 --> 38:52.986
Yeah, this isn't
everything.

38:52.986 --> 38:55.057
Look, okay, I know you want
them to have roots,

38:55.057 --> 38:56.460
and if you think
this would--

38:56.460 --> 38:59.099
I just-- I just want them
to be safe in the world.

38:59.099 --> 39:01.536
I want them to not have
such a hard time.

39:01.536 --> 39:02.940
Rachel, how much safer
can they get?

39:02.940 --> 39:04.810
Don't you see this
is why I do all of this?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.546
I do what I do so they
can have all this.

39:06.546 --> 39:08.784
I feel like you're not even
trying to convince me anymore.

39:08.784 --> 39:10.321
I feel like you're just
telling me how it is.

39:10.321 --> 39:11.623
No, that's not true.

39:11.623 --> 39:14.964
Okay, I believe in public school
as a value.

39:14.964 --> 39:16.499
You're trying to make me say
that I don't,

39:16.499 --> 39:17.969
and I'm not
falling for it.

39:20.474 --> 39:22.045
Alright.

39:22.045 --> 39:24.549
Alright, whatever
you want, Rachel.

39:24.549 --> 39:26.152
Really.

39:26.152 --> 39:27.488
Thank you.

39:27.488 --> 39:29.191
Really.
Okay.

39:32.232 --> 39:34.102
Um... Oh.

39:38.143 --> 39:40.381
I'm, uh, Rachel Fleishman.
We have, uh--

39:40.381 --> 39:44.055
We have two kids who I think
would just be so happy here.

39:46.659 --> 39:48.630
<i>Rachel couldn't compete
with donations</i>

39:48.630 --> 39:50.902
<i>or her name on classrooms,</i>

39:50.902 --> 39:52.471
<i>and she hadn't gone
to the same country clubs</i>

39:52.471 --> 39:54.208
<i>and tennis camps
that all the other parents</i>

39:54.208 --> 39:57.348
<i>seemed to have gone to together
when they were children.</i>

39:57.348 --> 40:01.189
<i>But that didn't stop her from
using what she could to climb.</i>

40:01.189 --> 40:04.629
<i>She bought their friendship,
one house seat at a time.</i>

40:06.733 --> 40:08.671
<i>Then it was 10 years
of small moments</i>

40:08.671 --> 40:10.374
<i>that added up to a lot.</i>

40:14.415 --> 40:15.785
<i>Rachel became more consumed</i>

40:15.785 --> 40:17.788
<i>by her drive
for wealth and success</i>

40:17.788 --> 40:21.262
<i>until he didn't
recognize her anymore.</i>

40:21.262 --> 40:23.901
<i>Or himself.</i>

40:23.901 --> 40:25.838
<i>Toby liked to say that the end
of his marriage</i>

40:25.838 --> 40:27.608
<i>happened like
the fall of Rome.</i>

40:27.608 --> 40:31.283
<i>Slowly, then all at once.</i>

40:31.283 --> 40:33.453
<i>This was the night
of "all at once."</i>

40:33.453 --> 40:36.526
♪ And so it was

40:36.526 --> 40:40.401
♪ That I came to travel

40:40.401 --> 40:43.007
♪ Upon a road

40:43.007 --> 40:47.415
♪ That was thorned and narrow

40:47.415 --> 40:49.285
♪ Another place

40:51.356 --> 40:52.658
♪ Another grace

40:52.658 --> 40:54.095
Philadelphia?
Yes.

40:54.095 --> 40:55.831
The head of the department.
The top.

40:55.831 --> 40:57.134
What happened
to "patient interface"?

40:57.134 --> 40:58.737
It would mean a lot
more money for me.

40:58.737 --> 41:00.441
You know, you're always saying
you want me to make more money.

41:00.441 --> 41:01.977
Well, we would live
like kings in Philly.

41:01.977 --> 41:03.414
Just outside Philadelphia.

41:03.414 --> 41:04.615
Doing what exactly?

41:04.615 --> 41:06.719
I'm a talent agent.
For theater.

41:06.719 --> 41:08.423
It might be
the change we need.

41:08.423 --> 41:11.029
I mean, this is too--
You're working too much, Rach.

41:11.029 --> 41:12.732
I have an agency.
I have employees.

41:12.732 --> 41:14.235
Well, something
has to change.

41:14.235 --> 41:15.972
You're never here.
The kids don't see you.

41:15.972 --> 41:17.808
Last week, when Solly
had the state report--

41:17.808 --> 41:20.581
No, no, do not bring up
the state report. Please.

41:20.581 --> 41:22.051
I love my work.

41:22.051 --> 41:23.654
I've built
something I love.

41:23.654 --> 41:25.290
Do you understand that?

41:25.290 --> 41:28.230
To take that away from me
because you want what?

41:28.230 --> 41:30.067
More attention?
What? No. Excuse me.

41:30.067 --> 41:32.705
I want what's best for us, okay?
Oh, what a coincidence.

41:32.705 --> 41:34.408
That means choosing
what's best for you.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.312
Alright.

41:36.312 --> 41:38.784
I'm-- I'm happy.

41:38.784 --> 41:40.821
We finally have
a real apartment.

41:40.821 --> 41:42.258
Our kids are in
a feeder school.

41:42.258 --> 41:44.161
My-- My job is infinitely
more rewarding

41:44.161 --> 41:46.666
than being sexually harassed
by a middle-management dipshit.

41:46.666 --> 41:49.806
I run the largest small theater
agency in all of New York.

41:49.806 --> 41:51.310
No, you couldn't--

41:51.310 --> 41:54.115
you couldn't understand how--
how rare and important that is

41:54.115 --> 41:56.152
because your entire life
has been laid out for you.

41:56.152 --> 41:57.788
Ah. The greatest hits. No.

41:57.788 --> 41:58.757
Med school, intern,
resident--

41:58.757 --> 41:59.759
...fellow, attending.

41:59.759 --> 42:01.463
Yeah.

42:01.463 --> 42:03.733
You don't have to strategize
or plan or make connections.

42:03.733 --> 42:05.604
The system does that
for you.

42:05.604 --> 42:07.008
I don't have that luxury.

42:07.008 --> 42:09.612
Everything I have,
I've had to scratch for.

42:09.612 --> 42:11.182
I mean, even now.

42:12.752 --> 42:14.455
No, I'm not moving
anywhere, Toby.

42:14.455 --> 42:16.125
I couldn't earn this much anywhere.

42:16.125 --> 42:17.662
Yeah, well, money
doesn't buy you happiness.

42:17.662 --> 42:19.432
Oh, Toby,
of course it does!

42:21.469 --> 42:23.540
What, are you crazy?

42:25.144 --> 42:26.879
<i>He prayed she
wouldn't answer it.</i>

42:26.879 --> 42:29.452
<i>He said, "Please, God,
don't let her answer it.</i>

42:29.452 --> 42:32.358
<i>Please, God, let her find
this more important.</i>

42:32.358 --> 42:34.528
<i>Please, God, let her
find us more important.</i>

42:34.528 --> 42:37.468
<i>Please, God, let her find me
more important."</i>

42:39.672 --> 42:41.409
Rachel Fleishman.

42:44.348 --> 42:46.319
God damn it.

42:46.319 --> 42:47.721
Amazing.

42:47.721 --> 42:49.859
- Is that oregano?
- Um...

42:49.859 --> 42:52.164
Uh, marjoram.
Oh!

42:52.164 --> 42:54.335
With a-a touch
of tarragon.

42:54.335 --> 42:55.671
I'd love to see <i>you</i>
make a meal.

42:55.671 --> 42:56.640
Well, it is so good.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.143
Hey, did anyone figure out

42:58.143 --> 43:00.548
if the USY summer thing
is still bad?

43:00.548 --> 43:02.484
I thought you might have
a little more self-respect

43:02.484 --> 43:04.388
than making sure everybdy knows
you cooked the meal.

43:04.388 --> 43:06.359
Yeah, but I did
cook the meal.

43:06.359 --> 43:07.495
I could cook a meal if I didn't
have to work day and night.

43:07.495 --> 43:08.864
I cooked to impress
your stupid friends

43:08.864 --> 43:10.401
and you're still disappointed.

43:10.401 --> 43:11.937
You know, I just realized,
you don't even know

43:11.937 --> 43:13.172
you're trying
to humiliate me.

43:13.172 --> 43:14.575
Do you guys need help
in there?

43:14.575 --> 43:15.912
No, thanks.
Almost got it.

43:15.912 --> 43:17.381
You know what? Why don't you
put the dessert out,

43:17.381 --> 43:19.385
because you worked
so fucking hard on it?

43:21.422 --> 43:23.427
Mine is
George Stephanopoulos.

43:23.427 --> 43:24.897
His is Naomi Campbell.

43:24.897 --> 43:26.399
Whoa. Still?

43:26.399 --> 43:28.203
She must be, what,
in her 50s?

43:28.203 --> 43:29.839
40s.
60s!

43:31.409 --> 43:33.547
Well, mine is
Mark Wahlberg. Gross.

43:33.547 --> 43:35.117
You see what I have
to deal with here?

43:35.117 --> 43:37.554
No, there is something
about him. I could save him.

43:37.554 --> 43:39.692
Guy's a fast-food billionaire.
He doesn't need to be saved.

43:39.692 --> 43:40.827
Okay. No.

43:40.827 --> 43:43.600
Mine used to be
Ariana Grande.

43:43.600 --> 43:45.103
- Okay.
- Hmm.

43:45.103 --> 43:46.706
I just like someone who looks
like she's a little too good

43:46.706 --> 43:48.210
for me, you know?

43:48.210 --> 43:49.913
Like my beautiful
wifey here.

43:49.913 --> 43:51.550
Mm, you're just
saying that so

43:51.550 --> 43:53.420
I'll forget your free pass
is an actual child.

43:53.420 --> 43:56.259
Do you have anyone
who is of a normal age?

43:56.259 --> 43:58.130
She's in her 20s.
She just looks younger.

43:58.130 --> 43:59.699
Is that supposed
to be better?

43:59.699 --> 44:00.834
Ooh.

44:00.834 --> 44:02.404
Who's your free pass,
Rachel?

44:02.404 --> 44:04.108
What do you mean?
Free pass.

44:04.108 --> 44:06.279
Who you would sleep with
if Toby turned a blind eye.

44:06.279 --> 44:08.952
Oh, God. This is what
we're talking about?

44:08.952 --> 44:11.422
Come on.
We've all answered.

44:13.726 --> 44:15.932
Sam Rothberg.

44:15.932 --> 44:18.236
Oh.

44:18.236 --> 44:20.441
What? What?
What did I say that's wrong?

44:20.441 --> 44:21.509
Ah!

44:21.509 --> 44:24.115
Okay, you're supposed
to pick a celebrity.

44:24.115 --> 44:25.784
You're not supposed
to pick someone you know.

44:25.784 --> 44:29.592
Suddenly, Ariana Grande
doesn't seem so bad, huh?

44:29.592 --> 44:32.298
It's fine.

44:32.298 --> 44:34.802
So, uh, what should
we discuss next?

44:34.802 --> 44:36.840
Politics or religion?

44:36.840 --> 44:39.178
Stop. Stop.

44:39.178 --> 44:41.282
This looks fabulous,
you guys.

44:41.282 --> 44:43.186
Absolutely.
<i>And that was that.</i>

44:43.186 --> 44:45.657
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

44:45.657 --> 44:47.662
<i>And that's when it hit him.</i>

44:52.871 --> 44:54.842
<i>Sam Rothberg.</i>

44:54.842 --> 44:57.548
<i>Sam fucking Rothberg.</i>

45:28.710 --> 45:29.846
<i>Rachel wasn't gone.</i>

45:29.846 --> 45:31.515
<i>She wasn't in danger.</i>

45:31.515 --> 45:33.753
<i>She was with the one person
who represented</i>

45:33.753 --> 45:36.460
<i>everything Toby hated
on the Upper East Side.</i>

45:36.460 --> 45:38.463
<i>In the whole world!
She was with...</i>

45:38.463 --> 45:39.832
Sam Rothberg.
