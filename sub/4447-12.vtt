Previously on "Hellcats.."

00:02.667 --> 00:04.417
You sure school's
worth all this?

00:04.417 --> 00:06.417
Dan, I'm going to graduate,
pass the bar up north
and work in a DA's office.

00:06.417 --> 00:07.708
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:07.708 --> 00:09.209
I have one now,
for cheerleading.

00:09.209 --> 00:10.500
Cheerleading?
Whoa!

00:10.500 --> 00:12.708
(Savannah)
Hello, Marti.
Welcome to Cheertown.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.125
Charlotte.

00:14.125 --> 00:16.042
You're not actually
planning on flying

00:16.042 --> 00:17.166
at this Memp-Kris event right?

00:17.166 --> 00:18.834
- Of course, I am.
- What about the baby?

00:18.834 --> 00:20.583
- I don't have a choice.
- Suppose you did?

00:20.583 --> 00:22.458
I didn't realize there was
gonna be so many people
with cameras.

00:22.458 --> 00:24.875
(female #1)
What's your Hellcat family
gonna say when they find out?

00:24.875 --> 00:26.667
(Savannah)
I'm gonna make damn
sure they don't find out.

00:26.667 --> 00:29.792
I have to get my spot back!
You know my dad.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.542
I can't play football
like my brothers.

00:31.542 --> 00:33.583
So this is all
that I can do.'

00:33.583 --> 00:35.166
Last week Dan
and I were together.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.000
It was a mistake,
we were both drunk.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.375
(Savannah)
Shut up!

00:38.375 --> 00:40.042
I think you should find
another place

00:40.042 --> 00:41.125
to stay in Cheertown.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.750
- Lewis, let me explain.
- 'I already heard.'

00:42.750 --> 00:45.125
You made a mistake,
I made one of those with you.

01:02.167 --> 01:04.667
You ate a whole Cajun chicken,
like, a couple of miles ago.

01:04.667 --> 01:07.125
What can I say?
Working my up the food chain.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.167
Oh, come on!

01:25.250 --> 01:28.458
That trip was the worst
seven hours of my life.

01:28.458 --> 01:32.583
- No one said a word to me.
- Hope you had a good book.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.542
- Thanks for the assist.
- Yeah.

the road to being okay again?

01:43.167 --> 01:46.042
I'm sorry, Marti.
Fooled me twice, you know?

01:46.042 --> 01:47.333
Okay, if you're
still mad at me

01:47.333 --> 01:48.458
then why did you
help me just now?

01:48.458 --> 01:50.333
We're here to compete.

01:50.333 --> 01:53.667

- You're in room 112.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.375
No one wanted to bunk
with you, so it's a single.

Who's the lucky gal?

02:25.125 --> 02:29.625

Her name is Antigone.
She has daddy issues.

02:29.625 --> 02:33.084
- Oh.
- Yeah. Oh, I know.

02:33.084 --> 02:34.834
She's taking me to some
kind of poetry slam.

02:34.834 --> 02:36.208
So, I need you to watch
Marti's guitar for me.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.000
Just stick it behind
the bar or something.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.375
What are you doing with
my daughter's guitar?

02:39.375 --> 02:41.583
She left it with me while
she's away at sectionals.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.750
I was supposed to visit
Travis this afternoon.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.417
- The guy in prison?
- Yes.

02:45.417 --> 02:47.000
Marti lets him play the thing.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.917
She says it keeps
him feeling human.

02:48.917 --> 02:51.834
Oh. What, isn't he
expecting you to be there?

02:51.834 --> 02:53.041
Probably. Yes. So?

02:53.041 --> 02:54.750
Isn't he going
to be disappointed

02:54.750 --> 02:56.291

that visitation room

02:56.291 --> 03:00.167

03:05.708 --> 03:09.083
Shame on you.
The man is stuck in prison.

03:09.083 --> 03:13.125
He's probably been
looking forward to
your visit all week.

03:13.125 --> 03:15.084
He's not interested
in a visit from me.

03:15.084 --> 03:17.250
It's Marti he looks forward
to seeing. She's a hot blonde.

03:17.250 --> 03:22.000
Oh, fine, if a hot blonde
is what he wants to see

03:22.000 --> 03:24.375

nice and easy today.

have a full day

sitting with a 98.1.

04:38.042 --> 04:39.500

or body temperature?

04:39.500 --> 04:42.209
Can we refrain from
the immature jokes?

04:42.209 --> 04:44.125
Fine. I'll just stand
here in mute silence.

04:44.125 --> 04:45.625
That'll be great.
Thanks, Marti.

we've to pull off
the routine of our lives.

- Zero margin for error.
- No pressure.

Of course, we can do that.
Positive outcomes only. Whoo!

let's do this! Aah!

all the way through.

05:52.583 --> 05:53.667
And I'll be in the back like

05:55.792 --> 05:57.417
Alright, you heard Vanessa.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.333

Yeah, yeah.

Wow. I didn't think
you'd actually come.

Rick's team is in town.
They're playing Kentucky.

06:23.458 --> 06:25.291
And I figured we could fly in

06:25.291 --> 06:27.917
and I could kill two of
my favorite kids
with one stone.

- Mmm.

- How's the routine?
- It's good.

seen competitive
cheerleading before.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.209

how well you fly.'

06:47.209 --> 06:49.250
Yeah, I was a cheerleader
in high school

06:49.250 --> 06:52.125

nothing like what you guys do.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.875
We also do floor work
and dancing.

go fly 25 feet
in the air.

07:00.166 --> 07:03.708

- Okay, Josh, I'll give you.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.291
And what about the guy
with the, uh, ponytail thing?

07:39.291 --> 07:42.084
Do you know what a ponytail
on a man says? Do you know?

07:42.084 --> 07:44.208
It says,
"I am a complete tool."

07:44.208 --> 07:46.209
Lewis is the first one
that's worth a damn.

07:46.209 --> 07:48.084
So, why don't you quit
while you're ahead.

07:48.084 --> 07:49.875
Seal the deal before
he comes to his senses

07:49.875 --> 07:52.166
and realizes there's a lot
of other pretty girls out here

07:52.166 --> 07:54.083
who are not so
high-maintenance.

07:57.042 --> 08:02.041
Honey? Aren't you going
to defend my honor?

08:02.041 --> 08:03.875
Uh..

08:03.875 --> 08:07.667
[laughs]
Well, the way I see it

08:07.667 --> 08:11.375
anything worth having is
worth taking very
good care of.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.708
- Aw.
- Thanks, baby.

08:13.708 --> 08:15.042

Hey, I got an idea.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.792
How about we take you two
out to dinner?

08:19.792 --> 08:22.166
Actually, we're in training,
right now. So, it's probably--

08:22.166 --> 08:24.959
Come on. It'll be fun,
a double date.

08:24.959 --> 08:27.083
I'm not taking "No"
for an answer, right?

08:27.083 --> 08:29.959
We're going to see you
at your motel,
7:00 p.m. sharp.

08:29.959 --> 08:32.167
We'll be waiting. Right?

08:32.167 --> 08:33.542
Um, wouldn't miss it.

08:33.542 --> 08:35.542
- Good!
- Alright!

08:35.542 --> 08:36.917
- Bye.
- Lewis!

08:36.917 --> 08:38.082
- Hey!
- See you later.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.542
Yeah.

08:43.582 --> 08:46.000
Hey.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.208
What are you doing?

08:47.208 --> 08:48.417
I had to make it
look real in case

08:48.417 --> 08:50.209
my dad looked back
over his shoulder.

08:50.209 --> 08:52.458
Not the kiss.
I-I mean, not just the kiss.

08:52.458 --> 08:55.542
What were you thinking,
lying to your dad like that?

08:55.542 --> 08:58.125
I didn't see the point of
pulling him into
all our drama.

08:58.125 --> 09:01.000
Our drama? "We"
don't have drama, Alice.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.375
You have drama, okay?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.209
And how can he not know
that we broke up?

09:04.209 --> 09:07.000
Because I chose not
to tell him.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.583
That's crazy.

09:11.708 --> 09:15.291
Suppose that I had told him
how you stomped
all over my heart.

09:15.291 --> 09:18.000
He would probably
come to hate you for
being cruel and hurtful.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.208
And when you
eventually realize

09:19.208 --> 09:20.750
what a horrible
mistake you made

09:20.750 --> 09:22.000
and we got back together

09:22.000 --> 09:25.042
he'd have a very tough
time forgiving you.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.084
Wanna know what I think?

09:27.084 --> 09:29.042
I think that you think

09:29.042 --> 09:31.083
dad's gonna be disappointed
that we broke up

09:31.083 --> 09:33.792
and that you're not flying.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.458

Alice, why don't you
just come clean?

09:48.834 --> 09:51.000
My dad is in a good mood.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.250
He's excited.
He's invested in me.

Do you have any idea
how rare that is?

09:56.583 --> 09:59.583
- Alice..
- It's just one dinner, okay?

09:59.583 --> 10:01.917
A couple of hours.

10:01.917 --> 10:06.291
And what happens tomorrow,
when he sees you
aren't flying?

on this cheerleading thing

13:43.917 --> 13:45.125
for your scholarship.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.084
But if you were to get
serious about coaching

13:48.084 --> 13:50.208

We have to get to nationals.
Alice is the safer bet.

19:49.708 --> 19:52.167
And you made this call
without consulting me?

19:52.167 --> 19:53.542
You let me make calls
like this all the time.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.834
Because I like to empower
our captain, but the minute

19:55.834 --> 19:57.166
that I think that
you're taking advantage

19:57.166 --> 19:59.042
of my trust, that can end.

19:59.042 --> 20:01.209
Marti understands that
this is best for the squad.

20:01.209 --> 20:04.125
She just stormed off
in a very understanding way.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.875
Excuse me.

20:11.209 --> 20:14.834
You wanna be the one to tell
me what just went on in there?

20:14.834 --> 20:16.542
Alice has more experience.
Just simple as that.

20:16.542 --> 20:18.125
- Mm-hmm..
- It's no big deal.

20:18.125 --> 20:21.209
I'll just sit back and
collect my scholarship.

20:21.209 --> 20:22.959
That's all
I'm here for anyway.

20:23.708 --> 20:26.000
Marti?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.834
What is really going on here?

20:32.750 --> 20:35.208
I did something
I regret with Dan.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.375
- Savannah's Dan?
- He was my Dan first.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.084
Savannah has every right
to be mad at me.

20:42.084 --> 20:43.959
And now she's got
the whole squad on her side.

20:45.209 --> 20:47.333
No one will give me
a chance to apologize

20:47.333 --> 20:49.041
or explain or anything.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.041
So..

20:54.834 --> 20:57.291
I just can't let
myself care anymore.

20:57.291 --> 20:59.291
I think you do care.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.959
But the one thing
I can't coach is desire.

21:01.959 --> 21:05.000
So, if you wanna
give up, so be it.

21:05.834 --> 21:07.209
I don't have a choice.

21:07.209 --> 21:09.125
You're as good as any
of the girls in there.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.750
I could go in there
and simply tell them
you're flying.

21:11.750 --> 21:14.000
But I don't like to
run my team that way.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.708
But if you decide that
your spot on this team

21:18.708 --> 21:20.834
in this family

21:20.834 --> 21:24.208
is worth fighting for,
I'm gonna support you.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.875
Yeah, get it.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.667
I want a cheer-off.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.208
- What?
- Alice and I.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.166
One-on-one.

21:37.166 --> 21:38.750
If she wins, I back off.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.084
But if I win, I fly.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.000
Sadly, I'm not interested.

This isn't about you, Alice.

the best flyer out there.'

21:47.667 --> 21:49.166

You worried?

21:54.500 --> 21:55.792
Fine.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.166
Prepare to get spanked.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.333
You ready, Lewis?

22:03.834 --> 22:05.167
I'll be your base, Marti.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.084
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:07.084 --> 25:08.583

signal for the judges

25:08.583 --> 25:11.000
not to see the captain out
there leading her team.

would this send?

would do for morale?

explaining those reasons

I explain bowing out?

and create all that friction?

the entire squad's future

can see you fly?

would never let that happen.
