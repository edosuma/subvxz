WEBVTT

00:35.481 --> 00:36.585
Hurry up
with the water.

00:36.655 --> 00:38.448
I'm steaming inside
my own shell, I am.

00:38.517 --> 00:39.551
It's that hot, it is.

00:47.723 --> 00:48.862
Man, it's hot.

00:48.930 --> 00:50.689
How hot is it?

00:50.758 --> 00:52.723
It's so hot, I poured
McDonald's coffee

00:52.792 --> 00:53.930
in my lap to cool off.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.274
[ chuckling]

00:55.344 --> 00:57.103
Johnny Carson said it.

00:57.171 --> 00:58.930
[ panting]

00:59.000 --> 01:00.310
No, Nibbler!

01:00.378 --> 01:01.896
Don't drink
the pool water.

01:01.965 --> 01:03.206
It's full
of chlorine.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.275
Ah.

01:07.343 --> 01:08.481
[ belching]

01:08.551 --> 01:11.551
[ coughing]

01:13.620 --> 01:14.551
[ laughing]

01:14.620 --> 01:15.930
Lightweights.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.310
Oh, wait, chlorine.

01:26.379 --> 01:27.481
Perhaps this movie

01:27.551 --> 01:29.965
will help take our minds
off the heat.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.000
Focus.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.655
[ sobbing]

01:47.723 --> 01:49.688
[ chuckling]

01:49.758 --> 01:51.343
You're probably
wondering

01:51.412 --> 01:53.378
why your ice cream
went away.

01:53.448 --> 01:56.206
Well, Susie,
the culprit isn't foreigners.

01:56.275 --> 01:58.412
It's global warming.

01:58.481 --> 02:00.412
Gwobu wabu?

02:00.481 --> 02:01.965
Y-yeah.

02:03.343 --> 02:05.551
Meet Mr. Sunbeam.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.171
He comes all the way
from the sun to visit Earth.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.550
Hello, Earth.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.931
Just popping in
to brighten your day.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.688
La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la.

02:14.758 --> 02:17.068
And now,
I'll be on my way.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.137
Not so fast,
Sunbeam.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.000
We're greenhouse gases.

02:21.068 --> 02:23.205
You ain't going nowhere.

02:23.275 --> 02:25.240
[ grunting]

02:28.068 --> 02:29.826
Oh, God, it hurts.

02:29.896 --> 02:32.861
Pretty soon, Earth
is chockfull of sunbeams

02:32.930 --> 02:35.896
their rotting corpses
heating our atmosphere.

02:35.965 --> 02:38.103
[ laughing]

02:38.171 --> 02:41.516
How do we get wid
of the gweenhouse gwases?

02:41.586 --> 02:44.033
Fortunately, our
handsomest politicians

02:44.103 --> 02:46.448
came up with a cheap,
last-minute way

02:46.516 --> 02:48.067
to combat
global warming.

02:48.137 --> 02:52.033
Ever since 2063, we simply
drop a giant ice cube

02:52.103 --> 02:55.000
into the ocean
every now and then.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.965
Just like Daddy puts
in his dwink every morning.

03:00.033 --> 03:02.275
And then he gets mad.

03:02.343 --> 03:05.895
Of course, since the greenhouse gases are still building up

03:05.965 --> 03:09.137
it takes more and more ice
each time.

03:11.068 --> 03:12.688
Thus, solving the problem
once and for all.

03:12.758 --> 03:13.688
But...

03:13.758 --> 03:14.758
Once and for all!

03:17.723 --> 03:20.620
Well, we just need one
of those big ice cubes.

03:20.688 --> 03:23.103
Someone should call the losers
who were supposed to deliver it.

03:23.171 --> 03:24.103
[ phone ringing]

03:24.171 --> 03:25.103
Hello?

03:25.171 --> 03:26.586
President Nixon here.

03:28.137 --> 03:30.586
I'm hiring you losers
to deliver the ice.

03:30.655 --> 03:31.758
And hurry up.

03:31.826 --> 03:33.896
I'm sweating
like J. Edgar Hoover

03:33.965 --> 03:36.171
trying to squeeze
into a new girdle.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.275
You heard the good news,
everyone.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.826
Save the Earth,
et cetera, et cetera.

03:40.896 --> 03:42.067
Bye.

03:42.137 --> 03:44.137
Wait, where do we get the ice?

03:44.206 --> 03:45.206
The whuh?

03:45.275 --> 03:47.620
Oh, Halley's Comet, of course.

03:47.688 --> 03:50.000
The only sufficient
source of ice cubes

03:50.067 --> 03:51.896
that don't have bugs in them.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.516
Wow, mining a comet.

03:53.586 --> 03:54.826
That sounds fun.

03:54.896 --> 03:58.171
Yes, there's no safer occupation
than mining.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.793
Especially when
you're perched on a snowball

04:00.861 --> 04:03.793
whipping through space
at a million miles an hour.

04:03.861 --> 04:07.550
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.068
Safe.

04:29.862 --> 04:31.723
Deploying ice drill.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.862
Wow, that ice dispenser's
so big, the ice crushes you.

04:42.930 --> 04:44.033
[ chuckling]

04:44.103 --> 04:45.826
Yakov Smirnoff said it.

04:45.896 --> 04:46.930
No he didn't.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Activating ice drill.

04:58.723 --> 05:00.310
FRY:
Oh, my God.

05:00.379 --> 05:02.172
It's out of ice.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.447
Like some outer space Motel 6.

05:04.516 --> 05:05.447
[ gasping]

05:05.516 --> 05:06.482
Completely out of ice?

05:06.550 --> 05:07.862
This could mean

05:07.930 --> 05:11.137
the end of the banana daiquiri
as we know it.

05:12.723 --> 05:14.379
Also life.

05:20.206 --> 05:22.862
[ heavy breathing]

05:22.930 --> 05:24.516
With Halley's Comet
out of ice

05:24.586 --> 05:27.103
Earth is experiencing
the devastating effects

05:27.172 --> 05:29.826
of sudden, intense
global warming.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.413
Morbo is pleased
but sticky.

05:32.481 --> 05:35.862
The scorching heat has melted
the polar ice caps

05:35.930 --> 05:38.862
causing floods
of Biblical proportion.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.343
They called me crazy
for building this ark.

05:41.413 --> 05:42.516
You arecrazy.

05:42.586 --> 05:45.274
You filled it with
same-sex animal couples.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.550
Hey, there are parts
of the Bible I like

05:47.620 --> 05:49.379
and parts I don't like.

05:49.447 --> 05:52.586
MORBO:
Direct your pity now
to the African turtles

05:52.654 --> 05:56.620
seen here migrating
to cooler homes in Holland.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.620
[ sniffling]

05:57.689 --> 05:59.930
That poor turtle.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.930
[ sobbing]

06:02.000 --> 06:04.379
Bender, are you
crying?

06:04.447 --> 06:06.379
Uh, no, never.

06:08.757 --> 06:12.067
Morbo wishes
these stalwart nomads

06:12.137 --> 06:14.274
peace amongst the Dutch tulips.

06:14.343 --> 06:16.757
I'm sure those windmills
will keep them cool.

06:16.826 --> 06:18.516
Windmills do not
work that way!

06:18.586 --> 06:19.586
Good night!

06:24.964 --> 06:27.793
Well, everybody,
I just saved a turtle.

06:27.862 --> 06:29.516
What have you done
with your lives?

06:29.586 --> 06:31.413
You went all the way
to Holland already?

06:33.103 --> 06:34.620
[ clomping]

06:34.689 --> 06:36.481
Bender, a turtle
isn't yourself.

06:36.550 --> 06:38.033
Why do you
care about it?

06:38.103 --> 06:40.516
Because, I also care deeply
about things

06:40.586 --> 06:42.172
that remind me of myself.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.586
Like poor little Shelly here.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.550
[ sobs]

06:46.620 --> 06:48.379
What could you possibly
have in common

06:48.447 --> 06:49.826
with this
walking soup mix?

06:49.896 --> 06:52.654
For one thing, we both
have a tough outer shell.

06:53.689 --> 06:56.067
But lead a rich inner life.

06:56.137 --> 06:58.757
And also... well, you know.

06:58.826 --> 07:00.172
You're both alcoholic

07:00.240 --> 07:02.586
whoremongering
chain-smoking gamblers?

07:02.654 --> 07:04.826
No, it's just...

07:04.896 --> 07:08.586
neither of us can get up
when we get knocked on our back.

07:08.654 --> 07:10.067
What?

07:10.137 --> 07:11.862
I've seen you get up
off your back tons of times.

07:11.930 --> 07:14.274
Those times
I was slightly on my side.

07:14.343 --> 07:15.310
Interesting.

07:15.379 --> 07:16.516
Maybe we should test

07:16.586 --> 07:18.862
this erectile dysfunction
of yours, Bender.

07:18.930 --> 07:21.343
Uh, no, that's
not necessary, really.

07:21.413 --> 07:23.930
I think I hear
my factory recalling me.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.172
[ shouting]

07:25.240 --> 07:27.826
[ struggling]

07:27.896 --> 07:29.413
Oh, that's what I get

07:29.481 --> 07:32.172
for sharing my
vulnerability with you.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.172
Calling all scientists,
calling all scientists.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.240
Be advised, there will be
a worldwide conference

07:38.310 --> 07:40.343
on global warming
in Kyoto, Japan.

07:40.413 --> 07:42.550
I've got a degree
in homeopathic medicine.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.379
You've got
a degree in baloney.

07:45.862 --> 07:48.550
Professor Farnsworth,
you're a scientist.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.413
Forget it.
I'm not going.

07:50.481 --> 07:51.689
I have my reasons.

07:51.757 --> 07:53.103
Shut up, all of you!

07:53.172 --> 07:54.862
Strange.

07:54.930 --> 07:56.757
You haven't acted
this suspicious

07:56.826 --> 07:59.379
since I found those
"ape" bones in the basement.

07:59.447 --> 08:00.689
My hip hurts.

08:00.757 --> 08:02.516
I'm in the middle
of cooking a turkey.

08:02.586 --> 08:04.757
I have warranty cards
to fill out.

08:04.826 --> 08:07.033
I am not just making excuses.

08:07.103 --> 08:09.067
All right, I'll go!

08:17.206 --> 08:19.103
[ crowd cheering]

08:21.413 --> 08:23.757
[ screaming]

08:26.620 --> 08:28.654
Oh, oh, oh, it's
Professor Hubert Farnsworth.

08:28.723 --> 08:32.344
He's looking sharp in a standard
white lab coat and dark slacks.

08:32.413 --> 08:34.481
His wristwatch is a Casio.

08:37.033 --> 08:38.344
Thank you all for coming.

08:38.413 --> 08:40.344
It is my pleasure
to introduce the host

08:40.413 --> 08:42.344
of the Kyoto
global warming convention.

08:42.413 --> 08:45.654
The inventor of the environment,
and first Emperor of the Moon

08:45.724 --> 08:48.586
Al Gore.

08:48.654 --> 08:51.481
I have ridden
the mighty Moon worm.

08:51.551 --> 08:53.931
[ cheering]

08:54.000 --> 08:55.102
Good for him.

08:55.172 --> 08:56.965
My fellow Earthicans

08:57.033 --> 08:59.724
as I discuss in my book,
Earth in the Balance

08:59.793 --> 09:01.586
and the much more popular

09:01.654 --> 09:03.931
Harry Patter
and the Balance of Earth

09:04.000 --> 09:06.931
we need to defend our planet
against pollution

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
as well as dark wizards.

09:11.136 --> 09:13.826
Sure, blame the wizards.

09:13.895 --> 09:17.000
That's why I'm offering
a bag of Moon sapphires

09:17.067 --> 09:19.861
to the first scientist
who can solve this problem

09:19.931 --> 09:21.000
once and for all.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.965
[ oohing]

09:23.033 --> 09:24.102
Lovely, aren't they?

09:24.172 --> 09:25.447
Sapphires?

09:25.517 --> 09:27.033
[ maniacal laughing]

09:27.102 --> 09:30.136
With those I could open
the Gate of Garesh.

09:30.206 --> 09:33.136
First up
is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.620
[ applauding]

09:34.688 --> 09:35.895
Wernstrom!

09:37.344 --> 09:38.413
[ clearing throat]

09:38.481 --> 09:40.102
Ladies and gentlemen

09:40.172 --> 09:42.793
I have placed in orbit
a giant mirror

09:42.861 --> 09:45.551
that will reflect
40% of the sun's rays

09:45.620 --> 09:47.206
thus cooling Earth.

09:47.274 --> 09:48.206
Observe.

09:51.826 --> 09:53.481
[ panting]

09:57.033 --> 09:58.413
[ sighing]

09:58.481 --> 10:00.413
Problem solved.

10:00.481 --> 10:03.136
[ chuckling]

10:03.206 --> 10:05.206
[ laughing continues]

10:05.274 --> 10:06.861
[ clinking]

10:11.000 --> 10:12.379
[ gasping]

10:15.931 --> 10:16.861
Whoa.

10:16.931 --> 10:18.102
That's a little bright.

10:22.172 --> 10:24.620
[ screaming]

10:26.136 --> 10:27.826
[ screaming]

10:29.551 --> 10:31.447
GORE:
All right...

10:31.517 --> 10:32.758
what else we got?

10:32.826 --> 10:34.102
Professor, you're
a professor.

10:34.172 --> 10:35.861
You must have
some ideas.

10:35.931 --> 10:37.102
Absolutely not.

10:37.172 --> 10:38.274
I won't speak.

10:38.344 --> 10:40.379
I've got nothing to hide!

10:40.447 --> 10:42.344
Our next speaker is Professor...

10:42.413 --> 10:44.206
I demand the floor!

10:44.274 --> 10:46.102
Yes, it's your turnto speak.

10:46.172 --> 10:47.688
Well, nuts to me.

10:47.758 --> 10:49.136
I'm taking
the stage.

10:49.206 --> 10:51.620
[ grunting]

10:51.688 --> 10:54.861
I know the source
of the greenhouse gases.

10:54.931 --> 11:00.240
But in my shame, I've kept
it secret for 75 long years.

11:00.309 --> 11:04.240
Oh, it haunts my memories still.

11:05.895 --> 11:07.344
Professor, no! Don't do it!

11:07.413 --> 11:08.379
Don't do what?

11:08.447 --> 11:10.000
Don't use this memory ray

11:10.067 --> 11:12.586
so I can remember
what happened back then?

11:13.965 --> 11:16.895
It was October 17th at 1:54 p.m.

11:16.965 --> 11:20.136
and 14 birds
were flying by the window.

11:20.206 --> 11:23.654
I was working at
Mom's Friendly Robot Company.

11:23.724 --> 11:27.517
Back then, you see,  robots were slow-moving, stiff

11:27.586 --> 11:29.654
and a little
on the uptight side.

11:29.724 --> 11:31.102
Oh, dear.

11:31.172 --> 11:34.688
Might I favor Master with a
tender kiss on the forehead?

11:34.758 --> 11:37.793
Oh, I failed again.

11:37.861 --> 11:38.861
[ beeping]

11:39.654 --> 11:40.724
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

11:40.793 --> 11:42.000
Oh, dear.

11:43.586 --> 11:46.136
PROFESSOR:
The owner of the company
pressured me

11:46.206 --> 11:48.136
