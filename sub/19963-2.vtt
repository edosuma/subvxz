We have much to celebrate
during this year's Goodwill
Gopher Grab.

00:48.330 --> 00:51.330
Not only is this
the 500th anniversary,

00:51.370 --> 00:53.300
but we commemorate this,

00:53.340 --> 00:56.200
Princess Rapunzel's
very first festival.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.040
(applauding and cheering)

01:00.240 --> 01:02.180
To mark this joyous event,

01:02.210 --> 01:07.380
our princess has redesigned
the Gopher Grab seal
of goodwill.

01:07.420 --> 01:10.250
(applauding and cheering)

01:10.290 --> 01:12.350
Ladies and gentlemen of Corona,

01:12.390 --> 01:14.190
Princess Rapunzel.

01:14.220 --> 01:17.130
-(crowd cheering and applauding)
-(laughs) Thank you so much.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.360
Aw! You're all too kind.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.000
Man (with gravelly voice): Boo!

01:23.030 --> 01:26.270
And a boo to you too, sir!

01:30.110 --> 01:31.310
I gotta hand it to you, blondie,

01:31.340 --> 01:32.470
the people of Corona love you.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.510
You're the best!

01:33.540 --> 01:36.340
They sure do know
how to make a girl feel special.

01:36.380 --> 01:39.410
I mean, I've never heard
so much applause,

01:39.450 --> 01:42.050
and someone actually booed me.

01:42.090 --> 01:44.220
Forget that guy.
I wouldn't pay
too much attention--

01:44.250 --> 01:46.250
I've never even heard
that cheer before.

01:46.290 --> 01:49.060
-It's so exotic.
-Huh?

01:49.090 --> 01:51.060
Do you think
he's from overseas?

01:51.090 --> 01:53.390
You don't know
what boo means, do you?

01:53.430 --> 01:55.160
Yeah, I do.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.230
It's a cheer.

01:56.270 --> 02:01.140
Like, "yippie," "hooray,"
"boo," right?

02:01.170 --> 02:03.300
-Uh...
-Rapunzel: No?

02:03.340 --> 02:06.140
All right, so what does it mean?

02:06.180 --> 02:07.340
It means someone hates you.

02:09.350 --> 02:11.350
Way to candy-coat it,
Cassandra.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.310
Why wouldn't someone like me?

02:13.350 --> 02:16.250
What could I have done
to this person?

02:16.290 --> 02:18.050
Rapunzel, who cares?

02:18.090 --> 02:20.160
Not everyone has to like you.
That's part of life.

02:20.190 --> 02:24.160
Eugene's right.
Someone could not like you
for any number of reasons.

02:24.190 --> 02:27.430
For instance,
maybe you have a stupid goatee
that makes you look ridiculous,

02:27.460 --> 02:30.000
and someone might
not like you for that.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.330
You know, Cassandra,

02:31.370 --> 02:34.000
it's a little hard
to take your insults seriously

02:34.040 --> 02:35.140
when you're holding that thing.

02:35.170 --> 02:37.270
(grunting)

02:38.340 --> 02:40.440
This thing is important.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.350
Gregorio the Goodwill Gopher
represents half a millennium
of honor and tradition

02:45.380 --> 02:47.080
throughout this kingdom.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.120
(grunts)

02:49.150 --> 02:51.250
We're still talking
about the rat, right?

02:51.290 --> 02:52.520
Gopher!

02:52.560 --> 02:56.120
For your information,
the Gopher Grab is
a Corona institution.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.230
I was entrusted
as the mascot's caretaker

02:58.260 --> 03:02.200
because it is a mark
of hallowed esteem.

03:02.230 --> 03:03.360
-Yeah, that's special.
-(grunts)

03:03.400 --> 03:04.370
(grunting)

03:04.400 --> 03:06.400
-He just pooped on you.
-(gasps)

03:06.440 --> 03:08.100
-Listen, blondie...
-Ugh!

03:08.140 --> 03:09.970
...you're just gonna have
to accept the fact

03:10.010 --> 03:11.370
that some people
aren't gonna like you.

03:11.410 --> 03:18.080
Ugh! All I can hear
is his gravelly, "Boo,"
over and over in my head.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.150
Rapunzel, I know
your feelings are hurt.
I get that.

03:21.180 --> 03:22.320
But, hey, you gotta admit,

03:22.350 --> 03:25.250
if Cassandra and I are
actually agreeing on something,

03:25.290 --> 03:27.160
it's probably
worth listening to.

03:27.190 --> 03:28.190
Let this one go.

03:28.230 --> 03:30.990
(sighs)
You know what?

03:31.030 --> 03:32.160
You're right.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.000
Thank you.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.200
Yeah, no, she's not.

03:37.230 --> 03:40.200
Nope, not letting it go.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.140
You know, Pascal, maybe Eugene
and Cassandra were right.

03:44.170 --> 03:46.240
I shouldn't let
this booer bother me.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.310
It's not the end of the world
because I got booed, right?

03:49.350 --> 03:51.450
Happens to a lot of people,
I'm sure.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.250
You know what?
I'm not even gonna think
about the word "boo" anymore.

03:55.290 --> 03:58.450
Let's just sit
and enjoy our afternoon.

03:58.490 --> 04:01.020
♪ Ba-ba-boo
Ba-ba-boo ♪

04:01.060 --> 04:03.020
Hey, check out
my new taboo!

04:03.060 --> 04:05.060
Boo repair!
Get your boos repaired.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.230
All:
Boo! Boo!
Boo. Boo. Boo.

04:08.270 --> 04:09.330
Ugh!

04:09.370 --> 04:12.370
Man (with gravelly voice):
No, thank you!

04:12.400 --> 04:15.140
Wow! Thank you.
Thank you indeed.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.340
My pleasure, son.

04:16.370 --> 04:18.170
Spread the goodwill.

04:18.210 --> 04:22.440
The sweet, little, old man
can't be the same person
who booed me, can he?

04:22.480 --> 04:26.450
Boo!

04:26.480 --> 04:28.250
(gasping)

04:30.800 --> 04:34.010
Okay, I'd saHBike our booer,
wouldn't you, Pascal?

04:35.940 --> 04:37.080
(croaks)

04:37.110 --> 04:40.040
Now, we just need
to figure out who he is.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.150
Someone has to know him, right?

04:42.180 --> 04:44.050
-(door opening)
-Hey, it's Monty!

04:44.080 --> 04:46.080
(gasps)
Wait! You know him?

04:46.120 --> 04:49.020
Of course I...
Everyone knows Monty.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.790
Well, probably because
he's really grouchy

04:51.830 --> 04:53.190
and doesn't like anyone, right?

04:53.230 --> 04:56.890
What? Uncle Monty,
he's the sweetest guy
in all Corona.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.160
Let me tell you.
If there were someone
he didn't like,

04:59.200 --> 05:02.130
that person would have to be
the most horrible...

05:02.170 --> 05:03.940
Oh, my goodness!

05:03.970 --> 05:06.040
That's the guy
who booed you, isn't it?

05:06.070 --> 05:07.070
Yes.

05:07.110 --> 05:09.970
(stammering) Wait.
Wait a minute. No.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.740
Uh, now that
I'm looking at it...

05:12.780 --> 05:14.950
'Cause I'm really looking
at it now. (chuckling)
Before I glanced at it.

05:14.980 --> 05:16.080
That is not Monty.

05:16.120 --> 05:21.050
No, that is... Rude Guy... er.

05:21.090 --> 05:22.050
Rude Guyer!

05:22.090 --> 05:23.920
Yeah. Oh, boy!

05:23.960 --> 05:25.920
Nobody likes Rude Guyer.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.760
'Cause he's such a rude guy.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.100
Hey, look at that!
Uncle Monty!

05:32.130 --> 05:33.770
Oh, hi, Eugene.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.770
That's some painting
of Uncle Monty, huh?

05:35.800 --> 05:37.040
It is Monty.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.770
I'll say.

05:38.810 --> 05:40.940
You know, you don't forget
the guy who introduced you
to your wife.

05:40.970 --> 05:43.810
And everyone likes him?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.140
No, no, of course not.
Don't be silly.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.150
Eugene's right.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.050
Everyone loves him.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.750
Uh, do you know
where I could find him?

05:51.790 --> 05:53.950
Monty is a very private person.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.020
Sure, Your Majesty.

05:55.060 --> 05:57.090
He has a wonderful
little shop in town.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.860
Here, let me draw you a map.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.930
Thank you, Stan.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.070
(sarcastically)
Yeah, thanks so much, Stan.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.100
It's no problem.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.770
And when you see him,

06:10.800 --> 06:14.710
tell him thanks
for the flowers he sent
to my mom when she was sick.

06:14.740 --> 06:16.770
So, listen, Rapunzel--

06:16.810 --> 06:19.880
I know. I know.
You're gonna tell me
to leave it alone,

06:19.910 --> 06:22.910
but this is all
just a simple misunderstanding.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.150
I need to clear things up

06:24.180 --> 06:26.950
so me and Uncle Monty
can be friends.

06:26.990 --> 06:28.120
(sighing)

06:28.150 --> 06:31.120
Cassandra:
Ugh! These berry stains
are impossible.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.760
I just don't get it, Cass.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.030
Why can't Rapunzel let it go?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.930
Okay, so one person
doesn't like her. Who cares?

06:36.960 --> 06:40.770
I know! I mean,
only one person does like you,
and you're okay with that.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.930
Exactly--
Oh, I see what you did there.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.840
I gotta get
some lotion for his paws.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.000
Can you watch him
for a few minutes?

06:46.040 --> 06:47.710
Oh, are you sure
I can be trusted

06:47.740 --> 06:49.840
with this hallowed
Corona institution?

06:49.880 --> 06:51.710
I was talking
to the gopher.

06:51.750 --> 06:52.710
(grunts)

06:56.050 --> 06:58.180
Mmm. (gulping)

06:58.220 --> 06:59.780
Hmm? Mmm.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.020
(grunting)

07:01.050 --> 07:03.120
Oh, yeah.
I see why you like these.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.120
Wanna go halfsies?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.890
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.700
Okay, Monty can't be as great
as everyone says, Pascal.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.900
I mean, this here says
that he owns a sweat shop.

07:17.940 --> 07:19.140
(croaks)

07:20.810 --> 07:22.870
(children laughing)

07:24.140 --> 07:25.740
Sweet shop.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.810
Yeah, okay, way to spell, Stan.

07:45.170 --> 07:47.770
Children:
Oooh!

07:47.800 --> 07:49.800
There you go, dear.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.170
May you spread
the spirit of goodwill
throughout Corona.

07:53.210 --> 07:54.870
Pardon me.

07:54.910 --> 07:56.810
And you, sweetie,

07:56.840 --> 07:57.980
how can I help--

07:58.010 --> 07:59.010
You!

07:59.050 --> 08:01.910
Hi, uh, Monty.

08:01.950 --> 08:03.110
Can I call you Monty?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.720
Apparently.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.920
(laughs awkwardly)

08:05.950 --> 08:08.990
So, I see
you're a Gopher Grab fan.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.820
Figured that our
all by yourself, huh?

08:11.860 --> 08:14.690
Well, give the girl a lolly.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.900
Monty:
Ha! That one fell on the floor.

08:19.070 --> 08:20.130
(croaking)

08:20.170 --> 08:23.730
Um, Monty,
how do I put this?

08:23.770 --> 08:25.840
Um, during my speech,

08:25.870 --> 08:27.040
somebody booed me,

08:27.070 --> 08:29.840
and I was wondering--

08:29.880 --> 08:31.840
And what are
you gonna do, huh? Huh?

08:31.880 --> 08:34.850
You gonna throw me
in the dungeon
cause I booed you, huh?

08:34.880 --> 08:36.850
Is that why you're here?
To oppress me?

08:36.880 --> 08:40.080
No! No! I don't want
to oppress anyone.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.720
I just wanna know what I did.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.720
Listen, Your Highness,

08:44.760 --> 08:46.990
I don't need
to explain myself to you.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.860
Wait, Princess.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.870
(croaks)

08:55.030 --> 08:57.070
That lollipop
wasn't free, you know.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.670
I am not giving up
that easy, Pascal.

09:00.710 --> 09:02.910
If he can't see
what a likable person I am,

09:02.940 --> 09:05.010
well, I will make him see.

09:06.950 --> 09:08.050
Rapunzel:
<i> Here's what we know so far.</i>

09:08.080 --> 09:10.820
Monty has a candy shop,
everyone loves him,

09:10.850 --> 09:12.850
and he likes yelling
mean things at me.

09:12.890 --> 09:15.820
Time for Operation Make Stuff.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.690
(croaking)

09:21.900 --> 09:23.790
(twittering)

09:26.100 --> 09:29.700
Oh! Look at this!
Now, this is flashy!

09:29.740 --> 09:30.800
I hate flashy.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.000
Also, I hate green.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.080
(bell ringing)

09:48.720 --> 09:50.920
Ah, just as I thought.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.920
Hollow.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.830
In my day,
chocolate sculptures were solid,

09:54.860 --> 09:55.930
like our values.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.130
(bell ringing)

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
Oh!

10:04.200 --> 10:08.770
Wow! Much better than the one
my great-grandfather painted,

10:08.810 --> 10:11.140
when he built this shop
with his own two hands!

10:17.180 --> 10:18.150
(groaning)

10:19.950 --> 10:21.050
(muffled)
He hates me.

10:21.090 --> 10:22.950
Okay. Come on, Raps.
Give it up.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.960
Clearly, this jerk's got
serious problems.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.190
But if Monty could just see
that I was---

10:27.230 --> 10:29.760
Monty is the guy
who hates you?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.760
(scoffs) Let me guess.
You love him.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.000
No! Me? Love him? No.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.100
I hate that guy.
(chuckles)

10:39.140 --> 10:42.810
Look, you'll just have
to accept that Uncle Monty--

10:42.840 --> 10:44.180
Monty doesn't like you,

10:44.210 --> 10:46.880
and there's nothing
you can do to change it.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.110
You're right.

10:48.150 --> 10:51.880
There is nothing...
(emphatically) I can do.

10:53.950 --> 10:55.120
Can I help you, young lady?

10:56.160 --> 10:57.790
Good afternoon, sir.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.920
Rapunzel:
Whoa!

10:59.960 --> 11:01.890
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

11:01.930 --> 11:04.900
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm fine.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.130
Monty:
I got that thing as a gift,

11:06.170 --> 11:07.930
and I'm trying to find
some use for it.

11:07.970 --> 11:10.770
Let me tell you, it's not
even useful as a doorstop.

11:10.800 --> 11:14.840
Yeah, dumb
and totally useless thing.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.740
(scoffs)

11:16.780 --> 11:19.110
I sure hope the foolish
but clearly well-intentioned

11:19.150 --> 11:21.810
person who made it regrets it,

11:21.850 --> 11:25.920
even though it probably took
her... or him... who knows?

11:25.950 --> 11:29.020
...hours to...
(clears throat)
...get it just right.

11:29.060 --> 11:30.150
Yes, right.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.960
Well, what can
I get for you, Miss, uhm...

11:32.990 --> 11:36.160
Uh, Miss... Missy.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.730
Misty. Miss Misty.

11:38.770 --> 11:41.170
And I will have some jellybeans.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.840
Every kind but green,
because I... I hate green.

11:44.870 --> 11:48.010
(laughs)
A girl after my own heart.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.770
I'll tell you what.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.980
I've got a personal stash
where I already picked out
all the green ones.

11:53.010 --> 11:54.780
Let me get them.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.750
(grunts)

11:57.780 --> 11:59.750
(gasps)
Two hours to the big race.

11:59.790 --> 12:00.750
Chow o'clock.

12:02.190 --> 12:06.160
Eugene, did you eat
all the bimberries?

12:06.190 --> 12:08.960
No! No, of course not.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.130
Okay, so I ate some.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.830
I offered to split.

12:13.870 --> 12:15.870
Is that really
such a big problem?

12:15.900 --> 12:18.770
(laughing wryly)
Okay, well, let's think.

12:18.810 --> 12:22.070
If Gregorio doesn't get
his bimberries before the race,
he'll be lethargic,

12:22.110 --> 12:23.940
and if he's lethargic,
he won't want to run,

12:23.980 --> 12:26.710
and if he doesn't want to run,
the Gopher Grab will be ruined,

12:26.750 --> 12:28.780
and I can't have that!

12:28.820 --> 12:31.180
So I'm gonna go
with big problem?

12:31.220 --> 12:35.750
Find me some bimberries... now.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.190
Monty:
And I'm telling you,

12:38.220 --> 12:41.760
my great-granddad would have won
the Gopher Grab that year,

12:41.790 --> 12:44.830
but he was running
the wrong way! (laughing)

12:44.860 --> 12:47.930
(laughing)

12:49.100 --> 12:51.170
That Grab means
a lot to you, huh?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.170
You know, Misty,
I've never told this to anyone,

12:53.210 --> 12:55.040
but I feel like I can trust you.

12:55.070 --> 12:58.110
I come from a long line
of Gopher Grab champions.

12:58.140 --> 13:01.010
Oh, they used to say
that our family had
the gift for grab,

13:01.050 --> 13:04.150
and it was my dream
to carry on our
family tradition.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.020
But no matter how hard I tried,

13:08.050 --> 13:11.790
that little rascal
always managed to slip
through my fingers.

13:11.820 --> 13:14.160
And while I've never
admitted this out loud before,

13:14.190 --> 13:16.730
sometimes, deep down,

13:16.760 --> 13:18.730
I can't help but feel ashamed.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.970
But that's enough
of the weepies.

13:26.010 --> 13:27.040
Hey, I know.

13:27.070 --> 13:29.170
I've got just the thing
to cheer us up.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.980
Yes! Right
in the royal kisser!

13:35.010 --> 13:36.810
(laughing)

13:38.180 --> 13:40.920
Rapunzel (laughs)
Wow.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.720
You really don't like
the princess.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.920
Well, I wouldn't say
I don't like her.

13:45.960 --> 13:48.730
But I would say
I can't stand her.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.030
(exasperatedly)
Why?

13:50.060 --> 13:51.760
I mean, why?

13:51.800 --> 13:53.860
You wanna know
why I don't like her?

13:53.900 --> 13:56.070
I don't like the princess
because--

13:56.100 --> 13:59.040
-(bells tolling)
-(gasps) It's Gopher Grab time!

13:59.070 --> 14:01.070
Come on, Misty. Let's go!

14:01.110 --> 14:03.940
Uh... Sure you don't wanna
finish that sentence?

14:05.780 --> 14:07.980
You know, we could watch
the Gopher Grab,

14:08.010 --> 14:10.680
but it's also
not too late to sign up.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.950
Wait. You mean
you want me to compete?

14:12.990 --> 14:14.990
Ah, trust me, Monty.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.890
Sometimes, you just gotta say
the heck with it!

14:17.920 --> 14:19.020
Maybe.

14:19.060 --> 14:20.160
But I couldn't. No.

14:20.190 --> 14:22.160
I mean, I don't
even have a partner.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.860
Well, guess what.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.160
You do now.

14:28.570 --> 14:31.640
(trumpets playing fanfare)HB

14:33.870 --> 14:35.840
Did someone ask
for dimberries?

14:35.880 --> 14:38.580
You sure took your own
sweet time getting them.

14:38.610 --> 14:41.610
Don't you realize
the Gopher Grab is
about to start any minute now?

14:41.650 --> 14:44.450
(sighs)
I hope these
aren't store-bought.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.950
Well, you know,
for someone careless enough

14:45.990 --> 14:48.650
to leave poor Gregorio alone
with somebody who would eat
all of his berries,

14:48.690 --> 14:50.450
you're being really particular.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.560
Okay, Gregorio, time to eat.

14:52.590 --> 14:56.630
(grunting)

14:59.430 --> 15:00.970
Oh, boy!
This could take a minute.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.700
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is nearly time
for this year's Gopher Grab!

15:05.740 --> 15:07.770
Hey, hey, don't worry.
I'll handle it.

15:10.610 --> 15:11.810
(grunts excitedly)

15:15.450 --> 15:17.620
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.390
I know we're all anxious
to see Gregorio the gopher
do his thing.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.720
I know I am.
(laughs)

15:22.760 --> 15:24.460
But before we get started,

15:24.490 --> 15:28.390
I'd like to say a few words
about the true meaning
of goodwill.

15:28.430 --> 15:31.400
(crowd muttering disapprovingly)

15:31.430 --> 15:35.400
Cassandra: (sighs)
Okay, Gregorio, time
to, um, get ready.

15:35.430 --> 15:39.500
Wow. (laughing)
You are a little hungry guy,
aren't you?

15:41.440 --> 15:44.610
I mean, you gotta ask yourself,
"Am I spreading goodwill,

15:44.640 --> 15:47.650
or am I spreading good won't?"

15:47.680 --> 15:49.050
(crowd cheering and applauding)

15:49.080 --> 15:51.420
So, in conclusion,
spread goodwill.
Thank you for your time. Bye.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.520
-(trumpets playing fanfare)
-(crowd applauding and cheering)

15:59.790 --> 16:01.360
(music box playing)

16:03.400 --> 16:05.800
(clinking)

16:08.870 --> 16:09.830
(whistle trilling)

16:12.810 --> 16:13.840
(crowd murmuring)

16:17.480 --> 16:18.480
What the--

16:18.510 --> 16:20.440
(growling)

16:20.480 --> 16:22.680
(exclaiming)

16:22.720 --> 16:24.450
(growling)

16:29.460 --> 16:31.420
-(crowd exclaiming)
-Man: The gopher's gone mad!

16:31.460 --> 16:32.420
(growling)

16:38.630 --> 16:40.630
(giggles nervously)

16:40.670 --> 16:43.470
Crowd (chanting):
Grab the gopher!
Grab the gopher!

16:45.500 --> 16:47.400
(laughing)

16:47.440 --> 16:48.770
Oh, boy!

16:48.810 --> 16:52.540
You guys really undersold
this whole Gopher Grab thing.

16:52.580 --> 16:53.740
I just don't understand it.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.550
Why would Gregorio react
to bimberries like this?

16:56.580 --> 16:58.580
You mean dimberries?

16:58.620 --> 16:59.650
Dim-what?

16:59.690 --> 17:01.720
No. Bimberries.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.450
-I thought you said--
-Dimberries. No.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.560
-Wait. You mean--
What do you mean?
-You've been talking about...

17:05.590 --> 17:08.630
These were supposed
to be bimberries.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.700
You know, for someone
who was careless enough
to leave...

17:11.730 --> 17:14.830
Don't you know dimberries
cause hyperactivity in rodents?

17:14.870 --> 17:18.370
Uh, yeah. Who doesn't?

17:19.510 --> 17:21.410
(growling)

17:21.440 --> 17:22.810
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.640
(Monty exclaiming)

17:24.680 --> 17:27.680
Rapunzel: (grunting)
Yeah, not so fun.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.450
(growling)

17:34.690 --> 17:36.490
(growling)

17:37.590 --> 17:38.720
Come on, Misty.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.560
Let's show these youngsters
how a gopher is really caught.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.400
Look!
(clears throat) There.

17:53.570 --> 17:54.540
(growling)

18:01.450 --> 18:02.550
-Where did he go?
-Shh.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.520
(panting)

18:06.550 --> 18:09.450
All we gotta do now is hop.

18:09.490 --> 18:12.390
No, no, no, no,
let's take that bridge.

18:12.430 --> 18:13.790
We'll catch him
on the other side.

18:13.830 --> 18:16.460
Sorry, Misty.
I can't take that chance.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.490
I think you were right.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.360
Sometimes, you just gotta say
to heck with it!

18:20.400 --> 18:21.730
Monty!

18:28.570 --> 18:29.710
(exerting)

18:29.740 --> 18:31.440
Whoa!

18:31.480 --> 18:32.540
Whoa!

18:32.580 --> 18:33.580
Monty!

18:34.710 --> 18:36.510
Forget me.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.680
Get that gopher!

18:39.720 --> 18:41.790
No! No, don't forget me!

18:41.820 --> 18:44.390
I was trying to sound brave!

18:44.420 --> 18:45.560
It backfired!

18:45.590 --> 18:48.430
(yelling)
No!

18:48.460 --> 18:50.760
(yelling and exclaiming)

18:50.800 --> 18:53.430
Monty:
No!

18:53.470 --> 18:54.670
(yelling)

19:02.640 --> 19:04.410
(yelling)

19:05.580 --> 19:06.710
(yelling)

19:07.750 --> 19:11.620
(yelling)

19:13.820 --> 19:15.650
Hold on, Monty!

19:15.690 --> 19:17.490
-I got you.
-(cracking)

19:19.630 --> 19:21.460
(screaming)

19:22.600 --> 19:23.560
(yelling)

19:25.500 --> 19:27.830
(yelling)

19:27.870 --> 19:29.370
Oh.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.570
(yelling)

19:31.600 --> 19:34.770
(yelling)

19:36.810 --> 19:38.710
Princess Rapunzel?

19:38.740 --> 19:41.380
(laughs nervously)
Surprise.

19:43.820 --> 19:46.420
Your Majesty,
you went through all of this

19:46.450 --> 19:47.750
just to win my favor?

19:47.790 --> 19:51.390
I know. I know.
It's a little crazy,

19:51.420 --> 19:52.760
but I just had to know
why you booed me.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.490
Fine. You wanna know
why I booed?

19:55.530 --> 19:56.830
(eagerly)
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.400
The seal.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.800
Wait. The Goodwill seal?

20:00.830 --> 20:02.800
Yes, the Goodwill seal.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.600
You redesigned
a perfectly good seal.

20:05.640 --> 20:06.840
(questioningly)
I-I'm sorry.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.610
Since you've returned,
everything's changed.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.640
I mean, come on!

20:11.680 --> 20:13.510
A royal in bare feet?

20:13.550 --> 20:15.550
Pub thugs in the castle?

20:15.580 --> 20:16.680
The list goes on.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.880
It's like you
and your free spirit

20:17.920 --> 20:20.680
have a total disregard
for tradition.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.590
And then I realized that, well,

20:26.630 --> 20:29.860
maybe that spirit
and to-heck-with-it attitude
aren't so bad after all.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.570
I mean, you did inspire me
to achieve my life's dream.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.630
(panting)

20:36.670 --> 20:39.440
See? I told you
that with--

20:39.470 --> 20:43.610
But then, you put on
this deceitful charade
and made a complete fool of me!

20:43.640 --> 20:46.640
Wait. So, are we friends again?

20:46.680 --> 20:47.840
Of course not.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.610
And we never will be.

20:49.650 --> 20:51.750
Because I don't like you.

20:51.780 --> 20:55.450
Not everybody has
to like everyone, Your Majesty.

20:55.490 --> 20:56.520
You know what?

20:56.560 --> 20:58.690
Now that
I'm thinking of it,

20:58.720 --> 21:01.430
I don't think
I like you so much either.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.860
No, no, wait. Wait.
I know I don't like you.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.830
Not friends?

21:08.470 --> 21:09.500
Not friends.

21:16.580 --> 21:17.640
King Frederic:
All right, all right.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.410
As you all know,

21:19.450 --> 21:21.780
the Gopher Grab
is a sacred tradition.

21:22.850 --> 21:24.580
So, Blondie,
you feeling okay

21:24.620 --> 21:26.620
about how you left things
with Monty?

21:26.650 --> 21:27.650
Yeah.

21:27.690 --> 21:29.620
I mean,
you guys were right.

21:29.660 --> 21:33.520
I just had to accept that
not everyone is gonna like me.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.430
And the winner
of this year's Gopher Grab

21:36.460 --> 21:38.430
is good, old Uncle Monty!

21:38.460 --> 21:42.700
(cheering and applauding)

21:42.740 --> 21:44.800
Boo!

21:46.740 --> 21:47.840
What?

21:47.870 --> 21:51.540
Not everybody
has to like everyone,

21:51.580 --> 21:52.580
<i> you know?</i>
