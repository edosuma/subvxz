01:16.676 --> 01:20.669
"GUN-SHY"

03:28.007 --> 03:30.942
Excuse me, Ms. Sieveking?

03:30.977 --> 03:34.970
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:35.782 --> 03:39.617
It's open.

03:39.652 --> 03:43.645
Sorry, I'm late.

03:51.798 --> 03:55.791
I'm not hungry.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.813
You're new here, huh?

04:06.848 --> 04:10.806
Sorry.

04:20.326 --> 04:24.319
Those foreigners
still think I'm sexy.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.758
Put it on the table.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.879
- What's your name?
- Lukas.

04:39.914 --> 04:41.913
Lukas.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.941
If you wanna fuck me, I'll
do it for half price, okay?

04:47.487 --> 04:51.480
Okay.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.715
You know if Ms.
Meffert's there?

05:15.750 --> 05:19.708
How should I know?

05:21.854 --> 05:23.721
Who are you anyway?

05:23.756 --> 05:26.025
I'm doing social service.
I deliver meals.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.394
I see.

05:27.429 --> 05:28.693
Actually.

05:28.728 --> 05:32.721
I haven't seen the old
lady for two or three days.

05:34.567 --> 05:37.835
Yeah, well...
I've got a key.

05:37.870 --> 05:41.863
Maybe she's asleep.
Just leave it here.

05:45.778 --> 05:49.771
Ms. Meffert?

06:20.680 --> 06:22.181
Could you get something to
cut her down with, please?

06:22.216 --> 06:24.549
Quick!

06:24.584 --> 06:28.577
Let her hang there.
She's a goner.

06:40.199 --> 06:43.636
What's in here?

06:43.671 --> 06:47.368
Ms. Meffert's meal.

06:47.403 --> 06:51.066
What's for lunch today?

06:51.544 --> 06:55.537
Mashed potatoes, vegetables
and a beef patty.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.797
Anyway, it seems to
smell strange, I come in,

07:10.832 --> 07:12.816
and the old guy's
shit the bed.

07:12.851 --> 07:14.801
I just left the
food there...

07:14.836 --> 07:16.353
Take care!

07:16.388 --> 07:18.597
Yeah, see you.

07:18.632 --> 07:20.772
- Bye!
- Bye.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.009
- Bye.
- Bye, take care.

07:23.044 --> 07:24.444
Have a nice evening.

07:24.479 --> 07:28.437
Same to you.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.782
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

08:56.235 --> 09:00.228
Bye.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.209
Please, shut the
door tightly.

09:03.244 --> 09:07.202
- I will.
- Thank you.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.913
Hey!

09:24.330 --> 09:28.323
Hey!

09:44.884 --> 09:48.877
HELP ME!

09:54.794 --> 09:57.797
Hey, could you open the door?
Could you open the door?

09:57.832 --> 10:01.065
Sure.

10:01.100 --> 10:05.093
Excuse me!

10:12.912 --> 10:16.905
Do you live around here?

10:24.857 --> 10:28.850
Could I stay at
your place tonight?

10:29.261 --> 10:32.008
Stay over?

10:32.043 --> 10:34.756
Yeah... sure.

10:47.446 --> 10:50.043
What d'you think?

10:50.078 --> 10:52.641
Which one is yours?

10:52.952 --> 10:56.087
I'm sure it's not
the black one.

10:56.122 --> 11:00.115
I sure wish I'd had one of
those when I got started.

11:01.727 --> 11:05.720
Candles are somehow too hard.
Not even creams will help.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.866
Bananas are no good either.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.969
I peeled 'em and
put condoms on 'em.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.274
But they get so mushy in the
condoms from all the friction.

11:15.309 --> 11:19.267
And that's no good either.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.982
Of course, you can
use a cucumber.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.186
If you leave it lying
around for a few days,

11:27.221 --> 11:30.021
it feels like a real cock.

11:30.056 --> 11:34.049
But then it gets all wrinkly
and isn't very erotic anymore.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.464
My mother used to buy big
pieces of beef tenderloin,

11:44.499 --> 11:48.129
and when she wasn't there,
I'd sneak to the fridge...

11:48.374 --> 11:52.367
and take out a piece,
warm it up, punch a hole in it,

12:00.453 --> 12:04.457
and then I'd stick
my cock in it.

12:04.492 --> 12:07.193
That was really nice.

12:07.228 --> 12:09.860
Can I use your shower?

12:09.895 --> 12:13.833
Sure, but I only
have a bathtub.

12:13.868 --> 12:15.434
What about water?

12:15.469 --> 12:17.234
Water?

12:17.269 --> 12:19.236
Sure, I have water.

12:19.271 --> 12:23.264
I'll take a bath then.
Okay?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.741
- Can I use your towel?
- Yeah, sure.

12:41.327 --> 12:45.320
- Is this okay?
- Yeah, sure.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.312
- You got an ashtray?
- An ashtray?

13:00.347 --> 13:04.305
Yeah... somewhere.

13:14.860 --> 13:18.853
Thanks.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.167
Careful!

13:27.202 --> 13:30.031
Sorry.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.312
Sorry.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.483
Do you really wanna fuck me?

14:11.518 --> 14:15.476
No!

14:17.189 --> 14:20.709
That's good.

14:20.744 --> 14:24.195
What's that?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.081
I got scalped once.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.933
Bullshit.
Really?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.334
Yeah.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.504
When I was a kid I went
sledding with my dad.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.575
There was a freight car at
the bottom of the hill...

14:36.610 --> 14:40.568
that everyone rode under.

14:41.046 --> 14:41.946
But not me.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.948
I was chicken,
'cause I was too big.

14:43.983 --> 14:47.976
But my father really wanted
me to do it, so I did.

14:48.087 --> 14:51.188
He always said I
shouldn't be a coward.

14:51.223 --> 14:55.216
The problem was that my head
got caught on a piece of metal,

14:56.095 --> 14:59.498
and they'd to sew on my entire
scalp at the hospital...

14:59.533 --> 15:02.299
...32 stitches.

15:02.334 --> 15:05.035
I don't know if
you've seen this scar.

15:05.070 --> 15:09.063
I was 21/2 and it was the
worst winter of the century,

15:10.042 --> 15:12.378
I wanted to paint
Easter eggs,

15:12.413 --> 15:13.944
and the boiler was broken.

15:13.979 --> 15:17.972
So there was boiling water, and
they had this velour sweater...

15:18.717 --> 15:21.953
It doesn't matter.

15:21.988 --> 15:25.585
In any case, I was...

15:25.620 --> 15:29.183
in the hospital again.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.224
Hey.

16:00.259 --> 16:04.252
Good morning.

16:05.698 --> 16:09.691
Lukas.

16:10.002 --> 16:13.995
Want some coffee?

16:43.035 --> 16:46.770
I have to get off here.

16:46.805 --> 16:49.273
Can I... can I
see you again?

16:49.308 --> 16:51.777
Can I maybe have
your phone number?

16:51.812 --> 16:53.278
I'll only give
it to you once.

16:53.313 --> 16:57.116
0-1-7-1-2-5-8-7-3-5-4

16:57.151 --> 17:01.109
0-1-7-1-2-5-8...

17:17.703 --> 17:21.695
Isabella.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.448
Using someone's hair
to stimulate them...

18:04.483 --> 18:08.476
means you enhance the perception
of the nerves and senses.

18:49.761 --> 18:53.754
He took new shoes and hit me
in the face with the shoes.

18:59.271 --> 19:03.264
Come over here and sit down.

19:06.578 --> 19:09.592
A customer?

19:09.627 --> 19:12.607
Not yet.

19:12.751 --> 19:16.744
And then he broke
off the heels.

19:19.925 --> 19:23.918
He can't stand it that
I'm bigger than he is.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.795
I'm so lucky you're here.

19:28.830 --> 19:32.360
Why don't you open it?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.813
Hungry?
I have pasta with...

19:46.848 --> 19:50.444
No, thanks.
I've already eaten.

19:51.890 --> 19:55.883
Too bad.
I'll have to throw it away.

20:10.742 --> 20:14.735
Thanks.

21:49.574 --> 21:52.309
Put that crap here.

21:52.344 --> 21:56.337
You can find a knife and fork
over there in the drawer.

21:57.015 --> 22:00.984
Underneath it.

22:01.019 --> 22:05.012
Why don't you want
to go to the army?

22:05.824 --> 22:09.817
Well, that's one answer.

22:09.895 --> 22:13.888
I was a sniper.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.535
I don't have a bad
conscience though.

22:16.570 --> 22:20.528
It was wartime.

22:24.509 --> 22:27.544
What kind of crap is this?

22:27.579 --> 22:31.572
Knuckle of veal in gravy,
Bavarian cabbage and potatoes.

22:33.118 --> 22:36.054
Is he allowed to
eat from the plate?

22:36.089 --> 22:38.722
As an exception.

22:38.757 --> 22:42.750
What a hungry dog you are!
What a hungry dog you are!

22:48.633 --> 22:51.970
That's enough, Robbie.
Come on.

22:52.005 --> 22:55.963
Come to Mommy.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.844
My little friend, eh?

23:04.879 --> 23:07.908
My little friend.

23:09.087 --> 23:12.023
- Hi, is Isabella home?
- Yeah.

23:12.058 --> 23:15.505
- Who are you?
- I'm Lukas.

23:15.540 --> 23:18.953
- And you are?
- Jonas.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.398
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.069
Is Isabella home?
I wanted to pick her up.

23:24.104 --> 23:25.569
Isabella?

23:25.604 --> 23:27.105
Yes, I have a
date with her.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.775
I see, a date.

23:29.810 --> 23:32.376
And who are you?

23:32.411 --> 23:35.480
Oh yes, I'm Lukas,
Lukas Eiserbeck.

23:35.515 --> 23:39.473
Hello.

23:43.422 --> 23:47.415
She's upstairs.

23:56.034 --> 23:57.702
Hi, Lukas.
I'm almost ready.

23:57.737 --> 24:01.695
You can wait in my room.

24:39.277 --> 24:42.045
Rorschach test.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.073
- Do you know it?
- No.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.478
You take a piece of paper,
fold it, unfold it again...

24:54.993 --> 24:58.986
And then you drop ink on it.

25:05.136 --> 25:09.129
Then you fold it again.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.212
Then you unfold it,
tell me what you see,

25:14.247 --> 25:18.205
and I tell you who you are.

25:22.621 --> 25:26.614
It looks... like
all the others.

25:27.325 --> 25:31.318
Yes!

25:37.335 --> 25:40.303
Strange, isn't it?

25:40.338 --> 25:41.905
Read this to me.
Come on.

25:41.940 --> 25:45.809
Places, place,
stone, stones...

25:45.844 --> 25:49.837
Stones, brake, brake,
sports, sports, place...

25:49.948 --> 25:51.047
Jonas?

25:51.082 --> 25:53.084
- I'll bring you something.
- Something nice?

25:53.119 --> 25:53.950
Sure.

25:53.985 --> 25:54.951
- Bye!
- Bye!

25:54.986 --> 25:58.979
Sporty, trip,
travel, minute...

26:07.032 --> 26:09.267
Watch out, you'll hit a tree.

26:09.302 --> 26:13.260
Careful, duck!
Yeah.

26:14.005 --> 26:17.998
Okay.

26:26.818 --> 26:29.586
Why are you here?

26:29.621 --> 26:32.891
Normally guys do their social
service where they live.

26:32.926 --> 26:36.884
My father lives here.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.466
But you don't live with them.

26:41.501 --> 26:44.453
No, my dad has
a new family.

26:44.488 --> 26:47.370
He doesn't even
know I'm here.

26:47.405 --> 26:51.398
I wanted to leave my small
town and go to the big city.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.612
My father left when I was 14.

26:55.647 --> 26:58.049
My mother married
a few months later,

26:58.084 --> 27:02.042
'cause she was lonely.

27:03.121 --> 27:07.114
Yeah.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.128
I gotta go.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.099
What?
Why do you have to go?

27:14.134 --> 27:18.092
I just do.
Bye!

28:16.227 --> 28:20.220
Masks on!

30:48.947 --> 30:52.940
That music's giving
me a headache.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.291
Do we have to listen to that?

31:01.326 --> 31:02.460
What kind of fucking
music is that?

31:02.495 --> 31:03.593
Are you whacko or something?

31:03.628 --> 31:07.048
I'm sorry I bothered you.
I really didn't mean to.

31:07.083 --> 31:10.468
I'll turn down the volume.
I've got a better idea;

31:10.503 --> 31:13.004
come on in and we'll
have a beer together...

31:13.039 --> 31:15.206
and I'll make up for it, okay?

31:15.241 --> 31:19.199
Come on.

31:27.952 --> 31:31.945
You know, every year, I take
a 3-week trip to North Korea.

31:33.558 --> 31:37.551
Have a seat.

31:37.662 --> 31:41.231
You can't imagine what a
beautiful country it is.

31:41.266 --> 31:45.069
How friendly the people are,
how clean the streets are.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.439
It's all so fresh,
so unspoiled, so...

31:48.474 --> 31:51.040
so human.

31:51.075 --> 31:55.068
And who do we owe that to?

31:56.547 --> 32:00.540
Him!

32:03.955 --> 32:07.948
Kim Jong-Il!

32:08.393 --> 32:10.845
So, cheers!

32:10.880 --> 32:13.263
Cheers!

32:13.298 --> 32:17.291
Nice to meet you.

32:19.170 --> 32:23.163
These are cassettes of the German
program from Radio Pyongyang.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.317
Is that a real snake?

32:32.352 --> 32:33.549
Yep.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.218
Snake whisky.

32:35.253 --> 32:37.654
A North Korean specialty.

32:37.689 --> 32:41.059
The snakes are bottled alive
and spray their venom...

32:41.094 --> 32:42.625
in death throes.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.662
It's good for rheumatism.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.629
And for...

32:46.664 --> 32:49.233
yeah, you know...

32:49.268 --> 32:53.226
love.

32:54.172 --> 32:58.165
The dance of the
rice peasant.

33:00.244 --> 33:04.237
Planting...

33:11.622 --> 33:15.615
washing...

33:20.031 --> 33:24.024
love...
love...

33:32.710 --> 33:36.703
Come here.

33:42.487 --> 33:46.480
Look, those
windows over there.

33:47.291 --> 33:49.392
Everything's dark.

33:49.427 --> 33:53.420
Everyone's alone.
No one's doing anything.

33:55.133 --> 33:57.633
People don't believe
anyone anymore,

33:57.668 --> 34:01.139
because there's nothing
left for them to believe in.

34:01.174 --> 34:05.132
Their souls are
totally empty.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.694
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

35:29.729 --> 35:32.530
What do you
have on your head?

35:32.565 --> 35:36.523
That's a night vision aid.

35:36.934 --> 35:39.337
You look like a
single combat marine.

35:39.372 --> 35:41.706
All that's missing
is your gun.

35:41.741 --> 35:43.139
So what?

35:43.174 --> 35:45.042
What're you doing here?

35:45.077 --> 35:47.990
Just swimming around a bit.

35:48.025 --> 35:50.904
I'm playing the dead man.

36:37.962 --> 36:40.798
I've still got this
stupid thing on.

36:40.833 --> 36:43.401
Lukas, you're all wet.

36:43.436 --> 36:46.602
Come on.

36:46.637 --> 36:50.630
What kind of thing is that?
Oh God, I'll take it off you.

36:52.476 --> 36:56.469
Come on in.
Calm down.

37:04.722 --> 37:07.892
Come on, sit down.
Come on, sit down.

37:07.927 --> 37:11.885
There...

37:13.931 --> 37:15.966
Here you are.

37:16.001 --> 37:18.002
No, not there.

37:18.037 --> 37:19.468
Here.

37:19.503 --> 37:22.439
Come on now.

37:22.474 --> 37:25.341
That's good.

37:25.376 --> 37:29.369
Hold still.
Hold still.

37:33.784 --> 37:35.618
Come on.

37:35.653 --> 37:39.646
Now... calm down.

37:40.791 --> 37:44.784
Calm down, come on.

37:45.062 --> 37:49.055
That's good, that's good.
You'll warm up quickly, okay?

38:45.956 --> 38:49.187
Lukas, is that you?

38:49.222 --> 38:52.419
The door was open.

38:52.797 --> 38:56.790
Where were you?

39:15.653 --> 39:18.387
Who...

39:18.422 --> 39:22.415
Who's that man?

39:38.909 --> 39:42.902
Would you give me
a towel, please?

39:43.681 --> 39:47.674
Please?

40:28.592 --> 40:32.585
When I was in India I saw a dog
that had lost 1/4 of its head.

40:36.434 --> 40:40.427
A clean cut right
across its head.

40:40.538 --> 40:44.531
It was standing in Varanasi
in a puddle, drinking.

40:46.043 --> 40:47.743
You could see the
bones and all,

40:47.778 --> 40:51.771
but it drank as if
nothing was wrong.

40:51.916 --> 40:55.180
3 weeks later I met an
Englishman who also mentioned

40:55.215 --> 40:58.445
a dog in Varanasi, that was
missing 1/4 of its head.

40:59.924 --> 41:02.560
But he hadn't seen
it 3 weeks before.

41:02.595 --> 41:04.895
He'd seen it 2 days before.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.563
You understand?

41:07.598 --> 41:11.591
That means the dog lived at
least 3 weeks with 3/4 of a head.

41:13.838 --> 41:16.907
It must've hurt so much, but
the dog couldn't know why.

41:16.942 --> 41:20.900
It's just a dog.

41:21.912 --> 41:25.905
Sometimes I don't know
why it hurts so much.

41:56.881 --> 42:00.551
Hi, my name is Johannsen.
Police department.

42:00.586 --> 42:01.617
Here.

42:01.652 --> 42:03.687
Are you Lukas Eiserbeck?

42:03.722 --> 42:05.688
Yes, what can I do for you?

42:05.723 --> 42:06.924
I'd like to ask
you some questions.

42:06.959 --> 42:10.339
May I come in?

42:10.374 --> 42:13.720
Thank you.

42:20.237 --> 42:21.672
Sorry.
Sit down.

42:21.707 --> 42:25.665
Thank you.

42:27.344 --> 42:31.337
Please, sit.

42:31.949 --> 42:34.318
You belong to the
Germania Rowing Club?

42:34.353 --> 42:36.719
Yes, I joined a
few weeks ago.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.756
Do you have a key
to the boathouse?

42:38.791 --> 42:40.055
Yeah, sure.

42:40.090 --> 42:43.827
I sometimes train early in the
morning when no one's there.

42:43.862 --> 42:47.765
Could you imagine that
someone would steal a boat?

42:47.800 --> 42:49.164
No.

42:49.199 --> 42:51.201
Anybody can go to the
club and rent a boat.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.270
Why would anybody
want to steal one?

42:53.305 --> 42:55.204
That's what I'd say, too.

42:55.239 --> 42:58.842
But a boat was actually
stolen from Germania.

42:58.877 --> 43:01.243
A racing skiff.

43:01.278 --> 43:05.271
What do you say to that?

43:10.588 --> 43:13.622
But the thief
didn't get very far.

43:13.657 --> 43:15.626
He crashed into the
first pier of a bridge,

43:15.661 --> 43:19.619
and the boat sank.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.997
So?

43:22.032 --> 43:25.069
And then he hightailed it.

43:25.104 --> 43:26.104
Or drowned.

43:26.139 --> 43:27.069
No, no, no.

43:27.104 --> 43:30.741
In that case, we'd have found
the body, but we didn't.

43:30.776 --> 43:32.308
But...

43:32.343 --> 43:36.336
We have a witness who says
he saw the man in the boat.

43:39.817 --> 43:41.083
So?

43:41.118 --> 43:43.986
Yes, it's really strange.

43:44.021 --> 43:48.014
Because the witness says that
the man rowing was wearing...

43:48.926 --> 43:52.919
something on his head that
looked like a night vision device.

43:57.701 --> 44:00.481
Could I have a
glass of water?

44:00.516 --> 44:03.262
Yes, of course.
Thank you.

44:03.841 --> 44:07.834
- Are you ill?
- Yeah, I'm dying of cold.

44:13.017 --> 44:17.010
Yes, thank you.

44:18.689 --> 44:20.791
Now I'm kind of stuck.

44:20.826 --> 44:22.825
I mean...

44:22.860 --> 44:26.397
Who's going to be rowing
around in such lousy weather

44:26.432 --> 44:29.217
at night, alone on a river?

44:29.252 --> 44:32.002
Wearing a night
vision device.

44:32.037 --> 44:33.837
Do you have any ideas?

44:33.872 --> 44:36.438
No.

44:36.473 --> 44:40.344
On the other hand, maybe
he wanted to carry out...

44:40.379 --> 44:42.678
an assault from the water.

44:42.713 --> 44:46.194
There are enough people
living on the river...

44:46.229 --> 44:49.676
who might have enemies
or people who envy them.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.690
Who's that anyway?

44:54.725 --> 44:58.718
Kim Yong... what's-his-name,
the president of North Korea.

45:01.031 --> 45:02.064
Yeah?

45:02.099 --> 45:03.734
Are you interested
in politics?

45:03.769 --> 45:05.334
No.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.471
Yeah, and he's just
standing there,

45:07.506 --> 45:09.807
the president of North Korea.

45:09.842 --> 45:13.800
Yes.

45:18.315 --> 45:20.182
Look at that!

45:20.217 --> 45:22.685
That's strange, isn't it?

45:22.720 --> 45:26.006
A snake in a
bottle of whisky.

45:26.041 --> 45:29.201
Someone found it
on the riverbank.

45:29.236 --> 45:32.362
Do you know where
it comes from?

45:32.397 --> 45:34.396
North Korea.

45:34.431 --> 45:37.835
They put poisonous
snakes in whisky bottles.

45:37.870 --> 45:41.828
Strange, eh?

45:45.809 --> 45:49.802
Hello.
Oh, it's you.

46:06.330 --> 46:09.299
Did you leave the door open?

46:09.334 --> 46:13.292
Yes.

46:21.178 --> 46:23.280
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Well...

46:23.315 --> 46:27.273
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

46:38.061 --> 46:40.062
Heinrich!

46:40.097 --> 46:43.678
Heinrich, how often
have I told you,

46:43.713 --> 46:47.260
that thing isn't
suitable for stairs!

46:55.112 --> 46:59.105
Why do you do kendo?

47:00.884 --> 47:04.877
You learn not to
move your heart.

47:05.455 --> 47:09.424
To keep control.

47:09.459 --> 47:13.452
Not to run away, even
if it sometimes hurts.

47:15.566 --> 47:18.135
As a kid, I couldn't
sleep for months,

47:18.170 --> 47:21.503
'cause our toilet was broken.

47:21.538 --> 47:24.407
My room was right
next to the bathroom,

47:24.442 --> 47:27.242
and I could hear water
splashing all night.

47:27.277 --> 47:29.580
I'd lie in bed, convinced
that there was a stranger...

47:29.615 --> 47:33.573
who never stopped peeing.

47:37.087 --> 47:41.080
When I was a kid, I'd
always wake up at night.

47:42.526 --> 47:46.519
My father was a salesman,
so he was always on trips.

47:47.164 --> 47:51.157
We didn't have much money,
so we had to rent out a room.

47:52.336 --> 47:55.137
It really bugged me,
'cos it was mine.

47:55.172 --> 47:57.941
So colleagues of my father
would sleep in my bed,

47:57.976 --> 48:01.934
and I had to sleep
next to my mother.

48:04.514 --> 48:07.701
And eh...

48:07.736 --> 48:10.853
Sometimes...

48:10.888 --> 48:14.881
I'd wake up and look through
the keyhole, and there,

48:15.259 --> 48:19.252
sitting on my bed, was
some fat guy in underwear,

48:21.064 --> 48:25.057
farting and playing
with my electric train.

48:25.702 --> 48:29.695
So eh...

48:32.910 --> 48:36.257
Once when I woke up during
the night I heard noises.

48:36.292 --> 48:39.605
My mother was gone, so I
looked through the keyhole.

48:42.352 --> 48:46.345
I saw my mother in there
with a strange man.

48:50.160 --> 48:54.153
When my father came home she
hugged
him as if nothing had happened.

49:03.640 --> 49:07.633
I've never told
anyone that before.

49:08.078 --> 49:12.071
Really?

49:38.976 --> 49:42.969
Thanks.

49:50.053 --> 49:53.322
- Bye!
- Bye!

49:53.357 --> 49:56.059
- See you soon?
- Yeah.

49:56.094 --> 50:00.052
Bye!

50:26.456 --> 50:30.127
- Look, here comes Mr. Lukas.
- Come on, we have to go.

50:30.162 --> 50:32.661
And don't be so sad.

50:32.696 --> 50:35.699
Come on, come on.
Easy does it.

50:35.734 --> 50:39.001
Now come on.
Hey, sweetie.

50:39.036 --> 50:42.105
You'll see, it
isn't so bad there.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.607
I don't wanna go to a home.

50:43.642 --> 50:44.806
You're so alone here.

50:44.841 --> 50:47.727
You'll be with
other people there.

50:47.762 --> 50:51.184
But all those
people are sick.

50:51.219 --> 50:54.607
She won't need
any more meals.

50:55.152 --> 50:57.819
You can't live alone.

50:57.854 --> 51:01.590
What about my
food and my dog?

51:01.625 --> 51:05.618
Hello, Ms. Wessel.
Please, sit down here.

51:11.601 --> 51:14.838
- I'll take your dog.
- Don't take my dog!

51:14.873 --> 51:17.406
We have to.
It can't go with you.

51:17.441 --> 51:20.761
- What about my dog?
- Someone'll take care of it.

51:20.796 --> 51:24.081
- What about my dog?
- I put the food in there.

51:24.116 --> 51:28.074
What about my dog?

51:31.188 --> 51:33.857
What about my dog?
My poor dog!

51:33.892 --> 51:37.489
Okay, that's good.

51:37.524 --> 51:41.087
I don't want to!

51:42.332 --> 51:46.068
My poor dog!

51:46.103 --> 51:47.502
It'll be cared for.

51:47.537 --> 51:49.739
- My poor dog!
- It's Okay.

51:49.774 --> 51:53.488
My poor dog!

51:53.523 --> 51:57.203
My poor dog!

52:24.641 --> 52:28.634
Eat up!

52:38.255 --> 52:40.574
- I don't want it anymore!
- Come on.

52:40.609 --> 52:42.893
I'm not interested.
Don't you see?

52:42.928 --> 52:44.294
- Going home?
- Yes.

52:44.329 --> 52:44.893
Aw, come on.

52:44.928 --> 52:48.921
Leave me be!
Okay?

54:55.725 --> 54:59.718
Oh, good evening,
Mr. Eiserbeck.

55:00.096 --> 55:01.898
What a surprise,
running into you.

55:01.933 --> 55:04.499
Nice neighborhood, huh?

55:04.534 --> 55:07.003
Yeah, I'd like to
live here, too,

55:07.038 --> 55:09.004
but being a policeman...

55:09.039 --> 55:13.032
You know how it is.
We earn peanuts.

55:14.477 --> 55:18.470
Yeah, nice neighborhood.
What are you doing here?

55:18.682 --> 55:21.349
Well, you see...

55:21.384 --> 55:24.921
I can't get that
thing outta my mind.

55:24.956 --> 55:28.023
That mysterious man rowing.

55:28.058 --> 55:32.027
I was sitting at home in
front of the TV and...

55:32.062 --> 55:36.055
suddenly I got restless, and
I felt I had to come here.

55:38.101 --> 55:41.332
Maybe he's
planning something,

55:41.367 --> 55:44.563
that guy with the row boat.

55:45.909 --> 55:49.902
So I came here and...
everything's quiet.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.544
Nothing special.

55:53.579 --> 55:57.009
Then I run into you.

55:57.420 --> 56:01.413
How do you think
he'll strike?

56:01.925 --> 56:03.758
Who?

56:03.793 --> 56:07.786
I don't know either.

56:08.665 --> 56:10.065
I have to go.

56:10.100 --> 56:14.093
Take a look.
Those bright windows.

56:14.604 --> 56:18.597
An easy target!
No problem with a good rifle.

56:23.113 --> 56:24.746
I have to go!

56:24.781 --> 56:27.650
- Don't you want...
- No, I have to go.

56:27.685 --> 56:29.152
Too bad.
See you next time.

56:29.187 --> 56:33.145
Yeah, bye!

58:41.217 --> 58:45.210
Dad!

58:46.089 --> 58:50.082
- Dad!
- Yes, I'm coming.

59:03.006 --> 59:06.109
Here you are.
Brand new!

59:06.144 --> 59:07.075
And here.

59:07.110 --> 59:10.914
- Look at this, please.
- Don't need any, thanks.

59:10.949 --> 59:14.907
Please, buy one.
Please, buy one.

59:15.251 --> 59:16.851
Here, please.

59:16.886 --> 59:20.879
- Another nice one.
- I don't need it!

59:34.370 --> 59:38.363
I was a parachutist.

59:39.008 --> 59:43.001
I parachuted over Crete.

59:44.647 --> 59:48.182
Those Tommys...

59:48.217 --> 59:52.210
They shot at us as
if we were sparrows.

59:52.789 --> 59:55.223
They shot me in the air.

59:55.258 --> 59:59.251
Underneath my knee,
upwards through the bone.

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:04.890
That crap got stuck
in there somewhere.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:09.739
A fucked-up
landing, I tell you.

01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:13.241
I was lying there...

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:16.978
with my face in the sand.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:21.006
And then a scorpion came
along and stung me in the eye.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:36.622
- More?
- No, thanks.

01:00:58.121 --> 01:01:02.114
Aren't you hungry?

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:23.702
Does he force you?

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:14.063
Oh yeah, harder.
That's good.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:18.056
Do it harder.

01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:56.597
Hi, Lukas.

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.334
We've been waiting for you.

01:03:58.369 --> 01:04:01.404
This is my neighbor.

01:04:01.439 --> 01:04:05.397
Have a seat.

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:08.242
Nice to meet you.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:11.546
I've heard a lot about
you from this dear lady.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:15.574
She told me a lot about you,
a lot of very good things.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:25.259
And uh... now...

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:27.196
you want to buy a rifle.

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:29.099
What a coincidence.

01:04:29.134 --> 01:04:30.932
That's just great.

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:34.937
I have several good
rifles for sale.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:37.139
This really tastes good.

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:39.473
Eat it up.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.576
I'm not hungry anyway.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:45.604
- Can I have a knife?
- Yes, here you are.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.093
I have an excellent rifle
for a good marksman.

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:09.871
Really very good.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:13.899
Of course, you'll need
a telescopic lens, too.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:18.570
I also have an excellent
telescopic lens from Jena.

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:19.981
Oh!

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:23.586
- Would you like some coffee?
- I really would, thank you.

01:05:23.621 --> 01:05:27.579
And you'll need
ammunition, too.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:32.717
Hollow-tip bullets.
Familiar with them?

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:36.465
Hollow-tip bullets splatter.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.299
That's very good.

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:41.170
Even if they don't strike the
target in the heart...

01:05:41.205 --> 01:05:44.340
or in the head,
the target is finished.

01:05:44.375 --> 01:05:48.333
Isn't that nice?

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:53.071
I can really recommend
hollow-tip bullets.

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:57.175
Anyway, they're the only
ones I have on offer now.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:13.078
CONQUER YOUR FEAR

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:20.129
There is an
invisible enemy,

01:08:20.163 --> 01:08:23.198
and that enemy...

01:08:23.234 --> 01:08:26.801
is fear.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.772
Remember your childhood.

01:08:29.807 --> 01:08:32.707
You're lying in bed.

01:08:32.743 --> 01:08:35.408
It's dark.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.078
Your jacket is
hanging on a chair.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:42.107
Together, the chair and the
jacket become a monster...

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:45.152
which you're afraid of.

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:49.180
Your fear increases, and you
have to turn on the light.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:55.328
What has happened?

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:59.357
It isn't the monster that
makes you afraid, no.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:05.608
It's fear that
creates the monster!

01:09:05.643 --> 01:09:08.475
Fear is the monster.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:12.504
The monster lives inside us.

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:16.185
We create the
monster ourselves,

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:19.920
so we can also control it.

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:23.948
It is our fear that makes
the chair into a monster.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:32.328
Fear alone doesn't exist.

01:09:32.363 --> 01:09:35.960
Fear cannot exist without us.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:44.736
We know our fear keeps
us from being happy.

01:09:50.519 --> 01:09:54.512
But when something stands in
the way of your happiness,

01:09:57.893 --> 01:10:01.886
then rip it out of the way.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:06.200
Kill it!

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:10.228
Cut off the monster's head!

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.176
Do you know how
I learned German?

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:18.847
By reading Thomas Mann.
Do you like Thomas Mann?

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.648
Yes.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:23.135
We only had 2 books
in our library,

01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:25.553
"Buddenbrooks" and
"Magic Mountain. "

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:29.581
I read them 20 or 30 times,
and then I was able to speak German.

01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:36.498
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:38.365
Have a seat.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.836
And then I discovered Goethe.

01:10:40.871 --> 01:10:43.237
"Above all the
peaks is peace,

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:46.275
in all the treetops
hardly a sigh you sense.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.444
Wait, soon you
will know silence. "

01:10:48.479 --> 01:10:52.437
Isn't that excellent?

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:56.841
I've brought you everything
that you ordered.

01:10:57.453 --> 01:11:00.256
In excellent condition,
really perfect.

01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:01.622
I have to congratulate you.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.891
You've ordered a
very nice rifle,

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:07.919
and I feel that guns can be
just as nice as literature,

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:14.359
art, Kokoschka.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:20.832
Well!

01:13:57.232 --> 01:14:01.225
A beer, please.

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:04.856
Shit!

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:13.942
Being a good shot begins
with the way you breathe.

01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:17.935
You have to breathe
rhythmically.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.750
And when you shoot,
you hold your breath.

01:15:21.785 --> 01:15:24.720
Understand?

01:15:24.755 --> 01:15:26.053
Okay.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:29.725
Inhale, exhale...

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.825
Inhale...

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.853
exhale halfway,
hold your breath...

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.844
Let me show you.
Give me that.

01:15:48.879 --> 01:15:51.245
Our target!

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.950
You take the rifle and push it up
tightly against your shoulder.

01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:55.682
Here.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:59.710
And you pull back here and
here, so it's really tight.

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:03.025
Put your cheek, your head
down in line with the

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:06.662
sighting notch and
close the one eye.

01:16:06.697 --> 01:16:08.328
Now do it yourself.

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:11.066
Now move your feet apart,
in line with your shoulders.

01:16:11.101 --> 01:16:13.000
Yes!
Steady!

01:16:13.035 --> 01:16:14.670
Move your right
foot back a bit.

01:16:14.705 --> 01:16:15.903
That's good.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.307
You can't stand there like
you're on the dancefloor.

01:16:18.342 --> 01:16:20.008
Head down, left eye closed.

01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:21.677
You see something?

01:16:21.712 --> 01:16:22.609
Yeah?

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:23.744
The sighting notch?

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.881
Stand steady, without moving.

01:16:25.916 --> 01:16:26.680
Okay.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.584
Okay, and don't
forget to breathe.

01:16:28.619 --> 01:16:32.199
Now!

01:16:32.234 --> 01:16:35.780
Yes!!

01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:59.146
Hello!

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:03.174
I thought you
were Mr. Grinna.

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:05.854
He's the hunter around here.

01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:08.491
But you're not Mr. Grinna.

01:17:08.526 --> 01:17:11.806
Are you a hunter, too?

01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:15.086
Yeah, I'm a hunter.

01:17:16.098 --> 01:17:20.091
A strange rifle.

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:21.301
It isn't strange.

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:25.329
It has a silencer
for wild ducks.

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:32.770
Exactly.
Wild ducks.

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.968
And who are you?

01:17:37.003 --> 01:17:39.653
I'm the shepherd.

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:41.922
I look after the sheep.

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:44.159
But there aren't
any wild ducks now.

01:17:44.194 --> 01:17:47.127
It's too cold.
Too cold.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:51.155
I gotta go.
I gotta get moving again.

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:45.896
Could you help me a bit?

01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:55.339
I can hardly walk now.

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:21.632
My wife.

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:27.137
The Tommys tried to
court-martial her after the war.

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:33.321
A half year later, she
ran off to England

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:37.257
with a military judge.

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:41.285
I really loved her.
That bitch.

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:42.662
Know what's strange?

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:45.565
Just at the moment when I...

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:49.593
pull the trigger,
I close my eyes.

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:55.108
That was the mistake.

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:58.213
There were soldiers who,
even after 6 years of war,

01:21:58.248 --> 01:22:02.206
shut their eyes when
they pulled the trigger.

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:06.955
It's the fear of shooting.

01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:08.688
And you...

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:12.716
are afraid to shoot.

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:18.099
I'm not afraid.

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:19.332
So...

01:22:19.367 --> 01:22:23.360
Thank you for coming,
and...

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:28.165
don't forget...
conquer your fear.

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.426
Well, what a surprise!

01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:46.326
You're here, too.

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:50.354
Trying to get motivated?

01:22:50.699 --> 01:22:54.000
Well, that's not a bad idea.

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:56.970
It's funny running
into you here.

01:22:57.005 --> 01:23:00.998
I've been thinking a
lot about you recently.

01:23:01.042 --> 01:23:05.035
It was quite an interesting
conversation we had the last time...

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:09.373
when we met by the river.

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:14.778
I feel you're
planning something.

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:18.727
Of course, that's my
job to collect clues.

01:23:18.762 --> 01:23:22.720
But I know you're
planning something.

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:27.191
Hey, am I right?
Be honest.

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:33.364
Yes, believe me, I've
had a lot of experience.

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:39.036
20 years of working for
the police is a long time.

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:43.516
You know, I like you.

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:47.544
It'd be best for you
if I arrested you.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:50.658
I'm sure of that.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:53.093
But I can't.

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:56.531
I don't have anything on you.

01:23:56.566 --> 01:24:00.524
Excuse me.

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:45.803
Heart attack.

01:26:46.834 --> 01:26:48.369
Where's my boat?

01:26:48.404 --> 01:26:49.836
Too late.

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:53.864
Your oar's already taken.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.953
Hey, Lukas!

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:08.489
Hey, Lukas!
Come back here!

01:27:08.524 --> 01:27:12.482
What's the big idea?

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:26.930
Put that boat back in place!

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:22.052
Hello, Isabella.
It's me, Lukas.

01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:26.323
I just wanted to get
in touch, 'cause...

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:29.971
I've been looking for you
everywhere, but you're...

01:28:30.006 --> 01:28:33.640
actually, you're never there.

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:36.010
Maybe we could get
together sometime.

01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:40.003
Call me back.
Bye.

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:09.566
Hello, Isabella.
It's me, Lukas, again.

01:29:09.877 --> 01:29:13.881
I'm calling, because I
have two things to say.

01:29:13.916 --> 01:29:17.317
First of all...

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:19.420
I know what happened.

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:21.539
I was there.

01:29:21.574 --> 01:29:23.589
And eh...

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:27.617
And eh... second...

01:29:30.398 --> 01:29:33.662
I'm going to tell
you something,

01:29:33.697 --> 01:29:36.927
and I hope you'll
please call back!

01:29:41.075 --> 01:29:45.068
I got myself a rifle, and
I've learned how to shoot,

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:51.041
quite well actually, and I
really wanted to kill him.

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:31.581
How's your girl doing?

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:38.722
I don't know.

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:43.604
I don't know
what she's doing.

01:30:43.639 --> 01:30:47.597
I'm sorry, Lukas.

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.611
You look pale.

01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:55.639
Do you have a temperature?

01:31:01.656 --> 01:31:05.649
Bye.

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:22.466
Good evening!

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:28.538
No boat today?

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:35.588
I've stopped rowing.

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:39.258
Don't start getting
lazy, young man.

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:43.286
The water's coming in faster
and getting higher every day.

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:49.693
You'll see, it'll soon cover
the entire surface of the earth,

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:54.498
pure and virginal,
like on the first day.

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:07.255
Maybe we can play the
dead man together.

01:32:07.290 --> 01:32:11.248
Someday.

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:18.154
See you.

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:44.828
Isabella!

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:48.140
Are you coming, too?

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:52.168
No, I'd rather go
home early tonight.

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:05.248
Isabella!

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:58.478
You're still awake?

01:36:58.513 --> 01:37:00.579
Should I read to him?

01:37:00.614 --> 01:37:04.251
- Yes, please.
- No, I'm putting him to bed.

01:37:04.286 --> 01:37:06.949
Good night!

01:37:06.984 --> 01:37:09.612
Sleep tight.

01:38:09.613 --> 01:38:12.413
