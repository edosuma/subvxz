have been tempered,

17:49.527 --> 17:52.071
it's time to turn them
into fully functional weapons

17:52.071 --> 17:53.906
by attaching handles to them.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.283
Now, in the first round,

17:55.283 --> 17:58.703
we gave you twists

Correcting a warp

crack the blade,

18:57.762 --> 18:59.889
<i>I wrap it in a whole bunch</i>
<i>of wet paper towels</i>

18:59.889 --> 19:01.807

heat from the torch.

on these things?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.040

19:26.040 --> 19:28.751
The circumference is pi D,

19:28.751 --> 19:30.920
so 8 times 3 is 24,

19:30.920 --> 19:33.047
so two feet every time
it turns one.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.758
That's about 15,000 feet
per minute.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.427
- You're getting math on me.
Stop it.

- All right, DJ,
this weapon is heavy.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.997
That balance point
is so far forward.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.625
Keeping that tip up is brutal.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.045
You've got a really, really
super stout edge,

38:17.045 --> 38:19.714
and, honestly,
it held up quite well.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.717
There's some rolls here
where it connected,

38:22.717 --> 38:26.346

38:26.346 --> 38:27.555
It's a strong blade.

- Thank you.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.975

38:30.975 --> 38:32.560
your blades are still
in one piece.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.437
Now let's see
if they still have an edge.

38:34.437 --> 38:37.398
To test that edge, I'll be
cutting through this cane.

38:37.398 --> 38:38.525
Todd, you're up.
You ready?

38:38.525 --> 38:40.360

You did a good job
