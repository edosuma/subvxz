WEBVTT

01:02.041 --> 01:05.583
- ( chatter )
- ( traffic blaring )

01:10.792 --> 01:14.166
( sirens wailing
in distance )

01:15.291 --> 01:16.667
( exhales )

01:16.667 --> 01:19.291
( breathing heavily )

01:22.917 --> 01:24.083
You okay?

01:24.083 --> 01:26.667
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.333
Oh, man.

01:28.333 --> 01:31.792
I can still breathe,
so I don't know if it counts
as a panic attack

01:31.792 --> 01:34.875
if I can still breathe,
but my heart is really--

01:35.959 --> 01:37.917
maybe slowed down.

01:37.917 --> 01:39.417
Are the kids
still in there?

01:39.417 --> 01:41.875
In the classroom
where you left them?
Yeah.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.417
Great, great.

01:43.417 --> 01:46.250
Apparently Ashanti
brought a gerbil to school
in her pocket

01:46.250 --> 01:47.542
and crushed its brain,

01:47.542 --> 01:51.000
so they've moved on
to bigger and better things.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.959
Is that something
that happens a lot?

01:55.500 --> 01:59.125
There's just been a lot
going on lately with my...

01:59.125 --> 02:01.041
family.

02:04.542 --> 02:06.500
Yeah.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.583
My dad decided
that he's, um--

02:12.083 --> 02:14.041
well, I don't
know if he decided,
he just figured--

02:14.041 --> 02:15.458
he's not--

02:15.458 --> 02:18.417
You know what?
Don't need to tell me.

02:18.417 --> 02:19.875
Okay.

02:19.875 --> 02:21.375
I'm gonna go back
up there in a second.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.708
I just need
to breathe a little

02:22.708 --> 02:25.667
and then I'm gonna
be ready to rock.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.750
Everything's
under control up there.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.208
You take as much time
as you need.

02:36.375 --> 02:38.000
Is this okay?

02:51.959 --> 02:55.083
Shoshanna:
So I was really inspired
by working on his campaign

02:55.083 --> 02:56.750
and, you know,
seeing all of the change

02:56.750 --> 02:58.750
that he's already
been able to make
in his neighborhood

02:58.750 --> 03:00.333
regarding
the traffic lights.

03:00.333 --> 03:03.417
It reinvigorated
my job search, so here I am.

03:03.417 --> 03:07.000
And I don't think
that I need to overplay
my resume, you know?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.917
It's not exhaustive,
but I have really stuck
with the jobs that I've had

03:09.917 --> 03:11.750
and I am
incredibly educated

03:11.750 --> 03:12.917
about the current
corporate climate

03:12.917 --> 03:15.667
and also what marketing means
in the digital age.

03:15.667 --> 03:18.291
Well, I think
you just really hit
the nail on the head.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.917
I mean, that's
the company ethos,

03:19.917 --> 03:24.458
and we want employees
who understand the lifestyle
and the message,

03:24.458 --> 03:28.583
so I think there is a position
you'd be perfect for.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.792
- It involves marketing...
- A passion area.

03:31.792 --> 03:35.500
- ...and social media...
- Okay, also, like,
a joy of mine.

03:35.500 --> 03:39.583
...and acting as a liaison
between our Japanese
brand leadership

03:39.583 --> 03:41.959
and our American
sales team.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.166
Amazing.

03:43.166 --> 03:47.166
Um, but how would you feel
about relocating to Tokyo?

03:47.166 --> 03:50.041
At least for the time being.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.792
Um... me?

03:52.792 --> 03:54.667
Yeah, you.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.041
Tokyo.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.458
It's the coolest.

03:57.458 --> 04:01.166
We have a great team of expats
working in Tokyo,

04:01.166 --> 04:05.375
and they've all found the city
hijo ni subarashii,

04:05.375 --> 04:09.708
which means "very nice"
in Japanese.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.834
Japanese is super easy
to get the hang of.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.208
It's just, like,
four sounds

04:14.208 --> 04:17.250
that you kind of, like,
loop around and put together.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.916
It's like, "hi,"
and then like, "jo."

04:19.916 --> 04:22.917
Um, so, like,
how frequently do you go--

04:22.917 --> 04:24.375
travel to Japan?

04:24.375 --> 04:25.583
I have not been.

04:25.583 --> 04:30.250
But I get
a lot of visual aids
from the Internet

04:30.250 --> 04:34.166
and I have Skyped
with people in Tokyo.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.166
I'll go, like, "Hi!"

04:36.166 --> 04:38.750
And they will do
"Hi!" back.

04:38.750 --> 04:42.792
Um, can-- is, uh--
is it possible

04:42.792 --> 04:45.917
to think about it
just for a moment?

04:45.917 --> 04:47.667
Totally.
Think about it.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.917
I probably need to know
by Wednesday, probably.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.125
- Okay.
- Okay?

04:51.125 --> 04:53.458
To be completely frank,

04:53.458 --> 04:56.166
Lydia, who is currently
holding the position,

04:56.166 --> 04:58.000
is, um, bipolar.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.166
- Oh.
- And we are
gonna fire her

05:00.166 --> 05:04.083
pretty much the minute
she's on a manic upswing.

05:07.083 --> 05:10.375
- Japan.
- ( laughs ) Yeah.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.834
( Caroline moaning )
Yes!

05:13.834 --> 05:17.083
Oh, yes!

05:17.083 --> 05:19.333
Oh!

05:19.333 --> 05:23.500
( moaning continues )

05:28.625 --> 05:30.542
- Hannah.
- Hey, Laird.

05:30.542 --> 05:31.583
Wow, glad you made it.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.542
Come in,
shoeless, of course.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.708
( Caroline
continues moaning )

05:40.750 --> 05:42.875
You sure everything's
okay in here?

05:42.875 --> 05:44.625
- 'Cause...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.417
Those are just shouts
of maternal celebration.

05:47.417 --> 05:49.959
- ( music playing )
- Hon Bun, look who it is.

05:49.959 --> 05:52.583
Caroline:
Oh, Hannah.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.250
Hannah.
It's my birth, Hannah.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.333
Yeah.

05:56.333 --> 05:59.125
No, it's great.
It seems... fun and relaxed.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.750
And, like, you just--
you got this, girl.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.333
So I'm gonna
head back upstairs.
Bye.

06:03.333 --> 06:07.250
- Caroline: No, no, Hannah.
Stay, stay, please stay.
- Laird: Yeah.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.875
Laird is my doula,

06:08.875 --> 06:12.125
and between you and me,
he could use a little help.

06:12.125 --> 06:14.917
Well, I'm not
officially trained.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.792
Caroline just told me
everything she knows

06:16.792 --> 06:18.792
and I already cried once.

06:18.792 --> 06:21.166
Is Caroline even a doula?

06:21.166 --> 06:22.500
Yep, almost.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.542
She is almost a doula.

06:25.542 --> 06:28.500
Okay, well,
I don't actually
think this is legal,

06:28.500 --> 06:30.291
to self-doula.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.792
Yeah, this is
pretty legal, right?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.125
Fuck the legal system.

06:34.125 --> 06:37.458
Laird:
Uh, we're trying to keep
a positive spin on things.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.458
This baby is a month
and a half early,

06:39.458 --> 06:42.250
but it knows that
we are ready, right?

06:42.250 --> 06:47.083
We are ready and waiting
for you to come out.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.542
Caroline:
Oh, you want Hannah to stay?

06:48.542 --> 06:52.250
Laird:
Oh, you want Hannah to stay?
Yeah, that's a great idea.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.333
- That is so beautiful.
- Antique. Yeah.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.625
- Congratulations.
- Oh, my God, you're
a record company president.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.041
You do not care
about my ring.

06:58.041 --> 06:59.625
- No, of course I do.
- I'm such a dork!

06:59.625 --> 07:01.875
- Oh, my God,
I'm so embarrassed.
- Marcos: No, it's beautiful.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.291
- Congratulations.
- Desi: Thank you.

07:03.291 --> 07:04.834
Marnie:
Thank you.
We're so happy.

07:04.834 --> 07:07.792
Desi: Marriage is such
an antiquated concept
on so many levels,

07:07.792 --> 07:10.166
but until they discover
something better,

07:10.166 --> 07:12.917
you know, this is really
the only way I know how

07:12.917 --> 07:15.500
to express my eternal
devotion to Marnie.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.625
Marnie:
Oh, my God.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.041
Plus, I don't
believe in tattoos,

07:18.041 --> 07:19.667
so this is
our only option.

07:19.667 --> 07:22.125
All I can say is that marriage
is the best thing I ever did.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.375
- I love hearing that.
- Oh, God, yeah.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.250
How long have you
been married for, Marcos?

07:26.250 --> 07:29.458
10 years now,
including this most
recent separation.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.250
- Oh.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.667
I mean, actually,
the hardest part is actually

07:32.667 --> 07:35.625
just trying
to FaceTime with Piper
and she's only three.

07:35.625 --> 07:39.500
She keeps trying
to touch Daddy's face
through the screen

07:39.500 --> 07:42.708
and gets really confused
and starts...

07:45.166 --> 07:46.875
Wow, I'm really sorry.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.291
No, I'm sorry.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.291
- Holy shit,
I'm sorry.
- No.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.375
Marcos:
You guys are not lunatics,
so you're gonna make it.

07:52.375 --> 07:53.834
And let's talk
about the showcase.

07:53.834 --> 07:55.333
I just want to get
your equipment needs

07:55.333 --> 07:58.208
so I can get them
to the guitar techs
and everyone.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.708
Wow, totally.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.291
I can't believe
how hands-on you are.

08:02.291 --> 08:03.875
You're the label president.
This is crazy.

08:03.875 --> 08:07.125
No, no, let's just pretend
we're all doing this together
in a garage somewhere.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.792
Okay, well, all of our gear
is in the back of Desi's truck,

08:09.792 --> 08:11.291
so it won't be
that hard to pretend.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.542
Marcos:
Great, I'll be your roadie.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.542
Desi:
Why don't you guys do that?
Let me get this.

08:14.542 --> 08:16.208
Bye, Ray-Ray.

08:16.208 --> 08:17.959
Ray...
( claps )

08:17.959 --> 08:20.792
( speaks Spanish )

08:20.792 --> 08:24.208
I gotta settle up.
We had three espressos,

08:24.208 --> 08:28.750
two of these delicious scones,
and, um, one glass of water.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.417
Water's free.

08:30.417 --> 08:32.375
Oh, that's a very
generous policy.

08:32.375 --> 08:35.207
( beeping )

08:35.207 --> 08:37.707
Hey, Ray, let me
ask you something, man.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.041
Are we solid?

08:42.041 --> 08:43.750
Excuse me?

08:43.750 --> 08:45.542
Are you and I solid,
you know?

08:45.542 --> 08:46.834
Are we simpatico?

08:46.834 --> 08:51.417
Because sometimes
I get this sense that
there's some...

08:51.417 --> 08:53.625
tension
or like a bad line.

08:53.625 --> 08:58.500
Not really between us,
but specifically
from you to me.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.417
Well, I really wouldn't
worry about it if I were you.

09:01.417 --> 09:02.625
Okay, but you know what?

09:02.625 --> 09:04.208
I do worry about
those kinds of things

09:04.208 --> 09:06.708
'cause I'm exactly
the kind of person
that needs to know

09:06.708 --> 09:08.959
that none of my lines
are faulty, you know?

09:08.959 --> 09:12.500
That I'm making
everybody around me happy.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.000
- That make sense?
- It does, it does make sense.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.708
Unfortunately, Desi,
you're not gonna get that
assurance from me today.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.417
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:20.417 --> 09:22.125
Can you expound on that?

09:23.166 --> 09:24.917
You're not gonna get
that assurance from me

09:24.917 --> 09:27.417
because I fucking
hate you.

09:31.125 --> 09:34.625
Well, I totally get
that we're from very
different parts of the world,

09:34.625 --> 09:37.792
and I don't expect
everybody here to...

09:37.792 --> 09:41.000
fully understand my kind
of Pacific Northwest thing.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.917
Your whole Boston vibe
can be very abrasive.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.000
Okay, Desi, this isn't
about where you're from.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
- Okay.
- Okay?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.667
- This isn't
about geography.
- Uh-huh.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.583
This is about that
distressed shirt
you're wearing.

09:50.583 --> 09:55.000
This is about the fact
that you have eyeliner
on your face right now.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.250
This is about the fact
that your musical sensibility
is insufferable.

09:58.250 --> 10:02.000
Don't ever think that you
get onstage anywhere

10:02.000 --> 10:05.750
where a vast majority
of the crowd doesn't
think "douche."

10:05.750 --> 10:07.166
Douche.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.500
You know how
you feel when you watch
Imagine Dragons play?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.083
Well, that's how
we feel about you.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.417
And you know what?
Imagine Dragons are great
and you're  the douche.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.000
You know, if we
just take a minute

10:16.000 --> 10:20.083
and put our hearts together,
you and me right here,

10:20.083 --> 10:22.792
I think we'll both find

10:22.792 --> 10:25.000
that we're not really
all that different.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.875
But we are different.

10:26.875 --> 10:31.500
We are very different,
because I would never
treat her like shit.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.250
Who, Marnie?

10:33.250 --> 10:36.667
Yes, Marnie.
Marnie Michaels.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.542
Okay, now you're
talking about my fiancée,

10:39.542 --> 10:42.542
and I strongly suggest, Ray,
that you proceed with caution.

10:42.542 --> 10:43.792
Yeah, I know
she's your fiancée.

10:43.792 --> 10:47.375
I also know that you
absolutely do not
deserve her.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.000
Even remotely.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.959
You string her along
for months

10:50.959 --> 10:52.250
and now you've
proposed to her

10:52.250 --> 10:55.000
in some desperate bid
to make it seem
like you're not

10:55.000 --> 10:57.291
the most selfish
person in the western
fucking hemisphere,

10:57.291 --> 10:59.000
but you know what, Desi?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.291
I'm onto you.

11:00.291 --> 11:05.125
Marnie isn't some tool
for you to stroke
your ego with.

11:05.125 --> 11:08.000
She's a beautiful,
fully formed woman,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.417
dazzling in her complexity,
maddening in her mystery,

11:11.417 --> 11:14.250
and you underestimate her
every fucking day.

11:14.250 --> 11:18.875
And because of that,
you will never, ever

11:18.875 --> 11:20.250
make her truly happy.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.667
Truly, deeply,
fundamentally happy.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.750
You're gonna try and fuck up
and try and fuck up again.

11:25.750 --> 11:30.959
And every time,
she will smile and
take you back.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.208
Well, thank you for that.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.875
Keep your fucking
blood money.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.792
I love it when you
join me for lunch.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.667
I go back to the office
and I'm invigorated

11:49.667 --> 11:53.625
and I have
all these great ideas
and it's all because of you.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.750
( chuckles )

11:54.750 --> 11:57.792
Oh, so this weekend,
Amagansett.

11:57.792 --> 12:02.208
Bryce is having
one of his famous,
crazy, weird parties.

12:02.208 --> 12:04.667
I think he has, like,
half of the cast

12:04.667 --> 12:07.792
of the Cirque du Soleil--
um, I can't remember--
the sexy one.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.708
Anyway, it's gonna
be really great.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.083
- Hey, I have to
tell you something.
- Mm-hmm?

12:12.083 --> 12:14.792
Um... I got a job.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.375
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

12:16.375 --> 12:19.625
- That's so cool.
- Yeah, um...

12:19.625 --> 12:21.125
in Japan.

12:21.125 --> 12:22.583
It's really--
it's incredible.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.417
It's, um-- it's, like,
a very high-level job.

12:24.417 --> 12:27.250
It's in marketing,
it's kind of-- no,
it's my dream job.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.417
It's totally my dream job.
You know, I'm totally down

12:29.417 --> 12:31.542
to be your
Japanese booty call

12:31.542 --> 12:34.375
- and that's so fine
and amazing, but I just--
- Don't--

12:34.375 --> 12:37.000
- You know, it's like,
we can continue on the phone.
- Don't-- don't take the job.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.500
- Shoshanna, don't take
that job, okay?
- What?

12:39.500 --> 12:41.125
- Okay?
- Just-- what?

12:41.125 --> 12:42.417
Just don't take it.

12:42.417 --> 12:43.959
You can work
at Madame Tinsley's, okay?

12:43.959 --> 12:46.708
And move in with me.
Yes, move in with me.

12:46.708 --> 12:49.291
I know that's fast,
but you can't go to Japan.

12:49.291 --> 12:52.166
Don't take that job.

12:52.166 --> 12:55.959
- Um...
- I'm gonna be in love
with you soon.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.375
Oh, okay.

13:01.208 --> 13:04.291
( low moaning )

13:06.667 --> 13:09.792
Uh, Laird, this whole thing
seems kind of crazy.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.333
Uh, how can it
be crazy, Hannah?

13:11.333 --> 13:14.542
- It's happening.
- Okay, yeah, but just because
something's happening

13:14.542 --> 13:16.333
doesn't mean
it's not crazy.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.667
Doesn't it?

13:17.667 --> 13:19.875
- No, crazy things
happen every--
- ( door bursts open )

13:19.875 --> 13:21.500
( panting )

13:22.542 --> 13:24.291
Hey.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.792
( Caroline
continues moaning )

13:27.792 --> 13:30.208
No.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.708
( inhales )

13:31.708 --> 13:34.333
Oh, I'm so happy
you're here.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.375
What the fuck
are you doing?

13:37.375 --> 13:41.166
Oh, even for you,
that's a dim little question.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.542
This is the dumbest idea
that's ever happened.

13:46.542 --> 13:47.750
That's what I was
trying to tell them,

13:47.750 --> 13:50.041
only just in less
kind of combative words.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.834
Oh, don't be
so Western, you two.

13:52.834 --> 13:55.542
- Cover your boobs,
please.
- Fine.

13:55.542 --> 13:59.917
But for obvious reasons,
I'm not gonna cover
my vagina.

14:00.875 --> 14:03.375
We got it on lock,
brother.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.834
What's that?

14:06.834 --> 14:11.542
Uh, we-- we're--
we got the situation
under control.

14:11.542 --> 14:13.917
We got it on lockdown.

14:13.917 --> 14:15.083
Oh, good to know.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.959
Because if there's a problem,
those are usually handled

14:17.959 --> 14:21.375
by modern
fucking medicine!

14:21.375 --> 14:23.125
Fuck the modern
fucking medicine, okay?

14:23.125 --> 14:24.667
I am not going
to distance myself

14:24.667 --> 14:27.208
from the beautiful
and natural process
that is birth

14:27.208 --> 14:31.417
by tubes and drugs
and fucking white lab coats.

14:31.417 --> 14:32.959
I'm going
to inhabit my body

14:32.959 --> 14:35.083
and bring this baby
into a world

14:35.083 --> 14:37.250
of aware,
peaceful individuals

14:37.250 --> 14:38.542
and not fucking
drug-addicted robots.

14:38.542 --> 14:41.500
So you would have
open-heart surgery
in your living room?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.333
Maybe, yeah.
Maybe I would.

14:43.333 --> 14:46.458
You know, I watched
the Ricki Lake-produced
documentary

14:46.458 --> 14:48.375
"The Business of Being Born,"
and it let me know

14:48.375 --> 14:50.083
that there's a lot
of different angles
on this.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.750
Laird: I agree. There was
a "Tom and Jerry" episode--

14:52.750 --> 14:54.959
they were on the plains
in frontier times

14:54.959 --> 14:59.708
and Tom was having a baby
and Jerry was a cowboy--

14:59.708 --> 15:02.041
Shut the fuck up!

15:02.041 --> 15:02.959
You listen to me.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.458
That is the father
of my child, okay?

15:04.458 --> 15:07.375
And that man loves me
and treats me as I should be
treated by a man

15:07.375 --> 15:09.375
and you don't talk to him
like that, ever!

15:09.375 --> 15:11.250
( Caroline gasps, moans )

15:14.125 --> 15:16.291
Ray?

15:16.291 --> 15:18.000
Ray?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.542
- Ray!
- Ah, shush!

15:20.542 --> 15:22.500
You're making
my migraine twerk.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.166
Hi, Hermie.
Is Ray here?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.625
Because it's a little bit
of an emergency

15:25.625 --> 15:27.166
and it also has a little bit
of a clock on it.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.000
Break a heel
in a subway grate?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.667
No, actually.

15:30.667 --> 15:33.250
I was offered
a high-powered job
in Japan

15:33.250 --> 15:35.667
and I need his advice
on whether or not to take it.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.667
Well, Ray's not here
right now.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.667
Okay, well, do you know
where Ray is?

15:39.667 --> 15:41.000
Ray's a politician now.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.041
He's shaking hands
and kissing babies.

15:43.041 --> 15:46.917
That's his life.
We're no longer part of it.

15:46.917 --> 15:48.667
( groans )

15:48.667 --> 15:51.667
Job offer in Japan's
not a bad thing to have.

15:52.708 --> 15:55.208
Yeah, I guess so.

15:55.208 --> 15:58.166
I don't know
if I'm gonna take it.
I just--

15:58.166 --> 16:01.458
I'm kind of on the precipice
of, like, possibly
falling in love

16:01.458 --> 16:04.166
with a very successful,
very kind,

16:04.166 --> 16:05.542
very fashionable man,

16:05.542 --> 16:07.583
and I just feel like
if I don't give this
relationship a shot,

16:07.583 --> 16:08.792
then I'm gonna regret it
my entire life.

16:08.792 --> 16:10.917
And he offered me a job
at his company, so I feel like--

16:10.917 --> 16:13.667
Stop, stop, stop, please.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.417
What, does that--
does that not make sense?

16:15.417 --> 16:17.834
It makes sense like
a Danielle Steel novel

16:17.834 --> 16:19.375
makes sense to a woman
with emphysema.

16:19.375 --> 16:21.250
I'm gonna tell you
something.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.375
Be the walker,
not the dog.

16:25.417 --> 16:26.708
What?

16:26.708 --> 16:30.208
You familiar with the work
of the writer Sheryl Sandberg?

16:30.208 --> 16:32.875
Um, yes, I'm familiar
with the works

16:32.875 --> 16:35.583
of the writer
Sheryl Sandberg.
Are you?

16:35.583 --> 16:38.542
Yes, my wife
left a copy out and I saw
an attractive woman,

16:38.542 --> 16:40.250
I read the book.
I'm a convert.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.250
This is your
"lean in" moment.

16:42.250 --> 16:43.875
This is your moment
to lean in.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.834
You don't want to be
dependent on some guy,
some nerd.

16:46.834 --> 16:49.458
Don't give the power
to your partner.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.959
Grab a seat at the table
and lean the fuck in.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.166
And if this guy's
worth his salt,

16:54.166 --> 16:57.417
he'll be waiting
for you at the airport
when you return.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.708
This is for you,
taking what's yours.

17:00.708 --> 17:02.291
Attainment,
achievement--

17:02.291 --> 17:04.250
this is your time
to grasp your destiny.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.416
- What you--
- Yeah, no, I get it,
I get it, I get it.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.750
Thank you.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.416
You are very strange.

17:11.416 --> 17:14.040
But you're very wise.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.959
( Caroline moaning loudly )

17:15.959 --> 17:19.583
I want to go in there and see
what's happening so bad.
Do you think it's gory?

17:19.583 --> 17:22.583
No, it just looks like me
after I've eaten, like,
a big Mexican dinner.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.875
- Hannah.
- No, but, like,
her actual pussy.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.959
- What's happening?
- Oh, I didn't get
to see her pussy.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.625
Adam, did you see it?

17:30.625 --> 17:33.375
I didn't fucking look.
That's my fucking sister!

17:33.375 --> 17:36.417
Adam, maybe you should look
because  it's your sister.

17:36.417 --> 17:39.417
( Caroline screaming )

17:39.417 --> 17:42.375
( door opens, closes )

17:42.375 --> 17:45.041
Okay, something
is not right.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.208
Motherfucker,
I told you.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.625
I think something
is really wrong.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.708
Okay, Laird, we need you
to be more articulate

17:49.708 --> 17:51.417
if you want us
to help you.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.834
Okay, she-- she is
writhing in pain

17:53.834 --> 17:55.291
and she is
really feeling it,

17:55.291 --> 17:58.333
and she is screaming--
you can all currently
hear all that right now.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.083
And even I know that that
should not happen unless--

18:01.083 --> 18:04.375
you're supposed to be
five to 10 dilated for
that kind of pain, right?

18:04.375 --> 18:06.041
And she is only
three fingers wide.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.458
I'm calling an ambulance.
Motherfucker, I know
where you live.

18:08.458 --> 18:10.834
No, you are not
calling an-- hey, no.

18:10.834 --> 18:14.000
She will not go to a hospital.
That is not in her birth plan.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.417
What the fuck
is a birth plan?

18:15.417 --> 18:17.166
I think it's pretty
self-explanatory.

18:17.166 --> 18:19.166
It's the plan you have
for the way you're gonna
give birth,

18:19.166 --> 18:23.041
like, "I'm gonna take
the stuff that Michael Jackson
took to sleep," all right?

18:23.041 --> 18:24.834
We need to call a doctor.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.166
We are not
calling a doctor,

18:26.166 --> 18:27.708
we are not going
to the hospital.

18:27.708 --> 18:30.166
- She will murder me.
Are you kidding? No.
- ( moaning continues )

18:30.166 --> 18:32.542
You guys are all pussies,
every one of you.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.166
( panting )

18:35.166 --> 18:38.667
( screaming )

18:38.667 --> 18:42.166
Okay, Caroline,
talk to me.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.166
It hurts like
a motherfucker, Jess.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.333
Low, real low.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.500
I think she might
be breach.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.542
I need you
to check, okay?

18:48.542 --> 18:49.708
Holy shitfuck.

18:49.708 --> 18:51.375
( screaming )

18:51.375 --> 18:53.125
Uh, hey, man,
I can do that.

18:53.125 --> 18:55.208
Stay the fuck
away from me, Laird.

18:55.208 --> 18:58.125
Laird,
this isn't for you.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.166
( groans )

18:59.166 --> 19:01.708
( panting )

19:01.708 --> 19:04.375
( screaming )

19:04.375 --> 19:06.166
Oh!

19:06.166 --> 19:08.834
( panting )

19:08.834 --> 19:10.208
- I saw a foot.
- Oh, God, oh, God.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.708
Caroline:
Okay, okay,
it's breaching.

19:11.708 --> 19:15.125
- ( thuds )
- Caroline: I can deliver.
People do it every day.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.792
Baby, we need
to go to a hospital
right now, okay?

19:17.792 --> 19:18.875
Oh, God!

19:18.875 --> 19:20.083
You're just like
the rest of them.

19:20.083 --> 19:23.041
You're all part of the fucking
birth industrial complex!

19:23.041 --> 19:24.959
It's a goddamn conspiracy.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.083
- Okay...
- I'm gonna deliver
this baby by myself

19:27.083 --> 19:29.750
like a teenager
in the heartland
if I have to!

19:29.750 --> 19:33.208
- Caroline, listen to me.
Listen to me right now.
- No.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.417
I'm shutting
everybody out.

19:34.417 --> 19:37.083
I'm not listening
to any more bullshit
with my ears.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.625
I'm not gonna hear
any of you ever again,

19:38.625 --> 19:40.750
not ever, not ever,
not ever once again.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.291
( sobbing )

19:43.291 --> 19:44.875
- Laird?
- What?

19:44.875 --> 19:47.959
You need to get your wife
out of the tub.

19:47.959 --> 19:49.417
We're not married, okay?

19:49.417 --> 19:51.291
I just wear this
'cause it makes me
feel good.

19:51.291 --> 19:55.875
Laird, I need you
and she needs you
to be a man right now.

19:55.875 --> 19:57.542
But I'm not a man.

19:57.542 --> 19:58.750
( sobbing )

19:58.750 --> 20:03.250
I'm a Jewish recovering junkie
and I weigh 135 pounds!

20:03.250 --> 20:06.375
Okay, I know
you're scared right now,

20:06.375 --> 20:09.875
but if there was ever a time
to not be pathetic,

20:09.875 --> 20:11.792
it's now.

20:11.792 --> 20:15.125
I think later
is my time.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.959
That's when my time
usually is, is later.

20:17.959 --> 20:19.708
Jessa:
I'm gonna walk
out the room,

20:19.708 --> 20:21.458
you guys are gonna
have a moment,

20:21.458 --> 20:23.834
and you're gonna get her
out of the tub.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.625
( moaning continues )

20:25.625 --> 20:27.625
( exhales )

20:27.625 --> 20:29.542
Caroline...

20:29.542 --> 20:33.208
you need to get out
of the fucking tub!

20:33.208 --> 20:34.708
Eat shit, bitch!

20:34.708 --> 20:37.333
Marnie:
Desi, you really have
to call me back.

20:37.333 --> 20:40.291
We go on in half an hour.
You missed our sound check.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.792
It's fine.
I'm honestly just
worried about you,

20:42.792 --> 20:44.291
but please, sweetie,
just call me back.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.208
Bye.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.500
Any news we can use?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.959
No, but, I mean, I'm sure
he'll be here any second.

20:49.959 --> 20:52.333
Yeah, he's probably just,
like, around the corner.

20:52.333 --> 20:55.000
Okay, all the blogs are here--
"Brooklyn Vegan," "Pitchfork,"

20:55.000 --> 20:57.250
"The Fader,"
"Iron Throng,"
"Bad Breath."

20:57.250 --> 20:58.542
I know, and it's
really unlike him.

20:58.542 --> 21:01.500
Like, when it
comes to his music,
he's usually so punctual,

21:01.500 --> 21:03.333
so I'm sure he's, like,
about to get here.

21:03.333 --> 21:06.834
Well, I mean,
let's just hope he didn't
Jeff Buckley it, right?

21:06.834 --> 21:08.750
Do you mean drown?

21:08.750 --> 21:11.625
Yeah, you know,
Amy Winehouse it,

21:11.625 --> 21:13.667
Janis Joplin it,
Hendrix himself...

21:13.667 --> 21:16.959
Um, yeah, I hope
he didn't die either.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.458
Hey, dudes.
Ready to rock?

21:19.458 --> 21:22.291
( moaning )

21:22.291 --> 21:23.750
Is the ambulance here?

21:23.750 --> 21:27.000
Um, I just Wazed it,
and I think it's actually
better if we walk.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.291
I'm not walking, you fucking
baby-murdering cuntmonster!

21:31.291 --> 21:33.333
- Baby, it's okay.
- Damn it, no, it's not okay.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.500
Okay.

21:34.500 --> 21:38.667
Stop fucking touching
my feet, you asshole!

21:38.667 --> 21:42.417
( screams )
Get this fucking thing
off of me!

21:42.417 --> 21:46.041
What?
Don't drop me,
don't drop me.

21:46.041 --> 21:48.542
This is pretty
fucking disappointing.

21:48.542 --> 21:50.708
I know.

21:50.708 --> 21:53.708
No, I mean, like,
madly disappointing.

21:53.708 --> 21:55.291
( sighs )
I know.

21:55.291 --> 21:56.959
But you're the one
who said that it should feel

21:56.959 --> 21:58.542
like we're all just
in someone's garage.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.000
No, that's actually
not what I said.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.959
What I-- if you listened
to what I said, what I said is,

22:01.959 --> 22:05.041
"I like it when it feels
like we're in someone else's
garage," okay?

22:05.041 --> 22:07.166
Don't twist my words around
at your own convenience.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.834
Listen to what
I actually say.

22:08.834 --> 22:11.875
( voice breaking )
Okay, um...

22:11.875 --> 22:13.500
I'm really sorry.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.375
No, no,
please don't cry.

22:15.375 --> 22:19.000
- What's going on?
- Well, uh, Desi is not here

22:19.000 --> 22:21.792
and it seems like
he won't be here.

22:21.792 --> 22:22.750
What?

22:22.750 --> 22:24.417
Listen, let's just hope
he's alive, okay?

22:24.417 --> 22:25.750
Jesus Christ.

22:25.750 --> 22:28.667
Yes, let's always hope
everyone we like is alive.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.750
Marcos:
I'm gonna just go introduce
Violent Ron early.

22:30.750 --> 22:34.333
You can go home,
take a bath, and we'll
check in tomorrow, okay?

22:34.333 --> 22:36.375
What?
No, fuck, no.

22:36.375 --> 22:38.375
No one's going home,
taking a bath.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.708
You're gonna go up there
and you're gonna do this
by yourself.

22:40.708 --> 22:42.417
What?
No, I can't do that.

22:42.417 --> 22:43.792
I don't think she's
much of a solo artist.

22:43.792 --> 22:46.333
- I don't think--
- No, I actually got
my start as a solo artist

22:46.333 --> 22:48.875
and I am perfectly capable
of commanding such a crowd,

22:48.875 --> 22:51.708
but these are
Marnie and Desi songs.

22:51.708 --> 22:54.125
I can't just
do them alone.

22:54.125 --> 22:55.834
Marnie,
listen to me, okay?

22:55.834 --> 22:58.250
And forgive
the following sentence,

22:58.250 --> 22:59.834
but all that matters
right now

22:59.834 --> 23:01.625
is that you keep
the music alive.

23:01.625 --> 23:04.458
That's what Desi
would want.

23:04.458 --> 23:05.792
Look, you want me
to play guitar?

23:05.792 --> 23:07.125
I'm actually
pretty good.

23:08.959 --> 23:11.583
No.

23:11.583 --> 23:14.291
I'm pretty good, too.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.792
Don't worry about it, man.
She cries all the time.

23:19.792 --> 23:21.625

- It was good, yeah.

Really good.

tell you some things
about being alive.

Life, man...

I can't guarantee perfection,
but I can guarantee intrigue.

The idea that I had
an "ambilicord" is--
is insane.

- Umbilical cord.
- Umbilical cord.

You wanna just know that.
It's a word you wanna know.

27:00.834 --> 27:04.166
- Umbilical cord.
- Yeah, good job.

27:04.166 --> 27:06.458
Mimi-Rose and I are over.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.708
Really?

27:12.834 --> 27:15.375
I'm sorry to hear that.
I know you really
cared about her.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.792
Mm, I don't know that I did.
I don't think I really knew her.

27:18.792 --> 27:20.125
Yeah, but isn't that
how we always feel?

27:20.125 --> 27:22.166
Like, when a
relationship ends,
you're like,

27:22.166 --> 27:24.000
"What was that?
Who was that?"

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And then you give it
a few months

27:26.000 --> 27:27.500
and all the good memories
come back

27:27.500 --> 27:29.667
and you can kinda
live with it, I think.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.041
No, I just think
I was confused.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.875
And I think
I made a mistake.

27:37.875 --> 27:40.000
I miss you so badly.

27:43.083 --> 27:45.542
I think I just
got lost in it all.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.542
And I didn't hold on
to the right stuff

27:50.542 --> 27:52.291
and I let my center move.

27:53.917 --> 27:55.542
And I just got lost.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.542
Hannah?

28:03.542 --> 28:05.959
I think you're just
really tired and that
you had a really long day

28:05.959 --> 28:08.875
and that you're gonna
get some sleep and you're
gonna feel all better.

28:10.542 --> 28:12.542
( laughs )

28:14.625 --> 28:16.417
No, I'm serious.

28:18.125 --> 28:19.708
I'm sorry.

28:19.708 --> 28:23.375
Really, I don't know
where the fuck I've been at.

28:23.375 --> 28:27.417
But, you know,
I'm here now.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.834
Yeah, I'm--

28:30.834 --> 28:33.125
I can't do that.

28:34.417 --> 28:36.083
Please?

28:39.542 --> 28:41.583
( voice breaks )
I can't.

28:41.583 --> 28:44.291
Yeah, you can.

28:46.083 --> 28:48.750
I can't.
( sniffles )

28:55.667 --> 28:57.333
Okay.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.250
That's fine.

28:59.250 --> 29:02.583
Okay.
( sniffles )

29:10.125 --> 29:12.417
Loreen on phone:
Honey, it's late.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.667
- Were you sleeping?
- No.

29:14.667 --> 29:19.375
Mommy, I just saw
a baby get born, okay?

29:19.375 --> 29:22.291
Not a whole baby.
First it was just the foot

29:22.291 --> 29:23.834
and then it was
the rest of the baby.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.834
But I did.
I saw a baby.

29:25.834 --> 29:27.917
It was the cutest thing
in the entire world.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.917
She's so small,
but her name is Jessa-Hannah

29:29.917 --> 29:31.708
and she seems
real feisty.

29:31.708 --> 29:35.000
Loreen:
That's nice, honey.
Babies are sweet.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.166
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.667
I'll be fine.

29:39.667 --> 29:43.500
The sad part is
I don't really have
a future.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.083
( Loreen laughs )
You have a future,
though, Hannah.

29:45.083 --> 29:49.708
You're not like me,
giving your life to one man
who ate it all up.

29:49.708 --> 29:52.917
You have time to go out there
and forge something new.

29:52.917 --> 29:55.875
You have time to go out there
and forge 10 new things,

29:55.875 --> 30:00.250
not just reenact,
reimagine

30:00.250 --> 30:05.667
the same old thing
with the same foolish man.

30:06.542 --> 30:08.792
Can I talk to Daddy?

30:08.792 --> 30:12.333
Oh, sure.
She wants to talk to you.
