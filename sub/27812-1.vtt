(GUITAR STRUMMING)

02:06.209 --> 02:08.168
Don't jump in the pool.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.878
The water we put in
next week for the summer.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.809
MALE REPORTER ON TV:...in
South Vietnam ground war.

02:23.893 --> 02:27.688
The U.S. Command reports 148
Americans killed in the war last week,

02:27.772 --> 02:31.817
the lowest weekly figure in six
months. 1,612 Americans were...

02:31.901 --> 02:34.111
FEMALE REPORTER ON TV:...they
barely look like they've been warned.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.863
MALE REPORTER 2 ON TV: There
was exchange of fire south of

02:35.947 --> 02:38.240
the Sea of Galilee and
across the Suez Canal.

02:38.908 --> 02:42.327
These exchanges and raids are
now a daily part of Israeli life,

02:42.412 --> 02:44.621
and the country is
prepared for anything.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.541
NBC news correspondent,
David Burrington, reports.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.211
MALE REPORTER 3: In spite
of all the border turmoil,

02:51.296 --> 02:55.299
Israeli intelligence officers do
not expect all-out war this summer

02:55.383 --> 02:57.801
unless the Arab
nations get reckless.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.678
And that's the
main worry here,

02:59.762 --> 03:02.222
that Arab frustration
will suddenly explode...

03:02.599 --> 03:04.308
(COMMERCIAL PLAYING)

03:05.059 --> 03:06.768
MALE REPORTER 4: In a day
of intensive activity,

03:06.853 --> 03:08.937
Captain Neil Armstrong
and his crew

03:09.022 --> 03:11.148
entered the final
phase of preparations

03:11.232 --> 03:14.151
for the July 16th
launch of Apollo 11.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.361
(BELL DINGING)
NASA officials report

03:16.446 --> 03:19.823
that the third and final day of
launching pad tests proceeded smoothly,

03:19.908 --> 03:21.366
while inside
the training center,

03:21.451 --> 03:25.370
the astronauts performed simulated
moon walks in their space suits.

03:27.957 --> 03:31.877
What? Excuse me. I can't possibly stay.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.713
This establishment isn't
fit for human habitation.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.633
Fine, go. Yes, well, here's your key.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.636
It didn't fit the lock, but
the door was open in any case.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.555
You went into the room?
I did, yes.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.766
And now I must insist
on you returning my $8.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.060
After you already
used the room?

03:48.186 --> 03:50.395
What kind of scam
are you running?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.813
And besides...

03:53.524 --> 03:55.275
Well, this is ridiculous!

03:55.360 --> 03:56.902
The so-called air
conditioner was just

03:56.986 --> 03:58.862
an empty plastic
box in the window.

03:58.947 --> 04:03.033
The room was filthy. Indeed, I
discovered a small hair on the pillow.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.118
There wasn't even
a towel in the bathroom.

04:06.621 --> 04:07.621
ELLIOT: Ma.
What?

04:07.705 --> 04:09.831
Please, we're late already.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.834
My son,
thank God you're here.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.462
This man is threatening me for a refund!

04:25.932 --> 04:28.976
I'm sorry. You're over $5,000
in arrears on the mortgage.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.436
The home office is
breathing down my neck.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.064
Mr. Spiers,
the El Monaco Resort...

04:34.148 --> 04:35.565
It's a resort now?

04:36.734 --> 04:39.736
...and Motel is my
parents' lifeblood.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.862
With the addition
of the swimming pool

04:40.947 --> 04:42.614
and these new town-wide
marketing initiatives...

04:42.699 --> 04:44.116
Initiatives?

04:45.451 --> 04:46.785
As you know, I have been
elected the President

04:46.869 --> 04:47.953
of the Bethel
Chamber of Commerce.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.455
The youngest president
in their history.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.209
We've decided to erect a tourist
information booth, right off 17B.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.544
I have agreed, on behalf
of the El Monaco,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.796
to lease at no cost some
road frontage to the endeavor,

04:57.880 --> 05:01.133
which should coincidentally drive
heavy tourist traffic right to our door.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.385
In addition...
Please, Elliot,

05:03.469 --> 05:05.637
you know I do everything I can to help.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.931
We even bought one
of your paintings.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.310
But don't try to sell me
on those singles weekends

05:11.394 --> 05:13.437
or the culture festival
or whatever other schemes

05:13.521 --> 05:15.397
were supposed to dig
you out last summer.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.525
We've decided to go classical
with the festival this year,

05:18.609 --> 05:21.528
maybe a string quartet, more
contemporary, like Morton Feldman?

05:21.612 --> 05:24.364
Very avant-garde. And we've got
a theater troupe in the barn.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.533
You have a theater
troupe in the barn?

05:27.785 --> 05:32.080
The Earthlight Players.
Vassar graduates, some of them.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.874
They live in the barn?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.044
They do everything
in the barn.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.838
ELLIOT: You haven't
seen the sign? What sign?

05:39.922 --> 05:40.964
The sign in
front of the barn.

05:41.049 --> 05:44.634
Mr. Spiers, my God, please.
We come here, begging,

05:44.719 --> 05:46.345
begging for mercy,
and what do you give us?

05:46.429 --> 05:48.805
This fixation about the barn.
What is it with you and the barn?

05:48.890 --> 05:51.933
I was just... I'm an old woman,
Mr. Spiers. I've suffered.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.896
I walked here all the way
from Minsk, in Russia,

05:55.980 --> 06:00.025
in 20-foot snow drifts,
1,000 miles across Siberia.

06:00.109 --> 06:03.445
I escaped the pogroms,
the Tsar's secret police,

06:03.529 --> 06:06.531
with nothing but cold
potatoes in my pockets.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.034
Mrs. Teichberg, please...
And for what?

06:09.118 --> 06:12.204
For more persecution!
It's because we're Jewish.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.790
I know it, isn't it?
Mrs. Teichberg, please.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.375
This is the Catskills.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.419
Half the summer colonies are
Jewish, they're all our clients.

06:19.504 --> 06:23.799
Until the day they need you,
and then on goes the gas!

06:23.883 --> 06:25.801
ELLIOT: Ma,
calm down, please?

06:26.427 --> 06:29.763
Jackson, just give us
a couple of months.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.350
The summer season's coming up, I
honestly do have some real money

06:33.434 --> 06:35.560
owed me from my interior
design business in the city.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.609
Please?

06:48.991 --> 06:53.036
WOMAN ON PA: Mother-son ballroom class
will start immediately after, at 11:00.

06:53.121 --> 06:57.082
That's kinder-dancing for
the kiddies in 10 minutes.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.959
Dad, you gotta
get Ma to lay off

06:59.043 --> 07:01.878
the Nazi stuff and
let me handle this.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.840
You think I can tell
your mother what to do?

07:06.050 --> 07:09.386
I gotta get back to the city.
I'll see you Friday.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.721
We'll get the money.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.183
Let them take
this miserable dump.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.561
I'll die in peace,
in Florida.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.990
Mr. Tiber.
George.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.285
I admitted your sister
some time ago. Thanks.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.745
And some gentlemen
from the moving company.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.080
Oh, yeah.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.960
There you are.
Hi, Sis.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.049
How did it go
at the bank?

07:49.385 --> 07:53.847
How do you think it went? Till
the end of the summer, that's it.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.183
What about the money
those mobsters owe you

07:56.267 --> 07:58.059
for that nightclub
you designed?

08:00.062 --> 08:03.315
They have a surprisingly strict
policy about paying designers.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.774
They don't.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.944
(SIGHS) You want some more paintings?

08:08.029 --> 08:11.323
No, I already have 10 of them.
And you know Joe hates them.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.035
Of course you're broke,

08:15.119 --> 08:18.330
after all the money you've sunk
into that hellhole of theirs.

08:18.414 --> 08:22.000
And I bet Ma's never even
said a word of thanks, has she?

08:22.543 --> 08:25.295
No, but I can sense it.

08:26.422 --> 08:27.923
The special way she
sometimes looks at me

08:28.007 --> 08:30.425
with just her left eye,
you know.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.511
Elliot. Now is your time

08:33.596 --> 08:35.679
to go to California
like you've always wanted,

08:35.765 --> 08:40.727
to paint and design. Be free, stop
throwing your life away up there.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.981
I can't give up on them now. Why not?

08:45.566 --> 08:47.901
I'm the one they
still want around.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.362
I guess that means they
love me more than you.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.824
That must be a great
consolation to you.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.341
Dad, that's bleach
for laundry.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.302
It kills the germs.
What's the difference?

09:20.309 --> 09:23.436
Elli? What? What are you
doing with those sheets?

09:23.521 --> 09:26.898
They're dirty.
Let me see. Nothing.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.234
Those two, they didn't do nothing
in there. Shake them, put them back.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.486
But, Ma...
Electricity, detergent,

09:31.571 --> 09:33.655
who's paying
for all that?

09:38.119 --> 09:41.621
And you, theater girl,
get back in the barn!

09:43.833 --> 09:45.250
All of you!

09:46.002 --> 09:47.544
Lazy people.

09:50.339 --> 09:54.009
Let's call to order.
Come on, everyone.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.681
Last meeting, we all said we'd each
bring some new ideas to the table.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.438
Well, okay.

10:07.857 --> 10:11.151
We got a lot of dairy farms
around here, right?

10:11.819 --> 10:15.280
And a fair number of bulls.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.615
Okay, you've all
heard of the running

10:16.699 --> 10:19.075
of the bulls in
that town in Spain,

10:19.160 --> 10:21.453
Pampoona.
Pamplona.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.747
Well, no one's doing
one in the Catskills.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.124
Seems to be a big
draw over there.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.211
It would be very amusing
to see all those Jews

10:30.296 --> 10:32.172
from Levitsky's
summer colony,

10:32.256 --> 10:35.967
you know, the ones with the
black top hats and the curls,

10:36.052 --> 10:39.471
running for their lives
chased by our local livestock.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.849
Wouldn't that be
a wonderful sight!

10:43.225 --> 10:44.434
(ANNIE CHUCKLES)

10:45.144 --> 10:46.645
We're writing it all down.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.359
Any other ideas?
What about the monorail?

10:52.443 --> 10:54.861
Marge, you can't bring
that up in every meeting.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.614
I've written
to the Governor,

10:57.698 --> 11:00.116
but I think a letter from
the entire Chamber of Commerce

11:00.201 --> 11:02.202
would be much
more effective.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.330
A monorail linking downtown
New York to White Lake

11:05.414 --> 11:08.124
would be a tremendous spur
to the local economy.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.835
Jesus. Look, people, I said I
would come back to these meetings

11:10.920 --> 11:13.838
if you could stay out of
cuckoo land, just once.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.300
We have some serious local
issues, serious business to do.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.843
Such as?

11:18.969 --> 11:20.428
For starters,

11:20.513 --> 11:21.971
I need a permit
for the town landing

11:22.056 --> 11:24.557
for a fish-toss
tournament next month.

11:24.642 --> 11:28.520
I knew it. I knew it. You're just
back here for your own purposes.

11:28.604 --> 11:32.565
Now, come on, Marge. All right,
let's see the application.

11:32.942 --> 11:33.942
I got it here.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.284
Yeah, that's all
in order. $1.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.664
Here you go.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.459
And I've got my
application for our annual

11:51.544 --> 11:53.962
El Monaco summer
music and art event,

11:54.046 --> 11:55.505
which will also inaugurate
the first season

11:55.589 --> 11:57.465
of the tourist
information kiosk.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.343
Annie, if your grandson and his
friends want to play again this year,

12:00.428 --> 12:01.970
tell them to
give me a call.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.264
Okay.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.475
Do I hear a motion to
approve these permits?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.854
I so move.
Okay. Seconded?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.315
Seconded?

12:16.026 --> 12:18.820
Oh, for crying
out loud, seconded.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.167
Good night.
Good night.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.296
Good night, Annie.
Night, Elliot.

12:37.798 --> 12:38.798
MAN: See you, Elliot.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.341
Bye, everyone.
CAROL: Night, Elliot.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.303
Good night, Carol. Fuck! Fuck!
Take him down, motherfuckers!

12:43.387 --> 12:46.806
Jesus! DAN: Billy, get back in the car.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.017
What?
Back in the car.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.855
Hey, Billy, you're back.
That's great.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.316
Yeah.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.862
Staying with big brother Dan
and his beautiful wife Carol here

13:00.946 --> 13:02.113
till I get my own pad.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.531
Yeah, 'cause
little brother Billy

13:03.616 --> 13:05.283
made a tiny little
pit stop in Bangkok

13:05.367 --> 13:07.452
and blew all his Army pay.
Didn't he, Billy?

13:10.414 --> 13:14.834
Bangkok, man.
Fucking Bangkok.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.378
Come on, we gotta go.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.425
Great seeing you
back home, Billy.

13:22.676 --> 13:23.968
(ENGINE STARTS)

13:44.240 --> 13:45.865
Hey, Elliot.
Dave.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.033
The usual?

13:47.117 --> 13:48.660
Extra bacon, please.
You got it.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.161
Hey, Elliot.
Max.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.205
I hear you've moved
up here permanently.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.290
Just helping Mom and
Dad for the season.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.044
Well, I hope you have
another one of your festivals.

13:58.128 --> 14:01.297
Miriam and I just love listening
to your records out on that lawn.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.175
Sure, Max. This year, I'm going
to try to get a live quartet.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.177
BOB: Looks like you're
gonna have some competition.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.888
What, there's a recall vote
down at the Chamber of Commerce?

14:09.598 --> 14:10.682
This says here
that Wallkill's

14:10.766 --> 14:12.684
gonna have
a music festival, too.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.310
Some hippie thing
got thrown out of Woodstock

14:14.395 --> 14:16.771
so they've set
themselves up in Wallkill.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.316
Wow, Janis Joplin.

14:20.401 --> 14:23.194
Guess that beats playing a
bunch of records on a lawn.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.489

into some kind of antiwar riot.

you could detonate

the ashes down, you know,

sit on that.

the local cows. Far out.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.340

must be some healthy grass.

in big fields,

down the road from us.

I've always been a big supporter
of Elliot, here in Bethel,

and I always enjoy his
music festival every summer.

29:40.528 --> 29:45.157

I donate the yogurt and the milk.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.619
It's fate.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.038
It's beautiful.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.918
Although some of the local
young people, the music they play

29:56.002 --> 29:59.880
can be a little trying, if
you know what I mean, honestly.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.591
Yeah, but it's the effort
that counts, isn't it, Miriam?

30:02.675 --> 30:04.551
And they do
enjoy themselves.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.929

in music, Mr. Yasgur.

something of an imposition,

30:19.859 --> 30:20.984
but we're more than
willing to do anything...

30:21.069 --> 30:24.112
You say you want to
use these fields here?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.448
Then you'll be needing the
land beside the barns as well,

30:26.574 --> 30:29.076
I'm guessing,
for access to the roads.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.744
And parking.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.872
Probably best
across 17B.

30:33.957 --> 30:37.835
I own the piece down the road,
but there are a couple of lots.

30:38.795 --> 30:42.297
You'll probably want to
avoid dealing with the Browns.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.926
And you'll clean up after
yourselves, I'm hoping.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.344
Of course.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.556
Well,

30:53.184 --> 30:55.310
would $5,000
do it for you?

30:58.690 --> 30:59.898
Five?

30:59.983 --> 31:01.859
But you'll have to tidy up,
and you'll have to pay

31:01.943 --> 31:04.361
for any damaged crops,
of course.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.954
Sure, Max.
That sounds fine.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.125
Good. Wonderful.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.629
Well, why don't you all come into
the house for some chocolate milk?

31:24.424 --> 31:25.465
Far out.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.419
You know, we're gonna need
a place for people to crash

32:02.503 --> 32:04.004
while we prepare
the festival.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.589
Your place looks
pretty cool.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.675
How many vacant rooms do you
have for the next couple of weeks?

32:10.053 --> 32:12.220
Well, it depends on
how you define room.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.972
You know, how many
people can crash with you.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.432
What do you guys charge?

32:15.516 --> 32:19.436
Let's see. It's $8 a night,
but that can be for doubles,

32:19.520 --> 32:21.480
and we give a weekly
discount, of course.

32:21.564 --> 32:25.692
Plus the cabins, you can
get cots, so four people,

32:25.777 --> 32:27.235
about 150, I'd say.

32:27.362 --> 32:30.113
You can get about 200 people.
Hey, man, let's make it easy.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.325
Why don't we just buy the
El Monaco out for the season?

32:33.409 --> 32:35.786
Just figure out the costs, write
it down, and we'll take a look.

32:35.870 --> 32:36.954
And if we don't
use all the rooms,

32:37.038 --> 32:38.246
you can rent out
the free ones.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.998
We need to keep some cleanup
crews around afterwards.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.375
And if you've got
some bigger spaces,

32:41.459 --> 32:42.918
for offices,
that kind of thing.

32:43.002 --> 32:45.295
We need to put in some phones and
have some space to park vehicles.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.047
You know where we're going?
Mmm-hmm.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.219
There you go.
That's the...

32:53.262 --> 32:56.348
Looks like we can work
with this, Elli. Cool.

32:56.975 --> 33:01.061
You know, I was thinking, I've got
that theater troupe in the barn.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.813
A theater troupe
in the barn?

33:02.897 --> 33:06.650
Yeah, the Earthlight Players.
It's okay if they stay, right?

33:08.069 --> 33:10.237
Maybe you guys could find some
work for them or something.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.572
They could really
use the pay.

33:13.199 --> 33:16.660
They're all hired, man. Not
a problem. Great. Thanks.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.999
And I hope you don't mind,
but we like to pay cash

33:24.585 --> 33:25.961
in advance.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.889
And not only that, he made me a local
community liaison for the festival,

33:37.974 --> 33:40.559
and we're going to be the
exclusive local ticket agency, too.

33:40.643 --> 33:44.354
They think at least 5,000 people
are gonna buy tickets, or more.

33:45.231 --> 33:48.275
Five thousand coming
here to White Lake?

33:49.485 --> 33:51.361
Elli, you're an idiot.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.280
Twenty people, thirty,
okay, for a weekend.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.365
But 1,000, 5,000?
They'll steal everything.

33:55.491 --> 33:57.200
Ma... We'll be sued in
court by the neighbors.

33:57.285 --> 34:01.204
What kind of meshuga, hairy, barefoot
person comes here in a heliocoptic

34:01.289 --> 34:03.707
that we should lay our good white
sheets on the grass and ruin them,

34:03.791 --> 34:06.126
and then plot and
revolutionize to take our hotel.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.544
Ma, he pays cash.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.670
Everyone pays cash here,
you shnook!

34:09.755 --> 34:12.257
No, Ma, really.
Open it.

34:13.634 --> 34:14.842
Open it.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.975
That's $5,000 for the rent, and another
$5,000 for my services as liaison.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.726
Plus, think of the money we're
gonna make off of commissions

34:23.853 --> 34:25.603
(SHUSHES) From the
ticket sales! And also...

MAX: Elliot?
Hey, Max.

34:35.281 --> 34:39.034
Hi. Well, the phone hasn't
stopped ringing since you left.

34:39.118 --> 34:40.744
And they're saying...
I know, wow.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.330
...thousands of people might
be coming to this thing. Yeah.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.248
Well, you know,
that's gonna cost

34:45.333 --> 34:47.083
quite a bit to put
things back in order,

34:47.168 --> 34:50.879
and to get the cows situated and
so forth. I can understand, sure.

34:50.963 --> 34:52.839
Now, Elliot,
you know I don't wish

34:52.924 --> 34:54.757
to mess up your festival.
You know that.

34:54.842 --> 34:58.220
'Cause I think what was done to
those young people in Wallkill

34:58.304 --> 35:01.932
was just plain wrong. But
I've been talking with Miriam,

35:02.016 --> 35:05.060
and we think if you could just
go back and tell those people...

35:05.144 --> 35:08.438
How much? Seventy-five
thousand. Not a penny less.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.442
Okay, I'll let them know.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.363
Okay, good. Bye-bye.

35:19.909 --> 35:20.992
What?

35:21.077 --> 35:24.871
Don't spend any of that money.
That was Max. The deal's off.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.624
What? Impossible!

35:27.750 --> 35:30.418
Ma. Ma. Ma.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.713
Elli, don't try to stop her.
She can't get far.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.342
And I read in the papers,
you've already sold

35:37.426 --> 35:40.387
thousands of tickets,
and that's a lot.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.805
And so you'll be
needing to use,

35:41.889 --> 35:44.933
practically, my whole place
here, not just the alfalfa fields.

35:45.017 --> 35:47.727
Now, wait a second.
I mean, I could...

35:48.855 --> 35:52.649
I mean, I could buy a farm for the
kind of money you're asking for.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.317
I could buy five farms.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.278
From what I read in
the papers, Mr. Roberts,

35:56.362 --> 35:58.655
you've already spent a
million dollars in Wallkill,

35:58.739 --> 36:01.825
and you've only got until
the 15th until your festival.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.286
Now, I'm sure a wealthy
young man such as yourself

36:04.370 --> 36:06.705
could, indeed,
buy a lot of farms.

36:06.789 --> 36:09.040
But that's neither here nor
there. All I'm saying is...

36:09.125 --> 36:12.919
Yeah, all you're saying is that
you've got us over a barrel.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.839
Well, if I didn't, you wouldn't
be on your second carton

36:15.923 --> 36:18.425
of chocolate milk
now, would you?

36:18.843 --> 36:22.137
But I tell you this, fellas, when
you make a deal with me, it's a deal.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.639
Okay? So long as you promise
to put things back in order,

36:24.724 --> 36:26.725
I'll stand by you 100%.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.018
These people
are my neighbors,

36:28.102 --> 36:29.686
and I know how
to deal with them.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.981
I won't let them run you off
like they did in Wallkill,

36:33.065 --> 36:36.443
'cause this is my land,
and let's just see them try.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.072
Wow, Max, that is very
cool. And you're right.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.574
We're going to
have a lot of people

36:42.658 --> 36:44.034
come here and
enjoy your place.

36:44.118 --> 36:48.038
Michael, if I may, I wouldn't
describe $75,000 as cool.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.706
$5,000 is cool.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.958
Hey, it's your bread, guys.

36:52.043 --> 36:55.170
I'm just trying to put you
together here with Max's vision.

36:56.964 --> 37:01.509
Right. Look, Max, if we were
willing to consider doing this,

37:01.594 --> 37:03.386
you're really gonna have to
let us make it work.

37:03.471 --> 37:07.390
Mike, listen, really, if this
doesn't shake out with Max...

37:07.475 --> 37:09.392
I'm sure we're
gonna be fine.

37:09.477 --> 37:12.938
John and Joel and Max, they're
all gonna come together.

37:13.814 --> 37:14.981
I can feel it.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.276
Good vibes.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.613
MAX: He won't let them near
it. Smithson? Who's Smithson?

37:21.739 --> 37:24.241
MAX: I don't own the property down
there. You don't own the property?

37:24.325 --> 37:26.409
MAX: I own this
and I own that,

37:26.494 --> 37:30.038
which reminds me, I'm sure you'll
be willing to put up a bond,

37:30.122 --> 37:34.376
just in case there's damage.
I was thinking $75,000.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.711
JOEL: Fuck!
A $75,000 bond, too?

37:38.464 --> 37:41.424
Can I ask you a question? Please.

37:41.509 --> 37:45.553
Is Mike for real?
I mean, he's so relaxed.

37:46.472 --> 37:51.101
Michael, yeah,
he's totally real,

37:52.853 --> 37:54.980
so long as
the cash is real.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.607
And the cash is real so long
as John and Joel are real.

37:57.692 --> 38:01.069
And I guess John and Joel
are gonna stay real because,

38:01.153 --> 38:05.365
between us, they've already
sold 100,000 tickets.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.246
And who wants 100,000 freaks
coming after them for refunds?

38:13.582 --> 38:15.292
MAN: So Mikey is trying
to sell those six acres.

38:15.376 --> 38:17.252

Yeah.

think we're out of the usual.

Out of the usual?
Wow, that's unusual.

44:37.758 --> 44:40.468
WOMAN: I don't know. White Lake
sounds better than Wallkill.

44:40.552 --> 44:42.345
Don't ask me why
they call it Woodstock.

44:42.429 --> 44:44.389
Everyone's gonna drive
to the fucking real Woodstock

44:44.473 --> 44:46.182
and be really bummed
when they get there.

44:46.266 --> 44:49.644
DOT's letting us put signage
up. Just not on the Thruway yet.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.229
But we're working on it.
We're gonna want to run lines

44:51.313 --> 44:52.355
all the way
back to the fence.

44:52.439 --> 44:53.690
MAN: Can you trench here?

44:53.774 --> 44:56.442
No, man. Everything,
water pipes, juice,

44:56.527 --> 44:58.069
all the cables
gotta run aboveground.

44:58.153 --> 45:00.279
I got the specs from
Hanley, for the speakers.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.531
(CHUCKLES)
That's a lot of juice.

45:01.615 --> 45:04.033
When Hendrix lights up, there won't
be a bird left in Sullivan County.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.452
Hey, I spoke to Wavy Gravy
and the Hog Farmers.

45:06.537 --> 45:07.537
Wavy?
Yeah.

45:07.621 --> 45:11.290
His real name's Hugh. He's
got 80 freaks, the Hog Farmers.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.626
They've got a commune
in the desert.

45:13.794 --> 45:16.045
They drop more acid
than Timothy Leary.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.423
There's 80 of them coming
in on a jumbo jet next week.

45:18.507 --> 45:21.718
Hey, man, I can't find
the keys to my room.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.219
Ask my mom.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.055
Hey, how's your room?
Fine, man.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.516
Trip tents? Yeah, where
the kids can come down...

45:28.642 --> 45:31.227
From the trip. WOMAN: Wait,
wait. What have you got here?

45:31.812 --> 45:32.812
No, no.
Don't put it down there.

45:32.896 --> 45:35.064
He and his people are willing
to work with you on security.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.192
You know, they really like your
non-confrontational approach.

45:38.277 --> 45:41.320
You know, they wanna
call it a "Please Force."

45:41.739 --> 45:44.031
Not sure how Fabbri's
going to like that moniker.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.783
We're still going
to need real police.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.996
Hey, Mike,
do you have a second?

45:50.122 --> 45:51.831
I'm just feeling
a little anxious.

45:51.915 --> 45:53.374
Did Tisha tell you about
these code violations?

45:53.459 --> 45:54.792
Hey, Elliot. Just the
man I wanted to see.

45:54.877 --> 45:56.210
You know,
I'm getting the feeling

45:56.295 --> 45:57.587
that we're really
going to be able to use

45:57.671 --> 45:58.880
your community
relations skills.

45:58.964 --> 45:59.922
My what skills?

46:00.007 --> 46:01.466
Because, Elli, the rumors
are already swirling,

46:01.550 --> 46:03.968
and we need to put a local
face on the reality here.

46:04.052 --> 46:06.429
And you, Elli,
are a local face.

46:06.513 --> 46:08.765
I'm a local face, yes,
but about these violations.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.850
There's not a hotel around for
miles that could pass inspection.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.686
Those inspector dudes?
Don't worry about that, Elli.

46:13.812 --> 46:17.106
Tisha told me all about those
guys. Just give us the papers.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.692
We've got some
heavy lawyers. Right?

46:21.862 --> 46:23.154
Heavy lawyers. Right.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.864
Because right now,
Elli, I need you to focus

46:24.948 --> 46:26.532
on the positive message
that we're sending.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.951
You know, rapping with
the local townspeople,

46:29.036 --> 46:31.454
finding some time
with some of the papers here.

46:31.538 --> 46:33.998
Wait, you mean like
a press conference?

46:34.082 --> 46:39.170
A press conference. Yeah.
Radical idea, Elli. I love it.

46:39.254 --> 46:41.798
No, actually, you don't.
Me and public speaking,

46:41.882 --> 46:44.050
I can guarantee you,
not one of my strong suits.

46:44.134 --> 46:45.259
I'm speaking from
experience here.

46:45.344 --> 46:47.970
Hey, Michael. Hey. I
want you to meet somebody.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.472
Let me introduce
you to Reverend Don.

46:49.556 --> 46:51.140
He's helping with
our community outreach

46:51.225 --> 46:52.308
and he'd love it if
you could help him

46:52.392 --> 46:54.977
get to know the locals. Hi.
It's really great to meet you.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.229
I don't know how
much Michael's told you,

46:56.396 --> 46:57.563
but we're thinking
of putting on

46:57.648 --> 46:59.482
a little free concert
for the local people here,

46:59.566 --> 47:01.275
and we thought it
would be a great idea to

47:01.360 --> 47:02.860
include a scene from
your theater company.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.862
Do you think
they'd be open to it?

47:04.947 --> 47:08.991
Yeah, they'd love that. But
you said it's for the locals?

47:09.576 --> 47:12.078
Because the play's
very contemporary. Cool.

47:12.162 --> 47:14.914
Hey, hey, you guys,
the phones are alive.

47:18.085 --> 47:19.252
Mike.

47:22.381 --> 47:24.382
Hey, your dad wants you.

47:44.945 --> 47:47.613
I'll get some paint, but they're
just going to do it again.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.825
They set foot here again,
I break their heads.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.743
Dad, let me call...

47:52.828 --> 47:56.789
Call who? That little
putz in the green shirt,

47:56.874 --> 47:58.624
he's the son of
that state trooper.

47:59.459 --> 48:02.295
I could boil him and his
putz of a father in tar.

48:02.379 --> 48:06.048
Just, Dad, let's just get this
painted before Mom sees it.

48:06.133 --> 48:08.801
Then you can start
warming up the tar.

48:26.695 --> 48:27.862
Thanks.

48:27.988 --> 48:30.031
Put some more of
those in the cooler.

48:30.115 --> 48:32.158
Dad, this is all we got.

48:32.284 --> 48:33.409
You didn't order more?

48:33.493 --> 48:35.828
I did. And I called Karpen's,
too, for the kitchen.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.538
I asked them all to
bring 10 times our usual.

48:37.623 --> 48:38.706
Well, when they
come tomorrow,

48:38.790 --> 48:40.833
you tell them to
bring 20 times more.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.793
No, 30 times.

48:42.878 --> 48:45.296
Where are we
going to put it all?

48:45.839 --> 48:49.050
These people, they eat
and drink like animals,

48:50.218 --> 48:52.887
and there's more of
them every minute.

48:54.848 --> 48:58.517
It doesn't matter where we
put it. It'll be gone in a day.

49:00.187 --> 49:02.063

believe she's gone.

Actually, I can believe
it. I met her once.

going to do their business?

56:43.608 --> 56:47.069
I married young, the night
before I shipped out for Korea.

56:47.195 --> 56:49.655
You were in Korea? Semper
fi, you little prick.

56:49.739 --> 56:51.490
Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps.

56:52.283 --> 56:53.826
No kidding.
Yeah.

56:53.910 --> 56:54.910
Wow.

56:56.871 --> 57:01.750
That's me with the cigar. The
other one was the love of my life.

57:02.961 --> 57:04.420
Killed. Sniper.

57:05.171 --> 57:07.673
I went out on patrol, found
the Chinese pissant who did it,

57:07.757 --> 57:10.050
and broke his neck with
my own hands. Jesus.

57:10.135 --> 57:11.427
Actually, I made
that last part up.

57:11.511 --> 57:13.262
But I would have if I'd gotten
a hold of the son of a bitch,

57:13.346 --> 57:15.347
and I'd do it today
if I found him.

57:17.559 --> 57:21.311
Vilma, you're hired.
Thank you.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.939
Welcome aboard.
You won't regret it.

57:25.108 --> 57:29.361
Do you need some kind of
uniform? I've got uniforms, baby.

57:37.704 --> 57:38.704
Wow.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.042
(HORSE NICKERING)

57:46.337 --> 57:49.882
Hey, Elliot.
She's a beautiful ride.

57:51.509 --> 57:53.385
Great way to
commute to Max's.

57:55.388 --> 57:58.807
That's a nice suit. It's
for the press. Conference.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.392
Sure.

58:01.561 --> 58:04.438
You okay?
A little nervous.

58:04.522 --> 58:05.856
Got just the thing.

58:09.903 --> 58:12.863
You know, actually, I'm
feeling a little nauseous.

58:12.989 --> 58:15.908
Hey, grass is a perfect
cure for nausea.

58:17.035 --> 58:18.660
Really?
Seriously.

58:19.579 --> 58:20.579
Well...

58:23.416 --> 58:25.083
Yeah.

58:25.793 --> 58:28.253
It's good shit.
Very good shit.

58:32.217 --> 58:34.676
...and in these next few days
before the concert,

58:34.761 --> 58:36.845
we'll also provide
daily briefings

58:36.930 --> 58:39.014
and we're all here to
provide any follow up.

58:39.098 --> 58:42.893
But without further delay,
here is Mr. Elliot Tiber,

58:42.977 --> 58:44.478
the proprietor of
the El Monaco,

58:44.562 --> 58:46.688
President of the Bethel
Chamber of Commerce,

58:46.773 --> 58:50.609
and a community liaison for
Woodstock Ventures. Mr. Tiber.

58:55.990 --> 58:57.908
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen of the press.

58:57.992 --> 59:00.827
Do you have a legal permit
for the concert in White Lake?

59:03.122 --> 59:07.668
There will be a music and arts festival
held here on August 15th, 16th, and 17th,

59:07.752 --> 59:10.212
part of my ongoing yearly
music and arts festivals

59:10.296 --> 59:14.091
that have made White Lake the truly
international cultural center that it is.

59:14.175 --> 59:16.134
As evidenced by the fact that
you wonderful ladies and gentlemen

59:16.219 --> 59:18.345
of the press are
here to report on it.

59:18.429 --> 59:20.389
I have been proud to be the
artistic director of the festival

59:20.473 --> 59:22.307
in its prior incarnations,
and I hope that...

59:22.392 --> 59:25.018
Yes, but do you have a
legal permit for the concert?

59:26.813 --> 59:28.146
(RAIN PATTERING)

59:28.231 --> 59:29.231
Of course.

59:30.024 --> 59:32.276
Need I remind you,
I am the President.

59:32.360 --> 59:35.737
I am the President of the
Bethel Chamber of Commerce.

59:35.822 --> 59:39.658
Would a leading civic leader
such as myself break his own laws?

59:39.742 --> 59:41.368
That doesn't make sense.

59:41.452 --> 59:43.829
Do you realize that the
police are now estimating

59:43.913 --> 59:48.041
that perhaps as many as 100,000
people will attend the concert?

59:48.126 --> 59:51.503
What will your people here in
White Lake think of 100,000 hippies

59:51.588 --> 59:53.589
and what they
will do to the town?

59:55.800 --> 59:58.510
My people?
You say my people.

59:59.387 --> 01:00:02.556
Native White Lakians
cannot be considered people,

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:06.351
you know,
mine or anyone else's.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:12.441
Can you tell us something
about these free programs

01:00:12.525 --> 01:00:14.735
for the local community
happening this week?

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:17.863
Will there be a cap on
the number of tickets sold,

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:21.700
and how will you deal with
people showing up without tickets?

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:27.122
You are asking
about freedom.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:29.750
The very essence
of the enterprise,

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:33.253
of all enterprise,
especially free enterprise.

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:37.841
And freedom
could be considered,

01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:42.929
and is often considered, you know, to
be just another word for being free.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:49.061
Therefore, there will be no train to
freedom. Train has already left the station.

01:00:51.939 --> 01:00:56.234
How can the music be free when the
people of White Lake are enchained?

01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:57.944
Huh?

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:01.031
If one song is not free,
then all songs are not free.

01:01:01.115 --> 01:01:05.327
That is why we are going to
free all the songs in White Lake.

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:08.205

the hell is going on here?

You stood strong up there.

That freedom rap, yeah.
That was heavy.

We've got an artist here.

He's been out here two
hours already. Won't budge.

Come here. Just wait.

Your dad says
you're a painter.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.074
When did he say that?

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:13.580
I had him give me a tour of the property,
you know, getting a lay of the land.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:18.543
He talked a lot about you,
about Brooklyn.

01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:26.259
He showed me some of his favorite
places, the oaks down by the lake.

01:03:27.887 --> 01:03:29.054
Nice.

ELLIOT: Wait.

01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:34.476
Are you sure that was my dad?
Maybe it was somebody else's?

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:40.315
I mean, he doesn't have any
favorite places here, he hates it.

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:41.691
He doesn't talk.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:46.863
I didn't say it was therapy or
anything, you know. It was just chatting.

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:49.574

His mind must be going.

Don't worry, Elliot.
I'll keep an eye on him.

If he starts to laugh or smile
or anything suspicious like that,

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.254
I'll let you know.

to put all the sunflower seeds.

did they buy?

Hey, Mike.
Elli, you made it.

01:52:16.855 --> 01:52:20.733
Yeah, finally.
It's amazing.

01:52:21.693 --> 01:52:23.694
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:52:30.618 --> 01:52:32.202
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

01:52:32.287 --> 01:52:36.665
Hey, thanks for calling and welcoming
us to your international resort, man.

01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:40.377
The whole world came, and now
everyone's pulling together.

01:52:41.755 --> 01:52:45.007
Yeah. It's all just like
you said, Mike, isn't it?

01:52:47.719 --> 01:52:51.138
Yeah, three days
of peace and music.

01:52:55.351 --> 01:52:56.852
So what happens now?

01:52:58.521 --> 01:52:59.938
Man, who knows?

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:03.859
Everybody's gotta chase
the money now, right?

01:53:03.943 --> 01:53:04.943
Yeah.

01:53:05.028 --> 01:53:08.614
We're all probably gonna sue
each other, but that's cool.

01:53:09.574 --> 01:53:11.366
We'll figure it out.

01:53:13.745 --> 01:53:15.329
What about you?

01:53:15.997 --> 01:53:19.708
I don't know.
I put all my stuff in my car.

01:53:20.835 --> 01:53:24.171
Hey, that's a sign.

01:53:31.596 --> 01:53:35.474
If your car moves, come look me up.
I'm going to San Francisco.

01:53:35.558 --> 01:53:37.142
Me and Chip
and some of the guys,

01:53:37.227 --> 01:53:40.270
we're gonna help out
with a truly free concert.

01:53:40.563 --> 01:53:42.898
It's gonna be even more
beautiful than this one.

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:44.483
Wow.
Yeah.

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:48.153
The Rolling Stones.

01:53:48.238 --> 01:53:49.238
Rolling Stones?

01:53:49.989 --> 01:53:52.491
Yeah, Stones.

01:53:56.037 --> 01:53:57.412
Beautiful.

01:53:58.957 --> 01:54:00.207
(URGING HORSE)

01:54:05.922 --> 01:54:12.177
Beautiful.
