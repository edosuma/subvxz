00:01.001 --> 00:03.461
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:06.089
He grabbed me,
and stuffed money down my shirt.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.133
And then he said he was a cop.

00:08.508 --> 00:12.220
You nail some drugged-out,
two-buck mattress buster,

00:12.303 --> 00:14.889
and all of a sudden
they got you under a microscope.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.809
I've just come back from the D.A.'s office
about Susan Downey.

00:17.892 --> 00:19.436
They're looking to plea-bargain.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.605
Well, I told your Mr. Ramsey no deal.
We fight all the way.

00:23.023 --> 00:27.819
I have some coconut rum lotion
I'm dying to try out.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.367
There are men in my life who'd kill
to have what you had.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.745
I only wish it'd been enough for me.
It wasn't.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.246
Oh, I'd like you to meet Fay Furillo.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.414
-How do you do, Fay?
-Hello.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.124
-You're the captain's missus?
-Former.

00:41.541 --> 00:45.670
Oh, well, in that case, Fay, uh,
do you like contact sports?

00:45.754 --> 00:47.338
Tonight we were at dinner, and, uh--

00:48.131 --> 00:50.592
The fact is,
I have been spending time with...

00:51.426 --> 00:52.260
this other woman.

00:52.343 --> 00:55.555
We stand an excellent chance if we can get
Virgil into that meeting with a wire.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.224
Captain, these Black Arrow guys
play for keeps.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.309
They waste people.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.393
(gun cocks)

01:03.521 --> 01:04.814
Afraid to die, Virgil?

01:04.898 --> 01:07.067
They found Virgil Brooks.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.068
What do you mean "found"?

01:08.443 --> 01:11.362
Shot in the head. Execution style.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.326
(chattering)

01:16.409 --> 01:21.539
Having previously gone on record
as opposing these unauthorized and, uh,

01:21.915 --> 01:24.918
simian departures from precinct protocol,

01:25.418 --> 01:27.545
I nevertheless feel compelled
to acknowledge

01:27.629 --> 01:32.592
the aforementioned creature's appearance
in municipal court yesterday

01:32.675 --> 01:34.969
as material witness for the prosecution.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.972
Said appearance resulting
in his owner's conviction on 16 charges

01:38.056 --> 01:41.351
of conspiracy, purse-snatching
and receiving stolen property.

01:41.434 --> 01:44.312
(cheering)

01:44.395 --> 01:46.731
Of which, Baby,

01:46.815 --> 01:48.942
the officers of this precinct

01:49.025 --> 01:54.823
have, uh, requested me to bestow upon you
this official garment

01:55.406 --> 01:58.368
as a token of their esteem.

01:58.701 --> 02:02.122
(cheering)

02:03.540 --> 02:05.542
Baby, stand up. Stand up.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.504
(wolf whistles)

02:09.587 --> 02:12.465
An appropriate domicile
has been found for Baby

02:12.549 --> 02:15.677
at, uh, Syd's Jungle Safari Park.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.765
That's 20 miles out Route 16
in the township of Brighton.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.601
So, uh, don't be strangers.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.353
Looks like you're dressing
your little brother

02:25.436 --> 02:27.105
to go to church or something, Belker.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.398
MAN: All right.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.275
(all cheering and applauding)

02:33.570 --> 02:35.738
RENKO: You wanna take my partner
to the jungle park?

02:36.197 --> 02:40.451
All right, come on, come on.
Eyes front. Eyes front.

02:40.535 --> 02:46.541
Item 12, regarding the inordinate amount
of intramural wages being laid

02:46.624 --> 02:50.587
on the precinct's small arms
qualifications to be held this afternoon.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.923
This is serious exercises
we're speaking of, people.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.551
Not some sort of ballistic bowling
for dollars.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.012
Let us, therefore,
at the very least, endeavor to keep

02:59.095 --> 03:02.182
the spreadsheets off the upstairs
assignment board, shall we?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.978
Item 13: Operation Jezebel.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.273
All parties assigned to this morning's
hooker sweep of Allen Street

03:10.356 --> 03:14.444
should report immediately after roll call
to Lieutenant Hunter

03:14.527 --> 03:16.613
at the south end
of the precinct parking area.

03:17.071 --> 03:20.325
For those of you who may have been under
your blow-dryers when this memo went out,

03:20.408 --> 03:24.204
that means Hill, Renko, Coffey, Bates,

03:24.287 --> 03:27.749
Coley, Lyle, Ellis, Shaw, Sirwell.

03:28.583 --> 03:33.922
As you all have probably heard,
we lost a man last night.

03:34.505 --> 03:37.050
Detective First Class
Virgil Patterson Brooks.

03:37.508 --> 03:40.553
I realize that Officer Brooks was unknown
to the majority of you,

03:40.637 --> 03:44.807
due to the undercover nature of his work
these past nine months,

03:44.891 --> 03:49.437
but you can take it from me,
he was one of our best.

03:52.148 --> 03:55.693
Now, we'll arrange for his body
to be flown back to his family in Memphis

03:55.777 --> 03:56.986
for burial this Friday.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.865
Now, those of you wishing
to send condolences

04:01.741 --> 04:04.494
will find the address posted
on the upstairs board.

04:05.995 --> 04:09.457
Okay, let's roll. And for God's sake,

04:10.166 --> 04:11.876
be careful out there.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.393
WOMAN (on radio):<i> Dispatch.</i>
<i>We have a 9-11.</i>

04:28.476 --> 04:30.228
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:30.311 --> 04:34.065
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:45.118
(theme music playing)

05:41.966 --> 05:43.468
What is this, El Salvador?

05:43.551 --> 05:45.219
I mean, big deal, I was out
at Coley's last night.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.721
Hey, it's cool, man.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.098
The cat had just mentioned that he ran
into you at the bar, that's all.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.101
Yeah, sure. So where am I supposed to go
to line up new talent, huh?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.187
Bowling alleys? Pizza stands?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.939
Hey, look, lover, it's your wagon.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.276
I had four lousy tonic waters
and one sip of the stew's mai tai.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.487
And why don't you mind your own
damn business, Buchanan?

06:02.570 --> 06:04.697
All I'm saying is I was feeling
kind of sick this morning.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.616
Well, it's too bad the bet you made
doesn't have a virus clause, hmm?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.076
Too bad my life doesn't have
a Renko clause.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.079
Renko, don't tell me that you're having
second thoughts about the shooting match.

06:11.162 --> 06:11.996
Dream on, tuna.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.456
The only second thoughts I'm having

06:13.539 --> 06:16.000
is how much of your paycheck
I'm gonna blow tonight.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.460
Two to one?

06:17.543 --> 06:20.380
Hey, you didn't tell me
you were favored 2-to-1.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.716
-Am I really?
-Yeah, look here, 2-to-1 odds for--

06:23.800 --> 06:26.928
You think some geek with a wild hair
and a nose full of dust

06:27.011 --> 06:29.263
is gonna give you odds in an alley shoot?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.934
Judas. Webster, would you inform the men
that Operation Jezebel

06:33.017 --> 06:36.521
is running five minutes late because
of this .38 caliber quiniela?

06:37.105 --> 06:40.149
Of course, there's some types that
would bet on the invasion of Normandy

06:40.233 --> 06:41.567
if they got the right spread.

06:42.485 --> 06:47.198
No offense, Frank. I can't help wondering
if maybe you're a little overextended.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.243
How so?

06:51.327 --> 06:53.037
Everything okay on the personal front?

06:54.372 --> 06:55.206
Just fine.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.376
You know, Frank,

06:59.919 --> 07:02.296
when I was ramrodding the 23rd Precinct--

07:03.506 --> 07:05.800
I was the youngest captain
they'd ever had there, by the way.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.720
It was right around the time your Negroes
and your Hispanics

07:09.804 --> 07:13.474
were starting to kick up a fuss
about discrimination in the department.

07:13.558 --> 07:17.353
Well, there was a lot of resistance
to them at the time.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.856
And I don't mind telling you

07:20.648 --> 07:23.526
that as a young liberal,
I was under a hell of a lot of pressure.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.529
So, in the middle of all this,

07:27.071 --> 07:31.284
the brotherhood of Italian police officers
started to bust my chops.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.620
Well, that really frosted my flakes.

07:35.621 --> 07:40.418
So, I got their ringleader into my office,
and I dropped him.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.589
Told him I didn't care if he was connected
to the godfather himself.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.924
No bunch of hotheaded dagos--

07:47.008 --> 07:50.219
Sorry, Frank, Italians--
was gonna tell Fletcher P. Daniels

07:50.303 --> 07:52.597
how the hell to run his precinct.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.557
Damn, I was hot!

07:58.352 --> 08:00.563
-(laughs)
-Point being?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.941
(laughs) Well, the point being, Frank,

08:05.526 --> 08:06.903
I wasn't pacing myself.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.613
I was overtired.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.824
I had some problems
at home with the missus.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.911
I was afraid I'd flunk
the commander's test.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.706
Are you suggesting that my attempts

08:18.789 --> 08:20.791
to take Jesse John Hudson
out of circulation

08:20.875 --> 08:23.294
are some sort of misplaced anger?

08:23.377 --> 08:26.088
I'm only saying it might have been
more prudent

08:26.172 --> 08:29.217
to have given him a little more rope
and let him hang himself.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.551
How much more?

08:31.093 --> 08:33.346
He's already guilty of two gang murders,

08:33.429 --> 08:36.224
an armory job,
and the execution of one of my men.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.353
Frank, bring me proof
of any of these allegations,

08:40.436 --> 08:43.606
and you know that I'll support you
tighter than a brown jockstrap.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.942
So what are you telling me?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.903
That the D.A. is going
to recommend dismissal?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.365
(groans)

08:53.407 --> 08:54.825
What I'm telling you is,

08:56.244 --> 08:59.872
that there's only one party
that can come out ahead in this mess,

09:00.122 --> 09:01.916
and that's Jesse John Hudson.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.671
Consider it, my friend. That's all I ask.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.175
You oughta know better than to sneak up
on my backhand like that, Furillo.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.263
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it
take two people to play this sport?

09:58.723 --> 10:02.643
I don't trust myself with a blunt
instrument around people this morning.

10:04.478 --> 10:10.067
Besides, I had my fill of gamesmanship
at the courthouse this morning.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.819
The Susan Downey case.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.823
Great system of justice
we work with, Frank.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.957
I take it that means
you went for the plea bargain.

10:25.833 --> 10:26.792
Don't worry, Furillo.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.462
That cop of yours came out
smelling like a rose.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.297
Too bad you weren't down there.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.842
I could have used some help explaining
to my client why she should feel lucky

10:34.925 --> 10:38.429
getting off with only a misdemeanor
after being assaulted in a parking lot.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.806
If there'd been any evidence
against Lambert,

10:40.890 --> 10:42.767
you wouldn't have made
the deal in the first place.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.019
Easy for you to say.
You didn't have to watch her break down

10:45.102 --> 10:46.354
on the courthouse steps.

10:46.437 --> 10:50.691
Oh, come on, Joyce.
I was after the truth just as much as you.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.653
It was simply a matter
of her word against his.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.279
What are you so angry about?

10:55.738 --> 10:59.033
You plea bargain 10 cases a month
worse than this one.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.409
I don't know, Frank.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.746
I was angry even before
I woke up this morning.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.500
Sleeping alone will do that to you.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.962
I'll ignore the presumption
of that remark.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.216
Oh, come on. I wasn't asking for the moon.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.635
All I want is an open rela--

11:17.718 --> 11:19.428
Relationship, I know.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.682
I have been listening to the same broken
record ever since our first overnight.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.599
Open relationship.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.267
You wouldn't have to
if you weren't so stubborn.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.936
Stubborn? Stubborn?

11:27.353 --> 11:30.356
That's funny coming from a man
with a boilerplate between his ears.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.693
Or need I remind you who initiated
this little separation.

11:35.319 --> 11:39.365
Because I'm sick and tired of playing
second-string to a legal career?

11:39.990 --> 11:42.576
Because just once,
I'd like to kiss you in public

11:42.660 --> 11:44.995
without your screaming,
"Conflict of interest."

11:45.079 --> 11:48.332
Conflict of interest
could soil us both, my friend.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.585
We had a pretty good thing going,
pizza man, and you screwed it up.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.254
And that's what's wrong with that.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.631
Come on, Joyce. We're in a fishbowl here.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.134
But I thought you wanted
an open relationship, Frank.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.012
I'm sorry, sir, but, uh, you can't be
on the court in your street shoes.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.140
Do you mind, huh? Do you mind?

12:11.188 --> 12:13.691
What do you want me to do, Frank?
Rent a billboard?

12:13.816 --> 12:15.276
Put an ad in the personals?

12:16.068 --> 12:18.779
Drive down to City Hall screaming
I have carnal knowledge

12:18.863 --> 12:20.698
of an Italian precinct captain?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.826
If the need arises, counselor,

12:25.953 --> 12:27.538
I'm sure you'll think of something.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.627
(condescending chuckle)

12:38.507 --> 12:39.467
Bye, baby.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.347
-Well?
-(chattering)

12:47.433 --> 12:49.518
(horn honking)

12:51.604 --> 12:55.316
(sirens wailing)

13:00.738 --> 13:02.364
(police radio chatter)

13:07.328 --> 13:09.205
Oh, I can't believe it.
They're not gonna run.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.583
HILL: Hold it. Easy. The hunt is all over.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.794
-Let's go. Come on, Jasmine.
-Well, how's tricks, my friends?

13:14.877 --> 13:15.711
What do you say we go have

13:15.795 --> 13:16.796
-a little bit of brunch?
-You got it all wrong.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.672
We were just getting some rays over there.
That's all.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.509
And I suppose that clown that just
pulled away was your tanning consultant.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.595
-Hi, girls.
-(women groaning)

13:24.678 --> 13:26.764
-Come on.
-I'm sorry.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.390
Lucy, I don't wanna go down there.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.769
You know, a big blond dominant type like
yourself can make a fortune on the street.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.771
-Hey, you behave yourself.
-No, I mean it.

13:33.854 --> 13:34.688
A little Spanish rouge,

13:34.772 --> 13:36.524
-you could write your own ticket.
-Farrah, shut up.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.818
MAN: Right over here.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.987
Here is the coach that's gonna take
my little princesses to dinner

13:42.071 --> 13:42.988
at the Maison de Hill Street.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.615
This is a bogus beef, and you know it.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.702
No, this is Section 415 of the penal code,
creating a public nuisance.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.413
This is the last time I'm gonna do
a bachelor party for you or your friends.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.499
You want a nuisance, big boy?
I'll give you a--

13:53.582 --> 13:54.416
(yells)

13:54.500 --> 13:57.253
(clamoring, yelling)

13:57.336 --> 13:59.171
-You're losing your bust, Luce.
-I got it.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.467
-(tires skid)
-MAN: Watch out, you moron!

14:05.344 --> 14:07.888
(dog barking)

14:09.807 --> 14:11.183
Is that kind of food spicy?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.064
Would someone please retrieve this woman?

14:19.608 --> 14:22.736
Oh, nothing for you
to be concerned about, Grace.

14:22.820 --> 14:27.491
It's just a desperate fille de joie
being run down by one of my, uh,

14:28.492 --> 14:29.326
persons.

14:30.661 --> 14:34.373
Now, tell me about this Danish film
that you got tickets to.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.128
-(siren wailing in distance)
-(door opens)

14:40.421 --> 14:41.255
BATES: Lori?

14:43.215 --> 14:44.842
Come on down. Nobody's gonna hurt you.

14:48.429 --> 14:52.016
Lori? What is the big deal?

14:53.475 --> 14:57.187
Fifty dollars bail,
you're gonna be outta here by--

14:59.607 --> 15:00.441
Lori.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.366
Are you gonna come here,
or do I have to come get you?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.994
(whimpering)

15:13.787 --> 15:15.164
Are you listenin' to me?

15:17.249 --> 15:20.544
Lucy, let this stuff take effect,
and I promise.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.171
Put it down, Lori.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.965
Right now, I mean it.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.802
I haven't scored in two days.
My whole damn body's crampin' up.

15:29.470 --> 15:33.432
Lucy, please, you know I'm gonna be
in that place for hours. Lucy--

15:33.515 --> 15:36.644
Lori, I can't let ya. I just can't.
Not right in front of me.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.604
Well, then just turn around for a second!

15:39.605 --> 15:42.441
(sobbing) I'm beggin' you, man.

15:42.942 --> 15:48.656
Lucy, last time I was in that damn cell,
I almost hung myself.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.909
You saw me, man. You know how it was.

15:52.826 --> 15:58.999
For God sakes, would you just please
just turn around for a second?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.002
(sniffles) Lucy, please.

16:03.712 --> 16:07.424
(sobbing continues)

16:11.136 --> 16:15.057
(breathing heavily)

16:22.815 --> 16:24.441
(gasps)

16:25.401 --> 16:26.235
COFFEY: Lucy?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.240
Lucy? Lucy, where are you?

16:33.742 --> 16:34.785
What the hell happened?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.666
Uh, I lost her.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.337
When I found her, she was like this.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.841
All right. Just stay with her.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.515
All right, ladies.
Right this way, come on.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.642
Move it out. Move it out.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.853
See, the problem is,
when something like this happens,

17:00.936 --> 17:03.605
and if they see me like this,
then they may take me out for a day.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.233
-I'm sorry.
-Are you buying or just browsing, Fido?

17:08.402 --> 17:10.821
-I'm really sorry.
-Get in there. I'm sick of this!

17:10.904 --> 17:13.365
Nice hands, son. Real nice.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.870
J.D., can't you do something about this?

17:17.953 --> 17:20.080
I mean, we're just selling
a service to the public.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.624
It came down from Division, baby.
My hands are tied.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.542
Don't you wish, lover man.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.919
Hey, hey, I don't like it any better
than they do.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.047
-Well, J.D., would you get Lamont--
-Come on, Buffy.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.673
-and tell him to get his butt down here?
-Let's go, Buffy.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.592
I have to pick up my kid at day care
by 3:00.

17:31.675 --> 17:32.968
-Right. You got it.
-Buffy, move it.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.678
Hunter must be kiddin', man.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.480
She gonna be all right?

17:45.731 --> 17:46.732
They wouldn't tell me.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.985
Look, Lucy, I know you're thinking

17:50.069 --> 17:52.446
if you could have been there
just one minute sooner,

17:52.529 --> 17:55.240
you could have stopped her,
but you weren't.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.576
So try and forget about it, huh?

17:58.786 --> 17:59.620
Yeah.

18:00.954 --> 18:02.331
I better get back.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.087
Real Folies Bergère
you got going here today.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.422
Well, hello, Mac.
What are you doing up here?

18:10.506 --> 18:11.673
Oh, nothing much, Freemason.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.384
I just thought I'd come up
and take my best buddy to lunch.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.095
Lunch?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.556
Yeah, it's a meal, Phil.
It comes between breakfast and dinner.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.935
Well, I appreciate the offer,
but I don't go to lunch.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.146
Oh, come on, joker.
Everybody goes to lunch.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.565
Well, this might seem hard to believe,

18:28.649 --> 18:31.151
but I haven't been out of this squad room
for lunch in, uh--

18:33.195 --> 18:36.365
My God, it must be nearly three years.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.743
Tell him nothing exotic, huh?
We haven't got all day.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.121
LaRue and Washington, they're gonna make
a pit stop on the way over.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.831
-What do you say?
-I'm not hungry.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.124
Come on, Mick.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.167
We've been at it since 7:30
this morning without a bite.

18:47.918 --> 18:48.961
Okay, Henry.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.591
Let me have, uh, Bermuda onion
and sardine on pumpernickel,

18:54.675 --> 18:58.345
side of anchovies and a couple
of kosher pickles, full sour.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.389
He says Bermuda onion
and sardine on pumpernickel.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.809
Bermuda onion and sardine on pumpernickel.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.354
And a couple of kosher pickles, full sour.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.565
That's disgusting.
The man lives on sewage.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.441
Okay, Henry, what about yourself?

19:11.525 --> 19:15.404
Uh, brisket on a kaiser,
side of horseradish and a cream soda.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.866
Okay, got it. Be there in a half an hour.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.952
(chuckles)
And you talk about how us brothers eat.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.163
No wonder they feel persecuted.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.456
MAN: All right, let's go, Kathy.
In there, have a seat.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.251
-Come on. Right through here.
-That's a metal detector?

19:29.334 --> 19:32.045
Yeah, you've been through it enough times.
Just pretend you're at the airport.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.631
-Got a problem here or what?
-Ain't got no problem here, honey.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.008
Just this little ol' thing is all.

19:36.091 --> 19:36.925
Blade!

19:37.009 --> 19:39.261
(clamoring)

19:39.344 --> 19:41.305
He done told me to hand over all my metal.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.016
Don't let me ruin your manicure now.
So just drop it, all right?

19:44.099 --> 19:46.143
I wasn't gonna cut nobody. I swear it.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.270
-All right.
-I was just taking it out of my getup

19:48.353 --> 19:50.147
-so the metal detector wouldn't go off.
-All right, baby.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.192
-'Cause she was done searching me.
-Watch it. Watch it, girl.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.902
-Watch your mouth!
-I was just taking it out of my getup

19:54.985 --> 19:57.487
-so the metal detector wouldn't catch me.
-Cool it, Renko.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.615
-I'm in no mood for this stuff. I mean it.
-No big deal, Lucy.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.617
You know, you're lucky it wasn't
a flamethrower or something.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.619
-That's perfect. I gotta listen to this?
-Yes, you do.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.704
I make one crummy little mistake,
and I gotta listen to this.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.873
-Everybody makes mistakes, Luce.
-That is just perfect. No, not everybody.

20:07.956 --> 20:10.292
Because this time,
it's me that made the mistake. The woman.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.211
-That's right.
-HILL: Oh, come on, Bates. Come on.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.838
Calm down.
Bobby didn't mean anything by that.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.048
What are you telling me to calm down for?

20:16.131 --> 20:19.134
-Tell Heckle and Jeckle to calm down.
-Hey, knock off the Heckle and Jeckle.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.052
Can you believe this bull?

20:20.135 --> 20:21.511
If you want me to handle
your beefs, I'll handle 'em.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.347
What the hell's happening here?

20:23.430 --> 20:25.432
Nothing's happening, Lieutenant.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.309
Your foot!
What's the matter with your foot?

20:27.851 --> 20:29.561
She stepped on my foot
when I was on patrol.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.522
Your foot, your arm, your everything.
Come on, let's get to work!

20:43.116 --> 20:45.285
Francis, a moment of your time.

20:46.954 --> 20:51.625
I-I just want you to know that, uh,
I'm going out to lunch.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.044
Okay.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.798
Well, unless you think I oughtn't.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.217
Uh, no, that's fine, Phil. Go right ahead.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.596
You know, I've never gone out to lunch.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.642
Well, not as long as
I've been on the Hill, anyway.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.353
Give it a try.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.482
Oh, the squad room could turn into chaos.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.319
Phil, take a look out there.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.198
(chattering)

21:23.282 --> 21:25.242
-Oh, wow!
-(glass breaks)

21:31.498 --> 21:32.749
I'll just be an hour.

21:34.042 --> 21:34.876
Bon appétit.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.838
I'll leave a number just in case.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.047
Good idea.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.426
(chattering continues)

21:42.509 --> 21:43.760
Brisket, Goldblume.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.513
Ham and cheese,<i> pour moi.</i>

21:47.639 --> 21:49.599
Septic surprise, Belker.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.893
-Beef tongue?
-Hey, that's mine, babe.

21:52.102 --> 21:52.936
Beef tongue, right.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.230
Yeah, right.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.274
Look at this place, Neal.
I mean, look at us.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.652
We're working in a lousy dump,
eating garbage out of wax paper.

22:00.736 --> 22:01.945
What kind of a life is that?

22:02.029 --> 22:04.406
Hey, we serve and protect, babe.
Serve and protect.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.783
Yeah, well, you know,
couldn't we serve and protect

22:06.867 --> 22:08.327
at, like, the Fontainebleau in Miami

22:08.410 --> 22:10.370
or maybe run security
at the Kahala Hilton?

22:10.454 --> 22:11.538
Think about that.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.333
Hey, man, we could put out a few
discreet feelers, you know.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.877
Become security analysts.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.421
Hell, we'll take Belker along
for the rodent problem.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.423
Hey, why don't you lighten up
on the dude, huh, man?

22:21.798 --> 22:23.300
Just trying to cheer the man up,
that's all.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.217
(growling)

22:24.301 --> 22:25.552
All right. Okay.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.972
You're the one who dragged us
to that encounter weekend.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.515
You're the one who's always talking about

22:30.599 --> 22:32.726
communication being the key
to understanding.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.853
And now one little problem,

22:34.936 --> 22:37.189
and you're the one who's refusing
to articulate their feelings.

22:37.272 --> 22:38.732
(woman, indistinct)

22:38.815 --> 22:42.277
Now doesn't that strike you as being
grossly hypocritical? Doesn't it?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.403
RACHEL (over phone):
<i>No, it doesn't strike me that way.</i>

22:43.487 --> 22:46.365
Rachel? Hey, look.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.491
-I didn't mean-- Rachel.
-RACHEL:<i> Look, I'm just saying</i>

22:47.574 --> 22:48.950
<i>-I am hanging up.</i>
-Do not hang up.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.287
Hanging up is a denial of my human rights,
not to mention my spousal rights.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.289
-And it's an emascu--
-(hangs up, dial tone)

22:57.334 --> 22:58.627
You tried hittin' her, Henry?

23:00.712 --> 23:03.090
Great, John. You're a huge help.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.383
I know my women, Henry.

23:05.133 --> 23:05.967
Your women?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.845
You haven't had a meaningful relationship
with a woman

23:08.929 --> 23:10.389
since your mother quit breast-feeding you.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.390
Hey, hey!

23:11.473 --> 23:13.350
Not true, my man. Not true.

23:13.642 --> 23:14.976
I got a lot of love in me.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.978
It takes more than one woman to handle it.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.731
I got to have multiples for the spillage.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.109
-You can say that again, lover.
-Mm-hmm.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.611
Hey, what's shakin'
with Hudson anyway, man?

23:24.694 --> 23:28.407
Nothin', the slimebag's been holed up
ever since he made bail last night.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.158
LARUE: Hey, that's a nice-looking
set of wheels.

23:30.242 --> 23:33.203
Yeah, belongs to that blond lawyer
he's been racking with.

23:33.286 --> 23:36.081
She showed up about 5:00 this morning.
Hasn't come out since.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.959
Hey, he's a stallion.
Gotta give him credit for that.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.003
Hey, why don't you guys
grab some Z's, man?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.672
Me and J.D., we can take over from here.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.467
I'm not leaving this scum, Washington.
Not till his arraignment goes through.

23:48.927 --> 23:49.761
Hey, look, Mick.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.930
I know how you feel
about Virgil and all that, man--

23:52.013 --> 23:52.848
MICK: No, you don't.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.391
Hey, hwy, someone's coming out.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.019
BELKER: Oh, it's the lawyer, McBride.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.988
WASHINGTON: I don't know, babe.
She just doesn't look right to me.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.158
(car engine starts)

24:12.909 --> 24:15.745
(tires skid, horn honks)

24:15.829 --> 24:18.206
Dame's gonna kill somebody
driving around like that.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.250
WASHINGTON: Oh, man, I'd better call in
to have her pulled over.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.964
(tires squealing, skidding)

24:26.047 --> 24:29.009
Hey, what's goin' on out here? Hey!

24:29.926 --> 24:31.636
Better call for an ambulance.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.689
Mm-mmm.

24:44.483 --> 24:49.112
Well, that sure beats
brown-bagging it at the station.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.113
Thank you, Mac.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.531
My pleasure, Phil.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.495
Look, maybe we can make lunch here
kinda like a regular thing, huh?

24:57.913 --> 25:01.082
I really think I'd like that.
Regular lunch with a good buddy?

25:01.666 --> 25:03.710
Yes, I think I'd like that quite a bit.

25:03.793 --> 25:04.628
Good.

25:07.130 --> 25:09.299
You know, Phil, like most guys,

25:09.382 --> 25:11.843
I'm a little clumsy
in the sentiment department.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.428
I just wanted you to know that,

25:14.513 --> 25:17.224
well, I've appreciated your friendship
in the past few weeks.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.226
Nah, you don't have to be embarrassed.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.187
I, myself, would have never
made it through the month

25:22.270 --> 25:24.231
without somebody like you to talk to.

25:27.108 --> 25:31.029
God, you know, we're a lot alike, Phil.
I mean, I tried it all, too.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.489
I mean, just like you're doing now.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.117
God, Joan and I broke up, and, uh--

25:36.826 --> 25:39.329
Hell, it was the bars,
the one-night stands,

25:39.412 --> 25:40.830
then the cruising, you know.

25:40.914 --> 25:45.001
After Margaret and I broke up,
with Cindy and Grace Gardner,

25:45.085 --> 25:48.046
I hardly had the energy to walk,
much less cruise.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.464
(chuckling)

25:49.881 --> 25:54.344
I know what you mean, you were kind of up
to your earflaps in women, huh?

25:55.095 --> 25:57.055
(chuckles) Yeah.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.559
You know, the only trouble with that is

26:00.642 --> 26:04.145
you kind of feel like there's something
missing in your life, you know?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.899
Hmm. You know, I think you're right.

26:11.486 --> 26:15.073
You know, Phil, I may be misreading
this situation, I know,

26:15.156 --> 26:19.911
but when I first met you,
I-I sensed another persona in you.

26:19.995 --> 26:24.249
Uh, an identity that was kind of waiting
to be released.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.418
Hmm. Another persona, huh?

26:28.253 --> 26:29.963
That's very perceptive of you, Mac.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.758
Do you realize I've spent
nearly my entire adult life

26:33.842 --> 26:38.346
being regarded by people
as just another guy in a blue uniform?

26:38.430 --> 26:41.349
(chuckles) You look great
in a uniform, Phil,

26:41.433 --> 26:44.644
but what's important it seems is--

26:45.645 --> 26:48.440
I don't know. It's how you see yourself.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.025
You know?

26:50.567 --> 26:53.361
You're probably gonna laugh when
I tell you this, but when I was a kid,

26:54.029 --> 26:57.490
I had my heart set on being
a concert pianist.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.744
(laughing)

27:00.827 --> 27:02.787
Can you imagine that, with these paws?

27:02.871 --> 27:04.247
(laughing)

27:05.582 --> 27:07.042
You have beautiful hands, Phil.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.170
-Get outta here.
-No, Phil, look at those.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.756
No, Phil, I mean it. I--

27:12.839 --> 27:14.549
I like your hands. I like 'em a lot.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.344
I've had dreams about those hands, Phil.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.057
Very funny, MacAllister.
Now will you get serious?

27:23.433 --> 27:25.560
Phil, I've never been
more serious in my life.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.358
I care about you very deeply.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.654
And I think it's time that
we expand our relationship.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.489
What relationship?

27:39.199 --> 27:40.784
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.827
Come on, Phil. Don't be so damn coy.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.122
I'm gay, Phil.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.417
I want you in every sense of the word.

27:49.626 --> 27:52.003
And I'm hoping very much
that you want me as much.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.506
Oh, I don't believe this is happening.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.218
Believe it, Phil.

27:58.927 --> 27:59.761
No.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.143
Look, Phil, if, uh--

28:08.853 --> 28:11.356
if I've offended you, I apologize.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.779
But I don't apologize for being honest
about my feelings.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.366
Nor do I apologize for being what I am.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.995
Mike, how could you think that of me?

28:26.663 --> 28:32.293
How could you think that I was
some sort of ho-- ho--

28:33.253 --> 28:34.504
Homosexual, Phil.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.174
Go ahead, say it.
It's just a word. It won't bite.

28:38.883 --> 28:39.718
Neither will I.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.472
Oh, come on, Phil.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.892
Phil, sit down. Don't leave. Come on.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.896
Phil, we're still friends, aren't we?

28:51.980 --> 28:53.314
No, we're not.

28:57.777 --> 28:58.611
Phil--

29:01.448 --> 29:02.615
Phil, please.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.911
I wish we were, but we're not.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.509
Well, it's no secret that he blamed her
for getting busted last night, Captain.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.220
-What does she have to say about it?
-She's not talkin'.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.348
(siren wailing in distance)

29:27.432 --> 29:28.725
Attending physician's report.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.521
"Contusions around both eyes,
broken rib, abrasions in the neck."

29:34.939 --> 29:35.940
You don't get that kind of damage

29:36.024 --> 29:38.902
scattering trash cans
at 15 miles per, Captain.

29:39.986 --> 29:43.323
(sighs) She had the hell beat out of her
before she even got near that car.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.367
You said she was walking funny
when she left his apartment.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.660
She wasn't stoned, Captain.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.537
We scoped the blood tests
coming out of the lab.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.498
-If she was high on anything...
-No booze, no dope.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.917
...it was pure, uncut Jesse John Hudson.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.169
WOMAN (on P.A.):
<i>Nurse Johnson to Intensive Care.</i>

29:56.252 --> 29:57.921
<i>Nurse Johnson to Intensive Care.</i>

29:58.922 --> 30:01.299
FRANK: I want you to file
assault charges against him.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.802
With your testimony,
we can put him away for good.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.766
Open your eyes, Miss McBride.
He's a dangerous man.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.436
I've been cleaning up after him
ever since he hit the streets.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.189
Murders, extortion.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.819
Half a dozen assaults that make yours
look like a love tap.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.696
All of it part of an organized drive

30:23.780 --> 30:27.575
to disenfranchise this community
in the guise of social reform.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.204
For God's sake,
don't let him use people this way.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.580
It's all a mask.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.707
And as soon as it's served his purpose,
he'll throw it away.

30:34.791 --> 30:35.625
You know that, too.

30:45.718 --> 30:46.719
Think about it, lady.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.892
MAN (on P.A.):<i> Commence firing.</i>

30:58.731 --> 30:59.899
Okay, Bobby, let's put this
baby in gear and drive it home.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.901
All right, Luce, settle down.
We're blowing it.

31:01.985 --> 31:03.194
Yeah, don't you mean I'm blowing it?

31:03.278 --> 31:04.362
We're even on the match,

31:04.445 --> 31:06.197
one up on the Nassau
and three up on the press.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.867
She keeps shooting like this, we're gonna
have to get ourselves a business manager.

31:08.950 --> 31:09.951
What are you, Howard Cosell or something?

31:10.034 --> 31:12.370
You wanna can
the play-by-play remarks, Renko?

31:12.453 --> 31:13.538
BATES: And you too, Bobby?

31:13.621 --> 31:15.373
Just wait a minute, it's not our fault

31:15.456 --> 31:18.084
-you shoot like a suburban housewife.
-What did I say?

31:18.167 --> 31:20.003
All right. That-- that's it.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.505
You guys have been on my case
since that hooker sweep this morning.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.257
-I've had it.
-Luce, nobody's been on your case.

31:24.340 --> 31:26.092
Why don't you can it?
We got a match to finish here.

31:26.593 --> 31:27.594
Oh, great.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.138
You take your stinkin' match
and your lousy Nassau,

31:30.221 --> 31:34.809
and your stupid, obnoxious
locker-room comments and stop it!

31:36.019 --> 31:37.478
Looks like you owe us
some money there, boy.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.563
Yeah, way to go, guys.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.773
-I'll be right there, Chief.
<i>-It's very important that you're here.</i>

31:40.857 --> 31:43.067
-Yes, I realize that.
<i>-How long for you to get down here?</i>

31:43.151 --> 31:44.360
-Ten minutes.
<i>-All right.</i>

31:44.444 --> 31:45.278
Right.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.698
I know you're just out the door,
but could I talk to you?

31:49.407 --> 31:50.742
-Sure.
-Off the record.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.040
What's the problem?

31:57.749 --> 32:00.960
That girl that collapsed today,
this morning, on the hooker sweep?

32:01.377 --> 32:02.629
What about her?

32:03.421 --> 32:04.589
It was my fault.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.883
I caught her in the tenement
before she shot up.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.930
She begged me, she said that she'd never
make it through booking if she didn't fix.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.015
And you let her?

32:15.558 --> 32:16.643
She's just a kid, Captain.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.895
I mean, it's bad enough having to go
through booking and all that stuff

32:18.978 --> 32:20.647
without having to deal with
drug withdrawal.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.024
-So I turned my back.
-(sighs)

32:23.983 --> 32:24.817
Is she gonna make it?

32:25.193 --> 32:26.027
Yeah.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.488
I called the hospital.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.574
But it doesn't make me feel any better.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.575
It shouldn't.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.622
-What would you have done?
-I would have arrested her for possession.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.791
I sure wouldn't have turned my back
while she shot up.

32:40.249 --> 32:42.877
Oh, so you pull her in cold, you book her,

32:43.544 --> 32:46.673
and then maybe you find her hanging
in the holding cell the next morning.

32:47.548 --> 32:51.678
Lucy, if I let every loser
with a sad story get to me like that,

32:51.761 --> 32:53.763
I wouldn't be worth spit on the job,
neither would you.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.390
Isn't that a little hard-nosed?

33:02.522 --> 33:06.192
Lucy, we all know it's not exactly
an uplifting experience out there,

33:06.275 --> 33:08.111
so sometimes we wanna reach out.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.197
You feel maybe if you give them
a little of your time,

33:12.615 --> 33:15.243
maybe even turn your back on a couple
of rules, you might be able to help 'em.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.120
Show them there's something
better out there.

33:18.037 --> 33:21.040
Believe me, mostly,
they'll take that as a sign of weakness.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.334
What am I supposed to do
about my feelings?

33:23.418 --> 33:24.460
Do I just turn them off
for eight hours a day?

33:24.544 --> 33:27.088
I don't want any of my people
disconnecting from their feelings,

33:27.171 --> 33:30.008
but you do have to learn
that you can't always act on them.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.097
You're a good cop.
I wish I had more like you.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.853
I wish you'd tell that to those gorillas
I work with out there.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.522
They've been on me today
like a cheap suit.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.235
You're also tougher
than you give yourself credit for.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.530
Next time they lean on you,
you lean on them.

33:55.783 --> 33:58.953
Frank, you're due in court
in less than five minutes.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.248
-FRANK: Are you okay with this?
-No.

34:02.707 --> 34:06.085
But I'm gettin' there. Thanks, Captain.

34:10.173 --> 34:13.718
(humming)

34:14.385 --> 34:17.597
<i>Comment ça va, </i>Phil? (continues humming)

34:21.684 --> 34:23.394
You look a little tight
around the cinch belt.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.566
Hey, Sarge, you got any cream rinse?

34:29.192 --> 34:31.319
No, I don't have any cream rinse.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.739
Do I look like the kind of man
who uses cream rinse?

34:35.156 --> 34:38.701
Hair-wise, Phil, you don't look like
the kind of man who even uses shampoo.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.412
(chuckles)

34:43.372 --> 34:47.085
Mm, doggone it.
Phil, how's your supply of aftershave?

34:54.258 --> 34:55.093
Thanks.

34:56.969 --> 35:00.181
(sniffs) Oh, Judas.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.768
"Eau de fruit bronze."

35:04.644 --> 35:05.561
What's the matter with it?

35:06.938 --> 35:08.648
Well, no offense meant, but, uh,

35:09.565 --> 35:10.983
it's a little fruity for my taste.

35:11.651 --> 35:12.485
Fruity?

35:13.152 --> 35:15.238
That's what it says there-- fruit.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.074
I don't care what anybody says.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.743
I am not fruity.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.835
-(men chattering)
-Hmm.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.347
Hello, Phil.

35:42.265 --> 35:45.434
Grace. What are you doing here?

35:47.436 --> 35:50.356
I'm taking Howard

35:51.440 --> 35:56.529
to an exhibition of 15th century
Byzantine erotica

35:57.321 --> 35:58.781
at the Schoenbaum Gallery.

35:59.448 --> 36:00.283
Oh.

36:01.826 --> 36:02.660
How have you been?

36:03.202 --> 36:04.912
Oh, fine. Just fine.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.123
Yourself?

36:09.584 --> 36:12.170
Oh, it-- it's been

36:13.629 --> 36:15.173
day to day for me, Phil.

36:21.304 --> 36:22.180
Grace.

36:25.266 --> 36:29.854
Would you be brutally honest with me
about something?

36:32.815 --> 36:33.649
Always.

36:36.402 --> 36:41.032
Um, h-how would you characterize me,

36:41.115 --> 36:43.826
uh, sexually speaking?

36:48.915 --> 36:52.210
You're... tender.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.004
You're caring.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.217
You're giving. Oh, God, you're giving.

36:59.675 --> 37:03.429
Yeah, but, Grace,
do you find me in any way, uh,

37:04.472 --> 37:07.016
oh, limp-wristed?

37:08.559 --> 37:09.393
Phil!

37:10.895 --> 37:14.941
There is absolutely nothing limp

37:15.691 --> 37:18.277
in that entire glorious body.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.155
Oh, God, thank you, Grace.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.365
Oh,

37:24.075 --> 37:24.909
I've--

37:25.868 --> 37:28.162
I've yearned for you, my prince.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.208
There's never been anyone like you for me.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.586
(moaning)

37:37.463 --> 37:38.381
(chuckles)

37:40.299 --> 37:45.012
I'm-- I'm making an absolute fool
of myself, but I can't help it.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.101
Oh, well, Grace, uh,

37:50.768 --> 37:52.144
what about Howard?

37:53.521 --> 37:54.355
Howard?

37:55.481 --> 37:56.315
Yeah.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.401
Oh, Howard. Uh--

38:00.736 --> 38:02.113
Howard is, uh--

38:03.656 --> 38:04.657
He's a--

38:06.325 --> 38:08.327
He's a decent man, but he--

38:10.496 --> 38:12.623
he doesn't understand me the way you do.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.128
He doesn't touch me the way you do.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.381
Oh, he doesn't do it for me
the way you do.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.592
Oh, Phil, hold me, kiss me,

38:24.010 --> 38:25.303
make me yours again.

38:50.077 --> 38:53.664
MAN: How do you respond to the charges
of parole violation?

38:54.415 --> 38:56.375
You really think putting this guy
back in prison

38:56.459 --> 38:58.210
is gonna get him out of your hair, Frank?

38:58.294 --> 39:00.171
I want him off the Hill. I don't care how.

39:01.088 --> 39:03.341
I don't like public disagreements
with my men,

39:03.424 --> 39:04.675
but I'm on record with this one.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.344
I can't support your position.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.429
It's not the first time, Chief.

39:10.097 --> 39:14.560
(chattering)

39:14.643 --> 39:16.270
Mr. Hudson, we need a few questions.

39:18.939 --> 39:23.944
Okay, okay, I'll, uh, answer questions

39:24.528 --> 39:25.571
after the hearing.

39:26.822 --> 39:31.035
But for now, just let me say
that I'm not surprised to be here.

39:32.161 --> 39:32.995
Not at all.

39:34.205 --> 39:38.834
It's just another example
of an oppressive system using the police

39:38.918 --> 39:42.213
to divest the inner city
of its rightful leadership.

39:42.296 --> 39:43.339
But know this.

39:44.298 --> 39:46.675
They may be able to send me back,

39:47.635 --> 39:50.721
but they can never imprison
the calls that brought me here.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.224
You better pray they don't put him away.

39:57.603 --> 39:59.647
-WOMAN: Oh, my god!
-(clamoring)

40:02.108 --> 40:03.567
(clicking)

40:04.235 --> 40:05.778
MAN: She's got a gun. Grab her!

40:05.861 --> 40:06.779
MAN: Grab her.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.366
You better double up
the night shift, Frank.

40:10.449 --> 40:13.494
When this gets out,
the Hill's gonna go up in flames. Clear.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.132
-Sure seems peaceful enough.
-(police radio chatter)

40:28.884 --> 40:31.595
Well, if they were gonna torch the Hill,
they would have done it by now.

40:33.013 --> 40:34.515
Don't be so presumptuous, son.

40:35.808 --> 40:36.892
It's a long night.

40:38.811 --> 40:41.188
You know, I'll give these people credit
for one thing.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.817
At least they got the sense
to know this guy Hudson's

40:44.900 --> 40:46.527
not worth losing any sleep over.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.990
Maybe. No.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.243
But you know what, cowboy?

40:55.911 --> 40:59.290
I sure will feel a lot better
when this shift is done.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.800
Wasn't it kinda quiet like this
before the riots of '77?

41:15.598 --> 41:17.516
Let's go, Joe. Let's cruise.

41:18.642 --> 41:19.477
Yes, ma'am.

41:20.769 --> 41:21.604
Ciao, boys.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.314
You all keep a low profile.

41:24.023 --> 41:24.857
Yes, Mom.

41:25.232 --> 41:29.111
You know, if it stays quiet like this,
maybe the two of you

41:29.195 --> 41:33.032
can spend a couple hours practicing
some choke holds at the No Tell Motel.

41:33.782 --> 41:36.744
Keep it up, doughboy, you'll be taking
your meals through a straw.

41:39.663 --> 41:45.461
(water running)

41:45.711 --> 41:46.545
(turns water off)

41:48.839 --> 41:50.257
-Henry.
-Hi, Ray.

41:50.841 --> 41:51.842
Your wife is here.

41:52.468 --> 41:54.512
I asked her to wait in
the interrogation room.

41:54.803 --> 41:56.722
I thought you'd might
want a little privacy.

41:57.932 --> 41:59.975
-Thanks.
-That's all right.

42:36.303 --> 42:37.137
How are you?

42:38.097 --> 42:39.431
Tired. My back's killing me.

42:41.100 --> 42:42.101
You?

42:42.601 --> 42:43.435
Fine.

42:44.144 --> 42:45.104
How's Josh?

42:46.105 --> 42:47.606
He misses his father.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.484
What about you?

42:54.947 --> 42:55.864
I do, too.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.995
Then why won't you let me come home?

43:02.621 --> 43:03.747
Are you still seeing her?

43:07.126 --> 43:08.252
No.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.173
What's the matter, isn't it any fun
if you can't sneak around?

43:13.257 --> 43:14.216
Rachel, stop it.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.219
She's a fine woman.

43:19.930 --> 43:21.181
I spent some time with her.

43:22.057 --> 43:24.226
I'm very sorry it hurt you,
but I'm not sorry it happened.

43:25.978 --> 43:26.812
Rachel.

43:28.188 --> 43:31.442
I didn't go looking for this.
It just happened.

43:32.359 --> 43:33.193
(scoffs)

43:34.069 --> 43:37.156
We've been over it, Henry.
I know all about how it just happened.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.073
No, you don't.

43:39.742 --> 43:43.120
You say you know, but you can't,
not unless you've been there.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.081
I have been there.

43:50.502 --> 43:51.962
I had an affair once.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.298
When?

43:56.425 --> 43:57.468
Nine years ago.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.472
You were at Jefferson Heights.
I was going to school.

44:03.349 --> 44:06.060
You had that graveyard shift.
We never saw each other.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.313
Who was it?

44:09.730 --> 44:10.564
What's the difference?

44:10.648 --> 44:11.649
Who was it?

44:13.901 --> 44:15.361
My biology professor.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.404
Your biology professor.

44:22.743 --> 44:23.661
How appropriate.

44:27.122 --> 44:28.999
-You making this up?
-No.

44:29.958 --> 44:31.210
Then why the hell you telling me now?

44:32.252 --> 44:34.505
To hurt you the way you hurt me.

44:37.800 --> 44:41.303
You kept a secret from me for nine years.
At least I told you.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.556
You confessed because you felt guilty.

44:45.808 --> 44:47.935
What do you expect from me, absolution?

44:48.310 --> 44:49.770
You hurt me terribly.

44:50.270 --> 44:53.816
Now, if I'm gonna take you back,
I refuse to be a martyr.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.317
How, by evening the score?

44:55.401 --> 44:56.235
Yes.

44:56.568 --> 44:58.320
I need that for my self-esteem.

44:59.405 --> 45:00.406
Well, then how about mine?

45:01.532 --> 45:02.366
You had your tootsie.

45:02.449 --> 45:04.993
I assume she gave you
all the esteem you could handle.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.124
Hey, I don't know if I wanna come home

45:11.625 --> 45:13.168
if this is what I have to look forward to.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.382
Henry, I miss you.

45:21.301 --> 45:22.970
I haven't slept since you left.

45:24.096 --> 45:27.057
But I'm angry,
and it's going to take time.

45:28.851 --> 45:31.478
I don't want our marriage
to fall apart over this.

45:31.562 --> 45:35.357
B-But I can't promise you it's gonna be
exactly the same again.

45:38.819 --> 45:39.945
Too much has happened.

45:41.655 --> 45:43.073
If I hadn't had this affair,

45:45.659 --> 45:47.453
you never would have told me
about yours, would you?

45:48.245 --> 45:50.414
-No.
-Why not?

45:52.332 --> 45:55.127
Because when it happened,
it didn't have anything to do with you.

45:56.336 --> 45:59.173
It was my need, my crisis.

46:01.175 --> 46:04.970
And then when I realized
how I wanted to live my life

46:05.053 --> 46:09.266
and-- and who I wanted
to live it with, I ended it.

46:14.396 --> 46:16.607
I've never been with anyone but you since.

46:18.525 --> 46:19.943
It's no different for me, Rachel.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.574
You sure?

46:31.413 --> 46:32.247
All right.

46:34.875 --> 46:37.085
Then let's go home if you want.

46:50.307 --> 46:52.184
(phone ringing)

47:44.611 --> 47:45.821
Counselor?

47:46.780 --> 47:50.617
You want an open relationship?
You got an open relationship.

48:26.028 --> 48:28.030
(closing theme playing)
