00:02.240 --> 00:04.038
<i>Precedently on</i> Fargo...

00:07.400 --> 00:08.720
Who?

00:08.800 --> 00:09.950
Fargo!

00:10.080 --> 00:11.799
Freeze!
Police officer!

00:12.960 --> 00:14.280
Halt!

00:18.600 --> 00:20.751
That cop, the female,
says you are a suspect.

00:20.880 --> 00:21.870
Suspect of what?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.993
<i>For Pearl,
the Chief...
even Sam Hess.</i>

00:25.120 --> 00:28.636
<i>If you want this to go away,
you gotta give 'em someone.</i>

00:51.080 --> 00:52.116
<i>It's good waffles,
hon.</i>

00:53.960 --> 00:55.314
<i>It's a mix.</i>

00:56.800 --> 00:58.154
<i>Who's ready for seconds?</i>

01:01.800 --> 01:02.870
<i>- Gordo?
- Yeah.</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:05.150
<i>- Watcha doing there?
- Reading a comic.</i>

01:05.239 --> 01:08.153
<i>It's breakfast time,
though. It's supposed to
be family time.</i>

01:11.400 --> 01:13.232
<i>Yeah, put your
comic away, huh?</i>

01:13.320 --> 01:14.913
<i>- One more page.
- That's not...</i>

01:15.000 --> 01:17.913
<i>It's breakfast, mister,
family time.</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:20.395
<i>You heard your mother.</i>

01:20.480 --> 01:22.233
<i>700 to 1,000
people are without power...</i>

01:22.320 --> 01:24.755
Your mom needs
help after school.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.990
Got hockey.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.434
After hockey, then.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.920
I'm supposed to
play with Kevin.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.435
Well, you can play
with Kevin tomorrow.

01:31.520 --> 01:32.840
It's time you learned
some responsibility.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.520
<i>...thousands of fish
fell from the sky.</i>
Oh, hon, listen to this.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.429
<i>Meteorologists are saying
the incident was probably
caused by a tornado,</i>

01:39.520 --> 01:44.356
<i>which sucked up water
and fish from a lake and
dropped them off miles away.</i>

01:44.480 --> 01:47.200
<i>And we'll have more
on this developing news
story a little later tonight,</i>

01:47.280 --> 01:49.192
<i>along with our
meteorologist's take on
exactly what happened...</i>

01:49.320 --> 01:51.357
The darndest thing.
Come on, bud,
get your boots on.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.119
You don't wanna be
late for the bus.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.270
Kiss, kiss.
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.795
<i>...crews are out in force
this morning, and will be
working around the clock</i>

01:56.880 --> 01:58.200
<i>to keep roads as
clear as possible.</i>
Love you.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.640
- And me?
- Dad.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.791
<i>...as cleanup continues
on what reporters are calling</i>

02:01.880 --> 02:03.951
<i>the storm of the century.</i>

02:04.040 --> 02:05.269
<i>Plow drivers have
been working</i>

02:05.360 --> 02:08.558
<i>for 24 hours straight
without rest and
feel exhausted.</i>

02:08.639 --> 02:10.199
<i>We spoke to
one earlier today...</i>

02:23.360 --> 02:24.635
No funny stuff today.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.072
So then, Neo's like,
"I'm the One,"

02:43.160 --> 02:44.833
and Agent
What's-his-name is like...

02:44.920 --> 02:46.832
"The sound
of inevitability."
Yeah.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.991
And he's got him, right?
Around the neck.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.753
You're hurting me a little.
Don't be such a baby.

02:50.880 --> 02:51.996
Guys.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.595
So they're on the
tracks, right?
And the train's coming.

02:54.720 --> 02:56.552
And Neo says,
"No way." And he...

03:03.400 --> 03:04.390
Uh...

03:38.160 --> 03:40.720
So we're in the room
with the stripper, yeah?

03:40.800 --> 03:44.396
And Blackman
wants to know
how much for a blumkin.

03:44.480 --> 03:49.032
Which, I'm like...
"What the heck is that?"

03:49.120 --> 03:50.315
Blackman.
Yeah.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.711
So he says, you know,
"Why not stick around
and find out?"

03:53.800 --> 03:54.916
And I'm like...

03:55.000 --> 03:56.832
<i>Mr. Nygaard,
your wife is on one.</i>

03:56.920 --> 03:58.320
Yeah,
I'll call her back.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.039
<i>Oh, no,
she said it's urgent.</i>

04:03.680 --> 04:04.716
Yeah, hon.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.359
<i>Chaz,
the cops are here.</i>

04:06.440 --> 04:08.159
<i>Gordo's been arrested
and the cops are here.</i>

04:08.240 --> 04:09.276
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.789
What do you mean
the cops are there?
<i>In the house.</i>

04:12.880 --> 04:15.236
<i>They think that
Gordo brought
a gun to school.</i>

04:15.320 --> 04:16.595
<i>And they're tearing up
the house.</i>

04:16.680 --> 04:18.079
<i>They say they got
a search warrant.</i>

04:18.160 --> 04:21.709
Don't... Don't let them.
I... I'll be right there.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.598
Just...
I'll be right there!

04:23.680 --> 04:26.070
<i>Chaz, what have you done?</i>
I'm coming! I'm on my way!

04:26.200 --> 04:27.316
<i>Chaz?</i>

04:40.520 --> 04:41.590
Now...

04:41.680 --> 04:43.114
Wait, hold on!

04:44.320 --> 04:46.357
Hold on a minute What?

04:46.440 --> 04:48.272
You son of a bitch!
He's my baby!

04:48.400 --> 04:50.790
No, I got...
I got permits for those.
You son of a bitch!

04:52.880 --> 04:54.758
Now, Bill Oswalt,
hold on...

04:58.040 --> 04:59.759
Son of a bitch!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.834
I can explain that. I...

05:16.440 --> 05:17.954
What have you done?

05:37.320 --> 05:38.913
What have you done?

05:42.360 --> 05:43.919
You son of a bitch!

05:44.000 --> 05:45.320
I hate you.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.830
Hey. Bill...

06:14.080 --> 06:15.594
Busy morning, huh?

06:18.320 --> 06:20.152
Is there...

06:20.240 --> 06:22.391
some kind of development
with the case?

06:22.480 --> 06:23.709
Is that why I'm...

06:25.880 --> 06:27.280
Where's the female deputy?

06:27.360 --> 06:28.635
She got shot, Lester.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.356
She got...
In Duluth.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.999
I should be up
there right now,

06:33.120 --> 06:35.351
but then there's
this mess.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.193
I don't even know
where to start.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.797
It's like... When you see
on the news...
A boat sinks in India

06:41.920 --> 06:43.320
and 300 people drown.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.996
And you ask yourself,
"Do I know 300 people?"

06:47.080 --> 06:51.313
Or one of those
African massacres with
12 year-olds with machetes.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.629
And they kill,
You can't even...

06:52.720 --> 06:54.712
you can't even
count that high.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.113
We lost 16 people in
1920 to the flu.
I looked it up.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.954
In '78, six people died
in a pharmacy fire.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.793
But nothing
like this, ever.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.277
Three people murdered
in two days,

07:07.360 --> 07:08.760
including the
Chief of Police...

07:08.840 --> 07:10.513
Lenny Potts missing...

07:10.600 --> 07:14.276
and a cop shot.
And now a kid brings
a gun to school.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.236
A kid?

07:16.320 --> 07:17.959
It was Gordo, Lester.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.039
Gordo? My Gordo?

07:21.120 --> 07:24.955
He had a handgun
in his backpack.
Unloaded, thank gosh.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.000
But still, you can't
Not with the
current climate.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.230
Is he in trouble?

07:30.320 --> 07:34.314
Is he... He brought
a gun to school!

07:34.400 --> 07:38.155
And still,
Gordo's the least of this.
We searched the house.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.514
And, Lester,
I gotta tell ya,
I don't know whether to...

07:46.920 --> 07:47.910
After all these years,

07:48.000 --> 07:51.072
I'd like to think
that you could've...
come to me.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.436
You could've trusted me
as a friend with...

07:57.280 --> 07:59.840
We know you were
in the room when
Vern was shot.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.992
You had a shotgun pellet
in your hand,
same as killed Vern.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.476
Was your wife
having an affair?

08:18.720 --> 08:20.040
With Chaz?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.230
Mmm-hmm.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.510
We found a photo...
photos...

08:31.600 --> 08:34.195
at his place...
suggestive...

08:34.280 --> 08:35.395
I don't wanna
talk about...

08:35.480 --> 08:37.676
...boudoir photos
and a pair of...

08:37.760 --> 08:40.035
Bill...
Yeah. And I know...

08:40.120 --> 08:43.318
I know how much
you loved her.
I remember.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.393
Ninth grade science class,
Mrs. Nagutuck...

08:46.480 --> 08:47.755
Pearl walks in the
first day of class

08:47.880 --> 08:49.519
and sits down
and you look at me...

08:49.600 --> 08:51.910
"I'm gonna marry
that girl one day."

08:56.760 --> 08:58.240
But she was always...

08:59.440 --> 09:01.397
I know this is
out of line, but...

09:02.560 --> 09:04.153
we all heard the stories.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.790
But to sleep with
your own brother?
I know.

09:08.880 --> 09:11.600
God! Your own brother!

09:11.680 --> 09:14.320
And what then?
She tells him
it's over and he...

09:14.400 --> 09:16.756
We all know your
brother had a temper.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.956
He broke a guy's
nose once just

09:18.040 --> 09:19.838
for cracking wise
at the state fair.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.072
Yeah! I remember.
He had to do
community service.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.477
So what?
She cuts it off,
the affair, and then he...

09:32.400 --> 09:35.598
All I know is that I
came home from work

09:35.720 --> 09:37.837
and they were arguing
in the basement.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.116
I heard the voices.
I thought, "Is that Chaz?"

09:40.200 --> 09:41.919
And so I went
over to the top

09:42.000 --> 09:43.400
of the stairs to hear,
you know.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.559
And she says...

09:48.120 --> 09:49.190
Uh...

09:49.280 --> 09:52.637
"Love? Is that what
you think this is?"
Or something like that.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.279
And she laughs.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.195
And then she says,

09:58.280 --> 10:00.920
"You know,
you're not half the
man your brother is."

10:03.160 --> 10:05.277
Then I hear
this sound. This...

10:10.280 --> 10:12.476
I'll never forget it.
So... Um...

10:16.360 --> 10:18.079
...I run downstairs and...

10:19.840 --> 10:22.309
...there's Chaz.
And he's got the hammer...

10:22.400 --> 10:25.234
And he looks up
at me and says,
"Oh, geez, Lester.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.350
"What did I..."

10:31.720 --> 10:33.120
I'm upset.

10:34.840 --> 10:36.991
I try to get to Pearl,
you know,
to check if she's...

10:37.080 --> 10:39.754
And Chaz says to me,
"Lester, this was
an accident."

10:39.840 --> 10:44.471
And I'm... "An accident?"
He hit her with a hammer.

10:45.680 --> 10:50.277
And... he raises up
the hammer again.
He's still looking at me.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.591
I don't know if
he's gonna... or what.

10:52.680 --> 10:57.880
So I say, something like,
"Chaz, what the heck..."

11:04.040 --> 11:05.360
And the doorbell rings.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.189
Vern?
Mmm-hmm.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.320
I wanted to say
something, Bill.
I swear.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.397
But Chaz,
you know, he's...

11:14.520 --> 11:16.716
You were afraid?
Oh, I was afraid.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.278
And Chaz is my
only brother.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.514
So then what happens?
So then we go upstairs...

11:28.880 --> 11:31.475
and Chaz says,
"Take care of it."

11:31.560 --> 11:33.233
And he goes in the back.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.158
Where you
kept the shotgun.
Where I kept the shotgun.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.391
I should have thought
about the shotgun.
I know, I know.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.597
But I... I was in shock.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.991
So I let Vern in,
and right away,
I think to tell him,

11:43.080 --> 11:44.275
to say what's happened.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.113
Because Pearl
could still be
alive downstairs,

11:46.200 --> 11:48.920
there might still be
time to...

11:49.000 --> 11:52.471
And then Chaz comes
in with the shotgun.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.230
I should've stopped him.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.591
I should've said
right away...

11:57.680 --> 11:59.592
"Chaz is in the
house and he's..."

12:00.800 --> 12:02.473
But I was afraid,
like you said.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.720
And now...
And now, it's...

12:14.960 --> 12:18.032
Bill, if you think that
makes me guilty
of something, then...

12:18.120 --> 12:21.955
Oh, I want you to throw
the book at me.
Put me in jail.

12:23.320 --> 12:26.757
'Cause I loved her,
you know, Pearl.
Despite all...

12:28.600 --> 12:29.829
She was...

12:32.280 --> 12:33.475
She was my wife.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.192
Lester? Lester!

13:12.000 --> 13:13.559
Lester, what did you do?

13:15.480 --> 13:18.712
Lester!

13:20.040 --> 13:21.394
Lester!

14:04.360 --> 14:06.033
Freeze!
Police officer!

14:33.880 --> 14:35.234
Halt!

14:49.920 --> 14:51.354
She's awake.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.470
Hey.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.269
What happened?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.397
Um, you got shot.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.952
Just go outside
now, okay?
Why?

15:08.360 --> 15:09.350
Just do it.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.989
Did we get him?
Who?

15:20.080 --> 15:21.150
Malvo.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.275
I had him and...

15:25.560 --> 15:27.631
Till this other
fella popped up.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.790
Um...

15:29.480 --> 15:30.914
Look now,
I gotta tell you
something.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.277
Do you know what
happened to
the fella I shot?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.680
Is he...

15:35.800 --> 15:40.511
He's... They got him
upstairs...
in Intensive.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.319
I shot him twice.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.033
Just like they
teach you...

15:49.360 --> 15:50.430
center mass.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.757
And him with
a bazooka.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.200
How the heck
did I do that?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.720
'Cause you're you.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.273
Look, here's the...

16:05.520 --> 16:06.636
Uh...

16:09.000 --> 16:10.150
I shot you.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.512
Well, that don't
make sense.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.312
You... you ran off.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.552
And I couldn't see
anything, you know?
I mean...

16:26.640 --> 16:28.836
not that that's any...

16:28.920 --> 16:32.391
There's... there's no
excuse for it,
for what I did.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.550
You were out there...

16:37.760 --> 16:40.150
alone, needing
back up and I...

16:40.240 --> 16:41.754
What'd I lose?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.070
A spleen.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.150
Oh...

16:47.080 --> 16:48.673
I'll get you a new one,
I swear.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.592
Yeah, you better.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.356
There's gonna
be an inquiry.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.194
I... I was too shook up
at the scene to...

16:58.280 --> 17:00.920
but... I'll...

17:01.040 --> 17:02.838
I'll confess.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.115
They'll probably
take my badge,

17:04.240 --> 17:05.799
but with all
that's happened,

17:05.920 --> 17:07.752
that's likely best.
So...

17:07.920 --> 17:09.434
Come on now.

17:09.520 --> 17:12.479
You said yourself it was...

17:12.560 --> 17:14.790
a blizzard and
whiteout conditions.

17:14.920 --> 17:16.036
And I...

17:16.119 --> 17:18.191
I could have shot you
just as easy.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.272
I... I've just been
messing things up
from the go.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.880
Hey, now.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.473
That's enough of that.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.194
You want some pop
or something...

17:28.280 --> 17:31.193
No, but I want a new spleen,
that's... what I want.

17:31.320 --> 17:35.473
So... you know...
you better get
cracking, mister.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.876
Dad... who's watching
the restaurant?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.753
Screw the
damn restaurant.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.154
I guess we both got
bullet holes now, huh?

18:15.480 --> 18:17.676
You got premium channels?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.999
I'm not sure.
I just woke up.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.958
<i>...this work that
is extremely difficult.</i>

18:23.640 --> 18:26.633
<i>The bark beetle carries
the worm to its nest.</i>

18:29.000 --> 18:30.150
<i>He shoots,
he scores!</i>

18:30.240 --> 18:31.674
Gophers are playing.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.512
If that's what you
wanna watch.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.756
Ben Schmidt says
you put down a guy
with an assault rifle.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.511
Well, he was
pointing it at me.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.000
Yeah.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.040
Proud of you.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.790
Hmm...

20:15.200 --> 20:16.634
All right.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.631
<i>Cleaners?</i>
Hi. Yeah, I got...

20:27.720 --> 20:29.632
<i>How you doin' there then?</i>

20:29.720 --> 20:31.359
I'm real good now.
How are you?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.518
<i>You know, can't complain.
Wife's got a bit of a cold,</i>

20:34.640 --> 20:36.279
<i>but that's life, right?</i>
Sure.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.876
Well, my house needs...

20:40.000 --> 20:44.313
It's... I'm not gonna lie.
It's a real mess.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.437
<i>That's our
bread and butter.</i>

20:46.520 --> 20:48.432
Well, do you fellas
do crime scenes?

20:48.520 --> 20:50.034
<i>Had a breakin, huh?</i>

20:50.160 --> 20:52.550
Yeah, it's a little worse
than a breakin.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.036
<i>A lot of broken glass or...</i>
I'd rather not get...

20:55.160 --> 20:56.594
<i>Sometimes they
defecate in your...</i>

20:56.680 --> 20:58.672
Oh, let's just say
there's a lot of blood.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.560
Hello?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.680
Good!

21:07.760 --> 21:09.672
And twist!

21:09.760 --> 21:12.594
And front!

21:12.680 --> 21:15.514
And side!

21:15.600 --> 21:17.273
And two...

21:17.360 --> 21:20.910
and three and good!

21:21.040 --> 21:22.474
Left arm.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.190
And bend... bend...

21:27.360 --> 21:28.350
bend.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.436
Good!

21:54.880 --> 21:56.633
- It's one story.
- One story...

22:15.160 --> 22:18.437
So I notice you got
a pin on your map in
every state but Georgia.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.637
What the hell do you got
against Georgia?

22:21.760 --> 22:22.750
My first wife.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.957
She was Korean.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.754
She used to spit at me
when we had sex.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.590
Can I sit?

22:31.680 --> 22:34.434
Or... did you wanna
kill me standing?

22:44.320 --> 22:46.437
Two <i>hombres</i> took
a run at me in Duluth.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.034
Mexicans?

22:48.120 --> 22:51.318
That's the wrong
part of the sentence
to be focusing on.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.956
The point is,
they said Fargo
sent them.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.269
So I have two questions.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.510
First...

23:00.120 --> 23:02.316
did you tell these boys
where to find me?

23:04.000 --> 23:04.990
Second...

23:06.320 --> 23:08.630
who do I see
about this in Fargo?

23:10.800 --> 23:11.916
Look...
you know I can't...

23:12.000 --> 23:13.719
Did you put them on me?

23:13.800 --> 23:15.314
No. Of course not.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.631
But you gotta
understand...

23:18.720 --> 23:20.757
this is a business
of relationships.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.230
I can't just...
Of relationships?

23:23.320 --> 23:25.039
Right.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.231
And... well...

23:28.640 --> 23:33.840
it's not my position
professionally to get
involved in squabbles.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.192
Especially not of
a private nature.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.551
How do you
know it's private?

23:43.320 --> 23:48.349
If people are unhappy
with our services...
they call.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.871
A guy screws up,
arrangements are made...

23:53.000 --> 23:54.593
a cash settlement.

23:54.680 --> 23:59.118
If that's not enough,
he'd break a leg
or an arm.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.759
But no calls...

24:00.840 --> 24:02.957
not about you.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.040
So whatever it is...

24:07.120 --> 24:08.520
it's gotta be personal.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.039
It doesn't matter.
It's the principle.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.511
This one calls an ambulance.
That one calls a hearse.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.273
I'm gonna ask you again.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.834
And depending
on the answer...

24:25.920 --> 24:28.640
I pick up this or that.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.232
Who do I talk to in Fargo?

25:19.280 --> 25:20.430
You remember me?

25:27.320 --> 25:28.310
Um...

25:50.800 --> 25:52.029
Dead.

26:03.960 --> 26:04.996
Can...

26:06.640 --> 26:09.519
Can you talk?
Speak, I mean.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.230
Right.
But you...
you read lips?

26:22.480 --> 26:23.675
Okay.

26:24.880 --> 26:25.916
Okay.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.352
You know I'm the one
who shot you, yeah?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.992
Do you remember me
from before?

26:42.200 --> 26:43.190
In Bemidji?

26:44.920 --> 26:46.195
The insurance office.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.759
You were talking to
Lester Nygaard.

26:49.960 --> 26:52.953
It just hit me,
lying in bed thinking
about that...

26:53.040 --> 26:54.110
what happened, you know.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.035
Hold the phone,
I know that fella.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.875
Did you come here
looking for Malvo?

27:01.960 --> 27:03.360
For...

27:06.040 --> 27:07.269
Lorne...

27:10.200 --> 27:13.557
Malvo. Lorne Malvo?

27:13.640 --> 27:16.030
Did Lester tell you
where to find him?

27:20.720 --> 27:24.236
It hurts.
Yeah... mine, too.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.392
You know, it's crazy.
I never shot anyone before.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.560
I'm gathering this wasn't
your first time, though.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.674
Look at us.

27:48.280 --> 27:51.000
And you got a dad
somewhere I bet,
just like me.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.917
And I mean,
what's the point,
you know?

27:57.600 --> 28:00.479
Because here you are and...
your friend is dead.

28:00.600 --> 28:04.150
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life
in jail.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.315
And for what?

28:18.880 --> 28:19.996
Okay.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.316
Okay, Mr. Nygaard.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.960
I gotta ask you to stand
and put your back
to the bars.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.475
Listen, Officer,
this is a huge mistake.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.310
This is a setup.
Sir.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.153
Do you understand?
Evidence has been
planted...

29:12.240 --> 29:13.230
Sir, turn and back
towards me...

29:13.320 --> 29:14.470
It's been falsified
and if I...

29:14.560 --> 29:15.550
...or I'm gonna have
to tase you!

29:15.640 --> 29:17.677
...could just talk to
my brother...

29:20.840 --> 29:22.433
This is a nightmare.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.670
You...

29:26.040 --> 29:27.952
You gotta believe me.
I didn't do these things.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.440
Not for me to say, sir.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.710
Where are you...
Transfer to county.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.753
You'll be there
until the trial...

29:41.960 --> 29:43.679
or until you make bail.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.880
Jeez, Lester.
Oh, hey.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.993
I heard
you got arrested.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.276
Well, you know how it is.
Had a few too many,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.073
slept it off at
the station.

30:20.160 --> 30:22.994
Who can blame you really...
after what you've
been through.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.150
Yeah.
Yeah.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.152
They were real
sweet to me.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.152
I'm the victim here,
you know.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.560
Of course.
So...

30:29.680 --> 30:31.831
what's on the
agenda for today?

30:31.920 --> 30:34.594
I'm ready to go...
you know... start fresh.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.478
I... I can work
late even.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.320
There's nothing at home
but an empty house. So...

30:39.440 --> 30:41.272
Right. Well...

30:42.440 --> 30:44.557
I was just about to
call the widow Hess.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.711
Yeah, her claim's
been denied.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.519
You don't say.
Yeah.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.035
It seems Sam stopped
paying the premium.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.913
A shame, really.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.720
I mean, good for us.
That was a big policy.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.835
Well, she's not gonna be
happy about that.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.758
No, she's not.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.840
Why don't I take that
off your plate?

31:05.960 --> 31:07.314
Really?

31:07.440 --> 31:09.238
I mean, I don't know.
Are you sure
you're ready for...

31:09.320 --> 31:12.358
Look, she can't
shout at me, right?
Not after...

31:12.440 --> 31:13.715
I mean,
we're in the same boat.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.190
So I figure I tell her,
she has a good cry,
and that's that.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.158
Otherwise she's gonna
be all claws out.

31:18.280 --> 31:21.159
That makes sense.
Yeah. Then it's settled.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.159
I'll head over.
You don't wanna just call?

31:24.280 --> 31:25.634
No, in person is better,
I think.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.632
Give her a shoulder,
you know?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.320
Come in.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.320
I... brought you
some flowers.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.151
Oh, thanks,
just put 'em...

32:08.560 --> 32:09.676
What are you...

32:10.480 --> 32:11.800
Oh.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.714
It's making my
head hurt.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.197
This whole case...
all the moving pieces.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.876
I thought I'd put it up,
you know, graphically...

32:21.000 --> 32:22.480
see if things made
much more sense.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.520
I called back to Bemidji
to talk to Bill,
but he's...

32:29.840 --> 32:33.038
I don't know.
Some kid brought a gun
to school or something.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.391
So everyone's kind of
running around.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.552
And to be honest,
everything they said didn't
make much sense anyway.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.109
Who's the
deaf fella then?

32:44.200 --> 32:46.396
Fella upstairs,
tried to murder me
with a bazooka.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.034
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.594
Turns out he can't hear.

32:51.840 --> 32:55.311
And the other fella
with his throat cut,
I'm guessing he translated.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.631
And they're who now?

32:57.720 --> 33:00.679
Well...
that's the thing.

33:02.240 --> 33:06.234
All I can think is...
and maybe this is a stretch,

33:06.360 --> 33:09.159
but heck if I know
any other way to
think about it.

33:09.240 --> 33:12.039
Sam Hess, right?

33:12.120 --> 33:15.397
So... he owns
a trucking company.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.399
And we always thought
he had maybe alleged
ties to organized crime,

33:18.520 --> 33:21.194
this operation
out of Fargo.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.590
So... when Hess
gets killed,

33:23.720 --> 33:26.758
I'm thinking maybe Fargo

33:26.880 --> 33:29.349
sends these two boys
to figure out
what happened.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.477
And how do they
end up here?

33:31.600 --> 33:33.637
Well... follow me.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.153
If we think...

33:37.280 --> 33:38.839
which we do...

33:38.920 --> 33:43.039
...that Lester...
on the day
of the murder...

33:43.120 --> 33:45.077
got bullied by Hess...

33:45.160 --> 33:47.470
and then met Malvo
at the hospital.

33:47.600 --> 33:51.071
Right... and hired Malvo
to kill Hess.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.913
Which he did.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.195
And then...

33:54.280 --> 33:56.795
these two boys come in
from out of town
asking questions.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.435
Get to finding Lester.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.313
And he sends 'em here.

34:05.280 --> 34:09.956
So Lester knew
that Malvo was here...
in Duluth.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.949
It would appear
that way, yeah.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.837
Well, that's...
that's ammunition, right?

34:18.960 --> 34:21.350
I mean,
to go back to Lester.

34:21.480 --> 34:22.800
Oh, yeah. You betcha.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.958
Took forever,
but I got 'em to sign off
on taking you home.

34:30.520 --> 34:31.954
Oh, so you're...

34:33.280 --> 34:37.069
Yeah. Sure that...
Recover at home,
you know, it...

34:37.159 --> 34:39.356
makes sense, sure.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.675
Thanks, Dad.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.199
Well, okay.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.993
I guess I'll see
you later.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.551
Dad, my flowers.
Oh, yeah.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.554
Thanks for these.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.034
He bought me flowers.
You don't say.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.998
Glad you like them.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.629
I'm gonna put them in water
as soon as I get home.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.158
You keep your chin up,
Gus Grimly.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.714
We're winning this thing.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.479
Don't you forget.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.074
Say bye to
Greta for me.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.236
So he's got the stick
in his mouth, right?
Biting down.

35:56.360 --> 36:00.957
And I grab the arrow...
and Craig is in the
car having a giggle.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.311
Thinks the whole
thing's hilarious, which...

36:03.400 --> 36:05.437
That's my cousin
out there, right?

36:05.600 --> 36:08.718
So I slip the knife
out of me boot.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.916
Give him the
old what for.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.191
Held the knife to
his bloody face.

36:12.280 --> 36:14.749
And lunch is over.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.394
I don't know how
they eat that crap
every day.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.396
Speaking of...

36:27.280 --> 36:30.000
What? It's fresh.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.320
Do you know the
conditions of a modern
fast food restaurant?

36:35.440 --> 36:37.238
I'm not just talking
about hygiene.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.640
Get bent.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.474
They did an
experiment once.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.997
Scientist took two
glasses of water...

36:52.120 --> 36:54.157
and he starts
cursing at one,

36:54.240 --> 36:55.310
calling it all
kinds of names.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.153
You're making this up.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.873
I swear to God.
Mmm-mmm.

36:58.960 --> 37:00.519
I swear to God.

37:00.640 --> 37:05.157
He yells at one glass
and then whispers sweet
nothings to the other glass.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.273
Okay? And in one week...
Just stop it.
Just stop it.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.477
But, listen,
a week later...

37:15.320 --> 37:16.515
Can I help you, sir?

37:16.640 --> 37:17.676
Gun!

37:21.200 --> 37:23.112
Is that shots?

37:23.200 --> 37:25.669
Oh, my God! My God!

37:25.800 --> 37:27.393
Drop it!

37:33.680 --> 37:34.716
Call 911!

37:38.720 --> 37:40.757
- Where's the top dog?
- The what?

37:40.840 --> 37:41.956
The boss man.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.872
Third floor.
Private elevator.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.359
Oh, no! No!

37:51.960 --> 37:52.950
He's got a gun!

37:56.680 --> 37:58.353
Freeze, shit bird!

37:59.520 --> 38:00.510
Shit! Ah...

38:01.520 --> 38:04.115
What's the code
for the elevator?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.236
Nine-thirty-three.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.314
He's gotta be in there.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.750
Son of a...

38:24.880 --> 38:25.916
God damn it!

38:26.920 --> 38:27.910
Get him!

38:29.880 --> 38:30.916
Get him! Quick!

38:32.240 --> 38:34.118
Come on, get back!

38:34.240 --> 38:35.356
Get him!

38:41.600 --> 38:43.273
Jesus!

38:43.400 --> 38:45.471
What the... What?
Was that...

38:45.560 --> 38:46.630
Call it in.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.798
Oh. Okay.
Call it in, man.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.991
Your pop is in the way.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.197
Where are you...
Hold on.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.873
Got me all...

38:55.960 --> 38:58.350
Maybe we should get
in the car and then
back up a few feet

38:58.480 --> 38:59.914
and then pull back in
like we just arrived.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.912
Can we just
focus on the...

39:02.000 --> 39:03.798
You need to have
fewer ideas.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.760
Shitballs.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.673
We're in so much...

39:11.920 --> 39:13.957
Okay, let me
do the talking.
Why? I can do the talking.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.634
Because
when you talk...
Back!

39:15.760 --> 39:17.274
...bad shit happens.
Get back!

39:17.360 --> 39:21.912
FBI! We're FBI!
Back! Get back!

39:22.000 --> 39:23.957
Get back, please.
Police on the scene.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.672
What have you guys got?
Really?

39:26.840 --> 39:29.799
No... Well,
he doesn't know...
It's a body. Lock it down.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.989
Multiple gunshots.
The shooter's still
inside the building.

39:33.120 --> 39:34.634
You're gonna need
more patrolmen than this.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.757
Okay, okay.
Okay, we're good.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.240
We're going in. Back us up.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.152
James, you follow us,
come on.
Yes, sir.

39:55.680 --> 39:57.114
It's about time.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.554
I've been calling.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.199
Sorry about the delay.

40:00.320 --> 40:02.391
You know the red tape
on these things.
Mmm-mmm.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.639
Come on in.
Thanks.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.553
You look
real nice today.

40:11.920 --> 40:12.910
Thanks.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.198
You're sweet.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.875
The boys home?
No, thank God.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.515
They have a game.
Good.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.196
Good.

40:25.360 --> 40:28.558
You don't go
then, no?
Are you kidding?

40:28.680 --> 40:30.717
I just stay here trying
to drink enough

40:30.800 --> 40:33.599
so I'm numb by
the time they get home.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.840
Got one of those for me?

40:39.880 --> 40:41.678
Why, Lester...

40:53.960 --> 40:55.792
Hmm?
Sure.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.554
Cheers.
Cheers.

41:01.280 --> 41:03.397
To fresh beginnings.
Yeah.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.390
So it's all set, right?
I'm getting paid?

41:09.800 --> 41:10.870
Um...

41:10.960 --> 41:12.713
Well, they should.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.439
What do you mean
"should"?

41:15.560 --> 41:17.358
When do I get
the money?

41:17.440 --> 41:20.478
Like I said,
there's a few more hoops
on these homicide cases.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.519
We're not just
talking about filing
a death certificate.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.240
I don't think
I'm telling you anything
you don't know

41:26.320 --> 41:27.674
when I say these
insurance companies,

41:27.760 --> 41:30.150
they don't like
writing checks.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.277
But I'm gonna
get it, right?

41:32.400 --> 41:35.677
Well... that is
where a skilled

41:35.760 --> 41:37.399
middleman such as
myself comes in.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.472
You see,
it's all about
knowing who to call.

41:39.600 --> 41:43.833
It's all about
knowing which...
palms to grease...

41:45.080 --> 41:46.594
if you get my meaning.

41:48.920 --> 41:49.910
I...

41:51.240 --> 41:53.357
know a little something...

41:53.440 --> 41:56.433
about greasy palms.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.440
Well, why don't you
and me have another drink?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.680
You can show me that.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.274
Oh, Lester!

42:30.880 --> 42:32.109
Lester.

42:36.040 --> 42:37.190
<i>Slow down, tiger.</i>

42:37.320 --> 42:39.471
You're hurting me.
I'm sorry.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.918
God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.994
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

43:39.800 --> 43:42.759
I should take you home
and put you to bed.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.519
It'll just be a second.
I promise.

44:03.920 --> 44:04.910
Hey.

44:05.040 --> 44:08.590
Oh, my gosh. Are you...
They said you were still...

44:08.720 --> 44:10.313
Oh, the bullet went
clean through.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.119
Doc says take
a few days, rest up.

44:12.240 --> 44:14.277
Otherwise, fine.
Where is everyone?

44:14.400 --> 44:15.436
Celebrating.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.552
We got him...
who killed the Chief.

44:18.440 --> 44:19.669
Lester?

44:19.800 --> 44:21.917
You arrested Lester?
No.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.992
Didn't you hear?
It was his brother...

44:24.080 --> 44:25.878
Chaz... the whole time.

44:25.960 --> 44:29.032
He was having an affair
with the wife.
She broke it off.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.236
What?
Yeah.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.074
Beat her with the hammer,
then shot the Chief.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.277
Lester covered for him.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.039
Bill thinks 'cause of
Chaz's temper...

44:37.120 --> 44:39.112
you know...
the fear factor.

44:40.120 --> 44:41.110
Where...

44:42.480 --> 44:43.709
That's not...

44:45.160 --> 44:46.833
I gotta talk to Bill.
Where's Bill?

44:46.920 --> 44:49.310
Yeah, with the rest...
over at Bernard's.

44:49.400 --> 44:50.993
I'm supposed to go over
after my shift.

44:51.080 --> 44:52.639
Okay, I gotta...

44:53.760 --> 44:55.240
Shouldn't you go home?

45:18.240 --> 45:19.560
You okay, hon?
