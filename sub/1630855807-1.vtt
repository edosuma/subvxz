01:09.699 --> 01:11.659
[CHARLES] Hi. [VERONICA]
- Hey. How's it going?

01:11.785 --> 01:12.668
Good.

01:14.037 --> 01:15.830
Any trouble finding the place?

01:15.955 --> 01:17.082
Just a little.

01:17.999 --> 01:19.709
Well, thanks for coming.

01:29.886 --> 01:33.848
I'm so sorry I asked to meet you so soon.

01:34.891 --> 01:36.768
And specifically at a coffee shop.

01:36.893 --> 01:39.270
You're probably wondering why.

01:41.064 --> 01:43.858
This is the only thing
that helps me stay awake.

01:43.983 --> 01:46.778
I'm the only one taking care of her.

01:47.904 --> 01:48.754
That's okay.

01:48.796 --> 01:50.298
I understand. I just...

01:50.615 --> 01:53.095
didn't have a lot of time to
get ready, so I look like a mess.

01:54.327 --> 01:56.704
It's okay.

01:56.996 --> 01:59.374
I hope I don't come
across as too desperate,

02:00.333 --> 02:02.669
but honestly, I am.

02:03.753 --> 02:06.089
I've been taking care
of my mother for years.

02:06.798 --> 02:10.176
I don't even remember how long it's been.

02:11.678 --> 02:13.638
What did you say was wrong with her again?

02:13.763 --> 02:14.889
Dementia.

02:15.515 --> 02:17.392
It just came with old age.

02:17.851 --> 02:19.686
And then it got worse and worse.

02:21.604 --> 02:24.149
At first, she would
just forget little things

02:24.357 --> 02:26.734
like dates and places.

02:27.569 --> 02:29.612
And then it progressed.

02:30.697 --> 02:34.200
Now, sometimes she
doesn't even know who I am.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.787
It can be pretty harsh.

02:38.830 --> 02:40.957
I can't even imagine
being in that position.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.918
It must be really hard.

02:44.335 --> 02:46.546
Yeah, it's rough.

02:47.463 --> 02:50.425
So why has it been so hard

02:50.550 --> 02:53.678
finding someone to take care of her?

02:55.680 --> 02:58.474
My mom's a handful.

03:00.602 --> 03:04.105
She's just very picky about
the people she chooses, and

03:04.814 --> 03:07.192
I just want the best for her.

03:07.859 --> 03:09.611
But between the constant stress

03:09.736 --> 03:12.739
and being away from home for months on end,

03:13.198 --> 03:14.991
everyone just quits.

03:16.075 --> 03:18.912
What do you mean “being away from home”?

03:20.496 --> 03:22.373
Someone to be with her 24/7.

03:22.540 --> 03:24.167
Living at the house.

03:27.170 --> 03:29.589
I would hate for her to get hurt

03:29.714 --> 03:31.674
or something to happen

03:31.799 --> 03:33.343
to her when she was alone.

03:34.878 --> 03:35.720
Yeah,

03:36.054 --> 03:37.847
of course.

03:41.935 --> 03:42.810
I understand.

03:42.936 --> 03:44.896
You wouldn't want to do this full time.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.274
It would be stupid of
me to ask that of you.

03:48.566 --> 03:50.318
It would be only temporary

03:50.443 --> 03:52.737
until we find someone else.

03:56.032 --> 03:58.826
Look, Mr. Bloom, I don’t know

03:59.035 --> 04:01.704
if this is the kind of job that
I'd be willing to take right now.

04:02.789 --> 04:04.290
It's nothing against you. I just...

04:05.458 --> 04:08.544
I don't think I can do this kind of work.

04:10.046 --> 04:12.590
I'm in a desperate situation, Ms. Gray.

04:13.424 --> 04:14.467
I'll pay anything.

04:14.634 --> 04:16.094
At least for a little while.

04:16.511 --> 04:18.346
To have someone I could trust

04:18.513 --> 04:20.723
to know she's safe.

04:21.349 --> 04:22.558
When Steve recommended you,

04:22.725 --> 04:24.894
I knew I could trust you.

04:27.522 --> 04:29.399
Just think about it.

04:29.565 --> 04:31.317
Please.

04:38.074 --> 04:41.035
[FOOTSTEPS LEAVING]

04:48.918 --> 04:50.545
[VOICE ON PHONE] Hello? - Hey, Mom.

04:50.670 --> 04:52.422
I just wanted to let you know I'm leaving.

04:52.797 --> 04:54.966
They got here a little bit
earlier than I expected.

04:55.383 --> 04:56.718
[MOM ON PHONE] What? Already?

04:57.093 --> 04:58.594
[MOM ON PHONE] I thought
you were leaving at 12.

04:58.636 --> 05:00.680
No, I know. I thought they were.

05:00.888 --> 05:02.515
They just got here a little bit early.

05:02.765 --> 05:04.725
[MOM ON PHONE] Can't
they just wait a bit longer?

05:04.934 --> 05:06.269
No, it's fine.

05:06.394 --> 05:07.687
I'll call you later, okay?

05:07.812 --> 05:08.646
[MOM] Okay.

05:08.771 --> 05:09.689
I love you. Okay.

05:09.814 --> 05:12.150
I love you, too. Bye.

05:33.546 --> 05:34.839
Need any help?

05:35.256 --> 05:38.092
Got it. Thanks.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.278
You didn't have to lie to her.

05:57.904 --> 05:59.322
You don't know my mom.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.491
She worries too much.

06:02.909 --> 06:06.371
I can wait for her if it'll
give her some peace of mind.

06:06.537 --> 06:08.122
No, that's okay.

06:08.748 --> 06:10.249
We can go.

06:11.626 --> 06:14.087
Listen, Ms. Gray,

06:14.921 --> 06:16.422
it's not going to be that bad.

06:16.547 --> 06:17.440
Really.

06:17.757 --> 06:21.677
It's not the fancy job you
told your mom about. But...

06:22.678 --> 06:24.972
we're going to take care of you.

06:25.598 --> 06:28.267
And I didn't mean for
it to sound like that.

06:29.894 --> 06:32.730
I do appreciate the opportunity.

06:33.439 --> 06:35.024
And I appreciate you coming.

06:35.191 --> 06:36.692
I really do.

06:37.026 --> 06:39.779
But at least for my mom's sake.

06:41.406 --> 06:43.616
Try and enjoy yourself.

06:45.868 --> 06:48.830
(truck engine starts)

06:56.963 --> 07:02.969
(creepy old music)

08:28.137 --> 08:31.098
(music fades)

08:34.936 --> 08:37.897
(truck shuts off)

09:01.921 --> 09:05.258
Are you okay?

09:16.519 --> 09:18.938
Welcome to our humble home.

09:19.522 --> 09:22.191
C’mon, c’mon.

09:45.506 --> 09:49.176
It's a little dustier than I like,
but I'm sure that will change soon.

09:49.885 --> 09:51.220
Absolutely.

09:52.013 --> 09:54.056
It is just about lunchtime.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.851
I'm sure Mrs. Bloom will
be anxious to meet you.

09:57.059 --> 09:59.145
Are you ready to meet her?

09:59.478 --> 10:00.855
It would be my pleasure.

10:01.647 --> 10:03.065
I'll be right back.

10:07.653 --> 10:10.615
(tense violin music)

10:43.981 --> 10:46.442
Hi, Mrs. Bloom. I'm Veronica.

10:47.276 --> 10:51.197
Mom, this is Miss Gray.
She'll be your new caregiver.

10:51.947 --> 10:53.658
You'll have to forgive me, Miss Gray.

10:54.659 --> 10:56.702
I have not been feeling very well.

10:57.578 --> 10:59.664
No need to apologize, Mrs. Bloom.

11:00.039 --> 11:02.667
It's such a pleasure to finally meet you.

11:05.461 --> 11:06.671
I've heard so much about you.

11:07.171 --> 11:08.089
Really?

11:08.923 --> 11:11.133
And what exactly have you heard?

11:11.759 --> 11:14.512
You would be stuck out here
with a demented old lady?

11:15.888 --> 11:18.057
No, not at all.

11:19.016 --> 11:21.143
I'm not as bad as my
son makes me out to be.

11:21.268 --> 11:22.853
I assure you,

11:23.270 --> 11:25.856
I may be stuck in this chair, but

11:25.981 --> 11:28.317
my mind is sharper than you may think.

11:28.609 --> 11:31.237
Come on, Mom. I didn't
say anything about you.

11:32.279 --> 11:35.991
Veronica really wanted to come.
She was very excited to meet you.

11:36.784 --> 11:38.369
She's going to love it out here.

11:38.494 --> 11:41.080
Aren't you, Mrs. Gray?

11:41.372 --> 11:42.373
Of course.

11:43.582 --> 11:45.459
Absolutely.

11:47.753 --> 11:50.673
Would you like to join
us for lunch, Miss Gray?

11:55.386 --> 11:59.432
I think the worst part of being bedridden
all these years is eating Charles's food.

11:59.598 --> 12:01.267
(laughs) Come on...

12:01.392 --> 12:02.935
It's not that bad.

12:03.060 --> 12:07.148
I cannot wait until I am
strong enough to cook again.

12:07.314 --> 12:09.734
Charles, would you say grace, dear?

12:09.859 --> 12:11.527
Of course.

12:15.781 --> 12:16.907
Bless us, oh Lord.

12:17.032 --> 12:21.454
And these gifts we’re about to receive
from thy bounty in Christ, our Lord.

12:23.247 --> 12:25.499
Amen.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.794
So I take it you guys are Catholic?

12:30.129 --> 12:31.255
What gave us away.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.841
For the rosary around your neck?

12:33.966 --> 12:36.051
The praying for the food.

12:38.012 --> 12:39.722
Are you religious, Miss Gray?

12:40.264 --> 12:44.101
I was raised Catholic,
but I don't practice it.

12:48.314 --> 12:51.108
It's Veronica, isn't it? - Yes, ma’am.

12:52.401 --> 12:54.111
Do you mind if I call
you by your first name?

12:54.153 --> 12:56.697
No, not at all.

12:57.573 --> 13:00.576
Where are you from, Veronica?

13:00.826 --> 13:01.744
Criddick.

13:02.244 --> 13:04.413
It's a very small town around 3 hours away.

13:05.456 --> 13:08.083
There's probably more
cows than people there.

13:11.837 --> 13:15.508
Do you have anyone here
in Mintown, family-wise?

13:16.050 --> 13:17.676
Um, just my mom.

13:17.802 --> 13:19.261
We lived with my uncle, but

13:19.386 --> 13:21.347
he passed away not too long ago.

13:21.472 --> 13:23.641
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:23.766 --> 13:24.850
My condolences.

13:24.975 --> 13:26.769
Thank you.

13:28.229 --> 13:30.439
I really appreciate
the opportunity, though.

13:30.898 --> 13:32.316
That's right.

13:32.525 --> 13:35.277
Charles mentioned that
this is only temporary.

13:35.402 --> 13:36.779
I understand.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.448
It's a shame, though.

13:39.573 --> 13:41.826
I really feel like we could get along.

13:42.701 --> 13:44.787
I would love to have you here indefinitely.

13:45.746 --> 13:47.581
How's the food?

13:47.706 --> 13:48.499
It's great.

13:48.624 --> 13:51.001
Thank you.

13:57.967 --> 14:02.221
Um, I haven't had
service since we got here.

14:02.346 --> 14:04.974
You're not going to get any
service anywhere around here.

14:05.099 --> 14:07.560
We are in the middle of nowhere.

14:09.937 --> 14:11.814
I was hoping I could call my mom.

14:12.231 --> 14:14.275
You know, let her know
I made it, and I'm safe.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.068
I don't want her to get worried.

14:16.193 --> 14:18.195
You know how parents can be.

14:20.865 --> 14:23.951
Oh, you're more than
welcome to use our phone, dear.

14:24.076 --> 14:26.495
It's in the hallway
right where you came in.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.705
Hanging on the wall.

14:27.955 --> 14:28.847
Thank you.

14:34.461 --> 14:36.755

14:41.510 --> 14:42.803
[VOICEMAIL] Your call has been forwarded

14:42.845 --> 14:44.680
[VOICEMAIL] to an automatic voice message.

14:45.139 --> 14:47.516
[VOICEMAIL] At the tone,
please record your message.

14:48.434 --> 14:49.560
Hey, Mom, it's me.

14:49.685 --> 14:51.103
I just wanted to let you know

14:51.228 --> 14:52.688
that I made it and I'm safe.

14:52.813 --> 14:54.648
I know how worried
you get when I don't call,

14:55.399 --> 14:57.276
but I'll be at this number
for the next few days.

14:57.318 --> 14:59.737
If you need anything,
you can just call me here.

15:00.529 --> 15:03.991
Um, anyways, I'll talk to you soon.

15:04.825 --> 15:06.201
I love you.

15:14.251 --> 15:15.628
Were you able to call?

15:17.338 --> 15:18.339
Sorry.

15:18.547 --> 15:20.507
Didn't mean to startle you.

15:21.008 --> 15:22.343
Were you able to call?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.428
Yeah, it went to voicemail.

15:24.553 --> 15:26.055
She must've been busy.

15:29.975 --> 15:32.144
Mrs. Bloom is asking for you.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.521
Of course.

15:40.027 --> 15:41.904
(tense music builds up)

15:44.698 --> 15:46.617
Did you enjoy dinner, dear?

15:47.159 --> 15:48.744
Yes. Thank you for having me.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.704
You’re welcome.

15:54.249 --> 15:56.502
I got you some clothes.

15:57.419 --> 15:59.588
I thought it'd be more comfortable.

16:00.839 --> 16:01.715
Thank you.

16:02.508 --> 16:04.134
You’re welcome.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.889
They're definitely more modest.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.060
It's a beautiful dress.

16:15.145 --> 16:16.981
Belonged to my granddaughter.

16:19.692 --> 16:22.152
I think it would be lovely on you.

16:22.945 --> 16:25.155
You remind me of her.

16:37.835 --> 16:40.087
I made you a list.

16:42.047 --> 16:44.967
Here's some things you can
do when you get a chance.

16:50.431 --> 16:52.141
It's chores you can work on.

16:53.225 --> 16:54.560
Of course

16:56.061 --> 16:58.063
I'll take care of it.

17:02.776 --> 17:05.946
Would you hand me the
bell that's over on the table?

17:11.285 --> 17:12.286
Thank you.

17:17.499 --> 17:18.709
You can go.

17:19.626 --> 17:22.546
I’ll just ring the bell if I need anything.

17:36.351 --> 17:37.853
Mr. Bloom.

17:48.781 --> 17:50.866
Mr. Bloom.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.252
[low pitch ominous tone]

18:14.223 --> 18:17.184
[ominous tone builds]

18:24.566 --> 18:27.444
It was supposed to rain today,

18:27.903 --> 18:30.781
but the rain...

18:30.989 --> 18:32.032
It's not here.

18:32.199 --> 18:34.159
But it was supposed to rain today.

18:34.827 --> 18:37.246
Oh, yeah. It's still sunny out.

18:38.997 --> 18:41.667
Do you happen to know where Charles is?

18:43.293 --> 18:45.170
Charles isn’t here.

18:45.963 --> 18:46.922
He left?

18:47.506 --> 18:49.716
Of course, he went
home to be with his family.

18:52.386 --> 18:54.680
Was there something that you needed?

18:55.264 --> 18:59.685
Yeah. I just wanted to go
over a few things with him.

18:59.977 --> 19:02.187
You could speak to me, dear.

19:05.065 --> 19:08.152
I was just wondering about
the sleeping arrangements.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.445
Just curious.

19:10.571 --> 19:12.489
I'm so sorry. Of course. I'll show you.

19:18.370 --> 19:19.830
This is the room.

19:20.372 --> 19:23.125
It's not a five star hotel,
but I'm certain it will do.

19:23.876 --> 19:25.836
We saved it just for you.

19:26.879 --> 19:27.880
It's lovely.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.214
Thank you.

19:31.925 --> 19:35.095
Oh, you can use the
wardrobe however you'd like.

19:37.848 --> 19:40.184
I apologize for the two beds.

19:41.101 --> 19:43.145
We used to have more people in the house.

19:43.645 --> 19:44.771
No worries.

19:44.897 --> 19:47.107
I'm sure I'll use both of them.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.529
Please don't make a mess.

19:52.696 --> 19:55.616
I won’t. I promise.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.661
The bathroom is down the hall to the right.

20:00.078 --> 20:03.123
And help yourself to
anything at all in the kitchen.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.501
I want you to feel at home.

20:07.252 --> 20:09.588
Thank you.

20:10.172 --> 20:11.840
I'm certain that you are tired.

20:11.965 --> 20:14.384
So take this evening,

20:14.968 --> 20:16.970
get unpacked, settle

20:17.095 --> 20:19.097
in, and we'll start in the morning.

20:19.681 --> 20:20.849
Thank you.

20:20.974 --> 20:22.935
I really appreciate it.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.061
Of course.

20:25.145 --> 20:26.688
Good night.

20:31.735 --> 20:34.696
[creepy old music fades in]

20:42.329 --> 20:45.290
[old music continues]

21:11.733 --> 21:14.695
[music echoes and fades]

21:20.659 --> 21:23.620
(low pitch droning fades in)

21:33.630 --> 21:36.008
[birds chirping]

21:37.134 --> 21:40.095
[clicking sound]

21:59.489 --> 22:02.451
[clicking sound continues]

22:14.588 --> 22:17.758
You must be pretty thirsty
working out here all day in the sun.

22:23.513 --> 22:26.099
You don't want it.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.480
I'm not very thirsty.

22:33.523 --> 22:35.984
How's your hand?

22:37.277 --> 22:39.446
(garden shears cutting)

22:41.406 --> 22:42.699
Seriously?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.118
You're not going to answer.

22:46.703 --> 22:48.497
My hand is fine, Miss Gray.

22:51.583 --> 22:52.959
How do you know my name?

22:54.294 --> 22:56.254
(eerie music fades in)

22:56.922 --> 22:59.132
You’re all they've talked about...

22:59.466 --> 23:01.051
for a long time.

23:01.927 --> 23:04.763
How could I not know the perfect Veronica?

23:10.602 --> 23:13.980
What do you mean “for a long time”?

23:18.110 --> 23:19.611
Mr. Bloom...

23:21.363 --> 23:23.698
is very happy he found you.

23:25.409 --> 23:28.036
His family is very fond of you.

23:29.788 --> 23:31.498
They've been looking for you

23:31.623 --> 23:34.000
for a very long time.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.214
Yeah, well I'm glad I could be of help.

23:40.590 --> 23:42.008
What's your name?

23:44.469 --> 23:45.887
Joe.

23:47.931 --> 23:50.767
How long have you worked
for the Bloom family, Joe?

23:52.519 --> 23:54.521
(shears clip) (bush rustles)

23:55.230 --> 23:57.232
It's been a while.

23:58.275 --> 23:59.901
Few years.

24:01.111 --> 24:03.530
How do you like it?

24:08.201 --> 24:11.163
(tense music)

24:21.214 --> 24:24.217
Thank you for the water, Miss
Gray. You'll want to go inside now.

24:24.342 --> 24:25.742
I was just about to make breakfast.

24:25.802 --> 24:28.180
Do you want to come in and j... No.

24:29.973 --> 24:31.433
[VERONICA MUTTERS] Whatever.

24:33.727 --> 24:34.936
[JOE] This house.

24:36.313 --> 24:38.148
I've never been inside.

24:40.775 --> 24:42.444
There is something very strange

24:42.569 --> 24:44.779
going on in this house.

24:45.989 --> 24:47.908
I don't know what it is.

24:48.825 --> 24:50.994
But if I were you?

24:52.037 --> 24:53.788
I wouldn’t stay long.

24:55.624 --> 24:57.292
There were others,

24:58.376 --> 24:59.878
just like you.

25:00.086 --> 25:02.005
What do you mean “just like me”?

25:03.006 --> 25:05.050
(tense music builds)

25:06.301 --> 25:08.220
You should ask Mrs. Bloom.

25:09.429 --> 25:12.390
(dark music swells)

25:22.776 --> 25:24.611
(door closes)

25:25.362 --> 25:28.323
(loud percussive sounds)

25:43.046 --> 25:44.214
(pan rattles)

25:48.426 --> 25:51.388
(egg sizzles)

26:03.984 --> 26:05.694
How was your night?

26:06.987 --> 26:08.071
It was okay.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.240
Couldn't really sleep.

26:11.199 --> 26:12.826
Probably the change of environment.

26:13.994 --> 26:14.828
How was yours?

26:15.537 --> 26:16.746
Same as usual.

26:17.414 --> 26:19.332
I don't sleep, but

26:19.457 --> 26:21.209
I'm used to it.

26:23.211 --> 26:26.172
(birds chirping outside)

26:28.592 --> 26:29.759
Ms. Gray,

26:30.176 --> 26:32.304
Would you help me with
something in the bedroom?

26:32.554 --> 26:34.139
I've a lot of things to pack.

26:34.264 --> 26:35.974
Of course.

26:37.684 --> 26:40.645
(birds chirping outside)

26:41.688 --> 26:43.273
Right now.

26:44.274 --> 26:46.443
Oh, of course. I’m sorry.

26:46.818 --> 26:49.654
There's the suitcase, dear.

26:50.905 --> 26:51.740
Thank you.

26:51.865 --> 26:53.992
Now, I already have some clothes

26:54.117 --> 26:55.535
piled up in the cabinet.

26:55.744 --> 26:57.495
If you'll get those for me, please.

26:58.038 --> 26:59.372
Where are you going, Mrs. Bloom?

26:59.998 --> 27:01.875
I'm packing

27:02.000 --> 27:04.294
so that I can go home.

27:05.629 --> 27:07.839
Home? - Yes.

27:08.923 --> 27:11.509
Mrs. Bloom, do you know where you are?

27:12.427 --> 27:13.595
Yes, of course.

27:14.095 --> 27:15.805
I'm at the university.

27:16.348 --> 27:18.433
I have to pack so that I can go home

27:18.808 --> 27:20.393
to my parents.

27:20.810 --> 27:22.062
Mrs. Bloom,

27:22.437 --> 27:23.730
you are home.

27:24.481 --> 27:26.941
We just ate breakfast around...

27:27.984 --> 27:29.069
10 minutes ago,

27:29.194 --> 27:31.029
in your kitchen.

27:32.447 --> 27:33.782
No...

27:34.991 --> 27:37.952
(eerie violins)

27:39.496 --> 27:41.873
I- I don't know where I am.

27:43.208 --> 27:44.918
[stammering] I-I have to get out of here.

27:45.126 --> 27:46.711
Please. Please. Please help me pack.

27:46.961 --> 27:49.047
Mrs. Bloom, you are home.
You can't go anywhere.

27:49.172 --> 27:51.925
You can't tell me where I can go.

27:53.093 --> 27:54.052
Stop laughing!

27:54.260 --> 27:55.136
I'm not laughing.

27:55.220 --> 27:57.305
Not you! Him!

27:58.306 --> 27:59.891
He wants to see me suffer!

28:00.058 --> 28:01.601
Who are you talking to?

28:02.727 --> 28:04.187
I’m just in this house!
Leave me alone, Henry.

28:04.229 --> 28:05.563
Leave me alone!

28:05.689 --> 28:07.857
Go away, Henry! Go away!

28:08.983 --> 28:10.944
Just leave me alone!

28:12.070 --> 28:15.115
I don’t mean-I-Please make him
go away. Please ask him to leave.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.283
Please make him go!

28:18.576 --> 28:20.370
(heavy breathing)

28:20.662 --> 28:21.830
Hey, look at me.

28:22.664 --> 28:24.124
It's okay.

28:24.332 --> 28:26.543
I closed the door. He can't hurt you.

28:27.627 --> 28:28.837
It's okay.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.642
Why don't we sit you
in bed for a little bit?

28:35.760 --> 28:37.721
It'll help you calm down.

28:39.764 --> 28:40.890
He'll be back.

28:41.224 --> 28:42.517
You just need to relax.

28:42.642 --> 28:43.643
It's okay.

28:44.728 --> 28:46.479
No one's there.

28:52.360 --> 28:55.321
(ominous chimes)

28:59.492 --> 29:02.454
(door closes)

29:14.299 --> 29:15.967
(door opens)

29:16.718 --> 29:18.678
Mr. Bloom?

29:27.896 --> 29:29.522
Mr. Bloom?

29:30.064 --> 29:31.733
(floorboard creaks)

29:36.112 --> 29:37.530
Can I help you?

29:38.156 --> 29:39.324
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:39.449 --> 29:40.700
I didn't mean to scare you.

29:40.825 --> 29:43.953
The front door was open,
so I just helped myself in.

29:45.121 --> 29:47.832
Okay.

29:49.501 --> 29:50.919
Are you the new caregiver?

29:51.294 --> 29:53.254
Yes, that's me. And you are?

29:53.797 --> 29:54.714
Oh, I'm Emily.

29:54.839 --> 29:55.757
Emily Bloom.

29:55.882 --> 29:57.550
Mrs. Bloom's granddaughter.

29:57.967 --> 30:00.470
Sorry. I wasn't told anyone
would be stopping by today.

30:00.595 --> 30:02.514
Oh, no worries. I didn't
mean to startle you.

30:02.639 --> 30:05.475
I just like to come by every now
and then just to check in on things.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.018
See how Grandma is doing.

30:07.685 --> 30:09.062
So how is she doing?

30:09.437 --> 30:10.313
She's okay.

30:10.855 --> 30:13.358
She is sleeping right now. Do
you want me to go wake her?

30:13.650 --> 30:15.777
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

30:16.277 --> 30:17.570
Just tell her I dropped by.

30:17.695 --> 30:18.563
I will.

30:19.072 --> 30:20.907
So how is it going with her?

30:21.032 --> 30:22.367
She giving you any trouble yet?

30:23.076 --> 30:24.035
So far, so good.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.328
No complaints.

30:25.620 --> 30:29.040
Oh, I'm glad. My grandmother
can be a handful...

30:29.582 --> 30:30.391
at times.

30:30.816 --> 30:33.819
Yes, I'm aware of that.

30:40.552 --> 30:42.178
Well, I'm glad to have met you.

30:42.303 --> 30:44.472
I'll have to swing by another
time when she’s awake.

30:44.681 --> 30:46.724
But I have some things I
have to talk to her about, so...

30:46.766 --> 30:48.059
I have to get going.

30:48.184 --> 30:49.561
Sounds good.

30:55.275 --> 30:57.235
I like your dress, Veronica.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.862
How do you know my name?

30:59.487 --> 31:01.531
I'll call next time.

31:23.219 --> 31:26.180
(footsteps on gravel)

31:51.122 --> 31:52.498
What the he...

32:02.050 --> 32:05.011
(sinister male and female voices echo)

32:18.775 --> 32:25.323
(suspenseful orchestra music)

32:41.839 --> 32:43.591
(panting)

32:56.980 --> 33:01.401
(percussive strings)

33:03.486 --> 33:08.992
(bell rings)

33:21.045 --> 33:22.255
Where were you?

33:22.380 --> 33:23.965
Did you not hear my bell?

33:24.090 --> 33:26.551
Sorry, I heard it. I was outside.

33:28.302 --> 33:29.679
You left the house?

33:29.804 --> 33:33.266
What if I needed you?
Well, what if I was hurt?

33:33.391 --> 33:35.309
And where were you? Nowhere to be found!

33:35.476 --> 33:38.354
It was just for a few minutes, that's all.

33:39.355 --> 33:41.774
Oh, no, you can't do that.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.193
You cannot leave the house.

33:44.777 --> 33:47.030
I didn't know I wasn't
allowed to leave the house.

33:47.822 --> 33:49.657
I mean, I finished all my work.

33:50.116 --> 33:51.951
Didn't Charles tell you?

33:52.452 --> 33:53.411
I mean, he said

33:53.745 --> 33:55.945
I had to be here to take
care of you, but he didn't say

33:56.164 --> 33:58.041
I couldn't leave the house.

33:59.375 --> 34:01.586
Let me be very clear, Miss Gray.

34:02.253 --> 34:04.297
If you leave this house again,

34:04.464 --> 34:06.632
you're fired.

34:10.261 --> 34:10.970
Okay,

34:11.429 --> 34:12.764
Got it.

34:18.853 --> 34:21.814
(crickets chirping)

34:29.697 --> 34:32.658
(dishes rattling)

34:34.368 --> 34:36.162
I'm sorry.

34:41.959 --> 34:44.337
I just want you to know I’m sorry.

34:46.339 --> 34:47.548
It's okay.

34:50.802 --> 34:52.887
I’ve been stuck in this house for so long.

34:53.012 --> 34:56.015
Sometimes I just lose my mind.

34:57.683 --> 34:59.936
I just want to get out.

35:00.770 --> 35:03.064
Maybe tomorrow we
could go for a walk outside.

35:03.606 --> 35:05.066
See the trees.

35:06.192 --> 35:07.860
That would be nice.

35:08.194 --> 35:10.530
I haven't seen them in a while.

35:14.242 --> 35:15.785
Ow!

35:17.495 --> 35:18.371
Are you okay?

35:18.496 --> 35:19.914
Yeah, I just.

35:20.373 --> 35:22.500
I just cut myself a bit.

35:23.668 --> 35:24.669
I’m fine.

35:25.837 --> 35:30.258
There is a first aid kit
in the cabinet over there.

35:34.262 --> 35:37.223
(crickets chirping)

35:38.516 --> 35:41.477
(creepy high pitch violin music)

35:58.161 --> 36:01.122
(music stops)

36:12.008 --> 36:14.969
(low pitch drone)

36:20.766 --> 36:23.728
(light footsteps)

36:46.959 --> 36:49.921
(door creaks)

36:52.173 --> 36:55.134
(cell phone ringing)

37:04.435 --> 37:07.396
(suspenseful percussion music)

37:23.496 --> 37:26.457
(birds chirping)

37:35.508 --> 37:37.009
Are you ready for today?

37:38.177 --> 37:39.762
What happens today?

37:40.888 --> 37:42.014
The walk.

37:42.306 --> 37:44.517
You said you’d take me.

37:46.519 --> 37:47.979
I don't think I can today.

37:48.688 --> 37:49.814
I don’t feel well.

37:51.232 --> 37:53.317
I think I might need to go back to bed.

37:54.110 --> 37:55.194
What's wrong?

37:57.196 --> 37:59.365
I feel drained,

37:59.490 --> 38:02.618
tired, can't sleep.

38:03.744 --> 38:05.162
This morning when I woke up,

38:05.997 --> 38:08.958
I had bruises all over my arm.

38:12.003 --> 38:14.005
You probably just hit
yourself on something.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.799
It's an old house, Miss
Gray. You have to be careful.

38:17.258 --> 38:19.677
I think I saw Charles.

38:20.636 --> 38:22.346
I think he took my phone.

38:23.556 --> 38:24.390
Charles?

38:24.974 --> 38:25.766
Yes.

38:26.642 --> 38:28.894
I saw him outside of my window last night.

38:29.645 --> 38:30.980
He had my phone.

38:32.189 --> 38:34.525
Charles is home with his family, dear.

38:36.777 --> 38:37.528
I saw him.

38:38.696 --> 38:40.781
I'd like my phone back, please.

38:41.782 --> 38:42.616
Dear.

38:42.908 --> 38:45.244
Charles has no reason to take your phone,

38:45.995 --> 38:48.372
or to be hanging around here at night.

38:49.707 --> 38:51.834
I'm sure you'll find your phone somewhere.

38:53.044 --> 38:54.364
Are you done with your breakfast?

39:04.472 --> 39:05.356
(birds chirping)

39:05.806 --> 39:06.640
(door opens)

39:12.313 --> 39:15.274
(ominous music)

39:39.256 --> 39:40.841
(haunting voices whisper)

39:50.434 --> 39:53.396
(crickets chirping)

40:09.453 --> 40:11.373
(creepy 1920’s music
starts playing in distance)

40:12.289 --> 40:13.416
Hello.

40:14.083 --> 40:17.044
(woman laughing quietly)

40:24.593 --> 40:27.555
(woman coughing)

40:30.266 --> 40:31.308
(doorknob rattles)

40:35.479 --> 40:38.441
(woman coughing)

40:43.320 --> 40:44.947
(dishes clatter)

40:59.462 --> 41:00.963
How was your day, dear?

41:03.549 --> 41:04.408
What?

41:05.634 --> 41:07.511
That's how the days here tend to be.

41:08.345 --> 41:09.805
You will get used to it.

41:12.016 --> 41:13.851
Have you lived here for a long time?

41:16.020 --> 41:17.438
I'm afraid so.

41:18.939 --> 41:20.608
This house is all I know.

41:23.068 --> 41:24.737
Don't forget behind the nightstand.

41:31.285 --> 41:33.537
Mrs. Bloom, can I ask you a question?

41:34.747 --> 41:36.040
Of course.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.710
The other caregiver.

41:40.503 --> 41:42.087
What happened to her?

41:43.172 --> 41:45.174
Joe mentioned something about her.

41:46.342 --> 41:47.301
She just left.

41:47.843 --> 41:49.094
We don't know why.

41:51.347 --> 41:52.264
She just...

41:53.015 --> 41:54.058
left?

41:54.517 --> 41:57.102
Yes, she just got up one day and left.

42:00.564 --> 42:03.901
Is that why Charles
insisted on driving me here?

42:04.944 --> 42:07.154
So I couldn't just up and leave?

42:07.488 --> 42:09.365
Of course not.

42:10.074 --> 42:11.617
That was common courtesy.

42:17.248 --> 42:20.793
This house is not for everyone, Miss Gray.

42:21.544 --> 42:23.712
Not everyone is welcomed here.

42:25.548 --> 42:27.716
Should count yourself lucky.

42:34.557 --> 42:36.141
(footsteps above)

42:36.308 --> 42:37.643
Did you hear that?

42:38.811 --> 42:40.604
Sounded like footsteps.

42:43.023 --> 42:46.026
Just let it go, Miss Gray. Please.

42:47.653 --> 42:50.322
Mrs. Bloom, who's in the attic?

42:56.745 --> 42:58.706
We're finished for tonight.

42:59.456 --> 43:01.292
Go to bed, please.

43:08.966 --> 43:09.967
(door closes)

43:39.622 --> 43:42.583
(grunts)

43:56.347 --> 43:57.598
(sighs)

44:02.019 --> 44:04.980
(chuckles)

44:11.737 --> 44:12.905
(sighs)

44:14.782 --> 44:16.742
It’s not right, what you're doing.

44:16.950 --> 44:18.535
You should tell her.

44:20.162 --> 44:22.414
(ominous music)

44:22.915 --> 44:24.291
You wouldn't understand, Henry.

44:25.834 --> 44:27.586
But it's wrong.

44:30.923 --> 44:32.591
You couldn't convince her.

44:33.092 --> 44:36.303
What makes you think you can convince me?

44:37.721 --> 44:39.598
Figured I’d try.

44:41.892 --> 44:43.352
I'm too late, aren’t I?

44:44.937 --> 44:47.147
You get in bed all on your own.

44:49.858 --> 44:52.152
You're not scared of me anymore, are you?

44:55.197 --> 44:56.949
It's already started.

44:57.658 --> 45:00.869
There's nothing you can do to stop it.

45:05.082 --> 45:08.585
If you'll excuse me, I need to pray.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.973
Our father,

45:22.015 --> 45:24.852
who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

45:31.859 --> 45:33.444
Thy Kingdom come,

45:33.986 --> 45:35.988
Thy will be done.

45:49.376 --> 45:52.337
(old choral music)

46:33.837 --> 46:36.799
(old choral music continues)

48:13.979 --> 48:15.147
Good morning.

48:17.274 --> 48:18.233
Good morning.

48:19.318 --> 48:20.527
You're up early.

48:21.445 --> 48:22.487
Couldn't sleep.

48:23.113 --> 48:24.740
I figured I should just get up.

48:26.283 --> 48:28.410
Very eager to get to work.

48:30.287 --> 48:32.664
Anything to make the day go by faster.

48:36.877 --> 48:39.838
(birds chirping)

48:41.882 --> 48:43.091
What are you praying for?

48:43.634 --> 48:45.302
I pray for many things.

48:46.470 --> 48:49.264
Right now, I am praying for patience.

48:52.225 --> 48:53.268
Does it work?

48:54.978 --> 48:56.688
Praying? - Yes.

48:56.813 --> 48:58.523
Oh, I like to think it does.

49:03.362 --> 49:05.113
But you come out here to pray.

49:09.326 --> 49:11.244
I like seeing the trees.

49:12.037 --> 49:13.497
Being in nature

49:13.622 --> 49:16.249
just helps me to relax.

49:22.297 --> 49:25.258
Do you believe in spirits, Mrs. Bloom?

49:27.552 --> 49:28.595
Excuse me?

49:30.305 --> 49:31.807
This house.

49:32.849 --> 49:38.355
Have you ever seen or
experienced anything weird?

49:39.648 --> 49:41.858
Is there something you
want to speak with me about?

49:42.776 --> 49:45.612
Ever since I got here, I've had this...

49:45.737 --> 49:48.407
feeling of being watched.

49:50.909 --> 49:52.619
This gut feeling of

49:52.953 --> 49:54.496
being in danger.

49:56.581 --> 49:58.417
I had no idea you felt that way.

49:58.542 --> 49:59.835
I'm so sorry.

50:01.211 --> 50:03.630
I haven't been able to sleep.

50:04.631 --> 50:06.049
I’ve been seeing things.

50:07.050 --> 50:08.802
Last night, I felt

50:09.052 --> 50:12.097
a presence in my room.

50:13.682 --> 50:15.100
Presence?

50:16.351 --> 50:17.227
Yeah.

50:17.811 --> 50:20.772
I was like awake but
asleep at the same time.

50:21.732 --> 50:24.026
That was right next to my bed.

50:24.484 --> 50:26.194
I could feel it.

50:26.862 --> 50:28.989
That must've been a dream.

50:29.573 --> 50:32.034
We're safe here, Ms. Gray.

50:32.159 --> 50:34.619
No one would ever harm you,

50:36.079 --> 50:37.998
but a horrible nightmare.

50:42.419 --> 50:44.296
It felt different.

50:45.964 --> 50:48.175
This morning, I woke up with more bruises.

50:49.468 --> 50:52.137
I'm 100% sure this wasn't me.

50:57.559 --> 50:59.478
I know something that will help.

51:39.851 --> 51:41.895
It will help with the bruising, dear.

51:43.647 --> 51:46.233
And the feeling of nausea.

51:56.201 --> 51:57.369
(old phone rings)

51:59.121 --> 52:00.288
(old phone rings)

52:01.665 --> 52:02.457
Hello?

52:03.458 --> 52:05.001
[WOMAN ON PHONE] Hello? Veronica?

52:05.710 --> 52:06.586
Yes.

52:07.712 --> 52:09.152
[WOMAN ON PHONE] Hey, this is Emily.

52:09.214 --> 52:11.007
Just wanted to see if
I could stop by today.

52:11.133 --> 52:12.551
I wanted to see Grandma.

52:13.051 --> 52:13.969
Of course.

52:14.094 --> 52:16.134
She's in the kitchen right
now cooking me her soup.

52:16.221 --> 52:17.931
But I'll let her know you're coming by.

52:18.265 --> 52:20.475
[EMILY ON PHONE] Thank you. See you soon.

52:24.187 --> 52:26.787
Good news. We might be able
to go for that walk today, after all.

52:27.315 --> 52:28.859
That’s wonderful!

52:29.609 --> 52:31.194
What changed your mind?

52:31.319 --> 52:33.321
It's your granddaughter, Emily.

52:35.115 --> 52:38.076
(eerie string music)

52:41.163 --> 52:41.955
Emily.

52:42.581 --> 52:44.461
She came by the other
day, but you were asleep.

52:44.791 --> 52:46.835
She just called to say she's on her way.

52:50.922 --> 52:51.673
Miss Gray

52:52.924 --> 52:55.343
She went to see what's in the attic.

53:06.897 --> 53:09.858
(low droning tones)

53:22.787 --> 53:24.998
All the way to the end, dear.

53:32.923 --> 53:35.884
(low drone continues)

53:57.239 --> 54:00.200
(whispering voices)

54:20.929 --> 54:23.890
(voices echoing quietly)

54:30.772 --> 54:31.731
I don't understand.

54:31.856 --> 54:33.566
[MRS. BLOOM] That's Emily's room.

54:33.692 --> 54:35.652
That's what's in the attic.

54:36.820 --> 54:39.239
I keep it locked because
I don't like her memories

54:39.364 --> 54:41.074
being disturbed.

54:41.866 --> 54:44.411
Besides, it’s not like I
can get up there anyway.

54:45.870 --> 54:48.039
Her memories.

54:48.832 --> 54:51.167
I don't know how to tell you this.

54:51.710 --> 54:55.046
Emily has been dead for a very long time.

54:55.630 --> 54:58.091
No, that's not possible. I saw her.

54:58.341 --> 55:00.552
What you saw isn't real.

55:01.303 --> 55:03.930
I know what I saw. I spoke with her.

55:04.931 --> 55:06.850
I have a feeling that you imagined

55:06.975 --> 55:08.184
the entire thing.

55:08.518 --> 55:10.895
[MRS. BLOOM] You're seeing things.
- I'm not seeing things.

55:11.021 --> 55:14.399
Emily Bloom died of tuberculosis.

55:16.109 --> 55:17.736
Where’s Charles? I’m leaving.

55:17.986 --> 55:19.446
He is not here.

55:20.280 --> 55:21.239
I need to get out of here.

55:21.281 --> 55:23.616
I'm leaving now.

55:34.502 --> 55:37.464
(gasping and coughing)

55:57.150 --> 55:58.902
(gasps)

55:59.444 --> 56:01.071
Hey hey hey. It's okay.

56:01.321 --> 56:02.614
How did I get here?

56:03.156 --> 56:05.158
You passed out. You need to lay down.

56:05.575 --> 56:06.785
You need to rest.

56:07.035 --> 56:09.037
How the fuck did I get here?

56:10.413 --> 56:11.790
No need for profanity, dear.

56:11.956 --> 56:13.375
Where's Charles?

56:13.958 --> 56:15.210
He isn't here.

56:15.335 --> 56:17.587
He went home to his
family. I told you that.

56:17.754 --> 56:19.172
I need to speak to Charles.

56:19.297 --> 56:20.382
You need to lay down.

56:20.507 --> 56:23.385
You passed...
- I need to speak with Charles now!

56:26.846 --> 56:28.056
Certainly.

56:28.556 --> 56:31.142
I'll get him on the phone.

56:38.066 --> 56:39.567
(line rings)

56:40.969 --> 56:41.778
[CHARLES ON PHONE] Hello?

56:41.820 --> 56:43.071
Hi, Mr. Bloom.

56:43.196 --> 56:44.364
It's Veronica.

56:44.739 --> 56:47.075
[CHARLES ON PHONE] Everything all right?

56:49.494 --> 56:51.413
I wanted to talk to you.

56:52.622 --> 56:54.958
Haven't been feeling well recently.

56:55.792 --> 56:58.753
I know we talked about me staying here, but

57:00.296 --> 57:02.549
it's getting to be too stressful for me.

57:03.508 --> 57:04.884
I don't feel well.

57:05.009 --> 57:06.386
Can't sleep.

57:07.429 --> 57:09.222
I feel sick.

57:09.639 --> 57:11.850
I was wondering if I could go home.

57:13.393 --> 57:15.311
[CHARLES] I'm so sorry to hear that.

57:15.687 --> 57:18.189
I know taking care of my mother isn't easy.

57:18.565 --> 57:20.650
I was hoping you'd be able to help.

57:20.859 --> 57:22.861
It's only temporary, remember?

57:23.486 --> 57:25.113
I know. It's just.

57:25.738 --> 57:28.116
[CHARLES] Ms. Gray,
we really need your help.

57:28.533 --> 57:30.618
I can't. I'm sorry.

57:32.537 --> 57:34.914
[CHARLES] I understand.

57:35.874 --> 57:37.792
I'll take you home in the morning.

57:37.917 --> 57:39.335
Thank you.

57:46.676 --> 57:48.052
Is the soup ready?

57:48.261 --> 57:49.846
I'm very hungry.

57:51.014 --> 57:53.975
(crickets chirping)

57:56.728 --> 57:58.271
Everything okay?

57:58.980 --> 57:59.814
Fine.

58:00.315 --> 58:01.774
Just eat your soup.

58:02.233 --> 58:04.027
Okay.

58:07.739 --> 58:10.241
You seemed pretty eager
to eat a few minutes ago.

58:14.537 --> 58:15.246
Miss Gray...

58:16.122 --> 58:17.957
Why do you want to go home?

58:18.458 --> 58:19.417
Sorry.

58:20.293 --> 58:22.045
Why do you want to leave me?

58:22.504 --> 58:24.797
Have I not been a good hostess?

58:25.548 --> 58:26.716
Did I do something wrong?

58:26.966 --> 58:29.135
Mrs. Bloom... please.

58:30.845 --> 58:34.140
I made this soup so
that you could feel better.

58:34.766 --> 58:37.143
I care about you

58:38.603 --> 58:40.939
Thank you. I promise it's not you.

58:43.024 --> 58:44.943
I have to go home.

58:49.364 --> 58:51.366
I understand.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.954
Hope you don't hate me.

58:56.704 --> 58:58.581
I don't hate you.

58:59.165 --> 59:01.084
I just can't stay here.

59:01.876 --> 59:03.628
I have to go. I’m sorry.

59:06.464 --> 59:08.174
It’s what they've all said.

59:10.051 --> 59:13.346
I need you to stay.

59:21.271 --> 59:24.232
(loud tense strings)

59:25.984 --> 59:27.944
I'm sorry too...

59:28.611 --> 59:30.530
but you will stay in this house

59:30.655 --> 59:33.950
just exactly as long as I want you to.

59:37.453 --> 59:40.415
(creepy 1920s music)

59:49.257 --> 59:52.218
(rainfall)

01:00:03.104 --> 01:00:06.065
(thunder rumbles)

01:00:30.548 --> 01:00:33.509
(birds chirping)

01:00:56.157 --> 01:00:58.159
Good morning, dear.

01:01:00.745 --> 01:01:02.121
Good morning, Mrs. Bloom.

01:01:02.664 --> 01:01:04.207
How are you feeling?

01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:05.792
I'm good.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:07.210
How are you?

01:01:08.127 --> 01:01:11.255
I'm very well, thank you.

01:01:15.051 --> 01:01:16.844
What happened last night?

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.097
I can't remember anything.

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:21.391
You fell down and hit your head.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.227
Please be more careful.

01:01:27.563 --> 01:01:29.440
That is killing me.

01:01:30.733 --> 01:01:32.485
Why don't you come have some breakfast?

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.404
You'll feel better.

01:01:35.905 --> 01:01:38.866
(quiet high pitch noises)

01:02:16.404 --> 01:02:19.365
(water running)

01:02:38.801 --> 01:02:41.763
(loud scary music)

01:02:53.858 --> 01:02:56.819
(music fades)

01:03:29.602 --> 01:03:32.563
(eerie music)

01:03:42.114 --> 01:03:44.367
Sometimes I wonder why this happened to me.

01:03:44.617 --> 01:03:47.245
Feels like too much to bear.

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.330
Things will get better.

01:04:11.394 --> 01:04:14.480
We found a candidate today.
She's a lovely young lady.

01:04:14.605 --> 01:04:17.233
Charles has been looking
into her for a while.

01:04:17.859 --> 01:04:21.737
She's the most beautiful blue
eyes. I feel so bad about all this.

01:04:21.863 --> 01:04:23.489
She looks like a nice girl.

01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:25.074
We had dinner.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.160
Her name is Veronica.

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:41.549
Frank is finally ready. It's happening.

01:04:41.924 --> 01:04:43.217
I miss home so much.

01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:45.636
(bell ringing)

01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:56.606
(crickets chirping)

01:05:00.401 --> 01:05:03.362
(house phone rings)

01:05:28.804 --> 01:05:31.766
(house phone rings)

01:05:47.281 --> 01:05:47.881
Hello?

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:49.408
[EMILY ON PHONE] Hey, Veronica.

01:05:51.953 --> 01:05:53.079
Who is this?

01:05:53.371 --> 01:05:54.497
It's Emily, silly.

01:05:54.622 --> 01:05:56.916
Can I stop by tomorrow to see Grandma?

01:05:58.167 --> 01:05:59.585
You're not real.

01:05:59.752 --> 01:06:01.379
You're not fucking real.

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:04.423
(house phone rings)

01:06:06.342 --> 01:06:08.427
You need to leave me the fuck alone.

01:06:08.552 --> 01:06:10.846
[WOMAN ON PHONE] Honey? It’s me! Mom!

01:06:12.515 --> 01:06:13.432
Hey, babe.

01:06:14.266 --> 01:06:15.643
Everything okay?

01:06:16.394 --> 01:06:17.278
Yeah.

01:06:17.853 --> 01:06:19.397
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:06:19.981 --> 01:06:21.983
I got a call from weird number.

01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:24.735
How come you didn't call me?

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.030
Sorry, I don't have service where I’m at.

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:31.659
Well where are you? Is everything okay?

01:06:33.911 --> 01:06:36.414
I have a long day ahead of me tomorrow, but

01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:37.790
I'll see you soon.

01:06:37.999 --> 01:06:41.377
What do you mean? I
thought you took that job?

01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:44.380
I'll call you on my drive back.

01:06:45.756 --> 01:06:47.675
I'll explain it all tomorrow.

01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:51.095
[MOM] Call me if you need anything.

01:06:51.512 --> 01:06:52.763
I will.

01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:38.684
(low pitched drone noise)

01:08:10.174 --> 01:08:13.135
(voices whisper and echo)

01:08:24.814 --> 01:08:26.398
Hello?

01:08:32.196 --> 01:08:33.739
Are you ready? - Yes.

01:08:34.323 --> 01:08:36.534
Just give me one minute.

01:09:09.483 --> 01:09:11.819
What is happening to me?

01:09:26.208 --> 01:09:27.710
(banging on door)

01:09:28.127 --> 01:09:29.962
Ms. Gray, are you ready to go?

01:09:30.254 --> 01:09:31.797
Yeah. One second.

01:09:39.805 --> 01:09:41.682
Thank you for coming today.

01:09:41.974 --> 01:09:43.058
Of course.

01:09:43.434 --> 01:09:44.643
It's grocery day.

01:09:44.977 --> 01:09:46.145
I brought groceries.

01:09:46.312 --> 01:09:47.938
And your paycheck too.

01:09:48.814 --> 01:09:49.940
Paycheck?

01:09:50.065 --> 01:09:50.900
Yeah.

01:09:51.192 --> 01:09:52.109
Got it right here.

01:09:52.234 --> 01:09:54.778
But it's only been a week.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.366
It's been a bit longer than that.

01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:03.954
It got here really fast.

01:10:05.497 --> 01:10:07.666
Did you come to take me home?

01:10:10.211 --> 01:10:12.880
There must be some
misunderstanding, Miss Gray.

01:10:13.714 --> 01:10:16.091
What's all this about taking you home?

01:10:18.177 --> 01:10:20.638
We talked on the phone

01:10:21.263 --> 01:10:22.681
last night.

01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:25.809
You said you would take me home.

01:10:30.189 --> 01:10:33.400
We've never had this conversation before.

01:10:34.485 --> 01:10:36.195
Yes, we did.

01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:38.906
You promised.

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:41.867
You said you would take me home.

01:10:42.243 --> 01:10:45.120
I am so sorry. If I had any idea...

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:46.747
You knew.

01:10:46.914 --> 01:10:48.874
You both knew.

01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:52.711
I'm not crazy.

01:10:54.505 --> 01:10:56.882
We've had this conversation.

01:10:57.183 --> 01:10:57.967
Ms. Gray...

01:10:58.092 --> 01:11:01.095
I’m spending the night
tonight. That's why I came.

01:11:02.054 --> 01:11:04.390
We both need some
rest and it’s a long drive.

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.227
Why don't you rest up tonight

01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:10.104
and tomorrow

01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:13.357
I will take you home first thing.

01:11:13.732 --> 01:11:15.359
Is that okay?

01:11:17.069 --> 01:11:18.612
I promise.

01:11:21.782 --> 01:11:24.868
Yes, please.

01:11:25.953 --> 01:11:28.289
Thank you.

01:11:32.376 --> 01:11:35.462
I'm going to need you
to get some rest, please.

01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:40.467
All these things that you
say you're seeing and hearing,

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.095
they're not real.

01:11:45.889 --> 01:11:48.851
(eerie music)

01:11:50.561 --> 01:11:53.522
(crying)

01:13:09.598 --> 01:13:12.559
(screams)

01:13:15.187 --> 01:13:17.064
Miss Gray, are you ok?

01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:20.734
You killed him!

01:13:21.735 --> 01:13:23.028
You killed him!

01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:34.915
He was right there.

01:13:35.165 --> 01:13:36.885
You have to believe me. He was right there.

01:13:37.584 --> 01:13:38.544
Miss Gray...

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:41.004
You need to get some
sleep. You're hallucinating.

01:13:41.255 --> 01:13:42.172
I'm not hallucinating.

01:13:42.381 --> 01:13:43.424
I saw him!

01:13:43.757 --> 01:13:45.843
You need to get some rest.

01:13:49.096 --> 01:13:52.057
I can’t. It’s been a week.

01:13:52.391 --> 01:13:53.934
I can't sleep.

01:13:54.184 --> 01:13:55.978
It's been two months.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.480
You've been in the house for two months.

01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:01.024
No, It's been a week.

01:14:01.233 --> 01:14:02.693
You dropped me off a week ago.

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.736
I dropped you off in March.

01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:06.155
It’s May.

01:14:06.864 --> 01:14:08.031
It was a week ago.

01:14:08.157 --> 01:14:09.533
I remember this.

01:14:13.412 --> 01:14:14.538
So please get some rest.

01:14:14.872 --> 01:14:16.373
You are not well.

01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:19.042
I promise I'll get you out
of here as soon as I can.

01:14:20.919 --> 01:14:22.504
I promise.

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:25.799
Please calm down.

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:29.094
Everything is okay.

01:14:48.238 --> 01:14:49.615
How's your tea?

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:51.074
Great,

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:53.035
thanks.

01:14:54.244 --> 01:14:56.497
Charles said it would all work out.

01:14:56.997 --> 01:14:59.249
You were the one.

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:02.544
At the end of the day,
he didn't choose you.

01:15:02.794 --> 01:15:04.004
The house did.

01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:05.964
What?

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.761
You wondered why you keep
seeing all these strange things.

01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:13.096
I’m not seeing things.

01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:15.682
It's all real.

01:15:18.727 --> 01:15:20.437
You belong here, Miss Gray.

01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:23.732
The house wants you here.

01:15:24.775 --> 01:15:26.527
It's all in your head.

01:15:26.818 --> 01:15:28.654
You're literally insane.

01:15:28.946 --> 01:15:30.072
Am I?

01:15:30.989 --> 01:15:33.784
Or am I finally telling you the truth?

01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:36.828
I said I'm not going
to be here much longer.

01:15:36.954 --> 01:15:39.248
If Charles doesn't come get me by tomorrow.

01:15:40.082 --> 01:15:42.042
I'm walking

01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.794
all the way home.

01:15:44.044 --> 01:15:46.922
You still don't get it, do you?

01:15:47.673 --> 01:15:49.925
Look at your hair,

01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:52.386
your face.

01:15:53.136 --> 01:15:55.055
It's already happening.

01:15:55.347 --> 01:15:57.599
You can't go home now.

01:15:57.891 --> 01:16:00.143
(laughing)

01:16:01.144 --> 01:16:03.480
What is happening to me?

01:16:04.356 --> 01:16:06.650
Why am I aging?

01:16:08.402 --> 01:16:09.820
Tell me!

01:16:11.154 --> 01:16:13.073
It’s such a shame. You’re so pretty!

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.453
You’re a demented old
lady. You’re a selfish bitch.

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:20.539
And that's why you're alone.

01:16:20.872 --> 01:16:23.834
(Mrs. Bloom laughs)

01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:26.670
I hope you fucking die!

01:16:31.049 --> 01:16:34.011
(Mrs. Bloom crying)

01:16:37.848 --> 01:16:40.809
(banging on door)

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:51.403
Have you lost your damn
mind? What is wrong with you?

01:16:52.863 --> 01:16:54.906
You hit an 80 year old woman.

01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:57.701
You hit a sick 80 year old woman?

01:16:57.909 --> 01:16:59.411
I didn’t mean to. It was an accident.

01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:00.746
An accident?

01:17:00.871 --> 01:17:02.998
You're lucky I don't
call the cops right now.

01:17:03.332 --> 01:17:04.291
She said...

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:05.709
I had to.

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:07.461
I don’t know.

01:17:07.919 --> 01:17:09.755
I gave you an opportunity.

01:17:10.047 --> 01:17:11.548
I paid you well.

01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:13.925
I brought you into my home.

01:17:14.217 --> 01:17:15.886
And this is how you repay us?

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:18.513
Have we not been good enough to you?

01:17:19.181 --> 01:17:20.515
You have. I'm sorry.

01:17:20.849 --> 01:17:22.351
She loves you.

01:17:22.684 --> 01:17:24.561
She treats you like a daughter.

01:17:24.686 --> 01:17:26.813
The least you could do
is show her some respect.

01:17:26.938 --> 01:17:28.774
Won't happen again, I promise.

01:17:28.899 --> 01:17:31.234
If you ever strike my mother again,

01:17:32.194 --> 01:17:33.820
you will regret it.

01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:35.489
Please, I’m so sorry.

01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:37.741
I promise.

01:17:39.242 --> 01:17:40.744
One more week

01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:42.871
you owe me.

01:17:43.497 --> 01:17:45.123
You stay one more week.

01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:12.984
Sorry.

01:18:13.944 --> 01:18:16.780
If you're not going to do
a good job, just don't do it.

01:18:17.364 --> 01:18:20.325
Now, I know you and Charles
came to an agreement,

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:24.079
but if you don't want to be here, just go.

01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:27.457
I'm sorry

01:18:28.625 --> 01:18:30.460
I lost my patience.

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:33.088
I do want to be here with you.

01:18:33.213 --> 01:18:34.673
I promise

01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:37.319
I'm going to be here for another week.

01:18:57.529 --> 01:19:00.157
So you never tell me where you're going.

01:19:02.033 --> 01:19:04.953
Out of this house.

01:19:06.288 --> 01:19:07.497
Finally.

01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:10.292
Is Charles taking you with him?

01:19:10.584 --> 01:19:12.419
I certainly hope so.

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:18.800
Is that your family in that picture?

01:19:19.634 --> 01:19:22.512
You’ve never talked about them.

01:19:23.764 --> 01:19:25.599
You've never asked.

01:19:27.017 --> 01:19:28.810
I was scared to.

01:19:30.437 --> 01:19:33.273
Why are their faces scratched off?

01:19:34.232 --> 01:19:36.568
Why are you so interested in my family?

01:19:37.402 --> 01:19:38.862
On your last week?

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.865
Sorry, I was just curious.

01:19:43.033 --> 01:19:47.078
You shouldn't ask questions you
don't want the answers to, dear.

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:55.420
I think I'm finally packed.

01:19:58.799 --> 01:20:01.176
I’m finished.

01:20:04.679 --> 01:20:06.640
I'm finished packing.

01:20:11.728 --> 01:20:13.396
(muffled voices)

01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:15.315
(female voice) I think it would work.

01:20:15.941 --> 01:20:18.151
(muffled male voice) I’ve
made all the preparations.

01:20:20.987 --> 01:20:23.147
(muffled voice) How much
longer is this going to take?

01:20:25.534 --> 01:20:28.161
I don’t think I can wait much longer.

01:20:28.829 --> 01:20:31.122
Will it work?

01:20:41.174 --> 01:20:44.135
(muffled voices)

01:20:47.931 --> 01:20:50.934
I feel bad about doing this to her, but

01:20:51.268 --> 01:20:54.020
I don’t have a choice.

01:20:59.484 --> 01:21:01.069
Are you not eating?

01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:03.405
Doesn't look very appetizing.

01:21:07.993 --> 01:21:10.161
Who cooked today?

01:21:10.287 --> 01:21:12.581
I don't remember cooking.

01:21:12.747 --> 01:21:13.999
I did.

01:21:14.291 --> 01:21:16.459
I'm feeling much better.

01:21:17.377 --> 01:21:18.753
I'm so glad.

01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:22.215
I don't know what's wrong with me lately.

01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:24.551
I don’t really remember anything.

01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:29.431
It will get better, I promise.

01:21:31.349 --> 01:21:34.311
Mrs. Bloom, what's happening to me?

01:21:36.187 --> 01:21:38.315
I've read your diary.

01:21:41.067 --> 01:21:44.571
You shouldn't go around touching
things that don't belong to you.

01:21:44.905 --> 01:21:46.781
You should not have read that.

01:21:47.866 --> 01:21:49.266
I'm trying to make sense of things.

01:21:49.367 --> 01:21:51.745
And I've seen the pictures on the wall

01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:54.122
with their faces scratched out.

01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:57.292
I was scared to ask why

01:21:59.294 --> 01:22:01.713
Then I read what you wrote.

01:22:03.089 --> 01:22:05.717
You're not Mrs. Bloom, are you?

01:22:06.635 --> 01:22:08.011
You are wrong.

01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:13.099
I have been Mrs. Bloom
for a very, very long time.

01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:16.519
But soon, I won’t be.

01:22:19.105 --> 01:22:20.649
You can walk?

01:22:21.733 --> 01:22:24.069
I’m feeling much stronger.

01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:26.613
I have you to thank for that.

01:22:27.948 --> 01:22:29.449
Why am I here?

01:22:29.574 --> 01:22:32.035
You are very, very special to me,

01:22:36.706 --> 01:22:39.668
(suspenseful percussion music)

01:22:50.845 --> 01:22:53.515
You know, the house won't
let you leave, Miss Gray.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.225
I'm so sorry.

01:22:58.144 --> 01:23:00.814
Why don't you just come back in?

01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:06.611
Don't make me have to come get you.

01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:11.992
(music stops)

01:23:13.827 --> 01:23:16.788
(tense electronic music)

01:24:21.269 --> 01:24:24.522
Do you have any idea what
it's like to be utterly alone?

01:24:26.191 --> 01:24:27.358
To have no one?

01:24:28.902 --> 01:24:30.528
No one to talk to.

01:24:30.862 --> 01:24:33.031
No one to lay next to at night.

01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:36.785
No family, no hope.

01:24:38.661 --> 01:24:40.371
No will to live.

01:24:43.416 --> 01:24:45.543
Please understand.

01:24:47.587 --> 01:24:51.007
I just want to go home.

01:24:58.264 --> 01:25:01.434
She had it all, you know.

01:25:01.559 --> 01:25:03.436
Mrs. Bloom.

01:25:07.107 --> 01:25:10.318
It was ripped away from her.

01:25:11.444 --> 01:25:15.323
Emily contracted tuberculosis.

01:25:17.033 --> 01:25:20.120
Mrs. Bloom caught it taking care of Emily,

01:25:21.121 --> 01:25:23.248
and they just left her.

01:25:24.499 --> 01:25:29.879
He abandoned both of
them to just die in that house.

01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:34.676
After Emily died,

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:37.220
she prayed for death.

01:25:37.595 --> 01:25:40.765
She begged for death,
but death would not come.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.102
So this woman of faith,

01:25:44.978 --> 01:25:46.604
did the unthinkable.

01:25:48.106 --> 01:25:50.692
She made a deal with an evil spirit

01:25:51.234 --> 01:25:53.653
in exchange for her death,

01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:58.950
she would trap another
“Bloom” in her place.

01:26:00.743 --> 01:26:03.496
The spirit absolutely determined

01:26:04.497 --> 01:26:06.457
that Mrs Bloom would
get revenge on the family

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:09.252
that just left her here to rot.

01:26:11.921 --> 01:26:13.590
Oh, don't tell me that you don't see.

01:26:14.716 --> 01:26:16.843
Don't tell me you don't
see the resemblance.

01:26:18.219 --> 01:26:20.889
With those big, beautiful blue eyes...

01:26:24.684 --> 01:26:26.019
I really am sorry,

01:26:28.438 --> 01:26:30.982
but it's your turn now.

01:26:35.737 --> 01:26:38.698
(Veronica breathes heavily)

01:26:39.490 --> 01:26:42.452
(dark ominous music)

01:27:46.474 --> 01:27:49.435
And I will give you a new heart.

01:27:49.769 --> 01:27:52.313
A new spirit will I put within you.

01:27:53.773 --> 01:27:56.192
And I will remove your heart of stone

01:27:56.734 --> 01:27:58.945
and give you a heart of flesh.

01:28:03.825 --> 01:28:07.328
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ,

01:28:07.578 --> 01:28:09.580
He is a new creature.

01:28:10.456 --> 01:28:12.125
The old is gone.

01:28:12.959 --> 01:28:15.044
The new has come.

01:28:22.343 --> 01:28:25.305
(ominous music)

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.317
Take her away.

01:29:19.525 --> 01:29:21.486
Take her away!

01:29:26.449 --> 01:29:29.410
(melancholy music)

01:29:41.339 --> 01:29:44.300
(sobbing)

01:30:16.916 --> 01:30:17.750
Dad!

01:30:24.173 --> 01:30:27.135
(both crying)

01:31:14.474 --> 01:31:17.810
The worst is the first couple days.

01:31:28.571 --> 01:31:31.115
Thanks for helping me pack.

01:31:37.288 --> 01:31:40.041
I can’t say I’m gonna miss this place.

01:31:54.931 --> 01:31:58.226
The house doesn’t like to be changed.

01:31:59.519 --> 01:32:01.812
You’ll have to leave those up.

01:32:09.237 --> 01:32:12.657
But when you find the right
person, it’ll let you know.

01:32:30.174 --> 01:32:33.135
And you’ll have him to keep you company.

01:33:00.496 --> 01:33:03.457
(somber ethereal music)

01:33:15.219 --> 01:33:18.180
(wind blows)

01:34:25.956 --> 01:34:28.918
(sinister music)
