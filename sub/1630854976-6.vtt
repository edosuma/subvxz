Can you tell us how you started
to piece these cases together?

03:36.590 --> 03:37.880
(indiscernible)

06:30.140 --> 06:33.180
What did the other
officers think?

08:29.500 --> 08:32.550
And how is this related to
the Dorothy Daye case?

09:22.060 --> 09:23.930
Seen what before?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.310
And what made him think that?

19:23.510 --> 19:24.990
Anything specific.

21:34.120 --> 21:37.170
Was Andrea into ****** when she
was younger?

22:24.260 --> 22:25.590
You mentioned a sleepover?

24:19.910 --> 24:22.960
Do you think Andrea
is dangerous?

28:24.030 --> 28:26.390
Why aren't you trying to
give us more information?

28:26.590 --> 28:27.910
What are you hiding?

28:41.800 --> 28:43.220
We just want you to be honest.

29:49.780 --> 29:51.350
So it's been a couple of weeks
now that we've been

29:51.550 --> 29:53.190
following this thread.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.660
What happened when you brought
this up to your superiors?

31:34.970 --> 31:35.970
Is this her brother?

32:10.840 --> 32:12.970
Do you think there are more
murders out there?
