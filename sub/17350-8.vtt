00:27.167 --> 00:30.833
This is Thunderbird 3.
I'm making my approach
to the comet now.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.833
What a view!
Decreasing acceleration.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.600
Steady. Steady.

00:36.667 --> 00:40.633
Ow! What did you do that for?
I was just about to land.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.767
Alan, you were flying
in your sleep again.

00:43.833 --> 00:46.167
No... Maybe.

00:46.233 --> 00:47.900
Look, I can't help it!

00:47.967 --> 00:50.233
The news has been covering
the return of Halley's Comet
all week.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.967
It's all I can think about!

00:52.033 --> 00:53.600
That's why I woke you up.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.167
Some famous adventurer

00:55.233 --> 00:57.933
is about to broadcast
a big announcement.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.667
Huh? Are they showing
the comet? How far out is it?

01:00.733 --> 01:03.600
Did you know we won't see it
again for another 75 years?

01:03.667 --> 01:06.133
It's not the first time you've
reminded us of that, Alan.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.267
Or the second.
Or the third. Or the...

01:09.333 --> 01:11.300
There he is, there!
The rich explorer guy.

01:11.367 --> 01:13.200
Franci... What's his name?

01:13.267 --> 01:14.833
FRANCOIS:
Francois Lemaire here.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.100
Close enough.

01:16.167 --> 01:18.567
To all you watching at home,
you are about to witness

01:18.633 --> 01:20.400
history in the making.

01:20.467 --> 01:23.733
Joining me is my personal
biographer Madeline Lemaire.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.967
Oh, and for the record,
this wasn't my idea at all.

01:28.067 --> 01:32.600
Halley's Comet is making
its closest approach
to Earth in 75 years.

01:32.667 --> 01:36.167
What a magnificent
ball of fire and ice!

01:36.233 --> 01:37.867
Yeah, actually, it's just ice.

01:37.933 --> 01:41.567
And I've just become the first
person in history to visit it.

01:41.633 --> 01:44.667
That is so cool! Oh, man,
I wish I'd have
thought of that.

01:44.733 --> 01:47.067
I'm glad you didn't.
It's a risky move.

01:47.133 --> 01:49.200
But as long as he stays
out of the comet's tail,

01:49.267 --> 01:50.600
he'll probably be okay.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.667
I had planned to
make this a fly-by,

01:52.733 --> 01:55.367
but it would be a shame
not to see it a little closer

01:55.433 --> 01:57.733
so I've decided
this very moment

01:57.800 --> 02:00.300
to go inside the comet's tail.

02:00.367 --> 02:03.200
No! That is a seriously
bad idea!

02:03.267 --> 02:06.433
Wow! You do realize
he can't actually hear you?

02:06.500 --> 02:09.967
Amazing. I see chunks of
rock and ice everywhere.

02:10.067 --> 02:13.400
This is possibly the
most dangerous place
I've ever been.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.267
(GASPS) That's a big one.

02:16.333 --> 02:19.433

my custom-built space yacht,
the Solar Wind,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.933

sophisticated autopilots
ever built...

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
Thunderbirds are go!

03:15.600 --> 03:18.633
I lost Francois Lemaire's
feed at the same time
as the networks.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.600
Do we even know
if he's still out there?

03:20.667 --> 03:22.533
Yes, I am able to
track his ship.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.467
He's in the coma of
Halley's Comet, all right.

03:24.533 --> 03:27.467
But his ship hasn't moved
under its own power
since we lost the feed.

03:27.533 --> 03:29.067
If they don't have
flight capability,

03:29.133 --> 03:30.433
they're gonna get smashed up.

03:30.500 --> 03:31.700
Lemaire hasn't called for help

03:31.767 --> 03:33.567
and there's no emergency
beacon, either.

03:33.633 --> 03:35.333
I can't see his ship
lasting long out there.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.700
Well, it's our job to pull
him and his passenger
out in one piece.

03:38.767 --> 03:41.433
Maybe If we get closer, we can
re-establish communications.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.067
Alan, looks like you're gonna
see that comet after all.

No, not that. Halley's Comet
only comes around once
every 75 years

and we are gonna be there
to see it up close.

Alan, we don't have
the time to do "awesome."

05:17.600 --> 05:18.733

We have to focus on
what's important here.

13:18.267 --> 13:19.633
I don't even care which one.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.833
Except not the
chateau in Lyon.

13:21.900 --> 13:23.733
The wallpaper gives
me a headache.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.300
Mr. Lemaire,
International Rescue.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.633
Everybody okay in here?

13:28.700 --> 13:31.200
Any injuries?
Atmospheric breaches?

13:31.267 --> 13:32.600
I'll be with you
in just a moment.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.733
I'm recording this
for posterity.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.133
-Posterity?
-FRANCOIS: Shh.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.667
And the world-famous
International Rescue
has just arrived.

13:39.733 --> 13:43.367
As you can see, we are in a
pretty dangerous predicament.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.633
-Madeline, do you
want to get in shot?
-MADELINE:I'll pass.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.800
Sir, we don't have
a lot of time.

13:47.867 --> 13:49.367
Oh, I remember you.

13:49.433 --> 13:52.633
That's right, Mariana Trench.
Your birthday party.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.833
You were so helpful.
Practically saved our lives.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.133
I really do appreciate
your coming out all this way.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.300
Let's see what's
going on here.

13:59.367 --> 14:02.633
Yes, thank you, let's do that.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.500
SCOTT: Okay, let's
start over here.

14:04.567 --> 14:06.967
So it looks like this chap is
going to repair the controls

14:07.067 --> 14:08.600
-and get us up
and running again.
-(CLANGING)

14:08.667 --> 14:11.667
-Come on, there we go.
-FRANCOIS: Careful, please!

14:11.733 --> 14:13.867
We've already had enough
damage to this ship.

14:13.933 --> 14:16.100
-(CLANGING)
-(SCOTT GRUNTS)

14:16.600 --> 14:17.667
Hey!

14:17.733 --> 14:20.900
Okay, let's see
the other side.

14:20.967 --> 14:23.467
-Excuse me! (SIGHS)
-(BANGING)

14:23.533 --> 14:26.867
Nano-crafted mahogany imported
from southern Amazonia

14:26.933 --> 14:28.233
and he's breaking it up
like firewood.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.200
-Think I'll help.
-Traitor!

14:33.300 --> 14:35.067
Is all that really necessary?

14:35.133 --> 14:36.433
Oh, absolutely.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.367
A-ha!

14:39.367 --> 14:40.867
The propulsion system is shot.

14:40.933 --> 14:44.133
This ship is never gonna leave
the surface of Halley's Comet.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.933
Well, that is just ridiculous.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.400
The Solar Wind is now
a historical artifact

14:49.467 --> 14:51.700
like those capsules
that went to the moon.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.233
It deserves to be in a museum.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.167
You're welcome to come back
and get it in another
75 years.

14:56.233 --> 14:58.567
Unacceptable.
And this is all your fault.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.967
We were doing just fine
exploring the comet's tail

15:01.067 --> 15:02.500
until you had to come
and make us crash.

15:02.567 --> 15:04.933
We were both impacted by
high-velocity debris.

15:05.067 --> 15:08.067
And that was because
you took your ship
into the coma.

15:08.133 --> 15:09.700
-Coma?
-The tail-y bit.

15:09.767 --> 15:12.400
I thought you didn't know
anything about comets.

15:12.467 --> 15:14.200
I'll be sending a bill
for all damages

15:14.267 --> 15:17.633
to International Rescue.
Good day.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.767
-Where are you going?
-FRANCOIS: Over here!

15:19.833 --> 15:22.167
-I can still see you.
-FRANCOIS: I'm not listening.

15:22.233 --> 15:24.433
Just be thankful
that you're still intact.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.733
I'll contact Thunderbird 3
to come get us.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.267
SCOTT: Watch your step.
Over this way.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.433
Huh?

15:38.933 --> 15:40.300
(GRUNTS)

15:44.133 --> 15:45.533
(GRUNTS)

15:46.067 --> 15:47.400
Come on!

15:51.433 --> 15:53.433
(GRUNTING)

15:53.967 --> 15:55.600
There.

15:55.667 --> 15:58.500
How much more of this?
Aren't we safe right here?

15:58.567 --> 16:00.667
We're not safe
until we're home.

16:00.733 --> 16:02.833
(RUMBLING)

16:02.900 --> 16:04.467
Get a move on! Now!

16:05.100 --> 16:06.400
Whoa!

16:10.067 --> 16:11.367
(SCREAMING)

16:16.500 --> 16:18.567
(RUMBLING)

16:22.367 --> 16:24.133
(BLAST)

16:24.200 --> 16:26.700
-That could have been us.
-We'll wait here for
Thunderbird 3 to arrive.

16:26.767 --> 16:29.667
-Wait?
-Don't worry,
we're gonna be okay.

16:32.833 --> 16:35.167
ALAN: Scott, I've got visuals
on you and the others.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.400
I'm coming in.

16:56.167 --> 16:59.400
-ALAN: Thunderbird 3
is locked on solid.
-Let's go. Now!

16:59.467 --> 17:01.400
-(RUMBLING)
-(MADELINE WHIMPERS)

17:01.467 --> 17:03.400
ALAN: This whole place
is coming apart!

17:03.467 --> 17:05.533
What can we do? It's too late!

17:05.600 --> 17:08.767
Not if we jump. Quickly.
I'll follow right behind you.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.067
(GRUNTING)

17:11.067 --> 17:12.467
(SCREAMING)

17:15.733 --> 17:17.133
(SCREAMING)

17:20.500 --> 17:22.533
(RUMBLING)

17:22.600 --> 17:24.067
SCOTT: I've got you.

17:27.633 --> 17:30.200
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)

17:30.267 --> 17:32.700
Alan, you should be in
the cockpit. What's up?

17:32.767 --> 17:35.233
ALAN: I just thought you might
need some help and...

17:35.300 --> 17:37.767
Come on. I had to set foot
on Halley's Comet,

17:37.833 --> 17:39.767
even if it's only a
little piece of it.

17:39.833 --> 17:42.067
Let's get inside.

17:42.067 --> 17:45.333
Thank you. You two
are totally amazing!

17:47.633 --> 17:51.333
Okay, Halley's Comet,
see you in 75 years.

17:55.433 --> 17:56.667
Watch your step, Mr. Lemaire.

17:56.733 --> 17:59.333
(SCOFFS) Please.
I've conquered Everest.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.867
-(RUMBLING)
-(SCREAMING)

18:01.933 --> 18:03.500
Oh no! Scott!

18:04.900 --> 18:06.333
Alan!

18:09.800 --> 18:11.167
(GROANS)

18:15.533 --> 18:16.567
(GRUNTING)

18:18.767 --> 18:20.700
-(SCREAMING)
-Hang on!

18:21.467 --> 18:22.567
Hey!

18:26.067 --> 18:28.767
ALAN: Hold on tight.
Here we go.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.300
Incoming!

18:40.433 --> 18:43.067
Scream if you want
to go faster.

18:50.733 --> 18:52.433
ALAN: Smooth ride, huh?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.067
Hold on tight!
Here we go.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.367
Preparing for entry.

19:07.267 --> 19:09.067
(FRANCOIS WHIMPERS)

19:09.067 --> 19:11.733
-Everest, huh?
-And K2.

19:13.167 --> 19:15.200
-Nice catch.
-Nice throw.

19:20.067 --> 19:23.733
You have quite the knack
for getting rescued,
my dear husband.

19:23.800 --> 19:28.133
(CHUCKLES) I can't wait
to write this chapter
in your biography.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.767
Should be a good one.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.567
SCOTT: Now we just
have to get out through
the debris field.

19:41.633 --> 19:44.400
Yeah, so? I've had it up
to here with space debris.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.900
-Scott, we'll be fine.
-Hmm.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.233
I got here okay.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.833
Let me show you how I do it.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.800
First, I relax.

19:51.867 --> 19:53.267
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Ah!

19:53.333 --> 19:55.133
And then I don't think.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.367
I just watch and do.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.567
Uh-oh.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.267
-There you go.
-Almost clear.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.267
Okay. Looks like
Halley's Comet threw
one last snowball at us.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.667
But life support looks good.

20:28.733 --> 20:32.367
Down to one engine.
It's gonna take forever
to get home.

20:32.433 --> 20:35.967
But we have such fine company.
Can't wait to let 'em know.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.233
(BEEPING)

20:37.300 --> 20:39.267
ALAN: Thirty-six hours
is the best we can do.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.600
Three days to get
back to Earth?

20:41.667 --> 20:44.367
-One and a half, actually.
-(SCOFFS)

20:44.433 --> 20:45.667
What are we supposed to do?

20:45.733 --> 20:47.700
There's nothing here
in your cargo hold.

20:47.767 --> 20:52.100
No furniture. Not even
any cargo, never mind food.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.800
SCOTT: (CHUCKLES)
Actually you'll be happy
to know there is food.

20:55.867 --> 20:58.200
It's something Brains
whipped up for long trips.

20:58.267 --> 21:01.067
Brains? Doesn't sound
like a chef's name.

21:01.100 --> 21:05.333
Oh, he's very good.
His specialty is something
called "ration bars".

21:05.400 --> 21:08.267
-Oh, dear.
-SCOTT: You'll find
plenty of them in the bin.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.567
They have me
eating out of a bin.

21:10.633 --> 21:13.233
It's just like that farm
in Kent all over again.

21:13.300 --> 21:16.133
(CHUCKLES) Lucky
there's no duckies.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.533
SCOTT: Oh, and, Mr. Lemaire,

21:17.600 --> 21:19.533
Alan and I have been
discussing it

21:19.600 --> 21:22.133
and given the obvious
inconvenience,

21:22.200 --> 21:23.633
we're not gonna bill you
for the trip home.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.667
So have as many
ration bars as you like.

21:26.733 --> 21:28.800
(SIGHS) I want some cheese.
