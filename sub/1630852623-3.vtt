-Yes.
-Yes!

36:05.827 --> 36:07.550
Thank you so much. Thank you.

36:07.585 --> 36:09.034
-MAN: Well done.

36:09.068 --> 36:10.240
Thank you. Sorry, guys.

36:10.275 --> 36:12.034
[sighs] Come on, Dad.

36:12.068 --> 36:14.619
Taylor and Isaiah,
you are team number eight.

36:14.655 --> 36:16.619
Oh, my God! Let's go!

36:16.655 --> 36:19.068
KEOGHAN: Yeah. There are
two teams behind you.

36:19.103 --> 36:21.275
BOTH:
Mwah.

36:21.309 --> 36:22.757
SHERI:
There's a parking lot
right up there.

36:22.793 --> 36:24.000
If you pull in there,

36:24.034 --> 36:25.344
ask somebody
that's in the parking lot.

36:27.034 --> 36:31.378
We're lost. We're trying to get
to University of Glasgow.

36:31.413 --> 36:33.240
Yes.

36:33.275 --> 36:34.757
We're trying to get
to University Avenue

36:34.793 --> 36:36.103
-and the University of Glasgow.
-We're trying to get

36:36.137 --> 36:38.000
to the University of Glasgow.
Yeah.

36:41.516 --> 36:42.896
NATALIA:
Could we get some directions?

36:42.931 --> 36:44.344
University of Glasgow?

36:44.378 --> 36:46.378
ARUN:
I don't want
to get emotional about it,

36:46.413 --> 36:48.931
-but I think I failed that.
-No. Are you kidding?

36:48.965 --> 36:50.896
You just did
that entire challenge.

36:50.931 --> 36:54.103
I'm so proud of you.
Like, Dad, no. You did it!

36:54.137 --> 36:56.896
-Dad, seriously.
-[mumbles]

36:56.931 --> 36:59.585
Dad, seriously,
I'm so proud of you.

36:59.619 --> 37:01.688
I couldn't be more prouder
to have you as a dad.

37:01.724 --> 37:03.585
-It's okay.
-No, I'm serious.

37:03.619 --> 37:05.688
It's okay.
Let's concentrate now.

37:11.724 --> 37:14.724
Dad, you didn't fail me.

37:19.413 --> 37:22.034
If you can just, uh...

37:22.068 --> 37:23.550
Oh, wow.

37:27.378 --> 37:30.275
-SHERI: I think that was it, Ak.
-It wasn't M8.

37:30.309 --> 37:32.000
This looks like a parking lot.

37:36.757 --> 37:38.378
[both laugh]

37:38.413 --> 37:39.757
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.
We need some directions.

37:39.793 --> 37:41.068
We're trying to get
to the university.

37:41.103 --> 37:42.240
Could we...?
We're trying to get to the...

37:42.275 --> 37:44.550
Um, if you go left here
and straight up,

37:44.585 --> 37:46.000
-you get to the university.
-That's it?

37:46.034 --> 37:47.757
-University Avenue?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

37:47.793 --> 37:50.862
The third or fourth right
would be Kingston, correct?

37:50.896 --> 37:53.550
NATALIA:
Yup. I just want
to get through this point.

37:53.585 --> 37:56.206
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

37:57.965 --> 37:59.137
Hmm.

37:59.172 --> 38:01.793
Please, please,
please, please, please.

38:08.481 --> 38:11.655
-KEOGHAN: Oh, what a night.
-Phil.

38:11.688 --> 38:13.827
I thought you was gonna have
to come look for us, Phil.

38:13.862 --> 38:15.516
-Right?
-You did good.
-Yeah.

38:15.550 --> 38:18.034
-You got any energy left?
-You did good.

38:18.068 --> 38:19.378
-No, we got energy, Phil.
-Don't worry about it.

38:19.413 --> 38:21.896
Well, you'll need the energy
'cause you're not last.

38:21.931 --> 38:23.481
You are team number nine.

38:23.516 --> 38:26.240
[sighs, laughs]

38:26.275 --> 38:27.827
You got me crying
for nothing, Phil.

38:27.862 --> 38:29.447
I-I didn't get you crying
for nothing.

38:29.481 --> 38:30.757
We want to get you fired up.

38:30.793 --> 38:32.137
The question I have is,

38:32.172 --> 38:33.896
can you figure out
how to stay in this race?

38:33.931 --> 38:35.413
We have to, Phil.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.516
This leg was the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life,

38:37.550 --> 38:38.965
and I've done some things.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.481
I think it was important for us
to push through

38:41.516 --> 38:43.965
because we're always telling
our kids to never give up.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.793
Like, how dare I get up here

38:45.827 --> 38:47.000
in-in front of everyone
and give up?

38:47.034 --> 38:48.413
So that was...
never crossed our mind.

38:48.447 --> 38:50.724
We was get... we was gonna
get here, rain, sleet or snow.

38:50.757 --> 38:52.931
At least we're still racing.
Let's go.

39:02.516 --> 39:03.896
-Been a long night.
-Yes.

39:03.931 --> 39:07.585
Unfortunately, you are
the last team to arrive,

39:07.619 --> 39:10.378
and you have been eliminated
from the race.

39:10.413 --> 39:13.034
Ah. Sucks. Disappointing.

39:13.068 --> 39:16.034
We finished in the top three
yesterday,

39:16.068 --> 39:18.585
and we could have... we could
have done well, but I...

39:18.619 --> 39:21.000
-That's okay.
-Dad. Dad, you did amazing.

39:21.034 --> 39:24.137
I am so happy
that I did this with...

39:24.172 --> 39:25.688
And she's getting married soon.

39:25.724 --> 39:28.378
And this-this is
the best experience

39:28.413 --> 39:30.896
any father
could have hoped for.

39:30.931 --> 39:33.619
NATALIA:
Just spending this time
with my dad and

39:33.655 --> 39:35.309
experiencing all
these new things, like,

39:35.344 --> 39:38.034
just being competitive
and goofy with him--

39:38.068 --> 39:39.585
uh, it's just been great.

39:39.619 --> 39:41.413
We'll never forget this.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.206
We can notforget this.

39:43.240 --> 39:47.206
This is one of the best things
we have done in our lives.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.516
How many people can say
they've done...

39:49.550 --> 39:51.378
been on The Amazing Race?

39:51.413 --> 39:53.275
-Appreciate you being
on the race.
-Sure. Any time.

39:53.309 --> 39:56.827
-Look after each other.
I'm sure you will.
-Yes, we will.

40:05.068 --> 40:07.793
-What's going on?
-This is serious.

40:07.827 --> 40:09.757
KEOGHAN:
Welcome back
to the Cloisters, everybody.

40:09.793 --> 40:12.000
I've gathered you all back here

40:12.034 --> 40:14.585
because I have a very important
announcement to make.

40:14.619 --> 40:17.034
The Amazing Racehas traveled

40:17.068 --> 40:18.724
over a million miles
around the world,

40:18.757 --> 40:22.619
visited almost a hundred
countries, and from day one

40:22.655 --> 40:25.103
our number one priority
has been

40:25.137 --> 40:27.275
to make sure
that all of you are safe.

40:27.309 --> 40:31.585
Right now the world is dealing
with the coronavirus,

40:31.619 --> 40:34.034
and in order to keep you safe,

40:34.068 --> 40:36.206
we believe the best choice

40:36.240 --> 40:40.931
for all of us is
to suspend the race.

40:40.965 --> 40:43.413
In an ideal world,
the planets will align

40:43.447 --> 40:47.931
and we will pick this race
back up again

40:47.965 --> 40:51.688
and hopefully have all of you
starting the race again.

40:51.724 --> 40:54.447
We understand the sacrifices
that all of you have made.

40:54.481 --> 40:56.896
I know
to have you all come back

40:56.931 --> 41:00.103
and start back on this race
again would be challenging.

41:00.137 --> 41:01.757
CAYLA:
I think what's amazing

41:01.793 --> 41:04.516
about, like, traveling the world
is we meet so many people,

41:04.550 --> 41:06.793
and I think we've very quickly
become a family

41:06.827 --> 41:08.827
that we didn't even know
that we needed,

41:08.862 --> 41:11.793
um, in such a short amount
of time.

41:11.827 --> 41:15.275
So, I want to kick
all y'all's butts later, but...

41:15.309 --> 41:17.757
you're still my family.
[laughs]

41:17.793 --> 41:19.655
Nobody ever on
The Amazing Race

41:19.688 --> 41:22.447
has ever had an opportunity
to come on the race

41:22.481 --> 41:26.172
and then go and regroup
and come back better and faster

41:26.206 --> 41:27.793
than you were
in the beginning.

41:27.827 --> 41:31.240
You guys are one-of-a-kind, and
we want to see you get home safe

41:31.275 --> 41:33.688
to your families.
Thank you very much.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.655
Yay.

41:52.378 --> 41:54.619
[whooping]

41:56.862 --> 41:59.862
All right!

41:59.896 --> 42:01.481
Welcome back to
The Amazing Race.

42:01.516 --> 42:04.931
-[cheering]
-So, before we were interrupted,

42:04.965 --> 42:07.309
the world was waiting for you,
and I am pleased to tell you

42:07.344 --> 42:10.724
-that the world is waiting
for you once again.

42:42.103 --> 42:43.516
You will notice that there are

42:43.550 --> 42:45.103
some teams missing
in the lineup,

42:45.137 --> 42:48.793
so we have a few familiar faces
taking their place.

42:48.827 --> 42:50.619
Wow.
