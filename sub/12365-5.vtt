WEBVTT

00:09.469 --> 00:11.300
[Walt]
Thanks for coming, everybody.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.503
I really appreciate your time.

00:16.392 --> 00:19.509
So, what did you think
of the book?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.810
"Of Mice and Men,"

00:22.023 --> 00:23.559
it's Nobel Prize winner
John Steinbeck's

00:23.774 --> 00:25.184
classic American novel.

00:25.401 --> 00:28.814
It was published in 1937
to wide critical acclaim.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.645
Thank you, Monte.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.275
But I was hoping
to get people's, uh,

00:32.492 --> 00:34.357
personal reactions
to the book, so...

00:34.577 --> 00:36.067
[Shelby]
I hated it.

00:37.330 --> 00:40.447
It was too sad,
and everybody was so mean.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.281
Okay, um...

00:42.502 --> 00:43.912
[clears throat]

00:46.839 --> 00:48.625
Zachary, how about you?

00:48.841 --> 00:50.342
Uh...

00:50.551 --> 00:53.964
Uh, sorry, I'm a slow reader,
so I didn't finish.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.843
[door opens]

00:58.059 --> 00:59.595
-[Ruby] Hey.
-[Ferg] Hey.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.799
[door closes]

01:03.564 --> 01:04.519
-Ru by.
-[Ruby] Hm?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.097
What's Cady doing here?

01:08.027 --> 01:10.188
-Why don't you ask her yourself?
-Hey. Shh.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.611
I'm helping
with the deputy search.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.199
-[Ferg] Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.739
My dad hired me
to do some background checks

01:15.952 --> 01:18.238
on the people he's interviewing
in there.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.708
Are they in there right now?
[clears throat] Vic.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.878
-They all in there right now?
-Yeah, all eight of them.

01:34.554 --> 01:36.215
Did you meet them yet?
[groans]

01:36.430 --> 01:37.510
Vic.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.261
Did you meet them yet?
I mean, did they seem all right?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.763
It doesn't really matter
what I think, you know?

01:43.980 --> 01:46.016
Walt's gonna hire
whoever he wants anyway,

01:46.232 --> 01:47.847
probably someone
that doesn't threaten him.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.648
lam hungry.

01:49.860 --> 01:53.444
I'm gonna go to the Busy Bee
and get some food.

01:53.656 --> 01:54.771
Anyone else want anything?

01:54.991 --> 01:57.573
[Ruby]
Mnh-mnh. Thanks.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.112
Let's focus
on the end of the book,

02:03.332 --> 02:04.742
where George shoots Lennie.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.120
Spoiler alert for Zachary, huh?

02:07.837 --> 02:09.828
Well, I'll say the big maroon
had it coming.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.753
By the time I got to the end,

02:11.966 --> 02:14.173
l was so sick
of John Malkovich's voice

02:14.385 --> 02:17.377
that l was actually rooting
for him to get shot.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.264
[clears throat]

02:22.476 --> 02:23.977
What?

02:24.186 --> 02:27.178
John Malkovich played
the character in the movie.

02:27.398 --> 02:28.979
We're talking about the book,
so...

02:29.191 --> 02:30.522
[scoffs]
Of course.

02:31.235 --> 02:34.068
Okay, uh... as a deputy,

02:34.280 --> 02:37.272
how would you handle this
George/Lennie situation?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.231
Well, at the academy,
l was trained

02:39.452 --> 02:41.158
to take cover
at a safe distance.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.747
Ideally, l'd create a barrier
between myself and the shooter.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.696
I would command him to drop
his weapon.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.247
[knock on door]

02:48.336 --> 02:51.248
Walt, sorry,
we've got a situation.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.251
[Walt]
Excuse me.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.091
There's been a shooting

03:02.308 --> 03:04.264
at the home
of Brandi and Greg Collette.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.217
[Ferg]
The Collettes?

03:07.104 --> 03:08.560
Aren't they the military family

03:08.773 --> 03:10.434
that you and Vic
got called in on a while back?

03:10.650 --> 03:14.643
Yeah, Brandi Collette had a PTSD
episode, fired a weapon at us.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.853
Thankfully, Greg had it loaded
with blanks, so...

03:17.073 --> 03:19.029
Not this time.
Greg's been shot.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.195
-By Brandi?
-I don't know.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.907
Actually, Ferg, you stay here.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.082
Tell the applicants
I'm sorry to out things short.

03:31.295 --> 03:33.456
I'll see them
at the shooting range.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.508
How is he?

03:39.762 --> 03:41.423
Bullet passed underneath
his left clavicle.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.879
He's lost a lot of blood,

03:43.099 --> 03:44.714
but all things considered,
he's a lucky guy.

03:44.934 --> 03:45.969
Where's his wife, Brandi?

03:46.185 --> 03:47.345
Didn't know he had a wife.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.768
-Sheriff, we got to go.
-l'm coming with you.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.481
[monitor beeping]

03:51.691 --> 03:53.977
[siren wailing]

03:56.112 --> 03:58.228
[radio chatter]

04:01.784 --> 04:03.445
Greg, did Brandi do this?

04:05.496 --> 04:07.361
No, she didn't.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.493
Okay, if it wasn't Brandi,
who was it?

04:11.961 --> 04:14.418
Some guy kicked in my door
while I was sleeping.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.870
Did you get a look at him?

04:16.090 --> 04:17.205
Sort of. Uh...

04:17.425 --> 04:20.292
He had a, um -- a hoodie on.

04:20.511 --> 04:25.096
A red bandana covered his face.

04:25.266 --> 04:29.259
White guy, sounded young,
maybe drugged out.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.729
What did he want?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.439
I don't know, okay?

04:32.648 --> 04:34.684
I was gonna let him take
whatever he was looking for

04:34.900 --> 04:36.765
just so he would leave.

04:38.195 --> 04:41.483
And then he found Brandi's
engagement ring, and...

04:41.699 --> 04:43.530
couldn't have that.

04:43.743 --> 04:46.860
So I tried to grab it,
and he pulled out a gun.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.491
I didn't care.
| just -- I went after it.

04:49.707 --> 04:54.121
Then he shot me, and then he
ran away with the ring.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.076
So, where was Brandi
during all this?

04:56.297 --> 04:57.537
She okay?

05:00.009 --> 05:01.545
She's dead, Sheriff.

05:03.179 --> 05:05.215
She killed herself
two months ago.

05:06.182 --> 05:07.797
I had no idea.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.009
I'm sorry.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.568
You, uh...

05:23.073 --> 05:25.109
Can you describe
that engagement ring for me?

05:26.786 --> 05:28.822
Green agate, set in silver.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.623
Brandi found the stone

05:31.832 --> 05:33.788
while we were camping
near Delaney Rim.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.368
[exhales sharply]
It's got her name.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.499
It's engraved on the inside.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.467
I'm gonna find
that ring for you, Greg...

05:45.679 --> 05:47.465
and whoever did this.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.263
Sheriff, I think
you're gonna want to hear this.

05:50.476 --> 05:51.807
[Vic]
A second robbery?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.759
[Ruby]
Yeah, at the TaII-T Warehouse

05:53.979 --> 05:55.059
and another gunshot victim.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.523
Hand me that mike.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.400
Vic, where are you?

06:02.613 --> 06:05.025
[siren wailing]

06:06.700 --> 06:08.691
[tires screech]

06:09.954 --> 06:12.240
Have the doctor call me
as soon as he's out of surgery.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.572
[siren beeps, wails]

06:28.389 --> 06:31.131
[siren wailing]

06:41.485 --> 06:43.191
Who called this one in?

06:43.487 --> 06:45.899
The victim, a security guard
named Lee McKinnon.

07:02.006 --> 07:03.587
Sheriff's department!

07:03.757 --> 07:05.372
[Lee]
I'm over here!

07:12.516 --> 07:13.631
They got me in the leg.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.091
They? How many?

07:16.312 --> 07:18.303
Three, I think, maybe four.

07:18.522 --> 07:19.807
They're gone now.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.231
l was going around
checking temps,

07:23.444 --> 07:25.230
and that's when
I heard something.

07:25.446 --> 07:28.438
And I came around the corner
here, and I saw them.

07:28.657 --> 07:29.863
[Walt]
What did they look like?

07:30.367 --> 07:31.698
They were all in black,

07:31.911 --> 07:33.947
ski masks, looked professional.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.654
Sol pulled my sidearm,
and before I knew it,

07:36.874 --> 07:38.614
we were exchanging shots.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.542
[Vic]
Did you hit any of them?

07:41.754 --> 07:43.915
I sure as hell would hope so.
They were all right there.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.838
They were taking boxes
off our Casper shipment.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.416
[Walt]
These all pharmaceuticals?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.217
Yeah.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.387
If you see any painkillers,
you can grab me some.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.135
Paramedics are on their way.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.512
-[Lee] Aah!
-[Walt] How's that leg looking?

07:59.063 --> 08:00.553
You stitch that yourself?

08:01.482 --> 08:04.895
Aah.
Uh, no, one of them did it.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.981
[inhales sharply]

08:08.197 --> 08:09.858
[shudders]

08:15.579 --> 08:17.695
[siren wails]

08:18.749 --> 08:20.614
Two armed robberies in one day?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.416
They got to be connected.
-[Walt] Maybe.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.745
Lee McKinnon shot those robbers
at close range.

08:25.965 --> 08:27.796
Call the hospitals
and the local clinics.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.215
See if any gunshot victims
have shown up.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.418
Have Ruby call every pawnshop
in the area.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.970
See if anyone brought in
a green agate engagement ring

08:35.182 --> 08:36.342
set in silver.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.934
You looking to propose
to someone?

08:38.143 --> 08:41.101
It was, uh,
Brandi Collette's ring.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.644
Greg got shot trying to stop

08:42.856 --> 08:43.845
someone stealing it, so...

08:44.233 --> 08:45.222
Green agate must be worth

08:45.442 --> 08:47.057
a lot more than I suspected.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.359
Brandi killed herself
two months ago.

08:50.322 --> 08:54.065
Shit. Okay.
I'll call Ruby from the road.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.447
Ferg, I want you to thoroughly
process these crime scenes,

08:57.663 --> 08:59.244
this place
and the Collette home.

08:59.999 --> 09:02.285
Tell me the differences
and the similarities.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.914
That should tell us if these
two robberies are connected.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.134
Ferg.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.760
Call Cady for me.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.262
On it.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.349
-Why?
-I need a ride.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.530
Yeah, that's right.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.284
ls Greg Collette out of surgery?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.372
Anybody there to be with him
when he comes 'round?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.749
When are the visiting hours?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.411
Okay, thanks.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.495
[beep]

09:50.716 --> 09:52.047
So, uh...

09:53.260 --> 09:55.421
You dig up anything
on these candidates

09:55.596 --> 09:56.711
I ought to know about?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.386
Dad, do you feel like

09:58.599 --> 10:01.341
maybe you're rushing
this a little?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.175
You've been through a lot.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.260
Thanks, but I'm good.

10:05.481 --> 10:07.017
Now, what have you found?

10:08.734 --> 10:11.817
Well, two of your applicants
have minor criminal records,

10:12.029 --> 10:13.690
and one of them
has a medical history

10:13.906 --> 10:15.191
that's a little disconcerting.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.567
Okay.

10:22.915 --> 10:27.158
Now, I hope you never need to
use your weapon on this job.

10:27.377 --> 10:31.711
But if you do,
I hope you don't miss.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.583
Treat this like the real thing.

10:36.678 --> 10:37.758
All right.

10:38.764 --> 10:39.799
Ready.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.052
Aim.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.519
Fire.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.652
Not bad, Theo.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.733
Thanks, Sheriff.

11:03.038 --> 11:07.077
Monte, | get the feeling
you may have done this before.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.247
Yes, sir.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.632
Something wrong, Zachary?

11:21.723 --> 11:24.556
You said to treat this
like the real thing, right?

11:24.768 --> 11:26.224
Well, in reality,
at this distance,

11:26.436 --> 11:27.846
that bear's no threat to me,

11:28.063 --> 11:29.223
so I prefer not to shoot it.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.857
Actually, that's not a bear.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.732
That's an escaped killer
in a bear suit.

11:37.948 --> 11:42.032
He's got an AK-47
aimed straight at you.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.326
[shell clinks]

11:51.044 --> 11:52.204
Nice shooting.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.171
[Vic]
Walt.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.964
So, if Lee McKinnon did hit
one of those warehouse robbers,

12:05.184 --> 12:06.640
they didn't go to a hospital
or clinic.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.467
Nobody's been admitted
with a gunshot wound

12:08.687 --> 12:10.928
except for McKinnon
and Greg Collette.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.604
What about Brandi's ring?

12:12.816 --> 12:14.272
Ruby's still making calls,

12:14.484 --> 12:15.644
but I just got off
the phone with Ferg.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.397
He said 12 boxes
of pharmaceuticals

12:17.613 --> 12:18.773
were stolen from the warehouse,

12:18.989 --> 12:20.354
all from the same
Casper shipment.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.657
Zoloft, Children's Advil,
and pseudo-ephedrine.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.405
-Pseudoephedrine.
-[Vic] Pseudoephedrine.

12:25.621 --> 12:26.861
Pseudoephedrine?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.581
Meth cooks use it.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.365
So I've been thinking,
home invasion, stolen pills,

12:31.585 --> 12:32.665
ring a bell?

12:32.878 --> 12:35.870
-Yeah. U nfortunately.
-Yeah.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.341
Cady, uh, tell the candidates

12:38.550 --> 12:40.541
that didn't check out
they didn't make the cut,

12:40.761 --> 12:42.092
except for the medical case.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.135
I'm not quite ready
to cut him loose yet.

12:44.348 --> 12:45.554
Okay.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.482
[hip-hop music playing]

13:00.239 --> 13:02.230
I'll do the talking.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.314
You head inside
and look for the missing drugs

13:04.534 --> 13:06.115
and Brandi's ring.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.911
[Vic] Let's hope for their sakes
we only find drugs.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.865
-Boys.
-[music stops]

13:14.086 --> 13:16.452
Yo, bae, that's trespassing
without a warrant.

13:16.672 --> 13:19.163
You're on probation.
We don't need a warrant.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.207
You still peddling stolen drugs
these days?

13:22.427 --> 13:23.837
-You mean magazines?
-No!

13:24.054 --> 13:25.635
-Come on!
-I don't.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.591
Like you said,
we're on probation.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.678
Selling drugs would wreck
that shit. So we're clean.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.932
Who's taken over
your drug trade?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.399
No one.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.518
You've completely cleaned up

13:37.734 --> 13:39.599
Absaroka County, Sheriff.

13:39.820 --> 13:44.689
And yet someone just robbed
a warehouse at gunpoint,

13:44.908 --> 13:48.071
stole entire cases
of pseudoephedrine, Zoloft,

13:48.287 --> 13:50.243
and Children's Advil.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.241
And someone ripped offjewelry

13:52.457 --> 13:54.197
from a grieving widower
after shooting him.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.249
I'm thinking the two of you

13:56.461 --> 13:57.997
are about stupid enough
to do both.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.209
Look what I just found
under one of the couch cushions.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.961
[chuckles]

14:03.176 --> 14:05.087
Well, that's a violation
of your probation,

14:05.304 --> 14:09.843
which mean I'm calling
your probation officer right now

14:10.058 --> 14:11.559
unless I believe
every single word

14:11.768 --> 14:12.883
that comes out of your mouths.

14:13.103 --> 14:14.468
We're not lying.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.015
Our proby's a hard-ass.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.392
We wouldn't risk
peddling Z-Ioft.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.893
What about the pseudoephedrine?

14:20.110 --> 14:21.441
There's no money is pseudo,

14:21.653 --> 14:22.642
not unless you cook
that shit up.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.444
And what if you can?

14:24.656 --> 14:26.157
[sighs]

14:26.366 --> 14:29.153
You can flip a package of pseudo
for three grams of meth,

14:29.369 --> 14:30.449
maybe sell it for 100 bucks

14:30.662 --> 14:32.118
to some dumb-ass
casino tourists.

14:32.331 --> 14:34.322
But we don't know how to cook
that redneck shit.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.621
No.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.256
And, Sheriff?

14:47.012 --> 14:49.674
That's actually my nana's gun.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.051
[Walt]
Your nana's gun?

14:52.267 --> 14:56.431
You tell your nana to come down
to the station and pick it up.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.612
So, those idiots are right
about meth's street --

15:15.832 --> 15:18.118
-Hey.
-...street value.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.496
Each one of those cases
of pseudoephedrine

15:20.712 --> 15:23.203
could be worth
tens of thousands of dollars.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.873
What did you find
at the crime scenes?

15:26.093 --> 15:27.754
Found some slugs
at the warehouse

15:27.969 --> 15:29.095
and at Greg Collette's home.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.172
I figure
we should run ballistics

15:30.389 --> 15:31.799
on all of them.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.222
Even though the robbery
at the Collette home

15:34.434 --> 15:36.095
looks like a random
smash-and-grab,

15:36.311 --> 15:38.472
I decided to make some calls
on Greg Collette anyway,

15:38.688 --> 15:40.770
see if he has any enemies
or any recent run-ins.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.233
Is that why you
brought Travis in?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.728
Uh... no.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.561
Uh... he brought himself in.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.442
Said he wanted to talk
to you in private.

15:49.658 --> 15:50.738
I have no idea what about.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.066
Anyway, Greg Collette

15:52.285 --> 15:53.661
did have a big blowup

15:53.870 --> 15:55.121
at the VA. clinic in Sheridan

15:55.330 --> 15:57.491
directed at a psychiatrist --

15:57.707 --> 16:00.039
Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.617
Nice work.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.164
Travis.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.626
Uh... hi.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.833
-What are you doing here?
-I'm honored to apply

16:09.052 --> 16:10.337
for the job of deputy, sir.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.090
I-I know me and this department

16:12.305 --> 16:13.636
may have gotten off
on the wrong foot,

16:13.849 --> 16:15.009
but I really do believe

16:15.225 --> 16:16.055
that I'd make
a strong candidate.

16:16.268 --> 16:17.553
Aside from pulling a gun

16:17.769 --> 16:18.849
on one of my deputies

16:19.062 --> 16:20.438
and later helping him kidnap

16:20.647 --> 16:22.433
and drug a Cheyenne man.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.560
Well, to be fair,
I did come clean on both

16:24.776 --> 16:26.061
of those errors in judgment.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.984
So I do have honesty
going for me.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.279
Also, I've, uh, attached
this article.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.107
It says that a lot of cops
would have become criminals

16:34.327 --> 16:36.067
if they hadn't turned
to law enforcement.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.573
So, you're saying
if I don't hire you,

16:37.789 --> 16:39.029
you're gonna commit more crimes.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.831
[laughs]
Not any felonies.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.419
As you can see, I, uh --

16:43.628 --> 16:45.004
I've never done
any real jail time,

16:45.213 --> 16:46.202
and I've never been convicted
of anything

16:46.423 --> 16:47.663
other than the misdemeanor.

16:49.926 --> 16:53.635
You actually stapled
your rap sheet to your résumé?

16:53.847 --> 16:55.963
My greatest weakness happens
to be my greatest strength.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.548
I know where the bad guys are.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.509
I know how they think,
and I'm a quick draw.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.889
[chuckles]

17:02.105 --> 17:03.970
[pen clicks]

17:04.191 --> 17:05.271
Uh...

17:06.026 --> 17:08.017
I'm in the middle
of an investigation, so...

17:08.236 --> 17:11.319
-All right.
-I'm gonna drive to Sheridan,

17:11.531 --> 17:12.771
talk to that psychiatrist

17:12.991 --> 17:14.902
that Greg Collette
had the run-in with.

17:16.453 --> 17:19.866
Uh, I want you to see
if anyone's buying or stealing

17:20.081 --> 17:22.572
the other ingredients you need
to cook meth in bulk.

17:22.792 --> 17:23.918
Okay.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.635
Well, I think that went better
than expected.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.924
[indistinct conversations]

17:50.862 --> 17:52.568
[door closes]

17:52.739 --> 17:54.195
[man]
Come on.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.407
Thanks, but no thanks.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.130
Sheriff Longmire.

18:13.343 --> 18:14.458
Yeah.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.718
Dr. Monaghan,
let me help you with that.

18:24.938 --> 18:25.927
[Donna]
Oh, thank you.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.767
-What happened?
-[sighs]

18:27.983 --> 18:31.601
Well, it was either a temper
tantrum or a breakthrough.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.105
It's hard to tell sometimes.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.356
And the name is Donna.

18:34.573 --> 18:35.562
Donna. Right.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.942
Yeah.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.860
Well, I do have another patient
in about five minutes, so...

18:41.079 --> 18:42.580
Of course.
I'll get right to it.

18:42.789 --> 18:46.247
Do you know a Durant man
named Greg Collette?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.791
Yes, he reached out to me

18:49.004 --> 18:51.962
a few months ago
about his wife, Brandi.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.583
She was, uh...

18:53.800 --> 18:55.301
She was having some
pretty terrible flashbacks

18:55.510 --> 18:57.296
after coming home from Iraq.

18:57.512 --> 18:58.843
Yeah. Yeah, I experienced one
of them firsthand, so...

18:59.055 --> 19:00.636
Well, then you know that she

19:00.849 --> 19:03.431
was in need of immediate
psychiatric care.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.680
But, unfortunately,
like too many veterans,

19:06.896 --> 19:09.023
she wouldn't come in here
for treatment.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.893
So at Greg's request,

19:11.109 --> 19:13.225
I took the mobile unit
down to Durant to see her,

19:13.445 --> 19:16.733
but she refused evaluation,
so...

19:16.948 --> 19:18.279
How did Greg react to that?

19:18.491 --> 19:20.072
Well, he was thankful
for my efforts.

19:20.285 --> 19:22.071
[chuckles]
I'm sorry.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.199
Why are you asking me all these
questions about Greg Collette?

19:25.415 --> 19:28.248
Because someone broke into his
home this morning and shot him.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.376
Well, is he okay?

19:31.588 --> 19:32.998
I hope so.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.126
Anyway, I understand
that you and Greg

19:35.342 --> 19:37.207
had a bit of a confrontation.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.841
Well, I -- Yes.
[stammers]

19:43.058 --> 19:45.640
It was about three months ago.
He, uh --

19:45.852 --> 19:47.592
He drove down here and demanded

19:47.812 --> 19:50.349
that I give him some
anti-depressants for Brandi.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.066
What did you say?

19:52.275 --> 19:54.982
I said the only thing
I could say -- no.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.060
Without an evaluation,
l-l didn't know

19:57.280 --> 19:58.941
if Brandi was suffering
from PTSD

19:59.157 --> 20:01.113
or a traumatic brain injury
or both.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.987
You know,
there was no way of knowing

20:03.203 --> 20:05.068
what kind of medication
to give her, so...

20:05.288 --> 20:07.244
And did that make Greg angry?

20:07.457 --> 20:09.948
Yes, it made him very livid.

20:10.168 --> 20:14.252
He, uh, told me that if I
didn't give him the pills

20:14.464 --> 20:18.582
that, um, Brandi
would kill herself.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.134
But there was really nothing
that I could do.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.712
At that point,
my hands were tied, so...

20:23.932 --> 20:26.344
Well, Greg was right
about Brandi, you know?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.174
She did kill herself.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.511
Do you actually think
that I don't know that, Sheriff?

20:32.357 --> 20:35.190
Do you imagine that that doesn't
keep me awake at night?

20:37.070 --> 20:41.484
Did you know that 22 veterans
kill themselves every day?

20:44.327 --> 20:46.113
You know, I had no idea
when I took this job

20:46.329 --> 20:47.990
that it was gonna be
so impossible

20:48.206 --> 20:51.369
for me to give these people
the kind of help that they need.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.660
A soldier does not hesitate

20:55.880 --> 20:58.132
to get the shrapnel
removed from his leg.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.753
But if it's the brain
that's injured,

21:00.969 --> 21:03.756
you can't get them
to set foot in here.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.548
They think that it makes them
weak or something.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.098
And just...

21:09.310 --> 21:12.768
So what do they do?
They -- They suffer.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.645
And they self-medicate.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.189
And sometimes,
like Brandi Collette,

21:16.401 --> 21:17.641
they kill themselves.

21:18.862 --> 21:21.319
And if they actually do
work up the courage

21:21.531 --> 21:23.192
to come in here, well,
then they find

21:23.408 --> 21:24.864
that we are so underfunded

21:25.076 --> 21:27.818
and that the red tape
is so damn thick,

21:28.037 --> 21:29.447
it's all just starting to feel

21:29.622 --> 21:31.362
like some, you know,
sadistic joke, but...

21:34.377 --> 21:35.583
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.831
It's okay. It's okay.
I've got it.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.378
I'm sorry.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.011
[sighs]

21:44.220 --> 21:45.426
I'm sorry.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.764
It's uh...

21:46.973 --> 21:49.134
It's been a long week.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.557
So...
[clears throat]

21:51.770 --> 21:53.101
I really do have
a lot more patients,

21:53.313 --> 21:54.428
so if you don't have
any more questions...

21:54.647 --> 21:55.602
Where were you this morning

21:55.815 --> 21:56.850
just after dawn?

21:57.066 --> 21:58.681
I was on the road

21:58.902 --> 22:00.858
back from Cumberland County
in the mobile unit.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.651
-Why?
-I'm just trying

22:02.864 --> 22:04.604
to piece together
all the information that I can.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.116
-All right.
-Thank you.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.409
[Donna]
Of course.

22:19.881 --> 22:23.840
Deputy Ferguson here
has examined two crime scenes,

22:24.052 --> 22:26.714
one victim
at the Collette home invasion,

22:26.930 --> 22:30.172
one at the Tall-T Warehouse
robbery. Ferg?

22:30.391 --> 22:32.882
All right, Greg Collette
was shot with a .38

22:33.102 --> 22:35.184
by a single robber in his home.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.933
Later that same morning,
Lee McKinnon

22:38.149 --> 22:41.141
was shot with a 9mm in his leg
while confronting a group

22:41.361 --> 22:43.522
of three to four
professional-looking thieves.

22:43.738 --> 22:46.650
Now, McKinnon returned fire
with his .38,

22:46.866 --> 22:49.733
leaving these bullet holes
in the warehouse boxes.

22:51.538 --> 22:56.328
So, you think
these crimes are related?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.208
They got to be related.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.081
This is small-town Wyoming,
right?

23:01.297 --> 23:02.673
What are the odds

23:02.882 --> 23:04.622
that there are two heist crews
working out here?

23:04.843 --> 23:07.425
Wait, you're saying
that these perps

23:07.637 --> 23:09.298
completely altered their M.O.s?

23:09.514 --> 23:11.721
Why would they suddenly change
things up between crimes?

23:11.933 --> 23:14.470
Maybe they want
to throw us off their scent.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.768
[Walt]
Zachary, what do you think?

23:16.980 --> 23:21.019
I think these two .38 slugs
are maybe from the same gun.

23:21.234 --> 23:25.193
Both got six lands and grooves
and a left twist.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.520
[Premo]
What does that mean?

23:27.657 --> 23:29.522
That means that Zachary noticed

23:29.742 --> 23:31.607
the same thing
as Deputy Ferguson.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.693
We're doing some further
ballistic tests,

23:33.913 --> 23:35.619
but there's a good chance
that Lee McKinnon's gun

23:35.832 --> 23:37.572
was used at the
Collette home invasion, so...

23:37.792 --> 23:39.498
And did you recover
McKinnon's gun?

23:39.711 --> 23:42.669
No. McKinnon told us the robbers
took it after he was shot.

23:42.881 --> 23:44.621
But Collette was shot first.

23:44.841 --> 23:47.378
How would he be shot
with the security guard's gun?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.926
[Travis]
Easy. The guard was in on it.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.594
See, the security guard,
he rips off

23:51.806 --> 23:52.921
this Collette fellow first,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.805
and then he goes to work
his shift,

23:55.018 --> 23:56.599
and then he stages
a fake robbery

23:56.811 --> 23:58.347
to make it look like
it's a crime spree.

23:58.563 --> 24:01.100
I mean, he's a security guard,
right? I hate those guys.

24:01.316 --> 24:02.977
Fake wannabe rent-a-cops.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.183
What are you doing here?

24:05.403 --> 24:06.768
Just winning you over.

24:06.988 --> 24:08.194
I mean, you never said no
yesterday.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.522
Okay, then. No.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.154
Come on, you got to
at least give me a chance.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.860
I don't.

24:17.832 --> 24:18.947
Okay.

24:24.923 --> 24:27.505
So, uh, there's another way

24:27.717 --> 24:30.834
of, uh, thinking about this.

24:31.054 --> 24:33.261
Maybe the warehouse
was robbed first

24:33.473 --> 24:35.714
before the Collette
home invasion.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.300
Warehouse thieves shoot
Lee McKinnon,

24:38.519 --> 24:40.430
steal his gun,
hit the Collette house.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.514
Well, then why did the 911 calls
come in a different order?

24:43.733 --> 24:47.692
If this security guard McKinnon
really is an inside man,

24:47.904 --> 24:49.394
after the warehouse robbery,

24:49.614 --> 24:51.980
he lets his cohorts shoot him
in the leg.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.282
Then he would have waited
to call 911

24:54.494 --> 24:55.779
to let his crew get away.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.860
Meanwhile, they use
Lee McKinnon's gun

24:58.081 --> 25:00.697
in another robbery
in another part of town.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.578
Didn't Trey and Jelly
have an inside partner

25:02.794 --> 25:04.125
in their prescription-drug ring?

25:04.337 --> 25:06.669
Yes, they did.
Paid off a pharmacist

25:06.881 --> 25:09.372
to give them the names of people
with prescriptions.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.133
All four cases
of stolen pseudoephedrine

25:13.346 --> 25:15.632
showed up in the Dumpster
behind Durant Pharmacy

25:15.848 --> 25:18.840
right after you and I
questioned Jelly and Trey.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.766
That's got to be enough
for an arrest.

25:20.979 --> 25:23.812
No. Everything we have
is still circumstantial.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.481
Unless one of our shooting
victims can give us an ID.

25:28.778 --> 25:29.938
Greg.

25:30.154 --> 25:31.610
Sheriff.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.563
Are they taking half-decent care
of you in here?

25:33.783 --> 25:35.774
Uh, no complaints so far,
you know.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.404
Uh... [clears throat]

25:37.620 --> 25:39.030
Marc, this is
Sheriff Walt Longmire,

25:39.247 --> 25:41.078
who I was telling you about.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.453
Sheriff, this is my friend
Sergeant Marc Van Zandt.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.159
Actually, it's
retired Sergeant Van Zandt.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.664
It's nice to meet you, Sheriff.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.006
Greg tells me you're
hunting down the asshole

25:49.215 --> 25:50.955
that shot him
and stole Brandi's ring.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.666
Well, I'm certainly working
on it.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.422
Did you know Brandi?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.839
[Marc]
Yes, sir. Very well.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.218
If it was anyone
other than Brandi

26:00.435 --> 26:02.471
driving our supply truck
through Basra,

26:02.687 --> 26:04.097
I don't think I'd be here.

26:04.439 --> 26:06.304
So when Greg called me
and told me about the robbery,

26:06.524 --> 26:08.139
I drove up from Fort Collins
to make sure

26:08.359 --> 26:09.690
they were taking care of him.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.278
No.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.318
We're doing everything we can,
so, uh...

26:14.323 --> 26:18.157
I got a couple of suspects
I think might be involved.

26:18.369 --> 26:19.745
Greg, if you feel up to it,

26:19.912 --> 26:22.870
you want to take a look
at their mug shots?

26:23.082 --> 26:24.117
Yeah, sure, let's...

26:24.333 --> 26:25.618
Here you go.
[clears throat]

26:27.420 --> 26:29.081
Only a mother
could love them, huh?

26:29.297 --> 26:31.834
[Greg]
[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah.

26:32.842 --> 26:35.675
You recognize either of them?

26:36.763 --> 26:38.299
I don't know.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.175
Like I said, I was sleeping
when they busted in.

26:40.391 --> 26:42.006
They had their faces covered.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.012
I wish I could, but sorry.

26:44.228 --> 26:46.435
No, no, makes sense.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.562
If you could hear
the robber's voice,

26:48.775 --> 26:51.232
you think that
may make things easier?

26:52.195 --> 26:54.311
-It might, right?
-Yeah.

26:55.031 --> 26:55.986
Okay.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.110
Hey, who you taking me to see?

26:58.910 --> 27:01.242
It's a guy named Greg Collette.

27:01.454 --> 27:04.491
He was also shot during
a robbery yesterday.

27:11.255 --> 27:14.122
[Walt] Mr. McKinnon,
thanks forjoining us.

27:14.342 --> 27:16.628
I was hoping
that you and Mr. Collette here

27:16.844 --> 27:18.300
could go through
some of the details

27:18.513 --> 27:20.879
of your assailants with us.

27:21.099 --> 27:24.432
That way, we might be able
to piece together a description.

27:24.644 --> 27:29.354
Do you recognize
either of these two men?

27:30.358 --> 27:31.973
You know, it was dark,

27:32.193 --> 27:34.400
and the fellas
kept their masks on.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.398
I don't think
I could really recognize

27:36.614 --> 27:38.525
any of the people involved.

27:40.535 --> 27:43.322
Not even the one who sewed up
your gunshot wound?

27:49.168 --> 27:52.456
How long did it take for you
to call 911 after you got shot?

27:52.672 --> 27:56.005
It's pretty hard to pin down.
Um...

27:56.217 --> 27:58.583
You know, I think I blacked out
in there somewhere.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.633
I don't even remember
being sewn up.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.680
[Marc]
Fog of war.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.300
Excuse me?

28:07.520 --> 28:08.726
Well, in a crisis, our brains

28:08.938 --> 28:10.394
can only handle so much
information.

28:10.606 --> 28:13.439
Our memory of the details
gets all fogged up.

28:13.651 --> 28:15.562
I saw it happen
all the time in Iraq.

28:24.078 --> 28:26.364
There was something weird going
on in there, wasn't there?

28:26.581 --> 28:28.117
Lee McKinnon
seemed awfully nervous

28:28.332 --> 28:30.072
around Sergeant Van Zandt.

28:31.085 --> 28:32.791
[Ferg]
Do you think he was in on it?

28:33.004 --> 28:34.289
[Wait]
I don't know.

28:35.089 --> 28:37.250
McKinnon's injury isn't severe.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.457
When's he scheduled
to be released?

28:39.677 --> 28:40.666
[Ferg]
Tomorrow.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.047
[Walt]
I got a job for you.

28:42.263 --> 28:43.719
[rock music playing]

28:53.316 --> 28:56.604
Okay, so, it had nothing to do
with his physical health?

28:56.819 --> 28:57.899
Okay.

28:58.863 --> 29:00.728
Okay, thank you so much
for your help.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.325
Big crowd.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.039
Casino overflow.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.035
Well, thank you
for covering for me.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.333
No problem.
Something come up?

29:14.545 --> 29:16.331
Just a friend in need.

29:19.217 --> 29:20.753
Has Malachi put you on retainer?

29:20.968 --> 29:22.469
Yeah, he offered me six figures.

29:22.678 --> 29:23.963
I turned him down, of course,

29:24.180 --> 29:25.590
so that I could do
some background checks

29:25.806 --> 29:27.967
on my dad's deputy applicants.

29:32.355 --> 29:33.686
Is he one of the candidates?

29:33.898 --> 29:35.354
Yeah.
Why? You know him?

29:38.444 --> 29:41.686
I have encountered
Theo Pemberton several times,

29:41.906 --> 29:44.443
and each could be described
as "harrowing."

29:44.659 --> 29:47.492
Okay, good to know.
Thank you.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.284
Your shirt's ripped.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.040
So it is.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.536
I should go change.

30:01.008 --> 30:04.296
U Love don't satisfy me J‘J‘

30:04.512 --> 30:08.926
J'J' 'Cause I'm leaving
with a smile on my face J‘J‘

30:09.767 --> 30:13.806
N You know I ain't that easy J‘J‘

30:14.021 --> 30:16.888
J‘J‘ Sometimes it's just so hard J‘J‘

30:18.192 --> 30:21.935
J‘J‘ I'm just looking for something
to please me If

30:22.154 --> 30:24.236
N You know I want it J‘J‘

30:24.448 --> 30:26.564
[ringing]

30:31.038 --> 30:33.700
[woman]
Hello? Hello?

30:33.916 --> 30:35.998
Anyone there?
Hello?

30:37.878 --> 30:39.254
[scoffs]

30:42.800 --> 30:47.009
J‘J‘ Some good loving with me J‘J‘

30:47.221 --> 30:50.588
J‘J‘ Some good loving with me J‘J‘

30:51.559 --> 30:54.346
J‘J‘ Some good loving J‘J‘

31:02.069 --> 31:05.527
J‘J‘ Back-door screen is slamming J‘J‘

31:06.198 --> 31:07.324
[Vic]
Hmm.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.399
So, I take it
round two with Walt

31:09.618 --> 31:11.404
didn't go as well as expected?

31:14.915 --> 31:17.372
You know, I really don't need
any shit right now.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.367
No shit. Just beer.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.585
Did you really think
he was gonna hire you, though?

31:27.887 --> 31:29.878
I thought he'd give me a chance.

31:31.057 --> 31:34.515
-You have a record, Travis.
-Misdemeanors.

31:34.727 --> 31:38.185
Dumb mistakes. Or maybe you
don't have any of those.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.434
You know, I may not come
from money like Branch did.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.356
But I'll tell you one thing --
I'm a much better person

31:45.863 --> 31:47.774
But would you have made
a better deputy?

31:50.743 --> 31:52.859
You know, me and Branch,

31:53.079 --> 31:55.161
we played football ever since
we were little kids,

31:55.373 --> 31:56.704
and he was always
the starting QB.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.998
And me,
I was just a blocking back.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.667
But when we graduated
from high school,

32:01.879 --> 32:04.120
guess who went on
to play Division I football.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.960
It sure as hell
wasn't Branch Connally.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.632
And why's that?

32:08.844 --> 32:10.550
Because I played harder
than he did

32:10.805 --> 32:12.636
and because I cared more
about helping my team

32:12.848 --> 32:14.258
than padding my own stats.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.761
You know, that's --
that's the thing

32:16.936 --> 32:19.143
that pisses me off
about this the most.

32:19.355 --> 32:21.721
It's that I can accept going out
there on the field and losing.

32:21.941 --> 32:25.104
What I can't accept is not even
being given a goddamn chance.

32:28.823 --> 32:32.065
J‘J‘ Don't let the sweet
still love me J‘J‘

32:32.910 --> 32:36.277
J‘J‘ Just got to try again J‘J‘

32:37.289 --> 32:40.622
If Next time, nothing
will stop me J‘J‘

32:41.502 --> 32:43.333
N You know you want it J‘J‘

32:56.225 --> 32:58.341
[Vic] Any word
on Brandi Collette's ring?

32:59.186 --> 33:00.847
Not yet.

33:01.063 --> 33:03.770
God help me if I find whoever
stole it.

33:04.650 --> 33:08.814
So, I've been thinking about
this warehouse robbery.

33:09.613 --> 33:12.195
Maybe the pseudoephedrine
wasn't actually the target.

33:12.408 --> 33:14.740
You think they were after
the Zoloft?

33:14.952 --> 33:17.159
Yeah, well,
I Googled it last night.

33:17.371 --> 33:20.534
Zoloft is prescribed a lot
for people with PTSD.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.580
If somebody knew about
Brandi's Collette's condition,

33:22.793 --> 33:24.169
they might have assumed
that she was on Zoloft

33:24.378 --> 33:25.959
while she was alive.

33:26.172 --> 33:29.414
And a cabinet full of pills
after she wasn't, so...

33:29.633 --> 33:30.668
Right.

33:32.887 --> 33:35.754
Yo, Sheriff, your narc sucks.

33:36.599 --> 33:38.840
You guys stop by to pick up
your pseudo?

33:39.059 --> 33:42.222
You guys couldn't break us,
so you sent your undercover pig

33:42.438 --> 33:45.100
to try and peddle off
some baggies of Z-loft on us

33:45.316 --> 33:46.431
at like half-price.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.265
I didn't send anybody
to do that.

33:48.486 --> 33:51.569
Well, Dwight Brisco sure as shit
looked and acted like a cop.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.111
We've already sent this
asshole's photo

33:53.324 --> 33:54.484
to everyone that we know.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.236
So Mr. 22 Jump Street's act

33:56.452 --> 33:57.942
is totally defunct.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.151
[Walt]
Oh, I see.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.907
Ah!

34:01.123 --> 34:03.785
Dude, that's his new phone.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.286
Which I can search,

34:05.503 --> 34:07.209
according to the terms
of your probation.

34:07.421 --> 34:10.458
If you've got any questions
about the legality of all this,

34:10.674 --> 34:12.505
we can call
your probation officer right now

34:12.718 --> 34:14.549
and go over the details.

34:23.062 --> 34:24.802
It's nice weather, huh?

34:28.317 --> 34:32.560
Once you slide that bag my way,
I will take it and walk away.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.317
You will find an envelope
full of money under the bench,

34:35.533 --> 34:36.943
as discussed.

34:58.389 --> 35:00.095
Shit.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.592
You seem to be in a hurry

35:01.809 --> 35:03.925
to sell off those pills
for cheap.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.344
Most street dealers I know

35:07.565 --> 35:09.556
make their money just selling
a little bit at a time.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.891
I'm not a dealer.
I'm an idiot.

35:18.075 --> 35:21.067
And a broke vet
with too many bills.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.778
Think that makes it okay
to peddle illegal drugs?

35:23.998 --> 35:25.829
l was desperate, okay?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.451
Every single job I apply for,

35:27.668 --> 35:29.283
every single job, you know
what they tell me?

35:29.503 --> 35:31.118
They say I don't have
the right education

35:31.338 --> 35:32.669
or the right experience.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.257
Apparently my military service,

35:34.466 --> 35:36.331
well, that's just a black mark
on my résumé.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.258
They all think that I've got
PTSD, TBI,

35:38.470 --> 35:40.426
or some other alphabet soup
that's gonna have me

35:40.639 --> 35:42.140
shooting up the place
or something.

35:42.891 --> 35:46.509
So, your solution is to steal
some Zoloft pills and sell them?

35:46.729 --> 35:49.015
I didn't -- I didn't steal them.

35:49.231 --> 35:50.220
I found them.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.147
Yes, like Columbus
found America.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.020
No, seriously.

35:55.321 --> 35:57.027
I heard about this church
on Highway 12,

35:57.239 --> 35:58.854
and they had a stash
of free anti-depressants

35:59.074 --> 36:00.530
for vets in need.

36:00.743 --> 36:02.734
So I went to the church,
I dug around. I found some.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.323
Hey, everybody assumes

36:05.497 --> 36:07.408
that I'm this
traumatized vet anyway.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.832
I might as well profit from it.

36:10.044 --> 36:12.626
So, who's distributing
these pills for free?

36:13.839 --> 36:15.204
I don't know.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.164
I just kind of assumed
it was Hector.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.636
Hector is dead.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.801
No, he's not, man.

36:22.014 --> 36:25.177
You ask anybody on the Res.
Hector lives.

36:36.236 --> 36:38.693
You do surveillance
like this often?

36:40.741 --> 36:42.356
Whenever Walt tells me to.

36:43.285 --> 36:45.947
Yeah, and he sounds like a boss
that you don't want to cross.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.028
[Ferg]
What do you mean?

36:48.248 --> 36:50.580
Well, didn't he hunt down
and gut the guy

36:50.793 --> 36:53.205
that murdered his wife
Charles Bronson-style?

36:53.420 --> 36:56.207
He was under federal
investigation for it, right?

36:56.423 --> 36:58.539
And cleared of any wrongdoing.

36:58.759 --> 36:59.748
Right.

37:00.761 --> 37:02.001
Hey, sorry, Ferg.

37:02.471 --> 37:04.302
I just want to know
what I'm getting myself into.

37:04.515 --> 37:06.676
You know what I mean?
My instructors at the academy,

37:06.892 --> 37:08.257
they were really by-the-book.

37:08.477 --> 37:09.512
Here, you can drive
whatever you want.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.843
You can wear whatever you want.

37:11.063 --> 37:12.553
Hell, it's like the sheriff

37:12.773 --> 37:15.685
cares more about books
than physical fitness.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.108
-You know what I mean?
-That's the third time.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.732
-Third time what?
-Third time that truck's driven

37:20.948 --> 37:22.484
past us.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.816
Is it a blue pickup with
Colorado plates, right?

37:25.035 --> 37:27.868
-Yep.
-Yeah, we've been made. [sighs]

37:28.080 --> 37:30.071
What, you think someone's trying
to get at Lee McKinnon?

37:30.290 --> 37:31.575
Well, if they are,
they're not gonna do it

37:31.792 --> 37:33.498
with me sitting here
in my uniform.

37:33.711 --> 37:35.451
Look, I'm gonna drive off,

37:35.671 --> 37:36.877
but I'm gonna leave
one of you here

37:37.089 --> 37:38.204
to see if that truck comes back.

37:38.424 --> 37:39.755
Yeah, I got it.

37:39.967 --> 37:42.800
Uh, don't take this
the wrong way, Monte,

37:43.011 --> 37:46.174
but you look exactly like a cop.

37:46.390 --> 37:47.596
[chuckles]

37:47.808 --> 37:48.923
Zachary's got this one.

37:49.143 --> 37:50.508
[Zachary]
All right.

37:50.728 --> 37:52.514
-Got to let him out.
-Sorry.

37:52.730 --> 37:53.890
Push it up.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.814
[Ferg]
Zachary.

37:59.361 --> 38:00.862
Take this.

38:01.071 --> 38:02.936
Pretend you're getting
signatures for a petition.

38:03.157 --> 38:04.021
All right.

38:04.241 --> 38:06.197
[engine turns over]

38:16.670 --> 38:18.126
[Vic] So, this Dwight Brisco guy

38:18.338 --> 38:20.124
said he got the anti-depressants
from inside here?

38:20.340 --> 38:21.955
He also said
Hector's still alive,

38:22.176 --> 38:24.758
so I'm not sure
how reliable he is.

38:27.431 --> 38:30.138
So, you're taking this search
pretty seriously.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.478
Of course
I'm taking it seriously.

38:33.687 --> 38:35.894
Two people have been shot.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.973
I was talking about
the deputy search.

38:41.361 --> 38:45.445
Well,
can't get it wrong again...

38:46.366 --> 38:47.742
...and hire another deputy

38:47.951 --> 38:50.283
who can't handle the strain
of the job.

38:51.288 --> 38:53.654
I noticed you've been pretty
quiet about the whole thing.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.077
What do you think
of the candidates?

38:57.085 --> 38:59.292
I think I should
just leave that up to you.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.538
I haven't been the best judge
of character lately.

39:04.301 --> 39:05.802
[notes play]

39:09.598 --> 39:11.839
[piano key clicks]

39:12.059 --> 39:13.265
[Clicking]

39:32.120 --> 39:35.032
So, we're looking for
a patriotic Robin Hood?

39:35.249 --> 39:36.455
Yeah.

39:36.667 --> 39:39.283
[boy imitating airplane]

39:49.471 --> 39:51.507
Gather up all the pills
that you find.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.811
[indistinct talking]

40:24.631 --> 40:25.882
Bible study?

40:26.091 --> 40:28.628
Support group for Army wives.

40:28.844 --> 40:31.335
Quack from the V.A.
organized it.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.254
[Rebecca]
Gareth wasn't even eating.

40:34.474 --> 40:38.513
He believes that tapeworms
were living under his scars

40:38.729 --> 40:40.685
and feeding off of everything
that he ate.

40:40.898 --> 40:42.229
How is Gareth now?

40:43.066 --> 40:45.899
Uh... better.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.353
He came with me today,
and he's eating again.

40:49.573 --> 40:51.154
Good.

40:51.617 --> 40:54.233
I still -- I still
don't feel comfortable

40:54.453 --> 40:56.284
leaving him alone with Eli.

40:56.496 --> 40:57.656
That's okay.

40:57.873 --> 41:01.707
But... he's better.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.626
Good.

41:05.422 --> 41:06.923
[Walt] You think these
had something to do

41:07.132 --> 41:08.497
with Gareth's recovery?

41:10.010 --> 41:11.250
What?

41:11.470 --> 41:13.301
[Wait] I found them
in the chapel.

41:13.513 --> 41:16.971
I'm guessing these are
the same anti-depressants

41:17.184 --> 41:19.596
that were recently stolen
from a local warehouse.

41:22.356 --> 41:24.142
Our husbands need those pills.

41:24.358 --> 41:27.771
Our families need those pills.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.567
Don't you wonder
how you got them?

41:29.780 --> 41:30.860
Why should we?

41:31.782 --> 41:34.569
Do you think civilians wonder
where they get their freedom?

41:34.785 --> 41:38.903
No, they just assume it's always
gonna be there -- for free.

41:39.122 --> 41:41.204
[Rebecca] Whoever stole
those pills is a saint.

41:41.416 --> 41:43.407
I'd like to thank them.

41:43.627 --> 41:45.413
You should say
your thank-yous now.

41:45.629 --> 41:47.836
There's a good chance that
person is here in this room.

41:48.048 --> 41:50.630
Look, I don't see any criminals
in here, Sheriff.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.798
Just some good people in need.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.717
[Vic] So, this looks like
it's all of them.

41:56.098 --> 41:57.963
We'll take them back
to the station.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.765
You, me, and Dr. Monaghan.

42:02.312 --> 42:04.177
Is this really necessary?

42:11.279 --> 42:14.817
Dr. Monaghan,
you've already made it clear

42:15.033 --> 42:17.274
that you're passionate
about your work

42:17.494 --> 42:20.782
and that you also feel
frustrated and helpless.

42:20.998 --> 42:22.989
Providing you with clear
motivation to get the pills

42:23.208 --> 42:24.744
to the men and women
you feel need them.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.245
Now we find you
at the very church

42:26.461 --> 42:27.962
where these pills
are being given away,

42:28.171 --> 42:29.786
not to mention
that the gunshot victim

42:30.007 --> 42:31.998
at the warehouse
where the pills were stolen

42:32.217 --> 42:34.208
received very capable first aid.

42:34.428 --> 42:36.419
As if trained by
a medical professional, right?

42:36.638 --> 42:38.503
Yes, I got the implication.

42:38.724 --> 42:40.555
Look, I understand your
suspicions, okay?

42:40.767 --> 42:42.428
But I am not involved in this.

42:42.644 --> 42:45.101
Although, in all honesty,
you know what? I wish I was.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.144
Because it's been such
a roaring success so far?

42:47.357 --> 42:49.268
No, because if I was involved,

42:49.484 --> 42:50.815
I could make sure
that these people

42:51.028 --> 42:53.235
are actually getting
the right medication.

42:53.447 --> 42:56.359
You know, it takes
hours of testing

42:56.575 --> 42:57.781
to make
a proper diagnosis, okay?

42:57.993 --> 42:58.982
You don't just -- just,
you know,

42:59.202 --> 43:00.191
do a couple Google searches,

43:00.412 --> 43:02.027
kick back some anti-depressants,

43:02.247 --> 43:03.236
and hope for the best.

43:03.457 --> 43:04.367
You actually have to know

43:04.583 --> 43:05.538
the person's medical history,

43:05.751 --> 43:07.287
their family history,

43:07.502 --> 43:08.833
-what kind of medication --
-So, you don't support

43:09.046 --> 43:11.037
this kind
of psychiatric vigilantism?

43:11.256 --> 43:12.917
No, I don't.
I understand it,

43:13.133 --> 43:14.464
and I sympathize with it.

43:14.676 --> 43:15.711
But, no, I don't support it.

43:15.927 --> 43:16.882
I think it's dangerous

43:17.095 --> 43:18.676
and short-sighted and reckless.

43:18.889 --> 43:21.505
As reckless as breaking in
to Greg Collette's home?

43:22.267 --> 43:24.303
You know, I have a colleague
who specializes

43:24.519 --> 43:25.804
in aggressive
behavior disorders,

43:26.021 --> 43:27.010
and I can give you his number.

43:28.023 --> 43:30.389
Doctor, you know
where Greg lives.

43:32.611 --> 43:34.272
Come on, Sheriff,
you seem like a smart man.

43:34.488 --> 43:36.649
I mean, really, do I strike you
as the sort of person

43:36.865 --> 43:38.776
who is gonna
throw her medical license away

43:38.992 --> 43:40.948
and bust into a patient's house
guns blazing?

43:41.161 --> 43:42.492
-I mean...
-Well, I've seen things

43:42.704 --> 43:45.036
on this job surprise me more.

43:45.248 --> 43:46.863
You put someone
in a bad enough corner,

43:47.084 --> 43:49.166
they'll do just about anything
to get out of it.

43:49.377 --> 43:50.457
[knock on door]

43:51.880 --> 43:53.165
You're gonna want to hear this.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.087
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

44:00.055 --> 44:01.511
So, guess who showed up

44:01.723 --> 44:03.259
at Lee McKinnon's house
after he was released.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.090
Sergeant Marc Van Zandt.

44:05.310 --> 44:07.642
He was driving a blue pickup
truck with Colorado plates.

44:07.854 --> 44:10.596
That Zachary identified.

44:11.817 --> 44:13.227
McKinnon let the sergeant in

44:13.443 --> 44:15.024
before he even had
a chance to knock.

44:15.237 --> 44:16.898
He was inside
for just under five minutes,

44:17.114 --> 44:18.775
and then Van Zandt left.

44:18.990 --> 44:22.903
So, obviously, Lee McKinnon
isn't just a victim in this.

44:23.120 --> 44:24.280
It's starting to look like

44:24.496 --> 44:25.827
Lee McKinnon
and Sergeant Van Zandt

44:25.997 --> 44:27.498
were in on this heist together.

44:48.228 --> 44:49.843
Is everything okay?

44:50.063 --> 44:54.602
Why would Lee McKinnon
and Sergeant Van Zandt

44:54.818 --> 44:56.524
break into Greg Collette's house

44:56.736 --> 44:58.692
and steal
Brandi's engagement ring

44:58.905 --> 45:00.520
if Greg's a friend?

45:03.243 --> 45:05.279
-[sighs]
-[footsteps approach]

45:06.496 --> 45:10.956
Seems that the only thing that's
clear right now is the why.

45:11.168 --> 45:13.784
Whoever did this did it to help.

45:14.004 --> 45:15.835
Which brings up another why.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.833
Why do we got to break our backs
to solve this thing

45:18.049 --> 45:19.255
when all the person
was trying to do

45:19.467 --> 45:21.549
is get medicine to people
who needed it?

45:21.761 --> 45:23.012
It's not like anyone was killed.

45:25.098 --> 45:27.760
-Not this time.
-What do you mean?

45:27.976 --> 45:29.841
We've confiscated
all their pills.

45:31.438 --> 45:34.054
What's gonna happen when they
hit again?

45:34.274 --> 45:35.889
Because they will.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.424
What's going on?

46:05.013 --> 46:06.344
My damn engine crapped out.

46:06.556 --> 46:08.217
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

46:08.433 --> 46:09.934
Well, you can start by doing
exactly what I say

46:10.143 --> 46:11.644
when I say it.

46:11.853 --> 46:13.354
Or you can take your chances
with that grenade.

46:13.563 --> 46:15.349
Shit, man!
Is that thing for real?

46:15.565 --> 46:17.101
You tell me.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.273
-Hands on the wheel!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

46:19.486 --> 46:20.976
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

46:28.036 --> 46:29.992
Keep your eyes forward!
Don't look at my face!

46:30.205 --> 46:31.411
You're gonna drive us
about a quarter mile

46:31.623 --> 46:32.783
down this road, you understand?

46:32.999 --> 46:34.910
-Yeah, yeah, okay.
-Let's go!

46:47.847 --> 46:49.132
We need to hurry this up.

46:50.183 --> 46:52.174
Take a few more cases,
and that's it, all right?

46:52.894 --> 46:54.475
[Walt]
Stop right there.

46:54.688 --> 46:56.224
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.140
Get them up.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.225
Off the truck.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.486
Back up.

47:06.408 --> 47:08.273
Move to the van.

47:08.493 --> 47:09.778
Move it!

47:12.122 --> 47:13.237
Tu rn away.

47:14.291 --> 47:16.247
Keep them up.

47:16.918 --> 47:18.078
Keep them up.

47:28.138 --> 47:30.629
Wrist in that hook.

47:30.849 --> 47:32.510
One each.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.095
On the hook.

47:36.146 --> 47:37.352
Do it!

47:38.732 --> 47:40.643
I figured you guys
would still want these pills.

47:41.359 --> 47:42.940
You wouldn't hit
the warehouse again,

47:43.153 --> 47:44.893
so I've been riding
every Zoloft shipment

47:45.113 --> 47:46.444
the last couple of days.

47:46.656 --> 47:47.862
You need to know, Sheriff,

47:48.074 --> 47:49.575
we never meant for anyone
to get hurt.

47:49.784 --> 47:53.242
Is that right?
Tell that to Greg Collette.

48:01.296 --> 48:02.536
Greg?

48:04.257 --> 48:06.873
I thought you were Lee McKinnon.

48:07.093 --> 48:08.958
I'm sorry, Sheriff. I --

48:09.179 --> 48:11.090
Lee McKinnon didn't have
anything to do with this.

48:12.432 --> 48:14.639
Why'd you go to McKinnon's house
after he got released?

48:14.851 --> 48:17.558
We went to his house to make
sure we had our stories straight

48:17.771 --> 48:19.307
and to thank him
for not turning us in.

48:19.522 --> 48:21.353
Lee was supposed to be on break
at that hour.

48:21.566 --> 48:23.272
When he came up on us,
I panicked,

48:23.485 --> 48:26.352
then I fired,
then he fired back.

48:27.655 --> 48:29.782
That's why you got shot
with Lee McKinnon's gun.

48:29.991 --> 48:31.231
Yes, sir.

48:31.451 --> 48:33.112
[Marc]
After Greg left the warehouse,

48:33.328 --> 48:35.944
I cleaned up all his blood,
I took care of McKinnon's leg.

48:36.164 --> 48:37.950
Gave me an opportunity
to talk to him,

48:38.166 --> 48:40.031
explain why we
were after those pills.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.627
He agreed not to talk.

48:48.176 --> 48:50.087
So, the home invasion

48:50.303 --> 48:53.170
was just a cover-up
for your gunshot wound.

48:53.890 --> 48:56.506
No drugged-up robber.
No fight for a gun.

48:57.894 --> 48:59.634
No stolen engagement ring.

49:00.313 --> 49:01.849
I just thought
that if I could make sure

49:02.065 --> 49:04.556
that the other soldiers got
what Brandi didn't,

49:04.776 --> 49:08.189
if they got the help
that she didn't,

49:08.405 --> 49:10.817
I'd have something to live for.

49:18.998 --> 49:20.738
Right.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.915
So, it was just you two
at the warehouse robbery, right?

49:23.670 --> 49:25.285
Yes, sir. That's right.
It was just us.

49:25.505 --> 49:26.790
Except it wasn't.

49:27.006 --> 49:29.258
Greg just got shot.

49:29.467 --> 49:32.379
I don't think you drove yourself
home from the warehouse

49:32.595 --> 49:34.756
and staged that break-in
by yourself.

49:34.973 --> 49:36.133
Marc didn't drive you.

49:36.307 --> 49:37.888
He was busy sewing up Lee.

49:38.101 --> 49:40.057
-So who helped you?
-I did.

49:40.270 --> 49:42.727
Put your gun down
and let these men go.

49:42.939 --> 49:45.430
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will.

49:46.776 --> 49:50.234
I can set down my gun down.
I can't let these men go.

49:50.447 --> 49:52.563
Look, just take his gun
andleave.

49:52.782 --> 49:54.318
We agreed nobody else gets hurt.

49:54.534 --> 49:57.651
I'm not leaving you behind.
Put your gun down.

49:57.871 --> 49:59.111
Put it down!

50:05.420 --> 50:07.160
And the other one.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.336
Put it down.

50:16.222 --> 50:17.723
Then move over there.

50:18.516 --> 50:19.505
Move!

50:20.518 --> 50:21.724
He hasn't seen your face.

50:21.936 --> 50:24.097
He can't identify you,
so just leave!

50:24.314 --> 50:25.520
Leave now!

50:25.732 --> 50:27.142
Rebecca, what are you doing?

50:27.358 --> 50:29.770
I'm not going anywhere
without those pills.

50:29.986 --> 50:32.102
Gareth won't even talk about
seeing someone at the V.A.,

50:32.322 --> 50:35.689
and I'm terrified he's gonna
end up just like Brandi.

50:35.909 --> 50:37.649
Eli needs a father.

50:37.869 --> 50:39.109
Eli needs his mother, too.

50:39.329 --> 50:43.038
If you shoot me,
my deputies will find you,

50:43.249 --> 50:45.661
arrest you, and put you away
for the rest of your life.

50:45.877 --> 50:47.583
Now, you haven't crossed
that line yet.

50:47.795 --> 50:49.296
You can still have a life
with your husband.

50:49.506 --> 50:51.747
Not without those pills,
I can't!

50:51.966 --> 50:53.672
Turn around
and get on your knees.

50:56.804 --> 50:59.056
Get on your knees.

51:00.183 --> 51:01.468
Now.

51:03.228 --> 51:05.560
Get on your knees.

51:19.369 --> 51:21.109
When I lost my wife...

51:23.915 --> 51:26.497
...I just about gave up
on everything.

51:29.462 --> 51:32.420
You can see how losing Brandi
has affected Greg.

51:33.258 --> 51:36.000
Do you think Gareth will be able
to make it without you?

51:36.219 --> 51:38.130
Shut up!

51:49.649 --> 51:51.765
Did you ever read
"Of Mice and Men"?

51:54.487 --> 51:56.352
There's a scene
at the end of the book.

51:58.408 --> 52:01.821
A man named George shoots
and kills his best friend.

52:02.036 --> 52:03.537
It's beautiful.

52:05.498 --> 52:09.867
George kills Lennie
to save him from being lynched.

52:11.337 --> 52:14.829
When I read the book,
I didn't realize

52:15.049 --> 52:17.791
how any act can become
an act of love.

52:18.011 --> 52:20.002
-[gun cocks]
-Rebecca, no!

52:24.934 --> 52:29.394
You think if Gareth could see
your act of love right now...

52:29.606 --> 52:31.847
he might go get the treatment
he needs?

52:34.736 --> 52:36.852
Maybe he doesn't even need
to see it.

52:37.739 --> 52:39.570
He just needs to hear about it.

52:44.704 --> 52:46.865
If you set your gun down,
Rebecca,

52:47.081 --> 52:50.539
we could call Gareth right now.

52:55.006 --> 52:57.588
It'd mean more if he heard it
from you, I think.

53:09.646 --> 53:10.931
[gun clicks]

53:17.111 --> 53:18.942
[sobbing]

54:02.740 --> 54:04.196
[Walt]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

54:04.409 --> 54:05.398
[clears throat]

54:06.160 --> 54:07.661
It's been a long week.

54:09.706 --> 54:11.367
It's been a long year.

54:12.250 --> 54:15.617
Anyway, um, clearly,

54:15.837 --> 54:18.544
you're the two best candidates
for this job.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.210
I'm not sure either one of you

54:22.427 --> 54:24.292
has demonstrated
what I need to see.

54:27.265 --> 54:28.971
ReaHy?

54:29.183 --> 54:31.435
So, you're not gonna offer
the job to either of us?

54:31.602 --> 54:33.934
[Walt]
No, I'm not.

54:34.147 --> 54:36.012
Maybe I've rushed into
this process too quickly.

54:36.232 --> 54:41.147
Maybe -- Maybe I'm holding you
to unrealistic standards.

54:41.362 --> 54:44.104
Yeah, well, maybe you don't know
what the hell you're doing.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.402
I don't know if you
realize this.

54:47.618 --> 54:50.075
I was doing you a favor
by even applying to this job,

54:50.288 --> 54:52.700
going through
this whole ridiculous process.

54:52.915 --> 54:55.497
It's no wonder your last deputy
ran against you as sheriff.

54:55.710 --> 54:57.826
If I wasn't so afraid
I'd end up dead like him,

54:58.045 --> 55:00.081
I'd do the same damn thing!

55:01.674 --> 55:03.210
It's a joke.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.462
[door slams]

55:10.600 --> 55:13.933
Um... before I leave,

55:14.145 --> 55:17.683
um, can I ask you
what I can improve on?

55:20.902 --> 55:22.893
Well, it's not so much
there's any one thing

55:23.112 --> 55:25.979
you need to work on.

55:26.199 --> 55:30.067
-lt's just...
-|t's the assault, isn't it?

55:30.286 --> 55:33.278
It must have come up in your
background checks. I get it.

55:33.498 --> 55:36.205
Last deputy didn't respond
too well when he got shot.

55:36.417 --> 55:38.794
No. No, he didn't.

55:43.841 --> 55:46.332
You mind talking about
what happened to you...

55:48.971 --> 55:50.427
...four years ago?

55:53.476 --> 55:54.932
Yeah, uh...

55:57.188 --> 55:58.394
Um...

55:59.899 --> 56:02.106
My brother Phil and l

56:02.318 --> 56:05.025
were walking home one night
after a movie

56:05.238 --> 56:08.651
when a dark sedan pulled up.

56:11.118 --> 56:12.449
The next thing I remember,

56:12.662 --> 56:14.698
l was waking up
in a hospital room.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.948
The nurse told me I'd been shot
three times

56:19.168 --> 56:20.874
and that Phil was dead.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.454
I'm sorry.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.632
That must have been hard.

56:28.845 --> 56:33.714
Yeah, I went through
every stage.

56:35.059 --> 56:39.598
Anger, guilt, denial,
back to anger again.

56:40.481 --> 56:43.063
But then, uh, I ran into

56:43.276 --> 56:44.891
one of my brother's
work buddies,

56:45.069 --> 56:49.312
and he introduced me to tai chi.

56:50.783 --> 56:52.774
And it saved me.

56:52.994 --> 56:54.734
How so?

56:56.455 --> 56:58.286
I like to put it like this.

56:59.500 --> 57:02.162
I went to church a lot as a kid.

57:02.378 --> 57:05.620
And we were always taught
to love our enemies.

57:06.632 --> 57:09.749
Tai chi taught me
something new --

57:09.969 --> 57:13.461
to love the enemy inside me,
as well.

57:15.349 --> 57:17.385
So I don't look at peace

57:17.602 --> 57:19.684
as the absence of conflict
anymore.

57:20.605 --> 57:23.893
I see it as the acceptance
of conflict.

57:30.489 --> 57:32.901
I finally finished your book.

57:33.117 --> 57:34.323
Um...

57:35.995 --> 57:37.656
Glad I did.

57:44.795 --> 57:47.002
[Walt]
So, what would you have done

57:47.214 --> 57:49.876
to keep George
from shooting Lennie?

57:51.135 --> 57:52.671
I think George shot Lennie

57:52.887 --> 57:54.969
'cause he felt it was
the only option he had left.

57:56.057 --> 57:58.764
I'd like to get there
before things ever got that bad.

58:26.545 --> 58:28.285
[door slams]

58:30.883 --> 58:31.963
How about Monday?

58:32.176 --> 58:33.757
For what?

58:33.970 --> 58:35.551
First day on the job.

58:36.389 --> 58:39.096
Yeah, Monday works for me.

58:44.313 --> 58:49.228
So, was that the last test
in there?

58:49.443 --> 58:51.934
To see which one of us
could handle adversity?

58:53.155 --> 58:54.315
Maybe.

58:57.493 --> 58:58.903
Thanks, Sheriff.

59:09.213 --> 59:16.130
