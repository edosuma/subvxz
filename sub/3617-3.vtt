- PAIGE: In the attic.

13:07.292 --> 13:11.899
Okay, so the good news is,
it's not a Darklighter...

That's what I've
been telling her.

I don't know anything!

13:19.999 --> 13:22.899
Paige, what are you doing?

13:22.999 --> 13:25.401
Relax, Piper.
I summoned him into a trap

13:25.501 --> 13:28.567
so he could tell me which
of his lovely friends is
trying to kill Melissa.

13:28.667 --> 13:30.150
I'm sorry, did you say relax?

13:30.250 --> 13:34.192
You brought a Darklighter
into our home, and you
want me to relax?

PAIGE: Don't worry, the
Book of Shadows is safe,
downstairs.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.025
I'm not worried
about the Book.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.983
Paige, you have
Whitelighter genes,

13:40.083 --> 13:43.942
which means this guy could
kill you, not to mention my
husband and my unborn child!

13:44.042 --> 13:46.751

in a power position or anything.

Noted. Now, what the hell
is going on with your powers,

14:17.542 --> 14:19.899
I don't know.
I think my half-Whitelighter
baby

14:19.999 --> 14:22.899
thought that fireworks would
be prettier than demon guts.

14:22.999 --> 14:24.942
Okay, you need to teach
your also half-witch baby

14:25.042 --> 14:27.275
the joys of maiming
and killing demons.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.792
Get that thing away from me.

What, are you gonna
tell on me now?

14:33.083 --> 14:34.859
No. We need help.

14:34.959 --> 14:37.983
Especially if my baby's gonna
be messing with my powers.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.818
Look, Melissa's husband's
lungs were incinerated

14:40.918 --> 14:42.401
before the apartment burned.

14:42.501 --> 14:43.899
Leo!

14:43.999 --> 14:46.401
And Darryl said three other men
died the same way recently.

14:46.501 --> 14:48.899
So the fact that Melissa is
a future Whitelighter

14:48.999 --> 14:51.526
might be just a coincidence.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.025

it comes to love.

- Phoebe, this siren is
dangerous.

It's close. I think it
might be Melissa.

- Is the Siren after her?
- No.

than scared.

mean I know what to do.

- Guys?
- BOTH: What?

39:21.626 --> 39:22.751
Oh.

39:24.042 --> 39:25.999
I just thought you might
wanna take cover.

39:27.250 --> 39:32.401
- Hey, I'm not nauseous.
- Hey, I am.

39:32.501 --> 39:34.526
Wait, that's not good news.

39:34.626 --> 39:36.751
What about your powers?

39:42.584 --> 39:44.692
Very nice.

39:44.792 --> 39:46.567
No more floral arrangements.

39:46.667 --> 39:50.899
Yeah, I guess I got in touch
with my inner Whitelighter.

39:50.999 --> 39:52.899
Yeah, helping Melissa
helped me too.

39:52.999 --> 39:55.542
It's good to know
I have it in me.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.792
What?

40:06.709 --> 40:09.899
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]

40:09.999 --> 40:11.317
Oh.

40:11.417 --> 40:13.999
[SPEAKING IN FRENCH]

40:19.751 --> 40:21.876
[KNOCKING]

40:23.999 --> 40:27.275
Hey, look who's
back to using doors.

40:27.375 --> 40:31.900
Yeah, I'm trying to limit
my use of powers.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.999
Probably a wise decision.

40:37.667 --> 40:41.567
So, uh, did you
get my flowers?

40:41.667 --> 40:43.234
Yep.

40:43.334 --> 40:45.067
"Sorry I tried to strangle you"?

40:45.167 --> 40:49.542
Probably not a card
that the florist gets to
write every day, huh?

40:52.876 --> 40:54.834
- I didn't--
- I know.

40:55.959 --> 40:57.983
I know you're sorry.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.983
I know you were under
the Siren's spell.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.442
You do know her magic
feeds on love?

41:02.542 --> 41:04.234
Cole...

41:04.334 --> 41:06.899
She couldn't have lured us
if we didn't love each other.

41:06.999 --> 41:10.899
Right. So once again
our love was nearly fatal.

41:10.999 --> 41:13.109
I never would've hurt you
if I wasn't under her spell.

41:13.209 --> 41:17.859
Most men don't try to kill their
wives when they're under the
Siren's spell.

41:17.959 --> 41:20.150
Most men just kiss and die.

41:20.250 --> 41:22.234
- But because you're a demon--
- I'm not--

41:22.334 --> 41:25.526
Okay, well, because you
have demonic powers,
and a lot of them,

41:25.626 --> 41:28.083
you became a bigger threat
than the Siren.

41:29.542 --> 41:32.317
And that's only one way
out of a thousand

41:32.417 --> 41:34.334
that your powers can
turn against me.

41:40.709 --> 41:43.083
I guess I didn't
want you to be right.

41:47.751 --> 41:49.417
Neither did I.
