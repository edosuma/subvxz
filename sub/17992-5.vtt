00:06.973 --> 00:08.341
{\an8}You're so charming.

00:08.408 --> 00:09.576
{\an8}You make it hard for a guy.

{\an8}There's nothing between us.

{\an8}I didn't raise you to be naive.

00:14.381 --> 00:16.950
{\an8}If she did [bleep] his [bleep],
that means they [bleep].

00:17.016 --> 00:19.519
{\an8}Why is she attacking me?

00:19.586 --> 00:20.920
{\an8}Either keep it cute
or keep it on mute.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.021

{\an8}You're saying I'm not?

00:24.491 --> 00:26.359
{\an8}You should never be
talking to that bitch.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.562
{\an8}I wanted to, you know,
invite you to the baby shower.

00:29.629 --> 00:32.631
{\an8}But I gotta tell you, ma,
if you feel some type of way,

00:32.698 --> 00:33.900
{\an8}just hold it in.

00:33.967 --> 00:37.237
{\an8}We can't bring a beautiful
baby into this world

00:37.303 --> 00:39.038

think you're ready.

{\an8}You get to talk

{\an8}Get out, come see me
then, if you want to.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.832
{\an8}You still think right now

01:05.899 --> 01:07.667
{\an8}Yes, that's what he says.

Ever since Mally has
been caught slumming

01:56.416 --> 01:58.885
{\an5}with that insta-ho Masika,
our relationship has been

01:58.952 --> 02:01.521
more off again than on again.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.457
But Mally has promised me
it's over with and done with.

02:04.524 --> 02:08.461
And I'm willing to
rock with that for now.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.363
Okay, baby, I see you
went all out for me.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.998
I have some making up, you know.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.167
Just a little bit.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.502
I'm glad you're here.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.103
I missed you.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.304
I wanted to do something
really sweet for you,

02:18.371 --> 02:19.105
something romantic.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.073
Thank you.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.007
I just wanted to sit
down and talk to you.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.141
And I got
something here for you.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.877
A surprise for you.

02:23.943 --> 02:25.478
I want you to know
I really mean it.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.981
I want you to open this
one because this is how

02:28.047 --> 02:29.516
I've felt when everything
was going on between us

02:29.582 --> 02:32.051
when you weren't there.

02:32.118 --> 02:33.219
There's nothing here.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.187
Exactly.

02:34.254 --> 02:34.988
I felt empty.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.357
Are you trying to trick me?

02:37.423 --> 02:38.625
No, I just want you to
understand that's the

02:38.691 --> 02:40.960
feeling I had.

02:41.027 --> 02:42.195
Well, I'm glad you finally
told me that, because you

02:42.262 --> 02:43.663
never expressed
these things to me.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.199
And too, right here.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.367
Is it empty too?

02:47.433 --> 02:48.601
This is the important present.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.603
This box is really to seal the
deal and let you know I care

02:50.670 --> 02:51.905
about you and how much I love
you and that I want

02:51.971 --> 02:56.676
to move forward.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.645
Keys to your house?

02:58.711 --> 03:00.079
Are you sure you
can handle that?

03:00.146 --> 03:03.316
Yes, give me a kiss.

03:03.383 --> 03:04.851
I'm so surprised, you've
never even talked about

03:04.918 --> 03:05.852
living with me.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.353
So, let's have a toast.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.454
To us moving in together.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.188
Yes.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.623
Slowly but surely.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.559
I'm coming tomorrow.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.594
[laughter]

03:14.661 --> 03:17.063
Moving in together is a big
deal, but if Mal is ready to

03:17.130 --> 03:19.866
take things to the next level,
then he's going to have to

03:19.933 --> 03:21.534
answer some questions for me.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.969
My biggest concern is that
you didn't sleep with her.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.004
No.

03:25.071 --> 03:25.939
But she did
[bleep] your [bleep].

03:26.005 --> 03:27.140
Yeah.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.508
But you didn't do
nothing back to her?

03:28.575 --> 03:29.309
No.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.443
But did you tell
her you love her?

03:30.510 --> 03:31.277
As a person.

03:31.344 --> 03:32.045
As a person?

03:32.111 --> 03:32.812
As a person.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.447
Never, "I love you."

03:34.514 --> 03:35.715
No, I mean, she was flirtatious
and I might have went

03:35.782 --> 03:36.716
along with it.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.217
Maybe I led her on a little bit.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.086
But I'm thinking,
"Hey, what's going on?"

03:40.153 --> 03:42.055
I'm thinking it
shouldn't have gone that far.

03:42.121 --> 03:43.957
You know, I'm
trying to tell you that.

03:44.023 --> 03:45.992
Part of the reason, I was
going through a lot too.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.894
I felt bad about me
and you breaking up.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.862
You did get me in
this situation with her.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.898
This little irrelevant bitch.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.032
You know that.

03:53.099 --> 03:55.602
So now the only way to
make things better, it's real

03:55.668 --> 03:57.837
important to me if you were to
come to me, I would sit my big

03:57.904 --> 04:01.307
ass on my man's lap and
you let her know what it is.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.675
So, just me telling
you is not enough.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.377
Yeah, because I think she's
delusional and the only way to

04:04.444 --> 04:07.013
break her little delusion is for
me to go over there with her

04:07.080 --> 04:10.550
and you to be,
"Look, this is my woman."

04:10.617 --> 04:13.519
You had your temporary fun
[bleep] for two months and

04:13.586 --> 04:14.654
you're out of our relationship.

04:14.721 --> 04:15.655
Period.

04:15.722 --> 04:16.856
That's all I want to know.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.958
Call me crazy, but I
actually believe Mal.

04:19.024 --> 04:22.060
He say he didn't sleep with her
and he say he didn't love her.

04:22.128 --> 04:25.832
As much as I hate to hear
it, we really were on a break.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.166
But it's still [bleep] up that
he got this bitch's

04:27.233 --> 04:29.068
head all twisted.

04:29.135 --> 04:31.104
So, he's going to undo his
little mess and I'm going

04:31.170 --> 04:33.106
to be there to witness it.

04:33.172 --> 04:34.807
It's not something I'm
looking forward to doing.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.075
But will you do it?

04:36.142 --> 04:37.010
But if it's going to make you
feel better and it's going to

04:37.076 --> 04:38.211
make things better
then, yes, I will do it.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.078
Okay.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.179
All the way.

04:40.246 --> 04:41.447
Let's have a toast to
that, you know what I mean.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.149
Cheers to that.

Ray's punk ass

04:55.595 --> 04:59.265

out, how can a girl resist?

Berg and I have had our
differences, but at the end

05:15.214 --> 05:19.819
of the day they don't call him
"The Hit Maker" for nothing.

05:19.886 --> 05:20.553
Hey.

05:25.091 --> 05:26.826
I'm surprised you reached out.

Teairra and I were cool when she
was out there doing her thing,

05:30.129 --> 05:31.297
you know, hustling.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.666
But I went on the radio station,
I said some things that she

05:33.733 --> 05:35.968
wasn't too happy about.

05:36.035 --> 05:39.672
So, I kept my distance even
when she was living with Hazel.

05:39.739 --> 05:43.276
But you know what, now
Teairra and Hazel are not cool.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.078
Me and Hazel, we're
not doing nothing.

05:45.144 --> 05:48.848
And me and Teairra, we could
be getting a little money,

05:48.915 --> 05:49.949
you know.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.118
{\an5}Maybe she just needs at
"The Hit Maker" to come in,

05:52.185 --> 05:54.320
{\an5}give her a record and make
something happen.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.855
{\an5}I believe in her.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.124
You know, I felt like we had a
little history of [bleep]

05:58.191 --> 06:01.594
with the Hot 97 interview.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.696
I felt like you were putting
my business out in the streets.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.632
Nobody knew me
and Ray dated ever.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.101
And Berg went on
the radio station like,

06:08.167 --> 06:10.236
"Yeah, that was his girl"
and this and that.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.305
I'm like, "Shut the [bleep] up."

06:12.371 --> 06:13.606
I was offended.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.708
Well, when I said that, it
wasn't really to offend you.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.377
Granted, I know it
wasn't really tasteful.

06:18.444 --> 06:19.846
Like I should have
really analyzed [bleep].

06:19.912 --> 06:21.581
But [bleep], I'm just like you.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.050
I say [bleep] and I
don't, I don't think about it.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.284
You know what I'm saying?

06:25.351 --> 06:27.487
I get it and I think we
can see eye-to-eye on that.

06:27.553 --> 06:30.423
I want to touch down with you
and I think we can be around.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.693
And I know you're a great
vocalist, you're a great singer,

06:33.760 --> 06:34.961
you know what I'm saying.

06:35.027 --> 06:38.030
I think we can really help each
other out more than anything.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.866
Granted, there is going to be
some people that's not going

06:39.932 --> 06:40.967
to be happy about it.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.268
I agree.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.303
Which is why I was a
little apprehensive.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.838
What's going on
with that though?

06:45.905 --> 06:48.474
Well, you know,
with you and Hazel.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.176
What about me and Hazel?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.778
Well, you know.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.279
You've been there for
the whole thing though.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.481
We fell out recently.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.751
When she hear, "New Ed 2 Fell
E Fell, Teairra Marie,

06:58.818 --> 07:03.723
oh Hit Maker", what's going
to be the situation?

07:03.790 --> 07:04.991
She's probably going to be mad.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.993
I don't care.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.629
We're not friends anymore.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.798
I don't know the status
of Hazel's non-existent

07:11.864 --> 07:13.299
relationship with Berg.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.968
This has nothing to
do with the person.

07:16.035 --> 07:17.770
This is all about business
and whatever Hazel feels

07:17.837 --> 07:19.972
is just what Hazel feels.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.576
I just want to know that if we
start to work and Hazel gets

07:23.643 --> 07:27.146
mad, you're not going to
backtrack and change your mind.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.181
Oh, she's going to be furious.

07:28.247 --> 07:28.948
Really?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.249
Furious.

07:30.316 --> 07:33.352
Y'all's personal business,
listen, I'm going to have to

07:33.419 --> 07:35.188
keep it 100, and please
excuse my French,

07:35.254 --> 07:36.823
I stay out of bitch's business.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.125
Hazel don't impact my breakfast
at 7:30 in the morning,

07:39.192 --> 07:42.361
let alone what I do and
how I get to a check.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.697
She's going to have to sit her
little ass down, focus on what

07:44.764 --> 07:48.801
she has going on and
get off of my bumper.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.270
I think you're
talented, I think you're dope.

07:51.337 --> 07:52.338
Yeah.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.006
So, if I could give you a
couple of great records,

07:54.073 --> 07:55.141
you know what I'm saying.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.709
Like [bleep] all I'm about.

07:56.776 --> 07:57.944
Let me live.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.378
I'm going to cook
up a few things.

07:59.445 --> 08:00.847
I got a couple of
ideas to show you.

08:00.913 --> 08:01.914
Okay.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.216
So I can lay the red
carpet out for you.

08:03.282 --> 08:04.483
Now I'm excited.

I haven't seen Hazel since we
ran into Berg and his little

08:20.900 --> 08:23.369
Oh, love you already.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.138
And of course I have my
own drama with Mally.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.874
So, I asked her over so that
we could commiserate

08:27.940 --> 08:30.810
that all men [bleep] suck.

08:30.877 --> 08:34.347
This thing with me and Berg is
like a nightmare because days

08:34.413 --> 08:38.784
prior to ASCAP we had just had a
talk like we keep coming back

08:38.851 --> 08:42.087
to each other, maybe we
need to explore it.

And what's so
[bleep] up is he agreed.

What Berg did at ASCAP, bringing
the girl and the things he said,

something about Berg.

If I try to walk away from
him, he's going to chase.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.941
Sadly, Hazel's exactly right.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.410
The minute you turn your

09:04.477 --> 09:07.647
he decides to chase you.

From what Mally told me,
she is his ex-girlfriend.

But she's sitting here like
plotting after -- first of all

09:37.443 --> 09:39.612
you're [bleep]

09:39.679 --> 09:41.881
Okay, he is out here in
these streets like a stray.

whole face was just still.

09:44.483 --> 09:45.551
So, what did you do, honey?

09:45.618 --> 09:48.220
I politely dusted her face.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.255
What do you mean
dusted her face?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.856
Did you connect?

09:50.923 --> 09:52.058
I was just rubbing her chin.

09:52.124 --> 09:53.559
Oh.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.162
She's lucky a
dusting was all she got.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.531
What I should have
did was whip her ass.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.433
I really could have used Hazel
there for backup because

10:00.499 --> 10:03.669
her ex-roommate was
there as a spectator.

10:03.736 --> 10:07.006
So, I set back down and that's
when I realized Teairra

10:07.073 --> 10:08.774
is still sitting.

10:08.841 --> 10:09.942
Like that's my problem with
Teairra, you want to come to

10:10.009 --> 10:11.777
the party and you want to go
ahead and watch the show.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.880
Or, you want to rah
rah sis boom bah.

I thought the turn up was real.

That's Teairra for you.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.856
{\an5}You think she's down for you.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.558
But when she [bleep] pops off,
she likes to sit back,

10:25.624 --> 10:27.259
watch and enjoy the show.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.527
I don't know what I'm going to
do about this whole Mally thing,

10:28.594 --> 10:29.829
to be honest with you.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.864
But what I know is I'm not
about to fight over no man.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.366
It's not going to happen.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.067
I'm not going to argue with no

10:48.080 --> 10:50.082
I'm going to get my
neck breaker back.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.319
That's what I do.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.720

used to look like.

10:54.787 --> 10:55.488

{\an8}You weren't there, right?

10:56.689 --> 10:57.957
{\an8}Okay, Teairra told me.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.325

How do you know I
didn't say something?

16:12.338 --> 16:15.808
Exactly, because you got that
shred of testosterone in you

16:15.874 --> 16:17.476

Apryl's on ten

would like for her to be there,

really want her there because

16:39.064 --> 16:40.566

was a friend to me.

Masika was like, "Oh, I saw that
before picture of you, Nikki."

18:44.723 --> 18:46.658
And I'm like thinking, "Maybe
you know what, maybe she's just

18:46.725 --> 18:48.660
talking [bleep] because she just
has nothing to talk about,

18:48.727 --> 18:49.895
you know."

Teairra confirmed the whole
thing with me, but what's the

18:51.663 --> 18:52.798
point of you doing that?

18:52.865 --> 18:53.665
Because it is true.

18:53.732 --> 18:54.967
You definitely did
get [bleep] done.

18:55.033 --> 18:55.534
I did.

18:55.601 --> 18:56.335
I was just showing it.

18:56.401 --> 18:57.636
That seemed phony
to me, honestly.

18:57.703 --> 18:59.204
I was not talking
[bleep] about you.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.739
What you did to me totally
seemed fake to me,

19:00.806 --> 19:01.874
or some hater [bleep].

19:01.940 --> 19:03.675
I'm not fake and
I have no reason.

That's just what I think.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.779

got more plastic in her body

used to look like.

Okay, cool.

19:12.851 --> 19:13.352
Is that what I did?

19:13.418 --> 19:14.186
I don't know.

19:14.253 --> 19:14.753
Because you
weren't there, right?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.555
Okay, Teairra told me.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.223
I'll have a talk with Teairra to
make sure she says what

24:24.629 --> 24:29.601
I was thinking maybe having
Ray do some co-hosting with me.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.903
Power House is one of the
biggest events that

24:31.970 --> 24:33.205
Power 106 does.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.373
Everyone in LA is trying
to get to Power House.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.642
Well, this is a
really big deal for Yesi.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.444
I was thinking of him just
coming out and doing some fun

24:39.511 --> 24:42.547
stuff with me on stage, but
not take away from my shine.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.716
Make sure you let him know
that before you go up there.

24:44.783 --> 24:45.951
Oh, I'll tell him.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.219
So, that's why I
wanted to talk to you.

24:47.285 --> 24:48.453
That's a good idea.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.155
I'll see what his schedule's
like and figure it out and make

24:50.222 --> 24:51.990
sure I have a pep talk with him.

24:52.057 --> 24:54.793
Um, oh God.

24:54.860 --> 25:00.498
There's just some things that
I need to talk about with him.

25:00.565 --> 25:05.570
Um, our relationship is
like a brother and sister,

25:05.637 --> 25:08.373
but I just feel like he's
not listening to me.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.576
I'm trying to
help him, you know.

25:11.643 --> 25:15.714
I'm trying to help him
so much that I'm a bitch.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.250
And like I'm sick of being
loyal to people who are

25:18.316 --> 25:19.818
not loyal to me.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.653
I know Ray means well.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.622
I know he's got a good heart.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.156
And you've earned the
right to pull him aside

25:25.223 --> 25:27.425
and tell him how I feel.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.094
I don't know.

25:29.160 --> 25:31.796
Have you ever thought about
separating yourself from Ray

25:31.863 --> 25:33.698
and venturing on your own?

25:33.765 --> 25:35.333
Like I went through this whole
transition period and I had

25:35.400 --> 25:37.569
to let go of certain
people in my life.

25:37.636 --> 25:39.204
I'm in that transition now.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.539
Yeah, it's hard.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.241
It's not easy to do.

25:43.308 --> 25:46.811
Because see, with me it's so
hard for me to let go of people

25:46.878 --> 25:49.214
because I never had anybody.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.715
When I was a child I didn't
know what love meant,

25:50.782 --> 25:51.683
I didn't know what it felt like.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.151
I raised myself.

25:53.218 --> 25:57.455
My mom did not give a
[bleep] about me at all.

25:57.522 --> 25:58.623
She just left me.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.191
I went into foster care.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.894
And then she would just leave
me there, she wouldn't visit me,

26:02.961 --> 26:03.995
she didn't love me.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.330
Does she talk to you now?

26:05.397 --> 26:06.765
She's passed away when I was 15.

26:06.831 --> 26:07.899
Oh, she passed.

26:07.966 --> 26:12.170
I never had anything growing up.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.540
I never had any one person
stay in my life consistently.

26:15.607 --> 26:16.641
Now, I see why.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.944
Ray J and my
friendship means so much to me.

26:19.010 --> 26:21.980
And he's the family I
made in the industry.

26:22.047 --> 26:23.848
{\an5}I didn't know nay of
this about Morgan.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.884
{\an5}It just really makes
me respect her more.

26:25.951 --> 26:29.120
To know where she came from and
make this successful life

26:29.187 --> 26:33.224
about herself is just really
amazing and inspiring.

26:33.291 --> 26:34.626
Why is it that whenever
I sit with you I can

26:34.693 --> 26:36.561
completely open up?

26:36.628 --> 26:38.997
But Ray doesn't know
half this stuff about me.

26:39.064 --> 26:42.534
He doesn't know how
much he changed my life.

26:42.600 --> 26:47.706
I've seen you put in a lot of
work with everybody else's life.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.308
At what point are you going to
step out of someone else's

26:50.375 --> 26:53.378
limelight and just really
be your own woman to stand

26:53.445 --> 26:54.679
on your own two feet?

26:54.746 --> 26:56.414
You gotta work at
being whole again.

26:56.481 --> 26:58.450
I got some thinking to do.

26:58.516 --> 27:00.819
So, I want to pay
you for this session.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.654
Oh, my God!

27:02.721 --> 27:04.222
You know what, but I'll take
this fancy bag you got

27:04.289 --> 27:05.657
over here though.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.325
{\an8}All I hear is, "I can't
wait to get to the gym.

27:07.392 --> 27:09.361
{\an8}Ooh, I want my stomach flat."

27:09.427 --> 27:10.895
{\an8}That's not what's important.

27:10.962 --> 27:11.696
{\an8}But you don't even know her.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.498
{\an8}I know her enough, Omari.

27:13.565 --> 27:17.369
{\an8}You like making me look like a
fool and all I'm doing is being

27:17.435 --> 27:19.371
{\an8}down for you and you can't do
the same [bleep] thing for me.

27:19.437 --> 27:20.939
{\an8}You just don't care.

27:21.006 --> 27:22.173
{\an8}I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.977
♪♪

27:33.852 --> 27:34.419
What up?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.187
What up?

27:36.254 --> 27:38.023
{\an5}I don't know
which one's crazier.

27:38.089 --> 27:40.558
{\an5}Teairra for thinking it's okay
to go and work for my man after

27:40.625 --> 27:44.095
me and her got beef, or Berg's
ass for thinking he can go

27:44.162 --> 27:45.930
run and work with Teairra.

27:45.997 --> 27:50.301
It's like ultimate betrayal and
I cannot let this [bleep] slide.

27:50.368 --> 27:51.936
What's going on?

27:52.003 --> 27:55.073
Why is it that I'm hearing
that you holler at Teairra

27:55.140 --> 27:56.674
about doing a record for her?

27:56.741 --> 27:58.309
Why would you do that?

27:58.376 --> 28:00.712
Teairra was requested to come to
my studio because I was trying

28:00.779 --> 28:02.414
to right some of my wrongs.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.615
I'm working hard.

28:03.681 --> 28:04.582
So you're going to right the
wrong with the bitch

28:04.649 --> 28:05.383
that I'm [bleep] with.

28:05.450 --> 28:06.451
She can't get to me.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.253
I don't give a
[bleep] about nothing.

28:08.319 --> 28:09.587
Like all the little
[bleep] she talk.

28:09.654 --> 28:12.290
So, her having a record
from me is getting to you?

28:12.357 --> 28:14.092
Of course.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.560
{\an5}Is this woman crazy?

28:15.627 --> 28:17.729
{\an5}Did she just come up to me
trying to tell me who I can

28:17.796 --> 28:19.998
{\an5}work with or what I'm doing?

28:20.065 --> 28:21.866
Get the [bleep] out of here.

28:21.933 --> 28:24.169
I should be the only bitch
that's new that you working

28:24.235 --> 28:26.237
with because we've been
riding together for so long.

28:26.304 --> 28:28.807
You know that ain't realistic.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.208
You ain't going to be the
only new [bleep] that I'm

28:30.275 --> 28:31.443
working with, for real.

28:31.509 --> 28:32.544
But right now, at the time,
you're going to put your

28:32.610 --> 28:33.978
energy into this bitch.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.747
I gotta sit back and
watch you go work with her.

28:35.814 --> 28:38.483
You worried about
the wrong [bleep].

28:38.550 --> 28:39.717
You worried about Teairra.

28:39.784 --> 28:41.453
You're supposed to be worried
about your [bleep] records.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.454
What's up with that?

28:42.520 --> 28:44.923
I heard that you just
sent them to my team.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.825
So, I guess I'm going to go
ahead and work on the record.

28:46.891 --> 28:48.059
Then you need to have a
conversation with your

28:48.126 --> 28:49.327
[bleep] team then.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.097
You like making me look like a
fool and all I'm doing is being

28:52.163 --> 28:54.732
down for you and you can't
do the [bleep] same for me.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.501
It's too much for me.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.037
You're doing that regardless.

28:59.104 --> 29:01.072
You have no care or
regard for anything.

29:01.139 --> 29:02.674
I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.476
You're talking to me like you're
my manager or like you're

29:04.542 --> 29:05.977
my girlfriend or my wife
or something like that.

29:06.044 --> 29:07.479
I'm defensive.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.314
I'm clearly nothing to you.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.381
You know what, I've
made up my mind, yeah,

29:10.448 --> 29:11.883
that's what I'm going to do.

29:11.950 --> 29:15.453
Obviously Berg don't care
nothing about me and it really

29:15.520 --> 29:17.522
shows a lot about his
character and how he

29:17.589 --> 29:18.990
really feels about me.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.592
I don't like the
[bleep] you're doing.

29:20.658 --> 29:22.494
I don't like how
you're playing me.

29:22.560 --> 29:26.297
I feel like you don't hold me in
the same place that I hold you.

29:26.364 --> 29:29.267
I didn't come here to have this
conversation and make you upset

29:29.334 --> 29:32.604
or whatever, but I just think
you putting too much feelings

29:32.670 --> 29:35.306
into things
that's not necessary.

29:35.373 --> 29:37.175
You're putting too much feelings
into me when we need to

29:37.242 --> 29:39.277
be focusing on the
business and us getting to it.

29:39.344 --> 29:40.945
So, I got some beats.

29:41.012 --> 29:43.715
I got some ideas.

29:43.781 --> 29:44.983
It's on you if you want to
come by the studio and

29:45.049 --> 29:47.752
really get to it.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.888
You know this is what I want
more than anything,

29:49.954 --> 29:51.856
so of course I'm going to
put the music first.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.992
Leave the Teairra
[bleep] at the front door.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.360
You leave it at the front door.

29:55.426 --> 29:56.794
I didn't bring it to the park.

29:56.861 --> 30:00.498
Have your people contact me when
you're ready to do these verses

30:00.565 --> 30:01.900
and I'm going to be on that.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.502
You [bleep].

30:04.569 --> 30:05.904
Okay, I'm out.

♪♪

30:14.879 --> 30:16.014
I'm making another effort.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.282
{\an5}I'm going to try to
talk some sense into moms.

30:17.348 --> 30:21.119
{\an5}I feel like a tennis ball
between my mom and Apryl.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.621
But real talk, I can't have
Apryl stressing, you know,

30:23.688 --> 30:27.192
while she's pregnant, so my
mom is going to have to chill.

30:27.258 --> 30:33.865
Mom, when you tell someone
that you feel like they're not

30:33.932 --> 30:40.672
equipped or ready for
parenthood or being a mother,

30:40.738 --> 30:41.873
that's disrespectful.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.942
I find nothing
disrespectful about that.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.177
I'm just telling
you from what I see.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.112
All I hear is like, "I
can't wait to get to the gym.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.881
Ooh, I want my stomach flat.

Ooh.

I want this, I want that."

30:51.916 --> 30:52.850
What's wrong with that?

30:52.917 --> 30:54.152
It's nothing wrong
with that, Omari.

that's not what's important.

30:55.887 --> 30:57.222
Mom, come on.

30:57.288 --> 30:58.923
First of all, let me
ask you a question.

30:58.990 --> 30:59.991
Hold on.

31:00.058 --> 31:02.560
Did you not change
when you saw my face?

31:02.627 --> 31:03.828
Did things not change for you?

31:03.895 --> 31:04.529
Absolutely.

31:04.596 --> 31:05.663
Exactly.

31:05.730 --> 31:07.565
So, what makes you think that
things won't change when

31:07.632 --> 31:09.100
she sees her child's face?

31:09.167 --> 31:10.435
Because of her personality.

31:10.501 --> 31:11.402
That's what makes me think.

31:11.469 --> 31:12.437
But you don't
know her that well.

31:12.503 --> 31:14.606
I know her enough, Omari.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.074
I'm a woman, I'm a female too.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.742
I know how females roll.

31:17.809 --> 31:21.079
{\an5}Omarion may be fooled
by Apryl, but not me.

31:21.145 --> 31:24.215
{\an5}I know Apryl to be
selfish and materialistic.

31:24.282 --> 31:25.984
Not good qualities for a mother.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.819
She has a lot of
growing up to do.

31:27.885 --> 31:29.587
I'm just saying it how I see it.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.489
The other reason why I wanted to
have this conversation with you

31:31.556 --> 31:35.026
is because we planned
on doing a home birth.

31:35.093 --> 31:37.795
And after we met with the
midwife, she expressed to us

31:37.862 --> 31:41.432
how difficult it is when
a woman is under stress

31:41.499 --> 31:43.167
and how the baby doesn't come.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.103
So, you won't be at the birth.

31:45.169 --> 31:46.871
Oh, I won't.

31:46.938 --> 31:47.705
No, you won't.

31:47.772 --> 31:49.073
I need to be there.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.708
He need to feel my energy
just as much as his mother,

31:50.775 --> 31:52.677
just as much as yours.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.112
How close are you
with your grandmother?

31:54.178 --> 31:55.413
Very close.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.748
She's very
important in your life.

31:56.814 --> 32:00.051
And not only that, Omari, did
you even stop to think how

32:00.118 --> 32:02.520
you was brought into this world?

32:02.587 --> 32:05.156
You was born at
home by your Nana.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.091
I can't even be there.

32:07.158 --> 32:08.993
It's like a tradition
that you're breaking up.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.929
It is really [bleep] up because
you know that this is

32:11.996 --> 32:13.564
not how we roll.

32:13.631 --> 32:15.366
You know that's not how I roll.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.102
I don't like to see my
mom upset like this.

32:18.169 --> 32:22.940
But the truth is Apryl and my
unborn son is my family now.

32:23.007 --> 32:25.476
My mom needs to respect that,
understand that and

32:25.543 --> 32:27.211
take it back some.

32:27.278 --> 32:32.417
What I need you to do to make
this process go clearly for me,

32:32.483 --> 32:33.384
my son coming to the world.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.519
Always about you.

32:34.585 --> 32:36.287
No, this is actually not
