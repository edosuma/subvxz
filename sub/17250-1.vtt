02:47.701 --> 02:48.895
Warren?

02:50.061 --> 02:52.017
You'll wake yourself up.

02:52.101 --> 02:54.012
I'll get you breakfast.

02:55.101 --> 02:57.137
No time. The meeting starts at 10:00.

02:57.221 --> 03:00.295
Don't worry about it.
They always have coffee there.

03:00.383 --> 03:02.135
You're gonna fly down?

03:02.503 --> 03:06.132
I'll check out one of the trainers.
That way I can get back when I want.

03:14.583 --> 03:16.574
What are you up to today

03:17.143 --> 03:20.455
Shopping. I'll get clothes for the boys.

03:21.105 --> 03:22.777
They grow so fast.

03:25.985 --> 03:28.374
Need any money? I cashed a cheque.

03:41.026 --> 03:42.301
I had the dream again.

03:46.067 --> 03:49.742
Always ends at the same place.
I guess that's just as well.

03:50.907 --> 03:54.582
Sometime I'm going to see that matador,
find out who he is.

03:55.787 --> 03:58.096
When I do, that's it, that's the end of me.

03:58.187 --> 04:01.021
Don't talk like that now, it's only a dream.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.784
- Maybe I ought to resign.
- What good would that do?

04:08.108 --> 04:12.340
It would make the dream go away.
I'm sure of that. They're connected.

04:12.748 --> 04:16.661
Katie, the dream and what I'm doing.

04:18.548 --> 04:20.620
Sometimes I feel
the only way I can make it disappear

04:20.709 --> 04:22.985
is to give it all up, to resign.

04:23.390 --> 04:26.906
But you can't resign.
You can't give up your whole life.

04:28.591 --> 04:30.309
You're my life, too.

04:31.431 --> 04:33.069
You and the boys.

04:38.350 --> 04:40.261
Maybe I have to choose.

04:41.351 --> 04:43.228
Or maybe it's too late.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.866
Oh, Warren, don't go. Skip the meeting.

04:46.192 --> 04:48.309
Tell them my wife insists
I go shopping with her?

04:48.393 --> 04:50.190
I'll skip the shopping.

04:50.273 --> 04:52.833
We could have lunch together.
We haven't done that in months.

04:52.913 --> 04:54.869
A little French restaurant with wine.

04:54.953 --> 04:57.672
This one's special.
The new Secretary's going to be there.

04:57.753 --> 05:00.551
They're even holding it in the war room
to show how up-to-date we are.

05:02.434 --> 05:04.345
You could do with a day off.

05:04.634 --> 05:07.432
In the middle of the week? That's immoral.

05:10.114 --> 05:12.389
We can go out for dinner.
I'll be back by then.

05:12.474 --> 05:14.305
If I can get a sitter.

05:14.994 --> 05:17.428
You got me, you can get anything.

05:34.397 --> 05:37.035
I don't know what I'd do without you.

05:37.436 --> 05:39.472
You wouldn't do very well.

05:40.556 --> 05:42.991
There's no chance of that, is there?

05:45.437 --> 05:46.836
None at all.

06:28.841 --> 06:32.802
Two hours ago you said 100 million dead.
Now you say 60 million.

06:33.163 --> 06:37.873
I say 60 million is perhaps the highest price
we should be prepared to pay in a war.

06:38.362 --> 06:41.559
And what's the difference between
60 million dead and 100 million?

06:41.762 --> 06:44.197
- 40 million.
- Some difference.

06:44.443 --> 06:47.640
Are you prepared to say the saving
of 40 million lives is of no importance?

06:48.043 --> 06:49.601
You miss the point, Professor.

06:49.683 --> 06:52.595
The saving of those 60 million lives
is what's important.

06:53.003 --> 06:55.837
Face facts, Mr Foster.
We're talking about war.

06:55.924 --> 06:58.597
I say every war,
including thermonuclear war,

06:58.684 --> 07:00.879
must have a winner and a loser.
Which would you rather be?

07:00.964 --> 07:05.642
In a nuclear war, everyone loses.
War isn't what it used to be.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.281
It's still the resolution
of economic and political conflict.

07:08.366 --> 07:11.357
Well, what kind of resolution
with 100 million dead?

07:11.445 --> 07:14.084
- It doesn't have to be 100 million.
- Even 60!

07:14.165 --> 07:16.760
The same as 1,000 years ago, sir,

07:16.846 --> 07:19.599
when you also had wars
that wiped out whole peoples.

07:19.686 --> 07:23.759
The point is still who wins and who loses,
the survival of a culture.

07:23.846 --> 07:27.044
A culture? With most of its people dead,

07:27.127 --> 07:31.279
the rest dying, the food poisoned,
the air unfit to breathe?

07:31.367 --> 07:34.165
- You call that a culture?
- Yes, I do, Mr Foster.

07:34.247 --> 07:37.126
I am not a poet. I'm a political scientist

07:37.328 --> 07:41.401
who would rather have an American culture
survive than a Russian one.

07:41.488 --> 07:45.926
But what would it be like?
I mean, really like? Who would survive?

07:47.049 --> 07:48.721
Who would survive?

07:54.009 --> 07:56.204
It's an interesting question.

07:57.850 --> 07:59.363
I would predict

08:00.690 --> 08:02.999
convicts and file clerks.

08:05.851 --> 08:09.685
And the worst convicts,
those deep down in solitary confinement,

08:10.171 --> 08:14.687
and the most ordinary file clerks,
probably for large insurance companies.

08:15.211 --> 08:17.805
Because they would be
in fireproofed rooms,

08:17.891 --> 08:21.646
protected by tons of the best insulator
in the world, paper.

08:22.892 --> 08:24.723
Then imagine what will happen.

08:24.812 --> 08:28.362
The small group of vicious criminals
will fight the army of file clerks

08:28.453 --> 08:30.762
for the remaining means of life.

08:31.053 --> 08:33.408
The convicts will know violence

08:33.933 --> 08:36.765
but the file clerks will know organization.

08:37.732 --> 08:39.769
Who do you think will win?

08:43.653 --> 08:47.409
It's all hypothesis, of course,
but fun to play around with.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.687
And, time to go home.
I didn't mean to hold forth so long.

08:51.775 --> 08:54.573
I don't usually come to a supper party
and talk right through to breakfast.

08:54.655 --> 08:56.373
Nonsense, Professor. We were fascinated.

08:56.455 --> 08:58.093
I just hope we didn't keep you
from your work.

08:58.175 --> 09:00.325
Not at all.
I've got a 10:00 meeting at the Pentagon.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.690
Plenty of time to get home and change.

09:01.776 --> 09:03.687
You must come again,
Professor Groeteschele,

09:03.776 --> 09:04.891
with your wife this time.

09:04.976 --> 09:06.614
I'd be delighted.

09:08.137 --> 09:09.206
- Good night.
- All right. Thanks.

09:09.297 --> 09:10.286
Thanks again, ma'am.

09:22.297 --> 09:25.449
I'm Ilsa Wolfe.
We were introduced before dinner.

09:26.298 --> 09:28.494
I'd like you to take me home.

09:38.379 --> 09:40.813
You'll have to give me directions.

09:41.019 --> 09:42.929
Just stay on this road.

09:59.621 --> 10:02.419
You could joke about the convicts
and file clerks

10:02.501 --> 10:06.177
because you know there won't be
any survivors, will there?

10:06.302 --> 10:07.576
Not many.

10:08.663 --> 10:10.654
None. None at all.

10:12.423 --> 10:14.378
That's the beauty of it.

10:16.942 --> 10:21.458
I've heard nuclear war called a lot of things,
Miss Wolfe, never beautiful.

10:21.542 --> 10:25.137
People are afraid to call it that,
but that's what they feel.

10:25.222 --> 10:28.021
- The beauty of death?
- Don't patronize me.

10:28.583 --> 10:31.622
What else but that are you selling,
Professor?

10:33.625 --> 10:38.016
We all know we're going to die,
but you make a game out of it,

10:38.105 --> 10:41.142
a marvelous game
that includes the whole world.

10:42.825 --> 10:47.056
- You make it seem possible.
- It is possible, even probable.

10:47.584 --> 10:49.941
You make death an entertainment,

10:50.906 --> 10:53.545
something that can be played
in a living room.

10:53.626 --> 10:55.537
As good a place as any.

10:58.466 --> 11:01.344
No. No, there's an even better place.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.021
Turn in there.

11:23.388 --> 11:25.140
This where you live?

11:25.668 --> 11:29.502
- Don't joke.
- Why not? I'm the joker.

11:30.308 --> 11:33.746
I make death into a game
for people like you to get excited about.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.661
I watched you tonight.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.821
You'd love making it possible,
wouldn't you?

11:37.911 --> 11:40.220
You'd love pressing that button.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.546
What a thrill that would be.

11:42.711 --> 11:44.542
Knowing you have to die,

11:44.631 --> 11:47.861
to have the power
to take everyone else with you,

11:47.950 --> 11:51.421
the mob of them with their plans,
their little hopes,

11:51.871 --> 11:54.830
born to be murdered
and turning away from it,

11:54.912 --> 11:56.903
closing their eyes to it.

11:57.312 --> 12:00.622
And you could be the one to make it true,
do it to them.

12:01.792 --> 12:06.024
But you're afraid,
so you look for the thrill someplace else.

12:06.912 --> 12:09.506
And who better than a man who isn't afraid?

12:29.194 --> 12:31.628
I'm not your kind.

12:49.596 --> 12:51.109
- Airman?
- Sir?

12:51.636 --> 12:54.709
General Bogan should be on his way in.
Tell him I checked out the new computer.

12:54.797 --> 12:57.392
I'll be back on duty before he leaves
to check it out again with him.

12:57.478 --> 13:00.038
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be in my quarters if he wants me.

13:00.118 --> 13:01.836
- Yes, sir. Oh, sir?
- Yes?

13:01.918 --> 13:03.431
There's a telephone message for you.

13:03.558 --> 13:06.868
They want you to call right back,
said it was urgent.

13:15.719 --> 13:17.152
Line, please.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.749
Hello.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.476
Yes, I got the message.
Why do you think I'm calling?

13:36.841 --> 13:38.911
Well, where did he get the money?

13:41.402 --> 13:43.518
No, no, no, I'll come myself.

13:51.921 --> 13:55.040
I'm going into town, Airman.
That's the address.

13:55.283 --> 13:57.877
I'll be there about a half an hour,
then I'm coming back to the base.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.157
Yes, sir.

14:00.564 --> 14:02.714
Better button up
before the general gets here.

14:02.804 --> 14:04.078
Yes, sir.

14:05.724 --> 14:08.158
General Bogars office. Airman Slote.

14:08.244 --> 14:09.597
No, sir, General. He's just left.

14:10.044 --> 14:13.036
Damn it, I need him.
Where did he sign out to?

14:18.925 --> 14:21.233
Conklin, you know where that is?

14:23.165 --> 14:25.076
Yes, sir. It's on the way to the base.

14:25.165 --> 14:29.000
Well, get on over there.
I'll pick him up myself, Airman. Thank you.

14:33.646 --> 14:35.797
- This is the house, General.
- You sure this is it?

14:35.887 --> 14:37.878
You sure there's not another street
by this name?

14:37.967 --> 14:41.676
Oh, no, sir. I've lived in Omaha all my life.
I know this city like the back of my hand.

14:41.767 --> 14:43.724
No, don't bother getting out.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.365
- Spending the money I send you on this!
- Give me that!

15:13.450 --> 15:15.805
You raise your hand
against my mother once more...

15:15.890 --> 15:18.280
Just a drop! Who the hell are you?

15:20.331 --> 15:22.480
- Yeah?
- I'm General Bogan.

15:22.570 --> 15:25.164
I'm looking for Colonel Cascio.
He gave this address.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.765
- Oh, sure, now, General.
- Let the gentleman in, Luke.

15:27.851 --> 15:31.287
Honoured to have you.
My son always speaks well of you.

15:32.811 --> 15:34.403
Sorry to bother you, Colonel.

15:34.491 --> 15:37.803
We have some unexpected VIPs
we have to show around.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.883
Yes, sir. I'll be right along.

15:42.973 --> 15:45.248
Why don't you come in, General?

15:46.053 --> 15:47.533
Thank you, I...

15:49.694 --> 15:52.605
I just take a drop now and then.

15:53.733 --> 15:56.372
The boy here, he gets a little excited.

15:56.653 --> 15:58.167
I'm ready, sir.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.723
Damn snot-nosed kid.

16:27.776 --> 16:31.656
It's that Congressman Raskob, the one
who's been nosing around the bases.

16:31.737 --> 16:33.773
Washington wants us
to put his mind at ease.

16:33.857 --> 16:36.655
- He's on one of those committees.
- Yes, sir.

16:38.338 --> 16:43.048
Gordon Knapp will also be there to look
over that equipment his company makes.

16:43.178 --> 16:44.851
He'll be on our side.

16:44.939 --> 16:47.533
Anyone looks cross-eyed at his stuff,
he goes up like a rocket.

16:47.619 --> 16:48.893
Yes, sir.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.770
Time was when I'd say
"he goes up like a balloon."

16:57.579 --> 16:59.536
- Times change.
- Yes, sir.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.809
Ploesti, that was the rough one.

17:09.940 --> 17:11.737
We lost half our group.

17:11.819 --> 17:14.335
Regensburg was the worst one for us.

17:14.621 --> 17:18.090
I never flew the B-17, only 24s.

17:19.983 --> 17:21.575
Good aeroplane, the 24.

17:21.663 --> 17:23.381
At least you knew
you were flying the aeroplane,

17:23.463 --> 17:25.737
not the other way around,
like today's things.

17:25.821 --> 17:28.176
You still have to fly the Vindicator, Grady.

17:28.262 --> 17:30.730
We're the last of the lot, Flynn.
Don't kid yourself about that.

17:30.822 --> 17:34.736
- The next aeroplanes, they won't need men.
- You'll be too old, anyway.

17:34.823 --> 17:38.133
After us, the machines.
We're halfway there already.

17:39.463 --> 17:41.136
Look at those kids.

17:42.664 --> 17:45.258
Remember the crews you had on the 24s?

17:45.344 --> 17:49.542
Jews, Italians, all kinds.
You could tell them apart. They were people.

17:49.624 --> 17:53.538
These kids, you open them up,
you'll find they run on transistors.

17:53.625 --> 17:56.093
- No, they're good kids, I tell you.
- Sure, sure.

17:56.185 --> 17:59.621
You know they're good at their jobs,
but you don't know them. How can you?

17:59.705 --> 18:02.266
We get a different crew
every time we go up.

18:02.346 --> 18:04.143
That's policy, Grady.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.134
It eliminates the personal factor.

18:07.226 --> 18:11.219
Everything is more complicated now.
Reaction time is faster.

18:11.866 --> 18:14.744
You can't depend on people the same way.

18:15.466 --> 18:16.785
Who do you depend on?

18:17.910 --> 18:20.488
All right, gentlemen. The sky awaits.

18:24.215 --> 18:25.597
You know something, Billy?

18:26.998 --> 18:29.224
I like the personal factor.

18:59.385 --> 19:03.037
Those are Vindicator bombers
of the Strategic Air Command on routine patrol

19:03.037 --> 19:06.033
Each one of those planes
carries four Bloodhound air-to-air missiles

19:06.033 --> 19:07.555
armed with nuclear warheads.

19:07.555 --> 19:10.192
Those are for use against
attacking enemy fighter planes.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.779
In addition, of course, each plane carries
two 20-megaton hydrogen bombs

19:13.779 --> 19:15.559
designed to detonate over enemy targets.

19:15.559 --> 19:19.255
At any given moment, night or day,
flights of those aeroplanes are in the air,

19:19.255 --> 19:21.198
in case of any surprise attack on our bases.

19:21.198 --> 19:22.842
You can see some of the other groups...

19:22.842 --> 19:24.422
- Who controls them?
- We do.

19:24.422 --> 19:27.777
This is the nerve center, Mr Raskob.
This room.

19:27.777 --> 19:31.192
All these machines you see
are constantly receiving information

19:31.227 --> 19:32.942
- from all over the world.
- And above it.

19:33.746 --> 19:37.057
Mr Knapp's company did the electronic work
on the Argo satellite.

19:37.147 --> 19:40.583
Would you like to see
what it's photographing right now? Colonel.

19:41.187 --> 19:44.977
This picture you're about to see,
Mr Raskob, is being taken now,

19:45.069 --> 19:49.221
by a camera 300 miles in the sky
traveling at 20,000 miles an hour.

19:53.909 --> 19:55.820
Can you give us tighter scale on this,
General?

19:55.909 --> 19:57.137
Colonel?

20:13.111 --> 20:16.023
Those are the rocket sites
from 300 miles up.

20:16.791 --> 20:19.430
- I'm impressed.
- We'll get it sharper than that before long.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.706
Be able to see the people,
not just the machines.

20:21.791 --> 20:24.704
We'll show you the hair on their head,
Mr Raskob.

20:24.793 --> 20:27.944
- I suppose they're doing the same to us.
- Well, you can see for yourself.

20:28.033 --> 20:30.546
Colonel, let's take a look
at the Russian submarines in the Pacific.

20:30.632 --> 20:33.544
There's the western coast
of the United States, Hawaiian Islands

20:33.632 --> 20:35.145
and those are Russian subs.

20:35.232 --> 20:36.631
That close?

20:36.712 --> 20:39.749
Nearest is about 50 miles off San Francisco,
I'd say.

20:39.832 --> 20:42.983
International waters.
Nothing we can do except keep an eye on it.

20:43.072 --> 20:45.542
Well, that's too damn close.
What's it doing there?

20:45.634 --> 20:48.832
- Scanning us, the way we do them.
- Is it armed?

21:04.955 --> 21:08.107
We have instruments so good, Mr Raskob,
they can tell the difference

21:08.196 --> 21:11.984
between a whale breaking wind
and that sub blowing its tanks.

21:12.076 --> 21:16.354
No argument, General. I'm sure we've got
the best that money can buy.

21:18.116 --> 21:21.154
- We're very proud of what we do here, sir.
- You ought to be, Colonel.

21:21.237 --> 21:25.026
- The money is well spent, Mr Raskob.
- I don't doubt it for a minute.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.471
And you don't have to snow me, General.

21:26.558 --> 21:29.073
My committee doesn't deal
with appropriations,

21:29.159 --> 21:31.114
only with how the appropriations are spent.

21:31.198 --> 21:34.873
Well, you see it all around you.
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

21:36.118 --> 21:38.837
Well, I'll tell you the truth,
these machines scare the hell out of me.

21:38.918 --> 21:40.954
I don't like the idea
that every time I take off my hat,

21:41.038 --> 21:43.791
some thing up there knows
I'm losing my hair.

21:43.878 --> 21:46.347
I wanna be damn sure
that thing doesn't get any ideas of its own.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.909
I see what you mean, Mr Raskob, but that's
a chance you take with these systems.

21:49.999 --> 21:51.956
But who says we have to take that chance?

21:52.040 --> 21:55.078
Who voted who the power to do it
this particular way?

21:55.161 --> 21:57.038
I'm the only one around here
got elected by anybody.

21:57.121 --> 21:58.349
Nobody gave me that power.

21:58.441 --> 22:01.910
It's in the nature of technology.
Machines are developed to meet situations.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.956
Then they take over,
they start creating situations.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.268
Not necessarily.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.352
There's always the chance.
You said so yourself.

22:07.441 --> 22:10.319
Well, we have checks on everything,
Mr Raskob. Checks and counter-checks.

22:10.401 --> 22:12.040
Yeah, but who checks the checker?

22:12.122 --> 22:14.761
Where's the end of the line, Joe?
Who's got the responsibility?

22:14.842 --> 22:16.036
- The President.
- No one.

22:16.322 --> 22:19.917
He can't know everything that's going on.
How can he? It's too complicated.

22:20.002 --> 22:22.880
If you want to know,
that's what really bothers me.

22:22.962 --> 22:25.954
The only thing everyone can agree on
is that no one's responsible.

22:31.044 --> 22:32.635
Is something wrong, General?

22:32.723 --> 22:35.238
UFO sighted near Hudson Bay, sir.

22:36.404 --> 22:39.202
What you're seeing, gentlemen,
is an unidentified flying object

22:39.284 --> 22:40.956
picked up by our radar.

22:41.044 --> 22:43.763
Until we get positive identification,
we regard it as hostile.

22:43.844 --> 22:45.516
What do you do about it?

22:45.604 --> 22:48.802
Well, we've gone to Condition Blue,
which is our lowest form of readiness.

22:48.885 --> 22:51.274
At the same time, we've informed
those Vindicator bombers

22:51.365 --> 22:54.004
that you saw in the air before.

22:54.085 --> 22:57.761
They will now start to fly
towards their fail-safe points.

22:57.846 --> 22:59.438
"Fail-safe"?

23:00.486 --> 23:02.920
Fixed points in the sky
on the perimeter of the Soviet Union

23:03.006 --> 23:04.644
which are changed from day to day.

23:04.726 --> 23:09.084
The planes will fly to those points and orbit
until they get a positive order to go in.

23:09.167 --> 23:12.842
- And if they don't get that order?
- They return to their normal patrols.

23:12.927 --> 23:16.159
In short, Mr Raskob, we can't go to war
except on an express order.

23:16.368 --> 23:18.165
How do they get that order, by radio?

23:18.328 --> 23:21.718
Yes, and through a box we call
the fail-safe box aboard each plane

23:21.928 --> 23:24.840
which can only be activated
at the express order of the President.

23:25.008 --> 23:27.522
- Oh, he has to tell them?
- Not directly. No.

23:27.608 --> 23:29.247
His voice can be imitated, you know.

23:29.329 --> 23:32.082
He just gives the order
and the rest is done electronically.

23:32.169 --> 23:35.764
No one can interfere with the fail-safe box,
Mr Raskob. No one.

23:37.930 --> 23:39.886
All those new blips you see
are fighter planes

23:39.970 --> 23:42.325
going after the unidentified object.

23:42.410 --> 23:44.924
Colonel Cascio, tight scale, please.

23:48.090 --> 23:50.321
You seem pretty cool about this, General.
Does it happen often?

23:50.411 --> 23:54.199
Oh, about six times a month.
Probably an airliner off course.

23:55.051 --> 23:57.963
- And if it isn't?
- Well, then it's something else.

23:59.652 --> 24:04.441
That means it's at 30,000 feet,
going 525 miles an hour

24:04.531 --> 24:06.886
on a compass heading of 196.

24:06.971 --> 24:08.450
Headed right for Detroit.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.603
Seven minutes to fail-safe.

24:14.373 --> 24:16.887
Oh, normal procedure, Mr Raskob.

24:16.973 --> 24:19.693
We start an automatic countdown
at this point.

24:21.534 --> 24:24.651
It's very unlikely the bombers
will even reach their fail-safe points.

24:24.734 --> 24:26.770
I'd say it happens about one time in 20.

24:27.574 --> 24:30.214
We usually identify the disturbance
well before that.

24:43.976 --> 24:45.807
Six minutes to fail-safe.

24:48.976 --> 24:51.935
What have you got there, Blackie?
Another UFO?

24:52.857 --> 24:56.372
For a dollar,
a commercial plane or a flock of birds?

24:56.457 --> 24:58.527
Plane. Off course.

24:58.617 --> 25:00.335
You ought to give me odds.

25:01.697 --> 25:04.258
Yes, be sure you give me that...

25:04.338 --> 25:08.376
I read your memo
on counterforce credibility.

25:08.457 --> 25:11.495
I don't think Groeteschele's
going to discuss that today.

25:12.778 --> 25:14.655
You mean you think I should lay off?

25:14.738 --> 25:16.410
Why open a can of peas?

25:16.498 --> 25:18.888
Well, we've got to discuss it
one of these days, Stark.

25:18.979 --> 25:20.492
This whole policy of overkill,

25:20.579 --> 25:23.173
it makes no sense piling up bombs
when we already have a capacity...

25:23.259 --> 25:25.933
Okay, Blackie, just not today.

25:28.140 --> 25:30.859
- Good morning, Mr Secretary.
- Morning, Mr Secretary.

25:30.940 --> 25:33.136
- Wort you sit over there?
- Thank you.

25:36.260 --> 25:39.138
- Morning, Mr Secretary.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

25:47.381 --> 25:50.020
- Everyone here, General Stark?
- Yes, sir.

25:55.223 --> 25:57.293
All right, Professor Groeteschele.

25:58.463 --> 26:02.900
I see we have an alert
to supplement our discussion.

26:02.983 --> 26:06.613
Unfortunately, we settled the question
of accidental war last week

26:06.704 --> 26:08.819
so we can't make use of it today.

26:10.743 --> 26:14.339
Today, the subject is limited war.
It is not theoretical.

26:15.184 --> 26:18.779
On it depends the kind of weapons we use,
where we locate them, how we use them.

26:18.864 --> 26:20.661
In short, our entire military posture.

26:20.744 --> 26:23.895
So, is limited war possible?

26:23.984 --> 26:26.863
Can we confine
the exchange of nuclear weapons

26:26.945 --> 26:28.299
to military targets alone,

26:28.386 --> 26:31.935
or must war lead inevitably
to the destruction of cities?

26:32.026 --> 26:34.222
- It must.
- Why?

26:34.707 --> 26:38.904
The object of war is
to inflict maximum damage on the enemy,

26:38.986 --> 26:41.136
destroy his ability to resist.

26:41.226 --> 26:44.343
In the last war, both sides
could have used bacterial warfare.

26:44.426 --> 26:45.461
They didn't.

26:45.586 --> 26:47.383
It wouldn't have been decisive.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.422
Can you be sure?

26:49.507 --> 26:52.579
Well, maybe people still couldn't
get used to the idea of killing civilians.

26:52.667 --> 26:57.503
I suggest you take that up with the civilians
of London, Hamburg, Dresden or Tokyo,

26:57.588 --> 27:00.023
killed by the thousands in bombing raids.

27:00.229 --> 27:01.901
I omit Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

27:01.989 --> 27:04.822
since those actions belong more properly
to World War III

27:04.909 --> 27:06.262
than World War II.

27:06.349 --> 27:09.579
I still don't see how we could restrict a war.

27:09.788 --> 27:12.747
We could come to a mutual agreement
with the Russians

27:13.750 --> 27:15.627
to strike only at missile bases.

27:15.710 --> 27:18.178
What if the missile bases
were near the cities?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.101
They would have an incentive
to move them elsewhere.

27:20.190 --> 27:23.500
They might take such an offer
as a sign of weakness on our part.

27:23.590 --> 27:27.378
- It could be worth a try.
- They've got as much to lose as we have.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.540
We're talking about the wrong subject.

27:30.830 --> 27:32.549
We've got to stop war, not limit it.

27:33.871 --> 27:37.229
That is not up to us, General Black.

27:37.313 --> 27:38.871
We're the ones who know most about it.

27:38.953 --> 27:40.704
You're a soldier, Blackie.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.511
You carry out policy. You don't make it.

27:43.592 --> 27:45.105
Don't kid yourself, Stark.

27:45.192 --> 27:48.104
The way we say a war can be fought
is making policy.

27:48.192 --> 27:51.184
If we say we can fight a limited war
with nuclear weapons,

27:51.272 --> 27:54.903
all we do is let everyone off the hook.
It's what they want to hear.

27:54.994 --> 27:58.589
We can just keep on doing what we're
doing, and nobody really gets hurt.

27:58.674 --> 28:00.790
But you can't fight a limited war,
and you know it.

28:00.874 --> 28:02.592
For my part, I'm not so sure.

28:02.674 --> 28:05.393
There's no such thing
as a limited war anymore.

28:05.474 --> 28:08.147
Not with hydrogen bombs, there isn't.

28:08.235 --> 28:11.067
Once those bombs start to drop,
you won't be able to limit a damn thing.

28:12.354 --> 28:15.985
Are you advocating disarmament,
General Black?

28:20.316 --> 28:21.635
I don't know.

28:21.716 --> 28:23.946
Well, it's the logic of your position.

28:24.956 --> 28:27.789
Peculiar reversal.
The press would be interested.

28:27.876 --> 28:31.710
The military man who is the dove,
and the civilian who is the hawk.

28:34.636 --> 28:38.313
We're going too fast.
Things are getting out of hand.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.787
Can you be more specific, General?

28:41.597 --> 28:43.350
We're all trying to make war more efficient.

28:43.438 --> 28:46.236
- That's our job.
- And we're succeeding.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.395
We now have the capacity to blow up
the whole world several times over.

28:49.598 --> 28:51.873
Which does not mean we must do it.

28:51.958 --> 28:53.357
We won't be able to stop from doing it.

28:53.438 --> 28:56.158
That's the logic of your position,
Groeteschele.

28:57.239 --> 29:01.552
We're setting up a war machine that acts
faster than the ability of men to control it.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.632
We're putting men into situations
that are getting too tough for men to handle.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.551
Then we must toughen the men.

29:06.640 --> 29:09.234
Suppose they launch
a first strike against us?

29:09.680 --> 29:12.989
Then we retaliate, and we're all finished.

29:13.319 --> 29:16.552
Oh, would you prefer
that only we were finished?

29:16.801 --> 29:18.200
We have to prepare.

29:20.402 --> 29:21.676
We're preparing.

29:23.402 --> 29:24.471
We've got to slow down.

29:24.562 --> 29:27.759
I disagree. We have got to speed up.

29:28.202 --> 29:30.477
Naturally, that means taking risks,

29:30.562 --> 29:33.440
but our intention is always
to minimize those risks.

29:34.042 --> 29:37.000
Of course, we can only control
our own actions.

29:37.083 --> 29:41.600
Our concept of limited war is based on an
equal rationality on the part of the Russians.

29:41.684 --> 29:45.073
It also presupposes
there will be no accidents on either side.

29:45.723 --> 29:50.035
But suppose, for an example,
that unidentified flying object

29:50.123 --> 29:53.560
was one of their 50-megaton missiles
that had gotten loose by mistake.

29:53.644 --> 29:56.522
What could be done? How could they prove
it was really an accident?

29:56.604 --> 29:58.641
Would it make any difference if they could?

29:58.725 --> 30:02.844
Even if we believe them, should we still
think in terms of limiting our response

30:02.926 --> 30:05.360
or should we hit them back
with everything we have?

30:07.606 --> 30:09.836
It's gone, General. What happened to it?

30:09.926 --> 30:11.245
- Colonel Cascio...
- Sir.

30:11.326 --> 30:13.555
...let's go to Condition Yellow.
- Yes, sir.

30:14.005 --> 30:17.122
It's dropped below the level
at which our radar can pick it up, that's all.

30:17.205 --> 30:18.924
You went to the next state of readiness.

30:19.006 --> 30:20.598
Well, that's SOP, Mr Knapp.

30:20.686 --> 30:22.517
It could be a commercial plane
about to crash.

30:22.606 --> 30:24.997
Or an enemy plane taking evasive action.

30:25.568 --> 30:27.479
Naturally, we prepare for the worst.

30:27.568 --> 30:29.320
Two minutes to fail-safe.

30:34.488 --> 30:36.683
What are those planes
following the bombers, General?

30:36.768 --> 30:38.805
Fighter support. Part of Condition Yellow.

30:38.889 --> 30:42.518
From now on, they'll take a refuelling and
they'll follow the bombers as far as they go.

30:42.609 --> 30:45.282
- What comes after Condition Yellow?
- Green.

30:45.369 --> 30:48.998
- And then?
- Red. But we've never gone to red yet.

30:49.089 --> 30:50.841
Red means war, doesn't it?

31:07.932 --> 31:10.446
- Not an air breather?
- What does that mean?

31:10.532 --> 31:12.443
Well, jet planes suck air
through their engines.

31:12.532 --> 31:15.204
Our warning system can pick up
the turbulence this creates.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.247
It could be a commercial plane
that's lost power,

31:17.331 --> 31:18.969
no turbulence would be created.

31:19.051 --> 31:22.010
- It could be a rocket.
- Off course?

31:23.132 --> 31:24.850
Maybe on.

31:24.932 --> 31:26.924
One minute to fail-safe.

31:28.093 --> 31:31.324
It could be a Russian rocket, sir, coming in
low where our radar can't pick it up.

31:31.413 --> 31:33.005
- Could it be that?
- It could be anything.

31:33.093 --> 31:35.164
- Well, how do you find out?
- Our fighters are tracking it.

31:35.254 --> 31:36.323
Countdown will now be in seconds.

31:36.414 --> 31:37.608
- Can't wait too long.
- 15, 14

31:37.694 --> 31:42.052
13, 12, 11, 10, 9,

31:42.135 --> 31:46.412
87, 6, 5, 4

31:46.494 --> 31:48.850
3, 2, 1.

31:48.935 --> 31:51.449
All groups at fail-safe point

31:51.535 --> 31:54.288
Right on the dot. That's flying.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.172
- Colonel Cascio?
- Yes, sir?

31:56.255 --> 31:58.530
- Go to Condition Green.
- Yes, sir.

32:04.576 --> 32:07.774
Tell the planes to keep orbiting until
we get positive identification of the UFO.

32:07.857 --> 32:09.689
They'll do that anyway, sir.
That's their orders.

32:09.778 --> 32:10.972
- Well, tell them again.
- Yes, sir.

32:11.058 --> 32:13.811
- I'll have to ask you gentleman to leave now.
- Sorry.

32:13.898 --> 32:17.048
- That is an order, Mr Raskob.
- You've got the wrong customer, General.

32:17.137 --> 32:19.697
The way I see it, we could be at war
in just about two minutes.

32:19.777 --> 32:21.575
You can't get me back to my family
in that time,

32:21.658 --> 32:24.092
- so I'm staying here to see what happens.
- There's no place for you here.

32:24.178 --> 32:26.567
If those bombs go off, General,
there's no place for me anywhere.

32:26.658 --> 32:28.489
You want me out of here,
you better call those MP's.

32:28.578 --> 32:31.730
- I think it's coming up again.
- We can't wait any longer, sir.

32:31.819 --> 32:33.377
Give me a tight scale.

33:17.064 --> 33:19.816
That's it, gentlemen. Sorry we alarmed you.

33:19.903 --> 33:22.371
Contact all the planes
and have them resume their normal patrols.

33:22.463 --> 33:23.613
Yes, sir.

33:31.264 --> 33:34.495
- Colonel Grady?
- Yes, what is it, Thomas?

33:35.025 --> 33:38.540
What's the longest you ever stayed
at these fail-safe points?

33:39.065 --> 33:43.935
The longest I ever stayed was three minutes,
but I can tell you it seems like three years.

33:45.146 --> 33:47.455
- This your first time?
- Yes, sir.

33:47.746 --> 33:49.701
- Nervous?
- No, sir.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.783
It's only natural, you know.

33:53.786 --> 33:56.220
I was just calculating fuel, sir.

33:59.827 --> 34:02.341
How is the group holding formation,
Sullivan?

34:02.427 --> 34:04.225
They're right in orbit, sir.

34:04.308 --> 34:06.185
Even Number Six is tucked in.

34:07.508 --> 34:09.226
Old Flynn.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.858
Half man, half bird.

34:14.148 --> 34:17.777
Well, thank you very much, General.
I must say, it was quite a full trip.

34:19.668 --> 34:21.898
- What's that, Colonel?
- Checking, sir.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.429
Okay here.

34:43.031 --> 34:44.623
Send in a K-13.

34:47.952 --> 34:51.705
Something blew in the fault indicator, sir.
We're replacing the whole unit.

34:51.791 --> 34:54.259
The fault indicator is our master control.

34:54.351 --> 34:57.103
It tells us if something goes wrong
in any of these other components.

34:57.191 --> 35:00.104
- Did something go wrong?
- No sign of it.

35:00.192 --> 35:02.753
We'll know as soon as they replace the unit.

35:19.834 --> 35:21.471
Sir, the fail-safe box.

35:29.955 --> 35:33.505
There must be some mistake there.
Check Omaha.

35:40.436 --> 35:41.835
Can't get through, Colonel. Interference.

35:41.916 --> 35:44.147
What'd you mean, you can't get through?
What kind of interference?

35:44.237 --> 35:45.955
I don't know, sir.
It's a kind I never heard before.

35:46.037 --> 35:47.915
Well, try another band. Try all of them.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.069
Can't get through, Colonel.

35:56.077 --> 35:58.272
They must be trying to keep us
from getting our "go" signal.

35:58.357 --> 35:59.949
Well, they're too late for that.

36:00.837 --> 36:03.590
Request permission to authenticate
on secondary channel.

36:03.677 --> 36:05.111
Permission granted.

36:19.440 --> 36:23.352
Order confirmed.
Request permission to verify, sir.

36:24.439 --> 36:25.873
Permission granted.

37:00.883 --> 37:04.273
- Code sequence correct for today, sir.
- Signal is go.

37:06.323 --> 37:09.715
We will now both open
our operational orders.

37:41.407 --> 37:44.046
Ready for approach
and penetration orders, sir.

37:48.847 --> 37:51.444
So you say these alerts happen
half a dozen times a month?

37:51.530 --> 37:53.725
About that. Not usually so dramatic.

37:53.810 --> 37:57.404
- We rarely get to the fail-safe point.
- Well, I'd be a nervous wreck.

37:57.489 --> 37:59.878
Well, so would I
if I had to make a speech in Congress.

37:59.969 --> 38:02.039
- Oh, yeah?
- General Bogan?

38:02.129 --> 38:04.689
That blip up there at 10:00.

38:04.889 --> 38:06.481
It's headed into Russia.

38:12.330 --> 38:14.845
And that is why some people advocate
a return to manned bombers

38:14.931 --> 38:17.491
for a first-strike retaliation,
rather than missiles.

38:17.571 --> 38:21.450
They are slower and therefore
give more time for evaluation and analysis.

38:21.531 --> 38:23.363
The rockets have the defects of their virtues.

38:23.452 --> 38:26.682
They are too quick.
They allow too little time for thought.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.921
Now I find this point of view old-fashioned.

38:29.011 --> 38:32.721
By the very nature of modern warfare, the...

38:33.933 --> 38:36.049
Put that on polar projection.

38:51.214 --> 38:52.966
- Colonel Cascio.
- Yes, sir?

38:53.054 --> 38:55.090
- Get me the President.
- Yes, sir.

38:56.134 --> 39:00.413
- I'm Buck, the translator. They sent for me.
- May I see your identification, sir?

39:02.855 --> 39:06.404
Buck, it says you have a small scar
on your left wrist. May I see it, please?

39:06.495 --> 39:07.689
Oh, yeah.

39:07.775 --> 39:10.209
- Dog bit me when I was a kid.
- Yes, sir.

39:21.817 --> 39:24.126
Hello, Buck. How's your Russian today

39:24.217 --> 39:25.491
Fine, sir,

39:26.536 --> 39:27.730
I guess.

39:27.816 --> 39:29.772
Good. We may need it.

39:32.178 --> 39:34.487
Hang on, Jennie. It's a long way down.

39:43.659 --> 39:47.049
Tell Joe nothing leaks to the newspapers,
nothing. Not yet, anyway.

39:47.139 --> 39:50.814
I'll call the Vice President and tell him
what's up. He'll know what to do.

39:50.899 --> 39:53.972
On second thought,
we'd better tell the press something.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.772
Have Joe tell them it's urgent,
but not a bone-breaker so far.

39:57.859 --> 39:59.578
And off the record, no leaks.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.970
Any leaks on this, the guy and his paper
are dead now and forever, you got that?

40:03.060 --> 40:04.129
I'll tell Joe in just those words.

40:04.220 --> 40:07.179
Now then, who's at the Pentagon briefing
today I want them in on this.

40:08.181 --> 40:10.854
Secretary of Defense. Chiefs of Staff.

40:10.941 --> 40:13.695
That Professor Groeteschele
they like so much, he's giving the lecture.

40:13.782 --> 40:15.773
- Is Blackie there?
- There's a General Black.

40:15.862 --> 40:18.934
That's Blackie. I'm glad he's there.
We went to college together.

40:19.022 --> 40:20.250
Got a brain and says what he thinks.

40:20.342 --> 40:22.095
Okay, Jennie, that's all for now. Get to work.

40:22.183 --> 40:23.616
And tell them to turn up
the air-conditioning.

40:23.703 --> 40:25.102
It's hot as hell down here.

40:26.583 --> 40:28.971
We're far enough down. Maybe it is hell.

40:33.143 --> 40:35.611
- You know what's happened, Buck?
- No, sir.

40:36.023 --> 40:38.298
One of our Vindicator groups
got a wrong signal.

40:38.383 --> 40:41.262
They took off to bomb Moscow.
We've got to stop it.

40:42.185 --> 40:43.982
Easier said than done.

40:44.785 --> 40:48.175
Buck, we've got a little time.
Not much, but a little, so relax.

40:49.425 --> 40:51.177
Easier said than done, sir.

40:52.305 --> 40:53.659
If things get really hot,

40:53.746 --> 40:57.056
I might have to use the direct phone to
the Kremlin. That's where you'll come in.

40:57.146 --> 41:00.137
- But let's hope we don't get that far.
- I hope not, sir.

41:01.745 --> 41:04.738
- General Bogan from Omaha, sir.
- Put him on.

41:05.506 --> 41:08.703
Group Six is now about 200 miles
past fail-safe, Mr President.

41:08.786 --> 41:10.583
We still can't make contact.

41:10.666 --> 41:13.658
- Do you know what went wrong?
- No, sir, we do not.

41:13.746 --> 41:15.864
Why can't you raise them by radio?

41:16.748 --> 41:18.227
We don't know for sure, sir.

41:18.308 --> 41:20.947
We've tried all frequencies.
We just can't make contact.

41:21.268 --> 41:22.621
- Why?
- I don't know.

41:23.188 --> 41:25.259
We had a flash on the board
just before it happened

41:25.349 --> 41:27.579
and the fault indicator blew out
at the same time.

41:27.669 --> 41:29.387
The Russians may be
jamming their reception

41:29.468 --> 41:31.299
with some new device
we know nothing about.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.344
Why would they do that? Is it customary?

41:33.468 --> 41:35.107
No, sir, but it's possible.

41:35.709 --> 41:36.778
In other words,

41:36.869 --> 41:40.020
it's possible the fail-safe mechanism
might be giving them a "go" signal

41:40.109 --> 41:43.499
at the same time they can't reach you
for positive confirmation.

41:43.589 --> 41:45.944
It's possible. It's not probable, but...

41:46.270 --> 41:47.385
Is it possible?

41:48.431 --> 41:49.500
Yes, sir.

41:49.591 --> 41:52.469
All right. Now, if we do regain radio contact,

41:52.551 --> 41:54.781
will the bombers respond
to an order to return?

41:55.112 --> 41:56.864
If we can reach them
within the next five minutes.

41:56.952 --> 41:59.671
After that, their orders are
to disregard any verbal command.

42:00.551 --> 42:02.621
If I talk to them? Even from me?

42:02.711 --> 42:06.260
Your voice can be imitated by the enemy,
sir. Our men have been drilled in that.

42:06.351 --> 42:10.186
Once they're beyond a certain point
they're not to trust any verbal transmission.

42:10.672 --> 42:13.391
What's our next step then, General,
if we follow standard procedure?

42:14.592 --> 42:16.345
We already have fighter planes in the air.

42:16.433 --> 42:19.072
The next step would be to order
the fighters after the bombers,

42:19.153 --> 42:21.826
to raise them visually
and divert them from their course.

42:22.273 --> 42:24.185
What if the bombers don't respond,
then what?

42:25.274 --> 42:28.391
The fighters would be ordered
to shoot them down.

42:33.154 --> 42:34.303
Who gives that order?

42:35.354 --> 42:36.344
You do, sir.

42:40.795 --> 42:43.184
Thank you, General. I'll be back to you.

42:45.035 --> 42:46.673
Get me Mr Swenson in the Pentagon.

43:07.997 --> 43:09.225
Swenson here.

43:09.437 --> 43:13.113
Mr Secretary, I have a decision to make.
It's my decision, and I'll make it,

43:13.198 --> 43:15.871
but I want the advice of you and your people
and I need it fast.

43:19.159 --> 43:23.311
The President says he may have to order
our fighters to shoot down Group Six.

43:24.999 --> 43:26.193
He wants our opinion.

43:26.279 --> 43:29.237
I oppose it, sir,
on the grounds that it's premature.

43:30.159 --> 43:32.879
Our planes have not yet
reached Soviet territory.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.518
They're still hundreds of miles away.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.114
We've got to do it and fast.
Right now before it's too late.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.157
Might be too late anyway.

43:39.241 --> 43:42.039
Those fighters swung away from
the bombers when they got the all clear.

43:42.121 --> 43:43.679
They've been flying in opposite directions.

43:43.761 --> 43:45.513
But they're faster than the Vindicators.

43:45.601 --> 43:48.957
Not that much faster.
I'm not sure they can catch up in time.

43:49.041 --> 43:51.601
They can go to afterburners.
That'll increase their speed.

43:51.681 --> 43:53.194
And use up their fuel?

43:53.281 --> 43:56.001
They'll never be able to get back.
They'll go down in the ocean.

43:56.082 --> 43:58.916
- We've got to try it.
- Suppose they do catch up?

43:59.003 --> 44:01.597
Why do they have to attack?
Can't they signal?

44:01.683 --> 44:03.957
Our men have been trained
to expect anything from the enemy.

44:04.042 --> 44:06.637
Even sending up his own fighter planes
disguised as ours.

44:06.723 --> 44:08.361
They're good men. We've seen to that.

44:08.443 --> 44:11.833
If their orders are attack, the only way you're
gonna stop them is to shoot them down.

44:11.923 --> 44:13.720
We've got no alternative.

44:14.003 --> 44:17.792
This minute the Russians are watching their
boards trying to figure out what we're up to.

44:17.884 --> 44:21.844
If we can't convince them it's an accident
which we're trying to correct by any means,

44:21.925 --> 44:25.395
we're going to have something
on our hands that nobody bargained for

44:25.485 --> 44:27.123
and only a lunatic wants.

44:29.845 --> 44:34.122
Mr President, it is our opinion
that the fighters should be ordered in.

44:34.604 --> 44:35.719
Thank you.

44:40.807 --> 44:42.320
General Bogan, please.

44:53.727 --> 44:55.160
Yes, Mr President?

44:55.967 --> 45:00.360
The fighters are to overtake the Vindicators
and, if necessary, shoot them down.

45:01.689 --> 45:04.442
Sir, it will be necessary.

45:04.848 --> 45:06.998
I know that, General. Order them in.

45:16.729 --> 45:19.448
Colonel, order the fighters
to attack Group Six.

45:21.291 --> 45:24.328
They don't have a prayer
of catching them, sir.

45:25.451 --> 45:26.804
That is an order.

45:28.211 --> 45:30.930
But it's the Arctic Ocean
they'll go down in, General.

45:31.011 --> 45:34.162
They'll freeze to death
before they get their chutes off.

45:34.931 --> 45:37.763
Colonel, get on the horn and give that order.

45:37.850 --> 45:40.843
Every second you wait
takes them farther away.

45:42.172 --> 45:44.925
We're killing them, General,
and they haven't got a chance.

45:45.532 --> 45:47.170
This is Fighter Direction.

45:47.252 --> 45:49.767
We are in voice communication
with Tangle-Abel-One.

45:49.853 --> 45:52.765
You can talk to them on Channel 7,
single side band.

45:56.133 --> 45:58.442
Do I tell them in code or in the clear?

45:58.613 --> 46:00.012
In the clear.

46:01.934 --> 46:04.495
Tangle-Abel-One, this is Colonel Cascio
at Ultimate One.

46:04.575 --> 46:07.168
This is Tangle-Abel-One.
I read you five-by-five.

46:07.254 --> 46:09.085
Group Six has flown
through the fail-safe point

46:09.174 --> 46:11.051
and is on an attack course towards Moscow.

46:11.134 --> 46:13.773
It is a mistake. Repeat, it is a mistake.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.812
Go to afterburners
and overtake and attack Group Six.

46:18.534 --> 46:19.649
Roger.

46:19.734 --> 46:23.092
Go to afterburners
and overtake and attack Group Six.

46:24.617 --> 46:26.448
Did you all hear that order?

46:28.097 --> 46:31.169
Overtake the Vindicators?
Who are they kidding?

46:31.777 --> 46:33.608
All we got
is a 50-mile-an-hour edge on them,

46:33.697 --> 46:35.335
and they're halfway to Moscow already.

46:35.417 --> 46:37.452
You heard the man. We go to afterburners.

46:37.536 --> 46:39.970
And use what to run this aeroplane? Spit?

46:40.736 --> 46:44.207
By the time we run out of gas,
they'll only be 1,000 miles away.

46:44.297 --> 46:45.890
Man, that's organisation.

46:45.978 --> 46:50.051
All right, cut the chatter, we're wasting time.
On the mark, go to afterburners.

46:50.138 --> 46:54.529
Five, four, three, two, one, mark.

47:01.659 --> 47:03.730
Shall I alert Air-Sea Rescue, sir?

47:07.101 --> 47:08.818
No. No point.

47:10.500 --> 47:13.219
Bring up the fighters on the board
in tight scale.

47:13.300 --> 47:14.369
Yes, sir.

47:22.220 --> 47:23.495
Beautiful.

47:29.622 --> 47:31.375
Fighters on their way, sir.

47:34.183 --> 47:35.332
Thank you.

47:38.223 --> 47:42.010
Buck, let's hope this all blows over
in the next few minutes.

47:43.222 --> 47:45.498
But if it doesn't, we're going to
get to know each other very well.

47:45.583 --> 47:49.053
I want you to listen to every conversation
I have, try to get to know how I think.

47:49.144 --> 47:51.704
- It might come in handy.
- Yes, sir.

47:55.024 --> 47:58.334
- How did General Bogan sound to you?
- Sir?

47:58.904 --> 48:02.579
Did he sound worried? Confident? Scared?

48:03.184 --> 48:06.701
Well, not... Not scared.
A little worried, I guess.

48:07.186 --> 48:10.461
Bogan's an old-time flier, but he's not afraid
of all this new equipment.

48:10.546 --> 48:12.423
If he's worried, I'm worried.

48:12.986 --> 48:16.023
You know Mr Swenson,
the Secretary of Defence?

48:16.106 --> 48:17.824
I've read about him, sir.

48:17.906 --> 48:20.943
You won't be able to tell much
from his voice. He's hard as a rock.

48:21.026 --> 48:22.778
But we listen to him, Buck.

48:23.506 --> 48:26.465
- If he gives advice, we take it.
- Yes, sir.

48:31.787 --> 48:33.141
Yes, sir.

48:33.228 --> 48:35.184
Will you put the war conference room
at the Pentagon

48:35.268 --> 48:37.543
and General Bogan in Omaha
on a conference line with me?

48:37.628 --> 48:38.744
Yes, sir.

48:41.268 --> 48:42.383
Ready, sir.

48:42.868 --> 48:45.224
- Mr Swenson?
- Yes, Mr President.

48:45.309 --> 48:49.097
If our fighters have to shoot down
the Vindicators, the worst is over.

48:49.789 --> 48:51.222
For us, anyway.

48:51.829 --> 48:55.061
I want your people now to consider
what we do if they can't shoot them down.

48:55.150 --> 48:57.505
I'm putting you on the intercom so
everything you say can be heard here

48:57.590 --> 48:58.579
and in Omaha.

48:58.710 --> 49:02.259
General Bogan has Mr Knapp
of Amalgamated Electronics

49:02.350 --> 49:05.069
and Congressman Raskob with him.

49:05.150 --> 49:07.790
They have my permission to listen in
and say anything they want.

49:07.871 --> 49:08.986
Right, sir.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.145
Gentlemen,

49:13.231 --> 49:16.463
we've got four questions to answer
and not a hell of a lot of time.

49:16.552 --> 49:19.749
First, what happened?
Second, what do we do about it?

49:20.152 --> 49:22.143
Third, what are the Russians
going to think of all this?

49:22.232 --> 49:24.871
And fourth,
what are they going to do about it?

49:24.952 --> 49:27.467
Please keep the discussion to those points.

49:28.313 --> 49:31.589
Mechanical failure. That's what happened.

49:31.673 --> 49:34.904
A double mechanical failure?
Do you know the odds against that, sir?

49:34.993 --> 49:37.713
- Maybe someone went berserk.
- It doesn't matter.

49:38.594 --> 49:42.552
Something failed. A man, a machine.
It was bound to happen, and it did.

49:42.793 --> 49:46.913
Maybe we'll never know why or what.
It doesn't matter now.

49:46.995 --> 49:48.747
- Mr Secretary.
- Yes, General Bogan.

49:48.835 --> 49:51.508
Mr Knapp here knows as much
about electronic gear as anyone.

49:51.595 --> 49:52.823
He'd like to say something.

49:52.915 --> 49:55.793
The more complex
an electronic system gets,

49:56.315 --> 49:58.466
the more accident-prone it is.

49:58.556 --> 50:00.945
- Sooner or later, it breaks down.
- What breaks down?

50:01.116 --> 50:04.188
A transistor blows, a condenser burns out.

50:04.516 --> 50:06.984
Sometimes they just get tired, like people.

50:07.237 --> 50:12.186
Mr Knapp overlooks one factor.
The machines are supervised by humans.

50:12.276 --> 50:16.110
Even if the machine fails, a human being
can always correct the mistake.

50:16.196 --> 50:21.113
I wish you were right.
But the fact is, the machines work so fast,

50:21.558 --> 50:25.836
they are so intricate,
the mistakes they make are so subtle

50:26.198 --> 50:28.474
that very often, a human being
just can't know

50:28.559 --> 50:30.834
whether a machine is lying
or telling the truth.

50:30.919 --> 50:33.558
Well, maybe this time
there wasn't any failure.

50:34.319 --> 50:37.675
Maybe the Russians have come up with a
way to mask the real position of Group Six.

50:37.759 --> 50:40.194
Maybe Group Six is flying back
to the States right this minute.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.312
Then what's on the board? Northern lights?

50:42.600 --> 50:45.238
Maybe a group of Soviet planes,
up there for just that reason.

50:45.319 --> 50:47.913
To convince us that we've accidentally
launched a bomber group against them.

50:47.999 --> 50:49.911
- For what purpose?
- As an excuse to retaliate.

50:50.280 --> 50:53.033
If they wanted to do that, they wouldn't
need an excuse. They'd simply attack.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.157
This way, they've made us commit
a group of our fighter planes,

50:55.241 --> 50:56.435
our first line of defense.

50:57.001 --> 50:58.354
They've made us kill our own men.

50:58.441 --> 51:00.318
I disagree with Colonel Cascio's analysis.

51:00.401 --> 51:03.439
I think we have to assume that
it is our accident and not their plan.

51:03.522 --> 51:05.194
I go along with you, General.

51:05.282 --> 51:06.351
Yes, Saunders?

51:06.442 --> 51:09.241
A report on what the Russians
have in the air, sir. Seven bomber groups.

51:09.323 --> 51:11.712
- Is that unusual?
- No, that's normal for them.

51:11.803 --> 51:12.997
About like us.

51:13.083 --> 51:14.356
What kind of course are they on?

51:14.442 --> 51:17.161
Normal patrol patterns
inside their own borders.

51:17.842 --> 51:20.151
They do have a large number of fighters
in the air, sir.

51:20.242 --> 51:22.517
Abnormally large.
Almost half their fighter strength.

51:22.602 --> 51:25.800
They're having the same problem
with Group Six that we had with the UFO.

51:25.883 --> 51:28.920
They don't know what it is,
why it's there or who it belongs to.

51:29.003 --> 51:31.200
My guess is
that they know all about Group Six.

51:31.285 --> 51:34.197
They saw it fly to the fail-safe point.
They've seen that happen plenty of times.

51:34.285 --> 51:36.116
They know the procedure. So far, no sweat.

51:36.405 --> 51:38.043
And when they saw it fly past...

51:38.125 --> 51:40.434
They sent up their fighter planes,
just in case.

51:40.525 --> 51:43.119
I don't think they'll take any action
unless their border is crossed.

51:43.205 --> 51:44.275
Agreed.

51:45.405 --> 51:47.316
That puts it up to the fighters.

51:51.246 --> 51:53.965
In my opinion, they will take no action at all.

51:54.606 --> 51:56.836
They are not going to just sit there,
Professor.

51:56.926 --> 51:59.281
I think if our bombers get through,
the Russians will surrender.

51:59.486 --> 52:01.716
Who's this professor, Mr Secretary?
What's he doing there?

52:02.006 --> 52:05.683
Professor Groeteschele is
a civilian advisor to the Pentagon, General.

52:05.768 --> 52:08.202
Will you explain your statement, Professor?

52:08.288 --> 52:10.883
The Russian aim is to dominate the world.

52:10.969 --> 52:13.039
They think that Communism
must succeed eventually

52:13.129 --> 52:15.483
if the Soviet Union is left reasonably intact.

52:15.568 --> 52:18.480
They know that a war would leave
the Soviet Union utterly destroyed.

52:18.568 --> 52:19.967
Therefore, they would surrender.

52:20.048 --> 52:22.198
But suppose they feel
they can knock us off first?

52:22.488 --> 52:24.604
They know
we might have a doomsday system.

52:24.688 --> 52:28.238
Missiles that will go into action days,
even weeks, after a war is over

52:28.329 --> 52:31.686
and destroy an enemy even after
that enemy has already destroyed us.

52:31.770 --> 52:33.840
Maybe they think
that even capitalists aren't that insane.

52:33.930 --> 52:36.205
To want to kill
after they themselves have been killed.

52:36.290 --> 52:38.885
These are Marxist fanatics,
not normal people.

52:38.971 --> 52:41.405
They do not reason the way you reason,
General Black.

52:41.491 --> 52:44.847
They're not motivated by human emotions
such as rage and pity.

52:44.931 --> 52:46.409
They are calculating machines.

52:46.490 --> 52:49.051
They will look at the balance sheet,
and they will see they cannot win.

52:49.131 --> 52:50.962
Then you suggest doing what?

52:53.372 --> 52:54.487
Nothing.

52:55.252 --> 52:57.049
- Nothing?
- The Russians will surrender

52:57.132 --> 52:59.851
and the threat of Communism
will be over forever.

52:59.932 --> 53:02.082
That's a lot of hogwash. Don't kid yourself.

53:02.172 --> 53:04.402
There'll be Russian generals
who will react just as I would,

53:04.492 --> 53:05.811
the best defense is a good offense.

53:05.892 --> 53:08.087
They see trouble coming up,
take my word for it, they'll attack

53:08.172 --> 53:09.606
and they won't give a damn what Marx said.

53:09.893 --> 53:12.045
Mr Secretary, I am convinced

53:12.135 --> 53:14.649
that the moment the Russians know
bombs will fall on Moscow,

53:14.735 --> 53:16.134
they will surrender.

53:16.215 --> 53:19.968
They know that whatever they do then,
they cannot escape destruction.

53:20.134 --> 53:22.443
Don't you see, sir? This is our chance.

53:22.534 --> 53:24.684
We never would have made
the first move deliberately

53:24.774 --> 53:27.368
but Group Six has made it for us,
by accident.

53:27.454 --> 53:30.252
We must take advantage of it.
History demands it.

53:30.334 --> 53:33.646
We must advise the President
not to recall those planes.

53:36.136 --> 53:37.569
They're flaming hot.

53:42.176 --> 53:43.689
He's firing anyway.

54:12.538 --> 54:14.371
There goes Number Two.

54:53.581 --> 54:57.133
Mr President,
the fighters have not succeeded.

54:58.384 --> 55:00.340
They've gone down into the sea.

55:07.664 --> 55:10.224
What are the chances of our bombers
getting through to Moscow?

55:13.024 --> 55:15.664
We've made the calculations
a hundred times.

55:15.745 --> 55:19.705
What they have in the way of defense
is what our planes are capable of doing.

55:19.785 --> 55:21.457
The Vindicators fly so fast,

55:21.545 --> 55:24.981
the Russians won't be able to use
all their defensive apparatus.

55:26.625 --> 55:28.901
One or two of the bombers will get through.

55:31.586 --> 55:32.655
Thank you.

55:37.827 --> 55:40.706
Buck, I'm going to talk
to the Soviet Premier now.

55:42.028 --> 55:43.620
You'll translate what he says to me.

55:43.708 --> 55:46.063
He'll have his own translator
telling him what I say,

55:46.148 --> 55:49.299
- but I want something more from you.
- Yes, sir, whatever I can do.

55:49.388 --> 55:52.459
I think the Premier will be saying
what he means, he usually does.

55:52.547 --> 55:53.866
But sometimes,

55:53.947 --> 55:57.065
there's more in a mars voice
than in his words.

55:57.148 --> 56:00.220
And there are words in one language
that don't carry the same weight in another.

56:00.309 --> 56:01.788
- You... You follow me?
- Well, I think so, sir.

56:01.869 --> 56:04.338
It's very important
the Premier and I understand each other.

56:04.430 --> 56:06.022
I don't have to tell you how important.

56:06.110 --> 56:09.898
So I want to know not only what
he's saying, but what you think he's feeling.

56:10.110 --> 56:12.988
Any inflection of his voice, any tone,

56:13.070 --> 56:17.667
any emotion that adds to his words,
I want you to let me know.

56:17.751 --> 56:18.945
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

56:19.031 --> 56:21.750
I know you will, Buck,
it's all any of us can do.

56:22.071 --> 56:24.187
And don't be afraid to say what you think.

56:24.271 --> 56:27.069
Don't be afraid
all this is too big for you, Buck.

56:27.631 --> 56:31.260
It's big all right, but it still depends
on what each of us does.

56:32.391 --> 56:34.382
History lesson number one.

56:36.793 --> 56:38.431
I'll talk to Moscow now.

57:19.517 --> 57:21.075
It's the Premier, sir.

57:21.597 --> 57:24.394
Mr Chairman, this is the President
of the United States.

57:24.476 --> 57:26.149
Do you hear me clearly?

57:29.197 --> 57:30.630
Fine, Mr President.

57:31.757 --> 57:32.872
How are you?

57:32.957 --> 57:36.347
Mr Chairman, I'm calling you
on a matter of great urgency.

57:36.877 --> 57:40.109
I hope it turns out to be a small matter,

57:40.558 --> 57:43.550
but it's the first time it's happened
and if it's misunderstood, it could be...

57:43.638 --> 57:48.555
Does it have to do with the aircraft
we have detected flying towards Russia?

57:48.640 --> 57:50.039
Yes, Mr Chairman.

57:52.760 --> 57:57.594
I suppose it's another of your
off-course reconnaissance flights.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.438
And Mr President,
we have warned you again and again

58:01.520 --> 58:03.590
that this constant flying of armed aircraft...

58:03.680 --> 58:06.672
- This is a mistake, a serious mistake.
...over Soviet territory cannot...

58:06.760 --> 58:09.150
I say, it's a mistake.

58:12.201 --> 58:15.432
Very well. Tell me. Tell me the mistake.

58:15.521 --> 58:19.436
A group of our bombers,
each loaded with two 20-megaton bombs,

58:19.523 --> 58:21.479
is flying towards your country.

58:24.083 --> 58:28.280
We shall watch with great interest
while you recall them.

58:28.362 --> 58:31.161
So far, we have been unable to recall them.

58:35.603 --> 58:38.879
Are the planes being flown by crazy men?

58:38.963 --> 58:42.593
We're not sure.
It might be a mechanical failure.

58:42.684 --> 58:44.640
All I can tell you is that it's an accident.

58:44.724 --> 58:49.002
It's not an attempt to provoke war.
It's not part of a general attack.

58:51.805 --> 58:55.878
How do I know you do not have
hundreds of other planes

58:56.405 --> 58:59.442
coming in so low
our radar cannot pick them up?

59:00.085 --> 59:02.725
Because I hope to prove to you
that it's an accident.

59:02.806 --> 59:07.163
That we take full responsibility. That we're
doing everything we can to correct it.

59:09.006 --> 59:10.121
Go on.

59:10.206 --> 59:14.120
You must have seen that we sent
fighter planes to shoot down the bombers.

59:15.247 --> 59:18.717
American fighters
to shoot down American bombers?

59:18.807 --> 59:20.365
That is correct.

59:21.568 --> 59:24.002
- And you gave that order?
- I did.

59:26.247 --> 59:31.003
How do I know that the planes
were not simply diving to a low altitude

59:31.528 --> 59:32.643
to escape our radar?

59:32.728 --> 59:36.688
On our plotting board, the action could
only be interpreted as planes out of control.

59:36.769 --> 59:39.841
You have the same equipment we do.
What did it tell you?

59:41.810 --> 59:44.961
It did not tell us what is in your mind,
Mr President.

59:45.090 --> 59:46.682
I'm telling you that.

59:48.570 --> 59:51.607
- And you ask me to believe you?
- You must believe me.

59:52.850 --> 59:55.080
You ask for belief at a curious time.

59:55.491 --> 59:59.642
If we don't trust each other now,
Mr Chairman, there may not be another time.

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:06.047
We saw...
We saw your planes fall into the sea.

01:00:07.532 --> 01:00:10.763
I wanted only to hear your explanation.

01:00:11.532 --> 01:00:14.000
And whether it was done at your own order.

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:19.364
It is a hard thing
to order men to their death, is it not?

01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:20.647
It is.

01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:24.803
Sir,

01:00:25.294 --> 01:00:28.330
someone's trying to persuade him
it's a trick.

01:00:28.733 --> 01:00:30.963
They want him to strike back at once.

01:00:32.293 --> 01:00:36.173
Soviet airspace has still not been violated,
Mr President.

01:00:37.454 --> 01:00:40.686
But if it is, we will be forced
to shoot down your bombers.

01:00:41.135 --> 01:00:45.015
And then we will come to full alert
with all our missiles and planes.

01:00:45.096 --> 01:00:48.566
I understand that. I hope you're able
to shoot down our bombers.

01:00:49.576 --> 01:00:53.046
But I urge you not to take any steps
that cannot be recalled.

01:00:55.176 --> 01:00:57.087
You know we must protect ourselves.

01:00:57.176 --> 01:01:00.407
You also know that if you launch missiles,
we must do the same.

01:01:00.496 --> 01:01:03.853
If that happens,
there'll be very little left of the world.

01:01:05.817 --> 01:01:09.332
I understand.
Is there anything more you wish to say

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:11.454
If I may make a suggestion?

01:01:12.058 --> 01:01:14.128
I will arrange to open a conference line

01:01:14.218 --> 01:01:18.496
between our headquarters in Omaha and
your similar officials in the Soviet Union.

01:01:18.578 --> 01:01:20.649
We will do all we can to help you.

01:01:23.259 --> 01:01:27.651
We do not need your help. We are
perfectly capable of defending our country.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.415
As you wish, but I must tell you
what my people tell me.

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:33.531
No matter what you do,

01:01:33.619 --> 01:01:36.929
at least one of the planes will get through
to the target.

01:01:38.459 --> 01:01:40.848
- What is the target?
- Moscow.

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.618
I'll call you back
when I see what our fighters do.

01:02:40.065 --> 01:02:42.340
How's the formation holding, Sullivan?

01:02:42.945 --> 01:02:44.742
Everyone in line, sir.

01:02:44.985 --> 01:02:47.342
- How far from the border?
- Two minutes.

01:02:49.987 --> 01:02:51.898
We better start spreading out.

01:02:53.028 --> 01:02:54.905
Number Six plane in the lead.

01:02:55.868 --> 01:02:57.938
- Flynn.
- Right here, Colonel.

01:03:01.907 --> 01:03:04.102
- Go to work.
- Roger.

01:03:04.187 --> 01:03:06.622
Project the Soviet fighter planes.

01:03:07.308 --> 01:03:09.777
Give me tight scale on the Russian border.

01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:16.948
- That does it.
- They've crossed the border.

01:03:19.469 --> 01:03:21.937
Well, Buck, we're into Soviet territory.

01:03:25.909 --> 01:03:28.106
A technical state of war now exists.

01:03:33.311 --> 01:03:35.381
Give me Enemy Defense Performance.

01:03:35.551 --> 01:03:37.940
This is Enemy Defense Performance Desk,
General Bogan.

01:03:38.031 --> 01:03:39.066
How do you read the situation?

01:03:39.151 --> 01:03:41.870
Our Number Six plane carrying defensive
equipment and masking devices

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.020
has moved into the lead.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:45.545
All those new little blips you see
are decoys that it's dropped.

01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:47.270
Have the Russian fighters
launched any missiles yet?

01:03:47.352 --> 01:03:49.661
Not yet You'll see their missiles
on your scope as tiny dots

01:03:49.752 --> 01:03:52.745
that appear suddenly and then disappear.
There go some of them now.

01:03:53.113 --> 01:03:54.626
You can see they're confused by the decoys.

01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:57.546
They're still not grouping
where the real planes are.

01:03:57.633 --> 01:04:01.024
Can you wipe the decoys off the screen
so that we see just their planes and ours?

01:04:01.114 --> 01:04:02.751
There you are, General.

01:04:03.793 --> 01:04:06.785
They're still going after decoys.
Our boys aren't making it easy for them.

01:04:06.873 --> 01:04:07.943
Good.

01:04:08.914 --> 01:04:12.874
- They've picked up one of our planes now.
- Get them. Get them.

01:04:24.915 --> 01:04:26.951
Knock that off!

01:04:27.675 --> 01:04:30.474
This isn't some damn football game,
remember that!

01:04:31.676 --> 01:04:33.314
That plane's in trouble.

01:04:45.117 --> 01:04:47.472
It looks like the Soviets
have a very slow missile

01:04:47.557 --> 01:04:50.197
with a much longer range
than we thought they had.

01:04:50.278 --> 01:04:54.272
The slowness of speed made our missile
calculate they must be drones or decoys

01:04:54.359 --> 01:04:56.998
so it ignored them
and went after the fighters.

01:04:57.839 --> 01:05:00.751
We can compensate for that.
The adjustment is minor.

01:05:06.318 --> 01:05:08.309
The Premier is on the line, sir.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:11.992
Yes, Mr Chairman?

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.074
We have only a little time left, Mr President.

01:05:19.041 --> 01:05:20.872
His voice is different, sir.

01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:23.758
It's not angry. It's subdued.

01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:26.753
How shall we use this time?

01:05:28.001 --> 01:05:31.517
He sounds sorrowful, sad.

01:05:31.922 --> 01:05:34.038
What luck are your fighters having?

01:05:35.721 --> 01:05:38.316
Luck? No luck at all.

01:05:39.282 --> 01:05:41.318
We have shot down only one
of your bombers.

01:05:41.402 --> 01:05:43.394
Well, what about the other five?

01:05:44.683 --> 01:05:46.514
Maybe yes, maybe no.

01:05:48.243 --> 01:05:51.520
Your masking devices
are better than we had thought.

01:05:52.444 --> 01:05:55.436
Hundreds of targets have appeared
on the radar.

01:05:55.604 --> 01:05:58.517
Perhaps they are decoys.
Perhaps they are real bombers.

01:05:58.605 --> 01:06:01.961
Many of my experts
are convinced that they are real.

01:06:02.685 --> 01:06:04.915
They urge me to release our own bombers
at once.

01:06:05.245 --> 01:06:06.996
Why don't you, then?

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:10.403
- Good question.
- Why haven't you counterattacked?

01:06:11.765 --> 01:06:14.154
I am gambling that you are sincere.

01:06:15.285 --> 01:06:18.517
My generals are not so happy with me
about this,

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:22.116
as I'm sure your generals are not so happy
with you.

01:06:22.207 --> 01:06:24.675
But there is time for common sense.

01:06:26.287 --> 01:06:30.200
I must have proof, Mr President.
Neither of us wants war

01:06:30.687 --> 01:06:35.079
but we must be convinced
that this is truly a mistake,

01:06:35.168 --> 01:06:38.284
that your intentions are not hostile
and that there is a chance for peace.

01:06:38.367 --> 01:06:41.041
Mr Chairman, let me ask you something.

01:06:41.608 --> 01:06:44.918
Just before our planes took off
from their fail-safe point,

01:06:45.008 --> 01:06:48.000
there was a white flash
on our plotting board.

01:06:48.408 --> 01:06:51.525
We think this is connected
to some mechanical failure

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.043
that might have activated their "go" signal.

01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:56.440
Could this have been caused
by your radio interference?

01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.284
They're arguing with him again, sir,

01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:03.169
telling him not to answer,
the information is too secret.

01:07:03.251 --> 01:07:06.766
Was it your jamming that kept us
from getting through to our planes?

01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:11.326
I do not know about this jamming.

01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:12.806
I think he does.

01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:16.844
We cannot be responsible
for your mechanical failures.

01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:18.922
Is it possible? Could it have happened?

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.689
You ask for proof, Mr Chairman.
This could be it.

01:07:28.493 --> 01:07:30.768
They're arguing back and forth.

01:07:30.853 --> 01:07:32.332
"Don't trust you."

01:07:32.974 --> 01:07:34.771
"Have to trust you."

01:07:35.014 --> 01:07:36.527
"It's a trick."

01:07:36.814 --> 01:07:39.327
We're paying for our mutual suspicions,
Mr Chairman,

01:07:39.413 --> 01:07:41.768
I realize that, but the wall must be broken.

01:07:41.853 --> 01:07:45.164
We have to break it down now.
We can't afford not to trust each other.

01:07:48.934 --> 01:07:52.324
We jammed your radios
with a special device

01:07:53.215 --> 01:07:55.285
even I did not know about.

01:07:55.735 --> 01:07:58.886
I suppose I must be very proud
of our scientists.

01:07:59.655 --> 01:08:02.295
It was more effective than anyone dreamed.

01:08:02.376 --> 01:08:04.128
But why? Why this time?

01:08:05.416 --> 01:08:07.772
We have computers, like yours.

01:08:08.776 --> 01:08:12.371
They computed that this time
your alert might be real.

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:14.449
On what grounds?

01:08:16.377 --> 01:08:18.765
Probability. The law of averages.

01:08:20.337 --> 01:08:21.689
They have their own logic.

01:08:21.777 --> 01:08:26.328
It is not human, but it is positive,
so we listen.

01:08:26.617 --> 01:08:30.497
Will you lift the jamming
so I can talk to the group commander?

01:08:31.218 --> 01:08:34.371
- Will he return on your command?
- There's a chance.

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:36.692
I'll give that order.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.095
General Bogan.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.768
Yes, Mr President.

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:43.169
- Put me through to Group Six, fast.
- Right away, sir.

01:08:43.459 --> 01:08:46.019
- What's the group commander's name?
- Colonel Jack Grady, sir.

01:08:46.099 --> 01:08:48.294
- Does he have a wife?
- I'll see, sir.

01:08:48.379 --> 01:08:50.974
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.
Can you hear me?

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:53.698
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.
Can you hear me?

01:08:53.779 --> 01:08:55.692
- Yes, sir, he does.
- Find her.

01:08:55.781 --> 01:08:57.372
If I can't persuade him, maybe she can.

01:08:57.461 --> 01:08:59.019
- Yes, sir.
- Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.295
Can you hear me?

01:09:00.381 --> 01:09:02.258
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One,
can you hear me?

01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:05.094
I have an important message.
Turkey One, can you hear me?

01:09:08.942 --> 01:09:11.058
Turkey One, can you hear me?

01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:13.861
Turkey One, can you hear me?
This is Ultimate One. Can you hear me?

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:16.013
They've stopped jamming us.

01:09:16.343 --> 01:09:19.493
This is Turkey One. Turkey One,
I am not authorized to receive messages.

01:09:19.983 --> 01:09:23.692
Colonel Grady,
this is the President of the United States.

01:09:23.823 --> 01:09:27.736
The mission you are flying has been
triggered by a mechanical failure.

01:09:27.823 --> 01:09:30.656
It is a mistake.
I order you and the other planes

01:09:30.743 --> 01:09:32.974
to return to your base at once.

01:09:33.064 --> 01:09:34.497
Do you hear? At once!

01:09:36.785 --> 01:09:39.345
Colonel Grady, I repeat.
This is the President.

01:09:39.425 --> 01:09:42.018
I can no longer receive tactical alterations
by voice.

01:09:42.104 --> 01:09:43.174
I know that, but...

01:09:43.265 --> 01:09:45.654
What you're telling me,
I've been specifically ordered not to do!

01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:47.462
Damn it, Grady, this is the President!

01:10:00.147 --> 01:10:01.899
He's still on, sir.

01:10:11.347 --> 01:10:16.102
Mr Chairman, I think it would be wise
for you to remove yourself from Moscow

01:10:16.187 --> 01:10:18.464
so that you'll be out of danger.

01:10:18.789 --> 01:10:22.941
It will allow us to continue negotiations
even if the worst happens.

01:10:24.869 --> 01:10:28.259
I have made those arrangements.
His voice is tougher.

01:10:30.989 --> 01:10:33.981
Unfortunately, we cannot remove Moscow.

01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:39.825
It remains here, open to your bombs,
and when it is destroyed,

01:10:40.711 --> 01:10:44.339
its people dead because there's no time
to evacuate them,

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:47.103
where shall we negotiate, Mr President?

01:10:47.190 --> 01:10:50.979
Shall I come to Geneva, hat in hand,
begging for peace?

01:10:51.071 --> 01:10:52.743
I offered you help. You refused it.

01:10:52.831 --> 01:10:55.504
I offer it again.
We will help you shoot down the planes.

01:10:58.753 --> 01:11:00.232
Set up your conference line.

01:11:00.313 --> 01:11:03.385
I'll come back on the phone
when I'm a safe distance from Moscow.

01:11:04.473 --> 01:11:08.386
Will you activate the Ultimate One/Red One
Touch Phone, please.

01:11:10.793 --> 01:11:12.624
Can we stop them, sir?

01:11:29.555 --> 01:11:34.026
Fire. Fire.
Before he gets off one of those slow ones.

01:11:34.355 --> 01:11:38.428
Colonel, knock that off,
or I'll have you taken out of this room.

01:11:48.676 --> 01:11:51.395
Two down. Four to go.

01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:09.991
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

01:12:10.079 --> 01:12:12.593
Every minute we wait works against us.

01:12:12.679 --> 01:12:16.956
Now, Mr Secretary.
Now is when we must send in a first strike.

01:12:17.478 --> 01:12:21.916
We don't go in for sneak attacks.
We had that done to us at Pearl Harbor.

01:12:21.999 --> 01:12:24.309
And the Japanese were right to do it.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.354
From their point of view,
we were their mortal enemy.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.238
As long as we existed,
we were a deadly threat to them.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:34.438
Their only mistake was
that they failed to finish us at the start

01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:36.352
and they paid for that mistake at Hiroshima.

01:12:36.441 --> 01:12:39.717
- You're talking about a different kind of war.
- Exactly.

01:12:39.801 --> 01:12:42.362
This time, we can finish what we start.

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:45.957
And if we act now, right now,
our casualties will be minimal.

01:12:46.042 --> 01:12:47.839
Do you know what you're saying?

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:55.394
Do you believe
that Communism is not our mortal enemy?

01:12:55.482 --> 01:12:57.518
You're justifying murder.

01:12:57.722 --> 01:13:00.681
Yes, to keep from being murdered.

01:13:00.963 --> 01:13:03.523
In the name of what? To preserve what?

01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:07.924
Even if we do survive, what are we,
better than what we say they are?

01:13:08.005 --> 01:13:09.802
What gives us the right to live, then?

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.001
What makes us worth surviving,
Groeteschele?

01:13:12.085 --> 01:13:15.441
- That we are ruthless enough to strike first?
- Yes!

01:13:16.044 --> 01:13:20.515
Those who can survive
are the only ones worth surviving.

01:13:20.684 --> 01:13:22.403
Fighting for your life
isn't the same as murder.

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:25.124
Where do you draw the line
once you know what the enemy is?

01:13:25.485 --> 01:13:27.636
How long would the Nazis have kept it up,
General,

01:13:27.726 --> 01:13:30.365
if every Jew they came after
had met them with a gun in his hand?

01:13:30.446 --> 01:13:33.961
But I learnt from them, General Black.
Oh, I learnt.

01:13:34.606 --> 01:13:36.756
You learnt too well, Professor.

01:13:37.126 --> 01:13:38.445
You learnt so well

01:13:38.526 --> 01:13:42.646
that now there's no difference
between you and what you want to kill.

01:14:04.009 --> 01:14:05.647
Yes, Mr President

01:14:06.769 --> 01:14:09.203
Contact our ambassador to Moscow.

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:13.167
Also the Soviet delegate
to the United Nations.

01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:15.481
Hook them onto my line.

01:14:16.371 --> 01:14:18.326
When the Soviet Premier comes back
on the phone,

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:20.321
put us all on together.

01:14:20.410 --> 01:14:22.002
Yes, Mr President

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:25.885
Is the Touch Phone open between Omaha
and the Soviet command headquarters?

01:14:25.971 --> 01:14:28.485
- Yes, sir, all ready.
- Keep it open.

01:14:41.372 --> 01:14:42.805
General Black.

01:14:43.893 --> 01:14:45.611
Yes, Mr President.

01:14:46.053 --> 01:14:47.247
Blackie,

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:51.963
- remember your Old Testament?
- A little.

01:14:54.094 --> 01:14:56.085
Remember the story of the sacrifice
of Abraham?

01:14:56.174 --> 01:14:59.052
Old what's-his-name used to use it
in chapel

01:14:59.134 --> 01:15:00.965
at least twice a year.

01:15:03.094 --> 01:15:04.244
I remember, sir.

01:15:05.255 --> 01:15:09.168
Keep it in mind the next few hours.
Blackie, I need your help.

01:15:10.855 --> 01:15:14.974
Get out to Andrews Field right away.
Orders will be waiting for you there.

01:15:15.096 --> 01:15:16.370
Yes, sir.

01:15:17.456 --> 01:15:19.844
Blackie, are Katherine and the kids
in New York?

01:15:22.055 --> 01:15:23.204
Yes, sir.

01:15:24.697 --> 01:15:27.257
I may be asking a great deal of you.

01:15:30.337 --> 01:15:32.248
I'll do whatever you say.

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:37.895
Good luck, Blackie.

01:15:38.898 --> 01:15:41.537
- General Bogan.
- Yes, Mr President?

01:15:42.058 --> 01:15:44.572
I've activated the Touch Phone
between you and the Soviet command.

01:15:44.659 --> 01:15:47.173
- Will you test it, please?
- Yes, sir.

01:16:18.262 --> 01:16:21.617
This is General Bogan,
Strategic Air Command, Omaha.

01:16:22.101 --> 01:16:24.410
I am the translator for Marshal Nevsky.

01:16:25.702 --> 01:16:27.693
Marshal Nevsky sends his greetings.

01:16:29.542 --> 01:16:30.770
The same to him.

01:16:30.862 --> 01:16:33.935
Our reception is five-by-five.
How do you read us?

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:36.014
We read you five-by-five.

01:16:36.103 --> 01:16:38.742
One moment, please.
Mr President, we're through to them.

01:16:38.823 --> 01:16:39.893
Thank you, General.

01:16:39.984 --> 01:16:43.101
Will you put me on your public address
system so everyone can hear what I say

01:16:43.184 --> 01:16:45.061
I want the Russians to be able to hear
as well.

01:16:45.144 --> 01:16:46.419
Yes, sir.

01:16:46.905 --> 01:16:48.258
Ready, sir.

01:16:54.184 --> 01:16:57.540
Gentlemen,
this is the President of the United States.

01:16:58.664 --> 01:17:01.543
Whatever orders I give
to American personnel

01:17:02.585 --> 01:17:06.373
are to be considered direct orders
from the Commander in Chief.

01:17:06.585 --> 01:17:11.502
They are to be obeyed fully,
without reservation and at once.

01:17:13.227 --> 01:17:17.743
We must do everything we can to prevent
our planes from attacking Moscow.

01:17:19.387 --> 01:17:24.063
The Soviet Premier has behaved as I believe
I would under similar conditions.

01:17:25.027 --> 01:17:26.745
He has delayed retaliation.

01:17:26.827 --> 01:17:29.581
I think he believes this is an accident.

01:17:29.788 --> 01:17:34.179
But we must convince him
and his chief advisors that it is.

01:17:35.588 --> 01:17:37.897
I therefore order every American

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:41.622
to cooperate fully with Soviet officers

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:45.503
in shooting down our invading planes.

01:17:47.791 --> 01:17:50.988
You are to give whatever information
they request

01:17:51.631 --> 01:17:55.509
Any hesitation,
any withholding of information

01:17:56.670 --> 01:17:59.264
can have the most tragic consequences.

01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:02.629
I cannot emphasize this too strongly.

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:06.267
Are there any questions?

01:18:08.472 --> 01:18:12.021
Gentlemen, I expect you to conduct
yourselves as patriots.

01:18:14.152 --> 01:18:16.064
And I wish you success.

01:18:22.353 --> 01:18:27.143
Do the missiles on these bombers have both
infrared and radar homing capabilities?

01:18:27.233 --> 01:18:29.668
A number of our fighter planes
have been destroyed

01:18:29.754 --> 01:18:33.269
by a missile that seems to home
not on the infrared source,

01:18:33.354 --> 01:18:35.390
but on the radar transmitter. Is it possible?

01:18:35.474 --> 01:18:38.272
Colonel Cascio will answer your question.

01:18:39.594 --> 01:18:41.789
Answer the question, Colonel.

01:18:43.194 --> 01:18:46.391
That is a direct order. An order, Colonel!

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:49.791
Colonel!

01:18:51.757 --> 01:18:54.225
Just a moment, please. Major Handel.

01:18:57.556 --> 01:18:59.035
General Bogan.

01:18:59.876 --> 01:19:02.231
Sergeant Collins, on the double!

01:19:04.796 --> 01:19:06.434
You're backup man on fire control,
aren't you?

01:19:06.516 --> 01:19:07.585
Yes, sir.

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:12.115
Do our Vindicator missiles have
both infrared- and radar-seeking capacity?

01:19:13.118 --> 01:19:14.346
Yes, sir.

01:19:14.518 --> 01:19:17.954
Loud and clear!
They've got to know we're on the level!

01:19:19.478 --> 01:19:21.673
It has both capacities, sir.

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:23.877
Can the radar-seeking mechanism
be overloaded

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.711
by increasing the strength of the signal?

01:19:27.038 --> 01:19:28.391
Tell them!

01:19:29.358 --> 01:19:30.634
Yes, sir.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.432
It can be overloaded

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:36.557
by increasing the power output

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.315
and sliding through radar frequencies
as fast as possible,

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.671
what happens is the firing mechanism

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.036
reads the higher amperage
as proximity to the target

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.716
and detonates the warhead.

01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:55.277
Thank you, General Bogan.
We will be back to you.

01:19:56.921 --> 01:19:58.719
That's all, Sergeant.

01:20:14.524 --> 01:20:16.196
What does it mean?

01:20:16.684 --> 01:20:19.596
We've told them how to blow up
our air-to-air missiles

01:20:20.404 --> 01:20:24.079
and with them our planes.

01:20:32.205 --> 01:20:34.117
They're picking us up.

01:20:35.086 --> 01:20:38.203
Thomas, send out the code
for the alternate flight plan.

01:20:38.286 --> 01:20:40.516
We're going down to the floor.

01:20:57.527 --> 01:21:01.759
They're trying to avoid the fighters
by going too low for their radar.

01:21:05.807 --> 01:21:09.403
I'm sorry, General, I...
I don't know what happened. I just...

01:21:09.768 --> 01:21:12.566
I just couldn't do it. It was like a...
I don't know, a fit or something.

01:21:12.648 --> 01:21:14.048
Colonel, I...

01:21:15.769 --> 01:21:17.089
Forget it.

01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:22.163
Who could have expected this situation?

01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:24.521
General. General, I...

01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:27.366
I think this is all a trap.

01:21:28.809 --> 01:21:30.845
They wanted this to happen.

01:21:32.009 --> 01:21:35.764
We know they've been trying to foul up
our fail-safe signal.

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:39.639
I think that we should tell the President
it's a trap.

01:21:40.412 --> 01:21:42.607
They're just using the time
to get their missiles ready

01:21:42.692 --> 01:21:44.523
and fly their bombers into position.

01:21:44.612 --> 01:21:46.523
We have no evidence of that.

01:21:46.612 --> 01:21:49.604
They could be flying their bombers
in the grass.

01:21:49.692 --> 01:21:51.125
They could have fired missiles already

01:21:51.212 --> 01:21:52.930
and put them up in the orbit
of known satellites

01:21:53.012 --> 01:21:54.082
where we couldn't detect them.

01:21:54.173 --> 01:21:55.288
Remember. We computed that problem.

01:21:55.373 --> 01:21:58.331
We decided satellites could be used
to mask missiles.

01:21:58.413 --> 01:22:00.051
We computed a lot of problems.

01:22:00.133 --> 01:22:03.284
I'm not reporting anything
I don't know for sure.

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:06.409
I think we should recommend
a full-strength attack.

01:22:06.493 --> 01:22:08.484
That is not our decision! The Pentagon...

01:22:08.573 --> 01:22:11.326
They don't know what we know.
They're not soldiers anymore.

01:22:11.413 --> 01:22:15.203
They're politicians.
They don't care what happens to us.

01:22:16.575 --> 01:22:19.169
They make a mistake, that's politics.

01:22:19.415 --> 01:22:22.214
They send out men to be killed, General.
For what?

01:22:22.936 --> 01:22:25.689
To make some lousy deal, to sell us out.

01:22:26.736 --> 01:22:28.772
Save the world, save us.

01:22:29.096 --> 01:22:33.452
Save our country before they destroy it
with their stinking politics.

01:22:34.535 --> 01:22:37.926
Order a first strike, General.
Put an end to it once and for all.

01:22:38.016 --> 01:22:40.928
- You have the power. You can do it!
- Colonel!

01:22:41.937 --> 01:22:45.896
You are talking treason. Stop it now,
or I'll have you put under arrest.

01:22:46.977 --> 01:22:49.367
General Bogan, this is Marshal Nevsky.

01:22:49.458 --> 01:22:50.527
Yes, Marshal.

01:22:50.618 --> 01:22:53.849
Can you give us the longitude and latitude
of the three planes left in the air?

01:22:53.938 --> 01:22:55.770
We can do that,
but we can't give you their altitude.

01:22:55.859 --> 01:22:57.577
The signals we're getting now
are too distorted.

01:22:57.659 --> 01:23:00.253
Will you please give us the position
of the three planes?

01:23:00.338 --> 01:23:02.408
We can fly fighters at various altitudes.

01:23:02.498 --> 01:23:03.727
Can do.

01:23:05.699 --> 01:23:07.849
Gentlemen, I am taking over command
of this post

01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:10.453
at the specific order
of the President of the United States.

01:23:10.539 --> 01:23:12.894
He has long been aware
that General Bogan is mentally unbalanced

01:23:12.979 --> 01:23:14.970
and has warned me to observe him closely.

01:23:15.059 --> 01:23:17.779
The negotiations which General Bogan
has been conducting with the enemy

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.373
are the acts of a lunatic.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.939
By the direct authority of the President,

01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:23.455
I now command you to take
all orders from...

01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:26.534
Colonel? We got orders, Colonel.

01:23:26.622 --> 01:23:28.897
You make a fuss, we'll kill you.

01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:33.339
You're a traitor. You're worse than anybody.

01:23:33.461 --> 01:23:35.656
You wear the uniform.
You have men under your command.

01:23:35.741 --> 01:23:39.052
You're in the field, but you want them dead
before they find you out!

01:23:39.142 --> 01:23:41.019
You want me dead!

01:23:41.102 --> 01:23:44.731
I saw it this morning when you found me
with those people.

01:23:46.183 --> 01:23:48.378
I'm better than you are!

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.501
It's a mistake.

01:23:52.943 --> 01:23:56.824
You're betraying us all!
You're making a mistake!

01:23:57.505 --> 01:24:00.258
I'm better than you are. You're a traitor.

01:24:00.385 --> 01:24:02.659
You're betraying us all!

01:24:13.305 --> 01:24:15.261
- Marshal Nevsky?
- Yes, sir.

01:24:16.745 --> 01:24:19.055
I am now prepared to give you
the longitude and latitude

01:24:19.146 --> 01:24:21.216
of our bombers in accordance
with your request.

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:23.900
I was aware of your difficulty,
General Bogan.

01:24:23.986 --> 01:24:27.376
We have had such problems ourselves.
I await your information.

01:24:27.466 --> 01:24:28.900
Major Handel.

01:24:40.428 --> 01:24:43.818
- General, you better have a doctor...
- They've got another one.

01:24:45.948 --> 01:24:48.587
Sit down, anyway. That was a bad knock.

01:24:51.589 --> 01:24:53.978
Anyone could crack under the strain.

01:24:54.069 --> 01:24:56.139
Well, if you ask me,
he was a boy on the edge...

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:58.060
He was a good soldier.

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:09.705
The Soviet Premier is coming back
on the line, sir.

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:11.907
The ambassador and the Soviet delegate
are already on.

01:25:11.991 --> 01:25:14.346
- Have they been told?
- Yes, sir, as you said.

01:25:14.431 --> 01:25:15.546
Good.

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:18.590
Jay, where are you?

01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:20.902
On the top floor of the embassy in Moscow,
Mr President

01:25:20.992 --> 01:25:24.667
- Where are you, Mr Lentov?
- In the UN building in New York.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:29.386
I suppose there is a reason

01:25:29.712 --> 01:25:32.830
for your ambassador
and Comrade Lentov to join us.

01:25:32.913 --> 01:25:34.664
There is, Mr Chairman.

01:25:36.472 --> 01:25:38.428
Then let's get on with it.

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:43.022
His voice is firmer, sir. Final.

01:25:43.114 --> 01:25:45.184
Like he's made up his mind.

01:25:46.634 --> 01:25:49.785
In a few minutes, the bombs may be falling.

01:25:51.994 --> 01:25:55.624
I have brought our forces
to a condition of full readiness.

01:25:57.275 --> 01:26:01.064
Unless we can satisfy one another,
I must release those forces.

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.431
So, what do you propose, Mr President?

01:26:03.516 --> 01:26:07.986
Do your people think there is still a chance
of bringing down the bombers?

01:26:09.235 --> 01:26:11.305
There is always a chance.

01:26:12.195 --> 01:26:14.994
But I'm asking you, what if they cannot?

01:26:16.557 --> 01:26:19.947
What will you do?
Have you made a decision?

01:26:20.518 --> 01:26:21.553
Yes.

01:26:22.998 --> 01:26:26.308
It's my decision
and I take full responsibility.

01:26:28.038 --> 01:26:31.428
- Mr Swenson, are you on the line?
- Yes, Mr President.

01:26:31.598 --> 01:26:33.668
- General Bogan?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:39.517
This is what will happen
if even one of the bombers gets through.

01:26:39.838 --> 01:26:43.878
It will drop two 20-megaton bombs
on Moscow.

01:26:44.639 --> 01:26:46.789
- Jay
- Yes, Mr President?

01:26:46.879 --> 01:26:50.873
You might hear the sound of the engines
just before the bombs drop, maybe not.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.350
In any case,
you'll hear the defensive missiles going off.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.273
Right after that, the bombs will explode.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.917
I'm told that what we will hear at this end
will be a high, shrill sound.

01:27:04.042 --> 01:27:08.557
That will be the ambassador's phone
melting from the heat of the fireball.

01:27:09.321 --> 01:27:11.312
When we hear that sound,

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:15.111
the ambassador will be dead.

01:27:16.001 --> 01:27:19.790
You understand, Mr Ambassador,
you're to stay exactly where you are.

01:27:19.882 --> 01:27:21.520
Yes, Mr President

01:27:22.084 --> 01:27:23.597
He's got to attack.

01:27:25.164 --> 01:27:26.961
Is this your proposal?

01:27:28.044 --> 01:27:31.002
To sacrifice one American
for five million Russians?

01:27:31.084 --> 01:27:33.439
No, no, no. Listen to me! Listen!

01:27:35.284 --> 01:27:38.878
I've ordered a Vindicator bomber into the air
from Washington.

01:27:38.963 --> 01:27:42.161
In a few minutes,
it will be flying over New York City.

01:27:42.245 --> 01:27:44.964
It is carrying two 20-megaton bombs.

01:27:46.205 --> 01:27:49.003
The moment I know
that Moscow has been hit,

01:27:49.885 --> 01:27:52.683
I will order that plane to drop its bombs.

01:27:52.845 --> 01:27:56.282
It will use the Empire State Building
for ground zero.

01:27:56.926 --> 01:28:00.282
When we hear the shriek
of Mr Lentov's phone melting,

01:28:02.647 --> 01:28:06.527
we will know that he is gone
and with him, New York.

01:28:09.887 --> 01:28:11.479
Holy Mother of God.

01:28:11.567 --> 01:28:12.682
No.

01:28:15.567 --> 01:28:17.080
He can't do it.

01:28:18.407 --> 01:28:20.125
What else can he do?

01:28:22.887 --> 01:28:26.120
I don't know any other way,
Mr Chairman, unless...

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:30.403
Unless you feel the offer itself is enough.

01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:32.323
Showing our intentions.

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:36.846
Would you think it enough?

01:28:38.010 --> 01:28:41.365
If Russian bombers were flying
against New York,

01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:46.605
could you accept only my good intentions?

01:28:47.971 --> 01:28:49.040
No.

01:28:50.531 --> 01:28:52.806
I believe this was an accident.

01:28:54.531 --> 01:28:58.444
But I also believe your action
is the only way out.

01:29:00.891 --> 01:29:03.883
I ask you to believe I wish it were not so.

01:29:05.493 --> 01:29:06.563
Yes.

01:29:07.854 --> 01:29:11.402
Well, we can still hope
I won't have to take that action.

01:29:35.335 --> 01:29:37.007
How close to target?

01:29:38.095 --> 01:29:39.575
Fourteen minutes, sir.

01:29:39.656 --> 01:29:41.452
How many planes left?

01:29:41.575 --> 01:29:43.486
Just us and Number Six.

01:29:47.656 --> 01:29:50.251
- Flynn.
- Still here, Grady.

01:29:50.617 --> 01:29:52.016
What's your condition?

01:29:52.777 --> 01:29:55.007
Slight wing damage from ordinary flak.
That's all.

01:29:55.097 --> 01:29:57.327
Speed down to 1,350. Drag even.

01:29:57.897 --> 01:30:01.856
- How many of the decoys do you have left?
- How many do you need?

01:30:02.297 --> 01:30:04.288
Well, I got the bombs. You don't.

01:30:04.377 --> 01:30:07.211
I want you to take some of those fighters
off my tail.

01:30:07.298 --> 01:30:08.526
Will do.

01:30:08.618 --> 01:30:10.176
- Billy?
- Yeah?

01:30:10.978 --> 01:30:12.491
I depend on you.

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:20.168
General Bogan,
can you explain this manoeuvre?

01:30:20.259 --> 01:30:22.170
One of your planes has just appeared again.

01:30:22.259 --> 01:30:24.215
It's standard procedure, Marshal Nevsky.

01:30:24.299 --> 01:30:26.096
That's our Number Six plane,
the decoy plane.

01:30:26.179 --> 01:30:30.093
It's just trying to draw your fighters away
from our other plane carrying the bombs.

01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:31.295
I see.

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:34.857
It carries only defensive equipment.
You don't have to worry about it.

01:30:34.941 --> 01:30:37.978
Thank you.
We shall try for a kill in any case.

01:30:38.701 --> 01:30:42.773
She'll scatter your forces, Marshal.
You don't have time for that.

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:48.613
I tell you, it doesn't carry any bombs.
You don't have to worry about it!

01:30:50.822 --> 01:30:53.621
You're letting our other plane get through!

01:30:58.623 --> 01:30:59.942
I told you!

01:31:02.863 --> 01:31:04.535
There has been a...

01:31:05.063 --> 01:31:07.259
Marshal Nevsky has collapsed.

01:31:08.664 --> 01:31:11.132
It appears... Well, I don't know.

01:31:12.224 --> 01:31:14.579
General Koniev is now in command.

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:17.501
Bogan, what's happened?

01:31:17.584 --> 01:31:21.817
Marshal Nevsky sent his fighters
after a plane that carried no bombs.

01:31:22.345 --> 01:31:26.224
That means our Number One plane
will almost certainly get through.

01:31:26.305 --> 01:31:29.184
The marshal realized that
It was too much for him.

01:31:29.306 --> 01:31:31.774
General Bogan, this is General Koniev.

01:31:31.866 --> 01:31:33.743
Do you have the remaining plane
on your screen?

01:31:33.826 --> 01:31:35.259
No, sir, we do not.

01:31:35.346 --> 01:31:37.736
We cannot see it on our radar,
and it is flying so fast,

01:31:37.827 --> 01:31:39.818
our antiaircraft is useless.

01:31:39.907 --> 01:31:42.546
- I must assume the plane will get through.
- Yes.

01:31:42.627 --> 01:31:46.699
I intend to focus all our remaining rockets
on the estimated path of the plane

01:31:46.786 --> 01:31:48.539
and fire them all off at once.

01:31:48.627 --> 01:31:51.664
Our hope is to set up
a thermonuclear barrier

01:31:51.747 --> 01:31:53.738
that nothing can penetrate.

01:31:53.867 --> 01:31:56.507
That might work. It's wor'th a chance.

01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:09.869
You speak English very well, General.

01:32:10.230 --> 01:32:14.063
I was liaison to your headquarters
in London during the war.

01:32:14.909 --> 01:32:17.469
I was stationed right outside of London.

01:32:17.549 --> 01:32:20.144
Yes, I know. With the 8th Air Force.

01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:22.982
Did you like London?

01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:25.269
Very much.

01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:29.391
So did I.

01:32:30.272 --> 01:32:33.230
The great cities are those
where one can walk.

01:32:34.272 --> 01:32:38.948
I would walk all the time in London.
Wherever you turn, there's history.

01:32:40.553 --> 01:32:43.704
- General, are you in Moscow now?
- No.

01:32:44.952 --> 01:32:46.863
I was ordered to leave.

01:32:47.472 --> 01:32:48.871
Is your...

01:32:54.193 --> 01:32:55.785
It's a hard day.

01:32:57.993 --> 01:32:59.585
Yes, a hard day.

01:33:01.394 --> 01:33:03.146
Goodbye, my friend.

01:33:04.875 --> 01:33:06.627
Goodbye, my friend.

01:33:09.435 --> 01:33:11.506
- Colonel Grady, sir.
- What is it, Thomas?

01:33:11.596 --> 01:33:12.665
The infrared indicator

01:33:12.756 --> 01:33:15.316
shows a large number
of ground-to-air rockets ignited ahead of us.

01:33:15.395 --> 01:33:17.147
They should show on the scope
anytime now.

01:33:17.235 --> 01:33:19.146
What do you know about those rockets?

01:33:19.235 --> 01:33:20.748
They're no different from ours, sir.

01:33:20.835 --> 01:33:22.713
Designed to home in
on heat-producing engines,

01:33:22.796 --> 01:33:24.388
like an aeroplane.

01:33:25.436 --> 01:33:28.394
They can't be aiming them at us.
We're too low. They'd blow themselves up.

01:33:28.476 --> 01:33:30.626
What are they doing with them?

01:33:31.397 --> 01:33:32.671
- General Bogan?
- Yes.

01:33:32.757 --> 01:33:35.191
They found Mrs Grady. She's standing by.

01:33:35.277 --> 01:33:37.347
Mr President, we have Grady's wife.

01:33:37.437 --> 01:33:38.632
Can we get through to him?

01:33:38.718 --> 01:33:41.869
If he follows procedure, he'll contact us
when he gets within range of the target.

01:33:41.958 --> 01:33:44.268
Those are his orders so that
we know how to evaluate the strike.

01:33:44.359 --> 01:33:47.395
- Well, he's been following orders so far.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:47.478 --> 01:33:49.514
Keep your fingers crossed.

01:33:49.598 --> 01:33:51.237
- Thomas.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:52.079 --> 01:33:54.195
Would their rockets follow missiles, too?

01:33:54.279 --> 01:33:56.952
I don't see why not.
A missile produces heat.

01:33:57.039 --> 01:33:58.757
So I think I know what they're gonna do.

01:33:58.839 --> 01:34:02.229
Explode the rockets on top of us,
hope to knock us down with a blast.

01:34:02.319 --> 01:34:05.038
They can do it, too. But how many
air-to-air missiles we got left?

01:34:05.119 --> 01:34:06.439
- Two.
- Okay.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.318
Now, the minute you see those rockets
ignite on the scope,

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.519
you fire our missiles and guide them
for maximum elevation straight up.

01:34:12.602 --> 01:34:13.671
- Straight up?
- Yeah.

01:34:13.762 --> 01:34:17.595
Maybe their rockets will follow the missiles,
explode too high to hurt us.

01:34:17.681 --> 01:34:19.000
Yes, sir.

01:34:19.961 --> 01:34:22.521
Colonel Grady, we're in range.
We have to report in.

01:34:23.081 --> 01:34:24.719
Watch that scope.

01:34:26.081 --> 01:34:28.391
Ultimate One, this is Turkey One.
Ultimate One, this is Turkey One.

01:34:28.482 --> 01:34:30.791
- Can you hear me?
- Grady, this is General Bogan.

01:34:30.882 --> 01:34:34.353
Keep receiving no matter what you hear.
Do you understand? Keep receiving.

01:34:34.443 --> 01:34:35.592
Jack.

01:34:36.523 --> 01:34:38.275
Jack, this is Helen.

01:34:38.643 --> 01:34:41.077
Jack, it's Helen. Do you recognize my voice?

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:44.232
It's not a trick. It's me.

01:34:44.683 --> 01:34:49.314
Jack, you must turn back.
You mustn't drop those bombs.

01:34:49.404 --> 01:34:52.237
- Do you hear me?
- Is it really your wife?

01:34:52.404 --> 01:34:54.441
They've started their rockets.

01:34:54.525 --> 01:34:56.083
- Fire one.
- Jack.

01:34:56.685 --> 01:34:58.721
Do you hear what I'm saying? Jack!

01:34:58.805 --> 01:35:00.158
Fire two.

01:35:02.525 --> 01:35:04.720
Keep them at least 2,500 feet
above the rockets.

01:35:04.805 --> 01:35:06.477
- Yes, sir.
- Jack.

01:35:07.445 --> 01:35:10.404
There's no war! We're fine!

01:35:11.686 --> 01:35:13.359
You must turn back!

01:35:14.407 --> 01:35:15.886
They're at 18,000.

01:35:15.967 --> 01:35:17.639
- Go! Go!
- 19,000.

01:35:17.727 --> 01:35:18.920
This is not a trick.

01:35:19.006 --> 01:35:21.077
- 20,000 feet.
- The rockets are following them!

01:35:21.167 --> 01:35:23.237
Give them as much boost as you can.
The higher, the better.

01:35:23.327 --> 01:35:25.238
- I've never lied to you, have I?
- 40,000.

01:35:25.327 --> 01:35:26.396
50,000.

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:28.557
I couldn't, no matter what
anybody did to me, I wouldn't.

01:35:28.647 --> 01:35:30.160
- Please. You've got to believe me!
- 70,000.

01:35:30.247 --> 01:35:31.681
80,000 feet.

01:35:31.968 --> 01:35:34.164
- 90,000. 100,000.
- Jack, there is no war.

01:35:34.249 --> 01:35:37.047
- They're slowing down.
- 130,000.

01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:38.198
140,000.

01:35:38.289 --> 01:35:41.247
- We'd better get some altitude.
- Jack, please, answer me, please!

01:35:41.329 --> 01:35:43.047
- Answer me!
- 170,000.

01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:44.562
Jack, do you...

01:35:44.649 --> 01:35:47.083
Answer me, please!

01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:49.881
You can't trust it, sir!
We gotta get out of here!

01:35:50.888 --> 01:35:51.957
No!

01:35:54.571 --> 01:35:55.720
Hang on!

01:35:58.531 --> 01:36:00.010
Their rockets are catching up!

01:36:00.091 --> 01:36:02.924
We're gonna catch some of it.
So hold tight.

01:36:03.211 --> 01:36:04.644
There they go.

01:36:14.012 --> 01:36:16.004
Think we'll make it now.

01:36:18.133 --> 01:36:20.168
How many minutes to Moscow?

01:36:20.492 --> 01:36:22.130
Seven minutes, sir.

01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:23.880
Look...

01:36:24.572 --> 01:36:28.121
We have our choice
about what altitude to drop the bombs from.

01:36:28.252 --> 01:36:31.086
It's about the only choice we do have now.

01:36:31.813 --> 01:36:36.650
Blast gave us enough radiation.
At best we'd only last a couple of days.

01:36:38.615 --> 01:36:40.606
So I'm taking her in low.

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:43.331
When we're over the target,

01:36:44.175 --> 01:36:46.211
climbing to 5,000 feet.

01:36:47.295 --> 01:36:49.490
Bombs are set to go at 5,000.

01:36:51.934 --> 01:36:53.606
We'll go with them.

01:36:57.256 --> 01:36:58.405
Okay?

01:37:04.457 --> 01:37:07.767
What the hell.
There's nothing to go home to anyway.

01:37:18.539 --> 01:37:22.531
General Stark, are there any papers
or documents in New York

01:37:22.618 --> 01:37:26.691
which are absolutely essential
to the running of the United States?

01:37:27.898 --> 01:37:29.331
General Stark?

01:37:30.498 --> 01:37:31.772
No, sir.

01:37:32.338 --> 01:37:36.777
There are important documents,
but none of them absolutely essential.

01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.936
Will there be any warning given?

01:37:41.701 --> 01:37:44.454
A lot of lives could be saved
if people had a few minutes.

01:37:44.541 --> 01:37:47.772
On this short notice, an alert to a big city
would do more harm than good.

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:49.977
All you'd produce is panic.

01:37:52.660 --> 01:37:54.252
What about this?

01:38:03.702 --> 01:38:04.930
Maybe...

01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:09.141
Maybe he doesn't know his wife is there.

01:38:10.222 --> 01:38:11.542
He knows.

01:38:17.703 --> 01:38:19.899
Gentlemen, we are wasting time.

01:38:21.625 --> 01:38:23.694
I've been making a few rough calculations

01:38:23.784 --> 01:38:26.173
based on the effect
of two 20-megaton bombs

01:38:26.264 --> 01:38:29.813
dropped on New York City
in the middle of a normal workday.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:32.543
I estimate the immediate dead
at about three million.

01:38:32.624 --> 01:38:36.856
I include in this figure those buried
beneath the collapsed buildings.

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:38.697
Wouldn't make any difference,
Admiral Wilcox,

01:38:38.785 --> 01:38:41.015
whether they reached a shelter or not.

01:38:41.105 --> 01:38:43.256
They would die just the same.

01:38:43.946 --> 01:38:47.826
Add another million or two
who'll die within about five weeks.

01:38:49.307 --> 01:38:53.663
Now our immediate problem would be
the joint one of fire control and excavation.

01:38:53.746 --> 01:38:57.341
Excavation not of the dead.
The effort would be wasted there.

01:38:57.426 --> 01:39:00.419
But even though there are no irreplaceable
government documents in the city,

01:39:00.507 --> 01:39:03.817
many of our largest corporations
keep their records there.

01:39:04.107 --> 01:39:06.019
It will be necessary

01:39:08.628 --> 01:39:11.461
to rescue as many of those records
as we can.

01:39:17.308 --> 01:39:19.380
Our economy depends on this.

01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:27.101
Our economy depends on this.

01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:36.459
"And the Lord said," gentlemen,

01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:39.541
"he who is without sin,

01:39:40.151 --> 01:39:42.540
"let him cast the first stone."

01:39:51.272 --> 01:39:52.307
Sir?

01:39:56.152 --> 01:39:58.143
May I have a drink, please?

01:40:08.313 --> 01:40:12.785
How'd you ever get to be a translator, Buck?
You don't seem the academic type.

01:40:13.914 --> 01:40:17.111
I guess I've got this talent
for languages, sir.

01:40:18.434 --> 01:40:22.508
I hear a language once, I pick it right up.
I don't even know how.

01:40:24.715 --> 01:40:27.103
And they found out about it in the army.

01:40:27.194 --> 01:40:30.905
- You sound sorry they did.
- Oh, no. Very interesting job.

01:40:33.676 --> 01:40:35.871
I mean, sometimes.

01:40:36.916 --> 01:40:39.555
Well, you did a good job today, Buck.

01:40:40.316 --> 01:40:44.071
Thank you, sir.
All I did was repeat what he said.

01:40:44.957 --> 01:40:47.915
You didn't freeze up.
Another man might have.

01:40:49.837 --> 01:40:52.033
You're the one who didn't, sir.

01:40:56.118 --> 01:40:59.427
I wonder what it's like out.
Looked like rain before.

01:41:01.157 --> 01:41:04.071
Radio said it would clear by the afternoon.

01:41:09.479 --> 01:41:11.071
The Premier, sir.

01:41:11.759 --> 01:41:13.352
Yes, Mr Chairman.

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:18.599
Mr President,

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:25.639
I have ordered our long-range missiles
to stand down from their alert.

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:33.190
Only that part of our defense that has
a chance of shooting down your bomber

01:41:34.361 --> 01:41:35.954
is still active.

01:41:36.562 --> 01:41:39.440
We do not think we have much of a chance.

01:41:40.322 --> 01:41:41.391
I know.

01:41:43.483 --> 01:41:46.520
And yet, this was nobody's fault.

01:41:46.603 --> 01:41:48.082
I don't agree.

01:41:49.043 --> 01:41:51.079
No human being did wrong.

01:41:53.003 --> 01:41:54.755
No one here is to be blamed.

01:41:54.843 --> 01:41:58.802
We're to blame, both of us.
We let our machines get out of hand.

01:42:00.763 --> 01:42:03.483
Still, it was an accident.

01:42:04.204 --> 01:42:07.560
Two great cities may be destroyed,
millions of innocent people killed.

01:42:07.644 --> 01:42:10.284
What do we say to them, Mr Chairman?
"Accidents will happen"?

01:42:10.365 --> 01:42:12.162
I won't accept that.

01:42:15.245 --> 01:42:19.637
All I know
is that as long as we have weapons...

01:42:19.726 --> 01:42:24.482
All I know is that men are responsible.
We're responsible for what happens to us.

01:42:24.847 --> 01:42:26.360
Today we had a taste of the future.

01:42:26.447 --> 01:42:29.358
Do we learn from it,
or do we go on the way we have?

01:42:29.446 --> 01:42:32.961
What do we do, Mr Chairman?
What do we say to the dead?

01:42:36.286 --> 01:42:38.278
I think, if we are men,

01:42:39.447 --> 01:42:40.880
we must say,

01:42:42.207 --> 01:42:44.279
this will not happen again.

01:42:45.609 --> 01:42:49.841
But do you think it possible
with all that stands between us?

01:42:49.929 --> 01:42:52.523
We put it there, Mr Chairman,
and we're not helpless.

01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:55.248
What we put between us, we can remove.

01:42:58.009 --> 01:43:00.398
- Mr President?
- Yes, Jay.

01:43:01.209 --> 01:43:04.599
I can hear the sound of explosions
from the northeast

01:43:04.850 --> 01:43:07.410
The sky is very bright, all lit up...

01:43:24.132 --> 01:43:26.249
Put me through to General Black.

01:43:38.052 --> 01:43:39.690
Yes, Mr President

01:43:40.412 --> 01:43:41.606
Blackie.

01:43:42.293 --> 01:43:44.045
Yes, Mr President?

01:43:44.493 --> 01:43:46.450
Moscow's been destroyed.

01:43:47.454 --> 01:43:49.888
Drop your bombs according to plan.

01:43:50.734 --> 01:43:52.053
Yes, sir.

01:44:01.334 --> 01:44:05.567
You've all been briefed on the mission,
so there's nothing more to say.

01:44:06.256 --> 01:44:08.372
I have only one last order.

01:44:09.576 --> 01:44:11.407
Nobody else is to have

01:44:12.496 --> 01:44:15.568
anything to do with the dropping
of the bombs.

01:44:17.136 --> 01:44:21.652
Repeat:
I will fly the plane and release the bombs.

01:44:24.296 --> 01:44:26.333
The final act is my own.

01:44:26.577 --> 01:44:29.537
On course, sir. Approaching target.

01:44:31.819 --> 01:44:34.491
Count down from ten. Give me the signal.

01:44:38.578 --> 01:44:40.409
- Now.
- Ten, nine,

01:44:40.498 --> 01:44:43.854
eight, seven, six, five,

01:44:44.098 --> 01:44:47.854
four, three, two, one.

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.089
Mark.

01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.773
General Black!

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.060
Katie, the dream.

01:45:01.141 --> 01:45:02.415
The dream!

01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:06.979
The matador.

01:45:08.702 --> 01:45:10.055
The matador!

01:45:11.622 --> 01:45:13.021
The matador.

01:45:15.702 --> 01:45:16.817
Me!

01:45:17.982 --> 01:45:19.051
Me.
