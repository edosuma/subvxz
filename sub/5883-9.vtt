01:13.866 --> 01:17.034
-Hello?
-Do you ever pray on a difficult problem?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.455
Connie.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.708
l had this revelation.

01:24.001 --> 01:28.671
New York City is not
a domestic destination like, say, Dallas.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.425
l'm sorry. What?

01:32.509 --> 01:36.804
You know, God speaks to us.
We have an impulse and we act on it.

01:40.517 --> 01:44.270
-That's very interesting.
-So how do we know to do it, Don?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.814
How do we know to do something?

01:48.567 --> 01:49.859
lnstinct.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.236
So, you're just like a dog?

01:54.031 --> 01:59.118
l knew the patina of the Waldorf would
shine over all my domestic properties,

01:59.203 --> 02:01.662
but it hasn't worked abroad.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.374
l know l just gave you New York,
but can you help me with that?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.962
You want me to take
your international business, Connie?

02:10.422 --> 02:15.510
l want you to earn it. A little bit of wow,
as a lady friend of mine used to say.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.430
Let me think on that.

02:20.182 --> 02:24.727
lt sounds like pride, but l want Hiltons
all over the world, like missions.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.855
l want a Hilton on the moon.
That's where we're headed.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.067
Okay.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.863
America is wherever we look,
wherever we're going to be.

02:37.825 --> 02:41.744
-That's very good, Connie.
-You're the one who said that to me.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.999
Well, l guess it's not that memorable.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.211
Write up a proposal for
the New York Hiltons as convention spaces.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.464
Send it over to me by noon.
l'll take it on the plane.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.299
Done.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.262
Goodbye.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.481
-l'm sorry about that.
-lt's okay.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.236
l don't think the 4:00 a.m. feedings
are over yet.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.364
"l want what l want when l want it,"

03:18.699 --> 03:21.826
and you don't care what it does
to the rest of us.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.496
Like someone else l know. Yeah.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.709
Baby's up every three hours.
Hilton only calls every four.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.586
l think you like it.

03:37.968 --> 03:39.677
What are you doing?

03:40.971 --> 03:43.973
l can't sleep. l'm going in.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.576
What are you doing?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.786
-l'm running.
-ln the dark?

04:05.996 --> 04:08.915
lt's cool, it's quiet and no one bothers me.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.711
You're wrong about that.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.505
Let me give you a ride.
Where are you going?

04:16.590 --> 04:19.842
l'm going home,
and the whole idea is to run there.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.596
Well, take a break. You smoke?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.725
-The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King...
-Take me up to Ross Lane.

04:27.809 --> 04:31.103
...president of the southern Christian
Leadership Conference, spoke at the march.

04:31.188 --> 04:36.776
I have a dream that my four little children...

04:37.194 --> 04:38.694
-Don't.
-...will one day live in a nation

04:38.779 --> 04:41.948
where they will not be judged
by the color of their skin

04:42.032 --> 04:45.993
but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.876
Two young women were brutally murdered
in their Upper East side apartment...

04:55.379 --> 04:59.507
When school starts,
l'm going to read it to the kids the first day.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.010
Do you think they can understand it?

05:03.095 --> 05:07.932
l think they already know it, and it'd be nice
for them to hear an adult say it.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.019
Who are you?

05:14.815 --> 05:18.067
l mean, dumb or pure?

05:21.071 --> 05:24.991
Running out here in the middle of the night
and l run into you.

05:26.243 --> 05:30.079
-How did that happen?
-What are you doing on the road?

05:32.624 --> 05:34.750
l don't know. l can't sleep.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.424
-Right or left?
-Just let me out up here.

05:52.894 --> 05:57.440
-lt's a nice house.
-l rent the apartment over the garage.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.153
-Have coffee with me.
-You'll be late for work.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.614
l'm always late. lt's coffee.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.788
Maybe that's why you can't sleep.
Too much coffee.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.350
Good morning.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.730
Sorry.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.816
How long have you been there?
l had no idea.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.652
Can you get me some coffee, please?
And l need you to type this up

06:43.737 --> 06:45.571
and get it to Hilton
before he leaves for Europe.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.740
Actually, he's going to California.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.410
He already left two messages on the service.
Do you want me to get him?

06:51.495 --> 06:55.081
-This. Coffee. Hilton.
-Of course.

07:12.516 --> 07:15.851
-Mr. Draper usually brings this in.
-He left early.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.024
-Can we go outside now?
-lt's raining. Go upstairs.

07:32.202 --> 07:36.997
-l did not sleep last night.
-Go take a nap. l'll shop in the afternoon.

08:20.584 --> 08:24.920
lt could either be the view of the Acropolis,
orjust these big columns,

08:25.005 --> 08:27.006
like you're standing there.

08:27.090 --> 08:32.511
Then below it,
"Your window on the world. Hilton," period.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.515
That window looks as old to me
as those columns.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.935
Did anybody look at a picture
of the Athens Hilton?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.605
Sliding doors don't read as windows.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.440
And believe it or not,
we're not allowed to pretend

08:44.524 --> 08:48.527
that that's the view from the window
of the Hilton, because it's not.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.196
Other than that?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.448
The tag is flat.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.910
-Well, that one's yours.
-That doesn't make it good.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.037
lf it's bad, don't use it.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.457
What else?

09:02.334 --> 09:07.213
There are 1 6 graphically-perfect reduced
photographs of Hilton hotels all on a grid.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.466
-Simple headline.
-"Go. We'll meet you anywhere."

09:12.135 --> 09:17.223
Now that l can finally understand you, l am
less impressed with what you have to say.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.309
That's your work, too.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.147
-Who's we?
-We are Hilton.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.983
And how do l know that?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.320
Take out a magnifying glass
and look at one of those tiny hotels?

09:31.446 --> 09:34.323
l write "Hilton" very big under this Greek.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.618
There is no deadline.

09:37.702 --> 09:41.872
l want to see work as you think of it.
Give me more ideas to reject.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.583
l can't do this all by myself.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.429
-l'm telling you, it's bad for me.
-What's that supposed to mean?

10:05.397 --> 10:09.692
And cut! Well, l think we've finally got it.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.611
l told you, you had it the first time,
if that's what you want.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.197
And l told you l want what you want.

10:15.782 --> 10:19.243
-Where is he supposed to be looking?
-Onto the horizon.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.954
We want people to focus on the Lucky.

10:23.206 --> 10:27.042
-This is what your father signed off on.
-Let me see it again.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.713
Nathaniel, again, please.
Watch through the camera.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.965
That's a good idea.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.469
Action.

10:47.105 --> 10:52.318
l just don't know what he's looking at.
l want him staring right at us at the end.

10:53.695 --> 11:00.576
There's a style for the draw on these spots
and it's stop, inhale, 1 ,000-yard stare.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.787
Tell me what you think.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.502
l think you're the client
and we should do what you want.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.506
-lt can make people very uncomfortable.
-Walter Cronkite does it every night.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.718
Let's take a risk together,
shall we, Sally?

11:18.094 --> 11:22.723
Going again. This time, Nathaniel,
on the draw, look right in the lens.

11:31.775 --> 11:36.070
It's Wednesday, september 4th,
and currently 64 degrees in Manhattan.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.955
We have to get a pencil case.

11:47.582 --> 11:51.377
-What's wrong with your pencil box?
-How was the first day?

11:52.045 --> 11:54.630
l wish l could've found the camera,

11:54.881 --> 11:56.423
just so we could see the difference
on your face

11:56.508 --> 12:00.052
from when you left this morning
to when l picked you up.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.263
-So, you like your teacher?
-She's okay.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.974
lt's Mrs. Patton. All they do is draw.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.603
ls this today's mail?

12:13.608 --> 12:15.609
-l'll get him.
-Would you?

12:46.850 --> 12:49.351
You're so quiet. You must be tired.

12:50.228 --> 12:54.648
l'm not tired. l really want a pencil case
to put in my loose-leaf.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.234
We'll see.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.156
Lucky strike, the hard-working smoke
with that smooth and honest taste.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.701
-Cut.
-So, it's a rhythm?

13:06.369 --> 13:09.788
That's true. Obviously, it'll sound better
with the announcer's voice.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.249
lt sounded like you had a half a pastrami
in your mouth.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.294
lt's a scratch track. l didn't know
you were gonna show it to the client.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.212
l know l'm supposed to stay away
till the screening,

13:17.297 --> 13:19.465
but l am fascinated by this process.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.134
You're thinking about getting out
of cigarettes and into the movies?

13:22.218 --> 13:24.344
Not while my father's alive.

13:24.554 --> 13:28.599
Well, if we rerecord the sound tonight,
we can probably finish this.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.852
l heard you the first time.
l'll be in the booth.

13:38.943 --> 13:43.655
l'd appreciate it if you'd forget
all that nonsense l was saying before.

13:44.574 --> 13:48.535
-What are you talking about?
-The movies, my father.

13:50.038 --> 13:55.083
-Forgotten.
-Sorry, but l had a long, wet lunch.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.838
-Really? Too much to drink.
-And other things.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.176
Secretaries nowadays,
they don't give you a choice.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.094
You know what l mean?

14:06.429 --> 14:09.348
-l don't have a secretary.
-How'd my shot turn out?

14:09.432 --> 14:12.392
l'm not sure. l think it's gonna feel strange.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.854
Lucky Strike has a way of doing things.
Look at this.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.654
Yeah, see? l don't think that's so bad.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.916
Come on. He's not coming back for a while.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.337
l'll lock the door.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.549
-l'm married.
-So am l.

14:45.468 --> 14:49.471
-There's been a misunderstanding.
-l know what l know.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.565
Jerry should have the tracks done.

14:59.649 --> 15:03.151
You can see the whole thing tomorrow
or when it's done.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.446
l'll probably be busy tomorrow.

15:09.576 --> 15:14.204
l got it. You're at work. That's too bad.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.852
-How about a nasty old alligator?
-He has a point.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.563
Down, Sue. I'll handle this.

15:40.857 --> 15:44.776
"Henry, I'm so pleased there's a place
that I can write to you.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.738
"The children are finally
back in school now, and I must admit

15:47.822 --> 15:51.366
"that I like the idea of looking forward
to the mail's arrival every day.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.660
"Well, not every day. Ha, ha.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.832
"I don't write many letters anymore,
so I apologize in advance

15:58.916 --> 16:02.085
"if I'm unable to accurately
express my thoughts.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.171
"But I do have thoughts,

16:04.714 --> 16:08.967
"and I suppose I wonder too much
where you are and what you're doing.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.641
"We've only met three times,
you know that? Isn't that strange?

16:17.143 --> 16:20.354
"I wish I had a clearer picture of you
in my mind.

16:21.397 --> 16:25.734
"Anyway, that's all I have to report.
I hope to hear from you. B."

16:38.081 --> 16:39.456
Don't touch it.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.251
-l've seen this one. lt whitens.
-lt's not about what you want to watch.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.836
l have to make sure
they run every commercial.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.798
...pillowcases, socks, towels, everything.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.135
My mother-in-law says
l look like Perry Mason.

16:52.637 --> 16:56.098
lt's not a compliment.
lt means she thinks you're fat.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.436
-Crane.
-Harry, it's Lee Garner.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.356
l knew you'd still be there.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.443
-You work hard, don't you?
-For you? You bet.

17:08.528 --> 17:13.115
Look, l don't want to keep you,
but l have a bit of a problem.

17:13.908 --> 17:17.786
-What's wrong?
-lt's that Salvatore fellow, the director.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.207
He's no good. l'd like him gone.

17:23.292 --> 17:27.129
-What happened?
-Well, l can't work with him. Get rid of him.

17:28.339 --> 17:31.258
-Well, l can't do that.
-Excuse me?

17:31.926 --> 17:35.971
No, l'm not really... l can't.
Pete and Roger handle your account.

17:36.264 --> 17:40.684
No, no. No, no, no, Harry.
l want you to take care of this,

17:42.145 --> 17:44.479
and l want you to keep it just between us.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.608
Crane, you there?

17:49.444 --> 17:53.572
Listen, Lee. l hope you know
the commercial's turning out beautiful.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.742
-You really have an eye, you know.
-l do, do l?

17:57.034 --> 18:01.163
-Are you enjoying the city?
-l am. Plenty to do.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.001
Well, you have a good night.
l should get back to work.

18:06.461 --> 18:09.504
-Sorry to trouble you. Good night.
-Good night.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.843
-What was that?
-You don't want to know.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.054
-l think l do.
-l can't tell you.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.932
Now l really do.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.271
-Lee Garner Jr. asked me to get rid of Sal.
-What'd he do?

18:26.606 --> 18:29.941
l didn't ask. He was drunk as a skunk
and he's scary to begin with.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.485
What are you gonna do, call Campbell?

18:31.569 --> 18:34.946
That's the other thing.
He said to keep it between us.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.907
What are you gonna do?

18:37.784 --> 18:41.119
l'm not gonna panic
and do something stupid like l usually do.

18:41.204 --> 18:44.498
-That's a good start.
-l can't really do anything, can l?

18:44.582 --> 18:46.374
He was really drunk.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.502
The show's on.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.630
Great, l missed all the commercials.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.980
-Hello?
-Don, it's Conrad Hilton.

19:09.774 --> 19:10.941
ls it?

19:11.192 --> 19:15.487
Now, don't be like that.
l know it's a privilege to call you at home.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.157
l don't think l've worn it out. lt's 1 1 :30.

19:21.536 --> 19:25.121
-lt's not a problem, Connie.
-Can you come have a drink with me?

19:26.457 --> 19:29.793
-Right now?
-You can say no. l've heard it before.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.797
And for all you know,
you're not the first person l asked.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.550
l'll be there.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.052
Give me an hour.

19:41.764 --> 19:42.931
Hello?

19:46.269 --> 19:50.063
-So what is that, moonshine?
-No, but it is from Prohibition.

19:50.648 --> 19:54.609
l have two cases,
and they both say "hair tonic" on the side.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.586
l remember this.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.718
l think you know
l'm in a bit of a crisis tonight.

20:20.469 --> 20:24.931
-l didn't know that.
-l think about my business day and night.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.810
And l'm a harsh critic, especially of myself.

20:30.980 --> 20:35.025
And sometimes it collects, and l feel bad.

20:37.904 --> 20:43.617
And then l realize
maybe that's the reason l'm so lonesome.

20:45.661 --> 20:49.289
-You might be working too much.
-l'm not working enough.

20:52.126 --> 20:57.589
lt's my purpose in life
to bring America to the world,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.717
whether they like it or not.

21:02.511 --> 21:08.683
You know, we are a force of good, Don,
because we have God.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.687
Communists don't.

21:13.522 --> 21:17.150
lt's their most important belief.
Did you know that?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.612
l'm not an expert.

21:21.447 --> 21:26.242
Generosity. The Marshall Plan,
you remember that?

21:28.371 --> 21:33.375
Everyone who saw our ways
wanted to be us.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.546
l'm glad you're telling me this.

21:40.841 --> 21:45.595
After all the things we threw at Khrushchev,
you know what made him fall apart?

21:46.514 --> 21:48.848
He couldn't get into Disneyland.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.064
-That's good.
-You never heard that?

21:57.441 --> 22:01.236
Well, l did, but when l hear you say it,
it sounds beautiful.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.575
l don't want any politics in my campaign.
You know that.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.955
But there should be...

22:13.833 --> 22:18.753
Goodness, and confidence.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.259
Thanks for listening to me, Don.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.763
You know, sometimes l look around here,

22:30.641 --> 22:35.979
and l think, "By golly, l'm King Midas."

22:39.066 --> 22:42.444
Stop it. You're not.

22:48.159 --> 22:51.369
You're my angel, you know that?
You're like a son.

22:54.248 --> 22:58.752
ln fact,
sometimes you're more than a son to me

23:00.796 --> 23:03.757
because you didn't have what they had,

23:07.303 --> 23:09.054
and you understand.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.141
Thank you.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.523
l mean it.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.380
Come in, come in, come in.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.219
l drove all the way down to get the mail,
and then l turned around and l debated it.

23:49.303 --> 23:53.306
-l went past the exit a dozen times, and...
-My girl is due back.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.892
l know l shouldn't be here.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.855
lt's just, l wanted to see you.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.818
l wasn't thinking.

24:06.695 --> 24:10.406
-What do l say? Why are you here?
-There you are.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.202
Carla, this is Henry Francis.
He works for Governor Rockefeller.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.162
lt's nice to meet you.

24:17.915 --> 24:22.627
So anyway, l think this is
an excellent venue for a fundraiser.

24:24.755 --> 24:28.550
-Good. l'll have to check with my husband.
-Of course.

24:29.844 --> 24:34.097
Carla, will you show Mr. Francis out?
l think l left the bath running.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.059
-A pleasure to meet you.
-You as well.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.206
l can't get this. Lucy, do you mind?

25:08.549 --> 25:10.300
Jesus, knock it off.

25:10.593 --> 25:13.386
lt's a Lucky Strike commercial.
lt's got three cuts in it.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.764
So the hillbilly says, "That ain't my finger."

25:18.642 --> 25:21.853
l'm gonna have to hear
the beginning of that joke.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.192
Lee? Lee!

25:32.281 --> 25:34.949
-What's going on?
-l have no idea.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.411
Does someone know what's going on?
Speak up.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.704
l know.

25:40.414 --> 25:43.541
Lee Garner Jr. called me
a couple of days ago. l'm sorry.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.710
-Why is he calling you?
-l don't know.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.963
-He did, and he told me to get rid of Sal.
-What?

25:49.048 --> 25:51.674
And you made an executive decision
to do nothing?

25:51.759 --> 25:53.885
He was really drunk.
l thought it would blow over.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.136
l didn't even think he'd remember.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.388
When you get in trouble,
you call Mommy and Daddy.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.891
He told me not to tell you,
so what was l supposed to do?

25:59.975 --> 26:03.603
Everyone's an account man. What exactly
do you think we do here, Crane?

26:03.687 --> 26:05.355
We handle clients.

26:05.481 --> 26:09.525
-He wouldn't say a word. He just left.
-Sal, you're fired.

26:10.861 --> 26:14.072
-Are you serious?
-Lee Garner Jr. wants you fired.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.954
We're gonna find out
what he wants to do with you, imbecile.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.456
-Oh, God.
-What the hell happened?

26:25.334 --> 26:26.918
What is going on?

26:27.002 --> 26:31.005
Now, you're gonna use your dying breath
to tell Don to fix this.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.716
-Don?
-Lee Garner has a problem with creative,

26:33.801 --> 26:37.845
let Don solve it.
He does it all now anyway. Now!

26:41.725 --> 26:44.102
-What did Lee say to you?
-Nothing. l have to talk to Don.

26:44.186 --> 26:47.689
-Let me talk to Don.
-l'm doing as l'm told. ls he busy?

26:48.524 --> 26:51.818
l can see you and l can hear you.
What do you want?

26:56.031 --> 26:57.073
Who died?

26:57.157 --> 27:00.535
-l screwed up with Lee Garner Jr.
-What?

27:01.120 --> 27:04.330
-How do l explain this?
-He told Harry to fire me.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.542
-Harry?
-l didn't, but now Roger did.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.086
-Roger did what?
-He fired me.

27:10.629 --> 27:14.048
Roger said to tell you to fix it.
Those are his words.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.717
Fantastic.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.513
That's a $25 million account
you stuck your nose in, Crane.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.642
Just get out.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.483
What happened?

27:32.568 --> 27:36.195
Lee Garner got drunk,
and he told Harry to fire me,

27:36.322 --> 27:39.991
and then Roger got angry and he did.
l think if l get away from Lucky Strike

27:40.075 --> 27:42.744
and lay low from Roger for a day or two,
everything will be fine.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.997
l understand what just happened.
What happened with the cut?

27:46.081 --> 27:49.500
-The commercial's fine.
-Sal, something must've happened.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.586
l can't help you unless you tell me.

27:51.670 --> 27:55.840
-We had a misunderstanding.
-Jesus. l'm not gonna ask again.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.101
He was drunk,
and he cornered me in the editing room.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.314
-Cornered you?
-Yes.

28:12.316 --> 28:15.985
And l backed him off,
l told him l was married,

28:16.070 --> 28:18.571
and he was embarrassed and he left.

28:21.742 --> 28:25.161
-You must've been really shocked.
-l was, believe me.

28:26.413 --> 28:28.206
But nothing happened,

28:28.999 --> 28:32.710
because nothing could have happened
because you're married?

28:33.754 --> 28:37.757
-Don, l swear on my mother's life.
-You sure you want to do that?

28:41.678 --> 28:44.180
Who do you think you're talking to?

28:45.432 --> 28:48.476
l guess l was just supposed to do
whatever he wanted?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.936
What if it was some girl?

28:50.020 --> 28:54.440
That would depend on what kind of girl
it was and what l knew about her.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.569
You people.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.909
l didn't do anything but turn him down.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.162
He's a bully.

29:09.623 --> 29:12.208
Lucky Strike can shut off our lights.

29:20.968 --> 29:24.345
l think you know
that this is the way this has to be.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.022
You'll do fine.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.330
Get me Lee Garner Jr.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.132
l said l don't want salad.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.719
Watch your tone, young man.
Carla works for me, not you.

30:05.762 --> 30:09.515
-What do you want instead?
-You might as well call it a day.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.101
Okay. Thank you.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.982
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.611
How was your day?

30:23.906 --> 30:25.198
Not good.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.829
l didn't want to bother you with it,
but that man dropped by today

30:31.914 --> 30:34.749
from the governor's office. Carla met him.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.962
Francine sent him over here.

30:40.255 --> 30:44.133
They want to have a fundraiser,
but her house isn't big enough.

30:44.426 --> 30:47.595
l don't care, as long as l don't have to go.
When is it?

30:47.679 --> 30:49.639
Well, l should be going.

30:51.225 --> 30:53.559
Soon. Next week, l think.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.438
-A fundraiser for Rockefeller.
-For the campaign.

30:59.775 --> 31:03.236
-l'm gonna go lay down. Good night, Carla.
-Good night.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.030
-Good night, children.
-Good night.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.198
Bye.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.992
Good night, Mrs. Draper.

31:21.630 --> 31:25.466
lf you're here, do l have to be here?
Because l'm leaving.

31:26.301 --> 31:29.303
-No, go ahead.
-Good night, boss.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.570
-Henry Francis.
-Hello. I thought I'd get the service.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.698
This is Betty Draper.

31:49.658 --> 31:53.202
l know that.
Listen, l shouldn't have come by like that.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.123
-l hope l'm not calling too late.
-No, you're not.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.542
l checked with my husband
about the fundraiser.

32:00.877 --> 32:04.171
-The fundraiser?
-Yes, we'd be glad to do that.

32:04.590 --> 32:08.718
How's Tuesday the 1 7th?
Can you make it then? ls that good for you?

32:09.511 --> 32:12.430
Okay. l guess
you're going through with this.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.016
l had to.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.937
l'll have my girl call you tomorrow
to make it official.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.774
l look forward to it. Let me know
what's usually provided by the host.

32:24.693 --> 32:25.776
Sure.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.863
Goodbye.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.032
Good night, Betty.

32:36.872 --> 32:42.543
Rome, Tehran, Tokyo
are magnificent destinations,

32:43.378 --> 32:46.297
and that's really been the focus
of almost every campaign you've had

32:46.381 --> 32:49.884
up till now.
How to lure the American traveler abroad.

32:50.969 --> 32:55.306
What more do we need than a picture
ofAthens to get our hearts racing?

32:55.474 --> 32:59.310
And yet the average American
experiences a level of luxury

32:59.394 --> 33:02.730
that belongs only to kings
in most of the world.

33:04.191 --> 33:07.360
We're not chauvinists.
We just have expectations.

33:08.695 --> 33:13.783
Well, now there's one word that promises
the thrill of international travel

33:15.285 --> 33:18.663
with the comfort of home. Hilton.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.836
"How do you say ice water
in ltalian? Hilton."

33:27.422 --> 33:32.259
"How do you say fresh towels
in Farsi? Hilton."

33:33.804 --> 33:38.182
"How do you say hamburger
in Japanese? Hilton."

33:41.269 --> 33:44.188
"Hilton." lt's the same in every language.

33:46.441 --> 33:50.861
Maybe fried chicken. l don't like
the sound of "hamburger" and "Hilton."

33:51.238 --> 33:54.281
Besides, "hamburger"
is already a foreign word.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.866
We'll see.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.838
lt's good. Very good.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.717
lt's clever, yet friendly. Draws you in.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.971
But what about the moon?

34:17.848 --> 34:20.766
-Excuse me?
-There's nothing about the moon.

34:20.892 --> 34:23.561
Well, right now,
that's not an actual destination.

34:23.645 --> 34:27.273
That wasn't the point.
l said l wanted Hilton on the moon.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.484
l couldn't have been more clear about it.

34:30.610 --> 34:36.866
Well, l'll admit l misunderstood that.
l'm sure there's a way to fit that into this.

34:41.872 --> 34:43.998
Well, isn't this something?

34:48.003 --> 34:50.671
l'd like to speak with Don in private.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.106
This is a good campaign, one of the best.

35:09.191 --> 35:12.443
lt's modern, it's witty, it's eye-catching.
lt will change your business.

35:12.527 --> 35:16.363
Calm down.
l'm going to speak very honestly with you.

35:17.365 --> 35:21.577
l don't think folks do that often.
Probably scared.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.120
Or they trust my work.

35:23.205 --> 35:26.373
You want me to just say yes
to everything you do?

35:26.917 --> 35:31.378
Most ad men believe that clients are
the thing that gets in the way of good work.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.589
l've never experienced that.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.510
You did not give me what l wanted.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.680
l'm deeply disappointed, Don.

35:44.184 --> 35:46.185
This is a great campaign.

35:46.770 --> 35:51.982
Fine. What do you want from me? Love?
Your work is good.

35:58.573 --> 36:02.660
But when l say l want the moon,
l expect the moon.

36:12.754 --> 36:16.423
-l said if he ran, l'd support him.
-l haven't decided yet.

36:16.967 --> 36:20.010
l voted for Kennedy.
l'll probably vote for him again.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.431
What a nice turnout.

36:24.641 --> 36:28.727
-Where's Henry Francis?
-l don't know. Someone's supposed to talk.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.022
l don't know anything about Rockefeller.
That's why l did this.

36:32.107 --> 36:34.608
Well, l want to know
how he's gonna deal with the South.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.402
Do you know how bad it must be
for the negroes

36:36.486 --> 36:39.363
to descend on Washington like that
just to be heard?

36:39.447 --> 36:42.449
Segregation is uncivilized. lt's that simple.

36:42.534 --> 36:47.788
You know what my father says
about the South? "lt's not 1 963, it's 1 863."

36:49.791 --> 36:50.791
Thank you.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.587
Mrs. Draper, l'm Elsa Kittridge
and l work with Mr. Francis.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.131
Pleasure to meet you.
l assume he's been delayed.

36:57.215 --> 37:01.468
Actually he asked that l address the group
on behalf of the governor.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.930
That's disappointing.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.725
l mean, l don't think it's going
to help your fundraising

37:07.809 --> 37:10.060
when you promise one thing
and deliver another.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.854
Well, perhaps you're right,

37:11.938 --> 37:15.065
but he seemed to think
l was a better match to the group,

37:15.150 --> 37:17.151
and l am extremely informed.

37:17.235 --> 37:20.321
ln fact, l'm the person
who briefs Mr. Francis.

37:22.657 --> 37:26.744
l think you'll see l won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

37:27.495 --> 37:31.457
-Please, begin whenever you want.
-No, you begin, dear.

37:39.382 --> 37:43.010
Excuse me, my name is Betty Draper.
Welcome to my home.

37:43.637 --> 37:46.221
-We're going to listen to...
-Elsa Kittridge,

37:46.306 --> 37:49.350
Associate in the Governor's
lnformation Office.

37:52.103 --> 37:56.607
First l would like to dispel the rumor that
there is a mandatory contribution tonight.

37:56.691 --> 38:00.694
This is a taking of a pulse,
an exchange of ideas.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.674
Please see that we're not disturbed.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.059
Hey!

38:32.894 --> 38:35.312
Mr. Francis, do you need anything?

38:36.147 --> 38:40.484
-No, Marjorie, l dropped something.
-Where were you last night?

38:40.819 --> 38:43.153
-Calm down.
-Why didn't you come?

38:43.405 --> 38:45.739
Why did you send that woman?

38:46.908 --> 38:52.079
-l watched the door all night like a sap.
-l'm sorry, but l wanted you to come to me.

38:53.623 --> 38:56.041
-The ego.
-Would you listen to me?

38:56.167 --> 38:58.919
-You had to come to me.
-And why is that?

39:01.715 --> 39:03.590
Because you're married.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.578
No, Henry.

39:34.247 --> 39:35.706
What's wrong?

39:36.332 --> 39:39.460
Please. We're locked in this office.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.965
What? On the desk? On the couch?

39:46.051 --> 39:48.594
-We should get a room somewhere.
-No.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.097
lt's tawdry.

39:55.477 --> 39:56.810
l'm sorry.

39:59.689 --> 40:02.441
l'm very sorry. l started this.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.324
l don't know what you want.

40:17.457 --> 40:18.707
Goodbye.

40:27.842 --> 40:31.261
-Mr. sterling's here to see you.
-Send him in.

40:35.016 --> 40:38.185
l heard Conrad Hilton left this building
in a huff yesterday.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.770
Who told you that?

40:39.854 --> 40:43.398
You've got your face so deep in Hilton's
lap, you're ignoring everything else.

40:43.483 --> 40:46.944
-Everything's under control.
-You won't even let me meet the man.

40:47.028 --> 40:50.906
What do you think accounts does,
besides limit your brilliance?

40:53.076 --> 40:55.035
l'd tell you,
but l don't want to hurt your feelings.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.453
Keep joking about it.

40:56.538 --> 41:00.624
We've had two clients in one week
leave here angry. lmportant clients.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.460
ls that what you want this place
to be known for?

41:03.545 --> 41:06.713
That and some guy losing his foot
in a lawnmower?

41:07.382 --> 41:10.843
l want to put you on notice,
you are in over your head.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.517
These children,

41:20.311 --> 41:24.148
unoffending, innocent and beautiful,

41:26.776 --> 41:32.030
were the victims
of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes

41:34.075 --> 41:36.785
ever perpetrated against humanity.

41:39.914 --> 41:42.666
You can leave it on your station.
l don't mind.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.043
-lt's all right.
-What was that?

41:46.588 --> 41:50.090
The funeral service
for the little girls in Birmingham.

41:51.426 --> 41:53.177
lt's so horrifying.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.932
Are you okay? Do you need a day off?

41:59.976 --> 42:02.394
No, l'm fine. Thank you.

42:06.691 --> 42:10.944
l hate to say this, but it's really
made me wonder about civil rights.

42:11.446 --> 42:14.323
Maybe it's not supposed
to happen right now.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.953
-Hello, Mr. Draper.
-Hello.

42:20.580 --> 42:23.999
You just missed bedtime.
They're probably still awake.

42:34.344 --> 42:37.804
No, don't bother with dinner.
We got Chinese takeout.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.976
Listen, Marty needs me
to look over this work.

42:43.519 --> 42:45.312
Don't wait up for me.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.232
l love you, too.

43:33.611 --> 43:34.778
Betts.

43:36.364 --> 43:37.447
What?

43:38.950 --> 43:41.618
Hilton just called. l'm going in.

43:44.122 --> 43:46.081
l didn't hear the phone.

43:50.003 --> 43:51.628
Go back to sleep.

44:16.821 --> 44:19.740
-Someone's going to see you.
-Then let me in.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.383
This is nice.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.264
What can l do for you?

44:45.350 --> 44:47.768
l don't know. l wanted to talk.

44:49.103 --> 44:52.314
Right. Says the man
as he unbuckles his pants.

44:53.733 --> 44:57.903
What do you want me to say?
You've been flirting with me for months.

44:59.364 --> 45:02.908
-So what?
-So, l can't stop thinking about you.

45:03.868 --> 45:08.538
Because l'm new and different.
Or maybe l'm exactly the same.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.834
Tell me you've run past that stretch
of highway in the past two weeks

45:12.919 --> 45:14.795
and not thought of me,

45:15.630 --> 45:17.297
not looked for me.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.094
But then l have the luxury
of that last half-mile home

45:22.178 --> 45:25.806
where l go through every step of the future
until it ends.

45:26.349 --> 45:28.475
l know exactly how it ends.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.477
So what?

45:32.480 --> 45:35.857
You live two miles from here.
Your daughter was my student.

45:35.942 --> 45:38.360
l've seen your wife in the market.

45:38.569 --> 45:41.655
l don't think
you've done this before this way.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.125
l want you.

45:54.794 --> 45:58.588
l don't care. Doesn't that mean anything
to someone like you?
