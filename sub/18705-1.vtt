03:03.000 --> 03:06.749
When'd you buy these? They're beautiful.

03:07.463 --> 03:09.539
Bed sheets.

03:09.632 --> 03:14.377
- So where are the drapes? On your bed?
- Gotta try to find the second life in things.

03:14.470 --> 03:18.420
- How's your school?
- Good. Hard.

03:18.516 --> 03:21.470
- I would love to go back.
- So go!

03:21.561 --> 03:24.478
I think it's a little late in the game, no?

03:25.148 --> 03:29.525
School would be a piece of cake
compared to what you've been through.

03:29.611 --> 03:32.612
Thank God for this one, huh?

03:32.697 --> 03:36.232
She saved our lives, this little girl.
She really did.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.618
- How you doin', Rosie?
- Hi, Jimmy.

03:38.703 --> 03:41.241
Hey, little girl.

03:41.331 --> 03:43.573
Hey, little girl. Big girl.

03:44.751 --> 03:48.666
- What's up?
- Rosie's gonna sit for Corinna, study here.

03:49.423 --> 03:52.590
- Tonight?
- Yeah, we got the meeting.

03:54.136 --> 03:57.172
I caught the one by work. The nooner.

03:57.264 --> 03:59.423
We were supposed to go tonight.

03:59.516 --> 04:03.597
Yeah, but I gotta go to Albany tomorrow.
I gotta check out that body shop.

04:03.687 --> 04:07.103
I think it's better when we go together,
don't you?

04:07.775 --> 04:08.973
Huh..

04:09.068 --> 04:11.191
Jimmy fucked up?

04:12.655 --> 04:14.897
How much I owe?

04:14.991 --> 04:17.482
Gimme a dollar.

04:17.607 --> 04:19.653
OK.

04:20.370 --> 04:23.491
You go to the meeting. I'll watch the baby.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.868
- Sorry, Rosie. OK?
- No big thing.

04:26.961 --> 04:29.915
We'll pay you half for comin' downstairs.

04:43.270 --> 04:45.309
Come on.

04:45.397 --> 04:47.935
- Come on.
- Jimmy!

04:48.984 --> 04:51.060
- Jimmy!
- Here you go.

04:53.322 --> 04:55.398
Jimmy!

04:56.367 --> 04:57.909
Shh!

04:58.035 --> 05:01.700
- Jimmy, I'm a fuckin' dead man!
- What are you doin' here, Ronnie?

05:01.789 --> 05:07.543
I got 8 cars on a carrier. Boat's leavin' in
90 minutes & no driver. I need your help.

05:08.879 --> 05:13.209
You are not listening to me, OK? I can
go back to jail just for talkin' to you.

05:13.301 --> 05:15.839
I know. I know. I know, Jimmy.

05:15.928 --> 05:18.419
I know. I went to three guys before you.

05:18.514 --> 05:22.726
I know you don't want to be involved with
this shit.. and I respect that, Jimmy

05:22.810 --> 05:26.642
but I don't know what else to do.
You know who I have to answer to?

05:26.731 --> 05:28.937
Little Junior Brown.

05:29.025 --> 05:32.774
Ronnie, this is your problem.
I don't give a shit.

05:32.862 --> 05:36.397
Look what he did to my hand last week.
He thought I shorted him $50.

05:36.491 --> 05:41.533
Now I got $350,000 worth of this guy's cars
and no driver! I need your help here.

05:41.621 --> 05:43.947
Ronnie, I have a baby inside.

05:44.041 --> 05:46.199
Everybody respects this but you.

05:46.293 --> 05:48.535
Jimmy, you havin' a party?

05:48.629 --> 05:51.499
Jimmy, I know that.
But you gotta help me out.

05:51.590 --> 05:54.876
You cannot come to me
with this shit any more.

05:54.968 --> 05:56.427
- You gotta help me.
- Out.

05:56.512 --> 05:59.429
You know I love you, man.
I respect you, man.

05:59.515 --> 06:02.302
I'll give you $1500. We'll
be back in two hours.

06:02.393 --> 06:06.260
Ronnie, I don't want your fuckin' money.
Get outta here.

06:09.150 --> 06:12.400
You don't want my fuckin' money? Huh?

06:12.486 --> 06:15.156
I remember after your mom died.
You remember that?

06:15.239 --> 06:19.985
And your father used to go on his benders.
Whose people came to get you, man?

06:20.078 --> 06:22.782
Whose people came to get you?
Where'd you live?

06:22.872 --> 06:25.446
When you had no place to live,
where'd you live?

06:25.541 --> 06:29.919
- That was a long time ago.
- My family's never asked you for nothin'.

06:32.048 --> 06:35.215
Jimmy, I never asked you for nothin', man.

06:42.434 --> 06:47.511
Jimmy, this guy's gonna cripple me, man.
He's gonna cripple me.

06:47.606 --> 06:50.891
I'm your blood cousin, Jimmy.
I'm your blood cousin.

06:50.984 --> 06:53.060
It'll take two hours, man.

06:53.153 --> 06:58.942
Please don't let this happen.
Please don't let this fuckin' guy
hurt me. He's gonna kill me!

06:59.034 --> 07:03.613
The babysitter from upstairs, get her down.
It'll take two hours. Pay her double.

07:03.706 --> 07:05.782
Please, Jimmy. Please..

07:08.252 --> 07:10.328
Please.

07:17.220 --> 07:20.553
- Hey. I wake your parents up?
- Don't worry about it.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.131
- OK. I should be back in two hours.
- OK.

07:23.226 --> 07:25.302
- Thanks.
- Sure.

07:53.674 --> 07:58.087
Since you went away, man, we got big, man.
No more smash-and-grab bullshit.

07:58.178 --> 08:03.173
You know I got a half-size difference in my
shoes and gotta put three insoles in the left?

08:03.267 --> 08:06.470
Now when I see some shoes I want,
I buy two pairs - 10Â½ and 11.

08:06.562 --> 08:10.726
- I'm talkin' $300, $400 kicks.
- I don't give a fuck about your shoes.

08:10.816 --> 08:12.359
Mr. Jimmy!

08:12.443 --> 08:16.227
I'm talkin' $200, $300 kicks.
When you want back in, you let me..

08:21.327 --> 08:23.534
You playin' time games with me?

08:23.621 --> 08:28.034
Whoa. Junior, I'm your man.
It's gonna happen.

08:29.502 --> 08:31.578
Remove the fucking hand.

08:35.049 --> 08:40.091
I'm your guy, Junior. I'm here.
There's no problem. Let's just do it.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.422
You're here, huh?

08:45.143 --> 08:47.219
He's here!

08:48.272 --> 08:50.348
We're saved

08:52.359 --> 08:55.313
Come on, Junior, man. It's not my fault.

08:56.196 --> 08:58.272
What the fuck, man?

08:59.283 --> 09:01.359
He's a drunk, man!

09:02.286 --> 09:05.869
Look who showed up to drive.
He's fuckin' socked.

09:32.734 --> 09:35.651
Half now. He'll throw you the rest after.

09:35.737 --> 09:38.228
No stagger. Just haul ass!

09:41.034 --> 09:44.118
No stagger?
We'll look like a circus train!

09:47.457 --> 09:49.783
Fuckin' gorilla.

09:49.876 --> 09:53.376
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Jim, what are you doin'?

09:53.464 --> 09:57.758
We can't leave a guy like this.
They'll cut his throat around here.

09:58.385 --> 10:00.461
So? Good.

10:02.306 --> 10:05.509
You know what your problem is?
You're a liberal.

10:07.686 --> 10:09.763
Ready? Let's go. Let's go!

10:09.939 --> 10:12.015
I got a boat waitin'!

11:01.867 --> 11:03.943
Where.. Where's my money?

11:04.036 --> 11:06.112
Shut up.

11:27.727 --> 11:30.135
What happened? What happened?

11:30.939 --> 11:33.690
- Who took my goddamn money?
- I said shut up!

12:13.316 --> 12:14.514
Shit!

12:20.073 --> 12:23.074
- Step out of the truck.
- What's the problem?

12:23.159 --> 12:26.195
No problem. Just step out
of the truck, please.

12:26.996 --> 12:30.033
- Slowly. Slowly.
- OK, I'm slow. Watch my hand.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.201
Keep your hands up.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.250
What's goin' on? Hey!

12:35.338 --> 12:38.173
Somebody think
I'm stupid or somethin'?

12:41.678 --> 12:45.343
- Hey, fellas. How you doin'?
- Hey. What's up?

12:45.432 --> 12:47.555
Mind if I see your manifest?

12:58.153 --> 13:00.395
Who took my goddamn money?

13:01.615 --> 13:04.901
You wanna step down
outta the cab, please?

13:09.540 --> 13:11.414
No!

13:12.001 --> 13:14.373
- Get him!
- Shit!

13:23.471 --> 13:25.677
- Run! Run!
- Go!

13:25.765 --> 13:27.046
Go!

13:30.603 --> 13:32.679
- Move your hand.
- No, no!

13:45.077 --> 13:47.153
Bev..

13:47.663 --> 13:51.411
- There was no need for a medevac on this.
- My man is down!

13:51.500 --> 13:54.169
- You had no authority.
- Kiss my fuckin' ass!

13:55.712 --> 13:57.954
You watch Calvin, all right?

14:02.720 --> 14:05.389
Let me handle this.

14:12.188 --> 14:14.264
Wow!

14:16.442 --> 14:18.518
Does that hurt?

14:18.611 --> 14:22.312
- What are you doing?
- Who are the mutts that took off?

14:22.407 --> 14:24.814
No, no, no. You calm down, OK?

14:24.909 --> 14:27.614
Hey, chill out. The DA.

14:29.831 --> 14:31.907
That's him.

14:33.877 --> 14:35.205
Hey.

14:35.295 --> 14:37.371
I want the others.

14:39.799 --> 14:42.884
- I don't know 'em.
- What d'you think this is, huh?

14:42.969 --> 14:45.295
A possession of stolen property rap?

14:45.389 --> 14:48.923
Your partner's dead
and you're getting charged with murder.

14:49.017 --> 14:53.763
The shot cop..you're getting charged with
aggravated assault. You want air on this?

14:53.856 --> 14:56.228
Right now, give me some names.

14:56.316 --> 15:00.610
A guy called me, woke me up,
said he had a carrier for me to drive.

15:00.696 --> 15:02.772
He's gonna give me $1500.

15:02.865 --> 15:05.866
- Who called you?
- I don't know. Some guy.

15:05.951 --> 15:08.027
Some guy, huh?

15:09.288 --> 15:12.574
You know you're being charged
with felony murders?

15:12.667 --> 15:15.205
That's 30 for the body,
10 more for the felony.

15:15.461 --> 15:19.957
Do you think that the guy who called you,
if we had him here..

15:20.049 --> 15:22.967
do you think he'd do 40 years for you?

15:30.852 --> 15:33.390
Got a family?

15:41.488 --> 15:43.979
I don't know the guy.

15:44.116 --> 15:46.192
You did good, Jimmy.

15:46.284 --> 15:50.329
- Well, what else could you do?
- What else could I have done, Jack?

15:50.414 --> 15:55.621
I coulda done plenty. So they're
talkin' felony murder plus ten.
That's bullshit, right?

15:55.711 --> 15:58.546
They'll be happy with
a class two grand larceny.

15:58.630 --> 16:02.296
All that other shit, come on!
It's thunder without lightning.

16:02.384 --> 16:05.884
- Class two?
- Stolen property in excess of $75,000.

16:05.971 --> 16:09.008
You'll draw five years.
Serve three, maybe two.

16:13.020 --> 16:16.270
- Serve two?
- Look, you gotta take the hit.

16:16.357 --> 16:20.900
I mean, what can I tell you
that you don't already know?

16:20.987 --> 16:26.776
You did it, right? And they know that. It's
gonna be easy inside. It'll go like a dream.

16:26.868 --> 16:29.489
What happens to my family?

16:29.579 --> 16:32.913
Do you have any idea what
my wife and I have been through?

16:32.999 --> 16:35.075
Relax.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.741
We take care of our own.

16:43.510 --> 16:46.760
- $150?
- Yeah, every week, outta my own pocket.

16:46.847 --> 16:49.172
What the hell can I do with $150?

16:49.266 --> 16:53.727
Bev, it wasn't like he was pullin' down
weekly G's out there, you know?

16:53.812 --> 16:59.981
Let's be realistic. I'm not made
of money either. I'm just tryin'
to help out a little bit.

17:00.069 --> 17:02.310
I can't believe this.

17:05.907 --> 17:10.487
You know, Bev, there is another way
you could get it up a little bit.

17:12.373 --> 17:17.035
You know, if you worked for me at the
garage - you know what I'm sayin'..

17:17.127 --> 17:22.169
and, you know, like, run credit cards and
make appointments and stuff like that..

17:22.258 --> 17:25.259
It'd be.. you know, a strictly kosher gig.

17:26.262 --> 17:30.260
Come on, Bev. I mean, I owe him.
I owe him big time, all right?

17:30.350 --> 17:33.683
- Let me do this.
- What'd he do it for, Ronnie?

17:36.481 --> 17:38.806
Bev, I swear, I don't know.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.735
I mean, if that could be me in there..

17:47.951 --> 17:50.027
- Where's the baby?
- With Rosie.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.991
- How's she doin'?
- You know, she misses you.

18:03.759 --> 18:05.835
Number five!

18:12.727 --> 18:18.432
How could you do this? I can't make it
out there without you. I don't understand.

18:20.485 --> 18:23.818
Well, I felt I had.. no choice.

18:23.905 --> 18:26.396
They were gonna kill Ronnie.

18:28.159 --> 18:30.567
We were doing OK.

18:30.662 --> 18:33.117
Didn't you think we were doing OK?

18:36.418 --> 18:38.790
They doin' right by you?

18:39.671 --> 18:42.589
Doin' right by me? You're in jail, Jimmy.

18:46.011 --> 18:48.087
Number five!

18:52.935 --> 18:57.347
- Bobby, what's the deal with this?
- It needs an 80-amp alternator, 8417 belts.

18:57.439 --> 19:01.651
- Fuckin' thing snapped.
- We ain't got no more? OK, I'll buy some.

19:03.654 --> 19:06.323
- John, you cut the drums?
- Yeah, both of 'em.

19:06.407 --> 19:08.483
Good work.

19:22.548 --> 19:26.463
- Did the kid Terry call about the Chevys yet?
- Not yet.

19:26.552 --> 19:28.841
Let me know, all right?

19:29.889 --> 19:32.297
It's fuckin' hot.

19:34.602 --> 19:37.058
It's like Tijuana out here.

19:39.274 --> 19:41.646
Thanks. I don't drink.

19:43.111 --> 19:46.231
- Not no more, huh?
- Not no more.

19:47.115 --> 19:49.606
- There was a time, though, right?
- Right.

19:49.701 --> 19:55.491
Yeah, I remember. You & Jimmy. Used to
be, like, partyin' every night, right?

19:56.667 --> 19:59.122
Well, it wasn't that long ago.

20:01.839 --> 20:04.674
- Whaddaya want from me?
- Ronnie!

20:04.758 --> 20:06.834
Ronnie!

20:08.262 --> 20:10.338
Yo, Ronnie!

20:11.223 --> 20:12.931
Hey, come on!

20:16.229 --> 20:19.348
- What's the deal?
- Go ahead and ask him.

20:21.067 --> 20:24.851
- Ask him!
- Yo. I got a '93 Infinity.

20:24.946 --> 20:27.318
It's fully loaded. Fully loaded.

20:27.407 --> 20:30.361
- Oh, yeah? Is it yours?
- Yeah. Well, it is now.

20:30.952 --> 20:34.036
- Oh, yeah? Is that right?
- I heard you..

20:34.122 --> 20:38.036
You heard what?
I ain't got nothin' to do with hot cars.

20:38.126 --> 20:40.249
What the fuck you heard?

20:40.337 --> 20:43.291
I was in the joint with Vinny Passo.
He told me that..

20:43.381 --> 20:45.919
Who the fuck is Vinny Passo?

20:46.009 --> 20:49.627
And who the fuck are you?
I don't know you. Where you from?

20:49.721 --> 20:52.391
You know Vinny, right?

20:52.474 --> 20:55.012
- You a cop?
- No, man. I ain't no cop.

20:55.102 --> 20:57.391
I was.. I was in the joint with..

20:57.479 --> 21:00.433
We don't do that shit over here.
Motherfucker!

21:04.862 --> 21:06.938
Hold him, Johnny! Hold him.

21:08.449 --> 21:10.987
Come here! Where you goin'? Come here!

21:20.461 --> 21:22.620
What the fuck d'ya think this is?

21:22.714 --> 21:26.047
Get that car outta here! That one too.

21:31.639 --> 21:33.965
Closin' up! Out! Out!

21:36.978 --> 21:40.928
I'm fuckin' upset! So fuckin' upset!
I can't take this bullshit.

21:41.024 --> 21:44.025
Come on, I'm gonna
drive you home. Let's go.

21:44.111 --> 21:46.483
Let's go. Let me get this.

22:01.295 --> 22:04.794
- Where are we goin'?
- Come on. I gotta go see somebody.

22:05.716 --> 22:07.792
I'll buy you a soda pop, all right?

22:07.885 --> 22:09.961
24.

22:11.847 --> 22:14.173
25.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.508
Nice and easy.

22:16.602 --> 22:19.769
- 26.
- Jesus, what you been eatin'?

22:19.856 --> 22:22.347
Come on, you faggot. 27.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.434
- 28.
- Come on, Junior.

22:25.528 --> 22:27.604
29.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.856
- 30.
- Oh, fuck.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.025
31.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.911
A vodka straight. For her, whatever.

22:37.999 --> 22:40.573
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

22:43.588 --> 22:45.664
37.

22:46.258 --> 22:49.175
Pop! Pop! I'm goin' for forty.

22:49.261 --> 22:51.419
Watch!

22:51.513 --> 22:54.550
- 38.
- You got it. You got it. Come on!

22:54.641 --> 22:56.717
- 39.
- Come on!

22:56.810 --> 22:58.886
And..

22:58.979 --> 23:01.055
40!

23:01.690 --> 23:05.439
- He did it.
- That was great! I knew you had it in you.

23:13.869 --> 23:16.989
- What's due?
- It's all there.

23:20.168 --> 23:23.287
- Who's she?
- That's my cousin's wife.

23:25.590 --> 23:29.208
- You givin' her the money?
- Yeah. $400 a week like you said.

23:29.302 --> 23:32.718
Plus, I'm giving her a job.
You know, that was my idea.

23:36.518 --> 23:39.009
- Throw her a car too.
- A car?

23:39.104 --> 23:41.310
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

23:41.815 --> 23:43.891
Is that it?

23:44.609 --> 23:46.685
All right.

23:57.331 --> 23:59.407
Hey, what's the what?

23:59.500 --> 24:02.454
What kinda car you like to drive?

24:02.544 --> 24:04.751
- What kind?
- Yeah.

24:05.506 --> 24:07.380
Listen..

24:11.011 --> 24:12.838
I wanna give you a car.

24:12.930 --> 24:15.717
I wanna do somethin' nice for you.

24:17.977 --> 24:21.227
- You wanna do something nice for me?
- Yeah.

24:23.691 --> 24:26.478
- Feel good?
- My father says to take her home.

24:29.572 --> 24:33.155
- Why don't you let her finish her drink first?
- Now, fucko!

24:35.578 --> 24:40.122
- Why you gotta talk to me like that, man?
- To her house.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.415
Come on, let's go.

25:14.785 --> 25:17.822
Rosie, I'm sorry. I fell asleep.
Is Corinna OK?

25:19.415 --> 25:22.452
No, I'm coming home.
I'm coming home right now.

25:22.543 --> 25:24.619
OK.

25:30.510 --> 25:32.799
Oh, look who's up.

25:32.887 --> 25:34.963
Fuck off!

26:03.669 --> 26:05.377
Jimmy!

26:12.678 --> 26:14.754
Kilmartin.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.731
Come in. I'll be off in a minute.

26:37.954 --> 26:40.659
Oh, Bev, no! Oh, no..

26:44.544 --> 26:47.664
She was a beautiful person, man.

26:48.965 --> 26:51.042
I did everything I could for her.

26:52.553 --> 26:54.629
I'm sorry.

26:55.472 --> 26:59.850
What was she doin' in your car
at eight in the morning, Ronnie?

27:00.894 --> 27:04.643
I sent her from the shop
to get somethin' from my house.

27:05.691 --> 27:08.811
- We were workin'..
- To get what?

27:13.115 --> 27:15.404
To get my wallet.

27:17.328 --> 27:19.700
To get your wallet?

27:24.502 --> 27:29.164
Jimmy, I swear, if that could be me in there..
I wouldn't have done it, man, cos I..

27:29.257 --> 27:31.333
- Let's go.
- We were workin'.

27:31.426 --> 27:34.593
- Wait a second. Wait.
- Let's go.

27:34.679 --> 27:37.004
Could Rosie bring Corinna to see me?

27:37.182 --> 27:40.800
- You know, it was you, drivin' that truck.
- Don't say that.

27:40.894 --> 27:43.599
Now I got nobody.

27:43.688 --> 27:46.262
Come on. Time to go.

27:49.486 --> 27:52.570
On the morning she died,
what time did Bev go to work?

27:52.656 --> 27:56.440
- I'm.. not sure.
- Rosie, let me put it to you another way.

27:56.535 --> 28:00.615
What time did you come downstairs so she
could go to work? Six A.M.., seven A.M.?

28:00.706 --> 28:02.782
Ah, Jimmy..

28:08.589 --> 28:11.958
She never even made it home
from the night before.

28:14.053 --> 28:19.213
She called me from work, says Ronnie's
drivin' her, but she never made it.

28:19.308 --> 28:21.799
Jimmy, she never made it.

28:21.894 --> 28:25.643
- Ronnie.
- I was there all night. All night long.

28:25.732 --> 28:28.223
- Ronnie.
- Let's go.

28:30.945 --> 28:32.487
OK.

28:34.949 --> 28:39.030
- Your wallet, Ronnie? Your wallet?
- Come on!

28:39.955 --> 28:40.986
Come on!

28:41.081 --> 28:44.781
- Now you're giving me names?
- You want 'em or not?

28:44.876 --> 28:46.999
What do you want? Early parole?

28:47.087 --> 28:51.714
If I give people up to you and you turn me
loose early, I won't last day one out there.

28:51.800 --> 28:55.418
- So what do you want?
- I wanna visit my daughter.

28:58.599 --> 29:03.012
She's livin' upstate with my mother-in-law,
who won't let her come and see me.

29:03.103 --> 29:07.148
And I want a one-day trip
to go up there and see her. One day.

29:13.114 --> 29:16.031
- No.
- Whaddaya want from me?

29:17.535 --> 29:20.287
What do you mean? Like, in addition?

29:21.289 --> 29:23.780
Tell me something. Surprise me.

29:28.338 --> 29:30.793
Astro Jewelers. Remember that?

29:31.591 --> 29:34.426
- Four years ago.
- Mm-hm.

29:34.886 --> 29:37.638
I give you those people, I get my day.

29:40.308 --> 29:42.634
We'll see.

29:44.896 --> 29:47.103
John Amato. Call him Johnny A.

29:47.190 --> 29:50.026
And Bobby Bannion: Bobby B.

29:50.110 --> 29:52.731
They work at L&M Automotive
near Shea Stadium.

29:52.821 --> 29:55.822
- Anybody else?
- You should pick me up too.

29:55.908 --> 29:58.862
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- Well, if you don't..

29:58.952 --> 30:01.278
they'll know who did the talking.

30:02.331 --> 30:05.202
So, throw me in a line-up.
I'll take my chances.

30:05.751 --> 30:08.325
That's all I have to say about this.

30:12.049 --> 30:15.252
Tell me about the navy yard.

30:16.596 --> 30:20.463
Same guys: Johnny A, Bobby B and me.

30:20.558 --> 30:24.176
That's three. There were four transporters.

30:28.483 --> 30:32.528
I didn't know the fourth driver.
I never saw him before.

30:32.612 --> 30:34.901
Who called you?

30:38.785 --> 30:42.035
Yo.. Mr. Money.

30:44.291 --> 30:49.665
There is no way that you can tell me that you
did not know the guy who got you into this.

30:52.507 --> 30:55.045
Look me in the eye and try it.

30:58.889 --> 31:01.973
I've got no reason to lie.

31:04.478 --> 31:07.183
Everybody's got a reason to lie.

31:09.150 --> 31:11.985
Astro Jewelers? That was four years ago.

31:12.069 --> 31:14.477
Who ratted us out?

31:14.572 --> 31:17.526
Well, whoever it was, you're in the clear.

31:17.617 --> 31:22.160
I was the driver. The guy never laid eyes
on me. Did they pick Ronnie up too?

31:23.706 --> 31:27.075
- Ronnie Gannon?
- Yeah. The whole job was his idea.

31:27.168 --> 31:30.205
No, his name didn't even come up.

31:30.296 --> 31:33.582
Did the prosecutor's office
contact you about this?

31:33.675 --> 31:37.673
No. How stupid do ya think I am?
I wouldn't talk to anybody without you.

31:40.307 --> 31:44.684
Yeah. Well, they also got picked up
on the navy yard thing.

31:44.769 --> 31:47.687
- Who did?
- Bobby and Johnny.

31:48.398 --> 31:50.687
Ronnie too?

31:53.612 --> 31:57.479
- Ronnie Gannon..
- I never liked that kid.

31:57.574 --> 32:00.528
He's a fuckin' rat, is what you're sayin'.

32:00.619 --> 32:05.661
You gonna take care of this,
Junior, or are you goin' outta house?

32:06.417 --> 32:08.990
I clean up my own mess.

32:41.328 --> 32:44.198
- You ever see a Rolls get chopped?
- No.

32:44.289 --> 32:47.160
Why don't you stay and check it out?

32:49.211 --> 32:52.627
Come on, man.
I'm dyin' over here. Let's go!

32:55.884 --> 33:01.923
We ain't got all day, man. Let's go, man. It
ain't rocket science. Let's get outta here!

33:05.978 --> 33:10.272
Let's go to work. Let's get it up!

33:12.234 --> 33:14.310
Yo, Ronnie!

33:14.403 --> 33:17.238
Ronnie! Come here!

33:36.259 --> 33:40.423
What the fuck?
You guys look like the Gorton's fishermen.

33:43.308 --> 33:45.633
Ronnie, I want you to listen to this.

33:45.727 --> 33:48.598
An oldie but goodie.

33:48.689 --> 33:51.559
Concentrate on the words.

34:01.952 --> 34:04.277
Did ya hear that?

34:04.371 --> 34:07.206
Yeah. The bass was too heavy, though.

34:10.210 --> 34:14.789
"The time has come for everyone
to clean up their own back yard."

34:18.427 --> 34:21.879
"Clean up their own back yard."

34:22.514 --> 34:24.175
Did you hear that?

34:24.266 --> 34:27.434
Wait! What'd I do?

34:27.520 --> 34:29.596
I didn't do nothin'! What'd I do?

34:32.108 --> 34:35.857
You got somethin' to say?
You like to talk to the cops, huh?

34:35.945 --> 34:38.021
Huh?

34:38.657 --> 34:42.025
You like to fuckin' talk, you fuck?
You fuck!

34:59.762 --> 35:01.635
Shit, Junior.

35:01.722 --> 35:03.845
- Shit.
- Ow.

35:06.393 --> 35:08.469
I like this. I really do.

35:16.862 --> 35:19.899
Ah, man, look at this. I
just bought this thing.

35:34.005 --> 35:36.330
Let's get him outta here.

35:55.652 --> 35:59.401
- Kilmartin. On a day pass.
- Change your clothes in the cage.

36:07.873 --> 36:11.040
Mr. Kilmartin. We meet again.

36:12.253 --> 36:15.373
You remember old Calvin
Hart here, don't ya?

36:20.052 --> 36:22.128
He sure as shit remembers you.

37:00.469 --> 37:02.758
Take the cuffs off him.

37:09.812 --> 37:11.888
Took the same bullet as you.

37:47.184 --> 37:49.675
Can I see my daughter now?

38:15.713 --> 38:17.871
- Hi.
- What happened to your face?

38:17.965 --> 38:21.833
Nothin'. Listen,
I don't think this is such a good idea.

38:21.928 --> 38:24.253
I don't want her to see me like this.

38:24.847 --> 38:27.255
Oh, Jimmy, she's a baby. She don't..

38:36.609 --> 38:39.776
- She ask for Bev a lot?
- In and out.

38:39.863 --> 38:43.528
Between me and Bev's mom,
she's doin' better than you think.

38:43.617 --> 38:48.029
I've been takin' her to classes with me.
She likes psych and economics.

38:48.121 --> 38:50.197
Math..

38:50.749 --> 38:54.996
That's great. I don't know
what I'd do without you, Rosie.

39:07.266 --> 39:09.342
Corinna.

39:18.778 --> 39:20.106
Hey.

39:20.196 --> 39:22.817
Hey, you! Hey.

39:25.118 --> 39:28.284
Hey, you, come here.
Corinna, do you know who I am?

39:28.371 --> 39:30.660
Just for one minute.

39:33.042 --> 39:35.118
I know.

39:36.629 --> 39:38.706
Ma-ma-ma..

39:41.301 --> 39:43.377
OK. All right.

39:50.769 --> 39:53.141
Don't take her away from me.

40:13.417 --> 40:16.087
Daddy, it stinks in here.

40:17.004 --> 40:19.376
It smells like soup!

40:22.009 --> 40:24.465
Soup, huh?

40:24.554 --> 40:26.630
Three more weeks.

40:26.723 --> 40:29.510
Hang in there, kiddo.

40:29.601 --> 40:31.427
Yeah..

40:31.519 --> 40:34.639
Comin' out to what? No job, no money..

40:36.191 --> 40:39.061
Least I got you, Juicy, right? Yeah.

40:39.611 --> 40:42.647
I wanna get your parents somethin'
for getting my apartment back.

40:42.739 --> 40:46.025
- And you got me.
- Whaddaya mean, I got you?

41:01.467 --> 41:03.009
Give it up!

41:03.093 --> 41:06.794
Kilmartin, report to the
five building bypass.

41:06.889 --> 41:08.716
Kilmartin!

41:31.331 --> 41:33.407
Come on in.

41:46.888 --> 41:50.838
I hear you're comin' up
for parole review next week.

41:50.934 --> 41:54.019
I also hear you've been a pretty good guy.
That's great.

41:54.104 --> 41:56.180
Whaddaya want?

41:58.025 --> 42:03.019
Did you ever hear of an asshole
by the name of Little Junior Brown?

42:08.827 --> 42:10.904
Think.

42:11.622 --> 42:13.247
What about him?

42:16.836 --> 42:18.496
Little Junior..

42:18.588 --> 42:21.624
His old man, Big Junior?

42:21.716 --> 42:24.421
He's in the hospital. He ain't comin' out.

42:25.178 --> 42:28.760
So it looks like Little Junior's
movin' up in the world.

42:30.892 --> 42:32.968
Big Junior.

42:33.061 --> 42:37.059
That's one of those expressions like..
jumbo shrimp.

42:37.857 --> 42:39.933
Huh?

42:43.113 --> 42:45.355
Listen to me.

42:45.448 --> 42:49.612
I am not goin' back to that.
I am not rattin' on anybody else.

42:49.703 --> 42:52.455
What's done is done.
You can't make me do shit.

42:52.539 --> 42:55.624
We never swung the hammer on you
for the Astro job.

42:55.709 --> 42:58.995
Get the indictment on me.
Look, all I got to say to you..

42:59.087 --> 43:03.132
is how you already cooperated with us
ratting out the others..

43:03.217 --> 43:07.345
and here we are droppin' it on you anyhow
because you won't do any more ratting.

43:07.429 --> 43:09.920
You know what? You're right.

43:10.015 --> 43:13.598
Forget it.
We probably won't get the indictment.

43:15.187 --> 43:17.725
And you'll be out on the street.

43:19.233 --> 43:21.807
A free man.

43:21.903 --> 43:26.066
How long do you think you're gonna
last out there once the word gets out?

43:32.372 --> 43:34.448
Are you a man of honor?

43:35.959 --> 43:38.035
Sure.

43:38.712 --> 43:40.788
See, let me tell you.

43:41.673 --> 43:48.672
All I want now is what I had in my life before
all the fuckers came through the door..

43:48.764 --> 43:50.840
you and them.

43:51.683 --> 43:56.226
I wanna be left alone with my family,
and I want a job that feels good to me.

43:56.313 --> 44:00.145
So if that means I need to deliver up
this Junior Brown, I'll do that.

44:00.234 --> 44:03.817
If I have to kill this
motherfucker to get there, I will.

44:03.904 --> 44:06.360
But all I've got on you is your word.

44:06.448 --> 44:09.366
So I'm asking you: if I serve him up..

44:10.786 --> 44:17.204
as a man of honor, will you say to me now
that you will cut me loose once and for all?

44:18.544 --> 44:20.620
Absolutely.

44:21.714 --> 44:24.501
D'you want my hand on it or something?

44:38.898 --> 44:40.974
OK, let him pass.

44:55.791 --> 44:57.867
James Kilmartin.

44:57.960 --> 45:00.332
- Rose D'Amico.
- Here.

45:00.963 --> 45:03.288
That's my daddy!

45:05.175 --> 45:07.251
Let's go.

45:21.943 --> 45:24.019
- Daddy, look!
- Hey, Corinna!

45:25.696 --> 45:29.113
What the hell's the matter with you?!

45:31.661 --> 45:34.413
The car almost hit me, Daddy.

45:34.497 --> 45:36.573
I know.

45:46.927 --> 45:50.509
- What the fuck is your problem, man?
- My father's dead!

45:50.847 --> 45:52.923
My father's dead!

45:54.434 --> 45:56.890
Come on, get it out. Come on.

46:00.858 --> 46:02.103
Argh!

46:37.103 --> 46:39.594
See the brother here with Junior?

46:39.689 --> 46:44.351
His name's Omar. Now, Omar's down
with some posse outta Philadelphia.

46:44.444 --> 46:49.023
Must got cash as long as train smoke
cos he's Junior's biggest customer.

46:49.116 --> 46:53.861
Cars, drugs, guns. He's buyin'
everything he can get his hands on.

46:54.496 --> 46:59.407
So when you hook up
with your scumbag pals,
I want you to get 'em talkin' about Omar.

46:59.501 --> 47:03.084
He must be new. The Philadelphia PD
ain't got no jacket on him yet.

47:03.172 --> 47:05.248
Wait.

47:05.966 --> 47:08.837
Fuck this guy Omar. You said Little Junior.

47:08.928 --> 47:11.216
This is about Little Junior.

47:12.348 --> 47:17.888
Look, like if you get in some
conversations, just relax.
Don't push for nothin', all right?

47:17.979 --> 47:22.973
Guy starts talkin', just ask for
more details, but nice and natural.

47:23.067 --> 47:25.143
Two assholes talkin' shop.

47:25.236 --> 47:30.479
But don't push, all right?
And don't initiate nothin', all right?

47:33.912 --> 47:37.031
Yeah, you gonna be fine. Just fine.

47:38.124 --> 47:40.794
Look, we in this together, man.

47:40.877 --> 47:43.249
One for all, all for one, right?

47:52.055 --> 47:54.427
OK, slow down. Slow.

47:57.769 --> 48:00.724
There it is. There. The Lexus, right there.

49:11.387 --> 49:15.135
I hate dogs! Little dogs, big dogs..

49:15.224 --> 49:17.300
Let's get outta here.

49:41.251 --> 49:43.658
See that guy in the red shirt over there?

49:44.921 --> 49:48.586
- This guy right over here?
- That's our connect in the DMV.

49:49.134 --> 49:53.926
Alls we gotta do is throw him a license
number, throws us back anything we need.

49:54.014 --> 49:57.846
Sometimes we got more shit
than the real owners. It's beautiful.

49:57.935 --> 49:59.892
No kiddin'.

50:00.104 --> 50:02.180
No kiddin'.

50:14.660 --> 50:18.029
Now, you see her? The Indian?
I just love her.

50:18.122 --> 50:21.705
- She's nice.
- No, I love her. We're engaged.

50:22.752 --> 50:27.129
I wanna grow old with her and shit.
You know what I'm tryin' to say?

50:34.472 --> 50:37.557
You remember me?

50:37.642 --> 50:39.718
Yeah.

50:46.151 --> 50:48.938
I heard you lost your wife.

50:49.321 --> 50:51.776
I lost my father last week.

50:55.786 --> 50:58.359
Whaddaya think is worse?

50:58.455 --> 51:00.946
Losin' a wife or losin' a father?

51:03.961 --> 51:06.037
I don't know.

51:07.131 --> 51:11.425
I guess it depends on the individual,
the relationship, whatnot.

51:14.305 --> 51:17.306
You know what an
asthma attack feels like?

51:19.435 --> 51:23.433
Feels like you're tryin' to breathe air
through a flattened straw.

51:23.523 --> 51:28.149
But if I take a hit of
this, most times I'm OK.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.562
Like that.

51:31.573 --> 51:34.242
But my old man?

51:34.325 --> 51:36.401
In the end?

51:39.914 --> 51:43.533
He had less than five per cent
of his lung capacity.

51:47.589 --> 51:50.507
I mean.. he went out hard.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.711
I'm sorry to hear that.

51:55.889 --> 52:00.385
If that starts happenin' with me, with
genetics and shit, it's silver-bullet time.

52:00.477 --> 52:02.636
I'll do it myself.

52:08.027 --> 52:10.897
At least your wife, she
went out fast, right?

52:12.323 --> 52:16.155
I'm tellin' ya, man,
you gotta be grateful for that.

52:17.703 --> 52:20.408
So, Sing Sing.. You got through that.

52:24.085 --> 52:27.454
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, right?

52:27.547 --> 52:28.578
Whatever..?

52:28.673 --> 52:31.081
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

52:31.342 --> 52:33.964
Whatever don't kill you makes..

52:34.053 --> 52:36.129
I like that.

52:39.476 --> 52:42.393
- You're OK.
- Joey, get this guy!

52:42.479 --> 52:45.812
- You're all right.
- Hey!

52:45.899 --> 52:48.900
- What are you doin'? Come here.
- Hey, man. Come on!

52:48.985 --> 52:51.274
Bring him here.

52:57.327 --> 53:00.779
Junior, I'm drunk. I was drunk. I'm sorry.

53:00.873 --> 53:03.364
Which hand did you grab her with?

53:04.418 --> 53:08.001
Put it on the table.
I'm only gonna say that once.

53:15.429 --> 53:19.012
Would you mind lightin'
one of those for me, please?

53:39.704 --> 53:41.578
- Thank you.
- Junior..

53:41.665 --> 53:44.784
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

53:45.627 --> 53:48.581
You think that's an easy job,
dancin' up there?

53:48.672 --> 53:52.123
It's hard, what they do.
Are you kiddin' me?

53:52.217 --> 53:55.752
- Junior..
- Don't you move that fuckin' hand.

53:56.763 --> 53:59.848
When someone steps over the line..

53:59.933 --> 54:04.346
the difficult becomes
the repulsively impossible.

54:05.189 --> 54:08.772
I think you should have more respect
for what they put up with.

54:08.859 --> 54:11.350
So what can I do..

54:12.404 --> 54:14.978
to make you remember..

54:15.074 --> 54:18.609
and appreciate..

54:19.453 --> 54:22.822
what that's like, bein' up there?

54:26.961 --> 54:29.037
Please..

54:39.432 --> 54:41.508
Come here.

54:41.685 --> 54:43.761
Come on, come on.

54:44.854 --> 54:46.931
Get over here!

55:04.375 --> 55:09.250
Tonight, I'll tell you, you have really
got this thing down to a science.

55:09.338 --> 55:11.414
Yeah? What thing?

55:11.507 --> 55:14.627
Well, look at him.
Who would know? Am I right?

55:18.055 --> 55:20.546
Who would know what?

55:22.101 --> 55:25.850
No, I'm just.. I'm just saying. You know.

55:25.938 --> 55:28.180
Admirin'.

55:28.274 --> 55:30.066
Admirin'?

55:50.088 --> 55:52.710
Get him the fuck off there.

56:08.607 --> 56:12.771
I am so fuckin' stupid.
I should have my fuckin' head examined.

56:13.821 --> 56:16.692
What is the matter with me?

56:28.503 --> 56:30.910
Hey! Hey! What are you fuckin' doin'?

56:31.005 --> 56:34.255
What are you worrying
about the guy for, huh?!

56:35.176 --> 56:37.548
What guy? What fucking guy?

56:38.805 --> 56:40.881
Whaddaya wanna know for?

56:40.974 --> 56:43.761
That's fucking great.
I did three years for you.

56:43.852 --> 56:45.928
Hey, hey, hey.

56:46.396 --> 56:49.812
I did three years for you,
you paranoid motherfucker, OK?

56:49.900 --> 56:52.901
Full time, not a day less, for you.

56:52.986 --> 56:55.062
OK?

56:55.697 --> 56:58.319
What do you wanna know
about the guy for?

57:01.829 --> 57:05.661
JJ pointed him out to me,
like 2 minutes before you sat down.

57:05.749 --> 57:11.289
If he's got a big fuckin' mouth,
take it up with him. I was tryin'
to make conversation.

57:20.222 --> 57:22.630
It's been a hard week.

57:25.394 --> 57:28.431
I'm sorry. I just lost
control, you know, so..

57:29.816 --> 57:31.524
Wanna go for a ride?

57:31.609 --> 57:33.649
Let's go for a ride. Come on.

57:33.736 --> 57:35.812
No problem.

57:39.951 --> 57:42.027
Know what an acronym is?

57:45.999 --> 57:51.954
It's like letters that stand for things.
You know, like FBI, TGIF. You understand?

57:52.881 --> 57:54.957
Yeah.

57:56.385 --> 58:00.003
I have an acronym for myself.
Know what it is?

58:02.808 --> 58:06.177
B-A-D.

58:07.271 --> 58:13.808
B-A-D. Balls, attitude, direction.

58:16.530 --> 58:21.442
You should give yourself an acronym.
Cos it helps you visualize your goals.

58:24.664 --> 58:28.412
How about F-A-B? Fucked at birth.

58:32.922 --> 58:34.879
No good. Too negative.

58:45.268 --> 58:48.684
There's a bag in the trunk.
Why don't ya get it?

59:08.125 --> 59:10.118
Whoa! Omar.

59:10.211 --> 59:13.081
Don't you be fuckin'
sneakin' up on me like that.

59:13.172 --> 59:16.921
Shit! Maybe you oughta
lighten up on the yeyo some.

59:18.052 --> 59:19.795
And you think I'm paranoid..

59:19.887 --> 59:22.841
- Who the fuck is this?
- He's cool. He's my people.

59:22.932 --> 59:25.803
Your people?
Turn the fuck around, motherfucker.

59:25.893 --> 59:27.969
Omar, the cars.

59:32.483 --> 59:35.437
Yeah, man. You got the titles and shit?

59:35.528 --> 59:37.604
Always do.

59:39.491 --> 59:43.073
All right, I'll take 'em all.
Except that Explorer.

59:43.828 --> 59:46.236
What's the matter with the Explorer?

59:47.165 --> 59:49.241
It's..

59:50.752 --> 59:52.828
It's red.

59:53.630 --> 59:56.382
- So have 'em paint it.
- No. No, man.

59:56.466 --> 59:59.752
No, it'd still be red under the paint.

01:00:00.345 --> 01:00:04.011
Red's my bad luck color.
I ain't got nothin' to do with red.

01:00:06.977 --> 01:00:09.515
You're some funny people, my man.

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:14.478
- You got them nines for me?
- Right here.

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.688
Are you interested in Macs?
I'll get you a dozen.

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:24.453
Macs? Yeah, man. I'll take Macs. Yeah.

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:26.613
You got 'em.

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.582
This motherfucker smells scared, Junior.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.923
I don't like that.

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:40.500
You wanna dance with me?

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:47.518
Cos I love to dance.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.891
You hear what I'm sayin'?

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:53.222
No more new fuckin' faces, all right?

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.607
Whatever.

01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:23.885
How about you? You afraid of red?

01:01:24.432 --> 01:01:27.349
What am I, an interior decorator?
I don't give a shit.

01:01:27.435 --> 01:01:29.724
Good. The Explorer's yours.

01:02:06.767 --> 01:02:09.139
Jimmy. Over here.

01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:19.525
These are the cars we took.

01:02:19.614 --> 01:02:22.615
Where'd they go?
Terminator Body Parts?

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:23.898
Got anything else?

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.780
There was a guy from the DMV there.
I couldn't get his name.

01:02:26.871 --> 01:02:29.658
Yeah, we onto him.
So you hook up with Junior?

01:02:29.749 --> 01:02:30.780
Oh, yeah.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:33.995
- And how about Omar? You cut in Omar?
- Him too.

01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:39.461
Bought everything on the sheet,
bag of nines, goin' for a dozen
Macs over the weekend.

01:02:39.551 --> 01:02:41.378
All right.

01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:44.589
- So I'll get that wire off you.
- I threw it away.

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:46.801
What?

01:02:46.892 --> 01:02:50.343
I threw it away.
I got patted down twice tonight.

01:02:52.564 --> 01:02:55.399
So you're all right with him.
That'll make it easier.

01:02:55.484 --> 01:02:59.102
- Easier for what?
- Easier to wear a fuckin' wire.

01:03:01.698 --> 01:03:04.865
Let me ask you a question.
Why you?

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:08.489
Why did they put you on me?
Revenge?

01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:11.454
You see this eye here?

01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:14.745
Runs all the time. I can't make it stop.

01:03:14.837 --> 01:03:17.672
I got a third of my hearin' in this ear.

01:03:17.757 --> 01:03:22.300
When I wanna go to the beach, take my kids
to the beach and play with 'em and shit..

01:03:22.386 --> 01:03:26.515
strong, direct sun gives me a migraine
so bad, I cry like a baby.

01:03:26.599 --> 01:03:29.434
They don't know why. It just does.

01:03:30.103 --> 01:03:32.510
So I asked for you.

01:03:33.439 --> 01:03:39.193
And if you take that wire off one more time,
I'm personally gonna beat you to death.

01:03:41.072 --> 01:03:45.734
Maybe the next time you lay a hand on me
it won't be such a one-way beatin'.

01:03:55.087 --> 01:03:57.126
Hi.

01:04:01.343 --> 01:04:03.632
What you got, a test?

01:04:05.848 --> 01:04:08.553
Are you gonna get locked up again?

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:11.934
No.

01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:15.224
- You would never do that to me.
- No.

01:04:15.316 --> 01:04:18.021
Cos I'm not Bev. I can't live with that.

01:04:23.157 --> 01:04:25.565
She couldn't live with it either.

01:04:48.683 --> 01:04:51.850
You got something you need to tell me?

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:01.315
I'm under the rock.
They got me wearin' a wire.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:10.575
Funny thing is,
I liked boostin' cars, you know?

01:05:10.664 --> 01:05:14.199
There wasn't any make or model
I couldn't pop the lock.

01:05:14.585 --> 01:05:18.453
Kill the alarm,
get it on the road in 90 seconds.

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:23.799
And it felt good.
It felt good to be good at somethin'.

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:28.216
I had money in my pocket,
nice clothes, flash ride..

01:05:32.478 --> 01:05:35.894
Buy things for Bev, you know?
Take her places.

01:05:38.943 --> 01:05:41.019
Felt good.

01:05:43.949 --> 01:05:46.237
But it was bullshit.

01:05:47.619 --> 01:05:51.831
And when I finally got caught..
goin' to jail..

01:05:53.542 --> 01:05:55.784
That's for real.

01:05:57.796 --> 01:06:01.046
DA's office, Wednesday, 8 P.M..

01:06:01.133 --> 01:06:03.754
Mrs. Wang's restaurant, wiring subject.

01:06:09.683 --> 01:06:12.601
Switch the ID plate with the junker's.
Torch the junker.

01:06:12.686 --> 01:06:14.762
Cops'll think it's the new car.

01:06:48.932 --> 01:06:50.426
Let's go.

01:06:50.517 --> 01:06:52.177
Wait.

01:06:56.565 --> 01:06:57.763
Ooh!

01:06:57.858 --> 01:07:01.690
I always get such a kick outta that.
It's the kid in me.

01:07:18.713 --> 01:07:20.705
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:07:20.798 --> 01:07:23.503
Ugh! You smell like gasoline.

01:07:23.593 --> 01:07:26.297
He's a workin' man, babe. Give him a break.

01:07:30.808 --> 01:07:32.267
- I gotta go.
- Where?

01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:34.973
Gotta get home. She'll have my ass. So..

01:07:41.695 --> 01:07:43.771
Let's go.

01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:49.982
What's up?

01:07:50.078 --> 01:07:54.491
You don't know who to fucking trust
these days. Know what I mean?

01:07:59.838 --> 01:08:01.795
Junior, what?

01:08:01.882 --> 01:08:04.254
What's up? I do somethin'?

01:08:19.734 --> 01:08:23.731
Walk over there
and ask him if he wants a Rolls.

01:08:23.821 --> 01:08:25.694
Tell him it's red.

01:08:26.032 --> 01:08:28.653
Oh, come on, Junior.
Don't make me do that.

01:08:34.415 --> 01:08:36.988
And come up on the passenger side.

01:09:03.403 --> 01:09:05.810
Hey. How you doin'?

01:09:08.033 --> 01:09:09.492
What the fuck y'all want?

01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:16.783
Oh, my God.

01:09:17.292 --> 01:09:19.700
Oh, my God!

01:09:19.795 --> 01:09:21.871
You killed him.

01:09:23.299 --> 01:09:26.502
- Have some coke on me.
- Jesus.

01:09:27.553 --> 01:09:29.760
Jesus.

01:09:29.971 --> 01:09:32.642
What did you do? What did you do?

01:09:36.145 --> 01:09:38.600
What the fuck did you do?

01:09:45.654 --> 01:09:48.111
What did I do?

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.447
You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
That's what I did.

01:09:58.168 --> 01:10:02.036
Come up with a more positive
acronym for yourself yet?

01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:04.584
A what?

01:10:07.302 --> 01:10:12.807
You know what I hate more than anything?
I hate the taste of metal in my mouth.

01:10:12.892 --> 01:10:18.728
Silverware makes me gag. I've gotta use
plastic forks and spoons all the time.

01:10:34.706 --> 01:10:36.782
You know, I..

01:10:37.458 --> 01:10:41.456
I never told anybody about
me and the metal taste thing before.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:48.795
Tomorrow.. fuck the cars.

01:10:49.262 --> 01:10:51.588
Just come by the bar.

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.842
I want you to.. We..

01:10:56.103 --> 01:10:59.803
We should have a conversation
about life and shit.

01:11:19.919 --> 01:11:22.291
Yeah, get me Calvin Hart.

01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:31.095
- I didn't do nothin'.
- I'd like to blow your fuckin' head off.

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.896
I didn't do it!

01:13:07.404 --> 01:13:09.730
Bullshit!

01:13:11.492 --> 01:13:14.197
No, I am not gonna talk to you!

01:13:15.454 --> 01:13:18.657
Just keep your fuckin'
mouth shut, all right?

01:13:20.793 --> 01:13:24.043
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
Omar was a federal agent?

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:25.790
He was a what?

01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:29.549
We couldn't compromise
our investigation.

01:13:29.969 --> 01:13:32.756
- He was a what?!
- Your investigation?

01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:36.596
It's called common courtesy.
It's called professionalism!

01:13:36.684 --> 01:13:38.926
You arrogant prick!

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:42.555
- What a fucking waste of time!
- What? Our man was killed..

01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:44.641
and your confidential
informant's a witness!

01:13:44.734 --> 01:13:48.779
Well, maybe your man would still be alive
if you'd bothered to let us in on it.

01:13:48.864 --> 01:13:51.948
- Yeah, it's your own damn fault.
- Our fault?! Let me tell you..

01:13:53.785 --> 01:13:57.119
- Your CI is ours.
- The fuck he is!

01:13:57.831 --> 01:14:01.081
Oh, yeah?
Then I'm chargin' him with homicide.

01:14:01.168 --> 01:14:03.125
Fuck you!

01:14:03.754 --> 01:14:06.589
You're not doin' shit.
I'll go to the US attorney.

01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:10.541
Once they find out that the guy you're
tryin' to indict is a state-run CI..

01:14:10.636 --> 01:14:12.925
that you knew about from day one..

01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:16.098
holy shit, what happens to you?!

01:14:16.183 --> 01:14:18.555
You ever read about yourself
in the paper?

01:14:18.644 --> 01:14:21.515
Your balls shrivel to
the size of chickpeas.

01:14:23.065 --> 01:14:24.725
So whaddaya want?

01:14:25.067 --> 01:14:27.938
- Stop. Talk to me. I'm right here.
- Shut up.

01:14:28.029 --> 01:14:31.279
I want in. I want a joint prosecution,
state and federal..

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:33.157
and I want this in state court.

01:14:33.242 --> 01:14:35.734
- Federal.
- State!

01:14:35.828 --> 01:14:38.913
Federal's what I'll give you,
federal's what you'll get.

01:14:38.998 --> 01:14:40.872
- State court!
- Federal.

01:14:45.797 --> 01:14:48.502
I am right here. Talk to me.

01:14:48.592 --> 01:14:51.427
What the fuck y'all want?

01:14:52.304 --> 01:14:54.380
Oh, my God.

01:14:54.848 --> 01:14:57.256
Oh, my God!

01:14:57.351 --> 01:14:58.845
You killed him.

01:14:58.936 --> 01:15:00.975
- Have some coke on me.
- Jesus.

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:03.221
Jesus.

01:15:03.315 --> 01:15:06.067
What did you do? What did you do?

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.857
What the fuck did you do?

01:15:09.697 --> 01:15:13.481
You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
That's what I did.

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:18.910
- You finished with me now?
- You gotta be dreaming.

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:50.270
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

01:15:52.073 --> 01:15:54.399
State or federal?

01:15:55.202 --> 01:15:57.278
Both.

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:01.866
Come on, scumbag.

01:16:03.168 --> 01:16:05.244
You got nothin'.

01:16:20.019 --> 01:16:24.847
- I wanna go to the beach.
- We have to wait, sweetheart.

01:16:24.941 --> 01:16:28.357
- I forgot Buttercup.
- Shh, honey. We'll get him.

01:16:28.444 --> 01:16:30.271
Can I take her on the beach at least?

01:16:30.363 --> 01:16:34.361
- I'm tellin' ya, there ain't gonna be no trial.
- They're gonna cop a plea.

01:16:34.450 --> 01:16:39.196
- Cop a plea? He killed a fed.
- He didn't know John was a fed. OK?

01:16:39.289 --> 01:16:43.073
- He can't chance a trial.
- I don't like this cereal.

01:16:43.168 --> 01:16:47.830
- We'll do all we can to keep you
off the stand.
- You really think I'm that stupid?

01:16:47.923 --> 01:16:50.877
Fellas, am I tellin' it
the way it is or what?

01:17:09.945 --> 01:17:13.943
- You're a fuckin' maniac, you know that?
- So where they hidin' him?

01:17:14.033 --> 01:17:16.239
Atlantic City?

01:17:17.078 --> 01:17:19.485
How many times you gonna move us?

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.115
We can't stay in one place too long.
It's not smart.

01:17:48.193 --> 01:17:51.776
Can't you even play with her a little,
goddamn you?

01:17:52.906 --> 01:17:54.566
You hangin' on, honey?

01:17:54.658 --> 01:17:57.030
Juicy? Hang on.

01:17:57.119 --> 01:17:59.028
Hang on. Whoo!

01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:02.454
There you go. Hang on.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:05.701
Oooh!

01:18:07.046 --> 01:18:08.872
Hey, sweetie.

01:18:08.964 --> 01:18:12.713
Looky here what I got.
Your wife's final exams.

01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:18.092
- Think we need to monitor her for cheating?
- She cannot take any damn exams, Calvin.

01:18:19.058 --> 01:18:22.474
We're all goin' fuckin' nuts.
I'm losin' my mind.

01:18:22.561 --> 01:18:24.850
Ready, honey? Here we go.

01:18:28.443 --> 01:18:30.519
Look.

01:18:31.738 --> 01:18:34.359
I gotta go into the city tonight.

01:18:34.449 --> 01:18:37.200
My youngest daughter, Coral?

01:18:37.285 --> 01:18:41.864
Maybe tomorrow when I come back
I can bring her with me. You know.

01:18:41.956 --> 01:18:45.207
They're about the same age an' all.
Her and Corinna.

01:18:50.507 --> 01:18:53.212
That would be really good of you, man.

01:19:01.476 --> 01:19:03.054
Hey. Hey!

01:19:03.145 --> 01:19:05.138
Ready? Here we go.

01:19:05.981 --> 01:19:08.223
Whoa, a space ride!

01:19:10.402 --> 01:19:13.522
My guy was in fear of his life,
and he fired in self-defense.

01:19:13.614 --> 01:19:16.650
Dover's gun was holstered
when they pulled him outta the car.

01:19:16.742 --> 01:19:22.448
My guy claims that Agent Dover, Omar,
made a move for it without provocation.

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:26.538
I can produce witnesses to testify that
Agent Dover had drawn a gun on my client..

01:19:26.627 --> 01:19:28.585
at least three times in the past..

01:19:28.671 --> 01:19:34.295
who can testify that they had seen
Agent Dover taking cocaine, repeatedly..

01:19:34.385 --> 01:19:38.430
and that his behavior in the last few
months was bizarre and paranoid.

01:19:38.515 --> 01:19:41.966
Mafia shrinks!
The autopsy came up negative on drugs.

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:45.310
- Did you find anything in the car?
- No.

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.557
No, huh?

01:19:50.777 --> 01:19:54.111
I wanna know if Agent Dover
had assassination clearance.

01:19:54.197 --> 01:19:56.819
- Had what?
- All right, let me rephrase.

01:19:56.908 --> 01:20:01.736
Had clearance to shoot first if he
perceived that his cover had been blown.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.709
- You goin' fishin' here, Jack?
- Not at all.

01:20:05.793 --> 01:20:09.209
I wanna find out if we got a
drug-taking federal agent, strung out..

01:20:09.296 --> 01:20:11.372
with shoot-first clearance.

01:20:11.465 --> 01:20:13.790
In all due respect, if
that's what we got..

01:20:13.884 --> 01:20:16.885
What a bunch of slanderous horseshit!

01:20:26.105 --> 01:20:30.648
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hotel called Tesselers.

01:20:30.735 --> 01:20:32.644
I'm sorry. You got me.

01:20:32.737 --> 01:20:36.687
- It's near Allenville.
- Allenville? You just drove through it.

01:20:36.783 --> 01:20:40.116
- Why don't you backtrack and ask there?
- OK, thank you.

01:20:40.787 --> 01:20:43.076
You're welcome.

01:20:48.670 --> 01:20:50.746
Corinna..

01:20:51.965 --> 01:20:54.041
Corinna!

01:20:57.554 --> 01:20:59.713
Number three to base.
I don't have Corinna.

01:20:59.806 --> 01:21:03.507
I want an inventory of all guns,
drugs & cars acquired in New York.

01:21:03.602 --> 01:21:06.556
I wanna know how they were
disposed of in Philadelphia.

01:21:06.647 --> 01:21:12.353
Was this stuff put back into the community
to establish Dover's street credibility?

01:21:12.444 --> 01:21:15.695
I wanna know how many
other agents were involved.

01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:18.732
Judge, this is an ongoing operation.

01:21:18.826 --> 01:21:20.902
We'd jeopardize agents still in the field.

01:21:20.995 --> 01:21:22.703
How can I prove self-defense..

01:21:22.788 --> 01:21:27.415
if I can't show the pressures on the guy or
find out if the guy had shoot-first clearance?

01:21:27.502 --> 01:21:32.377
OK. Why don't you bring me all the files?
I'll read them in chambers..

01:21:32.465 --> 01:21:37.460
try to sort out what's privileged
and what's appropriate for discovery.

01:21:41.808 --> 01:21:45.758
- I can't do that, Judge.
- What d'you mean? I'm ordering you to.

01:21:54.279 --> 01:21:58.656
Either you produce the files
or I dismiss the indictment.

01:22:04.373 --> 01:22:06.164
Corinna!

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:08.741
- Corinna!
- Corinna!

01:22:09.086 --> 01:22:10.746
Corinna!

01:22:11.547 --> 01:22:13.623
Corinna!

01:22:14.341 --> 01:22:16.417
Corinna!

01:22:17.178 --> 01:22:19.254
Corinna!!

01:22:24.143 --> 01:22:26.219
Co..

01:22:38.157 --> 01:22:40.234
Corinna!

01:22:42.912 --> 01:22:44.407
Corinna!

01:22:44.497 --> 01:22:48.329
I wanna be with my mommy.

01:22:52.589 --> 01:22:55.127
What did..? Honey!

01:22:58.512 --> 01:23:03.340
You guys really weren't putting guns back on
the street just for credibility, were you?

01:23:03.433 --> 01:23:06.933
I mean.. that was just
an educated guess on my part.

01:23:12.192 --> 01:23:16.605
If you try to indict him on anything else,
I'll still wanna know where the goodies went.

01:23:16.822 --> 01:23:20.072
And you can tell the state prosecutor
the same thing!

01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:22.986
You're dropping it?

01:23:24.997 --> 01:23:27.749
I don't believe this shit.

01:23:27.834 --> 01:23:30.407
Well, hell. All right.

01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:34.504
- I guess it's up to me.
- You can't be serious.

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:39.632
Why? Cos you don't wanna
jeopardize national security? Huh?

01:23:39.721 --> 01:23:43.054
Come on! Whose chain
you think you're yankin' here?

01:23:43.975 --> 01:23:47.890
If you guys been doin' shit you shouldn't
have been doin', hey, you know..

01:23:47.979 --> 01:23:51.064
that's your problem.
- We're not givin' up any files.

01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:54.933
Oh, yeah? Well.. we'll see about that.

01:23:59.783 --> 01:24:01.859
Come here.

01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.702
Whaddaya want?

01:24:11.795 --> 01:24:13.871
What do I want?

01:24:14.548 --> 01:24:17.253
I want a judgeship.

01:24:17.343 --> 01:24:19.051
Federal.

01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:32.430
Where they got Kilmartin?
Witness protection?

01:24:32.525 --> 01:24:36.854
- No. I hear he's still on the street.
- No shit?

01:24:36.946 --> 01:24:38.773
Live free or die, huh?

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:45.446
OK. Go to Grandma.

01:24:45.538 --> 01:24:47.614
I gotcha! I gotcha!

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:53.878
I'll talk to you later.

01:24:53.964 --> 01:24:56.669
- Talk to you later too.
- Call Calvin at least.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:00.711
Why? It's gonna be OK.

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:03.180
Bye-bye.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:06.717
Where you goin', Daddy?

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:10.142
- Love you.
- OK.

01:26:31.355 --> 01:26:35.899
It's me, Calvin. Come on, gimme the gun.
Turn it loose! Gimme the gun.

01:26:42.409 --> 01:26:45.326
Politics? What does that mean?

01:26:45.996 --> 01:26:48.700
- What does that mean?
- Jimmy, look..

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:51.827
Why.. why are you here?

01:26:51.918 --> 01:26:54.623
Why are you here?
What'd you come to my house for?

01:26:54.713 --> 01:26:57.120
To tell me I got the shaft?

01:26:58.258 --> 01:27:00.547
To take my gun away from me?

01:27:02.721 --> 01:27:04.381
Hmm. Yeah.

01:27:04.473 --> 01:27:08.518
People come to me, say
"Jimmy, we need your help.
Please help us." And I do.

01:27:08.602 --> 01:27:11.389
But whatever I do,
I end up gettin' fucked.

01:27:12.439 --> 01:27:15.974
My family.. hangin' by a thread.

01:27:20.156 --> 01:27:23.322
What's not gonna happen..
that I'm goin' down.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.536
Gimme somethin', Calvin.

01:27:31.876 --> 01:27:34.118
Calvin, gimme somethin', please.

01:27:36.005 --> 01:27:38.081
Please.

01:27:38.466 --> 01:27:40.210
Help me.

01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:48.050
- You wanna get a dog?
- Yeah.

01:27:56.693 --> 01:28:00.442
- Gimme two hot dogs. Mustard? Relish?
- Mustard.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:07.865
I thought you said you were a man of honor.

01:28:14.044 --> 01:28:16.582
Shouldn't you be in witness protection?

01:28:16.672 --> 01:28:21.334
What's Junior Brown doin' out on the street?
He killed a federal agent.

01:28:21.427 --> 01:28:23.503
Shit happens.

01:28:24.138 --> 01:28:26.131
I don't understand.

01:28:26.224 --> 01:28:28.679
You had the murder tape, you had me.

01:28:32.605 --> 01:28:34.681
Come here.

01:28:43.283 --> 01:28:45.026
What tape?

01:28:45.118 --> 01:28:47.194
And who the fuck are you?

01:28:48.455 --> 01:28:50.364
You know the worst part about this job?

01:28:50.457 --> 01:28:54.407
Dealing with one lowlife CI after another.
It's enough to make you sick.

01:28:54.503 --> 01:28:59.212
Well, I guess you won't have to bother
with that any more, huh, Judge?

01:29:01.134 --> 01:29:03.672
Where'd you hear that?

01:29:03.762 --> 01:29:09.717
Let Junior Brown walk, win
yourself a federal judgeship.
At least you don't come cheap.

01:29:14.607 --> 01:29:16.683
You know..

01:29:17.777 --> 01:29:21.691
the Junior Browns of the world
will always be with us.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.733
What's one Junior Brown more or less..

01:29:24.825 --> 01:29:28.325
compared to the work that I can do
as a federal judge?

01:29:29.539 --> 01:29:33.868
I'm a good goddamn prosecutor,
but I will make a great judge.

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:36.994
Let's see what happens
when I go to the papers.

01:29:37.088 --> 01:29:42.379
With what? "Fuck with the bull, you
get the horns"? What is he, a matador?

01:29:42.927 --> 01:29:47.340
Besides, the last I heard that tape
got ate by the garbage monster.

01:30:03.991 --> 01:30:06.067
Jimmy?

01:30:09.204 --> 01:30:11.909
You got a phone call.

01:30:13.667 --> 01:30:16.787
- Hello?
- How soon can you get to Baby Cakes?

01:30:16.879 --> 01:30:18.670
- What you doin' there?
- How long?

01:30:18.756 --> 01:30:20.583
I don't know.. 20 minutes.

01:30:20.674 --> 01:30:23.960
- 20 minutes. Don't be late.
- Jimmy..

01:30:25.846 --> 01:30:27.720
Shit!

01:30:43.865 --> 01:30:45.324
Hey!

01:30:49.871 --> 01:30:51.947
Hey! Junior.

01:30:55.836 --> 01:30:57.378
What's shakin'?

01:30:57.462 --> 01:31:01.709
- What are you doin' here?
- I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.876
You killed a fed.

01:31:04.761 --> 01:31:07.965
- How the hell did you walk on that?
- Shit happens.

01:31:08.057 --> 01:31:11.141
You blew his brains all over me,
his people know that..

01:31:11.226 --> 01:31:14.809
How did they even let you live?
"Shit happens."

01:31:14.897 --> 01:31:16.475
"Shit happens." I guess so.

01:31:16.565 --> 01:31:20.349
Did you tell the cops how metal
in my mouth makes me gag?

01:31:22.238 --> 01:31:24.314
Cos it was a funny thing.

01:31:25.283 --> 01:31:27.690
I couldn't get plastic forks in jail.

01:31:29.620 --> 01:31:32.290
I had to eat everything with my fingers.

01:31:34.834 --> 01:31:36.910
What the hell..?

01:31:43.802 --> 01:31:46.375
How did you swing it, Junior?

01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:48.345
I'm dyin' to know.

01:31:48.431 --> 01:31:53.224
Now is not the time, my man,
but I'm gonna see you real soon.

01:31:54.729 --> 01:31:56.272
Let's go.

01:31:56.356 --> 01:31:58.349
Get back. Easy. Easy..

01:32:05.157 --> 01:32:07.233
Get over there.

01:32:12.373 --> 01:32:14.531
See me now.

01:32:14.625 --> 01:32:18.837
Jimmy, answer me this.
Who do I visit first?

01:32:19.463 --> 01:32:23.757
You at your house, or your
wife & kid up at Grandma's?

01:32:28.055 --> 01:32:31.389
You don't like the taste of metal
in your mouth, huh?

01:32:32.435 --> 01:32:34.428
Open up.

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:36.809
Come on, Junior.

01:32:36.898 --> 01:32:38.974
Say "ah".

01:32:41.402 --> 01:32:43.858
You saw what I did to Omar?

01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:47.566
Guess who's next.

01:32:48.243 --> 01:32:49.903
No!

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.536
Don't touch him!

01:33:08.806 --> 01:33:11.344
You know this don't end with you, right?

01:33:14.687 --> 01:33:20.440
I'm gonna.. I'm gonna take your baby girl
for another walk in the woods.

01:33:21.736 --> 01:33:23.146
No!

01:34:29.722 --> 01:34:31.798
Hold on. Whoa!

01:34:32.350 --> 01:34:34.426
Now you did it.

01:34:38.565 --> 01:34:43.772
Don't you know you can't go around
hittin' the police. Huh?

01:34:43.862 --> 01:34:46.234
What's wrong with you?!

01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:51.693
Come on. Get up. Get up!

01:34:53.163 --> 01:34:54.871
Don't move. Huh?

01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:03.085
- What do we got?
- Assaulting an officer.

01:35:03.173 --> 01:35:05.249
Nobody can touch me!

01:35:05.884 --> 01:35:07.960
Nobody.

01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:13.216
Jesus, I'm sorry.

01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:22.858
You got anything you wanna explain to me,
you suicidal son of a bitch?

01:35:25.696 --> 01:35:28.069
- Fuck.
- I ain't suicidal.

01:35:28.157 --> 01:35:32.570
With this tape, you can drop Junior
down the hole for 30 years.

01:35:33.329 --> 01:35:36.698
You still gotta get Zioli to prosecute.

01:35:39.544 --> 01:35:41.786
You saw what I did to Omar?

01:35:43.631 --> 01:35:45.707
Guess who's next.

01:35:46.634 --> 01:35:48.212
So what?

01:35:48.303 --> 01:35:50.876
What'd he do to Omar? He didn't specify.

01:35:50.972 --> 01:35:52.929
You don't like that tape?

01:35:53.016 --> 01:35:55.092
Well..

01:36:00.482 --> 01:36:04.350
How about this one?
They would love it on TV.

01:36:04.444 --> 01:36:06.484
What's one Junior Brown more or less..

01:36:06.572 --> 01:36:10.569
compared to the work
that I can do as a federal judge?

01:36:10.659 --> 01:36:15.784
I'm a good goddamn prosecutor,
but I will make a great judge.

01:36:18.209 --> 01:36:20.581
You like that one better?

01:36:23.965 --> 01:36:27.630
I re-indict Junior, you gotta take
the stand, start all over again.

01:36:27.718 --> 01:36:29.925
Nah. I think I'm gonna get lost.

01:36:30.012 --> 01:36:34.591
My family's health is in your best
interest, so you better do a good job.

01:36:35.268 --> 01:36:39.597
Listen to the part where he says
"You saw what I did to Omar."

01:36:40.231 --> 01:36:42.307
Listen to that again.

01:36:44.277 --> 01:36:48.061
- It's probably better than you think.
- Kilmartin, wait. Jimmy!

01:36:48.239 --> 01:36:50.279
Don't do this to me!

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:00.825
Daddy, come on, let's go!

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:24.300
