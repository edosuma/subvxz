WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.533
Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:02.669 --> 00:05.001
I found it. I found the Night Room.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.542
- Open that door for us.
- I don't know how to open it.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.834
I believe you.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.875
- They're going to kill us.
- It doesn't matter.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.674
The plague is right down there.

00:14.806 --> 00:17.764
This is why I'm here.
This is what I came here for.

00:17.893 --> 00:19.804
I believe something happened to you,

00:19.937 --> 00:22.679
but I do not believe
it was a time traveler.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.066
This Cole,
did he find you or did you find him?

00:25.192 --> 00:26.898
Him? You mean God?

00:27.027 --> 00:30.394
- No, the Witness.
- Who is that, your boss?

00:30.531 --> 00:33.147
- Am I dying now?
- No, not today.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.111
Why am I still here? Something's wrong.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.575
Cassie. Come on.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.650
COLE: Cassie!

01:09.778 --> 01:11.063
Cole!

01:16.535 --> 01:18.651
(GROANS)

01:30.924 --> 01:32.505
(DRIP)

01:32.634 --> 01:34.010
(DRIP)

01:34.136 --> 01:36.218
(THUD)

01:45.188 --> 01:46.928
Cassie!

02:19.181 --> 02:21.263
What the hell's going on?

02:23.018 --> 02:25.100
Jones?

02:27.022 --> 02:29.104
Ramse?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.618
West 7.

02:43.747 --> 02:44.907
MAN: Hey.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.797
What are you doing?

02:58.053 --> 02:59.918
Who's this asshole?

03:00.055 --> 03:02.341
COLE: Jones.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.882
- He's one of us.
- Where's Jones, the scientist?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.976
- Whitley's repair hag?
- Whitley. Where's Whitley?

03:08.105 --> 03:11.188
Well, the crazy bitch
could use some company.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.650
- Get up.
- Get up.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.233
MAN: Hey.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.701
You got a visitor.
This one says he needs ya.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.572
Oh, and keep your hands off each other.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.619
(LAUGHTER)

03:31.461 --> 03:33.122
Jones?

03:33.255 --> 03:34.540
Do we know each other?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.882
It's me. It's Cole.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.760
Did you take a hit
when the West 7 came back?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.594
Came back?

03:43.724 --> 03:47.433
- We fought 'em off.
- Yeah, we fought and were defeated.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.638
That was two years ago.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.853
Where do you come from?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.853
From your machine over there.

03:55.986 --> 04:00.480
I remember all the faces
of the men that went in there.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.650
Yours is not one of them,
and they never came back.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.870
What is that?
Did you do that to yourself?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.169
If you can't be right,
at least be brave.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.795
You were right.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.086
You sent me back before the plague.
l was there.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.336
Look. Look at these marks, these marks.

04:24.514 --> 04:28.678
It's from your injections
to make me part of the system.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.426
Remember? Time moves around me.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.486
- What is it?
- I'm having memories, seeing things.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.149
This is wrong. You're wrong.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.784
If this were true,
there's one way to find out.

05:12.479 --> 05:17.849
Your molecules are in a constant state
of flux... shifting at a quantum level.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.145
Only my injections could have done this.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.573
This is my life's work.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.858
Yes.

05:29.412 --> 05:34.031
l was in 2015,
but when l splintered back...

05:34.167 --> 05:37.910
- Splintered?
- Yeah, splintered.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.125
I ended up... here.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.420
This isn't my time.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.966
- Something must have changed history.
- Changed how?

05:48.098 --> 05:52.842
Altered it somehow. Instead of returning
to your present, you came here.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.014
What did you do in 2015?

05:55.188 --> 05:59.056
You sent me back
to destroy the virus, stop the plague.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.729
To Chechnya, yes? Of 2015.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.229
The first outbreak was at the hand
of an intelligence agency.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.357
- They called it Operation Troy.
- Troy? No.

06:08.493 --> 06:14.739
No, in my time...
the virus didn't start until 2016.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.455
We tracked it to a group
called the Army of the 12 Monkeys.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.374
Dr. Railly and l, we, uh...

06:21.506 --> 06:22.712
Who?

06:24.843 --> 06:26.549
Cassie. Dr. Railly.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.756
The message.
The transmission. Leland Frost.

06:34.603 --> 06:39.393
- Dr. Cassandra Railly from the CDC.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Cole.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.606
I've never heard of her.

06:46.865 --> 06:51.859
Leland Goines told me I saw him in 1987,
but I've never been there.

06:51.995 --> 06:55.158
It's called a jinn. A causality loop.

06:55.290 --> 07:00.910
But this is different. Something
very significant altered your timeline.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.788
COLE: Cassie started our investigation
in my time.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.336
She sent us a message from the CDC.

07:06.468 --> 07:11.758
Your Dr. Railly was murdered,
shot in 2015.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.150
They must have killed her
after I splintered.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.073
Looks like her death
was the point of divergence.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.199
Somehow her absence
must have caused the plague

07:36.331 --> 07:38.788
to be released
a year earlier in Chechnya.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.787
She must have been very important.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.293
She was.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.301
She is.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.012
I'm having difficulty
remembering things right now.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.890
You're having memories
from two different realities.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.556
The human brain
is not made for such things.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.805
If you can't correct the past...

08:04.317 --> 08:07.059
...this condition
is certainly gonna kill you.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.028
- Does the machine still work?
- It brought you back here.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.896
Send me back.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.656
I am no longer
in command of this facility.

08:17.831 --> 08:22.074
If you wanna use the machine, you have
to speak with the head of the West 7.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.126
Mr. Whitley,
I need to talk to your boss.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.875
He's not gonna take kindly
to being disturbed,

08:34.097 --> 08:38.261
Yeah, I know this guy.
I guess he's an asshole in any reality.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.180
- Somebody to see you. Says his name...
- It's all right.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.303
We know each other, don't we, Deacon?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.608
Ramse. What happened to you?

08:48.737 --> 08:50.944
What is this?

08:51.072 --> 08:54.656
- Who the hell is this?
- Hey, it's me. It's Cole.

08:56.327 --> 09:00.240
I buried Cole.
I covered the grave myself.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.705
Wait a minute.
ljust came out of that machine.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.203
- Nothing comes from there.
- OK, all right.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.203
You and I, we left the West 7.
Jones and her crew took us in.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.795
- (YELLS)
- Whoa! Hey!

09:09.966 --> 09:12.548
Only girl you've ever loved is Elena.

09:12.677 --> 09:15.965
Your mother's name is Roberta.
You told me once she's pretty.

09:16.097 --> 09:20.340
When I make jokes about banging her, you
laugh, but secretly it pisses you off.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.142
Cole?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.484
It's good to see you too.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.785
- You buried me?
- I watched you die.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.782
We stumbled upon this place together.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.665
- Soldiers beat the hell out of us.
- Yeah, that happened.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.297
You took a hit and you never woke up.

09:53.426 --> 09:59.092
That didn't happen. Jones bailed me out.
She knew my name from Cassie's message.

09:59.265 --> 10:04.180
I got free, went back to the 7 camp,
found Deacon.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.020
He didn't go down without a fight.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.316
Rallied the others,
took this place back over.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.527
It's been good to us.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.690
I need to use the machine.

10:18.827 --> 10:22.695
If I fire this thing up,
it's gonna drain us.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.538
We're not gonna have any power left.

10:25.667 --> 10:31.958
I can undo all this, put things back
the way they're supposed to be.

10:32.090 --> 10:36.834
These people... they depend on me.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.169
I gotta look out for their future.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.388
There is no future.

10:43.017 --> 10:46.805
"Whatever the world is now,
it doesn't have to be this."

10:46.980 --> 10:48.811
Remember?

10:48.982 --> 10:52.770
- I can change it.
- You're not actually considering this?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.190
If you turn this thing on,
we'll bleed the core out, we'll be done.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.404
We can't survive.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.487
Maybe we're not supposed to.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.158
Do it.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.532
- Start it up.
- No! Stop this right now.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.705
- Stand down.
- Marcus, put the gun away.

11:11.838 --> 11:15.672
I gave up everything for you
and this thing.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.667
- It didn't work.
- It did work.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.421
We have a chance to survive here, now.

11:22.557 --> 11:26.891
There is no chance. You left Spearhead.
You left your father.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.143
You followed me for a reason.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.267
Jones. Jones!

11:35.403 --> 11:36.609
No!

11:36.738 --> 11:38.524
(GROANS)

11:42.702 --> 11:45.910
Cole, you have to leave now.
When? Where?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.655
- July 6th, 2015, Baltimore.
- You'll need help.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.952
Find somebody you can trust.

11:51.127 --> 11:56.417
Once you correct the timeline,
the machine will bring you back home.

11:56.549 --> 12:00.508
I'm gonna fix this, I promise you.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.468
Sacrifice, that's the only way.

12:03.431 --> 12:08.971
The other me, the one who sent you,
she knows this.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.978
Ask her about it, Mr. Cole.

12:12.106 --> 12:15.598
Go. Mr. Cole, you have to go.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.775
You're a good man in any reality.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.820
Hey. See you on the flip side.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.372
What the hell are you doing?

13:16.504 --> 13:17.835
What day is it?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.628
Thanks.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.516
Let's look at this just released video
from cyber whistle blower Adam Wexler.

13:31.644 --> 13:35.728
America keeps her secrets
in a glass case with a sign that says,

13:35.857 --> 13:37.893
"Do not break. "

13:38.026 --> 13:41.518
But I have a hammer
and I will set you free.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.236
Rumors that Wexler is hiding
in a compound in Ch...

13:50.580 --> 13:53.947
Senator, Langley just sent
a new briefing to your secure server.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.493
I bet they did.

13:57.253 --> 14:01.667
Does this have to do with Wexler?
I know, you'd fill me in, but...

14:01.799 --> 14:05.542
Then you'd have to be destroyed.
Pleasure of the Intelligence Committee.

14:05.678 --> 14:10.012
We have to talk appropriations. The
subcommittee wants to have a meeting...

14:10.183 --> 14:14.517
Did you ask the FBI
to look into the death of Leland Goines?

14:15.521 --> 14:18.558
I asked a friend for a favor,
that's all.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.851
Is this about your ex?

14:19.984 --> 14:23.067
Goines was a very big campaign donor.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.104
I would like a heads up
if anything is coming our way.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.523
- And is there?
- No.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.946
It's handled.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.743
- Don't worry.
- Good.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.709
I have a lunch. Appropriations after?

14:39.837 --> 14:41.919
Of course.

14:52.683 --> 14:53.889
Just keep walking.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.602
- OK. Look, I don't have any cash.
- I don't want that. I need your help.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.813
- You. What the hell are you doing?
- Come on, walk.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.812
Open the door. Open it.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.027
Get in. Get in!

15:09.951 --> 15:11.532
- Drive.
- Where?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.526
Cassie's place, with all the books.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.450
There's no way in hell
that I am taking you to her.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.540
- She's in danger.
- Yeah, yeah, from you.

15:19.669 --> 15:23.036
- Where is she? What'd you do to her?
- Cassie told you about the future.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.379
The plague?

15:25.550 --> 15:30.135
I'm having trouble remembering things,
but Cassie's a memory that sticks.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.511
- Drive the car.
- OK.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.723
You ruined our lives,
you son of a bitch.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.140
- (CAR ALARM BLARES)
- (AARON GROANS)

15:43.568 --> 15:47.356
Nice job, jackass.
You got that out of your system now?

15:47.530 --> 15:50.067
- Yeah.
- Good. Drive us out of here.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.299
Here, clean yourself up.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.925
Look, I don't have a lot of time
to explain this to you.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.598
They're gonna put a bullet
in Cassie's head.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.564
- Who's they?
- The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.683
They're the ones that start the plague.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.231
Just tell me where she is.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.897
Right now she's in a place called
the Night Room, a Markridge facility.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.241
They're trying
to get into the vault now.

16:35.453 --> 16:39.787
- Her and I are tied up in a room...
- You crazy piece of shit.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.828
- You are sitting right here.
- The other me.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.747
Not this me, the other me.
That's why I need you, OK?

16:45.880 --> 16:49.043
I can't cross with myself.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.633
Believe me, you don't wanna be around
for a paradox, OK?

16:52.762 --> 16:55.549
Look, you help me, you help her.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.639
- If you hurt her...
- I'm trying to protect her.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.599
Then call the cops.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.936
If these guys see us coming, she's dead.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.191
Got it?

17:07.026 --> 17:11.019
We need to get her before
they take her out of the Night Room.

17:11.697 --> 17:15.531
You and me? No, this is crazy.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.367
Look, there's something
that Cassie does.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.953
It changes everything in my time.

17:21.082 --> 17:24.199
Right now
she's the only thing that matters.

17:24.418 --> 17:28.411
I've been traveling back and forth
between 2043 and now.

17:28.589 --> 17:32.002
Every time the future's the same.
This time it changed.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.092
Something's different with the plague,
I don't know what.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.928
- Chechnya, Operation Troy.
- What?

17:38.057 --> 17:41.675
- Cassie plays a role somehow.
- Operation Troy?

17:41.811 --> 17:45.474
How do you know about that?
That's classified.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.312
Where I come from, it's history.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.859
Look, you're never gonna believe me.
I get that.

17:51.988 --> 17:55.480
Cassie does.
That should mean something to you.

17:56.826 --> 18:00.910
You don't help me, she dies,
simple as that,

18:01.038 --> 18:04.451
and there's nothing the cops
or anybody else can do to stop it.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.826
(SIRENS WAIL)

18:07.962 --> 18:10.749
(CAR DOORS SLAM)

18:10.881 --> 18:14.009
Shit. Shit.

18:14.135 --> 18:18.253
They're coming here.
I, um... I called 911.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.046
- What's 911?
- (BANGING)

18:21.225 --> 18:22.931
That's 911.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.052
- Back door?
- Back door. Go.

18:26.814 --> 18:28.930
OFFICER: Everybody all right?

18:45.541 --> 18:48.578
OK, that's the Night Room.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.167
Here.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.754
- You know how to use that?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

18:53.883 --> 18:58.627
Um... Just show me
where the safety is on this thing.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.971
It's a revolver. There is no safety.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.964
- Right.
- Have you fired a gun before?

19:04.101 --> 19:06.843
- Yes, yes, I got it.
- Just point it and pull the trigger.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.220
- I got it.
- All right, here's the plan.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.849
Any minute they're gonna come out
and make their way towards the van.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.727
You and me are gonna stay low,
use the cars for cover.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.275
There's gonna be three of 'em.

19:18.407 --> 19:22.320
The tall, pale man, that's the leader.
You take a shot at him, distract him.

19:22.495 --> 19:26.864
- I get in there and get Cassie.
- OK. Then... Then what do I do?

19:26.999 --> 19:31.117
You haul ass and try not to get shot.
Sound good? All right.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.635
Do it. Take the shot.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.676
What are you waiting for? Do it.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.891
I don't have a clear shot.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.305
- Cole!
- Stay back.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.974
Cassie!

-Shﬂ.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.536
Jesus Christ!

20:16.924 --> 20:18.755
- You OK?
- Yeah. Stick to the plan.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.216
- That did not work.
- You shot me.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.470
- What? That's impossible.
- Not me me, the other me.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.938
What? What are you talking about?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.227
Never mind.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.271
Markridge. Nice timing, assholes.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.986
All right, Jennifer's OK.
Come on, let's go.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.611
If they wanted to kill Cassie,
they'd have done it then and there.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.701
- She's still alive.
- Shit. Shit!

20:51.834 --> 20:54.371
- I should have got the license plate.
- What's that?

20:54.503 --> 20:57.370
It's the number on the back of the car.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.997
7XY D42.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.500
- Wait a minute. You sure?
- Yeah. Why?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.888
What are you doing?

21:08.017 --> 21:10.053
I'm calling in a favor.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.073
WOMAN: You didn't get it.
Virus wasn't in the Night Room.

21:26.202 --> 21:29.945
TALL MAN: It wasn't there,
just a corpse, nothing cultivated.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.286
Markridge is a dead end.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.906
WOMAN:
The brotherhood will turn up something.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.999
Next we need to prepare Dr. Railly.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.461
TALL MAN: Why pursue this?
We should get rid of her now.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.840
WOMAN: No. I told you,
the Witness has spoken.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.092
She's too important.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.888
That van's been off the grid since 2011.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.064
Before then, it was licensed
for refrigeration at a dozen companies.

22:02.196 --> 22:05.734
It's been used as a mortuary van,
landscaping, transport,

22:05.866 --> 22:07.572
even a goddamn ice-cream truck.

22:07.743 --> 22:11.235
Wait. Landscaping?
That's like flowers, right?

22:11.372 --> 22:12.202
Yeah.

22:12.331 --> 22:16.495
That tall guy you took a shot at,
he's really into that shit.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.847
- There's nobody here.
- What are we looking for?

22:35.980 --> 22:39.518
Tracks. All animals leave 'em.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.575
- Let's go.
- No.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.508
What is this?

23:14.810 --> 23:16.846
- Here, drink.
- No.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.061
Please, Dr. Railly.

23:23.277 --> 23:25.188
No. No.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.031
Good. Thank you.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.750
It's an honor to meet you, Dr. Railly.

23:48.344 --> 23:51.802
I want you to listen to my voice,
Cassandra. It's important.

23:53.098 --> 23:57.888
You're walking through a red forest
and the grass is tall.

24:00.981 --> 24:06.021
You're walking through a red forest
and the grass is tall.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.190
The grass is tall.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.323
You're walking through a red forest.
The grass is tall.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.162
Why are you doing this?

24:27.132 --> 24:29.293
Because you're important.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.291
He has plans for you.

24:32.346 --> 24:35.634
- The Witness.
- He wants to meet you.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.941
I've seen this before.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.410
- AARON: What is that?
- No idea.

25:02.543 --> 25:06.206
We don't know much about 'em,
why they're doing this.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.249
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.381
(GROANS)

25:20.102 --> 25:23.515
- Give me the gun.
- What? I left it in the car.

Stop! We need him alive!

and the grass is tall.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.011
It's just rained.
Most of the blood has washed away.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.054
Most of the blood has washed away.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.303
There's a house in the distance.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.347
Cedar and pine.

26:08.484 --> 26:11.100
You've been there before.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.114
See him. Go to him.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.466
Where's your boss?

26:39.598 --> 26:41.759
Hm?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.674
Where's your boss, asshole?

26:46.522 --> 26:49.935
The one with the scar.
I gave him that scar.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.686
I can give you one too.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.445
Where is she?

26:58.408 --> 27:00.194
Where is she?

27:03.455 --> 27:04.695
Where is she?

27:05.415 --> 27:06.621
Where is she?

27:07.459 --> 27:08.619
Where is she?!

27:09.878 --> 27:12.164
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Look, hey.

27:12.297 --> 27:17.508
How is he gonna tell us anything
if he's not breathing, huh?

27:17.678 --> 27:21.045
- I know what I'm doing.
- Just let me give it a try.

27:31.608 --> 27:35.271
Hey. Come here. Come here.

27:38.115 --> 27:44.202
Look, listen to me. I don't know
this guy. I don't trust this guy.

27:44.329 --> 27:48.823
But if you don't know where she is,
you're of no use to him.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.543
And then
he's just gonna do this for fun.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.372
Are you listening?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.672
OK.

28:00.804 --> 28:06.049
They told me
they'd kill my family if I talk.

28:08.478 --> 28:12.266
I don't know them, all right?

28:12.399 --> 28:16.312
They just hired me to get in that lab.
We dropped off the blonde.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.403
They brought me back here
to patch me up. That's it.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.322
So where is she?

28:32.044 --> 28:34.126
You did a good job back there.

28:35.172 --> 28:37.163
I let you kill a man.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.755
You didn't let me do anything.

28:38.884 --> 28:42.797
- I didn't stop you.
- You still don't believe me, do you?

28:42.930 --> 28:46.798
I believe that this cult is real,

28:46.934 --> 28:50.518
but, no, I don't think
you're Marty McFly.

28:50.646 --> 28:51.635
Who?

28:57.569 --> 29:00.777
- Do you think she's already...
- No, I don't.

29:01.907 --> 29:05.240
I've spent my entire career
putting bullshit soundbites

29:05.369 --> 29:06.984
into other people's heads.

29:07.162 --> 29:11.121
Cassie's the only person
who ever filled me with anything.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.786
I can't lose her again.

29:14.002 --> 29:19.622
Got a buddy back in 2043
always says this thing.

29:21.218 --> 29:26.929
Everybody's got two wolves inside 'em.
Both of them are starving.

29:27.140 --> 29:32.260
One wolf is anger, envy, pride.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.557
The other one's truth, kindness.

29:36.024 --> 29:39.016
Every day they tear each other apart,

29:39.194 --> 29:42.732
but it's not the better wolf that wins.

29:42.864 --> 29:44.650
It's the one you feed.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.784
Cassie feeds the good one.

Know him like a memory of tomorrow.

30:24.072 --> 30:26.905
We go in, we get Cassie and we get out.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.741
That's it? How about a plan this time?

30:29.870 --> 30:32.327
Everybody wants a plan. There's no time.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.321
You're a time traveler.

30:34.458 --> 30:38.542
Look, you just keep an eye out, OK?
I'll take care of the guard.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.661
Right. I'll cover you.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.246
Don't do that.

30:50.682 --> 30:54.345
It's getting worse, isn't it?
Look, if you can't do this...

30:54.478 --> 30:57.345
What? Are you gonna go in on your own?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.614
Come on. Let's go.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.289
Why are you doing this?

31:26.385 --> 31:28.546

Wait. He's here, the Witness.
You have to go back.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.366
You have to kill him.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.365
We gotta get you out.
You're not safe yet.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.160
- No. What?
- You're still in danger.

- No. Forget about me.
- Cassie, listen to him.

- Cole.
- Listen to me.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.667
I've seen the future without you.
I can't let that happen.

34:47.711 --> 34:50.794
There was a man there...

34:50.922 --> 34:56.462
in a kind of plague doctor mask.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.716
They call him the Witness.

35:05.979 --> 35:08.561
They gave me something,

35:08.690 --> 35:11.773
um, a drug, lthink.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.319
It made me see things.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.741
Do you wanna talk about it?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.705
No.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.917
I'm sorry, Cass.

35:31.046 --> 35:35.335
- It's OK. It's over now.
- No, I wasn't there for you.

35:37.344 --> 35:42.930
The past two years
you were alone with all of this.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.219
And you were right.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.236
So what happens now?

and we have to stop them.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.297
...but I think
it's what we're looking for.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.946
Who took it? Who took my eye?

36:48.123 --> 36:50.205
You're a funny guy.

36:50.333 --> 36:54.042
What took you so long? I was starting
to think you were gonna stay back there.

36:54.170 --> 36:58.004
No, no, I missed your loving arms.
I had to get back.

36:58.133 --> 37:02.251
Jones filled me in, said something
about alternate reality, whatever.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.969
- What happened?
- There's not much to tell.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.389
I got her killed.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.269
- You fixed it.
- Yeah.

- He was a pain in the ass?

37:25.368 --> 37:27.609
- Very similar to you.
- Good to have you back.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.698
- Thanks, brother.
- You look like shit.

37:29.873 --> 37:32.285
Take a look in the mirror.

37:32.417 --> 37:35.750
Those remains in the Night Room,
they were human?

37:35.879 --> 37:40.122
Yeah. Jennifer said
it was the origin of the virus.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.383
- We destroyed it. It's gone.
- Yet the virus is still out there.

37:43.511 --> 37:47.299
This Operation Troy, the one that I...
she told you about...

37:47.432 --> 37:52.301
The other you said it's how the virus
starts in 2015, somewhere in Chechnya.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.974
But not anymore,
because you saved Dr. Railly

37:55.106 --> 37:57.893
and the plague is,
as it always was, in 2016.

37:58.067 --> 38:02.652
But whatever this Operation Troy is,
it involves the very same virus.

38:02.781 --> 38:07.070
And perhaps, if the 12 Monkeys
didn't find it in the Night Room,

38:07.202 --> 38:08.237
they found it there.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.244
What about the Witness?
Cassie said she saw him.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.828
- But did you?
- No.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.869
You could send me to the same warehouse
a few weeks earlier.

38:16.002 --> 38:19.085
That is assuming that
we fully understand this conspiracy.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.375
We almost lost our entire investigation

38:21.508 --> 38:24.215
in an alternate timeline
where Dr. Railly died.

38:24.344 --> 38:27.256
We cannot risk going back
to the same moment again.

38:27.388 --> 38:32.803
For the time being,
our focus has to be Operation Troy.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.764
Dismissed.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.571
The double memories, they've subsided?

38:50.745 --> 38:54.363
Yeah.
But I can still feel them in my mind.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.659
It hurts.

38:55.792 --> 38:59.501
Your synaptic activity appears normal.
You should be fine.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.163
Well, I'm not... am I?

39:05.176 --> 39:10.466
You know, the other you told me
to ask you about the cost of all this,

39:10.598 --> 39:13.055
sacﬁﬁce.

39:13.184 --> 39:17.553
Every time I splinter, it feels like
I'm being ripped apart from the inside.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.605
Eventually I'm not coming back, am I?

39:23.486 --> 39:26.569
If you succeed, it doesn't matter.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.354
No.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.447
But if I don't?

39:30.577 --> 39:32.863
James...

39:32.996 --> 39:37.205
you and I, we're breaking
the unwritten rules of the universe.

39:39.252 --> 39:45.122
But time...
it's going to take what it's owed.

39:48.887 --> 39:52.721
Eventually it will kill you.

39:53.516 --> 39:56.132
How many jumps have I got left?

39:56.728 --> 39:59.140
Not as many as I'd like.

39:59.272 --> 40:00.853
Is it enough?

40:04.027 --> 40:06.109
It has to be.
