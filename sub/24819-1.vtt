00:15.640 --> 00:16.808
[belt buckle rattles]

00:16.891 --> 00:19.394
-[Sam] No, wait. Okay.
-[Ethan] Alright, I got it.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.063
-[grunts] Yeah, okay.
-You know what?

00:22.147 --> 00:22.981
[Ethan groans]

00:23.064 --> 00:25.150
-Put me back down.
-Huh? What?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.651
-Put me down.
-Why?

00:26.735 --> 00:30.447
I don't like it when you're grimacing.
Can you see how that's insulting?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.741
No, I'm grimacing from pleasure.
That's a pleasure grimace.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.035
You don't make that face
when we're in bed. Put me down.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.370
-I'm trying to get some purchase.
-Put me down.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.914
-Okay. I promise, I'm sorry.
-Okay.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.751
-[moans] Alright.
-Okay, there we go.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.753
That's harder, that's a bad angle.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.796
-Oh, no! Oh! Jesus.
-Oh, God.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.007
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry. What happened?
-Oh, my God.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.843
It's okay. You kneed me in the vagina,
just a little bit. It's okay.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.845
-I kneed you? I'm sorry.
-Just a little bit.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.722
-Go get a condom.
-Okay.

01:01.978 --> 01:05.231
-Shit.
-Dude! Get in here!

01:07.609 --> 01:10.653
-Alrighty. Guess what?
-Yeah, come here.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.782
I am out, so we can skip just this once.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.617
No, we can't.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.828
You have been trying that line on me
for two decades,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.497
literally since freshman year.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.083
-Yeah, because it works.
-Um, no, it's never worked once.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.796
[stammers]
Okay, what are the chances that you, um...

01:29.714 --> 01:32.008
Let me put it...
You're not menopaused are you?

01:32.467 --> 01:35.720
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:35.804 --> 01:38.640
People menopause at different times.
You could easily be menopaused.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.893
Can you stop saying "menopaused"?
I'm not a DVD player.

01:41.976 --> 01:45.063
-It should be menostopped, not menopaused.
-It's not either, it's not a verb.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.358
It's just that we find ourselves
in a very tricky situation here.

01:48.441 --> 01:52.195
If only... three to five dollars
could solve it.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.664
-[Dash] My turn!
-[boy] I don't care.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.083
My turn! Give it to me... now!

02:05.166 --> 02:07.460
-My turn!
-No, it's not.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.796
I said it's my turn, you cunt!

02:10.839 --> 02:12.215
Holy shit.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.300
-[boy] Mine!
-Dash, this language is...

02:14.926 --> 02:16.636
[cell phone rings]

02:20.557 --> 02:22.851
Okay, here we are, ta-da, penis covers.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.645
I have to fly home to New York,
I'm going standby.

02:25.728 --> 02:29.399
-No. What happened?
-It's not a big deal, but I have to go.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.610
We've got some shit to talk about. There's
something I really need to tell you.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.780
Are you in love with me? Are you leaving
your wife? Should I leave Jon?

02:36.406 --> 02:39.450
I'm sorry,
I'm just really stressed about Dash.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.661
-Is he okay?
-Yeah, he's fine.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.788
But his school wants me there.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.040
How about if we talk about that

02:46.124 --> 02:48.293
when I'm back in Chicago
for work on the 14th?

02:48.376 --> 02:51.004
Or we could talk about it
in the beginning of September

02:51.087 --> 02:55.383
when I'm in New York for the rest of my
life because Lisa and I are moving there.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.135
What?

02:57.218 --> 02:58.094
Why?

02:58.177 --> 03:00.930
For a decade, I've been dragging Lisa
around for teaching jobs

03:01.014 --> 03:02.974
and she was ready to come back home.

03:03.057 --> 03:06.352
So, reunion, right?
The friend group is back!

03:06.436 --> 03:07.812
Yes!

03:11.274 --> 03:12.108
Well...

03:13.067 --> 03:14.110
this is over.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.156
Yes. I was going to say that.
I think that that's best, so...

03:20.491 --> 03:21.868
So where are we now?

03:24.454 --> 03:27.165
["Cut Your Hair" playing]

04:09.499 --> 04:10.458
[horns honking]

04:10.541 --> 04:14.629
[Ethan] Is everything from the waist down
just a swamp for you over there?

04:14.712 --> 04:15.546
Yes.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.466
I feel like I'm wearing more clothes
than I'm actually wearing.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.885
[Lisa] Let's get out of here.
What is happening?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.470
We waiting for this truck to unload?

04:22.553 --> 04:25.431
[male driver] Who taught you how to drive?
You stupid motherfucker!

04:25.515 --> 04:26.474
[horn honks repeatedly]

04:26.557 --> 04:28.059
Do not make eye contact.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.813
-I'm begging you not to--
-Don't talk to my husband like that.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.190
-Come and say that to my face!
-[Ethan] Don't come here.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.566
Fuck you!

04:35.650 --> 04:38.403
I am an attorney, sir!
Watch your fucking mouth!

04:38.486 --> 04:40.238
-Fuck you!
-[mimics driver] Fuck you!

04:40.321 --> 04:43.408
-Oh, fuck you! Fuck you back, you moron!
-[Ethan] Honey, you got him.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.243
Can we just... Honey, please.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.453
I'm sorry, sir. I apologize.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.664
Fuck you, too! Drive, you jackass!

04:49.747 --> 04:51.582
[horn blares]

04:51.666 --> 04:53.209
Thank you for your service.

04:53.751 --> 04:56.087
-[Lisa] He's just a fucking cab driver.
-What? I know.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.339
It's not even our fault,
there's a fucking car...

04:58.423 --> 05:01.092
-I know. What's going on with you?
-I'm fine.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.886
I think I'm just anxious to see everybody.
I'm just...

05:03.970 --> 05:07.515
You know, whenever we get together,
it gets so competitive and immature.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.684
What? With our friends?

05:09.767 --> 05:13.980
Why would that happen? They're only our
best friends. What can possibly go wrong?

05:14.063 --> 05:18.318
We've got 20 years of grievances
built up and ready to explode.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.321
Now this guy's pulling out.
Look at this character!

05:25.491 --> 05:26.326
[excited screaming]

05:26.409 --> 05:27.869
-[Lisa] Marianne!
-Finally!

05:28.786 --> 05:30.079
We're here!

05:30.955 --> 05:32.915
[cheering]

05:32.999 --> 05:33.958
We're here!

05:35.918 --> 05:36.878
We're here!

[enthusiastic whooping]

05:38.379 --> 05:40.631
-[Max] You remember my partner, Felix?
-Hi.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.884
-[Nick] Good to see you.
-[Lisa] Nice to see you.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.928
-Nice to see you again, sir.
-This how we're greeting each other now?

05:46.012 --> 05:46.888
What's so funny?

05:46.971 --> 05:50.850
Oh, in college,
we used to grab each other's testicles.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.270
-That was kind of our funny hello.
-[Nick] Immature, a little bit.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.521
-I see.
-[screaming]

05:56.647 --> 05:58.483
[laughter, overlapping chatter]

05:59.942 --> 06:01.069
So loud.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.862
-Alright, group photo.
-Yeah!

06:03.863 --> 06:05.823
-I'll take it.
-Wait, where's Sam?

06:05.907 --> 06:08.326
[Marianne] Oh, I don't know.
She said she was gonna be here.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.661
That's weird. Friend group back together!

06:10.745 --> 06:12.663
-One, two, three...
-[men screaming]

06:13.206 --> 06:14.040
Alright.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.084
-Felix, come in here.
-Yeah, you get in!

06:16.167 --> 06:17.710
No, it doesn't make any sense.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.254
Get over here, the happy couple.
There we go.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.964
-Alright, just that.
-Oh, yeah!

06:22.048 --> 06:23.674
-[Lisa] That's great.
-[Max] Good.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.469
-[Marianne] Who wants mimosas?
-We do!

06:26.552 --> 06:27.720
[cheering]

06:27.804 --> 06:29.180
Beers! Beers! Beers! Beers!

06:30.389 --> 06:32.600
-It's a lot of energy.
-It's fun.

06:32.683 --> 06:33.643
Very loud.

06:35.770 --> 06:40.024
[Lisa] Just a reminder that last week we
were professional adults living in a house

06:40.108 --> 06:42.193
before we moved here and turned 19 again.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.112
Oh, it's temporary.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.989
Actually, I'm excited
about sleeping on a pull-out.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.493
-Yeah?
-Yeah! Oh, my goodness, there we are!

06:50.576 --> 06:53.204
Wait a second. Oh, there's the bar.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.040
[Sam] <i>So...</i>

06:56.124 --> 06:58.668
How are Froshy and Ethan?

06:59.127 --> 07:01.421
I don't think Lisa loves it
when you call her that.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.380
It's flattering.

07:02.463 --> 07:05.842
It was a dig when we were seniors and
she was a freshman. Now it's a compliment.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.720
-So it has nothing to do with your affair?
-Hey, keep it down.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.348
And why do you insist on calling it
"an affair"?

07:12.849 --> 07:15.852
Because you're married to other people
and having sex with each other.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.981
Ethan was just like a stupid
college hook-up that never ended.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.190
And now we've ended it.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.194
You guys had a 20-year run.
That's more than either of your marriages.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.614
Yeah, well, I have accepted

07:28.698 --> 07:31.409
that you can't have everything you want
all the time.

07:31.492 --> 07:34.537
Ethan and I are done for good. I swear.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.998
-I hope so.
-What is that supposed to mean?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.500
Look, I'm tired of keeping your secret

07:39.584 --> 07:41.627
and I hate that
you made it my secret, too.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.672
-I just want it to be normal.
-So do I.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.549
Then why didn't you come to brunch?

07:47.967 --> 07:49.802
I don't know, okay?

07:49.886 --> 07:51.345
Look, I...

07:51.429 --> 07:55.141
I don't have a plan here.
This is an impossible situation.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.560
You should just call her.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.188
You're right.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.231
[groans]

08:03.608 --> 08:04.442
[Sam sighs heavily]

08:05.651 --> 08:06.777
[line ringing]

08:20.458 --> 08:22.960
-[screams] Froshy, look at you!
-Oh, my God!

08:23.044 --> 08:26.797
You're shrinking! You're like
the incredible shrinking Froshy!

08:26.881 --> 08:29.675
You look so glamorous
for a Tuesday afternoon.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.969
-Oh, I love you! Come on.
-[chuckles]

08:32.053 --> 08:34.931
You know who I'm gonna go see tomorrow?
Felix.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.142
As in Max's boyfriend, Felix?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.228
Professionally, like fertility-wise?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.437
Yeah.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.065
You guys are trying to have a kid?

08:44.148 --> 08:46.943
Well, we're trying.
It's not getting us anywhere, so...

08:47.026 --> 08:48.361
it's time for science.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.278
Yay!

08:50.488 --> 08:51.405
Whoa.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.492
Ethan with a kid, it's, um...
hard to imagine.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.953
I know, I think it's hard
for him to imagine, too.

08:57.828 --> 09:01.791
Gosh, this bed is so comfortable,
I could just fall asleep right here.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.501
I am... [exhales]

09:04.502 --> 09:06.671
I am so optimistic for you guys

09:06.754 --> 09:09.924
and just feeling so positive about this.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.803
I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to buy you this bed.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.805
What? Weird.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.057
-Yeah. Happy housewarming.
-Wait.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.518
No, Sam, that is insane.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.187
-We don't have an apartment yet.
-Too late, bed bought.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.981
Congratulations on your new bed.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.025
Also, let me and Jon
take you guys out for dinner tonight.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.028
This is so fun!
It's awesome to have you guys here!

09:31.487 --> 09:32.572
Raoul!

09:33.614 --> 09:34.448
[sighs]

09:34.532 --> 09:36.492
[Max] So, first of all,
I just have to tell you

09:36.576 --> 09:39.203
that I absolutely loved

09:39.287 --> 09:41.122
the first 60 pages of<i> Before the Storm.</i>

09:41.205 --> 09:43.583
-Max, thank you so much.
-Loved it.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.918
It's my first stab
at a more mainstream thing.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.213
I know I'm very fortunate and blessed,
the critics love my books.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.424
I just want someone to read them.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.134
Because we need the money.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.970
Well, anyway...
I hope it wasn't too corny.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.764
-No! It was the opposite of corny.
-Great, okay.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.268
The idea of exploring race and class
through the lens of a biracial 18-year-old

10:02.351 --> 10:06.188
just months before Hurricane Katrina,
but without the drama of the hurricane.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.066
-Right!
-It was so you, man, it was so...

10:09.150 --> 10:11.068
It was... so you.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.487
Thank you so much, Max.
So what happens next?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.615
I think we're at the end of the road
with this book.

10:16.532 --> 10:17.408
What?

10:17.491 --> 10:20.244
I think this book is no more.
You should stop writing it.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.162
[stammers]

10:21.245 --> 10:24.957
I'm sorry, what kind of sales strategy
is that?<i> Storm</i> is my best seller!

10:25.041 --> 10:27.793
That is not the opinion
of the rest of the team.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.631
Well, why don't you share with me
what the rest of the team has to say?

10:31.714 --> 10:34.550
I'm more than open
to a little constructive criticism.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.385
You're not always...
Sometimes you get a little...

10:36.469 --> 10:39.096
[in goofy voice] Would you mind
sharing your thoughts with me?

10:39.180 --> 10:40.806
'Cause I love to hear the thoughts.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.267
Alright, 'cause you do the voices
when you're uncomfortable.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.811
Let me explain,
sometimes when workshopping books,

10:45.895 --> 10:48.689
and everybody gets on top of each other,
it's not a problem.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.693
-I'm getting the opposite feeling.
-Not a problem.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.155
-That it's a huge problem.
-I love to hear the thoughts, though.

10:56.238 --> 10:59.241
-Well, um... got 'em here.
-[in normal voice] Yeah.

10:59.325 --> 11:03.663
Okay, Donna, who was in a terrible mood,
by the way, she's going through a divorce.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.539
-Max, please.
-She said "really boring."

11:05.623 --> 11:07.833
-She said "really boring"?
-She underlined "really."

11:07.917 --> 11:10.920
-Makes sense she's getting divorced.
-Yeah, that's true.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.963
[goofy voice]
Keep them thoughts a-coming!

11:13.047 --> 11:16.050
Alright. Patel is next up.
He thought it was...

11:17.093 --> 11:20.346
-not entertaining... at all.
-Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.015
-Uh... "I hate this book so much."
-Mm. Mm.

11:23.099 --> 11:27.395
And he put, like, four "O"s.
"Soooo much." "I hate this book," he said.

11:27.478 --> 11:31.774
But don't worry about any of this shit.
I have the answer to all your problems.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.983
I got it.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.568
I'm ready.

11:35.027 --> 11:35.986
Two letters.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.197
Y...

11:39.532 --> 11:40.366
A.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.243
Young Adult.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.495
-I don't think that's for me.
-I don't know.

11:44.578 --> 11:47.206
I do know because I write
literary fiction for adults.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.583
Yes, I know, and you've won awards for it.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.711
-The Pen/Hemingway and the Pushcart Prize.
-Yes, I did.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.172
You won a ton of shit
no one's ever heard of.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.675
-Not no one.
-Look, I know this is hard to hear.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.219
But, Ethan, the great American novel

12:00.302 --> 12:03.305
is now the massive international
young adult series

12:03.389 --> 12:05.182
with film rights and merchandising.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.225
That's the future.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.310
Why are you being so agenty right now?

12:08.394 --> 12:10.938
Your novels all have
teenage protagonists anyway.

12:11.021 --> 12:16.986
So you just have to choose a slightly more
exciting genre-y way in. Okay?

12:17.862 --> 12:20.531
Okay, here's one.
Vampires with cancer. Right?

12:20.614 --> 12:23.075
They live forever,
they die forever, right?

12:23.159 --> 12:27.037
Or work backwards. Start with a title and
then come up with the book. Here's one.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.124
Deathball. What's Deathball?

12:30.207 --> 12:33.627
I don't know, but it sounds awesome,
right? No one survives Deathball.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.089
You and I will crack this. Like the stuff
we wrote together in college.

12:37.173 --> 12:41.302
And it just might become
the next massive international success.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.304
[mimics explosion]

12:46.223 --> 12:49.727
[high-pitched voice] Oh, my God!
It's amazing!

12:49.810 --> 12:51.896
Max, YA is destructive, do you understand?

12:51.979 --> 12:55.816
It's about adults who refuse to grow up
and instead they read books for kids!

12:55.900 --> 12:58.402
It prevents you moving forward
and living your life

12:58.486 --> 13:00.488
and it is destroying our culture!

13:02.406 --> 13:04.909
-So that's a yes? Okay.
-Yes, fuck you, it's a yes.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.661
[Lisa] Thank you so much
for organizing this so last minute.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.081
-This is why we moved to New York, right?
-Yep, friend group.

13:11.165 --> 13:15.836
I found at my last reunion, I didn't have
much in common with my Hofstra friends.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.296
Ah. Well, we got lucky,

13:17.379 --> 13:20.966
because we consider our college friends
to be our family.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.677
My family is my family.

13:23.761 --> 13:24.720
[Jon laughs]

13:25.179 --> 13:27.807
-[Jon] So, what's your deal?
-Oh--

13:27.890 --> 13:30.559
Lisa's an attorney.
You've known her for ten years.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.354
Oh, that's okay. I used to work
for the ACLU in Michigan.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.815
What? So you're a bleeding heart? Aah!

13:36.690 --> 13:40.736
Well, no, not any more. Now I work
as a general counsel for a hedge fund.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.030
-Which one?
-Blackstool Group.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.492
-Is that Degrasso's shop?
-Yeah, it is.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.327
Ah, I like this one.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.828
[Sam] Her name is Lisa.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.541
Lisa, Pisa. Pisa, pizza.
Lisa, Lisa... Got it.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.752
We are just so happy you guys are here.

13:56.835 --> 14:00.214
If there's anything we can do
to ease the transition, let us know.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.800
-Like maybe buying us a bed?
-Oh, my gosh.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.051
I'm sorry, what?

14:04.134 --> 14:07.346
-[Lisa] Sam and Jon bought us a bed today.
-We did?

14:07.429 --> 14:09.765
Wow. Thank you.
That was totally unnecessary.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.226
-I agree.
-It's just a little housewarming gift.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.478
-A four-poster from Holly Hunt.
-Still weird.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.313
[Sam] Anyway, enough about beds.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.941
Yeah, I want to hear
what Max said about<i> Storm.</i>

14:19.692 --> 14:21.026
<i>Storm?</i> What is <i>Storm</i>?

14:21.110 --> 14:25.281
<i>Storm</i> is this amazing novel that Ethan's
been working on for the past two years.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.240
Yeah.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.201
-I don't like fiction. No offense.
-None taken.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.580
My three favorite books,<i> Liar's Poker,</i>
<i>Moneyball</i> and<i> The Big Short.</i>

14:32.663 --> 14:35.165
-So you're a Michael Lewis fan.
-Who's that?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.586
-He's the...
-It's not bestseller stuff, you know.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.714
It's like literary fiction.
There's not a lot of money.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.426
Well, actually, uh...
[stammers] Um...

14:45.885 --> 14:48.429
Max thinks it's going to be a huge sale.

14:48.512 --> 14:51.015
-Flagship property. Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Really?

14:51.265 --> 14:54.101
-Really?
-[Lisa] My God! Honey, that is so amazing!

14:55.394 --> 14:57.938
-[Ethan] Thank you, yes.
-Oh, I am so proud of you!

14:58.022 --> 15:00.816
-Gonna be big money.
-Do you know what? Let's celebrate!

15:00.900 --> 15:03.485
You haven't seen our country house.
You should come.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.531
I'll invite everybody to Connecticut.
I'm not taking no for an answer, Froshy.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.866
This is so great.

15:12.286 --> 15:16.457
Could you believe how hard Ethan
was trying to downplay his book?

15:16.540 --> 15:19.335
He was clearly so excited about it.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.795
Why can't he just admit it?
It's kind of pathetic.

15:21.879 --> 15:23.756
You bought them a bed?

15:23.839 --> 15:27.092
Yes. What is the big deal?
I buy beds for people every day.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.928
Yeah, with their money, not ours.

15:29.011 --> 15:33.015
I know you love your college friends, but
when you see them, you all become bitches,

15:33.098 --> 15:35.100
all the sniping and showing off.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.062
You don't have to show off.
We don't have to compete.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.689
What's the girl's name? Pizza.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.776
-Her name is not Pizza, it's Lisa.
-Right, yeah.

15:43.859 --> 15:47.529
And I'm not competing with them,
I'm talking about them, I'm processing.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.323
I'm trying to download with you.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.909
Why won't you do that with me?
You make me feel crazy.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.662
They live their lives, we live ours.
It's irrelevant.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.706
I don't spend my time
thinking about people other than us.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.541
I think about whether you're happy.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.044
I think about
whether our children are happy.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.754
That's what matters to me.

16:04.421 --> 16:05.589
[whistles]

16:08.133 --> 16:10.010
[giggling]

16:15.891 --> 16:19.603
Yeah, so, we've been trying, really,
for about a year now.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.438
-Yeah.
-A year? That's it?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.399
That's not very long. Why are you here?

16:23.482 --> 16:27.486
Well, we haven't used protection
in, like, eight years.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.989
-I'd say eight years, yeah.
-Alright.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.409
But that's pretty average, right,
for somebody...

16:33.492 --> 16:36.620
-That's normal, right?
-Well, it's good that you're here.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.707
Yeah, right, okay.

16:39.790 --> 16:43.043
And I see you had one pregnancy
that was terminated after six weeks.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.754
-Yeah, that was in college.
-It's before my time.

16:49.383 --> 16:53.137
None of your labs look out of the ordinary
and your ultrasound looks good.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.180
So we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.099
-Good, fantastic.
-Amazing.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.602
And in the meantime,
maybe stop grabbing each other's balls.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.646
Oh, okay, yes, I'll make a note of that.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.314
No, I was joking.

17:04.398 --> 17:08.652
When we met, you guys had your handshake
and you were grabbing each other's balls.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.405
-When you... with Max.
-When we met you at Marianne's.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.698
And don't wear a Speedo.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.283
[both chuckling]

17:14.366 --> 17:16.285
-Right.
-Correct dress. We will not...

17:16.368 --> 17:18.203
No, I'm serious, don't wear a Speedo.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.040
-Oh, you're saying... Okay, that's real.
-Correct.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.126
-We understand now, I think.
-Presto change-o, don't wear the Speedo.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.127
Alright.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.670
And don't get in a hot tub!

17:30.382 --> 17:32.342
Oh, and before you go...

17:33.302 --> 17:37.639
I just want to write down
the cost of this, after insurance,

17:37.723 --> 17:39.641
so we're all on the same page.

17:39.725 --> 17:44.438
If you have any questions,
please feel free to let us know, alright?

17:45.439 --> 17:47.024
-Mm-hmm.
-[very high-pitched] Yeah.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.736
-[even higher] Yeah.
-Okay? Alright?

17:51.612 --> 17:55.783
Does this include
the friends and family discount?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.494
-Sure.
-Yeah.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.663
-Thank you.
-Good luck. We will talk soon.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.416
-Let me know if you have any questions.
-Thank you.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.126
-Bye-bye. You got it.
-Talk soon.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.544
Oh, and don't get a massage.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.755
-Sorry, who?
-What? Don't get a massage?

18:09.838 --> 18:10.839
-Right.
-Okay.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.593
That's a joke. Someone said
I was too rigid on a comment card.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.136
-Okay.
-Okay, thank you.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.138
[Felix] Okay, this is over. Goodbye.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.351
No, you didn't, Edward.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.937
I don't know which guy I would choose.

18:27.397 --> 18:31.276
[Sam] <i>Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>you and Lisa were trying to have a kid?</i>

18:32.694 --> 18:36.365
[Ethan] <i>Why did you buy us a bed?</i>

18:36.448 --> 18:38.075
<i>Yours, Ethan.</i>

18:40.202 --> 18:42.454
[Sam] <i>Why are you sending me texts?</i>

18:42.538 --> 18:43.705
<i>Delete immediately.</i>

18:44.331 --> 18:46.750
[Ethan] <i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>this is Marianne's computer.</i>

18:46.834 --> 18:48.377
<i>Yours, Ethan.</i>

18:50.254 --> 18:52.589
<i>Oh, no! This is Marianne's computer.</i>

18:52.673 --> 18:53.715
<i>Yours, Ethan.</i>

18:54.341 --> 18:55.551
[metal rattling]

18:59.972 --> 19:00.889
Oh.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.058
Just the rabbit.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.060
This is so typical of Sam.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.396
We're all here, living in the same city,

19:07.479 --> 19:09.982
and yet we have to schlep out
to Connecticut to see her.

19:10.065 --> 19:13.110
Yeah. You'll really love her house,
though, it's beautiful.

19:13.193 --> 19:16.446
Of course it's beautiful.
Everything Sam touches is beautiful.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.449
She makes me feel so inferior,
like I suck or something.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.578
It's like she's always a senior
and I'm a permanent freshman.

19:22.661 --> 19:26.331
-She literally still calls me Froshy.
-I know, honey, it's horrible.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.418
-I just had to get that off my chest.
-Yeah, I know.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.879
And I think Froshy
is a term of endearment, to be honest.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.714
-I don't think it is.
-I think it is.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.048
[Marianne] It's really cute.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.927
-[Ethan] Hey, can we put the top down?
-[Lisa] That sounds fun!

19:39.011 --> 19:41.889
[Marianne]
It's a funny story. No, I cannot.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.851
-[Ethan] Okay. I'll give it a crack.
-[Marianne] Oh, please don't.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.147
-[Ethan] There we go.
-[Lisa] That's nice.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.815
There we go.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.151
There we go.

19:55.777 --> 19:59.031
-It's just stuck there, isn't it?
-Yeah. Do you want to drive?

20:00.157 --> 20:01.408
Yeah, no, I'll drive.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.702
It's like a car sail.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.495
Hey, can you see out the back?

20:05.579 --> 20:06.413
No.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.498
This seems dangerous.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.002
[engine revs]

20:12.085 --> 20:13.212
What are you doing?

20:16.465 --> 20:17.716
-Whoa!
-[tires screech]

20:17.799 --> 20:21.887
-[chuckles] Well, problem solved.
-We'll pay for that.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.849
[Ethan] Look at this thing. It's like
we're in a <i>Black Mirror</i> episode.

20:26.892 --> 20:27.726
Huh.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.729
-Stupid-looking truck.
-At least it has a roof.

20:31.688 --> 20:32.814
[Ethan giggles]

20:32.898 --> 20:35.150
Look at how she's dressed.
This is <i>Black Mirror.</i>

20:35.234 --> 20:37.236
Hi! It's so good to see you guys!

20:37.319 --> 20:39.488
-[Sam] Thank you for coming.
-[Lisa] Hey, how are you?

20:39.571 --> 20:42.741
-Good! Come on in. Hi!
-Hey.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.618
-Hey, good to see you.
-Hi, yeah.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.661
-Okay.
-You, too.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.663
[Lisa] Whose car is that out front?

20:47.746 --> 20:50.791
It's mine. I got it as my early
40th birthday present to myself.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.751
I don't care if you don't like it.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.962
-Did you guys see that car out front?
-Yeah.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.964
Do you think it transforms
into a giant asshole?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.092
Guys, no, listen, listen, listen. Guys.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.971
Seriously. There are plenty of YA novels
that are every bit as good as adult books.

21:04.054 --> 21:04.888
What?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.849
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>
gave birth to the entire genre.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.602
-Harper Lee is a national treasure.
-[Marianne] I love Judy Blume.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.355
<i>Harry Potter.</i>
I'd read one of those books every year.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.274
I mean, it's all I have time for.

21:15.357 --> 21:17.693
You don't work. You have nothing but time.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.697
Whatever. Why don't you go get
in your truck and go find Jason Bourne?

21:24.366 --> 21:28.161
JK Rowling's a modern-day Dickens,
except better and more successful.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.831
-That's true.
-You guys, you cannot be serious.

21:30.914 --> 21:35.794
YA is not great literature. I mean,
it's literally for undeveloped minds.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.588
I could not disagree with you
more emphatically.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.882
Honey,<i> Catcher in the Rye</i>
is essentially YA.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.760
That is a novel about a young person,

21:43.844 --> 21:48.390
not trash about teens in the future
with bows and arrows.

21:48.473 --> 21:52.894
Why do you need bows and arrows in
the future? Like, I don't understand it.

21:52.978 --> 21:57.858
No, I like those<i> Hunger Game</i> movies
starring that girl.

21:57.941 --> 22:01.945
They're exciting but you always know
they're gonna turn out okay.

22:02.654 --> 22:05.282
Oh, my God. Nobody listen to him.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.411
Well, you know, I just think that YA

22:09.494 --> 22:12.998
is the most interesting thing
happening in fiction today.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.541
-What?
-Hear, hear.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.043
-I do.
-You don't think that.

22:16.126 --> 22:20.672
And for good reason. Your last book
was a<i> New York Times</i> notable book.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.632
I mean, you're a great writer.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.093
There's no way you can like this stuff.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.513
Ethan and I also talked about
the commercial side of publishing.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.098
Yes, like<i> Storm.</i>

22:30.182 --> 22:32.934
I mean, that is a novel for adults.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.521
And like, Max, you said,
this is a flagship property.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.149
And you did that without vampires

22:39.232 --> 22:42.527
and kids running around mazes
or whatever they're doing now.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.030
<i>Storm's</i> dead.
We're not going to sell<i> Storm.</i>

22:45.697 --> 22:46.531
What?

22:49.284 --> 22:50.494
What?

22:50.577 --> 22:51.953
[Max] I thought...

22:52.871 --> 22:56.083
I thought that's why
we were talking about... YA.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.709
I'm sorry, I didn't...

22:57.793 --> 23:01.129
Never mind. I didn't...
I didn't realize that you hadn't...

23:02.130 --> 23:03.590
I shouldn't have.

23:04.633 --> 23:08.303
I'm sorry, I'm confused. Why did you say
that you were going to sell it?

23:09.179 --> 23:10.764
I mean, we were out...

23:12.015 --> 23:15.393
We were at dinner and you announced it.
We celebrated with champagne.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.396
Well, we were almost at a sale of it,
right?

23:18.480 --> 23:20.524
We... talked about selling it.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.692
And then everyone read it

23:22.776 --> 23:26.071
and decided to not... to not sell it.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.866
So why would you tell me that you sold it?

23:30.784 --> 23:32.744
Because I knew you'd overreact.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.288
Because all you guys
have had this expectation,

23:35.372 --> 23:37.582
that was born in college when I was 18,

23:37.666 --> 23:42.003
that I was going to be some kind of famous
Nobel-Prize-winning author.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.381
[Nick] I don't.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.925
I think you're pretty good, but...

23:47.008 --> 23:48.760
-But, like, a Nobel Prize?
-Yeah.

23:48.844 --> 23:52.264
I'm sorry to disappoint the rest
of you, but it's not going to happen.

23:52.347 --> 23:56.101
I'm not going to leap into the literary
pantheon, which no longer exists.

23:56.184 --> 23:59.729
-Can you back me up on this, Max?
-I don't know what is safe to talk about.

23:59.813 --> 24:00.814
Just back me up on it.

24:01.731 --> 24:02.858
It's fading.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.485
So I'm doing a YA now,
that's what I'm going to do.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.281
[Jon] If you want something funny
to write about,

24:09.364 --> 24:14.327
a few months ago, Dashiell called one
of his classmates at school the C word.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.415
-Cunt.
-Yeah.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.750
-Oh, my God.
-Well, I...

24:20.834 --> 24:22.419
Excuse me.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.390
I'm sorry, Ethan,
I thought you told her about<i> Storm.</i>

24:35.473 --> 24:36.725
It's okay.

24:36.808 --> 24:40.187
It's something you would tell your wife,
something you talk about.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.772
-[goofy voice] I already said it's okay.
-Alright.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.403
[sighs] Well.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.365
[chuckles] Yeah.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.452
What is so bad about "cunt"?

24:56.244 --> 24:58.872
Well, it's extremely offensive to women.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.749
-Is it?
-Yeah.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.210
-Really?
-Yeah, I would say so.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.630
But it's like, what can you say any more?

25:06.713 --> 25:08.840
I feel like they've taken everything away.

25:08.924 --> 25:12.719
When they came for "retarded,"
I said nothing, you know?

25:12.802 --> 25:15.889
When they came for "that's so gay,"
I said nothing.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.892
But it's like, you got to draw
the line somewhere, you know?

25:18.975 --> 25:20.977
It's like you can't take away "cunt."

25:21.061 --> 25:22.270
You can't...

25:23.188 --> 25:24.522
take away "cunt"!

25:25.857 --> 25:28.652
-It's such a great fucking word.
-Give me this.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.074
Oh, my God, that's so good.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.580
Why would you bring Dashiell up?
That is not a funny dinner party story.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.874
It's not funny!

25:42.958 --> 25:45.001
I can't tell a story about my own son?

25:45.085 --> 25:47.754
-I don't understand the code here.
-There's no code.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.756
I'm ashamed of Dashiell's behavior

25:49.839 --> 25:53.301
and I don't want you dining out on it,
especially around my friends.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.928
See, that's what this is about.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.972
Sorry I didn't go to Harvard with you.

25:57.055 --> 26:00.725
You get off on acting like you're too good
for me around them. It's bullshit.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.853
Telling me to be quiet
at my own dinner table?

26:03.937 --> 26:06.690
You're all living in the past.
You should let the past go.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.858
The present's a pretty cool place to be.

26:08.942 --> 26:13.196
You know what I don't understand? I don't
understand how he even knows that word.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.864
Do you use that word?

26:14.948 --> 26:16.283
Do you?

26:16.366 --> 26:17.492
Do you?

26:18.076 --> 26:20.495
"Judgmental Cunt" is a Kid Cudi song.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.372
He heard it in my car.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.291
A four-year-old?

26:24.374 --> 26:27.043
-He's four years old!
-It's a catchy song.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.713
-He should be listening to Raffi!
-He prefers Kid Cudi!

26:29.796 --> 26:32.465
You and I both know Raffi sucks!

-No.

-Oh! Yes, seal thing!
-Oh! Seal thing.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.047
[Ethan] What are you doing?

28:36.673 --> 28:38.341
Cleaning up the playroom.

28:41.636 --> 28:44.139
Hey, did you lie about your book
to impress me?

28:48.059 --> 28:49.018
Yes.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.771
Uh, yes, I did. I did do that.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.149
One hundred percent.

28:57.277 --> 28:58.403
Did it work?
