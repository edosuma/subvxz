- Man, I love that gadget.

00:10.009 --> 00:12.387
- I said you owed me
one, remember?

00:12.470 --> 00:16.099
- Oh, right.

00:16.181 --> 00:21.062
- Well, I know what
I want that one to be.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.231
- [sighing]
Fine. Bring it on, Preppy.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.024
What do you want?
To borrow my tools?

00:25.108 --> 00:26.276
Me to clean your room?

00:26.359 --> 00:28.361
I'm not gonna be
your servant for the day.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.613
- No, I don't want
any of that stuff.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.659
I just thought, you know...

00:34.743 --> 00:37.162
maybe you and I could...

00:39.456 --> 00:41.875
go out sometime.

Wow, Preppy.
Okay, good one.

Okay, okay, I'll clean your
room, all right,

00:48.548 --> 00:50.133
but I'm not doing
your laundry.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.718
I'm allergic
to collared shirts.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.636
- I'm serious.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.474
- So am I.
I get all itchy.

00:57.557 --> 01:01.060
- So, you don't
wanna go out?

01:01.144 --> 01:04.438
- Oh, come on. We're not
"go out" material.

01:04.522 --> 01:08.401
I'm me and you're...

01:08.485 --> 01:08.985

cousin at Thanksgiving

01:09.068 --> 01:12.197

- I'm glad you have such
a high opinion of me.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.328
I promise--no paste.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.038
- It's just not
who we are.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.916
I mean, we're competitors,
who are friends,

01:22.999 --> 01:25.251

the same thing.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.880

01:28.963 --> 01:31.508
You will go out
with me, Andi Cruz.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.886

at the table, my friend.

from you guys.

01:50.109 --> 01:51.444

that there have been

free ice cream

02:34.153 --> 02:37.574
and National Sunscreen Day
all at the same time.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.368
- Why do you keep
staring at it?

02:40.451 --> 02:42.161
It's not going to change.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.289
- Because I can't believe it.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.540
It's like a mirage,

02:45.623 --> 02:47.542
but a mirage is something
you want to see.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.145

You must build a shield

Designs must be chosen
and the first stage of building

03:16.154 --> 03:22.327
must be completed
by the end of the day.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.747
But there's something
new to this assignment.

03:25.830 --> 03:30.960
We are instituting
a WIT Switch.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.589
You will not work with

03:34.672 --> 03:38.301
Points will be

You will have to work

03:45.391 --> 03:48.978

Quick--what's

05:00.466 --> 05:02.719
you can make
a shield out of?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.429
- Paper?

05:04.512 --> 05:07.348
Maybe the thin plastic
you wrap vegetables in?

05:07.432 --> 05:11.352
- Ruby will have
Jessie and Ben.

this "Kim" girl?

nice and cool.

05:26.784 --> 05:27.577
There she is.

05:27.660 --> 05:32.749
- Does she have
all your contact numbers?

05:32.832 --> 05:36.544
- Oh, and before
I continue, I must add--

05:36.627 --> 05:40.882
no WIT may confer about shields
with their usual Guardian.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.384
If any problems arise,

05:43.468 --> 05:46.596
Cameron will be
available to aid you.

06:00.401 --> 06:00.985

a space here?

06:01.069 --> 06:02.695
What are we missing?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.280
- Well, since Team Preppy's
in first place,

06:04.363 --> 06:05.406
he got to choose
the materials

06:05.490 --> 06:07.700
and design he
wanted first.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.454
Okay, I guess we need
to pick a design.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.122
- How about this?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.166
- That's not really
a design.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.167
- No, it is.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.502
This is how big
your shield should be.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.797
- Oh, because it's so small,
it wouldn't protect me at all.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.841
[laughing]
I get it.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.135
Do you remember when Aggie said
that "points will be handled

06:26.219 --> 06:28.513
individually for
this assignment?"

06:28.596 --> 06:29.514
- Yeah. So?

06:29.597 --> 06:31.974
- So, if my shield doesn't
work, we all fail.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.810
- And we also
get no points.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.313
- Fine.

06:37.396 --> 06:38.523
- If we all do well,

06:38.606 --> 06:42.985
we all take the points back
to the teams we know and love.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.821
- Come on, Emily,
it'll be fun.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.782
For this week,
we're Team Extremo Supremo.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.201
- Unfortunately,
that's already taken.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.869
How about
the "One Week Club"?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.789
- One week? That'll
feel like a year.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.043
- SEAN: Where's Kim?
She's late.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.044
- Not a good
first impression.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.003
- What are you doing?

07:01.087 --> 07:05.007
- Writing a letter
to Luke.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.010
- Gracie, he's still
in the building.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.597
- Andi broke his heart

07:11.681 --> 07:13.558
and he needs to know
we're here for him.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.685
- KIM: All right, guys,
let's rock this out.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.019
- Whoa, is that
a Wizard Whoopdidoo?

07:17.103 --> 07:20.606
- Yeah, I made it myself.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.482
I tweaked the wiring
so it's compatible

07:21.566 --> 07:24.068
with everything
else on my belt.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.615
- Is it child-safe?
- Of course.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.908
- Just checking.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.702
You were so late,

07:32.785 --> 07:33.828
I thought maybe you broke
the rules whenever you wanted.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.414
- No, I was late because

07:36.497 --> 07:38.833
I thought this would
help us build our shield.

07:38.916 --> 07:39.250
What are you working on?

07:39.333 --> 07:40.042
- It's private.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.295
- All right, you know what?

07:42.378 --> 07:45.256
I'll go research some
ancient shield designs

07:45.339 --> 07:47.717
while you guys
finish up, okay?

07:47.800 --> 07:48.301
- GRACIE: Okay.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.052
This letter isn't enough.

07:50.136 --> 07:54.348
Luke needs to charm Andi.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.225
He needs to be romantic.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.270
- He's not really
the romantic type.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.232
- What if we gave
him a magic...push?

08:03.316 --> 08:03.774
Once he puts his
heart into it,

08:03.858 --> 08:06.944
she'll have to say "yes."

08:07.028 --> 08:08.654
- Wait up!

08:11.699 --> 08:12.909
There he is.

08:12.992 --> 08:13.534
- Ready?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.746
- We got the choicest stuff,

08:16.829 --> 08:19.665
so it's really about
staying focused.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.417
- GRACIE &amp; SEAN:
For Luke to stand a chance,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.544
he has to use romance!
[powers zapping]

08:27.673 --> 08:33.429
- Hey, guys, I'm thinking...
you got this handled.

08:33.511 --> 08:37.433
I need a haircut
and some new clothes.

08:37.515 --> 08:39.559
- I like the "Teardrop" design

08:39.644 --> 08:41.479
It's easy to move and has
extended leg protection.

08:41.562 --> 08:46.108
- But the "Heater" design
has a wide body.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.401
What do you think
it's gonna be like

08:47.485 --> 08:47.944
having a Guardian that
isn't a regular human?

08:48.027 --> 08:50.947
- I don't know,

08:51.030 --> 08:54.951
but Ruby has been giving
Andi a lot of trouble.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.118
- We've just gotta
get to know her.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.455
Maybe there's a side to her
that we haven't seen yet.

08:59.538 --> 09:02.375
- I don't like this
anymore than you do.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.794
But we all have
to succeed together.

09:04.877 --> 09:05.795
- Failure is not an option.

09:05.878 --> 09:10.174
- That's right and I will
never fail again.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.386
Here's the design
I think we should use.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.973
- This looks more like
a tank than a shield.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.475
- The best offense
is often the best defense.

09:19.558 --> 09:20.476
- Can we use this many spikes?

09:20.559 --> 09:22.061
- Nothing in the rules
against sharp objects.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.313
- What are these lines here?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.815
- Those are flames.

09:25.898 --> 09:26.899
- Where are you going?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.484
- I have to look
into hot tar.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.986
You guys--start building.

09:30.069 --> 09:30.987
- I'm a little concerned.
