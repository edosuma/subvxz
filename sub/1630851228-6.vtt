that would benefit

11:45.792 --> 11:49.317
from her still being alive,
spilling her many secrets?

11:49.360 --> 11:52.363
- Is your government
trying to find Bridget?

11:52.407 --> 11:56.367
- Agent Forrester, Iran,
like Pakistan,

11:56.411 --> 12:00.502
we're one of nine nations
that has nuclear weapons.

12:00.545 --> 12:05.942
Pakistan has been repeatedly
attacked with terrorist plots,

12:05.986 --> 12:07.727
which makes its intentions

12:07.770 --> 12:10.555
for nuclear proliferation
very worrisome.

12:10.599 --> 12:11.948
So this is a very--

12:11.992 --> 12:14.037
- Ali, I understand the issues
that you deal with

12:14.081 --> 12:17.301
every day are very stressful,
and there is a decent shot

12:17.345 --> 12:20.043
that the world is going
to hell in a handbasket,

12:20.087 --> 12:22.176
but we are here
to find Bridget.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.483
So let's just get to the part
where we find out

12:25.527 --> 12:28.660
why someone would want
to take her.

12:28.704 --> 12:32.752
- It's because she has
the perfect knowledge

12:32.795 --> 12:34.754
of all of the players,

12:34.797 --> 12:37.017
all the secrets they wish
to keep hidden,

12:37.060 --> 12:39.410
all the secrets
they use to get results.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.936
- And this perfect knowledge
is a bargaining chip

12:42.979 --> 12:45.982
for any country to get others
to bend to their will?

12:46.026 --> 12:51.814
- That's a tad aggressive.
My job requires more diplomacy.

12:51.858 --> 12:55.122
- The job you just lost.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.819
- I'm approaching retirement.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.430
- You can't be 50 yet.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.389
We heard it was more of a
replacement than a retirement.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.913
- You are debating semantics

13:03.957 --> 13:05.393
when the end result
is the same.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.525
- Because your new partner
doesn't see the process

13:07.569 --> 13:09.614
as diplomatically as you do?

13:09.658 --> 13:13.618
- Hm. Let's put it this way.

13:13.662 --> 13:18.058
I won't be retiring
near any large city centers.

collecting her own blood.

To keep it fresh
in vacuum tubes,

14:45.101 --> 14:46.755
an anticoagulant is added.

14:46.798 --> 14:52.935
And without that, the blood
should've congealed by now.

this crime scene was staged.

Standard motivations
for betraying your country.

thing she did to distract us.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.447
Make us believe she's hidden,
bleeding out somewhere.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.232
