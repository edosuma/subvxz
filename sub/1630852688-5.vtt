00:15.760 --> 00:17.919
Jaca is the place where I grew up.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.320
Where I have my childhood memories.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.400
It's where I danced.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.559
Enjoyed my family's love.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.080
And all of that has shaped me.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.600
Let me open the window a bit
so I can smell the country air.

00:54.440 --> 00:57.239
I hadn't been back to Jaca in nine years.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.440
It felt as if
what I'd lived hadn't happened.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.400
I became the same girl that left.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.280
I feel like a little girl.

01:05.360 --> 01:08.800
I remember when my mom would drive me
in the car down these roads.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.200
Oh, how we loved a little drive
after school.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.479
We would fall asleep.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.280
After school we were so tired.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.280
In my mom's slow, little old car.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.320
As the years go by, I think
we have a lot of things in common.

01:27.399 --> 01:31.119
Her life story, her family story…
It's very similar to mine.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.920
Different factors
with different objectives,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.240
but very similar in a lot of aspects.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.640
That's why it was interesting,
after knowing her a little bit better,

01:41.199 --> 01:43.560
to see what kind of woman she is…

01:43.640 --> 01:48.399
Not from an aesthetic point of view
or what she has now, our beautiful family,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.720
but what lies behind her.

01:53.399 --> 01:57.320
A song… One song has just popped
into my head.

01:58.199 --> 02:00.600
The one we'd sing the Virgin Mary
at school.

02:01.800 --> 02:05.559
The one that goes,
<i>Morning star, evening glow…</i>

02:12.920 --> 02:14.880
<i>Mary of Nazareth.</i>

02:15.600 --> 02:18.799
JACA, SPAIN

02:30.080 --> 02:31.280
So long ago.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.120
We used to walk this way to go to school,

02:33.200 --> 02:35.880
to go to ballet class,
to come back from ballet class.

02:35.959 --> 02:37.840
Are the deer there? Let's go up.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.280
One of the things
I missed the most about Jaca

02:43.959 --> 02:45.080
is its nature.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.600
The walks to the river with my mom.

02:48.200 --> 02:51.600
Spending so many afternoons
doing my homework in the country,

02:52.360 --> 02:55.360
eating sandwiches,
picking blackberries to make jam,

02:55.440 --> 02:58.280
going to get milk to make custard
on Sundays with my mom.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.480
- There's so much pollen.
- Yes.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.799
Nothing's changed, right?
Holy mother.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.799
How many years we spent here
in the citadel, strolling around…

03:08.320 --> 03:10.440
I haven't been here in nine years but…

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
it's as if I was here yesterday.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.399
- Right?
- Yes.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.200
I'm kind of in shock.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.080
My life in Jaca was really pretty.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.440
Surrounded by a lot of love, nature.

03:23.519 --> 03:25.840
Look! I was just looking there
in the distance.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.880
- The little houses you liked.
- That was my dream home.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.640
- You always--
- "I'll live here when I grow up."

03:31.720 --> 03:32.920
"I'll buy this house."

03:33.560 --> 03:35.480
Yes, that was always your dream house.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.760
Look at the deer.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.280
- We scared them off.
- Fawn.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.200
- Okay, let's go eat.
- So, are we eating?

03:43.280 --> 03:44.640
- Yes, I'm hungry.
- Awesome.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.040
Georgina!

03:52.119 --> 03:53.679
- Beautiful!

03:55.160 --> 03:56.959
- Beautiful!

03:57.560 --> 03:59.480
Everyone's got their phones.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.880
I wasn't expecting
to cause such a stir in Jaca.

04:02.959 --> 04:06.679
Besides, I couldn't understand it,
because I feel I'm still the same.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.839
I've known you
since you were a little girl.

04:08.920 --> 04:09.799
Yes?

04:11.799 --> 04:15.799
At the end, they are the same people
as I am the same person.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.680
It was a surprise.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.880
It has changed a lot, hasn't it?

04:20.680 --> 04:23.039
- Remember how many toys we bought here?
- Yes.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.640
- Diego!
- How are you?

04:24.720 --> 04:26.039
- Great.
- Cool.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.520
- He was in my class.
- Hmm.

04:27.599 --> 04:30.039
Look at Mario. He was also in your class.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.800
- Where is he?
- There.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.800
- Mario. How are you?
- Hi!

04:34.760 --> 04:36.640
- Is it still a toy store?
- No.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.080
- Ah!
- Well it is nice seeing you.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.400
- Take care.
- Bye.

04:40.479 --> 04:41.640
She looks attractive.

04:41.720 --> 04:43.039
I'm going to buy a lottery ticket.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.840
I used to buy a lot of tickets here
when I was little.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.039
I like to do the lottery,
because I believe I'll win some day.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.479
Are you going to follow me
with your little camera all day?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.880
I never thought
there would be paparazzi in Jaca.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.760
No way!
They don't sell candy here anymore.

05:02.039 --> 05:03.479
Yes, they changed it.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.000
There's candy, right?

05:05.599 --> 05:06.880
Hello, girls. Yes.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.720
- So many memories.
- We'd always buy candy here as kids.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.560
- Oh, great.
- I'm going to get some.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.479
- If I had five or ten cents, I'd come.
- For five cents--

05:16.560 --> 05:18.280
For five cents,
I could get one gummy.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.120
With five cents,
we could get one gum ball.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.880
I'll get some
for the babies' birthday.

05:23.479 --> 05:25.599
I mean, everything at once. Everything.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.240
I'm becoming a little girl,
anxious to get all the candy I see.

05:31.160 --> 05:35.200
I haven't been able to stop eating candy,
and I don't think I ever will.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.760
I think I was more addicted
to candy in the past.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.280
I loved them when I was a little girl.
I'd become crazy.

05:43.359 --> 05:46.280
As time goes by, to be honest,
I eat less than before.

05:46.359 --> 05:47.840
Also, because…

05:48.760 --> 05:50.440
it's starting to show.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.599
I'm older.
My babies also have a sweet tooth.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.080
What's the damage?

05:59.160 --> 06:01.359
It'll be 95 euros, please.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.599
- Right.
- Done.

06:04.599 --> 06:06.400
No, keep the change.

06:11.039 --> 06:12.440
- Hi!
- Hi.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.160
Georgina, were you excited
to come back home?

06:15.800 --> 06:16.640
Of course.

06:17.479 --> 06:19.919
Mother, Jaca's all fired up.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.479
The neighbors are freaking out.

06:23.919 --> 06:26.080
BIARRITZ ROTISSERIE

06:26.160 --> 06:27.000
Hi.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.359
- How are you both?
- Very well, yes.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.320
Great.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.400
- It hasn't changed as you can see.
- Yes, yes.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.320
For me, Restaurant Biarritz

06:36.400 --> 06:38.599
is a place we couldn't afford
when we were little,

06:38.680 --> 06:40.640
and I dreamt of eating there.

06:41.479 --> 06:44.280
- So many memories.
- I'm dying to sit down.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.080
Phew! It's so hot.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.720
It was very emotional to go back to Jaca

06:51.799 --> 06:54.120
and have the chance
to eat at that restaurant.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.960
It was like, "Well, life can change."

06:57.799 --> 07:01.039
Do you remember?
We never used to come here as kids.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.000
Right.

07:03.039 --> 07:07.840
I only came here, I think,
a couple of times with ballet class.

07:07.919 --> 07:09.520
- Me too.
- For end of school year.

07:09.599 --> 07:10.640
Hmm.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.160
Well, of course,
this was a nice restaurant.

07:14.239 --> 07:16.239
- Yes.
- And we couldn't afford it.

07:21.200 --> 07:24.479
In the past,
I used to see it from the outside

07:25.039 --> 07:28.919
and now, I'm here sitting down,
enjoying a meal with my sister,

07:29.000 --> 07:29.880
and I'm happy.

07:30.520 --> 07:31.520
Yes, but look…

07:32.159 --> 07:34.400
Now I always go
to all the best restaurants,

07:34.479 --> 07:35.840
- and I miss…
- The plans…

07:35.919 --> 07:39.200
…when we were kids
and Mom would take us to eat sandwiches.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.039
Our outings were beautiful.

07:43.359 --> 07:45.239
I remember I was very lazy.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.080
I was very little and my mom would take us
through the mountains.

07:51.479 --> 07:52.359
I'm sorry.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.120
- I'd have loved to invite Mommy and Dad.
- Mm-hmm.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.719
When he died,

08:08.679 --> 08:12.280
my life changed. Also my work.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.679
I know it's him. He's the light.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.919
In fact, the day
I learned of my father's death,

08:18.760 --> 08:21.320
I was signing my first fashion contract.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.840
And…

08:22.919 --> 08:24.359
And, well…

08:24.440 --> 08:27.239
On my birthday, I remember I had a plan

08:27.320 --> 08:30.679
to celebrate in Turin
with my kids, my mom, my sister.

08:31.239 --> 08:32.240
Cris had a match,

08:32.319 --> 08:36.159
and, well, I had to travel to Argentina
for his funeral.

08:36.720 --> 08:40.280
It was a bit of a strange birthday.
I mean, I'd never have imagined that.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.520
But I know that happened
because my father wanted to be there,

08:44.600 --> 08:47.120
one way or another, for my birthday.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.160
He'd been sick in the hospital
for a long time.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.800
But I believe that…

08:53.880 --> 08:56.720
and I feel his presence.
I know he's with me.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.600
Often I talk to him and pray to him.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.400
And I never feel alone.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.840
Same as when I was a little girl,

09:02.920 --> 09:05.720
even though we didn't spend
as much time together

09:05.800 --> 09:07.440
as we both would have liked,

09:07.520 --> 09:08.840
he was always there.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.400
I was his little girl.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.920
I wasn't his favorite child because
I don't think parents have favorites.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.120
And I know he didn't have favorites,
but we had very similar personalities.

09:37.800 --> 09:38.839
Yes.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.720
I thought that coming to Jaca…

09:58.800 --> 10:00.800
was going to be a euphoric experience.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.120
However, I feel melancholic.

10:03.199 --> 10:04.839
I think our best memory is…

10:04.920 --> 10:07.839
- Ballet for me. Yes.
- …the academy. The ballet academy.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.600
- The ballet academy.
- School.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.839
- Not for me!

10:12.520 --> 10:16.240
When we started school at 9:15 a.m.
and the nuns would come for me?

10:16.320 --> 10:17.400
The troublemaker?

10:17.480 --> 10:20.680
You'd make such a fuss about school.
I loved it.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.520
- I always missed the first hour…
- You were so dramatic.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.160
"Mom, don't abandon me."

10:26.839 --> 10:28.720
I really didn't like going to school.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.680
I was scared of the nuns…
…and they were the teachers.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.360
I felt really lonely at school.

10:34.440 --> 10:37.199
My mom thought I was autistic
because I loved to be by myself,

10:37.280 --> 10:39.600
at peace in my own world.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.640
That's why she signed me up for ballet.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.839
Later, the ballet teachers told her,
"She's <i>not </i>autistic."

10:45.400 --> 10:47.760
It's just that
I didn't really fit in at the park,

10:47.839 --> 10:49.920
or at school with my classmates.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.440
Maybe we just didn't vibe.
There wasn't a connection with them.

10:54.760 --> 10:56.320
Hmm, to Jaca,

10:56.400 --> 10:59.079
and because we are what we are thanks to…

10:59.160 --> 11:01.160
- All we've gone through.
- Our childhood.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.240
We've given each other
the strength we needed.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.560
Yes.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.480
It wouldn't be the same, I mean…

11:08.560 --> 11:11.360
I can't imagine my life
without my sister.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.240
I think that adversity made us closer.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.120
Also, our experiences…

11:16.199 --> 11:19.760
I think we protect each other so much
because we've lived through tough times.

11:19.839 --> 11:21.640
SUSANA ARA MARRACO
DANCE ACADEMY

11:22.360 --> 11:24.600
Extend, listen to the music.

11:28.079 --> 11:30.600
And the hand in second…

11:32.040 --> 11:35.600
Two, three, four, soutenu, five, six…

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
Tendu and close. And soutenu.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.800
How are you, Susana?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.440
- How are you?
- Great.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.800
- It's been so long.
- Yes.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.360
I was Georgina's ballet teacher, well,
since she was three or four years old

11:56.440 --> 11:58.800
until she left it when she was 16.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.400
Do you remember when you were very little,

12:01.480 --> 12:03.480
and we staged a little thing
like the <i>Swan Lake?</i>

12:03.560 --> 12:06.040
- All dressed up like swans?
- Yes. My first performance.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.719
Well, I remember perfectly.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.000
We were in a semicircle
and there was your neck.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.000
She was extremely beautiful.

12:13.079 --> 12:16.280
I mean, she had her neck elongated,
in position.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.680
I was like, "This little squirt is
only four or five years old,

12:21.760 --> 12:25.280
and already she looks like
some sort of prima ballerina…"

12:26.199 --> 12:30.240
You instilled us with discipline,
sacrifice, hard work,

12:30.320 --> 12:32.240
dedication, team spirit…

12:32.880 --> 12:36.040
We were a family.
For me, it wasn't only dancing.

12:36.120 --> 12:39.599
To me, it was a second home.
It was my family, my motivation.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.120
- Well, you spent a lot of hours here.
- Many hours.

12:42.199 --> 12:45.160
Many hours, because
even when you didn't have class,

12:45.240 --> 12:47.880
I mean, you'd stay behind
and adapt to whatever was going on.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.280
- Help with the little ones.
- Yes.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.599
And I remember a conversation we had,
you were 14 or 15, and I said,

12:53.680 --> 12:55.719
"So, Georgina, do you want to dance?"

12:55.800 --> 12:58.640
And you said,
"I'm torn between dancing and modeling."

12:58.719 --> 13:00.199
When you're little, you think,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.520
"Well, I'll move to Madrid."
"I'll be a model and make a living."

13:04.120 --> 13:05.880
And life isn't like that.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.959
- Oh, your life has changed a lot.
- A lot.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.560
I'm so glad.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.040
I see that
she's making her dreams come true.

13:14.640 --> 13:19.000
I knew that my fu…
My destiny would be great

13:19.680 --> 13:23.079
I knew that…
I was going to have a bright future,

13:23.160 --> 13:26.400
and I always had the feeling
I'd raise a family-- The one I have.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.400
I knew I was going to be a young mom.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.040
I see she's confident.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.520
She seems fulfilled.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.800
That she's lived the life
she wanted to live.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.000
And she looks self-assured.

13:42.079 --> 13:43.360
We'll see who's coming.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.560
Ms. Sara!

13:49.240 --> 13:51.839
- Sara Lores.
- You look more a ballerina than I.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.560
It's so good to see her here
with her ballet gear,

13:55.640 --> 13:58.800
because it made me remember
when she was always in her living room

13:58.880 --> 14:00.199
moving her legs, stretching.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.240
We spent so much time here.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.880
You're still dancing, aren't you?

14:10.959 --> 14:12.880
- Yes, of course.
- You're so lucky.

14:12.959 --> 14:16.160
I'm a dancer.
I work for the National Dance Company.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.440
Em…

14:17.520 --> 14:21.599
I haven't done much else in my life
other than dance.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.800
- Are we gonna dance or what?
- Of course.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.360
- Whatever you want.
- Okay.

14:25.439 --> 14:28.439
But let's warm up a little bit.
I'm more stiff than a…

14:30.520 --> 14:33.240
Do you remember one day
at the supermarket?

14:33.319 --> 14:36.199
I kept saying, "My hair looks terrible."
You were so fed up.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.800
You touched the shoulder of the gentleman
in front of us and said,

14:38.880 --> 14:41.640
"Excuse me, sir,
do you think my friend's hair looks bad?"

14:41.719 --> 14:44.560
And then the gentleman says,
"God, no. I'd never think…"

14:44.640 --> 14:47.920
And then you told me, "There you go."
"You see?" "Stop bothering me."

14:48.719 --> 14:52.280
Georgina, when she was little,
was a little bit like she is today.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.959
Mischievous, fun…

14:54.959 --> 14:59.839
She was also caring,
super lively and very sharp.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.360
You used to dance all the time.
Here, at your home.

15:03.439 --> 15:06.040
All day you were dancing
in your living room.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.199
Do you remember?

15:07.280 --> 15:09.680
There was a time
when I was really obsessed with ballet.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.040
I never felt I was good enough
to be a ballerina.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.680
Otherwise, of course,
I would have kept dancing.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.920
Or at least I would have tried, you know?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.479
She's smart, hardworking,
and very stubborn,

15:19.560 --> 15:21.560
which is also very important.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.880
Plus, financially, it was very expensive,
you know?

15:24.959 --> 15:27.640
Then you start growing up,
and you have to buy point shoes,

15:27.719 --> 15:29.680
some other things, a competition…

15:29.760 --> 15:31.520
And we couldn't afford it.

15:31.599 --> 15:33.800
To do things half way, I said…

15:34.560 --> 15:35.560
"That's it."

15:36.520 --> 15:39.160
Dance is discipline, sacrifice,

15:39.240 --> 15:41.760
effort, friendship, camaraderie.

15:48.599 --> 15:49.800
I have to admit

15:49.880 --> 15:52.760
I've experienced scarcity
of a lot of things.

15:52.839 --> 15:55.000
At times, I've felt very lonely.

15:57.079 --> 15:59.800
And all of that has shaped me.

16:00.560 --> 16:05.120
And I am who I am today
thanks to dance and my childhood.

16:08.439 --> 16:09.520
Her body remembers.

16:09.599 --> 16:11.359
She has it inside.

16:11.439 --> 16:14.199
She has inside everything she's learned
since she was little.

16:16.319 --> 16:20.520
And she's reverting back to the expression
she had as… a child.

16:21.319 --> 16:25.520
When she was a little girl
dancing with so much joy and focus.

16:50.599 --> 16:52.640
- Hello.

16:52.719 --> 16:53.719
How are you?

16:55.640 --> 16:56.640
It's been so long.

16:56.719 --> 16:58.040
My second mom.

16:58.120 --> 17:01.000
Like Gio says, I'm like a second mother,

17:01.079 --> 17:02.959
because she spent a lot of time
at my home,

17:03.040 --> 17:05.079
and we had many wonderful moments.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.680
- How are you?
- Well. As usual.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.919
- I've brought you a keepsake.
- Did you?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.560
- Look.
- Wow…

17:13.399 --> 17:14.800
- Hmm?

17:14.880 --> 17:15.960
They're so pretty.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.440
- Look, you were so small.
- Wow.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.280
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

17:20.359 --> 17:23.440
- Those beach vacations?
- Yes, such good memories.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.359
Well…

17:24.440 --> 17:26.720
- Did you see how young you were there?
- Yes.

17:27.760 --> 17:31.080
I came back to Jaca
and it's like nothing's changed.

17:31.159 --> 17:33.320
It's a very strange feeling.

17:33.399 --> 17:35.159
I was sitting down at the citadel,

17:35.240 --> 17:38.600
and it's like the life I've had
after I left never happened.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.680
GRAUS, SPAIN

17:54.560 --> 17:57.560
When I turned 18,
I wanted to move to Madrid.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.520
I couldn't afford it,

17:59.600 --> 18:03.080
but I wasn't going to stay at home
feeling sorry for myself…

18:03.159 --> 18:08.000
and I got a job interview in a town
located two hours away from Jaca.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.680
I arrived in a town with 200 inhabitants.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.600
There was a straight road to the hotel

18:14.680 --> 18:16.560
where the job interview
was waiting for me.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.800
HOTEL LLEIDA - RESTAURANT

18:21.520 --> 18:23.120
I used to live there.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.240
- The side walk on the left? I remember.
- Yes.

18:27.159 --> 18:29.760
All the trucks would pass by,
people going to work.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.360
I was by myself.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.880
Mother of God, you've been so brave,
since you were little.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.800
At night, I was really scared
of going home alone

18:37.880 --> 18:40.080
because nobody was expecting me.

18:40.159 --> 18:42.560
No one would know
if I got home safe or not.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.760
So, every night,
I'd call my mom or my sister.

18:45.840 --> 18:49.000
If they didn't wake up,
I'd keep calling until they picked up.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.440
They'd keep me company.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.000
- The bar looks the same.
- It's closed?

18:53.080 --> 18:54.560
- Oh!
- It is.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.560
- It looks the same.
- Oh, it's a shame.

18:58.640 --> 18:59.480
Hello!

19:00.120 --> 19:02.120
The lady hasn't changed that much.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.520
- Mrs. Consuelo.
- Georgina.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.200
I didn't expect you here.

19:06.280 --> 19:09.480
Hey, they told me you were in Graus
and I just wanted to say hello.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.600
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Look at you! You look stunning.

19:12.679 --> 19:15.200
If you want to come in,
I have the keys to the hotel.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.919
- It's closed because of COVID.
- Oh!

19:17.000 --> 19:19.080
I'm sorry. We open on Thursday.

19:19.159 --> 19:21.240
- Great.
- You look gorgeous.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.679
Well, let's go in.
You both look really gorgeous.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.360
- Yes.
- You truly are.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.480
- Well, you were like family to us.
- I know.

19:32.320 --> 19:35.200
You taught me so much.
I learned a lot from you.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.640
But that wasn't necessary.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.600
- You are very smart and intelligent.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.000
- You were a quick learner.
- It's because I wanted to work.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.760
You didn't miss anything but…

19:43.840 --> 19:47.720
When I traveled to Madrid,
I went to the Gucci store to say hi.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.520
We did it because we had
such fond memories of her,

19:50.600 --> 19:52.080
that we didn't want to let go.

19:52.159 --> 19:53.679
You were everywhere.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.960
How did you manage to arrive before me?

19:56.040 --> 19:57.640
I remember I'd be doing something

19:57.720 --> 19:59.840
and I'd see you far away
dealing with someone.

19:59.919 --> 20:01.960
I'd turn around
and suddenly you were there,

20:02.040 --> 20:05.200
and I said to myself,
"How does she do it?"

20:05.280 --> 20:07.520
I remember being here
for the truffle season.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.600
There were a lot of people staying here.

20:09.679 --> 20:11.280
- A lot.
- Also the hunters…

20:11.360 --> 20:14.080
- The skiers.
- People going to Baqueira Beret.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.960
In fact, a lady who went skiing
with her husband saw me working here,

20:20.040 --> 20:23.159
and that was when
I decided to move to Madrid.

20:23.919 --> 20:26.280
Because the lady saw
I was such a good worker.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.880
- She told me…
- Of course.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.480
"Come to Madrid with me."

20:30.080 --> 20:30.960
I'm not surprised.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.560
- Not surprised at all.
- And it was.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.720
Because you're worth your weight in gold.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.159
I didn't think twice.
I got on a bus…

20:38.240 --> 20:39.440
Well…

20:40.360 --> 20:42.360
Eight buses to get to Madrid.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.919
I got lost at the
America Avenue bus terminal.

20:46.520 --> 20:50.200
I'd exit, come back, get in, cry out.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.679
I'd ask people, "Is this the right way?"

20:52.760 --> 20:55.840
"Yes, yes, girl,
keep going straight and you'll get there."

20:55.919 --> 20:59.760
So, I left my résumé at the Castellana,
in Inditex.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.440
I came back to America Avenue.
I slept on the bus.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.560
I got back on Sunday
at nine in the morning.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.800
I went home, showered…
My shift started at noon.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.800
I was really happy.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.600
I called my sister.
"I have a good feeling about this."

21:17.679 --> 21:19.320
"I know they'll call me."

21:20.120 --> 21:24.120
Do you know what I learned from you?
Doing things right the first time.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.080
If you do it right the first time,
you don't have to do it again,

21:27.159 --> 21:28.960
and the work is simpler and faster.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.080
- To be honest, that's--
- Either do things right or don't do it.

21:32.159 --> 21:34.720
When you do things halfway,
it takes you longer to finish.

21:36.360 --> 21:40.120
Cristiano Ronaldo is very lucky.
I'll say it again.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.560
Very lucky to have caught Georgina's eye.

21:43.640 --> 21:47.320
It was so good to see you,
to open the doors of the hotel for you,

21:47.399 --> 21:49.040
even though it is closed today.

21:49.679 --> 21:50.800
Well, it was such a pleasure.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.919
RESTAURANT

21:57.960 --> 21:59.600
- Hello!
Bye.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.679
I would walk alone here every night
at two in the morning,

22:05.760 --> 22:08.040
or at 5:30 a.m. when the hotel opened.

22:09.439 --> 22:10.880
And the trucks would pass.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.760
Look, there's the butcher shop.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.480
- Where I'd buy the pork sausages.
- Where they sold the pork sausages!

22:16.560 --> 22:18.800
- They were so good.
- Yes, that's my favorite butcher shop.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.760
Good morning.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.399
How beautiful she is.

22:23.480 --> 22:24.360
Thanks.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.240
I remember I'd come here
in the mornings and afternoons.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.600
You'd make me happy and keep me company.

22:30.679 --> 22:33.320
I'd spend an hour here watching
the old ladies shopping.

22:33.399 --> 22:36.000
- I didn't have any friends here so…
- Yes, right.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.439
I remember the <i>secallona.</i>
You gave me a course.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.800
- Yes…
- "This is<i> longaniza, </i>this is<i> secallona,</i>

22:40.880 --> 22:42.760
this is<i> fuet, </i>this is…"

22:43.320 --> 22:45.560
- We have samples.
- You can try them.

22:46.159 --> 22:48.159
- Give me the little plate.
- Wait a moment.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.040
- Yummy!
- You'll like it more.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.080
- The <i>secallona?</i>
- This is the <i>secallona.</i>

22:52.760 --> 22:53.919
- This one?
- Yes.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.840
This one has the white stuff.

22:55.919 --> 22:58.760
- We have one without mold.
- I like it better without the white stuff.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.640
Without the white.
Yes, I remember.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.720
I like it.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.439
- It's so good.
- My mouth is watering.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.600
You can even make sandwiches
for the kids.

23:06.679 --> 23:09.200
You don't know how much
they like the cold cuts.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.760
- Yeah, yeah.
- They are so Spanish.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.840
- To be honest…
- You always liked cold…

23:13.919 --> 23:16.880
Because of my dad.
My dad would buy me a lot of that.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.040
I have a very fast metabolism,

23:19.120 --> 23:21.880
and I hope, knock on wood,
it never changes.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.720
Because I love to eat
and I enjoy eating a lot.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.000
It's something that makes me bond
with people.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.480
- I want<i> secallona, </i>without mold.
-  <i>Secallona?</i> Without the mold.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.800
Okay, let's do this.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.600
This is for Italy and this is for Spain.

23:41.679 --> 23:43.560
- Yes, done.
- Two… Two more.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.760
- And Sofi. Four more here.
- Four more.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.640
ITALY - MADRID

23:57.159 --> 23:59.360
Could you please take a photo
with us?

23:59.439 --> 24:00.679
Yes, I'll take one.

24:03.840 --> 24:08.560
Right now, I try to always search for
quiet places where I can be comfortable.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.720
Without people crowding me,
so I avoid crowded places.

24:14.679 --> 24:15.919
Bye, sweetie.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.360
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yes, where?

24:18.439 --> 24:19.800
Maybe here on the helmet?

24:22.040 --> 24:24.880
I also understand the people
who want to get close,

24:24.960 --> 24:29.000
say hello to me, to meet me and tell me,
"Georgia, I love you."

24:29.080 --> 24:31.919
Or, "Please, Georgina,
take a picture with me."

24:38.159 --> 24:42.000
I understand, but sometimes
I'm not camera-ready,

24:42.080 --> 24:44.520
looking my best or feeling good.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.480
- <i>How are you, dear?</i>
- Look.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.760
I'm buying pork sausages in Graus.

24:53.840 --> 24:57.600
In the village where I used to work.
I went to see my Mrs. Consuelo, my boss.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.840
Now we're going to the church.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.800
- <i> Everybody's behind you.</i>
- What?

25:03.880 --> 25:06.960
- <i>Everybody's behind you.</i>
- I look like the president.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.159
The twins get shocked.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.679
They say, "Wow,
this only happens with the president."

25:12.399 --> 25:13.439
- <i> Of course.</i>

25:15.399 --> 25:16.480
I don't think I'm famous,

25:17.480 --> 25:19.080
but, I have to admit,

25:19.159 --> 25:22.520
when I go out, people make me feel
like I'm well known.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.600
- <i>Love you. See you soon.</i>
- Have you eaten?

25:27.399 --> 25:28.640
<i>I'm going to eat now.</i>

25:28.720 --> 25:30.399
Okay, are you eating at home?

25:31.520 --> 25:33.960
- <i>Here, look. By myself.</i>
- That sounds great.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.159
In your element.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.439
- <i>Of course. Look.</i>
- That's cool.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.760
- <i>Don't believe me?</i>
- What are you going to eat?

25:42.280 --> 25:43.399
<i>The chicken you like.</i>

25:43.480 --> 25:44.520
I'm jealous.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.520
Yummy.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.840
Cristiano is wonderful.

25:49.919 --> 25:51.800
He is a very normal man.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.399
He's more normal
than normal people.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.280
Incredible.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.040
<i> All right, dear…</i>

25:59.120 --> 26:02.360
- Well, kisses. See you later. Bye-bye.
- <i> Bye-bye.</i>

26:06.159 --> 26:07.199
LA PEÑA BASILICA

26:07.280 --> 26:08.679
- Hello.
- Hello.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.120
How are you?

26:10.199 --> 26:12.640
- Great, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

26:17.919 --> 26:20.000
I didn't have any friends in Graus,

26:20.080 --> 26:23.199
and of course, in the evenings
between five and eight,

26:23.280 --> 26:25.399
I would have felt very lonely.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.560
"So, what do you do in Graus?"
"Well, I'm going to the church."

26:36.880 --> 26:41.760
So I went to listen to the nuns
pray the Rosary, one Our Father,

26:41.840 --> 26:43.040
and then mass would start.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.880
On my free days, I'd go to the shrine,

26:45.960 --> 26:48.520
to the Basilica,
and bring flowers to the Virgin.

26:54.439 --> 26:57.800
The basilica has a strength… a power…

27:06.399 --> 27:08.080
I'm very religious.

27:17.880 --> 27:21.640
I've always felt God's protection.

27:32.040 --> 27:35.960
God has always enlightened me,
and given me strength to fight

27:36.040 --> 27:37.679
and know what's good for me.

27:46.439 --> 27:48.399
I would pray and ask God, "Help me."

27:55.240 --> 27:58.280
"Guide me, and bring me to my destiny."

28:02.240 --> 28:04.880
I went to Graus knowing that that year,

28:04.960 --> 28:06.480
after my sister finished high school,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.439
we'd go to Madrid together.

28:09.159 --> 28:10.640
And that's what happened.

28:13.560 --> 28:17.000
Thank God, they called me
four days after I dropped off my résumé.

28:21.880 --> 28:26.760
She finished her SAT's.
I arrived in Madrid one month before her.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.679
MADRID, SPAIN

28:34.320 --> 28:38.199
My arrival in Madrid was… terrible.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.520
I was looking for a cheap apartment.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.199
Three hundred euros.

28:48.879 --> 28:51.480
I ended up in an apartment
on America Avenue

28:51.560 --> 28:53.760
that I later found out
had been a storage unit.

28:54.959 --> 28:58.679
It was really cold in the winter
and superhot in the summer.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.399
I had a neighbor, Mrs. Carmen.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.120
I worked during the day at Massimo Dutti.

29:12.679 --> 29:15.080
It took five hours
of public transportation

29:15.159 --> 29:16.800
because it was really far.

29:18.720 --> 29:24.360
Occasionally, on Fridays and Saturdays,
I'd serve drinks at a small pub.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.840
I remember coming home
one Sunday evening after work.

29:30.480 --> 29:35.679
I had to work Thursday day,
Thursday night, Friday day, Friday night,

29:35.760 --> 29:38.199
Saturday day, Saturday night,

29:38.280 --> 29:40.399
and all day Sunday at Massimo Dutti.

29:41.199 --> 29:43.639
I came home crying, really dizzy.

29:43.720 --> 29:48.120
So, I knocked on her door and said,
"Please, Carmen, I'm your neighbor."

29:48.199 --> 29:50.600
"Could you fix me
some rice with a fried egg?"

29:51.240 --> 29:53.199
And she said, "Of course, dear."

29:53.760 --> 29:56.800
Well, from that moment on,
she was super important to me.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.679
She was amazing.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.040
When you are a good person,

30:01.120 --> 30:03.320
life puts good people in your path.

30:04.439 --> 30:07.000
That's why I never forget
where I came from,

30:07.080 --> 30:09.240
and I try to help others whenever I can.

30:10.399 --> 30:15.000
MADRID, SPAIN
FAMILY HOME

30:21.000 --> 30:23.560
- Good morning.
- <i>How are you?</i> <i>How's everything?</i>

30:23.639 --> 30:25.840
Great, I'm wrapping the gifts
for the kids.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.600
<i>Well, they're really excited.</i>
<i>We told them yesterday.</i>

30:29.679 --> 30:31.959
- Oh, did you tell them I'm coming?
- <i>Yes.</i>

30:32.040 --> 30:34.639
- What did they say?
- <i>They're excited. So excited.</i>

30:34.720 --> 30:36.760
I'm going to Nuevo Futuro.

30:36.840 --> 30:40.720
It's a children's foundation for kids
that come from broken homes.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.240
They're under the guardianship
of Madrid's government.

30:43.959 --> 30:46.159
- My godchildren.
<i>Let me know if you need help…</i>

30:46.240 --> 30:47.840
Okay, no need. I'm on it.

30:47.919 --> 30:50.080
<i>Great. Awesome,</i>
<i>Georgina, thanks.</i>

30:50.159 --> 30:51.399
- Kisses.
- <i> Bye-bye.</i>

31:01.760 --> 31:04.959
Love, I'm arriving
at the little Nuevo Futuro apartment.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.679
Be ready in, I think,
between 20 minutes and half an hour.

31:10.399 --> 31:12.480
We'll surprise them with your call, okay?

31:13.080 --> 31:15.639
The team told me
the kids are really excited.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.000
Okay. Kisses. Talk to you soon.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.959
Every time I come, they ask me,
"When is Cristiano coming?"

31:21.040 --> 31:23.959
All the kids have
a lot of Cristiano posters.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.240
They want to be like him.
They want to play soccer.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.439
They love Cris's cleats, they love him.

31:28.520 --> 31:29.840
And they always ask,

31:29.919 --> 31:31.959
"Well, when is Cristiano coming?"

31:32.040 --> 31:34.399
and I always tell them,
"He'll come next time."

31:34.480 --> 31:36.439
I was starting to feel bad but I thought,

31:36.520 --> 31:38.199
"Well, nowadays with technology,

31:38.280 --> 31:41.159
there's no better way to have him near
than with a video call."

31:42.800 --> 31:44.840
- Hi!
- Hi.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.159
How are you? Wow, you're so big!

31:49.840 --> 31:51.679
How old was she the first time I was here?

31:51.760 --> 31:53.560
Three. Right, Angie?

31:53.639 --> 31:54.719
- Three?
- Yes.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.120
- Now you are six or seven?
- Six.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.360
- She will be seven.
- You are so big!

32:01.199 --> 32:02.879
Did you play with the Christmas toys?

32:02.959 --> 32:04.959
- Yes.
- And the perfumes?

32:05.040 --> 32:05.879
As well.

32:05.959 --> 32:07.159
-  A lot.
- As well?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.800
- Look!
- Let's see the gorgeous siblings.

32:10.480 --> 32:12.120
- It's… Cristiano.
- Wow.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.879
- Yes.
- And Messi. Look.

32:15.719 --> 32:17.360
- Look at what I did.
- It's so pretty.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.919
- Did you do it yourself?
- Yes!

32:20.000 --> 32:21.879
- Really?
- Look, this is my mom.

32:21.959 --> 32:22.919
Wow!

32:24.040 --> 32:25.199
She's so pretty.

32:25.919 --> 32:28.679
One day, I got curious
about the apartments.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.520
What are these apartments?

32:30.600 --> 32:33.919
What is it like in an apartment
full of kids under the guardianship

32:34.000 --> 32:36.959
of the community and taken care of
by the association?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.800
They threw themselves into my arms.

32:38.879 --> 32:40.199
They showed me their rooms,

32:40.280 --> 32:42.760
and then they told me
about their backgrounds.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.600
- Let me see. Is it a real diamond?
- Hmm? No.

32:46.679 --> 32:48.760
Next time, I'll bring you
the heart-shaped ones

32:48.840 --> 32:51.360
with the necklaces
that come with the princess shoes.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.360
I buy a lot of them for my girls.

32:54.439 --> 32:56.040
- Aw…
- Okay?

32:56.120 --> 32:57.320
Do you have daughters?

32:57.399 --> 33:00.639
- Yes, I have two girls and two boys.
- What are their names?

33:01.159 --> 33:02.719
Alana is the youngest.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.639
Eva, the older girl.

33:05.199 --> 33:08.080
Mateo, in the middle
and Cris is the eldest.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.320
- Cris?
- Cristiano…

33:11.040 --> 33:12.080
like his dad.

33:13.320 --> 33:16.040
This is the older girls' room.
Martina, Míriam…

33:16.600 --> 33:19.600
- Then you're not here anymore? Oh?
- No.

33:19.679 --> 33:21.520
Did you move
to the older girls' apartment?

33:21.600 --> 33:24.439
Oh, great. This is close
to Las Ventas, no?

33:24.520 --> 33:26.120
- Yes.
- I lived on the other side.

33:26.199 --> 33:27.800
Near La Guindalera.

33:27.879 --> 33:30.639
- I'd walk when I could.
- What did you do for work?

33:31.439 --> 33:33.320
I worked at a clothing store.

33:33.399 --> 33:35.000
- Which one?
- Gucci.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.040
Is it…

33:36.120 --> 33:39.919
It's not enough to buy
and give them presents, to donate money…

33:40.520 --> 33:44.280
No… You have to go, spend time with them,

33:45.159 --> 33:47.760
so they feel supported, cared for.

33:49.159 --> 33:51.679
- Where are the other kids?
- Nearby. There!

33:51.760 --> 33:54.080
- I think so. I don't know.
- Come here, guys.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.040
Let's see. Each one has a name.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.719
This one is for Britany.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.000
She gave me Nikes!

34:06.600 --> 34:07.560
From the house.

34:07.639 --> 34:08.920
- Really?
- Yes, yes.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.560
Read this first. This one, this one.

34:11.639 --> 34:12.799
- This one.
- This one?

34:12.880 --> 34:13.839
Oh, this one!

34:14.719 --> 34:16.080
Okay, let's see this one.

34:16.760 --> 34:20.280
"Georgina, you are a person
with a big heart."

34:20.880 --> 34:21.960
Oh…

34:36.440 --> 34:37.839
Here, you read it.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.280
You read it to me.

34:44.360 --> 34:47.239
"Georgina, you're a person
with such a big heart."

34:47.319 --> 34:49.520
"I wish there were more people like you."

34:49.600 --> 34:52.520
"You're honest, kind,
and a wonderful mother."

34:52.600 --> 34:54.440
"I hope you never forget me."

34:55.719 --> 34:56.880
I'll never forget you.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.040
Let's see…

35:04.480 --> 35:06.760
Every time I see them, I get emotional.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.839
I also get emotional
every time I think of them.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.280
It's… They're wonderful children.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.640
And very grateful.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.280
It's amazing to me.
It takes so little to make them happy.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.240
They are… I mean, they say things
that an adult or someone more aware

35:23.319 --> 35:26.600
or better-off… would never tell you.

35:27.120 --> 35:27.960
You know?

35:28.720 --> 35:30.160
Okay, Kevin, read me yours.

35:31.080 --> 35:34.040
"I love you lots, Georgina." "Kevin."

35:34.120 --> 35:36.319
"I love you, Georgina and…

35:36.400 --> 35:38.680
I love Cristiano Ronaldo."

35:38.760 --> 35:41.280
- "I love you lots, Georgina."

35:41.360 --> 35:43.839
- Georgina.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.280
"And thank you for the shoes, Georgina."

35:47.360 --> 35:50.000
"And look, I love you a lot."

35:50.080 --> 35:52.720
"I've never told you this, Georgina."

35:52.799 --> 35:54.720
"I love you so much."

35:54.799 --> 35:56.600
- Oh!

35:56.680 --> 35:59.080
- You did great!
- You should have told me.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.839
Every time I see you, you should tell me.

36:06.120 --> 36:10.000
Well, I have another surprise
for you guys, prepared with a lot of love.

36:10.880 --> 36:11.839
Hello!

36:12.400 --> 36:13.400
<i>- Hi!</i>
- Hello!

36:13.480 --> 36:15.040
Look, it's Cristiano! Look at him.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.319
- Scoot over, cause I can't see!
- Hello!

36:17.400 --> 36:19.200
Kevin, Kevin. This one!

36:19.799 --> 36:22.200
- <i>All good?</i>
- Yes, all good. Very happy.

36:24.160 --> 36:27.920
<i>Great, guys. I just called to say hi,</i>
<i>send you a hug,</i>

36:28.000 --> 36:32.640
<i>and one day, I'll come along with Gio</i>
<i>to visit you. I'd love that.</i>

36:34.000 --> 36:35.760
Great!

36:40.720 --> 36:44.600
<i>So, keep studying. Study a lot</i>
<i>and do things the right way, okay?</i>

36:44.680 --> 36:47.560
- Okay.
- Today? Are you coming today?

36:47.640 --> 36:49.880
<i>A kiss to everyone</i>
<i>and see you soon, okay?</i>

36:50.400 --> 36:51.480
Thank you.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.560
- Thank you.
<i>- Kisses. See you later.</i>

36:54.240 --> 36:56.680
Bye. Kisses.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.040
<i>- Honey, I'll call you later.</i>
- Okay. Ciao.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.120
Aw!

37:03.480 --> 37:05.040
They were really excited.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.319
It surprised me when Cristiano told me,

37:07.400 --> 37:09.440
"Well, honey,
I'll call you later, kisses."

37:09.520 --> 37:12.040
Everyone was like, "Aw."

37:12.120 --> 37:14.920
- Did you like the surprise?
- My goodness, a great surprise.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.560
You weren't expecting this, huh?

37:17.480 --> 37:19.120
Were you expecting this?

37:19.200 --> 37:21.000
- Cristiano Ronaldo!
- Kevin!

37:21.080 --> 37:22.680
Kevin will die of happiness.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.799
Well, he is
his favorite soccer player.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.520
- Of course. Is he your favorite player?
- Yes!

37:28.600 --> 37:30.200
Okay. Well, a kiss for everyone.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.400
- I have to go.
- Thanks very much, Georgina.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.680
It's very important for me
to remember where I come from,

37:35.760 --> 37:36.680
who I am.

37:36.760 --> 37:40.280
At the end, your experiences make you
who you are.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.040
And thanks to my "popularity"
and platform,

37:44.560 --> 37:47.760
I can help many associations,
and many people in need.

37:48.319 --> 37:49.280
Yes.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.600
I love you so much. You are adorable.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.000
- Next time, you bring Cristiano.
- Okay, I'll bring him.

37:59.280 --> 38:02.280
MARBELLA, SPAIN

38:05.520 --> 38:06.839
A picture! Over here.

38:07.839 --> 38:09.040
How are you?

38:09.640 --> 38:11.080
- Yes? Thanks.
- Yes, yes.

38:12.720 --> 38:17.080
Accept an award, get up on stage,
talk in front of so many people?

38:17.160 --> 38:18.359
I'm a little nervous.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.480
Dear, I get weak in the knees.

38:20.560 --> 38:24.319
<i>The 2021 Starlite award</i>
<i>goes to Georgina Rodríguez.</i>

38:24.400 --> 38:27.880
Thank you very much. It's an honor
to receive a solidarity award.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.240
I'll keep helping whenever I can.

38:30.319 --> 38:32.240
Do what's right, come what may.

38:35.120 --> 38:38.560
<i>If it were me</i>
<i>I'd do the impossible to have you</i>

38:42.200 --> 38:46.319
In soccer, things change in a second,
and you have to be ready for everything.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.760
Our time in Turin has been amazing.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.680
It's a city that has taught me so much.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.760
An unforgettable experience.
