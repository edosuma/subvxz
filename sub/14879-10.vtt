WEBVTT

00:01.955 --> 00:03.189
This time
instead of the bob,

00:03.223 --> 00:04.490
you need to break
with your right--

00:04.524 --> 00:06.158
- Okay.
- Give me the left elbow.

00:06.193 --> 00:07.908
Good, one more.
Same thing.

00:07.942 --> 00:09.338
Right--with your right.
Good.

00:09.373 --> 00:11.008
Now break it and then
the left elbow.

00:12.073 --> 00:13.472
Very nice, Miss Walker.

00:13.506 --> 00:14.608
Good.
One more time.

00:14.642 --> 00:16.540
Where'd you go?
I'm right here.

00:16.575 --> 00:17.875
All right.
Try again.

00:17.909 --> 00:20.049
Go.
And bob underneath.

00:20.084 --> 00:23.157
But you got to bob, or you're
gonna end up like this.

00:23.192 --> 00:24.396
Okay?

00:24.431 --> 00:26.168
Go.
Break with the right.

00:26.203 --> 00:27.570
And then--
ooh! Ooh!

00:27.604 --> 00:29.244
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

00:29.278 --> 00:31.219
Ow.
Your other left.

00:32.921 --> 00:34.691
When you're learning
hand-to-hand combat,

00:34.725 --> 00:37.831
it's best not
to be distracted.

00:37.866 --> 00:39.369
It's just this weekend,

00:39.403 --> 00:43.273
I blocked off two days to
definitely read in my sister,

00:43.308 --> 00:45.041
you know, if I can,

00:45.076 --> 00:48.512
assuming the time is right
and I don't push it...Again.

00:48.547 --> 00:51.382
Well, as long
as you're sure.

00:51.416 --> 00:54.718
Look, there's no manual
for this kind of thing.

00:54.752 --> 00:56.186
Just be honest.

00:56.221 --> 00:58.087
Be honest about
having been dishonest?

00:58.122 --> 01:01.192
Exactly, and if all else
fails, you go to plan "B."

01:01.226 --> 01:03.730
Check my bag.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.770
Oh!

01:07.805 --> 01:10.074
Contraband.

01:10.108 --> 01:12.011
Is this for me or Danielle?

01:12.046 --> 01:13.381
Ideally both.

01:13.415 --> 01:17.887
Just don't drink it
before the staff meeting, huh?

01:17.921 --> 01:20.358
After careful analysis
and assessment,

01:20.392 --> 01:22.094
we've decided to proceed
with the defection

01:22.128 --> 01:23.729
of one Shen Yue.

01:23.763 --> 01:25.531
Scientist and
Chinese National,

01:25.566 --> 01:28.201
Shen will be in D.C. this week
for a tech conference.

01:28.236 --> 01:29.871
This is Operation Steelhead.

01:29.905 --> 01:32.242
Shen is a top
hydroelectric engineer

01:32.276 --> 01:34.311
who worked on
the Three Gorges Dam.

01:34.345 --> 01:37.015
He's a big get who
can provide us with intel

01:37.050 --> 01:38.083
on China's energy.

01:38.118 --> 01:39.252
It's all in his case file,

01:39.286 --> 01:41.421
which is required reading
for everyone--

01:41.455 --> 01:43.958
everyone, that is,
except for Annie.

01:43.993 --> 01:46.762
That's because Annie
wrote the file.

01:46.796 --> 01:48.498
And as such,
Annie will facilitate

01:48.532 --> 01:49.766
the defection of Shen.

01:49.801 --> 01:52.136
Shen will be her asset.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.805
We're targeting
next Friday's conference

01:53.839 --> 01:58.076
closing ceremonies
for the extraction.

01:58.110 --> 02:01.813
Joan.

02:01.847 --> 02:04.449
I expected I would be
the lead on this operation.

02:04.483 --> 02:05.717
Seniority
isn't the only metric

02:05.751 --> 02:07.018
we make decisions on.

02:07.053 --> 02:08.520
I managed half
the vetting process

02:08.554 --> 02:10.555
and ran point
with Beijing Station.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.358
And Annie set up a dummy
engineering chat site

02:13.392 --> 02:15.460
and cultivated
and turned an asset

02:15.494 --> 02:17.595
via the Internet
in three months.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.330
She's qualified and ready.

02:19.365 --> 02:22.468
I like Annie,
but this is bad management.

02:22.502 --> 02:25.005
Duly noted.

02:32.615 --> 02:33.849
Oh, hey.

02:33.884 --> 02:35.518
Whole Foods took forever.

02:35.552 --> 02:36.552
Pita chip?

02:36.587 --> 02:39.857
I'm good.

02:39.891 --> 02:41.792
Danielle, I--
I need to preface this

02:41.826 --> 02:43.861
by saying that I love you
very much.

02:43.895 --> 02:46.763
And this might be difficult,

02:46.798 --> 02:50.968
but I've thought about it
a lot...

02:51.003 --> 02:52.570
And I think now is the time.

02:52.604 --> 02:55.439
What is it?

02:59.978 --> 03:01.679
That's it--

03:01.713 --> 03:05.484
just that I love you
and, uh...

03:05.518 --> 03:07.320
I love living here with you
and the girls.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.522
That's what you were
gonna say?

03:09.556 --> 03:11.892
Mm-hmm.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.372 --> 03:24.540
I guess it's just you and me.

03:27.978 --> 03:28.978
Hey.

03:29.012 --> 03:30.780
Hey!
Did you read your sister in?

03:30.814 --> 03:32.114
Ugh.

03:32.149 --> 03:34.850
Call me a rooster,
'cause I'm a big chicken.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.686
Bummer.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.122
Well, Operation Steelhead's
been moved up to this evening.

03:39.156 --> 03:40.456
There's chatter out
of Beijing.

03:40.491 --> 03:42.525
Ops van's already in position
outside the hotel.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.195
Um, uh, uh, give me an hour
to get dressed.

03:45.230 --> 03:46.730
Great.
You got 15 minutes.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.104
Keep calm.

03:54.139 --> 03:56.440
That'll help Shen stay calm.

03:56.474 --> 03:58.909
In 20 minutes, you'll have
a story to tell your grandkids,

03:58.944 --> 04:03.181
assuming you eventually get
around to reading them in.

04:37.515 --> 04:38.948
We can speak English.

04:38.983 --> 04:40.817
Oh, thank goodness.

04:40.851 --> 04:42.252
Chinese
is a beautiful language,

04:42.286 --> 04:44.254
but sometimes I feel
like I'm not doing it justice.

04:44.289 --> 04:45.923
There are times even
when I don't feel

04:45.957 --> 04:48.159
I'm doing it justice.

04:51.631 --> 04:53.231
It's so nice
to finally meet you

04:53.266 --> 04:57.002
after three months of being
encrypted email pen pals.

04:57.036 --> 04:58.270
I feel like I know
you already.

04:58.304 --> 04:59.705
Same for me,

04:59.739 --> 05:01.807
although you're much prettier
than you let on.

05:01.841 --> 05:04.209
Flattery
will get you everywhere.

05:04.243 --> 05:06.478
Well, hopefully to America.

05:06.512 --> 05:09.280
Science knows
no boundaries

05:09.314 --> 05:11.982
and sees no countries
or colors.

05:12.016 --> 05:14.384
It is through science

05:14.418 --> 05:16.986
that we bridge the gaps
of cultures...

05:18.288 --> 05:19.888
And reach toward a higher
level of discourse.

05:38.308 --> 05:40.375
Soup's over, Annie.

05:40.410 --> 05:43.178
It's time for the main course.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.013
It's time.

05:51.153 --> 05:52.987
Mr. Shen needs to use
the facilities.

05:53.021 --> 05:55.455
I'll freshen up myself.
Please excuse us.

06:01.897 --> 06:04.899
The salmon
is swimming upstream.

06:14.244 --> 06:17.247
Salmon is jumping the dam.

06:47.745 --> 06:49.746
Stay close.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.401
Okay.

08:02.954 --> 08:04.088
Salmon is home.

08:04.122 --> 08:08.592
Not bad for a day's work.

08:08.627 --> 08:11.028
Mr. Shen,
let me officially welcome you

08:11.062 --> 08:12.796
to America.

08:12.831 --> 08:14.331
Thank you.

08:14.365 --> 08:16.700
What would you like to do now
that you've defected?

08:16.734 --> 08:19.269
Is it too late to catch
the Nationals?

08:19.303 --> 08:20.971
I do love baseball.

08:21.005 --> 08:22.473
That's very American of you.

08:22.507 --> 08:24.441
Let's get you to the safe house
for debriefing,

08:24.476 --> 08:26.344
and then we'll see if maybe
we can't catch ball game.

08:26.378 --> 08:27.979
Okay.

08:42.496 --> 08:44.264
"Went to the movies
with K. and C.

08:44.298 --> 08:46.399
"Also, Dr. Scott called
to confirm your date.

08:46.434 --> 08:47.634
Yeah!"

08:54.809 --> 08:56.176
Annie Walker.

08:56.210 --> 08:58.445
Protocol directive 42-30.

08:58.479 --> 08:59.912
Password?

08:59.947 --> 09:01.414
Clover.

09:01.448 --> 09:03.316
Operative Walker,
asset Shen Yue

09:03.350 --> 09:05.552
has been checked
into Georgetown Hospital.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.622
We believe
he may have been poisoned.

09:08.657 --> 09:10.024
Poisoned?

09:10.058 --> 09:13.861
He says it's from the soup.

09:13.895 --> 09:15.829
I had the soup, too.

09:15.864 --> 09:18.332
Report to Georgetown Hospital
immediately.

09:18.366 --> 09:21.402
You may be in danger.

10:13.707 --> 10:15.107
How are you feeling?

10:15.142 --> 10:16.976
Not great.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.543
I've eaten Chinese food
for 40 years,

10:18.578 --> 10:20.545
never had a problem.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.948
It's too coincidental
to be food poisoning.

10:22.982 --> 10:24.917
Did you tell anyone
about your plan?

10:24.951 --> 10:27.919
No, I've been careful
about my intentions.

10:27.954 --> 10:30.188
I need to talk to my friend
Xi Peng

10:30.223 --> 10:32.925
at the Asian Cultural
Organization.

10:32.959 --> 10:35.094
He was at the conference.

10:35.128 --> 10:39.332
So the blood work came back
inconclusive for both of you.

10:39.367 --> 10:40.767
I'm not sure what's going on.

10:40.801 --> 10:44.004
I just want to do
one more test.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.714
What is that?

10:53.749 --> 10:54.982
This is a dosimeter.

10:55.017 --> 10:57.218
It measures exposure
to ionizing radiation.

10:57.253 --> 10:58.520
- Radiation?
- Yeah.

10:58.554 --> 11:00.188
Right now this entire wing
of the hospital

11:00.223 --> 11:02.724
will be emptied,
due to a false gas leak.

11:02.759 --> 11:05.460
Extreme discretion
and cautionary measures

11:05.494 --> 11:07.562
must be taken.

11:07.597 --> 11:10.598
Both of you will be treated
in our biohazard triage unit

11:10.633 --> 11:13.968
in the basement
of this hospital.

11:33.857 --> 11:35.658
Hi.

11:35.692 --> 11:37.927
I'll be treating you now.
I work with the Agency.

11:37.961 --> 11:42.531
Think of a radioactive isotope
like a habanero pepper.

11:42.566 --> 11:44.700
You can be around it.
It won't hurt you.

11:44.735 --> 11:46.936
If it gets on your skin,
it can irritate it.

11:46.971 --> 11:49.439
If you ingest it,
that's a whole different story.

11:49.473 --> 11:52.141
Your immune system could be
profoundly compromised.

11:52.176 --> 11:54.343
That's why you're in here--

11:54.377 --> 11:56.379
to protect you from us.

11:56.413 --> 11:58.781
I'm just checking
this battery right now,

11:58.816 --> 12:01.785
but if you hear this beep...

12:01.819 --> 12:04.755
You need to contact us
immediately.

12:10.862 --> 12:12.096
Shen okay?

12:12.130 --> 12:13.298
He's scared.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.067
We'll know more soon.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.835
What about the others
at our table?

12:16.869 --> 12:18.838
We liaised
with all the other hospitals

12:18.872 --> 12:20.306
and medical centers
in the area.

12:20.341 --> 12:21.741
No one else
from the conference

12:21.775 --> 12:23.709
has reported any symptoms.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.511
So Shen was the target.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.979
Or I was.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.780
We're also checking
the vehicle

12:28.815 --> 12:30.416
and the safe house
for radiation.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.618
Any other place
that you've been

12:32.652 --> 12:33.986
needs to be cleared as well,

12:34.020 --> 12:35.654
in case you were
the primary target.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.322
I went home
after the conference.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.491
You live with your sister?

12:39.525 --> 12:40.526
And her family.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.160
You need to call her
immediately.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.664
That property needs
to be swept.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.277
Hey. I thought you were going
out with Dr. Scott.

12:58.312 --> 13:00.646
Danielle, where are you
right now?

13:00.681 --> 13:02.215
Oh, we're getting ice cream
after the movie.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.617
Okay, good.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.085
Don't go home.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.820
What do you mean
"Don't go home"?

13:07.854 --> 13:09.221
Don't argue with me.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.789
You're scaring me.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.625
I'm trying to scare you.
Take the girls

13:12.659 --> 13:14.627
and go to Michael's
mother's house for the night.

13:14.662 --> 13:16.029
What is this about?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.730
You've been acting
really strange lately.

13:17.765 --> 13:19.799
I'll talk to you soon.
I'll explain everything.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.767
Please just don't go home.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.735
Fine.

13:30.676 --> 13:32.343
Steve Barr.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.478
When I get a visit

13:33.512 --> 13:35.713
from the State Department
after hours,

13:35.747 --> 13:37.080
I know it's not good.

13:37.115 --> 13:38.982
The Shen Yue situation--
uh...

13:39.017 --> 13:41.017
We need you to hold off
investigating.

13:41.052 --> 13:43.553
The CIA is not
an investigative organization.

13:43.587 --> 13:47.389
I'm sorry,
but State wants this to go away.

13:47.424 --> 13:49.825
This kind of thing
makes both parties look bad.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.360
Health scare
and a security breach?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.162
Nobody needs it.

13:53.196 --> 13:56.766
Least of all my operative
and her asset.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.801
CIA doesn't go near this,

13:58.835 --> 14:02.105
or I will bring
the hammer down.

14:02.139 --> 14:04.641
Glad to see those
anger management seminars

14:04.675 --> 14:07.010
are paying off.

14:07.045 --> 14:10.548
This is the last time
we'll talk about this.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.954
In all the corresponding
we did,

14:15.989 --> 14:18.691
I had no idea
you liked baseball.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.193
My brother was obsessed
with the game,

14:21.228 --> 14:24.597
even though he could access
only box scores

14:24.632 --> 14:26.733
from smuggled
western newspapers.

14:26.768 --> 14:29.970
Your brother who died
in Tiananmen Square?

14:30.004 --> 14:32.072
He was my younger brother.

14:32.106 --> 14:36.544
But Wei-Min taught me
and inspired me.

14:36.578 --> 14:38.579
So, when I watch baseball,

14:38.614 --> 14:40.815
he's with me.

14:40.850 --> 14:43.685
Do you have any siblings?

14:43.719 --> 14:46.321
A sister.

14:46.355 --> 14:49.291
I've been lying to her
for two years.

14:49.325 --> 14:51.927
To protect her
from your life?

14:51.961 --> 14:53.194
That was the goal.

14:53.229 --> 14:55.931
I couldn't.

14:55.965 --> 14:58.900
Now I have to tell her
everything.

14:58.934 --> 15:01.369
A secret is like a wall.

15:01.403 --> 15:03.271
It can protect,

15:03.306 --> 15:06.607
but it can isolate.

15:06.642 --> 15:09.878
So our tests came back.

15:09.912 --> 15:12.781
Annie, it appears that you were
not directly poisoned.

15:12.815 --> 15:15.383
What about Shen?

15:19.055 --> 15:20.789
Mr. Shen...

15:20.824 --> 15:23.993
You definitely ingested
a large dose

15:24.027 --> 15:26.029
of Polonium 210.

15:26.063 --> 15:29.032
Enough to be fatal.

15:29.066 --> 15:30.967
However, there is hope.

15:31.002 --> 15:34.538
Ever since the Litvinenko
poisonings in London in '06,

15:34.572 --> 15:37.275
the pharmaceutical companies
have been working on antidotes

15:37.309 --> 15:39.143
for exactly this kind
of situation.

15:39.178 --> 15:42.246
If I weren't
directly involved,

15:42.280 --> 15:44.748
I would find that depressing.

15:44.782 --> 15:46.316
There is an injection

15:46.351 --> 15:50.386
that the Air Force
radiobiology lab has developed.

15:50.421 --> 15:53.255
It has a 20% chance
of success.

15:53.290 --> 15:54.857
Give it to me.

15:54.891 --> 15:57.593
If it doesn't work,
it may hasten your demise.

15:57.627 --> 16:00.795
So, if there's anyone
that you want to call

16:00.829 --> 16:01.796
to say good-bye to--

16:01.830 --> 16:04.098
No, I have left my home
already.

16:04.133 --> 16:05.833
Let me sign the consent forms.

16:05.868 --> 16:08.069
There are no forms.

16:20.482 --> 16:23.918
Good luck with your sister.

16:35.796 --> 16:37.531
Are these three seats taken?

16:39.333 --> 16:42.936
It's amazing how my head,
body, and legs

16:42.970 --> 16:46.839
can all be so uncomfortable
at the same time.

16:46.874 --> 16:49.242
Have you been here all night
waiting up for me?

16:49.276 --> 16:52.011
Me?
No.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.579
The gift shop opens at 8:00.

16:53.614 --> 16:55.581
I wanted to get in early
before there's a run

16:55.616 --> 17:00.519
on stuffed whales
in top hats.

17:00.554 --> 17:03.489
Hey.

17:03.523 --> 17:08.193
It's gonna be okay.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.862
You're okay.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.997
Thanks.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.066
Mm-hmm.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.368
Okay, you ready
to figure out who did this?

17:17.403 --> 17:21.138
Shen has a friend at
the Asian Cultural Organization.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.942
State's asked us
to stand down.

17:23.977 --> 17:25.144
We're not gonna do anything?

17:25.178 --> 17:28.414
It's not fair.
I know.

17:32.053 --> 17:34.555
Did we get the soup bowl
when we swept the hotel?

17:34.589 --> 17:36.390
- Seems like us.
- Can we analyze it?

17:36.425 --> 17:38.192
Maybe we can use
the radioactive signature.

17:38.227 --> 17:40.428
Well, as revealing
as that would be,

17:40.462 --> 17:43.464
our internal labs
can't touch it.

17:43.499 --> 17:47.201
But?

17:47.235 --> 17:49.302
But...

17:49.336 --> 17:50.637
I have a friend that works

17:50.671 --> 17:52.839
in Johns Hopkins
Radiobiology Lab,

17:52.873 --> 17:54.674
and he could take a look.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.976
You have a friend everywhere.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.511
Friends come in handy
at times like this.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.947
They certainly do.

18:07.453 --> 18:09.520
Oh, I got your message
that it was okay

18:09.554 --> 18:11.556
to come back to my house.

18:11.590 --> 18:15.093
What was going on last night?

18:15.127 --> 18:18.796
It was a precautionary
radiation sweep by an ops team.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.164
I'm a covert officer

18:20.199 --> 18:22.333
for the Central Intelligence
Agency.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.270
I have been for two years.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.873
You're not serious.

18:28.907 --> 18:31.609
Think about it.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.211
Prove it.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.290
I'm a spy.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.225
This is my life.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.273
Come on, Danielle.
Can we--

19:13.888 --> 19:16.356
Okay, you want to talk?
Let's talk.

19:16.391 --> 19:18.759
All right, you're a spy.
Since when?

19:18.793 --> 19:20.728
I said two years.

19:20.763 --> 19:22.363
- At Langley?
- Yes.

19:22.398 --> 19:25.066
- And what do you do?
- I gather intelligence.

19:25.101 --> 19:28.137
And those trips--
Cleveland, Topeka, Des Moines?

19:28.171 --> 19:29.238
Those were lies.

19:29.273 --> 19:31.474
I went other places
for the Agency.

19:31.508 --> 19:33.009
Paris?

19:33.043 --> 19:34.444
I did go to Paris.

19:34.478 --> 19:38.448
And the accidents,
the bruises?

19:38.483 --> 19:40.484
They weren't
stapler accidents.

19:40.518 --> 19:42.086
What happened?

19:42.120 --> 19:43.854
I can't tell you.

19:43.888 --> 19:47.024
No, if we're gonna do this,
you have to tell me everything.

19:47.058 --> 19:49.494
I am telling you
everything I can.

19:49.528 --> 19:50.762
Okay, why?

19:50.796 --> 19:54.199
Why do you choose to do this?

19:54.233 --> 19:58.368
I am good at it.

19:58.403 --> 19:59.870
I love it.

20:14.518 --> 20:15.852
You wanted to see me?

20:15.886 --> 20:18.389
I'll keep this brief.

20:18.423 --> 20:20.291
I know you're not happy here
at the DPD,

20:20.325 --> 20:23.528
and I'm not happy having people
who aren't happy in my division.

20:23.562 --> 20:25.997
Are you saying you want me
to be happier?

20:26.032 --> 20:28.567
In essence, yes.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.436
I'm going to authorize
a transfer

20:30.471 --> 20:32.171
to the Southwest Station.

20:32.206 --> 20:34.608
Southwest Asia?

20:34.642 --> 20:36.643
No.
Phoenix.

20:36.678 --> 20:39.079
We're expanding
domestic offices.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.581
It's a new,
exciting opportunity.

20:40.616 --> 20:42.383
I wish you the best of luck.

20:42.418 --> 20:43.985
And if I don't want to go?

20:44.019 --> 20:45.687
Then I guess
you'll still be unhappy.

20:45.721 --> 20:46.821
It'll just be in Phoenix.

21:06.742 --> 21:08.743
I smell Ostrowski's.

21:08.777 --> 21:11.212
Dan, you here?

21:11.246 --> 21:13.948
Hey, Auggie.
Long time no see.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.684
For me as well, Dan.

21:16.718 --> 21:18.319
There he is.

21:18.353 --> 21:20.054
Hey, buddy.

21:20.089 --> 21:22.357
Listen,
I came across a soup bowl

21:22.391 --> 21:25.426
that I think
might be worth something.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.631
Oh, uh, this particular
soup bowl

21:29.665 --> 21:33.267
could be served
on the finest periodic tables.

21:33.302 --> 21:35.937
I was wondering
if maybe you could help me

21:35.971 --> 21:37.605
figure out its true value.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.807
I'll establish
a radiological profile

21:39.842 --> 21:41.142
and an origin pattern,

21:41.176 --> 21:44.845
but it'll have to happen
after hours and off-book.

21:44.879 --> 21:46.347
Understood.

21:54.254 --> 21:56.121
Please come in.

21:56.155 --> 21:58.790
My secretary said it was
a matter of some urgency.

21:58.824 --> 22:01.525
I heard you have some news
about Shen.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.861
He wanted me to come
and see you.

22:03.895 --> 22:05.362
You know where he is?

22:05.396 --> 22:07.031
He disappeared
from the conference.

22:07.065 --> 22:08.866
I've been trying to reach him.

22:08.900 --> 22:11.402
He's sick.

22:11.436 --> 22:14.204
That's terrible.
Shen Yue is a dear friend.

22:14.239 --> 22:17.208
Known each other since our days
back at Beida University.

22:17.242 --> 22:18.643
If there is anything
I can do...

22:22.748 --> 22:24.782
Do you know anyone
who would want to harm him?

22:24.816 --> 22:26.817
Harm him?
No.

22:30.722 --> 22:32.023
What is beeping?

22:36.895 --> 22:38.863
It's nothing.

22:47.205 --> 22:50.808
Why is a translator doing
the bidding of Shen Yue?

22:52.177 --> 22:56.013
There are few people in D.C.
he felt he could trust.

22:56.048 --> 23:00.284
And he trusted you,
who he has known for how long?

23:00.319 --> 23:02.753
Just 'cause you've known
someone a long time

23:02.787 --> 23:05.922
doesn't mean
you can trust them.

23:05.957 --> 23:08.024
Wise words for a translator.

23:08.059 --> 23:09.459
You listen to people speak,

23:09.493 --> 23:13.529
you learn to interpret what
they mean, not what they say.

23:13.563 --> 23:14.596
Indeed.

23:14.631 --> 23:18.633
I'll be in touch
if I hear anything.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.434
Thank you for coming.

23:20.469 --> 23:24.738
Thanks for your time.

23:33.348 --> 23:35.816
Ow!

23:35.851 --> 23:39.086
It was January of last year.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.388
I'm--I'm sorry.
Can you repeat that, please?

23:41.423 --> 23:44.592
It was January of last year.

23:44.626 --> 23:46.827
Leave us alone.

23:46.862 --> 23:48.329
Uh, we're not done.

23:48.363 --> 23:50.831
Yeah, you are.

23:56.238 --> 23:58.006
How do you know Xi Peng?

23:58.040 --> 24:00.609
Did you talk to him?
What did he say?

24:00.643 --> 24:02.411
He didn't say anything.

24:02.446 --> 24:05.581
My dosimeter went off
when I was in his office.

24:05.615 --> 24:07.817
Either he has
a radioactive signature

24:07.851 --> 24:10.519
or there was Polonium there.

24:10.554 --> 24:13.022
He poisoned you.

24:13.056 --> 24:15.758
How do you know him, Shen?

24:15.793 --> 24:17.093
Come inside.

24:17.127 --> 24:19.261
It's fine.

24:19.296 --> 24:21.130
Come--come--come here.

24:26.736 --> 24:28.703
Xi Peng was...

24:28.738 --> 24:30.438
I thought a friend.

24:30.473 --> 24:32.874
Did you tell him
you were defecting?

24:32.908 --> 24:35.876
Keeping secrets is a burden.

24:35.911 --> 24:38.779
I wanted to be able
to trust someone.

24:38.813 --> 24:42.983
We knew each other
from university.

24:43.017 --> 24:45.752
We met
just after my brother died.

24:45.786 --> 24:50.657
We spoke about our hopes
of a different China

24:50.691 --> 24:54.161
for many years.

24:54.195 --> 24:56.830
I told him everything.

24:56.864 --> 24:58.332
He betrayed you.

24:58.366 --> 25:02.169
Do you know what it's like
to trust someone completely...

25:02.204 --> 25:04.872
Enough that you would change
your whole life

25:04.907 --> 25:08.510
based on their trust?

25:08.544 --> 25:10.512
Yeah.

25:10.546 --> 25:12.514
I know how important trust is.

25:12.548 --> 25:13.848
Now I wonder...

25:13.883 --> 25:17.353
When did he betray me?

25:17.387 --> 25:19.889
What part of our friendship
was real?

25:19.923 --> 25:21.825
Don't worry, Shen.
We're gonna make this right.

25:21.859 --> 25:25.662
Annie,
Xi Peng is not touchable.

25:25.696 --> 25:28.831
His father is, uh,
high ranking in the Politburo.

25:28.865 --> 25:31.533
The CIA takes care
of its own.

25:31.568 --> 25:36.437
I never imagined being
this trusted by the CIA...

25:36.472 --> 25:40.608
or betrayed by my good friend.

25:40.642 --> 25:44.479
You're gonna get
out of here.

25:44.513 --> 25:47.082
And then we're gonna go
to a ball game--

25:47.116 --> 25:49.918
peanuts, beer...

25:49.953 --> 25:52.154
The whole deal.

25:55.693 --> 25:58.329
I'd like that very much.

26:11.684 --> 26:14.214
Annie.

26:14.215 --> 26:15.682
Scott.

26:15.716 --> 26:17.050
Hi.

26:17.084 --> 26:20.922
We had a date,
and I totally didn't show.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.356
Are you okay?

26:22.391 --> 26:24.491
I'm fine.
I'm just a little scattered.

26:24.526 --> 26:26.159
No, your arm.

26:26.194 --> 26:27.827
Oh.
Oh!

26:27.862 --> 26:30.363
Um, it's nothing.
Actually, I have to go.

26:30.398 --> 26:32.098
I'm gonna go fix you up now.

26:32.132 --> 26:35.734
And that's not a question.

26:38.404 --> 26:41.005
Look, Scott...

26:41.040 --> 26:43.974
I think you're amazing...

26:44.009 --> 26:47.044
The most amazing guy I've met
in a long time, actually.

26:47.079 --> 26:50.314
It's okay.

26:50.348 --> 26:53.017
My life is just...

26:53.051 --> 26:56.755
Complicated right now.

26:58.057 --> 27:02.027
Those stitches should dissolve
in about a month.

27:02.061 --> 27:05.264
By then, I should be
just about healed, too.

27:07.401 --> 27:10.236
Got your compensation.

27:13.407 --> 27:14.975
Any results from the lab?

27:15.009 --> 27:18.012
The Polonium was refined
from U-238

27:18.046 --> 27:21.349
at the Benxi Mine in
the Liaoning province in China.

27:21.384 --> 27:24.552
And anything
on the spectromic signature,

27:24.587 --> 27:25.753
any geiger matches?

27:25.788 --> 27:27.288
Auggie, I had no choice.

27:27.322 --> 27:29.890
- Cuff him.
- What?

27:29.924 --> 27:32.992
Under arrest for possession
of fissile material.

27:33.027 --> 27:34.928
<i>Et tu,</i> Dan?

27:34.962 --> 27:36.596
I'm sorry, Auggie.

27:36.630 --> 27:39.499
Can't believe you're pulling
a Lando Calrissian on me.

27:41.035 --> 27:43.069
How'd you come into possession
of that bowl?

27:43.103 --> 27:44.971
That's a funny story,
actually.

27:45.005 --> 27:49.042
I was, uh, on an antiquing trip
in Brimfield, Massachusetts.

27:49.076 --> 27:51.511
Do you know that antique fair?

27:51.545 --> 27:53.546
No?
It's a good one.

27:53.581 --> 27:55.448
Some real finds,
real gems.

27:55.483 --> 27:58.084
You just have to get there early
and haggle.

27:58.119 --> 28:01.121
Anyway, I-I got the bowl
from this gypsy lady.

28:01.156 --> 28:02.957
She said it might be
worth something.

28:02.991 --> 28:04.926
You in the habit
of authenticating the value

28:04.960 --> 28:07.996
of flea market soup bowls
at nuclear laboratories?

28:08.030 --> 28:10.064
Only when they don't come
in sets.

28:22.812 --> 28:26.214
Annie, my office.

28:26.248 --> 28:28.350
Sit down.

28:28.384 --> 28:30.618
I went to
the Asian Cultural Organization.

28:30.653 --> 28:33.354
And accused Xi Peng
of poisoning Shen--I know.

28:33.389 --> 28:35.323
Xi Peng told State.

28:35.357 --> 28:37.125
He did poison Shen.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.493
He had a letter opener

28:38.527 --> 28:40.795
with a P.L.A. Special Forces
insignia on it.

28:40.830 --> 28:43.031
He's a spy.
I know it.

28:43.065 --> 28:44.165
That could have been a gift.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.767
That could have been
a scare tactic.

28:45.801 --> 28:48.670
He's radioactive.

28:48.704 --> 28:50.004
I forgot to take off
my dosimeter.

28:50.039 --> 28:52.540
Either it was beeping
because he touched the Polonium

28:52.575 --> 28:54.008
or it was in his office.

28:54.042 --> 28:56.143
Either way, Xi Peng is our guy.

28:56.177 --> 28:57.878
We have to act.

28:57.912 --> 28:59.880
This has moved
beyond us, Annie.

28:59.914 --> 29:01.381
Why?
Because of State?

29:01.415 --> 29:04.117
Auggie is in custody because
of your need to push this.

29:04.151 --> 29:05.719
I've had to make a deal
with state

29:05.753 --> 29:07.721
to keep this off-book.

29:07.755 --> 29:09.223
What kind of deal?

29:09.257 --> 29:12.459
The kind of deal you make
when you're bent over a barrel.

29:26.043 --> 29:28.177
I'm sorry.

29:28.212 --> 29:30.213
The antidote was a long shot.

29:49.368 --> 29:50.568
Danielle?

29:50.602 --> 29:53.370
Don't worry.
Everything's labeled.

29:58.142 --> 30:00.176
- You're kicking me out.
- We're gonna need more boxes.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.177
You certainly have
a lot of shoes.

30:02.212 --> 30:04.113
You just started packing up
my stuff.

30:04.147 --> 30:07.082
It's okay. I didn't try
to crack your spy safe.

30:07.117 --> 30:08.918
Uh, can we talk about this?

30:08.952 --> 30:10.886
No, you've had two years
to talk about this.

30:10.921 --> 30:13.489
That's what this weekend
was all about.

30:13.523 --> 30:14.790
I-I was gonna tell you.

30:14.825 --> 30:17.326
Oh, really?
Or is that another lie?

30:17.361 --> 30:19.729
Because right now I can't
believe a single word you say.

30:19.763 --> 30:21.030
Yes, you can.

30:21.064 --> 30:22.464
You are very good
at getting people

30:22.499 --> 30:23.799
to believe
exactly what you want--

30:23.834 --> 30:25.034
even me, especially me.

30:25.068 --> 30:27.102
You're an amazing liar.

30:27.137 --> 30:29.471
I did all this to protect you,
all of this!

30:29.506 --> 30:31.840
Oh, since when
do you get to decide

30:31.875 --> 30:35.344
what to protect me from,
what to tell me and when?

30:35.378 --> 30:37.079
You're my little sister.

30:37.113 --> 30:38.180
And you're my big sister.

30:38.214 --> 30:40.216
I hoped we could work
through this.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.251
Okay, the only thing
that matters to me right now

30:42.285 --> 30:45.521
is protecting my kids,
keeping them safe.

30:45.556 --> 30:48.858
And I don't feel they're safe
with you here,

30:48.892 --> 30:50.693
with you--the person
that I trusted

30:50.727 --> 30:52.695
more than anyone in the world.

30:52.729 --> 30:55.197
Danielle, I'm in the CIA.
Nothing else is different.

30:55.231 --> 30:57.733
Everything's different.

30:57.767 --> 31:00.602
Someone from the hospital
dropped off this bag.

31:00.637 --> 31:04.106
I wouldn't bother
unpacking it.

31:41.846 --> 31:43.947
Hmm.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.508
Okay.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.344
Auggie!

31:53.378 --> 31:56.947
Auggie.

31:56.982 --> 32:00.384
- I'm so sorry you got caught.
- Ah, no Biggie.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.986
Coffee in the State Department
is surprisingly good.

32:03.021 --> 32:05.289
Our relations with Colombia
must have improved.

32:05.323 --> 32:07.825
Shen left me a back door
into his intel.

32:07.859 --> 32:10.461
He must have feared something
like this was going to happen.

32:10.495 --> 32:12.129
All good spies
know the risks.

32:12.163 --> 32:13.664
The Chinese are pulling
weapons-grade uranium

32:13.698 --> 32:14.765
out of the Benxi Mines.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.200
Funny
that you should say that.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.436
Before I was
unceremoniously pinched,

32:18.470 --> 32:20.238
I found out
that the raw uranium

32:20.272 --> 32:23.240
used to process Shen's poison
was extracted from--

32:23.274 --> 32:26.243
you guessed it--
China's Benxi Mine.

32:26.277 --> 32:30.214
And guess who owns a 17% share
of that mine.

32:30.248 --> 32:31.982
Xi Peng.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.184
There's our hand
in the cookie jar.

32:41.659 --> 32:43.960
What just happened?
Was that Joan?

32:43.995 --> 32:44.995
Yeah.

32:45.029 --> 32:46.930
She walked out
without saying anything.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.299
That can't be good.

32:49.333 --> 32:51.067
I'm having
a management problem.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.402
I thought you liked
initiative.

32:52.436 --> 32:53.837
This involves State.

32:53.871 --> 32:55.171
Let me make your day
a little easier.

32:55.206 --> 32:58.209
You don't work for State
or for that hothead Steve Barr.

32:58.243 --> 33:00.344
No, I work for you.

33:00.378 --> 33:01.579
You work for the CIA.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.149
You run your own division
however you see fit.

33:09.189 --> 33:10.489
Thank you.

33:10.524 --> 33:13.359
But you knew that already.

33:13.393 --> 33:17.297
So what do you need from me?

33:20.801 --> 33:22.668
Arthur...

33:22.702 --> 33:24.836
What brings you
across the Potomac?

33:24.870 --> 33:26.805
Why don't we step
in my office?

33:26.839 --> 33:29.607
Excuse me.

33:35.981 --> 33:37.115
What's this?

33:37.149 --> 33:39.785
Legal briefs
from our general counsel...

33:39.820 --> 33:41.954
Detailing the six counts
on which Xi Peng

33:41.989 --> 33:44.658
is breaking the international
Atomic Energy Treaty

33:44.692 --> 33:45.725
by allowing enriched uranium

33:45.760 --> 33:48.629
from the Benxi Mine
across borders.

33:48.663 --> 33:50.063
It's ironclad.

33:50.098 --> 33:52.299
We've informed the Chinese.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.868
They're anxious to have Xi Peng
pulled in to face prosecution.

33:54.903 --> 33:58.638
We have a team doing that
even as we speak.

33:58.673 --> 34:01.307
You asshole.

34:03.510 --> 34:06.312
You bigfoot the CIA...

34:06.346 --> 34:08.447
You play hardball
with my wife,

34:08.482 --> 34:10.882
and you expect me to sit back
and take this shit?

34:10.917 --> 34:13.918
This is what we do.

34:22.795 --> 34:26.600
Xi Peng and his contingent
are at a banquet in Chinatown.

34:26.634 --> 34:28.534
We have an ops team en route.

34:28.570 --> 34:32.239
We need eyes
on Xi Peng A.S.A.P.

34:53.661 --> 34:55.629
Xi Peng's definitely
in the group.

34:55.664 --> 34:59.967
He's in the first car
in the convoy...

35:00.001 --> 35:04.071
Passenger side, rear door.

35:04.105 --> 35:06.306
We are go.
Go, all units.

35:06.341 --> 35:08.008
Ground team, go.

35:13.815 --> 35:15.950
Split up and take him down.

35:26.863 --> 35:30.098
Convoy is proceeding west
at 40 miles per hour.

35:30.132 --> 35:32.967
We'll have you out
to the intercept at 30 meters...

35:37.940 --> 35:40.942
20, 10.

35:53.655 --> 35:57.459
Don't move!
Hands on the wheel!

35:57.493 --> 35:59.161
Hands on the wheel!
Don't move!

36:03.267 --> 36:06.937
Xi Peng is not
in the vehicle.

36:19.051 --> 36:21.453
I've got a visual on him.
He's on foot.

37:06.935 --> 37:08.768
Walk.
Walk.

37:17.498 --> 37:18.631
You killed your friend,

37:18.666 --> 37:20.199
and you're taking
an American hostage?

37:20.234 --> 37:21.668
You're some cultural attache.

37:21.702 --> 37:24.037
I'm not taking you hostage.

37:24.071 --> 37:26.739
And Shen was never my friend.

38:41.410 --> 38:43.979
Hey, it's Jai.

38:44.013 --> 38:46.014
We need to talk.

38:54.323 --> 38:56.792
Do you want something
to eat?

38:56.826 --> 39:00.930
I don't know.
Do I?

39:00.964 --> 39:03.032
I know I lost it before.

39:03.067 --> 39:06.136
I'm just trying to process
all this.

39:06.170 --> 39:07.338
Oh, my God.
What happened?

39:07.372 --> 39:10.374
Oh, uh...

39:12.977 --> 39:16.847
I can't tell you.

39:16.881 --> 39:21.518
It wasn't
a stapler accident?

39:21.553 --> 39:23.554
Here, Katia always finds
this helpful.

39:26.925 --> 39:28.959
Thanks.

39:30.828 --> 39:33.463
Do you remember
when we were really little,

39:33.498 --> 39:35.399
when dad was teaching
at West Point,

39:35.433 --> 39:38.436
and we'd go skating
on that pond in Cold Spring?

39:38.470 --> 39:39.971
Yeah.

39:40.005 --> 39:42.941
And you'd stay out
until after dark,

39:42.975 --> 39:45.310
and I'd stay out with you
because I was afraid

39:45.345 --> 39:47.379
you'd fall through the ice?

39:50.750 --> 39:54.987
I wanted to protect you.

39:55.022 --> 39:56.422
But now...

39:56.456 --> 39:58.724
I see you don't need me

39:58.759 --> 40:02.729
or anyone to protect you.

40:02.763 --> 40:06.199
You are so brave.

40:06.234 --> 40:09.370
I do need you...

40:09.404 --> 40:11.305
More than you know.

40:16.079 --> 40:19.048
Which is what makes this...

40:19.082 --> 40:20.649
so hard.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.292
Annie, I still need you
to move out.

40:32.730 --> 40:37.333
Okay.

40:37.368 --> 40:39.969
I'll move out.

41:08.100 --> 41:09.301
Thanks for going with me.

41:09.335 --> 41:11.102
I know it's probably not
that fun for you.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.136
Are you kidding me?

41:12.170 --> 41:14.572
The crack of the bat,
cold beer--

41:14.606 --> 41:16.473
I may even catch a foul ball.

41:16.508 --> 41:18.976
You know we're sitting in the
left-field bleachers, right?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.211
Home run.
Even better.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.049
Is it worth it?

41:26.083 --> 41:28.584
This job?

41:28.619 --> 41:31.154
Well, that's a big question.

41:31.188 --> 41:33.624
Short answer is yes.

41:33.658 --> 41:36.160
What's the long answer?

41:36.194 --> 41:38.529
The long answer, uh,
is that when the job

41:38.563 --> 41:40.964
gets tough and draining,
sometimes the best solution

41:40.999 --> 41:43.935
is to throw oneself back
into the job.

41:43.969 --> 41:48.339
That's where you'll find out
whether it's worth it or not.

41:48.373 --> 41:50.675
I'd need an assignment
for that.

41:50.710 --> 41:52.811
Funny you should say that.

41:52.845 --> 41:57.082
I happen to know that Joan
wants you on a plane tomorrow.

41:57.116 --> 41:59.452
Tomorrow?

41:59.486 --> 42:02.755
Sorry.
The job's the job.

42:02.790 --> 42:04.891
What do you know about this
assignment that I don't know?

42:04.925 --> 42:06.526
You gonna open it?

42:06.560 --> 42:08.061
You said I don't leave
till tomorrow, right?

42:08.095 --> 42:09.862
Yep.

42:09.896 --> 42:13.666
Then for now, we have
a baseball game to enjoy.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.034
Yes, we do.
