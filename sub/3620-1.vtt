00:11.663 --> 00:14.753
ONCE AGAIN,
I'M VERY SORRY.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.625
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.192
VICTOR...

00:18.366 --> 00:19.671
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.109
MY CONDOLENCES.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.635
Woman:WE LOVE YOU,
PUMPKIN.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.900
Man: YOU TWO
WERE CLOSE?

00:31.074 --> 00:33.120
I'VE KNOWN HER
FOR SO MANY YEARS.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.730
IT'S SO SAD,
YOU KNOW?

00:34.904 --> 00:36.949
IT'S ALL
SO VERY SAD.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.140
PRETTY GOOD TURN-OUT,
HUH?

00:54.576 --> 00:55.490
PHOEBE?

00:55.664 --> 00:58.101
NO, DAD, I'M PIPER.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.711
THAT'S PHOEBE.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.757
CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW MANY LEPRECHAUNS
ARE AT MY URN.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.237
WELL, THEY ALWAYS HAD
THE HOTS FOR YA.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.847
IT'S KIND OF CREEPY,

01:05.021 --> 01:07.110
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN'T BE
TOO PICKY WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.981
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE DRIVING
ME CRAZY, YOU KNOW THAT?

01:09.156 --> 01:10.157
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN,
WILL YA?

01:10.331 --> 01:12.811
AND LOOK
A LITTLE MORE BEREAVED.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.161
AGENT KEYES IS WATCHING.

01:14.335 --> 01:17.686
DON'T WORRY.
HE'LL NEVER FIGURE US OUT.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.166
HOW COULD HE?

01:19.340 --> 01:20.210
HEY, I STILL
CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.690
WELL, AT LEAST
WE'RE ALIVE,

01:21.864 --> 01:23.779
AND, MORE
IMPORTANTLY, FREE.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.173
YEAH, BUT DO YOU HAVE TO
KEEP CHANGING YOUR LOOKS
ALL THE TIME?

01:26.347 --> 01:28.088
I MEAN, JUST PICK ONE
AND STICK WITH IT, WOULD YOU?

01:28.262 --> 01:29.872
WHY? IT'S FUN.

01:30.046 --> 01:32.353
POOR PAIGE. NOT A LOT
OF PEOPLE AT HER URN.

01:32.527 --> 01:36.313
I KNOW. GOOD THING
SHE'S NOT HERE TO SEE THAT.

01:36.487 --> 01:37.532
Woman: EXCUSE ME.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.447
[GASP]

01:39.621 --> 01:42.014
EXCUSE ME.

01:43.538 --> 01:47.498
WHOA. WHAT'S
JANICE DICKINSON DOING HERE?

01:47.672 --> 01:49.370
OH, PAIGE!

01:49.544 --> 01:50.980
SHE KNEW PAIGE?

01:51.154 --> 01:53.200
WOW, I'M IMPRESSED.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.158
YOU WERE THE BEST FRIEND
I EVER HAD!

01:55.332 --> 01:56.899
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITHOUT YOU?

02:00.555 --> 02:01.556
CAN WE TALK TO YOU
A MINUTE?

02:01.730 --> 02:02.687
IN PRIVATE?

02:02.861 --> 02:05.125
EXCUSE ME!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.476
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

02:08.650 --> 02:11.305
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO I AM?

02:11.479 --> 02:12.480
YEAH.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.135
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WE DO...

02:16.353 --> 02:17.963
PAIGE.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.051
I'M SORRY, WHO?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.751
NICE TRY. JIG'S UP.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.057
OH, ALL RIGHT THEN.
FINE.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.844
WELL, SOMEBODY HAD TO
CRY AT MY FUNERAL,
DIDN'T THEY?

03:26.815 --> 03:28.556
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.471
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

03:30.645 --> 03:31.994
I WAS THINKING
THAT I OBVIOUSLY SPENT

03:32.168 --> 03:33.691
TOO MUCH TIME
IN THE MAGICAL WORLD

03:33.865 --> 03:35.476
BECAUSE NOBODY EVEN CARES
THAT I'M DEAD.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.652
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU HAVE MOURNERS.

03:37.826 --> 03:40.568
I MEAN, THERE ARE
LOTS OF LEPRECHAUNS
OUT THERE.

03:40.742 --> 03:41.830
I MEAN REAL PEOPLE.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.049
WELL, THERE WAS
YOUR FRIEND GLENN.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.355
YEAH, GLENN
WAS AT YOUR URN,

03:45.529 --> 03:47.314
AND RUTHY
OUR NEIGHBOR.

03:47.488 --> 03:48.967
NO, SHE WAS JUST GOING
TO GET COFFEE.

03:49.141 --> 03:49.968
OH, REALLY?

03:50.142 --> 03:51.056
MY POINT EXACTLY.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.277
OH, MY GOD.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.800
[GASP]

03:55.974 --> 03:57.149
WE CAN EXPLAIN.
IT'S, UM...

03:57.324 --> 03:59.239
DON'T BOTHER.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.327
[SNAPS FINGERS]

04:02.851 --> 04:05.027
OH, YOU SCARED ME.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.724
I THOUGHT
WE WERE BUSTED.

04:06.898 --> 04:07.812
WELL, YOU ARE GONNA BE
IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BACK.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.118
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:09.292 --> 04:12.077
APPARENTLY HAVING
AN IDENTITY CRISIS.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.951
OH, SO IT'S OK
FOR YOU TO CHANGE
YOUR HUSBAND INTO--

04:16.125 --> 04:17.692
[GASP] OW.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.128
WHAT'S WRONG?

04:19.302 --> 04:20.782
IT'S THAT JINGLING
IN MY HEAD.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.697
DOES THAT MEAN
THE ELDERS
KNOW SHE'S ALIVE?

04:22.871 --> 04:24.089
NO, THEY CAN'T.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.700
WE CLOAKED OURSELVES
FROM THEM.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.136
IT COULD BE
A NEW CHARGE.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.398
YOU KNOW, A CONNECTION

04:28.572 --> 04:29.443
TO ONE'S WHITELIGHTER
IS AUTOMATIC.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.880
OK, WELL,
JUST IGNORE IT.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.098
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.839
YOU ARE NOT HALF
WHITELIGHTER, OK?

04:36.711 --> 04:38.278
MAYBE IT'S
ONE OF THE MOURNERS.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.063
COULD BE A DEMON
OUT THERE.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.934
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO!

04:43.108 --> 04:45.459
NO. NO DEMONS.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.594
WHY? IT MAKES SENSE,
DOESN'T IT?

04:50.768 --> 04:52.596
I MEAN, THEY'D
PROBABLY WANT TO FIND OUT
IF WE'RE REALLY DEAD.

04:52.770 --> 04:53.858
Phoebe:
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WE'RE RETIRED.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.077
WE DON'T DO DEMONS
ANYMORE.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.383
SHE'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE JUST GONNA

04:56.557 --> 04:57.645
HAVE TO FORGET
ABOUT IT.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.690
NOT SO EASY
WITH THE JINGLE JANGLE.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.213
WHAT IS HE
DOING HERE?

05:01.388 --> 05:02.519
Piper: HE WHO?

05:02.693 --> 05:04.304
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
HE KNEW I EXISTED.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.392
Paige: WHO IS HE?

05:05.566 --> 05:06.741
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.046
IT'S SOME GUY
THAT I USED TO SEE

05:08.220 --> 05:09.613
IN THE ELEVATOR
ALL THE TIME AT WORK.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.615
HE'S KINDA CUTE.

05:11.789 --> 05:12.834
Phoebe: YEAH.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.792
OK, PEOPLE, MORPH NOW,
OGLE LATER.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.141
COME ON, WE CAN'T
RISK BEING CAUGHT.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.361
CHOPPITY CHOP
CHOP CHOP!

05:18.535 --> 05:23.366
OF COURSE, I DON'T KNOW
IF PHOEBE EVER THOUGHT
OF ME AS HER FRIEND...

05:23.540 --> 05:25.150
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF HER AS MINE.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.806
I KNOW FOR A FACT
SHE'S REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE HERE, ELISE.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.374
WHEN I SAY "I KNOW,"

05:31.548 --> 05:33.420
I MEAN IN THE ETHEREAL
SENSE, OF COURSE.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.378
CHANNELING, SENSING.

05:35.552 --> 05:36.814
OF COURSE.

05:41.471 --> 05:44.735
I NEVER REALIZED
SHE KNEW SO MANY
LITTLE PEOPLE, THOUGH.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.389
YES.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.133
YOU MUST BE DEVASTATED,
MR. BENNET.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.439
YEAH.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.658
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
HOW IT HAPPENED.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.313
WAS THERE EVER
AN OFFICIAL CAUSE
OF DEATH?

05:57.487 --> 05:58.445
EXCUSE ME?

05:58.619 --> 06:00.272
FORGIVE ME FOR PRYING.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.711

ALWAYS MADE IT SOUND
SO MYSTERIOUS.

AND WITH NO REMAINS...

06:06.714 --> 06:08.672
I'M SORRY.

06:10.457 --> 06:11.675

06:11.849 --> 06:13.982

MY DAUGHTERS HOW?

06:14.156 --> 06:16.245
BY REPUTATION.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.944
TELL ME, DID THE POLICE
EVER FIND YOUR SON-IN-LAW
BY ANY CHANCE?

06:20.118 --> 06:21.598
LEO?

06:21.772 --> 06:24.949
NO, THEY THINK HE DIED
IN THE ACCIDENT AS WELL.

06:25.123 --> 06:28.431
AND NOW YOU HAVE
TO RAISE THOSE BOYS
ALL BY YOURSELF...

06:29.954 --> 06:32.609
IN THIS HUGE HOUSE.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.483
IF YOU FIND THAT YOU
NEED TO SELL IT, THOUGH,

06:36.657 --> 06:39.137
LET ME KNOW.

06:39.311 --> 06:40.617
I'D BE GLAD TO HELP.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.577
YOU'RE
A REAL ESTATE AGENT?

06:43.751 --> 06:46.580
I SPECIALIZE
IN THE MOVING
OF PROBLEM PROPERTIES.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.712
YOU KNOW,
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

06:48.886 --> 06:51.672
BUYERS TEND TO BE
A LITTLE QUEASY.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.674
GET OUT.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.679
AGAIN...

06:58.853 --> 07:00.855
MY CONDOLENCES.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.480
WELL?

07:17.654 --> 07:19.003
ARE THEY DEAD OR NOT?

07:19.177 --> 07:20.440
THEY'RE DEAD.

07:20.614 --> 07:21.876
Demons: YEAH!

07:22.050 --> 07:23.530
Elkin: SO WE CAN DO
WHAT WE WANT NOW, RIGHT?

07:23.704 --> 07:25.183
NOBODY CAN STOP US.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.663
EXCEPT FOR OTHER DEMONS.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.578
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
TO ESTABLISH A FOOTHOLD

07:28.752 --> 07:30.711
IN THE MORTAL WORLD
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.061
FIRST, WE MESS
WITH THE MORTALS...

07:33.235 --> 07:34.932
FIRST,
WE DO AS I SAY.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.065
WHO SAYS YOU DECIDE?

07:37.239 --> 07:39.546
THERE'S NO ORDER
TO THE UNDERWORLD ANYMORE.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.287
NOW THAT ZANKOU
AND HIS GENERATION
HAVE BEEN DECIMATED,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.246
IT'S OUR TIME TO PLAY,

07:44.420 --> 07:46.988
WHICH MEANS IT'S
EVERY DEMON FOR HIMSELF.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.599
UNTIL ONE DEMON
RISES TO POWER,

07:49.773 --> 07:52.733
AND THEN
YOU'LL BE FORCED
TO ANSWER TO HIM.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.430
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

07:54.604 --> 07:56.214
WHAT I WANT

07:56.388 --> 07:59.348
IS TO SCARE THE LIVING HELL
OUT OF PEOPLE...

08:00.697 --> 08:01.785
LITERALLY.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.310
EACH TO HIS OWN GIFTS.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.835
FINE THEN. GO.

08:08.009 --> 08:11.795
ME? I WANT OUT
OF THIS HOLE.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.580
TAKE OVER THE SYMBOLIC
SEAT OF POWER

08:13.754 --> 08:16.060
BEFORE
ANYBODY ELSE DOES.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.453
THE CHARMED ONES' HOME?

08:18.759 --> 08:20.456
HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO GET IT?

08:20.630 --> 08:23.241
I'M GOING TO
BUY IT FROM THEIR
FATHER'S ESTATE...

08:23.415 --> 08:25.548
AFTER I KILL HIM.

08:30.727 --> 08:33.251
Agent Murphy:
THIS CASE ISN'T DEAD.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.992
I MEAN, YOU SAID SO
YOURSELF, RIGHT?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.385
SO?

08:36.559 --> 08:37.517
SO THEN WHY ARE WE
HEADING BACK TO D.C.?

08:37.691 --> 08:39.519
WHY AREN'T WE
JUST STAYING HERE?

08:39.693 --> 08:41.608
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.262
YOU SPEND YEARS TRYING
TO PROVE THAT THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE OUT THERE.

08:44.436 --> 08:47.135
ALL RIGHT?
SOME UNSEEN POWER.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.311
BUT THEN YOU WALK
AWAY FROM IT JUST LIKE THAT?

08:49.485 --> 08:50.834
JUST LIKE THAT.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.622
BUT WHAT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO INSPECTOR SHERIDAN?

08:55.796 --> 08:56.971
THAT THING
THAT KILLED HER?

08:57.145 --> 08:58.494
OR WHAT ABOUT THAT COP

08:58.668 --> 09:00.409
WHO SWEARS HE SAW LEO
AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME?

09:00.583 --> 09:01.453
THAT MEANS
HE'S STILL ALIVE--

09:01.628 --> 09:03.543
IT'S OVER, AGENT MURPHY.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.370
THE SISTERS ARE DEAD.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.288
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.553
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:13.727 --> 09:14.684
I DON'T,

09:14.858 --> 09:16.730
BUT I WANT THEM
TO THINK I DO.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.035
IF THEY'RE IN HIDING,

09:18.209 --> 09:19.167
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO RESURFACE

09:19.341 --> 09:20.647
WITH US HANGING AROUND.

09:20.821 --> 09:22.997
SO WE LEAVE,

09:23.171 --> 09:24.302
LET THEM
GET COMFORTABLE,

09:24.476 --> 09:25.565
COMPLACENT.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.218
BUT THEN,
HOW WILL WE KNOW IF--

09:27.392 --> 09:30.178
BECAUSE YOU'RE
GOING TO STAY BEHIND,
THAT'S HOW.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.136
KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS
FOR ME.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.877
YOU LAY LOW, BE PATIENT,

09:34.051 --> 09:36.706
AND GIVE THEM
PLENTY OF SPACE.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.317
IF THEY ARE STILL ALIVE,
THEY'LL COME HOME.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.972
SOONER OR LATER,
EVERYONE ALWAYS DOES.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.415
HOW WELL
DID YOU KNOW PHOEBE?

09:50.590 --> 09:53.027
NOT AS WELL
AS I'D LIKE TO,

09:53.201 --> 09:55.507
BUT I, UH,
LOVED TO READ HER COLUMN.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.596
REALLY?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.336
YEAH, EVERY DAY.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.816
I NEVER
GOT OVER HOW SOMEBODY
AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE WAS

09:59.990 --> 10:01.601
COULD BE
SO INCREDIBLY INSIGHTFUL.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.341
YOU DON'T SAY?

10:03.515 --> 10:04.995
EXCUSE ME. DO YOU MIND?

10:05.169 --> 10:06.301
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT THIS.

10:06.475 --> 10:09.870
YOU WERE SAYING,
ABOUT PHOEBE?

10:10.044 --> 10:12.612
JUST THAT, UH,
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GREAT.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.005
REALLY GREAT.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.181
THEN WHY DIDN'T
YOU EVER ASK HER OUT?

10:17.355 --> 10:18.443
WHAT?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.010
THANKS FOR COMING!

10:20.184 --> 10:22.099
SORRY YOU HAVE TO GO!

10:22.273 --> 10:24.058
OK. BUH-BYE.

10:24.232 --> 10:26.016
PIPER,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:26.190 --> 10:27.365
WHAT ARE YOUDOING?

10:27.539 --> 10:29.324
YOU CAN'T PICK UP
ON A GUY AT A FUNERAL.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.239
WHY NOT?
IT'S MY FUNERAL.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.371
[WYATT CRYING]

10:35.722 --> 10:36.897
IT'S OK, SWEETIE.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.246
MOMMY'S RIGHT HERE.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.379
WYATT, HONEY,
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

10:42.772 --> 10:43.991
HE DOESN'T KNOW
IT'S YOU, PIPER.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.995
IT'S OK, BUDDY,
ALL RIGHT?

10:48.169 --> 10:49.605
DADDY'S HERE, OK?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.259
WE'RE ALL HERE.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.306
OK?

10:55.480 --> 10:56.699
SEE?

10:56.873 --> 10:58.614
POOR LITTLE GUY.
HE'S CONFUSED.

10:58.788 --> 10:59.702
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOIN' ON,

10:59.876 --> 11:01.269
NEITHER DOES BABY CHRIS.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.966
ALL THIS CHANGING
MAKES THEM NERVOUS, I THINK.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.926
YEAH, MAYBE WE DIDN'T EXACTLY
THINK THIS THING THROUGH.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.841
WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO THINK IT THROUGH.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.538
IT'S TOO LATE
TO GO BACK NOW,
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

11:11.845 --> 11:12.672
Phoebe: I THINK
I HAVE AN IDEA.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.369
FOLLOW ME.

11:17.894 --> 11:21.463
OK. IT'S A GOOD THING
WE KEPT THIS.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.421
Piper: YEAH, BUT WE'RE
NOT SUPPOSED TO USE IT.

11:23.595 --> 11:24.988
THE MORE MAGIC
WE USE...

11:25.162 --> 11:27.425
THE MORE LIKELY
THE DEMONS ARE
TO FIND US OUT.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.166
WE DIDN'T SAY
WE'D NEVERUSE MAGIC AGAIN.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.778
BESIDES, I THINK
WE REALLY NEED THIS SPELL.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.562
WHY? WHAT'LL IT DO?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.303
END OUR CONFUSION,
HOPEFULLY.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.392
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT FOR THE LAST
COUPLE OF DAYS,

11:37.566 --> 11:38.915
AND ALL WE NEED TO DO

11:39.089 --> 11:40.787
IS EACH OF US NEEDS
TO COME UP WITH ONE LOOK,

11:40.961 --> 11:43.528
ONE DISGUISE
THAT WE WANT TO PROJECT
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.487
YOU MEAN LIKE
A PERMANENT PERMANENT ONE?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.010
THAT'S THE IDEA.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.533
Victor: NOW, HOW IS THAT
GONNA END THE CONFUSION,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.013
ESPECIALLY FOR THE BOYS?

11:50.187 --> 11:51.188
BECAUSE THEY
WON'T SEE THE DISGUISES,

11:51.362 --> 11:52.842
NEITHER WILL ANY OF US.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.018
OK, JUST TRUST ME.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.672
YOU GUYS HAVE
A LOOK IN MIND?

11:57.847 --> 12:00.371
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NOTHING FLASHY, EITHER.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.983
OK, READY?

12:03.157 --> 12:05.072
"I CALL UPON
THE ANCIENT POWERS

12:05.246 --> 12:07.291
"TO MASK US NOW
AND IN FUTURE HOURS.

12:07.465 --> 12:08.858
"HIDE US WELL
AND THOROUGHLY,

12:09.032 --> 12:11.034
BUT NOT FROM THOSE
WE CALL FAMILY."

12:14.255 --> 12:15.822
WELL, ANYTHING HAPPEN?

12:15.996 --> 12:16.953
DO WE LOOK THE SAME?

12:17.127 --> 12:17.998
YEAH.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.129
MAYBE IT DIDN'T WORK.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.526
IT DEFINITELY WORKED.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.484
OH, MY GOODNESS,
IS THAT ME?

12:26.658 --> 12:28.182
IS IT THE YOU
YOU ENVISIONED?

12:28.356 --> 12:30.706
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
NO FLASH!

12:30.880 --> 12:33.100
IT WAS THE FIRST LOOK
THAT CAME TO MIND.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.318
I LIKE IT.

12:34.492 --> 12:35.711
ECH.

12:35.885 --> 12:36.581
HOW IS IT YOU CAN SEE
YOUR OTHER SELVES

12:36.756 --> 12:37.757
REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.759
IT'S PART
OF THE SPELL.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.848
YOU KNOW,
THIS JUST MIGHT WORK.

12:42.022 --> 12:42.936
OHH!

12:43.110 --> 12:45.329
THE JINGLE AGAIN.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.854
DO YOU THINK THIS
MEANS SOMETHING BAD
IS GONNA HAPPEN?

13:30.505 --> 13:32.594
OK.

13:32.768 --> 13:33.725
HEY,
I'M NOT DONE.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.119
DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU ARE NOW.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.773
IT'S AN IDENTITY,
NOT A NOVEL.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.080
AS LONG
AS THESE REFLECT
WHO WE'RE TRYING TO BE,

13:40.254 --> 13:42.386
AND WHERE WE'VE COME
FROM, WE'RE ALL GOOD.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.869
OK, JULIE, NICE.
JO, JENNY...

13:47.043 --> 13:48.218
LOUIS?

13:48.392 --> 13:49.393
LOUIE.

13:49.567 --> 13:50.830
YOU KNOW, LIKE
LOUIE ARMSTRONG.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.396
YOU KNOW,
THE GREAT SATCHMO?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.659
THE TRUMPETER?

13:54.834 --> 13:58.446
YEAH. I THINK DAD
USED TO LISTEN TO HIM.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.578
Phoebe: OK,
IF YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT,

14:00.752 --> 14:02.189
SO CAN THE GOVERNMENT.

14:09.718 --> 14:12.416
VOILA.
NEW IDENTITIES.

14:12.590 --> 14:13.461
ARE YOU SURE?

14:13.635 --> 14:15.942
ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

14:16.116 --> 14:16.943
LET'S GO SHOPPING.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.031
NO.

14:18.205 --> 14:21.643
YEP. COME ON.NO. WAIT. NO.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.472
COME ON. WE HAVE
7 YEARS OF LOST TIME
TO MAKE UP FOR.

14:24.646 --> 14:25.777
WE HAVE TO START
SOMEWHERE.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.388
UH, YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...

14:27.562 --> 14:29.433
NO BUTS. WE ARE FREE.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.000
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS?

14:31.174 --> 14:33.481
IT MEANS NO MORE DEMONS,
NO MORE COPS.

14:33.655 --> 14:34.699
WE COULD DO
WHATEVER WE WANT.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.006
I KNOW. I KNOW,
BUT STILL...

14:37.180 --> 14:38.660
WOULD YOU PLEASE TALK
SOME SENSE INTO THIS WOMAN?

14:38.834 --> 14:41.228
YOU KNOW
WHAT OCCURRED TO ME--

14:41.402 --> 14:43.708
THAT REAL ESTATE AGENT
YOUR DAD WAS TALKING ABOUT?

14:43.883 --> 14:47.147
IF YA THINK ABOUT IT,
HE MAY BE A...

14:47.321 --> 14:49.845
OH, MY GOD!
IF YOU SAY
THE "D" WORD,

14:50.019 --> 14:51.586
I MIGHT IMPLODE.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.980
COME ON, YOU GUYS,
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:54.154 --> 14:55.372
I MEAN, ISN'T THIS
WHAT WE WANTED?

14:55.546 --> 14:58.810
YES. IT'S JUST--
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE

14:58.985 --> 15:00.247
AS I HAD HOPED,
THAT'S ALL.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.465
YOU KNOW WHY?

15:01.639 --> 15:02.902
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN OUT YET,

15:03.076 --> 15:05.121
AND YOU WILL FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER

15:05.295 --> 15:06.427
IN A NEW
PAIR OF SHOES.

15:06.601 --> 15:07.645
I DON'T NEED NEW SHOES.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.213
THAT'S THE OLD YOU
TALKING.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.519
COME ON, YOU GUYS,

15:11.693 --> 15:13.913
CAN'T WE JUST AT LEAST
TRY TO HAVE FUN?

15:14.087 --> 15:15.871
DON'T WE OWE OURSELVES
THAT MUCH?

15:16.045 --> 15:18.308
YES, WE DO...

15:18.482 --> 15:21.616
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
PAIGE? I MEAN, JO?

15:21.790 --> 15:23.096
THE SHOES ARE ON ME.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.751
UM, I MAY JUST STAY HERE
AND RELAX A LITTLE.

15:26.926 --> 15:31.278
RELAX. I LIKE IT.
RELAX. COME ON.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.496
UNH!

15:40.765 --> 15:43.290
HE WAS NOT
HITTING ON ME.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.509
HE WAS, TOO.
HE WAS PRACTICALLY
DROOLING ON YOU.

15:45.683 --> 15:47.163
OK, FIRST, I'M MARRIED.

15:47.337 --> 15:50.166
SECONDLY,
HE'S A SALESMAN
IN A WOMEN'S SHOE STORE.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.863
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
HE'S NOT GAY?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.083
WHO CARES? JUST ENJOY.
THAT'S OUR NEW MANTRA, RIGHT?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.216
STILL, MAYBE
PAIGE IS RIGHT.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.826
I DON'T THINK
THIS NEW LOOK IS ME.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.219
I THINK YOU LOOK HOT.

15:59.393 --> 16:00.960
EASY, SIS.
DON'T CREEP ME OUT.

16:01.134 --> 16:03.658
HEY, WE'RE NOT SISTERS
ANYMORE, REMEMBER?
WE'RE COUSINS.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.921
STILL CREEPY.

16:06.095 --> 16:10.752
ISN'T THERE ANY PART OF YOU
THAT DOUBTS YOUR DECISION
AT ALL?

16:10.926 --> 16:13.146
NO, I MEAN, I LIKE
BOTH PAIRS OF SHOES,

16:13.320 --> 16:14.408
SO I BOUGHT
BOTH PAIRS OF SHOES.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.192
NO, NOT THE SHOES.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.499
THE PRETENDING TO BE DEAD
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.631
OH, WELL, YEAH,
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY

16:20.805 --> 16:23.504
THERE WERE CERTAIN ASPECTS
OF MY LIFE THAT I REALLY LIKED,

16:23.678 --> 16:25.462
BUT I COULDN'T FULLY ENJOY IT

16:25.636 --> 16:27.421
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE WITCH STUFF.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.684
YEAH,
BUT THE WITCH STUFF
IS WHO WE ARE.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.381
I MEAN, WE CAN'T JUST
WALK AROUND PRETENDING

16:31.555 --> 16:33.122
WE DON'T HAVE
POWERS ANYMORE.

16:33.296 --> 16:36.125
YEAH, BUT PIPER,
NOBODY IS SAYING
THAT WE HAVE TO.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.475
WE JUST DON'T HAVE TO USE
OUR POWERS EVERY OTHER WEEK
TO SAVE THE WORLD.

16:38.649 --> 16:39.955
THAT'S THE ONLY DIFFERENCE.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.262
THAT AND THE FACT THAT
THE LAST 3 DECADES

16:42.436 --> 16:43.959
OF OUR LIFE
ARE SUDDENLY GONE.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.136
WELL, WE HAVE TO GIVE UP
SOMETHING TO GAIN SOMETHING.

16:47.310 --> 16:50.618
LOOK, YOU WANTED A NORMAL LIFE
MORE THAN ALL OF US.

16:50.792 --> 16:54.143
RIGHT? SO WHAT'S CHANGED
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

16:54.317 --> 16:55.927
I'M A LITTLE NEUROTIC.
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

16:56.102 --> 16:57.625
THAT'S NOT IT.
WHAT ELSE IS IT?

16:57.799 --> 16:59.235
IT'S JUST
IT'S A BIG CHANGE,

16:59.409 --> 17:01.498
AND I DON'T DO CHANGE
VERY WELL.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.371
SO, YOU KNOW,
JUST LET ME FREAK OUT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE

17:04.545 --> 17:06.460
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
I'M SURE I'LL BE FINE.

17:06.634 --> 17:10.377
OK. YOU WANNA GO GET
OUR EYEBROWS PLUCKED?

17:10.551 --> 17:13.423
GEE, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT, UH...

17:13.597 --> 17:14.990
NO, I GOTTA
GO CHECK ON P-3

17:15.164 --> 17:17.253
AND MAKE SURE
DAD HASN'T DONE
A LOT OF DAMAGE.

17:17.427 --> 17:18.950
BESIDES, IT'S GONNA BE
THE ONLY THING

17:19.125 --> 17:21.866
THAT WILL PAY
FOR ALL THESE SHOES.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.433
YOU WORRY TOO MUCH, MISSY.

17:23.607 --> 17:24.826
UH-HUH.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.316
Paige: PHOEBE HAS A LIFE
OUTSIDE OF MAGIC,

17:36.490 --> 17:37.839
OR, AT LEAST,
SHE HAD ONE.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.581
PIPER HAS LEO.
PIPER HAS THE BOYS.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.191
WHAT DO I HAVE?
I HAVE A GIANT,

17:42.365 --> 17:44.454
SUCKING HOLE
OF NOTHINGNESS.

17:44.628 --> 17:47.196
OH, PLEASE, PAIGE,
SPARE ME THE DRAMATICS

17:47.370 --> 17:49.068
AND CUT TO THE CHASE,
WILL YOU?

17:49.242 --> 17:51.896
I'VE GOT AN AFTERLIFE
TO LIVE, YOU KNOW.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.028
SEE? EVEN YOU HAVE A LIFE,

17:53.202 --> 17:54.856
AND YOU'RE DEAD.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.988
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.207
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT LIKE

17:58.381 --> 17:59.991
ANYBODY ASKED
FOR MY OPINION

18:00.166 --> 18:02.907
BEFORE ABANDONING
THE CHARMED LEGACY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.953
THANKS, GRAMS.
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.172
YOU'VE BEEN
A GREAT HELP.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.130
LOOK, HONEY, I'M--
I'M SORRY,

18:08.304 --> 18:12.003
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO--WHO GOT YOURSELF
INTO THIS MESS, NOT ME.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.222
I DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE, OK?

18:13.396 --> 18:14.745
WE DIDN'T HAVE
A CHOICE.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.878
WE WERE GOING TO DIE
THE REAL WAY.

18:17.052 --> 18:20.621
I UNDERSTAND,
AND I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.536
WELL, MAYBE I AM A LITTLE,

18:22.710 --> 18:26.279
BUT--BUT MY POINT IS
THAT YOU'VE MADE A CHOICE

18:26.453 --> 18:27.889
WHETHER YOU WERE FORCED
INTO IT OR NOT,

18:28.063 --> 18:29.369
AND YOU'VE GOTTA LIVE
WITH THAT CHOICE,

18:29.543 --> 18:31.022
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.676
WHAT IF I CAN'T?

18:32.850 --> 18:34.156
OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.289
NO, IT'S NOT. I...

18:36.463 --> 18:38.029
I WANT A LIFE
OUTSIDE OF MAGIC.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.553
I REALLY DO, BUT...

18:39.727 --> 18:41.903
BUT WHAT?

18:42.077 --> 18:44.645
BUT IT'S THE JINGLING, OK?

18:44.819 --> 18:46.603
I HEAR IT NIGHT AND DAY,

18:46.777 --> 18:48.736
WHICH MEANS PEOPLE
ARE CONSTANTLY CALLING
FOR MY HELP.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.217
THAT IS JUST
THE WHITELIGHTER IN YOU.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.001
BUT THAT'S STILL ME,
GRAMS,

18:53.175 --> 18:54.916
AND THAT'S STILL MAGIC.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.484
SO WHAT IF I CAN'T EVER
REALLY GET AWAY FROM IT?

18:57.658 --> 19:00.835
WELL...

19:01.009 --> 19:03.794
ONE THING IS FOR SURE,
YOUNG LADY.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.667
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

19:06.841 --> 19:07.668
SITTING AROUND HERE.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.365
YOU WANT A FRESH START?

19:09.539 --> 19:12.063
THEN PULL YOURSELF UP
BY YOUR BOOTSTRAPS,

19:12.238 --> 19:15.066
GET OUT INTO THE WORLD
AND TRY IT ON FOR SIZE.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.329
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.069
I DON'T KNOW.

19:18.244 --> 19:21.421
HEY, YOU DON'T WANT MY ADVICE,
DON'T CONJURE ME NEXT TIME.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.858
NOW GET UP.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.425
GET A GRIP,

19:25.599 --> 19:28.515
AND DON'T COME BACK
UNTIL YOU FIND YOUR THRILL.

19:28.689 --> 19:30.517
NOW GO.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.235
GREAT. JUST GREAT.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.153
OOPS. WHOA.
SORRY. MY FAULT.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.676
NO, SORRY, IT'S MINE.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.374
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.854
WELL, I SAW YOU,
THAT'S FOR SURE.
