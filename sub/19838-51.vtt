<b><i>The King!</i></b>

02:00.010 --> 02:05.020
<b>An x Indebted x Insect</b>

02:18.530 --> 02:22.630
<b>Youpi's attack separated the Hunters.</b>

02:40.180 --> 02:42.670
<b>The central stairway was destroyed,</b>

02:43.010 --> 02:47.180
<b>with Youpi awaiting anyone still looking to ascend.</b>

02:49.020 --> 02:52.140
<b>Behind him were Knuckle and Meleoron,</b>

02:52.140 --> 02:55.070
<b>who had barely managed to 
make it to the second floor.</b>

02:58.490 --> 02:59.280
<b>Below,</b>

03:01.670 --> 03:05.610
<b>the ones hit at closest range 
by Youpi's attack were Shoot...</b>

03:07.210 --> 03:08.290
<b><i>This is bad.</i></b>

03:09.300 --> 03:11.040
<b><i>My leg's destroyed.</i></b>

03:12.490 --> 03:13.400
<b>Shoot!</b>

03:14.640 --> 03:16.080
<b>...and Morel.</b>

03:17.500 --> 03:19.220
<b>The rest is up to you.</b>

03:21.670 --> 03:22.640
<b><i>Knuckle...</i></b>

03:24.410 --> 03:27.380
<b>He couldn't say Knuckle's name out loud.</b>

03:51.360 --> 03:53.040
<b>Stupid tricks!</b>

04:01.290 --> 04:02.950
<b>One attack by Youpi</b>

04:02.950 --> 04:06.220
<b>tore apart the Deep Purple puppets,</b>

04:06.490 --> 04:11.190
<b>but Morel had deliberately 
positioned them with that in mind.</b>

04:18.650 --> 04:21.240
<b><i>They were just decoys?</i></b>

04:24.460 --> 04:26.240
<b><i>That resistance...</i></b>

04:26.970 --> 04:28.990
<b><i>This is more than smoke!</i></b>

04:34.360 --> 04:37.000
<b><i>The weapon was the only 
thing that wasn't smoke?</i></b>

04:41.150 --> 04:44.510
<b>Fool! You won't get away!</b>

04:47.300 --> 04:50.950
<b>After using his own weapon as a decoy,</b>

04:50.950 --> 04:54.020
<b>Morel had no option left but to run.</b>

04:54.480 --> 04:55.520
<b>But...</b>

05:00.480 --> 05:03.750
<b>Knuckle knew exactly what he had to do.</b>

05:04.780 --> 05:06.220
<b><i>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!</i></b>

05:10.290 --> 05:11.040
<b><i>That...</i></b>

05:11.680 --> 05:15.140
<b><i>That punch was meant to send 
him flying over the horizon.</i></b>

05:16.700 --> 05:18.790
<b><i>The total is 590?</i></b>

05:20.690 --> 05:23.670
<b><i>Ten seconds feels like an eternity now...</i></b>

05:25.060 --> 05:28.070
<b>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy applies additional damage</b>

05:28.070 --> 05:32.830
<b>in the form of interest as time progresses 
from the activation of the ability.</b>

05:37.780 --> 05:39.320
<b><i>Lost sight of him...</i></b>

05:40.910 --> 05:43.420
<b>Damn you!</b>

05:43.420 --> 05:45.260
<b>The enraged Youpi</b>

05:46.110 --> 05:50.900
<b>returned to his senses because his multiple 
eyes had caught sight of a shadowed form.</b>

05:57.590 --> 06:00.150
<b>With his right leg broken,</b>

06:00.150 --> 06:04.330
<b>Shoot unconsciously used his remaining 
leg to stand on one of his own fists.</b>

06:05.110 --> 06:08.800
<b>Despite that he had never attempted it before,</b>

06:08.800 --> 06:13.320
<b>Shoot realized that this was his ultimate technique.</b>

06:19.600 --> 06:24.710
<b>And he had no clear reason 
to cover his right eye.</b>

06:26.220 --> 06:29.580
<b>He was just enjoying the fact</b>

06:29.580 --> 06:33.970
<b>that he continued to gain strength 
while the situation deteriorated.</b>

06:43.130 --> 06:44.960
<b>Fueled by adversity itself,</b>

06:48.680 --> 06:50.450
<b>Shoot took flight.</b>

07:10.860 --> 07:13.510
<b>His tremendous speed and vigor</b>

07:13.860 --> 07:19.910
<b>succeeded in forcing Youpi to 
concentrate on defense for a few seconds.</b>

07:22.460 --> 07:23.590
<b>All in order</b>

07:24.690 --> 07:26.270
<b>to help the others.</b>

07:30.820 --> 07:33.390
<b><i>Shoot, Knuckle...</i></b>

07:39.610 --> 07:45.320
<b><i>Once we finish this, first thing we do 
is drink ourselves silly with good alcohol.</i></b>

07:46.500 --> 07:51.740
<b><i>That's the only way I can get you guys 
to let me give you a big hug.</i></b>

07:55.120 --> 07:58.650
<b>The debris cloud raised by the destruction</b>

07:58.650 --> 08:03.220
<b>was the perfect cover for Morel to expand 
his smoke aura throughout the palace</b>

08:03.220 --> 08:05.600
<b>so he could monitor the course of the battle.</b>

08:07.400 --> 08:10.170
<b>Morel's objective was the throne room.</b>

08:12.490 --> 08:15.740
<b>When Youpi destroyed the central stairway,</b>

08:17.590 --> 08:23.140
<b>Gon and Killua evaded the attack 
and changed direction.</b>

08:36.200 --> 08:37.990
<b>They planned to jump from</b>

08:37.990 --> 08:43.080
<b>the east tower's second floor to the central 
tower's third floor, where the throne room was.</b>

08:43.900 --> 08:48.230
<b>Upon hitting the ground, they passed 
Ikalgo in the courtyard as he headed</b>

08:50.670 --> 08:52.120
<b>for the elevator underground.</b>

08:54.300 --> 08:57.690
<b>His ability that let him control corpses 
like part of his own body,</b>

08:58.000 --> 09:03.380
<b>Living Dead Dolls, granted him 
the use of multiple sets of eyes,</b>

09:03.590 --> 09:06.730
<b>which had allowed him to 
dodge Dragon Dive unscratched.</b>

09:13.990 --> 09:17.630
<b>In the corner of his eye, Killua spotted</b>

09:20.520 --> 09:22.550
<b>two soldier Ants in the direction</b>

09:24.400 --> 09:26.370
<b>that Ikalgo was headed.</b>

09:36.890 --> 09:40.130
<b>In the next moment, Killua had taken off.</b>

10:25.790 --> 10:26.740
<b><i>Killua?</i></b>

10:27.310 --> 10:29.260
<b><i>Why is he heading toward the elevator?</i></b>

10:33.200 --> 10:34.990
<b><i>What am I doing?</i></b>

10:35.810 --> 10:37.130
<b><i>What's wrong with me?</i></b>

10:37.600 --> 10:41.790
<b>It was only natural that Killua would 
be surprised by his own actions.</b>

10:42.810 --> 10:44.870
<b>He was the one</b>

10:44.870 --> 10:48.500
<b>who had instructed the others 
to stick to their own tasks.</b>

10:50.190 --> 10:53.520
<b>At that point, Killua's mind completely froze.</b>

11:09.410 --> 11:14.280
<b>However, while his mind panicked,</b>

11:18.440 --> 11:21.630
<b>his body continued to move efficiently,</b>

11:22.420 --> 11:26.870
<b>keeping aura usage to a minimum,</b>

11:29.990 --> 11:33.030
<b>while swiftly and accurately</b>

11:38.550 --> 11:43.720
<b>gauging the two soldier Ants' abilities 
and movements, and halting them.</b>

11:51.620 --> 11:55.780
<b>Only Ikalgo and one other 
saw what had happened.</b>

12:21.760 --> 12:22.970
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

12:24.270 --> 12:25.510
<b><i>What have I</i></b>

12:27.690 --> 12:29.290
<b><i>done?</i></b>

13:20.100 --> 13:21.030
<b>Killua,</b>

13:23.870 --> 13:25.030
<b>I owe you one.</b>

13:28.810 --> 13:32.980
<b>After he realized what he'd done, 
a tangle of emotions</b>

13:33.490 --> 13:36.270
<b>had left Killua lost in confusion,</b>

13:36.750 --> 13:38.820
<b>until Ikalgo's words woke him.</b>

13:47.370 --> 13:50.890
<b>By the time the two Ants' remains hit the floor,</b>

13:51.860 --> 13:54.960
<b>Killua was already moving on.</b>

13:59.510 --> 14:00.740
<b><i>Flutter?</i></b>

14:03.860 --> 14:05.240
<b><i>Something's wrong.</i></b>

14:06.650 --> 14:13.520
<b>At either end of the hall leading to the 
elevator underground were the servant quarters,</b>

14:13.520 --> 14:16.600
<b>which soldier Ants currently occupied.</b>

14:18.560 --> 14:22.000
<b>Ikalgo raced past the two Ants,</b>

14:22.530 --> 14:26.010
<b>and at the moment when he reached the elevator,</b>

14:29.720 --> 14:34.670
<b>the doors at both ends opened simultaneously.</b>

14:36.000 --> 14:39.280
<b>From the doors appeared...</b>

14:47.960 --> 14:48.970
<b><i>Cheetu...</i></b>

14:51.370 --> 14:52.440
<b><i>Brovada!</i></b>

14:59.000 --> 15:01.560
<b>After seeing Flutter,</b>

15:01.560 --> 15:05.580
<b>Welfin had hidden because he'd smelled 
that something was wrong.</b>

15:08.550 --> 15:09.870
<b><i>That was too fast.</i></b>

15:11.980 --> 15:15.800
<b><i>Once they spotted the enemy, 
the two soldiers raised an alert.</i></b>

15:16.290 --> 15:18.520
<b><i>Right afterward, they were killed.</i></b>

15:18.970 --> 15:23.180
<b><i>The time between the intruder's 
return down the hallway</i></b>

15:23.790 --> 15:29.220
<b><i>and Flutter's appearance was too short!</i></b>

15:32.000 --> 15:38.070
<b><i>Which means they must have passed 
one another in the hallway.</i></b>

15:38.810 --> 15:42.250
<b><i>Then why were the soldiers killed,</i></b>

15:42.560 --> 15:45.000
<b><i>but not Flutter?</i></b>

15:46.370 --> 15:48.070
<b><i>Is Flutter on the enemy's side?</i></b>

15:48.520 --> 15:49.540
<b><i>Meaning...</i></b>

15:50.780 --> 15:51.860
<b><i>He's a traitor!</i></b>

15:53.960 --> 15:55.560
<b><i>Is he acting on his own, or...</i></b>

15:57.410 --> 15:59.140
<b><i>Is it Hagya's... Or rather...</i></b>

16:00.560 --> 16:02.670
<b><i>Leol's orders?</i></b>

16:19.500 --> 16:21.380
<b><i>This is pathetic.</i></b>

16:22.820 --> 16:25.130
<b><i>When he needed me most, I wasn't there.</i></b>

16:26.160 --> 16:28.860
<b><i>And I call myself a Royal Guard?</i></b>

16:30.600 --> 16:32.760
<b><i>I don't even know where the King is.</i></b>

16:34.420 --> 16:37.230
<b><i>And I call myself a Royal Guard?</i></b>

16:38.950 --> 16:39.680
<b><i>No.</i></b>

16:42.270 --> 16:43.970
<b><i>I am a failure!</i></b>

16:47.100 --> 16:48.760
<b><i>It's that simple...</i></b>

16:51.150 --> 16:56.390
<b>Pouf's loyalty made him both strong and weak.</b>

16:58.840 --> 17:02.960
<b>The ideals he prioritized were 
unyielding and absolute.</b>

17:12.180 --> 17:14.460
<b><i>Pouf, the former Royal Guard.</i></b>

17:14.970 --> 17:16.350
<b><i>Now, Pouf...</i></b>

17:16.350 --> 17:17.810
<b><i>Useless Pouf...</i></b>

17:18.250 --> 17:19.720
<b><i>You utter fool.</i></b>

17:20.330 --> 17:22.610
<b><i>You failure of a Royal Guard!</i></b>

17:23.330 --> 17:24.980
<b><i>Where will you go now?</i></b>

17:25.370 --> 17:27.090
<b><i>You have no idea?</i></b>

17:28.080 --> 17:30.840
<b><i>And if the King isn't there,</i></b>

17:30.840 --> 17:33.990
<b><i>then you'll be more useless 
than scum, won't you?</i></b>

17:34.910 --> 17:37.980
<b><i>No, useless Pouf...</i></b>

17:38.940 --> 17:41.310
<b><i>You just refuse to accept reality.</i></b>

17:43.770 --> 17:49.650
<b>You don't want him spending 
time with that woman!!!!</b>

17:44.460 --> 17:48.930
<b><i>You don't want him spending 
time with that woman!</i></b>

17:52.880 --> 17:56.760
<b>His emotions were directed at 
the King as well as himself.</b>

17:58.880 --> 18:02.520
<b><i>An absolute King,</i></b>

18:03.330 --> 18:05.530
<b><i>feeling concern for a lowly human...</i></b>

18:06.170 --> 18:09.470
<b><i>Visiting the room of a lowly human by choice...</i></b>

18:10.190 --> 18:11.770
<b><i>It is unforgivable!</i></b>

18:13.050 --> 18:14.200
<b><i>But...</i></b>

18:15.070 --> 18:17.180
<b><i>That's probably where the King is...</i></b>

18:20.810 --> 18:25.260
<b><i>Before I came here, I knew that much.</i></b>

18:25.910 --> 18:30.640
<b><i>I didn't fail as a Royal Guard because 
I didn't know the King's location.</i></b>

18:31.420 --> 18:35.210
<b><i>I failed because I knew where, 
and I didn't go there!</i></b>

18:36.590 --> 18:40.180
<b><i>Yes, Pouf, you traitor, lower than scum.</i></b>

18:41.180 --> 18:43.700
<b><i>You are now a mere bug!</i></b>

18:44.430 --> 18:46.760
<b><i>You can no longer expect anything of yourself.</i></b>

18:47.600 --> 18:51.790
<b><i>Nor are you allowed, then, 
to expect anything of the King!</i></b>

18:52.860 --> 18:55.280
<b><i>I can only work for the King...</i></b>

18:55.610 --> 18:59.200
<b><i>For the King... For the King... 
For the King... For the King...</i></b>

18:59.530 --> 19:02.200

19:04.090 --> 19:05.850
<b><i>For the King!</i></b>

19:07.420 --> 19:11.210
<b>Instead, his emotions, bordering on fanaticism,</b>

19:11.700 --> 19:17.990
<b>prevented him from thinking clearly in the 
seconds after he arrived in the throne room.</b>

19:23.970 --> 19:26.410
<b><i>I must go to the King.</i></b>

19:35.330 --> 19:36.480
<b>Yo.</b>

<b><i>You're gonna ignore me?!</i></b>

19:46.910 --> 19:49.660
<b><i>He goes straight to the King without a glance.</i></b>

19:50.870 --> 19:54.740
<b>Unfortunately, you've been surrounded.</b>

19:57.730 --> 19:59.000
<b>What must I do</b>

<b>to have you let me out?</b>

20:04.240 --> 20:07.260
<b>Oh, I'm not letting you out.</b>
