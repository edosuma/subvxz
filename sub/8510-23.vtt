04:27.892 --> 04:32.187

04:32.272 --> 04:37.526
Shouting won't solve anything.
The Witchblade's power is increasing.

04:37.610 --> 04:42.072

12:14.358 --> 12:17.110
See! We told you to stop the shipment!

12:17.194 --> 12:21.573
--How could you ignore the lab?!
--This is the worst possible outcome!
