12:33.929 --> 12:36.470
Jackie Rohr, FBI.
You mind if I call you D?

12:36.470 --> 12:39.387
Uh...no.
I have an arraignment.

12:39.387 --> 12:41.261
The arraignment's what I want
to talk to you about.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.053
You got a kid, Roach,
on your docket.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.095
He's an informant of mine.
He's working a decent case.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.136
He also shot a cop.

12:47.136 --> 12:49.470
Well, he allegedly
shot a cop.

12:51.303 --> 12:54.637
You want me to let him off?
Why me?

12:54.637 --> 12:56.470
Call it a professional favor.

12:56.470 --> 12:58.303
No, but why me...

12:58.303 --> 12:59.553
specifically?

12:59.553 --> 13:00.845
It's your case,
isn't it?

13:00.845 --> 13:02.637
[scoffs]

13:02.637 --> 13:04.804
Is there
a misunderstanding here?

13:04.804 --> 13:07.637
No, no, see,
I understand perfectly.

13:07.637 --> 13:09.261
You walk in here
and you think,

13:09.261 --> 13:11.720
oh, the new guy's stupid enough
to eat your bullshit.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.178
What are you,
some kind of asshole?

13:14.178 --> 13:16.970
I spent five years
with the U.S. Attorney,

13:16.970 --> 13:20.136
watching Feds cut deals
for pieces of shit like this.

13:20.136 --> 13:22.345
Take it to Guy Dan.
See what he says.

13:22.345 --> 13:25.178
Oh, well, excuse me,
Clarence Thomas.

13:25.178 --> 13:27.553
I'm sorry I gave you
the benefit of the doubt.

13:27.553 --> 13:29.345
I figured you weren't
Guy Dan's Uncle Tom,

13:29.345 --> 13:30.387
but clearly
I was mistaken.

13:30.387 --> 13:31.679
Don't worry.

13:32.970 --> 13:36.345
Next time, I won't ask.

13:37.679 --> 13:39.345
Oh, is that a threat?

13:39.345 --> 13:40.970
Threat?

13:40.970 --> 13:42.512
No.

13:42.512 --> 13:43.845
It's a "fuck you."

13:55.637 --> 14:00.011
[guard groaning]

14:01.261 --> 14:02.512
Aah!

14:02.512 --> 14:04.887
[all shouting and grunting]

14:04.887 --> 14:07.095
Hey!

14:07.095 --> 14:09.220
Hey!

14:09.220 --> 14:11.553
What the hell's fuckin'
goin' on back there?

14:11.553 --> 14:14.178
[gunshot]

14:14.178 --> 14:15.720
[tires squeal]

14:22.720 --> 14:24.303
[car horn honks]

14:30.261 --> 14:31.470
[man groaning]

14:33.929 --> 14:35.679
He saw my fucking face!

14:35.679 --> 14:36.929
What the fuck?

14:36.929 --> 14:38.804
He saw my fucking face!

14:55.762 --> 14:57.762
What the fuck are we gonna do?

14:57.762 --> 14:59.428
They saw my fucking face!

14:59.428 --> 15:01.053
Calm down.
You understand me?

15:01.053 --> 15:03.053
I don't know, man.
Let's just take their IDs,

15:03.053 --> 15:04.637
drop them off at the yard.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.345
What are you,
a fucking moron?

15:06.345 --> 15:07.804
We'll know where
their families live.

15:07.804 --> 15:09.428
I ain't hurting
someone's kids!

15:09.428 --> 15:11.804
Jesus, my kid's got
nothing to do with this.

15:11.804 --> 15:13.095
We're not gonna hurt
your goddamn kids.

15:13.095 --> 15:14.804
I'm not gonna say nothin'!

15:14.804 --> 15:17.095
-I don't know you.
-We won't say nothing.

15:17.095 --> 15:18.512
I don't know you either!

15:18.512 --> 15:19.929
Fuck!

15:21.470 --> 15:22.929
[breathing heavily]

15:26.095 --> 15:28.095
[guard] Look, I'm from
D Street in South--

15:28.095 --> 15:29.762
Nobody cares
where you're from!

15:29.762 --> 15:32.220
All's I'm saying
is I grew up with it.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.303
I'm not gonna rat
anyone out, on my life.

15:34.303 --> 15:37.136
If you were me,
would you trust you?

15:37.136 --> 15:39.762
[guard]
We'll take money, some of it.

15:39.762 --> 15:42.261
You get caught,
say we're in on it.

15:45.303 --> 15:47.220
That's not a bad idea.

15:47.220 --> 15:48.762
They saw my face.

15:48.762 --> 15:51.470
You want to worry about this
the rest of your life?

15:51.470 --> 15:53.220
It's on you.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.595
It's up to you, boss.

16:03.470 --> 16:08.053
[breathing heavily]

16:38.178 --> 16:39.512
I get one smoke?

17:10.428 --> 17:12.720
[guard]
Oh, my God!

17:12.720 --> 17:14.178
[guard sobbing]

17:18.512 --> 17:19.720
Oh, no.

17:20.887 --> 17:23.804
[guard screams]

17:23.804 --> 17:26.720
[Jackie panting]

17:30.261 --> 17:32.387
Wait, wait.
Hang on, hang on.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.428
[grunts]

17:35.428 --> 17:37.512
Okay, don't stop.
Don't stop.

17:37.512 --> 17:38.679
[laughs]

17:38.679 --> 17:40.095
Here, here. Ready?

17:41.345 --> 17:42.720
[both sigh]

17:44.095 --> 17:46.887
-[pots clang]
-Shh.

17:46.887 --> 17:50.345
[woman speaking Cantonese]

17:50.345 --> 17:52.887
What the fuck is she
ching-chonging about?

17:52.887 --> 17:54.095
She's calling you "gweilo."

17:54.095 --> 17:56.261
Gweilo? What the fuck
does that mean?

17:56.261 --> 17:58.303
Approximately,
"white devil."

17:58.303 --> 18:00.261
Ooh, she ain't wrong
about that.

18:00.261 --> 18:01.095
[both laugh]

18:07.387 --> 18:08.887
Come here, baby.

18:08.887 --> 18:10.720
[woman shouting in Cantonese]

18:10.720 --> 18:12.261
Ooh, gotta go.

18:12.261 --> 18:14.220
-[woman shouting]
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.553
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.
Take-- hey, hey.

18:17.762 --> 18:19.512
Get back! Get back!

18:19.512 --> 18:21.887
Mama, people can see you!
Stop it!

18:21.887 --> 18:25.303
[men chuckling]

18:25.303 --> 18:27.553
What the fuck are you guys
doing down here?

18:27.553 --> 18:29.220
Fuck are you doing here?

18:30.720 --> 18:32.387
[laughs]
Man.

18:32.387 --> 18:35.804
Your life's just turned out
exactly how you expected, huh?

18:35.804 --> 18:37.804
-[woman yelling in Cantonese]
-All right, all right!

18:37.804 --> 18:38.970
All right, all right,
I'm going, I'm goin'.

19:10.929 --> 19:13.428
[door creaks open]

19:21.345 --> 19:23.178
[door creaks closed]

19:25.512 --> 19:27.261
[muffled retching]

19:38.553 --> 19:40.553
Rough night?

19:40.553 --> 19:42.220
I'm sorry, Daddy.

19:42.220 --> 19:45.136
I got some sausage and peppers
left over from lunch.

19:45.136 --> 19:47.220
You want me to heat that up
for you?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.845
-[coughs]
-Ooh.

19:51.387 --> 19:53.303
Why would you say that
to me?

19:53.303 --> 19:56.887
Just be grateful that I
found you and not your mother.

20:04.261 --> 20:05.220
Fuck!

20:08.220 --> 20:09.720
[breathing heavily]

20:15.845 --> 20:17.220
I don't know how
I'm going to do it.

20:18.887 --> 20:21.345
Look my wife in the eye

20:21.345 --> 20:23.345
when she asks about
what happened today, you know?

20:25.845 --> 20:27.470
Why?

20:27.470 --> 20:29.261
You didn't do nothin'.

21:08.553 --> 21:10.679
Oh. Guns and drugs.

21:10.679 --> 21:12.345
Yeah.

21:12.345 --> 21:13.553
But a cop was shot.

21:13.553 --> 21:15.136
Oh.

21:15.136 --> 21:16.512
So this is one where
the Boston Police

21:16.512 --> 21:17.970
actually want you to win?

21:17.970 --> 21:20.053
[both laugh]

21:20.053 --> 21:22.303
Life doesn't have
to be this hard.

21:22.303 --> 21:24.261
The firm would love
to have you.

21:24.261 --> 21:26.303
Oh, but then I'd have
to spend my nights in Locke-Ober

21:26.303 --> 21:27.637
watching these old
rich people

21:27.637 --> 21:29.220
stuff their faces
full of lobster.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.095
Just like you will
Wednesday night.

21:31.095 --> 21:32.970
No, wh...

21:32.970 --> 21:34.470
you still making me
go to that, babe?

21:34.470 --> 21:36.428
Come on, I got to eat
shit all day.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.637
Now I got to eat yours too?

21:37.637 --> 21:38.804
You will take
what I give you

21:38.804 --> 21:41.387
and be glad to eat it,
Mr. Ward.

21:50.887 --> 21:52.595
Oh, is that so?

21:52.595 --> 21:54.345
That is so.

21:56.637 --> 21:57.512
Okay.

21:59.136 --> 22:00.345
Come here.

22:00.345 --> 22:01.720
Oh, God, that feels weird.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.345
Don't worry,
it's not weird.

22:03.345 --> 22:05.011
-It's working.
-[Jenny] It hurts, though.

22:05.011 --> 22:07.553
[mother] It can't be
hurting, for Christ's sake.

22:07.553 --> 22:09.095
Kid.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.679
-Come on.
-[Jenny] Is it done?

22:10.679 --> 22:12.512
[mother]
It's almost done. Almost done.

22:12.512 --> 22:14.011
[sighs]

22:14.011 --> 22:15.679
What the hell are you two
gypsies up to?

22:15.679 --> 22:17.303
We're talking about you,
asshole.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.053
What else is new?

22:19.053 --> 22:20.887
You feeling all right?

22:20.887 --> 22:23.512
Yeah. Ears are killing me.

22:24.845 --> 22:25.970
How was your night?

22:25.970 --> 22:27.470
Awful.

22:27.470 --> 22:29.011
You feel better now?

22:29.011 --> 22:30.929
Yeah, feels all right.

22:30.929 --> 22:32.220
[Jackie groans]

22:32.220 --> 22:33.512
Oh, for Christ's sake.

22:33.512 --> 22:34.637
I didn't need
to see that.

22:34.637 --> 22:36.887
What was so bad
about work?

22:36.887 --> 22:38.512
I just spent the night
running around,

22:38.512 --> 22:40.637
trying to get this informant
out of stir.

22:40.637 --> 22:42.720
Guy Dan
give you a problem?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.220
No.

22:44.220 --> 22:46.261
His affirmative action
hire.

22:46.261 --> 22:48.845
Well, what do you expect
from that?

22:53.011 --> 22:55.220
So why you look
so handsome today?

22:57.637 --> 23:00.220
Think I'm coming down
with something.

23:00.220 --> 23:02.762
Ah.

23:02.762 --> 23:06.136
Yeah, I guess something
must be going around.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.303
Bennie couldn't get
out of bed this morning.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.512
I think that's
a feminine issue.

23:10.512 --> 23:11.887
[scoffs]

23:11.887 --> 23:13.720
What?

23:13.720 --> 23:15.512
Nothing. Nothing.

23:17.095 --> 23:18.428
I hope you feel better.

23:27.220 --> 23:28.428
-Marilyn.
-Hey, Jackie.

23:30.428 --> 23:32.136
Hey.

23:32.136 --> 23:34.261
Where the fuck did you
find this kid, Ward?

23:34.261 --> 23:36.887
U.S. Attorney's,
working white collar.

23:36.887 --> 23:39.970
Junk bonds, savings and loan,
that sort of thing.

23:39.970 --> 23:42.428
-Why?
-What is a guy like that doing

23:42.428 --> 23:44.929
working at the fucking
Suffolk DA's office?

23:44.929 --> 23:47.220
He's got a notion he's going
to be the next mayor of Boston.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.845
Oh, yeah?
How's he figure that?

23:49.845 --> 23:51.470
He got money?

23:51.470 --> 23:53.053
No, he's just a Brownsville
porch monkey,

23:53.053 --> 23:55.136
but his wife's
got money.

23:55.136 --> 23:57.929
Hmm. Is she good-looking too?

23:57.929 --> 24:01.970
Honestly, how much trouble
are you about to cause me today?

24:01.970 --> 24:04.136
[blows kiss]

24:04.136 --> 24:06.553
-[door opens]
-[Rey] Clay Roach...

24:06.553 --> 24:08.553
how's that going?

24:08.553 --> 24:10.637
Oh, he'll be going
cold turkey at Walpole

24:10.637 --> 24:11.887
by the end of the week.

24:15.261 --> 24:17.261
If you had to,

24:17.261 --> 24:18.804
think you could drop him?

24:18.804 --> 24:20.762
What, are you kidding me?

24:20.762 --> 24:22.762
The BPD already
wants to lynch me.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.887
Now you want me to let
a cop-shooter walk?

24:24.887 --> 24:27.136
Well, it might be in your best
interest, considering--

24:27.136 --> 24:28.345
What does Guy Dan say?

24:28.345 --> 24:31.053
No, Guy Dan is not
in this conversation.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.178
That's why I'm here.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.345
Okay.

24:36.345 --> 24:37.720
You want it dropped?

24:37.720 --> 24:38.762
Order me to.

24:43.553 --> 24:46.303
You know, Ward,
there's a way to do this job,

24:46.303 --> 24:48.679
you could have it
for the rest of your life.

24:48.679 --> 24:50.804
Watch your kids grow up
in a good neighborhood,

24:50.804 --> 24:53.512
safe from all the shit
that we see here.

24:53.512 --> 24:55.387
But if you want to be
an idealist--

24:55.387 --> 24:57.011
I'm not having
this conversation.

25:00.637 --> 25:01.512
All right.

25:03.053 --> 25:07.345
[door opens and closes]

25:09.512 --> 25:11.136
[sirens,
police radio chatter]

25:21.220 --> 25:23.220
Anyone good?

25:23.220 --> 25:26.136
Yeah. A real tragedy.

25:26.136 --> 25:28.387
Number 99 of the year.

25:28.387 --> 25:29.720
Can I ask you
a question?

25:31.720 --> 25:33.220
In your experience,

25:33.220 --> 25:35.470
is it a rare thing,

25:35.470 --> 25:38.178
the FBI interfering
in felony cases?

25:38.178 --> 25:41.220
Is it rare? No.
But who asked?

25:41.220 --> 25:42.720
Jackie Rohr.

25:43.762 --> 25:45.929
Rohr you want to avoid.

25:45.929 --> 25:48.845
He's like the FBI's
Doug Flutie.

25:48.845 --> 25:50.887
He can walk into any cop bar
in New England

25:50.887 --> 25:52.428
and never have to buy himself
a drink.

25:52.428 --> 25:54.178
Why's that?

25:54.178 --> 25:55.720
He was on the crew
that brought down

25:55.720 --> 25:57.470
the Angiulo family
about ten years back.

25:57.470 --> 25:59.136
First guys to do it
in the country,

It's not going to happen.

Brother, come on!

39:18.553 --> 39:21.303

39:21.303 --> 39:23.512
I never asked you
for anything.

39:23.512 --> 39:24.762
-No, you haven't.
-No.

39:24.762 --> 39:26.512
No.

39:26.512 --> 39:28.887
But plenty of people
have asked on your behalf.

39:28.887 --> 39:30.220
You know what?

39:31.387 --> 39:33.303
You know I can do it.

39:33.303 --> 39:35.387
-I know you can do it.
-Exactly!

Hey, look at my life.

39:52.929 --> 39:55.261
-You think it changes anything
Jimmy?
-No, no!

39:55.261 --> 39:57.178
You think having money
changes a thing?

39:57.178 --> 39:59.845
No, but it makes it easier,
all right?

39:59.845 --> 40:01.387

the Drug Control Unit

40:30.470 --> 40:31.637
find on the premises?

40:32.970 --> 40:35.178
A .22 handgun matched

40:35.178 --> 40:37.178

from Officer Burke's shin.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.887
Suspect was apprehended near
the vicinity of the shooting.

40:47.887 --> 40:50.178
It says in your report,
detective,

40:50.178 --> 40:53.178
that suspect Roach was taken
inside the premises.

40:53.178 --> 40:56.178

happen to you out there, boy?

41:18.428 --> 41:20.387
Your Honor,
the detective said--

41:20.387 --> 41:22.845
You stripped your horns
going after cops,

41:22.845 --> 41:24.512
then took a job
working for them.

41:24.512 --> 41:26.011
Don't hand me excuses.

41:26.011 --> 41:28.470
I don't know what else
to tell you.

41:28.470 --> 41:30.345
Did I hear something
about this Roach kid

41:30.345 --> 41:31.887
being a federal
informant?

41:31.887 --> 41:33.428
He was, or is.

41:33.428 --> 41:34.845
Then you should have
let him walk.

41:37.053 --> 41:39.512
Oh, what?
You think I'm base now?

41:41.220 --> 41:43.428
-Your Honor...
-You know what, counselor?

41:43.428 --> 41:45.220
Lincoln Steffens once said,

41:45.220 --> 41:47.679
Jesus replied that he could only
save sinners, not the righteous.

41:47.679 --> 41:48.679

41:57.387 --> 41:59.053

Not tonight, Siobhan.

41:59.053 --> 42:00.720
And what the fuck
is your problem?

42:02.011 --> 42:03.720
You won't want
to hear it.

42:03.720 --> 42:05.303
You said it would happen.

42:05.303 --> 42:07.220
You said it would happen
a million fucking times.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.595
And what's that?

42:08.595 --> 42:11.553
They handed me a shit case

42:11.553 --> 42:13.720
I didn't even want:
a cop shooting.

42:13.720 --> 42:16.053
Then they don't want me
to prosecute.

42:16.053 --> 42:18.428
They want me to let the guy
who shot the cop off.

42:18.428 --> 42:21.387
I refuse. Then they put
a cop up on the stands

42:21.387 --> 42:22.720
who lies about
the whole thing.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.261
The cop shooter walks.

42:24.261 --> 42:26.553
I-I can't win.
I can't fucking win.

42:26.553 --> 42:28.637
Why didn't you just do
what they asked?

42:28.637 --> 42:30.637
Because I'm not

DeCourcy.

42:39.512 --> 42:41.095
You told me
not to take the job.

42:41.095 --> 42:42.595
Ross and Goodwin woulda made
you a better offer

42:42.595 --> 42:43.970

should be.

42:47.345 --> 42:49.387
That's not the way
things are.

42:49.387 --> 42:50.762
So why are you acting
like it is?

42:52.178 --> 42:53.762
'Cause I'm a fucking
asshole, Siobhan.

42:53.762 --> 42:55.512
-I'm a fucking asshole.
-Okay.

42:55.512 --> 42:57.261
Quoting my own argument
back to me

42:57.261 --> 42:58.679
isn't going to get you any pity.

isn't gonna get me

50:14.345 --> 50:15.887
Yeah, don't you have a wife?

50:15.887 --> 50:18.345
Unfortunately.
What's going on?

50:18.345 --> 50:20.595
Armored car job
in Revere Beach.

50:20.595 --> 50:21.887
Three missing guards.

50:21.887 --> 50:23.345
All presumed dead.

50:27.387 --> 50:29.679
If this is Murder One,
we can get a piece of it.

50:29.679 --> 50:31.095
It's a capital case.

50:31.095 --> 50:32.345
[man]
Yeah, but the Feds'll eat it.

50:34.011 --> 50:35.553
And why would we
want them to do that?

50:35.553 --> 50:37.220
It's an armored car job
in Revere.

50:37.220 --> 50:38.595
So you can lay odds
someone

50:38.595 --> 50:39.970
from Charlestown's
responsible.

50:39.970 --> 50:42.011
Which means no Boston cop

50:42.011 --> 50:44.095
wants to get involved
in a joint investigation

50:44.095 --> 50:45.720
because they know exactly
what they're going to hear

50:45.720 --> 50:47.303
out of every single witness.

50:47.303 --> 50:50.136
Like, "Fuck yourself,
I ain't seen nothing."

50:51.804 --> 50:53.053
He's not from around here.

50:54.053 --> 50:55.512
Where you from again, Ward?

50:55.512 --> 50:57.428
Brooklyn.

50:57.428 --> 50:59.136
[man]
Look, a case like this

50:59.136 --> 51:02.053
is the single worst thing
we have to deal with.

51:02.053 --> 51:04.261
So if the Feds'll eat it,
we let them.

51:04.261 --> 51:06.220
Nobody wants a part of that.

51:20.095 --> 51:21.303
How are you?

51:21.303 --> 51:23.095
-You all right?
-Yeah.

51:23.095 --> 51:24.762
Yeah, good evening.

51:43.762 --> 51:45.220
[indistinct chatter]

51:50.804 --> 51:52.261
[Jackie]
It was that night.

51:52.261 --> 51:54.303
Three of the Angiulos
were in that café

51:54.303 --> 51:55.387
when we busted 'em.

51:55.387 --> 51:57.303
But the fourth wasn't.

51:57.303 --> 52:00.136
Donato.
Donato Angiulo.

52:00.136 --> 52:02.053
But finally,
Salvie says,

52:02.053 --> 52:04.428
"Fuck it, let's just go knock
on the prick's door."

52:04.428 --> 52:06.970
We drive up to his house,
Prince Street,

52:06.970 --> 52:08.637
knock on their door.

52:08.637 --> 52:11.762
Nice old Italian lady
lets us in.

52:11.762 --> 52:13.762
And I remember

52:13.762 --> 52:15.929
staring at him
and thinking...

52:17.095 --> 52:19.637
"This motherfucker
was gonna fuck me up."

52:19.637 --> 52:22.679
And he sees this.
And he says to me,

52:22.679 --> 52:24.553
"What the fuck are you
thinking about?"

52:24.553 --> 52:26.387
And I say,

52:26.387 --> 52:28.345
"Irony abounds."

52:28.345 --> 52:30.136
Irony abounds.
That's a good line.

52:30.136 --> 52:31.720
What's that from?

52:31.720 --> 52:33.470
Arthur Bremer.

52:33.470 --> 52:34.512
He shot Wallace.

52:35.804 --> 52:37.804
Now you see
this guy here?

52:38.720 --> 52:40.512
This is DeCourcy Ward.

52:40.512 --> 52:42.637
This is the next
mayor of Boston.

52:42.637 --> 52:44.637
[man]
That'll be the day.

52:44.637 --> 52:45.845
[ice clinking]

52:45.845 --> 52:47.178
[Jackie]
Thanks for the drink.

52:49.220 --> 52:50.762
Who's that,
your priest?

52:50.762 --> 52:53.512
Yeah. Yeah, he cleans up
real good come Sunday.

52:53.512 --> 52:55.011
What can I do for you, D?

52:55.011 --> 52:57.011
You know,
you were right.

52:57.011 --> 52:58.679
We got off
on the left foot.

52:58.679 --> 53:01.428
What I should have done,
I realize now,

53:01.428 --> 53:04.970
is ask for a quid pro quo.

53:04.970 --> 53:06.720
What do you want?

53:06.720 --> 53:08.679
My way, which I got.

53:08.679 --> 53:09.929
[laughs]

53:09.929 --> 53:12.595
No, but, I mean, long-term.

53:12.595 --> 53:14.261
Honestly?

53:14.261 --> 53:17.011
I want to sail eight years
to my pension,

53:17.011 --> 53:20.220
get a job in
private security somewhere,

53:20.220 --> 53:22.679
never do another
honest day's work in my life.

53:22.679 --> 53:24.178
Okay.

53:24.178 --> 53:27.178
Well, look,
there's this case, right?

53:27.178 --> 53:29.345
Now, a case like this,
you can coast on,

53:29.345 --> 53:31.679
just like you coasted
on Angiulo in '83.

53:31.679 --> 53:33.220
[ice rattles]

53:33.220 --> 53:34.804
A couple days ago,

53:34.804 --> 53:37.220
a crew knocked over
an armored car in Revere.

53:38.220 --> 53:40.637
And the guards? Still missing.

53:42.512 --> 53:44.261
You're friends with
the federal prosecutor.

53:44.261 --> 53:45.929
What the fuck
do you need me for?

53:45.929 --> 53:48.845
I don't want this investigation
taken from me.

53:48.845 --> 53:50.387
I want to run it.

53:50.387 --> 53:52.428
And I don't want to just bury
who did it.

53:52.428 --> 53:54.595
No, I want to go
into Charlestown

53:54.595 --> 53:56.929
and I want to fuck
that place up.

53:57.887 --> 53:59.095
What about your boss?

53:59.095 --> 54:00.053
Fuck him.

54:00.053 --> 54:01.345
Fuck all of 'em.

54:01.345 --> 54:03.428
Fuck anyone else
who gets in my way.

54:06.095 --> 54:07.720
Mac.

54:07.720 --> 54:09.929
Can I get a whisky, neat?

54:09.929 --> 54:11.929
No, you see, this is good.

54:11.929 --> 54:13.679
This means you're learning.

54:16.553 --> 54:17.720
Stop.

54:22.887 --> 54:25.136
You do one.

54:25.136 --> 54:27.178
One.

54:27.178 --> 54:28.387
Whatever the takes are,
you're gettin'--

54:28.387 --> 54:29.637
Out.

54:29.637 --> 54:31.261
I don't want to hear
about the next one

54:31.261 --> 54:32.804
or some other fucking score
you got lined up.

54:32.804 --> 54:35.053
You take the money,
get straight.

54:35.053 --> 54:36.887
You understand?

54:36.887 --> 54:38.804
Uh-huh.

54:38.804 --> 54:40.136
What are you smiling at?

54:41.220 --> 54:43.512
You love it too much,
don't you?

54:43.512 --> 54:46.303
Didn't take much,
getting you to do it again.

54:46.303 --> 54:48.387
Took almost nothing.

54:48.387 --> 54:50.136
Yeah.

54:50.136 --> 54:51.345
[sniffles]

54:51.345 --> 54:53.303
-Jimmy, keep your fucking--
-Hello.

54:57.595 --> 54:58.387
[Minogue]
Frank.

55:02.220 --> 55:03.553
I wanna do another one.

55:03.553 --> 55:05.929
Another truck.

55:05.929 --> 55:07.470
After last time?

55:10.428 --> 55:12.679
You guys allergic to money
all of a sudden?

55:12.679 --> 55:15.345
But I'm not gonna work
with this guy, Frankie.

55:15.345 --> 55:16.887
What am I? What?
What am I, dog shit?

55:16.887 --> 55:18.345
-[laughs]
-Hey, shh.

55:18.345 --> 55:20.053
No, you're a fucking
wasted sperm cell.

55:20.053 --> 55:21.804
I'm a wasted fuckin' sp--
That's a good one.

55:21.804 --> 55:23.345
-Shut your fuckin' mouth.
-Know what? I've been robbin'

55:23.345 --> 55:24.136
since I was
eight years fuckin' old.

55:24.136 --> 55:25.220
What have you been doing, Tommy?

55:25.220 --> 55:26.929
And you've been getting caught.

55:26.929 --> 55:27.804
I been gettin' caught?
Hey, fuck you! Fuck you!

55:27.804 --> 55:29.095
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

55:29.095 --> 55:31.136
-[Frankie] Hey! Hey!
-Fuck you!

55:31.136 --> 55:33.345
-[Frankie] Shut the fuck up!
-[Tommy] Punk!

55:33.345 --> 55:34.804
Fuck me? I'll break
your fucking neck!

55:34.804 --> 55:36.095
Hey!

55:36.095 --> 55:37.970
-[others shushing]
-Come and get me, punk.

55:37.970 --> 55:39.720
-Hey, relax--
-Come and get me!

55:39.720 --> 55:41.470
-Get in the fuckin' car.
-[Jimmy] I'm goin'!

55:41.470 --> 55:43.679
-[Frankie] Get in the car.
-[Tommy] Frankie!

55:43.679 --> 55:45.512
-Frankie!
-I'm goin' again.

55:45.512 --> 55:47.345
I'd love to have you join me.

55:47.345 --> 55:48.887
Let me know if you can do it,
all right?

55:48.887 --> 55:51.387
[Tommy] Frank! You know
what you're doin'?

55:52.804 --> 55:54.053
Get the fuck out of the rain.

55:54.053 --> 55:55.512
This is fucking stupid.

55:55.512 --> 55:57.762
[Frankie] Turn your
fucking head around.

55:57.762 --> 56:00.011
See? It's not that complicated
what we're trying to do here.

56:00.011 --> 56:01.970
It's just a matter of how far
you're willing to go,

56:01.970 --> 56:04.178
how much shit
you're willing to eat.

56:04.178 --> 56:05.553
I can do what I got to do.

56:07.220 --> 56:08.512
Okay.

56:08.512 --> 56:09.470
So...

56:11.053 --> 56:12.595
we know that
our perpetrators

56:12.595 --> 56:16.136
are most likely a few pieces
of shit from Charlestown, right?

56:16.136 --> 56:17.762
There's more bank robbers
in Charlestown

56:17.762 --> 56:20.637
than any other square mile
in the English-speaking world.

56:20.637 --> 56:24.387
But you can't convict them,
because they don't talk.

56:24.387 --> 56:27.595
So, we use
what you've got.

56:27.595 --> 56:29.387
You're the DA.

56:29.387 --> 56:31.303
You got the number-one thing
that's going to scare

56:31.303 --> 56:34.303
every piece of shit
in this city.

56:34.303 --> 56:35.804
The grand jury.

56:35.804 --> 56:39.804
No scumbag can work
when the grand jury is on.

56:39.804 --> 56:41.762
So, what we do

56:41.762 --> 56:44.595
is we find a big case
gone cold.

56:44.595 --> 56:47.804
We round up every bank-robbing
suspect we can,

56:47.804 --> 56:51.136
and you grant them immunity
on the cold case.

56:51.136 --> 56:53.595
Then, when you get them
in front of the grand jury,

56:53.595 --> 56:56.095
you hit them with questions
about the robbery.

56:56.095 --> 56:58.136
It's jail time,
they don't want to talk to you.

56:58.136 --> 56:59.762
How'd you figure all that?

56:59.762 --> 57:03.595
D.C. law school.
Class of '68, motherfucker.

57:07.011 --> 57:08.428
It's a risky move.

57:10.053 --> 57:12.679
But given the circumstances:

57:12.679 --> 57:14.637
three dead bodies,

57:14.637 --> 57:17.095
Charlestown, black DA.

57:17.095 --> 57:19.303
People will probably
give you credit.

57:29.970 --> 57:31.261
[door opens]

58:03.261 --> 58:06.595
So I gotta ask you,
what changed your mind?

58:07.845 --> 58:10.345
About you?

58:10.345 --> 58:11.970
Beyond necessity?

58:16.261 --> 58:17.679
You'd said something.

58:17.679 --> 58:19.679
Reminded me
when I was a kid.

58:21.595 --> 58:26.178
My father,
he worked for the SCLC.

58:26.178 --> 58:27.845
He knew King.

58:27.845 --> 58:30.303
He was in Memphis
when King was shot.

58:32.887 --> 58:35.261
And when I was a kid,

58:35.261 --> 58:37.845
he'd come home
getting his head kicked in

58:37.845 --> 58:39.804
by the Bull Connors
of the world...

58:42.637 --> 58:45.011
and he'd beat the living shit
out of us.

58:47.970 --> 58:49.136
He, uh...

58:50.553 --> 58:51.720
[sighs]

58:53.970 --> 58:56.470
...caught me with a thumb
one night.

58:59.970 --> 59:01.970
You're right.
