09:30.704 --> 09:33.772
- [sighs]
Well, that's a relief.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.707
- I don't know.
I'm worried.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.976
- Why? Do you think
that lady's in danger?

09:38.045 --> 09:40.211
- No, I'm just worried about
sending Josephine

09:40.280 --> 09:42.647
to Minnesota without
a warm coat.

09:42.716 --> 09:46.117
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

09:46.186 --> 09:48.653
- And somehow the doll wasn't
in the back room anymore.

09:48.722 --> 09:52.724
- Then Milo got hit in the face
by a Japanese Punch-Bot twice.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.092
<i> [laughter]</i>

09:54.161 --> 09:57.228
- That part of the story
doesn't matter.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.030
The point is,
we got rid of the doll.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.300
Did you just lick your shirt?

10:03.503 --> 10:05.503
- No. [laughs]

10:05.572 --> 10:06.771
Okay, yes.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.773
It's all that's left
of that sweet, sweet

10:08.842 --> 10:10.442
blue sauce Hurley made.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.944
I'm not proud.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.146
- What's up, Renegades?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.048
I'm here with Hurley
who's gonna give us

10:17.117 --> 10:20.986
an exclusive first look
at his blue sauce.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.521
- More sauce?
Let me at it.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.890
- Uhp, uhp, uhp.
Me first.

10:29.529 --> 10:30.962
Yuck.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.198
If I live to be 1,000,

10:33.266 --> 10:36.768
this will still be the worst
thing I've ever tasted.

10:36.837 --> 10:37.902
- No.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.838
It can't be true.

10:45.512 --> 10:49.014
What did you do
to my precious sauce?

10:49.082 --> 10:50.849
- Okay, okay, fine.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.651
I couldn't recreate the recipe

10:52.719 --> 10:56.054
so I dumped in a bunch of blue
vitamin powder drink packets

10:56.123 --> 10:59.724
and all it made was
this blue clumpy mess.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.494
- It's her!
- My sauce!

11:02.562 --> 11:04.829
- Yeah, when creepy dolls
start coming out of sauce,

11:04.898 --> 11:07.666
that's my cue to leave.

11:07.734 --> 11:11.002
- The only
logical explanation is--

11:11.071 --> 11:12.804
there is
no logical explanation!

11:12.873 --> 11:14.606
- You said she was
in Minnesota.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.975
- She was,
but clearly, she's back.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.943
- The doll is pure evil.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.612
- We have to get rid
of this thing.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.447
<i> - You'll never get rid of me.</i>

11:22.516 --> 11:25.083
<i> I want to play with you,</i>

11:25.152 --> 11:26.418
<i> forever.</i>

11:26.486 --> 11:29.387
[screaming]

11:29.456 --> 11:31.156
- Forever?

11:31.224 --> 11:33.792
She's probably
exaggerating, right?

11:33.860 --> 11:36.795
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

11:41.301 --> 11:43.835
- We need to get rid of this
cursed doll once and for all.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.170
- You sound like the sheriff

11:45.238 --> 11:48.306
from "Spooky Doll 5:
The Hauntening."

11:48.375 --> 11:50.041
- This isn't a movie,
this is real life

11:50.110 --> 11:51.943
and the hauntening stops here.

11:52.012 --> 11:55.714
<i> - That's what you think, Milo.</i>

11:55.782 --> 11:58.116
- [screams] It knows my name.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.518
- That's awesome
and terrifying.

12:00.587 --> 12:01.853
[screams]

12:01.922 --> 12:04.956
- [screams]
- [screams]

12:09.463 --> 12:11.162
- We need to get rid of
Josephine in a way

12:11.231 --> 12:13.364
that completely destroys her.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.033
- Let's throw her
in the pizza oven.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.035
- Yeah, I burn stuff in there
all the time.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.339
- Well, I guess
this is goodbye.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.907
Maybe we should say
a few words?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.476
- Oh, I have a few words.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.045
Goodbye.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.281
- Thank you, Milo.
I'll speak next.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.752
Josephine, in our short time
together, you taught me

12:33.820 --> 12:35.286
the true meaning of fear.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.488
We'll never forget you,

12:36.556 --> 12:37.856
mostly because
you'll haunt our dreams

12:37.924 --> 12:39.958
for the rest of our lives.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.159
I believe Abraham Lincoln
once said--

12:41.228 --> 12:43.027
- Great speech.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.063
Let's get burning.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.167
[bell dings]

12:53.106 --> 12:55.440
Whoa. Look at her.

12:55.509 --> 12:57.175
She is not
coming back from that.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.043
- Actually this is
a calzone I forgot

12:59.112 --> 13:01.446
I put in the oven yesterday.

13:01.515 --> 13:02.947
I told you,
I burn a lot of stuff.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.083
- Yeah, we believed you.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.554
- Ah, here she is.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.391
Oh, here she was.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.660
- She won't need a coat
where she is now.

13:15.729 --> 13:18.163
- Now that we've permanently
destroyed the haunted soul

13:18.231 --> 13:20.465
of that forsaken, cursed,
porcelain plaything

13:20.534 --> 13:22.100
it's sauce time.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.536
- Let's crack the sauce code
once and for all.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.437
[phones chiming]

13:27.541 --> 13:30.008
- Um, Josephine
just followed me.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.309
- Me too.
- Same.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.645
- Look at you guys
staring at your phones.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.080
This is why I'm on
a social media cleanse.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.150
I'm not gonna be a puppet
to technology.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.618
- We're not looking at
pictures of someone's

13:40.687 --> 13:41.820
avocado toast, Ruby.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.021
We just got DM'ed

13:43.089 --> 13:45.390
from beyond the grave.
[phone chimes]

13:45.458 --> 13:47.659
- Now she sent a video.
- I got it, too.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.228
- Oh, let's watch it.
Let's watch it.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.863
- No, no.
Under no circumstances

13:51.932 --> 13:54.232
should we watch the video.
- Too late, watching it.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.134
- Have we learned nothing?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.837
<i> - You can't get rid of me.</i>

13:58.905 --> 14:02.473
<i> And now I'm coming to get you.</i>

14:05.212 --> 14:06.377
- Maybe the message got cut off

14:06.446 --> 14:07.912
before we could hear
the whole thing.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.648
Maybe Josephine
was going to say,

14:10.717 --> 14:13.551
"I'm coming to get you--

14:13.620 --> 14:14.586
a gift!"

14:14.654 --> 14:17.455
Or a delicious snack.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.357
- Here, I brought some
horror movie props

14:19.426 --> 14:21.226
from my personal collection.
Maybe there's something

14:21.294 --> 14:23.661
in here that can
help protect us.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.931
Shield of protection.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.401
Amulet of protection.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.471
- Ooh, I'll take this
cape of protection.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.340
- Actually,
that's just a regular cape.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.075
I brought it 'cause
it looks good with my outfit.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.010
<i> [laughter]</i>

14:39.079 --> 14:42.647
- Oh, wow, you're right.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.582
One time my friend, Margo,
from back home

14:44.651 --> 14:46.517
had a cape she thought
made her invisible.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.219
We didn't have the heart
to tell her we could

14:48.288 --> 14:50.755
all see her picking her nose
every morning on the bus.

14:50.824 --> 14:53.324
[phone rings]

14:53.393 --> 14:56.027
- It's Josephine.
Josephine's calling me.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.896
- Oh, answer it, answer it,
answer it.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.597
- No, under no circumstances--

14:59.666 --> 15:02.567
- Too late, answered it.
Hey, girl, hey.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.203
<i> - You didn't want to</i>
<i> play with me.</i>

15:05.272 --> 15:08.573
<i> So now I'm going to</i>
<i> make you pay.</i>

15:08.642 --> 15:10.975
- Okay, sure.
Can I give you cash?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.411
<i> - Not that kind of pay.</i>

15:13.480 --> 15:15.647
<i> I'm talking revenge.</i>

15:16.750 --> 15:20.218
- Got it.
<i> - I'm going to get you all.</i>

<i> [dog barks]</i>

15:22.289 --> 15:25.423
<i> Uh, gotta go.</i>
[phone clicks]

15:25.492 --> 15:27.625
- Well, that was enigmatic.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.727
- That dog bark,
I've heard it before.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.731
Oh, it sounded like the dog
from Ren's...

15:33.800 --> 15:36.067
enigmatic pants video.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.669
Am I using that word right?

15:37.737 --> 15:40.338
- You are not.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.473
- You think Ren
is behind all this?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.708
- Well,
let's pull up her channel.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.314
<i> - [screams] It knows my name.</i>

15:49.382 --> 15:52.550
<i> - That's awesome</i>
<i> and terrifying. [screams]</i>

15:52.619 --> 15:55.286
- I can't believe this.
<i> - [screams]</i>

15:55.355 --> 15:58.523
<i> - [screams]</i>
<i> - [screams]</i>

15:59.125 --> 16:00.191
- Ren had
a camera hidden inside

16:00.260 --> 16:02.093
Josephine this whole time?

16:02.162 --> 16:04.262
- I knew there was
a logical explanation.

16:04.331 --> 16:05.430
- You think she's doing this

16:05.498 --> 16:07.231
because we're
not following her?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.833
- I told her to step up
her content,

16:08.902 --> 16:10.368
but this is too far.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.970
- Why am I a part of this?

16:12.038 --> 16:13.638
I didn't do anything to Ren.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.341
I mean, sure,
she told me she was mad

16:16.409 --> 16:17.809
because none of us
follow her online.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.677
And she swore
she'd teach us all a lesson,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.713
but then I told her,
"I dare you."

16:21.781 --> 16:25.950
And then she was like,
"Prepare to be scared."

16:26.019 --> 16:27.185
Wait a second, do you think

16:27.253 --> 16:29.754
that's connected
to all of this?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.656
- Yeah, maybe.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.258
- We're not gonna let Ren
get away with this.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.560
We're gonna get revenge.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.896
- Just like in "Spooky Doll 9:
The Revengening."

16:38.965 --> 16:42.033
Except we won't throw a little
girl into an active volcano,

16:42.102 --> 16:44.268
but yeah,
the getting revenge part.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.672
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

16:51.945 --> 16:54.779
- I can't believe Ren posted
all those videos of us.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.948
Usually her posts get
like five views.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.449
Ours all had hundreds.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.252
- Oh, that was me.
I couldn't stop watching them.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.620
They're really funny.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.323
My social media cleanse
is definitely over.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.158
- Hey-yo! Check it out.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.193
While you guys were
getting stuff for the revenge,

17:09.262 --> 17:10.328
I finished making my sauce.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.829
Turned out great.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.198
- We were able to use
the sauce stain from my shirt

17:14.267 --> 17:16.734
to reverse engineer
the exact recipe.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.170
- That's genius.
- It was Darby's idea.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.072
- We figured.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.541
Why is it here? Can't you just
keep it at your work?

17:23.610 --> 17:26.577
- Why? I spend more time here
than at work.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.980
I'm gonna keep this sauce
where I can see it.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.948
- And where I can eat it.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.885
<i> [laughter]</i>

17:35.622 --> 17:36.954
- Congrats on
figuring out the recipe.

Now, why don't you help us
set up our revenge on Ren.

17:39.225 --> 17:42.493
- I can't wait to see the look
on her little, cute,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.396

18:03.817 --> 18:05.450
- We're a little freaked
because of that doll

18:05.518 --> 18:07.118
that's been terrorizing us.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.454
- She said
she was coming to get us

18:09.522 --> 18:12.457
and we're worried
we're going to be got.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.328
oh, she couldn't even
come in to work today.

18:17.397 --> 18:21.365
- Wow, you guys are really that
scared of a little doll, huh?

18:21.434 --> 18:24.102
- Yeah, I mean, I need to get
my lunch from the back room,

18:24.170 --> 18:26.070
but--[shudders]

18:26.139 --> 18:28.906
I'm way too scared
to even go back there.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.486

[laughs]

18:45.425 --> 18:48.526
- Take a little something
out of the backpack.

18:48.595 --> 18:51.529

19:41.714 --> 19:43.581
[both]
No!

19:43.650 --> 19:46.884
My sauce is ruined.

19:46.953 --> 19:50.855
- Ah, this is a huge loss
for the sauce boss.

19:50.924 --> 19:53.457
- That was a little
more extreme than expected.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.560
- Wait, this is you guys?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.261
That's what you call fun?

19:57.330 --> 20:00.965
Scaring a cute, sweet,
adorable, precious little girl?

20:01.034 --> 20:03.634
- Truthfully? We thought it was
gonna be more fun than that.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.169
- And much less messy.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.805
- It would've been easier
if you had just

20:07.874 --> 20:09.840
followed me in the first place.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.143
- Yeah,
I'm gonna do that right now.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.411
- Good call.

20:13.479 --> 20:16.914

20:16.983 --> 20:19.717
- I'm Scared Kid.
I'm Scared Kid.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.620
- Congratulations, I think?

20:22.689 --> 20:25.723
- That video of you guys
scaring me went super viral

20:25.792 --> 20:28.893
and now the internet
is calling me Scared Kid.

20:28.962 --> 20:31.028
- And you're happy about this?
- Yeah.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.864
I've got more followers now
than String Cheese Uncle

20:33.933 --> 20:35.666
and people especially love
the videos

20:35.735 --> 20:38.336
of you freaking out
and acting like babies.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.770
- Glad we could help.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.673
- Now as long as I keep posting
new content, I--

20:42.742 --> 20:44.275
Jump scare!
- [screams]

20:46.312 --> 20:47.345
- Gotcha.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.615
My Renegades are
gonna love this.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.917
- Well, it looks like
everything worked out.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.686
Ren got internet fame
at our expense,

20:55.755 --> 20:58.055
a doll wasn't really
trying to kill us,

20:58.124 --> 20:59.790
and Hurley's about to start
his own business.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.393
- [chuckles] Yeah.
That's not happening.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.796
I guess everybody who watched
Ren's video saw my blue sauce

21:05.865 --> 21:08.199
and a bunch of them
stole the idea.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.900
- I'm okay with that.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.770
I think a went a little
overboard with the sauce.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.038
- When'd you realize that?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.906
- Actually, it's when
my tongue turned blue.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.577
- I don't see anything.

21:19.646 --> 21:20.945
- Ooh, a delivery.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.951
Thank you.
- This was a crazy week,

21:27.020 --> 21:30.054
but I think I'm officially
over my fear of dolls.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.790
[screams] Dolls.

21:32.859 --> 21:36.494
Maybe I'm not 100% over it.

21:36.562 --> 21:37.862
Don't tell me this is
the plot of

21:37.930 --> 21:40.031
"Spooky Doll 13:
The Multiplyening."

21:40.099 --> 21:42.166
- That won't be released
until next year.

21:42.235 --> 21:43.768
These are to sell.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.903
There's a huge demand
because of Ren's video.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.576
- They puke sludge now.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.014
See?
