00:34.857 --> 00:36.960
You can't do this.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.480
Do you know what I hate?
More than the mud...

00:43.520 --> 00:46.520
the flies, the bloody Boche?

00:46.560 --> 00:48.560
It's a coward.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.800
And frankly,
you're not worth the paperwork.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.840
Please.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.680
Have you not left yet?

01:10.640 --> 01:12.640
I don't think I can go today.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.705
- Dad, you always do this.
- There is a lot to do here.

01:16.072 --> 01:17.915
The Ashworth wedding reception
for one.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.347
You don't think I can cope with that?

01:19.371 --> 01:22.080
- Of course you can.
- Well, then, it's settled.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.000
Come on. You promised Peggy
you'd giver her a hand.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.800
Besides, when was the last time
you took a day off?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Stop worrying.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.040
And everything will be fine.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.080
Is the car ready, Wilfred?

01:37.120 --> 01:39.120
On its way, ma'am.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.160
Not working today, Mr. Garland?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.133
I have the day off.

01:43.158 --> 01:45.719
It's almost as if the place runs
itself without you.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Do be careful out there.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.720
We've had a bit of a problem
sourcing geese.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.760
So we're doing truffled chicken
livers instead.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.800
How much of a difference is there?

02:35.840 --> 02:37.840
Mr. Klein?

02:37.880 --> 02:39.880
Care to share your wisdom?

02:41.680 --> 02:43.680
Max.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.920
Different weight, different texture.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.280
But they'll be too busy stuffing
their faces to even notice.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.000
So either we tell Lord and Lady
Ashworth that our five-star service

02:54.040 --> 02:56.040
doesn't include their entree or...

02:56.080 --> 02:58.080
we lie to protect our reputation.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.120
There you go, Chef.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.480
Contact came through
at the last minute.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.120
Geese it is, then. Charlie! Andy!

03:05.160 --> 03:07.160
Any chance of some lunch, Chef?

03:07.200 --> 03:09.200
Don't they feed you in the army?

03:09.240 --> 03:11.720
Where did you get them?
Best you don't know.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.880
I do love a wedding.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.000
They've insisted on a guest singer
for the first dance.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.040
The buggers.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.240
Is your Lordship coming today?

03:31.280 --> 03:33.880
The air force has had them flying
for two days solid.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.320
I'm not sure he even made the
wedding ceremony.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.680
Toby's due to step in as best man
just in case.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.720
You and him all hearts and flowers.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.760
I take it back.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.800
I was wrong.

03:44.840 --> 03:47.560
Sorry, can I have everyone's
attention, please?

03:47.600 --> 03:52.240
It is now 15 minutes to three
on Saturday, September 7th.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.280
A day that will go down in history

03:54.320 --> 03:57.160
because Miss. Betsey Day
just admitted

03:57.200 --> 03:59.200
she was wrong about something.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.160
Miss. Garland, that's the cars pulling
up now.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.200
May I help you?

04:28.240 --> 04:30.760
Welcome to The Halcyon.
Thank you very much.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
This way, please. Hello.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.440
Hello.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.560
Lord and Lady Ashworth's daughter
was wed this afternoon.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.360
The groom serves
in the Grenadier Guards.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.160
Married one day, back on the front
line the next.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.200
That's some life, Ray.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.880
How long will you
be staying with us, Lord Hamilton?

04:53.920 --> 04:56.520
Flight Command
has enforced a 24-hour break.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.800
Did you make the wedding?

05:02.840 --> 05:05.160
I arrived as they were exchanging
vows.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.600
- You look tired.
- No, I'm fine.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.680
Have you written your best-man
speech?

05:12.720 --> 05:14.720
I'll wing it.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.760
That's a terrible idea.

05:23.440 --> 05:26.080
Your Lordship, there is a lady here
to see you.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.120
A Mrs. Celina Ra...

05:28.160 --> 05:30.160
Radimsky.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.200
Stan's widow.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.440
I haven't seen the Ashworths since
your father's funeral.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.880
I used to think Margaret was one of
my closest friends.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.800
Would you like me to accompany you to
the reception?

05:44.840 --> 05:47.600
Actually I thought
I might invite Mr. D'Aberville.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.640
Is that wise?

05:50.680 --> 05:53.240
Everyone wants me
to be frozen in grief.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.480
He's a gentleman.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.640
He's my friend.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.680
And he makes me laugh.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.720
Is that so bad?

06:03.760 --> 06:06.720
I'll tell Miss. Garland
we need an extra place set.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.760
There's no need for you to mope.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.800
I've heard that...

06:10.840 --> 06:14.640
apparently, the Buchanan girl
is keen to make your acquaintance.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.680
Mother, please, no.

06:16.720 --> 06:18.720
I can't bear to see you on your own.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.640
You're so awkward around girls.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.800
Teresa's great fun.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.600
I feel sure that you two are going
to hit it off.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.360
Almost got it.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.440
Try now.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.200
Thank you.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.880
Jim had a whole list of things to do
before he went off, but... you know.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.960
Sorry.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.640
My daddy is a soldier.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.680
So is my brother.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.720
Daddy is up north, but Billy is...

07:01.760 --> 07:03.560
um...

07:03.600 --> 07:05.600
He's at the barracks in Hyde Park.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.640
That's right. Yes.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.680
I don't miss him. He's annoying.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.400
Mr. Garland,
this is my neighbour Ada.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.440
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

07:14.480 --> 07:17.840
I'm just nipping out to get
Mr. Garland to the tube station.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.040
Can't I go, too?

07:21.080 --> 07:25.520
Go on, Dora, show Ada and Mr. Garland
how smart you are.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.560
What do we do when we hear a siren?

07:30.840 --> 07:32.640
Very good.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.680
She'll stay like that for ages.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
Goodbye.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.760
Won't be long. Have you heard from
your Jim recently?

07:39.800 --> 07:41.800
Got a letter this morning, Ada.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.800
Sorry, I forgot.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.840
I love you, dumpling.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.880
I'm not a dumpling.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.520
Stanislav's grandfather
gave it to him.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.560
For luck.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
For all the good that did, but...

08:11.720 --> 08:13.840
he would have wanted you
to have it.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.280
Mrs. Radimsky, you and your family
will be looked after.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
It's not charity.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.480
When one of us is gone, the others
help those left behind.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.520
He's not gone.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.080
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Radimsky, I...
- He's not gone.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.120
He is dead.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.919
He is dead

08:37.960 --> 08:39.960
and not coming back.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.120
And our children...

08:43.159 --> 08:45.160
I can't tell them.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
How could he do this?

08:48.800 --> 08:50.800
He was fighting for his country.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.840
What about us?

08:52.880 --> 08:54.880
We're the ones he left behind.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.920
I don't know what to do.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.760
I don't know how to go on.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.480
Well, Mummy insisted on getting me
an Irish hunter.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.160
But Daddy wanted to get me
a Darley Arabian.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.320
I mean, honestly, it's like
sometimes

09:46.360 --> 09:48.680
he doesn't even remember there's a
war on.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.320
Excuse me, may I get you and your
friend a drink?

09:51.360 --> 09:53.360
Yes, something strong.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.080
You should come with me sometime.
You simply must see the estate.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.120
Right. Yes.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.160
- Of course.
- Wonderful.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.000
- I'll have Daddy arrange it.
- Mr. Hamilton, your brother has arrived.

10:10.400 --> 10:14.160
My apologies, Lady Teresa.
We'll continue this later.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.160
He is such a dish.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.680
Mother has decided to pair me up with
Lady Teresa

10:23.720 --> 10:26.040
so just pretend we have something to
discuss.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.080
How about this?

10:28.120 --> 10:30.120
Yesterday I was hit.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.160
I didn't even realise it at first.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.000
Leaking fuel all over
the Kent Downs.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.040
She starts pitching.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.080
Dropping like a stone and...

10:39.120 --> 10:41.120
I tried to...

10:41.167 --> 10:43.688
pull up, but... she's not responding.

10:43.713 --> 10:44.824
Jesus Christ, Freddie...

10:44.849 --> 10:47.680
At the last moment I just caught
some wind.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.080
Just enough.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.120
And all I can think about is Emma.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.400
What happens if one day

10:56.440 --> 10:58.440
someone comes with news

10:58.480 --> 11:00.480
that I just didn't make it?

11:00.520 --> 11:01.715
She knows the risks.

11:01.739 --> 11:03.677
She doesn't.
She doesn't. Not really.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.957
Not what happens to those left behind.

11:05.982 --> 11:06.982
It's Emma.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.440
- She'll stay by your side, no matter what.
- I can't put her through that.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.400
Maybe it's better to end it now.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.520
You can't stop her loving you.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.440
I don't know.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.480
Maybe I can.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.520
Maybe I have to.

11:31.512 --> 11:33.512
Fortune teller.

11:33.552 --> 11:35.005
What is the bird for?

11:35.052 --> 11:37.052
Tells her what to say.

11:37.092 --> 11:39.172
Of course it does. You have never...?

11:39.212 --> 11:41.212
No, course not.

11:41.252 --> 11:43.252
Maybe once.

11:43.292 --> 11:45.292
When I was 16.

11:45.332 --> 11:47.332
- And?
- No!

11:49.572 --> 11:51.692
Can't bring it up
and then not tell me.

11:52.772 --> 11:54.772
She told me

11:54.812 --> 11:56.812
I was secretly adopted,

11:56.852 --> 11:58.852
that my real family are royalty

11:58.892 --> 12:01.692
and that one day my heritage
would be discovered.

12:01.732 --> 12:03.732
Did you believe her?

12:03.772 --> 12:06.572
Richard, I was 16, not stupid.

12:07.972 --> 12:09.972
I suppose it's a nice idea...

12:10.972 --> 12:12.972
that none of this is real.

12:13.012 --> 12:16.412
And one day you'll wake up
and everything will be different.

12:17.772 --> 12:19.772
Do you mind waiting a few minutes?

12:19.812 --> 12:22.212
Dora's birthday this week
and I don't know

12:22.252 --> 12:25.052
when I'll get a chance to pick her
something up. Of course.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.012
Unless you've got to get straight
back. I know there's a wedding.

12:28.052 --> 12:30.052
Emma can handle it.

12:30.092 --> 12:32.092
I'll just be a minute then.

12:48.772 --> 12:50.212
Sam?

12:50.252 --> 12:52.252
Sam!

12:55.572 --> 12:57.572
I know. I know.

12:57.612 --> 12:59.612
You didn't mean to run.

12:59.652 --> 13:02.932
You were scared.
I couldn't let him do that.

13:06.572 --> 13:08.572
I'm sorry. Were you talking to me?

13:09.412 --> 13:11.412
Sam Green?

13:11.452 --> 13:14.532
I'm afraid you must have me confused
with someone else.

13:15.612 --> 13:18.652
No, no, Sam, it's me.

13:19.652 --> 13:21.652
As I said, you have me confused.

13:21.692 --> 13:23.692
Why don't you move along, friend?

13:24.612 --> 13:26.612
Sorry, Richard.

13:26.652 --> 13:28.932
I could use a second opinion.
Of course.

13:29.812 --> 13:31.812
Who's that?

13:31.852 --> 13:33.852
I have no idea.

13:46.612 --> 13:48.932
There's a wedding reception
downstairs.

13:48.972 --> 13:52.132
I wondered if you might
accompany me.

13:53.372 --> 13:55.772
I don't think
that would be a good idea.

13:57.132 --> 13:59.532
There will be a lot of eyes on you
down there.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.572
I'm only trying to protect you.

14:01.612 --> 14:03.612
Yes, of course.

14:03.652 --> 14:05.652
Please, I...

14:05.692 --> 14:07.692
interrupted your day.

14:11.492 --> 14:13.492
You know...

14:14.452 --> 14:17.252
people will just say
that I'm after your money.

14:18.972 --> 14:20.972
Turns out I am rather rich.

14:23.972 --> 14:26.172
In that case,
I'd better go and change.

14:34.412 --> 14:36.412
Toby!

14:38.172 --> 14:40.172
Hello!

14:43.292 --> 14:45.292
- Mr. Hamilton...
- Shh.

14:53.732 --> 14:55.732
Toby?

14:55.772 --> 14:57.772
Stop.

15:21.012 --> 15:23.012
So, what is going on?

15:23.052 --> 15:25.652
- I'm working, Chef.
- It's just the past week...

15:25.692 --> 15:29.172
I would appreciate it if I could
concentrate, Chef. Thank you.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.252
Didn't you use to have a picture of
your family around here?

15:34.252 --> 15:36.252
Come on, boys! Let's go.

15:36.292 --> 15:38.292
As quick as you like.

15:42.932 --> 15:44.932
Is it true...

15:44.972 --> 15:48.492
what Emma said... that you'd only had
one day off in three years?

15:49.332 --> 15:51.332
She's exaggerating.

15:51.372 --> 15:54.692
It's more like... three days off.

15:56.572 --> 15:59.292
You've been putting in the hours,
too, recently.

15:59.332 --> 16:01.332
We need the money.

16:01.372 --> 16:03.812
And work can be a good place to hide.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.172
I envy Emma's generation.

16:09.212 --> 16:11.892
They've got so many
more choices now.

16:13.052 --> 16:16.212
- Obviously...
- War excepted, of course, yes.

16:16.252 --> 16:19.172
When I was her age,
I'd already had Billy.

16:20.172 --> 16:22.772
My world was no bigger
than these few streets.

16:22.812 --> 16:25.492
Were you... happy?

16:28.972 --> 16:30.972
I think so.

16:31.932 --> 16:34.572
Sometimes it felt like...

16:36.172 --> 16:38.172
just a quiet panic.

16:39.572 --> 16:41.572
This is my life.

16:41.612 --> 16:43.612
This is it.

16:44.372 --> 16:47.892
Even now I have moments where I look
at the kids and I just feel...

16:50.052 --> 16:52.052
Hey.

16:55.172 --> 16:57.692
I dunno where that came from.
I'm sorry.

16:59.812 --> 17:01.812
Don't be.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.612
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:27.652 --> 17:29.652
put your hands together

17:29.692 --> 17:32.452
for The Air Raid Rag.

17:33.332 --> 17:36.332
- You know the drill, Mr. Feldman.
- To help any guests who wish to go

17:36.372 --> 17:38.652
- down to the shelter.
- Which we strongly advise.

17:38.692 --> 17:41.612
- What about the wedding party?
- The restaurant is ready.

17:41.652 --> 17:44.252
We carry on as normal
as per the bride's family's wishes.

17:44.292 --> 17:46.612
Hey, the staff don't get to go down
to the shelter?

17:46.652 --> 17:49.492
- Any member can go down if they wish.
- Which means keep working.

17:49.532 --> 17:52.532
- What is your point, Mr. O'Hara?
- I think you should get to the shelter.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.492
Do you know The Boy Who Cried Wolf?
If we disrupted social events

17:55.532 --> 17:57.372
at every siren,
we'd go out of business.

17:57.412 --> 17:59.412
I also remember how the story ends.

17:59.452 --> 18:03.132
The wolves finally show up
and they tear the village apart.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.300
This way, please, sir, madam.

18:31.340 --> 18:33.340
Thank you. All be over soon.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.420
The noise.
How many planes are there?

18:36.460 --> 18:38.460
I've just been up on the roof.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.500
It's not good, not good at all.

18:43.260 --> 18:45.260
There's nothing to be done, sir.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.300
Excuse me.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.780
Lady Ashworth, we need to move the
wedding party into the shelter.

18:56.820 --> 18:58.860
- Absolutely not.
- This isn't a union

18:58.900 --> 19:01.060
that can be celebrated in a
basement.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.381
- Even your father would understand that.
- Lady Hamilton,

19:03.406 --> 19:05.764
there are hundreds of German planes
over London.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.620
I will not put my staff or your
guests in danger.

19:10.780 --> 19:12.780
Well, I suppose...

19:12.820 --> 19:14.820
if there are hundreds of them.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.820
Margaret?

19:20.500 --> 19:23.020
I told his Lordship
we should go to the Savoy.

19:23.060 --> 19:25.900
But he had
some misguided idea of loyalty.

19:30.580 --> 19:34.100
- I need to get home, to Dora.
- Ada will have got her somewhere safe.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.140
Peggy.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
Come on!

20:01.076 --> 20:02.920
They told me to stay put.

20:02.944 --> 20:04.910
They won't
be scrambling any more fighters,

20:04.935 --> 20:06.676
- it's too late for that.
- I can't do nothing.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.300
- You don't have a choice.
- Boys!

20:10.300 --> 20:12.780
What do you know about
this Mr. D'Aberville?

20:12.820 --> 20:14.820
Well, I wasn't sure at first, but...

20:14.860 --> 20:17.980
I'm starting to think he might really
care about Mother.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.900
You're too soft.

20:20.940 --> 20:23.060
Not everything is simple, Freddie.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.900
Don't worry. We'll be all right.

20:33.660 --> 20:35.660
All right, come on, let's go.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.420
We'll set up as quick as we can,
Miss. Garland.

20:48.445 --> 20:49.014
Thank you.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.340
Most of the guests
are in the shelter now

20:51.380 --> 20:53.180
and the wedding party is on the move.

20:53.220 --> 20:55.340
I asked Tom
to do a sweep of the floors.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.380
Concentrate, keep working!

20:57.420 --> 20:59.420
I want everybody downstairs.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.460
No.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.820
I've not finished the main course.
And the cake still needs icing.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.380
It's fine, I will stay.
I'll finish the work.

21:07.420 --> 21:09.420
Make that two of us.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.860
We'll get it done. So, the rest
of you, away down the shelter.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.620
Now. Go on. Let's go. Go, Chef, now.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.380
We apologise for the inconvenience.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.420
Hotel guests this way.

21:40.420 --> 21:44.140
Rest assured, you will still be
receiving five-star treatment.

21:44.180 --> 21:46.180
Wedding party this way.

21:46.220 --> 21:48.220
Could be worse, madam.

21:48.260 --> 21:50.260
You could be in a public shelter.

22:09.300 --> 22:11.300
Don't worry, Sam.

22:11.340 --> 22:13.340
She'll hold.

22:13.380 --> 22:16.500
I was on the work detail
that helped reinforce this one.

22:16.540 --> 22:18.540
What about you?

22:19.380 --> 22:21.580
What have you been doing with
yourself?

22:22.700 --> 22:24.700
I'm a manager...

22:26.140 --> 22:28.140
in a hotel.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.180
Right.

22:30.220 --> 22:32.580
Things worked out all right for you,
then.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.620
Nice job.

22:35.660 --> 22:37.660
Nice suit.

22:37.700 --> 22:39.700
Nice woman.

22:41.380 --> 22:43.380
You ever think about him?

22:48.500 --> 22:50.500
I do.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.300
All the time.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.100
We agreed if we ever met...

22:57.140 --> 22:59.140
I know what we agreed, Sam.

22:59.180 --> 23:01.180
It's Garland.

23:01.220 --> 23:03.220
Richard Garland.

23:04.900 --> 23:08.060
- And if it hadn't been for me...
- I know, no, I know.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.860
But what kind of a life have I got?

23:14.100 --> 23:16.100
I never got to go home.

23:16.140 --> 23:18.740
Couldn't find a decent job.
I've got nothing.

23:18.780 --> 23:20.780
It's not fair, is it, Sam?

23:20.820 --> 23:22.940
You need to help me.
I deserve better.

23:30.260 --> 23:32.260
Peggy. Peggy!

23:32.300 --> 23:35.060
I can't leave Dora!
Not with all this going on.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.500
- It isn't safe to go out.
- What if it was Emma?

23:37.540 --> 23:39.540
Would you just sit here?

23:39.580 --> 23:41.580
Wait and see? Hope for the best?

23:41.620 --> 23:43.620
Let me go for you.

23:43.660 --> 23:46.940
I can't stop you going with mem
but I won't let you go for me.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.700
You were pretty quick
to volunteer to stay up.

23:53.740 --> 23:55.740
I have a job to do.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.780
No.

24:00.820 --> 24:03.420
I have a job to do.
You have a wife and children.

24:03.460 --> 24:05.460
Get yourself down the shelter now.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.780
I'm not asking. Go!

24:12.980 --> 24:14.980
Go!

24:15.020 --> 24:17.020
Or does it not matter any more?

24:17.060 --> 24:19.780
- Don't do that, Chef.
- You don't talk about them any more.

24:19.820 --> 24:21.708
- You used to talk about them.
- Chef!

24:21.732 --> 24:23.224
Today's the day, isn't it?

24:23.260 --> 24:25.700
I remember you talking about it.
September 7th,

24:25.740 --> 24:27.740
your daughter's birthday.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.020
I think you've given up
on your family.

24:32.060 --> 24:34.580
I think you don't care!

24:37.700 --> 24:39.700
No, no.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.740
No.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.780
Easy.

24:43.820 --> 24:45.820
Easy! Easy.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.860
It's all right, it's all right.

24:47.900 --> 24:49.900
It's all right.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.900
It's bloody ridiculous.

25:04.940 --> 25:08.420
All these folk pretending like
nothing is wrong.

25:08.460 --> 25:11.780
Do you know where the phrase "The
show must go on" comes from?

25:12.780 --> 25:14.780
The circus.

25:14.820 --> 25:18.140
If an animal got loose or...
a trapeze artist took a tumble,

25:18.180 --> 25:20.460
the ringmaster
would keep things going

25:20.500 --> 25:22.500
so the crowd wouldn't panic.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.940
Argh!

26:14.540 --> 26:16.540
Sam.

26:16.580 --> 26:18.580
What's gonna happen to us?

26:19.500 --> 26:22.020
We'll be thought of
as missing in action.

26:22.060 --> 26:24.060
At best, considered dead.

26:24.100 --> 26:26.100
At worst,

26:26.140 --> 26:28.140
deserters or...

26:33.460 --> 26:35.580
Either way,
we need to find a way back.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.700
Fresh start.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.740
New names.

26:40.780 --> 26:42.780
New life.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.540
And pray that this thing
doesn't follow us home.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.100
Come on. Come on.

27:01.940 --> 27:03.940
Richard!

27:06.740 --> 27:08.740
Richard!

27:10.540 --> 27:12.540
Are you all right?

27:23.140 --> 27:25.140
All right?

27:38.140 --> 27:40.223
Lord Hamilton, we haven't
been formally introduced.

27:40.254 --> 27:45.460
I'm Lucian D'Aberville. I wish we'd
met under pleasanter circumstances.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.500
Wherever did you find him?

27:47.540 --> 27:49.540
He's only a friend.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.900
He's also younger than you.

27:54.900 --> 27:58.420
We all know your husband liked to
run around with girls half his age

27:58.460 --> 28:01.940
but, well, as long as you're happy.
That is the most important thing.

28:02.940 --> 28:04.940
Did you know?

28:04.980 --> 28:09.220
Well, when you say,
"We all know your husband..."

28:09.260 --> 28:11.500
do you mean that you know now?

28:12.540 --> 28:14.540
Or that you knew then?

28:18.020 --> 28:20.020
I...

28:20.940 --> 28:22.940
We all felt so sorry for you.

28:28.900 --> 28:31.180
I'm trying to remember
where we've met.

28:44.420 --> 28:47.340
Coffee, dessert
and the best man's speech.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.060
Which I'm guessing
you still haven't written.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.100
I'll think of something.

28:52.140 --> 28:54.460
It all seems a bit inappropriate now.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.500
Well, what else can we do?

29:09.700 --> 29:11.700
They seem happy, don't they?

29:16.740 --> 29:18.740
Do you think that will ever be us?

29:23.820 --> 29:25.820
I don't think so. No.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.100
We have to be honest with ourselves.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.140
We both are in different worlds.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.180
And...

29:33.220 --> 29:37.020
no matter how much we want to make it
work, it probably won't, will it?

29:39.860 --> 29:43.580
I mean, with all that is going on,
it's a good place to leave things.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.620
If that's what you want,

29:45.660 --> 29:47.660
Lord Hamilton.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
Dora!

30:49.932 --> 30:51.932
Dora!

30:51.972 --> 30:53.972
Dora!

30:56.372 --> 30:58.372
Ada!

31:06.092 --> 31:08.092
Dora!

31:12.732 --> 31:15.092
Dora!

31:16.892 --> 31:18.892
God. Dora!

31:18.932 --> 31:20.932
Ada!

31:21.972 --> 31:23.972
Be careful, Peggy.

31:31.972 --> 31:33.972
Peggy, Peggy...

31:40.732 --> 31:42.732
Peggy, Peggy.

31:45.572 --> 31:47.572
Peggy. Peggy. Peggy!

31:47.612 --> 31:49.612
Peggy, look.

31:49.652 --> 31:51.652
Dora! Dora?

31:52.812 --> 31:54.812
Mum...

31:54.852 --> 31:56.852
- Mummy.
- I'm here, darling.

31:59.972 --> 32:01.972
- I need to move this.
- Mummy.

32:02.012 --> 32:04.012
Stay there. Give me your hand.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.052
Give me your hand. I've got you.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.092
Come on, darling. Come on.

32:08.132 --> 32:10.132
Good girl.

32:15.012 --> 32:17.012
- Dora!
- Are you OK?

32:17.052 --> 32:19.052
- Yes.
- Bring your body forward.

32:19.092 --> 32:21.092
That's it.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.292
Argh!

32:27.972 --> 32:29.972
Good girl, Good girl.

32:30.012 --> 32:32.012
Come on, come on.

32:36.092 --> 32:38.092
Thank God.

32:38.132 --> 32:40.132
Thank God.

32:45.132 --> 32:49.132
<i>The real horror is...
this is what we call civilisation.</i>

32:51.292 --> 32:53.292
We say we're not savages

32:53.332 --> 32:55.332
but the things we do...

32:57.532 --> 32:59.812
Families
caught in the middle of it all.

33:06.932 --> 33:08.932
I'm sorry for the way I have been.

33:10.132 --> 33:12.132
I wasn't angry, Max.

33:12.172 --> 33:15.292
I was worried.
Believe me, I understand.

33:16.492 --> 33:19.252
Navy at 20, me and all my pals.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.132
Like wee lambs

33:22.172 --> 33:24.172
gambolling off to the slaughter.

33:32.332 --> 33:34.332
And... well...

33:35.532 --> 33:37.652
I was the only one
that made it home.

33:40.332 --> 33:42.332
Sometimes that's worse.

33:43.852 --> 33:45.852
Being the survivor.

33:45.892 --> 33:48.492
You've got to keep
your head above water, Max.

33:49.332 --> 33:51.492
Your family might have made it out.

33:52.332 --> 33:54.332
- I would have known.
- How?

33:54.372 --> 33:56.372
If they'd escaped to England,

33:56.412 --> 33:59.492
it's not like they can just stroll
down Pall Mall, is it?

34:00.372 --> 34:02.372
They would be interned on the coast.

34:02.412 --> 34:04.412
- Yeah.
- Like everyone else.

34:05.932 --> 34:07.932
I want to find out.

34:07.972 --> 34:09.972
I'd ask Mr. Feldman.

34:10.012 --> 34:11.360
That man...

34:11.386 --> 34:12.985
knows everything.

34:13.831 --> 34:15.831
At least he says he does.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.670
Is... is the cake ready?

34:32.071 --> 34:34.071
Take it down to the shelter.

34:34.110 --> 34:36.110
And stay there.

34:36.150 --> 34:38.150
Go on.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.951
- What about you?
- I'll be two minutes.

35:12.273 --> 35:15.673
Please make your way up to the bar
for the cutting of the cake.

35:32.420 --> 35:35.140
We cannot talk of tomorrow any more.

35:36.660 --> 35:38.660
We can hope...

35:38.700 --> 35:40.700
and pray.

35:42.020 --> 35:44.300
<i>But our futures are uncertain now.</i>

35:46.220 --> 35:48.220
Mr. Garland.

35:48.260 --> 35:50.260
But what I know is this.

35:51.820 --> 35:53.820
Love...

35:53.860 --> 35:55.860
doesn't change.

35:56.700 --> 35:58.700
It will last,

35:58.740 --> 36:02.420
no matter what obstacles
or challenges face us.

36:03.420 --> 36:05.420
Because it is ours

36:05.460 --> 36:07.460
<i>and ours alone.</i>

36:08.180 --> 36:10.180
We are defined...

36:10.220 --> 36:12.220
by those who love us...

36:14.540 --> 36:16.740
and whom we choose to love
in return.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.820
To the bride and groom.

36:22.860 --> 36:24.860
The bride and groom.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.140
Mr. D'Aberville.

37:12.180 --> 37:14.180
- Your Ladyship.
- Well?

37:20.860 --> 37:23.660
- Highly inappropriate.
- I don't care.

38:14.620 --> 38:16.620
Try not to hate him.

38:26.020 --> 38:28.020
It's unbelievable out there.

38:28.060 --> 38:31.340
Sirens, ambulances, fire trucks.
Even the sky is on fire.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.380
I've never seen anything like it.

38:33.420 --> 38:35.420
Have you heard from your father?

38:36.180 --> 38:38.500
Let's just hope that...

38:40.420 --> 38:42.420
No.

38:42.460 --> 38:44.460
God, they're coming back.

38:48.260 --> 38:50.260
We need to go. Come on.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.620
Did you get any sleep?

40:23.220 --> 40:25.420
You said
you'd got rid of your trumpet.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.900
Got rid of it, pawned it,
what's the difference?

40:33.940 --> 40:35.940
What did you do with the money?

40:35.980 --> 40:38.900
This is one of those times
I need you to be honest.

40:40.140 --> 40:43.260
I knew your mother was struggling
so I lent her a little.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.980
So she wouldn't ask me.

40:45.020 --> 40:47.540
So she wouldn't put you both in that
position.

40:47.580 --> 40:50.300
- It's just a trumpet, Bets...
- No, it was your father's.

40:50.340 --> 40:52.340
Why?

40:52.380 --> 40:54.660
- Why would you do that for me?
- Because...

40:56.420 --> 40:58.420
Because I look after my band.

40:58.460 --> 41:00.540
That's why my name
is on the drum kit.

41:01.380 --> 41:03.380
You would have done the same for me.

41:14.220 --> 41:16.220
Come in.

41:17.620 --> 41:19.620
I apologise for disturbing you.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.060
No, that's fine. I was just...

41:26.180 --> 41:28.180
getting ready for work.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.020
Mr. Hamilton...

41:35.020 --> 41:37.020
What I did yesterday...

41:37.060 --> 41:39.060
it was wrong and I...

41:39.100 --> 41:41.700
I understand
if you wish for me to resign. I...

41:41.740 --> 41:43.740
It's not necessary.

41:44.580 --> 41:46.580
This bloody thing.

41:49.020 --> 41:51.020
I'm meant to be clever.

41:52.180 --> 41:54.180
Know how to analyse things.

41:55.180 --> 41:58.620
And break them down
and understand all the patterns.

42:03.820 --> 42:05.820
But I have never made sense...

42:10.140 --> 42:12.140
until yesterday.

42:35.020 --> 42:37.020
Hello...

42:37.060 --> 42:39.060
Toby.

43:29.380 --> 43:31.380
A long night?

43:33.820 --> 43:36.260
I can't believe
the bastards came back.

43:37.660 --> 43:40.300
Used the fires as goddamn guidelines.

43:45.620 --> 43:47.620
You're gonna miss him.

43:47.660 --> 43:49.660
It's not like that.

43:51.460 --> 43:54.180
Hell, even I think
the man looks good in uniform.

43:54.220 --> 43:56.220
No.

43:57.700 --> 43:59.700
We wouldn't be suited.

44:02.620 --> 44:04.620
Yeah, I guess not.

44:05.580 --> 44:07.580
He's an aristo, you're staff.

44:07.620 --> 44:11.140
It's a dictionary definition
of a disaster waiting to happen.

44:13.820 --> 44:16.580
It must be wonderful to be so wise,
Mr. O'Hara.

44:21.700 --> 44:23.820
You don't think
it was just one night?

44:23.860 --> 44:25.860
No, it's retribution.

44:25.900 --> 44:27.900
For the Great War.

44:27.940 --> 44:31.260
Our past was always going to catch
up with us sooner or later.

44:32.660 --> 44:34.660
Good luck, Lord Hamilton.

44:35.580 --> 44:37.580
Thank you, Mr. Garland.

44:41.580 --> 44:43.580
One more thing.

44:44.860 --> 44:47.940
I don't know why you have decided to
treat my daughter this way.

44:47.980 --> 44:49.980
Whether you have good reason.

44:51.220 --> 44:53.220
But if you come near her again...

44:54.020 --> 44:56.700
I will ignore my position
and your status...

44:57.740 --> 44:59.740
and I will make you pay.
