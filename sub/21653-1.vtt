03:26.897 --> 03:30.207
You know, we're gonna probably have
to sleep in my sister's empty room.

03:30.267 --> 03:32.209
Probably don't even hold
my hand around around her.

03:32.269 --> 03:34.336
It's gonna be good, right?

03:36.173 --> 03:40.651
Hey, um, you told her I was coming, right?

03:40.711 --> 03:43.287
I actually haven't gotten
a chance to talk to them yet.

03:43.347 --> 03:45.155
Stop this.

03:45.215 --> 03:46.623
Are you serious?

03:46.683 --> 03:49.518
Just make a good impression.
They're very protective.

03:50.687 --> 03:52.362
Oh. Oh, okay.

03:52.422 --> 03:54.698
Oh, I see... I see the game we're playing.

03:54.758 --> 03:56.767
I literally almost...
I was like, "Just leave me here.

03:56.827 --> 03:58.735
I'm just gonna live in the subway forever."

03:58.795 --> 04:01.438
- God.
- They're gonna love you.

04:01.498 --> 04:04.174
Oh, yeah. I really hope so. Yeah. Yeah.

04:04.234 --> 04:06.543
<i>...exit in an orderly fashion.</i>

04:06.603 --> 04:09.146
<i>All service at this station is suspended.</i>

04:09.206 --> 04:10.514
- That's weird, right?
- <i>This is an emergency.</i>

04:10.574 --> 04:12.216
I don't know. Trains go out all the time.

04:12.276 --> 04:14.351
At least we didn't get stuck in the tunnel.

04:14.411 --> 04:17.488
<i>All service at this station is suspended.</i>

04:17.548 --> 04:19.456
That's like a real-life thing that happens?

04:19.516 --> 04:21.158
You just get stuck down there?

04:21.218 --> 04:24.761
Yeah, one time we had a blackout,
and I had to use my phone for light.

04:24.821 --> 04:26.430
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.490 --> 04:29.633
That... You just described my worst
nightmare to me, just right back at me.

04:29.693 --> 04:31.635
Gives me anxiety just to think
about being stuck there.

04:31.695 --> 04:33.337
Why are you acting like such a baby?

04:33.397 --> 04:35.506
I'm not a baby. You're a baby.
Your face is a baby.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.809
But it's a normal human-being thing not to
want to get stuck underground, you know.

04:38.869 --> 04:40.644
Why do you say I'm weird? Tell me.

04:40.704 --> 04:42.546
Because you're not being very manly.

04:42.606 --> 04:44.448
Aren't you supposed to be all,
you know, protective and tough?

04:44.508 --> 04:45.816
Oh. Okay, cool.

04:45.876 --> 04:47.317
I'm supposed to be protective of you.

04:47.377 --> 04:49.686
I would, if I had, like, an incentive.

04:49.746 --> 04:52.848
- Like what?
- Um, I can't think of...

04:55.319 --> 04:56.393
Yeah, it feels a little better.

04:56.453 --> 04:57.728
- Mm-hmm.
- I... Yeah.

04:57.788 --> 05:00.230
Manlier, macho, I'd say.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.590
Shut up.

05:05.629 --> 05:07.471
Okay, this is a little weird.

05:07.531 --> 05:09.198
Nobody here, huh?

05:12.269 --> 05:15.579
- Where'd everybody go?
- I don't know.

05:15.639 --> 05:17.606
They're just ahead of us, right?

05:19.276 --> 05:21.652
It's probably just a drill.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.487
- After you.
- Thank you.

05:23.547 --> 05:25.114
Yeah.

05:26.917 --> 05:29.058
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What the fuck?

05:29.118 --> 05:30.460
Holy shit!

05:30.520 --> 05:32.362
- Holy shit.
- We got to...

05:32.422 --> 05:34.865
- No, no, no. Don't.
- What? We just leave him there?

05:34.925 --> 05:36.567
All right.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.402
- Um, let's just...
- Let's just...

05:38.462 --> 05:40.704
No, no, no. Let's just go.
We got to get out of here.

05:40.764 --> 05:43.674
- All right. What...
- Is there police around?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.701
Where the fuck is everybody?

05:46.737 --> 05:48.878
Let's get up to the street.

05:48.938 --> 05:52.375
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Back up. Back up.

05:53.343 --> 05:55.452
- This is not normal.
- What the hell's going on?

05:55.512 --> 05:57.454
Something seriously must be wrong.

05:58.882 --> 06:00.390
Holy shit.

06:00.450 --> 06:01.858
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

06:01.918 --> 06:04.661
I don't know. I've never
seen anything like that.

06:04.721 --> 06:07.364
<i>This is an active combat zone.</i>

06:07.424 --> 06:09.666
<i>Deadly force will be employed against...</i>

06:09.726 --> 06:10.934
All right.

06:10.994 --> 06:12.836
No, no, no. Where are you going?

06:12.896 --> 06:14.938
You stay here where it's safe.
I'm just gonna go check it out.

06:14.998 --> 06:16.440
Honey, I'll be right back, okay?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.775
- Don't. No!
- Stop.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.010
Jose?

06:29.846 --> 06:31.521
Jose?

06:31.581 --> 06:33.523
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

06:33.583 --> 06:35.559
Oh, my God!

06:35.619 --> 06:36.893
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

06:36.953 --> 06:38.829
Oh, my God.

06:42.626 --> 06:44.868
Oh, my God.

06:44.928 --> 06:46.570
Holy shit. Holy shit.

06:46.630 --> 06:49.506
Okay. Um, I'm... I'm gonna go get help.

06:49.566 --> 06:52.042
I'm gonna go get help.

06:52.102 --> 06:55.312
Oh, my God. I'm gonna go
get help at the hospital.

07:01.011 --> 07:04.021
Help! Somebody help me, please!

07:04.081 --> 07:06.482
Somebody help me!

07:08.017 --> 07:09.885
Get the fuck down!

07:11.021 --> 07:12.596
My boyfriend! He's...

07:12.656 --> 07:14.297
They're coming around!

07:59.536 --> 08:01.210
What the...

08:44.481 --> 08:45.714
Hey!

08:46.750 --> 08:48.016
Stop!

08:55.559 --> 08:57.067
Who the fuck are you?

08:57.127 --> 08:59.136
Stay the fuck down!

08:59.196 --> 09:02.973
Ow! I can't breathe.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.108
Ow! That fucking hurts.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.837
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

09:46.510 --> 09:48.043
Shit.

09:49.112 --> 09:50.579
Okay.

10:13.236 --> 10:15.879
- Man, fuck this.
- All right. All right.

10:16.773 --> 10:18.941
- Hey!
- Fuck was that?

10:21.678 --> 10:23.178
Motherfucker went over there.

10:26.883 --> 10:28.024
- You good?
- Yeah.

10:28.084 --> 10:30.126
Go ahead. Go ahead.

10:31.321 --> 10:33.497
Go ahead. I got you.

10:39.729 --> 10:41.505
Where the fuck you go?

10:41.565 --> 10:42.906
Nothing.

10:42.966 --> 10:44.774
Empty in here, too.

10:46.269 --> 10:48.745
Oh, ho, ho. Look at this. What do you think?

10:48.805 --> 10:51.715
You think someone lives
in this fucking shithole?

10:51.775 --> 10:53.750
I fucking hope not.

10:53.810 --> 10:55.777
All right. Well, grab what you can.

10:57.781 --> 10:59.989
Yo, it fucking stinks in here.

11:04.788 --> 11:06.722
Old-ass shit everywhere.

11:10.927 --> 11:12.928
All right. All right.

11:14.297 --> 11:16.139
- You ready?
- Yeah.

11:16.199 --> 11:20.076
One, two, three.

11:20.136 --> 11:22.279
Oh, hey! Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

11:22.339 --> 11:24.814
Damn! Fuck, bro! She fuckin' maced me, bro!

11:24.874 --> 11:27.017
Oh, yeah. And it's a bitch. Get up.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.286
- Fuck her up!
- Up.

11:29.346 --> 11:31.721
Ah, ah, ah. Drop it.

11:31.781 --> 11:33.223
Drop it.

11:33.283 --> 11:36.192
Hands on your head. Hands on your head.

11:36.252 --> 11:38.029
Thank you.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.964
It fucking burns, man.

11:42.692 --> 11:46.102
Look at that. That's all you got?
This cheap piece of shit?

11:47.897 --> 11:50.966
Come on, give me your fucking purse, now!

11:57.207 --> 11:59.182
Fucking chump change, man.

11:59.242 --> 12:02.311
Hey. Hey. You ain't got nothing, do you?

12:04.381 --> 12:05.847
Get on the bed.

12:06.983 --> 12:07.958
- No.
- N...

12:08.018 --> 12:10.685
Oh. No?

12:11.187 --> 12:12.354
No?

12:15.291 --> 12:17.133
White bitch got something to say, huh?

12:17.193 --> 12:19.035
Hey, you think you're better than us?

12:19.095 --> 12:21.104
- Huh?
- No, I don't.

12:21.164 --> 12:24.908
Bushwick is our neighborhood.

12:24.968 --> 12:27.711
When you white bitches gonna learn that?

12:27.771 --> 12:29.245
I'm from here, and I'm just
trying to go home.

12:29.305 --> 12:31.348
- Oh, you're from here? Oh.
- Look at that.

12:31.408 --> 12:33.216
- Oh she's got tears.
- She's from here.

12:33.276 --> 12:34.784
Get the fuck out of here, you're from here.

12:34.844 --> 12:37.187
I will give you a reason to cry.

12:37.247 --> 12:38.822
How about that?

12:38.882 --> 12:42.150
Yeah. One big-ass reason.

12:46.154 --> 12:49.699
Damn. Let's see what you got under here.

12:49.759 --> 12:51.093
Looks good.

12:52.362 --> 12:53.737
- Oh!
- Oh! What the fuck?

12:53.797 --> 12:55.630
Who do you think...

13:01.171 --> 13:03.246
Oh, my God!

13:03.306 --> 13:06.049
Oh! You fucking bitch.

13:16.019 --> 13:17.986
Are you okay?

13:19.189 --> 13:21.323
Are they dead?

13:37.807 --> 13:40.717
- What are you doing in my house?
- I'm... I'm sorry.

13:40.777 --> 13:42.052
You can't just come into
someone's house like that.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.156
- They followed me in here.
- You need to leave.

13:46.216 --> 13:49.259
- They were gonna attack me.
- You need to get out of here.

13:49.319 --> 13:51.061
Do you know what's going on?

13:51.121 --> 13:54.831
There's, like, a whole fucking army
out there that's just killing people.

13:54.891 --> 13:58.268
And I was on the L train,
and there was a man...

13:58.328 --> 14:00.370
Why are you out here?

14:00.430 --> 14:03.807
- What?
- Why are you in Bushwick?

14:03.867 --> 14:05.408
I live here.

14:05.468 --> 14:08.437
And I'm just... I was trying to...

14:14.043 --> 14:18.388
I'm just... I'm home from school, and I'm
trying to just get to my grandma's house,

14:18.448 --> 14:21.825
and she just lives a couple blocks away.

14:21.885 --> 14:23.993
And I...

14:24.053 --> 14:27.197
Fuck. I was supposed to call her
when I got off the...

14:27.257 --> 14:29.933
The cells are overloaded or blocked.

14:29.993 --> 14:31.201
I don't have any cell service.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.469
You're not gonna get through.

14:32.529 --> 14:36.272
She's probably freaking out because I was
supposed to be there already by now.

14:37.732 --> 14:39.375
Oh, God.

14:39.435 --> 14:40.877
Oh, God.

14:40.937 --> 14:43.847
Hey. Hey.

14:50.013 --> 14:51.321
Can you tell me your name?

14:51.381 --> 14:53.156
What's your name?

14:53.216 --> 14:54.390
Hey.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.118
Lucy.

14:56.886 --> 14:58.261
Lucy.

14:58.321 --> 14:59.896
Hey, just do me a fav...

14:59.956 --> 15:01.823
Don't fucking touch me.

15:06.362 --> 15:08.130
Here. Have some water.

15:10.300 --> 15:15.178
They declared martial law,
and my radio went dead.

15:15.238 --> 15:17.547
Not just here, everywhere...

15:17.607 --> 15:21.910
Boston, Chicago, D.C., Manhattan.

15:25.014 --> 15:28.817
Is, um... Is this 9/11 again?

15:30.353 --> 15:31.820
Terrorists?

15:33.890 --> 15:35.457
No, it's different.

15:36.526 --> 15:38.468
It's more tactical.

15:38.528 --> 15:41.371
Tactical? What do you... What do you mean?

15:41.431 --> 15:45.066
I mean it's more tactical.

15:47.170 --> 15:49.404
This isn't an attack.

15:50.940 --> 15:53.316
This is an invasion.

15:53.376 --> 15:55.277
How do you know this?

15:57.247 --> 15:58.955
I mean, this is... this is Bush... Bushwick.

15:59.015 --> 16:00.557
Who fucking invades Bushwick?

16:00.617 --> 16:04.419
I'm not sure who they are,
so we got to get out of here.

16:07.156 --> 16:08.498
I...

16:08.558 --> 16:10.867
This is just really fucking crazy shit.

16:10.927 --> 16:14.462
I'm... I'm just really confused, and I just
want to know what the fuck is going on.

16:19.602 --> 16:22.045
Strategic plan.

16:22.105 --> 16:25.315
It's overwhelm...
overwhelming our defense system.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.375
Are you a cop or something?

16:30.046 --> 16:31.988
Janitor.

16:32.048 --> 16:33.582
How do you know this?

16:38.321 --> 16:40.288
I really want to just go home.

16:41.658 --> 16:43.967
Good luck.

16:44.027 --> 16:45.468
Wait, where are you going?

16:45.528 --> 16:46.569
Hoboken.

16:46.629 --> 16:48.129
Why?

16:49.499 --> 16:51.507
My wife and my son are there.

16:51.567 --> 16:53.109
Well, I just need to get to Cypress Avenue.

16:53.169 --> 16:55.403
It's just a couple blocks that way.

16:57.407 --> 16:59.282
Sorry. I can't help you.

16:59.342 --> 17:01.885
No, no. Please. Don't leave me here.

17:01.945 --> 17:03.445
Please don't leave me here.

17:05.214 --> 17:06.615
Please.

17:08.617 --> 17:11.361
The main assault's probably over.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.631
They're gonna be canvassing block by block.

17:14.691 --> 17:17.358
Just keep your head down.
You'll be all right.

17:24.634 --> 17:26.342
Wait.

17:26.402 --> 17:27.977
Sniper.

17:28.037 --> 17:29.404
I got it.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.341
Wait. What the fuck are you doing?

17:52.094 --> 17:53.473
Stay down.

17:53.553 --> 17:55.463
You're gonna get us both killed.

18:04.741 --> 18:07.583
This is fucked up. We need to find cover.

18:19.288 --> 18:20.455
Shit.

18:23.659 --> 18:25.301
The school.

18:25.361 --> 18:26.995
The school.

18:43.312 --> 18:45.142
Oh, my God.

18:57.126 --> 18:58.735
Come on.

18:58.795 --> 19:00.462
You know where you're going?

19:02.065 --> 19:03.765
I used to go to school here.

19:05.101 --> 19:06.601
What's upstairs?

19:08.204 --> 19:10.480
There's a science lab

19:10.540 --> 19:16.085
and a library and a study hall and, um...

19:16.145 --> 19:18.046
Can we get up to the roof?

19:18.848 --> 19:21.791
Yeah. Teachers used to go up there and smoke.

19:21.851 --> 19:25.228
Okay. Let's get up there
and take a look around

19:25.288 --> 19:26.596
and see if we can see out on the street.

19:26.656 --> 19:28.590
Then we get the hell out of here.

19:31.227 --> 19:32.660
Okay.

19:38.432 --> 19:39.966
Shit.

20:04.427 --> 20:06.135
Do you have a compact?

20:06.195 --> 20:07.670
What?

20:07.730 --> 20:10.073
A compact, the mirror.

20:10.133 --> 20:11.733
Oh, God.

20:38.594 --> 20:40.203
Go.

20:40.263 --> 20:42.271
Go, go, go ahead.

20:42.331 --> 20:43.698
Go ahead.

21:03.352 --> 21:05.194
Don't shoot, please!

21:45.561 --> 21:46.628
Shit.

21:48.731 --> 21:50.632
Hold it. Hold it.

21:57.273 --> 21:59.515
Ah! Grenade!

22:02.302 --> 22:03.945
Oh, fuck.

22:05.748 --> 22:07.949
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

22:25.768 --> 22:28.511
Do you want them to figure out we're up here?

22:28.571 --> 22:30.446
Holy shit. You're bleeding.

22:30.506 --> 22:31.681
Yeah, I know.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.316
I got to take care of it.

22:33.376 --> 22:35.710
We can go over here. Let's go over here.

22:50.593 --> 22:51.926
Oh, my God.

22:53.996 --> 22:55.463
What are you gonna do?

22:57.066 --> 22:59.609
Take this glass out of my leg.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.003
Then cauterize this wound.

23:03.472 --> 23:04.880
I'm gonna need you to help me.

23:04.940 --> 23:06.307
What?

23:07.376 --> 23:08.818
I can't do this.

23:08.878 --> 23:11.520
I don't know how to cauterize a leg.

23:11.580 --> 23:13.648
You... You need a doctor.

23:17.386 --> 23:18.995
Oh!

23:19.055 --> 23:22.498
Hold that there.
Hold it there, just like that.

23:22.558 --> 23:23.725
All right.

23:31.033 --> 23:32.475
All right.

23:32.535 --> 23:33.709
Oh, God.

23:33.769 --> 23:37.413
When I take this glass out, I'm gonna
need you to count to five for me, okay?

23:37.473 --> 23:40.349
- Uh, uh, okay.
- Okay?

23:40.409 --> 23:41.684
Take it out, count to five.

23:41.744 --> 23:42.985
Okay. Yeah.

23:43.045 --> 23:44.762
Oh, God.

23:46.382 --> 23:47.949
Oh, God.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.327
All right, ready? Count.

23:51.387 --> 23:52.695
One.

23:52.755 --> 23:53.763
Two.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.799
Three, four, five.

23:56.859 --> 23:58.326
Five.

24:08.504 --> 24:10.446
Now what?

24:10.506 --> 24:12.907
I need you to do the other side for me.

24:14.076 --> 24:16.018
- No.
- Just like I did.

24:16.078 --> 24:18.054
- Oh, fuck.
- I need you to do it.

24:18.114 --> 24:19.822
I'm bleeding too much. Okay?

24:19.882 --> 24:21.691
Okay. Uh...

24:21.751 --> 24:24.593
Just like I did. Heat the blade.

24:24.653 --> 24:27.496
At least five seconds, okay?

24:27.556 --> 24:29.991
No less, or it's not gonna work.

24:33.062 --> 24:34.537
Ready?

24:34.597 --> 24:37.073
- All right, do it.
- Okay.

24:37.133 --> 24:39.041
Do it.

24:39.101 --> 24:40.876
Okay. Okay. Oh, God.

24:40.936 --> 24:42.278
One.

24:42.338 --> 24:43.746
Two.

24:43.806 --> 24:46.949
Three, four, five.

24:47.009 --> 24:48.476
Five.

24:52.982 --> 24:55.725
Take the alcohol and pour...

24:55.785 --> 24:58.761
Pour alcohol over it really good, okay?

24:58.821 --> 25:00.755
Really good, all over it.

25:04.193 --> 25:07.370
Oh, God. Fuck. It fucking stinks.

25:07.430 --> 25:09.004
Okay.

25:09.064 --> 25:10.998
Wrap it with that gauze.

25:11.667 --> 25:12.908
Wrap it up good.

25:12.968 --> 25:14.902
Nice and tight, right over the wound.

25:20.776 --> 25:22.685
- All right.
- Okay.

25:22.745 --> 25:26.589
Take that tape and wrap it
around there nice and tight

25:26.649 --> 25:28.691
so that gauze won't come off... come off.

25:28.751 --> 25:31.427
- Okay.
- Is this okay?

25:31.487 --> 25:33.562
Really gonna do it like this?

25:33.622 --> 25:34.956
Okay.

25:37.993 --> 25:39.535
I did it.

25:41.230 --> 25:42.764
Holy shit.

25:44.900 --> 25:46.434
Holy shit.

25:47.670 --> 25:49.945
How'd you learn how to do that?

25:50.005 --> 25:52.140
I watched a lot of "ER."

25:53.742 --> 25:55.610
I watched a lot of "ER."

25:58.714 --> 26:00.890
I was in the military.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.817
I was a Marine.

26:03.986 --> 26:06.721
Please, take that. Take it.

26:11.827 --> 26:12.994
What's your name?

26:15.064 --> 26:16.739
Stupe.

26:16.799 --> 26:18.808
- Stupe?
- Call me Stupe. Yeah.

26:18.868 --> 26:22.003
Well, I don't know how to use a gun, Stupe.

26:25.274 --> 26:27.508
Keep your finger off the trigger.

26:29.712 --> 26:32.046
- Don't point it at me.
- I'm sorry.

26:33.516 --> 26:35.049
You look down the barrel.

26:36.652 --> 26:41.030
You line up the front sight
and the back sight.

26:42.558 --> 26:47.570
When you're ready to shoot,
and not until you're ready to shoot,

26:47.630 --> 26:50.706
you put your finger on the trigger,

26:50.766 --> 26:53.201
and you shoot to kill.

27:00.276 --> 27:03.953
Now, we got to get out of here.
Are you ready?

27:04.013 --> 27:06.047
Wait, are you sure you can?

27:07.750 --> 27:09.625
Yeah. I'm good.

27:09.685 --> 27:10.960
You worry about you.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.761
There's a fire escape. Come on.

27:12.821 --> 27:14.055
All right.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.513
Holy fuck.

27:55.197 --> 27:57.298
We're not gonna make it, are we?

27:59.335 --> 28:01.577
We'll make it one block at a time.

28:03.372 --> 28:05.047
Who are they?

28:05.107 --> 28:07.074
I don't know.

28:07.943 --> 28:09.952
What if it's not just Brooklyn?

28:10.012 --> 28:12.755
What if they're in Hoboken, too,
where your family's at?

28:17.319 --> 28:19.094
My family's safe.

28:19.154 --> 28:20.129
Come on.

28:43.412 --> 28:45.754
We can go to Mr. Argo's It's right there.

28:45.814 --> 28:47.181
Right there.

29:15.310 --> 29:17.753
Yo, it's all free now. Stock up.

29:20.349 --> 29:21.790
Is there any new info?

29:21.850 --> 29:23.225
Who cares? Just take whatever you want.

29:23.285 --> 29:24.226
Don't ask questions.

29:24.286 --> 29:27.129
Hey, yo. Let's go.

29:27.189 --> 29:28.797
Are they saying who's doing this?

29:28.857 --> 29:30.866
You have a gun. You figure it out. Peace.

29:30.926 --> 29:32.701
<i>The militants are American.</i>

29:32.761 --> 29:34.103
<i>We don't know that, Fran.</i>

29:34.163 --> 29:37.406
<i>We don't know anything more than
the unreliable eyewitness accounts,</i>

29:37.466 --> 29:39.942
<i>and we just don't have
an official word as of yet.</i>

29:40.002 --> 29:41.977
<i>Why are we being kept in
the dark about all this?</i>

29:42.037 --> 29:45.681
<i>Why is it so important to keep
the public unaware of our situation?</i>

29:45.741 --> 29:47.282
<i>Oh, you've got to be joking.</i>

29:47.342 --> 29:50.185
<i>What you're insinuating
is paranoid and delusional.</i>

29:50.245 --> 29:53.789
<i>I'm saying that, over the last few
years, certain politicians have lied</i>

29:53.849 --> 29:55.724
<i>and swindled and cheated
their way into office,</i>

29:55.784 --> 29:58.060
<i>and this... this kind of domestic terrorism</i>

29:58.120 --> 30:00.195
<i>is not such an illogical conclusion.</i>

30:00.255 --> 30:02.698
<i>We expect to hear from the president shortly.</i>

30:02.758 --> 30:05.768
<i>The government has issued
some initial guidelines.</i>

30:05.828 --> 30:07.002
<i>Stay inside.</i>

30:07.062 --> 30:09.171
<i>Do not answer the door.</i>

30:09.231 --> 30:12.741
<i>The U.S. military will be
setting up extraction points.</i>

30:12.801 --> 30:15.344
<i>This information is coming in
very sporadically.</i>

30:15.404 --> 30:16.712
<i>We'll keep broadcasting as we get more info.</i>

30:16.772 --> 30:17.647
The fucking government.

30:17.707 --> 30:19.381
<i>Bridges and tunnels are closed.</i>

30:19.441 --> 30:21.684
- Useless as usual.
- <i>JFK and LaGuardia are closed.</i>

30:21.744 --> 30:23.252
They got to realize how fucked up this is.

30:23.312 --> 30:24.820
<i>Logan Airport is closed.</i>

30:24.880 --> 30:26.355
My grandmother is not gonna understand.

30:26.415 --> 30:28.123
If soldiers come to her house,
she's not gonna leave.

30:28.183 --> 30:30.092
We have to get there before they do.

30:30.152 --> 30:31.827
Is she close?

30:31.887 --> 30:34.029
She's about a block and a half
on Willoughby Street.

30:38.393 --> 30:39.927
Did you hear that?

30:40.996 --> 30:42.730
Mr. Argo?

30:50.838 --> 30:54.783
Oh, my God. Oh, God. Mr. Argo, what happened?

30:54.843 --> 30:58.787
Candy, they stole candy, fucking candy.

30:58.847 --> 31:02.991
I didn't try to stop them,
but he still stabbed me.

31:03.051 --> 31:04.359
Those guys? They...

31:04.419 --> 31:06.328
Yes.

31:06.388 --> 31:09.123
Ohh. It's all a game to them.

31:11.927 --> 31:13.769
Mr. Argo?

31:13.829 --> 31:16.505
Shit. Mr. Argo?

31:18.333 --> 31:23.045
Lucy. Lucy, we got to get
the fuck out of here.

31:25.407 --> 31:26.774
Okay.

32:03.612 --> 32:05.387
My grandmother's house is that way.

32:05.447 --> 32:06.814
Let's go.

32:16.491 --> 32:18.292
Oh, God. Shit.

32:27.569 --> 32:30.179
Dude, get the fucking bags.
We got to get out of here.

32:31.607 --> 32:35.342
We fucked that guy up, some old dude.

32:36.178 --> 32:37.586
Yo, man, got the keys.

32:37.646 --> 32:39.555
- Got the keys.
- We got to go.

32:41.917 --> 32:44.418
Dragging your ass, man.
Come on, come on, come on.

32:46.054 --> 32:48.197
Yo, come on, man. Let's go.

32:49.057 --> 32:50.165
What the fuck?

32:50.225 --> 32:51.734
Fuck!

32:52.494 --> 32:54.403
Drive, drive, drive.

32:56.164 --> 32:57.906
Oh, my God.

32:58.966 --> 33:02.477
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:02.537 --> 33:04.847
Oh, God. We need to stop the bleeding.

33:04.907 --> 33:06.315
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.549
What the hell were you thinking?

33:10.078 --> 33:11.620
Are you hit anywhere else?

33:11.680 --> 33:13.522
No.

33:13.582 --> 33:16.058
God damn it. What were you thinking?

33:16.118 --> 33:17.326
Fuck.

33:20.022 --> 33:22.865
My finger. There's so much blood.

33:22.925 --> 33:24.533
Oh, my God.

33:24.593 --> 33:27.069
We'll fix it when we get to your
grandmother's house, all right?

33:27.129 --> 33:28.604
Come on. We got to keep moving.

33:28.664 --> 33:30.898
Damn it.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.875
That's the guy that stabbed Mr. Argo.

33:43.211 --> 33:46.080
He fucking killed Mr. Argo for no reason.

33:47.382 --> 33:49.617
He was gonna shoot this guy, too.

33:50.719 --> 33:52.453
What are you doing?

33:53.355 --> 33:55.197
Giving these to help with the pain.

33:55.257 --> 33:56.932
We can't just leave him here.

33:56.992 --> 33:58.166
- We can't just leave him.
- We can't help him.

33:58.226 --> 34:00.094
We got to keep moving!

34:05.567 --> 34:07.910
Let's go. Let's go!

34:07.970 --> 34:09.536
Okay. Okay.

34:45.540 --> 34:48.483
We're coming in. Open the door.

34:48.543 --> 34:50.351
We will use force.

34:50.411 --> 34:52.154
This is an order.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.964
Grandma, where are you?

35:02.024 --> 35:04.333
Grandma? She must be upstairs.

35:06.061 --> 35:09.063
Grandma? Hello?

35:26.448 --> 35:27.982
Lucy?

35:45.833 --> 35:48.135
Her heart wasn't very strong.

35:51.339 --> 35:54.516
I'm so sorry.

35:54.576 --> 35:57.277
I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

36:01.183 --> 36:03.150
Oh, God.

36:05.220 --> 36:06.695
Oh, God.

36:06.755 --> 36:10.090
We should... We should get her off the floor.

36:12.094 --> 36:13.794
Oh, God.

36:35.217 --> 36:37.084
Fuck! God!

37:04.546 --> 37:07.614
Gonna check the front,
see how much time we have.

37:09.451 --> 37:11.318
Here, take these.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.096
They'll help you and your hand.

37:14.156 --> 37:15.622
I'll be right back.

37:52.694 --> 37:55.203
The neighborhood is fighting back.

37:55.263 --> 37:56.763
We got a few minutes.

37:57.399 --> 38:00.742
Get that hand fixed up,
get the fuck out of here.

38:17.652 --> 38:19.319
Is it bad?

38:21.456 --> 38:22.890
Is it bad?

38:23.892 --> 38:25.893
Looks like we stopped a lot of bleeding.

38:39.241 --> 38:42.276
Ow, ow. Shit.

38:43.311 --> 38:44.645
Fuck.

38:45.780 --> 38:49.183
Oh, God. You're such an asshole.

38:49.884 --> 38:51.785
That's what my wife says.

38:54.789 --> 38:57.224
Your wife is a very smart lady.

39:01.730 --> 39:05.632
Bet you can't wait to see her and your kid.

39:11.473 --> 39:13.440
What did you do in the military?

39:14.509 --> 39:17.619
- I was a hospital coroner.
- Ow! Oh, my God!

39:17.679 --> 39:19.454
Oh, my God.

39:19.514 --> 39:21.823
A medic.

39:27.789 --> 39:32.567
So you were a medic. Now you're a janitor.

39:32.627 --> 39:34.436
That's good.

39:34.496 --> 39:36.438
Tired of watching people die.

39:49.311 --> 39:50.978
Oh, God.

39:52.847 --> 39:56.291
I feel weird. I feel really weird.

39:56.351 --> 39:57.618
Like...

39:58.453 --> 40:00.495
I feel like my...

40:00.555 --> 40:04.566
my insides are, like, floating.

40:04.626 --> 40:06.434
It feels good. It feels...

40:06.494 --> 40:08.970
I'm not complaining, but it just...

40:09.030 --> 40:10.605
I don't know what's going on.

40:10.665 --> 40:11.898
I just...

40:13.068 --> 40:14.843
Oh, my God.

40:14.903 --> 40:17.412
Oh, my God.

40:17.472 --> 40:20.374
What am I gonna do when I get married?

40:22.977 --> 40:24.845
Jose.

40:25.980 --> 40:29.449
I guess it doesn't
really matter anymore, huh?

40:30.618 --> 40:32.761
Why God gave you two hands, right?

40:33.821 --> 40:35.897
Got nine fingers left.

40:42.497 --> 40:44.464
Do you believe in God?

40:46.368 --> 40:48.076
I do.

40:48.136 --> 40:49.836
I believe in God.

40:54.976 --> 40:56.843
Thank you for helping me.

41:00.382 --> 41:02.316
Who said I was helping you?

41:04.586 --> 41:05.760
Open the door.

41:20.502 --> 41:22.476
Is there another way out?

41:22.536 --> 41:23.870
The basement.

41:32.414 --> 41:33.985
Lucy!

42:14.789 --> 42:16.798
Oh, I feel really sick.

42:27.068 --> 42:29.644
My sister's house is that way.
We're gonna go that way.

42:29.704 --> 42:31.546
No. The soldiers went that way.

42:31.606 --> 42:32.914
No. We're gonna go that way.
We're gonna get my sister.

42:32.974 --> 42:34.816
Come on. Let's go.

42:34.876 --> 42:36.576
Well, I'm going.

42:38.746 --> 42:40.522
Lucy!

42:40.582 --> 42:41.815
Fuck!

42:43.117 --> 42:44.818
Goddamn it.

43:09.644 --> 43:11.553
Fuck are you doing?

43:16.084 --> 43:18.159
My sister lives here.

43:18.219 --> 43:19.702
Okay?

43:56.791 --> 43:58.600
- Hey.
- Hi.

43:58.660 --> 44:00.235
- Who the fuck is that guy?
- No, no, no.

44:00.295 --> 44:01.836
- Who the fuck is that guy?
- Shut her up.

44:01.896 --> 44:03.071
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- Shut her up.

44:03.131 --> 44:04.606
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
- Lucy!

44:04.666 --> 44:06.207
- Will you shut her up?
- No, no, no. Stop.

44:06.267 --> 44:09.110
Calm down. Relax. Listen to me.

44:09.170 --> 44:10.778
- Get out!
- No, no, no. Listen to me.

44:10.838 --> 44:13.047
Jose is dead, and this guy
saved me from these...

44:13.107 --> 44:14.282
- He's a friend.
- What?

44:14.342 --> 44:16.050
Are you on drugs? Did he fucking drug you?

44:16.110 --> 44:17.719
- No.
- Motherfucker!

44:17.779 --> 44:20.288
Hey, do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

44:20.348 --> 44:22.156
What? No. I've been asleep.

44:22.216 --> 44:24.125
The fucking neighbors have been
blasting "Call of Duty" all day,

44:24.185 --> 44:25.560
and it just woke me up.

44:25.620 --> 44:28.897
You haven't heard any of these helicopters
or anything that's been going on?

44:28.957 --> 44:31.933
Lucy, there's always helicopters.

44:31.993 --> 44:33.835
This is Brooklyn. You've been
gone too long, college girl.

44:33.895 --> 44:35.695
Listen, listen. Sit down. Sit.

44:36.998 --> 44:38.873
Okay. I want you to pay attention to me.

44:38.933 --> 44:40.675
Why are you being so serious?

44:40.735 --> 44:43.177
I was thrown on the ground
and zip-tied by this soldier,

44:43.237 --> 44:45.947
and then there was these two guys
that followed me into this basement.

44:46.007 --> 44:48.942
And then this guy, he helped me.
He saved my life.

44:51.913 --> 44:54.088
What? This is...

44:54.148 --> 44:56.591
This is... This is too much.

44:56.651 --> 44:59.794
My... My brain is gonna melt.

44:59.854 --> 45:02.222
This is... Lucy, this is too much.

45:07.061 --> 45:10.705
I mean, Lucy, I think you're
just a little too high, man.

45:10.765 --> 45:12.874
- But...
- No. I'm not on any...

45:12.934 --> 45:16.077
I mean, I... Well, I am on drugs.

45:16.137 --> 45:18.938
I'm on drugs that he gave me
for my finger, but that's it.

45:23.644 --> 45:24.886
All right. I'm gonna...

45:24.946 --> 45:28.156
I'm gonna go get my shit together,
and then when I get back,

45:28.216 --> 45:31.025
you and me and him,
we're getting out of here.

45:31.085 --> 45:32.994
We're gonna get somewhere safe, okay?

45:35.823 --> 45:37.832
What about Grandma?

45:37.892 --> 45:39.601
She's gone.

45:39.661 --> 45:41.903
No. What?

45:41.963 --> 45:43.671
What?

45:43.731 --> 45:45.239
- What?
- I didn't know what to do.

45:45.299 --> 45:46.941
- No.
- I'm sorry.

45:48.001 --> 45:49.377
Okay.

45:49.437 --> 45:50.878
- I'll be right back.
- Lucy.

45:50.938 --> 45:52.839
Hey, keep an eye on her for me.

46:48.062 --> 46:51.172
That was Oswaldo.

46:51.232 --> 46:54.842
I left the little latch thing open,

46:54.902 --> 46:56.244
and he got out.

46:57.805 --> 46:59.406
Yeah. They'll do that.

47:04.912 --> 47:06.454
What are you...

47:06.514 --> 47:08.948
Are you trying to fuck my sister?

47:13.487 --> 47:14.929
You're sisters?

47:14.989 --> 47:18.066
Yeah. My grandma...

47:18.126 --> 47:20.468
My grandma raised us, so we're sisters.

47:20.528 --> 47:25.398
So don't you try and fuck with
my sister or fuck my sister.

47:26.934 --> 47:29.911
- I'm not trying to fuck her.
- Oh, yeah?

47:29.971 --> 47:32.380
I'm just trying to get through the day.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.308
What are you taking pills for?
What's wrong with you?

47:38.813 --> 47:42.023
I shot a guy. I crushed a guy.

47:42.083 --> 47:46.086
I got glass in my leg, hurts. Needs help.

47:48.089 --> 47:50.256
You, like, a soldier?

47:53.161 --> 47:54.202
I'm a janitor.

47:54.262 --> 47:57.138
A janitor? Right.

47:58.098 --> 47:59.807
I like soldiers.

48:01.469 --> 48:04.337
Hey, what do you think?

48:08.810 --> 48:10.410
It's a cat.

48:12.079 --> 48:14.180
It's a happy pussy.

48:15.883 --> 48:19.393
Meow.

48:19.453 --> 48:21.263
Meow.

48:26.493 --> 48:29.570
- What the fuck?
- Don't even fucking think about it.

48:36.070 --> 48:38.171
Why are you coming in here?

48:39.440 --> 48:41.007
Are you alone?

48:47.048 --> 48:49.023
Don't come in my house!

49:13.040 --> 49:17.518
Lucy, make sure no one
comes up through that window.

49:46.007 --> 49:48.041
You speak English?

49:52.112 --> 49:53.279
Hey.

49:54.582 --> 49:56.516
Where are you from?

49:58.986 --> 50:01.095
Kentucky, sir.

50:05.359 --> 50:07.327
You're an American?

50:09.630 --> 50:12.240
What the fuck is going on?

50:12.300 --> 50:14.976
Texas is seceding from the United States.

50:15.036 --> 50:16.611
Bullshit.

50:16.671 --> 50:19.447
By the order of the fathers
of the New American Coalition.

50:19.507 --> 50:22.116
We are a united force
with the goal of establishing

50:22.176 --> 50:25.019
an independent nation,
free from government tyranny

50:25.079 --> 50:28.155
and the right to live our lives
the true American way.

50:28.215 --> 50:30.625
Yeah. That makes perfect fucking sense.

50:30.685 --> 50:33.152
- Sir?
- Who's "we"?

50:36.190 --> 50:39.000
Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina,

50:39.060 --> 50:41.936
South Carolina, West Virginia,
and Georgia are with us.

50:41.996 --> 50:45.039
Parts of Maryland and
Pennsylvania are on the brink.

50:45.099 --> 50:47.408
It's like a... like a new Civil War?

50:49.203 --> 50:51.979
I served with... with good men
from those states.

50:52.039 --> 50:54.982
Yeah. We're a private army.

50:55.042 --> 50:56.643
Mercenaries?

50:58.079 --> 50:59.545
What's the plan?

51:02.083 --> 51:05.693
We'll force Congress to ratify the secession.

51:05.753 --> 51:09.130
Well, how are you gonna do that?

51:09.190 --> 51:12.992
This... This is how we're
gonna do that, insurgency.

51:16.364 --> 51:19.299
What's the plan here in New York?

51:20.468 --> 51:24.312
We were just supposed to lock
down Bushwick, round people up.

51:24.372 --> 51:25.713
No one gets hurt.

51:25.773 --> 51:30.084
Establish a green zone for further operations
and wait for the president to fold.

51:30.144 --> 51:35.089
We, uh... We didn't anticipate
so much resistance from...

51:35.149 --> 51:37.625
resistance from a designated soft spot.

51:37.685 --> 51:39.585
And why the hell is that?

51:41.322 --> 51:43.297
Ethno-diversity, sir.

51:45.059 --> 51:46.300
Racist motherfucker.

51:46.360 --> 51:49.370
I ain't racist. It's fact.

51:49.430 --> 51:51.706
This racist pig fucker thinks

51:51.766 --> 51:55.543
that because there's so many minorities
here in Brooklyn that we won't fight back?

51:55.603 --> 51:57.478
Well, how's that working out for you?

51:57.538 --> 51:59.013
How? How is that working out?

51:59.073 --> 52:01.607
- Our intel told us...
- Fuck your intel.

52:03.044 --> 52:06.187
There weren't supposed to be so many guns.

52:06.247 --> 52:08.723
They're illegal here.

52:08.783 --> 52:12.026
Welcome to New York, stupid motherfucker.

52:12.086 --> 52:17.423
Once we got blowback, they gave us orders
to shoot on sight if our lives were in danger.

52:18.759 --> 52:20.234
Killing innocent Americans.

52:20.294 --> 52:22.303
I'm just following orders. I'm a soldier.

52:22.363 --> 52:24.505
- What'd you say?
- I'm a soldier, sir.

52:24.565 --> 52:26.640
You don't get to call yourself
a fucking soldier.

52:26.700 --> 52:28.042
You're not a soldier!

52:28.102 --> 52:31.212
Sir, I'm sorry, sir. Sir, please.

52:31.272 --> 52:35.174
Please, I was just... just following orders.

52:38.612 --> 52:40.321
Who's in charge?

52:40.381 --> 52:44.225
Who's the fucking asshole who sent you
and all your dumbass buddies

52:44.285 --> 52:46.686
out here to get yourselves
killed for nothing?

52:51.826 --> 52:53.634
No. Nothing.

52:53.694 --> 52:56.270
It doesn't matter. You're a mindless fuck.

52:56.330 --> 52:57.671
Why would you question your orders?

52:57.731 --> 52:59.373
You were in the military, right?
You understand.

52:59.433 --> 53:01.534
- I can't be second-guessing...
- Shut up.

53:04.839 --> 53:06.806
Where's the DMZ?

53:09.643 --> 53:13.346
- Where's the goddamn DMZ?
- Fuck you. I ain't telling you.

53:15.616 --> 53:18.092
I know where the DMV is.

53:18.152 --> 53:21.328
The DMZ.

53:21.388 --> 53:23.631
What's the DMZ?

53:23.691 --> 53:26.300
It's a demilitarized zone.

53:26.360 --> 53:29.737
It's where our troops are embedded,
where they're getting people out.

53:29.797 --> 53:31.539
And you're gonna fucking tell me.

53:31.599 --> 53:33.474
I'm tired of playing games with you.

53:33.534 --> 53:36.610
You have three fucking seconds, or
I'm gonna blow your goddamn head off.

53:36.670 --> 53:38.813
- Please, sir.
- One, two...

53:38.873 --> 53:41.541
Grover Cleveland Park in Queens.

53:42.910 --> 53:45.186
The U.S. Navy and Coast Guard

53:45.246 --> 53:48.522
are evacuating noncombatants
from there, the ones that make it.

53:48.582 --> 53:49.790
The ones you don't kill first.

53:49.850 --> 53:51.659
No one was supposed to fight back, okay?

53:51.719 --> 53:54.261
We had too many casualties.
They gave us orders.

53:54.321 --> 53:57.498
They told us Bushwick was a
shoot-to-kill zone, us or them.

53:57.558 --> 53:59.300
And we were just supposed to fucking take it?

53:59.360 --> 54:01.402
Those were our orders.

54:01.462 --> 54:03.137
It's not my fault.

54:03.197 --> 54:05.264
Fuck your orders.

54:10.204 --> 54:11.178
- Sir...
- Fuck you.

54:11.238 --> 54:12.538
Sir, please...

54:20.214 --> 54:21.547
Cleveland Park.

54:22.850 --> 54:27.286
Three or five blocks at the most.

54:28.556 --> 54:30.490
We don't have much daylight.

54:31.859 --> 54:33.626
What do you want to do?

54:35.329 --> 54:37.230
It's up to me now?

54:40.301 --> 54:42.301
My leg's fucked.

54:43.404 --> 54:45.538
What do you want to do?

54:47.841 --> 54:50.851
Okay. We're getting out of here.

54:50.911 --> 54:52.520
Is it safe to go out there?

54:52.580 --> 54:54.655
Probably not, but it's not safe in here.

54:54.715 --> 54:56.757
Can I get a gun?

54:56.817 --> 54:58.284
No.

55:03.524 --> 55:06.159
What are we gonna do about him?

55:13.367 --> 55:14.734
Ah!

55:20.841 --> 55:22.249
- Let's go!
- Okay.

55:22.309 --> 55:23.751
Just in case he comes back.

55:49.870 --> 55:51.504
Oh, my God.

55:52.406 --> 55:54.248
Oh, my God. This is real.

55:57.745 --> 55:59.320
I didn't know it was this bad.

56:30.711 --> 56:32.720
I didn't know those guys could fight.

56:32.780 --> 56:35.356
Come on. Let's go. Move.

56:43.857 --> 56:46.967
<i># If I died in my apartment
like a rat in a cage #</i>

56:47.027 --> 56:48.535
<i># Would the neighbors smell the corpse #</i>

56:48.595 --> 56:50.704
<i># Before the cat ate my face? #</i>

56:50.764 --> 56:52.706
Dead yet, pussy?

56:52.766 --> 56:56.310
<i># I'm trying to jettison the ballast
With the hazardous waste #</i>

56:56.370 --> 56:58.412
Sit your ass down.

56:58.472 --> 57:01.415
<i># Steep in a self-imposed
Stockholm and Lima in flux #</i>

57:01.475 --> 57:04.318
<i># Maybe an occupation popular
with demons and ducks #</i>

57:04.378 --> 57:07.054
<i># Made any mingling akin
to being seasoned and stuffed #</i>

57:07.114 --> 57:09.757
Fuck! These streets
are crawling with soldiers.

57:10.617 --> 57:12.559
Let's make a run for it.

57:12.619 --> 57:14.928
Yo, we got to go upstairs.

57:26.867 --> 57:29.035
Inside, go.

57:38.479 --> 57:40.054
Who the fuck are you?!

57:40.114 --> 57:42.089
- Put your fucking guns down.
- Don't shoot.

57:42.149 --> 57:43.657
- Put your fucking guns down.
- Don't shoot.

57:43.717 --> 57:45.059
Put the fucking guns down.

57:45.119 --> 57:46.727
Don't shoot. We're just...

57:46.787 --> 57:48.796
We're just...

57:49.456 --> 57:51.932
We're just trying to stay alive. Okay?

57:51.992 --> 57:53.434
Put your fucking guns down.

57:53.494 --> 57:55.569
Okay. Everybody relax.

57:55.629 --> 57:57.471
Okay? Just relax.

57:57.531 --> 57:58.764
Okay?

58:00.701 --> 58:02.001
Chill.

58:03.070 --> 58:05.012
Okay. All right.

58:05.072 --> 58:07.514
What the fuck are you doing in our building?

58:07.574 --> 58:09.083
You don't know what's going on out there?

58:09.143 --> 58:14.621
Look... if we can all just get
to Cleveland Park,

58:14.681 --> 58:16.457
the U.S. Army is evacuating
people out of here.

58:16.517 --> 58:18.692
- We can get out of here.
- That what you heard?

58:18.752 --> 58:20.127
What does he mean?

58:20.187 --> 58:21.729
What does that mean? Whoa!

58:21.789 --> 58:23.664
What the fuck is wrong with you, James?

58:23.724 --> 58:25.032
Shut up, Ma.

58:25.092 --> 58:28.001
Get your dumb asses up here and sit down.

58:28.061 --> 58:29.962
I said now!

58:30.831 --> 58:33.006
Go! Hurry up.

58:33.066 --> 58:34.533
Whoa.

58:57.090 --> 59:03.103
The United States Army is set up
at a park over in Ridgewood,

59:03.163 --> 59:08.033
helicopters, tanks, whatever else.

59:09.570 --> 59:12.146
Some people know better than to stick around

59:12.206 --> 59:14.815
in a war zone, James.

59:14.875 --> 59:17.651
You don't remember the '70s.

59:17.711 --> 59:20.954
Eventually, they gonna
get us all out of here.

59:21.014 --> 59:24.792
But we... Right now, we can't get to them.

59:24.852 --> 59:26.593
Coalition fuckers in the way.

59:26.653 --> 59:29.496
- Ain't shit, Ma.
- Shut up, now, James.

59:29.556 --> 59:31.999
My boys are tough,
but they ain't tough enough

59:32.059 --> 59:35.836
to get through that blockade by themselves.

59:35.896 --> 59:39.072
Ma'am, we're not gonna
be enough to fight them.

59:39.132 --> 59:41.008
I'm not talking about you.

59:41.068 --> 59:43.744
Two blocks over, Church of God,

59:43.804 --> 59:48.715
we heard they got 30, 40 people
all riled up and ready to go.

59:48.775 --> 59:50.584
So what's the problem?

59:50.644 --> 59:53.854
James, you want to tell these nice folks

59:53.914 --> 59:57.858
why we can't go and ask Father John for help?

59:57.918 --> 59:59.827
We got issues.

59:59.887 --> 01:00:01.762
They need our help.

01:00:01.822 --> 01:00:04.998
They got some people,
but they ain't got enough guns.

01:00:05.058 --> 01:00:08.035
Well, it just so happens that right here,

01:00:08.095 --> 01:00:09.803
- down in this basement...
- Ma.

01:00:09.863 --> 01:00:11.939
...my boy and his little club...

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:14.608
- It's a gang.
- ...they got all kinds

01:00:14.668 --> 01:00:17.644
of weapons... knives, guns, bullets...

01:00:17.704 --> 01:00:21.615
for their little dick-swinging gang bullshit.

01:00:21.675 --> 01:00:22.916
Ma, they can't have our guns.

01:00:22.976 --> 01:00:24.910
Oh, yes, they can.

01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:28.881
This is what we gonna do.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:33.627
James heads over there
and tells them we got they back,

01:00:33.687 --> 01:00:35.062
he gets shot.

01:00:35.122 --> 01:00:38.665
Me? I wouldn't make it
halfway down the block.

01:00:38.725 --> 01:00:40.025
But...

01:00:44.197 --> 01:00:50.210
...this sweet little white girl,
she gonna go for us.

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:51.778
No.

01:00:51.838 --> 01:00:53.747
You two are gonna stay here for insurance.

01:00:53.807 --> 01:00:55.082
- No.
- No. I'm...

01:00:55.142 --> 01:00:57.050
You can't send her out there alone.

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:58.619
I'm not doing that.

01:00:58.679 --> 01:01:01.622
I go with her or no deal.

01:01:01.682 --> 01:01:05.025
I don't recall offering you a deal.

01:01:05.085 --> 01:01:07.586
- I'm not going.
- Look. Look, ma'am.

01:01:08.355 --> 01:01:11.832
You send her out there alone,
she's just gonna get herself killed.

01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:14.535
That's not gonna do
anybody any good, so just...

01:01:14.595 --> 01:01:17.997
You let me go with her.
We'll figure it out, all right?

01:01:19.132 --> 01:01:20.941
I'm not leaving my sister.

01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:22.301
- Please?
- Lucy.

01:01:24.738 --> 01:01:26.071
Please?

01:01:27.307 --> 01:01:31.985
Your sister will be fine.

01:01:32.045 --> 01:01:36.590
You and your bodyguard go tell Father
John we'll meet him at the Laundromat.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:39.626
Tell him we're going there right now.

01:01:39.686 --> 01:01:41.028
You'll see your sister in no time.

01:01:41.088 --> 01:01:43.830
- No. No. No.
- No.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:46.066
James, show these people the front door.

01:01:46.126 --> 01:01:48.602
- No. No. No!
- Let's go. Come on.

01:01:48.662 --> 01:01:49.970
- Come on.
- No!

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:51.338
- Hurry up.
- Come on. God damn it.

01:01:51.398 --> 01:01:52.906
- Lucy!
- Shut the fuck up.

01:01:52.966 --> 01:01:54.775
- Shit!
- Get off me.

01:01:54.835 --> 01:01:56.109
Why are you doing this?

01:01:56.169 --> 01:01:57.344
Don't fuck around. Do what I tell you to do.

01:01:57.404 --> 01:02:00.013
- Don't you fucking touch her.
- Oh, this isn't right, man.

01:02:00.073 --> 01:02:02.916
We're all from the same neighborhood.
We got to stick together.

01:02:02.976 --> 01:02:04.217
We're not from the same neighborhood.

01:02:04.277 --> 01:02:07.346
At least give us our guns, man.
Don't send us out there without our guns.

01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:13.026
Take your fucking guns.
You better meet me at the Laundromat.

01:02:13.086 --> 01:02:14.728
Holy shit.

01:02:15.388 --> 01:02:17.363
It's getting worse.

01:02:21.995 --> 01:02:23.963
How are we gonna get Belinda back?

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.097
Are you okay? Do you need help?

01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:51.690
Can you walk?

01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:10.643
Thank you for helping. Deborah.

01:03:19.186 --> 01:03:20.794
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:20.854 --> 01:03:22.896
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:22.956 --> 01:03:24.931
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:26.967
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:27.027 --> 01:03:29.069
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:29.129 --> 01:03:31.138
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:31.198 --> 01:03:33.173
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:33.233 --> 01:03:35.308
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:35.368 --> 01:03:37.411
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:39.279
- Whose street?
- Our street.

01:03:39.339 --> 01:03:40.881
Whose street?

01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:18.885
Lucy.

01:04:31.258 --> 01:04:33.066
Bushwick!

01:04:39.032 --> 01:04:41.300
Go, go, go.

01:04:44.137 --> 01:04:47.147
Come on. Come on. Come on. Go inside.

01:04:47.207 --> 01:04:50.409
Come on. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:11.930
Jesus.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.209
Do you see him?

01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:17.944
No.

01:05:18.004 --> 01:05:19.946
He's got to be here somewhere.

01:05:20.006 --> 01:05:21.815
Well, let's find him.

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:23.950
Have you seen Father John?

01:05:35.121 --> 01:05:37.556
Take these over there
to that woman, all right?

01:05:40.427 --> 01:05:42.194
I'll be right back.

01:05:48.468 --> 01:05:50.477
Why don't you see if you can find him?

01:05:50.537 --> 01:05:52.512
I'm going to help out around here.

01:06:11.892 --> 01:06:14.067
Um, excuse me. Where is Father John?

01:06:14.127 --> 01:06:17.863
Um, we've seen a few priests,
don't know their names.

01:06:25.538 --> 01:06:28.415
Excuse me. Are you Father John?

01:06:28.475 --> 01:06:30.016
Who are you?

01:06:30.076 --> 01:06:32.252
There's a group,
and they have a lot of weapons.

01:06:32.312 --> 01:06:35.247
- And they sent me here...
- I'm not Father John.

01:06:36.616 --> 01:06:41.461
He's praying downstairs.

01:06:41.521 --> 01:06:44.130
Right through those doors.

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:45.858
Thank you.

01:07:09.215 --> 01:07:10.924
Father John?

01:07:13.053 --> 01:07:14.987
Hello?

01:07:19.092 --> 01:07:20.659
Father John?

01:07:25.665 --> 01:07:27.466
Hello?

01:07:30.403 --> 01:07:33.046
Multitudes in the valley of decision.

01:07:33.106 --> 01:07:36.549
For the day of the Lord is near
in the valley of decision.

01:07:36.609 --> 01:07:39.286
The sun and the moon grow dark.

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:42.188
Excuse me. Hi.

01:07:42.248 --> 01:07:44.950
I'm looking for Father John.

01:07:50.523 --> 01:07:52.999
I am Father John.

01:07:53.059 --> 01:07:54.301
Oh, okay.

01:07:54.361 --> 01:07:57.604
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

01:07:57.664 --> 01:08:00.373
We need to go to the Laundromat,

01:08:00.433 --> 01:08:04.144
and there's a woman on
Starr Street with her son and...

01:08:04.204 --> 01:08:06.546
Is anyone among you sick?

01:08:06.606 --> 01:08:08.014
Sick?

01:08:08.074 --> 01:08:09.482
No. Wait.

01:08:09.542 --> 01:08:13.253
Let him call for the elders of the church.

01:08:13.313 --> 01:08:15.689
- I...
- And they will pray over him,

01:08:15.749 --> 01:08:18.591
anointing him with oil
in the name of the Father

01:08:18.651 --> 01:08:20.393
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

01:08:20.453 --> 01:08:21.995
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:24.229
We need your help. We have to go.

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.732
You don't understand.

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:32.272
The prayer of faith
will save the one who is sick,

01:08:32.332 --> 01:08:35.133
and the Lord will raise him up.

01:08:36.536 --> 01:08:40.212
If he is guilty of sin, he will be forgiven.

01:08:40.273 --> 01:08:41.715
Oh, shit!

01:08:41.774 --> 01:08:43.316
Fuck!

01:08:43.376 --> 01:08:44.684
Oh, my God.

01:08:44.743 --> 01:08:46.453
You stupid...

01:08:48.113 --> 01:08:50.390
Oh, my God. Shit.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.737
- Did you find Father John?
- He's, um... He's gone.

01:09:37.796 --> 01:09:39.139
What do you mean, he's gone?

01:09:39.198 --> 01:09:40.607
We have to go. We have to go now.

01:09:40.667 --> 01:09:42.274
Father John wouldn't leave this congregation.

01:09:42.335 --> 01:09:43.343
- He's gone. We have to go.
- You didn't answer me.

01:09:43.403 --> 01:09:44.611
Is Father John okay?

01:09:44.671 --> 01:09:46.546
He did it to himself.

01:09:56.549 --> 01:09:59.059
Okay. Listen. Listen up.

01:09:59.119 --> 01:10:01.795
Um, it's not going to be safe
here for very much longer.

01:10:01.855 --> 01:10:03.596
So we need to... we need to go.

01:10:03.656 --> 01:10:06.499
Anybody who is able, please
help somebody who's injured.

01:10:06.559 --> 01:10:09.269
We are going to all meet at the
Laundromat on Cypress Avenue,

01:10:09.329 --> 01:10:12.572
where we will meet a group of people that
have a lot of weapons, and from there,

01:10:12.632 --> 01:10:17.277
we are going to get to the evacuation
helicopters inside Cleveland Park.

01:10:17.337 --> 01:10:20.346
We need to stick together,
but we need to go now.

01:10:25.411 --> 01:10:26.853
Stupe, come on. Let's go.

01:10:26.913 --> 01:10:28.421
- What happened to Father John?
- We have to go now.

01:10:28.481 --> 01:10:30.156
- No. He's gone.
- I can't just leave him...

01:10:30.216 --> 01:10:31.357
We have to go. We have to go now.

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:32.625
- Just let me finish this.
- No.

01:10:32.685 --> 01:10:34.327
Stupe, come on.

01:10:34.387 --> 01:10:36.162
His shoulder is fucked.

01:10:36.222 --> 01:10:39.232
Jesus. Go. Go. Go. Stupe.

01:10:39.292 --> 01:10:40.733
Just give me two minutes. God damn it.

01:10:40.793 --> 01:10:42.569
I will meet you by the front door. Come on.

01:10:42.629 --> 01:10:44.696
Lucy! Shit.

01:10:45.698 --> 01:10:47.566
Come on. Let's go.

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:04.014
Open this fucking door!

01:11:09.722 --> 01:11:11.631
Open the door!

01:11:16.461 --> 01:11:17.871
Oh, shit.

01:11:26.906 --> 01:11:28.740
Stand down.

01:11:52.232 --> 01:11:53.873
Shit.

01:11:53.933 --> 01:11:56.743
Holy shit. Are you okay?

01:11:56.803 --> 01:11:58.278
Yeah. I'm okay.

01:11:58.338 --> 01:12:00.813
Yes, yes. I can get up. I'm okay.

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.575
Let's go.

01:12:05.378 --> 01:12:07.420
Ouch.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.190
Let's go. Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.592
Come on. Go. Go. Move.

01:12:12.652 --> 01:12:14.727
I just killed a guy with an ax.

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:12.777
Where is everybody?

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.615
I don't know.

01:13:17.884 --> 01:13:19.792
Are we supposed to meet them inside?

01:13:19.852 --> 01:13:21.928
Are we supposed to meet them outside?

01:13:21.988 --> 01:13:25.398
We were just with everybody,
and where did they go?

01:13:25.458 --> 01:13:27.567
How long do you think it's gonna
take for Belinda to get here?

01:13:27.627 --> 01:13:29.828
I don't fucking know!

01:13:31.331 --> 01:13:34.507
Can you be patient for one fucking second?

01:13:34.567 --> 01:13:36.943
I don't want to be here any more than you do.

01:14:30.923 --> 01:14:33.825
So what year of college are you?

01:14:38.865 --> 01:14:41.066
Second-year grad student.

01:14:44.904 --> 01:14:46.805
What are you studying?

01:14:48.541 --> 01:14:50.442
Civil engineering.

01:14:52.044 --> 01:14:54.854
That's great. That's great.

01:14:54.914 --> 01:14:58.783
You'll be able to help make a difference.

01:15:01.053 --> 01:15:02.061
That's great.

01:15:10.129 --> 01:15:12.597
How old's your kid? You never told me.

01:15:28.114 --> 01:15:32.450
When my wife and I used to argue,
she'd get pretty worked up at me.

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.820
And I'm so stubborn.

01:15:37.223 --> 01:15:40.133
She'd get so frustrated, and she'd...

01:15:40.193 --> 01:15:41.901
she'd lose her temper with me.

01:15:41.961 --> 01:15:46.172
And she'd say, "Stupe,
you're such a fucking asshole."

01:15:46.232 --> 01:15:48.166
I can be.

01:15:50.603 --> 01:15:53.738
But almost immediately, she'd come over.

01:15:56.175 --> 01:15:58.084
And she'd put her hands on my face.

01:15:58.144 --> 01:16:00.678
And she'd say, "But you're <i>my</i> asshole."

01:16:03.983 --> 01:16:06.050
We were so in love.

01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:11.122
And my son...

01:16:14.694 --> 01:16:19.964
My son was so beautiful, so smart.

01:16:23.202 --> 01:16:25.837
I wish you could have seen him.

01:16:29.942 --> 01:16:31.843
They're dead.

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:38.049
They were killed in
the World Trade Center attacks.

01:16:45.157 --> 01:16:47.867
And I was so angry.

01:16:47.927 --> 01:16:49.969
I was so full of hate.

01:16:50.029 --> 01:16:52.497
I just wanted someone to pay.

01:16:54.967 --> 01:16:57.602
So I enlisted in the Marine Corps.

01:17:02.575 --> 01:17:05.985
About a year and a half later,
they shipped me over to Iraq,

01:17:06.045 --> 01:17:08.546
and I got my chance to fight.

01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:13.659
I thought it would make me feel better,

01:17:13.719 --> 01:17:16.488
but it just made me feel worse.

01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:21.593
I did a lot of things I'm not real proud of.

01:17:24.263 --> 01:17:26.188
So, uh...

01:17:28.634 --> 01:17:30.969
I became a hospital corpsman.

01:17:32.872 --> 01:17:36.649
'Cause I thought
if I saved lives, that would...

01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:41.613
that would make me feel better, but I just...

01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:45.683
I lost more men than I saved.

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.921
And one day...

01:17:52.124 --> 01:17:55.001
...after months of nightmares

01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:59.605
and not being able to keep
my goddamn hands from shaking,

01:17:59.665 --> 01:18:01.699
I just stopped.

01:18:05.037 --> 01:18:07.138
I just...

01:18:08.741 --> 01:18:13.111
I couldn't bear to watch
one more fucking person die.

01:18:18.317 --> 01:18:21.961
So they sent me home on a medical discharge,

01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:25.256
and I just turned myself off.

01:18:26.726 --> 01:18:30.862
For years, I just wanted to be invisible.

01:18:34.367 --> 01:18:38.778
And here I am again,
right in the middle of it,

01:18:38.838 --> 01:18:42.248
right in the middle of all this
fucking death and killing.

01:18:42.308 --> 01:18:46.018
It's like it's being shoved
down my fucking throat,

01:18:46.078 --> 01:18:47.653
and it just goes on and on.

01:18:47.713 --> 01:18:51.783
It just never stops,
and it's fucking for what?

01:18:53.786 --> 01:18:55.261
For what?

01:19:03.162 --> 01:19:07.899
When my family died, I died with them.

01:19:11.971 --> 01:19:15.081
But we're gonna get out of here.
We're gonna get Belinda.

01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:17.275
We're gonna get the fuck out of here.

01:19:23.282 --> 01:19:25.316
Thank you for telling me.

01:19:26.752 --> 01:19:29.228
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:19:29.288 --> 01:19:32.624
I've just never really
been able to talk about it.

01:19:34.393 --> 01:19:37.395
Why'd you tell me you had to go to Hoboken?

01:19:43.402 --> 01:19:46.779
I thought if I told you
I was going to Hoboken,

01:19:46.839 --> 01:19:49.315
no fucking way you'd try to follow me.

01:19:51.877 --> 01:19:54.245
Who the fuck wants to go to Hoboken?

01:19:56.215 --> 01:19:57.650
You.

01:20:01.053 --> 01:20:03.354
I got to take a piss.

01:20:22.808 --> 01:20:24.108
Stupe!

01:20:29.949 --> 01:20:33.192
- What the fuck did you do?
- I'm so sorry.

01:20:33.252 --> 01:20:35.795
He came at me, and I...

01:20:41.427 --> 01:20:43.961
Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!

01:20:46.198 --> 01:20:48.175
Oh, my God.

01:20:50.469 --> 01:20:51.911
Oh, my God.

01:20:51.971 --> 01:20:53.871
Stupe.

01:20:54.507 --> 01:20:57.016
Stupe. Stupe.

01:20:57.076 --> 01:20:59.351
Wake up. Wake up.

01:20:59.411 --> 01:21:01.420
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.322
Fuck.

01:21:03.382 --> 01:21:05.124
I don't know... I don't know what to do.

01:21:05.184 --> 01:21:06.225
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

01:21:06.285 --> 01:21:08.727
I'll just... Let me help you.

01:21:08.987 --> 01:21:11.756
Let me... I don't...

01:21:12.992 --> 01:21:14.959
Damn it.

01:21:25.004 --> 01:21:28.247
I'm so sorry.

01:21:28.307 --> 01:21:30.842
What am I gonna do?

01:21:37.850 --> 01:21:39.158
Fuck.

01:21:39.218 --> 01:21:40.785
Sorry.

01:22:17.056 --> 01:22:18.497
Lucy!

01:22:18.557 --> 01:22:21.066
Lucy. Oh, yes!

01:22:21.126 --> 01:22:24.036
Ohh. I thought I lost you, too.

01:22:24.096 --> 01:22:25.838
Are you okay? What happened?

01:22:25.898 --> 01:22:27.072
Did they do... Hey, hey.

01:22:27.132 --> 01:22:28.941
Get the fuck away from my sister.

01:22:29.001 --> 01:22:30.576
We did exactly what you asked.
Now get the fuck away from...

01:22:30.636 --> 01:22:33.145
Hey, hey. Calm the fuck down.
The fight's outside.

01:22:33.205 --> 01:22:35.881
You did your thing with the church group,
and we got your sister here.

01:22:35.941 --> 01:22:38.217
- You okay?
- Lucy, I'm really okay.

01:22:38.277 --> 01:22:39.919
It's really bad outside.

01:22:39.979 --> 01:22:40.986
We all just want to get out of here.

01:22:41.046 --> 01:22:42.488
Where's the big guy?

01:22:42.548 --> 01:22:43.956
Look. You guys can stand
around talking about nothing,

01:22:44.016 --> 01:22:45.124
but we're getting the fuck out of here.

01:22:45.184 --> 01:22:46.492
- Just give me a minute.
- Wait.

01:22:46.552 --> 01:22:47.893
You're wasting time. We're leaving.

01:22:47.953 --> 01:22:49.495
Come on!

01:22:49.555 --> 01:22:52.990
Lucy, what are you doing?

01:22:56.328 --> 01:22:59.171
Fuck me.

01:22:59.231 --> 01:23:02.099
Really? He's dead?

01:23:05.004 --> 01:23:06.979
That's some shit.

01:23:07.039 --> 01:23:08.848
We got to get out of here.

01:23:15.047 --> 01:23:16.614
Whoa.

01:23:17.983 --> 01:23:19.350
We're going.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.855
- Come on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:27.259 --> 01:23:29.068
Stay close to me.

01:23:33.465 --> 01:23:35.207
I'm so scared.

01:23:35.267 --> 01:23:37.209
I told you it was fucked up out here.

01:23:37.269 --> 01:23:38.477
Stay close to me.

01:23:38.537 --> 01:23:40.204
Okay, okay, okay. I'm here.

01:23:43.375 --> 01:23:46.344
There's so many people.
You can't even see anything.

01:23:49.214 --> 01:23:51.249
Let's get behind this.

01:23:52.685 --> 01:23:54.193
We're stuck.

01:23:54.253 --> 01:23:55.294
We're not going to be able to get through.

01:23:55.354 --> 01:23:57.129
- No, no, no.
- Lucy, let's go.

01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:58.564
They have a plan. We just have
to get to those helicopters.

01:23:58.624 --> 01:24:00.165
Where are they?

01:24:00.225 --> 01:24:02.167
They're right over there.

01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:06.672
- Stay near me.
- Okay.

01:24:16.342 --> 01:24:17.608
Whoa!

01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:21.186
Okay. Let's go.

01:24:45.004 --> 01:24:46.671
Don't lose me.

01:24:49.041 --> 01:24:50.649
Oh, shit.

01:24:55.047 --> 01:24:58.057
- Belinda, wait.
- Got you, bitch.

01:24:58.117 --> 01:24:59.625
Get the fuck off me.

01:25:02.221 --> 01:25:04.630
Come on. Come on. Get up. We got to move.

01:25:07.659 --> 01:25:09.327
Belinda?

01:25:14.466 --> 01:25:15.708
This way.

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:19.645
Okay.

01:25:19.705 --> 01:25:20.679
You're good. You're good. You're good.

01:25:20.739 --> 01:25:22.514
Okay.

01:25:22.574 --> 01:25:24.516
This way. This way. This way.

01:25:24.576 --> 01:25:27.353
- The gun's out.
- Drop it, drop it.

01:25:35.487 --> 01:25:37.730
Take his gun. Take his gun.

01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:39.190
Come on.

01:25:42.227 --> 01:25:44.303
Help me. Help me. Help me.

01:25:46.765 --> 01:25:48.840
Run and keep shooting!

01:25:55.474 --> 01:25:57.783
Yeah? Okay.

01:25:57.843 --> 01:25:59.685
Gonna get behind those barrels.

01:25:59.745 --> 01:26:02.246
Ready? Okay. Run.

01:26:03.082 --> 01:26:04.590
Run!

01:26:09.588 --> 01:26:11.263
You okay?

01:26:11.323 --> 01:26:12.598
We have to make it through there.

01:26:12.658 --> 01:26:13.766
What?

01:26:13.826 --> 01:26:16.135
No. Fuck. We're not gonna make it.

01:26:16.195 --> 01:26:18.337
Okay. We're gonna pull these. Are you ready?

01:26:18.397 --> 01:26:21.173
We're gonna pull these. One, two, three.

01:26:21.233 --> 01:26:22.808
- Throw it.
- Throw.

01:26:22.868 --> 01:26:25.110
Grenade! Grenade! Grenade!

01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.822
- Oh, look!
- We found it.

01:26:36.882 --> 01:26:38.757
We're almost in. The helicopters
are right over there.

01:26:38.817 --> 01:26:40.092
We got to get the fuck out of here.

01:26:40.152 --> 01:26:41.160
Oh, shit.

01:26:46.391 --> 01:26:48.167
I see the helicopter.

01:26:49.628 --> 01:26:51.637
Come on. We're so close.

01:26:54.766 --> 01:26:57.543
Everybody keep moving towards the chopper.

01:26:57.603 --> 01:26:59.144
Aah!

01:26:59.204 --> 01:27:00.512
Aah!

01:27:00.572 --> 01:27:01.713
Stay low.

01:27:05.711 --> 01:27:07.611
Belinda!

01:27:09.281 --> 01:27:12.191
Okay. I'm coming for you.

01:27:12.251 --> 01:27:14.293
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

01:27:14.353 --> 01:27:16.862
Aah! Aah!

01:27:16.922 --> 01:27:19.131
Aah!

01:27:19.191 --> 01:27:21.133
Oh. Fuck.

01:27:29.201 --> 01:27:31.143
Fuck. Okay. Can you walk?

01:27:31.203 --> 01:27:32.344
I can't.

01:27:32.404 --> 01:27:33.879
Okay, okay. I'm gonna pull you.

01:27:33.939 --> 01:27:35.347
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:27:35.407 --> 01:27:36.707
Okay. One.

01:27:38.277 --> 01:27:40.552
We're so close. We're so close.

01:27:40.612 --> 01:27:42.388
Lucy!

01:27:43.545 --> 01:27:45.858
Lucy, get up.

01:27:45.918 --> 01:27:47.292
Lucy.

01:28:08.307 --> 01:28:10.449
Come on.

01:28:10.509 --> 01:28:12.918
No!

01:28:12.978 --> 01:28:14.386
Come on, come on.

01:28:14.446 --> 01:28:16.622
- Get up.
- I won't leave her.

01:28:16.682 --> 01:28:18.223
We got to keep moving.

01:28:18.283 --> 01:28:20.026
No!

01:28:22.654 --> 01:28:24.663
No!

01:28:26.525 --> 01:28:29.426
