00:47.999 --> 00:50.639
I'm sorry guys, I wish I could've
come here with a better news.

00:50.909 --> 00:52.539
But, according to these projections.

00:52.749 --> 00:54.919
Reynholm Industries is
in a critical position.

00:55.919 --> 00:57.819
We took a major downturn last year.

00:58.029 --> 00:59.559
Like the rest of the economy.

01:00.039 --> 01:05.108
And as a result, we have estimated
losses at well of a Â£400 million.

01:05.309 --> 01:08.249
Before we go on, Linda.
Do you need to go to the toilet?

01:09.310 --> 01:09.770
No.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.980
Then why are you
doing a wee-wee walk?

01:12.810 --> 01:14.900
It's incredibly odd and distracting.

01:15.300 --> 01:19.250
- Maybe it's just me?
- No, is not just you Douglas. I also find it very distracting.

01:19.560 --> 01:20.470
Sorry Linda.

01:20.820 --> 01:21.870
Don't worry about it, Jen.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.660
It is not a wee-wee walk.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.629
I'm actualy doing Around-the-world
virtual-triathlon-for-charity, using...

01:27.630 --> 01:29.740
an iPhone application and Google Maps.

01:31.490 --> 01:32.610
Look, I'm in Spain.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.490
God, that's hugely impressive.

01:36.610 --> 01:38.180
Haven't you just had a baby?

01:38.280 --> 01:39.180
So they tell me.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.510
Ah, for God's sake.

01:46.970 --> 01:48.320
Sorry, did that sound like words?

01:50.010 --> 01:53.831
Now, do go on.
And congratulation on getting an iPhone.

01:55.401 --> 01:57.811
I say, we get in Silvio Bernatellii.

01:58.611 --> 01:59.911
Bernatelli?

02:00.151 --> 02:02.991
The most successfull
businessman of the year.

02:04.781 --> 02:09.571
Why a word from him
can make or break a business.

02:10.211 --> 02:13.001
Look, Reynholm Industries is in a tough spot.

02:13.151 --> 02:16.821
But with Bernatelli as investor?
I Think we can come out on top.

02:16.991 --> 02:18.821
This is very convincing, Linda.

02:18.961 --> 02:21.941
Damn good job.
Damn good bloody good damn good job.

02:23.141 --> 02:24.281
You're the best woman here.

02:24.631 --> 02:27.571
You, are an excellent woman.

02:30.731 --> 02:33.131
Linda! Bloody Linda.

02:33.231 --> 02:36.462
I'm so good at business things...
Reynholm Industries.

02:36.622 --> 02:39.092
God, do you have any idea
how annoying this woman is?

02:39.182 --> 02:40.182
I haven't inkling.

02:43.132 --> 02:45.012
I just had eureka moment.

02:45.412 --> 02:47.992
Why do I keep my phone
in my trousers pocket?

02:48.042 --> 02:49.832
It's to far...
but look at this...

02:50.132 --> 02:51.832
Top pocket.

02:52.972 --> 02:53.832
Yeah?

02:54.522 --> 02:55.832
Not as far...

02:57.382 --> 02:58.412
Yeah? look at that.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.202
See how smooth that is...
Oh, mama!

03:03.802 --> 03:04.662
Do you see that?

03:05.012 --> 03:06.332
You wish you saw that.

03:08.592 --> 03:10.121
Sorry, did I interrupt...

03:10.122 --> 03:12.452
- No
- She had a baby like yesterday, and she already...

03:12.453 --> 03:14.362
invading Spain.

03:14.892 --> 03:16.193
Linda just had a baby?

03:16.453 --> 03:18.173
Wow, well you'll never know...

03:19.053 --> 03:19.843
What?

03:20.453 --> 03:21.843
To much information.

03:22.353 --> 03:23.863
What? that she had a baby?

03:26.263 --> 03:26.963
Come on.

03:27.263 --> 03:29.703
Moss, It's a natural part of life.

03:29.983 --> 03:31.513
It's not a natural part
of my life...

03:31.963 --> 03:33.283
And I aim to keep it that way.

03:34.513 --> 03:35.823
You should be okay.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.073
What's that jacket for?

03:40.353 --> 03:43.233
It's not for anything, it was a
present, Julia got it for me.

03:44.123 --> 03:47.143
- How is Julia the orphan?
- Don't call her that.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.493
- Why?
- That's the first thing you told us about her.

03:49.723 --> 03:52.423
I totaly think of her
as Julia the orphan.

03:52.953 --> 03:55.323
Well, get out of the habbit of it.
What if it slip out...

03:55.324 --> 03:56.623
when you meet her in person?

03:56.624 --> 03:59.184
I'm hardly like to say
Hallo, Judy the Orphan, am I not?

03:59.724 --> 04:02.024
I totaly would say that to her.

04:02.654 --> 04:05.904
- Yeah, I know you would.
- But she still an orphan right?

04:06.644 --> 04:07.814
Yes!

04:07.954 --> 04:10.434
Her parents haven't
come back to life.

04:10.624 --> 04:13.604
Have you find out the story
of what happened to them?

04:13.974 --> 04:16.574
No, she doesn't really
like talking about it.

04:16.803 --> 04:19.224
Why not so be curious
like I would be?

04:19.434 --> 04:22.223
Yeah, you know what,
it's none of my business.

04:22.224 --> 04:23.694
Maybe they not really dead.

04:24.064 --> 04:28.414
Maybe she doesn't know what the word orphan means.
Maybe she thinks it just means...

04:28.894 --> 04:30.014
House-proud.

04:32.104 --> 04:33.964
I'm leaving now.

04:35.614 --> 04:37.544
- Roy?
- Yeah?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.784
What's that jacket for?

04:40.805 --> 04:42.125
It's not for anything.

04:42.435 --> 04:45.265
Will you be wearing that
all the time now?

04:45.665 --> 04:46.895
Yeah, maybe.

04:47.085 --> 04:49.545
Infact, Julia thinks
I can pull it of.

04:50.055 --> 04:52.215
- You don't like it?
- It's the worst thing ever.

04:52.965 --> 04:54.805
You look like a tall girl.

04:55.665 --> 04:57.405
Maybe a little feminin.

04:58.245 --> 05:00.315
I can understand why you
wouldn't like it then.

05:00.565 --> 05:01.585
What's that supposed to mean?

05:01.775 --> 05:03.145
Oh come on.
These Linda business...

05:03.146 --> 05:04.755
we got these, six or
seven times a week.

05:04.756 --> 05:07.125
It's always the same,
it's never about a man.

05:07.215 --> 05:08.305
You're just one of those woman...

05:08.306 --> 05:11.215
You're one of those woman,
who don't like women.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.215
Burn it.

05:17.325 --> 05:20.145
You should burn the jacket.

05:23.866 --> 05:25.955
And all these for Sport Relief.

05:25.956 --> 05:27.976
We all have to do our bit.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.726
First you made me
want to go to the toilet..

05:30.886 --> 05:33.276
And now you make me
want to be a better person.

05:34.416 --> 05:36.516
A bit of news on the Bernatelli
front, by the way, Douglas.

05:37.026 --> 05:39.116
His translator is sick.
So we have to hire one.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.115
I could translate if you want.

05:41.116 --> 05:42.906
Can you speak Italian, Jen?

05:46.466 --> 05:47.676
Very impressive.

05:55.806 --> 05:58.786
Not before I flush the toilet.
Thank you very much.

06:05.737 --> 06:08.177
Beautiful and
delicate young lady.

06:08.737 --> 06:10.456
- With such a butch hand.
- Oi...

06:10.457 --> 06:12.267
I'm kiding, I'm kidding.
You got a lovely hand.

06:12.268 --> 06:14.457
And that's a lovely ring.
I haven't notice that before.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.807
That was my mom's.

06:17.807 --> 06:21.246
Oh, I'm sorry Julia I didn't mean...
I know you don't want to talk about all this.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.917
- No, I'm sorry Roy.
- Yeah.

06:23.017 --> 06:26.597
I should just tell you the whole story,
because you gonna have to know sooner or later.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.897
If you dont mind,
I'd like to get it all out now.

06:30.107 --> 06:32.687
Just as long as we never
talk about it again.

06:35.247 --> 06:36.897
There was a fire.

06:37.547 --> 06:38.687
A fire?

06:38.917 --> 06:42.007
Oh, God. It's awful.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:42.407 --> 06:43.847
We were on holiday.

06:44.027 --> 06:45.796
We went to a Sea Parks.

06:45.797 --> 06:49.218
- You know, Sea Parks like the Sea World.
- Yeah, sure Sea Parks.

06:49.448 --> 06:52.638
It was... during the sea lion show.

06:56.308 --> 06:58.118
A fire...

06:59.608 --> 07:02.538
during the sea lion show...

07:04.608 --> 07:05.698
at Sea Parks.

07:09.068 --> 07:12.308
The flame surround us so quickly,
and we couldn't...

07:12.858 --> 07:14.838
We coulnd't...

07:15.768 --> 07:18.558
- Oh, are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.578
Just promise me,
we'll never talk about it again.

07:22.808 --> 07:25.438
Sure, sure. of course...

07:30.019 --> 07:33.069
- But, how the...
- I don't want to talk about it!

07:36.319 --> 07:37.809
You don't speak Italian?

07:40.159 --> 07:41.139
No.

07:42.949 --> 07:44.669
Why did you say you did?

07:45.999 --> 07:47.989
No one is paying attention to me.

07:49.109 --> 07:50.989
So what did you actualy
say at the meeting?

07:51.759 --> 07:53.299
I don't know.

07:57.949 --> 07:59.039
<i>Very impressive.</i>

08:05.759 --> 08:07.969
He wants me to do a
conference call with him.

08:08.479 --> 08:11.039
- What am I gonna do?
- All these lies, Jen.

08:11.830 --> 08:14.130
This is exactly what
happened with the Iraq war.

08:15.060 --> 08:19.360
It's not that much of a lie, Moss.
Because I have always wanted to speaks Italian...

08:19.410 --> 08:22.780
and I can sound like I'm
speaking Italian, so it's...

08:22.790 --> 08:25.030
more or less the same thing.

08:25.450 --> 08:30.750
Yeah, except to Italian.
Or people who can understand Italian.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.190
Exactly.

08:32.659 --> 08:34.190
Oh, God.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.539
I'm just gonna blue-sky this.

08:38.820 --> 08:41.419
Would it be of any help,
what so everr...

08:41.590 --> 08:44.910
If I were to install a voice activated
translation program on your laptop?

08:45.100 --> 08:47.470
No, Stupid idea!
Stupid idea.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.050
No, no, no, no.
A voice activated?

08:50.080 --> 08:53.520
Is that mean someone would speak and
the translation would appear on the computer screen?

08:53.610 --> 08:55.181
Actualy, now that you put it like that.

08:55.441 --> 08:56.661
That could work.

08:59.021 --> 09:00.121
Well done.

09:00.421 --> 09:02.121
Good idea, Jen.

09:03.131 --> 09:04.481
Thank you?

09:09.201 --> 09:09.931
The Jacket!

09:10.261 --> 09:11.931
He still wearing the jacket.

09:13.071 --> 09:14.121
You alright, Roy?

09:15.111 --> 09:16.121
Is it the jacket?

09:18.101 --> 09:18.991
Because, it should be.

09:21.981 --> 09:24.401
<i>- No. It's um...
- What?</i>

09:25.491 --> 09:26.891
Julia told me the story.

09:30.771 --> 09:31.951
So, what happened?

09:32.971 --> 09:34.461
Her parent died in a fire.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.462
Oh, God. I'm sorry,
that's horrible.

09:37.082 --> 09:39.272
Yeah, yeah, it was a fire.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.542
At Sea Parks.

09:47.272 --> 09:49.042
- Sea Parks?
- Yeah.

09:51.152 --> 09:53.622
- With the...
- With the whales and everything, yeah...

09:55.242 --> 09:56.212
Well, okay.

09:57.152 --> 09:59.342
- Sea Parks?
- Yeah.

10:11.032 --> 10:13.412
- A fire?
- That's right.

10:16.112 --> 10:18.323
At the sea lion show, apparently.

10:20.493 --> 10:22.933
Aren't those shows
usualy out in the open?

10:23.003 --> 10:25.643
Well, yeah, I mean
that's what I would've...

10:26.523 --> 10:28.893
- Yeah.
- Lots of water everywhere.

10:29.033 --> 10:31.683
Yeah, I mean, I would imagine
a whale need a lot of water.

10:32.593 --> 10:36.253
I don't think you can have whale in a place
where there isn't a huge amount of water.

10:37.983 --> 10:40.742
It just seem like a weird
place to go on fire.

10:40.743 --> 10:43.713
It's a very weird place
to go on fire.

10:43.883 --> 10:46.203
A fire?
At a Sea Parks?

10:46.573 --> 10:48.893
It's the weirdest thing
I've ever heard.

10:49.603 --> 10:51.053
Well, maybe...

10:51.953 --> 10:53.693
Maybe if there were plastic seats.

10:53.813 --> 10:56.563
- Maybe they could go..
- They don't have plastic seats at Sea Park.

10:57.113 --> 10:57.933
How do you know?

10:58.023 --> 10:59.453
Roy, when I was on holiday...

10:59.503 --> 11:01.264
I live at Sea Park.

11:01.764 --> 11:05.554
It's the Funnest, Wettest,
most splish-splashy, place in the world.

11:06.724 --> 11:09.964
Okay, did you go and see
the sea lion show?

11:10.114 --> 11:11.964
Three times a day,
for two weeks.

11:12.524 --> 11:15.064
- And do they have plastic...
- No, it's all stone steps.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.384
They won't went on fire.

11:18.434 --> 11:22.534
I've check wikipedia, there is no
mention of a fire at any Sea Parks.

11:22.804 --> 11:24.634
Do you think maybe she's lying?

11:24.954 --> 11:27.914
No, I mean, why would she lied?

11:28.284 --> 11:31.354
And if she was going to lie,
why would she used this one?

11:32.354 --> 11:34.674
A fire at a Sea Parks.

11:35.164 --> 11:36.674
It's wrecked in my head.

11:36.754 --> 11:41.584
I mean, if she has said that her parent are drowned,
I'd be the happiest man in the world.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.265
But, a fire?

11:43.365 --> 11:45.374
At a Sea Parks?

11:45.375 --> 11:47.215
Well, it's just...
It's just... oh...

11:47.715 --> 11:49.515
..it open up a lot of question..

11:50.565 --> 11:52.745
- Maybe, you could ask her?
- No, no, no, no.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.335
We can never talk about it again.

11:56.285 --> 11:58.225
- Well, maybe you could just...
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:58.226 --> 12:00.845
We can never talk about it
for the rest of our lifes.

12:01.765 --> 12:04.805
Well, I suppose you just going
to have to try stop thinking about it.

12:06.995 --> 12:09.505
That's another great idea.

12:10.305 --> 12:11.775
You're on fire.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.775
If you pardon the expression.

12:24.225 --> 12:26.676
I would be very happy
to come and have a look.

12:26.976 --> 12:29.496
<i>Next week, is good for me.</i>

12:29.656 --> 12:31.736
We're certainly looking
forward to your visit.

12:32.106 --> 12:35.746
<i>We can't wait to give you the full
Reynholm Industries experience.</i>

12:48.596 --> 12:50.756
He says he's looking
forward to meeting me.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.636
<i>Ciao.</i>

12:59.796 --> 13:01.376
Maybe, you're the best woman.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.032
Twelve exits.

13:12.133 --> 13:14.292
There are twelve exits.

13:14.922 --> 13:16.293
What are you doing?

13:17.913 --> 13:20.522
- What?
- What are you doing on the computer?

13:22.392 --> 13:23.262
Masturbating.

13:55.662 --> 13:57.882
Isn't Bernatelli today?
Shouldn't you be preparing?

13:58.822 --> 14:00.151
No, I think I'm okay, Moss.

14:00.152 --> 14:01.891
I've learn a few conversational basics...

14:01.921 --> 14:04.902
so when he gets going,
I just fire up this baby.

14:05.652 --> 14:09.290
I do wanna feel refreshed though,
at the meeting, so I'm gonna to sleep...

14:09.291 --> 14:11.292
for a few hours.

14:16.541 --> 14:17.952
Is that what you having for lunch?

14:18.231 --> 14:19.951
A big pile of mashed potatoes.

14:20.941 --> 14:21.952
I fancy it.

14:24.412 --> 14:26.171
It's a Sea Parks, isn't it?

14:27.072 --> 14:29.341
You're building a Sea Parks
out of mashed potatoes.

14:32.402 --> 14:34.022
There are twelve exits, Moss.

14:34.421 --> 14:37.061
Twelve exits!
For only 200 people.

14:37.932 --> 14:40.221
You don't close encounters crazy, Roy.

14:40.602 --> 14:42.982
- You need to let it go.
- To have killed anyone...

14:43.042 --> 14:45.931
the fire has to start,
here, here, and here.

14:46.322 --> 14:47.930
And close in like this.

14:47.931 --> 14:49.441
But, how is it spreaded?

14:49.691 --> 14:51.871
There is no wood
in a Sea Parks arena.

14:52.271 --> 14:53.591
And why there is no wood?

14:53.841 --> 14:55.241
Because it's rots.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.781
And why does it's rots?

14:56.861 --> 14:59.281
Because of all the water...

15:02.760 --> 15:04.311
Damn, that mash look tasty.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.431
Password?

15:13.191 --> 15:14.961
It didn't asked for password before...

15:15.441 --> 15:16.961
Moss?

15:18.281 --> 15:19.401
Where's Moss?

15:19.501 --> 15:21.861
It's payday, he's probably go to Namco.

15:29.460 --> 15:30.711
Where's Namco?

15:36.391 --> 15:38.981
It's an iPhone, there's flipping
iPhone in the flipping machine.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.610
I run out of coin.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.961
Moss!

15:56.781 --> 15:57.730
Moss.

16:02.471 --> 16:03.931
What am I gonna do.

16:18.130 --> 16:19.800
What are you..

16:20.090 --> 16:21.800
How did you get in there?

16:22.239 --> 16:23.799
Through the hole.

16:26.229 --> 16:27.590
Why?

16:27.769 --> 16:30.430
There's an iPhone, Jen.
An actual iPhone.

16:30.801 --> 16:32.770
I need your password,
I need the password...

16:32.771 --> 16:34.500
..for the translations program.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.010
Help me get the iPhone first.

16:36.140 --> 16:38.280
- I can't lift my arms.
- No.

16:38.380 --> 16:41.420
I need to get it through the shoots,
someone else will take it if you don't.

16:41.469 --> 16:44.249
I'm sure they're not giving it away,
the enginer must've droped it.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.769
No, no, no, It's the price.
It's the price, you got to help me.

16:46.770 --> 16:49.910
- I don't have time.
- But, it's an IPhone, Jen.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.128
I may able to get an iPhone without
giving any money to Apple.

16:53.129 --> 16:54.910
I'll be living the dreams.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.680
What's the password?

16:56.909 --> 16:58.499
Moss, the password.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.030
Moss!

17:00.449 --> 17:01.609
Moss!

17:01.610 --> 17:05.128
Oh, I'm so excited about
the sea lion show.

17:07.239 --> 17:10.029
Ladies and gentleman,
please welcome...

17:10.128 --> 17:11.829
Luigi...

17:12.079 --> 17:13.839
Joe...

17:13.839 --> 17:15.990
..and, Slippery Pete.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.138
Oh, no. Whats all these smoke?

17:23.989 --> 17:25.398
What smoke?

17:25.950 --> 17:27.138
Oh, yeah, smoke...

17:38.059 --> 17:38.879
Where is it?

17:39.629 --> 17:41.099
There must be blocking it.

17:41.319 --> 17:43.439
I'll try to move to
clear the passage.

17:52.869 --> 17:54.350
Come on, Moss.

17:56.069 --> 17:57.159
Come on, Moss.
You can do it.

17:57.729 --> 17:58.909
Push

18:00.000 --> 18:01.099
Come on, Moss.

18:01.909 --> 18:03.099
Keep breathing.

18:03.439 --> 18:05.299
- Push!
- Shut up!

18:05.459 --> 18:06.819
You can do it, Moss.

18:07.099 --> 18:09.038
- I hate you!
- Why are saying that?

18:09.138 --> 18:11.159
I don't know!
Stop talking!

18:12.109 --> 18:13.379
Come on, Moss.

18:13.549 --> 18:16.019
Come on. That's it.

18:16.309 --> 18:19.229
It's coming... I can see,
I can see the start button

18:20.748 --> 18:21.969
Come on, Moss, push.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.878
One, two, three... Push!

18:25.969 --> 18:28.018

Push!

18:28.389 --> 18:29.728

It's beautiful.

18:41.719 --> 18:42.969
Password!

18:47.699 --> 18:48.838
Where the hell have you been?

18:48.888 --> 18:50.179
Sorry, it's just...

18:50.438 --> 18:51.278
Doesn't matter.

18:51.348 --> 18:54.038
So far, he satisfied
with Jen we laugh at.

18:58.628 --> 19:00.818
Mr. Bernatelli, meet Jen.

19:13.197 --> 19:15.047
Leave that laptop outside.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.047
- No. What?
- We have to think about security, Jen.

19:18.048 --> 19:21.698
How do we know that laptop, isn't
somehow able to connect to the internet?

19:23.258 --> 19:26.648
- No, no. It is a...
- Then get it out of here!

19:31.198 --> 19:34.438
Look, look at this, look how
long it takes to go on fire.

19:34.788 --> 19:37.128
And these made of matches.

19:38.078 --> 19:41.908
First of all, I like to extend the
warmest welcome to Mr. Bernatelli.

19:42.307 --> 19:45.777
And how today, is the begining
of a long and fruitful partnership.

20:13.897 --> 20:16.958
He said, It's a pleasure to be here.

20:19.647 --> 20:20.597
I see, so...

20:20.598 --> 20:23.007
If the fire start here,

20:23.337 --> 20:24.337
and they were there,

20:24.428 --> 20:26.397
and there's no way the could've escape.

20:26.398 --> 20:28.717
So, they must've been there.

20:32.457 --> 20:33.967
I should stop it.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.696
Aw, my hands!

20:50.947 --> 20:54.897
I have always wanted to visit England.

20:58.007 --> 21:02.766
I'm looking forward to something.
Some of your famous english food.

21:03.606 --> 21:05.527
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.

21:13.126 --> 21:16.317
- So, what are you wanna talk about?
- Alright, now you listen to me, Bernatelli.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.016
I hope by the end of this meeting
we could become friend friends

21:23.256 --> 21:26.007
I like you, and I like what
you've done with your company.

21:28.437 --> 21:30.067
Hopely we can join forces,

21:30.107 --> 21:32.307
and plow away through
each uncertain times.

21:37.387 --> 21:38.426
What do you say?

21:38.656 --> 21:41.216
Bernatelli and Reynholm Industries.

21:41.297 --> 21:43.526
Together will be bigger than ever.

21:50.326 --> 21:53.226
Hey, I'm gonna stand up,
and start talking slightly louder.

21:56.286 --> 21:57.676
Do you like my suit or not?

21:59.455 --> 22:01.586
The woman to my left,
smell likes she's been for a run

22:04.846 --> 22:07.367
This meeting is going better
than you might think.

22:13.646 --> 22:16.616
I love what you have
done with this office.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.246
Can I borrow some
of your erotic arts?

22:20.986 --> 22:21.766
For how long?

22:33.615 --> 22:36.965
On second thoughts,
I'm gonna go.

22:37.785 --> 22:40.315
Never contact me again,
because I'm mental.

22:42.585 --> 22:44.355
Well, that's a waste of time.

22:45.345 --> 22:48.895
Next time you have a bright idea, Linda.
Keep it to yourself.

22:48.896 --> 22:51.656
- But...
- Oh, for God's sake, get a shower.

22:56.315 --> 22:57.755
- Oh, my god, Roy.
- Oh, ya...

22:59.445 --> 23:00.995
Oh, my God, you poor thing.

23:01.245 --> 23:02.765
Your hands...

23:03.106 --> 23:04.675
How did they happen?

23:07.795 --> 23:09.385
It's kind of hard to explain.

23:09.565 --> 23:11.845
- But, what...
- I don't want to talk about it.

23:19.145 --> 23:20.225
Moss!

23:22.285 --> 23:23.085
Hallo...

23:25.504 --> 23:26.374
Hallo...

23:28.084 --> 23:30.584
starting to get pretty lonely now.

23:41.865 --> 23:44.985
These toys may smell of wee.
Count them all.
