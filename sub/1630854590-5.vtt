00:59.884 --> 01:01.319
Morning, Mrs. Dutton.

01:01.319 --> 01:03.221
Morning, Mabel.

01:06.991 --> 01:09.760
Hmm. Can't get
here soon enough.

01:16.834 --> 01:18.669
No cable?

01:18.669 --> 01:20.304
Not today.

01:20.304 --> 01:22.607
If one comes,
I'll send Steven with it.

01:22.607 --> 01:24.408
At least spare you
the carriage ride.

01:24.408 --> 01:25.776
Then I'll be waiting
for a man

01:25.776 --> 01:28.846
who never comes
instead of a cable.

01:28.846 --> 01:31.649
The carriage allows me
to remove hope early,

01:31.649 --> 01:33.818
so I can get on with my day.

01:52.670 --> 01:55.840
Okay.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.314
Come on.

02:03.314 --> 02:06.384
<i>Life had become a series
of melancholy routines.</i>

02:11.489 --> 02:13.791
<i>Like a defeated stag that
had retreated deep</i>

02:13.791 --> 02:16.427
<i>into the forest
to tend its wounds...</i>

02:36.781 --> 02:40.451
<i>Our family had lost itself
in the tedium of healing.</i>

03:24.195 --> 03:28.132
<i>The hobby of watching young
love had been robbed from her,</i>

03:28.132 --> 03:30.501
<i>Jack choosing to spend
his evenings</i>

03:30.501 --> 03:34.505
<i>patrolling headquarters,
choosing revenge over passion.</i>

03:54.959 --> 03:57.895
I've sent for the doctor.

03:57.895 --> 03:59.397
What for?

03:59.397 --> 04:00.931
For you.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.836
I'll not spoon feed
and bathe two, Emma...

04:05.836 --> 04:08.472
You have a child,
he needs you.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.876
He is a man.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.145
Who has a woman.

04:14.145 --> 04:16.113
He has no need for me.

04:16.113 --> 04:19.050
Sons outgrow their
mothers, now, do they?

04:20.217 --> 04:22.119
Become a mother
before you lecture me

04:22.119 --> 04:23.921
about sons and what they do.

04:42.039 --> 04:45.443
<i>A billion years of life
led to my family standing</i>

04:45.443 --> 04:47.345
<i>in the mountains of Montana.</i>

04:48.612 --> 04:50.948
<i>And only four Duttons
remained on this earth</i>

04:50.948 --> 04:52.650
<i>to survive another generation.</i>

04:55.786 --> 04:57.555
<i>We were going extinct.</i>

05:16.207 --> 05:18.476
When we get to port,
stay close.

05:18.476 --> 05:20.845
I came through Mombasa,
it was fine.

05:20.845 --> 05:23.347
You came with a group
and your drivers waiting.

05:23.347 --> 05:24.815
We have neither.

05:26.350 --> 05:27.351
Stay close.

05:29.787 --> 05:33.190
<i>Our family
is condemned to journey.</i>

05:33.190 --> 05:36.360
<i>Journey from Ireland
to escape poverty.</i>

05:37.995 --> 05:41.999
<i>Journey from Tennessee
to escape war.</i>

05:41.999 --> 05:44.702
<i>Journey from Kentucky
to offer salvation.</i>

05:46.170 --> 05:50.408
<i>Journey from Africa
to seek vengeance.</i>

05:58.048 --> 06:00.918
<i>Montana is the magnet now.</i>

06:00.918 --> 06:02.787
<i>It is the next journey.</i>

06:04.688 --> 06:08.826
<i>And for my young brother,
it will be his last.</i>

06:27.478 --> 06:29.346
Thank you.

06:29.346 --> 06:31.482
When you come back, Spencer?

06:31.482 --> 06:33.717
I don't come back.

06:33.717 --> 06:36.287
This is goodbye.

06:36.287 --> 06:39.223
Last ride for
a friend is free.

06:39.223 --> 06:41.192
Thank you.

06:44.128 --> 06:47.198
You said stay close. Ow.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.401
Let's go.

07:45.689 --> 07:47.358
I need to book
passage to America.

07:47.358 --> 07:50.227
America? And how do you
expect to do that?

07:50.227 --> 07:51.695
You tell me.

07:51.695 --> 07:53.531
We have no liners
to the States.

07:53.531 --> 07:55.466
I can book you to London.

07:55.466 --> 07:57.334
You can arrange transport
from there.

07:57.334 --> 07:58.569
Book me to London.

07:58.569 --> 07:59.737
Which class of travel?

07:59.737 --> 08:01.605
The cheapest.

08:01.605 --> 08:03.841
First class is
forty pounds per passenger.

08:03.841 --> 08:06.377
It's thirty for tourist class,

08:06.377 --> 08:08.679
but the lady will
melt beneath the bow,

08:08.679 --> 08:10.714
while you will war
with the rats, sir.

08:10.714 --> 08:12.783
And I do not refer to rodents.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.451
First class, then.

08:14.451 --> 08:15.886
How long is the journey?

08:15.886 --> 08:17.488
Depends on traffic
at the Suez.

08:17.488 --> 08:19.256
A month, give or take...

08:19.256 --> 08:21.559
Your vessel
is the RMS Franconia.

08:21.559 --> 08:23.260
You will embark on...

08:23.260 --> 08:24.762
November 11th.

08:24.762 --> 08:26.897
That's three weeks.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.766
I can't wait three weeks.

08:28.766 --> 08:31.235
What's another option?

08:31.235 --> 08:33.237
I don't know.
We're gonna have to find out.

08:38.375 --> 08:39.944
There are no
other options, sir.

10:37.761 --> 10:39.263
Summon the girls.

11:14.998 --> 11:16.233
Where did she go?

11:18.969 --> 11:20.070
I don't... I don't know.

11:23.707 --> 11:25.109
If you don't know,
why are you crying?

11:28.846 --> 11:31.482
What have the
innocent to fear?

11:31.482 --> 11:36.186
Fear is the stench
of guilt, child.

11:36.186 --> 11:39.189
And you reek of it.

11:40.858 --> 11:42.092
Where did she go?

11:44.495 --> 11:45.529
I don't know.

11:47.631 --> 11:49.066
I don't know!

12:06.683 --> 12:12.356
When you do not tell
the truth, you aid a sinner.

12:13.791 --> 12:18.896
To aid a sinner
is a sin itself, child.

12:21.665 --> 12:26.370
To aid a murderer is to bathe
in the blood of her victims.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.739
I told you... truth.

12:30.841 --> 12:33.410
She went home.

12:37.014 --> 12:38.682
Walking...

12:38.682 --> 12:40.617
Four hundred miles...

12:40.617 --> 12:44.254
Through badlands
and desert and canyons...

12:44.254 --> 12:45.789
With no assistance.

12:45.789 --> 12:47.257
No supplies...

12:48.325 --> 12:50.327
You expect me to
accept that as fact?

12:53.163 --> 12:55.732
You have strayed
from the light.

12:55.732 --> 12:58.402
Forsaken it.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.704
The devil runs you now.

13:00.704 --> 13:03.140
You are his marionette.

13:03.140 --> 13:09.279
He works your filthy mouth
with his little strings.

13:09.279 --> 13:13.984
You will tell me the truth
or I will deliver you to him.

14:55.059 --> 14:56.360
Bring her back to me.

19:27.698 --> 19:30.134
- It's just you?
- My bride.

19:30.134 --> 19:32.136
Bride...
A woman.

19:32.136 --> 19:35.439
Mister, this...
this ship is a trawler.

19:35.439 --> 19:37.741
The quarters, they are...

19:37.741 --> 19:41.311
They deck hands, they are...
they are deck hands.

19:41.311 --> 19:43.847
A woman on board? No.

19:43.847 --> 19:45.549
Is she pretty?

19:45.549 --> 19:47.384
She'll take your breath away.

19:47.384 --> 19:48.719
Are you crazy?

19:48.719 --> 19:50.053
No.

19:50.053 --> 19:51.155
They will throw you overboard

19:51.155 --> 19:52.823
and keep the woman
for themselves. No.

19:59.396 --> 20:01.231
I have idea for you.

20:01.231 --> 20:03.467
That old man.

20:03.467 --> 20:06.069
He is transporting
a tug to the Suez.

20:06.069 --> 20:08.772
Once you get to the Suez you
can get passage to anywhere.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.041
He is looking for deck hands.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.777
Ever worked a deck?

20:13.777 --> 20:15.179
No.

20:16.513 --> 20:19.349
Better you lie. Say yes.

20:20.484 --> 20:22.486
Come.

20:25.689 --> 20:27.057
Lucca!

20:28.792 --> 20:32.896
Lucca, you found
any sailors yet?

20:32.896 --> 20:36.400
No, nobody wants
to transport a tug.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.604
All the money is on the merchant
ships and whalers.

20:40.604 --> 20:42.139
Well, I have one for you here.

20:46.310 --> 20:48.779
Looks like a hunter.

20:48.779 --> 20:51.782
I need transport to a port
that gets me to Britain.

20:51.782 --> 20:54.685
I can pay.

20:54.685 --> 20:56.787
And I'm willing to work.

20:56.787 --> 20:58.555
How much you want to pay?

20:58.555 --> 21:01.225
Cruise liners charge 30.
I'll pay you that.

21:01.225 --> 21:04.328
Thirty pounds to swab deck
and stow gear?

21:07.397 --> 21:10.868
All right.
You got a deal.

21:12.102 --> 21:13.837
We leave first light.

21:13.837 --> 21:16.540
Harbor nine, slip 52.

21:19.209 --> 21:20.477
Mustard gas.

21:24.448 --> 21:25.549
How do you know that?

21:25.549 --> 21:30.254
Used to captain a liner
made into a hospital.

21:30.254 --> 21:33.690
Bring the boys on
hit with that mustard.

21:35.559 --> 21:37.761
Once you seen them boys...

21:37.761 --> 21:39.630
There's no unseeing it.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.899
You just know it
when you look at it.

21:44.067 --> 21:47.170
Mr. Hunter...

21:47.170 --> 21:49.473
Tomorrow we're gonna make
a sailor out of you.

23:56.066 --> 23:57.634
Your father is Runs his Horse.

24:01.838 --> 24:03.040
Hank.

24:06.143 --> 24:08.912
Hank. Why Hank?

24:08.912 --> 24:11.515
When they made us
choose names,

24:11.515 --> 24:14.684
everybody was
choosing George or Jim.

24:14.684 --> 24:17.821
Nobody was choosing Hank
so I chose it.

24:21.725 --> 24:23.660
This isn't part of the Rez.

24:23.660 --> 24:25.429
Ain't part of nothing.

24:25.429 --> 24:26.997
That's why I'm here.

24:26.997 --> 24:29.466
That doesn't make sense.

24:29.466 --> 24:31.902
The sheep belong
to the people.

24:31.902 --> 24:34.704
If the government finds
out we got 'em,

24:34.704 --> 24:37.474
the government's gonna take 'em.

24:37.474 --> 24:38.842
Why would they take 'em?

24:40.310 --> 24:41.845
Why would they take <i>you?</i>

24:51.388 --> 24:53.323
I'm in big trouble.

24:55.926 --> 24:59.229
I killed the nun who beat me,

25:00.931 --> 25:03.166
and I killed the nun
who raped me.

25:05.102 --> 25:07.337
Now they're gonna come
and kill me.

25:12.809 --> 25:16.546
I beat 'em...

25:16.546 --> 25:18.615
choked one
and stabbed the other.

25:37.801 --> 25:38.935
They did this?

25:42.339 --> 25:43.874
I'd say they had it coming.

25:48.712 --> 25:50.714
You come home with me.

25:50.714 --> 25:52.949
I'll send word to your father.

25:56.153 --> 25:58.488
Maybe we should
go to Canada.

25:58.488 --> 26:00.524
No Canada.

26:00.524 --> 26:02.125
Canada's worse.

26:04.227 --> 26:08.465
First we find your father,
then we find a place.

26:38.161 --> 26:39.729
What about our tracks?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.868
What tracks?

26:58.397 --> 27:00.499
It's incredible.

27:04.736 --> 27:06.371
This yours?

27:06.371 --> 27:09.074
It belongs to the bank.

27:10.208 --> 27:13.745
Strafford widow packed up.
Headed east.

27:13.745 --> 27:16.515
That ranch borders
the Yellowstone.

27:16.515 --> 27:18.050
Goes into the mountains?

27:18.050 --> 27:20.752
More mountain land
than the Yellowstone.

27:20.752 --> 27:22.487
I don't know know much
about mines,

27:22.487 --> 27:25.490
but if I was building one...

27:26.858 --> 27:28.126
I'd build it there.

27:30.262 --> 27:32.964
Spring creeks
through both canyons.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.068
See here?

27:40.272 --> 27:43.241
Headwaters, here.

27:43.241 --> 27:46.178
Another one here...

27:46.178 --> 27:49.314
Feed down
into the Yellowstone.

27:49.314 --> 27:51.950
- And to the south is the Park.
- Aye.

27:54.119 --> 27:56.354
And she abandoned it.

27:58.490 --> 27:59.725
Walked away.

27:59.725 --> 28:03.528
It's the bank's now, too,
I'm sure.

28:03.528 --> 28:05.697
All these ranchers
leveraged their land

28:05.697 --> 28:08.567
to build up their herds.

28:08.567 --> 28:11.770
Only way to make money off cows
now is steal 'em.

28:13.505 --> 28:17.309
Get me more of these.
Anyone you can run off.

28:18.410 --> 28:21.379
We'll choke this Dutton out.

28:21.379 --> 28:23.482
How much land do you want?

28:23.482 --> 28:24.683
I want it all.

28:27.953 --> 28:30.655
I want the whole valley.

28:57.349 --> 28:58.650
Where do you feed the wood?

28:58.650 --> 29:00.118
It runs on gas.

29:00.118 --> 29:02.254
Gas from where?

29:02.254 --> 29:04.022
It's piped into the house.

29:12.230 --> 29:14.566
Where do you live, Banner?

29:14.566 --> 29:17.536
I've a homestead up north
in the mountains.

29:17.536 --> 29:18.804
Log and sod?

29:20.505 --> 29:24.109
- Aye.
- Never lived in a city.

29:24.109 --> 29:25.477
Never.

29:29.314 --> 29:31.550
In the country,
you survive your surroundings,

29:31.550 --> 29:34.419
or try to, anyway.

29:34.419 --> 29:37.889
It's the most a man can muster
when he abandons civilization.

29:40.158 --> 29:43.395
Cities are the mastery
one's surroundings.

29:55.273 --> 29:58.577
Necessities become comforts.

29:58.577 --> 30:00.378
In the wild, the availability
of water

30:00.378 --> 30:02.614
dictates whether you
survived the day.

30:04.082 --> 30:05.317
In the city...

30:08.220 --> 30:10.455
That most precious
of resources...

30:12.991 --> 30:14.659
becomes an afterthought.

30:16.361 --> 30:18.230
No more log and sod for you.

30:19.764 --> 30:21.299
It's yours.

30:23.068 --> 30:25.003
Now you're a master, too.

31:04.976 --> 31:08.580
Hard to build a herd when
you sell all the heifers.

31:08.580 --> 31:12.817
We ain't building it.
We're shrinking it.

31:12.817 --> 31:15.353
Everybody's getting out.

31:15.353 --> 31:17.589
Never thought I'd see the day.

31:17.589 --> 31:19.457
Heard some of your hands
went off to Hollywood

31:19.457 --> 31:23.962
with them Strafford boys to play
cowboy in the silent pictures.

31:23.962 --> 31:25.497
That your plan, too?

31:29.234 --> 31:31.736
They can play cowboy
all they want.

31:31.736 --> 31:33.438
I'll stick to
doing it for real.

31:33.438 --> 31:34.973
You keep selling off your herd

31:34.973 --> 31:36.908
you ain't gonna have
nuthin' to cowboy with.

31:39.778 --> 31:42.380
Take that to the cashier,
she'll pay you out.

32:06.371 --> 32:08.640
What happened?

32:08.640 --> 32:10.375
Doctor says he needs sunlight.

32:51.583 --> 32:53.418
Look how angry you are.

32:54.786 --> 32:56.554
Brewsters sold out.

32:56.554 --> 32:58.923
Straffords are gone.
My parents gone...

32:58.923 --> 33:01.026
You're goddamn right I'm angry.

33:01.026 --> 33:04.696
We can't win...

33:04.696 --> 33:06.898
No leader.

33:08.466 --> 33:10.268
Can't win without a leader.

33:10.268 --> 33:12.937
I can lead 'em.

33:12.937 --> 33:14.672
They won't follow you.

33:14.672 --> 33:17.742
Not yet.

33:17.742 --> 33:19.844
This must be done right.

33:19.844 --> 33:21.379
Or we lose everything.

33:35.693 --> 33:36.895
You got old.

33:38.596 --> 33:40.765
I've <i>been</i> old, son.

33:48.306 --> 33:51.409
Guess I'm gonna have to learn
how to shoot left-handed.

33:54.446 --> 33:56.247
Fuckers got me
pretty good, huh?

33:58.983 --> 34:00.151
We're gonna get them back.

34:16.167 --> 34:18.136
He's taking it pretty hard.

34:18.136 --> 34:20.171
It's cost him
more than anyone.

34:21.573 --> 34:23.608
Keep him close.

34:23.608 --> 34:25.677
Don't let him go
to town anymore.

34:29.581 --> 34:32.150
Did you start hiring
livestock agents?

34:32.150 --> 34:35.053
Sheriff has
started interviewing.

34:35.053 --> 34:38.723
No. You gotta do it.

34:38.723 --> 34:41.392
You gotta look 'em in the eye.

34:41.392 --> 34:43.862
Don't trust the charming ones.

34:43.862 --> 34:45.864
Charming ones work for him.

34:49.501 --> 34:52.036
If he's smart, he's got
somebody to back him.

34:54.506 --> 34:56.808
Someone with money.

34:56.808 --> 34:58.776
Why do you think that?

34:58.776 --> 35:01.179
'Cause that's what I'd do,

35:01.179 --> 35:03.848
if I was in his spot.

35:03.848 --> 35:05.984
I find it hard to
believe that anyone

35:05.984 --> 35:08.553
would support that monster.

35:08.553 --> 35:12.557
It'd take another
monster, that's for sure.

35:14.292 --> 35:17.962
Who's the one man
in this state

35:17.962 --> 35:22.100
benefits if the ranchers
move out?

35:24.402 --> 35:29.140
What's the one business that
doesn't have recessions?

35:30.608 --> 35:31.843
Gold.

35:35.413 --> 35:37.849
You can start on solid
foods tomorrow.

35:37.849 --> 35:40.418
Oatmeal. Rice.

35:40.418 --> 35:42.520
Bland.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.989
Have some of your cowboys
help you walk.

35:44.989 --> 35:46.791
You need to start moving.

35:46.791 --> 35:47.992
I'll check on you next week.

35:53.765 --> 35:56.701
Cowboys don't get
to see me like this.

35:56.701 --> 35:58.303
I'll help you.

35:59.837 --> 36:02.006
You're gonna have to
'cause they're leaving.

36:02.006 --> 36:06.244
You've lost enough weight,
I bet I can carry you myself.

36:08.146 --> 36:09.881
Guess we'll find out.

36:24.762 --> 36:27.465
This isn't what you promised.

36:27.465 --> 36:29.901
You haven't lost anything
that I haven't lost.

36:29.901 --> 36:31.536
I'm an orphan too, now.

36:31.536 --> 36:34.606
And all we have is each other
and I don't even have that.

36:34.606 --> 36:37.842
Our wedding day came and
went with no mention of it.

36:37.842 --> 36:40.812
We don't...
We don't speak.

36:40.812 --> 36:43.881
You don't even touch me.

36:43.881 --> 36:46.284
I've got just as much
right to hate the man as you do,

36:46.284 --> 36:47.652
but I don't.

36:47.652 --> 36:50.321
Because hate takes
your whole heart,

36:50.321 --> 36:52.490
every bit of it.

36:52.490 --> 36:54.525
It leaves no room for love.

36:56.861 --> 36:57.962
I choose not to hate him,

36:57.962 --> 36:59.931
so there's room in
my heart for you.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.603
If you won't do the same for me,
then take me to town.

37:07.972 --> 37:09.474
Send me home, Jack.

37:36.367 --> 37:38.336
Look at the size
of this prison.

37:39.103 --> 37:40.972
That's what I'm in, Jack.

37:40.972 --> 37:42.140
No, you're not.

37:42.140 --> 37:44.008
It's a prison.

37:44.008 --> 37:46.377
You have made this
place a prison.

37:46.377 --> 37:50.581
It's not a prison.
It's not.

37:50.581 --> 37:54.485
It's home.
It's your home.

37:54.485 --> 37:56.421
I am your husband.

37:56.421 --> 37:57.855
Not yet, you aren't.

38:02.860 --> 38:04.629
We don't need a wedding
to get married.

38:06.464 --> 38:07.598
We don't need a church.

38:08.833 --> 38:10.835
We're standing in front
of God right now.

38:17.642 --> 38:20.578
I, Jack Dutton, take you,

38:20.578 --> 38:24.048
Liz Strafford, to be my
lawfully wedded wife.

38:25.083 --> 38:27.285
To have and to hold,

38:27.285 --> 38:30.488
in sickness and in health,

38:30.488 --> 38:32.824
for richer and for poorer...

38:32.824 --> 38:35.159
For better or worse,

38:35.159 --> 38:36.961
so long
as we both shall live--

38:50.508 --> 38:52.210
We're only half done.

38:53.244 --> 38:54.879
You gotta say it back.

39:05.490 --> 39:07.258
Sun feels good.

39:08.860 --> 39:10.762
How does some rice sound?

39:10.762 --> 39:12.397
Sounds like shit.

39:13.965 --> 39:16.200
Don't we have a
steak in the ice box?

39:16.200 --> 39:19.237
Mm, mm, mm.
Doctor said--

39:19.237 --> 39:22.206
If nine bullets don't kill
me I doubt a steak will.

39:22.206 --> 39:24.041
I'll boil a chicken.

39:24.041 --> 39:25.243
With rice...

39:25.243 --> 39:28.446
He said rice,
you're having rice.

39:28.446 --> 39:29.981
Chicken and rice.

39:31.315 --> 39:33.017
That's nobody's last meal.

39:34.318 --> 39:35.620
Exactly.

40:45.998 --> 40:47.700
Did you plan
on leaving a note?

40:49.402 --> 40:50.803
It's on the dresser.

40:57.309 --> 40:58.611
What does it say?

41:01.547 --> 41:03.215
Says that this trip
is too dangerous.

41:04.650 --> 41:07.820
Envelope has money so you can
book passage back to London.

41:07.820 --> 41:09.755
Says I'll send for
you when it's safe.

41:11.991 --> 41:12.992
Says a lot.

41:18.697 --> 41:22.334
There is no sending
for me, Spencer.

41:22.334 --> 41:26.839
We have a life together
or we live our lives apart.

41:28.541 --> 41:30.576
Can you do that?

41:30.576 --> 41:32.445
Can you live your
life without me?

41:42.955 --> 41:44.824
You only get
to choose me once.

41:46.992 --> 41:49.061
The choice will not
be offered again.

41:57.970 --> 41:59.105
Get your things.

42:23.095 --> 42:25.865
Did you send a wire?

42:25.865 --> 42:29.168
Telling them
you're coming home.

42:29.168 --> 42:30.903
Can't send a wire
to the States from here.

42:33.072 --> 42:35.374
Ships can.

42:35.374 --> 42:36.909
They have radios that
can send signals

42:36.909 --> 42:38.410
a thousand miles or more.

42:38.410 --> 42:40.279
I toured the helm
on our passage.

42:40.279 --> 42:41.847
The Captain showed me how
they send messages

42:41.847 --> 42:46.619
from ship to ship
until they reach London.

42:46.619 --> 42:48.821
From London, they can wire
anywhere in the States.

43:26.492 --> 43:29.728
You need permission
to board this ship, sir.

43:29.728 --> 43:30.829
Apologies.

43:32.231 --> 43:35.201
Passage may be booked at the
Union Castle office on Hudson--

43:35.201 --> 43:37.036
I don't need passage.

43:37.036 --> 43:38.437
I need a favor.

43:40.139 --> 43:43.108
My family in the United States
has suffered a tragedy.

43:43.108 --> 43:46.011
I must return home.
With haste.

43:46.011 --> 43:49.848
I'm leaving today
and I need to send word.

43:49.848 --> 43:53.252
Could you use the radio
and send a message for me?

43:58.057 --> 44:00.159
I can send that message.

44:00.159 --> 44:02.995
We'll need the recipient's name
and where to send the cable.

44:10.069 --> 44:11.237
Write it here, sir.

44:11.237 --> 44:12.805
And the message.

44:33.592 --> 44:35.361
- Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

44:42.434 --> 44:44.837
Why are you smiling?

44:44.837 --> 44:47.273
I'm extraordinarily
pleased with myself.

44:47.273 --> 44:49.174
You should be smiling too.

44:49.174 --> 44:50.743
I'm proving quite resourceful
on this journey

44:50.743 --> 44:52.044
and we haven't even left yet.

44:52.044 --> 44:54.813
No telling how
I'll save the day next.

44:54.813 --> 44:56.749
Yeah. No telling.

44:56.749 --> 44:58.083
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:58.083 --> 45:00.853
Is my jovial nature infringing
upon your sullenness?

45:04.790 --> 45:07.660
You're not going to do
this the entire trip, are you?

45:07.660 --> 45:09.762
- Do what?
- Talk.

45:09.762 --> 45:11.897
I talk when I'm nervous.

45:11.897 --> 45:14.166
If you'd speak as well you could
cut my talking by half,

45:14.166 --> 45:16.468
but no, you're too busy sulking,

45:16.468 --> 45:18.003
which makes me doubt everything,

45:18.003 --> 45:19.571
which makes me more nervous,

45:19.571 --> 45:22.274
which means I must double
my talking to compensate.

45:27.146 --> 45:28.781
Frankly, I'm shocked
it bothers you.

45:28.781 --> 45:30.949
Most men find it
quite endearing.

45:30.949 --> 45:34.853
I've blabbered my way into many
a courtship, let me assure you.

45:34.853 --> 45:36.288
I have no doubt.

45:39.625 --> 45:41.960
This is it.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.529
This is what?

45:43.529 --> 45:45.431
Our ship.

45:45.431 --> 45:46.432
What is it?

45:46.432 --> 45:47.966
Tugboat.

45:47.966 --> 45:51.003
Spencer, I don't think
those are supposed

45:51.003 --> 45:53.072
to leave the harbor.

45:53.072 --> 45:54.440
This one's leaving the harbor.

46:07.886 --> 46:09.488
I'm supposed to ask
permission?

46:12.858 --> 46:14.860
Girl with you?

46:14.860 --> 46:16.295
Girl's with me.

46:16.295 --> 46:19.598
Quarters are small, and the
seas can be rough on a tug.

46:19.598 --> 46:21.367
I'm tougher than I look.

46:21.367 --> 46:22.801
I used to say that.

46:22.801 --> 46:26.438
Now, I'm an old man and
I'm looking tougher than I am.

46:31.176 --> 46:35.581
All right. So, come aboard.

46:42.855 --> 46:44.323
You can stow your gear below.

46:46.725 --> 46:48.660
Free the lines
from the bollards.

46:51.597 --> 46:55.100
Untie the ropes from those
hooks, then roll it up

46:55.100 --> 46:56.468
and store it on deck.

47:18.424 --> 47:20.259
And we're off.

47:20.259 --> 47:24.696
No safety brief, no--

47:24.696 --> 47:26.064
typically, a toast to
the Gods of the sea...

47:29.201 --> 47:31.136
This is the
easiest it'll be.

47:31.136 --> 47:33.105
Okay?

47:33.105 --> 47:35.307
Just be careful, I don't need
you bouncing off into the bay.

47:47.953 --> 47:50.055
How far does
this boat take us?

47:50.055 --> 47:52.124
Suez Canal.

47:52.124 --> 47:54.359
From there we find
a ship going anywhere.

47:54.359 --> 47:57.129
Venice, Messina, Barcelona.

47:57.129 --> 48:00.065
- Then what?
- Whatever takes us west.

48:00.065 --> 48:02.134
Your vacation's over,
I'm afraid.

48:04.970 --> 48:06.839
But the adventure
is just beginning.

48:51.083 --> 48:52.284
Shit.

48:58.690 --> 48:59.758
It's hot.

48:59.758 --> 49:00.993
Thank you.

49:34.226 --> 49:36.094
I'll be right back.

49:51.577 --> 49:53.011
What the hell
is it doing?

49:53.011 --> 49:55.380
It's a ghost.

49:55.380 --> 49:57.683
A ghost ship.
Boilers blew in the spring,

49:57.683 --> 50:02.721
and crew abandoned ship,
but she didn't sink. No, no.

50:02.721 --> 50:04.222
And she won't run aground.

50:04.222 --> 50:06.158
The current
in this channel holds her.

50:06.158 --> 50:10.095
Now, she lists back
and forth hunting captains

50:10.095 --> 50:12.230
who don't pay attention.

50:52.437 --> 50:53.505
Are they mad?

50:56.441 --> 50:57.643
It's abandoned.

50:57.643 --> 51:00.412
No one's
piloting the ship.

51:04.783 --> 51:05.851
It's just floating?

51:07.185 --> 51:08.854
Just floating.

51:32.344 --> 51:35.847
There was this ghost ship
called the Zebrina.

51:35.847 --> 51:39.718
British cargo ship hauling coal.

51:43.722 --> 51:46.792
She ran aground in France

51:46.792 --> 51:49.728
after floating past
all of you fellas

51:49.728 --> 51:52.130
coming to join the war.

51:52.130 --> 51:55.000
My hospital ship ran
from her for weeks.

51:56.902 --> 52:01.540
I swear that empty bitch,
she was chasing us.

52:09.081 --> 52:11.316
But the strangest thing
I ever saw

52:11.316 --> 52:13.652
was off the coast
of Indonesia.

52:13.652 --> 52:16.755
Little dinghies,
two-man fishing skiffs,

52:16.755 --> 52:23.028
Just floating, three hundred
miles off shore.

52:25.430 --> 52:27.833
The seagulls swarmed
'em like hornets,

52:27.833 --> 52:32.003
picking at the men inside.

52:32.003 --> 52:34.072
And there must have been

52:34.072 --> 52:38.944
a thousand of them
small dinghies, maybe more.

52:38.944 --> 52:40.946
I passed 'em for a week.

52:43.281 --> 52:46.718
Must have been a big swell

52:46.718 --> 52:48.520
that pushed 'em all out
to sea.

52:50.021 --> 52:52.724
I don't know.

52:52.724 --> 52:54.326
It's a mystery.

53:01.199 --> 53:02.501
The sea's like that.

53:04.569 --> 53:07.539
Cunning...

53:07.539 --> 53:08.940
Like a fox.

53:12.277 --> 53:14.946
Always looking
for ways to trick you.

53:18.583 --> 53:21.887
Now, who wants first watch?

53:24.556 --> 53:25.991
What do you do on watch?

53:27.759 --> 53:29.494
Pilot the boat, ma'am.

53:31.296 --> 53:32.931
Who's piloting the boat now?

53:35.767 --> 53:37.335
The fox.

53:50.248 --> 53:51.983
Looks like
I've got first watch.

53:55.854 --> 53:57.522
I'm coming with you.

54:04.196 --> 54:06.097
There's not much to it.
This is the wheel.

54:06.097 --> 54:08.200
Tiller rope connect
it to the rudder.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.901
Turn the wheel,
you turn the rudder...

54:09.901 --> 54:11.636
Compass.

54:11.636 --> 54:15.874
Now, our course is fifteen
degrees north-northeast.

54:15.874 --> 54:17.642
The wheel is locked
on that heading.

54:17.642 --> 54:20.045
If you need to adjust,
you do it right here.

54:23.348 --> 54:24.549
How far off the coast are we?

54:24.549 --> 54:26.351
Twenty miles.

54:26.351 --> 54:29.454
Just far enough the pirates
can't see us from shore.

54:29.454 --> 54:31.556
Now, here's the throttle.

54:31.556 --> 54:34.993
You gotta go fast to turn fast,
go slow to turn slow.

54:34.993 --> 54:36.528
Right?

54:36.528 --> 54:39.164
But you shouldn't turn unless
there's something
in front of you,

54:39.164 --> 54:41.266
and there shouldn't be
anything in front of you.

54:41.266 --> 54:42.801
Radio work?

54:42.801 --> 54:44.603
It works when it works.

54:44.603 --> 54:45.837
What's the distress channel?

54:45.837 --> 54:47.839
Hundred fifty-eight point six.

54:47.839 --> 54:49.341
Dial is right there.

54:49.341 --> 54:51.610
But if there's any distress
don't use the radio,

54:51.610 --> 54:53.178
come and get me.

54:53.178 --> 54:55.447
Now that's three-hour
shifts each.

54:55.447 --> 54:57.482
So wake me up in six.

55:36.488 --> 55:37.989
Don't turn it.

55:37.989 --> 55:39.791
I'm not.

55:39.791 --> 55:42.627
I'm awaiting the calamity
I must react to.

55:42.627 --> 55:45.497
I'm driving the ship.

55:45.497 --> 55:47.999
Piloting,
I think they call it.

55:47.999 --> 55:50.035
I'm piloting the ship.

55:52.170 --> 55:53.271
I need a hat.

55:53.271 --> 55:55.907
One shouldn't pilot
without a hat. I feel naked.

55:59.811 --> 56:02.314
Don't get any ideas.

56:02.314 --> 56:04.149
This is no tree
in the Serengeti.

56:04.149 --> 56:06.584
This is serious
business, piloting.

56:12.223 --> 56:13.258
Thank you.

56:14.592 --> 56:15.593
For what?

56:19.664 --> 56:21.232
Just thank you.

56:21.232 --> 56:23.668
For talking you out
of abandoning me in Mombasa

56:23.668 --> 56:25.937
and piloting you across the sea,

56:25.937 --> 56:28.974
nothing but my nautical
expertise to guide the way?

56:28.974 --> 56:31.476
You're quite welcome

56:31.476 --> 56:33.411
You're gonna be hard to argue
with when the time comes.

56:34.879 --> 56:37.215
It will be most unpleasant
for you, I'm afraid.

56:38.583 --> 56:39.584
Me, too.

56:47.292 --> 56:48.994
Don't ever doubt
me again, Spencer.

56:50.862 --> 56:53.698
If you never doubt me
I'll never doubt you.

56:57.302 --> 56:58.970
It wasn't a doubt.

57:01.406 --> 57:03.608
It was a worry.

57:03.608 --> 57:05.076
Well, don't do it.

57:07.979 --> 57:09.214
I'll never doubt you.

57:13.084 --> 57:14.185
It's settled then.

57:16.154 --> 57:17.956
You can be my love slave.

57:30.268 --> 57:31.269
Ah!

57:34.606 --> 57:35.640
Yes.

58:35.127 --> 58:36.162
Hey.

58:37.296 --> 58:38.698
Let's go down below.

58:38.698 --> 58:40.199
Our watch is up.

59:33.152 --> 59:34.587
Three o'clock?

59:35.955 --> 59:37.423
Yeah.

59:42.628 --> 59:44.296
I'll take the next watch.

59:46.732 --> 59:48.501
It's my watch.

59:48.501 --> 59:50.736
Old man, you need to rest.

59:50.736 --> 59:52.772
This is my fucking ship.

59:52.772 --> 59:55.741
Only one who gives orders here:

59:55.741 --> 59:57.076
me.

1:01:03.709 --> 1:01:04.744
We should probably...

1:01:07.313 --> 1:01:08.380
Do you think we could...

1:01:10.616 --> 1:01:12.618
I would like to set a date
for the wedding.

1:01:12.618 --> 1:01:14.787
I'm sure you would, dear.

1:01:14.787 --> 1:01:16.956
But we should wait
until the spring.

1:01:16.956 --> 1:01:19.291
I'm afraid...

1:01:19.291 --> 1:01:21.127
I don't think my dress
will fit in the spring.

1:01:21.127 --> 1:01:23.062
There isn't enough rum cake
in Montana

1:01:23.062 --> 1:01:24.964
to put a pound
on you, girl.

1:01:24.964 --> 1:01:27.066
Not because of cake.

1:01:30.336 --> 1:01:31.670
We said our vows, we just...

1:01:31.670 --> 1:01:33.939
Left the law out of it.
And the preacher.

1:01:33.939 --> 1:01:35.841
And everyone else.

1:01:43.783 --> 1:01:46.252
That is the first
good news these ears

1:01:46.252 --> 1:01:47.820
have heard in months.

1:01:53.959 --> 1:01:55.861
Oh!

1:01:59.398 --> 1:02:03.669
Yes, we will plan
a small wedding very soon.

1:02:03.669 --> 1:02:06.405
With a preacher who knows how
to backdate the license,

1:02:06.405 --> 1:02:08.073
if you know what I mean.

1:02:09.175 --> 1:02:11.811
Well, they can do that?

1:02:11.811 --> 1:02:15.681
It's the savior of
countless reputations, my dear.

1:02:36.569 --> 1:02:37.603
Gah!

1:03:26.485 --> 1:03:28.721
Let me up.

1:03:29.788 --> 1:03:31.523
- What's wrong?
- Engines aren't running.

1:04:02.821 --> 1:04:05.491
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

1:04:08.093 --> 1:04:10.829
<i>This is S.S. Lambridge.
What's your mayday?</i>

1:04:10.829 --> 1:04:13.299
I'm a passenger
on a tug headed to Suez.

1:04:13.299 --> 1:04:16.235
The Captain has expired.

1:04:16.235 --> 1:04:17.436
<i>Can you read a compass?</i>

1:04:17.436 --> 1:04:18.737
I can.

1:04:18.737 --> 1:04:20.039
<i>What is your heading?</i>

1:04:20.039 --> 1:04:21.540
Due east but we're drifting.

1:04:21.540 --> 1:04:23.642
<i>Have you nautical maps?</i>

1:04:23.642 --> 1:04:26.145
- We do.
- <i>Alright, chap.</i>

1:04:26.145 --> 1:04:27.646
<i>I'll talk you through
finding your bearings</i>

1:04:27.646 --> 1:04:29.515
<i>with the compass...</i>

1:04:29.515 --> 1:04:31.183
<i>Sir?</i>

1:06:01.106 --> 1:06:02.608
You'd be Mrs. Dutton.

1:06:02.608 --> 1:06:03.942
I would.

1:06:03.942 --> 1:06:06.412
Don Whitfield.
Seems we are neighbors.

1:06:06.412 --> 1:06:08.414
I've acquired
the Strafford Ranch.

1:06:08.414 --> 1:06:10.249
The Lazy S.
is the name.

1:06:10.249 --> 1:06:12.785
That's the brand.
And I've no use for it.

1:06:12.785 --> 1:06:15.120
Perhaps it's useful to you?

1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:16.722
We have a brand.

1:06:16.722 --> 1:06:18.824
If you'd like
another, it's yours.

1:06:18.824 --> 1:06:20.592
One is plenty.
Thank you.

1:06:22.995 --> 1:06:25.731
I'd love to meet your husband.

1:06:25.731 --> 1:06:28.100
Is there a time
I might pay a visit?

1:06:28.100 --> 1:06:30.602
I'll inform him
of your interest.

1:06:30.602 --> 1:06:32.871
We could choose a time now.

1:06:32.871 --> 1:06:34.673
I don't keep his calendar.

1:06:34.673 --> 1:06:38.744
Isn't that what
rancher's wives do?

1:06:38.744 --> 1:06:41.013
Keep the books and the calendar?

1:06:41.013 --> 1:06:42.314
Not this wife.

1:06:43.882 --> 1:06:47.352
Then perhaps I'll just
stop by and see if he's free.

1:06:48.887 --> 1:06:52.191
The valley is changing.
Progress is upon us.

1:06:52.191 --> 1:06:54.760
There are opportunities
beyond cattle,

1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:57.796
which isn't much of
a business these days.

1:06:57.796 --> 1:07:01.900
More of a...
dream, really.

1:07:03.602 --> 1:07:04.970
And not a good one.

1:07:06.004 --> 1:07:08.207
Well, it's our dream.

1:07:29.428 --> 1:07:31.096
Think she'll sell?

1:07:31.096 --> 1:07:33.732
What choice does she have?

1:07:33.732 --> 1:07:37.035
Let her spend a winter here
without her husband

1:07:37.035 --> 1:07:39.638
to run that ranch.

1:07:39.638 --> 1:07:44.076
By spring she'll beg me
to buy it.

1:07:54.286 --> 1:07:56.355
Oh...

1:07:56.355 --> 1:07:58.757
Winter can't wait
to have its way with us.

1:07:58.757 --> 1:08:00.592
I expected you earlier.

1:08:00.592 --> 1:08:03.962
It's been an
interesting morning.

1:08:03.962 --> 1:08:06.231
It's about to
get more interesting.

1:08:07.633 --> 1:08:08.901
Cable came this morning.

1:08:29.821 --> 1:08:32.291
<i>Aunt Cara...</i>

1:08:32.291 --> 1:08:33.992
<i>I received your letter...</i>

1:08:37.462 --> 1:08:38.697
<i>and I am coming home.</i>
