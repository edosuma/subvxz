00:00.690 --> 00:01.650
Previously on The OC:

00:01.650 --> 00:04.689
There are rumors floating around about certain improprieties

00:04.689 --> 00:07.570
concerning Griffin and you and they're going to call for a criminal investigation.

00:07.570 --> 00:09.050
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.730
I am not going to use my alcoholism as blackmail to save our marriage.

00:12.730 --> 00:13.970
- Are you smoking pot?
- You want some?

00:13.970 --> 00:16.329
It helps take the edge off and I could tell you could use it.

00:16.329 --> 00:19.370
Seth's napkin confession detailing all of his lies and deceptions.

00:19.370 --> 00:21.690
He told me if he screwed up I could show this to his parents.

00:21.690 --> 00:24.170
I promised I'd never lie again when I gave you that letter.

00:24.170 --> 00:25.050
Oh, my God, the letter.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.090
Did you think you can just dress up your bad boy

00:27.090 --> 00:29.010
so your friends can see how cool you are?

00:29.010 --> 00:31.610
The Ryan I knew would've gotten in a fight with that guy back at the prom.

00:31.610 --> 00:32.490
The money is gone.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.330
I hid the money in my purse. I had $5,000 in my purse.

01:48.010 --> 01:49.650
Can we get some help over here?!

01:54.330 --> 01:55.730
He get hit with a baseball bat or something?

01:55.730 --> 01:56.290
No, no.

01:56.290 --> 01:57.290
How long's he been unconscious?

01:57.290 --> 01:58.810
I got him here as soon as I could.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.010
Do you know them?

02:00.730 --> 02:02.810
The guys who did this, do you know who they are?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.730
Got jumped.

02:05.090 --> 02:06.570
Didn't see them.

02:07.570 --> 02:09.210
Look, I'm okay.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.450
Come on, buddy. Glad you're alive, but we still got to check you out.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.330
Police will have some questions for you, too.

02:14.330 --> 02:15.730
Yeah, okay.

02:18.850 --> 02:21.210
Meet me at my place tomorrow.

02:21.290 --> 02:23.050
This ain't over.

02:33.690 --> 02:34.850
Where's your friend?

02:35.290 --> 02:36.810
He's not my friend.

03:29.366 --> 03:31.286
Kait... Kaitlin?

03:31.286 --> 03:33.406
- Hey, sis.
- Hey.

03:33.686 --> 03:35.206
You just calling to say hi?

03:35.206 --> 03:36.246
Totally.

03:36.246 --> 03:38.326
So how's your life? How's Ryan?

03:38.326 --> 03:40.806
What'd you do last night? Give me all the deets.

03:41.166 --> 03:45.166
Well, Ryan and I broke up and my prom date got with another girl.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.926
Ah, really? That's great.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.926
Listen, I'm actually calling you to ask you a favor.

03:48.926 --> 03:50.846
What, your friend Megan needs another abortion?

03:50.846 --> 03:51.606
I wish.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.486
But, um, actually, my school sent Mom a letter

03:54.486 --> 03:56.326
and I kind of need you to get it for me.

03:56.326 --> 03:58.966
And by "get," do you mean keep it from her?

03:58.966 --> 04:01.486
Look, I'm totally all over this situation.

04:01.486 --> 04:03.886
I just need a little bit more time.

04:03.886 --> 04:04.926
Oh, Kaitlin...

04:04.926 --> 04:06.806
Look, Marissa, I'm begging you.

04:06.806 --> 04:10.326
If you have one sisterly bone in your body, you will do this for me.

04:10.966 --> 04:12.286
Please?

04:12.326 --> 04:15.406
Fine, I'll see if it's there, but you have to promise to tell me why.

04:15.406 --> 04:16.886
Oh, thank you. I love you.

04:16.886 --> 04:20.245
Okay, I love you... too.

04:31.286 --> 04:32.126
Hi.

04:32.126 --> 04:33.606
Hi, what are you doing?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.446
Nothing much. How 'bout you?

04:35.686 --> 04:37.766
Just got off the phone with the guy.

04:37.766 --> 04:42.006
Oh. The, uh... work guy. How'd that go?

04:42.006 --> 04:45.806
Oh, not well. It's kind of hard for a 28-year-old to understand prom.

04:45.846 --> 04:47.086
I get that.

04:47.526 --> 04:50.246
You don't regret going, do you?

04:50.246 --> 04:52.046
No, not at all. I had fun.

04:52.046 --> 04:56.846
And after you left, things got pretty interesting in the limo with Taylor and the dates...

04:56.846 --> 04:59.486
and I don't know what the Korean word for "threesome" is,

04:59.486 --> 05:01.726
but I'm pretty sure it was used.

05:03.766 --> 05:05.686
- Ryan?
- Yep.

05:06.886 --> 05:10.046
That thing that you had to take care of last night...

05:10.046 --> 05:11.566
It's taken care of.

05:12.566 --> 05:13.766
Okay.

05:14.846 --> 05:16.086
Do you want to hang out today?

05:16.086 --> 05:18.846
I have to do something this afternoon. I'm not sure how long it's gonna take.

05:18.846 --> 05:22.486
Well, how about later for dinner? I could bring over takeout.

05:22.486 --> 05:24.086
Yeah, that sounds good.

05:24.526 --> 05:25.406
Okay.

05:25.406 --> 05:26.726
Yeah, okay.

05:26.806 --> 05:29.406
Hey, man. Today's a good day for me, Ryan.

05:29.406 --> 05:34.046
I finally came clean, told the truth about not getting into Brown and things are great.

05:34.046 --> 05:35.886
Life is so much better when you're honest.

05:35.886 --> 05:39.166
You just mean what you say, you say what you mean. I feel like you.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.326
Well, now that you're on a roll, you gonna tell Sandy and Kirsten about Brown, too?

05:42.326 --> 05:45.006
Yeah, I don't think so. I'm going to wait a little bit on that one.

05:45.006 --> 05:48.326
I think it'll go down a bit easier with an acceptance letter to RISD in my hand.

05:48.326 --> 05:50.166
- And what if they find out first?
- They won't.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.926
Things are finally going good between Summer and I.

05:51.926 --> 05:55.126
Can't this family have one weekend without a major crisis?

05:57.286 --> 05:58.726
Hey, Summ.

06:00.566 --> 06:01.886
How are you?

06:02.766 --> 06:07.326
I wish I could pluck out my eyeballs with a fork and rinse them in a tall glass of ice water.

06:07.326 --> 06:09.206
Yeah, that's a hangover.

06:09.566 --> 06:12.246
You were pretty wasted last night.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.086
I was, wasn't I?

06:14.086 --> 06:16.566
I don't even remember getting home.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.366
I woke up this morning and my ears were ringing

06:20.366 --> 06:22.446
and I realized it was your phone.

06:22.446 --> 06:25.046
Yeah, Kaitlin was calling 'cause there's this letter

06:25.046 --> 06:27.006
from her school that she wants me to grab.

06:27.006 --> 06:28.246
Oh, my God.

06:28.246 --> 06:29.446
Oh, my God, the letter.

06:29.446 --> 06:31.206
What? How do you know what it is?

06:31.206 --> 06:34.766
No, no, Cohen's confession. I left it in an envelope on Sandy's desk.

06:34.766 --> 06:36.806
Oh, so call Seth. Tell him to grab it.

06:36.806 --> 06:39.166
I can't. Things are finally normal again between us.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.166
Oh, my gosh, once he realizes what I did.

06:41.166 --> 06:42.446
I gotta go.

06:43.686 --> 06:45.646
Oh, my God, nausea tsunami.

06:50.806 --> 06:52.806
Well, it's a little unexpected.

06:52.886 --> 06:56.646
I mean, this hospital project has been, uh...

06:57.086 --> 06:58.846
it's been complicated.

07:00.766 --> 07:04.166
Oh, well... I'm glad to hear it.

07:04.406 --> 07:06.406
I look forward to tomorrow night.

07:06.446 --> 07:07.886
Thank you.

07:18.246 --> 07:19.966
You're not going to believe this.

07:20.046 --> 07:23.366
I am Riviera magazine's Man of the Year.

07:24.326 --> 07:26.086
Try not to faint.

07:26.126 --> 07:29.046
I'm sorry, it's just given everything that's happened...

07:29.046 --> 07:32.406
They're calling the hospital phase one of Orange County's renaissance,

07:32.406 --> 07:36.406
thinking it could be a model for responsible development for the entire country.

07:36.406 --> 07:38.046
Responsible development?

07:38.046 --> 07:41.606
Sandy, the only thing it's responsible for is a lot of sleepless nights

07:41.606 --> 07:43.806
and Matt Ramsey's black eye.

07:43.806 --> 07:45.646
You know my father was Man of the Year.

07:45.646 --> 07:48.166
The irony is not lost on me, believe me.

07:48.166 --> 07:51.046
But, hey, this could mean that maybe the dark days are over,

07:51.046 --> 07:53.286
that something good is coming from all this.

07:53.286 --> 07:54.886
I'd like to think so.

07:54.886 --> 07:56.246
But I honestly doubt it.

07:56.246 --> 07:58.126
Well, I wasn't expecting your blessing.

07:58.126 --> 08:01.646
But until we have proof to the contrary, let's try to be optimistic.

08:04.046 --> 08:05.006
Hey.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.846
Why don't you say good morning to Newport's Man of the Year?

08:07.846 --> 08:09.566
I knew it was only a matter of time before this town

08:09.566 --> 08:11.846
recognized my contribution to the community.

08:11.846 --> 08:13.846
Have to be a man first. Congratulations, Sandy.

08:13.846 --> 08:15.326
Thank you. Big party tomorrow night.

08:15.326 --> 08:18.206
Everybody's got to dress up and represent.

08:18.366 --> 08:21.166
And just think, I couldn't get you to wear a tie at cotillion.

08:21.166 --> 08:24.446
College letters, senior prom... this family's on a streak.

08:24.446 --> 08:26.166
Let's try to enjoy it.

08:26.566 --> 08:28.286
- I gotta go.
- Me, too.

08:33.486 --> 08:34.726
You excited?

08:36.206 --> 08:38.885
It'll be good for your father's career.

08:41.246 --> 08:43.606
Oh, my God, Mr. C, you totally scared me.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.366
Sometimes I scare myself, Summer.

08:45.366 --> 08:46.686
Seth's in the kitchen.

08:46.686 --> 08:48.566
- I'll just go right in.
- All right.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.046
What are you doing?

09:03.046 --> 09:05.126
Nothing. Looking for stamps.

09:05.206 --> 09:06.526
Are you mailing a letter?

09:06.526 --> 09:08.926
Not without stamps. Let's go make out upstairs.

09:13.566 --> 09:17.326
Hey, is everything okay? You sounded weird on the phone.

09:17.326 --> 09:18.886
You can give that to Taylor.

09:20.406 --> 09:21.926
What, her after-party money?

09:21.926 --> 09:23.846
Yeah, it was stolen at the prom.

09:24.526 --> 09:25.806
Kevin...

09:27.526 --> 09:29.926
I can't believe he stole that.

09:29.966 --> 09:31.446
I should go over there and kick his...

09:31.446 --> 09:34.006
No, no, no, no. We got the money, so forget it.

09:35.686 --> 09:38.046
Uh, just, uh, I don't really want to talk about it.

09:38.046 --> 09:41.526
But if you could just give that to Taylor, no questions ask, that'd be good.

09:41.526 --> 09:42.766
Yeah.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.566
You can count on me.

09:46.406 --> 09:48.326
I need to focus on other stuff anyway.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.806
I was gonna take a road trip this weekend.

09:50.806 --> 09:53.326
So, maybe I should just go home and pack.

09:54.046 --> 09:55.686
Can I buy you breakfast?

09:57.846 --> 09:59.006
Sure.

10:06.566 --> 10:08.526
Where is your dad going this morning?

10:09.606 --> 10:11.526
You thinking about my dad?

10:11.526 --> 10:14.206
He had his briefcase with him. Does he usually keep important papers in there?

10:14.206 --> 10:16.326
Whoa, you turned me on.

10:16.806 --> 10:18.366
I'm sorry.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.006
Cohen, there's something I need to tell you.

10:21.006 --> 10:22.446
You're using me to get to my father?

10:22.446 --> 10:23.446
Serious.

10:23.446 --> 10:25.086
So is this. We just got back together.

10:25.086 --> 10:28.686
The window for a makeup hookup is rapidly closing unless you want to break up again.

10:28.686 --> 10:30.206
No, definitely not.

10:30.206 --> 10:32.126
Okay, so what do you have to tell me?

10:35.246 --> 10:36.926
I want to be on top this time.

10:37.126 --> 10:38.566
You are always on top.

10:38.566 --> 10:40.406
Of course, we'll be there.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.366
Hey, it's something to celebrate.

10:42.366 --> 10:44.406
Okay, bye, Kiks.

10:44.806 --> 10:45.926
Huh.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.406
Hey, good news?

10:47.406 --> 10:51.006
Yes. Sandy Cohen has just been named Newport's Man of the Year.

10:51.006 --> 10:53.286
There's a party for him tomorrow night at the yacht club.

10:53.526 --> 10:55.846
Well, that ought to be interesting.

10:55.846 --> 10:56.446
What do you mean?

10:56.446 --> 10:58.446
Sandy's being investigated by the DA.

10:58.446 --> 11:00.646
They're filing charges against Henry Griffin.

11:00.686 --> 11:02.846
And Sandy's been working very closely with him.

11:02.846 --> 11:04.806
Oh, wow.

11:05.086 --> 11:08.126
I mean, Sandy is obviously very involved with the hospital,

11:08.126 --> 11:11.566
but I can't imagine him doing anything unethical.

11:11.566 --> 11:15.086
He can be self-righteous, pompous and annoying, but...

11:15.086 --> 11:16.646
Sandy is very moral.

11:16.646 --> 11:20.286
Well, we'll find out. I'm sitting down with the district attorney tomorrow.

11:20.286 --> 11:22.206
So we have to warn Sandy.

11:22.326 --> 11:23.926
I already did.

11:24.646 --> 11:26.726
Then why doesn't Kirsten know?

11:31.646 --> 11:32.966
How you doing?

11:34.166 --> 11:38.966
Seven stitches, couple of broken ribs... I'll live.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.126
I'm glad.

11:40.126 --> 11:41.806
I didn't mean to, uh...

11:43.406 --> 11:45.366
Well, not that bad anyway.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.446
It's not like I didn't ask for it.

11:49.966 --> 11:52.926
So the money is returned, you got your stitches and...

11:53.126 --> 11:55.326
- we're good, right?
- Not quite.

11:55.326 --> 11:57.286
I need some help.

11:57.286 --> 11:59.486
I'm supposed to have picked something up from this guy.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.726
- No, no, no, no...
- Just be my lookout,

12:01.726 --> 12:05.206
- drive and wait in the car.
- Whatever you're into, drugs, guns...

12:05.206 --> 12:06.206
It's none of your business.

12:06.206 --> 12:07.566
I know, and I don't want it to be.

12:07.566 --> 12:09.886
Right, 'cause you got the good life now.

12:09.886 --> 12:12.726
Graduation... college...

12:13.326 --> 12:16.286
You know all that change when you're charged with assault.

12:17.806 --> 12:20.806
You tell the cops about me, and I'll tell them about the money.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.766
Money? What money?

12:22.766 --> 12:25.286
- I-I don't see any money.
- Nobody's gonna believe you?

12:25.846 --> 12:30.046
I don't care if they do, 'cause I've got nothing to lose.

12:30.046 --> 12:31.926
And you've got everything.

12:32.046 --> 12:33.846
That's why you're a little bitch.

12:33.846 --> 12:36.206
And that's why you'll help me out tomorrow night.

12:37.086 --> 12:38.566
No, no, I can't tomorrow night.

12:38.566 --> 12:40.966
Sandy's Man of the Year's big party.

12:42.406 --> 12:44.806
And I guess they'll be cuffing you in your suit.

13:06.255 --> 13:09.815
Daddy, you can't do this to yourself every time you get the ratings.

13:09.815 --> 13:12.935
It's my dad. You know The Valley? That's a show.

13:13.015 --> 13:17.295
What do you expect when you beat the same love triangle to the ground for three years?

13:17.935 --> 13:18.735
Who are you?

13:18.735 --> 13:21.815
Oh, uh... Marissa. Kaitlin's sister.

13:21.815 --> 13:23.895
Hey, bitch, your sister is here.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.255
Nice to meet you. I'm Hadley.

13:26.655 --> 13:29.615
Dad, I thought I told you to stay off the message boards.

13:29.615 --> 13:30.815
Marissa, what are you doing here?

13:30.815 --> 13:33.095
Waiting for you to explain this.

13:36.215 --> 13:40.855
Thanks for coming by, Kiks. I didn't want to talk to you about this on the phone.

13:40.855 --> 13:43.455
No, of course, no problem. What's going on?

13:43.455 --> 13:44.935
Um, sit down.

13:46.975 --> 13:49.495
Uh, it's Sandy.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.655
He's being investigated by the DA.

13:52.895 --> 13:54.895
- Let me guess: the hospital.
- Yeah.

13:54.895 --> 13:57.775
Neil is meeting with the DA tomorrow. It seems serious.

13:57.775 --> 14:00.295
I'm so sorry, Kirsten. I just thought you should know.

14:00.295 --> 14:01.375
No, of course.

14:01.375 --> 14:04.335
Especially with Sandy being Man of the Year. It'll be in all the papers.

14:04.335 --> 14:07.815
And speaking of someone who's had to manage more than her share of scandal,

14:07.815 --> 14:10.415
you need to contain this ASAP.

14:10.415 --> 14:12.695
Julie, I appreciate the heads-up.

14:12.975 --> 14:15.775
Sandy's going to take this really hard.

14:16.455 --> 14:18.255
Sandy knows.

14:18.655 --> 14:20.855
Neil told him at dinner last night.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.535
So your mom has the baby?

14:26.535 --> 14:28.495
Mm. The nanny.

14:29.735 --> 14:33.095
What, when we were growing up stealing all those empties to buy Sour Patch Kids,

14:33.095 --> 14:35.175
you didn't imagine me as the kind of girl hat would have a nanny?

14:35.175 --> 14:37.335
Uh, you've come a long way, is all.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.535
So have you.

14:38.535 --> 14:42.455
You're graduating on Monday and Berkeley in the fall.

14:49.015 --> 14:52.015
So last night after you left me with Taylor...

14:52.015 --> 14:53.255
Just don't, okay?

14:53.255 --> 14:55.335
Look, Ryan, there's only one thing that could have done that to your hand,

14:55.335 --> 14:56.775
and that's another guy's face.

14:56.775 --> 15:00.535
That kid stole the money, and you went to fight him.

15:07.175 --> 15:09.055
Go ahead. Answer it.

15:14.535 --> 15:15.775
Hi.

15:15.935 --> 15:18.735
No, no, no, I cannot right now, okay?

15:18.935 --> 15:21.455
Well, give me a couple of hours at least.

15:21.455 --> 15:22.855
You should have told them you'd be right there.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.575
Teresa, Teresa! Look, there's things that I...

15:25.655 --> 15:29.535
that I can't tell the Cohens or Seth because they wouldn't understand it, but you...

15:30.215 --> 15:32.335
My life has totally changed since we were kids.

15:32.335 --> 15:32.855
So has mine.

15:32.855 --> 15:36.535
No, Ryan, there are guys out there that don't get in fights, not ever, not any.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.095
Like the guy at work?

15:38.415 --> 15:40.855
Look, I have a child to think about now, okay?

15:40.855 --> 15:43.615
And I cannot be with someone like my brother or yours.

15:43.615 --> 15:44.535
Well, I'm not like him.

15:44.535 --> 15:46.335
Maybe on your good days, you're not,

15:46.335 --> 15:49.455
but right now, my life isn't built for the bad ones.

15:53.135 --> 15:55.775
I will always love you, Ryan.

16:00.095 --> 16:01.655
Keep safe.

16:06.775 --> 16:09.655
You walked into the kitchen the morning and asked me to be optimistic.

16:09.655 --> 16:11.895
Well, they can't have much of a case, not against Griffin

16:11.895 --> 16:13.255
and certainly not against me.

16:13.255 --> 16:15.135
I'm hoping the whole thing will go away,

16:15.135 --> 16:16.935
and maybe the Man of the Year thing will help that.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.175
Well, it's not.

16:18.175 --> 16:21.215
Neil Roberts is meeting with the district attorney tomorrow.

16:21.335 --> 16:24.535
Well, I'll talk to Greg Otis; he'll tell me what's going on.

16:25.295 --> 16:30.815
Honey, I promise you I'll do everything in my power not to let this land on the family.

16:31.815 --> 16:33.495
It already has.

17:12.775 --> 17:16.375
His name is Trevor Knightly, and he's the captain of the lacrosse team.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.535
Yeah, those girls are like his groupies.

17:18.535 --> 17:20.335
Lacrosse-stitutes.

17:21.535 --> 17:24.055
He's a total perv, and really into Adderall.

17:24.055 --> 17:25.855
So what's he got against you?

17:25.855 --> 17:27.095
Or should I even ask?

17:27.095 --> 17:30.775
He gave me a personal invitation to a lipstick party, and I declined.

17:30.775 --> 17:34.455
Obvie. Lipstick parties are for pervs and skanks.

17:34.455 --> 17:35.455
So heinous.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.135
Lipstick parties and Adderall.

17:37.135 --> 17:38.655
I'm sensing a generation gap.

17:38.655 --> 17:40.775
So the next morning, he was all telling the headmistress

17:40.775 --> 17:43.335
that he saw me taking the crest above her office.

17:43.335 --> 17:45.655
Well, it sounds like it's his word against yours.

17:45.655 --> 17:49.135
Oh, obvie, but he totally hides his evilness.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.815
Straight A's, varsity athlete.

17:52.095 --> 17:54.055
And Kaitlin's, well...

17:54.095 --> 17:55.775
Not exactly the perfect student.

17:55.775 --> 17:56.735
You don't say.

17:56.735 --> 17:58.775
Look, Marissa, this will be my third strike,

17:58.775 --> 18:00.935
and I really don't feel like getting kicked out.

18:00.935 --> 18:03.575
I mean, I know it may not be as bad as shooting somebody,

18:03.575 --> 18:05.655
but I'm pretty sure Mom would freak out.

18:05.655 --> 18:08.575
And by the way, I really don't feel like getting locked up during summer.

18:08.615 --> 18:11.655
Obvie. I get so horny in the summertime.

18:11.655 --> 18:12.975
Oh, honey, you're always horny.

18:12.975 --> 18:14.495
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

18:14.495 --> 18:16.415
Okay, both of you shut up.

18:16.415 --> 18:18.455
So what's the deal with this crest thing?

18:18.455 --> 18:19.775
I'm pretty sure it's in his room,

18:19.775 --> 18:22.495
but there's no way that he or any of his army of probably-gay

18:22.495 --> 18:25.535
and totally-in-love-with-him homeboys would let me in there.

18:29.815 --> 18:32.095
Well, I'm not usually one to come up with a plan,

18:32.095 --> 18:34.895
but do you have one of those skirts?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.095
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:45.215 --> 18:47.575
Here's Ryan. He's helping me.

18:48.975 --> 18:51.455
I'll leave the garage door unlocked when I finish work.

18:51.455 --> 18:52.975
It'll be inside.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.575
Thank you.

18:56.815 --> 18:58.535
- Good luck, man.
- All right, man.

19:03.015 --> 19:05.735
This is the address. You'll need it for the pickup.

19:11.575 --> 19:12.855
This is my neighborhood.

19:12.855 --> 19:14.295
That's why you're driving.

19:18.135 --> 19:20.695
Mom, I'm going to go get something to eat with Summer.

19:22.215 --> 19:23.535
Are you decent?

19:23.535 --> 19:26.055
If I come in, am I inviting years of therapy?

19:27.335 --> 19:28.575
Sorry.

19:39.135 --> 19:40.335
Mom?

19:49.735 --> 19:52.655
There you are, you... Ooh. Sorry.

19:55.535 --> 19:57.815
Cohen, is your mom sick or something?

19:58.055 --> 20:01.175
Yeah, she is. I'm going to have to stay and take care of her.

20:03.055 --> 20:06.375
Okay, well, then why don't I just go pick us up food, and I'll bring it back.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.455
Do you think your mom needs anything?

20:07.455 --> 20:10.015
Just peace and quiet. We're gonna have to rain-check dinner.

20:10.735 --> 20:12.855
Cohen, you're acting really weird.

20:12.855 --> 20:15.375
I feel weird, you know? Maybe whatever my mom has is contagious,

20:15.375 --> 20:17.855
and I'd hate for you to catch it and feel weird, too.

20:18.535 --> 20:19.495
You know?

20:19.495 --> 20:20.655
Well, okay.

21:35.242 --> 21:36.922
Hi. Are you Trevor?

21:36.922 --> 21:37.522
Yeah.

21:37.522 --> 21:40.042
I'm Marissa, the new foreign exchange student.

21:40.042 --> 21:41.522
I just got here from London.

21:41.522 --> 21:43.722
I love... London.

21:43.722 --> 21:45.962
Well, I was hoping you could give me a tour.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.362
Starting with your dorm room?

21:48.362 --> 21:51.482
Ooh, sounds good. But I did my junior year abroad at Oxford.

21:51.482 --> 21:54.162
I don't buy that phony English accent for a second.

21:54.682 --> 21:57.282
Okay, fine, I'm a stripper. Your friends hired me for your birthday.

21:57.282 --> 21:58.642
My birthday's not for six months.

21:58.842 --> 22:01.242
Do you want to see me take my clothes off or not?

22:10.602 --> 22:12.722
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

22:12.722 --> 22:13.922
Sure.

22:14.402 --> 22:16.082
Oh, you mean right now.

22:16.082 --> 22:18.322
Yeah. Well, you know, just kinda...

22:18.322 --> 22:20.042
Well, can it wait till after?

22:20.042 --> 22:23.362
Because I'm on my way to a meeting with my group.

22:23.362 --> 22:24.802
Yeah, how is that going?

22:24.802 --> 22:26.882
Well, you know what they say.

22:26.882 --> 22:28.162
One day at a time.

22:28.162 --> 22:29.602
That's why I have meetings.

22:40.002 --> 22:44.162
Greg Otis, my favorite DA. Now, this is a cozy spot.

22:44.162 --> 22:46.842
The lighting's a lot more flattering than an interrogation room.

22:46.842 --> 22:48.722
No one's being interrogated.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.962
Dr. Roberts and I are just going to talk.

22:52.122 --> 22:54.082
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

22:54.082 --> 22:55.842
The courtroom misses Sandy Cohen.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.682
Oh, not as much as he misses the courtroom, believe me.

22:59.602 --> 23:01.722
We've known each other a long time, Otis.

23:01.722 --> 23:03.442
What am I dealing with here?

23:03.762 --> 23:05.882
The case against Griffin's not strong.

23:05.882 --> 23:09.002
Everyone's got stories, but there's not a lot of hard evidence.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.162
Well, where do I fit in the picture?

23:11.162 --> 23:13.162
You're in bed with him on that hospital.

23:13.162 --> 23:16.562
Until I have proof otherwise, his improprieties are yours, too.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.802
Well, what if you had receipts, e-mails?

23:19.802 --> 23:21.202
An eyewitness?

23:21.202 --> 23:22.882
That would help a lot.

23:23.242 --> 23:27.202
In exchange for my cooperation, could you let The Newport Group finish the hospital?

23:27.402 --> 23:29.402
Griffin goes down, so does the hospital.

23:29.402 --> 23:31.002
No way around that.

23:32.562 --> 23:35.442
So I could keep my mouth shut and hope you lose.

23:35.442 --> 23:38.922
Or you can help bury that crook, say good-bye to the hospital.

23:40.322 --> 23:41.642
Dr. Roberts.

23:42.842 --> 23:44.522
Thanks for your time, Otis.

23:45.802 --> 23:47.922
I'm gonna leave you two to your discussion.

23:47.922 --> 23:49.762
- Good to see you, Neil.
- Sandy.

23:59.362 --> 24:00.722
That's the house.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.642
Now I just gotta wait for him to leave.

24:05.002 --> 24:06.562
You said we were picking something up.

24:06.562 --> 24:09.762
Yeah, well. He doesn't exactly know it.

24:09.842 --> 24:11.762
Ryan, is that you?

24:11.802 --> 24:12.962
Hey.

24:12.962 --> 24:14.682
Well, I was just coming back from my tennis lesson

24:14.682 --> 24:16.522
and I thought, isn't that the Cohens' car?

24:16.522 --> 24:17.482
It is.

24:17.482 --> 24:20.122
Well, save me a dance at Sandy's party tonight.

24:20.122 --> 24:21.082
Will do.

24:21.122 --> 24:23.362
And, uh... bring your friend.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.882
He's hot.

24:29.722 --> 24:30.842
A neighbor?

24:32.242 --> 24:34.682
Ah, told you this was a good plan.

24:40.362 --> 24:41.962
This isn't my dorm room.

24:42.402 --> 24:45.522
Yeah, well, you don't want people to walk in on us, do you?

24:46.002 --> 24:47.962
So, take off your pants.

24:47.962 --> 24:49.282
I thought you were going to strip for me.

24:49.282 --> 24:51.002
Haven't you ever been to Vegas?

24:51.002 --> 24:53.802
In your boxers, or I'll have to give those guys their money back.

24:53.802 --> 24:55.522
That would be a waste.

25:05.802 --> 25:07.362
Do they do this in Vegas, too?

25:07.362 --> 25:09.482
They do everything in Vegas.

25:10.002 --> 25:12.882
Okay. Now, I just have to go change.

25:13.002 --> 25:14.482
But you're wearing a costume.

25:14.482 --> 25:16.402
Hey! Come back here!

25:17.682 --> 25:18.922
- Did you get 'em?
- Yeah.

25:18.922 --> 25:20.602
- All right.
- We gotta go.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.562
- Hey.
- Hi, Mr. Cohen.

25:26.562 --> 25:29.482
- Is Seth around?
- No. I don't think so.

25:30.442 --> 25:32.802
Is it okay if I just, um, wait here for him?

25:32.802 --> 25:34.842
Sure. Make yourself at home.

25:39.322 --> 25:41.602
Do you mind if I-I wait here with you?

25:45.922 --> 25:48.602
I'm... I'm working, but, uh...

25:48.842 --> 25:50.282
suit yourself.

25:51.122 --> 25:54.682
So, uh, how's Mrs. Cohen? She feeling any better?

25:55.602 --> 25:57.362
I didn't know she was sick.

25:57.402 --> 26:01.522
Huh. Must have been like a 24-hour thing.

26:17.882 --> 26:19.522
So what's this?

26:19.962 --> 26:23.842
That is a card for Seth congratulating him

26:23.842 --> 26:26.482
on having a dad who was Man of the Year.

26:26.482 --> 26:28.882
Even though it's addressed to Kirsten and me?

26:30.082 --> 26:32.522
Okay, that is actually like a really big mistake,

26:32.522 --> 26:34.602
and I would do anything to take it back.

26:45.722 --> 26:51.882
"The most recent and troubling lies include..."

26:53.122 --> 26:54.562
Oh, Summer.

26:54.562 --> 26:57.162
Seth gave it to me on Valentine's Day when we got in a fight,

26:57.162 --> 27:00.482
and he said that if he ever screwed up again, that I should give it to you.

27:00.482 --> 27:02.562
Only he didn't screw up again. I did.

27:02.562 --> 27:03.802
This is serious.

27:03.802 --> 27:06.482
I did it out of spite. He told me that he wasn't going to Brown

27:06.482 --> 27:08.802
and then I saw him there with Anna.

27:08.802 --> 27:11.362
He said he wasn't going to Brown?

27:11.682 --> 27:14.322
Well, yeah, because he didn't get in but that was before RISD.

27:14.322 --> 27:16.602
What do you mean, he didn't get in?

27:17.922 --> 27:20.482
I thought he only lied about that to me.

27:22.602 --> 27:25.242
The only thing worse than relapsing...

27:25.642 --> 27:28.042
is that my husband doesn't know.

27:28.762 --> 27:31.562
He's involved in this business deal and...

27:32.162 --> 27:35.242
it's gotten very ugly and, uh...

27:37.642 --> 27:40.122
Well, he might even be arrested.

27:40.682 --> 27:45.642
And I'm not blaming anyone. I'm the only one with the power to drink or not drink.

27:47.282 --> 27:51.762
I just... really need the man I married right now.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.242
I want to talk to you.

28:04.122 --> 28:06.122
Good, I want to talk to you.

28:06.442 --> 28:07.962
I love you...

28:08.922 --> 28:10.842
and I'm worried about you.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.202
Right back at you.

28:14.202 --> 28:15.802
You smoked pot in our home.

28:15.802 --> 28:18.602
Would you rather I do it somewhere else, like my college dorm?

28:18.602 --> 28:21.202
That would require you getting into college.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.402
Well, do you think it's such a great idea,

28:24.402 --> 28:27.322
me going away to college when Mom's been drinking again?

28:28.082 --> 28:29.882
What are you talking about?

28:30.162 --> 28:33.042
Maybe if you paid attention to anything other than that stupid hospital,

28:33.042 --> 28:36.042
you'd notice Mom's been passing out before dinner.

28:36.122 --> 28:38.242
Don't talk to your father like that.

28:38.242 --> 28:41.122
That would require you to act like my father.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.362
That's our guy.

28:53.562 --> 28:56.122
All right, go ahead. I'll be waiting.

28:56.162 --> 28:59.162
Come on. You're my cover.

28:59.402 --> 29:02.602
Besides, I can't go with my face like this.

29:03.202 --> 29:04.362
What?

29:04.362 --> 29:07.402
You're just taking a little walk out in your neighborhood.

29:17.322 --> 29:19.042
All right, I'll just be a minute.

29:19.042 --> 29:21.922
You just wait right there.

29:41.762 --> 29:43.002
All right, let's go. Where is it?

29:43.002 --> 29:44.402
You're looking at it.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.922
The car? You got to be kidding me.

29:46.922 --> 29:48.682
120Gs is no joke.

29:48.682 --> 29:50.602
No. No way, man. I'm not doing this.

29:50.602 --> 29:51.842
Too late.

29:54.802 --> 29:57.042
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

29:57.042 --> 29:59.282
They're supposed to be next to the keys, but I can't find them!

29:59.282 --> 30:01.362
There's a patrol car up the street!

30:01.362 --> 30:02.522
I got this!

30:14.008 --> 30:16.008
They're coming! Let's go!

30:16.408 --> 30:18.248
- What are you doing?!
- Shut up!

30:24.648 --> 30:27.488
- Let's go! Come on!
- Get in!

30:29.728 --> 30:31.688
Don't be a little bitch.

30:49.568 --> 30:53.048
You guys better get that back to the headmistress' office before someone sees it here.

30:53.048 --> 30:54.128
Oh, yeah. We will.

30:54.128 --> 30:55.288
And thanks again.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.768
That was pretty cool.

30:56.808 --> 30:58.568
Yeah. I mean, when we came and talked about you,

30:58.568 --> 31:02.048
I thought you'd be totally wasted and have all these problems.

31:02.048 --> 31:05.248
Right. Well, I'm glad you guys aren't going to get in trouble.

31:05.248 --> 31:06.448
I actually kind of had fun.

31:06.448 --> 31:11.448
Wow. I suspected as much, but it's actually kind of nice to hear you say it out loud.

31:11.848 --> 31:13.768
I think we're having a moment?

31:15.248 --> 31:17.648
Oh, my God! My phone just totally stepped on your moment.

31:17.648 --> 31:19.968
Um... I'll just... I'll take it outside.

31:20.648 --> 31:23.128
Hey, bitch! You never call me back. What's up?

31:24.528 --> 31:26.528
Yeah, I liked hanging out, too.

31:26.528 --> 31:29.208
It sucks you're going to go to college next year.

31:29.528 --> 31:31.528
Um... We'll see about that.

31:31.688 --> 31:34.688
Oh. Well, whatever you decide, I will miss you.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.928
And I mean it this time.

31:36.928 --> 31:38.968
Oh, me, too.

31:51.648 --> 31:53.968
I'm sorry I'm late. I'll... I'll hurry.

31:53.968 --> 31:55.408
Hey, have a seat.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.568
So...

32:08.208 --> 32:09.888
Have you been drinking again?

32:12.608 --> 32:16.048
No explanation, no... no judgment.

32:16.048 --> 32:17.568
I just want to know.

32:21.608 --> 32:24.328
- Oh, I wish you'd talk to me.
- I tried.

32:27.888 --> 32:29.688
That night you called?

32:32.688 --> 32:33.928
I wish I had known.

32:33.928 --> 32:35.368
Then you would have come?

32:36.368 --> 32:39.008
Because the only thing that would actually get you to talk to me

32:39.008 --> 32:41.008
was the threat of a relapse?

32:41.168 --> 32:42.808
I hope you know that's not true.

32:42.808 --> 32:44.248
I don't know that.

32:47.688 --> 32:49.848
Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry.

32:50.008 --> 32:51.528
For everything.

32:51.848 --> 32:53.848
Especially the relapse.

32:54.568 --> 32:57.488
And, more importantly, for keeping it a secret.

32:57.568 --> 32:59.128
I'm sorry, too.

33:08.648 --> 33:11.568
I know you know about my drinking.

33:11.568 --> 33:13.768
And I assume you know about Brown?

33:16.528 --> 33:20.088
Sorry to rat you out to Dad. It was kind of a heat-of-the-moment thing.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.968
I'm glad you did.

33:27.488 --> 33:31.128
I know things have been difficult, but we're still a family.

33:31.128 --> 33:34.688
Yeah. We're a great family: Mom's drinking. Dad's about to go to jail.

33:34.688 --> 33:36.768
Giving the Outfit a run for their money.

33:36.768 --> 33:39.528
I haven't given up on us, and neither has your father.

33:39.528 --> 33:43.088
My God! Apologize for that guy. I don't even want to be in the same room as him.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.888
I'm asking you to.

33:44.888 --> 33:46.848
I attend his Man of the Year party?

33:46.848 --> 33:50.648
Don't you think that's a hypocritical way to start the Cohen family clean slate?

33:50.648 --> 33:52.568
Will you do it for me?

33:56.848 --> 33:58.168
Fine.

33:58.968 --> 34:04.168
But I want my own table, and my applause for his speech will be so tepid.

34:04.168 --> 34:05.688
Thank you.

34:07.848 --> 34:09.967
Will you stop by the Newport Group?

34:09.967 --> 34:13.328
There's a concept drawing for the hospital that your father needs for his presentation.

34:13.328 --> 34:15.888
I'd ask Ryan, but he said he'd be late.

34:18.248 --> 34:20.527
I believe your father is going to fix this.

34:20.527 --> 34:22.368
That makes one of us.

34:44.487 --> 34:46.728
- Ryan.
- Hi. Hey, where are you right now?

34:46.728 --> 34:49.568
I'm driving back from Montecito. Are you okay?

34:49.568 --> 34:53.047
Yeah. Can you, uh... Can you meet me at your place?

34:53.047 --> 34:54.808
Yeah. Sure.

34:54.808 --> 34:57.088
There's a key under the mat by the pool.

34:57.088 --> 34:59.088
Just let yourself in, and wait in my room.

34:59.088 --> 35:00.728
I'll be there as soon as I can.

35:00.728 --> 35:01.928
Thanks.

35:01.928 --> 35:05.648
- Hey, Ryan...
- I... It's okay. It's okay. Um...

35:06.968 --> 35:08.208
Thanks.

35:37.408 --> 35:39.928
Neil, why aren't you ready for the party?

35:40.288 --> 35:41.848
We should be leaving.

35:42.088 --> 35:43.728
I'm not going, darling.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.528
Julie, I spent the entire afternoon with the DA.

35:48.528 --> 35:51.888
Griffin's about to be arrested, and Sandy's future is far from certain.

35:51.888 --> 35:54.648
All the more reason to be there for him and Kirsten.

35:55.608 --> 35:57.448
It feels like a conflict of interest.

35:57.448 --> 35:59.688
I might have to testify against the man.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.568
I'm sorry. But I'm sure they'll understand.

36:02.568 --> 36:04.208
Well, I don't.

36:04.408 --> 36:06.448
The Cohens are like family, Neil.

36:06.448 --> 36:08.808
Maybe they're about to become the black sheep.

36:09.408 --> 36:13.768
Hmm. Well, I don't know about you, but I support the people I care about.

36:13.768 --> 36:15.448
I don't judge them.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.048
I'll call a cab.

36:31.568 --> 36:32.608
- Hello.
- Hey.

36:32.608 --> 36:35.248
I was wondering if you have an ETA. Your father's about to take the stage.

36:35.248 --> 36:36.448
I'll be right there.

36:36.448 --> 36:38.408
Did you get the drawing?

36:40.448 --> 36:42.168
Okay. I'll see you soon.

37:21.288 --> 37:22.968
Well, you're very sweet to say that, thank you.

37:22.968 --> 37:25.048
Excuse me. Can I borrow my husband for a moment?

37:25.048 --> 37:26.448
Excuse me.

37:27.568 --> 37:29.448
Isn't that Greg Otis?

37:33.088 --> 37:35.328
Oh, maybe he's here to arrest me.

37:35.448 --> 37:38.688
Wouldn't be the first time somebody left a Newport party in handcuffs.

37:39.848 --> 37:42.208
I'm going to go practice my speech anyway.

37:59.368 --> 38:00.928
Hey, what's going on?

38:00.928 --> 38:02.528
I was with you tonight.

38:02.528 --> 38:04.688
If anyone asks, can you say that?

38:04.688 --> 38:07.408
- Ryan...
- Just yes or no? Will you do it?

38:07.488 --> 38:09.328
Yeah, of course.

38:23.248 --> 38:24.568
You changed your mind?

38:24.568 --> 38:26.048
No, you changed it.

38:26.288 --> 38:28.448
You're a very passionate woman.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.968
Surprisingly principled.

38:31.088 --> 38:32.848
I'd like to think so.

38:34.048 --> 38:38.488
If you feel so strongly about family, how could I not want to be part of yours?

38:39.088 --> 38:43.328
Good evening, everyone. And thank you so much for coming out tonight,

38:43.328 --> 38:47.168
and thanks to Riviera Magazine for bestowing upon me this...

38:47.448 --> 38:52.088
this wonderful honor that I... I cannot accept.

38:54.888 --> 38:57.128
I used to think I was better than this place.

38:57.128 --> 39:00.088
You know, I came from outside the bubble, so I thought I was fit to judge it.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.048
So when it came time for me to run the Newport Group,

39:02.048 --> 39:04.888
I wasn't worried at all about losing my way.

39:04.888 --> 39:09.528
But I learned that despite the wide streets and the sunny views,

39:09.528 --> 39:15.888
you take one wrong turn in this town, and you can end up totally lost.

39:17.568 --> 39:21.048
Oh, thank you, Seth. Thanks, Kirsten.

39:22.168 --> 39:27.968
This drawing is as close to fully realized as Newport Mercy will ever be,

39:27.968 --> 39:30.088
because in the next few months, I'm going to be cooperating

39:30.088 --> 39:33.328
with the District Attorney's investigation of Dr. Henry Griffin

39:33.368 --> 39:35.728
and the hospital he and I were going to build.

39:35.728 --> 39:37.088
I'm so sorry, Cohen.

39:37.088 --> 39:38.608
No, it's okay. I think it's for the best.

39:38.608 --> 39:43.728
I'm truly flattered to be held in such high esteem by this community,

39:43.728 --> 39:45.448
but I'm going to step aside,

39:45.448 --> 39:49.768
because I'm going to pursue an order that is closer to my heart:

39:50.048 --> 39:53.928
Father and Husband of the Year.

39:58.928 --> 40:00.088
Thank you.

40:02.728 --> 40:04.168
That was quite a speech.

40:04.168 --> 40:07.368
And you... are going to have quite a case.

40:07.368 --> 40:08.928
I'll be in touch.

40:12.448 --> 40:14.928
You were wonderful.

40:16.408 --> 40:17.568
Thanks.

40:20.568 --> 40:24.728
I thought it was wordy in the middle, but I think the end was nice.

40:24.728 --> 40:26.088
Yeah?

40:34.448 --> 40:36.248
Maybe I'm too late.

40:45.208 --> 40:46.488
They're here for me.

40:46.488 --> 40:49.248
Well, it's a good thing you were with me all night then, right?

40:53.008 --> 40:55.368
Do not ask him any questions unless I'm present.

40:55.368 --> 40:57.608
- Who are you, his lawyer?
- I'm his father.

41:00.008 --> 41:00.808
What happened?

41:00.808 --> 41:02.648
There's been a fire at the Newport Group.

41:02.648 --> 41:04.528
They think Seth did it.
