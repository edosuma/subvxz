01:47.884 --> 01:48.975
- Hello?
- Sam.

01:48.999 --> 01:50.944
Dust catcher
drill attachment makes quick work

01:50.968 --> 01:52.572
of any of your small household jobs

01:52.596 --> 01:54.555
that require you
to drill into your drywall,

01:56.142 --> 01:58.443
Wood frames, panels, door frames,
just about anything.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.863
I know you're sick
of all that dust falling into the...

02:00.887 --> 02:02.700
- Yeah?
- Kensi, we've got something.

02:02.724 --> 02:04.120
How fast can you be here?

02:04.144 --> 02:05.895
Can you translate this?

02:10.031 --> 02:11.822
This should be translated.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.342
- Callen.
- Hey, G. We got a lead.

02:20.366 --> 02:22.095
You gotta get in here right away.

02:22.119 --> 02:24.167
- A video just came in.
- When?

02:25.088 --> 02:26.095
What do we know?

02:26.119 --> 02:29.310
This appeared
on a known jihadist website

02:29.334 --> 02:31.715
less than an hour ago.

02:32.178 --> 02:34.277
"The evil empire of the West

02:34.301 --> 02:38.861
hides behind its false words of peace
and its United Nations,

02:38.885 --> 02:40.234
the infidel war machine

02:40.258 --> 02:44.244
designed solely to deny Islam
and destroy the Muslim world.

02:44.268 --> 02:48.248
If you do not release our falsely-
accused brother, Ala A Din Keshwar,

02:48.272 --> 02:50.271
within 24 hours,

02:52.991 --> 02:54.485
this man shall be executed."

02:56.494 --> 02:58.403
Oh, my God. Dom.

03:00.540 --> 03:01.679
Eric?

03:01.703 --> 03:05.266
It looks like it was uploaded
at an Internet café in Rabat, Morocco.

03:05.290 --> 03:06.896
Strip the hell out of that footage.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.398
I want full audio and visual forensics,
voice analysis and the works.

03:10.422 --> 03:13.853
Identify what's in the room, on their
clothes, background noises, anything.

03:13.877 --> 03:17.553
Send copies to FBI and NSA.
Anyone who can help.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.613
Kensi, find out who these people are.
Where do they operate,

03:21.637 --> 03:23.068
where are they getting funding?

03:23.092 --> 03:25.820
Nate, put together whatever you can
about Ala A Din Keshwar,

03:25.844 --> 03:27.957
- and keep Director Vance in the loop.
- Got it.

03:27.981 --> 03:30.203
- What about Dom's parents?
- What about them?

03:30.227 --> 03:32.372
- Shouldn't we contact them?
- To tell them what?

03:32.396 --> 03:34.375
Your son's not dead,
but about to be executed?

03:34.399 --> 03:36.210
At the very least,
they could be praying.

03:36.234 --> 03:38.543
- They need to know.
- I'll have Nate speak with them.

03:38.567 --> 03:40.678
Hopefully by the time
we talk to Dom's parents,

03:40.702 --> 03:42.840
it will be to tell them
that he's safe and sound.

03:42.864 --> 03:44.760
We need to secure a transport.

03:44.784 --> 03:48.102
We could put together a basic outfit,
gear up once on the ground overseas.

03:48.126 --> 03:49.980
Overseas where?

03:50.004 --> 03:51.726
We don't even know
where they took him.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.810
Not yet,
but as long as we're wheels up,

03:53.834 --> 03:56.311
we can land anywhere
in the Middle East or North Africa

03:56.335 --> 03:58.944
as soon as we find out
who the hell this Ala A Din guy is,

03:58.968 --> 04:00.860
who's got him,
and where he's being held.

04:00.884 --> 04:02.612
What happens
if we're over the Atlantic

04:02.636 --> 04:05.811
and we discover that he's being held
in the Philippines or Indonesia?

04:12.695 --> 04:15.732
- They had him over two months, G.
- But he looks strong.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.115
It looked like
he was hanging in there, right?

04:21.913 --> 04:23.965
All this time, we still don't know
who grabbed him,

04:23.989 --> 04:25.220
why they grabbed him,

04:25.244 --> 04:27.800
or what they hope to get
out of a brand-new agent.

04:27.824 --> 04:30.386
Maybe he was a hostage
of opportunity.

04:30.410 --> 04:34.004
They brought in Colombians
to snatch him. They hired pros.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.419
You think someone's trying
to get to us?

04:38.054 --> 04:41.755
If they have Dom, they already have.

04:44.102 --> 04:48.407
All you're giving me is excuses,
and I don't have time for it, Dick.

04:48.431 --> 04:52.936
Monty, you owe me, and you know it.
Just man up.

04:54.779 --> 04:58.195
Blah, blah, blah.

05:02.453 --> 05:07.138
All right, listen up,
you flaccid, bureaucratic eunuchs.

05:07.162 --> 05:10.559
I want full cooperation
from each of your agencies,

05:10.583 --> 05:13.896
and unrestricted access
to Tunisian airspace,

05:13.920 --> 05:16.639
or by God,
my next call is to Fradkov,

05:16.663 --> 05:20.543
and I will outsource
this whole damn operation.

05:27.812 --> 05:30.908
Feel better? Something tells me
you've done this before.

05:30.932 --> 05:33.241
- Where are we?
- We are playing catch up in the dark

05:33.265 --> 05:35.043
with a ticking clock.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.121
Well, I may know someone
who can help.

05:37.145 --> 05:39.967
- So, what are we waiting for?
- Well, I'm certain he can help.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.862
I'm just not certain that he'll want to.

05:43.369 --> 05:47.581
- But he owes me a favour, or ten.
- Well, maybe if you ask him nicely.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.926
Seemed to work with the other
gentlemen on the phone.

05:50.950 --> 05:55.041
I doubt that any of them are gentle,
and they're certainly not men.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.835
So who's this contact?

06:06.476 --> 06:07.780
She didn't give you a name?

06:07.804 --> 06:10.623
- What agency is he with?
- She didn't say.

06:10.647 --> 06:11.987
We're wasting time.

06:12.011 --> 06:14.704
This guy could be with
Animal Control for all I care.

06:14.728 --> 06:16.810
I trust Hetty.

06:17.195 --> 06:18.903
How is the Duchess of Deception?

06:20.156 --> 06:22.825
- She's well.
- How do you know her?

06:24.077 --> 06:26.840
She helped me out of a jam
here and there back in the day.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.801
- You know what we're up against?
- Not really.

06:29.825 --> 06:31.351
Ala A Din is a brand-new player.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.558
Nobody's even got a positive ID
on this guy.

06:33.582 --> 06:37.062
- Who's he work for?
- We believe his group is called TAJ,

06:37.086 --> 06:38.775
Talib al Jihadiya,

06:38.799 --> 06:41.718
and they are working very hard
to make a name for themselves.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.400
Now, there were reports he was killed
after a bombing in Pakistan.

06:45.424 --> 06:47.365
TAJ denied it.

06:47.389 --> 06:51.746
But the latest rumour
is he's been captured

06:51.770 --> 06:53.456
by one of our own agencies,

06:53.480 --> 06:55.913
but nobody's copping to it.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.271
Do you know who has him?

06:57.860 --> 07:00.541
Defence Intelligence,
Special Activities Division,

07:00.565 --> 07:03.003
National Clandestine Service.
Take your pick.

07:03.027 --> 07:05.322
Whoever's got him ain't sharing.

07:05.827 --> 07:07.487
How come we haven't heard
any of this?

07:08.830 --> 07:10.110
Nobody has.

07:11.958 --> 07:15.018
My guess is whoever's got him
is keeping his capture a secret,

07:15.042 --> 07:17.749
hoping to smoke out
the rest of his group.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.374
Because the guys with the biggest
trophies get the most funding.

07:22.385 --> 07:23.855
Do you have any idea
where he is now?

07:23.879 --> 07:24.879
No.

07:25.638 --> 07:27.607
This is all I've got
on the TAJ terrorists.

07:27.631 --> 07:30.724
They're thought to have training camps
set up in Sudan, Eritrea,

07:31.227 --> 07:32.578
possibly even Somalia.

07:32.602 --> 07:34.395
But nothing's been confirmed yet.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.602
I'm sorry about your man.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.525
No one deserves to go out like that.

07:40.570 --> 07:42.112
He's not dead yet.

07:45.158 --> 07:46.818
Good luck.

07:47.577 --> 07:49.711
Oh, and tell Hetty

07:49.735 --> 07:52.582
they still had her picture up
in that bar in Velika Krusa.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.455
She'll get a kick out of that.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.714
No. There.

08:08.097 --> 08:09.567
- The other one.
- Stop hovering.

08:09.591 --> 08:12.067
- I'm just trying to help.
- You aren't. It's a computer.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.616
- It only takes one person to work it.
- Apparently not.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.742
Guys, I haven't been able to find
anything on this Ala A Din character.

08:17.766 --> 08:19.624
- Neither can Eric.
- Or you.

08:19.648 --> 08:22.331
- Pointing fingers is not going to help.
- Maybe this will.

08:22.355 --> 08:23.833
- What is it?
- Information

08:23.857 --> 08:25.548
on suspected TAJ terrorists.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.459
- See what you can dig out.
- Where'd you get it?

08:27.483 --> 08:30.339
- Couldn't tell you if I wanted to.
- We've got video. No audio.

08:30.363 --> 08:33.049
We haven't been able to find anything.
I mean nothing.

08:33.073 --> 08:34.789
"Ala A Din" must be an alias.

08:35.291 --> 08:37.592
- How much time do we have?
- Twenty hours at the most.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.679
We may be able to reset
the deadline

08:39.703 --> 08:41.812
if we can give the terrorists
some indication

08:41.836 --> 08:43.808
they're making progress
with their demands.

08:43.832 --> 08:47.757
Eric, stop the video. Now zoom in.

08:49.972 --> 08:51.431
Is that your friend Moe?

08:54.644 --> 08:55.723
Yeah.

09:12.235 --> 09:15.378
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

09:15.402 --> 09:17.505
Moe's foster parents
haven't heard back from Moe

09:17.529 --> 09:20.592
since he fled back to Africa, which is
the same night Dom was abducted.

09:20.616 --> 09:22.884
Safar Jadallah recruited Moe
and the other boys

09:22.908 --> 09:25.262
from the Ethiopian Youth Centre
to become jihadis.

09:25.286 --> 09:28.350
- He's gotta know something.
- No, he's in Guantanamo Bay.

09:28.374 --> 09:30.975
It'd take eight hours to get him here.
Question him there.

09:30.999 --> 09:33.377
Okay, I'll give them a heads-up.

09:34.049 --> 09:35.223
Moe's father was Janjaweed.

09:35.247 --> 09:37.631
The Sudanese government hired him
to fight the rebels.

09:38.136 --> 09:39.654
Only problem was, they were worse.

09:39.678 --> 09:44.283
Well, hence the nickname.
Devils on horseback with guns.

09:44.307 --> 09:46.990
I killed Moe's father
saving some aid workers.

09:47.014 --> 09:48.621
Maybe this is payback.

09:48.645 --> 09:51.660
If Moe is part of Ala A Din's group
and they have Dom,

09:51.684 --> 09:53.625
there's a good chance Dom
is in Sudan.

09:53.649 --> 09:56.001
There's also a good chance
he's being held in Chad,

09:56.025 --> 09:58.295
or Libya or Somalia.

09:58.319 --> 10:00.957
If we can't track Moe's movements
after he arrived in Chad,

10:00.981 --> 10:02.713
we have no idea where he could be.

10:02.737 --> 10:05.722
If we take a plane to Manda Bay,
Kenya, we'd be in striking distance.

10:05.746 --> 10:08.926
We are better working the case here,
using time and resources to find Dom.

10:08.950 --> 10:10.975
We should be there.
We owe it to Dom.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.877
Let's just find him first, okay?

10:13.588 --> 10:15.687
Having Moe involved,
that was our first big break.

10:15.711 --> 10:18.503
- At least we have a place to start.
- The youth centre.

10:26.601 --> 10:27.952
- May I help you?
- Federal agents

10:27.976 --> 10:30.196
from the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

10:30.220 --> 10:32.745
This is a Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act warrant...

10:32.769 --> 10:35.242
You have already searched here.
Two months ago.

10:35.266 --> 10:37.495
Safar Jadallah
has already been arrested.

10:37.519 --> 10:39.498
We're interested
in a terrorist organisation

10:39.522 --> 10:41.465
known as the Talib al Jihadiya.

10:41.489 --> 10:43.946
Callen, we've got a runner.

10:46.663 --> 10:47.742
Federal agent.

10:48.998 --> 10:50.908
Stop.

10:55.713 --> 10:57.291
No, no, no.

11:16.317 --> 11:18.001
Let me go! Let me go!

11:18.025 --> 11:20.661
- Leave me alone.
- Stay still. Stay still.

11:20.685 --> 11:22.607
- Leave me alone.
- Don't move.

11:26.578 --> 11:27.776
Way to go, Flipper.

11:30.540 --> 11:32.307
Think we'll be able
to get something off it?

11:32.331 --> 11:33.959
I sure as hell hope so.

12:06.367 --> 12:07.862
I didn't order any room service.

13:02.590 --> 13:05.022
- Where is he?
- I don't even know who that is.

13:05.046 --> 13:07.923
Mowahd Dusa. Goes by Moe.

13:08.429 --> 13:10.030
Used to hang out
at the youth centre

13:10.054 --> 13:14.055
until he went back to Sudan to become
a terrorist with the Talib al Jihadiya.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.341
If you say so.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.894
This man?

13:21.693 --> 13:24.290
Special Agent Dominic Vail.
He goes by Dom.

13:24.314 --> 13:26.835
He was kidnapped
and is being held by TAJ terrorists

13:26.859 --> 13:30.008
- who are threatening to execute him.
- I don't know anything about that.

13:30.032 --> 13:33.427
- Why did you run at the youth centre?
- I was late for a class.

13:33.451 --> 13:35.139
That why you threw
your computer in the pool?

13:35.163 --> 13:38.178
- Slipped out of my hand.
- And the knife you pulled?

13:38.202 --> 13:40.832
I was just trying to hand it over
to him.

13:41.170 --> 13:43.898
- He is smug.
- Can I go now?

13:43.922 --> 13:45.726
You know how I feel about smug.

13:45.750 --> 13:49.294
No, it's good. Means he thinks
he's smarter than Callen.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.029
So, what's the verdict?

13:53.053 --> 13:55.549
Don't take your computer swimming.

13:56.978 --> 13:59.789
Look, to do this properly,
I should flush it with distilled water

13:59.813 --> 14:02.080
and dry it with a desiccant
over several days.

14:02.104 --> 14:04.623
I don't care about properly,
I care about quickly.

14:04.647 --> 14:07.333
There's information
on that computer we need now.

14:07.357 --> 14:10.507
I know. But if I power this up and
there's moisture on the components,

14:10.531 --> 14:13.511
I could fry the motherboard
and cause a lethal short to the CPU.

14:13.535 --> 14:15.422
But if we don't,
we waste valuable time.

14:15.446 --> 14:18.515
This computer may hold
the only chance we have

14:18.539 --> 14:21.887
of finding Dom in time to save him.

14:21.911 --> 14:24.375
Come on. Do it.

14:32.180 --> 14:35.216
Son of a bitch.
You know, I told you...

14:36.934 --> 14:39.390
- Now what am I supposed to do?
- Fix it.

14:40.605 --> 14:43.701
You help me,
I may be able to help you.

14:43.725 --> 14:45.453
If you don't, it is out of my hands

14:45.477 --> 14:48.712
and you are on a one-way trip
to Guantanamo Bay.

14:48.736 --> 14:53.377
And I promise you
their idea of water sports

14:53.401 --> 14:58.843
- does not involve a day at the beach.
- Your threats do not frighten me.

14:58.867 --> 15:02.491
Do you know the difference
between courage and stupidity, Yari?

15:03.252 --> 15:04.252
No?

15:05.463 --> 15:07.621
Do you know why terrorists
target youth groups?

15:08.716 --> 15:11.836
Because young people
are impressionable.

15:12.136 --> 15:14.782
It's a lot easier to convince teenagers
to be suicide bombers.

15:14.806 --> 15:20.477
To become a martyr.
Shahid is to die for what you believe in.

15:21.729 --> 15:25.312
The old Istishhad
versus Intihar debate.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.210
Okay, I got another one for you.

15:28.234 --> 15:31.902
Do you know the difference between
suicide bombers and martyrs?

15:33.658 --> 15:34.796
Trick question.

15:34.820 --> 15:37.032
There is no difference.

15:37.495 --> 15:39.951
We pick up both their pieces
in a sandwich bag.

15:44.669 --> 15:46.994
It's kind of hard to make out,

15:47.964 --> 15:52.507
but the thing that looks like
a bowl of fruit salad,

15:53.010 --> 15:58.028
now that's what's left of the skull
of an 11 -year-old boy

15:58.052 --> 16:01.675
who detonated a bomb
that was strapped to his chest.

16:02.854 --> 16:05.855
I wonder if the heavenly virgins
dig the headless-horseman look.

16:07.817 --> 16:09.359
Look.

16:09.777 --> 16:11.734
If you wanna help this man,

16:12.363 --> 16:14.960
you can trade him for Ala A Din.

16:14.984 --> 16:17.257
How much time we gonna waste
on this human detritus?

16:17.281 --> 16:21.236
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.
- Well, that's too bad. For your friend.

16:22.582 --> 16:27.160
I can only imagine the look on his face
when they cut off his head.

16:28.337 --> 16:29.973
Sam? Sam.

16:29.997 --> 16:31.797
And you will be an accessory
to murder.

16:32.675 --> 16:34.086
Sam.

16:35.011 --> 16:36.315
Sam, let him go.

16:36.339 --> 16:38.030
I'm giving him what he wants.

16:38.054 --> 16:40.238
- You want shahada?
- Sam, stop it.

16:40.262 --> 16:42.532
This is it. You wanna be shahid?

16:42.556 --> 16:44.411
You're on your way to paradise,
my friend.

16:44.435 --> 16:47.439
Sam, listen to me.
He is no good to us dead.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.605
He's no good to anyone.

16:53.362 --> 16:55.900
And for the record,
you don't deserve to die by my hands.

17:29.797 --> 17:31.755
I messed up, G.

17:32.258 --> 17:33.587
He'll live.

17:34.177 --> 17:36.478
I thought bringing Moe here
was the right thing to do.

17:36.502 --> 17:37.936
It was.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.365
Think about where he'd be right now
if you hadn't taken him out of Sudan.

17:41.389 --> 17:44.073
- He'd be dead.
- Yeah.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.575
And Dom would be safe.

17:45.599 --> 17:49.199
The only one who thinks
this is your fault is you.

17:49.223 --> 17:51.891
If you wanna blame yourself,
do it after we find Dom, okay?

17:52.612 --> 17:54.569
Because right now
I need your A game, big guy.

17:55.823 --> 17:57.650
So does Dom.

18:00.203 --> 18:02.634
You think this guy Yari's gonna talk?

18:02.658 --> 18:04.373
He might,

18:04.624 --> 18:07.293
after you opened a can of jihad
on his ass.

18:09.963 --> 18:13.166
The guy is an armchair terrorist
at best.

18:13.633 --> 18:16.302
I think we made it pretty clear
we're not messing around.

18:22.183 --> 18:23.534
Give me some good news, Kensi.

18:23.558 --> 18:26.158
I have a resignation letter
from a former worker.

18:26.182 --> 18:27.896
What's her name?

18:28.898 --> 18:30.285
Great.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.021
All right.
Send whatever you find to my phone.

18:33.903 --> 18:37.295
Kensi found a resignation letter
from a worker at the centre.

18:37.319 --> 18:39.340
A woman by the name
of Ameenah Shah

18:39.364 --> 18:43.128
quit because she disapproved
of what was going on there.

18:43.152 --> 18:46.472
- I'm liking this woman already.
- Oh, come on.

18:46.496 --> 18:47.922
Come on.

18:47.946 --> 18:53.974
You know I despise your wardrobe.
Particularly those flip-flops.

18:53.998 --> 18:58.479
Not to mention your surfboard
leaning precariously close to my car,

18:58.503 --> 19:01.192
the sand you track
into the op centre,

19:01.216 --> 19:05.030
or the millions of dollars
of top-secret technology you use

19:05.054 --> 19:06.993
to play your frivolous
video games.

19:07.017 --> 19:08.978
I only left my surfboard
near your car once.

19:11.691 --> 19:13.624
Or twice. But I don't do it anymore.

19:13.648 --> 19:17.958
But I tolerate it all, for the most part.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.504
And do you know why, Mr. Beale?

19:20.528 --> 19:23.736
My playful kitten-like personality?

19:25.371 --> 19:27.411
I don't know why I just said that.

19:28.124 --> 19:30.258
I make jokes when I'm nervous.

19:30.282 --> 19:32.060
I use humour
as a defence mechanism.

19:32.084 --> 19:35.788
It's a bad habit.
I don't even know why I'm still talking.

19:36.299 --> 19:38.149
I tolerate it

19:38.173 --> 19:41.937
because you are unequalled
at what you do.

19:41.961 --> 19:45.779
I am the way I am
because I demand the best.

19:45.803 --> 19:48.525
This is an elite unit,

19:48.549 --> 19:50.495
whose unparalleled success

19:50.519 --> 19:54.532
rests on the superior skills
of those who work here.

19:54.556 --> 19:59.562
And that's why I know
that if anyone can fix this,

20:00.114 --> 20:01.774
it is you.

20:03.451 --> 20:06.547
- I'm trying.
- I know. I know, and I'm sorry.

20:06.571 --> 20:09.094
I should have trusted
your judgement earlier.

20:09.118 --> 20:12.741
And because I pushed you,
I may have buggered everything.

20:13.252 --> 20:17.558
But I have complete faith in you,
Mr. Beale.

20:17.582 --> 20:19.631
Do what you do.

20:24.263 --> 20:25.947
That's for good luck.

20:25.971 --> 20:27.421
Thanks.

20:37.151 --> 20:39.358
Yes. Come on, baby.

20:42.698 --> 20:44.738
Come to Papa.

20:46.077 --> 20:48.698
Thank you for coming,
and enjoy the rest of your visit.

20:49.747 --> 20:51.787
Have a good day.
Bye-bye. Thank you.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.509
- Ameenah Shah?
- Yes.

20:54.533 --> 20:57.260
Special Agent Callen.
This is Special Agent Sam Hanna.

20:57.284 --> 20:58.518
We're from NCIS.

20:58.542 --> 20:59.971
We'd like to ask you some questions

20:59.995 --> 21:03.958
about your time spent working
at the Ethiopian Youth Organisation.

21:04.178 --> 21:06.443
You know a young Sudanese man
from the centre?

21:06.467 --> 21:08.513
- Mowahd Dusa?
- No.

21:09.183 --> 21:11.994
I worked mainly
in an administration capacity.

21:12.018 --> 21:14.534
Organising schedules, classes.

21:14.558 --> 21:17.826
Your resignation letter cited concerns
about what they were teaching there.

21:17.850 --> 21:19.828
Ideological differences
are not a crime.

21:19.852 --> 21:21.795
They are if they lead
to terrorist activities.

21:21.819 --> 21:23.588
I should be getting back to work.

21:23.612 --> 21:27.458
The man in this video
is a federal agent.

21:27.482 --> 21:30.994
He is also a friend and he will be
executed if we can't find him.

21:33.249 --> 21:35.798
I'm sorry,
but I know nothing about this.

21:35.822 --> 21:38.682
Ameenah, you have a degree
in early childhood education.

21:38.706 --> 21:40.504
Clearly, you care
about young people.

21:41.007 --> 21:44.186
Something happened at that
youth centre that caused you to quit.

21:44.210 --> 21:45.820
Now, I think it's the same thing

21:45.844 --> 21:48.360
that caused several of these boys,
like Moe, to disappear.

21:48.384 --> 21:52.031
These same young men are about
to murder a federal agent

21:52.055 --> 21:53.720
and they will be terrorists.

21:54.228 --> 21:57.265
This is your chance
to save a lot of lives.

22:00.067 --> 22:04.871
There was a man
who started to teach religious studies

22:04.895 --> 22:07.207
that became more and more radical.

22:07.231 --> 22:10.919
- Safar Jadallah?
- Yes.

22:10.943 --> 22:13.825
Yeah, we picked him up a while back.
Who else?

22:17.001 --> 22:21.877
There was another man who started to
come around after Safar got arrested.

22:23.466 --> 22:26.193
He was very angry
that Safar was gone.

22:26.217 --> 22:29.777
I think he donated money
to the centre.

22:29.801 --> 22:31.217
His name was Kalil.

22:33.059 --> 22:36.201
I don't know his last name. I'm sorry.

22:36.225 --> 22:37.593
I must get back to work.

22:44.737 --> 22:46.255
- Yo.
- Eric, it's Callen.

22:46.279 --> 22:48.546
I need everything you can find
on a guy named Kalil.

22:48.570 --> 22:50.295
He was connected
with the youth centre.

22:50.319 --> 22:52.426
Don't have a last name,
but he provided funding.

22:52.450 --> 22:54.719
Yeah, yeah.
His name's in Yari's computer.

22:54.743 --> 22:56.633
- You got it working?
- Getting there.

22:56.657 --> 23:00.059
Yeah, here it is. Kalil Abramson.
Heavy hitter in commercial real estate.

23:00.083 --> 23:03.598
Single. Envious bank account.

23:03.622 --> 23:06.525
One outstanding parking ticket
for an expired meter on Robertson.

23:06.549 --> 23:08.627
Find him.

23:52.263 --> 23:53.270
Here you are, sir.

23:53.294 --> 23:54.931
Welcome.

24:03.649 --> 24:06.330
- Kalil Abramson.
- Yes.

24:06.354 --> 24:09.172
Federal agents.
We'd like to ask you some questions

24:09.196 --> 24:12.589
concerning your involvement
with the Ethiopian Youth Organisation.

24:12.613 --> 24:14.384
That's one of my pet projects.

24:14.408 --> 24:16.795
I'm very active in youth
and environmental issues.

24:16.819 --> 24:19.095
But please have a seat. Join us.

24:19.119 --> 24:21.887
Not a good idea, considering
your credit cards have been frozen,

24:21.911 --> 24:24.871
along with the rest of your assets.

24:25.171 --> 24:26.641
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.475
We will explain
after you come with us.

24:28.499 --> 24:31.521
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in
the middle of a business meeting.

24:31.545 --> 24:33.154
Then why'd you ask us to join you?

24:33.178 --> 24:35.314
- I was being polite.
- Well, I'm not.

24:35.338 --> 24:39.025
You're under arrest on charges
of knowingly funding terrorist activities.

24:39.049 --> 24:45.265
Well, then I'm very glad that I'm here
in the company of my attorneys.

25:34.698 --> 25:37.154
We're gonna need a new camera.

25:59.347 --> 26:01.114
Kalil Abramson was tipped off.

26:01.138 --> 26:03.774
He was surrounded by a wall
of lawyers before we got to him.

26:03.798 --> 26:06.028
He's not gonna help
if it means implicating himself.

26:06.052 --> 26:08.530
He might if it mitigates
charges of conspiracy, terrorism,

26:08.554 --> 26:10.949
- and the murder of an agent.
- There's been no murder.

26:10.973 --> 26:13.415
Dom's not dead.
Stop referring to him in the past tense.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.247
It was a worst-case scenario
for Abramson.

26:15.271 --> 26:17.913
Forget about worst-case scenarios.
There's one case scenario.

26:17.937 --> 26:19.942
That's finding and rescuing Dom.

26:21.535 --> 26:24.382
Moe once told me he felt safest
with his friends at the youth centre.

26:24.406 --> 26:26.098
Maybe he's still in touch with them.

26:26.122 --> 26:29.220
If they were culling potential
jihadists from the youth centre,

26:29.244 --> 26:30.426
it makes sense they'd...

26:30.450 --> 26:35.147
There's a SEAL team on standby
aboard the USS Cole.

26:35.171 --> 26:40.524
They're off the Horn of Africa as part
of NATO's Operation Ocean Shield.

26:40.548 --> 26:46.036
The minute we give them a location,
they'll hit it hard.

26:46.060 --> 26:50.355
I've called in
every favour I can think of.

26:51.023 --> 26:53.751
I don't think
I can go through this again.

26:53.775 --> 26:57.252
- We're gonna find him, Hetty.
- Do you really believe that?

26:57.276 --> 26:58.667
Yes.

26:58.691 --> 27:00.963
Because we're not gonna stop looking
until we do.

27:00.987 --> 27:03.614
I'm going to hold you to that.

27:05.579 --> 27:11.203
Extreme situations occasionally require
extreme measures, Mr. Callen.

27:12.378 --> 27:14.430
But at the end of the day,

27:14.454 --> 27:17.892
one's methods
are seldom questioned

27:17.916 --> 27:21.425
when they bring about
the necessary results.

27:29.270 --> 27:31.097
Keep moving.

27:31.897 --> 27:33.783
Where'd you learn
to speak English?

27:33.807 --> 27:35.358
Television.

27:38.863 --> 27:40.690
Well, what's your favourite show?

27:49.290 --> 27:50.369
What's your name?

27:51.500 --> 27:52.876
You shouldn't have done that.

27:53.377 --> 27:56.140
Why?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.

27:56.164 --> 27:57.477
That's not certain.

27:57.501 --> 28:02.050
My country does not negotiate
with terrorists.

28:02.762 --> 28:06.973
So if you don't help me escape,
you'll be a murderer too.

28:10.978 --> 28:13.184
And I know you don't want my blood
on your hands.

28:13.689 --> 28:15.064
How do you know that?

28:18.235 --> 28:23.028
Because you're talking to me
in English.

28:35.711 --> 28:38.012
- You know this man?
- No.

28:38.036 --> 28:41.001
- Do you know this guy?
- No.

28:42.009 --> 28:44.880
One of you tipped off
Kalil Abramson.

28:45.429 --> 28:47.007
Well, don't look at me, man.

29:07.076 --> 29:08.238
What the hell are you doing?

29:08.786 --> 29:12.047
I wanna know
which one of you tipped off Kalil.

29:12.071 --> 29:14.999
I don't even know who that is.
And I've never seen this guy before.

29:15.501 --> 29:17.826
- Tell him. I don't know you, do I?
- No.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.800
No.

29:34.770 --> 29:37.617
I didn't know that guy
and I didn't tip off Kalil. I swear to God.

29:37.641 --> 29:38.953
Whose god would that be, huh?

29:38.977 --> 29:40.952
What makes you think
I believe in any of them?

29:40.976 --> 29:42.871
You can't do this.
I haven't done anything.

29:42.895 --> 29:45.620
- Exactly what he said.
- Please. I can help you.

29:45.644 --> 29:46.830
You don't know anything.

29:46.854 --> 29:49.250
And unfortunately,
you just saw me kill a man.

29:49.274 --> 29:51.965
Wait, wait, wait.
I know about Mowahd Dusa.

29:51.989 --> 29:54.427
And other boys who left the centre
and went to Chad.

29:54.451 --> 29:56.426
- You know where they are?
- No.

29:56.450 --> 29:58.226
You know where they're holding
Agent Vail?

29:58.250 --> 30:00.886
No, but I know who does.
Kalil Abramson.

30:00.910 --> 30:03.638
He paid to recruit the young men
to become jihadis.

30:03.662 --> 30:05.726
He bought the plane tickets,
the training,

30:05.750 --> 30:08.393
he even paid the Colombians
to kidnap the agent.

30:08.417 --> 30:10.114
He's the man behind all this.

30:10.138 --> 30:13.093
He knows where your friend is.

30:14.268 --> 30:16.533
- Agent Nassir, you all right?
- Fine.

30:16.557 --> 30:18.163
- Did he talk?
- Yeah.

30:18.187 --> 30:21.202
- Kalil Abramson's behind all of this.
- What about his lawyers?

30:21.226 --> 30:24.187
It's gonna take more than lawyers
to save him this time.

30:42.361 --> 30:44.246
Anything else
from the TAJ terrorists?

30:44.270 --> 30:46.629
- Messages? Videos? Anything?
- Nothing.

30:46.653 --> 30:49.125
We've got less than 40 minutes
until our 24-hour deadline.

30:49.149 --> 30:50.963
What else have you got
on Abramson, Eric?

30:50.987 --> 30:52.881
Get anything else off
of Yari's computer?

30:52.905 --> 30:55.915
The money trail is hard to follow.
Kalil's been very careful.

30:56.417 --> 30:58.849
Also, he's been travelling a lot.

30:58.873 --> 31:03.184
Mostly in Europe, but on April 6th,
he hops a plane from Athens to Cairo.

31:03.208 --> 31:06.525
Then he goes from Egypt
to Khartoum in Sudan.

31:06.549 --> 31:09.364
Then he pops up in Asmara, Eritrea.
He's there for a couple days,

31:09.388 --> 31:11.856
then goes to someplace
called Berbera in Somalia

31:11.880 --> 31:13.148
before heading into Yemen.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.489
It's a terrorist tour group.

31:14.513 --> 31:17.199
Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia
are the same three countries

31:17.223 --> 31:20.433
thought to hold training camps
for Talib al Jihadiya.

31:20.941 --> 31:24.108
Dom's in one of those camps
and Kalil Abramson knows which one.

31:24.737 --> 31:26.540
Eric, can you turn on
Kalil's cell phone?

31:26.564 --> 31:28.067
Way ahead of you.

31:29.492 --> 31:31.959
Unfortunately, I haven't been able
to pick up any audio.

31:31.983 --> 31:35.553
His phone's at his house in Malibu.
Hasn't moved in several hours.

31:35.577 --> 31:38.215
Son of a bitch is sleeping
when Dom's about to be executed.

31:38.239 --> 31:41.928
I'm open to ideas, guys.
Think. We're running out of time.

31:41.952 --> 31:45.439
What about extraordinary rendition?

31:45.463 --> 31:48.942
Well, Kalil Abramson obtained
his American citizenship six years ago.

31:48.966 --> 31:51.484
Citizenship could be revoked
for acts of treason.

31:51.508 --> 31:53.507
Rarely, and only after
a lengthy process.

31:56.644 --> 32:00.700
I've secured a fully-crewed,
fully-fuelled C-130

32:00.724 --> 32:02.452
at Edwards Air Force Base.

32:02.476 --> 32:06.493
If you were to put Kalil Abramson
on that plane

32:06.517 --> 32:09.875
under the guise
of an unlawful enemy combatant,

32:09.899 --> 32:12.505
which he is,
for all intents and purposes...

32:12.529 --> 32:14.836
On his way to a black site
for interrogation.

32:14.860 --> 32:19.082
I've heard rumours that Bondsteel
in Kosovo is particularly ugly.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.843
You're suggesting torture by proxy?

32:21.867 --> 32:23.099
No, of course not.

32:23.123 --> 32:26.854
But if Kalil thinks
that's what's happening,

32:26.878 --> 32:30.608
well, I'm sure he'll start talking
before you hit Barstow.

32:30.632 --> 32:32.487
None of which would hold up
in court.

32:32.511 --> 32:36.440
This isn't about building a court case.
This is about rescuing Dom.

32:36.464 --> 32:38.326
Whether you rescue Dom or not,

32:38.350 --> 32:41.662
Kalil Abramson and his lawyers
will come after us with a vengeance.

32:41.686 --> 32:43.741
And Abramson will walk
because of it.

32:43.765 --> 32:45.376
Not to mention something like this

32:45.400 --> 32:47.501
could end the career of everyone
in this room.

32:47.525 --> 32:50.696
Saving a fellow agent is more
important than any career, Nate.

32:54.326 --> 32:57.530
- I'm with Sam.
- Me too.

33:05.421 --> 33:08.564
Someone once told me
that extreme situations

33:08.588 --> 33:11.877
occasionally call
for extreme measures.

33:18.768 --> 33:19.858
What the hell?

33:19.882 --> 33:21.970
I really wanted
to be a magician, anyway.

33:23.314 --> 33:26.207
Far be it for me
to thwart your dreams

33:26.231 --> 33:29.045
of a career in prestidigitation,
Mr. Getz.

33:29.069 --> 33:31.858
But if anyone is going to take the fall
for this, it will be me.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.043
He's in motion. Kalil. He's moving.

33:35.067 --> 33:36.618
Let's do it.

33:49.507 --> 33:51.440
Do you know
how much time I have?

33:51.464 --> 33:52.464
No.

33:57.681 --> 33:59.473
Wait. Wait.

34:00.226 --> 34:02.775
I want to send a message
to my parents.

34:02.799 --> 34:05.410
I can't help you with that.

34:05.434 --> 34:06.685
I'm sorry.

34:09.777 --> 34:11.983
Eat your breakfast.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.226
He's turning onto Broadway.

34:55.697 --> 34:56.777
Looks like he's stopping.

35:30.691 --> 35:32.743
Eric, he's headed
into the Palace Theatre.

35:32.767 --> 35:34.627
It's kind of early for a matinée.

35:34.651 --> 35:36.955
Kalil Abramson bought that theatre
a few years ago.

35:36.979 --> 35:39.290
He's turning it into a centre
for the performing arts.

35:39.314 --> 35:40.630
Oh, wonderful.

35:40.654 --> 35:43.376
The proceeds
from tonight's performance of Equus

35:43.400 --> 35:46.924
will be donated
to help support your local Taliban.

35:46.948 --> 35:49.140
We need to keep an open line
to the USS Cole.

35:49.164 --> 35:51.184
The minute we get Kalil
to tell where Dom is,

35:51.208 --> 35:53.620
- they have to scramble that team.
- Copy that.

35:55.758 --> 35:59.257
- We could use a layout of this place.
- Will do. Got it.

37:29.018 --> 37:31.343
Is anybody out there?

37:36.608 --> 37:37.865
Eric, we've got shots fired.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.420
Sounds like it came from above.

37:39.444 --> 37:41.022
I'll see if I can find a camera.

38:00.966 --> 38:02.460
Kensi.

38:14.855 --> 38:17.702
I found a couple of security
cameras on the building next door.

38:17.726 --> 38:20.106
I'm trying to access them now.

38:32.081 --> 38:33.171
Oh, my God.

38:33.195 --> 38:34.784
Kensi, what is it?

38:35.292 --> 38:37.059
I'm in the room
where they were holding Dom.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.830
This is where they shot the video.

38:39.546 --> 38:40.875
Callen, he never left L.A.

38:42.758 --> 38:46.127
I've got two camera feeds.
They're from the roof next door.

38:47.805 --> 38:49.299
Moe?

38:51.850 --> 38:54.139
Moe, wait a minute. Moe.

38:55.062 --> 38:57.387
I've got Dom. He's on the roof.

39:01.276 --> 39:02.747
- Dom's on the roof.
- Moe's here too.

39:02.771 --> 39:05.187
He's one floor above you, G.
I'm going to the roof.

39:12.204 --> 39:14.410
I got him. I got Dom.
He's alive. Dom.

39:16.166 --> 39:17.744
Come on.

39:27.094 --> 39:28.469
Get down. Get down.

39:30.139 --> 39:32.072
- Come on.
- Zooming in on camera B.

39:32.096 --> 39:35.682
- You've got a shooter on the roof.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

40:08.552 --> 40:09.750
Kalil's in the stairwell.

40:11.096 --> 40:13.089
- You okay?
- Yeah. I knew you would find me.

40:15.767 --> 40:16.823
Look out.

40:16.847 --> 40:18.181
Sam!

40:25.903 --> 40:28.334
No. Dom. Dom's been hit.

40:28.358 --> 40:31.080
Dom's hit. He's down. Dom's down.

40:31.104 --> 40:33.417
- Eric, medevac. Now.
- Right.

40:33.441 --> 40:35.528
Hang in there, buddy. Hang in there.

40:36.872 --> 40:38.699
I'm pinned down.

41:09.821 --> 41:13.107
- Kalil's down. Kensi.
- All clear.

41:13.742 --> 41:15.627
- Medevac is en route.
- Keep your eyes open.

41:15.651 --> 41:17.654
Come on. Hang in there, Dom.

41:23.460 --> 41:26.627
Oh, God.
I think they cut a femoral artery.

41:27.589 --> 41:29.392
Where's the damn medevac?

41:29.416 --> 41:31.335
Medevac's on the way.

41:38.308 --> 41:39.886
Come on.

41:46.525 --> 41:48.043
Sam.

41:48.067 --> 41:52.078
Sam, all you're doing is pumping out
what blood's left in his body.

41:52.102 --> 41:54.854
- Come on, Dom. Fight, man.
- Sam.

41:55.492 --> 41:56.713
He's gone, Sam.

41:56.737 --> 41:58.155
I ain't giving up on him, G.

41:59.204 --> 42:00.864
You didn't.

42:02.082 --> 42:03.327
None of us did.
