Previously on Dance Academy...

00:02.068 --> 00:06.024
Miss Webster. It's just me and you.
Prix de Fonteyn, baby.

00:06.044 --> 00:08.023
This is my chance
to be on the world stage.

00:08.044 --> 00:11.020
Showing them who I am's the only way
I'll be good enough to win.

00:14.008 --> 00:15.080
Hey, where's Sammy?
He's on right now.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.096
He was in an accident.
Sammy died on the way to hospital.

01:16.052 --> 01:17.096
They say before you die,

01:18.012 --> 01:19.084
your life flashes before your eyes.

01:22.024 --> 01:24.020
I hope so much that's true.

01:25.052 --> 01:29.084
That you get a photo album of every
moment, so you know you were here,

01:30.004 --> 01:32.000
that you were loved,
that you existed.

01:33.012 --> 01:37.020
You must need that second to prepare,
because you don't think...

01:37.040 --> 01:40.060
at least my friend didn't think
that he was going to die.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.064
So that one second
between life and death

01:46.080 --> 01:48.012
was all the time you got...

01:50.000 --> 01:51.044
to say 'goodbye'.

02:04.056 --> 02:06.000
What do we do now?

02:07.012 --> 02:08.076
Sorry?

02:08.092 --> 02:10.024
Miss Raine?

02:17.084 --> 02:19.088
We do have dressing rooms.

02:20.004 --> 02:23.072
Sorry. Samuel Lieberman. Lost.

02:25.004 --> 02:27.064
I remember you from the open rounds.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.080
Ah, probably my impressive jump?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.012
I remember not putting you through
to the final audition week

02:32.028 --> 02:34.008
and yet here you are.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.076
You can re-audition
for the academy next year.

02:37.088 --> 02:42.092
Yeah, see, no, I can't, because I
have an IQ of 135 and I go to school

02:43.012 --> 02:45.004
where they revere rugby
and they hate the arts.

02:45.024 --> 02:47.024
And look, I appreciate that's
not your problem but, you know,

02:47.044 --> 02:49.096
if you keep me in the classes,
I reckon I'd win you over.

02:56.008 --> 02:57.092
I will need a signature
from your parents.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.024
Thank you, really.
And Mr Lieberman,

03:00.040 --> 03:01.076
make sure you're worth it.

03:03.044 --> 03:06.092
Out of respect, the Prix de
Fonteyn committee have decided

03:07.012 --> 03:11.028
to postpone the remaining sections
of the competition for a week.

03:11.048 --> 03:14.080
And we're cancelling our production
of Peter Pan.

03:14.096 --> 03:16.028
He wasn't even in it.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.020
So what are we even doing here?

03:21.012 --> 03:23.072
We're still running classes
until the end of the semester

03:23.092 --> 03:26.032
but it's up to you whether
you feel like attending.

03:28.064 --> 03:32.012
I want you to know...
this is your home.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.036
A grief counsellor is on standby
and your teachers are all here.

04:29.036 --> 04:35.040
I'm not a funeral expert, but a few
prayers and some bad sandwiches...

04:35.060 --> 04:38.048
how can anyone expect that
to give you closure?

04:40.068 --> 04:43.008
I think today just felt formal.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.004
So then why don't we have our own?

04:49.020 --> 04:50.096
A proper Samuel Lieberman tribute.

04:51.012 --> 04:52.048
Shh!

04:53.064 --> 04:56.040
OK, so do you guys have any ideas
of what he would have wanted?

04:56.060 --> 05:00.012
No point dragging it on - it's all
anyone's done since it happened.

05:00.032 --> 05:03.000
What, you're bored
of the grieving talk, are you?

05:03.016 --> 05:04.048
It's morbid.

05:12.052 --> 05:15.028
Ethan,
you don't have to call every hour.

05:15.044 --> 05:17.044
I promise, I'm fine.

05:17.064 --> 05:21.064
I know it hurts, but resist
the urge to check up on me.

05:21.080 --> 05:25.096
Bye. Hello. Have we met?

05:27.072 --> 05:30.008
Whatcha got there?

05:30.028 --> 05:32.040
It's personal.

05:32.060 --> 05:36.076
Personal, huh? Oh, yeah, I know
parental fraud when I see it.

05:36.092 --> 05:38.072
My dad's not a fan of ballet, so...

05:40.056 --> 05:42.036
Oh, no, no, don't,
you're gonna do it wrong.

05:47.064 --> 05:49.008
Thanks.

05:50.020 --> 05:55.024
Hmm. So I'm gagging to bust out
of here and you're tunnelling in.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.044
But you're not though, are you?

05:57.064 --> 06:00.072
I mean, if you really didn't want to
be here then you'd be dancing badly.

06:00.092 --> 06:04.068
You're self-protecting.
Most likely fear of failure.

06:08.052 --> 06:11.040
OK, so, um, we'll need a eulogy.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.044
Just stuff like
how he saw the world,

06:13.060 --> 06:16.060
saw us, in his own unique way.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.012
Christian?
Sorry, what?

06:19.028 --> 06:20.060
Do you want to write it?

06:20.076 --> 06:24.004
I will. If that's OK with everyone.

06:26.032 --> 06:29.032
Um, OK,
so the venue is highly critical

06:29.052 --> 06:32.004
because it has to perfectly
embody who he is.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.036
Who he was.

06:44.012 --> 06:47.060
Abigail. How long have you been here?

06:49.036 --> 06:50.088
Just because you cancelled Peter Pan

06:51.008 --> 06:53.028
doesn't mean I have an interest
in sacrificing my technique.

06:55.060 --> 06:59.020
In that case, Sydney Dance is doing
a regional tour over Christmas.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.000
Rafael's asked to see some third
years who didn't get contracts,

07:02.016 --> 07:04.052
but I also thought maybe you...

07:04.068 --> 07:06.000
I'd love to audition.

07:07.008 --> 07:10.000
It is tomorrow, so if that's too...
So? Tomorrow's perfect.

07:16.048 --> 07:19.028
We want Sammy's laptop.
For his music library.

07:19.048 --> 07:21.000
No, that's not gonna happen,
alright?

07:21.020 --> 07:22.088
I'm packing up everything
for the Liebermans.

07:23.004 --> 07:24.048
Nothing else is leaving this room.

07:26.032 --> 07:29.004
Look, Ollie came in here before
and stole Sammy's cardigan.

07:29.024 --> 07:32.080
Oh, actions of a criminal.
And you're overruled.

07:38.012 --> 07:40.068
Do you want me to help you
pack everything into boxes?

07:40.088 --> 07:45.084
You have Prix practice.
Sammy would still want you to win.

07:46.004 --> 07:48.000
I may not know
what he'd want for his memorial,

07:48.016 --> 07:49.048
but that, I do know.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.084
Sorry, I'm...
I'm not in the right headspace.

08:06.004 --> 08:08.048
I know. But if you don't dance
between now and the finals,

08:08.068 --> 08:10.012
you won't...
I won't win?

08:12.028 --> 08:14.044
I don't care if I come last.

08:17.016 --> 08:20.088
I got... SO caught up in it,
this whole year...

08:21.008 --> 08:25.008
But it's not about the competition -
it's about being a dancer.

08:26.056 --> 08:29.060
Which means you dance
when you're in pain,

08:29.080 --> 08:31.076
you dance when
your heart's breaking...

08:31.096 --> 08:34.052
you put what you're feeling
into the performance.

08:35.063 --> 08:38.092
That's when you'll become the artist
I know you're capable of being.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.020
Ten leotards
should cover a six-week tour?

09:01.040 --> 09:02.080
I'm sure they have
a laundry service.

09:02.096 --> 09:04.028
You're packing already?

09:04.048 --> 09:06.008
You don't think I'm better
than the third years?

09:06.028 --> 09:08.072
Of course I do. It's just that
you've had a big knock, sweetheart.

09:08.092 --> 09:12.096
Maybe right now you should be...
Sobbing on the bathroom tiles?

09:13.016 --> 09:14.052
History dictates
you should be pleased

09:14.072 --> 09:16.068
I have my priorities back in order,
Mother.

09:25.068 --> 09:27.012
Rough night?

09:31.012 --> 09:33.020
Just the usual amount of humiliation.

09:36.032 --> 09:39.016
I've been dreaming about this place
since I was nine.

09:39.032 --> 09:42.080
Me too. Just picture it.

09:42.096 --> 09:44.028
Sleeping up there.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.024
No parents.

09:48.036 --> 09:51.080
We'll walk down these stairs
each morning. Go to classes.

09:51.096 --> 09:54.012
Yeah, it'd be pretty incredible.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.080
Getting to dance every day.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.096
And we'll take it for granted.

10:16.076 --> 10:19.008
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

10:22.068 --> 10:24.036
This is where...
This is where it happened.

10:24.056 --> 10:27.060
Yeah, I know.
Right? This is where we ran.

10:30.060 --> 10:33.008
I'm gonna need that cardigan back.

10:33.024 --> 10:34.056
He'd want me to have it.

10:36.088 --> 10:40.008
You want his cardigan.
You want his eulogy!

10:40.028 --> 10:42.028
You know,
I know what you said to him.

10:42.044 --> 10:46.012
What bit? That he was mediocre?

10:46.028 --> 10:48.060
Or that he was a sympathy vote?

10:48.080 --> 10:51.032
Because it's all running
through my head, 24/7.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.084
Give it back to me.
No.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.048
No, I wasn't asking! Alright?!

11:10.016 --> 11:13.024
Hello. Hi. Hi.

11:13.044 --> 11:17.092
Thanks for coming in.
I imagine it's a difficult time.

11:18.012 --> 11:21.048
No, no, I'm thrilled
to be auditioning, thank you.

11:21.068 --> 11:24.016
Um, I've prepared a solo for you.
Great.

11:53.096 --> 11:57.016
The guy must have been
clocking at least 70.

11:57.032 --> 11:58.064
Don't you reckon?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.088
I don't know. Sammy wouldn't
have walked without looking...

12:03.008 --> 12:06.068
I don't know, alright?
I wasn't there.

12:09.072 --> 12:11.016
He asked me to come.

12:13.072 --> 12:15.064
It was the Prix.

12:15.084 --> 12:18.024
You could have changed it,
could you?

12:18.044 --> 12:21.056
I could have pulled him
off the road faster.

12:21.076 --> 12:23.068
I could have called
an ambulance faster.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.044
He was always there for me.

12:30.012 --> 12:33.040
So why don't we start from
the beginning of the piece.

12:33.060 --> 12:37.024
Richard, with your arms.
And can you now hold his hands.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.072
Great.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.096
Hi.
I can do everything on my own,

12:44.016 --> 12:47.036
so just stand there
like you're assisting. OK?

12:52.064 --> 12:56.008
Will you stop looking at me
like that? Like what?

12:56.028 --> 12:59.040
Like you can't wait to get
your clammy hands on me.

14:03.068 --> 14:05.064
Is there a problem?

14:05.084 --> 14:11.032
Yes. Why would you partner me
with someone so good?

14:11.052 --> 14:15.000
I'm not prepared for that.
How could I be, learning

14:15.020 --> 14:17.072
the pas de deux basics
with a crap partner?

14:17.092 --> 14:21.080
Everyone wants to talk about
how amazing he was, but he wasn't.

14:21.096 --> 14:23.052
He was indescribably terrible...

14:23.072 --> 14:27.048
as a pas de deux partner
and as a boyfriend.

14:27.064 --> 14:30.028
And then he got his own boyfriend.

14:30.044 --> 14:32.028
And then he kissed me.

14:33.060 --> 14:35.020
And then he died.

14:37.008 --> 14:39.092
I mean,
what sort of a person does that?

14:44.052 --> 14:46.032
Sweetheart.
No, Mum, don't!

14:46.052 --> 14:49.008
Sweetheart, it's alright,
it's alright.

14:49.024 --> 14:52.000
I hate him. No, I hate him.

14:54.064 --> 14:58.052
The only thing that makes sense
is being with my friends right now.

15:00.068 --> 15:02.048
I know I'm letting you down.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.016
Tara...
I'm definitely letting him down.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.056
The last thing he said
was how proud he was of us.

15:13.048 --> 15:19.028
And I tried, but I can't put
what I'm feeling into my dancing.

15:21.096 --> 15:24.036
I'll pull you out of the prix.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.052
Thanks.

15:31.076 --> 15:34.088
None of it seems right.

15:35.004 --> 15:37.092
Maybe we can't make sense of it.

15:38.012 --> 15:41.076
The funeral didn't
and neither would a memorial...

15:41.092 --> 15:43.088
even if we knew what he wanted.

15:50.020 --> 15:51.064
He told me.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.008
The energy drink incident.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.088
He thought he was going
into cardiac arrest.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.004
It's pretty simple.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.084
Ready?

16:29.024 --> 16:30.068
Wait.

16:40.096 --> 16:42.040
I wasn't fine.

16:42.056 --> 16:43.088
I know.

17:00.084 --> 17:02.028
OK. Um...

17:04.031 --> 17:08.031
How do you sum up
Samuel Isadore Lieberman?

17:15.096 --> 17:19.051
Wow, what do you call that?
That's definitely going on my list.

17:21.048 --> 17:24.012
I've listed 50 things
I'm going to accomplish.

17:26.071 --> 17:29.072
Yeah.
Getting into the academy's No.2.

17:33.072 --> 17:37.000
I have to go
but we should hang out some time.

17:37.020 --> 17:39.084
You know,
wait for our letters together.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.036
Why would we do that?

17:42.056 --> 17:45.004
Well, I...
I don't know your situation,

17:45.024 --> 17:47.088
but at my school,
I don't have friends...

17:48.004 --> 17:50.084
I have acquaintances of convenience.

17:52.008 --> 17:54.012
But here, there's a common interest.

17:54.028 --> 17:55.060
So...

17:57.040 --> 18:00.088
you know, if we get in,
maybe we could be... mates.

18:01.004 --> 18:04.072
You and me? We'll never be mates.

18:07.088 --> 18:09.032
Fair enough.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.060
Well, ah, see ya.

18:34.084 --> 18:38.040
The best way to sum up Sammy
is in his own words.

18:38.060 --> 18:42.036
Um... this is a list
he wrote before first year.

18:46.008 --> 18:48.088
'No.50.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.024
Disprove the validity of jockstraps.'

18:54.012 --> 18:59.008
'49. Lobby to make ballet
an Olympic sport.'

18:59.024 --> 19:00.088
He asked for help with that.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.016
'21. Get a tattoo.

19:10.088 --> 19:14.064
20.
Dance on top of the Harbour Bridge.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.052
4. Stand up to my Dad.

19:22.092 --> 19:24.036
No.3.

19:27.080 --> 19:31.016
Fall in love
so my heart takes over from my head.

19:34.068 --> 19:39.060
No.2. Get into the
National Academy of Dance.

19:50.084 --> 19:52.028
No.1.

19:54.056 --> 19:58.044
Make a group of friends
I'll know for the rest of my life.

20:04.024 --> 20:10.084
Um... he didn't complete
all of these, obviously,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.096
but he definitely did the last one.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.052
And now it's time
for his favourite song.

20:32.096 --> 20:34.040
Wow, that's just...

20:34.060 --> 20:37.088
It definitely was his favourite.

20:38.008 --> 20:42.032
It was played... 368 times.

20:43.060 --> 20:45.072
OK, we're skipping
to the ninth favourite.

21:52.016 --> 21:54.092
Up... we're dancing.

22:23.060 --> 22:27.048
I haven't cried since it happened.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.044
Trust me. It'll happen.

22:36.016 --> 22:37.060
Come on.

22:38.064 --> 22:41.052
I don't know how to breathe
properly now my friend's gone.

22:45.016 --> 22:48.028
I want to kick and scream
and take it back.

22:56.064 --> 22:59.048
Give anything for this awful
emptiness to go away.

23:06.012 --> 23:09.092
And... more than anything...

23:10.008 --> 23:11.040
I don't want to say 'goodbye'.

23:15.016 --> 23:16.060
So I won't.

23:21.024 --> 23:23.084
I'll just say 'thank you'
that I knew him.

23:35.032 --> 23:38.096
There's no need to say 'goodbye'

23:39.012 --> 23:40.076
when you'll remember forever.

24:00.079 --> 24:32.768
