WEBVTT

00:04.746 --> 00:06.310
Hey, good morning.

00:06.335 --> 00:07.406
That's a pretty dress.

00:07.431 --> 00:08.587
Oh, thanks.

00:08.655 --> 00:11.275
Just heading out to go
check on my tomatoes.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.319
You mean to that dirt
patch around the corner?

00:13.344 --> 00:14.365
Looking like that?

00:14.390 --> 00:15.735
Who are you trying to impress?

00:15.760 --> 00:16.735
Is it that obvious?

00:16.760 --> 00:17.971
Only to me.

00:17.996 --> 00:19.347
Well, her name is Malkie.

00:19.372 --> 00:21.419
I met her at the community
garden last week.

00:21.444 --> 00:22.942
We talked for over an hour

00:22.967 --> 00:25.095
"about our love of 'Black Seaman"

00:25.646 --> 00:27.023
It's an heirloom tomato.

00:27.048 --> 00:27.914
Of course it is.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.311
Yeah, she's not my usual type.

00:29.336 --> 00:30.436
She's got this, like,

00:30.476 --> 00:32.883
all natural, kind of kinfolky vibe.

00:32.908 --> 00:33.972
Not a stitch of makeup.

00:33.997 --> 00:35.656
Can you tell that I'm wearing makeup?

00:35.681 --> 00:37.581
Uh, nope. You nailed
"trying not trying."

00:51.564 --> 00:52.727
Good morning, Bryce.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.665
What are you doing at my desk?

00:54.745 --> 00:58.653
Personal workspaces are
antiquated and constricting.

00:58.678 --> 01:00.711
At all my other companies, we hot desk.

01:00.736 --> 01:02.102
- Hot desk?
- Yeah.

01:02.127 --> 01:03.403
Everyone can sit wherever they want,

01:03.428 --> 01:04.370
whenever they want.

01:04.394 --> 01:05.485
It fosters equality,

01:05.510 --> 01:07.528
which in turn boosts productivity.

01:07.597 --> 01:09.212
I love it.

01:10.123 --> 01:12.588
Becky. Get out of Diana's office.

01:12.613 --> 01:13.596
But I'm hot desking.

01:13.621 --> 01:14.720
No, you're not. Get up.

01:14.745 --> 01:16.697
Get out. Now.

01:16.771 --> 01:18.972
- Does Charles know about this?
- Of course.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.478
Anyone bringing me on as an investor

01:20.503 --> 01:22.025
knows that I'm a disruptor.

01:22.050 --> 01:24.131
A world without hurricanes, Liza,

01:24.156 --> 01:25.879
is called a desert.

01:25.904 --> 01:27.309
Liza. Coffee.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.410
You know what, Diana?

01:28.435 --> 01:29.939
At all my other companies,

01:29.964 --> 01:31.732
everyone gets their own coffee.

01:31.757 --> 01:33.281
Well, at this company,

01:33.306 --> 01:34.650
Liza gets mine.

01:34.675 --> 01:36.049
Hierarchical structures

01:36.074 --> 01:37.955
are a real drag on productivity.

01:37.980 --> 01:39.806
French roast. Black.

01:39.831 --> 01:41.124
Don't get the coffee, Liza.

01:41.149 --> 01:42.732
Liza, I'm not kidding. March.

01:42.757 --> 01:43.957
- Stay, Liza.
- Go.

01:43.982 --> 01:45.336
- Sit.
- No... okay, you know what?

01:45.361 --> 01:47.131
I was going to get myself a coffee,

01:47.156 --> 01:49.094
and while I'm there, I'll just...

01:49.119 --> 01:50.625
I'll get two.

01:51.529 --> 01:52.943
Easy peasy.

01:59.977 --> 02:02.611
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:04.811 --> 02:06.177
He's abrasive.

02:06.202 --> 02:07.881
He looks like he just
came from the Shire.

02:07.906 --> 02:10.470
He is completely dismissive
of all of our traditions,

02:10.495 --> 02:11.881
and I don't care if
he's "on the spectrum."

02:11.906 --> 02:14.290
If he refers to me as
"that older lady in marketing"

02:14.315 --> 02:16.361
one more time,
I will smother him in his own hoodie.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.033
Bryce could help Empirical adapt

02:19.058 --> 02:21.667
in ways that we might
not think of ourselves.

02:21.692 --> 02:24.521
Just pretend he's from
a different culture.

02:24.604 --> 02:26.262
A culture you respect.

02:26.287 --> 02:27.404
Like the Japanese.

02:27.819 --> 02:30.191
- If that works for you.
- Or the Swiss.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.210
I mean, the Swiss are delightful.

02:32.488 --> 02:34.321
Yes, so they are.

02:34.346 --> 02:35.663
Is that you?

02:36.604 --> 02:39.631
Oh, I was, uh,
photographed at the opera benefit.

02:39.656 --> 02:42.109
So funny how those
things make the paper.

02:42.234 --> 02:43.702
You look great.

02:43.727 --> 02:45.280
And so does your...

02:45.305 --> 02:46.630
girlfriend?

02:46.991 --> 02:49.480
Let's just say it's new.

02:49.957 --> 02:51.834
Well, she is...

02:52.044 --> 02:53.444
really something.

02:53.469 --> 02:55.415
She is, isn't she?

03:06.479 --> 03:08.111
Loving your hat today.

03:08.136 --> 03:10.709
Malkie, hi!

03:10.734 --> 03:12.469
- Hi.
- Oh, I love yours too.

03:12.494 --> 03:14.761
It's actually from my
boutique on Bedford.

03:14.786 --> 03:16.552
You have a boutique on Bedford?

03:16.577 --> 03:18.711
How cool. What an amazing location.

03:18.736 --> 03:19.910
Yeah, I'm... I'm lucky.

03:19.935 --> 03:21.879
- I have a pretty loyal clientele.
- Mm.

03:21.904 --> 03:24.343
Hey, I took your gazpacho advice,

03:24.368 --> 03:25.769
"and I blended the 'Black Seama"

03:25.794 --> 03:27.544
with some 'Eva's Purple Balls.'

03:27.569 --> 03:28.764
- Delicious.
- Right?

03:28.789 --> 03:31.759
They're so, like, juicy.

03:31.784 --> 03:33.852
They blend well with almost anything.

03:33.877 --> 03:35.452
There's something on your arm.

03:35.477 --> 03:37.311
Oh.

03:37.336 --> 03:38.585
Got it.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.528
- Just a tomato leaf.
- Thanks.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.067
So, um, I'm actually
hosting a little event

03:43.092 --> 03:44.458
at the boutique tomorrow night

03:44.483 --> 03:46.322
to celebrate our new spring line.

03:46.347 --> 03:47.267
Would you want to come?

03:47.292 --> 03:48.582
I'd love to.

03:48.607 --> 03:50.635
I'm always in the market for a new hat.

03:51.589 --> 03:52.588
- Great.
- Yeah.

03:52.613 --> 03:53.591
Okay, I'll see you then.

03:53.616 --> 03:54.713
Yeah, bye.

03:54.738 --> 03:55.722
Bye.

04:02.523 --> 04:04.853
Why are the interns playing
"Grand Theft Auto"

04:04.878 --> 04:05.959
in the conference room?

04:05.984 --> 04:07.773
Another Bryce disruption.

04:07.798 --> 04:09.269
Want to complain about him over lunch?

04:09.294 --> 04:10.228
I can't.

04:10.253 --> 04:12.353
I have a sort of date.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.987
What? That's great.

04:14.012 --> 04:15.245
Lauren set me up on one of the new

04:15.270 --> 04:16.523
dating websites, HandleBar.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.810
Is that the one for girls

04:17.834 --> 04:19.353
who want to date guys with mustaches?

04:19.379 --> 04:21.228
No, that's Bristled Bros.

04:21.254 --> 04:24.164
HandleBar is for people
who can't handle a bar

04:24.189 --> 04:25.171
- on a first date.
- Oh.

04:25.196 --> 04:26.492
He's really cute, right?

04:26.517 --> 04:28.327
Wha... cute? He's gorgeous.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.884
I don't know if I've ever
seen eyes that green.

04:30.909 --> 04:32.042
I know.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.410
It's got to be FaceTuned, right?

04:33.435 --> 04:35.293
- Uh.
- I just want to be realistic.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.204
You know what they say.
"Hope for the best.

04:37.229 --> 04:38.595
Brace for a serial killer."

04:38.620 --> 04:41.010
Text me in case I need
an excuse to bail.

04:41.035 --> 04:42.020
You got it.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.441
So wait.

04:45.466 --> 04:46.726
You have your own imprint?

04:47.554 --> 04:48.590
That's incredible.

04:48.615 --> 04:50.377
- _
- No, I... I think what

04:50.402 --> 04:51.549
you do is incredible.

04:52.412 --> 04:53.463
I can't imagine what it would

04:53.488 --> 04:55.454
be like to produce segments for Vice.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.866
Have you been to Afghanistan?

04:56.891 --> 04:58.626
Yeah, uh...

04:58.651 --> 05:00.306
- A few times.
- Wow.

05:00.331 --> 05:02.727
That's... that's intense.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.243
You know what? I'm sorry.

05:05.268 --> 05:06.445
I'm putting this on silent.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.329
Me too. Airplane mode.

05:08.354 --> 05:10.847
Um, are you friends
checking in on you too?

05:10.872 --> 05:12.057
Yes.

05:12.082 --> 05:13.440
This is so embarrassing,

05:13.465 --> 05:14.450
but I kind of thought your picture

05:14.475 --> 05:15.985
was just too good to be true.

05:17.436 --> 05:19.010
I thought the same thing.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.183
Never would've imagined you'd
be even prettier in person.

05:22.605 --> 05:25.444
Look, I know that I'm supposed
to wait a couple of days

05:25.469 --> 05:27.246
before I ask you out again,

05:27.271 --> 05:29.370
but I'm over those kinds of games.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.506
I know I want to see you again.

05:32.145 --> 05:33.864
Is tomorrow night too soon?

05:33.889 --> 05:36.027
No. Not at all.

05:36.052 --> 05:36.731
I...

05:36.756 --> 05:38.346
I would love that.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.857
Liza.

05:46.963 --> 05:49.939
Apparently, Charles has a new somebody.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.202
I need you to find out everything

05:51.227 --> 05:52.416
about this Radha woman.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.148
Yeah, I met her at the benefit.

05:54.174 --> 05:56.022
She seems nice. I think she works

05:56.047 --> 05:57.442
for some kind of foundation.

05:57.467 --> 05:59.870
That's it? I need more.
Her Facebook is set to private.

05:59.895 --> 06:01.070
Oh, they're never really private.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.651
I think there's something
called Stalkbook.

06:02.676 --> 06:03.452
I'll check it out.

06:03.478 --> 06:04.824
Stalkbook? Really?

06:04.849 --> 06:06.309
Is there no end to the madness?

06:06.334 --> 06:08.531
Last week,
someone suggested I get Cormac McCarthy

06:08.555 --> 06:10.378
on Snapchat. The man is 83.

06:10.465 --> 06:11.864
I know it's overwhelming,

06:11.889 --> 06:14.490
but it's not as hard
to adapt as it seems.

06:14.515 --> 06:16.778
Oh, not to you.
You've been texting since birth.

06:16.804 --> 06:18.389
Uh, right.

06:18.642 --> 06:21.842
But even so, I mean,
it's less about learning new things

06:21.866 --> 06:24.646
and more about letting go of old things.

06:24.671 --> 06:25.459
What do you mean?

06:25.484 --> 06:26.816
Uh, take voicemails,

06:26.841 --> 06:27.983
for instance.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.200
Maybe stop leaving those.

06:29.225 --> 06:30.144
They're now officially

06:30.169 --> 06:31.202
considered annoying.

06:31.227 --> 06:32.831
Interesting. What else?

06:32.856 --> 06:34.548
Email is on its way out.

06:34.573 --> 06:36.052
Texting is best,

06:36.077 --> 06:37.582
the less punctuation the better.

06:37.607 --> 06:38.773
Horrifying. Go on.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.254
Oh, and don't say "dot com" anymore.

06:40.279 --> 06:40.990
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

06:41.015 --> 06:42.436
And maybe think about

06:42.461 --> 06:43.323
softening your look.

06:43.348 --> 06:44.414
I mean, just a little.

06:44.439 --> 06:45.542
Like, be...

06:45.567 --> 06:46.632
comfortable.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.540
I am comfortable.

06:54.933 --> 06:56.666
- Hey.
- Thanks.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.659
He picked up the tab

07:00.684 --> 07:02.897
and paid for my Uber back to the office.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.301
If this is dating, dating is easy.

07:05.326 --> 07:07.471
Whoa. He is, like, Hemsworth hot.

07:07.496 --> 07:08.536
Wait, is he a Hemsworth?

07:08.561 --> 07:11.032
Wait, wait. Are those color contacts?

07:11.057 --> 07:12.002
- Oh, my God.
- No.

07:12.027 --> 07:13.990
And in person, they twinkle.

07:14.015 --> 07:17.168
Oh, that explains the
lens flare on the photo.

07:17.193 --> 07:18.023
What is the catch?

07:18.048 --> 07:19.027
Is he a himbo?

07:19.051 --> 07:20.722
No, he went to Columbia.

07:20.747 --> 07:21.527
Theater major?

07:21.552 --> 07:23.585
Engineering plus dual minors

07:23.610 --> 07:25.141
in film and Russian literature.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.205
- Strong combo.
- Russian literature.

07:26.230 --> 07:27.067
So he's boring.

07:27.092 --> 07:28.396
He's been to North Korea.

07:28.421 --> 07:29.259
Self-centered?

07:29.284 --> 07:30.382
A mansplainer?

07:30.407 --> 07:32.533
Bad dresser? Cargo pants?

07:32.558 --> 07:34.285
No. Totally on fleek.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.809
Okay, no. Two things.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.442
Never say "on fleek" again, all right?

07:37.467 --> 07:38.634
That is beyond over.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.994
More importantly,
you might have a big problem here.

07:41.019 --> 07:42.965
He... he sounds like a
diamond in the rough, okay?

07:42.990 --> 07:44.167
And you cannot squander
a diamond in the rough,

07:44.193 --> 07:45.654
not in these dark dating times.

07:45.678 --> 07:47.214
All right, you put
him on the back burner

07:47.239 --> 07:48.846
and find yourself a bad pancake first.

07:48.871 --> 07:50.408
What's a bad pancake?

07:50.433 --> 07:53.595
It's this theory that the
first guy that you date

07:53.620 --> 07:55.095
after a serious relationship

07:55.120 --> 07:56.938
is doomed to be the bad pancake.

07:56.963 --> 07:59.917
Yeah, because the first
pancake always gets burned.

07:59.942 --> 08:02.342
The bad pancake never turns
out to be a real relationship.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.381
- It's predestined to fail.
- That's not true.

08:04.406 --> 08:07.372
I mean, technically,
I'm Liza's bad pancake.

08:07.397 --> 08:09.012
- I'm still here.
- Yeah, and you two

08:09.036 --> 08:10.586
are the picture of a
stable relationship.

08:10.611 --> 08:13.137
Listen, guys,
Max is throwing a party tomorrow night

08:13.162 --> 08:15.192
with some of the other intern
friends from his hospital.

08:15.217 --> 08:17.282
You guys should all come,
and bring Lucas, all right?

08:17.307 --> 08:18.685
I want to check him out for myself.

08:18.710 --> 08:20.463
Maybe a quick hello.

08:20.487 --> 08:21.764
Okay, we'll stop by.

08:22.249 --> 08:23.952
Uh, is Max okay?

08:23.977 --> 08:25.620
Oh, yeah, no, no, no. He's fine.

08:25.645 --> 08:27.488
Yeah, he's just power napping.

08:27.513 --> 08:28.621
His shift started at 4:00 a.m.,

08:28.646 --> 08:30.595
and then he had to stay
late to reattach a thumb.

08:30.620 --> 08:32.101
Wait, do you guys want
to see a pic of the thumb

08:32.126 --> 08:33.283
before they reattach it? No.

08:33.308 --> 08:34.269
- Yes, yes!
- Yes.

08:45.999 --> 08:47.474
Hello.

08:47.996 --> 08:49.918
Something's different about you.

08:50.288 --> 08:52.789
Can't quite put my finger on it.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.852
Oh, you can put your finger on it.

08:55.877 --> 08:58.040
Liza.

09:03.429 --> 09:04.350
Well?

09:04.375 --> 09:06.652
I love the jeans. You look...

09:06.677 --> 09:07.820
Not the jeans.

09:07.845 --> 09:09.399
Radha. Details.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.776
Oh, she's the director

09:11.801 --> 09:13.930
of the Rockefeller Repositioning Fund.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.454
So she's a do-gooder?

09:15.479 --> 09:16.514
On a vast scale.

09:16.539 --> 09:17.791
She speaks four languages,

09:17.816 --> 09:20.026
law and environmental
studies degrees from Yale,

09:20.051 --> 09:22.108
plus she has a line of
cruelty-free handbags.

09:22.133 --> 09:23.606
Where do the profits go?

09:23.698 --> 09:26.607
Back to the worker-owned
factory in Pakistan.

09:27.236 --> 09:28.177
Kill me.

09:28.202 --> 09:29.638
But you know what?

09:30.059 --> 09:31.941
I bet she's just the bad pancake.

09:31.966 --> 09:32.852
The what?

09:32.877 --> 09:34.050
It's this theory that

09:34.075 --> 09:35.181
the first person you date

09:35.206 --> 09:36.372
after a serious relationship

09:36.397 --> 09:38.169
is doomed to be the bad pancake

09:38.194 --> 09:40.465
- because the first pancake...
- Always gets burned!

09:40.490 --> 09:41.197
Yes, definitely.

09:41.222 --> 09:42.682
She is definitely the bad pancake.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.299
Yeah, so...

09:46.563 --> 09:48.189
So the jeans.

09:49.029 --> 09:50.218
Too much?

09:50.243 --> 09:51.576
You look great.

09:51.694 --> 09:53.193
Totally on fleek.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.484
What? Fleek? I'm...

09:54.509 --> 09:55.975
I'm not familiar with that phrase.

09:56.000 --> 09:56.908
Should I be?

09:56.933 --> 09:58.138
Actually, don't bother.

09:58.163 --> 10:00.035
- I think it's already over.
- Mm.

10:01.065 --> 10:02.898
So far, the "P is for Pigeon" reviews

10:03.076 --> 10:04.742
are lining up nicely, and we...

10:04.767 --> 10:07.768
I've been invited to Summit,
and I have to prepare a speech.

10:07.793 --> 10:08.996
We're in a meeting, Bryce.

10:09.022 --> 10:11.356
Right,
I should have prefaced with "excuse me."

10:11.380 --> 10:13.049
- So the speech needs...
- What is Summit?

10:13.074 --> 10:15.333
It's an elite tech conference.

10:15.358 --> 10:16.979
The most elite in the world.

10:17.005 --> 10:18.124
They want to hear my ideas

10:18.148 --> 10:19.991
for reinventing an old media company.

10:20.016 --> 10:22.950
By "old media," you mean books?

10:22.975 --> 10:24.233
Yes. Metadata-wise,

10:24.258 --> 10:25.646
interactive digital books

10:25.671 --> 10:27.429
are clearly where the
industry is heading.

10:27.454 --> 10:29.185
When people read "The Lion,
the Witch, and the Wardrobe,"

10:29.210 --> 10:30.766
they want to actually enter Narnia,

10:30.791 --> 10:32.350
not just read about it.

10:32.413 --> 10:35.214
Isn't that what your imagination is for?

10:35.239 --> 10:37.635
I always hated the end of
"The Great Gatsby," you know?

10:37.660 --> 10:39.243
We could issue an interactive version

10:39.268 --> 10:41.025
where readers decide that
Gatsby never gets shot

10:41.050 --> 10:41.949
in that pool.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.737
Spoiler alert.

10:43.762 --> 10:44.761
Why are you even here?

10:44.786 --> 10:46.414
Meetings are open to everyone now.

10:46.439 --> 10:50.406
Okay, so you and your
esteemed protégé over there

10:50.431 --> 10:51.698
think it would be a good idea

10:51.723 --> 10:55.410
to rewrite one of the most
iconic American classics

10:55.435 --> 10:56.495
of all time?

10:56.520 --> 10:57.535
Why not?

10:57.560 --> 10:58.843
We could even deconstruct

10:58.868 --> 11:00.353
the entire e-book model, you know?

11:00.378 --> 11:01.838
Make all of Empirical just an app.

11:01.863 --> 11:04.306
Wow, that's really, uh, depressing.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.497
It's also not going to happen,

11:05.522 --> 11:06.721
but I am doing my best

11:06.746 --> 11:09.014
to appreciate your enthusiasm, Bryce.

11:09.039 --> 11:11.362
If I may resume.

11:12.115 --> 11:14.277
"P is for Pigeon" was
released today, and...

11:14.302 --> 11:15.668
It won't sell.

11:15.693 --> 11:18.261
Metrics indicate people
actively dislike pigeons.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.543
It is not literally about pigeons.

11:20.568 --> 11:23.753
It is a metaphor

11:24.076 --> 11:26.549
based on the life of Martha,

11:26.574 --> 11:29.530
the world's last known
living passenger pigeon,

11:29.554 --> 11:31.787
and you would know that,

11:31.813 --> 11:33.712
if you had ever bothered

11:33.737 --> 11:35.104
to read it!

11:36.589 --> 11:37.988
Excuse me.

11:41.524 --> 11:43.679
I offended them. Why?

11:43.704 --> 11:45.327
Uh, you just said you wanted to reduce

11:45.352 --> 11:47.352
a century of literary distinction

11:47.377 --> 11:48.599
down to an app.

11:48.670 --> 11:50.604
And that's offensive, how?

11:55.910 --> 11:57.176
Do you think actual books

11:57.201 --> 11:58.988
could really become just a novelty?

11:59.013 --> 12:00.047
Truth?

12:00.072 --> 12:01.645
Yeah, probably.

12:01.867 --> 12:02.944
Look at newspapers.

12:02.969 --> 12:04.603
Yeah, and quaaludes.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.874
No, no, not for you. Stop.

12:06.899 --> 12:09.099
It's for Maggie's new
garden crush, Malkie.

12:09.124 --> 12:12.425
I'm telling you, she
and I have this amazing

12:12.450 --> 12:14.543
unspoken erotic spark.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.707
She invited me to this party,

12:15.732 --> 12:17.832
and I'm bringing my famous Bolognese.

12:17.857 --> 12:19.321
It's an aphrodisiac.

12:19.346 --> 12:21.342
The secret is the sausage.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.600
I thought you guys avoided sausage.

12:27.195 --> 12:29.122
- _
- Oh, we got to go.

12:29.147 --> 12:31.095
We have a doctor's appointment.

12:31.121 --> 12:32.848
Doctor's appointment.

12:32.873 --> 12:34.411
- Good luck.
- Bye. I'll save you some.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.401
Mm.

12:41.664 --> 12:43.013
Ah, ah! There you are.

12:43.038 --> 12:44.403
Where have you been?

12:44.428 --> 12:45.884
The nitrous tank is already kicked.

12:45.909 --> 12:47.956
Hey, guys. Want a shot?

12:50.137 --> 12:51.674
- Oh.
- Nice.

12:51.699 --> 12:53.606
Hey, this is Liza. This is Josh.

12:53.631 --> 12:54.854
Hi, I'm Lucas.

12:54.878 --> 12:56.208
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.255
So, uh...

12:58.281 --> 13:00.859
- everyone here is a doctor?
- Or sleeping with one.

13:00.884 --> 13:02.084
Looks like somebody needs a refill.

13:02.109 --> 13:03.576
Yeah, we should go put
these beers in the fridge.

13:03.601 --> 13:04.345
Okay.

13:04.370 --> 13:05.211
He's so cute.

13:05.236 --> 13:06.215
I know, right?

13:06.240 --> 13:08.461
Okay, okay, that beautiful man

13:08.486 --> 13:09.847
is soul mate material.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.158
Dude, you cannot date him right now.

13:11.183 --> 13:12.364
Your mixed-up widow brain

13:12.389 --> 13:14.354
is going to eff it the eff up.

13:14.379 --> 13:15.208
Oh, my God.

13:15.233 --> 13:16.627
I will, won't I? Damn it.

13:16.652 --> 13:18.852
Okay, put that quality
batter back in the fridge

13:18.877 --> 13:20.438
and find a bad pancake.

13:20.463 --> 13:22.299
You know what I'm tired of?

13:22.324 --> 13:24.642
All these... these
wannabe MILFs blaming us

13:24.667 --> 13:26.196
for their inability to get preggo.

13:26.221 --> 13:27.588
Like every day.

13:27.613 --> 13:28.654
Wannabe MILFs?

13:28.679 --> 13:30.450
Yeah, yeah, these hot older women

13:30.475 --> 13:32.730
who want to be moms but have no idea

13:32.755 --> 13:34.381
their ovaries are basically toast.

13:34.406 --> 13:36.586
I tell all my patients
over 35 to wake up

13:36.612 --> 13:38.620
and smell the biological clock.

13:38.774 --> 13:39.956
Want a hit?

13:39.981 --> 13:41.556
Oh, yeah.

13:42.092 --> 13:43.425
Hey.

13:43.450 --> 13:44.683
There you are.

13:44.718 --> 13:46.986
I was scared you were hiding from me.

13:47.838 --> 13:51.191
Were you hiding from me? What is it?

13:51.216 --> 13:52.949
If it's something I did or said...

13:52.974 --> 13:55.743
No, oh... oh, my God, you...
you didn't do anything.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.157
You're... great.

13:58.182 --> 14:01.916
It's just that I am finally
getting back on my feet

14:01.940 --> 14:04.111
after an intense relationship

14:04.136 --> 14:06.334
that ended in an even more intense way.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.719
We've all had bad
endings to relationships.

14:08.744 --> 14:10.152
Trust me.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.870
Not like mine.

14:11.895 --> 14:13.089
I know that we just met,

14:13.114 --> 14:16.390
but I think that we
could have something,

14:16.415 --> 14:21.142
and my friend has this bad
pancake theory where...

14:21.167 --> 14:22.965
I know the bad pancake theory.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.434
I have sisters.

14:24.459 --> 14:25.976
Wait a second.

14:27.412 --> 14:29.223
I think I understand.

14:29.248 --> 14:32.889
You don't want me to be the bad pancake.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.309
Is that it?

14:34.334 --> 14:36.467
I get it. You need some time.

14:36.492 --> 14:39.162
- I can give you that.
- Really?

14:39.187 --> 14:41.218
You don't meet girls worth
waiting for every day,

14:41.243 --> 14:43.291
so when you do,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.261
you wait.

14:45.787 --> 14:48.131
So what you're saying is,

14:48.156 --> 14:51.405
when a woman, like, turns,
I don't know, say, 40,

14:51.430 --> 14:53.802
the chances of her getting pregnant are,
like, what?

14:53.827 --> 14:54.456
Cut in half?

14:54.481 --> 14:55.904
More than half, brah.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.252
Once you hit 35,

14:57.277 --> 14:59.015
- shit starts to break down.
- Really?

14:59.040 --> 15:02.041
That's why I'm shooting
mine out in my 20s!

15:02.066 --> 15:04.439
Uh, yeah. Getting pregnant in your 20s

15:04.464 --> 15:06.104
is like catching a cold.

15:06.129 --> 15:08.694
Wow. Hmm.

15:26.776 --> 15:28.038
Maggie.

15:28.063 --> 15:29.173
- You made it.
- Hi.

15:29.198 --> 15:30.775
- Come in.
- Wow.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.620
Um, it... it's not what I expected.

15:33.645 --> 15:35.065
Ooh, uh...

15:35.090 --> 15:37.090
buying this. Love it.

15:37.148 --> 15:39.373
Yeah, my store specializes

15:39.398 --> 15:42.098
in stylish clothing
for the modest woman.

15:42.123 --> 15:43.818
Mostly Orthodox Jewish women.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.130
Right.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.273
Yeah, I mean, of course.

15:47.298 --> 15:50.040
Oh, this sauce looks amazing.

15:50.065 --> 15:50.999
What's in it?

15:51.023 --> 15:53.526
Oh, it's, um... It's a sausa...

15:53.552 --> 15:56.755
You know, it's a bad batch.

16:01.536 --> 16:02.843
Are you okay?

16:02.868 --> 16:05.657
Mm, fine. Yeah, great.

16:06.723 --> 16:08.147
I have a confession to make.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.038
Um, I must be off my game or something,

16:10.063 --> 16:12.692
because I kind of missed a few things.

16:12.899 --> 16:14.375
I thought you were gay,

16:14.400 --> 16:16.075
not Orthodox.

16:16.542 --> 16:19.574
Well, why can't I be both?

16:19.742 --> 16:21.909
I'm what you might call...

16:21.934 --> 16:23.415
an Orthodyke.

16:29.185 --> 16:30.903
Is that medical grade?

16:30.928 --> 16:32.783
Chemo wing at the hospital.

16:33.463 --> 16:34.540
Oh, my God. Amazing.

16:34.565 --> 16:35.553
What?

16:35.578 --> 16:37.432
Uh, "P is for Pigeon" was just nominated

16:37.457 --> 16:38.645
for the Man Booker Prize.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.775
- Is that good?
- Yes.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.996
It's one of the most prestigious
awards in publishing.

16:43.021 --> 16:44.231
Amazing, babe. Congrats.

16:44.256 --> 16:46.023
Thank you. It's all Diana's doing.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.515
I have to call her.
I'll be right back, okay?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.473
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:48.498 --> 16:50.133
Oh, my God.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.272
It's late. What did you do?

16:57.298 --> 16:58.654
Are you sitting down?

16:58.679 --> 17:00.271
Liza, please.

17:00.296 --> 17:02.440
Okay, well...

17:02.850 --> 17:04.450
It was what?

17:04.555 --> 17:06.277
The... the Booker?

17:06.301 --> 17:07.590
Are you sure?

17:07.616 --> 17:09.892
Uh, well, how did you find out?

17:10.465 --> 17:13.085
No, no, I don't have Google Alerts.

17:13.109 --> 17:15.550
Perhaps my assistant should set it up.

17:15.938 --> 17:17.940
Okay, well, um...

17:18.002 --> 17:20.945
thank you for informing me.

17:26.731 --> 17:28.843
Thank you for being so cool.

17:28.868 --> 17:30.301
I'll be thinking about you

17:30.326 --> 17:32.138
the entire tram ride home.

17:32.198 --> 17:33.513
Tram?

17:33.538 --> 17:36.704
Yeah, uh, I live on Roosevelt Island.

17:36.730 --> 17:39.096
You live on Roosevelt Island?

17:39.121 --> 17:41.173
Like, you live there. Full-time.

17:41.198 --> 17:43.371
Uh, yeah.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.285
I actually... I...

17:44.311 --> 17:45.982
I bought my place there.

17:46.007 --> 17:48.233
- I got a great deal on it.
- Bought.

17:48.258 --> 17:49.846
Did you just say you
live on Roosevelt Island?

17:49.871 --> 17:51.437
Like... like, you...
You live there, live there?

17:51.462 --> 17:52.721
Wasn't it a leper colony?

17:52.745 --> 17:54.012
Is it true there's a curfew?

17:54.037 --> 17:55.599
Do Ubers even go there?

17:55.625 --> 17:57.521
Roosevelt Island. Oh,
my God, I was wrong.

17:57.546 --> 17:59.021
He... he is your bad pancake.

17:59.046 --> 18:00.921
In fact, he is the perfect bad pancake.

18:00.946 --> 18:02.642
Okay, don't you think
that we could work some...

18:02.667 --> 18:03.967
Girl, are you fully registering?

18:03.992 --> 18:05.462
He lives on Roosevelt Island!

18:05.487 --> 18:06.666
Oh, my God.

18:06.692 --> 18:07.754
You're right.

18:07.779 --> 18:09.264
That's my bad pancake.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.654
Tram slam him.

18:10.679 --> 18:12.365
Then you come straight home.

18:26.536 --> 18:28.396
Well, that was unexpected.

18:29.645 --> 18:32.094
You are all over the place,

18:32.119 --> 18:33.205
and I like it.

18:39.906 --> 18:42.326
Lucas, I'm sorry, but...

18:42.523 --> 18:44.474
I'm not getting off the tram.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.836
What? Why?

18:46.861 --> 18:47.796
Wait.

18:47.821 --> 18:50.402
Is this because I live
on Roosevelt Island?

18:50.426 --> 18:52.433
You think I'm the bad pancake.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.676
No. Maybe.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.248
Oh, my God. Okay, yes.

18:56.274 --> 18:57.173
I'm so sorry.

18:57.198 --> 18:58.664
It's really not that bad here.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.522
It's like the Ile
Saint-Louis of Manhattan.

19:00.547 --> 19:02.314
There's even talk about
getting a Whole Foods.

19:02.339 --> 19:04.005
I got a great Mexican place by me

19:04.030 --> 19:05.283
that also serves sushi.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.923
Hey, do you want a Xanax?

19:17.948 --> 19:19.465
What? No.

19:19.490 --> 19:20.773
Where did you get a Xanax?

19:20.798 --> 19:22.342
Some drunk neurologist

19:22.367 --> 19:23.993
gave me some party
favors on the way out.

19:24.977 --> 19:27.499
I had no idea doctors were so chill.

19:27.524 --> 19:28.892
Yeah.

19:29.890 --> 19:31.634
Uh, so what was, um...

19:31.659 --> 19:33.651
What was with all the
pregnancy questions?

19:33.676 --> 19:34.860
What?

19:34.885 --> 19:36.430
I don't know, babe.

19:36.455 --> 19:38.231
I'm just curious, I guess.

19:39.645 --> 19:42.896
Hey, why did you decide

19:42.921 --> 19:44.348
to have Caitlin so young?

19:44.373 --> 19:46.480
I didn't exactly decide.

19:46.505 --> 19:49.167
I guess you could say I caught a cold.

19:50.012 --> 19:52.632
And it was the most wonderful
thing that ever happened to me.

19:54.802 --> 19:57.482
You ever think you'd catch a cold again?

19:58.639 --> 20:00.562
I don't think so.

20:02.404 --> 20:04.314
I'm still getting over the first one.

20:15.004 --> 20:16.203
Oh, Bryce.

20:16.228 --> 20:20.275
I have something you can
talk about at your Summit.

20:21.259 --> 20:22.925
"P is for Pigeon"... You know,

20:22.950 --> 20:24.494
the book you said no one you read...

20:24.519 --> 20:27.338
Has been longlisted for
the Man Booker Prize.

20:28.342 --> 20:30.610
The Booker? Oh, my God, Diana.

20:30.635 --> 20:32.356
- That's fantastic.
- Isn't it?

20:32.381 --> 20:33.886
No one at Summit will care about that.

20:33.911 --> 20:36.956
People at Summit might not care,
but I sure do.

20:37.271 --> 20:38.962
Congratulations.

20:39.420 --> 20:40.796
Thank you.

20:40.821 --> 20:42.837
Everybody, congratulations.

20:42.862 --> 20:46.615
Bryce, I've been thinking
about your ideas for Empirical,

20:46.640 --> 20:47.872
and I think you're wrong.

20:47.906 --> 20:50.093
I doubt that. I'm rarely wrong.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.451
Wait, wrong about what?

20:51.476 --> 20:53.734
The future of this company, of books.

20:53.759 --> 20:57.093
I believe great literature will survive,

20:57.118 --> 20:59.418
because we need great stories.

20:59.443 --> 21:02.064
I can't help it. I'm
a hopeless romantic.

21:02.089 --> 21:03.615
Like Don Quixote.

21:03.641 --> 21:05.681
Yeah, hopefully less delusional.

21:05.705 --> 21:07.271
You are delusional if you can't see

21:07.296 --> 21:10.384
that it's time to either evolve or die

21:10.409 --> 21:12.233
like an extinct pigeon.

21:12.258 --> 21:14.605
My disruptions are
gonna save your company.

21:15.062 --> 21:18.488
Rewriting Fitzgerald
is not a disruption.

21:18.655 --> 21:20.511
It's a desecration.

21:20.933 --> 21:22.735
Well, I'm not gonna
invest in your company

21:22.760 --> 21:24.461
if you aren't gonna listen to my ideas.

21:24.486 --> 21:25.838
Well, then...

21:26.477 --> 21:29.157
maybe you shouldn't
invest in our company.

21:30.735 --> 21:32.188
Then congratulations

21:32.213 --> 21:34.190
on rendering your company nugatory.

21:34.431 --> 21:36.273
I'll have my lawyers contact yours.

21:44.215 --> 21:46.360
Hey, I just want you to know

21:46.385 --> 21:48.335
that what you just did back there

21:48.360 --> 21:51.694
is what makes Empirical extraordinary.

21:51.823 --> 21:54.739
It's why I'm so happy
to be working here.

21:54.764 --> 21:55.943
Thank you.

21:56.178 --> 21:58.270
I appreciate that.

21:59.476 --> 22:02.147
I just hope I didn't talk myself
onto the brink of bankruptcy.

22:02.172 --> 22:05.175
Well, me too, obviously, but...

22:05.429 --> 22:07.485
you followed your heart,

22:07.701 --> 22:09.602
and that's what's important.

22:09.775 --> 22:12.414
Yeah, well, sometimes I can be impulsive

22:12.439 --> 22:14.576
when I'm following my heart.
