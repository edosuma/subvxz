WEBVTT

00:03.810 --> 00:05.351
- Yo!

00:05.419 --> 00:07.867
The captain wishes
to address the troops.

00:07.935 --> 00:09.876
Attention.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.906
- Someone get gil a drink.

00:11.974 --> 00:13.363
- Why?

00:13.430 --> 00:14.587
Is your dad buying?

00:14.655 --> 00:16.699
- Ooh.
- That's all right.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.487
I got my job
the old-fashioned way--

00:19.554 --> 00:20.621
Nepotism.

00:20.690 --> 00:21.857
[laughter]
- I'll drink to that.

00:21.925 --> 00:24.492
- The past few years
have been tough.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.961
People have put in
long hours...

00:27.029 --> 00:29.796
Working close with me...

00:29.864 --> 00:33.166
Like dave.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.569
We go way back
to tougher times than these.

00:35.637 --> 00:39.175
- That's right, captain.

00:39.243 --> 00:41.977
- We celebrate tonight

00:42.045 --> 00:43.981
Because
willoughby bank and trust

00:44.049 --> 00:47.720
Has had the first good year
in a long, long time.

00:47.788 --> 00:49.590
[applause]
- yeah!

00:49.657 --> 00:51.660
- Right.
- It's about time, huh?

00:51.728 --> 00:54.264
- To the future.
- To the future.

00:54.332 --> 00:56.969
All:
To the future.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.612
- Great.
See you tomorrow.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.515
Well done tonight.

01:08.055 --> 01:08.988
- David.

01:09.056 --> 01:11.091
- Nathan, hey.

01:11.159 --> 01:12.927
Great speech...

01:12.995 --> 01:16.532
And not just 'cause you said
nice things about me.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.736
- So he found you
at t the hotel?

01:19.804 --> 01:21.872
- Yeah.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.473
- Thanks.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.108
Everyone needs someone
they can trust.

01:27.176 --> 01:31.244
And that will work
both ways, old buddy.

01:38.415 --> 01:40.116
- You paid for the dinner.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.218
- What?
No.

01:42.286 --> 01:44.254
Yes, but don't worry
about it.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.422
- David,
we can't afford this.

01:46.490 --> 01:48.457
- Think how many tabs
nathan's picked up.

01:48.525 --> 01:51.126
- Well, with what he makes,
he should.

01:52.795 --> 01:55.197
- Cynthia...

01:55.264 --> 01:57.566
I'm showing I belong.

01:57.634 --> 02:00.801
- I care about us,
not belonging with them.

02:00.869 --> 02:03.904
- Hey,
think what we have now

02:03.972 --> 02:06.406
Versus before.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.407
Life's good, right?

02:13.314 --> 02:15.414
- What matters
is how it's malted.

02:15.482 --> 02:17.617
- I thought scotch and whiskey
were the same thing.

02:17.684 --> 02:19.886
- Only when you're hugging
the toilet at 4:00 a.M.

02:19.954 --> 02:21.888
[both laugh]
- you're awful.

02:21.956 --> 02:23.624
- Made you laugh.

02:23.691 --> 02:25.326
- I see we're hitting it off.

02:25.393 --> 02:27.294
- We are, thanks to you.

02:27.362 --> 02:30.297
- I need a word with amber--
girl talk.

02:30.365 --> 02:33.667
- I'll hit the sandbox.

02:35.469 --> 02:36.970
- When he comes back,
gia takes him.

02:37.038 --> 02:37.971
You're gone.

02:38.039 --> 02:39.306
- What?

02:39.374 --> 02:40.607
- Someone from a tabloid
called me.

02:40.675 --> 02:41.941
You sell information
on clients.

02:42.009 --> 02:44.409
It's over.
Now go.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.553 --> 02:56.821
- And you believe
that lying bitch over me?

02:56.889 --> 02:59.157
- Because you want
to ruin things for me.

02:59.224 --> 03:01.059
- Yeah, ruin your career
as a hooker.

03:01.126 --> 03:03.261
It's not exactly
a point of pride with me.

03:03.329 --> 03:05.363
- I'm not a hooker.

03:05.431 --> 03:07.098
- Yeah.
[scoffs]

03:07.166 --> 03:08.767
Tell yourself you're a model

03:08.834 --> 03:10.502
Next time
you're under a sweaty body.

03:10.570 --> 03:11.702
[bottle shatters]
- get out!

03:11.770 --> 03:12.903
- No problem.

03:12.970 --> 03:15.470
- You ruin everything, kevin!

03:15.538 --> 03:17.671
- Slut.

03:17.738 --> 03:20.305
I'm still going through
with it.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.870
[car engine turning]

03:25.938 --> 03:27.972
- David?

03:44.412 --> 03:46.576
- He's calling
from the truck.

03:46.644 --> 03:49.445
That's getting warm.

03:49.513 --> 03:52.779
- Tell me
when you hit something.

03:52.846 --> 03:54.879
- Shut it down.

03:54.947 --> 03:56.012
Shut it down!

03:56.080 --> 03:58.514
Shut it down!
- Shut it down!

04:03.915 --> 04:06.515
<b>Sub by Adriano_CSI</b>

04:55.865 --> 04:57.399
- Oh, joy.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.034
- Come on,
the chance to sift trash

04:59.102 --> 05:00.636
After doughnuts and coffee?

05:00.704 --> 05:02.473
- Garbage crew
found the remains.

05:02.540 --> 05:05.983
No hands, no feet, no head,
but it's a male.

05:06.051 --> 05:07.651
- So it's a cul-de-sac.

05:07.719 --> 05:11.389
Car backs up,
drops the body in the sewer,

05:11.457 --> 05:13.660
And most of the street
sees nothing.

05:13.727 --> 05:15.663
- Any pieces of him
in the trash truck?

05:15.731 --> 05:18.633
- Nothing.

05:18.701 --> 05:21.269
Enjoy.

05:21.337 --> 05:23.938
- Thank you.

05:24.006 --> 05:26.575
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

05:26.643 --> 05:27.977
- Ah, don't worry.

05:28.045 --> 05:30.345
After ten minutes,
it'll still smell like hell.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.780
- Assuming I last ten minutes.

05:32.847 --> 05:34.348
- Well, the trash
acts like a mulch pile,

05:34.415 --> 05:36.049
Accelerating decomposition.

05:36.116 --> 05:38.017
I'll need the autopsy
to determine t.O.D.

05:38.085 --> 05:39.619
- Lucky the debris
clogged this compartment,

05:39.686 --> 05:41.220
Or he could have made it
to the river.

05:41.288 --> 05:43.756
- Yeah, wouldn't that
have been a shame?

05:43.824 --> 05:45.258
- He's a real mess.

05:45.326 --> 05:47.095
Are these wounds premortem?

05:47.162 --> 05:50.298
- Yeah. Maybe beaten
with a tire iron or fire poker.

05:50.366 --> 05:51.632
But whatever blow killed him

05:51.700 --> 05:53.300
Was probably
done to his head.

05:53.368 --> 05:54.968
- Which along
with the hands and feet

05:55.036 --> 05:56.469
Were chopped off.

05:56.537 --> 05:59.272
- No, I'm guessing,
by marks on the bone,

05:59.340 --> 06:00.974
They were sawed off.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.642
- Oh.

06:02.709 --> 06:05.144
Hey, look at this
on the shoulder,

06:05.212 --> 06:08.480
This scar from surgery.

06:08.548 --> 06:11.317
That could give us something.

06:11.384 --> 06:12.518
- You were right.

06:12.586 --> 06:15.221
We caught a break
from his shoulder surgery.

06:15.289 --> 06:18.224
Serial numbers
on an intramedullary rod.

06:18.292 --> 06:20.993
Traced it to a doctor
in scranton, pennsylvania.

06:21.061 --> 06:22.161
- Mm. Mm.

06:22.229 --> 06:25.198
Kevin denaburg, age 26.

06:25.265 --> 06:27.200
- A reciprocating saw was used

06:27.267 --> 06:29.067
To sever his hands,
feet, and head.

06:29.135 --> 06:31.336
Blade pattern is standard
for half a dozen brands.

06:31.403 --> 06:33.470
- All of which are available
from hardware stores

06:33.538 --> 06:34.838
In the tri-state area.

06:34.906 --> 06:38.677
- Anything new
on these wounds?

06:38.745 --> 06:42.681
- This elongated bruise
and the gouging...

06:42.749 --> 06:46.486
Closest match we could make
was from a car door.

06:46.554 --> 06:49.623
- Slammed to death
with a car door?

06:49.690 --> 06:52.592
[scoffs]
that's a first for me.

06:55.928 --> 06:55.994
- Yeno problemitreh ght.L he

06:55.995 --> 06:56.028
.

06:57.396 --> 06:58.963
- Yen- we'll need to seel he
the lease application.

06:59.031 --> 07:00.098
- Yeah, I got that.

07:00.166 --> 07:02.501
- So, uh, you know
where he worked, huh?

07:02.568 --> 07:05.237
- Yeah, where most people
work these days--nowhere.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.974
- How'd he make the rent?
- He had help--girlfriend.

07:08.042 --> 07:09.108
- What's she do?

07:09.176 --> 07:10.677
- A model.
Always looked great.

07:10.745 --> 07:12.145
- Her name?

07:12.213 --> 07:14.982
- Called her...
Amber.

07:15.049 --> 07:17.284
- Amber.
Amber...?

07:17.352 --> 07:19.987
You didn't check her mail?
What's her last name?

07:20.054 --> 07:22.556
- I don't snoop.

07:22.623 --> 07:26.559
- Well, there's only
men's clothing here,

07:26.627 --> 07:29.328
But a bunch
of empty hangers.

07:29.395 --> 07:31.197
Maybe amber's on the run.

07:31.265 --> 07:33.834
- Cupboards are pulled open
in the kitchen.

07:33.901 --> 07:36.670
Wonder what she'd have been
looking for in there.

07:36.738 --> 07:38.873
- That's interesting.
Hey, what's this?

07:38.941 --> 07:40.775
What are these, swag bags?

07:40.843 --> 07:42.109
That's what they call these.

07:42.177 --> 07:45.344
Look, two of them--
more her thing.

07:45.412 --> 07:49.378
There's pricey stuff here--
gucci and chanel.

07:49.446 --> 07:51.578
How do you say that--
l'occitane?

07:51.646 --> 07:53.177
- From high-end events?

07:53.245 --> 07:56.676
I don't see kevin denaburg
being on those donor lists.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.209
- You're gonna like this.

07:58.277 --> 08:02.842
A seating card
for amber donelli.

08:02.908 --> 08:04.340
- Same name
on these receipts

08:04.408 --> 08:06.706
From an upper east side
dry cleaner.

08:06.774 --> 08:10.640
Judging by what they charge,
she's fussy about her clothes.

08:12.106 --> 08:14.806
- So we know who she is
and what she is.

08:14.874 --> 08:17.040
- Well, serena thinks
that in amber's case,

08:17.107 --> 08:20.008
"model" means maybe--
maybe something else.

08:20.075 --> 08:22.276
- Yeah, we didn't find
any professional photos of her

08:22.344 --> 08:23.744
Or head shots.

08:23.812 --> 08:26.246
- If she fled to avoid us,
maybe she took them with her.

08:26.314 --> 08:28.348
- I don't think
that we caused the fleeing.

08:28.416 --> 08:30.249
She left
too many bread crumbs.

08:30.317 --> 08:33.217
- Dry cleaner said she picked up
all her clothes four days ago.

08:33.285 --> 08:35.119
- Okay, we know amber
paid the rent.

08:35.187 --> 08:36.253
What about credit cards?

08:36.321 --> 08:38.422
- Cash only,
since filing for bankruptcy

08:38.489 --> 08:39.923
Two years ago.

08:39.990 --> 08:44.393
- Kevin's lease application
has a bank reference.

08:44.461 --> 08:46.862
That should get you started.

08:46.929 --> 08:49.264
- Well, kevin
might have been out of work,

08:49.332 --> 08:50.832
But he had
some earning power.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.401
He cashed a $10,000 check
four months ago.

08:53.469 --> 08:54.969
- Really?
From whom?

08:55.036 --> 08:57.104
- From eli gold enterprises.

08:57.172 --> 08:59.239
- The eli gold?

08:59.307 --> 09:01.140
- Should I know who that is?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.142
- You don't spend
much time online.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.276
- Only work-related.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.312
- Mm-hmm. No kids to help
with their homework.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.747
- Fortunately...

09:09.815 --> 09:10.914
For their sake.

09:10.982 --> 09:12.282
- Well, it happens to be

09:12.349 --> 09:15.084
That eli gold has the biggest
gossip site on the web--

09:15.151 --> 09:16.552
Thefamehound.Com.

09:16.619 --> 09:18.219
- Right, so it's, uh...

09:18.287 --> 09:19.620
What is it, recreational?

09:19.688 --> 09:22.255
- It's a silly guilty pleasure
I share with my daughter

09:22.323 --> 09:24.457
When, uh, she's finished
her homework, of course.

09:24.525 --> 09:25.925
- Yes, right.
Of course.

09:25.992 --> 09:27.927
- But if, uh...

09:27.994 --> 09:31.865
Mr. Gold
is kicking out $10,000...

09:31.932 --> 09:33.099
- Right.

09:33.167 --> 09:34.534
- Yeah, it was photos.

09:34.602 --> 09:36.403
Second-tier actors
doing blow at a party.

09:36.470 --> 09:38.571
And, you know, today's c-list
is tomorrow's a-list,

09:38.639 --> 09:40.005
So I just bought it
as file stuff.

09:40.073 --> 09:41.740
- Uh-huh.
Now, we don't see kevin

09:41.807 --> 09:43.674
As having traveled so much
in celebrity circles.

09:43.742 --> 09:44.875
What's the story there?

09:44.942 --> 09:46.576
- No, no, no, no,
his girlfriend got around,

09:46.644 --> 09:48.377
And she knew the value
of the little button

09:48.445 --> 09:49.444
On the side of a cell phone.

09:49.512 --> 09:51.380
- Mm. Amber donelli
took the photos.

09:51.447 --> 09:53.348
- Yeah, yeah, amber,
so he said.

09:53.416 --> 09:54.949
- Yeah, did he say
what she did, by the way?

09:55.017 --> 09:56.384
- You know, hot girl?

09:56.452 --> 09:58.586
You know, kevin used to brag
that she paid his rent.

09:58.654 --> 10:00.454
Do the math.
You got her profession.

10:00.522 --> 10:02.022
- I see.
He was okay with that?

10:02.090 --> 10:04.224
- You know, when he came
offering more photos,

10:04.291 --> 10:07.292
He said that he was moving her
toward a career change.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.627
- More photos?
More c-list actors?

10:09.695 --> 10:12.262
- Well, nothing that I wanted.
- Come on.

10:12.330 --> 10:15.131
What rates a pass in the world
of the tabloids these days?

10:15.198 --> 10:18.099
- People with lawyers
on retainer

10:18.167 --> 10:21.802
Who can devour
the likes of me.

10:21.869 --> 10:23.603
- Lawyers on retainer...

10:23.670 --> 10:25.003
Businessmen.

10:27.406 --> 10:31.007
Wall-streeters?

10:31.075 --> 10:32.976
- Is it wall str--
it's wall-streeters.

10:33.044 --> 10:35.111

we got you.
It's wall--it is.

10:35.179 --> 10:37.946
Which one?
Which wall-streeter?

10:38.014 --> 10:39.414
- Since I wouldn't buy
the photos,

10:39.482 --> 10:41.549
It's got to be obvious
I'm not gonna name names.

10:47.322 --> 10:49.289
- You okay?

10:49.357 --> 10:51.124
- Fine.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.160
- You're on the bonus roster,

10:54.227 --> 10:59.064
And this is the key
to gil hardy's office.

10:59.132 --> 11:02.100
I want you out of that hole
you've been stuck in.

11:06.571 --> 11:09.505
- You know
how grateful I am.

11:09.573 --> 11:11.340
- I do.

11:17.613 --> 11:21.014
- [shuddering]

11:27.721 --> 11:28.854
[door opens]

11:28.922 --> 11:30.189
- Dad!

11:30.256 --> 11:32.891
- Hey, buddy.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.460
Hi.
- Daddy.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.494
- Hi, sweetie.

11:36.562 --> 11:37.795
- All right, kids,
go back inside.

11:37.862 --> 11:39.829
Get washed up for dinner.

11:39.896 --> 11:41.764
What's going on?

11:41.832 --> 11:44.334
Your cell was turned off,
and I've been waiting.

11:44.402 --> 11:46.204
- Oh, I had to take
the car in for service.

11:46.272 --> 11:48.775
- Well, come on in.
Food's getting cold.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.545
Oh, and, david,
what is that smell?

11:50.612 --> 11:51.981
It's all the way
in the kitchen?

11:52.049 --> 11:53.618
- Solvent.

11:53.685 --> 11:55.355
I was just cleaning
some tools.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.593
- Oh. Well, can you
get rid of it before we eat?

11:57.660 --> 11:59.597
- Sure.

11:59.665 --> 12:02.837
- Okay, guys, time to eat.
Wash your hands.

12:40.079 --> 12:42.147
- The search at kevin's found
a stack of business cards

12:42.214 --> 12:44.415
For an outfit called
platinum encounters.

12:44.483 --> 12:46.384
- Platinum encounters?

12:46.452 --> 12:47.986
Sometimes
it's all in the name.

12:48.053 --> 12:49.387
- Mm-hmm.

12:49.455 --> 12:52.791
The owner is a woman named
sierra brandis, columbia mba--

12:52.859 --> 12:54.259
Very 21st century.

12:54.327 --> 12:57.429
Her website offers a list
of very tony events,

12:57.496 --> 13:01.898
For which she provides
female embellishment.

13:01.966 --> 13:03.800
- High-end cattle call, huh?

13:03.868 --> 13:05.901
Executives, martinis,

13:05.969 --> 13:08.436
And a room full
of beautiful women.

13:08.503 --> 13:11.068
- I think sierra brandis
is our best potential source,

13:11.136 --> 13:14.904
But she's probably too smart
to pass on to us what she knows.

13:14.972 --> 13:16.672
- I got a thought on that.

13:16.740 --> 13:18.843
- Hmm?

13:18.910 --> 13:20.344
- Serena...

13:23.215 --> 13:24.983
[mouths words]

13:44.366 --> 13:45.699
- [british accent]
well, I really appreciate

13:45.767 --> 13:47.033
You seeing me.

13:47.101 --> 13:49.535
- Always a need
for new faces...

13:49.603 --> 13:51.537
Especially lovely new faces.

13:51.604 --> 13:53.671
You said that you worked
in europe?

13:53.739 --> 13:55.139
- Yeah.

13:55.207 --> 13:56.807
I did some conferences

13:56.875 --> 13:59.376
<i>For the union de banques suisses
in geneva</i>

13:59.444 --> 14:02.278
And a few private investors
groups in london.

14:02.346 --> 14:04.280
- You speak
any other languages?

14:04.348 --> 14:05.448
- French, spanish--

14:05.516 --> 14:07.483
I get around pretty well
in Italy.

14:07.551 --> 14:08.751
- Worldly, I like it.

14:08.819 --> 14:09.752
- You know, honestly,

14:09.820 --> 14:11.287
I was concerned
I was being passed over

14:11.355 --> 14:13.089
Because I was too worldly.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.256
- Oh, not
with your looks, hon.

14:14.324 --> 14:16.491
In new york,
all that class and elegance,

14:16.559 --> 14:18.693
I could book you
every night.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.994
- Really?

14:20.062 --> 14:21.895
You know, in europe,

14:21.963 --> 14:25.999
It often went
beyond mere attendance.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.601
I don't say that
as a complaint.

14:28.669 --> 14:30.002
- Then why say it?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.771
- The girl
who gave me your card,

14:31.838 --> 14:34.406
She implied that real money
might come that way.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.108
- And she have a name?

14:36.175 --> 14:38.709
- Amber donelli.

14:38.777 --> 14:40.011
- Amber...
[chuckles]

14:40.078 --> 14:41.845
And when did you see her?

14:41.913 --> 14:44.347
- A while back,
maybe a month ago.

14:44.415 --> 14:48.351
- And her boyfriend, kevin,
you ever meet him?

14:48.419 --> 14:50.621
- She mentioned him,
but, no.

14:50.688 --> 14:53.990
- He's trouble.
Stay away from him.

14:54.058 --> 14:55.625
- Really? Trouble?

14:55.692 --> 14:58.160
- Never mind that.
Back to the fun.

14:58.228 --> 15:00.329
That guy
at the end of the bar,

15:00.397 --> 15:02.597
When I leave,
he's gonna hit on you.

15:02.665 --> 15:03.998
And if your rent's due

15:04.066 --> 15:05.400
Or you want new earrings

15:05.468 --> 15:08.136
Or maybe you're just up
for a dinner at alain ducasse,

15:08.204 --> 15:10.372
It's all there and waiting.

15:10.439 --> 15:13.308
Get in touch.

15:17.012 --> 15:19.947
- Well, it's not
your lucky night.

15:25.586 --> 15:28.587
[whistling and applause]

15:32.758 --> 15:34.125
[normal voice]
nichols.

15:34.192 --> 15:36.160
- Detective.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.861
- Well, sierra brandis
runs a tight ship.

15:38.929 --> 15:41.330
- Yeah? Legal?

15:41.398 --> 15:43.067
- Skirts the edge.

15:43.134 --> 15:45.269
Offers ambitious women

15:45.337 --> 15:47.672
Access to a pool
of wealthy men.

15:47.740 --> 15:49.608
- Really?
Any talk of our victim?

15:49.675 --> 15:52.777
- She described
kevin denaburg as trouble.

15:52.845 --> 15:54.412
- Say what kind of trouble?

15:54.480 --> 15:56.281
- No.

15:56.349 --> 15:57.383
Mm-mm.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.617
- So that's all you got?

15:58.685 --> 16:00.853
- Yeah.

16:00.921 --> 16:02.288
And what did you accomplish?

16:02.355 --> 16:04.223
- I, uh, was thinking
that if amber

16:04.291 --> 16:08.260
Traded up
from her tabloid informant

16:08.328 --> 16:11.730
To a murderous, door-slamming,
wall street executive type,

16:11.798 --> 16:15.000
She might have met him
at, uh, this party,

16:15.068 --> 16:17.135
Given by
willoughby bank and trust.

16:17.203 --> 16:19.938
Turns out that the executive
in charge of fun and games

16:20.005 --> 16:22.974
Is a guy named david novak.

16:23.041 --> 16:25.376
- Nice.

16:27.579 --> 16:29.180
You haveni vieery cew. V

16:29.248 --> 16:30.782
- St  ill getting used to it.

16:30.849 --> 16:33.251
Just moved
from a lower floor.

16:33.319 --> 16:34.819
- Hey, you were
in the service, huh?

16:34.887 --> 16:36.954
- Yeah, my reserve unit
was called up.

16:37.022 --> 16:38.790
- O.I.F.?
- Yes, two tours.

16:38.858 --> 16:40.725
- Oh, yeah?
What's that?

16:40.793 --> 16:42.994
- Operation iraqi freedom.

16:43.062 --> 16:46.798
My father is usmc,
retired.

16:46.866 --> 16:49.300
- That's me and our ceo,
nathan grayson.

16:49.368 --> 16:51.334
We were stationed together.

16:51.402 --> 16:53.703
- Mm.
That's how you wound up here?

16:53.771 --> 16:55.605
- Well, nathan felt

16:55.673 --> 16:58.108
I was working
below my qualifications

16:58.175 --> 17:00.176
At waterman's insurance.

17:03.512 --> 17:05.512
- Yeah. Hey, did you see
those gift bags?

17:05.580 --> 17:07.717
They're branded
with the bank logo.

17:07.784 --> 17:09.883
- Yeah, that's from
our fashion week party.

17:09.950 --> 17:12.185
- Do you remember seeing
either one of these two people

17:12.252 --> 17:15.020
At those events?

17:15.088 --> 17:17.255
- [scoffs]
we had so many guests.

17:17.323 --> 17:19.156
- Well, she wouldn't
have been a guest.

17:19.224 --> 17:20.891
This girl here
is amber donelli.

17:20.959 --> 17:23.794
She worked
for platinum encounters.

17:23.862 --> 17:26.796
- She's a circuit girl.
You know the term?

17:26.864 --> 17:28.464
Ge
- what's this about?

17:28.531 --> 17:30.065
- This fella in the picture,

17:30.133 --> 17:33.135
He was murdered.

17:33.203 --> 17:35.770
- Huh.
Well, I've never seen him.

17:35.838 --> 17:37.438
- Mm-hmm.

17:37.506 --> 17:38.539
- Detective, my job

17:38.607 --> 17:40.174
Is attending to the needs
of our clients.

17:40.241 --> 17:43.043
I don't interact
with the models we hire.

17:43.110 --> 17:44.310
- Does anyone else
at this bank

17:44.378 --> 17:45.845
Interact
with the models you hire?

17:45.913 --> 17:47.246
- The answer is no.

17:47.314 --> 17:48.881
I really don't like
where this is going.

17:48.948 --> 17:50.315
- Mr. Novak...

17:50.383 --> 17:53.985
Uh, a bevy of ladies like this
at a fashion week party

17:54.053 --> 17:55.653
With all your cohorts--
no interaction?

17:55.721 --> 17:57.354
That goes right into
the "who you kidding" file.

17:57.422 --> 17:59.156
- I don't care
what file it goes into.

17:59.224 --> 18:01.691
I really shouldn't continue
without benefit of counsel.

18:01.759 --> 18:03.993
- Oh.

18:04.061 --> 18:05.194
W-what happened?

18:05.262 --> 18:07.796
A minute ago, you seemed
inclined to be helpful.

18:07.864 --> 18:10.332
[phone ringing]

18:10.400 --> 18:13.101
- Do you mind?
I-I have to take this.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.772
- Okay.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.507
- You can tell your counsel

18:20.575 --> 18:22.876
He can avoid a lengthy
subpoena of all records

18:22.944 --> 18:24.178
If we get a list now

18:24.245 --> 18:28.782
Of all the people
attending those events.

18:28.850 --> 18:31.618
- You know,
most mid-level guys

18:31.686 --> 18:33.420
Who play
that glad-handing role

18:33.488 --> 18:35.188
Are people pleasers.

18:35.256 --> 18:37.657
You know, it's their job
to make everybody happy.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.893
They satisfy the clients.
They satisfy the boss.

18:39.961 --> 18:40.961
- Uh-huh.

18:41.028 --> 18:43.997
- He was, uh,
oddly empowered.

18:44.064 --> 18:46.099
- Good point.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.902
- Yeah, so, anyway,
how many on this list

18:48.969 --> 18:51.004
Had interaction with amber?

18:51.071 --> 18:52.238
[cell phone chirps]

18:52.306 --> 18:54.574
It's gonna take
some interview time.

18:54.641 --> 18:56.642
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, maybe not.

18:56.710 --> 19:00.046
Amber was picked up
in jersey city a half hour ago.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.116
- Look, I didn't even know
kevin was dead.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.651
- So why were you running?

19:05.719 --> 19:07.453
- I wasn't running.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.854
We had a fight.

19:08.922 --> 19:11.257
I left him. I was looking
for a new place to live.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.326
- With someone wealthy,
more desirable?

19:14.394 --> 19:16.929
We know you work
with sierra brandis.

19:16.996 --> 19:18.430
- So what?

19:18.498 --> 19:20.833
I was making good money.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.902
[scoffs] I didn't want kevin
screwing it up.

19:26.205 --> 19:28.907
We fought, I moved out--
simple as that.

19:28.975 --> 19:31.343
- And kevin was selling

19:31.411 --> 19:34.079
What you'd provided to him
to the tabloids

19:34.147 --> 19:36.014
And maybe using it
for blackmail.

19:36.082 --> 19:39.617
How'd you feel about that,
first of all?

19:39.685 --> 19:40.952
- Am I under arrest?

19:41.020 --> 19:43.788
- You're here
on a material-witness warrant.

19:43.856 --> 19:45.223
- So I can leave.
- You can.

19:45.290 --> 19:47.725
And you can return
under a murder warrant.

19:47.793 --> 19:49.827
We have options.

19:52.598 --> 19:54.432
- [scoffs]

19:54.499 --> 19:56.267
Okay.

19:58.270 --> 20:00.704
Kevin was trying to put
the squeeze on someone,

20:00.772 --> 20:02.739
A wall street bigwig--

20:02.807 --> 20:06.109
Married,
lots of money, great car,

20:06.177 --> 20:09.513
And some expensive
weird sexual preferences.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.748
- Weird?
Like what?

20:11.816 --> 20:14.684
- Dressing up,
combat makeup--

20:14.752 --> 20:16.820
I played
the terrified victim.

20:16.887 --> 20:18.888
Not something
he'd want to share

20:18.956 --> 20:20.623
With his friends
at the country club.

20:20.691 --> 20:22.625
- You have photos,
videotape, what?

20:22.693 --> 20:25.829
- [sighs]
kevin put a camera

20:25.896 --> 20:27.863
In a laptop computer.

20:27.931 --> 20:31.132
I'd set it up in the hotel room
and press record.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.101
- This wall street character--

20:34.169 --> 20:36.537
Amber,
we're gonna need a name.

20:38.740 --> 20:41.374
- [sighs]

20:41.442 --> 20:44.343
I can give you a name.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.247
[car door opens]

20:48.314 --> 20:51.716
- What's up?

20:51.784 --> 20:53.451
- You didn't return my calls.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.653
- I'm jammed up.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.360
You're gonna need a better ride
to go with that new office.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.496
Let's have breakfast
tomorrow.

21:03.564 --> 21:06.600
- Sure.

21:11.945 --> 21:14.947
[engine turning]

21:25.226 --> 21:26.827
- David?

21:26.895 --> 21:29.496
- Nathan trusts me
with his life.

21:29.564 --> 21:32.366
I need to know,
do you trust me too?

21:32.434 --> 21:35.336
- Of course I trust you.

21:35.404 --> 21:36.905
I love you.

21:39.642 --> 21:41.343
- Oh.

21:41.411 --> 21:43.479
I know. I know.

21:43.547 --> 21:45.949
[sobbing]

21:46.016 --> 21:49.019
- Something triggered
the dream and the sweats.

21:49.086 --> 21:50.921
What?

21:54.091 --> 21:56.059
- Nothing.
- No.

21:56.127 --> 21:58.461
We went through this
after you came back.

21:58.529 --> 22:00.096
You remember?
You remember how we talked?

22:00.164 --> 22:02.533
- Everything I do
is for us!

22:02.600 --> 22:04.435
Everything.

22:08.773 --> 22:10.707
[sniffles]

22:13.444 --> 22:16.279
Just believe me...

22:19.349 --> 22:22.517
Whatever happens,

22:22.585 --> 22:25.954
I need you so much.

22:34.791 --> 22:36.759
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:36.827 --> 22:38.765
I hired models,
that's all.

22:38.833 --> 22:40.806
- And you sampled
the merchandise.

22:40.874 --> 22:41.842
- Excuse me?

22:41.909 --> 22:44.278
- Amber donelli,
that so-called model--

22:44.346 --> 22:46.783
We talked about her yesterday.
I-I showed you the picture.

22:46.851 --> 22:49.990
She claims that you and she
had a sexual relationship.

22:50.057 --> 22:51.958
- A sexual--no.

22:52.026 --> 22:53.760
You're wrong.
I'm a married man.

22:53.828 --> 22:55.862
- Well, I'm betting
most of the clients

22:55.930 --> 22:58.764
That use platinum encounters
are married too.

22:58.832 --> 23:00.365
- But amber donelli

23:00.433 --> 23:03.001
Does connect you
to kevin denaburg.

23:03.068 --> 23:04.736
- I told you,
I don't know him.

23:04.803 --> 23:06.437
- Kevin had pictures of you.

23:06.505 --> 23:07.839
Was he blackmailing you,
mr. Novak?

23:07.906 --> 23:09.940
- You don't have
to answer that, david.

23:10.008 --> 23:11.341
Nathan grayson.

23:11.409 --> 23:13.243
- I'm detective nichols.

23:13.310 --> 23:16.579
This is, uh, my partner,
detective stevens.

23:16.647 --> 23:18.514
- Look, I appreciate
that you have a job to do,

23:18.582 --> 23:20.551
But, uh, david
is entitled to counsel.

23:20.619 --> 23:22.218
- You're aware
of his association

23:22.286 --> 23:23.720
With high-end prostitutes?

23:23.787 --> 23:25.354
- I'm not.

23:25.422 --> 23:26.722
But from now on,

23:26.790 --> 23:28.957
I'll direct everything
through our company lawyer.

23:29.025 --> 23:30.625
David is an executive here.

23:30.693 --> 23:32.893
I will not have you
treat him this way.

23:32.961 --> 23:34.728
- Right,
you two served together.

23:34.796 --> 23:37.697
- Yes. We fought side by side
for this country.

23:37.765 --> 23:40.899
- So you know about his
less-than-honorable discharge.

23:40.967 --> 23:44.968
- Two unarmed civilians in iraq
shot to death.

23:45.036 --> 23:46.235
What happened there exactly?

23:46.303 --> 23:48.038
- Hey, people lied.
I was cleared.

23:48.105 --> 23:49.239
- David.
- I was not even charged.

23:49.307 --> 23:50.641
- Stop.

23:50.708 --> 23:53.643
You don't have to justify
anything to these people.

23:53.711 --> 23:55.044
Again, talk to our lawyer.

23:55.112 --> 23:57.180
Now, if you'll excuse us,
david has work,

23:57.248 --> 24:00.550
And I am late
for a luncheon.

24:10.161 --> 24:12.629
[door closes]

24:12.696 --> 24:14.096
- Hey, dad.
- Hi.

24:14.164 --> 24:16.032
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

24:16.099 --> 24:18.868
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Nice to see you.

24:18.936 --> 24:20.771
Shall we?

24:23.275 --> 24:26.377
- So union club?
- That sounds great.

24:26.445 --> 24:29.715
- Nice,
being one of the gods.

24:33.320 --> 24:36.322
- Nathan grayson
is a well-respected ceo.

24:36.390 --> 24:38.191
Do you really think
he's capable?

24:38.259 --> 24:40.860
- An ego-driven
power position like that?

24:40.928 --> 24:43.229
You know, it takes
a certain kind of narcissist

24:43.297 --> 24:44.964
To run a fortune 500.

24:45.032 --> 24:49.102
And amber donelli talked
about a bigwig wall street type

24:49.170 --> 24:51.804
With expensive kinky tastes.

24:51.872 --> 24:53.406
- David novak is low-level.

24:53.473 --> 24:54.941
Nathan grayson
has the real power.

24:55.008 --> 24:56.509
- Okay.

24:56.576 --> 24:57.844
You have a hunch,

24:57.911 --> 25:00.382
But it shouldn't take this
off of david novak.

25:00.449 --> 25:02.386
Find proof
he had sex with amber.

25:02.454 --> 25:04.291
- There's not one call,
text, or email.

25:04.359 --> 25:05.862
- Hey, you know
what I'm thinking?

25:05.929 --> 25:08.764
Kevin maybe
stalked her movements.

25:08.832 --> 25:09.765
- Hmm.

25:09.833 --> 25:12.100
- We have his cell phone.

25:13.669 --> 25:14.935
- Yeah.

25:15.003 --> 25:17.571
We'll do a gps trace,
check hotels in the area.

25:17.639 --> 25:20.240
- Good.

25:20.308 --> 25:22.375
- The doorman
at this midtown hotel

25:22.443 --> 25:24.478
Confirms david gave him
cash for rooms.

25:24.545 --> 25:27.649
- And about a week ago,
he's caught on tape

25:27.717 --> 25:30.052
With--watch this.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.455
That's kevin denaburg.

25:32.523 --> 25:35.293
- Okay, amber's testimony
plus this?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.596
Time for the d.A.

25:37.663 --> 25:39.664
- Well...

25:39.732 --> 25:41.264
- Am I sensing hesitation?

25:41.332 --> 25:44.733
- Look, david doesn't put up
any kind of fight.

25:44.801 --> 25:47.069
He's an iraq war veteran,

25:47.136 --> 25:48.403
Two tours.

25:48.471 --> 25:52.174
We talk to him,
he's tense, on edge.

25:52.242 --> 25:56.246
But when kevin
attacks him right here,

25:56.314 --> 25:59.048
He doesn't turn violent.

25:59.116 --> 26:02.684
- Unless he saved
the best for last--

26:02.752 --> 26:07.088
Sawing off kevin's head,
hands, and feet.

26:07.156 --> 26:09.956
- That may be true.

26:13.122 --> 26:14.586
[children chattering]

26:14.654 --> 26:16.254
- Let's go, guys.

26:16.321 --> 26:18.189
You got your presents?
- Yeah.

26:18.257 --> 26:19.590
[siren wails]

26:19.658 --> 26:22.093
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What's that?

26:22.161 --> 26:24.830
- Come here.
Come here.

26:24.898 --> 26:27.767
- David, what in the world?
- I'll deal with it.

26:32.071 --> 26:34.838
- Please, I'm taking my kids
to a birthday party.

26:34.906 --> 26:36.073
- It doesn't work
that way, david.

26:36.140 --> 26:38.408
Open the, uh, back
of your car, please.

26:38.476 --> 26:40.676
- No, not in front
of my kids.

26:40.744 --> 26:43.378
- I'll take them.
- Dad, what's happening?

26:43.446 --> 26:45.913
- Cynthia, wait.

26:45.981 --> 26:48.448
- Amber calls this
a great car?

26:48.516 --> 26:52.017
- Open the back
of your car, mr. Novak.

26:56.921 --> 26:58.188
It's clean.

26:58.256 --> 27:02.490
- It's too clean.
This liner has been replaced.

27:02.558 --> 27:04.358
We need to impound your car.

27:04.425 --> 27:07.594
- And we're gonna conduct
a full search of your home.

27:07.661 --> 27:10.897
- This is all wrong.

27:34.835 --> 27:37.335
- Shape and size
of the blade is similar.

27:37.402 --> 27:40.571
Bag and send
to forensics a.S.A.P.

27:40.639 --> 27:43.874
I think we got
enough here to arrest.

27:48.613 --> 27:50.714
- We're good.

27:53.484 --> 27:55.351
- You need to stay back,
mrs. Novak.

27:55.419 --> 27:57.352
- Please, he's my husband.

27:57.420 --> 28:00.354
- We'll be okay.
I promise.

28:03.356 --> 28:04.856
- This is devastating.

28:04.924 --> 28:07.359
I mean, david is not
just an employee.

28:07.426 --> 28:09.494
He's--he's a friend.

28:09.561 --> 28:11.395
- So you knew
about the prostitutes?

28:11.463 --> 28:13.664
- No, not--
not really knew.

28:13.732 --> 28:16.433
You know, but--
but people work long hours.

28:16.501 --> 28:18.968
It's stressful.

28:19.036 --> 28:20.302
Some need to play.

28:20.370 --> 28:23.204
- You ever play,
mr. Grayson?

28:23.272 --> 28:26.473
- I resent that, detective.
This is about david, not me.

28:26.541 --> 28:28.975
Let's move on to areas
that can be more helpful.

28:29.042 --> 28:31.310
- Yeah, that's
what we're looking for--

28:31.377 --> 28:33.144
Always helpful.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.579
So in that vein,

28:34.647 --> 28:36.880
Can you tell us more
about your relationship

28:36.948 --> 28:38.181
With your friend david?

28:38.249 --> 28:40.183
Back in iraq,

28:40.251 --> 28:43.218
Any problems
when you guys served together?

28:43.286 --> 28:44.820
- I always believed in him,

28:44.887 --> 28:47.689
Even after his trouble
over there.

28:47.756 --> 28:49.156
- The dead civilians.

28:49.224 --> 28:51.958
- Nobody believed
those iraqi witnesses.

28:52.026 --> 28:54.794
Even my father weighed in
with his connections

28:54.862 --> 28:56.129
To help david out.

28:56.197 --> 28:57.997
- And what were david's duties
here at the bank?

28:58.065 --> 28:59.932
- David's easy to like.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.100
He's good
with clients, so...

29:02.168 --> 29:03.501
- Yeah, planning parties

29:03.569 --> 29:05.837
And showing clients
a good time--

29:05.905 --> 29:07.338
That's what
brought him in contact

29:07.406 --> 29:10.442
With the murder victim, huh?

29:10.510 --> 29:12.344
The boyfriend
of one of the prostitutes

29:12.412 --> 29:14.179
With whom he was consorting.

29:14.247 --> 29:18.749
- You seem to know
a good deal more than I do.

29:18.817 --> 29:20.851
Uh, look, detectives,

29:20.919 --> 29:24.021
I want to be helpful
putting this behind us,

29:24.088 --> 29:26.690
But, uh, unfortunately,
right now...

29:26.758 --> 29:28.425
I'm late for a meeting,

29:28.493 --> 29:31.094
So if--if you don't mind...

29:32.596 --> 29:34.797
- Yeah, sure.
Absolutely.

29:34.865 --> 29:38.200
You have been,
in fact, very helpful.

29:38.268 --> 29:39.769
We'll be in touch.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.240
- He means that.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.147
My guess is
the last thing he needs

29:53.215 --> 29:55.282
Is a scandal
with some prostitute.

29:55.350 --> 29:57.551
Throwing david under the bus
makes a certain sense.

29:57.619 --> 29:58.885
- Yeah, what he's
really trying to avoid

29:58.953 --> 30:01.654
Is a bigger scandal--
killing kevin denaburg.

30:01.722 --> 30:03.222
- Well, it's still a leap,

30:03.290 --> 30:04.923
Given the mountain of evidence
against david.

30:04.991 --> 30:06.325
- Wait. Wait.

30:06.392 --> 30:10.463
David, in iraq, is accused
of killing unarmed civilians,

30:10.531 --> 30:13.572
But nathan grayson's father
puts his reputation on the line

30:13.639 --> 30:14.807
For a guy he's never met?

30:14.875 --> 30:17.576
- There's an expression,
"bleeding army green"--

30:17.644 --> 30:19.745
What you'll do
for the men you serve with.

30:19.813 --> 30:23.082
- Or what a father'll do
for family, for his son.

30:23.150 --> 30:25.351
- With all
we're putting david through,

30:25.419 --> 30:26.619
I hope you're wrong.

30:26.687 --> 30:28.454
- 'cause if I'm right,

30:28.522 --> 30:31.023
We're charging the wrong guy
with murder.

30:34.477 --> 30:36.244
- Aren't you supposed
to build cases

30:36.312 --> 30:37.546
And not take them apart?

30:37.614 --> 30:39.248
- I just think
it's a very strong possibility

30:39.316 --> 30:40.817
That david
is covering for nathan.

30:40.884 --> 30:43.318
- I can't go to the d.A.
With that.

30:43.385 --> 30:44.419
- Well, there's also the car

30:44.486 --> 30:46.254
That amber described
as "a great car."

30:46.321 --> 30:48.522
- Which doesn't fit
david's suv.

30:48.590 --> 30:51.124
- So maybe he rented
a ferrari to impress her.

30:51.192 --> 30:52.926
It still doesn't link
nathan grayson

30:52.993 --> 30:54.961
To the killing
of kevin denaburg.

30:55.028 --> 30:56.929
- Here, will this help?

30:56.997 --> 30:58.597
Take a look at those.

31:03.269 --> 31:05.069
- It might mean complicity,

31:05.137 --> 31:06.904
But blood from the victim

31:06.971 --> 31:10.874
Matches samples found
on david's saw and in his car.

31:10.941 --> 31:12.575
- Because he dealt
with the body,

31:12.643 --> 31:13.909
But that's all he did.

31:13.977 --> 31:15.578
The murder weapon
was a car door.

31:15.646 --> 31:17.914
The wounds on kevin denaburg

31:17.981 --> 31:19.882
Don't match the measurements

31:19.949 --> 31:24.287
Of the toyotas that are driven
by david or s wife.

31:26.624 --> 31:28.291
- And nathan grayson?

31:28.359 --> 31:31.360
- Registration shows
that he has an s-class mercedes,

31:31.428 --> 31:33.363
Which a jersey girl
like amber donelli

31:33.431 --> 31:35.832
Could describe
as a great car.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.233
- You're asking me to act

31:37.301 --> 31:39.201
On a vague piece
of circumstantial evidence.

31:39.269 --> 31:40.969
- We think
it's more than that.

31:41.037 --> 31:44.939
- I don't often give orders,
but you both know the problem.

31:45.007 --> 31:47.742
You stay away from david novak
and his lawyer.

31:47.810 --> 31:49.744
Your theory could provide
an alternate theory

31:49.811 --> 31:50.945
For david's defense,

31:51.013 --> 31:53.881
And if he's guilty,
he could go free.

31:56.518 --> 31:58.419
- Detective stevens?
- Mm-hmm?

31:58.487 --> 32:00.255
- Detective, uh...

32:00.322 --> 32:02.257
You know military
legal procedure, yes?

32:02.325 --> 32:03.925
- What, the ucmj?

32:03.992 --> 32:06.622
My--my father wasn't
in the judge advocate's office.

32:06.690 --> 32:07.990
- From what I know,

32:08.058 --> 32:10.126
It's very hard to make
a military murder case

32:10.193 --> 32:11.428
Without a body.

32:11.495 --> 32:14.031
- I grew up learning
how much they like hard facts.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.367
- At the time this happened,
do you remember?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.269
Terror killings
were rampant.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.270
Civilians murdered
by death squads,

32:20.338 --> 32:21.872
Even corrupt police--
you remember that?

32:21.939 --> 32:23.573
- Yeah, there were
mass graves everywhere,

32:23.641 --> 32:24.841
Bodies strewn.

32:24.909 --> 32:27.042
- Bodies whose
heads and hands and feet

32:27.110 --> 32:29.244
Had been cut off.

32:29.312 --> 32:31.813
- To hide their identity...
- Yeah.

32:31.881 --> 32:33.315
- Like our victim.

32:33.383 --> 32:34.850
- That's right.

32:34.917 --> 32:37.853
- Yeah, but that--that points
towards david's guilt,

32:37.921 --> 32:39.254
Not his innocence.

32:39.322 --> 32:40.722
- David moved the body,

32:40.790 --> 32:42.757
And he cut it up just like
he'd done before in iraq,

32:42.825 --> 32:45.727
For nathan.

32:45.795 --> 32:50.065
- We can't go and speak
to david about this.

32:50.132 --> 32:51.400
- That's okay.

32:51.467 --> 32:53.902
I'd rather talk to the wife.

32:53.969 --> 32:55.069
- Okay.

32:55.137 --> 32:57.572
[chuckles]
but you heard callas in there.

32:57.639 --> 33:01.075
There's a line
we can't cross.

33:01.143 --> 33:03.678
- What, are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

33:03.745 --> 33:07.682
You go there, I'll--
I'll terminate the interview.

33:07.749 --> 33:11.018
- Your father
only wanted facts.

33:11.086 --> 33:14.788
My mother taught me to work
within boundaries.

33:18.226 --> 33:20.828
- His prior job
was claims adjuster.

33:20.895 --> 33:22.796
When he got called up
by the reserve,

33:22.864 --> 33:26.099
Our world collapsed,
financially.

33:26.166 --> 33:29.369
- Since then, you seem
to have done pretty well.

33:29.437 --> 33:31.372
- Yeah, we have...

33:31.440 --> 33:33.007
Until now.

33:33.074 --> 33:35.609
But look,
my husband is innocent.

33:35.677 --> 33:38.045
He's not a killer.
He is a good man.

33:38.113 --> 33:39.780
- Nathan grayson...

33:39.848 --> 33:41.716
Isn't a great deal
owed to him?

33:41.783 --> 33:43.617
- What we have
comes from david's hard work,

33:43.685 --> 33:45.219
Not nathan's favors.

33:45.287 --> 33:47.454
- A cushy job
at the bank.

33:47.521 --> 33:50.056
Why do you suppose
nathan gave him that?

33:50.124 --> 33:51.758
- They became close in iraq.

33:51.826 --> 33:54.961
What those guys went through,
nobody can understand.

33:55.029 --> 33:58.064
Those iraqis were always
accusing our servicemen.

33:58.132 --> 33:59.432
The so-called witnesses

33:59.500 --> 34:01.401
Couldn't even pick david
out of a lineup!

34:01.469 --> 34:03.336
- Cynthia...

34:03.404 --> 34:05.972
It's possible
that those witnesses

34:06.040 --> 34:08.574
Didn't see david
doing the crime,

34:08.641 --> 34:10.909
But somebody that david knew.

34:13.013 --> 34:14.746
- I don't understand.

34:14.815 --> 34:16.349
- Well, think about it.

34:16.416 --> 34:19.585
Nathan swoops in
as soon as they come back

34:19.652 --> 34:22.522
And sets him up at the bank.

34:24.591 --> 34:26.525
- Oh, my god.

34:26.592 --> 34:28.527
Nathan?

34:28.596 --> 34:30.797
He took the blame
for nathan?

34:37.701 --> 34:40.203
We'd lost our house.

34:40.271 --> 34:42.272
He was coming back
to no job,

34:42.340 --> 34:44.373
Marked by
a general discharge,

34:44.442 --> 34:46.777
And then everything
suddenly turned around.

34:46.844 --> 34:48.344
- Because of nathan.

34:48.413 --> 34:50.914
- Oh.
[scoffs]

34:50.982 --> 34:53.817
And david thinks nathan
cares about him.

35:00.858 --> 35:03.159
- Mr. Grayson...

35:03.227 --> 35:04.994
Thank you so much
for coming in.

35:05.062 --> 35:07.630
Our captain agreed
that it's, uh, very important

35:07.698 --> 35:09.031
For you to be
part of this process.

35:09.099 --> 35:10.433
Thank you.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.868
- Yeah, well, I'm relieved
to hear somebody listens.

35:12.936 --> 35:14.537
- Yeah.
Fair warning, though--

35:14.604 --> 35:18.007
David's defense is undoubtedly
gonna subpoena you

35:18.075 --> 35:19.408
And try to confuse
the jury about--

35:19.476 --> 35:23.011
- He's actually asked me
for defense counsel.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.512
- Really?

35:24.580 --> 35:26.180
And what, you're gonna--
you're gonna take

35:26.248 --> 35:28.816
A "wait and see" attitude
on that?

35:28.884 --> 35:31.252
Oh, that's
a very smart move.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.687
- Detective,
I was harvard law.

35:33.755 --> 35:36.958
I could teach
courtroom strategy to your d.A.

35:40.396 --> 35:42.464
- Please.

35:46.135 --> 35:47.769
- Wh--what's this?

35:47.837 --> 35:51.139
- Take it easy. We're just gonna
sort some things out--

35:51.207 --> 35:53.508
The details of kevin's death.

35:53.576 --> 35:55.377
- I don't know
anything about that.

35:55.445 --> 35:57.212
- You meet him up in yonkers.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.648
- No.
No, no, I didn't.

35:59.715 --> 36:01.182
- We know you were there.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.085
The gps reading on your car
tells us so.

36:03.153 --> 36:04.957
- Bull.
There's nothing on my system.

36:05.025 --> 36:06.759
- Well, you erased the entry
from your system,

36:06.827 --> 36:08.428
But your gps provider,

36:08.496 --> 36:11.965
They--they store a backup
on their mainframe.

36:15.570 --> 36:19.672
So there's only one thing
we don't get.

36:19.740 --> 36:22.941
We know you used the highlander
to dump the body,

36:23.008 --> 36:26.210
But who was driving
the mercedes?

36:26.277 --> 36:28.111
David?

36:28.179 --> 36:30.713
You're going to jail.

36:30.781 --> 36:32.515
Would you like it to be
for a long time

36:32.582 --> 36:34.717
Or a really long time?

36:34.784 --> 36:37.853
Who drove the other car--
your wife?

36:37.921 --> 36:40.255
She help you?
- Keep my family out of this.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.857
- We talked to her.

36:41.925 --> 36:44.393
She seems
very committed to you.

36:44.461 --> 36:46.228
Seems like she'd do anything
to help you out.

36:46.296 --> 36:48.831
- Enough.
You can't mess with me.

36:48.899 --> 36:50.366
He called--
he called me in a panic.

36:50.433 --> 36:52.802
He said he'd take care of me,
take care of my family.

36:52.869 --> 36:54.303
- I did take care of you.

36:54.371 --> 36:55.537
- You son of a bitch.

36:55.605 --> 36:58.040
I won't let you do this to me,
not anymore!

36:58.107 --> 37:00.976
- David, it won't help you
to alienate me.

37:01.044 --> 37:04.813
- [breathing heavily]

37:12.688 --> 37:15.657
- But you do own a mercedes,

37:15.725 --> 37:18.393
Don't you, mr. Grayson?

37:18.461 --> 37:20.228
- Excuse me?

37:20.296 --> 37:22.864
- S-class, to be exact.

37:22.932 --> 37:24.666
- What does that have to do
with anything?

37:24.733 --> 37:28.569
- Maybe nothing,
possibly everything.

37:30.239 --> 37:31.973
- [chuckles]

37:32.041 --> 37:34.442
Forgive me, detective.

37:34.510 --> 37:36.511
It took me a few minutes
to catch on.

37:36.578 --> 37:40.648
This is quite a interesting
little game you're playing here.

37:40.716 --> 37:41.749
- What do you mean?

37:41.817 --> 37:44.185
- Yeah.

37:44.253 --> 37:47.488
Do us a favor, huh?
Lose the performance.

37:47.556 --> 37:49.523
If he's your star witness,

37:49.591 --> 37:52.059
Your case is already
in the toilet.

37:52.127 --> 37:54.094
- I wouldn't be so sure.

37:54.162 --> 37:58.465
Your flaw is that
you exploit people...

37:58.533 --> 37:59.833
Like david,

37:59.901 --> 38:03.103
'cause you're too weak
to face consequences.

38:03.171 --> 38:05.973
You come up against
a real crisis on your own,

38:06.040 --> 38:08.241
You fold.

38:08.309 --> 38:11.144
You're a coward.

38:11.212 --> 38:15.615
Yeah, amber donelli
called her sex client

38:15.683 --> 38:18.986
By the name david novak,

38:19.053 --> 38:21.889
But, uh,
here in these pictures,

38:21.957 --> 38:25.292

I don't care
what you told her your name was,

38:25.360 --> 38:28.559
That's you, nathan.

38:28.627 --> 38:30.992
Not the kind of thing

38:31.059 --> 38:34.129
That you'd, uh,
want around.

38:34.196 --> 38:37.066
- Ah.
Look at this--

38:37.134 --> 38:40.636
Using david's name,
letting him take the fall.

38:40.704 --> 38:42.938
You almost skated on this.

38:43.006 --> 38:45.040
- First in iraq,
now this.

38:45.108 --> 38:47.976
- You don't know anything.
- We know enough.

38:48.044 --> 38:49.645
- Nothing said here
is of any value.

38:49.712 --> 38:50.746
- Right.

38:50.813 --> 38:53.314
This has all been
just a little something

38:53.382 --> 38:57.351
To keep you occupied
while we searched your car.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.353
- You touch my car
without a warrant,

38:59.421 --> 39:01.322
And you will regret it,
I assure you.

39:01.389 --> 39:04.058
- Why? What are you gonna do--
call daddy?

39:04.125 --> 39:06.126
Huh?

39:06.194 --> 39:08.996
Here. He may, in fact, be
very interested in this.

39:09.063 --> 39:12.132
Come on in.
Thank you, jim.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.401
Mr. Grayson,
are you, uh, familiar

39:14.469 --> 39:17.004
With the mechanics
of door latches

39:17.072 --> 39:18.539
For various vehicles?

39:18.606 --> 39:20.007
- Enlighten me, please.

39:20.074 --> 39:22.242
- Well, each make
and model is unique.

39:22.310 --> 39:25.612
- Which makes
identification real easy.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.913
No two doorjambs are alike.

39:27.980 --> 39:30.446
- So let me understand this.

39:30.513 --> 39:33.414
You sandbagged me
with this circus act

39:33.482 --> 39:35.148
While you seized my car?

39:35.216 --> 39:38.216
- Uh-huh. We needed
to match the wound patterns

39:38.284 --> 39:39.983
From kevin's body
with your car door.

39:40.051 --> 39:42.048
- Well, since your stupidity

39:42.116 --> 39:44.048
Prevents you
from the realization

39:44.116 --> 39:45.883
Of your misguided actions,

39:45.950 --> 39:47.217
I'll explain.

39:47.285 --> 39:49.419
- Stupidity?
- Yeah.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.089
See, you had
no probable cause.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.390
Huh?

39:53.458 --> 39:57.460
So therefore your search
of my vehicle was illegal.

39:57.527 --> 40:00.629
Okay? You found the kid's
dna on my car door?

40:00.697 --> 40:04.766
So what? In the law, it's called
fruit of the poisoned tree.

40:04.834 --> 40:08.336
All evidence seized
during that search

40:08.403 --> 40:11.372
Is inadmissible.

40:11.439 --> 40:15.008
You just gave away
your entire case, detectives.

40:15.076 --> 40:17.512
- It's interesting
that you just talked

40:17.579 --> 40:20.215
About kevin getting hit
with a car door.

40:20.282 --> 40:22.351
David didn't know that.

40:22.419 --> 40:24.654
In effect,
what you've just told us

40:24.722 --> 40:27.691
Is that at the moment
that kevin was killed,

40:27.759 --> 40:29.594
David wasn't there.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.929
- As for your car,
it's right where you left it.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.198
A dealership on 41st street
lent us this.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.867
[clattering]
they were very helpful.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.070
- It's not your car.

40:39.138 --> 40:41.439
And you're right.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.874
We do need probable cause...

40:43.942 --> 40:45.710
To check your gps

40:45.777 --> 40:49.213
And the real car door
with the actual dna.

40:49.281 --> 40:52.549
But luckily, what you said...

40:52.617 --> 40:55.653
Just gave that to us.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.255
- After all I did...

40:58.323 --> 41:02.292
You keep these pictures
to screw me!

41:03.728 --> 41:06.830
- I trusted you...

41:06.898 --> 41:08.065
But not enough.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.500
I had to have
my insurance too.

41:10.568 --> 41:11.968
[handcuffs clicking]

41:12.036 --> 41:13.337
- Nathan grayson,

41:13.404 --> 41:15.706
You're under arrest for
the murder of kevin denaburg.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.441
- [spits]

41:17.509 --> 41:19.009
- You have the right
to remain silent.

41:19.077 --> 41:21.012
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

41:21.079 --> 41:22.180
In a court of law.

41:22.248 --> 41:24.583
You have the right
to an attorney...

41:37.028 --> 41:38.828
- Accessory after the fact.

41:38.895 --> 41:42.097
With a plea,
david's looking at some time.

41:43.934 --> 41:45.868
- I think she'll wait.

41:45.935 --> 41:47.069
- David...

41:47.137 --> 41:49.171
- He'll have nothing
when he comes out.

41:49.239 --> 41:51.373
- He'll have a conscience.

41:51.441 --> 41:53.175
She values that.
