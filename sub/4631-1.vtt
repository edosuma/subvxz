We see this is not so.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.026
Holy shit!

05:53.228 --> 05:54.696

05:58.608 --> 06:00.610

Have you changed your plans

06:03.780 --> 06:05.748

06:23.717 --> 06:24.843
Some still.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.607
You will not get over it, you sit around for

beach house of my parents.

09:01.583 --> 09:02.129
Wow!

09:04.085 --> 09:05.337
Not bad, huh?

09:05.587 --> 09:09.683
No, it's not bad, old friend.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.104
Okay. Okay, that is biscuits

09:22.270 --> 09:25.023
Yes? Are you sure you do not

09:28.234 --> 09:31.283
Here you live, Bro.
Then make us comfortable.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.287
I have a lot planned for us.
Hopes ran, there is plenty to do.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.291
Ah, what's up, Jimmy?

09:58.890 --> 10:00.642

Hi, Kip.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.786
You know, you were not so '
Pussy ne, that could be your blowjob.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.455
Oh, that's it! Yes I know.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.673
As much as you are not used to.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.086
Use your hands.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.885
Yes, just as I like. Hardener!

10:32.090 --> 10:33.717
I would not do that,
if I was you.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.137
But you know what?
You are certain spheres.

10:37.887 --> 10:38.729
What ...!

10:40.181 --> 10:41.307
What was this?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.899
You're dreaming, man. Especially you left
terrible to you, Bro.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.530
You chased by demons, man.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.983
Let's talk about it.
What's going on up there?

10:51.025 --> 10:54.074
I think about shit,
I should not think.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.493
In mega depressive iPod,
what did you expect?

10:56.698 --> 10:59.247
I would,
or mold your thing.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.217
Now come.
I have to show you there.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.304
So tell me. How many times had
Allison and every month you have sex?

11:15.466 --> 11:16.809
What the hell has the
for meaning?

11:16.968 --> 11:18.470
Spencer, who may be new to you:

11:18.678 --> 11:20.305
throughout history all great thinkers -

11:20.471 --> 11:23.816
Einstein, Aristotle, Lothar Matthäus ...
Those damn idiots

11:23.975 --> 11:25.852
They come up all the time
break your heart.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.189
And as a result, they came up with the idea of ​​men
formula.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.320
So how many times a month?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.910
I do not know, I mean ...

11:34.444 --> 11:38.494
Often then became
the time a little less.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.081
You know, no idea
as an average of six ...

11:43.786 --> 11:44.332
Ok.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.541
Listen, man. It Was
more than just sex, right?

11:47.749 --> 11:50.548
I'm just a little sad.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.884
It was also about love.
You made virtually no idea.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.344
The word that I do not
hear in this house!

11:55.506 --> 11:56.849
What you're the Bachelor?

11:57.008 --> 11:59.306
Every time you
the word "love" in connection

11:59.469 --> 12:01.437
used with a woman,
you are making a dollar on the jar.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.230
- That's a rule.
- Ok.

12:03.348 --> 12:08.320
Okay, that was six times a month. Three
years carry 1, divided by Pi ...

12:08.478 --> 12:12.028
- Transmits was not the first.
-... It is equal to 25 fucked 25 times?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.237
Let's get right to the point.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.406
It is said that half
time needs a relationship

12:15.568 --> 12:18.071
to completely about
overcome. - Real?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.161
Thus, based on the formula of men

12:20.281 --> 12:21.954
- 25 divided by 2 - you have to ...

12:22.116 --> 12:24.539
- Your account is not the same ...
- Birds ... 12.5 brides!

12:24.744 --> 12:25.870
For Allison oblivion.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.121
- Yes ...
- You know teenagers?

12:27.288 --> 12:28.540
I do not know if this works well.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.466
It works.
That's why they call Pi

12:30.625 --> 12:32.002
You invent everything alone, right?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.841
Forget it. We round up, ok?

12:34.003 --> 12:35.971
Forget the little people.
We just say 13

12:36.297 --> 12:37.298
I do not know what to say.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.138
And because I was a terrible friend
,

12:39.259 --> 12:40.681
if I leave him alone,

12:42.178 --> 12:44.601
... I decided,
the way to go along with you.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.025
Oh, the We-fuck-a-fat-Friday!

12:47.141 --> 12:49.235
Fats to Friday We-fuck-a-.
My personal favorite.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.025
This is really good!

12:51.437 --> 12:53.656
- Correct artistically.
<I> - That's not the pussy, fool </ i>

12:53.856 --> 12:55.028
beautiful colors.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.572
Great. You are about.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.245
No, no chance.
I can not do it.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.532
I've driven with neighbor
when you were in bed.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.826
So I'm going to give me cross
'S.

13:04.575 --> 13:05.201
How are you.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.545
If you think that just because you make me
all written any competition,

13:07.704 --> 13:09.126
move to rumzuvögeln, so ...

13:09.998 --> 13:12.717
Put on your suit. Let me show you what we have to do it for you
.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.010
Yes, I have beaten you.

13:36.441 --> 13:39.160
Okay, I'll break it down for you
times.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.414
Before you is a pool full of talent.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.707
- Hey, Coca-Cola.
- Hey, how are you Veronica?

13:44.991 --> 13:46.163
Late tonight?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.584
So anyone who is
no one is here.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.294
And every day to flirt.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.632

I have so much to
on, Spence.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.639
My best bugger fighters
the night before the fight?

29:25.847 --> 29:27.975
- I do not irritate, I ...
- Do not apologize dear to me.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.394
I do not want to apologize
.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.187
Yes, yes, yes, you are doing

29:32.312 --> 29:34.064
Yes, he wants to apologize to you.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.706
- Good to see you, man.
- My God! Hey, Brother.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.417
Damn! You feel it?

29:45.826 --> 29:48.204
You feel it? This is the intensity,
I spoke of.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.377
Since it with the bride, he was gone.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.258
Kips girlfriend?
Hey, it's true, Spence?

29:53.792 --> 29:56.011
- You stopped because of it?
- Say, that's not true, man.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.422
- Oh, right.
- Thank Coke.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.682
- No problem.
- Forget the guy, man.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.931
If anyone tries to you,
you kick the salt of his balls.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.054
Just forget it.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.347
Glad you're back.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.526
Thanks, but I'm not back,
Coach, I'm just here.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.399
I do not know why we are here
.

30:13.562 --> 30:16.941
We are here because their eggs always
still hanging around your vagina.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.700
Maybe it's time someone goes there and
rausholt it.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.251
I may have said too much
only now.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.465
Oh, really, asshole?
I'm almost dead

30:33.582 --> 30:36.552
Now you are there! You have to move and shake it
! Come on, get up!

30:36.710 --> 30:37.586
You wiser drilling.

30:37.753 --> 30:41.053

30:43.717 --> 30:44.969
Oh God, you're a fucking friend!

If you "shit" with
large middle, then yes.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.229
How are you. Stay tuned, stay tuned!

30:55.520 --> 30:56.567

31:01.026 --> 31:03.154

31:05.989 --> 31:09.209
Come on, pussy.
You want it too!

31:11.328 --> 31:12.580
Yeah! This was evident!

31:16.249 --> 31:18.468
- This could be your blowjob!
- It's over, Spence.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.346
- I am now Kip.

- Yes honey.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.972
I'll call the White Stallion

How are they going. Well, Spence.

31:37.479 --> 31:38.947

Super!

31:56.790 --> 31:57.541
Time!

31:58.667 --> 32:02.012
I wanted to see Spence.
You just have to pull the trigger.

32:02.212 --> 32:05.432
You have the power. Even if you
do not, your opponent will.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.432
I'm through genuine.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.343
By the way, your office is the same.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.054
I knew you back.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.810
- This is not me, Coach.
- Right, right, right.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.811
Good work with the Under hooks.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.768
Because the boxes will bring you
nothing when you are lying on your ass.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.396
- Thanks man.
- Hey, anytime.

32:20.021 --> 32:23.616
But now you have to leave here, otherwise
I'm late for my manicure.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.532
- I have to go.
- The widths are more sensitive.

32:27.863 --> 32:30.161
You totally fucked us.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.873
Every masturbation has a shit
done to your cardio.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.038
We need to move us.

32:37.247 --> 32:37.998
Baby!

32:40.625 --> 32:41.842
Hey, Spencer.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.267

32:57.476 --> 32:59.319
Life is good, my friend.
Life is good.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.279
I sleep anyway
no other.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.818
So it does not matter.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.285
Oh, Deidre, what are you doing here
out there? Come on baby.

33:07.777 --> 33:08.994
Why do not you come?

33:09.362 --> 33:10.363
Take a look at yourself.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.163
Hey, baby!

33:19.539 --> 33:20.836
I would have liked 'n drink.

33:22.042 --> 33:23.339
Fri on the Beach.

33:24.419 --> 33:28.890
So I really wanted you
ask if the two of us something ...

33:30.008 --> 33:32.010

33:32.260 --> 33:32.852
Hey.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.936
What's going on here, man?

33:37.140 --> 33:39.768
Man wants but with these girls
no relationship.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.654
Just because you're anti-girlfriend,
for which there is no reason.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.610
What? Listen! With No Reason?

33:44.773 --> 33:47.572
Let me help you,
to understand it, right?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.236
Look at you here once good order.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.279
You wear high heels,
to appear larger.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.490
Bras push-up,
have more chest.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.243
The sweetness carries seven kilos of makeup.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.755
Use tanning, colored contact lenses
, Are full of Botox ...

34:00.080 --> 34:02.833
I even met one,
which had calf implants.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.210
It's all 'a show, man.

34:05.418 --> 34:09.342
These girls lying to yourself because
you think they not lie to you.?

34:11.925 --> 34:14.553
Looking here without girlfriend, man.
You look at 'their good time.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.393
It's nearly eleven.
Here it is equal to gross.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.109
Ok.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.562
Game Time!

34:52.465 --> 34:54.513
- Hey, Spencer.
- Hey, hi! Nen "buttery nipple" War '

34:55.844 --> 34:57.437
?

35:03.727 --> 35:04.979
Oh, Spencer!

35:06.896 --> 35:08.398
Maybe later, baby.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.834
I have to wait for Coca-Cola.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.625
Ok, so I'll ...

35:27.292 --> 35:28.635
Let's go out.

35:29.377 --> 35:30.799
Oh my gosh!

35:31.004 --> 35:33.302
I can not believe.
Every time she does it.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.809
It is a few drinks
and in no time she is "Wunderhure".

35:36.384 --> 35:38.603
- Only without the robe of course.
- Of course!

35:38.720 --> 35:41.269
- With cover, it would be too obvious.
- Yes.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.816
A giant "W".

35:45.060 --> 35:47.859
Then you kiss any kind
at the bar? - Not my style.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.405
- Seriously?
- Really.

35:49.689 --> 35:52.568
Even when a sweet guy like you want to kiss me
.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.367
- Do not worry. Madisyn?
- Yes.

35:56.863 --> 35:58.160
Do not worry, you're safe.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.334
It's not like I do not like
,

36:01.493 --> 36:03.541
but a girl needs
some basic rules.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.037
I know.

36:04.245 --> 36:06.247
First, it is just a kiss
at the bar, but at no time ...

36:06.665 --> 36:08.042
... Boquete in the bathroom.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.669
I was in love.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.346
In her breasts.

36:15.298 --> 36:15.969
Coke!

36:16.424 --> 36:17.641
No no no! Coca!

36:18.843 --> 36:20.516
And as I go home now?

36:23.014 --> 36:25.688
Well, if you like,
I can take it.

36:29.104 --> 36:32.278
Oh man! I can not believe.
He's like a machine.

36:32.399 --> 36:35.198
It's so embarrassing. Wait, where ...

36:35.777 --> 36:36.949
Where are we?

36:37.612 --> 36:38.659
For me.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.741
Relax. I just want something to drink.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.461
- No big deal.
- Please Madisyn ...

36:45.286 --> 36:48.130
You seem like a very sweet girl
,

36:48.331 --> 36:51.835
But my head is something crazy
at the time, okay?

36:52.001 --> 36:55.471
Trust me. You do not want to waste your time with me
.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.257
Okay, good to know.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.886
But I am three months
home and I did not invite anyone to 'n drink.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.393
So do not be rude.
But you should not expect anything!

37:05.390 --> 37:06.266
Come on!

37:10.770 --> 37:14.695
You do gymnastics! I was in
Boxteam during high school.

37:18.528 --> 37:21.247
Madisyn! No, seriously now!

37:22.782 --> 37:25.410
I'm so sorry. But I can not.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.709
Sorry. I can not.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.133
You can not go,
before you took.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.044
Wait, Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola! Damn, Coca-Cola!

37:35.253 --> 37:36.300
If for your own good, Spence.

37:36.463 --> 37:37.305
Why are you doing this?

37:37.464 --> 37:40.013
I'll make sure to stay on set.
So get your husband!

37:40.759 --> 37:41.681
Come on!

37:43.553 --> 37:44.805
- Madisyn ...
- Sit down.

37:45.472 --> 37:49.067
Listen, we really need to do anything
, Okay? We can only talk.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.479
- So, you were heartbroken?
- Yes.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.771
What happened?

37:56.441 --> 37:58.944
Well, she was my everything.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.535
If you love someone,
then so be it, right?

38:03.782 --> 38:08.003
And if someone unconditionally
open the soul, if someone loves you.

38:09.078 --> 38:12.878
And because she asked me to stop boxing and MMA
I did it.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.092
It's really brutal ...

38:15.335 --> 38:18.714
Of course I loved it, but unfortunately
I loved her more.

38:20.423 --> 38:24.223
Leave something for them,
He made me happy.

38:26.679 --> 38:30.434
I stopped the fight, right in front of my

38:30.600 --> 38:33.604
professional debut,
like an idiot, and ...

38:34.187 --> 38:37.157
... Simpleton butt against
I should fight, Kip ...

38:37.982 --> 38:41.577
Man, I can not since
more out of my head.

38:43.071 --> 38:48.328
This woman torn me and so
quite destroyed everything I had, so ...

38:49.577 --> 38:51.955
And because I found myself,
Kip was the only

38:52.121 --> 38:56.718
with whom she had cheated on me several times
I broke.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.054
- You talk too much.
- Oh no!

38:59.212 --> 39:02.762
- No, no, no, Madisyn.
- Yes. Do not worry. I'm old enough.

39:04.092 --> 39:04.968
Or not?

39:05.134 --> 39:08.058
Madisyn, that's not what I wanted!
I just wanted to talk, okay?

39:08.221 --> 39:11.191
I will not betray!
I will not betray!

39:11.391 --> 39:12.517
Do you like my room?

39:12.642 --> 39:16.522
Look, my dolls!
I love toy stores.

39:16.896 --> 39:17.738
Coke!

39:21.025 --> 39:21.901
Oh yeah!

39:25.154 --> 39:29.455
Come on, Spence. This is
but what you want, or not?

39:30.785 --> 39:32.583
Show me what I'm missing.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.005
I miss you so much.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.701
Oh my gosh!

40:05.194 --> 40:07.117
How are you. So we're in time.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.208
I just pushed it.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.551
Are you sure you want to do this without
Breakfast?

40:21.586 --> 40:24.260
There is still time to spare,
if you would still embrace.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.924
What came over me?

40:27.216 --> 40:30.641
I never thought I would ever say
But ...

40:31.095 --> 40:32.893
I think I have the
really necessary.

40:33.097 --> 40:36.442
So from now on, it's all or nothing
, Okay?

40:36.809 --> 40:37.355
Right.

40:37.685 --> 40:42.111
In some sick way
you really are a good friend.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.908
Then, if strap-on time.

40:44.067 --> 40:46.661
Because there is much more sick shit
where that came from.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.208
Stretch and stretch!

40:57.330 --> 40:58.502
What the ...?

41:23.690 --> 41:24.737
How it should look.

41:44.961 --> 41:48.431
Julie, baby. A Kamikaze
It comes toward you.

42:09.736 --> 42:10.737
Hey, girls!

42:34.635 --> 42:36.057
Cosmo to Courtney.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.994
Yes, as hard as I fuck with Kip!
Look at me!

42:51.736 --> 42:52.328
Do Not!

42:56.783 --> 42:58.660
Maria Martini.

43:13.883 --> 43:15.510
So, you want my number now?

43:17.178 --> 43:18.100
Call me.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.061
No, I'm serious.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.672
- Do you like it?
- Shit, yeah!

44:39.927 --> 44:42.180
Coca-Cola, you are. You are at home?

44:46.517 --> 44:47.234
Morning.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.606
What is this?

44:52.231 --> 44:54.609
I do not know how you like it,
but he is black and hot.

44:56.611 --> 44:57.203
What?

44:57.403 --> 44:58.950
Nothing. Thanks.

44:59.822 --> 45:00.994
Very cool of you.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.370
It is weird. I'm funny?
This is funny?

45:06.162 --> 45:10.087
No, I do not think. Why?
I'm weird? - Yes!

45:10.208 --> 45:11.425
A little.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.586
There is definitely something
Funny toward him.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.838
I'm Katie. By the way.

45:16.005 --> 45:18.508
- I'm so sorry. Spencer.
- I remember.

45:22.929 --> 45:23.350
So ...

45:23.512 --> 45:27.062
you're just here for the summer,
or are you living here?

45:27.225 --> 45:29.068
No, I do not live here.
Only during the summer.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.025
- Or what's left of it yet.
- Yes!

45:31.145 --> 45:32.146
I know. True.

45:32.271 --> 45:35.320
Just stay warm and
summer is already almost over!

45:36.776 --> 45:39.404
- YES crass crass.
- My God! Total crass crass!

45:40.738 --> 45:43.036
I really listened to
He said recently 'n girls.

45:43.199 --> 45:45.748
With a straight face.
It really was an unqualified success.

45:47.662 --> 45:48.754
This is full crass.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:39.992

You met your mouth?

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.336
What have you done to me?

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:56.504
Ok? And how can I get rid of it again

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.143
What do you feel?

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.262
What's so funny?
This is not funny.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.561

Maybe you think
but seriously this time of Ally.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.405
Maybe she finally
found out what she wants.

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:10.406
Ah, if Ally is serious,
it is near.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.788

So I do not understand. You should only
sit and wait until Katie calls you?

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.472
Why?

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:39.310
Do not trust me. She thinks
I am a club face. - That's what you

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:41.479

You seem a little nervous.
You sure you're okay?

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:48.381
If you want to do this ...

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:51.465
- We should not rush things.
- No, I'm sorry, Spencer.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.796
It's hard to explain.

01:08:54.005 --> 01:08:56.428
Ok, you do not need.
Let's have fun.

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.685

I go to sleep in no case
with you.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.649
Good, because I'm going to sleep in
not counting on you.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.529
You know, in ancient Greece was playing

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.368
An apple regarded as a marriage proposal
.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.782
Ok, I know you think you want to enlighten me

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:22.700
about the world outside of life
Club. But I was wrong!

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.171
Take that!

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.053
Only dinner and
a pleasant conversation.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:45.098

Okay, so what do you think
surprises ready for me?

Another unexpected gift.
Honesty.

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.535
On the other hand, if I wanted to know all its dark secrets
,

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.617
I just want to do it again
sleep with you, right?

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:03.663
- Why are you talking about when you are sleeping.
- Oh my God!

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.248
This is really embarrassing.

- Okay, I have one thing, yes?
- Okay, please. Willing.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:12.584
Have you heard of
"Mixed martial arts"?

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.382
You mean these Octagon attacks
bloody?

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.091
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:17.638
I was in competitions.

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:20.929
And I stopped training,
the wrong reasons.

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:25.222
But I retrain
and I do not intend to stop.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:29.150
Wow. Okay.
I did not expect.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.227
Yeah, I figure.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:37.234
No, I mean, yes, it has been well
"Conan the Barbarian" to me, but it's cool.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.076
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:44.161
Also, since you'll probably need a lot
Dentures one days

01:10:44.365 --> 01:10:47.084
and I do not want to miss the chance to win a customer
.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.333
I do not like it, because now I feel exploited
.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.122
When everything is just about money.
That was not ...

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:53.833
What can you, I can do better.
You 'nen Apple shot me!

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.585
That means I like you.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.254
We are not in
the second class.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.592
Kindergarten, okay?

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.259
Let's take things now?

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.187
I should go.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.444
You know what?
This is a great idea.

01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:15.278
Ladies First.

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:29.290

So what are you doing now?

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:36.919
I do not know. My back hurts
cooking.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:40.304
So I jump in
probably the Jacuzzi, and that's it.

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:43.716
But I do not have swimwear.

At the risk of sounding like a hopeless romantic
:

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:05.259
There's a girl outside.
Just for you, man. I know that.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.640
Only for you. In Order? One of them, ...

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:10.388

- Yes? She is hot?

But this way will not find them
you.

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:28.201
Yes Yes. You're right.

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:29.820
You're right.

And I can not believe,
I say this,

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.458
but from now and here

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:35.993
I'll hang it on a nail.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.044
Officially will zurückschwänzeln.

I promise myself that I will never

01:22:55.846 --> 01:22:57.223
Except for love.

01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:00.688
That's it.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.737
- And for porn.
- Oh my God.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:05.239

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.691
- Let's start.
- Oh, Coca-Cola.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:14.497
Come On!

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:16.996
I think you're kidding me.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:18.376
Moment short waiting time.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.246
You want to drop the charges,

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.211
when my friend Coke
purely depends on something here?

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.796
I hear he has a fire hose
,

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.379
deletes a fiery hell at me.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:31.511
And I still was not
flattened this Millennium.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:37.221
Sister, with all due respect ...

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.306

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:41.942
But with ... Believe me ...

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:44.611
Sister, you do not need makeup.
Do you have total loss.

01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:48.024
You know their wives

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:48.907
I do this.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:50.571
Coke, no! Not after
his promise.

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.532
Fuck. You can not run away from your true self

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:54.371
I will not let
you make it.

01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.532

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.083

But she hates me.

01:27:47.345 --> 01:27:50.349
But you are a hopeless romantic
.

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:53.439
You'll have to do.

You're right.

Katie was right. Finally
