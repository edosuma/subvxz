00:42.861 --> 00:46.061
- All right,
let's come right this way.

00:46.093 --> 00:47.629
Here we go.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.365
All right.

00:52.397 --> 00:53.260
Be right back with coffee.

00:53.293 --> 00:54.573
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:59.596 --> 01:01.389
- Stop kicking me now!

01:01.421 --> 01:02.285
- Please.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.117
- It's breakfast!

01:07.149 --> 01:08.076
- Look, they
don't have french fries.

01:08.108 --> 01:09.996
We talked about this in the car.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.403
It's breakfast.

01:11.435 --> 01:13.131
I don't think they have
them until lunch, honey.

01:13.163 --> 01:14.347
You're just gonna have to deal.

01:14.379 --> 01:15.532
I'm sorry.

01:15.564 --> 01:17.003
- Then I want a
donut, I want a donut.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.923
- I don't think
they have donuts, either.

01:21.324 --> 01:22.572
We'll figure it out.

01:22.604 --> 01:25.356
- Yeah.
- You can have eggs, bagels.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.164
Juice.

01:29.196 --> 01:31.467
What do you want?
- I want orange juice!

01:31.499 --> 01:32.844
- I want pancakes!

01:32.876 --> 01:34.315
- Okay, that we can do.

01:34.347 --> 01:35.435
- Not hungry?

01:35.467 --> 01:36.940
- Not like french fries.

01:37.868 --> 01:39.724
- How far is the train station?

01:39.756 --> 01:40.907
- About a half hour walk.

01:45.100 --> 01:45.867
No rush.

01:47.052 --> 01:49.771
Okay, you guys can
do some coloring.

01:50.635 --> 01:52.332
I'll be back with coffee.

01:52.364 --> 01:53.996
thank you.

01:55.435 --> 01:57.900
All right, I need the two
of you to check, all right.

01:57.932 --> 01:59.660
If you kick her under
the table again,

01:59.692 --> 02:00.620
we're gonna have.

02:00.652 --> 02:02.572
- Josh, stop it!

02:03.660 --> 02:04.460
It hurts.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.587
Look, now I have just done the
worst coloring in the world.

- This
just came across my desk.

03:17.546 --> 03:19.210
In local news, an investigation

03:19.242 --> 03:21.130
is underway after
a Richmond woman

03:21.162 --> 03:23.242
was found dead in her
home early this morning.

03:23.274 --> 03:25.066
Lincoln County
investigators confirm

03:25.098 --> 03:26.922
that signs of a
struggle were evident,

03:26.954 --> 03:29.481
and this case will be
treated as a homicide.

03:29.513 --> 03:30.826
Motive has yet to be determined.

03:30.858 --> 03:32.425
However, there were no signs

03:32.457 --> 03:33.898
of a forced.

03:33.930 --> 03:37.482
- I'm out here job hunting
and not having much luck.

03:37.514 --> 03:38.922
- Oh, where
are you applying?

03:38.953 --> 03:41.097
- I hit up all these
stores really except-

03:41.130 --> 03:42.762
- There's
a lot of stores.

03:42.793 --> 03:43.945
- Yeah.

03:43.977 --> 03:45.066
Do you got, I'm sorry, I don't.

03:45.098 --> 03:45.865
- Do you need a light?
- Yeah, thank you.

03:49.002 --> 03:50.473
They're not hiring
here, are they?

03:50.505 --> 03:53.066
- Well, I was gonna say
I wouldn't, you know.

03:54.154 --> 03:55.594
- Really, not a good place?

03:59.049 --> 04:00.041
- I only work here
because I'm trying

04:00.072 --> 04:01.577
to save up to go to school.

04:02.697 --> 04:04.169
It's just like absolute.

04:04.201 --> 04:05.129
- Yeah.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.920
Can I fucking help you?

04:06.952 --> 04:08.521
- What, are you
out here begging for change?

04:09.481 --> 04:10.857
- Ah, hell no!

04:12.041 --> 04:13.544
Have a nice day.

04:13.576 --> 04:15.592
- Whoa,
whoa, I just got here!

04:15.624 --> 04:16.713
Where you going?

04:17.769 --> 04:19.209
- How'd you fucking
find me, man?

04:20.105 --> 04:21.737
- Little birdy named Rick.

04:22.921 --> 04:23.785
Come on, Ry-guy,
you know I still got

04:23.817 --> 04:24.393
connections at Two Way Street.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.457
Hey, it's been too
long, little brother.

04:28.489 --> 04:29.832
- Yeah, whose fault is that?

04:34.185 --> 04:38.761
- Hey, remember that place
up north in the sticks

04:38.793 --> 04:40.585
Mom used to take us to?

04:40.617 --> 04:42.761
You know, up in the country
there, we used to go camping.

04:42.793 --> 04:44.360
Remember that?

04:44.392 --> 04:45.673
Those were good times, brother.

04:45.705 --> 04:46.729
Real good times.

04:47.881 --> 04:49.609
Simple living back
then, too, right?

04:49.641 --> 04:50.665
- Yes, it was.

04:53.353 --> 04:55.879
You know, I moved up there
after you got locked up.

04:55.911 --> 04:58.248
Had a nice little
construction job.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.264
This old guy Teddy, man.

05:00.296 --> 05:03.912
A good thing going,
too, for a few, anyway.

05:03.944 --> 05:04.872
- Well, come on, let's go.

05:04.904 --> 05:06.152
I'll give you a ride.

05:06.184 --> 05:07.080
- To New Hampshire?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.608
Yeah, right.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.368
Sweet minivan,
though, soccer mom.

05:12.264 --> 05:13.928
- Fuck off, man.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.792
It's Crystal's.

05:15.688 --> 05:16.488
- Ah.

05:17.352 --> 05:18.184
- I'm serious.

05:18.984 --> 05:19.783
Come on in, man.

05:21.192 --> 05:24.520
You know, give us a chance
to make up for lost time.

05:25.704 --> 05:26.567
Who knows, maybe
we get up there,

05:26.599 --> 05:30.248
and we find work for both of us?

05:31.271 --> 05:32.040
You never know.

05:32.072 --> 05:33.480
- No, man.

05:33.512 --> 05:38.152
- You afraid of Case Manager
Ricky finding out, is that it?

05:39.400 --> 05:40.967
After all that guy's
done for you, right?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.823
- You sound just
like that bitch.

05:42.855 --> 05:44.456
- You know as well as I do,

05:45.703 --> 05:46.984
fucking Two Way Street
ain't no different

05:47.016 --> 05:48.808

05:50.024 --> 05:50.824
Come on, man.

05:52.519 --> 05:53.639
I owe you one.

06:04.807 --> 06:06.631
- Oh, lookie what we got here.

06:17.479 --> 06:19.207
You making little home movies?

06:23.047 --> 06:25.159
Wait a minute, who the
fuck are these people?

06:26.695 --> 06:28.391
Thought you said
this was Crystal's.

06:33.383 --> 06:35.271
You fucking stole this!

06:35.303 --> 06:36.775
- About an hour
before I ran into you.

06:36.807 --> 06:38.183
- Goddamn, man!

06:39.559 --> 06:40.871
You know I'm trying to
step away from this life!

06:40.903 --> 06:41.671
- Yeah, me, too.

06:41.703 --> 06:42.727
- Fuck that!

06:42.759 --> 06:43.783
You can let me out right here.

06:43.815 --> 06:45.063
Pull over.

06:45.095 --> 06:46.887
- Come on now.
- Nah, fucking pull over!

06:46.919 --> 06:48.678
- Just calm down, will ya?

06:48.710 --> 06:49.702
Hear me out.

06:49.734 --> 06:51.238
Hear you out, what?

06:51.270 --> 06:53.030
- Crystal broke
up with me, okay?

06:53.062 --> 06:54.310
- Oh, come on.

06:54.342 --> 06:56.678
- No, seriously, man,
she broke up with me.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.406
Just help me out, okay?

06:58.438 --> 07:01.574
After that, clean
slate, all right?

07:01.606 --> 07:03.142
I'm trying to start over new.

07:03.174 --> 07:04.934
I'm trying to be a new
person here, all right?

07:04.966 --> 07:06.886
- Oh, off to a great start.

07:06.918 --> 07:09.254
- I'm not pulling you
back in, Ryan, okay?

07:09.286 --> 07:12.326
This is just to get
us up there, right?

07:12.358 --> 07:15.622
And then honest living,
honest living, man.

07:15.654 --> 07:16.454
Trust me.

07:23.142 --> 07:25.286
- I need a fucking smoke.

07:27.206 --> 07:28.454
All right.

07:29.894 --> 07:32.134
Hey, that's it,
though, you hear me?

07:32.166 --> 07:33.574
Fuck this shit.

07:33.606 --> 07:36.294
Fuck Rick, fuck

08:00.837 --> 08:02.565
it's like something in
me changes, you know?

08:02.597 --> 08:04.709
- That's a scientific theory.

08:04.741 --> 08:07.717
It's habitat selection theory.

08:07.749 --> 08:08.709
- Oh, really?

08:08.741 --> 08:09.541
- Yeah.

08:10.981 --> 08:12.197
No, seriously, it's this thing.

08:12.229 --> 08:16.005
It was on NPR, and
they looked at animals

08:16.037 --> 08:17.765
that grew up in a
zoo versus animals

08:17.797 --> 08:21.413
that grew up in the wild,
and the animals in the wild,

08:21.445 --> 08:22.757
they had better
social functioning,

08:22.789 --> 08:24.613
better psychological
functioning,

08:24.645 --> 08:27.621
better physical
health, and it was just

08:27.653 --> 08:28.965
from being surrounded by nature,

08:28.997 --> 08:30.533
and it's the same thing with us.

08:58.692 --> 08:59.748
- Oh, no way.

09:01.028 --> 09:01.892
No way!

09:02.916 --> 09:04.292
- What, Ry?

09:04.325 --> 09:05.572
- Fuck!

09:05.604 --> 09:06.724
Look at this shit, man.

09:06.756 --> 09:07.972
Don't nobody stay here.

09:09.956 --> 09:11.012
What the fuck was I thinking?

09:19.428 --> 09:20.324
What are you doing?

09:26.884 --> 09:28.260
- Come on, man.

09:28.293 --> 09:31.076
Place looks like it's
closed for the season.

09:31.108 --> 09:31.972
Maybe for good.

09:33.956 --> 09:36.260
No one will even
know we're here.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.211
- Yeah?

09:38.243 --> 09:40.451
They will if you use
that fucking crowbar.

09:41.283 --> 09:42.147
- Come on, it'll be fun.

09:42.179 --> 09:43.331
Just check it out, you know?

09:43.363 --> 09:44.835
- Hold up.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.211
- Ah, Ry guy.

10:04.419 --> 10:06.019
- No fishing, remember?

10:06.051 --> 10:07.491
Clean slate, motherfucker.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.963
- All right.

10:08.995 --> 10:11.939
We'll put everything back
exactly how we found it.

10:11.971 --> 10:13.091
I promise.

10:13.123 --> 10:13.891
- Mm hmm.

10:46.370 --> 10:47.202
- Nice.

10:49.986 --> 10:50.754
- No.

10:50.787 --> 10:51.586
- Take your pick, man.

10:52.739 --> 10:53.538
- Nah, man.

10:54.498 --> 10:55.266
Nah, I'm cool.

10:55.298 --> 10:56.354
Put that shit back.

10:56.386 --> 10:57.186
- Yeah, okay.

10:58.082 --> 10:59.427
You say that now until you run

10:59.459 --> 11:02.114
into a fucking bear or
something out in the woods.

11:02.146 --> 11:03.682
I'd reconsider, my friend.

11:03.714 --> 11:05.826
- Are you scared of bears now?

11:05.858 --> 11:08.290
- There's all kinds of
shit in these woods, man.

11:08.322 --> 11:09.474
- Ain't like we're
staying here anyway,

11:09.506 --> 11:10.562
so who gives a shit?

11:10.594 --> 11:11.490
Come on, let's go.

11:14.114 --> 11:14.978
What are you doing?

11:16.739 --> 11:18.338
- What's the rush, man?

11:18.370 --> 11:19.138
- What?

11:24.994 --> 11:26.146
- Look at this place.

11:28.034 --> 11:29.954
We gotta find
somewhere to crash.

11:29.986 --> 11:31.139
This is great.

11:31.171 --> 11:33.090
- Wait, you wanna
like squat here?

11:34.209 --> 11:35.842
Are you fucking stupid?

11:35.874 --> 11:38.145
I came here for one reason
and one reason only,

11:39.265 --> 11:40.289
and now that shit
ain't happening,

11:40.321 --> 11:41.857
so why the fuck would I stay?

11:41.889 --> 11:43.937
- I ain't driving
back, Ry-guy, okay?

11:43.969 --> 11:46.017
It's two hours up
and two hours back.

11:46.049 --> 11:48.033
At least your
buddy Teddy owes us

11:48.065 --> 11:49.314
a good night's sleep, man.

11:50.402 --> 11:53.282
I'm just gonna lay
here and lay low, man,

11:53.314 --> 11:55.297
figure out our next move.

11:55.329 --> 11:56.130
Trust me.

12:08.001 --> 12:11.362
- I'm fucking starving,
and you're buying.

12:38.241 --> 12:40.289
- Hey, how ya doing?

12:44.480 --> 12:45.824
Do you guys sell cigarettes?

12:47.328 --> 12:48.544
- Yeah.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.672
- Oh, Jesus.

13:08.704 --> 13:09.921
Thank you.

13:09.953 --> 13:11.360
- You all set?

13:11.392 --> 13:15.104
- Yeah, I just need the one
pack, the lights, please.

13:19.425 --> 13:20.960
I'm no professional.

13:20.992 --> 13:23.072
I just like to have a
few when I'm on vacation.

13:25.951 --> 13:27.296
- All set?
- Yeah.

13:31.104 --> 13:33.503
Yeah, I think that'll do it.

13:33.535 --> 13:34.335
How much?

13:36.383 --> 13:37.632
- 27.50.

13:55.359 --> 13:56.832
Something I can help you with?

13:58.303 --> 13:59.103
- Just browsing.

14:00.736 --> 14:02.592
- Penny, out back.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.200
- She's nice.

14:16.863 --> 14:18.016
- Jesus.

14:18.048 --> 14:19.391
- Hey, how much is
all this shit, man?

14:19.423 --> 14:20.447
No prices anywhere.

14:34.271 --> 14:35.678
Is this fresh?

14:41.919 --> 14:43.582
Oh, I got them wasabi peas.

14:47.007 --> 14:48.735
You like them, right?

14:59.263 --> 15:01.726
- I'd check that if I
were you, my friend.

15:01.758 --> 15:04.510
- Why don't you
mind your business?

15:04.542 --> 15:05.758
- Show him.

15:05.790 --> 15:08.638
Then give him a one,
and you give him a 10.

15:13.631 --> 15:15.422
- Oh, shit, got him!

15:17.886 --> 15:18.941
- Thanks.

15:18.973 --> 15:21.246
You know, I didn't even notice.

15:26.525 --> 15:27.326
Thank you.

15:29.150 --> 15:30.493
Thanks again, appreciate it.

15:32.062 --> 15:33.629
- Hey, how much for
a pack of smokes?

15:41.981 --> 15:43.133
I want this one.

15:43.165 --> 15:44.765
- Whoa, no, no,
no, don't do that.

15:45.789 --> 15:47.198
- Oh, you're awake now, Pepe?

15:48.573 --> 15:49.789
How much?

15:49.821 --> 15:51.358
- 7.25.

15:52.445 --> 15:55.806
No, 7.75.

15:55.838 --> 15:57.854
- Prices just
magically went up, huh?

15:57.886 --> 15:58.750
- Like that.

15:58.782 --> 16:00.445
- That's the price.

16:00.477 --> 16:02.141
- Are you sure?

16:02.173 --> 16:04.382
Or are you just trying
to swindle us now, too?

16:06.430 --> 16:08.797
Give me two packs, the lights.

16:22.396 --> 16:23.196
- What?

16:33.405 --> 16:34.205
- 55.60.

16:35.069 --> 16:38.269
- 55?

16:38.301 --> 16:41.245
- If you don't like
it, you can leave.

16:44.476 --> 16:46.109
- Okay.
- It is what it is.

16:48.701 --> 16:49.949
- I got that, you pay.

16:55.164 --> 16:59.165
- Tell you what, Dick,
since you're just making up

16:59.197 --> 17:01.596
numbers, why don't we make
up a number of our own?

17:03.229 --> 17:05.309
This is what we're
gonna give you.

17:05.340 --> 17:06.684
- There you
go, buddy.

17:06.717 --> 17:08.380
Fucking old bastard.

17:10.909 --> 17:13.628
- Get the fuck out, get
out of my fucking store!

17:13.660 --> 17:14.971
- Gimme the bat.

17:15.003 --> 17:15.772
- You fucking crazy, old man?

17:15.804 --> 17:16.955
- Give it to me!

17:16.987 --> 17:17.979
- Get the
fuck out of here!

17:18.011 --> 17:19.131
- Get the fuck back!

17:20.668 --> 17:21.500
What are you doing?

17:21.532 --> 17:22.300
What are you?

17:22.332 --> 17:23.643
Get the fuck!

17:23.675 --> 17:25.116
Don't fucking do that.

17:27.388 --> 17:28.667
- Grandpa, what's going on?

17:29.884 --> 17:30.812
- Oh, shit.

17:30.844 --> 17:33.660
- Penny, go on out back, honey.

17:41.051 --> 17:42.332
- Come on over here.

17:42.364 --> 17:43.867
I gotta tell you something.

17:43.899 --> 17:46.044
- Leave her alone,
you son of a bitch.

17:46.076 --> 17:48.028
Penny, go out back now.

17:48.060 --> 17:50.747
- Come on, I just gotta
tell you something.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.220
Come on, it's a secret.

17:54.363 --> 17:55.259
- Hey, what the fuck?

17:55.291 --> 17:57.467
Come on, no, man, we gotta go!

17:57.499 --> 17:59.708
- Come on over here,
it's about your grandpa.

18:01.404 --> 18:05.660
Come on, come on, sit on
my lap, like Santa Claus.

18:06.939 --> 18:08.315
- What the
fuck are you doing?

18:09.531 --> 18:10.938
- Shut up.

18:13.435 --> 18:14.299
How old are you?

18:15.514 --> 18:16.315
- 15.

18:17.498 --> 18:19.514
- No way, 15?

18:24.090 --> 18:26.363
They didn't make 'em like
this when I was a kid.

18:27.194 --> 18:30.267
- Leave her alone, please.

18:30.299 --> 18:31.675
Just take your stuff and go.

18:33.243 --> 18:35.291
- I think you deserve
to hear something.

18:38.811 --> 18:39.610
Okay?

18:40.955 --> 18:43.899
Your grandpa is a
fucking con artist.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.282
He was just making
up random prices

18:48.314 --> 18:49.755
for everything we were buying,

18:52.699 --> 18:54.683
and we caught him.

18:54.715 --> 18:56.922
We called him out on it.

19:01.594 --> 19:05.593
And we told him, we're not
gonna stand for your stuff.

19:10.329 --> 19:14.458
So he ran and he was gonna
call the police on us!

19:16.921 --> 19:19.226
Like we were robbing him.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.793
Can you believe it?

19:26.266 --> 19:29.754
That's when my brother got
angry, and he broke your phone.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.394
I'm not gonna hurt
you, Penny, okay?

19:45.146 --> 19:47.226
Or your piece of shit
grandfather over there.

19:50.010 --> 19:53.401
But I just wanted you to
know that he's the bad guy.

19:58.394 --> 19:59.161
Not us.

20:01.177 --> 20:04.121
And if I were you,
I'd tell my grandpa

20:06.361 --> 20:11.161
he needs to start running
an honest business, okay?

20:15.129 --> 20:15.897
Come here.

20:30.649 --> 20:32.569
Now get the fuck off me.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.232
- Okay, gun it.

21:17.911 --> 21:19.735
- Sean,
it's not gonna work.

21:19.767 --> 21:22.360
We need to put something
under the wheel for traction.

21:25.432 --> 21:27.447
- Okay, I'm gonna
take a walk up.

21:27.479 --> 21:28.760
I'm gonna see if my
uncle's got anything

21:28.792 --> 21:30.168
lying around that
might help us out.

21:30.200 --> 21:32.120
- Do you want me to do it?

21:32.152 --> 21:33.848
- No, no, I got this.

21:33.880 --> 21:34.744
- Okay.

21:34.776 --> 21:36.664
- I'll be right back.

22:00.407 --> 22:01.911
- What?

22:01.943 --> 22:04.663
- That's what I'd like to
know, what the fuck was that?

22:09.591 --> 22:11.638
- Just having a little fun, man.

22:29.559 --> 22:31.031
What do we have here?

23:37.878 --> 23:39.510
Car doesn't like
the mud, does it?

23:42.454 --> 23:43.254
- Not at all.

23:47.542 --> 23:49.429
- Can we give you a push?

23:49.461 --> 23:51.221
- No, thank you, but,
honestly, I'm fine.

23:51.253 --> 23:52.725
My husband-
- No, it's not a problem

23:52.757 --> 23:53.973
at all.

23:54.005 --> 23:55.413
Two guys are better than one.

23:56.757 --> 23:59.381
Or none in this case 'cause
your husband isn't here.

23:59.413 --> 24:00.853
- Well, he should be right back,

24:00.885 --> 24:03.349
so it's no problem really.

24:04.821 --> 24:06.773
Okay, you guys really don't
have to do this right now.

24:06.805 --> 24:08.853
- Hey, puppy, that's
a good doggie.

24:11.253 --> 24:12.437
What kind is he?

24:12.469 --> 24:14.485
- It's a girl, and
her name is Danny.

24:14.517 --> 24:16.309
She's just a mutt.

24:16.342 --> 24:17.589
- Nothing wrong with that.

24:19.573 --> 24:20.821
- Come on, man, let's go.

24:24.565 --> 24:25.429
- Okay, you ready?

24:26.805 --> 24:30.229
Okay, we're gonna start
rocking it back and forth,

24:30.261 --> 24:32.213
and then when we get her going,

24:32.245 --> 24:35.093
give it a little gas, but
not too much, all right?

24:36.309 --> 24:37.077
Be gentle.

24:50.676 --> 24:52.019
- Cool, you guys get it out?

24:52.052 --> 24:53.652
- Hey, honey, yeah, these
guys were driving up

24:53.684 --> 24:56.084
and were nice enough
to stop and help.

24:56.116 --> 24:58.452
- The fuck you
gonna do with those?

24:58.484 --> 24:59.732
- You know, that is a
really great question,

24:59.764 --> 25:02.036
and it's not one I have
an answer to right now.

25:03.604 --> 25:06.100
Ro, I just met these
guys over at Dick's.

25:06.132 --> 25:07.028
- Oh, seriously?

25:08.244 --> 25:09.620
- Yeah, your man
here was gonna let

25:09.652 --> 25:12.308
that old bastard at the
store steal all your money.

25:12.340 --> 25:13.844
- What?

25:13.876 --> 25:16.180
- Yeah, Dick shortchanged me.

25:16.212 --> 25:18.356
I didn't notice, but this
guy, he called him out on it.

25:18.388 --> 25:19.348
It was awesome.

25:21.108 --> 25:22.420
- Got a cigarette?

25:22.452 --> 25:24.116
- Oh, yeah.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.836
You know what, I think
I'm going to join you.

25:26.868 --> 25:27.668
You don't mind, right?

25:29.076 --> 25:30.644
- You got a light?

25:30.676 --> 25:32.020
- Oh, shit, yeah.

25:32.852 --> 25:34.228
Somewhere, I got it.

25:35.348 --> 25:36.244
Here we go.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.099
I'm Sean, by the way.

25:38.132 --> 25:39.348
This is my wife Rosanna.

25:41.140 --> 25:45.939
I appreciate the help,
again.

25:47.283 --> 25:48.371
I should have you guys follow
me around everywhere I go.

25:51.251 --> 25:52.755
- That's my brother Rick.

25:52.787 --> 25:54.291
Ricky.

25:54.323 --> 25:55.124
I'm Dave.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.298
- You guys live around here?

25:58.163 --> 25:58.931
- No.

26:00.371 --> 26:02.611
- Are you visiting?

26:02.643 --> 26:04.243
- We got some friends up there.

26:04.275 --> 26:05.811
We're gonna do a little fishing.

26:05.843 --> 26:07.027
- Oh, Laurie and Reuben.

26:07.059 --> 26:09.107
They have a cabin
just up the road.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.315
- Nope, don't know 'em.

26:12.947 --> 26:15.571
- They ran a construction
business out of there.

26:16.563 --> 26:17.971
- Oh, really?

26:18.003 --> 26:19.891
- Well, yeah, they've
been close for a few years now,

26:19.923 --> 26:21.363
ever since the owner got sick.

26:23.251 --> 26:24.563
- Teddy?

26:24.595 --> 26:25.844
- Yeah, Teddy.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.243
My Uncle Brian,
whose cabin we're at,

26:28.275 --> 26:29.395
they were best friends.

26:29.427 --> 26:31.858
- So you know Teddy then?

26:31.891 --> 26:33.778
- You can recognize
him by his first name.

26:35.315 --> 26:38.450
We actually work for
Wickstrom Building.

26:40.082 --> 26:43.187
Well, I mean, that was
years ago, long time ago,

26:43.219 --> 26:45.586
but I mean, so we came up here,

26:45.618 --> 26:48.050
we're gonna do a little
pro bono work on the cabin.

26:49.106 --> 26:52.850
You know, help the
family out a little bit.

26:52.882 --> 26:54.354
We know what they
been going through,

26:54.386 --> 26:56.306
and it must be tough
for them, you know.

26:57.202 --> 26:58.290
- That's sweet of you guys.

26:58.322 --> 26:59.346
- That's really nice.

27:00.499 --> 27:03.698
- Yeah, you know, Ted
was really nice to me,

27:04.786 --> 27:06.578
and, you know, I'll
never forget it,

27:06.610 --> 27:10.578
and just felt like
the right thing to do.

27:14.322 --> 27:16.306
And, of course, I wanna
take this guy fishing.

27:17.426 --> 27:20.082
- Yep, fishing, it's
the fucking best.

27:22.354 --> 27:24.274
- Yeah, I haven't
been fishing in years.

27:26.610 --> 27:28.402
- Well, thanks so
much, you guys.

27:28.434 --> 27:30.354
It was really nice to meet you.

27:30.386 --> 27:31.155
- Yeah, I mean, thanks again.

27:31.187 --> 27:32.626
Can't thank you enough.

27:32.658 --> 27:34.130
And we're just up the
hill on Respite Road,

27:34.162 --> 27:36.273
so anything you
guys need, you know,

27:36.305 --> 27:37.649
anything at all, you know.

27:38.481 --> 27:39.409
Stop by for a beer.

27:42.129 --> 27:42.993
- Nice to meet you.

27:58.577 --> 27:59.729
- I don't like that you talked

27:59.761 --> 28:01.329
to them people in the
first fucking place,

28:01.361 --> 28:02.641
but I think they bought it.

28:10.001 --> 28:12.145
- How about that girl, huh?

28:24.018 --> 28:25.233
- That was weird.

28:25.265 --> 28:27.249
Did Brian say Laurie
and Reuben would be

28:27.281 --> 28:28.337
out this weekend, too?

28:29.233 --> 28:30.801
- Yeah, they should be there

28:30.833 --> 28:32.944
cleaning out the rest
of Teddy's stuff.

28:57.072 --> 28:58.384
All right, come on, Danny girl.

28:59.313 --> 29:00.304
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh uh,

29:00.337 --> 29:02.608
I don't want her off the leash.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.209
- Come on,
she's not gonna go far.

29:04.241 --> 29:05.616
- Come on, babe.

29:05.648 --> 29:06.512
- You know, it's
her favorite spot.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.696
She gets to run around free.

29:07.728 --> 29:09.680
If we keep her inside
all day, that's torture.

29:10.672 --> 29:11.536
Hey, check it out.

29:13.552 --> 29:14.992
That's a trail cam.

29:15.024 --> 29:16.689
They're motion
sensored, so you know,

29:16.721 --> 29:18.800
you get a sense of the
wildlife in the area,

29:18.832 --> 29:20.497
see what comes around at night.

29:20.529 --> 29:21.648
- That's really cool.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.577
- Yeah.
- You think we can take

29:22.608 --> 29:23.695
it down and check it out?

29:25.712 --> 29:28.367
- Well, you know, we'd
have to take it inside

29:28.399 --> 29:29.935
and hook it up to a computer.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.407
It's the only way to really
go through the photos

29:31.439 --> 29:32.912
and see what's on there.

29:34.159 --> 29:36.207
- Never mind, it's okay.

29:36.239 --> 29:37.007
Come on.

29:39.023 --> 29:40.623
Let's go, good girl.

30:01.359 --> 30:03.696
- Shit, this is the life, huh?

30:11.694 --> 30:13.232
Use a goddamn coaster, please.

30:14.128 --> 30:14.927
- Huh?

30:16.719 --> 30:18.767
- Use a coaster.

30:18.799 --> 30:20.367
That's what they're there for.

30:20.399 --> 30:23.119
You don't wanna leave
rings on the table.

30:23.151 --> 30:26.318
- Okay, so this
Susie Homemaker shit

30:26.350 --> 30:28.174
is getting a little
fucking weird, Bob.

30:29.166 --> 30:30.542
- What, man?

30:30.575 --> 30:31.471
We're supposed to make it look

30:31.502 --> 30:32.527
like we're never here, remember?

30:32.559 --> 30:33.742
- Okay.

30:40.366 --> 30:41.135
Not bad, huh?

30:47.598 --> 30:49.966
How about that little
wifey down the road, huh?

30:57.742 --> 31:00.335
What do you think she's
doing with that guy?

31:00.367 --> 31:01.423
- I don't know.

31:01.455 --> 31:02.510
He must have
something you don't.

31:05.935 --> 31:07.694
- A
new hybrid of wild animal

31:07.726 --> 31:10.862
has found its way into some
of the more urban areas

31:10.895 --> 31:12.206
of North America.

31:13.583 --> 31:17.102
Appearing very wolf-like,
these stealthy predators

31:17.134 --> 31:20.271
have slipped unnoticed
into our cities.

31:21.327 --> 31:24.238
A medium-sized carnivore
howling among us

31:24.270 --> 31:25.998
is going to do very well.

31:45.390 --> 31:46.829
- We've
gotta get outta here.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.398
- We are,
we are getting out of here.

31:48.430 --> 31:50.158
We're going to the
cabin, you know?

31:51.214 --> 31:52.589
Yeah, but no, I mean,

31:52.621 --> 31:53.838
not a weekend, for good.

31:54.894 --> 31:55.693
- Yeah.

31:57.006 --> 31:57.806
You know...

32:00.814 --> 32:02.413
I am gonna tell him.

32:04.301 --> 32:06.286
Tomorrow, FYI.

32:06.318 --> 32:07.181
- Okay.

32:07.213 --> 32:09.005
- I'm gonna walk right in there

32:09.037 --> 32:11.310
and I'm gonna say,
you know what,

32:12.717 --> 32:14.669
it's been a long time coming,

32:14.701 --> 32:19.500
and I deserve a fucking raise.

32:20.204 --> 32:20.460
- Yeah, that's good.

32:22.188 --> 32:23.372
- Excuse me?

32:23.404 --> 32:25.356
- No,
it's just I've heard

32:25.388 --> 32:27.340
this routine before.

32:30.317 --> 32:32.557
- What, no, fuck, Danny!

32:32.589 --> 32:33.420
Shit!

32:35.756 --> 32:36.812
Danny!

32:41.324 --> 32:42.093
Danny!

32:45.805 --> 32:46.637
Fuck.

32:54.060 --> 32:54.956
Danny.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.444
Danny!

34:07.628 --> 34:08.428
- Hey.

34:10.379 --> 34:11.339
Dan, let's go.

34:13.770 --> 34:14.569
Come on, babe.

34:16.138 --> 34:16.939
Where is she?

34:19.434 --> 34:20.555
Why didn't you wake me?

34:21.739 --> 34:22.891
Danny!

34:22.923 --> 34:25.323
- Ro, I already looked
everywhere for her.

34:25.355 --> 34:28.138
- Okay, I'm going
to go up the road.

34:28.170 --> 34:30.475
You go into the woods in case
she crossed through there.

34:30.507 --> 34:32.075
- Sure, I'm just
gonna put something on.

34:32.106 --> 34:33.003
Maybe a jacket.

34:33.035 --> 34:34.251
- Yeah, take your time.

34:35.403 --> 34:36.810
- I'm sure
she'll come back.

34:39.529 --> 34:40.650
- Oh yeah.

34:54.155 --> 34:54.954
Morning.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.387
- Going out for a smoke.

35:20.457 --> 35:21.258
- Hey.

35:24.713 --> 35:28.042
You guys haven't seen our
dog run up here, have you?

35:29.448 --> 35:30.218
- Nah.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.738
I mean, I just woke
up, so maybe she did.

35:35.978 --> 35:37.961
You need some help looking?

35:37.993 --> 35:39.178
Come on, I'll go with ya.

35:49.705 --> 35:51.242
- You know, you don't
look much like your brother.

35:52.970 --> 35:54.122
- Yeah, foster brother.

35:55.594 --> 35:59.402
Me and Dave used to hang
out when we were teenagers.

36:00.522 --> 36:02.506
His moms took me in
when she found out

36:02.538 --> 36:03.818
I was living on the street.

36:05.864 --> 36:06.920
I think his dad was only into it

36:06.952 --> 36:08.361
because I came with a paycheck.

36:09.513 --> 36:12.520
His mom was nice,
real nice, to me.

36:15.113 --> 36:17.673
Anyway, you don't look
much like your husband.

36:17.704 --> 36:18.505
- That's true.

36:19.465 --> 36:20.264
Danny!

36:24.297 --> 36:25.481
- I want a dog someday,

36:26.920 --> 36:28.967
when I have a house and a yard.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.305
- We have this really tiny
apartment in the city,

36:31.337 --> 36:33.609
so she's not used
to being off leash

36:33.640 --> 36:36.201
and in the woods where
there are coyotes.

36:36.233 --> 36:37.033
Danny?

36:42.376 --> 36:43.367
- Goddamn it.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.167
You stupid fucking idiot.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.217
I'm never gonna hear
the end of this.

36:54.249 --> 36:55.081
Not a chance.

37:01.161 --> 37:01.928
- Danny!

37:07.176 --> 37:09.800
- Damn, girl, you
must run a lot.

37:10.632 --> 37:12.103
You even run when you walk.

37:13.576 --> 37:15.432
Making me realize how
out of shape I'm in,

37:15.464 --> 37:16.328
trying to keep up.

37:18.024 --> 37:18.791
- Hey.

37:19.976 --> 37:22.472
- Hey, anything?

37:22.504 --> 37:23.304
- No.

37:24.424 --> 37:26.408
You know, I don't think
she came up this way.

37:27.336 --> 37:28.104
How's it going?

37:28.135 --> 37:28.936
- Danny!

37:30.375 --> 37:31.176
What up?

37:32.520 --> 37:34.536
- All right, well, you were
the last one to see her,

37:34.568 --> 37:36.552
so where do you think she is?

37:36.584 --> 37:37.704
- Well, I was thinking
maybe we go back,

37:37.735 --> 37:39.368
we get the car,
drive around a bit.

37:39.400 --> 37:42.280
- Why would we do that when
she's probably out in the woods?

37:44.103 --> 37:45.256
- Yep, no, you're right.

37:48.264 --> 37:51.112
Hey, thanks for all your help.

37:51.144 --> 37:51.912
- Thanks.

37:51.944 --> 37:53.512
- No problem, good luck.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.527
It's crooked.

38:55.014 --> 38:55.782
Oh, shit!

38:58.886 --> 39:00.390
Aw, fuck.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.213
Help me get the fucking
thing open, man!

39:16.422 --> 39:18.054
What the fuck are you doing?

39:19.942 --> 39:21.094
- You know, I kinda
miss the place a little.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.630
- Hey, guys!

39:22.662 --> 39:25.574
Oh, sorry, sorry, didn't mean
to scare y'all like that.

39:25.605 --> 39:28.550
It's okay,
it's okay, come on in.

39:28.582 --> 39:32.166
I knew where the key was,
so we just let ourselves in.

39:34.470 --> 39:35.813
So I used to work for Teddy.

39:37.062 --> 39:39.718
I'm Ryan Edwards.

39:40.742 --> 39:42.181
Anybody remember me?

39:43.430 --> 39:44.390
Oh, probably not.

39:45.990 --> 39:47.142
Joey, you were real little.

39:47.174 --> 39:49.766
- I'm sorry, what are
you doing in our house?

39:50.790 --> 39:52.517
- Ruben, right?

39:52.549 --> 39:53.349
- Yeah.

39:54.853 --> 39:58.725
- So me and your pops
was real tight, okay?

39:58.757 --> 40:00.933
I just wanted to say hello.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.340
I know he hasn't
been doing too good,

40:02.373 --> 40:05.669
and we was in the area
so we wanted to come by.

40:05.701 --> 40:07.492
We saw the place was empty.

40:07.525 --> 40:10.181
I remembered the moose
key, so, you know,

40:10.213 --> 40:12.933
I just thought, well,
that would be all right.

40:12.965 --> 40:16.037
- Listen, Teddy died
almost 10 years ago.

40:18.404 --> 40:19.206
- Oh.

40:20.517 --> 40:22.373
I guess it's been
longer than I thought.

40:23.877 --> 40:26.053
- Yeah, we're actually up here

40:26.084 --> 40:27.205
to finally clear the place out.

40:27.237 --> 40:28.612
We're gonna be tearing
this cottage down

40:28.645 --> 40:30.180
and selling the property.

40:31.717 --> 40:33.893
- Wow, okay.

40:36.453 --> 40:37.860
- Were you
in touch with him

40:37.893 --> 40:39.397
when he was sick or something?

40:39.429 --> 40:40.837
- No, no.

40:42.565 --> 40:46.500
I just been gone
a while, I guess.

40:48.388 --> 40:51.556
To be honest with you,
I'm looking for work,

40:52.963 --> 40:56.164
and I just thought
I'd come up here

40:57.540 --> 40:58.756
and maybe Teddy, he'd still
have the business going,

40:58.788 --> 41:03.556
and see if he had
anything for me.

41:04.164 --> 41:04.483
- Oh, oh.

41:07.428 --> 41:10.948
Well, you know, Ryan,
I'm actually thinking

41:10.980 --> 41:13.220
of starting the
business back up again.

41:13.252 --> 41:15.651
You know, maybe relocating
to the next town over.

41:15.684 --> 41:17.796
You know, you could
give me your resume.

41:17.828 --> 41:22.084
I think I do remember you,
and Teddy really liked you,

41:22.116 --> 41:24.708
so, I mean, you know,
that could work out great.

41:24.740 --> 41:25.924
- Serious?

41:25.956 --> 41:27.204
Like, I mean, you...

41:29.764 --> 41:30.628
This is real?

41:33.061 --> 41:34.788
Thank you, guys, so much.

41:34.820 --> 41:38.339
You don't know what
this means to me.

41:41.092 --> 41:42.468
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what the fuck

41:42.500 --> 41:43.556
are you doing?
- Oh, God.

41:43.588 --> 41:46.018
- Your car keys and your wallet.

41:46.051 --> 41:49.123
- Bobby, I know
these people, man.

41:49.155 --> 41:49.955
- No, you don't.

41:51.268 --> 41:52.547
They don't care about you, man.

41:54.050 --> 41:55.108
Let's go.

41:55.140 --> 41:56.515
You, too, let's go.
- All right.

41:56.547 --> 41:59.843
Laurie, Joey, do whatever he
asks, just do whatever he asks.

41:59.875 --> 42:01.027
- Please, don't do this.

42:02.179 --> 42:04.163
- I'm doing you a favor.

42:05.251 --> 42:07.011
These people don't
give a fuck about you.

42:08.802 --> 42:10.851
They're just telling
you what you wanna hear

42:10.883 --> 42:12.515
because we broke
into their cabin.

42:13.635 --> 42:14.947
Give me your fucking purse.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.050
You got something for
me, buddy, huh, huh?

42:18.083 --> 42:19.010
Is that it?

42:19.043 --> 42:20.164
- Yeah.
- You got anything else?

42:20.195 --> 42:21.731
- No, no,
that's it, that's it.

42:27.907 --> 42:30.178
- Guys, please, it's okay.

42:30.211 --> 42:32.067
Everything will be all right.

42:32.098 --> 42:33.187
- Okay.

42:33.219 --> 42:34.083
They're not gonna hurt us.

42:34.115 --> 42:35.075
They just want our money.

42:35.107 --> 42:35.938
Isn't that right?

42:37.059 --> 42:38.818
You're not gonna hurt
us, are you, pal?

42:40.867 --> 42:42.018
No.

42:42.049 --> 42:44.386
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, what are you doing?

42:57.314 --> 42:59.234
Fuck!

42:59.266 --> 43:01.762
Go get him, what are you doing?

43:02.978 --> 43:04.674
The fuck are you doing?

43:08.834 --> 43:10.274
- Wait, wait, wait!

43:22.306 --> 43:23.842
- Took care of that bear for ya.

43:37.923 --> 43:41.025
- We can't just
leave him like this.

43:41.057 --> 43:42.305
- What, do you wanna
call an ambulance?

44:05.409 --> 44:06.273
- There's another one.

44:07.425 --> 44:08.993
- Well, it's a popular area.

44:09.025 --> 44:11.617
She's got her orange
on, she's fine.

44:14.913 --> 44:15.937
- Danny!

44:37.088 --> 44:37.952
- Holy shit.

44:41.792 --> 44:43.232
- Oh my God, Danny!

44:46.239 --> 44:47.841
Hi, baby, oh my God!

44:49.024 --> 44:50.560
I can't believe it!

44:50.592 --> 44:51.328
- Hey, hey!
- Have you just been

44:51.360 --> 44:52.608
here this whole time?

44:52.641 --> 44:53.376
Oh my God!

44:53.408 --> 44:55.232
Did Ricky find you?

45:13.056 --> 45:14.849
- Oh, hey, looks like
Laurie and Ruben made it up.

45:14.881 --> 45:15.681
- Yeah.

45:17.537 --> 45:18.752
Hmm.

45:36.575 --> 45:37.407
- What the fuck is that?

45:40.576 --> 45:41.375
The fuck?

45:43.167 --> 45:45.151
Oh, hell yeah!

45:45.183 --> 45:49.055
Fucking Merry Christmas,
motherfucker!

45:58.175 --> 46:00.960
Don't drink and drive.

46:05.407 --> 46:07.071
- What was he thinking?

46:07.103 --> 46:10.911
What the fuck was
he fucking thinking?

46:10.943 --> 46:14.144
Fuck, man, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck!

46:15.807 --> 46:17.791
- What the fuck are
you doing, Ryan?

46:17.823 --> 46:18.912
- Fuck!

46:21.503 --> 46:22.912
- Fucking fool, fucking.

46:28.479 --> 46:31.070
- Shit, shit, shit.

46:31.102 --> 46:31.902
Where's he going?

46:43.775 --> 46:44.542
What up?

46:50.527 --> 46:52.030
- You planning your escape?
- What?

46:52.062 --> 46:53.246
No, man, I ain't doing nothing!

46:53.278 --> 46:54.238
What the fuck?

46:56.607 --> 46:59.710
Are you gonna shoot
me now, too, huh?

46:59.742 --> 47:01.726
You gonna fucking
shoot me now, too?

47:01.758 --> 47:03.773
Your own fucking brother!

47:10.687 --> 47:13.567
Why'd you have to
kill those people?

47:14.398 --> 47:15.390
Why?

47:25.789 --> 47:30.589
- Look, they showed up,
and I did what I had to do.

47:31.293 --> 47:32.798
- You fucked me.

47:32.830 --> 47:34.333
- I was helping you!

47:34.365 --> 47:35.582
You fucked me!

47:37.630 --> 47:40.349
You never even introduced
me to those people!

47:40.382 --> 47:42.366
It's like you're
ashamed of me, man!

47:45.949 --> 47:47.102
You didn't even
tell 'em my name!

47:51.165 --> 47:52.286
- You're fucking crazy.

47:54.878 --> 47:56.798
I never had a chance
to tell 'em your name

47:56.830 --> 47:58.942
'cause you started
fucking killing everyone!

48:02.430 --> 48:03.996
I'm fucked.

48:04.029 --> 48:05.053
I'm so fucked.

48:05.949 --> 48:07.197
- Come on, Ry-guy.

48:07.230 --> 48:08.574
This was supposed to be fun.

48:09.821 --> 48:10.685
Ry-guy!

48:12.861 --> 48:14.845
Hey, we can't be done yet!

48:14.878 --> 48:17.758
Come on, no one will ever
know, if we stick to the plan!

48:17.790 --> 48:20.925
- You ain't stuck with the
plan since we got up here!

48:20.958 --> 48:23.420
- Okay, that's
true, that's true.

48:23.451 --> 48:26.044
But just hear me out, okay?

48:26.075 --> 48:28.251
We'll dump the car and the van,

48:28.284 --> 48:30.940
and then we'll walk back and
we'll clean the cabin, man.

48:32.605 --> 48:33.755
We gotta make it look

48:33.788 --> 48:35.357
like we were never
in that place, right?

48:37.756 --> 48:40.380
Hey, we're in this together.

48:45.212 --> 48:46.300
I need you, Ryan.

48:53.405 --> 48:54.685
- We out by morning.

48:56.349 --> 48:57.501
Then we're fucking done.

48:58.333 --> 48:59.612
Never wanna see you again.

49:01.405 --> 49:02.620
Just like old times.

50:33.115 --> 50:34.586
- You know, Crystal said

50:34.618 --> 50:36.859
she was all done
wasting time with me.

50:39.003 --> 50:40.251
There wasn't gonna be shit.

50:43.547 --> 50:44.313
I grabbed her.

50:47.931 --> 50:48.986
I didn't mean to, man.

50:52.986 --> 50:55.611
Fucking cut me pretty good
with the kitchen knife, though.

50:56.858 --> 50:58.491
She was so scared.

51:07.515 --> 51:10.395
I just wanted to
hold her, you know?

51:12.346 --> 51:13.306
Quiet her down.

51:15.992 --> 51:17.338
Get that knife away from me.

51:20.346 --> 51:22.106
Guess I don't know
my own strength, huh?

51:24.665 --> 51:26.489
I didn't realize how
hard I was squeezing her.

51:34.265 --> 51:36.025
I just left her there.

51:37.338 --> 51:39.322
Probably found her by now.

51:46.874 --> 51:48.314
- Fuck!

51:59.674 --> 52:01.210
So that was it this whole time.

52:05.690 --> 52:06.970
Played me again.

52:11.865 --> 52:14.073
What the fuck is wrong with me?

52:18.873 --> 52:20.568
What the fuck is wrong with you?

52:20.601 --> 52:24.088
- I needed an out, and
you gave me one, man!

52:24.120 --> 52:25.209
Bring you up north.

52:27.096 --> 52:29.753
You kept saying how you were
gonna change things, you know?

52:29.784 --> 52:30.871
Kept talking about Teddy

52:30.904 --> 52:33.593
and how great
things are up here.

52:34.841 --> 52:36.025
I wanted in on that.

52:37.433 --> 52:38.745
I wanted a clean slate.

52:44.505 --> 52:46.361
You really had
nothing all along.

52:48.793 --> 52:50.841
- I had a shot and
you fucked it all up,

52:52.761 --> 52:54.489
just like everything
else you touch.

52:56.377 --> 52:57.337
- You had nothing,

52:58.744 --> 53:02.393
and you ain't gonna be shit,
just like your big brother.

53:41.624 --> 53:43.544
- So how did the
talk with Mark go?

53:45.336 --> 53:46.296
- It was good, yeah.

53:48.408 --> 53:50.616
We didn't really get
into numbers or anything.

53:50.648 --> 53:52.920
Just more, it was productive.

53:52.952 --> 53:56.344
We got the ball moving.

53:56.376 --> 53:57.175
- Okay.

53:59.544 --> 54:02.326
- It was a
missed opportunity.

54:02.359 --> 54:03.831
I'll try again.
- Yeah.

54:04.854 --> 54:07.766
- Holy shit!
- Jesus Christ!

54:09.239 --> 54:11.511
- No, but I am better
looking, though.

54:11.542 --> 54:13.911
- You guys scared
the shit out of me.

54:13.943 --> 54:16.151
- I thought you heard
us coming up the driveway.

54:18.743 --> 54:21.911
- So, what's up, guys?

54:23.446 --> 54:25.879
- Just wanted to come by
and borrow some sugar.

54:28.246 --> 54:31.575
Sorry, you folks, I
know it's really late.

54:32.823 --> 54:36.630
We're cooking some brownies,

54:39.735 --> 54:41.495
and we realized we
were out of sugar.

54:42.903 --> 54:47.255
- Yeah, we must have some.

54:49.175 --> 54:50.423
- See that, they got some.

54:51.703 --> 54:53.623
Hey, hey, hey, it was
a joke, all right?

54:54.870 --> 54:56.279
Just doing that neighborly
thing, you know?

54:56.311 --> 55:00.629
Like, hey, can we borrow
some sugar, right?

55:04.117 --> 55:06.678
Actually, we were heading out,

55:06.710 --> 55:11.510
and wanted to take you up
on that beer, you know,

55:12.342 --> 55:13.558
if the invite is still open.

55:13.590 --> 55:16.758
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

55:16.790 --> 55:19.190
You want one, too, Rick, was it?

55:20.246 --> 55:21.238
- Ricky!

55:21.270 --> 55:22.806
- Hmm?

55:22.838 --> 55:23.702
- You want a beer?

55:25.398 --> 55:27.062
- Fuck yeah.
- All right.

55:31.190 --> 55:32.054
What the fuck?

55:32.086 --> 55:32.758
You drank the whole thing.

55:52.854 --> 55:54.422
So where's the pup?

55:58.101 --> 56:01.621
- She has a way of
getting into trouble.

56:01.653 --> 56:02.805
She likes to run into the woods,

56:02.837 --> 56:04.885
and that's exactly
what she did today.

56:04.917 --> 56:06.709
Spent half the day
looking for her.

56:06.741 --> 56:08.213
Thanks for that, by the way.

56:09.781 --> 56:10.581
- Yep.

56:12.309 --> 56:14.804
- Maybe Mommy needs to get
herself a little hamster.

56:19.829 --> 56:20.981
- Couldn't help but
overhear you guys

56:21.013 --> 56:22.965
talking about Danny
being on lockdown.

56:29.461 --> 56:31.509
You know, it's
whatever the boss says.

56:34.004 --> 56:35.253
- Sounds like
he's not the only one

56:35.285 --> 56:36.661
on a short leash.

56:36.693 --> 56:39.253
- Look, I just don't want
her going out into the woods.

56:39.285 --> 56:41.749
- You know, it is for the best.

56:41.781 --> 56:44.501
Few years back, we
had another dog Linda.

56:44.533 --> 56:46.836
Unfortunately, she got
dragged into the woods

56:46.869 --> 56:49.685
by a pack of coyotes.

56:49.716 --> 56:51.636
- Y'all should be
worried about coyotes.

56:55.475 --> 56:58.900
They like to pretend they're
something they're not

56:58.932 --> 56:59.892
to fuck with you.

57:01.556 --> 57:02.772
Just like people.

57:05.588 --> 57:06.836
You can't trust 'em,

57:08.980 --> 57:10.644
and they lie to
get what they want.

57:14.708 --> 57:17.268
Did you know that
coyotes will send one out

57:17.300 --> 57:21.043
from the pack to make
friends with your dog?

57:22.036 --> 57:26.420
They'll run around and play,

57:29.044 --> 57:30.740
have a great time,

57:33.428 --> 57:38.228
when, really, coyote's just
leading him right to a trap.

57:39.380 --> 57:43.572
Next thing you know,
poor, stupid mutt

57:45.908 --> 57:50.388
is surrounded, and they
just fucking rip it apart.

57:56.019 --> 57:57.587
- I'm done talking about this.

57:59.347 --> 58:02.611
- So, how's everything
going at Teddy's?

58:02.643 --> 58:04.339
You guys got a lot
more work to do?

58:04.371 --> 58:05.139
- All done.

58:08.467 --> 58:10.099
Moving on to the
next job tomorrow.

58:16.212 --> 58:20.019
What, what's the matter,
big guy, hmm?

58:20.052 --> 58:21.459
- Get the
fuck off me, Bobby.

58:21.491 --> 58:23.123
Don't push me, man.

58:23.155 --> 58:26.899
- These guys have to go.
- Don't fucking push me.

58:28.371 --> 58:29.779
- That's good for you guys.

58:29.810 --> 58:30.963
You know, finding work.

58:30.995 --> 58:33.588
It's been real hard out
here for everyone, so.

58:33.619 --> 58:35.283
- I'm gonna go up to bed.

58:35.314 --> 58:38.419
- Come on, is it
something I said?

58:38.450 --> 58:40.276
- No, just tired.

58:40.308 --> 58:41.843
Can you clean up, please?

58:43.795 --> 58:45.044
- Good boy.
- Yeah, okay.

58:45.076 --> 58:45.906
I'll be right up.

58:47.185 --> 58:49.875
- You gonna be in the doghouse,
you don't get in there.

58:54.450 --> 58:55.890
Give me a smoke.

58:55.922 --> 58:57.330
- Fuck you.
- No.

59:03.409 --> 59:05.107
- You know, it is getting late,

59:05.139 --> 59:09.138
so I should probably
call it, too.

59:12.178 --> 59:13.618
- Get in there, man.
- Yeah.

59:18.098 --> 59:20.050
- Give me a fucking
smoke or what?

59:26.193 --> 59:28.786
Whoa, you got a hot tub, man?

59:28.818 --> 59:30.067
- Yeah, yeah, we do.

59:30.099 --> 59:32.083
- That's fucking nice.

59:32.115 --> 59:34.162
- All right, guys, step
back, it's gonna get smokey.

59:42.961 --> 59:44.369
Well.

59:50.961 --> 59:52.464
So.
- Nice catch.

59:54.162 --> 59:55.793
- What have you guys
got going on after this?

59:57.425 --> 59:58.609
- What the fuck, man?

59:58.641 --> 1:00:00.433
- All over you.

1:00:00.465 --> 1:00:03.473
- You know, guys, I hate
to cut the night short,

1:00:03.505 --> 1:00:07.217
but it's been a hell of a day.

1:00:08.049 --> 1:00:09.458
You know, I'm a little fried.

1:00:11.857 --> 1:00:14.129
You can finish that
beer if you want,

1:00:14.162 --> 1:00:18.288
but I'm just gonna clean
up a little bit and then-

1:00:20.177 --> 1:00:21.553
- Get that fire going again.

1:00:21.585 --> 1:00:22.705
- Again, man.

1:00:22.737 --> 1:00:24.209
- You know, it was
good to see you guys.

1:00:26.257 --> 1:00:28.145
Best of luck on the
new job tomorrow.

1:00:32.177 --> 1:00:34.097
- I think he
wants us to leave, Dave.

1:00:35.250 --> 1:00:38.992
Hey, can we
get one for the road?

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:42.704
- You know what,
those are yours.

1:00:42.736 --> 1:00:43.599
Have at 'em.

1:00:57.329 --> 1:01:00.623
- I don't like
those guys at all.

1:01:00.656 --> 1:01:02.032
- Yeah, I know, hon.

1:01:02.064 --> 1:01:03.696
- No, they're super sketchy,

1:01:03.728 --> 1:01:06.001
and who knows if they even
did work at that cabin

1:01:06.032 --> 1:01:07.312
or worked for Teddy at all.

1:01:09.009 --> 1:01:10.192
- I wouldn't go that far.

1:01:10.223 --> 1:01:11.248
I mean, Laurie and
Ruben are up here,

1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:12.592
Ruben-

1:01:12.624 --> 1:01:14.032
- You're seriously
defending them right now?

1:01:14.063 --> 1:01:15.761
They're lying through
their fucking teeth, Sean.

1:01:15.793 --> 1:01:17.424
- Ro, keep your voice down.

1:01:18.545 --> 1:01:19.984
They might still be out there.

1:01:57.871 --> 1:01:59.024
- Oh my God.

1:01:59.055 --> 1:02:00.720
You have to tell them
to leave right now.

1:02:05.295 --> 1:02:07.855
- This is the fucking life, huh?

1:02:10.351 --> 1:02:11.152
Good stuff, huh?

1:02:13.104 --> 1:02:14.607
Told you we should
go on vacation, man.

1:02:16.015 --> 1:02:17.359
Fucking this is the life.

1:02:17.391 --> 1:02:18.799
- Vacation?

1:02:18.832 --> 1:02:19.920
Motherfucker said vacation.

1:02:19.951 --> 1:02:21.455
- We're away, man,
that's all that matters.

1:02:21.487 --> 1:02:23.247
- We're in
someone else's hot tub.

1:02:23.279 --> 1:02:24.751
- Who gives a fuck, man, huh?

1:02:26.447 --> 1:02:28.656
It's our hot tub now.

1:02:32.814 --> 1:02:35.822
I can hold my breath for
fucking almost 30 seconds, bro.

1:02:38.351 --> 1:02:39.757
- I'm timing it, oh, fuck.

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:41.390
Party's over.

1:02:42.894 --> 1:02:44.557
Get up, get up.

1:02:44.590 --> 1:02:45.582
- Are you kidding me?

1:02:48.750 --> 1:02:50.350
No offense, but what the fuck?

1:02:51.471 --> 1:02:53.423
I said goodnight to
you guys three times.

1:02:53.454 --> 1:02:55.022
Three times!

1:02:56.142 --> 1:02:58.638
Can you please just do
me a favor and go home?

1:02:58.670 --> 1:03:01.581
- "Come on, I said goodnight
to you three times!

1:03:01.614 --> 1:03:03.854
"Why are you guys still here?

1:03:03.886 --> 1:03:05.486
"I want you guys to leave."

1:03:05.518 --> 1:03:06.734
- You sound just like him.

1:03:08.783 --> 1:03:11.631
- I'm just trying to have a
nice evening with my wife, okay?

1:03:11.663 --> 1:03:14.094
I'd just appreciate it if
you guys gave me a break.

1:03:18.510 --> 1:03:19.311
Why not?

1:03:23.439 --> 1:03:25.295
- What the fuck you doing, man?

1:03:25.327 --> 1:03:26.383
Shut up.

1:03:29.293 --> 1:03:30.605
- If you two don't get
off my property right now,

1:03:30.636 --> 1:03:31.822
I'm calling the fucking cops.

1:03:31.853 --> 1:03:33.485
- Whoa.
- Ro, Ro,

1:03:33.516 --> 1:03:34.990
it's all right.
- We gotta go.

1:03:35.022 --> 1:03:36.140
- No, it's not.

1:03:36.173 --> 1:03:37.997
They've overstayed their
welcome long enough.

1:03:38.029 --> 1:03:39.213
You were never welcome.

1:03:39.245 --> 1:03:40.558
You just strolled
over, unannounced,

1:03:40.589 --> 1:03:41.997
invading our privacy.

1:03:42.029 --> 1:03:43.406
- Ro-

1:03:43.438 --> 1:03:44.302
- Look, I asked you nicely,
and now I'm telling you,

1:03:44.333 --> 1:03:45.644
get the fuck out of here.

1:03:45.677 --> 1:03:48.620
- Hey, hey, hey, just
take it easy, huh?

1:03:48.653 --> 1:03:49.517
- Right here.

1:03:49.549 --> 1:03:50.958
- Just having, we're having fun.

1:03:50.990 --> 1:03:52.973
- Yeah, we were, too, before
you two animals showed up.

1:03:53.006 --> 1:03:55.694
You're rude, we
don't even know you.

1:03:55.726 --> 1:03:57.485
Who knows what you're
really doing up here.

1:03:57.516 --> 1:03:59.662
- What?
- Just leave now!

1:03:59.693 --> 1:04:01.613
- What are
you gonna do, huh?

1:04:01.646 --> 1:04:02.478
You gonna call the cops?

1:04:02.510 --> 1:04:03.694
- I will if I have to.

1:04:03.726 --> 1:04:04.877
- You sure
you wanna do that?

1:04:04.909 --> 1:04:07.949
- Look, everybody
just calm down.

1:04:07.981 --> 1:04:09.262
Nobody's gonna call the cops.

1:04:09.293 --> 1:04:10.956
We don't even have
cellphone reception up here.

1:04:16.238 --> 1:04:17.324
Oh God, Jesus Christ.

1:04:17.357 --> 1:04:18.349
- What the fuck?

1:04:18.380 --> 1:04:19.501
- Fuck.

1:04:19.533 --> 1:04:21.453
- Look, guys, guys,
look, this whole night,

1:04:21.485 --> 1:04:24.109
this whole situation, it's
just gotten out of hand,

1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:26.509
and I think it's time
we say goodnight.

1:04:27.469 --> 1:04:28.333
- Okay, goodnight.

1:04:29.645 --> 1:04:30.445
- Please.

1:04:31.916 --> 1:04:33.068
- What the fuck you doing, man?

1:04:33.101 --> 1:04:34.828
- You gotta help
me, I can't see shit.

1:04:42.125 --> 1:04:43.595
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, hold on.

1:04:43.628 --> 1:04:44.460
Wait, wait, wait.

1:04:49.549 --> 1:04:50.605
You gotta help me, man.

1:04:50.637 --> 1:04:52.621
I can't even fucking see.

1:04:54.221 --> 1:04:55.565
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay.

1:04:55.597 --> 1:05:00.397
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, fuck.

1:05:00.844 --> 1:05:01.261
Shit.

1:05:04.141 --> 1:05:05.101
- Is that yours?

1:05:08.268 --> 1:05:10.412
- Hey, man, hey, my bad.

1:05:14.509 --> 1:05:16.653
- Yeah, no, yeah, it's fine.

1:05:16.685 --> 1:05:17.803
- My bad.
- It's fine.

1:05:19.980 --> 1:05:21.133
- I'm really sorry.

1:05:21.165 --> 1:05:24.236
- Yeah, no, you're
good, it's fine.

1:05:29.547 --> 1:05:31.084
Thank you, guys.

1:05:31.116 --> 1:05:32.171
- You're a lucky lady.

1:05:35.980 --> 1:05:36.971
Really, really lucky.

1:05:42.540 --> 1:05:43.340
- Where do we go?

1:05:44.300 --> 1:05:45.580
- We're going.
- Moose Lane?

1:05:47.340 --> 1:05:48.811
- Ricky, Ricky, Ricky.

1:05:48.843 --> 1:05:50.028
- Goodnight, fellas.

1:05:50.060 --> 1:05:51.595
- Thank you.

1:06:01.452 --> 1:06:02.764
- You tell them our cellphones

1:06:02.796 --> 1:06:04.235
don't have reception up here?

1:06:04.268 --> 1:06:05.931
What, are you insane or stupid?

1:06:05.963 --> 1:06:07.244
- I just
wanted them to leave.

1:06:07.276 --> 1:06:08.236
- Yeah, I did, too, that's why I

1:06:08.268 --> 1:06:09.675
threatened to call the cops.

1:06:09.707 --> 1:06:13.227
- Well, I didn't want
them to feel threatened.

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:14.828
- You didn't want them
to feel threatened?

1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:16.619
Why don't you ever stand up
for yourself or your wife,

1:06:16.651 --> 1:06:17.611
your fucking family?

1:06:38.731 --> 1:06:40.811
- Fuck this shit,
man, it's clean.

1:06:42.571 --> 1:06:44.075
- Keep scrubbing, motherfucker.

1:06:45.322 --> 1:06:47.081
- You know, we
could use some seltzer.

1:08:26.281 --> 1:08:27.145
- Told you, I
just wanna make sure

1:08:27.177 --> 1:08:28.169
this fucking shit is cleared up.

1:08:30.855 --> 1:08:31.977
So come on, put the-

1:08:32.009 --> 1:08:33.065
- It's
fucking fine, man.

1:08:33.097 --> 1:08:34.985
- Nah, let's put these...

1:08:36.905 --> 1:08:37.705
This'll work.

1:08:38.729 --> 1:08:40.905
Let's dump this shit on here.

1:08:44.295 --> 1:08:45.673
- Can't see shit, man.

1:08:45.705 --> 1:08:46.857
- Ro!

1:08:46.889 --> 1:08:48.039
- Look at
this, it looks like-

1:08:48.072 --> 1:08:49.417
- Ro!

1:08:49.449 --> 1:08:50.217
- What the fuck?

1:08:50.249 --> 1:08:51.465
- Ro!

1:08:53.225 --> 1:08:57.193
Hey, guys, guys.

1:09:00.488 --> 1:09:01.353
You seen Ro around?

1:09:04.489 --> 1:09:05.319
- Ain't seen her.

1:09:07.944 --> 1:09:08.744
- You sure?

1:09:10.024 --> 1:09:12.776
She went for a run this morning.

1:09:12.808 --> 1:09:14.472
She usually comes
right through here.

1:09:15.911 --> 1:09:18.791
We were hoping to be
on the road by now, so.

1:09:24.232 --> 1:09:25.032
Okay.

1:09:27.272 --> 1:09:28.423
Thanks anyway.

1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:36.616
No, no, you know,
I gotta say this.

1:09:36.647 --> 1:09:37.896
I'm sorry, but, with
all due respect,

1:09:37.927 --> 1:09:41.064
last night, come on, guys.

1:09:41.096 --> 1:09:43.783
I'm trying to have a relaxing
evening with my wife.

1:09:43.815 --> 1:09:45.160
You guys just show
up out of the blue.

1:09:45.192 --> 1:09:47.207
This guy was clearly
shit-faced already,

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:49.032
and then you're pounding beers,

1:09:49.064 --> 1:09:52.264
and you're overstaying
your welcome by a mile!

1:09:52.296 --> 1:09:53.896
And then you get
into my hot tub,

1:09:53.927 --> 1:09:55.656
and then you throw
up in the hot tub?

1:09:55.688 --> 1:09:57.320
I mean, that wasn't cool!

1:09:57.352 --> 1:09:58.823
- Why don't you shut
your bitch mouth?

1:09:59.687 --> 1:10:00.584
Wasn't cool?

1:10:02.728 --> 1:10:04.072
Do you know what I was
gonna do to you last night

1:10:04.104 --> 1:10:06.471
before this cocksucker
decided to toss his cookies?

1:10:07.303 --> 1:10:09.063
You should be thanking him.

1:10:11.526 --> 1:10:12.839
He saved your fucking life.

1:10:12.870 --> 1:10:13.735
- No!

1:10:13.767 --> 1:10:15.175
No!

1:10:15.207 --> 1:10:17.703
What the fuck are you doing?

1:10:17.735 --> 1:10:18.951
- You did something to her!

1:10:18.982 --> 1:10:19.783
Where is she?

1:10:19.815 --> 1:10:21.031
- No, no, no.

1:10:21.063 --> 1:10:21.831
Fuck!

1:10:26.950 --> 1:10:28.167
- Get out of my way!

1:10:28.199 --> 1:10:30.150
Get out!
- No, no!

1:10:30.183 --> 1:10:31.239
- Stand back, move it!

1:10:31.271 --> 1:10:32.135
- Fuck you!

1:10:32.167 --> 1:10:33.415
- Stop it, what are you doing?

1:10:34.823 --> 1:10:36.647
- Oh, no, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1:10:38.567 --> 1:10:39.687
Oh, what the fuck?

1:10:41.062 --> 1:10:42.374
Wait, no!

1:10:42.407 --> 1:10:43.206
Bobby, no, no!

1:10:52.519 --> 1:10:53.319
- Fuck you.

1:11:03.396 --> 1:11:04.742
- What are you doing?

1:11:04.774 --> 1:11:06.182
- Guess you didn't
feel it fall out.

1:11:12.741 --> 1:11:14.438
Just getting rid of
all the evidence.

1:11:45.222 --> 1:11:46.086
Oh, fuck.

1:11:52.070 --> 1:11:52.934
Ro!

1:12:18.628 --> 1:12:19.973
- You've gotta help me, please!

1:12:20.005 --> 1:12:21.733
These two guys attacked
my husband up the hill,

1:12:21.764 --> 1:12:22.949
and I-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:12:22.981 --> 1:12:25.092
Two punks came in here
yesterday, robbed me,

1:12:25.125 --> 1:12:28.517
messed up my store,
smashed my phone.

1:12:28.549 --> 1:12:29.317
- Do you have a cellphone?
- Probably the same two guys

1:12:29.349 --> 1:12:30.694
you're talking about.

1:12:30.725 --> 1:12:31.812
- Do you have a car?
- No, I don't have a car.

1:12:31.845 --> 1:12:32.645
- Is there anybody
else here who can help?

1:12:32.676 --> 1:12:34.437
- I cannot help you.

1:12:34.469 --> 1:12:35.333
- They are coming!

1:12:36.229 --> 1:12:37.957
- Penny, lock the door.

1:12:41.924 --> 1:12:42.725
- Ro!

1:12:43.877 --> 1:12:44.773
Fuck.

1:12:44.804 --> 1:12:45.925
Ro!

1:12:45.957 --> 1:12:47.653
Ro, come on, I ain't
gonna hurt you.

1:12:47.684 --> 1:12:48.901
Let me in!
- No.

1:12:48.934 --> 1:12:50.052
- Let me in!
- You are a fucking liar!

1:12:50.085 --> 1:12:51.493
- No, no, no, no!
- I saw what you did!

1:12:51.524 --> 1:12:54.694
- No, come on, that was
all Bobby, I swear to God!

1:12:54.725 --> 1:12:58.533
I didn't kill that family, he
killed that family, all right?

1:12:58.564 --> 1:13:00.292
I was protecting Sean.

1:13:00.324 --> 1:13:02.435
I had nothing to do
with any of this.

1:13:02.468 --> 1:13:03.620
My brother is-
- You're just like him.

1:13:03.652 --> 1:13:05.636
You are, no, you're
just like him!

1:13:05.667 --> 1:13:07.044
- No, I'm not!
- Get out of here!

1:13:07.076 --> 1:13:08.228
We called the cops, all
right, they're on their way.

1:13:08.260 --> 1:13:10.467
- Good, great, I've
never been happier

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:12.196
to hear that in my goddamn life!

1:13:12.228 --> 1:13:14.372
Call the cops, please!

1:13:14.404 --> 1:13:16.516
We'll go, we'll go get your car.

1:13:16.548 --> 1:13:17.795
- No way I'm going with you.
- Then we'll go right

1:13:17.828 --> 1:13:19.589
to the police, okay?

1:13:19.620 --> 1:13:20.771
- I don't care-
- I will not hurt you.

1:13:20.804 --> 1:13:21.987
- I don't care what
you have to say.

1:13:22.020 --> 1:13:22.947
- Trust me.
- I don't believe you,

1:13:22.980 --> 1:13:23.940
all right?
- Come on!

1:13:23.972 --> 1:13:25.668
You gotta let me in!

1:13:25.700 --> 1:13:27.236
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1:13:29.028 --> 1:13:30.500
Fuck!

1:13:30.532 --> 1:13:31.396
I'm coming in!

1:15:39.490 --> 1:15:41.250
- I'm gonna get-
- Get off of me!

1:15:41.282 --> 1:15:42.466
No!
- No, no, no, no.

1:15:42.498 --> 1:15:43.266
- No!

1:15:43.298 --> 1:15:44.898
Stop, stop, stop it.

1:15:51.617 --> 1:15:53.441
- Shut up, fucking
stop fighting me.

1:16:00.032 --> 1:16:02.881
- Please, I'm
pregnant, I'm pregnant.

1:16:09.024 --> 1:16:12.481
- You fucking goddamn fucking
motherfucker!

1:16:19.553 --> 1:16:21.090
Fucking goddamn it!

1:16:21.922 --> 1:16:23.361
Fucking bitch!

1:16:49.920 --> 1:16:50.911
Ow!

1:17:48.224 --> 1:17:49.312
- Ro.

1:17:57.984 --> 1:17:59.295
Don't do it, please.

1:18:02.910 --> 1:18:04.608
Just give me the gun.

1:18:06.207 --> 1:18:07.679
We're okay, we're okay.

1:18:12.352 --> 1:18:13.887
We're okay, okay.

1:18:29.664 --> 1:18:30.846
All right, sir, I've got

1:18:30.879 --> 1:18:32.031
two units heading
there right now.

1:18:32.062 --> 1:18:33.344
They should be there
in about five minutes.

1:18:34.239 --> 1:18:35.392
You did the right thing.

1:18:36.447 --> 1:18:37.214
- Thank you.

1:20:04.253 --> 1:20:05.149
- Get away!

1:20:05.981 --> 1:20:07.357
Get away!

1:20:07.390 --> 1:20:08.286
Get away!

1:20:09.118 --> 1:20:10.078
Get away!

1:20:10.110 --> 1:20:11.837
Get the fuck away from me!

1:20:11.869 --> 1:20:13.725
Get the fuck away, come on!
