she has the capacity

09:04.108 --> 09:05.414
to make end-of-life decisions,

09:05.457 --> 09:07.459
but I'd really like
a second opinion.

that Dr. Charles

09:09.026 --> 09:10.724
is in his office today.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.160
It's his day off, though.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.162
- Maybe he wouldn't mind
doing a quick capacity eval.

09:14.205 --> 09:17.208
- Let's ask him.
- Yeah.

09:17.252 --> 09:20.255
- Hey, Dean,
just a little reminder--

09:20.298 --> 09:22.823
I got my dad's
military committal service.

09:22.866 --> 09:25.608
- Oh, I was just gonna offer to
chauffeur since I'm going too.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.436
- It's nice of you,
but it's just going to be me,

09:27.479 --> 09:29.656
a few neighbors, and a couple
guys he served with.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.048
- Oh, okay.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.224
- I'm just saying,
you don't have to--

09:33.268 --> 09:36.314
- No, I want to.
Your father was one of us.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.360
- Appreciate that.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.362
- Dr. Choi or Dr. Archer,

I've got Zach Dayle-Kalmick
in Treatment 4--

09:43.626 --> 09:46.542
16-year-old male, injured
his knee playing lacrosse.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.630
- Ah.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.678
- Do you know
the origins of lacrosse?

09:51.721 --> 09:53.505
- Pops, stop.
- Truly, Peter, give it a rest.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.726
- It was used to prepare
warriors for combat.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.815
Does that sound like a game
16-year-olds should be playing?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.861
Okay, this is Zach's
third injury this season.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.210
- Agh.
- Sorry, buddy.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.646
Pes anserinus.
- Pes what?

10:03.690 --> 10:06.127
Can--can you spell that?
Is that one word or two?

10:06.170 --> 10:08.259
- Okay, Peter.
We're going for a walk.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.304
What are you talking about?
Zach needs us here.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.871
- I don't.
- He doesn't,

10:10.914 --> 10:14.396
and the doctors need you
out of their way, so come on.

10:14.439 --> 10:15.876
- Page ortho.
I want a full work-up

10:15.919 --> 10:16.833
on that knee.

10:19.575 --> 10:24.449
- Pes ans--whatever.
Is that serious?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.408
'Cause there's a scout from
Villanova coming in two weeks,

10:26.451 --> 10:27.975
and he's gotta see me play.

10:28.018 --> 10:31.021
- Pes anserinus is just
a fancy way of saying bursitis,

10:31.065 --> 10:32.544
which is another
fancy way of saying

10:32.588 --> 10:34.242
sac on the side of the knee.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.853
It's definitely painful,
but not a big problem.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.420
- You're gonna get an MRI--

10:38.463 --> 10:39.726
see if there's
anything else going on.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.430

can I talk to you for a second?

10:50.084 --> 10:53.609
Um, should Julia
maybe not donate?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.133
- Well, we haven't gotten
her lab work back yet,

10:56.177 --> 10:57.569
so it's too soon to decide
if the transplant

10:57.613 --> 10:59.093
needs to be postponed.
- No, no,

10:59.136 --> 11:00.442
I don't mean postponed.

11:00.485 --> 11:03.140
I'm asking

You know, brain damage

Dr. Scott?

12:38.235 --> 12:39.367

about breaking up with Julia

12:47.854 --> 12:49.681
when he was told
he needed a transplant.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.293
But then immediately,
Julia offered to get tested.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.556
- And obviously,
Owen didn't try to stop her.

by her generosity,

falling in love with her.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.611

transfusions over the years,

finds another donor, if ever.

your expertise.

However, that does carry
a slight chance of stroke,
