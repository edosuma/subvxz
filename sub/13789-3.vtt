WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.049
You know, I've never been
to one of these

00:08.049 --> 00:10.131
BMX bike competitions
before,

00:10.131 --> 00:11.762
but I figured
your stunts would be

00:11.762 --> 00:13.894
a little more complicated
than what you're doing

00:13.894 --> 00:16.267
and that there'd be a bike.

00:16.267 --> 00:19.520
No, Stan. This is
just me pacing
beforehand.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.192
I'm really nervous, man.

00:21.192 --> 00:22.903
I mean, this competition
is a big deal.

00:22.903 --> 00:24.445
It's not some
amateur hour.

00:24.445 --> 00:26.697
It's a full two hours.

00:26.697 --> 00:28.699
You've been training
all year, Tyler.

00:28.699 --> 00:30.361
I believe in you.

00:30.361 --> 00:32.323
You're going to nail it.
You really think so?

00:32.323 --> 00:34.325
I have no idea.
I know nothing about this.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.706
A minute ago,
I thought the pacing

00:35.706 --> 00:37.288
was your competition.

00:53.434 --> 00:56.267
Thank you.
And this is only
my fourth best thing

00:56.267 --> 00:58.439
next to my hair, math,

00:58.439 --> 01:00.561
and identifying
types of clouds.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.354
Snowman.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.240
Hey, Tyler.
Great riding, man!

01:09.240 --> 01:11.402
You're really cleanin' up
at these amateur competitions.

01:11.402 --> 01:13.994
Hey, Red.
Thanks so much, man.

01:13.994 --> 01:16.577
It means a lot
coming from a pro.
How'd you like to be a pro?

01:16.577 --> 01:19.250
Would we switch bodies or
something, like in the movies?

01:19.250 --> 01:22.503
'Cause I've just learned
how to be comfortable
in my own skin.

01:22.503 --> 01:26.127
No, you'd join our
pro BMX team.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.420
We'd keep our bodies, dude.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.422
The only catch is
we start in spring

01:31.422 --> 01:32.633
so you'd have to
drop out of school.

01:32.633 --> 01:33.804
Oh, man, I don't think

01:33.804 --> 01:35.846
my parents are gonna go
for that,

01:35.846 --> 01:38.349
unless I think
of a really clever way
to trick them into it.

01:38.349 --> 01:41.432
Yeah, I'm not sure
you're that clever, son.

01:41.432 --> 01:44.605
Oh, I'm clever.
I'm just not good at hearing
people sneak up behind me.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.318
Too bad.
It's a skill I myself
find very useful.

01:47.318 --> 01:49.820
Tyler.
Ah!

01:49.820 --> 01:52.943
Tyler, why would you think
that we'd ever let you
quit school?

01:52.943 --> 01:54.495
Since when are you
one of my parents?

01:54.495 --> 01:56.327
We speak with one voice.

01:56.327 --> 01:57.408
We do?

01:57.408 --> 01:58.909
See?

02:16.347 --> 02:18.849
Come on, guys.
You're not even
making sense.

02:18.849 --> 02:21.312
People go to school
so they can get
their dream job.

02:21.312 --> 02:24.355
You're making me go to school
so I can lose my dream job.

02:24.355 --> 02:26.897
I thought your dream job was
to own your own food truck.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.399
I can still
do that someday.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.611
BMX riders
normally retire at 24

02:30.611 --> 02:32.403
because they get
so banged up, they--

02:32.403 --> 02:34.825
I'm not helping
my argument, am I?

02:34.825 --> 02:37.328
No, Tyler,

02:37.328 --> 02:39.280
there's no way
you're dropping out of school.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.832
After you graduate, then
you can ride professionally.

02:41.832 --> 02:44.335
But these spots
don't open up that often.

02:44.335 --> 02:46.667
It could be five years
before someone else drops out,

02:46.667 --> 02:48.289
or gets so mangled, they--

02:48.289 --> 02:51.212
I'm really not helping
my argument, am I?

02:51.212 --> 02:53.053
Tyler,
you're finishing school.

02:53.053 --> 02:54.385
Case closed.

02:54.385 --> 02:56.136
I wanted to say
"case closed."

02:56.136 --> 02:57.888
I'm the one who watches
the judge shows.

02:57.888 --> 02:59.390
Go ahead.

02:59.390 --> 03:01.222
Nope, too late.
You ruined it.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.224
You know
how to make it up to me.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.146
All rise.

03:14.405 --> 03:16.777
You're lucky, Stan.
You get to do
what you want.

03:16.777 --> 03:19.410
Yep, I nap,
I lie in the sun,

03:19.410 --> 03:22.283
and I order meatball subs
from Antonio's.

03:22.283 --> 03:24.285
I'd also tell you about
the poodle twins I'm dating,

03:24.285 --> 03:27.207
but that would be bragging.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.331
Wow. There is no part
of your life that doesn't work.

03:30.331 --> 03:32.333
Well, maybe that's
'cause I finished school.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.295
Sure,
it was obedience school,

03:34.295 --> 03:35.466
but I can sit, stay,

03:35.466 --> 03:37.678
and balance a snack
on my nose.

03:37.678 --> 03:39.600
I can only do
two of those things.

03:44.144 --> 03:46.437
Why am I too restless
to stay?

03:49.770 --> 03:51.942
I do have it
pretty great.

03:51.942 --> 03:53.944
I can't think of how my life
could get any better.

03:53.944 --> 03:55.406
( doorbell rings )

03:55.406 --> 03:56.947
Hey, Antonio.

03:56.947 --> 03:59.320
Just leave the meatball sub
at the door like usual

03:59.320 --> 04:01.282
and charge it
to my account.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.414
That's Bennett James.

04:04.575 --> 04:06.417
Sometimes I like to buy
small things

04:06.417 --> 04:07.668
with Bennett's credit card.

04:07.668 --> 04:09.460
Hey, Antonio,

04:09.460 --> 04:12.212
is there a hang glider-shaped
package out there?

04:15.296 --> 04:17.217
Hey, Chloe.
What's up?

04:17.217 --> 04:18.879
I want to get
a new haircut.

04:18.879 --> 04:20.220
I made a picture
on the internet

04:20.220 --> 04:21.221
of how I want to look.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.016
Say the right thing,
Ellen.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.227
Don't screw this up.

04:27.227 --> 04:28.268
You want to look
like a carnie?

04:28.268 --> 04:30.270
Dang it!

04:30.270 --> 04:33.023
I think what your mother
was trying, but failing,

04:33.023 --> 04:36.357
to say is that we support
whatever you choose.

04:36.357 --> 04:38.238
No, I made that one
for fun.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.401
Oh, thank goodness,
because you look like a carnie.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.744
This is the one I want.

04:45.666 --> 04:48.208
All the other girls
are getting short haircuts

04:48.208 --> 04:50.290
and it looked so cute.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.543
So can I?
Please?

04:52.543 --> 04:53.754
Nope.
Yes.

04:53.754 --> 04:55.586
Thanks, Mommy!

04:55.586 --> 04:59.380
No, no, wait.
I think your mother and I
need to discuss this.

04:59.380 --> 05:01.051
Okay, you two
talk about it.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.473
Mommy, convince him.

05:02.473 --> 05:04.845
Do that thing he calls
"emotional blackmail."

05:04.845 --> 05:06.977
I don't know what it is,
but it always works.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.641
Honey, I love her long,
beautiful hair.

05:10.641 --> 05:12.353
I don't want it
to get cut.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.355
Bennett, it's a lot of work
for me to take care of.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.236
Short hair would be
so much easier.

05:16.236 --> 05:17.818
You know what,
it's my job so that's it.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.610
Well, you seem
very determined about this

05:19.610 --> 05:21.111
so I'm going to suggest

05:21.111 --> 05:22.443
that we finish
this argument later

05:22.443 --> 05:24.324
when you're tired.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.947
Good day.

05:26.947 --> 05:29.119
He just left.

05:29.119 --> 05:30.751
That's genius.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.507
Tyler, you know,

05:36.507 --> 05:38.128
your shoes
are on the wrong feet.

05:38.128 --> 05:39.670
Why should my feet
get to be happy

05:39.670 --> 05:43.133
when the rest of me
is so sad?

05:43.133 --> 05:45.225
Oh, does that mean
you're gonna cancel

05:45.225 --> 05:47.468
your 5:00 p.m. foot licking?

05:47.468 --> 05:50.230
'Cause I'm still gonna
have to charge you.

05:50.230 --> 05:52.853
I've never had
such a great opportunity

05:52.853 --> 05:54.525
to do something I love.

05:54.525 --> 05:57.147
BMX is my dream.
What about the food truck?

05:57.147 --> 05:58.318
Why does everyone
keep mentioning

05:58.318 --> 06:00.240
the stupid food truck?

06:00.240 --> 06:02.823
The food truck
will always be there.

06:02.823 --> 06:05.035
I just wish I didn't
have to finish high school.

06:05.035 --> 06:06.617
Too bad you're not
a better student,

06:06.617 --> 06:08.579
or you could just test
into the accelerated program

06:08.579 --> 06:10.751
and graduate early enough
to join the BMX tour.

06:10.751 --> 06:13.414
Yeah. Wait, those words
are making their way

06:13.414 --> 06:15.756
deeper into my brain.

06:15.756 --> 06:19.590
I can test into an
accelerated program
that lets me graduate early.

06:19.590 --> 06:22.302
Well, you can, in the sense
that nobody is stopping you,

06:22.302 --> 06:25.305
but you can't
in the sense that...

06:25.305 --> 06:27.217
...you?

06:30.350 --> 06:31.642
Laugh all you want.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.393
We did.
We're pretty much done now.

06:36.066 --> 06:37.728
I know I've never been
a good student

06:37.728 --> 06:40.320
but that's 'cause
I never had a reason to care.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.192
You guys are gonna see
what I'm capable of.

06:42.192 --> 06:44.284
I'm gonna graduate early
and follow my dream.

06:44.284 --> 06:46.156
You won't regret it, Tyler.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.198
I graduated from
obedience school

06:48.198 --> 06:50.410
and now I have a giant house
in Pasadena

06:50.410 --> 06:52.412
with five servants.

06:58.378 --> 07:00.210
There's my
apple-cheeked angel.

07:00.210 --> 07:02.342
Interesting.

07:02.342 --> 07:05.385
Let me cut my hair,
and you can pinch my
apple cheeks.

07:05.385 --> 07:08.679
You know you want to.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.311
Chloe, I'm gonna talk to
your mother about this later

07:11.311 --> 07:12.853
and we will get back
to you.

07:12.853 --> 07:14.394
I'll sweeten the pot.

07:16.396 --> 07:19.860
Honey, I just don't think
you should cut your hair short

07:19.860 --> 07:22.232
because all the other girls
are doing it.

07:22.232 --> 07:24.404
If all the other girls
jumped off a cliff,
would you do that?

07:24.404 --> 07:26.366
Maybe, if it was over
a chocolate river

07:26.366 --> 07:28.489
and all the rocks were
fluffy cupcakes.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.491
I wasn't expecting
that answer.

07:30.491 --> 07:32.122
Well, you should have been.

07:33.914 --> 07:36.206
What if the rocks
were not fluffy cupcakes

07:36.206 --> 07:38.579
but were just regular rocks?

07:38.579 --> 07:41.381
Then I'd be like,
"Hey, you guys,
there's rocks down there.

07:41.381 --> 07:43.293
Let's go to my house
and play."

07:43.293 --> 07:45.385
And they'd be like,
"Yay, Chloe!"

07:47.297 --> 07:48.849
Okay.
How about this?

07:48.849 --> 07:50.641
Who is your
favorite princess?

07:50.641 --> 07:54.304
Rapunzel
and she has long hair.

07:54.304 --> 07:56.517
You sly taco.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.019
I took advantage
of that website

07:59.019 --> 08:01.652
you found to see
what you would look like
with Rapunzel hair,

08:01.652 --> 08:03.483
and I was gonna show this
to your mother

08:03.483 --> 08:06.366
but since you're here...

08:06.366 --> 08:08.569
Oh, no.
Not that one.

08:08.569 --> 08:11.201
That's a project
Daddy's working on.

08:13.453 --> 08:17.207
I look like
a real princess.

08:17.207 --> 08:19.209
Okay, I'm not
cutting my hair.

08:19.209 --> 08:21.542
Come here, let me give those
apple cheeks a pinch.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.545
Sorry, that was
part of the short-hair package.

08:33.223 --> 08:35.556
I can't study with you
breathing down my neck.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.899
I'm sorry, I just can't
take my eyes off this.

08:38.899 --> 08:41.101
Seeing you try to do
schoolwork,

08:41.101 --> 08:42.733
it's like watching
a silverback gorilla

08:42.733 --> 08:45.566
trying to figure out
luggage.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.527
Well, that's
not fair, Avery.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.740
Animals can do
anything people can do.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.241
Provided they rubbed a lamp
like I did

08:51.241 --> 08:53.533
when that genie granted me
the ability to talk.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.575
BOTH: What?

08:54.575 --> 08:55.746
Nah, I'm kidding.

08:55.746 --> 08:59.289
I'm a regular talking dog.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.162
And if I had a genie,
I'd wish for something good,

09:02.162 --> 09:04.164
like a hang glider.

09:04.164 --> 09:06.166
So when it comes,
that's how I got it.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.218
Not your dad's
credit card.

09:20.390 --> 09:24.394
I got it right?
No, you just got it wrong
in an unfunny way.

09:24.394 --> 09:26.316
Mom and Dad
already said that

09:26.316 --> 09:27.818
if I get into
the accelerated program

09:27.818 --> 09:30.360
and graduate early,
I can go on the BMX tour.

09:30.360 --> 09:34.244
But if I don't pass the test,
I have no shot at my dream.

09:34.244 --> 09:36.827
So instead of making fun of me,
Avery,

09:36.827 --> 09:37.958
maybe you could help me.

09:37.958 --> 09:39.620
I'm sorry, Tyler.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.292
I feel really bad.
What do you want me to do?

09:42.292 --> 09:43.964
Well, you know
how these books are filled

09:43.964 --> 09:45.666
with all kinds of information?

09:50.210 --> 09:52.212
Yes.

09:52.212 --> 09:55.886
Can you take it from there
and put it in here?

09:57.978 --> 10:00.851
You mean, tutor you
so that you pass the tests?

10:00.851 --> 10:02.392
I'd really like
to help you, Tyler,

10:02.392 --> 10:04.184
but I've got
a lot of work myself.

10:04.184 --> 10:05.896
You're right.
You're right.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.028
You could probably never get me
to be a good student anyway.

10:08.028 --> 10:09.319
I'm too big
a challenge for you.

10:09.319 --> 10:11.652
I see what you're doing.

10:11.652 --> 10:13.824
You're trying to tempt me
into helping you

10:13.824 --> 10:16.076
by making it sound
like a challenge.

10:16.076 --> 10:18.078
And it's starting to work.

10:19.159 --> 10:20.370
Making you a good student

10:20.370 --> 10:22.663
could be my
greatest achievement.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.294
This could be my legacy,

10:24.294 --> 10:26.006
my chance to win
the Anne Sullivan Award

10:26.006 --> 10:27.087
for Difficult Tutoring.

10:27.087 --> 10:28.088
I don't know who that is.

10:28.088 --> 10:29.169
She tutored Helen Keller.

10:29.169 --> 10:31.551
I don't know who that is.

10:31.551 --> 10:33.553
All right, I'm ready
to start learning.

10:33.553 --> 10:35.966
Ellen, got the mail!

10:35.966 --> 10:40.020
Nothing but catalogs
and the--

10:40.020 --> 10:42.022
Who keeps chewing up
the credit card bill?

10:42.022 --> 10:43.473
I can't even read this.

10:43.473 --> 10:46.687
Seems like something
Chloe would do.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.610
What do you mean
you talked to Chloe about it?

10:50.610 --> 10:52.272
You and I were supposed
to talk about it first.

10:52.272 --> 10:54.534
But Chloe was in my office
and it just came up.

10:54.534 --> 10:56.616
We'll finish this
argument later. Good day.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.914
I did not do
that properly, did I?

11:03.914 --> 11:07.377
Ellen, look how beautiful
she is with long hair.

11:07.377 --> 11:08.919
Bennett, what are you--

11:08.919 --> 11:10.380
No, not--
not that one.

11:10.380 --> 11:13.093
That's a project
I'm working on.

11:15.095 --> 11:17.257
Look, if you want her hair
to stay long,

11:17.257 --> 11:18.468
you can take care of it
from now on.

11:18.468 --> 11:20.390
Fine, I will.
No, you will-- Wait, what?

11:22.262 --> 11:23.764
That was
surprisingly easy.

11:23.764 --> 11:25.766
I like her hair long,
so it's worth it to me.

11:25.766 --> 11:27.107
I mean,
I'm fine with that.

11:27.107 --> 11:29.269
Now can we please talk about

11:29.269 --> 11:31.732
who's been using my razor
in the shower?

11:31.732 --> 11:34.444
We'll finish this
argument later.
Good day.

11:38.618 --> 11:40.160
That's my razor.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.621
You're using my razor.

11:41.621 --> 11:44.915
Oh.
Good day.

11:51.091 --> 11:53.463
Well, Tyler,
I scored your practice test

11:53.463 --> 11:56.046
and bad news,
you got a 50.

11:56.046 --> 11:57.547
Bad news?

11:57.547 --> 11:59.389
That's the difference
between us.

11:59.389 --> 12:01.051
You see the test
as half wrong.

12:01.051 --> 12:04.014
I see the test
as half full.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.346
One other difference
between us.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.228
I'm going to graduate
high school.

12:09.559 --> 12:11.561
Tyler, how did you
get a 50?

12:11.561 --> 12:14.314
I got a 70.
How did you get a 70?

12:14.314 --> 12:15.946
I filled in the circles
in the shape of a bone

12:15.946 --> 12:17.527
and got lucky.

12:17.527 --> 12:20.360
These tests have
a well-known canine bias.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.032
If you want
to pass the test

12:22.032 --> 12:23.954
to get into
the accelerated program,

12:23.954 --> 12:25.996
you're going to have to learn
everything in these packets.

12:25.996 --> 12:29.329
No, no.
I don't like school.

12:29.329 --> 12:31.501
I've never been
good at school.
I can't do this.

12:31.501 --> 12:34.714
It'll be okay.
We just need to find
the way that you learn.

12:34.714 --> 12:37.798
Or your lucky shape.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.800
I am going to rise
to the challenge

12:39.800 --> 12:41.341
and get through to you

12:41.341 --> 12:43.263
using all of the diligence
and ingenuity

12:43.263 --> 12:45.725
that have made me
the successful student I am.

12:45.725 --> 12:48.348
I will not back down,
I will not give in,

12:48.348 --> 12:49.229
and you will not fail.

12:49.229 --> 12:51.521
Maybe yours is
a hamburger.

12:56.316 --> 12:58.488
And then, I saw a shawl
on the floor and said,

12:58.488 --> 13:00.360
"Look, someone
lost their shawl,"

13:00.360 --> 13:03.113
and then Mason was all like,
"No, I think a witch melted."

13:03.113 --> 13:05.405
What a mind.

13:05.405 --> 13:08.578
Uh, sorry, sweets.

13:08.578 --> 13:10.250
Looks like we lost
another brush.

13:12.712 --> 13:14.915
Well, your hair will
just have to grow around them.

13:14.915 --> 13:17.087
But I don't like
my hair knotted.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.339
Well, we all have to deal
with things we don't like.

13:19.339 --> 13:20.630
I don't like that
extra scene

13:20.630 --> 13:22.632
after the end credits
in movies.

13:22.632 --> 13:24.304
I have to pee.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.354
Chloe,

13:34.354 --> 13:36.776
why is there a turtle
in your hair?

13:36.776 --> 13:38.818
Because it's safe
and warm,

13:38.818 --> 13:40.440
and Snappy likes to eat
the lettuce I keep in there.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.402
What?
What?

13:43.573 --> 13:45.405
And why did you
name him Snappy?

13:45.405 --> 13:46.786
Because-- Aah!

13:48.408 --> 13:50.290
Oh, this is
a nightmare, honey.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.412
How does your mommy
even do this?

13:52.412 --> 13:54.714
She doesn't mess with Snappy,
that's for sure.

13:56.796 --> 13:59.719
You are gonna look so pretty
when I'm done.

14:02.092 --> 14:03.884
I'm going out
on a limb here,

14:03.884 --> 14:06.346
but is it possible you miss
doing this with Chloe?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.558
I miss doing
this with Chloe.

14:08.558 --> 14:10.730
It was our
mommy-daughter time.

14:10.730 --> 14:14.895
Ah, and that 70%
was just luck, huh?

14:14.895 --> 14:16.977
I know what you're
thinking, Stan.

14:16.977 --> 14:18.738
"Well, now, Ellen,

14:18.738 --> 14:21.531
you're the one who told Bennett
to do her hair."

14:21.531 --> 14:23.533
That's how
you think I talk?

14:23.533 --> 14:26.246
First of all,
I have a Chicago accent

14:26.246 --> 14:30.160
with a little
surfer dude mixed in.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.293
"Why don't y'all just go
tell him how you feel, eh?"

14:33.293 --> 14:34.584
Okay, now what was that?

14:34.584 --> 14:36.336
I heard Alabama,
I heard Canada,

14:36.336 --> 14:38.128
you're all over the map!

14:38.128 --> 14:41.381
"Sorry this is
so rough on you.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.382
Get it?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.383
Ruff.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.556
Good one, Stan."

14:46.556 --> 14:50.010
I have never been
this close to talking to you

14:50.010 --> 14:51.721
or felt this pretty.

14:55.355 --> 14:57.727
Okay, you're great at BMX.

14:57.727 --> 14:59.319
So I'm going to recreate

14:59.319 --> 15:00.690
the conditions of learning
bike tricks,

15:00.690 --> 15:02.692
only instead of bike tricks,

15:02.692 --> 15:04.614
you'll be learning landmark
Supreme Court cases.

15:04.614 --> 15:07.407
Instead of bike pads,
should I be wearing legal pads?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.619
Class clown.

15:09.619 --> 15:12.953
Okay, feel the wind
in your face.

15:15.585 --> 15:17.797
Pedal.
Pedal.

15:17.797 --> 15:21.041
What decision established
the right to an attorney?
I don't know.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.092
Well, do you know
if you're riding

15:22.092 --> 15:23.423
your bike through the woods?

15:25.385 --> 15:26.386
Oh, there's a crow.

15:26.386 --> 15:27.427
Caw!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.259
Caw!

15:29.259 --> 15:31.101
I don't ride my bike
through the woods,

15:31.101 --> 15:32.352
so stop throwing
dirt at me.

15:32.352 --> 15:33.813
Fine.

15:37.107 --> 15:39.479
What decision established
the right to an attorney?

15:39.479 --> 15:40.981
Ribbit.
Ribbit.

15:42.192 --> 15:43.613
You saw my BMX
competition.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.235
There were no frogs there.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.367
I was mostly
texting my friends.

15:47.367 --> 15:48.328
Moo.

15:48.328 --> 15:50.330
Moo.

15:50.330 --> 15:52.332
Moo.
Stop making animal noises.

15:52.332 --> 15:55.575
Come on,
what decision established
the right to an attorney?

15:55.575 --> 15:57.247
Gideon versus...

15:57.247 --> 15:58.458
Stop throwing things at me

15:58.458 --> 16:00.420
and get my bike
off this thing.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.292
You're not making
learning fun,

16:02.292 --> 16:05.175
you're making riding bikes
in the house awful.

16:05.175 --> 16:06.216
Whoa!

16:11.351 --> 16:12.722
Really?

16:12.722 --> 16:14.354
It's common knowledge
that hang gliders

16:14.354 --> 16:16.556
have the right of way
in the backyard!

16:18.308 --> 16:20.060
Gideon v. Wainwright!

16:23.523 --> 16:25.315
I know you may be beginning
to question my methods.

16:25.315 --> 16:27.447
And your sanity.

16:27.447 --> 16:30.160
But I've given this
a lot more thought,

16:30.160 --> 16:32.322
and I realized what
you love about BMX is
that it's fun.

16:32.322 --> 16:34.204
You can forget it.
You lost my trust, Avery.

16:34.204 --> 16:35.875
I'm not doing it.
It involves you--

16:35.875 --> 16:37.207
Nope.
Learning about
Supreme Court cases--

16:37.207 --> 16:39.039
No way.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.500
By playing your favorite
TV game show, Whoopsy!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.542
You can forget--
Whoopsy!

16:43.883 --> 16:45.835
So I've set up the family room

16:45.835 --> 16:47.257
to replicate
all of the obstacles

16:47.257 --> 16:48.838
that you find on Whoopsy.

16:48.838 --> 16:51.131
This is just a bunch of junk
from the garage.

16:51.131 --> 16:53.723
But it can magically transform
using the power--

16:53.723 --> 16:55.305
Don't say imagination.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.438
of imagin--
make-believe.

16:58.438 --> 17:01.191
Well, that's totally different,
let's do this!

17:01.191 --> 17:02.852
All right,
at each obstacle,

17:02.852 --> 17:04.404
you're not allowed
to move on

17:04.404 --> 17:06.025
until you answer the question
correctly.

17:06.025 --> 17:10.780
Begin with the Pit of
Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.742
I know saying "sensitive skin"
makes it less scary

17:12.742 --> 17:15.245
but I didn't want you to worry
about your sensitive skin.

17:15.245 --> 17:17.117
And begin!

17:19.499 --> 17:21.501
The Supreme Court case
that established

17:21.501 --> 17:23.423
the right of Congress
to pass laws

17:23.423 --> 17:24.424
that are necessary
and proper.

17:24.424 --> 17:26.426
Gibbons v. Ogden.

17:26.426 --> 17:27.427
Wrong.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.341
Blondes versus Brunettes?

17:31.341 --> 17:33.343
That's wrong
on several counts.

17:41.601 --> 17:43.233
Lochner v. New York.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.395
States can't interfere
with an employee's

17:45.395 --> 17:47.107
right to contract
with an employer.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.358
Correct.
Next challenge.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.241
Hey, I didn't get
to bash him.

17:51.241 --> 17:53.493
You said
I'd get to bash him.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.121
Okay, okay, stop that.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.002
This isn't Whoopsy!

18:03.002 --> 18:04.834
This is like one of those cheap
knock-offs of Whoopsy,

18:04.834 --> 18:09.008
like Whoopso or Oopsy
or Whaaat?

18:09.008 --> 18:12.512
Hold your horses,
you don't like Whaaat?

18:12.512 --> 18:13.593
Next, you'll tell me
you don't like

18:13.593 --> 18:15.595
Hold Your Horses.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.717
Whoa.

18:18.718 --> 18:21.351
Whoopsy.

18:25.435 --> 18:26.646
I need to talk to you.

18:26.646 --> 18:28.488
Oh, good.
I need to talk to you, too.

18:28.488 --> 18:30.190
I miss doing Chloe's hair.

18:30.190 --> 18:32.692
I miss touching it,
and I miss talking to her.

18:32.692 --> 18:34.284
I spent a half an hour
grooming Stan

18:34.284 --> 18:36.866
but he's just not a very good
conversationalist.

18:36.866 --> 18:40.660
"I'm just a big, dumb dog
from Delaware."

18:40.660 --> 18:43.583
Delaware? Where are you even
getting that from?

18:43.583 --> 18:46.666
That's it, tonight,
I'm sleeping on your face.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.591
Honey, I am so relieved
to hear that.

18:51.591 --> 18:53.883
Her hair's gonna
haunt my dreams.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.845
There are things
in there, Ellen.

18:55.845 --> 18:58.718
Angry, bite-y things.

18:58.718 --> 19:02.061
Well, it's for the best
'cause you were really
not very good at it.

19:05.104 --> 19:08.528
My teacher said to tell you
to expect a home visit.

19:10.270 --> 19:11.771
Sweetie,
how would you like

19:11.771 --> 19:13.483
Mommy to go back
to doing your hair?

19:13.483 --> 19:16.656
More than anything.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.778
I mean, nothing personal,
Daddy,

19:18.778 --> 19:22.582
but I look like
a cherry tumbleweed.

19:24.083 --> 19:27.497
I look like
a frightened clown.

19:27.497 --> 19:31.921
I look like an Irish setter
in a wind storm.

19:31.921 --> 19:35.345
I look like a troll doll
that went through the dryer.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.136
I get it, Chloe.

19:37.136 --> 19:39.299
You look like
a red cat's hairball.

19:39.299 --> 19:41.140
Dad, that's offensive.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.805
And this wasn't working
for Snappy either.

19:45.805 --> 19:48.358
He moved out of my hair
and I can't find him anywhere.

19:48.358 --> 19:52.151
Don't worry, sweetie.
I'm sure he'll turn up.

19:58.778 --> 20:00.320
Avery,
I'm in so much pain

20:00.320 --> 20:02.952
from everything
you did today, ow,

20:02.952 --> 20:06.496
to help me study for,
ow, my tests.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.289
But it didn't work.
I give up.

20:09.289 --> 20:11.961
Oh, pork and beans,
this hurts.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.425
I'm so sorry.
I don't know
where I went wrong.

20:15.425 --> 20:17.507
Don't blame--
sweet potato fries-- yourself.

20:19.138 --> 20:21.341
Look, I have to go
practice some bike stunts.

20:21.341 --> 20:23.303
Even if I don't go
on the tour,

20:23.303 --> 20:25.184
maybe someday
I'll get another shot.

20:25.184 --> 20:27.347
How are you gonna
practice bike stunts?
You're in so much pain.

20:27.347 --> 20:28.938
We have to work
through the...

20:31.271 --> 20:33.943
...pain.

20:33.943 --> 20:35.945
BMX isn't always fun,
Avery.

20:35.945 --> 20:38.658
It's a lot of hard work
but it's worth it.

20:38.658 --> 20:41.411
Of course.

20:41.411 --> 20:43.283
I was trying to find
a substitute

20:43.283 --> 20:45.665
for the hard work you need
to be a great student.

20:45.665 --> 20:48.288
But there isn't one.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.420
You just
have to do the work.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.132
Whoa, so was causing me
all this pain

20:53.132 --> 20:55.295
all part of your trick
to teach me this lesson?

20:55.295 --> 20:58.428
Yeah.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.510
Of course.
What else could it be?

21:00.510 --> 21:01.801
The act of
a 14-year-old

21:01.801 --> 21:03.433
trying to invent
an educational model

21:03.433 --> 21:05.224
that never occurred to
educational professionals

21:05.224 --> 21:08.388
over thousands of years?

21:08.388 --> 21:11.561
Look, if you want to learn,
it won't be easy or fun,

21:11.561 --> 21:14.564
but your reward is that
you'll get to pursue
your dream.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.235
I'm gonna do it, Avery.

21:16.235 --> 21:19.739
I'm gonna work my butt off
and make this happen.

21:19.739 --> 21:21.200
I'm proud of you, Tyler.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.032
Oh, chicken chow mein!

21:26.666 --> 21:28.328
Everyone learned
a lot this week.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.370
Bennett learned
that no one wants a calendar

21:30.370 --> 21:32.251
of the twelve hairstyles
of Bennett James.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.045
Hopefully, Ellen
learned something

21:36.045 --> 21:38.047
about what happens
when you inaccurately

21:38.047 --> 21:39.589
imitate a talking dog.

21:42.682 --> 21:44.053
And as for Tyler...

21:44.053 --> 21:47.226
Avery, I didn't pass.

21:47.226 --> 21:48.428
What?
Just kidding.

21:48.428 --> 21:51.230
I passed.
Class clown.

21:51.230 --> 21:53.733
So you passed?
Yes.

21:53.733 --> 21:56.235
I did it.
I did it.

21:56.235 --> 21:59.399
But, you know,
this is just the beginning

21:59.399 --> 22:01.361
now that you're in
the accelerated program.

22:01.361 --> 22:05.284
Wait, I thought the test
was the accelerated program.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.657
I thought I graduated.
No, you're gonna have
to work hard

22:07.657 --> 22:09.208
for the rest of the semester
to get through it.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.912
No!

22:14.213 --> 22:16.836
Hang glide, check.
