00:30.071 --> 00:31.372
I'll get him.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.260
Kirsten?

00:46.379 --> 00:47.481
It's Meg.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.098
The inner ear thing?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.767
The antibiotics didn't...

00:51.342 --> 00:53.988
Well, her doctor won't let her
fly, so she's not coming.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.990
My sister is not
coming to my wedding.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.565
Can you believe that?

00:57.849 --> 00:59.702
She told me I could only
cry for ten minutes

00:59.726 --> 01:01.037
because she couldn't
live with the guilt

01:01.061 --> 01:03.988
if I was all puffy-faced
in our wedding pictures.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.294
Oh! Then Mom called.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.755
And they're running late because
she ripped her stockings.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.423
And she had to pick up a
new pair at Neiman's.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.675
- Kirsten... - I'm just waiting
for the third thing to happen.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.417
Because it always
happens in threes.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.213
God, you look beat. Dudley didn't
keep you up all night, did he?

01:20.455 --> 01:24.268
Oh, and the third thing is
Cheryl, the caterer. You know?

01:24.292 --> 01:25.978
- Kirsten... - There's some
salmon disease going around,

01:26.002 --> 01:27.438
and she's had to
substitute with shrimp.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.231
And Julia's allergic
to shrimp, right?

01:29.255 --> 01:30.681
Could you do this for me?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.200
Charlie.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.451
Charlie.

01:40.475 --> 01:41.901
You're wrinkling me.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.949
I wanna get married.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.118
I wanna marry you.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.670
Well, that's a good thing.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.924
Because 9000 bucks says there's a
wedding in our immediate future.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.125
No. You don't understand.

01:57.575 --> 02:01.013
I've been up all night trying to
figure out what's going on with me,

02:01.037 --> 02:04.600
trying to figure out what
I want and what to do,

02:04.624 --> 02:06.769
and how to tell you what I
wanna do without hurting you,

02:06.793 --> 02:08.803
'cause, God, I don't
wanna hurt you.

02:10.003 --> 02:11.514
I want us to wait.

02:11.756 --> 02:15.017
Can we wait just a few
months, just six months?

02:15.301 --> 02:18.781
Please? Please? I need some
time, just a little time.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.315
Because I don't wanna feel
like this when we do it.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.527
Feel like what?

02:25.019 --> 02:28.040
Like this, panicked and trapped.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.460
My heart is pounding, and there's
this voice inside of my head saying,

02:31.484 --> 02:34.412
"No, no, no, no.
Not now, not now."

02:35.905 --> 02:39.250
I wanna spend the rest of my life
with you, Kirsten. I know that. I do.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.921
Only I'm not ready.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.550
I'm not ready for the rest
of my life to start today.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.798
Come here.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.180
It's okay, Charlie.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.317
- It is?
- Yes.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.142
It's okay.

03:39.093 --> 03:42.239
You probably had too much to drink
at the bachelor party, right?

03:42.263 --> 03:44.992
And you've been up all
night, and you're exhausted.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.234
Yes.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.494
I can tell.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.413
So if you need more
time, take it.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.248
Take a whole half-hour
if you need it.

03:51.272 --> 03:54.825
Just stretch out and
close your eyes, okay?

03:55.443 --> 03:57.171
I'm gonna go downstairs
to take care of...

03:57.195 --> 03:58.829
I don't think you heard what...

03:59.906 --> 04:02.124
It's not a question of a
half an hour, Kirsten.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.762
Well, I don't think we can push
things more than that, Charlie.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.889
They're gonna need us
downstairs for pictures soon.

04:06.913 --> 04:07.932
Kirsten...

04:07.956 --> 04:12.228
I know how crazy sleep deprivation can make
a person. Remember me before my orals?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.147
But it's just me, Charlie.
All we need to do is...

04:15.171 --> 04:18.608
is say how we feel about each
other and make a promise.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.392
And that's not so hard, right?

04:21.427 --> 04:24.272
I know you can do that.
You can do that.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.943
I love you, and
it's gonna be okay.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.156
Oh, promise me
you're gonna shave.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.007
Now I want you to check
all of these, okay.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.332
Okay. All right.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.595
Kirsten. Oh, my God!

04:46.619 --> 04:47.805
Wow!

04:47.829 --> 04:50.089
You look so beautiful.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.475
Do you think the
caterer's ready yet?

04:51.499 --> 04:53.560
The guests will be here any minute.
And where's the photographer?

04:53.584 --> 04:54.853
Out back, setting up.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.512
Okay, I'm gonna go check on him.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.598
I don't want us waiting
on the picture-taking.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.194
Jitters.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.936
Caterer. I'll check.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.107
- Hey, Claud.
- Oh, wow, Ross!

05:08.599 --> 05:09.785
- Look at you.
- Mwah!

05:09.809 --> 05:11.078
Congratulations, you guys.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.621
I'm just saying
that I think maybe

05:12.645 --> 05:14.540
we should start passing around
hors d'oeuvres, that's all.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.250
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.668
We're the first ones here.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.628
We are not the first ones here!
Will you relax?

05:19.652 --> 05:21.078
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.706
What are you wearing, Will?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.541
You like it? See?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.344
I got a lecture
on the ride over.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.389
But I said, "Hey, there's nothing wrong
with showing a sense of personal style."

05:30.413 --> 05:32.141
- Am I right, Bay?
- No, Will, no.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.466
You're not even close.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.853
This is a wedding, not
a golf tournament.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.979
I tried. I'm sorry.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.971
- You're on her side?
- Thank you.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.734
This is a conspiracy. I'm not
talking to you two anymore.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.225
Well, congratulations.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.653
I'm gonna check out
the back yard.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.520
She's driving me crazy.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.899
Same here.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.244
Oh, look at you.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.788
Gene, look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?

05:54.812 --> 05:56.498
The most beautiful.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.416
Hi, Daddy.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.575
- Gorgeous.
- Oh, my God.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.296
Mom, don't start crying over me.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.506
Oh, please. How can I not cry?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.208
I couldn't be more proud if
I'd paid for this myself.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.054
Meggy's just dying that
she couldn't be here.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.639
We thought that she'd feel
better, you know, last night.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.308
Well, you'll just
send her pictures.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.311
Oh, pictures! We gotta get
started on the pictures.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.563
Um, we should round
everybody up.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.273
Where's that groom of yours?

06:21.297 --> 06:23.307
Oh. I'll go get him.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.812
Charlie!

06:28.596 --> 06:30.106
What are you doin'?

06:31.766 --> 06:32.868
What?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.870
Well, you gotta get moving here.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.446
We've got guests. Everyone's
wondering where you are.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.741
You having trouble
with your tie?

06:41.275 --> 06:42.952
Want me to tie it for you?

06:46.697 --> 06:47.925
I'm pretty good at this.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.209
I used to watch Mom
do this for Dad.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.215
You look nervous. You okay?

06:56.582 --> 06:57.684
I don't know.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.644
Yeah.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.096
Guess I can kind of understand that.
Kind of natural.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.848
There.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.148
God, are you handsome, Charlie.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.233
You look so young.

07:17.770 --> 07:21.333
Gonna put this back
here, veil over there.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.160
Flowers... That's fine.
That's good.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.590
Hey! Charlie, would you
look who's finally here.

07:28.614 --> 07:29.550
Hey.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.635
You're holding up the works.
You got pictures to take.

07:31.659 --> 07:35.431
Let's start with the bride and groom
and the bride's family first.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.808
Ellie, you can stand
next to Kirsten.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.217
Gene, next to Charlie.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.012
Good. Everybody's looking great.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.273
Okay.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.024
Let's get a little
closer together.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.485
Don't be shy, Charlie.
She's not gonna bite you.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.269
You're supposed to
be having fun here.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.283
All right, here we go.
You all look wonderful.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.859
Now look at me. Very good.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.945
And a little closer together.
Smile.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.281
Justin.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.492
Uh, I didn't expect...

08:04.525 --> 08:05.752
Yeah, yeah, I know.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.952
Big surprise.

08:07.361 --> 08:10.716
Um, and I'm probably
not gonna stay, so...

08:10.740 --> 08:13.125
Oh, okay.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.796
It's just, my Mom bought
this present, and it's, uh,

08:17.163 --> 08:18.599
kind of breakable, so...

08:18.623 --> 08:21.717
- So here.
- Right. Well, I'll take it.

08:23.085 --> 08:26.514
Anyways, you're welcome to stay.
I mean, you were invited.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.432
That was a while ago.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.611
I figured you'd probably wanna
take back the invitation.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.936
I did not.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.854
Justin...

08:34.679 --> 08:35.981
Well.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.035
I mean, if we were
still friends,

08:39.059 --> 08:42.196
then I'd definitely
be here, so, uh...

08:44.815 --> 08:48.128
My, uh... My Dad's home today.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.538
I don't know, I just needed
to get out of the house.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.040
So maybe I'll just
stay for a little bit.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.376
Okay, great.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.336
Julia.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.796
Come on.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.297
Pictures.

09:00.414 --> 09:01.715
Very good.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.936
Julia, why don't
you hold the baby.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.261
Oh, okay.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.148
- Hey!
- There we go.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.274
Good. Perfect.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.235
There we go. Yeah, please.
Thanks.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.685
Here we go.

09:13.135 --> 09:16.605
And why don't you change
places, Claudia and Julia.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.867
Give Bailey a little room there.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.401
Here we go.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.820
I'll need three
more hours of this.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.541
Okay, this is great. That's it.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.959
A little closer in.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.077
Now everybody say "forever".

09:30.403 --> 09:32.121
"Forever."

09:37.243 --> 09:38.752
Charlie, where are you going?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.379
Charlie, what...?

09:41.289 --> 09:42.307
Where's he going?

09:42.331 --> 09:43.549
I don't know.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.315
Charlie, please stop this.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.609
No. I told you. I told you!

09:52.633 --> 09:54.736
Shh. Everyone will hear.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.321
Listen to me. I can't do this.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.198
Yes. Yes, you can.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.575
Why won't you listen to me?

09:59.599 --> 10:01.118
I am listening to you, Charlie.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.444
What I am not doing
is indulging you.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.664
- What?
- You're scared.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.001
Well, hello. Yes, it's scary.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.043
You're panicked.

10:10.067 --> 10:13.454
Well, who isn't, the morning before
their wedding? But you make a choice.

10:13.738 --> 10:17.301
You either decide that it's second
thoughts, or if you love me, Charlie,

10:17.325 --> 10:20.470
you decide that it's nervous anticipation.
And you go back downstairs with me.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.515
And when the minister asks, "Do you
take this woman?", you say, "I do."

10:23.539 --> 10:26.810
No! No. You don't understand.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.011
I say that, and I am married,

10:29.378 --> 10:31.565
to the last woman that
I'm ever gonna be with,

10:31.589 --> 10:34.308
and I've got all the kids
that I'm ever gonna have.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.771
And I live in my father's house. And
every day I go to my father's job.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.784
And any one of those things on
their own, I can deal with,

10:42.808 --> 10:45.954
but you add them up,
Kirsten, and, I mean, look,

10:45.978 --> 10:48.415
the wife and the kids and
the house and the job.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.501
And that's every decision that
I'm ever gonna make in my life.

10:51.525 --> 10:55.913
I've got no choices left. I'm 25
years old, and I know my whole life.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.583
And it's not what you want?

11:01.243 --> 11:03.671
I'm not who you want?
You don't love me?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.631
I do love you.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.468
I don't want to be with anyone else.
I don't.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.730
You just don't want to marry me?

11:11.754 --> 11:14.473
No, I do. I do. I just...

11:14.590 --> 11:16.985
I just need to sit with
all this for a while.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.071
I know if I had some time...

11:19.095 --> 11:20.729
Listen to me, Charlie.

11:21.013 --> 11:25.202
My parents are downstairs, and
your family and our friends

11:25.226 --> 11:29.822
and... and a minister and... and
35 pounds of Australian shrimp.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.043
Now, you just pull
yourself together, okay.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.920
You take a deep breath and
you put this behind you,

11:34.944 --> 11:36.870
because we are getting
married today.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.540
No.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.877
Kirsten, I...

11:44.036 --> 11:45.587
I can't.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.589
I just...

11:49.333 --> 11:50.759
No.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.156
Like hell you're
canceling the wedding!

12:03.180 --> 12:04.491
Stop it. Yelling at
him isn't the answer.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.243
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Hey, come on, now!

12:06.267 --> 12:08.703
- Gene, I... - Ellie, just stay out of this.
All right?

12:08.727 --> 12:10.455
I mean, what happened? Did
you guys have a fight?

12:10.479 --> 12:11.873
I'm not doing this.
This is private.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.166
This was a private conversation!

12:13.190 --> 12:14.751
- Come on, Charlie.
- The hell it was!

12:14.775 --> 12:16.294
Not with 50 guests
in your living room!

12:16.318 --> 12:19.371
- Where do you think you're going?
- Everyone just stop.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.292
I just wanna...

12:23.701 --> 12:25.637
Let's go into the
other room, hmm?

12:25.661 --> 12:27.514
Gene. Let's just go
into the other room.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.881
It's okay.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.718
Charlie...

12:33.043 --> 12:34.187
Just get out of here.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.480
Are you really calling this off?

12:35.504 --> 12:37.983
- You don't mean it, do you?
- Tell us what's happening.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.235
What the hell are you doing? Do
you know what you're doing here?

12:40.259 --> 12:41.810
Maybe you didn't hear me.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.229
It's not happening. You got it?

12:44.847 --> 12:47.274
I want you all out of here now.
I wanna be left alone.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.832
Okay,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.668
I'm gonna go
downstairs, and, uh,

13:07.411 --> 13:09.264
I'm gonna explain to the
minister what's going on,

13:09.288 --> 13:11.673
and I'm gonna pay
off all the help.

13:12.541 --> 13:13.926
Okay, Charlie?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.322
It's weird.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.439
I haven't done that
in a while, have I?

13:27.681 --> 13:29.274
Cleaned up your mess.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.622
Son of a bitch.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.664
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Gene.

13:34.688 --> 13:37.115
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Gene! You're not helping.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.004
Now, Kirs, he's going
to come around.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.840
I mean, of course he will.
Everybody is downstairs.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.342
Did he at least give
you an explanation?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.594
Did he at least
give you a reason?

13:47.618 --> 13:49.095
What reason could
he possibly have?

13:49.119 --> 13:50.430
A person who calls off a wedding

13:50.454 --> 13:54.633
30 minutes before it's supposed to
begin is not thinking rationally.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.187
- Sometimes if you breathe
into a paper bag... - I need...

13:57.211 --> 13:58.939
Remember when I had
that anxiety attack...

13:58.963 --> 14:00.889
- Could you just...
- Shh!

14:01.590 --> 14:04.528
What, honey? What do you want?
Just tell us. Anything you want.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.603
I need it to be
quiet for a minute,

14:07.388 --> 14:09.147
because there's all this noise.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.402
There's all this noise in
my head, and I can't think.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.073
And I have to figure out
how to keep breathing.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.497
What am I gonna do?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.001
Oh, my God!

14:29.577 --> 14:31.461
What am I gonna do?

14:36.250 --> 14:38.886
I'm trying to figure out
what to say to him,

14:39.169 --> 14:41.064
how to get him to
change his mind.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.932
'Cause he's making
such a huge mistake.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.102
You wanna try out
some arguments on me?

14:48.012 --> 14:49.188
You?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.941
Yeah. You could pretend
we're, like, friends.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.028
Nah, it's okay.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.948
Oh, wait.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.783
Don't go.

15:02.192 --> 15:06.246
Just sit here with me for
a little while, okay?

15:07.698 --> 15:08.832
Okay.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.849
Okay, okay, 75 cents on the dollar.
How's that?

15:15.873 --> 15:16.933
What are you doing?

15:16.957 --> 15:20.562
Okay, the best I can do is
knock off $200 from the bill.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.887
That's it.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.680
Keep the shrimp.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.141
Shrimp don't travel.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.851
You're not leaving.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.853
She is not leaving, Bailey.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.690
Uh, yeah, Ellie, she kind of is.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.077
Weren't you upstairs? Didn't
you get what's going on?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.454
- The wedding's off.
- No, no.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.581
No, no, the wedding is not off.
It's not.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.957
It's been delayed. That is all.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.752
We're gonna give Charlie a few
minutes to pull himself together,

15:43.776 --> 15:46.787
and then everything, everything
will go on as planned.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.467
Now, I think they could use some
more of those delicious canapés

15:50.491 --> 15:52.334
in the living room, dear, hmm?

15:53.827 --> 15:56.463
It is not over yet.

16:09.301 --> 16:13.772
I've been sitting outside for,
like, the last ten minutes.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.081
I've got all these arguments
I wanna make to you,

16:21.105 --> 16:23.667
these great arguments, but I...

16:23.691 --> 16:24.626
Julia.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.285
Please don't do this, Charlie.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.621
- Please?
- What are you doing?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.415
I don't know.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.303
I guess I'm begging you 'cause
I don't know what else to say.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.339
'Cause I don't understand
what you're doing.

16:39.790 --> 16:43.468
Nobody does. Nobody
understands, Charlie.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.304
I can't.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.475
This is such a terrible
thing you're doing.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.312
You don't think I
know that, Julia?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.742
Do you think I would do this to
someone that I love that much

16:57.766 --> 16:59.609
if I could figure out any way?

17:00.352 --> 17:02.946
Just any way.

17:05.273 --> 17:06.575
God, Charlie.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.626
Well?

17:17.786 --> 17:20.756
God! So that's it?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.299
That's it.

17:22.790 --> 17:23.967
Wow.

17:24.417 --> 17:25.686
So, what happens now?

17:25.711 --> 17:29.357
Now? I don't know. I guess
everything goes back,

17:29.381 --> 17:31.234
you know, all the presents
and guests and in-laws

17:31.258 --> 17:34.644
and food and all that liquor.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.981
- Too bad.
- Hey, Justin.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.167
She's feeling a little better.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.960
Good, good.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.462
I brought you
something, pumpkin.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.287
No, nothing, really.

17:53.197 --> 17:56.760
I don't know. Maybe we could
do this in a few months.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.428
You know, much smaller, no fuss.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.804
You know, maybe
it would be okay.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.181
Maybe Charlie would
be okay by then.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.140
Kirsten...

18:02.164 --> 18:04.257
But what if he isn't?
What if he's never okay?

18:04.583 --> 18:05.518
On the other hand...

18:05.542 --> 18:07.312
Listen to me. Listen to me.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.980
- Now, are you listening?
- Yes.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.356
Do you want this
wedding to happen?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.682
Do you still want this
wedding to happen?

18:12.883 --> 18:14.194
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.602
Ellie, what are you doing?

18:15.677 --> 18:19.032
You forget about three months from
now or four months or six months

18:19.056 --> 18:22.368
because today is
your wedding day.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.735
Mom, come on.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.497
Don't you let him play his game.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.989
You tell Charlie, "This is it."

18:28.023 --> 18:31.326
You give him one chance
to keep you, one chance,

18:31.401 --> 18:33.671
and after that minister
walks out the door today,

18:33.695 --> 18:34.913
it's over.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.165
Either you're married,
or you're gone.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.252
I can't. What if he says no?

18:41.537 --> 18:42.712
Baby.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.841
He's already said no.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.650
Mmm!

18:53.674 --> 18:57.894
I probably should have eaten something,
because I feel kind of funny.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.771
Funny like bad?

19:02.474 --> 19:05.652
Wow, 1991 was an excellent year.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.989
Mmm.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.741
You, uh, realize, don't you,

19:12.067 --> 19:15.078
that this is a very
historic site?

19:15.863 --> 19:18.341
This is the scene of
our very first kiss.

19:18.365 --> 19:19.833
- Was not.
- Yes.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.335
Uh, we were playing
Hide and Seek,

19:22.536 --> 19:25.714
and you got stuck in the dryer.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.009
Come on. You remember
this, don't you?

19:29.668 --> 19:31.219
Where was it?

19:31.920 --> 19:33.138
Um...

19:34.339 --> 19:36.975
I think we were somewhere
over by the sink.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.655
No, I mean the kiss. Was it
on my cheek or was it...?

19:40.679 --> 19:41.813
Oh.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.857
I think it was, uh,

19:45.225 --> 19:46.818
something like...

19:48.854 --> 19:50.197
that.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.578
Just for the record, it
was under the stairs.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.708
- Hello!
- Hi.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.679
I was trying to figure out
something to say to you,

20:04.703 --> 20:06.630
something helpful.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.967
All I could think of is "Oye".

20:14.129 --> 20:16.264
That pretty much sums it up.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.517
- Oye.
- Yeah.

20:19.384 --> 20:23.104
Well, I'm starting to think that I
should have expected it to go this way.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.981
What's that supposed to mean?

20:25.682 --> 20:29.486
Turns out all the Salinger
men make the same mistake.

20:30.854 --> 20:32.197
What mistake?

20:35.525 --> 20:37.160
They, um...

20:38.570 --> 20:41.957
They walk away
from the one thing

20:42.157 --> 20:44.543
that is actually the best
thing in their whole life.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.463
Really?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.051
I don't know what to say.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.679
Well,

20:56.880 --> 20:59.558
he's gonna be sorry, some day.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.937
And he's gonna wanna take
it all back, you know,

21:05.222 --> 21:06.815
and try again,

21:07.182 --> 21:08.942
but it will probably
be too late.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.236
Probably.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.865
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.452
You're thinking, "How can
anyone be so stupid?", right?

21:20.529 --> 21:21.788
Bailey.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.707
It beats me, Sarah.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.961
It beats the hell out of me.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.016
Could everyone just leave me...?

21:47.681 --> 21:48.857
Hey.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.571
Are you...

21:56.023 --> 22:00.910
I wanna ask you if you're
okay, but you're not.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.080
I mean, obviously,
you're not okay.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.082
Right. Obviously.

22:07.701 --> 22:09.169
And, uh,

22:10.495 --> 22:13.465
I wanna touch you

22:14.541 --> 22:16.593
or hold you or something, but...

22:18.337 --> 22:19.971
I don't know. I mean...

22:20.672 --> 22:22.223
can I do that?

22:23.592 --> 22:25.352
Just let me get
through this, okay?

22:26.970 --> 22:28.740
I heard everything
you said, Charlie.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.357
Really, I did.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.902
But I can't wait,

22:35.228 --> 22:37.040
because nothing's gonna change,

22:37.064 --> 22:39.240
and I know that six
months from now,

22:40.192 --> 22:43.286
we're gonna be in exactly the
same place as we are right now.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.832
And I don't ever wanna
be in this place again.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.669
So here's what it
comes down to for me.

22:55.415 --> 23:00.845
Either you love me enough to
marry me today, right now,

23:02.589 --> 23:04.349
or we split up.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.356
So that's it, I guess.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.237
Now or never.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.461
I did it.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.703
I gave him an ultimatum,
today or never.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.080
You did?

23:27.405 --> 23:29.040
I told him to think about it.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.709
Not to take too long,
but to think about it.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.254
- I feel better.
- Aw.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.173
Hello?

23:37.290 --> 23:38.425
Charlie?

23:38.458 --> 23:39.685
Charlie, are you in there?

23:39.709 --> 23:41.261
I'm coming.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.525
- Is Charlie in here?
- No. What's going on?

23:45.549 --> 23:47.235
He's not in his room.
His car's gone.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.362
Nobody knows anything.
Nobody saw him leave.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.530
He's missing.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.272
I don't know what the
hell's going on.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.402
Rumor in the back yard is
that Charlie's missing.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.413
Yeah. That's the rumor
in the kitchen too.

23:59.437 --> 24:02.365
Apparently the odds on no
wedding have shot to 12-1.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.293
Too weird.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.211
Yeah.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.587
I mean, it really
makes you think.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.423
I mean, you never know what's
gonna happen to anybody.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.758
It's all a mystery, you know?

24:10.782 --> 24:15.420
I mean, two people look like a happy
couple and then boom, it's over.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.306
And two others look
a little shaky,

24:17.330 --> 24:19.591
and it's, you know...
It's happily-ever-after.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.302
I mean, you can just never
tell with relationships.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.387
Is that what you were thinking?

24:26.214 --> 24:27.640
More or less.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.435
Like, for example, with us.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.697
- With us?
- Yeah.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.448
I mean, are you gonna
look back on this

24:34.472 --> 24:37.734
and say, "Oh, yeah, Sarah.
She was, um, kind of nice.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.904
I dated her between... Who was it?
Betsy and Lucy"?

24:41.396 --> 24:44.657
You know, are you gonna say that
she's the one that really mattered?

24:44.774 --> 24:47.410
You know? I mean, maybe
even "She was the one."

24:48.486 --> 24:50.464
- Are you asking me...?
- No! No.

24:50.488 --> 24:52.049
Because we've only been
dating, like, three weeks.

24:52.073 --> 24:55.761
I know! We couldn't possibly
know what we mean to each other.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.931
It's very hard to know. Usually.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.257
I mean, that's my point.
You never know.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.134
It's just food for thought.

25:07.547 --> 25:11.861
Gone? Really gone,
as in disappeared?

25:11.885 --> 25:14.405
That's what I said.
What's wrong with you?

25:14.429 --> 25:16.908
You look like somebody thwacked
you on the back of the head.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.901
Oh, well, it's upsetting news.
I'm upset...

25:20.727 --> 25:22.622
And I have the hiccups.

25:22.646 --> 25:25.406
I have the hiccups,
and I'm upset, okay?

25:26.650 --> 25:29.118
Hey, don't you wanna show me
that thing in your room now?

25:29.319 --> 25:30.537
That thing?

25:30.946 --> 25:33.164
Oh! Right. That thing.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.923
Fresh makeup, huh?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.178
Yeah. So much for non-smudge.

25:48.004 --> 25:51.224
So, does this mean you
think he's coming back?

25:53.093 --> 25:54.686
I don't know, Claudia.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.188
I think he's coming back.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.692
He just went somewhere to
figure everything out.

26:02.435 --> 26:03.871
If he comes home,

26:03.895 --> 26:05.613
will it be okay?

26:07.857 --> 26:09.534
I want it to be okay.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.663
Because I love you and Charlie,
and I want you to be together.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.676
And I want you to
sleep in their room,

26:16.700 --> 26:19.836
and I want you both
to be here every day.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.089
I don't think he's coming
back in time, Claud.

26:28.586 --> 26:32.233
Under the circumstances, is it,
like, inappropriate for me to say

26:32.257 --> 26:34.684
this is the best shrimp I've
ever eaten in my entire life?

26:39.097 --> 26:41.024
No word from Charlie yet, huh?

26:47.105 --> 26:49.657
- Will?
- Yeah?

26:52.444 --> 26:54.078
Do you love her, man?

26:54.362 --> 26:57.498
What? Who? Sarah?

26:57.574 --> 26:59.334
I mean, do you really love her?

27:01.661 --> 27:03.264
What's going on here, Bay?

27:03.288 --> 27:06.684
Because between you and her, I'm feeling
put on the spot all of a sudden.

27:06.708 --> 27:08.134
Do I love her?

27:08.585 --> 27:10.303
I'm definitely into her.

27:10.587 --> 27:12.898
I mean, we're not about
to buy real estate

27:12.922 --> 27:14.442
or major appliances
together or anything.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.017
Because I think I could.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.353
Love her.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.857
I mean, I think I do.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.943
You... you think you love her?

27:26.978 --> 27:28.196
So...

27:28.897 --> 27:30.865
So just tell me that
you're in love with her.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.533
Tell me that...

27:33.109 --> 27:36.746
That you think you need her and that
maybe she'll change your whole life.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.051
And then... Well, okay, then.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.835
Then that's it. I
can live with that.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.838
Just tell me.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.842
Justin.

27:50.001 --> 27:51.803
Is the ceiling
spinning over there?

27:53.505 --> 27:55.431
- Nope.
- Hmm.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.610
'Cause it's spinning over here.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.852
Come look.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.065
Ow.

28:04.766 --> 28:05.993
You see?

28:06.017 --> 28:07.860
Round and round.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.865
Maybe the whole house will come
unscrewed like a giant light bulb.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.038
Mmm, make it stop,
Justin, would you?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.294
How's that?

28:26.413 --> 28:27.755
Better.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.720
Now you're spinning.

28:36.339 --> 28:37.765
Yes, I am.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.250
Do you have something?

28:54.274 --> 28:55.700
In my wallet.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.378
How long has it been in there?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.546
Not that long.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.663
- Justin...
- Really, really.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.499
Just since right before
we weren't in love.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.169
Okay, then.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.019
Uh, hi.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.188
Hello. I...

29:25.930 --> 29:28.024
Everyone? Could I just...?

29:29.434 --> 29:30.943
Hi.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.572
This is really...

29:35.815 --> 29:39.160
Well, embarrassing
is what it is.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.621
Um...

29:43.656 --> 29:45.124
I love a lot of you.

29:45.909 --> 29:49.087
And... a lot of you I
don't know very well.

29:49.245 --> 29:52.757
But I know how much
you mean to Charlie,

29:53.458 --> 29:55.853
and I'm sure if he were here,

29:55.877 --> 29:57.470
he'd...

29:58.880 --> 30:00.556
He'd...

30:03.051 --> 30:07.021
Well, I guess I'm really not the
best person to say what he would do.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.273
Um...

30:10.225 --> 30:12.985
But I wanted to say thank you

30:13.770 --> 30:17.124
for getting all dressed
up and coming over here

30:17.148 --> 30:20.118
and wanting to share
this with us.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.246
But it's not gonna happen.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.749
It's just not.

30:28.034 --> 30:32.088
And I think the best thing to
do is for us to just call...

30:35.625 --> 30:36.968
Can we, uh...?

30:38.044 --> 30:41.139
Just give us a
second, would you?

30:47.095 --> 30:48.656
Charlie, where have you been?

30:48.680 --> 30:51.742
Nowhere. Just driving.

30:51.766 --> 30:55.403
Just driving and thinking and
trying to figure it all out.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.530
And okay.

30:59.232 --> 31:00.533
Okay?

31:01.234 --> 31:04.245
I love you, and I'm sorry.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.623
And, yeah. Yes.
I'm saying "yes".

31:08.074 --> 31:11.178
Because saying no is pretty
much saying goodbye, right?

31:11.202 --> 31:13.337
And I don't want that, Kirsten.
I don't.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.381
So...

31:16.666 --> 31:18.384
So let's do it, okay?

31:18.835 --> 31:20.428
Let's just do it.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.281
What are we gonna do about this?

31:30.305 --> 31:31.365
About what?

31:31.389 --> 31:33.659
About the fact that twice
in the last half-hour,

31:33.683 --> 31:36.694
I was asked how exactly I
see my future with you.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.039
You asked him that?

31:39.063 --> 31:40.875
I'm starting to get a
little pissed off.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.752
But just for the record, are
you dumping me for this jerk?

31:43.776 --> 31:44.753
No!

31:44.777 --> 31:46.046
- Are you taking her back?
- No!

31:46.070 --> 31:47.214
That's not his decision.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.049
Right. That's not my decision.

31:49.073 --> 31:52.251
Besides, you are my best friend,
Will, and I would never...

31:52.952 --> 31:54.471
On the other hand, I
have these feelings.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.640
Which is why I asked you
before I did anything.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.132
You asked him?

31:58.374 --> 31:59.310
He's my best friend.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.103
I am not a piece
of property here.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.104
Right!

32:02.128 --> 32:03.439
You had plenty of chances.

32:03.463 --> 32:05.357
- And he's great.
- I know he's great.

32:05.381 --> 32:08.277
I thought he was great before you
thought he was great and same with her.

32:08.301 --> 32:09.445
But that's not the point.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.739
I know. How I feel about
her is not the point.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.073
Or how I felt about you.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.326
- Felt?
- Feel, okay? Whatever.

32:15.350 --> 32:19.663
The point is, is that you care about
her, and she cares about you,

32:19.687 --> 32:23.199
and I care about you, even
though I really care about her.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.119
So now what?

32:34.285 --> 32:36.045
Oh, my God.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.548
Oh, my God.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.769
Oh, my God!

32:41.793 --> 32:43.437
Don't come in. I mean it.
Don't come in.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.980
I can't come in. It's locked.

32:45.004 --> 32:46.148
Why is it locked?

32:46.172 --> 32:48.025
Because... Because...

32:48.049 --> 32:49.318
You're taking a nap.

32:49.342 --> 32:52.196
'Cause I was taking a nap.
I was taking a nap?

32:52.220 --> 32:53.280
You were taking a nap?

32:53.304 --> 32:54.698
Claudia, what do you want?

32:54.722 --> 32:56.575
Charlie just showed up and
the wedding's back on,

32:56.599 --> 32:57.993
so hurry up and get downstairs.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.411
Oh, my God!

32:59.435 --> 33:00.663
Oh, my God.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.280
Oh, my God.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.624
I'll go check on her.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.596
Kirsten, what are you...?

33:28.339 --> 33:29.890
Everyone's ready.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.604
Kirsten...

33:40.059 --> 33:42.737
I would have given you
everything I have today.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.241
God, Charlie. I would
have given you me.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.621
I can't give you any more than that.
I don't know how.

33:53.239 --> 33:56.459
And if that's not enough,
if you're not sure...

33:56.534 --> 33:58.971
I'm sure. I'm sure.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.546
No.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.798
You're not.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.688
And I'm sorry, but there are some things
you say you just can't take back.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.264
So I made a mistake.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.152
Kirsten, please don't do this to me.
Please.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.643
What do you want me to do?

34:15.428 --> 34:17.605
I'm afraid to marry you.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.909
I'm afraid of the day you're
gonna walk in that door

34:21.934 --> 34:23.746
and say, "I don't
want you anymore."

34:23.770 --> 34:25.121
I won't say that.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.697
I don't believe you.

34:30.025 --> 34:33.454
I love you, but I
don't believe you.

34:34.112 --> 34:36.248
And I can't take that chance

34:36.616 --> 34:38.793
because I would die, Charlie.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.469
So I'm gonna walk away from you

34:50.670 --> 34:53.431
and from these
children who I love.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.400
Thanks.

35:02.558 --> 35:03.901
Bye.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.407
Here.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.992
Bye, Joe.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.495
See you, kid.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.293
All in all,

35:21.452 --> 35:22.878
I'd have to say,

35:23.913 --> 35:25.297
not a good day.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.550
Yep.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.510
One for the record books.

35:29.710 --> 35:31.939
Putting aside the whole
wedding thing for a sec,

35:31.963 --> 35:34.723
I got this mambo cigar
burn on my new jacket,

35:35.091 --> 35:37.569
turns out you're still
hung up on my girlfriend,

35:37.593 --> 35:39.603
my girlfriend's still
hung up on you,

35:39.846 --> 35:41.856
and, uh... Oh, and the shrimp.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.743
I take back what I said before.
It's repeating on me.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.078
Big time.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.486
She is?

35:47.645 --> 35:49.071
She said that? Sarah?

35:49.105 --> 35:50.124
No.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.460
What she said was, "You're the
nicest guy in the world, Will,"

35:53.484 --> 35:56.579
and I sort of cut her off right there
'cause I knew where she was headed.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.666
Okay.

36:01.033 --> 36:02.501
Here's how I figure it.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.628
We've known each other how long?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.348
I don't know, ten years?

36:06.372 --> 36:09.008
And sooner or later we were
gonna fall for the same girl.

36:09.250 --> 36:13.137
And I guess I can make a big stink
about it and tell you to go to hell,

36:13.713 --> 36:15.848
but then I'd be out a girlfriend

36:16.257 --> 36:17.892
and a best friend.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.770
And that'd be pretty dumb.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.111
Anyway, I think the
lesson of the day is,

36:29.353 --> 36:30.988
what's meant to be
is meant to be.

36:32.690 --> 36:36.035
And you guys, you and Sarah,

36:36.569 --> 36:38.037
you just are.

36:43.284 --> 36:46.045
- Will...
- Oh, and one more thing.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.766
I'm sorry, man. I'm
sorry about that.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.510
I kind of had to, you know?
As a guy.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.053
I...

36:55.046 --> 36:56.847
...totally understand.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.645
She's in the back yard.

37:07.516 --> 37:12.530
I don't know whether to be really
pissed off at you or apologize.

37:15.024 --> 37:19.087
Well, it doesn't have to be
somebody's fault, you know?

37:19.111 --> 37:20.371
I mean, uh,

37:20.571 --> 37:23.175
Or even a mistake.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.176
No.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.385
Right.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.304
Stuff just happens.

37:27.328 --> 37:29.223
You get married or you don't.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.883
You save yourself for when it's special,
or you just get drunk and do it.

37:33.292 --> 37:34.885
Same difference, right?

37:36.337 --> 37:39.014
No. Of course not.

37:41.008 --> 37:42.893
I wanted it to be special.

37:44.387 --> 37:47.147
I'm not saying it has to
be the one person ever,

37:47.723 --> 37:49.952
but it'd be nice.

37:49.976 --> 37:54.456
I mean, it'd be nice
right after it happens

37:54.480 --> 37:57.783
to look at that person and
say, "You could be the one."

37:59.986 --> 38:01.912
Or at least a friend.

38:03.072 --> 38:07.543
At least someone you love, who kind
of feels the same way about you.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.296
Then it'd be okay.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.593
Then it'd be nice.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.944
Oh, never wear new
shoes to an event

38:23.968 --> 38:25.728
that lasts longer
than three hours.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.323
I was thinking,

38:39.066 --> 38:40.701
when we were together before,

38:41.527 --> 38:42.870
it was too soon.

38:43.362 --> 38:44.705
And then,

38:45.656 --> 38:49.585
when you were with Will,
it was kind of too late.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.588
So now...

38:53.331 --> 38:56.216
maybe now it's just...

38:57.626 --> 38:59.303
I don't know. Right.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.350
'Cause I feel like
I'm ready for this.

39:04.425 --> 39:07.394
I mean, I am ready.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.401
Do you wanna borrow
a jacket or...?

39:14.852 --> 39:15.787
No.

39:15.811 --> 39:17.404
Sarah, you're shivering.

39:18.647 --> 39:19.865
Yeah.

39:20.608 --> 39:24.203
I know. Isn't that funny?
I don't feel cold at all.

40:07.655 --> 40:10.217
I'll probably be in Chicago
with my folks for about a week

40:10.241 --> 40:12.042
and then come back and
look for a place.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.712
I'll call and let you know.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.171
Right.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.017
We'll figure out a time for
me to pick up my stuff.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.143
Can we slow down for a minute?

40:20.167 --> 40:21.061
No.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.638
And if there are any questions,
um, we can figure it out then.

40:25.172 --> 40:26.566
Or you can take what you want.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.567
Kirsten...

40:27.591 --> 40:28.693
Oh, and, um...

40:28.717 --> 40:32.604
Owen has a pediatrician's
appointment on Tuesday.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.698
This should stay in the
family, your Mom's ring.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.743
For Julia.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.455
Or you, I guess.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.506
Damn, I can't. Can you help me?

41:00.791 --> 41:02.217
No.

41:03.502 --> 41:04.928
No.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.733
I love you.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.486
I love you too.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.367
Maybe if we're both lucky
that'll go away a little.

41:39.455 --> 41:42.716
Whose bright idea was it to pay off the
caterers before they finished cleaning?

41:43.292 --> 41:44.895
I'll give you 50 bucks, Claud...

41:44.919 --> 41:46.271
I think Charlie should do it.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.138
This whole thing is his fault.

41:48.380 --> 41:49.890
I could get behind that.

41:52.426 --> 41:53.685
I don't get it.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.396
I mean, do you get
why he did it, Bay?

41:56.597 --> 41:57.981
He loves her.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.276
I really think he loves
her, doesn't he?

42:06.023 --> 42:07.449
Yeah.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.409
Yeah, Claud, he loves her.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.456
Okay, look.

42:15.074 --> 42:18.627
Why don't we just deal with the
cleanup in the morning, okay?

42:20.287 --> 42:21.640
What are you doing there, Claud?

42:21.664 --> 42:23.215
Saving the top.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.426
You're supposed
to for good luck.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.849
Maybe they'll
change their minds.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.271
Just help me make room
in the freezer, okay?

42:37.638 --> 42:38.856
Okay.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.617
Have you eaten anything?

42:51.443 --> 42:53.245
'Cause there's lots of stuff.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.664
Not hungry.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.588
What are you gonna do, Charlie?

43:04.081 --> 43:05.424
You think I know?

43:05.833 --> 43:07.384
Think I've got a clue?

43:07.626 --> 43:10.313
It's only been, what,
six hours and you...

43:10.337 --> 43:13.858
No. I mean, tonight. Right now.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.934
What are you gonna do?
You just gonna sit here?

43:18.053 --> 43:19.354
Yeah.

43:22.057 --> 43:25.328
Look, I know what you're doing
here, Bailey, so just go ahead.

43:25.352 --> 43:26.695
Get it over with.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.655
Get what over?

43:28.814 --> 43:30.041
You know.

43:30.065 --> 43:31.617
The lecture.

43:32.651 --> 43:34.786
Just really let me have it.
Tear me apart.

43:35.154 --> 43:37.465
Tell me how I've
lost her for good.

43:37.489 --> 43:39.050
Tell me how I've
let you all down.

43:39.074 --> 43:41.418
Tell me how I just
ruined my life.

43:43.537 --> 43:44.713
Nah.

43:47.499 --> 43:49.019
You're gonna hear that
from a lot of people

43:49.043 --> 43:50.886
so you don't need
to hear it from me.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.648
I don't always get you, Charlie.

44:04.433 --> 44:06.276
Sometimes you do things I...

44:08.729 --> 44:10.614
Well, I just don't get you.

44:12.691 --> 44:15.744
But you know what? I'm
gonna love you, anyway,

44:16.654 --> 44:17.955
because you're my brother.

44:20.157 --> 44:22.376
And I think you could use
someone on your side.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.170
So that's me.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.298
I'm on your side.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.396
How about I just sit with
you for a while, huh?
