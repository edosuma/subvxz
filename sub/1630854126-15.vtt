00:02.393 --> 00:03.699
Greetings
and saaaaluuutations--

00:03.699 --> 00:05.048
Not today, Jacob.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.832
This morning is already
on my last nerve.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.399
I tried to take a picture of
this woman's crooked lace front,

00:08.399 --> 00:10.227
dropped my phone,
cracked it.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.055
I asked her to pay for it, she
said she gonna call the cops.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.970
I am
one minor inconvenience

00:13.970 --> 00:15.276
from putting this whole day
in rice.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.408
Oh, been there.
Sort of.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.932
Well, let me improve your day
with a tasty offering.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.151
I made carrot cookies.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.371
You mean carrot cake?
As if.

00:23.371 --> 00:26.113
Carrot cookies-- made with
carrots and carrot juice.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.854
Mnh, no,
just looking at them

00:28.854 --> 00:29.986
almost put me
over the top.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.422
- Janine? Can I tempt you?
- Yeah.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.207
They're made with
salvaged oat pulp.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.686
Those look alive.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.253
Well, yeah.
That's the probiotics.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.733
Uh, you know what?

00:37.733 --> 00:39.256
I probably shouldn't
on an empty stomach, so...

00:41.606 --> 00:43.086
I didn't know we were
having a fire drill today.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.392
Was it on the schedule?

00:44.392 --> 00:46.089
I have it memorized,
and no. Oh.

00:46.089 --> 00:49.266
Single-file line,
most flammable kids first,

00:49.266 --> 00:51.138
and remember--
no running!

00:51.138 --> 00:52.574
Everybody out!

00:52.574 --> 00:54.141
This is a real fire
in the teachers' lounge!

00:54.141 --> 00:56.012
This is a real fire!
This is not a drill! Hootie-hoo!

00:56.012 --> 00:57.579
Wait, Ava, where
- are you going?!
- I'm protecting my peace.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.755
The firefighters are almost
here. Y'all got it!

00:59.755 --> 01:01.931
- Okay, real fire.
- Um, okay, um...

01:01.931 --> 01:03.628
A-Alright, two,
- three, four, five.
- You guys up.
Turn that way.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.588
Alright, y'all,
- come out safely.
- Alright, guys.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.068
Right there.
Get the door.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.461
- Do not go into the street.
- Go, go, go, go. Go.

01:10.461 --> 01:11.767
She's not coming back,
is she?

01:11.767 --> 01:13.377
No.
Alright, guys. Okay.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.740
Jacob, you know
I love you, I do.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.046
But did your cookies
do this?

01:30.046 --> 01:31.830
No, these are no-bakes.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.050
It's better for
the environment and your gut.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.008
What is wrong
with you?
- Ugh.
- Oh, disgusting.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.141
Okay, I can tell you,
<i>I</i> didn't do this.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.491
Because as someone who wanted
to be a firefighter,

01:40.491 --> 01:41.492
I hate fires.

01:41.492 --> 01:42.493
They sicken me.

01:42.493 --> 01:43.929
I want to fight them.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.018
Smoke and fire--
the devil's fresh air.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.759
It was probably
shoddy wiring.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.152
- Yeah.
- Good morning, everyone.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.632
I'm Captain Robinson.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.634
No relation to Smokey,
so save your jokes.

01:52.634 --> 01:53.635
I've heard them all.

01:53.635 --> 01:54.897
Hm.

01:54.897 --> 01:55.854
I'd like to speak
to your principal.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.683
Oh, well, that's--
that's great

01:58.683 --> 02:00.337
because, actually,
she just posted a video.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.339
She's probably on her way
back to Abbott.

02:02.339 --> 02:03.949
<i>All my preppers know
what time it is.</i>

02:03.949 --> 02:05.603
<i>Let's get into this.</i>

02:05.603 --> 02:07.344
<i>"What's In My Go Bag:
Fire Safety Edition."</i>

02:07.344 --> 02:09.216
<i>First up-- matches.</i>

02:09.216 --> 02:12.044
<i>'Cause one thing about me,
I'mma fight fire with fire.</i>

02:12.044 --> 02:14.264
- Alright.
- Our principal
is otherwise engaged.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.265
But I'm happy
to fill in for her.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.658
How can I help you?

02:16.658 --> 02:18.094
I took a series
of catastrophe modules

02:18.094 --> 02:19.878
in my principal training.

02:19.878 --> 02:22.011
I'm also prepared for tidal
waves, Facebook crashing--

02:22.011 --> 02:24.535
that's for the older teachers--
and a lice outbreak...

02:24.535 --> 02:26.276
for the white teachers.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.539
Looks like the fire
was started by a candle

02:28.539 --> 02:30.150
and this nearby shawl.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.934
Classic case of
flame meets fabric.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.197
Wait, but that's
Barbara's shawl

02:34.197 --> 02:36.199
and Barbara's candle.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.896
Oh, my God,
someone's trying to use

02:37.896 --> 02:39.898
cashmere and Jesus
to blackmail Barbara.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.900
- You mean "frame".
- Semantics.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.207
I did step out earlier
to take a phone call.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.731
And maybe a gust
from the vent

02:46.731 --> 02:49.734
just blew my shawl
over the candle.

02:49.734 --> 02:52.084
I take full responsibility.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.738
Well, let's hope
it doesn't happen again.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.000
Luckily, no one was hurt.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.219
But we're still
gonna have to go

02:56.219 --> 02:58.395
through the standard
post-fire protocols.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.223
Of course,
I'm happy to sidebar.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.746
I still can't believe

03:01.746 --> 03:04.619
they brought
a tractor drawn aerial.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.838
Yeah, that's--
that's one big daddy.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.320
I am sorry
for the inconvenience.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.235
But if there's any way
that I can help,

03:12.235 --> 03:14.237
please let me know.

03:14.237 --> 03:17.327
I lost three precious diamonds
in the fire. And a Ferrari.

03:17.327 --> 03:18.676
Not sure if
the time is right,

03:18.676 --> 03:20.374
but I think we
should talk insurance.

03:23.246 --> 03:26.031
We all behaved
as kings and queens.

03:26.031 --> 03:29.252
I took my line-leader duties
very seriously.
Cool, cool.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.601
Okay, now, everyone,
drop your bags.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.907
Zip those coats back up.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.387
We're going on
an impromptu excursion.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.692
What's an excursion?

03:34.692 --> 03:36.128
That's where
youse all work those

03:36.128 --> 03:37.608
cute little
puppy dog eyes

03:37.608 --> 03:40.045
to get the firefighters
to let us play on the truck.

03:40.045 --> 03:42.309
- Cool!
- Come on!

03:44.180 --> 03:46.313
The fire department sent a TDA.

03:46.313 --> 03:49.403
That's industry speak for
"tractor drawn aerial."

03:49.403 --> 03:51.448
And for me,
that's top of the line.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.276
That's the one my uncle
used to drive.

03:53.276 --> 03:57.149
The Schemmentis have a rich
history in firefighting...

03:57.149 --> 03:58.412
also fighting fighting.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.544
Wow.

04:00.544 --> 04:06.637
Would you look at this
big... hunk... of... metal.

04:06.637 --> 04:08.465
See, this is why
I love fire trucks.

04:08.465 --> 04:11.338
I get older--
they stay the same.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.296
Nothing beats
fire engine red.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.906
Come on in, guys. Hi.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.473
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.301
I'm Janet Elton, trauma
counselor sent by the district.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.651
I'm looking for
acting-principal Gregory Eddie.

04:20.651 --> 04:21.826
- Oh.
- Interim principal.

04:21.826 --> 04:22.871
Unofficially,
but effectively.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.481
Thank you for coming.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.396
Wow,
you called the district

04:26.396 --> 04:28.224
and they actually
sent someone right away?

04:28.224 --> 04:29.704
Well, people really
respect my leadershi--

04:29.704 --> 04:31.401
I was on my way
when you called.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.750
Where can I set up?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.491
I need to work my way
top to bottom

04:34.491 --> 04:37.015
and visit all classrooms ahead
of the fire safety meeting.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.235
Oh, lucky.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.063
Ask the third graders
if they miss me.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.283
Right this way.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.156
I'm Miss Teagues.

04:47.156 --> 04:49.201
It's normal
to be shaken up.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.855
I'll be here for
the rest of the day

04:50.855 --> 04:53.075
should any of you want to talk
about today's events.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.251
That's teachers
and students alike.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.688
Mm.
My metaphorical
door is open.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.343
Thank you, Miss Janet.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.693
As I always say, "When in doubt,
talk it out."

05:02.693 --> 05:04.652
Right, guys?

05:04.652 --> 05:06.697
Can I offer you
a carrot cookie

05:06.697 --> 05:08.569
for your
Abbott journey?

05:08.569 --> 05:10.092
It's late morning,
and the container

05:10.092 --> 05:11.702
is still
completely full.

05:11.702 --> 05:12.790
I'll pass.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.837
I will keep
a close eye on them,

05:15.837 --> 05:18.056
and if any of the students
express any concern,

05:18.056 --> 05:19.971
I will be sure
to let you know.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.887
And how are you holding up,
Mrs. Howard?

05:22.887 --> 05:24.324
Me?

05:24.324 --> 05:26.282
Oh, I'm just fine.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.545
I lit a candle, then
I received a phone call,

05:28.545 --> 05:31.722
and because I am a courteous
person, I answered it.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.245
And--

05:33.245 --> 05:35.552
You know, this is just
much ado about nothing.

05:35.552 --> 05:36.640
I'm fine.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.166
Are you
writing I'm fine?

05:41.166 --> 05:42.559
I'm just
taking some notes.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.909
Well, that's a lot
of writing for "I'm fine."

05:44.909 --> 05:47.999
Um, "She's fine"--
it's just two words,

05:47.999 --> 05:49.871
and one of them
is a contraction.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.395
You know, when those vents
get going,

05:52.395 --> 05:54.354
it is like a hurricane.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.920
So if there
is anyone to blame,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.444
it would be the wind.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.836
Okay,
I'll be going--

05:58.836 --> 06:01.099
And I just want you
to have the specifics.

06:01.099 --> 06:04.102
Because I know that you are on
a fact-finding mission.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.670
I'm just a counselor,
not an investigator.

06:06.670 --> 06:10.021
Yes, but it seems like you are
an investigator of feelings.

06:10.021 --> 06:13.938
And I want you to know
that I am feeling just fine.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.157
Facts.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.424
I mean, honestly, lately
I've been having some
issues with my sister.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.557
We argue about
my mom sometimes.

06:23.557 --> 06:24.732
She lives in Denver.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.473
Not my mom, my sister.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.953
Um, so anyway, I've been seeing
this guy Maurice a little bit--

06:28.953 --> 06:32.043
No, I meant, how are you doing
in relation to the fire?

06:32.043 --> 06:33.610
Right,
I was getting to that.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.786
So we went to this restaurant,
and guess what breaks out.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.745
A fire?
A mariachi band.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.964
And I said I wanted to leave.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.444
So I made him think
that I don't like mariachi.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.706
But the thing is, I do.

06:42.706 --> 06:43.751
It was just
a small restaurant,

06:43.751 --> 06:45.013
and it was really loud.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.493
Accident schmaccident.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.972
I smell arson.

06:47.972 --> 06:50.627
Ask any of my exes.
It's always arson.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.368
I blame
"Waiting to Exhale."

06:54.196 --> 06:55.589
Which one of you kids
want to honk the horn?

06:55.589 --> 06:57.895
Oh, c'mon, they've
heard horns before.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.462
This city
runs on road rage.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.421
I want to show them
the Jaws of Life.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.987
Okay, look, kids.

07:02.987 --> 07:06.600
This is what you use if you want
to destroy a car--

07:06.600 --> 07:08.645
if you want to get
someone out of a car.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.821
It's cold.
Can we go inside?

07:10.821 --> 07:12.823
Yeah, but the truck
only fits seven at a time.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.129
So who's got first?

07:14.129 --> 07:17.001
Man, I just
wanted to honk the horn.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.789
The pyramid and the cone
can be tricky,

07:21.789 --> 07:23.181
so make sure
you pay attention.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.357
Keep working on
those shapes, kids.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.838
Mr. Eddie needs
to have a conversation.

07:27.838 --> 07:28.926
Please hold.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.022
Interim Principal Gregory Eddie
at your service.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.763
We'll dig
into that later.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.025
First, an update.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.636
No concerns on
the students thus far.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.768
And all the staff has passed
my standard inspection.

07:44.768 --> 07:47.118
I've longed for protocol.
This is the best day of my life.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.251
Except for one person who isn't
handling it well...

07:49.251 --> 07:50.687
at all.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.297
Oh, well, look,
that's just how Janine is.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.516
I'm not
talking about Janine.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.518
Jacob?
That one lunch lady?

07:55.518 --> 07:56.867
- Her name is Shanae.
- That don't sound right.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.086
It's not her.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.740
Well, who could it be?
Mr. Johnson?

07:59.740 --> 08:01.785
That is the single
most well-adjusted man
I have ever met.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.396
I'm talking about
Barbara Howard.

08:04.396 --> 08:05.833
Are you sure
you don't mean Janine?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.878
I'm sure.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.271
Listen, I've been with
people in the aftermath

08:09.271 --> 08:10.881
of some tough situations--

08:10.881 --> 08:12.361
heart attacks, flooding,

08:12.361 --> 08:14.232
wig falling off
at an assembly.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.539
Nothing shakes people up
more than a fire.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.585
There's usually something
under the surface.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.065
I feel like you're
reading her wrong.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.632
Barbara
is the most together

08:22.632 --> 08:24.416
and collected person
at this school.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.548
She's made mistakes,
but she moved on--

08:25.548 --> 08:28.116
Oh! Miss Janet.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.900
There you are.

08:29.900 --> 08:33.251
I just wanted to reiterate
that I am fine.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.557
Is that all?

08:34.557 --> 08:36.385
Also, I wanted to add
that I never

08:36.385 --> 08:38.909
listen to Chaka Khan's
"Through the Fire"

08:38.909 --> 08:40.955
when it comes up
on my Pandora.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.523
"I'm Every Woman,"
not a pyromaniac.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.177
No one was thinking that, Barbara.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.570
I know, but I just
wanted to make sure

08:47.570 --> 08:48.832
that it was
on the record.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.355
You know,
in that little...

08:50.355 --> 08:52.270
fact-finding
notebook of hers.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.533
Facts.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.711
It's worrisome.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.539
But I still think you should
take a look at Janine.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.154
Is everything okay,
Barbara?

09:06.154 --> 09:08.591
Didn't I make that
perfectly clear earlier?

09:12.116 --> 09:13.596
Well, I just
wanted you to know

09:13.596 --> 09:14.728
that if you
feel any which way,

09:14.728 --> 09:16.599
you can come to me,
as a friend,

09:16.599 --> 09:19.471
or, if you prefer it
to be more formal,

09:19.471 --> 09:20.951
as your interim principal.

09:20.951 --> 09:23.258
You are not a principal, Gregory.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.216
You are but a child.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.044
I'm just making sure
that you're good.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.959
I'm as good as it gets.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.700
Perfect, even.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.702
I'm also just making my rounds
to remind all staff

09:32.702 --> 09:34.530
about the fire safety meeting
at lunch.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.140
Thank you,
but no thank you.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.229
It's mandatory.

09:38.229 --> 09:41.972
Gregory,
I am spiritually tenured.

09:41.972 --> 09:46.107
Mandates are nothing more
than fervent suggestions.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.152
Ava would
let me skip this.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.286
Respectfully and thankfully,
I'm not Ava.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.985
And don't you think
if anyone should attend

09:54.985 --> 09:57.771
the fire safety meeting,
it should be you?

09:57.771 --> 09:58.772
Considering...

09:58.772 --> 10:01.644
Look, it's no big deal.

10:01.644 --> 10:06.344
My shawl caught fire on
a stained-glass Jesus candle.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.781
Nobody got hurt.

10:07.781 --> 10:11.523
So why don't we all just
put this ordeal behind us

10:11.523 --> 10:13.264
and move forward?

10:13.264 --> 10:14.657
I agree.
Oh!

10:14.657 --> 10:16.528
Let's move forward. Forward.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.095
After the meeting.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.837
Which is mandatory.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.492
I miss Ava.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.762
Are you all bored or just
kind of quietly reflecting?

10:32.762 --> 10:36.636
Holy smokes, this must be
the 15-pound turbo flathead.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.202
2018 model, too.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.683
They got too flashy
after the 2019s.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.293
Don't touch my axe.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.905
Melissa, I think your kids
are a little, like, disengaged.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.820
Nah! I haven't even
introduced them

10:46.820 --> 10:48.648
to the wonderful world
of the tiller yet.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.564
I bet this baby's got
some baller wheel markers.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.481
Wow, she, uh-- she seems
really into fire trucks.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.962
Yeah, we
call them Truckies. Mm.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.008
Just once I'd like a woman
to like me for me,

11:01.008 --> 11:02.923
not the truck,
you know?

11:04.751 --> 11:07.231
Yeah, I mean,
not super relatable,

11:07.231 --> 11:09.407
but empathizing
- nonetheless.
- Mm.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.583
Hey, thank you for
everything that you do.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.237
As a fellow
employee of the city

11:13.237 --> 11:16.240
and aspiring
humble hero...

11:16.240 --> 11:17.415
I see you.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.462
Any chance you could see
to getting your co-worker

11:20.462 --> 11:21.550
away from our truck?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.427
Hey, um...
I'm worried about Barbara.

11:29.427 --> 11:30.515
Oh, no, why?
What's wrong?

11:30.515 --> 11:31.603
What happened?
Where is she?

11:31.603 --> 11:33.170
She says she's fine. Okay.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.824
But the counselor
seems to think

11:34.824 --> 11:36.739
that she's not processing
what happened earlier.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.698
And that there may be
something else going on.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.743
Well, that counselor doesn't
know what she's talking about.

11:40.743 --> 11:43.746
She said she thought that
<i>I</i> might benefit from therapy.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.403
Right. But she may be onto
something with Barbara.

11:48.403 --> 11:49.752
So let's keep
an eye out.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.841
Okay, but, you know,
Barbara's solid as a rock.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.190
She's my rock.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.409
And, you know,
if she says she's fine,

11:54.409 --> 11:56.846
- then she's fine.
- Okay.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.543
Captain Robinson: Alright,
folks. Let's get serious.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.373
<i>♪ Think safe, be safe,
all throughout the day ♪</i>

12:02.373 --> 12:06.116
Doesn't even make sense.
Why would a fire own sunglasses?

12:06.116 --> 12:07.639
Can anyone tell me

12:07.639 --> 12:09.903
the three leading causes
of fires in schools?

12:09.903 --> 12:12.470
The CIA. No.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.037
Too close
to the truth, huh?

12:15.517 --> 12:18.738
Cooking, intentional action,
and heating.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.348
Let's save the questions
for the end, please.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.958
Less of a question,
more of a comment.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.221
I could run this meeting
in my sleep.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.310
Well, that won't be necessary,
but thanks for the offer.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.834
Let's move into
fire prevention.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.967
Typical firefighter machismo,
silencing women.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.360
There's a woman
right there.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.665
Yeah, well, that's new.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.493
Back in the day,
female firefighter

12:35.493 --> 12:37.974
was just the punch line of the
dirtiest joke you ever heard.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.323
Trust me.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.672
They crushed my dreams
with that

12:40.672 --> 12:42.892
"Girls can't be firefighters"
crap.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.676
Yeah, I think
that's generational.

12:44.676 --> 12:47.592
You can't spell firefighter
without "her."

12:48.680 --> 12:51.771
I mean, you gotta take the "G"
and the "T" out, but...

12:53.860 --> 12:57.080
Now, today's blaze
was the result of heating.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.343
A candle
was the heat source.

12:59.343 --> 13:02.999
And the fuel was
a haphazardly placed shawl.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.088
Which could hap-happen
to anyone.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.524
It was simply
an accident.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.830
Right, and that's not
an indictment

13:07.830 --> 13:09.092
on the owner
of said candle

13:09.092 --> 13:10.311
- or the owner of said shawl.
- Mm-hmm.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.747
I mean, and it definitely
doesn't mean

13:11.747 --> 13:13.314
that they're getting older
and growing forgetful,

13:13.314 --> 13:14.706
- if that's how they feel.
- Gregory.

13:14.706 --> 13:15.882
- What the hell?!
- What?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.187
But if they did
feel that way,

13:17.187 --> 13:18.449
they can just talk
to somebody.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.364
But if they don't, that--Gregory, stop.

13:20.364 --> 13:23.193
Look, I think what Gregory
means to say is that,

13:23.193 --> 13:24.978
you know, fires can start
in all kinds of ways.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.588
Right.
Right? Yes.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.981
Actually,
firefighters wind up

13:27.981 --> 13:29.591
starting a lot
of fires themselves.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.158
Uh, but you know
- that already.
- Excuse me?

13:31.158 --> 13:32.289
You know, one of the most
famous fires

13:32.289 --> 13:33.813
was actually
started by a cow.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.466
But I don't see them
asking a cow

13:35.466 --> 13:36.859
to join
a fire safety meeting.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.382
Right, Barb?

13:38.382 --> 13:39.819
I would like to see that, though.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.821
"Mooooo-ve!
There's fire!"

13:41.821 --> 13:43.735
Alright, folks,
this meeting was actually

13:43.735 --> 13:45.520
not meant to be
so interactive, okay?

13:45.520 --> 13:48.392
Bottom line-- no more
open flames in school.

13:48.392 --> 13:51.047
Intentional or not,
they start fires.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.832
Especially
when used carelessly.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.487
Excuse me, but what exactly
do you mean by open flame?

13:56.487 --> 13:58.663
I mean, surely
candles are still okay.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.709
A candle's an open flame,
so, no, they're not.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.406
Well, that's ridiculous.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.582
I've been lighting candles
here for 20 years

14:04.582 --> 14:06.323
without a single problem.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.499
- Until today.
- And there
won't be another.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.110
Exactly, there won't be
another one

14:10.110 --> 14:12.677
because there will be no
more candles on this property.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.201
Does that apply
to birthday candles?

14:14.201 --> 14:16.986
Well, that is unfair.
This school is full of hazards.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.205
And birthdays.

14:18.205 --> 14:20.424
You have no idea
the nonsense

14:20.424 --> 14:22.992
that teachers get away
with here repeatedly.

14:22.992 --> 14:27.344
But the one time I light
a candle for peace of mind,

14:27.344 --> 14:29.694
without ever having
a prior problem,

14:29.694 --> 14:32.001
you want to take it
away from me.

14:32.001 --> 14:37.093
Well, that is unfair
and ridiculous!

14:37.093 --> 14:39.095
Good job,
Little Fires Everywhere.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.271
You really helped
calm things down.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.621
Did you see that?

14:43.621 --> 14:45.754
Yes.
Yeah,
we're right here.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.023
Hey, Barb.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.416
Hey, don't worry about
that meeting.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.244
That was a farce.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.594
Hey, want something
to cheer you up?

14:59.594 --> 15:02.031
Take a look at these pictures
of me with the fire truck, huh?

15:02.031 --> 15:04.033
Hard to be mad
when I look that good.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.470
Your hair matches the truck. Marvelous.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.648
You wanna talk about it?

15:10.648 --> 15:12.389
I'm fine.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.564
Okay.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.481
Been dealing with
Gerald's health.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.961
Barb...

15:18.961 --> 15:20.963
We had
a prostate situation.

15:20.963 --> 15:21.964
Oh, no.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.313
Oh, my gosh.
Is he okay?

15:23.313 --> 15:25.794
Yeah, doctor
called this morning

15:25.794 --> 15:27.622
said he is
in the clear.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.971
Oh, thank God.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.931
But those PSA numbers
came back high.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.149
And, y-you know,
the past few days

15:33.149 --> 15:36.109
just waiting to find out
the results,

15:36.109 --> 15:37.762
it's been stressful.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.286
Of course.
I'm so sorry.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.852
I'm sorry I didn't know.

15:40.852 --> 15:44.856
Well, all I could do was
light my candle and pray.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.336
Mm.
What was I gonna do?

15:46.336 --> 15:47.947
Sit around and worry
about it all day?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.339
That never does any good.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.601
Right? That's life.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.081
Just always something
coming at you.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.778
You just gotta
keep on truckin'.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.128
Keep truckin'.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.999
I mean,
if we were to blab

15:56.999 --> 15:59.132
every time
life got hard,

15:59.132 --> 16:00.220
we would be...

16:00.220 --> 16:02.526
Janine.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.008
Oh, I'm glad
he's okay, honey.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.662
Yeah.
Okay.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.360
Well, I better get back
to those firefighters.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.710
I gotta help them
find their keys.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.542
Ma'am, we really need
to get going.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.370
There has to be a fire somewhere.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.549
Hey, man.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.899
I was just playing a little
pick-up solo Ultimate.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.336
Ultimate Frisbee.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.468
Solo play helps you
burn the most calories.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.122
It's niche.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.906
Anyways, I got my commemorative
Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!

16:34.906 --> 16:36.734
frisbee stuck up on
that ledge over there.

16:36.734 --> 16:39.476
Why don't you just use these...
cookies?

16:39.476 --> 16:40.869
They look hefty.
Get the frisbee down.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.349
Uh, no.
Um, no!

16:42.349 --> 16:43.524
Oh, no, please!
Please!

16:43.524 --> 16:45.091
It's a 57-step recipe.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.223
You know, I actually wasn't even
gonna ask the squad

16:47.223 --> 16:48.616
to help get it down.

16:48.616 --> 16:49.791
I had another idea.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.489
Are you familiar
with the Schemmentis

16:52.489 --> 16:54.100
of Southern Philadelphia?

16:55.797 --> 16:58.800
Hey, B-to-the-A-to-the-R-
to-the B...

16:58.800 --> 17:00.280
to-the-A-to-the-R-
to-the A.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.412
Hey, how you doing?
Just coming to check on you.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.805
Holding space for you

17:03.805 --> 17:06.547
in case you wanted to,
you know, talk.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.027
There's no need to worry.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.247
I will not be
lighting my candle anymore

17:11.247 --> 17:13.206
per the orders
of the district

17:13.206 --> 17:15.077
and the interim principal.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.166
Oh, would we
say that I ordered?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.341
That sounds strong.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.690
Well, either way,

17:19.690 --> 17:22.258
I will not be lighting
my candle anymore.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.086
And that's life, right?

17:24.086 --> 17:25.392
Right.

17:31.572 --> 17:35.097
Mrs. Howard,
is the fire done?

17:35.097 --> 17:39.275
Oh, sweetheart,
the fire is all done.

17:39.275 --> 17:42.061
Would you like to talk
about it with Miss Janet,

17:42.061 --> 17:44.193
the nice lady
from earlier?

17:44.193 --> 17:45.586
It's okay.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.892
You know it's okay
to feel scared.

17:47.892 --> 17:50.112
You don't have to pretend
that you're not.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.636
Pretending can
make it harder.

17:54.029 --> 17:58.686
You know, sometimes
Mrs. Howard gets scared...

18:00.035 --> 18:01.645
...and upset, too.

18:05.258 --> 18:06.911
And that's okay.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.826
Okay?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.224
Frisbee secured!

18:15.224 --> 18:17.618
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

18:17.618 --> 18:20.447
Ooh, should she really
be up there in heels?

18:20.447 --> 18:21.839
She's wearing a helmet.

18:21.839 --> 18:23.537
Hey, why don't you try
playing a sport

18:23.537 --> 18:26.496
that actually involves balls...
like downhill skiing.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.287
Thanks for
letting me do that.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.593
That felt even better
than I could've imagined.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.029
Don't mention it.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.292
You should've told me
that you're a Schemmenti!

18:39.292 --> 18:40.554
- Yeah.
- Your uncle was a legend.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.295
He put out
the Hawthorne fire in '95.

18:42.295 --> 18:43.644
Mm-hmm.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.602
Never did find out
who started that.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.778
It was started
by my other uncle.

18:47.778 --> 18:50.129
And I'm not snitching.
He's proud of it.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.697
I get it.
It was just an accident.

18:53.697 --> 18:56.439
And you are Mary J. Blige
levels of "Just Fine."

18:56.439 --> 18:58.789
Actually, I want to thank you
for coming today,

18:58.789 --> 19:02.271
because I have been dealing
with some things at home

19:02.271 --> 19:06.232
and the fire was a direct result
of that stress.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.451
Almost to the letter.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.542
Thank you for sharing,
Mrs. Howard.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.718
You know, if you want,

19:14.718 --> 19:16.720
I can write you
a day off.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.200
A day off?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.723
For what?

19:19.723 --> 19:22.030
A day off because
you might need it...

19:22.030 --> 19:23.249
or just want it.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.468
I have only ever
taken a day off

19:25.468 --> 19:29.211
because I was sick
or a vacation.

19:29.211 --> 19:32.083
Once to get my hair done.
It was an emergency.

19:32.083 --> 19:35.086
Kirk Franklin was in town
with The Family.

19:36.566 --> 19:39.090
But I've never taken a day off
for no reason.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.831
Feels like
there is a reason.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.007
It's actually called
a mental health day.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.836
But if I said that,
she wouldn't take it.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.577
I know her type.

19:47.577 --> 19:50.754
Seems like your principal
leaves whenever she wants.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.844
Well...

19:53.844 --> 19:56.412
Here is
a work-excusal form.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.935
Don't you need
to put my name on it?

19:57.935 --> 19:59.023
Oh, it's on there.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.113
Had a feeling.

20:03.550 --> 20:06.205
Now, I know you said
you were fine, but...

20:06.205 --> 20:09.425
♪ You are my sunshine,
my only sun-- ♪

20:09.425 --> 20:10.600
♪ You're not Barbara

20:11.862 --> 20:13.168
Barb took the day off.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.257
What?
Uh, is she okay?

20:15.257 --> 20:17.694
I mean, is everything alright?
Is she mad at me?

20:17.694 --> 20:18.782
Just because you
got a round face

20:18.782 --> 20:20.262
like the Teletubbies
sun baby

20:20.262 --> 20:22.090
doesn't mean that the world
revolves around you.

20:23.004 --> 20:23.961
Where's Barbara?

20:23.961 --> 20:25.441
Take that blazer off.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.964
You think you the principal
or something?

20:26.964 --> 20:28.270
The hell happening
'round here?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.316
Hey, Ava,
what did Barbara say?

20:30.316 --> 20:31.708
She said she needed
some time to herself.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.319
I tried to send her
to that spa

20:33.319 --> 20:35.103
I was at yesterday--
they offer referral cash--

20:35.103 --> 20:37.236
but she said she wanted to
"spend time with her husband."

20:37.236 --> 20:38.498
Good for her, though.

20:38.498 --> 20:41.196
Wow, never thought
I'd see the day.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.373
Wait a minute.
You were at a spa?

20:47.550 --> 20:49.944
Good night.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.380
Still with the cookies?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.382
Come on,
it's been days.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.992
They're probably
even worse than before.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.603
Actually, they age
like fine wine

20:56.603 --> 20:58.822
due to a key ingredient--
grape-seed oil.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.476
Yeah, that's not
how that works.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.304
Oh, I think
I understand fermentation.

21:02.304 --> 21:03.697
You know, they're putting
these new things

21:03.697 --> 21:04.872
in cookies these days.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.308
It's called chocolate chips.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.005
Hardy har.
See you tomorrow.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.715
Son of a Bocelli,
they're delicious.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.326
Wipe the tape.
