WEBVTT

00:37.162 --> 00:38.871
How did you get beyond the gates?

00:39.039 --> 00:42.166
They are a weak thing
against such strong purpose.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.752
You risk discovery.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.839
I would risk everything for you.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.718
We cannot do this.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.845
No.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.100
We cannot.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.112
You fucking whore.

02:02.498 --> 02:04.957
Apologies.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.460
Domina summons you.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.809
Apologies.
I did not hear you calling.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.064
Gather Gaia's belongings.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.900
Titus would have them removed.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.952
I know how close you held her.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.121
It was an unfortunate accident.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.542
She was taken from us too soon.

03:29.710 --> 03:34.213
Yet blessed to count you as friend
while she was among us.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.841
She was more than friend.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.176
She was family.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.725
Titus has ordered
Gaia's slave removed

03:45.893 --> 03:48.686
and commanded that salt and spelt
be scattered...

03:48.854 --> 03:50.855
decision and ritual,

03:51.023 --> 03:54.400
to cleanse all trace of Gaia
from beneath his roof.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.571
I asked Quintus
to speak to his father,

03:58.739 --> 04:02.325
to not let Gaia be swept
so easily from memory.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.745
But a wife's desires do not always
mirror those of her husband.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.415
Then she must keep them hidden.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.711
We will tell them ritual was performed
even in absence of the deed,

04:13.879 --> 04:16.839
Naevia and Diona to attest
if questioned.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.051
Gratitude.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.438
I am assaulted on all fronts.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.649
Tullius spills blood
in our own house,

04:34.816 --> 04:37.193
yet my father condemns
innocent son.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.403
The blame is mine.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.031
If only I had stayed a while longer.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.367
You might have joined Gaia
in untimely end.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.953
No, the fault rests
with Tullius alone.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.291
Listen to them cheering
the final games of the old arena.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.001
Yet here we stand,

04:54.169 --> 04:56.796
as removed from them
as Gaia from this world,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.757
courtesy again
of fucking Tullius.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.885
It appears I will be making
appearance after all.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.055
You gain invitation to the games?

05:06.223 --> 05:08.849
At request of the magistrate...

05:09.017 --> 05:11.769
a minor position,
the effort far exceeding the reward.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.817
It stirs heart to know you are unscathed
from association with me.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.194
Petronius seemed quite pleased
with your offerings.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.406
Perhaps there is still opportunity
for you to gain placement

05:23.573 --> 05:25.241
in the opening games
of the new arena.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.785
Fuck the new arena.
Fuck Tullius. Fuck the fucking gods.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.580
None of it matters now.
My father gives ultimatum.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.428
Lucretia must no longer hold
title of wife.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.335
- Titus dissolves your marriage?
- That would be a kindness.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.838
He demands that I dissolve it
or find myself put to street with her.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.550
Perhaps it best
if she were to find another husband.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.972
I would sever cock from fucking body
than see her from my arms.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.392
I would hold the same at first
in your position.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.853
Yet it would crumble
to simple reason:

05:54.021 --> 05:55.855
If you still intend to run the Ludus,

05:56.023 --> 05:58.566
what other choice remains?

06:32.976 --> 06:35.644
Your friend...
he seems of a mood.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.440
As would you, if trusted brother

06:39.608 --> 06:41.942
presented your ass to a Roman
for rough pleasure.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.028
You speak of piss.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.740
And your fortunes shrivel,
absent Dagan.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.201
Much like his cock.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.933
Friend.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.856
What do you make of Dagan?

07:21.024 --> 07:24.026
Size and skill an advantage.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.571
If dull wit can be honed,
he will prove asset.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.077
Gannicus.

07:33.245 --> 07:35.913
Work the palus if you are able.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.626
Schemes plotted while back is turned,
and there stand the results.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.294
Apologies, Dominus.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.755
You but did as commanded.

07:44.923 --> 07:47.550
The burden lies with errant son,

07:47.717 --> 07:49.593
cast adrift

07:49.761 --> 07:53.389
upon churning sea of impropriety.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.559
I would navigate this house

07:56.726 --> 07:59.061
towards calmer waters,
your hands to aid me.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.230
Speak and see them set to task.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.319
A good count of these men
were acquired in my absence.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.240
Arrange competition,
so that I may determine

08:11.408 --> 08:13.367
true worth of all beneath my roof.

08:13.535 --> 08:17.329
Our champion should be absent
such contest until recovery.

08:17.497 --> 08:21.667
I hold no man champion
until proven so to my eyes.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.753
Those who stand victorious
at ranking's end

08:24.921 --> 08:27.339
will find honored position
within these walls.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.176
Those who do not
will be sold to the mines.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.635
Harsh reward for men
already bearing your mark.

08:32.804 --> 08:36.807
I remain unconvinced
all here are deserving of it.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.018
You are clear to your purpose?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.437
Yes, Dominus.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.574
Gladiators!

08:53.742 --> 08:55.284
Attend.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.210
Diona.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.213
- Where is Lucretia?
- I will fetch her, Dominus.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.798
No, leave her where she is.
You may answer question.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.718
Has salt and spelt been scattered?

09:12.886 --> 09:16.555
Yes, Dominus.
We swept it from the villa.

09:16.723 --> 09:20.017
A step towards proper path.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.231
Should have let the bitch
tell her own lies.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.191
Diona, lower voice.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.694
So now you command me?
Will you decide who fucks me as well?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.321
I did not mean...

09:32.489 --> 09:34.657
Do not think you stand above me.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.244
Cossutius could easily have chosen you,
had your cunt not been so loose.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.871
Why would you say such things?

09:41.039 --> 09:43.832
We have been as one
since we were children.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.877
I count you dearest friend.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.547
Friendship is a privilege,

09:50.715 --> 09:53.092
one not deserving of a whore.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.372
Come on, Rhaskos!

11:49.542 --> 11:53.837
Gnaeus, Pollux, take position.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.132
- What is this?
- Oh yeah, fucking shit?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.967
Contest to rank the men.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.053
I'm gonna cut
your goddamn head off.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.056
My decision yet to be given voice, and
you proceed as if I am already absent.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.016
This house must be
turned to order

12:06.184 --> 12:08.185
regardless of whether you happen
upon your senses.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.562
Lucretia is my wife.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.731
A word that should lift a man,

12:12.899 --> 12:16.527
filling his life with ease and children.
She gives you neither.

12:16.694 --> 12:20.406
You seek to tear heart from chest
and expect gratitude it no longer beats.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.827
I seek only to call you son
absent shame in the title.

12:27.580 --> 12:32.584
And I only ever wished
to make you proud, Father.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.381
The rankings will be decided
at contest's end two days hence.

12:37.549 --> 12:40.175
I will grant you equal time

12:40.343 --> 12:44.388
to prove that you have moved
beyond past transgressions.

12:44.556 --> 12:47.015
Dissolve your marriage

12:47.183 --> 12:49.601
or call me father no more.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.857
I bow and scrape,

12:55.024 --> 12:57.192
eating his shit and thanking him
for the pleasure,

12:57.360 --> 12:59.319
and this is reward...

12:59.487 --> 13:01.780
to be turned from my home,
my husband?

13:01.948 --> 13:04.116
You must make greater show.

13:04.284 --> 13:08.120
Ply him with dutiful words.
See his cup always filled with wine.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.206
To what end?
He's already made his decision.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.916
No.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.586
He places it in my hands,

13:15.753 --> 13:19.298
to prove that I am worthy
of being called his fucking son.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.800
And what response have you given?

13:23.094 --> 13:25.596
I have managed to delay
the presenting of it

13:25.763 --> 13:28.223
until the men have been
ranked in contest.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.476
I would have thought
your answer immediate.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.104
Well, we need time to convince him
of your worth.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.273
Is he the one that needs
convincing, Quintus?

13:36.441 --> 13:39.151
I will not have that fucking tone.
I defend you at every turn.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.695
And I have made every sacrifice.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.573
I have borne every duty asked.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.492
And yet here I stand on the brink.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.827
What more can I do?
I've given you everything.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.829
Except a child.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.835
I speak without thinking.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.423
No, you speak your heart.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.886
Lucretia.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.600
Fuck.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.293
The gods call you from our bed?

14:39.754 --> 14:42.005
I seek their guidance.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.049
Return to sleep.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.718
I would only dream of you.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.765
My own are filled
with troubling image...

14:51.933 --> 14:53.809
the walls alive with secrets,

14:53.977 --> 14:56.478
condemning those privy to them.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.155
We have borne witness

15:07.323 --> 15:10.701
to unfortunate events
removed from our hands.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.662
Yet this is an honorable house,

15:13.830 --> 15:16.081
one of deep history.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.125
The gods must surely remember this.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.003
You truly love this place.

15:22.463 --> 15:25.591
My life held no meaning
before I was brought here.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.761
This house is the foundation
upon which I was built.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.434
I feel nothing
but the weight of its beams.

15:40.106 --> 15:45.152
The burdens placed upon
us often overwhelm.

15:45.320 --> 15:49.281
But it remains our duty to bear them.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.995
Come.

15:55.163 --> 16:01.209
Let us pray and together
see weight lifted.

16:20.521 --> 16:21.688
Fuck him up!

16:23.358 --> 16:24.524
Yeah!

16:31.115 --> 16:33.450
Perhaps I should throw
the fucking tadpole back.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.999
Gnaeus continues to gain
in skill as retiarius.

16:41.167 --> 16:45.045
Soon he will ignite the crowd
as I promised.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.339
Apologies for the hour of my rising.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.383
Sleep came with difficulty last night.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.427
Your absence was not noticed.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.681
Yet the apology stands.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.517
A noble gesture well-appreciated.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.812
The mulsum more so.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.855
Let me fill your cup.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.566
Gnaeus... victor!

17:08.528 --> 17:13.240
Duratius, Crixus, take position.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.214
Begin.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.556
Crixus appears of a form,
does he not?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.230
He has proven a wise addition,

17:45.398 --> 17:48.567
one Gaia favored from first sight.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.778
Apologies. Tullius arrives.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.572
Tullius?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.741
- See him to my office.
- Dominus.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.577
What is that man doing
in our house?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.412
My house.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.748
And he comes in response
to invitation.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.335
Tullius should be hurled
from the fucking cliffs.

18:07.503 --> 18:10.172
Instead my father takes knee
to swallow cock.

18:10.339 --> 18:14.092
And you do nothing to stop him,
save lay blame where none should rest.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.888
I am a fool in such regard, allowing
frustration to strip sense from tongue.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.723
And spilling truth as consequence.

18:19.891 --> 18:22.267
I would not hurt you.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.937
Everything spins
from fucking control.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.153
You desire a son of your own

18:33.321 --> 18:37.115
to carry your name
and make you proud.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.701
I would do anything
to give you such a treasure.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.123
I must give him
my answer tomorrow.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.877
It is too late for such dreams.

19:04.894 --> 19:08.980
It is never too late
when will is set to purpose.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.107
What would you have me do?

19:12.693 --> 19:15.487
Whatever we must

19:15.655 --> 19:17.906
to rid ourselves of this problem.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.582
I recalled your fondness for mulsum.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.669
Varus assures the vintage
to be his finest.

19:30.837 --> 19:35.340
I am plied with honeyed wine
at every turn this day.

19:38.219 --> 19:41.513
A simple gesture
to smooth edge from jagged events.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.724
Jagged?

19:44.892 --> 19:47.686
A woman is dead, Tullius...

19:47.854 --> 19:51.189
a Roman woman, in my house.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.358
You go too far.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.528
I have come to make amends
with a gift.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.866
You offer wine
to wash away blood?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.535
I offer position

20:03.703 --> 20:06.538
in the opening games
of the new arena.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.623
Why would you do this?

20:10.167 --> 20:11.960
In honor of history.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.171
Capua has marveled
over many champions

20:15.339 --> 20:17.059
from the House of Batiatus
over the years...

20:17.216 --> 20:22.095
Hadrianus, Magnetius, Acerbitas

20:22.263 --> 20:26.391
and countless others
forged by steady and sensible hand.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.936
You flatter.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.898
On many occasion, but not this one.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.900
The storied victories
of your men

20:35.067 --> 20:37.319
were a part of the old arena

20:37.486 --> 20:40.739
as much as its wood and its sand.

20:40.907 --> 20:45.410
Yet its final day passed
absent the House of Batiatus...

20:45.578 --> 20:49.039
an unforgivable tragedy
caused by the actions of a foolish son.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.541
He knows my mind
towards this regard.

20:51.709 --> 20:56.338
Yet his actions do not stand alone
in deserving condemnation.

20:56.505 --> 21:00.216
The past cannot be changed.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.261
Let us turn eye towards horizon
of glories untold,

21:03.429 --> 21:05.305
ones to be shared in together.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.390
And what is it you seek

21:07.558 --> 21:10.435
in return for such generosity?

21:10.603 --> 21:13.271
The only thing I have ever sought...

21:16.859 --> 21:18.109
Gannicus.

21:21.030 --> 21:25.408
My son believes the man a champion
above all others.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.456
You are a reasonable man, Titus.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.583
You always have been.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.128
All I ask is that you consider
what is best for your house.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.009
Enjoy the wine.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.653
Domina calls for food and wine.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.658
Diona.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.078
Pause a moment if you need.
I will say I could not find you.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.914
Naevia.

22:13.082 --> 22:18.712
My words... I did not mean them.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.007
I know.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.635
Your friendship, your love...

22:25.803 --> 22:29.305
it is constant reminder
of what I have lost.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.189
I pray to the gods every night

22:38.357 --> 22:41.901
that the next man I am
forced to lie with takes my life.

23:19.273 --> 23:21.066
Hmm.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.457
Gannicus!

24:19.625 --> 24:21.793
You are the victor.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.677
I nearly had you.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.638
Nearly.

24:41.188 --> 24:44.983
Ashur, Dagan, take position.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.670
Begin.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.184
Good Tullius has taken his leave?

25:19.351 --> 25:20.727
He has.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.479
And what has he carried
from our house this time?

26:06.732 --> 26:11.569
Ashur... fucking victor.

26:16.408 --> 26:20.411
Rest and tend wounds.

26:20.579 --> 26:24.666
Tomorrow brings end of contest
and appropriate reckoning.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.263
I would have words.

26:40.182 --> 26:42.267
As would l.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.895
Accompany me to town
and let us break them.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.284
Melitta.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.370
Once they have departed,

27:02.538 --> 27:04.622
there's something I would ask of you.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.758
I have felt your eyes lingering.

27:15.926 --> 27:19.554
Yet they always turn away
when I meet them.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.723
As should yours.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.308
Then I must tear them out

27:23.475 --> 27:25.935
if they are to obey such a command.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.146
You must stop this.

27:28.314 --> 27:32.191
I have vowed to
a thousand times a day,

27:32.359 --> 27:34.360
to return to drink and whores,

27:34.528 --> 27:37.655
forcing you from my mind.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.994
Then I catch a glimpse of you

27:43.162 --> 27:45.830
and my world ends.

27:47.416 --> 27:51.461
I have never felt greater love

27:51.628 --> 27:55.173
than when I hold my husband
in my arms.

28:15.736 --> 28:20.198
Gannicus, what seizes you?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.909
You drop guard,
allowing Barca advantage.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.203
The man almost had you.

28:25.371 --> 28:29.832
I was lost in a moment,
caught by a dream.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.045
Then wake from it.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.200
Leave us.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.922
You are a Gaul, are you not?

29:18.090 --> 29:20.425
Yes, Domina.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.429
Many believe the seed of a Gaul
to rival that of Jupiter himself.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.433
Tell me,

29:28.600 --> 29:31.769
how many sons sprang
from your father's cock?

29:31.937 --> 29:34.355
Five, Domina.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.651
And from his father before him?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.612
The same.

29:44.450 --> 29:48.786
Your subligaria... remove it.

30:02.384 --> 30:05.303
You are never to speak of this.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.431
Do you understand, slave?

30:08.599 --> 30:11.142
Yes, Domina.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.689
Well, I would not look at you.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.983
The sight turns stomach.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.074
Enter me.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.955
And do not cease
until you have spilled seed.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.562
My very first memories

30:56.730 --> 30:59.649
were formed within this arena,

30:59.816 --> 31:01.692
attending the games as a child

31:01.860 --> 31:03.986
upon my father's knee,

31:04.154 --> 31:07.365
too young to yet form words.

31:07.533 --> 31:11.994
Yet even then I knew

31:12.162 --> 31:15.665
that I would give my life to this place.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.208
A noble calling.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.377
Mm.

31:19.545 --> 31:23.214
One I had dreamed you would share in.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.759
Was I not raised here as well,
upon your knee?

31:26.927 --> 31:28.469
You were.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.555
I fear it is the one thing
we hold common now.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.808
And you stand me at fault,
as you always have.

31:33.976 --> 31:36.227
I stand you accountable
for your actions.

31:41.567 --> 31:46.362
You have caused much heartache,

31:46.530 --> 31:49.156
never heeding my words,

31:49.324 --> 31:54.245
fighting me at every
turn, your ambition

31:54.413 --> 31:58.374
the bolt hurled against my wishes.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.460
And here is where it has led...

32:01.628 --> 32:04.547
two men at constant odds,

32:04.715 --> 32:08.426
mired in the ruins
of what might have been,

32:08.594 --> 32:11.596
ruins I aided in creation.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.432
I wanted you to join me here
to see them buried.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.728
You are my son, Quintus,

32:18.895 --> 32:21.314
and I will always love you,

32:21.481 --> 32:25.776
no matter the path you take.

32:25.944 --> 32:30.615
What moves such downpour
after eternal drought?

32:34.119 --> 32:36.120
Tullius makes offer...

32:36.288 --> 32:38.456
position in the opening games.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.125
- At what price?
- Gannicus.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.048
And your response?

32:47.215 --> 32:49.133
Without meaning

32:49.301 --> 32:51.844
if you are not by my side
upon the day's arrival.

32:52.012 --> 32:55.431
You give me until tomorrow
and yet now press for answer?

32:55.599 --> 32:59.310
A day, a year... a man either
knows his heart or he does not.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.812
Stand with me

33:01.980 --> 33:04.857
and we shall rise together, huh?

33:05.025 --> 33:07.151
I will not turn from my wife.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.284
You really did not want this life,
did you?

33:18.497 --> 33:21.666
Well, whatever one
you find in this world,

33:21.833 --> 33:24.043
I pray it brings you peace.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.546
Father.

33:43.980 --> 33:50.611
A memento of days past.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.768
I could not do it.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.938
Sit beside me.

34:27.107 --> 34:31.193
I had the instrument in hand.
His back was turned.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.320
A simple motion

34:33.487 --> 34:37.742
and our troubles forever removed.

34:42.789 --> 34:47.083
But when the moment came,

34:47.252 --> 34:51.045
he spoke to me with affection,
giving voice to sentiment.

34:51.214 --> 34:55.134
I was wrong to push you
to such thoughts against him.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.557
Some actions carry
too steep a price.

35:01.725 --> 35:04.727
Even in refraining,
the ground beneath us pitches.

35:04.895 --> 35:09.607
Tomorrow we must prepare
to leave this house.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.360
You've given your answer?

35:13.528 --> 35:16.781
The only one
my tongue could ever speak.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.909
You honor me.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.078
I attempt to gain the sun,

35:23.246 --> 35:26.457
only to plunge into the depths,

35:26.625 --> 35:30.085
while Tullius rides with Apollo,

35:30.253 --> 35:32.546
bribing his way
with an amphora of mulsum

35:32.714 --> 35:34.590
and promises to the air.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.134
It does not matter.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.934
We must leave this house

35:45.101 --> 35:47.436
with nothing but our clothes,

35:47.604 --> 35:49.230
a few possessions,

35:49.397 --> 35:52.650
not even a slave to attend us.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.987
We have lost everything.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.867
Not everything.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.552
The men have fought
with passion and honor...

36:19.719 --> 36:22.638
a testament to your work
as doctore.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.850
I but carry torch lit by more
deserving predecessor.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.185
He would have been proud.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.521
This house has seen many
champions, Oenomaus,

36:30.689 --> 36:32.648
yet you stand tallest among them.

36:32.816 --> 36:34.525
I have not the words, Dominus.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.368
Those who do,

36:44.536 --> 36:48.122
tend to weave them
to undeserved advantage, hmm?

36:48.290 --> 36:50.583
Where do we stand
upon the rankings?

36:50.750 --> 36:53.085
Eight men have yet to hold victory.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.754
And one suffers grievous injury.

36:58.842 --> 37:02.052
It pains to lose Dagan.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.513
The Syrian had shown
much promise.

37:04.681 --> 37:06.557
More so than Ashur.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.475
Yet Dagan is now blind

37:08.643 --> 37:11.729
to attack from the right...
a disadvantage in the arena.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.774
Well, let us shift from the unfortunate
to the blessed.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.234
Who holds the pinnacle?

37:17.402 --> 37:20.738
Two men own equal victory...
Crixus and Gannicus.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.657
They are to face each other
in the final contest.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.701
Oh, Gannicus is removed
from contention.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.996
I have sent word to Tullius
agreeing to terms of sale.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.416
Sale to Tullius?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.460
Well, he makes offer.

37:34.628 --> 37:37.755
I had thoughts towards refusal,
but they have dimmed.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.882
I would speak
towards reigniting them.

37:40.050 --> 37:42.676
Strong words, Oenomaus.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.095
Quintus has plied me with many
upon the subject.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.932
He inflates Gannicus's worth
at great cost to this house.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.559
Apologies, but in this
your son and I are in agreement.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.771
None stand more worthy
to hold the title of champion.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.191
You allow personal relation
to cloud judgment.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.902
True, Gannicus is trusted friend.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.821
Yet I speak from position
of doctore,

38:02.989 --> 38:05.449
one but a moment ago
you sought to praise.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.409
If I pull acceptance to Tullius,

38:07.577 --> 38:09.578
we will be excluded
from future games.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.872
We would be forced
to beg for matches

38:12.040 --> 38:15.125
in the lesser venues
of Nola or Neapolis.

38:15.293 --> 38:19.380
A heavy price, as is often that
of the honorable choice.

38:19.547 --> 38:23.050
Let the gods
show us the way then.

38:23.218 --> 38:26.470
If Gannicus proves himself
against Crixus, he shall remain.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.390
Yet if he falls,
he shall leave this house

38:29.557 --> 38:32.184
following the others
that have failed to honor it.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.479
Dominus.

38:44.114 --> 38:46.323
I am to be sold to fucking Tullius?

38:46.491 --> 38:48.283
Only if you fall.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.244
Clear mind.

38:50.412 --> 38:52.913
Prove yourself
the man I know you to be.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.083
Doctore, let us begin

38:56.251 --> 38:59.545
and know who truly stands
champion of this house.

39:04.718 --> 39:09.847
Crixus, Gannicus, take position.

39:11.099 --> 39:13.809
A second chance
to prove myself against you.

39:13.977 --> 39:16.270
The gods have heard my prayers.

39:16.438 --> 39:18.480
And they curse you
in the answering.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.488
Begin.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.545
Get him! Yeah!

39:45.216 --> 39:50.054
Father, we're near
ready to leave.

39:52.265 --> 39:55.392
Pause a moment
and see contest ended.

39:58.188 --> 40:00.272
Finish preparations.

40:02.442 --> 40:04.568
Crixus again shows form.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.907
As does Gannicus.

40:10.075 --> 40:13.285
Both men you have often praised.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.206
Perhaps you have
learned something

40:17.373 --> 40:19.708
after all these years.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.376
Perhaps.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.103
You have lost sense.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.148
All attention is upon the match.

40:43.316 --> 40:45.275
No one will notice your absence
for many hours.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.237
- They will brand me fugitivus.
- They will not find you.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.326
Buy passage far from Capua

40:54.494 --> 40:56.370
and the things
that have been done to you.

40:56.538 --> 40:59.289
- Where did you get this?
- Spirited from Gaia's things.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.375
They will not be missed.

41:01.543 --> 41:04.336
You fade with each day.

41:04.504 --> 41:07.297
Do not make me bear witness
to your passing.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.674
Come with me.

41:08.842 --> 41:11.969
I attend Domina.
My absence would be noticed.

41:13.847 --> 41:15.973
Go before contest is ended.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.768
I will see you again one day.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.979
I swear to you.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.026
Go.

41:44.127 --> 41:45.294
A match for the ages.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.840
I shall miss this.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.260
Water.

42:42.769 --> 42:43.936
Yes!

43:52.380 --> 43:54.798
Crixus... victor.

44:00.263 --> 44:02.139
Why did you drop your guard?

44:02.307 --> 44:05.392
You are champion now.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.603
That is all that matters.

44:13.151 --> 44:15.319
I would not thought it possible.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.447
To be said
of many things this day.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.868
Quintus, it's not too late.

44:28.499 --> 44:30.876
Father.

44:31.044 --> 44:32.336
Fetch the medicus.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.969
Your father burns high fever...

44:41.137 --> 44:43.263
a worrisome condition
for a man of his years.

44:43.431 --> 44:45.599
Well, is there nothing to be done?

44:45.767 --> 44:47.434
I have not the herbs.

44:47.602 --> 44:50.520
And the hour is late for us
to procure them.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.148
Go. I'll watch over him.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.796
I'll pound on every door in Capua
until we have what is needed.

44:55.860 --> 44:59.488
- And I would aid in the effort.
- And be welcome for it. Come.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.656
Keep him still until we return.

45:01.824 --> 45:04.076
A little wine, if seized by fit.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.216
Drink.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.387
Move Tullius's wine from sight.

45:30.395 --> 45:33.021
Apologies, Domina.

45:35.983 --> 45:39.069
I would have permission
to see Gannicus.

45:39.237 --> 45:40.612
You ask this now?

45:40.780 --> 45:43.532
I know he is to be sold tomorrow.

45:43.699 --> 45:47.619
I would have final words
before he departs.

46:17.942 --> 46:22.279
I would share drink
with an old friend.

46:24.740 --> 46:29.077
Is that all that
I am... a friend?

46:29.245 --> 46:31.288
Gannicus.

46:32.957 --> 46:35.333
I do not care for honey in my wine.

46:35.501 --> 46:37.961
It serves only to mask bitter taste.

46:38.129 --> 46:41.173
A blessing in such moments.

46:48.556 --> 46:51.975
You are to be sold to Tullius.

46:53.102 --> 46:55.395
Oenomaus warned of it,

46:55.563 --> 46:57.105
should I fall to Crixus.

46:57.273 --> 46:59.649
You let Crixus win.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.610
Why would you do such a thing?

47:01.777 --> 47:05.489
Because I cannot stay
within these walls,

47:05.656 --> 47:07.991
to gaze upon you every day

47:08.159 --> 47:10.243
and be denied your touch.

47:10.411 --> 47:13.079
I have never turned from challenge,

47:13.247 --> 47:16.917
yet I am without strength
to face this one.

47:17.084 --> 47:19.252
Then it is for the best.

47:24.342 --> 47:31.014
Because despite my
words, I stand as weak.

47:44.654 --> 47:46.863
I want no wine.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.949
Medicus gave order.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.326
Drink.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.038
Mm.

47:57.250 --> 47:59.000
It should help you rest.

47:59.168 --> 48:04.673
My son gives up
everything for you.

48:05.675 --> 48:08.718
As I for him.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.095
You truly love him?

48:10.263 --> 48:12.514
With all my heart.

48:12.682 --> 48:15.016
He is never happier

48:15.184 --> 48:18.353
than when he is by your side.

48:18.521 --> 48:22.065
Tell me I have been mistaken
about you.

48:22.233 --> 48:25.610
Tell me you are not the serpent
I have thought you to be.

48:27.863 --> 48:30.574
I am not.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.868
I'm far worse.

48:37.248 --> 48:41.459
I never cared
what you thought of me,

48:41.627 --> 48:43.962
my lack of breeding,
my absence of family

48:44.130 --> 48:47.424
or a name of worth.
These things I cannot deny.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.843
But how low you considered
your son...

48:50.011 --> 48:53.179
a man I love more than life itself...

48:53.347 --> 48:56.558
that could not be tolerated.

48:58.769 --> 49:01.313
So I began poisoning
your beloved honey wine.

49:03.899 --> 49:08.612
My intent not to rob you of life,

49:08.779 --> 49:11.281
only to mimic illness.

49:13.492 --> 49:17.954
A cough,
increasing in its discomfort,

49:18.122 --> 49:20.707
easily blamed
on Capua's dust and heat.

49:22.251 --> 49:24.252
It brought much joy
when you departed

49:24.420 --> 49:26.421
for the wet shores of Sicilia.

49:26.589 --> 49:29.591
And Quintus... how he flourished

49:29.759 --> 49:32.719
when removed
from overbearing shadow.

49:34.347 --> 49:35.972
And then you returned

49:36.140 --> 49:39.309
to torture him,
as you did all those years.

49:40.353 --> 49:44.397
So I began bringing you
your honeyed wine again,

49:44.565 --> 49:47.150
to force you back to Sicilia.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.486
Yet it was not enough.

49:49.654 --> 49:53.865
You were not moved
despite ailing health.

49:54.033 --> 49:56.326
No.

49:58.996 --> 50:02.832
A more permanent solution
was required between us,

50:03.000 --> 50:05.502
one that I added to Tullius's gift.

50:37.702 --> 50:41.705
Quintus will not forgive Tullius this.

50:41.872 --> 50:44.374
He will strike in your name.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.668
And Gaia's death will be avenged.

50:49.380 --> 50:52.382
Breathe. Breathe.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.056
Breathe!

51:11.694 --> 51:13.903
You curse this house.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.573
No, Father.

51:16.741 --> 51:19.367
I elevate it.

51:28.919 --> 51:32.005
Breathe. Melitta.

51:46.228 --> 51:48.480
Melitta, breathe.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.899
Melitta, breathe!

51:51.066 --> 51:53.318
No!

52:29.313 --> 52:31.397
Domina.

52:37.655 --> 52:39.155
Melitta.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.658
The wine.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.159
It was the wine.

52:48.165 --> 52:50.124
Take her.

52:53.629 --> 52:56.673
Oenomaus must not know
she came to your cell.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.883
She was never with you.

53:04.849 --> 53:07.100
Return to the Ludus.

53:09.228 --> 53:10.687
Go!
