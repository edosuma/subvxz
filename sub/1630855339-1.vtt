00:32.875 --> 00:33.958
Tyler!

01:51.708 --> 01:53.666
He's breathing, he's breathing.

02:22.791 --> 02:24.791
Multiple gunshot wounds.

02:24.791 --> 02:26.250
Airway's secured.

02:51.583 --> 02:53.541
We've done everything we can.

02:54.833 --> 02:57.333
It would be wise to consider a threshold.

03:06.833 --> 03:09.333
Sis... it's not fair
to leave him like this.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.166
I'm not giving up on him.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.750
What was that?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.791
- Fuck off.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.333
And we're going to hold for five.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.666
- Four, three, two...

04:36.125 --> 04:37.250
Keep it slow.

04:58.583 --> 04:59.875
Just go home, would ya?

05:03.833 --> 05:07.125
Or what? You'll run over my foot?

05:09.375 --> 05:10.833
That's about all I could do.

05:12.416 --> 05:14.875
Thanks, Nik. For keeping me around.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.875
Really excited about
this next chapter of my life.

05:21.583 --> 05:22.750
Believe it or not,

05:22.750 --> 05:25.833
it's pretty difficult
to let someone you care about die.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.750
But you fought your way back.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.291
You just have to find out why.

06:12.541 --> 06:13.416
Zurab.

06:20.458 --> 06:22.791
I just heard from the prison.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.958
They're extending your brother's
prison sentence by ten years.

07:15.625 --> 07:16.958
Governor.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.833
Zurab. Always wonderful to see you.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.583
How are you, my friend?

07:23.583 --> 07:25.291
I've been better.

07:25.291 --> 07:27.250
One of our prize bulls is sick.

07:27.250 --> 07:31.125
We have to kill him.
Bury him before he infects the others.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.166
You asked me here to commiserate?

07:35.250 --> 07:37.000
Walk with me, would you?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.875
You said it was urgent.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.875
I just heard that this morning
you signed off on

07:49.875 --> 07:52.916
extending my brother's prison sentence
by ten years.

07:52.916 --> 07:57.583
Your brother threw a DEA agent off a roof.

07:58.875 --> 08:01.125
The Americans are all over us.

08:02.541 --> 08:04.833
When Davit and I were young,

08:06.208 --> 08:09.333
I was to protect my brother at all costs.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.083
My father would never let me forget it.

08:13.375 --> 08:17.333
I contested his extradition to the States.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.583
Kept him in a Georgian prison.

08:20.291 --> 08:24.708
I even allowed his family
to be housed in prison with him.

08:26.041 --> 08:29.250
Let's not forget who put you
in this office. And why.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.333
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

08:35.583 --> 08:40.041
One of our prize bulls is sick.

08:41.833 --> 08:42.708
I told you.

09:15.791 --> 09:18.916
My man! Looking good. Look at this.

09:18.916 --> 09:20.958
What's with the shirt?
You lose a bet or something?

09:20.958 --> 09:22.208
- Don't you like it?
- No.

09:22.208 --> 09:26.125
I'll get you one.
What's your size, 44 regular?

09:26.708 --> 09:29.125
I mean, you're little bit slimmer, no?

09:29.125 --> 09:30.291
Shut up.

09:30.291 --> 09:31.625
I missed you, too.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.375
He wanted to pull the plug.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.375
Nah, that's not true. She lies.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.333
You would have been doing me a favor.

09:38.333 --> 09:39.833
Next time. You have my word.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.708
It's funny,
your sister said the same thing.

09:56.416 --> 09:57.500
What the hell's this?

09:59.208 --> 10:00.500
A gift.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.250
You're welcome.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.750
You bring my chickens?

10:05.750 --> 10:06.875
We ate them.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.208
- What about my dog?
-  Oh, we ate her, too.

10:10.208 --> 10:12.000
Jesus, Yaz.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.958
I'm joking. She's in the house.

10:16.416 --> 10:19.791
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Anything you want.

10:19.791 --> 10:23.000
I mean, you could go on hikes,
learn to knit.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.541
You know, try to reach mindfulness.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.250
You're gonna like it here.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.958
All right, brother.
I'll send you that shirt.

10:34.666 --> 10:35.875
What's this?

10:35.875 --> 10:39.208
We packed up your house.
This is all we found.

10:40.125 --> 10:43.041
Your entire life fits in one little box.

10:45.791 --> 10:47.708
Maybe it's time to change that.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.541
When am I going to see you again?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.791
When we have something to celebrate.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.333
Enjoy retirement!

11:12.583 --> 11:13.666
Yeah, piss off.

11:28.708 --> 11:31.500
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

11:34.791 --> 11:36.833
I wouldn't let 'em eat you, mate.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.291
Fucking right.

13:47.166 --> 13:50.458
Don't wake them.
It's hard for them to fall asleep in here.

13:51.958 --> 13:53.083
Come.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.416
No.

13:55.125 --> 13:55.958
No?

13:57.125 --> 13:58.083
Not tonight.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.875
It's been weeks
since they've seen the sun.

14:02.458 --> 14:06.125
They can't survive like this.
It's hard on them.

14:06.125 --> 14:07.375
Hard?

14:08.625 --> 14:09.875
He needs to grow up hard.

14:09.875 --> 14:12.291
There are other places to hide.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.125
Sure, in here your brother protects us.

14:15.125 --> 14:17.458
But I don't want my son
to become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

14:17.458 --> 14:20.041
The last thing I need is your fat mouth.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.500
What are you going to do?

14:22.416 --> 14:24.333
Drag me into your cell?

14:24.916 --> 14:27.083
You forgetting you're my wife?

14:27.083 --> 14:29.333
Not your property.

14:30.583 --> 14:33.125
Maybe I raise them on my own, huh?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.875
You would not be missed.

15:03.333 --> 15:06.041
Mom, you okay?

15:07.583 --> 15:09.000
I thought you were sleeping.

15:20.625 --> 15:23.125
- Are you sure you are okay?
- I'm fine.

15:28.666 --> 15:29.583
I'm sorry.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.291
It's okay, my love.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.291
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

15:39.375 --> 15:40.666
Maybe Dad is right.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.166
I do need to grow up hard.

15:46.583 --> 15:47.916
So I can become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

16:19.666 --> 16:22.833
This is beautiful, honestly, but the tea?

16:22.833 --> 16:24.000
Not so much.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.375
You're out of milk, by the way.

16:27.916 --> 16:28.958
You lost, mate?

16:31.708 --> 16:32.833
Are you Rake?

16:33.625 --> 16:34.750
I asked you first.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.375
Yeah, but my answer depends on yours.

16:37.375 --> 16:40.666
See, if you are Rake,
then you are the myth of Mumbai.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.166
The legend that got
the journalist out of Congo,

16:43.166 --> 16:46.125
that took down the two gangs
to save the mayor of Rio.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.625
The honor would be all mine.

16:47.625 --> 16:50.250
But I have to say, mate,
you're not living up to the hype.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.666
What happened? You fall off a bridge?

16:53.250 --> 16:57.416
How about you put my cup down,
hop in your car, and fuck off?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.500
That's not very nice, is it?

17:01.333 --> 17:04.750
Not when we've got a mutual friend
who's offered you a job.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.125
I don't have any friends.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.541
Yeah, well, this particular individual
seems to think

17:09.541 --> 17:11.708
you're the only one that can do it.

17:11.708 --> 17:16.625
Me? I'm not so convinced.
Can you even pull the trigger like that?

17:19.958 --> 17:22.375
Now that's why
you haven't got any friends.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.333
Why don't you go back and tell
whoever sent you that I'm not interested.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.125
Yeah?

17:31.916 --> 17:34.958
What if it was your ex-wife? Mia.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.666
Is that dog wearing a Valentino shirt?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.791
Yeah. A friend gave it to me.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.333
So, Mia in trouble?

17:52.583 --> 17:54.166
No. But her sister is.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.541
What's she caught up in?

17:55.541 --> 17:58.875
Well, she's currently in a Georgian prison
with her two kids.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.750
Her husband's locked her in there.
Can you imagine that?

18:01.750 --> 18:04.583
- His name's, uh, Davit--
- Davit Radiani. I remember him.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.416
Probably the last time you saw him,

18:06.416 --> 18:09.750
he and his brother Zurab were pushing
dime bags on the streets of Georgia.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.458
But eight years later,
they've built quite an empire.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.458
Call themselves the <i>Nagazi.</i>

18:15.291 --> 18:17.125
It means shepherd, apparently.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.000
The brothers were born into war.

18:21.541 --> 18:23.375
<i>Raised in it. Hardened by it.</i>

18:24.208 --> 18:26.833
<i>When they were kids,
they fled the civil war in Georgia,</i>

18:26.833 --> 18:28.458
<i>with only their lives</i>

18:28.458 --> 18:30.000
<i>and escaped to Armenia.</i>

18:31.333 --> 18:33.750
<i>Their uncle, Avtandil, took them in.</i>

18:33.750 --> 18:36.125
<i>To this day, he runs operations for them.</i>

18:36.875 --> 18:39.416
<i>But in Armenia,
they faced a new kind of war.</i>

18:40.958 --> 18:44.333
<i>To survive the streets of Yerevan,
they turned to a life of crime.</i>

18:45.250 --> 18:48.958
<i>Started running drugs in their teens,
graduated to murder for hire.</i>

18:49.958 --> 18:53.000
<i>They believed they were soldiers,
chosen by God.</i>

18:53.791 --> 18:55.666
<i>By the time they returned to Georgia,</i>

18:56.375 --> 18:57.625
<i>they were folk heroes.</i>

18:57.625 --> 19:02.666
<i>They offered their recruits
a very powerful thing... family.</i>

19:03.875 --> 19:06.291
<i>And so the brothers gained
a cult-like loyalty.</i>

19:06.958 --> 19:09.208
And with that,
they basically built themselves

19:09.208 --> 19:11.833
a billion-dollar heroin
and weapons operation.

19:11.833 --> 19:14.750
These brothers have got
all the politicians in their pockets.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.791
They practically run the country.

19:16.791 --> 19:19.791
If it wasn't for the Americans,
Davit would be free.

19:19.791 --> 19:20.791
Location?

19:20.791 --> 19:22.458
They're in the Tkachiri Prison.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.916
Now listen to me, pal,
and listen to me really good.

19:25.916 --> 19:29.666
In my expert opinion,
the problem isn't Davit or the guards,

19:29.666 --> 19:32.541
it's the two warring gangs
that are imprisoned in there,

19:32.541 --> 19:36.375
one of which would just wanna kill her,
but both of which'll wanna kill you.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.000
Now, if I were you,
which I'm obviously not,

19:39.000 --> 19:42.291
I'd want to get in there nice and quiet,
keep my head down,

19:42.291 --> 19:45.208
because the moment Davit finds out
that his family's been taken,

19:45.208 --> 19:48.833
you can rest assured that his brother
is gonna wanna throw everything at you,

19:48.833 --> 19:51.166
and I'm talking
about the whole <i>Nagazi</i> army.

19:53.208 --> 19:54.500
Sounds fun.

20:00.375 --> 20:02.541
Job starts in six weeks. We take our cut,

20:02.541 --> 20:06.250
and for, uh, political considerations,
you're on your own.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.833
If all goes well,
you don't get caught or shot in the face,

20:08.833 --> 20:11.291
I'll meet you on the other side
and give you a kiss.

20:11.291 --> 20:14.333
Failing that? It's been a pleasure.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.708
 We can get a shipment
of weapons to Seoul by tomorrow night.

20:24.708 --> 20:27.833
And my brother Yaz
will fly there to deliver it personally.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.666
I have tickets to the game tomorrow.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.125
Sorry, I have to call you back.

20:43.291 --> 20:44.541
Tyler.

20:44.541 --> 20:46.583
<i>Yeah, hey, Nik. So listen,</i>

20:47.333 --> 20:49.708
the whole retirement thing
is not gonna work out.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.083
<i>Job came in.</i>

20:51.083 --> 20:53.250
You were clinically dead nine months ago.

20:53.250 --> 20:57.125
Yeah, well, I'm not now. Money should be
in your account pretty soon.

20:57.125 --> 21:00.291
What are you talking about?
Why did they come to you?

21:00.291 --> 21:03.375
Haven't you heard, Nik?
I'm a bit of a legend now.

21:04.833 --> 21:07.791
I think being in a coma
must have messed with your memory.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.125
<i>I</i> tell you what the job is
and when and how you do it.

21:11.125 --> 21:14.416
Yeah, you also told me to find the reason
I fought my way back.

21:17.458 --> 21:18.375
Let's find out.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.875
You're gonna miss the game.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.666
Fucking hell.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.875
<i>One minute to target.</i>

22:47.916 --> 22:50.500
You know,
my hands are super sweaty lately.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.458
I don't like it.
Probably, have low blood sugar.

22:53.458 --> 22:54.833
How do you know that?

22:54.833 --> 22:57.833
- Saw it on TikTok.
- You need to get off medical TikTok.

22:57.833 --> 23:00.083
-  You're already edgy.
- I need to talk.

23:00.083 --> 23:02.416
Every time I talk,
the phone hears me,

23:02.416 --> 23:04.083
and I get more medical TikToks.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.375
Then you should delete TikTok.

23:06.375 --> 23:08.000
Well, that's a terrible idea.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.708
-  Are you ready?
- Let's go.

23:13.375 --> 23:16.083
<i>All teams, eyes on.
Looking good.</i>

23:19.000 --> 23:21.041
Freezing out there.

23:21.041 --> 23:24.625
They don't want to sleep in the cold,
they shouldn't kill people for a living.

23:41.583 --> 23:45.083
<i>Phoenix is at Alpha.
Teams two and three standing by.</i>

23:59.625 --> 24:02.791
207 unlocked.
You got five minutes.

24:30.500 --> 24:35.208
<i>Power is out everywhere.</i>

24:35.208 --> 24:37.125
Going to check it out.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.125
Hey.

25:09.250 --> 25:12.125
Sandro, wake up.
We have to go. Get dressed.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.708
Who is this man?

25:15.708 --> 25:18.000
He's going to take us out of here.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.375
Put your shoes on.

25:29.250 --> 25:30.916
Where are we going?

25:31.625 --> 25:33.666
I'll tell you later.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.291
Dad?

25:41.291 --> 25:43.500
Shh! Keep him quiet.

25:43.500 --> 25:47.250
He's getting us out of here.
Your father's waiting outside.

25:47.250 --> 25:48.791
Stay close.

25:55.791 --> 25:56.750
Go.

25:58.833 --> 26:01.041
- Package in hand. On the move.
-  <i>Copy.</i>

26:06.666 --> 26:07.625
Sorry, kid.

26:10.416 --> 26:11.375
Move.

26:33.916 --> 26:37.208
<i>Code Red.
Security, lock down the exits.</i>

26:39.458 --> 26:44.250
<i>Security breach. All guards, Code Red.</i>

26:47.958 --> 26:51.083
<i>Alert, perimeter breached.
Close down the exits.</i>

26:51.083 --> 26:53.666
You'll have to get off your asses.
It's getting busy.

26:53.666 --> 26:55.041
<i>Roger. We're ready.</i>

26:58.291 --> 27:00.666
Fuck! Back, back! Back! In there! Move!

27:03.375 --> 27:04.208
Don't push me.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.291
You're scaring him.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.833
Yeah, well, he's about to be terrified.

27:07.833 --> 27:11.333
<i>Alert,
perimeter breached. Close down the exits.</i>

27:23.500 --> 27:24.708
Stand back.

27:25.958 --> 27:27.041
Stay back.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.083
Fuck off.

27:45.416 --> 27:46.291
Back off!

27:58.583 --> 27:59.666
Go, go, go, go!

28:16.166 --> 28:17.458
Yaz, I need a way out.

28:17.458 --> 28:18.541
<i>Working on it.</i>

28:42.708 --> 28:44.166
Which way, Yaz? I need some help.

28:44.166 --> 28:48.375
<i>Forget Bravo. Too hot. Go left.
To the coal chutes, coal chutes.</i>

28:48.375 --> 28:49.458
Roger. Moving.

28:57.625 --> 29:00.458
- Which way? I'm guessing up?
-  <i>Yep. ETA two minutes.</i>

29:09.666 --> 29:12.250
Don't be afraid.
Go up, and I'll come up too.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.458
Let's go.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.166
Okay.

29:21.750 --> 29:24.875
Where are you
taking my children? Motherfucker!

29:31.666 --> 29:33.083
You bitch.

31:01.791 --> 31:03.958
Tyler. We've gotta go now.

31:07.541 --> 31:09.250
Take the kids, meet me at Charlie!

31:11.583 --> 31:13.666
- What happened down there?
- Trouble.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.500
Come on, let's go.

31:18.791 --> 31:20.458
- Where's my father?
-  Come on.

31:20.458 --> 31:23.166
-  We gotta go, hold her.
- Where's my father?

31:24.250 --> 31:26.583
All teams move to Charlie. Now! Now!

31:32.750 --> 31:36.875
<i>Alert,
riot in the square. Lock down the exits.</i>

31:36.875 --> 31:41.083
<i>Alert, riot in the square.
Lock down the exits.</i>

31:45.500 --> 31:49.083
<i>Alert, all units to the prison courtyard.
Close down all the exits.</i>

31:54.208 --> 31:57.875
<i>Code Red. Security, lock down the exits.</i>

32:18.875 --> 32:21.375
Any route to Charlie that isn't through
the common yard?

32:21.375 --> 32:22.708
<i>Negative, negative.</i>

32:23.625 --> 32:24.833
- Shit.
- Not through it.

32:24.833 --> 32:26.250
There must be another way.

32:26.250 --> 32:28.416
Stay close to me.
Keep swinging that thing.

32:28.416 --> 32:33.166
<i>Close all gates. Guards, get to the walls.</i>

32:50.333 --> 32:51.250
Go!

32:55.208 --> 33:01.000
Back off! Move! Back! Back! Back!

33:35.625 --> 33:37.250
Rake! Help me!

33:48.375 --> 33:50.000
- Rake!

34:04.666 --> 34:05.666
Rake!

34:34.500 --> 34:35.541
Pull the pin!

34:46.458 --> 34:47.750
- Hey!

35:14.958 --> 35:15.958
Help me!

35:17.916 --> 35:18.750
No!

35:21.416 --> 35:22.500
Help me!

35:41.458 --> 35:42.291
Tyler!

35:44.208 --> 35:45.125
Help me!

35:53.708 --> 35:54.708
You all right?

35:55.625 --> 35:57.125
We're at Charlie. Open up.

35:57.125 --> 35:59.875
<i>Stand clear.
Breaching in three, two, one...</i>

36:03.333 --> 36:04.791
What took you so long?

36:05.916 --> 36:09.125
- Word's out. We got to move.
- The word's been out for a while.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.125
We intercepted <i>Nagazi</i> radio calls.
They're coming at us heavily armed.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.916
And they know their boss is dead.

36:13.916 --> 36:16.208
- Does the brother know?
- We're about to find out.

36:17.708 --> 36:18.791
Where are the kids?

36:18.791 --> 36:20.750
In the car. Move. Go.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.166
Hold on.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.458
All right, everyone okay? Kids, you good?

36:41.208 --> 36:43.666
Where's Father?
You told me he was coming.

36:43.666 --> 36:45.333
He'll meet us later.

36:48.833 --> 36:51.416
All right, put those on.
Get on the floor.

36:54.166 --> 36:55.291
Shit.

36:55.291 --> 36:57.333
Eyes up. Threat coming from the front.

36:57.333 --> 36:59.708
-  <i>Roger.</i>
-  Those are Zurab's men.

37:03.708 --> 37:06.125
<i>Team three, move up.
Tyler, we got your six.</i>

37:06.125 --> 37:08.291
Got it. Nik, get rid of these guys.

37:08.291 --> 37:09.375
<i>Already on it.</i>

37:19.125 --> 37:21.166
<i>One threat down. One threat down.</i>

37:31.291 --> 37:34.666
<i>Okay, we just pushed the last two
of them down. Drive, drive, drive.</i>

37:39.083 --> 37:40.125
<i>Maintain formation.</i>

37:40.125 --> 37:41.666
-  <i>Copy.</i>
-  <i>Copy.</i>

37:46.791 --> 37:49.125
<i>Contact front,
turn right, turn right.</i>

37:50.083 --> 37:51.250
Son of a bitch.

37:55.500 --> 37:59.333
<i>Shit. We got multiple bikes,
and then an armed UTV, military-grade.</i>

37:59.333 --> 38:01.250
Stack up.
Don't let them between us.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.291
<i>Nagazi</i> are here.
Soldiers. These men are killers.

38:04.291 --> 38:05.625
Yeah, so am I.

38:25.333 --> 38:26.583
<i>We're hit!</i>

38:30.583 --> 38:32.041
<i>Eagle's down.</i>

38:34.333 --> 38:35.750
<i>Keep those bikes off me.</i>

38:40.375 --> 38:43.125
- They must know about Davit.
- Yeah, feels that way.

38:43.125 --> 38:44.833
What do they know?

38:53.416 --> 38:54.625
Second bike down.

39:00.458 --> 39:03.500
- Why are Uncle's men shooting at us?
- Are you okay?

39:08.291 --> 39:10.208
<i>Nik, you got the last two bikes.</i>

39:10.208 --> 39:12.250
<i>Keep them on your tail.
I'm coming in quick.</i>

39:15.666 --> 39:16.541
<i>Hurry!</i>

39:20.166 --> 39:21.625
<i>That fast enough?</i>

39:21.625 --> 39:23.500
<i>Is that supposed to be funny?</i>

39:25.541 --> 39:26.958
<i>UTV on our left.</i>

39:26.958 --> 39:28.750
<i>Approaching exfil, straight ahead.</i>

39:28.750 --> 39:29.916
Hang on tight!

39:38.458 --> 39:40.625
Don't they know we're in this car?

39:40.625 --> 39:43.166
Bravo team, we're two mikes out--

39:48.166 --> 39:50.000
-  Shit!

39:57.125 --> 39:58.041
Fuck!

40:00.291 --> 40:02.916
-  Look out, come on. Come on.
-  Go, move.

40:02.916 --> 40:03.916
Reloading!

40:04.833 --> 40:08.291
Okay, I've got you.

40:08.291 --> 40:10.791
- The girl's hurt! We gotta move.
-  Okay.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.250
Push right through that door.
On foot. Sixty seconds out.

40:31.833 --> 40:32.791
Take a left!

40:36.208 --> 40:38.333
Right! Go right! Follow me.

40:47.541 --> 40:49.291
Come on, guys. Keep it tight.

40:53.958 --> 40:57.791
Team four! We're on foot.
Twenty seconds out.

41:04.166 --> 41:06.458
-  Yaz, slow them down.
-  All right.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.000
Friendly coming through.

41:30.250 --> 41:31.791
Yaz, get us a med kit.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.500
All right. Got it.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.750
It hurts!

41:43.458 --> 41:44.458
How bad is it?

41:45.833 --> 41:48.166
Open fracture.
She needs a doctor.

41:48.166 --> 41:50.291
<i>Heads up,
got gunships en route.</i>

41:50.291 --> 41:51.500
Heading to the engine.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.833
- Yaz, need you to take over.
- Okay, got it.

42:44.750 --> 42:46.500
Got one helo, one's still there.

42:46.500 --> 42:47.750
<i>Copy.</i>

43:13.958 --> 43:16.208
<i>Reaper Team, in position.</i>

43:16.708 --> 43:18.166
<i>Move, move.</i>

43:26.250 --> 43:28.916
<i>Reaper 1 and 2,
you have to stop this train.</i>

43:28.916 --> 43:31.250
<i>Copy, moving toward the engine.</i>

43:33.416 --> 43:34.250
<i>Go, go!</i>

44:25.291 --> 44:26.583
<i>Reaper 1 is down.</i>

44:27.125 --> 44:27.958
<i>Breaching!</i>

45:47.625 --> 45:48.625
Nik, you good?

45:50.041 --> 45:50.916
Nik?

46:05.875 --> 46:07.125
You okay?

46:07.125 --> 46:08.375
Better than him.

46:10.916 --> 46:12.250
Shit, get down!

46:20.791 --> 46:21.833
Cover me.

46:48.166 --> 46:50.916
We're reaching the end of the line.
Stop the train, Nik.

46:50.916 --> 46:51.916
Brakes are out.

46:51.916 --> 46:53.041
You're kidding me.

46:56.125 --> 46:58.625
Yaz, secure the family. We got no brakes.

47:09.083 --> 47:10.625
- We're almost there.
-  Hold on.

47:10.625 --> 47:13.000
My team's waiting for us
at the end of the line.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.708
Gonna be a rough landing, hold on tight.

47:14.708 --> 47:18.041
-  What's going on?
-  Figure it out later.

48:31.791 --> 48:33.000
I'm sorry.

48:35.250 --> 48:37.541
This was deeply resourced.

48:37.541 --> 48:39.750
Lead operative was A-plus.

48:39.750 --> 48:43.500
There's maybe four or five guys
who could've done this to us.

48:43.500 --> 48:44.833
Was this the Chechens?

48:44.833 --> 48:46.708
It's not their style.

48:46.708 --> 48:48.625
They don't organize like this.

48:49.250 --> 48:50.958
Someone wanted revenge.

48:50.958 --> 48:53.500
With your brother, that's no short list.

48:54.250 --> 48:55.083
No.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.583
This wasn't revenge.

49:02.791 --> 49:04.125
This was something else.

49:23.250 --> 49:24.208
It's all right.

49:31.416 --> 49:33.041
- Careful with her arm.
- Got it.

49:37.166 --> 49:38.791
Where's Father?

49:38.791 --> 49:41.416
There isn't time for this.
Your sister needs help.

49:41.416 --> 49:42.625
I'm not leaving without him.

49:42.625 --> 49:45.083
- Come on. Your sister needs help.
- I'm not going.

49:45.083 --> 49:47.583
Your father isn't coming.

49:50.875 --> 49:52.083
Is he dead?

49:58.666 --> 50:00.166
Did you kill him?

50:01.291 --> 50:02.541
Huh?

50:02.541 --> 50:04.041
Did you kill him?

50:09.375 --> 50:10.958
Please, Sandro.

50:15.666 --> 50:17.166
Oh, Sandro.

50:20.708 --> 50:22.500
- Listen to me! Hey, hey!
- Fuck you!

50:22.500 --> 50:25.208
Listen to me!
He was gonna kill your mother. Okay?

50:25.208 --> 50:26.500
It was him or her.

50:31.416 --> 50:32.500
Sandro.

51:32.791 --> 51:34.208
Davit!

51:35.666 --> 51:39.125
- I tried to protect him.
-  Is this protection?

51:40.458 --> 51:43.750
You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood.

52:06.958 --> 52:08.875
Full medical detail.

52:09.541 --> 52:11.375
I need you to meet us
at Donau-City Strasse.

52:12.125 --> 52:14.250
We touch down
in 45 minutes in Vienna.

52:15.291 --> 52:16.291
Thank you.

52:21.125 --> 52:22.250
We're almost there.

52:24.166 --> 52:26.916
You all right? Need anything?

52:28.583 --> 52:29.541
I'm hungry.

52:31.208 --> 52:32.625
Let me see what we got.

52:38.833 --> 52:41.000
Don't. She could aspirate.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.875
I know how to take care of my child.

52:42.875 --> 52:45.625
Calm down.
She's just trying to help.

52:45.625 --> 52:47.083
Don't patronize me.

52:47.083 --> 52:49.750
A doctor will be there when we land.
Try to rest.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.750
Since when do you speak Georgian?

52:52.250 --> 52:53.083
Since always.

52:54.083 --> 52:55.458
She doesn't know?

52:57.208 --> 52:58.916
He was married to my sister.

53:05.500 --> 53:06.958
Thanks for the heads-up.

53:06.958 --> 53:09.291
I was going to tell you when we landed.

53:09.291 --> 53:10.208
Mmm.

53:19.458 --> 53:21.083
You are a brave girl.

53:41.583 --> 53:42.833
She's mad at you.

53:42.833 --> 53:44.958
It's not unusual.

53:48.791 --> 53:50.208
I should have stayed behind.

53:51.458 --> 53:53.458
My children would be safer with me dead.

53:53.458 --> 53:56.916
Hey, come on. You know that's not true.

53:57.666 --> 53:59.625
We're almost there. You're almost free.

54:00.125 --> 54:02.500
I'm gonna get you some place safe.
I promise.

54:03.875 --> 54:05.291
Thank you, Tyler.

54:24.708 --> 54:25.833
I'm listening.

54:26.541 --> 54:28.916
Uncle... It's me, Sandro.

54:28.916 --> 54:31.000
Sandro? Where are you?

54:32.833 --> 54:34.833
Was my father going to kill my mother?

54:37.291 --> 54:38.125
Sandro--

54:38.125 --> 54:39.291
Answer me!

54:41.375 --> 54:43.958
Don't listen to anything your mother says,
you understand me?

54:45.416 --> 54:46.833
She did this.

54:47.916 --> 54:50.375
She had your father killed. Understand?

54:52.625 --> 54:55.583
She has wanted to take you away
from your father for years.

54:57.250 --> 55:00.000
<i>And now you are with the man
who killed him.</i>

55:01.666 --> 55:02.791
<i>So where are you?</i>

55:06.416 --> 55:08.333
You're a <i>Nagazi.</i> Be your father's son.

55:10.208 --> 55:12.041
Where are you heading?

55:15.500 --> 55:16.958
<i>Where are you heading?</i>

55:25.041 --> 55:27.916
Remember when
I first met you in Brussels?

55:27.916 --> 55:29.875
Mia was working for Parliament.

55:31.083 --> 55:32.750
Yeah, you had your boy with you.

55:34.291 --> 55:35.500
I was 19.

55:36.291 --> 55:39.916
He was just a baby. So was I.

55:43.458 --> 55:45.875
Listen, I know what your sister
must think of me.

55:45.875 --> 55:49.416
There's nothing I can do to fix that.
I just want you to know that--

55:49.416 --> 55:51.916
It's the most awful thing
a parent can endure,

55:51.916 --> 55:53.416
watching a child die.

56:57.541 --> 56:58.958
Thank you.

57:05.625 --> 57:08.791
Okay, let's hustle.
I need them on a plane in six hours.

57:10.208 --> 57:11.416
Multiple visas.

57:11.416 --> 57:12.541
<i>Merci.</i>

57:14.041 --> 57:15.250
That's nice.

57:19.708 --> 57:21.083
You should get some rest.

57:22.416 --> 57:23.583
Papers are in motion.

57:34.541 --> 57:35.833
Why didn't you tell me?

57:41.916 --> 57:42.833
I'm sorry--

57:42.833 --> 57:45.666
I don't need your apology.
I need your trust.

57:50.625 --> 57:53.375
I wouldn't have said no to this.

57:54.791 --> 57:56.291
If it was important to you.

57:59.416 --> 58:00.416
It is.

58:06.666 --> 58:07.958
Thank you, doctor.

58:27.458 --> 58:29.458
I can't imagine what it must have taken

58:29.458 --> 58:31.791
to raise good kids
surrounded by those men.

58:33.375 --> 58:34.708
But you survived.

58:36.208 --> 58:37.916
You kept your kids from harm.

58:38.833 --> 58:42.750
Found a way with nothing. Alone.

58:47.458 --> 58:50.958
I know what it feels like.
I've been there.

58:57.833 --> 58:59.791
Everyone deserves a second chance.

59:15.125 --> 59:16.666
You think what you do is good?

59:20.041 --> 59:21.416
You think you saved me?

59:22.875 --> 59:24.125
That you're some hero?

59:25.583 --> 59:29.666
Doesn't really matter what I think.
People pay me to do things they can't.

59:30.166 --> 59:31.625
Like killing my father.

59:33.875 --> 59:36.000
My mother hired you to kill him.
Didn't she?

59:36.000 --> 59:39.208
No, what your mother did was risk
everything to protect you and your sister.

59:39.916 --> 59:42.291
Save you from that prison
that your father put you in.

59:42.291 --> 59:44.958
He didn't want to.
They'd have killed us on the outside.

59:44.958 --> 59:47.166
- Who?
- The enemies of the <i>Nagazi.</i>

59:47.166 --> 59:49.041
They'd have come for us and killed us.

59:49.041 --> 59:51.208
He brought us there,
so he could watch over us.

59:51.208 --> 59:55.291
- He brought you there to control you.
- No. He just didn't trust my mother.

59:55.291 --> 59:56.333
Wake up, kid.

59:56.333 --> 59:58.958
He knew she would take you and your sister

59:58.958 --> 01:00:01.958
and give you a life outside of all that,
not stay trapped with him.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:04.208
A good son
is supposed to stay with his father.

01:00:04.208 --> 01:00:08.000
- A good father wouldn't make him.
- At least my father didn't leave us.

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:33.250
It's the most
important thing I'll ever ask you to do.

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:36.125
To rectify this desecration.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.791
This filth came to our home
and murdered our family.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.458
Our brothers.

01:00:42.958 --> 01:00:45.958
By God's law, he must die by our hand.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:50.875
You are my brothers. My life is yours.

01:00:51.416 --> 01:00:54.375
I'll follow you to the end.

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.625
My life is yours.

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:58.166
And mine.

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:20.833
You're throwing their lives away.

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.958
This path doesn't end well.

01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:31.041
"You fight for your brother
till your last drop of blood."

01:01:31.958 --> 01:01:34.375
I haven't forgotten my father's lesson.

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:36.166
Have you?

01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:11.375
You and my son
met once before.

01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:14.041
Played on the beach together.
I don't know if you remember.

01:02:16.291 --> 01:02:18.250
He'd nearly be as old as you are now.

01:02:23.375 --> 01:02:24.416
Last time I saw him,

01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:26.916
he was sitting in a hospital bed
and drawing.

01:02:26.916 --> 01:02:29.708
He had papers and crayons
spread out everywhere.

01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:31.083
He used to love to draw.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.583
I came to say goodbye
'cause I was shipping out to Afghanistan,

01:02:37.208 --> 01:02:41.083
and I knew I might not see him again,
he might not be alive when I got back.

01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:47.208
So I came to the hospital,
and there he was on the bed, drawing.

01:02:52.666 --> 01:02:54.250
And you're right, I...

01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:01.416
And I left.

01:03:06.875 --> 01:03:09.708
Last thing my kid remembers
is me walking out on him.

01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:15.416
But your mom, she stayed.

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:19.833
She stayed with your father for years
to keep you safe.

01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:23.625
Even after all the things he did to her,
what you did and didn't see.

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:26.875
She stayed to keep you
and your sister safe.

01:03:28.375 --> 01:03:31.125
I'm not gonna lie to you, mate,
shit's gonna get harder,

01:03:31.125 --> 01:03:33.416
but you'll have to take care of her.
She's gonna need you.

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:37.375
So you can be there for her
like she was for you.

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:41.041
Or let your father's lies consume you.

01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:46.958
It's on you, mate.

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:54.458
He wasn't always like this.

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:01.458
I'm sorry.

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:04.125
- Nah, it's okay.
- No.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:06.750
He's coming.

01:04:21.833 --> 01:04:23.583
Oh, kid, what did you do?

01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:28.791
Attack team from north side. Move!

01:04:28.791 --> 01:04:30.291
Pack it up. Let's go.

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:33.041
- We gotta move.
- What's going on?

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:34.166
They found us.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:47.791
Take the elevator down.
Walk calmly out the front door.

01:05:01.916 --> 01:05:05.125
I'll get to the garage,
use the armored cars to punch through.

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:06.125
- Let's go.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.750
Up or down?

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.833
They'll come down. More options.

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:23.125
The children?

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:31.083
MEET ME IN THE BACK ALLEY.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.375
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry, Mama...

01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:46.250
Sandro... What did you do? How could you?!

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:48.708
He doesn't care about you!

01:05:48.708 --> 01:05:51.333
He's gonna kill us!

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:53.625
The <i>Nagazi</i> are my family.

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:06.833
I am your family.
Nina is your family!

01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:16.375
-  Get down!
-  Get down!

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:45.875
Come on.

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:49.041
Chopper on the roof.
They're pinching us in.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:51.708
Let's go! Come on. Move. Move.

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:33.041
- We'll punch a hole. Break you through.
- Thank you.

01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:34.541
Go. Get in the car.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:48.416
Sandro!

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:51.000
- Sandro! Kid, wait!
- I got him.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.083
Yaz! No!

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:54.166
Shit.

01:07:55.291 --> 01:07:58.250
- He's going to his uncle.
- Nik, stay in radio contact.

01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:27.375
We need backup!

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:40.125
- Keep going, Nik. Get the boy.
- Tyler...

01:08:41.708 --> 01:08:42.666
Heads down.

01:08:49.583 --> 01:08:51.333
Hey! Come here!

01:08:54.833 --> 01:08:55.666
Hey!

01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:58.458
Come back here.

01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:07.708
Sandro.

01:09:09.291 --> 01:09:10.833
Come on, kid. Come back.

01:09:11.958 --> 01:09:14.208
Hey, kid, trust me.
You don't want to do that.

01:09:14.208 --> 01:09:15.500
Come, boy.

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.750
Come back to your mother.

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:20.541
Don't listen to him.

01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:24.041
Your mother did all this
to protect you. Come back.

01:09:25.208 --> 01:09:26.458
Come back to us.

01:09:29.208 --> 01:09:30.125
Sandro.

01:09:31.958 --> 01:09:33.125
Come to your family.

01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:45.875
Shit!

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:54.458
Nik!

01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:01.583
- Nik, are you all right?

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:03.833
<i>Putain.</i>

01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:08.333
It wasn't my mother's fault.

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:10.500
She just wanted us to get out of there.

01:10:14.958 --> 01:10:16.958
Get in the car. Stay here.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.333
Watch the boy.

01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:23.291
Go!

01:10:32.833 --> 01:10:34.125
Frag out.

01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:33.875
- You all right?

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:36.291
Tyler, he's got the kid.
Nik and I are on foot.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:38.083
Heading streetside. We need evac.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.375
Hold on.

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:47.208
Team three, take them out. Quick.

01:12:07.666 --> 01:12:09.500
They're up top.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.375
Force them back into the building.

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.708
Tyler, we're pinned down!
Hurry up!

01:12:30.708 --> 01:12:32.375
<i>Coming to you.</i>

01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:43.041
<i>Pin him in!</i>

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:58.583
Stay here.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.791
<i>Do we have
permission to engage?</i>

01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:11.041
<i>Shooters on the roof.</i>

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:13.083
<i>Cleared to engage.</i>

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:15.375
<i>Police!</i>

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:55.708
- Nik! Get to the roof. Take their wings.
- Copy.

01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:59.916
-  Ready? Move!
-  Go!

01:14:15.416 --> 01:14:16.750
Reload!

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:22.916
Stay with me.

01:14:46.541 --> 01:14:49.125
Tyler, we're at the elevator.
Coming to the roof.

01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:51.833
Move!

01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:06.166
We're heading up now.
We're right behind you.

01:15:06.166 --> 01:15:07.083
<i>Copy.</i>

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:09.875
<i>They're squeezing us in.
Secure the chopper.</i>

01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:12.666
<i>I'll sweep up from the floor below.
Split their focus.</i>

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:14.958
We'll clear out,
and all get matching shirts. Cool?

01:15:14.958 --> 01:15:16.333
And wear them this time.

01:15:16.333 --> 01:15:17.708
Not a chance.

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.416
- Team one, they're headed to you.
- We're ready.

01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:34.166
Sergo, Konstantine, secure the entrance.
Everyone else, up top.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:46.875
Hey.

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:48.375
You okay?

01:15:48.375 --> 01:15:51.041
- You're gonna be okay.

01:15:53.875 --> 01:15:54.958
I am sorry.

01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:58.500
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

01:15:59.166 --> 01:16:00.541
-  Hey.

01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:02.375
There's nothing to be sorry about.

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:05.750
We'll get you out of here, okay?
Gonna get you back to your sister.

01:16:15.166 --> 01:16:17.125
Is he going to kill my mother?

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:22.833
If you wanted her alive,

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:25.541
you shouldn't have called.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:16.916
Yaz! Need you on the 57th floor.
South side.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:18.875
Stay here.

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:22.041
Go get the family. I got this.

01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:22.958
Go!

01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:51.000
I'm going to enjoy killing you.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.125
Yeah, get in line.

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:01.708
You must really care for this woman.

01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:06.125
Good.

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:10.083
Now you know how it feels
to lose someone you love.

01:20:28.875 --> 01:20:30.125
Do you trust me?

01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:31.625
Should I not?

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:42.708
Get the family.

01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:14.416
Traitor!

01:21:27.791 --> 01:21:29.750
- Yaz!

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.791
Yeah. Are you good?

01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:35.125
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:37.291
Let's go. Let's go.

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:39.375
Go, go.

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:31.291
Got the family. Heading up.

01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:32.375
On my way.

01:22:39.625 --> 01:22:41.375
Let's go. Let's go.

01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:54.666
Yaz?

01:22:59.416 --> 01:23:00.666
Shit.

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.333
Yaz.

01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:10.291
Get us up, Nik! Get us up!

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:38.208
Tyler, what's going on?

01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:40.541
Keep us flying, Nik. Just keep us flying.

01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:43.416
-  I got you.
- I can't breathe.

01:23:43.416 --> 01:23:45.000
- Sorry. Okay--
- Yaz!

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.333
Look, buddy, hey. Yaz! Yaz!

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:49.208
Yaz, look at me, buddy. Eyes on me.

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:51.416
Okay, you stay with me, buddy. I got you!

01:23:54.166 --> 01:23:55.000
Yeah, man...

01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:59.750
Yaz!

01:24:34.875 --> 01:24:37.500
No!

01:25:17.416 --> 01:25:18.541
What happened?

01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:04.125
- Mia!
- Keto.

01:28:05.250 --> 01:28:06.375
- Mia.
- Keto.

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.541
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:28:42.375 --> 01:28:44.541
The whole country is looking for us.

01:28:46.166 --> 01:28:47.958
Then go, get on the plane.

01:28:56.291 --> 01:28:57.916
We lost ten <i>Nagazi</i> today.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.875
Good soldiers.

01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:01.500
It's enough.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.958
Don't be afraid.

01:29:03.916 --> 01:29:04.833
It'll be fine.

01:29:09.666 --> 01:29:11.916
Be an example to Sandro.

01:29:13.083 --> 01:29:14.958
You're no good to him dead,

01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:16.833
or rotting in an Austrian prison.

01:29:16.833 --> 01:29:19.708
How can I be an example to Sandro,

01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:21.541
if I run away?

01:29:22.416 --> 01:29:24.250
Let's ask God.

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:37.666
"Fear not, for I'm with you."

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:42.250
"The Lord is near to the brokenhearted."

01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:43.541
I know, I've read it.

01:29:45.833 --> 01:29:47.750
I once believed God took your hearing,

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:53.041
so he could whisper right into your ear.

01:29:54.958 --> 01:29:56.958
But now you only hear your rage.

01:29:58.375 --> 01:30:00.625
You know who my father
used to compare you to?

01:30:01.416 --> 01:30:03.708
Do you remember the cricket
from the movie?

01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:05.791
The one who sits on the boy's nose.

01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:07.708
Always chirping nonsense in his ear.

01:30:07.708 --> 01:30:09.833
Chirping and chirping, again and again.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.750
Do you remember it?

01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:15.250
And where is your father now?

01:30:18.541 --> 01:30:19.791
Where is your brother?

01:30:40.083 --> 01:30:42.458
I always knew
there was a bullet waiting for me,

01:30:43.833 --> 01:30:47.583
but not from your gun.

01:31:13.041 --> 01:31:14.166
Sweetheart.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.375
You got so big.

01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:22.291
Aunt Mia's going to take us
somewhere safe. Okay?

01:31:23.333 --> 01:31:24.916
Is Sandro coming?

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:48.000
Made you a coffee
if you want. Milk, two sugars.

01:31:56.458 --> 01:31:58.833
Look, if I had anyone else to ask,
I would have.

01:32:01.833 --> 01:32:05.375
Yeah, I know. It's, um... It's good.

01:32:07.916 --> 01:32:11.541
Look, I know you don't want to hear this...

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:16.916
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:26.208
I'm sorry I wasn't there.
I'm sorry I didn't stay. I should have...

01:32:26.833 --> 01:32:28.875
Should have been there for you, for him.

01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:32.125
You're right. I don't wanna hear it.

01:32:41.833 --> 01:32:43.291
Why didn't you stay?

01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:49.625
Why didn't you stay?

01:32:49.625 --> 01:32:54.250
Well, they needed me in, um...
in Kandahar and--

01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:55.500
We needed you.

01:32:56.083 --> 01:32:58.250
- Because I was deployed--
- Why didn't you stay?

01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:00.791
- Well, I had orders, and... so I couldn't...
- Bullshit.

01:33:00.791 --> 01:33:02.833
- No, why didn't you stay?
- I couldn't...

01:33:05.875 --> 01:33:08.083
I couldn't fix it.
I couldn't fucking fix it.

01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:57.583
<i>I'm standing here,
staring at my plane.</i>

01:33:57.583 --> 01:34:00.000
<i>- But I can't get on it.
-</i> Yeah, why is that?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Because I could never live my life
knowing you're still around.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.250
Where's the boy?

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:06.375
<i>You think the boy
wants anything to do with you?</i>

01:34:06.375 --> 01:34:07.833
I think he's confused.

01:34:08.791 --> 01:34:11.583
Why don't you tell me where you are,
and we can finish what we started?

01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:13.083
Want to negotiate?

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:19.291
At the airfield. By St. George's Church.

01:34:19.291 --> 01:34:21.125
I'm not coming to negotiate.

01:34:51.708 --> 01:34:52.541
Don't do this.

01:34:52.541 --> 01:34:54.416
Stay with her. Get them out.

01:34:55.041 --> 01:34:57.375
Open the door. Open the door!

01:34:58.166 --> 01:34:59.125
Tyler!

01:36:08.166 --> 01:36:10.791
Sergo! Sergo!

01:36:55.166 --> 01:36:56.125
Hurry up.

01:38:04.708 --> 01:38:05.916
Come.

01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:08.750
You want the boy. Here he is.

01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:12.500
This is between me and you.
Let him go.

01:38:13.833 --> 01:38:15.166
No, he stays here.

01:38:16.666 --> 01:38:20.916
You know, God gave me a mission
to rain vengeance upon your head.

01:38:23.791 --> 01:38:26.958
Sometimes there is a great sacrifice
in enacting God's will.

01:38:32.458 --> 01:38:33.916
He's just a kid.

01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:36.041
Doubt me.

01:38:37.041 --> 01:38:40.083
Pull the trigger,
consume yourself in a lifetime of guilt.

01:38:44.083 --> 01:38:46.708
Life is slowly draining from your body.

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.083
I've had worse.

01:38:54.250 --> 01:38:55.833
Go. Take his gun.

01:38:58.833 --> 01:39:00.541
Don't make me tell you again.

01:39:13.083 --> 01:39:15.125
Give him the weapon.

01:39:31.208 --> 01:39:35.250
Now weigh the gun in your hand,
and point at his head.

01:39:39.666 --> 01:39:41.000
You're a coward.

01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:43.625
Coward?

01:39:45.666 --> 01:39:48.958
Cowardice is killing an unarmed man
in the bowels of a prison.

01:39:51.375 --> 01:39:53.291
I said to point the gun at him.

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:07.166
This is the man who killed your father.

01:40:09.291 --> 01:40:10.291
Avenge him.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.125
Pull the trigger.

01:40:35.125 --> 01:40:36.583
It's okay, mate.

01:41:03.291 --> 01:41:04.458
Disappointing.

01:41:19.125 --> 01:41:21.958
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:26.625
Oh, you can exact retribution
for your brother,

01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.666
but it will be at the cost
of <i>his</i> life right now.

01:41:30.666 --> 01:41:32.166
So put the gun down!

01:41:34.791 --> 01:41:37.125
I'm going to blow his asshole face off.

01:41:38.583 --> 01:41:39.791
Nik,

01:41:41.041 --> 01:41:42.125
the boy.

01:41:57.583 --> 01:41:58.541
Good girl.

01:41:58.541 --> 01:42:00.125
Fuck you.

01:43:47.625 --> 01:43:48.750
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:50.708
I'm so sorry.

01:44:46.041 --> 01:44:47.041
I will not...

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:48.833
stop.

01:47:22.208 --> 01:47:24.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:25.458
How are they?

01:47:26.125 --> 01:47:27.708
Good. Safe.

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:30.291
They're in witness protection.

01:47:30.291 --> 01:47:33.000
I helped her broker a deal
with the Americans.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.625
She gave them trade routes,
bank accounts, names.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:41.333
The Americans froze their assets though.
Took it all.

01:47:42.291 --> 01:47:45.291
If you go to my cabin in the third
floorboard back from the fireplace,

01:47:45.291 --> 01:47:47.958
there's a million in cash.
You can give it to them.

01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:56.583
I... I came here because I wanted--

01:47:56.583 --> 01:47:57.791
Thank you, Mia.

01:48:00.041 --> 01:48:01.375
I know, I never said that.

01:48:01.375 --> 01:48:04.666
I never said "thank you"
for doing what I... couldn't.

01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:14.208
His last image of you
wasn't you walking out on him.

01:48:15.375 --> 01:48:17.791
It was you going off to save people.

01:48:20.208 --> 01:48:22.750
And he was so brave, Tyler, when it ended.

01:48:24.166 --> 01:48:27.875
He said, "I want to be brave like Dad."

01:48:37.041 --> 01:48:38.750
That's how he saw you.

01:48:47.625 --> 01:48:48.708
Goodbye, Tyler.

01:49:47.541 --> 01:49:50.750
It's like the goddamn
<i>Sound of Music</i> out here. Isn't it?

01:49:56.958 --> 01:49:58.333
Told you not to get caught.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Shit happens, eh?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.416
What if I could get you out?

01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:04.208
How does that work?

01:50:05.041 --> 01:50:06.916
Come and do another job for us.

01:50:07.791 --> 01:50:10.166
Not without my team.
I'm not leaving her behind.

01:50:11.833 --> 01:50:13.791
Yeah. Thought you might say that.

01:50:34.625 --> 01:50:35.500
Rake.

01:50:36.125 --> 01:50:39.083
Rake. That's such a fun name to say.

01:50:39.916 --> 01:50:42.333
You never told me your name.
Is it as much fun?

01:50:43.166 --> 01:50:44.375
My name doesn't matter.

01:50:44.375 --> 01:50:45.875
Yeah? What does?

01:50:46.541 --> 01:50:47.750
Who I work for.

01:50:48.583 --> 01:50:49.791
Who's that?

01:50:50.375 --> 01:50:52.208
A gnarly motherfucker.

01:50:54.708 --> 01:50:55.750
You'll love him.
