00:45.612 --> 00:46.980
<i>Somebody told me once...</i>

00:46.981 --> 00:50.383
<i>that if you stand still
in the forest long enough...</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:53.486
<i>you'll see signs of
a hidden struggle.</i>

00:53.487 --> 00:57.290
<i>Raging between
forces of life and decay.</i>

00:57.291 --> 01:01.561
<i>That the survival of the forest
itself depends on the outcome.</i>

01:01.562 --> 01:04.798
<i>And that the good guys need
all the help they can get.</i>

01:04.799 --> 01:10.036
<i>And that if you don't believe
it, take a close look.</i>

01:10.037 --> 01:14.573
<i>And if you still don't,
look closer.</i>

01:28.321 --> 01:30.989
Oh! Oh!

01:30.990 --> 01:33.792
Mmm-hmm.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.498
Ah! Oh, oh, oh!

01:41.534 --> 01:43.469
Whoa! I...

01:58.017 --> 01:59.685
Oh!

03:17.230 --> 03:18.597
Whoa!

03:31.744 --> 03:33.046
Need a lift?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.347
I don't need your help!

03:34.348 --> 03:36.449
You're running out of
branch there, buddy.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.818
Still don't need your help.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.192
Whoa! Oh!

04:02.609 --> 04:04.010
Why aren't you with your group?

04:04.011 --> 04:05.445
What? I fly
faster alone!

04:05.446 --> 04:06.479
How do you not get this?

04:06.480 --> 04:08.248
You're not the only one
on this team, you know.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.416
So yell at one of them
for a change.

04:10.417 --> 04:14.120
You hear that? What am I
supposed to do with this kid?

04:14.121 --> 04:16.154
Ah, you're right.

04:16.156 --> 04:19.257
You've got your own problems.

04:21.861 --> 04:24.664
You're a Leafman. You know
how important today is.

04:24.665 --> 04:28.301
You know what? I'm thinking maybe
I'm just not cut out for this.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.470
That's the problem.
You are cut out for it.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.538
But I'm tired of waiting
for you to prove it.

04:32.539 --> 04:36.175
Get a bird and get back to
Moonhaven, or you're done.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.245
What, you're not
going to help me now?

04:39.246 --> 04:41.146
I just did.

04:42.348 --> 04:42.949
That's cool!

04:42.950 --> 04:45.184
I could probably
just jump from here!

04:45.185 --> 04:48.120
Just follow that last guy down!

04:53.059 --> 04:55.495
Whoa! Incoming.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.464
Bet they didn't have bugs
like that in the city.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.800
Yeah. I miss it already.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.035
She talks!

05:02.036 --> 05:03.770
Something on your mind, kid?

05:03.771 --> 05:05.638
What do you say
to a total stranger?

05:05.639 --> 05:09.208
Stranger? You and I go
back twenty minutes.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.078
Not you... Larry.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.513
I mean the person I'm visiting.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.416
I'm leaving you out here
with someone you don't know?

05:16.417 --> 05:20.820
It's okay, Lar.
We weren't always strangers.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.990
Maybe now things
will be different.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.792
<i>♪ And everyone says</i>

05:25.793 --> 05:29.329
<i>♪ This love will change you</i>

05:29.330 --> 05:30.363
<i>♪ Well, I ask</i>

05:30.364 --> 05:33.899
<i>♪ Does anything ever
stay the same?</i>

05:33.901 --> 05:37.437
<i>♪ No, no, no</i>

05:37.438 --> 05:42.040
<i>♪ It's strange changes</i>

05:43.443 --> 05:48.114
That's not a house, that's termites
holding hands. No offense.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.682
Don't worry, Lar. I'll
be...

05:49.683 --> 05:52.752
Call if you need
a quick getaway, kid!

05:52.753 --> 05:54.920
Fine.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.278
Hello?

06:22.248 --> 06:24.383
Anyone home?

06:35.161 --> 06:36.762
Hello?

06:46.006 --> 06:49.108
Okay. No, actually, you know what?
I should check this bee.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.644
No, that's
right there. Uh...

06:51.645 --> 06:55.114
Do we have... I had it
we... Oh, no, it's over here.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.916
Okay. Yeah.
Uh, let's see.

06:57.917 --> 06:58.818
Uh...

06:58.819 --> 07:00.253
Made of...
Oh, gosh!

07:00.254 --> 07:02.288
I don't know,
polished acorn shell

07:02.289 --> 07:04.424
and thin leather?
Perhaps mouse hide.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.324
Pardon me, excuse me, sorry.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.194
Correction: not mouse hide.
Shrew, perhaps.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.864
Or, you know what,
actually, it could be vole.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.598
Hi, Dad.
Oh!

07:15.535 --> 07:16.903
Mary Katherine!

07:16.904 --> 07:17.837
Yeah.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.205
You're here! Mmm!

07:20.506 --> 07:21.007
Yeah.

07:21.008 --> 07:24.042
I didn't realize
today was today.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.279
It always is.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.548
Hey, let me
look at you! Oh...

07:28.549 --> 07:32.585
You look just like your mother.
Like she did.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.421
You would, if you know
what I mean... Dad.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.056
Do you want to talk
about it, if that's...

07:37.057 --> 07:41.427
Thanks, but I've been reading
up on the five stages of grief.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.796
I'm working
through them myself.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.998
I'm good like that.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.567
There actually are a few things

07:47.568 --> 07:49.734
I would like to talk about.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.170
Oh, oh, oh! Ozzy!

07:53.339 --> 07:54.207
Look who's back!

07:54.208 --> 07:57.443
Ozzy?
He's still alive?

07:57.444 --> 07:58.544
Well, you know, most of him.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.214
He may be down to three legs, but
he'll make a break for it...

08:01.215 --> 08:03.316
the first chance he gets.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.786
Ozzy, go say hi.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.421
Here, boy!

08:08.422 --> 08:09.889
Ah, there he goes.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.457
His depth perception's
a little off...

08:11.458 --> 08:14.026
and he has a tendency
to run in circles.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.828
Hey, but that was closer
than usual, you know?

08:15.829 --> 08:19.297
He remembers you!

08:20.933 --> 08:24.904
So, I have a little
surprise for you up here.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.439
Just follow me, take a look.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.977
Ozzy! No. No kisses.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.445
Well, here we are.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.380
Welcome home.

08:36.716 --> 08:38.451
It's like I never left.

08:38.452 --> 08:42.221
All your things are here,
you got your dolls and...

08:42.222 --> 08:45.357
your pictures, your turtle.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.492
Oh, dear.

08:46.493 --> 08:50.663
Well, it's good to
have you back, Mary Katherine.

08:50.664 --> 08:54.066
Actually, I go by MK now.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.501
Oh! MK.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.638
I like that.
It's more grown-up.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.307
Oh! Um... Hmm.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.008
Do you have to get that?

09:02.009 --> 09:05.344
Oh, no. No. That was just
one of my sensors.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.812
I got a lot going on right now.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.614
Today is actually
a highly unusual day.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.417
There is both a full moon tonight
and the summer solstice...

09:11.418 --> 09:13.886
which only coincide
every hundred years or so.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.222
You can imagine, it's
just crazy over here.

09:17.223 --> 09:17.924
Hey! Uh...

09:17.925 --> 09:20.226
You probably want
some time to settle in.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.829
I'm just going to let you make
yourself at home, Mary Kather...

09:23.830 --> 09:28.233
Oh! No, who's Mary Katherine?
MK, I mean.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.245
Okay, Mom, I'm trying.

09:40.646 --> 09:42.781
That was the deal.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.797
Oh, my.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.234
Oh!

10:37.470 --> 10:40.772
Come on, Mom, you're
going to miss them.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.745
Hey, Leafmen!

10:47.246 --> 10:49.047
Huh? What?

11:19.011 --> 11:22.381
Queen Tara, we need to
discuss today's ceremony.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.417
The Boggans have
crossed our border again.

11:24.418 --> 11:27.852
You're not getting
enough sunshine.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.056
Yes, it's Ronin.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.058
Well, I think he looks
silly kneeling, too,

11:32.059 --> 11:33.893
but I can't get him
to stop doing it.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.861
I think the Boggans
are scouting our defenses.

11:35.862 --> 11:39.198
You know they'd do anything to
stop you from choosing an heir.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.100
But don't worry,
I've got a plan.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.602
When we were kids
he wasn't so serious.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.638
Would you like to hear my plan?

11:45.639 --> 11:47.807
And he had the sweetest smile.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.375
Look, instead of
a public ceremony,

11:49.376 --> 11:50.743
I go in with a small platoon...

11:50.744 --> 11:52.378
pretend we're
stopping for a drink.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.479
We grab a pod,
bring it back to you.

11:53.480 --> 11:58.084
It blooms, the life of the forest continues.
We're in, we're out.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.119
It doesn't work that way.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.788
I can't choose
unless I'm there.

12:02.789 --> 12:05.057
It's about the feeling.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.159
I get it from the pods...

12:07.160 --> 12:09.395
I get it from the forest...

12:09.396 --> 12:11.863
I get it from all of us.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.567
There we are.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.236
Don't you have feelings, Ronin?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.605
Yes, I feel this is a bad idea.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.608
The Boggans have never
been this aggressive.

12:22.609 --> 12:25.544
I'm not completely
helpless, you know.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.313
I am aware.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.181
But you're
the life of the forest.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.951
Looking after you is my duty.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.754
Is that the only
reason you do it?

12:34.755 --> 12:36.222
Isn't that reason enough?

12:36.223 --> 12:39.225
If that's the only
reason there is.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.626
Your Majesty.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.694
Yes?

12:41.695 --> 12:45.765
I'm not ticklish.
Oh!

12:45.766 --> 12:48.033
You used to be!

12:48.034 --> 12:50.836
Very well. I understand
your concern...

12:50.837 --> 12:55.007
but this is the one day in a hundred
years I can choose an heir.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.542
If I don't do this today...

12:56.543 --> 13:00.278
there won't be
a future to protect.

13:26.006 --> 13:30.276
I don't think I saw
a salute, Boggan!

13:43.756 --> 13:47.393
We had a little skirmish with
some Leafmen this morning.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.895
A rat got caught
in the crossfire...

13:49.896 --> 13:52.398
so I got a new coat.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.935
It's, uh, just like yours!

13:55.936 --> 14:00.773
Did you find the location
of their ceremony?

14:00.774 --> 14:01.807
Uh...

14:01.808 --> 14:02.908
Yes, sir!

14:02.909 --> 14:05.511
It's way outside
of our borders.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.580
You mean their borders?

14:07.581 --> 14:10.649
The Leafmen think they can
keep us contained...

14:10.650 --> 14:13.986
surround our
beautiful island of rot...

14:13.987 --> 14:17.089
with their
hideous green forest.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.157
So arrogant!

14:18.158 --> 14:22.862
All in the name of balance.
I'm sick of balance.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.698
No matter how much of the
forest we destroy...

14:25.699 --> 14:29.635
the queen regrows it
with one wave of her hand.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.539
She needs to be cut down!
At the root!

14:33.540 --> 14:36.641
Exactly.

14:36.976 --> 14:42.347
Today we'll show them
you just can't stop the rot.

14:43.315 --> 14:46.485
If the queen dies
without an heir...

14:46.486 --> 14:49.588
the Leafmen can't
regrow anything.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.825
The balance swings
in our favor forever.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.693
Leaving you and me...

14:54.694 --> 14:59.632
rulers of a desperate,
desiccated kingdom.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.766
I won't let you down...

15:03.068 --> 15:04.036
Dad.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.970
I know you won't.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.774
You look good in rat.

15:08.775 --> 15:12.543
It's slimming.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.549
Yeah!

15:19.185 --> 15:20.552
Look out, look out!

15:20.553 --> 15:22.955
Here comes your star pupil.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.389
Oh, oh, oh!

15:28.427 --> 15:29.862
Where have you been?

15:29.863 --> 15:30.930
Wait, you're mad?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.332
You told me to
get back and I'm back.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.600
On this!

15:34.601 --> 15:36.969
And you want credit for that?
You're late.

15:36.970 --> 15:40.004
Find a real bird and
get back to your group.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.408
You know what? No.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.842
What did you say?

15:43.843 --> 15:44.376
I'm not doing it.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.879
I'm not a kid anymore and I'm tired
of you treating me like one.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.082
I'm trying to help you, I'm
trying to look out for you.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.384
I never asked you to do that.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.985
Your father did.

15:54.987 --> 15:55.487
Well, you can stop.

15:55.488 --> 15:59.058
I absolve you of all further responsibility
in the raising of young Nod.

15:59.059 --> 16:03.195
Don't walk away from me.
I'm your commanding officer!

16:03.196 --> 16:05.163
Not anymore!

16:05.164 --> 16:07.099
I quit! Hyah!

16:07.100 --> 16:10.568
Whoa! Thatta girl.
Easy, easy!

16:12.204 --> 16:13.205
What are you looking at?

16:13.206 --> 16:15.674
Nothing. I have
no opinion on this.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.476
Everyone, mount up!

16:37.896 --> 16:42.767
Parade! Fun! Smiling!

16:51.243 --> 16:52.944
Dad!

16:52.945 --> 16:54.445
Dad!

16:54.446 --> 16:57.549
Is this a good time to talk?

16:57.550 --> 17:01.687
Ow. Hold on, I'll be right down!
Ow!

17:05.290 --> 17:06.492
Ozzy!

17:06.492 --> 17:07.792
Ozzy, stop!

17:07.794 --> 17:09.595
Fetch the camera!

17:11.931 --> 17:13.932
Why do you have
security cameras, anyway?

17:13.933 --> 17:17.269
Do people around here
steal old newspapers?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.305
Oh, no, no. They're not
security cameras.

17:20.306 --> 17:23.474
No, I have an extensive network
all through the forest, yeah.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.178
I don't know how much
your mother told you about my work.

17:28.012 --> 17:29.948
Um... nothing.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.784
Just that you have
a delusional belief...

17:31.785 --> 17:36.688
in an advanced society of tiny
people living in the woods...

17:36.689 --> 17:38.891
and it ruined your career...

17:38.892 --> 17:41.960
not to mention your marriage.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.629
Or something?

17:44.897 --> 17:45.731
Well...

17:45.732 --> 17:48.200
your mother had a
wonderful sense of humor.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.235
But I'm not delusional.
I know they're out there.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.805
It's intuition, like
scientists intuited the atom.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.007
These little guys are a big
part of the ecosystem...

17:55.008 --> 17:58.677
the engine, if you will,
and I will prove it. Here.

17:59.913 --> 18:03.048
You have bat sounds
on your iPod? Why?

18:03.049 --> 18:07.352
To study them. They don't
really fly in your hair.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.454
That's a myth.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.655
But I was trying to identify...

18:09.656 --> 18:14.159
the frequencies that draw bats
to gather with their own kind.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.861
So I slowed the sounds down...

18:15.862 --> 18:18.997
and I put them through
some proprietary filters...

18:18.998 --> 18:20.698
and guess what I heard.

18:20.966 --> 18:22.701
Voices?

18:22.702 --> 18:23.935
Yes!

18:37.516 --> 18:39.852
Isn't that cool?
Okay...

18:39.853 --> 18:43.388
if tiny men are flying
around in the forest...

18:43.389 --> 18:44.790
how come I've never seen them?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.692
No, that's easy.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.093
It's the same reason
we can't hear them.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.629
They just move too fast, like insects.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.866
Didn't you ever wonder why it
was so hard to swat a fly?

18:53.867 --> 18:57.169
My theory is they're
actually living faster.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.238
Like in a different dimension.

19:00.239 --> 19:02.307
So, no matter how fast
we think we are...

19:02.308 --> 19:04.576
to them we're just
big and dumb and...

19:04.577 --> 19:07.212
slow.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.048
Have you ever seen one?

19:10.049 --> 19:10.949
Well, you know, uh...

19:10.950 --> 19:13.752
You know what? Just because
you haven't seen something...

19:13.753 --> 19:15.187
doesn't mean it's not there.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.689
I, you know, that's...

19:17.690 --> 19:19.023
Come on.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.827
Okay, we need to talk.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.829
I know it's a lot to take in.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.631
I mean about us.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.666
Oh, no! No,
we'll do it together!

19:27.667 --> 19:31.802
Yeah, both of us. Here,
I made this for you.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.439
Dad, look...

19:34.440 --> 19:36.508
I am almost old enough
to be on my own anyway...

19:36.509 --> 19:40.912
so I think it would
be better if I just...

19:40.913 --> 19:41.213
Um...

19:41.214 --> 19:44.349
You don't want to live here?
That's what you want?

19:44.350 --> 19:46.351
No, it's not what I want.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.820
I want you to stop!
All this!

19:48.821 --> 19:53.491
And be normal. I just, I want
a dad who's not...

19:55.495 --> 19:57.596
Oh, um, okay.
This is big.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.699
This is a big thing going on right now.
Let me just find...

20:00.700 --> 20:01.433
Where are you going?

20:01.434 --> 20:02.968
I'm just going to
investigate, rather...

20:02.969 --> 20:06.038
Okay, something must be happening.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.774
Ooh! Uh... Let's see.
Where's my camera?

20:08.775 --> 20:09.341
Are you serious?

20:09.342 --> 20:11.510
You have to catch these
things in the moment...

20:11.511 --> 20:12.211
while they're happening...

20:12.212 --> 20:14.780
otherwise you miss a chance
that could be gone forever.

20:14.781 --> 20:18.217
You're missing a chance right now!
Are you even listening?

20:18.218 --> 20:20.285
Look, you've got to believe me.
I am so close.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.854
All I need is one little breakthrough.
This could be it!

20:22.855 --> 20:26.525
I will clear this
all up when I get back!

20:26.526 --> 20:28.393
I promise!

20:28.394 --> 20:30.195
Sure, Dad.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.596
I'll be here.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.665
In reality.

20:43.609 --> 20:44.910
Bye, Ozzy.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.078
It's not you.

20:47.613 --> 20:50.749
Uh, Larry? I need
that getaway cab.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.286
I said, pick me up
by the... Hello?

20:54.287 --> 20:56.955
Ugh! No bars!

20:56.956 --> 20:58.523
Ozzy! Heel!

20:58.524 --> 21:00.826
Stop! Play dead!

21:00.827 --> 21:03.961
How are you so fast
on three legs?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.997
Ozzy!

21:06.565 --> 21:08.099
Ozzy!

21:08.767 --> 21:10.334
Ozzy!

22:05.424 --> 22:06.925
Isn't she pretty?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.427
She's awesome!

22:08.428 --> 22:11.897
She moved those trees
with her mind!

22:11.898 --> 22:14.666
Mom, can I be queen
when I grow up?

22:14.667 --> 22:18.236
Oh, honey, it doesn't
work that way.

22:18.237 --> 22:22.974
Today, Queen Tara gives her
power to a special Pod...

22:22.975 --> 22:26.211
so the life of
the forest will continue.

22:26.212 --> 22:29.281
It's all
very mysterious, and...

22:29.282 --> 22:32.851
Sweetie, what are you doing?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.020
Mom!
I did it!

22:35.021 --> 22:36.855
Did what?

22:36.856 --> 22:38.089
Aw!

22:40.192 --> 22:40.826
She's coming!

22:40.827 --> 22:42.094
Don't do anything
to embarrass me...

22:42.095 --> 22:44.296
or it could ruin my chances
of being a Leafman.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.931
Why do you want
to be a Leafman?

22:45.932 --> 22:47.199
They gotta wear uniforms.

22:47.200 --> 22:51.403
Me? I like to let
it all hang free.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.505
You see this, you see that?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.774
Yeah, don't do that.
That's vile.

22:55.775 --> 22:59.277
Come on, I know you
got a little belly, too.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.147
Gentlemen.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.950
Hey. Your Majesty.
Hello.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.719
It's all right.
Relax, it's just me.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.390
Mub, Grub, it's a very
nice-looking group of Pods.

23:11.391 --> 23:15.260
I might have a hard time picking one.
Do you have a favorite?

23:15.261 --> 23:18.563
Well, Your Majesty, we
have had quite the debate.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.898
Really gone back and forth.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.299
You'll note
the carefully curated

23:21.300 --> 23:23.535
selection of sizes,
densities, color.

23:23.536 --> 23:26.505
With so many variables,
you can't be too hasty.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.340
Boom! Right here.

23:28.341 --> 23:30.941
Biggest in the bunch.

23:30.942 --> 23:31.576
Hmm.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.479
Well, that's one way to go.

23:34.480 --> 23:37.548
How about that one?

23:38.850 --> 23:40.585
What? That one?

23:40.586 --> 23:42.187
For real?
But it's so...

23:42.188 --> 23:43.889
Perfect!
It's perfect.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.258
Excellent choice, Your Majesty.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.927
Sometimes the biggest one
isn't the best one. Ow!

23:48.928 --> 23:55.232
I told you, she doesn't like gaudy, Mub.
Unlike you, she's got class.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.638
This is it.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.372
This is the one.

24:01.706 --> 24:03.107
Aw!

24:21.460 --> 24:22.927
Boggans.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.449
Your Majesty!
Get to the barge!

25:06.004 --> 25:08.439
I told you she was awesome!

25:09.608 --> 25:11.542
Hold the formation!

25:13.044 --> 25:16.515
This is it, Mub!
My chance to be a Leaf...

25:17.917 --> 25:20.985
What? Your chance
to be a what?

25:34.933 --> 25:36.166
Ronin!

26:28.753 --> 26:30.454
Ozzy?

26:30.855 --> 26:33.090
Oh, come on, Ozzy.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.834
We had numbers, and we
had the surprise part!

26:42.835 --> 26:43.335
How are we losing?

26:43.336 --> 26:47.405
Patience, son. The forest
wasn't grown in a day.

26:47.406 --> 26:51.276
But we can destroy it
in one. Right?

26:51.277 --> 26:53.178
Ha! That's the spirit!

26:53.179 --> 26:56.614
You take the Pod,
I'll take the queen.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.531
Nice one!

27:13.532 --> 27:15.500
You're stealing my moves, kid!

27:15.501 --> 27:17.168
Your Majesty, come with me!

27:17.169 --> 27:17.902
Take her to safety!

27:17.903 --> 27:20.372
I have to lead them
away from the crowd!

27:20.373 --> 27:22.373
You're totally my hero!

27:42.394 --> 27:43.361
Okay...

27:43.362 --> 27:45.130
so maybe you were right.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.431
Remind me to gloat later.

28:02.313 --> 28:06.183
Son! No!

28:18.531 --> 28:20.699
Ozzy!

29:08.313 --> 29:09.480
Ah!

29:11.683 --> 29:13.717
Oh!

29:19.691 --> 29:22.559
Ah! Ah, ah!

29:23.962 --> 29:25.829
Ahhh!

29:32.670 --> 29:33.937
Huh?

29:37.977 --> 29:39.310
Are you okay?

29:39.311 --> 29:41.311
Are you all right?

29:41.312 --> 29:43.381
Oh, my gosh, that's an arrow.

29:43.382 --> 29:47.552
Should I pull it out?
I don't know what to do.

29:47.553 --> 29:50.855
Take the Pod to Nim Galuu.

29:50.856 --> 29:53.925
Nim what?
You need a doctor.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.293
Somebody call...

29:55.294 --> 29:57.895
What is this thing?

29:58.163 --> 30:01.298
It's the life of the forest.

30:12.877 --> 30:14.178
Tara!

30:26.558 --> 30:28.926
So serious.

31:32.123 --> 31:34.057
I'm so sorry.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.594
What did she say to you?

31:36.595 --> 31:41.199
Something about glue?
Or a canoe.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.367
Nim Galuu.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.502
The scroll keeper.

31:44.503 --> 31:48.239
We don't know anything about
the Pod without Tara.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.908
Maybe he does.

31:49.909 --> 31:51.576
Take the Leafmen to Moonhaven.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.979
Fortify it.
Keep everyone safe.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.413
What about you?

31:57.215 --> 31:58.983
Mandrake will be
looking for this Pod...

31:58.984 --> 32:02.086
but he won't be looking for
a Leafman traveling alone.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.288
That's not what I meant.

32:05.390 --> 32:07.659
I know what you meant.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.460
I'll send word
when I reach Nim's.

32:09.461 --> 32:14.832
Who are you people? Is this
some sort of reenactment?

32:16.501 --> 32:17.835
That's a big bug.

32:17.836 --> 32:20.704
No, it's about
average, actually.

32:22.007 --> 32:25.509
Then what? I'm tiny?

32:28.880 --> 32:30.147
Oh, no.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.316
No.

32:36.421 --> 32:37.588
No, no, no.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.458
I'm not sure why the queen
brought you here either...

32:40.459 --> 32:43.494
but she gave you that Pod,
so you have to come with me.

32:43.495 --> 32:44.629
Make me big!
Excuse me?

32:44.630 --> 32:47.332
I'm not going anywhere until
you make me big again!

32:47.333 --> 32:49.300
Uh... You know what?
I don't do magic.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.370
You can talk to Nim Galuu about
that, he might know something.

32:52.371 --> 32:52.804
Might?

32:52.805 --> 32:56.174
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not so fast, soldier boy.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.643
You do not yank on a Pod, okay?

32:58.644 --> 33:03.614
Especially when it's attached
to something so lovely.

33:03.615 --> 33:04.949
Talking snails.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.818
Actually, he's a snail.

33:06.819 --> 33:10.021
I'm a slug.
No shell over here, baby.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.556
It just slows me down.

33:11.557 --> 33:15.059
Ronin, right?
Head of the Leafmen?

33:15.060 --> 33:15.860
Big fan.

33:15.861 --> 33:19.096
I just love what
you do with your jaw.

33:19.630 --> 33:20.832
Yes, that!

33:20.833 --> 33:23.701
We are the official
Pod caretakers, sir.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.270
It can't survive without us.

33:26.271 --> 33:27.772
We keep it moist.

33:27.773 --> 33:31.242
Moist is what we do.

33:31.243 --> 33:33.443
You're kidding.

33:33.778 --> 33:35.947
You're not kidding. Fine.

33:35.948 --> 33:39.784
Word of the queen's
passing will travel fast...

33:39.785 --> 33:40.985
we have to travel faster.

33:40.986 --> 33:44.756
With all this extra weight we're
going to need another bird.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.691
Bird. Of course.

33:51.863 --> 33:52.897
By any chance...

33:52.898 --> 33:55.533
you don't happen to be part
of an advanced society...

33:55.534 --> 33:59.803
of tiny people living
in the woods, do you?

34:02.673 --> 34:06.476
Some are more
advanced than others.

34:12.918 --> 34:15.753
<i>And that's another lap down.
These racers are in it to win...</i>

34:15.754 --> 34:17.288
<i>and they'd better be,
we've got some</i>

34:17.289 --> 34:18.688
<i>heavy betting
in the crowd today.</i>

34:18.690 --> 34:20.491
<i>They're clustering together...</i>

34:20.492 --> 34:23.628
I'm telling you,
this is where I belong!

34:23.629 --> 34:25.696
You belong in
the back of the pack!

34:25.697 --> 34:27.565
I mean racing!
The best man wins.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.168
No other rules, nobody
telling you what to do.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.101
You talk too much!

34:31.103 --> 34:33.036
And you ain't
winning this race!

34:33.038 --> 34:36.273
Sorry, can't hear you!
Going too fast!

34:39.844 --> 34:42.746
Hey. Nice old
fleabag you got there.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.683
It's not the bird,
it's how you ride it.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.185
Yeah? Prove it.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.853
Fetch!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:48.853 --> 34:49.920
<i>That's a dirty trick,</i>

34:49.922 --> 34:52.857
<i>which, let's face it, is exactly
what we've come to see.</i>

34:52.858 --> 34:53.591
Final lap!

34:53.592 --> 34:55.893
<i>This is bird racing,
folks, it's not a parade.</i>

34:55.893 --> 34:58.695
<i>Looks like Nod's out of the race.</i>

35:05.403 --> 35:06.604
<i>Wait a minute, is that...</i>

35:06.605 --> 35:08.139
<i>Nod is down but not out!</i>

35:08.140 --> 35:10.074
<i>Don't let his
old bird fool you!</i>

35:10.075 --> 35:11.776
<i>The kid's on
the comeback trail!</i>

35:11.777 --> 35:14.544
You know what
we'll do if you win?

35:15.046 --> 35:16.481
I don't know, lose?

35:16.482 --> 35:17.648
<i>It's the final lap.</i>

35:17.649 --> 35:19.183
<i>They're beak to beak,
wing to wing...</i>

35:19.184 --> 35:21.786
<i>and it's Nod by a tail feather!</i>

35:21.787 --> 35:23.287
<i>The odds-on favorite takes it home.</i>

35:23.288 --> 35:27.225
<i>I bet there's a lot of happy
faces in the crowd right now.</i>

35:29.227 --> 35:31.095
Is that the best you've got?

35:31.096 --> 35:33.431
How was that?

35:33.432 --> 35:33.998
Better.

35:33.999 --> 35:37.268
Nod, you know I like you.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.103
Yeah, I like you, too,
Mr. Bufo.

35:39.104 --> 35:42.373
And yet, you don't
do what we agreed.

35:42.374 --> 35:46.377
We agreed that you would
lose, but then you win.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.845
Now, I can't help it
if I'm fast.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.581
You want me to lose, you gotta
give me some better competition.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.183
It's called teamwork.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.718
Maybe if you understood that...

35:53.719 --> 35:55.453
the Leafmen wouldn't
have kicked you out.

35:55.454 --> 35:58.556
They did not kick me out.
I quit.

35:58.557 --> 36:03.094
I admire your independent
spirit, Nod, I'll miss that.

36:03.095 --> 36:06.197
Feed him to something.
A snake would be good.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.399
No, snakes just
swallow you whole.

36:08.400 --> 36:12.270
Now, if you put him in a
hornets' nest, that's a show.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.972
Ah, look, it's Ronin,
defender of the weak...

36:14.973 --> 36:18.142
popper of parties,
here to ruin the fun.

36:18.143 --> 36:20.877
I didn't ruin all of it.
I let you hit him.

36:21.245 --> 36:21.746
Twice.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.414
Hop along now, little froggy.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.484
Easy, Ronin, it's a
big forest out there.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.286
Even Leafmen gotta sleep.

36:28.287 --> 36:31.322
You're wasting your time.
I'm not coming back.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.190
I'm not asking.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.692
Oh, I see. The old
reverse psychology.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.061
Make me feel guilty,
get me to beg you.

36:37.062 --> 36:40.498
I didn't come for you.
The queen is dead.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.500
What? How?

36:42.501 --> 36:43.167
Boggan ambush.

36:43.168 --> 36:46.771
Ronin,
I don't know what to say.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.806
She was your...

36:48.807 --> 36:49.574
I'm sorry.

36:49.575 --> 36:52.710
What's going to happen
to us, to the forest?

36:52.711 --> 36:57.080
If we don't get the Pod to Nim
Galuu's, the forest will die.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.516
Let me grab my saddle.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.018
What? No. I
didn't ask for your help.

37:01.019 --> 37:04.355
Really? Because it sounds like
you could use a rider with my...

37:04.356 --> 37:05.823
Ability to absorb punches?

37:05.824 --> 37:08.559
The situation's desperate.
Let's not make it hopeless.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.729
All right, well, who's with you?
Who's riding point?

37:17.101 --> 37:18.401
Uh-oh.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.739
Get your saddle.
I'll get my saddle.

37:25.277 --> 37:28.846
This doesn't make any...
I mean, it makes sense.

37:29.214 --> 37:32.216
Mary Katherine, you're not gonna
believe these readings...

37:32.217 --> 37:33.517
they are off the charts!

37:33.518 --> 37:35.486
The wind, and the
rain and lightning!

37:35.487 --> 37:38.122
And the birds were flying!
In a storm!

37:38.123 --> 37:39.824
Okay, and that's not normal.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.392
Which would prove...

37:41.393 --> 37:44.462
Actually, you know what?
I'm going to make some lunch...

37:44.463 --> 37:46.964
and I'll tell you all about it.

37:49.867 --> 37:52.169
Ozzy, what are you
doing outside?

37:52.170 --> 37:54.971
Did you see it, too?
Tell me you saw it.

37:55.239 --> 37:59.043
Hey, Mary Katheri...
Or, no, MK!

37:59.044 --> 38:02.846
MK, what did you
want to talk about?

38:03.748 --> 38:06.583
What?
What is it, Ozzy?

38:22.900 --> 38:25.369
Hey, I'm Nod, by the way.

38:25.370 --> 38:27.204
Hi. MK. Yeah.

38:27.205 --> 38:30.308
Could you just face the
way the bird's driving?

38:30.309 --> 38:32.410
No, don't worry. She
practically flies herself.

38:32.411 --> 38:35.780
Great, because this whole
bird-riding thing's new to me.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.848
Are you serious?
We gotta fix that.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.784
Here, put your arms around me.

38:39.785 --> 38:40.251
I just met you.

38:40.252 --> 38:43.454
Okay, but you're gonna
want to hold on to something.

38:47.024 --> 38:47.758
What is wrong with you?

38:47.759 --> 38:50.094
Do you know how hard it is
to do that without falling?

38:50.095 --> 38:52.797
I do now!
Nod, perch your bird.

38:52.798 --> 38:55.866
Hey, I'm just trying
to keep things...

38:55.867 --> 38:57.233
light.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.837
What did that?

38:59.838 --> 39:01.105
Mandrake.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.574
Tara's power always
kept him in check.

39:03.575 --> 39:07.345
Now nothing can heal
what he destroys.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.212
Except that Pod.

39:11.515 --> 39:13.084
We have to go around.

39:13.085 --> 39:14.518
Just for one scout?

39:14.519 --> 39:16.953
Ever see just one Boggan?

39:18.856 --> 39:21.392
Hold on to me. Hyah!
Still barely know you.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.393
Nod, wait!

39:24.830 --> 39:25.930
Whoa!

39:25.931 --> 39:28.365
Get to the ground!

39:37.541 --> 39:38.476
This way!

39:42.546 --> 39:44.648
Other way!

39:50.921 --> 39:52.189
What was that thing?

39:52.190 --> 39:54.258
What, you've never
seen a Boggan?

39:54.259 --> 39:56.560
Someone had a happy childhood.

39:56.561 --> 39:59.263
Come on, let's regroup.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.766
You mean up there
with those things?

40:01.767 --> 40:03.733
They almost killed us.

40:04.402 --> 40:06.704
Don't turn around.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.939
Is it a Boogie?

40:08.940 --> 40:11.808
Walk towards me slowly.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.521
Oh, it's a mouse.

40:23.522 --> 40:27.992
Hi, mousie!
I was gonna scare it away.

40:27.993 --> 40:28.659
What are you doing?

40:28.660 --> 40:33.130
Look at its little hands and
its little whiskers. Oh!

40:44.809 --> 40:46.310
Hello! Other person!

40:46.311 --> 40:48.845
Jump!
I can't jump that high!

40:52.450 --> 40:54.752
Ohh! Ah!

40:54.753 --> 40:57.087
Did you see what I just did?

40:57.088 --> 40:59.289
Out! Jump out!

41:06.798 --> 41:08.731
Oh, great.

41:09.767 --> 41:13.002
Hey, over here!
Over here!

41:18.843 --> 41:20.477
Whoa, whoa!

41:23.080 --> 41:25.415
Fuzzy mousie.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.550
Ahh!

41:27.952 --> 41:31.387
Nice tail.
It's flexible.

41:33.024 --> 41:36.726
Ah! Ah! Help!

41:42.333 --> 41:45.536
They have very
sensitive whiskers.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.937
You know, I had this.

41:47.938 --> 41:48.939
Uh-huh.

41:48.940 --> 41:49.940
Are you all right?

41:49.941 --> 41:52.710
Dad? I had the most
messed-up dream.

41:52.711 --> 41:59.215
There were talking slugs and tiny
little soldiers and...

41:59.917 --> 42:01.285
Hello!

42:01.286 --> 42:03.286
Ah, man!

42:03.687 --> 42:04.688
Now let's move.

42:04.689 --> 42:09.192
Where there's mice there's
bound to be chipmunks.

42:10.327 --> 42:12.329
New seating arrangement.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.902
You're riding with me.

42:17.903 --> 42:19.103
Thank you.

42:19.104 --> 42:20.604
You're with the slugs.

42:20.605 --> 42:21.972
Ugh! Disgusting.

42:21.973 --> 42:25.442
Do you and me have a problem?

42:25.443 --> 42:27.811
Uh, I don't think so.

42:27.812 --> 42:29.046
What was that over there?

42:29.047 --> 42:31.749
A little chit-chat?
That's real cute.

42:31.750 --> 42:32.983
You trying to jump in?

42:32.984 --> 42:34.418
What are we talking about?

42:34.419 --> 42:37.321
There's a code amongst men.

42:37.322 --> 42:39.823
It goes something like this.

42:39.824 --> 42:42.725
I saw her first.

42:43.327 --> 42:46.030
Ow!

42:46.031 --> 42:46.997
You're a slug.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.466
So? You think
she'd want you?

42:49.467 --> 42:51.101
Look at yourself!

42:51.102 --> 42:53.337
Oh, that's right, you can't...

42:53.338 --> 42:57.541
because your eyeballs are stuck
all the way inside your head.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.811
What's wrong, flatface?
Are you gonna cry?

43:00.812 --> 43:04.348
Do you want me to call
your flatface mommy?

43:04.349 --> 43:09.620
You know you're not insulting me, right?
You're just grossing me out.

43:09.621 --> 43:11.888
You've been warned.

43:12.656 --> 43:14.123
Ow!

43:36.013 --> 43:37.748
Hey, if this is a bad time...

43:37.749 --> 43:41.951
I can come back when
you're done gardening.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.721
Oh! Hey!

43:43.722 --> 43:48.258
I imagine you're wondering
why I invited you here.

43:48.259 --> 43:52.329
I was frog-marched
here at spearpoint. Ah!

43:52.330 --> 43:54.031
How is that invited?

43:54.032 --> 43:55.766
I let you keep your legs.

43:55.767 --> 43:58.502
Comedy. Terrific.

43:58.503 --> 43:59.770
Funny psychopath.

43:59.771 --> 44:01.672
There are rumors
that the Leafman Ronin

44:01.673 --> 44:03.440
was at your
place of business...

44:03.441 --> 44:07.878
and that he may have
rescued a Royal Pod.

44:07.879 --> 44:09.346
Real smooth.

44:09.347 --> 44:13.150
You got rid of the queen,
but let her Pod get away.

44:13.151 --> 44:16.453
Plus your idiot general
gets himself mulched.

44:16.454 --> 44:19.023
That idiot general...

44:19.024 --> 44:21.557
was my son!

44:38.877 --> 44:41.378
Of course he was.
He had your good looks.

44:41.379 --> 44:44.581
And your healthy
gray complexion.

44:44.582 --> 44:46.417
And forgiving nature.

44:46.418 --> 44:47.618
Shut up!

44:47.619 --> 44:49.987
What's it gonna be, Bufo?

44:49.988 --> 44:51.321
Are you gonna talk?

44:51.322 --> 44:54.391
Or are you gonna croak?

44:54.392 --> 44:57.927
Where are they taking the Pod?

45:11.208 --> 45:13.209
It's clear. Hyah!

45:20.284 --> 45:22.953
Why is he even with us?
He's not helping.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.089
Well, when he's
not being an idiot...

45:25.090 --> 45:26.623
he's a pretty decent flier.

45:26.624 --> 45:28.625
Could be one of the best.

45:28.626 --> 45:33.163
Plus his father was my
friend, so I do what I can.

45:33.164 --> 45:35.332
"Many leaves, one tree."

45:35.333 --> 45:36.734
What does that mean?

45:36.735 --> 45:40.971
We're all individuals,
but we're still connected.

45:40.972 --> 45:43.140
It's what we live by.

45:43.141 --> 45:44.674
Hyah!

45:44.675 --> 45:48.245
Maybe you're connected,
but I'm kind of on my own.

45:48.246 --> 45:49.712
No one's on their own.

45:51.682 --> 45:53.416
Not even him.

45:55.352 --> 45:57.755
Hey, Nod, how's the view?

46:21.211 --> 46:22.312
Well...

46:22.313 --> 46:22.780
here we are.

46:22.781 --> 46:25.682
I thought this was a
secret Leafmen mission.

46:25.683 --> 46:28.051
How many people did the
queen tell about this?

46:28.052 --> 46:29.453
They're here
looking for answers.

46:29.454 --> 46:31.355
Nobody knows that
the queen is gone...

46:31.356 --> 46:33.490
only that the blight
is spreading.

46:33.491 --> 46:35.259
So, this Nim guy can tell them?

46:35.260 --> 46:36.360
He's the keeper
of our history...

46:36.361 --> 46:38.796
but even he may not
know about the queen.

46:38.797 --> 46:40.631
He's not always up to speed.

46:40.632 --> 46:41.832
But he'll help, right?

46:41.833 --> 46:43.734
He's, like, the wise
old man of the forest.

46:43.735 --> 46:47.103
Uh, he's more like the crazy uncle.

46:48.105 --> 46:49.573
The whole meadow just died.

46:49.574 --> 46:52.776
Everything was green,
and now it's gone.

46:52.777 --> 46:54.211
I grew up in that meadow.

46:54.212 --> 46:55.546
Why isn't
the queen doing anything?

46:55.547 --> 46:58.749
If anything happened
to her, everything's going to rot!

46:58.750 --> 47:01.118
We're doomed!
We're doomed!

47:01.119 --> 47:02.920
Get a hold of yourself!

47:02.921 --> 47:04.654
Oops. Sorry.

47:05.055 --> 47:06.223
Friends!

47:06.224 --> 47:08.992
Neighbors!

47:11.562 --> 47:14.497
Prepare to see your worries...

47:14.898 --> 47:16.333
disappear.

47:16.334 --> 47:17.868
Ooh!

47:17.869 --> 47:20.337
I know rumors
have been flying...

47:20.972 --> 47:24.374
but the truth is never
as bad as it seems.

47:24.375 --> 47:28.912
I have just returned from
deep inside this tree...

47:28.913 --> 47:32.348
from the Rings of Knowledge...

47:33.584 --> 47:34.651
where every memory...

47:34.652 --> 47:37.454
every event that ever
happens in the forest...

47:37.455 --> 47:41.258
is recorded in these scrolls.

47:41.259 --> 47:44.595
<i>♪ Listen, party poopers,
I've got something to say</i>

47:44.596 --> 47:47.097
<i>♪ Dry your weeping eyes,
we're gonna be okay</i>

47:47.098 --> 47:50.500
<i>♪ So you don't have to worry
about a dog gone thing</i>

47:50.501 --> 47:53.070
<i>♪ The Rings of Knowledge
know everything</i>

47:53.071 --> 47:56.240
<i>♪ The scrolls never lie and,
honey, neither does Nim</i>

47:56.241 --> 47:59.142
<i>♪ It's right here in my hands,
all six of them</i>

47:59.143 --> 48:02.346
<i>♪ So tuck your little fears
and put them right into bed</i>

48:02.347 --> 48:04.581
<i>♪ It says right here
that the queen...</i>

48:04.582 --> 48:07.150
That the queen is...

48:07.151 --> 48:08.619
Uh...
What?

48:09.454 --> 48:10.988
Just tell us what it says!

48:10.989 --> 48:11.955
What's it say?

48:11.956 --> 48:16.392
He doesn't know
anything! Boo!

48:16.393 --> 48:17.027
Fraud!

48:17.028 --> 48:20.130
<i>♪ Dry your weeping
eyes, we're gonna be fine</i>

48:20.131 --> 48:22.366
<i>♪ Everything is
really gonna be all right ♪</i>

48:22.367 --> 48:24.902
Ronin! Did you
hear about the queen?

48:24.903 --> 48:26.270
This is terrible!

48:26.271 --> 48:27.337
I know, but...

48:27.338 --> 48:27.905
We gotta do something!

48:27.906 --> 48:31.074
We gotta keep everyone from freaking out!
Yes, that's why we...

48:31.075 --> 48:32.442
And the Pod!
We gotta make sure

48:32.443 --> 48:34.478
the Royal Pod is
safely hidden...

48:34.479 --> 48:36.546
far away. And...

48:36.547 --> 48:37.781
What'd you bring it here for?

48:37.782 --> 48:41.051
The queen's last words were
"Bring the Pod to Nim Galuu."

48:41.052 --> 48:44.688
She say anything else? Specific
instructions? Maybe a note?

48:44.689 --> 48:48.825
Those were her last words.
I thought you were magic.

48:48.826 --> 48:50.494
Magic might be stretching it.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.896
I'm charismatic.
Possibly charming.

48:52.897 --> 48:55.532
Do you know what to do
with the Pod or not?

48:55.533 --> 48:59.169
Not a clue, but I do know
where to look it up.

48:59.170 --> 48:59.670
Follow me!

48:59.671 --> 49:02.205
There he is!
Phony!

49:02.206 --> 49:05.241
Um, no, it's this way.

49:08.645 --> 49:11.348
The Rings of Knowledge!

49:11.349 --> 49:15.886
Is everything that happens
really recorded right here?

49:15.887 --> 49:16.620
Oh, yeah.

49:16.621 --> 49:18.555
And you've read
all these scrolls?

49:18.556 --> 49:19.656
Ah, I've skimmed them.

49:19.657 --> 49:23.760
So, is this event being recorded?
Right now?

49:23.761 --> 49:24.795
Of course.

49:24.796 --> 49:28.031
Is this?
Yes.

49:28.032 --> 49:29.799
How about this?

49:34.805 --> 49:35.672
Yes.

49:35.673 --> 49:37.907
What about this?

49:45.449 --> 49:46.216
Yep.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.418
That should be it right here.

49:48.419 --> 49:49.986
Thanks, Marty.

49:52.122 --> 49:53.590
Aw!

49:53.591 --> 49:55.926
Okay. Blooming a Pod.

49:55.927 --> 49:58.861
Gotta go way back for that.

49:58.862 --> 50:00.998
Here we go.

50:00.999 --> 50:01.798
Let's see.

50:01.799 --> 50:06.435
Pod, care of.
Must keep moist.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.008
Well, good news is,
once the queen chooses it...

50:11.009 --> 50:13.110
it's going to
bloom no matter what.

50:13.111 --> 50:14.544
But it has to open tonight...

50:14.545 --> 50:19.616
in the light of the full moon
when it's at its highest peak.

50:19.617 --> 50:20.450
Yep, solstice...

50:20.451 --> 50:23.954
full moon, highest peak,
mentions it a bunch of times.

50:23.955 --> 50:27.357
What happens if it blooms
out of the moonlight?

50:27.358 --> 50:30.293
Unclear.
The last part's missing.

50:30.294 --> 50:33.997
I gotta be honest, termites
have been a problem.

50:33.998 --> 50:36.533
So here I thought
we were doomed.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.635
This calls for a celebration!

50:38.636 --> 50:41.804
I suppose we've earned it.

50:43.940 --> 50:44.674
Wait...

50:44.675 --> 50:47.044
this is gonna
sound weird, but...

50:47.045 --> 50:49.079
I'm not from this world.

50:49.080 --> 50:51.948
And I thought maybe something in
these scrolls could tell me...

50:51.949 --> 50:54.117
if there's a way
for me to get home.

50:54.118 --> 50:56.186
The scrolls don't
tell the future...

50:56.187 --> 50:59.756
they only guide us with the
knowledge of the past.

50:59.757 --> 51:01.758
Hey, that's a great line!

51:01.759 --> 51:03.894
You guys got that, right?

51:03.895 --> 51:05.429
So you can't help me?

51:05.430 --> 51:07.596
I didn't say that.

51:10.734 --> 51:11.802
I can't read this.

51:11.803 --> 51:15.071
It's just dusty.
Blow it off.

51:22.914 --> 51:24.247
It's you.

51:24.248 --> 51:28.185
But I saw you turn into moss.

51:28.186 --> 51:28.952
Come closer.

51:28.953 --> 51:32.855
Oh, this is perfect!
You can make me big again.

51:32.856 --> 51:34.390
Closer.

51:40.363 --> 51:41.465
It's a memory.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.633
If you can hear me now...

51:43.634 --> 51:46.936
it means you got to Nim's.

51:46.937 --> 51:48.405
The Pod needs you.

51:48.406 --> 51:52.441
I can't be
around for it anymore.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.281
No, don't do that!

51:58.282 --> 51:59.249
Why would you give that to me?

51:59.250 --> 52:01.718
You don't understand,
I have to get home...

52:01.719 --> 52:03.553
this has nothing to do with me.

52:03.554 --> 52:05.522
You're here for a reason.

52:05.523 --> 52:08.125
Maybe you don't see
the connections yet.

52:08.126 --> 52:10.227
But just because
you don't see them

52:10.228 --> 52:12.429
doesn't mean they're not there.

52:12.430 --> 52:15.866
I know you're scared.
Just stay with the Pod...

52:15.867 --> 52:17.367
be with it when it blooms...

52:17.368 --> 52:21.872
and then you'll get
back what you've given.

52:21.873 --> 52:24.173
You'll get back.

52:26.978 --> 52:28.845
Well, that was intense.

52:28.846 --> 52:30.480
I gotta read more of these.

52:30.481 --> 52:32.649
That means I can get home!

52:32.650 --> 52:37.987
Well, if you want to go home so
bad, then why did you leave?

52:41.893 --> 52:44.294
Lose the sword, Ronin,
we're done.

52:44.295 --> 52:46.396
We're not done
until the Pod blooms.

52:46.397 --> 52:48.298
We're bringing it
home to Moonhaven.

52:48.299 --> 52:50.100
I need you to
watch it while I tell

52:50.101 --> 52:51.434
the rest of the Leafmen
to expect us.

52:51.435 --> 52:54.271
Hey, I helped you get here,
but I haven't changed my mind.

52:54.272 --> 52:56.406
Do you think just because
you're not a Leafman anymore...

52:56.407 --> 52:57.707
you're not a part of this?

52:57.708 --> 53:01.311
Well, the fate of that Pod
affects all of us.

53:01.312 --> 53:03.680
The queen is gone.

53:03.681 --> 53:07.117
But, as always,
she looked out for us...

53:07.118 --> 53:08.952
even in her final moments.

53:08.953 --> 53:14.224
Tonight, when this Pod blooms,
a new queen will rise!

53:14.225 --> 53:16.193
I know you're sad.

53:16.194 --> 53:17.527
I am, too.

53:17.528 --> 53:20.096
But Tara wouldn't
want us to mourn!

53:20.097 --> 53:23.033
She'd want us to
celebrate her life!

53:23.034 --> 53:25.802
And the life of the forest!

53:27.038 --> 53:28.271
So, stay with it.

53:28.272 --> 53:31.241
And don't lose the sword.

53:44.421 --> 53:47.657
Look, I'm thinking that I didn't
make the best first impression.

53:47.658 --> 53:52.062
It's okay. I've never had a guy
fight a mouse for me before.

53:52.063 --> 53:55.265
You're not from
around here, are you?

53:55.266 --> 53:56.499
What makes you say that?

53:56.500 --> 53:57.968
If you were,
I would remember you.

53:57.969 --> 53:59.669
To Queen Tara!
To the queen!

53:59.670 --> 54:02.205
You wanna go somewhere quieter?

54:02.206 --> 54:04.040
Will that be okay with Ronin?

54:04.041 --> 54:05.375
Yeah, he said to
watch the Pod...

54:05.376 --> 54:07.544
but there's nowhere
safer than Nim's tree.

54:07.545 --> 54:10.013
I think he's just pretty
upset about the queen.

54:10.014 --> 54:12.449
Here, let me show you something.

54:12.450 --> 54:13.583
What?

54:15.485 --> 54:16.853
Huh.

54:16.854 --> 54:19.488
That actually gets easier.

54:19.489 --> 54:21.992
What is...

54:27.864 --> 54:29.598
Wow.

54:48.718 --> 54:50.387
Grab on!
What?

54:50.388 --> 54:52.254
Put your arms around me.

54:52.255 --> 54:53.890
But I barely know you.

54:53.891 --> 54:56.225
Do you want to ride him or not?

55:15.478 --> 55:17.314
The scroll said
there was nothing

55:17.315 --> 55:19.482
you could do to
save her, Ronin.

55:19.483 --> 55:22.151
You have to know that.

55:24.354 --> 55:25.955
Send a code to the Leafmen.

55:25.956 --> 55:29.125
Let them know the Pod is safe
and we're bringing it home.

55:29.126 --> 55:31.728
You heard him.
Go tell them, boys!

55:31.729 --> 55:34.698
And it's happy hour at Nim's!

55:34.699 --> 55:37.499
Or just do the first part.

55:58.955 --> 56:04.561
I gotta admit, flying is nice,
but this is riding in style.

56:04.562 --> 56:07.597
Yeah.
Not everyone can do it.

56:07.598 --> 56:11.801
You have to be gentle to ride a deer.
My dad taught me how.

56:11.802 --> 56:14.903
It's one of my
best memories of him.

56:14.904 --> 56:17.573
You must really miss him.

56:18.141 --> 56:20.209
I know how that feels.

56:30.187 --> 56:30.854
Fruit fly, huh?

56:30.855 --> 56:33.857
So, what's it like, having
such a short life cycle?

56:33.858 --> 56:35.959
It's great, mister!
When I grow up...

56:35.960 --> 56:36.793
I'm going to...

56:36.794 --> 56:40.763
wish I had
done more with my life, sonny.

56:44.535 --> 56:50.739
The forest trembles at the
passing of the humble fruit fly.

56:58.415 --> 57:02.919
Excuse me, but I've lost
something very dear to me.

57:02.920 --> 57:07.824
It was left by a friend
who's no longer with us.

57:09.159 --> 57:10.193
Ah!

57:10.194 --> 57:11.895
You found it!

57:11.896 --> 57:15.632
If you want to take this Pod,
you're gonna have to go through us!

57:15.633 --> 57:19.469
Relax. I'm not
going to hurt it.

57:19.470 --> 57:20.437
I need it alive.

57:20.438 --> 57:24.340
Well, we're the only ones that
know how to keep it that way.

57:24.341 --> 57:26.409
Thanks for the tip.

57:38.121 --> 57:40.757
Stay with the Pod,
that's all you had to do.

57:40.758 --> 57:41.424
Yeah, but I just thought...

57:41.425 --> 57:43.793
Do you ever think about
anyone besides yourself?

57:43.794 --> 57:44.961
It wasn't all his fault!

57:44.962 --> 57:47.430
And you. I expected
as much from him.

57:47.431 --> 57:49.065
But I thought you
would know better.

57:49.066 --> 57:50.533
We're really sorry, okay?

57:50.534 --> 57:51.134
I don't want to hear it.

57:51.135 --> 57:54.571
That was the last part of
the queen that I...

57:54.572 --> 57:57.373
That any of us will ever have.

57:57.374 --> 58:00.610
The queen gave it to me. I
should have been here with it.

58:00.611 --> 58:03.146
I'll do whatever it takes
to help you get it back.

58:03.147 --> 58:06.683
I appreciate the offer, but
Wrathwood is too dangerous.

58:06.684 --> 58:07.283
But you can't go alone.

58:07.284 --> 58:12.555
What about the whole leaves-tree
thing that you said?

58:12.556 --> 58:13.523
Nim, tell him.

58:13.524 --> 58:15.825
Look, kid,
the moon's coming up.

58:15.826 --> 58:17.260
That's bloom-or-die time.

58:17.261 --> 58:19.128
So if no one has
a better plan...

58:19.129 --> 58:21.898
Why don't we sneak in,
in disguise?

58:21.899 --> 58:22.465
Great idea.

58:22.466 --> 58:25.835
I'll go as a grasshopper and you
can be my cricket ladyfriend.

58:25.836 --> 58:29.506
It's dangerous, I might get killed.
I thought you'd like that.

58:29.507 --> 58:32.642
I don't have any Boggan armor handy.
Do you?

58:32.643 --> 58:35.777
I know where we can get some.

58:38.214 --> 58:39.315
Well?

58:39.316 --> 58:42.585
I gotta say, six hands
are better than two.

58:42.586 --> 58:45.420
That's been my experience.

58:45.421 --> 58:49.057
You might want to hang on.
Hyah! Whoa!

58:53.196 --> 58:54.898
Stop! Please!

58:54.899 --> 58:59.469
My son was born on
a night like this.

58:59.470 --> 59:01.271
These were his baby fangs.

59:01.272 --> 59:04.307
And here's the first
skin he ever molted.

59:04.308 --> 59:06.376
He was big for a larva.

59:06.377 --> 59:08.077
He took after his mother.

59:08.078 --> 59:12.347
Your stories are
boring and torturous!

59:12.615 --> 59:15.151
And the Leafmen
took him from me.

59:15.152 --> 59:19.489
So I took something of theirs.
It's basic etiquette.

59:19.490 --> 59:22.959
- An eye for an eye.
- Ow!

59:22.960 --> 59:23.693
Jerk!

59:23.694 --> 59:27.096
Tonight your Pod
will bloom here.

59:27.097 --> 59:31.200
And when a Pod blooms in
darkness, it belongs...

59:31.201 --> 59:32.669
to the darkness.

59:32.670 --> 59:36.940
It will become
my little dark prince.

59:36.941 --> 59:38.775
I'll destroy the forest with

59:38.776 --> 59:42.044
the very thing you
hoped would save it.

59:42.913 --> 59:47.584
I hate to break it to you, but it
doesn't say that in the scrolls.

59:47.585 --> 59:50.219
It does in the part I have.

59:50.220 --> 59:51.720
D'oh!

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:11.941
Hey, the Boggan armor...

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.243
where is it?

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:14.978
Over there.

01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:16.912
Let's make this quick.

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:34.463
Come on.

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.941
Ow!

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:56.385
Oh!
Ow!

01:00:56.953 --> 01:01:00.923
That was awesome. Here.

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:03.225
Up we go.

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.228
Ugh! That is
some static cling.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:08.964
No, that's metal, don't touch that!
Whoo!

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:12.535
Ow!

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:14.037
Knock it off.

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.705
Ow. Quit it.

01:01:15.706 --> 01:01:16.806
Ow! No, you quit.

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:18.341
I'm not doing it.
Stop!

01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:19.809
Ow. I'm not doing...

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:21.143
Now!

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.579
Come on.

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:39.429
You know... some of this
stuff looks familiar.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.398
Hey, that's my saddle!

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.966
Where are we?

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:58.180
Oh, it's where this guy lives.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:03.286
I can't believe it.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:06.022
He's been crashing around the
forest like a bear for years.

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:09.726
Most stompers just come and go,
but this guy's relentless.

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:11.728
- Wait. Stompers?
- Yeah.

01:02:11.729 --> 01:02:15.231
Like us, but big and
dumb and slow...

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:17.467
always stomping
on things. Stompers.

01:02:17.468 --> 01:02:20.136
And this one is obsessed
with finding us.

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:21.504
Obviously that's
a security risk.

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:24.607
Can't have one of his big fat
feet stepping on Moonhaven.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:28.745
One of his ginormous,
flabby, dirty, stinky...

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:29.512
Okay, I got it.

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.614
So we've been throwing
him off the trail.

01:02:31.615 --> 01:02:33.382
So you're just
messing with him?

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.051
But he's found all this stuff.

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:37.653
He only finds what
we want him to find.

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:38.254
Look at his map.

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:42.024
We've got him looking
everywhere but where we are.

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:44.360
I love how this guy talks.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:48.264
"Look at this
flower."

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:52.802
"I hurt my
elbow."

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:54.270
I think that's kind of mean.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.772
"Who said that?"

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.940
It's his life's work.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.642
He's my dad!

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:01.711
He what?

01:03:01.712 --> 01:03:03.979
I'm a stomper.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.048
What happened?
You got shrunk?

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:08.818
Yes! Which he knows.

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:10.086
Seriously?

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:11.888
It's been a weird day
for everybody.

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:14.090
You got a problem
with stompers?

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:16.025
A stomper squashed my uncle.

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:18.094
Oh, my gosh. Really?

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:20.630
No. I'm messing with you.

01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:23.866
Too far?

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:27.302
Try it again, maybe
she'll punch you harder.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:43.852
I'm sorry.

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:49.825
I guess she's
right about me, huh, Ozzy?

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:54.163
All I seem to be
able to do is...

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:57.200
drive people away.

01:03:57.201 --> 01:04:00.269
No, Dad,
you didn't! I'm here!

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.873
And you're right about all of it.
Don't stop looking.

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:05.208
Not now.

01:04:10.146 --> 01:04:14.549
Dad! Dad,
just turn around!

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.722
Uh-oh.

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.491
Ozzy...

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:25.160
no kisses.

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.432
Ozzy!

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.072
Hey, how do I look?

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:38.240
Scary as ever.

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.982
Are you okay?

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:51.887
Run!

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:58.593
Ozzy, will you please stop?

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:00.762
Oh! Oh!

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:04.901
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:08.737
They're here!
They're in my house!

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:27.222
No!

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:30.092
Ow!

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:33.596
I hurt my elbow!

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:37.165
Did you hear that?
He said it!

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:39.968
Whoa!

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.664
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:15.204
No! Don't let go!

01:06:15.205 --> 01:06:17.238
Don't let go! No!

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:25.648
Oh, oh!

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:29.317
Hello there, my little friend!

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:31.887
Dad! Dad!

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:34.357
Oh!

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:36.892
Dad! Dad!

01:07:00.816 --> 01:07:02.284
Let's go.

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:05.754
You can't stay.
You're with us now!

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:12.193
I'll come home soon, Dad.
I promise.

01:07:22.271 --> 01:07:24.139
Come on, MK, we gotta go.

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:32.815
You think he's okay?

01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:36.452
Yeah, he'll be fine,
their heads are like rocks.

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:38.586
Uh, smart rocks.

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:02.111
That's a whole lot of ugly.

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:06.048
Ugh! It smells like
something died in here.

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:07.682
Something did.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.392
How do we know where to go?

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:18.193
I've been here before...

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:19.627
with your father.

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:22.898
He never told me about this.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.100
He never got the chance.

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:41.350
How's my dark prince?

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:42.518
It's fine!

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:46.488
Good. Because
if it dies, you die.

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:49.225
We know. You said.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:50.892
Ugly says "what"?

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:51.694
What?

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.761
Nothing.

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:06.908
Shh!

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.171
There's our exit.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:39.241
Meet me back here when you've
got the Pod and the slugs.

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:41.277
How are we supposed
to find them?

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.877
Follow the slime.

01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:46.814
Aren't you coming with us?

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:49.451
I'm gonna make sure
nobody follows you.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:51.886
Don't worry,
you get the easy part...

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:54.122
I get the fun part.

01:09:56.892 --> 01:10:00.061
Hey, look!
It's a Leafman!

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:02.431
I'll keep this simple.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:03.499
I run...

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.567
you try to catch me.

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.045
Let's go.

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.224
When I get big again,
I am so coming

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:31.092
back here with
a can of bug spray.

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:36.397
Mub. Grub.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:39.100
We're down here!

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.972
I told you she'd come for me.

01:10:42.973 --> 01:10:45.874
This girl is smitten.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:48.077
Mmm...
Hand me the Pod!

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:51.280
Oh, come on, you should
work on your grip, my dude.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:52.748
It's a bit womanly.

01:10:54.117 --> 01:10:55.150
No, no, no!

01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:56.585
Whoa, whoa!

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.754
Hurry, before
the guards come back!

01:10:58.755 --> 01:10:59.955
Too late!

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:01.490
I have a plan!
Quick!

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:04.459
Everybody hide in your shells!

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:08.930
Oh. I have
another plan!

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:19.108
Go! Go!

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:20.542
Ow! That hurts!

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:21.910
Those are my eyes!

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:24.112
Can you go any faster?

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:28.383
It's kind of hard when
you're pulling on my brain!

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.159
Ronin!

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.694
What a surprise.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:40.029
I get so few guests.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:44.365
Could be the stench of death.
Some people don't care for it.

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:46.534
It's all right.

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:47.569
Ronin's an old...

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:50.673
What do you call someone
you've known a long time...

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:54.075
and always wanted to destroy?

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.917
I expected you to come.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:04.852
But I didn't think
you'd come alone.

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:07.790
Who said I'm alone?

01:12:11.361 --> 01:12:12.727
Whoa.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.276
Ow!

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:34.283
Ooh! So, what's
the plan here?

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:37.920
A hundred Leafmen?
A thousand?

01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:41.089
Don't flatter yourself.

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:54.169
Well, now I'm just embarrassed.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:57.438
I completely
over-prepared.

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.693
Go, go, go!

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:27.202
I'm afraid you'll
find getting out...

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:30.605
is a lot harder
than getting in.

01:13:39.314 --> 01:13:40.716
Ronin!

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.116
Hang on!

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:46.121
Go! Take the Pod
to Moonhaven!

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:46.922
I'm not leaving without you!

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:52.160
Now you're starting to sound
like a Leafman!

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.963
Ronin!

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:04.405
Come on!

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:24.292
Hyah!

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:09.738
We've been waiting for you.
Where's Ronin?

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:13.007
He gave us a head start.

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.978
But the Boggans
aren't far behind.

01:15:56.485 --> 01:15:58.987
You guys made it!
I knew you would.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:00.589
You got that from the scrolls?

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:03.491
Some things you just know.

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:22.677
Hmm.

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:24.413
Let's see.

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:28.050
Moonlight comes in here,
moves along here...

01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:30.586
reaches the Pod here.

01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:32.487
At the moon's highest peak.

01:16:32.488 --> 01:16:34.790
Only time it can bloom.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:36.325
Do you know what this means?

01:16:36.326 --> 01:16:39.628
We single-handedly
saved the forest!

01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:44.399
Eye five! Down low.
Too slow.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.937
So, when the Pod opens,
what happens to you?

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.505
I think I go home.

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:54.442
Well, I guess this is...

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:58.479
Yeah, I guess it is.

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.012
Mandrake's bats!

01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:49.230
They're not attacking, they're
just blocking out the moon.

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:04.546
Are you ready for this?

01:18:04.547 --> 01:18:05.247
Are you kidding?

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:08.917
We're outnumbered, out of time and
the fate of the world is at stake.

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:10.285
Why did I quit again?

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:11.186
See you up there.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.889
As soon as I can
find my helmet.

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.557
Thank you.
Hey, guys!

01:18:15.558 --> 01:18:18.627
I'm going to need a uniform!
And a bird!

01:18:18.628 --> 01:18:20.028
Oh, that's...
You...

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:23.031
That's all right.
I'll find them myself.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.865
A Leafman makes do.

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:00.802
What are you doing?

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.504
I'm going to help.
Whoa, whoa.

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:04.039
You heard the queen!
If you want to get home...

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:07.209
you have to be here with
the Pod when it blooms.

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:08.744
Isn't that what you want?

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:10.278
So I should just sit here?

01:19:10.279 --> 01:19:11.379
I didn't say that.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:12.714
Then I'm going up there.

01:19:12.715 --> 01:19:14.182
I didn't say that either.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.084
You don't even know
what you're saying.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.320
I'm saying, who gives
up everything...

01:19:18.321 --> 01:19:21.155
for a world that's
not even theirs?

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.594
Dad. My dad does!

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:26.661
I have to get my dad!

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:27.696
Where do you think
you're going?

01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:30.432
The queen said I was
here for a reason.

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:32.234
This must be it.

01:19:32.235 --> 01:19:34.034
That's my girl.

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:39.206
Hyah!

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:43.544
Oh, come on!

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:04.665
Mandrake! He's headed
for Moonhaven!

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:13.007
Grub! The Pod! It's
blooming in darkness!

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:20.881
Whoa! Hyah!

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:23.618
Hey, Dad!

01:20:23.619 --> 01:20:25.821
Come on, I need your help!

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:33.093
Whoa, whoa!

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:54.216
They're all
right about me, Ozzy.

01:20:54.217 --> 01:20:57.752
All these years just chasing
things that aren't even there.

01:20:57.753 --> 01:21:00.088
I actually thought
I saw my daughter,

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:03.824
two inches tall,
stuck in a bug jar.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:06.460
I've lost my mind.

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:09.196
And I am talking to a dog.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.004
Hey, Dad!

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:19.006
Come on, I need your help, Dad!

01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:21.609
What? No! No!

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:24.579
Dad, look at me!

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:28.549
I'm right here!
Just check your cameras!

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.623
Ozzy, please.

01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:36.790
I've made up my mind, okay?

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:38.493
Quiet!

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:41.196
I don't care anymore.

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:44.732
All I want now,
is to find my daughter!

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.435
Dad, please!

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:49.436
Please, I need you.

01:22:14.764 --> 01:22:16.697
Oh!

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:35.616
I am so over Boggans.

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.286
Ah!

01:22:46.695 --> 01:22:47.995
Ozzy!

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.035
Dad!

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:15.924
Don't faint!

01:23:15.925 --> 01:23:19.326
I won't!

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:21.830
<i>How did you find me?</i>

01:23:21.831 --> 01:23:26.468
I got your message.

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:28.737
<i>You were right.</i>

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:31.171
About what?

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.341
<i>About everything.</i>

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:36.844
I'm sorry.

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.114
Me, too.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:46.354
How did you get so small?

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:51.058
<i>Dad, it was amazing!
They're real!</i>

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:55.629
And they need your help.

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:59.600
<i>Follow me!</i>

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.246
Missed me.

01:24:11.247 --> 01:24:13.915
I wasn't aiming for you.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.917
Ooh! This must be
the delivery room.

01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:51.286
Whoa! Boy, are you lost!
Down the hall...

01:24:51.287 --> 01:24:56.357
make a left, and then when you see
the janitor with a weird eye...

01:24:56.358 --> 01:24:58.293
Shut up!

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.164
My dark prince.

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:04.566
Come to Daddy.

01:25:04.567 --> 01:25:07.235
I don't think it likes you.

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:07.502
Ronin!

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:10.672
You know how many Boggans
I had to fight to get here?

01:25:10.673 --> 01:25:12.774
Seriously, I lost count.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:15.042
Well, what's one more?

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:23.985
It's all real!

01:25:23.986 --> 01:25:25.954
It's really here!

01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:29.491
Dad, the bats! We have to get
them away from the moon.

01:25:29.492 --> 01:25:33.194
It's so beautiful.

01:25:33.195 --> 01:25:34.262
There's no time!

01:25:34.263 --> 01:25:38.967
But what matters most is...

01:25:38.968 --> 01:25:42.035
Not now!

01:25:52.347 --> 01:25:52.614
Oh!

01:25:52.615 --> 01:25:55.783
Oh, you want me
to play the frequencies that...

01:25:55.784 --> 01:25:59.086
attract the...

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:10.532
Run!
I'll find you, Dad!

01:26:10.533 --> 01:26:13.267
I just have to
get back before...

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:16.170
Oh! Oh!

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:17.839
Ow, ow, ow!

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.574
They really do go in your hair!

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:31.619
This time, when
I leave you for dead...

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.253
you'll stay that way!

01:26:35.591 --> 01:26:38.726
What's that little
saying you people have?

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:42.230
"Lots of leaves,
something-something"?

01:26:42.231 --> 01:26:44.365
Very inspiring.

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:49.236
But in the end every leaf
falls and dies alone.

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.839
No one is alone.

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:58.812
Not even him.

01:28:46.354 --> 01:28:49.089
Look after them for me.

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:57.197
There's that smile.

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.283
Your Majesty.

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:39.206
You look terrible.

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:42.477
Hey, did you see how
many times I got hit?

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:44.045
I learned that from you.

01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:46.247
You're not going to make
me say all the stuff...

01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:47.648
I learned from
you now, are you?

01:29:47.649 --> 01:29:51.219
Well, you'd have learned a heck
of a lot more from your dad.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.921
I was a pretty poor substitute.

01:29:53.922 --> 01:29:58.359
Don't beat yourself up. Lately
you've shown some real promise.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.761
Oh, please.

01:29:59.762 --> 01:30:02.162
Just say you love each other.

01:30:02.830 --> 01:30:04.499
I thought we just did.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.034
Hey, you're still here.

01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:08.636
Yeah.

01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:10.705
I guess I missed my chance.

01:30:10.706 --> 01:30:11.939
I'm sorry.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:15.475
But not completely sorry.

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:18.946
Wow! Strong grip!

01:30:18.947 --> 01:30:19.480
What's happening?

01:30:19.481 --> 01:30:23.951
A queen brought you here. How
about a queen sends you back?

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:27.954
It's working!

01:30:29.323 --> 01:30:30.758
We have to say goodbye!

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:31.859
What for?

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:32.827
You're part of us.

01:30:32.828 --> 01:30:35.596
Many leaves, I always say.

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:38.499
I mean, the Leafmen say.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.636
Not that I'm a Leafman.

01:30:41.637 --> 01:30:44.104
Says who?

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:46.640
We'll find each other!

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:49.142
Just follow the slime!

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.511
I will, Mub.

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:53.748
You're really leaving.

01:30:53.749 --> 01:30:56.516
Put your arms around me.

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:44.365
I always hoped if I, uh...

01:31:44.366 --> 01:31:47.467
if I proved it to her...

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:52.305
she'd, uh...

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:55.008
you know.

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:10.525
Well, what do you think?

01:32:10.526 --> 01:32:11.692
It's perfect, Dad.

01:32:11.693 --> 01:32:15.296
Except, the boots are higher
and the sleeves are longer.

01:32:15.297 --> 01:32:18.766
And they wear actual
helmets, not acorns.

01:32:18.767 --> 01:32:19.166
Really?

01:32:19.167 --> 01:32:22.837
They should seriously
consider the potential.

01:32:22.838 --> 01:32:24.437
Ozzy!

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.608
Here you go, boy.

01:32:35.684 --> 01:32:37.385
Um...

01:32:37.386 --> 01:32:40.220
Go. It's
always for you, anyway.

01:32:45.393 --> 01:32:47.028
Hey.
<i>Hey!</i>

01:32:47.029 --> 01:32:47.461
How's work?

01:32:47.462 --> 01:32:49.230
<i>No, it's not work
when you love your job.</i>

01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:52.934
<i>"Many leaves, one tree,"
that's what I always say.</i>

01:32:52.935 --> 01:32:53.501
Uh-huh.

01:32:53.502 --> 01:32:56.137
What do you think
you're doing, Leafboy?

01:32:56.138 --> 01:32:58.906
Leafman. You know
it's Leafman.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:32:59.574
Is it?

01:32:59.575 --> 01:33:02.376
<i>I wasn't sure.
Hey, MK!</i>

01:33:02.377 --> 01:33:04.878
<i>What's going on, baby girl?</i>

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:06.414
Hi, Mub.

01:33:06.415 --> 01:33:07.114
We were talking.

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:09.650
There's a big sack of
"shut your flat face"

01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:10.651
over there by that tree.

01:33:10.652 --> 01:33:12.386
<i>Why don't you go pick it up?</i>

01:33:12.387 --> 01:33:13.955
Listen, slick.
<i>Guys, don't fight.</i>

01:33:13.956 --> 01:33:18.793
Oh, it won't be a fight. I could whip
him with both eyes behind my back.

01:33:18.794 --> 01:33:20.494
<i>I'd like to see
you try, jelly butt.</i>

01:33:20.495 --> 01:33:23.530
<i>I didn't want to
have to do this!</i>

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.300
Ew!

01:33:26.301 --> 01:33:29.903
Mub, get him out of your mouth!

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:34.875
Dad, I gotta go Heimlich
my friend out of a slug.

01:33:34.876 --> 01:33:37.244
Yeah, that looks pretty weird.

01:33:37.245 --> 01:33:39.479
Here don't forget this.

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:44.785
Tell them about
the acorn helmets.

01:33:44.786 --> 01:33:47.688
Or you could
tell them yourself.

01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:48.222
Oh!

01:33:48.223 --> 01:33:50.024
