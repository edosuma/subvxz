00:06.974 --> 00:10.376
GRACE: <i> Sam, my daughter,</i>
<i> Emma, she's gone.</i>

00:10.378 --> 00:11.043
I'm Charlie Manson.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.444
Obviously, finding her
is the important thing,

00:12.446 --> 00:17.082
but if you can keep it quiet,
there are people
who'd appreciate it.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.520
Name Manson ring a bell?
Your husband was his lawyer.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.822
I don't think this is about
Manson and your daughter.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.591
<i> It's about Manson</i>
<i> and your husband.</i>

00:25.593 --> 00:26.792
Rue Fisher.
I'm the engineer.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.061
You come to make some music
with us, Rue?

00:29.063 --> 00:31.130
<i> You shared your good</i>
<i> with me, man.</i>

00:31.132 --> 00:32.865
I brought you two presents.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.534
They're yours, man,
for as long as you want them.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.368
-Sam.
-Kristin.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.905

<i> Don't lead a subtle life.</i>
<i> Thought you ought to know.</i>

OPAL: I didn't open it.

00:44.345 --> 00:47.046
He's going to prison
because of you.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.447
That's the coffee hut.
That's Art Gladner.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.716
Some guy owned a diner
or something,
stabbed to death?

00:50.718 --> 00:52.051
SHAFE: I've been working
that place for months.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.786
Art Gladner was my endgame.
I'm going...

00:53.788 --> 00:55.120
Well, who's going?
Shafe the drug tout,

00:55.122 --> 00:56.622
or Shafe the cop
who's gonna blow his cover?

00:56.624 --> 00:59.358
SAM: There's a suspect.
It's your boy, Vickery.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.604
Too short. Too short.
Too short.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.639
Too left-handed.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.375
-Cerebral palsy.
-Who else had a key?

01:16.377 --> 01:19.111
Three sets of keys,
two waitresses, one cook,

01:19.113 --> 01:24.583
all at a wedding in riverside
the day Gladner bought it.
So...

01:24.585 --> 01:25.350
We're at zero.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.251
I'm gonna go talk
with the grieving widow.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.788
The only thing that makes
more sense than a drug dealer
getting killed over drugs...

01:29.790 --> 01:32.991
...is anyone getting killed
by someone they married.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.128
Look at you.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.063
A learner.

01:38.065 --> 01:38.997
Now learn this.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.732
The widow Gladner
is a career gal,

01:40.734 --> 01:43.602
and guess what
she's the proprietress of.

01:44.738 --> 01:45.737
-Seriously?
-Yes, my son.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.574
All right, although
I'm touched to witness
this tender moment

01:48.576 --> 01:50.442
of mentoring,
I need to remind
you lovebirds,

01:50.444 --> 01:53.011
you're mooning over each other
on my case, my time,

01:53.013 --> 01:55.481
and I'm seeing today
what I saw yesterday.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.082
The doer's
your little snitch.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.585
-Eh, I don't think so.
-Yeah, I know.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.153
Blows your drug case to bits,
doesn't it?

02:01.155 --> 02:03.288
Sammy, tell this kid
to put on his big boy undies

02:03.290 --> 02:04.957
and make friends
with disappointment.

02:04.959 --> 02:05.757
SAM: Oh, what do
you care, Cut?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.025
If Vickery's the guy,
then you get all the credit,

02:07.027 --> 02:09.995
and if we nab the actual doer,
then you get all the credit.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.631
I'm the one who's got
to visit the grieving widow.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.166
That's always a pleasure.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.033
You know,
I can see her now.

02:15.035 --> 02:19.538
She's got her hair in curlers,
housedress,
arms like batwings,

02:19.540 --> 02:21.406
three housecats,
or something like that.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.841
Crying, crying, crying,

02:22.843 --> 02:23.909
and, yep, there goes
another handkerchief.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.745
-Sammy, you do
these things to yourself.
-Yeah?

02:26.747 --> 02:29.148
I know, Cut. I know.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.389

I'm not exactly
your model grieving widow,

03:41.021 --> 03:42.721

to the coffee hut?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.791
No, me and Artie had not
shared much in a long time.

03:45.793 --> 03:49.661

03:49.663 --> 03:51.129

I couldn't help.

Emma was singing.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.376
-I know her voice.
-Grace.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.811
I couldn't even look at Ken
after that.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.846
I did this.

04:40.848 --> 04:44.750
I called her a whore
right before she ran away.

04:44.752 --> 04:48.086
Her face turned white
like I had slapped her,

04:48.088 --> 04:50.222
and I was so relieved.

04:52.159 --> 04:56.728
I knew that if she's hurt
by that,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.730
then she's still a girl,

12:46.533 --> 12:47.932
You are not a good person.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.434
Tell you what,
I get you out of here,

12:49.436 --> 12:54.205
you go talk to this fat cat,
I don't exist.

12:54.207 --> 12:54.572
Better?

12:54.574 --> 12:58.109
'Cause I've got
so many reasons to trust you?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.944
Actually,

13:00.580 --> 13:04.082
I am the only person
you can trust right now.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.986
I need to kill myself.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.188
Wait a minute.
So you want to take the one

13:10.190 --> 13:13.658
and only suspect
in my murder case
out on a field trip, why?

13:13.660 --> 13:14.592
You know what,
don't answer that.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.694
It's gonna be a word salad
of three things I hate.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.663
Boring, complicated,
and useless.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.165
It's not like Vickery's
gonna get away from me.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.933
And he could take me
up the food chain

13:21.935 --> 13:22.834
to the actual source
of the heroin.

13:22.836 --> 13:26.204
Sam, can you muzzle this mutt
before I beat his ass
with a newspaper?

13:26.206 --> 13:27.205
No, but I'll sell tickets.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.341
OFFICER: Call at the desk
about Mrs. Hodiak.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.478
Bartender at McGillicuddy's
says she's won't stop crying.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.847
He doesn't know what to do.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.485
Is today the 15th?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.654
Uh, yeah. I forgot.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.189
Um, I should go.

13:44.191 --> 13:48.459
You should
if you were her husband.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.700
MAN: <i> Sorry.</i>
<i> Had to call someone.</i>

13:55.702 --> 13:58.236
She's been over there
crying since I opened.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.405
-Bad for business.
-Hmm, yeah.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.640
If your regulars wanted
to listen to a woman cry,

14:02.642 --> 14:04.375
I guess they could stay
at home, right?

14:04.377 --> 14:08.379
Can you help me out here
instead of busting
my hump, Sam?

14:09.249 --> 14:13.685
A little early in the day
for you even, considering.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.854
Tell me what
the note said.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.355
Walt's note.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.056
Let me guess,

14:18.058 --> 14:21.125
you'll slap my face
if I don't.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.130
Opal,

14:26.633 --> 14:28.633
you been sleeping?

14:28.902 --> 14:31.202
Yeah, I've been sleeping.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.005
I've been sleeping
and dreaming about Walt.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.110
It said, "I'm not running.

14:39.112 --> 14:42.714
"I'm doing what I have to do.
I love you."

14:43.416 --> 14:46.184
Then just his name.
That's it.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.719
What are you gonna do
to find him?

14:47.721 --> 14:49.087
-What am I gonna do
to find him?
-Yeah.

14:49.089 --> 14:54.025
I thought I was the bad guy,
and now I'm supposed
to find him?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.466
I was listening to him
when he was on the phone.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.668
He thought I was in the tub.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.536
He called Dave Vitrano.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.572
Pop Warner football
Dave Vitrano?

15:07.574 --> 15:08.640
Pat Vitrano's son?

15:08.642 --> 15:11.209
Yeah, you're the detective.

15:11.211 --> 15:11.542
(SCOFFS)

15:11.544 --> 15:13.945
It's unfortunate you couldn't
have told me this earlier,
Opal.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.079
-I just...
-Is there any other
information

15:15.081 --> 15:17.649
-you want
to dribble out right now?
-Okay, just find him.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.284
Then you can say
anything you want to me,

15:19.286 --> 15:22.420
but right now please shut up
and find him.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.662
Um...

15:31.898 --> 15:34.265
Cut know what
day it is today?

15:36.036 --> 15:37.802
Yeah, well, um...

15:38.405 --> 15:40.038
Happy birthday.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.474
Thanks for not singing.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.413
Cut's a great singer.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.949
Yeah, just ask him.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.187
SAM: <i> He called you</i>
<i> from his mother's house,</i>

15:56.189 --> 15:57.789
<i> didn't know she was listening.</i>

15:57.791 --> 15:59.524
Did he come here?

15:59.793 --> 16:04.395
I just want to help him.
I'm not here as a cop
right now.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.532
Well, maybe Walt
doesn't know that.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.000
That's what he said?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.568
I didn't talk to him.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.270
Dave, I can get
your phone records.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.839
I can see who called here
and for how long.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.441
I thought you said
you weren't a cop, right...

16:16.443 --> 16:17.408
Did he say where
he was going?

16:17.410 --> 16:20.144
-Mr. Hodiak, I don't...
-Did he ask for money?

16:20.146 --> 16:23.414
-I don't have any money.
-Why are you here?

16:23.783 --> 16:26.551
My mom...
The icebox motor broke,
so I just came...

16:26.553 --> 16:30.621
No, why are you here?
Why are you not there?

16:32.125 --> 16:33.791
I'm a seminarian.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.828
-Ah.
-Our lady queen of angels.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.129
Huh.

16:38.598 --> 16:42.967
Is that a new thing,
or is that something

16:42.969 --> 16:46.070
you always wanted to be,
a priest?

16:46.339 --> 16:50.675
-It's hard to believe,
I guess.
-No. It's convenient.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.948
I fought,

16:56.950 --> 17:01.619
so we could sit here free
on plastic slipcovers.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.822
Does God not believe
in that anymore?

17:04.824 --> 17:07.992
-No, I know he does...
-Shut your mouth.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.029
Do you know where Walt is?

17:14.601 --> 17:17.335
Go fix your mother's
icebox motor.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.270
Can I have some?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.063
Your wife okay?

18:52.065 --> 18:54.632
Not even on her best day.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.368
Sorry.

18:57.437 --> 19:02.940
Listen, I appreciate
everything you've done
for me on Gladner,

19:03.710 --> 19:04.408
but maybe Cutler's right, huh?

19:04.410 --> 19:07.411
Oh, you don't want
to say that out loud.
He might hear you,

19:07.413 --> 19:10.548
and you know how objectionable
he is right now.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.284
Vickery could have done it.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.185
What do I know?

19:14.187 --> 19:15.720
About homicide? Not much.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.990
Fortunately I do,
and I stink at taking advice,

19:18.992 --> 19:22.160
so onward to glory,
young buck.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.831
(SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

19:27.667 --> 19:29.834
I swear none of us knew
any of that drug stuff

19:29.836 --> 19:31.936
until we read it
in the papers.

19:31.938 --> 19:34.071
Art wasn't like that.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.306
He was...

19:35.308 --> 19:37.341
"Sweet.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.210
"Generous.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.545
"Fun.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.180
"Loving.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.782
"All man, all the time."

19:44.851 --> 19:46.717
(CRYING) All the girls
were crazy about him.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.388
-SAM: <i> How'd the boss</i>
<i> feel about that?</i>
<i> -Boss?</i>

19:53.326 --> 19:53.824
Oh, Mrs. G.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.661
Well, I wouldn't call her
the boss.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.095
Art ran things.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.063
Did he, now?

19:59.065 --> 20:03.267
It was his place,
and we were his family.

20:09.075 --> 20:13.744
Rachel, will you...
Will you help me
get a picture here?

20:14.247 --> 20:18.716
Um, the Gladners are married,
but, you know.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.152
They're... They're fun.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.255
You know?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.189
Getting there.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.525
WOMAN: Oh, you're ticklish.

20:28.795 --> 20:33.097
Lucille liked to get
dressed up, go out,
big groups.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.433
She called it
"fanning her tail."

20:35.435 --> 20:36.734
You know, peacocking.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.869
Oh, that's a fresh one.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.174
But Art, he just liked
to stay in, you know?

20:43.176 --> 20:46.143
But he was the boss here
and at the coffee hut.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.645
Yeah.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.146
Oh, yeah.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.781
And he cared, you know?

20:50.783 --> 20:52.283
I mean,
not that Lucille doesn't.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.152
She's a nice woman,
but Art...

20:56.389 --> 20:58.189
Colors...
Your colors are running.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.690
(CHUCKLES)

21:01.361 --> 21:05.796
You know, he made me feel,
I don't know, taken care of.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.268
Even if it was
something stupid.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.403
(SNIFFLES) Like, God,
this one time,

21:12.405 --> 21:17.808
I accidentally left my purse
at the coffee hut,
and it got locked in.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.945
Well, he was
such a gentleman.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.947
He took care of everything.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.282
Yeah.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.518
You say your purse
got locked in?

21:28.588 --> 21:30.021
Yeah.

21:30.023 --> 21:30.955
(SNIFFLES)

21:30.957 --> 21:32.356
SAM: Hey, Marvin. Hey.

21:32.358 --> 21:38.596
I heard a funny story
about you from Rachel
at the Peach Pussycat.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.730
She says hi, by the way.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.566
Seems one night she went over
to visit Art Gladner.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.136
They "chatted" in the bathroom
for a little while,

21:45.138 --> 21:48.773
and she had to go be onstage.
He had to go.
He had a meeting.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.374
She left. He locked up.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.710
What'd she forget?
Her purse.

21:52.712 --> 21:56.080
Do what I'm doing.
Just like that.

21:56.082 --> 22:02.453
And who did Lucille Gladner
tell her to call
to go pick up that purse?

22:02.455 --> 22:02.987
You.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.423
Because even though you
deliver to 70 other eateries

22:05.425 --> 22:07.458
in the greater
Los Angeles area,

22:07.460 --> 22:08.926
Art Gladner trusted you.

22:08.928 --> 22:12.697
Which is odd, considering
that you have nine arrests

22:12.699 --> 22:16.934
and two convictions
for a whole other type
of delivery.

22:16.936 --> 22:23.341
Schedule-A narcotics.
But that didn't seem
to bother old Art. No.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.977
He even gave you
your own...

22:26.979 --> 22:28.212
Yahtzee!

22:28.414 --> 22:31.048
Oh, come on.
Okay there, Marv.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.583
Your gun on the ground. Now.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.918
-Mmm, no.
-Do it!

22:33.920 --> 22:35.319
You're armed.
You should come get it.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.955
You got a 20% chance
of getting it that way,
or you can run.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.358
Then you got 100% chance
that I'm gonna shoot you,

22:40.360 --> 22:42.460
so... (INHALES DEEPLY)

22:42.628 --> 22:46.764
What's it gonna be, Marvin?
Come on. I don't have all day.
Chop-chop.

22:48.267 --> 22:51.135
All right, look.
Let me make it easy for you.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.672
(GROANING)

22:55.742 --> 22:57.007
Oh, okay.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.211
That's all right, Marv.
No shame in trying.

23:00.213 --> 23:04.382
Here, give me that arm, man.
This part's gonna hurt.

23:04.384 --> 23:05.850
(SCREAMS)

23:05.852 --> 23:08.119
God, that hurts so much.

23:08.121 --> 23:09.754
You broke it, you prick.

23:09.756 --> 23:13.691
The hospital's a short stroll
that-a-way. No? Okay.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.193
Thanks, that's... Wow.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.828
You should do that
professionally.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.096
We're a ways
from the whole picture,

23:19.098 --> 23:21.465
but your little pal Vickery
is free to go.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.633
-Damn it.
-What?

23:22.635 --> 23:25.302
No, I've got Vickery
primed to take me
to his alibi,

23:25.304 --> 23:26.170
and he's pissing
in his shorts about it.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.840
No threat of jail,
no way he takes me to him,
and I want him.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.809
It sounds like he's higher up
in all this than
any of these cats.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.879
Great, so don't tell him.
Nobody saw me
bring this guy in.

23:34.881 --> 23:35.780
He hasn't even been
booked yet.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.182
As far as anybody knows,
Vickery's still
the only suspect.

23:38.184 --> 23:41.152
Wait, you're saying
let him keep thinking
he's on the hook?

23:41.154 --> 23:43.020
News travels slow.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.022
Okay,
but that would be illegal.

23:45.024 --> 23:48.192
(SIGHS) Don't brag
when it works.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.231
I'm trying
to clear up the dates here.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.500
Look, I hate to
piss on your mood,

23:56.502 --> 23:59.904
but Lieutenant wants
a post-mortem on our breakup.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.472
-Now?
-Both of us.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.873
Fantastic.

24:05.178 --> 24:06.477
Lieutenant Priore, it's Cut.

24:06.479 --> 24:07.711
Maybe he's having a think.

24:07.713 --> 24:10.181
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-Lieutenant?

24:11.751 --> 24:13.384
Oh, Sam!

24:16.589 --> 24:19.457
Hey, get an
ambulance in here!

24:19.892 --> 24:22.393
What the... Come on.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.669
This is the worst milkshake,
like, ever.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.537
-Okay, Mikey.
-How do you ruin
a milkshake?

24:33.539 --> 24:36.207
You do this right,
I'll buy you a dairy farm,
okay?

24:36.209 --> 24:38.342
What I want is the smack
that you promised me.

24:38.344 --> 24:40.044
-Let's just go over it again.
-I got it, okay?

24:40.046 --> 24:43.447
I rap with him long enough
for you to get
a good look at him,

24:43.449 --> 24:46.116
try to get him to talk
about associates or locales.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.118
-Okay, you ready?
-Oh, my God.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.020
-I swear to God.
-Just leave the milkshake.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.722
They put garlic
in this thing, man.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.691

like everything you touch
or look at or...

38:59.805 --> 39:00.904
Now...

39:00.906 --> 39:03.239
You need to leave.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.444
I'm not going.
This is my home.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.281
Says who?

39:18.990 --> 39:22.392
MANSON: (DISTORTED)
You get back what you put out.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.928
That's karma.

39:24.930 --> 39:27.797
That's the balance
of your own will.

39:27.899 --> 39:32.836
You got to be judged
by your own God,
inside your own soul.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.072
That devil,
the pig who wears the crown?

39:36.074 --> 39:40.410
He locked me up, too,
to teach me a lesson.

39:42.481 --> 39:46.549
So I found my truth
inside me.

39:47.853 --> 39:51.488
It's in you. I see it.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.090
This is who you are.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.960
Glorious daughter of Eve.

39:56.962 --> 40:00.830
You're so beautiful, you...
You hurt my eyes.

40:01.366 --> 40:04.467
Look at her,
our child.

40:04.469 --> 40:07.137
She's the mirror to all of us.

40:07.139 --> 40:11.474
She is you, and you are...

40:11.476 --> 40:12.809
Mother.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.945
Emma, honey, I found you.

40:16.415 --> 40:16.980
You're safe now.

40:16.982 --> 40:21.885
-It's time to go home, okay?
-Okay, Mommy. Take me home.

40:21.887 --> 40:22.986
GRACE: Okay, sweetheart.

40:22.988 --> 40:26.256
Just take my hand,
and let's go home.

40:26.258 --> 40:28.691
-Okay?
-Okay.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.928
GRACE: You're safe now.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.764
(CHUCKLES)

40:37.436 --> 40:39.936
Emma, you don't belong here.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.538
This is not your home.

40:41.540 --> 40:42.272
I do belong here.

40:42.274 --> 40:44.040
-Emma, they don't love you.
-They do.

40:44.042 --> 40:47.110
-What did they do to you?
-No! No!

40:47.112 --> 40:48.611
-Sweetheart, please come home.
-No!

40:48.613 --> 40:51.448
-Emma, calm down.
-No! No! No!

40:51.450 --> 40:53.650
You can't take me away
from my family!

40:53.652 --> 40:55.919
You can't take me away
from him!

40:55.921 --> 40:57.320
No.

40:57.422 --> 40:59.823
Sweetheart, calm down.
Put the gun down.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.357
Stay there. No. No.

41:01.359 --> 41:02.592
GRACE: Emma,
you're gonna
get in that car,

41:02.594 --> 41:03.827
and we're gonna go home
right now.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.094
EMMA: No, you can't make me.

41:05.096 --> 41:06.729
Emma, baby, calm down.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.097
Don't move!

41:09.568 --> 41:10.900
(GUNSHOT)

41:10.902 --> 41:13.002
(YELLING INDISTINCTLY)

41:13.004 --> 41:15.104
Aah! No! What?

41:15.106 --> 41:16.806
-No!
-Let her go!

41:16.808 --> 41:18.341
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

41:18.343 --> 41:22.245
-Don't let them take me!
-You... You stay away
from her.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.747
You all stay away
from my daughter.

41:26.318 --> 41:29.152
Everybody relax.
She'll be back.

41:29.154 --> 41:32.755
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

41:33.124 --> 41:34.591
Stop! Let me down!

41:34.593 --> 41:37.060
No! I'm not Emma!
I'm not Emma!

41:37.062 --> 41:39.262
I'm not Emma! Stop!

41:39.264 --> 41:42.699
You're the devil!
I hate you! I hate you!

41:42.701 --> 41:45.502
No! Let me out of here!
Let me out!

41:45.504 --> 41:47.270
A liar and a whore!

41:47.272 --> 41:49.739
(INDISTINCT SCREAMING)

41:51.543 --> 41:53.743
Let me out of here!

41:53.845 --> 41:55.311
Stop! Stop the car!

41:55.313 --> 42:01.184
Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie, help me! Charlie!
