SO LOCAL A.T.F. IS HANDING
HIS PHOTO OUT TO THE VENDORS.

SECURE HER PHONE.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.521

08:18.932 --> 08:21.769
- OKAY, THAT'S NOT
RASMUSSEN.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.804

08:30.911 --> 08:32.245
HE WAS JUST
GIVING ME A RIDE.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.616
- OKAY. WHAT IS ALL THIS?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.585

TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION,

08:37.618 --> 08:38.786

I GOT THE TIME.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.594
I KNOW YOU.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.762
YOU ARRESTED ME BEFORE?
- NO.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.899
BUT 20 YEARS AGO, A JOHN
WAS GETTING ROUGH

08:51.932 --> 08:54.635
WITH YOU IN THE CAR,
AND YOU WOULDN'T PRESS CHARGES.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.969
IT WAS THE SAME GUY.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.071
- IF YOU SAY SO.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.674
I HATE IT WHEN THEY HIT ME
IN THE TEETH--

09:00.708 --> 09:02.342
OR THE EYES.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.177
THEN YOU GET FLOATERS,
THAT'S THE WORST.

I HAVE A LOT OF DATES.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.621
IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.588
IT'S NOT LIKE
I KNOW HIM WELL.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.624
- CRAIG RASMUSSEN?

HE'S CALLED YOU
ALMOST ONCE A WEEK

09:18.826 --> 09:21.328

09:23.330 --> 09:25.298
WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME QUESTIONS?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.000
AND WHAT DID HE DO?

09:27.034 --> 09:29.269
ALL THESE COPS, IT AIN'T
BECAUSE HE'S A JOHN.

TILL HE COULDN'T.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.667
- HE'S A REAL LOUSY DRUNK.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.268
I COUL SMELL IT
ON HIS BREATH.

10:01.301 --> 10:05.739
HE WAS IN A REAL BAD MOOD
TONIGHT.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.307
IS THIS HER?

10:07.340 --> 10:10.077
- HIS WIFE, YES.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.679
WHERE IS HE, JEANNIE?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.246
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.983
- BUT YOU DID
SEE HIM TONIGHT?

10:16.016 --> 10:17.250
- YEAH.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.386
HE PICKED ME UP
ON EAST BAY AVENUE.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.822
BUT IT WASN'T
HIS REGULAR CAR.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.323
IT WAS A HONDA.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.292
- WHAT COLOR?
WHAT TIME?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.994
- 10:00, 10:30.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.395
SILVER, I THINK.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.798
AND USUALLY WE HAVE THE DATE
IN THE BACK OF HIS CAR,

10:30.831 --> 10:32.365
BUT HE WANTED
TO GO TO A MOTEL.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.934
- WHERE?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.003
- YANKEE MOTOR INN,
OFF THE CROSS BRONX.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.171
- AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

10:38.205 --> 10:39.707
- NOTHING.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.274
WE GO TO GET THE ROOM.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.976
HE COMES BACK.
HE TELLS ME HE HAS 20 BUCKS.

10:43.010 --> 10:45.112
HE WANTS IT AROUND THE WORLD,
HE'LL PAY ME LATER.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.780
I SAY, "HONEY,
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.281
"20 BUCKS GET YOU A JACK.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.783
AND THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE
WE'RE FRIENDS."

10:49.817 --> 10:50.951
SO HE GETS REAL PISSED.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.020
I TOLD YOU,
HE WAS IN A MOOD.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.354
I JUST WALKED OUT.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.223
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
HE STAYED IN THE ROOM?

10:56.256 --> 10:58.091
- WELL, HE PROBABLY
GOT HIMSELF OFF.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.392
I SHOULDA
KEPT THAT 20 BUCKS.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.994
- WELL, HE HASN'T SLEPT
SINCE THIS BEGAN.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.395
HE COULD
STILL BE UP THERE.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.267
- CAPTAIN, CLERK SAYS
RASMUSSEN HASN'T CHECKED OUT.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.769
THE HONDA'S STILL
IN THE PARKING LOT.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.003
WE'RE ON IT.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.004
- SO THEY WAS ONLY
IN THE ROOM

11:11.038 --> 11:12.339
FOR, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.340
THEN THE HOOKER COMES OUT

11:13.373 --> 11:15.075
AND ASKS ME
TO CALL HER A CAB.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.877
SOME OTHER GUY OFFERS HER A LIFT
AND I FELL ASLEEP,

11:16.910 --> 11:18.746
BUT THIS IS ROOM 206.

11:18.779 --> 11:22.382
- POLICE!
SEARCH WARRANT!

11:22.415 --> 11:24.317
- FIN.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.296
- WE GOT ONE. CALL A BUS.
- ONE LEADER TO CENTRAL.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.331
- TWO. GUYS, WE NEED A BUS
IN HERE NOW.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.233
- YEAH, I'VE GOT
MULTIPLE CASUALTIES.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.370
WE NEED A BUS SENT
TO OUR LOCATION.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.471
- GOT THREE.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.106
TAKE IT EASY, MAN, OKAY?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.440
HELP'S ON THE WAY.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.009
- [unsteadily]
HE BANGS ON THE DOOR

11:49.042 --> 11:51.378
AND SAYS WE'RE TOO LOUD,
THEN STARTS SHOOTING.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.981
[gagging]
OH, GOD...

11:54.014 --> 11:55.983
- DON'T TRY TO TALK, MAN,
OKAY?

11:56.016 --> 11:59.019
- PLEASE DON'T TELL MY MOM.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.895
- GUNSHOTS. YOU DON'T CALL 911?

12:07.928 --> 12:09.296
- I DIDN'T HEAR NO GUNSHOTS.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.031
NO, I HAD MY HEADPHONES ON.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.099
I TOLD Y'ALL,
I WAS ASLEEP.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.433
LOOK, NOBODY EVER SAID
ANYTHING.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.968
- WHAT YOU MEAN IS
NO ONE HERE WANTS

12:15.002 --> 12:16.136
THE POLICE TO KNOW
THEIR BUSINESS.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.971
- EXACTLY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:18.005 --> 12:19.840
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE
YOUR SECURITY FOOTAGE

12:19.873 --> 12:21.474
FROM THIS PARKING LOT,
YOUR OFFICE, THESE HALLWAYS--

12:21.508 --> 12:22.976
- COUPLE REPORTED
THEIR CAR'S BEEN STOLEN.

12:23.010 --> 12:26.513
- MAKE, MODEL,
LICENSE NUMBER?

12:26.546 --> 12:29.016
DID YOU ASK?

12:29.049 --> 12:31.952
- RASMUSSEN LEFT THE MOTEL
IN A STOLEN SUBARU.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.987
LAST SEEN HEADING SOUTH
TOWARD HUNTS POINT.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.156
- OH, HEADING BACK.
LOOKING FOR JEANNIE?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.291
- LOOK, SHE TURNED HIM DOWN
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE CASH.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.160
WE HAVE THREE BODIES,
NO MONEY IN THEIR WALLETS.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.428
HE'S FLUSH.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.096
- RASMUSSEN'S JOB,
IT WAS IN THE CITY?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.032
- WE HAVE PORT AUTHORITY
COVERED.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.800
PROTECTION FOR HIS SUPERVISOR,
CO-WORKERS,

12:46.834 --> 12:48.501
AND TWO EX-WIVES.
- ANY KIDS?

12:48.535 --> 12:50.904
- NO, NOT THAT WE'VE FOUND.
NO FRIENDS EITHER.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.973
CLOSEST FRIEND IS HIS BARTENDER.
- AND JEANNIE.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.108
HE'S KEPT IN TOUCH WITH HER
THROUGH THREE MARRIAGES.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.044
HE'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF A KILLING SPREE.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.578
SHE TURNS HIM DOWN.
HE LETS HER GO.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.580
- AND TAKES HIS ANGER OUT
ON THE STRANGERS NEXT DOOR.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.349
- MY TEAM WILL INTERROGATE,
ASCERTAIN IF HE SHARED

13:02.382 --> 13:03.583
ANY CONFIDENCES...
- AH.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.052
- OR IF HE TOLD HER
HIS DESTINATION.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.386
- HOLD ON.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

13:06.419 --> 13:08.021
I THINK THAT SHE WOULD BE
MORE COMFORTABLE

13:08.055 --> 13:09.389
IF WE TALKED TO HER.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.058
WE TALK TO SEX VICTIMS
EVERY DAY.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.092
- NO, SHE'S NOT A VICTIM.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.227
SHE'S A PROSTITUTE.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.096
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- IT'S FBI PROTOCOL.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.164
YOU HAVE YOURS.
WE HAVE OURS.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.966
- TAKE THAT ATTITUDE
IN THERE,

13:18.999 --> 13:20.968
I CAN PROMISE YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA SHUT HER DOWN.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.236
- LOOK, SHE WANTS OUT AS IT IS,
AND WE CAN'T HOLD HER.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.537
- SO ARREST HER.
- ARREST HER?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.339
WELL, FORGET ABOUT HER
COOPERATION.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.342
- AGENT CANTWELL, MY PEOPLE HAVE
A RAPPORT WITH HER.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.880
THEY'LL GET WHAT YOU NEED.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.048
- HEY. YOU CAN'T LIGHT UP
IN HERE.

13:35.082 --> 13:38.051
I CAN TAKE YOU FOR A WALK
LATER, OKAY?

13:38.085 --> 13:40.053
- LATER? I GOTTA GO.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.222
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.091
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY
I'M LOSING?

13:44.124 --> 13:45.492
- YOU GO BACK OUT THERE
AND CRAIG COMES AFTER YOU,

13:45.525 --> 13:47.094
WE CAN'T PROTECT YOU.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.129
- I BEEN TAKING CARE OF MYSELF
ON THE STREET

13:49.162 --> 13:51.999
FOR 25 YEARS, LONGER THAN YOU
BEEN AN ALTAR BOY, MIJO.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.300
I'M A SURVIVOR.
I CAN HANDLE CRAIG.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.068
- LIKE YOU DID 20 YEARS AGO,

13:55.102 --> 13:57.604
WHEN HE BROKE YOUR WRIST?
- YEAH, I REMEMBER THAT.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.007
WE HAD A FIGHT.
I WITHDREW THE COMPLAINT.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.608
AFTERWARD, HE CRIED
LIKE A LITTLE BOY.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.010
- YEAH, WELL, HE'S NOT
THE CRAIG YOU KNOW.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.012
HE SNAPPED.
- I THINK YOU GOT THE WRONG GUY.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.315
- JEANNIE, AFTER YOU LEFT
THE MOTEL ROOM,

14:08.348 --> 14:12.019
HE SHOT THREE MORE PEOPLE.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.286
- NO.
[gasps]

14:13.320 --> 14:15.622
NO!

14:15.655 --> 14:17.190
THIS IS YVETTE.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.026
- YOU KNOW HER?

14:19.059 --> 14:22.062
- YES, THIS IS YVETTE JIMENEZ.
SHE WAS JUST A BABY.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.034
THIS ISN'T MY FAULT.
YOU CAN'T PUT THIS ON ME.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.969
- WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT.
- I--

14:29.002 --> 14:31.471
HE CAN'T JUST OWE ME.
I CAN'T WORK THAT WAY.

14:31.504 --> 14:35.108
I GOT RENT TO PAY.
I GOT BILLS. I GOTTA GO.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.177
- HEY, LOOK,
WE THINK HE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.346
HE WAS LAST SEEN HEADED
BACK TO HUNTS POINT.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.148
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HAD JOHNS COME AFTER ME

14:41.181 --> 14:43.116
WITH RAZOR BLADES,
A TABLE LEG.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.352
I GO TO MASS EVERY DAY.
I PRAY.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.388
- YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE GOD PROTECTS YOU, BUT...

14:48.421 --> 14:50.057
WHAT ABOUT YVETTE, HMM?

14:50.090 --> 14:52.059
WHAT ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS
OUT AT HUNTS POINT?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.660
- HEY, MAN,
YOU TRYING TO GUILT ME?

14:53.693 --> 14:56.029
- NO, JEANNIE.
YOU MAY KNOW SOMETHING

14:56.063 --> 14:57.597
THAT WILL BE OF HELP,

14:57.630 --> 14:59.699
SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK
THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT, OKAY?

14:59.732 --> 15:02.069
WE'RE ASKING YOU
TO HELP US NOW.

15:02.102 --> 15:06.006
PLEASE.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.474

15:07.507 --> 15:09.676
WELL, IF I HELP YOU,
WHAT DO I GET OUT OF IT?

15:09.709 --> 15:11.344
- WE WILL WORK SOMETHING OUT.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.046
- WELL, I WANT DINNER,
RIGHT NOW.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.681
AND NOT SOME BOLOGNA SANDWICH.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.583
I WANT A STEAK.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.953
- WE CAN DO THAT.

I GOT YOU.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.434
- DOES HE ALWAYS DO
WHAT YOU TELL HIM TO?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.669
- IT'S NOT LIKE THAT, JEANNIE.
WE'RE PARTNERS.

15:36.703 --> 15:41.174
- YEAH. YOU'RE THE BOSS.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.143

15:50.217 --> 15:51.985
- I REMEMBER
WHERE I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.486
- I TOLD YOU.
IT WAS THE ASSAULT.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.155
- NO, NO, NO.
IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.091
PORT AUTHORITY, A RAPIST WAS
TARGETING WORKING GIRLS.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.994
MY FRIEND DARLA,
SHE GOT BEAT UP REAL BAD.

16:01.028 --> 16:05.498
SHE SAID YOU WERE NICE.

16:05.532 --> 16:09.102
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
JEANNIE.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.238
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN SEEING CRAIG?

16:11.271 --> 16:14.207
- OH, ENOUGH OF THE CHIT-CHAT?
[chuckles]

16:14.241 --> 16:17.610
OKAY, LET'S SEE.
UH, I'D JUST STARTED WORKING.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.148
MY BOYFRIEND LEFT ME.
I HAD A BABY TO FEED.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.616
CRAIG WAS ONE
OF MY FIRST DATES.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.653
IT WAS THE NIGHT THAT THE METS
WON THE WORLD SERIES.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.121
- '80...
- '86.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.090
YEAH, THOSE WERE GOOD TIMES.

16:30.123 --> 16:33.026
GUYS WERE FEELING LUCKY.
THEY WERE FEELING GENEROUS.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.328
- SO HE'S BEEN SEEING YOU LONGER
THAN ANY OF HIS WIVES.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.464
- HE WAS DIFFERENT
WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.732
HE WAS ANGRIER.
IT'S BETTER NOW.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.169
OR MAYBE YOU CAN JUST GET USED
TO ANYTHING.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.104
THAT'S WHAT SOME COUNSELOR
TOLD ME.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.539
- COUNSELOR?
- COURT-ORDERED THERAPY.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.675
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.543
NOTHING I DIDN'T KNOW
ALREADY ANYWAY.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.345
- JEANNIE.

16:52.379 --> 16:56.049
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
THE RIGHT COUNSELOR.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.685
- I DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE
PAY FOR THAT ANYWAY.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.253
JUST COME ON, GUYS.
GET A DOG.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.688
- I KNOW PEOPLE

17:01.721 --> 17:03.156
PEOPLE THAT AREN'T GONNA
JUDGE YOU.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.657
THEY WON'T CHARGE YOU.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.226
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP
DOING THIS.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.561
[cell phone beeps]

17:08.595 --> 17:10.630
- PICK IT UP.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.399
[beeping continues]

17:12.432 --> 17:14.067
- BUT I-I DON'T RECOGNIZE
THIS NUMBER.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.136
- ANSWER IT, JEANNIE.
- WHO ARE YOU?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.404
- AGENT CANTWELL IS
FROM THE FBI.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.106
- WE GOT A TRACE
ON YOUR PHONE.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.074
KEEP HIM TALKING.
- WHAT DO I SAY?

17:21.108 --> 17:23.176
- DO NOT TELL HIM THAT YOU'VE
SEEN THE NEWS,

17:23.210 --> 17:25.078
AND DO NOT TELL HIM
YOU'RE WITH THE POLICE.

17:25.112 --> 17:27.214
- HE AIN'T STUPID.
- AND NEITHER ARE YOU, JEANNIE.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.415
- DETECTIVE.
- GO AHEAD.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.118
- SHH. HELLO?

17:31.151 --> 17:32.852
HEY, BABY.

I'M SORRY TOO, BABY.
I'M SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.732
- W-WHERE ARE YOU?
I NEED TO SEE YOU.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.101
- I WANT TO SEE YOU.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.137
NO, HONEY,
I DIDN'T TURN ON THE TV.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.871
I BEEN WORKING.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.474
- MY HEAD'S POUNDING.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.742
I GOTTA GO.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.177
- OH, WAIT, HONEY.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.845

29:03.409 --> 29:05.077
HEY, YOU WANT A DATE?

29:05.111 --> 29:08.915
- NOT A CHANCE.
[engine revs]

29:08.948 --> 29:11.150
[cell phone beeping]

29:14.286 --> 29:18.157
HEY, BABY.
- YOU WORKING TONIGHT?

29:18.190 --> 29:20.126
- UH, I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.228
YEAH, I'M WORKING.

29:22.261 --> 29:25.097
- I GOT MONEY NOW.
YOU OWE ME.

29:25.131 --> 29:28.500
- WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I'M HERE.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.136
[breathing heavily]

29:30.169 --> 29:31.470
DID YOU GET THAT?

29:31.503 --> 29:34.506
THAT WAS HIM.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.315
[indistinct chatter
in background]

29:43.349 --> 29:46.919
IN A BLACK TOWN CAR.

29:46.953 --> 29:50.589
[car approaches]

29:50.622 --> 29:52.959
- ALL RIGHT,
WELL, THAT'S NOT HIM.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.227
HEY, YOU WANNA PARTY?

29:55.261 --> 29:57.329
- GET IN.
- [laughs]

29:57.363 --> 30:00.132
OKAY, JUST ONE SECOND, OKAY?

30:00.166 --> 30:04.103
- GET IN. NOW.
- OKAY, OKAY.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.038
- IT'S HIM.
WE GOT HIM.

30:06.072 --> 30:09.976
WHITE NISSAN ALTIMA,
CORNER OF EAST BAY AND FAILE.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.178
DO NOT SHOOT.
SHE'S IN THE CAR.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.146
- OKAY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
THIS WAY.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.283
- SHUT UP.
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.118
EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS
TELLING ME THE--

30:19.151 --> 30:21.220
[sirens wailing]

30:21.253 --> 30:24.190
[suspenseful music]

30:24.223 --> 30:31.864
*

30:31.898 --> 30:32.899
[police radio chatter]

30:32.932 --> 30:34.233
- DON'T SHOOT!

30:34.266 --> 30:36.202
HE'S GOT SOMEONE IN THE CAR!

30:36.235 --> 30:37.569
- PUT THE GUN DOWN!
HANDS UP!

30:37.603 --> 30:39.271
- HE'S GOT A CIVILIAN
IN THE CAR!

30:39.305 --> 30:42.141
- DO NOT SHOOT!
- I--

30:42.174 --> 30:44.410
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

30:44.443 --> 30:47.546
SHE WOULDN'T SHUT UP.

30:47.579 --> 30:51.317
I JUST WANTED
THE BOTH OF THEM...

30:51.350 --> 30:55.554
TO STOP YELLING.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.258
LIKE YOU.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.528
YOU KNOW WHEN TO BE QUIET.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.965
IF SHE JUST
WOULD'VE SHUT UP...

31:05.998 --> 31:07.199
I NEVER WOULD'VE DONE IT.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.300
- PUT THE GUN DOWN.

31:08.334 --> 31:11.904
- YEAH.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.239
- EVERYBODY JUST NEEDS
TO SHUT UP--

31:13.272 --> 31:14.573
[gunshot]
UNH!

31:14.606 --> 31:20.246
- [gasps]
- SUSPECT DOWN, MOVE IN!

31:20.279 --> 31:22.248
- [gasping]

31:22.281 --> 31:23.549
[screams]

31:23.582 --> 31:25.651
- HEY. IT'S OKAY.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.020
- [stammering]
- I GOT YOU.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.288
I GOT YOU.

31:29.321 --> 31:32.258
- [stammering]
- I GOT YOU.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.501
- HOW YOU FEELING?

31:42.534 --> 31:45.004
- I'M GONNA BE OKAY.

31:45.037 --> 31:47.473
- I STOPPED BY THE DINER
TO GET YOUR COAT,

31:47.506 --> 31:50.176
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT YOU LIKE
FRENCH ONION SOUP.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.643
- STILL DON'T FEEL LIKE
EATING ANYTHING.

31:51.677 --> 31:55.014
- JEANNIE, YOU CAN'T FAST
FOR FIVE DAYS.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.716
- OH, YOU HEARD THAT TOO?
GREAT.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.185
YOU KNOW WHAT?
[sighs]

31:59.218 --> 32:01.320
I'M GONNA ASK THE PRIEST
TO PRAY FOR CRAIG.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.155
YOU KNOW,
HE REALLY WASN'T SO BAD.

32:03.189 --> 32:06.658
IF THEY HADN'T SHOT HIM,
I THINK I COULD'VE TALKED HIM

32:06.692 --> 32:09.095
INTO GIVING HIMSELF UP.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.230
- YEAH, MAYBE.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.199
- WE ALWAYS GOT ALONG OKAY.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.101
- NOT ALWAYS, JEANNIE.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.469
HE BEAT YOU, REMEMBER?

32:17.503 --> 32:20.039
- YEAH, THAT WAS MY FAULT.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.208
HE WAS IN A BAD MOOD.
I SHOULD'VE SEEN IT COMING.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.476
YOU KNOW, I WENT
TO HAIRDRESSING SCHOOL,

32:24.510 --> 32:26.178
THE WILFRED ACADEMY.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.713
I KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE CHATTER
GOING--KEEP IT UPBEAT.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.248
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS,

32:29.281 --> 32:30.516
YOUR BITCHING.

32:30.549 --> 32:31.984
THEY GET ENOUGH OF THAT
AT HOME.

32:32.018 --> 32:33.352
- I TALKED TO CANTWELL.

32:33.385 --> 32:36.522
- WAIT, IS THIS
ABOUT MY REWARD MONEY?

32:36.555 --> 32:38.657
- YEAH.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.393
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.
THERE WAS NO REWARD POSTED.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.995
CAPTAIN SAYS WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO COME UP

32:43.029 --> 32:44.997
WITH AN EXTRA
FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.299
- ARE YOU--
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

32:47.333 --> 32:49.368
A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.570
I GOT IN THE CAR WITH HIM!

32:51.603 --> 32:53.472
I GOT HIS BRAINS
BLOWN ALL OVER ME.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.042
- JEANNIE, WHAT YOU DID
WAS HEROIC.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.143
- THE PRESS WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.011
- NO.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.546
MY SON DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING,

33:00.579 --> 33:03.715
AND HE AIN'T GONNA.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.651
- WE'RE SORRY
ABOUT THE REWARD MONEY.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.220
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

33:08.254 --> 33:09.588
THAT WE CAN HELP YOU.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.357
- OH, LIKE WHAT?
- COUNSELING.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.692
REHAB. WE CAN GET YOU
OFF THE STREET.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.027
- WHAT ELSE AM I GONNA DO?

33:15.061 --> 33:16.595
WHAT AM I GONNA WRITE
ON MY RESUME?

33:16.628 --> 33:18.364
WHORE?

33:18.397 --> 33:20.266
- YOU JUST SAID
THAT YOU STUDIED HAIRDRESSING.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.801
OKAY? SO MAYBE WE CAN MAKE
SOME CALLS.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.803
- I DIDN'T GRADUATE.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.106
- OKAY, WELL, SO WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

33:27.139 --> 33:30.309
BUT, JEANNIE, YOU JUST HAD
A VERY CLOSE CALL.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.543
YOU ALMOST DIED.

33:31.577 --> 33:34.813
- THANKS TO YOU.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.316
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.051
YOU'VE BEEN OUT ON THE STREET
LONG ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT?

33:39.085 --> 33:40.819
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO COME INSIDE.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.555
- YOU KNOW WHAT, PAPI?
OH, I LIKE MY JOB, OKAY?

33:43.589 --> 33:45.291
I'M MY OWN BOSS.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.359
I GET TO MAKE MY OWN HOURS.

33:47.393 --> 33:48.794
- STOP. ENOUGH.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.562
YOU CAN'T DO THIS
FOREVER, JEANNIE.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.531
- YOU BEEN DOING YOUR JOB
AS LONG AS I HAVE.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.466
WHAT DO YOU GOT
TO SHOW FOR IT, HUH?

33:54.500 --> 33:55.734
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU OFFERING ME?

33:55.767 --> 33:58.137
SOME LOUSY REHAB?
NO, THANK YOU.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.539
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:00.572 --> 34:02.841
YOU CAN TAKE THIS BACK.
I WANT MY REAL ONE.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.078
IT PROTECTS ME MORE.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.616
- CONGRATULATIONS.

34:10.649 --> 34:12.218
NICE WORK.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.486
MY BOSSES ARE TAKING CREDIT
FOR RASMUSSEN RIGHT NOW.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.623
AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT EMAILING
SHIRTLESS PHOTOS.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.225
- OKAY, BUT THE REASON
WE GOT RASMUSSEN

34:19.258 --> 34:20.459
WAS BECAUSE OF JEANNIE.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.827
- YEAH, AND THERE'S THAT.

34:21.860 --> 34:25.097
- WELL, NOBODY AT THE FBI
LIKES THE ANGLE

34:25.131 --> 34:26.598
THAT WE USED A STREET HOOKER
TO GET THIS GUY.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.834
- SO WHAT?
WE JUST FORGET ABOUT HER?

34:28.867 --> 34:30.469
WE USED HER.
NOW WE THROW HER AWAY.

34:30.502 --> 34:33.205
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT
FROM HER JOHNS?

34:33.239 --> 34:34.873
- LIV, SHE'S ON THE STREET
25 YEARS.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.708
- IT'S TOO LATE.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.745
IT'S TOUGH,
BUT SHE'S MADE HER CHOICES.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.749
- WE CAN GET HER TREATMENT.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.418
P.T.S.D.,
GO AT IT THAT WAY.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.188
- SHE'S BEEN WORKING IT LONGER
THAN WE'VE BEEN ON THE JOB.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.689
SHE'S NOT GONNA QUIT NOW.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.858
- SO NOW WE JUST LEAVE HER
OUT THERE TO DIE?

34:52.891 --> 34:55.794
- WE CAN BOOK HER.
GET HER OFF THE STREET.

34:55.827 --> 34:59.165
WE HEARD HER ON THE WIRE
COMMITTING PROSTITUTION.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.799
- D.A.'S NOT GONNA GO
FOR THAT.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.701
SHE WAS WORKING FOR US
AT THE TIME.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.370
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WE PLAY HARD BALL.

35:04.403 --> 35:05.737
SEARCH HER.
YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S HOLDING?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.806
GET THE D.A.
TO THROW THE BOOK--

35:07.839 --> 35:09.441
- UNLESS SHE AGREES
TO GO TO REHAB.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.809
- YOU SAID SHE HAS FAMILY.

35:10.842 --> 35:14.146
- YEAH, BUT HER DAUGHTER
WON'T EVEN TALK TO HER.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.418
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL MAKE THE CALL.
GO PICK HER UP.

35:24.723 --> 35:28.427
[knock at door]

35:28.460 --> 35:32.898
- YEAH?

35:32.931 --> 35:34.400
UGH. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:34.433 --> 35:35.701
- WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR YOUR ARREST.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.703
- WHY? I ASKED
FOR MY REWARD MONEY?

35:37.736 --> 35:39.405
THIS IS A BUNCHA CRAP.
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

35:39.438 --> 35:41.440
- YOU'RE NOT WORKING
TONIGHT, JEANNIE.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.343
- WHAT? WHY?
I'M GONNA SUE YOU.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.578
I'M GONNA SUE ALL OF YOU.
NYPD, FBI.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.514
I ALMOST GOT KILLED
LAST NIGHT.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.449
- AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE
THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.719
- COME ON.
- [sighs]

35:53.752 --> 35:55.187
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT EATING,

35:55.221 --> 35:56.588
BUT CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?

35:56.622 --> 35:59.391
- NO. THREE DAYS,
I'LL BE ABSOLVED.

35:59.425 --> 36:02.428
- ALL RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU HANG ON TO THIS?

36:10.902 --> 36:12.604
- I JUST SPOKE TO THE D.A.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.974
HE SAID, AND I QUOTE,
"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"

36:16.007 --> 36:17.876
THEY'RE GONNA RECOMMEND
TIME SERVED.

36:17.909 --> 36:21.447
- NO, WE FOUND COCAINE
IN HER PURSE, ALL RIGHT?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.748
ILLEGAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS--

36:22.781 --> 36:25.251
- HE TOOK ONE LOOK
AT HER RAP SHEET AND SAID

36:25.284 --> 36:26.985
THERE WAS NO UPSIDE TO PUSHING
HER THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.620
- WE DON'T HAVE
TO TELL HER THAT.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.323
- LIV, SEND HER
DOWN TO ARRAIGNMENT.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.724
- CAPTAIN, IT'S LATE.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.626
I MEAN, CAN'T WE JUST KEEP HER
TILL MORNING?

36:34.660 --> 36:36.662
- YOU REALLY THINK ONE NIGHT'S
GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

36:36.695 --> 36:39.465
- MAYBE.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.501
- ONE NIGHT.

36:47.639 --> 36:49.708
- RISE AND SHINE, JEANNIE.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.310
- SCREW YOU.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.811
- LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT EATING,

36:52.844 --> 36:54.380
BUT WHY DON'T YOU AT LEAST TAKE
THE COFFEE?

36:54.413 --> 36:55.781
- WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?

36:55.814 --> 36:57.483
I SHOULD'VE BEEN R.O.R.'D
LAST NIGHT.

36:57.516 --> 36:59.851
- PAPERWORK.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.854
- [coughs]
- FOLLOW ME.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.764
- OH, MA!
WHAT THE HELL?

37:12.798 --> 37:14.733
[breathing heavily]

37:14.766 --> 37:16.902
I'M SORRY, FATHER.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.003
I-I HAVEN'T EATEN
IN TWO DAYS.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.871
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

37:19.905 --> 37:22.474
- I DRANK SOME COFFEE,
AND I HAD SOME VODKA.

37:22.508 --> 37:23.675
- AH, JEANNIE.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.744
- WITH A LITTLE
ORANGE JUICE, MA.

37:25.777 --> 37:27.379
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

37:27.413 --> 37:29.881
- UNLESS THE D.A. SEES
THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE

37:29.915 --> 37:33.785
IN YOUR CORNER WHO ARE WILLING
TO HELP YOU,

37:33.819 --> 37:34.820
YOU'RE GOING AWAY, JEANNIE.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.455
- FINE.

37:36.488 --> 37:40.459
MA, TELL 'EM
YOU'RE IN MY CORNER.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.828
- NO. I'M NOT.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.830
- EXCUSE ME?
- IRENE.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.798
TELL YOUR DAUGHTER
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.468
- I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

37:49.501 --> 37:52.971
EVERY NIGHT, I PRAY THAT YOU'LL
SURVIVE OUT THERE.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.706
I DON'T SLEEP.

37:54.740 --> 37:57.309
- HEY.
WHAT IS THIS, HUH?

37:57.343 --> 37:59.345
IS THIS SOME KIND OF HALF-ASS
INTERVENTION?

37:59.378 --> 38:01.413
HAVEN'T YOU CAUSED
ENOUGH TROUBLE?

38:01.447 --> 38:03.415
I WANT MY ARRAIGNMENT!

38:03.449 --> 38:06.352
- JEANNIE, YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

38:09.588 --> 38:12.691
- NO. I WON'T DO IT.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.726
SHE'S A DRUNK.
SHE'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.828
- THIS IS YOUR MOTHER.
SHE NEEDS YOU.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.797
- I WASHED MY HANDS OF HER
A LONG TIME AGO.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.732
THE DRUGS, THE LYING.

38:20.766 --> 38:23.001
SHE'S A PROSTITUTE,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.536
- THAT WAS TO PUT FOOD
ON THE TABLE

38:24.570 --> 38:25.904
AND A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.739
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

38:27.773 --> 38:30.108
- 27.
- EVER DO THE MATH?

38:30.141 --> 38:32.811
YOUR MOTHER'S FIRST ARREST
WAS 26 YEARS AGO.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.447
THAT'S WHEN YOUR FATHER
WALKED OUT ON YOU GUYS,

38:35.481 --> 38:36.848
LEFT HER TO RAISE YOU.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.551
AND SHE DID THE BEST
SHE COULD.

38:39.585 --> 38:40.952
YOU HAD A COMFORTABLE LIFE
GROWING UP.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.921
YOU WENT TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.456
WHO YOU THINK PAID
FOR THAT?

38:44.490 --> 38:46.057
- IT WON'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.394
- LISTEN.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.529
LEAST YOU COULD SAY
YOU TRIED.

38:50.562 --> 38:53.565
THIS IS HER LAST CHANCE.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.738
[hydraulics hiss]

39:04.142 --> 39:05.744
- I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.112
I BEEN DOING IT
MY WHOLE LIFE.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.448
- YEAH? IS THAT WHY
ALL THE NURSES AT THE E.R.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.116
KNEW YOU BY YOUR FIRST NAME?

39:11.149 --> 39:12.884
- HEY.
- JEANNIE, YOU'VE BEEN

39:12.918 --> 39:15.587
HOSPITALIZED
DOZENS OF TIMES.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.789
YOU HAD TWO CONCUSSIONS.
- STOP IT.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.124
- YOU GOT YOUR TEETH
KNOCKED OUT.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.592
YOU HAD THREE STAB WOUNDS,
STDs.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.093
- OH, MY GOD.

39:22.127 --> 39:23.962
- SHE DOESN'T NEED TO HEAR--

39:23.995 --> 39:27.766
MOM.

39:27.799 --> 39:31.870
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:31.903 --> 39:34.706
- I WANT YOU
TO GET HELP, MOM.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.074
- YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

39:36.107 --> 39:39.110
- TALK TO YOUR MOTHER,
ANGELA.

39:45.884 --> 39:49.755
- I KNOW
I'VE TREATED YOU BAD.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.857
I'M SORRY.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.092
BUT WE CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THIS.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.428
WE GOTTA CHANGE, MA.

39:56.462 --> 39:59.665
I DO. YOU DO.
ALL OF US.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.966
- I THINK IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.102
- NO. YOU CAN START OVER
RIGHT NOW, JEANNIE.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.905
- YOU'VE HAD ALL THE WEIGHT
ON YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.140
I CAN CARRY SOME NOW.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.543
- NO, SWEETHEART.
I'M SORRY. YOU CAN'T.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.078
YOU GOT A BABY
TO TAKE CARE OF.

40:13.111 --> 40:14.946
- MA, REBECCA'S FINE.
LET'S WORRY ABOUT YOU NOW.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.916
- NO, LET'S NOT WORRY
ABOUT ME, OKAY?

40:17.949 --> 40:20.819
I'M A GROWNUP.
EVERYONE BACK OFF ALREADY!

40:20.852 --> 40:22.854
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!

40:22.888 --> 40:25.023
- MA.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.992
- NO. NO.
JOHNNY--

40:27.025 --> 40:28.727
HE CANNOT BE HERE.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.996
YOU GOTTA GO, HONEY!
- I-I KNOW, MA.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.499
- NO, YOU CAN'T BE HERE.
- I KNOW WHAT YOU DO.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.866
I'VE KNOWN
FOR A LONG TIME.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.169
- WHAT?

40:38.203 --> 40:39.738
DID YOUR SISTER TELL YOU?

40:39.771 --> 40:41.206
- NO, MA, I SWEAR.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.509
- SHE DIDN'T.

40:43.542 --> 40:44.843
IT WAS THE KIDS AT SCHOOL.

40:44.876 --> 40:46.111
I SAID THEY WERE ALL LIARS.

40:46.144 --> 40:47.579
THEN ONE NIGHT,
I FOLLOWED YOU.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.915
- OH, GOD.
OH, GOD.

40:49.948 --> 40:53.218
- IT'S OKAY, MA.
LOOK AT ME.

40:53.251 --> 40:55.253
- [sobs]
- YOU'VE DONE FOR US

40:55.286 --> 40:56.722
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

40:56.755 --> 41:00.191
YOU STOP NOW.
IT'S OUR TURN.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.860
- PLEASE, JEANNIE,
YOU CAN DO THIS.

41:01.893 --> 41:06.632
- MA, I WANT REBECCA
TO HAVE A GRANDMOTHER.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.668
AND I NEED YOU, MOM.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.139
- [exhales sharply]

41:17.208 --> 41:20.478
OH.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.016
OH.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.819
OH. OKAY.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.856
OKAY. I'LL TRY.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.791
OH.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.827
[sniffles]
OKAY.

41:38.897 --> 41:42.768
YOU HAPPY NOW?

41:42.801 --> 41:44.570
[sighs]

41:44.603 --> 41:45.904
YOU GOT A PLACE FOR ME?

41:45.937 --> 41:48.273
- I DO, JEANNIE.
I DO.

41:48.306 --> 41:50.175
- ARE THEY GONNA LET ME SMOKE?

41:50.208 --> 41:51.810
- UH, YOU CAN ASK,

41:51.843 --> 41:56.114
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.750
- YEAH. WHAT IS?
