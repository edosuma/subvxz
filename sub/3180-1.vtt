00:53.600 --> 00:57.540
I accept this honor for our lost ones,

00:57.640 --> 01:00.266
whose deaths pave our path.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.379
And for the 20 million
Negro men and women

01:04.480 --> 01:09.268
motivated by dignity
and a disdain for hopelessness.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.220
This isn't right.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.501
Corrie.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.020
This ain't right.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.426
What's that?

01:20.040 --> 01:22.586
This necktie. It's not right.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.740
Well, it's not a necktie, dear.
It's an ascot.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.990
Yes, but generally the same principles
should apply, shouldn't they?

01:31.760 --> 01:33.624
It's not right.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.789
It's not right, or you don't like it?

01:36.840 --> 01:38.900
I don't like how this looks.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.540
Looks distinguished and debonair to me.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.100
You know what I mean.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.180
Like we're living high on the hog.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.226
Dressed like this
while folks back home are...

01:52.200 --> 01:54.143
It's not right.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.340
Wait till the brothers back home
see me like this.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.780
They'll have a good laugh.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.140
Let them laugh.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.390
It's not a crime to be away
for a few days, Martin.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.146
It's nice being away, huh?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.345
Yeah. It really is.

02:15.840 --> 02:16.941
Look here.

02:18.760 --> 02:22.148
I'm gonna be a pastor somewhere small.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.265
College town.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.070
Lead a little church. Teach a class.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.988
Maybe the occasional
speaking engagement.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.380
And I'll pay all the bills for us,

02:39.480 --> 02:42.789
especially the mortgage
for our very own house.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.790
Perfect.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.824
You look handsome.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.900
Through it all,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.231
Martin Luther King has
spoken of his dream.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.380
One which we

03:11.480 --> 03:15.869
and many other people
around the world share.

03:17.200 --> 03:22.420
To this undeterred hero for justice,

03:22.520 --> 03:26.060
the Nobel Committee of Oslo, Norway,

03:26.160 --> 03:31.710
awards our 1964 Peace Prize.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.780
I accept this honor for our lost ones,

03:50.880 --> 03:55.020
whose deaths pave our path.

03:55.120 --> 04:00.260
I accept this honor for the more than
20 million American Negroes

04:00.360 --> 04:03.380
who are motivated by dignity.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.060
Together we believe that
what the illusion

04:07.160 --> 04:09.581
of supremacy has destroyed,

04:09.920 --> 04:14.060
the truth of equality can nourish.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.540
I promise you.
It ain't nothing to be scared of.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.700
It's quick. And the pastor
is right there next to you.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.260
Yeah, but the biggest thing
is getting your hair wet up.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.740
I got my hair pressed that same morning

04:22.840 --> 04:24.900
and it was wasted
as soon as I hit the water.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.023
I should have worn a swim cap
like Mama said.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.220
See, I asked my mama

04:29.320 --> 04:31.780
could she make my hair like
Coretta Scott King had hers

04:31.880 --> 04:33.420
at the Washington March.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.140
But she said that was too grown.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.580
Oh, I love her hair.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.340
I heard she don't even put rollers in it.
It's just like that.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.740
But I studied it. I know how she do it.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.102
See, she parts in the middle and then...

06:41.680 --> 06:42.781
Annie Lee Cooper!

06:47.160 --> 06:50.787
Get on up now. I ain't got all day.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.741
You work for Mr. Dunn
down at the rest home, ain't that right?

07:10.320 --> 07:11.626
Yes.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.820
Wonder what old Dunn'll say
when I tell him

07:13.920 --> 07:16.780
one of his gals is down here
stirring a fuss.

07:16.880 --> 07:21.349
I ain't stirring no fuss.
I'm just here trying to register to vote.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.780
It's all right this time.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.869
It's right when I say it's right.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.701
Recite the Constitution's preamble.
Know what a preamble is?

07:44.720 --> 07:48.950
"We the people of the United States,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.751
"in order to form a more perfect union,

07:54.400 --> 07:57.106
"establish justice,

07:57.720 --> 08:00.585
"ensure domestic tranquility,

08:01.240 --> 08:05.340
"provide for the common defense,
promote the general welfare..."

08:05.440 --> 08:08.384
How many county judges in Alabama?

08:12.880 --> 08:14.630
Sixty-seven.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.510
Name them.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.700
Aren't we done?
Are we not done with this?

08:50.800 --> 08:53.020
- Will this ever end?
- I don't know, Mr. President.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.140
A comprehensive plan
is already in place.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.860
The act was only passed six months ago.

08:57.960 --> 09:01.900
So hammer home that
impatience only hurts the overall cause.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.380
We're... We're getting there.
Just... Just keep reiterating the plan.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.740
No, he doesn't want reiteration.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.420
He wants something so he can say,
"Look, I told you I had a dream

09:10.520 --> 09:12.860
"and it's all coming goddamn true,
whether you like it or not!"

09:12.960 --> 09:14.580
That's what he wants.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.980
What he needs to do
is get on board with what we're doing

09:17.080 --> 09:19.342
instead of the other way around.
For once!

09:21.120 --> 09:23.740
Mr. President, Dr. King.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.420
Mr. President.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.270
Dr. King.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.860
Well, I'll tell you.
I'm a tall son-of-a-bitch,

09:30.960 --> 09:34.260
but this close to the new Nobel laureate

09:34.360 --> 09:36.740
and with all those other trinkets
you've been collecting lately,

09:36.840 --> 09:38.749
I feel tits-high to a puppy dog.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.830
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

09:41.720 --> 09:42.700
Mr. White.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.060
- Dr. King.
- All right.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.580
I'll tell you, ending segregation,

09:47.680 --> 09:51.102
proudest moment of my life
when I signed that '64 Act.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.700
Proudest moment of my life, I tell you.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.620
Now civil rights is a priority

09:56.720 --> 09:58.740
- of this administration as you know.
- Thank you.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.060
We're gonna face the challenge,

10:00.160 --> 10:03.460
or this country is
storing up a heap of trouble for itself.

10:03.560 --> 10:07.580
Now, seeing as I can't convince you to
work with my administration

10:07.680 --> 10:11.262
in an official capacity
inside the White House,

10:11.400 --> 10:12.620
I feel damn fortunate

10:12.720 --> 10:14.380
to have someone as statesmanlike as you

10:14.480 --> 10:15.460
leading the movement.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.420
And I want you to go on leading it.
No one else.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.669
Not one of these
militant Malcolm X types.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.747
So... I wanna help. Tell me how.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.460
Well, Mr. President,

10:29.560 --> 10:33.420
I'm here to speak
specifically about the denial

10:33.520 --> 10:36.988
of a basic American right
for the Negro citizen.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.349
The right to vote.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.500
Well... Technically...

10:43.600 --> 10:47.460
Technically, we already have it.
Yes, Mr. President.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.660
But, we both know in the South

10:50.760 --> 10:54.460
black voters are kept off the rolls
and out of the voting booths

10:54.560 --> 10:59.188
by systematic intimidation
and fear, Mr. President.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.464
Now, you asked how you can help.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.580
We want Federal legislation

11:06.680 --> 11:10.500
granting Negroes the right
to vote unencumbered.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.020
And we want Federal protocol eliminating

11:14.120 --> 11:16.660
the decades-long dismissal

11:16.760 --> 11:20.140
and illegal denial
of blacks seeking to vote.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.140
And we want
robust enforcement of that protocol.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.020
Well... That's fine.

11:30.120 --> 11:34.900
But... Most of the South
is still not desegregating.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.706
Let's not start another battle
when we haven't even won the first.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.580
And you know what
the next battle should be?

11:42.680 --> 11:45.260
The eradication of poverty.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.783
I'm calling it "The War on Poverty."

11:49.440 --> 11:52.660
It's a matter of political priorities.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.910
Poverty is going to be my focus at home
and I want you to help me with this.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.820
We can make big changes in these things

11:59.920 --> 12:01.540
for people of all colors.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.940
And I know that matters to you,
doesn't it?

12:04.040 --> 12:06.381
This voting thing
is just gonna have to wait.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.380
It...

12:14.480 --> 12:17.580
It can't wait, Mr. President.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.700
Well, why not?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.900
Because there have been thousands

12:21.000 --> 12:23.380
of racially motivated murders
in the South,

12:23.480 --> 12:25.900
including those four girls.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.060
Well, I know that...

12:27.160 --> 12:29.740
And you know the astounding fact

12:29.840 --> 12:34.700
that not one of these criminals
who murder us when and why they want

12:34.800 --> 12:36.420
has ever been convicted.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.180
Yeah, I know we have a lot
of work to do down there.

12:38.280 --> 12:43.020
Not one conviction because they
are protected by white officials

12:43.120 --> 12:45.620
chosen by an all-white electorate.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.540
And on the rare occasions
that they face trial,

12:48.640 --> 12:51.620
they are freed by all-white juries.

12:51.720 --> 12:56.780
All-white because
you can't serve on a jury

12:56.880 --> 12:59.460
unless you are registered to vote.

13:02.920 --> 13:07.180
Well, Dr. King, you've certainly given me
something to think about.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.940
But this administration is going to
set this aside for a while.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.507
Just for a while, you understand.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.787
Yes, Mr. President, I... I understand.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.264
Selma it is.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.824
Big speech lined up
for these folks tonight, Doc?

13:50.760 --> 13:53.466
We need to see what's what first,
Big Fellow.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.820
We're just here to test the waters.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.388
Oh, my Lord.
What you got us into, woman?

13:59.760 --> 14:05.660
We've got 128 miles
to come to our senses, gentlemen.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.980
Hush.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.780
This here is the place we need to be.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.631
This right here
is the next great battle.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.468
I can only imagine.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.789
Decent-looking place to die though.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.981
Ms. Nash.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.460
Mr. Bevel.

14:49.560 --> 14:53.949
Doc? This here is it. Selma's the place.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.060
A lot of groundwork has already
been laid by the people here.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.261
And they ready.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.741
- Sister Boynton.
- Mr. Orange.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.271
Good afternoon.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.948
Dr. King?

15:37.440 --> 15:39.941
May I introduce myself?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.269
Yeah, of course.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.507
Hey!

15:48.960 --> 15:50.471
It's okay. It's okay. I'm okay.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.586
This way, Dr. King.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.700
That white boy can hit.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.100
This place is perfect.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.782
What's the FBI's current information
on Martin Luther King?

16:07.240 --> 16:09.620
I heard he was assaulted in Selma.

16:09.720 --> 16:13.620
My information can be
summed up in a few words.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.820
King is a political
and moral degenerate.

16:17.920 --> 16:21.620
Well, you say that, J. Edgar.
I have to take it seriously.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.900
But if he's a degenerate,
what I do know is,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.140
he's a non-violent degenerate.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.140
And I want him to go on leading
the civil rights movement,

16:30.240 --> 16:33.220
not one of these bloodthirsty militants.

16:33.320 --> 16:37.345
What I need to know right now is
what's he about to do next?

16:38.240 --> 16:39.671
Mr. President,

16:40.720 --> 16:45.140
you know we can shut men with power down

16:45.240 --> 16:49.265
permanently and unequivocally.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.829
I'm very aware of that, Mr. Director.

16:59.640 --> 17:04.951
Well, if you prefer
a different approach,

17:06.760 --> 17:08.544
we can go with the wife.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.710
We know there's tension
in the home already.

17:17.280 --> 17:20.906
We can weaken the dynamic.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.464
Dismantle the family.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.780
Hello.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.948
You ain't got long.

17:59.200 --> 18:03.589
When the hearts of those Pickaninnies
of yours stop beating...

18:07.440 --> 18:09.429
Same thing?

18:12.320 --> 18:13.660
When are you all heading out?

18:15.000 --> 18:18.820
We're heading back to Selma at 5:00 a.m.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.229
It turned out to be
an ideal staging ground.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.308
There's a full couple of weeks planned.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.270
Quite a bit to be done.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.985
I see.

18:42.360 --> 18:46.670
That highway is nice now.
Get you there in a couple of hours.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.231
Good people in those parts though.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.706
Well...

19:09.280 --> 19:12.065
I'm worried about the ones
who ain't so good.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.027
This local Sheriff Jim Clark
is supposed to be bad business.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.662
Won't go down without a fight, they say.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.711
And since we don't fight...

19:28.080 --> 19:29.705
Well...

19:30.520 --> 19:33.351
As good a place to die as any, I guess.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.748
I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.462
It just takes the edge off.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.540
You and your friends
can joke about that.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.868
I don't joke about that.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.664
You're right. I'm sorry.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.260
I'll put these things away
in your bag now.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.509
I didn't realize
you were leaving so early.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.940
Hello?

20:56.040 --> 20:57.266
Halie?

20:57.960 --> 20:59.710
Martin.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.186
I need to hear the Lord's voice.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.146
Surely, Martin. Surely.

21:21.840 --> 21:28.789
Precious Lord

21:29.720 --> 21:34.303
Take my hand

21:35.680 --> 21:42.345
Lead me home

21:42.880 --> 21:47.861
Let me stand

21:48.240 --> 21:55.189
I am tired

21:56.800 --> 22:01.542
I am weak

22:02.600 --> 22:09.663
I am worn

22:12.680 --> 22:19.425
Through the storm

22:19.920 --> 22:27.029
Through the night

22:29.800 --> 22:36.784
Lord, lead me on

22:37.200 --> 22:39.621
To the light

22:42.240 --> 22:43.980
- Hey!
- Hey!

22:44.080 --> 22:45.670
- Sully.
- Look at you.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.020
- Morning, Doctor.
- Good morning, Doctor.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.700
- Drive all right?
- Good and long.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.700
Good news is Richie Jean is in there.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.301
Oh, she's ready for you.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.420
Negro, that's all you had to say.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.300
Uncle Marty!

23:03.400 --> 23:05.741
There she is! There's our girl!

23:06.440 --> 23:08.861
Hey, Richie Jean!

23:10.480 --> 23:12.260
- Looking like her mom.
- You go play.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.986
- Hey!
- Hey, Ralphy.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.580
- How you doing?
- Hey!

23:17.680 --> 23:18.700
Good to see you, sweetheart.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.390
Hey, come over here.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.460
Oh, Lord, it's good to see this!

23:23.560 --> 23:25.620
Okay, now, I've got the grits
on the stove.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.700
How many we expecting today?

23:27.800 --> 23:30.020
Well, now, Sister Jackson.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.700
You know about our group,
the SCLC, right?

23:32.800 --> 23:34.740
The Southern Christian
Leadership Conference?

23:34.840 --> 23:37.260
A few of our top SCLC leaders
are with us this time

23:37.360 --> 23:40.907
since we're going to be here
a little longer than expected.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.860
Now, this here's Reverend C.T. Vivian.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.660
He coordinates all the SCLC branches.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.420
Welcome. Nice to meet you.
Welcome, welcome.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.340
This is Reverend James Bevel.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.460
- How you doing, ma'am?
- I'm well. Thank you.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.100
This here is James Orange.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.580
Oh, this is a big one.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.140
I don't know if I've got enough
to feed you.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.700
Well, let's find out. How about that?

23:57.800 --> 23:58.820
Hey!

23:58.920 --> 24:01.020
Now, you got two of them named James.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.460
- Oh, you can call me Jim, Sister.
- And Orange is fine with me, ma'am.

24:03.560 --> 24:04.780
Or Big Fellow!

24:04.880 --> 24:06.820
All right. Well, this is fine with me.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.980
Mrs. Jackson. Hosea Williams.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.300
Or Castro!

24:11.400 --> 24:14.100
Oh, yeah, that's a long story.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.180
Those grits, they need some stirring.
Mind?

24:17.280 --> 24:18.905
You put your foot in it now.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.149
Ain't you supposed to be on a diet?

24:22.320 --> 24:23.581
Somebody call Juanita.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.820
- There's a phone!
- Hey, get off that phone.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.020
Juanita?

24:28.120 --> 24:30.461
Don't do it, Doc. Don't do it...

24:34.200 --> 24:36.268
Turning in, Doc. You okay?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.671
Yes, sir. Good night to you.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.383
I wanted to tell you that
the students are in town.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.220
Local students?

24:51.320 --> 24:53.184
Oh, no.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.181
The Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.861
Okay. Our young friends at SNCC.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.660
Good to know.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.022
You the one told them to organize.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.621
Took it to heart.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.500
Don't be surprised
if they don't give us grief tomorrow.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.385
Town folk may be happy to see us.
But SNCC?

25:16.600 --> 25:19.226
They feel we're in their territory.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.430
They're young and full of spirit.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.511
Not a bad thing.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.269
It'll sort out.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.470
Good night.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.111
Good night.

25:40.720 --> 25:45.020
"Boycotting the buses in Montgomery.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.427
"Segregation in Birmingham."

25:48.720 --> 25:51.061
Boycotting the buses in Montgomery.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.750
Segregation in Birmingham.

25:58.240 --> 26:02.061
Now? Voting in Selma.

26:03.760 --> 26:08.229
One struggle ends just to go
right to the next and the next.

26:10.120 --> 26:13.224
If you think of it that way,
it's a hard road.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.380
But I don't think of it that way.

26:17.480 --> 26:20.220
I think of these efforts as one effort.

26:20.320 --> 26:23.230
And that one effort is for our life.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.708
Our life as a community.
Our life as a nation.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.263
For our lives.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.031
We can do this.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.305
We must do this!

26:45.520 --> 26:49.020
We see children

26:49.120 --> 26:51.860
become victims of one
of the most vicious crimes

26:51.960 --> 26:56.543
ever perpetrated against humanity
within the walls of their own church!

26:58.440 --> 27:01.380
They are sainted now.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.780
They are the sainted ones
in this quest for freedom.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.540
And they speak to us still.

27:07.640 --> 27:11.904
They say to us, to all of us,
all colors and creeds,

27:13.120 --> 27:14.870
that we must do this.

27:15.200 --> 27:20.180
They say to us that it is unacceptable

27:20.280 --> 27:23.620
for more than 50% of Selma to be Negro

27:23.720 --> 27:27.220
and yet less than 2% of Negroes here
being able to vote

27:27.320 --> 27:30.424
and determine their own destiny
as human beings.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.500
They say to us that
the local white leadership

27:37.600 --> 27:40.980
use their power to
keep us away from the ballot box

27:41.080 --> 27:42.864
and keep us voiceless.

27:45.520 --> 27:50.308
As long as I am unable to exercise
my constitutional right to vote,

27:50.520 --> 27:53.220
I do not have command of my own life.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.820
I cannot determine my own destiny
for it is determined for me

27:56.920 --> 28:00.263
by people who would rather
see me suffer than succeed.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.300
Those that have gone before us say,
"No more!"

28:04.400 --> 28:05.620
No more! No more!

28:05.720 --> 28:07.260
No more!

28:07.360 --> 28:11.140
That means protest, that means march,

28:11.240 --> 28:15.460
that means disturb the peace,
that means jail,

28:15.560 --> 28:18.061
that means risk! And that is hard!

28:20.440 --> 28:23.060
We will not wait any longer.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.140
Give us the vote!

28:25.240 --> 28:26.910
That's right! No more!

28:27.200 --> 28:29.340
We're not asking. We're demanding.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.620
Give us the vote!

28:30.720 --> 28:31.946
Give us the vote!

28:41.760 --> 28:45.460
Dr. King.
Roy Reed of The New York Times.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.540
Yes. Hello to you. How are you?

28:47.640 --> 28:49.980
I'm well, sir. Thank you for asking.

28:50.080 --> 28:54.900
Dr. King, are you truly non-violent
if you are provoking violence, sir?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.980
We are here,
using our very bodies in protest

28:58.080 --> 28:59.900
- to say to those who deny us...
- Dr. King. Dr. King.

29:00.000 --> 29:00.980
Pleasure, sir.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.820
...that we will no longer let them
use their billy clubs

29:03.920 --> 29:06.740
in dark corners and halls of power.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.580
We make them do it
in the glaring light of day, Mr. Reed.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.620
Is SNCC standing with us
on this or not, gentlemen?

29:11.720 --> 29:14.060
You want us to bring our people in,
but you're not giving anything in return.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.580
Now we are asking
for some kind of commitment here.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.620
Respectfully speaking, of course,

29:18.720 --> 29:20.700
we've been handling
the voter registration

29:20.800 --> 29:22.540
in this town now for two years.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.107
Well, you haven't gotten very far,
have you?

29:26.280 --> 29:28.780
Well, maybe not, Reverend.
But we're still here.

29:28.880 --> 29:29.860
Meaning what?

29:29.960 --> 29:31.460
This time next month, you won't be!

29:31.560 --> 29:33.700
- That's insanity!
- Just like you left Albany.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.220
Those people are pathetic
down there now.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.460
Like they daddy left home!

29:36.560 --> 29:38.660
What we're trying
to explain is that in Albany you all...

29:38.760 --> 29:41.580
You know what I think?
Maybe we should just leave Selma...

29:41.680 --> 29:43.740
Now! Leave it to these two.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.060
Come back in another two years
and see how much further you got!

29:46.160 --> 29:48.069
- Sounds just fine to me.
- That's enough.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.181
Enough of this now.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.871
I haven't the time for this.
None of us got the time for this.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.025
John.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.071
James.

30:04.080 --> 30:07.700
The way our organization works
is straightforward.

30:07.800 --> 30:12.110
We negotiate. We demonstrate. We resist.

30:12.480 --> 30:17.620
And on our best days, our adversary
helps the matter by making a mistake.

30:17.720 --> 30:22.303
Now, we were in Albany for nine months
and we made a lot of mistakes.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.466
But their sheriff, Laurie Pritchett,

30:25.760 --> 30:27.620
he never made a mistake.

30:27.720 --> 30:31.060
Kept his cool,
kept arresting us in a humane way,

30:31.160 --> 30:34.580
carried people to
the jail-wagons on stretchers.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.862
Day in, day out.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.140
There was no drama.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.865
You mean there was no cameras.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.141
Exactly.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.340
Now I know, we all understand,
that you young people

30:48.440 --> 30:51.220
believe in working
in the community long-term.

30:51.320 --> 30:55.266
Doing the good work
to raise black consciousness.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.940
It's good grassroots work.

30:59.040 --> 31:03.350
I can't tell you
how much we admire that.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.340
But what we do

31:06.440 --> 31:08.340
is negotiate,

31:08.440 --> 31:09.980
demonstrate,

31:10.080 --> 31:11.180
resist.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.300
And a big part of that

31:13.400 --> 31:16.500
is raising white consciousness.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.900
And in particular the consciousness

31:18.000 --> 31:19.740
of whichever white man
happens to be sitting

31:19.840 --> 31:20.941
in the Oval Office.

31:21.560 --> 31:26.143
Right now, Johnson has other fish to fry
and he'll ignore us if he can.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.780
The only way to stop him doing that

31:29.880 --> 31:32.711
is by being on the front page
of the national press every morning

31:33.280 --> 31:37.020
and by being on the TV news every night.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.268
And that requires

31:40.000 --> 31:41.261
drama.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.901
Now...

31:46.360 --> 31:47.666
John.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.100
James.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.029
Answer me one question.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.900
I've been told the sheriff in this town
isn't like Laurie Pritchett in Albany.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.389
He's a big ignorant bully
like Bull Connor in Birmingham.

32:04.520 --> 32:07.420
Well, you tell me. You know Selma.

32:07.520 --> 32:10.066
You know Sheriff Jim Clark.

32:10.880 --> 32:15.668
Is he Laurie Pritchett?
Or is he Bull Connor?

32:25.280 --> 32:26.381
He's Bull Connor.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.983
- Bingo!
- Good.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.631
That's good.

32:35.680 --> 32:36.861
But it gets better.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.260
See, Clark doesn't control the streets
like Connor did in Birmingham.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.580
Clark's the County Sheriff,

32:42.680 --> 32:45.780
and all he controls in Selma
is the County Courthouse.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.300
So relatively speaking,

32:47.400 --> 32:52.267
we have clear avenues of approach
to a defined battle zone.

33:46.960 --> 33:50.180
In the courthouse
sits the heart of the matter,

33:50.280 --> 33:52.580
the voter registration office.

33:52.680 --> 33:54.500
Now this is an exceptional circumstance.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.660
See, in Albany, there were
no clearly defined battle zones.

33:58.760 --> 34:03.020
The issue was segregation,
and segregation was everywhere.

34:03.120 --> 34:08.226
In Selma, we can concentrate
our actions on one building.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.067
A citadel, defended by fanatics.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.585
The Selma Courthouse.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.504
A perfect stage.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.420
Y'all deliberately
causing an obstruction!

34:35.639 --> 34:37.860
You don't disperse,
you're gonna be arrested.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.060
I promise you!

34:39.159 --> 34:40.820
Sheriff Clark,

34:40.920 --> 34:43.739
we're trying to gain access
to the registration office.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.420
Which is our legal right.

34:45.520 --> 34:48.060
There's too many of you.
And you know damn well there is!

34:48.159 --> 34:50.340
Now, y'all just gonna have
to wait at the rear!

34:50.440 --> 34:51.940
No, Sheriff Clark.

34:52.040 --> 34:55.500
We're going in the front
and we're gonna wait right here.

34:55.600 --> 34:59.022
Segregation is now illegal
in this country, sir.

35:01.480 --> 35:02.540
Get out, nigger.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.660
- Come on.
- I'm trying.

35:03.760 --> 35:04.941
Kneel down, Daddy.

35:05.840 --> 35:07.226
Come on.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.423
Keep this sidewalk clear. Clear a path!

35:09.680 --> 35:12.140
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

35:12.240 --> 35:13.620
Get the hell out of the way!

35:13.720 --> 35:15.629
Keep the sidewalk clear!

35:15.880 --> 35:17.060
I said keep it clear!

35:17.160 --> 35:18.660
Okay. We about to sit him down.
He can't sit.

35:18.760 --> 35:19.820
Then he needs to learn.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.620
- He gonna sit.
- Sit down, God damn it!

35:21.720 --> 35:23.584
Hey, hey! Pa? Pa?

35:23.880 --> 35:25.391
Daddy.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.580
I just told you he can't sit.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.145
What do we got here?

35:31.120 --> 35:33.460
What's going on here, boy?
What we got here? What we got here?

35:33.560 --> 35:35.380
- Jimmie! Sit down!
- No, Mama, I'm sick of this.

35:35.480 --> 35:36.580
- Jimmie!
- Don't do it.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.340
- Do you have a problem, boy?
- I'm sick of this! I just told you...

35:39.440 --> 35:41.820
What'd you think, boy? What'd you think?

35:41.920 --> 35:43.670
What the fuck are you thinking?

35:54.240 --> 35:55.500
Get that nigger woman!

35:55.600 --> 35:56.906
Kill that nigger bitch!

35:57.480 --> 35:58.786
Get your hands off of me!

36:14.560 --> 36:17.940
We will not tolerate
a bunch of nigra agitators

36:18.040 --> 36:21.700
attempting to orchestrate
a disturbance in this state.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.709
Not as long as I'm governor.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.340
Now, I stand here today

36:30.440 --> 36:32.340
in the cradle of the Confederacy

36:32.440 --> 36:35.020
to remind its people
of our Founding Fathers'

36:35.120 --> 36:37.020
goals of duty.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.340
Goals long since forgotten
by progressives and liberals

36:40.440 --> 36:43.940
in favor of what they call
a changing world.

36:44.040 --> 36:47.860
They seek to make us one mongrel unit.

36:47.960 --> 36:52.020
Instead of allowing each race to flourish
from its separate racial station

36:52.120 --> 36:54.540
as has been the standard
for generations now.

36:54.640 --> 36:55.700
Good morning, Mr. President.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.820
Their changing world

36:57.920 --> 36:59.988
is sickening the balance
of the Southland.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.140
Now...

37:03.240 --> 37:06.660
I pledged to stand up
for Alabama when I campaigned

37:06.760 --> 37:08.700
and the people elected me
on that pledge,

37:08.800 --> 37:11.585
and that is exactly what I intend to do.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.467
Johnson'll flinch.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.028
I'm tired, Ralphy.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.829
Tiring of this.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.260
Eyes on the prize, Martin.

37:48.360 --> 37:52.260
Yeah, but what is the prize, friend?

37:52.360 --> 37:56.740
We fight to have a seat
at whatever table we want.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.940
How does it help a black man
to be able to eat at a lunch counter

38:00.040 --> 38:02.620
if he doesn't earn enough
to buy the burger?

38:04.040 --> 38:06.142
Or worse yet, can't even...

38:08.680 --> 38:10.020
Can't even read the menu

38:10.120 --> 38:13.540
'cause there was no Negro school
where he's from.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.660
What is that?

38:15.760 --> 38:16.941
That equality?

38:19.160 --> 38:20.180
Amen.

38:20.280 --> 38:22.428
And what about in our minds?

38:23.040 --> 38:26.826
Equality in the black psyche.
Look at these men.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.300
Beaten and broken down for generations.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.821
Deciding to demand more?

38:35.680 --> 38:38.460
What happens when a man stands up
and says enough is enough?

38:38.560 --> 38:40.340
Look at Medgar.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.460
Murdered the man in his own driveway.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.660
Kids and wife right there
inside the house.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.580
George and Herbert Lee, Lamar Smith.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.863
A man stands up, only to be struck down.

38:54.480 --> 38:57.186
And what happens to the people he led?

39:02.080 --> 39:04.262
What are we doing, Ralphy?

39:06.040 --> 39:08.541
We take it piece by piece.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.710
Like we been doing.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.701
We build the path as we can.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.303
Rock by rock.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.542
This cell is probably bugged.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.745
It probably is.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.065
Oh, Lord.

39:40.840 --> 39:45.821
They're gonna ruin me
so they can ruin this movement.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.620
They are.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.743
"Look at the birds of the air,

39:59.000 --> 40:03.025
"that they do not sow, nor reap,
nor gather into barns,

40:04.160 --> 40:07.742
"and yet your Heavenly Father
doth feed them.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.661
"Are you not worth much more than they?

40:13.200 --> 40:16.060
"And who of you by being worried

40:16.160 --> 40:18.786
"can add a single hour to his life?"

40:19.120 --> 40:21.060
Matthew 6, verse 27.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.625
All right.

40:23.520 --> 40:24.906
Yes, sir.

40:31.640 --> 40:32.820
What? Where did you hear that?

40:32.920 --> 40:35.180
I overheard them talking
about him coming in this evening.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.300
Overheard us?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.460
I'm learning about this just like you.
We didn't do this.

40:38.560 --> 40:39.980
That Negro can't be talking about that

40:40.080 --> 40:42.420
"by any means necessary" madness
with these people.

40:42.520 --> 40:43.940
They about to bust as it is.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.100
He's on his way here, right?

40:45.200 --> 40:46.860
So we gotta figure this out.
Right and fast.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.903
He ain't on his way. He here.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.711
Holy shit.

41:03.520 --> 41:04.826
Are you all right?

41:05.840 --> 41:09.501
I wish I had more time
to prepare is all.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.780
I want to do this kind of thing
whenever possible.

41:13.880 --> 41:17.063
But I don't get to do it enough
to feel entirely comfortable.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.831
I prefer to be prepared.

41:21.240 --> 41:24.060
Yes, I understand that.

41:24.160 --> 41:27.264
I admire you. I do.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.420
Sometimes I wish
I were more out there in the trenches.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.861
You do more than you know, Mrs. King.

41:36.520 --> 41:39.140
I'll tell you what I know to be true.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.020
It helps me in times
when I'm feeling unsure.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.820
If you'd like.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.261
Please do, Mrs. Boynton.

41:48.160 --> 41:51.700
I know that we are descendants
of a mighty people,

41:51.800 --> 41:54.426
who gave civilization to the world.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.340
People who survived
the hulls of slave ships

41:58.440 --> 42:00.300
across vast oceans.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.700
People who innovate and create and love

42:04.800 --> 42:09.189
despite pressures
and tortures unimaginable.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.980
They are in our bloodstream.

42:12.080 --> 42:14.786
Pumping our hearts every second.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.063
They've prepared you.

42:19.120 --> 42:22.060
You are already prepared.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.740
Mrs. King, I mean no disrespect.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.347
I come with great respect
for your husband.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.380
I have no army behind me anymore.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.020
I have myself and the truth.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.500
That is all I stand on today.

42:39.600 --> 42:42.860
You've said disrespectful things
in the past, Minister.

42:42.960 --> 42:45.580
So you'll understand
why there is some alarm here tonight.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.860
I do. I understand that.

42:48.960 --> 42:52.060
Your husband and I,
we do not see exactly eye-to-eye

42:52.160 --> 42:54.340
on how to achieve progress
for the black man.

42:54.440 --> 42:58.180
And yes, I have been piercing
in my critiques of non-violence.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.260
But because we don't agree, Mrs. King,

43:00.360 --> 43:02.500
does not mean that I'm the enemy.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.740
What do you intend to say
to these people then, sir?

43:05.840 --> 43:07.220
A lot of work has been done here,

43:07.320 --> 43:09.422
and I don't intend to
see it undone tonight.

43:11.520 --> 43:15.022
Let's just say,
my eyes see in a new way.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.104
But your local sheriff here?
He doesn't know that.

43:19.480 --> 43:21.901
So allow me to be the alternative
to your husband.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.740
The alternative that scares them so much

43:24.840 --> 43:26.660
they turn to Dr. King in refuge.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.140
Let my being here, Mrs. King,
represent the factions

43:29.240 --> 43:31.900
that will come if they don't
give the good reverend

43:32.000 --> 43:33.740
what he's asking for and soon.

43:33.840 --> 43:37.100
Do you know what he has said
about us in the past, Coretta?

43:37.200 --> 43:39.780
He called us "ignorant Negro preachers."

43:39.880 --> 43:41.980
Called me a modern day Uncle Tom.

43:42.080 --> 43:45.100
Said on national television
that the white man pays me

43:45.200 --> 43:48.260
to keep Negroes defenseless.

43:48.360 --> 43:51.384
The white man pays me!

43:53.280 --> 43:55.420
How could you allow it?

43:55.520 --> 43:59.140
It wasn't like that this time, Martin.
I'm telling you...

43:59.240 --> 44:01.620
He spoke with some of the words
he's used before,

44:01.720 --> 44:03.663
but it wasn't aimed at you.

44:04.160 --> 44:05.671
It was...

44:06.200 --> 44:07.665
It had more to do with helping us.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.620
Not that you need his help.
I'm just telling you how it was.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.460
This movement, our movement,

44:15.560 --> 44:17.780
has been the one
that has moved the needle.

44:17.880 --> 44:21.460
Our movement changes laws
and day-to-day life for our people.

44:21.560 --> 44:23.660
But what has he changed?

44:23.760 --> 44:26.181
Actually changed?

44:28.600 --> 44:31.300
You don't sound like yourself.
You sound tired.

44:31.400 --> 44:33.389
And you sound enamored.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.465
I didn't mean that.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.791
Corrie.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.705
Coretta.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.464
I didn't mean that.

45:06.080 --> 45:07.864
I'm tired.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.870
You're right.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.149
Rest then.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.581
Rest tonight, Martin.

45:24.960 --> 45:28.223
This is not what I want to hear.

45:28.760 --> 45:32.060
How in Christ's sake does
Malcolm X slip into my state,

45:32.160 --> 45:34.900
meet with the wife of the other one,

45:35.000 --> 45:36.940
and give an actual speech
to these nigras

45:37.040 --> 45:38.380
who are already riled up enough?

45:38.480 --> 45:39.740
I mean, how does that happen,
Colonel Lingo?

45:39.840 --> 45:41.380
Governor...

45:41.480 --> 45:44.743
Is every spook militant in existence
gonna pay us a visit?

45:47.800 --> 45:49.940
Do you know what this means?

45:50.040 --> 45:52.746
Johnson is going to get jumpy.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.780
King and X together is sending him
through the cotton-pickin' stratosphere.

45:56.880 --> 45:59.580
And pictures of nigras
getting beat in the street

45:59.680 --> 46:00.860
- doesn't help the matter.
- Governor...

46:00.960 --> 46:04.060
Now I can't make a move
against that backwoods,

46:04.160 --> 46:07.260
white trash Sheriff Clark 'cause
that'll be seen as I'm helping King.

46:07.360 --> 46:11.465
But somebody got to
get Jim Clark under control.

46:12.280 --> 46:13.500
Election year is coming up

46:13.600 --> 46:16.940
and this black voting business
won't abide.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.780
I mean, what's not clear about that?

46:18.880 --> 46:21.020
Look, George, I'm telling you,

46:21.120 --> 46:25.780
if the Lord Jesus and Elvis Presley
come visiting and they said,

46:25.880 --> 46:29.940
"Jim, now, we need you to
treat them niggers nice."

46:30.040 --> 46:32.700
Jim Clark would beat the shit
out of the pair of them,

46:32.800 --> 46:33.981
then throw them in jail.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.540
Jesus H. Christ.

46:36.640 --> 46:39.460
Jim's a good old boy,
he's a friend of mine.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.150
Jim Clark just ain't that scary.

46:42.680 --> 46:45.181
Now he's playing into their hands.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.300
Now...

46:47.400 --> 46:49.980
If you want fear,

46:50.840 --> 46:53.591
you need dominance in Selma.

46:54.720 --> 47:00.100
Hoover picked up some intel
about a night march.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.340
Wasn't announced.

47:01.440 --> 47:05.580
It's some locals outside of King's group.
Unofficial, they called it.

47:05.680 --> 47:10.100
Supposed to happen tomorrow night
once King leaves jail.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.951
Going to some bleeding heart fundraiser
in California.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.785
So...

47:20.600 --> 47:22.623
King's out of town.

47:23.400 --> 47:24.740
Fewer cameras.

47:26.480 --> 47:27.661
And at night.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.340
Find a reason to send us in there.

47:30.440 --> 47:33.980
Let's scare some real sense
into them black bastards.

47:34.080 --> 47:35.540
Y'all move back.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.390
Move back now. Get back.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.710
Go back to your homes now.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.260
Stop! Leave him be!

47:56.360 --> 47:57.507
Mama, come on!

47:58.120 --> 47:59.870
Mama, come on!

48:00.800 --> 48:02.709
We gotta keep moving. Come on.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.020
This way, this way.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.381
Leave him alone.

48:24.920 --> 48:26.226
It's all right.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.060
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

48:32.160 --> 48:33.140
Act like you're...

48:33.240 --> 48:34.501
Act like you're reading your menu. Okay?

48:35.720 --> 48:36.901
It's okay.

48:37.960 --> 48:39.107
Pops...

48:40.160 --> 48:43.220
It's all right, Mama.
It's gonna be cool.

48:43.320 --> 48:44.990
It's okay, it's okay.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.741
Hey! Hey...

48:56.440 --> 48:59.100
No, get off of him! Just get off of him!

48:59.200 --> 49:01.746
Get off of him! No!

49:02.440 --> 49:04.224
No! Get off of him!

49:07.880 --> 49:09.391
Stop it! No, no, no!

49:11.480 --> 49:12.866
Stop it!

49:39.240 --> 49:40.387
Help me.

49:53.120 --> 49:54.460
Help me.

49:55.520 --> 49:56.860
Jimmie.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.940
Jimmie. Jimmie. Jimmie.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.187
Help me.

50:21.440 --> 50:22.905
Sir?

50:29.440 --> 50:30.746
Dr. King.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.150
There are no words to soothe you,
Mr. Lee.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.587
There are no words.

50:59.480 --> 51:02.868
But I can tell you one thing
for certain.

51:05.680 --> 51:07.300
God was the first to cry.

51:07.400 --> 51:08.911
Yes.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.020
He was the first to cry for your boy.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.984
Yes. I believe that.

51:17.760 --> 51:19.589
Is your daughter...

51:20.760 --> 51:23.784
Is Jimmie Lee's mother here, Mr. Lee?

51:25.240 --> 51:28.822
No, she... She couldn't make it.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.111
May I ask your age, sir?

51:39.200 --> 51:41.701
Well, I... I got 82 years.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.820
1883.

51:43.920 --> 51:45.100
Right.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.382
Yeah. Jimmie...

51:50.920 --> 51:53.022
He born in '38.

51:54.360 --> 51:56.060
He a Army man.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.740
I mean, he was... Was an Army man.

51:58.840 --> 52:01.227
In the Army a spell.

52:02.760 --> 52:07.460
He say, "Pa, you gonna vote
before you done."

52:07.560 --> 52:09.503
That's what he said.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.304
He tell me.

52:15.560 --> 52:17.580
- He was a good boy.
- Yes.

52:17.680 --> 52:18.861
Always good.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.624
Always good.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.664
Jimmie gone.

52:35.760 --> 52:38.101
I'm so sorry.

52:43.680 --> 52:44.861
Yeah.

53:00.720 --> 53:06.145
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

53:10.320 --> 53:14.220
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

53:16.520 --> 53:18.980
We know a state trooper

53:19.080 --> 53:21.260
acting under the orders
of George Wallace

53:21.360 --> 53:23.861
pointed the gun and pulled the trigger.

53:25.280 --> 53:29.226
But how many other fingers
were on that trigger?

53:32.360 --> 53:34.701
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

53:36.960 --> 53:41.748
Every white lawman
who abuses the law to terrorize.

53:44.760 --> 53:47.620
Every white politician

53:47.720 --> 53:50.903
who feeds on prejudice and hatred.

53:53.080 --> 53:56.700
Every white preacher
who preaches the Bible

53:56.800 --> 53:59.710
and stays silent
before his white congregation.

54:03.840 --> 54:06.784
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson?

54:07.880 --> 54:13.740
Every Negro man and woman
who stands by without joining this fight

54:13.840 --> 54:16.740
as their brothers and sisters
are humiliated,

54:16.840 --> 54:19.830
brutalized, and ripped from this earth!

54:27.040 --> 54:28.900
When I heard

54:29.000 --> 54:32.468
President Kennedy
had been shot and killed...

54:33.840 --> 54:36.380
And when I heard just yesterday

54:36.480 --> 54:38.260
that Malcolm X,

54:38.360 --> 54:41.580
who stood in this very church
just three weeks ago,

54:41.680 --> 54:43.782
had been shot and killed,

54:45.480 --> 54:47.780
I turned to my wife Coretta

54:47.880 --> 54:52.622
and said the same thing I often say
when one of our leaders is struck down,

54:54.440 --> 54:57.460
"Our lives are not fully lived

54:57.560 --> 55:00.743
"if we're not willing to die
for those we love

55:01.200 --> 55:02.825
"and for what we believe."

55:06.880 --> 55:09.300
But today, Jimmie,

55:09.400 --> 55:13.186
we're doing the living
and you've done the dying, dear brother.

55:14.160 --> 55:18.300
We will not let your sacrifice
pass in vain, dear brother.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.340
We will not let it go!

55:20.440 --> 55:22.620
We will finish what you were after!

55:22.720 --> 55:25.140
We will get what you were denied!

55:25.240 --> 55:28.740
We will vote and we will
put these men out of office!

55:28.840 --> 55:30.820
We will take their power!

55:30.920 --> 55:33.340
We will win
what you were slaughtered for!

55:33.440 --> 55:35.508
Yeah!

55:38.160 --> 55:40.547
We're going back to Washington.

55:41.080 --> 55:43.100
We're going to demand
to see the President.

55:43.200 --> 55:45.380
And I'm gonna tell him

55:45.480 --> 55:48.660
that Jimmie was murdered
by an administration

55:48.760 --> 55:51.660
that spends millions
of dollars every day

55:51.760 --> 55:55.100
to sacrifice life
in the name of liberty in Vietnam,

55:55.200 --> 55:58.140
yet lacks the moral will
and the moral courage

55:58.240 --> 56:03.062
to defend the lives
of its own people here in America!

56:04.600 --> 56:06.543
We will not let it go!

56:07.600 --> 56:11.460
And if he does not act, we will act.
We will act!

56:11.560 --> 56:13.860
We will do it for all of our lost ones.

56:13.960 --> 56:16.260
All of those, like Jimmie Lee Jackson,

56:16.360 --> 56:20.226
who have gone too soon, taken by hate!

56:28.200 --> 56:29.860
Let me hear the top-tier issues

56:29.960 --> 56:33.860
that have to be evident
in the overall legislation we demand.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.100
Let's break it down.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.746
But let's root this discussion
in what we know.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.980
We know Johnson
can't see the full picture.

56:41.080 --> 56:42.820
So, let's paint it for him.

56:42.920 --> 56:46.980
What are the specific hardships
and humiliations

56:47.080 --> 56:51.105
we can address within the larger
context of legislation?

56:52.480 --> 56:55.580
Doc, we gotta start
with banning these laws that

56:55.680 --> 56:58.180
if a Negro tries to register,

56:58.280 --> 57:01.111
I mean, actually musters up the courage
to go in that courthouse,

57:01.680 --> 57:04.780
that their name and address
is published in the paper.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.260
It gives anybody who wants
to do them any harm

57:07.360 --> 57:09.980
their exact location,
and we know how the Klan is.

57:10.080 --> 57:12.820
I hear that. But the poll taxes
got to be our focus first.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.387
'Cause black people are poor!
Black people are poor down here.

57:15.680 --> 57:17.260
- Yep.
- And they expected to pay for every year

57:17.360 --> 57:19.420
they weren't legally registered
before they can register.

57:19.520 --> 57:22.305
Now, what the hell is that?
Who got that kind of money?

57:23.880 --> 57:25.580
Come on now! Listen now!

57:25.680 --> 57:28.260
The big issue is voting vouchers.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.420
Is that the number one issue?

57:29.520 --> 57:30.580
Now hold on. Let me finish.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.220
'Cause everybody'll forget
about this part.

57:32.320 --> 57:35.100
But if you're Negro,
the only way you can vote

57:35.200 --> 57:37.780
is if an approved registered
voter vouches for you.

57:37.880 --> 57:41.109
Right? So, let's say, you take
some place like Lowndes County,

57:41.240 --> 57:43.220
where there are no Negroes
who are registered

57:43.320 --> 57:45.260
and you've got to have
someone who is registered

57:45.360 --> 57:47.100
to vouch for you.

57:47.200 --> 57:48.506
What are you supposed to do?

57:49.880 --> 57:51.460
Nobody you know,

57:51.560 --> 57:55.780
not a single black person
for 100 miles is registered.

57:55.880 --> 57:59.380
So how do you get the voucher, right?

57:59.480 --> 58:01.820
To get you into the courthouse door

58:01.920 --> 58:04.300
to pay the poll tax

58:04.400 --> 58:06.821
to get your name published

58:07.120 --> 58:08.460
and get yourself dead.

58:09.920 --> 58:10.900
That's true.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.500
We need a new plan!

58:12.600 --> 58:14.180
I can't take him back to Washington

58:14.280 --> 58:17.060
and waltz into the White House
with a list of empty demands.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.020
Tactics, my friends!

58:19.120 --> 58:21.740
We must break down this institution

58:21.840 --> 58:24.830
into the tangible tactics
that it takes to dismantle it.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.140
What's your next move?

58:28.240 --> 58:32.500
A march from Selma to Montgomery
to protest and amplify.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.540
Well, I'll be damned.

58:34.640 --> 58:37.020
This was always part of the plan,
wasn't it?

58:37.120 --> 58:40.144
Provoke some tragedy
in little old Selma, then go big.

58:40.600 --> 58:44.147
Get someone killed
and march on the State Capitol!

58:44.440 --> 58:47.100
Selma to Montgomery's gotta be 50 miles!

58:47.200 --> 58:49.900
You march those people
into rural Alabama unprotected,

58:50.000 --> 58:51.140
it's gonna be open season.

58:51.240 --> 58:53.700
It's too damn far
and too damn dangerous!

58:53.800 --> 58:55.660
Then propose new legislation, sir.

58:55.760 --> 58:58.431
I can't do that this year. I won't!
I told you.

58:58.880 --> 59:00.860
We need your involvement here,
Mr. President.

59:00.960 --> 59:03.580
We deserve your help
as citizens of this country.

59:03.680 --> 59:05.020
Citizens under attack.

59:05.120 --> 59:07.940
Now, you listen to me. You listen to me.

59:08.040 --> 59:09.900
You're an activist. I'm a politician.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.580
You got one big issue.
I got a hundred and one.

59:12.680 --> 59:14.620
Now, you demanding more

59:14.720 --> 59:17.020
and putting me on the spot
with this visit, that's okay.

59:17.120 --> 59:18.860
That's your job. That's what you do.

59:18.960 --> 59:21.540
But I am sick and tired

59:21.640 --> 59:26.300
of you demanding and telling me
what I can and what I can't do.

59:26.400 --> 59:28.100
If you want my support
on this voting thing,

59:28.200 --> 59:30.302
I need some quid pro quo from you.

59:30.680 --> 59:32.060
What do you want, Mr. President?

59:32.160 --> 59:35.582
We have a line on some threats that are

59:37.000 --> 59:38.420
particularly troubling.

59:38.520 --> 59:40.220
Well, what's new?

59:40.320 --> 59:44.900
No, no. This is serious.
Credible threats with detail.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.785
This information,
coming from the FBI, I assume?

59:48.800 --> 59:50.026
High-level?

59:50.520 --> 59:53.900
The same high-level
that's been tracking us like animals?

59:54.000 --> 59:57.786
Bugging our homes and our hotel rooms.

59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.867
Digging for things that
simply are not there, Lee?

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.460
This all feels very convenient.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.906
Okay.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.740
This is coming
from Lowndes County, Alabama.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.068
Between Selma and Montgomery.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.940
I'm telling you, if he were my guy,

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.541
I'd keep him off the frontlines.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:22.586
Just for a while.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.900
Not gonna happen, Lee.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.180
Meet me halfway on this, Martin.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.340
I can't, Mr. President.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.100
Can't or won't?

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.749
I came here hoping
to talk to you about people.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.900
People are dying in the street for this.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.580
It cannot wait, sir.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.582
Mr. President, how did it go?

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.630
What can I do to help?

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.627
Get me J. Edgar Hoover.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.186
King,

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.020
you know you are a complete fraud

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.140
and a liability to all nigras.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.469
Like all frauds,
your end is approaching.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.944
You are done.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.581
Your degrees and your fancy awards
will not save you.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.820
The American public will
soon know you for what you are,

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.388
an evil, abnormal beast.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.065
That wasn't me.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.829
That isn't me, Corrie.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.586
I know.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.751
I know what you sound like.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.748
I've gotten used to a lot.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.666
All the hours
wondering after your safety,

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.467
worried about how you are.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.581
This house.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.020
Renting here.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.864
No foundation.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.780
Without the things
the children should have,

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.108
all because of how it would look.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.667
I have gotten used to it,

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.151
for better or worse.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.908
But what I have never gotten used to

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.268
is the death.

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:17.028
The constant closeness of death.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.629
It's become like a thick fog to me.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:29.460
I can't see life sometimes

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.870
because of the fog of death
constantly hanging over.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.020
People actually say that
they will stop the blood

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.500
running through the hearts
of our children.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.022
That's what they said on the other end
of that phone line.

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.946
How they're going to kill my children.

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.980
And what they'll do to you
and how they'll do it.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.500
How many years
have I had to listen to this?

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.700
The filth,

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.543
deranged and twisted
and just ignorant enough to be serious.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.509
If I ask you something,

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.542
will you answer me with the truth?

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.661
Yes.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.589
Good, because I am not a fool.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.263
Do you love me?

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.707
Yes, I love you, Coretta.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.387
Do you love any of the others?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.989
No.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.106
I need to put the march back a day.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.581
Why?

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.187
I have to be home right now.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.903
Yes. Okay. I understand.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.620
But I have to tell you
the organization looks good.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.220
Real good.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.620
The mood is strong.
And the locals are prepared.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.460
The SNCC kids are ready to go.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:18.667
We can start it off from Selma,
and you can join in on the second day.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.340
I just think it'd be a mistake
to hold people back

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.065
when their blood is up.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.020
I hear you, but we need
to be out there full throttle.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.660
This ain't a test run.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.180
We need to get to Montgomery.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.820
I warned Johnson that
we were going to the Capitol.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.863
We need to do just that.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.182
And I believe we will. We'll get there.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.220
And when we do the real deal,
the finale,

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.380
when you make the big speech at the end,

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.821
right on Wallace's doorstep.

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.026
I don't know, Andy.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.183
It'll be just fine.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:28.426
We'll get it started strong.
And you'll finish strong.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.062
Okay. Let's proceed.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.580
But only one of us walks to start.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.751
I don't want to get back on Monday
and find all our leadership in jail.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.860
One of us walks.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.950
Understood.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.944
There will be no march
from Selma to Montgomery.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.740
It is not conducive to traffic flow
on Route 80.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.260
Or to public safety.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.940
Your lives could be in danger,

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.220
but we're going to be strong
if we stick together.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.663
Don't fight back.
It's a non-violent movement.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.149
Non-violence is not passive.
It's actually very strong.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.900
We shouldn't do this, John.
This is not us. This is not SNCC.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.260
It's some bullshit.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:19.669
It's gonna do more for King
and the SCLC than for Selma.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.100
This is Alabama.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.580
They can keep their asses
in Washington, D.C.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.899
You don't tell us how to live our lives.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.300
This is an example of what
you might deal with out there.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:31.460
What you might experience.
Here we go. Let's show them.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.460
We don't want your kind here.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.140
Go to the bottom of the river,
black boy.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.819
We're going to put you down
in Alabama River!

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.060
He's not even here.
How's it gonna do more for him?

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.939
Well, why ain't he here, then, man?

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.979
Are you listening to yourself?

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.380
First, it's gonna do more for him.
Now, it's why he ain't here?

01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:46.899
Do you want him here,
or do you not want him here?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.660
Honestly, I don't give a rat's ass
about that man. That's your hero.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.660
Let's take these bastards
and stick them down into Alabama River

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.939
and never see them again.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.460
James, you are so off-base with this.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.300
All this nonsense.
This ain't what SNCC is about.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:58.500
Don't make me out to be
the bad guy here, John.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.300
I'm not!
You're the one playing me small.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.149
Don't demonize me...

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.667
You're mad because they called him in.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.979
We were here first.
And they called him in.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.620
I get it. I understand that.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.020
But if we are really
and truly for the people,

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.541
and the people of Selma chose him,

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.988
well, then the people have spoken.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.189
And if they want to march,
then I'm marching with them.

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.865
Then, brother,

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:33.381
you're marching as John Lewis.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.944
Not as part of SNCC.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.862
It's been voted on and decided.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.825
For this march, you're on your own
with De Lawd and his disciples.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.789
Short man wins. Short man wins.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.910
Short man wins.

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.746
All right.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:26.908
All right. Who got it?

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.060
It's on you, Hosea.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.700
You ready, young blood? You ready?

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:35.346
- All right. Let's do this.
- All right.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.580
About 525 Negroes
had left Brown's Chapel

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:46.304
and walked six blocks to cross
Pettus Bridge and the Alabama River.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.860
There were young and old,

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.740
and they carried an assortment of packs,

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.022
bed rolls and lunch sacks.

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.350
The troopers were waiting
300 yards beyond the end of the bridge.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.349
Behind the troopers
were dozens of possemen,

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.821
15 of them on horses,
and perhaps 100 white spectators.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.949
Can you swim?

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.501
Not many swimming pools for black folk
where I come from.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.190
Yeah.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:23.948
Andy. It's Bayard. Everybody there?

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.100
Yes.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.380
Turn on CBS right now, Andy.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.820
Right now. You have a TV there?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.989
- Yes. Now?
- Right now!

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.064
Turn on the television set.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.144
We interrupt this program to bring you
a special bulletin from CBS News.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:55.220
Give 'em two minutes. Stand right there.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.785
We're ready.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.980
This is an unlawful assembly.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.380
You have two minutes to disperse.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:17.300
Go home or go to your church.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.583
This march will not continue.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.949
Two minutes.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.945
May I have a word with the Major?

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.183
There's no word to be had.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.503
Major Cloud, may we speak with you?

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.224
Troopers, advance!

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.420
Seventy million people
are watching this.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.420
The first 10 or 20 Negroes

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:15.260
were swept to the ground screaming,
arms and legs flying,

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.623
packs and bags went skittering
across the grassy divider.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.820
Those still on their feet retreated.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.940
A cheer went up
from the white spectators

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.790
lining the south side of the highway.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.020
Come on. You gotta come on.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.346
Please, don't...

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.980
The troopers continued pushing,
using both the force of their bodies

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.625
and the prodding of their nightsticks.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.820
Suddenly, there was a sharp sound,
like a gunshot,

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.020
and a gray cloud spewed over
the troopers and the Negroes.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.620
But before the cloud hid it all,

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:25.984
there were several seconds
of unobstructed view.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:50.300
Fifteen or 20 nightsticks
could be seen through the gas,

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.151
flailing at the heads of the marchers.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.780
The Negroes cried out
as they crowded together for protection,

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:00.142
and the whites on the sidelines
whooped and cheered.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:15.500
From the hospital
came reports of victims

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.820
suffering fractures of ribs,
heads, arms and legs.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.900
And Negro leader John Lewis,

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.300
despite injury from
a possible skull fracture,

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.180
led the marchers back to the chapel

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.462
after the encounter with officers.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.825
Help!

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.341
Help!

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.860
He said,
"I don't see how President Johnson

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.471
"can send troops to Vietnam

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.380
"and can't send troops
to Selma, Alabama."

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:50.710
To which the Negroes present
roared their approval.

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.180
Gerry! Gerry, come with us!
Come with us!

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.540
We need your gun, man!

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.980
I can't walk!

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.660
Come with us. We know you got
them guns in the shed, Gerry.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.100
Hey, hey, hey, what you need guns for?

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.860
The Bible says,
"An eye for an eye," Reverend.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.500
- Yeah?
- I'm sick of this shit!

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.660
How many guns
you think they got down there?

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.620
That's an entire army down there.

01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:53.020
What you got? A couple of .32s? A .38?

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.420
Maybe a couple of old scatterguns? What?

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.020
I got enough to kill a couple
of them crackers, that's what I got!

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.380
And how many of us you think
they gonna kill in retaliation?

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.580
With their 12-gauge pump-actions,
their Colt automatics,

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.260
their Remingtons,
their helicopters, their tanks!

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.380
We won't win that way,
and I ain't talking about the Bible.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.780
I ain't talking what's right by God.
I am talking facts. Cold, hard facts!

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.220
Now, you take two of them,
and they take 10 of us.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:23.027
No. We have to win another way.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.582
...to our regularly scheduled program.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.308
We're going back to the bridge.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:43.307
We're going to finish this,
we promise you that, Ms. Amelia.

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.383
We go again.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:56.100
Dr. King! Can we get a statement, sir?

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.980
Dr. King! Morning, Doctor.
Can we get a statement, please?

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.591
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:07.430
While rageful violence continues
towards the unarmed people of Selma,

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:13.420
while they are assaulted with tear gas
and batons like an enemy in a war,

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.060
no citizen of this country
can call themselves blameless,

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.946
for we all bear a responsibility
for our fellow man.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.460
I am appealing to men and women of God

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:26.540
and goodwill everywhere,

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.940
white, black and otherwise.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.780
If you believe all are created equal,
come to Selma.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.429
Join us. Join our march
against injustice and inhumanity.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:41.990
We need you to stand with us.

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:47.500
Judge Johnson, Dr. King's call-to-action

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:49.429
was nationally televised.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.820
We've seen hundreds of people
travel across the country

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.660
to attend tomorrow's march,

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.945
mostly white,
mostly clergy of some kind.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:03.540
The SCLC is seeking
a federal court order

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:07.222
enjoining the state authorities
from interfering with the next march.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.540
You're asking me to overturn
the Governor's mandate

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.660
and to do so without a hearing,

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:16.060
but it's not going to happen at all
without a proper proceeding.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:19.100
Dr. King is in position to
lead tomorrow's march, Judge.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:23.180
Understood, but you will have
your day in court on Thursday, Mr. Gray.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.060
Meanwhile, there will be
no march tomorrow.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.786
I will not oppose Wallace
against protocol.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.024
"Thousands head south in moral crusade."

01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:41.109
The SCLC already filed an appeal
against Wallace's orders this morning.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.668
You want my advice, Mr. President?

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.585
You have to ask?

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:50.664
Give King the march to Montgomery.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:55.703
Do that, and then Selma's over.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.260
Then you're back in control.

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.340
In control of what?

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.300
Another civil war?

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:05.820
This ain't about the goddamn march.
You think he cares about the march?

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.626
He wants the law changed, now.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.580
I've got Congress
calling me by the dozens.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.180
I've got picketing that gets
bigger and bigger every day.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.951
He tugs on their goddamn
white liberal conscience.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.260
Every march pulls 'em.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.430
Especially when people
are getting beat up in the streets.

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.346
These pictures are
going around the world, Lee.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.220
I understand, Mr. President.
All the more reason to act now.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.467
I'm gonna act now.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.900
You tell Wallace
and those backwater hicks

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.060
I don't want to see any more
of this horseshit.

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.260
And you tell King he best not march,
you hear me?

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.780
Either King stops and Wallace stops,

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:45.900
or I'll stop 'em both.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.547
I'm here on the President's order
to try and make this work.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.345
Please work with me.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:55.463
So we give up the march and you...

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.865
You give what?

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.220
We asked for federal protection.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:03.340
And with no disrespect, but when
the Assistant Attorney General

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:05.500
is the highest-ranking
federal official in Selma,

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.820
we have our answer.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.140
And it's not the one we want.

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.940
Might I suggest that
you speak with Governor Wallace

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.660
and Sheriff Clark
and urge them against violence

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.501
instead of trying to persuade us
not to have a peaceful protest?

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.303
Maybe we can make a deal.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.230
What if I

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.980
could assure you that the administration

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.865
would endorse a later march

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.671
if tomorrow is called off?

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.540
You know what?
He's closer than you may think

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.391
to coming around on this issue.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.700
I believe this compromise
might be agreeable.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:52.140
Mr. Doar?

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:57.708
Thousands have gathered here
to demonstrate their dignity.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:01.140
I don't want to challenge Judge Johnson.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.549
I don't want to go against the President.
I don't want any of this.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.020
The President could stop this
with a stroke of his pen.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.220
He chooses not to.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.900
The decision is with your side, sir,

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:15.101
not ours.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.100
Good to see you, Father.
Good to see you.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.540
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming out.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.663
Hello, sister.
Good to see you this afternoon.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.100
You came.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.860
You called and we came, my friend.
You are not alone, my friend.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:38.100
Welcome, welcome.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.660
- Hi, what's your name?
- Susan.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.544
Hi, I'm Viola. Welcome to Selma.

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.340
- Yes, ma'am, I'm good. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.020
What is your name
and where are you from, sir?

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.900
My name is James Reeb.
I've come from Boston.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.422
Tell me, why have you traveled here,
Mr. Reeb?

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.740
I heard about the attack
of innocent people

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.305
who just want their rights,

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:03.460
and I couldn't just stand by
when Dr. King put out that call to clergy.

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:04.860
I couldn't.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.791
The President doesn't
want us to march today.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.700
The courts don't want us to march.

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.780
But we must march.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:12.900
Yeah!

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.700
- We must stand up.
- Yeah!

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.746
We must make a massive
demonstration of our moral certainty.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.181
I'm so glad we're here together today.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.820
I thank you for standing up.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.060
For we shall be victorious in our quest.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.230
We shall cross the finish line
hand in hand.

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.790
For we shall overcome. All right.

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.625
Troopers, withdraw!

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.620
My point is,
after what happened the last time,

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.820
if it don't feel right, we don't do it.
That's my point.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.740
We've been going round
and round on this for hours,

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.340
and nothing's gonna change the fact that

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.300
it was Doc's decision
and we have to support him.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.980
This is a movement of many, not of one.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.580
So any choice we make
has to be right for many.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:00.940
Come on, Diane. Now, you know

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.180
that's not what I meant
by that, all right?

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.667
People are angry, Dr. King.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:09.900
Angry. They went back to that bridge
because they were hot about Sunday.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.900
That was our moment out there today.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.465
And you threw it away.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:16.340
They could've sealed off
the road behind us.

01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:20.465
No food, water,
no kind of support allowed through.

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.620
We wouldn't have made 10 miles.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.185
You saying this was a trap?

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.951
I don't know what it was.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.740
That was no trap!

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:33.829
You know why they opened up
the road to us?

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.100
Because all them nice,
respectable white folks was with us,

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:38.940
and we should've capitalized on that.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.300
Because they're not gonna be
around here for long. They never are!

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.620
It was Martin's call. It's done.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.500
He made the wrong goddamn call!

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.940
Hey, watch your mouth, young man!

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.620
Two days ago,
you didn't wanna march at all.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.100
And now you're mad because
it didn't go the way you planned?

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.984
Calm down, brother.

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:01.547
Now, what happened out there today?
You gotta tell us something. Please.

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.820
I'd rather people be upset and hate me

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:15.024
than be bleeding or dead.

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:12.671
My dearest Corrie,

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.742
at a time when I need you,

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:19.708
I cannot call you.

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.942
And I have done this to myself, to us.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.628
At this late hour,

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:35.020
my thoughts are of you

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.986
and all you have sacrificed
for this struggle.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:43.470
So many have sacrificed.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.986
So many have been lost.

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.867
I wonder how many must we lose.

01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:00.911
I pray for discernment and guidance
as we journey on.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:07.062
I pray, too, that I can justify
the faith you once had in me.

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:16.385
I, too, often feel that
heavy fog you spoke of, Corrie.

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.906
Only you and our family clears the haze.

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.190
Love, Martin.

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.266
He betrayed trust.

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.820
He called, we came,
and he didn't fulfill his own call.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:39.020
Yeah, but sometimes
it's not that clear-cut.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.507
Sometimes it's instinctual.

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.144
Like when you're preaching,

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.549
and you're just flying.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:50.860
You know, you're not on the notes.
You're not on memory.

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:55.543
You're tapped into what's higher,
what's true.

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.751
God is guiding you.

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.629
I've known that feeling.
It's rare, but I've known it.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:09.780
I think that's what happened to Dr. King
up there on the bridge today.

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.340
He kneeled down,
prayed to God and got an answer.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:15.300
And he was brave enough
to follow that answer,

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:18.260
and I, for one, don't fault him for it.

01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.747
Except he owes me a bus ticket home.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:22.700
You know what I hate more than niggers?

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.231
What's that?

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:25.986
White niggers.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.300
Look, we don't want trouble, okay?

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.264
No, you came here stirrin' trouble.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.707
Doc,

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.985
someone's been hurt.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:59.789
A priest, from Boston.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.501
White.

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.300
Now you know what
being a nigger around here

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.264
feels like, boy.

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.067
Hurt? How?

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.066
Dead.

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.425
I need a phone!

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.540
Chicago, Detroit, Boston, I don't care.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:44.220
Hell, you got 2,000 people
marching up in Harlem.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:45.380
Well, good for you.

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.020
But when you have people
come inside the White House?

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.905
Inside the White House! On a tour?

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.420
They just sat down, Martin.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:55.260
They sat down in the main corridor,
started singin' and shoutin'.

01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.500
Well, I won't have it!

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.980
I cannot stop people from expressing...

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.864
You can! You can stop them.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.700
No, you can stop it.
You, sir, can do more.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.940
Now I'm glad to hear that you
called Reverend Reeb's widow, sir.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.980
That is very fine, and it is right.

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.060
I only wish that
Jimmie Lee Jackson's family

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.740
would have received the same
consideration from their President.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.820
Don't you lay your guilt at my door.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.300
You're the one choosing to send

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.020
people out to slaughter
when we told you there was trouble.

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:21.260
We won't sit idle

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:24.100
while you wait another year or two
to send this bill up at your leisure.

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.260
That should be clear by now.

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.180
We will continue to demonstrate
until you take action, sir.

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.420
And if our President
won't protect our rights,

01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.031
we will take this fight to court.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.260
You know, I'm... I'm trying here.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.980
We're getting close
to figuring something out

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.104
on this voting thing,
but I will not have this!

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:47.060
This bill has been almost impossible
to craft, you hear me?

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.662
You think you're jugglin', Martin?
I'm jugglin', too.

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.548
I am a preacher from Atlanta.

01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:56.820
You are the man who won the presidency

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.620
of the world's most powerful nation

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.142
by the greatest landslide
in history four months ago.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.620
And you are the man

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:08.030
dismantling your own legacy
with each passing day.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:11.502
No one will remember
the Civil Rights Act.

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.540
But they will remember
the standoff in Selma

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.300
when you never even
set foot in this state.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:20.940
They will remember you saying,
"Wait, " and "I can't,"

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:24.542
unless you act, sir.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.269
- Evenin'.
- Evenin'.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.741
I wanted to speak privately.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.340
I know there's been trouble
with the group,

01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.909
and I apologize that our efforts
have caused a rift between y'all.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.221
That's a painful thing, I know,
and I'm truly sorry it's happened.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.704
Yeah, painful.

01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.271
LBJ is not moving, John.

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.900
I thought he would,
but our efforts are not working,

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.340
and I can't risk another march
with people getting killed

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.304
when it's not working. I won't do it.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:35.503
We need voting, not marching.
You know that.

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.620
We have to move beyond these protests
to some real political power.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.141
This can't go on forever like this.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.788
I can't go on like this.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.190
When I was...

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.065
When I was working with SNCC
on the Freedom Rides,

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.222
the Montgomery bus
reached the city limits.

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.346
We got off. And out of nowhere,

01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.711
from all directions, they came.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.708
There was men, women.

01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:35.265
Kids, too.

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:42.620
They had just about every makeshift
weapon you could think of.

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:45.551
I mean, bats, bricks,

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.381
tire irons, pipes.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:55.909
I remember...

01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.380
I remember this little girl
just clawing her nails

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:05.420
into the side of my friend Jessie's face

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:09.705
while her daddy...
Her daddy beat him with an ax handle.

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:14.500
Jessie was unconscious,

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.182
and they just kept beating on him
and beating on him.

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:25.542
I must've passed out
on the asphalt somewhere.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:34.943
Next day, I found myself patched up
and sitting in a church.

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:39.301
I could barely hold my head up,
but I needed to be there.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.302
You were gonna be speaking.

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:46.342
And I needed to hear you.

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.944
And I was feeling down,
but you got up there.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.110
You remember that day at all?

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:00.630
I don't think we remember it
the same way.

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.744
What'd I say, John?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.421
I'm about to tell you right now.

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.629
And I hope you hear me.

01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.386
You said that we would triumph.

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:19.787
That we would triumph
because there could be no other way.

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:25.783
And you know what else you said?

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:31.867
You said,

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.305
"Fear not.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:38.704
"We've come too far to turn back now."

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:54.100
I feel good about where we are.
We have a strong case.

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.631
- We can do this.
- Right.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:59.900
Now, Ms. Cooper
and Ms. Boynton are here,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.387
and they need to be ready.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.620
A lot depends
on what they have to say. Okay?

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.310
I hear what you're saying, but...

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.665
You're here.

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.949
Yes, I'm here.

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.860
I'm glad.

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.828
Just in time.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:01.420
In the matter of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:02.900
v. The state of Alabama,

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.661
I will now hear testimony
from the plaintiffs. Mr. Gray.

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:10.060
Your Honor, you will hear testimony
from the victims

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:13.380
who were beaten and bludgeoned
in their quest for freedom.

01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:16.550
For their right to vote
and to self-determine.

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:18.260
The fact of the matter, Your Honor,

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:21.430
is that the incidents that occurred
cannot be disputed.

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.261
These particular circumstances

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:30.230
will paint a thorough picture
of the horrific events endured in Selma.

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.980
Very well, you may proceed.

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:37.310
Mr. King, you went out on that bridge
in direct violation of that judge's orders.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:41.467
You deliberately disobeyed this judge
and the Governor, did you not?

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.700
Thousands of people came to Selma,

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:48.904
aroused by Sunday's brutal acts

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:52.860
exacted by officials
of the city of Selma

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.780
and the state of Alabama.

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:57.900
I felt if I had not led the march,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.220
pent-up emotions and inner tensions
would have led to an uncontrollable

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.502
retaliatory situation,

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.220
a violent situation on both sides.

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.100
I don't need any of your preaching
and prancing in here,

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:11.460
you hear? I want an answer.

01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.186
- Objection.
- Watch it, counselor.

01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:15.940
I'm trying very hard, Judge.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.665
Try harder, counselor.

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.420
It seems basic to
our constitutional principles

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:29.829
that the extent
of the right to assemble,

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.260
and demonstrate and march

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.020
along the highway in a peaceful manner

01:44:34.120 --> 01:44:35.740
ought to be commensurate

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.020
with the enormity of the wrongs

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:40.951
that are being protested
and petitioned against.

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:46.308
In this case, the wrongs are enormous.

01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:49.906
Therefore,

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.020
the extent of the right to demonstrate

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:57.702
in an estimated five-day march
from Selma to Montgomery

01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:00.064
has been approved accordingly.

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:02.342
- Yes!
- Thank God!

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.780
There's no further business
with this court.

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:10.701
These proceedings are concluded,
with our thanks to the litigants.

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:13.829
Good day, gentlemen.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.180
Yeah, that's right.

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:33.060
Well, now, we don't like
to have no mistakes, if you...

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.421
If you're sure about it.

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:39.020
Bayard says that Harry says
he can get Nina Simone,

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:43.350
Dick Gregory, Joan Baez,
Peter, Paul and Mary in.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.780
Come on now.
We don't got money for that.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:48.380
Well, Harry is chartering
a plane himself.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:51.550
Day-O, day-O

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:56.220
Daylight come and me wan' go home

01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:01.790
President's angling for your blocking
of the march to be overturned.

01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.940
Unfortunately, all my maneuvers
have been put on hold

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.984
while the matter's being adjudicated.

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.740
Governor, you wanted to talk.

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:20.947
Well, Mr. President...

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:27.388
Malcontents are disrupting Alabama,
and it's your responsibility to stop them.

01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:30.700
They're protesting
about the right to vote

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:34.140
and the way they're treated
in your state.

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:38.380
So that's your problem,
your responsibility,

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.582
and it's on your watch.

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.308
Mr. President, I disagree.

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:47.220
We have a certain way things are done.
It's the way it is.

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:49.582
And it's the way
the people want it to stay.

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:53.900
George, why are you doing this?

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.900
Your whole career
has been working for the poor.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.784
Why are you off on this black thing?

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.951
Well, 'cause you can't
ever satisfy them.

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:03.740
First, it's the front seat of the bus.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:06.500
Next, it's take over the parks,

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:10.989
then it's the public schools,
then it's voting, then it's jobs,

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.469
then it's distribution of wealth
without work.

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.900
George, you seen all those demonstrators

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.300
out front of the White House

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.580
keeping my Lady Bird awake
the whole damn night?

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:24.620
Oh, yes, Mr. President. I saw them.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.580
Well, let's go out there, you and I,

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.421
and announce that you've decided to
let the blacks vote undeterred,

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.460
and this whole mess will go away.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:36.630
And I don't have to draft bills
or force the issue.

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:39.780
Now, why don't we do that, George?

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:42.824
Why don't you just let the niggers vote?

01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.700
You agree they got
the right to vote, don't you?

01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:47.620
There's no quarrel with that.

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.902
I know that. That's the law.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:52.663
Then why don't you just let 'em vote?

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:55.700
I don't have that power.
It belongs to the county registrars.

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:58.790
Now, don't shit me
about who runs Alabama.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.460
I don't have any legal power

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:04.470
over the county registrars,
Mr. President.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.822
They have their regulations
and they adhere.

01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:10.180
Are you trying to shit me,
George Wallace?

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.540
Are you trying
to fuck over your President?

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:13.820
Mr. President...

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.140
We shouldn't even
be thinking about 1965.

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:19.071
We should be thinking about 1985.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:21.908
You and I'll be
both dead and gone by then.

01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:25.140
In 1985, what do you want looking back?

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:26.980
You want people remembering you sayin',

01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:31.629
"Wait," or "I can't,"
or, "It's too hard"?

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.460
I don't right care what they think,

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:40.027
and you shouldn't neither.

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.021
Well...

01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:49.460
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let history

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.028
put me in the same place
as the likes of you.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:00.143
I speak tonight for the dignity of man

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:03.903
and the destiny of democracy.

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:07.980
At times, history and fate

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.071
meet at a single time in a single place.

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:18.227
So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:22.544
There, long suffering men and women

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:28.380
peacefully protested the denial
of their rights as Americans.

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:30.620
Rarely in any time

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:34.222
does an issue lay bare the secret heart

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.988
of America itself.

01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.380
The issue for equal rights
for the American Negro

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.423
is that issue.

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:46.266
For this issue,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.786
many of them were brutally assaulted.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.023
There is no Negro problem.
There is no Southern problem.

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:02.784
There is only an American problem.

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.660
The Constitution says that

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:12.300
no person shall be kept from voting

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.151
because of his race or color.

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.260
To correct the denial
of this fundamental right,

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:24.860
this Wednesday,
I will send to Congress a law

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.145
designed to eliminate
these illegal barriers.

01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.980
The bill will strike down

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.820
voting restrictions in all elections,

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:39.741
federal, state and local.

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:43.468
And we shall do this.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:48.828
We shall overcome.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.460
We believe we can cover you
through Lowndes County,

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:12.140
but once we add the final day's march
through Montgomery,

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:14.860
and you're passing through
all those tall buildings and whatnot,

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:17.028
coverage becomes challenging.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:21.101
So please consider

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:23.700
driving in on the final leg.

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:27.461
And please consider nixing
the speech at the Capitol.

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.740
Well, if Wallace will see us
when we arrive,

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.022
there'll be no need for a speech.

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.984
Can you arrange that?

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:44.071
I can't hide.

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.385
We can't hide. You understand.

01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:54.951
I don't want to see this
go wrong for you.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:59.747
Don't you want
to protect yourself, Doctor?

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.582
Let me try to do that.

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.540
You know, I know you want to live to see

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:10.141
the fruits of all this work.
I know you do.

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:16.860
I'm just asking you to allow us
to help you do that.

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:27.060
I'm no different than anybody else.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.865
I want to live long and be happy.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:37.422
But I'll not be focusing
on what I want today.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.501
I'm focused on what God wants.

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:49.263
We're here for a reason,
through many, many storms.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.220
But, today, the sun is shining,
and I'm about to stand in its warmth

01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:01.823
alongside a lot of freedom-loving people
who worked hard to get us here.

01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:07.310
I may not be with them
for all the sunny days to come,

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:12.304
but as long as there
is light ahead for them,

01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:16.223
it's worth it to me.

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.310
Thank you, John.

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:15.504
We heard them say
we'd never make it here.

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:21.982
We heard them say they'd stop us,
if it was the last thing they did.

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.985
We heard them say
we don't deserve to be here.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:34.030
But today, we stand as Americans.

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:39.350
We are here,

01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:43.383
and we ain't gonna let nobody
turn us around.

01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:47.351
This mighty march,

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.340
which will be counted
as one of the greatest

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.260
demonstrations of protest and progress,

01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.980
ends here in the Capitol ofAlabama

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:00.262
for a vital purpose.

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:04.940
We have not fought only
for the right to sit where we please

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:08.100
and go to school where we please.

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:12.510
We do not only strive here today
to vote as we please.

01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:15.300
But with our commitment,

01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:19.540
we give birth each day to a new energy

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:23.301
that is stronger than
our strongest opposition.

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.740
And we embrace
this new energy so boldly,

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:31.260
embody it so fervently,

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:34.623
that its reflection illuminates
a great darkness.

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:40.788
Our society has distorted who we are.

01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:44.631
From slavery to the Reconstruction

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.300
to the precipice at which we now stand,

01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:54.303
we have seen powerful
white men rule the world

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:59.621
while offering poor white men
a vicious lie as placation.

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.500
And when the poor white man's children

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:07.182
wail with a hunger
that cannot be satisfied,

01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.387
he feeds them that same vicious lie.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.821
A lie whispering to them

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:17.701
that regardless of their lot in life,

01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.100
they can at least be triumphant
in the knowledge

01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:27.101
that their whiteness makes
them superior to blackness.

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:29.070
But we know the truth.

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:35.626
We know the truth, and we will
go forward to that truth, to freedom.

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.629
We will not be stopped.

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.990
We will march for our rights.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:48.700
We will march to demand
treatment as full citizens.

01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:52.460
We will march until the viciousness
and the darkness

01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:56.028
gives way to the light of righteousness.

01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:00.580
No man, no myth,

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:04.980
no malaise will stop this movement.

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:09.740
We forbid it.
For we know that it is this darkness

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:14.104
that murders the best in us
and the best of us.

01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:19.420
Whether Jimmie Lee Jackson
or James Reeb,

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:24.462
or four blameless little girls

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:28.830
struck down before they had even begun.

01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:35.420
You may ask, when will we
be free of this darkness?

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.146
I say to you today,
my brothers and sisters,

01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:41.700
despite the pain, despite the tears,

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:44.426
our freedom will soon be upon us.

01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:51.629
For "truth crushed to earth
will rise again."

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:56.741
When will we be free?

01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.860
Soon, and very soon.

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.348
Because you shall reap what you sow.

01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:08.750
When will we be free?

01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:11.902
Soon, and very soon.

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.590
Because no lie can live forever.

01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:21.180
When will we be free?

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.580
Soon, and very soon

01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:26.300
because "Mine eyes have seen

01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:29.220
"the glory of the coming of the Lord.

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:31.500
"He is trampling out the vintage

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:33.900
"where the grapes of wrath are stored.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.900
"He hath loosed the fateful lightning

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.140
"of his terrible swift sword.

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:40.340
"His truth is marching on.

01:59:40.440 --> 01:59:47.079
"Glory! Hallelujah!

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:50.389
"His truth is marching on."
