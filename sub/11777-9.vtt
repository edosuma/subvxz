eight artists were left

00:13.012 --> 00:16.265
You all complete

00:16.349 --> 00:17.684

{\an5}-Whoa.

00:25.316 --> 00:25.608
-Yeah.

I am hauling ass.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.458
Holy [bleep].

00:41.541 --> 00:43.960
We had a tattoo
at the same time.

00:44.043 --> 00:46.337
And we got beaten like
[bleep] stepchildren.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.631

<i>At the elimination,</i>
<i>Clint, Sarah and Mark</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:52.385
<i>were the bottom three.</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:54.345
Mark.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.973
The gradation inside the armor
is really weak.

00:57.056 --> 00:57.682
I hate to see you down here
in the bottom again.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.226
How many passes do you get?

01:00.310 --> 01:01.644
Sarah and Clint.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.771
You guys didn't
work well together at all.

01:02.854 --> 01:06.191
Your anatomy is off.
Your designs are just flawed.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.942
I have passion
and I'll continue to fight.

01:08.026 --> 01:12.030
I'm not done.
Don't count me out.

01:12.113 --> 01:15.366
Mark, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.328
<i>Seven artists remain,</i>

01:18.411 --> 01:22.832
<i>but only one will</i>
<i>earn a $100,000 prize.</i>

<i>And the title of Ink Master.</i>

01:31.382 --> 01:35.970
[rock music]

02:21.224 --> 02:23.726
If you give me
honest, solid critique,

02:23.810 --> 02:25.520
I appreciate that critique.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.564
And I will take that
and I will learn from that.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.607
I am a really good artist
and I have passion.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.859
I love what I do.

02:30.942 --> 02:34.320
And I'll continue
to push myself.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.407
You'll see it from me
maybe tomorrow, maybe a month,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.450
or maybe a year from now,
but you'll see it.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.077
But there's a lot
of design flaws.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.872
{\an5}-It came out lacking.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.872
-I'm not done.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.667
How you take critiques
and your emotions--

02:47.750 --> 02:49.252
but I've proven
this entire competition

02:49.335 --> 02:52.380
that I take what they say
and I do better work.

02:52.463 --> 02:53.089
That's not what I'm saying.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.383
{\an8}Sarah is a very big know-it-all.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.553
<i>She comes on very strong</i>
<i>with her emotions.</i>

02:58.636 --> 02:59.762
It's kind of annoying.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.431
Ripped me a new [bleep]-hole
and, like, I'd be, like,

03:01.514 --> 03:02.432
"Thank you, sirs."

03:02.515 --> 03:04.601
You know you
put 110% into everything.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.102
{\an5}-Yes.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.102
-So who cares?

03:06.185 --> 03:06.936
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.900
I live tattoos.
I love tattooing.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.652
{\an8}Sarah handles pressure horribly.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.820
Oh, she is crazy.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.155
Her inexperience
in this competition

03:17.238 --> 03:20.366
is definitely
working against her.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.036
When it comes to critique,
you better put some skin on,

03:23.119 --> 03:25.204
'cause this [bleep]
is gonna [bleep] hurt.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.205
<i>I had a little bit</i>
<i>of a breakdown.</i>

03:26.289 --> 03:28.708
{\an8}But that's just gonna
make me work harder.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.170
Now they're gonna
see what I'm capable of.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.422
I'm gonna bring it.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.633
[rock music]

03:45.433 --> 03:46.225
Thanks, homie.

03:48.227 --> 03:51.105

03:48.227 --> 03:51.105
-Whoo!

03:51.189 --> 03:54.233
{\an5}-Yes!

03:51.189 --> 03:54.233
-[cheers and applause]

03:54.317 --> 03:55.652
All right!

03:55.735 --> 03:57.820
This is what I'm talking about.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.155
{\an8}What the [bleep] is going on?

04:01.240 --> 04:02.283
Ride that cow!

04:02.367 --> 04:03.660
<i>Riding is an</i> <i>understatement</i>

04:03.743 --> 04:05.203
{\an8}of what she's
doing to this bull.

04:07.246 --> 04:08.331
Seven artists remain,

04:08.414 --> 04:11.417
but only one will walk away
with $100,000,

04:11.501 --> 04:13.586
a feature article
in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

04:13.670 --> 04:16.172
and most importantly,
the title of Ink Master.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.341
As always, we begin
with the Flash Challenge.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.552
The skills test that will
give the winner the power

04:21.636 --> 04:23.054
to assign all
the human canvasses

04:23.137 --> 04:24.973
for the elimination tattoo.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.643
This week, we're
testing balance.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.020
Everything from incorporating
multiple elements

04:31.104 --> 04:32.021
into one design,

04:32.105 --> 04:33.690
the arrangement
of those elements,

04:33.773 --> 04:36.150
and the placement
of the elements on the body.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.193
<i>Balance is really important</i>

04:37.276 --> 04:39.696
{\an8}because it means you have
a good fluidity.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.156
It helps move your eye around
and it doesn't

04:42.240 --> 04:44.075
get hung up on one place.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.994
For today's Flash Challenge,

04:46.077 --> 04:48.705
you've each been
randomly assigned a cowgirl.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.708
Instead of tattooing skin,
you'll be burning chaps.

04:51.791 --> 04:52.458
[laughing]

04:54.627 --> 04:55.586
{\an8}What are chaps?

04:56.587 --> 04:57.714
<i>I don't know</i> <i>who invented</i>
<i>chaps,</i>

04:57.797 --> 05:00.091
{\an8}but man, I gotta
shake his [bleep] hand.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.468
Remember, you're
being judged on balance.

05:02.552 --> 05:03.386
If the elements
don't work together

05:03.469 --> 05:05.888
and aren't well-placed
on the chaps,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.016
you're headed for a fall.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.018
You have two hours to
customize and design

05:10.101 --> 05:12.645
and burn it into their chaps.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.440
And your time begins now.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.275
[music]

05:18.234 --> 05:19.318
{\an8}In testing balance,
we want to see them

05:19.402 --> 05:22.739
incorporate multiple
elements of the design together.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.615
It just needs
to fit the body shape.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.452
If it looks unbalanced,
it's just gonna look unnatural

05:27.535 --> 05:29.287
and overall unpleasing.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.875
I've never seen
one of these before.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.252
What do we have in mind?

05:36.335 --> 05:39.338
I was thinking maybe something
aquatic, tropical. Sharks.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.465
You got any ideas?

05:40.548 --> 05:43.593
{\an5}-How about mythical dragons.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.593
-Dragon, huh?

05:43.676 --> 05:44.761
You want to keep
the Texas theme, like,

05:44.844 --> 05:47.013
why don't we do,
like, bull skulls?

05:47.096 --> 05:47.972
Cool.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.265
{\an8}I was on the bottom
for the first time.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.100
I don't like the way that felt.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.770
I have to kick my ass in gear
and just push myself,

05:53.853 --> 05:56.147
just to get over this roadblock.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.399
{\an8}I definitely feel that
I've been very underestimated.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.235
I don't feel like anybody
saw me as a threat.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.029
And I think that
that changed now

06:03.112 --> 06:04.572
with how I've been climbing up.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.533
[rock music]

06:07.617 --> 06:08.951
Let's see how well
you can burn some [bleep].

06:09.035 --> 06:10.453
Oh, yeah, this is hot.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.917
It burns pretty easy.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.460
All right, guys,
it's one hour down.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.878
You got one hour to go.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.172
[music]

06:24.884 --> 06:26.969
{\an8}It's really hard for me
to bounce back from last week,

06:27.053 --> 06:28.429
{\an8}just 'cause of the fact
that I felt like

06:28.513 --> 06:30.139
{\an8}I didn't deserve
to go in the bottom.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.766
Would you say
that you did gradation

06:31.849 --> 06:32.975
as nice as the rest
of the field?

06:33.059 --> 06:34.185
I have to stand
by the fact that I--

06:34.268 --> 06:36.521
You can't. 'Cause you didn't.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.982
I got exactly the opposite
of what I felt I deserved.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.027
How you doing?

06:43.111 --> 06:45.863
{\an8}I really can't say that
Clint's piece shows balance.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.366
<i>Pretty ballsy move</i>
<i>trying to do a three-headed</i>

06:48.449 --> 06:51.119

<i>in front of Nunez.</i>

06:55.331 --> 06:57.542
[music]

06:58.918 --> 07:00.253
The balance of love and hate.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.380

little flames in his eyes.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.091
<i>We all know Jessie</i>
<i>is the biggest threat</i>

07:05.174 --> 07:06.134
{\an8}in this competition.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.469
Let's put little
nostrils in there.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.138
But he has to show
that he can do other styles.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.348
I'm a one-trick pony.

07:12.431 --> 07:14.100
<i>The judges don't think</i>
<i>his little googly eyes</i>

07:14.183 --> 07:15.309
are cute anymore.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.812
[bleep] Jesse
and your googly eyes.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.814
I'm not doing googly eyes.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.567
{\an5}-Those are googly eyes.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.567
-[bleep] Off.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.405
Look at you, learning
to deal with the scratches.

07:27.488 --> 07:30.366
{\an8}I really don't want to see any
of those smug little looks

07:30.449 --> 07:32.201
<i>that I know she's</i>
<i>been sending my way.</i>

07:32.285 --> 07:34.245
Baby is definitely more
of a threat to me right now.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.706
Oh, you frickin'
really drew in there.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.875
Look at you drawing skulls
from the top of your head.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.711
{\an5}-Don't even talk to me.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.711
-Oh, that is [bleep] up.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.505
{\an8}Sarah feels like she
is really competing with me.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.591
But I don't feel like Sarah
is better than me.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.884
We did just agree.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.553
<i>I can't let Tatu Baby</i>
<i>win this Flash Challenge.</i>

07:50.636 --> 07:52.722
{\an8}There's no room for error.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.142
You really want to give
yourself that mental anguish

07:56.225 --> 07:58.060
of making these things match?

07:58.144 --> 08:00.354
{\an8}Jamie takes on doing
two different chaps.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.481
You're out of your [bleep] mind.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.941
{\an8}It is a balance challenge,
so for me, I'm really trying

08:04.025 --> 08:07.403
<i>to show off where I think</i>
<i>that symmetrical sugar skulls</i>

08:07.486 --> 08:08.571
<i>would look good on a body.</i>

08:08.654 --> 08:10.698
I would love to win
a [bleep] Flash Challenge.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.074
At least one. God.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.618
It's definitely game-on.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.244
Five more minutes, everybody.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.122
It's looking pretty good, huh?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.583
{\an8}I am definitely feeling
a little bit more pressure.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.084
<i>I didn't come here to lose.</i>

08:22.168 --> 08:24.545
It's first place and then
all the rest are losers.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.089
And ten, nine, eight,

08:27.173 --> 08:30.927
seven, six, five, four,

08:31.010 --> 08:34.764
three, two, one.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.724
Time's up. No more burning.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.727
You look pretty cool.

08:42.145 --> 08:44.106
Tatu Baby,
tell us about this design.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.359
I knew that I wanted
to go with one side.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.236
And I wanted to show balance
through the music stuff,

08:48.319 --> 08:50.446
a microphone and some roses.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.240
I like the balance
of the design.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.699
It really rides the chap nicely.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.534
The writing at
the bottom narrows down.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.078
The design, it puts a nice flow.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.913
It's something that typically
you'd see on a nice layout

08:58.996 --> 09:00.081
of a tattoo.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.165
Thank you.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.459
Sarah, tell us
about this design.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.045
I wanted to utilize
both pant legs to show balance.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.797
I like the detail in the skull,

09:07.880 --> 09:11.425
but on the cactus leg
it looks unfinished.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.261
The balance of it,
it's a little bit right-heavy.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.136
'Cause that side just looks

09:14.220 --> 09:15.680
a little bit
too sketchy everywhere.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.641
Jesse.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.643
I like that you
utilized both legs.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.145
We came up with creatures
with teeth and big eyes.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.981
And then the love-hate concept,
so you have some balance there.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.191
You never sway.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.442
.You just keep doing what
you know you're gonna do,

09:28.526 --> 09:30.278
but I definitely
like the drawings.

09:30.361 --> 09:33.656
It does have a nice balance.
It's precise and it's solid.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.325
<i>Jesse's not making</i>
<i>any mistakes going new-school.</i>

09:36.409 --> 09:38.494
{\an8}That's what Jesse does
and if you give him the chance,

09:38.577 --> 09:40.413
<i>he's gonna do it right through</i>
<i>this [bleep] competition</i>

09:40.496 --> 09:41.664
and take that money.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.082
Steve.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.625
Going with just one leg
is really good.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.836
The way this fits the chap
from top to bottom,

09:46.919 --> 09:48.796
all the elements really
fit together nicely.

09:48.879 --> 09:49.964
I like the shark.

09:50.047 --> 09:50.965
I wish there was
more water in there

09:51.048 --> 09:53.301
to make the water stand out,
but technically

09:53.384 --> 09:54.677
you did a really good job.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.594
Thank you.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.096
Sebastian.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.681
The balance is a little bit off

09:58.764 --> 10:01.017
because it doesn't
have a clean outline.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.269
It just looks like
a pencil drawing in a notebook.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.979
It's just like doing
an outline in a tattoo.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.189
If the outline's clean,
the design looks clean.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.359
Jamie.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.694
I decided to try to do
just opposing sugar skulls

10:11.777 --> 10:14.780
that are similar, but with
different design elements,

10:14.864 --> 10:16.115
so they weren't just mirrored.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.867
I love the way
they fit on the hip,

10:17.950 --> 10:18.993
the balance between
each leg is right on.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.746
Your craftsmanship in this
shows in your tattooing.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.081
You lay it down in clean,
solid, bold outlines.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.416
You show it off.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.002
Clint.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.086
She said she wanted a dragon.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.298
Right out of the gate,
that's a backwards design.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.591
The head will be more
powerful-looking up and in.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.843
Dragons are supposed
to flow with the body.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.554
We talked about that too,
but I mean, the balance of it.

10:38.637 --> 10:39.555
The curves.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.724
The shape of the dragon
is very unbalanced.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.268
With one big claw.
It's just hideous.

10:46.187 --> 10:46.979
Let's start with Clint.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.647
You guys seemed
pretty rough on him.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.398
It didn't do anything
good to that chap.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.567
It didn't fit good on the leg.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.069
What about Sarah's Texas theme?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.196
Overall, weak.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.405
There were still pencil
sketching on the one side.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.533
We're catching a tailspin
out of some of our people now.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.660
If there was
a top in the field, Steve.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.080
Had a lot
of really solid, clean lines.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.207
With fine little details
on the flowers.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.792
It really made the design pop.

11:07.875 --> 11:11.087
Jesse did Jesse
on both legs of the chaps.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.506
If his execution would
have been as nice as Steve's,

11:13.589 --> 11:15.174
it would have been
a lot more bold.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.426
And it would have added
to his style of design.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.470
It was a cool concept
and it had a nice balance.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.596
He had a nice shape
that went along with that.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.932
{\an5}-Yeah.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.932
-Jamie did the two sugar skulls.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.141
I thought that was really tight.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.601
Two perfect sketches.
Clean, solid work.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.770
Fits the balance challenge.
Fits the chaps.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.564
{\an5}-Think we have a decision?

11:27.853 --> 11:30.564
-I think we agree.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.816
All right, man,
let's go tell them.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.821
For this Flash Challenge,
we tested you on balance.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.031
The judges have
come to a decision,

11:39.115 --> 11:41.117
and the winner
of this Flash Challenge is...

11:41.200 --> 11:43.786
[dramatic music]

11:44.120 --> 11:45.871
Jamie.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.040
[applause]

11:48.124 --> 11:49.208
{\an8}I don't [bleep] believe it.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.751
Yours stood out the most.
Very solid balance.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.463
Laid it down really clean.
You did nice, solid lines.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.714
You did a great job.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.426
You now have all the power
to assign the human canvasses

11:58.509 --> 12:00.010
for the elimination tattoo.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.138
I'm definitely motivated
to very strategically

12:02.221 --> 12:03.931
[bleep] Everyone.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.474
So head on back to the shop

12:05.558 --> 12:06.517
and get ready
to meet your canvasses

12:06.600 --> 12:09.019
for the next elimination tattoo.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.566
{\an8}Knock these [bleep] off
one by one.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.484
I refuse to be railroaded
by a canvas.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.570
I don't want to [bleep] go home.

12:17.653 --> 12:18.654
<i>If I don't like it,</i>
<i>I'm walking out.</i>

12:18.737 --> 12:20.322
This guy could very well
send me the [bleep] home.

12:20.406 --> 12:20.865
Start praying to Jesus.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.577
[music]

12:27.663 --> 12:29.832
It's a game, and I want
everyone to go home

12:29.915 --> 12:31.584
so we can finish
the [bleep] game.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.085
I just think
there are several people

12:33.169 --> 12:34.462
that aren't going to [bleep] up
no matter what they're given.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.630
Hand me what
you're gonna hand me

12:36.714 --> 12:38.841
and if I either sink or swim,
I sink or swim.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.010
<i>Throwing something at Jesse or</i>
<i>Steve is almost a wasted shot.</i>

12:41.093 --> 12:44.513
I'm within striking distance
of those guys anyway.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.639
Based off of the judges
and how many times

12:45.723 --> 12:47.683
people have been down there
and got reprimanded--

12:47.766 --> 12:49.018
{\an5}-I'd rather put Clint--

12:47.766 --> 12:49.018
-Clint.

12:49.101 --> 12:49.685
You know, Clint's
gotten a warning

12:49.768 --> 12:50.853
that he's right on the cusp.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.607
I think taking a swing
would be a smart thing to do.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.776
Somebody's gonna drop the ball,
but I'm not gonna [bleep] up.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.029
We don't know what
the challenges are,

13:00.112 --> 13:01.989
we don't know
what kind of [bleep] curves

13:02.072 --> 13:02.948
{\an5}-they're gonna throw at us.

13:02.072 --> 13:02.948
-And, you know,

13:03.032 --> 13:04.700
one bad day, one bad client.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.495
Knock these [bleep] off
one by one.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.248
[music]

13:11.332 --> 13:13.834
[needle buzzing]

13:21.467 --> 13:23.719
Welcome to another
elimination tattoo.

13:23.802 --> 13:26.430
This week,
we're testing balance.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.974
Impress us, and you'll have
another week to show us

13:29.058 --> 13:31.727
why you deserve
to be named Ink Master.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.897
Fail, and you'll be packing up
and heading home.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.858
Don't forget, you'll
be judged by all of America.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.444
Each week, viewers at home
will vote for the tattoo

13:40.528 --> 13:42.988
that they think is best,
using the same criteria

13:43.072 --> 13:44.156
that the judges use.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.201
But today, we also have
a very special guest judge.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.285
Oh, [bleep]. Here we go.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.537
He owns two of the most

13:49.620 --> 13:51.622
well-known tattoo shops
in the world.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.999
He's won hundreds of awards
for tattooing and art

13:54.083 --> 13:56.752
and is one of the leading
Japanese tattooers

13:56.835 --> 13:57.836
in the industry.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.089
Mike Rubendall.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.383
{\an5}-Oh, [bleep].

14:00.172 --> 14:02.383
-[applause]

14:02.466 --> 14:04.552
{\an8}I'm known for
my contemporary approach

14:04.635 --> 14:07.096
{\an8}on traditional
Japanese tattoo design.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.015
<i>The images have very</i>
<i>specific symbolism and rules</i>

14:10.099 --> 14:13.602
that tattooers need to follow
to stay true to the art form.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.938
{\an8}Mike Rubendall
is a living legend.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.233
Having Mike be a judge
on the panel is a chin-check

14:19.316 --> 14:20.526
for these tattooers.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.902
Thank you very much
for joining us, man.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.112
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.447
That brings us to this week's
elimination tattoo--

14:26.532 --> 14:27.283
Japanese.

14:27.366 --> 14:31.203
{\an8}Oh, [bleep] Japanese?
God damn it.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.623
{\an8}Every meaning on every
piece is going to be brought up.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.874
It has to be perfect
or we're screwed.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.002
Rooted in mythology
and natural symbols,

14:38.085 --> 14:41.338
Japanese tattoos convey
a balance of power and beauty

14:41.422 --> 14:43.966
through natural imagery.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.802
{\an8}In Japanese style there's
an even distribution of weight

14:46.885 --> 14:48.262
{\an8}throughout the piece.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.181
<i>If it's off, it can really make</i>
<i>somebody's body look awkward.</i>

14:51.265 --> 14:52.349
Let's meet your canvasses.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.102
[music]

14:59.898 --> 15:02.985
Today, we have
two Bellator fighters.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.696
{\an8}My name is Brett Weedman
and I'm a professional fighter.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.574
<i>I spent a bit of time in</i>
<i>Japan training in martial arts.</i>

15:08.657 --> 15:10.117
I wanted to have
something to represent

15:10.200 --> 15:11.327
that part of my life.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.455
<i>My name is Lloyd.</i>
<i>A lot of fighters have tattoos.</i>

15:14.538 --> 15:16.957
{\an8}I only have one on my back,
which is a cupcake.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.460
This will be my
first Japanese tattoo.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.003
I don't [bleep] believe this.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.588
{\an8}It's cupcake.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.965
I don't know what [bleep]
he wants, don't really care.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.050
That's the one I want to tattoo.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.385
Jamie, because you won
the Flash Challenge,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.513
you now have the power
to assign all human canvasses.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.349
You can upset the balance
of power.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.933
Be ruthless.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.769
<i>I consistently have gotten</i>
<i>the most difficult tattoo,</i>

15:36.852 --> 15:39.355
{\an8}time to switch it up a little.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.690
Thinking about a Koi
transforming into a dragon.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.400
I want to get rid
of the middle class.

15:43.484 --> 15:47.279
<i>Sarah, Clint and Sebastian, even</i>
<i>though they are falling behind,</i>

15:47.363 --> 15:49.531
they still have the potential
to do a really good tattoo

15:49.615 --> 15:50.574
and shine.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.243
I would hope to widen
the gap between myself

15:53.327 --> 15:54.286
and the middle people.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.580
I'd like a deity
on my right thigh.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.581
{\an5}-Anything in particular?

15:56.664 --> 15:57.581
-Yes.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.334
{\an5}-It's called a Daruma Doll.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.334
-All right.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.169
-I'm open on the right leg.
-No particular ideas?

16:02.252 --> 16:07.341
Anything that spells fighting
or is bad-ass, I'm into.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.008
{\an5}-Okay.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.008
-A dragon.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.052
<i>Jamie's gunning for me.</i>

16:10.135 --> 16:12.596
{\an8}I came after his [bleep],
so he's gonna come after mine.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.055
I know I'm [bleep].

16:15.516 --> 16:18.060
Canvasses. One by one,
please reveal the name

16:18.143 --> 16:19.228
on the bottom of your skull.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.522
Tatu Baby.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.856
Jamie.

16:22.940 --> 16:23.941
Steve.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.150
<i>I get the muscle guy.</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:28.404
{\an8}He wants a Koi Dragon,
which I am not a big fan of.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.863
This could be a really
[bleep] up tattoo.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.282
{\an5}-Sarah.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.282
-Sebastian.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.617
Yes.

16:33.701 --> 16:34.910
{\an8}I actually got the canvass
that I wanted to have.

16:34.993 --> 16:35.494
Thanks a lot, buddy.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.955
{\an5}-Jesse.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.955
-Clint.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.333
I [bleep] Clint over
by giving him a dragon again

16:41.417 --> 16:42.710
after he got chewed up so bad
on the chaps.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.421
<i>My most brilliant move to date.</i>

16:45.504 --> 16:46.797
{\an8}Fan-[bleep]-tastic.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.132
{\an8}Thanks, dude.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.093
You have the rest
of the evening to consult

16:51.176 --> 16:52.219
with your human canvass.

16:52.302 --> 16:55.139
Tomorrow, you'll have
six hours to complete

16:55.222 --> 16:56.390
your Japanese tattoo.

16:56.473 --> 17:00.102
And based on your work,
one of you will be closing shop.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.770
Good luck.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.565
<i>When it comes</i>
<i>to doing true Japanese,</i>

17:04.647 --> 17:06.442
{\an8}everything is very deliberate.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.278
<i>From the background</i>
<i>to the way things line up</i>

17:09.361 --> 17:11.905
<i>to the placement on the body,</i>
<i>they have to be perfect</i>

17:11.989 --> 17:14.157
in order to pull off
a rhythm and a balance.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.200
I saw the Bellator straight up,
I'm like, "I know him!"

17:17.869 --> 17:18.871
{\an8}I'm ready for this challenge.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.123
I should have the best
tattoo I've ever done now.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.540
Um, while you're
looking through this,

17:22.624 --> 17:24.041
why don't you tell me real quick
what you had in mind.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.880
And I'm gonna let you know
what we can do.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.048
Since we're gonna be
doing obviously a dragon,

17:30.132 --> 17:31.633
we're working against
a lot of detail

17:31.717 --> 17:32.926
with a limited
amount of time, so...

17:33.010 --> 17:36.138
{\an8}I have absolutely no experience
with Japanese tattoos at all.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.265
If you want me
to cover a lot of area,

17:38.348 --> 17:40.184
line gray would
be a good route to go.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.393
I was hoping in color.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.562
What I can get done
in six hours in black-and-gray,

17:43.645 --> 17:45.063
is about the same
as 3.5 hours in color.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.483
So you're basically
cutting it in half.

17:47.566 --> 17:49.526
It can't get any worse
for me than this.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.653
I'm looking for reddish and
yellows and golds, greenish.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.947
This is an ass-beating

17:54.031 --> 17:57.117
that could very well
be my ticket home.

17:57.201 --> 17:57.993
I mean, I love the idea
of the lotus.

17:58.076 --> 18:01.205
It just--if there's
other flowers.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.791
Flora's more like an accent

18:03.874 --> 18:05.334
{\an5}-to a piece.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.334
-Right. Right.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.336
You always need
that subject matter.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.671
Let's think of something cool
that we can incorporate.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.007
{\an5}-How about a Koi Fish?

18:09.755 --> 18:12.007
-Mm...

18:12.090 --> 18:12.841
{\an5}-You don't like Koi Fish?

18:12.090 --> 18:12.841
-Not really.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.051
I would rather go floral.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.345
Would you be into,
like, a Buddha?

18:16.428 --> 18:17.179
I don't think--

18:17.262 --> 18:18.347
you're not crazy
about the Buddha.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.808
I'm just thinking
competition-wise, you know?

18:20.891 --> 18:23.143
{\an8}There's nothing in this
tattoo that I can put

18:23.227 --> 18:24.853
{\an8}that's gonna wow the judges.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.897
I know that if I put totally
different flowers together,

18:26.980 --> 18:29.316
it's probably gonna hurt me.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.401
I don't want this tattoo
to look simple.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.111
Now you're giving me
a tricky one.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.365
We're gonna do
some extensive research.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.366
Absolutely.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.243
And we're gonna
get this [bleep] perfect.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.204
D-a-r-u-m-a doll.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.289
He has a weight in the bottom
of him, so if you were to

18:44.373 --> 18:45.541
push him over,
he would bounce back up.

18:45.624 --> 18:49.127
{\an8}I just don't see the doll
as being a traditional tattoo.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.922
<i>I really don't want to get</i>
<i>my ass chewed out for that.</i>

18:52.005 --> 18:53.298
{\an5}-You definitely want that?

18:52.005 --> 18:53.298
-I had my mind set.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.134
We're talking about my father
coming home from Japan

18:56.218 --> 18:57.678
with one of these,
and I'm seven.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.222
And he's teaching me these
life lessons with this doll.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.723
{\an5}-Right.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.723
-So to say, like,

19:01.807 --> 19:04.309
"well, this one's aesthetically
more Japanese for this challenge

19:04.393 --> 19:06.061
{\an5}-on this show--

19:04.393 --> 19:06.061
-Not aesthetically.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.229
He did not want
to change anything.

19:07.312 --> 19:13.318
We have two judges that
specialize in Japanese tattoos.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.697
<i>I know that she's looking</i>
<i>to please the judges,</i>

19:16.780 --> 19:18.240
{\an8}but first thing is pleasing me

19:18.323 --> 19:19.241
{\an8}and make sure that
I get the tattoo that I want.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.077
I don't want to use
a Japanese element,

19:22.160 --> 19:23.912
like, just because
it's an element,

19:23.996 --> 19:26.665
but it doesn't have any personal
connection to my time in Japan.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.918
{\an8}I completely refuse to
be railroaded by a canvass.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.545
I need to meet this challenge,

19:31.628 --> 19:32.170
and I don't want
to [bleep] go home.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.761
[rock music]

19:43.724 --> 19:44.892
{\an5}-This is your piece?

19:43.724 --> 19:44.892
-Yeah.

19:44.975 --> 19:47.311
What do you think?
You like it? No?

19:48.020 --> 19:48.270
Wow, that's a lot.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.899
Clint, are you doing yours
black-and-gray or in color?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.942
I'm doing it in black-and-gray.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.320
I just hope you
can do it in six hours.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.446
[scoffs]

19:57.529 --> 19:59.948
Looks like Clint's
bit off the most.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.992
I feel like giving Clint the
dragon was really well played.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.536
He's definitely struggling.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.245
[sighs]

20:07.372 --> 20:10.417
Today you must create
a Japanese tattoo.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.337
Remember, we're
testing you on balance.

20:13.420 --> 20:18.926
You have six hours to tattoo
and your time starts now.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.344
{\an5}-Yeah, man.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.344
-Let's do it.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.387
{\an8}Balance is a major
element in Japanese tattooing.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.849
It's really important to balance
the image to background.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.060
Cool, cool, cool.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.394
And the overall way
images move on the body.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.065
{\an5}-Sorry if my feet smell.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.065
-Nah, you're good. You're good.

20:33.148 --> 20:36.193
Yeah. I like that a great deal.

20:36.276 --> 20:38.111
<i>Even if it does cost me,</i>

20:38.195 --> 20:40.614
{\an8}I'm going to do
the Daruma Doll for him.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.741
I really want to just
kind of capture your story.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.327
'Cause I mean, that's what the
original Japanese tattoos were,

20:45.410 --> 20:48.038
they were a culmination
of a person's life events.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.331
Right.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.084
<i>This Daruma Doll has so</i>
<i>much meaning to me personally.</i>

20:52.167 --> 20:54.544
I feel like I keep
getting knocked down,

20:54.628 --> 20:55.963
the harshest critiques.

20:56.046 --> 20:56.964
Every single time
I get knocked down,

20:57.047 --> 20:59.299
I push myself back up.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.634
It looks fantastic.

21:01.510 --> 21:01.843
[needle buzzing]

21:01.927 --> 21:04.513
Here we go.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.430
Now you definitely
gotta be still.

21:06.848 --> 21:07.265
Oh, my God.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.146
{\an8}I think my design
is the [bleep].

21:13.230 --> 21:16.024
The entire tattoo as
a whole is balanced.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.526
{\an5}-But he's moving.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.526
-[shrieks]

21:17.609 --> 21:19.361
And I need to finish the lines.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.029
I was moving? All right.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.030
You see where your arm was
and where it is?

21:22.114 --> 21:24.825
Well, man, you
wanna tie me down?

21:24.908 --> 21:25.867
I don't know, we might have to.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.704
I'm a little concerned
I might just [bleep] up

21:28.787 --> 21:31.039
and not be able to [bleep]
finish the tattoo.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.375
{\an5}-[groans]

21:31.123 --> 21:33.375
-[needle buzzing]

21:33.458 --> 21:36.044
My balls are
on the band saw right now.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.464
{\an8}This type of tattoo
requires a lot of time.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.299
It's so tight with detail.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.052
{\an5}-[grunts]

21:41.383 --> 21:44.052
-I need to adjust.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.887
I'm not trying to be a dick
or anything, it's just, like,

21:45.971 --> 21:47.556
[bleep], can we at least
get the dragon done?

21:47.639 --> 21:49.391
[sighs]

21:52.060 --> 21:53.228
No.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.731
I just happened to land a client
who's not allowing me to do

21:55.814 --> 21:57.149
the best of my ability.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.859
If I don't like it,
I'm walking out.

21:58.942 --> 22:00.694
This guy could very well
send me the [bleep] home.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.154
Start praying to Jesus.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.366
[buzzing]

22:08.368 --> 22:10.037
The fish should dye perfect.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.246
<i>To make this tattoo</i>
<i>really shine,</i>

22:11.329 --> 22:14.166
{\an8}I'm throwing different elements
and having these elements

22:14.249 --> 22:15.500
balance out with each other,

22:15.584 --> 22:18.003
even though they're
not symmetrical.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.964
I love the way that the color's
coming out in the layout.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.132
And the layout.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.258
I'm not 100% confident
with this,

22:23.341 --> 22:26.011
I just hope it
doesn't send me home.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.054
[grunts]

22:27.137 --> 22:27.721
Three more hours.

22:27.804 --> 22:31.224
[buzzing]

22:32.434 --> 22:33.727
[grunts]

22:33.810 --> 22:35.270
Do you know what
the Koi symbolizes?

22:35.353 --> 22:37.814
{\an8}I didn't know there was
gonna be a Goddamn test.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.567
It symbolizes
quite a few things, um...

22:40.650 --> 22:42.277
It symbolizes courage.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.904
<i>I did a reasonable</i>
<i>amount of homework.</i>

22:43.987 --> 22:46.740
Honestly, there was, like,
100 meanings for Koi Fish.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.408
Oh, it's gonna be
a bloodbath out there.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.412
Knowing that the judges
might get on my case

22:52.496 --> 22:54.456
about the doll itself--

22:54.539 --> 22:55.707
Look at that.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.459
I decide to put other elements
in the background.

22:57.542 --> 23:01.338
<i>That are going to support</i>
<i>the Daruma.</i>

23:01.421 --> 23:03.256
What do you think about Sarah's?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.717
The background is competing
against the image.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.385
It's very tough
to decipher the two.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.139
Yo, yo, yo. What's going on?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.390
What's the haps?

23:12.474 --> 23:14.142
Talk about being nervous
about American traditional,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.978
now it's, like, "Oh, my God."

23:17.062 --> 23:18.188
It's only me and Rubendahl,
don't worry.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.148
Yeah, no pressure.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.735
<i>Because Sebastian</i>
<i>did the background so dark,</i>

23:23.819 --> 23:26.655
it looks like a turd
that you can't polish.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.824
Well, you know if you say
something bad about this tattoo

23:28.907 --> 23:29.866
I'm coming for you, right?

23:29.950 --> 23:32.369
I don't give a [bleep].
Punch ain't gonna hurt.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.829
I won't even see it coming.
I'll be done.

23:33.912 --> 23:34.996
Oh, I know.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.082
Two more hours.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.085
{\an5}-Hey.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.085
-Oh, yeah.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.338
{\an8}I've never actually done
a real Japanese piece.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.632
{\an5}-This stuff's kind of fun.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.632
-You think?

23:45.715 --> 23:47.134
Yeah. It's liberating.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.010
<i>This particular challenge,</i>
<i>I've decided to put</i>

23:49.094 --> 23:51.304
my personality aside
to create this piece,

23:51.388 --> 23:53.682
<i>so I can show the judges</i>
<i>that I respect what they do.</i>

23:53.765 --> 23:55.934
How different is that drawing
than what he draws.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.228
It's, like, "No."

23:58.311 --> 24:00.856
If I start putting googly eyes
on this horse and buck teeth

24:00.939 --> 24:04.234
on the Samurai chick,
I know for a fact

24:04.317 --> 24:06.153
that Chris would
flip his [bleep].

24:06.236 --> 24:08.363
Try to put some traditional
feel in there for you.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.782
Even though Jesse's
a new school kid,

24:10.866 --> 24:12.409
he's hung around this long
because his technique

24:12.492 --> 24:15.787
and his application
are top notch.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.789
Hang in there.

24:18.790 --> 24:22.794
{\an5}-What are you doing?

24:18.790 --> 24:22.794
-Making a Koi dragon.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.714
A Koi dragon literally looks
like the body of a Koi Fish

24:25.797 --> 24:27.215
and the head of a dragon.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.009
Kind of looks like a seahorse
a little bit.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.011
He wanted more of a dragon
than a Koi. Right?

24:31.094 --> 24:32.721
Right.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.222
<i>I'm kind of handcuffed</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

24:34.306 --> 24:36.391
{\an8}The judges are two
traditional tattoo artists,

24:36.474 --> 24:39.561
<i>most Koi Dragons are 90% fish</i>
<i>with a dragon head,</i>

24:39.644 --> 24:41.897
but my client didn't really
want to go old school.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.482
I understand what they said
but you want a longer tail.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.943
I gave you a longer tail.
You're the customer, man.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.737
I like it, I really do.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.113
[buzzing]

24:50.197 --> 24:53.366
20 minutes left.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.662
[grunts]

24:59.623 --> 25:02.626
I decide that I'm gonna
basically almost double

25:02.709 --> 25:04.336
the size of my tattoo
and try to throw some

25:04.419 --> 25:05.921
<i>lotus's on there really quick.</i>

25:06.004 --> 25:08.256
Not my brightest moment.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.133
Time is [bleep] flying today.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.593
You did it. You added the lotus.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.512
Probably something else
I'm gonna get yelled at for.

25:16.014 --> 25:19.517
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

25:19.601 --> 25:22.687
six, five, four,

25:22.771 --> 25:25.523
three, two, one.

25:25.607 --> 25:29.319
That's it, time's up.
No more ink, machine's down.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.906
Worth six hours of torture, huh?

25:32.989 --> 25:34.658
I definitely am
questioning my sanity

25:34.741 --> 25:37.911
for sticking these lotuses
on there at the last second.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.955
<i>Up close it's</i>
<i>really rough still.</i>

25:40.038 --> 25:41.414
It definitely needs more time.

25:43.041 --> 25:43.959
Clint's piece might
just save my ass.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.836
It looks like he
shot his dragon in the head

25:46.920 --> 25:47.671
and beat it to death
for six hours.

25:49.881 --> 25:50.882
<i>There were a lot</i>
<i>of issues with it,</i>

25:50.966 --> 25:52.092
{\an8}it's very, very dark.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.802
The fire looks like a red blob.
I'm one pissed off guy.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.887
[exhales]

25:55.971 --> 25:57.847
This is by far
the worst canvas I've had.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.809
That [bleep] completely
[bleep] me on my tattoo

26:00.892 --> 26:02.143
and I'm [bleep] pissed.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.271
[grunts]

26:04.354 --> 26:05.730
{\an8}Do not bring up your client,

26:05.814 --> 26:06.898
{\an8}'cause they
do not give a [bleep].

26:06.982 --> 26:08.149
{\an8}But you can't force your client

26:08.233 --> 26:09.192
{\an8}to get something else.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.152
{\an8}No, wrong. You're gonna
get your ass chewed out.

26:11.236 --> 26:12.487
{\an8}Hell no. [bleep] that.

26:12.570 --> 26:15.991
I mean, this thing
is a [bleep] mess.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.118
What the [bleep]
is anybody here for

26:18.201 --> 26:19.911
if they can only do
on style of tattooing?

26:21.413 --> 26:23.540
[music]

26:25.542 --> 26:28.044
I don't think
I did an amazing tattoo,

26:28.128 --> 26:30.839
'cause my client didn't let me
put anything else on it.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.508
What I would say to you is,
do not bring up your client

26:33.591 --> 26:34.884
'cause they do not
give a [bleep].

26:34.968 --> 26:37.554
But you can't force your
client to get something else.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.264
I understand that.
What I'm saying to you is

26:39.347 --> 26:40.223
all the judges look at it,

26:40.307 --> 26:42.350
that's an excuse,
they don't [bleep] care.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.727
But my client
did not want nothing else.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.644
But what I'm telling you
is the judges--

26:44.728 --> 26:45.520
They're gonna
do it somewhere else.

26:45.603 --> 26:48.606
But you cannot
tattoo anything extra

26:48.690 --> 26:50.483
on your client because
your client's gonna be, like,

26:50.567 --> 26:51.609
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop."

26:51.693 --> 26:54.029
No. Wrong. You're gonna
get your ass chewed out.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.322
Hell, no. [bleep] that.

26:56.656 --> 27:00.076
<i>I don't think Baby sees the</i>
<i>negative things in her tattoos.</i>

27:00.160 --> 27:02.871
{\an8}If you can't admit to yourself,
"well, there are some things

27:02.954 --> 27:03.788
that I need to work on,"

27:03.872 --> 27:05.707
you will never
be able to improve.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.837
[music]

27:22.974 --> 27:27.062
This week, we asked you
to create a Japanese tattoo.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.396
We were testing balance.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.274
Jamie, you're up first.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.780
Are you familiar
with doing Japanese style?

27:36.863 --> 27:37.947
You know, maybe
an Americanized-Japanese,

27:38.031 --> 27:41.659
but definitely I wouldn't
say traditional Japanese.

27:41.743 --> 27:42.660
Let's start with
the positive sides.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.871
I like the fins you did.
I like the texture.

27:44.954 --> 27:48.166
And all the veins that you
put in the fins, you know,

27:48.249 --> 27:49.167
to give it that nice look to it.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.087
The flowers in this
thing are killing me.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.505
I've gotten to know
your tattoo style.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.840
I've gotten to see how clean
of an outline you can do.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.926
{\an5}-They were rushed.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.926
-The outlines were jacked.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.386
I honestly thought
I had plenty of time

27:59.469 --> 28:01.513
and once I got into them it was
the fasted six hours of my life.

28:01.596 --> 28:02.889
To be honest,
I think you could have

28:02.972 --> 28:04.432
eliminated them completely
and spent more time

28:04.516 --> 28:06.935
on the Koi and the waves.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.603
If there was more
contrast in the fish,

28:08.686 --> 28:11.022
I think it would
stand out a lot more.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.066
This thing would
be well-balanced

28:13.149 --> 28:14.275
with lighter water
and a dark fish.

28:14.359 --> 28:18.113
So that this thing doesn't
look like one big gray tone.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.407
That being said,
Jamie, this tattoo has some

28:20.490 --> 28:22.283
very nice points to it.

28:26.788 --> 28:26.871
Jesse.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.960
Are you comfortable
in the Japanese style?

28:32.043 --> 28:33.253
Not at all.
This is my first one.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.464
This is definitely the most
non-Jesse tattoo you've done.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.967
There's definitely a lot
of elements that you hit

28:39.050 --> 28:40.051
really nicely.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.386
The Jewel kind of look
in the top of the armor.

28:41.469 --> 28:42.804
The little details inside.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.722
The drapery, the clothes,
the fabric.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.226
It really sets it apart
and gives it that life.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.644
This is a really strict image,

28:49.727 --> 28:51.146
and you held to it really well.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.147
Your balance was there.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.566
This was very refreshing
for me to see today.

28:54.649 --> 28:58.611
The closest tattoo
to traditional Japanese

28:58.695 --> 28:59.988
that I've seen all night.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.406
Pulled it off and accomplished
the look that we're looking for.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.700
{\an5}-Well done.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.700
-Thank you.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.580
Sebastian.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.916
You were pretty
excited about having

29:12.000 --> 29:13.501
a Bellator fighter canvas.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.711
Yeah, I was
pretty hyped about it.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.130
{\an5}-He was open to his design.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.130
-Yeah.

29:17.213 --> 29:18.506
He wanted strength and power.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.341
The Japanese tiger
fits with him nicely.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.760
You lost the dynamics
of a tiger.

29:22.844 --> 29:26.264
This looks like someone
wearing a tiger suit.

29:27.682 --> 29:28.683
It has the anatomy of a human.

29:28.766 --> 29:31.686
The way his head is,
his shoulders, his hands.

29:31.769 --> 29:33.688
His waist, his butt,
and his feet.

29:33.771 --> 29:35.106
It's standing there
and makes it look like

29:35.190 --> 29:38.193
this thing is--uh, yeah,
he's humping that rock.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.861
Hey, I ain't got
nothing to do with that.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.029
You don't have anything to do--

29:41.112 --> 29:42.906
{\an5}-you didn't draw this tiger?

29:41.112 --> 29:42.906
-Yeah, I drew it.

29:42.989 --> 29:45.366
Then you have
everything to do with it.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.701
Doing so much black
in the background

29:46.784 --> 29:50.038
really doesn't help
to accentuate the tiger.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.707
From three feet back,
it's hard to tell what's what.

29:52.790 --> 29:55.877
If you can't pull off
a clean, solid background,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.545
why bother?

29:57.629 --> 29:58.379
You didn't hit it out
of the park on this one,

29:58.463 --> 30:00.381
that's for sure.

30:05.011 --> 30:05.887
Steve.

30:08.264 --> 30:09.891
I hope your client
loves this tattoo.

30:09.974 --> 30:10.767
{\an5}-He likes it.

30:09.974 --> 30:10.767
-'Cause I don't.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.687
Nothing balances out here.

30:14.771 --> 30:15.730
The big water swoosh
through the middle

30:15.813 --> 30:18.024
looks like a sheet
draped across there.

30:18.107 --> 30:20.610
In between the tail
where there's just open skin

30:20.693 --> 30:22.403
and water splashing
up the one side.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.488
It doesn't connect.

30:23.571 --> 30:25.782
You lost the effect.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.244
The scales should
have been bigger.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.829
They should expand with
the curves of the Koi.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.582
To enhance the transformation
of Koi into the dragon.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.502
The one fin.
Why not two at least?

30:37.585 --> 30:39.379
Put the other one up behind him.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.088
I tried it.
It didn't look right.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.423
Bro, this don't look right.

30:42.507 --> 30:44.842
It's probably the first
Dragon Koi I've done.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.052
Not really my thing.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.429
Well, what the [bleep]
is anybody here for

30:48.513 --> 30:51.724
if they come to compete and only
do one style of tattooing?

30:51.808 --> 30:53.309
No, don't even say that.
That's not how I feel.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.228
Well, that's how I feel
because when you don't

30:55.311 --> 30:56.729
feel like tattooing,
you just don't--you cruise.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.606
That's not--
that's not how it is.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.024
It's kind of like
in the beginning everybody was

31:00.108 --> 31:01.609
giving Jesse a [bleep],
because Jesse was only doing

31:01.693 --> 31:03.069
big-eyed, big-teeth things.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.989
But now we're kind of seeing
that he does different styles.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.616
You have to be able to adapt,
'cause if you don't,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.785
then expect to get out
of this competition.

31:14.998 --> 31:15.039
Sarah.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.627
{\an5}-You got the other fighter.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.627
-Yeah.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.838
{\an5}-He wanted a Daruma Doll.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.838
-What does that mean?

31:21.921 --> 31:23.131
Basically he's a fighter.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.299
He's always gonna
get knocked down.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.259
You gotta pick yourself
right back up.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.594
There are some
elements to this tattoo

31:27.677 --> 31:29.012
that are just really beautiful.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.972
I love the doll.
I love the detail.

31:31.055 --> 31:34.559
The shading in it.
The lantern, super cool.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.769
But this design
doesn't balance well.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.230
The Daruma Doll is less
than half of this tattoo.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.774
There's so much open space
up at the top.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.318
Maybe the background
was a little bit crazy,

31:43.401 --> 31:45.153
but I like it.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.281
I did put a lot of myself
into this tattoo.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.490
We weren't asking for yourself,

31:49.574 --> 31:50.450
we were asking for Japanese.

31:50.533 --> 31:51.784
No, I mean, like,
about putting my soul.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.162
Putting, like,
me, me, me, me, me.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.414
Listen, Sarah, you've
gotta shake off the last one.

31:56.497 --> 31:57.332
To get to this one.

31:57.415 --> 32:00.418
'Cause that last
psychosis was insane.

32:00.501 --> 32:01.461
I love what I do.

32:01.544 --> 32:04.088
And if you send me home
for doing a tattoo today

32:04.172 --> 32:05.715
that I love to do, then fine.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.592
I still love this tattoo.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.385
Getting all crazy
with all this background,

32:09.469 --> 32:10.678
you didn't need to do it.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.430
You would have had just as
strong of an outing without it.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.019
Tatu Baby.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.900
The overall composition
of the lotus are a little stiff.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.568
You made zero effort
to work with the contour

32:25.652 --> 32:27.820
or the shape of the body.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.114
It really doesn't move
with her curves.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.533
I was gonna add a little
more to it but she was, like,

32:32.617 --> 32:34.202
"No, I want it
to go from here to here."

32:34.285 --> 32:37.121
{\an5}-It's not flattering at all.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.121
-You're riding on a high.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.206
You've won twice.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.916
You've done some great
black-and-gray shading.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.167
You've done some nice color.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.878
I feel like the black-and-gray
just kind of changed.

32:43.961 --> 32:46.047
This has areas in it
where it's pretty choppy.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.716
It's not smooth like your
other black and grays.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.884
You have to treat
everything the same.

32:49.967 --> 32:51.928
If you're execution looks
really good on one thing,

32:52.011 --> 32:53.471
then make it look really good
on the other thing.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.890
You have to be able
to adapt to all styles.

32:55.973 --> 32:58.184
I don't hate the tattoo,
I just don't love it.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.727
It's a little bit boring to me.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.732
Clint.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.819
{\an5}-Oh, Jamie did me wonders.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.819
-How so?

33:07.902 --> 33:10.071
'Cause he knows I have issues
with my oriental dragons.

33:10.154 --> 33:13.324
I was [bleep] from
the moment we started.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.909
You're acting
like you're the victim.

33:14.992 --> 33:16.202
Clearly the client's the victim.

33:18.996 --> 33:21.165
It's just a bunch of dragon
anatomy thrown in a ball.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.085
And there's no separation
between the head and the body.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.755
The scales are a major failure.
You did them too tight.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.216
If you had done everything
on a bigger scale,

33:30.299 --> 33:31.801
it would have been
way more readable.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.511
The original drawing's huge.
It's, like, this big.

33:33.594 --> 33:34.929
I can't tattoo
as big as these guys.

33:35.012 --> 33:36.973
This isn't a dick challenge
that size matters.

33:37.056 --> 33:37.932
This is a tattoo.

33:38.015 --> 33:39.642
Dude, seriously,
you're killing me here.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.978
It's doing a clean job,
and that's it.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.606
I mean, this thing
is a [bleep] mess!

33:45.690 --> 33:47.108
It's like you shot it
in the head right off the bat

33:47.191 --> 33:50.486
and then spent the next
six hours just beating it.

33:50.570 --> 33:51.904
What's a bummer to me
is y'all didn't learn

33:51.988 --> 33:54.949
the lesson from
the traditional day.

33:55.032 --> 33:56.951
That was a precursor to this.

33:57.034 --> 33:58.494
Y'all don't know
what traditional is.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.371
Y'all came in here
and totally [bleep] it.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.956
And then it's Japanese day.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.333
Learn the [bleep] lessons, man.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.877
And that's not
just to you, Clint.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.420
That's to everybody in the room.

34:07.503 --> 34:10.297
Nobody, nobody in this room
learned their lesson

34:10.380 --> 34:11.299
from traditional day.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.010
[music]

34:17.554 --> 34:18.889
It seems to be pretty clear
at the beginning

34:18.973 --> 34:22.143
of each challenge,
what is expected of you.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.478
We're down to the wire.

34:23.561 --> 34:24.896
Any one of you could
be the next one to go.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.231
This is the most
level playing field

34:27.315 --> 34:28.149
that it could be.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.775
Next couple weeks, man,
this is it.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.277
Who really wants to stay here?

34:32.277 --> 34:33.487
Head back to the loft.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.656
For one of you,
it'll be your last visit.

34:35.739 --> 34:39.202
Because when you return, someone
will be packing their machines

34:39.284 --> 34:40.661
and closing shop.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.705
We'll call you back
when we've made our decision.

34:42.789 --> 34:46.042
[dramatic music]

34:50.254 --> 34:52.215
Big surprise.
They hated everybody's.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.425
Big surprise.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.012
None of us got it right again.
None of us.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.515
But if Jesse wins on that piece,

35:02.266 --> 35:03.184
that's horse-[bleep].

35:04.268 --> 35:04.894
{\an1}Literally.

35:04.977 --> 35:06.979
"You're the great Jesse again."

35:07.063 --> 35:08.689
I'm, like, "Oh, my [bleep] God."

35:08.773 --> 35:11.526
Hey, maybe he's
just as smart, yo.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.028
{\an8}He's just smart enough
to understand what we don't.

35:14.111 --> 35:17.198
Well, I find it funny that
Jesse took the easiest approach.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.700
And then they tell me that
I'm [bleep] not trying.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.118
I took offense.
[bleep] you, man.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.664
Think I'm mailing it in?
I'm not mailing nothing in.

35:25.748 --> 35:28.376
[music]

35:33.214 --> 35:33.881
Strangely enough, you and Clint

35:33.965 --> 35:36.884
might be in the bottom two.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.095
Clint's definitely going down.
They tore him a new ass.

35:39.178 --> 35:40.596
They tore Clint to shreds.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.057
That was my decision.
It wasn't an accident.

35:43.140 --> 35:44.517
I knew perfectly well.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.228
I've won three challenges,
plus a Flash Challenge.

35:47.311 --> 35:50.022
But I believe
I'm definitely going down.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.441
I do take offense that he
thinks I'm [bleep] not trying.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.402
When you don't feel like
tattooing, you just don't--

35:54.485 --> 35:55.570
{\an5}-You cruise.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.570
-That's not how it is.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.239
If you don't like my tattoo,
then you don't like it.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.824
But to tell me
that I don't care,

35:59.907 --> 36:01.325
then, you know,
[bleep] you, man.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.661
You think I'm going in
to tattoo real people

36:03.744 --> 36:04.662
and not giving
a [bleep], saying,

36:04.745 --> 36:06.038
"Well, I don't have to do good

36:06.122 --> 36:07.456
'cause I already
won three times."

36:07.540 --> 36:08.374
That's [bleep] insulting.

36:08.457 --> 36:10.334
I'm right there
with you on that one.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.044
We come here, we get critiqued

36:12.128 --> 36:13.087
and want to know
how good we are.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.590
But don't question
my integrity ever.

36:15.673 --> 36:16.591
Yeah. No, that's
crossing the line.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.092
You're questioning,
you know, my manhood.

36:18.175 --> 36:20.428
Don't [bleep] do that,
it's not smart.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.971
Don't ever [bleep]
question my integrity.

36:22.054 --> 36:23.139
And don't [bleep]
talk down to me.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.473
If we were in a bar,
you wouldn't [bleep]

36:24.557 --> 36:25.892
{\an5}-Question my integrity.

36:24.557 --> 36:25.892
-That [bleep] pissed me off.

36:25.975 --> 36:27.184
Get close enough
and tell me that.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.102
{\an5}-Exactly how I feel.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.102
-It's bull [bleep].

36:31.188 --> 36:31.939
All right, guys.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.441
Starting off with
Jessie's tattoo,

36:33.524 --> 36:35.234
which could be
the tattoo of the day.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.194
This is definitely one
of my favorite tattoos.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.946
I like that he went true
to Japanese tattooing

36:39.030 --> 36:40.072
and really did his homework.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.950
Seeing him do it
extremely clean,

36:43.034 --> 36:44.493
that says a lot about him.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.954
He's the one person
on traditional day that learned.

36:47.038 --> 36:47.788
Jamie's Koi.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.874
Overall it was
one of my favorites,

36:49.957 --> 36:51.626
because it's drawn accurately.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.711
I don't think that it
looks balanced on the leg.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.631
I think it looks off-balance
from the way it's sitting.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.840
Who would be on the bottom here?

36:57.924 --> 36:59.342
I know I've been giving Clint
a lot of [bleep],

36:59.425 --> 37:01.344
but I think
he's a great tattooer.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.721
He can outline better
than almost anybody in the room,

37:03.804 --> 37:06.641
but this tattoo,
there's no redeeming qualities.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.643
You can't tell what it is
from five feet away.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.977
The scales don't work.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.480
The anatomy of the dragon really
competes with the background.

37:12.563 --> 37:15.149
And I hate to bash that because
somebody's wearing that tattoo.

37:15.232 --> 37:18.110
Oliver, you were
pretty rough on Steve here

37:18.194 --> 37:20.154
{\an5}-with the Koi dragon.

37:18.194 --> 37:20.154
-This one hurts me.

37:20.237 --> 37:21.322
That one big claw, it's hideous.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.116
{\an5}-Why not two at least?

37:21.405 --> 37:24.116
-This is balance.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.826
So at least put
the other one up.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.328
It's the worst tattoo he's done.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.747
{\an5}-He just took a nosedive, man.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.747
-Bottom of the day?

37:29.830 --> 37:31.582
Tatu Baby.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.168
It was the ugliest
Japanese tattoo.

37:34.251 --> 37:35.670
This layout is rough.

37:35.753 --> 37:36.963
It just doesn't
follow tradition.

37:37.046 --> 37:38.214
It's a shame for the client.

37:38.297 --> 37:40.049
They came in thinking

37:40.132 --> 37:41.425
they're gonna leave
with a masterpiece.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.678
All right, guys,
I think we have a decision.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.345
{\an5}-Yeah.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.345
-Oliver, you wanna go get them?

37:47.682 --> 37:50.184
[door closes]

37:50.268 --> 37:52.353
It's getting rough, guys.
It's getting rough.

37:52.436 --> 37:56.941
I need to see Jesse,
Baby, Clint, and Steve.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.234
See you all down there.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.070
[music]

38:01.696 --> 38:05.282
[dramatic music]

38:11.414 --> 38:14.542
One of you impressed us
with your balance,

38:14.625 --> 38:17.545
and the rest of you
didn't even come close.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.921
The good news.

38:19.005 --> 38:23.509
The judges have decided
that the best tattoo of the day

38:23.592 --> 38:25.803
{\an5}-goes to Jesse.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.803
-Thank you.

38:25.886 --> 38:27.179
I was impressed
how you did your research

38:27.263 --> 38:28.597
and your homework,
and it showed.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.266
Your design was very readable,
it was clean.

38:30.349 --> 38:34.020
Truest to the traditional
Japanese tattoo.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.563
{\an5}-Well done.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.563
-Thank you.

38:35.646 --> 38:41.736
Clint, Tatu Baby and Steve.
None of you impressed us today.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.237
Tatu Baby.

38:43.320 --> 38:46.240
I tried my best to persuade
my client into getting all these

38:46.323 --> 38:48.034
Japanese-themed tattoos,

38:48.117 --> 38:49.493
and she just wanted
the simplest one.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.579
It was just
a simple, simple tattoo

38:51.662 --> 38:52.705
with simple,
straight-forward elements.

38:52.788 --> 38:55.416
I tried my best trying
to add more to the piece.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.543
Make the most out of something
that's very simple.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.795
Really sit down
and draw for this style

38:59.879 --> 39:01.213
to try to keep yourself
in a great position.

39:01.297 --> 39:04.258
Just a boring
snoozer out of you.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.886
Steve.

39:06.969 --> 39:07.845
You have tremendous potential
and you kind of slept

39:07.928 --> 39:10.264
on this one tonight.

39:10.347 --> 39:12.683
The case being thrown
out there that I'm coasting,

39:12.767 --> 39:13.768
or I'm not trying--

39:13.851 --> 39:15.436
you didn't show us
that you really wanted it.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.021
I mean, I want this.
That's why I'm here.

39:17.104 --> 39:18.314
I made a mistake,
I'm really trying to step

39:18.397 --> 39:20.941
out of the box,
get my client what he asked for,

39:21.025 --> 39:23.611
instead of just staying truer
to the traditional style.

39:23.694 --> 39:27.031
Do you feel that your piece
is the worst tonight?

39:27.114 --> 39:29.116
I'm not saying
I did a great tattoo today,

39:29.200 --> 39:31.285
but I've won three challenges.

39:31.368 --> 39:33.829
I feel I've shown that I'm
a really good tattoo artist.

39:34.830 --> 39:35.998
Clint.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.917
I came in today
and I just dropped the ball.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.335
I [bleep] up a lot.

39:39.418 --> 39:42.463
All you had to do today
was just do a decent dragon

39:42.546 --> 39:44.632
that we could tell what
the [bleep] was going on.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.801
{\an5}-You botched a lot of elements.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.801
-I'm really good at what I do.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.302
But this is just
a tiny little section.

39:48.385 --> 39:50.971
The tattoo you did today
is not a good representation

39:51.055 --> 39:52.848
of what you're capable of.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.308
This is a big kick in the ass.

39:54.391 --> 39:55.684
I'm trying to stay
real humble right now.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.478
I take everybody's
advice to heart.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.354
I'm willing to learn.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.522
You made it this far in the game

39:59.605 --> 40:02.775
and I really would expect more
from here on out.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.485
This is crunch time.
The heat is on.

40:04.568 --> 40:05.486
It's gotten to that point.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.240
The judges have decided...

40:09.323 --> 40:10.491
[music]

40:13.786 --> 40:16.163
Clint.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.291
You do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.626
We're a little bummed
that we're sending home

40:20.709 --> 40:21.836
a really technical tattooer.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.922
But somebody's gotta go home,
it's just come down to it.

40:25.005 --> 40:27.007
You've shown us a lot
of things in this competition.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.092
You've [bleep] up
and you've came back

40:28.175 --> 40:30.177
and redeemed yourself.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.428
But your tattoo
was the worst one today

40:31.512 --> 40:34.181
and there's no more room
for comebacks.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.642
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:37.893 --> 40:38.686
Get the [bleep] out of here.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.355
I busted my ass
on that [bleep] tattoo.

40:41.438 --> 40:43.440
I do bad-ass [bleep] tattoos.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.860
I don't need a [bleep] title
to make myself feel better.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.112
I'm too [bleep] good
to be eliminated right now.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.029
They're gonna regret
that [bleep] decision.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.699
I mean, seriously.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.826
That--that's just [bleep] up.

{\an8}one of my guitars.

41:05.379 --> 41:06.881
