J " Gloriana J".

00:14.140 --> 00:20.354
J " Gloriana J".

00:27.278 --> 00:33.409
J " Gloriana, hallelujah J".

00:44.295 --> 00:45.421
<i>Vive la republic!</i>

00:45.588 --> 00:47.673
<i>Vive la republic!</i>

00:50.551 --> 00:52.094
Is Mama going to die?

00:52.261 --> 00:55.139
If she does, you'll be king
and you'll have a crown

00:55.306 --> 00:56.867
and everybody will
curtsy to you, Bertie.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.643
Why do I have to be king?

00:58.809 --> 00:59.977
You just do!

01:00.144 --> 01:01.354
But you're older than me.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.939
Yes, but you're a boy.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.899
But Mama isn't a boy.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.275
Don't you know anything?

01:06.442 --> 01:09.904
It's called
primogeniture, Bertie.

01:10.071 --> 01:13.824
They only make a girl queen
if they can't find anybody else.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.219
What
are you two doing out of bed?

01:15.243 --> 01:16.243
Come along!

01:20.289 --> 01:21.289
Get back!

01:24.502 --> 01:26.712
Screaming won't make it
come any faster.

01:30.925 --> 01:31.925
Are we safe?

01:36.389 --> 01:37.223
Go!

01:37.390 --> 01:40.226
I will take care of Victoria.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.815
FEODORA: Go!

01:45.982 --> 01:48.192
<i>S'?</i>

01:48.359 --> 01:52.405
Please God, don't let Mama die.

01:52.571 --> 01:55.533
I want guards right around
the perimeter of the palace.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.784
Everywhere.

01:56.951 --> 01:57.994
Is that understood?

01:58.160 --> 01:59.161
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.454
Good.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.666
<i>One of them was in</i> a
<i>comment va dire...</i>

02:03.833 --> 02:05.334
A swing...

02:05.501 --> 02:06.794
; A swing!

02:08.963 --> 02:10.840
By all, that's splendid!

02:11.007 --> 02:12.258
Don't you think, Alfred?

02:12.425 --> 02:13.425
Mon cher, please,

02:13.551 --> 02:14.885
come and join us.

02:16.512 --> 02:19.307
Sir, I-| thought the king
would be safer here.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.018
Gambling? At a time like this?

02:22.184 --> 02:24.437
Life is a game of chance,

02:24.603 --> 02:25.998
maybe I will lose
this hand as well.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.302
Sir, the queen
is asking for you.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.956
I believe the moment has come.
Thank you.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.280
What are you doing here?

02:34.447 --> 02:36.407
As a member
of the Privy Council,

02:36.574 --> 02:39.452
I am required to attend
a royal birth,

02:39.618 --> 02:41.787
to make sure
it's the genuine article.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.874
Then why are you
playing cards with Louis Philippe?

02:45.041 --> 02:47.043
You know the prince loathes
this kind of thing.

02:47.209 --> 02:51.630
Oh, what a courtier
you've become, my dear.

02:51.797 --> 02:52.882
Monmouth...

02:57.219 --> 02:58.387
Albert!

03:01.599 --> 03:02.683
The mob has dispersed.

03:12.651 --> 03:16.989
The rioting cannot continue!

03:17.156 --> 03:19.742
Our movement will only succeed
if we have the support

03:19.909 --> 03:21.327
of respectable people.

03:21.494 --> 03:23.037
We must stay within the law.

03:23.204 --> 03:26.707
Do you really think that a few
signatures and pretty banners

03:26.874 --> 03:29.293
are going to make
the prime minister say,

03:29.460 --> 03:31.337
"Come in, why don't you?
Universal franchise,

03:31.504 --> 03:33.422
what a splendid idea"?

03:33.589 --> 03:36.550
A revolution without teeth
cannot bite.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.140
What's happened to you?

03:43.307 --> 03:44.493
Oh, don't look at me like that,
Abigail.

03:44.517 --> 03:46.977
I want to be a free man,

03:47.144 --> 03:48.646
one worthy of a woman like you.

03:52.066 --> 03:56.195
<i>S'?</i>

04:03.119 --> 04:04.203
Oh, hello.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.838
I apologize, Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness,

04:14.004 --> 04:16.132
but I couldn't keep them away
a moment longer.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.552
This one's quite pretty
for an infant.

04:19.718 --> 04:20.998
Better than the last one,
anyway.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.847
I am glad you're not dead, Mama.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.479
Dear Mama and Papa,

04:30.646 --> 04:32.231
we have come to welcome

04:32.398 --> 04:34.608
our new baby sister.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.735
Oh!

04:36.902 --> 04:37.902
Oh!

04:39.530 --> 04:42.575
How is my... little niece?

04:42.741 --> 04:44.452
Oh...

04:45.494 --> 04:47.246
Such a flower.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.541
I wonder...

04:50.708 --> 04:53.002
<i>what they will</i> call <i>you,</i>
my <i>kleine m√©dchen.</i>

04:53.169 --> 04:55.796
We're going to name her
after someone...

04:55.963 --> 04:58.257
Who has a very

04:58.424 --> 05:01.969
special place in this family.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.262
Albert's mother.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.809
Meet Princess Louise.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.771
Hm. Ja.

05:17.943 --> 05:18.943
What was that?

05:19.028 --> 05:20.738
The baby must have come.

05:20.905 --> 05:24.700
Yet another royal mouth to feed
when children are starving!

05:28.787 --> 05:32.666
<i>S'?</i>

05:44.386 --> 05:45.596
Wellington.

05:45.763 --> 05:46.597
Lady Portman.

05:46.764 --> 05:47.890
Duke.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.018
Duke!

05:51.185 --> 05:53.229
Is this really necessary?

05:53.395 --> 05:55.439
The queen is still weak
after her ordeal.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.152
I can assure you, sir,
I wouldn't be here

06:00.319 --> 06:02.821
unless the necessity
was not of the gravest.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.953
The prime minister
and Palmerston

06:09.119 --> 06:10.454
are also on their way.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.331
Right.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.627
May I congratulate you, ma'am,

06:16.794 --> 06:18.003
on behalf of your government,

06:18.170 --> 06:20.923
and apologize for intruding
at this time.

06:21.090 --> 06:25.302
But our intelligence suggests
that hundreds of thousands

06:25.469 --> 06:27.263
of Chartists
will attempt to deliver

06:27.429 --> 06:29.515
their so-called
"People's Charter"

06:29.682 --> 06:31.475
any day now.

06:31.642 --> 06:35.729
If this gathering were to...
get out of hand.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.732
They must be contained
south of the river.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.777
There have been riots already...
Great crowds like this

06:41.944 --> 06:45.239
I can't answer
for what could happen.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.950
But I understood the Chartists
to be a peaceful movement.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.761
Call throwing bricks
through your window peaceful?

06:49.785 --> 06:51.954
I believe that protest
was directed against

06:52.121 --> 06:53.330
the French king.

06:53.497 --> 06:54.724
The duke wants to station troops

06:54.748 --> 06:56.125
on the bridges.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.585
Cavalry and artillery, ma'am.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.920
Let them know we mean it.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.132
It should never
have come to this.

07:03.299 --> 07:06.176
We have failed these people.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.305
Do we have permission
to mobilize the troops, ma'am?

07:09.471 --> 07:11.682
<i>'U.</i>

07:11.849 --> 07:14.685
I don't think it's... necessary.

07:14.852 --> 07:15.936
Liebes...

07:16.103 --> 07:17.229
It is the only way

07:17.396 --> 07:19.440
of defending Parliament
and the palace, ma'am.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.108
Perhaps you don't
quite understand

07:21.275 --> 07:22.818
what these Chartists
have in mind.

07:22.985 --> 07:27.406
Actually, Lord Palmerston,
I have spoken with a Chartist.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.074
Can you say the same?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.618
With respect, ma'am,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.220
one conversation doesn't
make one an expert.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.579
Please,
remember you are speaking

07:33.746 --> 07:35.080
to the queen.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.373
Beg your pardon.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.585
I allowed my anxiety
to eclipse my good manners.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.715
You must give the order

07:44.882 --> 07:46.342
to mobilize the troops, ma'am.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.594
To use soldiers to disrupt
a peaceful movement

07:48.761 --> 07:50.471
seems to me the height of folly!

07:56.352 --> 07:58.854
I cannot,
and I will not condone it,

07:59.021 --> 08:00.221
and I will not sign the order!

08:02.274 --> 08:05.736
<i>S'?</i>

08:08.489 --> 08:10.491
Move!

08:12.034 --> 08:13.744
Right, everyone get back!

08:13.911 --> 08:15.245
Stand back there!

08:15.412 --> 08:17.414
What is this?

08:17.581 --> 08:19.101
What right do you have to come
in here?

08:25.005 --> 08:28.092
<i>S'?</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:38.686
Did you know anything
about the guns?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.396
Why? Because I'm Irish?

08:40.562 --> 08:42.314
No! OFFICER: Patrick Fitzgerald?

08:42.481 --> 08:43.667
I'm arresting you
on a charge of treason.

08:43.691 --> 08:44.691
Let him go! Come on.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.027
Let him go!

08:47.194 --> 08:48.922
Believe me when I say
I never expected to meet

08:48.946 --> 08:50.030
a woman like you.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.368
<i>S'?</i>

09:00.290 --> 09:03.502
<i>S'?</i>

09:10.968 --> 09:17.683
<i>S'?</i>

09:25.733 --> 09:30.863
<i>S'?</i>

09:35.367 --> 09:39.121
<i>S'?</i>

09:48.380 --> 09:50.466
We own a hotel.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.260
You've done it?

09:53.427 --> 09:56.180
Without telling me.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.724
The owner's scared stiff
of the Chartists,

09:58.891 --> 10:00.642
so he agreed to lower the price.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.105
I wish you'd asked me first.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.236
And what would you
have said if I had?

10:11.403 --> 10:12.654
"The queen needs me.

10:12.821 --> 10:15.032
I can't abandon her
in her hour of need."

10:24.583 --> 10:27.795
Special license.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.048
You know I can't be married,
I'll have to resign.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.509
You will, yes.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.115
I want to start
our real life, Nancy.

10:37.387 --> 10:41.308
Tomorrow, 3:00, St. Bride's.

10:41.475 --> 10:45.479
<i>S'?</i>

10:45.646 --> 10:47.898
I'll be there.

10:48.065 --> 10:52.277
<i>S'?</i>

10:57.324 --> 11:00.869
<i>S'?</i>

11:05.958 --> 11:09.503
<i>S'?</i>

11:26.061 --> 11:30.399
Ah-ah, the queen has only agreed
to see her prime minister.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.860
Banished!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.152
From the Garden of Eden!

11:35.779 --> 11:37.447
Or maybe not.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.035
Rifles?

11:42.202 --> 11:45.205
Enough to arm a regiment.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.749
This is not a peaceful protest.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.962
I'm afraid

11:52.129 --> 11:53.255
there is no choice, ma'am.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.133
<i>S'?</i>

11:56.300 --> 11:59.011
If the Chartists
are going to protest,

11:59.177 --> 12:02.514
we must put troops
on the streets.

12:04.933 --> 12:05.933
<i>S'?</i>

12:16.486 --> 12:18.655
<i>S'?</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:37.758
<i>Klugscheisser.</i>

12:41.511 --> 12:43.013
You speak German?

12:43.180 --> 12:44.514
French and Italian.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.561
I like to understand
who I'm dealing with.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.855
I sometimes I
have to remind myself

12:52.022 --> 12:54.191
that you're foreign secretary.

12:54.358 --> 12:58.278
And what is diplomacy
but a balancing act...

12:59.363 --> 13:01.281
Prime Minister?

13:01.448 --> 13:07.037
<i>S'?</i>

13:17.965 --> 13:20.884
Papa calls me
his philosopher princess.

13:21.051 --> 13:25.555
Of course, you English
were the first people

13:25.722 --> 13:28.058
to get rid of your king.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.352
What happened to him?

13:30.519 --> 13:33.730
<i>S'?</i>

13:33.897 --> 13:36.024
They cut off his head

13:36.191 --> 13:38.360
but with an axe.

13:40.904 --> 13:44.908
It took a Frenchman to invent
Ia guillotine.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.578
What's la guillotine?

13:48.745 --> 13:52.457
<i>S'?</i>

13:52.624 --> 13:53.709
Are they going to cut off

13:53.875 --> 13:55.085
your head, Mama?

13:55.252 --> 13:56.586
King Louis says

13:56.753 --> 13:59.034
that's what they do in France
when they have a revolution.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.258
Madame La Guillotine
cuts off their heads

14:01.425 --> 14:03.010
and then they hold them up
by the hair.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.709
It seems His Majesty was rather

14:05.846 --> 14:07.264
colorful in his language.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.016
Vicky, Bertie, come here.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.768
Come here.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.998
Do you think I would let
anyone hurt Mama?

14:15.022 --> 14:16.148
No.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.276
Or any of us for that matter?

14:19.443 --> 14:21.111
No.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.988
But do you have a sword, Papa?

14:23.155 --> 14:24.281
Bertie!

14:30.162 --> 14:31.913
Victoria, it's too soon.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.207
You must rest.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.459
Come here.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.128
Come here.

14:38.295 --> 14:43.508
<i>S'?</i>

14:57.189 --> 14:58.774
You frightened my children!

15:01.693 --> 15:03.493
I gave them a little lesson
in French history.

15:03.612 --> 15:04.905
I'm sure they will recover.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.032
No, no, no, we invited you here
against the advice

15:07.074 --> 15:09.242
of our ministers,
my-my own misgivings,

15:09.409 --> 15:10.827
and this is how you repay us.

15:10.994 --> 15:14.289
Your children need to know
that life is uncertain,

15:14.456 --> 15:15.874
even here in England.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.336
Nothing will happen
to my children.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.380
I hope you are right.

15:22.547 --> 15:26.259
Your presence here...

15:26.426 --> 15:28.512
is a provocation.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.101
Then I must not
outstay my welcome.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.271
I have nowhere else to go,

15:38.438 --> 15:42.025
but of course that is
of no matter.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.876
Such a look of the prince
she has, ma'am.

16:02.712 --> 16:06.675
The... the seamstress,
the Chartist...

16:06.842 --> 16:07.926
Abigail?

16:08.093 --> 16:09.219
Abigail.

16:11.221 --> 16:15.308
Abigail told me the Chartists
loved their queen.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.771
She was wrong.

16:21.857 --> 16:27.696
And now I need soldiers
to defend me from my own people.

16:27.863 --> 16:30.824
<i>S'?</i>

16:30.991 --> 16:32.826
When I was a little girl,

16:32.993 --> 16:37.539
I made a promise to myself,
Skerrett, that I would be

16:37.706 --> 16:38.790
not just a queen,

16:38.957 --> 16:42.294
but a great queen,

16:42.460 --> 16:47.757
whose reign would be remembered
as a glorious one.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.301
<i>S'?</i>

16:50.719 --> 16:54.139
Now there are no cheers for me,

16:54.306 --> 16:56.016
only for Lord Palmerston.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.560
Why don't they understand he
only cares about his own glory?

16:58.727 --> 17:00.437
A London crowd would cheer
anyone

17:00.604 --> 17:02.439
who gave them free beer.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.525
Forgive me, ma'am,

17:05.692 --> 17:08.278
a queen doesn't need
to curry favor.

17:08.445 --> 17:10.322
But I want them to love me.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.327
I want them to love me.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.748
Otherwise, what is the point?

17:33.053 --> 17:36.348
<i>S'?</i>

17:36.514 --> 17:39.476
Thank you.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.812
What will they do to Patrick,
Mr. O'Connor?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.064
Well,

17:44.231 --> 17:47.067
if he's found guilty
of treason...

17:47.234 --> 17:51.321
they'll... hang him.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.257
But he told me he had nothing
to do with the guns,

17:53.281 --> 17:54.449
and I believe him.

17:54.616 --> 17:55.742
Even if he put them there,

17:55.909 --> 17:58.995
where would he find the money
to buy 500 rifles?

17:59.162 --> 18:00.872
So you believe
Patrick's innocent?

18:01.039 --> 18:02.039
I don't know.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.584
But I do know the government
is frightened

18:04.751 --> 18:06.461
by the power of the people.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.145
<i>S'?</i>

18:25.438 --> 18:27.732
Whoa there! Whoa there!

18:32.237 --> 18:33.947
Whoa!

18:34.114 --> 18:36.825
Get that stag out the way, man!

18:36.992 --> 18:39.119
<i>S'?</i>

18:47.544 --> 18:49.379
Trouble ahead, sir.

18:54.968 --> 18:59.973
<i>S'?</i>

19:00.140 --> 19:01.683
Gentlemen! Get out!

19:01.850 --> 19:03.101
Palmerston!

19:03.268 --> 19:04.978
Palmerston!

19:07.314 --> 19:08.565
May I be of assistance?

19:08.732 --> 19:11.860
<i>S'?</i>

19:12.027 --> 19:13.153
Drink.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.909
Thank you.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.446
Are you sure you aren't hurt?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.248
I think my bonnet
is my only casualty,

19:25.415 --> 19:28.585
and my pride, of course,
Lord Palmerston.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.187
Well, I like nothing more
than ministering

19:30.211 --> 19:31.671
to a duchess in distress.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.715
Have there been so many? None...

19:33.882 --> 19:35.800
more charming than yourself.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.846
Quite a little collection.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.097
Oh.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.264
They're for my son.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.517
He... he misses me.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.521
Well, who could blame him?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.523
But it is too dangerous
to go anywhere today

19:50.690 --> 19:52.400
and I would like to know
that you're safe.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.570
Get on then!

20:05.622 --> 20:08.208
Are you sure this
will be necessary, Duke?

20:08.374 --> 20:09.643
There troops are on the bridges,

20:09.667 --> 20:10.919
but if the Chartists

20:11.086 --> 20:14.297
do get across the river,
we must be prepared.

20:14.464 --> 20:18.301
They must know that we will
not tolerate insurrection.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.221
Yes, but the Chartists
must be allowed to know

20:21.387 --> 20:24.349
that their cause
is not a hopeless one.

20:24.516 --> 20:27.811
They then need a turnip...

20:27.977 --> 20:29.062
That is not correct,

20:29.229 --> 20:30.313
they-they need a carrot

20:30.480 --> 20:33.191
as well as a stick.

20:33.358 --> 20:37.987
Perhaps, but my priority now
is to keep the queen safe.

20:38.154 --> 20:42.283
Well, there we are
in agreement, Duke.

20:42.450 --> 20:46.663
As soon as the queen can travel,
we shall be leaving for Osborne.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.582
And...

20:49.749 --> 20:53.837
I hope that that
French gentleman...

20:54.003 --> 20:55.547
will be leaving London too.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.966
There we are also in agreement.

20:58.133 --> 21:02.846
He shall not be spending
one more night at the palace.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.306
<i>S'?</i>

21:13.231 --> 21:15.191
He was most kind,

21:15.358 --> 21:16.838
and of course
when the people saw him,

21:16.943 --> 21:20.530
they were ready to help
set things straight.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.490
I see.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.578
Please tell him
I wish to see him.

21:26.744 --> 21:27.954
Yes, ma'am.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.502
But I thought...

21:34.669 --> 21:36.546
No, no, I don't like him.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.924
But that doesn't...

21:42.510 --> 21:44.220
Feo, I don't expect you
to understand.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.974
You've never been
in my position.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.767
No, it is true.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.978
But I know what it's like
to be threatened by a mob

21:52.145 --> 21:54.606
and live in a small country
surrounded by enemies.

21:54.772 --> 21:56.691
Langenburg is
hardly the same as England.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.237
How would you know?

22:01.404 --> 22:02.697
Whose fault is that?

22:04.616 --> 22:06.910
You're the one who left!

22:07.076 --> 22:08.620
You didn't even
come to my wedding.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.622
Did it ever occur to you
I couldn't afford it?

22:10.788 --> 22:11.956
Well, if you'd asked...

22:12.123 --> 22:14.542
What, beg money from
my little sister?

22:16.878 --> 22:18.588
No, I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

22:18.755 --> 22:20.048
After all,

22:20.215 --> 22:22.091
you have never been
in my position.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.357
Would you like a marron glace',
Aunt Feo?

22:51.788 --> 22:53.748
You must pardon my appearance,
Your Majesty,

22:53.915 --> 22:56.459
Lord Alfred said you wanted
to see me at once.

22:56.626 --> 23:00.546
I believe, Lord Palmerston,
you have... quite a following.

23:04.634 --> 23:07.637
I think the people know
what I stand for, ma'am.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.976
The guns that were found,

23:13.142 --> 23:15.561
do you really think they meant
to use them against me?

23:18.022 --> 23:20.066
I think it's a possibility.

23:20.233 --> 23:21.833
That's why we're taking
every precaution.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.822
Am I really so unpopular?

23:25.989 --> 23:28.783
My brother-in-law,
Lord Melbourne,

23:28.950 --> 23:31.160
used to say that

23:31.327 --> 23:33.162
the great British public
isn't known

23:33.329 --> 23:35.248
for its logic, ma'am.

23:35.415 --> 23:38.001
Lord M?

23:38.167 --> 23:40.336
He also said it was the greatest
privilege of his life

23:40.503 --> 23:42.213
to serve as your prime minister.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.340
Would he have advised me
to sign that order?

23:46.676 --> 23:51.848
Setting... troops
against my own people?

23:52.015 --> 23:53.933
I think he would have said
that your safety

23:54.100 --> 23:57.020
is more important
than your popularity, ma'am.

23:57.186 --> 24:02.066
<i>S'?</i>

24:08.948 --> 24:13.828
<i>S'?</i>

24:23.504 --> 24:27.675
<i>S'?</i>

24:42.648 --> 24:46.944
<i>S'?</i>

24:48.821 --> 24:50.156
Ah, Feo.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.828
I think it is time
I went back to Langenburg.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.205
Leave?

24:57.371 --> 24:59.457
Now? Why?

24:59.624 --> 25:00.792
I hoped so much

25:00.958 --> 25:03.711
to be of some use, but...

25:03.878 --> 25:05.338
I cannot stay
where I am not wanted.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.090
Oh, Well,

25:07.256 --> 25:11.135
I am not sure Victoria knows
exactly what she wants.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.054
She is often...

25:13.221 --> 25:15.807
volatile after giving birth.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.853
You stay.

25:23.397 --> 25:24.565
Oh!

25:25.399 --> 25:26.943
Where is she?

25:27.110 --> 25:29.112
She's in the garden.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.114
With Lord Palmerston.
Palmerston?

25:32.532 --> 25:33.658
Strange...

25:35.368 --> 25:41.082
<i>S'?</i>

25:44.335 --> 25:47.004
Victoria?

25:47.171 --> 25:48.923
Liebes.

25:53.261 --> 25:54.428
My lOve?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.015
Oh...

26:02.270 --> 26:03.396
You all right?

26:05.982 --> 26:09.694
Did Lord Pilgerstein upset you?

26:11.529 --> 26:13.739
I keep thinking about the day
of my accession.

26:19.579 --> 26:22.081
All those old men
looking down at me, frowning,

26:22.248 --> 26:26.127
as if...

26:26.294 --> 26:29.755
as if it was all
a dreadful mistake.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.592
And then I went out onto
the balcony and...

26:35.970 --> 26:37.305
I heard it.

26:37.471 --> 26:39.348
I heard the sound
of my people...

26:42.184 --> 26:43.311
cheefing.

26:47.148 --> 26:51.402
I knew then what it meant
to be a queen.

26:54.405 --> 26:59.660
It's been there, the bass note
that anchors all the...

26:59.827 --> 27:01.287
noise around me.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.001
It's gone.

27:08.544 --> 27:09.670
Albert, it's...

27:11.464 --> 27:12.548
It's gone.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.134
No, no, no.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.761
You are tired.

27:16.928 --> 27:20.598
Victoria, you are not
seeing things correctly.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.850
Albert, those guns
were meant to kill me!

27:23.017 --> 27:24.852
Which is why
we are going to Osborne

27:25.019 --> 27:26.520
as soon as you are fit
to travel.

27:26.687 --> 27:28.731
No, no, no, Albert, no,
they will call me a coward.

27:28.898 --> 27:30.024
All that matters, Victoria,

27:30.191 --> 27:32.193
is that you and the children
are safe.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.612
I know I am being selfish,

27:34.779 --> 27:40.952
but to me, you are the note

27:41.118 --> 27:43.329
that anchors me to this world.

27:44.914 --> 27:49.085
And I will do anything
to keep you safe from harm.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.922
<i>S'?</i>

28:12.441 --> 28:13.985
You are far away, ma ch√©re.

28:15.403 --> 28:16.988
I am sorry to disturb you,

28:17.154 --> 28:18.864
<i>bu‚Äú have come to say goodbye.</i>

28:19.031 --> 28:21.200
Do you regret leaving France?

28:21.367 --> 28:23.494
<i>Bien sur.</i>

28:23.661 --> 28:26.789
France is the only civilized
country in the world.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.544
But I would rather
live among savages

28:31.711 --> 28:35.047
than meet Madame La Guillotine.

28:38.259 --> 28:42.179
We're going to...
Osborne in the morning.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.308
And you think
that makes you like me?

28:49.186 --> 28:50.312
A coward?

28:53.065 --> 28:55.026
<i>S'?</i>

28:55.192 --> 28:57.319
Listen to me,

28:57.486 --> 29:00.573
life is more important
than a crown.

29:01.907 --> 29:06.871
<i>S'?</i>

29:07.038 --> 29:08.414
Where will you go?

29:10.249 --> 29:12.460
Durrant's Hotel.

29:14.754 --> 29:18.215
It is well appointed, lbefieve.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.426
No... no, no, no,
that will never do.

29:20.593 --> 29:23.596
I'll tell Uncle Leopold
to lend you Claremont.

29:24.847 --> 29:25.931
It's out of London

29:26.098 --> 29:27.641
and suitable for a king.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.065
Remember,

29:34.231 --> 29:36.150
you have your family, ma ch√©re.

29:36.317 --> 29:40.404
<i>S'?</i>

29:44.158 --> 29:47.787
<i>S'?</i>

30:07.389 --> 30:09.391
<i>S'?</i>

30:25.032 --> 30:27.618
Albert says you're
thinking of leaving.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.373
<i>Ja.</i>

30:32.540 --> 30:35.251
I think that would be better.

30:35.417 --> 30:37.670
You are...

30:37.837 --> 30:39.296
You have no room for me.

30:42.550 --> 30:46.846
I was... unkind before.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.014
All I want is to help you.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.433
And you know

30:51.600 --> 30:55.729
you can always trust me
absolutely.

30:55.896 --> 30:59.984
I think perhaps I'm
not used to having a sister.

31:04.446 --> 31:05.823
But I don't want you to leave,
Feo.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.325
Oh Drina!

31:08.492 --> 31:10.286
Ah...

31:10.452 --> 31:12.955
You have no idea
how happy that makes me.

31:13.122 --> 31:17.543
Then it's settled,

31:17.710 --> 31:20.337
you will come to Osborne
in the morning.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.464
(Uaughs)

31:22.631 --> 31:24.300
I must go,

31:24.466 --> 31:26.826
I have to make arrangements for
my son while I'm in Osborne.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.721
But the streets are not safe.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.640
You must have an escort.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.183
Joseph, please see the Duchess

31:33.350 --> 31:34.935
gets home safely. Lady Portman.

31:35.102 --> 31:38.939
Yes, of course they speak
English on the Isle of Wight.

31:39.106 --> 31:41.400
<i>S'?</i>

31:46.238 --> 31:48.115
Brodie!

31:48.282 --> 31:49.602
I need you
to do something for me.

31:49.742 --> 31:50.576
Now.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.036
But Mr. Penge will kill me.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.913
Please, it's important.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.215
I'm going to take
my atlas of the heavens.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.551
Then we can look at
the stars together, Papa,

32:07.718 --> 32:08.928
can't we? Hm.

32:11.221 --> 32:13.098
That's mine! ALBERT: Ah, Bertie!

32:13.265 --> 32:14.265
Bertie!

32:15.559 --> 32:16.685
Apologize to your sister.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.980
Sorry.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.441
How he reminds
me of you at that age, Drina.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.068
While we are in Osborne

32:24.234 --> 32:25.837
I think perhaps we shall
have to teach you how to behave

32:25.861 --> 32:26.987
like a future king.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.414
Bertie doesn't want to be king.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.416
He thinks that I
would do it better,

32:39.583 --> 32:41.669
and I would, wouldn't I?

32:41.835 --> 32:46.632
<i>S'?</i>

32:57.810 --> 33:00.270
Excuse me!

33:00.437 --> 33:02.564
Are you holding
Mr. Patrick Fitzgerald?

33:02.731 --> 33:04.011
There's no one here
by that name.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.666
Now could you move away
from the station.

33:07.695 --> 33:09.697
Patrick!

33:09.863 --> 33:12.157
But what are you doing here?

33:12.324 --> 33:13.659
I've-I've been
looking everywhere.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.245
L-I thought...

33:18.163 --> 33:20.332
My name is Inspector Daubeny.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.977
And I assure you
I've never seen you before

33:22.001 --> 33:23.252
in my life.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.254
What are you talking about?

33:26.922 --> 33:29.258
But your finger...

33:29.425 --> 33:31.260
It's missing.

33:31.427 --> 33:33.137
How perceptive of you.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.722
Now if you'll excuse me.

33:37.224 --> 33:41.353
<i>S'?</i>

33:50.237 --> 33:52.614
<i>I</i> want to <i>be a free</i> man.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.659
<i>One worthy of a woman like you.</i>

33:55.826 --> 33:59.455
<i>S'?</i>

34:09.715 --> 34:11.216
Please don't go away, Mama.

34:11.383 --> 34:12.634
I hate it when you aren't here.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.887
And I hate leaving you too.

34:15.054 --> 34:18.724
But I promise I will write
to you every day.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.435
But I'm not very good
at reading.

34:21.602 --> 34:23.479
Your Grace.

34:25.773 --> 34:26.973
You left these in the carriage

34:27.024 --> 34:29.276
and I thought
they might be of use.

34:29.443 --> 34:31.111
Yes. Look, William.

34:31.278 --> 34:32.946
I have a present for you.

34:34.448 --> 34:35.532
Now I have enough

34:35.699 --> 34:37.451
for a real battle!

34:39.286 --> 34:41.413
Ah, Duchess.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.458
No wonder our son is
falling behind in his lessons

34:44.625 --> 34:46.168
when you insist on indulging him

34:46.335 --> 34:48.045
in these childish pastimes.

34:48.212 --> 34:50.881
We were just saying goodbye.

34:51.048 --> 34:52.174
Please don't go away, Mama.

34:52.341 --> 34:53.842
Stop sniveling.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.053
Go to your room.

34:57.971 --> 35:00.891
I think it's an excellent thing
you're going to Osborne.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.643
It may be the custom among

35:02.810 --> 35:05.395
the grocer classes
to mollycoddle their sons,

35:05.562 --> 35:07.356
but William will be
a duke one day.

35:09.650 --> 35:10.930
You, get the duchess's carriage.

35:20.452 --> 35:27.584
<i>S'?</i>

35:37.386 --> 35:41.014
<i>S'?</i>

35:52.901 --> 35:55.654
<i>S'?</i>

36:03.036 --> 36:05.455
I don't want to be king, Mama.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.751
I know, darling.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.044
Come here.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.675
<i>S'?</i>

36:18.802 --> 36:20.387
Do you know what destiny means?

36:23.807 --> 36:28.979
It means that there is
something in your life

36:29.146 --> 36:30.272
you must do.

36:32.065 --> 36:36.862
And my destiny and yours

36:37.029 --> 36:38.614
is to rule this country.

36:43.827 --> 36:46.121
Think of it as
a little flame inside you.

36:48.498 --> 36:50.000
Nothing can put it out, Bertie.

36:52.878 --> 36:55.214
Vicky is better at numbers.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.717
It doesn't matter.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.719
Aunt Feo was better
at everything than me.

37:05.224 --> 37:07.476
But it is your destiny
to be king.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.397
I think you'll be a great one.

37:26.286 --> 37:30.457
<i>S'?</i>

37:40.467 --> 37:42.052
I'm here.

37:42.219 --> 37:45.430
And I've brought someone
to give me away.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.350
Let me not to the
marriage of true minds...

37:48.517 --> 37:50.018
Thank you, Brodie.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.813
<i>S'?</i>

37:54.898 --> 37:58.944
I, Nancy, take thee, Charles...

37:59.111 --> 38:01.989
I, Nancy, take thee, Charles

38:02.155 --> 38:05.367
to be my wedded husband.

38:05.534 --> 38:08.453
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.955
With this ring I thee wed.

38:10.122 --> 38:13.250
With my body I thee worship...

38:14.876 --> 38:16.795
For richer for poorer,

38:16.962 --> 38:19.965
in sickness and in health

38:20.132 --> 38:23.510
to love, cherish,

38:23.677 --> 38:25.095
and to obey

38:25.262 --> 38:26.638
till death us do part.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.056
<i>In the presence of God,</i>

38:28.223 --> 38:32.102
<i>Charles and Nancy
have given their consent,</i>

38:32.269 --> 38:34.813
<i>and made their marriage vows
to each other.</i>

38:34.980 --> 38:38.817
<i>I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.</i>

38:38.984 --> 38:40.694
<i>S'?</i>

38:44.573 --> 38:45.782
I have to speak to the queen.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.409
At once.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.911
I can't just take you in
to see the queen.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.278
Why would she want to see you?

38:51.371 --> 38:53.457
Where I come from,
we speak as we find,

38:53.623 --> 38:54.851
so you can believe me when I say

38:54.875 --> 38:57.919
this is matter
of life and death.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.213
An agent?

39:00.380 --> 39:02.090
Why would anyone
do such a thing?

39:02.257 --> 39:04.801
I think to make it look like
the Chartists mean revolution.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.470
And they don't?

39:06.636 --> 39:09.264
All we want is the Charter,
ma'am.

39:09.431 --> 39:10.992
But if there are soldiers
on the streets,

39:11.016 --> 39:12.684
and-and cannons on every bridge,

39:12.851 --> 39:14.662
then people get to thinking
that it's a battle.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.366
But you said the Chartists
weren't violent.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.273
If we're attacked
we won't run away, ma'am!

39:18.440 --> 39:19.834
You can't talk
to the queen like that.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.569
It's all right, Skerrett.

39:22.736 --> 39:25.655
I don't think you meant
to be rude.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.657
No, ma'am.

39:36.333 --> 39:40.003
I know you want what's best
for your people, ma'am.

39:44.591 --> 39:45.985
Every day there's a new reason
why we cannot leave.

39:46.009 --> 39:48.178
What if she's right, Albert?

39:48.345 --> 39:51.014
And the guns were put there
by somebody else?

39:51.181 --> 39:53.683
Victoria,
I know that this distresses you,

39:53.850 --> 39:55.050
but who would do such a thing?

39:55.143 --> 39:56.478
It makes no sense.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.581
If someone wanted to discredit
the Chartists, then...

39:58.605 --> 40:00.023
Look at the facts!

40:00.190 --> 40:02.150
On the one hand we have
the story of a seamstress,

40:02.317 --> 40:04.194
on the other hand
we have rifles.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.537
I think we have to accept
the truth, Victoria,

40:07.614 --> 40:10.075
however unwelcome it may seem.

40:18.208 --> 40:22.337
My sister has always lived
in a world of her own making.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.104
When she was little
I think she preferred

40:24.214 --> 40:26.758
to talk to her dolls than to me,

40:26.925 --> 40:29.136
because they would not
answer back.

40:29.302 --> 40:31.721
She wants to see the best
in her people.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.015
I cannot fault her for that.

40:34.182 --> 40:37.644
<i>S'?</i>

40:51.408 --> 40:56.288
<i>S'?</i>

41:15.098 --> 41:19.978
<i>S'?</i>

41:32.574 --> 41:37.454
<i>S'?</i>

41:40.373 --> 41:44.002
<i>S'?</i>

42:00.769 --> 42:05.273
<i>S'?</i>

42:09.694 --> 42:13.865
<i>S'?</i>

42:21.915 --> 42:25.085
<i>S'?</i>

42:25.252 --> 42:26.836
Men will be stationed
on every bridge.

42:27.003 --> 42:31.550
We cannot let these
ruffians come near Parliament

42:31.716 --> 42:33.218
or the palace.

42:33.385 --> 42:36.555
The future of this country...

42:38.306 --> 42:40.100
lies in your hands.

42:40.267 --> 42:44.729
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

42:44.896 --> 42:46.648
Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

42:46.815 --> 42:51.027
<i>S'?</i>

42:58.326 --> 43:01.663
<i>S'?</i>

43:01.830 --> 43:03.915
<i>You will be traveling
in the opposite direction</i>

43:04.082 --> 43:05.208
<i>to the Chartists.</i>

43:08.795 --> 43:11.423
<i>The prime minister
and the foreign secretary</i>

43:11.590 --> 43:14.259
<i>will accompany us to the bridge.</i>

43:16.511 --> 43:18.888
<i>Once you have crossed
Waterloo Bridge,</i>

43:19.055 --> 43:21.182
we will make sure that no one
comes the other way.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.727
<i>My troops have their orders.</i>

43:23.893 --> 43:27.147
<i>The Chartists will not
cross the river.</i>

43:27.314 --> 43:28.982
<i>"ALBERT". Waterloo Bridge.</i>

43:30.483 --> 43:32.736
I hope that is a good omen,
Duke.

43:34.904 --> 43:39.993
I prefer an enemy in uniform,
sir.

43:40.160 --> 43:47.042
<i>S'?</i>

43:51.171 --> 43:58.011
<i>S'?</i>

43:58.178 --> 44:00.597
Why are there so many soldiers?

44:00.764 --> 44:02.474
Get away!

44:02.641 --> 44:03.641
Go!

44:03.767 --> 44:05.060
Let go of me!

44:05.226 --> 44:07.771
<i>S'?</i>

44:30.168 --> 44:31.294
Stop the carriage.

44:31.461 --> 44:32.545
Albert, stop the carriage!

44:33.713 --> 44:34.839
Stop the carriage!

44:37.634 --> 44:39.761
I need to get out.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.604
<i>S'?</i>

45:02.075 --> 45:04.828
I have changed my mind, Duke.

45:04.994 --> 45:07.914
A woman's prerogative, ma'am.

45:08.081 --> 45:09.332
The Chartists must be able

45:09.499 --> 45:11.059
to present their petition
to Parliament.

45:11.084 --> 45:14.754
I think that
that is unwise, ma'am.

45:14.921 --> 45:17.465
If we let them over the bridge,
there will be no stopping them.

45:17.632 --> 45:19.050
We don't know that, Duke.

45:19.217 --> 45:20.051
But we do, ma'am.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.261
How many rifles were found

45:21.428 --> 45:22.512
at Kennington Hall?

45:22.679 --> 45:23.972
Was it 400, or was it 500?

45:24.139 --> 45:26.558
I assume that rifles
are costly items, Duke?

45:26.725 --> 45:28.184
I wonder then

45:28.351 --> 45:30.061
how Chartists,
who are working men,

45:30.228 --> 45:31.354
could afford so many?

45:33.148 --> 45:35.692
They are desperate men, ma'am.

45:35.859 --> 45:40.321
Or perhaps the rifles
were put there by somebody else?

45:40.488 --> 45:43.324
What do you think,
Lord Palmerston?

45:45.201 --> 45:47.361
Are you familiar of the notion
of Occam's razor, ma'am?

45:48.788 --> 45:50.415
You have two ideas... one simple,

45:50.582 --> 45:53.543
and the other based on a series
of unlikely suppositions.

45:53.710 --> 45:56.713
The simple theory is always

45:56.880 --> 45:59.007
more likely to be true.

45:59.174 --> 46:00.508
Victoria, please, let us go.

46:04.763 --> 46:07.140
You see,

46:07.307 --> 46:09.517
I don't find it at all unlikely

46:09.684 --> 46:11.853
that the rifles could have been
put there by...

46:12.020 --> 46:13.772
parties...

46:13.938 --> 46:16.024
anxious to prove
the Chartists guilty.

46:16.191 --> 46:19.235
<i>S'?</i>

46:23.740 --> 46:24.991
The petition must go ahead.

46:28.495 --> 46:29.704
As you wish, ma'am.

46:39.130 --> 46:42.217
How the devil did she find out?

46:42.383 --> 46:45.261
Perhaps you're not the only one
with a popular touch, Henry.

46:45.428 --> 46:50.308
<i>S'?</i>

47:12.747 --> 47:16.292
<i>S'?</i>

47:34.269 --> 47:37.939
<i>S'?</i>

47:41.985 --> 47:46.698
<i>S'?</i>

47:55.748 --> 47:58.334
<i>S'?</i>

48:00.712 --> 48:02.630
Take aim!

48:07.969 --> 48:09.262
Prepare to fire!

48:20.398 --> 48:21.524
Sergeant.

48:25.069 --> 48:26.321
Let them pass.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.203
<i>S'?</i>

48:34.370 --> 48:36.623
Company!

48:36.789 --> 48:37.916
Withdraw!

48:40.126 --> 48:43.713
<i>S'?</i>

48:55.683 --> 49:00.813
<i>S'?</i>

49:15.244 --> 49:17.288
<i>S'?</i>

49:18.873 --> 49:22.919
<i>S'?</i>

49:34.013 --> 49:37.976
<i>S'?</i>

49:46.109 --> 49:51.114
<i>S'?</i>

49:51.280 --> 49:52.407
I can't wait to see.

49:52.573 --> 49:53.933
Mr. Penge's face
when you tell him.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.118
No, not a word.

49:55.284 --> 49:56.828
I don't want anyone to know yet.

49:58.287 --> 50:00.039
Not until the queen is safe.

50:00.206 --> 50:02.375
A honeymoon
in the Isle of Wight!

50:04.210 --> 50:08.798
<i>S'?</i>

50:13.928 --> 50:15.013
Look!

50:15.179 --> 50:17.974
Coming, Bertie!

50:18.141 --> 50:19.851
<i>S'?</i>

50:22.228 --> 50:23.438
Look at this!

50:27.108 --> 50:30.069
<i>S'?</i>

50:33.406 --> 50:34.490
Come with me.

50:34.657 --> 50:36.117
I want to show you something.

50:44.959 --> 50:46.085
What is it?

50:52.216 --> 50:54.802
It's Hercules, the hero,

50:54.969 --> 50:59.348
being held in bondage
by Queen Omphale.

50:59.515 --> 51:02.143
So instead of killing lions...

51:04.187 --> 51:07.857
he is... helping her spin.

51:08.024 --> 51:09.942
<i>S'?</i>

51:10.109 --> 51:13.112
I bought it so I can lie
in the bath

51:13.279 --> 51:15.615
and then think of you.

51:17.617 --> 51:22.622
But Osborne
is your kingdom, Albert.

51:22.789 --> 51:25.875
<i>S'?</i>

51:26.042 --> 51:27.835
Forgive me for disturbing you.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.712
This came.

51:29.879 --> 51:32.131
It's from the duke.

51:54.362 --> 51:55.962
The Chartists delivered
their petition...

51:58.324 --> 51:59.742
without incident.

52:02.078 --> 52:05.373
Then you were right, Liebes.

52:05.540 --> 52:07.583
It seems the English people
are not revolutionary...

52:07.750 --> 52:10.294
I should have been there,
Albert!

52:13.422 --> 52:14.549
Excuse me.

52:16.092 --> 52:17.176
I should have been there!

52:20.263 --> 52:21.806
She will feel better soon.

52:24.308 --> 52:25.434
I hope so.

52:31.858 --> 52:34.277
We can take care of her...

52:34.443 --> 52:35.570
together.

52:43.661 --> 52:48.541

52:58.843 --> 53:02.471

53:08.603 --> 53:12.815

53:20.448 --> 53:25.119
<i>S'?</i>

53:47.600 --> 53:54.440
J " Gloriana J".

54:01.614 --> 54:08.329
J " Gloriana, hallelujah J"
