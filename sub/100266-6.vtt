00:28.118 --> 00:31.877
- Some seeds
- are more predictable than others.

00:31.878 --> 00:34.962
We plant them and they send
up shoots.

00:35.998 --> 00:38.316
Well done, May.

00:38.318 --> 00:41.717
We water them
and then we watch them grow.

00:41.718 --> 00:45.797
They reward us with abundance,
with joy, with pleasure,

00:45.798 --> 00:48.298
in the rhythms of life itself.

00:49.198 --> 00:50.636
Go on, then.

00:50.638 --> 00:53.437
Water them and they will flourish.

00:53.438 --> 00:56.436
Nurture them and they will thrive.

00:56.438 --> 00:58.276
I'll show you!

00:58.278 --> 01:00.116
Warrgh!

01:00.118 --> 01:04.477
Love and light and rain and air
are all they need.

01:05.558 --> 01:07.438
I'll show you.

01:23.118 --> 01:25.118
Take a seat, Mrs Arthur.

01:27.358 --> 01:29.717
Good afternoon, Miss Higgins.

01:29.718 --> 01:31.677
How nice to see you again.

01:31.678 --> 01:34.837
Dr McNulty, you weren't expected
until tomorrow.

01:34.838 --> 01:36.557
Well, my train got in at
two o'clock,

01:36.558 --> 01:38.477
and Tuesday clinics being
what they are,

01:38.478 --> 01:40.597
I thought an extra pair of hands
might not go amiss.

01:40.598 --> 01:42.677
Well, I don't think Dr Turner will
have time to...

01:42.678 --> 01:44.317
Dr McNulty! Welcome.

01:44.318 --> 01:48.597
Just passing, or is there a
white coat in one of those bags?

01:48.598 --> 01:52.432
- You'll have to move
- that luggage.

01:53.598 --> 01:55.516
Yes, Miss Higgins.

01:55.518 --> 01:57.436
Hmm.

01:57.438 --> 02:02.157
I'm pleased to report a very healthy
mother. Won't be long now.

02:02.158 --> 02:05.117
I think you might even
go into labour this week.

02:05.118 --> 02:09.795
Oh, good. Cos I want it to
be Thursday.

02:09.798 --> 02:12.156
It was my dad's birthday...

02:12.158 --> 02:13.677
...and his dad's, and...

02:13.678 --> 02:15.557
...I just got my heart set on this
one coming

02:15.558 --> 02:18.276
on the 12th of August too.

02:18.278 --> 02:20.518
Can you do something?

02:22.038 --> 02:25.477
I've heard you sometimes give people
castor oil to bring it on.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.597
Only if they're very overdue,

02:27.598 --> 02:30.517
and according to your records,
you're not.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.437
Well, I'd like a
second opinion, please.

02:33.438 --> 02:35.437
I'd like to see Nurse Dyer.

02:35.438 --> 02:38.197
Nurse Dyer may be a
relative, Maureen,

02:38.198 --> 02:39.844
but she's also a
professional midwife

02:39.845 --> 02:41.900
and she won't tell
you anything different.

02:41.901 --> 02:42.965
Hmm.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.437
- Oh, goodness, what a lovely welcome!
- Hello, you two.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.917
May's a bit worried that you'd
got lost.

02:52.918 --> 02:56.037
Oh, dear, I'm sorry we're a
little late.

02:56.038 --> 02:59.237
- Look what we've got for pudding.
- Ah!

02:59.238 --> 03:01.996
- Raspberry ripple!
- Yeah!

03:01.998 --> 03:05.317
I'd better get it in the fridge
before it melts.

03:05.318 --> 03:08.037
- Thank you for baby-sitting.
- There were a few telephone calls.

03:08.038 --> 03:10.357
One of them was from the
Hong Kong Adoption Project.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.197
Oh, that's good. What did they say?

03:12.198 --> 03:14.557
They just asked you to
telephone them back.

03:14.558 --> 03:17.317
It's too late now. I'll do
it tomorrow.

03:17.318 --> 03:20.357
Might be the date for May's
adoption hearing.

03:20.358 --> 03:24.237
We are delighted to have you with
us again, Dr McNulty.

03:24.238 --> 03:27.357
We've even broken out the lemon
barley water in your honour.

03:27.358 --> 03:30.077
I hope you'll be comfortable
enough upstairs.

03:30.078 --> 03:32.277
I'm sorry it's the attic room.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.317
The attic room is perfect, Sister.

03:34.318 --> 03:36.757
Thank you for having me
at such short notice.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.757
The lodgings I'd secured turned out
to be earmarked for demolition

03:39.758 --> 03:41.157
in a couple of weeks.

03:41.158 --> 03:45.075
Rather a common occurrence
in Poplar these days.

03:45.718 --> 03:49.037
But not here, you'll be relieved
to know.

03:49.038 --> 03:53.038
We shall probably still be here
in the year 2000!

03:54.078 --> 03:57.436
No, we won't.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.076
Neither will Nonnatus House.

04:00.078 --> 04:04.636
At some point in the next year,
we will be forced out,

04:04.638 --> 04:07.596
and the building knocked down.

04:07.598 --> 04:09.757
How long have you known about this?

04:09.758 --> 04:11.156
Since January.

04:11.158 --> 04:12.717
I had decided not to break the news

04:12.718 --> 04:15.797
until I had received firm notice
of the date.

04:15.798 --> 04:18.076
Having heard nothing, I...

04:18.077 --> 04:21.837
...I see no point in keeping it a
secret any longer.

04:21.838 --> 04:27.876
However, I appreciate
Sister Hilda's... efforts.

04:27.878 --> 04:31.518
I can only plead my vow
of obedience.

04:32.758 --> 04:34.558
Shall we say grace?

04:42.118 --> 04:44.557
I've been thinking about Angela.

04:44.558 --> 04:46.797
I know we were going to wait until
she was older

04:46.798 --> 04:48.917
to talk to her about
being adopted,

04:48.918 --> 04:53.276
but when everything's had to be so
open with May,

04:53.278 --> 04:55.917
it doesn't seem fair that one of
them has more information

04:55.918 --> 04:57.676
than the other.

04:57.678 --> 04:59.956
No, it doesn't.

04:59.958 --> 05:02.597
I think we should talk to her soon.

05:02.598 --> 05:04.757
Do you think she'll understand?

05:04.758 --> 05:07.157
She's such a happy little thing.

05:07.158 --> 05:09.637
It would be awful to upset her.

05:09.638 --> 05:13.722
She's seen what the word "adoption"
means for May.

05:14.038 --> 05:18.158
That she's loved. That we'll always
be her family.

05:19.318 --> 05:22.117
And you know how they like to be
the same.

05:22.118 --> 05:24.876
Hmm.

05:24.878 --> 05:27.277
It's all well and good for
the Sisters

05:27.278 --> 05:29.797
they've got the motherhouse to
go to.

05:29.798 --> 05:31.918
But this is our home.

05:32.918 --> 05:35.797
Cream Line Toffees
from a grateful patient!

05:35.798 --> 05:38.236
I think we'd best tuck in.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.597
Other lodgings won't be easy to
come by,

05:40.598 --> 05:42.477
even if we could afford the rent,

05:42.478 --> 05:45.597
which we can't if we're all out
of work.

05:45.598 --> 05:49.117
Perhaps the Sisters will
just move and carry on.

05:49.118 --> 05:52.597
They moved here when the old
Nonnatus was knocked down,

05:52.598 --> 05:55.598
and things continued much
the same...

05:57.518 --> 06:00.676
...apart from maybe a few more rats.

06:00.678 --> 06:02.598
And a few less babies!

06:03.958 --> 06:06.877
The Pill's winning every
popularity contest going,

06:06.878 --> 06:09.397
and the council's putting as much
money into family planning

06:09.398 --> 06:10.917
as it is midwifery.

06:10.918 --> 06:13.597
What if they stop supporting
the Order?

06:13.598 --> 06:16.848
Then the Order can't afford to
carry on.

06:18.878 --> 06:22.357
At least we'll be in the same boat
as everyone else round here.

06:22.358 --> 06:24.077
Everyone's up to their
eyes in rubble,

06:24.078 --> 06:26.957
and nobody knows what the
future holds.

06:26.958 --> 06:29.542
Just going to have to carry on.

06:40.518 --> 06:42.717
My dad used to enter
the horticultural show

06:42.718 --> 06:44.197
every summer bank holiday.

06:44.198 --> 06:46.277
He always thought
he was going to win something.

06:46.278 --> 06:47.878
Never ever did.

06:49.318 --> 06:51.636
Bit like Fred, really.

06:51.638 --> 06:53.957
You know, we should go along
if it's a nice day.

06:53.958 --> 06:55.677
There's always a lot of good
home bakes.

06:55.678 --> 06:58.237
- Hey, I bet Cyril would like it.
- I expect he would.

06:58.238 --> 07:00.716
But he'll probably be busy.

07:00.718 --> 07:04.557
Well, all the more reason for us
to arrange a nice day out.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.278
Hmm!

07:10.598 --> 07:13.278
- Ready for blastoff?
- Yes, sir.

07:20.718 --> 07:24.237
Mrs Hamid and young Master Rizwan
to Dr Turner, please.

07:24.238 --> 07:26.796
- Come along.
- Mr Prentice?

07:26.798 --> 07:30.036
- Yep.
- You're with Dr McNulty.

07:30.038 --> 07:31.717
Hello, Mr Prentice, I'm...

07:31.718 --> 07:35.436
Cor blimey! It's like
policemen, innit?

07:35.438 --> 07:39.688
Just kidding. Come on, son,
you show me where to go.

07:39.798 --> 07:42.156
- Dad!
- Watch the road!

07:42.158 --> 07:43.756
Hello, monsters!

07:45.118 --> 07:47.118
Come on. Come on.

07:50.118 --> 07:52.316
All right, love?

07:52.318 --> 07:54.117
I thought you were in
Limehouse today?

07:54.118 --> 07:55.637
Church in Limehouse next.

07:55.638 --> 07:59.437
You want me to put in a good word
about your due date while I'm there?

07:59.438 --> 08:02.837
If you like. I think my plan's got
a better chance of working.

08:02.838 --> 08:04.596
Castor oil.

08:04.598 --> 08:08.637
- Oh, you're so cheeky.
- I know. It's why you love me.

08:08.638 --> 08:10.356
Come here.

08:10.358 --> 08:13.116
Get off! Dad's got work. Come on.

08:13.118 --> 08:16.797
- Go on, you two. Look after your mum.
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.

08:16.798 --> 08:18.597
- Look after her.
- They will.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.598
Can you get on the pavement, please?

08:24.918 --> 08:27.037
- Turner residence.
- It's Miss Williams.

08:27.038 --> 08:29.437
Oh, hello, Miss Williams.
I was just about to call you.

08:29.438 --> 08:32.677
- Do we have a hearing date?
- There's been a slight complication.

08:32.678 --> 08:34.797
Oh. What sort of complication?

08:34.798 --> 08:37.116
I don't want to worry you unduly,
Mrs Turner,

08:37.118 --> 08:39.116
as it probably won't affect things
long term,

08:39.118 --> 08:41.077
but a woman has contacted the office

08:41.078 --> 08:44.197
who seems to have quite a credible
claim to being May's mother.

08:44.198 --> 08:45.756
What?

08:45.758 --> 08:49.997
We were told that person became
deceased more than two years ago.

08:49.998 --> 08:54.317
As were we all, but it would appear
that she's alive and well.

08:54.318 --> 08:57.197
Apparently her drug addiction is now
behind her

08:57.198 --> 08:59.117
and she's working as an amah,

08:59.118 --> 09:01.997
caring for the children
of a British Forces family.

09:01.998 --> 09:03.877
They're here in London on furlough.

09:03.878 --> 09:04.956
Miss Tang.

09:04.958 --> 09:08.437
Miss Tang, could you wait in the
corridor for a moment?

09:08.438 --> 09:10.557
- She's with you now?
- Sorry, yes.

09:10.558 --> 09:12.237
She's back again today.

09:12.238 --> 09:15.237
Look, I really don't think she means
to disrupt the adoption,

09:15.238 --> 09:20.196
but she has asked to meet you
and your husband, and...

09:20.198 --> 09:23.282
...she would like to see
her daughter.

09:24.238 --> 09:26.905
Mrs Turner, are you still there?

09:27.638 --> 09:30.596
Oh, no!

09:30.598 --> 09:32.158
Hold this, son.

09:34.958 --> 09:37.036
Cancelled?!

09:38.078 --> 09:40.828
Come on, son. Let's sort
this out.

09:42.798 --> 09:45.678
Oh, Patrick. Thank goodness.

09:47.118 --> 09:49.277
I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

09:49.278 --> 09:52.278
- Have you heard anything else?
- No.

09:52.798 --> 09:55.477
She said it won't affect
the adoption,

09:55.478 --> 09:59.477
but if there's been a mistake,
I don't see how it can't.

09:59.478 --> 10:03.197
All the children on the project
were supposed to be orphans.

10:03.198 --> 10:05.397
I can't bear the thought of
losing her.

10:05.398 --> 10:07.758
- I know.
- Come here.

10:10.518 --> 10:14.957
The East End's always had such
a great tradition of gardening,

10:14.958 --> 10:17.957
and now so much of it's been built
over, I just...

10:17.958 --> 10:19.597
You know, well, I mean,

10:19.598 --> 10:22.517
I just thought it was important to
try and keep it going.

10:22.518 --> 10:24.157
I don't disagree, love,

10:24.158 --> 10:26.837
but if you're going to have a
horticultural show,

10:26.838 --> 10:29.837
then you've got to have
some horticulture to go in it.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.672
You could have exhibition gardens.

10:35.558 --> 10:38.556
That's a good idea, Reggie...

10:38.558 --> 10:40.677
...but a bit too ambitious.

10:40.678 --> 10:42.557
I'm sorry, Fred, love, but...

10:42.558 --> 10:46.892
...this time it really is up to you.

10:49.118 --> 10:50.556
Ugh!

10:50.558 --> 10:53.516
Oh! That's horrible.

10:53.518 --> 10:55.957
Do you want a fag to put away
the taste?

10:55.958 --> 10:57.718
No. Water.

11:05.278 --> 11:08.478
So... how long does it take, then?

11:09.478 --> 11:14.036
- You know, to work?
- Dunno. Why? You excited?

11:14.038 --> 11:15.876
Of course. Zzzt!

11:15.878 --> 11:18.956
Another little Bryant. Be lovely.

11:18.958 --> 11:24.556
Yeah. And it's going to be
tomorrow, Charlie. I can feel it.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.317
I always hated that Dad
never got to see the kids,

11:27.318 --> 11:29.317
and this one coming on
his birthday -

11:29.318 --> 11:31.437
it'll be like a connection,
won't it?

11:31.438 --> 11:34.717
A special family thing
right back to Grandad.

11:34.718 --> 11:35.916
Yeah.

11:35.918 --> 11:37.836
Love you.

11:37.838 --> 11:39.596
You too.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.396
What?

11:42.398 --> 11:44.316
- Has it happened?
- No.

11:44.318 --> 11:46.276
Pregnancy wind.

11:46.278 --> 11:48.476
Sorry, love.

11:48.478 --> 11:49.998
Right.

11:52.158 --> 11:54.917
Ah! That was
Maureen Bryant's husband.

11:54.918 --> 11:56.877
She seems to be getting her wish.

11:56.878 --> 11:59.636
Waters broke this morning
at 6.20.

11:59.638 --> 12:01.438
Righto.

12:03.358 --> 12:05.756
Seems very convenient.

12:05.758 --> 12:08.477
You don't suppose she dosed up
on castor oil herself, do you?

12:08.478 --> 12:13.145
Well, if she has, she'll be
discovering the consequences.

12:20.718 --> 12:22.358
No.

12:39.838 --> 12:41.677
Hello. Where's your mum?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.198
Over there.

12:51.918 --> 12:54.318
Oi.

13:01.638 --> 13:03.556
Come on.

13:03.558 --> 13:08.796
Oh, my God. I think my baby's
going to be born in that privy.

13:08.798 --> 13:12.037
No, it won't. You're about 30
minutes between contractions.

13:12.038 --> 13:13.756
You've got ages yet.

13:13.758 --> 13:15.917
I didn't think castor oil
was going to do this!

13:15.918 --> 13:19.597
Well, what else was it going to do?
It's castor oil!

13:19.598 --> 13:21.117
Will the baby be all right?

13:21.118 --> 13:23.796
Yeah. Course it will.

13:23.798 --> 13:27.437
Oh, I just really, really want it
to be today.

13:27.438 --> 13:29.476
I know.

13:29.478 --> 13:32.316
The Glorious Twelfth.

13:32.318 --> 13:37.036
Thing is, Mo, your baby's
going to do what it feels like.

13:37.038 --> 13:40.838
And your dad would be proud of
you whatever.

13:43.278 --> 13:45.317
On behalf of the Order, I cannot
tell you

13:45.318 --> 13:47.477
how sorry I am that this
has happened.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.477
However the original mistake
was made,

13:49.478 --> 13:51.477
your family would never have
been involved

13:51.478 --> 13:53.197
were it not for our actions.

13:53.198 --> 13:56.517
Involvement isn't something we
regret, Sister Julienne.

13:56.518 --> 13:59.877
Poor May. This is going to be
incredibly confusing for her.

13:59.878 --> 14:01.837
We haven't told her yet.

14:01.838 --> 14:04.717
We thought it best to find out
a little more

14:04.718 --> 14:06.997
about Miss Tang and her
intentions first.

14:06.998 --> 14:09.276
I think that's wise.

14:09.278 --> 14:12.157
It may be that Miss Tang wants
nothing more than reassurance

14:12.158 --> 14:14.678
that May is well and happy.

14:16.998 --> 14:19.396
Hello there, Mr Buckle.

14:19.398 --> 14:20.916
Oh, hello, Sister.

14:20.918 --> 14:25.168
Goodness, everything all right?
You look a bit glum.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.517
You ever felt like you've bitten off
more than you can chew, Sister?

14:29.518 --> 14:32.398
Oh, quite frequently.

14:40.158 --> 14:43.837
I usually find that spreading
the load around a bit is the answer.

14:43.838 --> 14:47.276
I'm sure we can find you
some volunteers.

14:47.278 --> 14:49.358
Don't worry!

15:01.958 --> 15:04.837
I'm ready for the ward round
if you are, Sister.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.677
Yes. Just coming, Doctor.

15:06.678 --> 15:08.757
Is that aspirin? Are you unwell?

15:08.758 --> 15:11.342
No, no, nothing to worry about.

15:12.998 --> 15:14.518
Dr McNulty.

15:15.998 --> 15:20.997
This is sputum. And yet I found it
in the box for blood samples,

15:20.998 --> 15:24.677
which would cause a great deal
of confusion at the laboratory.

15:24.678 --> 15:26.797
I'm sorry, Miss Higgins,
it won't happen again.

15:26.798 --> 15:30.157
Very well, but if Dr Turner
is to leave you unsupervised,

15:30.158 --> 15:33.598
you must be au fait with
the systems.

15:37.958 --> 15:40.957
Don't worry. Her bark's worse
than her bite.

15:40.958 --> 15:43.477
I'm not sure she realises I'm
an adult.

15:43.478 --> 15:45.812
It'll get better, I promise.

15:48.358 --> 15:51.317
It's not that I've got no
entries, it's just that,

15:51.318 --> 15:54.037
well, I ain't got many,
and I've only got three weeks.

15:54.038 --> 15:58.197
Don't be despondent, Mr Buckle.
Inspiration will descend.

15:58.198 --> 16:01.077
Well, I can certainly
provide some floral decorations.

16:01.078 --> 16:03.197
My godmother will be delighted

16:03.198 --> 16:05.597
if my Constance Spry training comes
in useful at last!

16:05.598 --> 16:08.157
You can teach us, Trixie,
and we can all have a go.

16:08.158 --> 16:09.396
Mmm.

16:09.398 --> 16:13.477
What we need is something
that will really grab attention.

16:13.478 --> 16:15.477
Make people want to be part of it.

16:15.478 --> 16:17.556
Like exhibition gardens.

16:17.558 --> 16:19.676
The Chelsea Flower Show.

16:19.678 --> 16:23.077
- I saw it in a magazine.
- What do you mean, Reggie?

16:23.078 --> 16:26.237
Different gardens for
different people.

16:26.238 --> 16:29.397
Hang on. Maybe we could do
something like that with the Cubs.

16:29.398 --> 16:32.477
Get them involved. Have a
campfire party.

16:32.478 --> 16:35.717
The boys are always in the market
for a good feed and a singsong!

16:35.718 --> 16:39.037
And I'm sure Miss Nadine's
dance school could do something.

16:39.038 --> 16:43.797
Maybe country dancing, and I can
make 'em some peasant dresses?

16:43.798 --> 16:47.796
Country dancing in an
English garden!

16:47.798 --> 16:50.156
You're a genius, Reggie.

16:50.158 --> 16:53.356
Oh, thank you so much.

16:53.358 --> 16:56.636
Oh, I feel so much better already.

16:56.638 --> 16:58.597
And the best is yet to come.

16:58.598 --> 17:00.436
St Raymond Nonnatus.

17:00.438 --> 17:01.996
Sorry, Sister?

17:01.998 --> 17:06.077
Well, as you are aware,
Mr Buckle, St Raymond Nonnatus

17:06.078 --> 17:08.277
is the patron saint of midwives,

17:08.278 --> 17:11.797
and his feast day
is the day after bank holiday.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.317
We could make a magnificent garden
for St Raymond Nonnatus

17:15.318 --> 17:17.356
in celebration!

17:17.358 --> 17:20.797
It will elicit blessings
on the whole event.

17:20.798 --> 17:23.357
That's a wonderful idea, Sister.

17:23.358 --> 17:26.238
And I shall create it myself.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.478
Mmm.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.838
Hmm.

17:37.918 --> 17:40.476
Come in.

17:40.478 --> 17:44.077
Mr Bryant again. I think she's
definitely ready for us this time.

17:44.078 --> 17:48.116
Oh, third baby? She might just
do it, hmm?

17:48.118 --> 17:51.636
You're doing so well.

17:51.638 --> 17:56.276
Fantastic work.

17:56.278 --> 17:58.836
Yeah, that's the stuff.

17:58.838 --> 18:01.156
You've got it.

18:01.158 --> 18:04.076
Ooh!

18:08.238 --> 18:10.757
Don't worry, my darling.

18:10.758 --> 18:12.556
Baby's on its way.

18:12.558 --> 18:15.998
What time is it?
Are we going to make it?

18:18.278 --> 18:20.278
Can you pant for me, Mo?

18:22.998 --> 18:24.636
That's it. Good.

18:24.638 --> 18:27.437
Just keep breathing, precious.
You are so nearly there.

18:27.438 --> 18:32.278
You can do this, Mo. One more now.
Slowly, slowly.

18:37.118 --> 18:40.318
That's it, Maureen. Head's on
its way.

18:41.398 --> 18:43.558
One for me now.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.396
Well done, Mo.

18:49.398 --> 18:51.237
Baby's head's in my hand.

18:51.238 --> 18:53.822
Just keep it gentle. All right?

18:58.958 --> 19:02.078
Well done, Mo.

19:05.598 --> 19:07.637
Congratulations, Maureen.

19:07.638 --> 19:10.838
You have a lovely baby boy.

19:11.998 --> 19:14.318
Oh, can I see him?

19:28.838 --> 19:32.756
Yeah. Lovely boy.

19:32.758 --> 19:34.518
Oh!

19:36.038 --> 19:38.116
Hello, sweetheart.

19:38.118 --> 19:40.876
Oh, look how tiny you are.

19:40.878 --> 19:44.077
I thought you were going to be a
right little bruiser after all that!

19:44.078 --> 19:47.917
He is absolutely beautiful.
And do you know what?

19:47.918 --> 19:50.716
You did it, Mo! You did it, girl!

19:50.718 --> 19:53.317
Born the same day as your dad
and your grandad!

19:53.318 --> 19:55.877
You are not supposed to be in here
yet, Charlie Bryant.

19:55.878 --> 19:58.996
Sorry, Val. I mean, Nurse.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.236
Seeing as you are...

20:01.238 --> 20:03.077
...do you want to come and meet
your son?

20:03.078 --> 20:05.316
Yes!

20:05.318 --> 20:07.638
Oooh!

20:15.038 --> 20:17.918
He's absolutely perfect.

20:29.358 --> 20:33.037
I would be more than happy to help
you organise this garden, Sister.

20:33.038 --> 20:36.437
It does seem rather a large
undertaking for one person alone.

20:36.438 --> 20:39.676
But I am not alone, Sister.

20:39.678 --> 20:41.716
Never fear.

20:41.718 --> 20:45.718
St Raymond and I have the situation
well in hand.

20:53.958 --> 20:56.636
- You're up early.
- So are you.

20:56.638 --> 20:58.436
I'm a bit nervous.

20:58.438 --> 21:01.117
So am I, and I'm not even
meeting her.

21:01.118 --> 21:02.756
I wish nobody was!

21:02.758 --> 21:06.756
Oh, Tim... It must be awful for
her too.

21:06.758 --> 21:10.437
I know. I thought you chose
photographs last night.

21:10.438 --> 21:13.197
I did. But I'm not sure
they're the right ones.

21:13.198 --> 21:16.277
I want to reassure Miss Tang
that May is happy.

21:16.278 --> 21:20.195
But if she looks too happy,
is that insensitive?

21:20.838 --> 21:24.922
No-one else's family
seems to be this complicated.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.618
I like that we're complicated.

21:29.718 --> 21:32.436
Pleased to meet you.

21:32.438 --> 21:34.636
Please sit down.

21:34.638 --> 21:37.357
Miss Tang is now using
an English Christian name,

21:37.358 --> 21:39.357
- aren't you, dear?
- Esther.

21:39.358 --> 21:41.717
I've explained that we were
all under the impression

21:41.718 --> 21:43.237
that she had passed away.

21:43.238 --> 21:45.716
I nearly did.

21:45.718 --> 21:48.517
I did not live a good life for
many years.

21:48.518 --> 21:50.518
But it is different now.

21:52.598 --> 21:54.558
How is my...?

21:56.918 --> 21:58.478
How is May?

21:59.518 --> 22:02.956
She's absolutely lovely, Miss Tang.

22:02.958 --> 22:05.236
I have some photographs...

22:05.238 --> 22:07.572
...if you would like to see.

22:09.118 --> 22:11.556
So big!

22:11.558 --> 22:14.076
So pretty.

22:14.078 --> 22:16.196
She looks like you.

22:16.198 --> 22:18.157
- She go to school?
- Yes.

22:18.158 --> 22:21.877
She likes counting,
and she's learning to read.

22:21.878 --> 22:24.837
She looks very happy in
the photographs, doesn't she?

22:24.838 --> 22:26.518
Yes.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.196
This is... They're very nice.

22:34.198 --> 22:37.198
No, please. We brought them for you.

22:37.918 --> 22:41.038
Thank you. This is very kind.

22:44.158 --> 22:47.597
But I would also like to see
her not in picture.

22:47.598 --> 22:50.596
Please... can I see my daughter?

22:50.598 --> 22:52.037
Well, what we have to do today

22:52.038 --> 22:54.677
is decide just what is in May's
best interests.

22:54.678 --> 22:59.678
But she will miss me. A daughter
must want to see her mother.

23:01.438 --> 23:04.637
Please. I am only in England for a
few weeks.

23:04.638 --> 23:08.055
This could be the last chance I
ever have.

23:13.438 --> 23:15.957
He hasn't got the hang of
feeding yet.

23:15.958 --> 23:18.077
Not like my other two
greedy monsters.

23:18.078 --> 23:21.677
I'm sure he will, but we'll keep
an eye on it.

23:21.678 --> 23:26.357
And if he struggles, we can always
try a bottle to top him up.

23:26.358 --> 23:28.997
He seems a contented little
chap, anyway.

23:28.998 --> 23:31.556
Yeah. Yes.

23:31.558 --> 23:35.156
Warren's lovely, isn't he?

23:35.158 --> 23:37.877
She was nice, wasn't she?

23:37.878 --> 23:41.156
Yes. Very.

23:41.158 --> 23:44.637
Do you think we did the right
thing? Agreeing?

23:44.638 --> 23:46.277
I don't doubt for a moment

23:46.278 --> 23:49.695
that we've done the right thing
by Esther.

23:50.878 --> 23:54.545
I just hope it's also the right
thing by May.

23:56.718 --> 23:59.385
These are the papers of consent.

24:02.998 --> 24:06.877
You need to sign them to agree
to May's adoption by the Turners...

24:06.878 --> 24:09.517
...like we talked about
the other day.

24:09.518 --> 24:13.156
So that May will have the security
of a...

24:13.158 --> 24:15.575
...permanent family and home.

24:16.118 --> 24:18.558
I cannot read them.

24:19.598 --> 24:24.182
Well, if you like, I could
go through them with you now?

24:26.278 --> 24:28.518
I must go back to work.

24:32.798 --> 24:38.476
The Hanging Gardens
of Babylon... via Poplar.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.636
Fred Buckle! Have you been drinking?

24:41.638 --> 24:44.436
Only in the line of duty, ma'am.

24:44.438 --> 24:48.996
We had quite a few signed up
in the Black Sail. Hm?

24:48.998 --> 24:51.396
But Reggie is a genius.

24:51.398 --> 24:53.596
Well, we knew that!

24:53.598 --> 24:56.277
- We went up to the new flats, didn't we?
- Yeah.

24:56.278 --> 24:58.516
Yeah. And guess what?

24:58.518 --> 25:00.797
It's a hotbed of competition!

25:00.798 --> 25:03.676
We had loads of entries

25:03.678 --> 25:10.276
for our as-of-today brand-new
horticultural categories -

25:10.278 --> 25:13.516
Best Hanging Basket, Best Window Box

25:13.518 --> 25:17.276
and Best Horticultural Use
Of A Flat Balcony.

25:17.278 --> 25:23.196
And me and him is going to build
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon

25:23.198 --> 25:25.356
to show it all off!

25:25.358 --> 25:27.516
Well, I am impressed!

25:27.518 --> 25:29.396
Very impressed.

25:29.398 --> 25:30.957
Well done, you two.

25:30.958 --> 25:32.518
Thanks, Mum.

25:42.038 --> 25:44.455
A hot water bottle in August?

25:47.878 --> 25:49.478
What's wrong?

25:51.398 --> 25:53.117
Sister, I know it's
the Great Silence

25:53.118 --> 25:56.156
and you're not supposed to speak,

25:56.158 --> 25:58.408
but you're clearly in pain.

26:01.678 --> 26:03.517
Please will you tell me what it is?

26:03.518 --> 26:06.076
I can't.

26:06.078 --> 26:08.356
You're a man.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.156
I'm a doctor.

26:11.158 --> 26:13.158
Is it period pain?

26:15.198 --> 26:18.076
I feel... really stupid.

26:18.078 --> 26:21.277
Other women have to go through
the same thing every month.

26:21.278 --> 26:23.757
Sister Frances, you're a midwife.

26:23.758 --> 26:26.677
You know dysmenorrhoea
isn't the same for everyone.

26:26.678 --> 26:29.077
It can be absolutely debilitating.

26:29.078 --> 26:32.517
I'm scared I'm going to make a
mistake that affects a patient.

26:32.518 --> 26:35.477
I know you've taken aspirin.
Have you tried anything else?

26:35.478 --> 26:38.478
Paracetamol. That didn't
work either.

26:50.678 --> 26:52.796
What's that?

26:52.798 --> 26:55.718
Pethidine. A very, very small dose.

26:57.638 --> 27:00.436
I think you should take one.

27:00.438 --> 27:03.022
Just to get you over the worst.

27:10.798 --> 27:13.477
Midwife calling!

27:13.478 --> 27:16.517
Mrs Bryant, what are you doing
out of bed?

27:16.518 --> 27:18.037
He ain't right, Nurse.

27:18.038 --> 27:19.916
Something ain't right.

27:19.918 --> 27:24.077
He ain't hardly feeding.
And today he seems... floppy.

27:24.078 --> 27:26.356
He ain't right, Nurse.

27:26.358 --> 27:27.998
Can I take him?

27:30.678 --> 27:33.398
Come on, Warren, precious.

27:59.598 --> 28:01.596
Maureen...

28:01.598 --> 28:04.797
...why don't you go back to bed
and take Warren with you?

28:04.798 --> 28:09.215
I'm going to ask Dr Turner
to come and check him over.

28:12.238 --> 28:15.956
- See, that ain't
- normal, is it?

28:15.958 --> 28:20.792
It's all right, Maureen. Doctor will
find out what's wrong.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.637
We'll need an ambulance
with an incubator.

28:28.638 --> 28:29.876
Yes, Doctor.

28:29.878 --> 28:31.877
What was that? What is it?

28:31.878 --> 28:34.677
Mrs Bryant, I don't want to
alarm you,

28:34.678 --> 28:37.317
but I would like Warren to be
admitted to hospital

28:37.318 --> 28:40.477
- for examination.
- Why? What's wrong?

28:40.478 --> 28:43.677
I'd like them to look at a couple
of things.

28:43.678 --> 28:46.077
There's a cloudiness in his eyes,

28:46.078 --> 28:48.677
which could mean that his vision
is less than perfect.

28:48.678 --> 28:50.236
Oh, no.

28:50.238 --> 28:53.358
Do you see this blueish colour here?

28:54.878 --> 28:57.836
And on his fingertips and his toes?

28:57.838 --> 29:01.917
I'm afraid it may signify some sort
of problem with Warren's heart.

29:01.918 --> 29:03.756
Oh, my God!

29:03.758 --> 29:05.637
Now, Mrs Bryant,

29:05.638 --> 29:08.637
we are going to get him into
hospital as quickly as possible.

29:08.638 --> 29:09.794
Mm...

29:09.796 --> 29:13.077
They have experts
in paediatric medicine.

29:13.078 --> 29:16.412
Warren is going to be in very
good hands.

29:36.798 --> 29:38.878
Esther!

29:49.958 --> 29:51.598
Mo!

29:52.598 --> 29:55.997
Have they told you anything?
Can we see him?

29:55.998 --> 29:58.716
They won't let us in.

29:58.718 --> 30:02.316
Charlie, they think it's his heart.

30:13.758 --> 30:17.956
No, nothing. Three completely
healthy pregnancies.

30:17.958 --> 30:19.717
Has something happened?

30:19.718 --> 30:22.677
Baby Warren Bryant has been admitted
to St Cuthbert's

30:22.678 --> 30:26.557
with a suspected heart defect
and possible further complications.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.716
What?

30:28.718 --> 30:31.516
But he-he seemed...

30:31.518 --> 30:32.996
I...

30:32.998 --> 30:35.117
We checked his heart. It was normal.

30:35.118 --> 30:37.876
I know. Yesterday too.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.597
We can't find any clues
in Maureen's notes,

30:40.598 --> 30:42.677
and Kevin checked at the surgery,

30:42.678 --> 30:45.197
and she's hardly been to the doctor
all year.

30:45.198 --> 30:47.876
Well, I saw her there.

30:47.878 --> 30:49.597
We'd had that ding-dong, remember?

30:49.598 --> 30:52.797
And it was when I saw her at
the surgery that we made amends.

30:52.798 --> 30:56.956
But I think it was the kids poorly,
not her.

30:56.958 --> 30:58.716
Yes, that's right.

30:58.718 --> 31:03.957
She was worried that they'd got
diphtheria, but it turned out...

31:03.958 --> 31:07.716
It turned out to be German measles.

31:07.718 --> 31:09.358
Rubella?

31:18.038 --> 31:22.277
56,000 people! How on Earth
are they going to hear at the back?

31:22.278 --> 31:25.477
What must it be like to have 56,000
women screaming at you?

31:25.478 --> 31:27.757
A bad day at a Tuesday clinic,
I should imagine.

31:27.758 --> 31:30.196
Good morning, Doctor.

31:30.198 --> 31:32.276
Morning.

31:32.278 --> 31:35.077
I've had some bad news from
St Cuthbert's, I'm afraid.

31:35.078 --> 31:36.131
Warren?

31:36.133 --> 31:40.597
The specialist has found
significant congenital deformities.

31:40.598 --> 31:43.637
The left side of his heart
hasn't developed properly.

31:43.638 --> 31:46.077
But his heart sounded normal
when we examined him.

31:46.078 --> 31:47.676
It would have.

31:47.678 --> 31:51.317
It's only after a couple of days,
when the ductus arteriosus closes,

31:51.318 --> 31:55.397
that the heart fails. Neither of you
missed anything at all.

31:55.398 --> 31:57.716
Poor little boy.

31:57.718 --> 32:00.196
I'm afraid he's also blind,

32:00.198 --> 32:03.237
and there is a high likelihood
of brain damage.

32:03.238 --> 32:06.317
All of this would be consistent with
a diagnosis

32:06.318 --> 32:08.517
of congenital rubella syndrome.

32:08.518 --> 32:11.797
Mother was exposed to rubella
in the first trimester.

32:11.798 --> 32:14.436
Poor Mo.

32:14.438 --> 32:17.116
What's the prognosis, Doctor?

32:17.118 --> 32:19.196
Not good.

32:19.198 --> 32:23.615
Little Warren will live
for a matter of weeks at most.

32:24.678 --> 32:27.237
I'm on my way to see the family now

32:27.238 --> 32:30.077
and I wondered if I could take
Nurse Anderson with me.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.918
Nurse Anderson?

32:33.278 --> 32:34.838
Thank you.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.038
Oh...

32:55.118 --> 32:57.202
We want him home, Doctor.

32:58.198 --> 33:00.956
If they can't make him better...

33:00.958 --> 33:03.116
...what's he doing there?

33:03.118 --> 33:04.876
What's the point?

33:04.878 --> 33:09.236
If he's here, with his family,
where he's loved...

33:09.238 --> 33:12.838
...it might make a difference.

33:15.198 --> 33:18.916
Maybe there's a chance
he'll be all right.

33:18.918 --> 33:22.418
You do hear them stories
sometimes, Doctor.

33:22.798 --> 33:25.436
Mr and Mrs Bryant,

33:25.438 --> 33:29.397
I'm sure that so long as we're
careful about contagion,

33:29.398 --> 33:34.065
I can arrange for Warren
to be discharged into your care.

33:34.478 --> 33:36.837
We'd be more than willing to
support you,

33:36.838 --> 33:38.957
and I don't doubt for a moment

33:38.958 --> 33:43.542
that Warren's quality of life
will be the better for it.

33:44.358 --> 33:47.192
But it won't change the prognosis.

33:48.238 --> 33:50.157
I'm afraid he isn't going to
get better.

33:50.158 --> 33:52.756
You don't know that!

33:52.758 --> 33:55.258
I'm so very sorry, Mrs Bryant.

33:56.318 --> 33:57.838
I'm afraid I do.

33:59.118 --> 34:03.076
I didn't even know I had
German measles!

34:03.078 --> 34:05.676
I wasn't poorly like the kids!

34:05.678 --> 34:07.197
Symptoms can be very mild.

34:07.198 --> 34:08.717
Not for Warren!

34:10.918 --> 34:12.356
No.

34:12.358 --> 34:14.397
You know what I was
thinking yesterday?

34:14.398 --> 34:16.755
That it was the castor oil.

34:16.757 --> 34:19.877
That it was my fault because I made
such a fuss about his birthday.

34:19.878 --> 34:21.275
Love...

34:21.277 --> 34:24.877
Maureen, precious, none of this was
anybody's fault.

34:24.878 --> 34:27.277
When can we get him
home, Doctor?

34:27.277 --> 34:31.695
If our boy ain't got long,
this is where he should be.

34:32.038 --> 34:36.437
He's got the best mum in the world
waiting to look after him.

34:36.438 --> 34:38.355
I'll call the hospital.

34:42.358 --> 34:44.837
- What's she doing?
- Can you see?

34:44.838 --> 34:47.676
I really don't know.

34:47.678 --> 34:50.197
You know, sometimes she replants

34:50.197 --> 34:52.956
the weeds that I dig out
of the vegetable patch.

34:52.958 --> 34:56.117
The club will have my guts for
garters if our exhibition garden

34:56.118 --> 34:59.237
is full of dandelions and nettles.

34:59.238 --> 35:02.077
Can I help you there with
anything, Sister?

35:02.078 --> 35:06.245
No, thank you, Mr Buckle.
I have everything I need.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.478
He's so lovely, ain't he?

35:37.838 --> 35:39.278
Yeah.

35:40.758 --> 35:42.925
I'm scared to go to sleep.

35:43.718 --> 35:45.198
Me too.

35:47.678 --> 35:51.037
I keep on thinking about
all the plans we had.

35:51.038 --> 35:53.872
All the things he's going to miss.

35:57.118 --> 35:58.478
I know, love.

35:59.798 --> 36:01.038
I know.

36:04.558 --> 36:07.636
But...

36:07.638 --> 36:10.236
...this is his life...

36:10.238 --> 36:14.156
...here, right now. And...

36:14.158 --> 36:17.158
...we've got to make the most of it.

36:27.918 --> 36:30.677
Someone appears to have been taking
midwifery supplies

36:30.678 --> 36:32.677
without signing for them.

36:32.678 --> 36:34.037
Well, it certainly wasn't me!

36:34.038 --> 36:35.476
Or me.

36:35.478 --> 36:37.676
Hm. I have my suspicions.

36:37.678 --> 36:40.637
Eight soft yarn blankets,
freshly laundered.

36:40.638 --> 36:42.757
And don't bother denying it, Sister,

36:42.758 --> 36:45.837
because I can see them sticking out
from under your pillows.

36:45.838 --> 36:47.356
What of it?

36:47.358 --> 36:50.597
They are the property
of the Health Authority!

36:50.598 --> 36:52.236
But I require them.

36:52.238 --> 36:53.996
Whatever for?

36:53.998 --> 36:58.157
They are necessary in the
celebration of St Raymond Nonnatus,

36:58.158 --> 37:02.276
whose devotion to expectant
mothers and midwives

37:02.278 --> 37:05.157
far exceeds that of
the Health Authority -

37:05.158 --> 37:07.878
by seven centuries!

37:09.278 --> 37:11.518
Oh, for goodness' sake!

37:12.918 --> 37:15.668
Just don't get any holes in them!

37:27.438 --> 37:30.756
Shall we go and say hello?

37:30.758 --> 37:32.676
Look, May.

37:32.678 --> 37:35.836
Do you see who this is?

37:35.838 --> 37:36.996
May.

37:45.158 --> 37:47.117
Oh, it's all right, May.

37:47.118 --> 37:49.557
She's just a little shy today.

37:49.558 --> 37:52.438
May...

37:55.878 --> 37:57.676
It's all right, May.

37:57.678 --> 38:02.928
Sweetheart, it's all right. There's
nothing to be frightened of.

38:03.398 --> 38:06.517
I'm sorry. This is too much for
her today.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.638
We have to go.

38:12.038 --> 38:13.558
May!

38:15.558 --> 38:17.356
I'm sorry, Miss Tang.

38:17.358 --> 38:19.942
You turned my child against me!

38:21.718 --> 38:24.756
He doesn't manage to eat much.

38:24.758 --> 38:26.557
I wish I could help him.

38:26.558 --> 38:29.556
Maybe he could comfort-suck.

38:29.558 --> 38:30.678
Like this.

38:39.918 --> 38:43.357
It doesn't give him any food, of
course, but...

38:43.358 --> 38:45.775
...I think it's nice for him.

38:55.438 --> 38:58.855
Come and see what Warren's doing,
you two!

38:59.438 --> 39:00.956
Come on, Maxine.

39:00.958 --> 39:04.116
Aww, Max. It's all right.

39:04.118 --> 39:06.836
Look, I feel sad too sometimes.

39:06.838 --> 39:08.836
But look...

39:08.838 --> 39:11.037
...this is making Warren happy.

39:11.038 --> 39:14.276
So, I think we should be happy too.

39:14.278 --> 39:18.677
We've got to show him how much fun
it is to be a Bryant, eh?

39:18.678 --> 39:21.437
I hid the water pistols
under the kitchen sink.

39:21.438 --> 39:23.717
Why don't you give your sister
a good soaking?

39:23.718 --> 39:26.716
Yeah!

39:26.718 --> 39:28.996
That's better.

39:28.998 --> 39:31.476
Ain't it?

39:39.118 --> 39:41.197
What's going on? Shut up!

39:41.198 --> 39:45.032
- Just backing out.
- You're blocking the road.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.438
Is she sleeping?

39:50.558 --> 39:53.277
I don't want to do this
again, Shelagh.

39:53.278 --> 39:55.237
We can't put her though it.

39:55.238 --> 39:57.636
No. I know.

39:57.638 --> 40:01.397
I'm very sorry for Esther, and her
past, but we can't change it.

40:01.398 --> 40:04.798
Our priority has to be May.

40:05.878 --> 40:08.478
You're right.

40:10.878 --> 40:15.117
Nurse Phyllis, why are you walking?
Where's your car?

40:15.118 --> 40:18.202
It was in need
of emergency attention.

40:20.478 --> 40:23.157
I've gone over it twice,
Nurse Crane,

40:23.158 --> 40:25.637
and I can't find any reason for
the noise you're describing,

40:25.638 --> 40:28.437
the one you call the clickety
ticking sort of sound.

40:28.438 --> 40:30.236
How very perplexing.

40:30.238 --> 40:32.397
Nevertheless, thank you
for your prompt attention.

40:32.398 --> 40:34.237
Might I furnish you with some tea?

40:34.238 --> 40:36.317
Ah, Sister Monica Joan brought
me some.

40:36.318 --> 40:38.276
It's gone cold.

40:40.798 --> 40:44.557
There was never any clickety ticking
sort of sound, was there?

40:44.558 --> 40:46.757
I had to go along with
what Nurse Crane said,

40:46.758 --> 40:49.517
especially if it gave me
a chance of bumping into you.

40:49.518 --> 40:52.037
Cyril, you can bump into me
whenever you like!

40:52.038 --> 40:54.997
Whenever you've got the time.
But... you don't have time.

40:54.998 --> 40:58.117
No. Because I'm always working.
Like you're always working.

40:58.118 --> 41:00.117
We've both got jobs to do, Lucille.

41:00.118 --> 41:02.197
Is that the only reason
why you're here?

41:02.198 --> 41:04.717
Because you've got a job to do?

41:04.718 --> 41:07.077
Lucille, I'm trying to make a life,

41:07.078 --> 41:09.437
a whole life, from almost nothing.

41:09.438 --> 41:11.156
I work, and I study.

41:11.158 --> 41:13.157
I save money, and I pray.

41:13.158 --> 41:15.317
And I pay for all of that whilst
having to wait

41:15.318 --> 41:17.757
- for the things I want.
- Meaning what?

41:17.758 --> 41:20.156
- Meaning you.
- Me?

41:20.158 --> 41:22.477
Well, there's no point in
you waiting

41:22.478 --> 41:24.757
if I'm not going to wait for you.

41:24.758 --> 41:26.316
Tea for two!

41:26.318 --> 41:29.197
And I found some shortbread fingers
going begging.

41:29.198 --> 41:33.865
You should have saved yourself
the trouble. Cyril's busy!

41:41.598 --> 41:43.316
Oh...

41:43.318 --> 41:46.117
He's a handsome chap, isn't he,
Dr McNulty?

41:46.118 --> 41:47.836
He certainly is.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.716
Excuse me, Doctor.

41:50.718 --> 41:54.597
I'd better go, little man. Them
windows won't clean themselves.

41:54.598 --> 41:56.837
It must be hard to tear
yourself away.

41:56.838 --> 41:58.636
Well, you don't know.

41:58.638 --> 42:02.277
You don't know how things'll be
when you come back.

42:02.278 --> 42:04.837
Do you know, Doctor? Can you tell?

42:04.838 --> 42:06.876
I can tell...

42:06.878 --> 42:09.836
...that he is very well cared for.

42:09.838 --> 42:13.476
I can tell that he's stable
for the moment.

42:13.478 --> 42:16.197
I wouldn't expect that to
change immediately,

42:16.198 --> 42:19.397
but I'm afraid I can't give you
any guarantees.

42:19.398 --> 42:23.556
Now, you know you can call on me
at any time?

42:23.558 --> 42:25.478
Thank you.

42:29.078 --> 42:31.358
Thank you.

42:32.398 --> 42:34.397
I think we should do it.

42:34.398 --> 42:36.036
So do I.

42:37.878 --> 42:40.877
We want to hold a gathering for him.

42:40.878 --> 42:42.436
Just small.

42:42.438 --> 42:45.716
The other two kids always
have parties.

42:45.718 --> 42:48.078
That's a lovely idea.

42:49.398 --> 42:51.876
Well done.

42:51.878 --> 42:54.637
You learn to keep that sigh in
over time.

42:54.638 --> 42:56.516
Does it get easier?

42:56.518 --> 42:58.516
It gets easier to hide.

42:58.518 --> 42:59.876
Usually.

42:59.878 --> 43:02.917
But not if somebody's going
to lose a child.

43:02.918 --> 43:04.078
No.

43:06.838 --> 43:08.877
Sorry to arrive unannounced.

43:08.878 --> 43:12.516
Is there somewhere
we can talk privately?

43:12.518 --> 43:16.117
Girls, why don't you give
the sunflowers some water?

43:16.118 --> 43:18.916
Yay!

43:18.918 --> 43:20.598
Just tell me.

43:22.598 --> 43:25.197
Esther has refused
to sign the consent papers.

43:25.198 --> 43:28.448
She wants to take May back to
Hong Kong.

43:28.918 --> 43:33.837
Has Esther given you any indication
as to how she could support May?

43:33.838 --> 43:38.397
None. But she is absolutely
determined to take her back.

43:38.398 --> 43:40.917
And she won't meet us or discuss it.

43:40.918 --> 43:44.236
We know that Esther is May's mother.

43:44.238 --> 43:50.156
And if we thought she was truly in a
position to care for her...

43:50.158 --> 43:53.316
...it would... break our hearts,

43:53.318 --> 43:55.518
but we would accept it.

43:56.758 --> 43:58.756
But this?

43:58.758 --> 44:02.357
When I think of what May could face,
I feel sick.

44:02.358 --> 44:03.796
Physically sick.

44:03.798 --> 44:05.836
My dear Shelagh...

44:05.838 --> 44:08.917
Sister, you said before that you
wished you could help.

44:08.918 --> 44:11.357
But she trusted the Order
once before.

44:11.358 --> 44:13.525
Perhaps she'd talk to you.

44:15.478 --> 44:17.517
Last one!

44:17.518 --> 44:20.685
- Everyone together!
- Come on in, Mum.

44:24.918 --> 44:27.236
Lovely.

44:27.238 --> 44:28.518
Come on.

44:30.118 --> 44:32.196
Oh... Hello, Nurse.

44:32.198 --> 44:34.356
How much was the film?

44:34.358 --> 44:37.358
I'll give you some... coins.

44:44.838 --> 44:47.756
Thanks.

44:47.758 --> 44:49.878
Right...

45:01.558 --> 45:03.877
Thank you for meeting me, Miss Tang.

45:03.878 --> 45:06.676
I won't change my mind.

45:06.678 --> 45:08.438
Very well.

45:14.758 --> 45:17.157
They made my child afraid of me.

45:17.158 --> 45:19.717
Miss Tang, that's not the case.

45:19.718 --> 45:22.237
May is frightened
because she's confused.

45:22.238 --> 45:24.917
Again and again she's been wrenched
from everything she knows.

45:24.918 --> 45:27.477
Always completely without
her control.

45:27.478 --> 45:30.078
And now she faces it once more.

45:31.518 --> 45:34.637
- A child should be with her mother.
- I agree...

45:34.638 --> 45:39.516
...if the mother is able to care for
her, keep her safe.

45:39.518 --> 45:42.317
I have a job looking after
English children.

45:42.318 --> 45:45.877
They love me. They run to me before
they go to their own parents.

45:45.878 --> 45:47.717
I know how to keep a child safe.

45:47.718 --> 45:51.316
I do not doubt it for one moment,
Miss Tang.

45:51.318 --> 45:53.797
But what will happen to that job

45:53.798 --> 45:56.877
once your employers know that you
have a child of your own?

45:56.878 --> 45:59.356
There will be no job.

45:59.358 --> 46:01.836
And what will you do then?

46:01.838 --> 46:05.077
You think she's better off here
with your friends,

46:05.078 --> 46:07.437
forgetting about her mother,
her language,

46:07.438 --> 46:10.436
forgetting that she's Chinese.

46:10.438 --> 46:12.557
But other people won't forget.

46:12.558 --> 46:15.517
She will grow older and other people
will look at her.

46:15.518 --> 46:17.517
And then they will treat her
the same way

46:17.518 --> 46:19.717
like how your people always
treated mine!

46:19.718 --> 46:25.476
Miss Tang... Esther, there is no
ideal situation here.

46:25.478 --> 46:29.997
But the worst, the very worst, is if
May ends up back in an orphanage.

46:29.998 --> 46:32.832
Can you be sure that won't happen?

46:39.238 --> 46:41.636
If I sign the paper,

46:41.638 --> 46:44.238
how can she know I love her?!

46:47.678 --> 46:52.078
How can I sign the paper
to give my child away?!

46:55.358 --> 46:58.557
Ruby and George tried to put up
their den. It was windy...

46:58.558 --> 47:00.436
Out for the count, eh?

47:00.438 --> 47:02.436
Yeah.

47:02.438 --> 47:04.637
- Right. Come on.
- No, leave him.

47:04.638 --> 47:06.276
It's nice.

47:06.278 --> 47:07.997
Yeah, but there's hardly any room!

47:07.998 --> 47:11.516
Come on. It's nice to be
all together.

47:11.518 --> 47:13.558
All right, come on.

47:29.558 --> 47:31.558
Night-night, little one.

47:54.838 --> 47:56.877
It was a lovely day, wasn't it?

47:56.878 --> 47:58.518
Yeah.

49:46.198 --> 49:48.517
Perhaps Phyllis can set
the Cubs on Cyril

49:48.518 --> 49:50.277
with their sizzling sticks.

49:50.278 --> 49:51.917
I don't want to talk about it.

49:51.918 --> 49:54.278
Fair enough, lass.

49:56.078 --> 49:59.797
What do we think? This'll be all
right for country dancing, won't it?

49:59.798 --> 50:02.118
- Definitely.
- Jolly good.

50:15.038 --> 50:17.796
Good morning, Sister.

50:17.798 --> 50:19.437
Are you feeling better?

50:19.438 --> 50:21.838
Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.

50:25.478 --> 50:28.316
I know you give May a good home.

50:28.318 --> 50:30.156
I know you love her.

50:30.158 --> 50:32.836
And I expect she love you too.

50:32.838 --> 50:35.476
But if I cannot take her...

50:35.478 --> 50:40.196
...I am content for you
to be her... foster parents.

50:40.198 --> 50:42.037
But I will not sign the paper.

50:42.038 --> 50:43.276
Miss Tang...

50:43.278 --> 50:45.317
- She should not be brought here!
- Miss Tang.

50:45.318 --> 50:48.477
Dr and Mrs Turner could pursue May's
adoption through the court

50:48.478 --> 50:50.677
in this country, and the decision

50:50.678 --> 50:52.837
would most likely go in
their favour.

50:52.838 --> 50:54.836
I know.

50:54.838 --> 50:57.798
But I'm asking you not to do this!

51:00.318 --> 51:02.558
May needs security.

51:04.118 --> 51:08.197
And she needs a legal next of kin
in this country.

51:08.198 --> 51:10.117
What if she had an accident?

51:10.118 --> 51:12.557
We might not be allowed to see her

51:12.558 --> 51:15.317
or make decisions about
her treatment.

51:15.318 --> 51:18.077
This is true.
The Hong Kong Adoption Project

51:18.078 --> 51:21.245
cannot be a child's guardian
long term.

51:25.158 --> 51:28.518
Then be her guardian in
this country.

51:29.758 --> 51:31.678
But not her parents.

51:37.398 --> 51:40.197
I've got a bit of a
free evening tonight.

51:40.198 --> 51:42.557
I can help you with anything for
the show, if you like.

51:42.558 --> 51:45.876
No, no, you're all right, love.

51:45.878 --> 51:48.436
I do believe...

51:48.438 --> 51:50.478
...we're ready.

52:01.758 --> 52:06.797
Well, these have survived rather
better than I thought they might.

52:06.798 --> 52:09.916
We've all survived.

52:09.918 --> 52:11.556
More or less.

52:11.558 --> 52:15.676
We have. We're here, May's here.

52:15.678 --> 52:19.038
All our children are here,
and blooming.

52:20.198 --> 52:22.916
Not everyone can say that.

52:22.918 --> 52:25.557
And even if it can't be this way
for ever,

52:25.558 --> 52:28.397
we have to make the most of it now.

52:28.398 --> 52:31.598
We do. And we will.

52:33.038 --> 52:36.476
We can do anything together,
can't we?

52:36.478 --> 52:38.636
Mummy! Daddy!

52:38.638 --> 52:40.197
Watch the sunflowers!

52:40.198 --> 52:43.032
Come on. Let's go and wake up Tim!

52:58.118 --> 53:01.278
Trifle, anyone?

53:07.198 --> 53:10.277
Anybody who wants to put anything
else in the van, come now.

53:10.278 --> 53:12.038
Last chance.

53:14.958 --> 53:17.756
Mr Bryant!

53:17.758 --> 53:19.918
Hello.

53:22.798 --> 53:24.916
We got the pictures back.

53:24.918 --> 53:27.078
They're really good.

53:28.158 --> 53:29.518
Anyway...

53:32.038 --> 53:34.118
...this one's for you.

53:36.518 --> 53:37.998
Oh...

53:41.038 --> 53:43.236
Thank you so much.

53:43.238 --> 53:44.798
Thanks.

54:02.038 --> 54:03.558
Oh...

54:06.158 --> 54:09.117
- I am so sorry, Lucille.
- I overreacted.

54:09.118 --> 54:11.837
No, you didn't. You were
clearly upset.

54:11.838 --> 54:15.677
I should have been here supporting
you, and not working on another car.

54:15.678 --> 54:18.357
I'm proud of you
for helping our community.

54:18.358 --> 54:21.025
There are more important things.

54:26.918 --> 54:29.476
Anyway...

54:29.478 --> 54:31.796
You are coming to the show?

54:31.798 --> 54:34.215
Wild horses wouldn't stop me.

54:55.678 --> 54:58.876
Ah!

54:58.878 --> 55:02.317
♪ The grand old Duke of York
He had 10,000 men

55:02.318 --> 55:04.757
♪ He marched them up
to the top of the hill

55:04.758 --> 55:07.758
♪ And he marched them
down again... ♪

55:12.238 --> 55:14.917
You did it, love! It's all
beautiful!

55:14.918 --> 55:16.956
Oh...

55:16.958 --> 55:19.198
Thanks, love.

55:21.798 --> 55:24.558
Well... almost all.

55:25.758 --> 55:31.342
Perhaps our Sister intended it as a
place of peaceful contemplation.

55:32.878 --> 55:36.677
Sister Monica Joan, I have offered
to help on numerous occasions.

55:36.678 --> 55:38.277
This is supposed to be a garden!

55:38.278 --> 55:40.118
Where are the flowers?

55:42.118 --> 55:44.716
The flowers of St Raymond

55:44.718 --> 55:48.158
are the most beautiful flowers
of the day!

56:09.998 --> 56:13.797
Flowers take many forms.

56:13.798 --> 56:16.036
Each one has its story,

56:16.038 --> 56:18.118
and its roots.

56:19.078 --> 56:21.516
Each one unfurls

56:21.518 --> 56:23.837
from its bulb or its kernel,

56:23.838 --> 56:28.996
revealing itself and all its promise
as it will.

56:28.998 --> 56:33.158
Each is entirely precious
and unique.

56:46.798 --> 56:50.636
Each is the best, and the only.

56:50.638 --> 56:53.236
Each will linger in the mind.

56:53.238 --> 56:57.678
Each will teach us what it is
to love.

56:58.758 --> 57:02.116
To be torn, to nurture,

57:02.118 --> 57:03.956
and let go.

57:13.878 --> 57:17.956
Not every garden blooms as
we expected.

57:17.958 --> 57:22.718
Despite our care,
not every child can thrive.

57:25.238 --> 57:27.876
Tears take the place of rain

57:27.878 --> 57:30.518
and the sunshine fails us.

57:32.678 --> 57:36.638
But the buds, however delicate,
were perfect.

57:38.598 --> 57:40.916
They were real,

57:40.918 --> 57:45.335
and their fleeting scent
will live forever on the air.

58:07.958 --> 58:10.157
Have you ever looked after
someone like me, Nurse?

58:10.158 --> 58:11.317
Do you mean blind?

58:11.318 --> 58:13.197
A baby needs proper care, Marion.

58:13.198 --> 58:14.796
I'm its mother.

58:14.798 --> 58:17.957
- You're not going to send me home, are you?
- Yvonne! Where's my wife?

58:17.958 --> 58:20.877
- Get that baby up for adoption,
for its own safety. - No!

58:20.878 --> 58:23.517
It's my gran. I'm so worried about
her, Lucille.

58:23.518 --> 58:25.957
- The welfare of the
- baby is paramount.

58:25.958 --> 58:29.292
If we have any doubt, we must
express it.
