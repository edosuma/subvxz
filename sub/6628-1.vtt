02:11.292 --> 02:13.007
That old lady
is crazy.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.007
You can say
that again.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.731
Good morning, all.

02:20.935 --> 02:22.197
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:22.403 --> 02:25.236
We reviewed our cases
over the weekend?

02:25.439 --> 02:26.428
Yes.

02:26.640 --> 02:28.665
You're watching
that Mabel Simmons case.

02:28.876 --> 02:31.709
- It's all over the news.
- Right.

02:32.046 --> 02:37.541
Now, that old woman has been giving
the police the blues all of her life.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.947
- She was an ugly baby.
- Okay.

02:42.556 --> 02:44.922
- Petty theft at 9.
- Oh, my goodness.

02:45.292 --> 02:47.385
Illegal gambling at 18.

02:47.594 --> 02:48.788
That Afro is thirsty.

02:48.996 --> 02:50.429
Check fraud.

02:50.631 --> 02:52.030
Not bad. Not bad.

02:52.232 --> 02:54.564
- Identify theft.
- Lord, help her.

02:54.768 --> 02:55.962
Insurance fraud.

02:56.337 --> 02:58.271
Okay, everything,
except attempted murder.

02:58.472 --> 03:00.440
- Attempted murder.
- There we go.

03:00.641 --> 03:02.199
Oh, my goodness.

03:02.409 --> 03:04.377
- Assault.
- Nice.

03:04.578 --> 03:09.208
The list goes on and on
and so on and so on.

03:09.416 --> 03:14.115
Unfortunately, our fine officers may
have made a mistake on her takedown.

03:14.321 --> 03:17.347
So we have to handle this with care.

03:17.591 --> 03:18.751
Who wants it?

03:21.862 --> 03:24.626
Don't all volunteer at the same time.

03:24.832 --> 03:26.493
You're supposed to be helping me.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.260
We have no volunteers
for the Simmons case?

03:30.738 --> 03:32.433
Okay.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.970
Linda, it's all yours.

03:36.176 --> 03:38.110
Thank you. Stop laughing.

03:38.312 --> 03:41.179
By the way, let's congratulate
our Linda Davis...

03:41.382 --> 03:43.577
...on her 89 percent conviction rate.

03:43.784 --> 03:45.684
Thank you.

03:46.687 --> 03:49.155
With numbers like that,
you'll be DA one day.

03:49.356 --> 03:51.290
- Okay.
- That's my girl.

03:51.492 --> 03:56.020
Everyone else, let's check the boards
for the new cases and let's get to court.

03:56.230 --> 03:57.720
All right.

04:02.136 --> 04:04.764
- Honey, there goes our appointment.
- I know.

04:04.972 --> 04:06.530
And you're all broken up about it.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.106
- I am. I got a lot of work anyway.
- I know.

04:09.309 --> 04:12.210
That's all right. After this case,
it's just you and me, Tanya.

04:12.413 --> 04:14.506
Good, that will give me time
to talk you out...

04:14.715 --> 04:16.978
...of these taffeta
bridesmaids dresses.

04:17.184 --> 04:19.310
Wha...? You like them,
don't you, baby?

04:19.987 --> 04:22.581
Take my advice,
just nod and say yes.

04:22.790 --> 04:24.815
- Of course.
- You're weak.

04:25.025 --> 04:26.151
Yeah, he's smart.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.021
- You're smart.
- I'm smart.

04:28.228 --> 04:29.820
- Thank you.
- I'll see you later.

04:30.030 --> 04:31.861
- All right.
- Sign that for me. Thank you.

04:32.066 --> 04:34.626
- And you have fun with that.
- Thank you.

04:34.835 --> 04:36.564
So...

04:37.371 --> 04:39.566
- You set a date.
- Yes, I set a date.

04:39.773 --> 04:41.638
You know you're gonna need
a best man.

04:41.842 --> 04:42.968
Told you I got brothers.

04:43.177 --> 04:46.908
But your brothers have not been
the kind of friend that I've been to you.

04:47.114 --> 04:50.811
Chuck, the only reason you wanna be
in my wedding is you wanna be seen.

04:51.018 --> 04:52.280
- That hurts.
- Yes.

04:52.486 --> 04:53.510
That really hurts.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.812
But you are right.

04:55.022 --> 04:57.081
Linda's parents, they're loaded, Josh.

04:57.291 --> 04:59.919
The governor's gonna be there.
The mayor's gonna be there.

05:00.127 --> 05:02.186
- Get out of here.
- Come on. Hook your boy up.

05:02.396 --> 05:04.694
- I need you to be my usher.
- I don't want... Listen.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.763
- That's an important job.
- What can I say?

05:06.967 --> 05:08.832
I just don't know.

05:09.036 --> 05:12.130
I just don't know, Cora.
I just don't know.

05:13.941 --> 05:16.671
Uncle Joe, are you all right?

05:18.412 --> 05:20.107
Uncle Joe?

05:22.116 --> 05:23.515
Breathe, Joe, breathe.

05:27.187 --> 05:29.178
You... You okay?

05:30.824 --> 05:32.553
I'm good, Cora. Turn that oxygen up.

05:32.759 --> 05:36.092
You're not supposed to be smoking
around oxygen. That's the problem.

05:36.296 --> 05:38.662
Oxygen is everywhere in the air.

05:38.866 --> 05:41.357
If you light a cigarette,
you're lighting it in oxygen.

05:41.568 --> 05:43.433
If you ain't got oxygen,
fire won't work.

05:43.637 --> 05:46.538
- Learn some chemistry, honey. Learn.
- Chemistry?

05:46.740 --> 05:50.198
What the hell you talking about?
You don't know what you talking about.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.537
- Oh, you...
- This helps my...

05:52.746 --> 05:55.442
My blood pressure.
Smoke to help my blood pressure.

05:55.649 --> 05:57.879
Fool around and blow you,
your blood pressure up.

05:58.085 --> 05:59.074
That's right.

05:59.286 --> 06:00.719
This here is good for you.

06:00.921 --> 06:02.081
It's good for you.

06:02.289 --> 06:04.257
It came straight down from heaven.

06:04.458 --> 06:08.053
God sent it down... And he sent Viagra.
He sent this and he sent that oxygen.

06:08.262 --> 06:11.493
You put them all together, you'll take
a woman to heaven and back.

06:11.698 --> 06:12.756
Thank you.

06:12.966 --> 06:14.831
How you gonna sit there,
talk about God...

06:15.035 --> 06:17.128
...with a joint in your hand
and some Viagra?

06:17.638 --> 06:19.572
God made this.

06:19.907 --> 06:24.901
He made the birds and the bees
and the flowers and these trees.

06:25.112 --> 06:29.310
Joe, you're just like your sister.
Both of y'all are going to hell.

06:31.552 --> 06:32.678
- What?
- Uncle Joe.

06:32.886 --> 06:34.046
- You want some?
- Joe...

06:34.254 --> 06:36.984
- No. I need you to focus, Uncle Joe.
- Focus on what?

06:37.191 --> 06:40.024
Why were you running from
the police? Madea? What happened?

06:40.227 --> 06:42.252
Mabel always running
from the police, Cora.

06:42.462 --> 06:44.953
You're mama been running
from the police. She's a ho.

06:45.165 --> 06:47.599
Po-po. The po-po come,
she's running like a ho.

06:47.801 --> 06:49.769
Your mama always running
from the police.

06:49.970 --> 06:52.165
I'm sorry to tell you,
your mama is a po-po ho.

06:52.506 --> 06:54.531
That fool is a thug.

06:54.741 --> 06:58.438
That's right. Your mama a gangsta.
King Kong ain't got nothing on her.

06:58.645 --> 07:00.510
- Got nothing on her.
- Daddy.

07:01.949 --> 07:04.417
- Stop talking about mama.
- I'm not talking about her.

07:04.618 --> 07:06.142
- You go on...
- How you all doing?

07:06.353 --> 07:07.843
- Hey, Brian.
- I just saw the news.

07:08.055 --> 07:10.489
What is going on
with you and Madea?

07:11.491 --> 07:14.153
- What's happening? Are you all right?
- I ain't all right.

07:14.361 --> 07:15.919
What's wrong?

07:16.129 --> 07:18.324
I can't feel my big toes.

07:18.532 --> 07:20.124
Thank you.

07:21.501 --> 07:25.870
I'll tell you, when your parents get to be
a certain age, it's like raising children.

07:26.073 --> 07:28.940
My kids don't give me trouble
like you and Madea are giving me.

07:29.142 --> 07:31.167
What is the matter?
Have you lost your mind?

07:31.378 --> 07:34.347
Madea's on probation. I don't know
what she was thinking about.

07:34.548 --> 07:37.039
That never stopped your mom.
I got her out of trouble.

07:37.251 --> 07:38.809
She's going to jail this time.

07:39.019 --> 07:42.284
To the big house, prison, the slammer.
They're gonna lock her up...

07:42.489 --> 07:45.253
...press her down, shake it together,
gonna be in her bosom.

07:45.459 --> 07:47.051
- I'm telling you, she...
- Mr. Brown!

07:48.829 --> 07:49.818
Too much?

07:50.163 --> 07:52.063
- Yes.
- Yes.

07:52.466 --> 07:55.196
Oh, wait, y'all go ahead.
Finish what y'all were saying.

07:57.604 --> 08:00.903
Come on, Cora, let's go to down there,
see if we can get her out there.

08:01.108 --> 08:03.474
They gonna lock her up.
She's going to the slammer.

08:03.677 --> 08:05.167
- To the big jail.
- Mr. Brown.

08:06.046 --> 08:09.573
- We don't need you to go.
- I got to go. They'll put her in Alcatraz.

08:09.783 --> 08:13.549
She's gonna be in solitary condition.
They gonna lock her big behind.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.312
- It's Alcatraz.
- Bye.

08:15.522 --> 08:17.080
Get the hell on out of here.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.225
Better behave yourself while I'm gone.

08:19.626 --> 08:20.957
What the hell I'm gonna do?

08:21.161 --> 08:24.597
I'm so high, you look like
your real daddy right now.

08:33.407 --> 08:36.240
<i>City of Atlanta v. Washington.</i>

08:36.443 --> 08:38.604
Miss, you were arrested
for prostitution.

08:38.812 --> 08:39.972
Yes, Your Honor, she was.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.114
Miss Washington...

08:42.649 --> 08:44.708
...was arrested several times before.

08:47.888 --> 08:49.355
Candy?

08:53.694 --> 08:57.425
- Joshua?
- I'm sorry, Your Honor. I need to...

08:57.798 --> 09:00.164
I need to pass this case
to my colleague.

09:00.367 --> 09:02.301
It seems that I know this defendant.

09:02.502 --> 09:04.993
Then get it to one of your colleagues.

09:07.441 --> 09:10.239
- Hey, what's going on?
- I know her.

09:10.544 --> 09:12.102
How?

09:13.714 --> 09:15.648
It's a long story, but will you take it?

09:15.849 --> 09:17.111
What's the case?

09:17.317 --> 09:19.080
It's simple prostitution.

09:19.286 --> 09:21.447
Then you have to take
my drunk and disorderly.

09:21.655 --> 09:23.350
- Fine.
- Then give me a foot rub later.

09:23.557 --> 09:25.149
- Okay.
- People, today.

09:25.359 --> 09:28.886
Your Honor, Miss Washington has
been arrested twice for prostitution.

09:29.096 --> 09:30.529
The people request no bail.

09:30.731 --> 09:33.359
This woman was simply
walking home from the bus stop...

09:33.567 --> 09:38.630
Save it. Save it. Bail is set
at $ 1500 cash or bond until trial date.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.933
- Fifteen hundred dollars?
- Yes, $ 1500.

09:42.342 --> 09:44.469
Miss Washington,
if you manage to make bail...

09:44.678 --> 09:46.441
...you better be back for your trial.

09:46.646 --> 09:48.204
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

09:48.415 --> 09:50.679
If you're not here, you will regret it.

09:51.017 --> 09:53.611
Go see the clerk for your trial date.

10:01.395 --> 10:02.623
Next case.

10:02.829 --> 10:05.059
<i>City of Atlanta v. Mabel Simmons.</i>

10:05.532 --> 10:07.659
Hey, Cora. Hey, Brown.

10:08.034 --> 10:10.969
If the Lord get me out of this,
I'm going by the church.

10:11.371 --> 10:13.168
- Better mean it.
- I'll go by the church.

10:13.373 --> 10:15.273
- You better mean it.
- I mean it.

10:15.475 --> 10:18.171
Hey, Judge.
Oh, girl, your hair is so pretty.

10:18.378 --> 10:19.367
Who's doing your hair?

10:19.579 --> 10:21.046
Lord, have mercy. How you doing?

10:21.648 --> 10:25.175
Mabel Simmons, you come before me
more than you go to the doctor.

10:25.385 --> 10:28.548
Listen, I've changed my life.
I am living for the Lord.

10:28.755 --> 10:30.518
- Since when?
- I am living for the Lord.

10:30.724 --> 10:32.316
I am living for the Lord.

10:32.526 --> 10:35.689
Hallelujah. I feel him down in my spirit.

10:35.896 --> 10:39.263
You know, as I think
about the goodness of Jesus...

10:39.466 --> 10:42.993
...and all that he has done for me...

10:43.203 --> 10:47.765
...my soul cries out,
"Hallelujah, thank God for saving me."

10:47.974 --> 10:49.703
You finished?

10:50.811 --> 10:54.907
I don't believe that no more than
I believe you will stay out of trouble.

10:55.115 --> 10:57.276
- Your Honor, judge...
- Save it. I saw the video.

10:57.484 --> 11:01.944
And I told you that if she came back
before me again, she was going to jail.

11:02.155 --> 11:03.281
She's going to jail.

11:03.490 --> 11:06.118
You're a lawyer.
You're supposed to be getting me off.

11:06.326 --> 11:08.385
You're weak-ass.
I gotta get me a real lawyer.

11:08.595 --> 11:11.723
Matt Johnson or somebody.
You weak-ass lawyer.

11:12.265 --> 11:14.665
- Good Lord.
- Your Honor, there's something...

11:14.868 --> 11:17.428
...you need to understand.
- There's nothing you can do.

11:17.637 --> 11:21.129
- She is going to jail this time.
- I don't know about that.

11:21.341 --> 11:25.038
- And why not?
- Our officers forgot to Mirandize her.

11:25.245 --> 11:28.112
I was waiting for Miranda to come in
and nobody came in.

11:28.315 --> 11:31.546
That's right. Ain't nobody Miranda me.
Miranda wasn't in the room.

11:31.751 --> 11:33.309
Excuse me?

11:33.520 --> 11:35.249
We were fighting for our lives.

11:35.455 --> 11:36.786
You forgot to Mirandize her?

11:36.990 --> 11:39.424
That old woman got the strength
of any man.

11:42.696 --> 11:44.596
I've got to let you go.

11:44.798 --> 11:46.766
You gotta let me go.

11:47.734 --> 11:50.396
- As much as I hate it, I have to.
- Yes, you do.

11:50.604 --> 11:53.232
But I'm gonna suspend
your driver's license indefinitely.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.566
Gonna suspend my license?

11:54.774 --> 11:57.538
My license been suspended.
Hell, you ain't doing nothing.

11:57.744 --> 12:01.202
I ain't had a license for 38 years.
She's gonna suspend my license.

12:01.414 --> 12:03.712
What's that gonna do? I got keys.

12:03.917 --> 12:06.511
I'm gonna order you
to anger management counseling.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.745
She'll take it. Thank you.
We appreciate it.

12:08.955 --> 12:13.016
Go see the clerk. Get the paperwork
done and get her out of my courtroom.

12:13.226 --> 12:14.921
- You're free.
- Free? Look at my neck.

12:15.128 --> 12:18.757
- Hold on. Did you see my eyes?
- Saw your eyes, saw that face too.

12:18.965 --> 12:21.160
You're tore the hell up. I'm free to go.

12:21.368 --> 12:24.929
I know you wish you was going home,
but I'm going home. I'm going home.

12:25.138 --> 12:28.335
Calm down, officer. It's your fault.
You forgot to Mirandize her.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.567
- This is ridiculous.
- Take care, judge.

12:30.777 --> 12:32.677
I love you, but I got to go.

12:32.879 --> 12:35.006
But the saving grace is...

12:35.215 --> 12:38.981
...she couldn't stay out of trouble
if you paid her. She'll be back.

12:41.588 --> 12:43.488
Hey, Joshua.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.457
Hey.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.687
Hey, Ellen.

12:48.328 --> 12:50.387
- Who's this?
- This is Mindy.

12:50.597 --> 12:52.064
Mindy.

12:52.265 --> 12:54.233
Wait in the car, baby.

12:58.204 --> 13:00.331
She's only 14, Josh.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.236
Pimp found her in the bus station,
put her in the streets.

13:03.643 --> 13:06.578
- Well, I'm glad you found her.
- Thank God.

13:06.780 --> 13:07.804
Ellen, I...

13:08.014 --> 13:12.610
I gotta tell you, I think the job
that you're doing with these girls...

13:12.953 --> 13:14.386
...is great.

13:14.588 --> 13:17.989
- Just trying to do the work of my Lord.
- Well, I know you make him proud.

13:18.191 --> 13:21.024
- Well, thanks again.
- All right.

13:21.728 --> 13:22.990
Hey, Ellen. Wait.

13:23.196 --> 13:26.188
I want you to meet somebody. Candy.

13:26.399 --> 13:28.890
This is Ellen Holmes.
She's a minister and she...

13:29.135 --> 13:31.729
- She helps get girls off the street.
- Hi.

13:32.305 --> 13:33.863
Hey.

13:34.374 --> 13:36.239
Here is my card if you need anything.

13:36.443 --> 13:38.707
Do I look like I'm on the streets to you?

13:38.912 --> 13:41.039
No, but you look like
you work in the streets.

13:41.247 --> 13:43.943
You know what, I ain't got no time
for no Jesus jokers.

13:44.684 --> 13:47.517
Fine. Then I ain't got time
for you either, sucker.

13:48.555 --> 13:50.614
See you later, Joshua.

13:53.627 --> 13:54.992
What kind of minister is that?

13:55.195 --> 13:58.426
I know, I know.
She's the real deal though.

13:58.632 --> 14:00.395
So you bailed me out?

14:00.867 --> 14:01.993
Yeah.

14:02.202 --> 14:05.330
Where you wanna do this?
We can go to your car, to your house.

14:05.538 --> 14:07.870
- I'm not tripping.
- What are you talking about?

14:08.074 --> 14:09.837
You bailed me out.
You want something.

14:10.043 --> 14:13.570
- Do you think I want sex from you?
- Well, what you want then?

14:13.780 --> 14:16.578
What about, you know, how you been?
How are you doing?

14:16.783 --> 14:19.911
No man asking a woman how she
doing unless you want something

14:20.120 --> 14:22.281
So, what is it?
What do you want from me, Josh?

14:22.489 --> 14:25.117
Okay. What are you doing
out here on these streets, Candy?

14:25.325 --> 14:28.522
How about you don't worry about that?
I gotta go. I ain't got time...

14:28.728 --> 14:31.060
Candy, hold on. Hold on. Just...

14:31.264 --> 14:33.698
All right. Let me take you
to get something to eat.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.060
You hungry?

14:36.436 --> 14:37.903
Come on.

14:38.772 --> 14:40.262
Please?

14:43.309 --> 14:44.970
- The Lord is so good.
- Yes, he is.

14:45.178 --> 14:48.306
He is so good, he delivered
your mama out of the belly of that jail.

14:48.515 --> 14:49.573
- Yes, he did.
- Yes.

14:49.783 --> 14:52.217
We're going to Church
Sunday, huh, Madea?

14:53.119 --> 14:54.347
I ain't going to no church.

14:54.554 --> 14:56.818
Now, hold up. Wait a minute.

14:57.023 --> 14:58.752
Let me put some church in it.

14:58.958 --> 15:00.926
You said
if the Lord got you through this...

15:01.127 --> 15:02.719
...you was going by the church.

15:02.929 --> 15:05.523
That's just what I'm gonna do.
I'm going by the church.

15:05.732 --> 15:08.223
- So when you coming?
- We just did.

15:08.435 --> 15:10.960
I said I would go by the church.
We just passed by one.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.604
Hallelujah. Saint Philip.

15:12.806 --> 15:14.740
Hail Mary full of grace
and all you people.

15:14.941 --> 15:16.966
God bless you.
All you people. Hello.

15:17.210 --> 15:20.304
Oh, Mabel, the Lord is just so mad...

15:20.513 --> 15:23.744
You just make the Lord mad.

15:23.950 --> 15:25.747
Bow your head. Let's pray for her.

15:25.952 --> 15:26.941
Cora, bow your head.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.412
Brian, bow your head.

15:28.621 --> 15:30.316
- Mr. Brown, I'm driving.
- Yeah.

15:30.523 --> 15:32.855
The Lord can watch the wheels.
Bow your head.

15:33.059 --> 15:34.185
Mabel, you bow your head.

15:34.394 --> 15:36.521
Brown, if you don't shut the hell up
and...

15:36.730 --> 15:39.028
Bow your head
and put your head in your lap...

15:39.232 --> 15:41.029
...and smother yourself.
Bow your head.

15:41.234 --> 15:43.862
Lord, don't send Madea to hell.

15:44.070 --> 15:47.369
Just give her a little house
right outside the gates of heaven...

15:47.574 --> 15:50.202
...so she can watch all of us go in.

15:50.410 --> 15:51.502
Amen.

15:51.711 --> 15:53.838
- Amen.
- Amen.

15:54.047 --> 15:57.608
But, Madea, you can't make those type
of promises and break them.

15:57.817 --> 15:59.580
- Cora.
- Yes?

15:59.786 --> 16:01.754
- Do me a favor.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:01.955 --> 16:05.857
Put the shut to the up, okay?
The shut to the up.

16:06.059 --> 16:08.960
Mad... Cora, don't you worry.
Just let it go.

16:09.162 --> 16:11.892
When she gets in trouble,
she'll come running to the church.

16:12.098 --> 16:15.261
Madea ain't gonna get in no more
trouble. I ain't gonna have that.

16:15.468 --> 16:17.436
Between you and my daddy,
that's enough.

16:17.637 --> 16:20.401
You ain't getting in trouble.
You got off easy this time.

16:20.607 --> 16:23.337
The hell you talking to? I'm grown.
I am grown, okay, Brian?

16:23.543 --> 16:25.306
You don't tell me nothing. I'm grown.

16:25.512 --> 16:27.810
I ain't got...
I wasn't in trouble that time.

16:28.014 --> 16:30.039
- I don't... You don't tell me nothing.
- Madea.

16:30.250 --> 16:33.686
I was reading this pamphlet from
the courts about anger management.

16:33.887 --> 16:35.821
It says as women get older...

16:36.022 --> 16:38.889
...our bodies don't produce
as many hormones as it needs...

16:39.092 --> 16:40.992
...to stay calm and have stable moods.

16:41.194 --> 16:44.061
But you going to see this doctor
is gonna be real good for you.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.289
I'm not going to no angry manager,
Cora.

16:46.499 --> 16:48.490
What the hell you bring them
down here for?

16:48.701 --> 16:50.828
Why are you yelling at me?
They wanted to come.

16:51.037 --> 16:53.528
What was I supposed to do?
Mr. Brown jumped in the car.

16:53.740 --> 16:55.935
You was happy to see us
when you wanted prayer.

16:56.142 --> 16:59.270
- That's right.
- You need to see one of them doctors.

16:59.479 --> 17:02.607
They gave me one of them,
what they say, Brian?

17:02.816 --> 17:04.579
Coca... Colostomy.

17:07.186 --> 17:09.314
- You had a colonoscopy, Mr. Brown.
- Colostomy?

17:09.521 --> 17:10.579
Same thing.

17:11.089 --> 17:14.548
I thought that fool said Coca-Cola.
Making me thirsty for good old Coke.

17:14.761 --> 17:17.695
Now, Mabel, when we get old,
we gotta keep ourselves checked.

17:17.896 --> 17:19.955
Now, you know,
they checked my prostate.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.396
Mabel, you need
to get your prostate checked too.

17:22.602 --> 17:24.330
Women don't have a prostate,
Mr. Brown.

17:24.537 --> 17:28.165
Cora, I'm telling you,
Madea got a prostate.

17:38.218 --> 17:40.652
You know there's more
where that came from.

17:48.761 --> 17:51.252
- Why you bail me out of jail?
- Because you're a friend.

17:53.299 --> 17:55.767
I don't understand why you...

17:55.969 --> 17:57.527
Why you have to do this.

17:57.737 --> 17:59.295
You was a... You were a smart girl.

17:59.505 --> 18:00.995
You used to get straight A's.

18:01.207 --> 18:02.970
You remember?

18:04.377 --> 18:06.368
- What?
- You really have tricked yourself...

18:06.579 --> 18:08.979
...into believing
that night ain't ever happened.

18:09.182 --> 18:11.207
Well, Josh, it did happen.

18:11.618 --> 18:14.178
And it changed my life forever.

18:18.591 --> 18:20.991
I tried to look for you every day
after that.

18:23.029 --> 18:25.862
You must have been looking
in some pretty high places then.

18:26.065 --> 18:29.193
Candy, I don't understand
why you are out there on those streets.

18:29.402 --> 18:32.803
Look, you deal with things your way
and I'll deal with them mine.

18:33.006 --> 18:36.134
- I don't need you to be judging me.
- I'm not judging you.

18:36.342 --> 18:39.641
Yes, you are. What you do think
you're doing talking to me crazy?

18:39.846 --> 18:41.336
- Will you...?
- Don't you shush me.

18:41.547 --> 18:43.412
Telling me to...
Am I embarrassing you now?

18:43.616 --> 18:45.743
Y'all got something to say too?
What you got?

18:45.952 --> 18:47.681
- Anybody else?
- Please.

18:47.887 --> 18:49.684
I'm not your enemy.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.590
Hey. What's up, Josh?

18:52.792 --> 18:55.818
Chuck, this is an old friend of mine.

18:57.363 --> 18:59.490
Okay. How you doing? I'm Chuck.

19:02.869 --> 19:04.461
Okay.

19:05.672 --> 19:06.832
Hey, baby.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.268
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:08.775 --> 19:10.003
Thought you were in court?

19:10.209 --> 19:12.939
I was. It got kicked.
She wasn't Mirandized.

19:14.213 --> 19:15.840
What's this?

19:16.416 --> 19:17.849
She's a friend of mine.

19:18.051 --> 19:19.484
What's her name?

19:19.686 --> 19:21.449
I...

19:21.921 --> 19:23.912
I tried your friend.

19:24.123 --> 19:25.249
You made bail quickly.

19:26.926 --> 19:29.326
Candy, this is my fiancée, Linda.

19:29.529 --> 19:31.861
Oh, wait. Hold on.
You said that's your fiancée?

19:32.065 --> 19:34.124
You marrying her?

19:36.069 --> 19:37.434
That'll never work.

19:43.409 --> 19:45.070
I gotta go.

19:46.913 --> 19:48.380
Hey, Candy.

19:48.581 --> 19:49.843
Look.

19:50.116 --> 19:52.107
This is my number.

19:52.585 --> 19:54.746
If you need anything,
give me a call, all right?

19:56.055 --> 19:57.522
Yeah.

20:15.708 --> 20:19.439
- Well, are you gonna handle it?
- I... Yeah.

20:19.645 --> 20:22.910
Honey,
you are an assistant district attorney.

20:23.116 --> 20:25.710
You shouldn't hang out
with the likes of those people.

20:25.918 --> 20:27.408
What are you doing with her?

20:27.620 --> 20:29.451
Don't answer that.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.449
She's an old friend.
I was trying to help.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.287
Bad move.

20:38.398 --> 20:41.265
What did I say, Linda?
Didn't I? Didn't I say it?

20:41.467 --> 20:42.491
What did you say?

20:43.436 --> 20:47.167
I was talking to your future wife here.
Remember that?

20:47.507 --> 20:49.873
About the fact
that you feel guilty, Josh.

20:50.076 --> 20:53.944
I know. I made it out of the ghetto too
but I don't apologize for it.

20:54.147 --> 20:57.344
But these people,
oh, they will never let you forget.

20:57.550 --> 21:01.316
As long as you let them do that,
you'll feel a sense of obligation to them.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.785
- Now, am I right or am I right?
- That is not it.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.389
Don't talk, just agree.

21:05.925 --> 21:07.483
Well, whatever it is...

21:07.693 --> 21:11.686
...the point is they were afforded
the same opportunities you were.

21:11.898 --> 21:13.889
You did something, they didn't.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.532
Linda, it's not always that simple.

21:16.869 --> 21:20.168
Just agree to disagree
and change the subject.

21:20.373 --> 21:23.831
- Okay, can we just order some food?
- Yes.

21:26.045 --> 21:28.411
Oh, my dad is having a party here.

21:28.614 --> 21:31.139
I gotta go pick up my kids.
Y'all gotta handle this.

21:31.350 --> 21:35.218
I know Joe ain't having no party
at my damn house.

21:36.856 --> 21:41.156
I know Joe ain't having no party
at my damn house.

21:42.295 --> 21:44.263
Wait, just stay calm.

21:45.231 --> 21:47.529
- Cora, who these people, Cora?
- I don't know.

21:47.733 --> 21:50.861
- Cora, who these people in my house?
- I didn't know.

22:11.557 --> 22:13.491
- Holy smoke.
- Who are all these people?

22:13.693 --> 22:14.682
The music's too loud.

22:14.894 --> 22:18.660
How could Joe have this party?
I know Madea gonna be upset.

22:21.634 --> 22:22.931
Madea is upset.

22:23.136 --> 22:24.626
Hey, sexy.

22:25.304 --> 22:27.864
You look like a bowl
of peach ice cream.

22:30.743 --> 22:33.940
Get out of my face
before I throw this oil all over you.

22:34.147 --> 22:36.945
Oh, now you wanna get kinky, huh?

22:37.250 --> 22:40.447
- Kinky?
- I like that.

22:43.856 --> 22:46.416
- The devil is alive.
- Yeah.

23:03.943 --> 23:07.310
Hey, sexy,
you wanna spend some time with me?

23:07.980 --> 23:09.447
And be my client?

23:09.649 --> 23:11.139
What kind of work she do, Cora?

23:11.350 --> 23:14.114
A lawyer in a sick room,
a doctor in the court room?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.413
She's a... She's a prostitute.

23:16.822 --> 23:18.119
Say it, baby.

23:18.324 --> 23:19.689
I'm a prostitute.

23:19.892 --> 23:23.487
- A prosti-what?
- A prostitute is what she said.

23:23.696 --> 23:26.187
Street walker. Woman of the night.

23:26.699 --> 23:28.860
Oh, Cora, give me that oil.

23:29.068 --> 23:30.330
The devil is alive.

23:30.536 --> 23:33.164
The blood. The blood.

23:33.472 --> 23:35.963
She's Mary Magdalene, Cora.

23:41.214 --> 23:42.841
Madea, just stay calm, okay?

23:43.049 --> 23:45.142
Baby, don't have
no nervous breakdown.

23:45.351 --> 23:47.911
Stay calm, Madea. Just stay calm.

23:49.388 --> 23:52.152
- Mabel, just...
- Where the hell is Joe?

23:52.358 --> 23:53.825
He know I just got out of jail.

23:54.026 --> 23:58.224
Hey, Mabel. Hell, I didn't even know
you was coming home.

23:58.431 --> 24:00.023
How are you doing? Good to see you.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.201
Joe, who the hell are all these people?

24:02.401 --> 24:06.303
When I saw the news,
I said they gonna lock my sister up.

24:06.505 --> 24:10.032
So I've been inviting all these people
so that she could have a good time...

24:10.343 --> 24:12.834
...when she come home and I'm so...

24:13.145 --> 24:15.636
Yeah, right. You know better
than this, don't you, Joe?

24:15.848 --> 24:19.340
- Joe, what you doing? You all right?
- He is smoking out of this pipe.

24:19.552 --> 24:22.851
I'm glad you're home, Mabel.
I'm so glad you're home.

24:23.055 --> 24:24.886
Madea, I just want you to stay calm.

24:25.091 --> 24:27.719
All these people are for you,
Mabel, enjoy yourself.

24:27.927 --> 24:30.725
Enjoy yourself. Excuse me.
Excuse me, sexy slim.

24:30.930 --> 24:33.922
- Just... You look calm. You calm?
- I'm calm. I'm clam.

24:34.133 --> 24:38.126
- You look calm like a quiet storm.
- I'm calm. I'm calm.

24:42.808 --> 24:44.742
The hell you doing upstairs
in my house?

24:44.944 --> 24:47.105
And get the hell out of my bedroom.

24:53.486 --> 24:55.147
She's got a gun!

24:55.354 --> 24:58.983
Run! Run!

24:59.592 --> 25:00.923
I don't wanna die.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.094
I can make it work. I can give you
some Indian hair. That's right.

25:11.304 --> 25:12.362
It'll be $ 75.

25:12.571 --> 25:14.971
You got to make that work.

25:15.174 --> 25:17.233
What about you?
What are you gonna have?

25:17.943 --> 25:19.638
- That's right.
- Hello, ladies.

25:20.513 --> 25:22.606
- All right, thanks.
- There you go.

25:23.015 --> 25:24.573
- How are you doing?
- Thank you.

25:24.784 --> 25:25.910
- Thank you.
- All right?

25:26.118 --> 25:29.815
Y'all take care of yourselves. Listen,
if you need anything, come see me.

25:30.022 --> 25:32.684
- 347 Chowder Lane.
- That's right.

25:32.892 --> 25:34.450
All right.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.491
Take care of yourselves.

25:38.197 --> 25:40.563
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi, Ellen.

25:40.766 --> 25:42.256
This is my friend, Candace.

25:44.337 --> 25:47.067
- Here we go again.
- We've met.

25:47.273 --> 25:51.039
This is my girl. We were in New York
together. I begged her to come here.

25:51.243 --> 25:54.007
- And she finally came.
- Is that right?

25:54.380 --> 25:57.144
- Taking care of yourself?
- Why are you all in my business?

25:57.350 --> 26:01.047
- All right, Candy, Ellen is good people.
- I'm just here to help.

26:01.253 --> 26:05.087
By thumping your Bible at me every five
minutes the way my grandmama did?

26:05.291 --> 26:07.919
I don't know your grandmama
and I don't carry no Bible.

26:08.127 --> 26:09.287
It's at home on my mantel.

26:09.495 --> 26:11.622
You ain't got to carry it.
You know every word.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.196
You better know it.

26:13.399 --> 26:14.923
Amen.

26:16.869 --> 26:18.860
Are you gonna give me some of them
or not?

26:20.506 --> 26:21.803
You asking me?

26:22.007 --> 26:24.202
Go on, act right, man.
She's good people.

26:24.410 --> 26:27.140
May I have some, please?

26:28.013 --> 26:29.640
"May I?"

26:30.282 --> 26:32.842
Girl, you're sounding all educated.

26:34.153 --> 26:35.347
Here.

26:38.424 --> 26:40.483
Here's a voucher for some food
if you need it.

26:44.663 --> 26:47.393
- What?
- You don't know how to say thank you.

26:48.934 --> 26:50.196
Thank you.

26:50.603 --> 26:51.627
You on drugs?

26:51.837 --> 26:53.998
- Why?
- What is it, heroin or coke?

26:54.206 --> 26:57.198
Don't you be touching me. You don't
know me. You need to back up.

26:57.410 --> 26:59.071
- You need some clean needles?
- I do.

26:59.278 --> 27:00.939
- What's wrong with you?
- Here you go.

27:01.147 --> 27:02.614
Thank you.

27:02.815 --> 27:04.476
- Thank you.
- Take care of yourselves.

27:04.683 --> 27:06.981
And, Donna, I'm still waiting.

27:07.486 --> 27:08.885
I know.

27:11.624 --> 27:14.092
Donna, who is that fool?

27:15.094 --> 27:18.461
Man, I've been on these streets
since I was 16 years old.

27:18.664 --> 27:22.225
I've seen all kinds say they come
in the name of one God or another.

27:22.435 --> 27:24.460
But that woman right there...

27:24.670 --> 27:26.228
...she's real.

27:26.439 --> 27:28.999
She's good folks, man.

27:29.408 --> 27:33.367
She'll be around all types
of dope boys, pimps, addicts.

27:33.579 --> 27:35.547
And she treats us all the same.

27:35.748 --> 27:38.182
She preaches down at the prison.

27:39.251 --> 27:41.583
Why she say she waiting on you?

27:43.856 --> 27:46.586
I keep telling her I'll get off my street.

27:50.996 --> 27:52.657
No, sir. Well, I don't...

27:52.865 --> 27:55.026
Well, that's all I have. I...

27:55.935 --> 27:58.529
That's the first and last name.

27:58.737 --> 27:59.931
That's all I have.

28:00.139 --> 28:02.664
Sure. No, I understand.

28:03.742 --> 28:05.869
All right. Okay.

28:06.078 --> 28:08.046
Okay, thank you.

28:10.349 --> 28:12.579
- Any luck?
- No.

28:15.488 --> 28:17.149
What about you?

28:17.356 --> 28:18.721
Nope.

28:19.892 --> 28:22.486
Man, you know, tell me again,
why are we doing this?

28:23.162 --> 28:26.222
I'm just trying to find somebody
to help her get off these streets.

28:26.432 --> 28:29.595
You've... You've never done this before
so it's...

28:30.102 --> 28:31.626
We got history.

28:32.671 --> 28:34.263
Oh, you...

28:34.473 --> 28:37.101
- Not like that.
- You're trying to help this girl, man.

28:37.309 --> 28:40.767
And I've never heard you mention her.
I've known you for, like, three years.

28:40.980 --> 28:45.542
We're supposed to be looking for
vacation spots for your honeymoon.

28:45.751 --> 28:47.412
- We are.
- No, no, no. We.

28:47.620 --> 28:49.986
You called me up,
you said, man, come over here.

28:50.723 --> 28:52.384
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, how are you doing?

28:52.591 --> 28:53.990
- How are you?
- Oh, I am good.

28:54.193 --> 28:57.219
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna leave you lovebirds alone.

28:57.429 --> 28:58.862
- I gotta...
- Where you off to?

28:59.064 --> 29:00.053
I gotta...

29:00.266 --> 29:03.633
- You ain't going nowhere.
- I got a date, so... Yeah.

29:03.836 --> 29:05.997
- What's your date's name?
- Well, lucky girl.

29:06.205 --> 29:08.036
Leave me alone. I'm out.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.174
So today was incredible.

29:10.376 --> 29:13.504
I found these shoes.
The girls are gonna flip out.

29:13.712 --> 29:17.512
I found the most amazing dressmaker
and she agreed to do the dress for us.

29:17.716 --> 29:19.616
- That's great.
- I know.

29:20.052 --> 29:22.748
Did you find any places
for the honeymoon?

29:24.123 --> 29:26.284
No, actually I was...

29:26.959 --> 29:28.153
I was...

29:28.360 --> 29:32.057
I was looking for some of
Candace's family in Texas.

29:33.899 --> 29:36.697
Okay, so you're still talking
about this prostitute?

29:36.902 --> 29:39.769
- Why are you calling her a prostitute?
- That what she is.

29:39.972 --> 29:44.170
Baby, where I'm from, if somebody
needs help, you try to help them out.

29:44.376 --> 29:45.638
Okay, sweetie...

29:45.844 --> 29:48.972
...you know that you can only
help someone that wants to be helped.

29:49.181 --> 29:50.580
Those people don't want help.

29:50.783 --> 29:53.775
- Why do you call them those people?
- I mean, those people.

29:53.986 --> 29:56.750
People like her,
from that side of the tracks.

29:56.956 --> 29:58.821
I'm from the same street.

29:59.024 --> 30:02.016
- We were in college together.
- That doesn't make any difference.

30:02.227 --> 30:04.058
It's not the same thing with you.

30:04.263 --> 30:05.560
Sweetie, she's not like you.

30:05.764 --> 30:09.530
It is her own fault if she didn't
make something of herself.

30:09.735 --> 30:12.761
Linda, you've always had things
handed to you.

30:13.472 --> 30:16.441
You've always been, like,
daddy's little princess.

30:16.642 --> 30:19.076
Until you're on the streets,
you wouldn't understand.

30:19.278 --> 30:20.836
That is my cue to leave.

30:21.246 --> 30:24.181
- I'm gonna let you cool off for a minute.
- Wait, Linda.

30:24.516 --> 30:26.177
- Yes?
- I'm sorry.

30:26.385 --> 30:29.718
I am, but it bothered me seeing
that woman on the street.

30:29.922 --> 30:32.049
- It bothers you.
- Yes, it bothers me.

30:32.257 --> 30:36.284
Okay, when she stops bothering you,
why don't you give me a call?

30:36.495 --> 30:39.396
- Linda. Linda, hey.
- Okay?

30:39.765 --> 30:42.928
- I don't want you to go.
- I don't wanna hear about this girl.

30:43.135 --> 30:44.329
I'm done with her.

30:44.536 --> 30:46.265
Now, you've helped her enough.

30:46.639 --> 30:48.266
You won't hear about it again.

30:56.248 --> 30:58.148
You still out here?

31:00.019 --> 31:02.351
Yeah, girl. It's a slow night.

31:02.554 --> 31:04.852
No, it's not.
Those Army boys just got paid.

31:05.057 --> 31:08.151
Turned down, like, three
when I was here before.

31:08.661 --> 31:10.492
What's up, girl?

31:11.930 --> 31:15.422
I ran into somebody who I knew
from before earlier today.

31:15.634 --> 31:17.192
Oh, I see.

31:17.703 --> 31:20.103
You started thinking
what your life could have been.

31:20.305 --> 31:24.435
No, not me. I know I ain't got no time
to be chasing no dreams.

31:25.277 --> 31:27.507
You ain't like the rest of us, Candy.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.781
You can get out of here
and make something of yourself.

31:30.983 --> 31:33.178
What, me some Betty Crocker mom
or something?

31:33.385 --> 31:35.615
No, you smart.

31:36.555 --> 31:38.523
I see how you be reading them books.

31:38.724 --> 31:43.184
Listen, Terry McMillan ain't doing
nothing to get me no fix, okay?

31:43.729 --> 31:47.756
All I'm saying is if anybody
can get out of here, you can.

31:48.133 --> 31:49.623
I've seen you talk to people.

31:49.835 --> 31:52.429
I've seen you talk your way
out of all kinds of stuff.

31:52.638 --> 31:54.299
You can do it.

31:54.506 --> 31:56.770
Whatever, Donna. Please.

31:56.975 --> 31:59.136
All right, I'm gonna make a deal
with you.

32:00.446 --> 32:03.472
If I get off these streets,
you gotta get off these streets.

32:05.984 --> 32:08.009
All right, that's a bet.

32:08.454 --> 32:10.786
Maybe we can help each other.

32:10.989 --> 32:14.390
Now, you know we always do, girl.
You know what I was thinking about?

32:14.593 --> 32:16.891
- Remember we were in New York?
- Donna!

32:17.096 --> 32:18.723
Candy, come on. Run. Run!

32:33.412 --> 32:35.403
- You think you can hide from me?
- No.

32:35.614 --> 32:39.380
I told you, you ain't gonna be out
here solo, Donna. Do you hear me?

32:39.752 --> 32:42.744
- Okay.
- Now, get your ass out of here.

32:42.955 --> 32:44.286
Okay, Donna. Let's go.

32:44.490 --> 32:46.720
- No, no, no. Not you.
- No. What do you want?

32:46.925 --> 32:48.586
You want a woman.
You don't want her.

32:48.794 --> 32:51.854
- I see what I want. Get out of here.
- She's just been here.

32:52.064 --> 32:55.431
I'm trying to show her the ropes.
She ain't ready. She ain't ready!

32:57.536 --> 32:59.333
Get off of her!

33:02.007 --> 33:05.204
Where you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going, girl?

33:05.410 --> 33:08.675
You ain't going nowhere.
You understand me?

33:55.928 --> 33:58.954
- Where do you think you're going?
- Please, please, please.

33:59.164 --> 34:01.291
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.560
- What, you think that scares me?
- Please.

34:04.770 --> 34:08.069
Please. Please let me go.
Please let me go.

34:08.273 --> 34:10.672
What are you gonna do for me
if I let you go?

34:10.876 --> 34:12.605
What do you want me to do?

34:13.478 --> 34:14.775
You belong to me.

34:14.980 --> 34:16.971
You're my slave.

34:17.181 --> 34:20.811
If a slave wanna be free,
they got to buy their freedom.

34:21.018 --> 34:23.214
Okay. Okay.

34:23.422 --> 34:25.583
I want you to get in that bathroom.

34:25.791 --> 34:27.224
I want you to get cleaned up.

34:27.426 --> 34:29.417
I can get a premium for you.

34:29.862 --> 34:31.887
All right, go on, baby.

34:33.431 --> 34:35.491
Come on, it's all right.

34:40.772 --> 34:44.606
Gonna learn you ain't protected on
these streets unless you got a pimp.

34:44.810 --> 34:46.300
Do you understand?

34:46.511 --> 34:48.842
I got this nice party
I'm gonna take you to.

34:49.047 --> 34:53.074
A lot of new potential clients,
couple of G's easy.

34:53.284 --> 34:55.650
I want you to make yourself
look real nice, girl.

34:55.853 --> 34:57.845
I got a good feeling about you.

34:58.056 --> 35:00.786
You're gonna be
one of my special girls.

35:01.293 --> 35:03.761
Don't be wasting time in there, girl.
Come on, now.

35:03.962 --> 35:06.396
We gotta be running now.
I don't wanna be late.

35:09.868 --> 35:12.837
Get on with that shower in there,
Candy.

35:13.839 --> 35:15.466
What's going on in there?

35:15.674 --> 35:16.971
Candy.

35:17.175 --> 35:18.608
Candy.

35:59.551 --> 36:03.180
Operator, I need district attorney...

36:03.388 --> 36:04.980
...Josh Hardaway.

36:05.190 --> 36:07.954
Just connect me to his phone, please.
It's an emergency.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.239
Hello.

36:25.577 --> 36:27.010
Hey.

36:27.646 --> 36:29.375
You okay?

36:30.482 --> 36:31.608
Are you serious?

36:31.817 --> 36:33.512
Where are you?

36:34.419 --> 36:36.614
Okay, I'm coming right now.

36:36.822 --> 36:39.757
I'm coming r... I'm coming right now.

36:40.158 --> 36:42.854
All right. I know. All right.

36:43.061 --> 36:44.426
Bye.

37:22.868 --> 37:23.960
Candace.

37:24.169 --> 37:25.727
Can you walk? Come on.

37:25.937 --> 37:28.167
Come on. Come on. Come on.

37:28.373 --> 37:29.931
Thanks. I'm okay.

38:43.682 --> 38:45.377
Baby?

38:45.951 --> 38:48.818
I fell asleep.
How come you're not in bed, sweetie?

38:49.020 --> 38:50.988
What? What's the matter?

38:51.690 --> 38:52.952
I can explain. I can...

38:53.158 --> 38:54.386
Is that my robe?

38:54.593 --> 38:57.357
- You can explain?
- She's in trouble. I'm trying to help.

38:57.562 --> 38:58.790
Why did you bring her here?

38:58.997 --> 39:00.464
Linda, she needs somebody.

39:00.665 --> 39:02.257
I don't care what she needs.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.765
Shush? Are you kidding me?

39:04.970 --> 39:07.962
What is it with you and this girl?
What is going on here?

39:08.173 --> 39:10.073
Linda, I told you.

39:10.275 --> 39:12.300
- I'm the only one that can help her out.
- No.

39:12.511 --> 39:16.971
You have some decisions to make
and some thinking to do. I am leaving.

39:17.182 --> 39:20.413
And stop shushing me. Shushing me
so the prostitute can sleep?

39:20.619 --> 39:21.779
I am done, Josh.

39:21.987 --> 39:23.079
I cannot believe this.

39:23.288 --> 39:25.518
Linda, just don't slam the door.

39:25.724 --> 39:27.487
You slammed it.

39:27.859 --> 39:29.349
Can't even shut the door...

39:29.561 --> 39:32.359
You always did know
how to pick them.

39:32.564 --> 39:34.589
She's not your type.

39:36.001 --> 39:38.401
How you know what my type is?

39:38.603 --> 39:40.537
You haven't seen me in five years.

39:40.739 --> 39:42.900
Josh, I know you, okay?

39:43.108 --> 39:44.973
She is not it.

39:45.177 --> 39:48.578
She's entirely too much of a princess.

39:48.780 --> 39:50.941
It ain't gonna work.

39:51.149 --> 39:55.245
I bet...
I bet you ain't even proposed to her.

39:55.687 --> 39:59.020
Then why do you think
we're getting married then, smarty?

39:59.224 --> 40:01.021
Because she told you you were.

40:01.226 --> 40:02.659
Oh, you don't know me.

40:02.861 --> 40:05.125
You think you know me
but you don't know me, girl.

40:05.330 --> 40:07.628
Josh, I know you. We grew up toge...

40:07.832 --> 40:11.427
We spent every day together
when we were kids.

40:11.636 --> 40:13.331
I know you.

40:13.538 --> 40:15.301
Candace, people change.

40:16.575 --> 40:18.566
I know that's right.

40:21.446 --> 40:23.505
- You're shaking. Are you cold?
- No.

40:24.883 --> 40:27.647
This ain't the cold shakes, baby.

40:27.953 --> 40:30.353
When did you start using?
When you got out of school?

40:31.022 --> 40:34.116
I had to find some way to cope
just like you.

40:34.326 --> 40:36.817
What are you talking about, me?

40:37.028 --> 40:41.021
Ambition, working two jobs.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.995
While you were in school full-time?

40:44.202 --> 40:47.069
You did that so you wouldn't have
to think about what happened.

40:47.272 --> 40:50.241
That's an interesting concept you got.

40:50.775 --> 40:53.369
Josh, I don't wanna
talk about this, okay?

40:54.412 --> 40:57.848
All right, we don't have to.
We don't have to talk.

41:01.052 --> 41:02.041
Hey, Josh.

41:02.687 --> 41:03.881
Yeah.

41:04.923 --> 41:09.053
You remember that bed and breakfast
we were gonna open in Savannah?

41:09.294 --> 41:12.161
Down by the river. Bells.

41:12.364 --> 41:13.490
I remember Bells.

41:13.698 --> 41:15.928
- You remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

41:16.468 --> 41:18.436
Oh, Josh.

41:18.637 --> 41:21.128
I was gonna buy it...

41:21.673 --> 41:24.665
...and live happily ever after.

41:25.143 --> 41:27.270
So why didn't you buy it?

41:27.846 --> 41:30.337
I couldn't find a job...

41:32.484 --> 41:37.751
...and I ain't have no money,
I was so hungry.

41:40.392 --> 41:41.757
And then I...

41:41.960 --> 41:43.188
...I met this man.

41:44.296 --> 41:46.787
And he said he loved me.

41:47.599 --> 41:50.534
And he said he was
gonna take care of me.

41:51.269 --> 41:55.103
And he said that if I loved him
that I would...

41:55.540 --> 41:57.770
...sleep with him and his friend.

41:57.976 --> 42:02.174
And it turned into
his other friends without him.

42:02.914 --> 42:05.314
And then strangers.

42:05.984 --> 42:08.248
It took me four years...

42:08.453 --> 42:10.250
...four years...

42:10.455 --> 42:12.582
...to get away from him.

42:13.725 --> 42:15.090
CeCe, I'm sorry.

42:15.560 --> 42:16.822
CeCe?

42:17.295 --> 42:18.421
Yeah.

42:18.630 --> 42:21.963
That little girl,
she died a long time ago.

42:27.005 --> 42:29.405
Boy, are those tears in your eyes?

42:29.974 --> 42:33.466
You better man up. Don't you sit
over there feeling sorry for me.

42:34.212 --> 42:36.407
At least I get paid for what I do now.

42:36.614 --> 42:39.378
You do not get paid for what you do.

42:42.587 --> 42:45.055
I told y'all I ain't got no
anger-manager problem.

42:45.256 --> 42:46.951
Y'all still insisted on me going.

42:47.158 --> 42:48.750
You have a anger-management
problem.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.325
Fine, take me down there then.

42:50.528 --> 42:52.826
That's why I'm gonna get you
one of these.

42:53.031 --> 42:55.522
- One of what?
- This, right here, one of these.

42:55.734 --> 42:58.965
- What is that?
- It's a reminder on how to treat people.

42:59.170 --> 43:01.229
WWJD.

43:01.439 --> 43:02.804
You know what that means?

43:03.241 --> 43:06.301
What that stand for?
What's wrong with Jermaine Dupri?

43:06.511 --> 43:09.105
No. It means "What would Jesus do?"
Everybody know that.

43:09.314 --> 43:11.305
I don't know. Hell.

43:12.117 --> 43:13.948
Did you see that?

43:14.853 --> 43:17.219
- Did you see him?
- Yes, I saw it. What you gonna do?

43:17.422 --> 43:21.483
- Well... What... I'm gonna WWJD.
- Cora, Jesus did not have no car.

43:21.693 --> 43:23.752
- Better go get that fool.
- He's gonna get his.

43:23.962 --> 43:25.020
- No, I can't.
- Cora.

43:25.230 --> 43:27.698
He's gonna get his.
Look. He got stopped by the light.

43:28.299 --> 43:29.857
Well, pull up on him, then.

43:30.068 --> 43:31.831
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do a drive-by.

43:32.036 --> 43:33.697
Madea... No, you're not.

43:33.905 --> 43:36.305
Oh, man, I got this. I got this.

43:36.508 --> 43:37.497
Excuse me, sir.

43:37.709 --> 43:39.040
- Excuse me.
- Hey, fool.

43:39.244 --> 43:42.213
- What?
- You cut in front of me. Did you see?

43:42.414 --> 43:44.382
Go to hell.

43:44.949 --> 43:46.644
Wh... Did... What?

43:47.118 --> 43:49.848
- Did you hear that?
- Did you show him your bracelet?

43:50.054 --> 43:52.887
- Did you show him the WWJD?
- Don't be funny, Madea.

43:53.091 --> 43:54.683
Cora, I didn't raise no punk.

43:54.893 --> 43:57.293
- You better go get that fool.
- I'm no punk, Madea.

43:57.495 --> 44:00.328
- Cora, you ain't gonna be no punk.
- I'm not no punk. I'm not...

44:06.304 --> 44:09.603
I stopped that fool in his face,
you goddamn fool!

44:27.525 --> 44:28.514
Mama.

44:30.195 --> 44:32.186
Girl, I ain't your mama.

44:36.734 --> 44:38.201
Good morning.

44:38.403 --> 44:40.894
What are you, a size 5-, 6?

44:41.105 --> 44:42.265
Why?

44:42.607 --> 44:44.905
Probably a 3.
You don't look like you eat much.

44:45.944 --> 44:47.377
Joshua?

44:47.579 --> 44:48.876
What the hell is this?

44:49.080 --> 44:51.378
We both set up a job interview for you.

44:51.816 --> 44:53.807
I think I can cover that eye up.

44:54.419 --> 44:57.718
We have companies working with our
ministries to get women off the street.

44:57.922 --> 44:59.253
That's if you wanna be.

44:59.457 --> 45:01.322
Who said I wanted to be, huh?

45:01.526 --> 45:03.756
- Candy, that's what you wanted.
- Well, I told you.

45:03.962 --> 45:06.931
Sometimes women like her
say one thing one day.

45:07.398 --> 45:09.559
And then they wake up
and say another thing.

45:09.767 --> 45:11.860
What do you mean girls...?
You don't know me.

45:12.070 --> 45:15.665
Chicks. Junkies like you with
a problem say one thing one day...

45:15.874 --> 45:18.342
...and another the other
because you're on that stuff.

45:18.910 --> 45:21.470
- Go to hell.
- You go first.

45:22.046 --> 45:23.911
I ain't no damn addict.

45:26.050 --> 45:27.312
Candy.

45:27.519 --> 45:32.183
Candy, if the public defender can
show the judge that you got a job...

45:32.390 --> 45:33.948
...it's gonna look really good.

45:34.158 --> 45:36.149
And they may even
suspend your sentence.

45:36.361 --> 45:37.350
I need to know.

45:39.097 --> 45:40.724
I need you to try this, please.

45:40.932 --> 45:42.058
Fine.

45:42.267 --> 45:43.791
Fine.

45:44.002 --> 45:45.469
Fine.

45:48.673 --> 45:49.765
Thank you.

45:49.974 --> 45:51.703
Okay, we'll see you there.

45:51.910 --> 45:55.505
I gotta go to work. After you're done,
can you come to the courthouse?

45:55.713 --> 45:59.843
I wanna talk to your lawyer. I'm gonna
see if I can help him through this.

46:00.051 --> 46:01.518
Okay?

46:01.719 --> 46:05.211
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

46:13.731 --> 46:15.824
You wanna try to get this job or not?

46:19.370 --> 46:22.032
I told them I didn't need
to come here and see you, okay?

46:22.407 --> 46:24.932
Well, you know,
I don't usually see people individually.

46:25.143 --> 46:29.136
But when I saw this tape
of you getting arrested...

46:29.347 --> 46:31.815
...I thought I have got
to talk to this woman.

46:32.016 --> 46:36.077
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

46:36.287 --> 46:39.313
First of all, ain't nothing wrong
with me. Secondly, I'm not angry.

46:39.524 --> 46:40.752
Okay? I'm not angry.

46:40.959 --> 46:42.824
- You seem angry now.
- No, I'm not angry.

46:43.027 --> 46:45.325
This is how I am.
I don't have no hostility at all.

46:45.530 --> 46:48.829
Well, do you have to be in control
all the time of everything?

46:49.033 --> 46:51.433
I don't have to be.
I ain't got no problem with that.

46:51.769 --> 46:53.361
Well, then why
do you get so angry?

46:55.373 --> 46:58.638
I keep trying to tell you
and that judge that I do not get angry.

46:58.843 --> 47:00.208
Somebody do something to me...

47:00.411 --> 47:02.504
...I do something to them.
That's common sense.

47:02.714 --> 47:06.115
- So you believe in getting even?
- Hell to the yeah.

47:06.317 --> 47:08.717
Why do you feel
you gotta get somebody all the time?

47:08.920 --> 47:11.150
"Get him, get him."
You don't think that's angry?

47:11.356 --> 47:13.551
If they: "Got me,"
I gotta get them, get them.

47:13.758 --> 47:16.659
- That's what it is.
- Then, what you call getting got...

47:16.861 --> 47:19.386
...is different than what
other people call getting got.

47:19.597 --> 47:21.690
It doesn't take much to get you,
does it?

47:21.899 --> 47:24.663
When you getting got, somebody
got you, then you go get them.

47:24.869 --> 47:26.234
Everybody's gonna get got.

47:26.437 --> 47:28.371
But if you're getting somebody
got you...

47:28.573 --> 47:30.040
...when they didn't get you...

47:30.241 --> 47:32.732
...you're getting the gotters,
they didn't do anything.

47:32.944 --> 47:35.174
But if the gotters get me,
I'm gonna get my Glock.

47:35.380 --> 47:39.248
Yeah, well... But you don't get
the Glock when you hadn't been got.

47:39.450 --> 47:41.816
What I'm trying to explain,
I don't care who got me.

47:42.020 --> 47:45.285
- I'll get them first. Get me, I'll get you.
- Why is it so important?

47:45.857 --> 47:48.155
Okay. I'm tired of you
asking me these questions.

47:48.359 --> 47:49.621
I didn't sign up for this.

47:49.827 --> 47:51.692
It's the judge
that told me to come here.

47:51.896 --> 47:54.990
Everybody wants to get even.
Everybody wanna get even.

47:55.299 --> 47:56.391
All right, all right.

47:56.601 --> 47:59.001
Look, let's just talk
about your childhood, okay?

47:59.203 --> 48:01.637
- Let's talk about your childhood.
- Talk about yours.

48:01.839 --> 48:03.966
Let's talk about your childhood.

48:04.175 --> 48:06.302
Let's talk about your childhood.

48:09.714 --> 48:12.945
Talking about my childhood
isn't gonna help us.

48:13.618 --> 48:16.246
- What was your childhood like?
- What was yours like?

48:16.454 --> 48:18.354
Why...? Let's talk about your anger.

48:18.556 --> 48:22.822
- That's why you're here, right?
- I'm not angry. I don't know why.

48:23.461 --> 48:27.022
- Let's just try another approach, okay?
- Let's try another approach.

48:27.265 --> 48:28.960
Do you sleep well at night?

48:29.167 --> 48:30.498
Do you sleep well at night?

48:30.968 --> 48:33.266
Let's try not to answer a question
with a question.

48:33.471 --> 48:35.701
Could we do that?
Could we at least do that?

48:35.907 --> 48:37.932
If we stop asking me
all these questions...

48:38.142 --> 48:40.201
...I won't have to answer
with a question.

48:40.411 --> 48:43.938
- Can you stop? Can you just stop?
- Can you just stop? Can you just stop?

48:45.550 --> 48:48.678
- Are you getting angry, doctor?
- Okay. This isn't getting anywhere.

48:48.886 --> 48:52.344
- This is not getting anywhere.
- I think I am gonna talk to the judge.

48:52.557 --> 48:54.388
This is getting nowhere. We're done.

48:54.592 --> 48:55.957
- Thank you.
- Okay. That's good.

48:56.160 --> 48:59.561
- Wonderful to see you. Yes. Right.
- Yeah, well... Yeah, great.

49:00.798 --> 49:04.359
- Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.
- Wait a minute.

49:05.169 --> 49:07.535
- Well?
- This lady is out of control.

49:07.739 --> 49:09.138
She is... I can't help her.

49:09.974 --> 49:12.738
Wait a minute now, wait a minute now.
Now, you're the best.

49:13.044 --> 49:17.538
- Go see somebody else. I'm done.
- Come on, Cora, here.

49:17.749 --> 49:20.047
Oh, what am I gonna...?

49:20.251 --> 49:22.583
Nobody gonna be able to help.
We ain't gonna...

49:26.858 --> 49:28.086
Linda.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.418
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:30.628 --> 49:32.186
I've been trying to call you.

49:32.396 --> 49:34.660
You know what, I got really busy
with some stuff.

49:34.866 --> 49:36.857
You're avoiding me, right?

49:37.335 --> 49:39.769
- No.
- I can explain.

49:39.971 --> 49:42.531
Look, this isn't making
any sense to me, okay?

49:42.740 --> 49:44.435
This girl,
she popped out of nowhere.

49:44.642 --> 49:47.133
Look, what if I had a pimp
who was a friend of mine.

49:47.345 --> 49:49.506
And he's in town for a month or so.

49:49.714 --> 49:52.945
And he needs a place to sleep
so he's on my couch in your bathrobe.

49:53.151 --> 49:54.675
How do you feel about that? Okay?

49:54.886 --> 49:57.252
I mean seriously,
what would you have me think?

49:57.455 --> 50:00.322
- I know it sounds bad...
- We have built cases for death...

50:00.525 --> 50:02.755
...on less than this.
- What do you want me to do?

50:03.327 --> 50:05.625
I just want you to let this go.

50:05.830 --> 50:09.061
I just want you to let her go back
to wherever it is she came from.

50:09.267 --> 50:11.701
Josh, this is not our responsibility.

50:12.436 --> 50:14.233
- Look, I gotta go.
- Okay.

50:14.438 --> 50:16.929
- Can we finish this later?
- All right. I'll call you.

50:17.141 --> 50:18.938
- Okay.
- All right.

50:19.143 --> 50:21.168
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on, man?

50:21.379 --> 50:23.574
- Nothing. You...
- I don't wanna talk about it.

50:23.781 --> 50:25.715
- We don't have to talk about it.
- Please.

50:25.917 --> 50:29.114
I may have found a possible lead
for a brother of hers.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.582
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:30.788 --> 50:32.813
- Thank you, man.
- It's all good, bro.

50:33.024 --> 50:34.286
- Yeah.
- It's what I do.

50:34.492 --> 50:36.892
You know, it's funny,
they really don't get along.

50:54.645 --> 50:56.772
It says here that you went to college.

50:56.981 --> 50:59.211
Yeah, I did two years.

50:59.717 --> 51:01.412
What happened?

51:01.619 --> 51:02.847
I ain't finished.

51:03.054 --> 51:04.817
I see.

51:08.893 --> 51:11.919
There are some blanks here
that you didn't fill out.

51:12.129 --> 51:14.324
I don't know the answer.
What you want me do?

51:14.532 --> 51:16.193
Looking at this application...

51:16.400 --> 51:19.631
...tells me that you don't
finish anything.

51:19.837 --> 51:21.304
So why should we hire you?

51:21.505 --> 51:23.302
Listen, man, I just need a job.

51:23.507 --> 51:25.998
You're gonna give me one or not?
It's really simple.

51:33.484 --> 51:35.281
How bad do you want it?

51:54.138 --> 51:57.369
I won't ask you to do anything
you haven't done a million times.

51:57.575 --> 51:59.702
I've seen your record.

52:10.254 --> 52:14.156
- What happened?
- Your Christian help ain't so Christian.

52:19.030 --> 52:21.089
This is what your A-word get.

52:21.299 --> 52:23.392
You're supposed to help these girls.

52:23.601 --> 52:26.035
You know how you set her back?

52:26.237 --> 52:28.330
Dear Jesus.

52:32.009 --> 52:36.070
I don't know where the hell Cora is at.
I told her I need to go to the store.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.180
People always told me
I can't be driving.

52:38.382 --> 52:42.113
- She knows I need to go to the store.
- That child's gonna leave you to starve.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.584
I told you,
that the way you were treating her...

52:44.789 --> 52:47.451
...she's gonna leave you
to starve to death one day.

52:47.658 --> 52:49.990
- And now this time...
- Shut up, bastard.

52:51.262 --> 52:52.889
Oh, no. Hello.

52:53.097 --> 52:55.327
- Cora.
- <i>Yeah, hello, Madea. Yeah.</i>

52:55.533 --> 52:57.023
- Cora.
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

52:57.234 --> 52:59.532
Where the hell you at?

52:59.837 --> 53:01.429
I'm still at the hair salon.

53:01.639 --> 53:04.267
What the hell are you doing?
You've been there five hours.

53:04.475 --> 53:07.376
Your hair ain't an inch and a half long.
What are they doing?

53:07.578 --> 53:10.638
I'm coming. I'm just trying to...
Can I have some me time, please?

53:13.985 --> 53:16.419
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

53:17.021 --> 53:20.115
- You need some what?
- <i>Some me time.</i>

53:20.891 --> 53:22.358
Some what?

53:22.560 --> 53:25.620
<i>Some me time. Some time for myself.</i>

53:25.930 --> 53:27.158
- Cora.
- Yes, ma'am.

53:27.365 --> 53:30.198
- Did I ever ask you for some me time?
- <i>No, ma'am.</i>

53:30.401 --> 53:32.926
Did I ask you for some me time
when I had to get up...

53:33.137 --> 53:35.071
...every four hours
and cook for you...

53:35.272 --> 53:37.570
...until you were 17 years old?
- <i>No.</i>

53:37.775 --> 53:41.040
Did I ask you for some me time
when I had to hit that stripper pole...

53:41.245 --> 53:43.839
...every night trying to bring money
into this house?

53:44.048 --> 53:46.380
- Did I ask you for some me time then?
- <i>No, ma'am.</i>

53:46.584 --> 53:50.247
Old men up there trying to make it
drizzle, they sure couldn't make it rain.

53:50.454 --> 53:53.116
- What the hell is me time?
- <i>I'm just taking care of myself.</i>

53:53.324 --> 53:55.258
- <i>Getting some me time.</i>
- Time for nothing.

53:55.459 --> 53:56.483
I'm going to the store.

53:56.694 --> 54:00.653
- I'm a grown woman. I'll go myself.
- <i>You can't go to the store.</i>

54:00.865 --> 54:03.095
You're not supposed to drive.
I'll be there soon.

54:03.300 --> 54:05.495
Who the hell are you
to tell me I can't drive.

54:05.703 --> 54:08.399
- If I feel like driving, I'm driving.
- <i>You can't drive...</i>

54:08.606 --> 54:09.766
Shut the hell up.

54:09.974 --> 54:13.034
You get in that car, you're going down.
I'm not playing around.

54:13.244 --> 54:15.906
You're going down, you understand?

54:16.647 --> 54:18.945
I'll be glad when you go down.

54:19.150 --> 54:21.414
Down to the graveyard
and become some maggot food.

54:21.619 --> 54:23.314
I'm hungry. What I'm supposed to do?

54:23.521 --> 54:24.681
Just sit up in this house?

54:24.889 --> 54:26.516
You can miss a few meals.

54:26.724 --> 54:27.782
One or two.

54:28.459 --> 54:29.892
Three or seven.

54:30.895 --> 54:32.760
Nine or eleven.

54:33.564 --> 54:36.089
Keep it up, Joe. Keep it up.

54:36.300 --> 54:39.360
Oh, them people called.
You ain't gotta worry about no food.

54:39.570 --> 54:41.697
You can call them,
they'll bring it down here.

54:43.541 --> 54:45.839
What are you talking about?
Stop smoking that weed.

54:46.043 --> 54:48.136
What the hell you talking about?
You're crazy.

54:48.345 --> 54:50.506
They said they'd give you
three meals a day...

54:50.714 --> 54:54.582
...and they'll give you a percentage on
the people who come through and pay.

54:54.785 --> 54:57.583
- Where they feed you that much?
- One of the whales died.

54:57.788 --> 55:00.086
They need another whale
at the aquarium.

55:00.291 --> 55:03.055
Go on down there
and swim around for them.

55:03.928 --> 55:05.520
You rusty old bastard.

55:05.729 --> 55:08.197
You fart and dust come out. Go to hell.

55:08.399 --> 55:10.230
Dead man walking.

55:10.434 --> 55:12.868
Walking the green mile,
getting her out for Jesus.

55:13.070 --> 55:16.801
I'm gonna walk the green mile
getting right for Jesus.

55:25.850 --> 55:28.318
I don't know what you're blowing at,
but keep blowing.

55:28.519 --> 55:30.885
Come on, grandma!

55:35.392 --> 55:37.360
You coming...? You coming out?

55:37.561 --> 55:39.654
Hey. You coming out?

55:39.864 --> 55:42.765
- Move it, lady!
- I guess you ain't coming out.

55:48.939 --> 55:51.100
I like them shoes.

55:52.510 --> 55:55.138
Come on, come on, come on!

55:56.380 --> 56:00.373
Here's a spot here. I got the groceries,
now I just need to get up in here.

56:00.584 --> 56:02.347
Come on out.

56:13.164 --> 56:17.794
I know... Did she...?
I know damn well that you just...

56:18.002 --> 56:19.060
Excuse me.

56:19.270 --> 56:20.965
Excuse me.

56:21.172 --> 56:24.801
Lady, I know damn well you saw me
getting ready to take this spot.

56:25.809 --> 56:27.106
I saw you.

56:27.311 --> 56:28.300
I took it.

56:28.512 --> 56:31.310
Why don't you move your little car
before I move it for you?

56:33.551 --> 56:35.348
Okay, go on in the store.

56:35.819 --> 56:39.516
Go on in the store. Just walk off. Just
walk off like you bad. You bad. Okay.

56:41.992 --> 56:46.588
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I said I was waiting for that spot, lady.

56:46.830 --> 56:49.264
Well, it's my spot now, grandma.

56:49.466 --> 56:52.264
Lady. Lady, look here...
Lady. Lady, let me explain some...

56:52.469 --> 56:56.565
- You gonna follow me into the store?
- Lady, let me explain something to you.

56:56.774 --> 56:58.708
Lord, have mercy.
Lord, have mercy.

56:58.909 --> 57:02.902
She's gonna make me
tear the K and the B off of this Kmart.

57:03.113 --> 57:04.341
I'm gonna back up.

57:04.548 --> 57:08.541
I ought to run into her, Lord help me.
I don't wanna get in no trouble, Lord.

57:08.752 --> 57:10.242
Help me, Jesus.

57:10.454 --> 57:14.288
Help me, Lord. You know I'm ready
to go drive straight through this glass.

57:14.491 --> 57:16.550
That's right. I'm gonna beat her ass.

57:25.703 --> 57:30.868
<i>Attention, Kmart shoppers.</i>
<i>We have a manager's special...</i>

57:46.890 --> 57:49.051
No!

57:49.260 --> 57:50.852
Are you insane?

57:51.528 --> 57:53.223
Didn't I tell you that was my spot...

57:53.430 --> 57:56.831
...and you gonna jump in front of me
and take my damn parking spot?

57:57.034 --> 57:59.400
Are you insane? Put my car down!

57:59.603 --> 58:05.235
- Okay, I'm gonna put it down for you.
- Old woman, put my car down now!

58:05.442 --> 58:06.875
Okay.

58:19.390 --> 58:22.120
My husband is a police officer.

58:22.326 --> 58:24.851
And he is on his way right now.

58:25.062 --> 58:28.930
I ain't scared of no po-po.
Call the po-po. Call the po-po.

58:30.834 --> 58:37.797
Honey, this woman, this Jemima
the Hutt, she ruined my car!

58:38.008 --> 58:40.203
I'll get the hell out of here.
If he wants me...

58:40.411 --> 58:43.244
...he better come to my house
to get me.

58:43.447 --> 58:45.608
He will!

58:45.816 --> 58:47.215
Get over here now!

58:47.418 --> 58:48.908
The Kmart!

58:52.189 --> 58:54.020
Am I forgiven?

58:54.291 --> 58:56.350
After those flowers
and those chocolates?

58:56.560 --> 58:59.927
- Yes.
- And that great movie that we saw?

59:00.130 --> 59:02.064
You are definitely working on it.

59:02.266 --> 59:04.996
That's good. Because I do not like it
when you're mad at me.

59:05.202 --> 59:07.796
Well, I don't like being mad at you.

59:09.440 --> 59:10.429
Oh, boy.

59:10.641 --> 59:12.802
- Why don't we go inside and make up?
- Let's go.

59:13.010 --> 59:14.671
Okay.

59:27.124 --> 59:30.321
- Don't touch me.
- Candy, it's me. It's Josh.

59:30.527 --> 59:31.721
- Josh.
- Yeah.

59:31.929 --> 59:34.261
She's probably strung out
on something.

59:34.465 --> 59:36.558
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

59:36.767 --> 59:41.136
- I'm sorry.
- You ain't gotta be sorry. All right?

59:42.039 --> 59:44.530
- Okay, rest, rest.
- Just try to relax.

59:44.742 --> 59:47.506
I promise. I'm trying. I'm trying.

59:48.178 --> 59:49.270
Rest, rest.

59:49.480 --> 59:52.108
You have never done that for me.

59:57.354 --> 59:59.219
What are you talking about, Linda?

59:59.423 --> 01:00:00.685
This.

01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:02.859
The care that you're showing her.

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.028
You've never done that for me.

01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:10.561
Baby, please, not tonight.

01:00:11.101 --> 01:00:12.398
Okay?

01:00:12.603 --> 01:00:14.571
Josh, you're in love with her.

01:00:14.772 --> 01:00:17.935
What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to help out a friend.

01:00:18.142 --> 01:00:21.634
I don't even know how to compete
with a drug-addicted prostitute.

01:00:21.845 --> 01:00:24.279
Linda, there is nothing
going on with us.

01:00:24.481 --> 01:00:26.972
I have to go right now.
I can't do this.

01:00:27.184 --> 01:00:29.152
- I can't do this. No.
- Where are you going?

01:00:29.353 --> 01:00:31.844
- I can't do this.
- Linda.

01:00:34.858 --> 01:00:37.918
Please, come and lay with me, please.

01:00:38.328 --> 01:00:39.761
Look, Candy.

01:00:40.964 --> 01:00:43.558
I don't think that would be
a good idea, you know?

01:00:43.767 --> 01:00:46.327
I don't mean like that.
Remember when we were little...

01:00:46.537 --> 01:00:51.270
...and my stepdad would be trying
to get me, he knew you'd protect me.

01:00:51.475 --> 01:00:53.534
Please, Josh, please.

01:00:53.744 --> 01:00:56.235
Josh, please. Josh.

01:01:08.325 --> 01:01:09.815
All right.

01:01:10.761 --> 01:01:12.058
All right.

01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:15.858
Okay.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.991
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:22.538
<i>This is the DeKalb County</i>
<i>SWAT Team.</i>

01:01:22.739 --> 01:01:26.038
<i>Put your hands in the air</i>
<i>and walk backwards.</i>

01:01:26.243 --> 01:01:28.006
<i>These are your Miranda rights.</i>

01:01:28.212 --> 01:01:30.077
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.771
<i>If you give up</i>
<i>the right to remain silent...</i>

01:01:32.983 --> 01:01:36.749
<i>... anything you say can and will be</i>
<i>used against you in a court of law.</i>

01:01:36.954 --> 01:01:39.980
<i>You have the right to an attorney</i>
<i>and have an attorney present...</i>

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:42.715
- Don't move!
- I ain't going down without a fight.

01:01:42.926 --> 01:01:46.657
- What you gonna do? Come on.
- You have the right to remain...

01:01:48.765 --> 01:01:52.030
Don't... Put me down.
You're giving me a mammogram.

01:02:12.689 --> 01:02:14.316
Candace.

01:02:16.627 --> 01:02:18.686
Cand... Candy.

01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:38.973
Good morning.

01:02:39.449 --> 01:02:41.974
- You scared me.
- What are you doing here so early?

01:02:42.519 --> 01:02:45.215
I am preparing for court.

01:02:45.422 --> 01:02:48.084
You are preparing for court, huh?

01:02:49.259 --> 01:02:51.124
This is the...

01:02:51.461 --> 01:02:53.190
...Candace Collin's, Sarah Lester?

01:02:53.397 --> 01:02:56.696
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I remember this one.

01:02:57.067 --> 01:02:58.466
This is Sarah Lester.

01:02:59.536 --> 01:03:01.970
Yeah, Sarah... Sarah Lester.

01:03:02.172 --> 01:03:04.037
This case was closed
a couple years ago.

01:03:07.811 --> 01:03:10.473
Are you padding this woman's file
with a closed case?

01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:13.377
- Chuck, let me handle this, all right?
- You can't do that.

01:03:13.584 --> 01:03:14.710
It's done.

01:03:14.918 --> 01:03:19.014
So wait, wait, wait. Is this how you've
been winning all your cases, huh?

01:03:19.222 --> 01:03:21.850
Is this how you've been
winning all your cases, Linda?

01:03:22.459 --> 01:03:24.393
I'm not gonna stand by
and let you do this.

01:03:24.595 --> 01:03:25.653
- I gotta...
- What?

01:03:25.862 --> 01:03:27.762
What do you have to do?

01:03:28.098 --> 01:03:30.566
Don't you forget
your bar exam, baby.

01:03:30.767 --> 01:03:32.997
You remember how you cheated?

01:03:34.037 --> 01:03:35.902
Don't try me, Chuck.

01:03:36.106 --> 01:03:37.835
I have the proof.

01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:39.702
And I will use it.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.345
Why are you doing this?

01:03:45.716 --> 01:03:48.207
I mean,
this woman has done nothing to you.

01:03:48.418 --> 01:03:50.249
How would you know that?

01:03:54.257 --> 01:03:56.452
He's not in love with her.

01:03:57.127 --> 01:03:58.685
He loves you.

01:03:59.363 --> 01:04:02.298
How deep is your commitment
to this girl, Josh?

01:04:02.699 --> 01:04:04.690
You know, she's a friend.

01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:07.161
A friend?

01:04:09.973 --> 01:04:11.804
You know what a binge addict is?

01:04:12.976 --> 01:04:13.965
No.

01:04:14.177 --> 01:04:17.408
They could stay clean
for long periods of time.

01:04:17.648 --> 01:04:23.712
Then something sets them off and they
can go off for days, weeks and binge.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.150
Because this doesn't just go away
like a cold.

01:04:26.356 --> 01:04:28.916
This is a disease that has to be cured.

01:04:29.559 --> 01:04:34.792
And if you're in it for the wrong reasons
it's gonna destroy you so fast.

01:04:38.035 --> 01:04:42.301
I'm gonna ask you again. How deep
is your commitment to this girl, Josh?

01:04:52.015 --> 01:04:53.642
When we were...

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.080
We were both back in college...

01:04:56.286 --> 01:04:57.844
...she...

01:04:58.221 --> 01:05:02.658
I was the only person
that she knew at the school.

01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:04.827
And I knew her
from the neighborhood.

01:05:05.028 --> 01:05:08.361
You know, the other students,
they really used to make fun of her.

01:05:08.565 --> 01:05:11.466
You know, like her hair
and her clothes.

01:05:11.668 --> 01:05:14.000
I started getting embarrassed.

01:05:14.538 --> 01:05:17.530
And they...

01:05:19.576 --> 01:05:21.009
I started avoiding her.

01:05:21.211 --> 01:05:25.011
When I was on the football team
we were having this, like, big party.

01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:26.872
And...

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:29.248
...they told me...

01:05:29.453 --> 01:05:32.149
...to invite Candy over, you know,
so I did.

01:05:32.355 --> 01:05:34.380
I had a date. I really didn't wanna...

01:05:35.325 --> 01:05:38.317
I really didn't wanna be there.
They told me that they would...

01:05:38.528 --> 01:05:42.521
...you know, like,
keep her company while I was gone...

01:05:43.467 --> 01:05:45.628
...and I came back that night.

01:05:47.137 --> 01:05:48.229
And...

01:05:58.248 --> 01:06:00.011
I came back...

01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:02.515
I came back that night.

01:06:06.156 --> 01:06:08.454
I came back that night.

01:06:09.025 --> 01:06:11.084
And I went in my room.

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:14.761
And...

01:06:22.472 --> 01:06:24.440
...they raped her.

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:26.941
They raped her.

01:06:27.144 --> 01:06:28.338
And I didn't do...

01:06:28.545 --> 01:06:31.173
I didn't do nothing about it.

01:06:31.882 --> 01:06:34.476
I didn't do nothing about it. I'm like...

01:06:34.684 --> 01:06:36.948
...you know, I'm like... What?

01:06:37.154 --> 01:06:39.850
What? Candy, I'm sorry.

01:06:40.056 --> 01:06:42.183
I never told her I'm sorry.

01:06:42.392 --> 01:06:43.916
Josh, look at me, Josh.

01:06:44.361 --> 01:06:46.295
You can't carry that weight.

01:06:46.496 --> 01:06:48.930
- Why did I...? Oh, God, I had to go.
- You... Josh...

01:06:49.566 --> 01:06:50.794
...look at me.

01:06:51.334 --> 01:06:53.393
- Josh, look at me, please.
- Yes, I get it.

01:06:53.603 --> 01:06:55.696
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- Look at me. Look at me.

01:06:55.906 --> 01:06:58.807
- You can't carry that weight.
- Okay.

01:06:59.376 --> 01:07:02.277
She had problems
long before that party.

01:07:06.316 --> 01:07:07.408
- Mabel.
- Brown.

01:07:07.617 --> 01:07:09.847
Listen,
I'm trying to see Judge Mablean.

01:07:10.053 --> 01:07:12.681
- Will you please be quiet.
- I'm trying to pray for you.

01:07:12.889 --> 01:07:15.983
God don't like you.
He grew you in a Petri dish, Brown.

01:07:16.193 --> 01:07:18.889
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need you to help me here.

01:07:19.095 --> 01:07:20.756
Hey, hey, Brian, hey.

01:07:21.097 --> 01:07:23.827
Judge Mablean
always give me a slap on the wrist.

01:07:24.034 --> 01:07:26.400
This is not Judge Mablean.
This judge is tough.

01:07:26.603 --> 01:07:28.969
- How tough could he be?
- All rise. The honorable...

01:07:29.172 --> 01:07:31.299
...Judge Mathis presiding.

01:07:34.110 --> 01:07:36.078
You may be seated. First case...

01:07:36.279 --> 01:07:39.305
...DeKalb County
calls Mabel Simmons.

01:07:39.516 --> 01:07:40.540
Wait a minute.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.718
- Is that who the hell I think it is?
- Yes.

01:07:42.919 --> 01:07:48.084
- It's all spelled out there, Your Honor.
- Yeah, I'm looking at this case.

01:07:48.658 --> 01:07:51.183
And your record is ridiculous,
ma'am.

01:07:51.394 --> 01:07:54.022
I don't even know
how you still on the street.

01:07:54.231 --> 01:07:55.926
- Your Honor, the reaso...
- I'm talking.

01:07:56.633 --> 01:07:59.932
You should have been locked up
a long time ago with this.

01:08:00.136 --> 01:08:01.865
- Your Honor...
- Look, I speak...

01:08:02.305 --> 01:08:03.431
...you listen.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:06.438
And then I will allow you to respond,
you understand?

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:07.934
Yes, sir.

01:08:08.144 --> 01:08:10.635
Don't you go there, he talking.
Y'all better get it.

01:08:10.847 --> 01:08:12.109
- Mabel, be quiet.
- Madea.

01:08:12.315 --> 01:08:13.441
Better be quiet.

01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:16.676
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- Now it's my turn to talk?

01:08:16.886 --> 01:08:21.290
You've heard the saying, "Speak when
you're spoken to or otherwise shut up."

01:08:21.491 --> 01:08:23.515
It's time to say it.
That's how this go, huh?

01:08:23.727 --> 01:08:25.058
I don't have time for this.

01:08:25.261 --> 01:08:29.698
It's time for some sentencing. Bailiff,
what time you have on your watch?

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:31.197
Five to 10, judge.

01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:33.528
Five to ten, that's your sentence.

01:08:33.737 --> 01:08:35.295
- Have a good day.
- Oh, hell, no.

01:08:35.505 --> 01:08:38.770
You gonna give me five years?
You ain't gonna take me back to jail...

01:08:38.975 --> 01:08:41.205
Come here, what you gonna do?
What the hell are...?

01:08:45.448 --> 01:08:47.973
Gonna take me out of here.
I ain't going. I ain't going.

01:08:48.184 --> 01:08:49.582
I ain't going. I ain't going.

01:08:49.786 --> 01:08:51.685
I ain't going. I...

01:09:05.201 --> 01:09:06.429
Linda.

01:09:06.636 --> 01:09:08.694
- Oh, hey, baby.
- Hey.

01:09:10.073 --> 01:09:12.939
- Thanks for letting me borrow this.
- Oh, sure.

01:09:13.243 --> 01:09:14.403
How'd it go today?

01:09:14.844 --> 01:09:16.209
- Seventeen years.
- What?

01:09:16.412 --> 01:09:18.506
Seventeen years?
Baby, it was only two counts.

01:09:18.715 --> 01:09:20.649
Sweetie, you didn't see
her New York sheet.

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:22.750
It is as long as my arm.

01:09:23.153 --> 01:09:25.279
- Wow, I had no idea she...
- I know, I know.

01:09:25.488 --> 01:09:27.979
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I really tried...

01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:30.658
...to be lenient with her.

01:09:30.961 --> 01:09:33.725
But, you know,
once the judge saw the charges...

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:36.558
...and on top of that,
she didn't show up today.

01:09:37.701 --> 01:09:39.430
You know, maybe it's for the best.

01:09:39.636 --> 01:09:42.127
Maybe now
she can get her life together.

01:09:43.506 --> 01:09:45.371
Maybe you're right.

01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:49.403
So she's still at your place?

01:09:49.612 --> 01:09:51.603
No, she left.

01:09:51.814 --> 01:09:53.805
Maybe now, I can...

01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:57.451
...stop being mad at you and we can
go back to planning our future?

01:09:57.654 --> 01:09:59.246
I would like that.

01:09:59.756 --> 01:10:01.223
Me too.

01:10:03.259 --> 01:10:05.489
- All right.
- Okay.

01:10:31.988 --> 01:10:33.853
Hey, sweet thing.

01:10:35.425 --> 01:10:36.949
What you looking for?

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.991
A good time.

01:10:39.195 --> 01:10:41.129
What's it going to cost me?

01:10:41.331 --> 01:10:44.300
I'll give you a special, $50.

01:10:44.534 --> 01:10:46.058
Get in.

01:10:51.775 --> 01:10:53.572
Where are you going?
Do you wanna party?

01:10:53.777 --> 01:10:55.836
You need a date?

01:10:56.046 --> 01:10:57.411
Hey.

01:10:57.614 --> 01:10:59.081
Come on.

01:12:15.024 --> 01:12:17.390
Put your damn hands off me.
Put your hands off me.

01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:21.496
I'm telling y'all, ain't nobody... I ain't
scared of none of you. I ain't scared.

01:12:21.698 --> 01:12:25.361
Yeah, keep it up. Keep it up.
I ain't scared of none of you.

01:12:30.507 --> 01:12:32.771
I'm here, now let me go.

01:12:33.209 --> 01:12:34.767
What the hell wrong with you?

01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:36.972
How you doing?

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.175
Guess this is my cell.

01:12:39.382 --> 01:12:42.545
What the hell you smiling for?
You the Martha Stewart of prison?

01:12:42.752 --> 01:12:43.980
No.

01:12:44.187 --> 01:12:45.779
I'm T.T.

01:12:45.989 --> 01:12:47.718
- You're who?
- I'm T.T.

01:12:48.258 --> 01:12:51.489
- Like two of these?
- I'm T.T.

01:12:52.462 --> 01:12:54.589
Oh, T.T. T.T., how are you doing?

01:12:54.797 --> 01:12:57.630
I'm Mabel,
but everybody call me Madea. Hello.

01:12:58.134 --> 01:13:00.830
I'm so happy that we're sharing a cell.

01:13:01.104 --> 01:13:04.164
This is your bunk. I made it for you.

01:13:04.374 --> 01:13:06.069
Oh, thank you and I appreciate it.

01:13:06.276 --> 01:13:08.540
I ain't into that.
Because you making a bunk...

01:13:08.745 --> 01:13:12.306
...don't mean I'm giving you nothing.
You ain't getting none of this stuff.

01:13:12.515 --> 01:13:14.915
Put your hands on me I'll punch
that Spanish out.

01:13:15.118 --> 01:13:17.518
You gonna be talking
straight up English.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.880
You're so funny.

01:13:19.088 --> 01:13:20.851
I was just being nice.

01:13:21.057 --> 01:13:23.355
When I saw you come in, I thought:

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.792
"I hope she's in my cell."

01:13:29.632 --> 01:13:32.999
Brownies for my brownie?

01:13:33.203 --> 01:13:34.500
I made them myself.

01:13:34.704 --> 01:13:37.901
"Brownies for your brownie?" You
trying to call me black or something?

01:13:38.107 --> 01:13:39.096
Brownie.

01:13:39.309 --> 01:13:42.005
Ain't no oven in here.
How the hell you make a brownie?

01:13:42.378 --> 01:13:44.676
I have my ways.

01:13:45.148 --> 01:13:46.206
No, thank you.

01:13:48.051 --> 01:13:51.452
I saw you on TV.
That was a great chase.

01:13:51.654 --> 01:13:53.383
How long you have here, my dear?

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:55.319
They tell me I got five years.

01:13:55.525 --> 01:13:57.686
But I'm breaking
out of here first chance I get.

01:13:58.328 --> 01:14:00.626
Can I come with you?

01:14:03.433 --> 01:14:06.402
You seem like a nice, sweet person
The hell you in here for?

01:14:06.603 --> 01:14:09.401
Stealing flowers? What you do?
Steal candy from Girl Scouts?

01:14:09.606 --> 01:14:10.971
What, what?

01:14:12.775 --> 01:14:14.242
No.

01:14:14.444 --> 01:14:16.674
I murdered 18 men.

01:14:16.879 --> 01:14:19.905
- I'm the...
- I'm sorry, you what to 18?

01:14:20.116 --> 01:14:22.983
I murder 18 men.

01:14:23.486 --> 01:14:25.716
- Eighty?
- Eighteen.

01:14:25.922 --> 01:14:28.652
One-eight men.

01:14:32.262 --> 01:14:36.096
I'm one of the first female serial killers.

01:14:36.299 --> 01:14:39.462
I'm going to be here till I... die.

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:44.702
But I'll be making you brownies,
my brownie.

01:14:55.385 --> 01:14:57.080
Hey, which one is yours?

01:14:57.287 --> 01:14:59.517
Oh, you can take either one.

01:15:00.156 --> 01:15:01.680
Donna?

01:15:03.126 --> 01:15:04.718
Candy? Oh, my God.

01:15:04.927 --> 01:15:06.690
Candy.

01:15:07.563 --> 01:15:09.121
- How are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

01:15:09.332 --> 01:15:10.492
I am so glad to see you.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.861
- I know.
- I didn't know what happened to you.

01:15:13.069 --> 01:15:16.095
I've been trying to reach you
but you ain't got no address.

01:15:19.842 --> 01:15:21.036
You look good.

01:15:21.244 --> 01:15:23.769
Yeah, I'm doing good.
How are you doing?

01:15:26.649 --> 01:15:29.914
- What?
- They gave me 17 years.

01:15:30.219 --> 01:15:32.653
- For...? For what?
- Donna...

01:15:32.855 --> 01:15:34.413
...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:38.158
No, that ain't right.
They had to trump your charges.

01:15:38.361 --> 01:15:41.797
I don't know what happened.
I just know this ain't right.

01:15:42.165 --> 01:15:43.757
Donna.

01:15:44.734 --> 01:15:46.929
What am I gonna do
for 17 years in here?

01:15:47.303 --> 01:15:50.238
I've been going to Ellen's services.
No, wait, wait, wait.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.670
She teaches classes here.
You should go.

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:54.433
I ain't trying to be in no church.

01:15:54.644 --> 01:15:56.839
It's not like that.
She teaches a group session.

01:15:57.046 --> 01:15:59.173
And she is really good.

01:15:59.615 --> 01:16:02.311
I mean, she preaches
but not like a preacher, you know.

01:16:02.518 --> 01:16:04.884
She makes it clear
so you can understand it.

01:16:05.088 --> 01:16:07.147
Look at me,
I've been clean all this time.

01:16:07.357 --> 01:16:09.484
And if you take her course...

01:16:09.692 --> 01:16:12.661
...you get time off your sentence.

01:16:13.029 --> 01:16:14.792
You should come.

01:16:16.466 --> 01:16:18.024
I don't know how people eat this.

01:16:18.234 --> 01:16:22.568
This is crazy. I've seen people
on <i>Survivor</i> eat better food than this.

01:16:26.376 --> 01:16:29.209
Doesn't she realize
she was running for some roaches?

01:16:30.279 --> 01:16:31.507
You're a cute little thing.

01:16:31.714 --> 01:16:33.705
- Get your hands off of me.
- Oh, you feisty.

01:16:33.916 --> 01:16:36.510
- Leave her. That's my friend.
- Is anybody talking to you?

01:16:37.053 --> 01:16:38.520
Young man.

01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:43.552
This little lady don't wanna be
bothered, now get on up...

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.058
...go on back to where you came from.
Now, go on.

01:16:46.262 --> 01:16:48.196
Who you think you talking to,
old lady?

01:16:52.702 --> 01:16:55.694
You don't know me. I'm gonna
give you the benefit of the doubt.

01:16:55.905 --> 01:16:58.601
Now, get the hell up from the table
and go on now.

01:16:58.808 --> 01:17:00.503
Go on, go on, sir, go on.

01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:03.042
I see nobody told you I run this prison.

01:17:03.246 --> 01:17:08.240
I'm Big Sal and what Big Sal wants,
Big Sal gets. Get it?

01:17:08.618 --> 01:17:11.052
I guess nobody told you
that I'm Madea.

01:17:11.254 --> 01:17:14.849
Ma to the damn D, E, A,
you understand that?

01:17:15.057 --> 01:17:18.720
And what I want, I get.
Do you understand me?

01:17:18.928 --> 01:17:19.986
I'm from the west end...

01:17:20.196 --> 01:17:23.427
...where we cut a fool first and
run like hell afterwards, understand?

01:17:23.633 --> 01:17:27.091
You don't know me. You don't know
who the hell you talking to.

01:17:27.303 --> 01:17:30.170
I'm gonna come across this table
and rip out your urethra tube.

01:17:30.773 --> 01:17:32.263
I see I have to break you in.

01:17:32.475 --> 01:17:33.999
You gonna get broke the hell in...

01:17:39.115 --> 01:17:40.878
- We'll have our time.
- Yes, we will.

01:17:41.083 --> 01:17:43.074
I look forward to it.

01:17:43.653 --> 01:17:45.120
A officer and a gentleman.

01:17:46.956 --> 01:17:50.949
Yeah, get the hell on out of here
with Alvin and the two chipmunks.

01:17:51.961 --> 01:17:53.519
- What the hell is that?
- Thank you.

01:17:53.729 --> 01:17:58.063
I wasn't doing nothing for you. I don't
like people messing over nobody.

01:17:59.101 --> 01:18:01.899
I'm Terry but everybody
calls me T.T.

01:18:03.973 --> 01:18:07.306
She say her name's T.T.
I thought she said titty too at first.

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:09.637
I can't understand
what the hell she's saying.

01:18:09.846 --> 01:18:11.871
Yeah, I'm Candace.

01:18:12.081 --> 01:18:14.777
And I'm Donna. Thank you
for sticking up for my friend.

01:18:14.984 --> 01:18:16.076
Yeah, y'all welcome.

01:18:21.491 --> 01:18:23.288
You have a letter.

01:18:28.431 --> 01:18:31.730
- Why won't you talk to him?
- I ain't got nothing to say to him.

01:18:31.934 --> 01:18:34.630
Maybe he can help figure out
why you're in here so long.

01:18:34.837 --> 01:18:36.498
Listen, I don't wanna talk to him.

01:18:36.706 --> 01:18:39.072
Well, obviously
that man wants to be there for you.

01:18:39.275 --> 01:18:41.641
So why don't you let...
Why don't you just see him?

01:18:41.844 --> 01:18:43.835
Why don't you just drop it?

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.914
Drop it. Yeah, all right.

01:18:49.919 --> 01:18:51.648
They ain't gonna give me five years...

01:18:51.854 --> 01:18:54.254
...Judge Mathis,
I don't care if it's Judge Judy.

01:18:54.457 --> 01:18:56.482
You ain't gonna give me no five years.

01:18:56.692 --> 01:18:59.718
But they did. But I've been
looking for a way to break out of here.

01:18:59.929 --> 01:19:01.988
You folks don't know me.
I will set it all up.

01:19:02.198 --> 01:19:03.426
Hi, sweetness.

01:19:07.169 --> 01:19:08.363
You looking good.

01:19:08.738 --> 01:19:11.502
I know you ain't talking to me.
She must be talking to you.

01:19:11.707 --> 01:19:15.143
I'm ain't gonna let her
take my virginity.

01:19:16.212 --> 01:19:17.975
- What's so funny?
- You funny.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:20.774
You funny as hell
looking like Lou Ferrigno.

01:19:21.684 --> 01:19:23.515
Old lady,
you know who you're talking to.

01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:27.485
Yes, I do. I'm talking to you. You better
back the hell up out my face...

01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:30.250
- Well, leave it alone.
- Go ahead on, bruh. Go ahead on.

01:19:30.459 --> 01:19:32.450
Go ahead on.
Y'all tell him, he don't know.

01:19:33.563 --> 01:19:35.360
So when are you coming to see me?

01:19:36.933 --> 01:19:38.867
Young man.

01:19:39.168 --> 01:19:41.830
Didn't this girl tell you
she don't want to be bothered?

01:19:42.038 --> 01:19:45.405
Why the hell do you keep talking
to her? What is wrong with you?

01:19:45.608 --> 01:19:47.132
What you gonna do?

01:19:52.848 --> 01:19:54.179
What you...

01:19:54.383 --> 01:19:56.180
...gonna do?
That's what I wanna know.

01:19:56.385 --> 01:19:59.479
What you gonna do? You gonna
sit there and tell something to me.

01:19:59.689 --> 01:20:02.089
- Would you stop it.
- Say something, say something.

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:04.452
- I don't hear you.
- I'll get you for this...

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.061
...grandma.
- What's going on, big woman?

01:20:08.264 --> 01:20:09.458
Come on, you big papa...

01:20:09.665 --> 01:20:11.030
Come on, up in there.

01:20:11.233 --> 01:20:13.201
Oh, yeah.

01:20:17.206 --> 01:20:18.730
Cover up him.

01:20:19.976 --> 01:20:21.341
What's going on in here?

01:20:22.178 --> 01:20:23.611
We not doing nothing.

01:20:30.553 --> 01:20:33.488
I'm just telling her how good God is.

01:20:36.258 --> 01:20:38.123
All right, today...

01:20:38.327 --> 01:20:40.693
...we are gonna talk about forgiveness.

01:20:40.896 --> 01:20:43.228
Why is this so important? Yes, T.T.

01:20:43.899 --> 01:20:46.663
Because you have to forgive
to be forgiven.

01:20:46.869 --> 01:20:47.858
Correct.

01:20:48.204 --> 01:20:51.367
We must forgive others
as Christ forgave us.

01:20:51.774 --> 01:20:54.538
Last week we talked
about the first steps to forgiveness.

01:20:54.744 --> 01:20:55.972
Anybody know?

01:20:57.346 --> 01:20:59.007
Acknowledging what was done.

01:20:59.215 --> 01:21:00.842
That's right.

01:21:01.484 --> 01:21:04.282
A lot of times we don't wanna
acknowledge what we've done.

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:09.887
When you don't forgive somebody,
you give them power over your life.

01:21:10.092 --> 01:21:12.856
They're sleeping at night
and you're walking around...

01:21:13.062 --> 01:21:15.587
...remembering everything
that they've done.

01:21:15.798 --> 01:21:17.629
You know a little bit of my testimony.

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:21.496
Sixteen years living on the street.
Drug addiction, prostitution.

01:21:21.704 --> 01:21:24.264
And I did it
because I was hurting myself.

01:21:24.473 --> 01:21:27.465
I was hurting my daddy.
I was hurting my mother.

01:21:27.677 --> 01:21:31.306
I was hurting every man
that did anything bad to me.

01:21:31.514 --> 01:21:34.415
Until one day, the Lord spoke to me.

01:21:36.218 --> 01:21:38.152
And he said:

01:21:38.354 --> 01:21:41.790
"Forgiveness
is not for the other person.

01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:43.849
It's for you."

01:21:44.293 --> 01:21:45.783
The longer you hold on to it...

01:21:45.995 --> 01:21:49.522
...the longer you hold on
to the pain and the past and the hurt...

01:21:49.965 --> 01:21:52.365
...the longer you hold yourself back
from being free.

01:21:52.568 --> 01:21:54.593
I can't forgive my dad
for what he did to me.

01:21:54.804 --> 01:21:58.069
- He's the reason I'm in here.
- Well, cookie, don't forgive him.

01:21:58.274 --> 01:22:00.708
Because he's living his life,
you're in here.

01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:03.777
Forgiveness is not for them.
It is for you.

01:22:03.979 --> 01:22:06.709
Well, I can't forgive him.
You don't know what he did to me.

01:22:06.916 --> 01:22:09.749
Lord, do I have to listen
to all this melodrama?

01:22:09.985 --> 01:22:11.612
Is something wrong, Ms. Simmons?

01:22:13.756 --> 01:22:14.950
Is there something wrong?

01:22:15.157 --> 01:22:18.524
Sorry, reverend, doctor, bishop,
preacher lady, whatever your name is.

01:22:18.728 --> 01:22:20.286
I don't agree with all of this.

01:22:20.496 --> 01:22:23.556
I hear what you say about forgiveness.
You're supposed to forgive.

01:22:23.766 --> 01:22:25.631
This child is telling
what her daddy did.

01:22:25.835 --> 01:22:29.032
Your dad is somewhere
living his life and you're on lockdown.

01:22:29.238 --> 01:22:31.035
You're in jail
because of what you did.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.767
Learn how to take some responsibility
for yourself. For your own stuff.

01:22:34.977 --> 01:22:38.811
I can't stand folks wanna be the victim.
"This person did this so I'm this way."

01:22:39.014 --> 01:22:40.208
Everybody got a story.

01:22:40.416 --> 01:22:42.008
Your mama and daddy
gave you life.

01:22:42.218 --> 01:22:45.210
That's all they do. No matter
how good, how bad the life was...

01:22:45.421 --> 01:22:49.448
...it's up to you to make something of it.
Suck it up and shut the hell up.

01:22:49.692 --> 01:22:51.819
- But you don't know what he did.
- Let her talk.

01:22:55.598 --> 01:22:57.190
Thank you, Biggie Smalls.

01:22:57.967 --> 01:22:59.696
I love it when you call me
"big papa."

01:23:00.302 --> 01:23:01.769
You're such a gentleman.

01:23:04.306 --> 01:23:06.206
They say I come here,
I get some time off.

01:23:06.408 --> 01:23:08.205
I'm trying to get time off. Do my time.

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:11.504
I don't mess with nobody.
I don't want nobody to mess with me.

01:23:11.714 --> 01:23:15.275
People, all you up in here
need to understand something, okay?

01:23:15.484 --> 01:23:16.712
Everybody got a life.

01:23:16.919 --> 01:23:18.750
What you do with that life is up to you.

01:23:18.954 --> 01:23:20.819
Stop being the victim. That's all I say.

01:23:21.023 --> 01:23:23.423
I don't preach that stuff.
I will leave that to you.

01:23:23.626 --> 01:23:24.957
I don't even wanna be here.

01:23:25.161 --> 01:23:28.494
But I got to get out of here
because this is working on my damn...

01:23:28.697 --> 01:23:31.461
This is working on my nerves.
Sorry, girls, that's what...

01:23:31.667 --> 01:23:33.897
I can't be bothered with this. You...

01:23:34.503 --> 01:23:36.300
Guess she told you.

01:25:07.396 --> 01:25:11.298
I'm glad you decided
to let me come see you.

01:25:12.902 --> 01:25:14.494
Yeah.

01:25:15.771 --> 01:25:17.068
So how are you?

01:25:18.307 --> 01:25:20.207
I'm making it.

01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:24.907
- So you're getting married soon, huh?
- Yeah.

01:25:26.415 --> 01:25:28.042
Congratulations.

01:25:28.584 --> 01:25:30.449
Good luck with that.

01:25:30.753 --> 01:25:32.983
I really don't know what to say.

01:25:33.188 --> 01:25:36.055
I feel like I keep letting you down.

01:25:36.725 --> 01:25:38.556
I've been going to Ellen.

01:25:38.761 --> 01:25:42.356
And I've really been listening
to what she has to say.

01:25:42.564 --> 01:25:45.499
And she says that
if you love the Lord...

01:25:45.701 --> 01:25:49.398
...then everything is gonna work out
for good for you. Do you believe that?

01:25:50.539 --> 01:25:53.064
Yeah. Yeah, I believe that.

01:25:53.275 --> 01:25:55.505
I know I do because...

01:25:55.945 --> 01:25:57.674
Josh, I gotta believe in something.

01:25:58.047 --> 01:25:59.674
You can believe in me.

01:26:00.115 --> 01:26:02.413
I know I wasn't there that night.

01:26:02.618 --> 01:26:05.052
But I guarantee you
that will never happen again.

01:26:09.725 --> 01:26:13.024
Did you know that they were gonna
do that to me that night?

01:26:17.166 --> 01:26:20.795
Did you know that they were gonna
do that to me that night?

01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:23.229
No, Candy, I didn't.

01:26:23.439 --> 01:26:24.872
Josh, I needed you.

01:26:25.207 --> 01:26:27.368
You weren't there for me.

01:26:27.576 --> 01:26:30.739
You weren't there. I screamed for you.

01:26:32.314 --> 01:26:35.078
And you never came for me.
You left me there.

01:26:35.284 --> 01:26:36.273
Candy.

01:26:36.485 --> 01:26:38.851
You didn't protect me.

01:26:40.155 --> 01:26:41.713
Candy, I'm sorry.

01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:44.653
Please, forgive me.

01:26:46.261 --> 01:26:47.489
Please.

01:26:47.696 --> 01:26:50.324
I was so mad at you, Josh.

01:26:50.532 --> 01:26:52.932
I was so angry for so long.

01:26:55.137 --> 01:26:56.968
But, Josh...

01:26:57.439 --> 01:26:59.464
...I forgive you.

01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:01.805
I forgive you.

01:27:02.011 --> 01:27:04.673
You gotta go on
and you gotta live your life.

01:27:05.547 --> 01:27:07.174
And I gotta live mine.

01:27:07.383 --> 01:27:09.977
I'm not gonna be a victim anymore.

01:27:10.185 --> 01:27:13.621
I gotta change my life for me.
Now you go get married.

01:27:14.089 --> 01:27:15.454
Be happy.

01:27:15.657 --> 01:27:18.125
And I'm gonna try
to do the same thing.

01:27:24.933 --> 01:27:26.161
I gotta go.

01:27:28.037 --> 01:27:30.437
Have a good wedding day.

01:27:45.421 --> 01:27:47.321
Joshua. Joshua.

01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:49.013
Why are you not dressed?

01:27:49.224 --> 01:27:50.486
Get the jacket on.

01:27:50.692 --> 01:27:53.786
Linda's gonna be here, and I'm not
getting cussed out behind you.

01:27:53.996 --> 01:27:56.624
Get your jacket on.
The mayor and the governor are there.

01:27:56.832 --> 01:27:57.992
You gonna make them wait?

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.828
You're gonna keep working?
Look at me like I'm stupid?

01:28:01.036 --> 01:28:03.937
- I will be out there. Thank you.
- Thank you, Josh

01:28:04.139 --> 01:28:07.108
- Thanks a lot. Nice. Nice.
- Calm down. I got it. I got it.

01:28:08.444 --> 01:28:10.173
- Josh, what are you doing?
- Hey.

01:28:10.379 --> 01:28:12.176
It's your wedding,
why are you working?

01:28:12.381 --> 01:28:14.349
- Get dressed.
- I'm getting dressed, man.

01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:17.144
I'm getting dressed.
Yeah, you're right.

01:28:20.255 --> 01:28:21.313
Hey.

01:28:21.523 --> 01:28:22.922
I was looking at...

01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:26.822
I was looking at Candy's file. And...

01:28:29.031 --> 01:28:30.225
Something's not adding up.

01:28:30.699 --> 01:28:33.998
The girl gets 17 years, right?

01:28:34.203 --> 01:28:38.139
And the maximum
on this count is four.

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.248
Josh, I gotta tell you something.

01:29:21.617 --> 01:29:23.983
The couple has written
their own vows.

01:29:24.186 --> 01:29:26.051
These vows are from the heart.

01:29:26.255 --> 01:29:29.224
And will bind them together forever.

01:29:30.926 --> 01:29:32.655
Josh.

01:29:32.861 --> 01:29:35.853
You are my heart and soul.

01:29:36.665 --> 01:29:38.963
I thank God for you every day.

01:29:39.168 --> 01:29:42.569
I promise to love you
in sickness and in health.

01:29:44.072 --> 01:29:47.269
I promise to give myself only to you.

01:29:48.043 --> 01:29:51.012
And I promise to be honest...

01:29:51.914 --> 01:29:55.111
...and to love you forever and ever.

01:29:57.519 --> 01:29:58.747
Linda...

01:29:59.321 --> 01:30:03.781
...I will always know
that you are a wonderful woman.

01:30:05.194 --> 01:30:07.628
But you are a conniving...

01:30:07.829 --> 01:30:10.662
...and a manipulating human being...

01:30:10.866 --> 01:30:12.458
...and you disgust me.

01:30:15.737 --> 01:30:16.761
Joshua.

01:30:19.608 --> 01:30:20.802
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:23.678
This beautiful insecure woman...

01:30:23.879 --> 01:30:25.847
...that I refuse to marry...

01:30:26.048 --> 01:30:30.314
...she padded charges
on a case that she handled...

01:30:30.519 --> 01:30:34.683
...sending somebody to jail
for time that they did not deserve.

01:30:45.701 --> 01:30:47.362
Thank you.

01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:12.427
- What are you doing here? You're...
- Hey, Candy, Candy. Come here.

01:31:12.628 --> 01:31:14.220
Come here.

01:31:15.063 --> 01:31:16.052
No touching.

01:31:16.265 --> 01:31:17.425
Shut up, man.

01:31:17.633 --> 01:31:18.827
What are you doing?

01:31:19.034 --> 01:31:20.695
I gotta get you out of here, okay?

01:31:20.902 --> 01:31:23.700
I gotta get you out. Gotta take
you home. You understand me?

01:31:24.139 --> 01:31:26.733
- What are you talking about?
- I'm gonna get you out.

01:31:26.942 --> 01:31:30.207
Linda is the last person in my life
that I'm gonna let hurt you.

01:31:30.412 --> 01:31:31.572
I'm gonna be here for you.

01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:35.113
I'll help you kick that crap
in the streets and all the other stuff...

01:31:35.317 --> 01:31:37.683
...if it takes every breath in my body.
Understand?

01:31:38.954 --> 01:31:40.251
I love you.

01:31:46.228 --> 01:31:47.695
No touching.

01:31:49.164 --> 01:31:50.859
The heck with it.

01:32:08.150 --> 01:32:11.313
<i>It's a public issue because justice</i>
<i>is for everyone. God bless you.</i>

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.987
You're on with Frank and Wanda.

01:32:13.188 --> 01:32:15.520
<i>When I was reviewing</i>
<i>Candace Washington's file...</i>

01:32:15.724 --> 01:32:17.885
<i>... I discovered Linda Davis</i>
<i>tried both women...</i>

01:32:18.093 --> 01:32:20.357
<i>Judges who presided</i>
<i>over each case gave...</i>

01:32:20.562 --> 01:32:23.326
<i>The goal of the district attorney's</i>
<i>office is to see that...</i>

01:32:23.532 --> 01:32:27.298
<i>... these seven unjustly imprisoned</i>
<i>women be released immediately...</i>

01:32:27.502 --> 01:32:29.470
<i>... and be reunited</i>
<i>with their loved ones.</i>

01:32:29.671 --> 01:32:33.266
<i>And it's the</i> Tom Joyner Morning Show.
<i>This morning I am outraged.</i>

01:32:33.475 --> 01:32:38.310
<i>I am outraged about this prosecutor</i>
<i>that has got Madea in there.</i>

01:32:38.513 --> 01:32:40.845
<i>This story is so unbelievable to me.</i>

01:32:41.049 --> 01:32:42.812
<i>Reverend Al Sharpton. We're back.</i>

01:32:43.018 --> 01:32:45.384
I wanna talk about this hotshot
district attorney...

01:32:45.587 --> 01:32:47.452
...that's trying to build up a career...

01:32:47.656 --> 01:32:49.521
- <i>... trumping up charges.</i>
- <i>Michael Baisden.</i>

01:32:49.725 --> 01:32:53.684
<i>First, the Jena Six, now the Georgia</i>
<i>Seven, which includes Madea.</i>

01:32:53.895 --> 01:32:57.228
<i>An elderly woman sentenced</i>
<i>for five years for a victimless crime.</i>

01:32:57.432 --> 01:32:59.992
- <i>Know how we do</i> it...
- <i>Seventeen minutes after the hour.</i>

01:33:00.202 --> 01:33:02.693
<i>Welcome back to the ride.</i>
Steve Harvey Morning Show.

01:33:02.904 --> 01:33:05.930
<i>Call us because Madea</i>
<i>deserves to be freed.</i>

01:33:06.141 --> 01:33:09.975
<i>And march down to the DA 's office</i>
<i>and get this accomplished.</i>

01:33:16.184 --> 01:33:17.674
We are back now.

01:33:17.886 --> 01:33:23.017
Mabel Simmons, also known
to the general population as Madea...

01:33:23.225 --> 01:33:26.888
...has been arrested and there's been
yet another "Free Madea" rally.

01:33:27.095 --> 01:33:28.357
Now, come on.

01:33:28.563 --> 01:33:30.690
Okay, she carries a gun. Like carrying.

01:33:30.899 --> 01:33:32.196
But she has to carry a gun.

01:33:32.401 --> 01:33:34.801
She's a vulnerable older black woman.

01:33:35.003 --> 01:33:36.698
Madea is not vulnerable.

01:33:36.905 --> 01:33:37.894
That's how I see it.

01:33:38.106 --> 01:33:40.904
We have a right to carry our guns.
It's in our constitution.

01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:45.170
She bares all those arms. She got
guns, she's just cutting people down.

01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:46.813
And she was not the only one.

01:33:47.015 --> 01:33:50.041
<i>You put six, seven women in jail</i>
<i>with these kind of sentences.</i>

01:33:50.252 --> 01:33:52.686
<i>Is this the kind of justice</i>
<i>we're looking for?</i>

01:33:52.888 --> 01:33:53.786
<i>We have a news alert.</i>

01:33:53.955 --> 01:33:56.185
<i>I'm in front</i>
<i>of the Georgia State Courthouse...</i>

01:33:56.391 --> 01:33:58.723
<i>... where Assistant District Attorney</i>
<i>Linda Davis...</i>

01:33:58.927 --> 01:34:01.327
<i>... was indicted today</i>
<i>by a grand jury.</i>

01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:04.966
<i>The charges include fraud, tampering,</i>
<i>and providing false documents.</i>

01:34:05.167 --> 01:34:06.828
I wish that chick had tried my case.

01:34:07.035 --> 01:34:08.730
<i>At some point maybe today...</i>

01:34:08.937 --> 01:34:11.303
<i>... maybe tomorrow,</i>
<i>but at some point soon...</i>

01:34:11.506 --> 01:34:15.272
<i>... Linda Davis will have</i>
<i>to turn herself in to the authorities...</i>

01:34:15.477 --> 01:34:17.570
<i>... and she will be</i>
<i>officially processed.</i>

01:34:17.779 --> 01:34:18.837
<i>What does that mean?</i>

01:34:19.047 --> 01:34:20.844
<i>That means she will be</i>
<i>fingerprinted...</i>

01:34:21.049 --> 01:34:24.712
<i>... and at some point she will stand</i>
<i>against the wall of shame...</i>

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.911
<i>... and have her mugshot taken.</i>

01:34:27.122 --> 01:34:29.682
<i>What a fall from grace</i>
<i>for Linda Davis.</i>

01:34:29.891 --> 01:34:30.880
Hey, turn the TV on.

01:34:31.092 --> 01:34:33.617
We sitting looking at that.
What's wrong with you?

01:34:33.829 --> 01:34:34.818
Bernice Davis...

01:34:35.263 --> 01:34:36.730
...lda Mae Jones...

01:34:36.932 --> 01:34:37.921
...Takeda Matthews...

01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:39.800
...Andrea Thomas...

01:34:40.001 --> 01:34:41.195
...Candace Collins...

01:34:41.403 --> 01:34:42.768
...Mabel Simmons...

01:34:42.971 --> 01:34:44.563
...and Elizabeth Bryant.

01:34:44.773 --> 01:34:47.071
There's been an investigation
in the DA's office...

01:34:47.275 --> 01:34:49.766
...that has led
to the overturning of your convictions.

01:34:49.978 --> 01:34:52.947
Get your things. You're going home.

01:34:53.148 --> 01:34:54.581
What?

01:34:55.617 --> 01:34:57.778
Group hug.

01:35:03.592 --> 01:35:05.059
Do you feel justice was served?

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.194
Yeah, justice is served.

01:35:07.395 --> 01:35:10.796
You know, justice with...
Brian knows about the justice.

01:35:10.999 --> 01:35:15.834
I just think that we all are really happy
that justice has been overturned.

01:35:16.037 --> 01:35:19.495
And you know what? I'm gonna go
buy her a white dress with a white hat.

01:35:19.708 --> 01:35:23.576
White ruffle pants, white ruffle socks
and shoes. Going to Church this time.

01:35:23.778 --> 01:35:26.076
The person to ask is Madea.
Here she comes now.

01:35:33.722 --> 01:35:35.656
Soldier boy.

01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:39.990
I've nothing to say.
I've nothing to say.

01:35:40.195 --> 01:35:42.686
It's just been really tough
being up in that prison.

01:35:42.898 --> 01:35:47.164
They did all this stuff to try to get me
down but do... You can't keep me down.

01:35:47.369 --> 01:35:50.031
Praise the Lord. God bless you.
Hallelujah.

01:36:23.004 --> 01:36:24.869
They tell me you're the best.

01:36:25.073 --> 01:36:26.904
Well, look, I don't usually do this.

01:36:27.108 --> 01:36:30.373
I mean, you need to know that.
I don't usually see people individually.

01:36:30.579 --> 01:36:34.538
I saw the videotape of you
getting arrested and I thought...

01:36:34.749 --> 01:36:36.148
...I've got to see this woman.

01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:40.879
- You can't think what you did was okay.
- You don't know what happened.

01:36:41.089 --> 01:36:45.617
What do you mean? I saw it on tape.
I saw you forklift the lady's car...

01:36:45.827 --> 01:36:48.557
...out of a parking space.
- You're talking about that time.

01:36:48.763 --> 01:36:50.754
I ain't know what you talking about.

01:36:50.966 --> 01:36:52.627
Oh, they had that on video too?

01:36:52.834 --> 01:36:55.928
Know what, that woman just...
I've been riding by that parking lot...

01:36:56.137 --> 01:36:59.197
...my air conditioner don't work
in my Cadillac, that '78 Cadillac.

01:36:59.407 --> 01:37:02.638
And I was driving around
and could not get a parking spot.

01:37:02.844 --> 01:37:05.813
There she was, zoomed in there,
knew I was waiting for that spot.

01:37:06.014 --> 01:37:09.541
- What else was I supposed to do?
- Well, you go on to another space.

01:37:09.751 --> 01:37:11.946
Do you have to be in control
all the time?

01:37:12.988 --> 01:37:14.785
No, I don't have to be in control.

01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:17.686
That was my parking spot.
I wasn't going to another space.

01:37:17.892 --> 01:37:20.417
That was the closest to the door.
That's the one I want.

01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:23.223
Other people want stuff too.
It's not just about you.

01:37:23.431 --> 01:37:25.422
It's not just about you all the time.

01:37:25.634 --> 01:37:27.124
In my world, it's about me.

01:37:27.335 --> 01:37:29.929
This is Madea's world.
It's about me, Dr. Phil.

01:37:30.138 --> 01:37:32.231
Do you get angry
when you feel out of control?

01:37:32.574 --> 01:37:35.907
I'm never angry. I keep telling people
I am not angry, okay?

01:37:36.111 --> 01:37:38.079
Somebody do something to me,
I do something.

01:37:38.279 --> 01:37:40.144
You don't bother me,
I don't bother you.

01:37:40.348 --> 01:37:42.680
You weren't angry when you
flipped over this car?

01:37:42.884 --> 01:37:44.442
I was calm and cool as a cucumber.

01:37:44.653 --> 01:37:47.247
- I was sitting there smoking a cigarette.
- Are you crazy?

01:37:47.455 --> 01:37:48.513
A little bit.

01:37:48.723 --> 01:37:50.953
- I got a question for you.
- I got a question too.

01:37:51.159 --> 01:37:53.650
- What about your childhood?
- What about your childhood?

01:37:53.862 --> 01:37:56.456
Talking about my childhood
is not gonna help your anger.

01:37:56.665 --> 01:37:57.996
I keep saying I'm not angry.

01:37:58.199 --> 01:38:01.566
- But you keep insisting I am.
- Are you happy to be talking to me?

01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:05.069
I would much rather be at the casino
playing blackjack or something.

01:38:05.273 --> 01:38:06.865
But they told me I have to see you.

01:38:07.075 --> 01:38:08.064
- So I'm here.
- Why?

01:38:08.276 --> 01:38:09.641
Because the court made me.

01:38:09.844 --> 01:38:13.507
You forklift a woman's car
out of the parking lot.

01:38:13.715 --> 01:38:15.342
Does that seem reasonable to you?

01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:17.074
She took the parking spot.

01:38:17.852 --> 01:38:20.446
- It isn't your parking spot.
- Yes, it was.

01:38:20.655 --> 01:38:22.384
Did it have your name on it?

01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:24.319
Did it have your name on it?

01:38:24.826 --> 01:38:27.124
It had handicap.
That matches what I had in my car.

01:38:27.328 --> 01:38:30.764
She took it with her little convertible
so I lifted it, flipped it.

01:38:31.266 --> 01:38:34.064
Well, yeah, I believe
the handicapped part. I got that.

01:38:34.269 --> 01:38:36.737
What are you trying to say?
Something's wrong with me?

01:38:36.938 --> 01:38:39.372
Did you see me walk in here? I'm fine.

01:38:39.574 --> 01:38:41.599
What are you doing
in the handicapped space?

01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:43.937
Because it was closer to the door.

01:38:45.513 --> 01:38:46.502
What?

01:38:52.687 --> 01:38:53.745
It's closer to the door.

01:38:53.955 --> 01:38:56.355
They always leave the handicap
close to the door.

01:38:56.558 --> 01:38:57.650
That's why I take it.

01:38:57.859 --> 01:39:00.350
Do you feel
like you always have to get even?

01:39:00.895 --> 01:39:03.295
- Hell, yeah.
- Why do you always have to get even?

01:39:03.498 --> 01:39:06.763
Why can't you just let it roll off
like water off a duck's back?

01:39:06.968 --> 01:39:08.492
Because I ain't no damn duck.

01:39:08.803 --> 01:39:10.293
You don't have to attack people.

01:39:10.505 --> 01:39:12.973
Somebody do something to you,
you do something to you.

01:39:13.174 --> 01:39:17.804
The Bible said in second Deutoronomo,
the book of Jericho that:

01:39:18.012 --> 01:39:20.037
"The eye for a tooth,
a tooth for the people.

01:39:20.248 --> 01:39:22.079
If everybody got the eye,
punch them in it."

01:39:23.651 --> 01:39:26.711
- What?
- I can tell you don't read the Bible.

01:39:26.921 --> 01:39:28.582
Bible say, "Turn the other cheek."

01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:31.554
Somebody hit that cheek,
turn the other. You have two cheeks.

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:34.422
How many you gonna let them hit
before you whup their ass?

01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:36.494
I don't think
you have to whup their ass.

01:39:36.698 --> 01:39:37.960
It ain't about ass-whupping.

01:39:38.166 --> 01:39:41.067
You don't open up a can of whupass
on everybody that you meet.

01:39:41.269 --> 01:39:43.100
- You go with the flow.
- What do you mean?

01:39:43.304 --> 01:39:45.772
Letting people walk over you
like a doormat?

01:39:45.974 --> 01:39:49.876
No. I've been in this life too long to
let some people just walk all over me.

01:39:50.078 --> 01:39:53.536
- I'm not gonna do that.
- But it's easy for you to get bothered.

01:39:53.748 --> 01:39:56.808
It doesn't take a whole lot
for you to get bothered.

01:39:57.018 --> 01:39:58.178
"No, it doesn't."

01:39:58.386 --> 01:39:59.546
"Yes, it does."

01:39:59.921 --> 01:40:01.445
"I beg to differ."

01:40:02.090 --> 01:40:05.526
- Do you sleep well at night?
- Do you sleep well at night?

01:40:06.594 --> 01:40:09.859
Okay, let's try not to answer a question
with a question, okay?

01:40:10.064 --> 01:40:13.227
If you stop asking questions
I'll stop answering with a question.

01:40:13.434 --> 01:40:15.868
- Can you stop?
- Can you stop?

01:40:17.305 --> 01:40:18.704
Okay, all right. Look, look.

01:40:18.907 --> 01:40:20.568
Are you getting angry, doctor?

01:40:20.775 --> 01:40:21.833
Yeah, I'm getting angry.

01:40:22.043 --> 01:40:24.341
- Answer the question.
- Answer what question?

01:40:24.579 --> 01:40:26.547
This isn't working. This isn't helping.

01:40:26.748 --> 01:40:29.478
I told the judge
I didn't need to come here.

01:40:29.784 --> 01:40:31.615
- But you're here.
- Yes, I am here.

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:34.550
- You're not making any sense.
- You're not making any sense.

01:40:34.756 --> 01:40:37.554
Do you talk to people
like this all the time?

01:40:37.826 --> 01:40:39.191
What? What are they gonna do?

01:40:39.394 --> 01:40:41.453
I'm 6-foot-5,
what the hell are they gonna do?

01:40:41.663 --> 01:40:42.960
Yes, I say what's on my mind.

01:40:43.164 --> 01:40:46.395
Ain't nobody gonna run over me.
I'll say what's on my mind.

01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:47.995
Well, what's on your mind?

01:40:49.237 --> 01:40:50.431
What's on your mind?

01:40:51.439 --> 01:40:53.703
Okay, wh...? Is there...?
What are you, a parrot?

01:40:53.908 --> 01:40:55.034
Is there an echo in here?

01:40:55.243 --> 01:40:56.835
There's not a parrot, not an echo.

01:40:57.045 --> 01:41:00.640
None of those things are in here.
I'm talking. They told me to see you.

01:41:00.849 --> 01:41:03.579
You're supposed to help me.
I keep telling I'm not angry.

01:41:03.785 --> 01:41:06.151
- You're not angry?
- No, I'm not angry.

01:41:06.354 --> 01:41:09.653
I don't know how many times I have
to tell you I'm not angry, Dr. Phil.

01:41:09.858 --> 01:41:13.589
- How can you tell if you're angry?
- I could tell if I'm angry, if I'm angry.

01:41:13.795 --> 01:41:17.196
- If I was angry I would know I'm angry.
- You don't think you're angry now?

01:41:17.398 --> 01:41:19.423
- No.
- You're yelling, you're screaming.

01:41:19.667 --> 01:41:21.692
- You're yelling.
- You're driving me crazy.

01:41:21.903 --> 01:41:25.134
But you're the doctor.
You're supposed to handle this hell.

01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:27.706
You're a psychologist.
You've studied with the best.

01:41:27.909 --> 01:41:30.139
You been all over the world
learning about people.

01:41:30.345 --> 01:41:33.576
- And you let a little woman upset you.
- They never told me about you.

01:41:33.781 --> 01:41:36.147
I missed that class,
I can tell you for sure.

01:41:36.351 --> 01:41:38.819
I missed the class
where they went over Madea.

01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:43.150
- Right. Madea 101, baby. You learn it.
- Yeah.

01:41:44.225 --> 01:41:47.456
All right, look. We're getting nowhere.
That's enough.

01:41:47.662 --> 01:41:48.924
- Okay.
- Enough, I've had it.

01:41:49.130 --> 01:41:52.122
That's enough. We're out of here.
You're fired.

01:41:52.333 --> 01:41:55.564
Great. Thank you, Dr. Phil Trump.

01:41:57.739 --> 01:42:01.573
- Can we go now? Is it over?
- It's over, yes. You can leave. Please.

01:42:01.776 --> 01:42:04.802
Please tell the judge we had this
session and it was the best one.

01:42:05.146 --> 01:42:07.944
I'm gonna tell the judge
that you would have to get better...

01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:10.140
...to be crazy.

01:42:10.852 --> 01:42:14.288
How the hell do you get better...?

01:42:17.191 --> 01:42:21.992
- Well, I guess that's it then.
- I guess that's it, you can leave.

01:42:21.993 --> 01:42:22.993
