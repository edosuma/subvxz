Get the hell off of me!

37:23.890 --> 37:24.456
Aah!

37:26.226 --> 37:28.826
Well, that is
quite an accessory, Selena.

37:33.599 --> 37:36.300
Buddy!
I'm gonna kill you!

37:36.368 --> 37:38.302
Agh! Aah!

37:38.370 --> 37:39.804
I'm gonna --

37:39.871 --> 37:42.507
I have to be honest.
I didn't see that one coming.

37:51.916 --> 37:53.716
Mmm! There's Buddy's buddies.

37:53.784 --> 37:55.718
How many of those
have you had?

37:55.786 --> 37:58.487
Join me. Come on.
You can borrow one of my suits.

37:58.555 --> 37:59.822
And, Fiona --

37:59.890 --> 38:02.426
underwear...bikini...
What's the difference?

38:02.493 --> 38:03.494
[ Laughs ]

38:03.562 --> 38:04.929
Yeah.
Maybe next time.

38:06.031 --> 38:07.131
And maybe not.

38:07.199 --> 38:08.899
Right now,
why don't you just drink up

38:08.967 --> 38:10.634
and be happy that it's all over.

38:10.702 --> 38:11.702
Yeah?

38:11.770 --> 38:13.270
Selena's gonna be denied bail.

38:13.338 --> 38:14.605
Bocklage is pressing charges --

38:14.672 --> 38:16.940
grand theft, conspiracy,
and murder.

38:17.008 --> 38:20.278
I guess he took that explosion
kind of personally, huh?

38:20.345 --> 38:22.747
And what about
that, uh, Deans guy?

38:22.814 --> 38:24.215
Well, he was a local convict

38:24.282 --> 38:26.183
she was paying
to swap the sword for her,

38:26.251 --> 38:28.085
and when she learned
we were onto her,

38:28.153 --> 38:29.620
she cut him off a little early.

38:29.688 --> 38:30.921
She's facing that charge, too.

38:30.989 --> 38:33.057
I-I can't
thank you guys enough.

38:33.124 --> 38:35.426
I mean, I sleep easy now,
knowing that I've got

38:35.493 --> 38:38.228
a private platoon of
guerrilla warriors at the ready.

38:38.296 --> 38:41.598
Let's try not <i>needing</i>
<i>a "platoon at the ready"</i>

38:41.666 --> 38:43.066
anytime soon, okay?

38:44.969 --> 38:48.204
Oh! Fiona!
Uh, wait a sec.

38:48.272 --> 38:50.673
I almost forgot.

38:50.741 --> 38:52.808
I did this one for ya special.

38:52.876 --> 38:54.510
Buddy couture.
[ chuckles ]

38:54.577 --> 38:56.678
It's the best fake I ever made.

38:56.746 --> 38:58.313
Thank you, Buddy.

38:58.381 --> 39:01.349
I-if you guys ever need me
for <i>anything,</i>

39:01.417 --> 39:03.552
you know where to find me.

39:09.230 --> 39:10.497
This can't be right.

39:10.564 --> 39:12.331
It is, Mike.
Barry checked.

39:12.399 --> 39:13.833
Kendra's money
went through six banks

39:13.900 --> 39:16.001
and four holding companies
in five different countries.

39:16.069 --> 39:17.769
Yeah, and that's just
what we could <i>confirm.</i>

39:17.837 --> 39:19.203
Barry said there's no end in sight,

39:19.271 --> 39:21.305
so, you know, we're not
gonna be following the money

39:21.373 --> 39:22.673
to Kendra's boss anytime soon.

39:22.741 --> 39:24.775
Not many people
would go to this much trouble

39:24.843 --> 39:25.976
to remain anonymous.

39:26.044 --> 39:27.978
People who start wars
for profit might.

39:28.045 --> 39:30.513
So if the money's a dead end,
what's Jesse planning?

39:30.581 --> 39:32.182
We had Barry
wave his magic wand

39:32.250 --> 39:34.851
and make it look like Kendra's
bank account was drained.

39:34.919 --> 39:36.219
Paper trail starts out

39:36.287 --> 39:38.388
in the exact opposite direction
that the cash came in.

39:38.456 --> 39:39.856
I wonder
how she's gonna take it

39:39.924 --> 39:41.758
when she sees
the folks who sent her to Miami

39:41.826 --> 39:43.693
just ripped her off --
probably not well, huh?

39:43.761 --> 39:45.829
Oh, yeah. This is
appointment television, baby.

39:47.465 --> 39:49.333
(Jesse) <i>Yeah, wrap your head</i>
<i>around it, honey.</i>

39:49.400 --> 39:51.034
<i>Look, if you're confused,</i>
<i>just admit it.</i>

39:51.102 --> 39:53.271
<i>I'll r-repeat myself as many</i>
<i>times as you need me to.</i>

39:53.338 --> 39:55.039
(Kendra) <i>[ scoffs ]</i>
<i>You can't be serious!</i>

39:55.107 --> 39:56.306
<i>Oh, I'm</i>
<i>completely serious!</i>

39:56.374 --> 39:58.541
You see that right there?
You see it?

39:58.609 --> 39:59.809
That is a zero.

39:59.876 --> 40:02.711
A zero, as in, your account
has been zeroed out.

40:02.778 --> 40:05.080
<i>This isn't possible!</i>
<i>No one even knew about this account!</i>

40:05.148 --> 40:07.284
<i>Well, obviously,</i>
<i>the people that paid you did!</i>

40:07.352 --> 40:08.619
Think about it.

40:08.687 --> 40:10.788
Whoever sent you to Miami
must have cleaned you out

40:10.855 --> 40:12.223
as soon as we grabbed you.

40:12.291 --> 40:14.192
Probably figured
you wouldn't be needing it.

40:14.260 --> 40:16.294
<i>When you're interrogating</i>
<i>someone with nothing to lose,</i>

40:16.362 --> 40:18.596
<i>you have to give them</i>
<i>another reason to talk.</i>

<i>If you're looking to motivate</i>
<i>someone who's cut off, alone,</i>

40:21.166 --> 40:23.233
<i>and convinced</i>
<i>they're going to die,</i>

40:23.301 --> 40:24.734
<i>you can't beat revenge.</i>

<i>What are you gonna do</i>
<i>from that chair, Kendra, Hmm?</i>

40:33.176 --> 40:34.477
What are you gonna do?

40:37.712 --> 40:40.847
<i>You already know that I came</i>
<i>to Miami to work a contract.</i>

40:40.915 --> 40:42.715
<i>But there wasn't just</i>
<i>one target.</i>

40:42.783 --> 40:45.384
I came to wrap up a big job.
Go on.

40:45.452 --> 40:47.520
<i>Kassar was just</i>
<i>the first part.</i>

40:47.588 --> 40:49.624
There were three other names
on that tape drive,

40:49.692 --> 40:52.728
all operatives hired to rob
a bank -- a safety-deposit box.

40:52.796 --> 40:54.697
But they blew it.
They got caught.

40:54.765 --> 40:56.599
They proved themselves
expendable.

40:56.667 --> 40:58.167
Expendable to who?
Who sent you?

40:59.470 --> 41:01.605
<i>If I knew his name,</i>
<i>I'd tell you, believe me.</i>

41:01.673 --> 41:03.073
But he kept it anonymous.

41:03.141 --> 41:05.643
I don't even know what bank
they were trying to hit.

41:05.711 --> 41:07.979
All I know is, it went down
the 4th of last month.

41:12.651 --> 41:14.653
You promise me one thing.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.122
If this helps you track down
the man that hired me,

41:17.188 --> 41:20.489
you make sure he knows that
I'm the one that ruined him.

41:29.793 --> 41:32.194
Who's the predator
and who's the prey <i>now,</i> mama?

41:32.262 --> 41:33.329
[ Laughter ]

41:33.396 --> 41:34.897
I guess it's time to track down

41:34.964 --> 41:36.731
which bank
they were trying to Rob.

41:36.799 --> 41:38.799
Find the bank, figure out
<i>what</i> they were trying to steal.

41:38.867 --> 41:40.633
Might tell us a lot
about who's behind all this.

41:40.701 --> 41:42.334
All right. What do you
want to do about her?

41:42.402 --> 41:44.436
Well, I faxed her prints
to my guy at the FBI.

41:44.504 --> 41:46.671
She came back with warrants,
so I figured I'd just

41:46.739 --> 41:49.106
make an anonymous donation
to their bad-guy collection.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.841
I will get...
The duct tape.
