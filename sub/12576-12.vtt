WEBVTT

00:32.449 --> 00:34.284
Uh, just my luck.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.411
The Super Bowl party's in ten days

00:36.411 --> 00:39.497
and my television goes
on the disabled list.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.000
Why don't we just get a new TV?

00:42.500 --> 00:44.586
Well, I wish that was possible, son

00:44.586 --> 00:46.337
but the terrible truth is

00:46.421 --> 00:50.258
that America, the best country
in the history of the world

00:50.258 --> 00:52.635
no longer makes television sets.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.765
If I let this one fall apart,
I let a piece of America die.

00:57.348 --> 01:01.186
Well, couldn't we just
buy, like, a Japanese one?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.645
Bobby, go to your room.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.483
Luanne, telephone!

01:06.483 --> 01:07.609
It's Buckley.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.693
Hmm.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.696
Hello, Buckley. What?

01:12.280 --> 01:14.115
Uh, oh... Of course not.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.452
We can go to the outlet stores next week.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.954
It's not like they're having
a sale or anything.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.123
They have everyday low prices.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.669
Why are people so mean, Aunt Peggy?

01:26.753 --> 01:29.214
It's been 2,000 years since Jesus was born

01:29.214 --> 01:31.216
but we're still acting like cavemen.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.342
Oh, honey.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.301
Peggy!

01:33.301 --> 01:35.804
We're going shopping
for the Super Bowl party

01:35.804 --> 01:37.430
not your feminine items.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.140
Diet soda?

01:39.974 --> 01:40.892
Hank...

01:40.892 --> 01:42.727
We have got a situation here.

01:42.811 --> 01:46.272
Luanne has come down
with a bad case of the why me's?

01:46.773 --> 01:49.609
Come on. Just do something to cheer
her up. Please?

01:49.609 --> 01:52.904
Hey, uh, Luanne, me, and Bobby

01:52.904 --> 01:54.823
are heading over to the Megalo Mart.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.116
You want to go for a ride?

01:56.741 --> 01:59.285
Is it okay if I don't feel like talking?

01:59.369 --> 02:00.245
Sure. Why not?

02:02.831 --> 02:04.916
Oh, it's not just Buckley.

02:04.916 --> 02:05.959
It's everything.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.669
The world's going to pieces.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.504
I mean, look at any newspaper.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.297
Aliens are getting autopsies

02:11.381 --> 02:13.466
and devil babies are being born every day.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.845
Well, that may be true, Luanne,
but it's up to each of us

02:16.845 --> 02:19.139
to make the world a better place.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.557
Take me, for example.

02:20.557 --> 02:24.435
I sell a clean-burning,
energy-efficient fuel.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.771
Oh! Do you think I could sell propane?

02:26.855 --> 02:28.857
No.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.150
What I'm saying is

02:30.150 --> 02:32.026
you've got to find your own calling.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.404
Yeah. You're probably right.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.489
You're always probably right.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.993
- Garage sale.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.419
This is it, one deflection coil
made in the US Of A.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.545
With this in our set,

02:50.545 --> 02:52.130
the only thing beyond our control

02:52.255 --> 02:54.174
is the size of the NFC victory.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.595
Why don't we just watch the game
at Mr. Dauterive's house?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.138
I like it there.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.473
He keeps snacks in his couch cushions.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.558
No, Bobby.

03:03.558 --> 03:08.438
The Super Bowl party goes,
Bill, Hank, Dale, Boomhauer.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.647
This is Hank year,

03:09.731 --> 03:11.357
and I want everything to be perfect.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.777
People are still talking
about Super Bowl XXIV.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.613
Boomhauer's dip was so thick

03:16.613 --> 03:20.200
our chips were snapping
like Joe Theismann's birdie leg.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.331
Oh.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.084
My name is Luanne.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.586
What's yours?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.087
"I'm Mr. Cat.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.839
Meow to you do?"

03:36.466 --> 03:38.301
You're pretty good with those.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.929
I used to play with the puppets
all the time

03:40.929 --> 03:42.055
with the social worker.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.474
Hey, uh... How much for the puppets?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.517
You mean it?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.686
Well, if it costs 25 cents

03:48.770 --> 03:50.855
to make you smile, it's a bargain.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.148
Look, Dad.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.191
An old wig!

03:53.733 --> 03:56.110
Bobby, take that off.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.617
I'm not saying it was a miracle,
Reverend Thomason,

04:02.617 --> 04:05.161
but I don't usually trip into boxes.

04:05.662 --> 04:09.791
I think God has a plan for me,
and it involves puppets.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.337
Luanne, I... I like the idea
of a christian puppet show,

04:14.337 --> 04:16.673
but try to see things from my perspective,

04:17.131 --> 04:19.592
as the spiritual leader
of this congregation.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.970
We just laid new carpet
in the activities room.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.264
You put 30 kids in there
and lose their attention...

04:24.264 --> 04:26.474
...fruit punch all over my new carpet.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.810
Oh, please. Just hear me out.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.479
You know how baby Jesus
was born in a manger?

04:33.231 --> 04:36.150
Okay. Baby Jesus was born in a manger.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.819
Now...

04:37.819 --> 04:38.987
What if, Reverend...

04:39.279 --> 04:41.239
What if the barnyard animals

04:41.239 --> 04:44.200
who witnessed the miracle birth
of the son of God...

04:45.159 --> 04:46.703
had a show of their own?

04:46.703 --> 04:47.954
Mm-hmm.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.749
But Jesus only spent
a few days in the manger,

04:52.250 --> 04:53.710
and after Luke 2:16,

04:53.710 --> 04:55.461
there's no mention of the animals.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.546
Are you sure?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.464
Trust me, Luanne.
After he leaves the manger,

04:58.548 --> 05:00.633
the Bible pretty much sticks with Jesus.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.344
Well, oh, maybe that's good.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.680
Because then,
the animals are kind of like us,

05:05.680 --> 05:07.557
they're just waiting
for Jesus to come back.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.726
And in the meantime,

05:10.059 --> 05:12.937
don't you think they'd have
all sorts of crazy adventures?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.733
I call it...

05:16.733 --> 05:19.360
The Manger Babies.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.988
We're headlining next week
in the activities room.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.948
Manger Babies.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.074
How do you like that?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.868
This is going to be a great show, Luanne.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.412
I know. But now I've got
so much work to do.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.789
I have to write a script,
build a puppet theater,

05:31.873 --> 05:33.791
learn to talk without moving my lips.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.293
If you want, you can make a theater

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
out of that old refrigerator box
in the garage.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.963
I keep it pretty clean.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.341
Oh, Uncle Hank.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.092
Thank you.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.553
Hey, who said that?

05:49.807 --> 05:52.018
You're doing a great job, Luanne.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.061
Yup.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.771
- Yup.
- Mm-hmm.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.522
Thanks, guys,

05:56.647 --> 05:58.274
but if you have any suggestions...

06:05.365 --> 06:08.409
For those of you who
missed my sermon this morning,

06:08.493 --> 06:10.995
I'd like to remind you that
spilling anything on a new carpet

06:11.579 --> 06:14.040
is a sin. Now...

06:14.665 --> 06:16.959
Please give a warm welcome
to Miss Luanne Patter.

06:19.587 --> 06:24.967
Once upon a time,
almost 2,000s of years ago

06:25.051 --> 06:27.970
our lord and savior
Jesus Christ was born...

06:29.222 --> 06:30.598
...in a manger,

06:31.265 --> 06:34.185
and in that manger
lived the cutest little animals.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.315
This is their story.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.341
There's obadiah, the donkey.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.135
He says, "eee-yaw!"

07:07.135 --> 07:09.011
Hosea the cat, "meow, meow."

07:09.095 --> 07:11.848
An octopus, too, "gurgle, gurgle."

07:11.848 --> 07:14.392
But let's not forget a very British bird

07:14.392 --> 07:16.352
Sir Reginald Featherbottom III.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.312

07:44.422 --> 07:45.673
sticking out a quarter-inch.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.841
Hank, shush!

07:47.467 --> 07:49.343
Today's episode,

07:49.677 --> 07:51.929
<i>Going to the movies.</i>

07:52.013 --> 07:54.140
Who wants to go to the movies?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.224
Eee-yaw!

07:55.308 --> 07:57.018
I do. Eee-yaw!

07:57.685 --> 07:58.936
Uh-oh.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.523
There's five of us,
and I only have four tickets.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.026
One of us blokes
could sneak in. What, what?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.111
Count me-owt.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.155
Isn't sneaking wrong?

08:09.155 --> 08:12.867
Eee-yaw! Everybody's doing it. Eee-yaw!

08:12.867 --> 08:14.327
Gurgle, gurgle.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.704
Meow-kay. Let's go.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.539
<i>♪ La, la-la, la-la, la-la ♪</i>

08:18.664 --> 08:20.416
<i>♪ We're going to the movies ♪</i>

08:20.500 --> 08:21.792
<i>♪ La, la-la, la-la, la-la... ♪</i>

08:22.293 --> 08:25.379
Yeah, but it reflects poorly
on my craftsmanship.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.547
That's all I'm saying.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.217
Hank, you're the only one who notices.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.141
Here you go.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.143
Four tickets.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.811
"But there are five of you!

08:40.895 --> 08:42.813
You were trying to sneak into the movies!"

08:43.439 --> 08:45.983
You Manger Babies are in
a lot of trouble.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.194
I'm locking you in a closet.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.446
LUANNE (in high-pitched voice): No! No!

08:50.947 --> 08:55.243
And that's why you shouldn't
sneak into the movies.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.787
The end.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.669
The end. The end?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.921
- Mmm...
- But, well...

09:06.921 --> 09:09.423
Well, do they get out of the closet?

09:10.466 --> 09:12.593
Um... Sure. I guess.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.097
How?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.182
How do they get out?

09:19.433 --> 09:20.601
Um...

09:21.936 --> 09:23.729
I'm bored.

09:27.775 --> 09:28.859
I don't understand.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.536
Okay, Luanne.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.330
How do they get out of the closet?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.041
Oh!

09:44.500 --> 09:45.501
No.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.169
That won't work.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.463
Jimmy, the lock with a coat hanger.

09:49.547 --> 09:53.134
What? I don't... I can't... Huh? What?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.760
Jimmy the lock with a...

09:56.137 --> 09:59.682
Uh, I'll save you, Manger Babies.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.641
You will?

10:00.725 --> 10:05.062
Yes, 'cause I'm the assistant manager

10:05.146 --> 10:06.272
of this movie theater.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.609
I sell popcorn and popcorn accessories,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.319
and you are fired.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.238
We're free! We're free!

10:16.157 --> 10:17.116
I knew it.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.951
Thank you, assistant manager.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.288
Meow can we ever repay you?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.707
By never forgetting this lesson,

10:25.041 --> 10:27.293
sneaking into the movies is wrong,

10:27.585 --> 10:30.755
as wrong as spilling juice
on a new carpet.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.090
Bravo! Bravo!

10:33.174 --> 10:34.925
You know, Luanne really shouldn't waste

10:35.009 --> 10:36.969
this kind of talent on church.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.014
If you want, I could show her tape
to my boss at channel 84.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.767
He's always looking for
quality children's programming

10:42.767 --> 10:45.061
and home videos of things blowing up.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.605
Well, Luanne really could use
a boost right now,

10:48.147 --> 10:50.816
but I could not take advantage
of our friendship like that, no.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.111
Oh, Peggy, honey, this is show business.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.488
That's what friends do.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.164
Done. All right, Bobby.
It's safe to plug her back in now.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.293
Uh... Oh, okay.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.796
- Another Super Bowl...

11:11.796 --> 11:13.422
...another can of Scotchguard.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.757
It would be a whole lot simpler

11:14.757 --> 11:16.217
if you would just ask Bill

11:16.217 --> 11:18.344
not to wipe his hands on the cushions.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.845
I got a better idea.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.056
You sit here

11:22.056 --> 11:24.642
Boomhauer, Dale, me,
and Bobby will sit here.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.269
We'll do a zone defense around the chips.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.814
But what if Bill tries scrambling
around the coffee table?

11:29.814 --> 11:32.274
He doesn't have that
kind of quickness, Peggy.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.275
Not anymore.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.027
Uh, Aunt Peggy?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.987
Could you please pull your car
out of the garage?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.823
Me and the babies need to rehearse.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.908
The TV station could call any minute.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.743
They'd be crazy not to.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.496
That was the best dang
Christian puppet show

11:45.496 --> 11:47.415
I have ever seen. Ever.

11:47.415 --> 11:51.210
Well, I couldn't have done it
without your help, Uncle Hank.

11:51.585 --> 11:52.837
You saved the day.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.296
That's why this time,

11:54.630 --> 11:57.133
I wrote a part especially for you.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.926
Well, that's very nice, Luanne,

11:58.926 --> 12:00.928
but my appearance was one night only.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.346
But you got to do it.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.433
Well... Who else am I going
to get to play God?

12:06.183 --> 12:07.435
God?

12:07.435 --> 12:08.352
Sure.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.563
You were great
as the hero of my last show,

12:10.563 --> 12:11.480
so I figured

12:11.981 --> 12:14.400
why not have you play
the greatest hero of them all?

12:14.775 --> 12:16.485
Tell you what, Luanne.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.614
Uh, just as soon as I finish
turning beer into water,

12:20.698 --> 12:21.991
I'll meet you in the garage.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.159
Great!

12:23.993 --> 12:27.455
Huh. She made me God.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.083
Hey. if you're God,
I guess that makes me Jesus.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.251
Bobby, honey.

12:32.251 --> 12:33.669
You really shouldn't say that.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.379
That is for Luanne to decide.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.382
Let there be light...

12:39.300 --> 12:40.634
...and it was good.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.263
Yeah, that's super, Uncle Hank,
but could we get back to the script?

12:44.263 --> 12:47.308
We're at the part
where you meet your archenemy.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.018
Bobby's GI Joe?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.228
Joe six-pack.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.606
He's a drunk driver
who died in a car crash

12:53.606 --> 12:55.232
and was sent to hell!

12:55.316 --> 12:57.401
And then he borrowed
Satan's pickup truck without asking

12:57.485 --> 12:59.111
and trashed it,
so he got kicked out of hell.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.822
And now he roams the earth
riding buses and doing evil,

13:01.906 --> 13:03.657
like he won't call on your birthday,

13:03.741 --> 13:05.367
and he throws beer bottles at your head.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.995
What? He crashed a truck?

13:07.995 --> 13:10.539
You will feel my wrath.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.382
What you throwing out, Grandpa?

13:20.466 --> 13:23.469
The money I poured into the Social
Security System?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.514
It's for Luanne's Puppet show.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.057
I'm playing God.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.184
Well, maybe we ought to ask God

13:30.184 --> 13:31.727
who's going to win the Super Bowl.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.728
Going to win?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.064
The game was pre-taped six months ago

13:35.064 --> 13:36.649
in the same Nevada hangar

13:36.649 --> 13:38.400
where they faked the moon landing.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.611
Yeah, man. It's like that dang old
Capricorn One, man.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.822
A good movie, but you know,
they ain't gonna fake no...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.990
staying on the ground
like that, little dude,

13:45.074 --> 13:46.283
that ol' Neil Armstrong.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.161
Well, I hope you're ready
for that party, Hank.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.538
'Cause you only got...

13:51.872 --> 13:54.875
four more days till the Super Bowl.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.045
Bill, the Super Bowl is in three days.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.089
Aw, damn.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.262
God's not angry on that line.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.388
He's vengeful.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.514
Let's try it again.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.765
Luanne?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.058
It's the TV station.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.396
Hello. Mm-hm.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.148
Oh, Hank. Look how excited she is.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.567
You know, just a few days ago,

14:19.567 --> 14:22.570
she was talking like...
like the world was coming to an end.

14:23.153 --> 14:24.530
You're a good man.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.781
Man?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.242
We did it! We did it!

14:28.242 --> 14:31.912
Channel 84 is putting
"Manger Babies" on the air!

14:31.996 --> 14:36.166
It's UHF, Uncle Hank,
ultra-high frequency.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.293
Oh, Luanne!

14:37.293 --> 14:38.502
You have thrust your hands

14:38.669 --> 14:40.045
into something wonderful this time!

14:40.170 --> 14:41.338
We'd better get back to work.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.465
We've got a whole hour to fill Sunday.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.926
Well, that doesn't give us
much time to get ready.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.429
I mean, Sunday is... Sunday?

14:49.179 --> 14:52.182
Now, is that before
or after the Super Bowl?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.268
During! Can you believe it?

14:54.268 --> 14:57.354
They put us on against the
highest-rated TV event of the year

14:57.438 --> 14:59.481
'cause they know we're the one show
that can beat it.

15:00.441 --> 15:04.111
It's a huge responsibility,
but I know I can do it

15:04.111 --> 15:06.071
with God on my side.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.705
Uncle Hank, I just realized

15:14.705 --> 15:16.874
my octopus only has six legs.

15:16.874 --> 15:19.877
Hmm... If I call him sextapus

15:20.252 --> 15:22.254
do you think I'll offend sensibilities?

15:22.338 --> 15:24.423
Uh, I'm sure you'll figure it out

15:24.423 --> 15:26.008
before super Sunday.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.218
I call it super Sunday

15:28.302 --> 15:32.139
because that's when they play
The Super Bowl... This Sunday.

15:32.806 --> 15:33.933
Mm-hmm.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.810
I guess what I'm trying to say is

15:36.894 --> 15:38.854
I'm going to stay home and watch the game.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.190
What? But you're in my show.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.193
Luanne, the Super Bowl is an event.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.611
We're having a party.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.862
I'm the host.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.572
So, you mean...

15:49.114 --> 15:50.282
you're not coming?

15:52.159 --> 15:55.579
Uh, no, that's not what I said exactly.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.832
I said I'm going
to watch the game, but it could end early

15:58.916 --> 16:02.169
due to injuries
or, uh, a terrorist attack.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.462
Yeah. Who knows?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.219
Don't you think I want to
miss the Super Bowl?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.054
No, sir. I've got enough money
on this game

16:12.054 --> 16:14.598
to cover the bath,
I took on the Dinah Shore Classic,

16:14.890 --> 16:17.059
but I will sit through that puppet show

16:17.059 --> 16:18.811
because Luanne asked me to.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.981
Uh, come on. I'll be God some other time,

16:21.981 --> 16:23.649
like, uh, Easter.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.317
That's during baseball season.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.318
Who cares?

16:26.402 --> 16:29.113
Hank, Luanne believes in you.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.699
How can you allow suffering in her world

16:31.699 --> 16:33.951
when you have the power to prevent it?

16:33.951 --> 16:37.246
Suffering is a part of
every religion, Peggy.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.790
I mean, look at what
the Jews have been through,

16:39.790 --> 16:41.583
and you never hear them complaining.

16:41.667 --> 16:46.672
<i>♪ Home of the... ♪</i>

16:47.297 --> 16:50.342
<i>♪ Brave. ♪</i>

16:51.427 --> 16:54.638
Okay. Who had three minutes
and 40 seconds?

16:54.722 --> 16:55.723
Yo.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.058
Well, goodbye, Hank.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.935
Enjoy the selfish bowl.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.735
Uh, Luanne, I want you to know,

17:08.402 --> 17:10.112
if Uncle Hank lets you down...

17:10.779 --> 17:13.323
Honey, it doesn't mean
that the world is a bad place.

17:13.407 --> 17:14.450
Oh, yes, it does.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.285
Mmm.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.412
Check it out!

17:19.747 --> 17:20.748
Whoo-ee!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.209
Made it to the commercial.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.921
What the hell do Tina Turner's legs

17:28.005 --> 17:29.631
have to do with auto insurance?

17:30.591 --> 17:32.968
- Whoa!

17:33.052 --> 17:34.595
<i>This just in from the Super Bowl:</i>

17:34.595 --> 17:36.805
<i>with 48 seconds left in the first quarter,</i>

17:37.431 --> 17:39.600
<i>it's 63 degrees and partly cloudy.</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:41.727
<i>Now stay tuned for the premiere</i>

17:41.727 --> 17:43.604
<i>of Luanne Platter's</i> Manger Babies.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.105
What are you doing, Hank?

17:45.189 --> 17:47.399
If I wanted to spend Super Bowl Sunday

17:47.483 --> 17:48.484
staring at my wife,

17:48.484 --> 17:50.611
I would've married Fran Tarkenton.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.779
I didn't do anything.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.700
Lord Jesus, please...

17:58.368 --> 17:59.411
Ooh, Uncle...

17:59.828 --> 18:00.704
Oh.

18:01.038 --> 18:05.834
Okay, Luanne,
you're on in five, four, three

18:06.251 --> 18:07.377
two...

18:09.338 --> 18:10.422
Hey, look at that!

18:10.506 --> 18:11.632
He's broken free!

18:11.632 --> 18:12.758
- Yeah!
- Go, go, go!

18:12.758 --> 18:13.801
- Keep going...

18:13.801 --> 18:14.718
<i>♪ The Manger Babies ♪</i>

18:14.802 --> 18:16.553

18:17.179 --> 18:18.555
I didn't change it!

18:19.515 --> 18:22.017
Oh, damn, we missed it!

18:22.101 --> 18:22.935
Well...

18:22.935 --> 18:25.020
At least we get to watch him

18:33.779 --> 18:36.198
- What the hell is this?
- What is this we're watching?

18:36.198 --> 18:40.494
<i>Come on,

18:40.828 --> 18:42.329

18:42.329 --> 18:44.790
<i>God is the designated driver tonight.</i>

18:45.165 --> 18:47.709
<i>God doesn't care about you.</i>

18:47.793 --> 18:49.711
<i>How can you say that?</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:52.047
<i>God does care and he will show it.</i>

18:52.548 --> 18:53.757
Hmm.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.801
This is getting old, Hank.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.927
It's not me!

18:56.927 --> 18:59.429
Uh. It's this darn remote control.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.640
Bill must have dripped crumbs in
it or something.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.565
<i>Maybe God had a flat tire or...</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:11.525
What the hell is going on?

19:11.692 --> 19:13.861
All I know is this is the part
of the movie

19:13.861 --> 19:14.987
where I start thinking

19:14.987 --> 19:17.197
why don't they just get out of the house?

19:17.281 --> 19:19.366
- <i>Don't be an idiot, Luanne.</i>

19:19.366 --> 19:20.868
<i>God's not coming.</i>

19:20.868 --> 19:23.245
He's watching The Super Bowl.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.413
Now, get in.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.125
Eee-yaw! We better do what he says.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.168
Eee-yaw!

19:29.376 --> 19:31.879
Well, he is our only ride.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.174
<i>Luanne, no!</i>

19:35.174 --> 19:36.633
Don't get in the car!

19:39.553 --> 19:40.470
Eee-yaw!

19:40.554 --> 19:44.433
If God doesn't get here soon,
we're all going to die!

19:44.433 --> 19:46.810
Maybe it's best that we do die.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.605
Who wants to live in a world without God?

19:49.605 --> 19:50.731
You're right.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.484
Hey, Joe six-pack, why don't you

19:54.568 --> 19:56.820
just point your car
at those oncoming headlights,

19:56.904 --> 19:58.906
and let's get this thing over with.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.702
Oh, my God!

20:03.702 --> 20:05.579
Yes, I have come.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.666
Oh, thank you, Uncle... Lord.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.835
We never stopped believing in you.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.838
The Manger Babies' faith
has been rewarded.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.840
You are all saved.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.426
Yay!

20:19.426 --> 20:21.845
And as for you, Joe six-pack,

20:21.929 --> 20:25.224
anyone who drinks and drives
is a real jackass.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.267
Eee-yaw! Hey!

20:28.602 --> 20:29.519
Oh...

20:38.362 --> 20:40.364
So, Hank, how does it feel

20:40.364 --> 20:41.531
doing the right thing?

20:41.615 --> 20:43.033
Pretty good, I guess.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.202
Of course, not as good as getting to watch

20:45.202 --> 20:46.912
the end of The Super Bowl.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.539
Ah, the Super Bowl's always a blowout,

20:49.623 --> 20:52.167
this puppet show,
it was a real knuckle-biter.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.670
Oh, my lord, it's Troy Aikman!

20:54.670 --> 20:57.464
What are you doing here, son... Sir?

20:57.464 --> 20:59.591
Well, it's kind of a funny story.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.718
Some guys were snapping towels
in the locker room,

21:01.802 --> 21:04.054
so I went to Bible study
to get some perspective on it,

21:04.054 --> 21:06.098
and I saw a flyer for this puppet show.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.849
Sort of a little miracle, I... I guess.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.477
You know, it was kind of a miracle

21:10.477 --> 21:12.187
that brought me here, too.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.147
You see, I was watching my TV

21:14.231 --> 21:16.316
and it started flipping channels.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.027
Mom, I hope you don't mind
but I borrowed the batteries

21:19.111 --> 21:20.445
from your remote control.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.738
What remote control?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.949
I... I don't have a remote control.

21:23.949 --> 21:25.575
Sure, you do in your purse.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.411
The universal remote that can change

21:27.411 --> 21:29.538
the channel on any brand of television?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.789
I borrowed the batteries

21:30.789 --> 21:32.499
- for my game boy.
- When?

21:32.499 --> 21:34.167
Before the Super Bowl.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.045
But if the remote had no batteries,

21:37.587 --> 21:39.131
how did I...?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.096
Or after The Super Bowl.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.306
I don't remember.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.720
