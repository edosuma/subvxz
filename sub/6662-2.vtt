WEBVTT

00:04.580 --> 00:07.500
My name is Bridget.
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.540 --> 00:10.340
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.920
-We'll protect you.
-You don't get it.

00:12.970 --> 00:15.510
If Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.550 --> 00:19.010
I ran to my sister Siobhan
for help.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.640
Siobhan? Siobhan?

00:20.680 --> 00:23.600
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.860
It was so easy.
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.110
They all think
that I'm her.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.360
Her husband, her lover...

00:31.400 --> 00:33.110
Make a choice,
him or me.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.450
her best friend,
her stepdaughter.

00:35.490 --> 00:37.740
I thought I'd be safe.
Turns out, I was wrong.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.580
You have the wrong girl!

00:41.580 --> 00:44.410
There's a lot about Siobhan's
life I don't know.

00:45.790 --> 00:50.550
[phone ringing]

00:52.590 --> 00:54.170
You've reached
Professor Malcolm Ward.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.260
Please leave a message
at the tone.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.220
[beep]

00:57.260 --> 01:01.060
Malcolm, it's me.
Where are you?

01:01.100 --> 01:04.680
I know I said that we shouldn't
talk. It's just...

01:07.100 --> 01:09.230
I shot someone.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.530
[yelling]

01:12.570 --> 01:15.650
It was self-defense.
He thought that I was Siobhan.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.240
I ran from testifying

01:18.280 --> 01:20.740
because I thought
it was going to be safer.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.660
Well, it's not.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.540
RECORDING: If you are satisfied

01:25.580 --> 01:28.830

What the hell am I doing?

01:30.670 --> 01:32.130

01:32.170 --> 01:33.760
Your message has been deleted.

01:40.930 --> 01:43.180
[grunting]

01:54.820 --> 01:56.780
Damn it.

01:56.820 --> 01:58.490
[door locks rattling]

02:07.120 --> 02:09.540
[door opens and closes]

02:09.580 --> 02:10.790
[footsteps]

02:14.840 --> 02:17.380
Oh, my God.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.770
I told him
to put up sconces,

02:28.810 --> 02:30.520
not knock down
a wall.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.690
What?

02:31.730 --> 02:33.110
The idiot contractor.

02:33.150 --> 02:35.820
Look at this mess.
I'm mortified.

02:37.860 --> 02:40.910
You think maybe it's time
to hire a new contractor?

02:40.950 --> 02:43.990
I do. But it will delay
construction for a few days.

02:44.030 --> 02:47.410
So no one will be here?

02:47.450 --> 02:50.120
No, but in the end I think
it's worth it, don't you?

02:50.170 --> 02:53.500
You're the architect.
You know best.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.590
What?

02:59.630 --> 03:01.380
Nothing. It...

03:01.430 --> 03:03.930
Well, just wondering
what the hold-up was.

03:03.970 --> 03:05.890
You asked me
to meet you here.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.980
I finally
confronted the nanny.

03:16.020 --> 03:18.030
That's why you were late?

03:18.070 --> 03:19.440
You were the one
who thought

03:19.490 --> 03:21.200
she was sleeping
with my husband.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.030
Not that it matters.
We're both wrong.

03:23.070 --> 03:26.280
Her girlfriend informed me
Henry wasn't her type.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.080
Then who is it?

03:30.120 --> 03:33.330
Hell if I know
who he's screwing.

03:35.790 --> 03:39.300
Am I just crazy?

03:39.340 --> 03:41.590
Thanks a lot.

03:42.930 --> 03:45.300
No, I...

03:45.350 --> 03:47.260
Did you ever think

03:47.310 --> 03:49.560
that maybe Henry's
not having an affair?

03:51.600 --> 03:53.560
I-I-I don't know what
to think anymore.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.940
You know, you just need
a good night's sleep.

03:55.980 --> 03:59.320
Yeah, that and
some happy pills.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.780
I'm grabbing a cab.
Are you coming?

04:01.820 --> 04:03.860
Yeah.

04:06.370 --> 04:09.700
Hello? Anyone home?

04:09.740 --> 04:11.500

04:15.710 --> 04:16.960

05:11.060 --> 05:13.020
What message?

05:13.060 --> 05:14.810
Juliet and I had
another fight.

05:14.850 --> 05:15.440
She stormed off.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.230
And now she's not answering
any of her texts.

05:18.270 --> 05:20.520
Got no idea where she is.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.360
What are you doing?

05:22.400 --> 05:26.610
I was, uh, just gathering
up the dry cleaning.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.990
-You OK?
-Uh-huh.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.200
Well, you
don't look it.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.660
Come on, it's late.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.370
It's time for you
to get some rest.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.830
I'm not really
tired, you know.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.670
I was... I was thinking
I might take a walk.

05:41.710 --> 05:44.670
What, at midnight? Pregnant?
I don't think so.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.130
I just wanted
some fresh air.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.340
Well, then go out
on the terrace.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.060
It's not just you
anymore, Siobh.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.020
You have to think
for two now.

05:59.060 --> 06:01.310
I know.

06:01.360 --> 06:06.490
Then please do as you're
told for once, hmm?

06:43.400 --> 06:45.730
Juliet.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.150
Please don't talk.
I have a headache.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.110
Your father's
looking for you.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.410
-You should call him.
-I know.

06:53.450 --> 06:56.490
He texted me
like a hundred times.

07:00.620 --> 07:03.210
You're high.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.630
Was high.

07:04.670 --> 07:07.420
Now I'm hung-over.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.680
Oops.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.340
Hey, watch
what you're doing.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.300
It was an accident.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.720
You don't have to be
such a bitch.

07:16.760 --> 07:20.350
Can I get another beer
and another shot of bourbon?

07:20.390 --> 07:22.520
I think I got to
cut you off, hon.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.860
Whatever.
This place blows.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.150
Ohh...

07:27.190 --> 07:28.610
Sorry.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.450
I'll just get my keys
and I'll be...

07:30.490 --> 07:31.740
-Hey, Bridget.
-What?

07:31.780 --> 07:33.610
You're not driving.
Any volunteers?

07:33.660 --> 07:36.160
Good luck with that.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.450
I don't need your help.

07:38.490 --> 07:41.410
Fine. I'll call my sister.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.460
She's the only one who gives
a crap, anyway.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.670
You want some help?

07:50.720 --> 07:53.090
I want you
to leave me alone.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.930
I can do that.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.100
[door opens and closes]

08:05.060 --> 08:09.070
Do I think high-frequency
trading is dangerous?

08:09.110 --> 08:11.030
I think it's essential.

08:11.070 --> 08:13.200
Computers are
replacing everything.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.030
I'm embracing the technology,

08:15.070 --> 08:16.870
and you should, too.

08:16.910 --> 08:18.990
Oh, my business partner
has just walked in.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.500
Do you want to finish
this up over lunch?

08:23.460 --> 08:26.710
Great. See you then.

08:26.750 --> 08:29.500
What are you doing
in my office?

08:29.550 --> 08:31.630
I'm looking for that list
of algo traders.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.590
Oh, I stopped
compiling it last week.

08:33.630 --> 08:36.340
Not the right time
to be hiring new people.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.930
Investors like fresh meat.

08:38.970 --> 08:41.430
Well, then let's focus on
finding new investors--

08:41.470 --> 08:43.730
not new employees.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.600
We all set for tonight?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.730
I just got off the phone
with the Amandar Soho.

08:47.770 --> 08:51.110
We're good to go. 8:00.

08:51.150 --> 08:52.530
Spoke
to Siobhan?

08:52.570 --> 08:54.530
Why would I?

08:54.570 --> 08:55.990
Because she did
plan the event.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.320
And I let her pick out
the cocktail napkins.

08:58.370 --> 09:01.910
But I'll take it from
here, thank you very much.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.110
[saw whirring]

10:12.150 --> 10:14.190
[phone ringing]

10:21.410 --> 10:22.620
Malcolm?

10:22.660 --> 10:25.290
-Bridget, what's wrong?
-Everything.

10:26.870 --> 10:29.000
Got to be a little
more specific.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.210
I don't know if I should
say on the phone.

10:31.250 --> 10:34.300
Don't be paranoid.
It's just me.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.090
I killed someone.
In self-defense.

10:39.130 --> 10:40.550
What?

10:40.590 --> 10:43.010
Someone was
after Siobhan.

10:43.050 --> 10:45.560
I-I don't know
what to do.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.770
You have to
call the cops.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.890
I can't.
I'm a fugitive.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.690
Bridget is a fugitive.
Not Siobhan.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.940
Go to the cops
as your sister.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.940
Siobhan just murdered
someone with a stolen gun

10:57.990 --> 10:59.490
that can be traced
back to Bridget.

10:59.530 --> 11:02.370
-I'm screwed either way.
-Then don't stick around.

11:02.410 --> 11:05.830
And go where? I can't
go back to Rock Springs.

11:05.870 --> 11:08.000
I told you,
I'll come and get you.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.620
We'll figure this out.

11:09.660 --> 11:11.120
No! You can't
come here.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.790
Bridge, you got to stop
telling me what I can't do.

11:13.830 --> 11:16.250
-Let me help you.
-How?

11:18.460 --> 11:21.720
If I can't come to you,
then meet me halfway.

11:22.890 --> 11:26.680
-And then what? I...
-I don't know yet.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.640
But I'll help you
figure this out.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.390
Bridge, I'm here
for you.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.810
Friend, sponsor.

11:33.850 --> 11:35.650
Whatever you need.

11:35.690 --> 11:39.240
You got to know
that.

11:39.280 --> 11:41.400
-I do.
-Then meet me.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.660
OK.

11:44.700 --> 11:46.660
[sighs]

11:46.700 --> 11:48.580
When can you leave?

11:48.620 --> 11:49.750
Soon.

11:49.790 --> 11:53.210
The body's
hidden... for now.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.420
I just hope I can
get far enough away

11:55.460 --> 11:57.130
before they find it.

12:13.730 --> 12:16.310
[knock on door]

12:31.660 --> 12:34.080
Mrs. Martin?
You in there?

12:34.120 --> 12:36.500
[knock knock]

12:36.540 --> 12:39.130
Mrs. Martin, this
is Agent Machado.

12:39.170 --> 12:41.760
Your housekeeper said
you might be here.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.440
I can see you.

12:56.770 --> 12:59.020
Sorry! These locks
are tricky.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.820
That's not a problem.
May I come in?

13:00.860 --> 13:02.530
Actually, I was
just leaving.

13:02.570 --> 13:04.860
Well, do you mind if I use
your bathroom real quick?

13:04.900 --> 13:06.700
What is it with cops
and coffee? Really?

13:06.740 --> 13:09.070
I don't know.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.990
But, actually, with the
construction and stuff

13:11.040 --> 13:12.540
it's kind of
a mess in there.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.830
Uh, there's a doughnut
shop across the street.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.840
You mind if we go
somewhere to talk?

13:22.880 --> 13:24.510
Oh, I really can't.

13:24.550 --> 13:25.880
I'm already late for
a doctor's appointment.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.050
Well, I can
give you a lift.

13:27.090 --> 13:28.220
My car's right
across the street.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.050
Thank you. It's all
the way up town.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.680
Ms. Martin, I really
need to talk to you

13:31.720 --> 13:32.930
about your sister.

13:32.970 --> 13:34.930
And I would be happy
to. It's just...

13:34.980 --> 13:36.980
today is really
not a good day.

13:37.020 --> 13:40.270
Hi. I need to go
to 57th and Fifth.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.990
FBI AGENT:
Everything you'd ever

13:46.030 --> 13:47.820
want to know about
Siobhan and Andrew Martin.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.370
-Anything interesting?
-Not exactly a page turner.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.740
Typical Upper East Siders.
He's in finance.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.330
She's on the board
of every charity.

13:54.370 --> 13:56.750
Married five years.
Honeymooned in Paris.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.420
Her favorite movie,
"The Notebook."

13:58.460 --> 14:00.670
His, a tie between "Raging Bull"
and "Singing in the Rain."

14:00.710 --> 14:02.590
Where'd you get that?

14:02.630 --> 14:04.130
Facebook.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.380
Not exactly the types
to harbor a fugitive.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.050
Yeah. I found letters
in a bus station locker

14:08.090 --> 14:10.220
that prove
Siobhan Martin lied

14:10.260 --> 14:11.800
about being
in touch with her sister.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.600
I don't trust her.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.430
Well, what else
can I do?

14:17.100 --> 14:19.060
The Martins own a loft
on Warren Street.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.940
See what you can dig up.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.530
HENRY: Why would I
be having an affair?

14:33.580 --> 14:35.620
Where do I start?

14:35.660 --> 14:37.290
We don't spend time
together,

14:37.330 --> 14:38.710
we constantly argue,

14:38.750 --> 14:40.790
and we never
have sex anymore.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.840
We have
three-year-old twins.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.250
It's kinda hard
to get romantic

14:44.300 --> 14:46.630
in between finger-painting
and food fights, Gemma.

14:46.670 --> 14:49.430
And we argue because
couples argue.

14:49.470 --> 14:52.340
And spending time together--
you work constantly.

14:52.390 --> 14:54.640
And I am trying to
finish a book.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.640
So... it's about
being busy,

14:57.680 --> 14:58.930
not about having
an affair.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.640
You have an answer
for everything?

15:00.690 --> 15:02.610
Only when
it's the truth.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.400
Look...

15:07.690 --> 15:10.280
I am not having
an affair.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.330
You really got
to believe me.

15:17.830 --> 15:20.290
Then how do you
explain this?

15:20.330 --> 15:22.000
The dry cleaner
found this hotel key

15:22.040 --> 15:23.330
in your suit this morning.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.670
Now you want to
tell me the truth?

16:04.460 --> 16:06.710
Afternoon, ma'am.
How can I help you?

16:06.750 --> 16:10.550
I'd like to withdraw
some money.

16:10.590 --> 16:13.010
I recently changed
the PIN on my account,

16:13.050 --> 16:14.930
and I already forgot it.

16:14.970 --> 16:16.720
May I see your
driver's license?

16:18.310 --> 16:20.310
Of course.

16:32.610 --> 16:34.740
Can you please come with me?

16:37.950 --> 16:41.120
BRANCH MANAGER: How many
times have I told you?

16:41.160 --> 16:43.460
If you ever need
anything, Mrs. Martin,

16:43.500 --> 16:45.080
come directly to me.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.840
Special clients get
special treatment.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.710
I know...

16:51.760 --> 16:53.220
Mr. Atkins.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.260
I was in a rush. I didn't
want to bother you.

16:55.300 --> 16:56.640
Oh... What can
I do for you?

16:56.680 --> 16:58.350
I would like
to withdraw

16:58.390 --> 16:59.850
the balance from my
checking account.

16:59.890 --> 17:02.220
One moment...

17:04.440 --> 17:06.440
There's not much
in there.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.690
Whatever it is,
I'm sure it's fine.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.150
Huh. What about the account
you had me set up

17:13.190 --> 17:15.150
last month
for emergencies only?

17:17.490 --> 17:19.160
Does a shoe sale
at Bergdorf's

17:19.200 --> 17:20.830
constitute
an emergency?

17:20.870 --> 17:22.790
[chuckles]

17:32.550 --> 17:35.050
-I need to go to the airport.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.730
[cell phone ringing]

17:56.030 --> 17:58.610
[cell phone ringing]

18:05.870 --> 18:07.500
Hello?

18:07.540 --> 18:10.330
ANDREW:
Any news on Juliet?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.340
Yeah, she came
back this morning.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.210
Well, is she all right?

18:14.250 --> 18:17.340
She's fine.
Her usual self.

18:17.380 --> 18:20.680
At least that's one problem
at bay for the moment.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.350
What's wrong?

18:22.390 --> 18:24.010
A pipe burst
at the Amandar.

18:24.060 --> 18:25.890
The whole first
floor's flooded.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.020
That's... unfortunate.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.690
Tell me about it.

18:29.730 --> 18:32.270
Olivia's not back yet,
so now all this is on me.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.610
So my first thought was,

18:33.650 --> 18:34.980
where am I going
to book something

18:35.030 --> 18:36.860
on such short notice?

18:36.900 --> 18:38.400
For...?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.320
The cocktail
party tonight.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.910
Oh, please, don't tell
me you've forgotten.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.910
No, of course not. I...

18:43.950 --> 18:46.910
Um, I... just
had my hair done.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.710
Good. So then
I had an idea.

18:48.750 --> 18:51.750
Now, it's not ideal, but
under the circumstances...

18:51.790 --> 18:53.420
Great.
Where's the party?

18:53.460 --> 18:55.550
The loft.

18:58.090 --> 19:01.220
What? That's
a terrible idea.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.890
But it's empty,
and it's big.

19:02.930 --> 19:05.680
Well, yeah, and it's
completely unfinished.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.350
I-I mean, and the tools
that are lying around...

19:07.390 --> 19:10.390
I mean, it's, it's a lawsuit
waiting to happen!

19:10.440 --> 19:13.360
We can fit at least
300 people in there.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.820
Now, trust me, Siobh.

19:14.860 --> 19:16.860
With a little bit of work
and your imagination,

19:16.900 --> 19:18.320
we can turn it
around by 8:00.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.860
Now, I need you
to head over there.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.360
I want you
to supervise.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.320
Andrew, I really
don't think this--

19:23.370 --> 19:24.910
I've already e-mailed
the building manager

19:24.950 --> 19:26.870
to let the event planner in.

19:26.910 --> 19:28.500
He's on his way now.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.470
Keep the change.

19:50.140 --> 19:52.140
MAN: Bacon on that?
You got it.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.650
What do you want?

20:02.110 --> 20:05.410
-All right. You got it?
-Yep. Here we go.

20:05.450 --> 20:06.580
Wait!

20:09.490 --> 20:11.210
Sorry.

20:13.370 --> 20:16.630
WOMAN: No. That--take it down.
Take it down immediately.

20:20.670 --> 20:22.840
EVENT PLANNER: Siobhan!
You look gorgeous, as usual!

20:22.880 --> 20:25.640
Per your suggestion, I went
with a "Titanic" vibe.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.800
Antiquated. Elegant.
Steamer trunks.

20:27.850 --> 20:29.140
Violins.
Gin and tonics.

20:29.180 --> 20:30.810
It'll feel very
Euro and travel-y,

20:30.850 --> 20:32.810
and make people want to
hand over their money.

20:32.850 --> 20:33.980
Do you love it?

20:34.020 --> 20:36.100
Yes.

20:36.150 --> 20:38.650
Yeah! Um...

20:38.690 --> 20:40.650
You know, I was
thinking we should give

20:40.690 --> 20:41.820
everyone a break.

20:41.860 --> 20:42.990
Oh, there's no time.

20:43.030 --> 20:44.530
Of course there is.
Come on.

20:44.570 --> 20:48.030
The bacon food truck's
downstairs, and I'm buying.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.540
Well, tempt me with trans
fats and I can't say no.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.080
Let's take 20
for lunch, everyone!

20:52.120 --> 20:53.290
On Mrs. Martin!

20:53.330 --> 20:55.960
Hurry up before she
changes her mind.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.380
You look like... you're
gonna be cold.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.550
[scoffs] Save it.

21:45.590 --> 21:47.720
-Where are you going?
-Out.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.220
Are you sure that's
such a good idea?

21:50.260 --> 21:51.720
Mm... yeah.

21:53.390 --> 21:55.890
Look, Juliet, I know
where you're headed.

21:55.930 --> 21:57.390
And it's not pretty.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.520
What the hell
do you know?

21:59.560 --> 22:02.480
A lot more
than you think.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.780
I used to know a girl who
partied a little too much.

22:06.820 --> 22:10.160
She did it because
she felt alone,

22:10.200 --> 22:11.870
and it sucked.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.370
But no one told her

22:13.410 --> 22:15.660
she didn't have
to feel that way.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.830
I don't want
that for you.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.590
And I know you
don't care about me.

22:21.630 --> 22:24.050
but you might want
to at least consider

22:24.090 --> 22:26.090
your dad in all this.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.340
He really loves you.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.890
You're hilarious,
Siobhan.

22:32.930 --> 22:34.220
For a second,

22:34.260 --> 22:36.930
it almost seemed
like you gave a crap.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.780
Why are you fidgeting?

22:49.820 --> 22:53.240
The room looks amazing.
You look fantastic.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.580
Trust me, you have nothing
to worry about.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.500
I guess I'm just nervous
about tonight.

22:57.540 --> 23:01.170
Why? You've done this
a thousand times.

23:01.210 --> 23:02.540
Yeah, just somehow
it feels like

23:02.580 --> 23:04.000
I've never
done it before.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.300
Oh, it's easy.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.460
Just stay away from
politics and religion.

23:07.510 --> 23:10.130
Stick to tennis, St. Barts,
and the stock market.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.550
You'll be fine.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.640
And when in doubt...

23:15.470 --> 23:17.600
drink lots of champagne.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.650
MAN: ♪ Girl,
every time I see you ♪

23:22.690 --> 23:24.560
♪ I just want to get you home ♪

23:24.610 --> 23:26.270
WOMAN: ♪ Well, I just
can't stop dancing ♪

23:26.320 --> 23:28.030
♪ For, oh, so long ♪

23:28.070 --> 23:29.860
MAN: ♪ Ooh, your body
is so close ♪

23:29.900 --> 23:31.860
♪ And I just want
to turn you on ♪

23:31.910 --> 23:33.820
WOMAN: ♪ As I'm coming
closer to you ♪

23:33.870 --> 23:35.330
♪ I just want to take
you home... ♪

23:35.370 --> 23:37.370
Your tan is amazing.

23:37.410 --> 23:38.620
Thank you.

23:38.660 --> 23:40.410
Let me guess...
St. Barts?

23:40.460 --> 23:43.250
We vacationed there with
my in-laws last weekend!

23:43.290 --> 23:44.920
So I went
to that dermatologist

23:44.960 --> 23:46.460
you recommended,

23:46.500 --> 23:48.090
but my Botox doesn't look
as natural as yours.

23:53.510 --> 23:56.930
Excuse me for one second.
I'm sorry.

23:58.890 --> 24:02.850
Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.
Um, that's an antique.

24:02.890 --> 24:06.110
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

24:06.150 --> 24:07.480
I'm sure you'll be much
more comfortable.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.070
Sure. Thanks.

24:21.410 --> 24:22.830
Hey, you OK?

24:22.870 --> 24:26.130
My face hurts from
smiling so much.

24:26.170 --> 24:28.130
I can't believe how
it all came together.

24:28.170 --> 24:32.010
No one would believe the
mess here three hours ago.

24:32.050 --> 24:34.300
You have no idea.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.890
You look lovely,
by the way.

24:37.930 --> 24:40.100
Thank you.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.730
Siobhan, darling.

24:44.770 --> 24:47.230
Oh, do you mind
if I steal your husband?

24:49.860 --> 24:51.690
[chuckles]

24:55.740 --> 24:58.870
Olivia's the reason why
women hate other women.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.750
She's Andrew's partner.

25:04.790 --> 25:06.420
Sorry. I know I shouldn't
talk about her that way.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.710
She is a financial genius.

25:08.750 --> 25:10.460
Wouldn't trust
anyone else with my money.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.760
Still, though,
she's a snake in Louboutins.

25:15.470 --> 25:16.890
I give you credit,

25:16.930 --> 25:19.140
letting Andrew work
alongside that.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.430
Easy, there.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.390
I need it.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.560
What happened?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.230
I'll tell you later.

25:29.270 --> 25:31.440
Just let me get
through tonight.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.280
I couldn't agree more.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.260
Having fun?

25:55.300 --> 25:56.590
Not really.

25:56.630 --> 25:59.050
Gemma forced me to come.

25:59.090 --> 26:01.720
Not sure why.
We're not exactly speaking.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.480
She found my key
to the Dandridge.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.140
What? When?

26:07.190 --> 26:09.520
This morning.
Relax.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.480
I denied the affair.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.110
Told her I go there
to write.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.820
And she believed you?

26:15.860 --> 26:18.320
Well, it's the truth...

26:18.360 --> 26:19.910
sort of.

26:20.990 --> 26:24.290
I mean, there is no affair
anymore, right?

26:27.370 --> 26:30.500
Just... just tell me.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.090
What did I do wrong?

26:40.550 --> 26:43.010
Excuse me.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.810
Mrs. Martin.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.320
Agent Machado?

26:55.360 --> 26:56.860
I'm sorry to crash,

26:56.900 --> 26:59.950
but, you know, you're
a tough lady to pin down,

26:59.990 --> 27:02.660
and I figured you wouldn't
bail on your own party.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.370
Hope you don't mind.
I'm starving.

27:07.410 --> 27:09.460
Help yourself.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.630
Mmm, pretty good.

27:15.250 --> 27:17.630
Can we talk?

27:19.510 --> 27:23.090
Fine, but not here.

27:27.310 --> 27:31.850
You know that this building
used to be a cannery

27:31.900 --> 27:33.610
back in the '20s?

27:33.650 --> 27:36.070
-No, I didn't.
-Yeah, yeah.

27:36.110 --> 27:37.480
And then a department
store in the late '60s.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.650
What was it?
Feinsilver's.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.320
That's right.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.280
And, in fact, your loft,
that was the men's section.

27:42.320 --> 27:46.790
Did you come here to
give me a history lesson?

27:46.830 --> 27:50.580
No. No, I just,
I love old buildings.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.500
I love 'em.
I love the history

27:52.540 --> 27:54.830
and I love
the architecture.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.090
Your contractor's doing
a great job, by the way.

27:56.130 --> 27:57.840
I mean, really,
really maintaining

27:57.880 --> 28:00.340

of this place.

Some may see it
as desperate,

we call it strategic.

talking about?

30:59.600 --> 31:02.020
Getting pregnant.

31:02.980 --> 31:06.860
Getting pregnant
is not a strategy.

31:08.150 --> 31:11.280
[quietly] It is if you need
to hold on to your husband.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.830
What are you two
whispering about?

31:13.870 --> 31:15.120
I was just
telling Siobhan

31:15.160 --> 31:16.790

about the baby.

31:16.830 --> 31:19.290
Ah, well, that makes

staff to come back tomorrow.

exhausted.

something to talk about.

Not really.

I'm a disaster.

Gemma, if Henry makes
you this unhappy,

32:21.680 --> 32:23.230
why don't you just
leave him?

32:23.270 --> 32:25.190
I can't.

32:25.230 --> 32:27.320
Why not?

Did I do
something wrong?

33:04.600 --> 33:06.100
No.

Quite the opposite.

at the party.

handled everyone.

anything that special.

Oh, no, you did.

you were on my side.
