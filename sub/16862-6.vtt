WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:03.040
Previously on rescue me...

00:03.070 --> 00:06.130
Jerry was a great guy and a great firefighter, and

00:06.170 --> 00:07.440
I got big shoes to fill.

00:07.470 --> 00:09.540
Call me chief sid, chief sidney, chief whatever.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.080
Just don't call me chief feinberg.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.590
Ok, word on the street from very reliable sources,

00:13.620 --> 00:15.430
the guy's hung like seabiscuit.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.760
What is going on with you and tommy?

00:17.790 --> 00:20.090
It is seriously freakin' me out.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.110
What are you talkin' about?

00:21.150 --> 00:23.270
You're wearin' the same stupid peacoat that he wears all the time.

00:23.310 --> 00:25.020
It's like you're turning into tommy gavin.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.970
I think that we owe it to each other to...

00:28.000 --> 00:32.750
put the sex on hold, and let's see what we really have.

00:32.790 --> 00:34.680
And to safeguard against the very real possibility

00:34.730 --> 00:37.400
that without a breather, my dick's gonna snap off like a twig.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.000
I want us to be together forever.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.840
Aw, I'll see what I can do about that.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.130
- The chick I been seein', man...
- Yeah.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.700
She took my little girl, man.
She took keela.

00:44.730 --> 00:45.640
Aw, man.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.070
You know how I need to stay here for a couple of days?

00:48.100 --> 00:50.090
Think it might be a little longer than that.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.050
Yeah, it's all good.
Whatever you need, bro.

00:52.070 --> 00:53.550
All right, cool.
Thanks.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.740
I want you to give me that baby.

00:55.770 --> 00:56.280
You're crazy.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.220
No, no, I-I hate it when you call me crazy.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.170
Just listen to me.

00:59.190 --> 01:02.810
I love this baby, and that baby loves me.

01:02.840 --> 01:05.630
I was hopin' that¡ª

01:08.720 --> 01:11.010
Will you marry me?

01:12.160 --> 01:15.490
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm serious.

01:15.520 --> 01:18.180
Yes!Yes, I will marry you, franco. Yes.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.400
All I wanna do is fight fires and play ball.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.350
We're definitely interested.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.250
I don't mop nothing, shine nothing, cook nothing, clean nothing.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.610
I don't run errands, make beds, and I don't hump equipment.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.040
So in other words, you don't do probie work.

01:31.070 --> 01:34.780
- Right. Do not call me probie.
- You got it.

01:34.810 --> 01:37.610
His hair is black doesn't necessarily mean that he's

01:37.640 --> 01:41.820
definitely johnny's kid, right?

01:41.840 --> 01:43.760
Whose is he, then?

01:44.290 --> 01:46.320
You tell me.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.280
Just go to hell.

02:01.010 --> 02:02.930
You must be the new probie, huh?

02:02.950 --> 02:04.170
I'm shawn.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.250
Um, it's time for some coffee there, black shawn.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.550
I think you probably already know how to make coffee.

02:08.570 --> 02:10.160
That's like probie 101, right?

02:10.190 --> 02:13.230
Ok, man, I don't know shit about makin' coffee, all right?

02:13.250 --> 02:14.330
I don't drink it.

02:14.350 --> 02:16.140
Jangles my nerves.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.460
- Jangles your nerves?
- Yep.

02:18.490 --> 02:19.550
Really?

02:21.050 --> 02:21.970
Let me tell you somethin', pal.

02:21.990 --> 02:24.100
I don't give a good goddamn whether you like coffee or not.

02:24.130 --> 02:26.260
I like coffee. That's the important fact here, ok?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.160
And you're gonna be black shawn,

02:27.200 --> 02:29.190
'cause we already have a white sean who works in this house, ok,

02:29.220 --> 02:31.460
and he's got seniority over you, all right?

02:31.490 --> 02:34.070
No.
I'm not gonna be black shawn.

02:34.100 --> 02:35.060
Just shawn, all right?

02:35.090 --> 02:36.300
Let me tell you somethin', asshole.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.980
- You're gonna do what we tell you to do.
- Hey, hey, hey. What's up, guys?

02:38.010 --> 02:39.140
Get your feet off the table.

02:39.170 --> 02:41.490
- What's goin' on-
- Hey, man. You must be the new probie.

02:41.520 --> 02:42.740
I'm on the basketball team with you.

02:42.770 --> 02:46.060
- I'm-I'm sean.
- No, I'm shawn.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.900
You gotta find a new name, son.

02:48.450 --> 02:50.210
You just call him "son"?

02:50.230 --> 02:51.490
Where do you get off callin' him son?

02:51.510 --> 02:53.070
- Hey, shawn.
- What up, lou?

02:53.110 --> 02:54.420
Hey, asshole!

02:54.460 --> 02:55.470
I'm talkin' to you.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.930
- What-
- I don't understand.

02:58.490 --> 03:01.060
You know, I-I'm not even workin' today.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.370
- Hey, hey, whoa.
- Ah, ah, ah. Ah. Ah. Ah.

03:04.390 --> 03:06.350
This better be a gag.

03:06.370 --> 03:08.930
I just asked that kid to make me coffee, and he refused.

03:08.960 --> 03:09.970
Yeah. And I don't know if you heard him.

03:10.010 --> 03:11.220
He told me I had to- I had to change my-

03:11.240 --> 03:15.000
Yeah, we, uh-we had to make a little, you know, arrangement.

03:15.030 --> 03:16.030
What kind of an arrangement?

03:16.050 --> 03:19.440
Hey, uh, lou, I got the soap and the mop. Ok.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.870
- Franco.
- Yeah?

03:22.910 --> 03:24.750
Was that just a mop I saw in your hands?

03:25.440 --> 03:27.360
Naw. I-

03:27.920 --> 03:29.500
- yeah. It was a mop.
- Ok, you haven't had a mop

03:29.540 --> 03:33.060
in your hands since bill clinton was gettin' blow jobs in the white house, and you

03:33.090 --> 03:34.910
haven't been involved in cleaning the rig since

03:34.940 --> 03:36.990
huey lewis last had a hit single, so what's goin' on?

03:37.020 --> 03:38.080
Ok, look. All right,

03:38.130 --> 03:42.230
we ran into some other houses who had promised certain perks

03:42.270 --> 03:45.080
during the negotiation process, so in order for us

03:45.120 --> 03:46.920
to get the kid to this house,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.420
we had to make some promises, you know, of our own.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.370
Such as?

03:50.400 --> 03:51.930
Um, you know, he doesn't cook. He doesn't clean.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.420
He doesn't scrub. He doesn't shine.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.800
- He doesn't get his balls busted.
- What does he do?

03:55.840 --> 03:58.380
Uh, he, uh, plays hoops is what he does.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:59.170 --> 04:00.220
And fights fires.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.680
And, uh, you gotta change your name, bro.

04:01.710 --> 04:02.750
Yeah.
Why?

04:02.780 --> 04:04.000
Well, he wants to be called shawn.

04:04.030 --> 04:06.030
Yeah. Even though his, uh, real name is, uh-

04:06.080 --> 04:07.930
- is bart.
- Right?

04:08.570 --> 04:10.130
Well, why can't he just be, you know,

04:10.170 --> 04:12.100
black shawn, and I'll be, you know, me?

04:12.140 --> 04:14.750
Because he, uh-he just really doesn't wanna do that.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.260
Well, tough shit.
It's my god-given name.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.750
Yeah, but he averages 30 points and 12 dimes a game, bro.

04:18.790 --> 04:20.269
Wow. Really?
30 points?

04:20.300 --> 04:21.200
Yeah.
Jesus.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.850
Ok. You know what?
I'll-I'll make the coffee.

04:22.870 --> 04:25.100
Ah. All right, I've had a problem with this basketball thing

04:25.140 --> 04:26.050
since you brought it back up again.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.770
- Well, you know, this is the reason why...
- You puttin' the team back together again.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.790
- I didn't tell you about this thing.
- What? What's the reason why?

04:29.830 --> 04:30.900
Because it's all you and your hockey, and your hockey-

04:30.940 --> 04:33.090
I never made a promise to anybody that was on the hockey team that

04:33.140 --> 04:34.440
they didn't have to do any work at the firehouse!

04:34.470 --> 04:35.510
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:35.540 --> 04:37.470
- Not even siletti got a free ride!
- All right!All right!All right!

04:37.510 --> 04:39.250
Jesus.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.350
Now, listen.

04:41.380 --> 04:42.910
If you guys wanna call me somethin' different,

04:42.940 --> 04:45.690
I think that-that you should give me a cool nickname, you know,

04:45.740 --> 04:48.160
like, uh-like killer.

04:49.970 --> 04:51.000
That's cool, right?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.890
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.210
No?

04:54.240 --> 04:57.730
All right, well- We'll, uh-we'll just call you garrity. How about that?

04:57.790 --> 04:59.170
Yeah, no, that's so impersonal.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.150
You know, I want somethin'-

05:00.220 --> 05:01.920
All right. Well, maybe we should call you by your middle name.

05:01.950 --> 05:03.450
Yeah, what's your middle name?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.640
- My middle name?
- Yeah.

05:04.660 --> 05:08.290
You know, I think that, uh- actually, I kind of like garrity.

05:08.310 --> 05:10.540
Garrity's fine.
Let's stick with that.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.690
Aw, jesus.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.970
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:14.990 --> 05:16.380
- How are you?
- Great.

05:16.410 --> 05:18.230
So we're gonna need to get that middle name from you.

05:18.260 --> 05:19.210
Yeah, you know, it's so funny.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.710
I don't-I don't even have

05:20.790 --> 05:21.430
- a middle name.
- Oh, you don't?

05:21.460 --> 05:22.100
- Really?
- My parents, when they-

05:22.130 --> 05:23.130
Oh, well, that's fine.

05:23.170 --> 05:25.240
Lou, why don't you jump on the computer and check the department files

05:25.290 --> 05:26.190
- about-
- I'm on my way.

05:26.220 --> 05:26.980
It's not-you're not gonna find anything.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.530
- I'm back.
- Ok.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.320
It's, um...

05:34.490 --> 05:35.650
leslie.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.160
Yeah.
Enjoy. Ok?

05:37.180 --> 05:37.990
Leslie?

05:38.010 --> 05:39.180
Leslie leslie?

05:39.210 --> 05:40.520
- It's like a dream come true.
- It really is.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.370
- Guys, it's irish.
- Oh, it's not irish.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.540
- It's irish.
- I'm irish.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.760
- Never heard of it.
- It means "warrior prince"

05:44.800 --> 05:46.630
- in irish-or gaelic.
- They named you after a girl.

05:46.660 --> 05:49.000
All right, it's my mother's sister's name, and she loved her very much,

05:49.040 --> 05:51.210
so could you just please not call me that?

05:51.240 --> 05:54.340
Look, look, guys, you know, maybe it isn't fair.

05:54.380 --> 05:55.310
Maybe he's-he's got a point.

05:55.350 --> 05:57.540
You know, here's the deal.
Here's what we should do.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.395
We're all gonna get new nicknames,

05:59.430 --> 06:00.760
ok, except me, 'cause I'm lou, you know,

06:00.800 --> 06:02.560
based on my official rank.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.080
And in the event of a disagreement or a tie,

06:05.120 --> 06:07.520
I will cast the deciding vote on

06:07.560 --> 06:09.680
what that new nickname will be.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.000
- Is that all right with you, tom?
- Yeah.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.580
- Ok. Frankie?
- Yes, sir.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.670
All right. Leslie- I'm sorry, ballsack.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.300
- Yeah.
- Oh, hello. That's a nice greeting.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.590
Where'd you go to charm school?

06:20.620 --> 06:22.820
The russell crowe academy.
What do you want?

06:22.850 --> 06:25.690
Um, I was just wondering,

06:25.730 --> 06:28.620
um, if you've, uh, given any more thought to my offer,

06:28.680 --> 06:30.540
you know, of giving me the baby,

06:30.560 --> 06:32.050
which i know sounds a little weird.

06:32.090 --> 06:35.770
Yeah, yeah. A little weird, not to mention morally insane.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.640
You know, I'm sorry that it sounds so cold,

06:37.680 --> 06:40.010
but jesus christ, he doesn't even have a name yet.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.160
I'll tell you somethin' else.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.460
If you wanna feel sorry, I'll tell what you should feel sorry about is

06:43.480 --> 06:44.890
giving me that bullshit story

06:44.940 --> 06:47.000
about how I couldn't get it up the night of the fire,

06:47.050 --> 06:48.780
just so you could get your hands on the insurance money,

06:48.810 --> 06:50.830
and now you're gonna use that insurance money to try and buy my-

06:50.870 --> 06:53.920
my son or my brother's son or whatever the hell he is, huh?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.570
Why don't you feel sorry about that?

07:01.390 --> 07:03.130
Great.
That helped.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.160
Hey, mikey.

07:54.190 --> 07:57.330
Listen, let's go over their names, the nicknames I got, ok?

07:57.350 --> 07:59.090
How 'bout big G.?

07:59.110 --> 08:01.060
Oh, you know what?
Even better,

08:01.090 --> 08:02.700
G.Money, you know,

08:02.730 --> 08:05.250
'cause I'm like so money on the basketball court.

08:05.270 --> 08:06.870
Huh?

08:06.890 --> 08:08.410
What do you think?
Mikey?

08:08.430 --> 08:10.040
Just a sec.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.490
What are you doin'?

08:14.500 --> 08:15.710
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.840
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.740
- Just straightenin' stuff up.
- Yeah.

08:19.770 --> 08:22.240
- Well, what's-
- ai!

08:23.060 --> 08:24.480
- Why was the door locked?
- I don't know.

08:24.510 --> 08:27.200
Maybe it locked by accident or somethin', G.Money.

08:27.220 --> 08:28.820
- Hey, you like it?
- Yeah.

08:28.850 --> 08:29.360
It's-it's ok.

08:29.390 --> 08:31.810
Yeah, do me a favor. Start callin' me G.Money around the firehouse, you know.

08:31.850 --> 08:32.950
See if it sticks.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.580
I'm sick and tired of this leslie shit.

08:34.630 --> 08:35.679
- Ok, cool.
- Cool.

08:35.730 --> 08:36.799
- Yeah.
- Ok, cool.

08:36.830 --> 08:38.690
- After you.
- G-go ahead.

08:38.730 --> 08:40.679
- No, I'm bein' gentlemanly.
- No, you go first.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.940
Oh, my-weirdo.
You're weird.

08:47.900 --> 08:49.840
All right, where is it?

08:49.860 --> 08:51.560
- Where's what?
- You know what.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.680
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

08:53.710 --> 08:55.680
You mean that?

08:55.710 --> 08:57.460
Yes.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.080
Thank you.

09:00.050 --> 09:01.370
Ok, where are the batteries?

09:01.400 --> 09:02.630
Well, you might find that, uh,

09:02.660 --> 09:06.510
most of the double "a" batteries, uh, in this house have mysteriously disappeared.

09:06.550 --> 09:10.530
Look, I thought we were supposed to be having a break from the sex, ok,

09:10.580 --> 09:11.940
getting to know each other.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.360
It has taken me 35 years to start having sex.

09:14.390 --> 09:15.930
35 years, ok?!

09:15.970 --> 09:17.910
Don't make me feel dirty for having an appetite.

09:17.950 --> 09:20.600
Most guys, you know, they would-they would kill to be in your shoes.

09:20.630 --> 09:23.470
Look, let's not fight, ok?

09:24.460 --> 09:26.050
Ok.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.830
- I don't-I don't-
- I do.

09:27.850 --> 09:29.710
- I don't wanna do that either.
- Oh, my god.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.620
Ok?
Ok, listen. Listen.

09:31.670 --> 09:34.110
My cousin mike is coming over for a couple days, ok?

09:34.150 --> 09:36.160
I don't want there to be a lot of tension in this house.

09:36.190 --> 09:37.670
What?When were you going to tell me that?

09:37.700 --> 09:38.670
I was gonna tell you this morning.

09:38.710 --> 09:40.790
That was before I met your little plastic boyfriend.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.500
Oh, that is great.
That is really-you were-uhh.

09:43.530 --> 09:44.720
It's just for a couple days.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.140
He's putting his boat in the water for fishing season, ok?

09:47.180 --> 09:49.020
Will you please-will you just please try to be nice?

09:49.060 --> 09:50.220
- You want me to be nice?
- Yeah.

09:50.270 --> 09:51.340
You want me to be nice?
You know what, then?

09:51.380 --> 09:54.250
You had better pray that those double as reappear,

09:54.290 --> 09:56.660
because otherwise, you're gonna see a new version of bitch.

09:56.690 --> 09:59.490
- Got that, big boy?
- Yeah.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.010
Yeah, I got it.

10:04.510 --> 10:07.630
All right, katy, come on.
You're gonna be late.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.760
Hurry up.

10:10.850 --> 10:13.680
Where's her lunch?

10:14.580 --> 10:16.960
- Honey.
- Yeah?

10:18.250 --> 10:19.590
Where's her lunch?

10:19.610 --> 10:21.920
Oh. Um, yeah. No, I forgot that this morning.

10:21.950 --> 10:23.110
She can just grab something at school.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.480
The food at school tastes like poo.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.570
Oh, how would you know what poo tastes like?

10:27.590 --> 10:30.920
- I use my imagination.
- Ok, do me a favor.

10:32.010 --> 10:35.290
Use your imagination for something a little bit more constructive,

10:35.320 --> 10:39.840
like reading or writing.
Take that and that, ok?

10:39.870 --> 10:41.730
All right, have a good day.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.280
Say good-bye to your brother.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.700
He smells like poo.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.250
He's supposed to smell like poo.
He's a baby.

10:47.270 --> 10:49.110
- All right?
- Yeah, yeah, good-bye.

10:49.130 --> 10:50.380
Bye.

10:56.470 --> 11:00.350
- You ok?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

11:02.170 --> 11:04.460
All right.
I'm gonna go.

11:05.230 --> 11:06.860
You're all set?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.890
Yep.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.400
See ya.

11:21.460 --> 11:24.580
Hey, gather round.
We got some new uniforms here.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.100
- All right.
- Nice.

11:26.130 --> 11:28.080
Check it out, boys.
Chief sprung for 'em.

11:28.110 --> 11:28.880
What's going on?

11:28.950 --> 11:31.350
Chief got, uh, some new uniforms for the basketball team.

11:31.370 --> 11:32.340
Sweet, huh?

11:32.380 --> 11:35.440
You know the hockey team's been tryin' to get new uniforms for, like, 5 years.

11:35.970 --> 11:38.150
We have a serious shot at winning this championship.

11:38.180 --> 11:39.280
Never liked hockey, anyways.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.350
Always reminded me of figure skating.
You know, kinda faggy.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.200
Yeah. You know, plus you gotta put all that equipment on, you know,

11:43.240 --> 11:44.800
helmets and pads and skates and shit.

11:44.840 --> 11:49.410
Ok, first of all, "faggy" is a word that has never been connected to hockey before, ok?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.290
And second of all, the reason you wear the pads and the-

11:51.360 --> 11:52.890
and the helmet and all that stuff is because,

11:52.930 --> 11:54.520
again, proving that it's not faggy-

11:54.570 --> 11:55.440
'cause you can get killed.

11:55.470 --> 11:57.770
But basketball is an american sport.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.610
You wanna play hockey, should go to canada.

11:59.650 --> 12:00.540
Thank you.

12:00.580 --> 12:02.750
Oh, really?
Yeah?

12:02.780 --> 12:04.020
Let me ask you somethin', pal.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.200
You ever skate, on anything other than a charge?

12:07.230 --> 12:08.720
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I grew up on flatbush ave.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.330
- What do you think?
- Easy, easy.

12:09.350 --> 12:10.120
- Easy, easy.
- Yeah?Yeah?

12:10.160 --> 12:11.380
- Easy, easy.
- Yeah.

12:11.410 --> 12:12.810
Hey. Hey, look at it. Look.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.650
Downtown.

12:14.670 --> 12:16.130
- What?
- What?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.660
I- downtown.
That's my new nickname.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.820
I just thought of it.
Or paint.

12:19.850 --> 12:21.340
- Paint.
- Why paint?

12:21.380 --> 12:22.610
Well, because, you know, like in the paint.

12:22.650 --> 12:24.660
I'm always in the paint, settin' screens, grabbin' rebounds.

12:24.690 --> 12:25.830
You never been anywhere near the paint.

12:25.850 --> 12:28.210
You're a guard, all right?
I'd rather call you taint than paint.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.190
- Yeah, taint.
- I like it.

12:29.230 --> 12:30.650
- I like it.
- It's got a nice ring.

12:30.670 --> 12:31.880
No.
I'm sorry.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.890
Hey, what about you, stretch?

12:33.930 --> 12:36.300
You ever get them bones out there on the court?

12:36.330 --> 12:38.600
Yeah, I played once or twice.
Why?

12:38.630 --> 12:39.630
I don't know.

12:39.650 --> 12:42.800
Why don't you quit running your mouth and, uh, suit up?

12:54.420 --> 12:56.680
There. I think I just saw it move under his sweatpants.

12:56.710 --> 12:59.020
No, I-that-I think it's his keys.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.150
By his ankle?
How deep are those pockets?

13:02.180 --> 13:03.690
He's probably not wearing underwear.

13:03.730 --> 13:04.930
You think he'd be that careless?

13:04.980 --> 13:07.710
Shit, lou, if I had an elephant trunk rather than an earthworm,

13:07.780 --> 13:09.600
I'd be walking around in a banana hammock.

13:09.630 --> 13:11.800
I'd have the beast on parade every day.

13:11.820 --> 13:15.560
Franco and, uh, shawn choose 'em up.
Ok, franco goes first.

13:15.590 --> 13:18.710
Uh, it's a no-brainer.
I'll take, uh, stretch.

13:19.220 --> 13:19.900
Stretch?

13:19.920 --> 13:21.610
Yeah. What, you don't like it?
It just kind of came out.

13:21.630 --> 13:22.310
No.
Don't like it.

13:22.350 --> 13:23.730
My bad. I'll take T.

13:23.780 --> 13:24.910
I'll take leslie.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.790
You know, if tommy doesn't want "stretch," I-I'll take stretch.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.670
- You're 5'8".
- Nay.

13:29.690 --> 13:31.500
Uh, 9.
I'm 5'9".

13:31.530 --> 13:33.330
That's a good nickname.
9.Yeah.

13:33.370 --> 13:34.740
I'll take 9, then.
Come on.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.360
Yeah, you know, I'll just- I'll stick with leslie.

13:37.390 --> 13:39.560
Uh, I'll take stupid.

13:41.980 --> 13:45.010
Do I really have to be any more specific?

13:45.040 --> 13:47.440
- Lou, I don't wanna.
- You're stupid.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.380
All right.
Ok, we go to 15.

13:52.410 --> 13:54.160
Check it up.
Ok?

13:54.190 --> 13:55.410
You know the rules, huh, tommy?

13:55.450 --> 13:57.410
Yeah, I know the rules.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.390
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo.

14:02.630 --> 14:03.560
Hey.

14:03.580 --> 14:04.790
What, you tryin' to kill somebody?

14:04.810 --> 14:06.670
What?He ran into me.
I was already here.

14:06.710 --> 14:07.920
Come on.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.870
Come on, man.
Watch out.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.960
Hey, hey, hey!

14:11.980 --> 14:13.240
- What the hell are you doin'?
- You can't do that.

14:13.270 --> 14:15.190
He ran into me.
Ran right into me.

14:19.360 --> 14:19.465
Nice.

14:19.500 --> 14:20.640
- Heads up.
- Let's do it, baby.

14:20.670 --> 14:21.620
Come on.
Shawn, come on.

14:21.660 --> 14:22.050
Move through. Move through.

14:22.070 --> 14:22.660
- I got it.
- I'm open.

14:22.710 --> 14:23.640
I got it.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.360
Whoa!

14:26.380 --> 14:28.250
- What the hell was that?
- He had the ball.

14:28.270 --> 14:29.980
Aw, come on.
Aw, come on, man.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.830
- You guys are a bunch of pussies.
- What?

14:31.850 --> 14:33.170
Ball in, guys.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.080
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.130
Put it up, T.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.230
- Really?
- Shoot it!

14:40.260 --> 14:41.210
Put it up, t!

14:41.230 --> 14:42.640
- You want me to shoot?
- Take a shot. Come on.

14:42.660 --> 14:43.930
Ok.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.900
You ready to cover this, leslie?
Huh?Yeah?

14:53.970 --> 14:54.780
What the hell was that?

14:54.820 --> 14:55.540
You didn't even hit the glass.

14:55.570 --> 14:56.990
There was some water here.
I slipped.

14:57.010 --> 14:57.880
Oh, my god.
Check it. Our ball.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.910
Try to wipe it from our minds, play some ball here.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.260
It's all right, T.
Yeah, here we go.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.520
Look up. Look up.
Yo, franco!

15:09.080 --> 15:11.070
- Shoot it, T.
- Yeah?

15:11.090 --> 15:13.330
Shoot, baby.
Put it up, T.
Put it up.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.060
Kareem abdul-jabbar, asshole?

15:15.110 --> 15:16.460
- Oh, jesus.
- You know where I'm goin'?

15:16.490 --> 15:17.560
Watch this.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.830
Holy shit.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.760
Hey.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.710
What's cookin'?

15:46.750 --> 15:48.610
This.

15:49.830 --> 15:52.080
Hey, franco.
It's alicia.

15:52.110 --> 15:55.140
Look, I just wanted to let you know that keela and I are back in town,

15:55.170 --> 15:58.540
so of course she'd really like to see you.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.290
We both would.

16:00.310 --> 16:02.050
Call me, baby.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.620
So what?

16:04.640 --> 16:07.200
"So what?" That's all you have to say?

16:07.230 --> 16:08.980
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.470
Well, for starters, you can explain how she got this number.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.370
Well, baby, I don't know, you know?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.760
Maybe she called the firehouse or somethin'.I mean,

16:14.800 --> 16:16.920
you know, what?You think I've been talking to her this whole time?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.410
How the hell should I know?

16:18.430 --> 16:19.610
You're so walled off all the time,

16:19.650 --> 16:22.290
I hardly ever know what the hell's going on inside your head.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.820
Baby, there's nobody else.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.120
All right?
I don't want anyone but you.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.130
Not even your own daughter?

16:28.660 --> 16:31.460
All right, that was a cheap shot.
You know who I'm talking about.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.890
So go see her.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.990
What?
Go see alicia.

16:35.030 --> 16:37.520
You say you're absolutely sure that I'm all you want,

16:37.540 --> 16:39.290
so go see her.

16:42.090 --> 16:46.720
Well, maybe you could, you know, come with me or somethin', meet my daughter.

16:46.740 --> 16:50.140
No. I can't make it that easy for you.

16:50.780 --> 16:54.680
But if you decide to come back, I'll be right here waiting.

16:56.910 --> 16:59.170
You can bring me this.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.240
I'd rather you kept that.

17:04.930 --> 17:08.200
Bring it back to me, and I will.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.350
- Right, right, right.
- A condom.

17:31.370 --> 17:32.750
Uh, no.

17:32.770 --> 17:35.420
What the- what the hell is that?

17:35.440 --> 17:39.080
Oh, that?That's just, uh- it's just some articles and stuff.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.220
Is this tommy's remote control?

17:51.240 --> 17:52.770
Are these his sunglasses.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.640
I just wanted a, you know- a little-little something of his.

17:56.670 --> 17:59.390
You know, I was gonna give it back eventually, but, uh,

17:59.410 --> 18:02.030
I just wanted a little piece of tommy for myself.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.060
Well, you wanna get back to business?

18:05.110 --> 18:07.040
No.

18:07.060 --> 18:09.190
Oh, my god.
Ohh!

18:09.750 --> 18:11.200
I should have known.

18:11.230 --> 18:16.790
Cute, affectionate, respectful, nice, and-oh, yeah, crazy.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.370
I'm not crazy.
It's not like I was hiding it.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.720
Honey, you should have hidden this.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.000
This is crazy.
It's crazy that you didn't hide it.

18:22.030 --> 18:24.170
I got so much of this already in my life, troy.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.070
I- I don't-I got-

18:26.110 --> 18:28.300
Hold on. Sheila, look. I- you know,

18:28.340 --> 18:31.430
I meant all that stuff I said about, you know,

18:31.470 --> 18:34.160
you deserving the good things in life and that,

18:34.190 --> 18:37.950
you know-like you deserve to be loved well.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.770
God, troy, that's- that's really nice.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.940
Come on. Get out of my way, you friggin' psycho!

18:52.770 --> 18:55.290
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:55.310 --> 18:57.270
What's goin' on?

19:08.020 --> 19:09.950
What's goin' on?

19:12.520 --> 19:19.150
Look, you think it makes me happy that as it ends up,

19:19.630 --> 19:22.710
the kid's probably johnny's kid?

19:24.930 --> 19:27.800
It is what it is.

19:27.830 --> 19:31.260
But you don't see me

19:31.300 --> 19:33.460
layin' around all day drinkin' wine,

19:33.500 --> 19:38.270
feeding the other kid 2-day-old-pizza. I mean...

19:46.460 --> 19:49.300
pretty simple equation, you know.

19:49.330 --> 19:52.910
That's because you're never here.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.080
You wanna get into this again?

20:06.100 --> 20:08.460
No, I don'T.

20:26.930 --> 20:28.930
What are you doin'?

20:28.960 --> 20:32.760
Uh, I think he needs a change.
It's been a while.

20:36.220 --> 20:38.490
Yeah. You wanna go grab a diaper for your brother.

20:38.510 --> 20:40.870
- Oh, he's not my brother.
- Ok.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.530
He is your brother, all right?

20:42.560 --> 20:44.890
He didn't come from you.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.790
Whether he came from me or from your uncle johnny, ok,

20:48.830 --> 20:51.940
he still has the same mother as you, ok, so...

20:51.970 --> 20:55.100
No, it makes a difference.
It means he's my cousin.

20:56.510 --> 20:59.620
Your cousin, your brother, I mean, what difference does it make?

20:59.650 --> 21:01.390
He's definitely my cousin.

21:01.410 --> 21:03.770
'Cause if he was my brother, I wouldn't hate him so much.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.170
Hey, hey.
I didn't hate connor.

21:06.200 --> 21:10.140
Of course you didn't hate connor, and you-you have no reason to hate...

21:10.160 --> 21:13.920
- He doesn't even have a name!
- We're still makin' lists. Here.

21:13.950 --> 21:16.310
- You should give him a name.
- Yeah, ok.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.420
Hey, pal.
How you doin', huh?

21:18.450 --> 21:20.260
Yeah.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.840
How you doin'?
Huh?

21:22.860 --> 21:25.750
Hey, did you see this face he's makin'?

21:28.560 --> 21:30.880
All right.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.610
Wanna get changed?

21:55.470 --> 21:57.970
Ok.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.550
Ok.

21:59.570 --> 22:02.210
This is bullshit, ok?

22:02.240 --> 22:04.610
It's- checkin' to see how much meat the new chief's packing,

22:04.640 --> 22:06.320
that's a goddamn probie's job.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.810
Look, we don't want to disturb black shawn's nap.

22:08.850 --> 22:12.290
- We got a big game wednesday night.
- God forbid we wake up black shawn.

22:12.310 --> 22:13.470
You know, are you ever gonna stop whining about this?

22:13.510 --> 22:14.930
I'm not whining!
I'm just sayin'.

22:14.970 --> 22:16.710
Look, I'm ranking officer here.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.770
We draw short straw to find out who's on pecker patrol.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.480
- Ok, you got 4 straws.
- Yeah?

22:21.520 --> 22:22.860
So you're not- you're not drawing?

22:22.890 --> 22:24.940
Did you not hear me when I said I'm ranking officer here?

22:24.980 --> 22:26.640
The chain of command exists for a reason.

22:26.680 --> 22:31.470
Now, whoever draws the short straw goes lookin' for feinberg's long straw.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.290
Stupid, you draw first.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.550
- Aw, shit.
- Long straw. Long straw.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.340
- Franco.
- Why does he get to go?

22:48.370 --> 22:50.970
- 'Cause he's franco.
- All right.

22:52.290 --> 22:54.600
- Oh. Yes!
- Shit.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.820
Leslie.

22:55.850 --> 22:58.150
- Oh, you mean G.Money.
- Pardon?

22:58.190 --> 23:01.460
Yeah, leslie wants to be called G.Money.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.550
Leslie.

23:02.580 --> 23:03.660
I don't know what the hell he's talkin' about.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.960
You know, you pick the long straw, "g,"

23:06.990 --> 23:08.830
your life becomes a living hell.

23:08.850 --> 23:09.810
I know.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.690
Except my wife's disappeared off the face of the earth,

23:11.730 --> 23:13.320
and I'm livin' at mike's mom's house,

23:13.360 --> 23:15.690
and you guys are callin' me leslie, so

23:15.720 --> 23:17.890
hell would be a vacation, ok?

23:19.480 --> 23:21.510
Ah, yes!

23:23.320 --> 23:24.110
Nice.

23:24.160 --> 23:24.710
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.860
- Chief, how are you?
- What's goin' on?

23:28.930 --> 23:31.000
The hunt begins.

23:31.020 --> 23:32.240
Good luck.

23:36.300 --> 23:37.770
- Hey.
- Hello, tom.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.390
How you doin'?

23:44.530 --> 23:46.590
Hear you got a new kid at home. Mazel tov.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.880
Ah.
Yeah.

23:47.910 --> 23:49.550
Gesundheit.

23:49.580 --> 23:52.360
Bet you he's a great-lookin' kid, looks like his daddy, huh?

23:52.390 --> 23:54.510
Spitting image.

23:57.830 --> 23:59.060
- What's his name?
- Huh?

23:59.090 --> 24:01.070
- His name.
- The baby.

24:01.100 --> 24:06.360
Uh, long story. I mean, we-we haven't, uh- we are, um,

24:06.390 --> 24:09.400
tryin' to, uh-have a big family, and, uh,

24:09.430 --> 24:11.440
tryin' to be politically correct, so we don't pick a name,

24:11.470 --> 24:14.980
it just kind of pisses, you know, one person off, and-

24:15.020 --> 24:16.570
Listen, what's in a name, right?

24:16.610 --> 24:17.660
Yeah.
Right.

24:17.710 --> 24:21.890
Hey, um, I'm taking some of the guys out to arthur's tonight for a,

24:21.950 --> 24:24.390
like a burger and a beer. You wanna join us?

24:24.430 --> 24:26.920
I- you know, I gotta go over lists of name-

24:26.950 --> 24:30.010
baby name lists with the wife, but maybe I'll come over after.

24:30.050 --> 24:33.300
Oh.
You ok?

24:33.340 --> 24:34.590
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

24:34.630 --> 24:36.400
- Hang loose.
- Ok.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.720
Oh, jesus

24:41.750 --> 24:43.190
I mean, just because the closet's locked,

24:43.230 --> 24:44.980
doesn't mean he's hidin' anything in there, you know?

24:45.030 --> 24:46.700
Maybe it's travolta.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.560
I'm sure it's just his mother's old stuff.

24:48.630 --> 24:49.690
Try and pick the lock?

24:49.730 --> 24:51.010
Yeah, several times.

24:51.070 --> 24:53.320
Except, he's always home.
He doesn't let me in the house by myself.

24:53.370 --> 24:55.250
That's probably because he's afraid of you sticking, like,

24:55.290 --> 24:58.280
a fork in a wall socket or playing with matches or somethin'.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.510
Well, I don't know, but i gotta see what's in the closet.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.630
Well, we know it ain't him, that's for sure.

25:02.690 --> 25:04.070
Here's what you do.

25:04.110 --> 25:05.860
You steal his house keys from his locker.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.460
On those keys, you'll most likely find the closet key, right?

25:09.230 --> 25:12.110
What you do, take it down to the hardware store, get a few copies made.

25:12.150 --> 25:14.050
The next time he goes out, you leave with him,

25:14.090 --> 25:15.910
but just wait for a little while.

25:15.950 --> 25:18.130
Go back. Let yourself in.
He'll never know you were there.

25:18.170 --> 25:20.470
- Mystery solved.
- Heh.

25:20.510 --> 25:21.840
Yeah. Why didn't i think of that?

25:21.870 --> 25:23.720
Oh, come on, shawn.
What do you want, a list?

25:23.770 --> 25:26.110
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

25:26.170 --> 25:27.130
- What's up, t?
- Hey, T.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.670
What's goin' on?

25:28.700 --> 25:31.390
Not much.

25:32.160 --> 25:34.960
Hey, uh, you dropped your mini bible at the gym the other day.

25:34.980 --> 25:36.200
Thanks, man.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.820
It's not a bible.

25:37.850 --> 25:41.050
Like an A.A.Thing, right?

25:43.140 --> 25:44.620
It's all good, man.

25:44.660 --> 25:46.790
We-we all gotta have something to pray to.

25:46.810 --> 25:48.530
We all need a bible.

25:48.550 --> 25:51.510
Yeah, well, let me clue you in on a little bit of somethin' with the bible.

25:51.540 --> 25:55.480
The bible is to the catholic church like the godfather is to the mafia, you know?

25:56.170 --> 25:59.240
Yeah. Catholic church is the most corrupt organization on the face of the planet.

25:59.310 --> 26:02.550
I did 12 years in that penal system, you know.

26:02.590 --> 26:05.050
All these gangsters who walk around thinkin' that they, uh,

26:05.080 --> 26:06.970
run the world at any given moment in time, like

26:07.020 --> 26:10.430
gotti, gambino, castellano, whoever.

26:10.470 --> 26:13.740
They, uh, all learned the same lesson, which is at any given moment in time,

26:13.780 --> 26:16.500
the biggest gangster on this planet is always the pope.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.180
Whatever, man.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.150
Well, what are you?

26:20.670 --> 26:22.500
Baptist?

26:22.530 --> 26:24.590
- Muslim?
- Well, that's my business, all right?

26:24.630 --> 26:26.070
I'm just trying to give you your book back,

26:26.160 --> 26:28.050
so I don't wanna get into a whole religious argument here.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.570
I'm not gettin' into an argument with you, man, but if you want to get into a discussion,

26:30.610 --> 26:33.090
I mean the best place in the world to have a discussion about anything is a firehouse.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.010
- There's nothin' sacred here.
- Well, it is to me.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.800
I got my beliefs, and

26:36.880 --> 26:40.370
you got whatever it is you have, which don't sound like much.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.680
You know what?
Let me tell you somethin'.

26:42.710 --> 26:45.300
If you were workin' the morning of 9/11, you'd feel the same way as me, ok?

26:45.320 --> 26:46.610
I don't care who you believe in,

26:46.650 --> 26:48.320
whether it's god or allah or

26:48.360 --> 26:50.260
mohammed or L.Ron hubbard, ok?

26:50.300 --> 26:51.950
Whoever was supposed to be in charge that morning,

26:52.020 --> 26:54.850
who was managing the master plan, he showed his cards that morning.

26:54.890 --> 26:56.210
He doesn't give a shit, ok?

26:56.240 --> 26:58.670
Oh, you're the only one that was affected by 9/11?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.140
No, I- 9/11 changed me, too.

27:00.180 --> 27:01.140
Oh, yeah?
How did it change-

27:01.180 --> 27:02.670
Shut up.
That's why I'm here.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.140
That's the whole reason I joined up.

27:04.170 --> 27:05.050
- Oh, really
- Yeah.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.950
Oh, so you-you want- you want to be a hero?

27:06.980 --> 27:08.610
Yeah.
I do.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.340
Don't we all?

27:15.870 --> 27:17.510
You believe this kid?

27:17.540 --> 27:19.400
Jesus christ.

27:19.420 --> 27:22.730
How much seniority I have over him, and he's talkin' to me like that?

27:22.750 --> 27:24.560
I wish jerry was here to just see

27:24.600 --> 27:27.070
the kind of shit you guys are tryin' to pull off with this basketball crap.

27:27.110 --> 27:29.620
He'd shut the whole basketball thing down.

27:30.790 --> 27:33.230
Probies get treated like probies for a reason, ok?

27:33.300 --> 27:38.270
They get treated like shit so they can earn our trust and respect, right?

27:38.290 --> 27:41.500
Then we know we can trust 'em in a goddamn fire!

27:41.530 --> 27:43.020
Assholes.

27:43.050 --> 27:46.790
That's why he should be moppin' the floor instead of you, shithead.

27:46.810 --> 27:49.030
Yeah.

27:50.690 --> 27:53.230
Kiss my bony, white, irish ass.

27:56.210 --> 27:57.290
That's gin.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.050
Hey, sailor.

28:12.080 --> 28:13.730
Midlife crisis much?

28:13.760 --> 28:17.640
Oh, shit, I don't need to reach midlife to have a crisis.

28:17.680 --> 28:19.560
That kicked in around the time I lost my virginity.

28:19.590 --> 28:20.850
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:20.890 --> 28:23.620
I do not know who the ding-dong was that said that, uh,

28:23.660 --> 28:25.600
material possessions couldn't buy you happiness,

28:25.640 --> 28:29.810
but I know for a fact he did not own a porsche.

28:29.830 --> 28:31.860
New car, new apartment, new clothes-

28:31.900 --> 28:33.360
- New baby?
- no.

28:33.400 --> 28:33.920
No, don'T.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.290
I love him.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.820
- I love him so much.
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:36.850 --> 28:38.190
I know I only met him that once,

28:38.230 --> 28:41.710
but I swear to god I love that little guy, and I know that he loves me.

28:41.750 --> 28:44.280
And the way things are goin' with you and janet...

28:44.300 --> 28:48.080
I am his best bet at a normal and happy childhood,

28:48.120 --> 28:50.190
and I swear to god there would be no strings attached.

28:50.210 --> 28:50.960
Oh, really?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.740
No, look, tommy, I set the table for you once,

28:53.780 --> 28:55.030
and you didn't want to sit down.

28:55.060 --> 28:55.440
Yeah.

28:55.490 --> 28:57.010
All right, I'm not gonna embarrass myself again.

28:57.050 --> 28:59.390
All that stuff, it's in the past.

28:59.430 --> 29:02.920
I'm over it. This is about what is best for the child.

29:02.970 --> 29:05.600
Yeah, what about what's-his-name?

29:05.620 --> 29:06.660
Not so much.

29:06.690 --> 29:08.510
Oh, you dumped him.

29:09.690 --> 29:11.930
He's a little obsessed.

29:11.970 --> 29:13.420
- With?
- You.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.160
He has a shrine of you in his bedroom.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.520
A shrine?

29:18.560 --> 29:22.710
Yeah, like pictures and articles and candles and, uh,

29:22.740 --> 29:25.030
oh, yeah-heh heh. Heh heh.

29:25.070 --> 29:27.520
Your sunglasses and your remote control.

29:27.550 --> 29:29.540
Oh, so that's where that stuff went.

29:31.060 --> 29:32.650
- Eww.
- What?

29:32.740 --> 29:34.580
You totally like this.
You're so gross.

29:34.630 --> 29:35.520
- Look, this isn'T...
- I like it?

29:35.550 --> 29:37.410
Some kind of man crush, tommy.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.910
This is like travis bickle, "you talking to me," shit.

29:39.920 --> 29:40.910
He's got a total screw loose.

29:40.930 --> 29:42.920
Oh, yeah, like he's the only one.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.010
- I'm sorry?
- Let me tell you something.

29:44.030 --> 29:46.560
If I was even vaguely interested in givin' that kid to anybody,

29:46.590 --> 29:48.750
I'm not gonna give it to somebody who's been lying incessantly to me

29:48.780 --> 29:50.450
for god knows how long.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.770
- What did I lie to you about?
- Oh ho. You want a list?

29:52.800 --> 29:53.820
- Yeah.
- Yeah?Ok.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.050
Well, let's start off with my cock.

29:56.070 --> 29:59.730
Ok?Do you have any idea what that lie did to my wiring, huh?

29:59.760 --> 30:02.450
Why are you assuming that it was me that lied?

30:02.470 --> 30:07.020
Listen, I know that you couldn't get it up the first night with nona.

30:07.050 --> 30:08.280
What?
Who told you that?

30:08.310 --> 30:10.860
Nona told troy, and troy told me.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.210
So what does she do the second night?

30:13.230 --> 30:15.080
She plays to your ego and tells you,

30:15.100 --> 30:17.820
"oh, my god. You had such a raging hard-on in the fire,"

30:17.870 --> 30:20.760
which, by the way, is ridiculous, because you were unconscious.

30:20.780 --> 30:24.790
Maybe I was havin' a dream about heidi klum or-or-what?

30:24.810 --> 30:28.790
All women play mind games about sex.

30:28.810 --> 30:31.920
So when you told me that I was the-the best...

30:32.360 --> 30:34.570
Depends on the night.

30:35.180 --> 30:39.850
When-that time you told me that I-I lasted the longest?

30:40.550 --> 30:43.210
Also depends on the night.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.850
And the whole thing about me being the biggest?

30:46.870 --> 30:51.020
Oh, well, that part was true.

30:53.530 --> 30:55.930
See how easy that is?

30:57.280 --> 31:00.530
These I need.
That he can keep.

31:00.560 --> 31:01.970
Call you later.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.420
Ok.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.870
This is so awesome.

31:18.050 --> 31:20.040
- Thanks a lot, mr. Gavin.
- Yeah.

31:20.070 --> 31:22.430
The other bed was giving us both scoliosis.

31:24.580 --> 31:27.600
Scoliosis. Yeah, that's a good name for a band.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.880
No.

31:28.910 --> 31:31.920
Yeah, sure, heavy metal band, you know, scoliosis.

31:32.940 --> 31:35.460
Heavy metal when, the eighties?

31:35.480 --> 31:38.140
It's like, "yeah!Scoliosis. "

31:38.170 --> 31:39.220
It's heavy metal.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.480
I mean, does it really matter what year it is?

31:40.510 --> 31:42.500
It beats the shit out of fake baby head.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.000
Hey, people love fake baby head.

31:44.020 --> 31:46.760
Well, people loved three dog night, too, so...

31:47.160 --> 31:49.350
- Three dog night?
- Yeah.

31:49.370 --> 31:51.270
That's a cool name for a band.

31:53.260 --> 31:55.060
don't you think?

31:55.810 --> 31:58.290
Yeah.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.240
All right, why don't you go get the pillows.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.540
Ok?

32:10.720 --> 32:13.930
Ok, you know what?I know he's your boyfriend, and that's fine.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.240
Can you tell him not to nuzzle your belly or-

32:17.260 --> 32:19.450
Yeah, any stuff like that when I'm here, ok?

32:19.470 --> 32:20.800
- Jesus.
- Fine.

32:20.830 --> 32:22.810
Creepy.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.350
You look like shit.

32:25.380 --> 32:27.370
- Oh, thank you.
- Wanna sit down?

32:28.150 --> 32:30.010
I'll...

32:36.300 --> 32:39.990
So, uh, mom sounds weird.

32:41.180 --> 32:42.840
Katy, too.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.420
Weirder than usual.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.620
What's going on over there?

32:47.630 --> 32:49.520
Nothing.
It's-you know.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.330
The baby. She's not sleepin' a lot. You know, it's just...

32:52.360 --> 32:54.230
fine.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.830
We miss you, obviously.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.600
- I've been calling.
- I know you've been calling.

32:59.630 --> 33:03.200
You call because you have to call, but I'm just saying in general, it's-

33:03.230 --> 33:06.670
you know, it's a little empty around there without you.

33:06.700 --> 33:09.480
You don't even know me, dad.
How you can you say that?

33:09.500 --> 33:12.680
Aw, christ.
Don't give me that crap.

33:12.710 --> 33:15.970
I- I changed your diapers, ok?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.220
Nobody knows you better than I do.

33:19.260 --> 33:22.310
What's my favorite color?

33:23.050 --> 33:24.780
What's my favorite color?

33:24.800 --> 33:27.220
What's this gonna prove?

33:27.240 --> 33:28.730
What's my favorite food?

33:28.760 --> 33:32.410
I know what your favorite food is.
Cheeseburgers. Cheeseburgers and fries.

33:32.460 --> 33:33.840
- What?
- Ok.

33:33.860 --> 33:34.970
That's your favorite food.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.940
Yeah, dad, when I was, like, 7.

33:36.950 --> 33:38.090
This is what I'm talkin' about. I can't win,

33:38.120 --> 33:39.130
because you're gonna keep saying-

33:39.170 --> 33:42.420
- Favorite band.
- Fake baby head.

33:43.790 --> 33:46.840
- It's not?
- Good-bye, dad.

33:46.860 --> 33:48.240
Well...

33:48.270 --> 33:50.550
Ok, thanks for the bed.

33:53.270 --> 33:56.950
Just like your mother.

33:56.980 --> 33:58.250
Orange.

33:58.290 --> 34:00.000
Ok, I know for a fact that that was your favorite color

34:00.030 --> 34:01.200
when you were, like, 8 years old.

34:01.230 --> 34:02.920
Shirt.
Take a look at your shirt.

34:02.950 --> 34:06.585
Yeah.
Orange. No.

34:06.620 --> 34:09.239
Just do me a favor.
Don't- don't get pregnant, ok?

34:09.270 --> 34:10.710
Ok, dad.

34:13.190 --> 34:15.070
- Reading minds.
- Yeah.

34:15.090 --> 34:18.469
- Don't be a stranger.
- Ok. Bye.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.639
So, uh, I'll see you in a few hours?

Gay parents.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.320
- Get out.

37:28.350 --> 37:32.150
Found these pictures in the back of the closet, padlocked closet.

37:32.170 --> 37:34.890
- Holy toledo.
- Oh, my god.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.300
This explains so much.

37:36.330 --> 37:40.260
Goddamn. How could the poor kid's life be any more of a disaster?

37:40.660 --> 37:44.050
It's funny that- funny that you should say that, 'cause I actually, uh-

37:46.790 --> 37:48.380
I set his mom's house on fire.

You did what?

37:49.050 --> 37:50.820
I- I-set his mom's house on fire.

37:50.850 --> 37:52.800
What do you mean, like- like a grease fire?

37:52.830 --> 37:55.200
No, no.
Like a fire fire.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.900
You mean like a fire fire fire?

37:56.920 --> 37:58.100
Yeah, yeah. Like a-

37:58.140 --> 38:00.650

38:00.700 --> 38:03.300
and I didn't know what to do, so I-I called it in, and I ran.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.700
- I ran away.
- You ran?!

38:06.530 --> 38:08.400
That's what any good fireman would do.

38:08.430 --> 38:11.350
You ran away?

38:12.240 --> 38:15.290
If he finds out, he's gonna kill me.

Get up.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.470
Hey, ken, listen.

39:22.500 --> 39:25.190
The woman has needs, a lot of needs, cuz.

39:25.220 --> 39:27.830
I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.530
I'm the victim here, really.

39:29.550 --> 39:30.510
- Kenny, please, please, please-
- You know what?

39:30.540 --> 39:33.870
You better put some clothes on, 'cause I'm gonna kick you a new ass.

39:33.910 --> 39:35.360
- Oh, you're gonna kick my ass?
- I am.

39:35.380 --> 39:37.220
Why don't you try to kick my ass?

39:37.250 --> 39:38.460
Oh, I'm gonna kick you a new ass.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.050
And I'm gonna do it- and you know what?

39:40.090 --> 39:43.980
You better put some skivvies on, because we're wrestling around,

39:44.010 --> 39:45.720
I don't want your balls to hit me on the forehead.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.330
- I don't want to fight you, kenny.
- Oh, you don't?

39:47.370 --> 39:49.060
Well, you don't have a choice, pal.

39:49.650 --> 39:51.180
Ken, you all right, buddy?

39:51.210 --> 39:52.610
- You ok?
- Oh, honey.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.390
God, if I hurt you, I could never forgive myself.

39:54.430 --> 39:55.280
- Are you all right, man?
- Yeah. I'm ok.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.030
Are you all right?

39:58.220 --> 39:59.690
Yeah, must've been-

39:59.720 --> 40:02.610
I must've left a window open here, 'cause I think I felt a little breeze.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.020
That's what I- ohh.

40:06.340 --> 40:08.210
Oh, yeah.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.300
Tough guy, huh?

40:09.340 --> 40:11.940
Let me tell you, I've been hit-

40:11.970 --> 40:16.030
I've been hit by girl scouts, and it's hurt more than that.

40:16.060 --> 40:17.650
Now I'm gonna show you.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.250
Kenny, are you ok?

40:22.280 --> 40:24.400
Just get out of my house.

40:24.430 --> 40:27.550
Dude, this is a complete misunderstanding.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.770
I understand completely.

40:29.790 --> 40:31.890
You screwed the woman I love.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.800
Now get out.

40:35.820 --> 40:38.530
Fine, if you want to be a dick about it.

40:42.780 --> 40:46.520
Oh, god, that was so unnecessary.

40:52.140 --> 40:56.580
Oh. Hey.
Did I wake you?

40:57.110 --> 40:59.380
What, how long you been, uh, home?

40:59.410 --> 41:01.610
Just a couple minutes.

41:03.110 --> 41:07.450
Baby's asleep, and, uh, katy's doin' some coloring.

41:07.480 --> 41:11.110
She's, uh, all done with her frozen tv dinner,

41:11.150 --> 41:14.000
which is what she had for supper.

41:14.490 --> 41:19.500
I was just, uh, thinking of going out and spending a little time with the guys.

41:20.740 --> 41:22.610
Ok.

41:23.630 --> 41:25.660
What are you doin'?

41:27.380 --> 41:31.080
I, uh-I just had a terrible dream.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.930
Yeah?

41:32.950 --> 41:36.600
I was giving the baby a bath in the tub,

41:36.620 --> 41:39.210
and he started drowning,

41:39.240 --> 41:44.610
and when I reached in to save him, he would just go deeper and deeper.

41:45.620 --> 41:52.210
And then I thought I saw someone in the water underneath the baby.

41:53.610 --> 41:56.370
It was johnny,

41:56.410 --> 41:59.060
and he was pulling the baby down.

41:59.520 --> 42:04.310
He was just staring up at me, and he was laughing.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.460
You know what?

42:09.480 --> 42:11.690
Um, have fun with the guys.

42:13.020 --> 42:15.210
Yeah.

42:15.830 --> 42:17.540
Yeah.

42:18.680 --> 42:22.270
Just, uh, an idea, but if you're thinkin' of cleanin' up,

42:22.300 --> 42:25.310
think a shower's a good idea.

42:59.690 --> 43:02.910
<i>Meditation for the Day</i>

43:07.650 --> 43:15.930
<i>I will relax and not get tense. I will have no fear,</i>
