00:06.969 --> 00:08.769
<i>Last week on Penny Dreadful...</i>

00:08.804 --> 00:10.137
They were trying to kill you.

00:15.144 --> 00:17.478
- It was the Verbis Diablo.
- The word of the Devil.

00:17.480 --> 00:18.880
Should we not begin
by finding a way

00:18.915 --> 00:20.614
to understand the language?

00:20.650 --> 00:22.867
<i>If I do as I have promised you,</i>

00:22.902 --> 00:24.235
<i>give you this thing living,</i>

00:24.287 --> 00:25.486
<i>will you leave me in peace?</i>

00:25.488 --> 00:27.988
You would do better to ask
your soul to leave you.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.891
I'm not what you think I am.
I have blackouts.

00:30.927 --> 00:32.159
<i>What happens?</i>

00:32.211 --> 00:33.994
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>But there's usually blood.</i>

00:34.046 --> 00:35.396
<i>The Ripper back again?</i>

00:35.431 --> 00:37.064
<i>This one is different.</i>

00:37.099 --> 00:38.599
This time there was a survivor.

00:38.634 --> 00:40.034
Name's Warren Roper.

00:40.069 --> 00:42.002
Your daddy says, "Come home,"
so home you come.

00:42.588 --> 00:43.904
Let her live!

00:48.311 --> 00:50.261
<i>Together we've</i>
<i>seen things not of this world</i>

00:50.313 --> 00:52.763
and have proven ourselves
capable of defeating them.

00:52.815 --> 00:54.982
What were they?
You knew their kind.

00:55.017 --> 00:57.685
They are Nightcomers.
Witches.

00:57.737 --> 01:00.421
Our task is made
yet more daunting.

01:00.456 --> 01:03.257
<i>I shall begin by enticing</i>
<i>dear Sir Malcolm.</i>

01:03.292 --> 01:05.759
My old friend Miss Ives
won't escape me.

01:05.795 --> 01:07.194
<i>Here's a woman</i>
<i>who held her ground</i>

01:07.246 --> 01:08.495
<i>against Satan himself.</i>

01:08.531 --> 01:09.997
<i>But now...</i>

01:10.032 --> 01:11.615
<i>I've never seen her frightened.</i>

03:22.665 --> 03:25.966
- Sir Malcolm?
- Come in.

03:35.845 --> 03:37.177
What's happened?

03:43.402 --> 03:45.018
Last night they came to me.

03:47.406 --> 03:50.524
They were there,
as real as you are.

03:50.526 --> 03:52.159
Then...

03:52.194 --> 03:54.078
- They weren't.
- Vanessa.

03:54.113 --> 03:56.747
Is this what it is to go mad?

03:56.782 --> 03:59.333
Your darkest fears made
manifest before your eyes?

03:59.368 --> 04:00.617
You're not a neurotic, Vanessa.

04:00.669 --> 04:03.120
Then tell me
where am I to find peace!

04:03.172 --> 04:05.005
Not even my prayers are safe!

04:06.459 --> 04:08.542
Do you know what that's like?

04:08.594 --> 04:09.710
No.

04:11.013 --> 04:12.930
But I understand the fear
of twisting things

04:12.965 --> 04:14.148
that move at night.

04:28.364 --> 04:30.731
Tell me I deserve peace.

04:30.766 --> 04:32.733
I'm a poor minister for that,
Vanessa.

04:35.121 --> 04:37.204
That's not been my life.

04:39.074 --> 04:40.908
But this I do know.

04:42.578 --> 04:45.546
I'll not leave your side.

04:45.581 --> 04:47.798
Wherever we walk,
we walk together.

04:57.893 --> 05:00.093
I don't know what
I would do without you.

05:04.984 --> 05:06.733
Will you do something for me?

05:07.853 --> 05:09.653
Accompany me somewhere?

05:11.273 --> 05:12.739
Where?

05:14.527 --> 05:16.994
Somewhere I find
a kind of peace.

05:24.537 --> 05:25.619
Can...

05:27.456 --> 05:29.173
Can you understand me?

05:32.995 --> 05:36.964
My... My words might
seem strange to you.

05:39.051 --> 05:40.100
And my face.

05:40.135 --> 05:42.386
Everything is strange to her.

05:45.975 --> 05:47.891
She seems happy enough.

05:49.395 --> 05:50.811
I hope she's
not simple-minded.

05:50.863 --> 05:52.479
She's perfect!

05:58.487 --> 06:00.537
Go slowly.
Give her time.

06:04.593 --> 06:07.094
I want to fill her heart
with poetry.

06:07.129 --> 06:10.414
Let me fill her head
with language first.

06:10.466 --> 06:12.216
Honestly, it will be a process.

06:13.052 --> 06:14.134
You'll understand that.

06:14.169 --> 06:18.222
She must learn the actions
of living anew.

06:18.257 --> 06:19.756
Leave me to it.

06:20.643 --> 06:21.808
I've had experience.

06:21.844 --> 06:23.760
I've waited so long.

06:38.193 --> 06:40.027
She needs poetry.

06:40.062 --> 06:42.412
She needs to eat.
Now go on.

06:42.448 --> 06:44.615
Come back later.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.199
Let me get to it.

06:54.209 --> 06:56.710
If Proteus was
any model to go by,

06:56.762 --> 06:58.845
she'll pick up language quickly.

06:58.881 --> 07:00.601
Even more quickly
since I reduced the trauma

07:00.633 --> 07:03.100
of the electrical charge.

07:03.135 --> 07:04.384
It will come back to her.

07:05.354 --> 07:08.055
So too human interaction and,

07:08.057 --> 07:09.323
well, perhaps memory.

07:11.026 --> 07:13.126
- And then?
- I don't know.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.263
Proteus was just beginning
to regain the memory

07:16.298 --> 07:18.131
of his former life,

07:19.101 --> 07:20.233
when you killed him.

07:20.286 --> 07:23.036
You don't need to
remind me of my sins.

07:24.123 --> 07:26.323
Just never forget your own.

07:27.493 --> 07:28.825
And this?

07:29.995 --> 07:31.578
Creating another sin?

07:31.580 --> 07:33.964
Atoning for your first.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.884
All the love and companionship
you denied me,

07:37.920 --> 07:39.503
visit upon her.

07:41.256 --> 07:43.423
She is our future, Creator.

07:45.561 --> 07:47.260
Tread carefully.

08:58.217 --> 09:00.167
My name is Victor Frankenstein.

09:02.638 --> 09:03.720
Victor.

09:22.825 --> 09:25.066
I suppose it's
a private sort of atonement.

09:25.077 --> 09:29.362
My wife is involved in the
work here and I took it up.

09:30.249 --> 09:31.615
And me?

09:31.667 --> 09:34.034
You're looking
for a kind of peace.

09:34.036 --> 09:37.621
That's a long journey
you must make alone.

09:37.673 --> 09:40.006
But I find a touch of it here.

09:43.078 --> 09:45.912
You must, I'm afraid.
Cholera is rampant here.

09:56.391 --> 09:58.525
How is this meant to help me?

09:58.560 --> 10:00.277
You will see.

10:10.873 --> 10:12.906
Samuel. Thank you.

10:24.670 --> 10:27.637
In the shadow of so
much wealth, such suffering.

11:08.463 --> 11:09.596
You work here?

11:09.631 --> 11:11.298
When I can.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.966
And provide them with funds.

11:14.136 --> 11:16.136
It makes me feel like
I'm a better man.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.378
He'll live, but it was
a close-run thing.

11:41.413 --> 11:42.495
Thankfully, we've learnt a lot

11:42.548 --> 11:44.047
about reconstructive
surgical techniques

11:44.082 --> 11:46.833
with the soldiers returning
from India and the Transvaal.

11:47.502 --> 11:49.386
Terrible wounds there.

11:50.222 --> 11:51.338
I know.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.557
We keep the more disturbing
cases isolated.

11:53.592 --> 11:55.508
Male orderlies only.

12:03.402 --> 12:04.517
Sir.

12:17.532 --> 12:19.165
When will he be able to speak?

12:19.201 --> 12:20.500
Don't know that he will be.

12:20.535 --> 12:22.285
There's not much
of his face left.

12:31.380 --> 12:35.131
Get better, Mr. Roper.
We have much to talk about.

12:36.935 --> 12:38.685
I want to know
who did this to you.

12:47.296 --> 12:48.962
It's all so pretty.

12:48.997 --> 12:51.314
The way the light hits things,
I mean.

12:52.901 --> 12:55.235
There's so much
I don't remember.

12:56.905 --> 12:58.371
That's a result of the accident

12:58.407 --> 13:00.624
that brought you here.

13:00.659 --> 13:02.809
It robbed you
of your memory, you see.

13:04.296 --> 13:05.879
Will it come back?

13:07.249 --> 13:08.798
I don't know.

13:11.003 --> 13:14.971
Your voice is not as I would
have expected.

13:15.007 --> 13:17.590
Well, I sound like you, don't I?

13:17.592 --> 13:20.510
That makes sense, doesn't it?
Us being cousins.

13:21.146 --> 13:22.312
Yes.

13:22.347 --> 13:24.998
- How else should I speak?
- No other way.

13:27.102 --> 13:28.982
Perhaps the accident impacted
your brain in ways

13:28.987 --> 13:30.904
I hadn't anticipated.

13:32.574 --> 13:34.491
It's all very unusual.

13:35.777 --> 13:37.444
You haven't told me.

13:37.996 --> 13:39.112
What's my name?

13:41.867 --> 13:42.949
Lily.

13:45.504 --> 13:46.920
Your name is Lily.

13:49.341 --> 13:51.508
The flower of resurrection
and rebirth.

13:53.428 --> 13:55.512
Why does that make me sad?

13:57.132 --> 13:59.516
Why should a flower make me sad?

14:01.770 --> 14:03.803
I don't understand.

14:03.855 --> 14:06.523
The words come out,
but with so little meaning.

14:09.194 --> 14:11.611
Shh. Be still.

14:14.149 --> 14:15.899
It will take time.

14:17.035 --> 14:18.785
But you'll learn.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.240
I'll show you what life is.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.293
Cousin, teach me.

14:28.213 --> 14:30.046
I am at your mercy.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.299
I shall.

14:44.179 --> 14:46.479
I've an appointment with our
friend at the British Museum.

14:46.515 --> 14:49.099
And then some errands.
Would you like to come?

14:50.018 --> 14:51.684
I'll stay for a bit.

14:53.321 --> 14:54.354
And, Sir Malcolm.

14:56.291 --> 14:57.357
Thank you.

14:57.859 --> 14:59.359
I'll see you at home.

15:00.612 --> 15:03.196
- You'll be back before dark?
- Of course.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.399
Would you like some soup?

15:40.235 --> 15:41.568
Ma'am?

15:42.404 --> 15:43.903
Would you like some soup?

15:45.774 --> 15:47.457
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

15:49.995 --> 15:51.661
May I sit with you?

15:54.749 --> 15:56.166
Yes, ma'am.

16:00.155 --> 16:02.255
I can't speak to the quality.

16:04.426 --> 16:05.758
It's fine, ma'am.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.761
My name is Vanessa Ives.
And it's "Miss."

16:10.098 --> 16:11.564
Miss Ives.

16:13.852 --> 16:15.268
My name is

16:16.188 --> 16:17.570
John Clare.

16:19.074 --> 16:20.140
Mr. Clare.

16:24.946 --> 16:26.379
They make me nervous.

16:26.414 --> 16:27.580
Who?

16:28.416 --> 16:29.833
The nuns.

16:30.418 --> 16:31.618
Why?

16:32.954 --> 16:35.455
I was raised in the faith.
It was arduous for me.

16:36.875 --> 16:38.758
Have you religion?

16:38.793 --> 16:41.127
- Are you offering it?
- Do you require it?

16:41.163 --> 16:44.531
- I never have.
- Then I shan't offer.

16:44.599 --> 16:47.066
And I would be a poor advocate.

16:47.102 --> 16:49.936
The Almighty and I have
a challenging past.

16:49.971 --> 16:51.771
Not sure we're speaking
these days.

16:55.110 --> 16:58.728
I read the Bible
when I was younger. But...

16:59.898 --> 17:02.232
Then I discovered Wordsworth

17:02.284 --> 17:04.200
and the old

17:04.236 --> 17:06.869
platitudes and parables
seemed anemic.

17:08.455 --> 17:10.707
Even unnecessary.

17:10.742 --> 17:12.925
Mr. Wordsworth has
a lot to answer for, then.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.334
Is it not this, Miss Ives,

17:24.339 --> 17:27.674
the glory of life
surmounts the fear of death.

17:28.510 --> 17:30.226
Good Christians

17:30.262 --> 17:32.645
fear hellfire,

17:32.681 --> 17:35.982
so to avoid it, they are kind
to their fellow man.

17:36.818 --> 17:39.852
Good pagans
do not have this fear,

17:39.854 --> 17:42.322
so they can be who they are,

17:42.357 --> 17:45.024
good or ill,
as their nature dictates.

17:47.279 --> 17:49.245
We have no fear of God,

17:50.699 --> 17:52.949
so we are accountable
to no one but each other.

17:54.703 --> 17:57.420
That's a
profound responsibility.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.756
And why you do this, no doubt.

18:01.626 --> 18:03.543
Helping those in need.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.047
I came here for selfish reasons.

18:11.186 --> 18:14.654
Do you truly not
believe in heaven?

18:14.689 --> 18:17.523
I believe in this world

18:17.559 --> 18:20.226
and those creatures
that fill it.

18:20.228 --> 18:22.729
That's always been
enough for me.

18:24.149 --> 18:25.615
Look around you.

18:27.235 --> 18:29.569
Sacred mysteries at every turn.

18:30.872 --> 18:34.407
But no exaltation in life
beyond this?

18:36.044 --> 18:40.079
"To see a world
in a grain of sand

18:40.131 --> 18:43.883
And a heaven in a wild flower

18:45.804 --> 18:48.721
Hold infinity in the palm
of your hand

18:49.808 --> 18:52.258
And eternity in an hour"

18:54.195 --> 18:56.729
With respect to Blake,

18:56.765 --> 19:00.900
I see no wild flowers here,
only pain and suffering.

19:01.569 --> 19:03.736
Then you need to look closer.

19:05.173 --> 19:07.974
You are required, Miss Ives.

19:08.009 --> 19:10.276
Yes. In a moment.

19:15.784 --> 19:17.450
Duty calls.

19:19.454 --> 19:22.171
I'm not used to working
like this.

19:22.207 --> 19:24.290
Those ridiculous little shoes
are agonizing.

19:27.962 --> 19:29.962
Thank you for the soup.

19:30.015 --> 19:32.348
Thank you for the conversation.

19:38.857 --> 19:40.523
You have beautiful eyes.

20:11.256 --> 20:12.939
I hope that's your sister.

20:14.509 --> 20:17.143
- I'm sorry?
- Your sister, I hope.

20:17.178 --> 20:18.845
Don't tell me your wife.

20:18.897 --> 20:21.931
Oh, no. A friend.

20:22.901 --> 20:24.183
You could see how I
could make the mistake.

20:24.185 --> 20:25.752
I mean, you look very similar.

20:25.787 --> 20:29.922
The pale skin, the dark hair,
fully intoxicating eyes...

20:29.958 --> 20:31.691
If you don't mind my boldness.

20:31.693 --> 20:33.126
I live to shock, I think.

20:35.113 --> 20:36.496
You know, I try to stop myself,

20:36.531 --> 20:38.331
but I just can't.

20:38.366 --> 20:40.032
Well, I don't try that hard.

20:43.088 --> 20:44.670
My name is Dorian Gray.

20:45.590 --> 20:48.875
Angelique. No last name.

20:48.927 --> 20:50.960
Utterly mysterious,
don't you think?

20:51.012 --> 20:52.428
I don't know what to think.

20:52.464 --> 20:53.946
Probably best.

20:53.982 --> 20:57.133
Thinking would age you terribly.

20:57.185 --> 21:00.586
It's best you stay beautiful
and a bit simple.

21:00.622 --> 21:01.554
Oh.

21:01.606 --> 21:04.090
You are beautiful,
did you know that?

21:04.125 --> 21:05.958
I've been thought so.

21:05.994 --> 21:07.527
Don't be coy.

21:07.562 --> 21:10.646
I tried coyness once,
couldn't carry it off.

21:10.698 --> 21:12.064
I can imagine.

21:12.066 --> 21:15.568
I saw you sitting here
and I thought to myself...

21:19.941 --> 21:21.491
Well,

21:21.543 --> 21:23.626
I like to be
around beautiful things.

21:23.661 --> 21:24.994
You should see my bedroom.

21:25.046 --> 21:27.130
Swags and chintz
to choke a horse,

21:28.133 --> 21:30.416
and I've choked my fair share.

21:32.220 --> 21:34.387
Would you like to see
my bedroom?

21:34.422 --> 21:35.505
It's close.

21:37.392 --> 21:38.691
I'm sorry.
Not today.

21:41.346 --> 21:42.762
Is it her?

21:43.932 --> 21:45.481
The girl in the photograph?

21:45.517 --> 21:47.316
Did she break your heart?

21:48.853 --> 21:51.487
Such as it is, she broke it.

21:52.407 --> 21:53.606
I'm sorry.

21:54.742 --> 21:56.943
I had my heart broken once.

21:56.995 --> 22:00.112
But not as a child, as a woman.

22:01.032 --> 22:03.583
A true pain that was.
I swore to myself,

22:03.618 --> 22:04.867
never again.

22:05.453 --> 22:07.420
Did you keep your oath?

22:08.156 --> 22:09.422
Yes.

22:10.391 --> 22:13.960
And my life is sadder
because of it.

22:17.632 --> 22:19.632
If you should ever want
to mend your heart,

22:20.468 --> 22:21.801
this is where I work.

22:27.308 --> 22:28.641
And your heart?

22:29.978 --> 22:31.143
Waiting.

22:33.815 --> 22:35.648
Stay young and beautiful,
Dorian Gray.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.233
It suits you.

23:17.859 --> 23:19.659
Mrs. Poole.

23:19.694 --> 23:23.079
Sir Malcolm.
What a surprise.

23:27.869 --> 23:29.869
Where will it end?

23:29.871 --> 23:32.705
This rush to embrace
all things mechanized.

23:33.508 --> 23:35.174
You don't favor
the modern conveniences?

23:35.209 --> 23:37.426
No, I am a Luddite at heart,
pitching gears and cogs

23:37.462 --> 23:38.878
into the river willy-nilly.

23:40.598 --> 23:42.131
No, I favor the old ways.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.050
I was much the same.

23:44.052 --> 23:47.753
But one loses relevance if one
doesn't change with the times.

23:47.789 --> 23:49.388
What change do you seek here?

23:49.424 --> 23:51.223
A gift for Miss Ives, in fact.

23:51.276 --> 23:52.892
Ah, dear Miss Ives.

23:53.811 --> 23:55.645
And it's scent for me.

23:55.697 --> 23:57.897
I'm trying to decide.

23:57.899 --> 24:00.232
A man's opinion is advisable.

24:00.285 --> 24:02.368
- Will you help me?
- If I'm able.

24:05.239 --> 24:08.157
This is my old scent.

24:08.710 --> 24:09.992
I want something new.

24:11.212 --> 24:13.579
- Very nice.
- "Very nice."

24:13.581 --> 24:15.131
Such a man.

24:15.166 --> 24:16.999
Like you charge by the word.

24:18.553 --> 24:19.635
Here.

24:20.254 --> 24:21.754
To clean your palate.

24:32.817 --> 24:34.066
Also very nice.

24:38.156 --> 24:39.822
Now, this is my choice.

24:41.776 --> 24:42.908
I think.

24:44.495 --> 24:47.196
I sense something
of the old days in it.

24:48.499 --> 24:52.118
The old days,
the days before now.

24:54.422 --> 24:57.289
When the old gods
walked the Earth.

25:29.457 --> 25:32.825
- What do you think?
- I like that one.

25:34.128 --> 25:35.494
I thought you might.

25:40.802 --> 25:41.917
Yes?

25:43.471 --> 25:44.920
Our guest has arrived.

25:54.432 --> 25:55.514
Mr. Lyle.

25:56.984 --> 25:58.184
Miss Ives!

25:58.853 --> 26:00.236
Our lamentable separation

26:00.271 --> 26:02.238
has trebled my pleasure
at seeing you again.

26:02.273 --> 26:03.856
My heart shall burst.

26:05.026 --> 26:06.776
This is Mr. Ethan Chandler.

26:07.245 --> 26:08.577
Mr. Chandler!

26:09.781 --> 26:12.832
You are so very tall.
You render me Lilliputian.

26:12.867 --> 26:14.033
Hello, Mr. Lyle.

26:14.118 --> 26:16.569
American! I am undone.

26:18.372 --> 26:19.455
Shall we?

26:22.927 --> 26:24.710
Given you're an expert
in dead languages,

26:24.712 --> 26:26.712
we thought to
appeal for your help.

26:27.348 --> 26:28.380
So we're to have another

26:28.382 --> 26:30.299
adventure in translation,
are we?

26:30.351 --> 26:32.218
Brazen our way
into the mystic past?

26:32.220 --> 26:33.269
If you're willing.

26:33.304 --> 26:35.554
I feel Mr. Chandler
can provide able rescue

26:35.606 --> 26:36.639
should we find ourselves

26:36.691 --> 26:38.190
suddenly afoul of the odd glyph.

26:38.226 --> 26:40.226
- Well, I do have a gun belt.
- Stop.

26:41.979 --> 26:44.063
Ah, the good doctor.

26:44.065 --> 26:45.531
How many adventurers
are we, then?

26:45.566 --> 26:47.066
This completes our company.

26:47.118 --> 26:50.119
I'm glad. Mischief is best
enacted in small groups

26:50.154 --> 26:52.538
at very close quarters,
don't you think, Mr. Chandler?

26:52.573 --> 26:53.906
Sorry I'm late.

26:53.908 --> 26:56.208
Mr. Ferdinand Lyle,
Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

26:57.495 --> 27:01.247
- How do you do?
- Doctor. Charmed.

27:01.249 --> 27:02.548
So you're the chappy
who's going to translate

27:02.583 --> 27:04.300
the mythical language?

27:04.335 --> 27:06.352
Not so mythical as you think,
young man.

27:07.338 --> 27:09.421
The Verbis Diablo,
the Devil's tongue,

27:09.474 --> 27:11.724
has roots as old as Aramaic,

27:11.759 --> 27:13.259
and likely much older.

27:14.095 --> 27:16.228
It was an oral tradition
for the most part,

27:16.264 --> 27:18.364
like most now-dead languages.

27:18.399 --> 27:21.517
We haven't entirely lost it,
we've just forgotten it.

27:21.569 --> 27:23.903
And if I were to tell you
it's spoken now?

27:24.605 --> 27:25.855
In London?

27:28.326 --> 27:32.161
I should express surprise,
but not complete bafflement.

27:32.196 --> 27:34.830
Note I said it was an oral
tradition for the most part.

27:34.866 --> 27:39.251
There is one written example
of the language.

27:40.538 --> 27:42.037
Relics of a sort.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.290
In a long-forgotten box
deep in the archives

27:44.342 --> 27:45.958
of the British Museum,

27:45.960 --> 27:48.677
and I can't imagine anyone
has looked at them in years.

27:51.132 --> 27:52.965
In the 11th century,

27:54.719 --> 27:59.171
a Carthusian monk known to us
only as Brother Gregory

27:59.941 --> 28:01.807
began to lose his mind.

28:02.975 --> 28:06.202
He said he was possessed
by a demon,

28:06.881 --> 28:09.005
perhaps the father
of all demons,

28:09.473 --> 28:11.875
the fallen angel himself.

28:12.394 --> 28:13.843
In any event,

28:13.845 --> 28:18.098
this demon spoke to him
in the Verbis Diablo.

28:18.150 --> 28:19.733
Brother Gregory wrote down
what it said

28:19.768 --> 28:21.184
on whatever was to hand.

28:21.186 --> 28:23.853
Having nothing like
science to consult,

28:23.855 --> 28:27.690
his brothers finally
pronounced Brother Gregory mad

28:27.743 --> 28:29.459
and locked him away.

28:29.494 --> 28:31.528
But his lunatic ravings

28:31.530 --> 28:33.446
are now in the British Museum.

28:33.498 --> 28:35.365
The only existing
written example

28:35.417 --> 28:37.867
of this seemingly dead language.

28:38.787 --> 28:41.204
If we seek to understand
the Verbis Diablo,

28:41.206 --> 28:43.256
we must start there.

28:43.291 --> 28:46.109
Can you get the relics?
Bring them here?

28:46.337 --> 28:48.344
Oh, yes.

28:48.380 --> 28:50.713
Like most of the plundered
riches of the British Museum,

28:50.766 --> 28:52.932
they are scrupulously ignored.

28:52.968 --> 28:56.302
I'll just plunder them back.

28:56.354 --> 28:58.988
Perhaps Mr. Chandler
could accompany me?

28:59.024 --> 29:00.323
My pleasure, sir.

29:00.358 --> 29:01.891
Will you bring your gun belt?

29:01.927 --> 29:03.193
Both guns.

29:05.233 --> 29:07.163
What happened
to Brother Gregory?

29:07.491 --> 29:09.232
Ah.

29:09.234 --> 29:10.617
Locked away by his brothers,

29:10.652 --> 29:13.369
the visitations from the demon
did not abate.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.990
They were deep within him.

29:17.042 --> 29:20.477
A curse, if you will.
Seemingly inescapable.

29:22.547 --> 29:23.580
And?

29:23.615 --> 29:26.916
After years of confinement,
and torment,

29:27.780 --> 29:30.503
they were finally convinced
he was not in fact mad,

29:30.555 --> 29:32.472
but possessed by the Devil.

29:34.556 --> 29:36.309
They burned him at the stake.

29:36.344 --> 29:38.094
God love religion.

29:56.948 --> 29:58.281
- Thank you so much.
- Do call again.

29:58.333 --> 29:59.749
Certainly.

30:01.241 --> 30:02.752
May I help you?

30:05.943 --> 30:08.324
May I see Miss Angelique?

30:09.820 --> 30:11.466
But of course.

30:11.980 --> 30:13.696
Come this way, please.

30:20.582 --> 30:22.214
I trust you shan't
be disappointed.

30:22.334 --> 30:23.515
I'm sure not.

30:23.635 --> 30:26.404
Be firm with her.
She is willful.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.561
Like all children.

30:50.823 --> 30:52.622
I hope you know what you bought.

30:53.563 --> 30:55.075
I do.

31:09.524 --> 31:11.389
I should feign modesty, I know.

31:13.394 --> 31:14.399
Your turn.

31:16.882 --> 31:20.192
When you asked for my company
this afternoon, I did not expect this.

31:20.735 --> 31:22.485
Glad I could surprise.

31:22.537 --> 31:24.370
You delighted, Sir Malcolm.

31:25.302 --> 31:28.291
Such the most distracting time
I've had in eons.

31:47.182 --> 31:48.303
Courage, then.

31:48.981 --> 31:50.430
It's pulling to the left a bit.

31:51.700 --> 31:53.767
Always blame the equipment.

31:55.103 --> 31:56.560
Would you like to try a new gun?

31:56.859 --> 31:58.541
Oh, I'll try anything new.

31:59.037 --> 32:00.827
Beside vegetables.

32:01.425 --> 32:03.294
It's made by the Mauser company.

32:03.414 --> 32:04.739
A prototype.

32:05.275 --> 32:07.792
Semi-automatic firing mechanism.

32:08.455 --> 32:10.550
There's nothing else like it on Earth.

32:12.287 --> 32:14.587
Does your wife like shooting?

32:17.876 --> 32:18.958
No.

32:22.681 --> 32:23.847
What does she like?

32:24.799 --> 32:26.232
We're estranged.

32:27.686 --> 32:29.302
Should I pretend sorrow?

32:29.354 --> 32:32.138
Pretend nothing, Mrs. Poole,
it wouldn't become you.

32:33.558 --> 32:35.608
Will you divorce?

32:35.644 --> 32:37.393
That's impossible.

32:38.780 --> 32:41.114
The scandal to her name
would be too great.

32:41.149 --> 32:42.649
I must respect that.

32:46.821 --> 32:48.204
I'm sorry.

32:49.991 --> 32:51.224
A man's gun.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.878
An extension of a man's arm.

32:54.913 --> 32:58.298
Like the bow of an
elegant battleship.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.750
Just so you know, about my wife.

33:01.503 --> 33:04.170
There is no love between us,

33:04.222 --> 33:06.589
not for some time,
if I'm honest.

33:07.726 --> 33:09.342
But I am bound to her.

33:10.178 --> 33:12.478
That is how I must live now,

33:12.514 --> 33:14.309
and in the future.

33:14.429 --> 33:17.734
I appreciate
your honesty, Malcolm.

33:17.769 --> 33:19.852
And it's always good to
have something to aim at.

33:32.867 --> 33:33.917
I've not had the greatest amount

33:33.952 --> 33:36.035
of experience with this.

33:36.087 --> 33:38.371
I'm surprised you've had any.

33:42.294 --> 33:43.793
Is this how you remember me?

33:44.930 --> 33:46.512
Sorry?

33:46.548 --> 33:48.047
When we were young together?

33:48.800 --> 33:49.882
A bit.

33:52.137 --> 33:54.437
They were long summer afternoons

33:55.440 --> 33:57.256
and we were
comrades in great adventures.

33:58.109 --> 34:00.026
Pirates on the Spanish Main

34:00.061 --> 34:02.612
or conquistadors exploring
the New World.

34:06.201 --> 34:07.481
They were happy days, our youth.

34:08.036 --> 34:09.118
We were close?

34:10.487 --> 34:11.621
Very.

34:13.408 --> 34:16.074
When there were thunder storms
you came to my bed.

34:17.045 --> 34:19.245
We never slept.

34:19.246 --> 34:21.047
We clung together
until the storms passed.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.974
Did I admire
fair-haired ladies?

34:32.393 --> 34:33.726
I did.

34:34.596 --> 34:36.145
They always seemed kinder.

34:38.728 --> 34:39.750
Like angels.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.322
You're making me into an angel.

34:47.827 --> 34:49.909
Or maybe just the cousin
you always wanted.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.668
Who was he?

34:57.703 --> 35:00.788
The other man when I awoke.
The strange one.

35:02.625 --> 35:05.509
He was someone you used to know.

35:07.713 --> 35:08.795
Your intended.

35:10.198 --> 35:11.464
To marry?

35:12.534 --> 35:13.733
Yes.

35:14.569 --> 35:15.635
Did I love him?

35:17.639 --> 35:20.006
- I don't know.
- Must I love him now?

35:21.543 --> 35:22.642
That's for you to say.

35:27.399 --> 35:29.115
There's so much
that frightens me.

35:30.319 --> 35:32.352
I don't know how to feel or act.

35:32.387 --> 35:35.739
In the smallest ways even.
How to sit and speak.

35:38.410 --> 35:39.926
Don't let me be hurt.

35:40.545 --> 35:41.828
I won't.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.820
- Mr. Chandler.
- Mr. Lyle.

36:13.910 --> 36:17.194
Come this way. We shall
be out ***.

36:17.247 --> 36:18.746
I'll do my best.

36:23.870 --> 36:25.253
This way.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.372
Have you known
Miss Ives for long?

36:28.374 --> 36:29.473
A fair piece.

36:29.509 --> 36:31.375
Extraordinary sort of woman.

36:32.211 --> 36:33.377
That she is.

36:36.282 --> 36:37.381
Oh!

36:38.434 --> 36:39.717
Mr. Swenson, hello.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.802
This is, um...

36:44.140 --> 36:45.590
My brother.

36:47.026 --> 36:48.759
I promised to show him
our special archives,

36:48.795 --> 36:50.695
as one does, you know.

36:51.631 --> 36:55.199
- As you say, Ferdinand. Sir.
- Sir.

37:02.241 --> 37:03.457
Your brother?

37:03.493 --> 37:05.576
Well, I'm not made
for such skullduggery!

37:05.628 --> 37:08.079
My heart is fluttering
like mad. Feel my pulse.

37:08.131 --> 37:10.131
Now don't swoon on me.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.416
Oh, Mr. Chandler,
how you talk!

37:12.418 --> 37:13.801
But he won't question it.

37:13.836 --> 37:15.720
The British Museum holds
the world's largest collection

37:15.755 --> 37:18.306
of historical pornography,

37:18.341 --> 37:20.808
aside from the Vatican,
of course.

37:21.928 --> 37:24.261
People are always
sneaking in for a look.

37:54.293 --> 37:55.860
Constantinople. G.

37:56.679 --> 37:57.795
G.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.215
What's this?

38:03.386 --> 38:05.019
I'm not a thorough medievalist,

38:05.054 --> 38:07.021
but it's an heraldic family
symbol of some sort.

38:07.807 --> 38:09.940
"So the hounds will protect."

38:12.028 --> 38:13.244
You read Latin!

38:14.313 --> 38:15.396
Was raised with it.

38:15.448 --> 38:16.864
Ah.

38:16.899 --> 38:19.450
A classical education
will always out.

38:19.485 --> 38:23.120
But that's "wolves,"
not "hounds."

38:23.156 --> 38:25.873
On battle shields the heraldic
iconography's not actually

38:25.908 --> 38:29.126
meant to strike terror in
the opponent, as you'd think.

38:29.162 --> 38:31.162
Rather, it's meant
to evoke protection.

38:31.214 --> 38:32.880
The figures are more

38:32.915 --> 38:36.133
spirit guides and totems
of significance to the owner.

38:37.336 --> 38:40.171
Dragons and griffons
and the like.

38:40.223 --> 38:42.006
"So the wolves will protect."

38:42.008 --> 38:43.758
Yes, grisly bit of business.

38:43.810 --> 38:46.177
But that's why they call them
the Dark Ages.

38:46.229 --> 38:48.479
I saw wolves where I grew up,

38:48.514 --> 38:50.598
in the New Mexico Territory.

38:50.650 --> 38:52.316
Timber wolves.

38:52.351 --> 38:53.784
- Enormous things.
- Oh?

38:53.820 --> 38:55.419
They hunted in packs.

38:55.455 --> 38:57.788
They'd isolate a cow
or a sheep or what have you

38:57.824 --> 38:59.240
by barking and growling.

38:59.275 --> 39:01.075
But when they finally attacked,

39:01.861 --> 39:03.527
it was completely silent.

39:05.531 --> 39:06.864
They'd...

39:11.838 --> 39:14.255
They'd tear out
the windpipe first.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.757
You couldn't hear anything,

39:17.677 --> 39:19.593
but the blood splashing
on the ground.

39:22.348 --> 39:24.882
They didn't protect anything.
They just fed.

39:27.103 --> 39:30.087
- What a life you've led.
- Long time ago.

39:30.890 --> 39:31.989
I've found it.

39:34.227 --> 39:35.359
This way.

39:39.398 --> 39:41.949
I researched
my own family crest once.

39:43.069 --> 39:44.568
Distinctly disappointing.

39:46.789 --> 39:49.623
Two interlocking fish
on a field of lavender.

39:51.244 --> 39:52.877
I ask you, fish?

39:55.915 --> 39:56.997
Ah!

40:01.420 --> 40:03.170
Ah!

40:03.222 --> 40:05.923
As I said, forgotten by all.

40:07.176 --> 40:08.809
The Verbis Diablo.

40:29.282 --> 40:30.414
Ooh.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.413
Quiet, Helen. Shh.

41:38.985 --> 41:40.818
Yes. Shh.

41:55.034 --> 41:56.133
Shh, shh, shh.

42:01.674 --> 42:03.507
She's colicky tonight.

42:04.427 --> 42:06.293
- Teething, do you think?
- Mmm.

42:13.552 --> 42:17.554
<i>♪ Dance to your daddy,</i>
<i>my little babbie</i>

42:17.556 --> 42:20.774
<i>♪ Dance to your daddy,</i>
<i>my little lamb</i>

42:21.978 --> 42:24.695
<i>♪ You shall have a fishy</i>
<i>in your little dishy</i>

42:25.698 --> 42:27.481
<i>♪ You shall have a fishy... ♪</i>

42:41.631 --> 42:42.746
Alfred?

43:13.913 --> 43:14.994
I've never absconded

43:14.997 --> 43:16.780
with national treasures before.

43:16.832 --> 43:18.332
Did you have any difficulty?

43:18.367 --> 43:20.034
Oh, it was heart-stopping!

43:20.086 --> 43:21.285
Miss Ives.

43:21.337 --> 43:23.454
Mr. Chandler was heroic,
as you might imagine,

43:23.506 --> 43:24.838
but I like to think
I acquitted myself

43:24.874 --> 43:26.790
with singular vigor.

43:26.792 --> 43:28.125
Born for action, this one.

43:38.938 --> 43:40.304
What are these?

43:41.941 --> 43:44.558
Apparently whatever
Brother Gregory could find

43:44.610 --> 43:47.027
on which to write
the demon's words.

43:52.535 --> 43:53.817
There's Latin here.

43:56.822 --> 43:58.706
And Arabic here.

43:58.741 --> 44:01.158
A veritable Tower of Babel.

44:05.631 --> 44:08.632
Well, who's good at puzzles?

44:13.506 --> 44:14.805
Doctor?

44:15.725 --> 44:17.424
Down here.

44:35.411 --> 44:37.828
Cosmetically,
she is transformed.

44:39.582 --> 44:41.081
Who could recognize
the woman she was?

44:43.619 --> 44:44.785
Yes.

44:49.275 --> 44:50.374
Hello.

44:53.462 --> 44:55.379
- Language came back quickly.
- Her memory?

44:56.015 --> 44:58.265
No. I don't remember you.

45:00.219 --> 45:01.285
We were...

45:03.155 --> 45:04.254
Friends.

45:07.059 --> 45:08.192
Yes.

45:08.978 --> 45:10.527
Will you allow us to meet again?

45:11.480 --> 45:13.297
This may take time.

45:15.768 --> 45:17.935
Be patient with each other.

45:21.740 --> 45:24.208
Lily, may I introduce...

45:28.414 --> 45:29.797
John Clare.

45:31.801 --> 45:33.250
Mr. Clare.

45:59.195 --> 46:03.280
This isn't what you expected,
and I appreciate that.

46:04.834 --> 46:06.867
You thought me a fraud at first,

46:06.919 --> 46:08.702
albeit a terribly good one.

46:09.421 --> 46:11.672
A theatrical spiritualist

46:11.707 --> 46:13.540
beyond compare,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

46:14.677 --> 46:16.760
But then the occultist dabbler

46:17.880 --> 46:20.964
found himself
amongst the real thing.

46:21.016 --> 46:24.184
Now, I needn't remind you
of the consequences

46:24.220 --> 46:27.137
of disloyalty, need I?

46:28.641 --> 46:30.390
All those photographs.

46:31.477 --> 46:34.978
So indiscreet.

46:34.980 --> 46:37.030
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

46:38.150 --> 46:40.150
I just can't imagine what
the Museum Governors

46:40.202 --> 46:41.652
would make of them.

46:42.494 --> 46:44.922
Or the gentlemen of the press.

46:45.908 --> 46:49.593
Well, I can imagine, actually.

46:51.547 --> 46:53.547
First, you'd lose your job.

46:54.633 --> 46:57.034
Then your position in society.

46:57.736 --> 47:00.137
And your wife's money.

47:00.172 --> 47:03.557
Then you'd just be
a sad old sodomite

47:03.592 --> 47:06.944
in too much rouge
and a flamboyant wig.

47:06.979 --> 47:09.680
I'll have you know
my hair is completely real.

47:12.401 --> 47:14.434
Brava.

47:14.486 --> 47:15.569
So.

47:16.405 --> 47:19.089
Regale me.
What do they know?

47:19.124 --> 47:20.490
Nothing.

47:22.027 --> 47:25.579
I can misdirect them
as you see fit.

47:25.614 --> 47:29.116
No. Let her follow
the bread crumbs to me.

47:31.170 --> 47:32.903
And your interest in Miss Ives?

47:32.938 --> 47:35.339
The wicked cunt is
of no concern of yours!

47:38.177 --> 47:40.210
Tell me about him, though.

47:41.380 --> 47:42.879
The man.

47:44.133 --> 47:45.882
- Mr. Chandler?
- Mmm.

47:47.019 --> 47:49.970
Simple, really.
Uncomplicated, I would think.

47:51.690 --> 47:53.223
Like all Americans.

47:58.063 --> 47:59.396
You have it?

48:15.748 --> 48:17.414
Remain, little man.
