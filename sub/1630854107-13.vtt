WEBVTT

00:08.443 --> 00:10.358
MAN [over P.A.]:
Welcome, one and all...

00:10.445 --> 00:12.447
She's a historical landmark.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.710
You don't just up and
move a floating museum.

00:14.797 --> 00:15.841
We need more time.

00:15.972 --> 00:17.191
Well, you're out of time, Sal.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.322
We need this berth cleared.

00:18.409 --> 00:19.976
As I said,
we're working on it.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.238
Well, work faster.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.761
We start
the salvage mission Friday.

00:22.935 --> 00:23.762
Aye, aye, Skipper.

00:23.893 --> 00:24.850
Friday it is.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.635
This isn't
<i>Gilligan's Island,</i>

00:26.809 --> 00:28.637
and I'm a lieutenant.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.598
You have a delivery.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.035
This thing here
for either of you?

00:35.209 --> 00:36.210
Nope.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.689
You have a delivery.

00:37.863 --> 00:38.995
Persistent little fella.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.823
Well, I didn't order anything.

00:40.910 --> 00:44.348
Sorry, buddy, but whatever
you got's not for me.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.264
I think it's gonna
follow you home.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.093
You have a delivery.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.838
Still behind me, huh?

00:56.012 --> 00:57.709
You have a delivery.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.450
Okay, you win.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.191
Just shut up.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.410
If it's a pizza, I get half.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.107
You have a delivery.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.322
Director, you wanted to see me?

01:45.496 --> 01:47.585
Agent Knight, have a seat.

01:47.716 --> 01:50.284
Sir, the only reason why
I parked in your parking spot

01:50.371 --> 01:53.025
on Friday was 'cause I knew
you weren't here.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.462
You parked in my spot on Friday?

01:54.636 --> 01:55.941
No.

01:56.072 --> 02:00.250
What's your take
on Chloe Marlene?

02:00.337 --> 02:02.122
- The actress?
- Mm-hmm.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.689
Her movies aren't really
my cup of tea.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.387
Why?

02:06.561 --> 02:08.563
Ms. Marlene is currently
shooting a film here in D.C.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.739
What's that have to do with me?

02:10.869 --> 02:13.481
She's playing
an NCIS REACT agent,

02:13.568 --> 02:16.223
and to lend authenticity
to her character,

02:16.310 --> 02:17.920
she's requested time
with an expert.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.704
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

02:19.791 --> 02:22.098
This is a joke, right?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.578
I couldn't make this up.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.580
Wow.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.322
I am flattered,
but I will pass.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.759
This isn't a request.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.891
You're ordering me
to hang out with a movie star?

02:32.978 --> 02:34.241
The order's not coming from me.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.503
It's from SECNAV.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.504
Why would

02:36.591 --> 02:38.332
SECNAV get involved?

02:38.462 --> 02:40.203
The movie is
about the Navy,

02:40.377 --> 02:42.684
and since Tom Cruise got to
spend time with a fighter pilot

02:42.771 --> 02:46.775
for <i>Top Gun,</i> SECNAV wants
Ms. Marlene to have access

02:46.949 --> 02:48.907
to the same kind
of expertise.

02:48.994 --> 02:51.954
So I'm doing this
to help sell movie tickets?

02:52.041 --> 02:54.217
Actually, I think
SECNAV's more interested

02:54.348 --> 02:55.958
in the movie boosting recruitment,

02:56.132 --> 02:57.916
but either way,

02:58.003 --> 03:00.919
just try and make the next two
days as painless as possible.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.748
Two days?

03:03.835 --> 03:06.273
That Chloe Marlene here?

03:06.360 --> 03:09.145
Shadowing you
for two whole days?

03:09.276 --> 03:11.408
Pretty much sums it up.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.194
Okay.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.021
Well, now we know
what she looks like.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.936
I'm more concerned
with what she acts like.

03:18.023 --> 03:21.331
She is a big star, so she's
probably high-maintenance.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.767
Yeah, not to
mention needy.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.378
Oh, come on, you guys
don't even know her.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.422
Oh, and you do?

03:25.596 --> 03:27.381
No, but I hear she's

03:27.511 --> 03:29.165
quite a spectacular person.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.601
Nick Torres,

03:30.775 --> 03:33.169
do you have a secret crush
on Chloe Marlene?

03:33.256 --> 03:34.866
No, but when's she getting here?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.738
Oh, why, you need time
to freshen up?

03:37.913 --> 03:40.263
Oh, too late.

03:40.437 --> 03:43.701
Chloe Marlene, meet
Special Agents Tim McGee,

03:43.788 --> 03:44.789
Nick Torres,

03:44.963 --> 03:46.661
and...
Jessica Knight.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.445
Graduated FLETC in '07,

03:48.532 --> 03:50.795
REACT agent for 11 years,
Meritorious Achievement Medal

03:50.882 --> 03:51.579
in '20.

03:51.666 --> 03:52.623
It is an honor to meet you.

03:52.797 --> 03:55.539
Wow, someone came prepared.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.411
Oh, it's the least I could do.

03:57.498 --> 04:00.370
I mean, you're going to help me
find Cheyenne Fuentes.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.763
Is Cheyenne missing?

04:03.852 --> 04:05.201
Uh, no, Timothy.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.116
It's, uh,
Chloe's new character

04:07.203 --> 04:08.639
she's gonna play
in her new film.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.380
I also came prepared.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.077
Oh.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.689
Well, I would love to help you,

04:14.863 --> 04:16.865
but we don't actually have
a case to work right now.

04:16.995 --> 04:17.822
No, I get it.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.389
It's just like Hollywood,
you know.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.130
Hurry up and wait.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.479
Yes, yes,

04:22.653 --> 04:24.916
and speaking
of the industry,

04:25.090 --> 04:27.571
my, uh, middle school
drama teacher, you know,

04:27.658 --> 04:29.269
she watched me
in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>

04:29.443 --> 04:30.661
and she said I'd be a star.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.576
One-Take Torres,
she used to call me.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.099
That's what
she used to call me,

04:34.274 --> 04:37.407
but, uh, I chose
to live in the shadows

04:37.494 --> 04:40.149
instead of the limelight.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.849
Mm, Bandium alert.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.202
- Wow.
- Damn.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.856
McGEE:
Uh, we sure

04:51.943 --> 04:53.249
we want to take Chloe to this?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.772
To what, a dead body?

04:54.859 --> 04:56.861
Nope, no body.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.690
Oh, good, but just so you know,
I did mentally prepare myself,

04:59.864 --> 05:01.910
like, just in case
I have to see real blood.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.348
I hope you're prepared
to see a lot more.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.612
Actually, less.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.578
All right, photo
shoot is over.

05:17.708 --> 05:18.535
You can take the head
out of the robot.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.232
That's a new combination
of words for me.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.496
- Hey, give me a hand here.
- Mm-mm.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.671
Just lift up the bucket.

05:23.758 --> 05:24.976
All right, that I can handle.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.762
All right, victim is
middle-aged male.

05:27.936 --> 05:30.939
Head severed
at the C-3 vertebra,

05:31.113 --> 05:32.288
clean laceration.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.637
Rigor mortis in
the jaw suggests

05:33.724 --> 05:35.465
that he died
within the last 12 hours.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.554
I know we all have
to die somehow,

05:37.641 --> 05:40.557
but this is the worst
of the somehows.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.559
I opened up the lid and...

05:42.733 --> 05:44.344
I was hoping it
was a fake head,

05:44.431 --> 05:45.867
you know, like a sick joke.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.696
Unfortunately not.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.350
I take it
you don't know him?

05:50.524 --> 05:52.482
No, although I'll
never be able to erase

05:52.569 --> 05:54.354
his face from my mind.

05:54.528 --> 05:55.355
Is that...

05:55.529 --> 05:58.401
Chloe Marlene?

05:58.532 --> 06:01.012
Just when you think this
day can't get any weirder,

06:01.099 --> 06:03.841
a big movie star shows up?

06:03.928 --> 06:05.452
Ignore her.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.018
Have you ever noticed
a delivery robot

06:07.192 --> 06:08.019
on this pier before?

06:08.106 --> 06:09.325
No, ma'am.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.371
Never had a famous
actress here either.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.635
Okay.

06:14.765 --> 06:15.897
McGee, can you
take over here?
Yeah.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.029
Hey, guys, guys,

06:18.116 --> 06:19.553
- eyes here.
- Yeah,

06:19.727 --> 06:20.902
doesn't the attention
ever get annoying?

06:20.989 --> 06:22.338
Oh, you get used to it.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.513
So, where are
we going now?

06:23.600 --> 06:24.906
To the only thing
on this pier

06:24.993 --> 06:26.211
that is not starstruck.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.604
Oh, I recognize this model.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.258
Oh, yeah?
Well, I can't
go shopping

06:29.432 --> 06:31.782
in public anymore, so I
order everything online

06:31.913 --> 06:33.915
and delivery bots come
to my house all the time.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.875
Okay, Agent Marlene,
tell me what you know.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.050
Me?
Mm-hmm.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.487
Okay.

06:40.574 --> 06:43.054
I'm pretty sure the
bots have cameras

06:43.228 --> 06:45.927
and are remotely operated
by the company's staff.

06:46.101 --> 06:47.624
Which means?

06:47.711 --> 06:50.235
The delivery company
must have a record

06:50.410 --> 06:54.718
of the sender and a video
of whoever loaded the head.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.067
Very good.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.373
Well, we've already reached out
to the company,

06:57.547 --> 06:58.809
so we're just waiting for them

06:58.983 --> 07:00.768
to get back to...

07:03.118 --> 07:04.554
What the hell?

07:06.948 --> 07:08.210
Bomb!

07:08.384 --> 07:09.646
Everybody run!

07:10.299 --> 07:11.648
Move, go, go!

07:18.263 --> 07:20.527
You have a delivery.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.638
Well, bomb squad is
obviously still fishing out

07:44.812 --> 07:46.030
pieces of the robot,

07:46.117 --> 07:47.510
but Knight says
it was a pipe bomb

07:47.684 --> 07:49.338
hidden underneath
the insulation.

07:49.512 --> 07:52.863
Because delivering a severed
head wasn't scary enough.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.475
Well, someone was driving
this thing. Who was it?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.041
Well, one very sick individual.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.216
We got a name?

07:58.303 --> 08:00.349
No, delivery company
says the robot

08:00.436 --> 08:01.481
wasn't under their control.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.095
Yeah. Do we know what
set the bomb off?

08:07.225 --> 08:08.705
Well, Knight is guessing

08:08.792 --> 08:10.315
that the countdown started
when she touched the robot.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.579
Then why didn't the
lieutenant trigger it first?

08:12.753 --> 08:14.885
Bomb tech thinks that there
was a loose wire somewhere.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.671
Knight somehow accidentally
reconnected it.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.152
Hell of a first day
for our movie star.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.850
I'm guessing it's her last.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.289
Hey, badass, you okay?

08:27.376 --> 08:29.770
Me? I've come to check on you.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.120
You seem oddly calm
for what just happened.

08:32.207 --> 08:35.427
My acting coach taught me a
technique called disassociation.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.691
Like disconnecting from reality?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.562
Yeah, I'm pretending
that the head and the bomb

08:39.693 --> 08:41.825
were just movie props
and I was never in danger.

08:41.912 --> 08:44.219
And that works?

08:44.306 --> 08:45.699
So far, so good.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.179
Even so, I think
you should consider going home.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.398
It's been a crazy day.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.183
I'm in the entertainment business.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.533
Every day's a crazy day.

08:53.707 --> 08:54.882
Look, I appreciate
the concern,

08:54.969 --> 08:56.579
but I'm gonna finish
what I started.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.887
I'm Cheyenne Fuentes.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.151
Hey, Jimmy!

09:03.325 --> 09:04.805
Hey, Nick.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.502
Dude, come on, don't leave me
alone with him.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.286
Oh, he's fascinating,
isn't he?

09:08.373 --> 09:09.766
Well, that's not
the word I'd use.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.420
Uh, yeah, I want
to show you something.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.117
Take a look at this cut line.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.989
I mean, 20 years
I have been down here.

09:15.163 --> 09:18.470
I have never seen
a slice this clean.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.515
Okay, what do you mean?

09:19.689 --> 09:21.386
Well, whatever blade separated

09:21.517 --> 09:23.388
this head from its body
was extremely sharp

09:23.519 --> 09:25.216
and moving
at a tremendous speed.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.480
- Like a sword?
- In a Chloe Marlene movie, maybe.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.960
Ugh.

09:30.134 --> 09:31.309
Well, I just hope that
he was already dead

09:31.440 --> 09:32.572
when he lost his head.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.182
I'm afraid not.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.749
Here, take a look
at the trachea here...

09:35.836 --> 09:37.098
All right, yeah, okay,
man, that's enough.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.316
All right, did
you notice he has

09:38.490 --> 09:39.666
two different color eyes?

09:39.753 --> 09:41.711
It's called heterochromia.

09:41.798 --> 09:42.799
English, please.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.062
It's a rare
but benign condition

09:45.236 --> 09:47.587
that causes a person's irises
to be two different colors.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.023
So, something he
was born with?

09:49.197 --> 09:51.286
Yeah, either that
or as a result of some sort

09:51.373 --> 09:52.330
of head injury--

09:52.504 --> 09:53.984
not counting this one.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.551
You have any ID on him yet?

09:55.638 --> 09:58.032
No, Kasie's examining some
of his hair as we speak.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.687
Our victim is Rosco Sanchez,

10:00.774 --> 10:01.992
a 62-year-old

10:02.123 --> 10:04.168
tech salesman from
Louisville, Kentucky.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.040
He was reported missing
by his boss last week.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.215
Put a trace on his cell.

10:07.389 --> 10:08.695
Maybe we can find
the rest of him.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.044
Already did, got
nothing, which means

10:10.218 --> 10:11.480
either his battery
died or...

10:11.654 --> 10:13.351
Or the killer turned off
his phone.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.353
Oh, this is great stuff.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.009
Yes, I haven't even gotten
to the good part yet.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.272
I may have another way
to find Sanchez.

10:21.446 --> 10:24.319
I did a deep dive into his
socials, and it turns out

10:24.406 --> 10:25.320
he has a pacemaker.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.713
And that helps us how?

10:26.887 --> 10:28.671
New pacemakers
are equipped with GPS.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.195
The manufacturer's emailing me
when we have a location.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.110
Wow, you're thorough.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.069
Yeah.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.637
More thorough than <i>Bayous
and Bridges,</i> that's for sure.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.290
My movie?

10:39.464 --> 10:42.293
Yes, now don't get me wrong,
I-I love your character,

10:42.467 --> 10:44.600
but I was offended when
the forensic analyst

10:44.731 --> 10:46.036
cut corners on the science

10:46.167 --> 10:47.821
and was still made out
to be the hero.

10:47.951 --> 10:49.823
What do you mean "cut corners"?

10:49.997 --> 10:52.303
Well, for one,
he ran that blood sample

10:52.477 --> 10:54.610
in an unsterile environment.

10:54.741 --> 10:55.611
- Kasie.
- And for two,

10:55.742 --> 10:56.917
if you really... Kasie.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.397
No, I'm sorry.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.225
I just wishfor once

11:01.312 --> 11:03.619
that movies reflected real life.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.404
Well, um, that's why I'm here.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.756
Yes, that is a good point.

11:12.628 --> 11:16.066
Um, oh, we have an address
on the pacemaker.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.416
Okay, I will give Torres a call.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.338
Let me get this straight.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.776
We're looking for a headless
body, while Knight

11:29.863 --> 11:31.865
is, uh, hanging out
with a movie star?

11:31.952 --> 11:33.214
Well, sounds
like somebody's jealous.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.563
No, I'm just saying
wouldn't you rather

11:34.737 --> 11:36.043
hang out with Chloe
than be here?

11:36.130 --> 11:37.827
Nope. This is
where the action is.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.742
Watch the cow crap.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.049
Well, seems like you and I have
two different definitions

11:42.136 --> 11:44.051
for the word "action."

11:44.225 --> 11:45.922
Ready?

11:46.096 --> 11:48.446
NCIS! Coming in!

11:54.583 --> 11:56.890
What the hell is this?

11:59.936 --> 12:02.460
Now we know how
our victim was decapitated.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.593
Our killer went
full medieval.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.161
You smell that?

12:07.248 --> 12:08.510
Yeah.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.425
Oh, God!

12:15.169 --> 12:17.519
That's got to be
the rest of Sanchez.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.913
Well, if that's him,

12:20.087 --> 12:21.871
who are they?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.919
What the hell?

12:26.049 --> 12:28.051
Two more headless victims?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.794
Which means we got to find
two more heads.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.279
Found them.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.063
Oh...

12:47.288 --> 12:49.856
Now we got
a serial killer to find.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.396
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:08.570 --> 13:10.528
Hi.

13:10.615 --> 13:13.009
Hi.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.534
Rough night?

13:16.621 --> 13:19.494
That's an understatement.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.626
My disassociation technique?

13:22.584 --> 13:25.413
It stopped working
after the sun went down.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.459
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I've been there.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.419
How'd you learn to leave
your work at the office?

13:31.506 --> 13:33.725
I will let you know
when I do.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.641
Well, on the plus side,
you're helping me

13:36.816 --> 13:38.382
find Cheyenne Fuentes.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.297
And let me tell you,

13:40.471 --> 13:43.474
she's a badass who doesn't
take crap from anyone.

13:43.605 --> 13:45.085
I like her already.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.740
Okay.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.005
All right.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.137
Day two. Let's do this.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.140
Good morning.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.664
Welcome back, Chloe.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.753
Thanks, Nick.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.582
So... what'd I miss?

14:09.892 --> 14:13.113
What? Did you find
Sanchez's body?

14:13.287 --> 14:14.679
We did.

14:14.766 --> 14:15.985
Plus a couple more.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.118
Uh, more-more what,
headless bodies?

14:18.292 --> 14:20.642
Yep, but, uh, if it makes
you feel any better,

14:20.772 --> 14:23.123
we also found their heads.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.864
Oh, my God.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.778
Oh, my...

14:26.909 --> 14:29.216
What kind of person would do
something like this?

14:29.346 --> 14:30.130
The careful kind.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.001
All three bodies
were wiped clean.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.785
No prints on the guillotine, either.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.787
I'm sorry,
did you say "guillotine"?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.573
- Yeah.
- Local LEOs just told me

14:38.703 --> 14:40.140
the barn's owner died years ago.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.706
As far as they knew,
the place was empty.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.144
Well, who-who are these people?

14:44.318 --> 14:47.887
We've got Mikeala Greer
from Delaware.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.453
Braxton Bell
from North Carolina.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.239
And you remember
our first victim, Rosco Sanchez.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.111
All abducted in the past week.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.939
And all had
two different color eyes.

14:57.113 --> 14:58.593
It's called heterochromia.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.421
I guess our killer's
not a fan.

15:00.551 --> 15:03.163
But why would anyone kill
someone based on eye color?

15:03.250 --> 15:06.731
- That's a really good question.
- And-and why send a head
to Lieutenant Harlan,

15:06.818 --> 15:08.385
who has two-two blue eyes?

15:08.559 --> 15:10.170
Yeah, well,
that's another good question.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.823
How about answers?
Anybody got one of those?

15:11.954 --> 15:13.477
McGEE:
Yeah, I might have one.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.350
Found this on the lieutenant's
social media page.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.048
Take a look
at her husband, John.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.705
Two different colored eyes.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.186
You think the bomb was
actually meant for him?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.710
Let's not wait around
and find out. Go, take McGee.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.932
Vance wants to see me.

15:34.063 --> 15:35.760
Okay.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.071
It's time to go home.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.074
You know I'm right.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.163
And don't be down on yourself.
You did great.

15:47.294 --> 15:49.557
I mean, you impressed me
in more ways than one.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.125
Honestly, it really means
a lot coming from you.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.432
And, I mean, I learned a ton.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.740
And I think you're gonna make
a great fake federal agent.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.655
Thanks.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.223
Hey, just promise me one thing?

16:04.180 --> 16:06.226
Catch the monster who did this.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.923
Will do.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.493
Director,
you got something for me?

16:12.623 --> 16:15.017
I asked Dr. Mallard to do a
psych eval on our serial killer.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.672
Which Dr. Palmer has agreed
to present.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.195
Okay, Jimmy, what do ya got?

16:19.326 --> 16:20.805
Well, what I have is
a history lesson.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.459
Uh, in 18th century France,

16:22.590 --> 16:24.026
people with two
different colored eyes

16:24.157 --> 16:25.593
were seen as possessed.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.029
They were teased,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.553
they were ostracized, sometimes...

16:29.684 --> 16:30.902
they were even killed.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.600
That's a common theme
throughout time.

16:32.687 --> 16:35.211
Yeah, to treat people
who looked or acted differently

16:35.342 --> 16:36.734
as evil spirits.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.606
Like the witches of Salem.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.348
We all know
- how they were punished.
- They were hanged.

16:41.478 --> 16:44.699
Any guesses as to how
they treated heterochromatics?

16:44.873 --> 16:46.657
Chopped off their heads?

16:46.788 --> 16:48.181
The belief was

16:48.268 --> 16:50.139
that in order
to vanquish the demon

16:50.313 --> 16:52.272
they needed to separate
the head from its soul.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.709
So history is
repeating itself.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.928
- Why?
- We can only guess.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.018
Perhaps the killer suffered
some sort

16:59.148 --> 17:00.584
of trauma at the hands
of a heterochromatic person,

17:00.715 --> 17:02.238
and now is seeking revenge

17:02.369 --> 17:04.458
on anyone
with two different colored eyes.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.895
That doesn't explain why
Lieutenant Harlan was targeted.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.505
Or the bomb.
We just learned

17:08.636 --> 17:10.855
that her husband has
different colored eyes.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.642
Our theory is that the killer
got the wrong Harlan.

17:14.816 --> 17:15.860
I don't think so.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.514
Our killer has been
careful so far.

17:17.688 --> 17:18.994
So you're thinking
that there's another reason

17:19.081 --> 17:20.300
she would've been targeted?

17:20.430 --> 17:21.866
Maybe.

17:21.997 --> 17:23.955
If you look closely,

17:24.130 --> 17:25.957
there's one person
waiting to be executed

17:26.088 --> 17:28.090
who is not heterochromatic.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.178
Two brown eyes.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.050
Notice anything else about her?

17:33.617 --> 17:34.966
She's pregnant.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.317
Historically,
women who were impregnated

17:37.404 --> 17:39.449
by heterochromatic men
were also targeted,

17:39.536 --> 17:41.234
because the trait is hereditary.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.758
So if Lieutenant happens
to be pregnant,

17:43.932 --> 17:45.020
her child would
likely have it, too.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.978
And since you can't chop off

17:47.153 --> 17:48.502
the head of an unborn child...

17:48.632 --> 17:50.243
You blow up the mom instead.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.681
We need to get the Harlans
into protective custody.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.553
McGee and Torres are
on the way to their house now.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.120
Hey, McGee, what do you got?

17:58.207 --> 17:59.730
McGEE [over comm]: I got
a guesthouse in the back.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.515
One window broken.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.343
And a broken security camera.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.475
All right, I'll clear
the guesthouse.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.651
I'll clear the main house.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.789
NCIS!

18:16.617 --> 18:18.836
Anyone home?

18:20.316 --> 18:21.796
McGEE:
All right, guesthouse is empty.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.060
Hey, McGee, there was
a fight in here.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.891
And it looks like
the Harlans lost.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.155
You think they
could've been taken?

18:33.286 --> 18:35.331
I do.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.907
Jimmy was right.
The lieutenant is pregnant.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.955
Yes, 32 inches wide,
27 inches on the longest side.

18:51.086 --> 18:54.002
- That's correct.
- Unreal.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.092
Great. Okay, thank you
for the information.

18:58.398 --> 19:01.140
What kind of psycho builds
their own guillotine?

19:01.270 --> 19:04.447
Uh, well, I actually found
a how-to guide online.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.797
Laid out the whole process
step by step.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.973
Oh, thank you, Internet.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.019
They're actually pretty easy
to build. You can get

19:11.150 --> 19:13.543
all the materials
at the hardware store.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.979
Except the blade.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.633
That's a specialty item.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.897
So where do
D.I.Y. serial killers

19:19.984 --> 19:22.073
get their guillotine blades?

19:22.248 --> 19:23.988
My question exactly.
It turns out

19:24.075 --> 19:26.295
there's only
one industrial manufacturer

19:26.469 --> 19:27.818
in the tri-state area
that makes them.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.211
They sold a blade

19:29.342 --> 19:31.387
with these exact dimensions
last month.

19:31.518 --> 19:32.997
Did they give you
the name of the buyer?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.434
No. He paid cash.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.175
Do they remember what he looks
like? Maybe we could

19:36.305 --> 19:38.046
- get a sketch.
- There's no need.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.179
He just ordered a new blade.

19:40.309 --> 19:41.441
Because we took his guillotine,

19:41.615 --> 19:44.095
and now the psycho
needs to build a new one.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.446
- We need to stop him.
- Well, you better hurry.

19:46.576 --> 19:49.013
'Cause he's picking up
the blade this morning.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.234
Not if we pick him up first.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.241
All right,
we're all set.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.982
Store manager talked
to our guy.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.071
He's five minutes out,
driving a blue van.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.552
Why are these sick dudes
always driving a van?

20:05.682 --> 20:08.337
Well, I'm more concerned
with what's inside that van.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.426
You don't think he was
dumb enough to bring

20:10.557 --> 20:12.036
the Harlans on an
errand run, right?

20:12.123 --> 20:13.386
This guy believes
that people

20:13.473 --> 20:15.475
with two different
colored eyes have demons

20:15.649 --> 20:18.565
living inside them.
"Dumb enough" isn't a question.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.958
Good point.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.310
Hey, you know
Chloe has a movie

20:24.440 --> 20:26.268
where she's doing a
stakeout just like this.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.836
Except her partner is
- a German Shepherd.
- Yeah.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.272
I saw <i>Paw and Order.</i>

20:30.403 --> 20:32.448
90 minutes of my life
I'll never get back.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.407
But you have to admit,
Chloe was pretty amazing

20:34.494 --> 20:36.931
saving that dog
from the bulldozer.

20:37.105 --> 20:39.412
Seems like somebody's missing
their girlfriend.

20:40.543 --> 20:42.893
Uh, it was probably good
that she left when she left.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.068
There were sparks
between us.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.070
Oh, yeah?
Did she know that?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.290
I think she was
figuring it out.

20:48.377 --> 20:51.075
It's too bad she left before
I could show her my video.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.512
What video?

20:52.642 --> 20:54.949
Oh, you don't think my mom
historically recorded

20:55.123 --> 20:56.690
my portrayal
of The Mad Hatter?

20:56.820 --> 20:59.519
- Oh, I got to see that.
- Oh, we'll have
a special viewing.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.439
Here we go.

21:08.876 --> 21:11.487
Blacked-out windows.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.100
You seeing
what I'm seeing?

21:18.320 --> 21:19.843
That's the tourist
from the pier.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.324
He wasn't there
to sightsee.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.416
NCIS!

21:28.765 --> 21:30.637
On the ground.
On the ground now!

21:30.767 --> 21:33.509
Okay, okay.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.513
Go ahead, I got him.

21:40.211 --> 21:43.911
I'm afraid you're gonna
be disappointed.

21:43.998 --> 21:46.783
They're not back there.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.443
Told you.

21:55.444 --> 21:56.924
Where are they?

22:10.851 --> 22:12.418
Who is he?

22:12.592 --> 22:15.029
Sam Novak, 35, unemployed,

22:15.159 --> 22:16.857
former college
professor of--

22:17.031 --> 22:18.293
wait for it--

22:18.424 --> 22:19.642
French History.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.297
Explains his fascination
with guillotines.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.081
Why'd he stop teaching?

22:24.212 --> 22:26.301
Totaled his car a few years
ago, busted his head open.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.651
After that, he informed the
university that he was

22:28.738 --> 22:30.523
- no longer fit to teach.
- Well, no argument here.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.612
We don't have access
to his medical records,

22:32.742 --> 22:34.744
but it's not a stretch
to imagine that he suffered

22:34.875 --> 22:36.659
a traumatic brain injury
in the accident.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.009
Can we tie him
to the beheadings?

22:39.096 --> 22:40.881
He was on the pier at
the same time as the explosion,

22:41.011 --> 22:43.884
and we just caught him buying
a blade for a guillotine.

22:44.014 --> 22:45.451
This is our guy.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.670
And what did our guy
do with the Harlans?

22:47.801 --> 22:49.629
He won't say.
We looked in his apartment

22:49.759 --> 22:51.892
and the barn where we found
the bodies-- nothing.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.676
Property tax records shows
that he owns

22:53.807 --> 22:55.548
a cabin about an hour
west of here.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.288
Torres is on
his way there now.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.333
And if the Harlans aren't there?

22:58.464 --> 23:00.117
Well, we somehow have
to get him

23:00.291 --> 23:01.684
to tell us
where they are.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.123
Well, welcome.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.387
Please come in, have a seat.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.695
Mr. Novak,
you know why you're here?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.263
Because...

23:15.394 --> 23:17.700
murder is against the law.

23:17.787 --> 23:20.050
So you're admitting
to beheading people?

23:20.181 --> 23:21.704
Yes.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.925
Ah.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.841
Oh, come on, don't give me
those judgmental looks.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.409
- You should be thanking me.
- For what?

23:30.496 --> 23:33.412
E-Eradicating evil
from our planet.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.285
Well, having
a genetic eye condition

23:37.459 --> 23:39.026
does not make someone evil.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.029
So you're not only judgmental,
you're ignorant.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.422
It's a bad combination.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.380
So is kidnapping
and murdering.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.034
You're facing the death penalty.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.296
An eye for an eye.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.385
How perfectly barbaric.

23:50.559 --> 23:53.127
We might be able
to take the death penalty

23:53.257 --> 23:56.173
off the table
if the Harlans are still alive.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.174
Oh, they're alive.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.959
For now.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.090
Where are they?

24:00.221 --> 24:02.397
That's...

24:02.528 --> 24:05.269
not something
I'm ready to disclose.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.358
To either of you.

24:07.489 --> 24:10.449
I'd like to talk to the agent
I saw at the pier yesterday.

24:13.234 --> 24:17.281
Special Agent Chloe Marlene.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.417
Well, she's not an agent.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.158
But I think
you know that already.

24:24.288 --> 24:27.117
Then why did you bring her
to my crime scene?

24:27.204 --> 24:28.858
All right.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.207
Enough with the games.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.296
Where are the Harlans?

24:32.427 --> 24:34.603
Are you not hearing me?

24:34.734 --> 24:36.649
If you want
to save that happy couple,

24:36.779 --> 24:38.564
bring Chloe in
to interrogate me.

24:38.651 --> 24:39.956
Let her, let her finish
what she started.

24:40.087 --> 24:42.350
- That's not happening.
- Then we're done here.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.657
Novak, listen... No.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.572
You listen.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.792
You bring Chloe here,

24:49.966 --> 24:52.012
I will tell her exactly
where the couple is.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.667
If you don't, they die.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.458
What the hell was that?

25:03.589 --> 25:04.503
That was crazy being crazy.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.243
He's definitely
playing games.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.680
He thinks he has
all the leverage.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.029
He doesn't know that we know
about his cabin.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.465
Any word
yet from Torres?

25:10.639 --> 25:12.598
He just texted.
Almost there.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.252
Hey, Parker.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.819
Tell me you found the Harlans.

25:16.993 --> 25:19.169
No, but I found
what Novak wanted us to find.

25:19.256 --> 25:22.129
A photo of the Harlans chained
to a wall somewhere.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.044
Damn it!

25:24.218 --> 25:25.698
He must've known we were coming.

25:25.872 --> 25:28.004
Yeah, and it gets worse.
He left us a stopwatch.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.224
It reads two hours and
42 minutes, and it's ticking.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.444
Knight said that she found
a stopwatch attached to the bomb

25:33.575 --> 25:35.446
- in the robot.
- Yeah, and it looks like

25:35.577 --> 25:36.970
there's a pipe bomb
next to the Harlans.

25:37.057 --> 25:38.275
All right, send me
that photo right away.

25:38.406 --> 25:39.712
I will. But there's no clue

25:39.842 --> 25:41.844
to their location
in this picture.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.977
There may be another
way to find them, but, uh,

25:44.064 --> 25:46.153
I got to get Vance
to sign off on it first.

25:46.283 --> 25:50.287
You're asking me to allow
a movie star to interrogate

25:50.418 --> 25:52.507
- a serial killer?
- Yes.

25:52.681 --> 25:53.639
And you think
that's a good idea?

25:53.813 --> 25:56.642
No. But it's the best
bad idea we have.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.774
Go take another run at Novak.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.863
I already tried.
He won't talk to us.

26:01.037 --> 26:03.387
He says it's Chloe Marlene
or no one.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.302
Why? What, what is
he getting out of this?

26:05.476 --> 26:06.521
I only care
what we get out of it.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.088
We need to find
these people.

26:08.262 --> 26:09.655
The clock is ticking.

26:09.742 --> 26:11.308
So this guy's weapon of choice

26:11.482 --> 26:13.528
is a guillotine or a bomb.

26:13.659 --> 26:14.790
Guess he's
a versatile serial killer.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.750
The vast majority
of close-contact bombs

26:17.924 --> 26:19.839
decapitate the victim.
Now, this guy's

26:19.969 --> 26:21.449
already detonated
one this week, Director.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.756
And we have less
than three hours

26:23.886 --> 26:25.671
to stop him
from detonating another one.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.806
Go get her.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.727
<i>And action!</i>

26:38.858 --> 26:41.208
Know why the Navy
intercepted your vessel?

26:41.338 --> 26:43.166
No, ma'am, we were just out
on a fishing trip.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.777
Oh, really?

26:44.907 --> 26:46.256
You have a fishing
boat filled

26:46.430 --> 26:49.564
with stolen M67 grenades?

26:49.695 --> 26:52.654
- Cut!
- Cutting.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.177
Who the hell are you?

26:54.264 --> 26:56.049
NCIS agents.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.920
Real ones.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.226
Jessica?

27:00.793 --> 27:02.446
I mean, when I said
you guys could visit the set,

27:02.577 --> 27:03.839
I-I didn't mean like this.

27:03.926 --> 27:07.147
Yeah, sorry, Chloe,
we just need you now.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.801
For what?

27:08.975 --> 27:11.804
Time to play
a federal agent in real life.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.726
He can't see
in here?

27:20.856 --> 27:21.901
No.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.077
Then why is he
staring right at me?

27:24.164 --> 27:26.079
That's his resting psycho face.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.604
Why do I have to go
in there alone?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.695
It's the only way
that he's gonna talk.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.828
So you go in there,
you let him talk.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.960
Find out where the Harlans are,
and then you get out.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.745
You won't be
in danger.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.790
He's in handcuffs
and leg shackles.

27:41.921 --> 27:44.532
And just in case,
we'll be right here.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.535
- It's normal to feel scared.
- Mm-hmm.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.320
Good.
Because I'm terrified.

27:50.451 --> 27:53.149
I mean, not of him.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.629
I mean, I'm scared
of failing.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.326
If I fail on set,
I get another take.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.763
But if I fail in there,
two people die.

27:57.893 --> 27:59.329
No, listen to me.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.288
You are not going to fail.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.944
You have my lines?

28:05.074 --> 28:06.815
Okay.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.862
You remember
your disassociation technique.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.429
Imagine that
he's just a character

28:12.603 --> 28:14.301
- in another one of your scenes.
- Okay.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.129
And remember, he's
gonna try to mess with you.

28:16.303 --> 28:17.739
Don't take the bait.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.960
Okay, let me get that.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.136
- You ready?
- No.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.703
But I'm going in there.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.150
How's it going?

28:37.237 --> 28:38.891
Sam, right?

28:39.021 --> 28:41.589
Hello, Chloe.
Thank you for coming.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.812
Uh, you're, you're
so much prettier in person.

28:46.942 --> 28:48.291
Thanks.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.511
Mind if I sit?

29:02.479 --> 29:04.525
Don't be nervous. I won't bite.

29:04.612 --> 29:07.049
Sorry.

29:07.136 --> 29:10.183
It's just a little weird,
you staring like that.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.622
Um...

29:14.709 --> 29:17.625
Well, look, here I am.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.888
Like you asked.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.847
So will you please just tell me
where the Harlans are?

29:21.977 --> 29:23.805
Oh, we'll get to that.

29:23.936 --> 29:27.287
First I wanted to educate you
about the "evil eye."

29:27.461 --> 29:28.984
Uh, no, we...

29:29.071 --> 29:30.812
um, really don't have time.

29:30.943 --> 29:32.814
Who doesn't have time?

29:32.945 --> 29:35.991
We've got all the time
in the world.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.257
Um...
Oh.

29:41.388 --> 29:42.737
You mean the Harlans.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.653
Yeah, they're running
out of time.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.874
Uh, yeah, we know.

29:49.048 --> 29:50.658
NCIS found your little, uh,

29:50.745 --> 29:52.268
message in your cabin.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.140
I had a feeling they would.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.013
Why go through all the trouble?

29:58.100 --> 30:00.320
I had no choice.

30:00.494 --> 30:04.106
Your friends behind the glass
confiscated my guillotine.

30:04.237 --> 30:07.109
I had to build one. I knew
that picking up the second

30:07.240 --> 30:09.242
blade would be risky.

30:09.329 --> 30:12.898
So in the case
that I got caught,

30:12.985 --> 30:16.510
my bomb was
my backup plan, you see?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.034
I'm always thinking ahead.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.732
Killing people isn't
something to be proud of.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.473
Killing the right people is.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.695
You're sick, man.

30:28.914 --> 30:32.047
So just tell me where the
Harlans are or I'm leaving.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.878
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.710
We both know
you're not going anywhere.

30:44.277 --> 30:47.280
Honestly, I thought you were
a better actor than that.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.156
Okay, this is exactly
what I was afraid of.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.854
Just give her a minute.
She's nervous.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.725
That makes two of us.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.251
Well, maybe you and I
can help each other.

31:05.037 --> 31:08.736
I have more than three million
followers on social media.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.956
You tell me where
the Harlans are,

31:11.043 --> 31:13.872
I'll post anything you
want about the "evil eye."

31:15.961 --> 31:17.963
That's a lot of followers.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.227
Bet Nancy would be proud,
wherever she is.

31:23.403 --> 31:25.318
Who's Nancy?

31:26.536 --> 31:27.886
That's her mother.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.628
Good luck finding her.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.718
Oh, you mean
because she's unlisted?

31:35.894 --> 31:36.938
That's probably smart,

31:37.069 --> 31:40.507
being the mother of a huge star.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.424
But, uh...

31:44.598 --> 31:49.081
I have a knack
for finding people.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.431
Where are the Harlans?

31:51.561 --> 31:53.172
You see, the secret

31:53.302 --> 31:55.174
is patience.

31:55.304 --> 31:56.958
I would go to Toledo,

31:57.089 --> 31:59.004
where your mother lives,

31:59.178 --> 32:01.006
and I would
just wait.

32:01.136 --> 32:04.574
For as long as it takes.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.011
Well, too bad you're
gonna rot in here

32:06.141 --> 32:07.186
for the rest of your life.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.666
Is that what NCIS told you?

32:11.755 --> 32:13.148
They lied to you.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.802
I'm getting out.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.238
And when I do,

32:16.369 --> 32:18.240
the first trip I'm going to make

32:18.371 --> 32:20.242
is to Nancy.

32:22.766 --> 32:23.898
What's going on?

32:27.380 --> 32:29.948
Cheyenne Fuentes doesn't cry.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.046
I'm sorry.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.830
I can't. I can't.
- I can't.
- It's okay.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.266
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.051
It's okay.

32:46.225 --> 32:47.356
No, it's not okay.
It's not okay.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.228
I just got
two people killed.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.056
Oh, my God.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.723
All right,
we got less than an hour

33:06.854 --> 33:08.421
till this bomb blows. Ideas?

33:08.508 --> 33:10.510
I've got a warrant
for Novak's cell phone

33:10.684 --> 33:11.902
to retrace his movements.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.252
But it's been powered off
for a week.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.080
I talked to the
Harlans' neighbor.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.385
He remembered seeing the
blue van in the driveway

33:16.516 --> 33:18.735
but doesn't recall
in which direction it drove off.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.738
I scanned downtown traffic cams
from this morning. No blue van.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.305
Which brings us back to Novak.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.220
He is the only way
we're gonna find the Harlans.

33:25.307 --> 33:28.049
But how? He was never
gonna tell Chloe anything.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.964
I mean, he was
only messing with her head

33:30.138 --> 33:31.313
so he could wait
for the bomb to blow.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.881
Because all Novak does
is play mind games.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.926
So let's play a mind
game against him.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.319
How? He won't even talk to us.

33:37.450 --> 33:40.322
Well, what does Ducky's
psych eval say about him?

33:40.496 --> 33:42.890
That he's
a narcissistic control freak

33:42.977 --> 33:46.241
who has a constant need to show
everyone how smart he is.

33:46.372 --> 33:47.764
Exactly.

33:47.938 --> 33:48.765
So let's show him
how smart he is.

33:48.896 --> 33:49.636
By doing what?

33:49.766 --> 33:51.116
By letting him win.

33:53.205 --> 33:56.077
Nick, if we let him win,
that means the Harlans die.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.688
Well, not necessarily.

33:58.775 --> 33:59.646
You know where Chloe is?

33:59.776 --> 34:01.039
Yeah.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.869
Hey.

34:08.176 --> 34:11.136
Look, uh, if you don't
mind, I'd rather be alone.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.531
Chloe, I know this sucks,

34:15.662 --> 34:18.317
but we don't have time to feel
sorry for ourselves right now.

34:18.447 --> 34:19.709
What, is this your version
of a pep talk?

34:19.883 --> 34:21.668
No. It's
a strategy session.

34:21.798 --> 34:24.584
You're gonna get Novak to
tell us where the Harlans are.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.194
We just did
this, Jess.

34:26.325 --> 34:28.370
I tried everything
you said to do.

34:28.544 --> 34:30.068
It didn't work.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.940
Doesn't mean we give up.

34:33.027 --> 34:35.334
As long as there is time left
on that stopwatch,

34:35.464 --> 34:37.466
we have to do everything
we can to save them.

34:37.597 --> 34:40.165
I know. But at this point,
I am only in the way.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.819
Honestly, you are
better off without me.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.517
You know he will
only talk to you.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.823
You are the only shot
that we have at this.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.521
What else can I do?

34:48.608 --> 34:49.826
I'll tell you along the way.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.046
Along the way where?

34:53.613 --> 34:54.962
No.

34:55.658 --> 34:56.964
No.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.748
I-I can't go back in that room.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.707
Yes, you can.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.187
Because you know
what's at stake.

35:02.361 --> 35:04.624
You wanted a taste
at being an agent.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.756
We are gonna give you
everything that you can chew.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.542
This is what an agent does.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.544
We hit a wall, we go over it.

35:11.631 --> 35:12.588
Or around it.

35:12.719 --> 35:13.807
Or if need be,

35:13.937 --> 35:15.635
we bust
the damn thing down.

35:15.809 --> 35:18.203
Are you ready to be
our sledgehammer?

35:36.743 --> 35:38.005
Oh, Chloe.

35:38.092 --> 35:39.180
What a pleasant surprise.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.790
I thought I'd seen
the last of you.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.966
You and me both.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.578
I really hate this guy.

35:45.665 --> 35:48.233
Yeah. He is very hateable.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.629
Mm, I smell a game plan.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.414
What have you all
been cooking up?

35:55.544 --> 35:57.807
There's no game plan.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.374
They just sent you in to say hi?

35:59.548 --> 36:01.333
Hi.

36:01.463 --> 36:02.812
No.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.773
I came in here
to say that, uh...

36:08.470 --> 36:09.689
...you won.

36:15.434 --> 36:18.219
Wow. Time flies
when you're having fun.

36:18.350 --> 36:19.481
It's over.

36:19.612 --> 36:20.961
You win.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.746
No. No.

36:23.833 --> 36:27.097
S-Society wins.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.274
All I've been doing
is sacrificing myself

36:29.448 --> 36:31.493
- for the greater good.
- You don't really think

36:31.624 --> 36:34.496
that people with different
colored eyes are evil.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.237
I don't think it. I know it.

36:36.368 --> 36:39.632
Well, I hate to break
it to you, but...

36:39.719 --> 36:41.938
that's just some
conspiracy theory.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.853
And it's not
even a good one.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.681
And here you are,

36:45.812 --> 36:47.553
killing innocent people.

36:49.163 --> 36:51.861
I know for a fact
they're not innocent.

36:51.948 --> 36:52.819
They're evil.

36:52.949 --> 36:55.082
What makes you so sure?

36:55.213 --> 36:57.606
Because...

36:57.737 --> 36:59.217
I'm evil.

37:06.746 --> 37:08.661
I was not expecting that.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.271
Neither was Chloe.

37:12.534 --> 37:13.753
She's spooked.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.058
I don't know if she can do this.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.669
She has to.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.464
Time's up.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.336
Kaboom.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.906
Agent Knight.

37:36.993 --> 37:38.473
Did you come in to celebrate?

37:39.474 --> 37:41.955
You sick son of a bitch.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.349
These people did
not deserve that!

37:44.479 --> 37:46.351
I respectfully disagree.

37:47.352 --> 37:51.138
Wipe that smile off of your
face or I will do it for you.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.359
Chloe, wipe your tears.

37:54.489 --> 37:55.925
This is a good thing.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.187
You heartless prick.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.798
These people have families.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.149
Ah.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.978
I see what this visit
was all about.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.849
You want to know
where to find the bodies?

38:06.936 --> 38:08.329
What's left of them.

38:23.605 --> 38:26.739
7517 Palm Avenue in Alexandria.

38:28.567 --> 38:29.829
See?

38:29.959 --> 38:32.962
I-I'm not as heartless
as you think.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.707
And you're not as
smart as you think.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.711
We reset the stopwatch

38:42.842 --> 38:44.583
50 minutes ahead.

38:44.713 --> 38:47.325
I didn't think you were gonna be
stupid enough to fall for it,

38:47.412 --> 38:49.065
but you proved me wrong.

38:51.198 --> 38:54.419
And you said I was a bad actor.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.162
NCIS!

38:59.293 --> 39:01.121
- You both okay?
- Please hurry!
There's a bomb!

39:02.165 --> 39:03.819
23 seconds.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.865
All right, don't worry.
We're gonna get you out of here.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.519
18 seconds.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.434
Spread your hands apart as
far as you possibly can.

39:10.391 --> 39:11.218
Stay completely still.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.872
- Okay. Close your eyes.
- Don't miss!

39:13.786 --> 39:15.657
- Ten seconds! Let's go! Move!
- Go, go, go.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.398
All right, go. Come on,
come on. Go, go, go, go, go!

39:17.529 --> 39:18.878
Move!

39:27.016 --> 39:28.801
Nice hack, lumberjack.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.456
And you were afraid
you were gonna miss.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.240
You were?

39:37.810 --> 39:39.028
Thank you. Great work.

39:39.115 --> 39:40.421
See you tomorrow.

39:40.552 --> 39:41.901
So, good news--

39:42.075 --> 39:43.119
Lieutenant Harlan

39:43.293 --> 39:44.469
and her husband are okay.

39:44.643 --> 39:46.079
Oh, thank God.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.690
Hey, so who ended up,
uh, swinging the axe?

39:49.691 --> 39:50.692
McGee.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.912
Oh, come on.

39:53.042 --> 39:54.130
You love it.

39:54.261 --> 39:55.784
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.134
Most importantly, everyone
made it out in one piece.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.398
You guys pulled it off.

40:00.485 --> 40:01.921
<i>We</i> pulled it off.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.358
Jess told me that the stopwatch
thing was your idea.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.492
Oh, no. [stammers] You know,
more of a team effort. Uh...

40:07.622 --> 40:08.928
I just played
a huge part.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.672
So, what does the team
usually do to celebrate?

40:13.802 --> 40:15.282
Uh...

40:15.456 --> 40:16.675
we go home.

40:16.805 --> 40:18.241
Yeah, and kind of do
it again tomorrow.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.156
No rest
for the weary.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.942
I feel you. I got a 6:00 a.m.
call time tomorrow morning.

40:23.116 --> 40:24.944
But I know exactly

40:25.074 --> 40:27.120
how to play Cheyenne Fuentes,

40:27.250 --> 40:28.861
thanks
to my excellent scene partner.

40:29.949 --> 40:31.167
Thank you.

40:31.298 --> 40:32.604
Glad I could help.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.041
And speaking
of scene partners, Nick,

40:35.171 --> 40:36.477
how would you feel
about dusting off

40:36.608 --> 40:38.697
those middle school
acting chops?

40:38.827 --> 40:40.873
Oh, I don't...

40:40.960 --> 40:41.961
Seriously?

40:42.091 --> 40:43.310
Yeah, some guy
had to drop out.

40:43.397 --> 40:45.617
I think the role
would be perfect for you.

40:45.747 --> 40:48.402
I don't know. I feel like my
skills are a little rusty,

40:48.533 --> 40:50.404
and I feel like this is
all kind of last-minute.

40:50.535 --> 40:51.536
Okay. No pressure.

40:51.666 --> 40:52.667
I'll do it.

40:53.712 --> 40:54.756
Great.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.105
<i>And action.</i>

40:56.236 --> 40:58.368
Scuse me.

40:58.499 --> 41:01.633
Where's
the master-at-arms?

41:01.807 --> 41:03.286
Oh, you wanted to see me,
Petty Officer?

41:03.417 --> 41:04.505
Yes, Agent Fuentes.

41:04.636 --> 41:06.376
We made an awful discovery

41:06.507 --> 41:07.856
when we opened
one of the crates.

41:07.987 --> 41:09.118
What did you find?

41:09.249 --> 41:10.772
A body.

41:17.649 --> 41:20.565
And that's why you
shouldn't smuggle guns.

41:20.695 --> 41:22.001
And cut!

41:22.175 --> 41:23.437
Wonderful!

41:23.568 --> 41:25.570
Moving on.

41:27.006 --> 41:29.399
Nice work,
- Daniel Day-Torres.
- Yeah.

41:29.530 --> 41:31.358
Did you see my eyeballs moving?

41:31.489 --> 41:32.664
- No, no. Not at all.
- No?

41:32.794 --> 41:34.013
No, you did great.

41:34.143 --> 41:35.667
Hey, are you sure
you only need one take?

41:35.841 --> 41:38.017
Because, uh, I-I think I want
to try something different.

41:38.191 --> 41:39.845
No, we're good.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.890
Well, I mean, you're-you're
dead. There's only one way.

41:42.021 --> 41:43.805
But, no, like,
seriously, don't worry.
