WEBVTT

01:42.720 --> 01:43.915
Excuse me.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.635
I was looking for
the <i>Weekly Volcano</i> office.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.359
I wish to see Mr. Dashwood.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.950
A friend of mine desired me
to offer a story by her.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.077
She... She wrote it.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.949
- She'd be glad to write more if this suits.
- Not a first attempt, I take it.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.760
No, sir. She has sold to <i>Olympic</i>
and <i>Scandal,</i>

02:03.840 --> 02:07.038
and got a prize for a tale
at the <i>Blarneystone Banner.</i>

02:07.120 --> 02:08.520
A prize?

02:10.080 --> 02:11.080
Yes.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.160
Sit.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.520
We'll take this.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.556
Oh, you will?

03:00.640 --> 03:02.677
With alterations. It's too long.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.116
Uh... but you've cut...

03:07.760 --> 03:10.275
I took care to have
a few of my sinners repent.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.272
The countryjust went through a war.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.717
People want to be amused,
not preached at.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.797
Morals don't sell nowadays.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.236
Perhaps mention that
to your friend.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.314
What compensation...?
How do you...?

03:26.400 --> 03:28.915
We pay 25 to 30 for things
of this sort.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.559
We'll pay 20 for that.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.312
You can have it. Make the edits.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.957
Should I tell my friend that you'll take
another if she had one better than this?

03:49.080 --> 03:51.800
We'll look at it.
Tell her to make it short and spicy.

03:51.880 --> 03:56.432
And if the main character's a girl,
make sure she's married by the end.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.591
- Or dead. Either way.
- Excuse me?

03:59.160 --> 04:02.278
What name would she like put to the story?

04:02.480 --> 04:06.235
Oh, uh... Yes, none at all, if you please.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.073
Just as she likes, of course.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.833
Oh, well... ha, ha.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.909
Good morning, sir. Good day.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.309
Yes!

04:52.680 --> 04:55.240
My Beth would like you very much.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.996
- I'd like a room for two people.
- Perfect. That's 4.50 a week.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.437
- And that's a good price.
- Isn't that a little expensive?

05:02.520 --> 05:04.830
This is a boardinghouse, not a charity.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.673
I need the rent on time.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.872
Good afternoon, Miss March.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.320
Oh, good afternoon.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.554
You're on fire.

05:25.640 --> 05:26.640
Thank you.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.280
You're on fire!

05:31.360 --> 05:33.238
Oh! Oh!

05:34.920 --> 05:37.674
- Thank you.
- I have the same habit. You see?

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
Oh.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.958
Kitty and Minnie are waiting.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.238
- Oh... My students need me.
- Always working.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.870
Money is the end and aim of
my mercenary existence.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.954
No one gets ink stains like yours
just out of a desire for money.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.835
My sister Amy's in Paris,
and until she marries someone wealthy,

05:57.960 --> 06:00.077
it's up to me to keep the family afloat.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.230
Goodbye.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.032
The Decadents have ruined Paris,
if you ask me.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.796
These French women couldn't lift
a hairbrush.

06:29.880 --> 06:30.996
- Amy!
- Mm.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.391
I said, these French women
couldn't lift a hairbrush.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.040
- Oh, yes. Very true, Aunt March.
- Oh...

06:37.120 --> 06:38.998
Don't humor me, girl.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.598
What do they write,
your troublemaking family?

06:43.680 --> 06:46.036
Mother doesn't say anything
about Beth.

06:47.040 --> 06:51.512
- I feel I should go back, but they all say, "Stay."
- You can do nothing if you go back.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.518
The girl is sick, not lonely.

06:53.640 --> 06:58.510
And you shouldn't go home until you
and Fred Vaughn are properly engaged.

06:58.600 --> 07:02.116
Yes, and until I've completed
all of my painting lessons of course.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.790
Ye... Oh, yes, yes.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.269
Of course.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.871
- Stop the carriage! Laurie!
- What are you doing?

07:17.960 --> 07:20.111
- Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!
- Amy!

07:20.200 --> 07:21.429
- Laurie!
- Amy!

07:22.120 --> 07:23.040
Amy!

07:23.960 --> 07:25.030
How are you?

07:25.120 --> 07:28.636
- You've grown so much.
- You wrote you'd meet me at the hotel.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.911
- I couldn't find you.
- You didn't look hard enough.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.515
- I didn't recognize you. You're so beautiful now.
- Stop it.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.696
- I thought you liked that.
- Where's your grandfather?

07:35.720 --> 07:38.997
In Germany. He's still traveling.
I'm traveling on my own now. Just relaxing.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.959
- Flirting and gambling and drinking.
- Yes. Don't tell your mother.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.032
Are you chasing some young girl
across Europe?

07:44.880 --> 07:45.880
No.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.234
I couldn't believe Jo turned you down.
I'm so sorry.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.315
Don't be, Amy. I... I'm not.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.440
Amy!

07:57.520 --> 07:58.715
Amy March!

07:58.800 --> 08:01.952
- Come back here right this instant! Come.
- Aunt March.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.269
Come on.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.556
- Aren't you looking grand?
- Get him off me!

08:05.640 --> 08:07.279
We need to be somewhere. Off you go!

08:07.360 --> 08:10.478
Come to the New Year's Eve party.
Everyone will be there, including Fred.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.200
Pick me up at the hotel at 8,
The Chavain. Oh...

08:13.280 --> 08:16.034
Oh, and, Laurie, dress for festivities!

08:16.120 --> 08:17.679
Top hats and silks!

08:17.760 --> 08:19.797
I will. I'll wear my best silk.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.880
It's Laurie.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.114
I know.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.791
Twenty yards of the blue silk, as well as pink.
Someone will be by for it later.

08:42.880 --> 08:47.272
Oh, Meg, that'd look lovely on you.
I know just the dressmaker to send you to.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.159
- You'll be the prettiest wife in Concord.
- Oh, I...

08:50.240 --> 08:53.472
John needs a new coat for winter,
and Daisy and Demi need new clothes, I...

08:53.560 --> 08:56.758
- And his wife needs a new dress.
- I can't. It's...

08:57.880 --> 08:58.880
I just can't.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.397
He'll be so pleased with how you look,
he'll forget all about the expense.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.471
I don't suppose it's too much
an extravagance.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.517
Will 20 yards do?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.557
- Yes.
- Very good.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.916
Fifty dollars? What was I thinking?

09:25.520 --> 09:27.239
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

09:29.520 --> 09:30.920
Oh, my loves.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.880
Go play.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.230
Beth!

10:08.160 --> 10:09.276
Beth?

10:09.360 --> 10:11.397
There lies your way, due west.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.312
Then westward ho!

10:13.400 --> 10:16.837
Grace and good disposition attend,
Your Ladyship.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.231
You'll nothing, madam,
to my lord by me?

10:20.320 --> 10:24.155
Stay, I prithee, tell me
what thou thinkest of me.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.199
That you do think you are not what you are.

10:27.280 --> 10:32.116
- If I think so, I think the same of you.
- Then think you right, I am not what I am.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.757
Like, a big one.
Like, a big one... Like that.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.750
Excuse me?

11:07.520 --> 11:10.194
I only speak English. I'm sorry, what?

11:10.280 --> 11:11.714
- What did you say?
- Come dance!

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
Oh!

12:05.600 --> 12:07.831
I know exactly who I wanna dance with.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.040
- Who will you dance with, Jo?
- I never dance.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.237
Why can't we all go? It's not fair.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.119
- Just wear your regular shoes.
- These fit last winter.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.317
My nose will not look refined.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.471
- I like your nose.
- Now, Jo.

12:21.560 --> 12:24.678
Don't touch me, thanks. I already
feel ridiculous. I don't wanna look it.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.355
- You could be pretty if you tried.
- Don't want to. Won't do it.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.830
I don't want to go,
but I wish I could hear the music.

12:29.920 --> 12:33.277
- I'll keep it in my head and sing it for you.
- Ought they to smoke like that?

12:33.360 --> 12:34.635
It's the dampness drying.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.598
What a queer smell, like burnt feathers.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.593
Now I'll take this off
and you'll see a perfect ringlet.

12:42.560 --> 12:43.755
Why is her hair off?

12:43.840 --> 12:46.435
- Meg, I'm so sorry.
- What have you done?!

12:47.441 --> 12:50.081
Sorry. You shouldn't have
asked me to do it.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.719
Marmee!

12:51.800 --> 12:53.712
I can't go, I'm spoiled!

12:53.800 --> 12:55.439
My hair!

12:55.560 --> 12:59.679
Don't stare, don't put your hands behind your back,
don't say "Christopher Columbus" or "capital."

12:59.760 --> 13:02.594
- All right.
- Don't shake hands. Don't whistle.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.479
Meg March, you look so pretty.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
Meg.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.480
Thank you.

13:28.240 --> 13:29.913
No, it's so early. No.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.150
Fine.

13:46.840 --> 13:51.312
- Ooh! Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here.
- Not at all. Stay if you like.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.869
- I won't disturb you?
- No. I don't know many people here.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.953
- I felt rather strange at first, you know?
- Mm-hm. So do I.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.119
- Miss March, isn't it?
- Yes, Mr. Laurence, but I'm not Miss March.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.034
- I'm only Jo.
- And I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.630
Don't you dance?

14:12.080 --> 14:15.756
I don't know how you do things here yet.
I've spent most of my life in Europe.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.593
Europe! Oh, that's capital!

14:19.000 --> 14:20.753
Shouldn't use words like that.

14:22.040 --> 14:26.000
- Says who?
- Oh, Meg. She's my older sister. Here.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.240
Um...

14:30.120 --> 14:31.793
Oh, that's her. See?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.592
- The girl in the violet dress.
- Mm.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.680
It's very pretty.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.552
She reminds me to be good,
so Father will be proud when he returns.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.040
Where is he?

14:44.120 --> 14:46.271
He volunteered for the Union Army.

14:46.400 --> 14:51.191
I wanted to go fight with him. I can't get over
my disappointment in being a girl.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.754
Jo, would you like to dance with me?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.113
I can't because... Mm.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.200
Because of what?

15:00.280 --> 15:02.431
- You won't tell?
- Never.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.111
I scorched my dress. See? There.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.431
Meg told me to keep still,
so no one would see it.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.191
You can laugh if you want to.
It's funny, I know.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.318
I have an idea of how we can manage.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.793
- What?
- My foot.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.280
- I've hurt my ankle.
- Oh!

16:18.360 --> 16:19.480
<i>How am I gonna get home?</i>

16:19.560 --> 16:22.758
I don't see what you can do, except get
a carriage or stay here all night.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.719
- Carriages are too expensive.
- Let me take you. It's right next door.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.598
Oh, no, thank you. We cannot accept.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.512
You must take mine, please?

16:29.600 --> 16:32.399
No. It's so early.
You can't mean to leave yet.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.517
I always leave early. I do, truly.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.080
What choice do you have, hm?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.576
- I told you those shoes were too small...
- Goodness gracious.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.600
What have you done?

16:41.640 --> 16:43.597
She's lame and can't walk.
She's hobbling.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.479
Clear that chair.
You're supposed to be asleep.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.517
All right, help your sister,
then back to bed.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.796
Make room. Meg is a wounded soldier.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.473
I sprained my ankle.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.951
Meg, you'll kill yourself
for fashion one of these days.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.397
Here. Hannah, we need ice!

16:59.480 --> 17:01.790
- Oh, come in. Come in.
- Is it all right?

17:01.880 --> 17:05.430
Apologies for the chaos.
I enjoy baking in the middle of the night.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.433
- Don't mind the clutter, Mr. Laurence. We don't.
- Laurie, please.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.549
- Can I call you Teddy?
- Yes.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.720
You must be part of their theatricals.
They could use an extra player.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.797
- I'm Amy.
- Hello.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.315
You'll have to fight Jo
for the male roles or play a girl.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.198
- Have a scone.
- Yes, thank you.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.555
And ice.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.997
- Laurie, how are your ankles? Do you need ice?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.595
Just call me "mother" or Marmee.
Everyone does.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.350
- And you wore those pink shoes too, didn't you?
- It's cold.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.393
- Do you want more ice?
- But they look so good, okay?

17:37.480 --> 17:40.720
It feels like being a fine young lady
to come home from a party in a carriage

17:40.760 --> 17:42.160
and have maids wait on me.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.436
<i>For the writer in the attic.</i>

18:54.520 --> 18:57.354
Because you enjoyed
the play so much tonight,

18:57.440 --> 18:59.079
I wanted you to have this.

19:00.280 --> 19:05.230
It will help you study character
and paint it with your pen.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.950
<i>I would love to read what you're writing,
if you'll trust me.</i>

19:09.440 --> 19:13.514
<i>I promise honesty and whatever
intelligence I can muster.</i>

19:14.080 --> 19:16.072
Yours, Friedrich.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.435
- Fred, would you like a glass?
- I will. Thank you.

19:48.040 --> 19:49.713
Would you excuse me a second?

19:56.960 --> 19:57.960
Laurie.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.075
Amy.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.719
I waited an hour for you.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.549
I feel caught.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.676
Hm...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.231
Amy, please. Amy.

20:11.320 --> 20:14.154
- Do you want to know what I think of you?
- What do you think of me?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.879
- I despise you.
- Why do you despise me?

20:15.960 --> 20:18.429
Because with every chance of being good,
happy and useful,

20:18.520 --> 20:20.989
- you are lazy, faulty and miserable.
- Ooh...

20:21.080 --> 20:23.595
- Interesting.
- Selfish people like to talk about themselves.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.036
- Am I selfish?
- Yes, very selfish.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.870
- With your money, talent, beauty, and health...
- Oh, you think I'm beautiful.

20:29.960 --> 20:31.474
Yes, you like that, you old vanity.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.712
With all these good things to enjoy,
you can find nothing to do but dawdle.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.391
- I'll be good for you, Saint Amy. I'll be good.
- Aren't you ashamed of a hand like that?

20:40.840 --> 20:41.840
No, I'm not.

20:41.841 --> 20:45.357
Looks like it's never done a day of work
in its life, and that ring is ridiculous.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.033
Jo gave me this ring.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.031
I feel sorry for you.
I really do.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.759
I just wish you'd bear it better.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.594
You don't have to feel sorry.
You'll feel the same way one day.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.434
No, I'd be respected
if I couldn't be loved.

21:00.560 --> 21:04.031
What have you done lately,
oh, great artiste?

21:05.360 --> 21:08.432
Perhaps you're fantasizing
about spending Fred Vaughn's fortune.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.591
Fred Vaughn, ladies and gentlemen!

21:19.160 --> 21:20.833
Fred, I...

21:20.920 --> 21:22.036
I'm so sorry.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.911
Those are just stories, of course.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.351
But I'm working on a novel.

21:46.040 --> 21:47.952
And your novel...

21:48.960 --> 21:50.360
it will be like this?

21:50.440 --> 21:51.440
Yes.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.552
So far, anyway.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.279
With plots like this?

21:56.640 --> 21:59.678
- Duels and killing and...
- It sells, so...

22:00.720 --> 22:04.430
- Why don't you sign your real name?
- My mother wouldn't like it.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.397
It's too gory for her.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.120
I wanna help with the money I make,
not worry her.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.120
Mm...

22:21.960 --> 22:24.316
You know, I don't like them.

22:26.640 --> 22:27.676
Honestly...

22:28.800 --> 22:31.554
I mean, I think that they're not good.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.320
Uh... But...

22:40.600 --> 22:41.600
They're...

22:43.600 --> 22:45.512
They're published in the papers,

22:45.600 --> 22:48.798
and people have always said that
I'm talented.

22:48.880 --> 22:51.111
Oh, I think you're talented.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.999
Which is why I'm being so...
So blunt.

22:56.240 --> 22:59.631
Well, I can't afford to starve
on praise.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.757
Are you upset?

23:01.840 --> 23:03.672
Of course I'm upset. You just...

23:03.760 --> 23:07.071
- You just told me you didn't like my work.
- Jo, I thought you wanted honesty.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.231
I... Yes, I do.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.119
Has no one ever talked to you
like this before?

23:14.280 --> 23:15.953
Yes, I've been rejected plenty
of times.

23:16.080 --> 23:20.279
Do you have anyone to take you seriously,
Jo, to talk about your work?

23:20.360 --> 23:23.273
And who made you high priest
of what's good and what's bad?

23:23.360 --> 23:26.114
- No one, and I'm not...
- Then why are you acting like it?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.776
Your reaction indicates that you must
think there is some truth...

23:28.800 --> 23:32.237
My reaction indicates that you are
a pompous blowhard.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.720
Shakespeare wrote for the masses.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.914
Shakespeare was the greatest poet who ever lived
because he smuggled his poetry in popular works.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.596
- I'm no Shakespeare.
- Thank goodness. We already have him.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.878
If you know so much about it,
then why don't you just do it yourself?

23:44.960 --> 23:47.316
Because I'm not a writer.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.313
- I don't have the gifts you have.
- No, you don't.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.040
You will always be a critic,
never an author.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.914
The world will forget that
you ever even lived.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.469
- Oh, I'm sure they will.
- But...

23:58.560 --> 23:59.710
I... But I...

24:01.520 --> 24:03.318
No one will forget Jo March.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.677
I can believe it.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.870
Listen.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.032
We are not friends.
You are not my friend.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.670
I don't want your opinion
because I don't like you very much.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.355
So just don't talk to me anymore.
Thank you.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.640
Oh, Josephine, this came for you.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.915
Oh, thank you.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.080
Beth.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.199
Merry Christmas, world.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.479
Merry Christmas!

25:47.560 --> 25:50.155
- Merry Christmas.
- Beth, give me another orange.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.709
- Jo, we've been up for hours.
- What have you been writing?

25:52.840 --> 25:55.992
Oh, I got carried away
with our delicious revenge play last night, <i>Poison.</i>

25:56.080 --> 25:58.072
No, no poison. It's Christmas.

25:58.240 --> 26:01.551
- Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.
- It's so dreadful being poor.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.230
It's not fair. How come some girls have pretty things
and others have nothing at all?

26:05.360 --> 26:09.479
- We have Father, Mother and each other.
- We haven't got Father for as long as this war drags on.

26:09.600 --> 26:13.116
I wish I had heaps of money and plenty
of servants, so I never had to work again.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.591
Or you could be a proper actress on the boards.
They aren't all fallen women.

26:16.720 --> 26:18.154
I can't be an actress.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.199
I have lots of wishes, but my favorite one
is to be an artist in Paris

26:21.280 --> 26:24.000
and to do fine pictures and to be
the best painter in the world.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.549
That's what you want too, isn't it, Jo?
Be a famous writer?

26:26.640 --> 26:29.872
- Yes, but it sounds crass when she says it.
- Why be ashamed of what you want?

26:29.960 --> 26:33.192
My wish is to have us all to be together
with Father and Mother in this house.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.516
- That's what I want.
- Beth is perfect.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.656
- Amy.
- What about your music, Queen Beth, huh?

26:37.680 --> 26:41.435
- I do that for us. I don't need anyone else to hear it.
- You must not limit yourself.

26:41.560 --> 26:45.600
Mother proposed not having any presents this year
because our men are suffering in the Army.

26:45.680 --> 26:49.151
We can't do much, but we can make
our little sacrifices and do it gladly.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.960
Don't play mother just
because she's not home.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.714
- Jo, that's so boyish.
- That's why I do it.

26:54.840 --> 26:58.277
- I detest rude, unladylike girls.
- I hate affected little chits.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.920
- Jo!
- My nose! My nose!

27:01.000 --> 27:03.037
It's already no good!

27:03.120 --> 27:04.315
Jo! Jo!

27:04.440 --> 27:08.639
I know you don't care what I think, but you don't
want your mother to find you like this, do you?

27:08.720 --> 27:12.031
- We care what you think, Hannah.
- You're more family than wicked old Aunt March.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.077
- Oh, don't, Jo.
- Where is Marmee? I'm starving.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.073
Goodness only knows.
Some poor creature came a-begging.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.595
Your ma set off to see what was needed.

27:19.720 --> 27:24.317
- I wish she could help others at a time convenient to us.
- Joanna and I are very hungry.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.914
Dolls don't get hungry, Beth.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.312
I've rewritten the climax. We need to
set it to memory. Amy, get the costumes.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.437
I have made the most divine crown,

27:31.520 --> 27:34.354
and I painted my old shoes blue,
so she looks like a princess!

27:34.480 --> 27:38.235
- The melancholy piece I've figured out is pretty good.
- Wait until you see this new speech.

27:38.360 --> 27:42.115
I don't see how you can write such splendid things, Jo.
You're a regular Shakespeare.

27:42.200 --> 27:45.671
Not quite. Miss Michelangelo,
can you please rehearse the fainting scene?

27:45.760 --> 27:47.717
- You're as stiff as a poker.
- I can't help it.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.510
I never saw anyone faint before.
I don't intend to make myself all black and blue.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.193
If I can fall down easily, I'll drop.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.875
And if I cannot,
I shall fall gracefully into a chair.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.680
And I don't care if Hugo comes
at me with a pistol.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.400
- Hannah?
- I'm not acting.

28:00.520 --> 28:03.991
- I didn't even say anything.
- I knew what you were going to say, and I'm not acting.

28:13.640 --> 28:17.236
I need both of you
to kneel right there.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.280
- I need you to kneel.
- I don't want to kneel.

28:19.360 --> 28:22.831
This is supposed to be our special scene,
and no one's gonna be looking at us.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.320
- Smile.
- I don't want to.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.995
You have to. And I think
Meg should be the director.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.436
So I think that
she'll need to kneel...

28:29.560 --> 28:31.760
- But it's our scene.
- If you'll kneel and look...

28:31.800 --> 28:33.234
Merry Christmas, girls.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.437
- Marmee!
- Oh, merry Christmas!

28:35.520 --> 28:39.036
I'm so glad to see you so happy.
How's your play?

28:39.120 --> 28:41.954
Jo, you look tired. Were you up
again all night writing?

28:42.040 --> 28:44.475
- Of course.
- Amy, come kiss me. Thank you.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.994
Merry Christmas.
How are my girls?

28:47.120 --> 28:48.679
- I'm so hungry.
- Look at this.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.195
- I could eat a horse.
- Don't say that, Jo.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.200
What?

28:55.840 --> 28:56.840
What is it?

28:57.960 --> 29:00.839
Not far from here lives
a poor young woman, Mrs. Hummel.

29:00.960 --> 29:05.796
Her five children are in one bed to keep
from freezing, and there's nothing to eat.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.237
Will you give them your breakfast
as a Christmas present?

29:14.240 --> 29:16.596
Is this where you say that
Father would want us to?

29:17.640 --> 29:18.640
Yes.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.193
Thank you.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.671
And thank you, Mr. Laurence,
for including me.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.830
You're welcome.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.638
Perhaps you could tutor
my grandson in manners,

29:43.760 --> 29:45.752
as well as mathematics, huh?

29:53.560 --> 29:54.676
Oh, girls...

29:57.240 --> 29:58.240
Be careful.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.717
Watch yourselves.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.632
Out here with no sleeves.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.076
It is good angels come to us.

30:25.520 --> 30:26.840
Hello.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.152
I'm back. And have food
and blankets.

30:30.240 --> 30:31.640
And sweaters.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.439
And we brought some medicine.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.279
So these are my girls.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.476
Say hello.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.640
He is not well.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.677
Girls, why don't you
unpack the food?

30:41.160 --> 30:42.389
Would you like some?

30:46.480 --> 30:47.516
You want one?

30:48.440 --> 30:49.590
Yeah, have it all.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.240
- Why don't we put some firewood?
- It's good, isn't it?

30:55.640 --> 30:56.790
That's nice, huh?

31:02.680 --> 31:05.957
- Marmee, we don't need our toes.
- I think I've lost one.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.872
Has anyone else lost their toe?

31:09.800 --> 31:13.077
- That was amazing.
- I can't even feel my feet anymore.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.837
Is it fairies?

31:16.920 --> 31:18.036
Santa Claus.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.635
- No, it's old Aunt March.
- Mr. Laurence sent it.

31:20.720 --> 31:23.110
- The Laurence boy's grandfather?
- Yes.

31:23.200 --> 31:24.120
Why?

31:24.121 --> 31:27.831
He saw you giving your Christmas breakfast
away and he wanted you to enjoy the day.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.816
- But I thought he was a mean old man.
- It's so generous of him.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.992
His grandson, Laurie, put the idea
into his head. I know he did.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.998
We should make friends with him.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.272
Boys scare me, and that big old
house scares me.

31:39.400 --> 31:43.474
Jenny Snow says that Mr. Laurence disowned his son
after he went off with an Italian woman.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.358
Now his grandson is an orphan

31:45.440 --> 31:48.274
and spends all of his time in that house,
locked up with his tutor.

31:48.360 --> 31:52.240
He's a very kind man who lost his little girl
when she was only a child.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.152
- Now his son as well.
- His daughter died?

31:54.280 --> 31:57.910
- That's so sad.
- But doesn't Laurie just seem so romantic? He's half Italian.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.976
What do you know?
You've barely spoken to him. Ow!

32:00.000 --> 32:03.198
I'm not responsible for this feast,
but I have got a surprise.

32:04.201 --> 32:05.953
- Is he coming home?
- A letter from Father!

32:06.560 --> 32:08.153
Don't I wish I could go?

32:08.280 --> 32:10.511
Jo, we can't give up
our only brother.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.592
It must be so disagreeable
to sleep in a tent.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.479
- Jo sits in the back, so we can't see her cry.
- So, what if I do?

32:15.560 --> 32:19.110
- Will he be coming home?
- He'll stay and work faithfully as long as he can.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.671
And we won't ask for him to come back
a minute sooner than he can be spared.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.756
"Give them all my dear love and a kiss.

32:26.880 --> 32:30.794
Tell them I think of them by day,
pray for them by night

32:30.880 --> 32:33.952
and find my best comforts
in their affection at all times.

32:34.040 --> 32:37.477
A year seems a very long time
to wait before I see them.

32:37.880 --> 32:42.830
But remind them that while we wait,
we may all work, so these hard days...

32:42.920 --> 32:44.798
need not be wasted.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.354
<i>I know that they will be
loving children to you.</i>

32:49.680 --> 32:51.433
<i>Do their duty faithfully.</i>

32:52.640 --> 32:54.438
<i>Fight their enemies bravely.</i>

32:56.320 --> 32:58.960
<i>And conquer themselves
so beautifully."</i>

32:59.080 --> 33:01.993
<i>The Witch's Curse,</i>
a play by Jo March.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.279
Make it sweet and swift
and strong...

33:06.360 --> 33:10.274
<i>- "That when I come back to them..."</i>
- Spirit, answer now my song.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.360
<i>"...I may be...</i>

33:12.880 --> 33:15.554
<i>fonder and prouder than ever...</i>

33:17.160 --> 33:18.799
<i>of my little women."</i>

33:20.320 --> 33:21.674
B rava!

33:25.320 --> 33:27.880
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.671
Excuse me. Your stop, ma'am.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.831
Oh, thank you.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.877
<i>She's gone? Why?</i>

33:34.960 --> 33:37.270
I don't know. She just left.

33:37.360 --> 33:41.115
- But she didn't say if she was coming back?
- We didn't have a heart-to-heart, professor.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.830
Why are you just sitting there?
Please, go, go. Dust something.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.919
And what about the girls?
She was the best teacher they ever had.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
I know.

34:00.800 --> 34:04.032
<i>It is so hard to go back
to work after such good times.</i>

34:04.120 --> 34:07.352
- I wish it was Christmas every day.
- Or New Year's. Wouldn't that be exciting?

34:07.480 --> 34:09.597
We are a bunch of ungrateful minxes.

34:09.679 --> 34:13.196
- Jo! Don't say such despicable things.
- I like good, strong words that mean something.

34:13.360 --> 34:16.114
- I have to go back to school, and I don't have any limes.
- Limes?

34:16.239 --> 34:20.359
All the girls are trading pickled limes,
and I'm in debt. I owe ever so many limes.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.079
- Will this do?
- What'd you do that for?

34:22.159 --> 34:23.355
Meg, thank you.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.956
I know what it is to want little things
and feel less than other girls.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.350
- That and the drawings will wipe out my debt.
- Drawings?

34:29.440 --> 34:32.717
Nothing. I'm just glad Mother doesn't
make me go to school with those girls.

34:32.840 --> 34:33.989
Hurry. I'll be late.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.830
Beth, after your shopping, I need you to work
your way through the new sums and spelling.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.116
- I'll check it all when I get home, all right?
- Fine.

34:40.199 --> 34:41.199
Bye.

34:59.920 --> 35:00.920
Ooh!

35:02.400 --> 35:04.153
- Josephine.
- Yes?

35:04.720 --> 35:07.679
- Oh... Josephine.
- Yes? Here.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.559
Is there a reason
you stopped reading Belsham?

35:11.640 --> 35:12.710
I'm sorry.

35:12.800 --> 35:13.870
I'll continue.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.034
You mind yourself, deary.

35:17.120 --> 35:20.909
Someday you'll need me
and you'll wish you had behaved better.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.879
Thank you, Aunt March, for your employment
and your many kindnesses,

35:23.960 --> 35:26.350
but I intend to make my way in the world.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.954
Oh, well.

35:28.040 --> 35:30.600
No. No one makes their own way.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.160
Not really.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.438
Least of all, a woman.
You'll need to marry well.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.319
- But you are not married.
- That's because I'm rich.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.631
And I made sure
to keep hold of my money.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.157
Unlike your father.

35:43.240 --> 35:46.199
So the only way to be
an unmarried woman is to be rich?

35:46.280 --> 35:47.200
Yes.

35:47.201 --> 35:50.831
- There are precious few ways for women to make money.
- That's not true.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.713
You could run a cathouse.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.951
Or go on the stage.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.157
Practically the same thing.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.311
Other than that, you're right.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.517
Precious few ways for women.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.832
- That's why you should heed me.
- So I can get married.

36:04.920 --> 36:09.278
No. So you can live a better life
than your poor mother has.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.910
- But Marmee loves her life.
- You don't know what she loves.

36:14.560 --> 36:19.430
Your father cared more about educating freedmen's children
than he did about caring for his own family.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.000
Yes, but he was right.

36:21.080 --> 36:24.391
Well, it's possible
to be right and foolish.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.834
Well, I don't think so.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.798
Well, you're not paid to think.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.239
I know you don't care much
about marriage now.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.114
Can't say I blame you.

36:42.360 --> 36:48.470
But I intend to go to Europe one more time
and I need a companion,

36:48.600 --> 36:50.796
so how would you like
to be the person I take?

36:51.160 --> 36:54.517
- I'd like that more than anything.
- All right, then read.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.112
And don't sneak around.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.639
I don't like sneaks.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.600
<i>President Lincoln.</i>

37:03.601 --> 37:05.159
No, Father's fighting for him.

37:05.240 --> 37:08.870
My father says the war is a waste
and we should just let them keep their labor.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.440
Susan, it is immoral.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.558
Everyone benefited from the system,
including you Marches.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.678
- Why should only the South be punished?
- Maybe we should all be punished.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.436
- The Marches love a cause.
- Fine. Just do Mr. Davis.

37:22.760 --> 37:27.152
- I don't know if I should.
- I'll wipe out your debt and give you five limes.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.960
...your spelling and, moreover, your reading habit.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.750
Miss March.

37:48.880 --> 37:49.880
<i>Sit down.</i>

37:51.360 --> 37:53.238
Sit down, Laurie.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.439
Latin is a privilege.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.318
Please, you have to learn this.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.154
I can't afford to lose this position.
Just return to the Cicero...

38:00.240 --> 38:02.391
- There's a girl out there.
- No, there is not.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.473
- Yes, Mr. Brooke, there is a girl.
- No, there's not.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.676
I'll never get to go home again.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.717
- There is a girl.
- That's a girl.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.312
Hello there. Are you hurt?

38:19.440 --> 38:22.160
- I'm Amy.
- Hello, Amy. I'm Laurie.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.800
I know. You brought my sister back
after the dance.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.951
I would've never have
sprained my ankle.

38:27.040 --> 38:29.953
I have lovely small feet,
the best in the family.

38:30.040 --> 38:34.512
But I can never go home again
because I'm in such trouble.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.314
Look.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.792
Mr. Davis hit me.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.317
Tell the servants I want this
painting purchased for me.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.960
- Amy! Are you in here?
- Meg! My hand. Look.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.520
- Jo.
- What richness.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.954
It hurts so much.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.236
You ought to be the happiest boy
in the world.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.232
- A fellow can't live on books alone.
- I could.

38:55.320 --> 38:59.030
- What did you do?
- I did a drawing, and then Mr. Davis hit me.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.874
- Oh, Christopher Columbus, look at that.
- That's my grandfather.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.350
- Are you scared of him?
- No, I'm not scared of anyone.

39:04.440 --> 39:07.160
He looks stern, but my grandfather
was much more handsome.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.033
Jo, we do not compare grandfathers.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.157
- You think he's more handsome, eh?
- Oh...

39:12.160 --> 39:16.359
- No, actually, you are very handsome. I didn't mean...
- I knew your mother's father.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.353
You've got his spirit.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.231
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

39:23.920 --> 39:27.516
- You are not to attend that school anymore.
- Good. That man has always been an idiot.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.160
- Jo will teach you.
- Me? I already teach Beth.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.240
You're a good teacher.

39:31.320 --> 39:34.279
Yes, women being taught at home
is much more proper, I believe.

39:34.400 --> 39:38.030
- Only because the schools for women are so poor.
- Indeed. Quite right.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.874
I wish all the girls would leave his school
and that he would die.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.296
- Amy, you did wrong and there'll be consequences.
- I didn't even do anything. I just did a drawing.

39:45.320 --> 39:48.950
- Thank you so much for taking care of Amy.
- Oh, yes, of course.

39:49.040 --> 39:51.714
My girls have a way of getting
into mischief.

39:51.800 --> 39:52.995
Well, so do I.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.436
Then you'll run over
and we'll take care of you.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.910
Come over whenever you'd like.
Invite Beth as well.

39:58.040 --> 40:01.272
- Yes! Beth would adore the piano.
- Is she the quiet one?

40:01.360 --> 40:02.680
Yes, that's our Beth.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.355
- Tell that little girl to use our piano.
- Thank you.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.159
Jo, borrow whatever book you'd like.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.072
- Can I come look at the paintings?
- Yes.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.879
There's also a lovely greenhouse.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.515
We must go. Girls.

40:13.680 --> 40:18.038
- Mr. Laurence, can you please buy this painting?
- I'm going to take this. If that's okay.

40:18.120 --> 40:20.616
- I'll bring it back soon. I promise you.
- Thank you again.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.960
Thank you for my hand!

40:22.040 --> 40:23.554
- Thank you!
- Goodbye.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.680
Oh, Miss Meg?

40:29.120 --> 40:30.759
You forgot your glove.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.678
Well, back to work.

40:41.760 --> 40:42.955
Back to work.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.030
Order!

41:00.120 --> 41:03.352
Order. Order. Order!

41:03.480 --> 41:08.555
A new play written by Miss Jo March
will appear at the Barnville Theater

41:08.640 --> 41:11.712
in the course of the next few weeks
that will surpass

41:11.800 --> 41:15.680
anything ever seen before
on the American stage.

41:15.760 --> 41:20.471
Starring the greatest actress from here
to the Mississippi River, Miss Meg March.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.553
Yes. There we go. Very good.
Excellent. Bravo.

41:23.640 --> 41:27.111
- Weekly report. Meg good, Jo bad.
- Mm-hm.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.591
Beth very good.
And Amy sort of middling.

41:30.680 --> 41:32.797
- Very well done, sirs.
- Excellent.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.951
- Excellent, excellent.
- Bravo.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.872
Mr. President and gentlemen,

41:36.960 --> 41:39.919
I wish to propose the admission
of a new member.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.357
One who would be deeply,
deeply grateful

41:43.440 --> 41:48.390
and would add immensely
to the spirit of the club.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.880
I propose...

41:51.360 --> 41:54.239
Mr. Theodore Laurence!

41:55.281 --> 41:56.715
- Absolutely not.
- No.

41:56.800 --> 41:59.838
- What? Come, now. Let's have him.
- He's a real boy.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.879
- We don't want any boys. This is a club for ladies.
- Yes.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.314
- I think we should do it.
- Why?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.312
- Even if we are afraid, I say yes.
- Why?

42:06.400 --> 42:07.834
- It's Laurie.
- What? No.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.110
It'll change everything.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.510
I call a vote. Put your hands up.
"Aye, aye, aye."

42:11.600 --> 42:14.320
- Don't put her hand up.
- Put your hand up. It's Laurie.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.629
Fine. Aye.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.592
And as there is no time
like the present...

42:19.040 --> 42:21.350
Ladies, ladies,
please, please.

42:21.440 --> 42:26.595
This is my stratagem. I deserve the blame.
Jo only gave in to it after lots of teasing.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.034
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

42:28.120 --> 42:32.558
I merely wish to say as a slight token
of my gratitude that I...

42:34.360 --> 42:35.396
- Yes, yes.
- Go on.

42:35.480 --> 42:40.077
As a means of promoting friendly relations
between adjoining nations.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.159
- And thus, I propose this set of keys
- Ooh!

42:43.240 --> 42:47.951
for a little post office I've made
in the forest by the pond.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.874
- Yes, four keys. They're for you, darling.
- Ooh!

42:50.960 --> 42:54.954
- Meg, yes, yes. And for you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.839
This is for me. And without further ado,
thank you for your favor.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.957
I will take my seat
as part of the club.

43:02.120 --> 43:06.990
- Yes, well. Of course. Yes, yes.
- Bravo, bravo.

43:08.280 --> 43:09.953
Welcome, Laurie.

43:22.920 --> 43:25.833
- Three, four, five.
- You both got five.

43:25.920 --> 43:28.196
- I asked the doctor.
- That's a draw, I think.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.034
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know. I can't believe it.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.474
Hello.

43:32.560 --> 43:33.596
Jo!

43:39.000 --> 43:41.356
Daisy and Demi! Can I have a hug?

43:41.440 --> 43:43.193
Oh, you've gotten so big.

43:44.760 --> 43:47.753
- I wish you were here to teach them.
- I know. Well, I'm here now.

43:47.840 --> 43:50.036
- So good to have you home.
- Take this off.

43:50.120 --> 43:53.909
I think the loneliness got to Beth,
though she ain't said anything.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.357
- Where is Beth?
- She's upstairs. Oh, my Jo.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.872
We all thought she was better,
but the fever'd weakened her heart.

44:03.080 --> 44:05.879
Take this and find her
the best doctor you can.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.800
- You need this money to live in New York.
- No, I'm not going back.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.475
I'm using the rest to take her
to the sea and get her strong.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.434
When's Amy coming home?

44:17.520 --> 44:20.354
- We didn't want to worry her.
- Does she not know?

44:22.920 --> 44:27.153
Beth insisted we not tell her
because she didn't want to ruin Amy's trip.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.672
Amy has always had a talent
for getting out of the hard parts of life.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.911
Jo, don't be angry with your sister.

44:45.520 --> 44:47.671
I can't seem to find anything.

44:47.760 --> 44:51.197
- Marmee, have you seen my glove?
- When did you last see it?

44:53.200 --> 44:56.113
Jo! Jo, where are you?

44:56.200 --> 44:58.192
- I can't find my other glove.
- Take mine.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.511
- Jo, we're going to be late.
- Where are you going?

45:00.600 --> 45:02.080
You're not invited.

45:02.160 --> 45:06.279
- You're going somewhere with Laurie. I know it.
- Yes, we are. Now, stop bothering.

45:06.360 --> 45:08.016
- You have the tickets?
- Yes. Hurry up.

45:08.040 --> 45:11.351
You're going to the theater with Laurie.
Meg, can I come? Please, can I come?

45:11.520 --> 45:15.400
- I'm sorry, but you weren't invited.
- You can't go, so don't be a baby and whine about it.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.870
I've been shut up here,
and I never get to go anywhere.

45:17.960 --> 45:21.510
- Beth has her piano, and I'm lonely.
- I can teach you chords.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.876
I don't want chords.
I want to go to the theater.

45:23.960 --> 45:26.794
No. I think you'd hate to poke yourself
in where you're not wanted.

45:26.880 --> 45:30.157
- We already have to deal with dull Mr. Brooke.
- I like him. He's kind.

45:30.240 --> 45:32.880
- But I can pay for myself.
- You will not come.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.798
I'm sorry, my sweet, but Jo is right.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.314
- No! Please.
- Next time.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.518
- Come, Meg. Stop petting her.
- Please, please, please!

45:39.600 --> 45:42.069
- You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!
- Amy!

45:42.160 --> 45:44.550
You will! You'll regret this!

45:47.400 --> 45:49.517
Stop looking at me like that!

46:37.640 --> 46:38.710
Oh, uh...

46:43.400 --> 46:45.631
- I loved every second of it.
- Ow. Jo!

46:45.720 --> 46:49.873
- I thought the actress was...
- Very, very good.

46:49.960 --> 46:53.192
- Yes, she was really good.
- She was. She was very good.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.914
Bye!

47:11.000 --> 47:13.071
Oh, I love the theater.

47:13.160 --> 47:17.473
Meg, you're a million times better than she was.
Although she was a terrific fainter.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.756
I wonder how she managed
to turn so white as she did.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.236
That Mr. Brooke, could he be
any more obsequious?

47:22.360 --> 47:26.070
- I thought he was very well-mannered.
- Hold on. Let me just get this idea down.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.996
- Beth, what's your favorite eye color?
- Purple.

47:35.160 --> 47:39.154
Mr. Brooke has blue eyes and an old soul,
which is much more important than money.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.754
Has anyone taken my novel?

47:41.600 --> 47:43.193
- No.
- No. Why?

47:54.160 --> 47:55.833
Amy, you've got it.

47:55.920 --> 47:57.639
- No, I haven't.
- That's a lie.

47:57.720 --> 48:00.280
I haven't got it, I don't know
where it is, and I don't care.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.999
Tell me, or I'll make you!

48:02.080 --> 48:04.197
- I burnt it up!
- Marmee!

48:04.280 --> 48:08.479
I burnt your book. I told you
I'd make you pay, and I did!

48:08.560 --> 48:11.120
All right, Jo! Jo! Jo!
Please get off her!

48:11.240 --> 48:12.833
Jo. Amy.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.832
- Get her off!
- I hate you!

48:21.880 --> 48:23.280
I'm sorry, Jo.

48:24.760 --> 48:25.760
Amy.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.880
It's just that the only thing
you care about is your writing.

48:34.960 --> 48:38.351
And it's not as if I could've hurt you
by ruining one of your dresses,

48:38.440 --> 48:40.352
and I really did want
to hurt you.

48:42.240 --> 48:45.233
I am the most sorry for it now.
I'm so sorry.

48:46.720 --> 48:47.720
Jo...

48:48.360 --> 48:50.875
don't let the sun go down
on your anger.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.679
Forgive her.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.080
Help each other.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.993
And you begin again tomorrow.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.356
She doesn't deserve my forgiveness.

49:01.880 --> 49:05.396
And I will hate her.
I will hate her forever!

49:36.440 --> 49:38.636
Good morning.
Brisk and brilliant outside today.

49:38.720 --> 49:40.536
- Last day at the river. Get your skates.
- Let's go!

49:40.560 --> 49:43.394
Jo, you promised me
I could come last time. Jo!

49:46.280 --> 49:48.192
Is she going
to be like this forever?

49:49.280 --> 49:51.351
It was a very hard loss for her.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.591
Is there nothing I can do?

49:55.840 --> 50:00.232
Go after her. Don't say anything
till Jo has got good-natured with Laurie,

50:00.320 --> 50:02.312
and then just say some kind thing.

50:02.400 --> 50:03.959
I'm sure she'll be friends again.

50:04.920 --> 50:06.957
Jo, wait!

50:07.040 --> 50:08.872
I'm coming!

50:08.960 --> 50:11.191
You said I could come last time!

50:13.960 --> 50:16.111
Jo, Laurie, wait! I'm coming!

50:17.080 --> 50:18.150
Wait!

50:19.560 --> 50:20.880
Jo!

50:20.960 --> 50:23.236
Stay near the edge.
It's not safe in the middle.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.118
- Got it.
- Jo!

50:29.600 --> 50:31.159
Jo, I'm coming!

50:33.560 --> 50:34.960
Woo-hoo-hoo!

50:36.560 --> 50:37.710
Jo!

50:39.800 --> 50:41.029
Jo, let's go!

50:46.360 --> 50:47.680
Jo, wait!

50:55.320 --> 50:56.320
Jo!

51:06.480 --> 51:07.960
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

51:08.040 --> 51:11.511
- Help! Help me!
- Amy. It's Amy.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.159
Come on. Come on, Jo.

51:13.240 --> 51:14.240
Jo!

51:15.240 --> 51:16.240
Jo!

51:17.840 --> 51:19.718
Jo, get a branch. Get a branch.

51:20.240 --> 51:21.720
- Amy.
- Jo!

51:21.800 --> 51:23.678
Amy. Amy.

51:23.760 --> 51:24.760
Help!

51:24.840 --> 51:26.354
I can't breathe!

51:26.440 --> 51:30.559
Jo, help me pull.
Amy, grab the branch. Grab it, Amy.

51:40.640 --> 51:43.678
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my sister, my sister.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.154
She's asleep.

51:53.400 --> 51:55.392
If she had died,
it would have been my fault.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.360
She'll be fine.

51:59.480 --> 52:02.996
The doctor said that he didn't
even think she'd catch cold.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.113
What is wrong with me?

52:07.200 --> 52:08.998
I've made so many resolutions,

52:09.080 --> 52:12.835
and I've written sad notes,
and I've cried over my sins...

52:14.720 --> 52:17.189
but it just doesn't seem to help.

52:18.960 --> 52:22.874
When I get in a passion,
I get so savage.

52:22.960 --> 52:25.429
I could hurt anyone,
and I'd enjoy it.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.598
You remind me of myself.

52:30.800 --> 52:32.234
But you're never angry.

52:33.560 --> 52:36.075
I'm angry nearly every day
of my life.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.360
You are?

52:39.520 --> 52:41.591
I am not patient by nature.

52:42.880 --> 52:46.237
But with nearly 40 years of effort,

52:46.320 --> 52:48.789
I'm learning to not let it
get the better of me.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.839
Well, I'll do the same, then.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.514
I hope you'll do
a great deal better than me.

53:01.080 --> 53:05.518
There are some natures
too noble to curb

53:05.600 --> 53:07.910
and too lofty to bend.

53:28.760 --> 53:29.760
Jo.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.594
Oh, Beth, my love. Oh.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.832
- You didn't need to come.
- I never should have left.

53:38.920 --> 53:41.560
Do you need anything? Here.

53:41.640 --> 53:42.960
Take some water.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.592
It's so good to see your face.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.155
We're going to the sea to get you strong and well.

53:52.240 --> 53:55.358
- The sea?
- I want you dancing by the time Amy gets back.

53:56.360 --> 53:59.034
- She's not cutting her trip short, is she?
- No, no.

53:59.120 --> 54:00.315
Good.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.869
Is there any news?
What does she say?

54:02.960 --> 54:05.111
She writes that Laurie is there.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.600
I'm glad he's with her.

54:07.880 --> 54:10.111
He won't respond
to any of my letters.

54:11.440 --> 54:12.715
Do you miss him?

54:14.280 --> 54:15.555
I miss everything.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.600
I know.

54:22.920 --> 54:25.736
- Hurry up, you two! Meg's gonna be gone for a week.
- We're coming!

54:25.760 --> 54:27.956
You take the other carriage,
Laurie, and spy on Meg.

54:28.040 --> 54:29.918
- Make sure she doesn't fall in love.
- I will.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.515
It was nice of Annie to invite me
to her debutante ball.

54:32.600 --> 54:35.752
- Thank you for letting me go.
- Just be who you are.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.720
And wear this to the ball.
It was mine when I was your age.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.474
I've never understood saving
jewelry until marriage.

54:42.560 --> 54:46.998
You should have something that's just yours.
Pretty things should be enjoyed.

54:47.080 --> 54:49.276
Yes, pretty things
should be enjoyed.

54:50.680 --> 54:51.716
- Can I see it?
- Hannah!

54:51.800 --> 54:53.678
I wish I could
go to the debutante ball.

54:53.760 --> 54:56.798
Do you think this is a good idea,
her going away like this?

54:56.880 --> 55:00.191
Girls have to go into the world
and make up their own minds about things.

55:00.280 --> 55:03.000
- Don't forget about us.
- I won't, Jo. It's only a week.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.992
- It's beautiful.
- It's not yours.

55:05.080 --> 55:08.596
- It would look very good on me.
- She needs to have some decent shoes.

55:08.680 --> 55:13.197
Thank you for the carriage, Mr. Laurence.
I don't know how to repay you.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.634
Nonsense, nonsense.

55:14.720 --> 55:18.111
- I said hi to the horses. They're very nice.
- Although there is one thing.

55:18.240 --> 55:22.553
It occurred to me today that my daughter's
piano suffers from want of use.

55:22.640 --> 55:26.475
Any of your girls like to run over
and practice on it now and then?

55:26.560 --> 55:31.191
Just to keep it in tune. If they don't care
to come, why, then never mind.

55:31.280 --> 55:34.239
Oh, sir, they do care.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.436
Very, very much.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.035
- You're the musical girl?
- I love it dearly.

55:39.120 --> 55:43.672
And I'll come if you are quite sure
nobody will hear me and be disturbed.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.513
Not a soul, my dear.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.916
- Miss you.
- Bye.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.354
- Can I borrow your ribbons?
- No.

55:53.280 --> 55:55.112
- Bye!
- Be good. Enjoy the ball.

55:55.200 --> 55:58.079
- Bye. I'll be back soon.
- Don't go and get married.

55:58.160 --> 55:59.230
Don't go fall in love.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.720
- Come back right now.
- I love you.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.917
- Right this second.
- Right this second.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.520
Whoa there.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.640
Thank you.

56:47.240 --> 56:49.391
I'd be so excited about tonight.

56:50.760 --> 56:53.514
- Of course.
- Oh, no, I don't actually...

56:55.440 --> 56:57.511
What dress will
you wear tonight, Meg?

56:57.640 --> 57:00.997
- I will wear this one.
- That one? Can't you send home for another?

57:01.080 --> 57:03.640
- I haven't got another.
- Only the one? Oh, that's so funny.

57:03.720 --> 57:04.995
Not at all.

57:05.080 --> 57:09.518
There's no need in sending home, Daisy.
I'm going to call you Daisy now.

57:09.640 --> 57:13.160
I've got a sweet pink dress laid away,
and you'll wear it to please me, won't you, Daisy?

57:14.120 --> 57:16.237
- If it's all right.
- Of course.

57:53.800 --> 57:55.473
Everyone's in love with you, Daisy.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.200
- You have to keep my dress.
- I can't keep your dress.

57:58.280 --> 57:59.680
- You have to. Please.
- No.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.114
I love seeing you in it.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.353
Have fun, little Daisy.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.955
Laurie. I didn't know
you were going to come.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.679
Supposed to be a surprise.

58:09.760 --> 58:12.594
And what a lovely surprise
it is.

58:12.680 --> 58:15.639
- Why are they calling you Daisy?
- It's their pet name for me.

58:17.920 --> 58:19.832
Meg is a perfectly good name.

58:19.920 --> 58:24.517
It's just like playing a part
to be Daisy for a little while.

58:29.160 --> 58:30.514
What would Jo say?

58:35.520 --> 58:38.035
You wouldn't actually marry
one of these men, would you?

58:40.200 --> 58:41.236
I might.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.353
You'll get a terrible headache tomorrow.

58:50.200 --> 58:51.600
Do you like how I look?

58:51.680 --> 58:53.160
No, I don't.

58:54.520 --> 58:55.954
Why not?

58:56.040 --> 58:57.997
I don't like fuss and feathers.

58:59.240 --> 59:01.197
You're the rudest boy I ever saw.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.032
Please forgive me and come dance.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.200
I'm afraid it would be
too disagreeable for you.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.792
I don't like your dress,
but I think you are just splendid.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.637
- Really?
- Really.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:55.435
I know it's silly,
but please don't tell Jo.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.037
Let me have my fun tonight. I'll be
desperately good for the rest of my life.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.995
I'm sorry, John.

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.954
The silk was
the first real expense.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.555
Ahem. Fifty dollars, while a lot,
is not, I suppose,

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.431
too much for a dress with all the notions
that are needed to finish it these days.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.720
It's not exactly even a dress yet.
It's...

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.394
It's just the fabric.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.360
Oh.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320
I see.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.599
I know you're angry, John.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.876
I don't mean to waste your money,
but I can't resist

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.317
when I see Sallie buying all she wants
and pitying me because I don't.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.312
I try to be contented,
but it is hard.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.676
And I'm tired of being poor.

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.194
I was afraid of this.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.198
I do my best, Meg.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:32.760
Oh, John.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.992
My dear, kind, hardworking boy.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.754
It was so ungrateful and wicked.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.679
How could I say it?

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.992
- Perhaps you meant it.
- No, I didn't.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.470
We'll work out a way to get
you your coat as well,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.519
and then won't we be grand,
the two of us?

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.239
I can't afford it, my dear.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.072
- John.
- I need to go to bed.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.280
John.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.918
And I really am very sorry that you've had
to do without so many beautiful things...

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.717
and that you're married to someone
who can't give them to you.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.400
Hello, Amy.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.153
I don't want to see you.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.074
Don't be mad at me.
I'm sorry for how I behaved.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.480
Have you been drinking again?

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.837
- Why are you being so hard on me? It's 4 p.m.
- Someone has to do it.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.872
When do you begin your great work
of art, Raphaella?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Never.

01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:40.117
"Never"? What? Why?

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.154
I'm a failure.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.233
Jo is in New York being
a writer, and I'm a failure.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.312
That's quite a statement
to make at 20.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.480
Rome took all the vanity out of me,
and Paris made me realize I'd never be a genius,

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.871
- so I'm giving up all my foolish artistic hopes.
- Why should you give up?

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.158
- You have so much talent and energy.
- Talent isn't genius.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.835
And no amount of
energy can make it so.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.071
I want to be great
or nothing.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.916
And I will not be some commonplace dauber,
and I don't intend to try anymore.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.189
Heh. What women are allowed
into the club of geniuses anyway?

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.796
The Brontës?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.075
Hmm.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.913
- That's it?
- Yes, I think so.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.674
And who always declares genius?

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.156
- Men, I suppose.
- They're cutting down the competition.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.120
Ha, ha. That's a very complicated argument
to make me feel better.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.759
Do you though?
Do you feel better?

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:40.911
- I do think, male or female, I am of middling talent.
- "Middling talent"?

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.512
Then may I ask
your last portrait be of me?

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.520
All right.

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:54.831
Now that you've given up
all your foolish artistic hopes...

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.840
Mm-hm?

01:04:55.841 --> 01:04:57.433
what are you gonna do
with your life?

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.594
Polish up all my other talents
and become an ornament to society.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.831
That's where Fred Vaughn
comes in, I suppose.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.600
- Don't make fun.
- I said his name.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.869
- You're not engaged, I hope.
- No.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:17.351
But you will be if he goes
down properly on one knee?

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.519
Most likely, yes.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.154
He's rich. Richer than you, even.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.960
I understand queens of society can't
get on without money,

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.590
although it does sound odd from the mouth
of one of your mother's girls.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.157
I've always known I would marry rich.
Why should I be ashamed of that?

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.233
It's nothing to be ashamed of,
as long as you love him.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.789
I believe we have some power
over who we love.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.111
It isn't something that
just happens to a person.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.590
I think the poets might disagree.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.512
Well, I'm not a poet.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.034
I'm just a woman.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.919
And as a woman, there's no way
for me to make my own money.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.872
Not enough to earn a living
or to support my family.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.156
If I had my own money,
which I don't,

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.312
that money would belong to my husband
the moment we got married.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:09.353
If we had children,
they would be his, not mine.

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.590
They would be his property.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.596
So don't sit there and tell me that marriage isn't
an economic proposition because it is.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.313
It may not be for you,
but it most certainly is for me.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.994
Oh, that's Fred.
Can you unbutton me, please?

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.110
Thank you.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.960
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:55.755
You look beautiful.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.676
You are beautiful.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:06.640
Hmm.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.592
Fred!

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.239
I've missed you.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.471
This is Fred Vaughn and his sister, Kate.
Course you know Mr. Brooke.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.791
This is Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo.

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.317
- So pleased to meet you.
- Oh, how elegant.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.713
I'm Amy March. You remember that name.
I'm gonna come find you one day in London.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.200
Oh, I certainly will.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.956
- Oh, that missed a boat.
- That's very kind.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.633
- Well...
- Sorry.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.359
I know something you don't know.

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:23.638
- Tell me this second.
- Has Meg perhaps mislaid a glove?

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.274
- Mr. Brooke has it!
- Yes.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:27.589
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.680
- Where?
- In his pocket.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.591
- All this time?
- Yes. Isn't it romantic?

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.990
- No, it's horrid.
- I thought you'd be pleased.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.520
At the idea of anybody coming
to take Meg away? No, thank you.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.832
Ah. You'll feel better when somebody comes
to take you away.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.834
- I'd like to see anyone try it.
- I would like to see someone try as well.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:51.269
<i>"We could never have
loved the earth so well</i>

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.399
<i>if we had had no childhood
in it,</i>

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.796
<i>if it were not the earth where the same
flowers come up again every spring</i>

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.475
<i>that we used to gather
with our tiny fingers.</i>

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.678
<i>What novelty is worth
that sweet monotony</i>

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.709
where everything is known
and loved

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.519
because it is known?"

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.200
How great is that?

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.600
Mm.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.319
I love to listen
to you read, Jo,

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:20.040
but I just love it better when you read
the stories you've written.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:22.278
I don't have any new stories.

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:23.359
Why not?

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:28.709
Haven't written any.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.352
You have a pencil and paper.
Sit here and write me something.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:36.470
I can't.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.032
I don't think I can anymore.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120
Why?

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:46.712
It's just... no one even cares
to hear my stories anyway.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.109
Write something for me.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.198
You are a writer.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.715
Even before anyone knew
or paid you.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.315
I'm very sick,
and you must do what I say.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.871
Do what Marmee taught us to do.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.474
Do it for someone else.

01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.754
If you're walking to Vermont,
there's a Mrs. Sewall in Keene, New Hampshire,

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.355
- who will give you room and board.
- There you are.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.116
You should go home.
I can take care of this.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:19.476
No, I need to be here.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.950
I've spent my whole life ashamed
of my country.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.112
No offense meant,
but you should still be ashamed.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.913
I know. I am.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.520
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, ma'am.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.080
Do you have sons in the Army?

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.193
Yes, ma'am. I had four.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.559
But two were killed,
and one is a prisoner.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.634
I'm going to the other, who's very sick
in a Washington hospital.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.349
You've done a great deal
for your country, sir.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:00.274
I'd go myself if I was any use,
but as I ain't, I give my boys.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.360
Sir, I'll get you a blanket...

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.878
to keep you warm.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.959
- Thank you. God bless.
- Bless you, sir.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.875
Mrs. March. Telegram
from Washington, ma'am.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.317
- Is Jo back yet from Aunt March?
- No, I haven't seen her yet.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.710
- I've got it!
- You want another pair of shoes?

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.793
Thank you.
I can't miss the last train.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.714
- Hannah, did you get Father's nightshirts?
- Yes, I did.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.519
What can I do to help,
Beth?

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.398
- Thank you for being here.
- Of course.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.958
- Did you find the warm blanket?
- If I may be of any more assistance, please tell me.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:48.576
- I'll look in on the girls every day without fail.
- Do we need more books or cloth?

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.600
Thank you.

01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:52.435
I've always admired your husband.
I pray for a quick recovery.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.920
I found these linens.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.435
- Hannah, medicine?
- The medicine is all packed.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.797
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I came to offer myself as escort to your mother.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.792
Mr. Laurence has commissions
in Washington,

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:05.038
and it would give me real satisfaction
to be of service to her there.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.395
Oh.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.233
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.079
All right, while I'm gone,
Hannah is in charge.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.949
Remember to check on the Hummels.
It will be a difficult winter for everyone.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.554
Will this be enough
for the train?

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.309
Twenty-five dollars? That's not like
Aunt March to be so generous.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.477
I didn't go to Aunt March.
I couldn't bear to.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.951
- Where'd you get the money?
- I only sold what was my own.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.350
Jo! Your hair!

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.477
- Your one beauty.
- You look like a boy.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.758
Well, it doesn't affect the fate
of the nation, so don't wail.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.270
Oh, I'm so proud you're my daughter.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.718
I was crazy to do something for Father.
It'll be good for my vanity anyway.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.553
- That could be nice.
- You never do that.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.677
- This isn't what I wanted for her.
- Oh, Teddy.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.560
Oh, Jo.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.474
My girls, I love you
more than words can say.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.718
Be good to each other.
Pray for Father's recovery.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.792
And I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880
Love you.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.796
Jo.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.555
What is it? Is it Father?

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640
No.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.798
It's my hair.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:27.480
I would feel the same way.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.960
I know you would.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.800
<i>Laurie, when are you
going back to your grandfather?</i>

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.469
Very soon.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.431
- You've said that a dozen times in the past month.
- Short answers save trouble.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.236
Well, he is expecting you,
so why don't you do it?

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:49.234
- Natural depravity, I suppose.
- Natural indolence, you mean.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.149
I'll only plague him if I go, so I might
as well stay and plague you a little longer.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.430
You can bear it.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.877
- In fact, I think it agrees with you.
- Stop it. Stop.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.870
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at you.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.799
I mean, what do you intend to do?

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:08.990
- With life?
- Yes.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.515
I've been writing an opera.
I would be the central figure.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600
That's a waste of time.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.953
What would you have me do?

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.838
Go work for your grandfather
and make something of yourself.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.435
You're not playing fair.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.200
Here.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.473
That's... That's very good.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.954
When did you do this one?

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.318
It was the day at the beach.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.512
First time I met Fred.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.795
That's right.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.796
What's he doing?

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.514
He's in London on business.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.954
He'll be back in a few weeks.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.750
Don't marry him.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
What?

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.476
Don't marry him.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:38.480
Why?

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:41.076
Why? You know why.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.240
No.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:47.640
No.

01:15:47.641 --> 01:15:49.633
- Yes.
- No. Laurie.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.200
- What?
- You're being mean.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.160
- Stop it. Stop it.
- What? How am I being mean?

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.795
I have been second to Jo
my whole life in everything.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:02.315
And I will not be the person you settle
for just because you cannot have her.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.073
I won't. I won't do it.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.111
I won't. Not when I've spent
my entire life loving you.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:28.878
I'm making a mold of my foot for Laurie,
to remind him I have nice feet.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.636
Mr. Brooke writes that Father
is still very weak but improving.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.034
Mr. Brooke also says that Mother is
the best nurse a man could ask for.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.794
I wish all the letters were
from Mother and not Mr. Brooke.

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.109
I'm grateful for any letters.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.880
I think the deep purple is
very fitting for Mr. Laurence.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.794
- Do you agree, Amy?
- Mm-hm. Quite. The design is very cunning.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.556
I had to thank him somehow for allowing me
to play the piano at his house all the time.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.960
I'm going into town for groceries.
Jo, can you look into getting more firewood?

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.157
You all haven't been
to the Hummels. We should go.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.956
Bethy, we barely have enough to feed ourselves.
Besides, I have to finish this story.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.200
- Marmee said...
- Marmee told us to do lots of things,

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.760
but we can't possibly do them all.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:07.480
I always go by myself. And you haven't
kept up with your tasks.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.718
- We do. We work.
- Don't worry. We'll find a time.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:11.800
But it's been weeks.

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:15.033
- We'll go soon.
- My foot is stuck! I can't get it out!

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:20.195
Stop it, Jo! I can't get it out!
I'm going to lose my foot. Ow.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.595
Fine. I'll go myself.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.516
Hello. For Mr. Laurence.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.680
Shh. Here she comes.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.559
Beth, look what they got you!

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.120
- Here's a letter from the old gentleman.
- Open the note.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.879
Oh, Beth, just look.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.676
Jo, read the letter. I cannot.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.835
"Miss Beth March, I have had
many pairs of slippers in my life,

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.277
but I never had any
that suited me so well as yours.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.159
And they will always remind me
of the gentle giver.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:19.631
I like to pay my debts
and hope you will accept this gift.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.077
Your grateful friend
and humble servant, James Laurence."

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.039
- Oh, Beth!
- So sweet. "Your humble servant."

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.191
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Look how shiny it is!

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:31.631
- Yes.
- It has gold that goes all the way around the back.

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.316
- His handwriting is beautiful.
- It's got a little drawer here.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.197
Sir, I wanted to thank you for...

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.034
You remind me...

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.157
so much of my little girl.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.314
The piano is yours.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.791
- I should have given it to you long ago.
- Thank you.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.795
My child...

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.873
you're burning.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.039
The Hummels are very sick.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.150
She's resting.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.392
- How is she? Is there anything I can do?
- What is it?

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.233
- Scarlet fever.
- What's scarlet fever?

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.880
I visited the Hummels.
The baby has died.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.679
Have you all had it before?

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.918
- Meg and I have, but Amy hasn't.
- Then she'll have to be sent away.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.229
I don't want to be sent away.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.789
- See if Aunt March can take her.
- I don't like Aunt March.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.634
- It's for your own good, child.
- Should we send for Mother?

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.475
- No, we shouldn't worry her.
- I've never wished for money more than now.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:04.679
Listen, we'll nurse her
and she'll get better.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:05.760
She will.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:11.909
"The post office in the forest was
a capital little institution

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.437
and flourished wonderfully,
for many things passed through it.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.230
Poetry and pickles,
music and gingerbread,

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.996
invitations, scoldings,
and even puppies."

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.797
- It's all about us.
- It is.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.357
- I love it.
- It's just a little story.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.160
- Nothing like what you usually write.
- You think it's too boring?

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.277
- No, it's my favorite one yet.
- Really?

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:36.794
- Write me another.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.200
- Keep writing them.
- I will.

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.714
Even when I'm not here.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.476
- Don't say that. Don't say it.
- Jo, I have to tell you.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560
No, you don't.

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.758
I've had a very long time
to think about this, and...

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.559
- And I'm not afraid.
- No.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.360
Nope.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.795
It's like the tide going out.
It goes out slowly, but it can't be stopped.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.680
I'll stop it.

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.359
I stopped it before.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.914
You will get better,
Father will get better,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.151
and we'll all be together soon,
all right?

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.440
We...

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:55.280
- We can't stop God's will.
- Well, God hasn't met my will yet.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.113
What Jo wills shall be done.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.349
Amy.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.635
Come here.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.400
Yes?

01:22:24.401 --> 01:22:25.471
Come, sit.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.315
If you are very good, one day,
this ring will belong to you.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.799
- Really?
- If you keep being a proper young lady,

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.234
just see if it doesn't.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.237
You are your family's hope now.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:55.393
Beth is sick, Jo is a lost cause,

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.793
and I hear Meg has had her head turned
by a penniless tutor, so...

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.075
it'll be up to you to support them all.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.080
And your indigent parents
in their old age.

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.279
So you must marry well.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.836
Hmm?

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.240
Save your family.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.918
All right, that's, uh...
That's all I wanted to say to you.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:29.790
So you can go back
and do your little painting.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.994
- Hello, Aunt March.
- Oh.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.715
That Laurence boy was just here.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:45.029
He was?

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.033
What a disappointment
he's turned out to be.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.839
Must be the Italian in him.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.031
Uh, when will he be back?

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.040
Hmm.

01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:54.555
He's gone.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.640
To London.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.600
Why?

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.276
What do you need to discuss
with him?

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.110
I... I just told Fred Vaughn
I wouldn't marry him.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.400
Meg.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.496
<i>I'll come home to help
with the children. Sorry.</i>

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:57.080
- I just... I'm so worried for Beth.
- Stay.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.471
- I asked for leave. I will take care of the children.
- Oh, John.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.436
There's one other thing.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.240
You should send your fabric
to the dressmaker as soon as possible.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.391
- I can't.
- I don't want to hear another word.

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.039
I want you to have that dress.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.476
My old coat will be fine
for the winter.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:14.800
- John, I...
- It's all settled.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.439
John, I really can't.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.152
I sold the fabric to Sallie.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360
You did?

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:27.031
I don't want you to be unhappy.

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.237
I couldn't be.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.916
John Brooke is my husband.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.480
And I am his wife.

01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.600
Hannah! It's all right.
It's all right.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.280
What do we do?

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.512
We should send for your mother.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.274
- Marmee!
- Bless you.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.397
She's worse. I didn't know
what else to do.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.512
- Jo, how is she?
- My girls.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.670
My sweet Beth.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:20.117
Hannah, make a clear broth.
Jo, get ice. We need to cool you.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.519
Who's with Father?

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.954
John stayed with him.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.872
We need to change the linens.

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.475
We're going to move you,
sweet girl.

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.760
- Oh, look at her.
- That's it.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.035
Hold on. It's okay.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:35.720
I know.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.955
Please fight.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.556
Don't go quietly.

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.640
Fight.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.192
Please, please, just fight
to the end and be loud,

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.715
and don't just quietly go away, Beth.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:07.920
Marmee?

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.080
Marmee?

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.840
Marmee?

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Jo.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.914
Merry Christmas, Beth.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.798
Popcorn. Make sure that it's
in the middle.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.576
- I know.
- You're doing the sides first,

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:36.230
and they aren't spaced for my popcorn
because I'm making a popcorn garland.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.640
And you're wasting decorations,
and they're not dangling right.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.792
The sides are the most important thing.
If you don't have the sides...

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:45.560
Here's another Christmas gift
for the March family.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.990
- Oh, my God! Father!
- Father!

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.480
Father!

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.480
My little women.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:58.874
How you've grown.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.435
Oh, Beth.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.952
Merry Christmas, my dear.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.033
- Merry Christmas to each of you.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.270
Merry Christmas.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.752
Oh, thank God.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.230
- Thank God you're home.
- Thank God for you.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.355
Now I can be angry with you
in person.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.629
I can't believe today
is my wedding day.

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.520
Mm.

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:33.440
What's wrong?

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.280
Nothing.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400
Jo.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.030
We can leave.
We can leave right now.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.237
I can make money. I'll sell stories.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:49.837
I'll do anything. I'll cook. I'll clean.
I'll work in a factory. I can make a life for us.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.991
- Jo...
- And you should be an actress,

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.072
and you should have
a life on the stage.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.799
Let's just run away together.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:58.440
- I want to get married.
- Oh, why?

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.034
Because I love him.

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.232
You will be bored of him
in two years,

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.232
and we'll be interesting forever.

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:08.990
Just because my dreams are different than yours
doesn't mean they're unimportant.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:12.589
I want a home.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.071
And a family. And I'm willing
to work and struggle.

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.629
But I want to do it with John.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.957
I just hate that you're leaving me.

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:29.756
Don't leave.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.910
Oh, Jo.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.719
I'm not leaving you.

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.874
And besides...

01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:42.232
one day, it will be your turn.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:52.080
I'd rather be a free spinster
and paddle my own canoe.

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.600
I would.

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.757
Can't believe childhood is over.

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.992
It was going to end one way
or another.

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.560
And what a happy end.

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:14.316
What excessive promises...

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:17.877
giving yourself away
to get the other.

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.519
What a gift.

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:24.880
Always given before is known
the cost or the reward.

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.679
I pronounce you man and wife.

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.320
You may kiss the bride.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.680
<i>Oh, don't have to make a fuss.</i>

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.871
You don't need to see me
to the carriage.

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.189
Oh, I'm happy to.

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.511
I hope you will be happy now...

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.670
that you've ruined your life the same way
your mother did by marrying your father.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.196
My dear sister,
you're too kind.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.318
- And thank you for today's festivities.
- You're most welcome.

01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.800
Thank you, Aunt March.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.237
Oh, I don't like to be kissed.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:32.073
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.995
You will be sorry when you've tried love
in a cottage and found it a failure.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:39.039
It can't be worse than
some people find in big houses.

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.352
Oh, I quite understand your meaning,
missus.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.959
I don't miss a thing.

01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.872
We know this.

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.953
And you're not entirely wrong.

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:53.391
I may not always be right,
but I'm never wrong.

01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:59.230
Ohh. And here is the only sane member
of the family.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.198
I really can't take
any more of this.

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.040
- I know.
- You can imagine.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:14.312
Marmee! Marmee!
Marmee, Marmee, Marmee!

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.392
- What?
- Aunt March is going to Europe.

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:18.273
Oh, and she wants me
to go with her!

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.520
That's wonderful!

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:23.354
Now I know why I spent
all those boring hours reading to her.

01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.954
No, no, she wants me to go.

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:28.392
As her companion.

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:30.358
Europe, with you?

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.638
Yes, she wants me to work on my art
and my French, of course.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.431
You don't really like
French though, do you?

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.554
That's wonderful, Amy.

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.350
Father! I'm going to Europe!

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:18.680
Meg married.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.911
Amy off to Europe.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.993
And now that you're a graduate,
you'll be off on a long holiday.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.038
I'm just not good like Beth,
so I'm angry and restless.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.794
You don't have to stay here, Jo.

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.190
Why? Should we run off
and join a pirate ship?

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.431
- No. No.
- It's no use, Jo.

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:43.800
- Don't.
- We got to have it out.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.950
- No.
- I have loved you

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.475
ever since I've known you, Jo.
I couldn't help it.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:49.950
- I tried to show and you wouldn't let me.
- No.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:54.472
But I must make you hear now and give me
an answer because I cannot go on like this!

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.119
- Please don't.
- I gave up billiards.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.476
I gave up everything you didn't like.
I'm happy I did.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.110
It's fine, and I waited,
and I never complained because I...

01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.836
You know, I figured
you'd love me, Jo.

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:08.997
And I realize I'm not
half good enough

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.231
- and I'm not this great man...
- No! Yes, you are.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.959
You're a great deal
too good for me.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.920
And I'm so grateful to you,
and I'm so proud of you, and I just...

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.118
I don't see why I can't love you
as you want me to.

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.395
I don't know why.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:23.350
You can't?

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.676
No. I can't.

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.911
I can't change how I feel, and...

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.400
it would be a lie to say
I do when I don't.

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:35.234
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:39.079
I'm so sorry,
but I just can't help it.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.595
I can't love anyone else, Jo.
I only love you.

01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.273
It would be a disaster
if we married.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.158
- It wouldn't be.
- We'd be miserable.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.232
- Jo, I'd be a perfect saint.
- I can't! I can't!

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.096
- I've tried it and I failed. I can't.
- Why does everyone expect it, then?

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:54.194
Why does your family and my grandpa expect it?
Why are you saying this? Say yes.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:59.236
- Let's be happy together, Jo!
- I can't say yes truly, so I'm not going to say it at all.

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.630
You'll see that I'm right eventually,

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.313
and you'll thank me for it.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:09.552
I'd rather hang myself
than realize this, Jo.

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.518
- Teddy.
- I would rather be dead.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.434
Teddy, don't say that.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:15.560
Teddy.

01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:21.234
Listen, you'll find some lovely,
accomplished girl

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.994
who will love you
and adore you,

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.756
and she's gonna make a fine mistress
for your fine house, but I wouldn't.

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.280
- Yes, you would, Jo.
- Look at me.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.319
- I'm homely, and I'm awkward, and I'm odd.
- I love you, Jo.

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:34.471
- And you'd be ashamed of me.
- I love you, Jo.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.359
And we would quarrel
because we can't help it even now.

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.751
I'd hate elegant society, you'd hate
my scribbling, and we would be unhappy.

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:47.753
And we'd wish we hadn't done it,
and everything will be horrid.

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.280
Is there anything more?

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.319
- No, nothing more.
- All right.

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.320
Except that...

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.155
Teddy, I don't believe
I will ever marry.

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:07.199
I'm happy as I am,

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.079
and I love my liberty too well
to be in any hurry to give it up.

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:11.594
- I think you're wrong, Jo.
- No.

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.434
I think you will marry.
I think you'll find someone and love them.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:17.558
And you will live and die for them
because that's your way, and you will.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.315
And I'll watch.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:03.393
I don't want to disturb your writing.

01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.874
I don't do that anymore.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.429
It didn't save her.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.357
You're much too lonely here, Jo.

01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.678
Wouldn't you like to go back to New York?
What about your friend Friedrich?

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.194
- Wasn't that his name?
- No.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.755
I ruined our friendship with my temper,
just as I ruin everything.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:43.274
I'm sure I'll never see him again.

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.194
I doubt that a sincere friend
would be deterred.

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:49.840
I wish that were true.

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:56.678
If I was a girl in a book,
this would all be so easy.

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.872
Just give up the world happily.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.793
Laurie's returning, you know.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.353
- Oh, he is?
- Mm.

01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:12.274
There was a letter from Amy.
She's coming home.

01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:15.239
She's devastated about Beth.

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.439
Aunt March is very ill,
so Laurie will accompany them.

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.432
- That's good of him.
- Mm.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.631
- What is it?
- I don't know.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:34.076
I've always been quite content
with my family.

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.354
Don't understand it.

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:42.637
Perhaps...

01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:45.189
Perhaps I...

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:47.590
was too quick in turning him down.

01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.840
Laurie.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.675
Do you love him?

01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.160
If he asked me again,
I think I would say yes.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.079
Do you think he'll ask me again?

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:05.640
But do you love him?

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.831
I care more to be loved.

01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:12.075
I want to be loved.

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.516
That is not the same as loving.

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:20.960
I know.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:26.672
You know, I just...
I just feel...

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.433
I just feel like...

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.678
women, they...

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.392
They have minds and they have souls,
as well as just hearts.

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:42.235
And they've got ambition and they've got talent,
as well as just beauty.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.520
And I'm so sick of people saying
that love is just all a woman is fit for.

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:49.120
I'm so sick of it.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.673
But I'm... I'm so lonely.

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:39.872
Couldn't let you travel alone
with Aunt March being so sick.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.313
Even if you despise me.

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.678
I don't despise you, Laurie.

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.078
Beth was the best of us.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.759
I'm not marrying Fred.

01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.119
I heard about that.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:20.991
And you are under no obligation
to say anything or do anything.

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.510
I just didn't love him as I should.

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:31.752
So we don't need to talk about it.
We don't need to say anything.

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.917
<i>My dear Teddy,</i>

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.196
<i>I miss you more than
I can express.</i>

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:56.271
<i>I used to think that
the worst fate was to be a wife.</i>

01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.512
<i>I was young and stupid.</i>

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.638
<i>But now I have changed.</i>

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:05.792
<i>The worst fate is to live
my life without you in it.</i>

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:10.437
<i>I was wrong to turn you down
and run away to New York.</i>

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.200
Oysters!

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.274
Lobsters!

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.710
<i>Jo.</i>

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.552
<i>Jo. Jo.</i>

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:43.040
Jo.

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.160
Wake up.

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:46.880
Wake up.

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.320
- Teddy! Oh, you're back.
- Are you glad to see me, then?

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.476
Yes.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.639
Oh, I was worried.

01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:01.358
Oh. Here, come sit.

01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:10.797
How's Amy? Did she bother you all the way
from Europe with her preening?

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:13.111
Yes, but I like that.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.714
Where is she?
Did she not come home?

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.360
Your mother has her down at Meg's.
We stopped on the way.

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.671
There was no getting my wife
out of their clutches.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.400
Your what?

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:27.309
I've done it now.
It was meant to be a surprise.

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.712
We were engaged
and we were hoping to wait,

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.918
but that is to say that
now we are man and wife.

01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.234
You and Amy?

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320
Yes.

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.314
Are you in love?

01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:52.400
Yes.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:58.496
Jo, I want to say one thing
and then we'll put it away forever.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:00.751
I've always loved you.

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:02.718
But the love I feel for Amy,
it's different.

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.200
And I think...

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.834
you were right about this.
I think we would've killed each other.

01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:11.676
Yes.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.913
I think it was meant this way.

01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:17.075
Oh, Teddy.

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:19.591
You're the only one that
ever calls me that, Jo.

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.680
"Teddy."

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:23.679
What does Amy call you?

01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:25.752
"My lord."

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.718
That sounds like her.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.717
Well, you look deserving of it.

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:38.995
Could we still be friends,
Jo, please?

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:44.914
Of course, my boy.
Always.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.115
She's a painter.

01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:59.440
Are you excited?

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Laurie told you?

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.514
Yes, yes.

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:16.032
Amy, I'm so happy for you.

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:18.318
This... This was meant to be.

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.392
Oh, I'm so relieved.
Thank you.

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:22.392
I wanted to write, Jo.
I wanted to write.

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:25.040
And I wanted to explain,
but everything was happening so fast

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:27.430
and I was worried you'd be angry at me.

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.234
- No. No.
- No, you're not angry at me?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.390
Life is too short to be angry
at one's sisters.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:41.880
I really miss her.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.320
I know.

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.080
Thank you.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.275
Mr. Laurence.

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.160
Jo.

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.595
Oh, Jo.

01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:00.919
I couldn't bring myself to...

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:08.956
The house doesn't seem right
without her, and...

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.349
Couldn't go in,
knowing she wouldn't be there.

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:23.190
I know I'm not half
so good as my sister,

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.231
but you know I'll be a friend
to lean on, if you'll let me.

01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.040
All right.

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:03.758
<i>Dear Mr. Dashwood,</i>

01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:08.232
enclosed are the first few chapters
of a piece I've only begun working on.

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.036
It could suit as a story for young people,
but I think it is probably quite boring.

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.198
<i>However, I'm sending it to you just in case
it has something of value, though I doubt it.</i>

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:18.475
<i>Jo March.</i>

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.553
I thought she hated me.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:42.030
She could still hate you
and leave you the house.

01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.918
What about you and John?

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.198
We can't manage a grand house
like this. It's too big.

01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:00.760
I should sell it, but I'd love to do something
that would really make Aunt March turn in her grave.

01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:02.832
- I wouldn't mind that.
- A nice turning.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:04.798
Just a rotation,
nothing terrible.

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:06.429
What will you do?

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.471
I'd like to open a school.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:13.598
We never had a proper school,
and now there are women's colleges opening.

01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.911
There should be a school. For Daisy.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.118
- And what will Demi do?
- I'll open a school for boys and girls both.

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:21.236
What about writing?

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:25.075
- What about it?
- What are you working on?

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.278
I started something,
but I don't think it's very good.

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:31.359
- Everyone likes what you write.
- No, they don't.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.920
I do.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.231
Well, it's just
about our little life.

01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:36.470
So?

01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:38.995
Well, who will be
interested in a story

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:40.958
of domestic struggles
and joys?

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:42.872
It doesn't have any
real importance.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.192
Maybe it doesn't seem important
because people don't write about them.

01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:49.956
No, writing doesn't confer importance.
It reflects it.

01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.038
I don't think so.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.191
Writing them will make them
more important.

01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.157
When did you become so wise?

01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:02.074
I always have been. You were just
too busy noticing my faults.

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:03.992
Which were never there,
of course.

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.954
<i>Dear Miss March,</i>

01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:26.717
I read the chapters you sent and I have
to agree, they aren't very promising.

01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:31.477
<i>But, please, send more stories
of the scandalous variety, if you have any.</i>

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:34.111
Or, shall I say, your friend can.

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.596
My apologies for the joke.

01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:38.716
I couldn't help it.

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.720
Jo, come down!

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:42.840
Coming!

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.920
I'm starving.

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.976
- Jo, you might wanna wait because...
- I'm famished.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.231
But, Jo, dear, you have a guest.

01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:55.953
I don't know anyone.

01:56:56.040 --> 01:56:58.680
I'm sorry to intrude, but...

01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.950
It's you.

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.115
Oh, uh... Heh.

01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:16.716
Hello.

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:19.597
Hello. I'm Josephine March.

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.393
- I'm Jo.
- Josephine, is that you?

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:25.110
Welcome! Welcome.
This is Kitty and Minnie.

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:30.634
And I see that you have already met our professor.
And he's a very accomplished man.

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:32.791
And your mother says
that you are a writer.

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.473
I keep a diary,
you know.

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:38.998
We have a lot of interesting people here,
intellectuals and Europeans...

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:42.551
Jo, I hope it is all right.
I got your address from Ms. Kirke.

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:44.233
Who's this?
Who are you?

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:48.758
I'm so sorry to intrude.
I was close by, and I thought I'd...

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:50.911
- But I'll be going.
- No, no.

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.872
Please stay.
We have more than enough room.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.593
Can someone tell me
who this man is?

01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:56.000
I don't want to be a burden.

01:57:56.080 --> 01:57:57.400
Oh, you're not a burden at all.

01:57:57.480 --> 01:57:59.176
- Yes, of course. Please.
- I'm Laurie.

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:01.396
- Who are you?
- I'm Friedrich Bhaer.

01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.995
We were at the same boardinghouse
together in New York.

01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.993
Oh, Jo, he's very handsome.

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:18.072
Do you intend to stay
in New York?

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.517
No. I've been offered
a professorship in California.

01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:26.480
And, as I have nothing
keeping me here,

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:29.075
I thought I might go west.

01:58:29.160 --> 01:58:32.915
It is new there, and they are
less particular about immigrants.

01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:35.432
Perhaps I should go west.

01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.957
You're not an immigrant,
so perhaps you should stay home.

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:43.874
I'm going!

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:53.956
Jo!

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.236
- Joseph, not Josephine.
- I know Joseph.

01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:57.674
Pretty well, actually.

01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:02.634
This is a beautiful instrument.

01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:04.120
Which one of you plays?

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.596
Oh, it was my sister Beth.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:08.717
We all play a little, but...

01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:10.519
But none so well as her.

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.717
It is very hard to lose
a sister.

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:14.836
I'm sorry.

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:19.634
- Do you play?
- Yes. I do.

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.315
It would make us so happy
if you'd play now.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.551
She wouldn't want the piano
to sit silent.

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.514
I don't wish to offend.

01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.193
Not in the least.

01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:00.157
- It was so lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you. Goodbye.

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:01.913
It was a real pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.719
- Bye, Laurie.
- Goodbye.

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.510
- Thank you for everything.
- Lovely to have you.

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:13.629
If you ever come to California,
I would love to see you.

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:18.035
I don't know that I will,
but thank you.

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.549
Well, goodbye.

02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:28.080
Goodbye.

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:43.680
What?

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:46.319
Why are you all looking
at me like that?

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:48.710
What a wonderful man.
I hope he comes back.

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:50.598
He would make a terrific friend
for me.

02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:53.189
- Oh, Father, he wasn't here for you!
- No?

02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:55.636
- Jo, you love him.
- What?!

02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:57.552
- No, no, I don't.
- Yes, you do!

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:01.520
I am half as smart as you, but I can see
it so plainly. You love him.

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.720
- Doesn't she love him?
- Good instinct. You love him.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:06.799
I have never seen you
so happy. What else is love?

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:10.351
You need to go after him. Laurie,
prepare the horses. We can catch him.

02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.352
- I'm coming too.
- No, I'm not going.

02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:14.796
- Yes, you are. Amy is right.
- Exactly!

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:18.317
Never thought I'd prepare a carriage
to help Jo March chase a man, but I like it.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:20.216
- He's moving to California.
- That was fiction!

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:23.711
- He was practically begging for a reason to stay.
- But it's raining outside.

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:25.712
That doesn't matter.
Can you come with me?

02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:27.320
- I need to fix you.
- Jo.

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:31.394
Laurie, will you stop standing there
and go get the horses ready? Thank you.

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:42.632
You never ask about my mother,
even when you know I've seen her.

02:01:42.720 --> 02:01:44.791
I assume she's still alive.

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.599
But I ask after your mother.

02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:48.717
And I have no idea why.

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:51.315
- You're willfully missing the point.
- That's true.

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:55.399
- What is that...? What do they want?
- I have no idea.

02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:58.656
- Father, are you publishing this?
- What happened to the "little women"?

02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:00.440
Tell me you have
the rest of this book.

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:02.440
What?

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.716
I'm just trying to fix this hair.

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:25.312
Ah! Stop, stop, stop.
Stop the carriage.

02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.960
- Wait, stop!
- Stop the carriage!

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.834
- Stop. All right, Go. Out. Out.
- Go. Go, go, go.

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:31.115
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.839
Kiss him with love!

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:45.550
Frankly, I don't see
why she didn't marry the neighbor.

02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:47.677
Well, because the neighbor marries
her sister.

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:51.880
Right, right.
Of course.

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:56.196
- So who does she marry?
- No one.

02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:58.119
She doesn't marry either of them.

02:02:59.160 --> 02:03:00.160
No.

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:04.359
No! No, no,
that won't work at all.

02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:06.336
She says the whole book that
she doesn't want to marry.

02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:08.033
Who cares?

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:12.040
- Girls want to see women married, not consistent.
- No, it isn't the right ending.

02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:14.316
The right ending is
the one that sells.

02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:16.520
Trust me.

02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:20.719
If you decide to end your delightful book
with your heroine a spinster,

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.473
no one will buy it.

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.392
It won't be worth printing.

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:29.560
I suppose marriage has always been
an economic proposition, even in fiction.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.070
It's romance.

02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:34.160
- It's mercenary.
- Just end it that way, will you?

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:36.280
Fine.

02:03:36.281 --> 02:03:37.555
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:39.353
- Kiss him with love!
- Go!

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:44.999
- You look so beautiful!
- Go, Jo!

02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:04.760
Jo!

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:15.354
I... I don't want you to leave.
I want you to stay.

02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:16.760
- You do?
- Yes.

02:04:16.840 --> 02:04:18.718
I would never leave
if you wish me to stay.

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:21.440
- No, I want you to stay.
- I have nothing to give you, Jo.

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.000
It doesn't matter.

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.480
My hands are empty.

02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:25.750
They're not empty.

02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:34.909
<i>I love it.</i>

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.639
<i>It's romantic.</i>

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:38.791
It's very moving.

02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:40.314
That's very emotional.

02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:43.154
- Well, thank you.
- We could call the chapter...

02:04:44.720 --> 02:04:46.313
"Under the Umbrella."

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.834
- That's good.
- Perfect.

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:50.116
- Now, there's the question of the contract.
- Mm-hm.

02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:52.510
I'm prepared to give you
5 percent of the royalties.

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:54.319
So I get 5 percent
of the profit.

02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:57.677
Five percent of the net profits,
after I recoup.

02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:00.475
Huh. Well, what about
a payment up front?

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.758
I'm the one taking the risk
in printing this book.

02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:05.559
Yes, but it's my book.

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:07.711
And if it does well, we'll both make money.

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:09.632
If not, I can stay in business.

02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:11.359
Oh, so I get nothing
if it fails.

02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:14.871
No, I'll give you $500 right now
to buy out the copyright.

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:16.360
The copyright?

02:05:16.361 --> 02:05:18.671
That's the right for reprinting,
that sort of thing.

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.752
Sequels, characters for other stories.

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:24.720
- Mm. Might that be worth something?
- Well, only if it's a success.

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:28.191
I see. It seems like something
I would want to own, no?

02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:31.159
Didn't you say your family needed
the money more immediately?

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:33.675
Yes, they do, which is
why I wanted up-front payment.

02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:37.515
No. It's too risky.
I'll only pay for the copyright.

02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.839
You keep your $500,
and I'll keep the copyright.

02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:52.075
Also, I want 10 percent
of royalties.

02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:57.596
Five point five percent.
That's very generous.

02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:00.354
- Nine percent.
- Six percent, and that's it.

02:06:02.200 --> 02:06:07.320
Mr. Dashwood, if I'm going to sell my heroine
into marriage for money, I might as well get some of it.

02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.119
Six point six percent.

02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:12.680
Done.

02:06:12.681 --> 02:06:15.275
And you don't need to decide
about the copyright right now.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.589
No, I've decided.

02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:18.399
I want to own my own book.

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:27.840
- Where is she?
- She's here, everyone!

02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:34.880
Come on!

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:46.034
Now, see if you can make a B.
