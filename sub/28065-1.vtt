00:51.937 --> 00:55.238
<i>Norway, 1987.</i>

00:55.240 --> 00:59.342
<i>A very wealthy and religious country
far up in the northern hemisphere.</i>

00:59.344 --> 01:02.745
<i>Look how much fun we have on the
streets of Oslo on a normal day.</i>

01:02.747 --> 01:04.916
<i>And that's our king
with his cool top hat.</i>

01:06.851 --> 01:09.852
<i>This is where I live with my
typical Norwegian family.</i>

01:09.854 --> 01:13.356
<i>That's my dad's Volvo
in the driveway.</i>

01:13.358 --> 01:18.965
<i>My home country... gray, boring, seal
clubbing, and a very high suicide rate.</i>

01:20.432 --> 01:22.532
<i>And that's me.</i>

01:22.534 --> 01:25.268
<i>An average teenager,
you may think,</i>

01:25.270 --> 01:27.270
<i>but you couldn't be more wrong.</i>

01:27.272 --> 01:30.173
<i>I am Oystein Aarseth,
A.K.A. Euronymous.</i>

01:30.175 --> 01:33.679
<i>I was brought to this world to
create suffering, chaos and death.</i>

01:35.113 --> 01:37.014
<i>This is my story.</i>

01:37.016 --> 01:38.617
<i>And it will end badly.</i>

01:39.417 --> 01:40.618
Cut him.

01:40.620 --> 01:42.352
- What?
- Cut him.

01:42.354 --> 01:44.356
Uh, but why?

01:45.290 --> 01:47.026
- Get off!
- You started this?

01:47.860 --> 01:49.192
- Do it!
- Get off!

01:49.194 --> 01:50.628
Fuck is wrong with you?

01:50.630 --> 01:52.029
What are
you guys doing up there?

01:52.031 --> 01:53.264
Such a dick!

01:58.336 --> 02:01.839
Four-string crush-fucker
Necrobutcher!

02:01.841 --> 02:08.244
And on drums, give it up for the
devil's favorite demon, Manheim!

02:08.246 --> 02:12.217
We are Mayhem!

02:35.174 --> 02:37.775
Mom, tell her
to get out of here!

02:37.777 --> 02:38.909
You guys suck.

02:38.911 --> 02:40.177
Get the fuck out of here.

02:40.179 --> 02:41.578
Get the fuck out of here.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.516
Go! Get out! Go!

02:44.084 --> 02:45.085
Again.

02:46.686 --> 02:48.585
<i>Life was so easy back then.</i>

02:48.587 --> 02:53.024
<i>It was all about having fun, getting
drunk, playing hard, and loud music.</i>

02:53.026 --> 02:54.258
- Hey, hey!
- Oh, fuck.

02:54.260 --> 02:56.529
We didn't give a shit
about anything else.

02:59.365 --> 03:01.632
- Hey! Stop!
- Run away, run away!

03:01.634 --> 03:03.233
Oh, shit.

03:03.235 --> 03:06.171
<i>When people told us what to do or
how to behave, we always said...</i>

03:06.173 --> 03:07.506
Fuck you!

03:09.508 --> 03:10.509
Come on.

03:17.017 --> 03:18.185
What do you think?

03:19.251 --> 03:20.684
Do I look evil?

03:20.686 --> 03:21.855
I like it.

03:22.756 --> 03:23.757
Really?

03:24.523 --> 03:26.292
- Promise?
- Promise.

03:27.694 --> 03:29.794
And what happens
if you break a promise?

03:29.796 --> 03:31.865
Satan comes after you.

03:36.636 --> 03:38.103
I am the beast!

03:38.105 --> 03:39.438
- I am the beast incarnate.
- Ahhh!

03:47.614 --> 03:48.782
Hey, guys,
this is Jorn.

03:50.117 --> 03:52.517
- You can call me Metalion.
- Let's do it.

03:52.519 --> 03:55.620
- Yeah, that's great.
- Come here.

03:55.622 --> 03:57.289
Yeah. Fuck, yeah!

03:58.125 --> 03:59.192
Get off of me.

04:04.364 --> 04:07.465
<i>We were world-famous
all over Oslo.</i>

04:07.467 --> 04:11.805
<i>We even had fans, real fucking
dedicated Mayhem fans.</i>

04:13.940 --> 04:16.107
<i>And then our idiot drummer
decided to leave the band.</i>

04:16.108 --> 04:17.875
Laters.

04:17.878 --> 04:22.781
<i>So we upgraded with this handsome
fellow, Jan Axel, A.K.A. Hellhammer.</i>

04:22.783 --> 04:24.417
One, two, three.

04:29.623 --> 04:36.095
<i>So now I got the best drummer in
Norway, a mad kick-ass bass player,</i>

04:36.097 --> 04:41.366
<i>and I came up with this new guitar sound
that would change the world forever.</i>

04:41.368 --> 04:46.040
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you Norwegian Black Metal!</i>

05:02.522 --> 05:05.456
<i>But we needed one more thing
to complete the band.</i>

05:05.458 --> 05:07.694
<i>A strong front man
and lead singer.</i>

05:09.696 --> 05:14.135
<i>We searched the world
and one day, we got a reply.</i>

05:16.536 --> 05:18.638
- What the hell is that stink?
- Fuck me.

05:20.340 --> 05:24.009
- Oh, fuck.
- What?

05:24.011 --> 05:27.345
Oh, fuck. HELLHAMMER:
Oh, fucking disgusting.

05:27.347 --> 05:29.584
Don't you fucking
puke in my dad's car.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.519
Watch out, man.

05:33.087 --> 05:34.354
Fuck.

05:35.790 --> 05:37.355
Shit, man.

05:37.357 --> 05:39.694
The tape, don't throw out
the fucking tape.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.272
This better be good.

05:56.177 --> 05:58.110
<i>Holy shit.</i>

05:58.112 --> 06:01.113
<i>We never heard anyone
sing like that.</i>

06:01.115 --> 06:04.752
<i>It was beautiful,
the perfect voice for Mayhem.</i>

06:06.355 --> 06:08.087
- Suck a dick!
- Die!

06:08.089 --> 06:11.025
Satan fucks children.

06:11.759 --> 06:14.627
<i>I had to get him.</i>

06:14.629 --> 06:19.698
<i>Turns out he wasn't from Transylvania at all,
but from Sweden, our next-door neighbor.</i>

06:19.700 --> 06:23.372
<i>He packed up all his shit and
headed to Norway to join my band.</i>

06:33.781 --> 06:35.583
- Shit.
- What?

06:36.684 --> 06:38.020
What the fuck?

06:43.926 --> 06:46.094
Hey, hey, hey, don't touch that.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.435
<i>His name was Pelle Ohlin...</i>

06:56.204 --> 06:57.304
Uh...

06:57.306 --> 06:59.374
<i>...but he called himself Dead.</i>

07:04.780 --> 07:05.781
All right.

07:07.648 --> 07:13.186
<i>And together, we moved into this luxurious
villa in the province of Kraktorp.</i>

07:13.188 --> 07:15.090
Pelle, you in there?

07:16.291 --> 07:18.024
Are we ready to rock?

07:18.026 --> 07:21.763
<i>We isolated ourselves and
focused on our dark, evil music.</i>

07:46.855 --> 07:50.292
<i>After a year together in the
house, we became close friends.</i>

07:53.028 --> 07:55.365
<i>He could not hide
his darkness and depression.</i>

07:57.532 --> 08:03.536
<i>As a child, he was bullied and beaten up
so bad, he actually died for a moment.</i>

08:03.538 --> 08:06.209
<i>That moment came to define
his whole existence.</i>

08:07.909 --> 08:10.279
<i>He devoted his life to death.</i>

08:12.681 --> 08:15.517
You know, there's a way out
if you're so fucking depressed.

08:19.688 --> 08:22.524
One shot to the head,
and it's all over, no more pain.

08:25.927 --> 08:27.863
Come on, fucker. Get up!

08:34.535 --> 08:36.304
<i>And he hated cats
more than anything.</i>

08:39.573 --> 08:41.344
Hey, there's a cat out there.

08:42.744 --> 08:44.412
- For real?
- Swear to God.

08:44.414 --> 08:46.881
- Let's blow the little fuck to pieces, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

08:46.883 --> 08:48.351
Ahhh!

08:50.019 --> 08:51.052
Where is it?

08:51.054 --> 08:52.453
- There he is.
- There we go.

08:52.455 --> 08:54.090
There it is, the little fucker.

08:57.293 --> 08:58.461
Still there?

09:10.940 --> 09:12.008
Do it.

09:13.376 --> 09:14.444
What?

09:15.011 --> 09:16.345
Pull the trigger.

09:18.515 --> 09:19.680
Fuck, do you mean it?

09:19.682 --> 09:20.850
You said it yourself.

09:22.185 --> 09:24.455
"One shot to the head,
and it's all over."

09:31.961 --> 09:33.096
Come on.

09:47.176 --> 09:48.778
Pull the fucking trigger!

09:58.522 --> 09:59.689
Ugh!

10:35.025 --> 10:37.792
Don't smile.
You'll fuck up the makeup.

10:37.794 --> 10:39.261
Sorry.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.696
This is not a joke.

10:42.199 --> 10:44.466
You are terror incarnate...

10:44.468 --> 10:46.034
Terror incarnate...
terror... Yeah.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.537
- Ruler of chaos and death!
- Yeah.

10:48.539 --> 10:51.039
And remember, you have
to get your poses right, too.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.507
Ahhh!

10:52.509 --> 10:56.711
Everyone around you are disgusting,
worthless little insects.

10:56.713 --> 10:59.247
We are the Lords of Chaos.

10:59.249 --> 11:01.018
Destroyer of worlds.

11:02.686 --> 11:03.687
No?

11:05.022 --> 11:07.189
One, two, three.

11:07.191 --> 11:08.356
Fuck!

11:13.797 --> 11:16.031
Hail Satan!

11:16.033 --> 11:17.801
Metalion, Jorn,
take our picture.

11:19.369 --> 11:20.469
Fuck, yeah.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.703
All right, what do you think?

11:21.705 --> 11:22.938
Yeah?

11:22.940 --> 11:25.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa/

11:25.275 --> 11:27.742
Fucking pumas incoming.

11:30.113 --> 11:31.281
Jorn.

11:32.950 --> 11:36.017
Ann-Marit, this is Oystein.

11:36.019 --> 11:39.022
- Euronymous.
- Sorry, um, Euronymous.

11:40.791 --> 11:42.425
Are you in the band
or something?

11:42.427 --> 11:45.093
- I'm the leader of the band.
- What band?

11:45.095 --> 11:46.195
Mayhem.

11:46.197 --> 11:47.798
Never heard of you guys.

11:48.633 --> 11:50.098
You will.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.436
You will!

11:54.372 --> 11:55.373
Okay.

11:56.441 --> 11:58.174
- Fuck, man!
- Sorry, man.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.510
I'm sorry.

12:38.783 --> 12:41.085
Die, motherfucker!

12:47.525 --> 12:49.794
I want to fucking die.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.252
What are you doing?

14:22.421 --> 14:24.356
This is, like,
way worse than...

14:36.969 --> 14:40.437
- What the fuck is that?
- It's my stage clothes.

14:40.439 --> 14:43.540
<i>Dead's raw talent,
dedication, and fucked-up brain</i>

14:43.542 --> 14:46.943
<i>became a big influence
on all of us.</i>

14:46.945 --> 14:50.180
<i>And it was time to introduce
the more evil-than-ever Mayhem</i>

14:50.182 --> 14:51.883
<i>to our local
black metalheads,</i>

14:51.885 --> 14:53.183
<i>and create some chaos.</i>

14:53.185 --> 14:54.752
What are you doing?
What's in the bag?

14:54.754 --> 14:56.754
Inhaling death.

14:56.756 --> 14:59.189
Oh, fucking disgusting!

14:59.191 --> 15:00.892
Argh, what the fuck?

15:00.894 --> 15:02.693
Fuck! What the fuck!
Is that real?

15:02.695 --> 15:03.960
That's it, yeah.

15:03.962 --> 15:05.964
- One more. Grab his hair.
- Ahhh!

15:07.534 --> 15:09.199
Alright,
let's go. Showtime.

15:09.201 --> 15:10.770
Let's go, go, go.

15:11.871 --> 15:13.272
Good luck, guys!

15:14.707 --> 15:17.375
What's up?

18:39.380 --> 18:40.414
How are you?

18:44.919 --> 18:47.420
You guys are the best metal band
in the world.

18:47.422 --> 18:48.921
- Yeah!
- Fuck yeah!

18:48.923 --> 18:52.358
Mmm. We're not just
a fucking metal band.

18:52.360 --> 18:56.929
I'm sick of all those speed and
death-metal bands, all that Swedish shit.

18:56.931 --> 19:00.066
All they do
is celebrate life and party.

19:00.068 --> 19:01.968
They should just
call it life metal.

19:03.705 --> 19:08.574
We play Black Metal, true
Norwegian Black Metal, and...

19:08.576 --> 19:10.945
Lokringer plate
ready for pickup.

19:15.116 --> 19:17.352
- Fuck off...
- You guys were very good.

19:18.253 --> 19:21.020
The gig is very good.

19:21.022 --> 19:23.022
My name is Kristian.
I'm from, uh...

19:23.024 --> 19:24.426
Oh, shit.

19:25.694 --> 19:27.262
I'm... I'm from Bergen.

19:32.434 --> 19:33.968
Scorpions?

21:31.188 --> 21:32.688
Drive carefully, darling.

22:34.417 --> 22:35.650
<i>You've reached
Hell House...</i>

22:35.652 --> 22:38.019
<i>The Prince of Darkness,
Euronymous and Dead the Corpse.</i>

22:38.021 --> 22:40.356
<i>Can't come to the phone right
now because we're too busy</i>

22:40.358 --> 22:42.957
<i>sacrificing little children
to Satan!</i>

22:42.959 --> 22:44.295
<i>Ha, ha, ha, ha!</i>

22:46.096 --> 22:47.697
<i>Hi, Pelle. It's Dad.</i>

22:50.533 --> 22:52.035
<i>I have some good news.</i>

22:53.803 --> 22:56.804
<i>We got the letter today, and
you got accepted to university.</i>

22:56.806 --> 22:58.806
<i>Congratulations!</i>

22:58.808 --> 23:02.380
<i>Also, we're going to the summer house,
and we would love it if you'd come.</i>

23:51.696 --> 23:55.132
Pelle, you lazy fuck!

23:56.634 --> 23:57.635
Fucker.

24:06.476 --> 24:07.611
All right.

24:10.381 --> 24:11.382
Oh, fuck.

24:14.285 --> 24:15.853
You jerking off again?

24:32.870 --> 24:35.039
Fuck. Why did...

24:35.474 --> 24:36.707
Fuck!

24:37.208 --> 24:38.642
How could he...

24:39.478 --> 24:40.644
We just...

24:42.947 --> 24:44.648
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

24:46.851 --> 24:49.754
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

26:24.616 --> 26:26.118
Pelle's not home.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.185
Back to Sweden?

26:29.187 --> 26:31.290
No, he blew his head off.

26:47.873 --> 26:48.874
Did you get them?

26:49.442 --> 26:50.775
I got them.

26:55.481 --> 26:56.482
Ooh.

26:58.717 --> 27:01.918
This is the one.
This is gonna make us famous.

27:01.920 --> 27:05.055
Mayhem will be the band with the
singer who blew his head off.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.857
Hey. We should say
I ate a piece of his brain, too.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.460
Yeah.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.197
I got something for you guys.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.430
This is good.

27:13.432 --> 27:17.370
Every member of Mayhem will wear
this at all times from now on.

27:20.772 --> 27:21.774
It's him.

27:22.707 --> 27:23.807
Cool.

27:23.809 --> 27:26.212
- What do you mean, "It's him?"
- It's him...

27:26.979 --> 27:27.980
Dead.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.216
Oh, what the fuck?

27:32.218 --> 27:34.185
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck am I doing?

27:34.187 --> 27:37.521
No fucking way am I wearing that shit.
It's sick!

27:37.523 --> 27:40.293
He was our friend,
and now he's fucking dead.

27:42.528 --> 27:46.030
I don't have any friends,
nor should you.

27:46.032 --> 27:49.466
- This is so fucking wrong.
- It's supposed to be wrong.

27:49.468 --> 27:50.935
People are supposed
to hate what we do.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.937
People are supposed to think
we're fucked in the head.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.473
Well, you fucking are.

27:56.543 --> 27:58.612
You do as I say,
or you're out of my band.

28:01.214 --> 28:03.115
- It's your band?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.455
You're fired.
Get the fuck out of my face.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.628
You've gone too far.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.531
Shit, man.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.600
Jorn, come back.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.301
- He's coming back, right?
- No.

28:23.303 --> 28:25.270
No. He's replaceable.

28:25.272 --> 28:26.607
He's replaceable!

28:41.053 --> 28:44.021
<i>I had to get out
of that fucking house.</i>

28:44.023 --> 28:45.692
<i>I couldn't deal with it.</i>

28:47.361 --> 28:49.860
<i>It was time to move into
the next chapter of my story</i>

28:49.862 --> 28:51.598
<i>and fulfill one of my dreams.</i>

28:55.035 --> 28:57.369
Ahhh!

28:57.371 --> 28:59.870
<i>So with a little help
from my friendly father,</i>

28:59.872 --> 29:03.608
<i>I opened my record store,
Helvete, Norwegian for "Hell."</i>

29:03.610 --> 29:05.212
Welcome.

29:11.451 --> 29:14.019
<i>I wanted to create a place
for me and my people,</i>

29:14.021 --> 29:17.524
<i>a temple for evil, chaos,
and black metal.</i>

29:22.963 --> 29:24.865
I like your new place,
Euronymous.

29:25.799 --> 29:28.703
I've been planning this
for years.

29:43.718 --> 29:48.388
This place is for us and us
only, the Inner Circle,

29:49.256 --> 29:50.424
the Black Circle.

29:52.092 --> 29:54.361
<i>I was building my own empire.</i>

29:55.763 --> 29:58.932
<i>Everything that happened
made me immune to reality.</i>

30:00.368 --> 30:02.704
<i>I had no more limitations.</i>

30:04.806 --> 30:06.940
<i>I could do whatever
the fuck I wanted.</i>

30:08.108 --> 30:09.711
<i>Nothing could stop me.</i>

31:01.864 --> 31:03.598
Why do you sell this shit?

31:05.133 --> 31:07.201
I thought this place
was true metal.

31:08.035 --> 31:09.368
It is.

31:09.370 --> 31:12.938
I got music you can't find
anywhere else in the world,

31:12.940 --> 31:14.475
just not on display for posers.

31:15.711 --> 31:16.978
So where is it?

31:17.813 --> 31:19.882
If you know it, you'll find it,

31:20.548 --> 31:22.718
but a poser won't find shit.

31:47.443 --> 31:49.778
- You wanna buy it or listen to it?
- Both.

31:55.317 --> 31:58.217
I released that on my
record label,

31:58.219 --> 32:00.687
Deathlike Silence.

32:00.689 --> 32:01.790
Beer!

32:13.802 --> 32:15.270
No thanks, I don't drink.

32:16.705 --> 32:17.972
You want a glass of milk?

32:19.808 --> 32:21.040
What's your name?

32:21.042 --> 32:23.378
Oh, it's, uh,
it's Kristian, right?

32:24.546 --> 32:27.247
Are you a...
Are you a Christian, Kristian?

32:27.249 --> 32:28.484
Not anymore.

32:31.119 --> 32:32.552
Not anymore?

32:32.554 --> 32:33.787
So what are you now?

32:33.789 --> 32:37.292
I mean, I've changed
my name to Varg.

32:37.860 --> 32:39.428
Mmm, Varg.

32:40.395 --> 32:41.597
I like Varg.

32:45.033 --> 32:46.201
"Not anymore."

32:49.939 --> 32:51.106
Fucking poser.

32:58.815 --> 33:00.113
Want some?

33:00.115 --> 33:02.217
Oh, no. I...
I don't eat meat.

33:02.886 --> 33:04.453
- No?
- No.

33:05.654 --> 33:08.624
- Like Hitler?
- Yeah, exactly like Hitler.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.929
Sorry about your singer.

33:16.465 --> 33:21.535
So you've got, um, your own
band, your own record shop,

33:21.537 --> 33:22.539
and your own label.

33:25.708 --> 33:29.544
Mmm. Each of these red dots is a
pen pal who sends me demo tapes,

33:29.546 --> 33:31.378
and I sent a few in return...

33:31.380 --> 33:34.549
South America, Central America,
Poland, Romania.

33:34.551 --> 33:37.620
Countries all over the world
make dark, evil music.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.489
You know why?

33:39.856 --> 33:40.857
No.

33:41.691 --> 33:43.691
Things are miserable.

33:43.693 --> 33:45.461
People are ruled
by dictatorship.

33:47.195 --> 33:48.531
Just like us here in Norway.

33:49.131 --> 33:50.265
Like us?

33:51.935 --> 33:53.467
In... In Norway?

33:53.469 --> 33:54.537
Yes.

33:55.271 --> 33:57.137
The fucking church,

33:57.139 --> 34:00.908
they're oppressing us with their
kindness and their goodness,

34:00.910 --> 34:05.379
brainwashing an entire population with
fake empathy and fucked-up solidarity.

34:05.381 --> 34:07.317
Hate them and their churches.

34:08.551 --> 34:10.119
We should burn them down.

34:13.755 --> 34:15.024
You get it, right?

34:16.793 --> 34:18.426
I mean, you're...
You're a Satanist, right?

34:18.428 --> 34:19.429
Yeah!

34:26.436 --> 34:28.638
- Fuck!
- Ahhh!

34:41.818 --> 34:43.217
Got something for your label.

34:43.219 --> 34:45.388
Ahhh!

34:46.623 --> 34:47.856
Burzum?

34:47.858 --> 34:49.190
Who else is in the band?

34:49.192 --> 34:52.029
No, it's... It's me.
It's just me.

34:52.862 --> 34:55.362
Varg, the lone wolf.

34:55.364 --> 34:56.867
- Hail Satan!
- I like it.

35:05.743 --> 35:07.541
Hail Satan!

35:07.543 --> 35:09.978
Ahhh!

35:31.367 --> 35:32.369
Ooh!

35:34.371 --> 35:35.539
<i>Party's over.</i>

35:48.052 --> 35:50.552
<i>Argh!</i>

35:50.554 --> 35:51.555
Ah.

36:22.053 --> 36:24.386
<i>I was stunned.</i>

36:24.388 --> 36:27.689
<i>Just like the first time
I heard Pelle's voice.</i>

36:27.691 --> 36:30.692
<i>Where the hell
did this poser come from,</i>

36:30.694 --> 36:32.796
<i>and how can he be
so fucking perfect?</i>

36:34.199 --> 36:37.599
<i>This was exactly the kind
of shit I needed for my label.</i>

36:37.601 --> 36:39.769
<i>It was true
Norwegian Black Metal.</i>

36:39.771 --> 36:41.369
Holy shit.

36:41.371 --> 36:43.773
Faust, you have
to listen to this.

36:43.775 --> 36:46.541
It's a fucking masterpiece.

36:46.543 --> 36:48.610
<i>I had to talk
to this fucking poser.</i>

37:00.191 --> 37:02.592
Seriously evil music, man.

37:02.594 --> 37:04.861
It's perfect for my label.

37:04.863 --> 37:07.866
Only one fucking problem,
I'm broke.

37:08.967 --> 37:10.700
- Good luck.
- Hey, wait.

37:10.702 --> 37:12.034
Wait, I can get the money.

37:12.036 --> 37:14.539
Just please, please shut up.

37:17.442 --> 37:19.307
So what, you're rich?

37:19.309 --> 37:20.779
My mother will pay.

37:24.149 --> 37:27.617
<i>So, the poser's
mother actually paid.</i>

37:27.619 --> 37:32.221
<i>We joined forces, and together we recorded
Burzum's first ever studio recording</i>

37:32.223 --> 37:34.857
<i>at the legendary
Grieghallen Studios.</i>

37:34.859 --> 37:36.192
How you feeling?

37:36.194 --> 37:38.561
- I'm feeling great.
- Yeah.

37:38.563 --> 37:41.099
Satan!

37:43.935 --> 37:48.404
Oh, I'm gonna fuck that one. I'm gonna fuck her so good.

37:48.406 --> 37:51.808
I want one microphone in the
center of the room, nothing else.

37:51.810 --> 37:53.044
That's gonna sound horrible.

37:55.313 --> 37:56.548
That's the whole point.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.714
All right.

37:58.716 --> 38:02.885
<i>He had some really bad ideas,
but with a little help from me,</i>

38:02.887 --> 38:08.160
<i>the end result was True Metal, metal enough
for him to become part of the Black Circle.</i>

38:12.198 --> 38:14.099
You know that drummer
I was talking about?

38:14.967 --> 38:16.268
Bad hygiene...

38:26.611 --> 38:28.379
Hey, whatever happened
to the drummer of...

38:30.883 --> 38:32.383
It's hilarious.

38:35.054 --> 38:37.154
Our next album is almost done,

38:37.156 --> 38:39.124
the most evil music
you've ever heard.

38:39.892 --> 38:41.390
It's my band.

38:41.392 --> 38:43.026
It's coming out on my label.

38:43.028 --> 38:44.196
Cool.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.030
So are you planning any gigs?

38:47.032 --> 38:48.598
Of course not.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.434
Concerts are for those
Swedish life metal bands.

38:51.436 --> 38:54.104
Exactly. Posers claiming
to be Satanists

38:54.106 --> 38:57.373
when all they want to do is
drink beer and have a good time.

38:57.375 --> 39:02.613
I hate that, all those death metal kids
with their stupid Morbid Angel t-shirts.

39:02.615 --> 39:05.649
They're making a trend out of something
that was meant to instill fear.

39:05.651 --> 39:08.888
We should put them in the showers
and, uh, gas them to death.

39:22.134 --> 39:23.533
Gas them to death?

39:23.535 --> 39:24.536
Oh!

39:27.539 --> 39:28.805
Oh!

39:28.807 --> 39:30.308
Ahhh!

39:30.310 --> 39:31.475
Fuck off!

39:31.477 --> 39:33.211
You're so
fucking drunk, mate.

39:33.213 --> 39:35.147
Hail Satan!

39:35.814 --> 39:37.714
You should take my picture.

39:37.716 --> 39:38.815
Maybe.

39:38.817 --> 39:40.651
- You should.
- I don't know.

39:40.653 --> 39:43.053
Faust, do it! Do it!

39:43.055 --> 39:44.788
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39:44.790 --> 39:46.391
Okay, okay, okay!
That's enough. That's enough.

39:46.393 --> 39:47.524
- Let's go.
- All right. All right.

39:47.526 --> 39:49.294
Go, go, go. Go!

39:49.296 --> 39:50.462
Whoo!

40:01.540 --> 40:04.476
So is this where you take
all your groupies?

40:05.378 --> 40:07.145
We don't have
any fucking groupies.

40:07.147 --> 40:08.779
You wouldn't know what
to do with them anyways.

40:08.781 --> 40:11.117
We don't want
any fucking groupies.

40:13.153 --> 40:15.752
We're into destruction
and suffering.

40:15.754 --> 40:18.325
When people hear our music,
we want them to commit suicide.

40:21.694 --> 40:23.296
You think we're
just saying this?

40:24.463 --> 40:27.131
I think it's all just
some stupid image.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.033
Well, that's bullshit.
We're for real.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.969
Well, I don't know.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.872
Seems like you just
copied Venom to me.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.474
You know all that Satanist talk
was just an image, right?

40:37.476 --> 40:39.045
- Says who?
- Venom.

40:41.781 --> 40:43.616
When they say
it was just an image,

40:45.051 --> 40:47.719
that's just part of their image.

40:47.721 --> 40:49.721
So when are you
gonna take my picture?

40:49.723 --> 40:50.888
I never said I would.

40:50.890 --> 40:52.323
Why don't we go upstairs
and talk about it?

40:52.325 --> 40:53.626
Why don't we all stay?

40:56.696 --> 40:57.964
Take off your clothes.

41:12.045 --> 41:13.314
Are you fuckin' deaf?

41:16.549 --> 41:19.152
I said take off
your clothes. Now.

41:51.385 --> 41:53.720
<i>Argh!</i>

41:58.292 --> 42:00.294
Turn the fucking volume down.

42:07.201 --> 42:11.138
I wonder what it feels like to
penetrate a knife into a human body.

42:12.306 --> 42:13.972
You should find out.

42:13.974 --> 42:16.043
Yeah, maybe I should.

42:17.445 --> 42:19.880
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> gentlemen.
Please come again.

42:20.881 --> 42:21.982
Thank you.

42:25.886 --> 42:28.720
Is this, uh, Deathlike Silence?

42:28.722 --> 42:30.891
Deathlike Silence!
Yeah, that's us.

42:32.726 --> 42:33.792
Thank you, Mr. Postman.

42:33.794 --> 42:35.329
It's your fucking record.

42:43.037 --> 42:44.603
Fucking great.

42:44.605 --> 42:45.806
Oh, shit!

42:49.210 --> 42:50.642
And they printed it wrong.

42:50.644 --> 42:52.377
It should be
"Spell of Destruction"

42:52.379 --> 42:54.414
not "Black Spell
of Destruction."

42:54.416 --> 42:55.450
No, I changed it.

42:57.785 --> 42:59.220
Why would you do that?

43:00.654 --> 43:02.390
'Cause it's better with "Black."

43:12.300 --> 43:13.701
When will I get paid?

43:15.403 --> 43:19.638
First we sell some,
then you get paid some.

43:19.640 --> 43:22.710
We have to let people know the
album is out, get some attention.

43:23.478 --> 43:25.711
You have any ideas?

43:25.713 --> 43:28.314
Thought you were the marketing genius,
but I guess I could have some...

43:28.316 --> 43:29.551
Please feel free.

43:30.818 --> 43:31.952
Good luck.

44:55.303 --> 44:56.704
Hey, man, turn it up.

44:56.706 --> 44:59.475
- What?
- The fuckin' TV, turn it up.

45:01.209 --> 45:02.710
<i>...same church in Bergen.</i>

45:02.712 --> 45:05.778
<i>Local police suspect
the fire was deliberate.</i>

45:05.780 --> 45:08.781
<i>No suspects so far.</i>

45:08.783 --> 45:10.484
- He did it!
- Who did?

45:10.486 --> 45:13.454
- What?
- Varg, the church, he did this.

45:13.456 --> 45:15.054
That's awesome.

45:15.056 --> 45:16.390
- Fuck.
- That's cool.

45:16.392 --> 45:19.892
I said we needed promotion,
and he fucking did it...

45:19.894 --> 45:22.795
- Holy sh...
- ...and I told him to do it.

45:22.797 --> 45:24.764
- Fuck, this is so cool.
- I told him to do it.

45:24.766 --> 45:27.034
- Fuck.
- It's on the fucking news.

45:27.036 --> 45:29.536
Holy fuck!

45:29.538 --> 45:35.309
<i>Police are still looking for the suspect
responsible for the Fantoft Church burning.</i>

45:35.311 --> 45:37.544
- The church had been built in...
- Holy shit.

45:37.546 --> 45:39.713
Dude,
Varg is a fucking hero.

45:39.715 --> 45:40.716
Fuck!

45:42.885 --> 45:44.887
Fucking fuck.

45:45.621 --> 45:46.722
<i>He did it.</i>

45:47.990 --> 45:50.826
<i>And he made us all
look like fucking Boy Scouts.</i>

45:51.793 --> 45:52.895
<i>Shit...</i>

45:54.463 --> 45:56.032
<i>He fucking did it.</i>

46:18.287 --> 46:19.388
He's here now.

46:20.823 --> 46:22.058
Hey, turn it off.

46:25.227 --> 46:26.896
What you did was fucking cool.

46:29.198 --> 46:31.033
I've been talking
about it for years.

46:32.301 --> 46:33.804
I'm glad you got inspired.

46:34.805 --> 46:35.806
Inspired?

46:36.707 --> 46:38.038
We finally did it.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.042
- We did it?
- Yeah, that's right.

46:41.378 --> 46:44.878
Now, think of all the people
who are so sad and broken up

46:44.880 --> 46:48.783
about what happened to their dear,
holy, ancient fucking church.

46:58.562 --> 47:00.497
Hail Satan, my lord!

47:05.202 --> 47:08.538
Laugh now,
you fake fucking Nazi.

47:12.376 --> 47:17.147
<i>After the Fantoft Church burning,
everything became a fucking competition.</i>

47:18.715 --> 47:21.818
<i>Whatever I did, Varg did
10 times bigger and better.</i>

47:26.957 --> 47:29.126
<i>His creativity was exploding.</i>

47:30.260 --> 47:32.293
<i>He fucked anything
that moved.</i>

47:32.295 --> 47:36.900
<i>He added another stupid name to his
list of names... Greifi Grishnackh.</i>

47:39.469 --> 47:41.536
<i>The girls lined up for fucking.</i>

47:41.538 --> 47:44.072
- Is Greifi here?
- No, he's not fucking here.

47:44.074 --> 47:45.240
Get out.

47:45.242 --> 47:47.208
<i>The world I built
was about to fall apart.</i>

47:47.210 --> 47:49.379
<i>And how many fucking girls
can one fuck?</i>

48:01.158 --> 48:03.393
<i>There were churches
burning all over.</i>

48:04.995 --> 48:07.929
<i>My future and success
disappeared behind his actions.</i>

48:07.931 --> 48:08.965
Fuck!

48:11.201 --> 48:12.804
<i>I had to do something about it.</i>

48:14.471 --> 48:16.139
I hereby appoint you

48:18.041 --> 48:19.544
bass player of Mayhem.

48:24.981 --> 48:26.283
It's an honor.

48:28.553 --> 48:29.953
Congratulations, man.

48:37.895 --> 48:41.799
Oystein, we should
burn one down together.

48:44.302 --> 48:46.535
- I don't know, Kristian.
- Call me Varg.

48:46.537 --> 48:49.705
Yeah, I'm going to...
I'm out of here.

48:49.707 --> 48:51.107
I'll see you guys later.

48:54.712 --> 48:55.977
You've already done it.

48:55.979 --> 48:59.381
Yes, but you said it yourself...

48:59.383 --> 49:01.051
"We should burn them all down."

49:17.368 --> 49:18.436
Hey, wait.

49:23.774 --> 49:24.876
For what?

49:31.549 --> 49:33.551
You know what was here,

49:35.152 --> 49:39.557
this very piece of land, before the
Christians came and raped this country?

49:41.827 --> 49:44.794
Sacrificial altar to Odin.

49:44.796 --> 49:47.731
The Christians built
this disgusting church

49:47.733 --> 49:50.067
right on our ancestors'
holiest site.

49:51.135 --> 49:53.037
Fucking disrespectful, isn't it?

49:55.373 --> 49:56.940
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

49:56.942 --> 49:57.943
Ah!

49:59.043 --> 50:01.379
- Wait. Is that a fucking...
- Yes.

50:03.549 --> 50:04.814
Wait. Are...
You're just going to...

50:04.816 --> 50:07.218
I'm going to leave it there
and it's going to explode.

50:22.199 --> 50:27.537
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

50:27.539 --> 50:29.873
Six, six...

50:29.875 --> 50:32.444
Three, two, one.

50:37.749 --> 50:38.784
Fuck.

50:40.652 --> 50:42.986
Uh, uh, Kristian...

50:42.988 --> 50:45.055
I mean, Varg!

50:45.057 --> 50:47.057
I mean, Greifi, seriously, man.

50:47.059 --> 50:48.460
Could be a dud.

51:20.059 --> 51:22.893
Yeah, you burn
that fucking Bible.

51:22.895 --> 51:24.831
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

51:26.732 --> 51:30.034
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

51:30.036 --> 51:31.635
- Whoa!
- Go, go.

51:37.209 --> 51:38.377
Okay.

51:57.429 --> 51:59.464
You're a fucking maniac.

52:00.133 --> 52:01.901
Am I evil?

52:02.367 --> 52:04.302
Yes, I am!

52:05.370 --> 52:07.540
Burn, motherfucker!

52:24.891 --> 52:26.323
Okay, all right, let's go.

52:26.325 --> 52:27.326
Let's go.

52:55.221 --> 52:57.888
<i>Church
burnings all over the country.</i>

52:57.890 --> 53:01.059
<i>Can you tell us what happened
here at Revheim last night?</i>

53:01.061 --> 53:05.396
<i>The only thing we know is that the fire
started around 5:00 a.m. in the morning,</i>

53:05.398 --> 53:07.165
<i>and it could all be very...</i>

53:07.167 --> 53:09.502
Come on, boys.
Dinner's ready.

53:11.270 --> 53:14.041
It's your favorite.
Spaghetti bolognese.

53:18.377 --> 53:21.479
Honey, have
you seen the news? It's insane.

53:21.481 --> 53:25.718
<i>There are clear tracks of evidence of
Satanic activity at the Revheim Church.</i>

53:36.496 --> 53:38.163
Mom, I'm going out.

53:38.165 --> 53:39.499
Okay, honey.

55:07.055 --> 55:08.388
I'm right here.

55:09.891 --> 55:11.391
You don't have to be afraid.

55:16.630 --> 55:18.398
We can do whatever you want.

55:24.706 --> 55:26.307
I was exactly like you.

55:26.975 --> 55:27.976
Okay.

55:29.310 --> 55:30.645
I used to go around

55:31.980 --> 55:33.214
carrying all those...

55:34.883 --> 55:35.984
Not here.

56:13.554 --> 56:14.789
Argh!

57:14.416 --> 57:15.451
Argh!

58:56.052 --> 58:59.454
- When will I get paid?
- Anytime now.

58:59.456 --> 59:02.058
I need it.
I have to pay back my mom.

59:03.293 --> 59:05.161
Uh, she'll get her money soon.

59:11.901 --> 59:13.901
I thought we sold a lot.

59:13.903 --> 59:16.804
Well, first we need to recoup
everything, then you'll get paid.

59:16.806 --> 59:18.374
Studio was expensive.

59:26.883 --> 59:28.316
- I did it.
- <i>Earlier today,</i>

59:28.318 --> 59:31.553
<i>a jogger discovered the
body of a 43-year-old man</i>

59:31.555 --> 59:33.123
<i>who was stabbed to death.</i>

59:35.391 --> 59:36.960
That, that was you?

59:38.228 --> 59:39.428
Yeah.

59:39.430 --> 59:40.897
<i>And extremely violent.</i>

59:41.898 --> 59:43.066
What...

59:44.234 --> 59:45.400
When?

59:45.402 --> 59:46.736
Last night.

59:49.473 --> 59:50.707
That was...

59:54.311 --> 59:56.644
That was a really
smart fucking move, man.

59:56.646 --> 59:58.215
Congratulations.

01:00:00.551 --> 01:00:02.650
You'll be the new hero
of the Black Circle.

01:00:02.652 --> 01:00:04.386
We should celebrate.

01:00:04.388 --> 01:00:06.557
Let's burn down
a fucking church, huh?

01:00:09.293 --> 01:00:10.960
Yeah. Yeah, let's fuckin' do it.

01:00:32.882 --> 01:00:34.051
- All right.
- All right.

01:00:38.821 --> 01:00:39.957
Here you go.

01:00:44.295 --> 01:00:45.329
Yeah!

01:00:58.309 --> 01:01:00.876
Hey, come on.
Don't just stand there.

01:01:00.878 --> 01:01:03.147
You're the master
of this shit, right?

01:01:08.719 --> 01:01:10.054
Fuck this shit.

01:01:11.388 --> 01:01:13.055
That's right.

01:01:13.057 --> 01:01:14.959
Let's get you good and white.

01:01:20.898 --> 01:01:21.966
Faust,

01:01:24.134 --> 01:01:25.236
you do the honors.

01:01:43.988 --> 01:01:46.888
For Jesus and his disciples.

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:47.891
Let's go.

01:01:56.301 --> 01:01:57.335
Whoo!

01:01:59.069 --> 01:02:01.172
Burn the fucking thing down!

01:02:02.873 --> 01:02:05.377
- Whoa!
- Fucking piece of shit.

01:02:06.478 --> 01:02:08.647
Whoo! Yeah!

01:02:11.383 --> 01:02:13.618
Whoo!

01:02:24.629 --> 01:02:26.396
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Let's go!

01:02:26.398 --> 01:02:27.399
Let's go!

01:03:14.814 --> 01:03:16.214
Dude, I'm so fucking drunk.

01:03:23.389 --> 01:03:24.989
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:03:25.491 --> 01:03:27.324
Nice armor.

01:03:27.326 --> 01:03:29.660
- Congrats on the fire, guys.
- Yeah, congrats.

01:03:29.662 --> 01:03:32.161
Something else
you guys should know.

01:03:32.163 --> 01:03:33.733
This must stay
within the circle.

01:03:37.168 --> 01:03:38.637
Faust killed someone.

01:03:42.408 --> 01:03:43.908
Stabbed a human to death.

01:03:45.877 --> 01:03:49.279
Yeah, we talked about what it would
feel like to put a knife in a body.

01:03:49.281 --> 01:03:50.716
- We did?
- Yes.

01:03:51.817 --> 01:03:53.319
I said, "What the fuck?

01:03:53.885 --> 01:03:55.154
"You should try it."

01:03:56.955 --> 01:03:58.557
And he followed my advice.

01:04:00.126 --> 01:04:02.393
So from now on,
we have to lay low.

01:04:02.395 --> 01:04:04.294
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure.

01:04:04.296 --> 01:04:06.232
- Yeah.
- Why would we do that?

01:04:08.234 --> 01:04:10.636
Oh, you know, we've taken it
to a whole new level.

01:04:12.004 --> 01:04:13.239
In what way?

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.474
Homicide investigation.

01:04:17.476 --> 01:04:20.144
I'm sure they'll come after us
for all the other stuff, too.

01:04:20.146 --> 01:04:23.447
So we're just going to run
and hide like fucking chickens?

01:04:25.217 --> 01:04:27.219
All right. You just do
as I fucking say, okay?

01:04:30.322 --> 01:04:32.389
<i>Everything was taken
to a new level.</i>

01:04:32.391 --> 01:04:34.460
<i>Terror has swept
across Norway.</i>

01:04:35.127 --> 01:04:36.994
<i>He was stabbed to death.</i>

01:04:36.996 --> 01:04:38.962
<i>I could feel the cops
snooping around the store.</i>

01:04:38.964 --> 01:04:42.566
<i>The Norwegian police are still
looking for the suspects responsible.</i>

01:04:42.568 --> 01:04:43.969
<i>They had their eyes on me.</i>

01:04:44.503 --> 01:04:46.671
<i>They were on to me.</i>

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:48.105
<i>Or was I just
getting paranoid?</i>

01:04:48.107 --> 01:04:49.506
<i>...police are still looking...</i>

01:04:49.508 --> 01:04:51.375
<i>All of this became
bigger than expected.</i>

01:04:51.377 --> 01:04:53.177
<i>Terror...</i>

01:04:53.179 --> 01:04:55.649
<i>Our fucked-up fantasies have turned
into an even more fucked-up reality.</i>

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:58.315
<i>This is not what
I signed up for.</i>

01:04:58.317 --> 01:05:00.984
<i>I wanted out, but I couldn't
find the fucking door.</i>

01:05:00.986 --> 01:05:03.557
<i>The police have launched
an investigation.</i>

01:05:04.458 --> 01:05:05.725
Fuck.

01:05:12.899 --> 01:05:16.568
<i>All this evil and dark crap
was supposed to be fun.</i>

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:19.071
<i>I was sick and tired
of everything going to shit,</i>

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.144
<i>so I decided to move forward and
focus on myself and the future.</i>

01:05:33.553 --> 01:05:35.555
<i>It was
around 6:00 this morning...</i>

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:43.996
<i>Tonight's fire at the Methodist church
in Sarpsborg left one fireman dead.</i>

01:05:48.802 --> 01:05:50.804
All right. Let's go.

01:05:52.004 --> 01:05:53.340
Stand still.

01:05:54.908 --> 01:05:55.976
Lift your head more.

01:05:59.713 --> 01:06:00.881
Move your head.

01:06:06.052 --> 01:06:08.720
Now look at me
just with your eyes.

01:06:08.722 --> 01:06:09.891
Okay, maybe not.

01:06:12.392 --> 01:06:14.728
Okay, move your eyes
more to the right.

01:06:15.729 --> 01:06:16.962
There.

01:06:16.964 --> 01:06:17.965
Perfect.

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:20.233
Don't be so serious.

01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:08.649
Yeah.

01:07:09.149 --> 01:07:10.449
Sorry.

01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:11.452
Ow.

01:07:14.622 --> 01:07:15.723
Looks good.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.722
What's on your mind?

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.395
Pull the fucking trigger!

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:32.667
Ahhh!

01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:08.401
Good morning.

01:09:08.403 --> 01:09:09.404
Hey.

01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:20.982
Ah.

01:09:28.055 --> 01:09:29.791
You really miss him, don't you?

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.635
No.

01:09:54.282 --> 01:09:58.284
This is it, the biggest
cathedral in all of Norway.

01:09:58.286 --> 01:10:00.320
We'll have it
on the album cover.

01:10:00.322 --> 01:10:01.554
Nice.

01:10:01.556 --> 01:10:03.157
It's from the 1100s.

01:10:03.159 --> 01:10:06.559
And now, in 1993,
we're gonna blow it up.

01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:08.497
Wait, blow it up?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.935
- You guys ready?
- Come on, let's go guys.

01:10:16.906 --> 01:10:18.672
Varg's already burned
down seven churches.

01:10:18.674 --> 01:10:20.741
I don't get it.

01:10:20.743 --> 01:10:24.747
You want to have the cathedral on the
cover, but you don't want to blow it up.

01:10:25.313 --> 01:10:26.981
It's just an album cover.

01:10:26.983 --> 01:10:30.050
No. It's not just
an album cover.

01:10:30.052 --> 01:10:32.153
You have Fantoft
on the cover of Aske.

01:10:32.155 --> 01:10:33.486
You even included matches.

01:10:33.488 --> 01:10:35.156
That was a call to action.

01:10:35.158 --> 01:10:39.059
Use the matches to burn down
a church like I did.

01:10:39.061 --> 01:10:41.796
- Come on, Kristian.
- My name is Varg.

01:10:41.798 --> 01:10:43.232
We're in this together.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.999
We want the same thing.

01:10:45.001 --> 01:10:46.066
- We do?
- Yeah.

01:10:46.068 --> 01:10:48.469
In that case, let's get
some fucking dynamite...

01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:50.673
- You guys coming?
- ...and let's blow this up.

01:10:53.075 --> 01:10:54.241
Yeah.

01:10:54.243 --> 01:10:55.342
I will wait in there.

01:10:55.344 --> 01:10:56.477
You do what you want.

01:10:56.479 --> 01:10:57.812
I don't need your blessing.

01:10:57.814 --> 01:11:00.383
I want you and me
to do this together.

01:11:01.818 --> 01:11:03.551
Let's go guys!

01:11:03.553 --> 01:11:04.718
We need to get back in there.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.388
The fact that Norway
is ruled by a dictatorship,

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:12.993
and our people are brainwashed with
empathy and solidarity by the church,

01:11:12.995 --> 01:11:16.397
and their stupid Christianity
doesn't bother you anymore?

01:11:16.399 --> 01:11:18.632
Of course it does.
I hate that shit.

01:11:18.634 --> 01:11:21.836
Either you do it for the cause
and you take action,

01:11:21.838 --> 01:11:24.672
or you do it because
you want attention

01:11:24.674 --> 01:11:27.410
and you want to be a
stupid-ass celebrity rock star.

01:11:28.578 --> 01:11:30.346
You can't have it both ways.

01:12:49.059 --> 01:12:51.493
So that must be his back,
or it's...

01:12:51.495 --> 01:12:53.094
- I think it's his ass.
- Stom...

01:12:53.096 --> 01:12:54.562
Oh.

01:12:54.564 --> 01:12:56.099
He got stabbed in the ass.

01:13:01.339 --> 01:13:02.806
All right, asshole.

01:13:03.408 --> 01:13:04.574
All right.

01:13:10.547 --> 01:13:11.581
Hello?

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:13.450
I'm going public.

01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:15.984
Public...
What are you talking about?

01:13:15.986 --> 01:13:17.320
I'm going to the press.

01:13:17.322 --> 01:13:19.721
We have to take this
to the next level.

01:13:19.723 --> 01:13:21.390
The next level is jail.

01:13:21.392 --> 01:13:25.063
We talk about it in such a way that
our identity will be kept anonymous.

01:13:27.497 --> 01:13:29.731
Wha... What's the point
of going to the press, then?

01:13:29.733 --> 01:13:32.902
We have to introduce them
to the Black Circle.

01:13:32.904 --> 01:13:36.571
They need to know what we've done
and that we intend to do more.

01:13:36.573 --> 01:13:39.574
This is a bad idea. No.

01:13:39.576 --> 01:13:41.609
I'm not asking
for your permission, Oystein.

01:13:41.611 --> 01:13:43.414
Why the fuck
are you calling me, then?

01:13:45.049 --> 01:13:47.817
I don't care what you say.
I'm doing it.

01:13:47.819 --> 01:13:49.718
It's going to affect all of us.
All right?

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.220
I already have the police
following me.

01:13:51.222 --> 01:13:53.155
They're probably
outside your window now.

01:13:53.157 --> 01:13:56.392
You're paranoid,
absolutely paranoid.

01:13:56.394 --> 01:13:58.493
<i>I'm not fucking paranoid.</i>

01:13:58.495 --> 01:14:00.730
If you do this,
we're fucked, Kristian.

01:14:00.732 --> 01:14:03.666
Varg! My name is Varg!

01:14:03.668 --> 01:14:05.735
Okay. Just do
as I fucking say, Varg.

01:14:05.737 --> 01:14:06.904
Fuck you.

01:14:24.555 --> 01:14:27.992
My name is Greifi Grishnackh.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.497
Greifi Grishnackh.

01:14:50.715 --> 01:14:52.384
Greifi Grishnackh.

01:14:56.455 --> 01:14:57.722
Ow...

01:15:24.883 --> 01:15:26.452
Hi, I'm Finn Tonder.

01:15:27.718 --> 01:15:29.555
And this is my photographer.

01:15:31.656 --> 01:15:33.225
Greifi Grishnackh.

01:15:34.126 --> 01:15:35.160
Pardon?

01:15:36.128 --> 01:15:37.662
Greifi Grishnackh.

01:15:38.596 --> 01:15:39.830
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

01:15:39.832 --> 01:15:41.798
Count. Call me the Count.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.899
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:15:42.901 --> 01:15:44.067
Sit down.

01:15:44.069 --> 01:15:45.070
Great.

01:15:46.004 --> 01:15:48.073
Okay, uh,

01:15:49.408 --> 01:15:52.478
you called me,
so what do you want?

01:15:54.913 --> 01:15:58.281
I know who's responsible
for the recent church burnings.

01:15:58.283 --> 01:16:00.250
And who would that be?

01:16:00.252 --> 01:16:02.052
It's... It's a group of people.

01:16:02.054 --> 01:16:04.721
Um, they call themselves
the Black Circle.

01:16:04.723 --> 01:16:07.560
- How many are you?
- Oh, there's six of us, and...

01:16:11.897 --> 01:16:18.068
So you and the so-called Black Circle,
you like to burn down churches.

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:19.405
Why?

01:16:21.073 --> 01:16:22.509
Isn't it obvious?

01:16:26.678 --> 01:16:29.582
Do you know when the first
church was burned down?

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:32.716
Uh, Fantoft?

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:35.453
Uh, not exactly.

01:16:35.455 --> 01:16:40.393
The 6th of June, the sixth
month, at 6:00 in the morning.

01:16:43.829 --> 01:16:45.729
Six-six-six.

01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:47.898
Six-six-six, the number of
seconds, so you're Satanists?

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.666
Whoa! What are you doing?

01:16:49.668 --> 01:16:52.068
He can't take any pictures
of me, for fuck's sake!

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:53.239
Okay, calm down.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.508
No pictures, okay?

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:57.177
Okay.

01:16:59.646 --> 01:17:00.744
Okay, so...

01:17:00.746 --> 01:17:01.845
And why do you do this?

01:17:01.847 --> 01:17:04.215
Is it a protest
against society or...

01:17:04.217 --> 01:17:06.050
Bring us back to our origins.

01:17:06.052 --> 01:17:07.387
Our origins?

01:17:08.154 --> 01:17:09.155
Odin.

01:17:11.391 --> 01:17:16.327
So you believe in paganism, and
you're a Satanist, and you're...

01:17:16.329 --> 01:17:17.829
You're also a Nazi.

01:17:19.399 --> 01:17:21.899
That's a pretty broad
belief system.

01:17:21.901 --> 01:17:25.236
Well, you know,
these things are all connected.

01:17:25.238 --> 01:17:28.673
That may be hard for a journalist
and normal people to comprehend.

01:17:28.675 --> 01:17:30.410
Yeah. Yes, it is.

01:17:34.747 --> 01:17:37.615
We are going to burn down
every single church

01:17:37.617 --> 01:17:40.551
and blow up the biggest
cathedral in all of Norway,

01:17:40.553 --> 01:17:43.087
and we've been involved
in murder, too.

01:17:43.089 --> 01:17:44.457
Murder?

01:17:45.391 --> 01:17:47.126
In Lillehammer last year.

01:17:49.896 --> 01:17:51.231
The faggot.

01:17:54.901 --> 01:17:56.002
That was you?

01:17:58.738 --> 01:18:00.073
Well, um...

01:18:00.574 --> 01:18:01.808
I can't say.

01:18:05.178 --> 01:18:06.246
Well...

01:18:08.248 --> 01:18:11.351
If you can't say, you know,
I can't write, so...

01:18:12.318 --> 01:18:13.452
Come on. Let's go.

01:18:13.454 --> 01:18:15.721
Wait, are we done already?
Wait a minute.

01:18:15.723 --> 01:18:16.889
Tea, anyone?

01:18:19.792 --> 01:18:22.728
Anyone can put up some
black curtains, light candles,

01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:25.229
and look evil and scary,
you know, with a sword,

01:18:25.231 --> 01:18:29.000
but you haven't told me anything you couldn't
have seen on TV or read about in the papers.

01:18:29.002 --> 01:18:30.901
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait, wait.

01:18:30.903 --> 01:18:34.740
I know one thing that only the one
who burned down Fantoft could know.

01:18:34.742 --> 01:18:36.410
And what would that be?

01:18:38.579 --> 01:18:41.348
There was a dead rabbit
on the steps to the entrance.

01:18:44.652 --> 01:18:45.883
Okay.

01:18:45.885 --> 01:18:47.554
Okay. Let's continue.

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:50.888
But I need some pictures.

01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:51.891
No.

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:54.561
I can't reveal my identity.

01:18:55.895 --> 01:18:57.496
We can work around that.

01:18:57.498 --> 01:18:59.064
Yeah. There's no problem.

01:18:59.066 --> 01:19:00.232
No.

01:19:00.234 --> 01:19:02.067
Tell me everything you remember.

01:19:02.069 --> 01:19:04.503
- Okay.
- You know, just let your hair...

01:19:04.505 --> 01:19:07.072
- Hang?
- ...hang down to cover your face.

01:19:07.074 --> 01:19:08.075
Perfect.

01:19:09.576 --> 01:19:11.410
- Can we use this?
- Yeah.

01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:13.478
- Uh, do you have a lighter?
- Yeah.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.180
- Can you burn it?
- Okay.

01:19:15.182 --> 01:19:16.583
Fantastic. Great.

01:19:17.084 --> 01:19:18.585
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

01:19:19.553 --> 01:19:20.721
Okay.

01:19:23.057 --> 01:19:24.892
- Can you hold this?
- Yeah.

01:19:28.128 --> 01:19:29.630
And maybe you can have that.

01:19:31.899 --> 01:19:33.565
- It looks very evil.
- Yeah.

01:19:33.567 --> 01:19:38.738
Maybe you can just look
with one eye, like an evil eye.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:41.241
- Yeah.
- You can't see my face, right?

01:19:41.909 --> 01:19:43.243
No, not at all.

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.978
What a fucking idiot.

01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:51.651
Yes, but that fucking idiot will
be on the front page tomorrow.

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:01.828
<i>The suspect, 19
years old, known as The Count,</i>

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.329
<i>has revealed that he
and five other people belong</i>

01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:06.967
<i>to an anti-establishment
Black Satanist...</i>

01:20:07.569 --> 01:20:09.267
Fucking idiot!

01:20:09.269 --> 01:20:14.340
<i>In just a heartbeat, the Black
Circle became a fucking circus show.</i>

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:17.909
<i>Varg was the ringmaster, and
we were all his fucking clowns,</i>

01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:19.645
<i>and he enjoyed
every minute of it.</i>

01:20:19.647 --> 01:20:20.749
Seriously?

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.318
You guys got nothing on me.

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:27.455
So fucking cool.

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.724
Varg's a celebrity now.

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:33.226
Did your father
stop paying the rent?

01:20:33.228 --> 01:20:34.629
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

01:20:35.797 --> 01:20:37.064
You're gonna kill your father?

01:20:38.065 --> 01:20:40.899
- That's fucking sick.
- No, Varg.

01:20:40.901 --> 01:20:43.071
- I'm gonna kill Varg.
- Oh, okay.

01:20:44.905 --> 01:20:48.007
I'm going to use this
and paralyze that fucking idiot,

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:51.778
drag him to the forest, tie him
to a tree, torture him to death,

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.182
and make a fucking snuff film
out of the whole thing.

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:56.851
For real?

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.889
He fucked it up for all of us!

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.101
We're closed.

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:17.807
<i>Hello. I'm trying to reach
the guitarist from Mayhem.</i>

01:21:18.406 --> 01:21:19.873
Who's this?

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.975
My name is Jason Arnold, I'm calling
from Kerrang! Magazine in London.

01:21:22.977 --> 01:21:26.412
"Kerrang! Magazine."
That's funny.

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:29.515
Fuck you, Jan Axel.

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:32.719
I'm trying to get a hold
of Euronymous, the, uh...

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.723
The creator of true
Norwegian Black Metal.

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:39.726
That would be me.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:42.161
It's only a matter of time
before Kristian...

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:44.565
Uh, Varg...
I mean The Count,

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:45.998
gets released from jail.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.668
I said it all along.

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:51.404
I'm not saying he didn't do anything,
the police don't have shit on him.

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:55.074
<i>With the Count locked up, who is
running the Black Circle for him?</i>

01:21:55.076 --> 01:21:57.913
I am. I've been the leader
from the beginning,

01:21:58.481 --> 01:22:00.112
with the Count.

01:22:00.114 --> 01:22:04.083
Write this... The Count and Euronymous
share leadership of the Black Circle,

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:07.086
but I'm the creator
of true Norwegian Black Metal.

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:09.222
So let's talk a little
about your band.

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:11.157
What's going on with Mayhem?

01:22:11.159 --> 01:22:15.631
Uh, I'm releasing Mayhem's new
album, D <i>e Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.</i>

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.998
D-E-M-Y.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.132
No.

01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:21.735
Yeah, "Y"...

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:24.638
I mean, we... We had a little
setback when our singer, Dead,

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.306
blew his brains out, but...

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:30.009
<i>Lots of rumors about photos
of his dead body and necklaces</i>

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:32.479
<i>made from parts of his skull</i>

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:34.748
<i>and you eating
part of his brain.</i>

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:37.818
We're not normal people.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.887
<i>We're not afraid
of a dead body.</i>

01:22:39.889 --> 01:22:42.556
It's not every day you get
the chance to see one...

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:43.559
<i>Um...</i>

01:22:44.894 --> 01:22:45.895
Or taste it.

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:10.152
<i>Hello?</i>

01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:14.891
<i>Hello?</i>

01:23:15.992 --> 01:23:17.291
<i>You still there?</i>

01:23:17.293 --> 01:23:18.960
Yeah.

01:23:18.962 --> 01:23:21.729
<i>So what's gonna happen now with
the Black Metal scene in Norway?</i>

01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:24.133
Only the man
with the horns knows.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.236
We're all his slaves
anyway, right?

01:23:31.407 --> 01:23:32.576
You there?

01:23:46.623 --> 01:23:47.891
<i>Varg was right.</i>

01:23:48.558 --> 01:23:50.892
<i>The police had no evidence,</i>

01:23:50.894 --> 01:23:53.797
<i>so they had to release him,
and he was back on the streets.</i>

01:23:56.165 --> 01:24:01.234
<i>Norwegian Black Metal became infamous
after our feature in Kerrang! Magazine.</i>

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:03.473
<i>Mayhem was once again
gaining momentum.</i>

01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:06.674
<i>I looked forward to seeing him.</i>

01:24:06.676 --> 01:24:08.676
<i>We had a lot to talk about.</i>

01:24:08.678 --> 01:24:10.246
Can you fucking believe it?

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:12.315
Kerrang!

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.553
It's weird.

01:24:18.555 --> 01:24:20.622
Your name is
all over the magazine.

01:24:20.624 --> 01:24:22.357
Says the guy on the cover.

01:24:22.359 --> 01:24:26.728
I'm on the cover because I talked to the
press, and now you're taking credit for that.

01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:28.396
You were against that, remember?

01:24:28.398 --> 01:24:29.631
Yeah, I was not against it.

01:24:29.633 --> 01:24:31.399
- I was just...
- Fuck.

01:24:31.401 --> 01:24:33.568
You always do that.

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.472
You take credit for everything.

01:24:36.506 --> 01:24:38.909
You think you're the brains
behind it all?

01:24:40.176 --> 01:24:42.777
- What do you mean?
- We all took action, everyone except you.

01:24:42.779 --> 01:24:44.512
You did nothing.

01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:46.814
I'm the one hounded
by journalists.

01:24:46.816 --> 01:24:51.856
I'm the one who can't show my fucking
face without being recognized.

01:24:53.057 --> 01:24:54.224
It's worth it, isn't it?

01:24:55.592 --> 01:24:56.959
How's it feel?

01:24:56.961 --> 01:24:58.660
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:24:58.662 --> 01:25:00.395
Being a celebrity.

01:25:00.397 --> 01:25:02.165
You should enjoy
the fucking ride.

01:25:03.566 --> 01:25:06.236
I'm going to release
my music on my own label.

01:25:07.404 --> 01:25:09.071
What does that mean?

01:25:09.073 --> 01:25:10.573
I don't need you anymore.

01:25:15.146 --> 01:25:18.147
Okay. If that's what
you want, okay.

01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:21.850
You'll have to find another
idiot to steal everything from.

01:25:21.852 --> 01:25:23.351
I haven't stolen
anything from you.

01:25:23.353 --> 01:25:27.056
You're recording Mayhem's album
with money made from Burzum's sales,

01:25:27.058 --> 01:25:28.123
money that belongs to me.

01:25:28.125 --> 01:25:29.792
That money went straight
back to you.

01:25:29.794 --> 01:25:32.295
You're the bass player
of Mayhem now, remember?

01:25:34.832 --> 01:25:36.000
I quit.

01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:41.572
You only put me in the band
to get attention.

01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:43.908
The album's almost finished.

01:25:45.009 --> 01:25:47.843
It's gonna be big,
world tour, everything.

01:25:47.845 --> 01:25:50.946
Tour? I thought you were
true Norwegian Black Metal.

01:25:50.948 --> 01:25:53.584
- I fucking invented it.
- And now you betray it.

01:25:54.652 --> 01:25:56.351
You're a hypocrite.

01:25:56.353 --> 01:26:00.989
We should be making true Black
Metal music for a select few.

01:26:00.991 --> 01:26:03.726
Tours are for posers.

01:26:03.728 --> 01:26:05.794
"Never sell out,"
that's what you said.

01:26:05.796 --> 01:26:10.133
Saying things like
"never sell out" fucking sells.

01:26:10.135 --> 01:26:13.335
Come on.
I made all that shit up.

01:26:13.337 --> 01:26:15.003
Nobody gave a shit about us.

01:26:15.005 --> 01:26:19.075
I attracted people by saying,
"You can't have this..."

01:26:19.077 --> 01:26:21.410
"You're not worthy."
It's just promotion.

01:26:21.412 --> 01:26:22.847
No, no.

01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:27.418
Not for me.

01:26:29.087 --> 01:26:31.522
I believed in it,
and I still do.

01:26:33.724 --> 01:26:35.060
So do I.

01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:39.963
But it has to make sense.
It has to sell.

01:26:39.965 --> 01:26:42.399
Otherwise, what the fuck
are we doing here?

01:26:51.642 --> 01:26:54.645
You can keep that. That's
a piece of chicken bone.

01:26:57.749 --> 01:26:58.750
Chicken bone?

01:27:01.352 --> 01:27:03.255
Fake as everything else
with you.

01:27:11.062 --> 01:27:12.228
Fuck.

01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:14.731
<i>Oystein says
he's gonna kill him.</i>

01:27:14.733 --> 01:27:16.968
Says he's going to paralyze him
with his taser or something.

01:27:18.335 --> 01:27:21.838
Says he's gonna
torture him to death,

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:25.477
film the whole thing, make
a fucking snuff movie out of it.

01:27:33.418 --> 01:27:34.586
So how'd it go?

01:27:35.587 --> 01:27:37.422
Uh, stay out of it.

01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:40.392
Why do you care
about him so much?

01:27:41.793 --> 01:27:42.994
I don't.

01:27:43.495 --> 01:27:44.796
Yeah, you do.

01:27:46.299 --> 01:27:49.334
I don't understand the strange
competition you have with this guy.

01:27:51.169 --> 01:27:52.635
I mean, he acts like
he's the real deal,

01:27:52.637 --> 01:27:54.240
but we all know
he's a fucking fake.

01:27:55.174 --> 01:27:57.176
Yeah, that's what
he says about me.

01:27:58.743 --> 01:28:02.347
Seriously, Oystein, stay the fuck
away from him and sort your shit out.

01:28:09.322 --> 01:28:13.389
Look, you have
this dream, this vision.

01:28:13.391 --> 01:28:16.392
You were in control.
You were a leader.

01:28:16.394 --> 01:28:18.830
You could still be all of
those things if you wanted to.

01:28:23.336 --> 01:28:24.736
Or are you just full of shit?

01:28:31.244 --> 01:28:32.245
I just...

01:28:35.348 --> 01:28:38.251
I mean, things have
been really, um...

01:28:46.893 --> 01:28:48.060
I have to, um...

01:29:06.512 --> 01:29:10.750
<i>"Varg, attaching a contract

01:29:12.585 --> 01:29:16.253

01:29:55.828 --> 01:29:56.996
<i>I felt relieved.</i>

01:29:59.899 --> 01:30:01.399
<i>I hope he felt the same.</i>

01:30:01.401 --> 01:30:03.736
Time to leave now,
you fucking whore.

01:30:14.647 --> 01:30:19.351
So, Faust said Oystein was going
to attack me with his taser gun,

01:30:19.353 --> 01:30:20.418
and drag me into the forest?

01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:21.752
Yeah.

01:30:21.754 --> 01:30:25.025
And then kill you and make a
snuff movie of the whole thing.

01:30:28.228 --> 01:30:30.063
But I don't think he means it.

01:30:34.735 --> 01:30:36.336
Of course not.

01:30:41.008 --> 01:30:42.142
Ah.

01:30:44.678 --> 01:30:45.846
Ah.

Come on.

01:31:39.733 --> 01:31:40.801
Hey! Get up!

01:31:42.236 --> 01:31:44.236
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

01:31:44.238 --> 01:31:45.504
- What? Where?
- Let's go!

01:31:45.506 --> 01:31:46.507
Now!

01:32:05.893 --> 01:32:07.128
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32:11.165 --> 01:32:12.666
Are you sure
you want to do this?

01:32:32.086 --> 01:32:33.321
Have you seen this?

01:32:37.091 --> 01:32:38.424
Yeah, I've seen it.

01:32:38.426 --> 01:32:41.095
Okay, we're gonna say we watched
this tonight at my place.

01:32:41.762 --> 01:32:43.496
To who?

01:32:43.498 --> 01:32:45.898
Don't ask questions,
just drive.

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:46.901
Okay.

01:33:15.297 --> 01:33:16.398
You trust me?

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.568
- Do it.
- All right.

01:33:28.577 --> 01:33:29.677
Hold on, hold on.

01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:36.851
Okay. Sorry.

01:33:38.086 --> 01:33:39.254
Okay.

01:33:48.963 --> 01:33:50.065
Oh.

01:34:09.585 --> 01:34:12.187
Stop... Stop moving.

01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:58.501
Hey!

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:02.672
What the hell are you doing?

01:35:03.071 --> 01:35:04.072
Getting gas.

01:35:05.675 --> 01:35:08.409
All right. Do it quickly.
We gotta keep going.

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:10.578
- I don't have any cash.
- Fucking...

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.178
Goddamn it.
You fucking...

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.682
Well, me neither,
and we can't use my credit card.

01:35:14.684 --> 01:35:17.251
We've just got enough gas
to go back home.

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:18.354
Let's go back.

01:35:23.025 --> 01:35:25.194
Here. Take it.
I'll report it stolen.

01:35:26.895 --> 01:35:28.331
- Now!
- Okay.

01:35:48.251 --> 01:35:51.020
Fuck! Fucking idiot.

01:36:03.666 --> 01:36:05.134
You wanna hang out tomorrow?

01:36:06.636 --> 01:36:07.637
Maybe.

01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:10.340
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.342
We'll see.

01:36:21.918 --> 01:36:23.417
- Okay.
- All right.

01:36:23.419 --> 01:36:24.753
- I'm gonna leave now.
- All right.

01:36:24.755 --> 01:36:26.757
I'll see you later. Bye.

01:36:46.744 --> 01:36:49.176
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:36:49.178 --> 01:36:51.080
- Let's go!
- Okay!

01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:56.806
Hello?

01:38:56.808 --> 01:38:57.809
<i>Open up.</i>

01:38:58.743 --> 01:39:00.578
- Who's this?
- <i>It's me, Varg.</i>

01:39:01.579 --> 01:39:02.745
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:39:02.747 --> 01:39:04.747
I brought
the contract you sent.

01:39:04.749 --> 01:39:06.014
Why?

01:39:06.016 --> 01:39:09.084
<i>You wanted me to sign it,
and I did, here I am.</i>

01:39:09.086 --> 01:39:10.920
Could have just
fucking mailed it.

01:39:10.922 --> 01:39:14.257
Yes, I could have. But I wanted this
done right away, so I came over.

01:39:14.259 --> 01:39:15.591
- All the way from Bergen?
- Yes.

01:39:15.593 --> 01:39:17.093
- In the middle of the night?
- Yes.

01:39:17.095 --> 01:39:19.697
I'm here now, so why don't you
just open the fucking door?

01:39:50.695 --> 01:39:51.864
Hey.

01:39:57.635 --> 01:39:58.671
Nice hairdo.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.408
You gonna let me in?

01:40:04.576 --> 01:40:05.744
Yeah, come on.

01:40:15.588 --> 01:40:16.922
You signed the contract?

01:40:17.188 --> 01:40:18.354
Yeah.

01:40:18.356 --> 01:40:21.527
All we need now
is for you to sign it.

01:40:22.528 --> 01:40:23.927
Right.

01:40:23.929 --> 01:40:26.264
And then you and me are history.

01:40:27.666 --> 01:40:28.801
Yep.

01:40:29.735 --> 01:40:30.970
It's a small world, though.

01:40:34.238 --> 01:40:35.507
What do you mean?

01:40:37.576 --> 01:40:39.478
We're gonna bump
into each other.

01:40:41.647 --> 01:40:43.415
What are you trying to say?

01:40:45.851 --> 01:40:47.419
Take it easy, man.

01:40:49.922 --> 01:40:51.423
We're cool, okay?

01:40:52.024 --> 01:40:53.190
Okay.

01:40:53.192 --> 01:40:55.594
Like you said
in your letter, friends.

01:41:02.568 --> 01:41:03.902
Where are you going?

01:41:05.237 --> 01:41:06.405
To get a pen,

01:41:07.239 --> 01:41:08.741
to sign the contract.

01:41:14.179 --> 01:41:17.147
You're going to get
your fucking Taser.

01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:19.349
- My what?
- Stop treating me like an idiot!

01:41:19.351 --> 01:41:20.751
- I know what you're up to.
- No, no, no.

01:41:20.753 --> 01:41:22.252
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:41:22.254 --> 01:41:26.256
You pretend to be my friend
so you can hit me off guard.

01:41:26.258 --> 01:41:28.594
I'm not gonna let
that happen, cocksucker.

01:41:28.928 --> 01:41:30.094
Whoa.

01:41:30.096 --> 01:41:32.596
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:41:32.598 --> 01:41:33.766
Oh!

01:41:37.971 --> 01:41:39.403
Wh-why... Why did...

01:41:39.405 --> 01:41:40.938
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.809
Oh. Fuck.

01:41:43.509 --> 01:41:44.576
Um...

01:41:45.912 --> 01:41:48.012
Um, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:41:48.014 --> 01:41:49.513
Okay, okay.
Just wait. Just wait.

01:41:49.515 --> 01:41:51.749
Stop talking, you piece of shit.

01:41:51.751 --> 01:41:53.517
Just leave, okay?

01:41:53.519 --> 01:41:54.988
It's okay...

01:41:55.689 --> 01:41:56.921
It's okay.

01:41:56.923 --> 01:41:58.589
We just forget about all this.

01:41:58.591 --> 01:41:59.757
- No, we can't.
- Yes.

01:41:59.759 --> 01:42:01.358
Yes, we can.

01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.928
We can make a... We can
make a thing out of this.

01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:06.097
Oh! What thing?

01:42:06.099 --> 01:42:08.001
Just think about it
for a second, okay?

01:42:09.569 --> 01:42:12.904
We can spread a rumor
that you almost killed me.

01:42:12.906 --> 01:42:15.473
This could make us look
really fucking evil.

01:42:15.475 --> 01:42:17.975
Yeah. As always,
you don't get it.

01:42:17.977 --> 01:42:20.678
No, I'm serious!
I'm serious.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.513
This is genius.

01:42:22.515 --> 01:42:24.615
This is really smart.

01:42:24.617 --> 01:42:27.585
It's fucking genius.

01:42:27.587 --> 01:42:30.521
- I said shut the fuck up.
- Okay.

01:42:30.523 --> 01:42:31.756
Okay.

01:42:31.758 --> 01:42:33.359
Um, I don't...

01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:35.760
Okay...

01:42:35.762 --> 01:42:37.163
All right.

01:42:39.365 --> 01:42:40.898
What are you looking for?

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:45.405
A knife so you can kill me and make
a snuff film out of the whole thing?

01:42:51.578 --> 01:42:54.247
Stop running away,
you little pussy.

01:42:59.086 --> 01:43:02.089
What's your big plan
now, genius?

01:43:50.004 --> 01:43:51.404
Come on.

01:44:09.322 --> 01:44:10.489
There you go.

01:44:10.491 --> 01:44:15.930
Your stupid contract is signed,
sealed, and delivered.

01:44:17.598 --> 01:44:19.166
You happy now?

01:44:24.738 --> 01:44:25.739
Come on.

01:44:28.142 --> 01:44:30.409
Help! He's trying to kill me.

01:44:30.411 --> 01:44:33.246
"Help! Help!
He's trying to kill me, help!"

01:44:33.248 --> 01:44:34.980
- Open the fucking door.
- "Help!"

01:44:34.982 --> 01:44:36.318
He's killing me.

01:45:07.249 --> 01:45:08.348
Oh, stop.

01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:09.351
Stop it.

01:45:59.601 --> 01:46:00.769
Yeah.

01:46:01.569 --> 01:46:02.671
Oh...

01:46:02.971 --> 01:46:04.005
Where...

01:46:05.006 --> 01:46:07.075
Oh. Oh...

01:46:14.249 --> 01:46:15.318
You just...

01:46:16.084 --> 01:46:17.750
Why did you do this?

01:46:17.752 --> 01:46:19.585
You said you were
going to kill me.

01:46:19.587 --> 01:46:21.923
I wasn't gonna do that. I...

01:46:23.024 --> 01:46:24.360
You know me.

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.928
You're my friend.

01:46:28.596 --> 01:46:30.098
I just talk.

01:46:32.534 --> 01:46:34.103
You know, I just talk.

01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:35.902
Exactly.

01:46:35.904 --> 01:46:37.505
You're an embarrassment.

01:46:39.108 --> 01:46:42.144
That's all you do is talk.

01:46:45.081 --> 01:46:46.246
Wait.

01:46:46.248 --> 01:46:48.681
- That's why you're going to die.
- No, no, no.

01:46:48.683 --> 01:46:51.187
No, no!
No, no, no, no.

01:48:19.075 --> 01:48:22.912
<i>There you have it, my story.</i>

01:48:24.514 --> 01:48:26.082
<i>I told you it was going
to end badly.</i>

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.355
<i>Say cheese.</i>

01:48:41.764 --> 01:48:43.198
<i>...was
found stabbed to death.</i>

01:48:46.002 --> 01:48:49.837
<i>The 25-year-old Oystein Aarseth,
also known as Euronymous,</i>

01:48:49.839 --> 01:48:54.909
<i>was a musician in a Norwegian
Black Metal band, Mayhem.</i>

01:48:54.911 --> 01:48:57.746
<i>The police have
described the murder as ruthless...</i>

01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:03.585
<i>He was the
leader of a band called...</i>

01:49:03.587 --> 01:49:05.422
<i>the Satanic group
the Black Circle.</i>

01:49:14.097 --> 01:49:15.532
Can you get the door, honey?

01:49:21.638 --> 01:49:22.839
Who is it?

01:49:25.342 --> 01:49:27.077
- What's going on?
- Let's go.

01:49:29.913 --> 01:49:32.649
It's going to be great.
It's gonna be so packed.

01:49:33.484 --> 01:49:34.751
We were watching...

01:49:36.987 --> 01:49:38.155
<i>Die Hard 2.</i>

01:49:38.922 --> 01:49:39.923
Oh, yeah...

01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:41.825
What's it about?

01:49:43.827 --> 01:49:47.197
It's about someone
dying hard twice.

01:49:48.466 --> 01:49:49.534
I'm not sure.

01:49:55.172 --> 01:49:58.507
<i>The murder investigation
of the young Norwegian, Oystein Aarseth,</i>

01:49:58.509 --> 01:50:01.743
<i>took a new turn today when one
of Oystein's closest friends...</i>

01:50:01.745 --> 01:50:06.181
<i>Varg Vikernes, better known as The
Count, was arrested this morning</i>

01:50:06.183 --> 01:50:09.085
<i>and is now the main suspect
in the brutal murder.</i>

01:50:46.090 --> 01:50:50.326
<i>No. Fuck. Stop
this sentimental shit. Stop!</i>

01:50:50.328 --> 01:50:54.196
<i>There's nothing sad
about my death or my life.</i>

01:50:54.198 --> 01:50:57.700
<i>I'm Euronymous,
founder of Mayhem,</i>

01:50:57.702 --> 01:51:00.436
