WEBVTT

00:07.132 --> 00:08.340
Hey.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.844
- What you guys doing?
- Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

00:13.972 --> 00:17.641
Why are you guys upset?
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.310
- What?
- What are you talking about?

00:20.478 --> 00:22.771
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.565
Frontier fun!

00:26.484 --> 00:28.277
Pheebs, what about the end?

00:28.445 --> 00:31.613
Oh, when Yeller saves the family
from the wolf and everyone's happy?

00:31.781 --> 00:32.990
That's not the end.

00:33.158 --> 00:37.077
Yeah-huh. That's when my mother would
shut off the TV and say, "The end."

00:38.663 --> 00:40.581
What about when he has rabies?

00:40.749 --> 00:43.125
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.754
That's what my mom said.

00:47.380 --> 00:51.550
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.178
Why? What's about to happen?

00:54.387 --> 00:56.180
I've never seen this part.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.391
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.145
Oh, no.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.606
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.567
No, no, he's your buddy.
He's your Yeller.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.235
No! The end! The end!

01:13.823 --> 01:16.992
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff film is this?

02:07.001 --> 02:11.505
Have you guys eaten? Uh, Richard and I
just finished, and we've got leftovers.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.799
Chicken and potatoes.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.718
What am I wearing?

02:17.762 --> 02:19.847
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

02:25.854 --> 02:29.398
One of these times, you'll really
be naked and we won't come over.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.276
I got a leg, three breasts
and a wing.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.404
How do you find clothes that fit?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.740
Oh, hey, Monica? We got a question.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.327
All right, yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.996
And no, I don't look.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.206
No, not that one.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.334
We're figuring out who to bring
to the Knicks game.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.796
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend
Eric Prower, who has breath issues...

02:54.757 --> 02:57.551
...and Dan, with the poking.
"Did you see that play?"

02:58.261 --> 03:00.888
"You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?"

03:01.055 --> 03:03.265
Ha, ha, okay.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.976
Why don't you ask Richard?

03:06.895 --> 03:10.147
Uh, Richard, if you had an extra
ticket to the Knicks game...

03:13.109 --> 03:16.111
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smelled...

03:16.321 --> 03:20.032
...and one who bruises you,
who would you pick?

03:20.241 --> 03:21.491
Wow.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.493
Being a huge Knicks fan myself...

03:23.745 --> 03:27.748
...I think you should take someone
who's a huge Knicks fan.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.666
Okay.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.418
That's Eric.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.838
Glad to be of help. Matches.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.550
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.302
Eh.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.887
What?

03:42.889 --> 03:44.890
- I don't know.
- Come on!

03:45.141 --> 03:49.561
He keeps his fingers to himself,
and he's always minty fresh.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.315
Richard's really nice.
Uh, we just don't know him really well.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.234
Plus, he's old...

03:57.570 --> 03:59.988
- er than some people.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.075
But, uh, younger than some buildings.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.704
So what, he's a little older.
Big deal.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.498
He's important to me.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.626
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.589
How do we say yes...

04:18.841 --> 04:21.593
...and make it seem like it's not
just to ride in the cool car?

04:23.596 --> 04:25.264
Okay, this could be tough.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.225
Okay, okay, okay. Monica?

04:28.393 --> 04:31.895
We'll bring him,
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.275
Ooh, you almost had it.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.866
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.994
- Hello, ha, ha.
- Hey.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.829
Hi, honey. Oh.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.498
You are not gonna believe
what happened!

04:51.708 --> 04:54.876
We were playing on the floor,
and he grabs the table...

04:55.128 --> 04:57.087
...and he pulls himself up!

04:58.589 --> 05:00.674
He pulled himself up!

05:00.883 --> 05:02.384
Standing man!

05:03.594 --> 05:07.264
I'm sorry you missed it,
but I did tape it if you wanna see it.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.392
Uh, we know.
He already did it last week.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.728
You can watch our tape if you want.

05:12.895 --> 05:17.316
Ah, see, I don't believe this.
I missed the first time of everything.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.736
The first time he rolled over,
the first time he crawled.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.280
What else? Has he spoken?
Is he driving?

05:23.531 --> 05:26.158
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.827
He is getting closer
on the talking thing.

05:29.078 --> 05:32.372
He can't quite say "mama" yet,
but once he said "Yemen."

05:32.540 --> 05:36.376
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.172
I want him for more than a day.
I want him for a whole weekend.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.423
Listen. I feel...

05:41.591 --> 05:43.008
That would be great.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.680
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.974
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.395
Oh, look, did you just see that?

05:55.646 --> 05:58.190
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.692
He's never waved before!

06:00.860 --> 06:03.153
Yes, he has. Very good.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.325
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. What you got there?

06:08.576 --> 06:12.454
Love Story, Brian's Song and
Terms of Endearment.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.332
Wow, all you need now
is The Killing Fields...

06:15.500 --> 06:18.126
...and some guacamole,
and you got yourself a party!

06:19.420 --> 06:22.464
I talked to my grandma
about the Old Yeller incident...

06:22.715 --> 06:26.468
...and she said my mom used to not
show us the ends of sad movies...

06:26.719 --> 06:29.388
...to shield us from
the pain and sadness.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.182
You know, before she killed herself.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.230
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

06:38.815 --> 06:41.483
After we stole his lunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.278
What's the matter with you?
He's parking the car.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.991
- Did you guys have fun?
- Your boyfriend is so cool.

06:50.159 --> 06:54.204
He let us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.914
Wow.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.582
He must like you best.

06:58.292 --> 07:01.586
Oh, what about when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.713
You never even saw the money.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.675
Hey, Chandler, thanks for
showing us to our seats.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.804
Ha, ha, you're welcome.
Hey, Joey, thanks for parking the car.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.681
No problem, ha, ha.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.184
- Hey, Chandler...
- I think they get it.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.021
There's the man!

07:20.189 --> 07:21.982
Hey.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.900
- Hey, you're getting better.
- Huh? Ha, ha.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.111
I'm gonna keep this.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.071
Okay.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.322
He kept my dollar.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.165
Your first weekend without Ben.
What are you doing?

07:38.374 --> 07:40.292
Ah, we're going to
colonial Williamsburg.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.963
A woman I went to college with is
the first female blacksmith there.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.383
They're a little behind the times
in colonial Williamsburg.

07:48.551 --> 07:52.095
Ha, ha. Well, look, I better go
before Mommy starts weeping.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.265
- We love you.
- Bye, Mommy.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.309
Have a good time.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.436
Okay, Ben.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.687
- Ross.
- Yeah?

08:00.855 --> 08:01.938
Look.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.656
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

08:13.242 --> 08:15.785
How come Richard looks cooler
with one of these?

08:15.953 --> 08:18.914
You may wanna light it
and lose the spatula.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.710
It's cute, you trying
to be more like Richard.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.670
Not like him, per se.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.048
Just not unlike him.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.809
It's the artist formerly known
as Chandler.

08:42.395 --> 08:45.232
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

08:45.399 --> 08:47.150
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

08:47.401 --> 08:48.527
Oh, we flipped for it.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.570
I got the cigar,
he got the mustache.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.865
If we both grew them,
we'd look like dorks.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.203
You really sidestepped
that land mine.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.540
I promised Richard
we'd meet downstairs.

09:01.707 --> 09:02.791
You're meeting Richard?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.668
- Ranger game.
- Didn't he tell you?

09:04.835 --> 09:08.213
He said he was going out with the guys.
I didn't know that was you.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.589
You hear that?

09:09.840 --> 09:12.759
- We're the guys!
- We're the guys!

09:12.927 --> 09:15.512
With that mustache,
he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.013
Thank you!

09:26.065 --> 09:28.567
- Hi, we're visiting.
- Yay.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.778
It's Ben and his dada.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.114
Dada.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.992
- Can you say "dada"?
- Aw.

09:37.159 --> 09:40.287
I'm telling your mommies you said it,
so you might as well.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.080
- No luck, huh?
- No.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.541
A while ago,
I got a "seh" out of him...

09:44.792 --> 09:49.671
...which I thought might turn into
"seh-condary caregiver," but...

09:52.633 --> 09:55.385
Would you, uh, hold him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.471
- Oh, yeah, sure, okay.
- There we go.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.520
What are you doing?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.647
I'm holding Ben.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.568
Yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.612
Okay.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.572
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.617
This is how I would hold a football.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.036
Here. Here. There we go.

10:21.203 --> 10:25.582
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.917
- I mean, you know, since I was one.
- Ha, ha.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.962
- It's all right. No big deal.
- Really?

10:31.130 --> 10:34.049
You'll feel different
when it's our baby.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.967
- What?
- What?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.678
You think about stuff like that?

10:38.888 --> 10:41.598
Uh, yeah. I mean...

10:42.642 --> 10:46.186
Actually, I kind of think
that we'll have two babies.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.981
Two babies?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.233
You know, a boy and a girl.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.820
Hopefully, the girl will come first,
so Ben won't feel competitive.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.408
Then what's gonna happen?

11:00.576 --> 11:04.663
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.414
Scar... Uh-huh.

11:06.624 --> 11:10.043
We'll be far enough from our parents
so we don't have to see them...

11:10.211 --> 11:12.671
...but close enough
that they can babysit.

11:12.838 --> 11:17.092
And yes, I know the taxes are
a little higher than Nassau County...

11:17.343 --> 11:19.344
...but the school system's great.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.055
Wow! Ha, ha.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.891
Wow, that's great! Great!

11:25.685 --> 11:27.727
- Okay, wow! You know what?
- Hmm?

11:27.937 --> 11:30.605
I'm off my break now. So, uh...

11:30.773 --> 11:32.732
Um, here. You take this.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.901
And, um...

11:35.236 --> 11:38.154
I'm gonna go pour these
very nice people some coffee.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.447
Okay.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.658
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.285
I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.871
Or in Scarsdale.
Hey, is that a door?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.623
Rach.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.088
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

11:55.256 --> 11:59.551
Oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams
eating each other in the Andes.

12:01.637 --> 12:03.263
- You watched the movies?
Uh-huh.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.099
What is happening to the world?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.477
I mean...
No, no, because E.T. Leaves...

12:09.729 --> 12:12.355
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

12:12.523 --> 12:14.065
Charlotte who?

12:14.316 --> 12:15.608
With the web. The spider.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.986
She dies. She has babies and dies.

12:18.195 --> 12:21.281
It's like, "Welcome home
from the hospital." Thud!

12:22.950 --> 12:24.033
You wanna feel better?

12:24.201 --> 12:26.619
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.873
Here. Watch this.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.709
It's a Wonderful Life.
Yes, I've heard of this.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.503
So you can't lose.
It's there in the title.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.422
Wonderfulness is baked right in.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.091
I fell for that with
Pride of the Yankees.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.385
I thought I'd see a film
about Yankee pride.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.722
And boom! The guy gets
Lou Gehrig's disease.

12:46.474 --> 12:51.728
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.357
Watch that. It'll restore
all your faith in humanity.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.235
Hey, big guy. Game time.

12:59.403 --> 13:02.280
- Hey! Be right there!
- There's a game?

13:02.448 --> 13:05.617
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.745
Bring your nerves of steel.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.041
It's the basketball playoffs.

13:13.292 --> 13:17.754
Um, I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.464
They have each other.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.841
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.970
I like hanging out with them.
They're different than my other friends.

13:26.180 --> 13:30.225
They don't start sentences with "You
know who just died shoveling snow?"

13:31.435 --> 13:33.645
All right, that's great.
Then just go.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.480
Go Knicks!

13:35.648 --> 13:37.941
- Uh, it's the college playoffs.
- Oh.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.527
- Then, go Vassar!
- Uh, they're not in it.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.571
- Okay, then just go.
- Okay.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.658
Ugh, why does this bother me
so much?

13:46.909 --> 13:51.704
I'm not one of those people who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.164
Sure.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.501
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

13:56.669 --> 14:00.630
Does it matter? You'll just die
or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.718
- Ugh!
- Me too!

14:05.886 --> 14:09.347
Rachel, I got a question. Richard
made plans again with the guys...

14:09.515 --> 14:11.474
Ross made plans for the century.

14:11.642 --> 14:15.645
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

14:15.855 --> 14:20.608
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini
wax with leftover Christmas candles.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.528
Okay.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.530
What happened back there?

14:25.781 --> 14:27.532
I don't know. You tell me.

14:27.741 --> 14:30.493
One minute I'm holding Ben,
then I've got two kids...

14:30.703 --> 14:33.663
...I'm living in Scarsdale
complaining about taxes!

14:33.914 --> 14:36.499
Well, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

14:36.750 --> 14:40.545
You're at work, you're assembling bones,
your mind wanders.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.382
You've planned out the next 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

14:44.550 --> 14:46.467
You never think about our future?

14:46.677 --> 14:49.762
I think about whose apartment
we'll sleep at tomorrow...

14:49.930 --> 14:52.098
...and where we'll have dinner
next Saturday!

14:52.266 --> 14:54.851
I do not think about
our children's names!

14:56.145 --> 14:58.813
You know what our
children's names will be?

14:59.023 --> 15:00.481
Ha, ha, no.

15:00.649 --> 15:04.277
No, I mean, you know. I read a book,
and there was a girl named Emily.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.696
And I thought that might be good.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.574
What was the book?

15:10.826 --> 15:12.702
The Big Book of Children's Names.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.163
Okay. Ross, Ross.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.497
Okay, listen.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.166
What we have is amazing.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.252
But I do not want
everything decided for me!

15:21.420 --> 15:23.046
I spent my whole life like that.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.924
It's what I had with Barry.
That's a reason I left.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.092
I like not knowing right now.

15:28.260 --> 15:32.305
Sorry if that scares you, but if you
wanna be with me, deal with that!

15:32.473 --> 15:34.265
- Okay, fine!
- Thank you!

15:34.433 --> 15:36.809
- We're not done!
- I didn't know that.

15:37.311 --> 15:41.356
You're with a guy who won't stop
planning his future with you.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.399
He knows we'll end up together.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.819
If that scares you, tough!
You'll have to deal with that.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.988
- I will!
- Good, because I love you!

15:49.156 --> 15:50.740
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

15:50.908 --> 15:53.159
- That's the first time we've said that!
- Yes.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.828
- I'm gonna kiss you!
- You better!

16:02.044 --> 16:03.586
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.338
Oh, thanks for the great movie tip.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.423
- Did you like it?
- Oh, yeah.

16:07.591 --> 16:11.177
I don't know if I was happier when
George Bailey destroyed the business...

16:11.345 --> 16:15.264
...or, um, Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bleed.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.978
I'll give you the ear thing,
but wasn't the ending wonderful?

16:20.145 --> 16:22.313
I didn't watch it.
I was too depressed.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.816
It kept getting worse!
It should've been called:

16:25.067 --> 16:29.362
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

16:32.116 --> 16:33.533
Kick, save! And...

16:33.784 --> 16:35.034
...denied!

16:35.786 --> 16:39.706
He gets it back.
Pass to the middle, lines it up and bam!

16:39.873 --> 16:40.957
Yes!

16:41.125 --> 16:44.293
Could that shot be any prettier?

16:44.878 --> 16:46.504
Man, you are incredible.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.464
We had a table in college.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.967
Oh, really? I didn't know they had
foosball in the 1800s.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.847
Nice mustache. At puberty,
that thing will really kick in.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.480
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,
but dinner's on the table.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.815
One more point.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.069
Score!

17:11.613 --> 17:13.196
- Now can we go?
- Uh...

17:13.781 --> 17:15.907
That's why we don't let her play.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.954
- Is everything all right?
- Mm-hm.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.205
Uh-oh.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.709
Oh, hey, don't be mad at him.
It's our fault.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.877
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.213
He's just really great
to hang out with.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.631
- Well...
- No, seriously.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.343
We just talked about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.515
Our dads are okay and all,
but Richard is just...

17:39.683 --> 17:41.893
Ow, ow, ow.
What are you kicking me for?

17:42.936 --> 17:45.980
Huh? I'm trying to talk here.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.359
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.320
- Oh, yeah.
- No!

17:53.614 --> 17:54.697
No.

17:56.116 --> 18:00.244
You're just clearly not familiar
with our young persons' vernacular.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.831
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

18:04.666 --> 18:06.542
- We mean "pal."
- Uh-huh, yeah.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.337
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.092
Monica's my dad.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.345
I've even got some dads down at work.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.805
That's fine.

18:18.972 --> 18:23.309
Well, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.603
I'll just see you kids around.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.146
Nighty-night.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.233
- You're not a dad!
- You're not a dad!

18:30.400 --> 18:32.652
I can't believe you got us
into trouble.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.742
So are you okay?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.911
Yeah.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.204
Just...

18:43.372 --> 18:45.832
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.168
I thought I was just one of the guys.

18:49.753 --> 18:50.962
Come here.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.048
I'll make you feel like
one of the guys.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.762
Mm.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.932
For a really cool guy,
you suck at foosball.

19:03.934 --> 19:05.852
I was killing them.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.271
- Yeah, well they suck too.
- Ha, ha.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.857
Hmm.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.027
You take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

19:15.279 --> 19:19.365
Calling it a "poopy diaper"
doesn't make this process any cuter.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.162
- Hello.
- It's us.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.413
Come on up.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.206
I'll get his stuff together.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.418
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.921
Yes, we can.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.884
There! I did it!

19:38.385 --> 19:39.886
Ha, ha, I did it!

19:40.053 --> 19:42.597
Ooh, look at that!

19:42.764 --> 19:45.808
Oh, it stays on and everything.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.727
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.485
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say "hi"?

19:56.695 --> 19:59.530
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

19:59.698 --> 20:01.073
- What?
- Ben just said hi!

20:01.325 --> 20:02.783
What, the word "hi"?

20:02.951 --> 20:04.785
No, my Uncle Hi.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.748
Great! And I missed that too.
I miss everything!

20:08.999 --> 20:12.043
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.880
- Where is he?
- We missed you.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.634
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben, ha, ha.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.303
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.347
What did he say?

20:24.514 --> 20:26.057
Something about hi.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.603
- That's so exciting!
- Mommy's so proud of you!

20:30.771 --> 20:33.022
Hi. Hi?

20:33.190 --> 20:35.316
You know, actually,
it's more like, hi!

20:35.943 --> 20:37.902
- Hi?
- Hi.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.780
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.698
This could go on for a while.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.867
You're right.
We've got a cab waiting.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.869
Well, this was fun.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.997
We should do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

20:50.165 --> 20:51.249
Okay.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.085
- All right, so I've got him?
- Tuesday.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.419
Bye, you guys.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.296
- Take care.
- Bye, Ben.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.382
Bye.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.761
Did he just say "bye"?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.096
He said bye!

21:05.347 --> 21:07.306
You said... He said bye to me!

21:07.557 --> 21:09.433
- Yes, he did!
- Oh.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.270
Suddenly I'm seeing him
go off to college!

21:13.730 --> 21:16.315
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.567
See you later.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.027
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.320
- Oh!
- Ha, ha.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.491
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.535
Bye.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.078
Oh.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.298
Wow. Look at this nice deep hole I dug.
Hey, Bert...

21:40.465 --> 21:42.091
...isn't this a nice hole here?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.342
Okay, ahem.

21:43.552 --> 21:48.055
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

21:48.640 --> 21:53.769
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

21:54.896 --> 21:58.524
But before that happens,
there's some rough going for a while.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.818
But I think we can handle it.

22:01.069 --> 22:06.198
And there's just the alphabet,
but we know that ends well, so...

22:06.575 --> 22:07.742
Here we go.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.327
Bert? Bert?

22:09.494 --> 22:11.203
Bert?

22:11.371 --> 22:14.999
What happened to my friend Bert?
He was here just a moment ago.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.293
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.545
- Mm.
- I'm so glad you're here.
