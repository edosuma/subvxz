00:29.172 --> 00:30.455
I've got visual.

00:30.456 --> 00:32.818
This joker's fast. I'll give him that.

00:37.760 --> 00:40.352
Cap, Panther, he just
disappeared off my grid.

00:40.353 --> 00:41.354
Do you have him?

00:41.355 --> 00:43.277
Wow, HYDRA agents are getting good.

00:43.278 --> 00:45.294
He doesn't even have any powers.

00:45.839 --> 00:46.927
There he is.

00:54.928 --> 00:56.131
Hi there.

00:57.656 --> 00:59.447
Give it up, Hawkeye.

01:02.899 --> 01:04.512
You can't win.

01:05.753 --> 01:07.833
<i>Attention, Avengers.</i>

01:12.862 --> 01:15.121
Hey, where'd he go?

01:18.810 --> 01:20.753
No sign of him, great.

01:30.032 --> 01:31.865
You just let your own traitor get away.

01:31.866 --> 01:34.182
Next time SHIELD wants to help, don't.

01:34.183 --> 01:35.627
Let him go for now.

01:35.628 --> 01:38.322
We didn't come for Hawkeye, Iron-Man.

01:38.323 --> 01:40.455
We came for you and your team.

01:40.456 --> 01:42.007
We need your help.

03:12.079 --> 03:14.334
Look, on the horizon.

03:43.049 --> 03:45.723
What manner of sorcery is this?

03:47.830 --> 03:50.539
Wow, it's pure gamma radiation.

03:50.540 --> 03:53.509
Man, I bet Hank is sorry he
stayed behind in Wakanda now.

03:53.510 --> 03:54.527
No kidding.

03:54.528 --> 03:57.562
This is way cooler
than studying vibranium.

03:57.563 --> 03:59.929
Uh, no offense.

03:59.979 --> 04:03.375
Where is Bruce Banner?
I was told he was on your team.

04:03.805 --> 04:06.906
- Why does that man have green hair?
- I have no idea.

04:06.907 --> 04:09.011
You're Dr. Leonard Samson, right?

04:09.012 --> 04:11.888
Hulk is on a vacation.

04:13.159 --> 04:15.665
Now, does some one to
tell us what's going on.

04:18.307 --> 04:23.125
This is video from SHIELD's
incursion into the Cube, after the breakout.

04:25.589 --> 04:29.049
The staff and SHIELD personnel
were all accounted for,

04:29.446 --> 04:31.055
but the prisoners,

04:31.356 --> 04:33.207
now, they were another matter.

04:37.835 --> 04:39.326
What was that?

04:40.455 --> 04:41.833
Emil Blonsky,

04:41.834 --> 04:45.503
the Abomination, strong
as the Hulk, twice as mean,

04:45.911 --> 04:47.886
and with military training.

04:48.043 --> 04:50.154
He's not the problem, though.

04:51.071 --> 04:54.332
The energy dome
exploded outward from the Cube

04:54.333 --> 04:57.206
and the SHIELD was caught inside it.

04:57.415 --> 04:59.025
And then this happened.

05:10.358 --> 05:13.647
The dome is expanding
with no sign of stopping.

05:13.648 --> 05:16.970
At this rate, it will hit a
town in the next six hours.

05:16.971 --> 05:18.570
A major city in eight.

05:18.571 --> 05:20.648
Who is responsible for this?

05:21.610 --> 05:25.746
Samuel Sterns, the Leader,
a gamma irradiated villain,

05:25.747 --> 05:29.571
as strong as the Hulk is,
the Leader is intelligent.

05:29.572 --> 05:32.329
As far as we know, the Leader's inside,

05:32.330 --> 05:35.025
most likely with a
mess of gamma villains.

05:35.026 --> 05:38.801
The Abomination, the
Absorbing Man, Zzzax.

05:38.977 --> 05:42.281
They were all inside the Cube
when the breakout occurred.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.414
We want you to go into the Cube.

05:47.508 --> 05:49.346
Oh, wait, you're serious.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.153
Got you.

06:27.358 --> 06:28.373
What?

06:41.438 --> 06:44.340
Sorry, buddy, I didn't
know the secret knock.

06:58.498 --> 06:59.827
Let's do this.

07:10.266 --> 07:12.678
Not to harp on this
one particular little point,

07:12.679 --> 07:15.792
but how are gonna get into
the Cube without, you know,

07:15.793 --> 07:17.549
getting all gamma-ed up?

07:17.550 --> 07:19.377
This is how, Wasp.

07:24.239 --> 07:27.567
I've modified this SHIELD
radiation plating to protect you.

07:27.568 --> 07:31.812
Wearing these, you should be immune
to the effects of the Gamma Dome.

07:34.776 --> 07:37.769
An Asgardian needs no such protection.

07:39.836 --> 07:45.447
- So you've sent people in wearing these?
- Uh, no, it hasn't been tested yet.

07:46.545 --> 07:48.803
But I'm confident it will work.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.214
So who wants to go first? Panther?

08:28.552 --> 08:29.910
Leaders lead.

08:30.153 --> 08:31.446
Thanks, Cap.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.600
Iron-Man to SHIELD base camp, respond.

09:00.732 --> 09:03.154
Ugh, communications are down.

09:04.982 --> 09:07.375
SHIELD's down, too. I've got nothing.

09:15.089 --> 09:17.344
Man, look at this place.

09:40.796 --> 09:41.755
Quartermain?

09:41.756 --> 09:43.960
It's them. It's my men.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.828
- I kind of missing chasing Hawkeye.
- You and me both.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.010
Wasp!

11:27.828 --> 11:31.526
Hmm, these creatures
may share his origin,

11:31.527 --> 11:34.433
but they are pale
reflections of the true Hulk.

11:34.434 --> 11:36.069
That's a good thing, Thor.

11:39.041 --> 11:41.338
Once these agents are
clear of the gamma field,

11:41.339 --> 11:43.593
they should revert back to human form,

11:43.594 --> 11:45.686
hopefully with no side effects.

11:45.687 --> 11:48.016
You had some pretty good
moves back there, Doc.

11:48.017 --> 11:51.255
Doc Samson, Avenger. Think about it.

11:52.248 --> 11:55.089
Look around, this is all my fault.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.449
Bruce warned me and I didn't listen.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.773
My only concern right
now is making this right.

12:00.774 --> 12:03.524
The dome has to have
some kind of power source

12:03.525 --> 12:04.756
like a gamma generator.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.708
If the Leader truly is as
brilliant as Samson says,

12:07.709 --> 12:09.208
then this is no doubt a trap.

12:09.209 --> 12:11.493
He would be prepared for
SHIELD at the very least,

12:11.494 --> 12:13.033
and the Hulk at the very most.

12:13.710 --> 12:15.195
I forgot you talked.

12:15.196 --> 12:19.061
If this is a trap,
warriors, then so be it.

12:20.212 --> 12:23.139
Okay, Thor goes in first.

12:24.872 --> 12:28.856
Do you have it, the
blood of the incredible Hulk

12:28.857 --> 12:30.977
as Barron Strucker requested?

12:30.978 --> 12:32.458
Hail HYDRA.

12:32.459 --> 12:34.310
You've earned your money, Widow.

12:34.311 --> 12:37.737
I know Strucker was hesitant
to trust you, but this...

12:40.339 --> 12:41.949
<i>What's happening down there?</i>

13:02.764 --> 13:04.079
Who's next?

13:10.254 --> 13:11.821
Helecarrier, I repeat.

13:11.822 --> 13:15.074
The Avengers have entered the Cube,
but we lost radio contact.

13:15.075 --> 13:18.323
It's not interference. The
signal is being blocked.

13:22.355 --> 13:23.933
Stay sharp, team.

13:24.298 --> 13:25.920
Right. Everyone stay sharp.

13:28.553 --> 13:31.294
Jackson? Jackson, what just happened?

13:33.569 --> 13:34.772
Vaughn!

13:34.784 --> 13:37.038
The gamma radiation is
messing with my systems.

13:37.039 --> 13:39.637
I've got multiple contacts,
but I can't lock them down.

13:39.638 --> 13:42.871
If anyone is completely terrified,
I can escort you out.

13:45.469 --> 13:46.392
Doc?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.336
Show yourself, coward.

13:49.433 --> 13:50.918
The U-Foes.

13:58.081 --> 14:00.432
Give Vapor a kiss.

14:08.762 --> 14:11.889
- Welcome to the Cube.
- Vector.

14:11.929 --> 14:16.798
That's... I created those
devices to drain gamma energy.

14:16.799 --> 14:19.547
The Leader has other plans for them.

14:19.548 --> 14:22.784
Our powers are increased
to level you can't...

14:24.981 --> 14:26.969
You all talk too much.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.292
Truly a poor showing.

14:44.293 --> 14:45.922
The Leader will have to do much better.

14:45.923 --> 14:46.770
No.

14:46.771 --> 14:50.885
The agents outside, the U-Foes,
it is all a distraction.

15:00.963 --> 15:03.038
Attack me, monster.

15:14.577 --> 15:19.592
You don't get it, do you?
We don't need to beat you.

15:19.671 --> 15:21.415
Oh, no, the gamma armor.

15:49.362 --> 15:52.645
Poor misguided Dr. Samson.

15:53.013 --> 15:56.356
All that time you were
studying me in the Cube,

15:56.357 --> 16:00.985
you didn't realize
it was I studying you.

16:01.318 --> 16:02.490
How sad.

16:03.414 --> 16:07.380
Wasp, put the good
doctor out of his misery.

16:10.254 --> 16:12.786
I have no desire to fight you, Wasp.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.850
Remember who you are.

16:29.252 --> 16:30.599
This doesn't look good.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.963
- Thoughts?
- We can't hurt these men.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.710
I'm pretty sure they don't
feel the same way about us.

16:36.711 --> 16:38.165
Panther, you take Quartermain,

16:38.166 --> 16:39.525
Cap and I will...

16:40.256 --> 16:42.317
Panther? Panther!

16:42.338 --> 16:43.497
I can't believe this.

16:43.498 --> 16:44.542
Heads up.

16:56.507 --> 16:57.939
There's too many of them.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.422
We can't give up.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.808
All they have to do
is take out our armor.

17:02.809 --> 17:04.468
We have to go for the generator.

17:04.469 --> 17:07.040
Samson, go. I'll cover you.

17:11.713 --> 17:13.164
Thor, we have to go.

17:13.184 --> 17:14.952
The Leader will pay for this.

17:26.288 --> 17:28.714
You should have let go, Clint.

17:28.766 --> 17:32.527
So shoot. Come on, Natasha, do it.

17:32.528 --> 17:34.418
Come on, you HYDRA scum.

18:08.954 --> 18:09.984
No.

18:10.787 --> 18:12.290
It's over, Natasha.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.504
You lost.

18:13.505 --> 18:15.009
Let me go, Hawkeye.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.046
You can't take me to SHIELD.
You're a traitor remember?

18:18.047 --> 18:19.994
Yeah, I remember.

18:19.995 --> 18:22.606
That's why I'm not taking you to SHIELD.

18:23.349 --> 18:25.881
I'm taking you to the Avengers.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.872
Protect Samson. I'll get Tony.

18:55.785 --> 19:00.798
Thor, destroy the
generator no matter what!

19:01.165 --> 19:03.892
Doctor, Iron-Man speaks truly.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.174
Find me the Leader,
and I will finish this.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.513
Uh-oh.

19:16.130 --> 19:19.751
Oh, look, Wrecker, they actually thought
the Leader was gonna be here.

19:19.752 --> 19:20.753
Too bad.

19:35.268 --> 19:37.286
Let's take them down, boys.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.950
Doctor!

19:44.014 --> 19:45.272
I'm, I'm okay.

19:46.370 --> 19:47.779
Not changing.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.373
Not so easy this time, is it?

19:59.374 --> 20:01.840
Now, that we've got the power.

20:44.422 --> 20:48.644
I could not get close enough to the generator
while the Leader's forces guarded it.

20:48.689 --> 20:51.254
Are you okay, Doctor, Thunderer?

20:51.255 --> 20:55.093
Aye, T'Challa. But truly,
that was a close one.

21:16.378 --> 21:20.109
Everyone seems to be recovering
with no residual radiation poisoning.

21:20.110 --> 21:23.318
The energy the Leader
used was very specific.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.846
The Leader, there was no sign of him?

21:25.847 --> 21:28.729
No, but we saved a lot of lives today.

21:28.730 --> 21:31.032
And we foiled his big plan.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.096
Did we?

21:49.516 --> 21:52.851
I would call that little
test run a success.

21:53.090 --> 21:54.383
And now

21:55.480 --> 21:57.187
...we begin.

22:51.841 --> 22:54.442
That's what, nine gamma
villains back in custody?

22:54.443 --> 22:56.805
Pretty good day, right?

23:04.999 --> 23:08.279
The Avengers won't trust
you any more than SHIELD did.

23:08.666 --> 23:11.508
Heh. Good thing I've got
the Hulk blood you st...

23:11.698 --> 23:13.327
What the heck is that?

23:13.544 --> 23:15.042
Turn around, Hawkeye.

23:15.043 --> 23:16.797
Turn around right now!

23:23.714 --> 23:24.916
Go. Go!

23:57.368 --> 23:58.872
How is this possible?

23:58.873 --> 24:00.481
The Leader's machine was destroyed...

24:04.886 --> 24:06.001
Samson!

24:17.006 --> 24:20.381
Avengers, remember who you are.

24:36.399 --> 24:38.833
Anyone get the number
of that... Widow!

24:56.691 --> 24:58.676
Attention, humanity.

24:59.005 --> 25:02.207
That's... that's a
restricted SHIELD frequency.

25:02.208 --> 25:04.350
But that's no SHIELD agent.

25:10.140 --> 25:12.020
I come to you with a message.

25:12.021 --> 25:13.721
And that message is...

25:13.722 --> 25:15.690
"Do not be scared."

25:15.691 --> 25:20.077
The Gamma Dome that has formed
in the American southwest is no threat.

25:20.078 --> 25:21.989
It is a promise.

25:22.054 --> 25:27.462
It is going to change
the world for the better.

25:29.373 --> 25:30.748
You are weak.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.998
You suffer with your small
minds and fragile bodies.

25:34.999 --> 25:40.516
And you have plunged the world
into darkness with your faults.

25:40.517 --> 25:42.797
But I am here to save you.

25:42.798 --> 25:45.860
<i>I will remake the world in my image.</i>

25:46.600 --> 25:49.455
<i>I will remake you in my image.</i>

25:49.456 --> 25:53.335
<i>You will be perfect, like me.</i>

25:53.468 --> 25:57.305
<i>And I will think your thoughts for you.</i>

25:57.982 --> 26:01.147
<i>The Gamma energy will
grow to envelop the earth</i>

26:01.148 --> 26:03.548
<i>and you will be transformed.</i>

26:03.549 --> 26:06.924
<i>Your power will be my power.</i>

26:07.199 --> 26:09.046
<i>Accept your future,</i>

26:09.047 --> 26:11.941
<i>for I am your Leader.</i>

26:12.056 --> 26:15.329
Welcome to Gamma World.

26:22.088 --> 26:23.886
You're part of this, aren't you?

26:24.408 --> 26:25.732
Don't be stupid.

26:25.733 --> 26:29.918
Hydra has as much to lose as anyone
if that maniac takes over the world.

26:30.378 --> 26:33.394
Clint, the Avengers
were inside that dome.

26:33.395 --> 26:36.258
They're gone. What now?

26:37.793 --> 26:40.492
Not all of the Avengers were inside.

26:42.325 --> 26:44.246
We have to find the Hulk.

26:49.833 --> 26:51.744
Where do you think you're going?

26:51.745 --> 26:54.880
Bruce Banner is the foremost
expert on Gamma Energy.

26:54.881 --> 26:57.670
He and the Hulk have had
run-ins with the Leader before.

26:57.671 --> 26:59.100
He'll know how to stop this.

26:59.101 --> 27:00.960
We don't have much time, then.

27:00.961 --> 27:03.438
The Hulk was spotted in
Northern Canada this morning.

27:03.439 --> 27:05.683
There's a Hulkbuster
operation about to commence.

27:05.684 --> 27:08.622
- We can...
- What do you mean "we," traitor?

27:09.489 --> 27:11.379
Come back here!

27:12.528 --> 27:14.395
You can't leave me like this!

27:14.396 --> 27:15.944
Look on the bright
side, Widow...

27:15.945 --> 27:18.684
your new green skin
will match your eyes.

27:21.359 --> 27:23.656
Hawkeye!

27:23.657 --> 27:25.066
Hawkeye!

27:29.448 --> 27:31.025
Bring them to me.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.177
Leave me.

27:41.317 --> 27:43.162
My hammer...
where...

27:43.163 --> 27:46.866
Ah, yes. It is quite curious.

27:47.021 --> 27:48.968
My Wrecking Crew could
not lift your weapon,

27:48.969 --> 27:51.994
even with their strength
enhanced by my gamma boosters.

27:51.995 --> 27:56.702
And you of all the Avengers were not
affected by my gamma energy.

27:56.703 --> 27:58.974
Now tell me, why is that?

27:59.362 --> 28:03.764
Only those worthy of the thunder
may wield Mjolnir, villain.

28:03.765 --> 28:06.299
And as for your "energy,"

28:06.300 --> 28:09.956
mortal science holds no
fear for an Asgardian.

28:09.957 --> 28:13.480
I suppose if gamma energy has
no effect on a thunder god,

28:13.481 --> 28:17.253
then you will simply have
to serve as entertainment.

28:20.721 --> 28:22.539
Come to me, Mjolnir...

28:28.308 --> 28:29.710
Not scared?

28:29.711 --> 28:31.622
You will be.

29:12.485 --> 29:15.102
Let General Ross
know the Hulk is down.

29:15.103 --> 29:16.822
The Hulk is down.

29:32.528 --> 29:34.239
Hulkbuster unit to Ross...

29:34.240 --> 29:36.761
...we're taking fire from
an unidentified bogey!

29:36.762 --> 29:39.676
We are bingo fuel and have to set down!

30:08.991 --> 30:10.960
Fall back! Go! Go!

30:13.491 --> 30:15.465
Leave Hulk alone.

30:15.466 --> 30:18.943
Leave you alone?
I just saved your green hide.

30:18.944 --> 30:22.797
And now you get to return the favor.
I need some help.

30:23.018 --> 30:25.099
Call the Avengers.

30:26.153 --> 30:28.955
The Avengers are the
ones I'm trying to save,

30:28.956 --> 30:31.182
not to mention the whole world.

30:31.350 --> 30:33.144
There's a big green energy dome,

30:33.145 --> 30:35.556
turning everyone into gamma monsters.

30:35.557 --> 30:37.565
You want someone to fight monsters?

30:37.566 --> 30:38.995
You should've asked them.

30:38.996 --> 30:42.254
I don't need them, smart guy,
and I don't need you.

30:42.255 --> 30:43.910
I need Banner.

30:44.399 --> 30:46.196
Banner's not home.

30:46.197 --> 30:49.786
Now leave me alone!

30:49.787 --> 30:51.234
Listen, Bigfoot!

30:51.235 --> 30:55.716
If you don't give me Bruce Banner
in the next three seconds, bottom line?

30:55.717 --> 30:58.029
I will take you down.

31:08.566 --> 31:11.616
Okay. You have to give me a minute.

31:11.733 --> 31:13.841
He hasn't let me out in weeks.

31:14.458 --> 31:18.764
Now Agent Barton, tell
me everything you know.

31:20.014 --> 31:22.326
You call yourself Leader,

31:22.327 --> 31:25.523
but what gives you the
right to lead this world?

31:25.524 --> 31:28.271
You defeat your enemies with trickery,

31:28.272 --> 31:30.383
with the strength of others.

31:30.384 --> 31:32.548
You have no honor.

31:32.549 --> 31:34.182
You wish me to talk?

31:34.183 --> 31:35.255
Fine.

31:35.815 --> 31:37.969
Why should I lead humanity?

31:37.970 --> 31:42.921
I am the most advanced mind
the world has ever seen.

31:42.922 --> 31:48.737
I think on a level normal human beings
cannot begin to comprehend.

31:48.738 --> 31:52.297
Look at this world, Asgardian.

31:52.298 --> 31:56.642
Mankind is on the brink of destruction.

31:56.643 --> 31:58.962
They need me.

32:08.322 --> 32:09.433
Oh!

32:13.040 --> 32:17.352
Ay... gah!

32:20.674 --> 32:21.814
Ah!

32:32.425 --> 32:35.832
Wow. You did all this
while you were on the run?

32:36.439 --> 32:39.075
Yes, and don't touch anything.

32:39.169 --> 32:40.983
Your skycycle collected
quite a bit of data

32:40.984 --> 32:43.231
about the gamma energy
the dome was putting off.

32:43.232 --> 32:45.105
SHIELD likes to be thorough.

32:45.106 --> 32:46.500
Ow! Hey!

32:46.501 --> 32:47.880
What'd you do that for?

32:47.881 --> 32:49.458
I just inoculated you.

32:49.459 --> 32:52.387
That will temporarily protect you
from the Leader's gamma energy.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.542
We're going to have to
do some of this en route.

32:54.543 --> 32:55.898
There's not much time.

32:55.899 --> 32:58.164
The longer people are
exposed to the energy,

32:58.165 --> 33:00.767
the more likely the changes
will become permanent.

33:00.768 --> 33:02.909
I've located the epicenter of the dome,

33:02.910 --> 33:05.938
that's where the Leader will be
with the Gamma Energy Generator.

33:05.939 --> 33:07.758
That's what we have to destroy.

33:07.759 --> 33:10.736
Well, you've just got all
the answers, don't you?

33:10.737 --> 33:12.457
So how are we going
to get to the Leader?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.195
The direct route.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.689
You cannot win, you must know that.

33:40.943 --> 33:43.194
I disagree, villain.

33:47.877 --> 33:50.725
I played your game long
enough to retrieve Mjolnir.

33:50.726 --> 33:53.101
And now your game is over!

33:53.896 --> 33:55.129
What manner of...

33:56.257 --> 33:59.945
You feeble-minded fool!

33:59.946 --> 34:03.332
Of course I wanted you
to retrieve your hammer.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.363
I let you do it.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.533
Nice hammer.

34:10.882 --> 34:15.634
Now let me show you why
they call me the Absorbing Man.

34:20.241 --> 34:23.813
You asked before what
gives me the right to rule?

34:24.338 --> 34:27.429
Because no one can stop me.

35:39.501 --> 35:45.016
And without the Avengers,
who is left to stand against me?

35:48.954 --> 35:50.999
You with the head, freeze!

35:54.573 --> 35:57.668
I knew you would
come eventually, my old enemy.

35:57.897 --> 36:01.919
But you of all people
must realize this is for the best.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.276
In Gamma World,
no one will hunt you.

36:05.277 --> 36:06.895
No one will try and cure you.

36:06.896 --> 36:08.456
You'll be a king.

36:08.457 --> 36:12.547
Everyone who hated you,
who attacked you, they will be you.

36:12.548 --> 36:16.038
Are you really going to try and stop me?

36:16.058 --> 36:17.783
No.

36:17.992 --> 36:20.112
Not stop you

36:20.572 --> 36:22.205
smash you!

36:23.760 --> 36:27.658
Disappointing, but not unexpected.

36:27.834 --> 36:29.153
Abomination.

36:33.855 --> 36:35.390
You ready, animal?

36:35.391 --> 36:38.118
With the Leader's tech,
I'm stronger than you.

36:38.119 --> 36:41.629
I'm smarter than you.
And I am going to beat you to

36:53.254 --> 36:56.624
You're either very brave
or very stupid, archer.

36:58.776 --> 37:00.635
You're vastly outnumbered.

37:00.636 --> 37:01.752
That's okay.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.966
I've got an arrow for each of you.

37:13.646 --> 37:16.467
What do you think
you are accomplishing?

37:16.847 --> 37:19.442
Your toys cannot hurt my creations.

37:19.443 --> 37:23.014
Yeah, I'm not a genius like you,
so I found one.

37:23.015 --> 37:25.159
And he made me some new arrows.

37:30.916 --> 37:34.364
His name is Bruce Banner.
Maybe you've heard of him?

37:34.365 --> 37:36.788
Indeed I have.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.471
Great...

37:57.049 --> 37:58.512
Fight back!

37:58.513 --> 38:02.382
I cannot, for I am concentrating.

38:06.234 --> 38:07.687
I can't move!

38:07.941 --> 38:09.624
What's going on?

38:09.707 --> 38:14.076
You were foolish to take on
the essence of Mjolnir, mortal.

38:14.441 --> 38:17.975
The hammer's power is
not yours to control,

38:17.976 --> 38:19.958
it is mine.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.016
My genius cannot be defeated!

38:35.017 --> 38:37.651
I've planned for every contingency!

38:37.652 --> 38:41.301
Too bad you're such a lousy
shot then, cucumber head.

39:32.693 --> 39:34.692
I'll always beat you, Hulk.

39:34.693 --> 39:36.024
Do you hear me?

39:36.025 --> 39:39.251
I'm better than you in every way!

39:39.252 --> 39:42.320
But I've got something you don't

39:42.321 --> 39:43.935
backup.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.813
We got incoming!

40:05.715 --> 40:07.849
The two of you
think you can defeat me?

40:07.850 --> 40:12.634
I have already calculated a thousand ways
to destroy you both.

40:20.102 --> 40:25.207
Destroy? You do not know
the meaning of the word, Leader.

40:26.362 --> 40:28.535
You really want to hurt the Leader?

40:28.536 --> 40:30.240
This is how.

40:37.688 --> 40:39.611
No!

41:11.891 --> 41:14.537
It would have been glorious.

41:15.214 --> 41:21.142
I was creating the perfect world
all in my image.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.524
That's the problem.

41:23.587 --> 41:25.357
You're ugly.

41:37.257 --> 41:40.200
Footage from your skycycle
confirms your story...

41:40.201 --> 41:42.386
the Widow is working for Hydra.

41:42.387 --> 41:46.433
I sent agents to her location,
but she was long gone.

41:46.490 --> 41:48.508
She's good, I'll give her that.

41:48.509 --> 41:49.949
You're cleared, Hawkeye.

41:49.950 --> 41:53.231
Your SHIELD special agent
status will be reinstated.

41:53.232 --> 41:55.844
You mean the same
SHIELD that locked me up?

41:55.845 --> 41:59.071
Yeah, no thanks. I'm going
after the Widow on my own.

41:59.072 --> 42:01.604
Here's another option...
join us.

42:01.605 --> 42:03.399
Join the Avengers.

42:04.402 --> 42:05.576
I don't think so.

42:05.577 --> 42:08.416
Look how easily the Leader
took you guys out.

42:08.417 --> 42:10.214
I'm better off on my own.

42:11.550 --> 42:14.799
And what of you? Will
you walk away as well?

42:14.800 --> 42:17.411
You are indeed a
noble warrior, Hulk...

42:17.412 --> 42:21.184
one who has saved the Avengers,
and now helped save the world.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.440
I would trust you with my life.

42:23.527 --> 42:25.056
Will you trust us?

42:26.317 --> 42:27.536
Uh...

42:27.537 --> 42:31.017
I'll stay if Cupid stays.

42:31.332 --> 42:32.960
You want to go, jade jaws?

42:32.961 --> 42:35.155
Right here and now? Let's do this!

42:35.156 --> 42:37.697
Okay. This is going to be fun.

42:54.416 --> 42:56.813
Hello, Mister Blonsky.
