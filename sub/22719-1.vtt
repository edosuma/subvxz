02:06.835 --> 02:08.746
Wait till they see these.

02:08.914 --> 02:12.385
If they like the others,
they'll be crazy about these.

02:12.595 --> 02:16.190
- Like to look at them?
- I'll see them at the show.

02:16.915 --> 02:22.990
This is the best day of my life. I have
my first exhibition and I have you.

02:23.635 --> 02:26.388
Cecile, will you marry me
when I'm a success?

02:26.595 --> 02:28.790
Let's give ourselves a little time.

02:45.075 --> 02:46.793
Cecile!

02:48.915 --> 02:52.544
- Aren't you interested in anything?
- Yes, in going someplace else.

02:52.755 --> 02:55.315
- Where?
- I don't know.

02:55.955 --> 02:59.311
- Alone?
- Yes, alone.

03:00.995 --> 03:04.067
- There. We're engaged.
- I don't want that.

03:04.275 --> 03:06.072
All right.

03:06.275 --> 03:08.505
Then we're engaged.

03:10.515 --> 03:13.348
It's going to be a small wedding,
but you may come.

03:13.555 --> 03:15.671
- Will I see you later?
- Yes.

03:15.835 --> 03:17.063
Where?

03:17.835 --> 03:19.553
I don't know.

04:29.595 --> 04:32.189
I'll be ready in three seconds.

04:32.395 --> 04:36.866
- Any zipping or buttoning to do?
- No thanks, darling. It's all done.

04:37.075 --> 04:41.466
- Are we calling for Yvette?
- She's no longer with us. It's Denise.

04:41.675 --> 04:44.587
- Model?
- Actress. Aspiring. Rather appetizing.

04:44.755 --> 04:46.188
Talented too, she says.

04:46.355 --> 04:49.233
- The usual trinket?
- Not this time. It's pretty, though.

04:49.435 --> 04:52.108
- Like to see it?
- I'll see it later...

04:52.435 --> 04:54.426
...on Denise.

05:20.235 --> 05:23.545
Jacques, there she is now. Cecile?

05:24.355 --> 05:26.994
- Hello.
- I'm so glad to see you.

05:27.195 --> 05:30.744
- I love your dress. Is it new?
- Thank you. You look adorable.

05:30.955 --> 05:34.994
- Raymond.
- And this is Denise... Denise.

05:35.155 --> 05:37.111
- How do you do?
- Good evening.

05:37.315 --> 05:39.783
Cecile, this is Jacques,
who's dying to meet you.

05:39.955 --> 05:41.070
- How are you?
- Fine.

05:41.235 --> 05:43.146
- Have a drink?
- I'd love one.

05:43.355 --> 05:47.234
- I've waited a long time to meet you.
- I'm very flattered.

06:24.595 --> 06:26.665
Now, I'm gonna sit here.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.833
Denise? You sit there.

06:30.035 --> 06:34.187
Deanne there. Paulette here. Cecile...
That's not gonna work.

06:34.355 --> 06:36.550
Let's dance in the meantime.

06:47.115 --> 06:51.552
- May I take you to the races tomorrow?
- I'd love to go. Thank you, Jacques.

06:56.115 --> 07:00.108
<i>After the races he'll tak e me
to dinner and dancing again.</i>

07:00.315 --> 07:02.988
<i>And on Thursday to
the tennis matches.</i>

07:03.155 --> 07:05.544
<i>And on Sunday to the country.</i>

07:05.755 --> 07:08.747
<i>What a waste of time, dear Jacques.</i>

07:08.915 --> 07:12.271
<i>What a hopeless waste of time.</i>

07:35.115 --> 07:38.027
<i>He's attractive. And he's nice.</i>

07:38.235 --> 07:40.430
<i>And I'd lik e to warn him...</i>

07:40.635 --> 07:42.990
<i>... but he wouldn't understand...</i>

07:43.195 --> 07:47.666
<i>... that I can't feel anything
he might be interested in...</i>

07:47.875 --> 07:51.185
<i>... because I'm surrounded by a wall.</i>

07:51.395 --> 07:56.185
<i>An invisible wall
made of memories I can't lose.</i>

09:16.195 --> 09:18.345
Hey, how about a dance?

09:18.555 --> 09:21.388
- Half a dance.
- Better than none.

09:22.515 --> 09:24.551
- He likes you.
- He's very charming.

09:24.755 --> 09:26.427
- How's Denise?
- Great girl.

09:26.635 --> 09:29.911
- This is gonna be a fun evening.
- Yes, wonderful.

09:30.755 --> 09:33.872
It's wonderful luck
having you for a daughter.

09:34.075 --> 09:36.953
The luck runs both ways, sir.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.704
<i>But even with my father
it isn't the same anymore.</i>

09:42.875 --> 09:44.752
<i>Nothing is.</i>

09:44.915 --> 09:46.871
<i>Will I ever be happy again...</i>

09:47.075 --> 09:51.273
<i>... as I was at the beginning of that
wonderful summer on the Riviera...</i>

09:51.435 --> 09:54.154
<i>... just a year ago?</i>

09:55.075 --> 09:57.066
<i>Seven was my magic number.</i>

09:57.235 --> 10:00.272
<i>I was very superstitious then,
and loved it.</i>

10:00.435 --> 10:01.948
<i>Seven and three.</i>

10:02.155 --> 10:05.192
<i>The seven came out of my age, 17.</i>

10:05.395 --> 10:10.469
<i>And the three from the three members
of our very happy household.</i>

10:11.075 --> 10:13.589
Good morning, Albertine.
My coffee, please.

10:13.795 --> 10:17.549
Albertine has the sunstroke.
I'm her sister, Léontine.

10:17.715 --> 10:21.390
So you are. Good morning, Léontine.
Is she very ill?

10:21.595 --> 10:23.551
- You know how it is.
- I know how it is.

10:23.755 --> 10:26.349
- Good morning, Alber...
- Albertine has the sunstroke.

10:26.515 --> 10:31.145
- This is her sister, Léontine.
- I thought I felt a change. Forgive me.

10:31.355 --> 10:35.792
My sister told me what to expect.
Good morning, monsieur.

10:35.955 --> 10:37.627
I don't think she approves.

10:37.795 --> 10:41.754
- They lack imagination down here.
- More likely they have too much.

10:41.955 --> 10:43.786
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

10:43.995 --> 10:46.350
Did you sleep well?
Did you wake well?

10:46.515 --> 10:49.871
I never do and you always do.
It's repulsively unfair.

10:50.075 --> 10:52.714
- Just you wait till you're my age.
- How's Elsa?

10:52.875 --> 10:55.264
She's asleep.
Look at that wonderful sea.

10:55.475 --> 10:58.831
- High time we threw ourselves in.
- All that vitality.

10:58.995 --> 11:00.587
Elsa?

11:03.635 --> 11:05.705
- Twice more.
- Why?

11:05.875 --> 11:07.149
Three times is good luck.

11:07.315 --> 11:09.112
- Pebbles and all?
- Of course.

11:09.315 --> 11:11.306
Elsa? Elsa?

11:11.475 --> 11:14.035
If you really want it to work,
do it seven times.

11:14.235 --> 11:17.068
If I want that,
I'll pull her out by the hair.

11:17.235 --> 11:18.668
Wait.

11:19.515 --> 11:21.551
Let's smell the day.

11:24.515 --> 11:25.868
Good morning, Cecile.

11:26.035 --> 11:27.946
Good morning, Raymond.

11:28.115 --> 11:29.946
I'm up now.

11:34.875 --> 11:37.867
Two letters for you.
One's from your office.

11:38.075 --> 11:40.270
Throw it away. It's vacation time.

11:40.475 --> 11:42.591
It doesn't say who this one's from.

11:42.755 --> 11:46.589
Look, not bad. Another week,
it'll be flatter than yours.

11:46.755 --> 11:48.905
But you're tempting the devil...

11:49.115 --> 11:52.187
...looking in the mirror before noon.

11:52.355 --> 11:54.664
Do I look that much fatter
in the morning?

11:54.875 --> 11:58.754
It has nothing to do with that.
It's bad luck, that's all.

11:58.955 --> 12:02.072
- Why?
- It just is. You'll see.

12:28.715 --> 12:29.909
Elsa?

12:30.075 --> 12:31.986
- I'm asleep.
- Then wake up.

12:32.195 --> 12:34.914
- It's the middle of the night.
- It's morning.

12:35.115 --> 12:36.867
- It's raining.
- No, it isn't.

12:37.075 --> 12:40.431
It is. Great big drops.
I heard them on the door.

12:40.595 --> 12:44.429
- How do you feel?
- As if I were swimming in sizzling oil.

12:44.635 --> 12:46.387
You do look like a lobster.

12:46.595 --> 12:48.950
You were too lazy
to move out of the sun.

12:49.155 --> 12:51.988
If you really adored me,
you would have moved the sun.

12:52.195 --> 12:54.345
I adore you, all right.

12:55.995 --> 12:58.668
- Good morning, Elsa.
- Good morning, Raymond.

12:58.835 --> 13:01.554
- Up.
- Don't make me move, I'll crack.

13:01.755 --> 13:04.588
- But you can't lie here all day.
- Why not?

13:04.795 --> 13:07.070
- Good morning, Elsa.
- Good morning.

13:07.275 --> 13:10.153
I wish you would explain
to your father...

13:10.355 --> 13:12.630
- Is that my new pin?
- Pretty, I think.

13:12.795 --> 13:14.023
Off with it.

13:14.195 --> 13:16.755
- I thought we were friends.
- So did I.

13:16.955 --> 13:21.585
But then you let him come in here
before I've washed my face.

13:21.795 --> 13:24.025
I am going to crack.

13:24.235 --> 13:28.751
Curiously, you look very appetizing.
Even with an unwashed face.

13:28.955 --> 13:31.344
Thank you, darling.

13:31.715 --> 13:33.068
I have cracked.

13:33.235 --> 13:36.705
- Where?
- Here. Now I'm getting peely.

13:36.915 --> 13:40.544
- I'll be ugly. You'll hate me.
- I can't stand that moaning.

13:40.755 --> 13:43.223
- Where are you going?
- To sleep in the sea.

13:43.395 --> 13:47.274
- You sleep there, I'll sleep here.
- You can't go back to sleep.

13:47.435 --> 13:51.508
- Raymond, no.
- You be careful. She is sunburned.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.752
Raymond!

14:12.315 --> 14:16.069
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10...

14:16.275 --> 14:19.392
...96, 97, 98, 99, 100.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.954
Now, the rain from heaven,
if you please.

14:23.235 --> 14:26.625
None left.
You'll have to go in yourself.

14:26.835 --> 14:30.714
Marvellous, Raymond.
It's like swimming in cool velvet.

14:30.915 --> 14:34.066
- Velvet's always hot.
- Cool silk, then.

14:34.275 --> 14:37.904
- Know where I'd like to be this minute?
- Exactly where you are.

14:38.075 --> 14:40.191
You're exactly right.

14:40.355 --> 14:43.392
Hey, out of my way.
There's work to be done.

14:43.955 --> 14:48.506
Look. The lobster lady approaches.

14:48.995 --> 14:51.190
Guess who?

14:53.315 --> 14:56.432
- Marvellous. She really is a good sport.
- She is.

14:56.635 --> 14:58.865
- I'm glad you like her.
- It's easy.

14:59.075 --> 15:01.635
She's fun and she's unpretentious.

15:01.795 --> 15:04.355
I'm glad you scuttled Yvonne Marie
before summer.

15:04.515 --> 15:06.551
I wouldn't have brought her here.

15:06.755 --> 15:09.064
If you'd met her in April,
you would've.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.664
That's why I met her in November.

15:11.875 --> 15:15.629
I would kiss you for the umbrella,
Raymond, but you are in the sun.

15:15.835 --> 15:19.111
- I mixed three lotions in one jar, Elsa.
- Brilliant.

15:19.315 --> 15:21.624
I don't guarantee
they'll stop the peeling.

15:21.795 --> 15:25.788
I'm in no condition
to ask for a guarantee on anything.

15:25.995 --> 15:28.987
All the way down here
I've been brain-rattling.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.106
- Seriously?
- Yes.

15:31.315 --> 15:36.105
Cecile, which would you rather have,
jewels or furs?

15:36.275 --> 15:37.503
Neither.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.348
Jewellery's supposed to be
a good investment.

15:40.555 --> 15:43.115
And of course, you can wear it
all year round.

15:43.315 --> 15:45.749
But furs feel so good under bare feet.

15:45.955 --> 15:48.185
Are you planning another birthday?

15:48.355 --> 15:51.347
No. And I'm not being hinty either.

15:51.555 --> 15:53.307
I was just wondering.

15:53.515 --> 15:56.473
You see, when we go
to the casino Friday night...

15:56.675 --> 16:00.668
I look like a piece
of old wallpaper.

16:00.835 --> 16:05.033
And I win a lot of money again.
Where is my comb?

16:05.235 --> 16:08.033
There might be one
in the pocket of this shirt.

16:08.195 --> 16:11.028
After all, I won quite a bit
last Friday.

16:11.235 --> 16:13.988
And if I win quite a bit this Friday...
Thank you.

16:14.195 --> 16:16.151
You still haven't opened your letter.

16:16.355 --> 16:20.064
I was wondering what I ought
to give myself for a present.

16:20.235 --> 16:21.953
What happens if you lose?

16:22.115 --> 16:26.666
But I never lose, Raymond.
You know that. I can't.

16:26.875 --> 16:32.029
That horoscope Cecile got for me
says I was born lucky and...

16:32.755 --> 16:35.269
Where is she going?

16:41.555 --> 16:44.149
- Will he drown?
- No, of course not, darling.

16:44.355 --> 16:48.507
- What makes you think it's a "he"?
- Why else would she run?

16:53.195 --> 16:56.153
- You all right?
- I'm fine, thanks.

16:56.355 --> 16:58.471
- My, but you're polite.
- I'm sorry.

16:58.675 --> 17:00.028
Need some help?

17:00.235 --> 17:04.022
- May I tie her onto your float?
- Sure. I'll help.

17:04.194 --> 17:07.550
My mother has a house on
the other side of the rocks.

17:07.755 --> 17:10.109
I'm spending my vacation there.

17:11.075 --> 17:13.748
- Vacation from what?
- Law school.

17:15.474 --> 17:19.309
- Do you really mean to be a lawyer?
- Why else go to law school?

17:19.515 --> 17:23.554
Well, one has to do something
until one reaches a certain age.

17:23.714 --> 17:26.707
- One has to prepare for the future.
- I'm preparing.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.873
- How?
- By learning how to have a good time.

17:30.035 --> 17:31.150
That's not a very...

17:31.355 --> 17:35.871
- You're terribly serious, aren't you?
- Yes, I am serious.

17:36.035 --> 17:38.026
- How marvellous.
- Why?

17:38.235 --> 17:41.511
- I don't know any serious people.
- How peculiar.

17:41.715 --> 17:44.627
That's my father there
with a friend of ours.

17:44.835 --> 17:47.144
- Yes, I know.
- You do? How?

17:47.355 --> 17:50.267
- You've seen us at the casino.
- No.

17:50.435 --> 17:53.233
No, you're too serious to go there.
In the village?

17:53.435 --> 17:56.871
- I've never seen any of you.
- Then you've heard about us.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.503
You heard about those
wicked people from Paris.

17:59.675 --> 18:02.428
- I'm from Paris.
- You heard and were intrigued.

18:02.595 --> 18:03.948
You're corruptible.

18:04.155 --> 18:06.749
I'm just interested in people,
that's all.

18:06.915 --> 18:09.475
Well, it was very nice
of you to help me.

18:09.675 --> 18:12.394
- I didn't mean to embarrass you.
- You didn't.

18:12.595 --> 18:14.233
Or shock you.

18:14.395 --> 18:17.865
- lf you'd like to come sailing...
- I'd love it, but I don't know how.

18:18.035 --> 18:19.309
I'll teach you.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.670
I think you could do with
a lesson yourself.

18:21.835 --> 18:24.110
I'm an excellent sailor.
The mast broke.

18:24.275 --> 18:25.503
- Come on.
- Where?

18:25.715 --> 18:28.707
Don't you want to meet
the wicked people from Paris?

18:35.395 --> 18:37.147
Do you think I upset him?

18:37.355 --> 18:40.586
You hop subjects like a roulette ball.
Upset who?

18:40.795 --> 18:43.992
- That sailor boat boy. What's his name?
- Philippe.

18:44.195 --> 18:48.347
It's torture to wear clothes
with a sunburn.

18:48.515 --> 18:52.474
I think I did upset him.
Was I too open about us?

18:52.675 --> 18:56.031
He didn't need quite so much help
in adding one and one.

18:56.195 --> 18:58.470
Anyway, he's brilliantly cute.

18:58.675 --> 19:02.463
- Why didn't Cecile ask him to dinner?
- She did for tomorrow.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.667
- I would have asked for tonight.
- I'm sure.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.672
Why waste time?

19:07.875 --> 19:10.469
This was found in the pocket
of your shirt.

19:10.635 --> 19:11.704
Thank you.

19:11.915 --> 19:15.703
- Could I have more coffee, please?
- Yes, mademoiselle.

19:16.075 --> 19:20.034
She thinks she's being insulting
with that "mademoiselle."

19:20.195 --> 19:25.349
I love it. I'm not old enough
to be madame, am I? Cecile?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.386
I'm listening to the crickets.

19:27.555 --> 19:30.627
But they only say the same thing
over and over.

19:30.835 --> 19:34.111
I read they make that noise
by rubbing their legs together.

19:34.275 --> 19:35.867
What a thought.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.430
I have a surprise.
Company is coming.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.547
- Brilliant. Anybody I know?
- Anne Larsen.

19:41.755 --> 19:43.507
This dress is her design.

19:43.715 --> 19:45.626
- Coming here? When?
- Next week.

19:45.835 --> 19:49.191
- Raymond, is Anne Larsen married?
- She's divorced. Why?

19:49.395 --> 19:51.670
- How old is she?
- She's older than you are.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.389
She was my mother's best friend.

19:54.595 --> 19:56.790
She must be a very lovely lady.

19:56.995 --> 20:00.874
- Your thoughts are so hard to follow.
- Be careful of my back.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.192
I just have to get out of this dress.

20:07.635 --> 20:10.752
Your crickets are having
a cocktail party.

20:10.915 --> 20:13.304
- Raymond.
- Now please, don't bawl me out.

20:13.515 --> 20:15.392
- May I ask a question?
- No.

20:15.555 --> 20:18.194
- What made you invite Anne?
- You like Anne.

20:18.395 --> 20:22.627
I do. Very much.
But we hardly ever see her anymore.

20:22.835 --> 20:25.986
- I see her all the time.
- Occasionally. At large parties.

20:26.195 --> 20:30.393
Last time we had a long chat at
a comparatively small cocktail party.

20:30.555 --> 20:31.783
What?

20:31.955 --> 20:34.913
I know you and the invitations
you hand out at parties.

20:35.075 --> 20:38.431
- To be honest, I forgot I'd invited her.
- You're awful.

20:38.595 --> 20:40.665
How did you happen
to ask her anyway?

20:40.835 --> 20:42.791
She looked particularly attractive.

20:42.955 --> 20:45.628
She's always seemed
so aloof and self-assured.

20:45.795 --> 20:50.425
I wouldn't think she would vacation
here. How did you get her to accept?

20:50.595 --> 20:53.792
- No one's told you I'm charming?
- Everyone but Anne.

20:53.955 --> 20:55.308
You should ask her now.

20:55.475 --> 20:59.263
I reminded her she's practically
your godmother and hasn't seen you.

20:59.475 --> 21:03.548
I can hear it all:
"Anne, Cecile is no longer a child.

21:03.795 --> 21:05.308
She's a young girl now.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.508
I try to be both parents to her,
but she needs the help of a woman.

21:09.675 --> 21:10.903
The women I know..."

21:11.075 --> 21:14.750
That's marvellous.
I should be taking lessons from you.

21:14.915 --> 21:18.191
Raymond?
Did you tell her about Elsa?

21:18.395 --> 21:20.625
- Elsa?
- Oh, Raymond.

21:20.835 --> 21:23.952
I don't think I knew that Elsa
was coming when I asked Anne.

21:24.115 --> 21:27.027
Anne said she'd think it over and...
Oh, dear.

21:27.235 --> 21:30.307
Raymond?
Which room is Anne going to have?

21:30.475 --> 21:32.943
I thought I'd give her mine.

21:34.155 --> 21:36.544
- I'll sleep in the bathhouse.
- I will.

21:36.755 --> 21:41.271
- The ladies here, the gentleman there.
- You're worried about appearances?

21:41.475 --> 21:45.673
- I'm a bundle of surprises tonight.
- You're impossible. So is the situation.

21:45.875 --> 21:47.831
She's arriving on Monday.

21:48.035 --> 21:50.947
So you can either spank me,
walk out or help me.

21:51.155 --> 21:54.591
- You know I'll help you.
- I suspected you might.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.473
You're such a fake.

21:56.675 --> 22:00.224
It's such wonderful fun
to have you for a daughter.

22:03.115 --> 22:05.504
Hey, what's the matter?

22:05.715 --> 22:08.752
I don't want it to stop. Ever.

22:08.955 --> 22:11.913
<i>But suddenly somehow
I knew it would stop.</i>

22:12.115 --> 22:14.754
<i>That our happy days were numbered.</i>

22:35.275 --> 22:38.790
<i>That was a Tuesday.
Anne was due the following Monday.</i>

22:38.955 --> 22:40.468
<i>Six more days.</i>

22:40.675 --> 22:43.792
<i>I remember thinking
seven would have been lucky.</i>

22:43.995 --> 22:46.668
<i>It was very hot
the day Anne was to arrive.</i>

22:46.835 --> 22:50.748
<i>My father and Elsa
went to meet her at the station.</i>

22:57.235 --> 22:58.748
They're back.

23:15.435 --> 23:17.027
Anne!

23:18.355 --> 23:19.993
Welcome.

23:20.635 --> 23:22.865
Thank you, Cecile.

23:26.435 --> 23:28.869
Are you that grown up?

23:29.075 --> 23:32.590
- Really, welcome.
- And really, thank you.

23:34.475 --> 23:38.593
- Which way?
- Terrace first, so you can see the view.

23:40.395 --> 23:43.273
- How did your new collection go?
- Extremely well.

23:43.435 --> 23:47.633
But I wish I could have found
material the colour of this water.

23:47.835 --> 23:51.191
I spent my honeymoon by the sea.
Twelve years ago.

23:51.395 --> 23:54.467
Did you like it? I mean the place?

23:54.675 --> 23:57.394
Yes, I liked both it and the place.

23:57.595 --> 24:00.553
Although it wasn't nearly
as lovely as this.

24:00.715 --> 24:04.071
I had quite a debate with myself
before coming here.

24:04.275 --> 24:07.904
- I'm delighted I lost.
- I'll fetch your things.

24:09.835 --> 24:12.827
- What's the matter, Cecile?
- Nothing. Why?

24:13.035 --> 24:15.469
- You're embarrassed.
- There's nothing.

24:15.675 --> 24:17.028
May I guess?

24:17.195 --> 24:21.074
You're annoyed Raymond isn't here
to spread a welcome carpet.

24:21.275 --> 24:25.154
He's spreading it with flowers.
He's spreading it at the station.

24:25.355 --> 24:27.073
But I wired I was driving.

24:27.275 --> 24:28.549
- You wired?
- Yes.

24:28.755 --> 24:31.394
I wouldn't decide to drive
and not send word.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.347
Where do you suppose
that telegram is?

24:33.515 --> 24:35.870
In his pocket, unopened.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.714
Albertine! I mean, Léontine!

24:38.915 --> 24:42.988
Slight maid problem.
Weird sisters rotate working for us.

24:43.195 --> 24:44.867
Weird? How?

24:45.035 --> 24:49.745
Every week one or the other is stricken
with some odd malady. Maybe it's us.

24:49.955 --> 24:51.274
- Yes?
- Léontine...

24:51.435 --> 24:55.144
Léontine has a bad liver.
I am her sister, Claudine.

24:55.355 --> 24:59.906
- Did a telegram come today?
- I handed it to monsieur myself.

25:00.115 --> 25:03.585
- Didn't he read it?
- Do you know him, madame?

25:03.755 --> 25:08.545
- Would you take my bags to my room?
- Yes, madame.

25:09.795 --> 25:11.751
- Where is my room?
- This way.

25:11.955 --> 25:15.789
Poor Raymond. For once he's a victim
of his irresponsibility.

25:15.995 --> 25:18.873
- Serves him right.
- No, not on such a hot day.

25:19.075 --> 25:21.748
How I'd love
to resist opening telegrams.

25:21.955 --> 25:25.868
To not answer phones. To do exactly
what I intend to do here.

25:26.075 --> 25:28.543
- What?
- Nothing.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.672
Oh, what a lovely room.

25:31.875 --> 25:34.912
Raymond picked the flowers
and cut them himself.

25:35.115 --> 25:37.948
And even arranged them himself.
Isn't he sweet?

25:38.155 --> 25:41.670
He can be very endearing, can't he?

25:42.715 --> 25:46.310
At least the weird sisters clean well.

25:47.315 --> 25:51.103
You're looking wonderfully well.
I'm surprised and pleased.

25:51.275 --> 25:54.312
- Why surprised?
- From Raymond's description...

25:54.515 --> 25:58.144
That was in Paris.
I was worn out from studying.

25:58.315 --> 26:01.944
- How did you do with examinations?
- Flunked.

26:02.955 --> 26:05.344
- Flunked?
- Flunked.

26:07.955 --> 26:11.550
- Would you like me to unpack for you?
- No, thank you.

26:11.755 --> 26:14.792
- The box is for you.
- Oh, Anne.

26:16.155 --> 26:18.715
- Are you studying now?
- During vacation?

26:18.915 --> 26:21.634
You'll take examinations again
in October.

26:21.795 --> 26:23.865
Why? Raymond never got a diploma.

26:24.075 --> 26:27.112
Yes, but he worked hard.
Made quite a bit of money.

26:27.315 --> 26:31.103
If it's gone, I'm sure there'll always
be a man to take care of me.

26:31.315 --> 26:34.227
And you don't need a diploma
for that.

26:35.395 --> 26:40.344
I don't like vulgarities, Cecile.
Even when they're funny.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.193
I'm sorry.

26:42.395 --> 26:44.306
The dress is marvellous.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.824
- It's really marvellous.
- But?

26:46.995 --> 26:48.667
No, the style is too.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.309
Everything you design is perfect.

26:51.515 --> 26:55.144
But you think that's too young
for you? You're wrong.

26:55.355 --> 26:59.394
A more sophisticated style would
only make you look more of a child.

26:59.555 --> 27:01.113
I'm not a child.

27:01.315 --> 27:04.307
You're not going to make me study,
are you?

27:04.515 --> 27:06.551
I didn't know I could.

27:06.715 --> 27:08.512
Well, you could.

27:09.475 --> 27:13.548
Don't be so afraid of me.
I'm not here as your governess.

27:13.755 --> 27:15.746
I won't make you do anything.

27:15.955 --> 27:19.152
Although I might try
to influence you a little.

27:19.595 --> 27:22.951
Even a scale.
Well, that'll ruin my appetite.

27:23.155 --> 27:24.873
That's Raymond's.

27:25.075 --> 27:29.512
- Did he give up this room for me?
- I offered to move out of mine.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.707
It's odd a villa this size
has only two bedrooms.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.945
- There are three.
- Three?

27:35.155 --> 27:38.591
Yes, this one and two upstairs.
Mine and Elsa's.

27:38.755 --> 27:42.304
Elsa Mackenbourg.
I think you met her.

27:42.515 --> 27:45.075
Not too bright but a lot of fun.

27:45.835 --> 27:48.588
Just what does he think I am?

27:48.915 --> 27:51.065
He sleeps in the bathhouse.

27:51.435 --> 27:53.790
He can sleep here,
because I won't.

27:53.955 --> 27:57.265
Or any other place else that he...

27:57.875 --> 28:00.469
Cecile, would you mind
leaving me alone?

28:02.035 --> 28:03.514
No.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.113
Cecile?

28:09.675 --> 28:11.586
- Cecile?
- Yes, Raymond.

28:11.755 --> 28:15.065
She wasn't there. You suppose
she fell out of the train?

28:15.235 --> 28:17.226
- She's here. She drove.
- You see?

28:17.395 --> 28:19.784
I told you Philippe
didn't have an American car.

28:19.995 --> 28:23.624
Must have been
190 degrees in the shade.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.268
My pathetic feet.

28:25.435 --> 28:27.471
- Where is Anne?
- In her room.

28:27.675 --> 28:31.634
- Any point in taking these to her?
- I wouldn't disturb her now.

28:31.835 --> 28:33.473
- Oh?
- Yes.

28:33.635 --> 28:35.034
- Was she...?
- Very.

28:35.235 --> 28:39.069
Very what? You two don't even
need words. The perfect marriage.

28:39.235 --> 28:40.748
- How bad?
- Breakage.

28:40.955 --> 28:44.743
- Really bad. You suppose the setup...?
- No, she's too sophisticated.

28:44.955 --> 28:48.231
- Discovering occupied territory?
- Couldn't care less.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.794
- You think.
- I know.

28:49.995 --> 28:51.348
Know what about Anne?

28:51.555 --> 28:54.228
Anne is fine.
And delighted to be here.

28:54.435 --> 28:58.269
Forgive me. I stood on that platform
for hours waving these.

28:58.475 --> 29:02.627
- I should have telephoned.
- What's the difference? We're all here.

29:02.835 --> 29:06.589
- I'm here. I'm Elsa Mackenbourg.
- I thought you knew each other.

29:06.755 --> 29:09.144
Not as well as I'd like to.
Pretty dress.

29:09.315 --> 29:13.547
Not as pretty as some of yours
I've got. They are just brilliant.

29:13.755 --> 29:16.269
You're kind.
But the line of that suits you.

29:16.475 --> 29:19.387
The colour is good
when I'm not half peeling.

29:19.555 --> 29:22.991
I have lotion that will help
on my dressing table.

29:23.195 --> 29:26.585
I'm going to sink in the water
and drown in the sun.

29:26.755 --> 29:31.306
- I'll show you the way.
- I can see the way. Straight down.

29:31.515 --> 29:34.587
I'm going to put that lotion on
right this minute.

29:34.795 --> 29:39.232
If that woman says it will help,
it will help. She's brilliant.

29:41.435 --> 29:43.426
- Amazing figure.
- Never mind that.

29:43.635 --> 29:45.193
- I thought she said...
- What?

29:45.395 --> 29:48.148
- She was leaving.
- What is going on?

29:48.315 --> 29:51.068
- I haven't a clue.
- We'd better find out.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.513
Anne?

29:59.435 --> 30:01.153
Anne.

30:02.275 --> 30:03.993
Anne.

30:07.875 --> 30:10.105
- What's so funny?
- Your face.

30:10.275 --> 30:13.904
I could almost see you
figuring out something to say.

30:14.195 --> 30:15.514
It's not too easy.

30:15.715 --> 30:17.785
When I invited you,
I had no idea Elsa...

30:17.955 --> 30:20.025
- No explanations.
- I want to.

30:20.195 --> 30:23.392
Explanations only make
things more complicated.

30:23.595 --> 30:26.507
- They certainly do. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:26.715 --> 30:29.627
- I'm sorry, darling.
- As long as you're staying.

30:29.835 --> 30:32.793
- I don't know that I am.
- I don't know where we are.

30:32.995 --> 30:36.670
I got stupidly angry before
and decided to leave.

30:36.875 --> 30:41.346
Then the prospect of packing again
and looking for a hotel was too much.

30:41.555 --> 30:43.864
- So you decided to stay.
- Overnight.

30:44.035 --> 30:47.027
- I thought...
- Then, if I'm staying overnight...

30:47.235 --> 30:52.355
- Might as well spend the holiday.
- Yes. If I find that I like it.

30:54.795 --> 30:58.583
- She'll be gone in two days.
- No, she'll stay.

30:58.915 --> 31:00.633
How can you be so sure?

31:00.835 --> 31:03.872
I know women.
I know how to make them like it.

31:04.035 --> 31:08.586
- You want her to stay?
- Yes. Yes, I want her to stay.

31:08.795 --> 31:11.184
She has an amazingly good figure.

31:12.675 --> 31:15.394
<i>Anne stayed. And we lik ed it.</i>

31:15.595 --> 31:17.074
<i>All three of us.</i>

31:17.275 --> 31:19.391
<i>And the maids as well.</i>

31:19.555 --> 31:23.184
<i>She ran them. She ran the house.</i>

31:23.395 --> 31:25.750
<i>She ran us.</i>

31:28.675 --> 31:31.553
- This is my dance.
- It doesn't seem to be.

31:41.395 --> 31:43.625
<i>She made everything so easy
for us...</i>

31:43.795 --> 31:47.470
<i>... that we wondered how
we had ever managed without her.</i>

31:47.675 --> 31:51.588
<i>And we made everything
such fun for her.</i>

31:51.795 --> 31:53.672
<i>We did have fun then.</i>

31:53.875 --> 31:57.106
<i>And everyone was so nice
to everyone else.</i>

32:09.995 --> 32:12.907
Anne? Anne?

32:15.915 --> 32:18.748
- We thought you deserted us.
- Never.

32:18.915 --> 32:20.826
We ordered for you.

32:21.035 --> 32:24.345
- Where's Elsa?
- She's dancing with Pierre Shube.

32:25.715 --> 32:28.832
- He's a marvellous dancer.
- Or as Elsa would say:

32:28.995 --> 32:30.110
Brilliant.

32:30.275 --> 32:33.347
How can you all sit
with that brilliant music?

32:33.555 --> 32:36.023
It's made me forget
the last of my sunburn.

32:36.195 --> 32:38.789
- Where's your friend?
- Leading the band.

32:45.475 --> 32:48.114
- Come on, let's get with it.
- No, Elsa.

32:48.315 --> 32:50.749
It's so easy, Raymond. Just wiggle.

32:50.915 --> 32:55.067
Put it out here and put it back there.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.624
Look at them. It's wonderful.

33:09.795 --> 33:11.228
Come on, then.

33:11.755 --> 33:13.905
- Come on, Philippe.
- It's useless.

33:14.115 --> 33:17.630
If you can teach me to sail,
I can teach you to wiggle.

34:14.675 --> 34:19.226
Put it out here and put it back there.

34:41.955 --> 34:44.105
Wiggle, wiggle.

34:44.275 --> 34:45.503
Brilliant.

34:45.675 --> 34:47.154
Wiggle. Wiggle.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.949
I'm getting dizzy!

35:09.315 --> 35:11.385
- Better?
- Better.

36:00.755 --> 36:03.315
It should have been
someone's birthday.

36:03.515 --> 36:04.834
- It was.
- Whose?

36:04.995 --> 36:06.223
Anne's.

36:06.395 --> 36:10.946
I feel as if it was.
What a lovely, lovely evening.

36:11.155 --> 36:13.988
- I thank you.
- And we thank you.

36:14.555 --> 36:17.513
It seems you're always
having birthdays here.

36:17.715 --> 36:21.151
Not always.
It's really rather recent.

36:22.435 --> 36:24.790
Cecile, isn't it time you were in bed?

36:25.155 --> 36:28.113
- Yes.
- I think it's time we were all in bed.

36:28.275 --> 36:29.310
Oh, Anne?

36:29.475 --> 36:31.864
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

36:34.435 --> 36:36.744
- Good night, Raymond.
- Good night.

36:37.955 --> 36:40.230
Good night, darling.

36:40.475 --> 36:42.227
Very funny.

37:34.115 --> 37:38.267
- Why do they fall off so much?
- Anne never skied before this summer.

37:38.475 --> 37:40.989
I'm beginning to think
he makes her fall off.

37:45.955 --> 37:48.344
All that fooling around in the water.

37:48.515 --> 37:51.825
Even I could get
back up on skis quicker.

37:52.515 --> 37:55.632
And this sudden interest he has
in going to the market.

37:55.835 --> 37:58.030
Every time she goes, he goes.

37:58.235 --> 38:01.625
Yesterday it took all afternoon
to buy two chickens.

38:01.795 --> 38:05.470
Don't tell me it takes one afternoon
to buy two chickens.

38:05.675 --> 38:10.146
- They weren't even very good, either.
- They've known each other 15 years.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.346
With your father, nobody's safe.

38:12.555 --> 38:15.831
Anne could never be seriously
interested in a man like him.

38:16.035 --> 38:20.187
I know women. And if a man finds
the right way at the right moment...

38:20.395 --> 38:21.623
Look.

38:24.195 --> 38:26.914
I know I'm going to...!

38:29.475 --> 38:32.109
My horoscope knows more
than your law books.

38:32.275 --> 38:37.030
It says tonight is my night and
I'm going to win at the casino.

38:37.195 --> 38:39.789
- Bravo.
- There is a new moon...

38:39.995 --> 38:43.874
...and the casino is starting
a new game tonight. The craps.

38:44.315 --> 38:47.671
When did your eager little fingers
learn to hold dice?

38:47.875 --> 38:51.948
There was this spooky American
named Lucky something...

38:52.115 --> 38:53.389
I can see it all.

38:53.555 --> 38:56.672
I don't know. There isn't a three
or seven in today's date.

38:56.875 --> 38:58.433
Seven times two is 14.

38:58.635 --> 39:01.627
- But today is the fifteenth.
- Not in China.

39:01.795 --> 39:04.673
There's nothing like
this Chinese champagne.

39:04.835 --> 39:06.905
Or French laundry.

39:07.475 --> 39:08.954
You're getting giggly.

39:09.155 --> 39:13.387
If we don't go to the casino now,
you'll fall fat on your flaces.

39:13.595 --> 39:16.507
- Fat on your flace.
- No, fat on your flace.

39:16.715 --> 39:19.593
- After you.
- After you. Oh, come on.

39:43.755 --> 39:45.632
Seven again.

39:45.795 --> 39:48.707
You must have driven
like a maniac.

39:55.355 --> 39:57.107
Eleven.

39:57.515 --> 39:59.949
Seven. You won, madame.

40:00.355 --> 40:05.110
- My dear, may I ride on you?
- Tonight is my night. Ride away.

40:05.435 --> 40:07.949
Baby needs shoes.

40:09.635 --> 40:11.546
Seven again.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.947
Cecile, it's jewels and furs
for everybody.

40:15.155 --> 40:17.589
- Two and two says she does.
- Won't come.

40:17.755 --> 40:20.508
She's three and one.
Have you any sporting blood?

40:20.715 --> 40:23.388
- Mother.
- Hello, Philippe. Cecile, my dear.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.113
What are you doing here?

40:25.315 --> 40:27.954
I found a new game,
and it enchants my blood.

40:28.155 --> 40:32.467
And this friend of yours... Or of
your father's? She's brilliant.

40:32.635 --> 40:33.863
No dice.

40:34.035 --> 40:36.595
Marvellous mind.
Brain of a mathematical genius.

40:36.795 --> 40:38.672
- Who, Elsa?
- She never loses.

40:39.715 --> 40:41.671
- Eleven.
- You see?

40:41.875 --> 40:44.790
Here and this back here.
And this here.

40:44.995 --> 40:48.067
And here and here and here.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.986
- Victory!
- Victory!

40:58.195 --> 41:00.470
- Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

41:00.675 --> 41:02.905
A very old friend, Pablo de L'Amo.

41:03.115 --> 41:05.629
<i>Hello, querida. Hello, querido.</i>

41:05.835 --> 41:09.874
Hello from America.
Not North America, South America.

41:12.715 --> 41:15.354
<i>Drinks, querido!
Drinks and champagne.</i>

41:15.555 --> 41:19.025
- He's a wee bit tipsy-poo.
- He's very drunky-poo.

41:19.235 --> 41:23.990
Very drunk because I'm very rich.
Very rich because I'm very smart.

41:24.195 --> 41:28.154
Very smart because
I made it all myself in...

41:28.355 --> 41:31.233
My beautiful, Elsa,
what did I make it in?

41:31.395 --> 41:33.545
- Money!
- Right!

41:33.755 --> 41:36.747
He's drunk on champagne,
I'm drunk on gambling.

41:36.955 --> 41:39.674
You two aren't drunk.
That's not very brilliant.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.354
Not brilliant at all.

41:41.555 --> 41:44.706
- Where is Raymond?
- Dancing, probably.

41:45.835 --> 41:47.553
- Brilliant girl.
- Brilliant.

41:47.715 --> 41:51.185
And very right.
You two are not drunk on anything.

41:51.395 --> 41:52.748
Very bad.

41:52.955 --> 41:55.753
To live, you must be
drunk on something.

41:55.955 --> 42:00.392
Love. Money. Success. Failure.
Even whiskey. But something!

42:00.595 --> 42:04.190
- You're drunk, but you're right.
- Of course I am. I'm rich.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.266
Or maybe it's the other way around.

42:06.475 --> 42:11.310
- Do you always have such a good time?
- Always. Except when I'm in America.

42:11.515 --> 42:13.790
- Not North America.
- South America.

42:13.995 --> 42:17.067
You tell someone you're rich
and from America...

42:17.275 --> 42:20.073
...and they always think
you are from Texas.

42:20.275 --> 42:23.108
They are not dancing anywhere.

42:23.315 --> 42:25.351
My beautiful girl...

42:25.555 --> 42:28.115
...you are very beautiful.

42:28.315 --> 42:31.273
Also, you are very sunburned.

42:31.475 --> 42:33.386
Also, you are very peeling.

42:33.595 --> 42:37.031
Be quiet, Pablo.
I couldn't find them anyplace.

42:37.235 --> 42:41.069
- Drink your champagne, Elsa.
- Drink my champagne, Elsa.

42:41.275 --> 42:45.632
- Lucky in cards, unlucky in...
- You're too beautiful to be unlucky.

42:45.835 --> 42:47.871
- Shall I go look?
- I'll look.

42:48.075 --> 42:51.545
Anne isn't used to champagne.
She probably needed air.

42:51.715 --> 42:54.468
- Stop worrying, Elsa.
- Stop worrying, Elsa.

42:54.675 --> 42:58.429
"Isn't used to champagne."
She can drink like a man.

42:58.595 --> 43:02.304
- Then I want to meet her.
- Be still, Pablo.

43:22.315 --> 43:24.192
But it is summer, Raymond...

43:24.395 --> 43:27.865
...and I'm as suspicious of summer
as I am of you.

43:28.035 --> 43:32.233
You said I behave like a boy.
How can you be suspicious of a boy?

43:32.435 --> 43:36.474
- Easily. He likes to play with giris.
- That's true. Until now.

43:36.675 --> 43:40.190
- Now you're serious?
- From the moment you arrived.

43:40.395 --> 43:43.592
From the moment I arrived,
you've been campaigning.

43:43.795 --> 43:47.424
- And what about Elsa?
- Elsa? You know how I think of Elsa.

43:47.635 --> 43:50.103
- As a playmate for Cecile.
- Exactly.

43:50.315 --> 43:52.988
I could never think of you
as just a playmate.

43:53.195 --> 43:56.744
- Not even for you?
- The moment I stop joking, you start.

43:56.955 --> 44:01.745
But that's what you want, isn't it?
A playmate, someone to have fun with?

44:01.955 --> 44:06.346
I do have fun with you. And that's
a long way from being all I want.

44:06.555 --> 44:08.989
And we've been over and over this.

44:09.155 --> 44:10.793
I know.

44:13.435 --> 44:15.824
Raymond, I cannot be casual.

44:16.035 --> 44:18.629
I've never been less casual
in my life.

44:19.955 --> 44:23.072
- Then why am I still so frightened?
- I don't know.

44:23.275 --> 44:27.871
I'm often frightened when I want
something badly. And I want you.

44:28.075 --> 44:31.351
I've never wanted any woman
the way I want you.

44:46.675 --> 44:48.427
No, Raymond.

44:48.835 --> 44:50.507
Raymond, no.

44:55.195 --> 45:00.110
<i>Part of me was angry. Part of me
was happy. All of me was excited.</i>

45:00.315 --> 45:04.547
<i>He had brought a girl to the seashore,
made her go out in the sun...</i>

45:04.715 --> 45:08.913
<i>... then when she was a mess of
peeling, dropped her lik e a hot lobster.</i>

45:09.115 --> 45:13.267
<i>It was unfair. Yet even while
I was angry at him...</i>

45:13.475 --> 45:17.912
<i>... I was proud that he had gotten
the unattainable Anne.</i>

45:18.115 --> 45:22.745
<i>How long would it last?
Well, how long did Elsa last?</i>

45:22.915 --> 45:25.429
<i>How long did any of them last?</i>

45:25.635 --> 45:29.423
Anne wasn't feeling well.
My father had to take her home.

45:29.635 --> 45:31.307
They have gone?

45:31.515 --> 45:33.153
Yes. How about a drink?

45:33.355 --> 45:35.232
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you.

45:35.435 --> 45:38.347
- Would you like to dance?
- No, thank you.

45:38.555 --> 45:42.184
She was awfully sick, Elsa.
She ruined that beautiful dress.

45:42.395 --> 45:45.114
It was a horrible, frumpy dress.

45:45.275 --> 45:47.914
- We were all so happy.
- So happy.

45:48.075 --> 45:51.226
- We can still be happy, Elsa.
- No, we can't.

45:51.395 --> 45:54.034
- No, we can't.
- Be still, Pablo.

45:54.235 --> 45:58.945
- Come on, we'll take you home.
- I have no home. I'm not going back.

45:59.155 --> 46:03.512
- Elsa, be reasonable.
- I will not be treated like a wife.

46:03.715 --> 46:06.548
Pablo will find me a hotel.

46:06.755 --> 46:09.144
I'll buy you a hotel.

46:10.275 --> 46:11.867
Goodbye, Philippe.

46:12.075 --> 46:15.750
- You liked me, didn't you?
- I still do, Elsa.

46:16.155 --> 46:18.828
We were good friends, weren't we?

46:19.035 --> 46:20.707
I'll see you, Elsa.

46:20.915 --> 46:24.225
Never. Never again.

46:24.435 --> 46:26.187
Never again.

46:29.395 --> 46:32.626
Poor Elsa. I feel as though
I were losing a good friend.

46:32.835 --> 46:36.350
- I'm confused. Know what I'd like to do?
- What?

46:36.515 --> 46:40.394
I'd like to go someplace alone with you
and get very drunky-poo.

46:40.595 --> 46:44.065
Philippe, you'll be a credit
to your mother yet.

46:54.355 --> 46:57.665
- Good morning, mademoiselle.
- Good morning, Albertine.

47:07.795 --> 47:11.390
Holy Buddha! You are Albertine.

47:24.955 --> 47:27.071
Come and sit with us.

47:27.555 --> 47:30.115
Appearances indicate
you stopped for a nightcap.

47:30.275 --> 47:32.743
- A whole hat.
- Is that ice cream?

47:32.915 --> 47:35.588
- It's vanilla. Her hangover cure.
- It works.

47:35.755 --> 47:37.825
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

47:37.995 --> 47:40.589
- Good morning, Cecile.
- Good morning, Anne.

47:43.955 --> 47:47.470
You both look so mysterious.
As if you had a secret.

47:47.635 --> 47:49.068
- Well...
- Well...

47:50.155 --> 47:52.225
- Have you a cigarette?
- I'll get one.

47:52.395 --> 47:55.148
Don't bother, because
I don't really want one.

47:55.555 --> 47:57.625
We would like to ask you something.

47:57.795 --> 48:01.788
Elsa's in a hotel. Some South
American was taking care of her.

48:01.955 --> 48:04.753
- No, no, it's not that.
- What, then?

48:06.835 --> 48:11.147
- Your father and I want to get married.
- We'd like it very much.

48:14.515 --> 48:18.588
Well, it's a good idea.
It's a very good idea.

48:18.755 --> 48:21.223
Glad that's over.
I told you she'd be pleased.

48:21.395 --> 48:23.226
- Of course I am.
- I wasn't sure.

48:23.395 --> 48:26.148
- You never believe me.
- Yes, I do. I do.

48:28.315 --> 48:32.752
Now that the approval's official, we'll
celebrate. Champagne? Or ice cream?

48:32.915 --> 48:34.348
May I have both?

48:34.595 --> 48:36.745
You can have anything you want.

48:39.955 --> 48:42.708
- You are pleased?
- Yes.

48:42.875 --> 48:44.467
But confused?

48:45.155 --> 48:48.670
It's just hard for me to smile
too much with this head.

48:48.835 --> 48:51.110
- Is that really all?
- Yes.

48:51.955 --> 48:56.426
Does our getting married seem
strange to you or just ridiculous?

48:56.755 --> 49:00.304
- Not ridiculous at all.
- But strange?

49:00.875 --> 49:03.992
- A little.
- Why?

49:06.195 --> 49:10.188
Say it. Say anything, Cecile.
I want you to.

49:11.155 --> 49:15.467
I have to kind of push everything
around to think of Raymond married.

49:15.635 --> 49:18.024
You didn't want him to marry again?

49:18.195 --> 49:21.153
No, I mean,
I didn't think he wanted to.

49:21.315 --> 49:25.228
But if he does, I do.
If he's glad, I'm glad.

49:26.315 --> 49:31.594
That makes me so happy. You know,
I was rather frightened of you.

49:31.755 --> 49:33.154
Of me? Why?

49:33.515 --> 49:36.075
I was afraid of your being
frightened of me.

49:36.235 --> 49:38.305
I was. Until just this minute.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.750
- Well, never be again.
- I won't.

49:40.915 --> 49:42.792
I've told Albertine the news.

49:43.115 --> 49:45.265
- That is Albertine, isn't it?
- Yes.

49:45.435 --> 49:49.144
Anyway, I told her the news.
And she's happier than we are.

49:49.315 --> 49:51.909
I think we've seen
the last of her sisters.

49:52.115 --> 49:54.470
You see, you make everybody happy.

49:54.635 --> 49:57.069
- Doesn't she, Cecile?
- Yes.

50:01.995 --> 50:07.592
<i>Did I really believe that?
Well, at least I tried to.</i>

50:07.755 --> 50:10.667
<i>And I tried to live
as though it were true.</i>

50:10.835 --> 50:15.067
<i>As though the subtle but swift
changes Anne made in our daily life...</i>

50:15.235 --> 50:17.590
<i>... made me happy too.</i>

50:18.475 --> 50:21.828
It isn't that I don't believe
your father has changed.

50:21.995 --> 50:23.792
I want too much to believe it.

50:23.955 --> 50:27.027
What difference could a change
in him mean to you?

50:27.195 --> 50:30.790
If he changes, you change.
If he's happy with one person...

50:30.955 --> 50:34.994
Raymond is happy with Anne. It's
different than with Elsa or with...

50:35.155 --> 50:39.990
He loves Anne. And he wants the kind
of life she wants. You've seen them.

50:40.155 --> 50:42.794
Belonging to one person
can make you happy.

50:42.955 --> 50:48.632
Anne is different too.
She looks softer. She moves easier.

50:48.795 --> 50:52.913
- In the morning, she seems...
- Seems how?

50:53.835 --> 50:58.829
As though she had the most wonderful
secret in the worid.

50:59.315 --> 51:05.390
I wish I walked the way she walks now.
I wish I had the look she has. I wish...

51:09.995 --> 51:11.792
You said we weren't
to do this anymore.

51:11.955 --> 51:13.786
I don't care.

51:19.235 --> 51:20.554
Cecile!

51:28.115 --> 51:30.868
I think perhaps you had better go,
Philippe.

51:31.035 --> 51:35.074
- You got the wrong impressión. There...
- I think you'd better go.

51:43.635 --> 51:47.230
You realize that such diversions
can end up in a hospital.

51:47.395 --> 51:50.512
We were only kissing.
That won't end up in any hospital.

51:50.675 --> 51:54.748
- Please don't see him again, Cecile.
- What if I say I love him?

51:56.755 --> 51:59.189
I don't think you do, darling.

51:59.355 --> 52:03.633
Love doesn't depend on that.
Nor is it the only way to express it.

52:03.795 --> 52:06.150
But I enjoy Philippe
and I want to see him.

52:06.315 --> 52:09.625
And I feel a great responsibility
towards you now.

52:09.795 --> 52:13.708
- I cannot allow you to ruin your life.
- Are you ruining yours?

52:17.395 --> 52:22.025
Your father and I are going to be
married. Also, I am not 17.

52:22.195 --> 52:25.187
Seventeen now isn't what it was
when you were 17.

52:25.355 --> 52:28.427
I'm not a child, Anne.
And I won't be treated like one.

52:28.595 --> 52:31.632
I don't want you
to see Philippe again, Cecile.

52:31.795 --> 52:36.391
You will have studying to do. That
will keep you busy in the afternoons.

52:36.555 --> 52:39.831
My father tells me what to do,
not you.

52:52.635 --> 52:54.034
I suppose she told you.

52:54.195 --> 52:57.665
- She tells me, and I adore listening.
- You know what I mean.

52:57.835 --> 53:01.384
- I never know what anybody means.
- Stop joking.

53:02.515 --> 53:06.064
I'm sorry. We were only kissing,
and Anne thought...

53:06.235 --> 53:12.424
I didn't. I simply feel it would be good
if she stopped seeing Philippe...

53:12.595 --> 53:15.473
...and studied for her
philosophy examination.

53:15.635 --> 53:16.988
Couldn't she do both?

53:17.155 --> 53:21.626
Philippe is well-behaved. Not a good
sense of humour, but nice. I like him.

53:21.795 --> 53:25.424
Cecile is nice and I like her,
but they have nothing to do.

53:25.595 --> 53:27.074
We have a great deal to do.

53:27.235 --> 53:31.626
We play tennis, go sailing, swimming
and skin-diving. Healthy things.

53:31.795 --> 53:36.107
Physical things. If anything happened,
you couldn't really blame them.

53:36.275 --> 53:39.506
- Yes, I see what you mean.
- You do?

53:39.675 --> 53:44.146
You should do some work. You don't
want to fail philosophy and take it over.

53:44.315 --> 53:46.988
I couldn't care less
and neither could you.

53:47.155 --> 53:52.593
Cecile, would it be so hard to study
just for a few weeks?

53:52.755 --> 53:55.030
- Yes. Very hard.
- Cecile.

53:55.195 --> 53:58.426
- Are you siding with her or me?
- It's not a question of sides.

53:58.595 --> 54:02.907
Isn't it? I want to see Philippe
and not be cooped up studying.

54:03.075 --> 54:07.068
Anne wants me to study and
not see Philippe. What shall it be?

54:07.235 --> 54:10.432
Because I love Anne doesn't mean
that I love you any less.

54:10.595 --> 54:12.108
That's not an answer.

54:13.875 --> 54:18.744
Well, I think for the next few weeks
you should study and not see Philippe.

54:46.915 --> 54:51.147
She's prim and prissy and prude.

54:51.315 --> 54:54.068
And a know-it-all and I hate her.

54:57.795 --> 54:59.786
She's changed him.

54:59.955 --> 55:01.593
She'll change me.

55:03.235 --> 55:05.226
She'll change everything.

55:07.675 --> 55:11.714
I hate her. I hate her. I hate her.

55:12.115 --> 55:17.712
No, it isn't her fault he doesn't
love you anymore. It's yours.

55:17.875 --> 55:23.108
You're spoiled and wilful
and arrogant and lazy.

55:23.315 --> 55:25.624
A mean little monster.

55:28.835 --> 55:33.067
<i>Anne had made me look at myself
for the first time in my life.</i>

55:33.235 --> 55:37.672
<i>And that turned me against her.
Dead against her.</i>

55:48.115 --> 55:50.549
I'll be with you in a moment,
Jacques.

55:56.635 --> 55:58.990
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not angry.

55:59.155 --> 56:00.907
Then why are you leaving?

56:01.075 --> 56:05.148
I don't really know.
You go to a place, you leave a place.

56:06.635 --> 56:09.752
- But he's not for you.
- Who is?

56:09.915 --> 56:11.314
Not him, at any rate.

56:12.395 --> 56:14.147
Where do you live, Hubert?

56:14.755 --> 56:17.747
Where do I live?
You know where I live.

56:18.235 --> 56:22.023
You know where I live?
Limbo. With my father.

56:58.555 --> 56:59.783
There's Jacques.

56:59.955 --> 57:02.833
What happened?
I thought you weren't gonna show.

57:02.995 --> 57:04.667
You know better than that.

57:04.835 --> 57:08.908
- This evening you're very peculiar.
- I'm a very peculiar girl.

57:09.075 --> 57:13.034
- You're my girl, aren't you?
- Yes, Raymond. I'm your girl.

57:13.195 --> 57:16.551
- We have great fun, don't we?
- Yes, we have great fun.

57:17.235 --> 57:22.025
<i>Does he really still have fun?
I know he wants to desperately.</i>

57:22.195 --> 57:24.834
<i>And I knew he wouldn't
have much with Anne.</i>

57:24.995 --> 57:29.591
<i>Which was probably another reason
I decided to get rid of her.</i>

57:30.235 --> 57:36.265
<i>How carefully, how seriously I went
about that decisión. What a little beast.</i>

57:36.435 --> 57:38.073
<i>While pretending to study...</i>

57:38.235 --> 57:42.592
<i>... I actually spent days comparing
the contestants for my father.</i>

57:42.755 --> 57:44.905
<i>Comparing Anne and me.</i>

57:45.075 --> 57:48.863
<i>All our good points,
against all our bad ones.</i>

58:03.075 --> 58:08.593
<i>I meant to be fair, but the score
was against me. Definitely.</i>

58:11.835 --> 58:16.192
<i>Anne was out. How to get her out
might have been difficult...</i>

58:16.355 --> 58:20.587
<i>... if the way, the trap,
had not been opened for me.</i>

58:20.755 --> 58:22.108
Come in, Albertine.

58:24.795 --> 58:27.867
Elsa? What's happened to you?

58:28.035 --> 58:31.471
I'm tan, all over.
Don't I look brilliant?

58:31.635 --> 58:36.834
- Absolutely. And a new dress?
- Several new dresses, shoes and bags.

58:36.995 --> 58:41.466
- From your gambling money?
- No, from Pablo. For my birthday.

58:41.635 --> 58:44.593
I thought you had that birthday
three months ago.

58:44.795 --> 58:49.664
I did. But he was in America then.
South America.

58:50.515 --> 58:54.110
Pablo said to leave my old things here,
but I'm sentimental.

58:54.275 --> 58:56.106
I packed everything myself.

58:56.275 --> 58:58.584
- How is Raymond?
- Miserable.

58:58.755 --> 59:00.029
Really?

59:00.195 --> 59:02.834
Well, he is,
but he doesn't know it yet.

59:02.995 --> 59:06.385
She doesn't give him a chance
to know it. She's very clever.

59:06.555 --> 59:07.829
Brilliant.

59:07.995 --> 59:11.192
You don't know how clever.
He's agreed to marry her.

59:11.355 --> 59:15.348
- Marry? Raymond is going to marry?
- Yes.

59:15.915 --> 59:18.668
- It serves him right.
- How can you say that?

59:18.835 --> 59:20.871
- He threw me out.
- You walked out.

59:21.035 --> 59:24.345
He dumped me at the casino.
No lady goes home alone.

59:24.515 --> 59:27.154
- You had me and Philippe.
- I have my pride.

59:27.315 --> 59:28.543
And Pablo.

59:28.715 --> 59:31.354
Pablo.
He drinks and laughs and drinks...

59:31.515 --> 59:34.951
- Elsa, it's fate.
- I hate fate. That stupid horoscope...

59:35.115 --> 59:38.949
It's fate that you walked in here.
I was thinking about you.

59:39.115 --> 59:40.548
Really? What?

59:40.715 --> 59:43.309
I was thinking how Raymond
still loves you.

59:43.475 --> 59:46.512
- Cecile.
- Deep down he loves you. You know it.

59:46.675 --> 59:49.872
Yes, he loves me so madly,
he's going to marry Anne.

59:50.035 --> 59:52.947
It's the idea of marriage
that appeals to him.

59:53.115 --> 59:54.343
You think so?

59:54.515 --> 59:58.667
- He always wants to try something new.
- But he has been married.

59:58.835 --> 01:00:02.669
Yes, but so long ago
he's forgotten he didn't like it.

01:00:02.835 --> 01:00:05.713
- lf he marries again, he's ruined.
- So are you.

01:00:05.875 --> 01:00:09.026
I know. I wish you wanted to help.

01:00:09.195 --> 01:00:13.586
What can I do? It's too late. I walked
out when I should have stayed.

01:00:13.755 --> 01:00:16.110
- Where are you going?
- Back to Cannes.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:17.833
- Must you?
- No.

01:00:17.995 --> 01:00:19.428
Do you want to?

01:00:19.755 --> 01:00:24.670
No. I love Raymond. I'd still be here
if it weren't for that scheming...

01:00:24.835 --> 01:00:26.553
That's what she is.
Scheming.

01:00:26.715 --> 01:00:32.073
- Ask Philippe's mother if you can stay.
- I can. She thinks I'm brilliant. But why?

01:00:32.235 --> 01:00:36.274
- Say you don't have a place to stay.
- Yes, but why go at all?

01:00:36.435 --> 01:00:40.553
I have an idea. It isn't worked out yet
and there isn't time to explain.

01:00:40.715 --> 01:00:43.183
- But Cecile...?
- Do you want Raymond back?

01:00:43.355 --> 01:00:45.585
- You know I do.
- Then hurry to Philippe's.

01:00:45.755 --> 01:00:47.950
- Do you have a car?
- Yes. Pablo was...

01:00:48.115 --> 01:00:50.948
You drive.
I'll walk and meet you there.

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:54.790
- Why don't you come with me?
- I don't want them to see us together.

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:56.911
Besides, I have to work out my plan.

01:00:57.075 --> 01:01:01.865
That means concentration and being
alone. Now, hurry. Go the back way.

01:01:02.035 --> 01:01:03.263
All right.

01:01:05.035 --> 01:01:06.354
Cecile.

01:01:06.675 --> 01:01:09.712
- What now?
- I feel so good.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:31.831
- Cecile? Cecile? Where are you going?
- For a walk in the woods.

01:01:31.995 --> 01:01:35.351
You've been working so hard.
Relax. Go and take a swim.

01:01:35.515 --> 01:01:38.632
- No, thank you.
- I'll come. The water's very watery.

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:42.674
I have to concentrate. I'm working out
a problem. In philosophy.

01:01:42.835 --> 01:01:44.826
Now surely philosophy can wait.

01:01:44.995 --> 01:01:49.705
Not Pascal. He's demanding. You want
me to meet his demands, don't you?

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:52.753
Any man would wait
while you took a swim.

01:01:52.915 --> 01:01:54.394
Not this one.

01:02:14.035 --> 01:02:15.673
- Did Elsa come...?
- Yes!

01:02:16.635 --> 01:02:18.944
- Let's get married.
- It's an epidemic.

01:02:19.115 --> 01:02:21.231
- I'm serious.
- You're only a boy.

01:02:21.395 --> 01:02:23.113
I only look like a boy. I'm 25.

01:02:23.275 --> 01:02:26.631
- Where's Elsa? Did your mother...?
- I love you. I'm proposing.

01:02:26.795 --> 01:02:31.152
- I heard you the first time.
- You didn't answer because it's no.

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:35.513
I didn't answer because Anne would
answer for me, and she'd say no.

01:02:35.675 --> 01:02:39.634
- Can't we get rid of Anne?
- That's why I sent Elsa down here.

01:02:39.795 --> 01:02:41.069
Then you do love me?

01:02:41.235 --> 01:02:45.228
I don't quite get the connection,
but, yes, I do. Where's Elsa?

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:47.511
She's watching Mother play bridge.

01:02:47.675 --> 01:02:50.314
- She told Mother she was an orphan.
- Why?

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:54.593
She thought it was a good touch.
Everybody feels sorry for orphans.

01:02:54.755 --> 01:02:58.634
- I feel rather sorry for Elsa.
- Why the change?

01:02:58.795 --> 01:03:01.673
I didn't realize Anne was such
an adventuress...

01:03:01.835 --> 01:03:03.791
...or that Elsa was so sensitive.

01:03:03.955 --> 01:03:06.185
So much imagination, you mean.

01:03:10.075 --> 01:03:14.148
Collect your tiny brain and
try and do better this time.

01:03:15.075 --> 01:03:18.704
<i>- One small diamante.
- Two clubs.</i>

01:03:19.315 --> 01:03:20.794
- Pass.
- Pass?

01:03:20.955 --> 01:03:22.274
Pass.

01:03:22.515 --> 01:03:25.507
<i>- Two hearts.
- Three diamantes.</i>

01:03:26.115 --> 01:03:27.946
- Pass.
- Pass.

01:03:28.115 --> 01:03:30.106
- Pass.
- Three hearts.

01:03:30.275 --> 01:03:34.553
Three hearts? We're on the brink
of a tantalizing abyss.

01:03:34.715 --> 01:03:36.467
Do I jump or not?

01:03:36.635 --> 01:03:39.229
- Three hearts?
- What? What?

01:03:39.395 --> 01:03:42.990
Tune that thing up. She's only
repeating your pathetic bid.

01:03:43.595 --> 01:03:46.189
Stop semaphoring.
Either come in or go out.

01:03:46.635 --> 01:03:49.672
- I say jump.
- I'm with you. Come back at 5.

01:03:49.835 --> 01:03:53.544
My partner has to go.
You and I will sweep the field.

01:03:55.315 --> 01:03:57.033
- Where can we talk?
- My room.

01:03:57.195 --> 01:04:00.187
I can't wait to hear your plan.
I'm all goose-pimply.

01:04:00.355 --> 01:04:02.152
- I don't like intrigue.
- I do.

01:04:02.315 --> 01:04:05.671
- You want to marry me.
- What's that have to do with it?

01:04:05.835 --> 01:04:07.871
- Would Anne let me marry you?
- No.

01:04:08.035 --> 01:04:11.550
The plan concerns getting rid of Anne.
Anne concerns us.

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:13.626
- I still don't like it.
- I love it.

01:04:13.795 --> 01:04:16.832
- You haven't even heard it yet.
- Will you two be still?

01:04:16.995 --> 01:04:21.750
The basic idea is wildly simple. The
details may take a bit of working out.

01:04:21.915 --> 01:04:23.143
Is that your room?

01:04:23.315 --> 01:04:26.113
You two must pretend
to be madly in love.

01:04:26.275 --> 01:04:29.711
We have to arrange that my father
sees you together.

01:04:29.875 --> 01:04:33.106
- Jealousy, the green-eyed monster.
- Now, wait, Cecile.

01:04:33.275 --> 01:04:35.152
You wait. And let me explain.

01:04:50.435 --> 01:04:55.509
Krishnimara, aid me.
Concentration is the secret.

01:04:55.675 --> 01:04:57.313
Exhale deeply.

01:04:58.275 --> 01:05:00.231
Exhale from the mind.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.067
Exhale from the soul.

01:05:07.435 --> 01:05:10.586
Now, then, suppose I tell Elsa.

01:05:10.755 --> 01:05:13.713
No, suppose I tell Philippe.

01:05:13.915 --> 01:05:16.907
- Go away, Albertine.
- It isn't Albertine...

01:05:18.155 --> 01:05:20.828
Yoga. Hindu philosophy.

01:05:29.355 --> 01:05:33.268
I wasn't aware that yoga
was part of your examination.

01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:39.631
All those discussions about
your paper on Pascal...

01:05:39.795 --> 01:05:42.707
...and how difficult Spinoza
was for you.

01:05:44.435 --> 01:05:48.269
Cecile, have you actually done
any studying at all?

01:05:51.555 --> 01:05:55.787
In the end, it's your own affair
if you fail your examinations...

01:05:55.955 --> 01:06:00.107
...but it is another matter
when you lie to your father and to me.

01:06:01.275 --> 01:06:02.833
Why did you lie?

01:06:06.835 --> 01:06:09.907
I really don't understand you at all.

01:06:13.075 --> 01:06:14.827
And you never will!

01:08:13.355 --> 01:08:15.505
I would like to apologize.

01:08:16.194 --> 01:08:20.108
I sometimes forget that you're
still a child. Now, please...

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:23.153
...don't let that word offend you.

01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:26.591
It's merely a short way of saying...

01:08:26.755 --> 01:08:28.984
...you're still young enough...

01:08:29.154 --> 01:08:31.988
...to pattern your behaviour after
people older than you.

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:35.426
You mean I'm not to blame
for behaving like Raymond?

01:08:35.595 --> 01:08:40.305
No, you're not. Or for being influenced
by the way he used to live...

01:08:40.475 --> 01:08:45.674
...or the friends he, I hope,
won't see very much of from now on.

01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:50.390
The Lombards, for instance.
They telephoned from their yacht.

01:08:50.555 --> 01:08:53.228
They're taking us to dinner
and a club Tuesday.

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:56.671
We have to go.
He's your father's business partner.

01:08:56.835 --> 01:09:00.191
I think they're very amusing.
They always make me laugh.

01:09:00.354 --> 01:09:04.746
There will be risqué stories
deliberately in front of you.

01:09:04.915 --> 01:09:09.430
Helen Lombard will make sly and
bitter jokes about her friends and...

01:09:09.595 --> 01:09:14.953
...compare Raymond's muscles with
her newest young chauffeur, a nephew.

01:09:15.115 --> 01:09:18.743
Henri will confide in Raymond
about his new girl, a model...

01:09:18.915 --> 01:09:21.109
...while he rubs your knee
under the table.

01:09:21.274 --> 01:09:24.187
Your knee being younger than mine.

01:09:24.354 --> 01:09:28.109
In a few years, the nephew-chauffeur
will make off with the car...

01:09:28.274 --> 01:09:31.346
...and the latest model
will wear Helen's jewellery.

01:09:31.515 --> 01:09:34.791
Friends will laugh at them
rather than at their jokes.

01:09:34.955 --> 01:09:38.470
- At least they're having a good time.
- Are they?

01:09:38.635 --> 01:09:42.149
Then why do they drink so much
and so often?

01:09:42.314 --> 01:09:45.546
Why are they never alone
with each other?

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:48.752
In the end, their only memories
will be of hangovers.

01:09:48.915 --> 01:09:51.109
I have another moral, Anne.

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:54.312
If you can't accept people
as they are, give them up.

01:09:54.475 --> 01:09:59.595
Don't try to change them.
Besides, it's usually too late.

01:10:14.035 --> 01:10:17.909
Why, you're almost
as strong as Rene.

01:10:18.435 --> 01:10:22.553
Rene, darling,
Rene is Helen's new chauffeur.

01:10:22.715 --> 01:10:24.990
- And nephew.
- On which side?

01:10:25.155 --> 01:10:27.794
On the left side. It's an American car.

01:10:28.275 --> 01:10:31.347
Wicked, but sweet.
Don't you think they're sweet?

01:10:31.515 --> 01:10:33.949
- Young love in late fall.
- Thank you.

01:10:34.115 --> 01:10:37.027
How does little Cecile feel
about her father getting married?

01:10:37.195 --> 01:10:40.710
Little Cecile feels like
having a great big drink.

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:43.514
Of course.
That's why we're here. Waiter?

01:10:43.675 --> 01:10:46.235
- We were at a party the other night.
- Fantastic.

01:10:46.395 --> 01:10:49.193
- Who's gonna tell this story?
- I am.

01:10:49.355 --> 01:10:50.629
Waiter?

01:10:50.795 --> 01:10:54.504
You'll never believe the amount
of liquor that was consumed.

01:10:54.675 --> 01:10:57.428
Isn't that Elsa Mackenbourg
over there?

01:11:28.275 --> 01:11:30.072
She's grown into a beautiful trick.

01:11:30.235 --> 01:11:32.749
- Who is the boy?
- Her nephew.

01:11:32.915 --> 01:11:35.713
- Cecile!
- Well, he's young enough.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:38.184
Everywhere we've been,
there they are.

01:11:38.355 --> 01:11:41.984
- She's flaunting her achievement.
- I prefer to rise above it.

01:11:42.155 --> 01:11:45.386
- It's all so unimportant, Raymond.
- It's disgraceful.

01:11:45.555 --> 01:11:48.831
- That boy has a good face.
- And he's a good driver.

01:11:48.995 --> 01:11:53.466
You're well rid of him.
Matter of fact, it's indecent.

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.948
Anne.

01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:08.147
You look particularly lovely tonight.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.192
Thank you.

01:12:16.195 --> 01:12:19.108
This is fun. We ought to go
for walks more often.

01:12:19.275 --> 01:12:21.709
- Those days are over.
- Nonsense.

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:25.709
- Your days with the Lombards are over.
- Putting me out of business?

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:28.184
I meant socially.
Anne doesn't like them.

01:12:28.355 --> 01:12:31.392
- She will in time.
- No, she won't. You know Anne.

01:12:31.555 --> 01:12:33.944
- Why don't you like her?
- I do.

01:12:34.115 --> 01:12:36.913
You may like her,
but you're always squabbling.

01:12:37.075 --> 01:12:39.543
You're a little bit
like a mother-in-law.

01:12:39.715 --> 01:12:44.072
Mother-in-law will just marry earlier.
That will solve all the problems.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:48.467
- You don't have to go that far.
- I exaggerate, and you know it.

01:12:48.635 --> 01:12:52.867
But Anne's way of living is better
than ours, and I have to face it.

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:54.514
Good, then face it.

01:12:54.675 --> 01:12:57.428
It has depth and stability
and wholesomeness.

01:12:57.595 --> 01:13:01.144
- You make it sound like a terrible bore.
- It's the good life.

01:13:01.315 --> 01:13:02.953
Come down off the pulpit.

01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:07.233
We know that your life with me has
not been suitable for your age or mine.

01:13:07.395 --> 01:13:08.794
We've never been bored.

01:13:08.955 --> 01:13:12.664
We won't be bored now. Anne's
not asking us to go into a convent.

01:13:12.835 --> 01:13:15.065
I just came out and
you couldn't get in.

01:13:15.235 --> 01:13:16.953
That's your opinion.

01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:19.913
- lf you want to make her happy...
- I do.

01:13:20.075 --> 01:13:22.430
Then you have to give up
our old life.

01:13:22.595 --> 01:13:26.952
Don't you think that after a while
we can gradually ease into it?

01:13:29.235 --> 01:13:30.748
Don't.

01:13:30.915 --> 01:13:32.428
Come on.

01:13:44.155 --> 01:13:47.591
- That little tramp. She is.
- You threw her out.

01:13:47.755 --> 01:13:50.633
- She walked out.
- You behaved abominably to her.

01:13:50.795 --> 01:13:53.867
- You enjoy seeing her with Philippe?
- I don't love him.

01:13:54.035 --> 01:13:56.503
- That's not the point.
- What is?

01:13:56.675 --> 01:14:00.987
The point is, it doesn't make
any sense. With a boy. With a baby.

01:14:01.155 --> 01:14:04.033
- I found him attractive.
- lf I wanted her back...

01:14:04.275 --> 01:14:06.266
- You couldn't.
- No?

01:14:06.435 --> 01:14:10.553
You think I couldn't get her back
because he's a few years younger.

01:14:10.715 --> 01:14:13.354
What's the enchantment
with these woods?

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:15.585
Anne, how old am I?

01:14:15.755 --> 01:14:20.783
Old enough to marry me next month.
But just barely.

01:15:01.435 --> 01:15:04.711
Elsa, what are you done up as?

01:15:05.275 --> 01:15:08.631
You're behaving like an amateur spy.

01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:10.990
You could've telephoned
instead of sending this.

01:15:11.155 --> 01:15:13.623
I didn't want anyone
to recognize my voice.

01:15:13.795 --> 01:15:19.665
- "All's well. Come." What does it mean?
- It means your plan worked brilliantly.

01:15:19.835 --> 01:15:23.953
Raymond telephoned me last night
to say he was madly sorry.

01:15:24.115 --> 01:15:29.235
And that he had behaved like an
absolute monster cad. It was heaven.

01:15:29.395 --> 01:15:33.707
He rumbled a lot of divinely
sweet things in that way of his.

01:15:33.875 --> 01:15:39.745
You know, quietly in a low, deep voice
as if he were suffering.

01:15:39.915 --> 01:15:42.349
- It was shivery.
- I'm sure.

01:15:42.515 --> 01:15:47.384
Then he asked me to meet him after
lunch to show I had no hard feelings.

01:15:47.555 --> 01:15:50.023
- Meet him where?
- He said not to tell a soul.

01:15:50.195 --> 01:15:51.913
He meant Philippe, not me.

01:15:52.075 --> 01:15:55.147
I don't know.
He doesn't know that you know that...

01:15:55.315 --> 01:15:57.704
Where are you supposed
to meet him?

01:15:57.875 --> 01:16:00.708
- He said not to tell.
- Then don't.

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:02.627
But should I go?

01:16:02.795 --> 01:16:07.152
Meet him, don't meet him. Do whatever
you want. Only don't ask me.

01:16:07.315 --> 01:16:12.594
It's getting out of hand. I just wish
I were a lot older or a lot younger.

01:16:20.595 --> 01:16:24.793
Pig, pig, pig. I ate like a pig.

01:16:24.955 --> 01:16:26.673
Sleepy?

01:16:27.155 --> 01:16:28.952
In a way.

01:16:30.195 --> 01:16:33.267
No. I have to work.

01:16:33.435 --> 01:16:37.314
- I have to go meet Lombard anyway.
- Where are you meeting him?

01:16:37.475 --> 01:16:41.434
- His yacht's anchored around the point.
- Why don't we all go?

01:16:41.595 --> 01:16:44.268
Because I simply must get
at those sketches.

01:16:44.435 --> 01:16:47.507
- I thought you would stop work.
- After the wedding.

01:16:47.675 --> 01:16:51.304
Today is father and daughter day.
You two go.

01:16:52.755 --> 01:16:54.029
Bye.

01:16:54.195 --> 01:16:57.983
- Can I go with you?
- Darling, no. You've got to study.

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.908
Anne doesn't think Lombard's
a good influence.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:03.714
- She suggested I go.
- That's very generous of her...

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:07.026
...but I mustn't take advantage
of her generosity.

01:17:07.195 --> 01:17:11.507
<i>What a fak e. What an incredible fak e.
But I love him.</i>

01:17:11.675 --> 01:17:14.826
Don't study too hard,
Madame Pascal Spinoza.

01:17:17.475 --> 01:17:20.387
<i>It's gone too far.
I must tell her.</i>

01:17:20.555 --> 01:17:23.706
<i>I must tell her right away
that this is all my doing.</i>

01:17:38.475 --> 01:17:41.865
<i>There's no question.
I must tell her.</i>

01:17:42.035 --> 01:17:45.823
<i>But how? What can I tell her?</i>

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:51.945
<i>She'll never forgive me. And she'll
have a weapon against me forever.</i>

01:17:57.395 --> 01:17:59.192
<i>Where's she going?</i>

01:17:59.355 --> 01:18:02.665
<i>Maybe she wants to join him
at the Lombards' yacht.</i>

01:18:02.835 --> 01:18:06.953
<i>I can't let her go.
I must stop her.</i>

01:18:35.715 --> 01:18:38.104
<i>No. Maybe I won't stop her.</i>

01:18:47.755 --> 01:18:50.952
<i>I'd lik e to see what she'll do.</i>

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:02.072
- No, Raymond, stop that.
- Why?

01:20:02.235 --> 01:20:06.672
You're very nervy. You think you can
pick up right where we left off?

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.144
Not at all, you were sunburned then.

01:20:09.475 --> 01:20:13.388
- I've got a brilliant tan now, haven't I?
- Lovely.

01:20:13.555 --> 01:20:15.193
Lovelier than Anne's?

01:20:15.355 --> 01:20:19.906
Much. But then a young girl's skin
is always much lovelier.

01:20:21.955 --> 01:20:24.628
You didn't seem to think so
a few weeks ago.

01:20:24.795 --> 01:20:28.344
Stop punishing me because
I had to satisfy my curiosity.

01:20:28.515 --> 01:20:31.473
You weren't curious, you were greedy.

01:20:31.635 --> 01:20:33.990
And why were you ready to marry her?

01:20:34.155 --> 01:20:38.706
With a woman like Anne, you have to
say a thing like that and you know it.

01:20:40.115 --> 01:20:41.992
Raymond.

01:21:11.675 --> 01:21:13.267
Anne!

01:21:14.955 --> 01:21:17.594
Anne! Wait!

01:21:18.635 --> 01:21:20.990
Please stay. It's my fault.

01:21:21.155 --> 01:21:22.634
Please, Cecile, let go.

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:24.228
Anne, we need you.

01:21:24.435 --> 01:21:27.586
- You don't need anybody. Either of you.
- We do.

01:21:27.755 --> 01:21:32.954
- No, wait. Forgive me.
- No, you forgive me.

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:56.348
- Been trying to write to her.
- Where? To Paris?

01:21:56.515 --> 01:21:59.951
I suppose that's where she's gone.
What can I say?

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:03.551
"Dear Anne: I'm sorry I went
to the wood with Elsa."

01:22:03.715 --> 01:22:06.183
Meaning, "I'm sorry you caught me"?

01:22:06.355 --> 01:22:09.745
"It meant nothing to me.
That sort of thing never does."

01:22:09.915 --> 01:22:11.712
She'll never understand that.

01:22:11.875 --> 01:22:16.073
"Dear Anne: A man says silly things
to a silly woman."

01:22:16.235 --> 01:22:19.033
Particularly if he's a vain, silly man.

01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.504
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

01:22:21.675 --> 01:22:25.588
If not with Elsa, with somebody else.
I'm a very silly man.

01:22:25.755 --> 01:22:28.553
- Don't talk that way.
- At least I'm aware of it.

01:22:28.715 --> 01:22:33.186
We can get her back. We'll both write,
ask her to forgive both of us.

01:22:33.395 --> 01:22:35.431
- Why both of us?
- You, then.

01:22:35.595 --> 01:22:38.473
No, me too. I wasn't
very nice to her either.

01:22:38.635 --> 01:22:39.863
Where's that pen?

01:22:40.035 --> 01:22:44.233
If we put our silly heads together,
we can think of something to say.

01:22:45.115 --> 01:22:47.788
Maybe we won't have to write at all.

01:22:47.955 --> 01:22:49.786
Hello?

01:22:50.555 --> 01:22:52.193
Yes.

01:22:55.995 --> 01:22:57.792
Where?

01:25:04.435 --> 01:25:06.824
May I have that, please?

01:25:06.995 --> 01:25:09.384
She was a friend of ours.

01:25:15.795 --> 01:25:19.947
<i>Later they told us that was
the seventh accident at that spot...</i>

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.993
<i>... since the beginning of summer.</i>

01:25:23.155 --> 01:25:27.546
<i>Seven. My lucky number.</i>

01:25:41.315 --> 01:25:44.432
<i>Anyone else would have
left my father a note...</i>

01:25:44.595 --> 01:25:48.907
<i>... that would have ruined his sleep
for the rest of his life.</i>

01:25:49.475 --> 01:25:55.232
<i>But Anne gave both of us
a magnificently considerate present.</i>

01:25:55.595 --> 01:26:00.350
<i>She allowed us to believe
her death was an accident.</i>

01:26:04.315 --> 01:26:09.070
<i>My father never mentions the word
"suicide" to anybody.</i>

01:26:09.235 --> 01:26:11.795
<i>Not even to me.</i>

01:26:22.675 --> 01:26:24.984
Why don't we have dinner tomorrow?

01:26:25.155 --> 01:26:28.591
- There's a new club near the Tremoille.
- Yes, I've been.

01:26:28.755 --> 01:26:30.666
- Fun?
- Great fun.

01:26:30.835 --> 01:26:33.508
Well, good night.

01:26:48.675 --> 01:26:51.747
<i>I never heard from Philippe again.</i>

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:55.032
<i>I suppose he finished law school.</i>

01:26:55.395 --> 01:27:00.185
<i>Elsa, she's living in South America.</i>

01:27:00.755 --> 01:27:03.553
<i>And my father and me...</i>

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:06.745
<i>... we still share this apartment...</i>

01:27:06.915 --> 01:27:11.033
<i>... our evenings, our friends.</i>

01:27:11.395 --> 01:27:15.308
<i>This summer we're going south again
for his holiday.</i>

01:27:15.475 --> 01:27:19.229
<i>Only this time to the Italian Riviera.</i>

01:27:19.475 --> 01:27:23.070
<i>"For a change," we say to each other.</i>

01:27:23.275 --> 01:27:28.588
<i>But we don't say why we want
a change, nor do we ask.</i>

01:27:28.755 --> 01:27:33.954
<i>We have an unspok en agreement
never to mention last summer.</i>

01:27:39.115 --> 01:27:40.753
Come in.

01:27:44.755 --> 01:27:46.825
You're checking in early.

01:27:48.115 --> 01:27:50.549
Denise is a bore.

01:27:51.755 --> 01:27:53.552
So soon?

01:27:54.475 --> 01:27:57.547
Well, there's no time limit on bores.

01:27:59.635 --> 01:28:04.311
By the way, did you notice
Yvonne Marie at that cocktail party?

01:28:04.995 --> 01:28:08.271
Yes. She didn't look bad at all.

01:28:08.955 --> 01:28:11.310
No, I should say not.

01:28:11.475 --> 01:28:13.670
Not bad at all.

01:28:14.995 --> 01:28:17.873
Will you be taking her south?

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:21.429
I'll let you know
at the end of the week.

01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:25.233
If you do...

01:28:25.515 --> 01:28:28.507
...perhaps you'd rather
I didn't come.

01:28:29.675 --> 01:28:32.235
You have to come. You have to.

01:28:34.235 --> 01:28:36.146
Then I'll come.

01:28:36.755 --> 01:28:38.791
Besides...

01:28:39.635 --> 01:28:42.991
...you need the rest. You're tired.

01:28:44.675 --> 01:28:47.712
Yes, I'm tired.

01:28:48.355 --> 01:28:51.631
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, Raymond.

01:28:52.755 --> 01:28:57.704
<i>So here I am,
surrounded by my wall of memory.</i>

01:28:58.075 --> 01:29:00.794
<i>I try to stop remembering...</i>

01:29:00.955 --> 01:29:03.264
<i>... but I can't.</i>

01:29:03.795 --> 01:29:06.593
<i>And so often I wonder:</i>

01:29:06.875 --> 01:29:09.230
<i>When he's alone...</i>

01:29:09.715 --> 01:29:12.627
<i>... is he remembering too?</i>

01:29:13.875 --> 01:29:16.514
<i>I hope not.</i>
