GEORGE PELECANOS:
<i>To bring this home</i>
<i>in the last couple episodes</i>

1:11:59.482 --> 1:12:00.817
<i>was really hard.</i>

1:12:01.818 --> 1:12:04.821
Whether it was drugs

1:12:05.279 --> 1:12:07.865

1:12:18.626 --> 1:12:20.461

<i>A porn star married</i>

1:12:34.892 --> 1:12:36.519
who was dying of AIDS.

1:12:37.061 --> 1:12:40.147
It's ironic because Reg

1:12:40.231 --> 1:12:41.399

<i>from the real Vincent's story.</i>

1:12:55.580 --> 1:12:57.164
The real Vincent

1:12:57.248 --> 1:13:00.209

1:13:52.595 --> 1:13:53.971
You live without pride

you find a way to use

1:13:56.682 --> 1:13:58.935
It's a tragic situation,
it's like Arthur Miller.

1:13:59.018 --> 1:14:01.979
Both people are right.
And both people are wrong.

1:14:03.481 --> 1:14:06.734
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I think the real love story</i>

1:14:06.943 --> 1:14:08.569
is between Candy and Harvey.

1:14:08.986 --> 1:14:10.696
HARVEY WASSERMAN:
You are a filmmaker.

1:14:10.780 --> 1:14:13.324
And what you are shooting
matters.

1:14:13.532 --> 1:14:15.451
MAN: <i>Says she made</i>
<i>89 adult films,</i>

1:14:15.660 --> 1:14:18.079
<i>and one celebrated,</i>
<i>cinematic classic.</i>

1:14:18.162 --> 1:14:20.915
It's based on the movie <i>Wanda</i>
by Barbara Loden.

1:14:21.123 --> 1:14:22.375
VINCENT MARTINO:
She made a real movie, huh?

1:14:22.583 --> 1:14:24.627
PELECANOS: <i>Nobody saw that film</i>
<i>when it came out.</i>

1:14:24.835 --> 1:14:27.254
<i>But after she died,</i>
<i>people started saying,</i>

1:14:27.338 --> 1:14:28.547
how did we miss this?

1:14:29.131 --> 1:14:30.633
SIMON: <i>We all looked at the film</i>
<i>and said,</i>

1:14:30.716 --> 1:14:32.760
"This is the kind of thing
that Candy might get to."

1:14:33.469 --> 1:14:35.805
PELECANOS: <i>To think that</i>
<i>she started out on the street</i>

1:14:36.013 --> 1:14:38.432
<i>and then playing in loops</i>
<i>as an actress.</i>

1:14:38.516 --> 1:14:42.019
And then, in season three,
becoming a full‐blown artist.

1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:43.854
I think it's tremendous.

1:14:45.231 --> 1:14:46.315
Atta girl.

1:14:47.525 --> 1:14:50.111
We're closing this establishment
immediately

1:14:50.194 --> 1:14:52.571
as a public health nuisance.

1:14:53.197 --> 1:14:57.076
What ended up shuttering
most of the sex industry

1:14:57.159 --> 1:14:58.160
was money.

1:14:59.370 --> 1:15:01.497
<i>All you needed was a good</i>
<i>run up on Wall Street,</i>

1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:02.957
<i>and for people to look around</i>
<i>and say,</i>

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:05.918
"What can we build
with our cash? And where?"

1:15:06.627 --> 1:15:08.629
<i>In that sense,</i>
<i>Times Square was a ghetto,</i>

1:15:08.713 --> 1:15:09.797
and capital found it.

1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:11.924
In every problem,
there is opportunity.

1:15:12.008 --> 1:15:13.926
Way back in the first season,
we thought,

1:15:14.010 --> 1:15:15.970
wouldn't it be interesting
if Goldman,

1:15:16.053 --> 1:15:19.098
<i>as an agent of change,</i>
<i>was himself, entangled,</i>

1:15:19.181 --> 1:15:21.475
personally, in the dynamics
of the culture?

1:15:21.559 --> 1:15:22.727
I'm not a hypocrite.

1:15:22.810 --> 1:15:23.853
And here you are.

1:15:24.061 --> 1:15:25.813
SIMON: <i>It felt like we had</i>
<i>a lot to write about,</i>

1:15:25.896 --> 1:15:26.731
<i>as a conflicted character.</i>

1:15:26.939 --> 1:15:28.232
It made it
much more interesting to us.

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:29.817
Now that we're victorious,
Lieutenant,

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:31.110
where do you want to go next?

1:15:31.485 --> 1:15:33.279
SIMON: <i>Pornography's role</i>
<i>in American life,</i>

1:15:33.362 --> 1:15:34.572
<i>would just keep expanding.</i>

1:15:34.655 --> 1:15:37.658
<i>You're affected by it</i>
<i>if you're an adult in America.</i>

1:15:37.742 --> 1:15:40.077
Right down to the last
beer ad you watched.

1:15:40.286 --> 1:15:41.704
We fixed nothing, Gene.

1:15:41.787 --> 1:15:43.372
SIMON: <i>It's not like</i>
<i>the male gaze changes,</i>

1:15:43.456 --> 1:15:45.666
<i>or commodification of women</i>
<i>disappears,</i>

1:15:45.750 --> 1:15:48.002
<i>it's just a matter</i>
<i>of who gets paid,</i>

1:15:48.085 --> 1:15:49.128
and what the real estate is.

1:15:51.047 --> 1:15:53.007
If every drink is pre‐measured,

1:15:53.841 --> 1:15:56.218
how you gonna give a regular
an honest pour?

1:15:56.844 --> 1:16:00.264
SIMON: <i>We wrote a pilot</i>
<i>that begins in that bar,</i>

1:16:00.347 --> 1:16:01.891
<i>with him haranguing</i>
<i>the bartender.</i>

1:16:01.974 --> 1:16:03.684
That's the only scene
that we had

1:16:03.768 --> 1:16:05.686
going into this project
four years ago.

1:16:05.895 --> 1:16:07.104
You ever hear of the Hi‐Hat?

1:16:07.354 --> 1:16:09.940
SIMON: <i>That was in present day,</i>
<i>and then you flashed back</i>

1:16:10.024 --> 1:16:12.026
into 1971 and you begin
our story.

1:16:12.443 --> 1:16:14.779
<i>It survived through the first</i>
<i>couple of drafts of the pilot.</i>

1:16:14.862 --> 1:16:16.530
<i>And then we realized,</i>
<i>it ruins it because you know</i>

1:16:16.614 --> 1:16:18.574
that Vincent made it,
and on what terms.

1:16:19.617 --> 1:16:20.910
<i>So we decided, no we can't,</i>

1:16:20.993 --> 1:16:22.536
we just have to save it
for the end.

1:16:23.454 --> 1:16:25.998
You can see that he's
pretty much a broken man.

1:16:26.582 --> 1:16:29.376
<i>And all these choices</i>
<i>that he's made in the past</i>

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:31.295
have come back to haunt him.

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:35.216
SIMON:
<i>That's how we felt after talking</i>

1:16:35.299 --> 1:16:36.467
<i>to the real Vincent.</i>

1:16:36.967 --> 1:16:40.054
He has the sinking feeling
of being surrounded

1:16:40.137 --> 1:16:41.639
by the ghosts
of his own memory.

1:16:43.307 --> 1:16:44.225
Vincent.

1:16:44.642 --> 1:16:47.394
You get one more taste
of everybody.

1:16:47.478 --> 1:16:50.815
And they're living
in the bubble of Vince's memory.

1:16:50.898 --> 1:16:52.691
TOMMY LONGO: Like I said,
no one retires.

1:16:53.192 --> 1:16:55.111
Except maybe you, Vincent.

<i>and you can't help but</i>
<i>think about your own life.</i>
