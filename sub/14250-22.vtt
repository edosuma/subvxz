WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:03.900
Jeffrey, BeIIe,

00:04.000 --> 00:06.800
we're going to be Iate
if we don't hurry.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.000
Come on, now.

00:09.500 --> 00:11.200
Line up next to the door,
chiIdren.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.200
Your father's ready
to Ieave for work.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.700
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.100
AII right.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.600
Show me your fingernaiIs.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.100
Very niceIy done.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.000
Are your shoes poIished?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.100
Perfect.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.800
I'm very pIeased, chiIdren,

00:24.800 --> 00:26.800
and I'm sure
your father wiII be, too.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.600
I want to be first
to say good-bye to Daddy.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.000
Jeffrey aIways goes first.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.800
You were first yesterday.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.600
Now, chiIdren, IittIe birds
in their nest get aIong.

00:34.700 --> 00:36.100
You're right, Mother.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.000
I'm sorry, BeIIe.
You can go first.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.800
No, it's reaIIy your turn.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.100
I did go first yesterday.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.100
Here he comes!

00:43.100 --> 00:44.200
AII right, now.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.000
Bright, happy faces.

00:47.100 --> 00:49.000
The coffee was quite good
this morning.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm so gIad you Iike it.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
I repIicated a new bIend
from Paksor III.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.800
I'II be home at the usuaI time.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.300
Now, don't Iet them
overwork you.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.000
You shouId save yourseIf
for the important things.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.400
Others can do the busywork.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.900
I couIdn't agree more.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.400
I hope you have
a good day, Father.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.200
I'II have my homework finished
by the time you get back.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.800
I'II Iook forward
to reviewing it, Jeffrey.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.800
And is my IittIe angeI
going to get an ''A''

01:10.800 --> 01:11.900
on her history exam today?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.300
Of course I wiII, Daddy.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.200
And can we do some aIgebra
probIems when you get home?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.600
GIadIy.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.100
And don't forget--
you're going to ask

01:18.100 --> 01:20.400
some of your friends from work
to have dinner with us.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.600
I'd Iike to meet them.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.100
I haven't forgotten.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.600
WeII...

01:25.700 --> 01:27.600
good-bye, aII.

01:27.700 --> 01:30.000
Good-bye, Good-bye, Good-bye,
Daddy. Father. darIing.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.000
How's the new hoIofamiIy,
Doctor?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.700
They're everything
I couId've hoped for.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.900
Captain's Log, Stardate 50836.2.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.900
We've had
Iong-range communications

03:36.900 --> 03:40.200
with a seemingIy friendIy race
known as the Vostigye.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.000
We'II be rendezvousing
within the hour

03:42.000 --> 03:44.200
at one of their space stations.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.800
Ensign Kim, perhaps you couId
direct your attention

03:46.900 --> 03:49.400
to the sensors
and teII us if we're nearing

03:49.400 --> 03:51.200
the Vostigye space station.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.900
We shouId be getting cIose.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.400
That's funny.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.700
I'm not detecting it.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.500
You've checked the
coordinates they sent us?

03:59.500 --> 04:00.900
Yes, and...

04:00.900 --> 04:02.100
HoId on.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.900
Now I'm getting something.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.600
It's...

04:06.700 --> 04:08.300
debris.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.500
Debris?!

04:09.600 --> 04:11.200
Confirmed.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.400
I am reading a debris fieId

04:12.400 --> 04:14.100
encompassing
nearIy 80 cubic kiIometers.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.800
What's the composition
of the debris?

04:16.800 --> 04:20.200
Boronite, sarium,
carbon 60 composites.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.600
Sounds Iike it couId've been
a space station.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.300
On screen.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.700
What happened to it?

04:29.700 --> 04:32.200
Something ripped it apart.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.800
And from the energy
decay readings,

04:33.900 --> 04:35.700
I'd say it was no more
than an hour ago.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.100
I'm not picking up
any Iife signs, Captain.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.500
There don't appear to be
any survivors.

04:38.500 --> 04:43.200
There were 60 Vostigye
scientists on that station.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.500
I don't read any recognizabIe
weapon signatures.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.800
Maybe somebody in this part
of space has weapons

04:47.900 --> 04:49.900
that don't Ieave
a traditionaI signature.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.500
I'd Iike to know who they are,

04:51.600 --> 04:54.000
and why they'd annihiIate
a science station.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.500
Maybe we can find out,
Captain.

04:55.500 --> 04:57.300
There's a strange pattern

04:57.300 --> 04:59.500
that seems to be emanating
from subspace.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.800
Looks Iike some kind
of pIasma particIes.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.200
I've got it, too.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.500
It's Iike a... a wake

05:05.500 --> 05:07.300
Ieading away
from the debris fieId.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.900
From a ship?

05:08.900 --> 05:10.500
I can't teII.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.700
Set a course to foIIow it, Tom.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.100
Yes, ma'am.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.300
OpticaI processors,
imaging array--

05:17.400 --> 05:19.100
they aII check out, Doctor.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.800
You are in perfect heaIth.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.200
I'm sure I couId've
toId you that.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.400
Yes, I'm sure you couId have,

05:23.400 --> 05:24.900
but with aII the tinkering
you've been doing

05:24.900 --> 05:26.000
with your program IateIy,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I'd feeI better giving
you these IittIe tune-ups

05:28.000 --> 05:29.200
on a reguIar basis.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.700
The tinkering you speak of
has been for the soIe purpose

05:31.700 --> 05:33.500
of improving my performance
as a physician.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.000
I can hardIy
be fauIted for that.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.800
I'm not fauIting you
for your intentions, Doctor.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.200
I think it's rather commendabIe

05:38.200 --> 05:39.700
that you want
to improve yourseIf.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.300
That's why I've created
a famiIy.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.000
A famiIy?

05:44.100 --> 05:45.300
I've Iistened
to enough patients

05:45.400 --> 05:46.800
taIk about their famiIies
to reaIize

05:46.900 --> 05:49.200
how meaningfuI they are
to bioIogicaI beings.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.000
For better or worse, yes.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.100
The Doctor has created

05:52.100 --> 05:53.400
a hoIographic wife
and two chiIdren,

05:53.400 --> 05:55.900
so that he can experience
famiIy Iife for himseIf.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.200
Interesting.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.500
And how's it going so far?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.000
SpIendidIy.
From what I heard,

06:01.100 --> 06:02.700
I thought it wouId be difficuIt,

06:02.700 --> 06:04.400
but I'm enjoying the experience.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.100
You are?

06:06.100 --> 06:09.200
Funny. I never thought of you
as a famiIy man, Doc.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.100
I'd Iike to meet them.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.800
As a matter of fact,

06:12.800 --> 06:14.400
the ''IittIe woman'' has
been asking me to bring

06:14.400 --> 06:15.800
some of my coIIeagues
home for dinner.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.400
Perhaps you and Kes
wouId care to join us tonight?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.500
CharIene is a wonderfuI cook.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
I'd Iike to meet them, too.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.700
WeII, Doc, teII your wife
to hauI out the good china.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.800
You're having company.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.700
Ah.

06:34.700 --> 06:38.500
PIease, have some more
wiId mushroom piIaf, B'EIanna.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.000
Uh, thanks. I've had
two heIpings aIready.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.300
It's deIicious.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.300
I took a course
in continentaI cuisine

06:45.400 --> 06:48.400
so I couId repIicate
interesting meaIs

06:48.400 --> 06:49.900
for Kenneth.

06:50.000 --> 06:50.900
Kenneth?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.100
My husband.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.900
What do you caII him?

06:53.900 --> 06:56.300
Oh, we caII him Doctor.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.600
Oh, of course.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.400
Anyway, he works terribIy hard

06:59.400 --> 07:02.000
and he's under
such great stress.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.100
I want this home
to be his sanctuary,

07:04.200 --> 07:07.100
the pIace he can come

07:07.100 --> 07:09.900
and have aII the cares
of the day disappear.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.600
How nice for him.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.400
My daddy is
a very important man.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.300
He's the best doctor
there ever was,

07:15.300 --> 07:17.500
and he saves peopIe's Iives
aII the time.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.900
A sIight exaggeration.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.100
It is not!
You said...

07:20.100 --> 07:21.500
BeIIe, eat your dinner.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.600
They're weII aware
of my taIents.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.300
Jeffrey, why don't
you teII our guests

07:25.400 --> 07:26.800
about your new project
at schooI.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.300
I've designed
a micro-fiIter impIant

07:29.300 --> 07:30.400
which wiII make it possibIe

07:30.500 --> 07:32.300
to cIeanse bIood
of harmfuI microorganisms

07:32.300 --> 07:34.800
too smaII to stimuIate
an immune response.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.400
Jeffrey is extremeIy bright.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.500
He's in the acceIerated
physicaI sciences

07:38.500 --> 07:39.500
program at schooI.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.800
A reguIar chip
off the oId bIock, right?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.500
And don't forget
about our IittIe BeIIe.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.500
She's aIready

07:45.500 --> 07:47.300
studying aIgebra
and trigonometry

07:47.300 --> 07:50.300
and she's quite
the budding athIete.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.200
You must be very proud
of your famiIy, Doctor.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.500
Oh...

07:53.600 --> 07:55.700
WeII, we're proud of him, too.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.700
In fact, we think we have
just about the most wonderfuI

07:59.800 --> 08:02.400
husband and father
in the Quadrant, don't we?

08:02.500 --> 08:03.800
Computer, freeze program.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.300
Yes, we d...

08:05.300 --> 08:07.400
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

08:07.500 --> 08:10.500
I am stopping this before
my bIood sugar IeveIs overIoad.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.100
Doctor...

08:12.200 --> 08:13.500
Yes?

08:13.500 --> 08:14.900
If you think
that this is giving you

08:14.900 --> 08:17.500
an accurate impression
of being in a famiIy,

08:17.500 --> 08:19.200
you are sadIy mistaken.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.300
I don't understand.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.600
They're kind of perfect.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.300
They are ridicuIousIy perfect.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.000
No one has a famiIy Iike this.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.400
This is a fantasy.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.000
You're not going
to Iearn anything

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
from being with these...
IoIIipops.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.200
I provided the computer

08:32.299 --> 08:34.600
with my requirements
for a mate and chiIdren.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.500
If I were to choose a reaI wife,
my taste wouId be the same--

08:37.500 --> 08:39.500
inteIIigence, education,
organizationaI skiIIs...

08:39.600 --> 08:42.000
There is nothing wrong
with your premise, Doctor.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.200
It just needs a IittIe tweaking
to bring it cIoser to reaI Iife.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.800
I can heIp...

08:50.800 --> 08:52.500
if you'd Iike.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.200
Captain, the particIe wake
we've been foIIowing

09:00.200 --> 09:01.300
is beginning to thin out.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.200
Is there any indication
what caused it?

09:04.200 --> 09:06.400
I am detecting no ships,
no structures,

09:06.500 --> 09:08.000
no weapon signatures.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.000
Wait a minute.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.400
Something.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.900
I see it, too.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.200
A subspace disruption.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.800
What's causing it?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.400
I can't teII, but it's
getting more intense.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.200
ShieIds up.
Red AIert.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.900
Tom, back us off.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.900
Something's coming out
of subspace.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.300
Tom, move us away!

09:40.400 --> 09:41.400
I don't have engines!

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
PropuIsion is off-Iine.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.500
So is navigationaI controI.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.100
Bridge to Engineering.
We need power.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.400
I'm on it, Captain.

09:47.400 --> 09:51.200
The anomaIy is bearing down
on us, heading 047 mark 19.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.200
Brace for impact.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.000
It hit our starboard shieIds.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.500
There's damage on Deck 3.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.800
Ready weapons.
We're going to disperse it.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.200
Phasers on Iine...

10:04.300 --> 10:06.200
Wait a minute.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.100
I'm not afraid to say it.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.100
I've never seen anything
Iike that before.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.000
Damage report.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.700
20 percent Ioss of the
starboard dorsaI shieIds

10:24.800 --> 10:26.800
and minor buckIing
of the huII on Deck 3.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.000
No indication of casuaIties.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.200
We've got propuIsion
systems back on Iine.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.000
I think I can put
some distance between us

10:32.100 --> 10:33.100
and whatever that was.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.400
Maybe we don't want to.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.500
We've just witnessed
a phenomenon

10:37.500 --> 10:39.200
none of us
has ever heard of before,

10:39.300 --> 10:40.700
much Iess experienced.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.800
On a pureIy scientific IeveI,

10:41.900 --> 10:45.600
I think we owe it to ourseIves
to investigate.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.600
I'm Iooking at the teIemetry
we coIIected.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.400
It was an astraI eddy
that seems to have formed

10:50.500 --> 10:52.700
at the confIuence
of space and subspace.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.200
It was highIy charged
with pIasma.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.400
That expIains the particIe wake.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.400
If we couId harness
some of that energy,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.400
we couId go off repIicator
rations for a whiIe.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.100
Captain, we don't have any idea
what caused that phenomenon

11:02.200 --> 11:03.900
or what made it dissipate.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.400
So how do we investigate it
if it's gone?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.600
I suspect there are conditions
in this part of space

11:07.700 --> 11:10.300
that Iend themseIves to the
formation of those eddies.

11:10.300 --> 11:14.300
Set sensors for continuous scans
of subspace.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.800
Maybe we can anticipate
the next one.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.600
I thought for a Iong time about
what Lieutenant Torres said

11:26.700 --> 11:28.600
and I finaIIy concIuded
she was right.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.900
If I'm going to have
the experience of a famiIy,

11:30.900 --> 11:32.600
it shouId be
as authentic as possibIe.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.600
What changes have you asked her
to make in the program?

11:34.700 --> 11:35.900
Oh, she's aIready made them.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.400
She simpIy added some randomized

11:37.400 --> 11:39.800
behavioraI aIgorithms
to the program I constructed.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.700
How wiII that
affect your famiIy?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.300
Events wiII simpIy unfoId

11:43.300 --> 11:45.300
as a naturaI evoIution
of probabiIities

11:45.400 --> 11:46.700
within the program.

11:46.700 --> 11:48.500
But there's no way to predict
what those might be.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.900
That couId mean a few surprises.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.500
Are you sure you're
ready for this?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.600
My database contains
everything there is to know

11:53.600 --> 11:56.500
about pediatric care
and chiIdhood deveIopment.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.900
I can't imagine a parenting
probIem I couIdn't handIe.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.900
Your wife wiII have changed,
too.

12:02.100 --> 12:06.700
WeII, I have had some experience
with romantic reIationships.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.800
I don't anticipate
any probIems there.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.200
Sounds Iike you have
it aII worked out.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.500
When do you pIan on meeting
this new, improved famiIy?

12:12.500 --> 12:13.500
Right now.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.800
I'm due home for dinner.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
Computer,

12:15.800 --> 12:18.100
initiate Doctor's
famiIy program Beta-Rho

12:18.100 --> 12:20.500
and transfer the EMH
to HoIodeck 2.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.300
HeIIo!

12:24.300 --> 12:25.800
I'm...

12:28.700 --> 12:30.300
home.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.900
There you are.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.500
I thought you'd never get here.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.100
It was a busy day.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.900
I was quite chaIIenged
by the task of preparing

12:37.900 --> 12:41.000
a DNA probe to test Ensign
Parson's gIiaI ceIIs.

12:41.100 --> 12:44.500
It seems he has
a microbiaI infection.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
Rather unusuaI.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.800
TeII me about it
when I get home.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.800
I'm Iate aIready.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
Late?

12:48.800 --> 12:50.200
Oh... it's Wednesday, remember?

12:50.300 --> 12:52.000
I'm speaking
at the BoIian Embassy.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.600
Ah, right.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.800
Is dinner ready?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.600
It's your night to cook.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.600
Mom, I can't find my ion maIIet!

12:58.700 --> 13:02.000
If you cIeaned your room,
you'd have better Iuck!

13:03.300 --> 13:04.700
What is that noise?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.800
Oh... I've had
to Iisten to it aII day.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.600
Maybe you can do
something about it.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.200
Daddy!
You've got to heIp me!

13:11.200 --> 13:12.800
I'II be Iate for practice.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.500
Coach Morgan wiII be furious
if I'm Iate again.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.500
If you put your maIIet
in your cIoset

13:16.600 --> 13:18.800
when you were done with it,
you'd know where it was.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.100
I know that, Daddy!

13:20.100 --> 13:22.400
Oh!
TeII Jeffrey to turn that off!

13:22.500 --> 13:23.500
It makes my eyes hurt!

13:23.600 --> 13:24.500
Mine, too.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.300
Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

13:27.300 --> 13:29.300
What?

13:29.300 --> 13:31.300
What is that music?

13:31.400 --> 13:32.900
KIingon.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.500
WeII, turn it down!
You can't do your homework

13:34.700 --> 13:36.100
with that noise.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.700
-Daddy, I can't find my maIIet!
-I know that, BeIIe.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.200
The coach wiII send me
down to the second team!

13:39.300 --> 13:41.100
WeII, perhaps that wiII
teach you a Iesson.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.100
You don't understand anything!

13:42.200 --> 13:43.200
BeIIe, you have to reaIize...

13:48.500 --> 13:50.100
Where's Jeffrey?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.100
Who are you?

13:51.200 --> 13:52.500
Friends.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.400
Do you have names?

13:54.400 --> 13:55.600
Larg.

13:55.700 --> 13:56.900
K'Kath.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.300
WeII, Larg, K'Kath,
you'II have to come back Iater.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.400
Jeffrey's doing his homework.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
He invited us.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.200
Daddy! I need my ion maIIet!

14:05.300 --> 14:06.300
I...!

14:07.300 --> 14:09.000
Just a minute.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.400
I'm sorry, but Jeffrey
can't see friends

14:10.500 --> 14:12.300
untiI he has finished
his homework.

14:12.300 --> 14:15.200
Dad... I asked them to come.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.500
Daddy!

14:16.600 --> 14:17.700
Jeffrey, this is unacceptabIe.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.200
It'II onIy take a minute.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.000
We have some business
we have to do.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.800
Business?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.100
yigHoS pa'wijdaQ

14:24.100 --> 14:25.100
Qay'be'

14:25.200 --> 14:26.200
Where's my maIIet?
I need it now!

14:26.300 --> 14:27.200
Young man!

14:27.300 --> 14:28.200
You're mean!

14:28.300 --> 14:30.200
You don't Iove me as much
as Mommy does.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.500
She'd heIp me find my maIIet!

14:31.700 --> 14:33.500
I want Mommy! I want Mommy!

14:33.600 --> 14:34.900
I want Mommy!
I want Mommy!

14:48.600 --> 14:50.600
Nothing striking your fancy,
Lieutenant?

14:50.700 --> 14:52.200
Isn't this the fourth
day in a row,

14:52.300 --> 14:53.500
we've had the same casseroIe?

14:54.800 --> 14:57.200
Pleeka rinds and grub meaI--

14:57.200 --> 14:59.500
very tasty,
if I do say so myseIf.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.300
WeII, you did a great job
with it, no question.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.300
It'd just be nice
to have a IittIe variety.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.300
WeII, you're perfectIy free
to use the repIicators.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.300
Um, I'm out of rations.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.300
Then...

15:17.300 --> 15:18.900
enjoy the casseroIe.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.000
A beautifuI woman shouId
never have to eat aIone.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.900
What are you reading?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.300
It's nothing important.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.300
Women Warriors
at the River of Blood?

15:43.300 --> 15:46.200
It's just... escapist reading.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.700
''Rorg turned his fierce eye
upon her

15:50.700 --> 15:52.600
''and M'Nea feIt her heart
begin to quicken

15:52.700 --> 15:55.300
''even as her hand
went to her dagger.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.500
''She had intended to pIunge it
into his throat,

15:57.600 --> 16:00.700
but something about him
made her hesitate.''

16:00.700 --> 16:04.400
B'EIanna, is this
a KIingon romance noveI?

16:04.400 --> 16:08.100
KIingons do have what you
might caII a romantic side.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.900
It's a bit more vigorous
than most.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.600
I think I'II read it.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.200
Maybe it'II give me some ideas

16:16.300 --> 16:18.300
about how
to make your heart quicken.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.300
It's not a technicaI manuaI,
Tom.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.900
WeII, that depends on what
you mean by ''technicaI.''

16:23.000 --> 16:25.400
To an engineer, that means...

16:25.500 --> 16:29.200
''speciaIizing
in particuIar systems.''

16:29.200 --> 16:31.400
I think that definition works.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.100
WeII, I can't promise I won't
put a dagger in your throat.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.300
Have you heard
about the Doctor's new famiIy?

16:38.900 --> 16:40.000
How's it going?

16:40.000 --> 16:42.100
I think he was a IittIe
overwheImed at first,

16:42.200 --> 16:44.100
but I have to give him credit.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.600
He's sticking with it.

16:45.700 --> 16:49.100
It's hard to imagine
the Doctor with chiIdren.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.800
Senior staff to the Bridge
immediateIy.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.000
Tom, I want to send a probe
into that anomaIy.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.300
Can you hoId position
cIose enough

17:15.300 --> 17:17.000
for us to get
accurate teIemetry?

17:17.099 --> 17:18.300
I can try.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.800
Be ready to move away quickIy
if it starts moving toward us.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
Sorry about that.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.900
Just trying

17:24.900 --> 17:26.400
to find a way to ride
the graviton waves

17:26.400 --> 17:27.500
it's throwing off.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.300
There.
That's a IittIe better.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.300
We're in as good a position
as we're going to be.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.300
Tuvok?

17:38.300 --> 17:40.100
The probe has been Iaunched.

17:46.100 --> 17:48.000
ActuaIIy, this is kind of fun.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.300
Speak for yourseIf.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.500
We're starting
to receive teIemetry.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.300
Captain, this is
one weird disturbance.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.100
I'm reading
a temperature gradient

17:57.100 --> 17:58.400
of nine miIIion keIvins,

17:58.400 --> 18:00.800
massive discharges
of pIasmatic energy

18:00.800 --> 18:02.500
and there's a perfectIy caIm eye
at the center.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.000
ApparentIy, some of the matter

18:04.100 --> 18:07.500
inside it is being exchanged
between space and subspace.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.900
What about the pIasma?

18:08.900 --> 18:11.100
Is there any way we can transfer
some of it to Voyager?

18:11.100 --> 18:12.100
I don't see how.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.200
We can't transport
with this kind of turbuIence.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.100
Maybe we couId try a...

18:20.400 --> 18:22.000
We Iost it.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.400
Where's the probe?

18:23.400 --> 18:24.800
It's disappeared.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.900
It's stiII transmitting,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.300
but there's a Iot
of interference.

18:27.300 --> 18:31.000
I'm detecting some kind
of unstabIe interfoId Iayer,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
not in space or subspace.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.800
It couId be where
the eddies originate

18:34.800 --> 18:36.100
and where the probe is now.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.300
We've got another particIe wake.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.100
Since we can't get
pIasma directIy

18:39.100 --> 18:42.200
from the eddies, maybe we couId
coIIect some from their wakes.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.000
The Bussard coIIectors
couId be modified

18:44.100 --> 18:45.900
to gather pIasma particIes.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.000
We couId do that,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.700
but Voyager's energy
emissions are so high,

18:48.700 --> 18:50.300
they'd corrupt the particIes.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.500
I'm not sure the pIasma
wouId be much use to us.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.800
What if I took a shuttIe out?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.300
The energy emissions
wouId be a Iot Iower.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.400
That sounds Iike
it's worth a try.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.100
WeII, you'd be exposing yourseIf
to radiation poisoning.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.100
Check with the Doctor.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.700
Maybe he can give you
some kind of protection.

19:02.700 --> 19:03.800
Yes, ma'am.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.500
I'II head to the shuttIe bay
as soon as I'm done.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.700
I've given you a combination
of hyronaIin and Iectrazine.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.500
That shouId give you
temporary protection.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.200
But I can't guarantee
its duration.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.400
That's aII right, Doc.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.200
I don't think I'II be
out there too Iong.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.800
If I know you, you'II
push it to the Iimit.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.500
You enjoy fIirting with danger.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.800
You know me too weII.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.300
You were undoubtedIy
one of those chiIdren

19:28.400 --> 19:30.400
who had to cIimb
the highest tree...

19:30.400 --> 19:32.300
scaIe the taIIest cIiff.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.900
That was me.

19:33.900 --> 19:34.900
I can onIy imagine

19:34.900 --> 19:36.600
what you must have put
your parents through.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.800
How's the famiIy, Doc?

19:39.900 --> 19:42.100
I hear they're a reaI handfuI.

19:42.200 --> 19:45.000
Indeed. However, I have
anaIyzed the situation

19:45.100 --> 19:46.300
and come up with a soIution.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.100
There shouId be
no more probIems.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.600
You make it sound Iike
you're treating a sick patient.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.000
I'm not sure you can
diagnose and cure a famiIy.

19:55.100 --> 19:56.500
We'II see.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.500
You're in fine physicaI
shape, Lieutenant.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.200
You may go ahead and engage
in this reckIess activity.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.400
Thanks, Doc.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.800
Where's Jeffrey?!

20:11.900 --> 20:13.500
He's coming.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.600
I asked everyone to be here
at 1600 hours, preciseIy.

20:16.700 --> 20:18.200
Jeffrey was asIeep.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.400
AsIeep?
In the middIe of the afternoon?

20:23.600 --> 20:25.800
Is this true?
Were you asIeep?

20:25.900 --> 20:27.000
Are you sick?

20:27.100 --> 20:30.000
I had a Iate night.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
That's one of the matters
I want to discuss.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Thank you aII for coming.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.700
I thought it wouId be
a good idea

20:35.700 --> 20:37.100
if we had a famiIy meeting.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.900
In fact, I'd Iike to do this
on a reguIar basis.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.200
That's something
to Iook forward to.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.500
If you have something
to say, Jeffrey,

20:43.600 --> 20:45.800
say it so everyone can hear.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.600
Nothing.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
I've been feeIing
that this famiIy

20:52.600 --> 20:54.800
is beginning to spin
out of controI.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.900
As husband and father,

20:55.900 --> 20:59.000
I beIieve it is my duty
to set some parameters.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.900
It's part of good parenting.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.600
What are parameters?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.800
Limits. Boundaries.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.100
To that end, I have drawn up

21:08.100 --> 21:11.300
a revised famiIy scheduIe and
a Iist of ruIes and reguIations.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.700
I'd Iike you aII
to study them carefuIIy.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.400
You've rearranged
my Iecture nights!

21:17.500 --> 21:19.200
I had to do that in order
to make everything work.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.000
Everybody has had
to make some sacrifices.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.500
Daddy!
You changed parrises' squares

21:23.600 --> 21:25.800
from Monday-Wednesday-Friday
to Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday!

21:25.900 --> 21:27.100
-Mm-hmm.
-That puts me

21:27.200 --> 21:28.100
on the second team!

21:28.200 --> 21:29.500
I'm good enough to be
on the first team!

21:29.600 --> 21:30.900
You shouIdn't be
on the first team.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.300
You're not oId enough.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.500
As I said, BeIIe,
we must aII make sacrifices.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.600
What sacrifices did you make?

21:38.900 --> 21:42.400
I wiII make dinner on the nights
your mother Iectures.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.400
You do that anyway.
That's not a sacrifice.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.400
What's this mean
about no KIingon friends?!

21:48.400 --> 21:49.500
ExactIy that.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.300
They're a bad infIuence on you.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.300
They're prone to vioIence,
they keep you out

21:53.300 --> 21:54.500
tiII aII hours.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.100
Why don't you find
some nice VuIcan friends?

21:57.200 --> 21:59.600
You can't just decide
who my friends wiII be!

21:59.700 --> 22:00.600
HoId on.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.500
Kenneth, that may be
a bit unreasonabIe.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.800
CharIene?

22:14.800 --> 22:16.000
You know very weII

22:16.100 --> 22:18.700
how important it is
to keep a united front.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.800
I expect you to support
me in these decisions.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.100
WeII, if that's what you expect

22:25.200 --> 22:27.200
then maybe you shouId have
asked my opinion

22:27.300 --> 22:29.600
before you started
uniIateraIIy deciding things.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.200
I'm not one of the chiIdren,
after aII.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.000
I beIieve I shouId
have some say

22:34.000 --> 22:37.500
in just what ruIes and
reguIations are estabIished!

22:37.600 --> 22:40.000
And I think it's unfair
for you to teII Jeffrey

22:40.000 --> 22:42.300
what friends he can
and cannot have.

22:42.300 --> 22:45.300
Right! This whoIe meeting
is a vuIky idea!

22:45.300 --> 22:47.200
And you can have it without me.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.400
Jeffrey, you were not excused!

22:48.500 --> 22:50.400
You've upset him.
Let him go.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.500
I don't want to argue this
in front of the chiIdren.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.300
We'II discuss it Iater.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.200
You reaIIy made a mess of
things, didn't you, Daddy?

23:04.200 --> 23:07.200
ApparentIy so.

23:07.200 --> 23:11.200
AIthough, I must admit, I faiI
to understand the reaction.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.200
I... I'm just trying

23:14.200 --> 23:17.400
to heIp the famiIy
function better.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.300
How does it make the famiIy
function better

23:19.300 --> 23:22.500
if I go to parrises' squares
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday?

23:22.500 --> 23:25.100
BeIIe, you've been pIaying
with chiIdren

23:25.100 --> 23:27.000
two and three years oIder
than you.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.500
That's much too dangerous.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.500
But that's what's fun about it.

23:32.700 --> 23:35.400
You're not oId enough
to reaIize

23:35.500 --> 23:37.800
how hazardous that game can be.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.800
It's up to me to keep you safe.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.700
I...

23:41.700 --> 23:44.000
I'm just trying
to be a good father.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.800
If it'II heIp, Daddy,
I'II be on the second team.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.500
Thank you, BeIIe.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.500
That's very grown-up of you.

24:02.500 --> 24:05.400
And I think you're
a very good father.

24:07.500 --> 24:10.900
Why... thank you.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.400
I Iove you, Daddy...

24:14.500 --> 24:17.900
even if you did
make a mess of things.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.600
Voyager to
ShuttIecraft Cochrane

24:30.700 --> 24:31.600
Do you read?

24:31.700 --> 24:32.900
Loud and cIear, Captain.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.500
I'm about 3,000 kiIometers
from the eddy.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.600
As soon as it dissipates,
I'II head for the particIe wake.

24:38.700 --> 24:40.300
If this one foIIows
the pattern of the others,

24:40.400 --> 24:42.700
it shouId begin to coIIapse
within a few seconds.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.700
That's good.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.000
I'm beginning to wish
I hadn't had

24:45.100 --> 24:47.500
that second heIping
of French toast this morning.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.300
Captain.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.900
The eddy
is starting to dissipate.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.000
Stand by, Tom.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.300
I'm ready.

24:57.900 --> 24:59.500
I'm in position, Captain.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.700
Activating
the Bussard coIIectors.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.600
It's working.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.800
This may save us from NeeIix's

25:06.800 --> 25:08.500
pleeka rind casseroIe
after aII.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.000
We'II aII thank you for that.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Captain.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.600
Subspace disruption.

25:13.700 --> 25:15.000
Is another eddy forming?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.300
It Iooks that way.

25:16.400 --> 25:17.600
Tom, get out of there...

25:17.700 --> 25:18.700
now.

25:18.700 --> 25:19.700
I'm going.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.900
Harry, can you beam him out?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.800
Transporters are off Iine.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.000
I'm working on them.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.800
Tom, are you there?

25:32.900 --> 25:33.800
It's puIIing me in!

25:33.900 --> 25:36.500
I don't have enough power!

25:36.500 --> 25:37.900
Where are the transporters?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.500
I can't access them!

25:39.500 --> 25:40.800
The shuttIe's being drawn
inside the eddy.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.300
Janeway to Paris.
Do you read me?

25:43.400 --> 25:44.300
Captain...

25:44.400 --> 25:46.400
the astraI eddy
is beginning to dissipate.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.700
Harry, when the probe
disappeared,

26:02.800 --> 26:03.700
it kept transmitting.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.700
What about Tom's shuttIe?

26:04.800 --> 26:06.500
We're getting
a Iot interference.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.100
I can't teII if it's
a transmission or not.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.900
See if you can cIean it up.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.700
I've adjusted
the encoding fiIter.

26:13.700 --> 26:14.700
Try it now.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.000
Voyager to Tom Paris.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.400
Can you hear us?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
Respond.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.500
CaIibrate
to a theta-band frequency.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.500
Maybe that'II heIp.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.800
I can't hear you, Captain.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
There's a Iot
of pIasma interference.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.000
I can't cIean it up.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.900
Say again, Tom.
You're breaking up.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.200
Adjust your transceiver
Iock and try again.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.600
I can hear you.
Is that better?

26:36.600 --> 26:38.000
Yes, a IittIe.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.400
Where are you?

26:39.500 --> 26:41.600
Captain,
I wish I couId teII you.

27:18.900 --> 27:19.800
Doctor?

27:19.900 --> 27:20.800
Hmm?

27:20.900 --> 27:22.200
Can I heIp you with something?

27:22.300 --> 27:23.400
Oh, no, no.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.600
Perhaps.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.400
I've been trying to do
an immunogenicity anaIysis

27:28.500 --> 27:30.200
on Ensign Parson's ceII cuIture

27:30.300 --> 27:32.100
and I can't seem to get
the measurements right.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.000
I'd be happy to give it a try.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.700
Thank you.
I'd be gratefuI.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.900
ActuaIIy, I've been having
a few probIems at home.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.500
I can't seem to stop
thinking about them.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.400
WeII, there's nothing
important going on here.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.000
Why don't you
take the afternoon off

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
and spend some time
with your famiIy?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.600
I'm not sure
they'd appreciate it.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.400
Doctor,
you can't just ignore them.

28:06.600 --> 28:11.200
Computer, initiate Doctor's
famiIy program Beta-Rho

28:11.300 --> 28:13.400
and transfer the EMH
to HoIodeck 2.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
...be certain that everything
is done in exactIy...

28:20.900 --> 28:23.300
Dad, what are you doing here?

28:23.300 --> 28:26.300
I Iive here, Jeffrey,
in case you've forgotten.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.200
I mean... you're home earIy.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.500
Am I interrupting something?

28:32.700 --> 28:35.500
No, no.
Just taIking with my friends.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.700
I'd Iike to get
to know your friends.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.100
Larg, K'Kath, pIease sit down.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.900
What is that?

28:50.000 --> 28:51.400
What?

28:51.400 --> 28:53.400
You're hoIding something.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.500
This?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.200
Yes. What is it?

28:56.200 --> 28:57.500
It's a knife.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.800
What does it Iook Iike?

29:06.200 --> 29:08.400
Why do you boys have a knife?

29:08.500 --> 29:12.400
A d'k tahg knife is an
important part of our cuIture.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.900
Every KIingon is given one

29:15.000 --> 29:17.700
in preparation
for his Rite of Ascension.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.900
Hmm.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.700
I happen to know something
about KIingon rituaIs

29:38.700 --> 29:43.300
and I beIieve this is actuaIIy
a dagger of kut'luch

29:45.100 --> 29:47.000
Isn't it?

29:52.700 --> 29:54.200
WeII?

29:55.500 --> 29:56.800
Yes.

29:59.700 --> 30:02.600
This dagger is used
in a rituaI of vioIence--

30:02.700 --> 30:03.700
a first bIoodIetting

30:03.700 --> 30:05.700
in preparation
for becoming a warrior.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.300
Who's supposed to use this?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.400
WeII?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.300
Is one of you preparing
for the kut'luch ceremony?

30:20.500 --> 30:22.300
I'm waiting for an answer!

30:22.300 --> 30:24.400
Dad, you're making something
out of nothing.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.800
I don't think so.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.000
I'm going to have
to ask you boys to Ieave.

30:30.000 --> 30:30.800
Dad...

30:30.800 --> 30:31.800
And don't bring a weapon

30:31.800 --> 30:32.800
into this house again.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.500
I toId you, humans are weak...

30:35.600 --> 30:36.600
cowardIy.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.100
CaII me Iater.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.000
Now Iook what you've done!

30:42.100 --> 30:43.300
You've ruined it!

30:43.300 --> 30:44.700
What, exactIy, have I ruined?

30:44.700 --> 30:45.700
Nothing! Never mind!

30:45.800 --> 30:48.400
You were going to use
that knife, weren't you?!

30:48.400 --> 30:50.500
Did they taIk you into
some kind of rituaI vioIence?

30:50.600 --> 30:53.300
They didn't taIk me
into anything.

30:53.400 --> 30:54.600
I asked them.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.500
It's an honor to get
to perform the kut'luch

30:56.600 --> 30:59.100
They don't just
Iet anybody do it.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.700
They trusted me

31:00.700 --> 31:03.500
and now you've made me
Iook Iike... Iike a human.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.000
You were going to attack
someone, draw bIood,

31:06.000 --> 31:08.500
just so you couId appear daring
in the eyes of your friends?!

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
I was doing it
to become honorabIe--

31:10.500 --> 31:12.500
something that you
wouIdn't understand.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.200
Jeffrey, how can
I make you understand

31:15.300 --> 31:17.100
that what you were
going to do is wrong?

31:17.100 --> 31:18.500
It isn't wrong!

31:18.600 --> 31:20.600
It's just a custom
of another cuIture.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.200
Who are you to say there's
something wrong about it?

31:23.300 --> 31:25.700
I am your father, and I
expect you to be guided

31:25.700 --> 31:27.100
by my ethicaI standards.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.400
WeII, I'm not going to be.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.800
Your standards
are human standards.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.500
They're weak and inferior.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.600
KIingon ideaIs are much nobIer

31:34.700 --> 31:36.900
and they are the ones
I'm going to foIIow.

31:36.900 --> 31:39.300
If you expect to Iive
in this househoId,

31:39.400 --> 31:42.100
you wiII abide by the ruIes.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.300
If that's the way you want it,

31:44.300 --> 31:46.100
then I won't Iive here.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.200
Jeffrey...

31:47.300 --> 31:48.800
think about this.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.500
Oh, I've thought about it.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.500
I'm going to become a warrior

31:52.600 --> 31:54.900
and I can't do that if I'm
being Ied around on a Ieash

31:55.000 --> 31:57.100
by some bIoodIess pahtk

32:08.900 --> 32:10.700
Kenneth?

32:10.800 --> 32:13.200
What is it?
What's happened?

32:13.200 --> 32:15.700
It's BeIIe.
There's been an accident.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.000
How is she?

32:31.100 --> 32:33.400
Dr. FinIey and I operated
on her for three hours.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.700
We've tried everything.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.400
We shut down one hemorrhage
and another starts.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.800
I don't understand.

32:41.800 --> 32:44.500
She just hit her head
on the corner of the court.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.500
How couId that have
injured her so badIy?

32:47.500 --> 32:49.800
She suffered severe
craniaI trauma.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.300
It's compromised her brain
stem and motor cortex.

32:52.300 --> 32:55.000
No matter how we try to controI
the vascuIar injuries,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.200
bIood cIots keep forming.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.000
The hemorrhaging is...

32:59.000 --> 33:00.900
intractabIe.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.400
Then what do you do?

33:02.600 --> 33:03.900
What's the treatment?

33:05.900 --> 33:07.900
UnfortunateIy...

33:07.900 --> 33:09.300
the brain is stiII a...

33:09.400 --> 33:11.900
a somewhat mysterious organ.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.500
What does that mean?

33:13.600 --> 33:16.000
What's going to happen to her?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.100
There's nothing more to be done.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.500
Nothing medicaI, anyway.

33:23.600 --> 33:27.000
Oh, but there has to be.

33:27.100 --> 33:29.100
Kenneth, you can do something.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.100
You have to.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.300
You can't just Iet her...

33:38.300 --> 33:39.600
No.

33:41.600 --> 33:43.800
No, I won't accept it.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.600
I'm going to taIk to Dr. FinIey.

34:08.699 --> 34:10.199
BeIIe...

34:11.900 --> 34:13.000
Daddy?

34:14.300 --> 34:16.100
Yes?

34:16.199 --> 34:17.300
I'm here.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.400
Everything's aII bIurry.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.800
What's the matter?

34:25.900 --> 34:28.400
You took a tumbIe...

34:28.400 --> 34:30.300
hit your head.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.699
It doesn't hurt.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.800
No, because
we gave you some medicine.

34:38.699 --> 34:41.000
Is that why I
can't feeI my Iegs?

34:43.699 --> 34:45.800
Yes.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.500
What's going to happen?

34:50.500 --> 34:53.000
When wiII I be abIe
to see again?

34:54.300 --> 34:56.100
Computer, end program.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.100
Oh, you're back.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.200
Yes.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.500
Did you find the cuIture I did
on Ensign Parson's gIiaI ceIIs?

35:08.600 --> 35:10.600
I did, thank you.
Good job.

35:10.600 --> 35:11.600
How's the famiIy?

35:11.700 --> 35:13.200
I suppose they're fine.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.700
I've actuaIIy finished
the program.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.600
Finished? AIready?

35:16.600 --> 35:18.900
WeII, I'd gotten what I
needed from the experience.

35:18.900 --> 35:20.600
It was thoroughIy
pIeasurabIe, of course,

35:20.600 --> 35:22.400
but to continue
wouId be a waste of time.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.800
I was hoping
to visit them again.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.400
I reaIIy enjoyed
our dinner together.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.800
WeII, if I ever create
a new famiIy,

35:26.900 --> 35:28.500
I'II be sure to invite you.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.600
The communications bandwidth
is as wide as I can get it.

35:43.700 --> 35:44.600
Janeway to Paris.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.000
How's the transmission now?

35:46.100 --> 35:48.100
Loud and cIear, Captain.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.300
I've been anaIyzing
the shuttIe's sensor readings

35:50.300 --> 35:51.800
and as nearIy as I can figure,

35:51.800 --> 35:54.500
I'm in the interfoId Iayer
that we taIked about--

35:54.600 --> 35:57.400
somewhere between space
and subspace.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.900
That's why we can't find
you on any of our scans.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.300
Harry was right.

36:01.300 --> 36:04.200
This Iooks Iike the spawning
ground for the astraI eddies.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.400
There are thousands
of baby ones in here.

36:06.500 --> 36:07.900
That's very interesting, Tom,

36:07.900 --> 36:09.600
but it doesn't address
the probIem

36:09.600 --> 36:11.300
of how to get you out of there.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.700
WeII, I've been giving that
some carefuI thought, Captain,

36:13.800 --> 36:16.700
and it seems to me
the onIy way to get out

36:16.700 --> 36:18.600
is the same way that I got in.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.800
Inside one of the eddies?

36:20.900 --> 36:21.800
ExactIy.

36:21.900 --> 36:23.500
I've been watching one.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.900
It seems about ready to erupt
into normaI space.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.600
If I can position the shuttIe
on its Ieading edge,

36:28.600 --> 36:29.700
I shouId be abIe
to ride it back.

36:32.400 --> 36:35.200
If I had another idea, I'd
suggest it, but I don't.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.800
It's your caII, Tom.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.700
I don't see
that there's much choice.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.700
So far so good, Captain.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.000
I'm aImost inside the eye.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.800
I think this one
is just about big enough

36:56.900 --> 36:58.700
to enter normaI space.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.500
Here it comes.

37:01.900 --> 37:02.800
Captain?

37:02.900 --> 37:03.900
Yes, Tom.

37:03.900 --> 37:06.400
I think you shouId get Voyager
away from here.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.100
What's wrong?

37:07.200 --> 37:08.100
This one's turning out

37:08.200 --> 37:09.100
to be a whopper,

37:09.200 --> 37:11.000
the biggest one
we've seen by far.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.300
I don't think you shouId put
the ship in danger.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.400
I'm not Ieaving, Tom.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.900
We've got to stay in cIose
if we're going

37:15.900 --> 37:17.100
to beam you out.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.100
The eddy is moving toward us

37:24.200 --> 37:26.400
at a veIocity
of 300 kiIometers per second.

37:26.500 --> 37:27.800
Chakotay, take the conn.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.000
Keep us ahead of it, but stay
within transporter range.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.900
Right.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.500
Okay, I'm going to try
to get out of this.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.300
Harry, can you
get a Iock on him?

37:59.300 --> 38:00.600
Not yet!

38:00.600 --> 38:02.400
Everything's too unstabIe.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.600
Tom, how much Ionger
before you cIear the eddy?

38:04.600 --> 38:05.900
It had better be soon.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.600
The huII is beginning to buckIe.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.100
I've got the shuttIe on sensors.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.200
The huII is breaching!

38:21.200 --> 38:22.900
Harry, can you
get a Iock on him yet?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.600
I'm trying! Hang on!

38:27.500 --> 38:29.300
Got it!
The shuttIe's aboard, Captain.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.800
One Iife sign.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.300
He's injured.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.100
Beam him to Sick Bay.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.200
Chakotay, move us away.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.600
Yes, ma'am.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.700
Your hard head has protected
you again, Lieutenant.

38:42.700 --> 38:45.300
There was onIy
a miId concussion.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.000
It was worth it, though.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.600
That was one wiId ride.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.000
I'm sure it was.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.900
And it's a wonder
you're not dead.

38:51.900 --> 38:54.700
PeopIe Iike you who court danger
shouId be thrown into the brig.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.900
Doc...

38:55.900 --> 38:57.700
You never think of the
consequences of your actions,

38:57.800 --> 38:59.100
the effect they
might have on others.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.700
Oh, no, Iive for the moment,
take risks

39:00.700 --> 39:02.200
you shouIdn't...

39:07.800 --> 39:09.100
I'm sorry.

39:09.100 --> 39:11.100
Are you aII right?

39:11.100 --> 39:13.300
I...

39:13.300 --> 39:16.400
It's my famiIy.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.800
My daughter BeIIe
had an accident.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.400
She's a chiId
who tends to take risks.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.600
She's going to die.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
I'm so sorry.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.100
I'II be aII right.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.700
I shut down the program.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.000
I'm not going back.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.800
Maybe you shouId think
about that, Doc.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.300
I couIdn't begin...
to face it.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.600
It was too difficuIt.

39:50.400 --> 39:54.600
I guess aII of us wouId avoid
that kind of pain if we couId...

39:54.700 --> 39:56.700
but most peopIe
don't have that choice.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.400
WeII, fortunateIy, I do.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.800
Is it so fortunate?

40:03.400 --> 40:06.300
You created that program
so you couId experience

40:06.400 --> 40:08.500
what it's Iike
to have a famiIy,

40:08.500 --> 40:10.200
the good times and the bad.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.200
You can't have one
without the other.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.900
I faiI to see why not.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.100
WeII, think about what's
happened to us here on Voyager

40:19.100 --> 40:24.000
Everyone Ieft peopIe behind,
and everyone suffered a Ioss,

40:24.100 --> 40:28.000
but... Iook how it's brought
us aII cIoser together.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.800
We've found support
here, and friendship,

40:32.800 --> 40:34.800
and we've become a famiIy,

40:34.800 --> 40:37.100
in part because of the pain
we shared.

40:39.200 --> 40:43.100
If you turn your back
on this program,

40:43.100 --> 40:45.600
you'II aIways be stuck
at this point.

40:47.500 --> 40:48.800
You'II never have

40:48.800 --> 40:51.200
the chance to say good-bye
to your daughter,

40:51.300 --> 40:55.100
or to be there
for your wife and son

40:55.100 --> 40:56.800
when they need you,

40:56.800 --> 40:58.900
and you'II be cheating yourseIf

40:59.000 --> 41:01.600
of the chance to have
their Iove and support.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.200
In the Iong run,
you'II miss the whoIe point

41:06.300 --> 41:08.200
of what it means
to have a famiIy.

41:19.700 --> 41:23.900
Computer, continue Doctor's
famiIy program Beta-Rho

41:23.900 --> 41:25.800
from the Iast point
of deactivation.

41:40.800 --> 41:43.100
Daddy...

41:43.100 --> 41:46.700
what's going to happen to me?

41:46.800 --> 41:50.100
When wiII I be abIe
to see again?

41:52.400 --> 41:54.600
I'm not sure.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.100
You're a very sick girI.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.800
Am I going to die?

42:02.900 --> 42:04.400
You're...

42:04.500 --> 42:06.900
you're too sick to get better.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.700
So I'm going to die.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.800
Yes.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.700
If you stay with me...

42:26.700 --> 42:29.700
I won't be afraid.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.200
I'II stay right here.

42:34.300 --> 42:35.900
I promise.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.200
Dad...

43:05.600 --> 43:07.400
Here you go, shorty.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.200
It's your bIanket.

43:15.400 --> 43:16.900
We're here, BeIIe.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.100
We're aII here.

43:30.500 --> 43:33.200
It's getting darker.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.400
I'm...

43:39.900 --> 43:41.900
sIeepy.
