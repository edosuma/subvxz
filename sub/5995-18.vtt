00:01.102 --> 00:02.270
Previously
 on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.303 --> 00:04.772
If you're getting your butterfly
smashed, I am all for it.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.575
As long as it's not Greg.
Oh...

00:07.608 --> 00:09.577
PAULA: He is Josh's best friend,
 okay, and if you sleep

00:09.610 --> 00:11.312
with Josh's best friend,
that ruins any possibility

00:11.345 --> 00:13.447
for when you finally come
to your senses and realize

00:13.481 --> 00:14.615
that you were
meant for Josh.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.716
Why does Rebecca like him?

00:15.749 --> 00:17.085
Why is she all
buddy-buddy with him?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.486
He's just a stupid know-it-all.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.587
You're sleeping
with Rebecca.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.055
All the time. A lot.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.224
It's Greg?
You're sleeping with Greg?

00:23.257 --> 00:25.793
How could you?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.562
*

00:32.633 --> 00:34.802
So you're galloping through
the forest looking for me,

00:34.835 --> 00:37.405
'cause I was stolen
by the evil witch,

00:37.438 --> 00:40.741
and you finally find me
in the enchanted woods.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.243
You gasp!

00:43.644 --> 00:45.613
You know, gasp?

00:45.646 --> 00:46.747
Just go like this.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.748
(gasps)

00:47.781 --> 00:49.150
This is boring, Rebecca.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.684
Why can't we play
with my trucks?

00:50.718 --> 00:51.685
Shh!

00:51.719 --> 00:54.088
Jake, you're not getting this.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.224
When we see each other,
the spell is lifted,

00:56.257 --> 00:57.758
and a song plays.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.228
I'm thinking that great song

01:00.261 --> 01:01.629
from the movie Slumbered.

01:01.662 --> 01:02.763
Do you know it?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.798
It goes like this...

01:04.831 --> 01:09.570
* In one indescribable instant

01:09.603 --> 01:14.108
* The whole world
falls away... *

01:14.142 --> 01:15.243
No way. I'm not doing this.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.577
What? Come on.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.645
With that attitude,

01:17.678 --> 01:20.248
you're never gonna be
anyone's Prince Charming,

01:20.281 --> 01:23.151
while I'm gonna have
a great love story.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.587
GREG:
Wow.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.790
So Paula was pretty pissed
when she walked out of here.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.726
Yeah, I don't... I don't know
what her problem is.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.829
You feeling better, Bunch?

01:35.863 --> 01:36.764
Yeah.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.834
Hey, I'm sorry I...

01:40.868 --> 01:42.536
ruined your hot date.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.872
What? Nah, I left as soon
as you texted me.

01:44.905 --> 01:45.839
Actually,
I never wanted

01:45.873 --> 01:49.143
to be there to begin with.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.611
I should've said that
right off the bat.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.414
Yeah, you should've.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.815
What about your hot dates
next week?

01:54.848 --> 01:55.816
You have, like, eight.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.418
I made those up.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.586
Those were fake.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.887
All eight of them?

02:01.522 --> 02:03.157
Get out.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.192
It is my turn now.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.693
I have calmed down,

02:05.726 --> 02:06.827
I am ready to
speak to Rebecca,

02:06.860 --> 02:08.162
so get out.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.163
Don't worry.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.764
Stepping out.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.735
*

02:18.939 --> 02:21.575
I asked you a million times
who you were sleeping with,

02:21.609 --> 02:23.311
and you lied to me.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.145
And with Greg Serrano,
of all people.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.848
After everything I've done
for your love story,

02:27.881 --> 02:30.318
to get you together with
Josh Chan, and you betray me

02:30.351 --> 02:32.320
by picking

02:32.353 --> 02:35.489
sarcastic, alcoholic,
unromantic Greg?

02:35.523 --> 02:36.857
(exhales)

02:36.890 --> 02:39.193
Whoa.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.361
Why are you still here?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.731
What... Did you bring
her flowers?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.866
Um, she's my friend,
she's in the hospital.

02:45.899 --> 02:46.867
That's what you do.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.269
What is that?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.471
You-you bought her
a stupid balloon?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.472
No, no. No.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.773
This balloon is not stupid.

02:52.806 --> 02:53.841
It's genius.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.544
The Messiah is riding
a unicorn over a rainbow.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.613
It's like the turducken
of sympathy balloons.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.215
What are you
even doing here?

03:01.249 --> 03:03.351
I said, I'm-I'm checking up
on her.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.619
Dude, I know you two had

03:05.653 --> 03:07.421
a kind of momentary
tongue connection,

03:07.455 --> 03:09.423
but Rebecca isn't
into you anymore.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.959
She's... with me now.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.663
So maybe you should
take those flowers

03:15.696 --> 03:16.797
back to your girlfriend,

03:16.830 --> 03:19.900
who you haven't been able to
commit to for over 15 years.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.769
Oh, don't turn this
around on me.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.903
This is not about
me and Valencia.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.272
Oh, okay. Sure.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.378
Fine, you give Rebecca
these for me.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.380
But get used to me
being her friend,

03:32.413 --> 03:33.981
because Rebecca and I are close.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.983
There's nothing you
can do about that.

03:36.016 --> 03:36.817
She and I have a history,

03:36.850 --> 03:39.253
and whether
you're with her or not,

03:39.287 --> 03:40.821
we're connected.

03:40.854 --> 03:41.822
Oh, uh-huh?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.291
Well, doesn't bother me

03:43.324 --> 03:44.658
and I don't care

03:44.692 --> 03:46.260
and it doesn't bother me,

03:46.294 --> 03:47.795
also a weird thing to say,

03:47.828 --> 03:49.263
and it doesn't bother me.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.832
Also, circling back,
you have a girlfriend.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.537
Say hi to your
very patient girlfriend!

03:56.570 --> 03:57.738
(sighs)

03:57.771 --> 04:00.741
Do you have any idea the things
that I have done for you?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.743
I have devoted my life to you.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.278
You have no idea

04:04.312 --> 04:06.280
the lengths that
I have gone to.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.881
Take Thanksgiving,
for example...

04:07.915 --> 04:09.950
You got me invited
to Josh's house, okay.
Yes.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.985
How did I do that?

04:12.019 --> 04:13.887
How did you just magically

04:13.921 --> 04:15.756
bump into Josh's mother
at the market?

04:15.789 --> 04:17.425
Huh? Huh?

04:17.458 --> 04:18.759
I don't know.

04:18.791 --> 04:21.295
Rebecca, under
Lourdes Chan's car

04:21.329 --> 04:22.496
is a tracking device
that is keyed

04:22.530 --> 04:24.765
into a beeper
in my desk at the office.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.634
I had to smuggle
that device in from Armenia.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.469
I know where that woman is
every hour of every day.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.337
Whoa.
Yeah.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.004
And that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.005
I have done things for you

04:32.039 --> 04:34.007
that you can't
even imagine,

04:34.041 --> 04:35.042
things that would
make your head spin.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.577
And I did it for you.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.012
No, no, I didn't ask you
to do any of those things.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.981
Don't talk anymore!

04:41.014 --> 04:44.718
(low strings begin playing)
Paula?
What are you doing?

04:44.752 --> 04:45.953
Paula, why are you
shutting the doctors out?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.723
* Time for you to shut up!

04:49.757 --> 04:51.024
(orchestral sting)

04:51.058 --> 04:53.026
* Time for you to sit down!

04:53.060 --> 04:53.861
(orchestral sting)

04:53.894 --> 04:55.062
* Paula's tired

04:55.095 --> 04:56.597
* Of being your sidekick

04:56.630 --> 04:57.665
* Your henchman

04:57.698 --> 04:58.866
* Your eager

04:58.899 --> 05:01.669
(orchestral sting)
* Little

05:01.702 --> 05:06.574
* Clown

05:11.078 --> 05:14.615
* After everything
I've done for you... *

05:14.648 --> 05:16.617
* That I didn't ask for!

05:16.650 --> 05:21.021
* Do you have any idea
the work you're undoing? *

05:21.054 --> 05:24.358
* After everything
I've done for you *

05:24.392 --> 05:26.427
* That you didn't ask for

05:26.460 --> 05:30.398
* Let's just say Greg isn't
the only one you're screwing *

05:30.431 --> 05:34.535
Want to know all the things
I've done for you?

05:34.568 --> 05:36.370
* I broke into
Josh's old high school *

05:36.404 --> 05:38.906
* And made copies
of all his grades *

05:38.939 --> 05:41.041
* I "bumped into" Lourdes
at Starbucks *

05:41.074 --> 05:43.911
* And suggested
you be a bridesmaid *

05:43.944 --> 05:46.113
* I blackmailed
Valencia's boss *

05:46.146 --> 05:49.049
* So now I control
when she teaches *

05:49.082 --> 05:51.819
* That's right,
I make yoga class schedules *

05:51.852 --> 05:54.422
* There's no limit
to where my reach is *

05:54.455 --> 05:56.557
*

05:56.590 --> 05:59.393
* After everything
I've done for you *

05:59.427 --> 06:02.396
* That you didn't ask for

06:02.430 --> 06:06.066
* God! Will your lies
never end? *

06:06.099 --> 06:09.437
* After everything
I've done for you *

06:09.470 --> 06:12.005
* That you didn't ask for

06:12.039 --> 06:15.142
* The least you can do
is be honest with your mother *

06:15.175 --> 06:17.144
* I mean, friend

06:19.580 --> 06:21.482
* What's that look
on your face? *

06:21.515 --> 06:23.484
* You're horrified

06:23.517 --> 06:25.453
* You think I'm a monster

06:25.486 --> 06:28.456
* For doing your dirty work

06:29.857 --> 06:32.092
* You think love is stainless
and pure *

06:32.125 --> 06:34.495
* But beneath all the fantasy

06:34.528 --> 06:39.433
* There's filth
and there's gore *

06:39.467 --> 06:42.102
* So now it's

06:42.135 --> 06:43.971
* Time for me to walk out

06:44.004 --> 06:45.439
(orchestral sting)

06:45.473 --> 06:47.841
* Time for me to say no!

06:47.875 --> 06:51.445
* Paula's tired of working
for no thanks at all *

06:51.479 --> 06:52.446
* Paula's

06:52.480 --> 06:53.447
(orchestral sting)

06:53.481 --> 06:54.448
* Gonna

06:54.482 --> 06:55.449
(orchestral sting)

06:55.483 --> 06:59.487
* Go...

06:59.520 --> 07:02.456
* You're nothing without me

07:02.490 --> 07:05.158
* And my creativity

07:05.192 --> 07:06.727
* I created you

07:06.760 --> 07:08.028
* You lived in my womb

07:08.061 --> 07:09.997
* I mean, figuratively

07:10.030 --> 07:13.000
* After everything
I've done for you *

07:13.033 --> 07:15.769
* I don't, I don't,
I don't know why *

07:15.803 --> 07:17.538
* So now

07:17.571 --> 07:20.140
* I'm gonna say

07:20.173 --> 07:28.749
* Good-bye!

07:28.782 --> 07:30.784
(panting)

07:34.922 --> 07:37.491
If you think you're over Josh,

07:37.525 --> 07:39.793
you are fooling yourself.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.544
The other balloon options were

07:56.577 --> 07:58.812
"It's a Boy"
or "Suck It, Cancer."

07:58.846 --> 08:01.148
You wouldn't have
preferred flowers, would you?

08:01.181 --> 08:02.616
What? No. No. I love flowers

08:02.650 --> 08:04.217
and I love
ironic stick balloons.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.218
I love them both.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.720
Right, but you must love one

08:06.754 --> 08:08.221
more than the other,
though, right?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.691
I mean, maybe you love
stick balloons a little bit,

08:10.724 --> 08:12.626
because you think they're
funny and charming, kind of,

08:12.660 --> 08:14.595
in an, uh, unthreatening way.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.230
But flowers, you, like, love,
'cause they hold

08:17.264 --> 08:19.733
a special place in your heart
and have been there forever,

08:19.767 --> 08:21.735
and stick balloons
should just give up

08:21.769 --> 08:22.870
because he's wasting his time?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.772
Hey, what-what-what's
wrong with you?

08:24.805 --> 08:26.607
Hmm? What? Aah!

08:26.640 --> 08:29.109
I'm fine. You're the one
who's all over the place.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.712
Really? How much
morphine did I have?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.847
(chuckles) You know what,
you've been through a lot.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.850
You're... You should rest.
I'm gonna go.

08:36.884 --> 08:40.153
I'm gonna jet
and I'm gonna text you later.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.155
But... You could...
(sighs)

08:43.190 --> 08:45.158
MARCO:
 Why did you freak out
 and leave?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.994
I don't know.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.896
After I saw Josh
in the hospital,

08:48.929 --> 08:51.131
I realized she always
goes back to him.

08:51.164 --> 08:53.266
I'm just the guy
she settles for.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.003
Greg, she likes you.
She chose you.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.139
You guys have sex
50 times a day.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.008
Why do-- why do I tell you
those things?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.010
Eh, you got issues, kid.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.144
Oh, it's awful.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.213
I... (sighs)
I can't care this much.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.281
Caring, on me,
is very unattractive.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.883
It'll ruin everything.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.620
I chased after her for months,
no interest from her,

09:12.653 --> 09:14.822
I finally force myself
to stop caring,

09:14.855 --> 09:16.189
and that's when she was into me.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.092
That's what she likes--
the not caring.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.261
Oh, come on,
this is embarrassing.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.665
This is fear talking.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.299
You're just afraid
she's gonna hurt you again.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.935
I know what I need to do.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.803
I need to be...

09:29.837 --> 09:32.806
like, the uncaring bad boy.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.075
Oh, my God, you're an idiot.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.979
You can look now.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.317
I thought you weren't supposed
to wear white to a wedding.

09:44.351 --> 09:48.121
Technically it's ivory and
Jayma's dress is Alaskan Snow.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.323
Don't you already have
a bridesmaid's dress?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.926
(laughs) I need a second look
for the reception.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.327
Don't be insane-brain.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.864
Also, I look amazing
in this dress.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.065
I ordered some
shoes, too,

09:58.098 --> 10:01.334
but they haven't come in.
I'm just trying to be patient.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.270
Patient, yeah.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.972
You're good at that.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.707
I am?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.876
With me.

10:11.011 --> 10:14.848
V, I know you want a commitment.

10:14.882 --> 10:18.351
Some women wouldn't have
put up with me this long.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.353
What are you saying?
I'm saying

10:20.387 --> 10:22.756
I'm not oblivious.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.225
I know what the next step
is for us.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.127
I'm going to look for a ring.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.362
But I'm just
asking you

10:29.396 --> 10:30.430
one thing.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.901
Just... let me do it
in my own way.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.704
In my own time.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.772
Is that okay?

10:38.806 --> 10:40.373
Of course.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.142
Whatever you need.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.750
(mouthing)

10:54.021 --> 10:55.455
HEATHER:
 You need to realize

10:55.488 --> 10:58.391
that "You up?" is text
for "Are you horny?"

10:58.425 --> 10:59.993
Okay, whatever, listen.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.161
I need to talk to somebody.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.130
And I'm in a huge fight
with my best friend right now,

11:03.163 --> 11:05.733
and without her I'm feeling
super insecure about Greg.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.935
Yeah, and since you
know him super well,

11:07.968 --> 11:10.270
I don't know, I thought
you could help me out.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.040
So... what's the problem?

11:13.073 --> 11:15.042
I mean, I, of all people,

11:15.075 --> 11:17.077
know he digs you.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.411
Right, okay, but we
were in the hospital,

11:18.445 --> 11:20.080
and he was really sweet,
and then we got home,

11:20.113 --> 11:21.314
and he was,
like, weird again.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.150
Yeah, that sounds like Greg.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.086
I mean, you know, he gets,
like, freaked about stuff.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.421
Plus, you have
that weird thing with Josh.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.290
So maybe...
No, no, no, no.
He knows that's over, though.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.026
He knows that's done.
I want to be with him.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.895
We need to share how we
feel with the other...

11:34.928 --> 11:37.064
Yeah, we need, like,
a moment, right?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.365
A moment, like,
where the prince

11:38.398 --> 11:41.168
and princess
pledge their troth.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.036
Feed their pigs?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.438
No, like, they-they dance
together at a ball.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.974
Or they kiss in a tower.

11:47.007 --> 11:50.177
They sail on a magic carpet
through the sky.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
I just want to look

11:52.079 --> 11:54.381
into Greg's eyes and,
you know, have a moment!

11:54.414 --> 11:56.116
It's the moment!

11:56.149 --> 11:57.250
It's like, oh, it's like
in that movie Slumbered,

11:57.284 --> 12:00.320
when the princess wakes up
and then the song starts.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.956
You know--
* In one indescribable instant

12:02.990 --> 12:05.192
* The whole world
falls away... *

12:05.225 --> 12:06.994
Oh, God, you're
one of those girls.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.196
Okay, dude, so the moment
you're craving

12:09.229 --> 12:11.464
isn't anchored
in real emotion.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.333
It's a script
dictated to you

12:13.366 --> 12:16.103
by our society's
patriarchal love narrative.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.838
Wow, that's fascinating.
Did you learn that in school?

12:17.871 --> 12:19.472
No, actually that's
from this month's Glamour.

12:19.506 --> 12:23.210
Look, just tell him
how you feel.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.278
Say, "Dude, I dig you.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.414
I got the feels."

12:27.447 --> 12:30.350
I mean, angels don't have
to be singing or some crap.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.486
But just, like, be chill.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.487
(knocking)

12:34.521 --> 12:35.823
GREG:
 Just remember

12:35.856 --> 12:38.358
I don't care.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.827
Hey!
Yo!

12:39.860 --> 12:41.128
What up?
What up?

12:41.161 --> 12:42.229
I brought brew dogs!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.430
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.497
Hi.
Thanks.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.099
It's good-- oh.
Oh.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.267
That's fine.
We're just hanging!

12:47.300 --> 12:48.401
It's fine.
Oh...

12:48.435 --> 12:50.270
So I, uh, I just came over

12:50.303 --> 12:52.239
to, you know,
like rap and hang out

12:52.272 --> 12:54.241
and talk about stuff.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.408
It doesn't even have to be
the primary activity, though.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.910
We can do other stuff
while we're talking.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.378
Do you, uh, do you
want to watch TV?

12:58.411 --> 12:59.980
Yeah, sounds great.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.381
It's great.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.851
Turn it on.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.285
Oh, The Way We Were.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.553
I don't want to watch it.
I'm sorry.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.289
I was just like saying, "Oh,
it's The Way We Were, blah."

13:10.590 --> 13:11.892
There's
a monster truck rally on.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.527
What do you think?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.263
That could be
so bad it's awesome.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.530
Yeah, that's funny.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.899
It's really funny.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.904
Hey, um, so, so the rea--
the reason I-I,

13:23.937 --> 13:26.439
I came over, um, uh,

13:26.473 --> 13:29.309
was I, uh, I wanted to

13:29.342 --> 13:31.879
(southern accent):
tell you that I...

13:31.912 --> 13:34.447
(sniffs)
Did you fart?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.582
Yeah, I did.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.550
I, uh, ate a bean burrito

13:37.584 --> 13:39.286
out of the freezer
from the '90s,

13:39.319 --> 13:41.021
'cause I don't
care, and, uh,

13:41.054 --> 13:42.222
I have a candle--
do you want it?

13:42.255 --> 13:43.423
I have a triple wick.
I can get it--

13:43.456 --> 13:44.324
I don't care, though.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.293
Nah, I don't care,
I mean, it's, you know,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.561
it's the body.
The body makes things.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.262
So I get it.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna get it.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.164
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just...

13:51.198 --> 13:54.201
Cool, um... I'll probably
let one rip, too, 'cause...

13:54.234 --> 13:55.335
farting is hilarious.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.938
It's classic humor. What's that?

14:00.473 --> 14:04.477
Oh, wow,
it's Jayma's wedding invitation.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.046
(gasps)

14:06.079 --> 14:09.049
Gasp. How romantic.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.618
It's perfect.

14:13.086 --> 14:18.391
LITTLE REBECCA:
* In one indescribable instant

14:18.425 --> 14:22.529
* The whole world falls away.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.564
*

14:31.371 --> 14:32.973
I found it.
This one's extra strength.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.341
Should do
the trick.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.508
So, what did you want to say?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.384
Oh, yeah.
Did you get that invite?

14:44.417 --> 14:45.585
Are you going
to Jayma's wedding?

14:45.618 --> 14:48.155
Y-Yes.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.289
I was gonna ask
if you were going,

14:49.322 --> 14:51.691
but I knew you were a bridesmaid
and then you weren't.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.026
What happened there?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.261
Oh, it was nothing.
It was just, like,

14:54.294 --> 14:55.128
a stupid clerical error.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.196
But, um,
yeah,

14:56.229 --> 14:57.097
no, I'm-I'm definitely...

14:57.130 --> 14:58.131
definitely going.
Sounds like a hoot.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.432
Um, hey, oh, my gosh,

14:59.466 --> 15:01.134
this just popped into my nogs.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.702
Do you want to go... together?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.604
Yeah. No. Uh, s-sure.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.673
I don't care. We...
I could, um...

15:06.706 --> 15:09.209
We could... we could go.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.543
Great! So, let me...
I'll just make sure

15:10.577 --> 15:13.380
I RSVP'd with Josh's mom.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.616
WOMAN:
 Now,

15:16.649 --> 15:19.086
for my song, I
need to be seated

15:19.119 --> 15:22.455
exactly 20 feet away, because
I have a 15-second intro.

15:22.489 --> 15:26.026
Myrna, this is my daughter's
wedding, not a gig at Pechanga.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.160
I'm her aunt.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.296
This is my gift to her.

15:29.329 --> 15:32.299
As God gifted me with my voice.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.735
Basically, I'm giving her
a gift from God.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.205
She's registered.
She needs dish towels.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.707
Um,

15:40.740 --> 15:43.610
just so you know, there's a

15:43.643 --> 15:46.379
small person staring
at us. Oh, God,

15:46.413 --> 15:48.481
I think it's one of my fans
from Star Search.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.217
Yeah, that's probably it.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.219
Oh, boy.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.320
Rebecca...

15:53.353 --> 15:55.122
You know her?
(sighs)

15:55.155 --> 15:58.491
Mrs. Chan. (stammers)
What an uber-duber coinkydinky

15:58.525 --> 16:02.195
to run into you here.
That's so funny.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.197
Stop. You're Josh's Aunt Myrna.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.266
I've heard
so much about you.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.534
Mrs. Chan, it is so funny

16:07.567 --> 16:09.536
that I very coincidentally
ran into you,

16:09.569 --> 16:12.139
because I, um... I
actually just-just bought Jayma

16:12.172 --> 16:13.240
a wedding present.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.776
(gasps)

16:16.809 --> 16:20.747
You got
the Lladro Cherub on a Peacock?

16:20.780 --> 16:24.251
This retails for $2,499.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.753
You are an angel.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.755
Thank you. You know,

16:28.788 --> 16:31.124
I'm really glad
that I, again, coincidentally

16:31.158 --> 16:33.493
ran into you, because I've been
wanting to talk to you about

16:33.526 --> 16:34.761
what happened
with Jayma's wedding dress.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.496
Yes, that was
unfortunate.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.232
But I know you didn't do it,
Rebecca.
(exhales)

16:39.266 --> 16:41.568
Valencia was involved,
and, with her,

16:41.601 --> 16:44.237
things tend to get complicated.

16:44.271 --> 16:46.706
Ate, that's not very nice.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.276
Valencia is a wonderful girl.

16:50.410 --> 16:55.148
Anyway, so if you could give
this to Jayma for me...

16:55.182 --> 16:57.150
I have a better idea.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.385
Deliver it yourself.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.553
Why don't you come
to the wedding?

17:00.587 --> 17:02.422
Okay!

17:02.455 --> 17:06.759
(chuckling)
That would be great. Thank you!

17:14.201 --> 17:16.603
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Guess
what. I have great news.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.604
So, I used your
Armenian tracking device

17:17.637 --> 17:21.208
to follow Lourdes,
and it worked like a dream.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.276
Let me tell you what happened.
So, I tracked Lourdes down

17:23.310 --> 17:24.444
at Boba,
and I got

17:24.477 --> 17:25.578
reinvited to Jayma's wedding.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.446
So now I can go with Greg

17:27.480 --> 17:29.616
and we can have a moment
and share our feelings

17:29.649 --> 17:32.152
and our relationship can begin.
So I wanted to tell you

17:32.185 --> 17:35.188
Greg stuff can be really fun
and sneaky, too!

17:37.890 --> 17:39.559
Come on!

17:39.592 --> 17:41.328
(whining):
Just take me back.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.696
Come on.
Please, let's go have a donut.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.865
Right?
Let's go have a donut hole.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.867
Let's go have a donut hole
shoved into a donut.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.203
I thought of a name for it--
it's called a whole-nut.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.708
No, Paula, it's
a whole-nut.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.478
A whole-nut.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.082
(sighs)

18:08.221 --> 18:10.523
I'm looking for something
really pretty, Moshe.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.592
It's gonna be
a very special evening.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.462
The start of a love story.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.464
Ah, how wonderful.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.433
So, have you, uh,
found your bashert?

18:21.901 --> 18:23.470
Your soul mate. Your destiny.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.605
Have you...
have you found him yet?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.607
Have I found my soul mate?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.377
Have I found my s...
(door opens)

18:31.511 --> 18:32.679
Josh.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.614
Rebecca, you're-you're, uh...

18:34.647 --> 18:37.617
(clears throat)
back from the hospital.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.352
Y-You feeling better?

18:39.386 --> 18:42.189
Yeah. Thank you.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.592
You're back,
Mr. Chan.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.360
You want to see
the engagement rings

18:47.394 --> 18:49.462
you were looking at before?

18:50.797 --> 18:54.934
Engagement rings. Wow.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.903
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, just...

18:56.936 --> 18:59.606
been thinkin' about it.
It's time.
Mm-hmm.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.909
That's really...

19:02.942 --> 19:05.378
great and romantic.
Congratulations.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.914
Congratulations. Oh, my God.
Congratulations.
Yeah.

19:07.947 --> 19:12.385
So, uh, what are you doing here?
(chuckles)

19:12.419 --> 19:13.953
Right. I'm getting earrings,

19:13.986 --> 19:15.788
uh, for your sister's wedding,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.325
actually. Yeah. I'm going.
I'm, um... I'm going...
Oh. Yeah. Right.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.959
um, uh, well,
I'm going with-with Greg.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.694
Right. Yeah. Great. Of course.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.430
(scoffs)

19:26.466 --> 19:29.436
Wow, those are
really beautiful.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.472
Like something out
of a fairy tale.

19:35.308 --> 19:39.812
Oy vay. What, what's
with these sad faces?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.948
My best

19:41.981 --> 19:43.983
to you and Valencia
both and always.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.353
Thank you. I-I also give to you

19:46.386 --> 19:48.821
and all of yours also
my-my best.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.723
Okay. Yeah.

19:58.365 --> 20:02.369
So, you ready
to make a choice?

20:10.910 --> 20:14.013
Well, Becky, today's the day.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.483
Today you are gonna tell Greg

20:16.516 --> 20:18.618
that you want
to start a life together,

20:18.651 --> 20:20.753
and it's gonna be perfect.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.390
God, pep talks into a mirror
do nothing

20:23.423 --> 20:24.691
but enhance the loneliness.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.360
(chirping)

20:27.394 --> 20:29.629
Well, hello, Mr. Love Bird!

20:29.662 --> 20:31.931
Are you here to help me
get ready for the ball?

20:34.467 --> 20:37.704
(gasps)
You are? Well, that's lovely.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.771
And I'm so glad you're here.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.440
Because today

20:40.473 --> 20:42.442
I'm gonna declare my love
to a prince,

20:42.475 --> 20:44.777
and it's gonna be
oh-so-romantic.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.780
A perfect moment.

20:47.814 --> 20:52.652
(off-key):
* In one indescribable instant

20:52.685 --> 20:56.423
* The whole world falls away

20:58.758 --> 20:59.726
* In...

20:59.759 --> 21:01.428
GREG:
Rebecca!

21:01.461 --> 21:02.862
Who you talking to?

21:02.895 --> 21:06.399
No one! Who are you...
talking to?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.067
(clears throat)

21:08.100 --> 21:10.570
(humming)

21:12.739 --> 21:15.675
And now, the
Kingdom of Scarsdale

21:15.708 --> 21:17.977
presents the
beautiful daughter

21:18.010 --> 21:20.413
of Silas and Naomi Bunch...

21:20.447 --> 21:22.482
me!

21:24.351 --> 21:26.553
Okay, so just-just imagine
I'm, like, floating,

21:26.586 --> 21:27.720
like, on a pillow of magic.

21:27.754 --> 21:31.023
And there are men with trumpets
lining the walkway.
Wow.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.459
It's the movie Slumbered.
It's fine.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.861
I, uh...

21:34.894 --> 21:37.497
I don't... know what to say.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.831
Am I overdressed?
Is this too...?

21:38.865 --> 21:40.567
I don't know.
Is this too much?
No.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.371
You look all right.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.572
All right. Okay.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.874
I will take that.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.710
Oh. You're wearing sneakers?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.646
Yeah, well, I didn't know
you were gonna get all fancy.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.048
I didn't know it was gonna be
like a whole thing.

21:56.082 --> 21:59.118
Um, yeah. No, it's a wedding,
uh, but I should have

21:59.151 --> 22:00.453
been clearer,
so it's fine.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.654
Let's go. It'll be so fun,

22:01.688 --> 22:03.122
and you'll say
nice things there.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.591
Okay, I'm gonna float out.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.894
Floating out,
floating out.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.730
(crowd chatter)

22:10.763 --> 22:14.601
It was... Oh, that ceremony--
it was so beautiful.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.470
I cried so much.
I just love weddings.

22:17.504 --> 22:20.072
Of course you do,
you poor unmarried thing.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.340
Josh,

22:21.374 --> 22:23.843
when are you gonna put a ring
on this lovely girl's finger?

22:29.516 --> 22:32.619
Oh, my God,
this is lovely.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.020
Yeah, I guess.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.888
No. Isn't it romantic?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.957
I don't know.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.493
If you think about it,
it's kind of the epitome

22:40.527 --> 22:41.428
of Southern California pastiche.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.530
A chain hotel with
vaguely French decor,

22:43.563 --> 22:46.499
and Italian food is
being served tapas-style

22:46.533 --> 22:48.668
while a Filipino girl
is marrying a Jewish guy,

22:48.701 --> 22:52.505
all with a lightly Arabian
Nights-style wedding.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.808
What was this Pinterest board
called: ironic juxtaposition?

22:55.842 --> 22:57.910
I like that kind of mélange.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.912
We're way too sober
for this wedding.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.714
How about I get
us some shots?

23:01.748 --> 23:03.583
Okay.
Okay. Hold on.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.118
Okay. Shots. I mean,
I could also go for champagne,

23:06.152 --> 23:08.555
but shots are funny, too. Okay.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.056
I love this.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.124
A chain hotel with French decor

23:12.158 --> 23:14.060
and Italian food
served tapas-style

23:14.093 --> 23:16.563
while a Filipino girl
marries a Jewish guy

23:16.596 --> 23:19.065
in a lightly
Arabian Nights-style wedding.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.867
It is so romantic.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.669
Sure we're supposed to
be wearing tuxes, dude?

23:22.702 --> 23:25.438
We are here to celebrate love,

23:25.472 --> 23:28.608
and we're gonna do that
at a ten, am I right?

23:28.641 --> 23:30.477
Yeah. Yeah!
Mm-hmm.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.978
Yeah.
We're fancy.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.980
Deal with it.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.085
Hey.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.553
Hey.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.555
Wow.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.223
Look at you.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.893
Oh, yeah. I don't know.
Do you think it's a bit much?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.895
No. You look amazing.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.598
Like a princess.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.102
Look, this is none
of my business,

23:56.135 --> 23:57.970
but I have to say something.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.473
If you get mad at me,
I understand.

24:00.507 --> 24:01.841
Okay.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.976
Are you sure
Greg is what you want?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.512
I mean, he's
so sarcastic

24:05.545 --> 24:07.714
and dark, and you're not that.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.915
You're sweet.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.583
Um, Josh...

24:10.617 --> 24:12.585
I'm just afraid
you're going to get hurt.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.020
I've known Greg
since I was five,

24:14.053 --> 24:16.723
and I love the dude,
but he's complicated.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.157
He quits on things
as soon as they get hard.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.126
Did you know
he wanted to be

24:20.159 --> 24:21.327
a professional
dodge ball player?

24:21.360 --> 24:23.930
And then we're not even allowed
to ask him about that now.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.902
*

24:31.938 --> 24:35.274
I'm just afraid there will be
a moment when he lets you down.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.876
He's gonna disappoint you
somehow.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.277
I-I feel it.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.548
That's very sweet of you,
but I'm okay.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.750
I'm okay.
I-I know what I'm doing.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.652
Okay.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.688
That's all I wanted to say.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.723
Okay.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.229
I'm back.

24:57.263 --> 25:00.232
Anything, uh, interesting
happen while I was away?

25:00.266 --> 25:04.804
Uh, no. As soon as they open
the ballroom, let's cut a rug?

25:04.837 --> 25:07.073
(sighs)
Yeah, I'm not so much
of a dancer.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.675
I'm more of an I-hate-dancing.

25:08.708 --> 25:11.177
Let's do a shot
and then let's go dance, okay?

25:11.210 --> 25:13.212
Okay.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.683
(door opens)

25:21.153 --> 25:23.656
Okay, come on.

25:23.690 --> 25:27.560
Please? Just one? Come on.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.061
It'll be fun.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.663
Oh, that's
really pretty.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.566
Oh, this is
so... lovely.
(sighs heavily)

25:33.600 --> 25:37.203
(sighs)

25:37.236 --> 25:38.805
All right.
Shall we?

25:38.838 --> 25:41.073
You ready for this?
I'm so ready.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.209
Oh.
And... dip.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.344
And dip.
Okay.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.746
And dip.
Okay.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.347
And another dip.
No!

25:48.380 --> 25:50.082
Okay. Okay. No, that's fun.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.818
That's really funny,
but let's dance for...

25:51.851 --> 25:53.019
let's dance for real now.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.821
Oh, you want the real stuff?

25:54.854 --> 25:56.355
I... I do.
Oh... ss...!

25:56.388 --> 25:58.691
Look, I'm sizzling bacon.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.693
Ss...
I'm sorry. I...

26:00.727 --> 26:02.995
You know, just stop,
stop, stop. I...

26:03.029 --> 26:05.231
Let's really dance,
dude. Please. Come on.

26:05.264 --> 26:08.635
Please? For me?

26:10.670 --> 26:13.139
Thank you. That's better.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.874
(sighs)

26:17.744 --> 26:20.379
Look, there's been something
I want to say to you tonight.

26:20.412 --> 26:23.616
And that's...

26:23.650 --> 26:26.118
DJ:
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
for joining us this evening!

26:26.152 --> 26:28.154
It is my pleasure
to introduce to you...

26:28.187 --> 26:30.723
Phillip and Jayma dancing
for the very first time

26:30.757 --> 26:32.759
as Mr. and Mrs. Epstein!
(applause and cheering)

26:36.028 --> 26:38.030
(upbeat big band song playing)

26:43.703 --> 26:45.672
* This is a happy...

26:45.705 --> 26:48.407
That's so cute.
It's so corny.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.877
No! It's two people in
love, and they're dancing.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.211
What's wrong with that?

26:52.244 --> 26:54.781
DJ:
Now everyone please join
the bride and groom

26:54.814 --> 26:56.683
on the dance floor.
What's up with you tonight?

26:56.716 --> 26:57.884
You're, like, extra
snarky for no reason.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.952
Guess I'm just a bad boy.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.889
* This is the moment...
What?

27:02.922 --> 27:04.791
(sighs)

27:04.824 --> 27:07.794
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I-I'm... I'm-I'm trying...

27:07.827 --> 27:09.061
What are you trying to do?

27:09.095 --> 27:10.296
What... what is all this?

27:10.329 --> 27:12.298
You know what? You're right.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.801
Let's dance for real.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.103
Let's show off your dress.
Come on.
Oh.

27:17.136 --> 27:21.741
* This is the day
for you and I... *

27:24.343 --> 27:27.246
DJ:
And now the groomsmen have a
surprise for the special couple.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.048
There's a lot of events.
(sighs)

27:29.081 --> 27:32.084
(rhythmic percussion playing)

27:32.118 --> 27:34.186
What is this?
Oh, my God.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.423
(instrumental dance song with
Middle Eastern flavor plays)

27:38.825 --> 27:40.259
How funny is this?

27:40.292 --> 27:42.461
It's really funny.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.697
(laughs)

27:58.845 --> 28:01.380
Sorry. Tell Janice I'm sorry.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.224
Hey, multiple Aladdins!

28:12.258 --> 28:14.827
You're not really hovering!

28:14.861 --> 28:16.996
I can see your wheels!

28:29.942 --> 28:32.378
(clicking)

28:46.525 --> 28:49.461
Hoverboard dancing
is not dancing.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.198
Their feet are frozen.
Mm-hmm.

28:52.231 --> 28:56.035
You take the board away, mainly
what they're doing is leaning.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.805
It's synch... it's synchronized
leaning, basically.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.239
Yeah, well, you
couldn't do it.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.508
Yeah, well, I couldn't shake
your hand with my foot,

29:02.541 --> 29:04.510
or... but you don't want that.

29:04.543 --> 29:08.180
You're not really
making a lot of sense.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.482
Amn't I?
No. You am not.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.786
What is going on
with you, dude?

29:13.820 --> 29:15.321
What does that mean?

29:15.354 --> 29:17.523
Well, your date is
over there by herself,

29:17.556 --> 29:21.260
and you're here by yourself
getting, like, plowed.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.197
Okay.
(doorbell rings)

29:25.231 --> 29:26.532
(sighs)

29:26.565 --> 29:28.200
Put on some kind of dress.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.836
What?!
We're going
to a wedding.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.070
Have you lost your mind?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.806
Rebecca is sad.
She needs you.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.009
We're not friends anymore, okay?
And it's her fault. All right.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.811
I did everything for her.

29:38.845 --> 29:41.814
I gave her the best advice,
and she chose to ignore it.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.482
So, I mean,
I was the great friend.

29:43.515 --> 29:44.817
Oh, my God, are you serious?

29:44.851 --> 29:46.252
You think
that's what a friend is?

29:46.285 --> 29:47.486
Someone who tells you
what to do?

29:47.519 --> 29:49.088
That is not friendship.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.289
I'd never
do that to you.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.491
And, Paula,
you and I are best friends!

29:52.524 --> 29:54.827
(laughs)
What?

29:54.861 --> 29:57.096
Oh, yeah. No. Yes, we are.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.430
Yes, we are.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.366
Now go get your dress on
and let's boogie.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.368
(sighs)

30:02.401 --> 30:04.403
(crowd chatter)

30:07.306 --> 30:09.308
(sighing)

30:15.081 --> 30:16.515
You're not having the
best time, are you?

30:16.548 --> 30:18.885
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.453
You're at a crossroads.

30:21.487 --> 30:24.556
I see that.

30:24.590 --> 30:26.993
And I think I can help.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.494
You can?

30:31.931 --> 30:34.533
This belonged
to your grandma.

30:34.566 --> 30:38.170
It would be perfect
on Valencia.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.206
Whenever you're ready.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.541
Wow! Tita Myrna,

30:42.574 --> 30:45.177
I... I don't know what to say.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.846
It's nice of you to...

30:57.589 --> 31:01.928
Wait. Did Valencia
put you up to this?

31:10.937 --> 31:12.438
I am so sorry.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.572
I am so sorry.
No, I am so sorry.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.908
This is all my fault.
It's all my fault.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.576
No, I wanted to tell you about
Greg so many times.
I should
have been a better friend.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.045
I was racked with guilt.
I should have just
listened to you.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.279
Every time I saw you, I wanted
to tell you everything.
And I felt so bad.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.447
Every time I saw your name,
I wanted to pick up the phone.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.882
I've been having so much sex.
You look like a princess.

31:23.916 --> 31:24.850
Oh, my God,
you look like a princess.
You look beautiful.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.817
You look like a sea princess
and you're, like,

31:25.851 --> 31:26.919
wearing a necklace with crabs.
I feel so bad.

31:26.953 --> 31:28.955
And I wish I'd been with you
to buy that crab necklace.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.522
I should have been better.
You're my daughter,

31:30.556 --> 31:32.591
and I should have been
a better mother.
Oh, my God,
I feel like you're my mom.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.927
So I just thought this was
gonna be mine and Greg's

31:34.961 --> 31:36.195
romantic evening,
and, oh, I'm sorry.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.463
I know you don't want
to hear about this.

31:37.496 --> 31:41.367
Hey, I'm not telling you what to
do anymore. I am done with that.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.937
But if you really like Greg,
you should tell him right away.

31:44.971 --> 31:45.938
I mean, don't waste
a single second.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.339
I'm sorry, that was advice-y.

31:47.373 --> 31:48.975
No, it's okay, I liked it.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.542
Thank you.

31:53.379 --> 31:54.613
I love you, Paula.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.616
I love you, too.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.285
Okay, you called my aunt

31:59.318 --> 32:01.387
and asked her to bring
a family heirloom

32:01.420 --> 32:03.990
to my sister's wedding
without asking me?

32:04.023 --> 32:06.625
Well, I knew she had it
and would love to give it to us

32:06.658 --> 32:09.095
and I wanted to get it
before your cousin Ruby.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.297
Oh, my God, Valencia!

32:11.330 --> 32:13.232
You didn't have any faith in me.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.235
Y-You couldn't trust me
with this one thing.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.304
I just asked for
a little time, that's all.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.538
A little time, I see.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.974
Because 15 years
isn't enough time.

32:22.008 --> 32:24.376
I was looking.
For rings.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.544
And did you buy one?

32:28.014 --> 32:30.582
You know what,
I have been patient.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.152
I have been patient through
college and through New York

32:33.185 --> 32:35.654
and through all of our friends
getting engaged

32:35.687 --> 32:37.589
and married and I was patient

32:37.623 --> 32:39.491
when you cheated on me
with Rebecca.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.695
The reason I asked for that ring
is because, deep down,

32:43.729 --> 32:46.532
I didn't believe
you were gonna do it.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.100
Were you going to?

32:50.502 --> 32:52.304
You have a ring.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.206
In your hand.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.342
You said that you were ready
for the next step,

32:56.375 --> 32:58.144
so let's do it.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.712
Let's take that ring
and get up on the bandstand

33:00.746 --> 33:03.582
and steal some wedding thunder
and get engaged right now.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.417
(scoffs)

33:05.451 --> 33:07.519
You're not listening to me.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.425
You never listen to me.
You...

33:13.459 --> 33:16.728
You pretend to, but...

33:16.762 --> 33:18.330
you never do.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.432
You know,

33:20.466 --> 33:22.168
for the last few months

33:22.201 --> 33:25.037
I thought Rebecca Bunch
was our problem.

33:25.071 --> 33:27.039
But it's not.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.407
It's you.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.412
I'm done, Josh.
We're over. For good.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.719
Hey. Hey, I want
to talk to you.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.389
So...

33:43.422 --> 33:46.258
tonight's gotten...
pretty off track.

33:46.292 --> 33:50.062
Like, this isn't us.
This isn't how we are.

33:50.096 --> 33:53.265
And... and I think
it's my fault.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.401
Yeah, because I had
an artificial view

33:55.434 --> 33:57.103
of how I wanted
this night to go.

33:57.136 --> 34:00.206
No, it's my fault.
It's my fault. It's my fault.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.208
I should not have
worn sneakers tonight.

34:02.241 --> 34:05.111
Justin Timberlake
wore sneakers with a suit

34:05.144 --> 34:07.513
and I thought I was cool,
but I'm no JTimbo.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.217
You're hilariously wasted.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.752
I know

34:13.784 --> 34:16.222
what you want to say to me.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.257
You want to break up with me.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.367
Break up with you? Oh, my...

34:28.400 --> 34:30.136
No. Greg, okay.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.271
Listen...

34:32.304 --> 34:35.607
this, like, this emotion stuff
can be scary.

34:35.641 --> 34:38.476
My parents split up
when I was little,

34:38.510 --> 34:42.148
your mom left, we don't have
the greatest role models here.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.783
But there's been something

34:44.815 --> 34:47.219
I've been wanting
to tell you all night.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.788
And even though
it scares me to death,

34:49.821 --> 34:51.790
I'm gonna be brave.

34:51.822 --> 34:54.426
So, uh,

34:54.460 --> 34:57.896
even though we've only been
seeing each other

34:57.929 --> 34:59.798
for a short time...

34:59.831 --> 35:01.767
I, um...

35:01.800 --> 35:04.370
I care about you.

35:04.403 --> 35:08.340
Like, a lot.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.252
So, tell me...

35:20.286 --> 35:23.255
tell me how you feel.
If you have any feelings. And...

35:23.289 --> 35:25.257
I don't care how you tell me,
Greg, okay?

35:25.291 --> 35:27.326
I don't care if you fart
while you're saying it,

35:27.359 --> 35:29.428
just please tell me.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.173
Can you say something?

35:41.207 --> 35:42.541
Okay.

35:42.574 --> 35:45.877
I... think...

35:47.713 --> 35:49.448
...you're cool.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.218
You...

35:52.251 --> 35:54.220
Sorry, after, like,
everything we've been through,

35:54.253 --> 35:56.355
you just, you just
think I'm cool?

35:56.388 --> 35:58.724
Yeah. I think...

35:58.757 --> 36:00.826
we have fun together, yeah.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.429
But let's not...

36:03.462 --> 36:06.298
like, plan out our future.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.634
Let's just focus on, um...

36:08.667 --> 36:10.669
on tonight and have fun, okay?

36:12.538 --> 36:14.373
Wait, what?

36:17.509 --> 36:20.912
Uh, but right now
I, um...

36:20.946 --> 36:23.882
I need to-- I need to take a--
I need to take a nap.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.453
Greg?

36:27.486 --> 36:31.590
Greg? Hey.
Hey, Greg?

36:31.623 --> 36:34.593
Ah, yes, the classic
Serrano pass-out.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.395
I'll get him
an Uber.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.729
Um, yeah, and I'll go with you.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.731
No, you will not. You stay here.
You don't want to see

36:39.765 --> 36:41.333
what's on the other side
of this.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.634
War movie.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.506
I'm sorry he blew it.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.242
I know that
he cares, but...

36:50.276 --> 36:52.544
it's Greg,
it's just who he is.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.354
Hey, everybody,
time to get inside.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.555
Aunt Myrna's going to sing.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.790
(applause)

37:04.823 --> 37:08.694
DJ:
Ladies and gentlemen,
Aunt Myrna.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.531
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, hello, everyone.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.033
I would like to
dedicate this song

37:15.066 --> 37:16.635
to Jayma

37:16.668 --> 37:18.804
and Phillip. You may
already know this one.

37:18.837 --> 37:22.574
I sang this on Star Search
in 1984

37:22.608 --> 37:25.944
and I got 3 3/4 stars.

37:25.977 --> 37:29.548
She's just the worst.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.984
* In one indescribable

37:33.018 --> 37:35.454
* Instant

37:35.487 --> 37:36.988
* The whole world

37:37.022 --> 37:39.658
* Falls away

37:39.691 --> 37:42.060
* In one

37:42.093 --> 37:45.997
* Indescribable instant

37:46.031 --> 37:47.599
* You'll know just

37:47.633 --> 37:50.602
* What to say

37:50.636 --> 37:51.603
* In one

37:51.637 --> 37:55.674
* Indescribable instant

37:55.707 --> 37:56.942
* Your heart

37:56.975 --> 37:59.945
* Will speak the truth

37:59.978 --> 38:01.413
* 'Cause in that

38:01.447 --> 38:03.615
* One indescribable

38:03.649 --> 38:05.817
* Magical, mystical

38:05.851 --> 38:07.953
* Endless, incredible

38:07.986 --> 38:10.422
* Instant

38:10.456 --> 38:11.890
* The only words

38:11.923 --> 38:14.860
* You'll need are

38:14.893 --> 38:18.664
* "I love you"

38:23.635 --> 38:25.637
*

38:44.490 --> 38:46.625
Come with me.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.070
It's over.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.606
What?

39:00.639 --> 39:02.941
Rebecca, Valencia
and I are done.

39:05.777 --> 39:08.814
Becks, I have tried
not to think about you.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.516
I have.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.651
You have no idea
how hard I've tried.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.386
Just, no matter
what I do...

39:15.987 --> 39:17.689
I feel you with me.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.629
(gasps)

39:23.662 --> 39:27.165
Oh, my God,
it's my letter from camp.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.901
You keep this with you,
like, all the time?

39:29.935 --> 39:32.571
Look, I know
you're with Greg, but...

39:32.604 --> 39:34.606
Stop.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.115
* In one indescribable

39:44.149 --> 39:47.085
* Instant

39:47.118 --> 39:49.087
* There is no time

39:49.120 --> 39:51.590
* Or space

39:51.623 --> 39:54.993
* In one indescribable

39:55.026 --> 39:56.828
* Instant

39:56.862 --> 40:00.799
* It all falls into place

40:00.832 --> 40:04.536
* In one indescribable

40:04.570 --> 40:05.871
* Instant

40:05.904 --> 40:07.739
* Your dreams

40:07.773 --> 40:10.709
* Will all come true

40:10.742 --> 40:12.444
* 'Cause in that

40:12.478 --> 40:14.813
* One indescribable

40:14.846 --> 40:16.815
* Magical, mystical

40:16.848 --> 40:19.485
* Endless, incredible

40:19.518 --> 40:20.752
* Barely believable

40:20.786 --> 40:23.822
* Truly unlikely

40:23.855 --> 40:26.992
* But not inconceivable

40:27.025 --> 40:29.628
* What, are you kidding me

40:29.661 --> 40:31.897
* No, it's for realable

40:31.930 --> 40:35.701
* Instant

40:35.734 --> 40:38.837
* The only words

40:38.870 --> 40:40.906
* You'll need are

40:40.939 --> 40:44.843
* "I love

40:44.876 --> 40:49.881
* You..."

40:58.924 --> 41:02.160
(song ends)

41:02.193 --> 41:05.030
I love you, Rebecca.

41:05.063 --> 41:08.667
I should have said "I love you."

41:08.700 --> 41:10.636
(retches, coughs)

41:18.309 --> 41:20.278
Hey, Josh?

41:20.311 --> 41:22.280
(short chuckle)
Yeah, Becks?

41:22.313 --> 41:24.282
Can I tell you something?

41:24.315 --> 41:26.518
Yeah.

41:27.686 --> 41:30.021
I moved here for you.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.891
What?

41:32.924 --> 41:36.695
The second I saw you on
the street in New York, I knew.

41:36.728 --> 41:40.165
I j-- I just knew you were
the answer to all my problems.

41:40.198 --> 41:42.901
And I lost sight
of it for a minute,

41:42.934 --> 41:45.771
but now I know for sure.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.773
Mmm.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.008
This is our moment, Josh Chan.

41:51.943 --> 41:55.581
I'm so excited that our
