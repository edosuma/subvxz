Starting to get backed up here.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.460
Well, let's get going.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.419
How's it going, JJ?

01:55.419 --> 01:56.377
Almost there.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.075
Yo, get him to open the trunk.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.295
Jack Jack?

02:01.730 --> 02:03.079
On it!

02:04.167 --> 02:06.213
Turn off your truck
and step out.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.214
Why?

02:07.214 --> 02:08.519
National Security.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.608
Shame on you, bastard.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.610
You are helping the infidels.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.004
Could you kindly turn off
the truck and step out?

02:15.004 --> 02:16.788
Make me if you can.

02:16.788 --> 02:17.963
Is there a problem here?

02:19.487 --> 02:21.141
Time's up!

02:25.188 --> 02:26.972
Eddie. Chow chow?

02:28.496 --> 02:31.151
Eddie's ready. Tom?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.848
Don't talk to me, talk to John.

02:35.503 --> 02:38.070
John! Chow chow?

02:38.070 --> 02:39.376
What's in the back
of the truck?

02:40.072 --> 02:40.943
Jack Jack?

02:41.509 --> 02:42.379
Fishy, John.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.860
Yeah, hold tight. Comin' in.

02:50.692 --> 02:51.736
-  He says
it's empty.
-  Don't fool...

02:53.085 --> 02:54.174
Tell him to open it!

02:58.090 --> 02:59.701
-  Tell him to stop!

02:59.701 --> 03:00.702
-  Jack Jack?
-  Tell him
to fuckin'--

03:03.139 --> 03:04.314
Jack Jack!

03:04.314 --> 03:05.315
Fuck!

03:06.795 --> 03:08.275
Jack Jack!

03:08.275 --> 03:10.451
Move! Move! Move!

03:11.321 --> 03:12.279
Now! Move, move!

03:25.292 --> 03:29.339
<i>All blue

03:40.176 --> 03:41.177
Thank you, bro.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.138
I heard
he's a solid guy.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.488
We'll get him ready,
huh? Jizzy?

03:47.488 --> 03:49.272
Looks like
he got some fresh panties on.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.405
Sergeant Kinley?

03:51.405 --> 03:53.494
Steve Kersher, uh,
I'm the new ECO.
Nice to meet you.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.930
Kersher? Pleasure.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.845
Hey, JJ. Meet your new junior.

03:56.845 --> 03:58.063
Hey, I'm JJ.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.151
Hey, what's up? Steve.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.501
- Introduce him to the boys.
- Sure.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.111
Come meet the guys.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.808
- Guys. Kersher.
He's our new ECO.
-  Hey, Kinley.

04:03.808 --> 04:04.853
I got your interpreter.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.246
'Sup? I'm Steve.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.899
They all military trained?

04:07.899 --> 04:10.554
Some more than others,
but they all
been through basic.

04:10.554 --> 04:11.555
I need someone in shape.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.079
You see that bald one
with the beard?

04:14.819 --> 04:16.256
I'd bite that one.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.084
Now, he speaks four languages
that are worth speaking.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.826
He can be kinda tricky, though.
He won't be pushed around.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.046
Some units don't like him,
you know,
they won't work with him.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.962
All right,
have him step forward.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.311
Hey, Ahmed.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.312
Step forward.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.583
Do you smoke?

04:39.583 --> 04:41.150
No, not for me, sir. No.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.238
Why you want this job?

04:43.935 --> 04:45.197
I need the money, sir.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.635
And what was your profession
before this?

04:48.418 --> 04:49.332
Mechanic.

04:50.028 --> 04:50.986
You good with cars?

04:51.682 --> 04:53.554
Anything with an engine.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.512
Oh, yeah? Well, what's...
what's this?

05:01.126 --> 05:02.389
That's an engine, sir.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.611
You patronizing me, Ahmed?

05:07.611 --> 05:08.960
No. No.

05:10.353 --> 05:13.313
I would never patronize
an officer, sir.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.141
How long you been here?

05:16.620 --> 05:17.795
Five years.

05:17.795 --> 05:18.709
Do you like it?

05:20.189 --> 05:21.190
It's a job, sir.

05:23.105 --> 05:24.889
Well, Akhmed,
this unit specializes

05:24.889 --> 05:27.283
in finding Taliban munitions
and explosive sites.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.765
Basically, we get into trouble.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.333
Sadly...

05:34.986 --> 05:36.336
we lost our last interpreter.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.250
Understood.

05:39.817 --> 05:40.905
And it's "Ahmed", sir.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.430
Oh. Yeah.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.997
Well, it's "Sergeant",
not "sir".

05:47.695 --> 05:50.132
Hey, guys, meet Ahmed,
our new interpreter.

05:50.132 --> 05:52.177
-  Hey. What up, bro?
-  What's up, Ahmed?

05:52.177 --> 05:54.049
Don't disappoint and turn out
to be a pain in the ass.

05:55.572 --> 05:56.530
Not me, sir.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.022
Fucking gross.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.502
I'd kill for some swine.

06:12.502 --> 06:13.851
Do you only think
about food?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.157
And he just ate.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.245
There's nothing here
a man can eat.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.943
Tom, what does that eat?

06:18.943 --> 06:21.555
What it always eats, sausage.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.774
There's nothing wrong
with a little sausage.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.602
You just keep telling
yourself that, Chow Chow.

06:25.602 --> 06:26.995
All right, all right, children.

06:27.735 --> 06:28.692
School time.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.739
You know,
if you're looking for weapons,

06:31.739 --> 06:33.175
you are not gonna
find any here.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.307
Oh, yeah? How do you know?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.224
I know what goes on
behind these doors.

06:39.921 --> 06:40.922
Ah.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.446
The Oracle doth speak.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.362
Again, Haadee.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.588
What's going on?

06:54.588 --> 06:56.807
U.S. Military brother.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.983
I can see that.
What do you want?

06:58.983 --> 07:01.899
They are looking
for Taliban firearms.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.075
I have nothing to do
with those murderers.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.599
I believe you.

07:05.599 --> 07:08.123
But they need to believe you.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.386
They're going to make
their way in.

07:10.386 --> 07:13.694
But they will be as quick
as it takes to confirm
your innocence.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.609
And your house
will be left prettier.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.959
Than the alternative.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.357
All right.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.160
Clear!

07:46.944 --> 07:48.250
All clear.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.860
Clear.

07:49.860 --> 07:50.905
All clear, too.

07:54.822 --> 07:55.823
Clear.

07:58.347 --> 07:59.827
The fuck is this place?

07:59.827 --> 08:01.829
What's it look like?
It's a fuckin' sports bar.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.398
What's he saying?

08:07.704 --> 08:11.534
He says
your intel is poo-poo.

08:11.534 --> 08:12.796
Oh, another Oracle.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.975
I'm just tired
of this bullshit.

08:21.762 --> 08:24.808
All right, well,
I'm gonna stay here
and have a smoke.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.114
I'll see you guys at sunrise.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.162
How come you know so much
about what cooks here?

08:33.817 --> 08:35.776
I'm a man about town.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.952
So, this is how you spend
your lazy afternoons?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.650
You're a dark horse, Ahmed.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.308
All right.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.572
Let's get outta here.

08:49.572 --> 08:52.009
Don't lick, squeeze,
or pop anything.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.056
Jizzy,

08:56.187 --> 08:57.232
don't touch that pipe.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.843
Well, that was fun.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.671
On to the next one, I guess.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.479
Jackpot!

09:27.479 --> 09:29.743
Fuckin' Tali HQ.
We got 'em surrounded.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.353
Haadee,
pull security for a second.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.923
What a quaint
little house on the prairie.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.186
You and I
could retire here, Jizzy.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.667
And we can adopt a labradoodle
and milk something.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.107
What are these coordinates?
It's turning into a fuck fest.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.369
Where is this intel
coming from?

09:48.326 --> 09:49.371
Straight outta head office.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.897
- What'd you wanna do, John?
- I wanna stop wasting time.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.162
Anyway, we got a couple hours.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.818
You got that barbeque,
Chow Chow?

10:03.124 --> 10:04.299
What do you think?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.086
Impressive.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.221
You know, whatever they may
say about us, Ahmed,

10:13.221 --> 10:14.701
we're not all animals,

10:14.701 --> 10:16.050
apart from Chow Chow,
of course.

10:25.581 --> 10:26.843
To Jack Jack.

10:26.843 --> 10:27.844
To Jack Jack.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.676
When do you think Steve
should get his first beer?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.157
Yeah, I don't know.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.985
When do you get to drink
your first beer, Steve?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.595
Uh, whenever you say so, sir.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.732
- Bon appetit.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.255
<i>Merci, mon general.</i>

10:48.996 --> 10:50.475
To the boots
I hope to fill, boys.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.659
How do you like
them apples, sir?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.313
I love these
goddamn apples, John.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.185
I wouldn't normally bother you
with issues like this, sir,

11:04.185 --> 11:06.753
but you're the only one who'll
get anything done around here.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.580
Oh, yeah? What's the problem?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.626
We keep going out
and achieving nothing.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.062
I keep putting my men
in constant danger.

11:12.062 --> 11:16.240
It just feels like we're moving
sand around a sandbox.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.765
I heard your needle got stuck
on this point before.

11:18.765 --> 11:21.376
Look, you've been tasked
with finding IED factories.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.291
You can get creative
in finding them, yeah?

11:23.291 --> 11:24.292
Do it your way.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.512
I don't think
you'll like my way.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.993
I don't think it's important
whether I like it or not,

11:29.993 --> 11:31.386
especially if I don't know
about it.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.650
I really enjoyed
not having this conversation.

11:34.650 --> 11:35.738
You have a good day.

11:38.262 --> 11:41.265
I enjoyed not having
this conversation
with you also, sir.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.835
<i>We are waiting on you
to get back, sir.</i>

11:45.835 --> 11:47.097
<i>ETA, 23:00.</i>

11:47.794 --> 11:48.925
<i>I know, sir.</i>

11:49.970 --> 11:50.971
Declan?

11:51.667 --> 11:52.668
John?

11:54.017 --> 11:55.062
Come through for me?

11:56.803 --> 11:59.153
I feel used by you, John.

11:59.153 --> 12:00.545
You only ever want me
for my brains.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.373
Oh.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.940
It's not like you're
a generous lover.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.507
Well, that's 'cause you never
bought me dinner first.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.424
And, no,
I did not come through.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.642
It took me years
to get these stripes

12:10.642 --> 12:12.557
and I'm not peeling them off
for you.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.604
And since you didn't have
a conversation with Vokes
I just saw you having,

12:15.604 --> 12:19.173
it would be impossible for me
to give you this list
of unvetted targets.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.309
You always play hard to get.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.834
All you gotta do is chase me.

12:27.834 --> 12:29.661
<i>Aircraft engine
maintenance required</i>

12:29.661 --> 12:30.793
<i>on runway six.</i>

12:31.533 --> 12:33.753
What you doin'?

12:33.753 --> 12:37.147
- Oh. Tightening
the fan belt, sir.
- You recognize this guy?

12:42.152 --> 12:43.023
Yes, I do.

12:43.937 --> 12:44.981
All right, come with me.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.210
That's him.
That's Faraj.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.215
Let's do this.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.936
Stay still.
Don't say a fuckin' word.

13:26.936 --> 13:28.546
Oh, relax.
We're gonna go for a ride.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.070
-  Come on. Move.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.854
Easy, easy.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.160
- Move. Move. Go.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.552
- Easy.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.293
Let's go!

13:37.077 --> 13:38.121
Go, go, go, go, go!

13:45.520 --> 13:46.782
Say "cheese".

13:49.741 --> 13:51.004
What do you want?

13:51.004 --> 13:52.570
You know who we are.

13:55.399 --> 13:58.185
Tell him
that this could go
one of two ways.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.621
The money way,
or the other way.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.233
This can go one of two ways,
money or...

14:03.233 --> 14:05.627
You traitor.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.586
You have turned your back
on your own people.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.719
I know who you are.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.678
You're Ali's brother.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.770
I will personally kill
your entire family.

14:18.770 --> 14:21.861
Your wife will see your death.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.472
Just before
I set the dogs on her.

14:28.824 --> 14:31.000
I will tell you nothing.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.307
That doesn't sound
very positive.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.656
He's not too keen to help.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.179
That it?

14:38.138 --> 14:39.226
Pretty much, yes.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.229
Give him some lube.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.934
Carrot.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.503
Stick.

14:55.503 --> 14:58.593
That suit
is for a hot little island
in the Caribbean.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.989
The other is to buy yourself
something pretty.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.344
What do they want to know?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.432
He's ready.

15:11.432 --> 15:12.563
Simple question.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.916
Where do they build the IEDs?

15:16.916 --> 15:20.180
Where is
the Taliban's main location
for making bombs?

15:25.707 --> 15:27.709
It's not just one location.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.667
And you know why.

15:29.667 --> 15:34.150
But I've seen some places
where they make explosives
and stock them.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.805
What'd he say?

15:36.805 --> 15:37.937
He's fishing.
He wants more cash.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.334
Tell him he'll get it
when we finish the job.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.336
We can save a lot of time here
if we give him the cash.

15:47.468 --> 15:48.382
Excuse me?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.388
He'll get it
when we finish the job.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.612
You'll get more
if the information is good.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.311
If you cut
the Taliban's head off here

16:04.311 --> 16:06.182
it will grow back
some place else.

16:15.626 --> 16:16.627
Get on with it.

16:16.627 --> 16:17.846
- The f--

16:17.846 --> 16:19.891
Just in these past two days
new explosives

16:19.891 --> 16:22.851
have been sent
across the country.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.810
I was also supposed to be there
and help.

16:28.683 --> 16:29.727
He has a lead.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.472
A lot of fuckin' dogs
around here.

16:48.572 --> 16:49.530
Hey, Eddie?

16:52.185 --> 16:54.230
What did Faraj say to Ahmed?

16:54.230 --> 16:56.058
He said he'd wipe out
his bloodline,

16:56.058 --> 16:57.886
and murder him in front
of his wife

16:57.886 --> 16:59.279
before he fed her to the dogs.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.412
How do they know each other?

17:02.412 --> 17:03.761
Not sure
this is common knowledge,

17:03.761 --> 17:05.850
but from what I understand,

17:05.850 --> 17:07.504
Ahmed used to work
in the heroin trade.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.377
It's a family business.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.074
They used to work
with the Taliban.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.423
So then,
why is he workin' for us?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.339
Because the Talis killed
his son.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.478
Why the fuck didn't you
tell me this before?

17:25.435 --> 17:26.828
It's the price
of givin' orders.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.346
Don't ever override
my authority again.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.658
I understood your objective.

18:19.228 --> 18:23.885
I apologize
for my clumsy method.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.932
So, we understand each other?

18:31.022 --> 18:32.023
Yes, Sergeant.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.119
Good work.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.087
-  Okay. Yeah.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.569
Okay, buddy.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.005
All right, thank you. Bye.

19:00.835 --> 19:01.836
Sir.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.622
Well,
you got your result.

19:05.622 --> 19:06.623
What do you think, John?

19:07.320 --> 19:08.756
There are two sites.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.061
Do this one at a time.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.238
Keep it quiet.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.154
Well, you need any help,
I'm a phone call away,
all right?

19:15.545 --> 19:17.330
Thank you.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.506
The first IED location
is 30 clicks.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.116
One hour's drive
on a straight track.

19:21.116 --> 19:23.901
And then we reach a fork
in the road, and bang a left.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.642
Excuse me. Sorry.

19:25.642 --> 19:26.817
Yeah, what is it, Haadee?

19:26.817 --> 19:28.341
When we reach the fork
in the road,

19:28.341 --> 19:30.386
my feeling is that
the quickest route
is to turn right,

19:30.386 --> 19:32.823
even though left is shorter
as the crow flies.

19:32.823 --> 19:34.129
Well, quickest, why?

19:34.129 --> 19:35.652
According to the map, it's not.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.871
In the last rainfalls,

19:36.871 --> 19:38.655
most of the road on the left
got washed away.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.310
What do you think, Jizzy?

19:41.310 --> 19:44.835
I guess so.
There is no intel
to confirm or deny.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.402
All right, how much time
does it add to the journey?

19:49.057 --> 19:50.145
About 20 minutes.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.755
Thirty, tops.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.194
All right. So, we got a plan.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.413
Right is right.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.154
- Push that to the highers.
- Cool.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.590
- Okay, let's move out.
- All right, let's go.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.265
Sergeant Kinley,
can you please stop
the vehicle?

20:23.265 --> 20:24.440
Excuse me?

20:24.440 --> 20:26.137
I need to speak
to you, Sergeant.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.401
We don't stop
the vehicles. We keep moving.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.011
I think
we have a problem.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.578
Please stop the vehicle, Sergeant.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.972
Okay,
stop the truck, Jizzy.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.848
-  <i>All vehicles
for a tactical stop.</i>
-  Come on, guys.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.110
- What is it, Ahmed?
-  Three-sixty watch.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.633
- Let's go!
- Something's wrong.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.505
There's no logical reason
for Haadee

20:45.505 --> 20:47.463
to lead us
down this route, unless...

20:48.072 --> 20:49.030
Unless what?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.859
...unless he's leading us
into a trap.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.166
Well, that's
a pretty big assumption, Ahmed.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.429
Deduction, not assumption.

20:58.605 --> 20:59.780
Now you're teachin' me English?

21:01.216 --> 21:02.304
North side clear.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.090
I've been thinking
about all the possible reasons

21:06.090 --> 21:07.570
why he'd take this route.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.529
All the answers smell bad.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.574
He lied about the road
being washed out.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.620
The rainfalls
didn't affect this area.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.361
Haadee's been vetted.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.797
You can say
whatever you want, Sergeant.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.494
We just don't
wanna go down this road.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.063
You're out of
your bounds, Ahmed.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.107
You're here to translate.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.285
Actually, I'm here
to interpret.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.292
All right.
You wanna be right, Ahmed?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.642
- Hey, Jizzy.
Check the drone.
- On it.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.513
JJ, Tom Cat,

21:37.513 --> 21:38.775
go up to the top
of those rocks there

21:38.775 --> 21:39.950
- and tell me what you see.
-  Copy that.

21:42.692 --> 21:45.782
Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2,
this is Havoc 3-3.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.480
<i>Havoc 3-3,</i>

21:47.480 --> 21:49.699
<i>- this is Viper 6-2, over.</i>
- Roger. We need
live imagery now.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.702
Why have we stopped?
The road is safe.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.400
What are we waiting for, John?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.576
I'm waitin' to hear if there's
a fuckin' ambush up ahead.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.671
<i>ETA, ten minutes.</i>

22:04.671 --> 22:06.890
Look, I haven't got
ten minutes.
We need the imagery now.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.283
<i>Roger that.</i>

22:08.283 --> 22:10.372
<i>Grid to mark, 4-5.</i>

22:15.072 --> 22:16.073
<i>JJ?</i>

22:17.336 --> 22:18.293
All clear.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.251
Tom Cat?

22:21.905 --> 22:23.516
All clear, too.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.082
- It's clear.
-  <i>6-2 for Havoc 3-3,</i>

22:25.082 --> 22:26.997
<i>- we're live.</i>
- Viper 6-2, imagery received.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.782
- Havoc 3-3, out.
-  <i>Roger.</i>

22:28.782 --> 22:30.436
Okay,
what do we got here?

22:30.436 --> 22:32.263
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Ahmed, stop!
Get the fuck off!

22:32.263 --> 22:34.004
Get the fuck off Haadee! John!

22:34.004 --> 22:35.397
Get the fuck off of him, Ahmed!

22:35.397 --> 22:37.225
- Put the fucking gun down!
-  Hey! Hey!

22:37.225 --> 22:38.531
Get that gun out of his throat!

22:40.881 --> 22:41.882
He's a traitor.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.318
I don't give a fuck what he is.

22:43.318 --> 22:45.320
You take that gun
out of his throat.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.977
He gave up our position.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.762
Take the gun out of his throat.

23:02.729 --> 23:05.384
I am not gonna ask you again.

24:00.047 --> 24:01.265
He says they have his family.

24:04.355 --> 24:05.705
<i>John,
you're not gonna like this.</i>

24:06.270 --> 24:07.750
What is it?

24:07.750 --> 24:08.838
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

24:10.492 --> 24:11.798
What the fuck is it?

24:11.798 --> 24:13.060
<i>Looks like an ambush.</i>

24:13.060 --> 24:14.888
<i>Tali kill box
eight klicks up this road.</i>

24:22.156 --> 24:23.244
All right,
let's turn this thing around.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.115
- Get back to base.
-  <i>Copy.</i>

24:29.293 --> 24:30.294
Get in the truck.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.256
Pick him up.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.833
<i>Look what I got, Daddy.
Look what I got.</i>

24:46.833 --> 24:49.444
<i>It's from Johnny's dad.</i>

24:49.444 --> 24:51.794
<i>- Why are you going to bed
at lunchtime?</i>

24:51.794 --> 24:53.709
No, baby.
Time is different here,
you remember?

24:53.709 --> 24:55.624
I'm ten hours ahead of you.
It's nighttime.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.408
<i>I miss you.</i>

24:57.408 --> 24:58.801
I miss you, too. All of you.

24:59.541 --> 25:00.977
Hey, kids?

25:00.977 --> 25:03.066
You let me talk to Mommy
for just a second?

25:03.066 --> 25:04.677
<i>I'll be out
in a minute.</i>

25:04.677 --> 25:06.069
-  <i>Love you, Daddy.</i>
-  <i>Love you, Daddy.</i>

25:06.069 --> 25:08.202
I love you, too.
Have a good rest of your day.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.294
<i>- Hey, sweetheart.</i>
- Hey, babe.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.730
How's... how's business?

25:14.730 --> 25:16.297
<i>Well, it's... it's good.</i>

25:16.297 --> 25:18.647
<i>We have bookings
for the next six weeks
and beyond.</i>

25:18.647 --> 25:20.344
- That's good news.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

25:20.344 --> 25:21.781
How are the books?

25:21.781 --> 25:23.478
<i>We're up on last quarter.</i>

25:23.478 --> 25:26.350
So, you're all over it.
You're all over it.

25:26.350 --> 25:29.049
<i>Oh, you know me,
of course I am.</i>

25:29.049 --> 25:31.094
Just another one
of the reasons I love you.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.532
<i>Well, you know how much
I love you, John.</i>

25:33.532 --> 25:35.490
<i>- Just hurry up and get home.</i>
-  Yeah.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.120
Are you okay?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.426
Yes, yes, I'm good.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.298
Sit, sit.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.300
You must rest.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.521
Do you want me
to get you something?

26:08.131 --> 26:09.872
I could eat some more.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.485
Leave it to me.

26:16.444 --> 26:19.099
Did you hear
about Hadyah's son?

26:19.099 --> 26:20.361
What happened to him?

26:20.361 --> 26:22.798
He's joined the Taliban.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.453
And he won't talk
to her anymore.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.803
When I saw her she was crying.

26:27.803 --> 26:30.763
Poor woman, first she loses
her husband, now this.

26:32.373 --> 26:35.071
I'm worried about him, Ahmed.

26:35.071 --> 26:38.771
What about
our Special Immigration Visas?

26:40.120 --> 26:42.557
It takes time. Don't worry.

26:45.386 --> 26:46.387
Hey.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.522
I'm on it.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.529
- Ease up 'til they get back.
- Sir?

26:59.139 --> 27:00.444
John.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.057
Interpreter came through, huh?

27:04.057 --> 27:06.537
Just don't know
how wild he is.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.975
Yeah, well, he still saved
eight people's lives.

27:09.802 --> 27:10.803
Yes, he did.

27:11.586 --> 27:12.631
So, what's your next move?

27:13.849 --> 27:16.591
- Second location,
120 klicks away.
- Awesome.

27:16.591 --> 27:19.159
Three hours in a Humvee should
be fun for the old back.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.075
Well, you could give us
a couple of birds.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.642
Yeah.

27:24.686 --> 27:25.644
No.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.386
Happy hunting.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.522
Thank you, sir.

27:41.616 --> 27:44.401
Why do the Talib always seem
to have their arms cache
hundred clicks from our base?

27:44.401 --> 27:47.056
Jizzy's hemorrhoids
won't be able to take it.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.101
<i>All right, look.</i>

27:48.101 --> 27:49.711
This is our fourth tour here...

27:49.711 --> 27:52.235
And what have we achieved apart
from losing Jack Jack?

27:52.235 --> 27:54.977
Even if we do find shit
that goes bang...

27:54.977 --> 27:57.545
You think it's gonna make
a difference or bring him back?

27:58.894 --> 28:01.070
What's that got to do
with Jizzy's hemorrhoids?

28:02.332 --> 28:03.638
Why are you always
talking about ass Tom Cat?

28:04.813 --> 28:05.727
Where do you think
he got the name Tom Cat?

28:08.425 --> 28:09.383
We're here.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.169
Nothing like
a three-hour drive.

28:13.169 --> 28:14.997
<i>All right,
we're 120 clicks from base,</i>

28:14.997 --> 28:16.956
<i>and 30 minutes
from air support,</i>

28:16.956 --> 28:19.480
<i>so, uh, do a final
comms check, Tom Cat.</i>

28:19.480 --> 28:21.395
Roger that. Comms clear, John.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.406
Put your fuckin' hands up now!

28:32.406 --> 28:33.799
Get your fuckin' hands up now!

28:33.799 --> 28:34.713
Put your hands up!

28:34.713 --> 28:36.236
Get in line over here! Now!

28:41.545 --> 28:45.332
As you can see
I'm with the U.S. Army,
we're here to conduct a search.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.942
Are you the land owner?

28:48.030 --> 28:49.336
Yes, the land is mine.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.120
What are you looking for here?

28:51.120 --> 28:52.992
We're looking for explosives.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.385
Explosives?

28:55.385 --> 28:58.084
This is a closed mine.
There has not been
any explosives here for years.

28:58.084 --> 29:00.477
This shouldn't take long.
Thank you.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.396
Are you looking
for the Taliban?

29:06.396 --> 29:08.616
Yes, we're looking for Taliban.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.574
I knew this would happen.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.664
But you guys have come
to the wrong place.

29:13.664 --> 29:16.929
Down there's
another plantation.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.890
The Americans are here
at the mine.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.805
The Americans
have found the mine.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.459
Send the men there.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.548
More soldiers are coming.

29:27.548 --> 29:30.943
That's where you'll find
the people you are looking for.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.032
Thank you.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.337
We will check there next.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.383
Welcome.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.214
Something's not right.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.215
He's lying.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.437
Jizzy, hold what you got.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.612
Secure the area.
We're moving up.

29:48.612 --> 29:49.657
On it.

29:55.184 --> 29:56.316
-  Hey! Come here!

29:56.316 --> 29:58.405
Move! This guy was
on his phone!

29:58.405 --> 29:59.754
Give me that!
Put your hands on your head!

30:06.674 --> 30:07.849
On me.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.024
Kawa, pick up the rear.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.025
Roger.

30:17.728 --> 30:18.947
Everybody on the floor!

30:18.947 --> 30:20.775
- On the floor!
-  Get down! Now!

30:38.924 --> 30:40.664
Clear.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.623
Kawa, take over watch.
Keep eyes on the road.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.172
<i>John, it's Jizzy.</i>

31:10.172 --> 31:12.261
We found a big weapons cache
down here.
What do you wanna do?

31:13.262 --> 31:14.437
Secure those bodies,

31:14.437 --> 31:16.091
take up a security position
and stand by.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.092
<i>Copy.</i>

31:20.835 --> 31:22.402
Hands behind your backs!

31:22.402 --> 31:23.751
Get 'em on the floor!

31:23.751 --> 31:24.883
- Don't fuckin' move!
-  Get down!

31:24.883 --> 31:26.058
Tom Cat, JJ, cuff 'em.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.276
Kersher,
watch the fuckin' road.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.311
<i>No! No! No! No!</i>

32:03.791 --> 32:04.966
Tom Cat, it's John.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.055
We got an IED factory.

32:08.317 --> 32:09.536
Four Tangos.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.190
We need
air support immediately.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.192
We're goin' in.

32:13.192 --> 32:16.499
Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2,
this is Havoc 3-3.

32:16.499 --> 32:17.718
We've hit jackpot.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.373
Requesting immediate QRF. Over.

32:20.373 --> 32:23.332
<i>Copy,
Havoc 3-3, assigning QRF.</i>

32:23.332 --> 32:24.551
Ahmed, you stay here.

32:25.595 --> 32:26.901
We don't need a translator
for this.

32:39.479 --> 32:40.654
Fuckin' animals.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.096
It's Jack Jack's killer.

32:51.839 --> 32:52.927
Fuck!

32:52.927 --> 32:54.015
-  Fuck.
-  Fuck!

32:56.365 --> 32:58.498
- Clear. You all right?

32:58.498 --> 32:59.760
Motherfucker got me
in the arm.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.414
-  Ahmed! We good?
-  We're good.

33:01.414 --> 33:02.458
-  Fuck.
-  Watch the door.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.938
Fuck!

33:03.938 --> 33:05.244
Hold on, stay there.

33:15.210 --> 33:17.038
All right,
charge is set. Three minutes.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.474
- Let's go. Move.

33:18.474 --> 33:19.606
Move, move, move.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.131
Hold, hold.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.002
Move, move.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.489
All units, we have
a three-minute burning fuse.

33:33.489 --> 33:35.274
<i>Keep that 50-K locked
on the north road.</i>

33:35.274 --> 33:36.840
Copy that.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.625
-  Kawa, we are
on your left. Cover us--

33:39.278 --> 33:40.235
Shit!

33:45.632 --> 33:47.025
Eddie! Eddie!

33:52.987 --> 33:55.250
- Eddie's down.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.860
-  <i>Eddie's down.</i>
- Get 'em on their feet.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.166
- Get up!
- Get up right now!

33:58.166 --> 34:00.081
- Get up right now!
- Move!

34:00.081 --> 34:01.865
<i>We're at the top of the hill,
making our way to you.</i>

34:01.865 --> 34:03.171
Move him, move him.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.781
I don't want
the fuckin' Taliban to see him.

34:07.262 --> 34:08.959
<i>Steve, Talis approaching.</i>

34:08.959 --> 34:11.397
<i>- Eleven o'clock. Two SUVs.</i>
- Contact north!
Two Taliban trucks!

34:11.962 --> 34:13.399
Get in position.

34:13.399 --> 34:15.140
- Keep your eyes on the road!
-  <i>Copy!</i>

34:15.140 --> 34:16.228

34:19.666 --> 34:21.885

the north bridge!

34:21.885 --> 34:23.235
Contact left!

34:23.235 --> 34:24.714
On the ridge, Tom Cat!

34:30.720 --> 34:32.026
Keep your eyes on the road!

34:32.026 --> 34:33.810
Viper 6-2, Viper 6-2,

34:33.810 --> 34:36.117
<i>troops in contact.
I repeat, troops in contact!</i>

34:36.117 --> 34:38.337
<i>Viper 6-2,
we are 15 minutes out.</i>

34:40.817 --> 34:42.036
<i>First truck has arrived</i>

34:42.036 --> 34:43.211
<i>at the left
at the north entrance.</i>

34:53.134 --> 34:55.049
Kersher's down.
Tom Cat, get on the gun!

34:56.311 --> 34:58.531
<i>Go! Go!
Steve is down. Over.</i>

34:58.531 --> 34:59.923
Hold position. Coming to you.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.664

<i>JJ's down!</i>

Fuck!

36:14.781 --> 36:15.912
Move!

36:21.831 --> 36:23.659
John! John! We need a plan now!

36:24.965 --> 36:27.054
You have an SUV coming.
We'll cover you.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.969
Take that truck,
go to higher ground,

36:28.969 --> 36:30.144
and take a position.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.456
<i>John,
we're fuckin' pinned!</i>

36:37.456 --> 36:38.500
Move. Move.

36:41.547 --> 36:42.548
Cover me!

36:51.948 --> 36:53.254
-  Jizzy, go, go!

36:54.168 --> 36:55.952
Ahmed, get in! Get in!

37:00.566 --> 37:02.263
<i>John, follow me.</i>

37:02.263 --> 37:03.569
<i>Straight ahead.
We'll punch up the--</i>

37:06.485 --> 37:08.574
Fuck. Jizzy! Jizzy!

37:25.721 --> 37:26.809
Control this.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.508
Dagger 1-2.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.771
Dagger 1-2,
this is Dagger 3-3. Come in.

37:37.559 --> 37:38.952
We're out of range.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.997
Dagger 1-2, Dagger 1-2,

37:40.997 --> 37:42.564
this is Dagger 3-3. Come in.

37:42.564 --> 37:43.565
Fuck!

37:45.480 --> 37:46.655
Ah, shit!

37:46.655 --> 37:47.613
We've got a flat.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.922
All right,
we have to abandon ship.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.628
Ahmed. Ahmed.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.688
We've found their car,
they're on foot.

38:19.688 --> 38:23.257
I will send everyone,
go after them and kill them.

38:23.257 --> 38:24.476
I want them alive.

38:25.912 --> 38:26.826
Get them alive.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.219
Spread out, find them.

39:03.471 --> 39:06.039
Havoc actual.
Havoc actual.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.214
<i>Roger.</i>

39:07.214 --> 39:09.216
This is Viper 6-2.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.914
We have approximately
40 KIA Taliban.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.481
We recovered all 3-3 bodies,

39:13.481 --> 39:15.875
minus John Kinley
and the interpreter. Over.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.584
I think we're good
for now.

40:41.656 --> 40:42.831
We'll rest here for the night.

41:29.269 --> 41:30.400
Here's the challenge.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.577
The satnav says
the beer is 120 clicks

41:32.577 --> 41:34.796
in that direction
over shit terrain.

41:34.796 --> 41:37.407
And Taliban are everywhere,
so we can't use the roads.

41:37.407 --> 41:40.367
They will be on us
in two minutes.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.238
We're not walking,
we're double-timing. You good?

41:43.239 --> 41:44.502
I'm good.

42:07.699 --> 42:08.613
They're on us.

42:09.570 --> 42:10.571
Gun up?

42:10.571 --> 42:12.138
- Gun's up.

42:12.138 --> 42:13.269
Let's move.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.321
Where's your fuckin' gun?

43:06.366 --> 43:07.541
Halfway up the hill.

43:10.065 --> 43:11.371
This belongs to you now.

43:11.371 --> 43:12.807
Just don't lose it.

43:13.721 --> 43:14.853
You ready?

43:14.853 --> 43:16.115
Following you, boss.

44:36.195 --> 44:37.283
Rifle.

44:40.939 --> 44:41.896
Let's go.

45:59.234 --> 46:00.279
Hey.

46:01.323 --> 46:02.324
Is he dead?

46:03.891 --> 46:04.849
Yeah.

46:07.068 --> 46:08.069
Get him up.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.211
It fuckin' stinks in there.

49:18.433 --> 49:19.608
We'll rack up here
for the night.

49:22.046 --> 49:23.438
Listen my brothers.

49:24.831 --> 49:26.572
You will find them.

49:27.529 --> 49:29.836
God is with you,
not the infidels.

49:31.055 --> 49:34.319
They are the enemy
of our prophet.

49:35.711 --> 49:37.975
They are a long way
from their base.

49:38.932 --> 49:42.718
They will never get home.

49:42.718 --> 49:45.112
It is your duty
to bring them to justice.

49:46.592 --> 49:48.986
I want them brought
to me alive.

50:38.774 --> 50:39.862
They see a house.

50:43.649 --> 50:45.042
We haven't seen too many
of those.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.223
If we can hear them,

50:53.702 --> 50:54.964
they gotta be close.

50:59.491 --> 51:00.579
Pack up your shit.

51:51.325 --> 51:52.457
Ahmed.

52:35.935 --> 52:37.023
Stop him

52:38.764 --> 52:39.852
I must kill him.

52:39.852 --> 52:40.853
Calm down brother.

52:40.853 --> 52:41.810
He must die.

52:41.810 --> 52:43.072
We need him alive.

52:43.072 --> 52:44.030
Calm down.

52:44.030 --> 52:45.336
Calm?

54:46.935 --> 54:47.936
Hey.

54:53.072 --> 54:53.986
John.

54:55.727 --> 54:56.684
We're going home.

54:59.557 --> 55:00.775
It's gonna be a long journey.

55:03.604 --> 55:04.953
<i>We can't take the roads.</i>

55:07.260 --> 55:08.435
<i>They know we're here.</i>

55:11.395 --> 55:13.658
<i>More men will be coming here
in trucks.</i>

56:44.966 --> 56:45.793
Here you go.

57:46.201 --> 57:48.465
We've broken down,
we need a ride.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.597
Okay, I will take you
anywhere you want.

57:54.079 --> 57:56.385
Drive a few kilometers
up this road.

57:56.385 --> 57:57.735
Okay, I will take you.

58:00.346 --> 58:02.087
What are you doing
out here brother?

58:02.087 --> 58:06.178
Looking for two men,
an American and the other,
a Muslim traitor.

58:06.178 --> 58:07.701
Have you seen
anyone suspicious?

58:07.701 --> 58:11.096
I have seen no one,
these roads are quiet.

58:11.096 --> 58:13.664
I am surprised to see even you.

58:13.664 --> 58:16.362
We will find them,
this is our territory.

58:19.104 --> 58:20.366
What's in the back?

58:20.975 --> 58:23.064
I'm a rug seller.

58:23.064 --> 58:24.457
Are you interested?

58:25.632 --> 58:26.546
Just drive.

58:38.471 --> 58:40.604
Stop the truck.

58:45.434 --> 58:46.653
Thank you.

58:47.959 --> 58:49.264
Peace be upon you.

59:08.980 --> 59:10.372
Peace be upon you.

59:13.637 --> 59:16.248
Hello brother, how are you?

59:16.248 --> 59:18.511
Good thank you.

59:18.511 --> 59:20.992
I apologize
for disturbing your meal.

59:22.210 --> 59:23.255
Sit.

59:23.951 --> 59:24.952
Thank you.

59:27.215 --> 59:29.000
Did you hunt those?

59:30.305 --> 59:32.569
You shall feast tonight.

59:36.311 --> 59:40.533
Brother, I have a friend
in the truck, he's hurt.

59:41.360 --> 59:43.144
How can I help?

59:43.144 --> 59:46.713
We need some food
and some pain relief.

59:48.019 --> 59:50.761
And if you give me
your wooden kart...

59:51.588 --> 59:53.851
I will give you my truck.

59:57.332 --> 59:58.725
May I see your friend?

59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.988
Of course.

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:17.004
So you're the two
they are looking for.

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:22.183
I don't like Taliban.

01:00:22.183 --> 01:00:24.142
I will help you.

01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:25.839
He needs opium.

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.321
It will ease his pain.

01:00:31.149 --> 01:00:32.019
Thank you.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.937
There's a heavy price
on your heads.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:39.810
They have hundreds of Taliban
looking for you.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:41.725
They have been
village to village,

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:44.989
setting fire to those
that give no information.

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:47.469
They will not stop hunting you.

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:51.473
You are a long way
from his base.

01:00:51.473 --> 01:00:55.086
Do not use the roads,
patrols are everywhere.

01:00:56.217 --> 01:00:58.742
You must use
the mountain passes.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.154
Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you.

01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:02.420
Would you like something?

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:05.553
Give me the water.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:09.993
Thank you.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.895
Peace be upon you.

01:05:42.895 --> 01:05:44.201
Peace be upon you.

01:05:46.203 --> 01:05:47.117
Hello brother.

01:05:48.814 --> 01:05:49.946
Give me water.

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.036
Hey, catch.

01:07:21.211 --> 01:07:22.516
Put your fucking hands up!

01:07:22.516 --> 01:07:23.561
Hands up!

01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:24.736
Get down on the ground!

01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:28.305
Get down on the ground!

01:07:28.305 --> 01:07:29.567
Get the fuck down!

01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:30.524
Get down!

01:07:31.308 --> 01:07:32.265
Stay down!

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:34.224
Look away!

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:37.314
I have one of yours.

01:07:37.314 --> 01:07:39.620
- He's in the cart.
- Check the cart.

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:47.672
It's John fuckin' Kinley.

01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:50.240
Hey! Hey,
it's John fuckin' Kinley.
We need a medic over here!

01:08:11.217 --> 01:08:13.306
<i>Dr. Kale, please dial 1-1-8.</i>

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.355
<i>We're going home.</i>

01:08:19.617 --> 01:08:21.271
<i>We're going home.</i>

01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:23.447
<i>We're going home.</i>

01:08:25.579 --> 01:08:27.277
<i>Dr. Kale, please dial 1-1-8.</i>

01:08:36.721 --> 01:08:38.636
<i>Welcome home, Mr. Kinley.</i>

01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:40.377
<i>- I'll get your doctor.</i>

01:09:00.701 --> 01:09:01.746
Heard they're
giving you a medal,

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:04.923
Distinguished Service Cross.

01:09:04.923 --> 01:09:06.359
-  Come on,
put it away, guys.
- That was quick.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.448
-  Dinner's in five.
-  Well,

01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:10.058
you did crawl
on your hands and knees

01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:11.799
over broken glass
for a 100 clicks, so...

01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:15.238
If I did,
I don't remember any of it.

01:09:17.065 --> 01:09:19.372
You still don't remember
a thing?

01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:21.548
I mean, I remember waking up
in the hospital.

01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:24.334
So, why should they
give me a medal?
They should give it to him.

01:09:25.596 --> 01:09:28.947
As far as I know,
I was just a passenger.

01:09:28.947 --> 01:09:31.602
I don't think
it's a medal he wants
as much as a visa he needs.

01:09:34.561 --> 01:09:36.476
Well, what's goin' on
with that?

01:09:36.476 --> 01:09:39.087
Well, even if we can get
the visa,
we still gotta find him first.

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:40.045
Find him?

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:44.919
Where'd he go?

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:46.878
Well, after your little hike
in Afghanistan,

01:09:46.878 --> 01:09:49.489
Ahmed found himself
a local folk hero

01:09:49.489 --> 01:09:51.622
to everyone, but the Taliban.

01:09:51.622 --> 01:09:53.972
Let's just say,
they're not pleased
he dragged you 100 clicks

01:09:53.972 --> 01:09:57.149
across their territory,
and they were unable
to catch you.

01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:59.673
Your story has developed
something of a following
among the populous.

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:02.285
What's that look like?

01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:03.895
He ended up
on their top ten
most-wanted list

01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:06.245
with a price on his head.

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:07.725
Disappeared and went
underground with his family.

01:10:17.474 --> 01:10:19.302
Before you ask,

01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:21.260
I reached out
to his smack-dealing brother.

01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:24.045
I sense he knows where he is,

01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:26.657
but he's not gonna give us
that information
until we get Ahmed a visa.

01:10:28.485 --> 01:10:33.098
Ahmed. Ahmed Abdullah.

01:10:33.098 --> 01:10:34.491
<i>And how are you
spelling that, sir?</i>

01:10:34.491 --> 01:10:35.840
Yeah, A-B-D...

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.276
Yes, I know, ma'am. I...

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:38.625
<i>Has his visa been approved?</i>

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:40.888
Mr. Abdullah was... was set
to have his visa issued.

01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:42.673
<i>And the name, sir?</i>
- Ahmed.

01:10:42.673 --> 01:10:44.109
<i>Your friend needs to fill out</i>

01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:45.806
<i>- an I-360 form.</i>
- I-I can't get him
on the phone.

01:10:45.806 --> 01:10:47.765
His... his family have
been forced into hiding.

01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:49.462
- Ma'am, I've explained
this situation to...
-  <i>Just one minute.</i>

01:10:49.462 --> 01:10:52.117
- ...your supervisor already.
Can you not...
<i>- Just one minute.</i>

01:10:52.117 --> 01:10:53.510
<i>- Just gonna put you
on hold, sir.</i>
- Can you...

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:55.903
How are you supposed to do
a background check

01:10:55.903 --> 01:10:57.862
on a three-month-old child?

01:10:57.862 --> 01:11:01.953
Can you not put me on hold?
I have been holding
for one and a half hours.

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:03.171
<i>Just one minute.</i>

01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:22.582
Well, first we have to
figure out how to make sure
their visas are issued,

01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:24.323
and then I can figure out
how to find them.

01:11:24.323 --> 01:11:27.283
Would you leave your wife
and child behind? Would you?

01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:31.069
<i>He disappeared and went
underground with his family.</i>

01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:33.114
<i>He disappeared and went
underground with his family,</i>

01:11:33.114 --> 01:11:34.246
<i>because of you.</i>

01:11:34.246 --> 01:11:35.943
<i>- Because of you.</i>

01:11:35.943 --> 01:11:37.380
I just gave you
all that information.

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.207
I literally just gave that
to your supervisor.

01:11:39.207 --> 01:11:40.383
No, I'm not related.

01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:41.862
He's in Afghanistan...

01:11:41.862 --> 01:11:43.081
<i>Just
gonna put you on hold, sir.</i>

01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:44.561
- Fuckin' hold music!

01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:46.084
You leave people on hold
for an hour and a half,

01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:47.215
<i>they're gonna get frustrated.</i>

01:11:50.001 --> 01:11:51.481
Yes, ma'am. Yeah.

01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:53.178
Yes, I have
the letter right here.

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.179
<i>From Colonel Masters?</i>
- That's correct.

01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:55.441
Yeah.
It's from Colonel Masters.

01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:56.790
Okay, so yeah, well then
how long will that be?

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:58.139
<i>It's a minimum
nine months, sir.</i>

01:11:58.139 --> 01:12:00.838
They...
they can't wait nine months!

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.709
If they wait nine months,
they will be dead!

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.586
- Good night, boss.
- Hey, I'll lock up, Miguel.

01:12:09.586 --> 01:12:11.457
I'll lock up.

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:12.719
<i>You're through to USCIS,</i>

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:14.330
<i>- how can I help you, sir?</i>
- Uh...

01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:18.072
Are you gonna put me
on hold again?

01:12:18.072 --> 01:12:19.596
- Yeah, go ahead
and put me on hold again.
<i>- If you could just bear</i>

01:12:19.596 --> 01:12:20.945
<i>with me for one minute, sir.</i>

01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:22.555
Don't, don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

01:12:22.555 --> 01:12:24.122
Don't put the phone down.

01:12:24.122 --> 01:12:24.862
- Don't put
the fucking phone down.
<i>- It will just take</i>

01:12:24.862 --> 01:12:26.820
<i>one moment, Sergeant.</i>

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.821
<i>- I will find someone
that can help you.</i>
- You put... You fucking put me

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:29.997
on hold again,
and I will find you.

01:12:31.825 --> 01:12:33.523
Put me on hold! Come on!

01:12:33.523 --> 01:12:36.177
What's
your fucking name, huh?

01:12:36.177 --> 01:12:38.049
<i>What's your name?</i>

01:12:38.049 --> 01:12:41.531
I will come
to your fuckin' house,
and I will find you!

01:12:43.054 --> 01:12:46.753
There's a fuckin' man stuck
in a goddamn cave!

01:12:46.753 --> 01:12:48.233
I will find you!

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:17.131
<i>Drink this.</i>

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:31.624
<i>You're okay.</i>

01:14:39.518 --> 01:14:40.345
<i>Hey.</i>

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:43.653
<i>Quiet.</i>

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:16.686
John?

01:15:21.212 --> 01:15:22.213
John.

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:33.659
As if it wasn't enough
for him to carry me
across those mountains,

01:15:33.659 --> 01:15:35.531
now I can't get him
out of my fuckin' head.

01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:47.499
I'm lying in this bed.

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:53.157
I kiss my children
before they go to school.

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:57.074
And he's hiding
in a hole somewhere.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:01.426
A hole he can never get out of.

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:03.471
A hole that we put him in.

01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:09.956
And that wasn't the deal.

01:16:09.956 --> 01:16:13.003
The deal was that we offered
his family sanctuary.

01:16:15.179 --> 01:16:16.615
Then we tied a noose
around his neck

01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:18.443
and we kicked the stool
out from under him.

01:16:27.147 --> 01:16:28.758
I should be
in that hole.

01:16:38.071 --> 01:16:39.638
You think he blessed you?

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.122
Well, he fuckin' cursed me.

01:16:51.650 --> 01:16:55.567
I am a man who gets no rest.

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:05.490
<i>Please continue to hold.</i>

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:07.100
<i>Your call is in a queue.</i>

01:17:09.799 --> 01:17:11.409
<i>Please continue to hold.</i>

01:17:11.409 --> 01:17:12.410
<i>Your call is in a...</i>

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.807
We both know
how this is gonna end.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:24.074
I am gonna have
to get him out myself.

01:17:27.512 --> 01:17:28.513
I know a guy.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.691
Parker.
Private security contractor.

01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:37.653
I hear he's very good,
and he can help you.

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.613
But it's gonna cost.

01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:43.920
We'll have to give you
a different name
and background.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.314
If the Talibs find out that
you're back in the country,
they'll know why.

01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:49.360
And they'll throw everything
they have at finding you both.

01:18:20.478 --> 01:18:21.522
Hello.

01:18:23.437 --> 01:18:24.525
Taliban are here.

01:18:26.919 --> 01:18:27.920
Where?

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.661
They are a few doors down.

01:18:30.618 --> 01:18:33.186
- Get out of there.
- Basira.

01:18:34.144 --> 01:18:36.189
I will have to move you again.

01:18:36.973 --> 01:18:38.583
Leave now.

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:39.715
Yes, I know, I know.

01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:42.935
Basira the bag, the bag.

01:18:43.457 --> 01:18:44.284
Let's go.

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:50.769
They've executed Abdi.

01:18:56.557 --> 01:18:57.907
Your house is next.

01:18:57.907 --> 01:18:59.343
Let's go, let's go.

01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:03.173
Taliban heading towards you.

01:19:03.173 --> 01:19:04.217
Wait, wait.

01:19:04.217 --> 01:19:05.392
- Where, where?

01:19:05.392 --> 01:19:06.611
He's approaching
the back entrance.

01:19:06.611 --> 01:19:07.786
Wait.

01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:13.009
He's twenty feet
from the door.

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:20.494
Twelve feet.

01:19:41.124 --> 01:19:43.779
Three Taliban heading
towards your front door.

01:19:52.352 --> 01:19:53.919
The back door is clear.

01:19:58.619 --> 01:20:00.273
They're in your house.

01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:03.711
Out the back, turn right.

01:20:04.843 --> 01:20:05.844
I see you.

01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:13.330
Get down,
more Taliban are here.

01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:22.600
Move, now.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.105
-  Mornin', boss.
- Mornin'.

01:20:50.671 --> 01:20:52.151
I could only find three
of these.

01:20:54.284 --> 01:20:55.720
I swear there's two more
around here.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.504
All right.

01:20:57.504 --> 01:20:59.898
So, you know where
to find us
if there's a problem.

01:20:59.898 --> 01:21:01.421
-  Great. Thank you.
- Pleasure doing business
with you.

01:21:01.421 --> 01:21:02.553
Bye.

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:05.251
Mr. Kinley.

01:21:06.296 --> 01:21:07.558
Mrs. Kinley.

01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:16.784
Looks like you've
got everything under control.

01:21:17.394 --> 01:21:18.917
Mm-hmm.

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:21.093
The Cadillac will be ready
this afternoon.

01:21:21.093 --> 01:21:24.053
and the Harleys will be
picked up at six o'clock.

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:28.709
Guess you don't
need me then.

01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:30.711
Nope.

01:21:30.711 --> 01:21:31.974
But you sure look purty.

01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:36.848
I'm gonna go...

01:21:38.981 --> 01:21:40.373
put on something sexy.

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:24.591
I know and have accepted
what you do, John.

01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:28.639
We've had this conversation
many times.

01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:33.557
I've said goodbye to you,

01:22:33.557 --> 01:22:36.429
not knowing
if I'm going to see you again.

01:22:36.429 --> 01:22:40.303
And I've been doing this
for 12 years.

01:22:41.608 --> 01:22:42.958
But this time, it's different.

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:50.313
This family believed
that you were dead.

01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:55.535
We suffered this news
for three weeks.

01:22:57.842 --> 01:22:59.931
Do you know what the children
and I went through?

01:23:02.455 --> 01:23:04.762
But you have put me
in an impossible position.

01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:07.808
Being your wife is one thing,

01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:10.855
but being their mother,
it's... it's something else.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.990
We owe that man your life.

01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:22.954
So, we will remortgage
the house,

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.217
you'll get those visas,

01:23:25.957 --> 01:23:27.002
and you will go.

01:23:28.046 --> 01:23:29.395
And you will do
what you have to.

01:23:32.442 --> 01:23:33.530
You'll come back alive.

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:38.752
You'll come back alive,
John Kinley.

01:23:59.077 --> 01:24:01.210
Colonel. Declan.

01:24:01.210 --> 01:24:02.646
John, please, have a seat.

01:24:06.867 --> 01:24:08.043
Everything all right, John?

01:24:10.915 --> 01:24:12.177
No, everything's not all right.

01:24:13.004 --> 01:24:14.005
Have a seat.

01:24:14.005 --> 01:24:15.876
I'd rather stand,
if you don't mind.

01:24:20.751 --> 01:24:25.886
So, you seem
to have been making
a lot of noise lately.

01:24:25.886 --> 01:24:28.367
<i>What's your fucking name? Huh?</i>

01:24:28.367 --> 01:24:31.109
-  <i>Sergeant, there is no--</i>
-  <i>What's your name?</i>

01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:32.676
-  <i>It's First Officer Cowell.</i>
-  <i>I will come</i>

01:24:32.676 --> 01:24:34.025
<i>to your fucking house,</i>

01:24:34.025 --> 01:24:35.896
<i>and I will find you!</i>

01:24:35.896 --> 01:24:37.724
<i>Sergeant,
please calm down.</i>

01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:41.424
<i>There's
a fucking man stuck
in a goddamn cave!</i>

01:24:41.424 --> 01:24:43.991
<i>Sir, I assure you,
we're doing everything we can.</i>

01:24:43.991 --> 01:24:45.558
<i>Fuckin' hole and...</i>

01:24:48.648 --> 01:24:50.563
There's been a,
uh, official complaint.

01:24:52.304 --> 01:24:53.653
Oh, I see.

01:24:53.653 --> 01:24:55.873
You brought me here
for an intervention.

01:24:57.701 --> 01:24:59.485
Or to slap my wrist.

01:25:01.357 --> 01:25:02.445
That's not why I'm here.

01:25:04.882 --> 01:25:08.799
You think if I could be shot
of this debt, I wouldn't be?

01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:15.936
Do you think if I could just
go through the usual channels,
I wouldn't?

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:21.594
That is not how
this debt works.

01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:28.471
It demands a result,
not an appeasement.

01:25:33.084 --> 01:25:36.696
There is a hook in me.

01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:42.093
One that you cannot see.

01:25:45.531 --> 01:25:46.532
But it is there.

01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:53.452
And you think I have a choice?

01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:57.891
There is no fuckin' choice.

01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:03.419
I am going to get that man
and his family

01:26:03.419 --> 01:26:06.683
out of the position
that we put him in.

01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:11.514
And of that, I have no doubt.

01:26:15.082 --> 01:26:16.301
And you're gonna
help me, Colonel.

01:26:19.304 --> 01:26:23.047
The reason that I am here...

01:26:29.271 --> 01:26:30.968
I saved your life
eight years ago.

01:26:33.797 --> 01:26:35.233
So you're gonna
get those visas.

01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:37.235
I don't know how.

01:26:38.584 --> 01:26:39.846
But you're gonna get them.

01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:45.548
Because I know
you are the type of man

01:26:47.245 --> 01:26:48.290
that pays his debts.

01:26:55.079 --> 01:26:56.036
Pay your debts.

01:27:22.454 --> 01:27:23.542
I love you both so much.

01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:24.891
I'm gonna
miss you, Daddy.

01:27:24.891 --> 01:27:25.979
I'm gonna miss you.

01:27:25.979 --> 01:27:27.024
I'll miss you, too.

01:27:28.547 --> 01:27:29.461
Okay.

01:27:35.337 --> 01:27:36.512
We are gonna miss you, John.

01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:40.559
I know. I'll be back in a week.

01:27:43.301 --> 01:27:44.215
Come here.

01:27:47.349 --> 01:27:48.175
Kiss me.

01:28:18.554 --> 01:28:20.207
Ron Kay? Vokes' man?

01:28:20.207 --> 01:28:21.208
Parker, yeah?

01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:22.384
- Yeah.
- I hear good things.

01:28:25.561 --> 01:28:26.953
So, we set?

01:28:26.953 --> 01:28:30.609
Well, I've contacted
Ahmed's brother, Ali.

01:28:30.609 --> 01:28:33.264
He says he's found the village
that Ahmed's at,

01:28:33.264 --> 01:28:35.832
but he's had
no contact directly yet.

01:28:35.832 --> 01:28:36.833
So, we're goin' to the brother?

01:28:38.878 --> 01:28:40.227
Yeah, well, that was the plan.

01:28:41.446 --> 01:28:43.318
Was?

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.320
We've been pulled away
to do another job.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.625
We have a contract, Parker.

01:28:46.625 --> 01:28:48.323
We have an agreement.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.454
And I need you to honor it.

01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:50.629
This outranks me.

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:53.066
It comes from the top.

01:28:53.066 --> 01:28:55.895
We got a UN diplomat,
got his detail in hot water,

01:28:55.895 --> 01:28:57.593
we gotta deal with it.
That's all there is to it.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:03.468
Listen, you hold up here
for three days,

01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:05.470
my team's all yours.

01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:07.211
That's not how
this contract works, brother.

01:29:09.213 --> 01:29:12.303
In three days,
a warm body turns cold.

01:29:12.303 --> 01:29:16.002
And I know
it's not ten million dollars,
but you said, "Yes."

01:29:16.002 --> 01:29:19.354
And I'm two pints of blood
and a 150k in the hole.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.965
Well, Ron, if you're not happy,
you can take your money back.

01:29:21.965 --> 01:29:23.662
Oh, no, I'm definitely
not fuckin' happy.

01:29:26.099 --> 01:29:27.144
I don't want the money.

01:29:29.015 --> 01:29:32.236
I want you
to honor the fuckin' deal.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:35.370
I hear you have
an impressive team.

01:29:36.414 --> 01:29:37.633
Now I need you
to back yourself.

01:29:42.942 --> 01:29:43.987
All right, listen.

01:29:44.683 --> 01:29:45.641
Let's, uh...

01:29:46.903 --> 01:29:48.948
compromise, shall we?

01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:52.778
If you can find Ahmed
and his family,

01:29:52.778 --> 01:29:55.302
call us with the location,
we'll come in,

01:29:55.302 --> 01:29:56.782
airlift you out,
get you back to base,

01:29:56.782 --> 01:29:58.741
put you
on the next transport home.

01:29:58.741 --> 01:29:59.829
Done.

01:30:01.004 --> 01:30:02.005
You just gotta find him.

01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:03.136
I see how this works.

01:30:05.182 --> 01:30:08.141
I pay you
so I can wash the car.

01:30:08.141 --> 01:30:10.492
Come on, man.
You know how to adapt.

01:30:10.492 --> 01:30:12.885
Use what you got,
and this is what you got.

01:30:12.885 --> 01:30:16.541
Now, you can wait three days,
you get the full magazine.

01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:20.545
Or you can go now,
but you're goin' solo.

01:30:20.545 --> 01:30:24.027
I'll set you up.
I'll give you four good wheels
and a full set of tools,

01:30:25.289 --> 01:30:26.551
but you're gonna be alone.

01:30:29.119 --> 01:30:32.427
There's $10,000 cash
and a sat phone.

01:30:33.776 --> 01:30:36.431
You got an M-4 in the trunk,
with six magazines.

01:30:44.308 --> 01:30:46.266
You got a full tank of gas,

01:30:46.266 --> 01:30:48.355
satnav address
that's gonna take you to Ali.

01:30:48.355 --> 01:30:49.705
You can touch base
with him first.

01:30:51.794 --> 01:30:53.360
Ron, it's 72 hours.

01:30:55.362 --> 01:30:56.320
If I was you, I'd wait.

01:30:57.974 --> 01:30:59.454
Yeah, but you're not me.

01:31:00.846 --> 01:31:01.804
Are you, Parker?

01:32:09.088 --> 01:32:10.525
Ali,
are you accepting customers?

01:32:11.569 --> 01:32:13.092
John!
John, come in.

01:32:18.576 --> 01:32:20.186
Sit down, please.
Please sit down.

01:32:20.883 --> 01:32:21.884
Relax.

01:32:25.409 --> 01:32:26.497
Just a second.

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:32.895
Hassan!

01:32:36.115 --> 01:32:37.160
You want some tea?

01:32:42.644 --> 01:32:45.472
Do you know
what John means in my country?

01:32:48.998 --> 01:32:51.130
My dear. My love.

01:32:52.741 --> 01:32:55.570
My brother told me about
your beautiful blue eyes.

01:32:59.138 --> 01:33:00.749
You have beautiful blue eyes.

01:33:02.054 --> 01:33:04.796
Ahmed's son also
had beautiful blue eyes.

01:33:08.017 --> 01:33:08.931
Cigarette?

01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:35.653
The only reason
I haven't been tortured

01:33:37.046 --> 01:33:38.438
about the location
of my brother,

01:33:38.438 --> 01:33:42.921
is because I do a lot
of business with the Taliban.

01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:45.097
I guess you know what
I'm doing for a living, right?

01:33:47.404 --> 01:33:48.666
Yeah, I think I understand.

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.756
Hmm.

01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:58.284
You also understand my brother
has become very unpopular
with my partners.

01:33:58.284 --> 01:34:03.420
They don't like the fact
that the story of your rescue
has become so famous.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.205
Well, that's why I'm here. I...

01:34:07.293 --> 01:34:09.295
I feel bad about that.

01:34:09.295 --> 01:34:10.645
I owe your brother my life.

01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:16.041
If you can give me
the location of your brother

01:34:16.041 --> 01:34:17.695
I can get him
out of the country.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:23.135
Is that your truck there?

01:34:23.135 --> 01:34:25.398
You can't take that.
It's too dangerous.

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:28.097
I organized some transport.

01:34:29.402 --> 01:34:32.536
There's my truck driver,
his name is Pooya.

01:34:32.536 --> 01:34:35.365
He has a pass
to get him through
the Taliban checkpoints.

01:34:35.365 --> 01:34:38.934
However, sometimes,
they can be still difficult.

01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:42.546
When was the last time
you talked to your brother?

01:34:42.546 --> 01:34:44.243
A week ago.

01:34:46.115 --> 01:34:47.638
And he's due
to move in two days.

01:34:48.508 --> 01:34:50.467
But this is his last chance.

01:34:50.467 --> 01:34:52.208
The price on his head
is too great now.

01:35:02.784 --> 01:35:03.915
Good luck, John Kinley.

01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:05.917
Goodbye.

01:35:43.302 --> 01:35:44.739
Stay hidden. Stay hidden!

01:35:51.006 --> 01:35:52.050
Show us the papers.

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:56.620
- Make it quick.

01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:14.464
It's okay.

01:36:31.611 --> 01:36:33.091
Checkpoint! Checkpoint!

01:36:42.231 --> 01:36:43.406
Hello brothers.

01:36:44.886 --> 01:36:46.975
Turn off the engine.

01:36:52.371 --> 01:36:53.633
- Step out.
- What's the problem?

01:36:53.633 --> 01:36:54.983
- I said step out.
- I paid for this.

01:36:54.983 --> 01:36:55.940
Step out.

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.202
But, I paid for this.

01:37:00.466 --> 01:37:01.424
What's in your truck?

01:37:01.424 --> 01:37:02.381
I paid for this.

01:37:02.381 --> 01:37:03.774
I said what's in your truck?

01:37:03.774 --> 01:37:05.515
Corn boxes, I have brought them
for your brothers.

01:37:05.515 --> 01:37:06.908
- Delivering, where to?
- Jalalabad.

01:37:06.908 --> 01:37:07.778
So show us.

01:37:12.217 --> 01:37:13.262
Open this too.

01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:16.308
- You see.
- Be quiet son of a dog.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:21.487
There is nothing.

01:37:21.487 --> 01:37:22.749
Be quiet son of a dog.

01:37:31.367 --> 01:37:32.585
Take this money.

01:37:32.585 --> 01:37:36.328
I do not care about your money.

01:37:37.503 --> 01:37:38.591
Who are you to pay me?

01:37:39.418 --> 01:37:40.637
On your knees.

01:37:56.305 --> 01:37:57.784
You good?

01:37:57.784 --> 01:37:58.916
I thought we were dead.

01:38:03.225 --> 01:38:04.182
Let's get him outta here.

01:38:14.410 --> 01:38:15.933
Do you hear, Commander Satar?

01:38:15.933 --> 01:38:17.108
Fakhrudin?

01:38:17.108 --> 01:38:18.718
We have trouble.

01:38:18.718 --> 01:38:22.070
Two men have killed
our soldiers at the checkpoint.

01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:23.810
Find out who they are.

01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:24.899
I'll follow them.

01:38:24.899 --> 01:38:26.117
Keep in contact.

01:38:48.096 --> 01:38:49.271
<i>John?</i>

01:38:49.271 --> 01:38:50.359
<i>John, it's Vokes.</i>

01:38:51.012 --> 01:38:51.926
I got the visas.

01:38:53.579 --> 01:38:54.624
<i>Whole family.</i>

01:38:55.755 --> 01:38:57.279
I'm having them delivered
to Parker.

01:38:59.498 --> 01:39:00.891
- Good man.
<i>- John.</i>

01:39:02.414 --> 01:39:03.415
Good luck, brother.

01:39:19.127 --> 01:39:20.084
We are here.

01:39:29.572 --> 01:39:31.226
<i>Red 6, this is Red 1,</i>

01:39:31.226 --> 01:39:32.531
<i>got you Lima Charlie...</i>

01:39:32.531 --> 01:39:33.706
<i>Ron for Parker.</i>

01:39:33.706 --> 01:39:36.231
Boss, it's for you.
It's Ron Kay.

01:39:38.102 --> 01:39:39.538
<i>- Red 6, good copy.</i>
- Ron.

01:39:39.974 --> 01:39:41.323
<i>Result?</i>

01:39:41.323 --> 01:39:42.411
Parker, I found him.

01:39:43.499 --> 01:39:44.979
Tracking your location now.

01:39:45.675 --> 01:39:46.850
<i>You make contact?</i>

01:39:47.198 --> 01:39:48.678
No.

01:39:48.678 --> 01:39:50.854
But I am looking at him
right now.

01:39:50.854 --> 01:39:52.899
Uh, got his location now, sir.

01:39:53.726 --> 01:39:55.032
All right, we got you.

01:39:55.772 --> 01:39:57.252
Yeah, just wait a second.

01:40:00.472 --> 01:40:04.650
<i>Nearest extraction point
is Darunta Dam,</i>

01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:08.002
<i>two kilometers due east
from where you stand now.</i>

01:40:08.002 --> 01:40:10.743
- Darunta Dam. Got it.
<i>- All right, call us back</i>

01:40:10.743 --> 01:40:13.572
when you got your man,
his family,
and you're en route.

01:40:13.572 --> 01:40:15.879
You'll have a two-hour window
from that point, all right?

01:40:15.879 --> 01:40:19.143
Uh, yeah, one more thing,
Parker, um...

01:40:19.143 --> 01:40:22.059
We don't have much time.
I left a messy trail.

01:40:22.059 --> 01:40:23.495
All right, we'll make a call.

01:40:23.495 --> 01:40:24.888
See if we can get some eyes up.

01:40:25.584 --> 01:40:26.672
<i>Go get your boy.</i>

01:40:55.353 --> 01:40:56.659
A lot of dogs around here.

01:41:29.561 --> 01:41:30.475
I like your outfit.

01:41:31.998 --> 01:41:33.391
And I like what you've done
with your hair.

01:41:55.457 --> 01:41:58.329
Must've been quite challenging
to find me.

01:42:00.331 --> 01:42:01.289
Eh.

01:42:06.468 --> 01:42:10.036
I can get you
and your family outta here.

01:42:11.081 --> 01:42:12.691
We just have to leave now.

01:42:13.388 --> 01:42:14.215
Now?

01:42:20.786 --> 01:42:22.571
That's a shame.

01:42:26.618 --> 01:42:27.663
I like it here.

01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:34.626
Mmm.

01:42:36.802 --> 01:42:38.761
Mmm. I can see why. Yes.

01:42:50.555 --> 01:42:52.296
Fakhrudin.

01:42:52.296 --> 01:42:53.471
What is it?

01:42:53.471 --> 01:42:55.038
I found them.

01:42:55.038 --> 01:42:56.605
The American and Ahmed.

01:42:56.605 --> 01:42:58.868
Are you sure it's them?

01:42:58.868 --> 01:43:00.522
I'm positive.

01:43:00.522 --> 01:43:01.914
He's found John Kinley
and Ahmed.

01:43:01.914 --> 01:43:03.394
Get men out there now.

01:43:03.394 --> 01:43:06.180
Follow them right now
and get their picture.

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:07.181
Yeah, what is it, Joe?

01:43:07.572 --> 01:43:08.704
Ron Kay.

01:43:08.704 --> 01:43:09.879
What about him?

01:43:09.879 --> 01:43:10.923
Yeah, I thought
he looked familiar,

01:43:10.923 --> 01:43:12.577
but I couldn't
put my finger on it.

01:43:12.577 --> 01:43:15.363
So, I ran him through
the system and our intel shows

01:43:15.363 --> 01:43:17.843
he's on the Talib's
most-wanted list.

01:43:18.453 --> 01:43:19.454
He's on a list?

01:43:20.846 --> 01:43:22.196
<i>Why is he on a list?</i>

01:43:24.589 --> 01:43:26.852
Oh, fuck me.

01:43:26.852 --> 01:43:29.855
"Ron Kay", that...
that's John Kinley.

01:43:29.855 --> 01:43:31.509
Why didn't he
tell us that before?

01:43:31.509 --> 01:43:33.903
It's John Kinley
and Ahmed.

01:43:33.903 --> 01:43:36.210
<i>I think if John Kinley
is popular with the Talib,</i>

01:43:37.559 --> 01:43:39.648
then Ahmed is the fattest
fuckin' pig in the pen.

01:43:40.692 --> 01:43:42.564
Let's turn this thing around.

01:43:42.564 --> 01:43:45.784
- Cody, get Bagram
on the line, now!
-  Yes, sir.

01:43:45.784 --> 01:43:48.744
They're gonna want in on this,
and we wanna get
an <i>Angel</i> in the air.

01:43:48.744 --> 01:43:51.225
- You two, get the drone footage
up right now.
-  On it!

01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:52.791
At last,

01:43:53.836 --> 01:43:55.272
gonna get my boots dirty.

01:43:59.102 --> 01:44:00.234
Basira.

01:44:03.585 --> 01:44:04.847
Basira, this is John.

01:44:05.543 --> 01:44:06.544
John?

01:44:15.466 --> 01:44:17.903
Ahmed, what's going on?

01:44:17.903 --> 01:44:19.601
John has got us visas.

01:44:20.341 --> 01:44:21.733
We are going to America.

01:44:27.086 --> 01:44:28.131
We have to go now.

01:44:42.232 --> 01:44:43.581
Where are they?

01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:46.236
I have someone watching them.

01:44:46.236 --> 01:44:47.324
I'll take you there.

01:45:17.136 --> 01:45:17.963
Let's go.

01:45:34.066 --> 01:45:37.287
They are in the truck
heading towards the dam.

01:45:43.206 --> 01:45:45.948
They are heading
towards the dam.

01:45:45.948 --> 01:45:47.950
Fakhrudin, listen to me
very carefully.

01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:49.952
Do not let them get away,

01:45:49.952 --> 01:45:52.041
I want their heads
or else I'll take yours.

01:46:13.367 --> 01:46:14.455
I can see the dam.

01:46:22.158 --> 01:46:23.202
Taliban trucks!

01:46:23.899 --> 01:46:25.030
Taliban trucks!

01:46:45.877 --> 01:46:46.922
Pooya, block the tunnel.

01:47:33.708 --> 01:47:35.187
-  Move!

01:47:42.673 --> 01:47:44.022
Come on!

01:47:44.022 --> 01:47:45.807
Move, move, move,
move, move!

01:47:57.383 --> 01:47:58.472
Move, move, move!

01:48:01.866 --> 01:48:03.302
Cover, cover, cover!

01:48:03.302 --> 01:48:05.130
Go, go!
To the building,
to the building!

01:48:05.130 --> 01:48:06.131
Ahmed!

01:48:07.045 --> 01:48:08.133
Covering!

01:48:22.234 --> 01:48:23.322
Crap!

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.499
Motherfuckers!

01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:26.674
- Cover me.
-  Get down.

01:48:31.026 --> 01:48:32.157
Fuck!

01:48:32.549 --> 01:48:33.594
Shit!

01:48:37.032 --> 01:48:38.076
-  Go, go, go!

01:48:38.076 --> 01:48:39.208
Down!

01:48:52.351 --> 01:48:53.439
Fuck!

01:49:01.752 --> 01:49:03.711
-  Get down!
- Argh! I'm almost out.

01:49:10.848 --> 01:49:12.546
Ah, shit! I'm out!

01:49:21.163 --> 01:49:22.251
Come on, Parker!

01:49:30.607 --> 01:49:32.217
Where the fuck are you, Parker?

01:49:39.485 --> 01:49:41.836
- Shit. Shit.

01:49:43.359 --> 01:49:44.447
I'm out.

01:51:17.758 --> 01:51:19.194
<i>Identifying multiple targets,</i>

01:51:19.194 --> 01:51:21.675
<i>west end of the dam.</i>

01:51:21.675 --> 01:51:23.111
<i>Go in hot on the 105.</i>

01:51:27.071 --> 01:51:29.857
<i>I have visual, 0-6-0.</i>

01:51:31.554 --> 01:51:32.860
<i>They are clear.</i>

01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:34.339
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:51:46.612 --> 01:51:47.918
<i>All tangos down?</i>

01:51:47.918 --> 01:51:49.746
<i>Confirmed. Off the trigger.</i>

01:51:49.746 --> 01:51:52.575
<i>FOB 2, this is Spectre 3-7,
we are all clear.</i>

01:52:32.441 --> 01:52:33.529
Everyone all right?

01:52:36.010 --> 01:52:37.881
Bradley, Mike,
get him up and in the air.

01:52:37.881 --> 01:52:39.274
-  Yes, sir.

01:52:40.318 --> 01:52:42.320
You know,

01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:44.279
if you'd have told me
that you were John Kinley,

01:52:44.279 --> 01:52:45.846
and he's the Ahmed,

01:52:47.543 --> 01:52:49.545
you'd have got this
whole thing on me, pal.

01:52:57.422 --> 01:52:58.380
These are from Vokes.

01:52:59.947 --> 01:53:02.601
Visas for Ahmed,
his wife, the kid.

01:53:04.908 --> 01:53:06.649
All right, this is gonna
take you back to base.

01:53:06.649 --> 01:53:08.607
There's a transport airplane
waiting back there.

01:53:08.607 --> 01:53:09.739
It's gonna take you home.

01:53:10.827 --> 01:53:12.089
Parker.

01:53:12.089 --> 01:53:13.438
Kinley.

01:53:13.438 --> 01:53:14.831

01:53:15.701 --> 01:53:16.790
You backed yourself.

01:53:18.269 --> 01:53:21.142
