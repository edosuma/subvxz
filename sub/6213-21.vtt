WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.670
Well, I'm off
to the library

00:03.670 --> 00:05.472
to research
Renaissance poets.

00:05.472 --> 00:07.374
But feareth not,
my trusted friend.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.843
I shall returneth
before thou knoweth.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.012
Wait, hey, Sabrina,
on your way to the library

00:12.012 --> 00:14.014
could I bummeth a rideth?

00:14.014 --> 00:14.915
Sure. You know, Miles

00:14.915 --> 00:16.550
not that I mind
taking you to the library

00:16.550 --> 00:18.552
or your therapist
five times a week

00:18.552 --> 00:20.988
but have you ever considered
getting a license?

00:20.988 --> 00:22.222
Considered it, yes.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.458
Been foolish enough to act
upon it, no.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.193
Years ago, I was in
a traumatic accident

00:26.193 --> 00:28.462
and I'm still healing
from the emotional scars.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.496
Oh, that's awful.

00:29.496 --> 00:30.430
Were you physically hurt?

00:30.430 --> 00:32.466
I mean, no need
to get overly detailed.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.801
Amazingly, I walked away
without a scratch.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.937
My Big Wheel, however...

00:36.937 --> 00:37.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.206
You don't drive
because of an accident

00:39.206 --> 00:41.008
you had with a toy
when you were five?

00:41.008 --> 00:42.776
Twelve.
And it's not just me.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.978
All the Goodmans have
terrible luck
behind the wheel.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.180
My Uncle Buddy was
the only Good Humor man

00:47.180 --> 00:49.049
whose bell drove kids
into their houses

00:49.049 --> 00:50.584
instead of out of them.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.818
That was your uncle?

00:51.818 --> 00:54.054
I had nightmares
about that guy!

00:54.054 --> 00:55.055
Get in the car.

00:59.192 --> 01:05.799

and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:05.799 --> 01:11.872

01:35.762 --> 01:37.297
Hi, Miles!

01:37.297 --> 01:38.999
I've decided I can't
just stand by

01:38.999 --> 01:39.833
and watch you ruin
your life

01:39.833 --> 01:41.468
by letting your fears
control you.

01:41.468 --> 01:44.938
So, I stopped by on the way home
and got you a little present.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.707
A driver's manual?

01:46.707 --> 01:49.042
Thanks. I've always believed
that a passenger

01:49.042 --> 01:51.778
is equally responsible for
knowing the rules of the road.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.381
Except your days of being
a passenger are over.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.450
In there is everything
you need to get your
learner's permit.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.352
So start studying.
You're taking the
written test tomorrow.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.720
What?
That's madness!

01:59.720 --> 02:01.121
You can't force
a person to drive

02:01.121 --> 02:02.389
especially a Goodman.

02:02.389 --> 02:03.590
Yadda, yadda, I know.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.292
No one in your
family can drive.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.794
Your father can't even
steer luggage with wheels.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.730
You know, Miles, the
longer you make excuses

02:09.730 --> 02:12.165
the longer you'll be
paralyzed by your fear.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.433
First, you're
afraid to drive.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.635
Next, you're scared
to leave the house.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.569
But that was a
one-week phase

02:15.569 --> 02:17.738
and I worked through it.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.039
Go and study, and
don't come back

02:19.039 --> 02:21.108
until you can tell me what
a red flashing light means.

02:21.108 --> 02:25.545
That's easy.
"My ambulance is here."

02:25.545 --> 02:28.615
Hilda, I've had it.
I am no longer wasting my life

02:28.615 --> 02:30.684
waiting for men
to show up at my door.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.686
What are you going to do?
Chase them down the street?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.621
Wear ankle support.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.390
I'm talking about
the exterminator.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.625
I rearranged my entire
schedule for those idiots

02:38.625 --> 02:40.427
and they never even showed.

02:40.427 --> 02:43.730
It's so hard to find
good help these days.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.066
( <i>clears throat</i> )

02:46.066 --> 02:48.301
Hilda, I'm telling you,
you have got to pitch in

02:48.301 --> 02:50.370
and help me deal with
these service people.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.339
Hello?
Business to run.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.307
And how dare you accuse
me of not helping.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.842
Who spent
Saturday afternoon

02:55.842 --> 02:57.778
waiting for the plumber
to show up?

02:57.778 --> 02:59.312
I did.

02:59.312 --> 03:00.280
Ladies?

03:00.280 --> 03:03.083
I think <i>I</i> have the solution
to your problem.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.819
Get a personal assistant
to do it all <i>for</i> you.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.287
Not a bad idea.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.289
Where would <i>we</i> find
a personal assistant?

03:09.289 --> 03:11.458
Right in front of you!

03:11.458 --> 03:14.294
Morgan, we really
appreciate the offer

03:14.294 --> 03:16.063
but I think I speak
for both Hilda and I

03:16.063 --> 03:16.730
when I say...

03:16.730 --> 03:18.432
No freaking way!

03:18.432 --> 03:19.232
It took me two months

03:19.232 --> 03:20.567
to get you to scrub
a coffeepot

03:20.567 --> 03:21.802
and I still have
to use a cattle prod

03:21.802 --> 03:23.303
to get you to wait
on a table.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.738
That's different.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.974
There's no challenge
in taking a stupid coffee order.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.077
But running people's lives?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.145
It's what I do!

03:32.145 --> 03:37.050
If I had your exterminator's
phone number, I could show you.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.452
This is Morgan Cavanaugh

03:38.452 --> 03:42.155
personal assistant
to the Spellman sisters.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.859
Oh, you didn't show up
because your truck broke down?

03:45.859 --> 03:46.993
Good one.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.562
I'll pass that along
to my boyfriend

03:48.562 --> 03:52.232
the consumer affairs reporter
for Channel Three.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.333
Well, if that's

03:53.333 --> 03:55.669
the best you can do...

03:55.669 --> 03:58.138
Bye-bye.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.506
They'll be there
in 10 minutes

03:59.506 --> 04:01.675
and they're bringing bagels.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.376
Here's a key.

04:03.376 --> 04:07.247
Avoid the cat.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.416
I did it.
I passed my written test

04:09.416 --> 04:11.051
and I got my official
learner's permit.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.319
Great! Now I don't
have to schlep you

04:12.319 --> 04:14.321
to your allergist
every Wednesday.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.522
So, where's Sabrina?

04:15.522 --> 04:17.023
I want her to take me
for a driving lesson.

04:17.023 --> 04:17.858
She went to class.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.126
She'll be back
in a couple of hours.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.595
Oh? Well, hey,
you wouldn't

04:21.595 --> 04:22.629
by any chance
be willing to...?

04:22.629 --> 04:23.964
No.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.065
Well, that's too bad.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.067
'Cause you're from New York,
and everyone knows

04:27.067 --> 04:29.569
New Yorkers are
the best drivers.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.971
Wow, you're a kiss-up.

04:30.971 --> 04:34.841
Go on.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.409
Please, I'm begging you.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.311
Help me lose
these shackles
and win my freedom.

04:38.311 --> 04:40.147
All right,
I'll teach you to drive.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.082
Nothing's worse
than watching you grovel.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.520
Mmm, something
smells good.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.488
And the house
is spotless.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.257
Is this our house?

04:50.257 --> 04:51.625
Welcome home, ladies.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.293
Mail's been sorted,
dinner's ordered

04:53.293 --> 04:55.762
and dry cleaning
is hanging in
your closets.

04:55.762 --> 04:57.063
But how did you know
which clothes were mine

04:57.063 --> 04:58.598
and which ones
were Zelda's?

04:58.598 --> 05:02.068
Mine weren't designed
by Barnum and Bailey.

05:02.068 --> 05:04.271
Stuffed mushroom?
Mini quiche?

05:04.271 --> 05:05.672
You made all these?

05:05.672 --> 05:06.640
Pretty much.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.608
I opened the door
for the caterer.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.610
<i>Ciao.</i>

05:10.610 --> 05:13.446
Well, I must say, I am
really pretty impressed.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.514
Me, too.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.517
Who knew quiches
came in mini?

05:17.517 --> 05:18.451
Hey, Roxie.
Where have you been?

05:18.451 --> 05:19.853
Taking Miles
for a driving lesson.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.021
He got his permit.

05:21.021 --> 05:25.826
That's great!
So, how did
the lesson go?

05:25.826 --> 05:29.696
I saw my entire life
flash before my eyes.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.665
Miles, you're never
going to be a good driver

05:31.665 --> 05:33.667
unless you learn
to drive aggressively.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.035
By yelling phrases like

05:35.035 --> 05:37.037
"Slow down,
and you'll be mowed down"

05:37.037 --> 05:39.339
or "Out of my lane,
or you'll feel the pain."

05:39.339 --> 05:41.408
Maybe Roxie's driving style
just isn't for you.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.076
Maybe <i>driving</i>
isn't for me.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.512
Sure it is, but maybe
you just need a less
hostile teacher.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.780
Who are you calling
hostile?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.415
Sorry.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.350
I meant psychotic.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.219
Look, after a few
lessons from me

05:52.219 --> 05:54.087
you'll have your license
in no time.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.089
Okay, just promise me
that if a crossing guard

05:56.089 --> 05:58.725
asks us to stop,
you won't flip
her the bird.

05:58.725 --> 05:59.793
Who would do
such a thing?

05:59.793 --> 06:03.530
Hey! School was out.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.065
Hey, this isn't so bad.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.266
I'm doing much better with you.

06:06.266 --> 06:11.104
Great. Now, let's try
turning on the ignition.

06:11.104 --> 06:12.873
Shouldn't we save that
for the next lesson?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.841
I'm still digesting
the fog lights

06:14.841 --> 06:16.243
and automatic locks.

06:16.243 --> 06:18.612
Well, finish digesting,
and then give it some gas.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.719
Okay, you're doing great.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.920
Now, we're going
to turn right

06:26.920 --> 06:31.358
so, uh, flip on
your signal.

long enough.

this, my head will explode.

on the road.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.027
I fell off a pony
when I was six.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.230
I haven't been on
a merry-go-round since.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.632
I'm glad I didn't know you
as a child.

08:52.632 --> 08:54.567
I can't wait to sink
my tush into the couch

08:54.567 --> 08:55.702
and enjoy the
little surprises

08:55.702 --> 08:59.806
Morgan has in store
for us tonight.

08:59.806 --> 09:03.810
Not exactly
the surprise
I had in mind.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.378
Morgan?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.846
Where's our furniture?

09:06.846 --> 09:08.648
Well, I was going to send it
straight to Goodwill

09:08.648 --> 09:10.884
but then I realized that
those hideous patterns

09:10.884 --> 09:13.686
are nothing a little
reupholstering won't cure.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.255
You sent our furniture
to be re-covered

09:15.255 --> 09:16.823
without even asking us?

09:16.823 --> 09:19.025
Why should great minds
be bogged down

09:19.025 --> 09:22.662
with little decisions?

09:22.662 --> 09:23.863
Well, I would hardly call

09:23.863 --> 09:26.299
emptying our living room
a little decision.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.767
In the future,
we would like you

09:27.767 --> 09:29.202
to notify us
before undertaking

09:29.202 --> 09:31.571
such an endeavor,
right, Hilda?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.173
I'm sorry. I was still
going over the part

09:33.173 --> 09:34.908
about our great minds.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.177
Note taken and filed.

09:37.177 --> 09:41.114
Now, how about
a nice, chilled
glass of champagne?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.450
Did you hear that,
Zellie? Champagne.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.885
Well, I do have
papers to grade,
but I guess

09:45.885 --> 09:48.021
one little glass
of bubbly wouldn't hurt.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.257
Your wish is
my command.

09:51.257 --> 09:55.261
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

09:55.261 --> 09:56.796
Is there a Sabrina
Spellman here?

09:56.796 --> 09:57.764
Is there ever.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.200
Sabrina Spellman,
at your service.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.001
Actually, you're the
one being served.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.036
Hey.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.038
Where are you going
with my tulips?

10:05.038 --> 10:08.241
What does he mean,
"being served?"

10:08.241 --> 10:09.943
"Notice to defendant
Sabrina Spellman.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.211
"You are being sued
by plaintiff

10:11.211 --> 10:12.812
Mary Jo Ponder..."

10:12.812 --> 10:13.613
"...for causing her

10:13.613 --> 10:15.982
extensive bodily injury!"

10:15.982 --> 10:17.016
This doesn't make any sense!

10:17.016 --> 10:19.052
When we left Mary Jo,
she said everything was fine.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.187
Well, Sabrina, as someone who's
familiar with physical ailments

10:21.187 --> 10:24.424
I can tell you it often takes
24 hours for pain to set in.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.493
I don't believe this.
She seemed so nice.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.361
She served you with a summons.

10:28.361 --> 10:31.030
This is all my fault.
It's the Goodman family curse.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.298
We're just not meant to be
behind the wheel.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.766
Will you stop making
this about you?

10:33.766 --> 10:35.869
Sabrina's the one
being sued!

10:35.869 --> 10:38.138
For $2 million,
if anybody's interested.

10:43.843 --> 10:46.246
There... it's not exactly
<i>Martha Stewart's Living</i>

10:46.246 --> 10:48.014
but at least we have
someplace to sit.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.884
Oh! I call the
bean bag chair.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.452
Sorry about
the inconvenience

10:52.452 --> 10:53.386
but they Fed-Exed me

10:53.386 --> 10:55.121
a swatch of the couch
fabric this morning

10:55.121 --> 10:57.290
and it was <i>completely</i>
unacceptable.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.791
I'm having them redo
the whole thing.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.827
Morgan, I'm not sure
how long we can live this way.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.995
Not to worry.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.097
I told them if that
furniture wasn't
finished by Monday

11:04.097 --> 11:06.699
they'd regret the day
they learned to sew.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.536
Believe you me, those nuns
in France are stitching faster

11:09.536 --> 11:11.504
than they can say "Hail Mary."

11:11.504 --> 11:12.972
I can't think
about this now.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.174
Tomorrow is
Wayne's birthday

11:14.174 --> 11:15.441
and I have to
buy him a gift.

11:15.441 --> 11:16.743
Already taken care of.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.244
Delivered it myself
this morning.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.246
And I think you will be
<i>very</i> impressed

11:20.246 --> 11:23.516
with how closely I matched
your signature on the card.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.451
You bought my boyfriend's
birthday gift

11:25.451 --> 11:27.086
and forged my signature?

11:27.086 --> 11:28.588
No need to thank me.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.223
It's what you pay me for.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.126
Oh, and I added a little
personal note, as well.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.662
Morgan, you have
<i>really</i> crossed the line.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.396
You think?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.697
( <i>phone rings</i> )

11:40.567 --> 11:41.734
Hello?

11:41.734 --> 11:43.469
Oh, hi, Wayne.

11:43.469 --> 11:44.537
You loved the gift

11:44.537 --> 11:47.574
and you can't wait
to try it out on me?

11:47.574 --> 11:49.442
I'm sure it <i>will</i> be fun...

11:49.442 --> 11:51.611
I guess.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.012
Bye-bye.

11:53.012 --> 11:54.714
Told you he'd love it.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.217
Morgan, just out
of curiosity

11:57.217 --> 11:59.552
what did you get
President Banning?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.354
I don't want to
spoil the surprise.

12:01.354 --> 12:04.057
Oh, but be sure to bring
a top hat and a whisk.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.329
I've really done it
this time, Salem.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.897
I ruined Mary Jo's life!

12:10.897 --> 12:12.332
I mean, I crippled a woman!

12:12.332 --> 12:14.200
Oh, <i>please!</i>

12:14.200 --> 12:16.069
This is the oldest trick
in the book.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.670
The woman's a scam artist.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.805
A con.

12:18.805 --> 12:19.906
A sponge who
earns her living

12:19.906 --> 12:22.208
preying on the naiveté
of others.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.310
So is she single?

12:24.310 --> 12:27.280
Salem, Mary Jo has a doctor's
diagnosis confirming

12:27.280 --> 12:28.681
she has multiple injuries.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.116
And I've got a degree
from Harvard

12:30.116 --> 12:32.418
confirming I'm
a marine biologist!

12:32.418 --> 12:33.353
Fact is

12:33.353 --> 12:35.455
if we popped over
to Mary Jo's unannounced

12:35.455 --> 12:38.958
you'd find her doing
the hokeypokey.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.426
Ow! Uh.

12:40.426 --> 12:44.097
I get a shooting
pain down my arms
every time I blink.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.233
Not exactly the hokeypokey.

12:47.233 --> 12:51.304
Could you do me a favor
and get my pain pills please?

12:51.304 --> 12:54.440
There you go.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.609
See, Salem, you were all wrong
about Mary Jo.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.810
<i>Please!</i>

12:57.810 --> 12:59.779
Any amateur can throw a brace
around her neck

12:59.779 --> 13:01.047
and lie in a bed.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.982
But it takes a professional

13:02.982 --> 13:04.284
to get her up and moving.

13:04.284 --> 13:08.187
Watch and learn.

13:08.187 --> 13:09.322
Ow!

13:09.322 --> 13:10.590
<i>Ow!</i>

13:10.590 --> 13:12.258
Aah!

13:12.258 --> 13:13.493
Your cat clawed me!

13:13.493 --> 13:15.128
I could have bled to death.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.030
I'm adding that to my lawsuit!

13:17.030 --> 13:18.264
Glad you're feeling better.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.466
Got to go.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.935
See, I told you Mary Jo is
really hurt.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.337
And you also told me

13:24.337 --> 13:26.205
you barely tapped her vehicle.

13:26.205 --> 13:26.939
This thing looks

13:26.939 --> 13:28.975
like it was hit
by a Sherman tank.

13:28.975 --> 13:29.976
Well, it didn't look
like this

13:29.976 --> 13:32.178
the day
of the accident.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.746
If you don't believe me,
ask him.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.382
Sure, right after
I ask that weed whacker

13:36.382 --> 13:38.284
where I can find a good deli.

13:38.284 --> 13:39.085
I, on the other hand

13:39.085 --> 13:41.354
can have this car talking
in no time.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.856
( <i>chuckling softly</i> )

13:43.856 --> 13:46.025
Okay, so I can't
get the car to talk.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.760
But I <i>can</i> get some advice

13:47.760 --> 13:49.862
from some Other Realm
Car Talk experts.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.999
Click and Clack?
I love those guys.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.101
Much funnier
than Frick and Frack.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.202
WOMAN:
Anyway, my husband's
getting

13:56.202 --> 13:57.503
the Mercedes in the divorce

13:57.503 --> 13:59.405
and all I'm getting
is a ratty magic carpet

13:59.405 --> 14:01.074
with 500,000 miles.

14:01.074 --> 14:01.741
CLICK:
Sounds like what

14:01.741 --> 14:04.143
you should get
is a new lawyer!

14:04.143 --> 14:05.545
Let's take
another call.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.646
It's Sabrina Spellman.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.114
You're on the "Other
Realm Car Talk"

14:08.114 --> 14:10.416
with Click and Clack,
the Tappet brothers.
What's up, baby?

14:10.416 --> 14:12.418
I've got a car here
that I can't get to talk.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.686
Count your
blessings, girl.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.856
I got a brother
who won't shut up.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.690
Well, what kind
of a car

14:17.690 --> 14:18.991
are we talking
about here, Sabrina?

14:18.991 --> 14:20.493
A Sedan DeVille.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.528
You sound a little
young for a land yacht.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.365
I mean, what color's your
hair? It's not blue, is it?

14:25.365 --> 14:26.432
What year
is that DeVille?

14:26.432 --> 14:27.667
Because, you know,
they changed

14:27.667 --> 14:29.402
the incantation
on the '91s.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.037
Uh, it looks like a '91.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.271
Well, that could be
it. All right, look.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.106
Here's what you do.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.407
Tap on the hood
three times

14:34.407 --> 14:36.476
and you say this--
"Cars are great

14:36.476 --> 14:37.643
"cause you don't
have to walk.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.412
But they're even better
when they talk."

14:39.412 --> 14:40.079
You got that?

14:40.079 --> 14:40.713
Got it.

14:40.713 --> 14:41.481
And when you've done that,

14:41.481 --> 14:42.515
walk around the car

14:42.515 --> 14:44.584
and sniff the right
front wheel.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.152
Sniff the wheel?
What's that for?

14:46.152 --> 14:47.787
That's, uh,
for our amusement.

14:47.787 --> 14:48.654
( <i>laughter</i> )

14:48.654 --> 14:49.555
( <i>turns radio off</i> )

14:53.292 --> 14:55.228
( <i>knocking</i> )

14:55.228 --> 14:56.629
"Cars are great,
cause you don't have to walk

14:56.629 --> 14:59.198
but they're even better
when they talk."

14:59.198 --> 15:00.933
Hey, blondie,
nice gams.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.101
Gams?

15:02.101 --> 15:04.670
I thought you were a '91,
not a '46.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.038
So, what's the deal?

15:06.038 --> 15:07.640
After the accident,
all you had was a scratch.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.208
Now your whole
rear end's a mess!

15:09.208 --> 15:10.276
I can't say.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.778
Sure you can.
What are you afraid of?

15:11.778 --> 15:12.945
Have you <i>seen</i> Mary Jo?

15:12.945 --> 15:14.881
The woman could crush me
with her bare hands!

15:14.881 --> 15:16.149
Is that what she did
to your trunk?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.617
My grill is sealed.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.851
You know,
for a full-sized sedan

15:18.851 --> 15:20.620
you've got the spine
of a golf cart!

15:20.620 --> 15:22.522
Do you think I like
living like this?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.223
I was hoping to be
a classic someday

15:24.223 --> 15:25.825
but that broad's
got me in an accident

15:25.825 --> 15:27.360
every week!

15:27.360 --> 15:28.461
She does?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.229
She sees some
fictitious animal,

15:30.229 --> 15:31.297
slams on my brakes,

15:31.297 --> 15:32.365
and then if I'm not
wrecked enough

15:32.365 --> 15:34.767
she backs me
into a brick wall.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.068
Oh, so she did this
on purpose

15:36.068 --> 15:37.703
to collect
the insurance money.

15:37.703 --> 15:38.938
SALEM:
Hmm...

15:38.938 --> 15:41.741
and where've we heard
<i>that</i> theory before?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.810
Well, she's not going to be
pulling this scam anymore!

15:43.810 --> 15:44.911
I'll just have you
explain the truth

15:44.911 --> 15:46.479
to the lawyers
and the insurance company!

15:46.479 --> 15:48.114
Great idea!

15:48.114 --> 15:50.082
And I, the talking cat

15:50.082 --> 15:52.351
will be exhibit "B."

15:52.351 --> 15:53.619
So much for proof.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.422
Wow, the cat
talks-- <i>freaky.</i>

15:57.990 --> 15:59.225
Okay, ladies.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.760
Here are
your schedules,

16:00.760 --> 16:01.861
here are your
lunches,

16:01.861 --> 16:04.130
and here are your
3:00 PM snacks.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.131
How come I get
an apple

16:05.131 --> 16:07.533
and she gets that
big ol' hunk of cheese?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.502
Because Zelda
needs the protein

16:09.502 --> 16:10.736
and you need
the fiber.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.873
Boy, you really are on top
of things, aren't you?

16:13.873 --> 16:15.341
I had no idea how
liberating it would be

16:15.341 --> 16:17.176
not to have to make
any personal decisions.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.110
Tell me about it.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.214
I don't know how
we ever managed without her.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.515
Oh, Zelda.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.183
How many times do
I have to tell you?

16:24.183 --> 16:25.485
Scarf goes
on the left.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.387
Oh, of course, of course.
My better side.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.489
And, remember--

16:29.489 --> 16:31.891
"Chin up,
shoulders high...

16:31.891 --> 16:35.962
( <i>all</i> ):
...keeps the gentlemen
coming by."

16:35.962 --> 16:37.196
And exactly who is this person

16:37.196 --> 16:39.298
who told you
Mary Jo was a faker?

16:39.298 --> 16:40.900
Let's just say
someone close to her

16:40.900 --> 16:42.702
was kind of
a motor mouth.

16:42.702 --> 16:43.803
Anyway, there's got
to be some way

16:43.803 --> 16:45.671
to prove Mary Jo is a fraud.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.706
I've got a cousin in Jersey

16:46.706 --> 16:48.274
that could get her
out of that brace.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.309
Or into
some concrete.

16:50.309 --> 16:51.711
But that wouldn't prove
Mary Jo's guilty.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.946
In my scenario,
that wouldn't really matter.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.582
( <i>phone rings</i> )

16:56.582 --> 16:57.783
Hello?

16:57.783 --> 16:59.652
Can I tell Sabrina
who's calling?

16:59.652 --> 17:01.020
Sedan who?

17:01.020 --> 17:01.387
Sedan

17:01.387 --> 17:02.154
DeVille?

17:02.154 --> 17:04.257
Very funny-- and I'm
I.P. Freely.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.591
That's disgusting.

17:05.591 --> 17:06.826
Hello, this is Sabrina.

17:06.826 --> 17:07.460
DeVILLE:
It's me.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.394
I just dropped
Mary Jo off

17:08.394 --> 17:09.795
at Silverman's gym
on Dickens.

17:09.795 --> 17:10.696
Could be an opportunity

17:10.696 --> 17:12.064
if you catch my drift.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.599
Gotcha.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.967
And why is this
an opportunity?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.168
Because if you see her

17:16.168 --> 17:18.538
and she slips up with her
little invalid routine...

17:18.538 --> 17:21.974
I can catch her
in the act. Good plan, Sedan.

17:21.974 --> 17:25.778
You know, you American cars
have really improved.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.948
Excuse me.
I need some help.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.182
Oh, sorry.

17:30.182 --> 17:30.950
Uh, I'm looking

17:30.950 --> 17:32.451
for someone
named Mary Jo Ponder.

17:32.451 --> 17:33.286
Do you know her?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.720
Oh, everybody knows
Mary Jo.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.088
She's, uh, held every
weightlifting record

17:36.088 --> 17:38.057
in this gym for
the last ten years.

17:38.057 --> 17:38.424
And then she had

17:38.424 --> 17:40.893
the accident.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.061
Just look at that poor thing

17:42.061 --> 17:43.062
suffering over
there.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.497
Ow!

17:44.497 --> 17:45.364
Well, I'll bet that
lawsuit money

17:45.364 --> 17:47.166
will help her
ease the pain.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.404
Well, if she has
that many records

17:51.404 --> 17:53.573
I'm guessing she's going
to want to hold on to them.

18:05.217 --> 18:06.786
Wow.
Who are you?

18:06.786 --> 18:10.056
I'm Olga Spellmanovich,
world-class weightlifter.

18:10.056 --> 18:10.723
Now shut up.

18:10.723 --> 18:11.557
You're sucking all
the oxygen

18:11.557 --> 18:14.727
out of the room.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.129
Mary Jo,
check it out.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.298
It looks like you've got
some serious competition.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.643
Give me a break.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.279
I could bench press
that with my toe.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.214
I mean, if I was feeling better.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.486
Unbelievable.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.788
I've never seen anyone
lift that much weight before.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.257
Olga's not anyone. I'm the best.

18:45.257 --> 18:48.127
Oh, please.
I could lift twice that much.

18:48.127 --> 18:52.365
Talk is cheap.
Besides, look at me.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.634
I'm in great shape.
And look at your arms.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.335
I've seen toothpicks
with more definition.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.871
( <i>men snickering</i> )

18:58.871 --> 19:00.906
You'd kill to be
in the shape that I'm in.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.376
Oh, please. You're just
a little girly-girl.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.547
I'll show you
who's a girly-girl.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.896
Wow, that's incredible.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.465
Who's in great shape now?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.366
I'd say...

19:27.366 --> 19:29.935
still me.

19:29.935 --> 19:30.836
Sabrina?

19:30.836 --> 19:31.904
I've been working out.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.372
But one thing that's
not going to work out

19:33.372 --> 19:34.106
is you suing me

19:34.106 --> 19:35.007
since a room full of people

19:35.007 --> 19:37.710
just saw you lift 400 pounds.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.178
500.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.913
Whatever, girly-girl.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.219
Hilda, Zelda.
Let's go.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.054
Time for our walk.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.889
( <i>blows whistle</i> )

19:49.889 --> 19:51.290
Sorry I'm late.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.491
It took longer
than anticipated

19:52.491 --> 19:53.859
to perform
the skin regimen

19:53.859 --> 19:55.961
you posted
on my bathroom mirror.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.229
It was so involved.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.898
But so worth it.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.500
I have to say,
I'm very pleased.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.836
You and Hilda
have come so far.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.105
Exactly where
are we going?

20:06.105 --> 20:07.473
Cute outfit.

20:07.473 --> 20:10.843
Oh... my... God.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.012
Morgan, you are
turning us into you.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.281
Oh, that's still
going to take some time.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.382
But we're
getting there.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.983
Now, who's going to lead us

20:17.983 --> 20:19.385
on our little
hike today?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.721
The only one taking
a hike today is you.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.888
You're fired.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.993
I'm not sure what
just went on here

20:27.993 --> 20:31.230
but I'm definitely
keeping the hat.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.799
So the entire
lawsuit's been dropped?

20:33.799 --> 20:34.533
That's right.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.968
Mary Jo's been
charged with fraud

20:35.968 --> 20:37.336
and you no longer
have to feel guilty

20:37.336 --> 20:39.004
about ruining
a woman's life.

Or, as my friend Olga
would say

( <i>German accent</i> ):
"That weight can now

20:41.807 --> 20:44.009
be lifted off
your shoulders."

What a relief.
I can now tool
around guilt-free.

Which reminds me,

too much
of an inconvenience...
