WEBVTT

00:00.255 --> 00:01.555
And do you, Emma,

00:01.655 --> 00:05.396
take this man to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

00:05.496 --> 00:09.116
to have and to hold, as
long as you both shall live?

00:09.216 --> 00:11.817
(solemn music)

00:19.338 --> 00:21.439
I do.

00:21.539 --> 00:24.139
(upbeat music)

00:51.545 --> 00:54.145
(Ben knocking)

00:55.145 --> 00:57.126
(door latch clicks)

00:57.226 --> 00:59.366
We brought the box back.

00:59.466 --> 01:01.807
Oh, thank you very much. (chuckles)

01:01.907 --> 01:03.907
Come on in.

01:15.269 --> 01:18.270
(children giggling)

01:20.550 --> 01:21.611
How was the journey?

01:21.711 --> 01:23.711
Good.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.452
Look at this.

01:26.552 --> 01:28.132
What is it?

01:28.232 --> 01:30.932
It's a card to daddy from mummy.

01:31.032 --> 01:32.893
Can I read it?

01:32.993 --> 01:35.333
Hello, sweethearts.

01:35.433 --> 01:38.094
Yeah. Yeah, go on Poppy.

01:38.194 --> 01:39.094
Dear Ben.

01:39.194 --> 01:41.194
That's you.

01:41.995 --> 01:43.995
- Dear Ben.
- Dear Ben.

01:45.635 --> 01:47.636
I love you.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.176
I love the life we have,

01:50.276 --> 01:54.417
and the one we are about
to have with these babies.

01:54.517 --> 01:58.018
I can still remember the first
thing I ever said to you.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.738
It was an accident.

01:59.838 --> 02:02.219
(both chuckling)

02:02.319 --> 02:05.019
And everything that's
happened since meeting you,

02:05.119 --> 02:07.420
falling in love with you,
and having these babies

02:07.520 --> 02:11.900
with you, has all been one
big beautiful accident.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.761
(poignant music)

02:15.721 --> 02:16.481
- I've never felt like this
- I've never felt like this

02:16.481 --> 02:18.382
- about someone before.
- about someone before.

02:18.482 --> 02:22.322
No one has ever made me
feel like this before.

02:24.443 --> 02:26.423
- I love you.
- I love you.

02:26.523 --> 02:27.223
- And I think
- And I think

02:27.323 --> 02:28.084
- I'm gonna love you
- I'm gonna love you

02:28.084 --> 02:30.664
- for the rest of my life.
- For the rest of my life.

02:30.764 --> 02:33.525
(poignant music)

02:40.726 --> 02:43.387
Do you love us like that, Daddy?

02:43.487 --> 02:46.487
Comes and goes, to be honest, Pop.

02:47.607 --> 02:49.608
Drink?

02:55.489 --> 02:56.469
Come on, kids.

02:56.569 --> 02:58.810
Let's have a game of footy.

03:01.570 --> 03:02.510
Kick it.

03:02.610 --> 03:03.511
Pass it to me.

03:03.611 --> 03:05.031
Oh, oh, I almost had it.

03:05.131 --> 03:07.131
Almost had it.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.632
Pass it to me.

03:08.732 --> 03:09.472
All right.

03:09.572 --> 03:13.092
(Poppy and kids laughing)

03:20.494 --> 03:22.994
Jack and Poppy asked me
if heaven exists recently.

03:23.094 --> 03:25.575
Hmm. What did you tell them?

03:27.855 --> 03:31.536
Different people
believe different things.

03:33.856 --> 03:35.357
Now whatever you teach these children

03:35.457 --> 03:36.717
about heaven is up to you,

03:36.817 --> 03:39.198
but if I were to ask you
to teach them one thing,

03:39.298 --> 03:41.298
it would be this.

03:43.418 --> 03:47.579
If you believe in something
or someone, go for it.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.000
Otherwise, you'll never know the joy

03:53.100 --> 03:55.361
it could have brought you.

03:55.461 --> 03:58.161
I mean, look at you and Jess. Hmm?

03:58.261 --> 04:00.322
You fell in love, and you
believed it would work out.

04:00.422 --> 04:02.422
You had faith.

04:03.302 --> 04:05.483
Faith is just that.

04:05.583 --> 04:08.423
Faith, it's something you believe,

04:09.463 --> 04:12.084
not something you know.

04:12.184 --> 04:14.764
It's not an ironclad shield against pain.

04:14.864 --> 04:18.365
It's, it's a crystallisation of hope.

04:18.465 --> 04:19.885
And look at what faith gave you.

04:19.985 --> 04:21.766
- Grandpa, come!
- Grandpa, come!

04:21.866 --> 04:24.786
(Charlie chuckles)

04:31.148 --> 04:31.848
Come on then.

04:31.948 --> 04:33.288
Who's in goal?

04:33.388 --> 04:36.129
(Charlie and kids laughing)

04:36.229 --> 04:38.849
What did you two talk about?

04:38.949 --> 04:40.950
Faith.

04:45.671 --> 04:48.271
I still have faith, you know.

04:49.431 --> 04:51.432
In him.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.792
In them.

04:55.072 --> 04:57.813
And I'm aware at times
it doesn't seem like it.

04:57.913 --> 04:59.913
But, in you.

05:03.074 --> 05:06.915
(Charlie and kids chattering)

05:16.917 --> 05:19.697
Do you remember at the funeral,

05:19.797 --> 05:22.798
when I said I can do this on my own?

05:27.159 --> 05:30.759
(gentle music)
I was wrong.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.520
I need you.

05:38.201 --> 05:40.201
They need you,

05:41.962 --> 05:44.202
to know how to be like her.

05:50.123 --> 05:52.124
Thank you.

05:53.324 --> 05:55.324
Come here.

06:06.926 --> 06:11.767
All right, your turn in goal. (chuckles)

06:28.571 --> 06:31.031
I met her, you know?

06:31.131 --> 06:33.192
In the park.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.992
I liked her.

06:35.092 --> 06:37.672
I mean, she seemed genuinely
happy to see the kids.

06:37.772 --> 06:41.393
So there must be something
wrong with her. (chuckles)

06:41.493 --> 06:43.494
Yeah, I liked her.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.575
When Jess died,

06:50.295 --> 06:52.835
do you know what I never
thought I'd feel again?

06:52.935 --> 06:54.636
Love?

06:54.736 --> 06:56.736
Joy.

06:57.096 --> 07:00.857
Bu time passes, and you
get surprised by joy,

07:05.018 --> 07:06.678
because when I met Emma, I was.

07:06.778 --> 07:08.599
Surprised?

07:08.699 --> 07:10.199
Scared.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.519
Of?

07:11.619 --> 07:13.600
I dunno.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.800
Loving someone again.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.480
Losing someone again.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.001
How it would affect the kids.

07:19.101 --> 07:21.801
Oh, what you had with
Jess was wonderful.

07:21.901 --> 07:23.601
So to even start a relationship with Emma,

07:23.701 --> 07:25.942
she must have been special.

07:27.502 --> 07:29.363
You do realise how lucky you are

07:29.463 --> 07:31.643
to have found someone you
love who loves you back twice.

07:31.743 --> 07:32.523
Come on.

07:32.623 --> 07:34.404
Because I have lived
54 years on this earth,

07:34.504 --> 07:36.764
and I haven't found it once.

07:36.864 --> 07:39.745
She's getting married to someone.

07:40.745 --> 07:43.465
Have you told her how you feel?

07:48.066 --> 07:50.667
Better get a move on then, huh?

07:52.307 --> 07:55.208
No, it's not the right time.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.308
No. Right.

07:57.868 --> 08:01.049
Well, when you do find the perfect person

08:01.149 --> 08:02.409
at the perfect time in your life

08:02.509 --> 08:03.769
and the perfect time in theirs,

08:03.869 --> 08:05.570
and they happen to think
that you are perfect too,

08:05.670 --> 08:06.570
let me know, will you?

08:06.670 --> 08:08.210
Because you know what I'll be?

08:08.310 --> 08:09.050
What?

08:09.150 --> 08:11.151
Surprised.

08:12.511 --> 08:15.512
There's no medals for martyrs, love.

08:17.672 --> 08:21.213
(children laughing)

08:21.313 --> 08:22.333
Come on you two.

08:22.433 --> 08:26.194
Let's give your dad a
bit of peace and quiet.

08:27.194 --> 08:28.694
(door thuds)

08:28.794 --> 08:30.375
Oh crikey, right, Come
on, put this stuff away.

08:30.475 --> 08:32.495
Let's have a tidy up, and
then you can go have a bath.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.255
No, I don't want a tidy up.

08:34.355 --> 08:36.536
(gentle music)

08:36.636 --> 08:41.637
♪ I will never forget that evening ♪

08:42.117 --> 08:44.777
♪ When you brightened up my life ♪

08:44.877 --> 08:49.418
♪ And my angel ♪

08:49.518 --> 08:54.519
♪ Shine your light ♪

08:54.839 --> 08:58.540
♪ Be mine ♪

08:58.640 --> 09:02.101
♪ Be my candle in the night ♪

09:02.201 --> 09:04.841
(ominous music)

09:06.882 --> 09:09.142
Will you promise me something?

09:09.242 --> 09:10.022
Yeah.

09:10.122 --> 09:12.723
You throw away that necklace.

09:13.643 --> 09:17.124
I'm gonna leave it to you when I'm dead.

09:18.804 --> 09:22.065
Well, last night at the picnic,
you said you were scared.

09:22.165 --> 09:24.845
You don't need to be scared, Em.

09:25.845 --> 09:28.306
I want you to be happy.

09:28.406 --> 09:29.626
- Joey.
- Emma,

09:29.726 --> 09:33.707
I want you to promise me,
no matter how hard it is,

09:33.807 --> 09:36.708
or what you have to go through,

09:36.808 --> 09:39.428
you'll do everything you can to be happy.

09:39.528 --> 09:42.049
- I don't.
- Promise me, Emma.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.389
I promise.

09:46.489 --> 09:51.490
(gentle music)
(guests clapping)

09:59.292 --> 10:01.192
I'll be back.

10:01.292 --> 10:03.853
(solemn music)

10:34.219 --> 10:34.959
Are you all right?

10:35.059 --> 10:37.059
You just.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.420
I need to talk to you.

10:41.580 --> 10:42.360
I can't do this.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.621
I can't be married to you.

10:49.742 --> 10:51.742
Is this a joke?

10:53.343 --> 10:55.643
It was a mistake.

10:55.743 --> 10:56.483
I'm so sorry.

10:56.583 --> 10:57.323
This is all my fault.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.824
I should have said something.

11:02.344 --> 11:05.885
When exactly do you think
you should have said something?

11:05.985 --> 11:09.046
When you were walking down the aisle?

11:09.146 --> 11:11.246
Before you said I do?

11:11.346 --> 11:13.346
When?

11:14.547 --> 11:16.547
When?

11:16.947 --> 11:18.948
When Joey died.

11:21.268 --> 11:23.508
When Joey died, I was lost.

11:24.909 --> 11:26.909
I could barely breathe.

11:28.669 --> 11:30.870
And you were there for me.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.090
My mom and dad couldn't be.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.131
And I loved you for that.

11:35.231 --> 11:36.811
And I always will.

11:36.911 --> 11:38.912
But I don't love you.

11:41.152 --> 11:42.572
I thought I could.

11:42.672 --> 11:43.973
I thought I could make myself.

11:44.073 --> 11:46.073
I tried, but I can't.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.594
And you deserve better than that.

11:54.154 --> 11:56.475
Emma, we just got married.

12:00.196 --> 12:01.456
What are we gonna tell everyone?

12:01.556 --> 12:03.896
Tell them It was me.

12:03.996 --> 12:05.177
Tell them it was all my fault.

12:05.277 --> 12:09.357
Tell them whatever you
want, but I can't do this.

12:12.038 --> 12:14.038
I'm sorry, Harry.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.401
(gentle music)

12:30.242 --> 12:33.682
(keyboard keys clicking)

12:49.045 --> 12:51.686
Daddy, do you have adventures?

12:54.766 --> 12:56.767
Um.

12:58.567 --> 13:03.568
(family chattering)
(gentle music)

13:07.409 --> 13:08.189
I'm off out mum.

13:08.289 --> 13:10.189
Oh, hang on, hang on.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.290
Bye, love.

13:14.890 --> 13:17.491
(gentle music)

13:20.051 --> 13:23.512
I just finished this, and
I wanted to give it to you.

13:23.612 --> 13:25.232
It's the one you've been asking about.

13:25.332 --> 13:28.033
The one I've been asking
about for three weeks?

13:28.133 --> 13:30.073
It's the one you've been
asking about for five years.

13:30.173 --> 13:33.514
Oh, do you realise you
could've just emailed this to me?

13:33.614 --> 13:35.754
Yeah, I know.

13:35.854 --> 13:37.855
But I wanted to do this.

13:39.415 --> 13:41.656
What? What are you doing?

13:45.576 --> 13:47.577
I'm listening to you.

13:49.297 --> 13:52.098
(uplifting music)

13:55.418 --> 13:56.599
Hello?

13:56.699 --> 13:58.279
The evil twins want a word.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.439
Where are you?

13:59.539 --> 14:00.559
They're doing me head in,

14:00.659 --> 14:02.320
so I'm gonna take them to
the park for 20 minutes,

14:02.420 --> 14:03.800
try and tyre 'em out.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.120
Here you are, come here, come here,

14:05.220 --> 14:05.960
Where's the speaker?

14:06.060 --> 14:06.760
Hang on.

14:06.860 --> 14:07.601
Jump on.

14:07.701 --> 14:10.041
Daddy, can you read
us Peter Pan tonight?

14:10.141 --> 14:13.162
Yeah, I haven't seen
it for a while, actually.

14:13.262 --> 14:14.762
We've hidden it.

14:14.862 --> 14:15.922
Where?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.603
We've hid it in Emma's bag. (giggles)

14:18.703 --> 14:19.643
Emma's bag? When did you?

14:19.743 --> 14:21.963
I'll talk to you later, love.

14:22.063 --> 14:22.804
Okay right.

14:22.904 --> 14:23.684
Careful on the stairs.

14:23.784 --> 14:25.784
Thank you.

14:27.705 --> 14:32.366
(Emma laughing)
(Ben laughing)

14:32.466 --> 14:33.446
Stay in the pocket.

14:33.546 --> 14:34.286
Stay in the pocket.

14:34.386 --> 14:35.526
Do you ever watch boxing?

14:35.626 --> 14:36.326
No.

14:36.426 --> 14:37.366
Put your hands up.

14:37.466 --> 14:39.047
To win, you need to be at
this distance here, right?

14:39.147 --> 14:40.687
It's called the pocket.

14:40.787 --> 14:42.528
That means that you are
close enough to hit me

14:42.628 --> 14:43.328
with your left.

14:43.428 --> 14:45.088
but also, you're right.

14:45.188 --> 14:48.169
What if I don't wanna get hurt?

14:48.269 --> 14:50.269
You step back.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.810
Whew.

14:55.910 --> 14:58.231
See, now you can't get hurt,

15:02.991 --> 15:04.812
but you can't win either.

15:04.912 --> 15:07.512
(gentle music)

15:24.676 --> 15:26.416
What on Earth are you doing?

15:26.516 --> 15:27.696
You're missing your own wedding.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.497
I called it off,

15:29.597 --> 15:31.977
the wedding, the marriage, everything.

15:32.077 --> 15:33.297
You're already married.

15:33.397 --> 15:34.698
You know what I mean.

15:34.798 --> 15:35.738
We really don't.

15:35.838 --> 15:38.699
Emma, please don't do this.

15:38.799 --> 15:40.799
Harry is perfect.

15:41.119 --> 15:42.259
Why did you marry Dad?

15:42.359 --> 15:43.940
- Emma, listen to me.
- Tell me why.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.340
Because I loved him.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.140
There it is.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.820
I don't love Harry.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.921
What do you mean?

15:51.241 --> 15:53.941
I met someone, someone special.

15:54.041 --> 15:58.262
- I need to tell him how I feel.
- (huffs) This is insane.

15:58.362 --> 15:59.343
- I'm fully aware of that.
- Emma, you are

15:59.443 --> 16:01.783
at your own wedding.

16:01.883 --> 16:03.623
This isn't a fairytale.

16:03.723 --> 16:04.944
It's, it's real life.

16:05.044 --> 16:06.544
I know that but I need to try.

16:06.644 --> 16:07.384
Why?

16:07.484 --> 16:10.025
I love him, and I
made a promise to Joey.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.465
I promised her that I would do
whatever it took to be happy,

16:12.565 --> 16:13.705
and he makes me happy.

16:13.805 --> 16:14.786
What if he says no?

16:14.886 --> 16:15.626
Then he says no,

16:15.726 --> 16:18.026
but I need to know that
I tried one last time.

16:18.126 --> 16:19.386
This is ridiculous.

16:19.486 --> 16:21.487
Let her go.

16:26.968 --> 16:29.308
(Hannah sighs)

16:29.408 --> 16:31.409
Mom, please help me.

16:35.890 --> 16:38.530
Fine. (sighs)

16:40.971 --> 16:42.071
Can I just say something?

16:42.171 --> 16:44.311
If it ever seemed like I was pushing you

16:44.411 --> 16:45.472
into this marriage,

16:45.572 --> 16:46.312
Which it did.

16:46.412 --> 16:50.113
I did it 'cause I
wanted you to be happy.

16:50.213 --> 16:52.153
And safe.

16:52.253 --> 16:53.673
If I've learned one thing from this

16:53.773 --> 16:57.194
it's that happy and safe
aren't always the same thing.

16:57.294 --> 16:59.794
In fact, they very rarely are.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.535
(gentle music)

17:21.139 --> 17:23.139
To the park please.

17:25.819 --> 17:28.260
This is my story now.

17:29.940 --> 17:32.561
I've never written about this before.

17:32.661 --> 17:35.061
People have told me to often.

17:36.782 --> 17:38.362
I even tried a couple times,

17:38.462 --> 17:40.462
but I couldn't do it.

17:44.303 --> 17:47.064
I couldn't find the right ending.

17:49.624 --> 17:52.925
I didn't want to tell a sad story.

17:53.025 --> 17:55.945
I didn't want us to be a sad story.

18:02.587 --> 18:06.667
Eight years ago, I met
Jess, and we fell in love.

18:08.148 --> 18:12.829
We had two children together,
and the next day she died.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.370
That's our story.

18:18.470 --> 18:20.970
But it doesn't need to be all of it.

18:21.070 --> 18:22.531
We get a chance to change the story.

18:22.631 --> 18:24.631
I can see that now.

18:25.591 --> 18:26.371
For the longest time,

18:26.471 --> 18:29.692
I kept wondering what
Jess would've wanted,

18:29.792 --> 18:33.113
how she would've wanted me to love them.

18:34.033 --> 18:37.334
I never thought to ask
myself what I wanted.

18:37.434 --> 18:41.254
Turned out it was a pretty simple answer.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.495
I wanna be happy.

18:43.595 --> 18:46.835
I want me and the children to be happy.

18:49.996 --> 18:53.277
And I know now more than anything else,

18:54.837 --> 18:57.557
that's what Jess would've wanted,

19:00.518 --> 19:04.419
because that's what I
would've wanted for Jess.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.319
(uplifting music)

19:16.401 --> 19:18.482
So, here's the question.

19:20.722 --> 19:22.722
How does the story end?

19:23.603 --> 19:25.603
Well, here's the answer.

19:26.803 --> 19:28.804
I don't know.

19:29.924 --> 19:33.685
And that's fine by me,
and it's fine by them.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.285
We decide what happens next.

19:39.366 --> 19:41.106
This is our story now.

19:41.206 --> 19:44.007
(uplifting music)

20:12.772 --> 20:14.773
Ben!

20:15.173 --> 20:17.173
Ben!

20:22.494 --> 20:23.994
I was just coming to find you.

20:24.094 --> 20:26.435
I was just trying to find you.

20:26.535 --> 20:27.415
Why are you not wearing any shoes?

20:27.415 --> 20:28.235
I took them off.

20:28.335 --> 20:29.095
I thought it'd be easier to run on grass,

20:29.095 --> 20:30.396
so it's complicated, never mind,

20:30.496 --> 20:32.076
- I need to tell you something.
- No, me first.

20:32.176 --> 20:32.916
No, listen.

20:33.016 --> 20:33.716
Emma, listen.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.157
Look, this is gonna sound mad.

20:36.257 --> 20:37.637
You're about to marry someone else soon,

20:37.737 --> 20:38.457
but if I don't tell you this now,

20:38.457 --> 20:41.838
then I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

20:41.938 --> 20:42.878
Look, Emma, when I came to see you

20:42.978 --> 20:47.399
at the stage door that morning,
I wasn't honest with you.

20:47.499 --> 20:50.000
I said I was falling in love
with you, and that's not true.

20:50.100 --> 20:50.920
Okay?

20:51.020 --> 20:52.760
I'm in love with you.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.861
Emma, look, my life's a mess, right.

20:57.621 --> 20:59.441
I spend half my time
trying to hold it together,

20:59.541 --> 21:01.802
and the other half just
clearing up raisins.

21:01.902 --> 21:03.122
But I'm telling you this

21:03.222 --> 21:05.082
because I want you to be a part of it.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.603
I can't promise you anything.

21:07.703 --> 21:10.444
I promised things to Jess,
and they didn't come true,

21:10.544 --> 21:13.464
but I think we should do it anyway,

21:15.504 --> 21:19.925
because that's the risk that
you take when you love someone.

21:20.025 --> 21:22.026
Emma, I love you.

21:24.546 --> 21:25.687
Can I speak now?

21:25.787 --> 21:26.687
Yeah. Sorry.

21:26.787 --> 21:27.667
You said everybody has a moment

21:27.667 --> 21:29.727
in their life that changes them.

21:29.827 --> 21:31.928
After Joey died, I thought
I could make everyone happy.

21:32.028 --> 21:35.168
I made bad decisions,
and then I had my moment.

21:35.268 --> 21:37.489
Well, I never told you what my moment was.

21:37.589 --> 21:38.969
Yeah, what was it?

21:39.069 --> 21:39.889
It was you.

21:39.989 --> 21:41.770
It was meeting you.

21:41.870 --> 21:43.870
You are what I want.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.971
I love you, and I can love Jack and Poppy

21:47.071 --> 21:49.571
if you'll let me try, because
I want to be with you.

21:49.671 --> 21:51.612
I've wanted to be with you
since the moment that I met you.

21:51.712 --> 21:53.492
I want to be with all three of you.

21:53.592 --> 21:56.393
(uplifting music)

22:03.674 --> 22:05.654
I'm gonna need an annulment, by the way.

22:05.754 --> 22:06.695
What?

22:06.795 --> 22:08.795
I'll explain later.

22:09.915 --> 22:10.655
Daddy!

22:10.755 --> 22:12.756
Emma!

22:14.356 --> 22:18.037
Oh hello. Hello. (laughs)

22:19.557 --> 22:20.777
Oh, sorry.

22:20.877 --> 22:22.258
Sorry. I saw you from.

22:22.358 --> 22:24.258
Didn't know you were gonna start snogging.

22:24.358 --> 22:29.359
(Emma laughs)
(Ben laughs)

22:30.079 --> 22:32.220
So what happens next?

22:32.320 --> 22:34.880
(upbeat music)
