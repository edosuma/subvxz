WAS NO EASY JOB,

06:36.458 --> 06:38.834
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME
TO KEEPING THE PEACE.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.625

WHAT SHE ASKED,

06:40.625 --> 06:42.458

08:15.667 --> 08:18.083
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME...

08:23.125 --> 08:24.083
EXCUSE ME...

08:36.375 --> 08:38.291
Ahmad:
YOU SEE, RIGHT THERE...

08:38.291 --> 08:40.250
THAT WAS JUST LIKE BIG MAMA,

08:40.250 --> 08:41.500
ALWAYS KNOWIN'
JUST WHAT TO DO

08:41.500 --> 08:44.082
TO SET THINGS RIGHT.

08:44.082 --> 08:46.250
I USED TO THINK SHE AND I
HAD A SPECIAL CONNECTION,

08:46.250 --> 08:48.750
LIKE WE SHARED AN INSIDE JOKE
NO ONE ELSE WAS IN ON.

08:48.750 --> 08:54.417
'COURSE, IT WASN'T LONG,
I FOUND OUT SHE HAD THE SAME
CONNECTION WITH ALL OF US.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.125
YEAH, SHE WAS THE ROCK
OF THE JOSEPH FAMILY,

08:57.125 --> 08:59.166
THE ONE THAT HELD US
ALL TOGETHER.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.583
REVEREND, THAT SURE WAS
A GOOD SERMON TODAY,
I TELL YOU...

09:01.583 --> 09:04.250
PART OF THE REASON WE WERE
SUCH A TIGHT FAMILY

09:04.250 --> 09:06.709
IS 'CAUSE WE ALWAYS
HAD SUNDAY DINNERS
AT BIG MAMA'S.

09:06.709 --> 09:09.125
THEY WERE A TRADITION
THAT STARTED DOWN
IN MISSISSIPPI

09:09.125 --> 09:11.291
WHEN THE OLD FOLKS
GOT TOGETHER AFTER CHURCH

09:11.291 --> 09:14.667
TO TALK SMACK
AND CHOW DOWN WITH SOME
GOOD OLD SOUL FOOD.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.208
AND BIG MAMA KEPT
THE TRADITION GOING

09:16.208 --> 09:18.291
WHEN SHE AND GRANDDADDY
MOVED TO CHICAGO.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.542
HOLIDAYS, OF COURSE,
WERE BIGGER.

09:22.542 --> 09:25.291
MORE FOLKS, MORE EATS,
MORE SOULS,

09:25.291 --> 09:26.834
MORE SOUL FOOD.

09:29.625 --> 09:32.333
PEOPLE WOULD BE ROLLIN' IN
FROM ALL OVER,

09:32.333 --> 09:34.875
LIKE UNCLE REMUS,
WHO WAS ALWAYS HITTIN'
FOLKS UP FOR $2.00

09:34.875 --> 09:37.458
'CAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS BROKE.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.625
BEFORE GRANDDADDY DIED,
HE USED TO OWN A BARBER SHOP,

09:40.625 --> 09:43.166
CORNER STORE,
AND  A LAUNDROMAT.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.333
NOT BAD FOR A BLACK MAN
IN THOSE DAYS.

09:45.333 --> 09:47.667
'CAUSE OF THAT,

09:47.667 --> 09:50.375
RUMOR HAS IT MAMA JOE'S
GOT A BIG STASH OF LOOT
HIDDEN AWAY SOMEWHERE,

09:50.375 --> 09:52.041
BUT MAMA SAYS THAT'S
NOTHING BUT A MYTH.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.000
WE USED TO ALWAYS HAVE
EATING CONTESTS...

09:57.000 --> 10:00.041
WHICH THE REVEREND
WOULD ALWAYS WIN.

10:00.041 --> 10:02.500
THEN HE'D SPLIT
AFTER HE BUSTED SLIDES

10:02.500 --> 10:03.917
WITH MY MOM AND AUNTIES.

10:03.917 --> 10:06.375
I CAN STILL SEE MY DAD NOW

10:06.375 --> 10:08.792
LOOKIN' LIKE
HE WANTED TO BREAK
REVEREND WILLIAMS' NECK.

10:12.333 --> 10:16.375
LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
THERE'S BIG MAMA'S BROTHER,

10:16.375 --> 10:18.500
OLD UNCLE PETE...

10:18.500 --> 10:21.583
WHO AIN'T LEFT HIS ROOM
IN SOMETHING LIKE
10 YEARS NOW.

10:21.583 --> 10:25.000
GO.
GO.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.667
JUST SITS UP THERE WATCHING
HIS OLD TV SET.

10:27.667 --> 10:31.291
IT'S KIND OF A "LIGHTS ON,
NOBODY'S HOME" THING.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.250
LET'S GO!

10:32.250 --> 10:33.875
LET'S GET
OUTTA HERE.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.542
YEAH, THOSE WERE
THE GOOD DAYS, ALL RIGHT,

10:36.542 --> 10:38.083

THINGS TOOK A TURN.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.583
MAMA, MAMA!

10:39.583 --> 10:42.750
UNCLE PETE'S
MESSING WITH US!

10:42.750 --> 10:44.333
I'M TRYIN'
TO DO MY THING.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.208
CAN I DO MY THING?

10:47.208 --> 10:48.417
HIT ME!

10:48.417 --> 10:50.083
TAKE THAT.
YAAH.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.000
♪ I GOT SUNSHINE... ♪

10:55.375 --> 10:58.500
OOH, NO, BABY.
THAT'S TOO MUCH.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.291
JUST PUT ABOUT
4 PINCHES IN THERE.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.208
NOW, MAMA, HOW YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH TO PUT IN THERE

11:04.208 --> 11:06.875
WITHOUT USING
A MEASURING CUP?

11:06.875 --> 11:09.750
AND WHY WE GOT TO EAT
HAM HOCKS ANYWAY?
