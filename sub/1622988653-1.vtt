WEBVTT

02:20.307 --> 02:22.471
- Wally.
- Thanks everyone.

02:22.540 --> 02:24.869
That's how it's done.

02:24.938 --> 02:27.806
Give it up, Blade Bandits.

02:27.875 --> 02:30.974
Knifecorp,
Knifecorp, Knifecorp.

02:31.043 --> 02:33.350
- All right, all
right, all right.

02:33.419 --> 02:34.549
We don't sell knives.

02:37.588 --> 02:38.718
I'm going to say that again.

02:39.689 --> 02:42.887
We don't sell knives.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.659
We sell ourselves.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.696
Yeah.
- Like prostitution?

02:53.307 --> 02:55.669
- Now, when I look
out at this group,

02:55.738 --> 02:57.572
recent high school graduates,

02:57.641 --> 03:01.246
some 11th graders who just
got their parents' permission,

03:01.315 --> 03:05.547
I don't see salespeople
and saleswomen, of course.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.979
I see business owners.

03:09.048 --> 03:11.454
I see entrepreneurs.

03:11.523 --> 03:15.458
I see the future leaders
of this generation.

03:16.957 --> 03:17.823
Raul, now!

03:24.371 --> 03:27.272
Knifecorp,
Knifecorp, Knifecorp,

03:27.341 --> 03:29.868
Knifecorp, Knifecorp, Knifecorp.

03:31.972 --> 03:34.576
- Okay, okay, quiet down.

03:34.645 --> 03:37.678
I know we're all excited to get
out there and start selling,

03:37.747 --> 03:40.945
but knocking on doors,
making pitches to strangers

03:41.014 --> 03:42.749
all day isn't easy

03:44.017 --> 03:45.620
unless you know your why.

03:46.888 --> 03:49.327
That is why I would
like to call up

03:49.396 --> 03:52.396
a very special new recruit
to the Blade Bandits.

03:53.895 --> 03:55.366
I read a lot of applications,

03:57.635 --> 03:58.633
but this one,

04:00.033 --> 04:02.868
this one literally
brought me to tears.

04:02.937 --> 04:07.543
All the way from the Far East,

04:07.612 --> 04:10.810
please welcome, Buddy Chang.

04:18.051 --> 04:20.589
Why don't you tell
everybody your why, Buddy?

04:20.658 --> 04:23.691
Why are you here with
us today at Knifecorp?

04:26.125 --> 04:28.762
- My name is Buddy Chang.

04:28.831 --> 04:32.568
I had barely taken my first
few steps as a child, when I--

04:32.637 --> 04:35.340
Standing above her body
was my father who was--

04:35.409 --> 04:37.870
So I knew I had to come to
America and make a diff--

04:37.939 --> 04:39.740
And now I am here to
use this opportunity

04:39.809 --> 04:41.038
to save as many lives as I can.

04:41.107 --> 04:43.975
So Knifecorp may have
killed my mother,

04:44.044 --> 04:45.548
but it saved my life.

04:46.882 --> 04:47.748
Thank you.

04:53.922 --> 04:55.921
- Thank you for your courage.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.959
Now with that in mind, it
is time to cut you loose,

05:01.028 --> 05:02.664
see how you do in the field.

05:03.965 --> 05:06.030
Now, first-time sellers,
you'll be selling in groups.

05:06.099 --> 05:09.132
You two with Wally Banks.

05:09.201 --> 05:12.674
Can my girlfriend come, too,
we're kind of, you know,

05:12.743 --> 05:13.642
boyfriend-girlfriend.
- I'm not your girlfriend,

05:13.711 --> 05:14.977
you psycho.
- Yeah, that's fine,

05:15.045 --> 05:17.041
I'm not getting involved
with your high school drama.

05:17.110 --> 05:17.875
- Thank you.
- Wait, what the hell?

05:17.944 --> 05:19.483
I don't want to be with them.

05:19.552 --> 05:20.751
- We're inseparable.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.552
- Stop saying that to
people, that's how rumors

05:22.621 --> 05:23.720
get started.
- I only say it to you.

05:23.789 --> 05:26.149
- Real quick, if you
ever feel unsafe, you,

05:26.218 --> 05:27.484
Take your
knives and leave.

05:27.553 --> 05:31.088
- And if you show back up
here without your knives?

05:31.157 --> 05:33.530
- You're going to
have to pay 25 bucks.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.895
- Okay, that's 2,500 bucks.

05:35.964 --> 05:37.094
All right, chief?

05:37.163 --> 05:38.029
Don't lose 'em.

05:39.165 --> 05:43.474
Lastly, we have the
new recruit incentive.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.807
First newbie to sell
a platinum series set

05:46.876 --> 05:50.173
gets a deluxe set to
take home with him,

05:50.242 --> 05:55.453
plus $1,000 cash.

05:56.017 --> 05:57.147
Welcome to Knifecorp.

05:58.517 --> 06:00.557
What's the game
plan when we get there?

06:00.626 --> 06:01.625
Should we team up?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.428
- Well, me being
the obvious leader--

06:03.497 --> 06:04.924
- Being third-string
quarterback does not

06:04.993 --> 06:07.058
qualify you as a leader.

06:07.127 --> 06:10.061
- And having daddy issues
does not qualify you

06:10.130 --> 06:12.063
to make fun of me,
I'm not your bad dad,

06:12.132 --> 06:14.868
even though I know you
want me to be your daddy.

06:14.937 --> 06:16.136
- Ew.
- You want me to adopt you.

06:16.205 --> 06:18.938
- You're so weird, you
take it too far sometimes.

06:19.007 --> 06:20.841
- Hey guys.
- What are you gonna do?

06:20.910 --> 06:23.712
- According to the map, our
territory is right here.

06:23.781 --> 06:25.681
I think we can stop
fighting and start selling.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.683
- Fine, let's
divide up the block.

06:27.752 --> 06:28.884
- Yes, divide and conquer.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.456
That is the only way to
survive a murderous riot

06:31.525 --> 06:32.591
In the Cambodian prison camp.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.691
- Dude, we're just
selling knives, relax.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.891
- No, we don't sell
knives, we sell ourselves.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.259
- I know.
- And he's right,

06:39.328 --> 06:40.527
we need to divide and conquer,
so we can win that prize.

06:40.596 --> 06:43.094
- That's the exact opposite
of what we need to do.

06:43.163 --> 06:44.931
I'm going to sell
the first master set,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.933
get the prize money,
and get my own place

06:47.002 --> 06:49.001
so I can get as far
from my dad as possible.

06:49.070 --> 06:51.707
- Yes, with the money, I
can finally pay the ransom

06:51.776 --> 06:53.610
and free my sister
from the triads.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.579
- Ooh. I hate to bust this
beautiful family picture

06:55.648 --> 06:57.108
you got going on, but
you guys should all know

06:57.177 --> 06:59.011
that I'm going to
win this competition,

06:59.080 --> 07:01.882
because daddy's going to
pimp out his Nissan Sinatra.

07:03.755 --> 07:06.689
- You are so lame, I was so
happy when Sarah dumped you.

07:06.758 --> 07:08.724
- Sarah did not dump me,
just so everyone knows,

07:08.793 --> 07:09.892
it was extremely mutual.

07:09.961 --> 07:12.794
And B, don't act like
you hang out with Sarah.

07:12.863 --> 07:14.961
All right, what, you're like
the second, third hottest girl

07:15.030 --> 07:16.633
at the school and you
don't have any friends.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.228
Does anyone else
think that's weird?

07:18.297 --> 07:19.062
Hot girls are supposed
to have, like,

07:19.131 --> 07:20.769
four to five friends, right?

07:20.838 --> 07:21.904
We've all seen "Mean Girls."

07:21.972 --> 07:24.806
- I pity the women who
let you touch them.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.809
- Just so everyone's
clear, I get tons of pussy.

07:27.878 --> 07:29.547
- Oh yeah? Well you
know who probably gets

07:29.616 --> 07:31.043
way more pussy than all of us?

07:31.112 --> 07:33.980
Van, let's sell some knives
so we can all get more.

07:34.049 --> 07:35.014
- Pussy?
- All right,

07:35.083 --> 07:36.382
Wolf of Wally Street,

07:36.451 --> 07:39.557
what are you going to do with
the prize money if you win?

07:39.626 --> 07:40.888
- I would,

07:42.728 --> 07:43.427
Sorry, one second.

07:46.028 --> 07:47.895
Hey, Mom, is everything okay?

07:47.964 --> 07:50.667
- I didn't mean to bother
you, I just wanted to see

07:50.736 --> 07:52.196
how your first day was going.

07:53.233 --> 07:54.132
- It's fine,

07:55.268 --> 07:56.541
is the house all done?

07:57.911 --> 08:00.941
- Yeah, a couple of the guys
from the precinct came down

08:02.044 --> 08:05.682
to, the rest of this stuff,

08:05.751 --> 08:08.080
but I don't want you to
worry about me so much,

08:08.149 --> 08:09.818
everything's going to be okay.

08:09.887 --> 08:12.557
- Okay, Mom, there's a
competition going on.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.153
If I win, I can pull
some money together.

08:15.222 --> 08:16.825
- I don't think that's
going to work, Wally.

08:16.894 --> 08:20.158
But listen, be careful,
okay, and have fun.

08:21.294 --> 08:23.260
- That doesn't mean
I'm not going to try.

08:23.329 --> 08:24.327
I love you.

08:24.396 --> 08:25.999
- I love you too, sweetheart.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.708
- Oh my God, $10,000.

08:35.077 --> 08:36.581
- Okay, how are we
dividing up the block?

08:36.650 --> 08:37.945
- Already done.

08:38.014 --> 08:39.080
- That was fast.

08:39.148 --> 08:40.849
- Yeah, so I'm going
to take even numbers,

08:40.918 --> 08:42.050
Buddy's going to take odds.

08:42.119 --> 08:43.252
Jed's going to take the
condos on Spring Street

08:43.320 --> 08:46.250
and that leaves you with
the do-not-knock houses.

08:46.319 --> 08:48.087
- What, seriously?

08:48.156 --> 08:49.355
That's not fair.

08:49.424 --> 08:50.925
- Dude, you're like the
best salesman in the group,

08:50.994 --> 08:52.256
it's actually extremely fair.

08:52.325 --> 08:53.664
- It's salesperson.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.899
- It's death of a salesman.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.602
- Who cares, look, I
thought we were teaming up.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.967
We could split the
new prize four ways.

09:00.036 --> 09:01.199
That's a lot of money.

09:01.268 --> 09:02.567
Come on, Buddy.

09:02.636 --> 09:05.005
You said the only way to survive
was to divide and conquer.

09:05.074 --> 09:07.271
- Yes, that was for a
prison camp, though.

09:07.340 --> 09:10.615
$10,000 can finally
arm the resistance

09:10.684 --> 09:12.177
and liberate my village
once and for all.

09:12.246 --> 09:13.618
- Same.
- All right then,

09:13.687 --> 09:14.452
that's settled.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.280
Come on, let's take a selfie.

09:16.349 --> 09:17.721
- No, that's not fair.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.021
- Get in.

09:21.090 --> 09:21.956
Selfie time.

09:23.389 --> 09:25.157
Okay, So let's meet
back here at nine

09:25.226 --> 09:26.697
and winner buys dinner.

09:26.766 --> 09:27.929
- Not going to be me.
- Damn it,

09:27.998 --> 09:28.964
I don't have any reception.

09:29.032 --> 09:31.097
Whatever, I'll tag
you guys later.

09:55.388 --> 09:59.598
- It's Knifecorp.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.876
- Can I help you with something?

10:15.210 --> 10:17.044
- No, no, you look busy.

10:17.113 --> 10:18.980
Sorry to bother you,
have a good day.

10:19.049 --> 10:19.948
- Wait a second.

10:21.018 --> 10:22.017
So what is this?

10:22.086 --> 10:24.084
You peddle cheap
silverware door to door

10:24.153 --> 10:26.691
like one of those
Slicecorp kids?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.220
- It's Knifecorp actually.

10:28.289 --> 10:29.288
And we don't sell
knives, we sell--

10:29.357 --> 10:31.421
- Well, you know
what, sorry I asked.

10:31.490 --> 10:32.756
I'm not interested
in buying anything

10:32.825 --> 10:36.228
and I don't have time for
the whole song and dance.

10:36.297 --> 10:37.966
- Not even for the
son of a deputy?

10:38.035 --> 10:39.836
- Especially not for
the son of a deputy.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.706
Good luck with the next house.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.008
- Wait, my dad was Eddie Banks,

10:43.076 --> 10:45.303
maybe you've heard of him?
He was killed by a 14--

10:45.372 --> 10:48.977
- 14-year-old gang banger
with no priors, yeah.

10:49.046 --> 10:51.782
Every cop west of
Texas knows the story.

10:51.851 --> 10:54.444
I'm sorry about your father,
it's a dangerous job.

10:54.513 --> 10:57.117
- Yeah, he died doing it and
now my mom's about to lose

10:57.186 --> 10:59.053
the house and nobody's doing
a damn thing about it except--

10:59.122 --> 11:00.351
- Like I said, I'm sorry.

11:01.454 --> 11:03.222
But if you came here
looking for help

11:03.291 --> 11:05.994
or looking for some
sucker to buy your crap,

11:06.063 --> 11:07.897
you came to the wrong house.

11:07.966 --> 11:09.965
- Is it the wrong house
or the wrong time?

11:10.034 --> 11:11.230
I mean, I'm pretty
available this week,

11:11.299 --> 11:13.034
so just let me know when--
- Banks.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.806
I am trying to be nice here.

11:17.206 --> 11:20.679
Now, I think it's time you
leave before I report you.

11:22.475 --> 11:23.341
- Okay.

11:34.223 --> 11:36.024
I couldn't help but notice
that you're really struggling.

11:36.093 --> 11:37.025
- Look,

11:37.094 --> 11:38.763
I appreciate the effort.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.098
I get it.

11:40.167 --> 11:43.361
I'm just not interested in
buying anything right now.

11:43.430 --> 11:45.132
- Please allow me,

11:45.201 --> 11:47.233
I can handle this for
you in one second.

11:49.403 --> 11:50.775
Can you hold this?
- No.

11:52.043 --> 11:52.876
- That's fine.

12:06.255 --> 12:08.056
See, that's better.

12:08.125 --> 12:08.991
No more,

12:10.193 --> 12:11.159
all lives matter?

12:11.227 --> 12:14.227
- Yeah, I'm not
really political.

12:14.296 --> 12:16.229
Now, excuse me, I have
to get back inside.

12:16.298 --> 12:19.133
- Wait, just let me give
you a demonstration.

12:19.202 --> 12:20.904
There's absolutely
no obligation to buy

12:20.973 --> 12:23.335
but I really need the practice.

12:23.404 --> 12:26.206
- Okay, you got two minutes, go.

12:26.275 --> 12:28.241
- Oh, can we do this
inside actually?

12:32.479 --> 12:33.345
- Okay.

12:34.548 --> 12:38.350
But remember, I'm
listening, I'm not buying.

12:38.419 --> 12:39.516
- Great, perfect.

12:39.585 --> 12:41.254
- Do we have a deal?

12:41.323 --> 12:42.088
- Deal.

12:42.157 --> 12:43.520
- Close the door behind you.

12:43.589 --> 12:44.455
- Okay.

12:46.295 --> 12:50.835
- This world is so
unstable, unpredictable.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.102
That is why the least you
can do for your family's sake

12:54.171 --> 12:57.402
is to bring stability into
your kitchen with Knifecorp.

12:57.471 --> 13:00.504
- Wow, you really must've
seen some shit, huh?

13:01.915 --> 13:05.146
- If by shit you mean
watching the lives

13:05.215 --> 13:07.049
of everyone you've
ever loved taken

13:07.118 --> 13:09.821
by the hands of a broken system,

13:10.616 --> 13:12.989
then yes, I've seen some shit.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.188
- Honey, why don't
we buy some knives

13:14.257 --> 13:16.157
so this nice man can leave.

13:17.326 --> 13:18.058
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

13:18.127 --> 13:19.426
We will, we'll buy knives.

13:19.495 --> 13:22.262
Why don't you go get the kids
and I'll take care of this.

13:22.331 --> 13:23.395
- It's a little early.

13:24.498 --> 13:26.332
- Traffic, there's so
much traffic today.

13:27.369 --> 13:28.268
- Again.

13:28.337 --> 13:29.403
- Hey Buddy,

13:29.471 --> 13:32.272
you mind showing me that
demonstration again?

13:34.948 --> 13:36.639
- Which knife would
you like to see again?

13:36.708 --> 13:39.081
- Oh I don't know, you have
so many to choose from,

13:39.150 --> 13:40.181
maybe the big one.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.919
- Oh, I have even bigger.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.415
I bet you do.

13:43.484 --> 13:45.153
- You know I once
saw a video internet

13:45.222 --> 13:46.418
that started just like this.

13:46.487 --> 13:47.617
- Say internet again.

13:47.686 --> 13:48.827
- Internet.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.061
America is great.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.832
- It is, God bless.

14:03.174 --> 14:04.304
- Don't touch anything.

14:05.341 --> 14:07.439
It's an historic house.

14:07.508 --> 14:08.374
- Yes, sir.

14:26.725 --> 14:28.526
- Strange house, right?

14:28.595 --> 14:30.935
- Yeah, really nice.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.464
- We just moved in.

14:32.533 --> 14:33.399
- We?

14:35.305 --> 14:36.204
- Sorry, I,

14:40.343 --> 14:42.441
I just lost Brenda
a few months ago.

14:44.281 --> 14:46.148
Old habits, you know?

14:46.217 --> 14:48.084
- I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.086
- Finn, Angus Finn.

14:51.552 --> 14:54.585
I suggest you get started
because time is ticking

14:54.654 --> 14:58.226
and remember I'm not
buying, just listening.

14:59.197 --> 15:00.965
- Loud and clear, Mr. Finn.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.725
Now let me ask you
a simple question,

15:02.794 --> 15:05.167
are you a quality or a
quantity type of guy?

15:09.570 --> 15:12.438
Well, I'm looking around
and I'm guessing you're

15:12.507 --> 15:15.078
the kind of guy who
cares about quality.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.575
I'm the same way,
and so is Knifecorp.

15:21.813 --> 15:25.484
When I hold up this Potato
Carver Plus in front of me,

15:25.553 --> 15:27.255
what's the first thing you see?

15:27.324 --> 15:28.190
- A knife.

15:29.059 --> 15:32.062
- Okay, but what specifically?

15:32.131 --> 15:33.624
- A virgin holding a knife.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.727
- Okay, but what about the knife

15:37.796 --> 15:40.334
that the virgin is
holding really stands out?

15:40.403 --> 15:42.941
- That he's got about
10 seconds left.

15:44.341 --> 15:46.538
- Well, that's more about
the virgin than the knife.

15:46.607 --> 15:47.372
- And time.

15:47.441 --> 15:49.046
- Wait, do you have a penny?

15:50.644 --> 15:51.510
Please.

15:57.453 --> 15:58.619
Now tell me, Mr. Finn,

15:58.688 --> 16:01.388
have you ever seen a
pair of scissors so sharp

16:01.457 --> 16:03.456
that they can cut
right through copper?

16:03.525 --> 16:06.228
- Oh, sure, let's just
deface some US currency.

16:07.496 --> 16:10.232
- Well, no pair of scissors
can deface US currency

16:10.301 --> 16:14.302
as quickly or easily
as Knifecorp's.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.471
Just got to use a little
pressure and then,

16:20.641 --> 16:22.046
ah shit!

16:22.115 --> 16:23.047
I mean shoot.

16:23.116 --> 16:23.982
- Stay here.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.064
- There's no service?

16:40.133 --> 16:41.197
That's weird.

16:42.399 --> 16:43.265
Ah, shit.

17:59.608 --> 18:00.407
Thank you.

18:00.476 --> 18:01.838
- This has been a real pleasure.

18:01.907 --> 18:03.510
Thank you for trespassing.

18:05.944 --> 18:07.210
- What if instead of
the platinum series,

18:07.279 --> 18:09.714
we go silver lining set, it's
basically the same thing,

18:09.783 --> 18:10.782
but without the scissors,

18:10.851 --> 18:11.950
still great for cutting
things in there.

18:12.019 --> 18:13.084
Mrs. Coleman, I know
you said that you have

18:13.153 --> 18:16.193
cut things before, this
seems really in line

18:16.262 --> 18:17.328
with your wants.

18:17.396 --> 18:19.592
- Thanks, but good luck
with the next house.

18:19.661 --> 18:21.627
- Actually, it's not
really the next house,

18:21.696 --> 18:22.495
it's more of a last house,

18:22.564 --> 18:24.531
the Williamsons down the street.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.929
They've they just texted
me because they're looking

18:26.998 --> 18:29.833
for two platinum
series sets, I guess.

18:29.902 --> 18:31.274
They're going with.
- Hold on.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.309
Debbie bought all of this?

18:33.378 --> 18:35.443
- Well, Debbie, she bought
one, but it was her husband,

18:35.512 --> 18:36.708
David, he bought--

18:36.777 --> 18:37.809
- Get out.

18:37.878 --> 18:39.144
- He bought like
three, 'cause he's got

18:39.213 --> 18:41.317
some friends, I guess, and
he hates going to the mall

18:41.386 --> 18:42.485
to shop for them,

18:42.554 --> 18:43.786
just talking about how
much of a drag it is

18:43.855 --> 18:48.423
to go to the mall, and you
got to park at the mall,

18:48.492 --> 18:50.491
and be at the mall.

18:52.023 --> 18:53.725
Don't want to go to the mall.

18:53.794 --> 18:54.858
- We'll take four.

18:54.927 --> 18:55.926
- Okay, cool, thanks.

18:55.995 --> 18:58.664
And Mr. Coleman, I
just want to say,

18:58.733 --> 19:00.699
on my mom's side, I'm
actually one-18th black

19:00.768 --> 19:02.833
because I'm Sicilian,
so I feel like

19:02.902 --> 19:04.373
this transaction makes sense.

19:04.442 --> 19:06.870
I feel like there's
some good history.

19:06.939 --> 19:08.146
It all feels right.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.381
- Are you sure you live alone?

19:12.450 --> 19:15.219
Because I could have swore
I heard somebody upstairs.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.255
- Why don't you quit
before you get hurt again?

19:18.324 --> 19:19.190
Excuse me.

19:20.491 --> 19:21.824
- That's a lot of meat.

19:21.892 --> 19:24.360
You're going to need some sharp
knives to carve all that up.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.362
- I have knives, thank you.

19:26.431 --> 19:27.759
- Not like these, you don't.

19:29.027 --> 19:30.729
This Carver Deluxe will carve

19:30.798 --> 19:32.434
right through that like butter.

19:34.505 --> 19:36.372
- Fine, you got
five more minutes.

19:36.441 --> 19:37.573
Make yourself useful.

19:37.642 --> 19:40.310
- Great, here, take this
one, I'll use the Mini.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.642
Let's get to work.

19:42.711 --> 19:44.413
- I'm going to regret this.

19:44.482 --> 19:46.778
- You won't regret this
purchase, Mrs. Robinson.

19:46.847 --> 19:49.011
Actually, it's really
more like an investment.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.617
- Well, it is sharp.

19:50.686 --> 19:52.388
- You're very
sharp for noticing.

19:52.457 --> 19:53.719
Us ladies got to stay sharp.

19:53.788 --> 19:55.292
- You know what,
stop saying sharp.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.594
- Sorry.

19:56.662 --> 19:57.921
- Look, you don't have to
sell me so hard on this,

19:57.990 --> 19:59.021
loosen up.

19:59.090 --> 20:00.660
Do you want a glass of wine?

20:00.729 --> 20:02.629
- Oh, I'm actually not
old enough to drink.

20:02.698 --> 20:03.497
- Yeah, well, I'm not old enough

20:03.566 --> 20:05.665
to be going through menopause.

20:05.734 --> 20:06.466
So there's that.

20:06.535 --> 20:08.404
Will it be cash or credit?

20:08.473 --> 20:09.801
- Oh my God, you're amazing.

20:11.641 --> 20:13.772
- Can you feel that
big blade energy

20:13.841 --> 20:15.510
slicing through that bad cut.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.679
- I got to admit, it's
a damn good knife.

20:19.748 --> 20:21.648
- Oh, it's more
than just a knife.

20:21.717 --> 20:22.482
That is a--
- It's getting time

20:22.551 --> 20:25.487
for you to go is what it is.

20:25.556 --> 20:27.258
- Yeah, I guess so.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.360
Thank you for your
time, Mr. Finn.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.361
- Thank you, pal.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.958
It's actually been nice
having some company.

20:35.027 --> 20:37.433
- I had a really nice time, too.

20:37.502 --> 20:40.469
- Whoa, I'm not going
to go steady with you.

20:40.538 --> 20:41.371
- Huh?

20:45.070 --> 20:47.410
You seem to really
like that Carver.

20:47.479 --> 20:49.005
- Gets the job done.

20:49.074 --> 20:51.678
- And speaking of
jobs, before I go,

20:51.747 --> 20:54.417
I really wouldn't be doing my
job if I didn't at least ask

20:54.486 --> 20:56.353
if you wanted to purchase
your own Carver Deluxe.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.851
- We had a deal.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.051
I let you into my
home on the condition

21:02.120 --> 21:05.021
you did not try to
sell me and you lied.

21:05.090 --> 21:06.495
- Daddy.

21:06.564 --> 21:08.497
Go back
upstairs, sweetie.

21:08.566 --> 21:09.532
- Daddy, who is that?

21:09.600 --> 21:10.862
- Daddy, I thought
you lived alone?

21:10.931 --> 21:12.402
- Get out of my house.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.270
- Daddy, please.
- Now!

21:13.339 --> 21:14.004
- Please don't hurt him, please,

21:14.073 --> 21:14.938
he didn't do anything.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.407
Come on--
- You are a liar.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.969
- Please Dad, Dad,
- I don't like liars.

21:19.038 --> 21:21.675
- Stop it.
- Belle, go to your room!

21:25.946 --> 21:27.045
Now, I'm going to
make you a deal.

21:27.114 --> 21:29.848
You don't tell anybody
about what you just saw

21:30.984 --> 21:32.884
and I won't rip your
fucking head off.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.359
Is that a deal?

21:35.428 --> 21:36.360
- Deal.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.328
- Yeah?
- Yes.

21:47.506 --> 21:48.339
- Get out.

21:56.647 --> 21:57.612
- What the hell?

22:02.081 --> 22:02.947
Perfect.

22:05.183 --> 22:07.424
- I guess Wally's not coming,

22:07.493 --> 22:09.393
it's 'cause he's probably
logging in a mountain of sales,

22:09.462 --> 22:14.024
so I say the trifecta council
of Tanya, Jed, and Buddy

22:14.093 --> 22:18.028
nominates Tanya as our winner
and buyer of the dinner.

22:18.097 --> 22:20.569
Tanya, please give us a speech.

22:20.638 --> 22:23.000
- Thank you, Jed, for that
wonderful introduction.

22:23.069 --> 22:25.772
I see that being out in the
field has changed you already.

22:25.841 --> 22:26.940
- Yeah, it totally changed me.

22:27.009 --> 22:28.108
- As you guys know, I've
been trying to save up

22:28.177 --> 22:31.514
some cash to move out,
and thanks to Knifecorp,

22:31.583 --> 22:34.451
I can start packing tonight.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.552
- Look who it is, Mr. Big Knife.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.983
- Wally.
- How many units did you move?

22:39.052 --> 22:40.820
- I'm really not
in the mood, Jed.

22:40.889 --> 22:41.988
- Come on, Wally.

22:42.057 --> 22:43.823
Stop acting like someone
tried to make you eat

22:43.892 --> 22:47.024
your brother's remains
and take a joke.

22:47.093 --> 22:48.392
- You get me, dude.

22:48.461 --> 22:51.435
You tired from filling
out all those order forms?

22:51.504 --> 22:52.964
- Hey, does anyone
know the name of Beauty

22:53.033 --> 22:54.603
in "Beauty and the Beast?"

22:57.103 --> 23:00.103
- Yeah, it's like
Jasmine, right?

23:01.910 --> 23:03.109
I mean, you probably
know the full name

23:03.178 --> 23:05.108
'cause you're like the
Disney fan, so, what is it?

23:05.177 --> 23:08.452
- Okay, A, that's sexist
and, B, my dad hates Disney.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.751
He said only a privileged
white man would write a story

23:10.820 --> 23:13.215
about a girl who needs to
be saved by her friends.

23:14.890 --> 23:16.724
- Janelle, I'm
ringing the bell here.

23:18.058 --> 23:19.859
- I think it was Jasmine.
- Yeah, it was Jasmine.

23:19.928 --> 23:21.564
What is Disney?

23:21.633 --> 23:22.895
- That was kind of
random, what's up?

23:22.964 --> 23:25.062
- This guy, he said
he lived alone,

23:25.131 --> 23:26.899
but he had a
daughter named Belle,

23:28.134 --> 23:30.133
it's like he was hiding
her or something.

23:30.202 --> 23:31.838
And he like freaked
out on me at the end

23:31.907 --> 23:32.906
and kicked me out of his house.

23:32.975 --> 23:34.676
- Wait, who names
their daughter Belle?

23:34.745 --> 23:36.678
That's like naming your
daughter Ding-Dong.

23:36.747 --> 23:38.113
No offense.

23:38.182 --> 23:40.880
- Well, Belle is a French word
for beautiful woman or girl.

23:40.949 --> 23:42.486
- Dude, where are you from?

23:43.314 --> 23:44.647
- The East.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.886
- Where, give me the exact GPS
coordinates of your origin.

23:46.955 --> 23:48.054
- Oh my God, who cares?

23:48.123 --> 23:49.122
Stop being so racist.
- I just, I just wanna--

23:49.191 --> 23:51.891
- Wally, tell us
what we want to know.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.431
How much did you sell?

23:54.160 --> 23:55.092
- I didn't.

23:56.965 --> 23:58.029
- You didn't,

23:58.098 --> 23:59.569
you didn't what?

23:59.638 --> 24:00.637
- I didn't sell anything.

24:00.706 --> 24:01.872
- How could you not
have sold anything?

24:01.940 --> 24:03.306
These knives, like,
literally sell themselves.

24:03.375 --> 24:06.510
- I mean because you guys gave
me the do-not-solicit houses.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.776
- Exactly, and
you're going to be

24:08.845 --> 24:10.976
like the first person
to go to those houses.

24:11.045 --> 24:12.208
- And the last.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.244
- Great way of thinking, guys.

24:15.313 --> 24:17.719
- Wally, we're just
messing with you.

24:17.788 --> 24:19.853
You'll go out and do some demos
tomorrow and get something,

24:19.922 --> 24:21.121
I'm sure of it.

24:21.190 --> 24:22.322
- Dude, honestly, I'm
not even messing with you

24:22.391 --> 24:24.528
as much right now as me
and my football friends

24:24.597 --> 24:25.930
mess with each other.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.264
If you want, we can pretend
like you made a bunch of money

24:27.333 --> 24:30.930
and then keep pretending and
let you pay for the bill.

24:30.999 --> 24:31.865
- Thanks, Jed.

24:32.935 --> 24:33.600
Goodnight, guys.

24:33.669 --> 24:36.133
- Wally, just remember,

24:36.202 --> 24:38.806
don't come back
without your knives.

24:39.809 --> 24:41.006
- That was like spot on.
- Wait,

24:41.075 --> 24:42.073
where are my knives?

24:43.176 --> 24:44.175
- You're going to go right now?

24:44.244 --> 24:46.550
Is this still crazy
hide-a-daughter guy

24:46.619 --> 24:47.618
we've been hearing about?

24:47.687 --> 24:49.245
- I don't have a lot
of other options.

24:49.314 --> 24:51.082
See you guys tomorrow.

24:51.151 --> 24:53.249
- You can't just
let him go alone.

24:53.318 --> 24:55.790
- Wally, wait,
we'll go with you,

24:55.859 --> 24:57.660
gotta walk off this pizza,

24:57.729 --> 24:58.826
I want to see this Jasmine girl.

24:58.895 --> 25:00.223
I got reasons.

25:00.292 --> 25:01.598
- I appreciate it.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.666
- Wally, you have a good soul.

25:02.735 --> 25:03.967
I will follow you
into battle, brother,

25:04.036 --> 25:07.329
for blood is thicker than--
- Well, I'm coming, too.

25:07.398 --> 25:10.299
Breaking into some psycho's
house still beats going home.

25:10.368 --> 25:12.576
- No, wait, we're
not breaking in.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.237
I'm just going to knock on
the door and calmly explain

25:14.306 --> 25:16.778
the situation and ask
for my knives back.

25:16.847 --> 25:18.516
What's the worst
that can happen?

25:20.312 --> 25:22.850
- From my experience< you
could possibly get stabbed.

25:22.919 --> 25:24.252
- Did he say stabbed?

25:24.320 --> 25:26.722
'Cause I was thinking he could
use our knives against us.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.725
- Honestly, I thought Hong
Kong was kind of really cool

25:29.794 --> 25:31.122
and everything, but I was
a little bit grossed out

25:31.191 --> 25:32.457
'cause I saw them kill a snake.

25:32.526 --> 25:33.558
The best part about it was
that it made me appreciate

25:33.627 --> 25:36.358
India more, how do
you feel about China?

25:36.427 --> 25:37.733
I've never been there.

25:37.802 --> 25:38.800
- Are you guys cold?

25:39.804 --> 25:41.132
Oh fuck.

25:41.201 --> 25:42.000
- Not really actually.

25:42.069 --> 25:43.301
- My nipples are so hard, look.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.642
- Oh wow, hard nipples,
your mom must be so proud.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.809
- This one's covered by the--
- He's not answering.

25:47.878 --> 25:49.206
I'll just come back tomorrow.

25:49.275 --> 25:51.142
- Okay, cool.
- No, no, no.

25:51.211 --> 25:52.277
If you don't get
those knives back,

25:52.345 --> 25:53.344
Van is just going to
make you pay for them

25:53.413 --> 25:55.212
and they're, like,
really expensive.

25:55.281 --> 25:56.547
It happened to Sarah's brother.

25:56.616 --> 25:59.623
- Oh really, okay, oh, you're
going to bring up Sarah.

25:59.692 --> 26:00.658
I know what you're doing.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.026
You're trying to
make me feel pain

26:02.094 --> 26:02.893
'cause you like me and you
don't know how to show love.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.193
- You're so dramatic, I can't.

26:05.261 --> 26:06.894
- Has someone told Buddy
that me and Sarah had sex

26:06.963 --> 26:08.632
on the football field,
'cause I feel like--

26:08.701 --> 26:09.934
- Why don't you
just stop talking.

26:10.002 --> 26:10.534
- I just feel like it's
something he should know.

26:10.603 --> 26:11.368
- Hello, guys.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.571
What am I supposed to do now?

26:14.740 --> 26:15.739
- You run, Wally.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.135
You run where they
can never find you.

26:19.371 --> 26:21.106
- Okay, but if you do that,

26:21.175 --> 26:23.042
Van's just going to make
your mom pay for them.

26:23.111 --> 26:24.714
- No, no way.

26:24.783 --> 26:26.716
I'm getting those knives back.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.620
- Okay, he's going to
go get them, he's set.

26:30.723 --> 26:31.347
How?

26:34.991 --> 26:36.990
- I need to borrow someone's
peanut butter spreader.

27:03.382 --> 27:05.084
- I can lead you to
the gates of hell

27:05.153 --> 27:07.757
but I cannot promise
your safe return.

27:07.826 --> 27:10.089
- Thanks for the
confidence boost.

27:10.158 --> 27:11.288
Pass me a paring knife.

27:15.427 --> 27:16.293
Thanks.

27:21.433 --> 27:22.299
Got it.

27:31.278 --> 27:32.277
What are you doing?

27:32.346 --> 27:33.512
I'm just taking my
knives and leaving.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.653
- Never leave a man
alone behind enemy lines.

28:04.212 --> 28:05.749
- Shit, I'm missing the Carver.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.444
- Don't panic, panic
equals suicide.

28:09.547 --> 28:11.689
We will split up
and find your knife.

28:12.825 --> 28:15.121
You go this way,
I'll go that way.

28:31.238 --> 28:32.435
- It's in my room.
- Belle?

28:32.504 --> 28:34.206
- Quick, follow me.

28:38.312 --> 28:39.717
Wait.

28:56.594 --> 28:57.768
what are you doing?

28:58.530 --> 29:01.200
- It's my cello.

29:01.269 --> 29:03.037
I'm lucky he lets
me play it so much.

29:03.106 --> 29:04.907
He said when he grew
up, girls my age

29:04.976 --> 29:06.876
were never allowed
to play at night,

29:06.945 --> 29:09.571
but it doesn't bother him.

29:09.640 --> 29:10.572
- That's great.

29:10.641 --> 29:12.343
Do you have the knife?

29:12.412 --> 29:15.478
- Yeah, but first, can
I play you my song?

29:15.547 --> 29:18.987
- This isn't the best time,
I really need that knife.

29:19.056 --> 29:20.318
- You should really hear it.

29:20.387 --> 29:22.155
I wrote it for you
after you left.

29:23.423 --> 29:25.895
- If your dad finds me,
he's going to kill me.

29:27.229 --> 29:28.128
I really need to get the knife
and get back to my friends.

29:28.197 --> 29:30.262
- Oh, Daddy won't mind.

29:30.331 --> 29:32.330
He knew you'd be back.

29:32.399 --> 29:33.936
- What are you talking about?

29:39.604 --> 29:41.306
Um, what's going on right now?

29:44.675 --> 29:46.443
Belle, please,
where is the knife?

29:48.547 --> 29:49.746
Stop!

29:49.815 --> 29:50.447
- Don't you know it's
rude to stop the symphony

29:50.516 --> 29:51.548
before the crescendo.

29:51.617 --> 29:55.056
- Symphony, you don't
even have strings.

29:55.125 --> 29:57.289
I think you should come with
me, you're not safe here.

29:57.358 --> 29:59.962
- Daddy says this is the
only place that I'm safe.

30:01.098 --> 30:03.933
- I'm sure he has your
best interests at heart.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.528
I'm going to leave now, though.

30:05.597 --> 30:08.168
Please, Belle,
give me the knife.

30:13.143 --> 30:14.476
- That's weird,

30:14.544 --> 30:17.012
I put it right under my pillow,
but it's not there anymore.

30:17.081 --> 30:18.816
- Okay, screw the
knife, I'm out.

30:19.479 --> 30:20.950
- Wait.

30:40.236 --> 30:41.839
- Please, please be copper.

30:50.708 --> 30:52.509
Son of a bitch, fuck.

30:54.448 --> 30:56.348
- Now you can stay here with me.

30:56.417 --> 30:58.383
- No, neither of us
are staying here.

30:58.452 --> 30:59.217
I'm going to try the
window in the hall.

30:59.286 --> 31:01.023
- Oh, now we can be together,

31:01.092 --> 31:03.289
just like I always imagined.

31:03.358 --> 31:04.587
- What are you talking about?

31:04.656 --> 31:06.358
- I knew you'd come one day.

31:07.461 --> 31:09.394
I've been waiting
for you, my prince.

31:24.643 --> 31:27.247
- Wally, Wally, we need to go.

31:40.098 --> 31:43.362
- So, are you in one of those
all-girl Catholic schools?

31:43.431 --> 31:45.595
- Oh, I don't go to school.

31:45.664 --> 31:46.730
- Why not?

31:46.798 --> 31:49.500
- Daddy says school
isn't for smart people.

31:49.569 --> 31:51.238
- Have you ever been outside?

31:52.407 --> 31:54.604
- Not since we
moved to this house.

31:54.673 --> 31:55.506
- Why not?

31:56.909 --> 32:00.313
- Well, I used to run away a
lot back at the other house.

32:00.382 --> 32:03.151
Daddy got super angry
when Brenda died.

32:04.584 --> 32:07.155
- I'm sorry to hear
about your mom.

32:09.193 --> 32:11.159
My dad died recently, too.

32:12.592 --> 32:13.656
- Lucky.

32:13.725 --> 32:15.262
- What?

32:18.796 --> 32:20.432
- That was my first kiss.

32:20.501 --> 32:22.599
- Um, mine too.

32:23.504 --> 32:25.635
- Should we maybe try again?

32:27.475 --> 32:28.605
- Sounds good to me.

32:34.449 --> 32:36.580
- You salesmen really don't
know when to quit, do you?

32:36.649 --> 32:37.581
- Shit.
- Daddy.

32:39.751 --> 32:42.058
- Looking for this, huh?

32:42.127 --> 32:43.326
- Please, please don't kill me.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.457
- Daddy, come on, please,
please, please, Daddy.

32:45.526 --> 32:46.557
- Belle, stop!

32:46.626 --> 32:47.624
Oh, shit.

32:49.332 --> 32:50.165
- Is that real?

32:51.400 --> 32:53.135
- Belle, no!

32:53.204 --> 32:55.973
- Jed, Jed, come on, come on!

32:59.540 --> 33:01.176
- Jed, you run and get help!

33:20.165 --> 33:22.395
Hey, how do you know
that this is where he lives?

33:22.464 --> 33:24.199
- It's listed in the
company directory.

33:24.268 --> 33:25.300
- Yeah, but people don't put

33:25.369 --> 33:27.664
their real information
on those things.

33:27.733 --> 33:30.271
- It is amazing you
graduated from high school.

33:31.902 --> 33:32.768
- I know.

33:34.171 --> 33:35.270
Wait, wait, wait, he's probably
like banging 10 supermodels,

33:35.339 --> 33:37.509
maybe we should just
send him a text first.

33:37.578 --> 33:38.710
- I don't care who he's banging.

33:38.779 --> 33:41.513
We need his help and we
can't go to the police.

33:41.582 --> 33:45.286
- Shit, okay, yeah.

33:48.391 --> 33:50.159
I just really don't want
to be a cockblock, like,

33:50.228 --> 33:51.127
I don't want to do that to him.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.227
- Jed, Stop talking.

33:56.564 --> 33:57.163
- Guys.

33:57.231 --> 33:58.563
- Sorry about this.

33:59.699 --> 34:00.598
- You know, I really
don't appreciate you

34:00.667 --> 34:02.765
coming by unannounced
to my home.

34:02.834 --> 34:03.966
You know, we should really talk

34:04.035 --> 34:05.101
about boundaries because
I don't think it's good

34:05.170 --> 34:06.235
that you guys are just
knocking on doors--

34:06.304 --> 34:08.639
- Van, we don't have
time for this right now.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.180
- There's a dead
girl and she's dead.

34:11.249 --> 34:12.445
- She might not be dead.

34:12.514 --> 34:13.680
- Who's dead, who's she?

34:13.749 --> 34:15.481
- She flew out of the
window, she hit a gargoyle,

34:15.550 --> 34:16.779
and she wasn't moving--

34:16.848 --> 34:18.253
- Honey.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.621
What is going on?

34:19.690 --> 34:22.158
- You guys like hang out in
robes and wing man each other

34:22.227 --> 34:23.522
with all these
models or something?

34:23.591 --> 34:24.623
- Ignore the idiot.

34:24.692 --> 34:26.591
Please just get dressed
and come with us.

34:27.529 --> 34:29.759
- You see this, this is what I,

34:32.600 --> 34:34.632
- Can you guys
give me one minute?

34:34.701 --> 34:35.733
- Are all the models,
like, upstairs?

34:35.802 --> 34:36.834
- Just a minute.
- There are no models.

34:36.903 --> 34:39.703
- What do you mean
there are no models.

34:39.772 --> 34:40.537
- You are not going
anywhere right now.

34:40.606 --> 34:42.310
Blue tie, pink pocket square.

34:42.379 --> 34:44.213
- One of my kid needs me.

34:44.876 --> 34:46.149
Wingtips or boots?

34:46.218 --> 34:48.250
- Well what about our kids, huh?

34:48.319 --> 34:49.911
And please, no argyle.

34:49.980 --> 34:51.550
- These are our kids.

34:51.619 --> 34:54.289
- That is exactly the point.

34:54.358 --> 34:56.423
Tie, definitely tie.

34:56.492 --> 34:58.722
- Why don't we schedule a
time to talk about this?

34:58.791 --> 35:01.230
- I am not one of
your customers.

35:02.729 --> 35:04.233
You look so good right now.

35:05.633 --> 35:08.435
Still, you are not
going to leave at 10 PM

35:08.504 --> 35:09.700
on our date night.

35:09.769 --> 35:10.635
It's like,

35:12.475 --> 35:13.374
I hate this tie.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.218
- Goodnight, moonlight.

35:24.883 --> 35:26.552
- You're gonna need this.

35:32.924 --> 35:34.395
- DVR Cake Boss?

36:02.690 --> 36:04.161
- No, Belle, no.

36:05.924 --> 36:06.790
No.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.209
Oh, Belle.

37:10.659 --> 37:11.858
- Why aren't we
going to the cops?

37:11.927 --> 37:13.824
- Because technically
Wally and Buddy broke in.

37:13.893 --> 37:15.562
- Whoa, what do you
mean technically?

37:15.631 --> 37:18.026
- Like they literally
broke back in.

37:18.095 --> 37:20.699
- Okay, so why didn't
you just say that?

37:20.768 --> 37:23.240
- I mean technically,
yeah, she kind of did.

37:26.444 --> 37:27.574
- Millennials.

37:47.058 --> 37:48.265
- Now what?

38:16.428 --> 38:17.987
- What are you waiting for?

38:18.056 --> 38:19.022
- Are you sure you want
to go in there, like,

38:19.090 --> 38:21.023
this could be a
really dangerous.

38:21.092 --> 38:22.596
- My plan, my rules.

38:23.966 --> 38:26.930
- Can I tell you something
first, though, before we go in?

38:26.999 --> 38:27.598
- Now?

38:27.666 --> 38:28.699
We don't have time.

38:28.767 --> 38:30.802
- Sarah broke up with
me because of you.

38:32.609 --> 38:34.069
- What are you talking about?
We're not even friends.

38:34.138 --> 38:37.039
- When we were partners
in that biology thing,

38:37.108 --> 38:40.009
I was talking about you all
the time, she got super jelly.

38:41.178 --> 38:42.616
- What are yoU doing?

38:42.685 --> 38:43.484
- I don't know.

38:43.553 --> 38:44.485
- We'll talk about this later.

38:46.051 --> 38:47.522
- Oh wait, this is
going to fall out,

38:47.591 --> 38:49.150
it's going to be
like .

38:49.219 --> 38:52.527
We'll just put it here,
okay, one, two, three.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.797
- Doing some cleaning
around the house?

38:58.866 --> 39:00.799
- Yeah, sorry about the noise.

39:00.868 --> 39:02.537
- Oh, no need to apologize, sir.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.473
In fact, I'm here
to apologize to you.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.772
- A little late in the
evening for that, isn't it?

39:08.139 --> 39:09.907
- You know, I have a pretty
bizarre question for you.

39:09.976 --> 39:13.548
I'm actually looking for
my associate, Wally Banks.

39:13.617 --> 39:15.484
He's not here, is he?

39:16.950 --> 39:18.487
- Name doesn't ring a bell.

39:19.923 --> 39:22.590
- I could've sworn he said he
was going to come around here.

39:23.990 --> 39:25.824
- No trespassing
sign right there,

39:25.893 --> 39:29.564
those Knifecorp kids know
not to come to my house.

39:29.633 --> 39:32.567
- Knifecorp, now how'd you
know he's with Knifecorp?

39:32.636 --> 39:34.932
I don't remember mentioning
anything about that.

39:36.706 --> 39:38.507
- Your plaque right
there, dumbass.

39:40.006 --> 39:41.576
- You are quite the detective.

39:41.645 --> 39:42.444
- Former.

39:42.513 --> 39:45.206
- Former detective, of course.

39:45.275 --> 39:48.176
Well, seeing as how you didn't
get a proper demonstration,

39:48.245 --> 39:49.511
would you mind if I came
inside, maybe showed you--

39:49.580 --> 39:52.653
- It's really not a good
time and I am not interested

39:52.722 --> 39:53.921
in buying any knives.

39:53.990 --> 39:56.690
- Well, I'm not interested
in selling any knives.

39:56.759 --> 39:58.989
I'm here to help you invest
in your family's future.

39:59.058 --> 40:00.793
- Get the fuck off my property.

40:01.929 --> 40:02.795
- Now, Mr. Finn.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.129
Did something happen to
your upstairs window?

40:07.198 --> 40:08.999
- Yeah, God damn
neighborhood kids.

40:10.168 --> 40:11.501
- Are you sure that
wasn't one of mine?

40:11.569 --> 40:13.608
You see, I would just feel so
bad if one of my team members

40:13.677 --> 40:15.742
damaged your home,
they are teenagers,

40:15.811 --> 40:19.108
they can get rambunctious,
especially that Wally Banks.

40:19.177 --> 40:20.417
- It was Van, right?

40:21.113 --> 40:23.046
- I never told you my name.

40:23.115 --> 40:23.880
- You know, I think I will take

40:23.949 --> 40:25.917
that demonstration after all.

40:25.986 --> 40:26.852
Come on in.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.927
- I was a three-time Akiva
Friend sales award winner.

41:08.996 --> 41:10.027
I know quality.

41:11.096 --> 41:12.997
And you seem like a
quality guy, right?

41:15.871 --> 41:20.543
Well, like you and like me,
Knifecorp defines quality.

41:30.919 --> 41:31.851
- Wally, Wally.

41:32.987 --> 41:35.052
- Now when I hold up
this Potato Carver Plus,

41:35.121 --> 41:36.889
what is the first thing you see?

41:38.190 --> 41:39.056
- May I?

41:42.194 --> 41:44.798
- Careful with her,
she's a lot of knife.

41:44.867 --> 41:47.603
- Wally, Wally, wake up, Wally.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.099
- What was that?

41:54.712 --> 41:55.578
- Get your Dicer Pro.

41:55.647 --> 41:56.711
- Okay, okay.

41:57.913 --> 41:59.109
Easy, easy.

41:59.178 --> 42:00.550
- Cut on three,

42:01.279 --> 42:03.311
two, one.
- Two, one.

42:05.382 --> 42:08.283
Okay, okay, one more,
one more, one more.

42:08.352 --> 42:10.351
Two, one.
- Two, one.

42:16.030 --> 42:16.896
- Shit.

42:18.329 --> 42:19.195
Banks!

42:21.431 --> 42:23.199
- Buddy, thank you,
thank you so much.

42:23.268 --> 42:24.400
I owe you my life.

42:24.469 --> 42:26.906
- Just promise to live
for those that cannot.

42:26.975 --> 42:28.072
- Yes, yes, I promise.

42:29.945 --> 42:33.341
- We need to regroup,
formulate a new plan.

42:33.410 --> 42:34.881
- I think we need
to go to the police.

42:34.950 --> 42:36.047
- No, no cops.

42:36.116 --> 42:37.015
I cannot risk it.

42:39.757 --> 42:41.118
- Looks like Tanya and Jed left.

42:41.187 --> 42:42.889
I think we should
see where they are.

42:45.026 --> 42:46.629
- I have no bars.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.191
- That's okay, I can still text.

43:09.952 --> 43:11.753
Oh, that
cannot be good.

43:13.186 --> 43:15.350
- They're inside the house.
We need to go back in there.

43:15.419 --> 43:18.188
- No, that would
surely be suicide.

43:18.257 --> 43:19.423
- Didn't you once say
the only difference

43:19.492 --> 43:22.797
between suicide and
martyrdom is press coverage.

43:22.866 --> 43:25.162
- No, that was
Panic! at the Disco.

43:25.231 --> 43:26.603
Very underrated album.

43:28.135 --> 43:28.934
- Oh, you're right.

43:29.003 --> 43:31.234
- Yes, but we have no plan now

43:31.303 --> 43:32.675
and I need more knives.

43:33.978 --> 43:36.272
- I think I know where we
can get some. Follow me.

44:16.986 --> 44:17.852
- Van.

44:22.387 --> 44:23.319
Fuck, dude.

44:27.227 --> 44:28.456
- Jed.
- This is bad,

44:28.525 --> 44:30.733
this is really, this
is for sure bad.

44:30.802 --> 44:31.668
- Is he dead?

44:33.068 --> 44:34.066
- Yes, yes.

44:37.369 --> 44:38.400
- Are you serious?

44:38.469 --> 44:40.336
- It's the deluxe set.

44:41.472 --> 44:42.338
Do you want me to
just leave this?

44:42.406 --> 44:44.945
Don't worry, hide, hide.
- Shit.

45:03.901 --> 45:04.899
- Oh my God.

45:09.071 --> 45:10.399
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

45:11.403 --> 45:12.940
Fuck.

45:13.009 --> 45:14.744
I'm so sorry, Belle.

45:18.982 --> 45:19.848
Fuck.

46:27.017 --> 46:27.949
Yes, yes, yes.

46:32.088 --> 46:35.517
Oh God, Van, Van,
Van, I'm so sorry.

46:41.163 --> 46:44.867
Ah, yes.

46:44.936 --> 46:46.363
Come on.

46:52.306 --> 46:53.271
This is Raj Appel.

46:53.340 --> 46:54.639
- Daddy, Daddy, it's Tanya.

46:54.708 --> 46:56.978
Tanya, why are you
calling me from this number?

46:57.047 --> 46:59.409
- Because you never answer when
I call and I need your help,

46:59.478 --> 47:00.777
I'm trapped in one of
the houses that I--

47:00.846 --> 47:03.083
Hey Tanya, look, I'm
in the middle of something,

47:03.152 --> 47:04.480
.

47:04.549 --> 47:05.888
- No.

47:05.957 --> 47:07.351
Fuck!

47:07.420 --> 47:08.286
Fuck!

47:50.364 --> 47:51.967
- Hey, we're in here.

47:52.036 --> 47:54.365
Hello, help, help, help!

47:54.434 --> 47:58.039
Yo, this guy's doing crazy
horror movie shit in here!

47:58.108 --> 48:01.141
- Hey, now we are not
doing any of that.

48:01.210 --> 48:02.276
- Nuh uh, nuh uh.

48:02.344 --> 48:03.610
- Now, I need to know
who your friends are

48:03.679 --> 48:07.279
and what they may have said
about our little encounter.

48:08.613 --> 48:09.479
- Honestly, I don't know
what you're talking about.

48:09.548 --> 48:10.953
It's just me.

48:11.022 --> 48:12.614
I'm--
- Shut your mouth.

48:13.552 --> 48:15.155
You're going to wake the dead.

48:18.194 --> 48:20.655
Let's start with an
easier question, shall we?

48:20.724 --> 48:22.998
Where is Wally Banks?

48:23.067 --> 48:25.066
- Do you have anything
easier than that?

48:28.534 --> 48:29.598
Where's Van?

48:30.901 --> 48:33.305
- He's supposed to be out
rescuing you two right now.

48:33.374 --> 48:35.109
- Oh no, that mean
he's at the house.

48:35.178 --> 48:35.943
- Are you,

48:36.012 --> 48:37.011
- Okay, we need to move fast.

48:37.080 --> 48:38.379
Where do you keep
your extra demo kits?

48:38.448 --> 48:41.346
- Extra demo kits, does it
say Costco on our front door?

48:41.415 --> 48:44.184
- Uh, no, just ironic
no solicitors sign.

48:45.584 --> 48:47.022
- We need to arm up.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.354
- I'll go get the riot gear.

49:17.517 --> 49:19.021
- Let's go get this fucker.

49:42.212 --> 49:43.478
- What are you doing?

49:43.547 --> 49:45.113
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what are you doing,

49:45.182 --> 49:46.148
what are you doing with that?

49:46.216 --> 49:48.149
- I need you to
unlock it for me.

49:48.218 --> 49:51.251
- No, no, that's some violation
of privacy laws, dude.

49:51.320 --> 49:53.451
There's laws, okay, all right.

49:53.520 --> 49:55.816
Yeah, it's one, one,
one, one, one, one.

49:55.885 --> 49:57.151
- Where's your friend's name?

49:57.220 --> 50:00.458
- I told you, I don't have
any friends, I work alone.

50:00.527 --> 50:03.263
I'm like a lone Wolf,
here on my own accord.

50:03.332 --> 50:05.364
- That little fucker
with the curly hair.

50:06.401 --> 50:07.634
- Yeah, he's in there.

50:07.702 --> 50:09.500
He's, if you just go to
that group text right there,

50:09.569 --> 50:11.205
the one with the bunch
of the notifications.

50:11.274 --> 50:12.039
- This one.
- Yeah, click that

50:12.108 --> 50:13.471
and let the names scroll up.

50:14.607 --> 50:16.672
Just click it before
you do other things,

50:16.741 --> 50:18.542
just cli-, just
do, just click it.

50:18.611 --> 50:20.610
- You got one chance.
- I'm trying to help you.

50:20.679 --> 50:22.117
See how you're moving
your thumb, like,

50:22.186 --> 50:24.713
really fast right
now, just click it.

50:24.782 --> 50:25.848
And then it's one of
the top two names,

50:25.916 --> 50:27.749
I don't, we're just
work friends, I forget.

50:27.818 --> 50:29.355
- This ain't "Deal or
No Deal," and I'm not

50:29.424 --> 50:31.555
Howie fucking Mandel.
- Okay.

50:32.691 --> 50:34.360
It's really hard for
me to think right now

50:34.429 --> 50:35.528
because you have me tied up,

50:35.597 --> 50:36.562
it's not a normal
situation that people think

50:36.631 --> 50:39.497
really well in,
just so you know.

50:39.566 --> 50:41.103
Hey,

50:41.172 --> 50:42.500
where are you going
with my phone.

50:42.569 --> 50:44.634
- There's no reception inside.

50:44.703 --> 50:46.240
Besides, are you
really that worried

50:46.309 --> 50:47.670
about your phone right now?

50:47.739 --> 50:48.572
- No.

50:50.181 --> 50:51.443
Kinda, a little bit.

50:52.843 --> 50:54.479
There's some pictures on there.

50:54.548 --> 50:56.778
It's very normal
for someone my age,

50:56.847 --> 50:59.286
I was working out a lot,
and I wanted to document it,

50:59.355 --> 51:00.584
that's it, it's just.

51:02.589 --> 51:04.658
Those were just for
me, if you see those.

51:08.595 --> 51:09.461
Did he answer?

51:11.763 --> 51:13.300
- I need to unlock it again.

51:15.602 --> 51:16.468
- Seriously?

51:17.804 --> 51:19.372
Yeah, it's one, one, one,
it's just a bunch of ones.

51:19.441 --> 51:21.209
Sometimes I forget,
people forget,

51:22.444 --> 51:23.607
it's a forgettable thing.

51:24.710 --> 51:25.676
- All right, I got it.

51:25.744 --> 51:28.216
- Okay, it's just,
yeah, four ones.

51:28.285 --> 51:29.580
- What is that?
- Don't,

51:30.485 --> 51:33.683
that's, that's part of me.

51:33.752 --> 51:35.619
- I've never seen that angle.
- Don't look at it.

51:35.688 --> 51:37.885
- You make me sick.
- Okay, okay,

51:37.954 --> 51:39.656
I'm the freak.
- Disgusting.

51:39.725 --> 51:41.361
- Yeah, I'm the disgusting one.

51:42.497 --> 51:45.134
Yeah, I'm the weird
one, yeah, okay, cool.

52:02.649 --> 52:04.318
- Jed.
- Untie me quick.

52:04.387 --> 52:07.453
He's gonna be back
like any second.

52:07.522 --> 52:08.688
We just gotta, we're gonna,

52:08.757 --> 52:09.489
I'm gonna get us out there,
but we just gotta get

52:09.557 --> 52:10.289
my phone first.
- Okay.

52:10.358 --> 52:12.326
- Got some things on there.

52:15.431 --> 52:16.163
- Jed.
- Yeah.

52:16.232 --> 52:17.529
- Can I tell you something?

52:17.598 --> 52:18.330
- Right now?
- Yes.

52:18.399 --> 52:19.631
- Okay.
- I really liked

52:19.700 --> 52:21.500
working with you, in a
group you're kind of a dick,

52:21.569 --> 52:24.734
but one on one,
you're pretty dope.

52:24.803 --> 52:26.373
- I know, yeah,
I'm bad at groups,

52:26.442 --> 52:27.671
I just get overwhelmed.

52:28.741 --> 52:31.774
Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.

52:31.843 --> 52:35.283
Please, Lord, just
help me today.

52:35.352 --> 52:37.351
Today's the day I
need your help, Lord.

52:37.420 --> 52:38.653
- Who were you talking to?

52:38.721 --> 52:41.223
- Just, I was just actually
taking the time to pray,

52:41.292 --> 52:43.258
you know, I hadn't
done it today.

52:43.327 --> 52:46.261
Usually try and do one
a day, and I thought,

52:46.330 --> 52:47.592
when's a better time.

52:47.661 --> 52:49.759
- My house is a dead zone,

52:49.828 --> 52:51.827
even God can't hear
you in here .

52:53.403 --> 52:57.272
- So then I guess He
probably wouldn't be able

52:57.341 --> 52:59.439
to hear you either then either.

52:59.508 --> 53:00.605
- What?
- Right?

53:21.596 --> 53:23.529
- Get up, get up.

53:23.598 --> 53:25.597
- What's wrong with you?

53:29.703 --> 53:31.537
Is that all you got,
you little bitch?

53:31.606 --> 53:32.670
Fuck your phone.

53:38.613 --> 53:40.546
Jed, Jed.

53:40.615 --> 53:41.347
Okay, we have to
go, we have to go.

53:41.416 --> 53:42.746
The door's locked.

53:42.815 --> 53:44.352
We got to find a key.

53:44.421 --> 53:45.487
- Okay, okay, now, now.

53:45.555 --> 53:46.788
- Yeah, yeah, I just
gotta grab the phone

53:46.857 --> 53:49.357
and we're out the door.
- Jed, go.

53:49.426 --> 53:50.424
Jed!

54:30.764 --> 54:32.367
- Belle.

54:32.436 --> 54:34.336
Belle,

54:34.405 --> 54:35.964
I thought you were dead.

54:36.033 --> 54:39.902
- Belle, what are you talking
about, you killed him.

54:39.971 --> 54:41.541
- I thought I lost you.

54:46.714 --> 54:48.944
Come on, let's go
upstairs, I'll protect you.

54:50.179 --> 54:51.452
- No, please.

54:53.655 --> 54:54.785
Stop, please don't
hurt me, please don't,

54:54.854 --> 54:55.786
you're hurting me.

55:04.534 --> 55:07.501
- Your clothes are filthy,
let's put on your nightgown.

55:07.570 --> 55:10.735
- Nightgown, who am
I, Rue McClanahan?

55:10.804 --> 55:12.671
- I don't want to
argue with you.

55:20.451 --> 55:21.911
Argh, not that one.

55:29.460 --> 55:30.326
No.

55:38.469 --> 55:39.665
Ah, there it is.

55:43.133 --> 55:44.967
- Are you just going
to stand there?

55:46.873 --> 55:48.740
- I will always be here for you

55:50.514 --> 55:52.480
and you know I'd
never hurt you, right?

56:04.154 --> 56:05.427
Right?
- Right.

56:25.615 --> 56:27.141
- Good girl.

56:27.210 --> 56:30.386
You are growing into a
very beautiful woman.

56:42.258 --> 56:43.993
It's just you and me now.

56:44.062 --> 56:45.698
- What do you want from me?

56:45.767 --> 56:48.030
- I want us to move forward.

56:48.099 --> 56:49.966
I never should have blamed
you for hurting mom,

56:50.035 --> 56:51.440
but it was my fault.

56:56.778 --> 56:59.008
I knew you weren't
happy and I stayed away.

57:03.785 --> 57:04.717
- It's okay.

57:04.786 --> 57:06.653
- No, it's not.
- It's really okay.

57:06.722 --> 57:10.052
- I know you didn't mean to
hurt her, but she's gone.

57:11.892 --> 57:13.792
She is gone.

57:15.566 --> 57:18.159
And we need to move on.

57:21.132 --> 57:21.864
Do you forgive me?

57:23.233 --> 57:24.572
- It's a little late for that.

57:24.641 --> 57:26.167
- Don't say that.

57:27.776 --> 57:32.778
- No, get off of me!

57:33.683 --> 57:35.583
- Oh, Belle, Belle, Belle.

57:44.628 --> 57:46.660
Oh, thank God, you're okay.

57:46.729 --> 57:47.826
I thought I lost you.

58:02.107 --> 58:03.173
He keeps the
whole house locked up,

58:03.241 --> 58:05.074
so we're going to have
to figure a way in.

58:05.143 --> 58:06.911
- Or maybe there's a
chimney, or a vent,

58:06.980 --> 58:08.550
or there's something
we can crawl through.

58:08.619 --> 58:10.178
- If yoU think that I'm
going down a chimney

58:10.247 --> 58:12.213
in my Louis Vuittons you
are out of your mind.

58:12.282 --> 58:13.984
- This may not be the
best time to tell you,

58:14.053 --> 58:16.217
given the circumstances,
but those are not

58:16.286 --> 58:17.955
real Louis Vuittons.

58:18.024 --> 58:20.595
- How dare you, you TJ
Maxx-wearing little shit.

58:20.664 --> 58:21.695
What gives you the
right to determine

58:21.764 --> 58:23.030
the authenticity of my shoes?

58:23.099 --> 58:25.633
- When you are born in the
dark bowels of a sweatshop,

58:25.702 --> 58:27.162
you notice certain things.

58:27.231 --> 58:28.735
I've seen your soul.

58:28.804 --> 58:30.605
- Forget about
the fucking shoes.

58:30.674 --> 58:32.970
We need to figure
out how to get in.

58:33.039 --> 58:34.774
- Divide and conquer.

58:38.847 --> 58:39.612
- What does that mean?

58:39.681 --> 58:40.549
- No one knows what that is.

58:42.917 --> 58:44.047
- Oh my God, Van.

58:46.052 --> 58:47.182
- God damn it.

59:44.275 --> 59:45.977
- I miss you, babe.

59:49.379 --> 59:52.082
It's not easy without you here.

59:55.792 --> 59:56.790
God damn it.

1:00:15.273 --> 1:00:16.678
- You got this.

1:00:29.023 --> 1:00:32.287
. Wally, is that you?
- It's me.

1:00:32.356 --> 1:00:34.190
- Oh my God, Wally,
stop climbing,

1:00:34.259 --> 1:00:35.829
he's coming, I'll be right back.

1:00:35.898 --> 1:00:37.325
What?

1:00:43.334 --> 1:00:46.103
- Sweetie, I have
dinner for you.

1:00:47.811 --> 1:00:49.843
- Thanks, but I don't eat meat.

1:00:49.912 --> 1:00:51.306
- You love daddy's roast.

1:00:52.178 --> 1:00:53.176
Just give it a try.

1:00:54.785 --> 1:00:56.685
- I'm really not hungry, mister.

1:01:02.925 --> 1:01:04.055
- Call me daddy.

1:01:04.124 --> 1:01:04.990
- You're not my,

1:01:07.831 --> 1:01:11.161
Can I ask you something?
- Anything, sweetie.

1:01:11.230 --> 1:01:14.362
- If you love me so much,
why are you locking me up.

1:01:14.431 --> 1:01:16.738
- Just eat.
- What's up with that, Dad?

1:01:16.807 --> 1:01:19.136
You said I could ask, you're
such a hypocrite, Dad.

1:01:19.205 --> 1:01:20.434
- Stop.
- Honestly, you're so full

1:01:20.503 --> 1:01:23.305
of shit, Dad.
- Watch your mouth.

1:01:24.475 --> 1:01:25.608
You want an answer,
you want to know why?

1:01:27.543 --> 1:01:30.048
Because I thought I was
going to lose you for good,

1:01:30.117 --> 1:01:32.083
so I kept you to myself.

1:01:33.450 --> 1:01:35.823
I know you're a kid and
you don't think like that.

1:01:37.058 --> 1:01:40.091
But your mom and I tried
so hard to get you.

1:01:41.425 --> 1:01:45.096
I know I wasn't always there
for you, but I'm here now.

1:01:50.973 --> 1:01:52.268
It's time to play our song.

1:01:58.178 --> 1:02:03.114
- Van, baby, I'm coming
for you in just one second.

1:02:08.254 --> 1:02:09.989
911,
what's your emergency?

1:02:10.058 --> 1:02:11.892
- Oh, thank God.

1:02:11.961 --> 1:02:15.390
My boyfriend is stuck in
this house with his kids,

1:02:15.459 --> 1:02:18.327
I mean his employees.

1:02:19.496 --> 1:02:21.528
Whose
kids are they, sir?

1:02:21.597 --> 1:02:23.464
- Oh my God, that is a
whole other discussion.

1:02:23.533 --> 1:02:27.072
The address is
822 Willow Street.

1:02:27.141 --> 1:02:28.777
Hold on, please.

1:02:31.046 --> 1:02:32.341
I'm sorry, sir, we
already spoke before

1:02:32.410 --> 1:02:34.442
and Detective Channing
got the all clear.

1:02:35.413 --> 1:02:37.115
- So you're not going to come?

1:02:37.184 --> 1:02:38.919
Nuh uh,
there's nothing we can do,

1:02:38.988 --> 1:02:40.316
maybe try neighborhood watch.

1:02:41.353 --> 1:02:44.353
- What the fuck,
oh my G-, hello?

1:02:52.100 --> 1:02:56.530
Okay, I don't need that, Van,
I'm gonna save you today.

1:02:58.535 --> 1:03:00.402
There are
no strings on it.

1:03:01.472 --> 1:03:03.944
- You don't need
strings to play music.

1:03:07.544 --> 1:03:09.213
- Why are you so creepy?

1:03:16.322 --> 1:03:17.188
- Please begin.

1:03:33.339 --> 1:03:34.371
- What do you want me to do?

1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:36.944
- I want you to play
like you always do.

1:03:39.081 --> 1:03:43.852
Oh, oh, oh my
God, I'm like Black Panther.

1:03:44.713 --> 1:03:45.579
What the fuck?

1:03:48.156 --> 1:03:53.158
Oh my Louis's, oh,
they're okay

1:03:54.492 --> 1:03:55.963
Okay.

1:03:56.032 --> 1:03:56.898
Oh, okay.

1:03:58.298 --> 1:03:59.461
Ooh, all right.

1:04:10.376 --> 1:04:12.606
What the f-, I am not,

1:04:12.675 --> 1:04:16.016
I am not fucKing
stuck, no, oh my God.

1:04:28.625 --> 1:04:30.096
- Not like that.

1:04:52.187 --> 1:04:53.482
Sounds like we have company.

1:04:53.551 --> 1:04:54.615
Excuse me, sweetheart.

1:04:57.357 --> 1:04:58.652
Of course, Daddy.

1:05:06.069 --> 1:05:07.232
Wally.
- Are you okay?

1:05:07.301 --> 1:05:08.970
- He just left,
get me out of here.

1:05:09.039 --> 1:05:10.400
- Move away from the wood.

1:05:10.469 --> 1:05:11.335
- What?

1:05:17.242 --> 1:05:18.307
Be careful.

1:05:18.376 --> 1:05:21.510
Wally, is
that you, Wally Banks.

1:05:21.579 --> 1:05:24.084
- I'm only looking for
Van, please, I'm so sorry.

1:05:24.153 --> 1:05:26.185
I just came here to get Van.

1:05:26.254 --> 1:05:27.384
Oh, I'm
sure you're going

1:05:27.453 --> 1:05:30.090
to see him again real soon.

1:05:32.623 --> 1:05:36.426
Oh my God.

1:05:47.209 --> 1:05:50.110
- You haven't lived
'til you've been burned,

1:05:50.179 --> 1:05:52.013
, I should know.

1:06:00.288 --> 1:06:03.024
Honey, you want one
marshmallow or two?

1:06:20.638 --> 1:06:23.506
- Oh my God, oh
my God, oh my God.

1:06:24.411 --> 1:06:25.277
Okay.

1:06:27.513 --> 1:06:28.379
I got you.

1:06:29.779 --> 1:06:31.052
Oh my God, oh my God.

1:06:31.121 --> 1:06:31.987
Oh my God.

1:06:33.783 --> 1:06:34.649
Thank you.

1:06:35.818 --> 1:06:36.684
- Of course.

1:06:41.131 --> 1:06:42.822
Shit.
- What?

1:06:42.891 --> 1:06:44.560
- We can't go back
out the way I came in.

1:06:44.629 --> 1:06:46.199
- So what's the plan?

1:06:46.268 --> 1:06:47.266
- Well, I don't know.

1:06:48.534 --> 1:06:49.829
Where's Jed?

1:06:49.898 --> 1:06:51.732
- He killed them.
- Them?

1:06:51.801 --> 1:06:53.107
- Jed and Van.

1:06:54.144 --> 1:06:57.441
- Shit, this is so fucked up.

1:06:57.510 --> 1:06:59.344
- We need to get Buddy
and get out of here.

1:06:59.413 --> 1:07:00.279
- Buddy?

1:07:25.505 --> 1:07:26.503
- Where's your
friend, Wally Banks?

1:07:26.572 --> 1:07:28.571
- Never heard of him.

1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:30.144
- You think this is a joke?

1:07:55.337 --> 1:07:56.236
Don't move.

1:08:25.532 --> 1:08:26.164
- Did you hear that?

1:08:26.233 --> 1:08:27.267
- Yeah, sounded like,

1:08:32.770 --> 1:08:34.003
- Wait here.

1:08:34.071 --> 1:08:35.440
- Hell no, every time a
dude tells me what to do,

1:08:35.509 --> 1:08:37.310
someone ends up dead.

1:08:37.379 --> 1:08:38.212
- Fine.

1:08:58.829 --> 1:09:00.630
Don't look.

1:09:06.507 --> 1:09:07.736
Shit.

1:09:07.805 --> 1:09:09.474
- All right, here's the plan.

1:09:09.543 --> 1:09:10.308
I'll go get Buddy,
you get the keys.

1:09:10.377 --> 1:09:11.707
- Did you not hear me before?

1:09:11.776 --> 1:09:13.280
He wants you dead, not me.

1:09:13.349 --> 1:09:14.515
So you're not the boss of me,

1:09:14.584 --> 1:09:16.580
I go where I want.
- Tanya, we don't have time.

1:09:16.649 --> 1:09:18.846
- This might be the last thing
either of us have time for.

1:09:18.915 --> 1:09:20.148
- Okay, then fine.

1:09:20.216 --> 1:09:21.282
According to your logic,
you should go get the keys

1:09:21.351 --> 1:09:24.357
because you're safe
with Finn and I'm not.

1:09:24.426 --> 1:09:25.558
Are you happy?

1:09:25.627 --> 1:09:26.293
Now you can tweet about
how much of a chauvinist

1:09:26.361 --> 1:09:27.093
I am we when we get out.

1:09:27.162 --> 1:09:29.197
Now, please go get the key.

1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:30.891
- Argh, fine.

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:31.826
- Jesus Christ.

1:09:45.744 --> 1:09:47.479
- It's got to be around here.

1:09:47.548 --> 1:09:49.349
Please have the keys.

1:09:57.459 --> 1:09:58.325
Yes.

1:10:02.860 --> 1:10:04.529
- Buddy, Buddy.

1:10:04.598 --> 1:10:05.464
Wake up.

1:10:09.603 --> 1:10:10.535
- I have the key, we
need to get out of here

1:10:10.604 --> 1:10:11.570
before Finn wakes up.

1:10:11.638 --> 1:10:12.737
- I'm not leaving
here without Buddy.

1:10:12.806 --> 1:10:15.738
- Wally, I am begging
you, we have to go now.

1:10:17.578 --> 1:10:18.939
Buddy will be okay,
okay, that's his thing,

1:10:19.008 --> 1:10:20.776
he always ends up being okay.

1:10:22.352 --> 1:10:24.945
Look, he's going to kill
you, you know that, right?

1:10:25.014 --> 1:10:27.354
- I don't know, just give
me a second to think.

1:10:29.489 --> 1:10:31.853
Buddy, Buddy, Buddy, it's us.

1:10:31.922 --> 1:10:34.460
You're okay, you're
okay, calm down.

1:10:34.529 --> 1:10:36.264
We're gonna get you out
of here. Don't panic.

1:10:42.933 --> 1:10:43.766
- Wally.

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:47.308
- That's enough for
me to save my house.

1:10:47.377 --> 1:10:50.377
- That's enough for me to
get out of my house for good.

1:10:50.446 --> 1:10:52.445
Where'd
he get all this?

1:10:52.514 --> 1:10:53.809
- Wally, what's going on?

1:10:55.078 --> 1:10:55.677
- I don't know, look,
I'm just going to get you

1:10:55.746 --> 1:10:56.944
out of here, okay.

1:11:02.117 --> 1:11:04.985
- Nickel plated,
no stainless steel.

1:11:05.054 --> 1:11:06.723
- What does that mean?

1:11:06.792 --> 1:11:09.858
- That saw, that
saw can cut through.

1:11:09.927 --> 1:11:11.464
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you insane?

1:11:11.533 --> 1:11:13.059
- No, we have no choice.

1:11:13.128 --> 1:11:14.764
Have you ever used one before?

1:11:14.833 --> 1:11:16.733
- Heck no, I've never
used a saw before.

1:11:16.802 --> 1:11:18.405
- That's okay, I will
talk you through.

1:11:19.134 --> 1:11:21.067
Okay, hurry up.

1:11:21.136 --> 1:11:23.806
- It's okay, you can do it,
I believe in you, Wally.

1:11:39.693 --> 1:11:42.429
Okay, found an outlet.

1:11:42.498 --> 1:11:44.365
Oh, wonderful.

1:11:44.434 --> 1:11:45.630
Okay, it's plugged in.

1:11:45.699 --> 1:11:46.532
- What do I do?

1:11:47.833 --> 1:11:50.096
- The lever on the side.

1:11:50.165 --> 1:11:50.830
- This one?
- Use it

1:11:50.899 --> 1:11:52.307
to release the safety.

1:11:53.102 --> 1:11:54.705
Okay, good, now,

1:11:56.072 --> 1:11:58.973
press the button to
activate on the right.

1:12:01.748 --> 1:12:02.547
- Where's the switch?

1:12:02.616 --> 1:12:04.649
- Right there, on on the right.

1:12:04.718 --> 1:12:05.483
Your other right.

1:12:05.552 --> 1:12:06.651
Okay, sorry, sorry.

1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:11.018
- Okay, now pull the
trigger very carefully

1:12:11.087 --> 1:12:12.954
to activate and turn on.

1:12:17.467 --> 1:12:18.333
- Okay, okay.

1:12:20.063 --> 1:12:20.896
Ready.

1:12:21.867 --> 1:12:22.733
Very slowly.

1:12:24.606 --> 1:12:27.166
Three, two.

1:12:27.235 --> 1:12:28.167
- Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1:12:28.236 --> 1:12:29.202
- Maybe you practice
on something

1:12:29.270 --> 1:12:31.676
for they can be
tricky sometimes.

1:12:31.745 --> 1:12:34.107
That's a good
idea, that's a good idea.

1:12:50.027 --> 1:12:51.093
- I did it.
- That was amazing.

1:12:51.161 --> 1:12:53.566
- Oh my God, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

1:12:53.635 --> 1:12:55.029
- Hey, wait, you
forgot about me.

1:12:55.098 --> 1:12:56.767
- Oh sorry.
- Idiot.

1:12:58.739 --> 1:13:00.804
- I have to do this again?

1:13:03.909 --> 1:13:05.644
- One more time, here we go.

1:13:05.713 --> 1:13:08.449
Ready, three, two,

1:13:09.178 --> 1:13:10.110
you can do this.

1:13:10.179 --> 1:13:12.651
Okay, three, two.

1:13:14.018 --> 1:13:14.650
- We should probably put on
goggles or something, right?

1:13:14.719 --> 1:13:15.984
Yes, sure.

1:13:16.053 --> 1:13:17.854
- Oh come on, you're killing me.

1:13:17.923 --> 1:13:20.186
- Here, here, here,
there's only one pair.

1:13:20.255 --> 1:13:21.990
- You put them on and
I'll just close my eyes.

1:13:22.059 --> 1:13:23.530
- Are you fucking stupid?

1:13:24.798 --> 1:13:26.830
- Right, I guess that
doesn't make sense.

1:13:28.967 --> 1:13:29.833
- Three,

1:13:32.069 --> 1:13:33.474
two,

1:13:34.244 --> 1:13:36.037
Wally Banks.

1:13:41.111 --> 1:13:44.111
How does it feel to be
responsible for all this blood?

1:13:44.180 --> 1:13:46.146
- I didn't mean to, I swear.

1:13:46.215 --> 1:13:47.950
- You like being
a killer, Banks?

1:13:49.185 --> 1:13:50.722
- Don't come any closer.

1:13:50.791 --> 1:13:52.889
- You know how this ends, right?

1:13:52.958 --> 1:13:53.824
- I'm serious.

1:13:55.697 --> 1:13:58.191
- Fancy toys just aren't
as much fun without

1:13:59.998 --> 1:14:00.831
power.

1:14:05.641 --> 1:14:07.134
- What the fuck?
- Stay back or she dies.

1:14:07.203 --> 1:14:09.070
Put it
down, don't hurt her.

1:14:10.239 --> 1:14:11.271
- If you want to see her alive,

1:14:11.340 --> 1:14:13.580
stay down here, do
you understand that?

1:14:13.649 --> 1:14:14.515
- Banks.

1:14:15.717 --> 1:14:16.583
Belle!

1:14:21.591 --> 1:14:23.051
- You asshole.
- Ow, why are you hitting me?

1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:25.020
- You can't fucking
do that to me.

1:14:25.089 --> 1:14:26.758
Finn might be a
psycho but he didn't

1:14:26.827 --> 1:14:27.926
put a knife to my
fucking throat.

1:14:27.995 --> 1:14:30.465
- I'm sorry, I was just
trying to protect you.

1:14:31.733 --> 1:14:32.797
Did you get the key?

1:14:32.866 --> 1:14:33.665
- What key?

1:14:33.734 --> 1:14:35.063
- The key to get us out of here.

1:14:37.002 --> 1:14:38.001
- Daddy said it's
not safe out there.

1:14:38.070 --> 1:14:39.870
- Tanya, we don't
have time, let's go.

1:14:54.019 --> 1:14:55.017
- Come here.

1:14:56.626 --> 1:14:57.954
- I told you to stay downstairs.

1:14:58.023 --> 1:14:59.659
- Please, don't.
- Now, I have to do this.

1:14:59.728 --> 1:15:01.320
- No, ah.

1:15:03.127 --> 1:15:04.565
Please, she's all I have.

1:15:04.634 --> 1:15:06.094
Time's up.

1:15:06.163 --> 1:15:07.029
- Let go.

1:15:08.396 --> 1:15:09.028
Let go!

1:15:09.097 --> 1:15:11.165
- Come on, let's go.

1:15:13.874 --> 1:15:15.873
- Ow, what the fuck, Wally?

1:15:15.942 --> 1:15:18.238
- I'm sorry, I really
am, but I had no choice.

1:15:26.788 --> 1:15:28.017
Tanya, what are you doing?

1:15:29.021 --> 1:15:30.316
- I have no choice.

1:15:30.385 --> 1:15:31.889
You said so yourself.

1:15:34.257 --> 1:15:35.728
- Tanya, please,

1:15:35.797 --> 1:15:37.664
just put the knife down, okay.

1:15:39.097 --> 1:15:40.359
We're going to get out of this,

1:15:40.428 --> 1:15:42.130
we just need to work together.

1:15:42.199 --> 1:15:45.232
- Why, so you can cut me again?

1:15:45.301 --> 1:15:46.266
Or threaten me?

1:15:47.669 --> 1:15:50.974
What's the next move in your
brilliant escape plan, Wally?

1:15:51.043 --> 1:15:53.207
Is your plan To
just let me die here

1:15:53.276 --> 1:15:55.308
or use me as bait
because that's no better

1:15:55.377 --> 1:15:56.881
than what he's doing.

1:15:56.950 --> 1:15:59.081
- Are you actually
defending him right now?

1:16:00.151 --> 1:16:01.886
- At least he hasn't hurt me.

1:16:01.955 --> 1:16:04.988
- Shh, just put it down.

1:16:05.057 --> 1:16:06.253
Put it down.

1:16:09.457 --> 1:16:11.192
It's okay, it's okay,

1:16:11.261 --> 1:16:13.260
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay.

1:16:13.329 --> 1:16:14.998
Just stay with me.

1:16:16.233 --> 1:16:17.032
Fuck, shit,

1:16:17.101 --> 1:16:19.167
We need to jump out the window.

1:16:19.236 --> 1:16:20.839
- No, I'm not jumping.

1:16:22.745 --> 1:16:26.845
- Wally, let my daughter
go and I'll let you walk.

1:16:28.377 --> 1:16:29.914
- Let go, you're hurting me.

1:16:32.381 --> 1:16:33.885
- Do you trust me?

1:16:33.954 --> 1:16:34.985
Do you trust me?

1:16:36.253 --> 1:16:37.119
Wally.

1:16:43.425 --> 1:16:45.325
- On the count of three.

1:16:45.394 --> 1:16:46.260
One,

1:16:48.133 --> 1:16:48.999
two,

1:16:50.740 --> 1:16:52.233
You're just
like your father.

1:16:53.468 --> 1:16:55.236
- You don't know
anything about my father.

1:16:56.405 --> 1:16:57.137
- I knew him well
enough to know it was

1:16:57.206 --> 1:16:59.438
his own damn fault he died.

1:16:59.507 --> 1:17:00.806
Same way it is for you.

1:17:00.875 --> 1:17:03.783
- My dad was on patrol, it
could've happened to anyone.

1:17:03.852 --> 1:17:05.213
- Is that what they told you?

1:17:08.054 --> 1:17:08.786
- I know what
you're trying to do

1:17:08.855 --> 1:17:10.350
and it's not going to work.

1:17:12.355 --> 1:17:13.354
- Let me do you one favor

1:17:13.423 --> 1:17:14.827
before you go meet
your father, huh.

1:17:14.896 --> 1:17:15.762
- Shut up.

1:17:16.931 --> 1:17:18.765
- Your dad was already
clocked out of his shift

1:17:18.834 --> 1:17:21.064
when dispatch reported
a disturbance.

1:17:21.133 --> 1:17:23.033
Yeah, he was the
closest patrolman

1:17:23.102 --> 1:17:24.705
but he didn't even
have to be there.

1:17:24.774 --> 1:17:25.937
- You're lying!

1:17:26.006 --> 1:17:27.873
- Those are the facts.

1:17:27.942 --> 1:17:31.646
Just like it's a fact that your
boss is dead because of you.

1:17:33.849 --> 1:17:36.816
But that's not nearly as
tragic as your friend, Buddy.

1:17:38.282 --> 1:17:40.050
And what was that
other kid's name, Ted?

1:17:41.021 --> 1:17:42.187
- Jed, Jed.

1:17:42.256 --> 1:17:44.923
- All their lives cut
short just because of what,

1:17:44.992 --> 1:17:47.123
your crappy little knives.

1:17:47.192 --> 1:17:48.223
- Stop talking!

1:17:52.197 --> 1:17:56.671
- Hey, you are in my house
now, you listen to me.

1:17:59.567 --> 1:18:02.875
You're not a salesman,
Banks, you're a killer.

1:18:02.944 --> 1:18:06.406
Four bodies in one
night, that's not bad.

1:18:06.475 --> 1:18:10.278
All your friends are dead and
the blood is on your hands.

1:18:10.347 --> 1:18:12.786
- I tried to save them.

1:18:12.855 --> 1:18:16.515
Oh, now
you sound like Eddie.

1:18:16.584 --> 1:18:18.352
Eddie is going to
save the world.

1:18:18.421 --> 1:18:19.520
Look where that got him.

1:18:19.589 --> 1:18:20.688
- You have no right to
talk about him that way.

1:18:20.757 --> 1:18:23.764
- And you had no right
to take my daughter.

1:18:23.833 --> 1:18:25.029
- She's not your daughter.

1:18:25.098 --> 1:18:27.163
- She is, she is mine.

1:18:29.839 --> 1:18:31.706
- Stop fucking humming, Tanya.

1:18:33.106 --> 1:18:35.710
- You know what happens to
guys with no spine, Wally?

1:18:37.176 --> 1:18:38.042
- Don't.

1:18:40.850 --> 1:18:42.816
- I said, do you know
what happens to guys

1:18:42.885 --> 1:18:45.346
with no spine, Wally?

1:18:47.516 --> 1:18:49.449
They get killed by
little punk asses

1:18:49.518 --> 1:18:51.352
with pistols, that's what.

1:18:51.421 --> 1:18:52.518
- Tanya, jump!

1:18:52.587 --> 1:18:54.223
- That's not my name.

1:18:54.292 --> 1:18:54.924
- What?

1:18:54.993 --> 1:18:55.591
- That's not my name.

1:18:55.660 --> 1:18:56.659
That's not my name.

1:18:56.728 --> 1:18:58.557
- Tanya, what are
you talking about?

1:18:58.626 --> 1:19:00.394
- That's not my name!

1:19:22.155 --> 1:19:23.483
- This all ends tonight.

1:19:23.552 --> 1:19:24.384
Murderer!

1:19:27.292 --> 1:19:30.963
- According to my tally, your
hands are more red than mine.

1:19:31.032 --> 1:19:33.064
- They're about to
get a lot more red.

1:19:36.433 --> 1:19:38.366
- You had to fucking knock.

1:19:38.435 --> 1:19:41.336
You had to interrupt a calm
night with me and my daughter.

1:19:47.180 --> 1:19:48.981
- Belle's dead because of you.

1:19:49.050 --> 1:19:51.819
- Don't talk about my
family, you piece of shit.

1:19:55.584 --> 1:19:56.923
Apologize.

1:19:59.654 --> 1:20:01.125
- Daddy.
- Belle.

1:20:22.644 --> 1:20:23.510
- Checkmate.

1:20:25.515 --> 1:20:27.954
- So how do you see
this playing out?

1:20:28.023 --> 1:20:30.154
You kill me and then what?

1:20:30.223 --> 1:20:32.926
Cops come in and find your
treasure trove of bodies.

1:20:34.260 --> 1:20:36.523
I was a cop, Wally, they'll
fucking hang you for this.

1:20:36.592 --> 1:20:37.832
- It's over.

1:20:38.901 --> 1:20:41.165
- You don't want to
kill anybody else.

1:20:41.234 --> 1:20:43.365
- I'm taking her
and we're leaving.

1:20:44.468 --> 1:20:45.532
- I don't think so.

1:20:51.574 --> 1:20:53.012
- What's so funny?

1:20:53.081 --> 1:20:54.409
- Your dad,

1:20:54.478 --> 1:20:56.851
if he could see you
right now, he'd be sick.

1:20:58.713 --> 1:20:59.986
But I never had a son.

1:21:01.289 --> 1:21:03.517
And for the first time all
night, I'm proud of ya.

1:21:06.391 --> 1:21:07.257
So do it,

1:21:08.293 --> 1:21:09.392
do what your dad
should have done.

1:21:09.461 --> 1:21:11.426
When he saw that kid
pointing a gun at him.

1:21:11.495 --> 1:21:12.526
- Fuck you.
- Do it.

1:21:19.239 --> 1:21:21.007
- Are you proud
of me, too, Daddy?

1:21:27.478 --> 1:21:30.082
- I'm so sorry, Belle.

1:21:30.151 --> 1:21:31.413
I'm so sorry.

1:21:34.287 --> 1:21:35.351
I love you, sweetie.

1:21:38.654 --> 1:21:40.026
- I love you too, Daddy.

1:21:42.526 --> 1:21:43.656
- We're safe again.

1:23:07.809 --> 1:23:09.742
- I'm here in Glen
Valley, standing in front

1:23:09.811 --> 1:23:12.118
of former detective
Angus Finn's home,

1:23:12.187 --> 1:23:14.252
now site to a horrific bloodbath

1:23:14.321 --> 1:23:16.122
that's already trending
on social media

1:23:16.191 --> 1:23:19.257
as the #KnifeCorpMassacre.

1:23:19.326 --> 1:23:20.492
Six bodies have been recovered

1:23:20.561 --> 1:23:23.195
and according to authorities,
suspect Wally Banks

1:23:23.264 --> 1:23:25.197
was found dead at the
scene of the crime.

1:23:25.266 --> 1:23:26.462
Our thoughts and prayers go out

1:23:26.531 --> 1:23:27.764
to the families of the victims.

1:23:27.832 --> 1:23:29.828

1:26:44.993 --> 1:26:48.268
it's a coconut killer

1:26:51.098 --> 1:26:53.933
pennies with scissors

1:26:56.741 --> 1:26:59.774
you better not hurt her

might get murdered
