WEBVTT

00:30.508 --> 00:32.683
Amanda is...

00:32.728 --> 00:35.035
OK.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.232
Hi! What's going on
with the music?

00:58.275 --> 01:00.756
Can't hear yourself think,
let alone write.

01:00.799 --> 01:04.083
- Mom, we're just talking.
- Nobody's talking over that. You guys are supposed to be doing

01:04.107 --> 01:07.110
- your homework.
- Later.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.330
- See you at the concert this weekend.
- Yeah.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.332
- Nope.
- Yes.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.335
I said you're not going
to a concert unsupervised.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.292
Mom, everyone is gonna be there.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.468
My brother's gonna be there.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.949
- It's not happening.
- 'K.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.429
Goodbye, Jessica.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.649
You never let me do anything.

01:24.693 --> 01:27.261
Just because you have no life
doesn't mean the rest of us

01:27.304 --> 01:30.264
- shouldn't have fun.
- I have a life. Just so happens I have a blind date

01:30.307 --> 01:32.135
- tonight.
- Really?

01:32.179 --> 01:34.398
- Mm-hmm.
- You should wear that.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.792
It'll go over really well.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.274
Maybe I will.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.886
Why?

01:58.205 --> 02:00.250
Ladies.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.821
It's been a long time.

02:11.087 --> 02:14.221
Hi, I'm a really big fan.
Can I get your autograph?

02:14.264 --> 02:16.397
Anything for a really big fan.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.358
- There you go.
- Thank you.

02:21.402 --> 02:24.144
Hey! Great news, I got you
booked on the Today Show.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.581
- What? That's fantastic!
- And then I'm gonna need you

02:26.624 --> 02:28.341
for half an hour for
the investors' meeting.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.735
We gotta push it. I gotta work
on the dinner menu, I told you.

02:30.759 --> 02:33.370
The menu's fine, OK?
We need to work on the cookware

02:33.414 --> 02:35.677
and frozen food
and franchising this place.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.941
- Wanna taste it, chef?
- I'm sure it's good. Thanks.

02:38.984 --> 02:40.508
Wow, you're so pushy.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.727
Is that why we didn't work out?

02:42.771 --> 02:45.208
I'm pretty sure it's more
complicated than that. OK,

02:45.252 --> 02:47.384
look, you got 30 minutes.
Right now I gotta change

02:47.428 --> 02:49.386
for this blind date
my sister set me up on.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.649
Doesn't Leslie know you don't
need any blind dates?

02:51.693 --> 02:54.174
Apparently not.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.374
You know what? Can you just...

03:27.032 --> 03:29.426
Oh!

04:00.631 --> 04:03.068
- Hi there. Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

04:03.112 --> 04:06.289
- You look great.
- Yeah, you too. Cheers.

04:06.333 --> 04:10.424
You're Matthew Everston!
I am such a huge fan.
I love this restaurant.

04:10.467 --> 04:14.166
Thank you very much. I heard you were pretty,
but I'd say that is an understatement.

04:14.210 --> 04:16.343
- Ha!
- Who told you that?

04:16.386 --> 04:19.084
- Your sister, my book editor.
- She told me all about you,

04:19.128 --> 04:21.043
how you were
a successful writer.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.566
Was, past tense.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.960
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.049
Sorry to interrupt,
but are you Terry Russell?

04:27.092 --> 04:28.442
Yeah.

04:28.485 --> 04:31.053
I have read everything
you've ever written.

04:31.096 --> 04:33.858
- Oh, thank you! That's so nice!
- I can't wait for the next book to come out.

04:33.882 --> 04:37.451
- When is that happening?
- Uh, soon. Soon-ish.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.627
Good night.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.631
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.852
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:47.896 --> 04:50.159
I'm sorry, I just
didn't notice you there.

04:50.202 --> 04:52.248
Wow, not doing yourself
any favours with that one.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.835
- Let me get us a couple drinks.
- You're living up to your name.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.861
Can I get my usual,
please? Thanks, buddy.

04:56.905 --> 05:00.038
- So, pretty sweet pick-up lines.
- You like those, huh?

05:00.082 --> 05:02.476
Out of curiosity, what happens
if you settle down

05:02.519 --> 05:04.913
with somebody? You gonna be
Chef Cupid forever?

05:04.956 --> 05:07.742
Sure, why not?

05:07.785 --> 05:09.720
- Alright, enjoy your blind date.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.137
Guy Fieri's a loudmouth,
Bourdain's a bad boy,

05:12.181 --> 05:14.420
and I'm the guy that you have
fun with. It's a just a brand.

05:14.444 --> 05:17.360
Can't separate the rice
from the pudding, pal.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.710
I think it's hilarious
you're a romance novelist.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.495
Why's that?

05:21.538 --> 05:24.193
Because you claim to be an expert
on love, yet here you are,

05:24.236 --> 05:26.674
totally single, not even giving
this blind date a chance.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.678
Nice to meet you, Chef Cupid.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.509
Well, that went well.

05:56.399 --> 06:00.055
So tell me more about you.
I really do want to know.

06:00.098 --> 06:02.231
What is Dominic Barone
doing here?

06:02.274 --> 06:04.364
Don't worry about it.
He had the coq au vin.

06:04.407 --> 06:07.149
- Why didn't I know about this?
- I told you last week

06:07.192 --> 06:09.630
while you were being interviewed
for Gourmet Magazine.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.435
- Your hair had amazing...
- I should've been the one that cooked for him.

06:12.459 --> 06:15.244
You were on a date
with Danielle Steel!

06:17.507 --> 06:20.423
- Look, I'm sure you're a nicer...
- Not now.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.644
Mr. Barone!

06:23.687 --> 06:25.733
I wish I had known
you were coming.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.691
Matthew Everston.

06:27.735 --> 06:30.433
Culinary superstar.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.610
Pioneer of the French
gastropub scene.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.265
Is that what you're gonna
write in your review?

06:36.308 --> 06:38.310
To start off with,

06:38.354 --> 06:40.754
followed by the fact that you've
become a parody of yourself.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.228
What do you mean, parody?

06:43.272 --> 06:46.188
You know how much I respect you.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.799
My coq au vin was stale.

06:48.843 --> 06:51.019
Unimaginative.
It was like taking a bite

06:51.062 --> 06:54.326
out of something that
was sitting out all day,

06:54.370 --> 06:56.459
something created
for a photo shoot.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.201
Mr. Barone, you can't
write that. We're about

06:59.244 --> 07:01.595
to sign investors for
franchising and we're launching

07:01.638 --> 07:03.553
a frozen food line.
Come on, gimme a break.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.773
Perhaps that's
the problem, Matthew.

07:05.816 --> 07:09.037
You've become the face
of your food

07:09.080 --> 07:11.126
and you stopped being
the heart of it.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.105
So, is he right?
Am I a sellout?

07:34.149 --> 07:38.458
Don't let Barone get inside your head.
You're a two-time Iron Chef.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.682
- Not anymore.
- People don't read reviews.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.728
It's not gonna change anything.

07:49.730 --> 07:54.256
- When's the investors' meeting?
- They're rescheduling it again.

07:56.388 --> 07:59.174
"Rescheduling."
They're pulling out.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.932
Proof that a guy like Barone
can shut down a restaurant
with one review.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.536
Honey, he's like the biggest
Peter Pan case I've ever met!

08:13.580 --> 08:17.540
He doesn't want the right girl, he
wants just the next girl, you know?

08:17.584 --> 08:20.543
I'm really sorry, I just... He's
actually a really nice person.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.719
I think he just hasn't,
you know, met the right girl.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.332
- That is him calling right now.
- No, don't answer.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.378
- I'm answering.
- Come on. Don't!

08:29.421 --> 08:31.685
I am answering.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.426
- Hey, d'you hear what happened?
- Of course I did.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.951
Psh! It was the worst
night of my life.

08:36.994 --> 08:40.389
- Come on, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.
- Oh no, it was that bad.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.913
As your younger sister,
I need to tell you

08:42.957 --> 08:45.742
that at some point, you're gonna
need to stop hopping

08:45.786 --> 08:48.702
- from lily pad to lily pad.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.532
Wait a minute, what
are we talking about?

08:52.575 --> 08:55.317
- The date with Terry.
- Oh, yeah.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.730
Could you please not set me up
with any of your uptight friends

08:57.754 --> 09:01.279
- anymore?
- I'm not uptight! I'm a good-time girl!

09:01.323 --> 09:04.413
- I'm fun!
- Is she right there? Am I on speakerphone?

09:04.456 --> 09:07.459
- Nope, gotta go!
- Hold on! Wait, I need to talk to you about my res...

09:09.853 --> 09:12.073
My restaurant.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.168
'Cause I'm finished.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.562
- What was that?
- Forget it. Just forget him,

09:22.605 --> 09:27.262
it's time to focus on you.
So how's the book coming along?

09:27.305 --> 09:30.613
I mean, it's, you know,
it's coming. Sort of.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.224
- I know that face.
- What face?

09:34.922 --> 09:37.577
I'm trying, I swear I'm trying.
It's just, like, the divorce,

09:37.620 --> 09:40.492
and Abby, everything's so hard.

09:40.536 --> 09:43.495
I need to be straight with you.
If you don't finish your book

09:43.539 --> 09:45.889
by September, you're gonna
lose your publishing deal.

09:52.548 --> 09:55.769
We need to deal with this and
we need to move past this hump.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.653
I know what you need.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.351
- What?
- Inspiration, adventure,

10:13.395 --> 10:15.876
romance, a beautiful
place just for you.

10:15.919 --> 10:19.227
That sounds magical.
Too bad that doesn't exist.

10:19.270 --> 10:22.317
Actually, it does.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.668
Keys to my family's
place in France.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.018
I thought you were
going there this summer.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.630
You need it more
than I do. Besides,

10:30.673 --> 10:32.762
I'm completely swamped here.

10:32.806 --> 10:37.201
And if it gets that book out of you that
I know is in there, then it's a win-win.

10:37.245 --> 10:40.509
No, honey, I can't just,
like, leave my life

10:40.552 --> 10:42.511
and go frolic in France.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.992
That's crazy. Besides,
what would I do with Abby?

10:45.035 --> 10:48.125
Bring her.
You need a little crazy.

10:50.911 --> 10:54.001

- Yeah.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.220
What are we supposed to
do here for the whole summer?

11:39.263 --> 11:43.398
Can't you see how spectacular this is? How
many kids get to go to France for the summer?

11:43.441 --> 11:46.096
Spectacular is hanging out
with my friends in the city,

11:46.140 --> 11:48.664
not hanging out with adults.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.275
Oh, hi! Is this
the Everston villa?

11:51.319 --> 11:54.191
Oui, and who are you
beautiful ladies?

11:54.235 --> 11:56.759
I'm Terry, this is
my daughter Abby.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.805
I am René-Claude,
a friend of the Everstons.

11:58.848 --> 12:01.111
- Enchanté.
- Merci.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.679
Well, I hope you have
a lovely stay.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.073
- I certainly hope so.
- Au revoir.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.684
Au revoir!

12:08.728 --> 12:11.034
Mom! Mom, I have no bars!

12:11.078 --> 12:14.385
Seriously, did you even find out
if there's Wi-Fi at this place?

12:14.429 --> 12:17.780
Or what's the password? You know I have
to text Jessica the moment I get here!

12:17.824 --> 12:20.609
Abby. Take it in, honey.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.166
Excuse me?

13:40.558 --> 13:42.604
- You?
- You?

13:42.647 --> 13:44.954
What?

13:50.917 --> 13:53.136
What are you doing here?

13:53.180 --> 13:56.096
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, I live here.

13:56.139 --> 13:59.316
I know that, but your sister promised
this place to me for the summer.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.884
- Did you and my sister set this up?
- Don't flatter yourself.

14:01.928 --> 14:05.670
- Hey, you're Chef Cupid!
- Yeah, I am. And who are you?

14:05.714 --> 14:07.934
- I'm Abby.
- What are you doing here?

14:07.977 --> 14:10.066
She's my daughter.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.329
Ha! Wow. Leslie failed
to mention you had a kid.

14:12.373 --> 14:15.724
Not a kid. I'm 15, actually.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.901
- I even went to your restaurant after my homecoming.
- Yeah, what d'you think?

14:18.945 --> 14:22.252
- Meh.
- Look, I'm here for a very important reason

14:22.296 --> 14:24.951
and I can't, I mean,
we can't leave.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.562
Yeah, well, neither can I.
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,

14:27.605 --> 14:29.565
but there's a fantastic hotel
right up the street.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.828
They've got a pool, and
room service, and a... slide.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.484
- I'm calling Leslie.
- Me too.

14:39.226 --> 14:43.317
- Hello?
- Hey Leslie, I'm here at the villa and your writer friend

14:43.360 --> 14:47.495
- mysteriously showed up.
- Um...

14:47.538 --> 14:51.760
I'm really sorry, Matthew, but you didn't tell
Mom or Dad that you were gonna be going there.

14:51.803 --> 14:55.677
Dad promised me the villa,
and I promised it to Terry.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.635
- I can't take it away from her.
- Yes, you can.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.899
I don't care how you do it,
but they need to leave now.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.292
Hi, Leslie, honey, is this
your idea of a sick joke?

15:02.336 --> 15:04.773
I promise you I had no idea
he was gonna be there.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.080
What am I supposed to do
about my deadline?

15:07.123 --> 15:10.170
I've had a very traumatic experience, OK?
I need time by myself to think.

15:10.213 --> 15:15.044
Put me on speaker. The house has
nine rooms and four bathrooms.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.568
It can certainly hold three
people. You're both adults.

15:17.612 --> 15:21.355
I have faith that you can work it out and
accomplish everything you need to and have fun.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.096
Love you both.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.273
Where were we?

15:26.316 --> 15:28.144
What?

15:28.188 --> 15:32.279
Mom! Mom, I have two bars!
I'm gonna go call Jessica, OK?

15:35.760 --> 15:39.025
Alright, this is how it's going
down. I like things clean,

15:39.068 --> 15:43.029
nothing on the counters, especially
in the kitchen. If you use a knife,

15:43.072 --> 15:45.945
hand wash it, don't put it in the
dishwasher. In fact, don't use

15:45.988 --> 15:50.210
- the dishwasher at all.
- OK, fine. I like to write in the mornings, and Abby sleeps in

15:50.253 --> 15:53.430
- so you do not make a sound until 2PM.
- Fine...

15:53.474 --> 15:56.042
- It's 1:45. You don't speak.
- You're not writing.

15:56.085 --> 15:59.045
It's a rule! Deal?

15:59.088 --> 16:00.960
Deal.

16:28.683 --> 16:31.033
Morning, honey.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.080
It smells good. Is there coffee?

16:34.123 --> 16:36.560
There's a coffee maker,
but I don't know how to use it.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.388
It keeps leaking from
the bottom. So weird.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.739
Oh no, no, no, no, no. Please
tell me this isn't happening.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.742
This is my kitchen.
It's also my sanctuary.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.788
I'd appreciate it if
you would treat it as such.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.573
So you know how
the coffee maker works?

16:49.617 --> 16:51.749
Yes, I know how
the coffee maker works.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.337
And you know what? Don't touch it.
I will be in charge of the coffee.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.103
Great, can you make mine with the
mocha mix? We brought our own.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.777
Do you want a pancake? It's called a
chocolate coconut hazelnut surprise.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.369
- I can show you how to make it.
- Get it out of my face, please.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.632
- Why? You don't like food?
- When it's edible, yes.

17:04.675 --> 17:07.480
- You guys are banned from the kitchen. Out.
- What would you like us to do

17:07.503 --> 17:09.864
- when we wanna cook?
- I take it you don't cook very often.

17:10.594 --> 17:13.118
Yeah, Mom boils water and orders
takeout. I'm the cook.

17:13.162 --> 17:16.252
Don't care. Out. Out,
come on, come on. Scram.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.863
- Can you guys stop talking, please?
- No, we can't.

17:18.906 --> 17:22.737
As a matter of fact, we're amending
the house rules. Number one,

17:22.780 --> 17:26.654
I'm allowed to talk in my own house.
Number two, if you are going to cook,

17:26.696 --> 17:29.222
you need to learn
proper prep, execution,

17:29.265 --> 17:32.268
and just basic sanitation.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.705
- That's not gonna work for me.
- Get out.

17:34.749 --> 17:38.318
- Guys, I'm trying to write!
- Does anyone even care that Jessica hasn't texted me

17:38.361 --> 17:41.103
in two days? Two days, Mom!
I'm going outside.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.845
I'm going upstairs.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.716
I'm going crazy.

17:50.939 --> 17:53.159
OK.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.110
Oh!

18:31.153 --> 18:33.503
So you don't cook,
you don't date,

18:33.547 --> 18:36.593
you don't ride a bike, and you
call yourself a romance novelist.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.205
I can ride a bike.
I just don't want to.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.424
Suit yourself. It's a long walk

18:41.468 --> 18:44.993
- back from town.
- I'm a New Yorker! I love to walk!

18:46.734 --> 18:48.736
Mm-hmm.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.157
I made you some lunch.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.377
I used your tomatoes,
pine nuts, shrimp,

19:21.421 --> 19:24.467
a little bit of goat
cheese, basil, boom!

19:24.511 --> 19:27.340
You didn't cook today
and I know you're hungry.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.131
I don't even know
where to start.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.220
Presentation's hurting my eyes.

19:38.264 --> 19:42.398
A plain white plate?
No garnish?

19:42.442 --> 19:45.053
Well, then just close your eyes.

19:48.535 --> 19:51.364
So what do you think?

19:52.974 --> 19:57.021
- You just threw this together?
- Yeah.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.936
I don't have much
to work with at home,

19:58.980 --> 20:02.810
and you have some great ingredients,
so I kind of went with the flow

20:02.853 --> 20:04.855
and how I was feeling.

20:04.899 --> 20:08.642
I need to get out of here.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.522
I like it.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.442
Oh, merci. Ketchup, please?

20:26.486 --> 20:29.489
- Ketchup?
- Oui, s'il vous plaît.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.504
Excuse me, are you
Terry Russell?

20:44.547 --> 20:46.506
I am.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.901
I'm Jean-Luc. I've only
met you through your words.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.948
- Oh!
- May I?

20:53.991 --> 20:55.341
Oh yeah, please, please.

20:57.865 --> 21:01.564
You managed to elevate the romance
genre with rich characters.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.871
Are you sure you're not French?

21:03.914 --> 21:06.265
I'm pretty sure.

21:06.308 --> 21:10.486
That's really nice, Jean-Luc.
What do you do?

21:10.530 --> 21:12.923
Oh, uh, I'm a chef.

21:12.967 --> 21:16.710
Just own a little restaurant
in the next village.

21:16.753 --> 21:19.147
What are you doing in France?

21:19.190 --> 21:22.324
I'm just relaxing, trying
to write a little bit.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.196
Great idea. France
is a magical place.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.807
I'm starting to get that sense.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.637
Oh, you must come
to La Saveur de France.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.117
- The annual cook-off next month.
- Oh!

21:33.161 --> 21:35.598
Yeah, the best chefs
of all the villages compete.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.600
OK!

21:38.645 --> 21:40.777
Nice bike.
What are you doing here?

21:40.821 --> 21:44.259
Just getting some groceries.
I see you're taking in the local flavour.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.567
Matthew Everston.
What a surprise.

21:47.610 --> 21:51.135
- Very busy, non?
- Just doing a little R and R at the old villa.

21:51.179 --> 21:55.488
Jean-Luc was just telling me about
the Flavour of France competition.

21:55.531 --> 21:57.664
- You should join that.
- I don't think so.

21:57.707 --> 22:01.145
Oh, come on! You're a star chef from
New York City. What are you afraid of?

22:01.189 --> 22:04.192
Just here to relax.
I take it you won last year?

22:04.235 --> 22:07.108
Four years in a row.
This will be my fifth.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.938
- If you win.
- I will win.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.159
Well, I hope we see
each other again.

22:15.203 --> 22:17.031
I'm here all summer.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.208
Au revoir, Terry.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.341
Everston.

22:26.083 --> 22:29.217
Don't tell me you're buying
that French cheese.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.306
That guy's so charming.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.441
Why don't you have a little
omelet with your ketchup?

22:35.484 --> 22:37.617
I will.

23:21.704 --> 23:25.491
Hey. You're on your phone again?
Why don't you try living in the moment?

23:25.534 --> 23:27.710
This is your moment, not mine.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.799
Don't you wanna see
the countryside?

23:29.843 --> 23:31.671
No.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.935
What about a bike ride?

23:34.978 --> 23:37.546
- You wanna walk into town?
- No.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.679
I'm actually watching
this video of Matthew.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.477
I quit!

23:55.521 --> 23:59.525
Who is that guy? He's like
a totally different person.

23:59.568 --> 24:02.963
I know. Not like
the downer that he us now.

24:03.006 --> 24:06.445
He kind of reminds me of you when you
were fun and would write all the time.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.102
Oh, I gotta take this.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.844
What's up, Jessica?

24:14.888 --> 24:17.673
Wait, she said that about me?

24:17.717 --> 24:19.806
Why would she say that?

24:34.995 --> 24:36.997
Mmm.

24:39.129 --> 24:42.437
- What are you doing?
- That's amazing. Is there wine in there? You can taste it,

24:42.481 --> 24:45.396
- it's great.
- Would you like it if I read your unfinished book?

24:45.440 --> 24:48.574
- No.
- Well, that's my unfinished work, OK?

24:48.617 --> 24:50.619
And it's terrible.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.961
I can't sleep.

25:31.268 --> 25:32.966
Yeah, me either.

25:34.402 --> 25:37.144
Alright, well,
I'll give you your space.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.235
Wait. Wait a sec.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.064
Come back here.

25:46.153 --> 25:49.069
- I have the perfect cure for insomnia.
- Yeah?

26:00.167 --> 26:03.431
My grandpa's secret
hot chocolate recipe.

26:08.741 --> 26:11.047
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.141
- I mean, it's good.
- Right?

26:18.185 --> 26:20.448
You know what it needs, though?

26:21.667 --> 26:24.800
- No, no, no...
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.715
Can you just live
a little, please?

26:28.456 --> 26:31.938
- Ironic coming from you.
- What's that supposed to mean?

26:37.596 --> 26:40.381
- Alright, fill me up.
- Yeah.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.177
Look...

26:54.221 --> 26:57.311
- I'm sorry about before.
- Oh, don't. It's fine.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.226
We both have a lot going on.

27:01.228 --> 27:04.228
Your sister told me about your review.
I'm very sorry about your restaurant.

27:05.406 --> 27:09.149
I just haven't had a bad review
since culinary school.

27:09.192 --> 27:12.065
I used to frame mine

27:12.108 --> 27:15.242
and put them up on the wall
so I could prove them wrong.

27:18.375 --> 27:21.770
Yeah, I don't know
if I can do that.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.644
Well, you can't let them
take anything from you.

27:29.778 --> 27:32.389
I'm not letting them take my
marshmallows, that's for sure.

27:32.433 --> 27:35.175
You love it.

27:42.095 --> 27:46.142
Why would you do all that work
when you can just buy the stuff?

27:46.186 --> 27:48.231
Because it'll taste better.

27:48.275 --> 27:52.322
I wanna make you a chocolate gelato
with basil that'll blow your mind.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.803
That actually sounds
really good.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.805
You have no idea.

27:56.849 --> 28:00.766
It's one of my favourite
desserts on the planet.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.379
What's up with you?

28:05.422 --> 28:08.861
My friend Jessica's been spending
a lot of time with Savannah

28:08.904 --> 28:13.213
and she's not a cool girl.
She's... she's not nice at all.

28:15.302 --> 28:17.304
Well, that's not good.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.872
And every time we talk, she's
all weird and she has to go.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.224
Look, if there's one thing
I've learned over the years,

28:24.267 --> 28:27.793
it's that if Jessica's a real friend,
she will be there when you get back.

28:29.969 --> 28:33.320
You should help me do a little
digging over here. You up for that?

28:33.363 --> 28:35.670
- Yeah.
- Come on, then.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.368
- You dig, I'll plant.
- OK.

28:53.209 --> 28:56.430
- There you go.
- Thanks!

29:00.260 --> 29:02.088
Mmm.

29:02.131 --> 29:04.612
Matthew, that's magical.
How do you do it?

29:04.655 --> 29:08.616
Oh, that's fresh lemons
from our 300-year-old orchard,

29:08.659 --> 29:11.575
organic lavender from
the garden, no big deal.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.926
- Yeah.
- How's the writing going?

29:15.449 --> 29:18.713
It's not. No, I got nothing.

29:18.757 --> 29:22.282
And if I don't get this book
turned in, I'm done.

29:22.325 --> 29:25.589
- Sounds like you're in good shape, then.
- How do you figure that?

29:25.633 --> 29:28.418
Ah, well, at my restaurant,
we've got these nights

29:28.462 --> 29:32.945
where we're just slammed, we run out of the
special, the tables will be all impatient...

29:32.988 --> 29:35.295
I'm sorry, did you
just say good shape?

29:35.338 --> 29:37.664
It's that moment of pressure, when it's
do or die, everything's on the line;

29:37.688 --> 29:40.822
that was always
when I was at my best.

29:40.866 --> 29:43.042
So this...

29:43.085 --> 29:45.479
it's in there.

29:45.522 --> 29:48.787
The pressure's just
gonna help bring it out.

29:50.571 --> 29:54.880
- OK.
- Uh, there's a Jean-Luc here?

29:54.923 --> 29:59.145
What? He really wants me to join
that cook-off, doesn't he?

29:59.188 --> 30:03.192
- Like I got time for that.
- Nope. It's for Mom.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.411
Oh.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.420
Really?

30:13.463 --> 30:17.467
- Jean-Luc!
- Bonjour.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.820
These are beautiful!
How did you know

30:21.863 --> 30:24.518
- where to find me?
- This is a small town.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.651
Listen, you've given me
so much through your books,

30:27.695 --> 30:31.786
so I decided to make you
my special dish.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.702
- Beef bourguignon.
- Oh, my God!

30:34.745 --> 30:37.531
This is incredible! Merci!

30:37.574 --> 30:41.665
I actually came here also to ask if I
could take you out to eat some time.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.885
Oh, um...

30:43.929 --> 30:47.062
I don't know, I mean,
I've got so much work and...

30:47.106 --> 30:49.195
- I understand.
- Yeah.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.939
OK. OK, yeah, maybe.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.985
- Maybe? Maybe is good.
- Is it?

30:57.029 --> 30:59.031
- I'll take maybe.
- OK.

31:00.293 --> 31:03.209
Bonne nuit, Everston.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.342
Au revoir.

31:23.751 --> 31:26.188
I mean, it's OK.

31:26.232 --> 31:29.583
- No, it's fantastic.
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

31:29.626 --> 31:32.368
- You know why it's so good?
- The wine he used?

31:32.412 --> 31:36.285
The mushroom. He used chanterelle
instead of white button. Why haven't I

31:36.329 --> 31:39.027
- thought of that?
- And that changes the whole taste?

31:40.289 --> 31:43.031
Oh, you guys tried it!
How is it?

31:46.817 --> 31:48.602
Well, um...

31:48.645 --> 31:51.866
- That bad?
- That good.

32:17.805 --> 32:20.677
Hey, chef! We're going
on a field trip. Chop-chop!

32:20.721 --> 32:22.592
We are?

32:22.636 --> 32:25.856
Yeah. Your kitchen's down,
you're out of the special

32:25.900 --> 32:29.904
and your tables are getting
impatient. Let's go.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.430
OK, I'll go.

32:34.474 --> 32:36.302
On one condition.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.871
I got you.

32:40.915 --> 32:44.832
- No, let go. I got it, I got it.
- Got it? Ready?

32:44.875 --> 32:47.008
Ah, I'm doing it!

32:47.052 --> 32:50.446
Yes, you are.
Just like riding a bike!

32:51.926 --> 32:55.147
- You good back there?
- Yeah, I've got it!

32:55.190 --> 32:59.325
♪ Je te dis fais attention si
nous allons dans cet endroit ♪

33:00.891 --> 33:03.982
This way, this way, this way!

33:06.636 --> 33:12.251
♪ Avant la bagarre Je te préviens ♪

33:12.294 --> 33:14.209
- What is that?
- Mm, smell that.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.211
- What is it?
- It's delicious.

33:16.255 --> 33:19.345
What is it?

33:19.388 --> 33:21.869
- Oh, you're supposed to hit it?
- No, you're not a drummer.

33:23.784 --> 33:26.047
This is... Sorry.
That's so nice!

33:26.091 --> 33:29.616
- You have to try this cheese.
- Is it OK?

33:33.098 --> 33:35.752
Here, do you want the rest?

33:35.796 --> 33:39.147
I love these.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.193
What's the difference
between this and this?

33:41.236 --> 33:43.369
Um, that one's green.

33:43.412 --> 33:45.458
Dark green.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.306
- This smells so delicious.
- Yeah.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.811
OK, I'm gonna go
to the boucherie.

33:50.854 --> 33:54.162
- I will go get us gelato.
- You don't know what you're missing.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.949
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

33:58.993 --> 34:01.996
- Where's Pierre?
- You're that American chef,

34:02.040 --> 34:05.173
- aren't you?
- Yes, I am. Matthew Everston.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.567
I'm Nadia. What can
I get you, Matthew?

34:07.610 --> 34:10.744
Well, I'm not sure yet.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.487
Did you come here
to work with Jean-Luc?

34:14.530 --> 34:17.054
No, I did not come here
to work with Jean-Luc.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.621
Too bad. Jean-Luc
is amazing.

34:19.666 --> 34:23.235
Yeah, he's terrific. So what do you
have that's good? What's fresh?

34:23.277 --> 34:27.500
All of it. Everything is organic
and raised on our family farm.

34:27.543 --> 34:30.590
So everything's
the best. But, um,

34:30.632 --> 34:32.940
if you wanna try
something really special,

34:32.983 --> 34:36.900
you should try our lamb sweetbread.
Very creamy with a wonderful,

34:36.944 --> 34:39.728
- delicate flavour.
- Hm! Well, I'm convinced.

34:39.773 --> 34:43.951
But it is very difficult to cook. Maybe some
ground beef for your American hamburger?

34:43.994 --> 34:46.909
I think I can handle it.

34:46.954 --> 34:51.263
But anyway, if you have a
problem, come back for a chicken.

34:55.179 --> 34:57.573
- Good luck, chef.
- Merci.

34:57.617 --> 35:01.186
You know what? I got a better
idea. I'm gonna make you

35:01.229 --> 35:03.840
the best sweetbreads that you've
ever had in your entire life.

35:03.884 --> 35:07.366
Come by the Everston villa tonight,
up the old road, 7 o'clock.

35:07.409 --> 35:11.587
- Parfait.
- Parfait. See you soon.

35:15.983 --> 35:18.942
Looks good.

35:21.945 --> 35:26.080
Hmm. Wow.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.170
- I'll go talk to her.
- No.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.825
No, let me.

35:42.792 --> 35:44.925
I know what you're gonna say,
and the answer

35:44.968 --> 35:47.710
that you're looking for
is hiring a maid.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.278
Well, that would
definitely help,

35:50.322 --> 35:55.065
- but I actually had another idea.
- Oh yeah? What's that?

35:55.109 --> 35:57.509
Why don't you come in the kitchen
and help me cook something?

36:01.420 --> 36:03.857
Come on.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.691
Alright, here's some fennel.
Most people throw that out,

36:11.734 --> 36:13.693
but I love to use it
as a garnish. Pretty tasty.

36:13.736 --> 36:16.783
- Where should I put it?
- Just put it on top.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.935
Now, it might taste good, but
it's also that it'll look good.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.657
What are you guys cooking?
Chicken?

36:21.701 --> 36:23.877
Taste it first, then
I'll tell you what it is.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.885
I've never tasted
anything like that before.

36:31.928 --> 36:34.061
- It's good, right?
- Yeah?

36:34.104 --> 36:36.019
- What is it?
- It's lamb.

36:36.063 --> 36:38.239
- It's lamb?
- Organs.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.999
- Wait, what?
- Don't worry, it's just a pancreas.

36:40.023 --> 36:43.375
Just a panc...? Oh, gross! Guys!

36:43.418 --> 36:45.464
- You said you liked it!
- Now I need water!

36:45.507 --> 36:48.162
- Come on! Want another bite? Here you go.
- Stop!

36:48.206 --> 36:50.991
Why would you make me
eat that? What?

36:51.034 --> 36:53.254
Oh, really? Oh, really?

36:53.298 --> 36:55.909
No, don't! Stop!

36:58.041 --> 37:00.740
Ow! Stop it!

37:00.783 --> 37:04.091
Don't you dare!

37:04.134 --> 37:07.181
Abby, stop it! Ah!

37:08.661 --> 37:10.837
Matthew?

37:10.880 --> 37:13.187
Oh, the butcher.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.276
- The butcher?
- Yeah.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.191
Oh, it's the butcher.

37:19.324 --> 37:22.675
- I get it. OK, Abby, come on.
- Wait, you have a date with the butcher?

37:22.718 --> 37:26.156
No, it's not a date,
it's a butcher-chef thing.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.637
It's a business dinner.

37:28.681 --> 37:31.074
Just gimme a second.

37:35.209 --> 37:38.430
- Hey.
- Bonsoir, chef.

37:38.473 --> 37:41.607
- Nadia, hi.
- You forgot?

37:41.650 --> 37:43.913
No, no, I lost track of time.

37:43.957 --> 37:47.439
- It smells good, you cooked the sweetbreads!
- Oui...

37:50.746 --> 37:53.532
- Oh, wow!
- This is...

37:55.185 --> 37:58.450
- Look, why don't we go eat outside?
- D'accord.

38:04.499 --> 38:07.720
Mom?

38:12.159 --> 38:13.552
Mom, are you OK?

38:13.595 --> 38:16.598
Hm? Oh! Yeah, baby, I'm fine.

38:16.642 --> 38:19.471
- Why don't you call Jessica?
- That's OK.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.606
I'm kinda more into
what's going on here.

38:24.650 --> 38:27.392
Like the fact that
you sort of like Matthew?

38:27.435 --> 38:30.351
No. Abby, no.
Absolutely not.

38:30.395 --> 38:33.441
- Just checking.
- Because even if I did, which I don't,

38:33.485 --> 38:36.966
- he's on a date right now, downstairs.
- With ze butcher.

38:37.010 --> 38:40.318
Oui, ze butcher.

38:40.361 --> 38:44.322
That, downstairs?
That's just an old habit.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.150
Just like you never wanting
to put yourself out there.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.936
Hey, I do wanna put
myself out there, OK?

38:49.979 --> 38:51.851
Good.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.899
When did you get so grown-up?

38:56.943 --> 38:59.380
I don't know. I read all
the Terry Russell books.

39:02.078 --> 39:04.472
And wipe the flour
from your face.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.371
Ah, Matthew!

39:39.681 --> 39:42.205
Right?

39:42.249 --> 39:44.556
It's getting a little chilly.
Let's move in.

39:47.341 --> 39:50.692
There's a person in my home!

39:51.824 --> 39:54.827
You know what? Ah, it's stupid.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.310
So I had to catch my own fish.

40:00.354 --> 40:04.053
And there's this huge fire
and it was crazy.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.578
I don't know why I would
do something like that.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.191
I worked in Paris
for a few summers.

40:11.234 --> 40:14.150
Alrighty. No way.

40:14.194 --> 40:16.152
Oh!

40:16.196 --> 40:19.068
Yeah, those were some
great days back then.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.072
No!

40:23.116 --> 40:24.944
Ah!

40:30.123 --> 40:32.647
You OK?

40:32.691 --> 40:35.084
No, I got it. I got it.

40:36.346 --> 40:38.305
What happened?

40:38.348 --> 40:40.438
I don't know, I was
sleepwalking or something.

40:40.481 --> 40:43.963
You sleepwalked into the pool?

40:44.006 --> 40:46.313
- Is this your wife?
- My wife?

40:46.356 --> 40:49.142
- No!
- No, we're not married.

40:49.185 --> 40:51.187
He's telling the truth.
We're not.

40:51.231 --> 40:54.408
No, she's my sister's friend,
that's all she is.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.063
Yeah, I mean, yeah,
I'm his sister's friend.

40:57.106 --> 41:00.066
That's it.

41:00.109 --> 41:03.548
OK, this is too weird.
I'm sorry, I have to go.

41:03.591 --> 41:06.464
Wait!

41:10.555 --> 41:14.254
It's not a party until somebody
falls in the pool, eh?

41:26.484 --> 41:28.921
So, what is it?

41:28.964 --> 41:31.532
It is...

41:31.576 --> 41:33.708
swordfish.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.971
- Have you had it?
- Duh, I grew up in Manhattan.

41:36.015 --> 41:38.974
Mm-hmm. Alrighty, then.

41:39.018 --> 41:41.934
What do you do with it?

41:41.977 --> 41:44.719
Hm? How do you cook it?

41:44.763 --> 41:48.288
What does it go with?
You have the whole kitchen

41:48.331 --> 41:50.682
at your disposal.

41:50.725 --> 41:54.120
Who are you, and what
have you done with Matthew?

41:54.163 --> 41:57.384
- Look, Abby, you've got good instincts, alright?
- Hi, guys!

41:57.427 --> 41:59.560
Wow!

41:59.604 --> 42:01.910
Uh,

42:01.954 --> 42:05.566
- where are you off to?
- Well, it would seem I'm going on a picnic.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.568
With who?

42:10.440 --> 42:12.704
I'll get it!

42:15.750 --> 42:18.405
- You look nice.
- Thank you, you too.

42:23.410 --> 42:26.282
- Where are you guys going?
- Huh?

42:26.326 --> 42:28.371
It's a secret.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.460
- When are you gonna be home?
- Matthew!

42:30.504 --> 42:34.247
I meant, uh, what time
does Abby gotta go to bed?

42:34.290 --> 42:37.380
- We're both big girls.
- Have fun, Mom.

42:41.471 --> 42:44.605
- You have no game.
- What do you mean I have no game?

42:44.649 --> 42:48.783
- He's got no game.
- Yeah, then why is the scoreboard Jean-Luc one,

42:48.827 --> 42:51.743
Chef Cupid zero?

42:51.786 --> 42:54.006
Oh, really?

42:54.049 --> 42:57.531
Alright, well, I will
enter the contest, then.

42:59.664 --> 43:02.449
Yes! Are you serious?

43:02.492 --> 43:04.277
Yes! I'm coming
for you, Jean-Luc!

43:08.281 --> 43:10.370
You know, this reminds me
of Moonlit Promises.

43:10.413 --> 43:13.329
- What?!
- Yes, when Selina and John

43:13.373 --> 43:16.681
- walk through that meadow and find love.
- Oh, I'm so cheesy.

43:16.724 --> 43:19.727
- No, that was one of my favourites!
- You're being very sweet,

43:19.771 --> 43:21.599
thank you.

43:21.642 --> 43:24.123
I don't think you understand
how much I love your novels.

43:24.166 --> 43:28.954
I mean, you taught me that my crazy
fantasies for romance were possible.

43:28.997 --> 43:32.000
- Well, I mean, they're silly books.
- Not at all.

43:32.044 --> 43:36.004
I could do this. I could
spend summers in France

43:36.048 --> 43:38.224
and leave the craziness
of New York behind.

43:38.267 --> 43:39.878
- It suits you.
- Yeah?

43:39.921 --> 43:42.445
Walking around with his funny
little picnic basket.

43:42.489 --> 43:44.883
I don't know what
she sees in him.

43:44.926 --> 43:48.538
- I do.
- Why, because he's tan,

43:48.582 --> 43:50.758
fit and French? Boring.

43:50.802 --> 43:53.500
Boring? Are you
kidding me?

43:53.543 --> 43:57.156
My mom writes about guys like Jean-Luc,
but has never actually dated a Jean-Luc.

43:58.070 --> 44:01.508
No, no, no, no, no! Aw!

44:01.551 --> 44:03.162
Left it in too long!

44:03.205 --> 44:06.600
- So what about you?
- Well, I like to travel.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.907
- Yeah?
- I'm a car enthusiast.

44:08.950 --> 44:10.865
And I study languages.

44:10.909 --> 44:13.694
How exciting!
I love all that.

44:13.738 --> 44:17.785
Yeah, the only problem is that I don't
have anyone to share them with.

44:20.745 --> 44:24.531
A beautiful octopus salad.

44:24.574 --> 44:27.099
- Octopus?
- Mm-hmm.

44:33.888 --> 44:38.066
Jean-Luc, that's good! That's very good!
Oh, I'm in heaven right now.

44:38.110 --> 44:40.678
Well, that makes two of us.

44:42.854 --> 44:45.552
So, uh, tell me
about your next book.

44:45.595 --> 44:49.425
Um, well, it is about a woman
who's struggling at work

44:49.469 --> 44:51.950
and so she goes and spends time
in a beautiful villa

44:51.993 --> 44:54.126
- and she falls in love.
- With a Frenchman.

44:54.169 --> 44:57.912
- No, not with a Frenchman.
- Sounds like you need to do a rewrite here.

44:57.956 --> 45:01.089
Actually, her love interest
is staying in the villa with her

45:01.133 --> 45:04.484
and he's very obnoxious,
but he's charming, so she...

45:07.269 --> 45:09.707
Have I mentioned how much
I love this salad?

45:11.883 --> 45:15.756
- It's ruined.
- I don't think anything's ruined yet.

45:15.800 --> 45:18.520
- I wasn't paying attention. It's over.
- Not talking about the fish.

45:20.543 --> 45:23.653
- What are you talking about?
- All I'm saying is that there's a way to fix things.

45:23.677 --> 45:27.072
Call it the special ingredient.

45:27.115 --> 45:28.987
Raspberries?

45:29.030 --> 45:31.163
Try it.

45:38.344 --> 45:40.172
It's delicious.

45:41.347 --> 45:43.392
Good work.

45:57.189 --> 46:00.627
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Um, good.

46:00.670 --> 46:04.196
I mean, your sister would be
happy, he's read all my books.

46:05.588 --> 46:08.417
I hear a "but" coming.

46:08.461 --> 46:11.899
No, I mean, there's not
a "but". He's charming,

46:11.943 --> 46:15.468
he's handsome and he's
clearly very well read.

46:15.511 --> 46:18.558
But I'm just not sure about
the zsa-zsa-zu, you know?

46:18.601 --> 46:20.734
The zsa-zsa-what?

46:20.778 --> 46:23.824
Yeah, the zsa-zsa-zu,
like when you're, um,

46:23.868 --> 46:27.436
with someone and
you just... you know.

46:27.480 --> 46:31.049
Yeah, zsa-zsa-zu's your problem.

46:31.092 --> 46:33.747
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is,

46:33.791 --> 46:38.447
because it's not real.
It's writers like you that have created

46:38.491 --> 46:42.451
this unobtainable standard that
us men can never live up to.

46:42.495 --> 46:45.585
And the women that buy into
this zsa-zsa-zu garbage,

46:45.628 --> 46:47.848
they wonder why
they're bitter and alone.

46:47.892 --> 46:50.677
It's an excuse

46:50.720 --> 46:53.375
so they can hide and not hold
themselves accountable,

46:53.419 --> 46:57.205
like, "Oh, it didn't work out because
I couldn't find my zsa-zsa-zu."

46:57.249 --> 46:59.512
Well, it does exist.

46:59.555 --> 47:01.993
You just have the emotional
toolbox of a 17-year-old,

47:02.036 --> 47:04.865
always looking for the next
younger, prettier butcher

47:04.909 --> 47:08.042
- or whatever you're looking for.
- If calling me shallow

47:08.086 --> 47:11.089
makes you feel better about
yourself, by all means, go ahead.

47:11.132 --> 47:14.832
In your next book, instead of Trevor,
just call the villain Matthew Everston.

47:17.791 --> 47:21.099
What? How does he know
about Trevor?

48:17.982 --> 48:19.940
Abby?

48:25.772 --> 48:28.862
- Where's Abby?
- Abby?

48:30.777 --> 48:33.649
It seems that
we have been set up.

48:40.352 --> 48:42.920
Well, in that case...

48:44.747 --> 48:47.098
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

48:55.933 --> 48:58.413
- Shall we?
- We shall.

49:02.330 --> 49:05.333
Oh, wow, that's delicious.

49:05.377 --> 49:07.945
- Yeah.
- What's in that?

49:07.988 --> 49:11.774
It's like cinnamon,
a little cayenne?

49:11.818 --> 49:14.995
I had no idea my kid
could cook like this.

49:15.039 --> 49:17.258
I know, right?

49:17.302 --> 49:20.435
Look, I need to apologize

49:20.479 --> 49:23.003
about last night. No, no,
really. Just listen.

49:23.047 --> 49:26.180
I had myself all wound up

49:26.224 --> 49:28.226
and I took it out on you
and I'm sorry.

49:30.054 --> 49:32.335
Well, we both said a lot of
stuff maybe we shouldn't have.

49:34.058 --> 49:36.862
But you haven't lived with two girls
before, so I'm gonna cut you some slack.

49:36.886 --> 49:40.151
I'm sure it is challenging,
to say the least.

49:40.194 --> 49:42.805
Well, it's not that bad.

49:45.417 --> 49:48.159
Friends?

49:50.378 --> 49:52.772
Friends.

50:04.436 --> 50:07.526
- It's good, right?
- It's great.

50:53.572 --> 50:55.574
Hey there.

50:58.316 --> 51:01.101
I'm gonna go for a walk.
Wanna take a writing break?

51:01.145 --> 51:04.191
Yeah, I would love to.

51:11.111 --> 51:13.070
You came at the perfect time.

51:13.113 --> 51:15.376
I just finished my chapter.

51:15.420 --> 51:19.859
Just like Samantha from your third book, telling
people to celebrate the small victories.

51:19.902 --> 51:22.688
- It's just so embarrassing that you're reading those!
- Yeah, do not,

51:22.731 --> 51:25.232
under any circumstances, tell me
what happens with Julia and Charles.

51:25.256 --> 51:27.171
OK, done.

51:29.390 --> 51:32.350
So, this villa's been in
your family for a long time?

51:32.393 --> 51:36.658
Yeah, as long as anyone can remember.
During World War II, it was briefly used

51:36.702 --> 51:40.140
as a hospital.
There's a lot of history.

51:40.184 --> 51:43.143
Well, it is certainly
a magical place, Matthew.

51:43.187 --> 51:45.450
- It's pretty special, right?
- Yeah.

51:45.493 --> 51:48.148
Alright, stop right there.

51:48.192 --> 51:50.107
- Shut your eyes.
- What?

51:50.150 --> 51:52.544
- Shut your eyes.
- OK.

51:52.587 --> 51:55.068
- Don't move.
- I won't.

52:04.556 --> 52:06.471
- OK. Open your mouth.
- What?

52:06.514 --> 52:08.647
Trust me.

52:12.694 --> 52:15.132
It's pretty good, right?

52:17.830 --> 52:20.441
- I need to go write.
- Right now?

52:20.485 --> 52:23.227
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Wait, wait. Hold on.

52:24.880 --> 52:27.231
Before you go,
I just wanna ask you

52:27.274 --> 52:30.625
if you wanna go have dinner with me at my
favourite restaurant in the whole world.

52:30.669 --> 52:33.498
I would love that.

52:39.112 --> 52:41.288
She'd love that.

52:42.246 --> 52:45.031
Mom, what's taking so long?

52:48.730 --> 52:51.516
I don't know.
It's, like, too much.

52:51.559 --> 52:54.388
- No. No, it's beautiful.
- It's not a date.

52:54.432 --> 52:57.609
- It's not. I mean, it's dinner.
- Yeah, whatever you wanna call it.

53:00.307 --> 53:02.266
Shut up!

53:03.832 --> 53:06.052
I'm sorry for being
annoying in the beginning.

53:06.095 --> 53:09.795
- What?
- Yeah, I'm having a blast.

53:09.838 --> 53:12.101
Honey!

53:12.145 --> 53:15.453
I'm having the
best summer with you.

53:15.496 --> 53:18.847
- Really good job on the hot chocolate, by the way.
- Thanks.

53:18.891 --> 53:22.503
- Maybe there's two artists in the family.
- Yeah, yeah. I love you.

53:22.547 --> 53:25.463
You're gonna be late.
On your date!

53:32.774 --> 53:35.212
You look fantastic.

54:31.311 --> 54:34.271
- Please don't ask for ketchup. Hello.
- We are overjoyed

54:34.314 --> 54:37.293
that you could come. Please, please,
please, follow me. Your table is waiting.

54:37.317 --> 54:39.580
Fantastic, merci.

54:39.624 --> 54:43.062
I just can't believe that a
place like this actually exists.

54:43.105 --> 54:46.152
It's my favourite place
in the world. Thank you.

54:47.371 --> 54:50.504
- Oh, René! How are you?
- Good, how are you?

54:50.548 --> 54:53.290
Good to see you. Very well. Let me
introduce you to my good friend...

54:53.333 --> 54:55.770
- Terry.
- How do you...

54:55.814 --> 54:59.296
- We met. Is this your restaurant?
- Oui!

54:59.339 --> 55:01.472
- Let's have a seat.
- OK.

55:01.515 --> 55:05.302
- Tell me about René.
- He had this incredibly famous restaurant in Paris

55:05.345 --> 55:08.087
called Le Cochon de Lait,
alright? He had everything.

55:08.130 --> 55:10.742
And one day, he just
closed the doors,

55:10.785 --> 55:13.310
- came home and opened Evangeline's.
- Why?

55:15.616 --> 55:18.880
You know, I don't know.
He never told me.

55:18.924 --> 55:21.405
- So he's the one that taught you to cook.
- Yeah.

55:21.448 --> 55:24.146
Yeah, I was this really annoying

55:24.190 --> 55:27.628
13-year-old kid who, instead of
making mud pies, wanted to know

55:27.672 --> 55:29.935
how to make gourmet food,

55:29.978 --> 55:33.155
- so he was kind enough to take me under his wing.
- Excusez-moi!

55:33.199 --> 55:38.247
We've been waiting for 45 minutes and
we have not received our appetizer.

55:38.291 --> 55:41.381
And we would like to
have more wine, s'il vous plaît.

55:41.425 --> 55:44.341
- And there is no table out here either.
- Please, be patient.

55:45.994 --> 55:49.824
Gimme one sec, I'm just gonna
make sure everything's OK.

56:04.404 --> 56:07.494
René, what's going on? Where are
the cooks? Where's François?

56:07.538 --> 56:11.063
Jacques, our sous-chef, got sick,
and François didn't show up.

56:13.152 --> 56:15.633
Alright.

56:18.549 --> 56:22.379
Let's do this.

56:22.422 --> 56:26.774
Veal ragout, sole meunière,
duck confit. Alright.

56:26.818 --> 56:29.951
Here we go.

56:29.995 --> 56:33.912

was fun to watch you help him.

57:06.510 --> 57:08.599

Mom!

57:23.701 --> 57:27.226
What's up?

57:27.269 --> 57:29.881
Hey.

57:32.231 --> 57:34.886
Honey, what happened?

57:34.929 --> 57:38.498
Jessica and Savannah are saying mean
things about me on social media,

57:38.542 --> 57:43.068
like I've become a snob
because I'm in France

57:43.111 --> 57:46.375
and I've become a country girl.

57:46.419 --> 57:48.900
I don't understand.

57:48.943 --> 57:51.293
She's supposed to be
my best friend.

57:51.337 --> 57:53.470
Whoa, hang on. First of all,

57:53.513 --> 57:56.211
you shouldn't care what somebody
says or writes about you.

57:56.255 --> 57:58.736
Yeah, Matthew's right.

57:58.779 --> 58:01.521
If you just ignore them,
then they're powerless over you.

58:01.565 --> 58:05.482
Yeah, and second of all, if Jessica really
was your best friend, she wouldn't be saying

58:05.525 --> 58:08.548
- those things about you.
- No, best friends are supposed to be there for you, babe.

58:08.572 --> 58:12.010
- They pick you up when you're down.
- Make you laugh.

58:12.053 --> 58:14.360
Motivate you.

58:14.403 --> 58:16.580
None of this would have happened

58:16.623 --> 58:19.931
if you didn't bring me
to this stupid villa.

59:03.844 --> 59:06.064
You got a minute?

59:09.937 --> 59:11.896
I know you're pretty upset.

59:13.245 --> 59:15.421
Mean girls, man...

59:17.641 --> 59:20.339
Look, I want you to know
that in life,

59:20.382 --> 59:22.907
friends are gonna
come and go, babe.

59:22.950 --> 59:27.041
So are boys, and work,
and parties.

59:29.130 --> 59:33.091
But the one thing that does not ever,
ever, ever go away is your passion.

59:34.919 --> 59:39.010
And you found that this summer,
you did. I'm so proud of you.

59:43.405 --> 59:47.366
So, I know Matthew's over at Evangeline's
and they could really use some help

59:47.409 --> 59:49.498
in the kitchen.

59:49.542 --> 59:51.588
What do you say?
You wanna go over there?

59:53.415 --> 59:56.593
- Yeah.
- You're a good girl, Abby.

59:57.942 --> 59:59.770
Come on.

01:00:08.474 --> 01:00:11.477
Keep your fingers safe
with your knuckles.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.392
That's it.

01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:16.395
- She's a natural, just like you.
- Oh, yeah?

01:00:21.052 --> 01:00:23.445
- Hey, hey.
- Jean-Luc!

01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:25.491
How are you?

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.451
CÇa va et toi?

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:34.456
- I knew you were here.
- I am, I am. I'm fine.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.242
I just, I've been
really busy writing and...

01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:39.505
Yeah, I'm here. I'm helping out.

01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:42.160
How about joining me
for a drink later?

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:46.381
Oh, Jean-Luc, um, I'm so sorry.
I have to help Matthew

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:48.645
get ready for the Flavour
of France competition.

01:00:50.821 --> 01:00:54.041
Oh. I didn't know.

01:00:54.085 --> 01:00:56.522
- He's competing?
- Yeah.

01:00:56.565 --> 01:00:58.655
It looks like it.

01:01:04.835 --> 01:01:07.315
I'm going to win, you know.

01:01:08.577 --> 01:01:10.536
He's very good.

01:01:16.629 --> 01:01:18.544
Oh, wow!

01:01:18.587 --> 01:01:21.416
You do know that you're
totally gonna win, right?

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.766
Maybe you're right.

01:01:24.115 --> 01:01:26.987
But if I'm even
gonna have a chance,

01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:28.728
I need a sous-chef.

01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:33.211
Me? Are you kidding me?
Yes! Yes, I'd love to!

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:35.561
- René, I'm gonna need you too.
- Oui, oui!

01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:38.520

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.273
Coq au vin?

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:39.625
Why would I go back to
the dish that destroyed me?

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:42.236
The plan is to reinvent myself.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.718
You can reinvent yourself
by reinventing the dish.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.894
And how am I supposed
to do that?

01:02:47.938 --> 01:02:50.636
You know what
my favourite food is?

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.464
Toaster pastries.

01:02:52.507 --> 01:02:55.119
OK, just stop talking.

01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:57.599
No, listen. Anytime I start
to get bored with them,

01:02:57.643 --> 01:03:00.646
they come out with
a magical new flavour.

01:03:00.689 --> 01:03:03.214
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying do your dish,

01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:05.303
but make it new and improved.

01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:20.579
Hey now. It's your big day,
how are you holding up?

01:03:37.552 --> 01:03:40.294
OK, I have a feeling today
is gonna be a good day,

01:03:40.338 --> 01:03:43.776
so in light of that,
I grant you permission to speak.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.170
If it pleases my grace.

01:03:47.432 --> 01:03:50.827
Look, whatever happens,
thank you.

01:03:52.002 --> 01:03:54.526
- Come here.
- Come over there?

01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:07.104
- Go.
- It's the worst timing.

01:04:07.147 --> 01:04:09.193
Just go.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.849
There he is!

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:15.292
- What are you doing here?
- Bringing you back from the dead.

01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:19.638
Wow! This place is amazing.

01:04:19.681 --> 01:04:22.380
- Who are you?
- I'm Terry.

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:24.730
- Who are you?
- Diane, Matthew's business manager.

01:04:24.773 --> 01:04:27.298
- Oh!
- What happened to flying under the radar?

01:04:27.341 --> 01:04:29.953
- Dominic Barone is coming to the cook-off?
- You're welcome.

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:33.347
- Dominic Barone the food critic?
- I got the vegetables.

01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:36.220
Oh, hi! Are you
an intern, sweetie?

01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:38.570
You should not have
sprung this on me.

01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:42.966
Don't worry about it.
I got this. OK?

01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:46.534
Let's go win a contest.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:55.935
OK.

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:58.416
Go get 'em. How can I help?

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.813
Hey, Mr. Barone.
It's good to see you.

01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:07.512
As if your manager
gave me any choice.

01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:10.515
- Yeah.
- But she did say you would make it worth my while.

01:05:10.558 --> 01:05:13.083
I'm gonna do my best.

01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:15.781
- Good. Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:23.006
Hi. An honour.

01:05:23.049 --> 01:05:25.486
What if he's right?
What if I've lost my mojo?

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:28.925
Well, sometimes you gotta
lose your mojo to get it back.

01:05:30.622 --> 01:05:33.364
Why don't you just cook like
you're cooking for me and Abby?

01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:37.237
OK.

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:39.936
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:12.316
Maybe you should
focus on the dish.

01:06:14.622 --> 01:06:16.842
Good point.

01:06:21.412 --> 01:06:23.936
Bonjour, and welcome to the
42nd annual Flavour of France,

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:27.679
celebrating our villages
and all of our best chefs.

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:30.551
- Game face, Matthew.
- You will have two hours to cook

01:06:30.595 --> 01:06:33.467
- your signature dish while the rest of us drink wine.
- Great.

01:06:33.511 --> 01:06:36.862
Then, our judges will taste.

01:06:36.905 --> 01:06:39.517
- Double great.
- Scores will be allocated and the winner

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.346
will be announced. Ready,

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:45.523
set, cook!

01:06:48.265 --> 01:06:51.616
- Abby, can you prepare the lavender garlic butter?
- Got it, chef.

01:06:56.969 --> 01:06:59.624
René, let's sear these suckers.

01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:05.238
So Terry, what
brought you to France?

01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:09.068
I'm a romance novelist and
I guess I kind of got blocked,

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:11.810
so I came here
in search of a story.

01:07:11.853 --> 01:07:13.942
Did you find one?

01:07:13.986 --> 01:07:15.988
I think so.

01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:28.000
Jean-Luc!

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.742
Jean-Luc!
Jean-Luc! Jean-Luc!

01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:36.704
We've reached the
halfway point, chefs!

01:07:39.533 --> 01:07:41.492
- How are the mashed potatoes?
- On track.

01:07:44.016 --> 01:07:46.018
Come on, Abby!

01:07:47.715 --> 01:07:50.675
How's the braise?

01:07:50.718 --> 01:07:53.330
Jean-Luc! Jean-Luc! Jean-Luc!

01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:08.606
Coq au vin, really?
Is he doing that on purpose?

01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:23.142
Matthew, forget him, OK?
This is your dish too.

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:25.752
Come on, Matthew,
think. Think.

01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:35.807
Abby, make your raspberry sauce.

01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:39.984
The wrong ingredient will knock
us out of the competition.

01:08:40.028 --> 01:08:43.423
- I don't know...
- I hit rock bottom because I was not taking chances anymore.

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:45.947
That sauce is a chance
that I'm willing to take.

01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:49.167
You're not an amateur.
You're a chef.

01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:52.084
Now make it happen.

01:08:57.350 --> 01:08:59.831
- Et voilà.
- Five, four,

01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:03.356
three, two, one!

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:05.750
- Time's up!
- OK.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.845
Raspberries on coq au vin?

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:17.457
- That's a bold choice.
- Yeah, just try it.

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:28.163
- Merci, chef.
- Thank you, Matthew.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:36.524
Look, whatever happens,
kid, you did a great job.

01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:41.457
If I got a restaurant to go back to in New York,
that dish is definitely going on the menu.

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:43.309
- Really?
- Yeah?

01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:46.573
Well, you do have a restaurant
here if you want, Matthew.

01:09:46.617 --> 01:09:49.837
I think it's time for you
to take over Evangeline's.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:54.189
- What are you talking about?
- It is time to announce

01:09:54.233 --> 01:09:56.583
our Flavour of France winner!

01:09:56.627 --> 01:09:58.890
Chef...

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:01.545
Matthew Everston!

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:06.463
- Bravo!
- You did it!

01:10:06.506 --> 01:10:09.205
Ah, I'm so proud!

01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:11.294
Come on down, Matthew!

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:13.992
Congratulations.

01:10:14.035 --> 01:10:16.473
Merci beaucoup!
Thank you all very much!

01:10:16.516 --> 01:10:18.866
- I don't believe it!
- You did it too.

01:10:23.741 --> 01:10:26.222
I guess the best man won.

01:10:26.918 --> 01:10:29.399
Yes, he did.

01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:31.705

Mr. Barone.

01:11:05.522 --> 01:11:08.307
Hey, look, I want to apologize
for how I acted in New York.

01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:12.398
Everything you said was true.
Honestly, you did me a huge favor.

01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:15.140
I know, because
your cooking today

01:11:15.183 --> 01:11:17.534
was absolutely extraordinary.

01:11:19.057 --> 01:11:21.277
Well done.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.976
Thank you very much, sir. Coming
from you, that means a lot. René!

01:11:25.019 --> 01:11:27.805
I'd love for you to meet Mr.
Dominic Barone, from the Times.

01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:30.634
- This is my mentor.
- It's an honour, sir.

01:11:32.244 --> 01:11:34.594
Matthew told me
about the mix-up.

01:11:34.638 --> 01:11:36.596
It's a great story.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.860
- Yeah, I mean, we got used to each other.
- I can tell.

01:11:39.904 --> 01:11:43.299
The thing is, Matthew sweeps
women off their feet

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:47.128
and then he moves on.
He's Chef Cupid; it's who he is.

01:11:47.172 --> 01:11:49.740
It's not gonna change
anytime soon.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.082
- Throw a little paprika in there.
- Yeah? You think so?

01:12:28.126 --> 01:12:30.998
Oh yeah. We're
getting fancy.

01:12:32.913 --> 01:12:36.613
- What are you guys doing?
- Oh, just talking about cooking.

01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:39.659
- I got a little surprise for ya.
- Yeah?

01:12:39.703 --> 01:12:42.053
Try this.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.231
Mmm! That's delicious.

01:12:46.274 --> 01:12:48.233
Love that you didn't
ask what it was.

01:12:48.276 --> 01:12:50.496
- No, really, what is it?
- You don't wanna know.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:54.239
OK, so there's something
that I wanna show to you

01:12:54.282 --> 01:12:57.174
- and I'm kind of nervous about it, so if you could just...
- It happened! It happened!

01:12:57.198 --> 01:12:59.897
- You gotta read this!
- What happened? What are you talking about?

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:02.856
Is this the lifestyle section?

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:06.338
"Inventive Flavour
of France recipes:

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.702
"local fare never
tasted so fresh.

01:13:09.994 --> 01:13:13.432
Chef Everston found himself in France.
We can only hope that he'll return to us."

01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:17.088
The Guardian, Vogue, Bon Appétit,
everyone is writing about you.

01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:20.439
- You're the comeback kid.
- I can't believe this came out so fast.

01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:25.183
That's not it. Producers in LA want
you to do a show called Chef Cupid.

01:13:25.226 --> 01:13:28.534
Every week you'll go to a different
location: Rome, Barcelona,

01:13:28.578 --> 01:13:32.930
Tokyo. You'll cook a different romantic meal
for a different single woman every week.

01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:35.367
- Are you kidding?
- No.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.848
Oh, that's incredible!

01:13:37.891 --> 01:13:40.981
- I'm back!
- Congratulations.

01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:42.983
- I'm back!
- Yeah.

01:13:43.027 --> 01:13:45.290
This is crazy!

01:13:46.073 --> 01:13:47.597
Wow!

01:13:49.033 --> 01:13:51.601
Oh, I'm sorry, what were
you saying? You want me

01:13:51.644 --> 01:13:53.622
- to see something?
- No, don't worry about it. It's nothing.

01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:55.866
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.215
- OK.
- Congrats.

01:13:57.258 --> 01:13:58.695
Thank you!

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:04.744
Chef Cupid's back.

01:14:08.748 --> 01:14:12.186
Hey! I miss you.
How's it going?

01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.407
Great. I've finished the book.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.888
Hurray.

01:14:17.931 --> 01:14:21.369
That's the saddest hurray
I've ever heard in my life.

01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:24.329
I think you're gonna
like it. It, uh,

01:14:24.372 --> 01:14:27.811
it's good. I put
everything I had into it.

01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:31.554
I am so proud of you!
Honestly, this is a huge accomplishment!

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:33.556
Mm-hmm.

01:14:33.599 --> 01:14:35.688
Also...

01:14:35.732 --> 01:14:39.170
I kind of fell in love
with your brother.

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:42.608
- Oh, no. No, you didn't.
- I did. I showed up

01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:45.263
to write, and he was here,
and he was just, like,

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:47.265
"Oh, you can't eat that,"

01:14:47.308 --> 01:14:49.920
and he made me try
all these new things

01:14:49.963 --> 01:14:53.097
and I didn't like it.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.187
Then I saw what you meant.
He really...

01:14:57.449 --> 01:14:59.886
He's, like, the best guy.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:03.847
And now he's gonna go do
this Chef Cupid show

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:06.850
where he's got all these
single ladies in the audience

01:15:06.893 --> 01:15:10.506
and he's cooking for them, and
I'm going back to my apartment.

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:14.510
And I'm probably gonna die of fructose and
preservatives and no one's gonna care.

01:15:15.859 --> 01:15:20.167
Terry, you are
a wonderful mother.

01:15:20.211 --> 01:15:23.910
You are my favourite author
and you're actually

01:15:23.954 --> 01:15:26.522
one of the nicest people
I've ever known, OK?

01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:28.804
This is the first time I've seen
you out of your comfort zone

01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:32.092
in years. You should be
really proud of yourself.

01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:34.312
OK.

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:37.141
Come home.

01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:46.411
I think it's time
to go to New York.

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:59.250
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:05.430
- What are you doing?
- Summer's over. It's time to go home.

01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:12.089
So you're just gonna leave?

01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:14.047
Can we talk about it?

01:16:16.484 --> 01:16:18.835
Yeah. Yeah, come here.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:33.632
- This has been a wonderful summer, Matthew.
- Yeah.

01:16:33.676 --> 01:16:35.721
I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

01:16:37.854 --> 01:16:42.467
You really opened up my world, and I just
want you to know that I'm grateful for it.

01:16:43.294 --> 01:16:45.688
That's it?

01:16:45.731 --> 01:16:49.996
Well, no, I mean, we're gonna go have dinner
at Evangeline's to say goodbye to René.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.390
No, I mean, that's...

01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:55.785
that's it between us?

01:16:58.352 --> 01:17:01.268
You're going back
to being Chef Cupid.

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:04.750
And I'm gonna go back to...

01:17:04.794 --> 01:17:07.623
writing about romance.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:19.678
When do you leave?

01:17:19.722 --> 01:17:22.507
On the red eye tonight.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:24.988
Come here, gimme a hug.

01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:41.004
What is it?

01:17:42.614 --> 01:17:45.182
Open it, find out.

01:17:54.757 --> 01:17:57.020
René gave that to me
when I was your age.

01:17:57.063 --> 01:18:00.501
And you're just gonna
give this to me?

01:18:01.938 --> 01:18:05.419
Abby, you have
this unique ability

01:18:05.463 --> 01:18:08.509
to look at things
in a very different way.

01:18:09.728 --> 01:18:12.122
Don't ever lose that.

01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:15.473
Yeah. I'm gonna miss you.

01:18:15.516 --> 01:18:18.432
I'm gonna miss you too, kid.

01:18:18.476 --> 01:18:21.131
But you're gonna come
visit me, right?

01:18:21.174 --> 01:18:23.220
Yeah. We'll cook together.

01:18:23.263 --> 01:18:25.222
Hmm...

01:20:50.802 --> 01:20:53.413
Diane! There you are.

01:20:53.457 --> 01:20:57.069
Yeah, I wanna talk to you about
your schedule. I mean, it's crazy,

01:20:57.113 --> 01:20:59.506
- but we can do this.
- Listen.

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:03.032
I can't go back
to New York with you.

01:21:06.165 --> 01:21:08.733
I'm not Chef Cupid anymore.

01:21:09.473 --> 01:21:11.736
I want different things.

01:21:11.779 --> 01:21:14.870
Because you think
you're in love?

01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:20.614
- I gotta go.
- Matthew.

01:21:20.658 --> 01:21:21.920
Yeah?

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:25.750
I'm happy for you.

01:21:25.793 --> 01:21:27.578
OK.

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:43.899
When I close the restaurant, I will
come visit you in New York City.

01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:47.685
Can we go row boating
in Central Park?

01:21:47.728 --> 01:21:49.252
Yeah, sure.

01:21:51.123 --> 01:21:54.953
But I don't want you to close
Evangeline's. I can help out.

01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:57.956
- I can come back next summer.
- Oh, you know I would love that,

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.395
chérie, but it's time for
this place to say bonne nuit.

01:22:02.439 --> 01:22:05.268
You and your mother will
always have a place here

01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:08.401
- in France.
- René.

01:22:08.445 --> 01:22:10.795
Thank you for everything.

01:22:13.363 --> 01:22:15.234
Thanks, René.

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:27.203
Go!

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:43.064
So I figured out why René left
everything back in Paris.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:45.264
Why?

01:22:45.308 --> 01:22:47.484
'Cause he fell in love
with Evangeline.

01:22:49.747 --> 01:22:52.358
He didn't care about fame, he
just wanted to do what he loved

01:22:52.402 --> 01:22:54.708
with the person
that he loved the most.

01:22:54.752 --> 01:22:56.991
Love is what makes this place magical.
Everybody that comes here

01:22:57.015 --> 01:22:59.583
feels it. It's infectious.

01:23:01.063 --> 01:23:03.935
What are you doing
here, Matthew?

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.589
I fell in love.

01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:11.595
I'm sorry that I acted stupid and got
caught up in all that craziness.

01:23:11.638 --> 01:23:14.511
I had all of that.
It just made me miserable.

01:23:14.554 --> 01:23:18.558
- You have your TV show and your investors.
- I don't care about that.

01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:21.997
- I care about you and Abby.
- But you worked so hard for this.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.001
I can cook anywhere.
Everything I need is right here.

01:23:27.785 --> 01:23:30.701
- You know that I read your manuscript?
- You did?

01:23:32.746 --> 01:23:34.748
Well, what did you think?

01:23:34.792 --> 01:23:37.055
I thought it was fantastic.

01:23:37.099 --> 01:23:39.492
And it's our story.

01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:41.712
I kind of need to know
what happens next.

01:23:46.195 --> 01:23:48.893
I'm just scared you're gonna
change your mind.

01:23:48.936 --> 01:23:51.374
I wanna do this with you.

01:23:51.417 --> 01:23:53.637
You and Abby are
everything to me.

01:23:59.469 --> 01:24:01.558
I love you, Terry Russell.

01:24:16.573 --> 01:24:18.575
Oh, I love you too.

01:24:26.235 --> 01:24:29.586
- Hey!
- I knew you had it in you.

01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:32.023
Champagne!

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.720
Merci!

01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:41.076
Well, guys,

01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:44.296
I just figured out
the special ingredient.

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:46.951
Oh?
