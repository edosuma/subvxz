00:10.963 --> 00:13.287
Previously on 24.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.653
This is Meredith Reed.

00:15.721 --> 00:17.837
Ms. Reed, the people that you
think are responsible

00:17.905 --> 00:20.560
for killing President Hassan
were not working alone.

00:20.628 --> 00:22.777
They were being funded
and managed by people working

00:22.845 --> 00:24.042
inside the Russian government.

00:24.043 --> 00:26.173
<i>How do you know this?</i>

00:26.241 --> 00:28.003
I'm being set up, just like you
were yesterday.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.738
I need to get this evidence
to you.

00:29.806 --> 00:33.476
Arlo got a cell phone intercept
report off NSA's Echelon.

00:33.544 --> 00:34.975
Keywords: "Jack Bauer."

00:34.976 --> 00:36.606
<i>PILLAR:
We confirmed the voiceprint.</i>

00:36.674 --> 00:37.706
Reed's connection
to Hassan means

00:37.707 --> 00:38.972
she'd be highly motivated
to help him.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.671
Take it to the press.
That's his next move.

00:41.738 --> 00:43.671
This is a major opportunity

00:43.738 --> 00:45.870
to make everything
go away, sir:

00:45.938 --> 00:47.269
Bauer and the evidence.

00:47.270 --> 00:48.670
I need to find Jack...

00:48.671 --> 00:50.505
<i>or else they're gonna kill him.</i>

00:50.572 --> 00:53.674
If we can get to him,
we can expose the cover-up.

00:53.742 --> 00:55.709
Jack's gotta be working
with someone. Who?

00:55.776 --> 00:58.210
I don't know. I never saw 'em,
but Jack showed up with

00:58.278 --> 00:59.912
state-of-the-art
weapons and comms.

00:59.980 --> 01:01.414
Pavel, do you see Bauer?

01:01.415 --> 01:03.248
If you have a shot, take it.

01:03.316 --> 01:05.680
I've got him.

01:05.748 --> 01:07.414
Put it down.

01:07.481 --> 01:09.345
Everything's all clear
up on top, Jack.

01:09.413 --> 01:11.844
Come with me.
Do exactly what I say.

01:11.912 --> 01:15.048
(shouting and screaming)

01:16.348 --> 01:17.348
Move!

01:17.349 --> 01:18.749
<i>PILLAR:
He knew it was a trap.</i>

01:18.750 --> 01:20.183
The evidence is on
this memory card.

01:20.250 --> 01:22.050
Take it.

01:22.118 --> 01:24.218
<i>As soon as you see it,
you'll know it's real.</i>

01:24.286 --> 01:25.752
DANA: The hit on Hassan
is all arranged.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.385
Bazhaev and his people are
taking care of everything.

01:28.452 --> 01:30.585
I already know
that you killed Renee Walker.

01:30.653 --> 01:33.288
What I want to know is the
name of the Russian pig

01:33.355 --> 01:36.355
inside your government
that gave the order.

01:36.423 --> 01:38.289
Where's the SIM card
for your phone?

01:39.624 --> 01:41.925
You dumb bastard,
you swallowed it.

01:42.794 --> 01:44.692
This is

01:44.760 --> 01:46.926
for my friend.

01:46.994 --> 01:48.760
(grunts, crunching)

01:53.693 --> 01:56.494
MAN: You've reached the mobile
number of President Charles Logan.

ANGELA: As a principal
player in this

02:09.506 --> 02:12.073
unprecedented and historic
peace initiative,

02:12.141 --> 02:14.676
Secretary of State Kanin's
untimely decision

02:14.777 --> 02:19.180
to withdrew for health reasons
was a difficult one.

02:19.247 --> 02:22.539
However, the president wishes it
to be known

02:22.607 --> 02:26.072
that in Secretary Kanin's
absence and per his own

02:26.140 --> 02:28.941
recommendation, she has sought
and gained the counsel

02:29.008 --> 02:31.275
of former President
Charles Logan.

02:31.343 --> 02:34.377
Now, the president

02:34.445 --> 02:37.946
is acutely aware that this
decision bears some controversy.

02:38.014 --> 02:42.449
But President Logan's experience
with foreign policy

02:42.516 --> 02:44.750
and his skills in negotiation

02:44.818 --> 02:46.751
have already proven
to be a great asset

02:46.819 --> 02:49.820
in these final hours before the
signing of the peace agreement

02:49.887 --> 02:51.354
with the Islamic Republic.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.622
Once Mrs. Hassan...

02:53.690 --> 02:54.856
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

02:54.857 --> 02:56.190
...and the IRK delegation...

02:56.191 --> 02:58.658
Your car to the heliport
is ready and waiting downstairs.

02:58.726 --> 03:00.492
Has, uh, President Suvarov's
plane arrived yet?

03:00.560 --> 03:01.827
It should be

03:01.828 --> 03:03.327
touching down at JFK
within the next 20

03:03.395 --> 03:05.095
to 30 minutes,
and then he'll be choppered in

03:05.163 --> 03:06.329
to the 93rd Street
Heliport.

03:06.330 --> 03:07.497
Thank you, Ellen.

03:07.498 --> 03:08.831
Tell them
I'll be down in a moment.

03:08.832 --> 03:10.465
Yes, sir.

03:11.167 --> 03:12.633
ANGELA (on TV):
Once Mrs. Hassan

03:12.701 --> 03:16.104
and the IRK delegation
have hashed out a few remaining

03:16.171 --> 03:17.405
points of protocol
with President Taylor...

03:17.406 --> 03:18.639
(phone ringing)

03:18.640 --> 03:22.876
...the signing will commence
as scheduled.

03:28.445 --> 03:30.479
Tell me
you have a lead on Bauer.

03:30.547 --> 03:31.714
PILLAR:
I'm sorry, sir.

03:31.715 --> 03:33.482
We tracked him
to an adjacent building,

03:33.549 --> 03:36.083
but Bauer managed
to get out of the cordon,

03:36.151 --> 03:38.618
along with the reporter
Meredith Reed.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.518
Also, he's killed Pavel.

03:40.586 --> 03:42.153
I've taken
jurisdictional control

03:42.220 --> 03:43.854
over the scene from NYPD.

03:43.922 --> 03:46.756
We should be able to keep
this contained, but it...

03:46.823 --> 03:48.490
it's not gonna matter

03:48.558 --> 03:50.525
if Bauer's already
passed along the evidence

03:50.593 --> 03:52.626
he got from Dana Walsh
to the press.

03:52.694 --> 03:54.961
The story's going to come out.

03:55.029 --> 03:56.462
No, not necessarily.

03:56.463 --> 03:58.497
We still might be able
to manage this.

03:58.565 --> 04:00.031
Look, sir,
I- I know you've told me

04:00.099 --> 04:01.599
that you're committed
to seeing this through,

04:01.667 --> 04:03.801
but you can still extricate
yourself from this mess.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.702
There's no evidence
of your involvement yet.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.470
You can still delay
the press announcement.

04:07.538 --> 04:08.971
It's too late
for that, Jason.

04:09.039 --> 04:10.839
The White House
Press Secretary just announced

04:10.907 --> 04:12.640
my role in the
peace process.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.241
There is no turning back.

04:14.309 --> 04:15.976
And there's something else
you should know.

04:16.043 --> 04:18.879
Bauer didn't just kill Pavel.

04:18.947 --> 04:20.613
He butchered him.

04:20.682 --> 04:23.817
He beat him savagely,
and then he eviscerated him.

04:23.885 --> 04:25.318
I don't think
Bauer's just looking

04:25.319 --> 04:26.786
to expose the Russians'
involvement

04:26.854 --> 04:28.654
in the plot against Hassan.

04:28.722 --> 04:30.656
This guy's out for blood.

04:32.224 --> 04:35.193
Then you better find him
and stop him, hadn't you?

04:35.260 --> 04:37.761
Yes, sir.

04:37.796 --> 04:39.663
Keep me posted.

04:44.101 --> 04:46.636
I'm not going any further

04:46.703 --> 04:49.071
till you tell me
what happened back there.

04:49.138 --> 04:50.538
You killedhat man, dn't you?

04:50.539 --> 04:51.973
Ms. Reed, your
life is in danger.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.707
You want to get through
this thing alive,

04:53.775 --> 04:55.642
you're gonna do
exactly what I say.

04:55.710 --> 04:57.077
Do you understand?

04:57.078 --> 04:58.645
Jack, I can't get a locate

04:58.712 --> 05:01.013
on the number you called
from this phone.

05:01.081 --> 05:02.248
It's restricted.

05:02.249 --> 05:03.482
I'm gonna have
to route a back trace.

05:03.483 --> 05:04.550
Can you do it here?

05:04.551 --> 05:06.152
No. I need the equipment
at my place.

05:06.220 --> 05:07.587
Get back to me as soon
as you got a location.

05:07.588 --> 05:08.722
All right.
Let's go.

05:08.723 --> 05:10.124
Who is it
you're looking for?

05:10.125 --> 05:12.526
Someone who can give me the
names of everyone se involved.

05:12.593 --> 05:14.527
And what are you gonna do
when you finthem?

05:14.595 --> 05:16.329
It doesn't concern you.
How can I trust you

05:16.397 --> 05:18.765
if you don't tell me
what you're doing?

05:18.832 --> 05:20.833
Because I'm not the person
who's trying tkill y.

05:20.934 --> 05:23.235
The video file
that I gavyou

05:23.302 --> 05:25.904
is the onlproof of
the Russians' mplicity

05:25.972 --> 05:27.339
President Hassan's
assaination.

05:27.340 --> 05:29.175
But the conspicy doesn
end with the Russians.

05:29.243 --> 05:30.843
There are people within
our own government

05:30.911 --> 05:33.246
that are trying cer this
up, including President Taylor.

05:33.313 --> 05:34.981
Why would the president
want this covered up?

05:35.049 --> 05:38.052
Because she's trying to keep the
peace accord alive with the IRK.

05:38.119 --> 05:40.054
And she knows if
Dalia Hassan finds out

05:40.121 --> 05:42.522
that the Russians had a hand
in the death of her husband,

05:42.590 --> 05:43.757
she'll never
sign the agreement.

05:43.758 --> 05:45.692
What do you want from me?

05:45.760 --> 05:49.561
I need you to break the
story in casI don't make it.

05:49.628 --> 05:54.365
I think Presidt Hassan
deserves that, don't you?

05:54.432 --> 05:56.600
Leme see
your cell phone.

05:56.667 --> 06:00.402
Okay.

06:00.470 --> 06:01.937
Wait.
at are you doing? I...

06:01.938 --> 06:03.237
They've seen
you with me.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.939
The authorities are
going to start monitoring

06:05.007 --> 06:06.473
your usual forms
of communicaon.

06:06.474 --> 06:09.043
You can't go home, you
can't go back to your office.

06:09.111 --> 06:11.479
Is there anyone that you
work with that you trust?

06:11.547 --> 06:13.480
Uh, my edito Gary Klausner.

06:13.548 --> 06:15.415
You need to try and
get him the evidence.

06:15.483 --> 06:17.650
I can get you as
far as a pay phone.

06:17.718 --> 06:20.456
After that,
you're on your own.

06:20.523 --> 06:22.059
I'm glad we were able
to come to terms.

06:22.126 --> 06:23.494
So am I.

06:23.495 --> 06:25.529
Thank you, Madam President,
for your pience with me.

06:25.596 --> 06:27.097
I am still new to this.

06:27.164 --> 06:29.332
You are a natural
leader, Dalia,

06:29.400 --> 06:31.700
and you have a superb
advisor in Minister Jamot.

06:31.768 --> 06:34.403
I appreciate the endorsement,
Madam President.

06:34.470 --> 06:35.637
Pardon me...

06:35.638 --> 06:37.039
for interrupting.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.607
We were just finishing up.

06:38.675 --> 06:39.975
Dalia Hassan.

06:39.976 --> 06:41.910
Charles Logan.

06:41.978 --> 06:44.413
I'm honored to finally
meet you, Mrs. Hassan.

06:44.481 --> 06:46.481
I was a great admirer
of your husband.

06:46.549 --> 06:48.016
I'm so sorry for you loss.

06:48.017 --> 06:49.183
Thank you.

06:49.184 --> 06:50.550
President Taylor tells me

06:50.551 --> 06:51.884
you were instrumental

06:51.885 --> 06:53.684
in convincing the
Russian delegates to stay

06:53.752 --> 06:55.686
at the negotiating table.
I'm honored to play

06:55.754 --> 06:58.455
even a sll part
in such an historic event.

07:00.025 --> 07:04.394
Madam President, may I
have a few moments with you?

07:06.597 --> 07:08.597
I'll see you
at the signing.

07:13.702 --> 07:15.168
You still haven't found out

07:15.236 --> 07:17.570
how Logan convinced
thRussians to stay?

07:17.637 --> 07:18.804
I've investigated it,

07:18.805 --> 07:20.271
but I learned nothing
from the delegates.

07:20.272 --> 07:22.073
I can have our intelligence
service look into it.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.309
No. Thank you, Jamot.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.244
I trust President Taylor.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.613
We have to assume
that if she involved Logan,

07:27.680 --> 07:29.380
it was for a good reason.

07:38.590 --> 07:41.759
The operation to capture
Jack Bauer was unsuccessful.

07:41.827 --> 07:43.428
He got away,
along with the evidence

07:43.495 --> 07:44.929
that he took from Dana Walsh.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.998
You said you had the
situation under control.

07:47.065 --> 07:50.735
Clearly,
I was overly optimistic.

07:50.802 --> 07:53.504
And in my optimism,

07:53.571 --> 07:54.972
I neglected to tell you

07:55.040 --> 07:56.874
that Bauer made contact
wi a journalist.

07:56.941 --> 07:58.108
Meredith Reed.

07:58.109 --> 07:59.476
My God...

07:59.477 --> 08:01.511
You need to call her
publisher right away.

08:01.579 --> 08:05.147
Deny any foreknowledge of
whatever evidence she has,

08:05.215 --> 08:07.715
and demand that they
do not run the sto.

08:07.783 --> 08:10.084
You're suggesting
muzzling the press?

08:10.152 --> 08:12.653
Have you forgotten
that freedom of the press is

08:12.720 --> 08:14.054
Constitutionally
protected?

08:14.055 --> 08:15.956
You are the president,
for God's sake.

08:16.024 --> 08:17.491
Invoke national security.

08:17.558 --> 08:20.193
You tell them this
story will start a war.

08:20.261 --> 08:22.195
Innocent lives
will be lost.

08:22.263 --> 08:23.863
New lies to cover the old ones.

08:23.931 --> 08:26.399
The time has passed for hand
wringing, Madam President.

08:26.466 --> 08:28.767
If you don't use the
power of your office

08:28.835 --> 08:30.268
to shut this story down,

08:30.336 --> 08:34.105
your peace agreement
won't be the only casualty.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.409
You don't need me to
tell you the damage

08:38.476 --> 08:40.744
that your criminal
prosecution will do

08:40.812 --> 08:42.246
to this country.

08:42.246 --> 08:44.381
This country survived
your presidency.

08:44.449 --> 08:47.118
But it won't survive yours.

08:47.185 --> 08:49.754
Me- I inherited
my presidency.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.255
I was never

08:51.256 --> 08:54.324
nearly as popular as you are.

08:54.392 --> 08:58.128
And most of my alleged
misdeeds never made the press.

08:58.196 --> 09:02.199
But if you were
to bare your sins

09:02.266 --> 09:04.568
to the people who put
you in office...?

09:05.937 --> 09:09.639
You are a beacon
of righteousness,

09:09.707 --> 09:13.243
not only for Americans, but
for the rest of the world.

09:13.310 --> 09:15.878
You are the president

09:15.946 --> 09:19.182
who had her own
daughter arrested

09:19.249 --> 09:21.184
rather than see
justice go unserved.

09:21.251 --> 09:23.252
You're a poison.

09:24.521 --> 09:27.822
I never should have
let you to do this.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.660
With due respect,
Madam President,

09:32.727 --> 09:35.729
I- I gave
recommendations,

09:35.797 --> 09:39.433
I made whatever arrangements
needed to be made.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.434
But every decision
was yours.

09:42.502 --> 09:45.036
Let's not pretend
otherwise.

09:47.406 --> 09:49.575
I've-I've studied you

09:49.642 --> 09:51.911
for a number of years, Allison.

09:51.979 --> 09:54.881
I pride myself on being
a good judge of character.

09:54.949 --> 09:56.883
You're a smart woman.

09:56.951 --> 09:59.051
You've always known
what needed to be done

09:59.119 --> 10:00.453
and were willing to do it.

10:00.454 --> 10:01.754
Which is why I know

10:01.755 --> 10:03.655
you will call
Meredith Reed's publisher

10:03.723 --> 10:05.723
and make sure he
kills the story.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.125
I would suggest
you do it now.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.526
You, uh...

10:11.527 --> 10:15.195
You have a signing
ceremony to prepare for.

10:17.031 --> 10:20.600
And I need to go meet
President Suvarov.

10:34.977 --> 10:37.177
Chloe,

10:37.244 --> 10:39.211
you need to see this.

10:39.279 --> 10:40.712
What is it?
I just

10:40.713 --> 10:42.513
tapped into a live feed
from Pillar's team.

10:42.581 --> 10:44.248
This guy was found strung up

10:44.315 --> 10:46.684
and sliced open
in an abandoned building

10:46.751 --> 10:48.953
across from the department
store. He's got Russian papers

10:49.021 --> 10:51.423
on him, but I can't make 'em
out; the rez is too low.

10:51.491 --> 10:54.960
Looks like someone left
a sniper rifle at the scene.

10:55.027 --> 10:56.795
What's the caliber?
Bring it up.

10:56.862 --> 10:59.964
They tagged it
as a.308 Springfield.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.867
That's the gun
that killed Renee.

11:03.935 --> 11:05.269
That's got to
be the shooter.

11:05.270 --> 11:06.904
Jack did this,
and you still think

11:06.971 --> 11:08.072
you're gonna be able

11:08.073 --> 11:09.940
to talk him down?
I gotta try.

11:10.008 --> 11:13.277
Pillar and his people
are just gonna kill him,

11:13.344 --> 11:14.677
and I can't
let that happen.

11:14.678 --> 11:16.345
(beep)

11:16.413 --> 11:18.881
Got a match from the department
store security feed- 82%.

11:18.948 --> 11:21.149
That's the guy
helping Jack?

11:21.217 --> 11:23.151
Yeah, James Ricker-
Ex-Green Beret, Special Ops.

11:23.219 --> 11:25.019
He served with Jack in the Gulf

11:25.087 --> 11:26.687
before Jack was
enlisted by CTU.

11:26.755 --> 11:27.955
Just one problem.

11:27.956 --> 11:29.022
He's dead.

11:29.023 --> 11:30.891
It says he was killed in

11:30.958 --> 11:33.025
a chemical plant explosion
in Basra seven years ago.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.360
Yeah, well, then he must have
a twin who was there

11:35.428 --> 11:37.061
when Jack reversed the ambush.

11:41.832 --> 11:43.399
You better go
back to your station.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.367
Pillar's watchdog
is getting suspicious.

11:46.336 --> 11:47.470
Arlo,

11:47.471 --> 11:48.638
cross-reference
Ricker's photo

11:48.639 --> 11:49.872
with State DMV database.

11:49.873 --> 11:51.874
He must be living
under an alias in the city.

11:51.942 --> 11:53.309
We find Ricker, we find Jack.

11:53.310 --> 11:54.976
Okay.

11:58.347 --> 12:01.115
(phone ringing)

12:01.183 --> 12:02.584
JACK:
Yeah?

12:02.585 --> 12:03.752
You get the location?

12:03.753 --> 12:05.354
<i>RICKER:
You didn't tell me that was</i>

12:05.422 --> 12:07.957
Logan's phone that I was
tracing, Jack. Does it matter?

12:08.025 --> 12:09.358
Yeah, it kind of does.

12:09.359 --> 12:10.925
I think you
know it, too,

12:10.993 --> 12:13.560
or else you would've been
straight with me.

12:13.628 --> 12:16.196
Listen, taking out a bunch
of Russian spooks is one thing,

12:16.264 --> 12:18.264
moving on an ex-president,
that's quite another.

12:18.331 --> 12:20.599
That's a seriously line
you're crossing there, pal.

12:20.666 --> 12:21.933
I know exactly what I'm doing.

12:21.934 --> 12:23.901
Are you gonna give me
the location or not?

12:26.437 --> 12:27.971
Logan's in a vehicle.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.939
He's moving west
from the U.N.

12:30.007 --> 12:33.209
I'm syncing up with the
Secret Service deployment grid.

12:33.277 --> 12:34.777
I'll upload his route
to your tablet.

12:34.845 --> 12:36.345
Hold on.

12:39.848 --> 12:41.282
Okay, I've got it.

12:41.350 --> 12:43.885
Listen, Jack, I sure hope
you know what you're doing,

12:43.953 --> 12:45.251
because this path you're on,

12:45.252 --> 12:47.086
there ain't no
coming back from it.

12:47.154 --> 12:49.623
I wasn't planning
on coming back.

12:49.691 --> 12:51.158
Look, you're right,
you've already done

12:51.159 --> 12:52.993
more than I had a
rit to ask for.

12:53.061 --> 12:55.259
I want you to start erasing
all your connections to me.

12:55.327 --> 12:57.795
Jim...

12:57.863 --> 13:00.698
thanks for everything.
Good-bye.

13:37.461 --> 13:39.962
Oh. Thank you.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.601
Are you sure that's all you
need? Should I call the doctor?

13:45.668 --> 13:47.102
It's just a headache.

13:47.103 --> 13:48.904
I'm fine. Thank you.

13:48.971 --> 13:51.139
You wanted to see me,
Madame President? Yes, Tim.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.874
Please sit down.

13:58.114 --> 14:00.716
You remember the reporter
CTU arrested last night?

14:00.783 --> 14:03.352
Yes, uh, Meredith Reed.

14:03.419 --> 14:05.486
It has been brought
to my attention

14:05.554 --> 14:07.955
that she intends to publish
an unfounded story

14:08.022 --> 14:09.724
regarding Omar Hassan's murder.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.660
What is she
gonna be writing?

14:14.696 --> 14:17.264
I need you to contact the FBI,

14:17.332 --> 14:20.202
<i>have them search
the Sunday Magazine offices,</i>

14:20.269 --> 14:22.103
locate Reed,

14:22.169 --> 14:24.935
and seize whatever evidence
she purports to have.

14:25.003 --> 14:27.802
Um, I-I... I don't understand.

14:27.870 --> 14:30.337
Her allegations are false,
but the allegations alone

14:30.404 --> 14:31.972
could derail the peace process.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.040
Well, even so, Madam President,
you have to be aware,

14:34.108 --> 14:35.541
they'll accuse you
of censoring the press.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.742
Tim, I did not ask
for your counsel.

14:38.810 --> 14:40.743
I know exactly what
I'm ordering you to do,

14:40.810 --> 14:42.744
so please just do it.

14:49.616 --> 14:51.415
Yes, ma'am.

15:22.475 --> 15:24.142
(grunts)

15:35.554 --> 15:36.620
Hey, drop-off
and receiving?

15:36.621 --> 15:38.188
Uh, yeah, straight ahead.

15:38.256 --> 15:40.090
Right there.
Thanks.

15:43.227 --> 15:45.929
Just make sure Duggan knows
he's covering the Logan profile.

15:45.996 --> 15:48.464
Tell him we'll work out
the byline later.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.200
(phone rings)

15:50.267 --> 15:52.502
Editor's desk.
This is Klausner.

15:52.570 --> 15:54.003
REED:
Gary, it's me.

15:54.004 --> 15:55.203
Look, a-are you alone?

15:55.204 --> 15:56.438
Can you speak freely?

15:56.439 --> 15:58.205
Yeah.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.840
Yeah, wh-what's going on?

15:59.908 --> 16:02.441
I don't have a lot of time;
I have a lead on a story.

16:02.509 --> 16:04.743
I'm listening. I have a
digital video recording

16:04.811 --> 16:07.545
indicating that the IRK
terrorists who killed Hassan

16:07.613 --> 16:10.147
were being funded and run
by Russian operatives.

16:10.215 --> 16:11.482
(scoffs)

16:11.483 --> 16:13.184
Uh, y-you sure it's legit?

16:13.251 --> 16:14.752
Where did you get it?

16:14.820 --> 16:16.521
From Jack Bauer.

16:16.588 --> 16:17.755
Bauer?!

16:17.756 --> 16:19.023
The man's a fugitive.

16:19.024 --> 16:21.359
Look, Gary, it's really
not safe for me to talk.

16:21.427 --> 16:22.861
I'll explain more
when I see you.

16:22.928 --> 16:23.928
Can you meet me?

16:23.929 --> 16:25.227
Sure, of course.

16:25.228 --> 16:28.330
All right, that diner
with the coffee you hate.

16:28.397 --> 16:30.732
I can be there
in, uh, 15 minutes.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.301
Okay. And, Gary,
don't tell anyone.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.368
All right?

16:34.369 --> 16:35.436
I got it.

16:35.437 --> 16:37.604
Meredith... be safe.

16:37.672 --> 16:39.572
Yeah. You, too.

17:06.763 --> 17:08.364
There's no need to panic.

17:08.432 --> 17:10.866
NOVAKOVICH: Do you know
what he did to Pavel?

17:10.934 --> 17:13.602
He was beaten savagely,
gutted like a pig.

17:13.670 --> 17:15.103
His men shot dead.

17:15.171 --> 17:17.005
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that,

17:17.071 --> 17:19.573
but we both knew that, uh...

17:19.641 --> 17:22.076
Bauer would be
a difficult problem to solve.

17:22.143 --> 17:24.077
You know what he's doing,
don't you?

17:24.145 --> 17:25.444
He's eliminating
everyone involved,

17:25.445 --> 17:28.380
working his way up-
how long before he gets to me?

17:28.448 --> 17:29.581
That's not
going to happen.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.116
How can you be so sure

17:31.184 --> 17:32.918
Because you
told me yourself

17:32.986 --> 17:34.053
your man would
never talk,

17:34.054 --> 17:35.921
and if that's
true, then...

17:35.989 --> 17:37.489
nobody outside
of your inner circle

17:37.557 --> 17:39.858
can point
the finger at you.

17:39.925 --> 17:42.193
I promise you...

17:42.260 --> 17:45.863
Bauer's never
going to know.

17:45.930 --> 17:49.131
And on the upside,
his recent activities

17:49.199 --> 17:51.233
have given us
a bit of an advantage.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.468
What advantage?

17:53.536 --> 17:56.837
CTU orders concerning him
have been upgraded

17:56.904 --> 17:58.938
to "shoot on sight."

17:59.006 --> 18:01.506
First you have to find him.

18:01.574 --> 18:03.575
They're going to find him;
don't worry.

18:03.643 --> 18:06.410
He can't... he can't stay
under the radar forever.

18:07.445 --> 18:09.780
I'll keep you posted.

18:30.604 --> 18:33.873
(tires screeching)

18:33.941 --> 18:35.542
(horns honking)

18:35.610 --> 18:37.311
(gunfire) DRIVER:
Come in! Come in!

18:37.379 --> 18:39.214
We're under assault!
We are trapped

18:39.282 --> 18:40.782
in the 4th Street
underpass.

18:43.052 --> 18:46.254
DRIV: Unit LEZ-1,
requesting immediate backup.

18:46.322 --> 18:48.290
Both entrances are blocked.
We are boxed in.

18:48.358 --> 18:50.659
Oh, that's... that's Jack Bauer.

18:50.726 --> 18:52.159
That's got to be.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.560
Did you hear what I said?!

18:54.628 --> 18:56.128
That's Jack Bauer!

18:56.196 --> 18:58.164
DRIVER: I repeat: we
need immediate assistance.

18:58.231 --> 18:59.666
Don't just sit there!

18:59.667 --> 19:01.266
He's coming for me!

19:02.569 --> 19:03.836
Sir, stay in the vehicle.

19:03.837 --> 19:05.938
We're armored and
the glass is bulletproof.

19:07.541 --> 19:10.274
(gunfire)

19:10.341 --> 19:12.075
LOGAN:
Close the door!

19:12.143 --> 19:15.343
DRIVER: We are being
attacked by automatic gunfire.

19:24.384 --> 19:25.518
The assailant is masked.

19:25.519 --> 19:27.119
It may be
Jack Bauer.

19:34.193 --> 19:36.460
Close the door! Secure the
vehicle! Close the door!

19:40.665 --> 19:42.165
(grunts)

19:54.175 --> 19:55.675
Kill him!

20:18.697 --> 20:20.730
(Logan gasps)

20:22.934 --> 20:24.937
(gas hissing)

20:28.808 --> 20:30.341
(coughing)

20:30.776 --> 20:32.210
(continues coughing)

20:35.814 --> 20:37.915
(coughing, hacking)

20:48.791 --> 20:50.458
(gagging)

20:50.526 --> 20:54.328
JACK: Mr. President, get up,
or I will kill you right here.

20:54.396 --> 20:56.029
Move!

21:00.599 --> 21:02.734
(gunshot)

21:06.574 --> 21:08.408
Move!

21:20.709 --> 21:22.043
I just got your flash.

21:22.044 --> 21:23.478
What'd you find out
about Ricker?

21:23.546 --> 21:24.879
You were right.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.214
DMV records show Ricker
living in Suffolk County

21:27.282 --> 21:28.683
under the name Simon Strocker.

21:28.684 --> 21:30.818
I tried to confirm,
found out he moved from there

21:30.886 --> 21:32.586
18 months ago,
but he left

21:32.654 --> 21:34.121
a forwarding address
with the postal service-

21:34.122 --> 21:35.956
it's right here in SoHo.

21:37.024 --> 21:39.456
Hey, Devon,
what's going on?

21:39.524 --> 21:41.424
Pillar's people are requesting
backup for the team

21:41.492 --> 21:42.958
in the field.
Why?

21:43.026 --> 21:44.158
You didn't hear?

21:44.159 --> 21:45.826
Jack Bauer just kidnapped
Charles Logan.

21:49.295 --> 21:52.496
How the hell
did he pull that off?

21:52.564 --> 21:54.397
Charles Logan?

21:57.500 --> 22:00.535
I need to hear what's going on
in that room. Follow me.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.243
How far out are you?

22:07.244 --> 22:08.645
We're approaching
the tunnel now.

22:08.646 --> 22:10.680
How the hell did
Secret Service let this happen?

22:10.748 --> 22:12.481
Bauer hit the town car
with tear gas.

22:12.549 --> 22:14.350
The agents were too
incapacitated to pursue.

22:14.417 --> 22:15.851
PD's got the
tunnel locked down.

22:15.852 --> 22:17.285
I'm working on getting
you schematics.

22:17.286 --> 22:19.020
Hurry up.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.490
(tires squealing)

22:25.728 --> 22:27.929
CTU! Make a hole!

22:34.204 --> 22:36.205
(man coughing)

22:40.610 --> 22:43.279
Where did Bauer take
President Logan?

22:43.347 --> 22:44.680
I don't know.

22:44.681 --> 22:45.915
(coughing continues)

22:45.916 --> 22:47.218
You must have
seen something.

22:47.219 --> 22:50.087
(coughing)

22:50.155 --> 22:51.789
me on- tell me
you saw something.

22:51.856 --> 22:53.224
Sorry, sir.
Nothing?

22:53.225 --> 22:55.225
No one saw
anything.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.503
Eden, they went through
an underground service gate.

23:09.571 --> 23:10.737
I need those schematics.

23:10.738 --> 23:11.939
Sending them to you now.

23:11.940 --> 23:13.941
Go.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.984
All right, Kirsch,
take the corridor.

23:23.051 --> 23:24.318
Brown, you're down there.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.553
Ames, you're with me.

23:25.554 --> 23:27.121
Remember, unless it poses
an immediate threat

23:27.189 --> 23:28.956
to President Logan,
you shoot Bauer on sight,

23:29.024 --> 23:30.224
and you shoot to kill.

23:30.225 --> 23:31.891
Let's go.

23:33.961 --> 23:36.029
(Logan panting)

23:36.097 --> 23:38.099
Through here.

23:39.468 --> 23:41.068
(grunts)

23:42.338 --> 23:43.772
Look at me.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.908
I said look at me!
(whimpers)

23:45.976 --> 23:47.943
You're going to tell me
everything I want to know.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.779
Jack, you're making a mistake.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.081
Don't you even try and pretend
you're not a part of this.

23:52.149 --> 23:54.383
I found the man
who killed Renee Walker:

23:54.451 --> 23:56.018
the Russian operative
Pavel Tokarev.

23:56.086 --> 23:57.320
I got his cell phone.

23:57.321 --> 23:58.721
The last call he
got was from you.

23:58.722 --> 23:59.922
I know how it looks.

23:59.923 --> 24:01.357
You got to let me
explain. Explain what?

24:01.358 --> 24:03.359
That you sent for him
to kill me?

24:03.427 --> 24:05.093
You sent him to
kill me, right?

24:05.159 --> 24:06.727
Yes! Damn it, yes!

24:06.794 --> 24:08.462
Why did you take out a hit
on Renee Walker?

24:08.529 --> 24:09.930
I had nothing
to do with that.

24:09.998 --> 24:11.798
I was brought in
after that happened.

24:11.866 --> 24:13.066
Who brought you in?

24:13.067 --> 24:14.600
President Taylor
needed my help

24:14.668 --> 24:16.402
to bring the Russians
back to the table.

24:16.469 --> 24:17.903
I- I called my
sources in Moscow.

24:17.904 --> 24:19.871
They told me that people
in their government

24:19.939 --> 24:21.907
were behind Hassan's
assassination.

24:21.974 --> 24:24.409
I- I told the Russian delegation
I had evidence of that fact

24:24.477 --> 24:25.678
and the names of
everybody involved.

24:25.679 --> 24:27.046
It was just to keep
them at the conference.

24:27.047 --> 24:28.214
What evidence?
What evidence?!

24:28.215 --> 24:29.382
It doesn't exist.

24:29.383 --> 24:30.650
I was playing poker.

24:30.651 --> 24:32.218
It was a bluff. It worked.

24:32.286 --> 24:34.587
It kept Taylor's peace agreement
on the table, but you...

24:34.654 --> 24:36.221
You were determined
to screw things up.

24:36.288 --> 24:37.989
And to... Oh! Oh!

24:38.057 --> 24:40.758
Ow! Easy. Jack!
Jack! Jack! I admit.

24:40.825 --> 24:42.360
I admit,
I was part of the cover-up,

24:42.427 --> 24:43.995
but I'm not part
of the Russian conspiracy.

24:44.062 --> 24:46.296
I had nothing to do with
the terrorist attack

24:46.364 --> 24:47.730
or your friend's death.

24:47.731 --> 24:50.666
I- I... I'm... I'm not
the bad guy here.

24:50.734 --> 24:52.668
Okay, but you know who is.

24:52.735 --> 24:55.003
You know the name of the person
inside the Russian government

24:55.070 --> 24:56.670
who's giving the orders.
I want that name.

24:56.738 --> 24:58.171
Jack...
Give me the name!

24:58.172 --> 25:00.240
Jack... You got five
seconds before I put a bullet

25:00.308 --> 25:01.775
through your head. No! No!
You don't have to do that.

25:01.843 --> 25:02.976
Five...
I'll tell you.

25:02.977 --> 25:04.745
four... three...
Mikhail Novakovich.

25:04.813 --> 25:06.680
He's the head of the
Russian delegation.

25:06.748 --> 25:08.015
He's been trying

25:08.016 --> 25:09.950
to kill the peace treaty
from the start.

25:10.017 --> 25:12.286
(panting)
You're lying.

25:12.353 --> 25:14.354
No! No! No! I'm not lying
to you! No! No! No! No!

25:14.422 --> 25:16.056
You got my call
from Pavel's phone.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.390
You check the
previous calls.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.091
There's a dozen more
from Novakovich.

25:19.159 --> 25:20.426
I'm telling you.

25:20.427 --> 25:21.526
He's the one you want.

25:21.527 --> 25:22.560
(door thuds open)
Shut up!

25:22.561 --> 25:23.995
(muffled groan)
Say another word,

25:23.996 --> 25:25.529
and I'll drop you
right here.

25:34.836 --> 25:36.805
(Logan gasping anxiously)

25:36.872 --> 25:38.807
Get on your knees.

25:38.875 --> 25:41.010
Oh, no. Please.

25:41.078 --> 25:42.279
Don't shoot me, Jack.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.316
If I was gonna kill you,
you'd already be dead.

25:45.384 --> 25:47.385
(choking)

25:51.959 --> 25:53.826
(gags)

26:18.918 --> 26:20.985
PILLAR: Bauer was
just here- find him!

26:21.053 --> 26:23.755
Mr. President?

26:23.823 --> 26:25.457
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

26:25.525 --> 26:28.592
Eden, I need a med unit
at the 49th junction.

26:28.659 --> 26:29.826
On its way.

26:29.827 --> 26:32.159
Is it Bauer?

26:32.226 --> 26:33.593
PILLAR:
No. It's the president.

26:33.594 --> 26:34.961
He's unconscious.

26:34.962 --> 26:37.396
Bauer escaped. I'm gonna need
you to redirect the pursuit.

26:37.464 --> 26:38.664
I'll stay with the president.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.432
Understood.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.034
They still might
catch up to him.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.935
They haven't yet.
Do you have Ricker's file?

26:45.003 --> 26:47.370
Yeah, including
his current address.

26:47.438 --> 26:50.006
I'm sending it
to you now.

26:50.073 --> 26:51.436
How are you planning
to handle this?

26:51.437 --> 26:53.404
We can't send any tactical units
to pick this guy up

26:53.472 --> 26:54.772
without Pillar finding out
about it.

26:54.773 --> 26:55.773
I'm not using
any of them.

26:55.774 --> 26:57.608
Then who are you
going to get?

26:57.676 --> 26:59.277
All of our agents are fully
deployed in the field.

26:59.344 --> 27:01.179
There's nobody to send.

27:01.247 --> 27:03.249
There's one.

27:05.318 --> 27:07.319
(sighs)

27:21.390 --> 27:22.591
Ms. O'Brian?

27:22.592 --> 27:23.825
Ms. O'Brian?!

27:23.826 --> 27:25.460
I just saw the
flash from division.

27:25.527 --> 27:26.793
They approved
your request

27:26.794 --> 27:28.494
to release Agent Ortiz
into your custody?

27:28.561 --> 27:30.027
Yeah, I'm in a hurry, so...

27:30.028 --> 27:31.531
What do you think
you're doing?

27:31.599 --> 27:33.701
He's a non-cooperative witness
who is facing federal charges.

27:33.769 --> 27:35.002
In case you haven't noticed,

27:35.003 --> 27:36.670
I'm still in charge
of UN Security,

27:36.737 --> 27:38.338
and you've taken away
all my resources.

27:38.405 --> 27:40.206
And not that
it's any of your business,

27:40.274 --> 27:42.241
but Agent Ortiz designed
the entire UN operation.

27:42.309 --> 27:44.143
The signing is in less
than two hours.

27:44.211 --> 27:46.445
His assistance
in the field is vital.

27:46.513 --> 27:48.814
I'm going to have to
clear this with Pillar.

27:48.882 --> 27:51.450
Do what you want, but to me,
you have bigger problems,

27:51.517 --> 27:53.051
like not finding Jack Bauer.

27:55.087 --> 27:57.489
(sighs)

28:13.574 --> 28:15.809
(sighs)

28:15.877 --> 28:17.711
Are you Meredith?

28:17.779 --> 28:20.480
Yes.

28:20.548 --> 28:22.681
There's a Gary Klausner
on the phone for you.

28:22.749 --> 28:24.317
It's up
by the cashier.

28:24.385 --> 28:26.387
Thank you.

28:31.063 --> 28:33.064
Thanks.

28:34.066 --> 28:35.299
Where are you?

28:35.300 --> 28:37.702
Meredith, the FBI is here.

28:37.770 --> 28:39.470
Showed up before I could leave.

28:39.538 --> 28:41.206
They're looking for you,
questioning everyone,

28:41.273 --> 28:42.507
including me.

28:42.508 --> 28:44.175
You didn't tell them anything,
did you?

28:44.242 --> 28:45.409
Of course not.

28:45.410 --> 28:46.610
But they've got
an executive order

28:46.611 --> 28:48.012
from the president.

28:48.013 --> 28:49.680
They say you're in possession
of materials that pose

28:49.747 --> 28:51.048
a national security risk.

28:51.049 --> 28:52.316
It's a cover-up, Gary.

28:52.317 --> 28:54.719
The White House is trying
to suppress the story.

28:54.787 --> 28:55.953
You can't let them.

28:55.954 --> 28:58.356
Look, until we clear this up,

28:58.424 --> 29:00.494
you have to protect
that evidence.

29:00.562 --> 29:02.731
I told them I haven't had
any contact with you,

29:02.798 --> 29:04.734
but for all I know,
they're tracing this call.

29:04.802 --> 29:06.470
You better get the hell out
of there.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.006
And go where?

29:08.073 --> 29:10.074
Mr. Klausner.

29:10.142 --> 29:12.009
We said no communication
outside of our presence.

29:12.077 --> 29:14.678
I- I I'm canceling
an appointment.

29:14.746 --> 29:16.480
Gary, they're going
to bury the truth.

29:16.548 --> 29:17.982
Not if I can help it.

29:17.983 --> 29:19.751
I'll-try to put a call in
to Ed Sampson

29:19.818 --> 29:20.985
at the Justice Department, but

29:20.986 --> 29:22.186
until then, lay low.

29:22.187 --> 29:23.354
Now go.

29:23.355 --> 29:25.123
Okay.

29:47.652 --> 29:48.986
Let's go.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.153
Where are we going?

29:50.154 --> 29:51.455
I have to go to
the U.N., and

29:51.456 --> 29:52.522
division has given you

29:52.523 --> 29:53.692
a temporary furlough
into my custody.

29:53.693 --> 29:55.795
Since you had earlier
command of UN security,

29:55.862 --> 29:57.596
I'm gonna need your help
coordinating protocols

29:57.664 --> 29:59.164
and deployment for
the signing ceremony.

29:59.232 --> 30:01.466
And Pillar's okay with this?

30:01.534 --> 30:03.869
I'm still provisional
Director of Operations.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.303
I don't need his consent.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.171
So, are you coming,
or would you rather

30:07.239 --> 30:08.874
wait here for your
federal prosecution?

30:08.942 --> 30:10.343
(scoffs)
Let's go.

30:12.981 --> 30:14.982
I'll take him from here.

30:16.585 --> 30:18.586
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

30:18.654 --> 30:21.289
Yeah.

30:22.324 --> 30:24.092
You were right
about Jack.

30:24.159 --> 30:25.927
He is working
with somebody.

30:28.731 --> 30:29.797
It's James Ricker,

30:29.798 --> 30:31.132
ex-CIA Op.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.669
We found him living
at a place on Mercer Street

30:33.736 --> 30:34.970
under the alias
Simon Strocker.

30:34.971 --> 30:36.238
Maybe he's still
with the company.

30:36.239 --> 30:38.307
No. I checked with Langley.
He was listed as deceased.

30:38.375 --> 30:40.843
More than likely, he's gone
into business for himself,

30:40.911 --> 30:42.679
dealing arms or intel.
In any case,

30:42.747 --> 30:44.114
he's not going to be happy
we tracked him down.

30:44.115 --> 30:45.616
Wait a second.

30:45.684 --> 30:47.185
Why are you telling me this?

30:47.252 --> 30:49.220
I need you to talk to him.

30:49.288 --> 30:51.690
Get him to tell us
where Jack is.

30:51.758 --> 30:54.026
Are you good with that, or
have you still not taken sides?

30:54.093 --> 30:56.696
I want to expose this cover-up
as much as you. I'm in.

30:56.764 --> 30:58.797
Good. Log sheets

30:58.865 --> 31:00.565
will show you
accompanying me to the UN.

31:00.633 --> 31:02.734
I've secured you a separate
vehicle waiting at the gate.

31:02.802 --> 31:04.537
Is there any more
intel on Jack?

31:04.605 --> 31:05.906
Has he resurfaced again?

31:05.907 --> 31:08.008
Yeah, you could say that.

31:10.541 --> 31:12.474
Sir, I just
received word.

31:12.540 --> 31:14.973
President Suvarov's plane has
touched down at Kennedy Airport.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.640
Tell Ivan to bring
the car around.

31:17.708 --> 31:20.172
I want to be at the UN
when the president arrives.

31:26.577 --> 31:28.579
(phone ringing)

31:47.392 --> 31:49.360
Where's Novakovich?

31:49.427 --> 31:51.895
I'm not going to
ask you again. 11th.

31:51.963 --> 31:53.130
11th floor, suite 1170.

31:53.131 --> 31:54.564
How do I get up there?

31:54.565 --> 31:56.699
Secure elevator
inside of garage.

31:56.767 --> 31:58.233
Where's your keycard?
I don't have one.

31:58.301 --> 32:01.235
(grunting)

32:01.303 --> 32:02.470
Where is your keycard?

32:02.471 --> 32:03.938
I don't have one, I swear.

32:04.006 --> 32:06.406
His personal guards have them
at elevator.

32:06.474 --> 32:07.474
How many?
Two.

32:07.475 --> 32:08.575
And upstairs?

32:08.576 --> 32:10.076
One outside the suite,
two inside.

32:10.144 --> 32:11.445
Another by elevator.

32:11.446 --> 32:12.612
Where else?

32:12.613 --> 32:13.814
Where else?!

32:13.815 --> 32:15.482
That's all.
That's all I know.

32:16.951 --> 32:19.386
(grunting)

32:46.849 --> 32:48.282
(bell chimes)

32:53.319 --> 32:55.621
(grunting)

32:57.324 --> 32:59.258
(blade slashing)

33:02.495 --> 33:04.329
(bell dings)

33:06.965 --> 33:08.633
(groans quietly)

33:37.846 --> 33:40.213
Do you really need an arsenal?

33:40.281 --> 33:42.081
Better to have
it than to not.

33:42.149 --> 33:44.216
Besides, Ricker's
a trained killer.

33:44.284 --> 33:45.818
He's gone to a
lot of trouble

33:45.886 --> 33:47.386
to stay off the grid.
Fair enough.

33:47.454 --> 33:49.421
I also have to consider
the possibility

33:49.489 --> 33:50.789
that Jack's with him.

33:50.790 --> 33:53.192
Listen, Chloe,

33:53.260 --> 33:54.660
I can't be worried
about Jack anymore,

33:54.661 --> 33:56.630
not after what you told
me he did to Logan.

33:56.697 --> 33:59.133
Obviously, Logan's
part of the conspiracy.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.935
He terrorized a tunnel
full of commuters

34:01.002 --> 34:02.470
with automatic
weapon fire.

34:02.538 --> 34:04.272
He shot Seet Service agents.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.943
He shot to wound.

34:07.010 --> 34:09.879
He's careless, and he
only cares about revenge.

34:09.947 --> 34:12.047
Does that sound like
the man you know?

34:12.116 --> 34:13.650
Like the man
you're trying to save?

34:13.717 --> 34:17.487
This is about exposing
the Russians' cover-up.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.223
It's not about Jack.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.292
Are you sure about that?

34:21.360 --> 34:23.094
Because if
Jack's there,

34:23.161 --> 34:26.130
and he makes any move
other than complete surrender...

34:27.533 --> 34:29.001
...I'm putting him down.

34:30.704 --> 34:31.971
You still want me to go?

34:31.972 --> 34:34.373
I don't really have a choice.

34:36.876 --> 34:39.378
Whatever happens,
call me at the U.N.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.545
You got it.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.579
(engine starts)

34:50.882 --> 34:52.449
You'll approach
the rostrum

34:52.516 --> 34:54.715
immediately prior to the signing
ceremony, and take a seat here

34:54.782 --> 34:56.983
in position three,
next to your mother.

34:57.050 --> 34:58.484
I'm honored.

34:58.485 --> 35:00.085
But is that appropriate?

35:00.153 --> 35:01.954
I may be her daughter,

35:02.022 --> 35:03.956
but I don't have any
official role in government.

35:04.024 --> 35:05.591
(knocking on door)

35:07.360 --> 35:08.927
Excuse me.

35:08.995 --> 35:12.463
Ms. Hassan, there's a call
on your father's secure line-

35:12.530 --> 35:13.830
a woman demanding to speak
with your mother.

35:13.831 --> 35:15.164
She's in a meeting.

35:15.165 --> 35:16.666
That's what I said,
but this woman

35:16.733 --> 35:18.667
is quite insistent.
Who is she?

35:18.735 --> 35:19.868
She won't say.

35:19.869 --> 35:20.969
We're done,
Ms. Hassan.

35:20.970 --> 35:22.503
I'll see you in
the staging area.

35:22.571 --> 35:23.904
Thank you.

35:23.905 --> 35:25.138
Line two.

35:25.139 --> 35:26.473
Thank you.

35:26.474 --> 35:27.907
Hello. Who is this?

35:27.975 --> 35:30.677
Ah. Is this Kayla?

35:30.745 --> 35:32.011
Who are you?

35:32.012 --> 35:33.513
Sorry, um...

35:33.581 --> 35:35.281
my name is Meredith Reed.

35:35.349 --> 35:37.550
I need to speak to your mother.

35:37.617 --> 35:39.185
I know who you are.

35:39.253 --> 35:40.887
What do you think
you're doing calling here?

35:40.955 --> 35:42.422
I- I know I'm the
last person that

35:42.423 --> 35:44.257
either of you wants
to talk to right now...

35:44.325 --> 35:46.359
You're right.
I'm hanging up now.

35:46.426 --> 35:49.462
No, please, please, your mother
needs to hear what I have to say

35:49.530 --> 35:51.332
before she signs the agreement
with President Taylor.

35:51.400 --> 35:55.302
What is it that is so important?

35:55.369 --> 35:58.271
I- I'm sorry, I need to speak
to your mother directly.

35:58.339 --> 36:00.540
Haven't you caused
my mother enough pain?

36:00.608 --> 36:02.208
Leave us alone!

36:02.276 --> 36:04.911
It's about the people who
really murdered your father.

36:06.113 --> 36:08.514
What are you talking about?

36:08.581 --> 36:10.549
We know who was responsible.

36:10.617 --> 36:13.185
What you don't know is,
those people were working

36:13.253 --> 36:15.787
under the orders
of Russian agents.

36:15.855 --> 36:17.722
What?!

36:20.793 --> 36:23.227
Hello?
When your mother gets back

36:23.295 --> 36:24.828
from her meetings,
have her call me

36:24.896 --> 36:26.496
at this number- can
you take this down?

36:26.564 --> 36:28.098
(panting)

36:29.734 --> 36:31.201
Go ahead.

36:31.269 --> 36:35.038
It's 212-555-0121.

36:35.106 --> 36:37.507
I'll explain everything
to her then.

36:37.575 --> 36:39.075
Wait...!

36:46.316 --> 36:47.582
Meredith Reed?

36:47.583 --> 36:49.183
FBI. Get your hands where

36:49.251 --> 36:51.085
we can see 'em. Wait,
wait, what-what is this?

36:51.153 --> 36:52.553
What is this?

36:52.554 --> 36:53.787
Wait. Wait.

36:53.788 --> 36:55.589
You have no right
to take that.

36:55.657 --> 36:56.923
I- I haven't done
anything wrong.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.625
What is this?

37:00.127 --> 37:01.895
You're under arrest.

37:01.962 --> 37:03.897
I
- I've done nothing wrong. Let's go.

37:03.965 --> 37:06.133
I've done nothing wrong!

37:14.977 --> 37:16.744
(knocking on door)

37:18.781 --> 37:19.980
Yes?

37:19.981 --> 37:21.514
Mr. Woods, ma'am.

37:24.252 --> 37:26.753
I've just received word
from the FBI.

37:26.821 --> 37:28.588
Reed is in custody,

37:28.656 --> 37:30.823
and they've secured
a data card they found on her.

37:30.890 --> 37:34.161
(sighs)

37:34.229 --> 37:37.098
No one sees what's on it but me.

37:37.166 --> 37:38.667
Understood.

37:49.210 --> 37:51.111
MAN:
Sir, we'll take it from here.

37:51.178 --> 37:52.812
No, you won't
- I'm riding with him to the hospital.

37:52.879 --> 37:53.979
(clears throat)

37:53.980 --> 37:55.446
Give him some space.

37:56.648 --> 37:59.449
(weakly):
Nova... Novakov...

37:59.517 --> 38:01.250
Nova...

38:01.318 --> 38:03.285
Novakovich.

38:03.353 --> 38:04.786
Warn...

38:04.854 --> 38:07.488
Bauer knows.

38:08.856 --> 38:10.690
Warn Novakovich
Bauer's coming after him.

38:10.757 --> 38:13.125
PARAMEDIC: Sir, we gotta
get going. Not yet. Just do

38:13.193 --> 38:14.793
what you can for him here.
Understood.

38:21.665 --> 38:23.832
(phone ringing)

38:26.402 --> 38:28.569
(ringing continues)

38:35.977 --> 38:38.145
(ringing continues)

38:45.292 --> 38:48.094
(ringing continues)

38:49.664 --> 38:51.065
Yes?

38:51.133 --> 38:53.405
Mr. Novakovich?

38:53.472 --> 38:55.307
Hello? Hello?

38:55.375 --> 38:56.942
It's Berkov.

38:57.010 --> 38:58.310
We've been attacked.

38:58.311 --> 39:00.445
It was Bauer.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.213
Where's Novakovich?

39:02.280 --> 39:03.914
He's dead.

39:03.982 --> 39:05.749
Everyone is dead.

39:09.020 --> 39:11.756
Berkov, did Novakovich
say anything to Bauer?

39:11.823 --> 39:14.192
I need an ambulance.

39:14.260 --> 39:15.727
Just answer my question.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.528
What did Novakovich
say to Bauer?

39:17.596 --> 39:19.931
Nothing. Bauer
just came in shooting.

39:19.998 --> 39:22.166
But he was bleeding.

39:22.234 --> 39:24.602
I think he was wounded
by one of the guards.

39:24.670 --> 39:28.072
All right, sit tight;
an ambulance is on the way.

39:31.477 --> 39:33.678
Go.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.514
(quietly):
Novakovich is dead.

39:36.582 --> 39:39.851
Bauer killed him,
killed all of his men...

39:39.919 --> 39:41.920
(continues
indistinctly)

40:04.439 --> 40:06.607
(phone ringing)

40:09.311 --> 40:10.511
Yes?

40:10.512 --> 40:11.946
LOGAN (clears throat):
Yuri.

40:12.014 --> 40:13.714
Charles Logan.

40:13.782 --> 40:16.017
I was under the impression
you were going to be

40:16.085 --> 40:17.485
at the heliport for my arrival.

40:17.486 --> 40:19.386
Yes, well...
(raspy chuckle)

40:19.454 --> 40:21.956
...I ran into some trouble.

40:22.023 --> 40:23.925
I'm afraid I have bad news.

40:23.992 --> 40:26.461
It appears that
Mikhail Novakovich

40:26.529 --> 40:28.763
was just murdered
by Jack Bauer.

40:28.831 --> 40:31.165
What?! Yeah, and,
uh, Bauer learned

40:31.233 --> 40:33.668
that, uh, Novakovich
was responsible

40:33.735 --> 40:35.303
for ordering and...

40:35.371 --> 40:39.574
coordinating Omar Hassan's
assassination, as well as

40:39.641 --> 40:41.142
the rest of Samir's activities.

40:41.209 --> 40:42.977
Where would he get that idea?

40:43.045 --> 40:44.478
From me.

40:44.479 --> 40:46.648
The lunatic was
gonna kill me, Yuri.

40:46.715 --> 40:47.849
What can I say?

40:47.850 --> 40:49.351
Think of it as, uh,

40:49.418 --> 40:51.820
sacrificing
a rook for a king.

40:51.888 --> 40:54.356
Then Bauer has no idea

40:54.424 --> 40:56.993
that Novakovich was operating
under my orders?

40:57.061 --> 40:58.228
None.

40:58.229 --> 41:00.630
Uh, according to a witness,

41:00.698 --> 41:04.100
Mikhail didn't have a chance to
give you up, even he wanted to.

41:04.167 --> 41:07.635
As far as, uh,
Bauer is concerned...

41:07.703 --> 41:09.870
the trail ended
with Novakovich.

41:09.938 --> 41:11.504
And he's being hunted

41:11.571 --> 41:14.306
by every law enforcement
agency in the city.

41:14.374 --> 41:16.741
And I've-I've heard
that, uh... (chuckles)

41:16.809 --> 41:18.643
he's been wounded.

41:18.711 --> 41:22.315
unded- there is nothing more
dangerous than a wounded animal.

41:22.382 --> 41:24.016
Look, if you're
so worried about Bauer,

41:24.084 --> 41:25.718
you never should
have given the order

41:25.785 --> 41:27.186
to kill Renee Walker.

41:27.187 --> 41:29.821
That's what stirred up
the hornet's nest.

41:29.889 --> 41:33.224
If I had known that
yowere going to find out

41:33.292 --> 41:35.360
about our activities
and use that information

41:35.427 --> 41:36.728
to blackmail me

41:36.729 --> 41:38.529
into signing
Taylor's peace agreement,

41:38.597 --> 41:40.999
I wouldn't have bothered
with the woman.

41:41.067 --> 41:43.035
Water under the bridge, Yuri.

41:43.102 --> 41:46.471
I needed an opportunity
to put myself back in the game.

41:46.539 --> 41:49.341
I'm sorry that it has
come at your expense.

41:49.409 --> 41:52.044
You wouldn't begrudge
an old friend

41:52.111 --> 41:55.447
his second chance in the sun.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.715
LOGAN (over radio):
All right, then, I will, uh,

41:57.783 --> 41:59.951
I will meet you
at the United Nations...

42:00.019 --> 42:02.020
(clears throat)
as soon as I can.

42:04.256 --> 42:06.257
