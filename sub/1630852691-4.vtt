02:51.583 --> 02:54.166
Mads, can I show you something?

02:54.833 --> 02:55.833
What's up?

02:57.375 --> 02:58.375
Check this out.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
What is it?

03:02.458 --> 03:07.208
I think Hans pushed it
into my neck right before he died.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.166
I just know it's connected to him.

03:16.416 --> 03:17.875
Okay. Come on.

03:21.541 --> 03:24.666
It was glowing
with a blue, flashing light.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.541
Almost like a pulse.

03:29.875 --> 03:30.875
Okay.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.166
Ouch.

03:41.333 --> 03:42.958
Okay. Check it out.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.583
It reacts to blood.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.416
Well, it reacts to organic matter.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.500
Give it to me.

04:12.666 --> 04:13.958
What is that sound?

04:21.583 --> 04:22.458
What are you doing?

04:23.916 --> 04:26.291
The vibrations interact with the light.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.416
Perhaps there is a pattern.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.625
Like a message?

04:32.208 --> 04:33.208
Maybe.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.750
-Can you decipher it?
-Not if you keep interrupting.

04:39.291 --> 04:42.208
Shut the door!

04:42.291 --> 04:46.583
-Are you having a party?
-No, we're exposing a global conspiracy.

04:46.666 --> 04:49.750
-It covers the entire universe--
-Elvis!

04:49.833 --> 04:50.916
-Yes.
-The door.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.416
So you'd better…

04:53.916 --> 04:55.166
Shut the door.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.125
What's up? What are you doing?

05:04.541 --> 05:05.500
Give me a second.

05:07.416 --> 05:08.750
-What's up?
-Get out.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.125
-What?
-Give me a second! Out.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.791
-Okay. Could you…
-Sure.

05:15.208 --> 05:16.625
Come on. Let's go outside.

05:16.708 --> 05:18.833
I need to be able to concentrate, okay?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.541
-Relax.
-Shut up. Just come along.

05:25.375 --> 05:26.833
We're going. Come on.

05:48.416 --> 05:51.625
Maybe I should see
if that girl's still nearby.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.708
Don't you remember her name?

06:10.833 --> 06:12.625
I really like her.

06:12.708 --> 06:13.958
-That's great.
-Sure.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.125
Come on. Hurry up!

06:18.958 --> 06:22.250
I've run it through several algorithms,
and it seems pretty clear.

06:25.083 --> 06:28.250
-It's a number combination.
-Like a time? Or a date?

06:28.333 --> 06:30.583
-How so?
-Maybe somebody's birthday?

06:30.666 --> 06:32.583
A birthday ball. Congratulations.

06:32.666 --> 06:34.666
Could each number represent a letter?

06:34.750 --> 06:37.166
-What if…
-Emma, don't.

06:37.250 --> 06:39.458
-Let me explain.
-It can be anything.

06:39.541 --> 06:40.750
Outside of time and space.

06:43.916 --> 06:46.541
Exactly. It's outside time and space.

06:47.416 --> 06:48.625
The ball sends a signal,

06:48.708 --> 06:52.750
a sound wave we can't detect,
but the microphone can. Listen up. If we…

06:55.541 --> 06:57.375
If we move the mic,

06:58.541 --> 07:01.166
it doesn't detect the signal,
but if we point it

07:02.375 --> 07:05.458
exactly in a compass direction
of 170 degrees…

07:07.958 --> 07:09.625
170 degrees due south.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.708
That's the direction of the signal.

07:14.916 --> 07:18.458
What's at 170 degrees due south?
It's the old sawmill.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.791
Just outside Middelbo.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.625
Cool! That's my boy! Yes!

07:27.541 --> 07:28.375
That's insane!

07:28.458 --> 07:30.916
-Mads, this is so important.
-Let's go there.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.125
No.

07:33.625 --> 07:35.625
Elvis and I will go there.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.083
Super. That's the plan.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.333
I need to know why this happened to me.

07:42.416 --> 07:44.750
It didn't happen to you.
It happened to us.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.666
And I've decided
that Elvis and I check it out first.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.125
Okay?

07:52.666 --> 07:53.666
Sure.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.750
I'll figure something else out.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.125
Lukas?

08:46.166 --> 08:47.166
Hello?

08:50.916 --> 08:52.250
What are you doing here?

08:53.625 --> 08:55.000
I told you to stay away.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.083
Yes, but something happened.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.416
I think you can help.

09:00.041 --> 09:02.208
-What happened?
-I found something.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.625
-What?
-It's nothing.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.583
What are you doing here?

09:11.666 --> 09:13.875
-Did you bring anyone with you?
-No.

09:13.958 --> 09:16.000
Sorry, it's really nothing.

09:16.666 --> 09:18.208
Emma wanted me to see you.

09:22.958 --> 09:23.958
See me?

09:26.708 --> 09:30.041
-He can help.
-I'm sorry, but we're wasting your time.

09:30.916 --> 09:32.791
It's nothing. Come on, Emma.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.208
Sorry.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.166
What are you doing?
Why are you suddenly here?

09:47.250 --> 09:49.250
-You're ruining--
-When did you meet him?

09:50.083 --> 09:51.791
-After all the stuff with Hans.
-How?

09:51.875 --> 09:54.250
-What do you mean?
-Who found whom?

09:54.333 --> 09:55.416
Does it matter?

09:57.791 --> 10:01.208
Hans dies in mysterious circumstances
and plants a fucking ball in your neck.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.791
Then a new guy shows up offering to help.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.166
He's from Astraeus.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.125
They'll do anything
to get our information.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.666
To know what I know.

10:10.458 --> 10:13.041
-How much did you tell him?
-Listen to me.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.083
He's one of them. Like Hans.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.500
-Okay.
-He was the one at the house.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.000
Can the little choir boy
run 300,000 kilometers per second?

10:20.083 --> 10:22.750
Shut up!
You think everything's about Astraeus.

10:22.833 --> 10:25.208
And you think
everyone's from space, all right?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.708
I'm not just pulling it out of my ass!
It's facts, data, and research, okay?

10:28.791 --> 10:31.208
-Why shouldn't I believe him?
-Why?

10:31.291 --> 10:33.125
He shows up when you need his help.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.791
He offers to help you
understand your current situation.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.708
He lives on the docks
like he's fucking Batman.

10:41.125 --> 10:43.041
-Batman lives in a cave.
-Yeah, thanks.

10:44.375 --> 10:45.875
It sounds really stupid.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.291
Especially when you put it like that.
It's just…

10:52.208 --> 10:53.166
What?

10:54.125 --> 10:55.791
What if I was chosen for a reason?

10:58.583 --> 11:00.833
Why do you think
he hid the ball in my neck?

11:02.416 --> 11:04.458
You were chosen because you were there.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.375
Hans needed to get
the ball out of the house.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.416
The ball was the letter.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.000
You were the envelope.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.458
Okay?

11:16.041 --> 11:18.541
Let's go see the others
before you fuck it up even more.

11:19.041 --> 11:19.916
Frederik.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.125
Where are you going?

11:27.208 --> 11:28.791
I'm going to work.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.000
Give me the ball!

11:31.083 --> 11:32.083
Emma?

11:33.375 --> 11:34.375
Emma.

11:37.625 --> 11:38.833
I can do it.

11:59.791 --> 12:00.791
Emma?

12:01.916 --> 12:06.291
-Sorry, I'll be quick.
-No. Could you please come with me?

12:07.833 --> 12:10.750
We're running routine checks
on all new shipyard employees.

12:10.833 --> 12:13.833
It's super quick.
Then you're free to go again.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.333
What kind of routine check?

12:17.958 --> 12:18.958
This way.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.708
Just a standard
health and background check

12:21.791 --> 12:24.208
required by our insurers
for all employees.

12:24.791 --> 12:25.791
There you go.

12:29.208 --> 12:30.875
Please take a seat.

12:39.625 --> 12:40.625
Ouch.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.125
Please fill this in.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.458
Put it on the table when you're done.

12:57.375 --> 12:58.375
Okay.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.708
"Briefly describe yourself."

13:38.666 --> 13:39.666
Hi, Mom.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.250
-Hi, honey.
-What are you doing?

13:43.708 --> 13:45.041
Where have you been?

13:46.083 --> 13:47.541
Mom, what's going on?

13:48.041 --> 13:49.041
I was just thinking…

13:49.750 --> 13:53.041
You always say
that you don't feel you belong here.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.250
That you'd have liked
to grow up somewhere else.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.666
Maybe in Copenhagen.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.333
And?

14:00.708 --> 14:01.791
Sit down, please.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.875
I've called a real estate agent.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.083
He's showing us a handful of apartments.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.000
In Copenhagen.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.958
-When?
-Tomorrow.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.625
-We can't.
-It's not set in stone.

14:25.708 --> 14:29.250
Not yet, but if we like one of them, then…

14:29.833 --> 14:32.416
Mom, I have a job. I have things to do.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.583
But I'd like us to see the apartments.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.833
It'll be good for us.

14:42.375 --> 14:45.458
-I understand if it feels a bit sudden.
-A bit?

14:47.041 --> 14:49.083
Yes, but this is what we're doing.

14:49.166 --> 14:51.375
-I don't want to.
-That's not up to you--

14:51.458 --> 14:53.041
-I'd like to stay here.
-No.

14:53.541 --> 14:56.708
-That's not your decision.
-It'll be as I say!

15:38.666 --> 15:39.833
Hi.

15:39.916 --> 15:40.958
No.

15:41.916 --> 15:43.458
-That's cool.
-What is?

15:44.791 --> 15:45.666
Just…

15:46.791 --> 15:47.791
You know.

15:48.708 --> 15:51.125
-I've been thinking.
-I doubt that.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.541
I have. You're pretty cool too.

15:54.416 --> 15:56.375
I'm not here to talk to you.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.541
That's harsh.

16:02.416 --> 16:04.000
-I'll come over later.
-Nope!

16:04.083 --> 16:05.041
Yes!

16:05.541 --> 16:07.625
And it's cool, because I'm not mad.

16:08.708 --> 16:11.125
We are you and we are me.

16:11.958 --> 16:13.041
-You know?
-You okay?

16:15.833 --> 16:18.375
-We're talking, Frederik.
-Jonas is!

16:19.000 --> 16:20.750
-See you later.
-No, you won't.

16:20.833 --> 16:22.625
-Yes, I will.
-Get lost.

16:22.708 --> 16:23.708
See you, Pussy Frede.

16:34.625 --> 16:35.625
Hi.

16:38.041 --> 16:39.916
-What's up?
-What are you doing here?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.208
What do you mean?

16:42.791 --> 16:43.916
I love motocross.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.541
I texted both of you because…

16:48.750 --> 16:50.041
Frederik, is your car here?

16:50.958 --> 16:52.250
Yes, it's over there.

16:54.375 --> 16:55.625
Let's go.

16:55.708 --> 16:57.500
-Where?
-To the sawmill.

16:58.375 --> 17:01.708
-But Mads said he and Elvis--
-Yeah, well, I don't agree.

17:01.791 --> 17:03.208
Frederik and I are going.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.625
-Okay?
-Sure.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.166
Are you coming?

17:07.250 --> 17:08.291
Sure.

17:53.208 --> 17:55.625
NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE

17:55.708 --> 17:57.083
Could you move that, Marie?

17:57.625 --> 17:58.625
Sure.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.125
Is this the place?

18:22.708 --> 18:23.708
Yes.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.416
Should we call Mads?

18:34.416 --> 18:38.958
Sure. Great idea. Let's call him and say,
"Hi, Mads. We left without you."

18:39.041 --> 18:39.875
Great idea.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.166
-Let's go and have a look.
-Wait.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.041
What is it?

18:59.666 --> 19:01.250
I don't know. It's just…

19:02.791 --> 19:04.250
It's completely abandoned.

19:05.708 --> 19:06.708
-Come on.
-No.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.708
I'm going.

19:20.791 --> 19:21.666
What?

19:22.166 --> 19:23.958
-You stay here.
-Frederik!

19:26.791 --> 19:28.708
He does that shit all the time.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.458
I feel a bit sorry for him.

19:58.833 --> 19:59.833
How so?

20:01.541 --> 20:03.333
You have to tell him.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Tell him what?

20:06.500 --> 20:07.875
That you're not interested.

20:10.291 --> 20:11.541
He's crazy about you.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.166
He doesn't know…

20:17.791 --> 20:19.000
that the two of us…

20:34.458 --> 20:35.458
Marie…

20:42.166 --> 20:43.375
-It wasn't…
-No.

20:48.791 --> 20:49.916
What are you doing?

20:51.125 --> 20:52.125
Stay here.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.583
I'll go and find him.

22:50.958 --> 22:51.958
Hi.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.000
Hiya.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.291
What are you doing here?

22:57.083 --> 22:57.916
Why?

22:58.458 --> 23:00.125
This is private property.

23:02.666 --> 23:03.666
It's a road.

23:08.583 --> 23:09.708
Are you alone?

23:10.875 --> 23:11.875
Yes.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.208
It looks that way.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.166
Could you step out of the car, please?

23:21.416 --> 23:22.416
No, thank you.

23:24.750 --> 23:27.958
I think your friend would appreciate it
if you came with me.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.125
Come on.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.083
Who are you?

25:28.291 --> 25:29.291
Sit down.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.083
Are there any others here?

25:53.166 --> 25:54.166
-No.
-No.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.291
How did you find the place?

26:02.625 --> 26:03.916
We just went for a drive.

26:05.791 --> 26:08.000
We're the furthest place
away from the town.

26:08.541 --> 26:09.541
It's fenced off.

26:11.125 --> 26:14.208
Seven signs along the main road
state it's private property.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.041
And it's a dead end.

26:17.791 --> 26:18.666
We didn't see them.

26:19.750 --> 26:20.958
Didn't you see them?

26:21.875 --> 26:24.458
-No.
-We were looking for a place to screw.

26:25.916 --> 26:26.916
That's all.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.125
We can screw at home. No problem.

26:30.208 --> 26:31.583
-That's what we'll do.
-Yes.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.500
Hello?

27:51.666 --> 27:53.875
<i>We've got company.</i>
<i>We need to check the area.</i>

29:01.333 --> 29:03.541
We're starting a biodynamic farm.

29:04.041 --> 29:08.125
We're keeping it private and isolated
so fools like you don't ruin it.

29:08.666 --> 29:10.583
-Of course. It was a silly thing to do.
-Yes.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.958
I'm working with new types of companies.

29:23.125 --> 29:24.333
Very sensitive.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.125
-Do we understand each other?
-Completely.

29:30.208 --> 29:32.041
Boring place. No reason to be here.

29:35.958 --> 29:36.833
Great.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.416
Now piss off.

29:45.958 --> 29:46.791
Sure.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.500
<i>Don't let them go.</i>

29:55.083 --> 29:56.083
Your phones.

29:56.583 --> 29:57.833
-Hand them over!
-What?

29:57.916 --> 29:58.833
Hand them over!

30:13.083 --> 30:14.083
Stay here.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.333
-Where is she?
-She went to find you.

30:38.000 --> 30:38.875
Call Mads.

30:38.958 --> 30:39.958
Yes.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.541
I told you to stay in the car.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.291
This place is fucking spooky.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.875
<i>-Mads speaking.</i>
<i>-</i>We fucked up.

30:47.958 --> 30:50.250
We went out there,
and now we can't find Emma.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.208
<i>What do you want me to do about it?</i>

30:52.291 --> 30:54.041
Can you track her phone?

30:54.125 --> 30:55.750
<i>Not necessary. She's on her way.</i>

30:55.833 --> 30:57.666
<i>-</i>On her way to you?
<i>-Yes.</i>

30:57.750 --> 30:59.208
<i>She called. Hurry up.</i>

31:01.083 --> 31:02.416
She left without us.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.625
No.

31:47.291 --> 31:49.333
-What do you mean she's not here?
-You said she was.

31:49.416 --> 31:53.083
-We left without her because of you.
-I said she was on her way. She'll come.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.208
Elvis and I were supposed to go out there.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.666
If I didn't get you out,
you'd have fucked up.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.125
But we left without her.

32:01.708 --> 32:02.750
She'll turn up.

32:08.541 --> 32:10.375
We have to go back and get her.

32:12.791 --> 32:16.375
You do know
she's slept with both of you, right?

32:21.041 --> 32:22.041
What?

32:22.875 --> 32:24.458
She slept with you, Frederik.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.625
And she slept with you, Marie.

32:27.416 --> 32:30.208
First one, then the other.
Both of you, all right?

32:38.541 --> 32:39.875
She took advantage of you.

32:57.416 --> 32:58.416
Marie.

32:59.625 --> 33:01.375
This is bigger than any of us.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.958
We're in this together.

33:04.958 --> 33:08.250
We don't have room for people
who only think of themselves.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.416
Emma isn't special.

33:11.541 --> 33:13.041
-She's just--
-Just what?

33:15.833 --> 33:16.833
An envelope?

33:18.083 --> 33:20.291
A vessel for Hans to hide the ball in?

33:22.791 --> 33:24.583
Someone you just leave behind?

33:26.708 --> 33:29.583
Because she doesn't care about others.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.875
She's not part of the group.

33:33.625 --> 33:34.625
Touching.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.500
Really touching.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.083
Thanks, guys.

33:41.583 --> 33:45.333
I started that car alarm
so you could get out of the house.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.291
But I guess that counts for nothing.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.458
I had the ball planted in my neck.

33:57.250 --> 33:58.416
Not you, Mads.

33:59.375 --> 34:02.583
I was there when Hans died.
This is happening to me.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.833
And I'm not going to sit around
while you call the shots.

34:05.916 --> 34:08.125
You're fucking everything up for us.

34:08.625 --> 34:11.125
-And Astraeus are ready to--
-Astraeus.

34:11.625 --> 34:12.625
Okay.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.541
Tell us what you saw out there.

34:16.791 --> 34:18.000
You saw something, right?

34:18.958 --> 34:20.958
Tell us! We want to hear it. Okay?

34:26.333 --> 34:27.416
There was nothing.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.375
Fuck you!

35:23.083 --> 35:24.083
Hello?

35:30.583 --> 35:31.583
Are you here?

35:37.416 --> 35:38.500
Hello?

35:53.750 --> 35:54.750
Hello?

39:35.000 --> 39:35.875
Emma!

39:39.250 --> 39:40.583
Go!

39:58.166 --> 40:00.125
-You have to help me.
-What did you find?

40:00.208 --> 40:02.083
-They're after me. Please--
-What did you find?

40:05.541 --> 40:06.416
Show me.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.250
Who are you?

40:30.958 --> 40:32.666
That's what I'm trying to find out.
