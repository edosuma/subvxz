WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.275
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.337 --> 00:04.873
Lick the floor!
I said now!

00:12.112 --> 00:14.752
What do you say, friend? Isn't it
time to sell? It is time to sell.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.553
But not to you.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.890
You have second thoughts, you'll
have no trouble finding me.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.488
If I were to come
into a good sum...

00:21.188 --> 00:23.134
Would you come away with me? No.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.497
I don't want to hear this.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.667
How much money
you comin' into, Boyd?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.405
Looks like a ledger, some deeds.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.732
Where's all the money?

00:32.833 --> 00:33.971
We got the wrong box.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.680
No, we got the right box.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.215
I just want back in, Boyd.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.477
I just want you to
trust me again.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.977
You think he was a rat
for the federals?

00:44.244 --> 00:45.723
I think I couldn't
trust him anymore.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.983
We're talking about the bank job
Boyd pulled off this afternoon.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.689
First I heard of it.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.924
That's gonna be your line?
It's the truth.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.160
The problem is, if you didn't know
about it, then you're of no use to us,

00:56.223 --> 00:58.225
in which case,
you're going back to prison.

01:31.692 --> 01:32.864
Whoa! Whoa.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.536
Ava...

01:35.796 --> 01:36.866
Easy. girl.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.706
It's just me. Jesus Christ,
what are you doing?

01:39.900 --> 01:42.642
Uh, well, I couldn't sleep

01:42.736 --> 01:45.273
and thought I'd come and
finish up those railings,

01:45.372 --> 01:46.908
but I couldn't find any paint.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.944
Dewey was supposed
to drop some off.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.710
You ain't seen him around,
have you?

01:51.878 --> 01:53.619
Dewey? No.

01:53.714 --> 01:57.059
And what I mean is, what
are you doing here, Boyd?

01:57.117 --> 02:00.064
I mean, you can't just
show up unannounced.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.498
Well, do you want me to leave?

02:02.589 --> 02:03.897
That's what I'm saying, yeah.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.909
Where exactly
is it that you meant?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.006
Excuse me?

02:17.104 --> 02:20.745
You said you wanted to leave
this place, take me with you.

02:20.807 --> 02:24.482
I was wondering where exactly
it was you had in mind.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.423
Honestly...

02:27.247 --> 02:29.955
I'll go wherever
you want to go, Ava...

02:30.651 --> 02:32.790
As long as it means
I get to be with you.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.924
What if I said Iceland?

02:38.025 --> 02:41.336
Uh, well, I don't own a coat
that big, but...

02:41.428 --> 02:44.534
If that's where you want to call
home, I could probably pick one up.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.339
That's a good answer, Boyd.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.108
Well, I'm happy it pleases you.

02:51.538 --> 02:52.812
I guess I'll be on my way.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.397
I don't know, man. She
doesn't look like a Nazi.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.100
I ain't saying
she's a Nazi.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.269
I'm just saying she grew up
near Sukey Ridge.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.277
Boyd's skinheads
used to train up there.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.245
What he called his
Christian aggression church.

03:57.337 --> 04:00.045
Well, if she is a Nazi, would
you still sleep with her?

04:00.107 --> 04:01.381
Should she be walking by now?

04:01.441 --> 04:02.852
Oh, good,
so that is your kid.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.082
I was worried that was
some random Internet baby.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.851
Yeah, I got tired
of the cat videos.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.427
Bureau's finishing up.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.760
Sure you don't want to
change your position?

04:11.852 --> 04:15.425
Listen to me, there are two kinds
of folks living up in them hollers.

04:15.522 --> 04:18.526
Mmm-hmm. One,
sympathizes with Boyd.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.539
They grew up on welfare, but they
still don't trust the government.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.364
They won't talk
to census takers,

04:23.430 --> 04:25.510
and they think we're gonna
come take their guns away.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.871
- And the other?
- This is the part

04:26.933 --> 04:28.133
where you say,
"I told you so."

04:28.568 --> 04:31.572
Says all she saw
were guns and feet.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.151
How'd she seem? RACHEL: Scared
to death of Boyd Crowder.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.379
That's the other kind.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.315
You want to know
what I was thinking?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.617
You two
head down to Harlan,

04:39.713 --> 04:41.454
interview the box owners
who were robbed.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.255
Find out what was taken
and catch Boyd

04:43.316 --> 04:46.058
in possession of stolen goods.
Okey-dokey.

04:46.419 --> 04:47.989
What?

04:48.054 --> 04:51.263
No. I just figured you might
want to go at Boyd directly.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.770
I want to keep building a RICO
case like we've been doing.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.273
Besides, we don't have to go
at him directly. We got Ava.

04:56.329 --> 04:59.276
'Cause she was so helpful
getting us ahead of the bank robbery.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.005
She's on our side.
Give her time.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.171
Yeah.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.748
Is that what I'm supposed to
tell the Attorney General?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.147
Tell him what you want.
If you'd like,

05:05.238 --> 05:08.310
you could tell him that we're working
the case. We'll have something soon.

05:08.408 --> 05:09.910
That the truth?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.422
If you stop asking me questions
and let us get on the road.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.480
All right.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.820
Keep me posted.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.499
Glorious morning, isn't it?

05:27.794 --> 05:28.966
That what you're selling?

05:29.462 --> 05:31.806
If you mean positivity
and charm, then perhaps I am.

05:32.766 --> 05:36.771
Don't know what's more slick.
Your mouth or your ride.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.340
You believe in all my days,
I've never driven a Mercedes?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.820
Well, uh, take her for a spin?

05:42.876 --> 05:45.482
Handsome young man
comes to my house,

05:45.545 --> 05:49.550
spewing sunshine, offering
a ride in his Mercedes.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.562
Feels like maybe I'm chatting
with the devil himself.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.888
What's this about?

05:53.987 --> 05:57.867
I come to offer you an opportunity
to depart this burdensome homestead,

05:57.958 --> 06:00.404
live the rest of your days
free as newborn babes.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.972
Oh, I was right.
You are the devil.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.031
No, ma'am,
just a man with a plan.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.906
You know, another fella
already came by.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.673
Uh, uh, Calhoun something.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.237
Schreier.
He works for me.

06:10.337 --> 06:14.080
Ah, then you know I already told
him this property ain't for sale.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.882
That is affirmative. You are
entrenched, he told me.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.253
I said I will increase
my offer 20%.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.656
Turning us down then
would be an act of insanity.

06:23.817 --> 06:28.562
My husband's grandparents discovered
this plot, built the house themselves.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.062
We have farmed this land
best we could.

06:32.158 --> 06:35.196
I taught English at Evarts
High School for 26 years

06:35.262 --> 06:37.572
to keep us afloat during
the lean harvests.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.103
It's a legacy, you see?

06:40.600 --> 06:42.705
And one we don't
intend to discard.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.509
Well, nothing lasts forever.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.609
Except this conversation,
it seems.

06:47.707 --> 06:50.415
Oh, you do not want to
send me away empty-handed.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.217
What I hear,
we wouldn't be the first.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.185
After Calhoun came by,
I asked around.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.525
I know you've been chasing the Givens
property. I know he turned you down.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.690
We'll have the Givens'
property soon enough...

07:01.888 --> 07:03.561
And yours, too.

07:03.623 --> 07:06.229
How that comes to pass
depends entirely on you.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.601
Now, I'm gonna tell you something,
and I want you to listen.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.108
There ain't no version
of this story

07:12.198 --> 07:16.203
that ends with us selling
this house to some peacock.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.449
What did you call me?

07:19.539 --> 07:20.916
You heard me.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.214
Peacock?

07:23.310 --> 07:26.621
I come here in peace,

07:28.281 --> 07:31.455
try to change your lives,
and you call me a peacock?

07:31.818 --> 07:33.229
A goddamn peacock.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.598
Peacock?

08:14.461 --> 08:17.999
You were supposed to find
out where Calhoun's keeping his cash

08:18.098 --> 08:20.305
and steal it, not raid
his filing cabinet.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.846
Assuming he has cash at all

08:21.935 --> 08:24.108
and you two ain't been
wasting my goddamn time.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.342
He has it.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.384
Is that what I'm supposed
to tell the three

08:27.474 --> 08:29.454
pissed-off rednecks
who work for me?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.852
The money is there.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.116
You just have to try
a little harder, Boyd.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.852
You check his office
for a secret safe?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.107
- Of course.
- And his home?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.150
And his mama's home

08:37.217 --> 08:39.025
and the trunk of his
blue Cadillac.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.888
If he has $3 million in cash,

08:40.986 --> 08:42.746
he hasn't gone near it
in the last two weeks.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.930
I could use a cut
while you're at it.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.136
You know,
there is another possibility

08:47.193 --> 08:48.331
we should discuss.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.465
Which would be?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.591
You asking me if I have millions
of dollars hidden under my sofa?

08:53.633 --> 08:55.237
Put yourself in my shoes, Boyd.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.495
Well, I don't know, Katherine.

08:56.503 --> 08:57.743
They look mighty uncomfortable.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.044
It's a fair question, Boyd.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.243
You accusing me?

09:03.977 --> 09:05.217
Answer the question, Boyd.

09:05.678 --> 09:06.918
If I had taken that money,

09:07.013 --> 09:08.924
I'd be halfway to Mexico by now,

09:09.015 --> 09:11.325
wearing a smile
and my Ray-Bans,

09:11.384 --> 09:13.694
not sitting here
taking questions

09:13.753 --> 09:15.494
from a woman I hardly know
and a man

09:15.555 --> 09:17.795
who should know better than
to ask me in the first place.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.671
Now, you gonna get me that cup of
coffee, or should I get it myself?

09:20.827 --> 09:22.101
You can get it yourself.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.238
Ah, well, so much for
Southern hospitality.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.007
This ledger
might be something.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.343
Offshore bank accounts,
transaction amounts, dates.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.847
This might be his life raft.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.784
You better hope it's worth
my cut of $3 million.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.350
I think it's worth a shot.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.017
I'll be in touch.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.719
How's Ava doing, Boyd?

09:41.781 --> 09:42.919
It must have been quite a shock,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.656
her getting out of prison
the way she did.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.558
You want to chat about movies

09:46.619 --> 09:49.065
or politics or how
I take my coffee,

09:49.122 --> 09:50.726
I'm happy to oblige,

09:51.191 --> 09:53.467
but ain't no way in hell I'm gonna
talk to you about my fiancee.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.130
I just simply asked
how she was doing.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.536
Man's had a rough night.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.704
What do you say we let him be?

10:05.772 --> 10:07.547
We can't gang up on him,
Katherine.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.547
You're as concerned about
her release as I am.

10:12.479 --> 10:13.924
I know how to handle
the hillbilly.

10:14.647 --> 10:15.955
Have a little faith.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.790
God damn.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.631
I knew it was only
a matter of time

10:25.725 --> 10:27.045
before you walked
through my door.

10:27.093 --> 10:28.163
Calhoun.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.299
Tired of waiting for that old
place to sell itself, huh?

10:31.397 --> 10:34.276
Well, you have come
to the right man.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.507
Calhoun Schreier.
Pleased to meet you.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.444
I guess Raylan told you I'm the best damn
realtor this side of the Mason-Dixon.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.679
No, he didn't mention that.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.151
God's honest truth.

10:43.243 --> 10:47.089
Nobody moves more property
in Harlan County, nobody.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.656
And you know why that is?

10:48.748 --> 10:51.752
I know what makes
people feel safe,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.492
the place that helps
them go to sleep at night.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.658
Fact is, I put my money
where my mouth is.

10:56.756 --> 10:57.826
Not why we're here.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.870
I don't sell Arlo's
place in 30 days,

10:59.959 --> 11:01.131
you pay me no commission.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.602
- No shit?
- Fact is,

11:03.663 --> 11:05.506
I already have
an interested party.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.941
All right, look, as big a boner

11:07.000 --> 11:08.707
as all this real-estate
talk is giving me,

11:08.801 --> 11:09.836
that's not actually why we're...

11:12.605 --> 11:14.107
That's him.
That's who?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.278
The interested party.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.286
You just let me do
all the talking,

11:17.343 --> 11:19.183
and we'll close the deal
right here, right now.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.351
Raylan Givens, home seller,

11:22.448 --> 11:23.984
meet Ty Walker, home buyer.

11:24.050 --> 11:26.553
Ah, came to your senses,
did you?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.155
Decided to take my offer.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.795
No, I didn't.

11:30.156 --> 11:33.000
We're here to talk to you about
your safe-deposit box, Calhoun.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.563
Safe-deposit box?

11:34.661 --> 11:36.334
Judging by the blank
look on your face,

11:36.396 --> 11:38.342
I'm gonna go ahead and say
you are not aware

11:38.398 --> 11:41.641
that your safe-deposit box at
First River Bank was robbed.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.410
No.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.216
I also didn't know that Marshals
handled bank robberies.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.151
Oh, sure, we're interested
in all sorts of fun crime stuff.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.383
We're just taking inventory
of the stolen items

11:52.478 --> 11:54.856
in case they turn up in the
course of our investigation.

11:55.815 --> 11:56.919
Well,
I wish I could help,

11:57.016 --> 11:58.427
but my box is empty.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.398
Well, did you take something
out the day before?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.667
Records indicate you accessed the
box the day before the robbery.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.561
At which time I took
everything out.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.765
Mostly just paperwork,
client documents, and such.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.000
Nothing exciting.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.772
Well, I am relieved to hear that
nothing of value was stolen.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.903
Any notion of a suspect?

12:16.002 --> 12:18.448
You have any notion
of how an investigation works?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.449
Only
what I done seen on the TV.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.860
Does it rock
your world I told you

12:21.874 --> 12:23.512
we don't discuss open cases

12:23.576 --> 12:25.336
with every joe dipshit
we meet on the street?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.580
Ah. You're kind of a dick,
huh, guy?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.120
Calhoun, you think of anything

12:29.215 --> 12:31.354
might have slipped your mind,
give us a call, huh?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.417
Let me know about
representing your place.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.693
Mmm-hmm.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.939
You being square with those
boys that your box was empty?

12:44.030 --> 12:45.407
Of course I was.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.638
Yeah, you still outside?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.371
Those two guys that just left.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.755
I'm gonna need you
to follow them.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.614
That smart?

12:52.705 --> 12:53.740
Following the Marshals?

12:54.374 --> 12:55.814
Hasn't occurred
to you for one second

12:55.875 --> 12:57.377
that you might have been
the target of that robbery?

12:57.543 --> 12:58.823
Well, why would I be the target?

12:59.078 --> 13:01.922
Well, I'm sure I don't know, but
the boss will want us to find out.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.295
So, we follow the Marshals,
who lead us to a suspect,

13:05.385 --> 13:07.422
at which point we grab the guy,

13:07.487 --> 13:09.592
pull his teeth out till he
tells us what we want to know,

13:09.656 --> 13:11.727
and then, probably kill him.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.136
I'm just kidding,
Calhoun.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.099
We'll definitely kill him.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.683
9 to 12 months, by the way.
Hmm?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.311
That's when Google says babies
are supposed to start walking.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.854
How old's Willa?
Nine months.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.514
You
worried she might be, uh,

13:33.613 --> 13:34.683
behind the curve?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.326
I just don't want to miss it.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.488
Who's that?
Ava. She wants to meet.

13:39.585 --> 13:40.586
Okay.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.259
We still got to interview the rest
of the safe-deposit-box owners.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.700
Well, it appears
we're a car short.

13:44.791 --> 13:46.031
That ain't our only problem.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.468
You referring to the guy
following us?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.529
Mmm-hmm. Is this
anyone you recognize?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.700
No, but he's been with us
since we left Calhoun's.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.718
All right,
what do you want to do?

13:53.766 --> 13:56.337
You want to flapjack him,
you want to short-bus him,

13:56.436 --> 13:58.279
you want to
special-attention him?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.442
Any of those even things?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.007
I'm mostly just making shit up.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.780
Speed up.
Take this next right.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.263
I told you, they ain't
doing nothing but driving.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.022
Oh, shit.
Hold on, hold on.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.157
Hold on a second.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.857
Where they going?

14:16.889 --> 14:18.129
Oh!

14:18.458 --> 14:19.630
Shit!

14:25.832 --> 14:27.641
Get out of the road,
cock holster!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.304
Well, that ain't polite.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.905
Just about hit me,
and now you're gonna sling

14:31.003 --> 14:32.539
foul utterances in my direction?

14:32.638 --> 14:33.918
You're in the middle
of the road.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.985
I'm driving.
I can see that.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.083
Where to?

14:39.979 --> 14:41.652
I'll call you back.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.694
It's none of your business, Officer.
US Marshal.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.758
Still none of your business.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.228
Let me get this straight, son.

14:49.322 --> 14:52.735
Where you're following me
to is none of my business?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.168
That's how you see it?

14:55.328 --> 14:56.568
I'm not following you.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.505
Step out of the car.
Stretch your legs a bit.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.780
God damn.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.451
You comfortable in this car,
a man your size?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.612
It's a little tight.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.922
Yeah.
So, where's your buddy?

15:13.012 --> 15:14.047
Who's that?

15:14.614 --> 15:15.894
You know, the guy you were with.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.056
How do you know I was with a guy
if you ain't been following me?

15:22.221 --> 15:23.359
I'm not following you.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.430
Are you saying
you ain't following me

15:25.525 --> 15:26.799
like you don't know
what I'm saying,

15:26.893 --> 15:29.032
or are you just repeating
this bullshit about,

15:29.095 --> 15:30.438
you ain't been following me?

15:32.231 --> 15:33.301
I'm not following you.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.878
Son, are you real smart
or real stupid?

15:37.136 --> 15:38.206
Choo-Choo.

15:38.704 --> 15:39.944
Ex-excuse me, what?

15:40.306 --> 15:41.376
Choo-Choo.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.887
You're saying your name
is Choo-Choo?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.888
Since I was a kid,
folks called me Choo-Choo.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.653
Because you like trains?

15:50.550 --> 15:53.827
'Cause when I hit you, it
comes hard, it comes fast...

15:53.920 --> 15:54.921
Like a choo-choo train.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.458
You want to try me?

16:01.260 --> 16:02.500
Not today, Choo-Choo.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.442
Today, I'm just gonna
take your car.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.322
Where are you?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.694
You know, forget all that shit.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.767
There's someone
I want you to meet.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.975
We should have been doing
this the last 14 years.

16:46.772 --> 16:49.275
I wasn't the one
who left Kentucky.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.889
It was only a matter of time. Whoever
flipped on Grady flipped on me.

16:53.980 --> 16:54.981
I knew that.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.950
I didn't blame you for going.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.831
I seem to recall asking you
to come with me.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.725
My husband had
just been arrested.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.796
Made me like you even more,

17:06.858 --> 17:08.667
the way you stuck by him.

17:11.830 --> 17:15.540
Yeah, it looks like you did
just fine without me.

17:15.635 --> 17:21.517
Come home the big conquering hero
in your Rolls and your $500 boots.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.521
Yeah, well,

17:25.678 --> 17:27.919
I suppose life's been
pretty good to me.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.156
Cheers.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.657
Cheers.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.166
And there's this,
which is lovely, by the way.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.736
Clean body high.
Mellow.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.568
No paranoia.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.438
Nothing but the best, that it?

17:46.098 --> 17:47.839
Be that way from here on,
if you want.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.272
Oh, you gonna
take care of me, Avery?

17:51.370 --> 17:53.509
You never needed
taking care of, Katherine.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.946
You know I'm a grandmother now.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.422
I do.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.254
That make you happy?

18:04.717 --> 18:06.094
Not really.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.924
Laurel's got the
nanny raising them.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.524
Some girl from the Philippines.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.070
She speaks llonggo to them.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.165
I don't even know what
they're saying half the time.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.970
Something else bothering you?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.978
I get high, I get very tuned in.

18:26.872 --> 18:27.942
Yeah.

18:28.975 --> 18:32.115
Okay, I'm worried an employee
of mine's stealing from me.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.948
An employee?
Mmm-hmm.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.582
You open up a donut shop?

18:37.049 --> 18:38.619
The gardener.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.561
So fire him.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.624
He's in the middle of a big
landscaping project, you know?

18:43.723 --> 18:46.101
It would be a real chore

18:46.158 --> 18:47.398
getting rid of him right now.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.164
Know what I do,
keep my people loyal?

18:51.430 --> 18:52.670
Do tell.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.903
Overpay them.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.811
Christmas bonus, Easter bonus,

18:56.902 --> 19:00.406
President's Day bonus, Pappy
Van Winkle on their birthday.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.815
Don't nobody bite this hand.

19:03.909 --> 19:06.515
Yeah, well, it must be a little
harder to turn a profit,

19:06.612 --> 19:07.750
I would imagine.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.254
There's plenty to go around,

19:10.416 --> 19:12.919
and it's a small price
lo pay for loyalty.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.314
All right, but what if
one of them did betray you?

19:17.356 --> 19:19.358
What would you do then?

19:20.092 --> 19:21.935
Cut off a finger
the way Grady used to?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.003
If cutting fingers were enough,

19:24.096 --> 19:26.633
Grady would still be alive,
wouldn't he?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.151
Well, what, then.
Take out an eye?

19:38.444 --> 19:39.650
An eye?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.659
I don't know.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.789
One-eyed guy can still see,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.624
still get a driver's license,
even.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.126
Both eyes maybe.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.035
That'd be a good start.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.472
You
let him take your vehicle?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.374
No, just...
What's your position?

20:04.970 --> 20:06.472
Just hold there.
I'll be by soon.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.175
Everything okay?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.150
Aah!

20:14.814 --> 20:16.020
Aah!

20:22.822 --> 20:24.062
What's the bank manager's name?

20:24.890 --> 20:25.891
What?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.166
Bank manager.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.867
The manager of your bank, the one
that got robbed. What's his name?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.824
See, the police would have
spoken to your bank manager,

20:33.833 --> 20:35.744
which means
he might know something about

20:35.835 --> 20:38.281
who's suspected of stealing
your safe-deposit box, so...

20:38.370 --> 20:39.940
So who's the bank manager?

20:40.039 --> 20:41.541
Um, it's a woman.

20:41.607 --> 20:42.677
Okay?

20:45.177 --> 20:46.588
Do you mind if I get this?

20:46.912 --> 20:48.414
Oh, for f...

20:48.514 --> 20:50.721
I won't if you don't want me to.

20:50.783 --> 20:51.853
Just hurry up.

20:55.855 --> 20:56.925
This is Calhoun.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.464
You got my text, I presume?

20:59.692 --> 21:00.932
On, hey.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.369
Good to hear from you.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.874
<i>Seeing as haw you really don't want
to know the answer to that question,</i>

21:04.930 --> 21:06.375
<i>I take it now's not a good time.</i>

21:06.565 --> 21:08.067
Not this moment.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.854
<i>Well, then let me
make this quick.</i>

21:10.102 --> 21:13.640
I was enjoying my morning
constitutional, and lo and behold,

21:13.739 --> 21:16.743
what do I find lying
on the side of the road

21:16.809 --> 21:21.053
but a stack of real-estate deeds and a
ledger that I believe belong to you.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.087
<i>Now, it seems to me</i>

21:23.149 --> 21:27.291
that the reward for the return of such
materials should be rather substantial.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.991
<i>Or else my next phone call's gonna
be to your business associates,</i>

21:31.090 --> 21:32.610
<i>see what they got to say.</i>
Just hang up.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.912
Hang up, hang up. Well, I'd love
to talk to you further on this,

21:36.061 --> 21:38.473
but, uh, perhaps in a few hours?

21:38.564 --> 21:40.237
<i>Your office, 8:00?</i>

21:41.233 --> 21:43.440
That should be fine.
<i>And, Calhoun,</i>

21:44.136 --> 21:46.138
when I say substantial,

21:46.238 --> 21:48.309
I mean a whole lot of money,

21:48.908 --> 21:51.628
or you and me gonna have a problem
that ain't easily solved. You dig?

21:52.244 --> 21:54.190
Great. I'll see you then.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.782
Important client. Sorry.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.192
The bank manager, Calhoun.
Uh...

22:01.420 --> 22:03.627
Oh...

22:08.427 --> 22:10.703
Uh, Judy. June. Gladys.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.610
Uh, Joyce Kipling.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.771
Joyce Kipling.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.159
Hey, boss.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.466
Where you headed?

22:42.127 --> 22:44.630
So, I searched it
and found these.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.371
Thought they might be
from that bank robbery.

22:47.466 --> 22:49.146
You know, it was kind of fun,
to be honest.

22:49.635 --> 22:52.047
Felt like I was in a movie.

22:52.137 --> 22:53.741
That what it's like
every clay for you?

22:54.506 --> 22:55.985
How'd you know
to look in the shed?

22:57.409 --> 22:59.320
Told you, I heard Boyd
banging around in there.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.482
What was he doing?

23:01.180 --> 23:02.557
He was banging around in there.

23:03.816 --> 23:04.886
Why was he in the shed?

23:05.851 --> 23:07.524
Said that he was looking
for paint,

23:07.586 --> 23:10.260
that Dewey was supposed to have
dropped some off, but hadn't.

23:10.356 --> 23:11.528
Dewey. Huh.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.263
You know, I thought this
was gonna go more like,

23:15.361 --> 23:19.070
"Wow, Ava, thank you so much.
This is wonderful."

23:19.164 --> 23:20.438
Were they hidden well?

23:22.701 --> 23:24.442
These docs,
were they difficult to find?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.414
I don't know, not that hard.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.008
What are you getting at?

23:32.011 --> 23:33.456
You think he set me up?

23:34.079 --> 23:35.285
I never said that, Ava.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.586
Oh, my God, you do
think he set me up.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.533
How close are you
two these days?

23:45.557 --> 23:47.093
Like how?

23:47.192 --> 23:48.796
Am I sleeping with him?

23:48.894 --> 23:50.771
You think he's got any
reason to suspect you?

23:50.863 --> 23:54.606
Well, shit, Raylan, I wouldn't
have thought so 30 seconds ago.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.203
You saying that
I'm in danger?

23:58.037 --> 23:59.107
I don't know.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.941
If he set them up for me
to take and I took them,

24:02.041 --> 24:04.612
than what the hell are we
gonna do now?

24:05.911 --> 24:07.652
Just put them back.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.322
Man...

24:15.988 --> 24:17.126
"Get me something, Ava.

24:17.222 --> 24:19.998
"Risk your life and then
put them back."

24:21.427 --> 24:23.566
I swear this man's
gonna drive me insane.

24:31.236 --> 24:32.408
Where the hell you been?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.451
Marshal took my car, left
me on the side of the road.

24:34.506 --> 24:35.610
That's where the hell I've been.

24:35.674 --> 24:36.744
He took your car?

24:36.809 --> 24:37.929
He can't just take your car.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.149
What the hell did you do?

24:39.244 --> 24:40.780
Hitched a ride. What else
was I supposed to do?

24:40.846 --> 24:43.656
I mean, what did you do that
made the Marshal take your car?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.191
You make a friend?

24:47.286 --> 24:48.526
Yeah.
Told you I hitched a ride.

24:48.587 --> 24:50.123
That's the guy
that picked me up.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.601
Get this, he was in the
sandbox same time as we were.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.796
Tim. Gutterson.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.031
Rangers.
Sean.

24:56.128 --> 24:57.266
Good to see you, brother.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.973
We call him Seabass
on account of this

25:00.032 --> 25:02.512
State Department chick he nailed
in the Green Zone in '06.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.445
All right.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.343
They just let you boys take
what you want, huh?

25:07.773 --> 25:09.013
Yeah, our boss owns this place.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.985
I mean, I ain't gonna say no.

25:11.043 --> 25:14.286
Can we just back up for one second
to the Marshal taking your car?

25:14.613 --> 25:16.024
Mmm.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.958
I should have choked
his cowboy ass out,

25:18.017 --> 25:20.017
left him for dead on the
side of the road, but, uh,

25:20.019 --> 25:23.125
I figured someone drives by and
sees, I'd have to kill them.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.397
You know, and somebody else drives by
and sees, and I'd have to kill them.

25:26.492 --> 25:29.996
You know, and another car drives by
and sees and I have to kill them.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.874
You know, and...
I mean, 'cause...

25:32.965 --> 25:34.137
He's cool.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.759
I already told him
all this shit anyway.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.179
Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a great
talk on the drive over.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.875
He says you guys are with
Tigerhawk Security?

25:39.972 --> 25:41.042
He did, huh?

25:41.140 --> 25:43.313
Yeah, he said Tigerhawk
used to have you overseas.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.720
He misses the action over
there, but he likes Harlan.

25:46.812 --> 25:47.916
He likes the hills.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.390
I do.
I like the hills.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.688
- You like the hills, Seabass?
- No, not really.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.661
Kind of just pussy versions
of mountains, you know.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.892
Yeah, you know,
I was curious what exactly

25:55.988 --> 25:58.901
you boys are working on gets
a Marshal to steal your car.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.561
Listen, Tim.
It's Tim, right?

26:00.659 --> 26:03.401
Right. While I appreciate
you helping out my buddy,

26:03.529 --> 26:05.600
I think you better be on your way.
Come on, man.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.904
I ain't even finished my beer.
Don't be an asshole, Seabass.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.843
See, the deal with
Choo-Choo here is,

26:09.902 --> 26:12.348
he got, uh,
some shrapnel in his head...

26:12.571 --> 26:14.448
Yeah. And now I spend
most of my time

26:14.540 --> 26:16.076
trying to keep him from
doing something stupid.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.745
Better watch what you say
in front of other people.

26:17.843 --> 26:20.289
Watch what I say in f... You just told
him you were gonna kill a Marshal!

26:20.379 --> 26:22.552
Keep disrespecting me,
you're gonna ride the train.

26:22.614 --> 26:23.752
I'm all aboard, Choo-Choo.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.055
- Come on!
- All right.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.257
As much as I'd love to sit
and hang with you guys,

26:28.353 --> 26:29.633
I should be getting back
to work,

26:29.688 --> 26:31.599
but when I see the cowboy,

26:31.690 --> 26:32.970
I'll let him know what you said.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.060
Why would you see him?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.799
Just, you know,
around the office and all.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.864
See, I still work for Uncle Sam.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.604
I'm just with the Marshals now.

26:42.534 --> 26:45.071
Choo-Choo, you got picked up by.
Yeah.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.139
Threw me for a loop, too.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.219
I'll let my boy know
he dodged a bullet.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.378
You tell him.

26:50.709 --> 26:52.711
Then could you ask him
to bring back my car?

26:52.778 --> 26:54.155
Absolutely.

26:56.548 --> 26:57.583
Are you okay?

26:57.649 --> 27:00.061
You seem more intense
than usual.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.598
Can I be honest with you?

27:01.653 --> 27:02.723
Of course you can.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.233
I don't feel well.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.127
This may be my last day
on God's great Earth.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.398
Oh, my goodness.

27:08.894 --> 27:10.237
Do you have the cancer?

27:10.295 --> 27:11.603
No.

27:11.663 --> 27:12.971
But I'm in trouble.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.100
Well,

27:14.166 --> 27:16.077
you just go ahead
and you get out that money,

27:16.135 --> 27:18.081
and then you can tell me
all about it.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.000
God damn it, Raylan!
We're closed!

27:30.082 --> 27:31.152
Didn't you see the sign?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.423
Oh, I must have missed it.

27:33.585 --> 27:34.655
Oh!

27:34.753 --> 27:36.699
I don't believe
I've met Mrs. Schreier.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.358
Ew. Gross.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.661
Sorry.
Didn't peg you

27:40.759 --> 27:42.329
as the pay-to-play type,
Calhoun,

27:42.427 --> 27:45.135
especially at 6:00 p.m.
on a weekday.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.336
Deputy US Marshal,
Raylan Givens.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.139
It's okay, ma'am.
You're free to go.

27:49.601 --> 27:50.705
Not you, Calhoun.

27:50.802 --> 27:51.962
You sit your ass right there.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.677
Only the truth
will set you free.

27:53.772 --> 27:54.842
I can't, Raylan.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.010
I know you lied to me.

27:56.308 --> 27:57.810
I know about the deeds
and ledger.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.987
You should just tell him.
He could help you.

28:00.045 --> 28:01.285
Excuse me, what?

28:06.118 --> 28:07.222
Do you want me to do it?

28:09.655 --> 28:10.793
I would love that.

28:11.623 --> 28:14.229
He has been buying property
for a group of guys,

28:14.326 --> 28:16.636
which seemed innocent enough until
he realized they're bad guys.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.073
Chasing easy money. Best way
to end up over your head.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.041
Yeah, no shit, right?

28:21.133 --> 28:23.374
So, he started writing down
everything he could remember,

28:23.468 --> 28:26.039
like account numbers and
amounts, to protect himself.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.550
You talking about a ledger?
Yes, a blackmail ledger,

28:28.640 --> 28:30.415
which now he's being
blackmailed for,

28:30.509 --> 28:32.989
but if the bad guys find out that
it exists, they're gonna kill him.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.524
What does the blackmailer want?

28:35.013 --> 28:36.549
I don't know...

28:41.353 --> 28:44.061
Cash they're using to
buy up all this property.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.829
And where's it at?

28:46.658 --> 28:49.161
I meet Walker,
he gives me the cash.

28:49.761 --> 28:54.608
This blackmailer, he got a longwinded,
peculiar way of speaking?

29:21.093 --> 29:23.573
I thought we agreed you weren't
gonna show up here unannounced.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.438
Well, I think we need
to talk, don't you?

29:26.698 --> 29:28.200
Oh, I believe we do.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.104
After you left this morning,
I went back to the shed.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.615
I put everything back
the way I like it.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.481
I was just about clone when I
found that shit you stashed.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.719
So, you took my shit?

29:44.783 --> 29:45.921
You're damn right I did.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.797
Why?
Are you kidding?

29:48.053 --> 29:49.623
I heard about that
bank got robbed!

29:49.721 --> 29:51.792
You hid what
you stoled on my property,

29:51.890 --> 29:53.301
and you wonder why I took it?

29:53.392 --> 29:54.666
I should have burned it.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.933
No. Oh, I know you
didn't burn it.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.800
I figured if you went to all
the trouble to put it here,

29:59.898 --> 30:03.311
risk me getting caught
and sent back to prison,

30:03.402 --> 30:05.245
oh, it must be
awful important to you.

30:06.838 --> 30:08.078
Where are they now, Ava?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.313
In the truck, on the seat!

30:10.409 --> 30:12.150
You take them, and you get them

30:12.244 --> 30:13.689
the hell off my property!

31:27.386 --> 31:29.263
Fancy seeing you here.

31:31.990 --> 31:35.230
You know, I've never been entirely certain
what that phrase is supposed to denote.

31:35.527 --> 31:38.667
Does it mean, "this gathering here
must be fancy 'cause you're present, “

31:38.997 --> 31:41.671
or is it simply
an expression of surprise

31:41.733 --> 31:45.704
at such a random meeting between
two friends or acquaintances?

31:46.705 --> 31:49.049
Jesus, Boyd,
I was just saying hello.

31:49.107 --> 31:50.916
Oh, is that why you're here,
Raylan?

31:51.009 --> 31:52.079
Say hello to me?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.690
Actually,
I'm here to see Calhoun.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.853
Oh, you finally selling
Arlo's place, huh?

31:58.183 --> 31:59.719
On account of
I've been transferred.

32:00.118 --> 32:01.392
Off to Florida.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.727
Raylan Givens a father.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.927
What is the world coming to?

32:05.524 --> 32:07.731
Try and to raise that baby
girl of yours up right?

32:08.693 --> 32:10.104
Better than we were, anyway.

32:10.195 --> 32:13.642
Well, what say I make you an offer
on Arlo's place right this minute,

32:13.732 --> 32:15.040
help get you on your way?

32:15.534 --> 32:16.877
You got that kind of cash, Boyd?

32:17.068 --> 32:18.877
Oh, I'm fixing to, soon.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.140
How's that?

32:20.238 --> 32:21.649
You gonna rob a bank, too?

32:23.742 --> 32:25.813
Apparently, First River
was hit yesterday.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.518
Calhoun just left me a message,

32:27.579 --> 32:29.388
said some of his things
were taken.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.394
Why he's not gonna
make it over here.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.258
Well, that is news to me.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.632
Sounded pretty shook up
about it.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.633
Being blackmailed over
the return of his things.

32:38.723 --> 32:40.964
I guess he's talking to the
cops right now as we speak.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.469
But here I am being rude.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.099
I haven't even asked you
what you're doing here.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.269
Oh, well, uh,
the funniest thing.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.013
I stopped off down at the depot this
morning to get a cup of coffee,

32:51.503 --> 32:53.303
found some items lying
on the side of the road

32:53.338 --> 32:56.114
I believe belong
to our mutual friend.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.415
I took it upon myself to
ensure their safe return.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.082
Mighty Christian of you.

33:00.245 --> 33:03.522
Well, I don't know about that.
I'm just following my instincts.

33:03.615 --> 33:06.152
Kind of like a higher power
slipping you a word.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.260
I just run with it.

33:09.087 --> 33:10.828
You see, Raylan,

33:10.922 --> 33:13.994
I've learned to think
without arguing with myself.

33:14.926 --> 33:15.961
Hmm.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.873
Well, I slip a Glock in
my holster every morning,

33:19.364 --> 33:21.366
so when you hand me
them items, do it slow

33:21.466 --> 33:22.809
or I'll shoot you.

33:28.273 --> 33:30.048
I think I'll just
come back tomorrow.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.620
Or

33:31.676 --> 33:33.622
You can give them to me
if you want.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.952
Why not?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.621
Save me the trip.

33:43.622 --> 33:44.965
I'd say I'll see you around,

33:45.023 --> 33:47.196
but it sounds like
you won't be for very long.

33:47.559 --> 33:48.902
Probably not.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.032
Does it change you?

33:54.132 --> 33:55.202
What's that?

33:55.300 --> 33:56.802
Having a child.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.241
They say it changes a man.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.244
You think that's true?

34:05.176 --> 34:07.213
Guess we'll see, won't we?

34:17.322 --> 34:18.357
Hmm.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.277
Hi, Joyce.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.101
Sorry, sorry.
Didn't mean to startle you.

34:32.337 --> 34:33.577
My name's Ty Walker.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.192
I've been retained by
one of the people

34:35.239 --> 34:37.516
who got their safe-deposit
box stolen from your bank.

34:39.444 --> 34:41.389
I see. Well, you know,
I'm kind of tired.

34:41.446 --> 34:42.947
Why don't we talk about
this tomorrow at the bank?

34:43.047 --> 34:45.027
My client, he's impatient.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.750
It'd mean an awful lot to me if
we could just talk right now.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.264
Let me help you with those.
Oh, I can get it.

34:50.355 --> 34:51.958
No. I insist.

34:52.357 --> 34:53.802
There.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.030
Fingers.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.473
So, my client was wondering

34:59.030 --> 35:00.941
if the police had said
anything to you at all

35:01.032 --> 35:02.992
about who they think might
have done this robbery.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.103
The police?

35:04.202 --> 35:07.274
Or perhaps you've heard rumors
and innuendo elsewhere?

35:07.372 --> 35:08.544
It's a small town.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.044
I'm sure tongues are wagging.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.787
I'm sorry.

35:13.878 --> 35:14.948
Who are you again?

35:15.213 --> 35:16.419
Ty Walker.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.126
I'm a fully licensed operative.

35:20.218 --> 35:21.754
Tigerhawk Security Services.

35:22.087 --> 35:24.727
Now, you know conversations with the
police are not confidential, right?

35:24.823 --> 35:27.463
There's no law that says
you can't share with me

35:27.559 --> 35:29.163
what they shared with you.

35:38.737 --> 35:39.909
What about eggs?

35:40.972 --> 35:42.007
Eggs?

35:42.474 --> 35:43.612
Maybe you're hungry.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.075
I get like that on
an empty stomach.

35:45.076 --> 35:47.579
I can't formulate a thought
in my head, but...

35:48.747 --> 35:51.353
You've got bacon here,

35:51.449 --> 35:52.985
mushrooms, bell peppers,

35:53.084 --> 35:54.859
but... You got eggs inside,

35:54.953 --> 35:56.713
I can teach you a thing
or two about omelets.

35:56.921 --> 35:59.424
We'll talk after
you've eaten, okay?

35:59.924 --> 36:02.336
Look, I don't really
know much, all right?

36:02.427 --> 36:03.997
Of course not, Joyce.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.199
Not expecting miracles.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.335
Uh, uh, the only thing
I know for sure is,

36:08.433 --> 36:10.936
when I was talking to them, they
asked me a couple questions

36:11.002 --> 36:13.039
about a local boy.

36:13.138 --> 36:14.549
Uh, uh, Boyd Crowder.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.118
Boyd Crowder?

36:16.608 --> 36:18.488
Apparently, he's done
this type of thing before.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.715
Well, Joyce, that is
just ever so helpful.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.451
I thank you kindly.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.289
Rain check on that omelet?

36:25.784 --> 36:26.956
Have a lovely evening.

36:27.318 --> 36:28.558
Yeah.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.526
We're closed.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.185
But I could get you a drink.

37:34.219 --> 37:36.130
I'm Ava.
Oh, shit.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.023
Right. You're Boyd's girl.

37:38.623 --> 37:39.623
Mmm-hmm.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.364
Is he here?

37:43.862 --> 37:46.536
In the back. Let me check,
make sure it's okay.

38:03.548 --> 38:04.925
Boyd, your girl's here
to see you.

38:07.585 --> 38:10.429
Well, if by “my girl, “ you
mean my fiancee, Ava Crowder,

38:10.488 --> 38:12.627
she does not need
to be announced.

38:13.324 --> 38:14.735
Sorry, Boyd.

38:14.793 --> 38:15.965
You go on home.

38:16.594 --> 38:18.335
Lock up behind you.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.181
- Perhaps something to drink?
- Sure.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.647
That's the first time you
called me that since I got out.

38:35.747 --> 38:36.953
Your fiancee.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.855
Well, it's still true,

38:39.684 --> 38:41.425
far as I know.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.692
Ice?

38:43.421 --> 38:45.367
I'll take mine straight.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.497
Reason I came by, Boyd,

38:47.592 --> 38:50.266
is I don't like where
we left things off earlier.

38:51.429 --> 38:54.433
Well, I think you made
yourself perfectly clear.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.006
No. I didn't.

38:58.102 --> 38:59.274
But now I'm going to.

39:02.307 --> 39:05.948
I don't care that you left
that stuff in my shed, Boyd.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.683
You can...

39:07.779 --> 39:11.056
Hide gold bricks from Fort Knox
under my bed for all I care.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.689
Either we're together...

39:14.786 --> 39:15.890
Or we're not.

39:16.354 --> 39:20.325
Either I'm a pan of what
you're doing, or I'm not.

39:20.959 --> 39:24.133
Whatever you got going on,
I can handle it.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.200
Well, all right.

39:27.665 --> 39:30.305
Thank you for coming by and
making yourself doubly clear.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.137
Boyd...
I'm tired, Ava.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.472
I don't want to talk about it.
Boyd. Boyd.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.214
What I'm trying to say is,

39:39.310 --> 39:42.052
is that I can't help you
if you keep me in the dark.

39:43.748 --> 39:44.988
I know you robbed that bank,

39:45.683 --> 39:47.526
and I know you didn't get
what you wanted.

39:47.585 --> 39:49.929
Just a bunch of land deeds.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.832
But one of those deeds
wasn't like the other.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.167
Did you notice that?

39:58.529 --> 40:00.167
What do you mean?

40:02.567 --> 40:04.740
One of those deeds
was to Pizza Portal.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.740
Restaurant downtown.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.285
You remember?

40:10.575 --> 40:13.112
That building used to be.
Holy shit.

40:19.350 --> 40:20.624
My baby girl.

40:20.718 --> 40:22.220
Oh, you're a genius!

40:22.353 --> 40:23.593
Mmm.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.199
Uh, Ava, I'm...

40:27.859 --> 40:29.395
I'm sorry.

40:30.561 --> 40:33.542
I'm gonna go get us a
bottle of the good bourbon,

40:33.598 --> 40:36.272
and we gonna drink it to
the corners, baby! Whoo!

40:45.109 --> 40:46.110
Mmm.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.733
This whole thing

41:04.495 --> 41:06.600
is becoming much more work
than I thought.

41:06.664 --> 41:08.439
Still beats night recon
in Fallujah.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.972
You're setting the bar
pretty low there, Bass.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.867
You know what I was thinking about today?
What's that?

41:26.084 --> 41:28.428
The Franklin Sandwich at
Denver Biscuit company.

41:28.786 --> 41:30.697
Why would you say
shit like that?

41:30.788 --> 41:32.267
You got me drooling
all over myself.

41:32.423 --> 41:36.462
All I can say is if I have another slice
of pizza, I'm gonna lose my shit.

41:46.537 --> 41:49.518
You see what happens
if you call me a peacock?

41:58.549 --> 42:00.222
Ah, Choo-Choo.
Here you go.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.293
Well, shit.

42:04.489 --> 42:06.491
We just can't stop running
into each other, can we?

42:06.958 --> 42:08.460
We ain't running
into each other.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.563
I'm the cowboy from earlier.

42:10.661 --> 42:12.641
Yeah,
Choo-Choo was saying.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.540
You were under the impression
he was following you.

42:14.632 --> 42:16.236
Just like some folks
are under the impression

42:16.334 --> 42:18.814
you boys are here
just to sell pizzas.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.247
Where'd you get all that cash?

42:20.905 --> 42:23.715
The question is,
why would you turn it down?

42:23.808 --> 42:26.186
You're in on the take, or your
some kind of John Wayne type.

42:26.244 --> 42:27.814
Nothing going on down here.

42:27.879 --> 42:30.257
You're going around offering
large amounts of cash

42:30.348 --> 42:31.759
for properties sight unseen.

42:31.849 --> 42:33.385
All day, I've been asking
myself why.

42:33.484 --> 42:34.724
I can't figure it out.

42:34.819 --> 42:35.854
Well,
it's fairly simple, really.

42:36.187 --> 42:38.167
We believe Harlan
has a what, Seabass?

42:38.222 --> 42:39.530
A bright future.
That's right,

42:39.590 --> 42:41.194
bright future.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.567
All right.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.166
You want to buy my land,
I want to see your boss.

42:45.696 --> 42:47.403
You arrange a sit-down,
we'll talk.

42:47.498 --> 42:49.944
Makes you think
he ain't the HNIC?

42:50.902 --> 42:52.404
Well, Choo-Choo,
the way it works,

42:52.503 --> 42:54.881
whether you're in military,
law enforcement,

42:54.939 --> 42:56.850
or you sell vacuum cleaners,

42:56.908 --> 42:59.582
the boss man
don't go door-to-door.

42:59.677 --> 43:00.883
Besides, just look at him.

43:01.345 --> 43:02.688
He works for someone.

43:03.181 --> 43:05.058
My guess is, he don't
want to talk about it.

43:05.950 --> 43:07.088
Good night, kitten.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.450
You know, I haven't been in this
building since I was a kid.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.368
Mmm.
Used to be a bank.
