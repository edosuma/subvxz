Your attention, please. Flight 217
from Venice, ltaly, now arriving at Gate 34.

00:38.685 --> 00:42.621
Please claim all baggage
at carousel number two...

01:14.855 --> 01:16.379
Hot! Hot!

01:47.354 --> 01:49.015
l'll be by tomorrow for my stuff.

01:49.923 --> 01:54.121
Call first, cos l might be having sex
with a complete stranger!

01:57.264 --> 02:00.358
45 minutes for a cab. This is ridiculous.

02:00.434 --> 02:01.924
Cheese and rice!

02:06.973 --> 02:11.774
Boy, you got it in there, didn't you, honey?
Thank you so much!

02:15.415 --> 02:18.213
l need a ride.

02:18.285 --> 02:20.378
Get out of my way.

02:38.338 --> 02:40.238
Get in!

02:52.085 --> 02:54.519
Try and keep it on the road for a change.

03:07.701 --> 03:11.637
- Can't you get it any closer?
- l don't wanna scratch the paint.

03:21.648 --> 03:23.843
What do you do here, Tom Leezak?

03:23.950 --> 03:25.212
Open the gate, Yuan.

03:25.318 --> 03:28.185
You and Tom not together any more.

03:28.288 --> 03:31.018
Just open the gate, Yuan!

03:50.577 --> 03:52.238
That one looks heavy.

03:56.182 --> 03:58.548
Get thatjunk wagon out of here.

03:58.652 --> 04:00.517
Right away, princess!

04:14.034 --> 04:16.332
Not one word.

04:18.271 --> 04:22.173
- Are Mom and Dad home?
- No, they're at the Emphysema Ball.

04:22.242 --> 04:26.042
Don't worry, Peewee.
We'll get this Tom mess cleaned up.

04:30.350 --> 04:31.840
Sarah...

04:44.364 --> 04:47.060
Kyle...

05:00.880 --> 05:04.646
OK, l'm home, so you can
leave whenever you want.

05:23.770 --> 05:26.739
This is Tom and Sarah.
We can't come to the phone

05:26.806 --> 05:29.331
because we're honeymooning in Europe!

05:29.442 --> 05:34.072
Send a large wedding gift,
or we won't call you back. l'm serious.

05:35.515 --> 05:38.814
Kyle. l got your message.
Sorry the honeymoon sucked.

05:38.918 --> 05:44.151
Anyway, don't wig. When you get back,
we'll do some Budweiser therapy.

05:45.458 --> 05:48.791
Hi, Sarah, it's Peter.
l thought l might catch you in.

05:48.862 --> 05:52.593
Tom, if you're listening, buddy,
l feel your pain.

06:00.473 --> 06:05.308
- Where you been, man? You're on in five.
- l walked over. l had to clear my head.

06:05.378 --> 06:07.346
So? What happened?

06:07.447 --> 06:11.543
Well, l had the perfect relationship
that was ruined by marriage.

06:11.651 --> 06:15.644
You saw it, right? We were perfect
from the minute we met. Right?

06:15.722 --> 06:19.818
Yeah. ln fact, it was nauseating.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.187
Thank you, Fred.

06:27.167 --> 06:30.625
Blue 28! Blue 28!

06:30.704 --> 06:33.639
Set! Hut!

06:35.141 --> 06:36.904
l'm open! l'm open!

06:39.813 --> 06:41.405
Football!

06:46.186 --> 06:47.380
Sorry!

06:48.922 --> 06:50.389
Are you OK?

06:50.490 --> 06:53.391
Yeah. You had nothin' on it.

07:00.066 --> 07:02.830
Cheers, Sarah McNerney.

07:02.902 --> 07:05.530
Cheers, Tom Leezak.

07:08.708 --> 07:11.506
So, what do you do
when you're not Joe Montana?

07:11.578 --> 07:14.570
l work at KNR Radio,

07:14.681 --> 07:17.844
your traffic information station.

07:18.718 --> 07:21.243
So l have myself a real live radio host?

07:21.354 --> 07:25.518
No. Someday l'll be that guy.
Sports, hopefully.

07:25.592 --> 07:28.356
Right now, l just do spot traffic reports.

07:28.428 --> 07:31.955
On the graveyard shift. Every other week.

07:32.065 --> 07:35.091
When the full-time guy's sick.

07:35.201 --> 07:38.364
- You're that Tom.
- Yeah. You heard me on the air?

07:38.438 --> 07:41.635
Yeah, l called in about a week ago.
Like, 3:00am.

07:41.741 --> 07:44.904
You said the Pasadena freeway
was clear, so l took it,

07:44.978 --> 07:51.247
and got stuck behind ajackknifed big rig
for, like, three hours. Yeah.

07:51.317 --> 07:53.444
Sarah from Beverly Hills.

07:54.387 --> 07:57.254
Who called me a fathead.

07:58.057 --> 08:00.252
We got pretty heated.

08:00.326 --> 08:01.816
Very heated.

08:04.430 --> 08:07.558
So, 3am? That's past your bedtime, is it?

08:07.634 --> 08:12.469
How do you know? l was wrapping out
an auction. l'm a gofer at Sotheby's.

08:12.572 --> 08:17.271
Let me guess: marketing major, Stanford.
Smartypants in the front row.

08:17.343 --> 08:21.177
- Art history major, Wellesley, back row.
- Oh, back row.

08:21.281 --> 08:24.910
Sweet! Me too. Communications,
Burbank Community College.

08:24.984 --> 08:27.282
- Wanna hear the fight song?
- No, thank you.

08:27.353 --> 08:29.753
- l'm really good at it.
- No, really. Thanks.

08:29.823 --> 08:31.916
That's a good choice.

08:32.926 --> 08:35.155
McNerney.

08:35.260 --> 08:39.698
You're not, by any chance,
the daughter of Dan McNerney,

08:39.799 --> 08:43.962
part-owner-of-the-Lakers-and-Dodgers
McNerney?

08:44.971 --> 08:46.802
l'll take that as a yes.

08:47.373 --> 08:49.864
Ready to get your ass kicked at eight-ball?

08:51.611 --> 08:55.707
You are dreaming, Wellesley.
l went to day care in a pool hall.

08:56.549 --> 08:58.642
Pretty confident there, huh, fathead?

09:06.326 --> 09:08.886
Bags, shh.

09:52.171 --> 09:55.732
And that was it.
A month later, we moved in together.

09:57.210 --> 10:01.909
Why did we get married when we had loving
each other so completely nailed?

10:02.015 --> 10:04.006
l don't know. Ten seconds.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.710
Why does anyone get married?

10:05.785 --> 10:11.280
l mean, does it make sense to be
with one person for your entire life?

10:12.425 --> 10:15.189
People change. They grow.

10:15.261 --> 10:16.353
You're on, Tom.

10:17.196 --> 10:21.462
Maybe we'd still be together if l'd
gotten the proposal right, but, nope,

10:21.567 --> 10:24.127
the proposal is critical, and l blew it.

10:29.943 --> 10:36.212
This is Tom Leezak
with KNR traffic at 2:06am.

10:36.282 --> 10:41.743
At this hour, there are approximately
seven vehicles on all Southland freeways,

10:41.821 --> 10:46.656
so if you feel like skateboarding
down the 405, she's wide-open.

10:46.759 --> 10:50.286
Stay tuned for another
traffic update in ten minutes

10:50.396 --> 10:55.766
on KNR, your traffic information station.

10:56.803 --> 11:00.637
And we're out. Look here, Tom.
You gotta focus, all right, man?

11:01.174 --> 11:05.076
Forget about proposals.
Forget about marriage. All right?

11:12.185 --> 11:13.743
Bags...

11:16.522 --> 11:21.425
Do you have to grunt all the time?
You're just like a little pig with hair.

11:23.029 --> 11:26.521
Look at me.
l'm the cutest doggy in the world.

11:26.632 --> 11:31.968
l'm the cutest doggy in the world. Throw
the ball for me. l'll pull on your leg all day.

11:32.038 --> 11:34.700
Bags, seriously, l will...

11:34.807 --> 11:36.468
Bags, l'm reading.

11:40.513 --> 11:42.037
Fetch.

11:52.859 --> 11:55.293
lt wasn't like Bags to chase pigeons.

11:58.064 --> 12:01.033
This pigeon was cruel. lt was...

12:02.835 --> 12:07.169
Bags, he just went for him.

12:08.307 --> 12:10.366
He was taunting.

12:11.911 --> 12:15.540
And squawking.

12:15.648 --> 12:18.378
Squawking?

12:18.484 --> 12:20.918
Squawking.

12:21.020 --> 12:24.421
l mean, at first, it was more of a purring.

12:25.658 --> 12:28.855
You know how they...
l mean, Bags... lt got his attention.

12:28.928 --> 12:31.488
He has a low tolerance for annoyances.

12:31.564 --> 12:34.829
But then it turned into this, like, shrill...

12:47.380 --> 12:49.439
You're lying.

12:50.450 --> 12:54.113
- What?
- Your nostrils always flare when you lie.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.450
Flare! Flare!

12:56.556 --> 13:00.356
They're not flaring. l'm not lying.

13:04.363 --> 13:09.391
Honey, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
l'm just really overwhelmed.

13:10.870 --> 13:13.896
Promise we'll never lie to each other.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.809
lt's a promise.

13:25.284 --> 13:27.809
l love you so much.

13:33.826 --> 13:36.090
Listen, Sarah...

13:36.629 --> 13:39.598
l wanna marry you, Tom Leezak.

13:42.435 --> 13:44.562
l wanna marry you, too.

13:56.082 --> 14:00.246
Why do you bring Dodge to front?
Park at service entrance!

14:00.319 --> 14:02.947
Open the gate, Yuan.

14:04.490 --> 14:05.957
Here we go!

14:19.205 --> 14:21.867
Well, well, well...

14:24.010 --> 14:26.444
What a surprise.

14:34.887 --> 14:38.846
- Welcome to the family, Tom.
- Thank you, Mrs McNerney.

14:39.225 --> 14:41.284
Oh, you can call me Pussy now.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.887
Thank you, Pussy.

14:44.997 --> 14:49.127
Well, wonderful. Wonderful!

14:49.202 --> 14:51.796
Yuan, champagne for everybody!

14:53.706 --> 14:55.401
Knock it off, Dickie!

14:56.709 --> 15:01.476
Peewee. My youngest daughter.

15:01.547 --> 15:03.913
You little rebel.

15:05.017 --> 15:08.180
And you, Tom Leezak. You're...

15:09.021 --> 15:11.854
Well, wonderful surprise.

15:12.725 --> 15:14.886
Thank you, Mr McNerney.

15:14.994 --> 15:18.691
l just hope that l can

15:18.764 --> 15:23.030
be just all that l can be

15:24.770 --> 15:27.864
in this family.

15:34.380 --> 15:37.713
Well, l love Sarah.

15:37.783 --> 15:39.614
That's all l need to know.

15:41.554 --> 15:44.751
You really missed the boat,
didn't you, Prentiss?

15:44.857 --> 15:45.949
Yes, l did, Dan.

15:46.058 --> 15:48.458
You bet your ass you did.

15:48.561 --> 15:53.225
l should've been courting Sarah instead
of putting in 19-hour days at the office.

15:53.299 --> 15:57.201
Anyway, congratulations. To both of you.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.704
Seriously, from my heart.

15:59.772 --> 16:01.865
Thank you, Peter.

16:02.742 --> 16:06.143
- You're a lucky man.
- Hey, l know that.

16:06.245 --> 16:08.304
Grab a flute of bubbly and rise.

16:11.217 --> 16:13.117
Everybody ready?

16:13.486 --> 16:17.388
- Why is Peter Prentiss here?
- Dad's doing business with him.

16:17.456 --> 16:20.823
All right. Health, wealth, happiness.

16:20.926 --> 16:23.486
Health, wealth, happiness.

16:24.664 --> 16:27.997
All right, Peewee. Ten-yard out.

16:28.100 --> 16:33.663
Leezak, give me a five-yard slant.
You got this, man. Don't worry about it.

16:33.773 --> 16:35.934
- Calm down.
- What do you mean, calm down?

16:36.008 --> 16:40.968
Why do bad things happen to good people,
Father? Where's that in your book?

16:41.080 --> 16:43.412
- She's determined.
- Not even Catholic!

16:43.482 --> 16:47.418
- He's a Polack! A Polack.
- l know, and l warned you...

16:47.486 --> 16:49.818
Let's see what Leezak's packing.

16:49.922 --> 16:52.584
Ready? All right. And break!

16:53.159 --> 16:55.252
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

16:59.131 --> 17:01.759
You girls ready for this?

17:03.369 --> 17:04.631
Down!

17:06.872 --> 17:07.930
Set!

17:13.212 --> 17:14.941
That was a hard one.

17:15.681 --> 17:17.705
- Yeah!
- That's what l'm talkin' about!

17:17.817 --> 17:19.978
- What are you doing, Willie?
- l slipped.

17:21.854 --> 17:25.619
l still got my flag. l'm good. l'm good.

17:26.992 --> 17:30.155
Oh, my Peewee. Always moving so fast.

17:30.229 --> 17:35.292
You move in together after a month,
live together for nine months,

17:35.368 --> 17:37.962
and now you're engaged.

17:38.037 --> 17:40.699
l know you love him, but, you know,

17:40.806 --> 17:45.743
sometimes it takes more than love
to sustain a marriage.

17:47.413 --> 17:49.973
You need to be old enough
to know who you are

17:50.049 --> 17:52.176
and what you want and who he is.

17:52.251 --> 17:55.812
Oh, Mom, he's wild and spontaneous

17:55.888 --> 17:58.413
and hysterical and offbeat,

17:58.524 --> 18:02.392
and on top of all that,
he's centered, and he's down-to-earth.

18:02.495 --> 18:06.898
He's everything l want. And we have
this passion for each other that's...

18:11.570 --> 18:13.435
l'm jealous.

18:15.374 --> 18:18.605
All right. First thing tomorrow,

18:21.046 --> 18:23.537
we're gonna plan this wedding!

18:48.107 --> 18:49.369
Hey, you.

19:04.490 --> 19:07.789
So l guess everyone thinks
we're crazy for doing this.

19:07.893 --> 19:11.420
Now when did we start caring
about what other people think?

19:13.299 --> 19:18.965
Well, are you sure that you don't
wanna marry a guy like Peter?

19:20.306 --> 19:26.006
lf l wanted to know exactly what
my life would be from hereon out,

19:26.111 --> 19:29.603
l would marry a guy like Peter.

19:29.682 --> 19:32.412
But l love not knowing.

19:32.485 --> 19:38.185
l love our messy loft, your beater car.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.027
l wanna start a life with you.

19:44.129 --> 19:45.528
Sarah?

19:45.631 --> 19:47.929
Go! Go!

19:51.504 --> 19:53.438
Hi, Daddy.

19:57.510 --> 20:03.107
Peewee, marriage is like
a business investment.

20:03.182 --> 20:09.178
lts long-term viability
is best established unemotionally.

20:09.288 --> 20:14.225
Bottom line, Daddy: we love each other.
That is all that matters.

20:29.675 --> 20:30.835
Good night, sir.

20:34.813 --> 20:37.247
Congratulations, Mr Leezak!

20:37.349 --> 20:40.648
Big Daddy Leezak's in the house!

20:42.655 --> 20:45.215
Oh, l hope she doesn't spook on you, man.

20:46.091 --> 20:47.649
What do you mean?

20:47.726 --> 20:52.390
l love Sarah, don't get me wrong.
But rich chicks spook.

20:52.498 --> 20:56.696
A powerful daddy plus family money
equals expectations.

20:56.769 --> 21:00.170
Expectations are like
a fungal rot on a marriage.

21:01.206 --> 21:04.266
Our marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot.

21:04.376 --> 21:08.244
We're gonna be happily married
every day for the rest of our lives.

21:09.582 --> 21:13.780
Unless she finds out
that you slaughtered her dog.

21:13.886 --> 21:15.786
l'll take that to my grave.

21:22.227 --> 21:26.755
OK, if you change your mind
at the altar, just pass out.

21:26.865 --> 21:29.390
l'm not going to change my mind.

21:29.468 --> 21:32.869
l'm just saying, if you do, just hit the floor.

21:32.938 --> 21:35.566
Thank you. But it's not gonna happen.

21:36.208 --> 21:39.075
You're sure you're ready
to give up your grazing rights?

21:39.144 --> 21:40.873
l'm not a grazer, Kyle.

21:40.946 --> 21:43.312
What if you became one later in life?

21:43.415 --> 21:48.785
l mean, over the next ten years,
you're giving up five hayrides per year.

21:48.887 --> 21:53.085
So l can either be happily married
to Sarah, or have 50 one-night stands.

21:53.158 --> 21:56.924
- Minimum.
- That's not even a choice.

21:58.597 --> 22:01.464
OK, let's move on.

22:01.567 --> 22:05.333
Are there any chicks you didn't have
that you wish you had?

22:05.437 --> 22:07.735
You are, like, the worst best man ever!

22:07.806 --> 22:09.467
Peter!

22:11.610 --> 22:14.101
l can't believe she invited Prentiss.

22:14.179 --> 22:16.739
- Glad you made it, buddy.
- Hey, man.

22:16.815 --> 22:19.750
Did she ever hook up with that yahoo?

22:21.086 --> 22:24.852
They went backpacking in Europe once,
just after high school.

22:24.957 --> 22:27.585
l don't think anything happened.

22:27.660 --> 22:33.929
Whoa. You're getting married,
and she didn't share the roster?

22:35.868 --> 22:37.927
She shared the roster.

22:40.773 --> 22:44.004
Merrick and Bruce.

22:48.981 --> 22:50.881
What about Prentiss?

22:54.853 --> 22:57.549
And you never asked again?

22:57.656 --> 23:00.648
l won. lt's irrelevant.

23:02.628 --> 23:08.498
Oh. OK. As long as you're OK
with a bogus roster.

23:08.567 --> 23:11.229
- lt's not a bogus roster!
- ls he on or is he off?

23:11.336 --> 23:12.860
He's...

23:14.173 --> 23:16.232
- Shut up.
- Huh? Huh?

23:20.579 --> 23:22.171
And you could've had Peter.

23:22.247 --> 23:24.977
l did have Peter, and it wasn't that hot. OK?

23:26.785 --> 23:29.276
Excuse me?

23:29.354 --> 23:32.619
l was in Seattle, helping at an appraisal.

23:32.691 --> 23:36.320
Ran into Peter. We went out.
l drank way too much,

23:36.395 --> 23:41.298
and before l knew it, we tussled.

23:41.834 --> 23:44.462
You bad girl.

23:45.070 --> 23:48.836
l wanted to tell Tom so many times,
but he gets so jealous.

23:48.907 --> 23:51.740
Listen, it doesn't matter
that he doesn't know.

23:51.844 --> 23:54.642
lt's not like you were married,
and even if you were...

23:54.713 --> 23:57.409
No, no, no. lt matters to me.

23:57.516 --> 24:01.350
lt's like living a lie. l cannot live a lie.

24:01.420 --> 24:05.550
There will always be this
big fat elephant in the room with us.

24:05.657 --> 24:08.319
Listen, Peewee, never tell him.

24:10.863 --> 24:12.490
lt's time to go, Sarah.

24:14.099 --> 24:16.192
Come on.

24:17.369 --> 24:18.859
- Got everything?
- Yes.

24:18.937 --> 24:20.234
How are you holding up?

24:20.339 --> 24:23.331
Pussy's a mess.
l'm telling you now, be prepared.

24:59.978 --> 25:01.570
Wait.

25:09.755 --> 25:11.552
- Oh, are you OK?
- Yes.

25:11.623 --> 25:14.717
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

25:14.793 --> 25:17.660
This threshold thing isn't as easy as it looks.

25:25.838 --> 25:30.104
Daddy got the big suite! Yeah, he did!

25:37.816 --> 25:40.910
We're really married.
We're really, really married.

25:40.986 --> 25:43.079
For ever and ever.

25:45.757 --> 25:47.952
Do you feel like it?

25:48.026 --> 25:51.086
l don't know. Do you?

25:53.365 --> 25:55.856
l'm kinda tired.

25:57.002 --> 25:59.095
Me too.

26:00.172 --> 26:02.470
- l mean, hey...
- OK.

26:13.518 --> 26:15.611
What's the matter?

26:17.022 --> 26:20.219
lt's our wedding night,
and we don't wanna have sex.

26:21.193 --> 26:24.321
No... Well, it's OK.

26:25.631 --> 26:28.862
We're tired. lt's fine.

26:28.967 --> 26:31.629
Baby, it's just that this is our wedding day,

26:31.703 --> 26:34.570
something l've fantasized
about my whole life.

26:38.577 --> 26:41.045
And now it's over.

26:45.183 --> 26:48.983
Did you have wedding fantasies
when you were a little boy?

26:55.260 --> 26:56.693
Kinda.

26:56.762 --> 26:59.253
Oh, honey.

26:59.364 --> 27:03.733
Oh, my God! Tomorrow my parents
are gonna know l'm not a virgin any more!

27:05.938 --> 27:09.169
Oh... You haven't been
a virgin since college.

27:09.241 --> 27:13.940
l know. l know. But tomorrow they're
gonna know for sure that l'm not a virgin.

27:14.046 --> 27:18.506
And they're gonna know
that you deflowered me. Oh, God! Oh, no!

27:18.583 --> 27:20.380
- Oh, honey!
- Deflowered?

27:20.452 --> 27:23.444
That's what my mom always called it.
My mommy.

27:31.096 --> 27:34.122
l love you. OK?

27:34.232 --> 27:39.363
And we have our entire lives to have sex.

27:40.405 --> 27:43.966
So it's OK if we don't do it tonight.

27:49.915 --> 27:51.576
Now l kinda feel like it.

27:51.650 --> 27:54.141
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:54.252 --> 27:56.117
That was a sexy speech.

27:56.221 --> 28:00.214
l, you know, turn it on
every once in a while.

28:04.129 --> 28:06.222
Oh, bloody nose! Bloody nose!

28:06.298 --> 28:09.495
Oh, hello, hello! Hello, hello!

28:09.601 --> 28:11.660
Here you go.

28:14.072 --> 28:17.940
You've been mine for one night,
and you're falling apart already.

28:18.010 --> 28:20.740
l'm not gonna have to trade ya in, am l?

28:23.281 --> 28:26.978
There you go. Just like that.
lt'll stop the bleeding.

28:29.321 --> 28:31.482
l look like a chimp.

28:33.492 --> 28:35.585
You look gorgeous.

28:37.496 --> 28:39.930
Let's go to sleep.

28:42.501 --> 28:45.436
- l love you.
- l love you, too, baby.

29:38.890 --> 29:41.415
Sweetie, our plane leaves in an hour.

29:48.033 --> 29:51.560
OK, so that wasn't
the smoothest start to a honeymoon.

29:52.437 --> 29:58.103
But tomorrow we will be at the foot
of the Alps at the Hôtel des Rêves.

29:58.210 --> 30:00.701
- Yes, we will.
- lt'll be totally perfect.

30:00.779 --> 30:03.771
Yes, it sounds totally perfect.

30:06.751 --> 30:08.844
But l can't wait until then.

30:23.768 --> 30:25.861
Jimmy-crack-corn!

30:31.910 --> 30:34.037
Close it, bitch!

30:36.882 --> 30:39.407
There's a lock on the door
for a reason, Junior.

30:39.484 --> 30:42.078
l'm claustrophobic, OK?

30:42.154 --> 30:43.314
Do we have a problem?

30:43.421 --> 30:44.979
- No.
- No, no problem.

30:45.090 --> 30:46.887
- We're just waiting.
- Yeah.

30:56.735 --> 31:01.104
Mexican food. That's an oxymoron.

31:06.945 --> 31:09.812
Sweet Lord! Where does that come from?

31:09.915 --> 31:11.906
- Let's just wait.
- Oh, my gosh.

31:11.983 --> 31:15.646
..has turned on the ''fasten seat belt'' sign.

31:15.754 --> 31:17.779
Kindly return to your seats.

31:17.856 --> 31:21.690
OK... Breathe through your mouth.
Breathe through your mouth.

31:21.793 --> 31:24.091
- No, it's really bad.
- Just do it!

31:28.466 --> 31:29.660
Hurry up!

31:33.438 --> 31:35.872
OK, OK, let me just...

31:43.515 --> 31:46.143
This is gonna work. This is gonna work.

31:47.352 --> 31:50.321
- l'm gonna step on the toilet.
- OK, perfect.

31:59.831 --> 32:02.664
- What?
- The crapper's got my foot.

32:02.734 --> 32:04.702
- Wait. Let me help.
- Sarah...

32:04.803 --> 32:07.397
OK, OK, one, two, three.

32:13.011 --> 32:14.342
Return to your seats.

32:14.412 --> 32:16.846
- Be right out. OK, you OK?
- Yeah.

32:16.915 --> 32:20.214
OK, wait. OK, one, two, three.

32:21.219 --> 32:23.710
Return to your seats now, please.

32:23.822 --> 32:26.052
Beat it, stew!

32:28.493 --> 32:29.983
Return...

32:33.565 --> 32:38.434
Playtime is over, children.
Return to your seats! Do you hear me?

32:38.536 --> 32:40.231
- Let's flush it.
- l'll pull.

32:44.909 --> 32:46.206
l can't get it out!

32:46.278 --> 32:49.076
The captain has turned on
the ''fasten seat belt'' sign!

32:49.180 --> 32:52.047
Wait, wait, wait. Here.
Ready? One, two, three.

33:03.295 --> 33:08.028
- We can tell the grandchildren about that.
- Great story for the kids.

33:12.737 --> 33:14.967
- Bonjour.
- How you doing, chief?

33:15.073 --> 33:18.065
Can we get le car for Leezak?

33:19.277 --> 33:23.407
Bonjour. Les réservations sont pour Leezak.

33:23.481 --> 33:25.574
Oui, mademoiselle.

33:26.251 --> 33:30.711
- You never told me you spoke French.
- lt was that summer l went to Europe.

33:30.789 --> 33:34.247
Ah, here we are. For Mr and Mrs Leezak.

33:34.326 --> 33:36.590
Must be some mistake, no?

33:36.661 --> 33:38.754
No, no mistake. Mr and Mrs.

33:40.799 --> 33:41.891
What the hell?

33:41.966 --> 33:45.129
- These sports scores are two days old.
- So?

33:45.236 --> 33:48.899
So? You know if l don't have
an up-to-date sports section,

33:48.973 --> 33:51.965
it throws off my day,
starting with my morning dump.

33:52.077 --> 33:55.444
Honey, there's gonna be
satellite TV in the hotel.

33:59.317 --> 34:00.648
Voilà.

34:00.752 --> 34:03.846
Ah. l wonder what kind of wheels we got.

34:05.023 --> 34:08.754
l'm telling you, this is not the car.
l ordered a compact.

34:08.827 --> 34:10.351
This is a European compact.

34:10.462 --> 34:14.420
This is a Ringling Brothers compact.
l've owned bigger Tonka trucks.

34:14.498 --> 34:16.763
Honey, l looked at the brochure,

34:16.835 --> 34:21.670
and there was a Fiesta
on the cover, not a Bingo.

34:23.308 --> 34:26.471
Baby needs a great big car
to make him happy?

34:26.543 --> 34:29.672
We could really use a Dodge about now.

34:29.781 --> 34:33.148
We could really use a Dodge about now.

34:34.786 --> 34:36.275
What was that?

34:36.353 --> 34:38.219
You just sound so American.

34:38.322 --> 34:41.224
We could use a Dodge about now.

34:41.326 --> 34:44.556
While l'm makin' a doody,
can you hand me my sports section?

34:44.661 --> 34:46.652
Thank you very much, ma'am.

34:47.799 --> 34:49.960
Are you mocking me?

34:50.034 --> 34:52.502
No. Baby, just floor it.

34:52.570 --> 34:57.007
l am flooring it. lf l pushed any harder,
my foot would blow through the floor,

34:57.074 --> 34:59.339
and we'd be Flintstoning there.

34:59.411 --> 35:01.572
Whoa, turn here!

35:09.988 --> 35:11.353
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?

35:15.660 --> 35:20.757
lf you'd told me about the turn before, l
wouldn't have had to pull such a maneuver!

35:20.865 --> 35:24.528
l was busy looking at the map!
Somebody had to navigate.

35:31.609 --> 35:35.739
Listen to us. We sound
like an old married couple.

35:38.049 --> 35:40.108
Never again.

35:46.891 --> 35:50.952
Just for the record, why did l
almost get us killed back there?

35:51.863 --> 35:53.956
Because that's our hotel.

35:55.233 --> 35:58.964
- lt looks like a castle.
- lt is a castle.

35:59.070 --> 36:02.039
Then that's precisely why it looks like one.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.604
Let's go.

36:25.296 --> 36:29.824
This is the most beautiful thing l've ever seen.

36:31.669 --> 36:33.762
Let's go.

36:47.485 --> 36:51.649
Look, baby, look. lt comes with free nuns.

37:11.943 --> 37:13.968
- Vous êtes Américains?
- Oui.

37:14.045 --> 37:17.173
Welcome to Hôtel des Rêves.
l am Henri Margeaux.

37:17.282 --> 37:19.682
Nous sommes Sarah et Tom Leezak.

37:19.784 --> 37:21.149
- Leezak, no!
- Oui.

37:21.219 --> 37:23.119
- The honeymooners?
- Oui.

37:23.187 --> 37:25.951
- No!
- Oui. Why?

37:26.024 --> 37:29.790
So fresh and young to have marriage, no?

37:29.861 --> 37:31.954
No. We're married.

37:32.397 --> 37:35.059
l almost forget.

37:35.166 --> 37:37.794
Ooh, presents.

37:37.869 --> 37:41.327
''Congratulations.
Have a wonderful honeymoon. Love...

37:42.073 --> 37:44.007
Peter.''

37:44.075 --> 37:46.669
That's a platonic ''love.''

37:48.313 --> 37:50.713
Forget about Peter.

37:50.815 --> 37:52.874
Here. Please enjoy.

37:54.052 --> 37:56.680
Room, all upstairs.

37:56.754 --> 37:59.848
François, les bagages, en haut.
Tout de suite, s'il vous plaît.

38:09.534 --> 38:11.866
Tell me this isn't your fantasy.

38:14.539 --> 38:16.336
This is better than my fantasy.

38:16.407 --> 38:18.898
Good, cos we're paying out the ass for it.

38:19.010 --> 38:22.207
Honey, just for the record,
when you talk about money,

38:22.280 --> 38:27.582
especially it coming out of your heinie,
it sort of kills the romance of the moment.

38:28.219 --> 38:30.016
Right. Sorry.

38:32.790 --> 38:37.955
Now fight your deep urge to be cheap,
and give the bellboy a large tip.

38:38.062 --> 38:39.222
All right.

38:39.297 --> 38:43.859
- Hey, do you guys provide satellite TV?
- TV in bar.

38:45.303 --> 38:49.103
- So there's no TV in this room?
- TV in bar.

38:52.310 --> 38:55.404
- Ask him if they have ESPN.
- Pour l'amour de Dieu.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.711
Je lui ai dit, à monsieur,
que la télé est dans le bar.

38:59.050 --> 39:03.578
Je crois que sa femme n'est pas vous.
C'est la télé.

39:06.391 --> 39:09.087
He said the TV's in the bar.

39:13.231 --> 39:17.964
He also said that if he were here with me,
he wouldn't be concerned with TV.

39:20.004 --> 39:21.494
He makes a point.

39:21.606 --> 39:26.134
- l gotta call Mom and Dad.
- Talk about killing the romance.

39:26.244 --> 39:29.145
l told them l'd call. lt'll just take a minute.

39:31.082 --> 39:33.482
Hi, Mom? lt's Peewee.

39:33.584 --> 39:35.415
Say hi to Pussy for me.

39:39.323 --> 39:41.052
Tom says hello.

39:41.492 --> 39:44.086
Yeah. Oh, it's so great.

39:46.864 --> 39:52.166
''To Tom and Sarah.
Enhance thy honeymoon. Love, Kyle.''

39:52.770 --> 39:54.829
l'll call you later, Mom. Bye.

39:56.207 --> 39:59.438
Cheese and rice.
ls that a Thunderstick A200?

39:59.510 --> 40:01.375
Since when did you become an expert?

40:01.479 --> 40:05.711
- l told you about that night l had in college.
- Not about the hardware.

40:05.817 --> 40:08.047
Getting a visual?

40:09.487 --> 40:11.955
We gotta charge this thing.

40:19.831 --> 40:24.291
- That plug won't fit in a European outlet.
- l'll make it fit.

40:27.472 --> 40:28.666
Come on.

40:28.740 --> 40:29.798
Don't force it.

40:42.220 --> 40:44.085
Are you OK? Are you OK?

40:44.188 --> 40:48.921
Holy dude Jesus. Good thing that
didn't happen when we were using it.

40:51.329 --> 40:52.421
Oh, God.

40:52.530 --> 40:55.931
Allez dans la cour,
s'il vous plaît, tout de suite.

40:56.033 --> 40:58.399
Come on! Come on, Thunderstick!

40:58.503 --> 41:02.098
- Oh, no. OK, just leave it.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

41:29.200 --> 41:33.796
My grandparents
installed the wiring in the hotel

41:33.905 --> 41:36.635
before World War First!

41:38.609 --> 41:44.605
lt worked fine, until you young kids had
to bring out your toys and ignore the sign!

41:50.154 --> 41:52.782
That is the...

41:52.890 --> 41:56.917
- That's in French, for chrissakes.
- That's because we're in France.

41:56.994 --> 42:00.293
- ls there anything we could do?
- Pay the damages.

42:00.398 --> 42:01.763
Hold on there, Jacques.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.734
Je m'appelle Henri Margeaux.

42:04.802 --> 42:09.136
Whatever! Look, this hotel gets
guests from all over the world.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.232
lt's your responsibility
to put American on your signs.

42:12.310 --> 42:13.641
He means English.

42:13.744 --> 42:16.338
l'm trying to negotiate.

42:16.447 --> 42:18.642
So l must make my hotel of dreams

42:18.749 --> 42:21.775
like every Howard Johnson's,
with a bright orange roof?

42:21.853 --> 42:25.186
- lt wouldn't hurt.
- lmbécile de cochon d'Américain.

42:25.289 --> 42:28.486
- Cochon what?
- Stupid American pig.

42:32.530 --> 42:38.162
Well, l guess that makes you
a stupid French frog!

42:38.269 --> 42:40.294
Oh, yeah. l said it. Frog!

42:40.371 --> 42:42.635
Get out of my Hôtel des Rêves!

42:42.707 --> 42:46.143
l wouldn't stay in this dump if you paid us!

42:47.011 --> 42:49.878
- Let's go to the Ho Jo's.
- There are no Ho Jo's here.

42:49.981 --> 42:51.710
Sarah, please!

42:51.816 --> 42:56.116
There is a farm up the road.
And they have a nice pigsty for you!

42:56.187 --> 42:59.384
Yeah? Maybe they'll have
a nice little bulldozer,

42:59.490 --> 43:02.721
and we can finish this place off, tough guy!

43:02.827 --> 43:06.319
And the credit bill will be
a fat one, Mr Tough Guy!

43:06.397 --> 43:11.027
Yeah? Well, we're keeping the champagne
and the cheese, Jacques-strap!

43:12.737 --> 43:14.364
Let's go, honey.

43:16.173 --> 43:18.232
What's wrong?

43:19.310 --> 43:22.040
Where are we gonna stay, Tom?

43:22.146 --> 43:25.673
Don't worry. This is a vacation zone.
We'll find a place.

43:25.750 --> 43:27.718
Now get your shit. Let's go.

43:28.819 --> 43:30.719
What's the next place?

43:30.821 --> 43:36.851
The next hotel with no vacancy
would be Schloss Hilliger Winterswald.

43:36.928 --> 43:39.897
- How far is it?
- 120 kilometers.

43:39.997 --> 43:41.931
ln miles, please!

43:42.033 --> 43:45.059
74.4. You multiply by 0.6.

43:45.169 --> 43:49.071
- l'm learning so much.
- Oh, me too. Me too.

43:56.013 --> 43:57.605
Let me guess...

44:04.388 --> 44:06.948
This is great. This is just what we need.

44:07.058 --> 44:10.892
- Do you want me to drive?
- Honey, l can drive in the snow.

44:13.631 --> 44:15.929
Turn off your brights, jackass!

44:48.099 --> 44:52.263
Great. Now we get to freeze to death.

44:55.106 --> 45:00.601
Look, we'll just... We'll sleep in here
and we'll dig out in the morning.

45:00.678 --> 45:04.671
l'm so glad l get to hear the phrase
''We'll dig out'' on my honeymoon.

45:10.021 --> 45:12.489
Just get it over with now and blame me.

45:12.590 --> 45:17.584
lf you hadn't insulted Henri, we wouldn't
be spending the evening in a snowball.

45:17.661 --> 45:23.258
l'm sorry. Next time, l'll try to be a little
bit more refined like your friend Peter.

45:23.334 --> 45:26.132
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night, Sarah.

46:02.173 --> 46:04.368
Are you gonna hate me for ever?

46:07.078 --> 46:09.376
l don't know.

46:13.350 --> 46:15.011
Wanna get drunk and make out?

46:15.086 --> 46:18.886
Well, that's not gonna get me drunk,
but we could make out.

46:24.228 --> 46:27.322
We could get injured doing this.

46:27.398 --> 46:31.027
l'll settle for a cuddle.
Just let me get the shifter out of my ass.

46:42.079 --> 46:45.173
Sarah... lt's morning.

47:04.902 --> 47:07.097
Oh, my God.

47:10.741 --> 47:12.868
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

47:12.943 --> 47:14.774
lt's incredible.

47:15.212 --> 47:19.706
- Let's just stay here for the rest of the trip.
- Fine with me.

47:26.991 --> 47:29.118
- Hey! Help!
- Excuse me!

47:33.497 --> 47:36.091
Blue car, blue car!

47:37.168 --> 47:38.066
lt worked.

48:10.267 --> 48:14.101
We can catch the two o'clock train to Venice
and go straight to the Gianna.

48:14.171 --> 48:18.198
- Our reservation isn't until Tuesday.
- So we'll stay a few extra days.

48:18.309 --> 48:20.675
l just put a castle on my credit card.

48:20.778 --> 48:24.043
We can't afford to stay at the Gianna
for a few extra days.

48:24.148 --> 48:27.140
So l'll call my dad up,
and he'll lend us the money.

48:27.218 --> 48:30.517
No, there's no way
l'm taking money from your dad.

48:30.621 --> 48:32.987
Pride is the crutch of the insecure.

48:33.057 --> 48:35.890
You are not taking the money.
l am taking the money.

48:35.993 --> 48:40.191
No, we don't need to take the money.
This is about us now.

48:40.297 --> 48:44.063
My dad told me about this
nice little pensione in Venice...

48:44.168 --> 48:45.396
Pensione?

48:45.502 --> 48:48.630
- GroBes ScheiBhaus.
- Excuse me.

48:48.706 --> 48:50.674
Could you just drive?

48:50.741 --> 48:52.402
Please just let me call my dad.

48:52.509 --> 48:55.740
No! This is our honeymoon, not his.

48:55.846 --> 48:59.543
So it's fine to stay at a pensione
that your father recommended?

48:59.650 --> 49:03.586
We're staying at the Pensione Funicello,
and we'll have a good time.

49:03.687 --> 49:07.885
l can't take this any more! Honeymoons
are supposed to be all champagne

49:07.992 --> 49:11.758
and room service and lovemaking!
We haven't made love!

49:11.862 --> 49:14.922
No. What do we get?
We get evicted from a five-star hotel

49:15.032 --> 49:18.900
and, to boot, l'm yelling at you!
We're yelling at each other.

49:19.003 --> 49:23.736
We're not yelling at each other. l'm
the one yelling. l'm sorry, l wanna go home.

49:23.841 --> 49:25.706
Maybe we should go home.

49:25.776 --> 49:29.212
l know this honeymoon hasn't been perfect,

49:29.280 --> 49:34.013
but l'm sure the pensione is gonna be fine.
Look, we'll check in, sleep late,

49:34.084 --> 49:37.884
eat pasta, gaze out at the Piazza del...

49:39.123 --> 49:41.216
something-something.

49:42.126 --> 49:43.559
lt's gonna be heaven.

49:54.204 --> 49:56.570
Pensione Funicello?

50:00.978 --> 50:03.310
Are you sure?

50:05.616 --> 50:07.413
How bad could it be?

50:11.255 --> 50:13.120
Aw, crap.

50:20.631 --> 50:22.895
We're in this together, right?

50:25.069 --> 50:28.766
Do you have four men staring
at your boobies right now?

50:34.478 --> 50:35.911
No.

51:12.516 --> 51:14.347
Yeah, just...

51:14.451 --> 51:18.114
You know, we'll try it for one night,
and if we don't...

51:18.188 --> 51:20.452
Live.

51:20.524 --> 51:26.121
..like it, we'll, you know,
go somewhere nicer tomorrow.

51:35.739 --> 51:38.469
This is actually happening!

51:43.213 --> 51:46.205
We're never gonna forget this honeymoon.

52:17.848 --> 52:19.543
Sorry.

52:44.708 --> 52:47.268
We can show those paisanos how it's done.

52:52.082 --> 52:54.778
Cockroach, cockroach, cockroach!

52:54.885 --> 52:57.376
Oh, honey! Honey, honey! l'll get him!

52:59.656 --> 53:02.716
Let's get outta here, please!

53:02.793 --> 53:05.284
- We're checking out!
- l don't wanna touch it!

53:05.395 --> 53:07.260
Get it off me!

53:11.568 --> 53:13.798
Thanks for the help, Daddy.

53:14.938 --> 53:17.930
l miss you.

53:20.077 --> 53:21.942
Honey, he wants to talk to you.

53:22.012 --> 53:26.574
Can't you just tell him thank you from
all of us here at the gorgeous Gianna?

53:35.792 --> 53:37.783
Hello there, Mr McNerney.

53:37.861 --> 53:41.797
Please bear in mind that
our daughter loves him, Dan.

53:41.865 --> 53:48.100
Listen, Leezak, l don't expect
a cracker like you to ever measure up

53:48.171 --> 53:52.005
to anything approaching what l'd consider
a good match for my daughter.

53:52.109 --> 53:53.940
But l'll tell you what l do expect.

53:54.011 --> 53:58.641
l expect you to pay me back in full just as
soon as that silly-ass radio show of yours

53:58.715 --> 54:00.945
yields any kind of reasonable income.

54:01.018 --> 54:03.316
Goodbye, cracker.

54:05.222 --> 54:07.486
Ass-bag!

54:07.558 --> 54:10.220
- What was that?
- He called me a cracker!

54:10.327 --> 54:12.557
A cracker, honey!

54:12.663 --> 54:14.722
He did not.

54:14.831 --> 54:19.131
That surprises you? Your dad hates me.
''Well, wonderful, wonderful.''

54:19.202 --> 54:22.865
He's got your whole family
praying that this marriage fails.

54:22.973 --> 54:25.533
Mom's never said a bad word about you.

54:25.642 --> 54:30.136
Wow, Pussy's never insulted me!
Now l feel loved.

54:30.213 --> 54:32.704
Like your father's neverjudged me?

54:32.816 --> 54:35.910
No, he hasn't. Not once.

54:42.492 --> 54:44.255
Maybe we should just have sex.

54:44.361 --> 54:48.058
Call me crazy, but l'm just
not in the mood to make love.

54:50.367 --> 54:55.168
l'm not, either. But we haven't had sex once
since we've been married,

54:55.238 --> 54:58.435
and there is something
very, very wrong with that.

54:58.542 --> 55:01.568
And l have to tell you... lt's not funny!

55:01.678 --> 55:04.010
l'm sorry.

55:04.081 --> 55:06.413
l'm concerned.

55:06.516 --> 55:12.512
Let's go to sleep. We'll get a good rest,
we'll sightsee tomorrow.

55:12.589 --> 55:14.682
Be fresh in the morning.

55:16.393 --> 55:18.020
Fine.

55:19.630 --> 55:22.030
And then we'll have sex.

56:14.818 --> 56:19.118
lmagine Ernest Hemingway sitting
right over there at the Caffè Florian,

56:19.189 --> 56:23.956
just sipping a single malt,
dreaming up his next masterpiece.

56:27.597 --> 56:29.792
Those birds are psychotic.

56:31.268 --> 56:34.101
History doesn't interest you at all, does it?

56:34.171 --> 56:39.438
Huh? Yeah, it does. l wasn't an art history
major, though, so it's not like...

56:39.509 --> 56:43.104
You don't have to be an art history major
to appreciate art.

56:43.180 --> 56:46.013
- Whoa, whoa.
- What? What?

56:46.116 --> 56:48.277
Do you hear that?

56:48.351 --> 56:52.117
The bells? No? What is it, honey?

56:52.189 --> 56:54.282
What?

56:55.058 --> 56:56.855
What?

56:56.960 --> 56:58.154
What?

56:58.228 --> 57:01.459
What are we listening to?

57:02.833 --> 57:05.324
What? What is it? l can help.

57:05.402 --> 57:08.667
- lt's a message from God. lt's a mes...
- God?

57:10.307 --> 57:12.867
There's a ground ball...

57:12.976 --> 57:14.841
Jackpot!

57:16.747 --> 57:19.477
Honey, we still have to see the Tintorettos.

57:21.485 --> 57:26.718
Oh, the church art is unbelievable,

57:26.823 --> 57:29.383
but it all kinda looks the same to me.

57:31.027 --> 57:33.825
You know l love sports.

57:33.897 --> 57:37.526
l mean, l'm a sports freak.
But how often are we in Europe?

57:37.601 --> 57:40.570
How often are the Dodgers on TV in Europe?

57:43.540 --> 57:48.102
You're right. You go watch sports.
l'll go see the Tintorettos.

57:58.455 --> 58:00.047
- Honey...
- Yeah?

58:00.123 --> 58:05.356
ls this a loving act of generosity,
or am l gonna pay for this later?

58:06.196 --> 58:08.892
Does it make a difference?

58:08.965 --> 58:12.196
l'm gonna make this up to you huge. Huge.

58:12.269 --> 58:16.228
Tonight, everything is your choice.
Dinner in a church, if you want.

58:21.411 --> 58:23.208
- Meet you at the hotel.
- Love you!

58:23.280 --> 58:25.578
l love you.

59:10.360 --> 59:12.419
Peter?

59:12.495 --> 59:15.862
- Peewee? What a surprise!
- What are you doing here?

59:15.966 --> 59:17.331
- ln Venice?
- Yes.

59:17.434 --> 59:23.669
Nextron's buying out Ferrugia Chocolate,
so they sent me in to close the deal.

59:23.773 --> 59:28.335
- Did you get that cognac l sent you?
- Yes. l thought it a tad inappropriate.

59:29.312 --> 59:31.712
l'm sor... l didn't...

59:31.815 --> 59:34.511
l'm just trying to be the gallant loser here.

59:34.618 --> 59:36.779
- Peter...
- Why don't we celebrate?

59:36.853 --> 59:39.048
l'll take you guys to dinner.

59:39.155 --> 59:41.555
l'm on my honeymoon.

59:41.658 --> 59:44.126
- My honeymoon.
- Right, right, right.

59:44.194 --> 59:46.389
See? Yeah.

59:46.496 --> 59:48.964
l can be so thick sometimes. l'm sorry.

59:49.032 --> 59:52.468
l got a lot of work to do anyway,
so l'm going to disappear.

59:52.535 --> 59:54.025
But you guys have fun.

59:54.137 --> 59:55.729
Peter, wait.

59:55.839 --> 59:57.329
l'm...

59:57.407 --> 59:59.875
l don't mean to be rude.

01:00:00.911 --> 01:00:03.004
You couldn't be rude if you tried.

01:00:03.747 --> 01:00:06.841
How's the honeymoon?
lt's good? lt's a dream?

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:08.350
- lt's great.
- Yeah?

01:00:08.418 --> 01:00:11.148
- Oh, yeah, great.
- Where's Tom?

01:00:11.221 --> 01:00:14.679
Oh, he's at the church with...

01:00:16.927 --> 01:00:21.261
He's a huge history buff. Yeah.

01:00:22.933 --> 01:00:28.030
- lt's good you guys share that passion.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:45.111
Fredo, l need to know where
that little signora is at all times.

01:00:45.889 --> 01:00:48.756
Very bold, Mr Prentiss.

01:00:54.898 --> 01:00:57.628
The Dodgers won! The Dodgers won!

01:00:57.734 --> 01:00:59.793
The Dodgers won, honey.

01:01:00.937 --> 01:01:05.965
See? l knew you were gonna make me pay
for watching the game.

01:01:06.076 --> 01:01:09.534
No. No, it's not that.

01:01:10.814 --> 01:01:12.475
We need to talk.

01:01:15.085 --> 01:01:17.315
About what?

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.479
Have you always told me the truth?

01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:23.081
Yeah. Except the time l told you
l liked your brother Willie.

01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:25.923
- This is serious.
- l am serious. l don't like him.

01:01:25.996 --> 01:01:29.227
- Marriage is built on honesty and trust.
- l agree.

01:01:29.299 --> 01:01:32.894
Did you ever do something
that you wanted to tell me about,

01:01:32.969 --> 01:01:35.767
but you couldn't
because you felt bad about it?

01:01:35.839 --> 01:01:38.740
And the more time went on,
the harder it was to tell me,

01:01:38.808 --> 01:01:43.108
and it turned into this big fat lie,
so you kept not telling me about it...

01:01:43.179 --> 01:01:45.739
Did you talk to Kyle?

01:01:45.815 --> 01:01:48.249
- No. Why?
- No reason.

01:01:48.318 --> 01:01:51.082
- Does he know something l should know?
- No.

01:01:51.154 --> 01:01:53.179
- You covered your nose.
- l had an itch.

01:01:53.289 --> 01:01:56.747
You were hiding flared nostrils.
What do you have to tell?

01:02:01.031 --> 01:02:03.499
lt's just

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.000
when Bags died,

01:02:06.102 --> 01:02:11.005
he didn't exactly die
the way that l described it.

01:02:11.107 --> 01:02:15.976
Him chasing the squawking pigeons
off the balcony?

01:02:16.046 --> 01:02:17.946
That.

01:02:18.014 --> 01:02:19.879
What happened?

01:02:19.983 --> 01:02:23.885
Well... OK, l'm reading my magazine,

01:02:23.987 --> 01:02:26.512
and l'm focusing, and l'm really into it.

01:02:26.623 --> 01:02:29.888
And along comes Bags.
He comes trucking over,

01:02:29.993 --> 01:02:34.487
and he starts tugging on my ankle.

01:02:34.564 --> 01:02:37.556
And l was, like, ''Bags, l'm...'' l was like...

01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:41.302
l think l even said ''l'm trying to focus.''

01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:47.071
And he looked up at me and gave me the
''Hey, are you gonna play with me or not?''

01:02:47.177 --> 01:02:51.011
l was, like, ''Yeah, l really just
wanna read, though, Bags.''

01:02:51.081 --> 01:02:54.346
And he started pulling at my ankle again,

01:02:54.417 --> 01:02:58.319
and so l grabbed the ball
and l was, like, ''Go get it, buddy.''

01:02:58.388 --> 01:03:03.655
l threw the ball over my shoulder, it went
out the window, Bags dove, and he died.

01:03:04.727 --> 01:03:06.422
You killed Bags?

01:03:06.529 --> 01:03:10.021
- lt was an accident.
- And you lied about it all this time?

01:03:10.934 --> 01:03:14.870
- Actually, it was more of an omission.
- No, it was more like a lie!

01:03:15.405 --> 01:03:16.997
Where are you going?

01:03:17.073 --> 01:03:20.907
- l have to figure out what to do with this.
- What does that mean?

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:23.740
l can deal with you
being cheap and a shitty driver.

01:03:23.847 --> 01:03:26.839
l cannot deal with you being a liar!

01:03:27.884 --> 01:03:30.717
Wait a second.

01:03:30.787 --> 01:03:34.086
This started with you
wanting to talk about something.

01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:36.784
Well, l don't wanna talk about it right now.

01:03:37.794 --> 01:03:40.092
So you feel guilty about something, too.

01:03:40.196 --> 01:03:44.724
Yes, there is something l ''omitted''
that l don't wanna talk about right now.

01:03:44.801 --> 01:03:47.770
You want a marriage
based on trust and honesty?

01:03:47.871 --> 01:03:50.203
Well, here's your chance! Come on!

01:03:50.273 --> 01:03:53.401
Yeah, yeah, you got it! l can see it! Bring it!

01:03:53.476 --> 01:03:55.967
l slept with Peter Prentiss.

01:04:01.384 --> 01:04:02.408
What?

01:04:02.485 --> 01:04:05.921
- l slept with Peter...
- l heard you.

01:04:05.989 --> 01:04:08.253
- l'm sorry.
- l need to hear everything.

01:04:08.324 --> 01:04:10.656
- No, you don't.
- Yes, l do. That's what l do.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.887
l need to know everything.

01:04:12.962 --> 01:04:16.921
Where you were, what he did,
how small his wiener was. Everything.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.993
- l was helping on an appraisal in Seattle...
- l don't wanna hear it!

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.638
- You slept with that...
- lt was a long time ago.

01:04:26.743 --> 01:04:28.074
- When?
- Before we...

01:04:28.144 --> 01:04:29.270
- Got married?
- Yes!

01:04:29.345 --> 01:04:30.403
- Engaged?
- Of course.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.246
- Got together?
- Yes... No, no.

01:04:34.317 --> 01:04:37.753
lt was right after we met.
My parents were pressuring me to...

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.415
Aha. lmagine my surprise.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.820
l was confused. l'm in Seattle.

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:50.127
He asked me out to dinner.
The champagne is flowing...

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.532
Please, try not to break into song.

01:04:52.969 --> 01:04:58.134
My feelings for you were very, very strong,

01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:00.642
and l needed to know that they were real.

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:04.646
l wasn't brought up to manage
feelings like that very well.

01:05:04.714 --> 01:05:09.014
Yeah. You had a real tough upbringing.

01:05:12.322 --> 01:05:15.382
- l need some air.
- Yeah? Me too.

01:05:15.491 --> 01:05:18.289
Happy now? You broke it.

01:05:18.361 --> 01:05:20.659
By the way, Peter's staying at the hotel.

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.857
That's funny!

01:05:28.671 --> 01:05:30.468
- Hooker!
- Murderer!

01:05:52.161 --> 01:05:55.324
- What's the score?
- 3-2, top of the ninth.

01:05:58.501 --> 01:06:01.334
Are you American?

01:06:01.404 --> 01:06:02.701
Good guess.

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:40.866
Where's Tom?

01:06:40.943 --> 01:06:44.379
We don't feel the need to be
with each other all the time.

01:06:50.153 --> 01:06:54.647
l just find it odd that
you're spending so much time apart

01:06:54.757 --> 01:06:56.816
on your honeymoon.

01:06:59.996 --> 01:07:02.123
Are you OK?

01:07:02.231 --> 01:07:05.894
Peter, just go, please.

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:09.067
Go.

01:07:30.593 --> 01:07:34.154
- Why are you still here?
- l won't leave you here like this.

01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:40.826
Listen, l have a car. l'm having
a quick drink at a friend's house.

01:07:40.937 --> 01:07:44.304
Just take a ride with me.
You know? Catch your breath.

01:07:44.374 --> 01:07:46.467
l'll take you back to Tom.

01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:56.143
- Champagne?
- Sure.

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:10.124
And that's the ball game!

01:08:12.301 --> 01:08:15.065
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, l love this song!

01:08:15.171 --> 01:08:19.198
No, wait, l really shouldn't...
l can't... No, listen.

01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:24.335
Bernardo Salviati can actually
trace his family back to Machiavelli.

01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:39.593
Wow. That's a big house.

01:08:39.694 --> 01:08:43.529
Nextron's thinking of buying it,
turn it into a resort complex.

01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:59.609
Peter, hello.

01:08:59.715 --> 01:09:03.344
Good to see you.
Bernardo, Sarah McNerney.

01:09:06.856 --> 01:09:10.223
Tell me, pretty one,
what brings you to Venice?

01:09:10.292 --> 01:09:12.352
l'm on my honeymoon.

01:09:12.428 --> 01:09:13.895
- Your honeymoon?
- Yeah.

01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:18.059
- She's so young to be married.
- Why does everyone keep on saying that?

01:09:18.701 --> 01:09:20.134
Where is your husband?

01:09:20.236 --> 01:09:25.799
l'm going to meet up with him,
you know, later.

01:09:28.578 --> 01:09:33.606
l was married for 27 years
before my wife passed away.

01:09:33.716 --> 01:09:38.210
Believe me, the first months
are the most difficult.

01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:45.488
Bernardo here's a little bit of a romantic.

01:09:47.964 --> 01:09:50.057
l love that.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.495
Let's have a drink.

01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:54.566
Please.

01:09:54.637 --> 01:09:58.403
You're on the radio? That's awesome!

01:09:59.976 --> 01:10:06.006
So, when are we gonna go back to do the...?

01:10:06.449 --> 01:10:09.612
Whoa, yeah. l can't do that.

01:10:09.685 --> 01:10:14.782
Don't tell me all the cute conversation
and air-humping is leading nowhere.

01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:23.859
You mean when are we gonna...?

01:10:26.435 --> 01:10:32.465
All right, so l'm gonna go and hit the...
and then we'll do that thing.

01:10:32.575 --> 01:10:35.135
- Cool.
- OK.

01:10:35.244 --> 01:10:37.303
l'll be waiting!

01:10:56.432 --> 01:10:59.162
And the hits just keep on comin'.

01:11:11.147 --> 01:11:13.945
Can l get the key to 309, please?

01:11:14.016 --> 01:11:17.008
And do you know
if my wife's up in the room?

01:11:17.119 --> 01:11:20.282
A good husband knows
where his wife is at all time.

01:11:21.791 --> 01:11:25.955
And a good maitre d'
answers questions when he's asked.

01:11:32.168 --> 01:11:34.568
Look, l'm not gonna pay you for an answer.

01:11:35.638 --> 01:11:38.038
ln this case, you should.

01:11:48.150 --> 01:11:52.644
Your wife is in a car on her way
to Salviati's, with Mr Prentiss.

01:11:53.356 --> 01:11:55.415
Mr Peter Prentiss?

01:11:58.427 --> 01:12:01.419
Of course. What's Salviati's?

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:04.897
One of the oldest
and most beautiful estates in Venice.

01:12:05.001 --> 01:12:09.233
- Maybe Mr Peter will buy it.
- Of course Mr Peter will buy it.

01:12:09.338 --> 01:12:12.000
All right, where is this place?

01:12:16.746 --> 01:12:19.681
You can't go. You will be shot on sight.

01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:22.013
OK. That's...

01:12:25.021 --> 01:12:29.583
- When are they coming back?
- They are out for the evening.

01:12:29.692 --> 01:12:31.626
You know what?

01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:36.960
l'm not gonna be waiting here
for her when she gets back.

01:12:37.066 --> 01:12:38.863
Oh, no!

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:50.435
l wanna say that word!

01:12:55.217 --> 01:12:59.119
Sarah,
maybe we should switch to water, huh?

01:13:03.392 --> 01:13:05.724
l think we should go find Tom now.

01:13:12.134 --> 01:13:15.160
That was the longest freakin' piss
in ltalian history.

01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:17.102
Hey, Wendy.

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.275
l couldn't find you in the crowd.

01:13:23.279 --> 01:13:25.770
That's cool. You ready to go?

01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:30.010
Yeah. Listen...

01:13:30.119 --> 01:13:34.488
Why don't l just walk you back
to your hotel and drop you off?

01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:36.649
That sounds like a plan.

01:13:36.759 --> 01:13:39.421
OK. What hotel are you staying at?

01:13:39.495 --> 01:13:41.588
What hotel are you staying at?

01:13:42.765 --> 01:13:44.824
The Gianna.

01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:47.198
Oh, my God! Me too!

01:14:05.988 --> 01:14:09.788
Oh, my God. This is like a Twilight Zone.

01:14:09.859 --> 01:14:11.952
l couldn't agree with you more.

01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:27.039
We're here.

01:14:28.911 --> 01:14:32.574
Damn, l don't have my key.
Can l use your phone?

01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:34.376
My phone?

01:14:34.483 --> 01:14:37.316
Yeah, to call downstairs. For my key.

01:14:47.696 --> 01:14:51.496
Oh, slow down there.
l think you got the wrong room.

01:14:55.938 --> 01:14:57.530
Oh, my!

01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:00.499
Oh, God.

01:15:00.576 --> 01:15:03.443
lnsult me, radio man!

01:15:05.281 --> 01:15:07.613
l'm on my honeymoon.

01:15:14.056 --> 01:15:16.115
- l'm telling you...
- You pig!

01:15:37.379 --> 01:15:39.142
Thank you.

01:15:46.322 --> 01:15:48.620
What? What?

01:15:48.724 --> 01:15:50.589
- What?
- l can't take this any more.

01:15:54.396 --> 01:15:56.455
l'm on my honeymoon!

01:16:00.236 --> 01:16:03.728
Calm down. You were just doing
the same thing with Wendy.

01:16:03.806 --> 01:16:06.104
You have no right to be angry.

01:16:06.175 --> 01:16:08.769
- You slut!
- Excuse me?

01:16:08.844 --> 01:16:12.336
You had your tongue down his throat.
l saw it out the window!

01:16:13.082 --> 01:16:14.811
Did you see me slap him, then?

01:16:14.917 --> 01:16:17.010
Don't give me that.

01:16:17.119 --> 01:16:20.486
Some part of you wants him! Just say it!

01:16:20.589 --> 01:16:25.083
Fine. l'm not gonna lie any more.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.288
Certain things would be easier,
given his background.

01:16:28.364 --> 01:16:32.824
And a small part of me thought that
l wanted that once. A very small part.

01:16:36.872 --> 01:16:40.467
Why would you invite him
on our honeymoon?

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:44.444
l didn't invite him.
l don't know how he found us.

01:16:44.513 --> 01:16:47.141
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe it was magic.

01:16:47.216 --> 01:16:50.447
No, Peter must be a warlock.

01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:56.657
That's yours.

01:16:56.725 --> 01:17:00.957
Yeah, sure. lt matches perfect
with my red leather panties!

01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:07.165
OK, l met a woman at a bar.
Nothing happened.

01:17:07.236 --> 01:17:11.673
You picked up a total stranger at a bar,
brought her back to our honeymoon suite,

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.833
and took off her disgusting red bra?

01:17:13.909 --> 01:17:15.570
Nothing happened, l swear.

01:17:15.678 --> 01:17:19.341
No, the brajustjumped off
her bare naked breasts.

01:17:20.816 --> 01:17:26.049
You sit there and make me feel guilty
for a kiss, a kiss that l didn't even want!

01:17:26.155 --> 01:17:28.851
Don't tell me you didn't want it!

01:17:29.692 --> 01:17:33.992
You wanted it! l could see from
the balcony that you wanted it!

01:17:36.265 --> 01:17:38.529
l'm sorry. Oh, my God.

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.727
Son of a biatch!

01:17:40.836 --> 01:17:43.532
- My skull is on fire!
- Oh, oh, oh, OK...

01:17:44.873 --> 01:17:47.034
- Who is it?
- Room service.

01:17:47.443 --> 01:17:49.741
Just... You just...

01:17:53.582 --> 01:17:55.675
- No, go away!
- Listen, l'm leaving.

01:17:55.751 --> 01:17:58.379
Last chance. Come with me to Seattle.

01:17:58.454 --> 01:18:01.890
Hello, Peter. So glad you could join us.

01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:06.186
Welcome to the honeymoon from hell,
shitheel!

01:18:06.261 --> 01:18:07.592
What are you doing, Tom?

01:18:07.696 --> 01:18:11.359
l think it's time for Peter and l to tangle.

01:18:11.433 --> 01:18:14.869
- See? You have no future with this lunatic!
- Shut up!

01:18:14.937 --> 01:18:16.598
Tom, you're acting crazy!

01:18:16.705 --> 01:18:21.608
Maybe it's cos l just got hit in the head
with a ten-pound ashtray!

01:18:22.144 --> 01:18:27.047
l gotta warn you, Leezak. l studied
karate with a Chinese grandmaster.

01:18:27.116 --> 01:18:31.780
Yeah? Well, l hope he showed you
how to pull a fire poker out of your ass!

01:18:31.887 --> 01:18:33.946
Tom, put the poker down.

01:18:37.826 --> 01:18:40.727
Fredo, call the police!

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.125
Move, move, move!

01:18:50.172 --> 01:18:53.073
You sat at our wedding!

01:18:53.142 --> 01:18:55.906
You heard us take our vows.

01:18:55.978 --> 01:19:01.314
And you still had the nerve
to show up on our honeymoon

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:04.079
and try to have sex with my wife!

01:19:10.192 --> 01:19:11.454
Run, you coward!

01:19:11.527 --> 01:19:13.620
You stay away from my wife!

01:19:16.265 --> 01:19:17.789
l didn't...

01:19:17.866 --> 01:19:20.198
Please, stop! That's my husband!

01:19:31.346 --> 01:19:33.780
- Maybe they were right.
- Who?

01:19:36.318 --> 01:19:40.880
Everyone. They said that
we were too young,

01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:45.023
and that we needed to get
to know each other better.

01:19:47.529 --> 01:19:49.690
Maybe they were right.

01:19:50.899 --> 01:19:52.696
Maybe love isn't enough.

01:19:59.842 --> 01:20:00.968
What did he say?

01:20:01.043 --> 01:20:03.307
Peterjust bailed us out.

01:20:05.247 --> 01:20:07.647
Well, that's justjim-dandy.

01:20:09.251 --> 01:20:11.219
Forget it.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.481
- l'm going home.
- Yeah, me too!

01:20:16.992 --> 01:20:19.358
Passports, please.

01:20:19.428 --> 01:20:23.922
Are you leaving with any fruit,
vegetables or currency in excess of $10,000?

01:20:24.032 --> 01:20:29.197
No. No, but my husband does have
two pounds of hash hidden in his rectum.

01:20:40.782 --> 01:20:46.846
The first sex l had on my honeymoon
was with a man named Santino.

01:20:48.056 --> 01:20:49.956
And you're laughing?

01:20:51.527 --> 01:20:54.690
Excuse me, stewardess. Can l...?

01:20:57.566 --> 01:21:02.936
Can l get one of those doughnut pillows?

01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:05.631
Yeah, right away.

01:21:08.277 --> 01:21:10.802
Sweet girl.

01:21:13.549 --> 01:21:15.779
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.230
l feel like we've been married for 50 years.

01:21:34.303 --> 01:21:36.430
Oh, you should be so lucky.

01:21:39.441 --> 01:21:44.401
- Tell me how Peter ended up in our hotel.
- Tell me what happened with Red Bra.

01:21:45.314 --> 01:21:48.078
What? What? What are you looking at?

01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:52.143
- l hope you used a rubber.
- No, l didn't! lt didn't get that far.

01:21:52.254 --> 01:21:54.984
- l hope Peter used one.
- They don't sell condoms that big.

01:21:57.526 --> 01:22:00.927
That's funny. You hear that?
We got a comedian on the plane.

01:22:00.996 --> 01:22:03.487
- You want me to make you laugh?
- Yeah.

01:22:03.599 --> 01:22:06.261
l'm moving out when l get home.
How funny is that?

01:22:06.335 --> 01:22:08.803
- Great!
- The second we get home.

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:10.701
- l'm done talking now.
- Me too.

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:16.173
And that was it. Game over.

01:22:28.624 --> 01:22:30.990
- What's up?
- She came to the apartment.

01:22:31.059 --> 01:22:33.118
- ls she there now?
- No, she left.

01:22:33.829 --> 01:22:36.627
- Did she say anything?
- She took all her stuff.

01:22:37.399 --> 01:22:39.492
That can't be good.

01:22:40.802 --> 01:22:43.066
And she left you this.

01:22:43.472 --> 01:22:45.030
What's that?

01:22:49.845 --> 01:22:51.312
Beer?

01:22:52.014 --> 01:22:58.180
Come on, man. You're getting divorced.
Breakfast beer is a must.

01:23:00.222 --> 01:23:03.350
- l need to talk to my dad. Give me a lift?
- Sure.

01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:10.490
Gonna tell me what you're chewing on?

01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:15.092
l just don't know if love is enough any more.

01:23:15.203 --> 01:23:18.070
What do you mean, ''enough''?

01:23:18.173 --> 01:23:23.042
l mean, even if Sarah and l do love each other,

01:23:24.279 --> 01:23:27.612
maybe we did need more time
to get to know each other.

01:23:31.019 --> 01:23:36.184
So, what you're saying here is

01:23:36.258 --> 01:23:41.025
you had a couple of bad days in Europe,
and it's over.

01:23:43.198 --> 01:23:45.291
Time to grow up, Tommy.

01:23:47.035 --> 01:23:51.699
Some days your mother and me loved each
other. Other days we had to work at it.

01:23:52.741 --> 01:23:55.733
You never see the hard days
in a photo album.

01:23:56.445 --> 01:24:01.109
But those are the ones that get you
from one happy snapshot to the next.

01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:08.955
l'm sorry your honeymoon stunk, but that's
what you got dealt. Now work through it.

01:24:10.459 --> 01:24:15.294
Sarah doesn't need a guy with
a fat wallet to make her happy.

01:24:15.397 --> 01:24:20.664
l saw how you love this girl.
How you two lit each other up.

01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:25.740
She doesn't need any more security than that.

01:24:30.846 --> 01:24:32.177
Thanks, Dad.

01:24:33.582 --> 01:24:35.641
ls it over?

01:24:37.486 --> 01:24:39.579
Not even close.

01:24:46.027 --> 01:24:49.428
What you do here, Tom Leezak?
You no allowed here no more.

01:24:49.498 --> 01:24:51.295
Open the gates, jack-in-the-box.

01:24:51.366 --> 01:24:55.132
Me no jack-in-box! You jack-in-box!
Go away now!

01:24:55.203 --> 01:24:57.865
Don't make me break my foot off in your ass.

01:24:57.973 --> 01:25:00.498
Look, Yuan, l just need to talk to her.

01:25:00.609 --> 01:25:03.601
Relationship over. She no like you any more.

01:25:03.678 --> 01:25:06.613
- Open the goddamn gate!
- Shut up, Kyle!

01:25:06.681 --> 01:25:09.809
Look, Yuan, did she actually
say those words to you?

01:25:09.885 --> 01:25:13.321
She say you have kiki with bimbo.
Same thing.

01:25:14.623 --> 01:25:17.023
We are not leaving this intercom.

01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:21.528
until Sarah herself confirms
that she is shitcanning Tom!

01:25:22.798 --> 01:25:23.856
We're not.

01:25:23.965 --> 01:25:29.460
All right, that is damn straight!
This is my wife! Now open up the gate!

01:25:29.538 --> 01:25:31.836
Can't we give the guy a chance to explain?

01:25:31.907 --> 01:25:33.966
Don't even think about it, Dickie.

01:25:34.543 --> 01:25:38.206
Either you're gonna open the gate,
or l'm gonna open the gate.

01:25:38.313 --> 01:25:39.837
Either way, l'm coming in!

01:25:40.749 --> 01:25:45.482
- We'll sic the hounds on you, Leezak!
- Bring 'em on, Willie!

01:25:58.033 --> 01:25:59.057
What's going on?

01:25:59.167 --> 01:26:02.659
You leave me no choice!
l'm gonna have to ram the gate!

01:26:02.737 --> 01:26:04.898
l am so down with that!

01:26:07.609 --> 01:26:09.509
- What we do now?
- Call the cops.

01:26:11.179 --> 01:26:13.238
We call SWAT team on your ass!

01:26:13.682 --> 01:26:19.712
l'm ramming the gate! l don't know if you're
hearing, but l am going to ram your gate!

01:26:20.856 --> 01:26:24.690
- What is the commotion in here?
- Tom ram gate.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.363
What the hell is this?

01:26:33.768 --> 01:26:36.066
lt's go time.

01:26:53.788 --> 01:26:55.551
That is one strong gate.

01:26:59.628 --> 01:27:00.652
Tom?

01:27:15.477 --> 01:27:21.347
Look, Yuan, Willie,
whoever else is listening...

01:27:21.449 --> 01:27:26.318
You don't want me to be with Sarah,
and l can't change that.

01:27:26.421 --> 01:27:32.360
l don't know where we're gonna be
in ten, 20, 40 years.

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.451
l don't know who we're gonna be.

01:27:34.529 --> 01:27:38.522
l don't know if l'm ever gonna
be able to give her all of this.

01:27:39.668 --> 01:27:43.798
There are a million things that l don't know.

01:27:44.439 --> 01:27:47.272
But there's one thing that l do.

01:27:47.342 --> 01:27:50.334
And that's that l love Sarah.

01:27:50.445 --> 01:27:54.973
And l am going to love her
day in and day out

01:27:55.050 --> 01:27:57.348
for the rest of my life.

01:27:59.454 --> 01:28:01.718
Now, will you please,

01:28:02.824 --> 01:28:04.883
please,

01:28:06.294 --> 01:28:10.355
open the gate so l can tell that to my wife.

01:28:34.889 --> 01:28:37.380
l'm sorry, man.

01:28:38.093 --> 01:28:42.689
Sometimes when it's over, it's just over.

01:29:04.386 --> 01:29:08.083
Drop the love bomb, baby! Yeah!

01:29:13.962 --> 01:29:15.759
Now do you get it?

01:29:18.366 --> 01:29:20.596
l love him, Daddy.

01:29:21.936 --> 01:29:24.063
Then go get him.

01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:02.171
- l'm sorry.
- Me too.

01:30:03.912 --> 01:30:06.437
l miss you.

01:30:06.514 --> 01:30:09.005
l miss you, too.

01:30:09.651 --> 01:30:13.018
l miss wrecking airplane bathrooms
with you.

01:30:13.121 --> 01:30:15.681
l miss sleeping with you inside a snowball.

01:30:17.625 --> 01:30:20.685
And torching hotels in Europe.

01:30:22.664 --> 01:30:26.760
l miss doing time in prison with you.

01:30:37.212 --> 01:30:40.147
- Do you wanna try to....?
- Definitely.

01:34:37.385 --> 01:34:40.912
