WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:18.393
What?

00:18.477 --> 00:21.355
- I said, "Are you all right?"
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:22.272 --> 00:26.235
Maybe you should talk to your sister.
It's an important decision.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.153
- My sister?
- Yes.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.448
- Mark?
- Yeah.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.450
Are you sure you're okay?

00:34.243 --> 00:37.704
Yes. I'm sorry, I just--
I got a little woozy and then--

00:39.039 --> 00:40.749
I'm gonna stop by the bathroom.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.586
Uh-uh. I think it's the other way.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.509
Right.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.516
I don't know if I hate senators
or congressmen more.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.978
How many of those have you had?

01:43.061 --> 01:44.605
Just this one.

01:44.688 --> 01:48.025
Good. We need you nimble.
We gotta get down there. You're on in 20.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.987
I was on with the Board earlier.
They're really grateful for this.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.157
- Gabby.
- Natalie, hello.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.783
Hi.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.746
Gabby,
this is Helena Eagan.

02:01.914 --> 02:06.001
My gosh.
Helena, so good to finally meet you.

02:08.544 --> 02:09.545
Likewise.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.130
This better be working, assholes.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.651
Where am I?

04:36.818 --> 04:39.321
Where am I?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.788
Mark. You okay, milady?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.000
So Rebeck smells weird.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.253
Rebeck smells weird?

04:54.336 --> 04:57.297
Yeah, she was making chewing noises,
but she was not chewing.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.384
Just be prepared 'cause you might have to
share a book with her.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.927
A book, right.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.012
The one you forgot to bring
even though I did remind you.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.557
Right. Yeah, I'm sure-- Sorry.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.433
That's okay.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.518
Okay.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.729
Okay.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.022
How's our baby?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.986
Our-- I'm gonna assume you mean that
in the "it takes a village" sense.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.571
And she's good. She's hungry.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.158
I wanna have the life change talk.
I just need to pump before I die.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.369
- I'll be really fast. Okay.
- Okay.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.958
Hey. Hi. Hi.

06:26.637 --> 06:27.721
"Radar."

06:28.263 --> 06:30.307
What's the thesis?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.643
I agree. It's very confused.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.144
Mark, hello.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.731
Hey, guys. What's up?

06:37.814 --> 06:38.941
- Patton, no.
- Mark,

06:39.024 --> 06:41.610
we were just discussing whether
it might have been a wiser move

06:41.693 --> 06:45.322
for your sister to put off introducing
the child until after tonight's event.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.199
Mark, you don't have to weigh in on that.

06:47.282 --> 06:51.161
- Obviously the child is an absolute angel.
- Wait-- That's my sister? With the baby?

06:51.245 --> 06:53.205
Exactly, it's his sister.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.873
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.002
Well, that was awkward.

07:00.254 --> 07:05.133
Okay, so my sister has the baby.
And Cobel is here?

07:08.262 --> 07:10.264
I've been asked to share my book with you.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.100
So I've heard. Rebecca?

07:13.183 --> 07:16.687
Rebeck. I have small eyes,
so I have to read pretty close.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.771
Okay. Well, I'm--

07:17.855 --> 07:19.857
I'm sure that'll be fine.
If you'll excuse me?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.401
And I have some sores
on the back of my head from my bird.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.735
- You might see them.
- Okay.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.154
Hey.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.490
Hello, Mark.

07:29.408 --> 07:33.579
I pumped, so it's Miller time.
Okay, so life change. What's happening?

07:36.206 --> 07:39.209
We're, this is gonna sound weird…

07:41.670 --> 07:43.088
We're close, you and I?

07:44.006 --> 07:46.425
What do you-- What's going on?

07:47.593 --> 07:48.677
Can we talk privately?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.597
- I just have to--
- Okay, my dearest ones,

07:51.680 --> 07:52.848
we are nearing that hour,

07:52.931 --> 07:55.350
so if you'd all peacefully waft
in the living room…

07:55.434 --> 07:57.227
Okay. Let's talk
at the first reflection break.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.312
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.222
<i>You just don't realize
how much kids are gonna change your life.</i>

08:34.306 --> 08:35.557
But they do.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.352
- How many kids do you have?
- Just gave birth to my third.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.270
I should've stopped at two.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.398
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.734
- Angelo, great to see you.
- You too.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.238
Helena, this is my husband, Angelo Arteta.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.490
Helena, nice to meet you.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.741
I've gotta hop backstage.

08:52.824 --> 08:53.951
- I'll see you in a second.
- Okay.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.536
Lovely to see you, Natalie.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.498
- You okay?
- She couldn't find the bottle.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.459
Wow. Three kids.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.545
Couldn't have done it
without a little help.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.966
I mean, the idea that
people would want to outlaw severance.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.344
I know.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.116
The photo display is very moving.

09:34.199 --> 09:38.161
I already knew how I'd be voting,
but I think--

09:38.245 --> 09:42.124
Well, seeing that and seeing you
and hearing what you have to say,

09:42.666 --> 09:44.459
all of this could really
make a difference.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.462
I hope so.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.882
Let's change some minds.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.801
Well, I'm certainly gonna try.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.803
Thank you.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.682
And please
thank your father if you see him.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.270
I will.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.117
Mark. Come here.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.204
Saved us a seat.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.127
I just have to find my glasses.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.464
Mark, can you just hold that

10:30.547 --> 10:31.465
- for a second?
- Yeah.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.350
Oh, my God.

10:43.936 --> 10:46.396
Sorry, you can't unring

10:46.480 --> 10:50.651
the bell-ringing app apparently.

10:52.110 --> 10:55.280
Okay.
Thank you all for being here.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.200
Before we start, there is one person

10:58.283 --> 11:00.994
that I would like to thank
first and foremost.

11:01.078 --> 11:05.958
Family is both my bedrock
and my inspiration.

11:06.041 --> 11:10.546
So I dedicate the reading
to my firstborn daughter,

11:10.629 --> 11:11.713
who is here tonight.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.091
Eleanor, I love you.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.724
My brother-in-law.

11:22.808 --> 11:26.144
And with that… I begin.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.859
"It's said that as a child,

11:31.942 --> 11:36.864
Wolfgang Mozart killed another boy
by slamming his head in a piano.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.575
Don't worry.

11:39.658 --> 11:42.619
My research for this book
has proven the claim untrue.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.622
As your heart rate settles though,

11:45.706 --> 11:48.125
- consider the power an author…"
- Mark.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.836
Can I look at her book too?

11:50.919 --> 11:51.962
I can crane.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.047
- "…can hold over a reader…"
- Sure.

11:54.131 --> 11:57.301
"…heretofore called 'you.'

11:58.594 --> 12:02.806
But what, indeed, is 'you'?"

12:02.890 --> 12:03.891
<i>Good luck tonight.</i>

12:03.974 --> 12:05.601
It was great to meet you, Helena.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.021
<i>"How can 'you'
mean different things</i>

12:09.104 --> 12:12.024
<i>to millions of readers
around a vast Earth?</i>

12:13.525 --> 12:18.488
<i>And perhaps, most importantly,
who are you?"</i>

13:50.747 --> 13:52.875
<i>"All creatures,
from the leaping cat</i>

13:52.958 --> 13:54.543
<i>to the cowering shrew,</i>

13:54.626 --> 14:00.382
think of themselves as 'you,'
a logical center for the universe.

14:00.465 --> 14:04.845
Yet the cat eats the shrew,
and we, like Schrödinger,

14:04.928 --> 14:07.890
live on to wonder what it means."

14:08.891 --> 14:09.933
End of chapter.

14:14.313 --> 14:16.064
Let's all take a

14:16.148 --> 14:19.359
seven-minute reflection break
and then come back.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.197
Balf. Prepare the neti pot.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.698
It was transformative.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.326
I'm gonna have to change my name again.

14:27.409 --> 14:31.413
What a wordsmith. He seemed to have
a little something in his throat.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.123
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.791
I'm gonna see if she'll have more bottle.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.627
Give me a couple of minutes,
then meet me in the baby room?

14:36.710 --> 14:37.711
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.300
Excuse me.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.646
Mr. Hale-- Ricken?

14:56.980 --> 14:59.233
I don't know why
my voice shakes like that.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.486
I sound like a sad old hamburger waiter

15:03.403 --> 15:05.239
prattling on about sauces.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.616
"Hamburger waiter." What the fuck is that?

15:07.699 --> 15:10.327
Jesus, why do I ever
open my buffoon mouth?

15:10.410 --> 15:11.328
It's going great.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.498
- I mean, the book is brilliant, and--
- Okay, Mark.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.083
Thank you, but you don't have to say that.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.001
I'm well aware of
how I come across to you.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.295
What? No, I mean it.

15:20.379 --> 15:23.423
The-- Your book, it--
it opened up the world for me.

15:25.509 --> 15:26.844
Mark, are you okay?

15:26.927 --> 15:30.931
Yes. This book changed my whole life.

15:31.890 --> 15:33.475
You actually read it?

15:33.559 --> 15:35.978
Ricken, are we friends?

15:38.272 --> 15:40.566
Look, I know I sometimes
make you feel "less than"

15:40.649 --> 15:42.901
for having had the procedure.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.111
And I regret that.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.865
You had to deal with Gemma's passing
in a way that was best for you.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.786
You know, I was scrolling through
old pictures this morning,

15:52.870 --> 15:56.707
and I found one of the four of us
on the crest hike.

15:56.790 --> 16:00.586
- You remember the funny bees?
- Do you have that on you? The picture?

16:00.669 --> 16:04.006
Yeah, sure. I should.

16:04.089 --> 16:07.593
- Ricken. The neti pot is warm.
- Thank you, Balf.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.761
Mark, I need to flush my sinuses.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.973
But thank you. You have no idea
how much this has meant to me.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.028
Mark, I was worried about you.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.613
I'm fine. Thanks.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.865
I'm just going to check on my sister.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.204
When you hugged me before,
you suddenly became tense. What was that?

16:37.206 --> 16:38.248
I didn't know I did.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.043
Well, you did. You're tense now.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.254
Yeah, sorry, it's just parties.

16:44.338 --> 16:46.840
Did you mean what you said before?

16:47.799 --> 16:49.051
About your plans.

16:51.303 --> 16:52.304
Of course.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.057
Tell me more.

16:59.269 --> 17:02.439
You know, I'm so sorry. I'm just--
I'm on uncle duty for my sister.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.066
So I'll be right back.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.651
- Okay?
- Okay.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.028
Okay. Thanks, Ms. Cobel.

17:57.369 --> 18:00.372
- I know. Hey, there you are.
- Hey, I really need to talk to you.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.708
No, I know. I just have to deal with her.
She's having a meltdown.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.084
But just meet me in there, okay?

18:04.168 --> 18:07.171
- Okay, I'll just-- Wait. Okay.
- I promise I'll be back.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.013
Thank God, Mrs. Selvig. Hi.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.098
Can you take her for a sec
while I talk to Mark?

18:18.182 --> 18:20.225
- Of course, love.
- Thank you.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.060
- Is Mark all right?
- Yeah, he's fine.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.395
Thank you, you're an angel.

18:35.199 --> 18:38.368
Okay… I'm all yours.

18:50.923 --> 18:53.467
<i>My name is Helena,
and I'm an Eagan.</i>

18:55.177 --> 18:57.221
<i>So one of the things you learn
growing up as an Eagan</i>

18:57.304 --> 18:59.348
<i>is that the workers are our family.</i>

18:59.431 --> 19:01.350
<i>And I remember being confused
about that as a kid,</i>

19:01.433 --> 19:02.434
<i>because I thought that meant</i>

19:02.518 --> 19:04.937
<i>I had a few hundred thousand
literal brothers and sisters</i>

19:05.020 --> 19:07.356
<i>scattered around the world.</i>

19:07.439 --> 19:08.565
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

19:09.233 --> 19:12.402
<i>But as I grew older,
I learned that it's about shared ideals.</i>

19:13.820 --> 19:16.573
<i>My dad used to make me
recite the nine core principles</i>

19:16.657 --> 19:17.824
<i>before bed every night,</i>

19:17.908 --> 19:20.744
<i>which I can't say I always did happily.
Sorry, Dad.</i>

19:20.827 --> 19:24.957
<i>But those are now the values that I share
with everyone who works at Lumon,</i>

19:25.040 --> 19:27.292
<i>and that's what makes them my family.</i>

19:27.918 --> 19:30.379
<i>And I would never ever ask them
to do anything</i>

19:30.462 --> 19:33.382
<i>that I'm not willing
or excited to do myself.</i>

19:33.465 --> 19:36.677
<i>Look, my dad would love for me to sit here</i>

19:36.760 --> 19:39.263
<i>and say that I'm taking
this job out of loyalty</i>

19:39.346 --> 19:44.017
<i>and that it was the spirit of pure Eagan
calling me to service.</i>

19:44.726 --> 19:49.690
<i>But I took a severed job because
it sounds freaking awesome.</i>

19:50.482 --> 19:52.860
<i>So, no,
I don't think severance divides us.</i>

19:53.694 --> 19:55.195
<i>I think it brings us together.</i>

20:14.464 --> 20:15.465
<i>Greetings.</i>

20:15.549 --> 20:18.552
- <i>I'm not here right now.</i>
- Goddamn it, Milchick!

22:11.039 --> 22:12.040
Helena.

22:12.708 --> 22:13.917
She's in here, sir.

22:24.178 --> 22:25.179
Helena.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.725
You look so nice.

22:32.603 --> 22:33.645
Like a film.

22:36.565 --> 22:37.566
Thank you.

22:41.445 --> 22:42.446
Are you…

22:44.323 --> 22:46.325
Are you still in pain?

22:48.744 --> 22:49.745
I'm not.

22:50.954 --> 22:51.955
Not anymore.

22:58.712 --> 23:02.132
I cried in my bed when they told me
what she tried to do to you.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.844
What that innie tried to do. I--

23:09.723 --> 23:11.558
Thank you for going through with this.

23:13.143 --> 23:15.479
The Grandfather would cherish
what you've done.

23:17.397 --> 23:21.443
And one day you will sit with me
at my revolving.

23:25.113 --> 23:26.323
Are you feeling well?

23:27.824 --> 23:28.825
Yeah.

23:29.326 --> 23:33.747
I think, I think
the drink just hit me a little bit.

23:35.499 --> 23:37.334
You'll be all right for the speech?

23:39.378 --> 23:41.505
For my speech. Yeah. Of course.

23:44.925 --> 23:48.095
Do you remember when I brought home
the first chip to show you?

23:50.556 --> 23:51.640
The prototype.

23:53.851 --> 23:56.186
It had the blue and green lights
back then.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.064
Yeah.

24:00.816 --> 24:04.903
I remember you said to me,
"It's so pretty, Daddy.

24:06.655 --> 24:09.199
Everybody in the whole world
should get one."

24:11.660 --> 24:12.703
They will.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.540
Because of you.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.004
They'll all be Kier's children.

24:25.507 --> 24:29.011
Mr. Eagan. Helena.
It's time to head to stage.

24:54.036 --> 24:58.415
Forgive me
for the harm I've caused this world.

25:00.375 --> 25:05.756
None may atone for my actions… but me.

25:09.176 --> 25:13.305
And only in me shall their stain live on.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.852
All I can be is sorry.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.231
And that is all I am.

27:06.502 --> 27:08.253
<i>You swear
you're not fucking with me?</i>

27:09.004 --> 27:10.005
I swear.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.008
This is so insane.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.928
They need to send people down
to check every inch of that place.

27:16.011 --> 27:19.515
Like, inspectors or whatever.
Is that a thing? Inspectors?

27:19.598 --> 27:21.141
Yeah. There are inspectors.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.852
Mark has b-- I mean, out here,

27:23.936 --> 27:27.523
you have been trying to figure out
what Lumon does. What you do.

27:27.606 --> 27:28.607
Okay.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.569
I just…

27:34.613 --> 27:36.698
I just want to know why.

27:38.325 --> 27:40.327
Why he put me in there.

27:45.958 --> 27:47.084
He lost his wife.

27:47.751 --> 27:51.171
You lost your wife.
A little before you started at Lumon.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.966
Gemma.

27:55.467 --> 28:00.305
It was a car accident, and,
at first, you tried to keep teaching.

28:01.682 --> 28:02.975
I was a teacher?

28:03.058 --> 28:05.477
A professor. Of history.

28:06.562 --> 28:09.398
You tried to go back
to teaching three weeks after she died,

28:09.898 --> 28:12.568
and it was a disaster.

28:14.027 --> 28:16.864
She was just still in your veins,
you know?

28:17.406 --> 28:18.532
Making everything hurt.

28:20.617 --> 28:24.162
Which is why I guess you thought
the severed job would--

28:26.957 --> 28:28.959
He hoped you'd be spared from the pain.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.636
It's a nice name. Gemma.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.474
Yeah.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.770
We were all really close. It was great.

28:50.564 --> 28:51.857
She was wonderful.

28:53.358 --> 28:54.568
She made you wonderful.

29:43.033 --> 29:44.660
They told me not to talk to you.

29:44.743 --> 29:49.331
The goddamn OTC's been triggered!
Mark S. is his fucking innie!

29:49.414 --> 29:50.541
What? That's not possible.

29:52.501 --> 29:55.003
It's Dylan.
They've been plotting this all along.

29:55.087 --> 29:56.296
Helly's at the gala.

29:56.380 --> 30:00.217
I'll take care of Helly.
I'll fix it like I fix everything.

30:01.009 --> 30:04.638
Get to the security office,
and shut it off now!

30:04.721 --> 30:06.139
Shit!

30:25.367 --> 30:27.244
Goddamn it! Dylan!

30:27.744 --> 30:28.620
Dylan!

30:29.663 --> 30:31.665
I know you're in there, Dylan.
Open the door!

30:31.748 --> 30:33.834
Fuck you, Mr. Milchick!

30:34.543 --> 30:37.004
Dylan! Dylan!

30:38.964 --> 30:40.883
Ricken knows a lot of high-end journalists
in New York.

30:40.966 --> 30:43.051
And you think that's better
than the police?

30:43.135 --> 30:45.679
Well, Lumon has their hands
in so many pies.

30:45.762 --> 30:47.347
Sorry, do you understand metaphor?

30:47.431 --> 30:49.183
Yeah, hands in pies. I get it.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.560
I think we have to be really careful
about who we talk to.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.437
- Okay.
- How much time do you have?

30:53.520 --> 30:55.189
I don't know. Maybe an hour?

30:55.272 --> 30:57.441
Right. Because once your bosses find out…

30:57.524 --> 31:01.361
Jesus, I totally forgot. Cobel!
Why is Cobel here?

31:01.445 --> 31:02.654
What?

31:02.738 --> 31:05.490
My boss from Lumon. Ms. Cobel.
She's at this party.

31:05.574 --> 31:06.700
What are you talking about?

31:06.783 --> 31:08.744
I mean, she's dressed different.

31:08.827 --> 31:11.830
Kind of a flowy, purple outfit,
silver hair.

31:13.207 --> 31:15.042
Mark, are you talking about Mrs. Selvig?

31:15.542 --> 31:17.878
Maybe, but her name is Harmony Cobel.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.047
And she works at Lumon?

31:20.130 --> 31:21.256
Yeah, she's my boss.

31:21.340 --> 31:22.508
Jesus fucking Christ.

31:50.619 --> 31:51.787
Dylan.

31:51.870 --> 31:53.163
Why are you doing this, man?

31:53.997 --> 31:54.998
Come on.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.794
You are the refiner of the quarter!

31:58.877 --> 32:01.630
"While most cultures view sex
as ugly or foul,

32:01.713 --> 32:03.215
- I've always seen it--"
- Mrs. Selvig?

32:03.298 --> 32:04.925
- What?
- Is she there? Is Mrs. Selvig there?

32:05.008 --> 32:05.843
- Do you--
- What?

32:05.926 --> 32:06.969
Mrs. Selvig?

32:07.052 --> 32:08.971
- What is going on?
- She has Eleanor!

32:09.054 --> 32:12.266
What? Excuse me a moment, okay.

32:12.349 --> 32:14.726
Honey? What did you say?

32:14.810 --> 32:17.729
Mrs. Selvig has Eleanor. Did you see her?

32:20.691 --> 32:22.067
- Oh, my God.
- What is going on?

32:22.150 --> 32:23.902
Oh, my God. Her car's gone.

32:23.986 --> 32:26.321
I gave her the baby, and she left!

32:26.905 --> 32:29.157
- She left? With Eleanor?
- I handed her the baby,

32:29.241 --> 32:30.242
and she left!

32:30.325 --> 32:32.244
- Have we looked everywhere?
- Not yet!

32:32.327 --> 32:33.787
Okay, let's go inside and look.

32:33.871 --> 32:34.705
Oh, my God!

32:59.813 --> 33:02.232
I bet the tempers were disappointed.

33:02.316 --> 33:04.067
I can still get you back in there.

33:04.568 --> 33:06.278
I can get you any perk you want, Dylan.

33:06.361 --> 33:09.198
Hey, there's stuff
you don't even know about.

33:09.281 --> 33:12.910
There's paintball,
there's coffee cozies.

33:12.993 --> 33:14.244
Dylan, come on!

33:15.412 --> 33:18.498
Just say the word, and I'll get you
a coffee cozy literally right now, Dylan.

33:18.582 --> 33:19.625
Come on, man!

33:19.708 --> 33:23.378
I wanna remember
my fucking kid being born!

33:25.547 --> 33:27.216
You have two others.

33:28.425 --> 33:29.635
I can tell you about 'em.

33:30.928 --> 33:32.554
Open the door,
and I'll tell you their names.

33:32.638 --> 33:33.514
Come on, Dylan.

33:35.349 --> 33:36.350
Dylan!

34:09.091 --> 34:10.092
It's rolling.

34:12.427 --> 34:14.847
<i>My name is Helena, and I'm an Eagan.</i>

34:16.431 --> 34:20.101
<i>So one of the things you learn growing up
as an Eagan is that the workers…</i>

34:21.018 --> 34:23.105
- We start in two minutes.
- Thanks.

34:23.188 --> 34:24.188
Good luck.

34:25.899 --> 34:28.652
I'll tee you up.
Just stick to the talking points.

34:28.735 --> 34:31.655
Use the line about
how you see your innie as your sister.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.574
- They'll love that.
- Got it.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.617
It's gonna be great.

35:20.954 --> 35:22.581
She's not in the baby room.

35:23.165 --> 35:24.875
Have all these rooms been checked?

35:27.669 --> 35:29.046
Thank God.

35:29.129 --> 35:30.631
Devon! I got her!

35:31.131 --> 35:34.259
Devon, she's here! I found her.

35:34.343 --> 35:35.761
I found your child.

35:36.929 --> 35:39.139
I'm the one who found her!

35:51.735 --> 35:52.861
Dylan!

35:55.030 --> 35:56.323
Dylan!

35:56.406 --> 35:57.574
<i>…improvements in morale,</i>

35:57.658 --> 35:59.535
<i>a happier workplace.</i>

36:00.577 --> 36:04.414
As with any transformative technology,
there have been setbacks.

36:04.498 --> 36:05.624
Bumps in the road.

36:05.707 --> 36:10.003
But I'm here tonight to tell you
that we are on the verge of a revolution.

36:10.087 --> 36:12.422
A kind and empathetic revolution

36:12.506 --> 36:13.924
that puts the human being…

36:14.007 --> 36:17.553
- Oh, my God!
- Is it you?

36:19.721 --> 36:21.139
What are you talking about?

36:22.766 --> 36:24.643
It is you, isn't it?

36:27.104 --> 36:29.022
I'm gonna kill your company.

36:30.190 --> 36:31.608
Your company!

36:32.526 --> 36:35.112
Who the hell do you think you are?

36:35.195 --> 36:38.156
No. Your friends are gonna suffer.

36:39.157 --> 36:41.368
Mark will suffer.

36:41.451 --> 36:43.537
You'll be long gone,

36:43.620 --> 36:49.042
but we will keep them alive, in pain.

36:49.626 --> 36:50.794
You're on.

36:50.878 --> 36:53.213
…decided that we could do better.

36:53.297 --> 36:56.508
He may never have seen
a severance chip in his lifetime,

36:56.592 --> 37:01.305
but it represents his gentle
and elegant vision made manifest.

37:01.388 --> 37:04.641
<i>But why don't we hear from someone
who can tell us all about it firsthand?</i>

37:06.852 --> 37:09.313
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honor,</i>

37:09.396 --> 37:10.564
Helena Eagan.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.615
Thank you, Natalie.

37:50.312 --> 37:51.438
Devon!

37:56.068 --> 37:57.236
<i>My name is Helly R.</i>

37:58.779 --> 38:00.030
I'm an innie.

38:01.698 --> 38:04.618
<i>And everything they've told you
about severance is a lie!</i>

38:04.701 --> 38:05.702
Devon!

38:08.205 --> 38:09.873
Burt!

38:11.333 --> 38:12.334
Burt!

38:12.417 --> 38:15.712
No, no, no. Listen, we're not happy.
We're miserable.

38:17.130 --> 38:18.590
Burt!

38:22.094 --> 38:23.387
They torture us down there!

38:23.971 --> 38:25.305
<i>Burt!</i>

38:25.389 --> 38:27.850
Devon! Please!

38:28.976 --> 38:30.060
We're prisoners!

38:31.436 --> 38:33.230
She's alive!

38:35.274 --> 38:36.275
Burt!
