WEBVTT

00:37.341 --> 00:39.713
You're fucking it up!

00:39.746 --> 00:41.550
You're doing great, keep trying.

00:53.774 --> 00:55.344
Look at Sue.

00:55.377 --> 00:57.616
Hey, Sue!

00:57.649 --> 00:59.152
- Oh...
- Damn.

00:59.185 --> 01:01.524
- Fuck you, too, Sue.
- That was for you.

01:01.557 --> 01:03.226
Started walking,
and all of a sudden you're

01:03.259 --> 01:05.130
God's gift to the Rez.

01:05.163 --> 01:06.801
Did you see that Facebook group
she started?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.504
- What?
- It's like a walking group.

01:08.537 --> 01:09.573
I got a invite the other day.

01:09.606 --> 01:10.608
I was like, "Fuck no."

01:10.641 --> 01:11.610
Fucking kidding me?

01:11.643 --> 01:12.646
I'm not gonna go walking

01:12.679 --> 01:13.815
with all the aunties.

01:13.848 --> 01:15.283
I'd rather die.

01:16.787 --> 01:18.758
You going to the conference
this weekend?

01:18.791 --> 01:20.127
I don't think so.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.530
Feel like I should stick around

01:21.563 --> 01:23.333
with everything
Bear's going through.

01:23.366 --> 01:24.703
There's always something going
on with those shitasses.

01:24.736 --> 01:28.210
Emotions, hormones, shit.

01:28.243 --> 01:29.747
He'll be fine.

01:29.780 --> 01:31.683
Shit, he's the same age
you were when you had him.

01:32.685 --> 01:34.355
Why would you say that?

01:34.388 --> 01:38.798
I-I think you were
a really responsible teen mom.

01:38.831 --> 01:40.669
And he'll be a good teen dad.

01:40.702 --> 01:42.304
I don't want him
to be a teen dad.

01:42.337 --> 01:43.641
Listen to me.

01:43.674 --> 01:46.212
White people go to CancÃºn.

01:46.245 --> 01:48.450
We go to IHS conferences.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.755
Okay? It's our way.

01:54.295 --> 01:57.201
If anything happens,
don't call 911, okay?

01:57.234 --> 01:58.303
It's too expensive.

01:58.336 --> 01:59.338
Just call Leon.

01:59.371 --> 02:00.642
Mom, I know.

02:00.675 --> 02:01.743
Don't worry.

02:02.746 --> 02:05.885
I'm just gonna kick
my feet up...

02:05.918 --> 02:08.624
rest the old bones.

02:08.657 --> 02:10.762
It'll be good not being
on a roof all day.

02:10.795 --> 02:12.264
Working man.

02:12.297 --> 02:14.737
- Mmm.
- You earned it.

02:14.770 --> 02:15.872
You deserve a weekend away, too.

02:15.905 --> 02:18.777
Just working all the time.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.819
It's a conference.

02:23.854 --> 02:26.325
It's still work.

02:41.489 --> 02:42.659
<i>The problem is</i>

02:42.692 --> 02:44.763
the understanding
of sovereignty.

02:44.796 --> 02:46.934
It's become a catchall term

02:46.967 --> 02:48.738
that's lost a lot
of its meaning.

02:48.771 --> 02:50.942
The future of Indian health
is sustainable programming

02:50.975 --> 02:54.883
away from the shackles of the
U.S. government-provided care.

02:54.916 --> 02:56.453
Think of it like, say,

02:56.486 --> 02:58.490
I don't know, a relationship.

02:58.524 --> 03:00.795
The energy you provide
is only as healthy

03:00.828 --> 03:04.268
as the energy you give yourself.

03:04.301 --> 03:05.939
Then again,

03:05.972 --> 03:07.676
what do I know
about healthy relationships?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.312
I'm just an Indian man, right?

03:14.455 --> 03:17.629
Joking aside,
sustainable tribal health

03:17.662 --> 03:19.332
takes investment in ourselves.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.336
- Hi.
- Scholarships, support,

03:21.369 --> 03:23.541
and eventually
facilities and equipment.

03:23.574 --> 03:26.279
It might take a long time,
but we are

03:26.312 --> 03:27.649
- absolutely worth it.
- Hey, girl.

03:27.682 --> 03:29.653
- What?
- These goals of self-sufficient

03:29.686 --> 03:31.991
health services probably aren't
achievable in my lifetime.

03:32.024 --> 03:34.328
- But I believe
in the future of our people.
- Shh.

03:34.361 --> 03:37.334
And it is for the future
that I do my work.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.838
Small steps.

03:38.871 --> 03:40.575
- But every step taken is part

03:40.608 --> 03:41.977
- of the journey
to true sovereignty.
- Yeah.

03:42.010 --> 03:43.714
As you attend your workshops
this weekend,

03:43.747 --> 03:45.852
bear in mind the power

03:45.885 --> 03:47.856
that you carry as Native people.

03:47.889 --> 03:50.528
Let's wield that power together.

03:51.563 --> 03:53.534
I'll wield my power on you.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.837
No ring. No hickeys.

03:54.870 --> 03:56.707
- Mmm.
- I call shotgun.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.477
Power to the matriarchs!
Women are sacred!

03:58.511 --> 04:01.049
- Probably got a white wife.
- Don't count.

04:01.082 --> 04:02.853
And what about you, Dr. Kang?

04:02.886 --> 04:04.455
You snag?

04:04.488 --> 04:06.660
What's "snag"?

04:08.429 --> 04:09.900
Noncommittal sex with someone

04:09.933 --> 04:11.436
you're definitely
gonna see again.

04:11.469 --> 04:15.578
See these? These are my kills.

04:15.611 --> 04:16.881
You get one anytime you snag

04:16.914 --> 04:18.551
with somebody
from the host tribe.

04:18.584 --> 04:20.522
Impressive achievements,
Beverly.

04:20.555 --> 04:22.391
Well, there's one
out there for you.

04:22.424 --> 04:24.095
- Me?
- Yeah.

04:24.128 --> 04:26.967
Maybe Crow, maybe Delaware.

04:27.000 --> 04:27.969
- Delaware.
- Chickasaw.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.305
Chickasaw.

04:29.338 --> 04:30.642
- Ho-Chunk.
- Ho-Chunks.

04:30.675 --> 04:32.044
But watch out
for bad medicine, though.

04:32.077 --> 04:33.648
Yeah, wear socks.

04:33.681 --> 04:34.983
Medicine comes up
through your feet.

04:35.016 --> 04:38.423
- Mm.
-"Socks-- wear them."

04:42.732 --> 04:44.836
Welcome, ladies.

04:44.869 --> 04:48.009
Here we have a-a crystal dildo.

04:48.042 --> 04:49.880
- Wow.
- Heals from within.

04:49.913 --> 04:51.917
- Hmm.
- Cleanses away

04:51.950 --> 04:54.923
spiritually-transmitted
diseases.

04:54.956 --> 04:56.594
- Mmm.
- Yeah, sister. It's okay.

04:56.627 --> 04:58.598
- That's for you.
- Damn.
- Wow.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.133
You guys got kids?

05:00.166 --> 05:01.537
Yeah, I got one.

05:01.570 --> 05:02.606
- Three.
- Not yet.

05:02.639 --> 05:04.643
- A niece.
- Ah. Okay.

05:04.676 --> 05:08.718
So, you two, this is for you.

05:08.751 --> 05:11.857
A workout of your pelvic floor.

05:11.890 --> 05:13.961
This stuff will tighten you up.

05:13.994 --> 05:15.865
Just perfect.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.370
And for our other sisters...

05:18.403 --> 05:19.806
Oh, God, this is good.

05:19.839 --> 05:20.875
- This is on the house.

05:20.908 --> 05:22.712
- Hmm. Thanks.
- Thank you.

05:22.745 --> 05:25.417
- Thank you.
-I love her.

05:46.092 --> 05:48.864
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey.

05:48.897 --> 05:50.568
Eyes down, ladies.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.572
Seminoles can impregnate you
with a single stare.

05:52.605 --> 05:53.840
God.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.788
That's how we used to look
way back in the day.

06:00.821 --> 06:02.191
Look at that!
Look at that!

06:02.224 --> 06:03.661
Oh, you got to engage like that.

06:03.694 --> 06:05.097
But we do...

06:05.130 --> 06:06.867
Oh, Natalie, there's your ex.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.573
...helps you to improve
your video game focus.

06:09.606 --> 06:11.109
Exes.

06:11.142 --> 06:13.113
I snagged Jumbo, too.

06:13.146 --> 06:15.083
Natalie!

06:15.116 --> 06:18.523
And Beverly!
You got my lanyard in there?

06:19.526 --> 06:21.697
I need edibles.

06:21.730 --> 06:23.433
Oh, I... I got a customer.
I got a customer. Hold on.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.435
Rita, check out your snag.

06:43.072 --> 06:45.578
- Sam!
- What are you doing?

06:45.611 --> 06:47.983
There's a free seat here!
Setting you up for success.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.553
You got to lock that down

06:49.586 --> 06:51.222
- before someone else does.
- Thanks.

06:51.255 --> 06:53.627
- May I?
- Yeah, it's all yours.

06:53.660 --> 06:54.696
You're welcome.

06:59.572 --> 07:01.710
What you reading?

07:01.743 --> 07:04.983
<i>Man Moon</i> by Beau Harrison.

07:05.016 --> 07:07.822
It's about recognizing
our sacred feminine.

07:07.855 --> 07:09.826
Hmm. I love fiction.

07:09.859 --> 07:12.231
Mm. So, where are you from?

07:12.264 --> 07:14.235
- From Chinle.
- Yeah.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.472
It's in Arizona in the middle
of the Navajo Nation.

07:16.506 --> 07:18.944
I work there.
What's your dad's name?

07:18.977 --> 07:20.682
- Alfred.
- Oh.

07:20.715 --> 07:23.754
You were just a little guy
when I saw him.

07:26.058 --> 07:28.898
What's it... what-what's it
like there in Arizona?

07:28.931 --> 07:30.868
It's beautiful-- the canyon,

07:30.901 --> 07:32.605
Canyon de Chelly.

07:32.638 --> 07:34.175
You should go visit sometime.

07:34.208 --> 07:38.049
Yeah. I'd like that.
Sounds hot.

07:40.588 --> 07:41.990
You have any kids?

07:42.023 --> 07:43.794
Not that I know of.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.940
- I'm a mom.
- How old?

07:49.973 --> 07:51.710
He's a teenager.

07:51.743 --> 07:53.514
- High school, huh?
- Yeah.

07:53.547 --> 07:55.618
- That's when they go
for the jugular.

07:55.651 --> 07:57.287
- I always knew I wanted
to help my people.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.091
I just didn't know how.

07:59.124 --> 08:00.995
I wanted to see more people like
us in the hospital, you know?

08:01.028 --> 08:03.534
So I went back to school
to get my medical degree.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.607
And it was a hard time
being away for so long,

08:06.640 --> 08:09.980
but it's nice to be back
in the community now,

08:10.013 --> 08:12.151
even if it's not my own.

08:12.184 --> 08:13.788
That's really cool.

08:13.821 --> 08:15.858
I always wanted
to go away to school.

08:15.891 --> 08:17.629
I told everyone
I was gonna go to New York

08:17.662 --> 08:20.200
and smoke cigarettes
on a fire escape.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.104
Just something I saw
in a movie once.

08:22.137 --> 08:24.175
So, did you?

08:24.208 --> 08:28.016
No. No, I didn't do any of that.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.922
Maybe when my son is grown up
and out of the house.

08:30.955 --> 08:33.727
There's just so many things
I want to do.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.731
I'll have to take you
to my favorite pizza spot

08:35.764 --> 08:38.035
out there sometime.

08:39.939 --> 08:42.210
Yeah. I'd like that.

08:46.686 --> 08:48.223
- It's my floor.

08:48.256 --> 08:50.227
I'll see you, uh,
at the bar later?

08:50.260 --> 08:52.297
Yeah, for sure.

08:55.805 --> 08:57.776
Oh.

08:57.809 --> 09:02.351
- Ooh. So pretty.
- Oh. Wow.
- Smells good.

09:02.384 --> 09:03.754
- It does smell good.
- Smells like

09:03.787 --> 09:05.792
my grandma's underwear drawer.

09:05.825 --> 09:07.862
Okay. Rita?

09:09.933 --> 09:11.670
<i>Biska</i> needs some attention.

09:14.642 --> 09:15.745
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Sit with your butt back.

09:15.778 --> 09:17.281
- Mmm.
- So your vag can go right

09:17.314 --> 09:18.818
- close to the steam.
- Oh. Oh!

09:18.851 --> 09:20.755
- That's it.
- Don't burn it.

09:20.788 --> 09:22.191
Oh.

09:22.224 --> 09:23.861
Oh, there it is.

09:23.894 --> 09:26.065
- Try to, like,
inhale from your...
- Oh.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.602
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.338
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:29.371 --> 09:33.146
Oh, yeah.

09:33.179 --> 09:35.250
How come we've never steamed
our <i>biskas</i> before?

09:35.283 --> 09:37.187
- We probably used to.

09:37.220 --> 09:39.693
- Yeah, old ways.
- All right, now focus.
- All right.

09:39.726 --> 09:41.262
- Mm-hmm.
- And ask for what you want.

09:41.295 --> 09:43.734
Like, out loud?

09:43.767 --> 09:45.905
Doesn't say.

09:45.938 --> 09:47.709
Wish for a giant <i>hvsh.</i>

09:47.742 --> 09:48.978
Yeah. Not too giant.

09:49.011 --> 09:50.648
- Medium.
- Medium, okay.

09:50.681 --> 09:53.152
- Fits just right.
- Long, long orgasm.

09:53.185 --> 09:54.856
- Yeah.
- Multiple. Lots of 'em.

09:54.889 --> 09:56.927
- Yes, multiple.
- Like an hour long.
- Okay.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.162
- Handcuffs.
- Yeah.

09:58.195 --> 10:00.066
- Just a little rough.
- Yeah.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.435
He's, like, fast like a rabbit.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.139
- No, I don't like that.
- New baby daddy.

10:03.172 --> 10:04.809
- Dr. Dad.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:04.842 --> 10:07.949
Okay.

10:07.982 --> 10:11.322
Ooh! Oh. Whew!

10:12.892 --> 10:14.061
Fuck.

10:14.094 --> 10:15.330
- What?

10:15.363 --> 10:17.802
- Fuck, I feel powerful.

10:17.835 --> 10:19.271
It works!

10:19.304 --> 10:21.743
Oh, shit. Bear called.

10:21.776 --> 10:23.379
I'm next.

10:26.185 --> 10:27.454
- What's up, Mom?
<i>- Hey, Bear.</i>

10:27.487 --> 10:28.423
How you doing?

10:28.456 --> 10:30.060
Yeah, I'm doing good.

10:30.093 --> 10:31.462
- How's the conference?
<i>- Yeah, it's good.</i>

10:31.495 --> 10:32.832
Yeah. Um...

10:32.865 --> 10:34.769
- All right, and focus...

10:34.802 --> 10:37.207
Did you get a pizza
with that money I left you?

10:37.240 --> 10:39.078
Yeah. It just got here.

10:39.111 --> 10:41.148
Okay, good.
And there's also frozen waffles

10:41.181 --> 10:43.186
in the freezer
if you need them for breakfast.

10:43.219 --> 10:45.123
<i>Let me know if you need
anything else, okay?</i>

10:45.156 --> 10:47.327
No, I'll be good. Probably just
gonna get some sleep anyways.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.131
Yeah, me, too.
It was a long day.

10:49.164 --> 10:51.435
You know, I'm tired.
All right, well,

10:51.468 --> 10:53.908
<i>- I love you, Bear.</i>
- All right. Love you, too, Mom.

10:53.941 --> 10:55.744
Bye.

10:56.746 --> 10:58.049
We good!

10:58.082 --> 11:00.821
- Domino, motherfucker!

11:26.205 --> 11:27.508
Aah!

11:31.215 --> 11:33.386
It's lively in here.

11:33.419 --> 11:34.856
Hello.

11:37.962 --> 11:39.866
Cast a wide net, hos.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.469
Let's catch
some motherfucking fish.

11:53.426 --> 11:55.297
We closed it down
last year.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.167
Yes.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.136
- Okay.

12:15.169 --> 12:18.176
Not a lot of dudes, but I see
a shit-ton of hot ladies.

12:18.209 --> 12:19.812
For you.

12:21.516 --> 12:23.019
What is this?

12:23.052 --> 12:24.288
Edible.

12:24.321 --> 12:26.125
I can't do this.
This is gonna fuck me up.

12:26.158 --> 12:27.528
It's only ten milligrams.

12:27.561 --> 12:29.164
- Live a little, Rita.
- Come on.

12:34.274 --> 12:35.777
- Oh, shit.
- What?

12:36.579 --> 12:38.049
These are 25 milligrams.

12:40.019 --> 12:41.957
- You are a shit.

12:41.990 --> 12:44.161
- Uh-oh.
- Mm-hmm.

12:54.481 --> 12:58.524
Your Indian name is Cipo.

12:58.557 --> 13:01.228
Wow. I love the way that sounds.

13:01.261 --> 13:02.832
- Mm.
- What's it mean?

13:02.865 --> 13:04.168
Cousin.

13:04.201 --> 13:06.038
Oh. It's beautiful.

13:06.071 --> 13:07.274
It rolls off the tongue.

13:07.307 --> 13:10.213
Can I get y'all another round?

13:10.246 --> 13:13.186
Hey. My name is Cipo.

13:13.219 --> 13:15.156
It means "cousin."

13:15.189 --> 13:18.128
Hey, cousin.
I like your braid.

13:19.164 --> 13:21.937
Hey, um, are you Crow?

13:21.970 --> 13:23.139
- No.
- Chickasaw?

13:23.172 --> 13:24.441
- No.
- Delaware?

13:24.474 --> 13:26.479
- No. I'm Tonkawa.
- Tonkawa?

13:26.513 --> 13:29.384
I like the... I'm wearing socks!

13:36.966 --> 13:38.302
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

13:41.676 --> 13:43.179
I think it's kicking in.

13:43.212 --> 13:45.183
What did you say?

13:45.216 --> 13:49.057
What?

13:51.428 --> 13:55.571
Oh.

13:55.604 --> 13:58.443
Yeah. It's kicking in?

13:58.476 --> 14:00.313
- Yeah?
- Yes, bitch.

14:03.419 --> 14:07.360
Oh, yeah, I feel it. Mmm.

14:07.393 --> 14:09.966
Yeah, I feel like...
I don't know what I feel.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.368
Oh, they're playing Brandy.

14:11.401 --> 14:13.540
Let's dance.
That'll fix it.

15:24.047 --> 15:25.751
Yes!

15:32.631 --> 15:33.767
Remember that time
we stole your mom's car,

15:33.800 --> 15:35.671
and we crashed it
into the creek?

15:35.704 --> 15:37.274
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.
- Like, fucked it right up?

15:37.307 --> 15:39.311
- It flooded the engine.
- Oh, my God.

15:39.344 --> 15:40.681
We were trying to go
to that party

15:40.714 --> 15:42.718
down in Bumfuck somewhere.

15:42.751 --> 15:46.025
Your homecoming crown--
it was stuck in the mud

15:46.058 --> 15:49.298
and just, like, all broken
and shit and all fucked-up.

15:49.331 --> 15:51.035
- I went back to get it, though.
- That's right.

15:51.068 --> 15:53.372
- That was the first night
I ever snagged.

15:53.405 --> 15:55.310
- The beginning of my ho days.
- Shit.

15:55.343 --> 15:57.447
I miss being a shitass.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.721
Mmm. Me, too. I don't want
to do dishes anymore.

16:00.754 --> 16:02.356
- Word.
- No.

16:03.359 --> 16:05.330
Y'all ever feel like

16:05.363 --> 16:08.302
we just went from being kids
to women overnight?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.772
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

16:09.805 --> 16:11.610
And no one even asked us.

16:11.643 --> 16:14.314
Just expected to be all sacred
and tradish all the time.

16:14.347 --> 16:16.318
Ugh. It's a lot, right?

16:16.351 --> 16:18.790
- Mm-hmm.
- Cleaning, cooking, mom-ing.

16:18.823 --> 16:20.594
Sewing, beading, weaving.

16:20.627 --> 16:22.330
Learning knowledge,
keeping knowledge,

16:22.363 --> 16:24.067
teaching knowledge,

16:24.100 --> 16:25.537
- making humans.
- Mm.

16:25.570 --> 16:27.073
Picking people up
from the drunk tank.

16:27.106 --> 16:28.744
- Oh.

16:28.777 --> 16:30.380
That's why we need
nights like this.

16:30.413 --> 16:31.783
So we can cut loose

16:31.816 --> 16:34.121
and let all that shit go
sometimes.

16:34.154 --> 16:35.322
Easy for you to say.

16:36.325 --> 16:38.129
What's that supposed to mean?

16:38.162 --> 16:40.233
You don't have any kids.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.571
- Neither does Bev.
- Well, I got a niece.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.476
Shit's hard.

16:45.510 --> 16:48.550
I'm not her mom,
but I got to be one to her.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.221
She puts up with me,

16:51.254 --> 16:52.758
but think she's gonna
burn all her hair off

16:52.791 --> 16:55.229
- with all that bleach.

16:55.262 --> 16:58.704
- Little shitass runaway. Fuck.
- Yeah, see?

16:58.737 --> 17:00.507
You get to pick and choose
what you want to be a part of.

17:00.540 --> 17:01.810
We don't get to.

17:01.843 --> 17:03.847
You think that's easier?

17:03.880 --> 17:06.586
I'm just saying
that you don't have

17:06.619 --> 17:09.291
to deal with the same things
that we do. You're lucky.

17:09.324 --> 17:12.130
You don't know what I have to
deal with, Rita. None of you do.

17:12.163 --> 17:13.399
Yeah, because you left.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.103
Well, what was I supposed to do?

17:15.136 --> 17:17.274
Waste my life working the
gas station, pumping out babies?

17:19.845 --> 17:23.119
That's what you might tell
yourself, but the truth is,

17:23.152 --> 17:25.690
is that you bailed on us
after Cookie died.

17:27.728 --> 17:30.133
Rita, I went to school,

17:30.166 --> 17:32.304
I worked, I joined
the fucking mili...

17:32.337 --> 17:33.740
You know what?

17:33.773 --> 17:34.675
Fuck this.

17:41.388 --> 17:42.858
I'm still snagging.

17:42.891 --> 17:44.795
Shit.

17:49.872 --> 17:52.143
Come on. Let's go dance.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.403
Hey, Rita?

18:05.436 --> 18:07.273
There's your man.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.551
Do I look super fucked-up?

18:12.584 --> 18:15.724
No. No. Just fix your lips
and push your titties up.

18:26.178 --> 18:28.415
Did you miss me?

18:59.879 --> 19:03.553
Oh...

19:13.405 --> 19:15.442
Mm.

19:17.514 --> 19:19.786
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

19:19.819 --> 19:23.593
Rita?

19:28.435 --> 19:31.241
You have a tampon, Teenie?

19:39.725 --> 19:42.397
Luckily, Indian men don't care
about your moon time.

19:42.430 --> 19:45.838
Don't matter.
I think a niece swooped him.

19:45.871 --> 19:47.575
Oof. Brutal.

19:49.444 --> 19:51.448
Used to it, though.

19:51.481 --> 19:54.254
In the city, men don't even
look at you if you're over 25.

19:54.287 --> 19:57.862
I don't get it.

19:57.895 --> 19:59.565
Everyone talks
about honoring women.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.569
"You're beautiful matriarchs."

20:01.602 --> 20:03.974
Except no one's
doing shit for us,

20:04.007 --> 20:05.844
not even giving us orgasms.

20:08.983 --> 20:11.221
I just want to feel sexy again.

20:11.989 --> 20:14.528
Yeah.

20:47.493 --> 20:49.464
I know I don't know
what you go through,

20:49.497 --> 20:52.403
but it looks pretty nice
from here.

20:55.877 --> 21:00.018
I'd kill to have kids
and work at IHS.

21:02.390 --> 21:05.295
It's lonely being so far away.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.470
Sometimes I wish I could get
into, like, a mild accident.

21:10.507 --> 21:12.745
So I could go to the hospital
for, like, five days to a week.

21:12.778 --> 21:14.615
- Have some free food

21:14.648 --> 21:17.020
and have people take care of me.

21:17.053 --> 21:20.928
Get a comfy bed and those
wool socks that they give you.

21:20.961 --> 21:23.365
You know, that huge jug
of water that's always iced

21:23.398 --> 21:25.369
with crushed ice.

21:25.402 --> 21:28.042
Just so I could be alone.

21:28.075 --> 21:30.681
So, you mean, like, a vacation?

21:30.714 --> 21:34.054
Well, yeah, that's what
I'd have to do to get one.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.803
I wish things were simpler.

21:41.836 --> 21:44.775
I miss when we could all just

21:44.808 --> 21:48.917
sit in bed all day,
the three of us, and watch TV.

22:40.787 --> 22:42.758
Wait. Is that the same guy

22:42.791 --> 22:45.631
- from the beginning?
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.500
I remember this one.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.870
The husband killed the wife
because, um,

22:48.903 --> 22:50.674
he got his mistress pregnant.

22:50.707 --> 22:51.976
Why do you have
to go kill the whole family?

22:52.009 --> 22:53.546
Just get a divorce.

22:53.579 --> 22:56.118
- Hmm.
- Mm.

22:56.151 --> 22:59.592
Ugh!

22:59.625 --> 23:02.163
Tee, will you hold my hair?

23:02.196 --> 23:03.733
Yeah, it's gonna happen.

23:03.766 --> 23:06.138
- Oh, shit. Well...
- Yeah.

23:41.809 --> 23:43.846
You okay?

23:44.815 --> 23:47.052
I finally snagged.
