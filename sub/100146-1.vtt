00:01.500 --> 00:04.000
SPENCER JAMES?
BILLY BAKER,

00:04.000 --> 00:05.470
VARSITY COACH
BEVERLY HIGH.

00:05.470 --> 00:07.000
I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE,
SPENCER.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.410
I NEED YOU TO COME
PLAY FOR ME.

00:08.410 --> 00:10.170
-BUT YOU CAN'T RECRUIT.
-I CAN GET AROUND THAT.

00:10.170 --> 00:12.180
ANNOUNCER: JAMES SHOOTS
THE GAP AND BLOCKS IT!

00:13.180 --> 00:16.210
TOUCHDOWN BEVERLY!

00:16.210 --> 00:21.020
YOUR NEW STATE CHAMPIONS
THE BEVERLY HIGH EAGLES!

00:21.020 --> 00:23.520
MAN: LAPD!
DROP THE GUN! DROP IT!

00:23.520 --> 00:25.220
COOP: IT'S ALL OVER NOW.
ALL I HAD TO DO

00:25.220 --> 00:26.460
WAS SET THE BAIT.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.020
IS EVERYTHING OK?

00:28.020 --> 00:30.030
I HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH GRACE JAMES.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.930
JORDAN: WAS IT WORTH IT?
YOU SACRIFICED

00:31.930 --> 00:33.060
YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY,
BUY, HEY,

00:33.060 --> 00:35.000
YOU FINALLY GOT
THAT ELUSIVE WIN

00:35.000 --> 00:37.030
YOU SO DESPERATELY
WANTED, RIGHT, DAD?

00:37.030 --> 00:39.200
SPENCER: I DON'T
HAVE A FATHER,
NOT ANYMORE.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.900
GRACE: COREY LEFT
A FEW YEARS BACK.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.910
HE WENT TO COACH
COLLEGE BALL IN NEVADA.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.440
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
HIM SINCE.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.910
COREY: I WANT YOU TO
MOVE BACK HOME,
COME PLAY FOR ME.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.010
SO YOU GONNA BE
THE HEAD COACH
OF SOUTH CRENSHAW?

00:49.010 --> 00:50.480
DID YOU REALLY
COME BACK FOR
HIS FIRST GAME

00:50.480 --> 00:52.080
LIKE YOU PROMISED?

00:52.080 --> 00:53.480
-YEAH.
-THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU TELL ME

00:53.480 --> 00:54.950
THAT YOU WERE THERE?

00:54.950 --> 00:56.620
THEN I WOULD HAVE HAD
TO FINALLY ASK

00:56.620 --> 00:59.960
IF DILLON WAS MY SON
OR BILLY'S.

SPENCER: 33 YEARS YOUNG.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.080
IT DON'T MAKE
NO DAMN SENSE.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.480
IT NEVER DOES.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.550
THAT NEW?

02:03.550 --> 02:07.020
NAW. IT WAS A GIFT
FROM SHAWN.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.890
PENDANT MEANS

02:09.890 --> 02:14.560

IT'S A PARTY CELEBRATING
THE EAGLES' BIG WIN,

02:43.030 --> 02:45.930
BUT REAL TALK--
PARTYING WITH THEM
DON'T FEEL RIGHT,

02:45.930 --> 02:48.000
NOT WITH MY COMMUNITY
HURTING THIS BAD.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.360
MAN, TUESDAY, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE YOUR
CHANCE TO HONOR

02:49.360 --> 02:51.270
NIPSEY

02:51.270 --> 02:52.940
TODAY, YOU GOT
TO CELEBRATE
THAT BIG WIN.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.540
YEAH, YOU RIGHT,
ESPECIALLY SINCE THAT'S

02:54.540 --> 02:56.470
MY LAST CHAMPIONSHIP

03:01.940 --> 03:03.380

THIS MY DAD WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT,

03:04.950 --> 03:07.980
MY FAMILY, COMING HOME
TO CRENSHAW.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.550
IS THERE REALLY
A DECISION TO MAKE?

03:10.550 --> 03:12.250

TO GET ME TO BEVERLY.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.430
I OWE THEM

03:21.430 --> 03:23.330
I FEEL YOU, MAN,

IT'S JASMINE.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.530
TWO DAYS AGO,
IT WAS REAGAN.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.090
LAST WEEK CRYSTALA.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.860
WOW. GO, JORDAN.

04:26.860 --> 04:28.400
IT'S LIKE HIS WAY
OF DEALING WITH OUR
FAMILY DRAMA

04:28.400 --> 04:29.970
IS BY CREATING HIS OWN

04:29.970 --> 04:31.330
GROSS VERSION
OF "THE BACHELOR."

04:31.330 --> 04:34.040
LIV, HE'S QB-1
ON A CHAMPIONSHIP-
WINNING TEAM.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.340
HE'S JUST TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF HIS NEW CELEB STATUS.

04:36.340 --> 04:38.310
HE'S FINE.

04:38.310 --> 04:41.440
SO YOU'VE BEEN
A HARD PERSON TO REACH
OVER WINTER BREAK.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.510
UM, YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO DISAPPEARED
TO LAKE TAHOE

04:43.510 --> 04:45.050
WITH YOUR MOM
AND JORDAN.

04:45.050 --> 04:47.220
MAGICALLY, PHONES
STILL WORK UP THERE.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.480
-OH. OK.
-I MEAN, I LEFT YOU MESSAGES.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.090
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.290
I'M GREAT.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.090
LAYLA, YOU KIND OF
HAD A BREAKDOWN

04:54.090 --> 04:55.220
AFTER THE GAME.

04:55.220 --> 04:56.960
I MEAN, YOU TORE UP
YOUR HOUSE.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.990
OK. IT WAS NOT
A BREAKDOWN.

04:58.990 --> 05:00.900
I WAS JUST MAD
AT MY DAD

05:00.900 --> 05:02.860
FOR NOT TAKING
THE FIRST BREAK-IN
SERIOUSLY,

05:02.860 --> 05:04.200
SO I KIND OF JUST TOOK
IT OUT ON HIS CRAP

05:04.200 --> 05:05.830
AND LET HIM THINK THERE
WAS ANOTHER BREAK-IN.

05:05.830 --> 05:07.900
THAT'S IT,
AND IT WORKED

05:07.900 --> 05:09.500
BECAUSE NOW HE'S BACK,

05:09.500 --> 05:11.140
AND WE'RE SPENDING
QUALITY TIME TOGETHER

05:11.140 --> 05:13.880
HOUSE HUNTING,
AND EVERYTHING'S PERFECT.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.440
JORDAN: HEY, LAYLA.
LAYLA: HEY.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.150
WHERE'S SPENCER?
I COULD USE

05:17.150 --> 05:19.610
HIS QUICK FEET
RIGHT ABOUT NOW
TO SHUT JJ UP.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.520
HE'S ON HIS WAY,
BUT IF YOU'RE DOWN A MAN

05:21.520 --> 05:23.090
FOR 7 ON 7, I CAN FILL IN.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.220
JASMINE: OK. JJ IS SERIOUSLY
STILL RUNNING HIS MOUTH.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.890
YOU PLAYING, JORDAN?

05:26.890 --> 05:28.260
LAYLA: OK, QB-1.
LET'S GO.

05:28.260 --> 05:30.230
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT
QUICK FEET LOOK LIKE.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.990
OK.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.430
JORDAN: HEY, GUYS.
WE DON'T HAVE SPENCE,

05:33.430 --> 05:35.260
BUT EVEN BETTER,
WE GOT LAYLA.

05:38.030 --> 05:42.040
BRO, WHEN YOU
GONNA TELL HER?

05:42.040 --> 05:42.970
TELL WHO WHAT?

05:42.970 --> 05:44.610
DUDE, YOU LOOK
AT OLIVIA

05:44.610 --> 05:46.880
THE WAY MY MOM LOOKS
AT HER BENTLEY.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.610
OH, WHATEVER, MAN.
YOU'RE TRIPPING.
TRIPPING.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.910
I CALL IT
HOW I SEE IT, MAN.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.990
HEY. WHO'S READY
TO PLAY FOOTBALL?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.250
♪ FEEL THE THUNDER,

05:59.250 --> 06:03.460

06:13.100 --> 06:15.040
HEY, HEY, HEY.
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

06:15.040 --> 06:16.840
ABOUT TO PUT THEM
CHIPS ON MY SANDWICH

06:16.840 --> 06:18.410
AND RUIN
THE WHOLE THING.

06:18.410 --> 06:19.880
BOY, YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.280
THIS CRUNCH WILL
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.180
THIS CRUNCH
WILL BREAK
YOUR DENTURES.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.950
HA HA HA! AHH.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.280
GRACE, TELL THAT BOY
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

06:28.280 --> 06:31.520
UH-UH. I AM STAYING
OUT OF THIS. HA HA HA!

06:31.520 --> 06:33.920
DILLON, HONEY,
I HAVE TO WORK
LATE TOMORROW,

06:33.920 --> 06:35.890
SO COOP IS GONNA
PICK YOU UP
FROM SCHOOL.

06:35.890 --> 06:38.290
CAN DAD?

06:38.290 --> 06:41.630
PLEASE.

06:41.630 --> 06:44.530
SON, GRAB YOUR SANDWICH,
GO IN THE ROOM,

06:44.530 --> 06:45.930
GET OUT A PUZZLE.

06:45.930 --> 06:47.270
I'LL BE IN THERE
IN A MINUTE.

06:47.270 --> 06:48.440
GOT IT.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.880
OK. TIME'S UP.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.180
EXCUSE ME?

06:57.180 --> 06:59.110
LOOK. WHEN I BROUGHT UP
DILLON'S PATERNITY,

06:59.110 --> 07:00.820
YOU WERE ADAMANT YOU
WOULDN'T DISCUSS IT

07:00.820 --> 07:02.480
THEN WITH THE BOYS
IN THE HOUSE.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.020
I STILL AM.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.220
OK.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.260
AND SINCE THEN,
YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH
AVOIDED ME.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.300
FOR THE RECORD,
I HAVEN'T BEEN
AVOIDING YOU.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.530
HEY. WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO CALL IT THEN.

07:15.530 --> 07:17.930
LOOK. I'VE BEEN
GRACIOUS,

07:17.930 --> 07:19.370
BUT NOW TIME'S UP.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.440
I'D LIKE A ANSWER
TO MY QUESTION.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.240
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WHAT, I WAS TAKING

07:25.240 --> 07:26.880
TOO LONG TO GET
BACK TO YOU,
SO NOW YOU'RE

07:26.880 --> 07:28.510
TRYING TO PRESSURE
ME THROUGH MOM?

07:28.510 --> 07:30.380
-SON, I WASN'T--
-WAIT. HOLD UP.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.180
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, SPENCER?

07:34.950 --> 07:37.890
SOMEBODY BETTER
START TALKING.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.420
I'VE ASKED SPENCER
TO COME PLAY FOR ME

07:39.420 --> 07:40.990
AT SOUTH CRENSHAW.

07:40.990 --> 07:42.220
-YOU WHAT?
-MA.

07:42.220 --> 07:43.990
NAW. DON'T "MA" ME.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.570
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING,

07:50.570 --> 07:52.830
BUT THIS CONVERSATION
IS FAR FROM OVER.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.810
HELLO?

08:09.050 --> 08:11.520
RICKY, DOS MAS.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.920
SORRY, BILLY. I'M
GONNA HAVE TO CUT
YOU OFF, MY MAN.

08:17.790 --> 08:20.400
OK.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.770
HEY. LOOK WHO'S HERE.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.930
THANKS FOR CALLING.

08:25.930 --> 08:28.070
AGAIN.

08:28.070 --> 08:30.000
TWICE LAST WEEK,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.710
3 TIMES THIS WEEK.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.440
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'M COMING TO GET YOU
LIKE THIS.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.580
HEH HEH HEH.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.650
ARE YOU GONNA
WASH YOUR HANDS
OF ME, TOO?

08:38.650 --> 08:40.480
LOOK. I KNOW BEING
AWAY FROM THE KIDS

08:40.480 --> 08:42.550
AND LIVING WITH A FATHER
THAT YOU BARELY SPEAK TO

08:42.550 --> 08:44.620
IS HARDER THAN YOU
ANTICIPATED,

08:44.620 --> 08:49.020
BUT I OF ALL PEOPLE
CAN'T BE THE ONE TO
SEE YOU THROUGH THIS,

08:49.020 --> 08:51.390
NOT IF YOU EVER PLAN
ON GETTING LAURA BACK.

08:51.390 --> 08:54.460
-I MISS HER, GRACIE.
-WELL, THEN BOSS UP

08:54.460 --> 08:56.730
AND DO WHAT YOU SAID
YOU MOVED BACK
TO CRENSHAW TO DO.

08:56.730 --> 08:59.800
GET YOURSELF TOGETHER
SO YOU CAN GET THEM BACK.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.470
NOW LET'S GO,
AND YOU BETTER

09:01.470 --> 09:02.940
BE ABLE TO WALK
BECAUSE AIN'T NOBODY

09:02.940 --> 09:04.470
DRAGGING YOUR ASS
TO THE CAR.

09:06.610 --> 09:09.910
BOY: HEY. BEST LINEBACKER
IN THE STATE.

09:09.910 --> 09:12.350
-CHEERS, BABY!
-CHEERS, BABY!

09:15.050 --> 09:18.720
OH. LADIES

CHAMPIONSHIP MVP

09:21.460 --> 09:25.330

09:56.820 --> 09:58.090
SPENCER: WHATEVER.

09:58.090 --> 09:59.460
WELL, IT'S
WELL-DESERVED.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.960
YOU DID WIN US
A CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER ALL.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.470
LET'S BOUNCE,

10:07.470 --> 10:09.470

10:09.470 --> 10:11.040
BUT I JUST HATE

10:11.040 --> 10:12.940

10:22.450 --> 10:24.390

10:24.390 --> 10:26.150
WHEN DID YOU
GET BACK?

10:26.150 --> 10:29.490
I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY
TO INTERN FOR AFS AGENCY.

10:29.490 --> 10:31.430
WAIT. THE SPORTS AGENCY?
THAT'S AMAZING.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.560
RIGHT? HENCE THE BREAK
FROM COLLEGE.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.830
WASN'T GONNA LET
THAT PASS ME BY.

10:36.830 --> 10:38.900
28 TOUCHDOWN RECEPTIONS,

10:38.900 --> 10:40.770
131 CATCHES,

10:40.770 --> 10:44.070

10:44.070 --> 10:45.710

SEASON.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.680

SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

10:59.850 --> 11:02.390
MY DAD'S ALSO ONE
OF BEVERLY'S MOST
INFLUENTIAL BOOSTERS,

11:02.390 --> 11:04.090
SO IT COMES NATURALLY.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.360

FOOTBALL FRANCHISE

11:17.640 --> 11:21.910

HEY, COACH BAKER.

11:42.430 --> 11:44.430

GRANDPA WILLIE.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.070

12:56.100 --> 12:58.010
WHAT ARE YOU

12:58.010 --> 12:59.470
LAYLA, ONE MINUTE,
YOU'RE DESTROYING

12:59.470 --> 13:00.810
YOUR HOUSE
WITH YOUR BARE HANDS,

13:00.810 --> 13:02.640
AND THE NEXT YOU'RE

13:02.640 --> 13:04.480
-WHAT'S UP?
-LOOK. I LOVE THAT YOUR THING

13:04.480 --> 13:06.480

BUT I PROMISE YOU

13:06.480 --> 13:07.850
I DON'T NEED SAVING.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.020
I'M GOOD.
I'M JUST TIRED

13:10.020 --> 13:12.850
FROM GOING OVER
HOUSE STUFF WITH MY DAD.

13:12.850 --> 13:14.120
WHAT'S UP?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.020
AND MY DAY JUST
GOT BETTER.

13:18.730 --> 13:20.460
OK?

13:20.460 --> 13:22.660
MM-HMM.

13:22.660 --> 13:24.900
SO...HOW'S CHRIS' REHAB

13:24.900 --> 13:26.570
AT THE ATLANTA FACILITY
GOING?

13:26.570 --> 13:29.370
HIS PARENTS SAID HE'S
STILL NOT READY TO
TAKE MY CALLS.

13:29.370 --> 13:30.910
HE DOESN'T BLAME
YOU FOR THE HIT.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.570
IT'S JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW, TALKING
TO YOU,

13:33.570 --> 13:36.410
IT'S A REMINDER
HOW CLOSE HE CAME
TO BEING PARALYZED.

13:36.410 --> 13:39.380
I GET IT. SO I'M
GIVING HIM SPACE
TILL HE'S READY.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.150
SPEAKING OF SPACE,

13:41.150 --> 13:43.380
WHEN ARE YOU MOVING
BACK IN?

13:43.380 --> 13:44.720
I MEAN, YOU COMMUTING
ALL THE WAY

13:44.720 --> 13:46.450
FROM CRENSHAW
TO SCHOOL IS CRAZY.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.460
NOT TO MENTION ILLEGAL.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.590
LOOK. SAME REASON
I AIN'T TRYING TO
REMIND CHRIS

13:49.590 --> 13:51.530
OF THE WORST MOMENT
IN HIS LIFE,

13:51.530 --> 13:52.930
I AIN'T TRYING TO
DO THAT TO YOUR MOM
NEITHER.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.930
MY MOM IS
SURPRISINGLY FINE.

13:54.930 --> 13:57.100
I MEAN, SHE'S HANDLING
THE SEPARATION BETTER
THAN ANY OF US.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.670
FOOTBALL SEASON'S OVER.
I'M HALFWAY THROUGH
THE SCHOOL YEAR.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.070
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA KNOW
OR CARE WHERE I'M
COMMUTING FROM.

14:03.070 --> 14:05.010
IT'S ALL GOOD.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.340
SPENCER: SEE YOU.
LAYLA: BYE.

14:24.190 --> 14:26.130

USE YOUR WEAKNESSES
AGAINST YOU,

14:29.860 --> 14:33.030
NOT JUST ENEMIES.

14:33.030 --> 14:34.640
BUT, MAN, I BEEN CALLING

14:34.640 --> 14:36.800

14:44.980 --> 14:46.950
YOU SAVED MY LIFE?
BECAUSE OF YOU,

14:46.950 --> 14:48.550
THEY HAD TO DIG
4 BULLETS UP
OUT OF ME.

14:48.550 --> 14:51.080
YOUR NEED TO
MESS AROUND WITH
GROWN FOLKS' BUSINESS

14:51.080 --> 14:53.820
AND WAR ON TYRONE
ALMOST GOT ME PUT
IN THE GROUND.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.930
IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOOD FOR YOU, COOP,

14:58.930 --> 15:00.990

15:22.280 --> 15:24.890

15:24.890 --> 15:26.520
JORDAN: BACK TO BACK.
ASHER: BACK TO BACK, MAN.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.290

15:34.960 --> 15:36.400

I THINK IT WAS
IN THE SECOND.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.070
HEY. HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.970
I GOT TO TELL
Y'ALL SOMETHING.

15:40.970 --> 15:42.970
LANDON: THERE THEY ARE!

15:42.970 --> 15:46.470
HOW'S IT FEEL?
STATE CHAMPS!

15:46.470 --> 15:47.870
PROUD OF YOU BOYS.

15:47.870 --> 15:49.010
THANKS,
PRINCIPAL LANDON.

15:49.010 --> 15:50.540
I HOPE YOUR DAD
IS ENJOYING

15:50.540 --> 15:51.950
HIS WELL-EARNED
VACATION.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.450
I GAVE HIM
THAT EXTRA WEEK,

15:53.450 --> 15:55.020
BUT TELL HIM HE NEEDS
TO HUSTLE BACK.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.180
WE NEED YOU BOYS
IN FIGHTING SHAPE

15:56.180 --> 15:57.880
FOR THE 7-ON-7
SCRIMMAGE LEAGUE.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.090
-YES, SIR.
-YES, SIR.

15:59.090 --> 16:00.450
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

16:01.390 --> 16:03.320
WE'RE GONNA GET TO CLASS.
WE'LL CATCH YOU LATER, YEAH?

16:03.320 --> 16:04.830
JJ: PEACE, PEACE.

16:04.830 --> 16:07.130
HEY. HOLD UP. VACATION?

16:07.130 --> 16:09.230
I THOUGHT YOU SAID BILLY
WAS AT GW's.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.470
LOOK. WHO KNOWS, OK?
I GOT TO GET TO CLASS.

16:18.870 --> 16:20.840
BILLY: I FIGURED
IT WOULD ONLY BE
A MATTER OF TIME

16:20.840 --> 16:22.110
BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.910
AIN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE ON VACATION?

16:23.910 --> 16:25.280
THAT'S WHAT PRINCIPAL
LANDON THINKS.

16:25.280 --> 16:28.150
VACATION?

16:28.150 --> 16:31.350
NO, SON. I RESIGNED.

16:31.350 --> 16:34.420
WHY WOULD LANDON SAY
I--

16:36.460 --> 16:39.090
JORDAN MUST HAVE TAKEN
MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION
FROM OFF MY DESK.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.860
SO YOU QUITTING
ON THE TEAM,

16:41.860 --> 16:42.960
ON THE JOB YOU LOVE?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.400
-I'M PRIORITIZING.
-NAW, MAN.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.000
YOU PUNISHING
YOURSELF.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.100
-WHAT ABOUT JORDAN?
-JORDAN DON'T WANT ME THERE.

16:48.100 --> 16:51.640
IF THAT WERE TRUE,
HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN THAT LETTER.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.370
AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

16:53.370 --> 16:55.580
YOU BROUGHT ME
TO BEVERLY, MAN,

16:55.580 --> 16:57.880
AND HOW YOU LEAVE,
AND YOU CAN'T BE MAN
ENOUGH TO TELL ME

16:57.880 --> 16:58.950
TO MY FACE?

16:58.950 --> 17:00.810
LOOK, SPENCER.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

17:00.810 --> 17:01.950
HOW HARD THIS DECISION
WAS TO MAKE.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.820
ACTUALLY, I DO.
I REALLY DO.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.490
MORE THAN YOU KNOW.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.290
IT JUST HURTS THAT
YOU WOULDN'T CARE
ENOUGH

17:07.290 --> 17:09.360
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO GIVE ME A HEAD'S UP.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.090
I'D NEVER DO THAT
TO YOU.

17:12.090 --> 17:15.400
-IN FACT, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:15.400 --> 17:18.300
MY POPS IS
THE NEW HEAD COACH
AT SOUTH CRENSHAW,

17:18.300 --> 17:22.840
AND HE WANTS ME TO
COME PLAY FOR HIM
IN THE FALL.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.240
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING
ON DOING?

17:24.240 --> 17:26.440
WHY YOU CARE?

17:26.440 --> 17:29.380
YOU'RE NOT THE COACH
AT BEVERLY NO MORE.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.980
RIGHT?

17:33.580 --> 17:35.520
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.930
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S DILLON?

17:48.930 --> 17:50.860
I TOOK DILLON
ACROSS THE STREET

17:50.860 --> 17:52.370
FOR A PLAY DATE
WITH GAVIN.

17:52.370 --> 17:54.430
WITHOUT CHECKING
WITH ME FIRST?

17:54.430 --> 17:56.940
WE NEED TO TALK ALONE.

18:01.110 --> 18:04.410
GRACE, WHATEVER ANSWER
YOU GIVE ME,

18:04.410 --> 18:07.080
THERE'S NO JUDGMENT,
NO ANGER.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.050
I--I MADE PEACE
WITH THE FACT

18:09.050 --> 18:11.990
THAT DILLON MAY
BE BILLY'S
A WHILE AGO.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.890
I JUST NEED TO KNOW.

18:14.890 --> 18:18.360
THE TRUTH IS...

18:18.360 --> 18:20.260
I DON'T KNOW.

18:20.260 --> 18:24.460
AT FIRST, I WAS
TOO SCARED TO EVEN
ASK THE QUESTION,

18:24.460 --> 18:26.000
BUT THEN YOU LEFT
ANYWAYS.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.600
-WAIT A MINUTE NOW.
-NO.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.970
-I--
-NO, NO, NO. YOU WAIT A MINUTE.

18:28.970 --> 18:32.910
YOU WANT TO TALK, COREY?
LET'S REALLY TALK.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.980
WE MADE VOWS
FOR BETTER OR WORSE,

18:35.980 --> 18:40.450
AND I MADE A MISTAKE,
I MADE ONE BIG MISTAKE,

18:40.450 --> 18:44.850
AND YOU PUNISH US ALL
BY LEAVING THE BOYS
FOR 8 YEARS?

18:44.850 --> 18:48.020
8 YEARS!

18:48.020 --> 18:50.920
I HAD TO RAISE SPENCER
AND DILLON BY MYSELF.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.560
SO, NO, YOU DON'T GET
TO WALK UP IN HERE

18:52.560 --> 18:55.960
AND PUT DEMANDS ON ME
OR MY BOYS!

18:55.960 --> 18:59.470
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO
THEY ARE--THEY'RE MINE.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.900
NOW IF YOU WILL
EXCUSE ME,

19:02.900 --> 19:04.940
I GOT TO GO
PICK UP MY SON

19:04.940 --> 19:06.740
FROM AN UNSANCTIONED
PLAY DATE.

19:37.370 --> 19:39.110
-WHAT?
-STEALING FROM MOM

19:39.110 --> 19:40.840
TO SUPPORT YOUR
HAREM OF HOS
ISN'T THE ANSWER

19:40.840 --> 19:42.480
TO YOUR PROBLEMS.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.110
OH, OK. WHY DON'T
YOU JUST--I DON'T KNOW--

19:44.110 --> 19:45.480
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.880
WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR BUSINESS?

19:50.050 --> 19:51.890
BILLY: HEY.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.460
MISSED YOU, DAD.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.460
YEAH. ME, TOO.

20:04.030 --> 20:07.070
I, UH, WANTED TO
GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME SPACE

20:07.070 --> 20:11.000
LAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS, SO...

20:11.000 --> 20:12.940
UH, TAHOE.
HOW WAS TAHOE?

20:12.940 --> 20:14.880
-BOUGIE.
-HA HA HA!

20:14.880 --> 20:17.010
LOOK. YOU--YOU
SHOULDN'T BE HERE, OK?

20:17.010 --> 20:19.010
MOM WOULDN'T WANT TO
SEE YOU.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.950
YEAH. I FIGURED
AS MUCH.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.280
THAT'S WHY I WAITED
FOR HER TO LEAVE.

20:23.280 --> 20:24.950
UH, WE SHOULD TALK.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.890
JORDAN, DID YOU
TAKE SOME--

20:26.890 --> 20:28.990
A LETTER
FROM MY OFFICE

20:28.990 --> 20:30.090
LAST TIME
WE WERE THERE?

20:30.090 --> 20:32.390
YOU MEAN YOUR
RESIGNATION LETTER.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.390
NO. I MEAN,
I READ IT, YEAH,

20:34.390 --> 20:36.030
BUT I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.600
WAIT. WHAT?

20:37.600 --> 20:40.230
JORDAN, YOU WERE
THE ONLY ONE THERE,
SOME COME ON.

20:40.230 --> 20:41.500
I--I NEED IT BACK.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.970
YEAH. OF COURSE YOU
DON'T BELIEVE ME

20:42.970 --> 20:44.600
BECAUSE, WHAT, LYING
IS A BAKER MAN TRAIT, RIGHT?

20:44.600 --> 20:46.170
HEY.

20:46.170 --> 20:50.680
LAURA: GUYS, HAS ANYONE
SEEN MY WALLET?

20:50.680 --> 20:53.110
OH. H-HI.

20:53.110 --> 20:55.020
HEY.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.120
IS EVERYTHING
OK, KIDS?

20:57.120 --> 20:58.290
YEAH.

21:06.190 --> 21:08.600
I DON'T MIND YOU
COMING BY TO SEE
THE KIDS,

21:08.600 --> 21:11.000
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD
CALL NEXT TIME.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.070
OF COURSE. YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.880
-SNITCH.
-SNITCH.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.010
-LOOK AT THAT SNITCH.
-YO, SNITCH.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.650
COME ON, MAN.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.550
OK. I MEAN, I KNOW
SOME PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE BEEF WITH YOU

21:28.550 --> 21:30.520
HELPING THE COPS
TAKE DOWN TYRONE,
BUT COME ON.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.090
IT'S A LITTLE MUCH.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.050
HEY. YOU GUYS STILL GOING
TO NIPSEY'S VIGIL TONIGHT?

21:34.050 --> 21:35.590
-YEAH.
-YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BE

21:35.590 --> 21:37.290
SEEN WITH ME?

21:37.290 --> 21:39.030
I MEAN, YOU MIGHT
GET LABELED SNITCH
BY PROXY.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.630
THIS--THIS
ISN'T FUNNY.

21:40.630 --> 21:42.400
YO. IT AIN'T LIKE ME
TURNING TYRONE IN

21:42.400 --> 21:44.360
WAS TO SAVE MY ASS
FROM PRISON
OR SOMETHING, OK?

21:44.360 --> 21:46.930
I WAS SAVING LIVES.
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.400
YOU SHOULD TAKE
THIS SERIOUSLY.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.100
MY UNCLE FLIP SAID
IT AIN'T ALL GOOD
IN THE STREETS.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.610
FOLKS SAYING YOU
SET TYRONE UP.

21:53.610 --> 21:54.910
I'M JUST SAYING.
I'LL SEE YOU.

21:54.910 --> 21:57.040
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.950
-SEE?
-NO, I DON'T.

21:58.950 --> 22:01.250
THERE'S A LEGIT REASON
THEY SAY, "SNITCHES
GET STITCHES."

22:01.250 --> 22:02.850
-COME ON.
-THERE'S A LEGIT REASON PEOPLE

22:02.850 --> 22:04.820
DON'T SAY THAT
ANYMORE.

22:07.220 --> 22:08.820
WOW.

22:52.430 --> 22:56.000
MAN: HEY! LET'S GO!

22:56.000 --> 22:58.470
LET'S GET IT!
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET IT!

23:01.240 --> 23:03.840
MAN: YO, YO, YO, YO!

THE SCHOOL RECEIVED

THAT YOU'RE NOT LIVING
IN THE PROPER ZIP CODE

24:14.510 --> 24:16.880
THEY PLAN ON DOING
A SPONTANEOUS CHECK-IN
TOMORROW TO MAKE SURE

24:16.880 --> 24:20.390
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE
ACTUALLY LIVING
AT THE BAKER HOUSE.

24:20.390 --> 24:22.490
YOU CAN THANK
MY DAD FOR THAT.

24:22.490 --> 24:23.920

ALL RIGHT. SO
HYPOTHETICALLY,
WHAT HAPPENS

24:27.530 --> 24:28.830

YOU'RE RULED INELIGIBLE
TO ATTEND BEVERLY

24:31.030 --> 24:32.670

24:32.670 --> 24:34.500
AND THAT WILL BE
RETROACTIVE
ALL THE WAY

24:34.500 --> 24:37.140

24:37.140 --> 24:39.040

SPENCER: I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY

24:51.050 --> 24:52.550
IT'S GOT TO BE SO HARD.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.390
I AIN'T
BOTHERING NOBODY.

24:54.390 --> 24:56.420
WHY'S ANYONE CARE
WHERE I SLEEP?

24:56.420 --> 24:59.430
SOMETIMES, THAT'S
JUST LIFE, BABY,

24:59.430 --> 25:01.590
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE GIVE UP.

26:02.350 --> 26:03.660
COOP: NOW YOU JUST
TALKING STUPID.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.590
BAKERS WOULD STILL
BE TOGETHER,

26:05.590 --> 26:07.390
AND THE EAGLES WOULDN'T
BE IN DANGER OF LOSING
THEIR TITLE.

26:07.390 --> 26:09.660
AND YOUR COUCH WOULD
HAVE STILL CHEATED
ON HIS WIFE,

26:09.660 --> 26:12.500
AND THE EAGLES PROBABLY
WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE MADE
IT TO THE PLAYOFFS.

26:12.500 --> 26:16.770
LOOK. BEVERLY HILLS
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT
BUT NOT BETTER.

26:16.770 --> 26:18.900
ANYWAY, THAT'S
WHATEVER NOW.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.670
HOW DID COACH BAKER
REACT TO YOU PLAYING
FOR YOUR POPS IN THE FALL?

26:21.670 --> 26:23.110
I DIDN'T TELL HIM YET.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.410
COOP: SO YOU AIN'T
TELL HIM,

26:24.410 --> 26:26.110
YOU DIDN'T TELL
YOUR POP.

26:26.110 --> 26:27.610
I'M SAYING MAYBE
YOU REALIZING
BEVERLY HILLS

26:27.610 --> 26:29.550
AIN'T JUST SOME
RANDOM BOUGIE PLACE

26:29.550 --> 26:31.380
YOU CAN SHOOT YOUR SHOT
AT NO MORE.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.520
THOSE ARE PEOPLE YOU LOVE,
A TEAM YOU LOVE,

26:33.520 --> 26:34.920
INCLUDING COACH.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.360
PATIENCE: BABE, YOU SURE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE HERE?

26:37.360 --> 26:39.360
IF YOU LAY LOW FOR
A SEC, ALL THIS TYRONE
MESS SHOULD BLOW OVER.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.990
SPENCER: HOLD ON.
WHAT THE HELL
THEY TALKING ABOUT?

26:40.990 --> 26:42.700
YO. Y'ALL GOT
BIG MOUTHS,
YOU KNOW THAT?

26:42.700 --> 26:45.430
YEAH? WELL, SOMEONE LEFT
A THREAT ON COOP'S LOCKER

26:45.430 --> 26:47.400
AFTER WHAT SHE DID
TO TYRONE, SO...

26:47.400 --> 26:48.800
WHY IS THIS THE FIRST
I'M HEARING ABOUT THIS?

26:48.800 --> 26:50.400
THAT'S WHY.
LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.900
I DON'T NEED YOU
GOING ALL CRAZY

26:51.900 --> 26:53.370
TRYING TO PROTECT ME,

26:53.370 --> 26:56.080
AND AIN'T NOBODY
GONNA RUN ME
INTO HIDING, OK?

26:56.080 --> 26:57.510
LOOK AT THIS PLACE--

26:57.510 --> 26:59.880
BLOODS, CRIPS,
CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.410
EVERYBODY CAME TO
PAY THEIR RESPECT
TO NIPSEY,

27:02.410 --> 27:04.380
AND I'MA DO
THE SAME THING.

27:06.390 --> 27:07.750
TRIPPING.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.290
PATIENCE: YEAH. OK.

27:16.560 --> 27:19.470
YOU OK?

27:19.470 --> 27:22.000
WOW. THAT'S
A GOOD SCENT FOR YOU.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.440
WHAT IS THAT,
EAU DE BOURBON?

27:24.440 --> 27:26.840
OK. BE CAREFUL.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.110
OR WHAT, DAD?
YOU'LL RESIGN

27:29.110 --> 27:31.340
FROM BEING
MY FATHER, TOO?

27:31.340 --> 27:34.410
OH, WAIT. YOU KIND OF
ALREADY DID THAT.

27:34.410 --> 27:36.720
-WHAT'S THIS?
-I TOOK YOUR DAMN LETTER.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.120
WHY? WHY?

27:38.120 --> 27:39.650
I CAME BY YOUR OFFICE
THAT NIGHT TO SEE YOU

27:39.650 --> 27:41.520
AFTER LEAVING CHRIS
AT THE HOSPITAL,

27:41.520 --> 27:43.420
AND I FOUND IT
ON YOUR DESK.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.460
-OK.
-HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU TOLD US

27:45.460 --> 27:47.790
NOT TO MAKE
LIFE-CHANGING DECISIONS

27:47.790 --> 27:49.060
WHEN WE'RE
CRAZY EMOTIONAL,

27:49.060 --> 27:50.930
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DID.

27:50.930 --> 27:53.000
SO YOU TOOK THE LETTER
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
ME TO WHAT,

27:53.000 --> 27:54.830
LIKE, CHANGE MY MIND
OR SOMETHING?

27:54.830 --> 27:57.640
HOPING TO GIVE YOU TIME
TO COME TO YOUR SENSES.

27:59.940 --> 28:01.610
THAT'S WHY I PRETENDED
TO BE YOU,

28:01.610 --> 28:04.310
AND I E-MAILED
PRINCIPAL LANDON
ABOUT THE EXTRA VACATION.

28:04.310 --> 28:06.050
-WHAT?!
-EVERYONE IS GIVING UP

28:06.050 --> 28:09.450
ON THIS FAMILY,
AND I REFUSE TO DO THAT.

28:09.450 --> 28:11.080
I'M NOT GIVING UP
ON THIS FAMILY.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.750
REALLY? SO YOU HIDING
IN CRENSHAW,

28:12.750 --> 28:15.390
PRETENDING TO REBUILD
AND DRINKING LIKE A FISH,

28:15.390 --> 28:17.620
THAT'S YOU FIGHTING
FOR OUR FAMILY?

28:17.620 --> 28:20.430
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES,

28:20.430 --> 28:23.330
BUT WE CAN'T LET THEM
DEFINE US.

28:23.330 --> 28:26.670
I MEAN, YOU TAUGHT
ME THAT,

28:26.670 --> 28:28.430
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:28.430 --> 28:31.970
IF YOU'RE TOTALLY SET
ON MAINTAINING
THE STATUS QUO

28:31.970 --> 28:34.570
AND QUITTING
ON ALL OF US,

28:34.570 --> 28:36.640
THEN, YEAH,

28:36.640 --> 28:39.350
MAYBE WE ARE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT YOU.

28:48.820 --> 28:51.990
FLIP: IT'S FUNNY HOW FOLK LOOK
AT OUR YOUNG BLACK BOYS,

28:51.990 --> 28:53.730
OUR MEN.

28:53.730 --> 28:55.430
THEY DON'T SEE US.

28:55.430 --> 28:57.730
THEY SEE THEIR FEARS
AND THEIR PREJUDICES.

28:57.730 --> 28:59.730
SEE, NIPSEY WAS DIFFERENT.

28:59.730 --> 29:02.470
THE WHOLE WORLD COULDN'T HELP
BUT SEE HIS SHINING LIGHT.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.500
THAT'S WHY THEY GOT TEARS
FLOWING FROM HERE

29:04.500 --> 29:06.370
TO THE RED SEA.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.710
I'M SORRY YOUR POPS
IS MISSING THIS.

29:08.710 --> 29:10.440
YEAH. ME, TOO.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.340
TRUST ME, HE'D RATHER BE
HERE THAN SOME BOARD ROOM

29:12.340 --> 29:13.810
IN CULVER CITY.

29:13.810 --> 29:17.550
FLIP: HE PURSUED HIS DREAMS
OF MUSIC UNAPOLOGETIC.

29:17.550 --> 29:20.090
HE DID IT ALL
ON HIS TERMS.

29:20.090 --> 29:23.520
HE WASN'T JUST NO
HOMEBOY KICKING IT
IN NO NEIGHBORHOOD.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.360
HE WAS A PILLAR
OF THE COMMUNITY

29:25.360 --> 29:28.360
WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT
DEFEAT FROM THOSE FOLK

29:28.360 --> 29:31.560
WHO KEPT SAYING
OUR DREAMS WEREN'T REAL,

29:31.560 --> 29:33.570
LET ALONE VALID,

29:33.570 --> 29:36.540
THAT WE, TOO,
COULDN'T BE GREAT,

29:36.540 --> 29:38.440
AND, SEE, THAT'S WHAT
MOTIVATED NIP

29:38.440 --> 29:40.870
TO PROVE THEM HATERS WRONG,

29:40.870 --> 29:43.440
SO TRUST ME, MAN,
AND HEAR ME

29:43.440 --> 29:46.010
WHEN I SAY NIP IS
A REAL ONE--

29:46.010 --> 29:49.950
PHILANTHROPIST, INVESTOR,
AND ENTREPRENEUR,

29:49.950 --> 29:51.420
BUT MOST OF ALL,

29:51.420 --> 29:53.450
HE WAS A FATHER AND A SON,

29:53.450 --> 29:55.990
NOT JUST TO HIS FAMILY
BUT A FATHER AND A SON

29:55.990 --> 29:57.590
IN THIS COMMUNITY.

29:57.590 --> 30:00.690
Y'ALL DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS MAN, HE PROVED

30:00.690 --> 30:05.400
THAT YOU AIN'T GOT TO BE
BLOOD TO BE FAMILY.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.600
WE GOT TO KEEP INVESTING
IN OURSELVES,

30:07.600 --> 30:11.100
INVESTING IN THE COMMUNITIES,
IN EACH OTHER.

30:11.100 --> 30:15.770
THAT'S HOW WE KEEP OUR BROTHER
ERMIAS ASGHEDOM'S LEGACY ALIVE.

30:15.770 --> 30:19.810
THAT'S HOW
THE MARATHON CONTINUES.

30:19.810 --> 30:21.550
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

30:21.550 --> 30:24.380
PUT ONE IN THE AIR
FOR NIPSEY HUSSLE.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.640
CAN WE TALK?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.420
FOR WEEKS, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

30:59.420 --> 31:02.360
HOW TO SAY WHAT
NEEDED TO BE SAID
BETWEEN US,

31:02.360 --> 31:04.620
AND THE TRUTH IS
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY

31:04.620 --> 31:07.590
DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I WAS WRONG.

31:11.030 --> 31:14.970
IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU AT THE TIME.

31:14.970 --> 31:18.870
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN MY OWN LIFE.

31:18.870 --> 31:21.610
WHAT MATTERS IS I KNEW
BILLY WAS MARRIED,

31:21.610 --> 31:23.940
AND IN THAT MOMENT,
I SHOULD HAVE RESPECTED THAT

31:23.940 --> 31:25.410
AND WALKED AWAY.

31:25.410 --> 31:28.110
FOR THAT, I'M TRULY SORRY,

31:28.110 --> 31:30.880
AND EVEN MORE SO,
I'M...SORRY FOR MOVING

31:30.880 --> 31:33.990
MY SON INTO YOUR HOME
WITHOUT BEING FULLY
HONEST WITH YOU

31:33.990 --> 31:36.560
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

31:36.560 --> 31:39.990
I, UH--I'M NOT HERE
FOR FORGIVENESS.

31:39.990 --> 31:42.560
I JUST WANTED TO OWN
MY PART IN THIS

31:42.560 --> 31:44.600
AND ACCEPT MY BLAME.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.430
WHEN YOU'RE WRONG,
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

31:46.430 --> 31:49.400
TO MEET WITH SOMEONE
DIRECTLY,

31:49.400 --> 31:50.970
FACE TO FACE...

31:53.470 --> 31:55.870
SO THEY CAN SEE
THAT YOU MEAN IT.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.980
AND I TRULY DO.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.850
ARE YOU DONE?

32:16.860 --> 32:18.530
HA HA HA!

32:18.530 --> 32:20.400
COOP: HA HA HA!

32:20.400 --> 32:23.600
THE SISTER.

32:23.600 --> 32:24.970
WHAT UP, COOP?

32:24.970 --> 32:26.540
TRYING TO GET HOME,
THAT'S ALL.

32:26.540 --> 32:27.910
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

32:27.910 --> 32:29.440
YOU LOOSE-LIPPED BITCHES
RUNNING FREE

32:29.440 --> 32:30.540
TO SNITCH ON WHOEVER?

32:30.540 --> 32:31.940
YEAH, THAT'S A PROBLEM.

32:31.940 --> 32:34.050
YOU GOT A LOT OF NERVE
COMING OUT HERE, COOP.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.510
LISTEN. IF YOUR
UNGRATEFUL ASS
WANT TO JUMP ME

32:35.510 --> 32:37.320
FOR SAVING Y'ALL'S
DAMN LIVES,
YOU CAN TRY,

32:37.320 --> 32:39.880
BUT WHAT I'M NOT
GONNA DO IS APOLOGIZE

32:39.880 --> 32:41.920
FOR DEADING TYRONE'S
TRIGGER-HAPPY RAMPAGE.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.020
REALLY, HOW MANY MORE
BROTHERS DID TYRONE
HAVE TO KILL

32:44.020 --> 32:46.090
FOR IT TO BE COOL
FOR ME TO TURN HIM IN?

32:53.670 --> 32:56.200
PREACH: HEY! I KNOW
Y'ALL NOT ABOUT TO

32:56.200 --> 32:59.240
DISRESPECT HIS VIGIL
LIKE THAT.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.910
Y'ALL DIDN'T HEAR
A DAMN WORD FLIP
SAID TONIGHT.

33:01.910 --> 33:04.510
MAN, FALL BACK...NOW.

33:11.850 --> 33:13.990
YO. I HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.520
SEE, I LIVE BY
A DIFFERENT CODE
OUT HERE IN THESE STREETS,

33:16.520 --> 33:18.920
SO I HANDLE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY,

33:18.920 --> 33:21.230
BUT GET THAT YOU DID
WHAT YOU FELT YOU HAD TO DO

33:21.230 --> 33:24.100
TO STOP THE VIOLENCE.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.860
AIN'T NOBODY IN THE CREW
GONNA BOTHER YOU

33:25.860 --> 33:27.530
OR YOUR GIRL ANYMORE.

33:27.530 --> 33:29.030
YOU'RE FREE, COOP.

33:29.030 --> 33:30.940
JUST KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.280
YOU OK?

33:39.280 --> 33:41.950
YEAH, I'M GOOD.

33:41.950 --> 33:43.980

34:49.880 --> 34:53.050

34:53.050 --> 34:55.250
I CAME BACK TO MAKE
THINGS RIGHT WITH HIM

34:55.250 --> 34:59.260
AND POSSIBLY FIND MYSELF
AGAIN IN THE PROCESS.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.960
THAT MEANS SOME
TOUGH FACE-TO-FACE
CONVERSATIONS,

35:01.960 --> 35:06.870
AND CAN'T DO THAT

35:06.870 --> 35:10.970
OH. SPENCER TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR OFFER.

35:10.970 --> 35:13.240

35:13.240 --> 35:16.880
SO LET ME GUESS.
YOU GONNA FIGHT
TO KEEP HIM.

35:16.880 --> 35:21.450

SPENCER'S FAMILY.

35:21.450 --> 35:23.850
I JUST WANT WHAT'S
BEST FOR HIM.

35:23.850 --> 35:26.990
IF HE DECIDES TO
PLAY FOR YOU,
THEN SO BE IT.

35:26.990 --> 35:29.850

HI, SPENCER.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.510

36:01.850 --> 36:04.920
I REALIZED TODAY
THAT HIDING FROM MY PAIN

36:04.920 --> 36:08.360
DOESN'T MAKE IT
GO AWAY,

36:08.360 --> 36:12.530

36:16.870 --> 36:18.970
BILLY AND YOUR MOM

36:18.970 --> 36:21.510

36:21.510 --> 36:24.810
THE ONE THING WE CAN
ALL AGREE ON...

36:26.510 --> 36:28.910
IS HOW...

36:28.910 --> 36:30.880
HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.860
SOMETIMES...

36:41.860 --> 36:45.360
IT'S IMPORTANT TO SAY
WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY

36:45.360 --> 36:50.340
FACE TO FACE SO THAT
THE PERSON CAN SEE
THAT YOU REALLY MEAN IT,

36:50.340 --> 36:54.610
SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY,

36:54.610 --> 36:57.810

THE TRUTH.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.830
YOU DESERVE TO KNOW
IF DILLON IS YOUR
SON OR NOT.

38:22.830 --> 38:27.770
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH CASUALTIES.

38:33.340 --> 38:36.440
THAT'S WHY I THINK
WE SHOULD LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.210
-WHAT?
-IT WAS DIFFERENT

38:38.210 --> 38:41.280
WHEN I THOUGHT
THE TRUTH WAS
ALREADY OUT THERE,

38:41.280 --> 38:42.950
BUT IT'S NOT.

38:42.950 --> 38:45.020
LOOK. BLOOD
OR NO BLOOD,

38:45.020 --> 38:47.890
I LOVE DILLON
LIKE HE'S MY OWN,

38:47.890 --> 38:51.090
AND HE ALREADY THINKS
HE HAS HIS FATHER BACK.

38:51.090 --> 38:53.960
WHY SHOULD WE RISK
UPENDING ALL OF THAT?

38:57.500 --> 38:58.860
YOU'RE SERIOUS.
