00:11.000 --> 00:13.120
VICTORIA: How you doing?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.560
STEPHEN: Ah, good so far.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.760
VICTORIA: Great.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.320
STEPHEN: Oh,
I never tire of that view.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.320
You okay?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.400
Yeah, I'm good.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.800
You catch your breath.
I'll check the seismometer.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.520
Well, I can't find
anything wrong with it.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.160
Sensors are clean.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.960
Okay.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.200
Well, let's get back down.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.600
Ah, no signs of malfunction
as far as we can tell.

01:09.680 --> 01:13.000
Wait, so the seismic readings
we're getting are accurate?

01:13.080 --> 01:15.680
Well, we can't discount
extraneous factors, Daniel.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.680
Could just be a passing
animal setting it off.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.160
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.800
But if that isn't the case,

01:21.880 --> 01:24.880
it's three nights in a row
we've had amplitude signals

01:24.960 --> 01:27.320
at a level consistent
with low frequency unrest.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.080
We can't ignore that.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.600
If it is an animal,
the chances are
it's nocturnal.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.240
I'll go back up tonight.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.560
At least that way we'll know
for sure what's going on.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.160
Oh, you've only
just come back down.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.600
Well,
it's my turn on night duty.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.960
Might as well spend it
up there as down here.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.920
What time's the mayor
due tomorrow morning?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.400
Er, 9:30, isn't it?

01:45.480 --> 01:46.960
I'll be back for that.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.440
And I'll expect a decent
breakfast waiting for me.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.560
One a day. Can't hurt, can it?

02:00.640 --> 02:03.000
What happened to that paper
you wanted me to read?

02:03.080 --> 02:04.880
There's still a few things
I'd like to iron out.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.960
Then get them ironed out.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.360
Can't have my favourite
protege slacking.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.720
Your only protege you mean.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.840
Right.

02:14.520 --> 02:17.600
I better go email
the powers that be.

02:17.680 --> 02:20.160
Update them on
where we're at
with these readings.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.480
Thanks.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.400
One hour.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.080
Good morning, Victoria.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.920
Mayor Richards. Good morning.
Good to see you.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.760
Everything all right?

03:04.840 --> 03:06.480
You better come in.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.720
If you pick this up, Stephen,
please just give us a call.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.880
Let us know you're okay.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.840
What's going on?
We're not sure.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.000
Stephen camped out
on the volcano last night.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.320
He hasn't come
back this morning,
he's not answering his radio.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.440
I'm scrambling the helicopter.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.200
VICTORIA: Nothing this side.
Keep a look out.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.360
Daniel.
To the left, down there.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.200
Oh, no.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.320
Bring us in, down there.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.680
Stephen!

03:50.880 --> 03:51.880
Stephen!

03:54.120 --> 03:55.400
Stephen!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.280
He's dead.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.640
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:41.480 --> 04:43.640
Sir?

04:43.720 --> 04:45.600
HUMPHREY:
Okay, what's the
flight number?

04:45.680 --> 04:48.320
MARTHA: Oh, erm, ends in 630.
Do you know where
I'm coming from?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.120
Yes, Caracas.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.840
MARTHA: Have you ever been?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.720
HUMPHREY:
No, no I've never been.
MARTHA: You'd love it.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.160
HUMPHREY: Okay.
MARTHA: Can't wait to see you.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.240
What time are you arriving?

04:56.320 --> 04:57.360
MARTHA: 4:30.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.920
Perfect.
MARTHA: Don't forget.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.120
No, no, no, I won't forget.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.600
Morning, sir.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.400
Ah, Florence. Morning.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.720
Yes,
come and say hello to Martha.
She's in Venezuela.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.000
Martha, looks it's Florence.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.800
Oh,
hello, Florence, how are...

05:09.880 --> 05:11.200
Martha?

05:11.280 --> 05:14.360
Ma... Oh, dear.
She appears to have gone.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.480
Must've got disconnected.

05:17.560 --> 05:18.840
Why are you?

05:18.920 --> 05:20.400
Something seems to have
happened with my Wi-Fi.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.360
Can't seem to get any
sort of signal in the shack.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.000
But there, it's perfect.
It's very odd indeed.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.520
Anyway,
Martha's flying in tonight,

05:28.600 --> 05:31.560
so if I achieve
nothing else today,
I must get to the airport.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.280
On time. 6:30 sharp.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.680
Okay, but right now, we've got
something else to worry about.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.080
We've got a dead body
half way up a volcano.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.280
Really?

05:41.360 --> 05:43.120
Well,
this calls for some socks.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.720
Are we nearly there yet?
Oh, God.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.680
JP: Morning, sir. Sarge.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.040
HUMPHREY: Good morning, JP.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.440
Chief. The deceased
is Stephen Langham.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.400
Chief volcanologist at
the Saint Marie
Volcano Observatory.

05:57.480 --> 06:01.080
Found this morning by
his brother Daniel
and Victoria Baker.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.480
Both co-workers
at the observatory.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.400
He came up here
last night sometime

06:05.480 --> 06:07.280
after 9:00 PM to
check the seisometer.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.120
Seismometer I think, Dwayne.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.760
Er, yes, yes.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.120
Seems there'd been some
irregular
readings coming through.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.720
Now they were
expecting him back
this morning around 9:00 AM,

06:15.800 --> 06:17.040
but he never showed.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.200
Any clues as to
cause of death?

06:19.280 --> 06:21.520
The paramedics think
he died of natural causes.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.920
He had a history
of heart problems.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.240
Heart attack?

06:24.320 --> 06:25.600
Six months ago.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.280
No sign of any injuries
or any kind of struggle.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.960
JP: Yeah, poor guy.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.040
Dying up here in the middle
of the night, all alone.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.560
That's not a way to go, is it?

06:34.640 --> 06:36.160
Ah, no, JP. No, it is not.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.520
What time was sunset?

06:38.600 --> 06:39.760
Just after seven?

06:39.840 --> 06:41.560
And he
definitely walked up here?

06:41.640 --> 06:44.280
Yes, Chief.
There's no other way
to access the volcano.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.400
The terrain is way too rough.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.600
And that helicopter
is for emergency use only.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.560
What are you thinking, sir?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.480
Well, what's missing?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.000
A torch.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.720
There's everything
else you'd expect

07:01.800 --> 07:04.040
a man camping out
on a volcano to
carry with him.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.840
A tent.
Binoculars. Walkie-talkie.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.560
Mobile.
Sandwiches. Water canteen.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.360
Now you said he came up here
around 9:00 PM
yesterday evening,

07:13.440 --> 07:15.920
which would've been dark,
and yet there's no torch.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.440
Which is odd, don't you think?

07:20.360 --> 07:22.800
Dwayne. JP. Release the body.
Bag this little lot.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.560
And once you've done that,
I'd like you to trace

07:24.640 --> 07:26.320
Mr Langham's route
back to the observatory.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.600
See if you can
find any evidence
of a dropped torch.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.720
Yes, Chief, we're on it.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.200
JP, come.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.760
Florence, let's go and speak
to his colleagues.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.480
I'd like to know
a little more about

07:34.560 --> 07:36.760
Stephen Langham's
movements last night.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.520
Come along. Oh, dear.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.680
Inspector Goodman.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.160
Joseph Richards.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.680
HUMPHREY: Ah, Mayor Richards.
Yes, we've met.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.160
Sorry,
we were briefly introduced

07:53.240 --> 07:55.080
at a council drinks evening,
a few months ago.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.440
We were?

07:56.520 --> 07:59.160
Er, yes. We, er, we talked
about cricket.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.640
The, er, 2012
West Indies tour if I recall.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.720
You know it,
er, it rained a lot,

08:03.800 --> 08:05.400
Andrew Strauss got a century
in the first test.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.080
And in the second he, er...

08:08.160 --> 08:09.120
Ah.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.880
I'm sorry,
you're here because?

08:11.960 --> 08:14.080
I flew in from
Guadeloupe this morning

08:14.160 --> 08:17.640
to meet with Stephen,
to discuss funding
for the observatory.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.400
I see.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.880
Hello, er, we appreciate
this must be
a hard time for you.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.800
If you wouldn't
mind telling me
who you all are.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.760
Victoria Baker.
I'm the resident

08:26.840 --> 08:28.720
geophysicist here.
(VOICE TREMBLING)

08:28.800 --> 08:29.920
Sorry.

08:31.240 --> 08:32.600
Er, yes, we understand.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.280
Megan Colley.
Junior Geologist.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.360
You must be Daniel Langham,
I presume?

08:38.440 --> 08:40.640
Yes, I'm a volcanologist here.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.960
And you're Stephen's brother?

08:42.040 --> 08:44.040
Yes, that's right.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.160
I understand
Stephen was on the volcano
to check your equipment there.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.800
The seismograph's been showing
irregular output
these last few nights.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.960
He wanted to
check the readings
weren't being corrupted.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.920
Corrupted?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.440
Seismometers can
unintentionally
pick up movement from animals,

08:57.520 --> 08:59.320
or even the weather sometimes.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.280
So he decided to
go up there himself
to monitor it?

09:02.360 --> 09:04.360
It was his turn on night duty.

09:04.440 --> 09:07.080
HUMPHREY:
And he left at about 9:00 PM?

09:07.160 --> 09:08.480
If you wanna check, Inspector,

09:08.560 --> 09:10.200
there's a CCTV camera
in the control room.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.040
I'm sure that will show you
when Stephen left.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.520
Is there CCTV anywhere else?
Any other security?

09:15.600 --> 09:16.840
There's the swipe system.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.160
Swipe?

09:18.240 --> 09:19.760
On the door.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.000
Logs everyone who goes
in and out of the observatory.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.600
We all have individual cards

09:24.680 --> 09:27.440
to make sure
everyone's accounted for
in case of an eruption.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.520
Erm,
if you intended to head up

09:29.600 --> 09:31.520
the volcano at night,
in the dark,

09:31.600 --> 09:33.680
I assume you'd
need to take a torch?

09:34.360 --> 09:35.720
Of course.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.160
You have to make
your way through

09:37.240 --> 09:39.120
some pretty dense
jungle up there.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.640
It just appears that Stephen
didn't have one with him.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.440
But he, he must've done.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.640
My thought exactly.
But yet, he didn't.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.640
Where do you keep
your torches here?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.280
By the main entrance.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.040
There isn't one missing?

10:00.120 --> 10:01.120
No. (SNIFFS)

10:01.200 --> 10:02.960
Are you all right?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.000
Touch of flu.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.880
Er, could I
trouble you for the, erm,
CCTV and the swipe card log?

10:08.960 --> 10:11.400
Of course.
HUMPHREY: Thanks.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.320
So when he left
the observatory last night,

10:13.400 --> 10:16.320
Stephen would've exited
through that door.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.000
Passing right
by these torches.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.760
Maybe he forgot to take one?

10:19.840 --> 10:21.360
It was already dark, Florence.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.560
And on stepping outside
and realising that,

10:23.640 --> 10:25.280
all he had to do was
step back in
again and get one.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.200
So what are you saying, sir?

10:27.280 --> 10:28.680
I just don't
believe that our victim

10:28.760 --> 10:30.120
would walk just over
a mile-long journey

10:30.200 --> 10:32.440
up a volcano in pitch black
without a torch.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.960
You think it was
taken from the scene?

10:35.040 --> 10:36.640
Possibly.
But if that is the case,

10:36.720 --> 10:38.400
then someone must've
been up there with him.

10:38.480 --> 10:42.880
So, erm, Stephen left
the observatory at 9:06 PM.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.560
I didn't check the CCTV,
but I'm sure it'll tally.

10:45.640 --> 10:46.640
Okay.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.680
So according to this

10:49.760 --> 10:51.840
after Stephen left at
six minutes past
nine last night,

10:51.920 --> 10:53.840
the next person to
swipe the door open

10:53.920 --> 10:56.240
was Victoria Baker
at 9:28 this morning?

10:56.320 --> 10:58.040
That's right.
When the Mayor arrived.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.520
Is there anything else?

11:02.600 --> 11:04.040
No, thank you.

11:06.200 --> 11:10.080
So no-one exited or entered
this building
between Stephen leaving

11:10.160 --> 11:12.080
and Mayor Richards
arriving this morning?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.520
Which means if
someone did go up
that volcano with Stephen,

11:14.600 --> 11:16.880
and then travelled
back with the torch...

11:16.960 --> 11:18.880
How did they get
back in the observatory?

11:18.960 --> 11:20.760
Yes. Quite.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.360
HUMPHREY: Exclusion zone.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.520
I assume that's the bit that
no one's allowed into,

11:28.600 --> 11:30.160
in case there's
ever an eruption.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.920
It's been over 80 years
since Mount Esmee last erupted

11:33.000 --> 11:34.960
but she's
officially still active.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.200
So I've just been up
an actual real live volcano?

11:39.280 --> 11:40.840
That's excellent.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.760
Ah, phenolphthalein.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.880
That rings a very distant
GCSE chemistry bell.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.560
Er, used for
testing soil acidity,
if I remember rightly.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.360
Turns pink when
an acid is added.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.240
Or, or is it blue?

11:55.320 --> 11:58.280
Mr Langham was definitely
what you would call

11:58.360 --> 12:01.200
a creature of habit.
Is that how you say it?

12:01.280 --> 12:03.280
That's exactly how
you say it, Florence.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.160
There's not much
variety here is there?

12:06.240 --> 12:09.600
Guess you're right.
Il aime son train-train,
la routine.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.840
Very good, sir.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.520
Chief?
HUMPHREY: Yes?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.480
The body's on the way
to the pathologist.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.320
And we've loaded
all the evidence
from the scene into the jeep.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.520
Excellent, Dwayne.
We, er,
should also bag his laptop,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.640
personal documents,
correspondence.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.320
How'd you get on
with the walk back,
any sign of a torch?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.520
I'm afraid not, sir.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.000
Someone was up that volcano
with Stephen
Langham last night,

12:28.080 --> 12:30.320
Florence I'm sure of it.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.240
And now they're
lying to cover it up.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.200
Are you saying you think
they might've
killed him, Chief?

12:34.280 --> 12:36.800
I'm saying it's suspicious,
at the very least, Dwayne.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.120
And we should
treat it as such.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.280
But there were no signs
of injury or assault.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.440
And you can't murder someone
with a heart attack.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.360
No, no, you can't.
You're quite right, Florence.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.680
I guess we'll
have to wait and see

12:46.760 --> 12:48.640
what the post
mortem brings up, eh?

12:50.720 --> 12:52.280
All this because
of a missing torch?

12:52.360 --> 12:53.440
Mmm.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.200
HUMPHREY: Hmm.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.200
SELWYN: Hat?
JUSTINE: Yeah.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.920
So.
JUSTINE: Yeah.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.600
Yeah, really nice!

13:18.680 --> 13:20.200
SELWYN:
Shall I come towards you?
JUSTINE: Yeah.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.480
Ah.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.400
JUSTINE: Amazing.

13:23.480 --> 13:27.440
Let me introduce
Justine Tremblay
from the Saint Marie Times.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.560
Hello!

13:28.640 --> 13:29.760
Hello.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.840
Morning, Justine.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.400
They're insisting
on doing a feature

13:33.480 --> 13:35.120
about me for
the weekend edition.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.800
So I thought I'd show her

13:36.880 --> 13:40.000
the Caribbean's finest team
of law enforcement officers.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.800
The Commissioner
is being incredibly
generous with his time.

13:42.880 --> 13:44.440
Well, I'm sure he is.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.840
Inspector. I wonder if I might
have a word in your ear.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.160
If you can spare me
for a few minutes?

13:49.240 --> 13:50.320
Sure.

13:55.280 --> 13:58.200
This business up at
the Volcano Observatory.

13:58.280 --> 13:59.840
Yes, early days, sir.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.040
Stephen Langham appears
to have died of natural causes

14:02.120 --> 14:04.560
but there are
one or two things
that don't quite add up, sir.

14:04.640 --> 14:09.560
I believe Mayor Richards
was in
attendance this morning?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.600
Yes, sir. Yes, he was.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.800
Then can I ask,
are you treating him
with suspicion at this stage?

14:14.880 --> 14:17.080
No, sir. Quite the contrary.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.760
He wasn't even on the island
last night when
the death occurred, sir.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.040
He was in Guadeloupe.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.280
Mayor Richards
likes to present himself

14:23.360 --> 14:25.440
as a caring and
well-meaning politician,

14:25.520 --> 14:27.000
man of the people.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.600
But I've known him a long time

14:28.680 --> 14:31.520
and I wouldn't trust him
as far as I could throw him.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.520
If any kind of
foul play's involved,

14:33.600 --> 14:36.000
I'd advise you not
to rule out that, er,

14:36.080 --> 14:38.280
Mayor Richards is
connected in some way.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.160
We'll keep an eye on him.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.480
Justine.
My apologies. I'm all yours.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.320
I notice it's lunchtime.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.680
How are you with seafood?

14:46.760 --> 14:47.880
Great.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.560
JP:
So, sir, at 8:47 last night,

14:51.640 --> 14:53.440
Stephen comes into
the control room.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.400
He packs some
things into his bag.

14:55.480 --> 14:59.480
Talks to Victoria Baker
and heads out at
five minutes past nine.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.840
Which corresponds
with the entry system

15:01.920 --> 15:04.120
that shows he
swiped out at 9:06 PM.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.680
It also shows no-one went out
or came in the whole night,

15:07.760 --> 15:09.800
until Victoria
Baker opened the door

15:09.880 --> 15:11.840
to Mayor Richards
at 9:28 this morning.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.400
(PHONE RINGS)
Er, excuse me.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.200
So, the victim.
Stephen Langham.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.200
55.
Found dead on Mount
Esmee this morning.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.680
Paramedics at
the scene concluded
he died of a heart failure,

15:22.760 --> 15:25.640
consistent with a heart attack
he suffered six months ago.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.720
Natural causes.
Thank you, Dwayne.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.520
Just saying, Chief.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.400
Mr Langham was
the Chief Volcanologist

15:31.480 --> 15:33.240
at the Saint
Marie Observatory.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.000
Has been working there
for the last 15 years.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.120
So, let us for
a moment consider that,

15:38.200 --> 15:40.520
er, Stephen's death may
not of been natural causes.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.880
Who might our suspects be?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.360
Megan Colley.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.840
22. From Dublin.

15:45.920 --> 15:47.680
Got a First in Geology.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.840
On a 12-month internship
at the observatory.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.240
Started six months ago.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.160
Although, an initial check
with immigration

15:53.240 --> 15:55.680
showed no record
of her arrival on the island.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.240
JP's put a call into the Irish
Passport Office
to look into it.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.920
Next.
Victoria Baker.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
Clearly upset by
Stephen's death.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.240
Seemed a rather fragile thing.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.160
Hmm. Miss Baker's
had a very
successful academic career.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.800
Got her professorship

16:08.880 --> 16:11.280
from the Munich Institute
of Physics and Technology...

16:11.360 --> 16:14.720
Good for her.
And finally, Daniel Langham.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.960
53. Stephen's
only close relative.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.440
Also a volcanologist.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.880
Yes, and not exactly
a picture of health himself.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.320
This is interesting.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.160
Academic star at University,

16:25.240 --> 16:27.760
shot straight into
a prestigious
research position

16:27.840 --> 16:29.240
but somewhat
went off the radar.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.640
Mmm.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.040
Patchy employment history.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.240
Joined Stephen on the island
one year ago.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.640
Bit of a motley crew,
aren't they?

16:37.720 --> 16:40.160
Ah, we should also look into,
er, Mayor Richards.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.160
But he wasn't even
on the island last night.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.520
Yes, I know. I had a tip off.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.960
The Commissioner
suggested that we

16:48.040 --> 16:49.440
don't entirely
discount the Mayor.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.320
I bet he did.
Those two have never got on.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.760
Any reason why?

16:53.840 --> 16:55.760
Two peacocks in the same pen.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.640
This is a small island
and those are two big egos.

16:58.720 --> 17:00.760
Hmm, well, let's do
as the Commissioner suggested

17:00.840 --> 17:03.960
and check that he was,
as he claims,
in Guadeloupe last night.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.360
Thank you very much.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.760
I'll get on it, Chief.

17:06.840 --> 17:07.960
Sir?
Yes.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.160
I think you need to hear this.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.560
What have you got?

17:10.640 --> 17:12.360
So according to
the Irish Passport Office,

17:12.440 --> 17:14.960
Megan Colley isn't
here on Saint Marie.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.600
So where is she?

17:16.680 --> 17:18.960
On a six-months
work visa in China.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.200
China?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.000
So who's the girl we met
in the observatory?

17:27.600 --> 17:29.720
You know,
she did seem
conspicuously quiet

17:29.800 --> 17:31.560
when we were questioning
everyone earlier, Florence.

17:31.640 --> 17:32.920
Megan Colley?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.560
Yes.
Or whatever her real name is.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.080
It's actually Emer.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.400
My name's Emer Byrne.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.280
I knew you'd find out, so...

17:46.800 --> 17:47.960
Please.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.720
So why are you
pretending to be
someone else, Miss Byrne?

17:53.800 --> 17:56.920
Megan was my
best friend at uni.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.840
We lived together,
did everything together.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.040
Apart from graduate.

18:03.120 --> 18:07.600
She got a first and then I...
I failed.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.720
So how did you end up here?

18:09.800 --> 18:12.000
I'd lied to my parents.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.440
Couldn't tell them the truth.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.280
They'd spent their savings
to send me to uni.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.160
I didn't know what to do.
And then...

18:18.240 --> 18:20.000
Please. Sit there.

18:20.080 --> 18:25.440
I saw an advert
online for an internship
here at the observatory.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.200
I don't know what came over me
but I thought

18:28.280 --> 18:30.840
finally, here's my chance.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.240
So you applied.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.880
As Megan Colley?

18:33.960 --> 18:37.400
I sent her degree,
her results.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.280
And then all you had to do is
travel on your own passport

18:40.360 --> 18:42.200
and pretend to be her.

18:42.280 --> 18:47.040
I don't know
what I was thinking.
I mean... I wasn't thinking.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.600
Who at the observatory
knows about this?

18:50.200 --> 18:51.240
No-one.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.760
Did Stephen?

18:52.840 --> 18:53.840
No.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.320
You liked him, didn't you?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.880
He sort of took
me under his wing.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.320
Called me his protege.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.720
If Stephen had
found out the truth,

19:02.800 --> 19:05.360
that you weren't
who you said you were,

19:05.440 --> 19:07.280
how would you have stopped
him from reporting you?

19:07.360 --> 19:09.520
I don't know.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.240
But I could never have
done anything to hurt him.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.040
What do you think, sir?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.040
Well, I'm not sure, Florence.

19:24.120 --> 19:28.000
I think she
genuinely cared for Stephen.
That much is clear.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.120
But something's
not quite right.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.040
Like she's not telling us
the whole truth.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.240
DWAYNE:
Ah, yes, thank you very much.

19:41.320 --> 19:42.600
Okay, Chief.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.320
So I checked and
Mayor Richards stayed

19:44.400 --> 19:46.760
at the Blue Orchid Hotel
in Guadeloupe last night.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.520
Air Caribbean confirmed
he boarded the first flight

19:49.600 --> 19:51.080
back to Saint
Marie this morning.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.040
Oh, well, there's no arguing
with that, I suppose.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.880
I also spoke to
the Mayor's secretary.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.680
She said that Mr
Richards and the victim

19:56.760 --> 19:58.360
did cross paths
from time to time.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.440
Very much
a working relationship,
from what I can gather.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.880
Yes, yes, good, good.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.160
I'll update the Commissioner
in the morning.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.080
And, er,
how are you getting on, JP?

20:05.160 --> 20:07.080
Well,
I've been working through

20:07.160 --> 20:09.000
Mr Langham's email
account on his laptop

20:09.080 --> 20:12.160
and er, there's
a lot of correspondence
that I don't understand,

20:12.240 --> 20:13.440
if I'm to be honest with you.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.640
But there was something
that caught my eye.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.560
Oh, yes?

20:17.640 --> 20:19.680
Yes,
about a week ago, a Dr Klein
at the Carrington Institute

20:19.760 --> 20:22.240
in London,
emailed Stephen Langham.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.880
"Stephen.
I've just read Baker's paper

20:24.960 --> 20:27.760
"and am slightly
taken aback by it.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.800
"Don't tell me
you're happy about this?
Can we talk?"

20:30.880 --> 20:32.480
Er,
Victoria Baker, I, I assume?

20:32.560 --> 20:35.200
I tried calling
the Institute to
talk to Dr Klein

20:35.280 --> 20:38.760
but it was gone
10:00 PM, UK time
and everybody had gone home.

20:38.840 --> 20:39.880
I'll try again in the morning.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.720
Er, yes, good, good.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.080
Well, I suggest we follow
the Carrington
Institute's lead

20:44.160 --> 20:45.840
and, er,
and call it a day ourselves.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.520
I need to get to the airport.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.840
Going to meet your girlfriend,
eh, Chief?

20:48.920 --> 20:50.280
Er, what?

20:50.360 --> 20:52.720
No, I mean...
Well, she's not a girlfriend.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.480
She's a, just a friend
who, er, who is a...

20:58.280 --> 20:59.400
A girl?

21:00.600 --> 21:01.800
I'd better get to the airport.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.200
Oh, hello, Florence.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.560
Martha?

21:22.520 --> 21:24.000
Erm,
Humphrey was supposed to be

21:24.080 --> 21:25.520
picking me up
from the airport.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.720
But he didn't show
and his phone's switched off.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.840
You just missed him.
Oh.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.600
He got the time wrong,
didn't he?

21:31.680 --> 21:33.400
It looks that way.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.200
He said 6:30?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.920
That was my flight number.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.040
Oh.

21:39.120 --> 21:40.960
Probably to be expected.
(LAUGHS)

21:46.120 --> 21:49.000
Welcome back to
Saint Marie, Martha.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.320
It's lovely to see you again.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.840
Ah, thank you, Catherine.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.120
It's lovely to be back.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.600
When you're ready
to see your room,

21:54.680 --> 21:56.640
just let me know
and I'll show you where it is.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.760
Thank you.

21:57.840 --> 21:59.360
In the meantime. Enjoy.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.680
These are on the house.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.400
So how long are you here for?

22:05.480 --> 22:07.160
Only a month sadly.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.760
Four weeks and then
it's back to reality.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.960
You'll have to make
the most of
your time together.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.680
We will,
when he finally turns up!

22:14.760 --> 22:16.520
(BOTH LAUGHING)

22:16.600 --> 22:17.800
(WHISTLING)

22:20.360 --> 22:21.360
Hi.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.280
Oh. Justine.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.680
I think I left my
camera bag here.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.040
Well, let's see
if we can find it, shall we?

22:30.120 --> 22:31.760
Sorry,
I never caught your name.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.560
Officer Myers.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.920
I'm
the longest-serving officer
here at the station.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.600
But call me Dwayne.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.000
Oh.

22:41.480 --> 22:42.640
Might this be it?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.120
Thank you.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.600
I wasn't sure where I left it.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.400
It's been quite
an exhausting day.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.920
Mmm, yes, I bet.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.280
You find the Commissioner
can be a bit exhausting too?

22:53.360 --> 22:55.960
Well, let me put it
this way, Justine...

22:57.440 --> 22:58.960
This is off the record, right?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.360
Of course.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.000
Now, my grandmother
had a big bossy goat.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.720
We used to call it "King Goat"

23:04.800 --> 23:06.320
because no matter
what you were
doing on the farm,

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
he was always
sticking his nose

23:08.480 --> 23:10.400
into things and
shoving himself about

23:10.480 --> 23:13.280
and always trying
to get in on the action.

23:13.360 --> 23:18.040
So the Commissioner is like
your grandmother's old goat?

23:18.120 --> 23:20.400
That's exactly what he's like.

23:24.680 --> 23:25.680
(CAR HORN HONKS)

23:25.760 --> 23:27.360
Oh
HUMPHREY: Martha!

23:30.360 --> 23:33.520
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.720
I couldn't find
you at the airport
and I was going to call,

23:35.800 --> 23:37.600
but that's when I realised
I'd left my phone in the jeep

23:37.680 --> 23:39.480
and I went to
get it, I couldn't
remember where I'd parked.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.640
Suffice to say, it's all been
a bit of a disaster my...

23:41.720 --> 23:43.040
Hello. (GIGGLES)

23:43.920 --> 23:45.040
Hello.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.320
Back to you.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.880
So how are you?
Oh, I'm good.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.440
Erm, well, I'm a bit tired.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.600
I think maybe the flight's
caught up with me.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.000
Erm, Catherine was just
about to take me to my room.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.720
But maybe
Humphrey can show you.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.000
Gosh,
yes, the least I could do.

24:03.080 --> 24:05.960
Erm, let me help
you with your bags.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.200
So lovely to see you both.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.880
And you.

24:08.960 --> 24:10.320
Goodnight, Martha.
Goodnight.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.600
HUMPHREY: Hi.
Hi.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.040
HUMPHREY:
So I was thinking maybe

24:17.120 --> 24:18.360
I could cook you
for dinner tomorrow?

24:18.440 --> 24:19.800
(GIGGLES)

24:19.880 --> 24:21.320
Sorry I mean,
cook dinner for you tomorrow?

24:21.400 --> 24:22.920
Obviously, I'm not a cannibal.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.800
Er, me neither.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.240
That would be wonderful.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.880
Great. Here we are.

24:32.440 --> 24:33.440
Thank you.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.200
Shall we say eight?
Great.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.680
Okay.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.000
Okay, then.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.840
Night.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.360
(GIGGLES)

25:01.320 --> 25:02.440
Idiot!

25:12.240 --> 25:14.520
And that's all he said to you?

25:15.520 --> 25:17.040
Morning, Sarge. JP.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.400
Morning, Dwayne.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.280
Thank you very much
for speaking to me.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.760
You've been very helpful.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.200
I thought you'd
like a coffee, Dwayne.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.080
So I put one on your desk.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.040
Oh,
thank you very much, Sarge.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.720
Have you seen this?

25:34.800 --> 25:37.240
Has the Commissioner
seen this?

25:37.320 --> 25:39.120
This is not good.
This is not good

25:39.200 --> 25:40.920
at all, at all, at all.
Oh, my!

25:41.000 --> 25:42.680
Morning, sir.
Er, morning, Florence.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.080
Morning, Chief.
JP.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.280
Dwayne.
Hey, Chief.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.440
Everything all right, sir?

25:46.520 --> 25:47.840
Er, pathology report.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.040
And?

25:49.120 --> 25:50.520
Well,
the speculative diagnosis,

25:50.600 --> 25:52.160
based on the fact
that Stephen Langham

25:52.240 --> 25:53.720
had a heart
attack six months ago,

25:53.800 --> 25:55.280
is that he died
of heart failure.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.600
So it was natural causes?

25:56.680 --> 25:58.520
Not necessarily, Dwayne.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.360
There is no actual
evidence of a further

26:00.440 --> 26:02.120
heart attack having
occurred yesterday.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.760
No clot, no scarring.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.560
So he didn't die
of a heart attack?

26:05.640 --> 26:07.280
Well, we can't
know for definite, JP.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.920
Technically the cause
of death is hypoxia.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.440
Hypoxia?

26:11.520 --> 26:13.040
Yes.
In layman's terms,
he ran out of air.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.640
Which means?

26:14.720 --> 26:16.560
Which means it could be
that his ticker's packed up

26:16.640 --> 26:19.280
or, in theory,
he could have been murdered.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.600
But how?

26:21.680 --> 26:23.560
Well,
he could've been smothered...

26:23.640 --> 26:25.720
But wouldn't
there have been signs
of that in the post mortem?

26:25.800 --> 26:28.640
There would.
And there weren't.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.560
Well, then, if the pathologist
can't find any evidence

26:31.640 --> 26:33.800
to indicate Stephen Langham
was murdered,

26:33.880 --> 26:36.280
surely that means he wasn't.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.840
Yes, I know.
Everything is pointing
to death by natural causes.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.920
If it wasn't for
that blasted torch.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.960
You see the question remains.

26:44.040 --> 26:48.440
Why did Stephen Langham appear
to set out on a mile-long walk

26:48.520 --> 26:51.400
up treacherous terrain in
the pitch black
without a torch?

26:52.520 --> 26:54.720
So, er, what have we got?

26:54.800 --> 26:56.600
Erm, any joy with
financial checks?

26:56.680 --> 26:57.880
Well, Chief.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.160
I've been through
both the victim's

26:59.240 --> 27:00.600
and the suspects'
financial records.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.480
Seems none of them
are exactly rolling in it.

27:02.560 --> 27:06.080
Now Daniel
Langham's the only one
who's actually in the red.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.960
Maxed out on his cards,
you know, that kind of thing.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.960
And the victim?

27:10.040 --> 27:12.560
Some savings put away,
about $12,000,
but that was dwindling fast.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.240
HUMPHREY: How come?

27:14.320 --> 27:16.480
Well, it looks
like he was taking out
$400 in cash every week.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.200
To do what?

27:18.280 --> 27:19.640
Search me.
Now I've gone
through all his outgoings

27:19.720 --> 27:21.400
and everything seems
to be accounted for.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.720
But this money
just seems to vanish!

27:23.800 --> 27:25.120
Strange. Keep digging.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.800
Yes, Chief.
See if you can find anything.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.120
Er, Florence?

27:28.200 --> 27:29.880
So I've been
through the phone records.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.280
Calls to and from
the victim's phone

27:32.360 --> 27:34.600
seem to match with
friends and family.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.920
But the call list
from the observatory

27:37.000 --> 27:39.160
landline did
show up something.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.760
This number here
has been called

27:40.840 --> 27:42.240
several times
the last few nights.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.480
It's pay-as-you go,
so no registered user,

27:44.560 --> 27:46.440
but look at the times.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.360
2:00 AM, 4:00 AM.

27:48.440 --> 27:50.920
That's what I thought.
Someone in
a different time-zone maybe?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.120
Have you dialled it?

27:52.200 --> 27:54.000
Goes straight
to the voicemail.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.520
Keep trying. Whoever it is
must turn it on
sooner or later.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.080
Er, JP.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.800
Did you manage to
speak to Dr Klein

27:58.880 --> 28:00.880
at the Carrington
Institute yet?

28:00.960 --> 28:03.600
Yes, it turns out
Dr Klein was trying
to get hold of Stephen Langham

28:03.680 --> 28:06.040
to talk to him
about an academic paper

28:06.120 --> 28:08.400
recently published
by Victoria Baker.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.320
Yes,
according to Dr Klein it was

28:10.400 --> 28:12.160
a fairly
ground-breaking study.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.600
I sense however there's
a "however" coming, JP?

28:14.680 --> 28:19.280
However, apparently the work
is all Stephen Langham's.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.840
Not Miss Baker's.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.240
See Stephen Langham
sent Dr Klein a draft

28:23.320 --> 28:25.280
of the same
paper two months ago.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.880
It was pretty
much word for word

28:26.960 --> 28:29.040
what was later published
under Victoria Baker's name.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.440
So, Miss Baker
had stolen Stephen's research?

28:31.520 --> 28:32.720
It's rather brazen, isn't it?

28:32.800 --> 28:34.760
JP: Dr Klein wasn't sure
how it all happened.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.400
But when they finally spoke,

28:36.480 --> 28:38.600
Stephen was regretful
about the whole thing.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.320
Said he'd discuss it with her.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.320
Next thing Dr Klein heard,
Stephen was dead.

28:47.680 --> 28:51.200
Stephen gave me his permission
to publish with sole credit.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.160
Sole credit?

28:53.240 --> 28:55.040
This was his work, wasn't it?

28:55.120 --> 28:57.080
Or have I misunderstood
and you worked
on this together?

28:57.160 --> 28:59.000
I contributed some material.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.800
But ultimately, yes,
it was Stephen's baby.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.040
Hmm.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.040
So then why would
he agree to have

29:04.120 --> 29:06.080
his name taken off,
and yours added?

29:06.160 --> 29:08.280
Because Stephen
couldn't care less

29:08.360 --> 29:10.400
about
recognition or notoriety.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.440
Whereas you do?

29:12.520 --> 29:14.560
So let me get this right.

29:14.640 --> 29:16.280
You saw this as
your ticket out of here

29:16.360 --> 29:19.080
and convinced
Stephen to give you
the credit for his work?

29:19.160 --> 29:21.960
I wouldn't put it
quite like that.
But yes.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.480
Stephen was happy to help.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.960
Not sure why,
but I wouldn't have

29:26.040 --> 29:28.480
imagined you as a smoker,
Miss Baker.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.320
Then you imagine right.
I'm not.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.160
I was sleeping with him.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.560
As I sense you've
already worked out.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.800
When exactly did you
start sleeping with him?

29:39.880 --> 29:40.880
Does it matter?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.160
Mmm-hmm.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.800
A couple of months ago.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.960
So right about the time,
that he'd finished his draft

29:48.040 --> 29:49.720
of the paper and
was due to publish?

29:51.760 --> 29:54.280
So, now you've uncovered
my shady little secret.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.640
Is there anything else?

29:55.720 --> 29:57.360
Oh, I'm afraid we're
not quite done yet.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.960
We believe Stephen may have
had a change of heart.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.040
He was going to
discuss it with you.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.720
Perhaps re-publish?

30:04.800 --> 30:05.800
We did discuss it.

30:05.880 --> 30:06.880
And?

30:06.960 --> 30:08.480
I managed to dissuade him.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.240
How?

30:13.840 --> 30:16.960
I certainly didn't kill him
if that's what
you're insinuating.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.600
Well, it's almost lunchtime
and there's been
no sign of him yet.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.520
Maybe he hasn't seen it.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.760
Maybe!

30:31.840 --> 30:32.880
And maybe
no-one's mentioned it.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.000
Officer Myers.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.480
DWAYNE:
Good afternoon, Commissioner.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.840
JP: Commissioner.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.000
Is everything all right?

30:45.960 --> 30:49.000
I was hoping to find
the Inspector here.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.920
But it appears he's out.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.840
Ah, yes, Sir.
He and DS Cassell
are interviewing a suspect.

30:54.920 --> 30:58.480
Well, in
the absence of the Inspector,

30:58.560 --> 31:01.400
perhaps you'd care
to help me, Officer Myers.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.280
Me?

31:03.360 --> 31:05.840
Yes.
We're going on a little trip.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.920
Officer Myers. I'm waiting.

31:22.840 --> 31:26.240
So...
How's your morning been,
Commissioner?

31:26.320 --> 31:27.960
Anything untoward?

31:28.600 --> 31:30.000
Untoward?

31:30.080 --> 31:32.320
Or just a normal
morning at the office?

31:32.400 --> 31:33.560
I haven't been
to the office yet.

31:33.640 --> 31:34.920
Oh.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.680
I've been doing a little
digging into our Mayor.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.920
The Mayor?
That's what this is about?

31:41.640 --> 31:43.600
Why?

31:43.680 --> 31:46.360
Is there something
else we should be
talking about, Officer Myers?

31:46.440 --> 31:48.280
Erm, no,
of course not, Commissioner.

31:48.360 --> 31:52.520
So, erm,
what has your digging dug up?

31:52.600 --> 31:55.160
Mayor Richards
has been meeting
with Stephen Langham

31:55.240 --> 31:57.240
at the Yacht Club recently.

31:57.320 --> 32:01.000
Apparently they've had quite
a few lunches that
got rather heated.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.080
They argued?

32:02.160 --> 32:03.400
It would seem so.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.080
I'm wondering if
it has something

32:05.160 --> 32:06.640
to do with the fact
that Mayor Richards

32:06.720 --> 32:08.640
applied for
planning permission

32:08.720 --> 32:11.240
to build a hotel
on this very beach.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.080
And what might this have to do
with Stephen Langham?

32:14.160 --> 32:16.080
You may not have noticed,
Officer Myers,

32:16.160 --> 32:18.880
but this beach sits
at the foot of the volcano.

32:18.960 --> 32:21.120
And this land was
previously designated

32:21.200 --> 32:25.120
exclusively to the observatory
for research purposes.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.000
Until Richards bought it?

32:27.080 --> 32:29.280
Exactly.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.240
But if Joseph
Richards owns the land,

32:31.320 --> 32:33.680
there's nothing
Langham and his team
can do about it, is there?

32:33.760 --> 32:34.880
There isn't.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.840
But those
heated lunch meetings

32:36.920 --> 32:38.560
must have been
about something.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.280
Speak of the devil.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.640
Commissioner.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.720
Is there anything I
can help you with?

32:47.800 --> 32:49.840
Only,
you are aware that you are

32:49.920 --> 32:51.960
trespassing on
private property.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.600
As a matter of fact there is.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.680
My officer here would like
to ask you a few questions.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.720
Yeah?
Wouldn't you?

32:58.800 --> 33:01.520
Oh, yes, Commissioner.

33:01.600 --> 33:04.360
Now, we understand that you
and Stephen Langham

33:04.440 --> 33:06.640
had been meeting up
at the Yacht Club?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.600
Is eating lunch a crime,
Officer?

33:08.680 --> 33:14.160
No,
sir, but we understand those
meetings became quite heated.

33:14.240 --> 33:17.000
Listen,
over the five last years

33:17.080 --> 33:19.880
the volcano observatory
has seen its funding reduced.

33:19.960 --> 33:22.920
Stephen was naturally
very angry about that.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.360
Hmm. And what about the fact
that you're
building a hotel on land

33:27.440 --> 33:30.080
the observatory
previously used
for research work, hmm?

33:30.160 --> 33:31.440
What about it?

33:31.520 --> 33:33.040
Did that make
Stephen Langham angry too?

33:33.120 --> 33:34.480
No. Not at all.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.280
The beach itself
wasn't an issue for Stephen.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.840
There were plenty
of other sites they could use.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.160
It is a very big volcano,
after all.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.240
Was there anything else?

33:51.760 --> 33:54.880
That Mayor Richards
is a slippery fish.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.560
The slipperiest.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.560
You know why I detest
the likes of Joseph Richards?

34:00.640 --> 34:03.960
Because he's interested
in one thing and
one thing only.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.360
Himself.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.760
He doesn't give
a damn about this island.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.000
Or the people that live on it.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.240
And they deserve better
than that from their Mayor.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.600
I'll speak to
the Inspector, Commissioner.

34:14.680 --> 34:16.640
See if we can do a bit
of digging of our own.

34:18.160 --> 34:21.720
So, erm, is that everything?

34:21.800 --> 34:23.360
Nothing else you
want to talk about?

34:23.440 --> 34:25.000
Erm,

34:27.240 --> 34:28.520
that's it.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.040
For now.

34:40.600 --> 34:41.840
Hello! Come in.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.240
Oh, so this is your shack.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.880
It's lovely.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.360
Yes. It's not bad, is it?

34:48.440 --> 34:51.640
Welcome to the lounge,
er, come bedroom.

34:52.960 --> 34:57.040
Ah, gosh, look at the view.

34:57.120 --> 35:00.320
You are so lucky waking up
to that every day.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.680
Yes, I do often pinch myself
of a morning.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.280
Well, not literally,
obviously, I don't, er...

35:05.360 --> 35:06.440
Yes.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.800
Would you like a drink?
I have wine.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.680
Ah, yeah, that'd be lovely.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.720
Good, erm, why don't you
make yourself at home

35:11.800 --> 35:13.800
on the veranda and,
er, I'll...

35:13.880 --> 35:15.040
Okay.
Yes.

35:15.120 --> 35:17.680
Sorry. (CLEARS THROAT)

35:26.680 --> 35:27.680
Here we go.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.720
Thank you.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.800
So. Here we are.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.200
Yeah. Here we are.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.840
Yes.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.280
To us.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.400
Yes.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.120
To us.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.560
Here.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.520
You know, it's really nice
having you here, Martha.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.400
Really nice.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.040
It's really nice being here.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.960
I'm glad I came back.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.200
Yes.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.640
Is that a lizard?

36:30.720 --> 36:31.720
Huh?

36:33.840 --> 36:35.960
Oh, yes, this is Harry.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.440
Sort of a flat mate.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.280
Oh, he's adorable.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.560
Is he?

36:42.640 --> 36:43.840
MARTHA: Aw.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.160
HUMPHREY:
He never lets me do that.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.960
Oh, bless him.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.520
Yes. Bless him.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.600
Morning, Florence.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.520
Morning, sir.
I'm afraid you have
to get back in the jeep.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.360
Do I?
Yeah we've had a call out.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.520
There's been an assault
reported at the observatory.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.360
Dwayne and JP are
already at the scene.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.720
Oh, crikey.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.280
Chief.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.600
JP.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.360
So, the postman called it in.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.240
He arrived about
half an hour ago

37:31.320 --> 37:34.560
to find Daniel
Langham on the ground
having been assaulted.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.120
He said the two
guys who did it
were shouting at him,

37:37.200 --> 37:39.040
something about
money being owed.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.960
When they saw
they had company,

37:41.040 --> 37:43.440
they got
straight into their car
and drove off.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.000
Loan sharks, maybe?

37:45.080 --> 37:47.600
Yes, maybe, Florence.
We know he had debts but...

37:47.680 --> 37:49.000
Touch of flu.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.320
He was taking out $400
in cash every week.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.800
Oh, gosh of course!

37:53.880 --> 37:55.960
The long sleeves.
The runny nose.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.680
That absent demeanour.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.960
What took me so long?

38:00.040 --> 38:01.400
Dwayne.
DWAYNE: Chief.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.760
He's in the medical room.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.000
Thank you.

38:07.400 --> 38:10.120
You can go.
I'm not pressing charges.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.520
No, I don't imagine you are.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.440
So how long
this been going on?

38:15.520 --> 38:16.880
What do you mean?

38:16.960 --> 38:18.880
Your drug habit?

38:18.960 --> 38:21.040
I assume that's who did this,
your dealers.

38:26.400 --> 38:27.880
It's been on and off.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.320
A while.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.880
You'd be surprised how dreary
the world of science becomes

38:32.960 --> 38:34.600
when you reach
a certain level.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.040
Not everyone was like Stephen.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.920
Going into raptures
at the sight of a crater.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.320
So he knew, I take it?

38:42.440 --> 38:44.000
He didn't get it.

38:44.080 --> 38:47.360
Why someone "so gifted"
would lose his way like this.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.680
After all,
I had the same parents,
same opportunities,

38:52.520 --> 38:55.680
very similar path.

38:55.760 --> 38:59.880
After all this
time he still thought
I'd kick the habit.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.880
But he still gave
you money, didn't he?

39:02.920 --> 39:04.360
He supported your habit.

39:04.440 --> 39:05.760
He gave me an allowance.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.760
Yes, but you needed more?

39:07.840 --> 39:09.240
That's why you got
beaten up this morning?

39:09.320 --> 39:11.920
Well, what's $400 a week?
It's nothing.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.400
All I asked was to
take it up to 500.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.200
It's not as if he had
a family to support.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.880
What?

39:17.960 --> 39:19.800
We never actually
checked Stephen's will.

39:19.880 --> 39:23.480
But I assume that if something
happened to him,
you'd inherit?

39:23.560 --> 39:26.960
Yes, I would but it's no more
than a few thousand dollars.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.760
No.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.560
That's not enough to make me
wanna kill him, believe me.

39:31.640 --> 39:32.840
Yes, well,
I would never underestimate

39:32.920 --> 39:34.080
the lengths
an addict would go to

39:34.160 --> 39:36.320
to get their next fix,
Mr Langham.

39:44.920 --> 39:47.320
So, Daniel Langham,
a functioning drug addict,

39:47.400 --> 39:50.000
denies having killed
his brother for money.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.840
Victoria Baker says
she didn't do it either,

39:51.920 --> 39:55.040
despite Stephen
being on the verge
of ruining her career.

39:55.120 --> 39:58.560
And Emer Byrne
arrived on the island
assuming a false identity,

39:58.640 --> 40:00.560
claims she's not
our killer either

40:00.640 --> 40:03.040
because Stephen
was unaware of her deceit.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.400
Which leaves
only Mayor Richards.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.520
HUMPHREY:
Yes, indeed, Florence.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.120
So, chaps, how we getting on

40:08.200 --> 40:10.000
with digging a little deeper
into his affairs?

40:10.080 --> 40:12.400
This is really hard going
you know, Chief.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.680
This guy's finances
are spread all over the place.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.400
Different bank accounts.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.520
Investments. Hedge funds.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.640
Seems he's got three different
accountants working for him.

40:21.720 --> 40:25.400
One thing I am sure of,
Mayor Richards
is not short of a bob or two.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.920
Yes, well, keep at it, Dwayne.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.680
JP?
Well, sir.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.040
I got the file
on Mayor Richards'
beach hotel proposal

40:31.120 --> 40:33.480
from the planning office
and I've been
going through it.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.800
Now it seems like the Mayor
needed the observatory

40:35.880 --> 40:37.880
to sign off
the development plans

40:37.960 --> 40:40.320
see the exclusion
zone had to be moved
by a couple of hundred metres

40:40.400 --> 40:44.160
to exclude the beach,
but er,
there's been no objections.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.120
Good. Right, Florence.

40:46.200 --> 40:50.440
Let's you and I
go back to where
it all started two nights ago,

40:50.520 --> 40:54.240
halfway up
Mount Esmee volcano.

40:54.320 --> 40:59.160
Now perhaps we could
help ourselves
with a visual aid.

40:59.240 --> 41:03.200
So, Stephen Langham decides

41:03.280 --> 41:07.080
to spend
the night on Mount Esmee.

41:07.160 --> 41:12.000
He is discovered
dead the next morning

41:12.080 --> 41:15.200
and everything
points to his death
being natural causes.

41:15.280 --> 41:19.240
Specifically, a heart attack.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.600
However,
because there was no torch
left with the victim's body,

41:22.680 --> 41:25.160
we are left questioning
whether Stephen Langham

41:25.240 --> 41:26.800
was up that volcano alone,

41:26.880 --> 41:28.560
whether someone
was there with him,

41:28.640 --> 41:31.320
someone who needed
his torch to make

41:31.400 --> 41:34.040
their journey back
to this observatory.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.200
Here.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.000
However.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.560
According to the entry log,

41:39.640 --> 41:41.680
none of our suspects
left the observatory

41:41.760 --> 41:44.960
and then re-entered between
Stephen Langham
setting off at 9:06 PM,

41:45.040 --> 41:46.840
and then Mayor Richards
arriving the next morning.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.160
So,

41:48.240 --> 41:50.720
if one of this
lot did kill him,

41:50.800 --> 41:53.320
how did they manage to get out
of this observatory here,

41:53.400 --> 41:55.040
make it up to
this volcano here,

41:55.120 --> 41:57.960
and then back again unnoticed?

41:58.040 --> 42:01.040
Sir, shouldn't Mayor Richards
have his own whiteboard?

42:01.120 --> 42:03.600
Like considering he
wasn't on the island
when it all happened?

42:03.680 --> 42:05.560
Yes, I suppose he should.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.800
Okay.

42:12.880 --> 42:18.440
Right, let's imagine, JP,
your computer
monitor is Guadeloupe.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.040
Oh, dear,
no, that's no good at all.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.240
What isn't, sir?

42:23.320 --> 42:25.000
Well,
I can't see the Mayor now.

42:25.080 --> 42:27.240
And if I'm looking
at Mayor Richards,

42:27.320 --> 42:29.840
then I can't see
the observatory
or the volcano.

42:29.920 --> 42:31.800
That's not good at all, erm...

42:33.680 --> 42:35.160
Wait a minute...

42:37.760 --> 42:39.720
Of course I can't.
Can't what?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.000
Well,
I can't see Mayor Richards

42:41.080 --> 42:42.280
if I'm looking
at that volcano.

42:42.360 --> 42:43.640
Equally I can't
see the observatory

42:43.720 --> 42:45.200
if I'm looking
at Mayor Richards.

42:45.280 --> 42:47.000
And for that matter
if I'm looking at the volcano

42:47.080 --> 42:49.360
then I definitely cannot
see the observatory.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.560
Which could very possibly
explain how it was done.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.800
DWAYNE:
He came up here last night
to check the seisometer.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.080
DANIEL: It was his
turn on night duty.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.800
FLORENCE: Can't murder someone
with a heart attack.

43:00.880 --> 43:02.280
EMER: Called me his protege.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.600
DWAYNE: A slippery fish.

43:03.680 --> 43:05.680
HUMPHREY:
The cause of death is hypoxia.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.840
It turns pink when
an acid is added.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.560
EMER: My names Emer Byrne...

43:09.640 --> 43:10.600
HUMPHREY: Daniel Langham,
a functioning drug addict...

43:10.680 --> 43:12.240
A creature of habit.

43:12.320 --> 43:13.600
VICTORIA:
There's the swipe system...

43:13.680 --> 43:14.600
HUMPHREY: Where do you
keep your torches?

43:14.680 --> 43:16.120
DWAYNE: Victoria Baker.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.880
I wouldn't trust him
as far as I could throw him.

43:18.920 --> 43:22.600
But why, why kill him?

43:22.680 --> 43:24.480
DWAYNE: Chief?
I think I might
have found something.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.360
Dwayne.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.000
Mayor Richards
has an off-shore
bank account in Guadeloupe.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.200
That's why he was
there yesterday.

43:29.280 --> 43:30.520
He made a cash withdrawal.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.840
How much?

43:31.920 --> 43:33.720
Four million
Eastern Caribbean Dollars.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.040
In cash?

43:35.120 --> 43:36.400
Oh, yes, Chief.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.000
That's the kind of money
you just might kill for.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.080
JP. The planning document.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.920
I need to know who
signed off on it.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.880
Of course it was.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.080
I take it you...

43:49.160 --> 43:50.240
Yes, I have.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.840
And I assume you want us to...

43:51.920 --> 43:53.800
Yes, I do.

43:53.880 --> 43:58.280
But first, Dwayne, JP,
I might need you to
go on a little hunt.

43:58.360 --> 43:59.480
What for, Chief?

43:59.560 --> 44:00.920
A mobile phone.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.840
And Florence, we need to go
and have a look

44:02.920 --> 44:04.360
at one of
the suspect's bedrooms.
Whose?

44:06.920 --> 44:08.600
Victoria Baker's.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.640
Oh, so obvious.

44:23.840 --> 44:25.640
Now if I'm not mistaken...

44:28.800 --> 44:30.080
Bingo.

44:32.120 --> 44:33.520
Look at that.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.640
Mount Esmee.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.680
A thing of awe and wonder.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.760
No-one understood
more than Stephen

44:40.840 --> 44:42.800
about the power and
danger of volcanoes.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.680
It's for that very reason

44:44.760 --> 44:47.920
that he was found murdered
on one of Mount
Esmee's slopes.

44:49.440 --> 44:53.720
The question is,
which of you did it?

44:53.800 --> 44:56.280
I wasn't even on Saint Marie
on the night
that Stephen died.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.400
In many ways, Mr Richards,

44:58.480 --> 45:00.920
you are responsible
for Stephen Langham's death.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.640
But, no.

45:03.960 --> 45:05.320
It wasn't you that killed him.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.360
So who did?

45:11.600 --> 45:13.320
It was you, Victoria.

45:13.920 --> 45:14.960
Me?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.760
And you, Daniel.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.080
And you, Emer.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.920
You all killed
Stephen Langham together.
Didn't you?

45:32.000 --> 45:33.120
This is ridiculous.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.200
You're not serious?

45:34.280 --> 45:36.400
I'm deadly serious.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.880
You, all three of you,
murdered Mr Langham

45:38.960 --> 45:42.040
and staged it to look like
he died of natural causes.

45:42.120 --> 45:44.640
A second heart attack.

45:44.720 --> 45:48.640
Brought on by the walk he made
up that volcano
the same night.

45:48.720 --> 45:51.120
That's what happened.
He died of a heart attack.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.800
I admit it very
much looked like that.

45:53.880 --> 45:55.640
I mean, even
the pathologist was ready

45:55.720 --> 45:58.560
to sign it off
as natural causes.

45:58.640 --> 46:01.760
There was one
thing that niggled me.

46:01.840 --> 46:06.120
The absence of a torch
at the crime scene.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.160
How did Mr Langham manage
to walk just over a mile

46:09.240 --> 46:14.200
up a volcano in the dark
without a torch
to light his way?

46:14.280 --> 46:18.040
Well, the answer to that
is that, er, he didn't.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.640
It very much looked like
that's what happened.

46:20.720 --> 46:25.560
What actually took place
was an incredible
piece of misdirection.

46:25.640 --> 46:29.400
All along we were
looking at the volcano
as the scene of the crime.

46:29.480 --> 46:32.360
When actually
the truth of the matter is

46:32.440 --> 46:35.760
Stephen Langham didn't die
on the side of Mount Esmee.

46:35.840 --> 46:39.880
He was murdered
in his own bedroom
here inside the observatory.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.080
See on
the evening he was killed,
Stephen Langham decided

46:43.160 --> 46:45.840
he needed to go up Mount Esmee
and spend the night.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.640
I'll go back up tonight.

46:47.720 --> 46:49.680
At least that way we'll know
for sure what's going on.

46:49.760 --> 46:52.560
It was his turn on night duty.

46:52.640 --> 46:55.040
But the truth is
the irregular readings

46:55.120 --> 46:57.040
that were coming through
on the seismograph,

46:57.120 --> 47:00.760
they weren't down to either
seismic tremors
or animal activity.

47:00.840 --> 47:04.040
They'd been
manufactured by you.

47:04.120 --> 47:07.480
The phone
records of calls made
from the observatory landline

47:07.560 --> 47:10.440
showed up a mobile number
we couldn't trace.

47:10.520 --> 47:13.520
One that was being called
from inside this building

47:13.600 --> 47:16.840
at odd hours during the night.

47:16.920 --> 47:18.840
It was in one of
the rubbish bins, sir.

47:18.920 --> 47:21.320
Thank you, JP.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.440
Florence,
er, do you have the number?

47:25.320 --> 47:26.920
(MOBILE VIBRATES)

47:29.120 --> 47:30.680
HUMPHREY: So who did
the phone belong to?

47:34.240 --> 47:36.960
It belonged to you lot.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.040
And I believe you
placed it up there
with the seismometer.

47:42.680 --> 47:45.520
You then dialled
it intermittently
over a three night period

47:45.600 --> 47:48.600
to upset the readings from
the extremely
sensitive instruments

47:48.680 --> 47:52.200
and lead Stephen to think
it was cause for concern.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.360
The afternoon of his murder,

47:54.440 --> 47:58.960
you both headed
up to supposedly
check on the seismometer.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.160
Having removed
the phone first,

48:01.240 --> 48:02.560
you convinced
Stephen there was

48:02.640 --> 48:03.880
nothing wrong
with the equipment.

48:03.960 --> 48:05.400
Sensors are clean.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.840
Thus forcing him
to make the decision

48:07.920 --> 48:09.480
that someone needed
to spend the night

48:09.560 --> 48:11.000
monitoring
the situation on Mount Esmee.

48:11.080 --> 48:13.840
And as he went off
to his room to prepare

48:13.920 --> 48:17.280
that's when your plan
to kill him kicked in.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.200
Let's go.

48:20.280 --> 48:23.520
How do you kill a man
with a heart attack?

48:23.600 --> 48:24.960
Well, once I
realised that he wasn't

48:25.040 --> 48:26.320
actually killed
up that volcano,

48:26.400 --> 48:29.400
then, er, things became
a little clearer.

48:29.480 --> 48:34.520
The post mortem showed
that Stephen
died from hypoxia.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.160
Which means he
stopped breathing.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.240
Now we know he
wasn't smothered.

48:38.320 --> 48:41.800
So how else might you cause
a man to die from hypoxia?

48:46.560 --> 48:48.520
You'd gas him.

48:48.600 --> 48:51.960
FLORENCE: You keep canisters
of CO2 in your
medical room here.

48:52.040 --> 48:55.240
And up to five
percent CO2 can be
added to pure oxygen

48:55.320 --> 48:59.400
to help provoke breathing
and stabilise
balance in blood.

48:59.480 --> 49:03.640
But CO2 on its own,
pure carbon dioxide,
is lethal.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.160
And that's what was used
to kill Stephen Langham.

49:08.240 --> 49:12.040
HUMPHREY: You gassed Stephen
in his own bedroom.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.360
How can we be sure of this?

49:14.440 --> 49:15.720
Phenolphthalein.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.760
There were vials of it
on Stephen's desk.

49:17.840 --> 49:21.240
I assume he'd
been using it for
some kind of soil analysis.

49:21.320 --> 49:23.400
It didn't really
mean anything at first.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.280
And I couldn't quite remember
how the stuff works.

49:26.360 --> 49:31.160
But, er, once we'd worked out
what you'd done,
I double checked.

49:31.240 --> 49:33.480
You see its
natural colour is pink.

49:33.560 --> 49:37.320
But the phenolphthalein
in Stephen's
room was colourless.

49:37.400 --> 49:39.560
Which is caused
when acid is added.

49:40.680 --> 49:45.440
And CO2 is an acidic gas.

49:45.520 --> 49:49.000
With Stephen dead, you took
the stretcher from
the medical room,

49:49.080 --> 49:52.680
and you placed
Stephen on to it.

49:52.760 --> 49:57.480
Daniel. We know that Stephen's
choice of clothing was,
erm, limited.

49:57.560 --> 49:58.760
I can't imagine
it would have been

49:58.840 --> 50:00.280
too hard to
find another outfit

50:00.360 --> 50:02.320
that would have matched
the one he died in.

50:02.400 --> 50:05.080
And with Stephen's cap
as the finishing touch

50:05.160 --> 50:07.000
keeping your face
slightly concealed.

50:07.080 --> 50:09.560
It was no surprise
that we didn't notice

50:09.640 --> 50:12.520
it was you seen on
the CCTV that night.

50:12.600 --> 50:14.120
FLORENCE:
All of which made us believe

50:14.200 --> 50:18.280
Stephen left the observatory
just after 9:00 PM.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.400
And as you used
his swipe card,

50:20.480 --> 50:23.000
it was also
confirmed by the log.

50:23.080 --> 50:26.360
You then walked
the stretchered body
a mile up the volcano

50:26.440 --> 50:30.080
and then left it there
to be discovered
the next morning.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.720
HUMPHREY:
And then all the pair of you

50:31.800 --> 50:33.240
had to do was be
patient and wait

50:33.320 --> 50:35.720
outside the observatory.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.400
Because for the final piece
of your plan to work,

50:38.480 --> 50:40.440
you needed Mayor
Richards to arrive

50:40.520 --> 50:42.400
and act as
an unwitting accomplice

50:42.480 --> 50:46.280
that you were all present
at the observatory
that morning.

50:46.360 --> 50:49.280
That way when we came
and checked the door log,

50:49.360 --> 50:52.240
it would appear
that no-one left

50:52.320 --> 50:54.120
or re-entered
the building between

50:54.200 --> 50:55.960
Stephen leaving and
the Mayor arriving.

50:56.040 --> 50:57.880
Because Victoria
held the door ajar

50:57.960 --> 50:59.680
after letting
you both back in.

50:59.760 --> 51:02.280
An elaborate
yet very clever plan indeed.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.600
And you know it almost worked.

51:04.680 --> 51:06.960
If it hadn't been
for your one mistake.

51:07.040 --> 51:10.120
Not taking a torch up to leave
with Stephen's body.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.440
You know, if you had, well...

51:13.520 --> 51:16.840
Even I'd have been convinced
it was death by
natural causes.

51:16.920 --> 51:20.360
But why? Why would
they do such a thing?

51:22.680 --> 51:24.840
Oh, I think you already know,
Mr Richards.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.360
It's because of you.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.920
We know that you needed
the observatory to
officially sign off

51:30.000 --> 51:32.600
on your planning proposal
because you needed

51:32.680 --> 51:36.920
them to move
the volcano exclusion zone
so you could build your hotel.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.400
You are aware that you are
trespassing on
private property.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.360
I think that's what you
and Stephen Langham

51:42.440 --> 51:44.080
were arguing about
at the Yacht Club.

51:45.360 --> 51:47.560
I think he was
against the idea.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.840
I imagine you offered him
an incentive or two.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.600
A rather healthy
back hander, no doubt.

51:52.680 --> 51:54.480
But I assume he was unwavering

51:54.560 --> 51:57.920
and he refused
to take the risk
to move the exclusion zone,

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
even if it was only
a couple of hundred metres.

52:01.080 --> 52:03.520
On the same day as
Stephen's body was found,

52:03.600 --> 52:06.720
the deadline for your hotel
planning application was up.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.240
That's why you'd come
to see him that morning.

52:09.320 --> 52:13.520
We think a meeting
was due to take place
in which you expected Stephen

52:13.600 --> 52:15.920
to sign off on moving
the exclusion zone,

52:16.000 --> 52:18.160
thus granting you
planning consent.

52:18.240 --> 52:20.640
But how could you be
so sure that he would sign

52:20.720 --> 52:23.600
after he'd been so
adamant he wouldn't?

52:23.680 --> 52:26.240
Because you'd enrolled
someone to help you.

52:26.320 --> 52:28.960
Someone who maybe
had Stephen's ear.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.320
Someone who was
more amenable to your

52:31.400 --> 52:33.520
offers of money
than Stephen was.

52:39.240 --> 52:43.040
But, things didn't
quite go to plan,
did they, Victoria?

52:43.120 --> 52:46.160
Stephen wouldn't
budge on his decision.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.080
I mean, you might've been able
to use certain ways

52:48.160 --> 52:51.840
and means to get
him to accredit
you on an academic paper.

52:51.920 --> 52:54.360
But when it came to something
like moving an exclusion zone,

52:54.440 --> 52:56.800
something that
will affect the lives

52:56.880 --> 52:59.160
of other people,
he would not be moved.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.240
Which is when you
decided the only way

53:01.320 --> 53:04.160
to get the money
was to kill him.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.720
HUMPHREY: Now, I'm not
quite sure how you managed

53:05.800 --> 53:07.760
to convince them
to help you kill Stephen.

53:07.840 --> 53:10.440
But I'd say the splitting of
four million
Eastern Caribbean Dollars

53:10.520 --> 53:12.400
wasn't too much of a sell.

53:12.480 --> 53:15.200
I mean we knew
Daniel had grown
frustrated with his brother

53:15.280 --> 53:17.040
and needed the money.

53:17.120 --> 53:19.560
And in his permanent
drug-induced state,

53:19.640 --> 53:22.640
I'm sure it wasn't that hard
to wear down his defences.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.800
And Emer.

53:24.880 --> 53:27.040
I think you genuinely
cared about Stephen.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.720
I'm guessing that
Victoria found out
about your secret, didn't she?

53:29.800 --> 53:33.400
And used it to bully you into
joining them in their plan.

53:33.480 --> 53:35.120
(SOBBING)

53:35.200 --> 53:39.400
So that's how they did it.
And that's why they did it.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.840
They might each
have had their own
motive to take Stephen's life,

53:44.400 --> 53:47.160
but it was you who provided
the extra incentive.

53:47.240 --> 53:50.400
The final nail in the coffin,
if you will.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.480
If you weren't an accessory
before the fact,

53:52.560 --> 53:54.600
you certainly were after it.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.120
Arrest them all.

54:08.840 --> 54:10.200
(DWAYNE WHISTLING)

54:10.280 --> 54:11.560
You seem to be in
good spirits, Dwayne.

54:11.640 --> 54:13.320
Well, JP.

54:13.400 --> 54:16.040
Let's just say the day ended
a lot better than it started.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.880
And I have to admit,
there's no-one

54:17.960 --> 54:19.640
more surprised
about that than me.

54:19.720 --> 54:21.840
Good evening, Officer Myers.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.200
Commissioner.

54:23.280 --> 54:25.400
I believe
a number of arrests have

54:25.480 --> 54:27.520
been made,
including Mayor Richards.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.480
Oh, yes, Commissioner.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.120
Though we couldn't
have done it without you.

54:31.200 --> 54:34.400
Team work, Officer Myers.
Always team work.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.840
Well, enjoy your evening.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.200
Thank you, Commissioner.
You too.

54:41.960 --> 54:45.640
Oh, erm, one more thing,
Officer Myers.

54:45.720 --> 54:49.440
Regarding yesterday's article
in the Saint Marie Times.

54:49.520 --> 54:52.720
I'm going to
give you the benefit
of the doubt and assume

54:52.800 --> 54:54.720
you were wildly misquoted.

54:54.800 --> 54:57.560
A case of,
er, journalistic hubris.

54:57.640 --> 54:59.440
That's exactly
what it was, Commissioner.

54:59.520 --> 55:00.560
Hubris.

55:00.640 --> 55:02.000
And the thing is
that Justine...

55:02.080 --> 55:05.560
But if I ever hear you refer
to me as a goat,

55:05.640 --> 55:09.040
or indeed any other sort
of farmyard animal again,

55:09.120 --> 55:11.960
you can be sure I
won't be so forgiving.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.400
No, Commissioner.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.760
Sorry, Commissioner.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.120
I think I should
buy you a drink.

55:30.040 --> 55:31.520
And three beers.

55:31.600 --> 55:33.080
Thank you.

55:33.160 --> 55:35.920
So there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.800
Something's been
playing on my mind.

55:37.880 --> 55:39.400
Oh. Sounds serious.

55:39.480 --> 55:42.360
Oh, well, I wouldn't say
it was serious, necessarily.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.000
But to the same extent,
I wouldn't want you to think

55:44.080 --> 55:45.760
it was something
I took lightly.

55:45.840 --> 55:47.400
Er, and in that respect, er,

55:47.480 --> 55:49.080
it would be great to get
your thoughts on the matter.

55:49.160 --> 55:51.000
I agree. We should kiss.

55:52.160 --> 55:53.560
Do you?

55:53.640 --> 55:55.360
And I think we
should do it now.

55:55.440 --> 55:56.640
Really?

55:56.720 --> 55:57.840
Right now, in fact.

55:57.920 --> 55:59.640
Blimey.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.240
Well, I mean,
if you absolutely insist.

56:02.320 --> 56:03.560
I do.

56:12.320 --> 56:13.520
Oh.
(MARTHA GIGGLES)

56:14.360 --> 56:15.360
That's very, er...

56:15.440 --> 56:16.440
Nice?

56:16.520 --> 56:18.680
Yes, great word.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.640
Sorry, can I just...

56:27.800 --> 56:30.000
Gosh.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.480
I think I could do with
a drink after that.

56:31.560 --> 56:33.320
Ah, yes, er, me too.

56:37.240 --> 56:40.760
Er, Catherine,
can I have two beers, please,

56:40.840 --> 56:44.680
and maybe I'll
have a rum as well.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.360
Coming right up, Humphrey.

56:46.440 --> 56:48.840
Thank you.

56:48.920 --> 56:51.440
Everything seems to be
going well with Martha, sir.

56:51.520 --> 56:54.240
Yes, yes it does, doesn't it?

56:54.320 --> 56:55.560
Very.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.240
JP: Body of a young woman's
just been found

57:11.320 --> 57:13.080
on the beach of
the Malbonne estate.

57:13.160 --> 57:14.760
FLORENCE: That's
Sylvie Baptiste's home.

57:14.840 --> 57:17.000
She wrote a novel
we all studied at school.

57:17.080 --> 57:18.520
If Esther was
pushed to her death,

57:18.600 --> 57:19.960
it has to be one
of them that did it.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.360
I went to school with her.

57:21.440 --> 57:23.280
It's not your fault
Esther died, Florence.

57:23.360 --> 57:26.280
These girls are young,
they're hormonal,
they do flirt.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.040
Do we take it things
are going well with Martha?

57:28.120 --> 57:29.800
She's moving in
for the rest of her stay.

57:29.880 --> 57:31.960
DWAYNE: Er, excuse me...

57:33.120 --> 57:34.520
Nice to meet you too!
