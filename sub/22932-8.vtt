00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:07.290 --> 00:09.540
I can't believe someone robbed
the Bait and Bite.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.830
And what kind of thief
leaves one boot

00:11.830 --> 00:14.330
I mean, if you're going to steal
the left, why leave the right?!

00:14.330 --> 00:15.620
Cops don't have a single lead.

00:15.620 --> 00:18.120
No forced entry.
No broken windows.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.670
These guys were pros.

00:19.670 --> 00:22.170
They even took my tuna sandwich
out of the fridge.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.460
The joke's on them,
it was from last week.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.460
Good thing my slushy machine
is bolted down

00:26.460 --> 00:28.120
or they would've taken it too.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.710
I don't take chances
with my baby.

00:29.710 --> 00:31.710
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job,

00:31.710 --> 00:32.710
but I'm going to.

00:32.710 --> 00:34.460
Where's the CSI unit?

00:34.460 --> 00:36.330
Isn't anybody
looking for heat signatures?

00:36.330 --> 00:37.960
We're happy to help.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.290
You may remember us

00:39.290 --> 00:41.290
as streetwise detectives
Peeby and Jay

00:41.290 --> 00:43.170
from our brother's
student film.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.750
- If not,
we'll send you the link.
- Mm-hmm.

00:48.750 --> 00:52.460
Man, they even took
the dollar I had framed.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.830
It was the first one I made
as owner of the store.

00:54.830 --> 00:57.500
Oh, I hope this place
does well.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.790
Because paying
for two kids' college--

00:59.790 --> 01:02.420
ugh, I can't even imagine.

01:02.420 --> 01:06.040
Mr. President,
may you be the first of many.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.580
Ah.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.170
Out of everything they took,

01:16.170 --> 01:18.500
that dollar hurts the most.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.620
Sorry, Dad.

01:20.620 --> 01:23.250
I'd say we play
that singing bass
that always cheers you up,

01:23.250 --> 01:26.540
but they stole that too.

01:26.540 --> 01:29.210
Have the police checked
the security camera footage yet?

01:29.210 --> 01:32.540
They're doing it
as we speak.

01:32.540 --> 01:34.330
Oh.

01:35.790 --> 01:38.330
Do we know if Dad
had any of the snails

01:38.330 --> 01:39.880
from the bait tank
"chipped"?

01:39.880 --> 01:41.500
Smart thinking.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.750
Let's tell the cops to commit
all their resources to it.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.540
Whoa.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.000
Let the officers do their job.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.540
- They're stretched too thin.
- Mm-hmm.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.000
They need our help.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
- Your help, not helpful.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.540
Besides, the security footage

01:55.540 --> 01:57.580
will tell us
everything we need to know.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.420
Bad news.
The security camera
didn't record.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.620
What

02:04.620 --> 02:06.500
Just bad luck, I guess.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.580
But it's never
done that before.

02:08.580 --> 02:10.830
You know what, Harls,
uh, why don't you take
the boys home?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.000
I'll meet you there.

02:13.830 --> 02:15.830
The camera
didn't catch anything,

02:15.830 --> 02:17.620
so I'll have to.

02:17.620 --> 02:19.420
Criminals,
if you're watching this,

02:19.420 --> 02:21.670
turn yourself in while you can.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.580

03:17.290 --> 03:19.080
Okay, it's up to us kids

03:19.080 --> 03:21.290
to figure out
who robbed the store.

03:21.290 --> 03:23.540
We can't trust our parents
with a mystery this big.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.710
She's right. Dad can't
find his keys when they're
the only thing on the table.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.540
Let's talk suspects.

03:29.540 --> 03:34.500
Rachel's ex-boyfriend
and former Bait and Bite
employee...

03:34.500 --> 03:35.750
Cuff.

03:35.750 --> 03:38.580
A broken heart, busted career,

03:38.580 --> 03:40.120
and he knows where
all the keys are.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.670
Cuff had plenty of reasons
to rob the store.

03:42.670 --> 03:46.000
But so did fishing phenom
and disgruntled tenant...

03:46.000 --> 03:47.540
Colt Bailey.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.330
We destroyed his stuff,

03:49.330 --> 03:51.920
and his dog ate our couch
and pooped pillows for a week.

03:51.920 --> 03:56.540
You want motive? Look no further
than Dad's biggest competition.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.540
Rod from Rod's Reel and Deal.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.250
He'd do anything
to shut down the store.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.210
And look at this.

04:07.210 --> 04:08.750
Come on down to Rod's!

04:08.750 --> 04:10.750
We recently expanded
our inventory,

04:10.750 --> 04:14.120
and it's priced to move!

04:14.120 --> 04:15.380
Come on down!

04:18.210 --> 04:20.000
Whoo! That's hot!

04:20.000 --> 04:21.500
Just like these deals!

04:22.620 --> 04:26.080
"Expanded inventory"?

04:26.080 --> 04:28.080
In other words, Dad's stuff.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.330
I've got a suspect.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.710
Georgie.

04:35.710 --> 04:39.460
Maybe she's not really
at basketball camp. Hmm?

04:39.460 --> 04:40.580
Think about it,

04:40.580 --> 04:42.830
she says she goes,

04:42.830 --> 04:45.420
but she never comes back better.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.420
Hmm?

04:48.670 --> 04:51.790
Okay, everybody
do some investigating,

04:51.790 --> 04:53.790
and we'll meet back here
in a couple of hours.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.790
And it wasn't Georgie.

04:55.790 --> 04:58.620
She doesn't get better
because she's bad at basketball.

04:58.620 --> 05:01.170
I can say that
because she's not here.

05:05.210 --> 05:07.170
What are you kids up to?

05:07.170 --> 05:09.420
Trying to see
if we can track down
who robbed the store.

05:09.420 --> 05:13.460
No takers on my ad
so far looking for
"recently stolen canoes."

05:13.460 --> 05:14.920
They may be smarter
than we think.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.920
Well, it's too bad
the security footage got stolen,

05:16.920 --> 05:18.670
it would've been helpful.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.670
Stolen?

05:20.670 --> 05:22.960
Dad said the camera
didn't work.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.460
Well, if it was stolen,
it couldn't work.

05:27.790 --> 05:29.040
If it was stolen,

05:29.040 --> 05:30.880
why wouldn't he
just say "stolen"?

05:30.880 --> 05:33.670
Broken... stolen...
cat, dog, pie,

05:33.670 --> 05:34.670
they're all just words.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.420
Shoot, I hear the dryer beeper.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.790
Okay, that made no sense,

05:40.790 --> 05:43.000
and the dryer's not upstairs.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.830
Mom and Dad
are acting strange.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.420
You're just noticing now
Mom and Dad are strange.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.080
They're hiding something.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.330
It's written
all over their faces.

05:52.330 --> 05:55.080
Their faces!

05:55.080 --> 05:58.880
Last summer I was working on
facial recognition software
for my slushy machine

05:58.880 --> 06:00.670
to streamline
the ordering process.

06:00.670 --> 06:02.960
I wanted it to digitally
recognize a customer's face

06:02.960 --> 06:05.790
so they could get
their favorite slushy faster.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.750
Can you streamline
the point of this story?

06:07.750 --> 06:09.880
You mean dumb it down for you?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.880
I never disconnected the eye.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.710
There might be a second video
of the robbery!

06:14.710 --> 06:16.290
We have to get down
to the store and check.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.170
Uh, but it's still
an active crime scene.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.170
What if the thieves
come back?

06:20.170 --> 06:23.170
If you're scared,
I'll go by myself.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.920
Seriously?!

06:28.920 --> 06:30.420
I was going to follow you!

06:32.000 --> 06:34.670
This mystery
is spread pretty thick.

06:34.670 --> 06:37.750
And only Marco Peeby
and Frank Jay can get
to the bottom of it.

06:37.750 --> 06:38.880
Yeah.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.880
We have to think
like dirt bags.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.170
They hit our store,
maybe they'll hit
our house next.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.620
It's what I'd do.

06:46.330 --> 06:48.040
Officer Sasha Phluff,

06:48.040 --> 06:50.290
ready to blow this case
wide open.

06:50.290 --> 06:53.290
Slow down. Movie cops
are always partners.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.920
One's all business,
the other's a loose cannon.

06:55.920 --> 07:00.120
Yeah, there's no "all business"
or "loose cannon's"
little sister.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.540
Besides,
we don't work with rookies.

07:02.540 --> 07:03.620
Mm-mm.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.420
I'm not going anywhere.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.960
I've been looking for an excuse

07:06.960 --> 07:09.500
to bring justice
to these streets.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.000
Let's jet, Peeby.
We've got suspects to rattle.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.710
No sense sticking around here
since the new kid
blew our cover.

07:15.710 --> 07:16.710
Mm-hmm.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.040
Blew your cover?

07:22.040 --> 07:24.920
You're in a bright red baby car.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.330
I don't understand why we just
can't just turn the light on.

07:31.330 --> 07:33.120
Because we're not
supposed to be in here.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.960
Besides,
we don't need light.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.380
The place is empty,
it's not like I'm going to--

07:36.380 --> 07:39.790
- Harley!

07:39.790 --> 07:43.580
See, this is why the thieves
didn't want you.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.620
Check it out.

07:47.710 --> 07:50.210
A toothpick.

07:50.210 --> 07:52.380
Just like Rod
is always chewing on.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.960
His are cinnamon.

07:58.330 --> 08:00.120
It's cinnamon!

08:00.120 --> 08:02.830
You realize that was in
a stranger's mouth, right?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.790
Ugh!

08:04.790 --> 08:06.880
Chew on all
the floor toothpicks you want,

08:06.880 --> 08:10.170
they're all just guesses
until we see what
my slushy eye picked up.

08:11.580 --> 08:14.040
- Download complete.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.830
We need to go home and watch
the footage on this thing.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.880
This little drive could have
all the answers we need.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.290
Try not to put it
in your mouth.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.000
Okay, moment of truth.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.790
Okay.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.460
Let's check my slushy feed.

08:34.250 --> 08:37.120
These photos were all taken
in the last 24 hours.

08:38.250 --> 08:43.040
Customer, customer, customer,

08:43.040 --> 08:46.210
Lewie and Beast playing walrus
with the straws,

08:46.210 --> 08:48.000
Dad itching his butt...

08:48.000 --> 08:49.790
Eh, I can see that at home.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.670
Wait. Oh, it doesn't have
night vision capabilities.

08:54.670 --> 08:56.170
We missed the whole robbery!

08:59.170 --> 09:01.040
Officers Peeby and Jay,
reporting for duty.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.380
Sorry we didn't shave,
we pulled a double shift.

09:04.380 --> 09:07.580
The streets don't give up
their answers easy.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.830
Yeah, I had to miss
my kid's T-Ball game,

09:10.830 --> 09:14.040
and I haven't made one
of those all season.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.540
I curse the day
I made those characters.

09:16.540 --> 09:19.210
Anyway, we commandeered
Ethan's camera

09:19.210 --> 09:20.920
and grilled
all the major suspects.

09:20.920 --> 09:25.170
First, Rachel's
slacker ex-boyfriend Cuff.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.080
Still up to
your old tricks, huh?

09:30.080 --> 09:32.330
I've moved on from tagging
kayaks at your dad's place.

09:32.330 --> 09:35.000
I get paid big bucks
as a graffiti artist.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.920
I'm doing a mural right now.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.920
You expect us
to believe people would pay

09:38.920 --> 09:40.880
for unsightly garbage
like this?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.330
Well, actually, the mayor
commissioned me to do it.

09:43.330 --> 09:46.330
Can we get the address
of this "mayor"?

09:48.290 --> 09:51.920
We moved on to
fishing champion Colt Bailey.

09:51.920 --> 09:56.620
Colt, is that you,
or is your twin brother
a filthy drifter?

09:56.620 --> 09:57.830
It's me.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.330
My whole life's gone downhill

09:59.330 --> 10:01.960
since my line got tangled
with the Diaz family.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.250
I ended up losing
that tournament,

10:03.250 --> 10:05.170
I haven't won one since.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.960
Sounds like somebody's
been fishing for cash.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.500
That's why you robbed
the store, isn't it?

10:10.500 --> 10:13.290
You couldn't get me
within 100 yards of that place.

10:13.290 --> 10:15.880
Since I set foot in there,
I lost my mojo,

10:15.880 --> 10:17.880
my endorsements,
even my dog hates me.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.420
Guppy left me for the new
phenom fisherman, Leroy McFly.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.420
I never want to see
that store again.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.960
You catchin' what I'm castin'?

10:26.540 --> 10:29.040
Nice work, guys.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.620
Our last suspect is Rod.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.250
See what you can
find out about him.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.250
Catching human slime
like that

10:34.250 --> 10:36.500
is the reason
I joined the force.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.290
And the policeman's ball,
they pull out all the stops.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.040
Wait, there's more pictures.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.000
It's the next morning.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.540
There's the police.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.920
There's us leaving.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.420
There's Mom and Dad.

10:55.420 --> 10:58.460
Wait. What are they carrying?

10:58.460 --> 11:02.040
What are they doing

11:02.040 --> 11:03.920
Looks like we
just found our lead.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.120
And it leads straight
to our parents!

11:06.120 --> 11:08.290
Hey, guys.

11:08.290 --> 11:09.750
We deserve something fun.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.210
I was thinking
pizza for dinner.

11:11.210 --> 11:14.170
- Great.
- Mmm, pizza.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.960
She's onto us.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.540
We've got to
set up headquarters
in a secure location.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.580
Mom and Dad are suspects?

11:25.580 --> 11:28.620
We just wasted an hour
following Rod around Mega-Mart.

11:28.620 --> 11:33.170
The suspect ate 3 cheese cubes,
17 wasabi peas,

11:33.170 --> 11:35.710
and a cracker with
an undetermined nut butter.

11:35.710 --> 11:37.500
Guys, take a 10-minute
coffee break from that routine.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.170
Ow!

11:39.170 --> 11:43.330
Now, why would Mom and Dad
take the security recorder?

11:43.330 --> 11:46.330
I guess they didn't want anyone
to see what was on it.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.960
Maybe they're
covering something up.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.210
Maybe the store
wasn't robbed at all.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.500
Wait. What if they're tired
of running it and want out?

11:53.500 --> 11:56.670
- You mean, like,
sell the place and move?
- Mm-hmm.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.120
They do hate the cold winters.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.120
Yeah, Mom's always saying

12:00.120 --> 12:01.710
she wants to punch February
in the face.

12:01.710 --> 12:04.040
And kick March
in the slats.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.580
But why wouldn't they
just tell us the truth?

12:06.580 --> 12:09.040
Because they know
we hate the idea of moving.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.380
Remember the one time
they brought it up?

12:11.380 --> 12:14.880
You two chained yourselves
to the bannister.

12:14.880 --> 12:19.170
I bet Mom and Dad
sold all the inventory
to Rod for moving money.

12:19.170 --> 12:22.580
We could be strangers
in a warm town by next week.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.080
We should bust them
right now.

12:27.460 --> 12:31.540
Oh, man,
I wish we weren't
on that coffee break.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.330
They'll just deny everything.

12:33.330 --> 12:35.330
We've got no proof.

12:35.330 --> 12:39.120
All the evidence we need
is on that security recorder.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.880
We need to find out
where they put it.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.790
Whoa!

12:42.790 --> 12:44.880
Have you been lying in there
the whole time?

12:44.880 --> 12:49.040
It's where I was lying before
you should be asking about.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.920
Since I'm the only one
in this department

12:51.920 --> 12:53.670
who has what it takes
for a stakeout,

12:53.670 --> 12:56.040
I've been deep in a series
of under-bed missions.

13:01.250 --> 13:05.250
The evidence
to solve this mystery
is right here in the house.

13:05.250 --> 13:09.250
Only problem,
it's in the hardest
possible place to get into:

13:09.250 --> 13:11.830
Mom and Dad's bedroom closet.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.040
Too much?

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
Maybe not enough.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.250
That closet
is like the Fort Knox
of the Diaz household.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.120
It's where
Mom and Dad keep stuff

13:22.120 --> 13:24.080
they don't want kids touching:

13:24.080 --> 13:28.080
anything breakable, valuable,
sentimental, chocolate...

13:28.080 --> 13:29.620
And now, for some reason,

13:29.620 --> 13:31.170
the Bait and Bite
security recorder.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.920
To make matters worse,

13:32.920 --> 13:35.670
it's the only door in the house
that's locked.

13:35.670 --> 13:38.040
Someone needs to figure out
a plan to get that key.

13:40.540 --> 13:41.960
You mean you, right?

13:41.960 --> 13:42.960
Of course I mean me.

13:42.960 --> 13:43.960
- Okay.
- Oh.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.330
Okay, we've got to get
into Mom and Dad's closet.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.250
To pull it off,
we're going to have to do

13:52.250 --> 13:54.500
something complicated,
dangerous,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.170
and darn near impossible:

13:57.170 --> 13:58.540
work together.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.000
Prepare yourselves
for the Taper Caper.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.120
Okay.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.540
We're going to get that key.

14:07.540 --> 14:10.080
The first part
of the Taper Caper
is distraction.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.120
Hey, Mom. You mind
helping me with my calculus?

14:13.120 --> 14:15.420
We all know Mom loves
showing off her math chops.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.380
Love to.

14:17.380 --> 14:21.000
Did you know that I minored
in accounting in college?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.290
We did.
But what she doesn't know
is that tonight's problem

14:24.290 --> 14:25.830
was taken from the homepage

14:25.830 --> 14:27.960
of the Einstein
Mathematics Society.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.960
That should
keep her occupied

14:29.960 --> 14:32.210
and out of our hair
well past bedtime.

14:32.210 --> 14:35.380
Which frees us up to focus
on target number two.

14:35.380 --> 14:37.210
Dad keeps the keys
to the closet

14:37.210 --> 14:39.920
on the Bait and Bite key chain
attached to his belt loop.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.880
Daddy?

14:41.880 --> 14:46.000
Will you read me
a bedtime story?

14:46.000 --> 14:47.380
Of course I will, pumpkin.

14:47.380 --> 14:48.790
The Daddy's Little Girl
Maneuver,

14:48.790 --> 14:50.290
when deployed correctly,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.670
has a 100% success rate.

14:52.670 --> 14:54.080
So, what are we reading
for nighty night?

14:57.580 --> 15:00.330
The Complete Works
of Edgar Allan Poe.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.460
In that cramped space,

15:04.460 --> 15:07.000
those keys
will get uncomfortable quick.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
That's when we make
our next move.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.210
"But the Raven, sitting
lonely on the placid bust,
spoke only that...

15:14.210 --> 15:15.830
While Dad's
preoccupied with
his marathon story,

15:15.830 --> 15:18.580
Lewie and Beast
will secure the package.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.420
"...not a feather
then he fluttered

15:20.420 --> 15:23.420
till I scarcely more
than muttered..."

15:23.420 --> 15:25.420
And once the package is secure,

15:25.420 --> 15:27.380
that's where
the science comes in.

15:27.380 --> 15:29.250
"...as my hopes
have flown before.

15:29.250 --> 15:31.380
Then the bird said,
"Nevermore.""

15:33.670 --> 15:35.750
And that's how it's done.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.790
Now we're gonna use
the impression in the clay

15:40.790 --> 15:42.250
to make a copy of the key.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.460
This was originally
an ice cream coating,

15:49.460 --> 15:51.250
but it was too hard.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.250
No such thing
as a failed invention...

15:54.250 --> 15:56.380
just one I haven't
figured out yet.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.460
Come to mama, Recorder.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.250
It's 42!
The answer is 42!

16:17.250 --> 16:21.920
Once I realized the problem
was all in respect to
a single variable, voila!

16:21.920 --> 16:24.170
Maybe you should
check your work.

16:24.170 --> 16:28.250
Already did. I've earned myself
some leftover Halloween candy.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.670
The canary has left the cage!

16:47.750 --> 16:49.290
Oh!

16:49.290 --> 16:51.290
Tom, I need the closet key!

16:51.290 --> 16:52.830
Catch!

16:58.710 --> 17:00.830
Come to mama, secret chocolate.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.210
This isn't the bag.

17:10.210 --> 17:12.420
Oh, wait. Yes, it is.

17:14.540 --> 17:15.290
Mmm!

17:16.790 --> 17:17.920
Mmm.

17:24.330 --> 17:27.330
Okay, show time.

17:27.330 --> 17:29.500
Grab your snacks
and hold onto your hats.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.290
This is where we
finally find out the truth.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.500
Huh. This footage
is from the backdoor camera.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.170
Oh, no.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.210
No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:07.080 --> 18:08.380
It was me.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.620
I'm the reason we got robbed.

18:13.460 --> 18:17.250
I-I taped the door
and forgot to undo it.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.880
I left it unlocked.

18:21.420 --> 18:22.670
I think
we've got a confession.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.080
Mom and Dad aren't guilty.

18:29.420 --> 18:30.460
I am.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.620
Uh, but wait...

18:36.620 --> 18:38.790
Why would Mom and Dad
cover it up?

18:38.790 --> 18:40.620
As a person
who messes up a lot,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.830
I know they're not afraid
to point it out and punish.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.620
He's right.

18:45.620 --> 18:49.620
This is so bad,
it's beyond punishment.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.170
I'm such a disappointment,

18:51.170 --> 18:53.170
they don't even know
what to say.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.960
We already figured out
what happened.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.580
Why are you
still in uniform?

19:00.580 --> 19:03.460
We want to be ready
when the next crime breaks out.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.920
They say the first half-hour
is the most important.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.250
We waste that time
getting into costume.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.670
And you?

19:10.670 --> 19:12.540
I think we all know
that these two

19:12.540 --> 19:14.540
aren't solving any crimes.

19:14.540 --> 19:16.080
Have any of you seen Harley?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.580
She's not in her room.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.830
We watched the security footage
last night.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.460
She knows she's the reason
the store got robbed.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.710
Do you guys know
where we can find her?

19:29.880 --> 19:31.380
Harley!

19:32.960 --> 19:35.500
How did you know
she was here?

19:35.500 --> 19:38.250
I did what any good cop
would do...

19:38.250 --> 19:40.290
I played a hunch.

19:40.290 --> 19:41.830
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.330
Harls,
what are you doing?

19:43.330 --> 19:46.420
I'm going to sell
my slushy machine.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.080
It was the only thing
I could think of to help
pay back some of the losses.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.830
But you two just celebrated
your second slushi-versary.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.710
Don't pretend like we all
don't know what I did.

19:55.710 --> 19:58.500
I win the "Worst Diaz" award.

20:01.830 --> 20:04.380
Actually,
I'm a contender.

20:06.670 --> 20:09.830
Remember that time our car
broke down in that snowstorm?

20:09.830 --> 20:12.500
The one where we missed Lewie
and Beast's Christmas pageant?

20:12.500 --> 20:15.500
Only Mom and Dad know,
but that happened because

20:15.500 --> 20:18.420
I borrowed part of the engine
for the set of my racing movie.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.920
Yeah, it's not just him.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.000
Last summer, Beast and I
broke a water main

20:24.000 --> 20:25.500
panning for gold
in the backyard.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.500
We were fools

20:28.500 --> 20:30.290
to buy that treasure map
from Poopy and Goon.

20:30.290 --> 20:31.620
Mm-hmm.

20:31.620 --> 20:34.880
Yeah, I had a big mess up too.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.880
The food spoiled
last Thanksgiving

20:36.880 --> 20:39.880
because the fridge got unplugged
when I broke the centerpiece.

20:39.880 --> 20:43.040
Breaking the centerpiece
doesn't unplug the fridge.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.580
It does when you shove it
behind there with a broom.

20:45.580 --> 20:46.580
Mm.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.620
I can't believe it.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.880
Everyone knew about
this stuff but me?

20:51.880 --> 20:53.880
No, no one knew it.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.670
The same way no one
was going to know that
you left the door unlocked.

20:57.670 --> 21:02.620
Every kid in the family
has at one time
made a huge mistake.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.500
This just happens to be
your first.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.500
We usually talk to them
in private about it,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.290
but you just beat us
to the punch.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.000
Everybody
makes mistakes,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.580
not everybody
needs to know about it.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.210
The day that I made
that dollar,

21:18.210 --> 21:20.500
your mom and I made
so many mistakes,

21:20.500 --> 21:22.790
we were lucky
to stay open.

21:22.790 --> 21:26.080
Mr. President,
may you be the first of many.

21:28.920 --> 21:29.920
Ah.

21:34.170 --> 21:35.290
How about I show you out?

21:37.710 --> 21:38.920
Oh! Oh!

21:42.080 --> 21:44.330
And despite all that,
here we are,

21:44.330 --> 21:47.880
a million mistakes later,
still in business.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.500
So you're saying
it's in our genes?

21:50.500 --> 21:51.500
Deep.

21:53.290 --> 21:55.000
Turns out the biggest mystery

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
is how our family
survived all these years.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.540
♪ Love is the answer ♪

21:58.540 --> 21:59.540

22:01.380 --> 22:02.960

your Sherlock Holmes hats off.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.750
We'll never
figure that one out.

22:05.750 --> 22:09.830
Hey. Celebrating
the good news, huh?

22:09.830 --> 22:11.290
What good news?

22:11.290 --> 22:13.830
They caught the fellas
that robbed your store.

22:13.830 --> 22:17.380
They tried to rob me,
but recently I beefed up
my security.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.580
Oh, you ramped it up
after they hit us?

22:19.580 --> 22:21.380
Nope, I did it because
lately I felt like

22:21.380 --> 22:23.790
