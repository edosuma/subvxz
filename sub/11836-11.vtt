WEBVTT

00:03.336 --> 00:04.738
BERLUTI: I thought
they said 9:00.

00:04.771 --> 00:05.772
YOUNG: They did.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.473
WASHINGTON:
Do we really think

00:07.508 --> 00:08.308
they're going to settle now,

00:08.341 --> 00:09.876
12 hours before we start?

00:09.910 --> 00:11.978
That's when they all settle.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.147
BERLUTI: Maybe we should put
our jackets on.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.148
I read an article,

00:15.181 --> 00:16.449
lawyers look more formidable

00:16.482 --> 00:17.350
in their coats.

00:17.383 --> 00:19.252
Jimmy,
they're coming in here

00:19.285 --> 00:20.921
to either settle or not.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.623
I doubt it'll turn
on whether or not

00:22.656 --> 00:23.456
we're wearing jackets.

00:23.590 --> 00:24.591
(door opens)

00:24.625 --> 00:25.592
They're here.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.193
Show them in.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.296
(door closes)

00:35.636 --> 00:36.637
Sorry we're a little late.

00:36.670 --> 00:37.604
It's okay.

00:38.672 --> 00:39.740
Please.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.385
We're declining
to make an offer.

00:54.354 --> 00:56.289
Any offer?

00:56.322 --> 00:58.124
Look, how you got past
Summary Judgment

00:58.158 --> 00:59.425
still remains a mystery.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.601
The point is, we did.

01:00.634 --> 01:03.003
Eugene, you would have
rejected the number

01:03.036 --> 01:05.305
we were toying with anyway.

01:05.337 --> 01:06.840
But the feeling is that

01:06.873 --> 01:08.141
the precedent of any number

01:08.174 --> 01:10.443
would be exponentially
devastating.

01:10.476 --> 01:12.345
If every problem drinker
starts suing us--

01:12.378 --> 01:14.447
WASHINGTON:
This problem drinker is dead.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.482
Rebecca, it's not that
we don't sympathize.

01:16.517 --> 01:17.618
WASHINGTON: You just
won't cough up a nickel.

01:17.651 --> 01:19.119
Look me in the eye
and tell me

01:19.152 --> 01:21.154
that you would advise
my client to settle here.

01:21.187 --> 01:22.723
All right, look,

01:22.756 --> 01:25.225
you came all the way over here
at 9:30 at night,

01:25.258 --> 01:26.693
is there room for negotiation

01:26.727 --> 01:28.995
or are you just messengers
for bad news?

01:29.029 --> 01:30.631
The latter.

01:32.232 --> 01:34.735
$125,000, sealed,

01:34.768 --> 01:36.202
no admission of liability.

01:36.236 --> 01:37.704
We can't on principle.

01:37.738 --> 01:39.506
This was a kid.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.041
He died of alcoholism.

01:41.074 --> 01:43.443
Your client bears
some responsibility,

01:43.476 --> 01:45.178
and you won't take it
on principle?

01:45.211 --> 01:48.682
Okay, look, this need not
to get ugly.

01:48.715 --> 01:50.116
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:50.150 --> 01:52.819
Do the research on us, Mark,
would you?

01:52.853 --> 01:53.854
Meaning?

01:53.887 --> 01:56.389
When we try cases,

01:56.422 --> 01:58.058
it gets ugly.

01:58.091 --> 01:59.425
Eugene, this isn't criminal.

01:59.459 --> 02:01.167
This is a civil case.

02:01.201 --> 02:03.069
Lawyers tend to be--

02:03.103 --> 02:04.738
what's the word?

02:04.771 --> 02:06.306
Civil.

02:12.513 --> 02:14.781
I don't think you scared them.

02:18.351 --> 02:21.287
(music playing)

03:07.007 --> 03:09.375
JOSHUA: He began to have
a problem in high school

03:09.409 --> 03:10.143
in his senior year.

03:10.176 --> 03:11.845
BERLUTI:
A drinking problem?

03:11.878 --> 03:13.479
JOSHUA: Yes, I mean,
it wasn't that he was

03:13.514 --> 03:15.081
terribly into parties.

03:15.115 --> 03:17.150
Michael was an athlete.

03:17.183 --> 03:18.451
But it started with beer

03:18.484 --> 03:21.788
and it sort of shifted
into hard alcohol.

03:21.822 --> 03:22.956
His mother and I got him

03:22.989 --> 03:24.591
into a treatment program.

03:24.625 --> 03:25.992
Was this successful?

03:26.026 --> 03:28.762
Yes, for a year or two.

03:28.795 --> 03:31.097
But then in college,

03:31.131 --> 03:32.332
he got into the frat scene.

03:32.365 --> 03:34.167
There was, uh...

03:34.200 --> 03:35.468
What happened?

03:35.502 --> 03:36.302
JOSHUA:
His grades suffered.

03:36.336 --> 03:38.238
He didn't graduate.

03:38.271 --> 03:40.541
His friends abandoned him.

03:40.574 --> 03:43.309
We did an intervention
in 1999.

03:43.343 --> 03:46.312
In April 2000,
he was released.

03:46.346 --> 03:48.148
He spiraled down from there.

03:48.181 --> 03:51.552
He was living on the streets.

03:51.585 --> 03:53.086
He died of alcohol poisoning

03:53.119 --> 03:54.087
that spring.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.923
And you're blaming
Portiss Brewery

03:56.957 --> 03:58.291
for your son's death?

03:58.324 --> 04:00.501
He primarily drank
their beer

04:00.534 --> 04:01.535
in high school.

04:01.568 --> 04:03.637
I'm certainly aware that
there were other beers,

04:03.670 --> 04:05.706
but for the most part,

04:05.739 --> 04:07.040
it was Portiss.

04:07.073 --> 04:08.975
Did he have other difficulties?

04:09.009 --> 04:10.043
None.

04:10.076 --> 04:11.311
Michael was an athlete.

04:11.344 --> 04:12.779
He admired athletes.

04:12.813 --> 04:14.715
He watched all those
beer commercials

04:14.748 --> 04:16.382
they run during the games.

04:16.416 --> 04:18.017
He saw his favorite
ballplayers

04:18.051 --> 04:19.553
endorsing Portiss
and other beers

04:19.586 --> 04:21.321
like they were
nutrition drinks.

04:21.353 --> 04:23.156
These companies
targeted my son

04:23.189 --> 04:24.324
and other young kids.

04:24.357 --> 04:25.659
Drinking is cool.

04:25.692 --> 04:27.628
Drinking will get you girls.

04:29.162 --> 04:31.297
Well, it is not cool.

04:31.331 --> 04:34.167
Drinking killed my son.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.035
Is it your testimony, sir,

04:36.069 --> 04:37.637
your son thought beer

04:37.671 --> 04:38.905
was a nutritional drink

04:38.938 --> 04:40.173
when he began consuming it?

04:40.206 --> 04:42.142
That question reflects
the very arrogance

04:42.175 --> 04:42.943
of your client,

04:42.976 --> 04:44.678
who refuses
to take responsibility

04:44.711 --> 04:47.080
for contributing
to a young man's death.

04:47.113 --> 04:50.584
Do you take any
responsibility, Mr. Berry?

04:50.617 --> 04:53.720
Your son was underage,

04:53.754 --> 04:54.755
drinking illegally.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.925
Let me ask you,
do you drink?

04:58.959 --> 05:00.501
In moderation.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.568
Responsibly?

05:01.602 --> 05:02.569
Yes.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.738
GRUNDEL: Your son
was raised in a household

05:04.771 --> 05:06.439
where his parents
drank moderately

05:06.472 --> 05:07.608
and responsibly?

05:07.641 --> 05:09.042
Yes.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.577
And when your son entered

05:10.611 --> 05:11.578
his high school years,

05:11.612 --> 05:13.246
did you ever talk to your son

05:13.279 --> 05:14.915
about the dangers of drinking?

05:14.948 --> 05:16.082
Many times.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.484
You feel you adequately
informed him

05:18.519 --> 05:19.686
as to all of the risks?

05:19.720 --> 05:22.255
Look, no matter
what parents say,

05:22.288 --> 05:24.991
it is hard to compete
with the images of fun

05:25.025 --> 05:26.092
and social acceptance

05:26.126 --> 05:26.993
that is being marketed

05:27.027 --> 05:28.494
by the alcohol industry.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.030
GRUNDEL: My question is,

05:30.063 --> 05:31.532
do you feel you adequately

05:31.565 --> 05:32.999
informed your son

05:33.033 --> 05:35.001
as to the potential risks

05:35.035 --> 05:37.504
of consuming alcohol?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.405
Yes.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.407
Thank you, sir.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.710
And I'm very sorry
for your loss.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.987
I thought alcohol companies

05:54.020 --> 05:55.656
were exempt
from these lawsuits.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.990
No one is exempt
from fraud.

05:57.023 --> 05:57.958
They lie when they say

05:57.991 --> 05:59.292
they don't market to kids.

06:01.001 --> 06:01.802
HATCHER:
Can I help you?

06:01.835 --> 06:04.104
Yes, I'm looking
for Ellenor Frutt.

06:04.137 --> 06:05.606
I'm Ellenor Frutt.

06:05.639 --> 06:08.842
Hello, my name
is Stephen Marshall.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.476
I'd like to hire you.

06:10.511 --> 06:12.145
Is there someplace
we can talk?

06:14.314 --> 06:15.849
(door opens)

06:18.519 --> 06:19.686
(door closes)

06:21.387 --> 06:24.290
I guess I should just
get right to it.

06:24.324 --> 06:26.960
I'm the warden of Goffstown
Correctional facility

06:26.993 --> 06:28.361
in New Hampshire.

06:28.394 --> 06:30.496
One of my inmates
is Denise Freeman.

06:30.531 --> 06:32.432
She shot two young boys

06:32.465 --> 06:34.935
who were playing
in the park.

06:34.968 --> 06:37.571
She's scheduled to be
executed next week.

06:37.604 --> 06:39.405
It's the first execution
in New Hampshire

06:39.439 --> 06:40.273
in many years.

06:40.306 --> 06:42.275
So, maybe you read about it.

06:42.308 --> 06:44.010
I hadn't actually.

06:44.044 --> 06:44.945
How can I help?

06:44.978 --> 06:46.980
I'd like you to stop it.

06:47.013 --> 06:48.715
Her execution?

06:48.749 --> 06:50.283
Yes.

06:50.316 --> 06:51.785
I read where you got
a death sentence

06:51.818 --> 06:54.588
overturned several years ago.

06:54.621 --> 06:56.089
I drove down here on the chance

06:56.122 --> 06:58.358
that you could possibly
work your magic again.

06:59.425 --> 07:01.535
You're the warden
trying to halt

07:01.568 --> 07:02.569
the execution.

07:02.603 --> 07:04.237
Yes.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.206
Are you against
the death penalty?

07:06.239 --> 07:07.808
No, not at all. No.

07:07.841 --> 07:11.578
In fact, I think we should
employ it more often.

07:11.612 --> 07:14.715
But we shouldn't be killing
Denise Freeman.

07:14.748 --> 07:15.949
She's not the same person

07:15.982 --> 07:18.218
who committed those crimes.

07:18.251 --> 07:19.152
I know they all claim that,

07:19.185 --> 07:21.021
but she really isn't.

07:23.389 --> 07:25.458
That's why I drove down here

07:25.491 --> 07:27.393
to convince you to help save

07:27.427 --> 07:29.596
an extraordinary woman.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.135
Oh, don't you even dare.

07:35.168 --> 07:36.169
This is Sheila Berry.

07:36.202 --> 07:38.271
<i>She was just awarded</i>
<i>"Sister of the year."</i>

07:38.304 --> 07:40.073
Shut up!
North America only.

07:40.106 --> 07:41.742
She competes for world
"Sister of the year"

07:41.775 --> 07:42.943
next month.
Yeah, and I score

07:42.976 --> 07:43.910
special endurance points

07:43.944 --> 07:45.712
for having you
as my little brother.

07:45.746 --> 07:46.947
Let me tell you
a little bit about Sheila.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.281
Let's not.
She makes up her own words

07:48.314 --> 07:49.049
playing scrabble.

07:49.082 --> 07:51.084
She--
No, I don't.

07:55.556 --> 07:56.690
That was your brother,
Michael?

07:56.723 --> 07:57.924
Yes.

07:57.958 --> 08:01.401
Does that video fairly
reflect his personality?

08:01.434 --> 08:03.269
He had an amazing
sense of humor.

08:03.303 --> 08:06.439
He was shy. You don't get that
from the video.

08:06.472 --> 08:07.273
He was very shy.

08:07.307 --> 08:08.341
I think that was one
of the reasons

08:08.374 --> 08:10.611
he drank at parties.

08:10.644 --> 08:12.679
Socially, he was
a little uncomfortable

08:12.713 --> 08:14.548
until he got
to know people.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.550
When was the last time

08:16.583 --> 08:18.218
you saw your brother?

08:18.251 --> 08:20.286
About a month
before he died.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.755
Where did you see him?

08:21.788 --> 08:23.924
My apartment.

08:23.957 --> 08:26.492
He came...

08:26.527 --> 08:28.529
to ask me for money.

08:28.562 --> 08:31.331
He was living
on the streets.

08:31.364 --> 08:32.899
Did you loan him money?

08:32.933 --> 08:34.934
I told him he could
move in with me

08:34.967 --> 08:36.503
if he wanted to,

08:36.537 --> 08:38.004
but I wasn't gonna
give him money

08:38.038 --> 08:39.940
so he could just go
buy liquor.

08:41.674 --> 08:44.210
I begged him to get help

08:45.579 --> 08:47.380
but he just walked away.

08:50.817 --> 08:53.019
That was the last time
I ever saw him.

08:53.053 --> 08:55.488
I have nothing further.

09:07.107 --> 09:08.542
No questions, Your Honor.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.749
It isn't exactly
great timing for us

09:15.849 --> 09:17.684
to be taking
a pro bono case.

09:17.718 --> 09:20.120
I'm not saying I definitely
want to take it on,

09:20.153 --> 09:22.523
but...

09:22.556 --> 09:24.157
I'd like to meet with her,

09:24.190 --> 09:26.326
see who she is, what she is.

09:26.359 --> 09:27.794
She's in New Hampshire?

09:27.828 --> 09:28.962
Yes.

09:28.995 --> 09:29.730
I thought I would
drive up there

09:29.763 --> 09:31.064
with Jamie this afternoon.

09:31.097 --> 09:33.534
Evidently, she runs this
"Talk straight" program

09:33.567 --> 09:35.168
for troubled kids that...

09:36.803 --> 09:39.439
the warden came here
personally.

09:39.472 --> 09:41.341
I really think I should go.

09:41.374 --> 09:44.578
I'll say yes
with one word of caution,

09:44.611 --> 09:46.046
protect yourself.

09:46.079 --> 09:47.681
I'm sure there'll
either be a guard

09:47.714 --> 09:49.249
or a partition or--

09:49.282 --> 09:51.518
I'm not talking
physically.

09:51.552 --> 09:53.119
You're about
to emotionally invest

09:53.153 --> 09:54.855
in somebody who, odds are,

09:54.888 --> 09:57.558
will be dead in a week.

09:57.591 --> 09:59.560
I won't invest emotionally.

09:59.593 --> 10:00.534
Right.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.369
Protect yourself.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.146
BLOOMBERG: The cause of death
was alcohol poisoning.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.749
Doctor, Michael Berry
went in and out

10:15.782 --> 10:17.951
of many treatment programs.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.185
Why couldn't he be cured?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.121
Because he was addicted.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.356
You mean, he lacked
the will to stop?

10:23.389 --> 10:25.425
BLOOMBERG:
That oversimplifies it.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.027
People think alcoholics

10:27.060 --> 10:27.961
lack willpower.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.495
I wish it were that easy.

10:29.530 --> 10:32.032
The brain chemistry
is changed.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.967
Telling a severely
impaired alcoholic

10:34.000 --> 10:35.802
not to drink
is like telling someone

10:35.836 --> 10:37.538
not to go to the bathroom.

10:37.571 --> 10:40.306
We're talking about
an overwhelming urge

10:40.340 --> 10:42.142
related to a bodily function.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.610
Come on, doctor,
it's not like

10:43.644 --> 10:45.078
he had no choice here.

10:45.111 --> 10:46.847
He chose
to drink initially.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.881
BLOOMBERG: Of course he did,

10:47.914 --> 10:49.215
like smokers choose to smoke,

10:49.249 --> 10:51.151
like people choose
to use cocaine.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.486
But once the addiction
took hold,

10:53.520 --> 10:56.322
he was robbed
of his free will.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.992
That kid was dying
on the street,

10:59.025 --> 11:00.767
homeless, for God's sake.

11:00.801 --> 11:04.404
Does anybody think
he chose that?

11:04.437 --> 11:07.073
GRUNDEL: Many alcoholics
do recover.

11:07.107 --> 11:09.109
As do many smokers.

11:09.142 --> 11:11.512
That doesn't mean
the addiction's not real.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.546
But, doctor,
you make it sound like

11:12.579 --> 11:14.480
an involuntary affliction,

11:14.515 --> 11:15.982
when, in fact, as you--
I make it sound like

11:16.016 --> 11:17.784
a disease, Counsel.

11:17.818 --> 11:19.853
The very definition
of disease

11:19.886 --> 11:21.988
is an involuntary disability,

11:22.022 --> 11:23.724
which Michael Berry had.

11:23.757 --> 11:25.692
May I be allowed
to finish my questions?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.561
BLOOMBERG: You may,
but if you wrongfully

11:27.594 --> 11:29.996
restate my answers,
I'll interrupt.

11:30.030 --> 11:32.799
WEEKS: Doctor,
this isn't a rugby match.

11:34.267 --> 11:35.569
GRUNDEL:
What is the likelihood

11:35.602 --> 11:37.504
if one drinks moderately

11:37.538 --> 11:39.940
that he or she will become
addicted to alcohol?

11:39.973 --> 11:41.107
I can't answer that.

11:41.141 --> 11:42.475
No one can.

11:42.509 --> 11:44.545
Alcohol affects people
differently.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.112
We need to do more studies,

11:46.146 --> 11:47.147
which they haven't done.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.449
GRUNDEL:
In your experience,

11:49.482 --> 11:51.417
if someone
drinks moderately,

11:51.451 --> 11:52.285
how likely is it--

11:52.318 --> 11:54.287
It's extremely likely
that young kids

11:54.320 --> 11:55.989
won't drink moderately--

11:56.022 --> 11:57.924
If a person
drinks responsibly

11:57.958 --> 11:58.992
in moderation,

11:59.025 --> 12:00.801
he or she is not likely

12:00.834 --> 12:03.269
to become addicted.

12:03.303 --> 12:05.071
That would be fair.

12:06.172 --> 12:07.508
Thank you.

12:21.955 --> 12:24.658
I need you to look
at me, Janice.

12:32.799 --> 12:36.703
You see, we're on a bit
of a time crunch here.

12:36.737 --> 12:39.372
I'm scheduled to be killed
next week.

12:39.405 --> 12:40.507
If I'm gonna help you,

12:40.541 --> 12:42.943
I need to make fast progress.

12:44.745 --> 12:46.747
Now, how about we...

12:46.780 --> 12:49.049
let that anger give way
to greed, then?

12:49.082 --> 12:51.117
You will probably be
the last person

12:51.151 --> 12:53.386
who gets to talk to me.

12:53.419 --> 12:55.255
You could write an article,

12:55.288 --> 12:57.591
get paid for it.

12:57.624 --> 12:59.025
Lots of good things
could come from you

12:59.059 --> 13:00.867
talking to me.

13:00.901 --> 13:02.035
Janice...

13:02.068 --> 13:05.371
it all starts with your eyes

13:05.405 --> 13:07.641
finding mine.

13:15.348 --> 13:16.583
MARSHALL: I can't tell you
how many kids

13:16.617 --> 13:18.484
whose lives she's rerouted.

13:19.853 --> 13:22.355
She connects
with every single one, too.

13:22.388 --> 13:23.389
She'll get to this one, too.

13:23.423 --> 13:24.357
You watch.

13:24.390 --> 13:26.392
All the appeals
are exhausted?

13:26.426 --> 13:28.194
MARSHALL: Every one.

13:28.228 --> 13:30.030
There's a petition
for a stay

13:30.063 --> 13:31.732
with the Supreme Court,

13:31.765 --> 13:33.634
but that's not going
to happen.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.102
Look, as I said,

13:36.136 --> 13:38.438
I'm pro-death penalty,

13:38.471 --> 13:39.806
but this one,

13:41.842 --> 13:43.744
she's something.

13:43.777 --> 13:47.447
The problem is that
I am also a murderer.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.250
At least, I was before
I got on the medication.

13:51.718 --> 13:53.520
I shot a 13-year-old boy

13:53.554 --> 13:55.221
playing on a jungle gym,

13:55.255 --> 13:57.457
and then I pointed the gun

13:57.490 --> 14:00.567
and shot his
11-year-old brother.

14:00.601 --> 14:02.002
I was every bit the monster

14:02.035 --> 14:03.570
the prosecution
made me out to be.

14:03.604 --> 14:05.539
You need to be clear
about that.

14:05.572 --> 14:07.674
You mentioned medication.

14:07.708 --> 14:08.742
What medication?

14:08.775 --> 14:10.744
I've been on
a psychotropic cocktail

14:10.777 --> 14:12.613
for the last eight years.

14:12.646 --> 14:15.448
And before you took it?

14:15.481 --> 14:16.950
Monster.

14:16.983 --> 14:19.319
You weren't listening.

14:19.352 --> 14:21.254
FRUTT: Did you argue
diminished capacity

14:21.287 --> 14:22.656
at the trial?

14:22.689 --> 14:26.092
Yes, it failed.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.327
The jury saw me sane

14:27.360 --> 14:30.130
since I was medicated
for the trial, also.

14:30.163 --> 14:31.832
Forced?

14:31.865 --> 14:33.233
Sorry?

14:33.266 --> 14:34.367
The medication
you took for the trial

14:34.400 --> 14:35.401
was it forced?

14:35.435 --> 14:36.670
Well it had to be,

14:36.703 --> 14:38.972
I had no capacity to consent.

14:39.005 --> 14:39.940
Why?

14:39.973 --> 14:43.243
I'm just searching
for an angle.

14:43.276 --> 14:46.079
Well, the insanity
one's been tried.

14:46.112 --> 14:48.682
We need to come up
with something else.

14:48.715 --> 14:51.151
FRUTT: You seem...

14:51.184 --> 14:54.187
well, most death-row inmates

14:54.220 --> 14:56.356
have a little
desperation going,

14:56.389 --> 14:58.091
especially as the day
gets closer.

14:58.124 --> 15:00.767
Is there a way
you want me to act?

15:00.801 --> 15:03.804
No, but...

15:03.837 --> 15:05.972
FREEMAN: You know,
the funny thing is,

15:06.006 --> 15:09.242
there's a calm
that comes with it.

15:09.275 --> 15:12.679
Actually
I'm a prolific worrier.

15:12.713 --> 15:15.716
But now, you know,

15:15.749 --> 15:18.484
I'm not afraid
of getting cancer,

15:18.519 --> 15:20.721
financial security,

15:20.754 --> 15:22.556
problems in the Middle East.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.358
None of that gets to me.

15:25.391 --> 15:26.760
I--I'm gonna be dead
in a week.

15:28.662 --> 15:31.898
There's a calm that comes.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.134
(scoffs)

15:34.167 --> 15:35.936
Underneath the cool.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.007
I'm gonna be dead in a week.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.108
Do I really need to make

15:42.142 --> 15:44.177
a showing of desperation?

15:49.349 --> 15:50.817
PICKFORD: Alcohol addiction

15:50.851 --> 15:52.919
is both genetic and social.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.087
Some of the predisposition

15:54.120 --> 15:56.389
is in the brain chemistry.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.324
Some of it obviously
is environmental,

15:58.358 --> 15:59.726
how a person lives.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.201
But, doctor,

16:01.234 --> 16:03.136
my question is,

16:03.169 --> 16:05.271
is it possible a person

16:05.305 --> 16:07.173
can become addicted
to alcohol

16:07.207 --> 16:09.610
without drinking
excessively?

16:09.643 --> 16:11.177
We have not proven it,

16:11.211 --> 16:12.513
but my opinion is

16:12.546 --> 16:14.114
it's absolutely possible.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.448
How?

16:15.481 --> 16:18.785
Well, the limbic system
in the brain

16:18.819 --> 16:19.986
is very different in people

16:20.020 --> 16:21.555
who suffer from alcoholism.

16:21.588 --> 16:22.789
How do we know this?

16:22.823 --> 16:24.858
Autopsies.

16:24.891 --> 16:27.193
Problem is, we can't be sure
what came first.

16:27.227 --> 16:29.863
Is it the alcoholism
that altered the brain

16:29.896 --> 16:32.933
or is it the abnormal brain

16:32.966 --> 16:35.335
that caused the alcoholism?

16:35.368 --> 16:36.537
It may very well be

16:36.570 --> 16:38.805
that many people
are born alcoholics

16:38.839 --> 16:40.406
waiting to happen.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.777
Michael Berry
could have been one of them.

16:43.810 --> 16:45.546
Have you found
a single person

16:45.579 --> 16:47.113
who became an alcoholic

16:47.147 --> 16:48.882
who didn't drink
excessively?

16:48.915 --> 16:51.518
No, but the reason
he drank heavily

16:51.552 --> 16:53.754
could be the genetic makeup
of his brain.

16:53.787 --> 16:55.756
That's what people don't get.

16:55.789 --> 16:57.691
Did you study the brain
of Michael Berry?

16:57.724 --> 16:59.593
No, because no autopsy
was ever done.

16:59.626 --> 17:02.903
So you have no idea
as to the genetic makeup

17:02.936 --> 17:03.837
of the plaintiff?

17:03.870 --> 17:05.672
That's correct.

17:14.047 --> 17:16.215
(knocks on door)

17:16.249 --> 17:17.584
Hey.

17:17.617 --> 17:18.318
How's it going?

17:18.351 --> 17:20.654
So far, so good.

17:20.686 --> 17:22.255
The case is still
a long shot,

17:22.288 --> 17:24.958
but we'll see.

17:29.062 --> 17:30.163
Your brother?

17:30.196 --> 17:32.699
Yeah.

17:32.733 --> 17:34.701
Hard to believe,
almost nine years

17:34.735 --> 17:35.902
since he died.

17:37.771 --> 17:40.541
He was an alcoholic.

17:40.574 --> 17:41.708
Is that in play at all?

17:44.277 --> 17:46.379
Did you come in to check
on the case or me?

17:46.412 --> 17:48.248
I know you fully appreciate

17:48.281 --> 17:49.583
the difficulty of the case.

17:49.616 --> 17:51.585
I do wonder whether
that appreciation

17:51.618 --> 17:53.419
could get blurred

17:53.453 --> 17:56.122
by a sense of...

17:56.156 --> 17:57.390
mission.

17:57.423 --> 17:59.793
I'm not on a mission.

17:59.826 --> 18:01.467
Did alcohol
help kill my brother?

18:01.502 --> 18:04.437
Yes, but that hardly puts me
in a small group.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.272
Half the adult population
in this country

18:06.306 --> 18:07.708
has alcoholism
in their family.

18:07.741 --> 18:09.475
That's a point worth arguing.

18:09.510 --> 18:12.112
I plan to!

18:12.145 --> 18:13.580
Eugene, I feel like
it's getting harder

18:13.614 --> 18:14.681
and harder for you and me

18:14.715 --> 18:16.316
just to have a conversation.

18:16.349 --> 18:18.118
Bobby, you didn't
come in here to have

18:18.151 --> 18:19.152
a conversation.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.387
You came in here worried
about my objectivity

18:21.421 --> 18:23.524
because of how my brother...

18:27.828 --> 18:29.896
Like you say,

18:29.930 --> 18:31.397
I have a full appreciation

18:31.431 --> 18:33.366
of the difficulty of the case,

18:33.399 --> 18:34.768
and if an offer does come in,

18:34.801 --> 18:37.370
I'll recommend settlement
to the client.

18:37.403 --> 18:39.272
Okay.

18:48.715 --> 18:49.716
(door closes)

18:54.154 --> 18:55.956
FREEMAN: I think
the biggest problem

18:55.989 --> 18:58.024
with my insanity defense
was that

18:58.058 --> 19:00.333
it played
so stereotypically.

19:00.366 --> 19:01.968
I heard voices.

19:02.002 --> 19:03.837
I thought they were
a mandate from God.

19:03.870 --> 19:05.138
You know,
there's somebody like me

19:05.171 --> 19:06.973
on Dateline once a week.

19:07.007 --> 19:08.542
I think the jury just went,

19:08.575 --> 19:11.344
"Yeah, yeah, next."

19:11.377 --> 19:13.146
And the actual diagnosis?

19:13.179 --> 19:16.717
Paranoid schizophrenia.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.552
Do you have a memory
of the killings?

19:20.320 --> 19:22.388
They haven't found
the medication yet

19:22.422 --> 19:24.057
to erase memory.

19:24.090 --> 19:26.560
Can you tell me
what you remember?

19:28.595 --> 19:30.997
Can you tell me
how that's relevant?

19:31.031 --> 19:32.132
Denise...

19:33.266 --> 19:35.602
as you said to that young girl,

19:35.636 --> 19:38.004
we're a little crunched
for time.

19:38.038 --> 19:40.607
So I need you
to let me be the lawyer

19:40.641 --> 19:42.976
and trust me to decide

19:43.009 --> 19:44.477
what's relevant.

19:44.511 --> 19:47.280
If the memory's vivid,
I want to know.

19:47.313 --> 19:50.684
If not, I want
to know that, too.

19:50.717 --> 19:52.653
Tell me what you remember.

19:57.290 --> 20:00.934
In the moment,
time slowed down.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.770
I saw the bullets travel.

20:06.106 --> 20:08.041
I saw them floating
through the air

20:08.074 --> 20:09.510
like feathers.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.947
They hit the skulls.

20:15.448 --> 20:19.119
Two incredibly
sweet little boys.

20:21.154 --> 20:24.157
These floating feathers

20:24.190 --> 20:26.259
just made their heads go

20:26.292 --> 20:29.696
(imitates explosion).

20:34.500 --> 20:36.069
That vivid enough?

20:47.147 --> 20:48.849
Alcoholism is something

20:48.882 --> 20:50.651
we all need
to be concerned with,

20:50.684 --> 20:52.185
and we are at Portiss.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.087
I guess the question becomes,

20:54.120 --> 20:56.289
how do you manifest
that concern?

20:56.322 --> 20:58.725
CARROLL: First,
by putting warnings

20:58.759 --> 21:00.834
on every single
one of our products.

21:00.867 --> 21:02.335
But I'll tell you something,

21:02.368 --> 21:04.004
we probably should do

21:04.037 --> 21:05.606
a better job of publicizing

21:05.639 --> 21:07.107
the health benefits.

21:07.140 --> 21:07.874
The benefits?

21:07.908 --> 21:09.309
CARROLL: Absolutely.

21:09.342 --> 21:11.678
Studies now show
that having a drink or two

21:11.712 --> 21:13.146
of alcohol every day

21:13.179 --> 21:14.848
can help fight
heart disease.

21:14.881 --> 21:16.116
Evidence is now coming in

21:16.149 --> 21:17.884
that it can even promote
mental health

21:17.918 --> 21:20.220
and possibly prevent
Alzheimer's.

21:20.253 --> 21:22.889
Some doctors are recommending
to their patients

21:22.923 --> 21:25.626
that they consume moderate
amounts of alcohol

21:25.659 --> 21:27.060
to promote general health,

21:27.093 --> 21:28.361
well-being, and longevity.

21:28.394 --> 21:30.130
Is the defendant testifying

21:30.163 --> 21:30.864
in the narrative?

21:30.897 --> 21:32.165
Mr. Carroll,

21:32.198 --> 21:33.967
a young man died here.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.301
And it's a tragedy.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.638
My heart goes out
to his family.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.939
I had a nephew who was killed

21:38.972 --> 21:39.973
by a drunk driver,

21:40.006 --> 21:42.342
and I'm angry about it
to this day.

21:42.375 --> 21:43.644
But I'll tell you,

21:43.677 --> 21:45.211
this country as a whole

21:45.245 --> 21:47.480
is vigilant about this.

21:47.514 --> 21:49.583
We have mothers
against drunk drivers.

21:49.616 --> 21:52.919
We have PSAs
on every channel.

21:52.953 --> 21:54.320
In our own advertisements,

21:54.354 --> 21:56.322
we warn about drinking
and driving.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.224
This isn't some obscure,

21:58.258 --> 22:00.233
latent peril lurking
in the bushes.

22:00.266 --> 22:03.403
The message on irresponsible
drinking is out there,

22:03.436 --> 22:05.972
and it's been out there
for many, many years.

22:06.006 --> 22:07.407
Our industry...

22:07.440 --> 22:09.543
has spent millions of dollars
on that message.

22:09.576 --> 22:11.344
And I'll tell you
something else

22:11.377 --> 22:13.446
the majority
of Americans get it.

22:13.479 --> 22:14.515
Objection!

22:14.548 --> 22:16.817
Mr. Grundel, you need
to ask your client a question.

22:16.850 --> 22:19.185
He only need respond
to that question.

22:19.219 --> 22:21.788
Mr. Carroll,
what about the specific problem

22:21.822 --> 22:23.724
of underage drinking?

22:23.757 --> 22:26.593
We fund numerous
educational awareness programs

22:26.627 --> 22:28.562
more than
any other industry.

22:28.595 --> 22:32.465
We pay to train vendors
not to sell to kids.

22:32.498 --> 22:34.601
We agree with the law
which raises

22:34.635 --> 22:37.003
the legal drinking age
from 18 to 21.

22:37.037 --> 22:38.705
And let's think about that.

22:38.739 --> 22:41.407
You can vote,
you can fight in a war,

22:41.441 --> 22:43.677
you're considered an adult
for the purpose of the law

22:43.710 --> 22:47.213
in every single way
at the age of 18

22:47.247 --> 22:48.148
and we still say,

22:48.181 --> 22:50.283
"Whoa. We're gonna
make you wait

22:50.316 --> 22:52.485
an additional three years

22:52.519 --> 22:54.187
before you can drink."

22:54.220 --> 22:55.722
Why?

22:55.756 --> 22:58.091
Because we recognize the need

22:58.124 --> 23:01.835
for maturity
and responsibility.

23:01.868 --> 23:03.504
In fact, the only thing
left for us to do

23:03.537 --> 23:06.272
would be to ban
alcohol altogether.

23:07.608 --> 23:08.875
We tried that
in this country once

23:08.909 --> 23:10.376
and it didn't work.

23:11.878 --> 23:13.580
DONNELL:
Run that by me again.

23:13.614 --> 23:15.549
FRUTT: It's not
as crazy as it sounds.

23:15.582 --> 23:18.284
DONNELL: Just the same,
once more.

23:18.318 --> 23:19.720
Okay.

23:19.753 --> 23:21.187
She stops taking the meds,

23:21.221 --> 23:23.089
in which case
she regresses quickly,

23:23.123 --> 23:25.158
I might add,
according to the doctors.

23:25.191 --> 23:27.594
Once she becomes
schizophrenic again,

23:27.628 --> 23:29.596
we get the diagnosis
of insanity.

23:29.630 --> 23:31.598
Supreme Court
has expressly held

23:31.632 --> 23:34.134
the Eighth Amendment
prohibits executing the insane.

23:34.167 --> 23:36.069
They also held
you can force-medicate

23:36.102 --> 23:37.470
to make a person sane.

23:37.504 --> 23:39.540
STRINGER: They upheld
forced medication

23:39.573 --> 23:42.075
to make a defendant
competent for trial.

23:42.108 --> 23:43.944
Not necessarily
for punishment.

23:45.278 --> 23:48.314
FRUTT: Bobby, I can't think
of anything else.

23:48.348 --> 23:49.850
You want to
take her off the meds?

23:49.883 --> 23:52.218
FRUTT: And try
and stop the execution

23:52.252 --> 23:54.988
on the grounds
that she's insane.

23:55.021 --> 23:57.891
At a minimum,
it could buy us time.

23:57.924 --> 23:59.392
The death penalty
is vulnerable.

23:59.425 --> 24:01.434
Time is time.

24:02.569 --> 24:04.137
What do we have to lose?

24:08.274 --> 24:10.443
YOUNG: How much money
does the alcohol industry

24:10.476 --> 24:11.612
make per year?

24:11.645 --> 24:12.679
A lot.

24:12.713 --> 24:14.380
You're a major manufacturer.

24:14.414 --> 24:16.316
I'm sure you can get
more specific

24:16.349 --> 24:18.519
than "a lot,"
can't you, Mr. Carroll?

24:18.552 --> 24:19.753
It's in the billions.

24:19.786 --> 24:23.256
It's close
to $120 billion a year,

24:23.289 --> 24:26.192
$120 billion.

24:26.226 --> 24:27.961
Which contributes to a healthier

24:27.994 --> 24:29.262
U.S. economy, Mr. Young,

24:29.295 --> 24:31.998
and employs hundreds
of thousands of Americans.

24:32.032 --> 24:34.735
Thank you for that.

24:34.768 --> 24:36.202
And how much money
does your company

24:36.236 --> 24:38.371
spend to build or contribute

24:38.404 --> 24:41.241
to treatment facilities
for alcohol abuse?

24:41.274 --> 24:42.475
We make beer, Mr. Young.

24:42.509 --> 24:44.410
We're not
in the hospital business.

24:44.444 --> 24:45.679
The answer is zero?

24:45.712 --> 24:46.813
CARROLL: No, it is not.

24:46.847 --> 24:49.683
We donate a great deal of money
to prevention programs.

24:49.716 --> 24:52.418
A great deal?
More or less than 1%

24:52.452 --> 24:54.855
of what you spend
promoting alcohol use?

24:54.888 --> 24:56.523
Hey, since it's voluntary--

24:56.557 --> 24:57.457
Less than 1%?

24:57.490 --> 24:58.859
I'd have
to check the figures.

24:58.892 --> 25:01.968
Well, I have some figures.

25:02.002 --> 25:05.606
Your industry takes in a hundred
and twenty billion a year,

25:05.639 --> 25:07.908
fifteen million Americans
struggle with alcoholism--

25:07.941 --> 25:10.677
Look, our product
is only dangerous

25:10.711 --> 25:12.245
when used excessively.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.747
So as aspirin,
for that matter.

25:13.780 --> 25:14.548
Aspirin?

25:14.581 --> 25:15.716
You're just like aspirin?

25:15.749 --> 25:17.584
You understand my point,
Counsel.

25:17.618 --> 25:19.119
When used responsibly--

25:19.152 --> 25:20.153
Do you advertise
to young people?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.655
Not underage, we don't.

25:21.688 --> 25:25.759
Your key target demo is
21 to 25-year-olds, isn't it?

25:25.792 --> 25:27.628
Which is perfectly legal.

25:27.661 --> 25:29.596
What research do you do
to make sure

25:29.630 --> 25:32.198
those ads intended
for 21-year-olds

25:32.232 --> 25:34.100
don't influence
19-year-olds?

25:34.134 --> 25:35.869
Look--
Are you aware, sir,

25:35.902 --> 25:39.640
that underage kids
are drinking your beer?

25:39.673 --> 25:41.975
We take every step to ensure
that doesn't happen,

25:42.008 --> 25:43.944
but parents have to take
some responsibility.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.046
YOUNG: You're aware...

25:46.079 --> 25:49.182
minors drink your beer?

25:49.215 --> 25:52.018
We're aware that
it happens sometimes.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.119
YOUNG: Sometimes?

25:53.153 --> 25:56.489
You're aware underage kids
are responsible

25:56.523 --> 25:58.491
for 12% of the consumption

25:58.525 --> 26:00.026
of all your beer,
aren't you?

26:00.060 --> 26:01.467
That figure is debatable.

26:01.501 --> 26:04.437
And that over 90%
of all the alcohol consumed

26:04.470 --> 26:06.840
by underage drinkers
is for bingeing.

26:06.873 --> 26:07.808
Is that debatable?

26:07.841 --> 26:10.777
We do not target
underage drinkers!

26:10.811 --> 26:12.078
Well, according
to the surgeon general,

26:12.112 --> 26:14.815
over half of all high school
juniors and seniors drink.

26:14.848 --> 26:16.182
But you don't target them?

26:16.216 --> 26:17.651
CARROLL:
We make it our business

26:17.684 --> 26:19.720
to curtail underage drinkers.

26:19.753 --> 26:20.887
Really?

26:20.921 --> 26:22.889
Besides those sex
and alcohol commercials,

26:22.923 --> 26:24.390
what else?
Objection!

26:24.424 --> 26:26.059
YOUNG: What the hell
do you do to curtail it?!

26:26.092 --> 26:27.027
Objection!
WEEKS: Mr. Young...

26:27.060 --> 26:28.829
YOUNG: Two-thirds
of underage drinkers

26:28.862 --> 26:30.631
buy their own beer,
Mr. Carroll!

26:30.664 --> 26:32.533
That's a vendor problem, not--

26:32.566 --> 26:33.767
YOUNG: Oh, I see,
It's not your problem?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.869
You just make the stuff
and put the logo on blimps?

26:35.902 --> 26:36.970
Objection!

26:37.003 --> 26:37.871
Mr. Young!

26:37.904 --> 26:39.906
This kid couldn't so much

26:39.940 --> 26:41.307
as watch a baseball game--

26:41.341 --> 26:42.676
WEEKS: Mr. Young.
--without hearing your jingle,

26:42.709 --> 26:45.311
Mr. Carroll, and he's dead.
He's dead!

26:45.345 --> 26:46.847
WEEKS: Mr. Young, that's enough!

26:46.880 --> 26:50.116
And you sit here testifying
nothing you can do.

26:51.585 --> 26:55.155
Nothing you can do
for Michael Berry.

27:18.318 --> 27:20.554
Go off my medication?

27:20.587 --> 27:22.388
The Supreme Court has said

27:22.422 --> 27:24.490
we can't execute the insane.

27:24.525 --> 27:26.560
It's our last best shot.

27:27.728 --> 27:30.296
Up until now, we have argued,

27:30.330 --> 27:34.267
"Don't kill her. She's not
the monster she used to be."

27:34.300 --> 27:37.037
And now you want me
to go off my medication

27:37.070 --> 27:39.806
so that you can argue,
"Don't kill her.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.407
She is the monster
she used to be"?

27:41.441 --> 27:43.644
Yes.

27:43.677 --> 27:44.778
And then, after that,

27:44.811 --> 27:46.813
we'll argue that
it's cruel and unusual

27:46.847 --> 27:48.682
to keep you insane
and we'll hopefully

27:48.715 --> 27:50.350
get you on the meds again.

27:51.952 --> 27:52.953
Oh, that sounds...

27:52.986 --> 27:55.188
Perverse.

27:55.221 --> 27:59.125
It is, and they will no doubt
try to force-medicate you.

27:59.159 --> 28:00.266
It's been upheld in the past

28:00.300 --> 28:03.303
but I have a better chance
at beating it.

28:06.673 --> 28:09.242
How long after you stopped
taking the medication before--

28:09.275 --> 28:11.177
It won't take long.

28:14.147 --> 28:15.081
Okay.

28:16.817 --> 28:20.621
I'm gonna draft up the document
stating your intent.

28:20.654 --> 28:22.022
I'm gonna need you
to sign them

28:22.055 --> 28:23.023
while you're
still competent.

28:23.790 --> 28:25.158
My intent being?

28:25.191 --> 28:29.395
You don't want the meds
under any circumstances.

28:32.833 --> 28:35.401
I will go crazy, Ellenor.

28:35.435 --> 28:37.203
You do realize that?

28:49.950 --> 28:52.853
Alcohol is part
of the American culture.

28:52.886 --> 28:54.655
I know it.

28:54.688 --> 28:56.289
I get it.

28:56.322 --> 28:58.592
We indulge openly,
proudly even.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.433
We toast at weddings.

29:00.466 --> 29:01.868
We drink to our health.

29:01.902 --> 29:03.269
We drink
in front of our kids,

29:03.303 --> 29:05.071
be it eggnog at Christmas,

29:05.105 --> 29:07.373
mint julep
at Kentucky Derby parties,

29:07.407 --> 29:09.042
Saint Patrick's Day.

29:09.075 --> 29:11.044
And we romanticize it,
don't we?

29:11.077 --> 29:14.180
Win a World Series
or a Super Bowl,

29:14.214 --> 29:16.750
out comes the champagne
on national television.

29:16.783 --> 29:17.851
Our best athletes,

29:17.884 --> 29:20.220
role models
for physical fitness,

29:20.253 --> 29:20.987
watch them drink.

29:21.021 --> 29:22.523
Hey, it's our culture.

29:22.556 --> 29:25.659
Like I said, I get it.

29:26.492 --> 29:28.762
But you know what,

29:28.795 --> 29:31.497
they never really warn you
about the downside.

29:31.532 --> 29:35.736
Fifteen million Americans
are alcoholics.

29:35.769 --> 29:38.672
Fifteen million.

29:38.705 --> 29:41.508
And the statistics,
they go on and on.

29:41.542 --> 29:44.177
It's the number one
teenage drug problem,

29:44.210 --> 29:47.313
the number one
drug problem in college,

29:47.347 --> 29:50.183
one quarter of all
emergency room admissions,

29:50.216 --> 29:53.286
almost a third of all suicides,

29:53.319 --> 29:56.456
one half
of all homicides, rapes,

29:56.489 --> 30:00.266
one third of traffic fatalities,
alcohol-related.

30:00.300 --> 30:04.270
It is the leading
cause of mental retardation,

30:04.304 --> 30:06.973
fetal alcohol syndrome.

30:09.009 --> 30:11.878
The cost to us,

30:11.912 --> 30:14.581
the taxpayer,
and our economy,

30:14.615 --> 30:18.619
over $185 billion
in lost productivity,

30:18.652 --> 30:22.255
healthcare expenses, crime,
car crashes, and other costs.

30:22.288 --> 30:25.358
The cost to Margaret
and Joshua Berry,

30:25.391 --> 30:27.227
their son.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.930
The cost to Sheila Berry,

30:29.963 --> 30:31.665
her brother.

30:31.698 --> 30:34.234
This was a decent kid,

30:34.267 --> 30:37.003
B student, shy, good athlete,

30:37.037 --> 30:38.972
who started having a few beers

30:39.005 --> 30:40.607
with his high school buddies,

30:40.641 --> 30:43.243
who developed
an addiction to a drug

30:43.276 --> 30:46.012
that ended up taking his life.

30:47.714 --> 30:49.149
This industry makes upward

30:49.182 --> 30:52.052
of a hundred billion dollars
a year,

30:52.085 --> 30:53.854
a lot of it coming from kids,

30:53.887 --> 30:56.590
children, and however
much they deny it,

30:56.623 --> 30:59.726
they target those kids
with their advertising.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.537
They buy time on the programs
these kids watch.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.805
We've all seen the ads.

31:04.838 --> 31:05.539
They're funny.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.573
Drinking is hip.

31:06.607 --> 31:07.674
It's cool. It's now.

31:07.708 --> 31:09.442
It kills.

31:10.877 --> 31:12.779
It kills.

31:12.813 --> 31:17.017
And they just take the money,
a lot of it.

31:17.050 --> 31:19.185
During the course
of this three-day trial,

31:19.219 --> 31:21.988
the alcohol industry
made another billion dollars.

31:22.022 --> 31:24.024
Now, we're
a capitalist society.

31:24.057 --> 31:26.793
Like I said, I get it.

31:26.827 --> 31:30.363
But when you contribute
to the death of human life

31:30.396 --> 31:33.700
over a hundred thousand lives
every year,

31:33.734 --> 31:36.136
how can you not take
some responsibility?

31:36.169 --> 31:38.839
It can't always be
about the money.

31:38.872 --> 31:41.007
That's what I don't get.

31:50.984 --> 31:53.620
Mr. Young says
we've committed fraud.

31:53.654 --> 31:55.155
He's wrong.

31:55.188 --> 31:57.691
We sell an honest product,
honestly.

31:57.724 --> 32:01.401
We are not tobacco.

32:01.434 --> 32:03.537
The tobacco company lied
about the risks

32:03.570 --> 32:05.572
associated with smoking.

32:05.606 --> 32:07.641
The risks of drinking
have been known

32:07.674 --> 32:09.610
for thousands of years

32:09.643 --> 32:11.211
and so have the benefits.

32:11.244 --> 32:14.815
We drink with our friends
to relax, to celebrate.

32:14.848 --> 32:18.184
There are social benefits
to responsible drinking,

32:18.218 --> 32:20.521
and we all know it.

32:20.554 --> 32:24.691
The problem is,
with alcohol abuse.

32:24.725 --> 32:27.127
And the question...

32:27.160 --> 32:28.962
is what do we do about it.

32:30.430 --> 32:32.098
What we've done so far

32:32.132 --> 32:34.434
is to pass a multitude
of regulations.

32:34.467 --> 32:37.237
My client has complied
with every one of them.

32:37.270 --> 32:39.573
We have raised
the drinking age.

32:39.606 --> 32:42.242
We've mandated warnings
on every bottle of beer.

32:42.275 --> 32:43.910
We now have dram shop acts,

32:43.944 --> 32:47.447
making people liable
who serve alcohol.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.551
You could be sued today
just for throwing a party.

32:52.452 --> 32:55.789
We have done everything
humanly possible.

32:55.822 --> 32:58.759
In truth, the only thing
left to do is ban alcohol.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.401
And we've already
tried that once

33:01.434 --> 33:05.371
with spectacular failure,
because, as Mr. Young

33:05.405 --> 33:07.173
correctly points out,

33:07.207 --> 33:10.677
drinking is in our culture.

33:10.711 --> 33:13.246
We're always gonna have
that cocktail.

33:13.279 --> 33:14.848
And no jury,

33:14.881 --> 33:16.316
no act of Congress,

33:16.349 --> 33:19.385
will ever, ever prevent it.

33:19.753 --> 33:21.955
I'll say this,

33:21.988 --> 33:23.857
Mr. Young is disingenuous

33:23.890 --> 33:25.792
when he says
that we're all about money

33:25.826 --> 33:27.694
and they're not.

33:27.728 --> 33:31.031
They are in here today
asking you...

33:31.064 --> 33:32.799
to award them money.

33:34.568 --> 33:35.969
Well, I won't be disingenuous.

33:36.002 --> 33:37.571
We're a business.

33:37.604 --> 33:40.907
Lawsuits, judgments, they become
a cost of doing business.

33:40.941 --> 33:42.408
And I don't have to tell you

33:42.442 --> 33:45.546
who that cost
always gets passed back to.

33:47.247 --> 33:49.616
You can't bring back
Michael Berry.

33:49.650 --> 33:51.284
I so wish you could.

33:51.317 --> 33:53.820
But all you can really do,

33:53.854 --> 33:55.756
unfortunately,

33:55.789 --> 33:59.159
is raise the price of beer.

33:59.192 --> 34:02.402
Because, like he told you,

34:02.435 --> 34:04.337
it's our culture.

34:12.145 --> 34:13.813
We're going to Court when?

34:13.847 --> 34:14.815
Next week.

34:14.848 --> 34:17.150
Obviously,
the more you regress,

34:17.183 --> 34:18.685
the better our chances.

34:18.719 --> 34:22.088
And if we lose, it's better
to die crazy than sane.

34:22.121 --> 34:23.724
I guess.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.626
Listen, um, given that,

34:25.659 --> 34:29.696
I probably should put in my
goodbyes to people now, right?

34:29.730 --> 34:31.397
So, I mean,
by this time next week,

34:31.431 --> 34:33.800
I may not even know
who my friends are.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.501
How are you feeling now?

34:35.536 --> 34:37.904
Anxious, a little.

34:37.938 --> 34:40.373
Nervous, I guess.

34:40.406 --> 34:43.476
I'm not sure what from.

34:43.510 --> 34:45.646
I don't know if it's because
I have come off my medication

34:45.679 --> 34:48.782
or whether it's because
I'm getting closer to...

34:48.815 --> 34:51.384
a lethal injection
but either way, uh,

34:51.417 --> 34:52.918
it's worse than a root canal,
isn't it?

34:53.018 --> 34:55.155
You already seem...

34:55.188 --> 34:56.790
Hyper.

34:56.822 --> 34:58.391
That's the first stage.

34:58.424 --> 35:00.801
You know, oddly, I talk
a lot more in the beginning

35:00.834 --> 35:02.936
and then I become withdrawn.

35:02.969 --> 35:05.539
This is my nervous stage.

35:05.572 --> 35:08.509
The good news is that
there is a heightened clarity

35:08.542 --> 35:10.410
that comes with it, so.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.746
Okay.

35:12.779 --> 35:15.315
These are the documents.

35:15.348 --> 35:17.684
It's basically the same
as a living will.

35:17.718 --> 35:20.286
It expresses your intent
not to be given

35:20.320 --> 35:22.756
the psychotropic drugs
under any circumstances.

35:22.789 --> 35:24.357
Okay.
I need you to sign it

35:24.390 --> 35:26.092
and date it.

35:26.126 --> 35:28.228
FREEMAN: Okay.

35:28.261 --> 35:29.863
Shouldn't this be notarized?

35:29.896 --> 35:30.897
It isn't necessary.

35:30.931 --> 35:32.566
If they argue
you lacked capacity,

35:32.599 --> 35:36.069
it just plays into our claim
of incompetence.

35:36.102 --> 35:37.571
FREEMAN: Okay, if we win,

35:37.604 --> 35:39.405
how are you gonna get me
back on the drugs,

35:39.439 --> 35:41.441
assuming I want to go
back on the drugs?

35:45.211 --> 35:47.514
Why wouldn't you want
to go back on the drugs?

35:47.548 --> 35:49.783
Well, you know,
I have to admit

35:49.816 --> 35:52.653
I feel less dull.

35:52.686 --> 35:55.088
But you said
when you really regressed...

35:55.121 --> 35:56.322
FREEMAN: True, true.

35:56.356 --> 35:58.659
Um, I guess
what I would like is a,

35:58.692 --> 36:00.834
um, an adjustment in the meds

36:00.867 --> 36:02.669
to keep me where I am now.

36:02.703 --> 36:06.006
I mean, I--this is a good state
where I am now.

36:06.039 --> 36:08.174
I feel more clear.

36:09.375 --> 36:13.146
Denise, first...

36:13.179 --> 36:15.549
let's work
on keeping you alive.

36:16.917 --> 36:18.018
Right.

36:30.531 --> 36:32.699
(door opens)

36:32.733 --> 36:34.000
Jury's back.

36:34.034 --> 36:34.835
What?

36:34.868 --> 36:36.336
(door closes)

36:36.369 --> 36:38.071
They have a verdict.

36:38.104 --> 36:39.706
(sighs)

36:39.740 --> 36:41.407
What's wrong?

36:41.441 --> 36:43.677
They could never have computed
the damages in an hour.

36:43.710 --> 36:44.878
Which means?

36:45.812 --> 36:47.548
They didn't have to.

36:47.581 --> 36:48.882
They found no liability.

36:50.316 --> 36:52.218
BERLUTI: Or maybe
they're just angry enough,

36:52.252 --> 36:53.820
they picked a big number

36:53.854 --> 36:54.988
and said, "Screw them."

36:57.658 --> 36:59.626
Let's go.

36:59.660 --> 37:00.934
Come on.

37:22.789 --> 37:25.258
WEEKS: Members of the jury,
you have reached a verdict?

37:26.226 --> 37:27.193
We have, Your Honor.

37:27.227 --> 37:29.162
Your Honor, could I have
a two-minute recess?

37:29.195 --> 37:31.197
We have an offer we'd like
to propose to the plaintiff.

37:31.231 --> 37:33.800
WEEKS: Your timing is curious,
Mr. Grundel.

37:33.834 --> 37:35.368
Until that verdict is entered,

37:35.401 --> 37:37.403
this case isn't decided.

37:37.437 --> 37:38.739
It's Friday.

37:38.772 --> 37:41.107
I'm not bringing
this jury back.

37:41.141 --> 37:43.009
You have two minutes.

37:51.752 --> 37:52.986
I'll confer with my client.

37:53.019 --> 37:54.888
It's got
a two-minute clock, Eugene,

37:54.921 --> 37:56.089
and it's final.

37:56.122 --> 37:58.391
Excuse me, please.

38:05.205 --> 38:07.440
Don't anybody scream.

38:07.473 --> 38:09.075
$1.6 million.

38:12.245 --> 38:14.080
No, why?

38:14.114 --> 38:14.915
What?

38:14.948 --> 38:16.650
He must've been
authorized to settle

38:16.683 --> 38:18.985
if he didn't like
the faces of the jury.

38:19.019 --> 38:20.921
Something tells him we've won.

38:20.954 --> 38:22.989
And a verdict against them
is too devastating,

38:23.023 --> 38:24.891
even if it's overturned
on appeal.

38:24.925 --> 38:26.527
Should we take it?

38:26.560 --> 38:27.694
It's a lot of money.

38:28.929 --> 38:30.597
Let's take our chances.

38:30.631 --> 38:31.598
What?!

38:31.632 --> 38:33.767
You said that
they couldn't possibly

38:33.800 --> 38:35.936
have computed damages
so fast.

38:35.969 --> 38:38.004
Well, maybe they did pick
a big fat number.

38:38.038 --> 38:39.906
And if we got them,
we'll let them off.

38:39.940 --> 38:42.576
$1.6 million is a lot
to walk away from.

38:42.609 --> 38:44.711
Not enough to make them hurt,
and if the idea--

38:44.745 --> 38:46.680
Excuse me one second.

38:50.784 --> 38:51.918
What are you doing?

38:51.952 --> 38:54.120
This is a verdict that
could send a message, Jimmy.

38:54.154 --> 38:55.155
We're this close.

38:55.188 --> 38:56.456
It's not about
sending a message.

38:56.489 --> 38:59.125
It's about getting
a result for our client.

38:59.159 --> 39:01.367
And $1.6--
The faces on those jurors--

39:01.401 --> 39:03.504
BERLUTI: We don't know
what those faces mean.

39:03.537 --> 39:04.971
I realize you may want
to stick it

39:05.005 --> 39:06.006
to the alcohol industry.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.040
I'm only thinking
about the client.

39:07.073 --> 39:10.043
It's got nothing to--
JOSHUA: What is going on?

39:10.076 --> 39:10.844
BERLUTI: We're divided.

39:10.877 --> 39:12.646
I think you should take it.

39:12.679 --> 39:15.315
Eugene votes to reject it.

39:15.348 --> 39:17.083
I have a feeling,
that's all I can say.

39:17.117 --> 39:18.384
It's not a science.

39:19.853 --> 39:22.388
(sighs)

39:22.422 --> 39:23.489
Let's hear what the jury says.

39:23.524 --> 39:24.157
Joshua.

39:24.190 --> 39:25.458
Eugene?

39:25.491 --> 39:28.128
If you want to make them pay,

39:28.161 --> 39:30.263
$1.6 million
is a drop in the bucket.

39:34.635 --> 39:36.069
Let's reject it.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.615
The offer is rejected,
Your Honor.

39:48.649 --> 39:50.283
Very well.

39:50.316 --> 39:52.519
Mr. Foreman, what say you?

39:55.188 --> 39:56.356
In the matter of the estate

39:56.389 --> 39:58.358
of Michael Berry
versus Portiss Brewery,

39:58.391 --> 40:00.233
on the count
of wrongful death,

40:00.266 --> 40:04.437
we, the jury, find
in favor of the plaintiff.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.840
And order the defendant
to pay compensatory damages

40:06.873 --> 40:09.510
in the amount of $700,000.

40:10.877 --> 40:13.914
We further order the defendant
to pay punitive damages

40:13.947 --> 40:17.183
in the amount of $125 million.

40:18.685 --> 40:22.255
Defense moves for a judgment,
notwithstanding the verdict!

40:22.288 --> 40:22.923
Denied.

40:22.956 --> 40:23.924
We appeal!

40:23.957 --> 40:26.126
So noted.

40:26.159 --> 40:27.460
Members of the jury,

40:27.493 --> 40:29.395
thank you for your service.

40:29.429 --> 40:30.831
You're excused.

40:30.864 --> 40:32.666
And this matter is adjourned.

40:32.699 --> 40:33.366
(gavel bangs)

40:35.401 --> 40:37.103
MARGARET: Oh, my God.

40:37.137 --> 40:39.873
(sobbing)

40:42.042 --> 40:43.610
This will be appealed.

40:43.644 --> 40:46.747
It'll be a long time
before you see any money, but...

40:48.749 --> 40:51.351
this is...
A good start.

40:51.384 --> 40:54.054
(sighs)
I don't know what to say.

40:54.087 --> 40:54.955
Neither do I.

41:02.769 --> 41:04.004
Wow.

41:06.072 --> 41:08.108
Yeah, wow.

41:17.283 --> 41:18.084
MARSHALL:
I tried to persuade her

41:18.118 --> 41:19.620
to come to the visiting room.

41:19.653 --> 41:21.387
It's okay.
Is she all right?

41:21.421 --> 41:23.256
I think so. She's...

41:23.289 --> 41:24.925
she just doesn't
want to come out,

41:24.958 --> 41:27.327
and I didn't really
want to force her.

41:31.965 --> 41:33.199
Denise?

41:33.233 --> 41:35.936
Hi. I'm sorry.

41:35.969 --> 41:38.204
I didn't, um, I didn't--

41:38.238 --> 41:40.507
I didn't feel safe.
I'm--

41:40.541 --> 41:42.609
I know it's not rational,

41:42.643 --> 41:45.145
and I realize that
I am just a couple of pills away

41:45.178 --> 41:47.948
from feeling better,
but even so--

41:47.981 --> 41:49.082
I mean, do you mind?

41:49.115 --> 41:50.584
I just--I feel
more comfortable in here.

41:50.617 --> 41:51.618
No problem.

41:51.652 --> 41:52.853
What's the news?

41:52.886 --> 41:54.054
There is no news.

41:54.087 --> 41:55.255
I just came by to tell you

41:55.288 --> 41:56.923
that all the doctors
are lined up,

41:56.957 --> 41:59.092
the appeal is being drafted,

41:59.125 --> 42:01.301
and we're ready to file
as soon as...

42:01.334 --> 42:04.304
As soon as I arrive
at my destination?

42:04.337 --> 42:05.806
FRUTT: Basically.

42:05.839 --> 42:06.540
How you doing?

42:06.573 --> 42:07.307
I'm okay.

42:07.340 --> 42:08.542
I'm okay.

42:08.575 --> 42:09.743
I'm heading into that

42:09.776 --> 42:11.778
I-don't-feel-like-being-
inside-my-skin part

42:11.812 --> 42:13.446
but I'm all right.

42:13.479 --> 42:15.381
FRUTT: Listen,
I'm gonna stop by daily

42:15.415 --> 42:16.617
and check up on you, okay?

42:19.753 --> 42:20.887
You know where to find me.

42:20.921 --> 42:22.689
I don't travel much.

42:22.723 --> 42:24.591
It's just as well.
It's not safe, is it?

42:24.625 --> 42:27.561
(music playing)

42:53.820 --> 42:56.757
(music playing)

43:18.484 --> 43:19.753
WOMAN: You stinker.

43:21.387 --> 43:24.290
(music playing)
