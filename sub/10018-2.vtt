00:50.571 --> 00:51.864
How you doing, Nurse Hathaway?

00:52.072 --> 00:55.658
If I were driving, we would've been there
by now, Paramedic Shepard.

00:56.492 --> 01:00.078
- You gotta love these late summer runs.
- Especially up to Humboldt Park.

01:00.245 --> 01:02.371
You ever been to California and Division?

01:02.538 --> 01:05.290
Yeah, that little outdoor cafÃ©?
Cappuccinos every morning.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.959
Yeah, well, slip that vest on
before you order.

01:19.467 --> 01:22.219
We always promise these rides
will be exciting.

01:22.428 --> 01:24.304
Might have to wait
on those cappuccinos.

01:24.471 --> 01:26.097
Yeah, right.

01:28.349 --> 01:31.101
Excuse me! Pardon me! Come on.

01:31.309 --> 01:34.061
We got this one. Hathaway, come here.

01:34.270 --> 01:38.398
He's cyanotic. Man, looks like he lost
about 4 liters. Doesn't look good.

01:38.606 --> 01:41.066
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

01:41.984 --> 01:46.028
Multiple gunshot wounds.
Chest, abdomen.

01:46.195 --> 01:47.905
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:48.113 --> 01:50.073
- Hey, Raul?
- Yeah?

01:50.240 --> 01:52.700
- We got Payaso over here.
- No breathing, no pulse.

01:52.908 --> 01:56.494
- We're in full arrest. How about you?
- Brains all over the asphalt, bro.

01:56.703 --> 01:59.955
Well, come over here. We need you.
You can help me tube him.

02:01.665 --> 02:03.541
- Here.
- Check his rhythm.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.543
- Where's the ambu-bag?
- Behind you.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.086
7.5?

02:10.588 --> 02:12.798
A little cricoid pressure.
Got it!

02:13.882 --> 02:18.260
You bag him. I'm gonna stick him.
Goddamn it!

02:18.469 --> 02:22.347
- His name is Payaso?
- It's a nickname. Means "little clown. "

02:22.555 --> 02:27.976
- Worked on him three times before.
- You're really pissing me off, Payasito!

02:28.143 --> 02:30.102
- Crackhead at 14.
- We need a line.

02:30.311 --> 02:31.854
I can't get a vein anywhere here.

02:33.438 --> 02:36.774
- Pedro!
- Can we get a little crowd control here?

02:36.941 --> 02:39.943
- Please, everybody, move back!
- Back up, please.

02:46.197 --> 02:49.867
Coming through! Excuse me.

02:52.952 --> 02:55.329
One, two, three.

02:55.496 --> 02:57.623
Give them room, give them room.
Back it up.

03:00.917 --> 03:05.462
Move it back! Everybody, back up!
Back, back! Everybody, back!

03:05.628 --> 03:09.298
I need you all to move back, please.
Back up! Out of the way!

03:09.756 --> 03:11.633
County General. ETA, seven minutes.

03:12.175 --> 03:14.843
Give him another amp of epi
in two minutes.

03:15.010 --> 03:16.219
Got it.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.150
Welcome to hell.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.480
- Lydia, you seen Carter?
- Not lately.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.942
- Hey, Kerry.
- Hey, Peter. These your sprouts?

04:33.109 --> 04:35.653
One ER rotation together,
and that's what you remember?

04:35.820 --> 04:37.446
They're dead. I need the space.

04:37.863 --> 04:39.489
So how is it going?

04:40.239 --> 04:45.326
My first day here, and I've only upset
Doug Ross. That's not too bad, huh?

04:45.493 --> 04:47.203
You must be losing your touch.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.830
- Good to see you again, Kerry.
- Thanks, Peter.

04:50.122 --> 04:51.915
- No can do.
- That's not the attitude...

04:52.081 --> 04:55.417
-...that we encourage around here, Bob.
- No can do, Dr. Ross.

04:55.584 --> 04:58.086
- You love saying that, don't you?
- Anybody seen Carter?

04:58.253 --> 05:01.839
Anybody seen the chocolate doughnut
that Bob refuses to bring me?

05:02.005 --> 05:05.383
He's in Exam 4. Dr. Weaver said
no more food errands.

05:05.550 --> 05:09.928
- Inappropriate use of personnel.
- You just love Dr. Weaver, don't you?

05:10.095 --> 05:13.180
Appeals to that whole
Germanic thing in you.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.765
I am Polish.

05:14.932 --> 05:18.267
- Screaming twins. Curtain 2.
- All right.

05:19.810 --> 05:22.020
- Morning, Susan.
- What've you got?

05:22.187 --> 05:24.147
Fourteen-year-old,
multiple gunshot wounds.

05:24.313 --> 05:27.024
Asystole, 2 amps epi,
2 mgs atropine in the field.

05:27.191 --> 05:29.692
- How long has he been down?
- Thirty-five minutes.

05:29.859 --> 05:32.486
- Looking for miracles?
- Two liters of saline already in.

05:36.322 --> 05:40.325
- On my count. One, two, three.
- Here we go.

05:41.076 --> 05:42.410
Slumming with the paramedics?

05:42.577 --> 05:45.621
Yeah, recertifying for my MICN,
so pretty much.

05:45.788 --> 05:48.414
Come on, Payaso, you've survived
worse than this before.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.833
- He's in fib.
- Let's shock him. Two hundred.

05:52.751 --> 05:56.254
- Four units O-neg.
- Got the loop. Clear.

05:58.422 --> 06:00.507
- Three hundred. Clear?
- Clear.

06:00.673 --> 06:03.175
-360?
- Yeah. Clear?

06:05.260 --> 06:07.804
- Amp of epi here.
- No breath sounds on the left side.

06:07.970 --> 06:09.972
- Hemothorax. Chest-tube tray.
- Got your O-neg.

06:10.139 --> 06:11.181
Another amp of epi?

06:11.390 --> 06:14.809
Yeah, let's high-dose him.
Five milligrams.

06:16.101 --> 06:17.811
Scalpel.

06:21.522 --> 06:23.107
Tube.

06:25.817 --> 06:28.194
Oh, man, the blood's pouring out.

06:31.363 --> 06:32.822
He's still asleep.

06:32.989 --> 06:35.991
God, we had such a night last night.
You wouldn't believe it.

06:36.158 --> 06:41.370
Triple MVA. Car versus horse trailer
in the middle of Chicago. What a mess.

06:41.537 --> 06:46.249
I had such a blast. But we didn't get to
bed till 5, and now I am late for rounds.

06:46.415 --> 06:52.295
So if you're still here when he wakes up,
would you tell him I said thanks? Thanks.

07:00.884 --> 07:04.178
Carter. Carter!

07:04.345 --> 07:08.223
There's already 1500cc's
in the Pleuravac. Thoracotomy tray?

07:08.390 --> 07:10.725
- Time down?
- Forty-four minutes.

07:13.185 --> 07:17.021
- There's a bucketful. Get some lap pads.
- Somebody get a light in here.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.481
Double MVA at the back door.
What've you got?

07:19.648 --> 07:22.483
- Multiple gunshot wounds, in full arrest.
- Susan.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.319
High dose epi, atropine,
4 units O-neg.

07:25.486 --> 07:29.113
- He's exsanguinated into the left chest.
- You might want to help your pals.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.157
- I work here. Nurse manager.
- Kerry Weaver. Chief Resident.

07:32.324 --> 07:35.076
- How long has he been in arrest?
- Forty-five minutes.

07:35.243 --> 07:38.078
- Let's call it. We need the room.
- It's my case, Kerry.

07:38.245 --> 07:41.331
We got a 7-year-old kid and his mom
coming in, who we can save.

07:41.497 --> 07:45.500
- We've got a 14-year-old on the table.
- Who we can't. Call it.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.169
- What was that time?
- Forty-five down.

07:48.336 --> 07:51.755
Susan. Susan!

07:51.922 --> 07:56.008
All right, I'm calling it.
Time of death, 7:19.

07:56.592 --> 07:59.511
Someone call Housekeeping.

07:59.677 --> 08:02.888
- Poor tidal volume. No response.
- Another gurney, please!

08:03.055 --> 08:05.682
- Let's tube him and use number six.
- Mannitol.

08:05.849 --> 08:07.516
We need X-ray in here!

08:08.517 --> 08:11.394
- Welcome to hell.
- Who's on for neurosurgery?

08:11.561 --> 08:14.438
- Carrera.
- Page him. Stat.

08:15.814 --> 08:17.524
Tube's in. Hyperventilate.

08:17.691 --> 08:20.026
Absolutely nothing happened,
I can assure you.

08:20.192 --> 08:23.070
She must've made the other bed.
That's where she was sleeping.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.988
We didn't do anything.

08:25.154 --> 08:28.198
- Carter, do I look like your father?
- No, actually, not at all.

08:28.365 --> 08:32.284
I don't care what you did or didn't do,
except for oversleep, which you did.

08:32.451 --> 08:36.121
Despite your nap, I assume you're
fully prepared for this morning's surgery.

08:36.288 --> 08:37.538
- Absolutely.
- Good.

08:37.705 --> 08:39.707
- Because I'm gonna work your ass off.
- Great.

08:39.874 --> 08:43.376
- Because we're doing the....
- Thoracic outlet syndrome.

08:43.543 --> 08:45.211
Right.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.173
I'll just be over there.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.680
Carol.

09:00.847 --> 09:02.140
- You scared me.
- I know.

09:02.307 --> 09:04.475
I do that to a lot of people. I'm sorry.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.644
And I'm sorry I didn't realize
who you were earlier.

09:08.061 --> 09:12.105
- Oh, that's all right.
- You enjoying paramedic ride-along?

09:12.272 --> 09:13.982
It's fun being out for a change.

09:14.149 --> 09:16.108
Good.
I've been reorganizing a little bit.

09:16.275 --> 09:18.569
- Can I run some things by you?
- Okay.

09:18.735 --> 09:21.738
The doctors need to write down
their orders when they give them.

09:21.904 --> 09:25.240
No more of this three-hours-later crap,
then blaming the nurses.

09:25.407 --> 09:26.616
That'd be great.

09:26.783 --> 09:30.869
And I think that Residents are capable of
cleaning up after procedures, don't you?

09:31.036 --> 09:33.121
- Are you gonna tell them that?
- Sure. Why not?

09:33.288 --> 09:36.790
They'll stop peeking through the charts,
picking the most interesting cases.

09:36.957 --> 09:40.043
I mean, you don't get a choice.
Why should they, right?

09:40.918 --> 09:44.754
- It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
- Already is.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.597
So thoracic outlet syndrome....

09:57.764 --> 10:00.516
I really haven't had a chance to....

10:02.267 --> 10:05.937
- It's the lung, right?
- Don't get me started on the Brigham.

10:06.103 --> 10:07.438
- What?
- They bring me in...

10:07.605 --> 10:10.607
...to set up their Emergency Medicine
training program.

10:10.774 --> 10:14.443
Keep me on the line for six months.
Damn thing never got out of committee.

10:14.610 --> 10:17.028
- Bunch of mud-phuds.
- Mud-phuds?

10:17.737 --> 10:21.240
MD-Ph.D.
Bench scientists doing research.

10:21.406 --> 10:25.785
Running gels, chopping up DNA.

10:25.951 --> 10:28.537
Northern blots, Western blots,
Southern blots.

10:28.703 --> 10:30.538
- Blots?
- Don't get me wrong.

10:30.705 --> 10:32.623
They're good people.
They're smart people.

10:32.790 --> 10:36.876
But they couldn't diagnose a cold
if it stood up and sneezed on them.

10:37.043 --> 10:39.211
So you must be pretty glad
to be back, then?

10:39.378 --> 10:40.879
You bet you.

10:41.046 --> 10:46.174
Give me a good sick body, needs a little
slicing, and I'm a happy man.

10:46.341 --> 10:49.010
Go find Benton, will you?
I believe we're ready.

10:49.844 --> 10:52.137
Maybe it's just too complicated
for tonight.

10:52.346 --> 10:54.556
No, no, I want to see you.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.057
- I promised Jackie I'd--
- Dr. Benton, I think...

10:57.224 --> 11:01.936
...all he needs is active resistance
therapy for that left leg.

11:02.103 --> 11:04.646
Yeah, that's good.

11:06.106 --> 11:09.316
I promised Jackie that I'd pick up Steven
after football practice.

11:09.483 --> 11:11.151
Walt's down with the flu.

11:11.318 --> 11:14.112
My class is over at 7.
I can make it by 7:30.

11:16.613 --> 11:19.657
- How about 8?
- AI's off at 10.

11:26.871 --> 11:28.581
Oh, man.

11:31.750 --> 11:34.960
Yeah, it's yummy, yummy.

11:35.127 --> 11:40.172
- Hey, Bob, you seen Big Susie?
- At the desk. You look very sharp.

11:40.339 --> 11:44.467
Thank you. Did you hear that, bumpkin?
She says I look sharp.

11:45.218 --> 11:48.178
- Hey, Susie.
- Chloe, what are you doing here?

11:48.345 --> 11:53.516
I'm running so late. Will you take
the baby to daycare, please?

11:53.682 --> 11:57.101
We're learning Windows. I can't miss
class this morning. It's complicated.

11:57.268 --> 11:59.020
How are things at Midwest Biz?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.730
- You know the academy?
- Night school two years ago.

12:01.897 --> 12:04.857
If you need help, I'm pretty good
at all that computer stuff.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.275
Oh, thanks, Jerry.

12:06.442 --> 12:10.611
- She should've been here an hour ago.
- I know, but don't I look sharp?

12:10.778 --> 12:12.613
- Yeah, you do.
- I know.

12:14.281 --> 12:16.199
Okay. Thank you, Susie.

12:16.366 --> 12:20.035
So you're gonna pick her up after work,
okay? Because I got that job fair.

12:20.202 --> 12:22.870
- That's tonight?
- I put it on our weekly schedule.

12:23.037 --> 12:25.622
Oh, yeah, that's right, that's right.
I forgot.

12:25.789 --> 12:27.499
Okay. Bye, Susie. Bye, sweetie.

12:27.666 --> 12:31.293
- You need any help?
- No.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.712
Oh, sorry about that. Okay, yeah.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.007
- So just hold up his arm.
- He's a pretty big guy.

12:39.174 --> 12:42.385
- Oh, yeah, 380, easy.
- Big arm.

12:45.554 --> 12:48.139
You'd think we'd have
some kind of pulley thing for this.

12:48.306 --> 12:52.642
Watch the pleura.
Don't want to puncture it. We do.

12:52.809 --> 12:54.477
- We do?
- Hold it up higher, Carter.

12:54.644 --> 12:56.895
Keep the neurovascular bundle
out of the way.

12:58.063 --> 13:00.523
Let's Bovie this little fella, please.

13:00.690 --> 13:04.317
- So the pulley thing, it's not working?
- Periosteal elevator.

13:07.862 --> 13:10.364
- What did he do?
- Overslept.

13:10.530 --> 13:15.367
- Well, this will teach him a lesson.
- Yeah, well, that's what we're here for.

13:15.534 --> 13:20.371
To teach him. Right, Carter?
Don't move that arm.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.999
Just out of curiosity,
how long is this surgery?

13:24.165 --> 13:26.500
I need the rib cutter.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.919
And Bovie, please.

13:34.048 --> 13:36.424
So Rachel had her pancakes,
then threw up at 6:30.

13:36.591 --> 13:39.510
Jen had a breakfast meeting.
I missed the first train out.

13:39.677 --> 13:42.137
While I'm waiting for two hours
at the station...

13:42.304 --> 13:44.764
...I start talking to this guy
named Gozukizil.

13:44.931 --> 13:46.682
So he's heard I'm a doc, right?

13:46.849 --> 13:49.100
Next thing you know,
he's pulling down his pants.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.686
He wants to show me some mole
on his butt.

13:51.852 --> 13:54.104
I don't think I'm cut out for commuting.

13:54.271 --> 13:57.231
Mark, that's really interesting,
but it's been a lousy morning.

13:57.398 --> 14:00.859
I've got a crying baby in my arms.
Here's the diaper bag.

14:01.026 --> 14:03.778
So maybe we can talk
when I get back from daycare.

14:03.945 --> 14:08.281
Sure. Oh, I see Kerry Weaver made it in.
Have you had a chance to meet her yet?

14:08.448 --> 14:13.285
Oh, yeah. She's in, all right.
And I've definitely met her.

14:13.451 --> 14:16.912
Great call on the new Chief Resident,
Mark. Really special.

14:30.464 --> 14:32.299
Hi, Al. It's me.

14:32.465 --> 14:35.551
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry, honey.
I hate to do this again...

14:35.718 --> 14:38.887
...but they changed
the study-group schedule.

14:39.054 --> 14:40.513
Yeah, for tonight.

14:41.806 --> 14:44.641
<i>- I know, but what can I do?
- Well, how about a late dinner?</i>

14:44.808 --> 14:49.019
No, I probably won't get out
till midnight.

14:49.186 --> 14:53.064
No problem. It was running fine
this morning. Started right up.

14:53.731 --> 14:55.691
Yeah, I'll be careful.

14:56.149 --> 15:00.069
Okay, thanks. And, Al, I'm sorry.

15:02.321 --> 15:05.490
Okay. I'll see you tonight.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.242
Okay. Bye.

15:14.746 --> 15:16.956
Sticky bag lady for you.

15:17.165 --> 15:20.000
- Maple syrup would be my guess.
- Yeah, it was a real mystery.

15:20.167 --> 15:23.086
She fell trying out her new Rollerblades
down Michigan Avenue.

15:23.253 --> 15:25.129
- Wanna take her, Susan?
- I really would.

15:25.338 --> 15:29.424
But I've already taken the next patient
in line. Rhinorrhea with otitis. Exam 5.

15:29.591 --> 15:31.967
Okay. Conni, let's get a room.

15:32.176 --> 15:36.012
Oh, man, I hate the sticky ones.

15:36.221 --> 15:38.764
- Oh, you got another one?
- Yeah. Hitchhiker.

15:38.931 --> 15:40.307
Flagged us down on the way in.

15:40.474 --> 15:42.767
- She asked for you personally.
- Loretta, right?

15:42.934 --> 15:45.894
- Same room?
- Sure. Why not?

15:46.061 --> 15:50.856
- Looks like the old PID shuffle.
- Pelvic inflammatory disease.

15:51.023 --> 15:53.233
Occupational hazard.

15:54.234 --> 15:57.444
I just bring them in. I don't need
to know what they have.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.322
Five hundred milligrams tetracycline
and a dose of mebendazole...

16:01.489 --> 16:03.199
...for the baby with the pinworm.

16:03.365 --> 16:05.992
There you go. I've written them
all down. Are you happy?

16:06.159 --> 16:10.287
- And those would be generic, Dr. Ross?
- Yes, Haleh, those would be generic.

16:10.454 --> 16:13.498
Mrs. Beals, I'm Dr. Ross.
This is Haleh Adams.

16:13.665 --> 16:18.210
- And you must be Byron.
- Yeah. He burned himself.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.628
Let me see. Let's take a look.

16:21.504 --> 16:23.172
Yeah, boy.

16:23.922 --> 16:27.341
It looks kind of cool and
gory-Iooking, though, huh?

16:29.468 --> 16:31.344
Do you feel that? Yeah?

16:31.511 --> 16:35.264
- It happened while you were at work?
- The manager called me.

16:35.889 --> 16:38.266
He had the cops
and the fire department there.

16:38.433 --> 16:40.976
They were all yelling,
so I brought him here.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.979
- The manager?
- Yeah, we live in a motel.

16:44.187 --> 16:45.980
The Harbor View.

16:46.147 --> 16:49.191
Although there's no harbor,
and there's no view.

16:50.859 --> 16:53.486
Byron set the room on fire.

16:54.695 --> 16:57.071
I guess we probably don't live there
anymore.

16:59.365 --> 17:02.867
What is the differential diagnosis
for pelvic pain?

17:03.034 --> 17:05.328
- Ectopic pregnancy.
- Appendicitis.

17:05.493 --> 17:07.871
- And....
- Stress in the workplace.

17:09.747 --> 17:11.374
What else?

17:12.665 --> 17:15.585
Mittelschmerz, PID, endometriosis...

17:15.752 --> 17:18.628
...ruptured ovarian cyst,
to name a few more.

17:18.796 --> 17:20.839
- My money's on PID.
- You had it before?

17:21.006 --> 17:24.050
Yeast infection,
urinary tract infection....

17:24.215 --> 17:26.885
- Not much I haven't had.
- Tests?

17:27.469 --> 17:31.972
CBC, lytes, pregnancy,
cultures for GC and chlamydia.

17:32.723 --> 17:34.557
Barinski?

17:35.475 --> 17:38.018
- Pelvic ultrasound?
- Not quite yet.

17:38.227 --> 17:41.813
Let's assume for the moment that it is
PID. How do you want to treat her?

17:45.065 --> 17:48.568
Ceftriaxone and Zithromax.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.861
She is way ahead of you here.

17:54.238 --> 17:57.116
- Joanie, how is she?
- Susan, thanks for coming up so quickly.

17:57.282 --> 18:01.535
Oh, what's wrong, little one?
Are you okay? She's burning up.

18:01.702 --> 18:05.288
It's just a slight fever, but you know
the rules, no fevers or infections.

18:05.497 --> 18:08.249
Thank you for calling me.
I'm wanna get her checked out.

18:08.415 --> 18:10.250
I'm sure it's nothing serious, Susan.

18:10.417 --> 18:12.960
- Did you call Chloe?
- No, this is one of her class days.

18:13.127 --> 18:15.879
- You're the contact.
- Oh, right.

18:16.046 --> 18:18.006
You may want to take her
downstairs first.

18:18.214 --> 18:20.758
Yes, yes. Thank you.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.677
I don't know who's in worse shape,
mom or kid?

18:23.885 --> 18:25.345
Let's worry about the kid first.

18:25.511 --> 18:27.638
Get ahold of Jack Chandler,
Child Psychiatry.

18:27.846 --> 18:31.933
I don't know if he's on, but track him
down. He owes me a favor. Okay?

18:32.099 --> 18:34.059
- Okay.
- Thank you, Haleh.

18:34.226 --> 18:36.936
Doug, I need you for Little Susie.
Fever from daycare.

18:37.103 --> 18:39.105
- Maybe she should go to Pedes.
- Let me look.

18:39.271 --> 18:42.524
- What's the story with this little one?
- She's burning up!

18:42.691 --> 18:44.609
Well, not really. I'll check her out.

18:44.775 --> 18:47.778
It might be roseola. She looks
like she might be getting a rash.

18:47.944 --> 18:50.321
- I don't actually see that.
- Maybe she's bacteremic.

18:50.488 --> 18:52.865
- Is there anything going around?
- Always, always.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.116
Now, listen,
why don't you go on your break...

18:55.283 --> 18:58.869
...and let your friendly pediatrician
take a look.

18:59.078 --> 19:01.371
- Yeah, okay.
- Come here.

19:01.579 --> 19:03.956
- Thanks.
- Dr. Lewis?

19:04.123 --> 19:07.876
Dr. Weaver asked if you could take
the bounce-back back pain in Exam 6.

19:08.043 --> 19:11.378
Bounce-back back pain, right, sure.
And, Bob, could you do me a favor...

19:11.545 --> 19:15.131
...and call my sister for me? Chloe
Lewis, Midwest Business Academy.

19:15.298 --> 19:17.007
The number's on a card in my wallet...

19:17.174 --> 19:19.468
...in my bag, in a drawer,
in a desk, in the lounge.

19:19.634 --> 19:22.345
Tell her Susie's sick,
and she needs to come pick her up.

19:22.511 --> 19:25.347
- Bag, drawer, desk, lounge. Got it.
- Thank you.

19:26.473 --> 19:28.099
So, what do you wanna do?

19:28.266 --> 19:32.686
How about some Jim Beam
and call it day?

19:32.852 --> 19:36.272
- We should get CBC and Chem-7.
- Lytes?

19:36.480 --> 19:39.149
Lytes are in the Chem-7.
But before we order any tests...

19:39.315 --> 19:42.651
...why don't we observe the patient.
What's wrong with him?

19:46.237 --> 19:49.740
Okay, does the fact that he's
bright yellow suggest anything?

19:49.907 --> 19:52.367
He's jaundiced.
Probable alcoholic hepatitis.

19:52.575 --> 19:55.744
I'd start him on a banana bag
and check his LFTs.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.164
Carter, take this whiny guy.

20:00.331 --> 20:03.917
Frequent flyer complaining
of stomach pain, Exam 4.

20:05.710 --> 20:10.046
Betadine, Kerlix, adult no-necks....
God, I love County.

20:10.213 --> 20:13.966
Private hospitals get all bent out
of shape if you steal their supplies.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.509
Stealing supplies?

20:16.009 --> 20:19.512
We were just saying how it's not
really considered theft here at County.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.346
I know. I was joking.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.181
There's a Mrs. Rodriguez here.

20:23.348 --> 20:26.517
You brought in her son this morning,
that 14-year-old.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.560
Anyway, someone said you knew
the family.

20:28.727 --> 20:33.063
I think it's probably best if they hear it
from someone they know. Sorry.

20:38.150 --> 20:41.903
I don't know the family.
I've never seen them before.

20:45.906 --> 20:48.533
This is not what I do.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.409
Why don't we put this stuff down.

20:55.621 --> 20:58.665
- What was his name again?
- Payaso.

20:58.832 --> 21:02.877
No, that's a nickname.
It's Carlos, I think.

21:04.795 --> 21:09.256
Mrs. Rodriguez, I'm Carol Hathaway.
I'm a nurse here at the hospital.

21:17.012 --> 21:18.555
Go ahead.

21:18.722 --> 21:21.724
Your son, Carlos, was brought in
this morning.

21:27.228 --> 21:30.063
He had multiple gunshot wounds
to his chest.

21:30.230 --> 21:33.899
We tried to save him for 45 minutes.

21:38.319 --> 21:41.572
We used all our capabilities,
but his heart stopped...

21:42.656 --> 21:44.782
...and he died. I'm very sorry.

22:00.085 --> 22:01.795
His name is Rawlings, 51 years old.

22:01.962 --> 22:04.088
Acute onset of right groin pain
last evening...

22:04.255 --> 22:06.006
...with nausea and vomiting times three.

22:06.173 --> 22:08.050
No bowel movement
in the last 24 hours.

22:08.216 --> 22:09.843
And a previously reducible mass...

22:10.009 --> 22:13.137
...that suddenly became tender
and nonreducible after sneezing.

22:13.303 --> 22:16.597
He's currently on no medications
and has no allergies.

22:16.764 --> 22:20.434
Upon physical exam, a small, tender,
nonreducible mass in the right groin.

22:20.642 --> 22:22.477
Consistent with a strangulated hernia.

22:22.644 --> 22:24.603
Let's get him up to the O.R. Let's move.

22:24.770 --> 22:28.356
IV and Foley are in. CBC and lytes
are back. O.R.'s been notified.

22:28.523 --> 22:30.191
- Carter, you ordered all that?
- Yeah.

22:30.358 --> 22:31.608
Good pickup.

22:31.775 --> 22:34.611
- Thanks. I was examining him--
- Let's just get him up.

22:34.777 --> 22:36.362
Come on, move! Clear! Clear!

22:36.529 --> 22:39.865
I think you're the only Resident whose
handwriting the nurses can read.

22:40.031 --> 22:41.449
Well, that's something.

22:41.616 --> 22:45.452
So let them read it. Write down the
meds when you're ordering them, okay?

22:45.619 --> 22:48.871
I don't want a screwup because
some nurse forgot the heparin.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.582
- The nurses here are pretty good.
- The nurses here are downright great.

22:52.791 --> 22:55.459
And I think they deserve that
from the rest of us.

22:56.377 --> 22:58.295
Oh, good, Doug. How is she?

22:58.462 --> 23:02.298
She's fine, except for the noise factor
and a slight cold.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.884
- She'll be fine in a day or so.
- Thanks, Doug.

23:06.050 --> 23:09.386
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
You just have a little cold, is all.

23:09.553 --> 23:10.804
That's all. It's okay.

23:10.971 --> 23:12.639
- Dr. Lewis. Dr. Lewis.
- Yes.

23:12.805 --> 23:14.473
It's okay.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.726
- Your sister isn't there.
- Did they say where she went?

23:17.892 --> 23:20.895
No, they said she hasn't been there
in three weeks.

23:21.061 --> 23:23.605
What do they call it, "drop off"?

23:23.897 --> 23:26.107
- Dropped out?
- Yes.

23:28.108 --> 23:30.902
You're kidding, Bob, right?

23:54.378 --> 23:56.296
Why don't you give me a hand.
Susan?

23:58.172 --> 24:02.800
Susan? Bob tells me you've been sitting
here for 20 minutes.

24:02.967 --> 24:05.552
Are you in some kind of a fugue state?

24:08.763 --> 24:12.432
We've got a trauma coming in.
A bank robber.

24:12.599 --> 24:17.394
Some little old lady mowed him down
while he was fleeing the scene.

24:17.561 --> 24:20.730
Hit him with her car.
It's all very exciting.

24:20.897 --> 24:24.108
Malik will watch the baby.

24:24.817 --> 24:27.152
I slid the peanut
under the spermatic cord.

24:27.318 --> 24:29.487
- What's a peanut?
- Oh, sorry.

24:29.653 --> 24:31.738
I keep forgetting
you haven't done surgery.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.991
It's a small clamp
with some gauze on the end of it.

24:35.783 --> 24:38.285
I'm sorry.
Are you sure you don't mind this?

24:38.452 --> 24:40.078
I could probably practice
on some patient.

24:40.286 --> 24:42.997
No, no. You're actually
pretty good at it.

24:43.747 --> 24:46.165
Yeah, but I missed one
earlier this morning and--

24:46.332 --> 24:49.084
In that case, I think the veins
are a little over there.

24:50.544 --> 24:53.838
Yeah. It's a pretty complicated surgery,
actually. I was surprised...

24:54.005 --> 24:56.673
...that Dr. Benton let me
Bovie those bleeders.

24:56.840 --> 25:00.343
You're kidding. I didn't think
med students got to Bovie anything.

25:00.509 --> 25:01.760
It's very rare.

25:01.927 --> 25:03.887
Did you do it in that surgery
this morning?

25:04.054 --> 25:06.847
The thoracic outlet syndrome?
No, that's standard stuff.

25:07.014 --> 25:09.182
They didn't really need me too much
on that.

25:09.349 --> 25:12.185
Hey, that looks pretty good.

25:12.351 --> 25:14.853
Maybe I could draw some blood later?

25:15.020 --> 25:16.771
Sure.

25:28.321 --> 25:30.281
Carter.

25:31.240 --> 25:36.577
BP's 100/50, pulse 120. Blunt trauma
to the abdomen, both legs and head.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.746
Car threw him about 15 feet.
Knocked him out of his sneakers.

25:39.913 --> 25:43.541
Cops kept questioning him, as if he
wasn't gorked out or something.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.043
They were following us all the way in.

25:49.921 --> 25:51.964
- On my count....
- One, two, three, now.

25:52.131 --> 25:54.507
- Love your work.
- Always.

25:54.674 --> 25:58.093
- Let's go. Hurry up, Conni.
- Look, we got a child bank robber.

25:58.260 --> 26:02.555
Get a CBC, type and cross-match
6 units, Chem-7.

26:02.722 --> 26:04.348
Get a Foley, and we need x-rays...

26:04.515 --> 26:07.934
...cross-table C-spine, chest, pelvis
and both lower extremities.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.478
Conni, could you please call
for the portable now?

26:11.645 --> 26:14.230
Conni, get some O-neg down here
while you're at it.

26:14.397 --> 26:16.023
- How are you doing?
- Really well.

26:16.190 --> 26:18.942
- Has your day gotten better?
- Goodbye lateral breath sounds.

26:19.109 --> 26:21.736
Actually, no. Seems to be
tension in the workplace.

26:21.902 --> 26:24.446
Holy moly, check this out.

26:25.697 --> 26:27.115
Lottery time.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.408
- You think anyone will notice?
- I know I won't.

26:29.575 --> 26:31.618
Can we get the peritoneal lavage
prepped?

26:31.785 --> 26:33.744
And where the hell's the Foley?

26:42.959 --> 26:45.962
All right, let's get that lavage going.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.552
Hey, you boys want one of these?

26:56.219 --> 26:58.971
- What?
- It's kind of a policy thing with us.

26:59.138 --> 27:01.306
Wet-Naps are for wimps.

27:01.473 --> 27:05.476
Oh, yeah? Well, it might help clean off
some of that primordial ooze.

27:06.602 --> 27:08.020
What?

27:08.812 --> 27:13.315
- Hey, why's 23 here?
- Maybe there are multiple victims.

27:18.235 --> 27:21.196
Hey, Larkey, the boys at Dispatch
screw up again?

27:21.363 --> 27:24.949
No, we were out cruising
for snow cones. Heard the call.

27:25.115 --> 27:27.576
- Is this the seizure?
- Heat prostration.

27:27.742 --> 27:30.161
Fell down,
started mumbling in Lithuanian...

27:30.328 --> 27:35.456
...which our junior ticket taker there
diagnosed as a seizure.

27:35.623 --> 27:38.834
Okay. Well, it looks like you have
everything under control here.

27:39.001 --> 27:43.254
- Your rig's a little sloppy, though.
- Some of us are trying to work here.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.172
Hey, Larkey.

27:46.673 --> 27:48.716
So where are those snow cones?

27:54.554 --> 27:57.514
You did excellent work today, Carter.

27:59.432 --> 28:03.060
A lot of students freeze up on their
first Bovie, but you were calm, steady.

28:03.227 --> 28:04.978
- Morgenstern was impressed.
- Really?

28:05.145 --> 28:07.730
So was I. Vaguely.

28:07.897 --> 28:10.065
Choledocholithotomy,
first thing in the morning.

28:10.232 --> 28:12.817
- And then I could scrub in?
-7 a.m.

28:12.984 --> 28:18.238
- About the IV thing that happened--
- Carter! Just don't oversleep.

28:31.706 --> 28:34.917
I'd always heard banks put dye in
with stolen money.

28:35.083 --> 28:37.502
Well, guess it's better
than being puked on...

28:37.669 --> 28:41.213
-...but harder to get out, I hear.
- Yeah.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.590
Don't suppose we get
to keep the money.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.425
- God knows County could use it.
- No, I don't suppose.

28:49.135 --> 28:52.763
I understand your niece has a cold.

28:56.224 --> 28:58.767
Fluids and fever-control measures.

28:58.934 --> 29:01.519
Yeah, Malik's looking after her
in Room 5.

29:01.686 --> 29:07.732
- I saw her. She is quite adorable.
- Thank you.

29:07.899 --> 29:09.984
Susan....

29:11.902 --> 29:15.988
You got a little spot right there.
Under your chin.

29:25.871 --> 29:29.248
- Can I come in?
- What is this, Grand Central?

29:31.375 --> 29:34.002
- Are you all right?
- It's just dye, Mark.

29:34.168 --> 29:36.837
- That's not what I meant.
- It hasn't been a very good day.

29:37.004 --> 29:39.714
I know you're worried about the baby,
but it's just a cold.

29:39.881 --> 29:42.216
Rachel got them all the time.
She still gets them.

29:42.383 --> 29:45.302
You don't need to tell me
that children get colds.

29:45.468 --> 29:48.220
Doug Ross and Kerry Weaver
told me that. I get it.

29:48.387 --> 29:53.474
I didn't know you and Kerry were close
enough to be talking about Little Susie.

29:53.641 --> 29:58.311
- She told me about calling that code.
- She's irritating as hell, and you know it.

29:58.478 --> 30:00.730
- I'll admit that she has a style--
- Problem?

30:00.896 --> 30:02.981
Challenge.

30:03.482 --> 30:06.567
You'd think, on her first day,
she'd at least try and be nice.

30:06.734 --> 30:09.903
Well, maybe she thinks that way
about you.

30:11.237 --> 30:12.738
Sorry.

30:13.822 --> 30:16.241
You think you're gonna be able
to handle this okay?

30:16.408 --> 30:18.076
Do I have a choice?

30:20.577 --> 30:22.912
- Take a look.
- No, thank you.

30:23.079 --> 30:26.749
- It's great.
- It's high, which means it's scary.

30:26.915 --> 30:30.335
- Compared to what you do for a living?
- I'm very careful down there.

30:30.501 --> 30:32.586
I'm being careful.

30:33.212 --> 30:37.673
- And I'm a wimp for using a Wet-Nap?
- Now, that's different.

30:37.923 --> 30:41.092
- Oh, it's a policy kind of thing?
- Yeah.

30:41.259 --> 30:45.012
It's like whoever is driving
gets to pick the music.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.097
Except for country,
which is unacceptable.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.891
And whoever drives gets to pick
where we stop for lunch.

30:50.057 --> 30:53.768
They decide who stays in the ambo
and who goes up on the Ferris wheel.

30:53.935 --> 30:57.980
- Raul never gets to drive, does he?
- No.

30:59.856 --> 31:04.735
So if you're so afraid of heights,
what are we doing up here?

31:04.902 --> 31:08.738
I figured we should have
a little quality time.

31:10.447 --> 31:14.534
- So this is a sacrifice on your part?
- Yes, you could say that.

31:14.700 --> 31:19.621
Not to mention the sacrifice Raul is
making in staying on the ground.

31:19.788 --> 31:21.622
Who?

31:25.583 --> 31:27.501
Okay, one more time.

31:27.668 --> 31:30.003
Excuse me, Dr. Ross?

31:30.170 --> 31:32.172
Mrs. Beals?

31:34.173 --> 31:36.675
Could you excuse me
just for a second?

31:36.842 --> 31:38.676
It's not really Mrs., but that's okay.

31:38.843 --> 31:41.637
I need to make the afternoon shift,
or I'll lose my job.

31:41.804 --> 31:44.097
Byron will be okay with you, right?

31:45.306 --> 31:48.350
- You can't leave yet.
- I have to, or they'll fire me.

31:48.517 --> 31:52.270
- I'll take Byron with me.
- He has to see the child psychiatrist.

31:52.436 --> 31:57.357
He's in there with him now.
Dr. Ross, please. I really need this gig.

31:58.191 --> 32:01.151
All right, we'll watch out for Byron.

32:01.318 --> 32:03.653
- You get back as soon as you can.
- Thanks.

32:03.820 --> 32:05.696
Okay. Oh, thank you, Haleh.

32:05.863 --> 32:08.823
- When did you reach Jack Chandler?
- I haven't.

32:15.203 --> 32:18.622
- Where's my mom?
- She'll be back. Gym class, right?

32:18.789 --> 32:21.833
I don't even go to school.
I don't have to anymore.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.210
Where's my mom?

32:24.377 --> 32:27.212
Dr. Myers, can I see you
down the hall? Just for a second.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.881
Byron, we'll be right back. Okay, buddy?

32:34.134 --> 32:35.385
So this kid is a real mess.

32:35.551 --> 32:37.595
Who are you, and what
are you doing in there?

32:37.761 --> 32:39.679
Psych Resident. I'm trying to help him.

32:39.846 --> 32:42.014
You can't poach this case out of the ER.

32:42.181 --> 32:43.474
Hey, I was called down here.

32:43.641 --> 32:45.183
- By who?
- By whom. By Dr. Weaver.

32:45.350 --> 32:46.434
Chief Resident?

32:46.601 --> 32:51.521
Code red! Somebody call the damn
fire department! Rip it out! Rip it out!

32:51.688 --> 32:53.106
I got it.

32:53.273 --> 32:55.775
Byron? Byron?

32:58.693 --> 33:01.070
- Where's the kid?
- What kid?

33:01.904 --> 33:04.448
- What kid?
- Call Security.

33:05.740 --> 33:07.325
Byron?

33:09.952 --> 33:12.829
Hey, are you okay?

33:12.996 --> 33:15.205
Come here. Let me see.

33:15.372 --> 33:19.000
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Where's my mom?

33:19.167 --> 33:22.002
You kind of had me scared there
for a minute.

33:24.671 --> 33:27.381
- Where's my mom?
- We'll get your mom.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.841
- Where's my mom?
- It's okay.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.177
- Where's my mom?
- It's all right.

33:40.724 --> 33:44.143
This thing break down on you again?
Should've called me. I'd have helped.

33:44.310 --> 33:47.229
Al. You know Peter Benton, don't you?

33:47.396 --> 33:50.732
I did physical therapy for his mother
last year. My husband, Al.

33:50.898 --> 33:52.816
Yeah, you came by the house once,
right?

33:52.983 --> 33:55.485
Yeah, right. Right, yeah.

33:55.652 --> 33:59.696
- Surgeon, right?
- Resident. Well, yeah, you know....

34:00.405 --> 34:01.698
Surgical Resident.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.702
- You know anything about distributors?
- Peter's brother-in-law's a mechanic.

34:06.868 --> 34:10.579
His mother talked about
her family a lot. All the time.

34:10.746 --> 34:14.248
Sounds like my mom, doesn't it?

34:14.416 --> 34:16.500
Is there anybody you want me to call?

34:16.667 --> 34:19.668
No, no, I think we got it.
Why don't you give it a try.

34:19.835 --> 34:21.920
Yeah, okay.

34:27.257 --> 34:30.261
There you go. We got it.

34:30.427 --> 34:33.763
I gotta get her some new wheels, man.
This thing's shot.

34:33.929 --> 34:35.848
- Hey, it's good to see you again.
- Yeah.

34:36.014 --> 34:37.724
Take care.

34:56.612 --> 34:58.615
- Mrs. Beals--
- I told you, there is no Mrs.

34:58.781 --> 35:01.033
Cindy, okay? Please don't leave yet.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.035
Byron's a very sick little boy.
He needs psychiatric help.

35:04.202 --> 35:06.037
He could've burned himself up in there.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.622
I'll take him to work.
He likes that. He'll be okay.

35:08.789 --> 35:12.125
Listen, taking him to work is
not gonna solve any of his problems.

35:12.291 --> 35:14.168
Well, neither are you.

35:14.543 --> 35:17.295
Look, I really appreciate your help...

35:17.462 --> 35:19.797
...and I'll do all the follow-up
for his hand.

35:19.964 --> 35:22.507
My cousin is gonna put us up.
She's waiting in the car.

35:22.674 --> 35:26.427
She's got a bunch of kids home,
so we really do have to go.

35:42.564 --> 35:44.899
Someone gonna answer the phone?

35:45.691 --> 35:48.735
- Hey, Bob, what's going on?
- What happened to you?

35:48.902 --> 35:50.861
What do you mean?

35:52.237 --> 35:54.239
We were goofing around on that last run.

35:54.406 --> 35:57.741
You know, sticking our heads out
the window, the way dogs like to do.

35:58.909 --> 36:00.577
It's a good look, Carol.

36:00.744 --> 36:03.913
- Bob, have you seen Dr. Weaver?
- Suture Room.

36:04.079 --> 36:07.290
- The bounce-back migraine is here again.
- Not now, Jerry.

36:07.457 --> 36:10.501
I'm only trying to get you out in time
for your train.

36:10.667 --> 36:13.336
- Curtain 2.
- Thank you.

36:15.087 --> 36:18.423
We run out of Vicryl before nylon,
and lidocaine with epi is always low.

36:18.590 --> 36:19.841
And 25 days and--

36:20.008 --> 36:23.052
Kerry, would this be a good time?
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

36:23.218 --> 36:26.095
- I appreciate your staying late.
- Sure.

36:29.348 --> 36:32.559
Who gave you the right to call
a Psych Resident on one of my patients?

36:32.725 --> 36:35.102
The 9-year-old pyromaniac?
Seemed appropriate.

36:35.269 --> 36:37.771
We were waiting for Jack Chandler,
who, as you know...

36:37.937 --> 36:39.188
...specializes in children.

36:39.355 --> 36:42.649
- Chandler is not on call today.
- He was giving me a curbside consult.

36:42.816 --> 36:44.943
- He's out playing golf.
- He was gonna stop by.

36:45.109 --> 36:46.319
He owes me a favor.

36:46.485 --> 36:50.280
You're asking an extremely distraught
9- year-old and his mother...

36:50.447 --> 36:53.449
...to hang around, delay treatment,
for a chat with your buddy?

36:53.616 --> 36:56.618
Instead you send in
some prepubescent Resident...

36:56.785 --> 36:59.370
...who upsets the kid,
so he sets the curtains on fire.

36:59.537 --> 37:03.581
He set the curtains on fire
because you left him alone.

37:03.748 --> 37:05.416
Chandler comes in on a curbside...

37:05.583 --> 37:08.126
...he won't write anything
in the chart or follow-up.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.711
Where does that leave the kid?

37:09.878 --> 37:13.047
Where's he left now?
His mother took him out of here AMA.

37:13.213 --> 37:14.756
And whose fault is that?

37:14.923 --> 37:18.717
The Psych Resident wasn't managing
this case. You were.

37:22.554 --> 37:23.971
- I'm out of here.
- Doug.

37:24.138 --> 37:25.681
I said that I'm off!

37:25.848 --> 37:29.892
- Doug, come on. Wait a minute.
- Did I miss something here today?

37:30.059 --> 37:33.145
Let's just say that the last train
to Milwaukee is in 48 minutes...

37:33.311 --> 37:35.938
-...and I plan to be on it.
- So now is not a good time to tell you...

37:36.105 --> 37:39.232
...about a blunt trauma
to the chest pulling up?

37:39.399 --> 37:41.192
See you tomorrow.

38:12.340 --> 38:14.592
You okay?

38:14.758 --> 38:18.219
I'm afraid to move.
Every time I do, she starts to cry.

38:18.386 --> 38:23.056
- It's an amazing sound, really.
- Tell me about it. I got two at home.

38:23.223 --> 38:28.060
- And a new one on the way.
- Congratulations. I didn't even know.

38:28.227 --> 38:31.479
No one does.
I guess I just announced it.

38:31.646 --> 38:36.274
But when you gotta move them,
you gotta move them.

38:36.441 --> 38:38.276
Take your chances.

38:39.652 --> 38:43.363
Oh, Conni, I'm sorry about my attitude
today in that trauma.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.115
You were pretty pissy, all right.

38:46.282 --> 38:50.576
But it was worth it just to see you
take that green splash.

38:53.537 --> 38:56.623
- Here. Wanna try a handoff?
- Yeah.

39:04.712 --> 39:06.588
Shooting!

39:07.964 --> 39:10.883
We need a 12-lead EKG on him.

39:11.050 --> 39:14.969
Let this be a lesson, Daniel. Never try
to catch a running back with your chest.

39:15.136 --> 39:19.014
- I can't breathe too well here.
- Take it easy. You're gonna be okay.

39:19.181 --> 39:21.266
- It's just a bruise?
- He's hyperventilating.

39:21.432 --> 39:24.143
You would be too if you took
a helmet to your solar plexus.

39:24.310 --> 39:26.478
Get a pulse ox.

39:27.395 --> 39:30.481
- BP's falling, 70/40.
- Pulse ox is 92.

39:30.647 --> 39:32.857
Oh, great. Put him on a mask. Six liters.

39:33.024 --> 39:35.943
- Is something wrong?
- Yeah, Dan, you should've tackled lower.

39:36.110 --> 39:41.739
Blood gas is back. PO-2, 65.
PCO-2, 28. pH, 7.48.

39:41.906 --> 39:44.741
He's hyperventilating,
but his PO-2 is way too low.

39:44.908 --> 39:49.244
Shortness of breath, acute hypoxia in
an otherwise healthy 15-year-old.

39:49.411 --> 39:52.580
JVD, muffled heart sounds,
crashing BP.

39:52.747 --> 39:55.874
- Pericardial tamponade? Blunt trauma?
- It happens.

39:56.041 --> 39:59.836
What's a pericardial tamponade?
Is that something bad?

40:00.002 --> 40:02.254
I can't breathe too well. I can't breathe.

40:02.421 --> 40:03.797
- Twelve-lead?
- No time.

40:03.964 --> 40:06.340
Pericardiocentesis tray.

40:06.507 --> 40:09.384
It's a bizarre thing, Daniel,
which makes you a bizarre guy.

40:09.551 --> 40:10.844
But we like that about you.

40:11.010 --> 40:14.930
There's bleeding in the sac around
your heart, so it's not beating right.

40:15.097 --> 40:17.015
We're gonna numb the area...

40:17.182 --> 40:20.351
...and then we're gonna insert
a needle and drain the blood.

40:20.517 --> 40:22.144
You're gonna stick a needle in my heart?

40:22.352 --> 40:25.896
Don't worry, I've done it
a thousand times.

40:26.063 --> 40:29.357
- John, move in for a better look.
- Sure.

40:31.734 --> 40:37.697
I'm using a subxiphoid approach.
Forty-five degree angle.

40:38.989 --> 40:41.866
We're aiming at the left shoulder...

40:42.033 --> 40:45.286
...drawing back
as you advance the needle.

40:47.162 --> 40:49.455
- Cool.
- See, Dan, there's nothing to it.

40:49.956 --> 40:52.541
BP's coming up, 100/60.

40:52.708 --> 40:55.752
Mark, didn't you say something
about catching a train?

40:55.918 --> 41:01.339
- Oh, no. Oh, God. Thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

41:06.176 --> 41:08.511
When were you gonna tell me?

41:10.888 --> 41:14.140
I tried, Susie. I really did.

41:15.808 --> 41:20.603
Hey, I got another job for a couple days,
waitressing. Made 110 bucks.

41:24.439 --> 41:26.566
School was too hard.

41:27.650 --> 41:32.654
They had all these different programs.
You had to move this file into this file.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.822
It made me feel so stupid.

41:34.989 --> 41:37.782
All the other girls in the class
already knew how to type...

41:37.949 --> 41:42.828
...and how to write business letters.
I thought a letter was, like, a letter.

41:46.539 --> 41:48.832
They had all the right clothes.

41:48.999 --> 41:52.668
I didn't have any of that stuff,
except for what I borrowed from you.

41:52.835 --> 41:55.796
Even then, it doesn't look right on me.

41:58.006 --> 42:00.549
I really wanted this.

42:00.716 --> 42:02.884
For Susie.

42:03.051 --> 42:07.012
And to show you that I could do it.

42:16.894 --> 42:19.229
I didn't tell you...

42:19.396 --> 42:24.191
...because I knew
that I would disappoint you.

42:29.654 --> 42:34.824
And because I thought that just maybe
this time I wasn't gonna screw up.

42:40.328 --> 42:42.080
But....

42:51.795 --> 42:55.006
What happened to the waitressing job?

43:06.931 --> 43:09.058
Good night, Chloe.

43:35.786 --> 43:37.412
Hold on!

43:39.538 --> 43:41.039
Hey, wait!

43:44.667 --> 43:46.252
Damn!

44:14.731 --> 44:16.941
Enjoying the view?

44:18.609 --> 44:22.570
I'm glad you came by.
I wasn't sure you would.

44:23.612 --> 44:27.407
- I wasn't sure you'd want me to.
- No, no, no, I'm glad.

44:30.242 --> 44:34.495
Look, you know, Jeanie,
I thought I could do this, but....

44:36.789 --> 44:38.206
We can't. I know.

44:39.582 --> 44:44.878
We talked about all this before.
It's just, it's hard.

44:46.838 --> 44:48.672
Yeah, well, so is this.

44:51.675 --> 44:53.259
You gotta tell him.

44:59.055 --> 45:01.140
You gotta tell him.

45:02.305 --> 45:08.613
