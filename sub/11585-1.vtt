IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.237 --> 00:06.040
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.309
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.342 --> 00:10.111

00:10.144 --> 00:11.512

00:11.545 --> 00:13.714

THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.316
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:16.717 --> 00:21.522
NO STANDING,
7:00 AM TO 10:00 AM. YOU MORON!

00:21.555 --> 00:23.791
WE BARELY HAVE
GAS MONEY TO GET HOME,

00:23.824 --> 00:26.194
AND YOU GO AND PARK
IN A TOW-AWAY ZONE?

00:26.227 --> 00:27.428
C'MON AMY.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.662
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.664
LOOK OUT!

00:30.698 --> 00:32.500
UHH!

00:32.533 --> 00:34.268

PULL OVER TO YOUR RIGHT.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.469
DRIVER IN THE BLUE VAN,

00:35.503 --> 00:36.604
PULL OVER
TO YOUR RIGHT.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.706
[tires screech]

00:38.739 --> 00:41.609

00:41.642 --> 00:43.344

00:45.279 --> 00:47.081

01:00.728 --> 01:02.563
(on P.A.)
YOU IN THE BLUE VAN,

01:02.596 --> 01:04.365
EXIT THE VEHICLE.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.667
KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE 'EM, PALMS UP!

01:13.707 --> 01:17.445
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

01:17.478 --> 01:19.280
SON OF A BITCH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:19.313 --> 01:20.881
SOMEONE STOLE
HIS CREDIT CARD.
YOU CANCELED IT?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.883
THEY MAXED IT OUT
BEFORE I COULD.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.885
THEY'LL REVERSE
THE CHARGES EVENTUALLY.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.120
MAKE SURE YOU FILE
A POLICE REPORT.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.889
TRUST ME.
I'M GONNA GET THIS GUY.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.624
(Stabler)
HI, CAN I HELP YOU?

01:30.658 --> 01:33.194
FIRST OF ALL,
APOLOGIES.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.195
I KNOW YOU WERE
EXPECTING ME LAST WEEK,

01:34.228 --> 01:36.464
BUT I GOT HELD UP IN D.C.
ON PERSONAL BUSINESS.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.465
LONG STORY.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.532
TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT
OVER DRINKS

01:38.566 --> 01:40.834
SOMETIME AFTER WE ALL
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

01:40.868 --> 01:41.835
GREAT.
WHO ARE YOU?

01:41.869 --> 01:42.936
KIM GREYLEK.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.306
LATERAL MOVE FROM THE OFFICE
OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.407
I'M YOUR NEW A.D.A.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.210
YEAH, UH, SORRY.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.344
DETECTIVE STABLER.
SPECIAL VICTIMS.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.479
NICE TO MEET YOU ALL.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.913
(Stabler)
YES?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.615
(Benson)
THANKS, WE'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.350
(Benson)
UH-HUH.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.519
GOT ANYTHING FOR ME?

01:58.552 --> 02:01.755
UH, A CAR CHASE INVOLVING
A STOLEN VAN.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.524
THERE WAS A VICTIM INSIDE?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.459
CHRISTOPHER RYAN.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.495
OUR SEVEN-YEAR-OLD DRIVER

02:07.528 --> 02:09.163
SAYS HE HAD
TO ESCAPE

02:09.197 --> 02:11.565
BECAUSE HIS FOSTER PARENTS
WERE ABUSING HIM.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.317
I JUST GOT
IN AN ELEVATOR,

03:03.351 --> 03:04.485
SO I'M PROBABLY
GONNA LOSE YOU.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.720
I NEED YOU TO FAX--
HELLO?

03:06.754 --> 03:07.921
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.257
MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY
DOESN'T EVEN CARE

03:09.290 --> 03:10.658
IF I CATCH THIS GUY,
THEY'RE JUST GONNA

03:10.691 --> 03:12.426
COVER THEIR LOSSES BY JACKIN' UP
THE INTEREST RATES.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.328
AM I BORIN' YA?

03:14.362 --> 03:16.464
I'M SORRY--I GOT ABSOLUTELY
NO SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.465
OH REALLY?

03:17.498 --> 03:18.666
SO THE BLIND DATE
WENT WELL.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.601
UH, IT DIDN'T
GO AT ALL.

03:20.634 --> 03:21.669
I CANCELED IT.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.870
AGAIN?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.372
WHY? WHAT'S THE WORST THING
THAT CAN HAPPEN?

03:24.405 --> 03:26.707
20-BLOCK CAR CHASE
HITTING EVERYTHING IN HIS PATH,

03:26.740 --> 03:28.008
AND NOT
A SCRATCH ON HIM.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.443
NO WOUNDS AT ALL,
NOT EVEN HEALED WOUNDS?

03:29.477 --> 03:30.911
NO. HIS FOSTER PARENTS
AREN'T BEATING HIM.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.546
WELL, WHEN THE ASSAULT
IS SEXUAL

03:32.580 --> 03:34.248
THEY'RE USUALLY CAREFUL
NOT TO LEAVE MARKS.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.916
DID YOU DO
A RECTAL EXAM?

03:35.949 --> 03:37.251
TRIED--HE STARTED
KICKING AND SCREAMING

03:37.285 --> 03:38.352
BEFORE I COULD
GET CLOSE.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.020
WELL, THAT'S A RED FLAG
RIGHT THERE.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.623
HE'S IN HERE.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.824
HIS CLOTHES
ARE GONE.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.293
THEY WERE
ON THAT CHAIR.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.928
NURSE!

03:47.961 --> 03:49.697
YOU DON'T THINK
HIS FOSTER PARENTS TOOK HIM?

03:52.366 --> 03:55.669
CHRISTOPHER?

03:55.703 --> 03:58.038
HEY, CHRISTOPHER.
IF YOU'RE HIDING

03:58.071 --> 03:59.340
FROM THE DOCTOR, HE'S LEFT.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.041
HEY.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.577
IT'S A PRETTY COOL
FORT YOU'VE MADE HERE.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.012
I'M DETECTIVE STABLER--

04:05.045 --> 04:07.381
[raspberry]
GO AWAY!

04:07.415 --> 04:08.682
WELL, WE'RE HERE
TO HELP YOU.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.351
AND IT WOULD
REALLY HELP MY BACK

04:10.384 --> 04:11.319
IF WE COULD TALK
OVER HERE.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.356
[grunts]

04:15.389 --> 04:17.291
HEY.
CHRISTOPHER.
NO!

04:17.325 --> 04:18.526
SHH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.694
I DON'T WANNA GO TO JAIL!

04:20.728 --> 04:21.829
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO JAIL,

04:21.862 --> 04:23.831
BUT YOU DO NEED TO TELL US
WHY YOU TOOK OFF IN THAT VAN.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.833
I HAD TO!

04:25.866 --> 04:27.501
WELL, YOU CAN'T GO AROUND
STEALIN' CARS.

04:27.535 --> 04:30.404
WHY?
IT WAS FUN.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.339
CHRISTOPHER, YOU KNOW
HOW DANGEROUS THAT WAS?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.840
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
COULD'VE BEEN HURT?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.975
I DON'T CARE.
I LIKED IT.

04:35.008 --> 04:35.943
YOUR FOSTER PARENTS
AREN'T GONNA LIKE IT

04:35.976 --> 04:37.311
WHEN THEY HAVE TO PAY
FOR THE DAMAGE YOU DID.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.779
GOOD!
I HATE THEM!

04:38.812 --> 04:40.548
WHY, CHRISTOPHER?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.316
WHY DO YOU HATE THEM?
WHAT DID THEY DO?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.652
JUST--

04:44.685 --> 04:45.853
JUST PROMISE YOU WON'T
SEND ME BACK TO THEM.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.889
PLEASE.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.624
(Fin)
FOSTER PARENTS
ARE ON THEIR WAY UP.

04:50.658 --> 04:51.892
GWEN AND NOAH SIBERT.

04:51.925 --> 04:52.926
WELL, YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.962
SPLIT 'EM UP, SEE IF ONE'LL
ROLL ON THE OTHER.

04:54.995 --> 04:55.963
EITHER ONE HAVE A RECORD?

04:55.996 --> 04:58.432
JUST ONE.
"PUBLIC VAGARY."

04:58.466 --> 04:59.767
I THINK "MUMBLES" HERE
MEANS "VAGRANCY."

04:59.800 --> 05:01.101
NO, BUT THANKS
FOR PLAYING.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.104
"PUBLIC VAGARY"
WAS A NEO-PUNK SONG

05:04.137 --> 05:05.439
NOAH RECORDED
ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.507
NEVER HEARD IT.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.342
NO ONE DID.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.877
BUT AFTER HIS ONE NO-HIT WONDER,
HE JOINED A COMMUNE UPSTATE.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.646
NEO-PUNK TO NEO-HIPPIE.
WHAT IS HE NOW?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.114
CAPITALIST.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.351
(Gwen)
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS CHRISTOPHER?

05:17.385 --> 05:18.452
(Noah)
HE'S OKAY, RIGHT?

05:18.486 --> 05:19.353
OH, HE'S FINE.

05:19.387 --> 05:22.390
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN
SAY FOR YOUR VAN.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.091
AS LONG AS HE'S SAFE,
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.192
THE VAN'S JUST
AN OLD CLUNKER.

05:25.225 --> 05:28.028
ON WHICH YOU SPENT A FORTUNE
TURNING TO BIODIESEL.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.130
GWEN, IT'S JUST
A MATERIAL POSSESSION.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.132
(Gwen)
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST SO UPSET.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.402
I TURN MY BACK FOR ONE SECOND,
HE GRABBED THE KEYS,

05:34.435 --> 05:35.403
AND HE WAS GONE.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.505
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.839
HE'S SUCH A HANDFUL.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.408
YOU SOUND OVERWHELMED.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.743
WHAT IS THIS?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.812
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING US TO CHRISTOPHER.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.847
HE TORE A LONG PATH
OF DESTRUCTION THROUGH THE CITY.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.617
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE GOT A BOATLOAD
OF PAPERWORK TO DEAL WITH.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.019
CAN'T THAT WAIT?
OUR SON NEEDS US.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.454
YOU KNOW WHAT'D
EXPEDITE THIS?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.955
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
GO IN HERE RIGHT NOW,

05:54.988 --> 05:56.123
AND DETECTIVE TUTUOLA
CAN GO OVER THINGS

05:56.156 --> 05:57.758
WITH MRS. SIBERT
DOWN THE HALL.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.992
(Fin)
DON'T MIND
THE ACCOMMODATIONS.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.661
WE'RE A LITTLE SHORT
ON SPACE.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.764
NO, NO. WHY CAN'T WE
STAY TOGETHER?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.132
YOU THINK WE DID SOMETHIN'
TO HIM, DON'T YOU?

06:05.165 --> 06:06.133
THAT'S CRAZY.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.200
YOU KNOW,
WHEN HE CAME TO US,

06:07.234 --> 06:10.471
HE WAS ANGRY, MALNOURISHED,
AND PSYCHICALLY DAMAGED.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.006
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO LOVE HIM BACK TO HEALTH.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.708
I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY
AFFECTIONATE TOWARDS HIM.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.843
NOT IN ANY WAY THAT'S
INAPPROPRIATE,

06:15.876 --> 06:16.944
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
HINTING AT.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.580
I'M NOT HINTING
AT ANYTHING.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.048
MY WIFE GAVE UP
HER CAREER

06:21.081 --> 06:24.184
TO STAY HOME WITH THAT CHILD
AND GIVE HIM A BETTER LIFE.

06:24.217 --> 06:28.556
WELL, WHY WAS HE SO DESPERATE
TO GET AWAY FROM YOU?

06:31.058 --> 06:33.494
(Benson)
CHRISTOPHER.
CHRISTOPHER.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.529
WHOA, BUDDY.
TAKE IT EASY THERE.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.664
IT'S SO GOOD.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.501
CHRISTOPHER, YOU ALLOWED
TO HAVE SOFT DRINKS?

06:40.534 --> 06:41.535
MM-HMM.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.504
OKAY.
GIVE IT TO ME.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.605
I THINK WE NEED
TO CHECK IT OUT.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.039
NO, GIVE THAT BACK!

06:46.073 --> 06:47.508
IT'S MINE!

06:47.541 --> 06:48.909
NO, WE'RE ALL DONE
FOR THIS TIME.
NO!

06:50.511 --> 06:52.780
[grunting]
MINE! NO!

06:52.813 --> 06:53.781
CHRISTOPHER.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.483
HEY, CHRISTOPHER.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.184
NOOO!
CHRISTOPHER.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.452
THAT'S MINE!

06:58.486 --> 06:59.487
CHRISTOPHER,
HEY, HEY, HEY.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.320
CALM DOWN.
CALM DOWN.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.557
I HATE YOU!
YOU'RE STUPID BUTTHEADS!

07:03.591 --> 07:05.893
LIKE YOUR FOSTER PARENTS BECAUSE
THEY WON'T LET YOU HAVE SODA?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.228
OR CANDY OR POTATO CHIPS
OR ANY GOOD STUFF!

07:08.261 --> 07:09.229
WHAT DO THEY
WANT YOU TO EAT?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.999
THE STINKY FOOD
THAT THEY MAKE.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.602
THEY'RE VEGETABLE-TARIANS.

07:14.635 --> 07:17.137
I HATE VEGETABLES!
THEY MAKE ME PUKE!

07:17.170 --> 07:19.006
THEY'RE TORTURE!

07:19.039 --> 07:22.209
AAH!

07:22.242 --> 07:24.878
THIS IS JUST A HUGE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.947
I SWORE I'D NEVER
HURT A CHILD.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.248
I SWEAR I NEVER HAVE.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.249
DO YOUR JOB.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.185
WE'VE GOT NOTHING
TO HIDE.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.822
WHY WOULD CHRISTOPHER SAY
THAT YOU ABUSED HIM?

07:34.855 --> 07:36.924
HE'S A VERY UNHAPPY KID.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.225
NEVER KNEW HIS FATHER.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.160
HIS MOTHER HAS
REAL MENTAL PROBLEMS.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.963
SHE GAVE HIM UP
WHEN HE WAS FIVE.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.865
HE'S GOT SERIOUS
ABANDONMENT ISSUES.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.233
YOU GOTTA GET HIM
SOME HELP.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.136
YOU MEAN DOPE HIM UP
ON PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS

07:49.169 --> 07:51.271
LIKE 2/3 OF THE KIDS
IN FOSTER CARE?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.106
TRY THERAPY.
I STARTED IN UTERO.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.610
WHAT HE NEEDS

07:56.644 --> 08:00.914
IS TO FEEL MORE SECURE.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.283
I THINK WE NEED
TO FORMALLY ADOPT HIM.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.052
WE HAVE TO GIVE HIM BACK.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.589
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.057
GWEN, MOTHERHOOD'S NOT
FOR EVERYBODY.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.525
THERE OUGHT TO BE
A TEST.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.994
I ALWAYS WANTED
TO HAVE CHILDREN.

08:14.027 --> 08:17.264
NOAH WAS THE ONE WHO SAID
THAT IT WAS SELFISH

08:17.297 --> 08:20.133
WITH ALL THE UNWANTED
CHILDREN IN THE WORLD.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.669
CHRISTOPHER WAS HIS IDEA,
NOT YOURS.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.271
BUT NOAH'S NOT THE ONE
STUCK AT HOME

08:24.304 --> 08:25.773
TAKIN' CARE OF HIM,
IS HE?

08:25.806 --> 08:26.607
NO.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.211
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE UP
HIS CAREER.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.947
WE--
WE USED TO WORK TOGETHER.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.550
DOIN' WHAT?

08:36.584 --> 08:37.685
WE STARTED A, UM,

08:37.718 --> 08:39.853
LUXURY CLOTHING LINE.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.289
ECO-FRIENDLY
HAUTE COUTURE.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.559
IT'S CALLED
THE GREEN LINE.

08:45.593 --> 08:47.828
WHILE WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER,
THERE WAS ALWAYS...

08:47.861 --> 08:52.600
LOTS OF WINING AND DINING
THE BUYERS.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.301
AND NOAH'S STILL OUT THERE
LIVIN' IT LARGE,

08:54.334 --> 08:57.104
WHILE YOU'RE WRANGLING
THE TASMANIAN DEVIL.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.173
HE BREAKS THINGS.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.710
HE THROWS TANTRUMS.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.879
HE DOESN'T LISTEN
TO A WORD I SAY.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.582
AND THE CONSTANT CHATTERING.

09:08.616 --> 09:12.953
HE DOESN'T JUST...
MAKE UP WILD STORIES,

09:12.986 --> 09:17.357
HE TELLS OUTRIGHT LIES.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.760
HE'S A NIGHTMARE.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.161
NO!

09:21.194 --> 09:22.663
YOU PROMISED ME YOU WOULDN'T
MAKE ME GO WITH THEM!

09:22.696 --> 09:23.697
NO WE DIDN'T.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.332
ALL PARENTS MAKE THEIR KIDS
EAT THEIR VEGETABLES.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.700
IT'S NOT ABUSE.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.768
I KNOW!

09:27.801 --> 09:28.836
SO WHY DID YOU
PRETEND THAT IT WAS?

09:28.869 --> 09:29.837
'CAUSE I'M NOT ALLOWED

09:29.870 --> 09:31.238
TO TALK ABOUT
THE OTHER THING.

09:31.271 --> 09:32.940
OKAY, WHAT OTHER THING?

09:32.973 --> 09:36.944
IT HAS TO BE A SECRET
FROM NOAH.

09:36.977 --> 09:40.113
YOU CAN TELL US.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.283
BUT IF I TELL, GWEN WON'T
SNEAK ME ANY MORE CANDY.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.652
BUT I DON'T WANNA
GO THERE ANYMORE.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.686
GO WHERE?

09:45.719 --> 09:46.787
TO THIS PLACE.

09:46.820 --> 09:51.859
SHE SAID IT'LL MAKE ME FEEL
HAPPY, BUT IT DOESN'T.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.094
I HAD TO TAKE
ALL MY CLOTHES OFF.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.663
AND THEY GAVE GWEN MONEY.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.734
WAS IT A DOCTOR'S OFFICE?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.770
NO...A HOTEL.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.680
SO WE'RE THINKIN'
THE FOSTER MOTHER

10:12.713 --> 10:13.914
IS PIMPIN' HIM OUT?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.749
OH, IT GETS
CREEPIER THAN THAT.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.150
SHE'S DOING IT
AT THE LYDIA HOTEL.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.652
SKANK HO CENTRAL.

10:18.686 --> 10:19.820
WELL, PROBLEM IS

10:19.853 --> 10:22.189
VICE SHUT IT DOWN
EARLIER THIS YEAR,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.390
AND WE KNOW THIS KID
HAS A WILD IMAGINATION.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.426
BUT WHY WOULD A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
KNOW THIS PLACE EVEN EXISTED?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.061
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH THE BOY THAT CRIES WOLF.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.230
NOBODY PAYS ATTENTION
WHEN THE REAL ONE SHOWS UP.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.966
WHERE'S CHRISTOPHER'S
CASEWORKER?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.135
SHE WAS CALLED IN
FROM THE GET-GO, STILL M.I.A.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.070
STALL THE FOSTER PARENTS
UNTIL SHE SHOWS.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.271
LIV, YOU STAY
WITH THE KID.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.240
FIN, GRAB ELLIOT
AND GO CHECK OUT THE LYDIA.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.277
THERE A PROBLEM?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.680
YOU KNOW MY BEEF WITH STABLER.
HE'S A TOTAL HEAD CASE.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.448
I'D RATHER HAVE
ANY OTHER PARTNER.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.383
IT'S NOT LADY'S CHOICE TODAY,
DETECTIVE.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.885
SUCK IT UP, DO YOUR JOB.

10:51.919 --> 10:55.188
YOU GOT MY REQUEST FOR TRANSFER
THREE MONTHS AGO.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.423
ANY IDEA WHAT'S HOLDIN' THAT UP?

10:56.456 --> 10:58.225
NOPE.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.227
YOU SIGNED OFF ON THE 57.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.795
AND GAVE YOU
A GLOWING RECOMMENDATION.

11:01.829 --> 11:02.429
IF YOU LIKE, I'LL CALL
THE CHIEF OF D'S OFFICE,

11:02.462 --> 11:03.764
SEE WHERE IT'S AT.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.465
THAT'S GREAT.
THANKS.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.000
NO PROBLEM.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.136
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU'VE GOT AN ASSIGNMENT.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.006
IT'S NOT UP FOR DEBATE,
I'M DRIVIN'.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.207
NO, I APPRECIATE IT.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.475
MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY
JUST FAXED OVER

11:15.508 --> 11:16.877
THE STOLEN CHARGES.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.378
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME CALLS.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.180
SEE IF ANYONE CAUGHT
THE SKEL ON SECURITY CAM.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.315
IT'S YOUR WORLD, STABLER.
I'M JUST HERE TO SERVE YOU.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.350
THIS IS WEIRD.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.785
THESE GUYS USUALLY
HIT ELECTRONICS,

11:24.818 --> 11:28.321
STUFF THEY CAN RE-SELL.
THIS IS ALL WACKY STUFF.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.791
HAND-CARVED AFRICAN
TRIBAL MASK.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.225
WHAT, YOU CONSIDER
AFRICAN ART WACKY?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.762
IT'S WACKY WHEN I'M
THE ONE PAYIN' FOR IT.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.199
(Stabler)
YOU DON'T ASK FOR PICTURE ID
WITH A CREDIT CARD?

11:39.232 --> 11:41.501
LOOK, YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP,
AND I APPRECIATE IT.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.471
YEAH. JUST GET THAT
SECURITY CAMERA FIXED, HUH?

11:44.504 --> 11:45.338
ALL RIGHT.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.475
SOME DESCRIPTION.
THE GUY WAS BLACK.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.211
HAD TO BE A BROTHER
THAT JACKS YOU UP.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.880
GIRLFRIEND WAS WHITE.
LATE TEENS, EARLY TWENTIES.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.482
BOTH OF 'EM HAD ON
UNIVERSITY OF HUDSON TEE SHIRTS.

11:55.515 --> 12:01.822
I SUPPOSE YOU WANT ME TO RUN YOU
OVER TO THE CAMPUS NOW.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.824
NO, WE GOT SOMETHIN' HERE.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.361
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

12:08.395 --> 12:11.364
I'M GUESSIN' IT'S NOT
A KIDDIE SEX RING.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.833
WEIRD GROUP, THOUGH.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.904
COLLEGE KIDS?
IMMIGRANTS?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.171
BIG TURNOUT TODAY, HUH?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.340
YEAH. 'CAUSE THERE'S
NO PAIN INVOLVED.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.508
THAT'S WHY
THE MONEY IS CRAP.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.944
BUT THIS APPLICATION
STILL HAS A SECTION

12:23.977 --> 12:26.213
FOR EVERY PART
OF YOUR BODY.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.848
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.283
THE MORE ORIFICES THEY PROBE,
THE MORE IT PAYS.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.052
(Fin)
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.922
SERIOUSLY.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

12:34.955 --> 12:38.525
THIS IS A DRUG
TESTING FACILITY.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.227
NOTHING ILLEGAL.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.895
THEY DO
CLINICAL TRIALS HERE.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.364
YEAH? WHAT,
FOR LEAD POISONING?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.233
THIS ONE'S
FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.301
(Fin)
YOU GOT MS?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.102
NO.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.805
DUDE, THIS IS
A PHASE ONE TRIAL.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.041
THEY TEST IT
ON HEALTHY PEOPLE FIRST

12:54.074 --> 12:55.843
TO MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.878
WHAT IF IT'S NOT?

12:57.911 --> 13:01.281
RASH, HEADACHE,
THE RUNS...

13:01.314 --> 13:05.352
THE WORST SIDE EFFECT I EVER HAD
WAS FOR AN ALLERGY MEDICATION.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.486
MY THROAT
SWELLED SHUT.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.855
HOW MANY OF THESE
HAVE YOU DONE?

13:07.888 --> 13:09.890
LIKE 20.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.324
YOU DO MORE THAN
ONE AT A TIME?

13:11.358 --> 13:16.163
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO,
BUT PEOPLE DO.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.098
I'M IN THREE RIGHT NOW
AT DIFFERENT PLACES.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.299
ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.600
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
THESE DRUGS'LL INTERACT,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.369
PLUS YOU'RE
SCREWIN' UP THEIR DATA.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.436
NOT TO MENTION
THEIR PATIENTS.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.941
PROFESSIONAL GUINEA PIGS CAN
MAKE 70 GRAND A YEAR

13:27.975 --> 13:30.043
DOING THIS FULL TIME.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.612
I'M TRYIN' TO PUT MYSELF
THROUGH COLLEGE RIGHT NOW.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.048
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR A REAL JOB.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.617
YOU BELIEVE THEY'RE DOIN'
MEDICAL TRIALS IN THIS DUMP?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.519
GOTTA BE THE CHEAPEST LEASE
IN THE CITY.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.321
WELL, NOW WE KNOW WHY
CHRISTOPHER HATES COMIN' HERE.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.423
GWEN'S RENTIN' HIM OUT
AS A HUMAN PIN CUSHION.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.326
MIXING THE WRONG MEDS COULD
EXPLAIN HIS BIZARRE BEHAVIOR.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.195
OH, TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
MAKIN' ANOTHER CALL

13:48.228 --> 13:50.430
ABOUT YOUR LOUSY
STOLEN CREDIT CARD.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.865
NOW WHAT, YOU THINK
WE'RE GONNA CHARM

13:51.899 --> 13:54.501
CHRISTOPHER'S MEDICAL
RECORDS OFF 'EM?

13:54.534 --> 13:57.070
I'M CALLIN' SOMEONE
WHO'S ANXIOUS TO HELP.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.606
(Greylek)
SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM
FOR ALL RECORDS

13:59.639 --> 14:01.474
PERTAINING
TO CHRISTOPHER RYAN.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.510
WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.913
I'VE BEEN A DESK JOCKEY IN D.C.
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.915
DRAFTING LEGISLATION,
MAKING GRANTS.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.482
IT'S GREAT TO FINALLY BE
OUT IN THE TRENCHES.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.650
GOOD, WE APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.652
I BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND
IT'S ALL IN ORDER.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.487
YOU THINK THEY PAY ME
TO DEAL WITH CRAP LIKE THIS?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.156
LET ME GO FIND
THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.457
WE'LL LET YOU
GET BACK.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.893
MIND IF I STAY?

14:19.927 --> 14:21.228
ACTUALLY I DO.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.662
WHY?

14:22.695 --> 14:23.696
IT'S HARD TO DO

14:23.730 --> 14:26.533
OUR JOBS WITH THE D.A.
LOOKIN' OVER OUR SHOULDERS.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.667
WHY? WE'RE BOTH WORKING
FOR THE SAME THING:

14:27.700 --> 14:29.937
JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIM.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.538
BACK IN D.C.
THEY CALLED ME "THE CRUSADER."

14:31.571 --> 14:33.006
LOOK, I'M--
NICE NAME.

14:33.040 --> 14:33.640
I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY GOOD
IN THE COURT,

14:33.673 --> 14:34.541
BUT, UM--

14:34.574 --> 14:36.643
DEALING WITH SUSPECTS
OUT ON THE STREET--

14:36.676 --> 14:38.912
IT JUST REQUIRES
A DIFFERENT PEOPLE SKILL.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.915
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH WHEELING AND DEALING

14:41.949 --> 14:43.650
GOES ON IN D.C.?

14:43.683 --> 14:47.254
I'VE GOT PEOPLE SKILLS.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.488
(Receptionist)
DOCTOR EICHENBERRY

14:48.521 --> 14:50.190
WILL SEE YOU IN HER OFFICE.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.227
[sighs]

14:54.261 --> 14:57.965
DON'T WORRY ABOUT CRANKY BALLS,
HE'S ONLY NICE TO THE VICTIMS.

15:01.701 --> 15:02.802
HOLD ON.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.605
I'M MONITORING A WEEK-LONG STUDY
ON A NARCOLEPSY DRUG,

15:05.638 --> 15:08.175
AND THE SUBJECT
JUST CONKED OUT ON ME.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.176
LADY, YOU GOT
BIGGER PROBLEMS

15:09.209 --> 15:11.111
THAN THIS GUY CATCHING UP
ON HIS BEAUTY SLEEP.

15:11.144 --> 15:11.979
YOU EXPERIMENT
ON CHILDREN HERE?

15:12.012 --> 15:15.983
IN ORDER TO ULTIMATELY
HELP THEM...YES.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.050
YEAH, WELL, I HATE
TO TELL YOU,

15:17.084 --> 15:18.986
ONE OF YOUR DRUGS
CAUSES ROAD RAGE.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.288
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIDE EFFECT
IN A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.522
CHRISTOPHER RYAN.
WHAT'S HE ON?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.958
EXPERIMENTAL MED FOR ADHD.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.126
(Stabler)
WHO AUTHORIZED THAT?

15:26.159 --> 15:27.527
NOT THE KID.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.728
FOSTER MOTHER ALLOWED
TO PUT HIS HEALTH AT RISK

15:28.761 --> 15:30.130
JUST TO MAKE
A BUCK OFF OF HIM?

15:30.163 --> 15:33.000
I THINK THERE'S
SOME CONFUSION HERE.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.369
THE RULES FOR KIDS
ARE DIFFERENT FROM ADULTS.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.206
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE DISEASE
OR THE CONDITION

15:39.239 --> 15:40.373
THAT'S BEING STUDIED.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.242
CHRISTOPHER WAS ALREADY
HYPERACTIVE.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.978
SO THAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO POKE AND PROD HIM

15:45.012 --> 15:46.446
LIKE A LAB RAT.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.115
WE'RE HELPING CHILDREN,
DETECTIVE.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.382
UNTIL A DECADE AGO,

15:49.416 --> 15:51.351
KIDS WERE HARDLY EVER
INCLUDED IN THESE STUDIES.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.719
SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN,

15:52.752 --> 15:56.089
WE FOUND ABOUT 1/5 THAT LISTED
THE WRONG DOSAGE.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.624
ANOTHER 1/5
DIDN'T WORK AT ALL.

15:57.657 --> 16:01.128
AND IN 1/3, WE DISCOVERED
NEW PEDIATRIC SAFETY ISSUES.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.130
OH SAFETY. YOU'RE CONDUCTING
EXPERIMENTS OUT OF A RAT HOLE,

16:03.163 --> 16:04.631
EXPLOITING DESPERATE PEOPLE.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.567
WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORED
BY A PRIVATE REVIEW BOARD.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.038
AND EVERY TEST SUBJECT
GIVES INFORMED CONSENT.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.407
MEANING THEY ARE AWARE
OF ALL POSSIBLE RISKS.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.343
NOAH...NOAH, WAIT, LISTEN.
I CAN EXPLAIN.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.777
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU GAVE HIM DRUGS.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.647
IT WAS HIM OR ME.
I WAS AT MY WIT'S END.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.049
THEY TRUSTED US
TO HELP THIS BOY.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.050
YOU MADE HIS LIFE WORSE.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.684
I THOUGHT I WAS
HELPING HIM.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.685
WE HAD A GAME PLAN.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.087
NO, YOU, YOU,

16:27.120 --> 16:28.121
YOU HAD A GAME PLAN.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.023
THIS WAS YOUR CAUSE
OF THE MOMENT

16:30.057 --> 16:31.058
FROM THE VERY START.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.292
I NEVER HAD
ANY SAY IN IT.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.027
STOP MAKING UP STORIES,
GWEN, OKAY?

16:34.061 --> 16:35.162
JUST SHUT UP!

16:35.195 --> 16:36.729
(Gwen)
NO! YOU NEVER HAD
TO DEAL WITH HIM.

16:36.763 --> 16:37.764
HE'S DRIVING ME--

16:37.797 --> 16:40.067
(Benson)
MR. AND MRS. SIBERT!

16:40.100 --> 16:43.536
HEY, CHAMP.
HOW YA DOIN', BUD?

16:43.570 --> 16:46.639
I'M STARVING.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.809
WELL, I'D SAY YOU DESERVE
A GREAT BIG FROZEN YOGURT, THEN.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.578
I WANT CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.414
(Noah)
OKAY.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.715
CHOCOLATE IT IS.

16:57.750 --> 16:58.718
HEY.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.054
CHRISTOPHER.

17:01.088 --> 17:04.157
IF YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
IN TROUBLE AGAIN,

17:04.191 --> 17:05.525
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME
AT THIS NUMBER, OKAY?

17:05.558 --> 17:10.363
OKAY.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.168
CAN I PRESS
THE BUTTON?

17:15.202 --> 17:16.436
JUST THE ONE MARKED G.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.039
CHRISTOPHER, PLEASE.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.111
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THE SIBERTS WON'T BE

17:24.144 --> 17:26.113
CHRISTOPHER'S LAST
FOSTER PARENTS.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.315
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER KIDS
IN THIS STUDY?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.382
REPORT THE CLINIC
TO THE GROUP

17:29.416 --> 17:30.817
WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO BE MONITORING THEM.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.152
WELL, I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
THAT THIS ONE

17:32.185 --> 17:33.086
GOES TO THE TOP
OF THEIR PILE.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.655
WELL, DO IT TOMORROW.

17:35.688 --> 17:36.856
GO HOME.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.258
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE SLEEP.

17:38.291 --> 17:41.628
YEAH. OKAY.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.471
[can falls into tray]

18:03.383 --> 18:04.817
(Tonya)
HEY.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.353
OH. WHOA.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.887
I'M USUALLY MORE CAREFUL
ABOUT SNEAKING UP

18:07.920 --> 18:08.788
ON PEOPLE WHO CARRY GUNS.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.823
I'M SORRY.
I'M USUALLY NOT THIS JUMPY.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.160
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.794
WE WORKED
ON ANOTHER CASE TOGETHER.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.696
TONYA MAJESKI, A.C.S.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.198
OH, YES OF COURSE.
YOU'RE CHRISTOPHER'S CASEWORKER.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.599
YES.

18:19.632 --> 18:23.170
OH, I BROUGHT YOU
A COPY OF HIS FILE.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.804
I STOPPED BY THE SIBERTS'

18:24.837 --> 18:26.239
TO CHECK UP ON THEM.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.141
WE SCHEDULED A FEW SESSIONS

18:28.175 --> 18:30.310
TO DETERMINE
HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.381
YOU HAVE A GOOD ONE.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.482
THANK YOU.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.152
OH MY GOD.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.520
THERE A PROBLEM?

18:40.553 --> 18:45.558
CHRISTOPHER'S BIRTH MOTHER.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.893
CAITLYN RYAN.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.898
BEFORE SHE GAVE UP
CUSTODY OF HIM,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.801
SHE WAS A RAPE VICTIM.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.836
IT WAS MY CASE.

19:00.940 --> 19:01.908
CAITLYN.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.944
IT'S OLIVIA BENSON.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.880
CAITLYN, IT'S IMPORTANT.
IT'S ABOUT CHRISTOPHER.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.751
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO HIM?

19:11.784 --> 19:12.852
HE'S OKAY, BUT I--

19:12.885 --> 19:14.221
I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.455
MAY I COME IN?

19:15.488 --> 19:18.925
OH, UM, I'M NOT DRESSED,
AND THE PLACE IS A MESS.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.360
THAT'S OKAY.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.829
MY PLACE IS A DISASTER AREA,
TRUST ME.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.197
PLEASE.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.772
I MUST LOOK AWFUL.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.173
NO, YOU LOOK--
FINE.

19:36.876 --> 19:37.677
I WOULD'VE CALLED FIRST,

19:37.710 --> 19:38.578
BUT YOUR NUMBER WAS
DISCONNECTED.

19:38.611 --> 19:42.649
I HAD A REALLY TOUGH TIME
FINDING YOU.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.318
WHEN YOU MOVE, WE NEED
TO UPDATE YOUR FILE.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.553
WHY? SO YOU CAN CALL
AND REMIND ME

19:46.586 --> 19:47.987
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
FIND MY RAPIST?

19:48.020 --> 19:52.225
CAITLYN, YOUR CASE IS COLD,
BUT IT IS NOT CLOSED.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.727
I'M NOT GONNA WAKE UP
AND SUDDENLY KNOW

19:54.761 --> 19:56.629
WHAT MY RAPIST LOOKED LIKE
BEHIND HIS MASK.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.632
WE'VE CRACKED CASES
A LOT OLDER THAN THIS ONE.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.534
YEAH. WITH DNA.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.904
I SHOULDA SCRATCHED HIM
SO YOU'D HAVE SOME.

20:04.937 --> 20:05.972
I SHOULDA FOUGHT BACK,
YOU KNOW.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.841
I MEAN I WOULD HAVE,
BUT I JUST--

20:08.875 --> 20:11.210
BUT WHAT?

20:14.514 --> 20:15.915
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I LET IT GET THIS BAD.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.517
OH, PLEASE.

20:17.550 --> 20:21.288
I SLEEP ON MY COUCH QUITE OFTEN.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.590
DO YOU NEED TO HAVE THE TV ON?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.561
YOU SAID YOU CAME HERE
ABOUT CHRIS.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.531
YEAH.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.766
I--I MET CHRISTOPHER

20:33.800 --> 20:35.668
THROUGH THE SIBERTS.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.305
I WAS SURPRISED
TO FIND OUT

20:38.338 --> 20:40.340
THAT HE WAS YOUR SON--
I NEVER GOT TO MEET HIM BEFORE.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.941
WELL, HE WAS ONLY FIVE.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.611
I JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM TO KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

20:44.644 --> 20:48.014
I MEAN, MY ONLY SALVATION
IS THAT HE WAS AT A SLEEPOVER

20:48.047 --> 20:52.452
THE NIGHT THAT--
THAT THING BROKE IN.

20:52.485 --> 20:58.024
CAITLYN...

20:58.057 --> 21:00.293
WHY DID YOU
GIVE CHRISTOPHER UP?

21:03.630 --> 21:07.934
LOOK AT ME.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.938
I MEAN, AT FIRST,
I COULD FUNCTION.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.941
THEN I JUST STARTED RELIVING IT
ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.777
I COULDN'T CONCENTRATE
AT WORK.

21:17.810 --> 21:18.978
SO I LOST MY JOB.

21:19.011 --> 21:23.483
AND I LOST MY APARTMENT.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.486
AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO SLEEP.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.960
I MEAN, HE WOULD
LITERALLY LIKE, BEG ME

21:33.993 --> 21:39.532
TO FIX HIM SOMETHING TO EAT.

21:39.566 --> 21:44.771
I'D JUST LET HIM GO HUNGRY.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.474
I'M NOT A FIT MOTHER.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.977
CAITLYN.

21:51.010 --> 21:54.747
CAITLYN, LISTEN TO ME.

21:54.781 --> 21:59.018
YOU HAVE RAPE TRAUMA SYNDROME.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.921
IT'S A FORM OF PTSD.
YOU NEED THERAPY.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.623
AND WHEN YOU GET BETTER,

22:03.656 --> 22:07.427
YOU'RE GONNA
GET CHRISTOPHER BACK.
NO.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.961
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.063
WILL YOU TALK
TO A RAPE CRISIS COUNSELOR?

22:11.097 --> 22:12.999
I DID.
I JOINED A GROUP.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.101
I'VE DONE IT ALL.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.604
I GOT NOTHING.
I GOT A NEW HOME FOR CHRIS.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.839
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.140
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.476
THAT'S WHERE I MET
GWEN SIBERT.

22:23.510 --> 22:29.516
SHE WAS A RAPE VICTIM TOO.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.053
(Benson)
SO WHY DIDN'T YOUR WIFE MENTION

22:34.086 --> 22:36.923
THAT SHE WAS A RAPE VICTIM
RAISING ANOTHER VICTIM'S SON?

22:36.956 --> 22:39.091
IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH CHRISTOPHER.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.429
IT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO,
BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.996
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
OUR CASE.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.665
DID GWEN
NOT REPORT IT?

22:45.698 --> 22:46.999
CHRISTOPHER.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.568
PLAY NICE, KIDDO.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.003
UHH!

22:51.037 --> 22:54.106
SHE REPORTED IT.
WE LIVED IN JERSEY CITY THEN.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.542
THEY CATCH THE GUY?

22:55.575 --> 22:56.543
NO.

22:56.576 --> 23:01.748
AND HE BETTER PRAY
THEY NEVER DO.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.050
GWEN MET CAITLYN IN THERAPY,
BUT SHE TOLD DETECTIVE TUTUOL

23:04.083 --> 23:07.053
THAT IT WAS YOUR IDEA
TO TAKE CHRISTOPHER IN.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.888
IT WAS.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.156
GWEN TOLD ME THAT CAITLYN
WAS HAVING A ROUGH TIME

23:10.189 --> 23:13.125
RAISIN' HIM,
AND SHE SHOULDA KNOWN BETTER.

23:13.159 --> 23:14.427
I LIKE TO FIX THINGS.

23:14.461 --> 23:18.898
IT'S HOW GWEN
AND I GOT TOGETHER.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.833
AFTER SHE WAS ATTACKED,
I WENT OVER THERE

23:20.867 --> 23:22.702
TO FIX HER LOCKS,
LOOK IN ON HER.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.005
WE FELL IN LOVE.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.610
SO WHERE DO THINGS STAND
WITH CHRISTOPHER?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.479
I WANNA KEEP HIM.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.481
GWEN WANTS TO GIVE HIM BACK
TO CAITLYN.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.615
HEY.

23:35.648 --> 23:39.218
WHAT ABOUT MY MOM?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.888
UH, SHE'S STILL
KINDA SICK, CHAMP.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.691
BUT SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE
REALLY, REALLY MISSES YOU.

23:44.724 --> 23:48.127
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
SHE HATES ME.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.730
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IS SO.

23:50.763 --> 23:56.168
SHE USED TO LOVE ME.
TILL THAT MAN MADE HER SAD.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.069
THEN SHE
GAVE ME AWAY.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.005
WHAT MAN?

23:59.038 --> 24:00.172
WAS HE REAL
OR PRETEND?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.140
REAL.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.675
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

24:02.709 --> 24:07.046
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS WEARING A MASK.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.918
CHRISTOPHER WASN'T
AT A SLEEPOVER

24:11.951 --> 24:13.653
THE NIGHT THAT CAITLYN RYAN
WAS RAPED.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.221
HE WAS IN THE BEDROOM
RIGHT NEXT TO HERS.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.989
VICTIMS ALWAYS HOLD
SOMETHING BACK.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.157
I HATE THAT.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.992
USUALLY A DETAIL
THEY'RE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.227
WHY'D SHE KEEP
THAT FROM US?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.228
MATERNAL INSTINCT.
YOU TALKED TO CHRISTOPHER?

24:22.261 --> 24:24.631
YES, AND IF WE'D TALKED
TO HIM TWO YEARS AGO,

24:24.664 --> 24:27.166
WE WOULD'VE KNOWN THAT CAITLYN
BELONGED TO OUR PATTERN RAPE.

24:27.199 --> 24:31.604
(Stabler)
ANNABELLE ASHTON,
FOUR YEARS COLD.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.806
(Fin)
EMILY JOHANNSEN
IS UNDER A YEAR,

24:33.840 --> 24:35.675
BUT WE LINKED THAT
TO ANNABELLE'S,

24:35.708 --> 24:37.610
AND THERE WAS
A THIRD.
NATALIE CLAY.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.211
ALL THREE, SINGLE MOTHERS
OF A YOUNG BOY.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.179
JUST LIKE CAITLYN.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.213
MASKED, BREAK-IN RAPIST.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.314
ASIDE FROM THE RAPE,
NONE OF THEM WERE BATTERED.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.216
WELL, THEY COULDN'T FIGHT BACK,
THE PERP THREATENED

24:44.250 --> 24:45.718
TO KILL THEIR KID IF THEY DID.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.153
HE TOLD THEM ALL
THAT THEY WERE A BAD MOTHER,

24:47.186 --> 24:48.521
JUST LIKE HE DID TO CAITLYN.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.022
(Munch)
VICTIMS HAD THAT
IN COMMON,

24:50.056 --> 24:51.257
NOTHING ELSE.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.225
ADD CAITLYN TO THE PIN MAP,
SEE IF SHE FILLS IN A PATTERN.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.298
HE NEVER HIT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD TWICE,

24:59.331 --> 25:00.533
AND CAITLYN'S NO EXCEPTION.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.534
HOLD UP.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.003
EMILY JOHANNSEN WAS RAPED
IN HER APARTMENT,

25:04.036 --> 25:06.539
BUT WE LOOKED REALLY HARD
AT A BARTENDER

25:06.573 --> 25:08.207
FROM HER FAVORITE DIVE.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.544
A BLOCK AWAY
FROM CAITLYN'S APARTMENT.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.048
(Munch)
AH, THE SMELL OF STALE BEER

25:16.082 --> 25:17.950
AND QUIET DESPERATION.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.752
I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THE BAR
I OWNED IN BALTIMORE?

25:19.786 --> 25:21.187
'BOUT A KAZILLION TIMES.

25:21.220 --> 25:21.988
I'D LIKE TO OPEN ONE
UP HERE,

25:22.021 --> 25:23.990
BUT THE REAL ESTATE'S
A BIT PRICIER.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.259
HENRY WORKIN' HERE TODAY?

25:27.293 --> 25:28.728
I'M GONNA NEED INVESTORS.
YOU INTERESTED?

25:28.761 --> 25:29.896
WHAT'RE YOU SMOKIN'?

25:29.929 --> 25:31.330
COME ON, THEN WE GET TO STILL
BE PARTNERS

25:31.363 --> 25:32.832
AFTER YOU LEFT THE SQUAD.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.233
THAT IS,
IF YOU'RE REALLY LEAVING.

25:34.266 --> 25:35.635
WATCH ME.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.069
YOU KNOW, IF ONE MORE
PERSON DUMPS ME,

25:37.103 --> 25:38.237
I'M GONNA START
TAKIN' IT PERSONALLY.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.641
ASIDE FROM MY WIVES, THERE WAS
JEFFRIES, CASSIDY, MELDRICK,

25:41.674 --> 25:43.643
STAN "THE BIG MAN" BOLANDER.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.244
STAN THE MAN WAS MY MENTOR
IN BALTIMORE.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.278
JUST LIKE I AM YOURS.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.748
CIRCLE OF LIFE,
MY FRIEND.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.917
CIRCLE OF LIFE.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.019
AW, NOT YOUSE GUYS AGAIN.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.086
OKAY, HE REMEMBERS US.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.156
HOW 'BOUT HER, HENRY?

25:57.189 --> 25:59.325
NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.
SHE GET RAPED?

25:59.358 --> 26:00.593
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT RAPE?

26:00.627 --> 26:02.629
YOU DID.

26:02.662 --> 26:05.297
THE LAST 100 TIMES
YOU HASSLED ME...

26:05.331 --> 26:07.333
ABOUT THAT OTHER GIRL,
EMILY.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.235
AND I WAS TOTALLY STRAIGHT
WITH YA.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.938
FLIRTED WITH HER,
NEVER DID HER.

26:11.971 --> 26:12.939
BUT YOU INSISTED
ON CARDIN' HER

26:12.972 --> 26:14.674
EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS WELL PAST
THE DRINKIN' AGE.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.375
WHEN YOU ASK TO SEE
THE OLDER LADIES' IDS,

26:16.408 --> 26:18.310
YOU GET A BIGGER TIP.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.246
AND YOU GET TO LOOK AT THEIR
HOME ADDRESS ON THEIR LICENSE.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.781
EMILY SAT RIGHT IN THIS BAR
AND TOLD YOU

26:21.814 --> 26:23.315
EVERYTHING ABOUT HER KID.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.185
AND THE PARTY
IN MY PANTS WAS OVER.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.789
THAT'S THE REASON
I DIDN'T DO HER.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.624
THE BARTENDER HANDED ME
BACK MY LICENSE,

26:31.658 --> 26:33.025
TOLD ME THAT I LOOKED HOT
FOR MY AGE.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.661
I'M 34.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.162
AND HE PROPOSITIONED YOU?

26:36.195 --> 26:38.765
IT WAS ALL LAME INNUENDO.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.400
"BABE, YOU'RE MAKIN' MY JOB
REALLY HARD TONIGHT.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.670
YOU'RE MAKING IT HARD."

26:43.703 --> 26:45.271
AND YOU SPOKE TO HIM
FOR A WHILE.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.940
YEAH, ONLY BECAUSE
I WAS SLOSHED ON MOJITOS.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.408
I WOULD'VE NEVER LET HIM
TOUCH ME.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.411
I KNOW, EMILY, I'M JUST ASKING
IF YOU REMEMBER

26:52.444 --> 26:55.381
WHAT HIS VOICE SOUNDED LIKE.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.849
RASPY.

26:56.883 --> 27:02.388
MY RAPIST'S VOICE WAS
A HOARSE WHISPER.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.723
NO BROOKLYN ACCENT.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.425
ACCENTS CAN BE FAKED.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.427
NO, IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE

27:08.460 --> 27:11.363
FROM THE ONLINE DATING SERVICE
FOR SINGLE MOTHERS.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.732
WE CHECKED OUT EVERYONE
YOU E-MAILED.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.532
YEAH, BUT YOU NEVER

27:13.565 --> 27:15.101
FOUND THE ONE
THAT STOOD ME UP.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.069
YOU SAID HE SIGNED ON
AT AN INTERNET CAFE.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.270
PREPAID CARD.

27:18.304 --> 27:22.041
DAVE JONES?
I MEAN, IT EVEN SOUNDS FAKE.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.342
A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO EXTREMES

27:23.375 --> 27:24.944
TO PROTECT
THEIR IDENTITY ONLINE.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.379
YEAH, WELL, I SAT
AT THAT COFFEE SHOP FOR AN HOUR.

27:27.413 --> 27:32.785
SO MAYBE HE CAME,
AND HE FOLLOWED ME HOME.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.754
'CAUSE I WAS RAPED
A WEEK LATER.

27:34.787 --> 27:38.390
NONE OF THE OTHER VICTIMS
USED THAT DATING SERVICE.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.359
YOU'RE POSITIVE
IT WASN'T HENRY?

27:40.392 --> 27:42.461
NO, I NEVER
WENT INTO THAT BAR.

27:42.494 --> 27:45.031
(Benson)
AND YOU NEVER TOOK CHRISTOPHER
TO SWIM CLASSES AT THE Y?

27:45.064 --> 27:47.700
AND YOU NEVER USED AN ONLINE
DATING SERVICE?

27:50.770 --> 27:51.804
CAITLYN, PLEASE.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.440
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
I NEED YOU TO ANSWER ME.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.208
HAVE YOU?

27:56.242 --> 27:59.411
ONCE.
A FREE TRIAL SESSION.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.312
OKAY, WELL, YOU SAID
THAT YOU HADN'T.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.547
I WAS EMBARRASSED.

28:01.580 --> 28:05.251
THIS GIRL AT WORK, SHE MADE ME
GO ON THIS SITE ON HER COMPUTER.

28:05.284 --> 28:06.452
IT WAS FOR SINGLE MOTHERS.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.419
DID YOU MEET ANYBODY ON IT?

28:07.453 --> 28:09.421
NO.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.190
ONE GUY ON THERE
SOUNDED GREAT.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.793
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET
FOR COFFEE, HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

28:13.826 --> 28:17.797
I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.
I'VE NEVER DONE ONLINE DATING.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.031
NATALIE, IT'S JUST
VERY IMPORTANT.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.432
IT COULD HELP US
CATCH YOUR RAPIST.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.334
I'VE BEEN HOUNDING YOU
FOR TWO YEARS

28:22.368 --> 28:25.872
WITH EVERY HUMILIATING DETAIL
I REMEMBER.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.406
WHY WOULDN'T I TELL YOU THAT?

28:27.439 --> 28:29.441
WHAT ABOUT CHAT ROOMS?

28:29.475 --> 28:31.343
OR ANYONE YOU'VE MET

28:31.377 --> 28:32.411
WITH THE LAST NAME
OF JONES?

28:32.444 --> 28:33.412
(Clerk)
NAT.

28:33.445 --> 28:34.814
WE'VE GOT A SITUATION

28:34.847 --> 28:35.882
IN THE DRESSING ROOMS.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.817
[cell phone rings]

28:37.850 --> 28:39.485
UH, 'SCUSE ME,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.521
STABLER. YEAH.

28:42.554 --> 28:43.522
DID YOU GET A PICTURE?

28:43.555 --> 28:46.158
OKAY, GR--

28:46.192 --> 28:48.294
I'LL BE DOWN.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.863
ONE OF THE CHARGES ON MY
STOLEN CREDIT CARD?

28:50.897 --> 28:53.833
YEAH, BONNIE AND CLYDE USED IT
TO GET MATCHING TATTOOS.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.068
HIM ON THE WRIST,
HER ON THE INNER THIGH.

28:56.102 --> 28:57.169
SHOULD MAKE THE LINE-UP

28:57.203 --> 28:58.771
EASIER WHEN YOU
CATCH THEM.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.041
WHAT?

29:04.443 --> 29:08.815
LOOK AT THE DESIGNER LABEL.
THE GREEN LINE.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.951
ISN'T THAT THE SIBERTS'
CLOTHING LINE?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.454
NATALIE CLAY STARTED
DOING BUSINESS

29:15.487 --> 29:16.823
WITH THE SIBERTS
BEFORE HER RAPE.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.390
NO ONE KNEW SHE WAS SINGLE
WITH A SON.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.425
COULD BE COINCIDENCE.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.894
WHAT ABOUT THE FIRST VICTIM,
ANNABELLE ASHTON?

29:21.928 --> 29:23.963
NO CONNECTION SO FAR, BUT SHE
GOT THE HELL OUTTA DODGE

29:23.996 --> 29:25.164
AFTER HER RAPE
FOUR YEARS AGO.

29:25.197 --> 29:26.866
STILL TRACKIN' HER DOWN.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.367
(Munch)
HEY GUYS,
NOAH'S OLD PUNK BAND,

29:28.400 --> 29:30.336
PUBLIC VAGARY,
HIS BAND MATES WERE TWINS,

29:30.369 --> 29:32.404
DAVE AND DANNY JONES.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.240
HE USED THEIR NAMES
ON THE DATING WEBSITE.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.809
EMILY ANSWERED
DAVID JONES' AD.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.510
AND CAITLYN ANSWERED DAN'S.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.447
NOAH SIBERT MARRIES A RAPE
VICTIM AND THEN STARTS RAPING?

29:41.480 --> 29:43.582
RIGHT.
WOMEN WITH LITTLE BOYS.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.818
NOW THE SON OF A BITCH
IS RAISING ONE OF 'EM.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.923
FIRST YOU ACCUSE ME
OF CHILD ABUSE, NOW RAPE.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.591
WHERE DOES THIS END?

29:52.624 --> 29:53.325
WITH JUSTICE.

29:53.359 --> 29:58.865
FOR NATALIE, EMILY,
ANNABELLE...

29:58.898 --> 30:00.566
AND CAITLYN.

30:02.001 --> 30:05.271
ALL SINGLE MOMS
WORKING OUTSIDE THE HOME.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.572
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT,
DON'T YOU?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.374
NO.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.375
COME ON, NOAH.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.276
YOU FORCED YOUR OWN WIFE

30:10.309 --> 30:13.245
TO QUIT HER JOB
WHEN YOU GOT CHRISTOPHER.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.947
WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT I EVER MET CAITLYN.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.548
MONTHS AFTER SHE WAS RAPED.

30:16.582 --> 30:19.585
YEAH. THAT MUST'VE BEEN
A TURN-ON FOR YA, HUH?

30:19.618 --> 30:21.520
WIFE COMES HOME
FROM HER SUPPORT GROUP,

30:21.553 --> 30:23.990
TELLS YOU THIS POOR WOMAN'S
STORY, AND YOU'RE HEARIN'

30:24.023 --> 30:26.492
ALL THE DETAILS OF THE RAPE

30:26.525 --> 30:27.493
THAT YOU COMMITTED.

30:27.526 --> 30:28.594
MY WIFE WAS RAPED.

30:28.627 --> 30:31.230
YEAH.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.133
YOU ASK GWEN
HOW SUPPORTIVE I'VE BEEN.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.868
OH, WE KNOW HOW YOU LIKE
TO FIX THINGS.

30:35.902 --> 30:38.637
THE PLANET, DAMAGED WOMEN,

30:38.670 --> 30:40.506
NEGLECTED LITTLE BOYS.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.041
(Stabler)
JUST LIKE YOURSELF--
WE HEAR THAT YOUR MOM

30:42.074 --> 30:43.542
DIDN'T STICK AROUND
AFTER YOUR FATHER LEFT.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.978
LET'S LEAVE HER OUTTA THIS.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.314
WE KNOW YOU HAD ISSUES.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.381
YOU RAN AWAY
WHEN YOU WERE 16.

30:49.415 --> 30:50.649
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED
TO HER SINCE.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.551
DID YOU RAPE ALL THESE WOMEN
TO PUNISH MOMMY?

30:52.584 --> 30:55.154
I LEFT HOME TO JOIN A BAND.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.157
THAT FAILED SO MISERABLY,
YOU NEVER DREAMED

30:58.190 --> 30:59.458
THAT ANYBODY WOULD NOTICE
THAT YOU USED

30:59.491 --> 31:00.659
YOUR BAND MATES' NAMES

31:00.692 --> 31:03.095
ON THAT DATING WEBSITE.

31:03.129 --> 31:05.932
DANNY AND DAVE?
YEAH.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.934
SOMEONE'S USING "JONES"
AS AN ALIAS?

31:07.967 --> 31:09.501
YEAH.

31:10.937 --> 31:15.307
NATALIE I KNOW
FROM MY BUSINESS.

31:15.341 --> 31:18.177
WHAT'S MY SIX DEGREES
OF SEPARATION

31:18.210 --> 31:20.046
FROM THIS WOMAN?

31:20.079 --> 31:22.381
ANNABELLE.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.586
(Stabler)
ALL RIGHT, TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU'RE INNOCENT.

31:27.619 --> 31:31.057
DO A VOICE LINE-UP.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.594
(Greylek)
NUMBER ONE, PLEASE STEP FORWARD

31:35.627 --> 31:38.697
AND LOUDLY WHISPER
THE LINE YOU WERE GIVEN.

31:38.730 --> 31:43.002
(#1)
YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.070
NUMBER TWO.

31:44.103 --> 31:47.039
(#2)
YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.008
NUMBER THREE.

31:49.041 --> 31:53.579
(#3)
YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.714
NUMBER FOUR.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.483
(#4)
YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.385
NUMBER FIVE.

31:59.418 --> 32:01.720
(#5)
YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.656
UM...

32:04.690 --> 32:07.693
UH, IT WAS LIKE
A HARSHER WHISPER.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.528
LIKE THROATIER.

32:09.561 --> 32:12.598
NUMBER FIVE,
REPEAT THE LINE,

32:12.631 --> 32:16.468
MORE FROM THE THROAT,
A LITTLE HARSHER.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.971
(#5)
YOU'RE A BAD MOTHER.

32:19.005 --> 32:21.273
NUMBER FIVE.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.578
GREAT JOB.
COME ON.

32:28.614 --> 32:32.118
(Greylek)
SHE PICKED YOUR CLIENT,
MR. STRAUSS.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.420
BUT EMILY AND NATALIE
PICKED NUMBER TWO.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.654
I HAVE TO ADMIT.

32:35.687 --> 32:38.624
TWO'S VOICE EVEN SCARED ME.

32:38.657 --> 32:40.259
I ASSUME WE'RE DONE?
YOU ASSUMED WRONG.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.660
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.035
WHAT WAS THAT?

32:49.068 --> 32:51.037
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE CRUSADER.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.771
WE NEED TO FIND
THE 4TH VICTIM.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.705
I TAKE THIS
TO THE GRAND JURY

32:53.739 --> 32:55.707
WITH ONLY ONE OF THE THREE
PICKING NOAH,

32:55.741 --> 32:57.743
THEY'LL BLOW IT OUT,
AND THEN WE'RE FINISHED.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.155
WE'RE GOING HOME NOW.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.190
NOT WITH CHRISTOPHER.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.524
I'M HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN.
YOU HAVE NO SAY IN IT.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.792
WELL, HIS CASEWORKER DOES.
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.794
(Caitlyn)
CHRISTOPHER?

33:15.827 --> 33:18.130
OH, MY GOD.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.032
YOU'VE GOTTEN SO BIG.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.600
YOU WORTHLESS BITCH.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.668
CAITLYN, GO BACK
INTO THE SQUAD ROOM.

33:22.701 --> 33:23.669
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.104
YOU MISERABLE INGRATE.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.173
AFTER ALL WE'VE DONE FOR YOU,
YOU LYING BITCH!

33:27.206 --> 33:28.774
FIRST YOU SADDLE ME

33:28.807 --> 33:30.509
WITH THIS MESSED UP
LITTLE KID--
(Noah)
GWEN--

33:30.542 --> 33:32.744
AND THEN YOU MAKE THESE
RIDICULOUS ACCUSATIONS

33:32.778 --> 33:33.945
TOWARDS MY HUSBAND.

33:33.979 --> 33:36.248
WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I WAS JUST HERE FOR A LINE-UP.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.249
I HATE YOU!
I HATE YOU!

33:37.283 --> 33:38.750
CHRISTOPHER...
YOU LEAVE HER ALONE!

33:38.784 --> 33:41.420
SHE'S MY REAL MOM,
NOT YOU!

33:41.453 --> 33:43.655
FINE...FINE.
TAKE HIM BACK!

33:43.689 --> 33:44.823
OH, TAKE HIM BACK.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.359
THAT IS THE BEST REVENGE
I CAN WISH ON YOU.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.061
YOU RAPED ME.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.629
(Gwen)
YOU'RE SICK.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.264
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A LIAR.
(Noah)
GWEN,

33:52.298 --> 33:54.100
LET'S GO NOW.
DON'T.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.374
HEY, CHAMP.

34:02.408 --> 34:05.077
I'M NOT ABANDONING YOU.

34:05.111 --> 34:07.146
I'M GONNA FIGHT
TO GET YOU BACK, OKAY?

34:07.179 --> 34:09.115
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,
RIGHT?

34:15.787 --> 34:16.688
IT'S ALL SLOBBERY.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.790
YEAH, I KNOW IT IS.
DON'T TOUCH YOUR CHEEK.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.160
DON'T TOUCH YOUR CHEEK.
ALL RIGHT, COME WITH ME.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.299
(woman)
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.600
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF WE GET DNA.

34:28.634 --> 34:29.668
(Cragen)
THANKS.

34:29.701 --> 34:30.869
NOT THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING
TO COMPARE IT AGAINST.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.171
THIS GUY'S BEEN CAREFUL.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.173
MAYBE HE WASN'T
WHEN HE FIRST STARTED.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.308
OH, CHRISTOPHER.

34:37.609 --> 34:41.347
I'M SO SORRY.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.150
I'M GONNA DO WHATEVER I CAN
TO MAKE THIS UP TO YOU, OKAY?

34:44.183 --> 34:46.818
HOW COME YOU
GAVE ME AWAY?

34:46.852 --> 34:49.855
WHY DIDN'T YOU WANNA
BE MY MOM ANYMORE?

34:54.560 --> 34:58.197
I NEVER STOPPED
WANTING THAT.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.532
I JUST--

35:00.566 --> 35:02.668
MOMMY'S BEEN VERY SICK,
OKAY?

35:02.701 --> 35:06.672
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO GET BETTER, OKAY?

35:06.705 --> 35:08.740
SO I CAN BE A GOOD MOM.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.576
OKAY.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.843
I LOVE YOU.

35:11.877 --> 35:14.513
I LOVE YOU TOO.

35:16.182 --> 35:17.216
HI, TONYA.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.286
PLEASE.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.688
PLEASE CAN I TAKE HIM HOME?

35:22.721 --> 35:25.657
AS SOON AS WE CAN SHOW THE COURT
THAT IT'S A SAFE ENVIRONMENT.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.695
DON'T CRY, MAMA.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.864
IT'LL BE OKAY.

35:32.898 --> 35:37.135
I PROMISE YOU IT WILL BE.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.712
THOSE PEOPLE STARVED ME
TO DEATH.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.614
I NEED A HAMBURGER
RIGHT NOW.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.618
OKAY. COME ON.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.624
YOU'LL GET HIM BACK.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.295
I'M AFRAID I GOT
SOME BAD NEWS.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.463
WHAT NOW?

36:04.496 --> 36:06.332
I HEARD BACK
FROM THE CHIEF OF D'S OFFICE.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.700
YOU KNOW A GREG BURKLE?
OH, NO.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.769
WHO'S THAT?

36:10.802 --> 36:12.404
GUY I USED TO WORK WITH
BACK IN NARCOTICS.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.973
AFTER HIS WIFE DIVORCED HIM,
SHE STARTED CALLIN' ME.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.608
DAMN.

36:16.642 --> 36:17.476
WELL, GREG'S
AT ONE-P-P NOW.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.579
HE'S IN CHARGE
OF PROCESSING TRANSFERS.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.814
GUESS I'M NOT GOIN'
ANYWHERE SOON.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.516
WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU COULD NEVER LEAVE ME.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.685
CAPTAIN, FIN AND I WERE
THINKIN' OF GOIN' IN ON A BAR.

36:26.718 --> 36:27.419
YOU WANNA BUY IN?

36:27.453 --> 36:28.487
WELL, GEE, JOHN,
I DON'T KNOW.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.423
LET ME RUN IT BY THE GUYS
AT MY NEXT AA MEETING.

36:31.457 --> 36:32.658
(Stabler)
YUP!

36:32.691 --> 36:33.625
I REACHED OUT
TO A FRIEND OF MINE,

36:33.659 --> 36:36.595
HE'S ON SECURITY AT HUDSON U.,
GOT MY GUY.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.496
HE'S RUNNIN' HIM OVER NOW.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.565
IF ANYTHING BREAKS,
JUST COME GET ME.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.468
(Kathleen)
DAD.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.303
KATHLEEN.
WHAT'RE YOU DOIN' HERE?

36:44.336 --> 36:45.837
YOU HAD MY BOYFRIEND ARRESTED?
WHAT THE HELL?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.540
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.609
TONY DIDN'T
STEAL YOUR CREDIT CARD.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.578
I HAD TO BUY SOME BOOKS
FOR SCHOOL,

36:52.611 --> 36:54.813
SO I BORROWED IT
WHEN I WAS HOME ON SUNDAY.

36:54.846 --> 36:58.617
YOU DIDN'T BUY ANY BOOKS.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.686
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.288
WELL, I DO,
AND YOU BETTER MAKE IT RIGHT.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.256
I'D BETTER MAKE--
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

37:04.290 --> 37:05.657
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?!

37:05.691 --> 37:06.892
EL.

37:06.925 --> 37:10.829
TONY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

37:10.862 --> 37:13.299
WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS NOW.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.533
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GET THAT THING

37:14.566 --> 37:15.667
REMOVED FROM YOUR LEG!

37:15.701 --> 37:16.935
YOU HAVE A TATTOO.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.842
WHAT DO YOU GOT, LIV?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.512
I FOUND OUR FOURTH VICTIM.

37:26.545 --> 37:29.681
ANNABELLE ASHTON.
SHE MOVED BACK TO IOWA

37:29.715 --> 37:32.518
AFTER HER RAPE.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.754
SHE KILLED HERSELF
LAST YEAR.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.791
IF WE'D FOUND
NOAH EARLIER--

37:39.825 --> 37:41.393
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

37:41.427 --> 37:42.428
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

37:42.461 --> 37:45.631
LOOK, YOU CAN'T
DO THIS TO YOURSELF.

37:45.664 --> 37:47.699
YOU CAN'T GO THERE.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.337
(Munch)
HEY, GUYS.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.572
WE GOT A HIT
OFF NOAH'S DNA.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.609
(Gwen)
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO US?

37:57.643 --> 37:59.478
THIS IS CRAZY.
HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.546
IT WAS HIM.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.513
IT WAS THE ONLY TIME
HE LEFT DNA.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.482
AFTER THAT HE STARTED
COVERING HIS TRACKS.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.050
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.352
LISTEN TO ME.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.719
THE DNA FROM YOUR RAPE KIT

38:07.753 --> 38:09.355
WAS ENTERED INTO CODIS
FIVE YEARS AGO.

38:09.388 --> 38:10.756
THE MATCH WAS CONFIRMED.
NOAH RAPED YOU.

38:10.789 --> 38:11.890
NOAH.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.759
NOAH, TELL THEM
THAT THEY'RE WRONG.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.394
TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE WRONG.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.329
BABY, WHY AREN'T YOU
TELLING THEM THAT THEY'RE WRONG?

38:17.363 --> 38:20.499
GWEN, LISTEN TO ME.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.668
YOU NEED TO TELL THEM
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.771
WHAT?

38:25.804 --> 38:27.739
THAT YOU FILED
A FALSE POLICE REPORT.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.977
OH, GOD, NO.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.813
THE SEX WE HAD
WAS CONSENSUAL.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.948
NO...NO.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.985
GOD, NO.

38:40.018 --> 38:43.789
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I MARRIED--

38:43.822 --> 38:46.692
I MARRIED MY OWN RAPIST?

38:46.725 --> 38:48.627
I LOVED YOU.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.630
YOU NEVER HAD THE TIME OF DAY
FOR ME BEFORE THAT.

38:51.663 --> 38:52.631
IT ALL TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.901
I MADE YOU FEEL SAFE,
YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH ME.

39:04.943 --> 39:08.714
DO YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW?

39:10.849 --> 39:13.485
UNH!
OHH!

39:13.519 --> 39:15.521
SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

39:22.961 --> 39:26.398
NOAH SIBERT ACCEPTED
THE PLEA DEAL.

39:26.432 --> 39:27.933
SURPRISED YOU OFFERED HIM ONE--
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DYIN'

39:27.966 --> 39:29.568
TO STRUT YOUR STUFF
IN THE COURTROOM.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.102
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.805
THERE WERE A LOT OF TRAUMATIZED
VICTIMS IN THIS CASE.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.941
NOW, THEY WON'T BE DRAGGED
THROUGH A TRIAL.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.543
SO WHAT'S HE GET?

39:37.576 --> 39:38.910
THE MAX.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.712
YOU ARE GOOD.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

39:40.746 --> 39:42.814
THREATENED HIM WITH A PENALTY
ENHANCEMENT OF 25 YEARS.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.182
HOW?

39:44.215 --> 39:48.787
THE NEW YORK HATE CRIME STATUTE
COVERS RACE, COLOR,

39:48.820 --> 39:51.623
SEXUAL ORIENTATION,
RELIGION, AND GENDER.

39:51.657 --> 39:54.726
NOAH TARGETED
A SPECIFIC SUBSET OF WOMEN.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.127
MOST RAPISTS DO.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.596
HE ACTUALLY BELIEVED
YOU COULD CHARGE HIM

39:57.629 --> 39:58.830
WITH RAPE AS A HATE CRIME?

39:58.864 --> 40:00.031
NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE
TO PULL THAT ONE OFF.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.701
HE KNOWS I INTEND
TO BE THE FIRST.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.471
I WASN'T BLUFFING.
IT'S MY PET PROJECT.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.606
MAYBE ON THE NEXT ONE.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.577
SO, HOW DOES THIS WORK?

40:11.610 --> 40:14.079
DO WE ALL GO OUT
FOR A CELEBRATORY DRINK?

40:14.112 --> 40:15.914
WELL, IF WE HAD A BAR,

40:15.947 --> 40:16.915
DRINKS WOULD BE
ON THE HOUSE.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.951
WHERE'S OLIVIA?

40:19.985 --> 40:22.087
(Olivia)
IT HAPPENED FOUR MONTHS AGO.

40:22.120 --> 40:26.825
I WAS, UM,
WORKING UNDERCOVER

40:26.858 --> 40:29.828
IN A PRISON, AND--

40:29.861 --> 40:31.830
AND A MALE GUARD
TRIED TO RAPE ME.

40:31.863 --> 40:35.667
AND I WAS--

40:35.701 --> 40:41.239
I WAS OKAY AT FIRST,
AND THEN--

40:41.272 --> 40:46.912
I'VE STARTED RELIVING IT.

40:46.945 --> 40:51.950
JUST FEEL REALLY JUMPY,
AND I CAN'T SLEEP.

40:51.983 --> 40:56.955
AND I FEEL
VERY OUT OF CONTROL.

40:56.988 --> 41:01.693
AND THE THING IS THAT
I WASN'T EVEN RAPED.

41:01.727 --> 41:02.928
OLIVIA...

41:02.961 --> 41:04.996
YOU WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

41:05.030 --> 41:08.534
HE CAME SO CLOSE,

41:08.567 --> 41:11.202
AND THERE WAS NOTHING
THAT I COULD DO TO STOP HIM.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.172
HE HAD A WEAPON.

41:14.205 --> 41:18.877
AND HE COMPLETELY
OVERPOWERED ME.

41:18.910 --> 41:24.082
AND I NEVER SHOULD'VE LET HIM
TAKE ME DOWN THERE.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.984
'CAUSE I KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.020
RAPE VICTIMS
OFTEN BLAME THEMSELVES.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.689
YOU KNOW HOW MISPLACED
THAT BLAME IS.

41:30.722 --> 41:35.761
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I KNOW THAT HERE.

41:35.794 --> 41:40.932
I'VE TOLD THAT SAME THING
TO A LOT OF WOMEN.

41:40.966 --> 41:45.704
BUT NOW I...

41:45.737 --> 41:48.574
I FEEL...

41:48.607 --> 41:52.010
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T DESERVE
TO BE HERE.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.613
I FEEL LIKE--

41:54.646 --> 41:57.783
I FEEL LIKE HE HAS--

41:57.816 --> 42:00.552
HE STOLE SOMETHING FROM ME.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.994
AND...

42:09.027 --> 42:11.597
AND I NEED HELP
DEALING WITH IT.
