WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:04.342
The Miss's caught me eating
one of her chocolate bars

00:04.343 --> 00:07.225
out of the cleaning lady's vagina.
Hello, darling.

00:07.226 --> 00:09.822
You fucking fuckface!

00:09.823 --> 00:12.653
I would like you to meet
the poet and philosopher...

00:12.654 --> 00:15.133
- Holy shit, that's Marilyn Manson
- Marilyn Manson.

00:15.134 --> 00:17.828
We are talking about doing
a duet together.

00:17.829 --> 00:20.669
Maybe tour of the States.
That would be really something, right?

00:20.670 --> 00:22.259
I'm just here for the narcotics.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.848
- We're getting married!!
- The Runkles!

00:24.849 --> 00:28.531
I'll fucking marry you Fuckers
on stage at the Greek!

00:28.532 --> 00:30.100
Fuck Yeah, why not?

00:30.101 --> 00:32.347
- You guys are coming on Tour, Right?
- What?

00:32.348 --> 00:34.100
We gotta keep writing this musical.

00:34.101 --> 00:37.765
If we are not together, I don't expect you
to have taken some vow of celibacy.

00:37.766 --> 00:40.285
Karen, you want me not to see
anybody else, just say the word.

00:40.286 --> 00:44.511
I decided to go abroad, for an
indeterminate amount of time.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.844
I want to make a
literary pilgrimage.

00:48.559 --> 00:49.959
Watching her go, I don't know...

00:49.960 --> 00:51.973
It kinda feels like
the end of something.

00:51.974 --> 00:56.102
Makes you wonder if she was the only thing
that was still keeping us together.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:05.737 --> 01:07.909
How can you even debate this shit?

01:08.513 --> 01:13.244
Go. Hit the road, don't look
back, you fucking idiot.

01:13.245 --> 01:14.677
Right, what if...
What if...

01:14.678 --> 01:17.416
You've lived your entire adult life
according to "what if".

01:17.417 --> 01:20.009
What if the one you think is "the
one" is not really "the one"?

01:20.010 --> 01:24.206
What if you shut your fucking piehole
and pour me another drink?

01:24.207 --> 01:25.928
You came to see me.

01:25.929 --> 01:28.278
Yeah, but I can't help
where my dreams take me.

01:28.279 --> 01:30.511
Yeah, but what do you dream
about when you get there?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.477
That says a lot.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.711
What the fuck is wrong with that ass?

01:38.843 --> 01:41.445
Nothing.
She's pretty amazing.

01:41.446 --> 01:43.821
In some way, she's perfect for me.

01:43.822 --> 01:45.715
The eternal dilemma, isn't it?

01:46.576 --> 01:50.144
"Home, sweet home" vs. "the wild
cold world outside your door".

01:51.539 --> 01:54.497
You know which way you chosen,
you died to regret it.

01:54.498 --> 01:56.602
Says who?
It's not even me talking.

01:56.603 --> 01:58.754
You know that.
I just ask the questions.

01:58.755 --> 02:01.306
Why are you so afraid
to give up and let go?

02:02.528 --> 02:07.134
It's ok, Hank.
We tried and we failed.

02:08.031 --> 02:09.970
It's not the end of the world.

02:09.971 --> 02:12.587
But, if I gave up on us,
what would I have left?

02:13.618 --> 02:15.353
The rest of your life.

02:15.354 --> 02:16.783
Hank.

02:19.114 --> 02:20.574
You OK?

02:22.581 --> 02:24.700
Just a wet dream

02:24.701 --> 02:27.974
Why on earth are you packing so early?

02:27.975 --> 02:30.586
Well, first of all, it's noon

02:31.244 --> 02:35.888
And second, I'm still leaving
after the show tonight

02:37.111 --> 02:39.539
Which brings us to the real question

02:39.540 --> 02:41.758
Should I be packing for two?

02:42.567 --> 02:44.249
Cause I'm pretty sure

02:44.250 --> 02:48.549
I could fit in a multitude of
black T-shirts and jeans and...

02:54.016 --> 02:58.920
Or I could be possibly
persuaded to come back to bed

02:58.921 --> 03:02.270
And postpone packing

03:04.913 --> 03:06.524
Be more persuasive

03:06.525 --> 03:08.085
Are you pushing my head now?

03:08.086 --> 03:09.851
- Oh my god!
- Just a little bit.

03:16.894 --> 03:20.179
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:49.470 --> 03:52.926
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:06.721 --> 04:09.521
And... I'm hard!

04:09.522 --> 04:10.938
Thanks, Hanky.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.234
Let me check..

04:13.235 --> 04:15.832
You're a liar.
And I love you for it.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.949
That's hardly appropriate.
Sorry, naughty smurf.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.810
She's not married yet.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.641
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

04:22.642 --> 04:26.109
- Why are you trying to talk her out of it?
- Yeah, why you be trying to talk me out of it?

04:26.110 --> 04:29.729
Charlie and Marcy Runkle are the
Fred and Ethel Mertz of our time

04:29.730 --> 04:31.335
They belongs together.

04:31.336 --> 04:33.287
That's right.
And if you'll excuse me,

04:33.288 --> 04:38.666
Ethel has to make yellow while Lucy and
Ricky discuss their issues and what not.

04:41.924 --> 04:44.863
So I've... I've a chance to
go with Atticus on the road.

04:44.864 --> 04:47.155
- Yeah?
- And I thought maybe...

04:48.533 --> 04:50.792
You would wanna talk about it,
talk, I don't know.

04:50.793 --> 04:53.030
I shouldn't even factor into your decision

04:53.031 --> 04:54.667
But you do, you always do.

04:55.816 --> 04:57.228
Well... Hank, what do
you want me to do?

04:57.229 --> 05:01.852
I mean... to say:
"Oh, please, stay!"

05:01.853 --> 05:03.531
Let's live happily ever after

05:03.532 --> 05:05.733
I can't do that.
Do you want my permission?

05:05.734 --> 05:09.535
I mean, you're a big boy. You're gonna make
your own decision about it, anyways.

05:09.536 --> 05:13.756
Besides, I... I thought you're in a
relationship with someone.

05:16.959 --> 05:18.822
Well, maybe that's what's
good for you then,

05:18.823 --> 05:21.162
like a non-relationship relationship.

05:21.163 --> 05:23.305
Cause you have a hard time functioning

05:23.306 --> 05:26.165
within the confines of a traditional one.

05:26.166 --> 05:29.509
Well, it was never anything
traditional about us

05:30.436 --> 05:32.643
Have you heard from our
literary pilgrim?

05:32.644 --> 05:35.922
No, only what she puts up on Instagram.

05:37.273 --> 05:38.735
What's Instagram?

05:38.736 --> 05:42.537
Ok, you guys working shit out?

05:43.870 --> 05:45.884
You back together?

05:45.885 --> 05:48.721
I guess not.
Ok, here's the deal:

05:48.722 --> 05:52.874
Me and CW Runks are gonna do this thing.
And do you know why?

05:52.875 --> 05:56.063
- No, why?
- Because we're gonna be fucking happy.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.708
- And you know why?
- Why?

05:57.709 --> 06:02.245
Because it's better than being
fucking miserable all the time.

06:02.246 --> 06:04.124
This whole time we've been out here

06:04.125 --> 06:08.957
it's been like a midlife crisis roller coaster ride.
And it's fucking over!

06:08.958 --> 06:13.471
Now. So let's all just
live happily ever after.

06:13.472 --> 06:16.423
Ok? Good?
It's settled?

06:16.424 --> 06:18.294
Good!

06:28.277 --> 06:29.709
What's going on?

06:29.710 --> 06:32.460
Atticus's had to sell the
plane to fund the tour

06:32.461 --> 06:35.665
And the record company ain't giving him
the kind of support they used to.

06:35.666 --> 06:38.088
And no thanks to that nutjob missus of his,

06:38.089 --> 06:41.026
he's having some serious
cash flow problems.

06:41.027 --> 06:42.700
We're back to touring by bus.

06:42.701 --> 06:44.941
- Where is that fucking ginger?
- He's in the bedroom.

06:44.942 --> 06:46.873
He wants to talk with someone
who understands

06:46.874 --> 06:48.295
what it's like to live with heartbreak

06:48.296 --> 06:51.193
I told him, you know,
I've got lots of experience,

06:51.194 --> 06:53.560
but no, he doesn't care, he wants you.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.396
Hey Atticus!

06:57.397 --> 06:59.212
What's up rock star?

06:59.213 --> 07:01.155
I can't play the gig tonight, Hank.

07:02.274 --> 07:04.155
Why is that?

07:04.156 --> 07:05.687
I went home this morning,

07:05.688 --> 07:09.113
and got down on bended knee,
and asked Natalie to take me back.

07:09.114 --> 07:11.288
And she told me to fuck off.

07:11.289 --> 07:14.213
She's really done with me,
which is understandable

07:14.214 --> 07:16.462
given my behavior.

07:16.463 --> 07:20.866
But I've never done an opening night
without a good luck kiss from her.

07:20.867 --> 07:25.926
Back in the early day, she used to give me this really
comprehensive blow job, like balls and all, you know?

07:26.695 --> 07:28.938
Although, I was usually too wired to come.

07:28.939 --> 07:31.272
That's a cute story, buddy.

07:31.273 --> 07:34.149
But I'm afraid the big rock show must go on

07:34.150 --> 07:39.390
But I haven't been on a bus
in well over 10 years.

07:39.391 --> 07:42.345
It's so embarrassingly bargain basement.

07:42.346 --> 07:46.321
Are you kidding? That bus
out there, that's beautiful. That bus.

07:46.322 --> 07:49.005
- Really, you like it?
- Yes, I love it. It's bad ass.

07:49.006 --> 07:51.480
- It's cool?
- It's so cool.

07:51.481 --> 07:53.203
It's like a land airplane

07:53.204 --> 07:55.651
It's gas friendly, eco-friendly

07:55.652 --> 07:57.833
You'll probably get an award for that shit.

07:59.264 --> 08:01.252
- How do you do it, Hank?
- Do what?

08:02.223 --> 08:04.235
The woman that you love is out there

08:04.236 --> 08:06.637
and you know you can't have her.

08:06.638 --> 08:09.861
How do you even get up in the morning?

08:09.862 --> 08:12.931
Booze is always helpful

08:13.895 --> 08:16.037
So is the art.

08:16.038 --> 08:21.695
Everything that I write
is either for her, or about her, so

08:21.696 --> 08:24.898
I'm with her, even when I'm not,

08:24.899 --> 08:26.688
in my writing.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.714
That's very moving, Hank.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.566
- Don't cry!
- Why?

08:34.567 --> 08:38.240
It's unbecoming.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.674
You said something moving,
why shouldn't I cry?

08:40.676 --> 08:42.779
What about your aussie blockiness?

08:42.780 --> 08:46.955
Or your British stiff upper lip.
Whatever the fuck you are.

08:46.956 --> 08:49.586
I think you should come
on tour with me, Hank.

08:49.587 --> 08:52.955
I feel like if we finish our
master piece,

08:52.956 --> 08:55.956
our rock opera about love,

08:57.007 --> 08:59.753
maybe we'll both end up with the girl

09:01.339 --> 09:03.107
I'll think about it.

09:06.794 --> 09:08.289
In the meantime.

09:08.290 --> 09:10.996
Are you ready to rock out,
or do you cock out?

09:31.771 --> 09:33.653
I'll admit this is pretty cool.

09:33.654 --> 09:36.626
It's like Disneyland every day

09:36.627 --> 09:39.301
Yeah. Without the morbidly obese
running around in scooters

09:39.302 --> 09:41.893
Even the concept of time
is different, you know,

09:41.894 --> 09:46.844
it's rock and roll fucking
summer camp forever.

09:46.845 --> 09:51.026
- It's got to end at some point, doesn't it?
- Says who?

09:51.027 --> 09:54.818
All roads lead back home eventually

09:54.819 --> 09:57.501
Sounds like a Country song

09:57.502 --> 10:00.301
Hey. You're Faith, right?

10:00.302 --> 10:02.379
Yeah, that's me.

10:02.380 --> 10:05.355
I'm Vince, from Mysstery.

10:05.356 --> 10:08.102
Two s's. We're opening the show tonight

10:08.874 --> 10:11.382
Well... Hey, Vince from Mistery
with to s's

10:11.383 --> 10:14.071
- Good luck up there.
- Cool, thanks.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.067
I'm wondering if maybe you
want to come hang on our bus

10:17.068 --> 10:19.054
It's the one that says
"Cat Club"

10:19.055 --> 10:21.902
We call it that because
chicks who want to come on

10:21.903 --> 10:24.540
we ask them to pee on this
litter box we keep by the front door

10:24.541 --> 10:28.059
This way we know for sure that
they're willing to party

10:28.060 --> 10:29.971
I'm free, I got a full bladder.

10:29.972 --> 10:32.809
I don't think you'd have
to do that, though

10:32.810 --> 10:34.829
because you're pretty famous

10:34.830 --> 10:37.790
Thanks for the preferential
treatment and all, no thanks

10:37.791 --> 10:40.882
What? We're not big enough
for the legendary Faith?

10:40.883 --> 10:42.664
No, no, it's not like that at all

10:42.665 --> 10:45.473
But if you're gonna be a dick about it,
I can just come clean

10:45.474 --> 10:46.874
You're just not really that talented

10:46.875 --> 10:49.404
I've heard your album
and it's really shitty mall metal

10:49.405 --> 10:51.556
So, if I were you, I would
just quit now

10:51.557 --> 10:53.877
and maybe Hot Topic will hire
you back this summer

10:53.878 --> 10:56.213
Wow, you're kind of a bitch!

10:56.214 --> 10:59.452
Hey, watch your manners, son.
That's no way to talk to a lady.

10:59.453 --> 11:01.524
Fuck off, dad.

11:01.525 --> 11:03.273
You know what this calls for?

11:03.274 --> 11:04.736
Titty twister!

11:25.394 --> 11:27.953
Good evening, Los Angeles!

11:27.954 --> 11:29.921
You wanted the best?

11:29.922 --> 11:33.769
Well I got stuck in the traffic
coming on the fucking hill.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.329
From London, England,
by way of Mars

11:36.330 --> 11:38.697
The Bacardi Concert series presents:

11:38.698 --> 11:41.626
Atticus Fucking-Fetch!

12:07.581 --> 12:11.265
Good luck out there.
Not that you need it.

12:11.266 --> 12:14.450
You're a fucking rock star

13:22.510 --> 13:24.549
A long way from church, eh?

13:24.550 --> 13:26.590
Are you kidding me?

13:53.428 --> 13:56.647
Do you, bald fucking wanker,

13:56.648 --> 14:00.366
take this sexy little tree stump

14:00.367 --> 14:03.767
to be your immortal beloved?

14:03.768 --> 14:06.444
I most certainly do.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.125
Do!

14:09.265 --> 14:11.836
Right.
And do you,

14:11.837 --> 14:13.757
delicious little spinner

14:13.758 --> 14:16.093
with whom I have shared
a sexual encounter

14:16.094 --> 14:19.534
which will sustain me
well into my golden years,

14:19.535 --> 14:21.652
take this...

14:21.653 --> 14:24.642
sweaty hairless pinhead

14:24.643 --> 14:28.854
to be the very last
sexual parter of you entire life?

14:28.855 --> 14:30.798
Jesus!...

14:32.809 --> 14:35.167
Well, when you put it like that...

14:36.063 --> 14:38.847
Let's do(ce) it.
I do(ce) it.

14:44.632 --> 14:47.712
Good.
Let's get on with it.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.559
By the power vested on me

14:53.560 --> 14:56.999
by the Sun Kill Moon ministry
of Northern California

14:57.000 --> 15:00.016
I now pronounce you wife
and man

15:09.893 --> 15:13.204
Now, while we're here,
does anyone else feel like getting wedded

15:13.205 --> 15:17.097
on this glorious, glorious LA evening?

15:17.098 --> 15:20.591
Anyone?

15:21.689 --> 15:24.159
Anyone?

15:24.160 --> 15:25.717
Karen

15:35.231 --> 15:37.902
Karen, be with me.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.942
Spend the rest of your life
with this fool,

15:39.943 --> 15:44.806
and this fool will spend the rest of
his life making sure you don't regret it

15:46.016 --> 15:48.052
What do you say, babe?

15:48.053 --> 15:51.230
- Say Yes!
- Will you be my wife?

15:51.231 --> 15:53.807
Come on!
Say yes!

15:58.348 --> 16:00.782
No?
Nobody?

16:01.405 --> 16:02.955
Really?

16:04.888 --> 16:10.134
No? Then get the fuck off my stage.
Be gone, all of you!

16:14.284 --> 16:16.917
I wrote this next song
for my wife, Natalie

16:16.918 --> 16:20.189
in hope that she'll forgive me

16:20.190 --> 16:23.362
although if she did, I'll probably
just bugger it up all over again

16:24.414 --> 16:27.858
But tonight I'm gonna play it
for my good friend and collaborator

16:27.859 --> 16:32.399
Hank Moody. Who knows a thing
or two about heart break himself

17:26.041 --> 17:29.497
- Wait, you look familiar.
- Hank Moody

17:29.498 --> 17:30.898
- Come on
- Manson

17:30.899 --> 17:33.460
Thank you for coming to
my fucking mother show

17:33.461 --> 17:34.955
Hi, Brian.

17:35.356 --> 17:37.504
Actually, I'm surprised that you came

17:37.505 --> 17:40.239
I just want to make it clear,
I was just fucking with you.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.129
I would not give drugs to your daughter.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.067
Because I need them for later.

17:45.068 --> 17:46.545
But wait. How is the kid?

17:46.546 --> 17:48.294
- She's great.
- Good, good.

17:48.295 --> 17:50.795
Would you get her to send me the
picture of me tea-bagging Atticus?

17:50.796 --> 17:52.907
- Will do
- Because I want to put that on my Facebook

17:52.908 --> 17:54.396
Will do

17:55.373 --> 17:58.254
And if you guys aren't together
I would pee in your butt

17:58.255 --> 18:00.094
What?!

18:01.426 --> 18:03.746
It's Becca.

18:03.747 --> 18:06.418
- Hey sweetie
- Hi, dad

18:06.419 --> 18:10.285
- How's the road treating you?
- It's so beautiful out here, dad.

18:10.286 --> 18:12.430
I'm having the time of my life

18:12.431 --> 18:16.566
- And tomorrow we leave for Europe
- Glad to hear it

18:16.967 --> 18:22.526
- Are you happy, Dad?
- That's a loaded question

18:22.527 --> 18:25.767
I was just thinking about
what I want for all the people in my life

18:25.768 --> 18:29.002
And I realized that I just
wanted you to be happy

18:29.003 --> 18:31.997
I want to see you smile
and know you mean it

18:33.583 --> 18:36.812
- are you high right now?
- Significantly

18:36.813 --> 18:39.027
We just smoked some killer weed.

18:39.028 --> 18:40.428
Of course you did

18:41.498 --> 18:44.029
Be careful

18:44.030 --> 18:47.658
And have fun, just not too much

18:47.659 --> 18:49.059
Don't worry, dad

18:49.060 --> 18:51.225
All roads lead back home

18:51.226 --> 18:53.776
That sounds like a Country song

18:54.661 --> 18:58.403
- I love you, dad
- I love you too, sweetie

18:58.804 --> 19:01.651
Would you do me a favor and
send Manson

19:01.652 --> 19:04.184
that photo of him tea-bagging Atticus

19:04.185 --> 19:06.434
Ok, will do

19:06.435 --> 19:08.607
Ok, sweetie, I love you

19:19.816 --> 19:21.473
I'm coming with you

19:25.711 --> 19:29.416
That makes me so very happy

20:12.681 --> 20:16.090
Good for you, man.
You made the right decision

20:16.091 --> 20:19.077
Besides, even if you actually had the balls
to do it, and she actually said yes

20:19.078 --> 20:22.617
- what would you have done?
- I would've married her right then and there.

20:23.018 --> 20:25.399
And then, what? You would have fucked
like rabbits for a couple days,

20:25.400 --> 20:27.693
you would have had some sweet little
pillow talk, and then one day she would

20:27.694 --> 20:30.844
ask you to go to Home Depot with her.
Party is over

20:31.245 --> 20:33.952
You know, you talk a good game,
but I was with you when you died

20:33.953 --> 20:37.960
and you were about to do it. You were gonna take
one last shot at the love of your life, buddy.

20:37.961 --> 20:41.268
Sure, I would have given it a try. Maybe I
could even got her back in the sack again.

20:41.269 --> 20:43.519
But eventually, you get out of bed.

20:43.520 --> 20:48.268
You're still you. All the problems
you've ever had, they're still there.

20:48.269 --> 20:49.957
So you're just supposed to give up?

20:49.958 --> 20:52.117
It's not about giving up.
It's about letting go.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.870
Finally accepting who you are.

20:56.007 --> 20:57.646
Guess who

21:00.578 --> 21:03.431
God, I can't wait for her to die
and come down

21:08.038 --> 21:09.590
Karen?

21:12.625 --> 21:14.098
Karen!

21:27.234 --> 21:29.771
You have to go, don't you?

21:30.998 --> 21:32.829
Yeah, I do.

21:34.158 --> 21:36.317
I'm sorry, I do.

21:40.038 --> 21:41.554
Don't be.

21:50.517 --> 21:53.150
You just don't know what you're
gonna be missing.

21:53.151 --> 21:54.554
I do.

21:54.955 --> 21:56.955
That's what makes it is so hard.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.769
- I could love you, you know.
- Faith...

22:03.770 --> 22:08.208
I'm... I'm not saying that I do.

22:09.434 --> 22:13.202
I'm saying that I could.

22:14.144 --> 22:18.475
Which is rare for me,
and deserves to be acknowledged

22:19.491 --> 22:24.562
You understand me, better than
any guy I've ever met

22:25.435 --> 22:27.261
You get me.

22:28.886 --> 22:34.093
And that has been the nicest feeling

22:37.898 --> 22:39.362
I'm just saying.

22:39.363 --> 22:42.936
And I'm just saying that you're
pretty fucking amazing.

22:43.337 --> 22:46.639
And I hope you find what
you're looking for out here.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.671
I hope you find what you're
looking for out back there

22:51.356 --> 22:53.923
I'll even say a prayer for you.

22:53.924 --> 22:57.826
Just not a very big one

22:59.511 --> 23:03.527
- I hate saying goodbye to you
- Then don't

23:04.541 --> 23:06.181
You know what?

23:06.582 --> 23:10.838
The great thing about
never really being together:

23:10.839 --> 23:13.586
never really have to break up

23:14.917 --> 23:18.390
Hank, get the fuck out of here

23:18.391 --> 23:22.473
Before I wrap my legs around you
and convince you to stay.

23:22.474 --> 23:25.051
And you know I can do it.

23:53.816 --> 23:55.278
What is this? Wow what?

23:58.079 --> 24:00.608
- What's going on?
- Hank's got to go

24:00.609 --> 24:02.872
He's got to see a horse about a girl

24:02.873 --> 24:06.027
Is this about following your bliss?

24:06.912 --> 24:09.291
That what we were talking
about in bed yesterday?

24:09.292 --> 24:12.727
- Is it about love?
- It is

24:12.728 --> 24:14.259
Then you must go.

24:15.429 --> 24:17.135
I can't turn the bus around,

24:17.136 --> 24:19.380
but I can send an emissary.

24:28.713 --> 24:30.683
Sorry, crying again.

24:30.684 --> 24:33.068
Don't be sorry. It's unbecoming.

24:36.015 --> 24:41.302
All right, you. Go. My work here is done.

24:44.303 --> 24:47.455
I really see to you happily ever after

25:44.137 --> 25:46.388
I know he means a great deal to you,

25:46.389 --> 25:48.577
as he does to me.

25:48.578 --> 25:53.281
And I just want you to know that
I'm here for you, if you need me

25:53.282 --> 25:55.768
Emotionally,

25:55.769 --> 25:57.594
spiritually,

25:57.595 --> 25:59.960
and obviously sexually.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.288
Thank you, Atticus

26:03.289 --> 26:04.700
I'm serious, darling.

26:04.701 --> 26:07.878
Sometimes and orgasm can
relieve heartache

26:07.879 --> 26:10.082
I've done a lot of research
in the area

26:10.083 --> 26:13.429
Can I at least get a good luck kiss?
I do have a gig tonight, you know.

26:13.430 --> 26:15.543
I'm a bit nervous

26:58.252 --> 27:01.178
I know you're not one for
emoting, Krull,

27:01.179 --> 27:02.609
but thank you

27:02.610 --> 27:04.462
I had a girl once

27:04.463 --> 27:06.423
love of my life she was

27:06.424 --> 27:09.490
Fucked it up, of course.

27:09.491 --> 27:11.659
I thought there'd be time.

27:11.660 --> 27:14.357
Turns out, it's just roads

27:14.358 --> 27:17.715
Long and paved potholes

27:17.716 --> 27:20.001
I read that once in a book.

27:20.696 --> 27:22.945
Go and get her, pal

27:37.426 --> 27:42.154
