You've been here all night?

Yes, Antonio.

00:38.496 --> 00:39.998
- How are you?
- Actually, I...

00:39.998 --> 00:41.750
I... I go by Torpedo now.

Oh, okay. Cool, cool, cool.

- [laughing] Oh.
- Yeah. What's going on?

00:45.295 --> 00:48.006
Did I hear correctly?
Are you throwing that party next week?

00:48.006 --> 00:49.716
Can you believe I got Jowell

00:49.716 --> 00:50.800
- to show up here?
- [gasps]

00:50.800 --> 00:52.677
And I'm only paying him 400 grand.

What a steal!

I know. I mean, you know.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.934
Listen, um, I just came up
with this random idea

00:59.934 --> 01:01.644
just out of nowhere, just now.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.022
You remember Santi, right?

Oh, yeah, that's the, um,
the "Exagerao" guy, right?

01:06.858 --> 01:09.152
- Yeah, but he has way other stuff, too.
- Mmm.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.989
And I think he just
became available that night.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.159
- Mmm.
- Oh, a Jowell and Santi pairing?

01:16.159 --> 01:18.745
- I can get him to do a song or two.
- Nah, I'm good.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.539
I mean, I got Jowell.
[laughing] I don't need your guy.

I didn't really wanna do this

Santi open up for Jowell,

with your eight-hour shifts?

- They look confused.
- Mmm-hmm.

I can break a--

just please don't talk to them again.

You have a job. You're my manager.
What are you talking about?

I know. Now I have two jobs
and one actually pays me.

You guys never have to worry
about me getting a job.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.014

I expected that
we were gonna sign a little earlier.

and I don't know if it's gonna
lead to them touring together,

07:32.577 --> 07:34.662
but if a journalist would document it,

07:34.662 --> 07:36.497
it would make for an amazing story.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.958
What would I be documenting exactly?

07:38.958 --> 07:43.254
Santi. You'd be documenting Santi,
the next big thing in reggaeton.

- Right.
- [laughs] Yeah.

What are we saying?

09:32.071 --> 09:33.322
What's up, guys?

09:33.322 --> 09:35.658
I have a show tomorrow night
at Club Essence.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.703
Y'all should pull up.
Jowell's gonna be there. It'll be lit.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.246
Uh, who are you?

09:40.830 --> 09:41.747
- I'm--
- He's Santi.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.084
Yeah. I don't know who that is.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.877
He's the guy who sings "Exagerao."

09:46.877 --> 09:49.297
Oh, yeah, that track is dope, dude.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.632
- Thank you, bro.
- I didn't know that

09:51.632 --> 09:55.052
guys like you do, like, legit shows.
That's cool, though.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.888
Wait, what you mean, "guys like me"?

09:57.888 --> 10:00.641
- You know, like, Internet singers?
- [Santi] No.

10:00.641 --> 10:04.353
No, no, no.
I'm not some, like, Internet singer.

10:04.353 --> 10:07.315
I write my own music,
I produce my own songs,

10:07.315 --> 10:08.858
I perform my own stuff--

10:08.858 --> 10:10.693
Bro, don't get so defensive.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.320
No, I'm not being defensive.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.113
- I was just explaining--
- [Joaquin] Okay!

10:14.113 --> 10:15.448
His vibes are whack.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.617
Whack? I'm not whack.

10:18.868 --> 10:23.080
Two of those three women over there
said they wanted to have sex with me, so...

10:23.080 --> 10:24.206
Two of three!

10:28.419 --> 10:29.670
Let's talk to that group.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.048
They seem like thirsty,
mid-level influencers.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.343
Bruh, I really don't feel like
talking to anyone right now. I just...

10:36.052 --> 10:37.219
I wanna head home.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.847
Yeah, let's just go home. Fuck this.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.806
Well, actually...

10:42.058 --> 10:43.142
I need to be alone.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.311
I need to prep for my performance.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.189
Yeah, that's... Yeah. Makes sense.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.651
Text me when you're safe.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.575
[chiming]

11:11.087 --> 11:12.672
- What?
- Oh, my God.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.132
Did you guys get this message? Like, what?

11:15.132 --> 11:18.469
Santi? Who the fuck is that asshole?

11:18.469 --> 11:20.471
[indistinct chatter]

11:22.014 --> 11:23.015
[Oscar] So, his, uh...

11:23.015 --> 11:25.059
His agency has clients we want.

11:25.059 --> 11:28.771
I'm supposed to make him feel valued
before we fuck them.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.190
Like telling a girl
she's smart so you can...

11:31.190 --> 11:33.776
- Fuck her.
- Hey, you said it, not me.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.152
[laughs]

11:35.152 --> 11:36.946
Mia. Hi.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.280
Oh, dear God.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.532
I saw you on AirDrop.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.617
Uh, Mia, I just wanna say thank you

11:41.617 --> 11:43.202
so much for hooking Santi up

11:43.202 --> 11:45.371
with the Jowell show. We're just so hype.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.709
- Mia. You're hooking up shows?
- [Mia] No.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.169
- I don't even... That's not what--
- [Felix] Sorry.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.254
I'm interrupting.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.131
No, not a problem.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.925
I'm happy Mia could help you.
She's so good at that.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.176
Yeah.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.721
She schedules all my meetings,
picks up dry cleaning.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.557
She's the best assistant
I've ever had. In years.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.685
- Mmm-hmm. Best... Best assistant?
- Yeah.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.938
You know, Mia was working at a nail salon

12:10.938 --> 12:12.606
before I gave her this job.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.734
- Isn't that funny, Mia?
- [laughing]

12:14.734 --> 12:16.152
- It's so funny.
- So funny.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.779
- Look, um, obviously, this boy...
- Uh...

12:18.779 --> 12:20.823
- ...is very confused.
- I'm a grown-up.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.200
And I'm gonna go help him
find his parents.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.870
Sorry, he needs a little help.
So funny, this child.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.330
- [clears throat]
- [Felix] Wait, so, what... Uh...

12:28.330 --> 12:30.374
- Oh, my God.
- Relax! Relax!

12:32.793 --> 12:33.836
You're an assistant.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.629
I'm a dreamer,

12:36.213 --> 12:37.173
a hustler,

12:38.299 --> 12:39.800
and an assistant.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.886
- Oh, fuck.
- For now.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.721
Okay, so you completely lied to us.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.557
Wow. That's just like trust shattered.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.185
Okay, it's just a little insane.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.770
Yeah, a little insane.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.938
Can your boss at least sign Santi?

12:52.938 --> 12:56.692
Maybe I should talk to him. I felt like
we had a pretty decent vibe going.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.403
- Okay, he could. But why would he?
- Mmm.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.781
He signed some of the biggest talent
in the world

13:01.781 --> 13:03.783
and he barely gives them a call back.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.159
Santi would get no attention,

13:05.159 --> 13:07.411
and it would do nothing for his career.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.954
Why did you lie to us?

13:08.954 --> 13:11.457
Because you wouldn't
take me seriously otherwise.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.626
Santi needs me.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.170
He needs somebody who believes in him,

13:16.170 --> 13:18.714
somebody who's gonna wake up at 2:00 a.m.,

13:18.714 --> 13:20.591
talk to some douche named Torpedo

13:20.591 --> 13:22.968
just so he can perform in front of Jowell.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.137
No one else is gonna do that but me.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.473
What do you want me to say?

13:27.473 --> 13:31.393
"Oh, you're about to have
a potentially career-altering performance,

13:31.393 --> 13:35.022
but the person helping us
turns out to be a total fucking fraud."

13:35.022 --> 13:37.733
That's why you're not
gonna say anything to Santi.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.318
You can't say anything, Felix.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.529
No. I can't lie to Santi.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.949
Ness? Sure. But Santi is my <i>hermano.</i>

13:45.783 --> 13:48.369
- I'm sorry. You're a liar.
- Don't take that phone out.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.329
- You deserve this.
- Stop texting.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.831
- What're you doing?
- [clatters]

13:51.831 --> 13:52.748
Help!

13:53.541 --> 13:54.375
Or...

13:54.959 --> 13:57.086
this could be a secret between me and you.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.674
Ugh!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.509
What the hell are you doing?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.388
That was amazing.

14:07.388 --> 14:11.851
I truly learned a lot. I know that
everybody else here really enjoyed it.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.395
Um, and thank you to our fantastic panel

14:14.395 --> 14:18.899
and to everyone for joining us. <i>Gracias.</i>

14:18.899 --> 14:20.150
[applause]

14:27.908 --> 14:30.077
- Excuse me, Celeste?
- Hey.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.204
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.040
Yeah, I know it's strange,
I'm coming up to you again.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.125
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:36.667 --> 14:41.547
[clears throat] Look, uh, I'm weird.
Okay, no, no. I'm passionate. Passionate.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.883
And, um, sometimes
the wires get crossed, but...

14:43.883 --> 14:46.051
But please don't hold that against Santi,

14:46.051 --> 14:50.723
because he, truly, he's so talented,
and, uh, he deserves this opportunity,

14:50.723 --> 14:53.517
and I really believe
that there is no one else

14:53.517 --> 14:55.436
that could cover him like you could.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.439
Hmm. Why is that?

14:59.481 --> 15:02.234
Well, I read your stuff every day,
and I mean,

15:02.234 --> 15:05.946
the way you write about artists,
it's like no one else in the game.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.198
I mean, you don't do fluff pieces

15:08.198 --> 15:10.117
and... And you don't have an agenda.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.161
That's why the community
respects you so much.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.456
Respects me enough to follow me
to one of my events?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.292
[laughing] And you're funny!

15:19.501 --> 15:20.336
May I?

15:21.462 --> 15:22.796
- Sure.
- Okay, look...

15:24.214 --> 15:25.424
Um...

15:25.424 --> 15:28.260
the other day,
you asked me why Santi was different,

15:28.260 --> 15:30.387
and I couldn't really respond. Um...

15:30.387 --> 15:32.848
He's just... He's got this thing. It's like...

15:33.515 --> 15:36.101
It's like this spark on stage.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.687
[groans] It's really hard to explain
unless you see it,

15:38.687 --> 15:42.066
which is why I need you to see it
and explain it.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.610
He's not a one-hit wonder.
He's the real deal.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.154
I mean he made "Exagerao" in one evening.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.282
You're a really persistent person, huh?

15:50.282 --> 15:53.285
Yeah. My friends call it finessing.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.039
Fi-Ness-ing.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.208
'Cause my name's Ness.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.085
Oh!

16:02.086 --> 16:04.046
Yeah, I didn't know that was your name.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.591
I didn't... Right.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.514
- [exhales deeply]
- [door closes]

16:14.473 --> 16:15.307
Hey.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.518
- [Santi] What's up?
- 'Sup?

16:20.187 --> 16:21.981
So, where you been?
We've been calling you.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.482
Just making some music.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.277
It just hit me
that this show really has to work.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.530
Yeah, and it will.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.658
It better be because it's the only thing
that I'm good at.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.910
That's not true at all.

16:34.910 --> 16:38.872
All right, so name one job
that I could do that's not this.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.125
- Uh...
- Oh...

16:41.125 --> 16:42.084
[Ness] Okay.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.002
[clicks tongue]

16:43.002 --> 16:45.087
You're kind of putting us on the spot.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.673
- And there are so many.
- Like a...

16:47.673 --> 16:49.383
- Like a... Yeah.
- Personal trainer.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.803
- Who also has an OnlyFans.
- Well...

16:52.803 --> 16:55.472
Okay? So both of you, right,

16:55.472 --> 16:56.974
have amazing skills

16:56.974 --> 16:59.893
that can be used in this business
in several different ways.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.061
But I don't.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.355
If this show doesn't work,

17:04.940 --> 17:06.400
I can't make a living.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.028
And I've got no safety net.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.572
Okay, but that stuff
doesn't actually matter

17:11.572 --> 17:15.242
because you're gonna kill it,
like we've seen you do a million times.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.661
Yeah, but I've never done it alone.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.205
I can't do it alone.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.541
What are you talking about?
We'll be there.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.127
Yeah. In a sea full of Jowell fans
that are annoyed

17:25.127 --> 17:28.005
that some Internet singer
is performing and not him.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.882
Since I was a kid,

17:29.882 --> 17:31.800
every single time I produced a beat,

17:32.384 --> 17:35.304
made a song, performed in front of people,

17:35.304 --> 17:37.347
you guys have always been beside me.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.768
I could just look you in the eyes
and know that it's gonna be okay.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.603
And I feel like I need that.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.397
Goddamn, man, that's beautiful.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.733
Hey, we're gonna be there.

17:48.859 --> 17:52.279
Right there. Even if you can't see us,
we will be there with you.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.364
Okay?

17:54.364 --> 17:55.908
["Wepa" playing]

18:12.091 --> 18:13.842
So, how you feeling?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.594
I'm feeling good.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.262
<i>Todo bien.</i>

18:17.262 --> 18:20.140
So, you're not freaked
about your one and only shot?

18:20.140 --> 18:22.101
- What the fuck? Why remind him?
- Ow!

18:22.101 --> 18:25.521
It's not like he forgot it's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for him

18:25.521 --> 18:27.314
to do the only thing he's good at.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.607
Ow!

18:28.607 --> 18:29.566
Um...

18:30.234 --> 18:33.987
[in English] I was freaked out, okay?
I... I still kind of am,

18:33.987 --> 18:36.448
but since being here,

18:36.448 --> 18:39.743
- I've felt like... Like weirdly calm.
- [Ness] Mmm-hmm.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.912
Hearing the music right now,

18:41.912 --> 18:43.705
knowing that this is my moment,

18:43.705 --> 18:47.751
I feel like this is everything that
we've been waiting for. Like it's--

18:47.751 --> 18:49.670
- We know.
- Destiny.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.631
I wasn't gonna say that.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.675
Really? What were you going to say?

18:55.425 --> 18:57.886
Something really cool.
I guess you'll never know.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.513
Right. [chuckles]

19:00.055 --> 19:01.181
[knock on door]

19:01.765 --> 19:03.559
- Five minutes, guys.
- Great, thank you.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.269
[door closes]

19:05.269 --> 19:10.399
Okay, well, uh, I guess that
we should head out.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.153
[all squealing]

19:14.153 --> 19:15.529
[Ness laughing]

19:16.613 --> 19:18.157
- Thank you, guys.
- [patting on back]

19:18.157 --> 19:20.200
I wouldn't have done it without you.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.369
- My heart's, like, pounding!
- What?

19:22.369 --> 19:24.037
Think Santi's gonna crowd-surf?

19:24.037 --> 19:27.082
I hope he doesn't have stuff
in his pockets. It's dangerous.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.084
[Ness laughs awkwardly]

19:31.003 --> 19:32.254
What is going on?

19:32.254 --> 19:34.631
- I don't... I don't know.
- Hey!

19:35.591 --> 19:38.218
- Over here!
- Hey. [laughs]

19:38.218 --> 19:40.512
There's like ten people in the crowd
