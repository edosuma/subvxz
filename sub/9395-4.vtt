01:40.350 --> 01:41.286
Mom!

01:44.318 --> 01:45.880
Mom, did you forget to pay the water bill?

01:45.977 --> 01:48.106
No, of course I paid the water bill.

01:51.204 --> 01:55.301
See? This is what we need the emergency Visa for. Something must’ve broken.

01:55.404 --> 01:57.686
I’ll take care of it. Come on, lets get you rinsed.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.767
How is this funny, Mom?

02:04.895 --> 02:06.693
How is this not funny?

02:11.838 --> 02:15.237
Hey. Check it out. It’s called ‘dinner.’

02:15.980 --> 02:17.803
Who is that lady? Is that my wife?

02:19.519 --> 02:21.233
I didn’t think you were getting back until Monday.

02:21.392 --> 02:25.781
I wasn’t. Until I sweet talked Ziodex into doubling their ‘Gift to AIDS’ research.

02:26.071 --> 02:28.120
It took me all of one meeting.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.962
Wow, I’m impressed.

02:31.254 --> 02:33.959
You sure you don’t want to quit saving the world and come sell cars with me?

02:34.437 --> 02:36.645
Mmm, thanks, but I like the Frequent Flyer miles.

02:38.129 --> 02:40.019
Hey. How’s my boy?

02:40.464 --> 02:42.922
- I have warm-ups, Mom.
- Oh, come on, sit.

02:43.188 --> 02:45.697
Dinner’s almost ready and I haven’t seen you from weeks.

02:45.779 --> 02:47.985
I can’t. I got to go. Don’t wait up.

02:48.267 --> 02:50.121
Nathan. Remember what I told you.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.891
He can’t shoot if he doesn’t have the ball.

02:55.063 --> 02:59.429
Damnit, this is a team, not a Chinese fire grill.

02:59.587 --> 03:03.888
Scott, you’re plain selfish. Get out there and pretend you know each other.

03:04.329 --> 03:08.501
- All right, lets try to get it together.
- Ravens on three. One! Two! Three! Ravens!

03:09.822 --> 03:11.195
Lets go, lets go, lets go!

03:11.277 --> 03:13.222
Hey, can I catch a ride with you to Nathan’s party later.

03:13.313 --> 03:14.390
I didn’t think you were going.

03:14.636 --> 03:16.920
I figured you’d be hiding out in Lucas’ back seat again.

03:17.012 --> 03:18.204
- Jealous.
- No.

03:18.444 --> 03:23.769
What? I could see it. You’re both so broody. You could brood together.

03:25.849 --> 03:28.300
Now the Ravens in bound with the ball.

03:28.377 --> 03:31.926
Looks like they’re trying to isolate Nathan Scott on the baseline.

03:32.109 --> 03:35.054
The Masenberg defense tightens on him. Scott battles through,

03:35.105 --> 03:39.129
still working hard to get open down there. Now Tim Smith, with the ball,

03:39.190 --> 03:42.913
working over on the wing. He’s dribbling, looking for Nathan underneath,

03:42.959 --> 03:45.668
but he’s not there. And now- Oh! Oh!

03:45.755 --> 03:49.488
A cross court pass putting Lucas Scott over the basket.

03:49.661 --> 03:54.203
So much for the putty grip on that one as the Ravens fall back on the bench.

03:54.254 --> 03:59.077
And I tell you what, Lucas Scott is really starting to gel with this team.

04:01.561 --> 04:04.007
He had a better angle. I’m sorry.

04:04.873 --> 04:08.017
Nathan, come on, Man. I’m just trying to win.

04:09.230 --> 04:10.771
So are you excited?

04:11.498 --> 04:12.712
What? That we won?

04:12.778 --> 04:16.685
No, because there’s running water in the locker room. We’re gonna be roughing it until tomorrow.

04:17.361 --> 04:18.187
It’s okay...

04:20.208 --> 04:20.858
What’s up, Dad?

04:28.861 --> 04:29.966
Nice game, sweetie.

04:30.356 --> 04:31.539
Try telling that to Dad.

04:37.681 --> 04:39.546
Two decent games in a row, man.

04:40.202 --> 04:41.450
Getting better or just lucky?

04:44.805 --> 04:47.257
Team’s got a party tonight. My parents’ beach house.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.245
Why are you tell me that?

04:48.952 --> 04:50.273
Because I said the team, didn’t I?

04:53.084 --> 04:57.779
Look, it’s kind of the off season. Might as well deal with it.

05:48.143 --> 05:52.620
The guys kidnapped you, trashed your court, threatened you with bodily harm.

05:53.347 --> 05:55.938
Party, yeah. Sure, why not?

05:56.035 --> 05:58.124
Okay, listen, I know it’s all a setup, alright?

05:58.901 --> 06:01.447
But I’m not gonna let him screw with me. Whatever he dishes out he’s going to get back double.

06:03.709 --> 06:09.054
Do you think maybe- I mean, just maybe- he’s had a change of heart?

06:09.291 --> 06:11.549
Hmm. That requires a heart.

06:20.832 --> 06:24.062
Every time I ride with you, I swear I’m never going to do it again.

06:29.117 --> 06:29.905
Keys?

06:30.918 --> 06:31.926
Tempt fate.

06:32.346 --> 06:36.406
Peyton. You’ve got to talk to him. Lucas had the better shot. You saw it, right?

06:36.580 --> 06:39.028
Tim? Are you being pathetic?

06:43.255 --> 06:44.357
What’s he doing here?

06:45.346 --> 06:48.454
I invited him. I mean, since you guys are such great friends now.

06:50.789 --> 06:51.744
What are you trying to pull?

06:52.551 --> 06:53.574
Nothing.

07:01.915 --> 07:02.765
I wasn’t sure you’d come.

07:03.978 --> 07:04.972
That makes two of us.

07:05.637 --> 07:07.199
Hi. I’m Nathan Scott.

07:07.665 --> 07:09.309
Um, yeah, I know, I’m Haley.

07:20.162 --> 07:21.725
Tonight’s gonna be great.

07:32.042 --> 07:34.945
Well. I bet their plumbing works.

07:36.016 --> 07:37.209
I’m just saying...

07:37.716 --> 07:38.728
- Alright, thanks.
- Yeah.

07:38.979 --> 07:40.241
Have you guy’s seen this?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.837
The High School Fearleader. It’s a comic strip.

07:47.147 --> 07:48.595
Wait, this is insulting, right?

07:49.782 --> 07:51.242
My dog can draw better than this.

07:52.502 --> 07:54.744
Really, what guy keeps his hat on during sex?

07:56.397 --> 07:58.180
Who is this socky person anyway?

07:59.853 --> 08:00.908
Yeah, I wonder.

08:02.802 --> 08:05.644
It’s just a stupid comic strip. Who cares, right?

08:05.799 --> 08:08.999
It’s more like sucky. Whoever it is doesn’t know the first thing about it.

08:09.254 --> 08:11.323
- It’s like so...
- Shallow?

08:15.772 --> 08:16.770
Where’s the keg?

08:23.376 --> 08:24.031
You okay?

08:28.358 --> 08:30.892
He used to ask me before he put stuff up.

08:31.725 --> 08:34.059
Now... I don’t even know what he’s interested in.

08:35.184 --> 08:37.655
- Besides basketball.
- Basketball.

08:39.739 --> 08:42.376
Yeah, seems like it changes from day to day.

08:46.754 --> 08:48.295
He talks to you, Dan.

08:49.411 --> 08:50.512
How’s he been doing?

08:52.496 --> 08:55.965
Well, he’s holding up considering Whitey’s moved him out of his position, but

08:56.114 --> 09:00.133
- it’s probably temporary.
- I asked you how he is, not how he’s playing.

09:02.662 --> 09:07.940
It must be confusing for him with Lucas on the team now.

09:10.768 --> 09:12.370
Were we going to talk about that?

09:13.245 --> 09:16.799
- I think that’s probably temporary too.
- You think or you wish?

09:21.601 --> 09:24.683
I saw Karen at the game tonight,

09:25.180 --> 09:29.286
- but then... I’ve never really spoken to her.
- I know this is hard on you, Deb.

09:29.364 --> 09:32.953
No, not really. I think it’s harder for you and Nathan.

09:38.462 --> 09:41.267
So, I know you’re like, having the time of your life,

09:41.313 --> 09:43.689
but can we please make like a tree and get out of here?

09:44.079 --> 09:44.989
We just got here.

09:45.762 --> 09:48.077
Whatever. You let me know when you’ve proved your point.

09:48.102 --> 09:50.488
I’m going to go to one of the eighteen bathrooms in this place.

09:51.339 --> 09:52.573
- Gonna be back in five?
- Yeah.

09:52.665 --> 09:53.345
Alright

09:53.566 --> 09:55.558
- Hey, good game, man.
- Hey, thanks.

10:00.904 --> 10:04.051
Lucas. Come play.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.246
- What’s the game?
- I never...

10:09.222 --> 10:12.202
- And yet apparently you have.
- Shut up, Vegas.

10:12.960 --> 10:17.102
Alright. So the game is, we all take turns saying things that we’ve never done,

10:18.030 --> 10:19.620
and anybody at the table who has...

10:19.722 --> 10:21.127
Bam! Drinks.

10:22.412 --> 10:23.277
Yeah.

10:25.419 --> 10:27.511
Alright, Theresa, you’re up.

10:27.691 --> 10:29.309
Okay. Lets see.

10:30.349 --> 10:35.181
I’ve never... had sex with anything made out of plastic.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.439
Okay, my turn.

10:41.064 --> 10:46.097
I’ve never... no I did that, um...

10:47.045 --> 10:48.765
Alright. My turn.

10:49.477 --> 10:51.923
Oh, lets see. Um...

10:52.339 --> 10:53.548
I’ve never...

10:55.262 --> 10:58.180
I’ve never had a dad who wished I was a stain on the bed sheets.

11:13.812 --> 11:15.439
Then you’re welcome to mine.

11:27.004 --> 11:28.108
Hang on a minute.

11:34.979 --> 11:35.659
Sorry.

11:36.443 --> 11:37.692
How’s the tutoring going?

11:40.319 --> 11:41.661
You’re tutoring Nathan, right?

11:42.996 --> 11:44.610
It’s okay. He tells me everything.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.420
Yeah. You know, he said he needed some help.

11:48.588 --> 11:50.605
Maybe you could teach him to stop being such a jackass.

11:50.819 --> 11:52.464
I will put that on my lesson plan.

11:56.417 --> 11:57.666
Just be careful, okay.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.853
Yeah... sure.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.309
Does Lucas know you’re helping Nathan?

12:07.931 --> 12:08.673
You know...

12:13.004 --> 12:15.257
you say a lot when you keep your mouth shut.

12:15.948 --> 12:16.902
- I’m...
- It's okay.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.743
I keep mine shut too.

12:36.276 --> 12:38.441
- What happened?
- Oh, same old crap.

12:38.518 --> 12:40.956
You know, he thinks that if he keeps hammering me, I’ll quit the team.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.640
Oh. What did he do this time?

12:43.131 --> 12:44.873
He made some feeble comment.

12:47.222 --> 12:50.356
- Not gonna let it get to me.
- Yeah, obviously that’s working out for you.

12:52.527 --> 12:56.197
Luke... have you guys ever actually talked?

12:56.258 --> 12:58.620
Yeah, sure. We trade emails too.

12:58.722 --> 13:02.204
I’m saying you’re so hypersensitive around each other.

13:02.536 --> 13:05.455
And... I get it. I just think that...

13:06.702 --> 13:10.364
maybe everything he says, you take the wrong way, and vice versa.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.430
Okay, there is no misunderstanding what he said.

13:15.332 --> 13:19.213
- And why are you defending him?
- I’m just, I’m trying to bring some perspective.

13:19.290 --> 13:23.421
I mean... It’s a really screwing situation and I’m sure having you around

13:23.493 --> 13:25.623
isn’t any easier for him than it is for you and I think

13:25.680 --> 13:29.161
- maybe if you guys could just talk...
- Tell me that I’m not hearing this.

13:30.926 --> 13:32.407
Then what are you doing here, Lucas?

13:33.779 --> 13:35.822
Obviously, you’re looking for something, right?

13:37.399 --> 13:38.971
I’m not going to let him win.

13:41.894 --> 13:46.457
Fine. Don’t let him win. I’m gonna go home.

13:47.169 --> 13:48.473
- Haley!
- Nope.

13:53.276 --> 13:54.298
Are you leaving?

13:54.965 --> 13:58.545
Nathan... we had a deal. You promised you were gonna be nice.

13:58.734 --> 14:01.668
I am nice. I invited him to this stinking party, didn’t I?

14:02.108 --> 14:04.740
Well, what for? So you could pick on him in public?

14:05.560 --> 14:08.919
- What did you say anyway?
- Oh, man. Is that what...

14:10.146 --> 14:15.405
I made a lame joke. I mean, look, the guys... sometimes we get kind of raw with each other.

14:15.466 --> 14:17.655
I was just trying to include him. He took it the wrong way.

14:17.771 --> 14:19.609
Well, maybe you need to rethink your approach.

14:19.679 --> 14:23.382
- Well, you’re his friend. How do I handle this?
- It’s easy, stop being such a...

14:24.182 --> 14:24.985
jerk.

14:40.815 --> 14:42.113
He really slammed you.

14:42.409 --> 14:44.047
I don’t care what he thinks.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.141
Neither do I.

14:47.749 --> 14:48.546
Oh yeah?

14:50.822 --> 14:51.983
Then why are you drinking?

15:14.992 --> 15:18.075
Nathan! I can’t believe your parents don’t have any decent porn.

15:21.858 --> 15:22.975
Wait.

15:25.472 --> 15:26.538
I’ve got something.

15:34.515 --> 15:35.148
Put that in.

15:35.881 --> 15:36.573
What is it?

15:37.336 --> 15:38.104
It’s a comedy.

15:42.264 --> 15:45.119
So I’m confused. You want to be anonymous...

15:45.722 --> 15:47.745
and you let the world watch you on a web cam.

15:48.124 --> 15:51.944
The world isn’t watching me... but I guess you are.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.508
Okay, the point is...

15:55.625 --> 15:58.498
you want to express yourself but you don’t want people to know it’s you.

15:59.122 --> 16:02.573
I guess I’m just a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a bitch.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.303
Or maybe just a tortured artist.

16:05.169 --> 16:07.657
Look, I don’t need you defending me and my work.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.374
I don’t need you analyzing it or interpreting me either.

16:11.431 --> 16:14.989
And in fact, I’m pretty sure I don’t need you at all.

16:15.507 --> 16:16.519
Pretty sure?

16:17.139 --> 16:21.825
Tree Hill High’s Snowball Court King and Queen, Daniel Scott and Karen Roe.

16:21.912 --> 16:23.985
Karen, what’s the secret to your success?

16:24.220 --> 16:28.593
Um, the secret to our success. Hmm. I don’t know.

16:28.695 --> 16:30.646
Good question. Dan?

16:32.309 --> 16:35.970
- Good sex!
- Be serious.

16:36.181 --> 16:38.587
Karen, do you think you guys will get married?

16:38.691 --> 16:43.006
Do I think Dan and I will get married? Hmm... who knows. I mean...

16:43.498 --> 16:45.034
Oh my god, the hair!

16:46.757 --> 16:52.221
But he really is the sweetest guy in the whole world. So I’m thinking, yes.

16:52.944 --> 16:56.016
Come visit us in 10 years and I bet you can meet the kids

16:56.110 --> 17:00.004
and get a tour of our big house and see how happy we are.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.722
- Who’s the girl?
- Okay ladies and gentleman,

17:03.810 --> 17:07.276
- That’s my mom.
- At least their dreams came true for one of them, right?

17:07.373 --> 17:09.031
Yeah, except for the happy part, right?

17:41.424 --> 17:42.381
I thought you left.

17:43.826 --> 17:47.690
Yeah, I tried to. If the stupid cab would ever get here.

17:48.065 --> 17:49.231
Well, I’m glad you stayed.

17:50.727 --> 17:52.636
I want to thank you for holding back?

17:53.486 --> 17:56.512
- What do you mean?
- Jerk is pretty tame.

17:57.496 --> 17:59.025
You could’ve called me a lot worse.

18:00.290 --> 18:01.447
I probably deserved it.

18:03.839 --> 18:06.917
Look, I’ve been thinking a lot about this tutoring thing.

18:08.503 --> 18:11.320
I’m sorry. I just don’t think it’s a good idea.

18:12.154 --> 18:15.334
- Because of Lucas?
- Well, obviously, yeah.

18:16.158 --> 18:19.225
I don’t know what I was thinking. There’s no good that can possibly come of this.

18:19.588 --> 18:20.299
Really?

18:21.298 --> 18:23.115
I thought I saw you guys fight back there.

18:23.828 --> 18:26.639
Meaning what, that I should keep tutoring you to stick it to him?

18:27.156 --> 18:31.273
Maybe that’s how they do things in Nathan land, but I’m not going to do that to my best friend.

18:33.459 --> 18:35.045
Maybe you’re doing me a favor then.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.231
What does that mean?

18:38.931 --> 18:41.738
Sometimes I think it would be easier if I got kicked off the team.

18:43.479 --> 18:44.938
Especially with my dad.

18:50.605 --> 18:55.363
I should go find Lucas, and just try and smooth things over.

18:55.526 --> 18:57.078
He left a while ago.

18:59.273 --> 19:01.389
Great. Well, I guess I’m walking.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.680
- Let me give you a ride.
- It’s not that far.

19:07.818 --> 19:10.512
Forget it, you’re not going to walk. We’ll take Peyton’s car.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.732
I’m really fine.

19:14.659 --> 19:16.487
You’re a little high on yourself, aren’t you?

19:16.763 --> 19:18.515
Going around telling people you’re all fine.

19:20.395 --> 19:23.790
Look, please, juste take the ride. It’s the least I can do.

19:33.913 --> 19:35.881
Dan. We should talk.

19:41.910 --> 19:46.916
You know, I try to let these things roll off my back. You shut down and walk out mid-conversation.

19:46.988 --> 19:50.147
I swallow it and let it churn around in my stomach until it makes me sick.

19:50.275 --> 19:53.423
What? Because I don’t want to rehash Karen and her son for the ten-thousandth time?

19:53.490 --> 19:55.615
- Frankly, I’m talked out.
- It’s about Nathan.

19:55.757 --> 19:59.916
- What about him?
- He’s just so surly and distant lately

20:00.054 --> 20:02.854
and I fell powerless to do anything about it.

20:03.285 --> 20:07.294
And the way you’re pressuring him since Lucas joined the team seems to make it worse.

20:07.442 --> 20:08.083
Me?

20:09.567 --> 20:12.131
Did you ever stop to think the problem was you?

20:12.321 --> 20:14.344
Maybe if you cared to spend more time at home.

20:14.461 --> 20:17.319
I’m gone ten days out of the month, tops.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.209
And when you are here, you work ‘til all hours.

20:19.299 --> 20:21.911
And you want to know why, Dan? Let me tell you.

20:22.419 --> 20:24.512
Because ever since you started this basketball thing,

20:24.619 --> 20:28.368
I feel like you’ve slowly been stealing him from me.

20:29.126 --> 20:31.214
You’ve made me feel irrelevant.

20:31.456 --> 20:35.197
I go out and I raise money for good causes and I matter out there.

20:35.920 --> 20:39.955
- But at home you shut me out of his life.
- Shut you out?

20:40.184 --> 20:42.985
- Work has always come first with you?
- That is not fair.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.577
You know how hard I’ve tried to balance both.

20:47.056 --> 20:51.479
But, I swear to God, I never would’ve done it if I knew how he’d turn out.

20:51.577 --> 20:54.631
- He’s a good kid.
- Based on what? His scoring average?

20:58.760 --> 21:02.365
Deb, I just want what’s best for our son, what makes him happy.

21:02.472 --> 21:04.290
Well, then, something’s not working, Dan.

21:04.731 --> 21:08.892
Because that kid I saw tonight is anything but happy.

21:23.024 --> 21:25.353
Don’t let me have another beer unless I beg you.

21:25.876 --> 21:27.222
The same goes for boys.

21:28.666 --> 21:31.926
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering if we’re all going to end up like Karen.

21:33.507 --> 21:37.176
- Who is Karen?
- That’s Lucas’ mom

21:39.251 --> 21:41.583
Not without proper birth control we won’t.

21:42.556 --> 21:43.668
That’s not what I meant.

21:45.378 --> 21:47.683
She was our age when that tape was made, Brooke.

21:48.926 --> 21:50.692
We’re just like her.

21:52.705 --> 21:55.925
Don’t you think it was awful how she just let Nathan’s dad treat her like crap?

21:56.027 --> 21:59.551
Yeah. But honey, that doesn’t mean we’re like her.

22:00.867 --> 22:03.770
Maybe it mean’s you’re like her.

22:19.949 --> 22:24.107
Yeah, this is my house. We’re staying here while we renovate the mansion

22:25.104 --> 22:28.023
- It’s not like I was trying to show off.
- Isn’t that your default setting.

22:29.275 --> 22:29.867
Sorry.

22:33.077 --> 22:34.167
Can I be honest with you?

22:35.974 --> 22:38.294
Yeah. I don’t know. You tell me.

22:40.410 --> 22:43.481
What I said at the beach... that was a lie.

22:47.418 --> 22:49.231
I’m really lucky to have basketball.

22:50.586 --> 22:53.035
It’s pretty much my shell to everything from here on out.

22:54.182 --> 22:56.758
If I lose it, it’s over for me.

22:58.125 --> 23:01.586
- So, don’t lose it.
- Well, that’s just the thing.

23:02.681 --> 23:07.868
With my grades, I’m close to being ineligible to do the one thing that I’m actually good at.

23:09.246 --> 23:11.744
It’s not just my life, either. It’s my dad’s, too.

23:13.132 --> 23:15.210
It’s like he’s still got something to prove to Whitey.

23:17.339 --> 23:20.110
And if I screw it up, it’s gonna destroy him.

23:23.407 --> 23:24.846
And it will destroy me.

23:27.207 --> 23:29.920
Look, I know you have no reason to do this,

23:30.075 --> 23:32.777
and I know it’s just going to complicate things with Lucas, but...

23:34.093 --> 23:35.691
I really need your help.

23:36.305 --> 23:38.988
And I will find you someone else. I promise.

23:39.131 --> 23:39.853
No.

23:41.644 --> 23:44.246
I came to you because you’re the best tutor at the school.

23:45.572 --> 23:47.195
And you’re not going to tear me down.

23:48.809 --> 23:51.789
It’s not exactly easy having everybody know you’re failing.

23:56.027 --> 23:57.506
It’s you or nobody else.

24:00.979 --> 24:01.726
I...

24:06.891 --> 24:08.233
Okay. I will...

24:10.763 --> 24:12.432
I will get you through the semester.

24:13.947 --> 24:16.681
And then you’ve got to be on your own. I’m serious.

24:17.193 --> 24:19.426
- That’s totally fine with me.
- Okay...

24:21.505 --> 24:22.908
Great, so we’ll start on Monday.

24:24.562 --> 24:25.846
Lay off Lucas.

25:22.392 --> 25:24.833
Peyton! You okay?

25:27.149 --> 25:30.221
Yeah, she’s fine. Can’t say the same for her car though.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.538
And what the hell were you doing following my girlfriend?

25:37.675 --> 25:38.321
I wasn’t.

25:39.314 --> 25:41.368
Look, I thought she was driving and she was drinking.

25:42.617 --> 25:43.727
Hey, where are you going?

25:45.341 --> 25:46.651
Back to the party, dumbass.

25:46.780 --> 25:48.058
What, are you gonna leave her car like this?

25:48.315 --> 25:50.751
Yeah, and if you stand there you can watch me.

25:51.556 --> 25:53.660
- You know this is a crime.
- So call the cops.

25:54.438 --> 25:56.810
Nathan, you can’t walk away from this.

25:57.593 --> 26:00.019
- I saw you do it.
- No you didn’t see me do it.

26:00.235 --> 26:01.848
Because I was with Tim the whole time.

26:02.308 --> 26:05.723
Which is exactly what he’s going to say if anybody asks him. He owes me.

26:07.627 --> 26:10.039
So it looks like its your word against ours now.

26:10.935 --> 26:12.425
You can guess how that’s going to go down.

26:12.532 --> 26:14.165
So you’re just going to lie and walk away.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.512
What about Peyton?

26:17.668 --> 26:18.795
You know, your girlfriend?

26:20.248 --> 26:22.906
- The car’s registered in her name.
- Yeah, and you know what?

26:22.983 --> 26:27.120
Come to think of it, like you said, she was really drunk last time I saw her.

26:27.915 --> 26:29.152
Maybe she did this.

26:31.543 --> 26:36.193
But then again, all I see is a wrecked car... and you.

26:51.578 --> 26:53.262
Hit and run, huh? That’s beautiful.

26:54.030 --> 26:55.515
I could lose my license for this.

26:55.966 --> 26:57.856
I didn’t know what else do. He just walked away.

26:59.735 --> 27:02.581
You wanna tell me what it is with you and this girl? Huh?

27:03.140 --> 27:06.185
That you’re willing to break the law for her? Nobody is worth that.

27:06.289 --> 27:08.700
I couldn’t let Nathan get away with it the way he does everything else.

27:08.787 --> 27:12.001
And I sure as hell could let him do that to her.

27:13.901 --> 27:17.552
Okay. What about the guys car you hit? Huh?

27:17.960 --> 27:19.200
He just gets screwed over?

27:19.794 --> 27:22.938
I left him a note. I said I did it. Bring his car here.

27:23.410 --> 27:27.627
Oh, well, that’s just great. Lucas, you know I’m already struggling to bring in paying customers.

27:27.721 --> 27:31.520
Look, I’ll do the work myself, alright? After hours. And I’ll pay for the materials.

27:31.949 --> 27:33.312
Oh, you’re damn right you will.

27:34.479 --> 27:36.348
Your mom’s going to love this.

27:36.932 --> 27:39.997
No. She’s got enough to deal with. You don’t have to tell her.

27:40.182 --> 27:43.100
Oh, I’m not going to. You are. And if you don’t, then I will.

27:43.894 --> 27:45.835
Because you’re going to take something away from this.

27:48.205 --> 27:50.187
Cover the car. I’ll give you a ride home.

28:14.322 --> 28:17.661
I want to have a pipe replaced. I don’t want to send your kids to college.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.036
Fine. I’ll do it myself.

28:36.324 --> 28:37.752
I’m sorry. We’re just closing.

28:41.976 --> 28:44.471
I was hoping to get a coffee.

28:45.689 --> 28:46.323
To go.

29:01.950 --> 29:02.753
Anything else?

29:05.196 --> 29:06.164
A biscotti.

29:20.413 --> 29:21.483
$3.20.

29:32.506 --> 29:33.340
Hey.

29:34.749 --> 29:40.279
You tell Dan that if he wants to spy on me or threaten me or whatever the hell this is,

29:40.433 --> 29:43.314
- he can come down and do it himself.
- Dan didn’t send me.

29:43.831 --> 29:46.279
- I came on my own.
- So it’s a coincidence.

29:46.418 --> 29:53.134
No. I wanted you to know... everything that happened between you and Dan,

29:53.355 --> 29:56.514
I don’t carry that weight around and I don’t care to.

29:58.138 --> 30:03.231
Frankly, it looks to me like you’ve done a wonderful job raising Lucas.

30:03.811 --> 30:08.674
I’ve seen the two of you together, and quite honestly, it makes me a bit jealous.

30:09.524 --> 30:14.460
Look. Our two families... it’s really awkward.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.805
I’m not deluded enough to believe otherwise.

30:16.892 --> 30:20.118
I know how it is with you and Dan and our two boys.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.238
There’s a lot of history there.

30:23.676 --> 30:26.626
But it doesn’t have to be our history.

30:47.269 --> 30:49.041
You reinvented cruel tonight.

30:49.173 --> 30:50.330
It was a joke!

30:50.909 --> 30:52.702
Funny how you’re the only one laughing.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.745
Like you and your stupid comic strip.

31:00.064 --> 31:02.716
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.

31:03.060 --> 31:05.651
I’m sorry is getting a little old with you, Nathan.

31:06.956 --> 31:07.759
I know.

31:09.690 --> 31:11.768
I just can’t remember a time when thing’s were this bad.

31:13.131 --> 31:15.517
Where have you been for the past two hours.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.167
- I went on a beer run.
- To where? Canada?

31:19.632 --> 31:24.026
Nathan, I wanted to go home. But I can’t because it seems my car’s missing.

31:24.145 --> 31:25.777
You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?

31:26.217 --> 31:28.717
- Uh... I think Tim took it.
- You think?

31:28.900 --> 31:32.423
Well, he wanted to take Brooke home, so I told him he could borrow it.

31:34.262 --> 31:35.295
I didn’t think you’d care.

31:38.419 --> 31:42.167
I never told a ridiculous lie to my girlfriend’s face.

31:44.527 --> 31:45.488
Drink up.

31:46.586 --> 31:50.405
Because Brooke got a ride home with Theresa after you disappeared. Wanna play again?

31:50.537 --> 31:52.836
Alright, so then it was some other girl. I don’t know.

31:53.685 --> 31:55.859
What’s the big deal anyway? I knew you were going to stay here.

31:55.986 --> 31:57.609
So you gave away my car?

31:58.495 --> 31:59.917
Look, whatever.

32:01.182 --> 32:02.647
I’m going to bed. Are you coming?

32:02.918 --> 32:04.859
Yeah. That’s what I’m gonna do.

32:06.630 --> 32:09.410
I cannot believe you just asked me that with a straight face.

32:17.065 --> 32:19.236
You will not believe the night I had tonight.

32:22.176 --> 32:23.162
Yeah, me too.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.579
What’s going on?

32:29.000 --> 32:32.849
Well, turns out fixing the water mane is not a big deal.

32:32.948 --> 32:35.528
I just have to pick up a pipe at the hardware store in the morning.

32:35.641 --> 32:39.661
And then if you help me dig out where the break is I think we can fix this ourselves.

32:39.859 --> 32:41.236
So now I’m digging ditches?

32:46.976 --> 32:51.875
You mind telling me what happened before you destroy what’s left of my table?

32:54.862 --> 32:56.913
Did you know you could fit this whole house

32:57.238 --> 33:00.247
into the living room of their place at the beach?

33:00.452 --> 33:03.725
- No. Why would you even go there?
- Because I love getting dumped on.

33:03.913 --> 33:06.601
Well, you don’t have to put up with that. You could just walk away.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.536
- Like you.
- Excuse me?

33:08.783 --> 33:12.117
You know, you never told me that you had this whole thing mapped out with Dan.

33:12.801 --> 33:15.940
That you even ever talked about marriage before you were pregnant with me.

33:18.331 --> 33:21.763
All you ever said was that he found out and took off.

33:21.869 --> 33:26.083
- Wait. Where did you hear this?
- Those guys... Nathan, Nathan and his ass of a father.

33:26.145 --> 33:29.590
They do whatever they want. And they screw everybody else in the process.

33:29.677 --> 33:32.243
And yet you and I... we stand by and we let them?

33:34.782 --> 33:39.082
You should’ve made him give us what we were entitled to so that we didn’t have to live like this.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.964
You should’ve made him pay.

33:44.508 --> 33:48.226
Luke... what happened tonight?

33:48.376 --> 33:49.779
I learned something, that’s all.

33:52.309 --> 33:53.675
Everybody has secrets.

33:54.535 --> 33:55.426
Right Mom?

34:05.086 --> 34:05.947
Nathan!

34:16.811 --> 34:18.860
- Hey, what’s up?
- Did you bring my car back?

34:19.360 --> 34:22.536
- Your car? I don’t have your car.
- Nathan said you took my car.

34:24.897 --> 34:28.101
- Oh, your car. We...
- Nice try.

34:28.786 --> 34:30.132
Where the hell is my car?

34:50.563 --> 34:52.056
You calm enough to talk?

34:54.607 --> 34:56.225
Sorry I went off.

34:57.167 --> 34:59.143
I was pissed and you were in the line of fire.

35:01.913 --> 35:04.744
- It’s usually when the truth comes out.
- Yeah, well, the truth is,

35:04.806 --> 35:09.470
I’m the reason you never got what you wanted. So that kind of nullifies my right to complain.

35:11.264 --> 35:12.814
Is that what you think?

35:15.087 --> 35:17.386
I got exactly what I want, Lucas.

35:18.482 --> 35:22.081
Everybody seems to think that I’m some kind of victim. I chose this.

35:22.317 --> 35:25.215
And if I had to do it over, you and I would still be having this conversation.

35:25.260 --> 35:26.531
Yeah, I know, I just...

35:27.159 --> 35:31.251
I hate to see them get away with it, Dan and Nathan, you know. They should’ve helped you out.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.349
It’s not fair.

35:36.976 --> 35:42.075
I’m glad he never offered. Because at the time, I honestly don’t know what I would’ve said.

35:43.125 --> 35:46.136
But I can tell you this much, Lucas. If he had given us money,

35:46.576 --> 35:49.294
he’d have felt entitled to have a say in how you were being raised

35:49.345 --> 35:52.401
and I think that that would’ve been a bigger price to pay.

35:54.149 --> 35:56.037
You’ve seen how Nathan’s turned out.

35:57.071 --> 35:58.751
Like father, like son.

35:59.448 --> 36:01.593
So who do you think we should feel sorry for?

36:01.967 --> 36:03.339
Ourselves or them?

36:13.401 --> 36:13.922
Hey.

36:16.334 --> 36:17.405
Still not home.

36:18.473 --> 36:19.523
Oh he will be.

36:20.373 --> 36:24.065
So I take it this isn’t the first time you’ve let him stay out all night?

36:24.955 --> 36:28.146
Oh, I don’t want to smother him, Deb. He’s a responsible, disciplined kid.

36:28.345 --> 36:30.583
Is he? Hmm.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.820
Your brother just called.

36:33.235 --> 36:37.827
Our responsible, disciplined kid got into a hit and run last night.

36:38.074 --> 36:39.901
- In Peyton’s car.
- Is he okay?

36:39.983 --> 36:43.726
Oh, he’s not hurt. But do you want to know what he did afterwards?

36:45.707 --> 36:48.441
He walked away and tried to dump it on Lucas.

36:52.984 --> 36:55.492
- Well, I’ll talk to him.
- You’ll talk to him.

36:58.421 --> 37:01.319
- Is that all you have to say?
- What do you want me to say?

37:02.530 --> 37:04.442
I don’t know anymore.

37:05.542 --> 37:06.930
But I’ll tell you one thing.

37:07.478 --> 37:11.829
Seems to me you and Nathan have gotten a little too comfortable when I’m not around.

37:12.363 --> 37:17.314
So I’m cutting back at the foundation. Fewer hours and no more travel.

37:19.976 --> 37:23.939
- Try not to look so disappointed.
- Come on, Deb, you don’t have to do this.

37:24.021 --> 37:26.176
I don’t have to? Or you don’t want me to?

37:32.933 --> 37:33.702
What?

37:39.601 --> 37:40.789
Hey, you’re still alive.

37:41.491 --> 37:44.055
Guess you didn’t tell your mom about your little crime spree yet, huh?

37:44.199 --> 37:44.906
This morning.

37:45.642 --> 37:47.173
She’s working on my punishment now.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.083
Good. You recognize that car over there?

37:50.644 --> 37:51.946
The owner got your note.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.387
I talked him out of pressing charges.

37:55.038 --> 37:55.945
Thanks, Keith.

37:56.769 --> 37:59.754
Lets just get this done, okay? So we can get back to billing for the work we do.

38:03.599 --> 38:04.736
What do you want?

38:07.823 --> 38:10.045
I suspect his parents sent him.

38:11.130 --> 38:12.677
- You told them?
- Yeah.

38:12.759 --> 38:14.836
You may be willing to let him get away with it but I’m not.

38:15.763 --> 38:17.304
Try not to kill each other, girls.

38:23.346 --> 38:25.364
Peyton wants to know when she’s going to get her car back.

38:25.430 --> 38:26.450
When it’s fixed.

38:27.177 --> 38:30.597
- How much is the work going to cost?
- I don’t know. A lot. Why?

38:32.915 --> 38:36.029
Give me the invoice when it’s done. My dad will right a check.

38:36.096 --> 38:36.864
No thanks.

38:38.307 --> 38:40.893
- I said we’ll pay you.
- You want to pay me?

38:41.430 --> 38:42.792
You stay away from me.

38:45.470 --> 38:47.748
- Suit yourself.
- Hey, whatever you’re up to...

38:51.087 --> 38:53.862
- Stay the hell away from Haley.
- We’re just talking man.

38:54.599 --> 38:56.099
You know, kind of like you and Peyton.

39:10.589 --> 39:11.838
Car will be ready by Friday.

39:12.622 --> 39:13.329
Whatever.

39:14.358 --> 39:16.037
The bag of stuff by the door is yours.

39:17.194 --> 39:18.863
What’s all this?

39:18.991 --> 39:21.305
It’s all the crap you’ve left here. Take it.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.600
- This is the necklace I gave you.
- You mean the leash?

39:24.582 --> 39:25.340
No thanks.

39:26.711 --> 39:27.614
Peyton, come on.

39:29.281 --> 39:33.517
Look, my mom’s gong to cool down and everything will be back to normal.

39:33.603 --> 39:36.773
Okay, trust me, the last thing I want with us is normal.

39:36.856 --> 39:39.517
In case you haven’t noticed, normal sucks with us, Nathan.

39:39.605 --> 39:42.005
Peyton, is this about your car? Because I’m taking care of that.

39:42.082 --> 39:43.946
It’s not about the car. It’s about you.

39:44.679 --> 39:47.213
I finally saw you clearly for the first time last night.

39:47.290 --> 39:50.439
The way you treated me, the way you treated Tim, the way you treated your brother.

39:50.536 --> 39:53.183
- Don’t call him that.
- And the way you’re playing that girl.

39:53.281 --> 39:56.588
What? Are you talking about Haley? Is that what this is about?

39:56.833 --> 39:58.246
Peyton, she means nothing.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.485
Okay, if that’s the case, then you’re an ass.

40:00.673 --> 40:02.922
And even if she does mean something, you’re still an ass

40:03.003 --> 40:06.188
and what’s really sad, Nathan, is that you’re too stupid to get that.

40:06.737 --> 40:11.574
So thank you for being such an amazing son of a bitch last night. You really made this a no-brainer.

40:12.728 --> 40:15.676
- I’ll call you when you’re not so PMS.
- Don’t bother.

40:17.095 --> 40:20.612
I mean it. We’re done. So get the hell out.

40:21.712 --> 40:23.653
I mean it! Get the hell out!

41:42.077 --> 41:44.478
Hey, I was beginning to think I would never see you again.

41:45.309 --> 41:46.408
You’re avoiding me, right?

41:46.886 --> 41:47.663
A little.

41:48.866 --> 41:52.675
Luke, I was just trying to help. You just like, jumped down my throat.

41:55.938 --> 41:58.395
We’ve always been able to talk about stuff, you know.

42:00.458 --> 42:02.378
I just had this crazy idea that if...

42:03.376 --> 42:05.343
you could see things from Nathan’s side...

42:07.817 --> 42:10.073
You’re just a real pain in the butt sometimes.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.984
Yeah. At least we can still be honest with each other.

42:15.098 --> 42:16.289
Yeah. At least.

42:17.257 --> 42:19.255
So, if anything were going on with you...

42:19.961 --> 42:23.212
anything important or weird, or confusing...

42:24.379 --> 42:28.147
I mean, you could still be honest with me about that, right?

42:28.255 --> 42:29.419
Yeah, of course.

42:39.044 --> 42:40.793
You left that in Peyton’s car.
