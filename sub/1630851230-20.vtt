I mean, that'll get
him sent away for life.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.120
- Right. That can't be him.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.818
- Who was
the Organized Crime Agent

09:17.861 --> 09:19.384
on Jackie's case?

09:19.428 --> 09:20.951
[keyboard clacking]

09:20.995 --> 09:23.867
- Terry Daniels. He's retired.
He lives in Dyker Heights.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.869
- This the podcast?

09:25.913 --> 09:27.131
- Yeah.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.263
You want me
to help you download it?

09:28.306 --> 09:30.091
- Please.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.354
So what do I do next?

09:32.397 --> 09:34.095
Press this little button here?

09:36.750 --> 09:38.708
I'm not a grandfather.
- [softly chuckles]

09:38.752 --> 09:40.710
- Okay, you guys start
listening to the episodes,

09:40.754 --> 09:42.103
see what you can find.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.671
Kristin,
let's go see Terry Daniels.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.240
- Jimmy Russo wasn't born
yesterday, ya know?

09:49.284 --> 09:51.155
He knew
they was comin' for him.

09:51.199 --> 09:52.374
That's when he called me in.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.941
'Cause he knew
I was loyal to him.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.812
Every weekday,
come rain or shine,

09:55.856 --> 09:57.945
Massucci was at
that ice cream drive-thru.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.121
Some of the fellas even
called him Sprinkles, right?

10:00.164 --> 10:01.426
Behind his back.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.733
So I put a couple
of guys on the inside

10:03.777 --> 10:05.909
and they got me
at that drive-thru window.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.868
The look on that
chauffeur's face--

10:07.911 --> 10:10.000
Oh,marone, it was priceless.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.089
Like fish in a barrel.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.961
None of them saw it coming.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.354
- That's from a few weeks back.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.879
- What do you think?
Is it Jackie?

10:18.922 --> 10:21.882
- Older, for sure,
but that's him.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.059
- You're certain?

10:25.102 --> 10:27.888
- I listened to a thousand
hours of that voice on wiretap.

10:27.931 --> 10:30.891
I know it when I hear it.
- We need your help.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.458
Jackie's somehow
wrapped up in our case.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.940
- Yeah, well...

10:36.984 --> 10:40.857
much as I'd like to get
back in the game, I'm retired.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.946
And my wife would kill me.

10:42.990 --> 10:47.298
- We need what you know--
the details at your fingertips.

10:47.342 --> 10:50.171
We can't get that from
a file or a search engine.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.868
We need you.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.392
[phone rings]

10:54.436 --> 10:56.960
Excuse me.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.658
Hey.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.923
[sighs]

11:02.966 --> 11:06.143
Thanks, Ortiz.
We'll meet you there.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.408
Triple slaying in
a cemetery in East Flatbush.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.410
The shooter
used an assault rifle

11:12.454 --> 11:13.934
and fled in a green Toyota.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.370
It's our UnSub.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.417
You comin'?

11:19.461 --> 11:21.332
[police radio chatter]

11:22.899 --> 11:25.119
- Three people shot.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
That's the widow.

11:26.903 --> 11:30.428
Mr. Tillis.
Worked for the funeral home.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.343
And the brother
of the deceased.

11:32.387 --> 11:35.346
- What about witnesses?
- Nothing useful.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.348
They all say
it happened so fast.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.959
- What're you thinking?

11:39.002 --> 11:42.310
- Jackie took out a capo
here in 1985.

11:42.353 --> 11:43.877
Freddie Bertolucci.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.530
Guy was
at his mother's funeral.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.751
Jackie shot him,
fell into an open grave.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.274
He was making
a statement with that.

11:50.318 --> 11:51.885
- The St. Joseph's Hit.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.017
Jackie talked about it
on his podcast.

11:54.061 --> 11:57.455
- He only shot one guy.
- Our guy shot three.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.414
Maybe he was
trying to get one of them

11:59.457 --> 12:01.329
to fall into
the grave like the capo.

12:01.372 --> 12:04.201
- He's listening
to the podcast.

12:04.245 --> 12:07.378
- And recreating
Jackie's famous hits

12:07.422 --> 12:10.207
using civilians as targets.

12:15.691 --> 12:16.692
- We've got an UnSub

12:16.736 --> 12:17.954
who's recreating
famous mob hits.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.739
Why would someone
want to do that?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.349
- Fascination with the mafia.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.960
- Glorifies brutality,
promises camaraderie.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.702
- Yeah, but mob violence
is about business.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.705
Civilians are never targeted.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.707
- Maybe these hits are
as close as he can get to it.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.274
- Which would
make him a copycat.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.363
- Copycats are motivated
by one or two things:

12:35.406 --> 12:36.843
either they have a deep desire

12:36.886 --> 12:38.627
to belong to something
bigger than themselves,

12:38.670 --> 12:40.455
or they're trying to
pass off their kills

12:40.498 --> 12:42.544
as the work of someone else.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.459
- Well, we can rule out
the second reason.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.330
- Copying
a dead hitman's murders

12:46.374 --> 12:48.028
without cover's
pretty reckless.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.899
He must really
want to be in the Mob.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.466
- It's kinda weird, though,
isn't it?

12:51.509 --> 12:53.033
The mafia's
not what it used to be.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.339
- Extortion,
loan sharking, prostitution--

12:55.383 --> 12:56.384
these things
are perennial rackets.

12:56.427 --> 12:57.733
These guys are still out there.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.866
Still doing their thing,
just with crappier cars.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.564
- Okay, what if our UnSub
is using these recreations

13:02.607 --> 13:04.871
as some kind of
calling card to get noticed?

13:04.914 --> 13:08.613
- If this guy's that desperate
to hook up with a crime family,

13:08.657 --> 13:11.007
somebody on the streets
gonna know who he is.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.270
- You still got contacts?

13:13.314 --> 13:14.706
- There might be a guy.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.753
Lucca Patino, Jr.
His dad was a CI.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.973
I hear he's taking over
for him after he passed.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.409
- Let's pay him a visit.

13:21.452 --> 13:22.714
We still gotta find
this Jackie.

13:22.758 --> 13:23.933
And his family.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.892
He had a wife, didn't he?
- Yeah.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.415
Dolce.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.895
I hear she's still alive.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.287
- Hana, see if
you can find her.

13:30.331 --> 13:31.985
She might be able
to lead us to him.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.857
Kristin and Ortiz, the platform
that hosts Jackie's podcast--

13:34.901 --> 13:36.554
they must know
where he broadcasts from.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.948
See what they can give us.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.997
- Do you know where
Jackie records his podcast?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.913
- I can't answer that.
We don't know ourselves.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.740
- Well, it's supposedly
in a country

13:48.784 --> 13:50.438
with no extradition treaty
with the U.S.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.832
So...Asia? The Caribbean?
- I don't know.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.050
- Is it Jackie
that does the podcast

13:54.094 --> 13:55.704
or is it someone else?

13:55.747 --> 13:58.098
- I can't answer that either.
- Counselor, you do understand

13:58.141 --> 13:59.839
that we're searching
for a fugitive

13:59.882 --> 14:01.318
who's killed six people.
- I do.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.842
- And that your company's
podcast

14:02.885 --> 14:04.321
could possibly
be motivating him.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.757
You're telling us
you have server logs,

14:05.801 --> 14:07.759
no IP address that shows
Jackie's location?

14:07.803 --> 14:09.109
- What I'm telling you

14:09.152 --> 14:10.893
is that the information
you're seeking

14:10.937 --> 14:12.068
is both private
and proprietary.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.722
It's protected by federal law

14:13.765 --> 14:15.506
and the contract
we have with our client

14:15.550 --> 14:17.900
which prohibits any voluntary
disclosure to third parties.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.860
- Yeah, but we're not
a third party, we're the FBI.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.296
- I understand.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.602
And company policy is
to comply with any requests

14:24.646 --> 14:26.909
from law enforcement as long
as there is a court order.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.911
- You're asking
for a search warrant.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.391
- A court order.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.914
Signed by a federal magistrate
after judicial review

14:31.958 --> 14:33.785
establishing probable cause.

14:33.829 --> 14:36.919
You bring me that,
and I'm happy to help.

14:42.055 --> 14:46.407
- There he is.
- Terry, good to see you.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.975
- Yeah. Didn't think
you'd recognize me.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.151
This is Agent Scott.

14:51.194 --> 14:54.067
Sorry to hear about your dad.
- Thanks.

14:54.110 --> 14:57.157
I thought you retired.
- Yeah, so did I.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.986
So, solar panels, huh?
That's the new racket?

15:00.029 --> 15:01.683
- Just trying to be good
stewards of the environment.

15:01.726 --> 15:02.945
- Renewable energy.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.078
I'm a big fan.
[softly chuckles]

15:05.121 --> 15:07.689
- So, uh, what's going on?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.038
- We're looking for
someone who's trying

15:09.082 --> 15:11.998
too hard to get made.
White male, early 20s.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.391
- He the one offing women and
children out in Long Island?

15:14.435 --> 15:16.132
- Possibly. We think
he might be replicating

15:16.176 --> 15:17.655
Jackie The Fox's hits.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.396
- Trying to get noticed.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.007
- Well, if that little punk

15:21.050 --> 15:22.704
thinks he's impressing anybody,
he's nuts.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.010
- You know him?

15:24.053 --> 15:25.881
- No,
I've only heard about him.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.058
- Got a name?
- No.

15:29.102 --> 15:31.887
But, uh, there's a guy

15:31.931 --> 15:33.976
[phone rings]
out in Sheepshead Bay.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.848
Me might be able to help you.
Named Louie.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.894
- Kristin, what's up?

15:38.938 --> 15:42.158
No, I don't think a warrant
will be a problem at all.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.117
I got probable cause
standing right here.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.901
- Tell 'em I sent you.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.903
- No, I'll handle it...

15:47.947 --> 15:49.905
Yeah, go talk to a Louie M.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.777
in Sheepshead Bay
who might know our UnSub.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.997
I'll text you his number.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.130
Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.784
- Jackie "The Fox" Bianchi?

15:59.828 --> 16:01.525
Thought he was dead.
- We did too.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.006
But apparently he's hosting
a podcast somewhere

16:04.050 --> 16:05.660
and we need to find him.

16:05.703 --> 16:08.619
To do that, we need access
to the server logs

16:08.663 --> 16:10.578
of the company
that distributes it.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.929
- Well,
what probable cause do you have

16:13.973 --> 16:15.626
to believe
that it's really Jackie?

16:15.670 --> 16:18.064
- Oh, it's all there
in the application.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.066
Agent Daniels worked his cases

16:20.109 --> 16:22.068
when he was
with Organized Crime.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.026
He listened to the podcast

16:24.070 --> 16:26.028
and he says
it's Jackie's voice.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.857
He's right outside
if you wanna talk to him.

16:28.900 --> 16:32.252
- What crimes is Mr. Bianchi
alleged to have committed?

16:32.295 --> 16:38.040
- Well, um, he was wanted
for 14 murders back in the day.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.694
- Wanted, yes, yes.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.043
But never arrested
or convicted.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.089
I'm talking about crimes
in association

16:43.132 --> 16:44.960
with...this application.

16:46.570 --> 16:49.834
It's not illegal
to do a podcast, is it?

16:49.878 --> 16:51.880
- Come on, Your Honor.

16:51.923 --> 16:54.839
Help a guy out.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.713
- "Help a guy out."

16:58.756 --> 17:01.020
- What do you say?
- [chuckles]

17:01.063 --> 17:06.155
Do you really think
that you can waltz in here

17:06.199 --> 17:07.548
flashing your baby blues

17:07.591 --> 17:10.594
and expect me to sign
a warrant based on

17:10.638 --> 17:12.988
a retired field agent's
30-year-old recollection

17:13.032 --> 17:15.077
of a younger man's voice?

17:15.121 --> 17:17.993
A man, incidentally,
that the FBI itself says

17:18.037 --> 17:20.126
has been dead since 1992?

17:20.169 --> 17:23.955
- [clears throat]
- That's not probable cause.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.609
That's a joke.

17:25.653 --> 17:29.178
- I know, but, Your Honor--
- We're done here, Agent...

17:29.222 --> 17:31.137
- Scott.
- Scott. Agent Scott, yeah.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.052
You don't have
sufficient probable cause,

17:33.095 --> 17:36.620
and your application's denied.

17:36.664 --> 17:39.580
So you can let yourself out.

17:39.623 --> 17:40.624
- Is that a no?

17:40.668 --> 17:42.844
- That's a no. But good luck.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.110
- Lucca Patino said
you were a friend of his

17:48.154 --> 17:49.851
and you might be
able to help us out.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.983
- Yeah, okay.
Anything for Lucca.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.160
- You know him?

17:54.203 --> 17:56.640
- Yeah, I know this guy.

17:56.684 --> 17:59.121
I fired him today.
- Why is that?

17:59.165 --> 18:00.340
- He kept
shooting his mouth off.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.342
About how he's a paisan.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.865
How he wants "in."

18:03.908 --> 18:05.867
No discipline. No discretion.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.347
He ain't right for us.

Nah.

Georgie.

Thanks again.
