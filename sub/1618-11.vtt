To save my city.

But to do so, I can't be

In exchange, I'll promise you and

- He's visiting a sick relative.

- You're right, that's very suspicious.
- He didn't go there to visit her.

He went there to kill her, to cover up the
fact that as a child, he killed his father.

- From inside a padded room.
