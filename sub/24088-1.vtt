02:14.834 --> 02:17.012
- I'm not a gold digger.

02:17.036 --> 02:19.772
I just want what every
other woman wants.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.419
If a girl out there says
she doesn't want security

02:23.443 --> 02:26.613
and to be pampered by a man,
she is a flat out liar.

02:28.648 --> 02:32.528
The only difference is, I
have the balls to say it.

02:32.552 --> 02:35.898
- Fine, I love you but
you're fucking up your life.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.433
- I didn't hear you.

02:37.457 --> 02:41.804
- I love you but you're
fucking up your life!

02:56.809 --> 02:59.722
- How come Gina's kept you
a secret for this long?

02:59.746 --> 03:02.958
- Ah, I don't know, I've
heard a lot about you, Nick.

03:02.982 --> 03:04.393
- Oh really, like what?

03:04.417 --> 03:06.653
- All good things.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.131
- I like you, you're
a lot of fun.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.801
- Well you know, a woman of
my caliber is hard to find.

03:12.825 --> 03:17.006
- Oh really? Wow, so should I
consider myself a lucky guy?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.808
- Eh, not lucky yet,

03:19.832 --> 03:22.444
but depends on how
you play your cards.

03:22.468 --> 03:25.381
- Mm, I like that challenge.

03:36.215 --> 03:37.383
- Taxi!

03:52.398 --> 03:53.742
- Oh come on, bust out already.

03:53.766 --> 03:56.336
- You'll get your
turn, handsome.

03:58.338 --> 03:59.615
- Whew!
- Ew!

03:59.639 --> 04:02.384
- Hey cab driver,
will you pull over?

04:02.408 --> 04:05.087
I think we're gonna get out
and walk the rest of the way.

04:05.111 --> 04:06.479
- Oh really?

04:07.814 --> 04:09.091
- We'll call you later.

04:09.115 --> 04:11.660
- Yeah, thank me tomorrow.

04:11.684 --> 04:13.862
- Someone's gonna have fun!

04:44.050 --> 04:46.495
- Architect, I like that.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.797
Creative men definitely
keep me on my toes.

04:48.821 --> 04:51.133
- Well, I guess I'm
into beautiful things.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.859
- I guess you are.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.140
- So, real estate, right?

04:58.164 --> 04:59.341
- Oh yeah.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.410
But that's just a
part time thing.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.947
You know how in LA, every actor
is a waiter on the side?

05:04.971 --> 05:08.584
Well, in Miami, every artist
is a realtor on the side.

05:08.608 --> 05:11.920
- So what's your passion?

05:11.944 --> 05:13.789
- My passion is dancing.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.591
- Well that's
exciting, that's fun.

05:15.615 --> 05:19.094
- Yeah, I've been doing it for
a little while, and ya know,

05:19.118 --> 05:20.787
it's what I do.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.600
- Listen, I just wanna say...
- You OK?

05:24.624 --> 05:25.701
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no no no.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.527
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

05:28.428 --> 05:31.106
- What is it about you?

05:31.130 --> 05:32.598
- What do you mean?

05:34.567 --> 05:36.111
- I've only known you one night,

05:36.135 --> 05:38.938
but there's somethin' different.

06:20.580 --> 06:23.992
- Yes, I did the breathing.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.928
I always do the breathing.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.629
Sandra, you've really gotta
stop with this yin yang stuff

06:27.653 --> 06:29.965
because either you can
dance or you can't.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.600
And I clearly suck.

06:31.624 --> 06:32.968
- No, you don't.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.771
- This is the fifth audition
I've been on this year,

06:35.795 --> 06:38.774
and I haven't been cast
in a single video.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.909
- Look, I've seen you dance.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.545
That casting director
was an idiot.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.381
There'll be a lot
of other auditions,

06:45.405 --> 06:46.405
you'll nail the next one.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.752
- Yeah, and that's what you
said on my last one, bitch.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.320
- Very angry.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.289
But this one, I can feel
the planets aligning

06:54.313 --> 06:56.125
to make it happen.
- And I can feel my thumb

06:56.149 --> 06:57.359
hanging up on you.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.294
I'll see ya when I get home.

06:59.318 --> 07:00.853
Love you too.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.874
Oh!

07:18.805 --> 07:19.806
Oh that's...

07:20.339 --> 07:22.041
I gotta take this.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.887
- It's all good.

07:24.911 --> 07:27.923
You're helping children
and saving turtles.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.250
- Yeah, planning this
event is a headache, man.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.364
- Now it's just the alligators
that could use your help.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.766
- Shush, don't judge
my shoes, OK?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.068
And if I see your little
camera in my event,

07:40.092 --> 07:41.092
I'm gonna kick your ass.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.775
- I'm just joking sweetie, plus
I don't vlog about turtles,

07:46.799 --> 07:49.545
I vlog about outrageous
self-by stuff.

07:49.569 --> 07:51.246
- Ah, that's much better.

07:51.270 --> 07:56.385
- Karma comes your way when you
give back to the universe.

07:56.409 --> 08:01.581
- Om. Shut up.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.441
- I can't believe I
missed that shot.

08:52.465 --> 08:56.612
- Don't worry about it baby.

08:56.636 --> 08:57.846
It wasn't that bad.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.182
- Yeah well, I still
should've made it.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.309
- Well, you'll get the next one.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.046
You're incredible on the field.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.151
- Hey, what do you
want out of all this?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.688
- The bubble bath?

09:18.057 --> 09:19.992
- No, you know,

09:20.860 --> 09:23.996
love, life, you know?

09:25.998 --> 09:29.912
- I just want what
everybody else wants.

09:29.936 --> 09:35.107
Security, happiness, money,

09:37.910 --> 09:39.145
love.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.859
What about you?

09:43.883 --> 09:48.897
- Well that's easy, I just
need to be near the ocean.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.390
I think that's why I
stayed in South Beach.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.305
You know, I just
wanna keep my focus.

09:56.329 --> 10:00.166
Work hard, maybe have a family,

10:01.367 --> 10:03.111
get a boat.

10:55.421 --> 10:56.832
- Hey Pam, I made it.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.201
- Sam, how are you?

10:59.225 --> 11:00.135
- Excellent.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.837
- Sam, this is Amy.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.972
She's the realtor I've
been telling you about.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.208
Amy, Sam here's looking
for a place in Miami.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.910
- Amy, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

11:08.934 --> 11:10.779
Pam's told me a lot of
good things about you.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.381
- Oh I hope so,
because I am good.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.915
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.174
- And she's a flirt.

11:15.741 --> 11:16.942
OK guys, you behave.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.187
I need a drink.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.211
- See ya.
- Bye!

11:23.916 --> 11:25.994
- So, a big flirt, huh?

11:26.018 --> 11:28.096
- Eh, it makes life fun.
- It does, doesn't it?

11:28.120 --> 11:30.098
- Mm.
- Yeah, it sure does.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.091
- So where do you live?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.202
- New York.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.303
I've got a place in
the city and a house

11:35.327 --> 11:36.471
out in the Hamptons.

11:36.495 --> 11:38.206
- Oh! How long are
you in town for?

11:38.230 --> 11:39.508
- Just a week.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.300
Business brings me
to Miami a lot.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.845
- And what is business?

11:43.869 --> 11:47.649
- Entertainment attorney
for a few celebrities.

11:47.673 --> 11:48.984
- Do you know Brad Pitt?

11:49.008 --> 11:50.886
- I can't disclose that.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.689
See, it's a little thing
called privilege.

11:53.713 --> 11:54.880
- Damn.
- Yeah.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.893
But yes, you would
definitely know some of 'em.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.328
- OK, well then, why Miami?

12:00.352 --> 12:02.597
- Well I have a few Latin
American clients down here.

12:02.621 --> 12:03.732
Mostly musicians.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.601
- Hmm.
- So real estate, huh?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.704
- Yeah.
- I'm looking for a place.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.905
A little condo on the beach,

12:09.929 --> 12:12.107
maybe with a nice
little ocean view.

12:12.131 --> 12:15.077
- I can definitely show
you some options, Sam.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.211
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.646
- Well we should
toast those options.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.181
What can I get you?
- More bubbly, please.

12:19.205 --> 12:19.948
- Will do.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.540
Bubbly it is. - Excellent, OK.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.653
- Thank you.

12:24.677 --> 12:25.921
There you go my dear.
- Thank you.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.480
- Oh you're welcome.

12:31.650 --> 12:32.985
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.922
- So Amy.
- Mm hmm?

12:37.857 --> 12:39.091
- Married?

12:39.692 --> 12:43.538
- Mm mm.

12:43.562 --> 12:45.030
- Boyfriend?

12:46.532 --> 12:47.909
- Hi!

12:47.933 --> 12:49.244
- How do you two know
each other again?

12:49.268 --> 12:52.280
- Well, I know Sam's family
from back in my New York days.

12:52.304 --> 12:55.951
- Yeah, I hate to admit how
long ago that was, but it's uh,

12:55.975 --> 12:58.019
oh ladies, I'm sorry,
could you excuse me?

12:58.043 --> 12:59.154
I see a friend of mine,
I'm gonna say hi to him.

12:59.178 --> 13:00.322
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.380
- Sure, take your time.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.393
- Power lawyer? Really nice guy.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.795
- A handsome nice guy.

13:06.819 --> 13:08.663
- Hey, don't even go there.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.732
He's got a wife
and kids at home.

13:10.756 --> 13:11.933
- So you guys have never like...

13:11.957 --> 13:14.202
- No! He's like my father!
- Really?

13:14.226 --> 13:15.361
- Yeah.

13:17.763 --> 13:21.443
- Hi, you know what, I
hate to flirt and run,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.745
but I gotta get back to the
hotel, I've got a meeting

13:23.769 --> 13:24.946
to prepare for in the morning.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.214
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.016
- I wanted to thank you for
your contribution tonight.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.519
My little ones will
really appreciate it.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.753
- You're welcome.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.054
This is your charity event?

13:33.078 --> 13:35.524
- Yeah, I've been organizing
it for about three years now

13:35.548 --> 13:36.658
during Art Bazzle.

13:36.682 --> 13:39.227
- Wow, well I'm impressed.

13:39.251 --> 13:40.529
- Thank you.
- Really impressed.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.330
- I will give you a call later.

13:42.354 --> 13:44.023
Thanks for the invite.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.158
Chow. - Chow.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.939
As you can see, the place
comes completely furnished.

13:50.963 --> 13:54.543
It's very spacious, the view
is absolutely breathtaking.

13:54.567 --> 13:58.013
It has a wrap around balcony
all the way to the other side.

13:58.037 --> 14:01.483
So, it's listed at 2.1 million,

14:01.507 --> 14:05.587
but we can make an offer
and see what they say.

14:05.611 --> 14:09.114
Pardon.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.085
Excuse me one moment.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.299
Hello? - Hey!

14:17.323 --> 14:18.533
- Hey, what's up?

14:18.557 --> 14:21.970
- Hey listen, I made dinner
plans with Tom and Ashley.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.029
- Dinner plans tonight?

14:24.964 --> 14:29.844
Oh you just, could've
told me sooner.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.270
- Can you make it?

14:32.905 --> 14:34.783
- Yeah, that's fine.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.284
- OK, sounds good.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.611
All right, I'll talk
to you soon, bye.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.963
Brava.

15:01.433 --> 15:06.281
- The Herald wants to station
Tom in Israel for three weeks

15:06.305 --> 15:09.884
so he can report about the
mess in the Middle East.

15:09.908 --> 15:13.989
- Wow, that is awesome!
- I am ecstatic!

15:14.013 --> 15:16.615
Missy here not so
much, but yeah.

15:17.983 --> 15:20.295
- It's ridiculously dangerous!
- Yeah.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.864
- People die there
every single day!

15:22.888 --> 15:24.466
- Look Ashley, you have
nothing to worry about.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.968
I mean, in Israel more
people die in car accidents

15:26.992 --> 15:29.838
than they do in
terrorist attacks.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.806
- I'm worried! I don't
want him to go!

15:31.830 --> 15:33.942
Amy, wouldn't you be worried?

15:33.966 --> 15:35.610
It's really unsafe there.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.546
- Yeah, I've read a couple
articles online about...

15:38.570 --> 15:40.882
- Yeah, I read this article
that they are building

15:40.906 --> 15:42.951
this wall around
the entire country

15:42.975 --> 15:44.719
to prevent the terrorists
from coming in.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.956
And since then, the attacks
have decreased dramatically.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.282
So he'll be fine.

15:52.217 --> 15:55.563
Ooh, hey, this Pinot from
New Zealand is amazing.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.800
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah we should get that.

15:58.824 --> 16:02.037
- Baby, that's a
$200 bottle of wine.

16:02.061 --> 16:04.396
- Yeah. No, I know.

16:05.497 --> 16:09.577
- I think I saw that Whitestone
cab we like so much.

16:09.601 --> 16:10.979
- Oh yeah, it's really nice.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.580
- No, I'm sure that's fine,
it's just, you know,

16:12.604 --> 16:14.406
this one's really good.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.986
- Really? I mean, can we
just do the Whitestone?

16:18.010 --> 16:20.755
Will that be fine,
can we just do that?

16:20.779 --> 16:21.779
- Yeah!

16:22.614 --> 16:25.460
Yeah, that sounds fine.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.895
That sounds fine.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.320
It's a good suggestion.

16:29.555 --> 16:32.767
If you will excuse me, I am
going to go to the ladies room.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.059
- Let me go with you.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.177
- You all right?

16:42.201 --> 16:45.780
- Oh you know, I just haven't
seen that side of Amy before.

16:45.804 --> 16:49.517
- Hey, comes with the territory
this side of the bridge.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.445
- Yeah, yeah I guess so, huh.

16:54.380 --> 16:58.059
- Miss, can we have
some water please?

16:58.083 --> 17:01.696
- Just regular
Miami tap is fine.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.764
Thanks.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.279
- Are you OK?
- Mm hmm.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.314
- Are you sure?

17:29.982 --> 17:32.494
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

17:32.518 --> 17:35.854
- I mean, we can...
- Don't worry about it, Nick.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.096
You know what?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.041
Why don't you just drop
me off at The Mansion.

17:47.065 --> 17:49.301
I think I'm gonna hang out
with the girls tonight.

17:54.506 --> 17:55.574
- OK.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.028
- Bye.
- See ya.

18:07.052 --> 18:08.554
- I'll call ya later.

18:12.658 --> 18:13.659
- Hi!

18:20.866 --> 18:22.143
Hi. - Hi.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.312
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm good.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.047
- Don't worry, she'll be fine.

18:26.071 --> 18:27.682
And we'll dance it up tomorrow.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.118
- Sounds good.
- OK, have a good night.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.052
- All right, you too.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.377
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:43.315 --> 19:46.060
- Oh, there's no way I'm
paying $40 for Valet,

19:46.084 --> 19:48.029
I'm gonna go park
it on the street.

19:48.053 --> 19:50.698
- I mean, we're already here,
might as well just pay it

19:50.722 --> 19:51.866
and have 'em take it.

19:51.890 --> 19:52.834
- Nah, I'll just find
somethin' around the corner.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.801
It'll be fine.

19:53.825 --> 19:54.836
- But we're here already.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.005
There's people standing outside.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.673
- Ladies, ladies...
- It's $40!

19:58.697 --> 20:00.808
- Why don't you girls
just wait here.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.877
I mean, it's only
gonna take a second,

20:02.901 --> 20:04.403
and we'll be right back.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.907
- I'll meet you inside.
- OK, I'll see you inside.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.893
Oh my God.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.538
I don't know what it is.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.840
- I don't know, it's just
like every time we go out,

20:32.864 --> 20:36.277
I just feel this pressure from
her to spend a lot of money.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.712
Like the other night,
we were at dinner,

20:37.736 --> 20:40.748
and she wanted to order
a $200 bottle of wine.

20:40.772 --> 20:44.852
- And he ended up getting the
cheapest bottle on the menu.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.421
It was embarrassing.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.189
- I mean, she knows
I just graduated.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.091
What does she expect?

20:50.115 --> 20:53.561
- It's one night, one bottle.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.898
That's it, it's like he doesn't
even try to impress me.

20:56.922 --> 21:01.235
- Or like tonight with
the $40 Valet ticket.

21:01.259 --> 21:03.605
- And now he wants to drive
around for 20 minutes

21:03.629 --> 21:06.407
looking for parking when, just
pay the 40 bucks for Valet,

21:06.431 --> 21:07.775
it's right here!

21:07.799 --> 21:11.045
- I don't know, I hope
we can work it out

21:11.069 --> 21:13.481
because I'm crazy about her.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.284
- I just hope we
can work it out.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.719
- All right, I'll
stop boring you.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.431
- That's actually really good.

22:03.455 --> 22:04.932
- That's like a lot of money.

22:04.956 --> 22:08.569
- Oh my God, I just got
the greatest idea.

22:08.593 --> 22:09.604
- What?

22:09.628 --> 22:11.639
- You have some really
great shit in there.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.876
You do! You really do!

22:14.900 --> 22:17.178
- What's going on in that
pretty little head of yours?

22:20.872 --> 22:24.786
- We can make an exhibit,
I'll put something together.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.411
- Interesting.

22:27.345 --> 22:29.023
And you'd put that all together.

22:29.047 --> 22:30.425
- Of course!

22:30.449 --> 22:31.750
I mean, it's what I do.

22:32.617 --> 22:35.530
- You're sweet, you are.

22:35.554 --> 22:39.267
- Mm! I love this song!

22:39.291 --> 22:41.803
- Hey stranger.
- Hello.

22:41.827 --> 22:44.405
- Why hello.
- Gonna dance?

22:44.429 --> 22:46.741
- Oh no.
- Oh please!

22:46.765 --> 22:48.609
Come on. - No, you go dance.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.345
- Come on!
- Pablo and I are catching up.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.714
Go on! - Please come dance!

22:52.738 --> 22:53.915
- Go.
- All right.

22:53.939 --> 22:57.418
- Oh yeah! I'm gonna
put that down.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.442
- Excuse me.
- Wait, where're we going?

23:21.466 --> 23:23.411
- We're goin' home.
- Nu uh!

23:23.435 --> 23:24.445
- Yes, come on.

23:24.469 --> 23:25.346
Let's go. - Nu uh, Sandra said

23:25.370 --> 23:26.681
we could go to that club.

23:26.705 --> 23:27.782
- I talked to Sandra and they
said that they were fine

23:27.806 --> 23:29.384
and that they were gonna
get a cab later, OK?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.185
- No, Nick I wanna
go keep dancing.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.553
- No, come on.
- Yes!

23:32.577 --> 23:34.522
- I think we've both had
enough fun for tonight.

23:34.546 --> 23:35.823
- Maybe you have but I haven't.

23:35.847 --> 23:37.291
- Amy please, can
we just go home?

23:37.315 --> 23:40.185
Please? Thank you.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.536
- Do you know a
successful realtor

23:58.670 --> 24:01.549
possesses both charm and class.

24:01.573 --> 24:03.618
You lack in neither
one of those.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.253
- I guess that means
you would make

24:05.277 --> 24:06.778
an excellent realtor.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.757
- You must be a good
judge of character.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.759
- I have a sixth
sense about people.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.595
- What does your sixth
sense tell you about me?

24:14.619 --> 24:19.567
- It's a little thing called
privilege, I can't disclose it.

24:19.591 --> 24:21.135
- Really? You're gonna
play that card?

24:21.159 --> 24:22.159
- Mm hmm.

24:22.694 --> 24:25.497
I also know Brad Pitt.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.576
- Oh, then I wanna
hear that story.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.203
- This place coming
up is spectacular.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.156
So?

24:42.180 --> 24:45.560
This is a two plus two and a
half, overlooking the bay.

24:45.584 --> 24:48.029
Comes with furniture included.

24:48.053 --> 24:51.232
It's listed at 2.1 mil, but
I'm sure it's negotiable.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.256
- Hmm.

24:53.592 --> 24:55.336
I'll take it.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.405
- Really.
- Really.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.773
- Would you like me
to make an offer?

24:58.797 --> 25:02.067
- Not yet, let's do lunch first.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.004
- Sure.

25:10.742 --> 25:13.855
OK, enough of this
real estate speak.

25:13.879 --> 25:16.224
Tell me a little bit about Sam.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.193
- Married, three children,
the oldest is travelling

25:19.217 --> 25:21.829
Southeast Asia before
starting Harvard Law.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.332
He's a risk taker, enjoys
the finer things in life,

25:24.356 --> 25:25.891
just like his father.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.093
- I can relate to that.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.707
- You gotta tell me somethin'.

25:32.731 --> 25:35.509
- Yes.
- Why are you still single?

25:35.533 --> 25:37.178
What's wrong with
the men in Miami?

25:39.638 --> 25:41.349
- There's a theory.
- Mm hmm.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.017
- That is true.
- Uh huh.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.920
- Most of the men in Miami

25:45.944 --> 25:47.955
are either married,
gay, or broke.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.757
- Ah, that's not gonna
work for you, is it?

25:49.781 --> 25:51.959
- No.
- OK, just checkin'.

25:51.983 --> 25:55.830
- Not, yeah no, it's
just not going to.

25:55.854 --> 25:59.166
There's a bunch of boys
here, and not a lot of men.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.904
- Ah, well all I can tell
ya is that the good men

26:02.928 --> 26:04.538
come down here,
spend three weeks,

26:04.562 --> 26:06.197
and then they go back.

26:10.802 --> 26:12.847
- Very confident,
aren't you Sam?

26:12.871 --> 26:16.074
- I have reasons to be.

26:19.945 --> 26:21.713
What are you doin'
the rest of the day?

26:22.714 --> 26:24.225
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

26:57.816 --> 27:00.828
- Right? It must've
cost like a fortune.

27:00.852 --> 27:02.296
- That is orgasmic.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.166
That one is going in
the gallery for sure.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.768
- I wonder if Nick would
break open his piggy bank

27:07.792 --> 27:12.340
and get you one? - Yeah right.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.732
- What if he did?

27:14.632 --> 27:16.034
What if he proposed?

27:18.103 --> 27:19.103
- I don't know.

27:21.439 --> 27:23.675
I mean, maybe, maybe he would.

27:26.211 --> 27:27.822
I know that I've
never loved anybody

27:27.846 --> 27:29.280
the way that I love Nick.

27:30.482 --> 27:34.462
But let's get real, he won't
start making any serious money

27:34.486 --> 27:36.030
for the next few years.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.056
- Yeah, but he has this like,

27:38.757 --> 27:42.060
amazing vibe and this Ora.

27:42.927 --> 27:44.763
Money isn't everything.

27:46.031 --> 27:49.910
- I just need someone
to take care of me,

27:49.934 --> 27:53.938
and pamper me a little
bit, and maybe spoil me.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.375
I don't know, I
think I'm worth it.

27:59.277 --> 28:01.355
- I just feel like if
you break up with him,

28:01.379 --> 28:02.847
you're gonna regret it.

28:04.916 --> 28:08.629
- Look, I don't make
much money either.

28:08.653 --> 28:10.831
I'm already up to my
neck in car payments

28:10.855 --> 28:14.035
and cell phone bills and
credit card payments.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.336
I don't even have
health insurance,

28:15.360 --> 28:16.494
what happens if I get sick?

28:21.900 --> 28:24.769
I just don't wanna end
up like my mother.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.910
I just don't wanna end
up like my mother.

28:36.314 --> 28:38.292
- Walk away right now.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.285
Not with the shoes,
just walk away from it.

28:43.688 --> 28:44.999
- What do you think of this?

28:45.023 --> 28:46.825
- I think you cannot afford it.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.003
- You always say that.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.138
- 'Cause, um, that
whole conversation...

28:51.162 --> 28:53.541
- OK, I'm walking away, I'm
walking away, I'm walking away.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.909
- Car insurance,
health insurance.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.744
- I know, I know, I know.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.012
- And the gallery opening?

28:58.036 --> 29:01.849
- Mm hmm, hold on, let me just,

29:01.873 --> 29:04.218
just try these ones
on, one second.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.913
Credit cards!

29:13.718 --> 29:15.386
289, I'll be right back.

29:17.322 --> 29:18.923
- Unbelievable.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.182
- Hey.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.450
- Hey.

29:47.652 --> 29:49.020
Hey, um,

29:49.988 --> 29:51.055
I called you earlier.

29:52.157 --> 29:55.035
- Oh yeah, sorry, Sandra and
I just went to the pool

29:55.059 --> 29:57.471
and then went shopping
for a little bit.

29:57.495 --> 29:58.963
- You went shopping.

30:00.198 --> 30:01.332
- Yeah?

30:03.768 --> 30:05.203
- I'm just,

30:06.671 --> 30:11.318
just kinda wanted to talk about
the last couple of days.

30:11.342 --> 30:13.187
- What about 'em?

30:13.211 --> 30:14.212
- Well, I mean,

30:14.946 --> 30:17.958
I don't know, you just seem like

30:17.982 --> 30:19.951
we've been kinda distant.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.991
- Yeah, I don't know.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
- All right.

30:29.961 --> 30:31.262
- I mean, I'm

30:32.730 --> 30:34.399
a little confused right now.

30:35.934 --> 30:37.168
- You're confused.

30:40.271 --> 30:42.941
Well, I mean, what
do you want from me?

30:45.677 --> 30:46.677
- I don't know.

30:47.745 --> 30:49.290
- Well, is there
something I can do?

30:49.314 --> 30:52.459
Do you need to take
some time off?

30:52.483 --> 30:54.228
Figure some things out?

30:54.252 --> 30:55.252
I don't know.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.522
- Maybe that's best?

30:58.790 --> 31:00.034
- Sure.

31:00.058 --> 31:01.226
Why don't we take some time.

31:02.493 --> 31:06.064
We'll figure things out, and

31:09.033 --> 31:11.069
I mean if you need anything,

31:12.670 --> 31:14.682
you know how to reach me.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.007
- OK Nick.

31:17.475 --> 31:18.610
- Good night.

31:19.877 --> 31:21.446
- Good bye.

31:48.906 --> 31:50.008
- Sorry.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.944
Yeah man.

31:54.445 --> 31:56.190
No, there's no one here.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.216
Too bad you're not here, bro.

32:05.423 --> 32:09.036
- Cheer up, things
happen for a reason.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.272
- How come nobody can
appreciate good art?

32:11.296 --> 32:13.907
- It's their loss,
you did a great job.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.909
We're both proud of you.

32:15.933 --> 32:19.370
- Nobody is here.
- Yeah, why isn't Nick here?

32:21.839 --> 32:24.142
- We had a little
talk last night.

32:27.845 --> 32:31.392
- Hey, I wish he was here too.

32:31.416 --> 32:32.717
- Thanks.

32:45.830 --> 32:48.542
Hi, I'm Amy Sands.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.729
- Honey, you have
some potential,

33:08.753 --> 33:11.432
but you're just not good enough.

33:11.456 --> 33:12.757
Next.

33:27.505 --> 33:32.377
- Ooh, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.190
I don't know why you're
trying to set her up already.

33:36.214 --> 33:40.627
Nick was a good influence and
he was madly in love with her.

33:40.651 --> 33:42.730
I liked him way better
than the older douche bags

33:42.754 --> 33:44.365
she normally dates. - I know.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.066
They were a good match,
I'm not saying that.

33:46.090 --> 33:49.903
But, what she needs now is
some crazy ladies' night

33:49.927 --> 33:51.405
and for us to cheer her up.

33:51.429 --> 33:54.708
- No, what she needs is a
good slap up side the head.

33:54.732 --> 33:57.711
- All right, just
let her alone, OK?

33:57.735 --> 34:00.647
It was her choice all
right, she wasn't ready.

34:00.671 --> 34:05.018
So now she needs us to take
her out, cheer her up,

34:05.042 --> 34:06.620
show her a good time, and
help her get over it.

34:06.644 --> 34:10.690
You know, maybe with
a night of mojitos.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.594
- Getting wasted is not
the answer to everything,

34:13.618 --> 34:16.697
and alcohol is a depressant,
you know that right?

34:16.721 --> 34:17.731
- Uh huh, whatever.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.900
That girl is bad enough
without my influence.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.804
- It's your deal.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.862
- I hate this holiday!

34:49.887 --> 34:50.931
- Watch.

34:50.955 --> 34:51.931
I got it.

34:51.956 --> 34:53.934
- OK OK, let's go
party, let's go.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.103
- See that girl over there?

35:30.127 --> 35:31.939
The hot one with the
little outfit on?

35:31.963 --> 35:33.140
Over there dancing?

35:33.164 --> 35:34.441
- Mm hmm.
- Yeah, bring her over here.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.465
- OK.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.302
- You guys good?

35:42.039 --> 35:44.718
- You are an incredible dancer.

35:44.742 --> 35:45.752
- Thank you!

35:45.776 --> 35:48.088
- Have you ever danced
professionally?

35:48.112 --> 35:49.389
- I'm sorry?

35:49.413 --> 35:53.327
- If you've ever
gotten paid to dance?

35:53.351 --> 35:55.062
- You mean like a stripper?

35:57.955 --> 35:59.967
- You see that guy over there?

35:59.991 --> 36:03.804
His name's Galvez, Mitch Galvez.

36:03.828 --> 36:07.574
He's one of the hottest music
producers in the country.

36:07.598 --> 36:09.743
He'd love for you to
audition for him.

36:09.767 --> 36:10.801
- Me?

36:11.869 --> 36:13.113
- He wants to meet you.

36:13.137 --> 36:14.338
Come on.

36:15.773 --> 36:16.874
- Go go!

36:21.479 --> 36:24.558
- Mitch, this is Amy.

36:24.582 --> 36:25.959
- Hello Amy.

- Yeah, can I make you a drink?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.736
- No no no, I'm fine, thank you.

36:35.760 --> 36:36.870

Bye. - Bye.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.678

37:17.702 --> 37:19.980
- He totally asked me to

37:20.004 --> 37:21.114
He what?

37:21.138 --> 37:23.450
- He asked me to
audition for his video!

37:23.474 --> 37:27.988
- Look, it's the guy
who made it rain.

37:28.012 --> 37:31.415
- Oh my God!

37:32.883 --> 37:35.996
- Well, where's my drink?

37:36.020 --> 37:37.355
Cheers.

37:38.689 --> 37:39.689
- Cheers.

37:40.458 --> 37:43.270
- Mitch, Amy's ready,
let's go shoot.

37:43.294 --> 37:44.438
- Make sure you
tighten up that shot,

37:44.462 --> 37:45.830
makes it more personal.

37:50.568 --> 37:53.447
OK, here's how this works.

37:53.471 --> 37:55.582
Right now, just don't be
nervous, just be yourself.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.318
Remember that phrase, "Dance
as if no one's watching you?"

37:58.342 --> 38:01.288
OK, I saw you in action last
night, you blew me away.

38:01.312 --> 38:03.957
All right?
- OK, just be patient.

38:03.981 --> 38:05.983
- I will, I promise.

People's people loved

41:21.045 --> 41:22.389
- But what.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.615
- It's not gonna happen
this time, babe.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.430
Some chick from LA.

So much to talk about,

42:26.877 --> 42:29.747
Hey guys, look who I found!

42:31.548 --> 42:33.717
- It's Robert,
your little crush.

42:35.719 --> 42:36.863
Robert Silver.

42:36.887 --> 42:39.733
- Wow, Sandra, how are you?

42:39.757 --> 42:41.167
- I'm good, how are you?

42:41.191 --> 42:42.235
- Good good!

42:42.259 --> 42:44.137
- You remember Amy.

42:44.161 --> 42:45.538
- Yes.
- Oh Robert.

42:45.562 --> 42:47.941
- Who could forget Amy Sands?

42:47.965 --> 42:49.910
How are you?
- Very good to see you.

42:49.934 --> 42:51.778
- Same here, you look fantastic.

42:51.802 --> 42:52.836
- Thank you, so do you!

42:53.737 --> 42:55.882
- Someone told me
you're a realtor?

42:55.906 --> 42:58.151
- Mm hmm, you heard correctly.

42:58.175 --> 42:59.386
- What do you do?

42:59.410 --> 43:01.721
- I'm a builder,
uh Coconut Grove.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.323
- Oh OK, very cool!
- Excuse me.

43:03.347 --> 43:04.558
I'm just gonna talk to someone.

43:04.582 --> 43:05.816
- Yeah, sure.

43:08.786 --> 43:11.631
So, do you like what you do?

43:11.655 --> 43:13.833
- Yeah yeah, well
after grad school,

43:13.857 --> 43:15.936
I started this whole
developing thing.

43:15.960 --> 43:20.473
I like to build, so...
- Cool, so you do well.

43:20.497 --> 43:22.066
- It pays the bills.

43:23.133 --> 43:24.477
- I see.
- Yeah.

43:24.501 --> 43:26.146
What about you.

43:26.170 --> 43:27.338
- Oh um,

43:28.105 --> 43:29.215
well since school,

43:29.239 --> 43:32.919
I tried the art thing
for a little while,

43:32.943 --> 43:34.988
but of course no money there.

43:35.012 --> 43:38.191
So then I thought about
teaching and dancing...

43:38.215 --> 43:40.160
- Oh that's right, 'cause
you used to dance.

43:40.184 --> 43:42.419
- Yeah, still do.

43:43.854 --> 43:46.499
But now I just do
the realtor thing.

43:46.523 --> 43:47.767
Like the other 50% of Miami.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.902
- Like all of us.

43:48.926 --> 43:50.670
Yeah, somehow we all
seem to be tied

43:50.694 --> 43:52.572
to the real estate wave.

43:52.596 --> 43:54.031
- Makes sense.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.935
- So you married?

44:00.104 --> 44:01.104
- No.

44:02.940 --> 44:04.150
Are you?

44:04.174 --> 44:08.555
- No, no no no, I just got out
of a long relationship with a

44:08.579 --> 44:10.957
broken heart, no, I'm
gonna take my time.

44:10.981 --> 44:14.184
- Oh, poor Robert, I'm so sorry.

44:15.886 --> 44:19.699
No, I understand, Miami can be

44:19.723 --> 44:22.335
a really lonely city sometimes.

44:22.359 --> 44:25.739
- Really? Lonely?
- Yeah.

44:25.763 --> 44:27.640
- Oh no, I don't
see that, at all.

44:27.664 --> 44:30.910
Miami's full of energy,
people are always eager

44:30.934 --> 44:34.347
to go out and party, not lonely.

44:34.371 --> 44:36.373
- Yeah no, I know, but you know,

44:37.541 --> 44:40.120
I don't know, it would just
be nice to have a little bit

44:40.144 --> 44:42.589
of variety every once
in a while, like

44:42.613 --> 44:44.024
seasons for instance.

44:44.048 --> 44:46.926
Like bit of winter,
you could go inside

44:46.950 --> 44:50.930
and cuddle up next to someone,
next to a fire place,

44:50.954 --> 44:56.026
and, you know, have a
hot pot of soup and,

44:58.629 --> 45:01.007
I'm hungry!

45:01.031 --> 45:03.443
Are you? - You saw that well,

45:03.467 --> 45:04.477
I'm hungry too.

45:04.501 --> 45:05.845
You want bar food?

45:05.869 --> 45:08.048
Or do you wanna go for sushi?

45:08.072 --> 45:09.049
I know a great place. - Yeah!

45:09.073 --> 45:10.450
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

45:10.474 --> 45:11.685
Let's sushi. - Awesome.

45:11.709 --> 45:12.819
- OK.
- OK.

45:12.843 --> 45:13.687
- Cool, you wanna go say
good bye to everybody?

45:13.711 --> 45:15.813
OK, let's go.

45:22.753 --> 45:24.021
Bye baby!

45:45.542 --> 45:48.088
You know Robert, back in college

45:48.112 --> 45:51.658
I used to have a
huge crush on you.

45:51.682 --> 45:53.259
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

45:53.283 --> 45:54.818
- Nu uh, come on.

45:55.385 --> 45:56.954
I never noticed.

45:58.155 --> 45:59.799
- Well maybe that's
because you were obsessed

45:59.823 --> 46:01.925
with that Lauren chick.

46:03.760 --> 46:05.972
- Lauren, wow.

46:05.996 --> 46:08.341
How do you even
remember that name?

46:08.365 --> 46:10.510
- Oh, I don't know,

46:10.534 --> 46:11.911
maybe because her name was

46:11.935 --> 46:15.081
stuck in the back of my
throat for about four years.

46:20.177 --> 46:23.823
- Yeah well Lauren ended
up moving to France,

46:23.847 --> 46:26.559
chasing some artist.

46:26.583 --> 46:28.051
- Oh.

46:28.952 --> 46:32.298
It was Lauren who
broke your heart.

46:32.322 --> 46:33.957
- Bingo.

46:34.658 --> 46:35.826
Yeah.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.838
That's the one.

46:38.862 --> 46:40.573
Now we both have a
reason to hate her.

46:40.597 --> 46:43.676
- Gah, I knew she was bad news.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.044
- Well you should've told me.

46:45.068 --> 46:46.068
- Well,

46:46.336 --> 46:47.914
who is the guy?

46:47.938 --> 46:51.117
- Who cares, some
French dick head.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.143
They met at the Art Bazzle.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.722
- Did you ever propose?

46:55.746 --> 46:56.923
- No.

46:56.947 --> 46:58.458
There was no need to.

46:58.482 --> 47:02.529
We were comfortable,
we had a good thing.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.621
- You were very comfortable.

47:05.923 --> 47:08.334
Six years and no ring?

47:08.358 --> 47:11.037
Robert.
- Nah, that's not the reason

47:11.061 --> 47:14.674
she left, it's just...

47:14.698 --> 47:15.698
- Mm mm.

47:16.300 --> 47:19.203
Trust me, women are not
gonna wait around forever.

47:20.971 --> 47:22.940
You should know
better than that.

47:26.643 --> 47:28.354
- Hindsight's 20/20, right?

47:28.378 --> 47:31.024
So I guess now I'm gonna
have to treat my next girl

47:31.048 --> 47:34.051
extra, extra nice.

47:35.385 --> 47:36.386
- I guess so.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.431
- Cheers.

47:38.455 --> 47:40.415
- Well, I have none 'cause
you didn't pour me any.

47:50.901 --> 47:52.135
- Well.

47:58.008 --> 48:00.753
- What.
- It was a very fun,

48:00.777 --> 48:03.723
surprisingly wonderful evening.

48:03.747 --> 48:05.992
- Yeah, yeah I had
a great time too.

48:06.016 --> 48:08.118
- Yeah, thank you.

48:08.852 --> 48:10.563
- Thank you.

48:10.587 --> 48:11.955
- Bye.
- Bye.

48:16.460 --> 48:18.471
- Woo, Robert Robert.

48:18.495 --> 48:19.529
Robert.

48:21.164 --> 48:22.399
Robert.

48:25.569 --> 48:26.569
- Yes?

48:27.304 --> 48:29.816
- Look, I'm really glad
we reconnected, I just...

48:29.840 --> 48:31.050
- You don't have to do this.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.886
- But I wanna...
- I understand.

48:33.910 --> 48:35.412
It's OK.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.983
Can I call you sometime?

48:41.885 --> 48:43.153
- How 'bout I call you?

48:45.489 --> 48:47.991
- OK, fair enough.

48:48.892 --> 48:52.129
But you will call.
- If you're lucky.

48:54.798 --> 48:55.966
- OK.

49:12.516 --> 49:13.926
OK. - OK.

49:13.950 --> 49:16.053
- Drive safely.
- Thank you!

49:22.092 --> 49:24.061
Hasta luego, senorita.

49:26.396 --> 49:27.731
Oh.

49:28.732 --> 49:32.002
Oh, come here!

49:37.074 --> 49:40.353
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too!

49:40.377 --> 49:42.322
- Just take care of yourself.

49:42.346 --> 49:44.014
- Of course.

49:49.519 --> 49:50.964
- You wanna help me
with these boxes?

49:50.988 --> 49:52.932
- No.
- Please?

49:52.956 --> 49:53.956
- K.

49:54.758 --> 49:56.126
- I will get this.

50:06.970 --> 50:11.041
- Sam, when can I see you again?

50:11.975 --> 50:14.153
- I have to get
back to New York.

50:14.177 --> 50:16.022
I have to seal this deal.
- Mm hmm.

50:16.046 --> 50:17.924
- It should take about a month.

50:17.948 --> 50:19.383
- A month?
- Yeah.

50:20.117 --> 50:21.394
- I can't wait that long.

50:21.418 --> 50:23.396
- I know, but I'll make
it worth your wait.

50:23.420 --> 50:27.333
Do a little vacation, I'll
take you skiing in Aspen, OK?

50:27.357 --> 50:29.102
- Aspen?
- Yeah.

50:29.126 --> 50:30.470
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

50:37.601 --> 50:39.946
- I've never even
seen snow before.

50:39.970 --> 50:41.280
- Oh, you'll see snow.

50:41.304 --> 50:43.585
See, it'll give you a little
somethin' to look forward to.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.711
- Sam?
- Hmm.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.925
- I miss you when
you're not here.

50:52.949 --> 50:54.751
- I miss you too.

50:55.786 --> 50:57.487
Let's get out of here.

51:12.936 --> 51:14.180
I'll tell you what.

51:14.204 --> 51:17.450
Why don't you go on
up to the condo,

51:17.474 --> 51:19.619
open a nice little
bottle of wine,

51:19.643 --> 51:21.821
gotta check with
our man over here

51:21.845 --> 51:23.256
about my ride to
the airport, OK?

51:23.280 --> 51:24.891
- OK.
- OK.

51:36.226 --> 51:37.937
You make sure that you'll let
me know what she's up to

51:37.961 --> 51:40.730
when I'm outta town, OK?

51:42.432 --> 51:43.432
Oh.

51:45.001 --> 51:46.636
Really let me know.

51:48.004 --> 51:49.004
Have a good night.

52:07.457 --> 52:10.603
- Hello?
- Hello Amy?

52:10.627 --> 52:12.872
- Yes, who's this?

52:12.896 --> 52:14.564
- Take a wild guess.

52:15.332 --> 52:17.944
- OK, keep talking.

52:17.968 --> 52:19.312
- You have the sweetest smile,

52:19.336 --> 52:21.505
this side of the Mississippi.

52:22.739 --> 52:27.053
- Uh? I'm sorry, I
still don't know.

52:27.077 --> 52:29.055
- Oh come on, it's Robert.

52:29.079 --> 52:30.180
- Robert.

52:31.648 --> 52:32.883
Hi.

52:33.750 --> 52:34.994
How are you?

52:35.018 --> 52:36.762
How did you get my number?

52:36.786 --> 52:39.966
- Well let's just say I'm
a very resourceful man.

52:39.990 --> 52:41.767
- Yeah, I can see that.

52:41.791 --> 52:44.070
- Look, it's been a couple
weeks and you haven't called

52:44.094 --> 52:46.739
and I wanted to ask
you to dinner again.

52:46.763 --> 52:49.442
I had a really good
time last time.

52:49.466 --> 52:52.802
- Yeah me too Robert, but um...

52:54.404 --> 52:56.973
Look, I really don't
wanna complicate things.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.278
- Why? It's just dinner.

53:02.812 --> 53:07.059
- Come on Robert, we
both know better.

53:07.083 --> 53:08.461
- I know, I just thought that...

53:08.485 --> 53:11.097
- Look, let me figure
some stuff out.

53:11.121 --> 53:13.957
And, I will call you.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.429
- OK, you go figure out.

53:20.497 --> 53:22.332
- OK I'll talk to you later.

53:24.067 --> 53:25.067
Bye.

53:31.308 --> 53:35.555
- Robert called me.
- Really? And?

53:35.579 --> 53:38.848
- I don't know, I'm confused.

53:40.850 --> 53:41.985
I'm with Sam.

53:44.254 --> 53:46.799
- Yeah, but you're
not really with Sam.

53:46.823 --> 53:47.958
- What does that mean?

53:50.560 --> 53:52.796
No tell me, what does that mean?

53:54.531 --> 53:55.999
- 'Cause he's fuckin' married.

53:57.067 --> 53:58.468
- Oh I got that.

53:59.836 --> 54:01.347
I know that.

54:01.371 --> 54:03.549
- You realize that you're
his mistress, right?

54:03.573 --> 54:04.817
- Why don't you say it louder

54:04.841 --> 54:07.577
so all these other
people can hear you.

54:08.812 --> 54:11.324
Look, he makes me happy.

54:11.348 --> 54:13.559
- What, with material things?

54:13.583 --> 54:15.852
- No, I'm not a gold digger.

54:16.820 --> 54:20.766
I just want what every
other woman wants.

54:20.790 --> 54:22.935
If a girl out there says
she doesn't want security

54:22.959 --> 54:26.863
and to be pampered by a man,
she is a flat out liar.

54:28.565 --> 54:32.812
The only difference is, I
have the balls to say it.

54:32.836 --> 54:36.449
- Fine. I love you but
you're fucking up your life.

54:36.473 --> 54:37.917
- I didn't hear you.

54:37.941 --> 54:40.844
- I love you but you're
fucking up your life!

54:50.053 --> 54:51.664
- Oh!
- Oh oh oh.

54:51.688 --> 54:53.723
Sandra! Wow, hey, how are you?

54:54.658 --> 54:57.303
It's nice to bump
into you, literally.

54:57.327 --> 54:59.338
- I'm good. Yourself,
how's work?

54:59.362 --> 55:01.841
- Yeah, I guess I'm
a little, a step up

55:01.865 --> 55:04.377
from the last time you saw me.

55:04.401 --> 55:07.003
- Yeah, you don't even
have to go into that.

55:12.776 --> 55:15.655
She's doing good. - Oh good.

55:15.679 --> 55:16.679
Good.

55:16.946 --> 55:18.424
What's she been up to?

55:18.448 --> 55:20.459
- She tried the art
thing, that didn't work.

55:20.483 --> 55:22.194
She tried the dancing,
that didn't work,

55:22.218 --> 55:23.629
so she's doing real estate now.

55:23.653 --> 55:25.131
- Oh wow, how's
that goin' for her?

55:25.155 --> 55:26.666
- Really great actually.

55:26.690 --> 55:29.793
- Good. Now does she
still live with you?

55:30.827 --> 55:32.972
- Uh, no she's got
her own place.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.130
- Well good, good.

55:35.865 --> 55:37.934
- Look, I don't
wanna overstep, but

55:40.537 --> 55:42.114
I just want you to know that

55:42.138 --> 55:43.138
she loved you.

55:44.340 --> 55:47.420
And sometimes she can't
express herself, but

55:47.444 --> 55:48.978
she's a good girl.

55:53.450 --> 55:54.784
- Thanks.

55:57.587 --> 56:00.700
- Anyways, it was
nice to see you!

56:00.724 --> 56:01.634
- Yeah, it was good
to see you too.

56:01.658 --> 56:02.835
- Yeah, yeah you too.

56:02.859 --> 56:04.060
- Enjoy the rest of your day.

56:05.361 --> 56:06.272
- Thanks.

56:06.296 --> 56:07.764
- See ya.
- Bye.

56:14.804 --> 56:17.717
- Oh my God girl, I'm
gonna have the best Aspen

56:17.741 --> 56:20.052
in Colorado. - Yeah you are!

56:20.076 --> 56:21.253
- I'm so excited!

56:21.277 --> 56:25.524
So he flied in on Wednesday and
we both fly out on Friday.

56:25.548 --> 56:27.026
- Oh that's perfect.

56:27.050 --> 56:27.793
You're gonna look so hot.

56:27.817 --> 56:29.152
- Oh my God I...

56:30.220 --> 56:31.831
Oh, baby, let me
call you back, OK?

56:31.855 --> 56:33.156
- All right.
- OK, bye.

56:35.291 --> 56:36.469
- Hi baby!

56:36.493 --> 56:37.970
- Hey how are you?

56:37.994 --> 56:40.072
- Great, just checking
out some ski pants.

56:40.096 --> 56:41.440
How are you?

56:41.464 --> 56:43.843
- Yeah, ya see, that's what
I'm callin' you about.

56:43.867 --> 56:46.178
The deal with this client got
postponed by three weeks

56:46.202 --> 56:50.173
to let their other attorneys
finish up on their documents.

56:51.975 --> 56:53.185
- So what are you saying?

56:53.209 --> 56:55.187
- Well, what I'm saying is
I have to stay in New York

56:55.211 --> 56:56.880
until we close this deal.

56:58.748 --> 57:01.894
- You know I was all
about this ski trip.

57:01.918 --> 57:04.029
- Were you all about the skiing,

57:04.053 --> 57:05.555
or all about seeing me?

57:07.590 --> 57:09.459
- You know I hate your job Sam.

57:10.326 --> 57:11.694
Of course this was about you.

57:12.729 --> 57:15.007
- Oh come on, there's
no need to overreact.

57:15.031 --> 57:16.900
- I'm not overreacting.

57:19.803 --> 57:23.449
You just don't see me
for three weeks and

57:23.473 --> 57:26.886
cancel me at the last
minute, that's all.

57:26.910 --> 57:27.911
- OK look look.

57:29.045 --> 57:30.756
I really don't have time
for this, I got a lot

57:30.780 --> 57:33.216
of work to do, I'll just
give you a call later, OK?

57:36.753 --> 57:40.123
- Sure, K.
- All right, bye.

57:52.836 --> 57:54.713
- Oh hey baby!
- Hey babe.

57:54.737 --> 57:56.282
We are all set for the weekend!

57:56.306 --> 57:57.616
- Really!

57:57.640 --> 58:00.052
- I am taking you to Aspen.

58:00.076 --> 58:03.622
- Aspen? Oh my God!

58:03.646 --> 58:05.558
I'm really looking
forward to it!

58:05.582 --> 58:07.827
All right, we're gonna
have so much fun.

58:07.851 --> 58:11.187
All right, I'll talk
to you soon, bye!

58:13.456 --> 58:14.466
- Hello?

58:14.490 --> 58:16.635
- Hey Robert, it's Amy.

58:16.659 --> 58:19.839
- Wow! What a nice surprise!

58:19.863 --> 58:21.974
- Hey is that dinner
offer still standing?

58:21.998 --> 58:25.077
- Oh absolutely,
how 'bout tonight?

58:25.101 --> 58:26.970
- Yeah, yeah.

58:27.637 --> 58:28.872
That's great.

58:30.840 --> 58:33.052
- Text me your address
and I'll pick you up.

58:33.076 --> 58:34.143
- OK, deal.

58:36.512 --> 58:38.924
- So what happened that
you decided to call?

58:38.948 --> 58:41.894
- Don't worry about it,
just be glad that I did.

58:41.918 --> 58:43.863
- Oh I am, I'm glad,
I'm very glad.

58:43.887 --> 58:46.732
And flattered, I didn't
think you would.

58:46.756 --> 58:48.901
- I told you I needed
a little bit of time.

58:48.925 --> 58:54.106
Plus, I already admitted
that I had a crush on you.

58:54.130 --> 58:57.109
- Yeah, six years ago.

58:57.133 --> 58:58.043
- Yeah well,

58:58.067 --> 59:01.947
maybe something about
the other night

59:01.971 --> 59:03.206
rekindled that.

59:03.873 --> 59:05.775
- Yeah?
- Mm hmm.

59:06.609 --> 59:08.278
- OK, now I'm really flattered.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.657
- Don't get too cocky.

59:11.681 --> 59:13.216
You still have to work for it.

59:19.889 --> 59:22.101
- Ah!
- Well that was somethin'.

59:22.125 --> 59:24.093
- Uh huh!

59:25.194 --> 59:29.775
I can't believe that took
me six years to find out.

59:29.799 --> 59:32.001
- Was it worth the wait?

59:36.172 --> 59:41.344
- You know, maybe I didn't
find out everything.

59:43.012 --> 59:45.591
- I don't think you did.
- Uh uh.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:04.443
- Did you know that there
are more stars in the sky

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:07.513
than there are grains of sand

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:08.814
in all of the beaches combined?

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.082
- No fuckin' way.
- True.

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.850
- No. You're fucking with me.
- Absolutely.

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:14.186
No I'm not, not yet at least.

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.946
Including the Sahara Dessert.

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:20.125
- How do you come up with this?

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:25.021
- 'Cause I'm well read
and educated and smart.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:30.269
- And great in bed.
- And great in bed, awesome.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:32.504
And very modest.

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:33.963
- Yeah really.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.910
- All right, let's play a game.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:38.711
- OK.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:41.013
- The three question game.

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:43.215
- OK?
- Yeah?

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.616
- OK!
- OK.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.319
- You first.
- OK.

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:49.946
How come at 25,

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:54.760
you live in such a beautiful
apartment and you

01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:59.965
drive a brand new car, and you
dress in the latest fashion?

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:05.871
- Because you are not the only
resourceful person, my dear.

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.573
I know how to save.

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:10.309
I was very good a
few years back.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.677
- OK.
- Mm hmm.

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:12.902
- I'll buy that.
- OK.

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:16.739
My turn. - Go ahead.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.709
- Do you still love Lauren.

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.949
- Lauren, um...

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:31.087
Look, I admit to you that

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.424
I was very upset
when it happened.

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:38.370
But I'm completely over it now.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:40.263
- You sure?

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.867
- My turn.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.938
- Would you date a
guy with no money.

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.046
- Let me put it this way.

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:01.918
Amazing guy with no money,

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.087
amazing guy,

01:02:05.354 --> 01:02:07.090
with money.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.471
I'm just being honest.

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:15.298
- Yeah, painfully honest.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.268
OK.

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:21.436
Your turn.

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:24.983
- Did you ever cheat on Lauren?

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.352
- OK, why do all my questions
have to be about Lauren?

01:02:27.376 --> 01:02:30.489
- Why do all my questions
have to be about money?

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:34.860
- Touche.
- Yeah, see?

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.462
Plus, I can ask you
whatever I want.

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:37.463
- No.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.665
- Yes.
- No, my answer is no.

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:44.160
I did not cheat on Lauren,
I'm a one woman man.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.332
- That is very rare, sir.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.443
- Hey, what's the deal
with all the man's suits

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:25.568
and shoes?

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.747
- Oh that's my step-dad's stuff.

01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:31.250
He stays here sometimes
on business.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:33.185
- How come you didn't
mention it before?

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:35.787
- I didn't think it
was really relevant.

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.915
Weird.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:57.276
I found this check for
$5,000 from some guy.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.178
- I told him that it was
an old sale that I had,

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.980
that they owed me
the commission on.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:02.981
- I mean, I just
gave her the phone

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.183
and she blew up on me.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:06.385
- Why is he going
through my phone?

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:07.944
It's private.

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.081
- I don't go through
his business.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:19.631
- I haven't felt this chemistry
with anyone since Lauren.

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:20.999
- I don't think
I've loved anyone

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:22.925
the way that I love Robert.

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:27.430
- Something's not right.

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:33.178
- So, we got you some love

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:36.439
for your trip to California.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:43.021
- It's just a little something
to help you find your

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:46.325
vibrational energy. - Yeah.

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:48.760
- Should I be scared?
- No!

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:50.195
It's important.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:52.088
It'll help you get
through the month.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:00.596
- It's orgasmic!

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:05.010
- You'd better use that,
that was expensive.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:06.678
It's good quality, latex free.

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:08.580
- It was on clearance.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:11.040
And it was outta the box.

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.752
- She's actually a hand me down.

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:15.721
- Ew!

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.089
- Does it work?

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:19.224
Ooh!

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.583
- Sorry.

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.362
- You should come
to the retreat.

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:26.064
It's one month,
tranquility, peacefulness,

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:28.000
you can connect to
your inner self.

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.701
No cell phones though. - I know.

01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:34.130
- Amy?

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.645
- I don't know.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.813
- Sam would've paid for it.

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.582
- You know he would've!

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:44.950
He worships you.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.185
But you gotta be careful
with that kinda privilege.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:49.054
You know, men can be smart.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:52.024
- Debatable.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.826
- Look, I know how
to handle Sam.

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.029
He has a very soft spot
in his heart for me.

01:05:57.053 --> 01:05:59.398
- Something very hard
in his pants for you.

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:03.602
- I thought you liked
Robert better?

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.937
- I don't know about better,

01:06:05.961 --> 01:06:07.873
just different.

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:12.911
You know, Robert
is a huge turn on.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:15.814
But Sam, I mean, when
he walks into a room,

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:19.342
is just such a presence.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:23.055
I don't know, I don't know.

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:26.024
I wish I could just mix
them both together.

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:29.118
That would be perfect.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:33.298
- Guess what princess, comin'
to see you next weekend.

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:34.733
- You know what I was thinking?

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.902
I'd love to take you out
on a cruise this weekend.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:39.237
- Yeah, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:40.739
- I thought you'd be a
little more excited.

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:44.976
- My company's organizing a
retreat in Jacksonville.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.044
- Is that some kinda training?

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:48.013
- Sorry I missed your
call last night.

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:49.848
- Who does a retreat
in Jacksonville?

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:51.183
- That's so unlike you.

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.684
- How long are you coming for?

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.286
- Last night was amazing.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.455
- I fell asleep at like
nine o'clock last night.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:59.391
- I managed to get Thursday
through Sunday off.

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:01.760
- My step-dad's
gonna be in town.

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:04.262
- OK, I promise to give you a
massage when you get back.

01:07:04.286 --> 01:07:05.864
- I'll take you to
the spa when I come.

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:07.899
- Looking forward to it!

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:15.070
- Oh hey.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.917
You must be Amy's
step-dad, I'm Robert.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.252
- Step-dad.

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:22.578
Yeah, right.

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.781
That's my tie.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.260
- Hey, wait.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.852
Wait, where do you
think you're goin'?

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:33.298
- Get the fuck outta
there right now.

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:34.366
Who do you think
owns this place?

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:35.367
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.267
You better start praying.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.202
After everything I've given you,

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:38.236
everything I've done for you?

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:40.372
You're one expensive fuck.

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.007
You weren't even
that good, ya slut.

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:44.275
- You wanna tell me what
the hell's going on here?

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:45.477
- Yeah, why don't
you tell him, Amy.

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.078
Tell him what the
hell's goin' on.

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:49.014
- Just say something, damn it!

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:50.882
- What, you believe this bitch,

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.051
when she told you I
was her step-dad?

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.052
Really?

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:54.853
You believed her?

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.221
Hey, you make sure
you let him know

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:57.680
how much I paid for
this place, OK?

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.416
Son of a bitch.

01:12:15.297 --> 01:12:17.375
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:18.977
- Hello, I'm off to California!

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.779
Leave a message after the gong!

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.023
- Hello?
- Gina.

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.047
Hey, it's Amy.

01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:36.561
Can you do me a favor,
can I come stay

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.263
at your place for a few days?

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:40.465
- Whoa Amy, what happened?

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:42.067
Are you OK?

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:43.759
- Sam caught me with Robert.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:48.106
- Oh shit Amy,
that really sucks.

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:49.865
I'm so sorry.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:52.577
I wish I could help you,
but Nolan's parents

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.136
are coming into town.

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.166
- What can I do for ya?

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:14.970
What happened Amy?

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.710
- I need a place to stay.

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.046
- Hmm.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.057
You disappear for a few years,

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:29.051
and then you expect me to
pretend like everything's good.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.189
- I need a mom right now.

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:37.025
- What happened?

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.736
- What didn't happen?

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.666
And then they both walked
in while I was in the bath.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.068
- Wow, naked?

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:12.837
- No Mom, I was in
my leather jacket.

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:14.973
In the bath.

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:15.997
Yes.

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:21.312
He wasn't even supposed to
be there until next week.

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:23.781
- Why would you get involved
with somebody just for sex?

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:26.751
You had everything you needed
with this sugar daddy.

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:30.379
- Mom, no lectures
right now, please?

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.086
What am I gonna do?

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:44.359
- This place isn't very big,
but you'll always be welcome.

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.840
- Mom, is it possible
to have it all?

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:03.311
Or is every relationship flawed?

01:18:05.747 --> 01:18:09.794
- Love by itself, Amy,
just doesn't cut it.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.997
Look what loving your
father landed me.

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:15.767
I gave him everything,
I sacrificed myself,

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.369
I gave him my heart, I gave
him my youth, I gave him

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:21.873
everything I had, and then some.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:24.042
He left me for a younger bimbo.

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.967
None of that was good enough.

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:30.248
They're all the
same, all of 'em.

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:31.406
Liars.

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:35.686
Mm, at least when
they support ya,

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:38.046
you don't end up in
a dump like this.

01:18:56.731 --> 01:19:00.778
- I've learned my
lesson, believe me.

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:04.873
- You know, every experience
shapes our lives.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:11.179
Here's to the new you.
- And here's to the old you.

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:17.228
- Um, I'll be back in a minute.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:18.252
- OK.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.055
- Hi!
- Hey.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:41.276
Hi Amy. - Hi Nick.

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.446
- How are you?

01:19:47.782 --> 01:19:49.927
- Pretty good.
- Good.

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.395
- How are you?

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:52.930
- Good, I'm good.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:57.592
You know, same job, same car.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:00.562
You know me.

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:02.430
- Yeah.

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:06.444
- How are you?

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.468
- Same.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:13.542
Dancing, selling condos.

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:16.511
The usual.

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:19.323
Are you here alone or...

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:23.185
- Oh yeah, she's
just an old friend.

01:20:24.419 --> 01:20:27.465
You know. - She's pretty.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.591
- Thanks.

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:40.344
- Hey Nick, I'm sorry about...

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:43.638
- Hey, don't even
worry about it.

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.575
I guess it just wasn't our time.

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:54.516
Uh, you know what, I got
a different number now.

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:59.988
You know.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:04.125
Well, enjoy your evening.

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.494
I'd love to hear from you.

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.097
Bye.

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:12.743
It was good seeing you,
have a good night.

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:13.911
- You too.
