MORRIS (VOICEOVER):

00:03.920 --> 00:05.005
Previously on Heartland.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.423
 Hey, Georgie, any
idea why there's

00:06.548 --> 00:08.048
a Westfield trailer here?

00:08.173 --> 00:10.010
 Your trailer showed up at
Heartland to pick up Flame.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.261
Why?
- OK.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.846
I can explain.
- You're riding him now?

00:12.971 --> 00:14.431
Is that it?

00:14.556 --> 00:15.890
 Well, somebody needs to
jump Flame in the Fall Finale.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.058
You're the one who quit.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.643
 You got exactly
what you were after.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.979
 Not yet.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.439
I want to win this thing.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.025
 Georgie, you don't have
to give up your dream.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.318
You just need to
find the right horse.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.403
 Phoenix.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.238
 My friend Lainy
is the one who made

00:30.363 --> 00:31.573
that post about you and Dylan.

00:31.698 --> 00:32.615
And it was so not cool.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.200
But I promise not
to let anything

00:34.325 --> 00:35.577
happen like that ever again.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.494
Deal?

00:36.619 --> 00:37.912
 Thanks for having my back.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.622
 That's what friends are for.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.666
 I think it's time to solidify
this partnership with more

00:41.791 --> 00:43.251
than just a handshake.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.129
 We all want to be here.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.923
So let's just do
it in a fair way.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.594
[music playing]

01:03.980 --> 01:04.897
 Come on!

01:05.022 --> 01:05.857
Get!

01:05.982 --> 01:06.900
Let's go.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.568
 Good.

01:08.693 --> 01:09.444
Up!

01:09.569 --> 01:11.112
 Get up.

01:21.998 --> 01:25.251
Get up there.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.044
Go!

01:26.169 --> 01:28.755
Get through there.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.549
Get.

01:31.675 --> 01:32.467
Get!

01:32.592 --> 01:33.385
Get up there.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.554
 Come on.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.515
[neighing]

01:38.640 --> 01:39.265
Move it up.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.266
JACK BARTLETT: Hey.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.935
You want to hear the latest?

01:42.060 --> 01:44.270
MITCH CUTTY: Yeah, what's up?

01:44.396 --> 01:47.607
JACK BARTLETT: Our friend
Stumpy's out of town.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.402
So he asked Tim to keep an
eye on his cows for him.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.071
Tim says sure, no problem.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.241
Then he up and leaves with
Casey to one of her rodeos.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.326
So guess who gets
stuck with that job?

01:58.451 --> 02:00.036
 I'm guessing it's you.

02:00.161 --> 02:03.039
 It's not the first time
I've had to pick up a ball

02:03.164 --> 02:04.124
that Tim dropped.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.375
You feel like tagging along?

02:05.500 --> 02:06.459
 When you thinking
about heading up?

02:06.584 --> 02:08.836
 Later on if that
works for you.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.005
 Sure.

02:10.130 --> 02:10.922
Yeah, count me in.

AMY FLEMING: Hey!

02:12.966 --> 02:14.551
Want a banana?

02:14.676 --> 02:15.468
 Uh.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.803
 Good girl.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.304
 Ugh, bummer.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.889
Wyatt's car broke
down in Calgary.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.391
- Well, that's too bad.
- Yeah.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.684
He has to wait for
a part to come in.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.102

02:26.688 --> 02:27.647
GEORGIE FLEMING MORRIS: Oh.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.857
Here, let me help you.
- Yes.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.150
Thank you so much.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.860
GEORGIE FLEMING MORRIS:
What's all this?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.029
LISA STILLMAN: Oh, just a little
project I'm going to work on.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.113
 It doesn't look
all that little.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.489
 No.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.324
I'm going to make
holiday wreaths for all

02:38.450 --> 02:39.659
my employees at Fairfield's.

02:39.784 --> 02:40.994
 Like from scratch?

02:41.119 --> 02:42.120
 Yeah.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.247
 I didn't know you were crafty.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.166
 Yeah, I'm so not.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.084
But I watched a couple
of videos online.

02:48.209 --> 02:48.960
How hard can it be, right?

02:49.085 --> 02:50.295
 I guess.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.963
LYNDY BORDEN: [laughs]

02:52.088 --> 02:53.423
AMY FLEMING: I think that's
Peyton that just drove in.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.716
GEORGIE FLEMING MORRIS:
What's she doing here?

02:54.841 --> 02:55.717
 I don't know.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.052
Let's go find out.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.345
I will be right back.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.679
You enjoy your banana.
Thanks, Lisa.

02:59.804 --> 03:00.638
 Yeah, yeah.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.474
No problem.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.391
All right.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.727
Look what I have.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.189
I'm going to make very
pretty Christmas things.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.523
GEORGIE FLEMING MORRIS: Hey.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.609
 Hi

03:12.734 --> 03:14.110
AMY FLEMING: Is
everything OK with Tyson?

03:14.235 --> 03:14.986
PEYTON WESTFIELD: Oh, yeah.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.071
He's great.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.114
That's partly why I dropped by.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.491
- For me?
- Yeah.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.909
It's just a little
something to say thank

03:21.034 --> 03:21.826
you for helping Tyson out.

03:21.951 --> 03:22.827
And me.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.871
 Well, thank you.

03:24.996 --> 03:25.789
You didn't have to do this.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.376
And you did pay me.

03:29.501 --> 03:30.293
GEORGIE FLEMING MORRIS: Wow.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.211
That's beautiful.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.754
 Yeah.
It is.

03:32.879 --> 03:33.672
And it's too much.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.048
 Oh, please.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.175
Tyson and I got a chance
to compete because of you.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.176
 Well, thank you.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.844
[cell phone chimes]

03:39.969 --> 03:42.722
 I have a training
session at my place.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.015
Do you want to come?

03:44.140 --> 03:46.101
 Oh, that would be awesome.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.936
But Amy and I are training here.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.397
 Well, it's pretty cold,
so if you both want to come?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.607
 I-- I think I
can make that work.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.441
 Great.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.401
It'll be fun to hang out.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.819
 OK.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.445
Well, I better get
Lyndy organized.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.738
I'll talk to Grandpa
and see if he can give

03:58.863 --> 03:59.989
you and Phoenix a ride over.
- OK.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.241
Awesome.
I'll get him.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.283
 I'll meet you there.

some horsies today.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.582
So you're going to spend

04:13.503 --> 04:14.671
JACK BARTLETT: It's just me.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.339
AMY FLEMING: How'd
it go at Westfield?

04:16.464 --> 04:20.593
JACK BARTLETT: Oh, I got Georgie
and Phoenix there, no problem.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.971
It's quite the operation
they've got running over there.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.389
And boy!

04:24.514 --> 04:27.559
This place looks a
little crowded to me.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.810
 Yes.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.437
I knew that babies came
with a lot of stuff.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.147
But we are definitely
hitting maximum capacity.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.149
 Is my Lyndy ready to go?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.567
 Almost.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.735
I just want to change her.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.111
But if you don't
mind taking this,

04:38.236 --> 04:39.654
I'll bring her over on my way.
Thanks, Grandpa.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.321

05:29.662 --> 05:36.252

Ah, ah, ah.

You dreamer, you dreamer.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.603
 What are you doing here?

05:53.728 --> 05:55.230
 Peyton invited me.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.856
I thought you were out of town.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.109
 Meaning you wouldn't have
come if you knew I'd be here?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.152
 I don't really
care either way.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.946
 Are you sure about that?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.406
Because it sounds
to me like you still

06:04.531 --> 06:07.075
might be angry about
the whole Flame thing.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.118
Can't we move past this?

06:08.243 --> 06:09.160
 Whatever.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.371
Just be prepared to lose.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.541
 Somebody sounds confident.

And isn't this a horse you
had in a hunt club ride?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.378
 Phoenix is an amazing jumper.

just surprise you.

you on the course.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.525
I normally give my staff a
really nice holiday bonus,

06:40.650 --> 06:43.111
but I just cannot
afford it this year.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.238
I still want to make sure
that they know I appreciate

06:45.363 --> 06:47.574
that they stuck with me.

You know what I mean?

 Uh, no.
No.

06:59.044 --> 07:00.503
I don't.

07:00.628 --> 07:04.841
I think they're probably just
happy to still have jobs, Lise.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.302
 What are you
looking at out there?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.638
 [sighs] I was
just up in the loft.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.975
And I don't know how
much longer those kids

can keep living there.

She's going to be walking
before they even know it.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.153
They're pretty much busting
at the seam, you know.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.446
 Um-hmm.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.156
And so you have
something in mind?

07:31.076 --> 07:33.578
 I'm not going to
be around forever.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.122
We all know that.

07:36.247 --> 07:40.627
So I want to give those
kids a parcel of land now.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.005
That way they can think
about building something

07:44.130 --> 07:45.256
if they want to.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.301
 Have anything to do
with the Tim health scare?

07:48.426 --> 07:49.803
 Yeah, probably.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.060
I don't want to just
leave my land in my will.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.813
I want people to enjoy
it, to be able to use

07:59.938 --> 08:03.525
it when they really need it.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.195
Be nice if I was still
around to see that.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.364
 I think it's a terrific idea.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.116
I do.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.202
 Got a beautiful spot
picked out for Amy and Ty.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.704
 Do you?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.205
And Lou?

08:17.330 --> 08:20.041
 Well I already gave Lou
the land for the dude ranch.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.753
But when the time comes, I'll
have a few acres for Georgie

08:23.878 --> 08:25.588
and Katie if they want it.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.716
 You will, well,
because you are a very

08:27.841 --> 08:29.968
thoughtful man, Jack Bartlett.

You really are.

saw Dylan over here.

he'd be back so soon.

face him sooner or later.

 Oh, don't worry about it.

I've always made a point to
ignore him and have fun anyway.

 Ready?

08:51.239 --> 08:53.575
 Oh, I-- I don't like
having my picture taken.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.701
 Oh, come on.

08:54.826 --> 08:55.577
[horse nickers]

08:55.702 --> 08:57.078
[camera clicks]

08:57.203 --> 08:58.413
 I'm going to post it
on "Equestrian Gossip."

08:58.538 --> 08:59.456
 No way.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.623
That site's awful.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.000
I don't look at it anymore.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.084
Not since it posted all
those lies about me.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.169
 Yeah.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.045
It can get pretty trashy.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.629
And Lainy was kind of a jerk.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.048
But the site's not all bad.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.424
You'll see.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.675
Soon enough people will
forget about all those lies.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.262
[music playing]

09:17.682 --> 09:20.060
 What do you think?

09:20.185 --> 09:22.937
 Uh, you're doing
this right here?

09:23.063 --> 09:27.025
I'm just-- I know it's
a lovely sentiment.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.443
 But--

09:28.568 --> 09:30.987
 Well how long do you
think it's going to take to,

09:31.112 --> 09:32.781
you know, to make all these?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.366
 Well, I have no idea.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.909
I have, I think, 15 or so to do.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.535
Why?

09:37.660 --> 09:40.121
 Well, I'm just wondering
where we might be having dinner.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.749
 Well, your routine
might be slightly

09:42.874 --> 09:43.958
disrupted for a day or two.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.753
But it shouldn't
take more than that.

09:46.878 --> 09:47.587
Oh!

09:47.712 --> 09:49.547
 Here they are.

09:49.673 --> 09:50.465
 Hi.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.591
 Oh, wow.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.550
 I know.

09:52.676 --> 09:53.510
Isn't it great?

09:53.635 --> 09:55.220
 It's uh-- crafty.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.304
 [chuckling] Yeah.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.430
 Thank you so much
for watching her.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.723
 Yes, of course.
Of course.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.599
 There you go, sweetheart.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.184
 Hello, my darling.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.395
 And make sure that she
doesn't get a hold of these, OK?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.604
 No, no, no.
Of course.

10:04.729 --> 10:05.939
Yeah.
- OK.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.023
I should get going.
You be good.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.776
 Amy, do you have a minute?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.069
I'd like to show you something.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.405
 Yeah.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.656
 Bye.

10:14.781 --> 10:18.326
[music playing]

10:25.000 --> 10:27.043
AMY FLEMING: Grandpa,
what are we doing here?

10:27.168 --> 10:30.255
JACK BARTLETT: I know how
much you love this place.

10:30.380 --> 10:31.798
AMY FLEMING: I do.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.134
That view is incredible.

10:34.259 --> 10:39.014
JACK BARTLETT: Well, it's yours.

10:39.139 --> 10:39.806
 Mine?

10:39.931 --> 10:41.016
What-- what do you mean?

10:41.141 --> 10:44.894
 Yours and Ty's and the baby's.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.689
I'm gifting this
piece of land to you.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.607
 Grandpa, are you OK?

10:49.733 --> 10:50.942
 Never been better.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.986
Why?

10:53.111 --> 10:53.903
Oh.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.155
No.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.032
No, no, no.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.577
I plan on sticking around
for a long time yet.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.162
[chuckles] No, it
just seems to me

11:02.287 --> 11:06.166
that you're going to outgrow
that loft sooner than later.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.543
Well, I thought maybe
you and Ty might

11:08.668 --> 11:13.381
want to start thinking about
building a place of your own.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.634
 [sighs] Yeah.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.803
Thank you.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.806
It's really generous.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.642
Ty and I, we both
love this spot.

11:24.768 --> 11:28.229
[music playing]

11:35.945 --> 11:39.407
[horse snorting]

11:42.786 --> 11:44.371
 What's he doing?

11:44.496 --> 11:46.539
 Oh, he likes to record
a lot of the runs,

11:46.664 --> 11:47.832
so he can study them later.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.417
 Competitive much?

11:54.673 --> 11:57.008
His uh-- his jumps
are pretty high.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.301
 Yeah.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.511
We like to challenge the
horses during practice,

11:59.636 --> 12:00.804
so we raise them a bit.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.347
[cell phone chimes]

12:05.183 --> 12:06.101
See?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.894
It's already got a ton of likes.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.188
Even Dylan liked it.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.439
Told you.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.901
[music playing]

12:16.236 --> 12:18.697
JACK BARTLETT: Well,
she was surprised.

12:18.822 --> 12:22.075
But-- [laughs] I
think she liked it.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.034
 Oh.

12:23.159 --> 12:23.952
Ugh!

12:24.077 --> 12:24.786
This--

12:24.911 --> 12:26.538
 Everything OK in here?

12:26.663 --> 12:29.082
 Well this-- [chuckles]
this is harder than it looks

12:29.207 --> 12:30.333
in the video, I'll tell you.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.962
 You know, Lise,
I got to say, this

12:34.087 --> 12:35.797
doesn't really seem like you.

12:35.922 --> 12:36.881
 Why?
Why?

12:37.007 --> 12:38.341
What do you mean?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.719
 Is there something that
you're not telling me--

12:40.844 --> 12:42.387
again?

12:42.512 --> 12:44.681
 Well, I'm being audited.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.557
[chuckles]

12:45.682 --> 12:46.766
 Audited?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.644
 Yes, on top of
everything else.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.146
It's going to be fine.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.355
I don't have anything to hide.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.399
All my business
expenses are for real.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.859
And--

12:55.984 --> 12:57.694
 So how long have you
been sitting on this?

12:57.819 --> 12:59.404
 I got the letter last week.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.406
 And what are you
doing about it?

13:01.531 --> 13:02.657
 I'm carrying it
around in my purse.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.992
 Oh--

13:04.117 --> 13:04.993
 I'm going to do
something about it.

13:05.118 --> 13:05.827
I am.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.537
I just-- I haven't yet.

13:07.662 --> 13:12.667
 So that's what all this
wreath business is about.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.671
Lisa, you can't throw yourself
into something like this just

13:16.796 --> 13:18.173
to avoid that.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.300
 I need to do something
nice for my employees!

13:20.425 --> 13:21.634
We've had a rough year.
- I know.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.219
I get that.

13:23.345 --> 13:28.391
But if there's anybody you
do not want to put off,

13:28.516 --> 13:29.517
it's the tax man.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.518
 I know, Jack.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.020
I know.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.730
But do you realize how
much documentation,

13:33.855 --> 13:36.107
and all these receipts I have
to go through, and get ready,

13:36.232 --> 13:37.442
and send it off the accountant.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.360
It's just--

13:38.485 --> 13:39.652
 So what's stopping you?

13:39.778 --> 13:42.280
 Well-- uh--

13:42.405 --> 13:43.656
I can't do it at Fairfield.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.824
There's too many prying eyes.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.035
 Well then, set
up an office here.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.496
 It'll take up a lot of space.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.289
And if you want this
dining room table back--

13:51.414 --> 13:54.834
 Just bring your stuff
over from Fairfield.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.544
And take over one
of the bedrooms,

13:56.670 --> 14:00.215
get organized, and just
get down to business.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.634
 I will.

14:02.759 --> 14:03.551
Thank you.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.725
GEORGIE FLEMING
MORRIS: You made it.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.893
Dylan's up next.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.858
[music playing]

14:47.721 --> 14:49.222
 They're good.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.306
 Yeah.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.766
And if that's not
bad enough, Dylan

14:51.891 --> 14:53.476
will never let you forget it.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.937
 Let's see you do
better than that.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.401
MITCH CUTTY: So how
is Tim doing anyway?

15:01.526 --> 15:04.738
JACK BARTLETT: Oh, he
seems to be improving.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.406
He's getting back
to his old self

15:06.531 --> 15:09.284
more every day, for
better or for worse.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.410
[laughs]

15:10.535 --> 15:13.038
MITCH CUTTY: That's
good to hear.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.081
JACK BARTLETT: You
know, I don't think

15:15.206 --> 15:17.667
I'll ever get tired of this.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.295
MITCH CUTTY: Yeah, this mountain
air really helps clear my head.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.759
AMY FLEMING: Stay focused.

15:25.884 --> 15:26.760
And take your time.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.094
 You got this.

15:28.219 --> 15:31.931
[music playing]

15:41.733 --> 15:43.318
 Nice work.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.634

16:09.135 --> 16:10.178
AMY FLEMING: Georgie!

16:12.931 --> 16:13.640
Georgie!
Hey!

16:13.765 --> 16:14.641
Hey.

16:14.766 --> 16:15.809
Don't move too fast.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.102
DYLAN WESTFIELD:
Are you all right?

16:17.227 --> 16:18.770
 Yeah.
I'm fine.

16:18.895 --> 16:19.729
[horse neighs]

16:19.854 --> 16:20.689
 Phoenix!

16:27.320 --> 16:28.029
Phoenix.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.700
[music playing]

16:37.414 --> 16:38.206
Easy, boy.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.457
It's OK.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.375
You're OK.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.380
 Yeah.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.339
Will do.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.048
OK.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.092
Thanks, Scott.

16:49.217 --> 16:52.095
Scott's going to
meet us at Heartland.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.973
 I hope he'll be OK.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.057
 We've got to go.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.726
Georgie, now.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.436
 OK, come on, [inaudible].

16:59.561 --> 17:00.311
OK.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.396
I'm sorry.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.987
JACK BARTLETT: Well, you've
been a partner for a while now.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.320
What do you think?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.949
How's it going from
your perspective?

17:13.074 --> 17:14.659
MITCH CUTTY: Uh-- it's good.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.286
Yeah, it's real good.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.747
Look, Jack, I want
to say thank you.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.915
I appreciate how you fought
for me to get an equal share.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.791
I-- I know it wasn't easy.

17:22.916 --> 17:26.087
JACK BARTLETT: Ah, it was
the right thing to do.

17:26.212 --> 17:30.592
MITCH CUTTY: Hey, what's that?

17:30.717 --> 17:33.094
JACK BARTLETT: Giddy up.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.262
MITCH CUTTY: Come on.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.891
Easy.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.101
JACK BARTLETT: Oh, this fellow
wasn't born too long ago.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.644
MITCH CUTTY: No.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.564
JACK BARTLETT: Doesn't
look like he's nursed.

17:44.689 --> 17:45.523
 Aw.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.941
No.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.568
He-- You gotta--

17:48.693 --> 17:49.861
It's OK.
Shh.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.237
Shh.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.073
No, now we need to
get some milk in him.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.532
He can't even stand.

17:54.657 --> 17:57.077
 Leave it to Stumpy
to have his old nurse

17:57.202 --> 17:58.495
cow calving in the fall.

17:58.620 --> 18:01.581
I wonder if he even knows.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.458
It's going below zero tonight.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.292
 Yeah.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.210
It's getting cold.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.086
What do you think?

18:06.211 --> 18:07.087
Hypothermia?

18:07.212 --> 18:08.546
 Yeah, good chance.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.340
 Hey, we passed that
range cabin back there.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.424
What do you say
we get him inside?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.842
Maybe we can warm him up.
- Yeah.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.052
It's worth a shot.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.720
 OK.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.222
Come here, buddy.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.563
SCOTT CARDINAL: It's a strain.

18:25.689 --> 18:26.690
 How bad is it?

18:26.815 --> 18:27.899
 It's hard to say.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.943
There's a lot of inflammation.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.236
 So what are we looking at?

18:31.361 --> 18:32.737
Stall rest and massage?

18:32.862 --> 18:34.406
 Yep.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.658
And I have something else
that'll speed his recovery.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.245
[music playing]

18:56.011 --> 18:56.803
JACK BARTLETT: Here.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.141
I'll throw that on him.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.017
It might help a bit.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.560
 Thanks.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.312
 Let's see if I can't
get a fire going here.

19:10.817 --> 19:15.030
So you've been kind
of quiet today.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.531
You got something on your mind?

19:19.409 --> 19:25.331
 You know, well--

19:25.457 --> 19:30.045
You know, Jack, I thought this
partnership was the answer.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.715
It got me out of the office
and those boardrooms.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.219
But it's not.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.514
At least-- it's not entirely.

19:41.639 --> 19:42.474
 Oh?

19:42.599 --> 19:44.017
MITCH CUTTY: Don't get me wrong.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.019
I mean, these last few
months have shown me just how

19:46.144 --> 19:47.270
much I love the ranching life.

19:47.395 --> 19:51.858
But I just--

19:51.983 --> 19:55.028
I feel like I should have
more figured out by now.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.905
 Like what?

19:57.030 --> 20:03.995
 My goals, my life, what
I'm even doing with it.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.413
 I get that.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.920
But keep in mind that life
only happens one day at a time.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.346
 You know, this guy would
be doing so much better

20:21.471 --> 20:23.390
if we could just get
some food in him.

20:23.515 --> 20:27.519
 Why don't we see if
we can milk that cow

20:27.644 --> 20:31.147
and try to get him to have some?

20:31.272 --> 20:33.274
 That's a good idea.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.116
 This ice boot
should do the trick.

20:41.241 --> 20:44.869
It'll increase the circulation
and reduce his pain.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.037
 Easy, boy.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.455
It's OK.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.290
 How long should we
keep the boot on for?

20:49.416 --> 20:54.838
 20-minute intervals,
as often as you can.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.756
All right.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.050
OK.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.386
Good boy.

21:01.511 --> 21:02.971
I'll come back and
check on him tomorrow.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.264
 Thanks, Scott.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.640
 I'll walk you out.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.315
 It's all right.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.944
[horse nickers]

21:18.069 --> 21:20.613
It's going to be OK.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.907
 Lyndy's still
sleeping so sound.

21:23.033 --> 21:23.908
 Oh, good.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.326
 What's all that?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.870
 Oh, I just put some
snacks together for you

21:26.995 --> 21:28.621
and Georgie, if you get
hungry, because I know for sure

21:28.747 --> 21:30.165
she's not going to be
leaving Phoenix's side.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.833
 Uh, you're right about that.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.085
She insists on sticking
to Scott's schedule.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.004
 But not all night, right?

21:36.129 --> 21:39.841
 Well, as long as she can.

21:39.966 --> 21:40.508
How's that going?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.010
 Yes, don't even ask.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.845
It's just taking so much
longer than I thought.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.138
 That good, huh?

21:45.263 --> 21:46.681
You're sure you're OK
to look after Lyndy?

21:46.806 --> 21:47.807
 No, no, no.
I've got her.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.267
I've got her.

21:49.392 --> 21:50.560
And I'm going to move all
of that stuff out of there.

21:50.685 --> 21:52.228
You know how your
grandfather likes

21:52.354 --> 21:53.021
to make sure we can all sit
down and have a nice dinner.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.773
And oh-- Yeah.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.025
He told me to find another place
in the house to set up camp.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.526
 Yeah.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.569
Well, that's-- it's
probably a good idea.

21:59.694 --> 22:00.862
You should do that.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.531
Thanks.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.283
MITCH CUTTY: That's it.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.035
Good girl.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.954
 Stumpy's had this old
girl for a lot of years.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.373
 Yeah.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.125
My dad had one of these
old nurse cows too.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.877
[cow mooing loudly]

22:16.961 --> 22:17.796
OK.

22:17.921 --> 22:18.546
All right.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.341
That should be enough.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.760
 Good girl.

22:23.885 --> 22:24.803
[cow mooing]

22:26.262 --> 22:28.306
 It's OK.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.974
I'm sorry.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.518
[cell phone beeps]

22:37.107 --> 22:38.066
 Is everything OK?

22:38.191 --> 22:39.818
 Yeah.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.069
It's Wyatt.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.779
This part for his car
hasn't come in yet.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.739
So he's stuck in Calgary.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.825
He's staying with some friends.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.327
 I put some comfrey
in Phoenix's food.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.204
It should help reduce the
pain and inflammation.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.414
 Thanks.

22:57.627 --> 22:58.753
As soon as he's
finished, I'm going

22:58.878 --> 23:01.464
to get that ice boot back on.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.675
Maybe I shouldn't have forced
him to do those higher jumps.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.759
Maybe he wasn't ready.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.386
 You know that's not true.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.263
This whole Fall
Finale has become

23:08.388 --> 23:09.764
a horrible, competitive thing.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.307
And I let Dylan get in my head.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.561
 I understand why you feel
bad about what happened.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.730
But Georgie, there was nothing
wrong with trying those jumps,

23:16.855 --> 23:18.064
OK?

23:18.189 --> 23:22.068
It's not your fault. And
Georgie, for the record,

23:22.193 --> 23:24.821
there's also nothing wrong
with being a fierce competitor.

23:24.946 --> 23:27.449
That's one of the things
I admire most about you.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.036
[music playing]

23:34.914 --> 23:36.791
 This is none of my business.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.628
But what brought this
on all of a sudden,

23:40.754 --> 23:42.630
this self-doubt stuff?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.135
 I guess when I
started seeing what

23:47.260 --> 23:52.182
Tim was going through I just--

23:52.307 --> 23:56.770
I didn't want to waste
any more time, you know?

23:56.895 --> 23:59.564
 Yeah, I do.

23:59.689 --> 24:01.858
Truth is everyone's
days are numbered.

24:01.983 --> 24:05.820
It's probably a good idea
to keep that in mind.

24:05.945 --> 24:10.116
From where I'm standing,
you still got plenty of time

24:10.241 --> 24:11.326
to figure things out.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.911
You'll get where you want to go.

24:16.164 --> 24:18.625
 Right now I'd be
happy if we could just

24:18.750 --> 24:22.003
figure this little calf out.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.171
Come on, buddy.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.172
[mooing softly]

24:25.215 --> 24:27.801
 Is he taking it?

24:27.926 --> 24:31.137
 The inside of
his mouth is cold.

24:31.262 --> 24:33.348
 That's not a good sign.

24:33.473 --> 24:36.976
[music playing]

24:46.778 --> 24:48.154
LYNDY BORDEN: [coos]

24:48.279 --> 24:51.324
 Word to the wise, missy,
don't ever get audited.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.910
It's awful.

24:54.035 --> 24:54.869
OK.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.455
 Uh, what is going on in here?

24:57.580 --> 24:58.456
 Yes.

24:58.581 --> 24:59.457
Um-hmm.

24:59.582 --> 25:00.667
LYNDY BORDEN: [laughs]

25:00.792 --> 25:02.752
 You're not making
wreaths anymore.

25:02.877 --> 25:03.712
 No.

25:03.837 --> 25:05.255
I will get to those eventually.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.215
I really have to do something
nice for my employees.

25:07.340 --> 25:12.887
But I am-- I have a
very pressing business

25:13.013 --> 25:14.222
issue that I need to address.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.849
And quite frankly, I
was doing the wreaths

25:15.974 --> 25:17.600
to avoid doing all of this.

25:17.726 --> 25:20.395
So I'm going to be drowning in
paperwork for quite some time.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.230
And I have been
trying to figure out

25:22.355 --> 25:25.150
where I could make an office
at Heartland for a while.

25:25.275 --> 25:26.860
So this is it.

25:26.985 --> 25:30.155
 So you're turning my
room into your office.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.364
 Well, I did--

25:31.489 --> 25:32.782
I didn't think
you were using it.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.325
 Did Grandpa say that
you could move in here,

25:34.451 --> 25:35.493
like-- like, permanently?

25:35.618 --> 25:37.120
 No, not exactly.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.205
But-- I'm-- what's
the issue, honey?

25:39.330 --> 25:41.458
 I guess I just always
thought that this

25:41.583 --> 25:44.252
would be Lyndy's nursery,
you know, when we were here.

25:44.377 --> 25:48.298
And she can't sleep in
the playpen forever.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.924
So I thought that we'd
maybe put a crib in here.

25:50.050 --> 25:50.717
 Sure.

25:50.842 --> 25:51.676
I just-- I'm sorry.

25:51.801 --> 25:52.594
I didn't realize.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.429
I had no idea.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.389
But I just-- I need somewhere
to spread out and do my work.

25:56.514 --> 25:57.557
So--

25:57.682 --> 25:58.558
 We'll talk about it later.

25:58.683 --> 25:59.893
She's-- she's tired.

26:00.018 --> 26:01.227
I should put her to bed.
LISA STILLMAN: OK.

26:01.353 --> 26:02.520
I packed her things.
It's all in the bag.

26:02.645 --> 26:03.605
 OK.

26:03.730 --> 26:04.939
Thanks for watching her, Lisa.

26:05.065 --> 26:05.732
 Yep.

26:05.857 --> 26:09.277
[music playing]

26:16.368 --> 26:18.119
 Hey.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.329
 Hey.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.164
Bedtime?
- Yeah.

26:21.289 --> 26:21.915
She's getting tired.

DYLAN WESTFIELD: Hello?

AMY FLEMING: Hey, Dylan.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.253
DYLAN WESTFIELD: Hi.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.755
 Are you OK?

26:30.965 --> 26:31.633
OK.

26:31.758 --> 26:32.967
I should get you to bed.

26:39.224 --> 26:41.059
 Here to gloat?

26:41.184 --> 26:42.310
 I'm here to help.

26:44.604 --> 26:45.397
What can I do?

26:45.522 --> 26:48.983
[music playing]

26:50.443 --> 26:53.363
 Yeah, it's not looking
good for the little guy.

26:53.488 --> 26:56.157
We're going to stay with
him and do what we can,

26:56.282 --> 27:00.954
so don't expect me
home any time soon.

27:01.079 --> 27:01.996
OK.

27:02.122 --> 27:02.664
Yeah.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.166
I love you too.

27:05.291 --> 27:08.253
 You know, you don't
have to stick around.

27:08.378 --> 27:09.546
I can handle this.

27:09.671 --> 27:11.297
Besides, you got
somebody to go home to.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.841
 Oh.

27:12.966 --> 27:15.677
Well, I know how hard it
is to get a healthy calf

27:15.802 --> 27:16.761
to drink from a bucket.

27:16.886 --> 27:18.763
I'll stick it out with you.

27:18.888 --> 27:20.181
What do you got there?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.183
 Honey.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.812
My dad did something like this
with a calf that wasn't eating,

27:25.937 --> 27:28.648
only he used white chocolate.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.525
There we go.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.193
Come on.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.780
[music playing]

27:46.499 --> 27:48.043
(WHISPERING) Come on.

27:52.839 --> 27:56.051
That's it.

27:56.176 --> 27:57.218
That's it.

27:57.344 --> 27:59.220
 That's a good trick.

28:08.188 --> 28:09.522
[horse neighs]

28:09.647 --> 28:11.483
DYLAN WESTFIELD: Easy, boy.

28:11.608 --> 28:16.696
[cell phone beeps]

28:16.821 --> 28:18.531
That the boyfriend?

28:18.656 --> 28:20.533
 How'd you know
I had a boyfriend?

28:20.658 --> 28:23.036
 Peyton told me.

28:23.161 --> 28:25.622
So why isn't he here anyway?

28:25.747 --> 28:26.706
Wyatt's stuck in Calgary.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.583
Otherwise, he would be here.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.251
 Wyatt?

28:30.377 --> 28:32.754
Right.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.340
 What I don't get is
what you're doing here.

28:35.465 --> 28:37.550
 Why is it so hard
to believe that I was

28:37.676 --> 28:41.096
worried about Phoenix and you?

28:44.849 --> 28:47.560
Look, I know what
you're going through.

28:47.686 --> 28:50.230
I've been there with Arrow.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.607
And it sucks.

28:52.732 --> 28:57.529
And I was kind of hoping you
can keep competing because I'd

28:57.654 --> 28:58.780
like to get to know you better.

28:58.905 --> 29:02.283
[music playing]

29:06.329 --> 29:11.084
JACK BARTLETT: So let's
talk about mortality

29:11.209 --> 29:15.296
and goals and your life.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.799
Could this happen
to be about someone

29:17.924 --> 29:22.137
who's not in it at the moment?

29:22.262 --> 29:26.307
 I have been
wondering how she is.

29:26.433 --> 29:30.895
 Well I'm not sure,
to be honest with you.

29:31.021 --> 29:33.648
She's always busy.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.442
That's my Lou.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.944
Her franchise seems
to be coming along.

29:38.069 --> 29:39.988
I just hope she's happy.

29:40.113 --> 29:42.240
 Me too.

29:42.365 --> 29:43.450
[mooing softly]

29:43.575 --> 29:49.205
 You know I made a point
to stay out of this.

29:49.330 --> 29:55.545
But it did kind of
look like things

29:55.670 --> 29:59.341
were coming together for a
minute there, you and her.

29:59.466 --> 30:05.472
 Yeah, a New York
minute it turns out.

30:05.597 --> 30:08.475
I guess things could have
gone in a different direction.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.394
But they didn't.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.980
So--

30:14.105 --> 30:16.733
 Well, I'm not
going to pretend I

30:16.858 --> 30:20.070
know the details of everything
that went on between you two.

30:20.195 --> 30:22.447
But I will say this.

30:22.572 --> 30:26.242
You don't strike me
as the kind of guy

30:26.368 --> 30:30.163
who gives up on something
that still has a chance.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.712
How's our friend doing there?

30:37.837 --> 30:39.130
 He's better.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.508
But he's going to have
to stand and nurse.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.051
And I doubt that's
going to happen unless I

30:43.176 --> 30:46.638
can get him to go to the milk.

30:46.763 --> 30:48.390
 Thanks for helping out.

30:48.515 --> 30:49.557
But it's getting late.

30:49.683 --> 30:51.893
You don't have to stay.

30:52.018 --> 30:55.105
 I have nowhere better to be.

30:55.230 --> 30:58.566
Plus, I need to keep an
eye on my biggest rival.

30:58.692 --> 31:00.443
 You know what?

31:00.568 --> 31:02.570
There's a good chance
that's old news.

31:05.615 --> 31:09.703
 Look, I kind of
acted like a jerk

31:09.828 --> 31:11.913
when I cleared those jumps.

31:12.038 --> 31:16.084
I was just trying to
show off to impress you.

31:16.209 --> 31:20.505
 You and Flame looked amazing.

31:20.630 --> 31:22.966
I'm not proud of it,
but I was jealous.

31:23.091 --> 31:24.592
And I wanted to show you--

31:24.718 --> 31:29.222
to show everyone-- that we
could make that height too.

31:29.347 --> 31:32.392
So I-- I pushed
Phoenix to try them.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.894
And he got hurt.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.902
He means everything to me.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.612
What if he's not OK?

31:44.738 --> 31:48.199

32:01.087 --> 32:03.548
[calf mooing]

32:06.468 --> 32:08.470
MITCH CUTTY: Here you go.

32:08.595 --> 32:09.554
Come on.

32:09.679 --> 32:10.513
Yeah.

32:10.638 --> 32:11.639
Good boy.

32:11.765 --> 32:12.640
Come on.

32:18.355 --> 32:20.982
That's it.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.317
That's it.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.152
Jack.

32:24.277 --> 32:25.737
Jack!

32:25.862 --> 32:28.448
Look at this!

32:28.573 --> 32:29.407
 Oh.

32:29.532 --> 32:31.284
 Good boy.

32:31.409 --> 32:33.078
JACK BARTLETT: Oh, wow.

32:33.203 --> 32:36.247
Good for him.

32:36.373 --> 32:39.250
Yeah, he knows
what he wants now.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.543
 OK.

32:40.669 --> 32:41.670
Well, what do you say
we get him to his mother

32:41.795 --> 32:43.630
and see if he can start nursing?

32:43.755 --> 32:44.964
Huh?

32:45.090 --> 32:46.466
Let's do it.

32:46.591 --> 32:47.342
Oh.

32:47.467 --> 32:48.343
Whoa.

32:49.761 --> 32:50.845
OK.

32:50.970 --> 32:51.805
JACK BARTLETT: Get up, buddy.

32:51.930 --> 32:52.847
MITCH CUTTY: You can do it.

32:52.972 --> 32:53.682
[mooing]

32:53.807 --> 32:55.475
Get up.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.560
There you go.

32:57.686 --> 32:58.895
OK.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.730
There you go.
Go on.

33:00.855 --> 33:02.023
Come on.
Get some strength.

33:02.148 --> 33:02.982
JACK BARTLETT: [laughs]

33:03.108 --> 33:03.858
MITCH CUTTY: All right.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.403
[music playing]

33:06.528 --> 33:11.700
 Did you know, missy,
that your Gigi--

33:11.825 --> 33:16.287
yeah-- was up all night
saving a sick calf?

33:16.413 --> 33:18.206
And do you know what else?

33:18.331 --> 33:19.499
Your mommy and
Georgie were up all

33:19.624 --> 33:21.751
night too making sure
that Phoenix gets

33:21.876 --> 33:23.211
better as soon as possible.

33:23.336 --> 33:26.548
Pretty incredible people, huh?

33:26.673 --> 33:28.425
Look at that.

33:28.550 --> 33:31.886
You are one very,
very, lucky lady.

33:32.012 --> 33:33.263
Did you know that?

33:33.388 --> 33:35.015
And you know why?

33:35.140 --> 33:40.895
Because you come from a long
line of very resilient people.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.272
You do.

33:42.397 --> 33:43.481
Yeah, generations
of them that grew

33:43.606 --> 33:45.358
up right here on this ranch.

33:45.483 --> 33:47.819
And you know how they did it?

33:47.944 --> 33:49.863
By pulling together.

33:49.988 --> 33:53.491
Now that's not to say we
always get along or agree

33:53.616 --> 33:55.744
on everything because we don't.

33:55.869 --> 33:56.745
That's normal.

33:56.870 --> 33:58.038
It really is.

33:58.163 --> 33:59.456
The point is at
the end of the day,

33:59.581 --> 34:00.915
we're there for each other.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.335
And that's the important thing.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.795
Yeah.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.547
And I need to remember that.

34:07.672 --> 34:11.051
[music playing]

34:14.304 --> 34:17.056
 Oh, you've done a great job.

34:17.181 --> 34:18.891
There's already a
big improvement.

34:19.016 --> 34:21.895
I'd say he's going to
make a full recovery.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.897
I think he's ready for
some gentle exercise.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.023
 OK.

34:25.148 --> 34:25.982
How about some hand walking?

34:26.107 --> 34:27.859
 Sounds about right.

34:27.984 --> 34:29.860
 That's really great news.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.071
I'm happy for you.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.742
 Thanks for saying it.

34:35.867 --> 34:37.077
It meant a lot.

34:37.202 --> 34:39.329
 It was no big deal.

34:39.454 --> 34:42.081
I'm just glad it's
all worked out.

34:42.206 --> 34:45.960
But don't think this means
I'll be taking it easy on you.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.338
I'm still planning on
winning the Fall Finale.

34:48.463 --> 34:50.632
 Not if Phoenix and I have
anything to say about it.

34:55.178 --> 34:56.888
 Guess I'll be
seeing you around.

34:57.013 --> 35:00.475
[music playing]

35:03.895 --> 35:04.771
[mooing]

35:04.896 --> 35:07.607
 Yep.

35:07.732 --> 35:09.651
There you go.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.528
There you go.

35:11.653 --> 35:12.487
All right.

35:17.534 --> 35:21.371
 He was hungry, all right.

35:21.496 --> 35:23.415
Well, he's going to
get a bellyful now.

35:29.713 --> 35:30.505
Good on you.

35:30.630 --> 35:31.297
 Thanks.

35:31.423 --> 35:34.843
[music playing]

[cell phone chimes]

35:46.271 --> 35:47.022
LISA STILLMAN: Hey.

35:47.147 --> 35:47.939
How'd it go with Scott?

35:48.064 --> 35:49.482
 Uh, good.

35:49.607 --> 35:50.775
He thinks Phoenix is going
to make a full recovery.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.110
 Oh, terrific.

35:52.235 --> 35:54.195
I'm sure Georgie's
thrilled about that.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.239
Listen, I'm glad you came in.

35:56.364 --> 35:57.198
She's been down for an hour.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.283
I have an errand to run.

35:58.408 --> 36:00.201
So I'll be back in a little bit.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.202
And I'll get rid of all this.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.620
 OK, Lisa.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.664
But what about the
gifts for your staff?

36:04.789 --> 36:07.834
I just-- I have just far
too much business to do.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.628
And so I'm throwing the
towel in on the wreaths.

36:10.754 --> 36:11.504
It was stupid.

36:11.629 --> 36:12.881
 About yesterday, I--

36:13.006 --> 36:13.965
 No, no.

36:14.090 --> 36:14.966
I'm sorry.

36:15.091 --> 36:16.051
I overstepped.

36:16.176 --> 36:17.177
And I should have asked first.

36:17.302 --> 36:18.386
And-- but the room
is cleared out.

36:18.511 --> 36:19.512
And, um-- it's all yours again.

36:19.637 --> 36:20.221
 No.

36:20.347 --> 36:21.723
I feel awful.

36:21.848 --> 36:22.724
I overreacted.

36:22.849 --> 36:23.683
You do so much for us.

36:23.808 --> 36:25.393
And I'm sorry.

36:25.518 --> 36:27.062
I don't want you to have
to give up on your wreaths.

36:27.187 --> 36:28.146
 You know what?

36:28.271 --> 36:29.314
Believe me, it's for the best.

36:29.439 --> 36:30.231
And it has nothing
to do with you.

36:30.357 --> 36:31.816
- You're sure?
- Yes.

36:31.941 --> 36:34.235
And I don't have a creative
bone in my body, clearly.

36:34.361 --> 36:35.737
So I don't know
what I was thinking.

36:35.862 --> 36:39.324
[music playing]

36:46.456 --> 36:48.041
MITCH CUTTY: Whoa.

36:48.166 --> 36:51.670
So I'll ride up a little bit
later and check on that calf

36:51.795 --> 36:54.130
after I get home and
get a bit of shut eye,

36:54.255 --> 36:56.841
and I take a nice,
long, hot shower.

36:56.966 --> 36:58.802
You know, I don't know which
one is going to come first.

36:58.927 --> 37:02.597
JACK BARTLETT: I'm pretty
sure I could eat for three.

37:02.722 --> 37:04.557
You know, Stumpy's a lucky guy.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.059
You did a hell of a job.

37:06.184 --> 37:08.478
MITCH CUTTY: Well,
I mean, it felt

37:08.603 --> 37:12.232
pretty great to see that
calf getting a second chance.

37:12.357 --> 37:15.485
JACK BARTLETT: You know, I'd
say what happened back there

37:15.610 --> 37:18.113
pretty much sums things up.

37:18.238 --> 37:19.656
MITCH CUTTY: What do you mean?

37:19.781 --> 37:22.075
JACK BARTLETT: That calf
got his second chance

37:22.200 --> 37:23.368
because he earned it.

37:23.493 --> 37:24.285
MITCH CUTTY: Yeah.

37:24.411 --> 37:25.453
He hung in there.

37:25.578 --> 37:28.081
JACK BARTLETT: And so did you.

37:28.206 --> 37:32.293
Good things happen when
you refuse to quit.

37:32.419 --> 37:37.257
The trick is, you got to hang in
there so you can make the most

37:37.382 --> 37:39.134
of whatever comes your way.

37:39.259 --> 37:42.721
[music playing]

37:50.437 --> 37:53.440
 Oh, it's you.

37:53.565 --> 37:54.858
You had quite the adventure.

37:54.983 --> 37:56.651
 Yes, I did.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.945
 Did you see Phoenix out there?

37:59.070 --> 38:00.613
 Yeah.

38:00.739 --> 38:03.450
He looks real good, considering
what he's been through.

38:03.575 --> 38:05.118
Georgie did an amazing job.

38:05.243 --> 38:06.411
She stayed up with
him all night.

38:06.536 --> 38:08.997
 Well, good for her.

38:09.122 --> 38:11.124
 Grandpa, can I talk
to you about something?

38:11.249 --> 38:12.500
 OK.

38:12.625 --> 38:13.960
AMY FLEMING: It's about my room.

38:16.796 --> 38:18.798
Lisa told you.

38:18.923 --> 38:20.175
 Yeah.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.470
She-- she feels real bad
about that whole thing, Amy.

38:23.595 --> 38:25.680
AMY FLEMING: I
have to admit, I--

38:25.805 --> 38:27.474
I didn't handle it very well.

38:27.599 --> 38:30.310
But it really bothered
me going in there,

38:30.435 --> 38:32.854
seeing her just taking over.

38:32.979 --> 38:35.273
 Well, you didn't
expect it, I guess.

38:35.398 --> 38:36.566
AMY FLEMING: Yeah.

38:36.691 --> 38:41.363
 Was there more
to it than that?

38:41.488 --> 38:44.949
 I love the piece of
land that you gave us.

38:45.075 --> 38:46.910
I do.

38:47.035 --> 38:53.875
But I can't help but feel
like I'm being pushed away.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.044
It was pretty presumptuous
of Lisa to just go in there

38:56.169 --> 38:57.337
and take over.

38:57.462 --> 38:58.463
I mean, she didn't
even think to ask!

38:58.588 --> 39:01.132
 But that was my fault. I--

39:01.257 --> 39:03.677
I might have encouraged her.

39:03.802 --> 39:07.347
 I know that I live
in the loft now.

39:07.472 --> 39:10.100
I still think of
this as my home.

39:10.225 --> 39:11.976
You know, that's my room.

39:12.102 --> 39:17.691
And I guess I always
thought that when

39:17.816 --> 39:22.904
we did need more space,
we'd just move back in here.

39:26.074 --> 39:31.746
 Amy, you and your family,
you can live wherever you

39:31.871 --> 39:34.582
want for as long as you want.

39:34.708 --> 39:35.792
This is your home.

39:35.917 --> 39:39.754
It always will be your home.

39:39.879 --> 39:43.091
That piece of ground I want
you guys to have, it's--

39:43.216 --> 39:48.638
it's not about pushing you away,
or putting distance between us,

39:48.763 --> 39:51.224
or wanting to change your
room into something else.

39:51.349 --> 39:55.895
That was meant for you and your
family to have a place to grow.

39:58.606 --> 40:05.280
But if that happens inside these
walls, that's beautiful. too.

40:05.405 --> 40:06.698
 Thanks, Grandpa.

40:10.827 --> 40:14.581
And Lisa does need a
space of her own too.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.291
 Yes, she does.

 Hey, Peyton.

40:27.093 --> 40:28.219
 Hey, I heard
about the good news.

40:28.345 --> 40:29.429
 Oh, yeah.

40:29.554 --> 40:30.388
I've got a lot of
people to thank.

40:30.513 --> 40:31.848
 Yeah.

40:31.973 --> 40:32.807
Um-- I was just calling
to make sure that you

40:32.932 --> 40:33.558
hadn't gone on the gossip site.

40:33.683 --> 40:34.392
 No, I haven't.

40:34.517 --> 40:35.310
 Good.

40:35.435 --> 40:37.437
So don't, OK?

40:37.562 --> 40:38.813
 Why?

40:38.938 --> 40:39.981
What's on there?

40:40.106 --> 40:41.733
 Mean comments--
just a bunch of lies.

40:41.858 --> 40:44.110
Don't even worry about it.

40:44.235 --> 40:45.653
Look I got to wrap it.
I'll call you later, OK?

40:45.779 --> 40:47.489
 OK.

treated like that."

41:07.133 --> 41:09.636
 "That yokel is totally
out of her league."

41:09.761 --> 41:11.596
 "Georgie's the worst.

41:11.721 --> 41:13.056
She'd even hurt
her horse to win."

41:13.181 --> 41:14.724
 "Go away.

41:14.849 --> 41:16.851
Nobody likes you, Georgie.

41:16.976 --> 41:18.520
Just go away."

41:23.358 --> 41:26.444
 There will always
be a piece of property

41:26.569 --> 41:29.364
here for your girls, Lou.

41:29.489 --> 41:30.365
That's right.

41:30.490 --> 41:32.867
You never know.

41:32.992 --> 41:33.576
Yeah.

41:33.702 --> 41:34.828
OK, honey.

41:34.953 --> 41:35.829
Bye-bye.

41:35.954 --> 41:37.330
 What did she
think of the idea?

41:37.455 --> 41:39.416
 Well, she liked it.

41:39.541 --> 41:42.877
She thinks that spot that
overlooks the south coulee

41:43.003 --> 41:44.254
would be perfect for the girls--

41:44.379 --> 41:45.213
 Oh, good.

41:45.338 --> 41:46.047
 --one day anyway.

41:46.172 --> 41:48.216
 Good.

41:48.341 --> 41:49.384
What's going on in here?

41:49.509 --> 41:53.013
 I'll show you.

41:53.138 --> 41:54.681
 What?

41:54.806 --> 41:57.017
 What do you think?

41:57.142 --> 41:58.560
I mean-- did you
do that yourself?

41:58.685 --> 41:59.769
That's so good!

41:59.894 --> 42:01.187
 Grandpa helped,
believe it or not.

42:01.312 --> 42:02.147
 Yes, I did.
I did.

42:02.272 --> 42:03.231
 You did?

42:03.356 --> 42:04.774
 And I know it's not perfect.

42:04.899 --> 42:05.692
But it's just the first one.

42:05.817 --> 42:06.568
So we'll get better.

42:06.693 --> 42:07.986
 It's so good.

42:08.111 --> 42:09.362
I love it!

42:09.487 --> 42:11.072
 We've got a bit of an
assembly line going here.

42:11.197 --> 42:12.282
 Yeah.

42:12.407 --> 42:13.867
We thought that we
would tackle this stuff.

42:13.992 --> 42:17.328
 While you get
down to business.

42:17.454 --> 42:20.915
 And I am happy for you to
use my room for your office

42:21.041 --> 42:23.585
or whatever for as
long as you like.

42:23.710 --> 42:24.878
 Well, what about Lyndy?

42:25.003 --> 42:26.629
 She can Katie's room.

42:26.755 --> 42:28.423
JACK BARTLETT: So
what do you think?

42:28.548 --> 42:30.675
 I'm-- I-- I--

42:30.800 --> 42:32.010
am really grateful.

42:32.135 --> 42:32.844
Thank you.

42:32.969 --> 42:34.429
Thank you.

42:34.554 --> 42:38.183
And listen, if you want your
room back, just say the word--

42:38.308 --> 42:39.059
honestly.

42:39.184 --> 42:39.851
 OK.

42:39.976 --> 42:41.686
 You know what, guys?

42:41.811 --> 42:43.146
These are kind of great.

42:43.271 --> 42:44.272
You know, if you made a
few extra ones we could

42:44.397 --> 42:45.273
sell them at the winter fair.

42:45.398 --> 42:46.232
 Oh--

42:46.358 --> 42:47.442
 Absolutely not.

42:47.567 --> 42:48.360
 Just an idea.

42:48.485 --> 42:49.277
AMY FLEMING: Nope.

42:49.402 --> 42:50.945
Not happening.

42:51.071 --> 42:54.616
[music - michael logen, "here"]

42:59.287 --> 43:04.668
MICHAEL LOGEN: (SINGING) We
can't see what comes next.

43:04.793 --> 43:09.089
We just take it
breath by breath.

43:09.214 --> 43:18.014
The one thing you can know
for sure, know for sure.

43:18.139 --> 43:27.524
I'll be here when the skies go
dark to hide you from the rain.

43:27.649 --> 43:37.033
When your world seems to fall
apart, I'll still be here.

43:37.158 --> 43:46.918
And I'll be here when you reach
for me, when you call my name.

43:47.043 --> 43:51.131
Run to me when you fall apart.

43:51.256 --> 43:56.302
And I will be here.

43:56.428 --> 44:01.307
Yes, I will be here.

44:01.433 --> 44:05.103
I'll still be here.
