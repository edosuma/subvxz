00:23.256 --> 00:25.525
>> THANK YOU ALL.
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR COMING

00:25.525 --> 00:28.161
AND ANSWERING YOUR NATION'S CALL
IN A TIME OF NEED.
>> OH, YEAH, SURE.

00:28.161 --> 00:33.800
>> NO PROB.
>> OUR SCHEDULES ARE ACTUALLY
SUPER FLEXIBLE.

00:33.800 --> 00:43.343
>> AND WE LOVE WHITE HOUSE.
* JASON DERULO *
>> ALSO, I WANT TO THANK MY

00:43.343 --> 00:45.945
PRESS SECRETARY JEN PSAKI FOR
HAVING THE VISION TO SET THIS
UP.

00:45.945 --> 00:57.157
>> I SUGGESTED IT AS A JOKE, AND
THEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
>> THIS IS TOUGH ON ME BECAUSE

00:57.157 --> 01:01.895
I'M THE LANDLINE OF PRESIDENTS.
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU.
I UNDERSTAND PUTIN.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.799
I UNDERSTAND WAR.
BUT THERE'S ONE THING I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

01:05.799 --> 01:12.972
THAT'S COMPUTER.
>> HE MEANS TECHNOLOGY BUT HE
SAYS COMPUTER.

01:12.972 --> 01:26.886
>> COMPUTERS ARE ALWAYS VERY
MEAN TO ME.
COMPUTER SAY, DID YOU MEAN

01:26.886 --> 01:29.789
MAGENTA?"
>> THE POINT IS WE NEED FRESH
IDEAS FROM YOU GUYS ABOUT HOW WE

01:29.789 --> 01:31.458
CAN WIN THE INFORMATION WAR ON
SOCIAL MEDIA.
YES, YOU.

01:31.458 --> 01:36.563
>> HEY, GUYS.
I'M AN ACTRESS FROM THE CW.
>> GREAT, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:36.563 --> 01:43.336
>> ACTRESS FROM THE CW.
AND WHILE PUTIN MAY HAVE TANKS
AND BOMBS, THERE'S SOMETHING

01:43.336 --> 01:46.406
EVEN MORE POWERFUL WE CAN ATTACK
HIM WITH.
POEMS.

01:46.406 --> 01:51.644
>> OH, NO, IT'S THAT GIRL.
**
>> DEAR VLADAMIR PUTIN, IF I WAS

01:51.644 --> 02:02.155
YOUR MOTHER, I WOULD LOVE YOU
MORE.
IF I WAS YOUR WIFE, I WOULD HAVE

02:02.155 --> 02:16.736
BEEN SO, SO, SO MAD AT YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.772
DO YOU HAVE ANY ACTUAL USEFUL
SUGGESTIONS?
>> OH, SURE.

02:18.772 --> 02:24.544
HERE ARE FIVE WAYS TO STOP THE
WAR IN UKRAINE.
>> WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

02:24.544 --> 02:32.886
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
YOU SEE ANYTHING?
>> I THINK SHE'S EXPECTING TECH

02:32.886 --> 02:36.322
TO SHOW UP.
>> OKAY.
HEY, YOU.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.759
WHAT'S YOUR THING?
>> OH, ME?
LET'S JUST SAY I DO RAPS AND

02:39.759 --> 02:43.563
PRANKS.
MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF MY SQUAD,
THE BOO-BOO BOYS?

02:43.563 --> 02:47.000
>> I THINK YOU KNOW THE
PRESIDENT HAS NEVER HEARD OF THE
BOO-BOO BOYS.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.140
>> WAIT A SECOND.
THE BOO-BOO BOYS?
DON'T YOU LIVE IN THE YEESH

02:54.140 --> 02:59.713
HOUSE WITH ONE NET KEVIN AND
DUMBASS LARRY?
>> OH-OH, WE GOT A BOO-BOO HEAD!

02:59.713 --> 03:07.153
>> Y'ALL, ONE TIME THEY PRANKED
A WOMAN DOWN FIVE FLIGHTS OF
STAIRS, IT WAS HILARIOUS.

03:07.153 --> 03:09.823
>> YEAH, AND THEN WE DID A RAP
ABOUT THE AMBULANCE THAT CAME.
>> WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN

03:09.823 --> 03:13.760
AMAZING HOBBY.
>> WE MADE $13 MILLION LAST
YEAR.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.596
>> GOD, I HATE THIS WORLD.
AND DID YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR HOW
TO DEFEAT PUTIN?

03:16.596 --> 03:18.365
>> OH, YEAH, I'M COOKING
SOMETHING UP.
>> IS IT PUSHING HIM DOWN A

03:18.365 --> 03:20.834
FLIGHT OF STAIRS?
>> IT IS.
>> GREAT.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.504
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
* JASON DERULO *

03:24.504 --> 03:30.710
>> YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW THAT'S
YOUR NAME, BUT WHAT DO YOU DO?
* JASON DERULO *

03:30.710 --> 03:36.683
>> I'M SKIPPING YOU, YOU'RE
SKIPPED.
* JASON DER RULE LA *

03:36.683 --> 03:39.753
>> HOW ABOUT YOU, LITTLE GIRL?
GOD, LOOK, YOU'RE INCREDIBLY
CUTE.

03:39.753 --> 03:43.223
>> THANKS.
THANK YOU.
I DO SILLY ANIMAL MAKEUP FOR

03:43.223 --> 03:47.594
KIDS.
>> WELL, THAT'S ADORABLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO

03:47.594 --> 03:59.706
WIN THIS WAR?
>> OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE STARTED
BY YOUR SON, HUNTER BIDEN.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.375
WHEN HE AND HIS PALS AT
BURISMA -- WHERE'S THE LAPTOP,
IS IT IN THIS ROOM?

04:02.375 --> 04:19.092
>> OKAY, THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.
WHAT ABOUT THIS RANDOM
MIDDLE-AGED GUY?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.628
>> HELLO.
MY NAME IS CHARLES F. D'AMELIO.
I'M A ROOFER FROM PITTSBURGH.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.831
>> OKAY.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

04:24.831 --> 04:31.438
I SUSPECT MAYBE THAT YOU HAVE
CONFUSED ME FOR CHARLI D'AMELIO,
THE 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL WITH

04:31.438 --> 04:39.412
130 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON TIKTOK.
>> SOUNDS RIGHT, YEAH.
>> SO I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M JUST

04:39.412 --> 04:45.151
GOING TO HEAD OUT.
BUT FIRST, DO Y'ALL HAPPEN TO
HAVE ONE OF THOSE COVID STIMMY

04:45.151 --> 04:48.455
CHECKS AROUND, BY ANY CHANCE?
>> AFRAID NOT.
>> WE DON'T, I'M SO SORRY.

04:48.455 --> 04:53.093
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK WITH THE
WORLD WAR.
NOT WHAT YOU CARE WHAT A ROOFER

04:53.093 --> 04:58.131
THINKS ABOUT PUTIN, BUT MAYBE
YOU SHOULD PUT SOMEONE UP ON A
ROOF AND -- BAM BAM BAM.

04:58.131 --> 05:04.938
Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD ONE.
>> GREAT.
IT'S DOWN TO YOU.

05:04.938 --> 05:11.411
WHAT DO YOU DO?
>> WHO, ME?
OH, I JUST GO UP BEHIND PEOPLE

05:11.411 --> 05:17.050
ON THE STREET WITH THIS WEIRD
PIPE AND I GO -- OONGYANGYO!
>> WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT

05:17.050 --> 05:25.258
UKRAINE?
>> I WOULD GO UP BEHIND THE
RUSSIAN TANKS AND GO OONGYANGYO.

05:25.258 --> 05:31.231
>> AND HOW DID YOU GET HERE
TODAY?
>> YOU FLEW ME FIRST CLASS FROM

05:31.231 --> 05:44.377
CALIFORNIA, AND ON THE PLANE,I
WENT UP THERE TO THE PILOT AND I
SAID, "OONGYANGYO."

05:44.377 --> 05:50.784
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY BEST PLAN
I'VE HEARD SO FAR.
>> WHOA!

05:50.784 --> 05:54.120
HEY, HEY, SORRY I'M LATE, GUYS.
SECURITY WAS GIVING ME A HARD
TIME.

05:54.120 --> 05:59.292
>> OKAY, THIS IS AWESOME.
WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?
>> I DO A PUNCH OF INSANE TRICKS

05:59.292 --> 06:03.596
USING A TOILET PLUNGER STUCK TO
MY NIPPLES.
I'M ONE OF THE FAMOUS PEOPLE ON

06:03.596 --> 06:09.302
TIKTOK, IT'S LIKE ME AND
REESE WITHERSPOON.
>> OKAY, WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY

06:09.302 --> 06:13.373
ABOUT TO WRAP THIS MEETING UP
BECAUSE IT WAS CLEARLY A BAD
IDEA.

06:13.373 --> 06:18.611
>> HEY, DON'T DO THAT.
**
DON'T JUST TEAR THE PLUNGER OFF

06:18.611 --> 06:22.282
THE NIPPLE LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW, THE IDEA OF ASKING
TIKTOK STARS HOW TO FIGHT RUSSIA

06:22.282 --> 06:24.551
MIGHT SOUND LIKE A JOKE, BUT
REMEMBER, THEY SAID THE SAME
THING ABOUT THE RADIO IN WORLD

06:24.551 --> 06:28.221
WAR II.
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE
IMPORTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND

06:28.221 --> 06:32.559
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE
IMPORTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND
YOUNG PEOPLE.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.267
GIMMICKS MAY HAVE MORE POWER AND
INFLUENCE THAN THE "NIGHTLY
NEWS."

06:45.372 --> 06:49.809
THAT WAS TRULY INSPIRING, YOUNG
MAN.
>> OH, I'M 55.

06:49.809 --> 06:53.980
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M
GOING TO GO MOVE THIS PLUNGER TO
MY CROTCH, ATTACH A KNIFE TO THE

06:53.980 --> 06:58.985
END, AND TRY TO SLICE AN APPLE
IN HALF.
GOD BLESS AMERICA!

06:58.985 --> 07:02.822
GOD BLESS AMERICA!
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

09:04.811 --> 09:07.681
MUSICAL GUEST, ROSALIA

09:07.681 --> 09:09.282
MUSICAL GUEST, ROSALIA
AND YOUR HOST, ZOE KRAVITZ!

09:34.174 --> 09:38.578
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT IS SO FANTASTIC TO BE HERE.

09:38.578 --> 09:49.689
I'M YOUR HOST, ZOE KRAVITZ.
[ APPLAUSE ]
I CURRENTLY HAVE A NEW MOVIE OUT

09:49.689 --> 09:50.156
[ APPLAUSE ]
I CURRENTLY HAVE A NEW MOVIE OUT
CALLED "THE BATMAN."

09:58.098 --> 10:01.234
TO PREPARE FOR THE ROLE, I
WATCHED THE MOVIE MUSICAL "CATS"
EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR.

10:01.234 --> 10:06.439
WHICH IS ACTUALLY HOW I HEARD
JOAQUIN PHOENIX PREPARED TO PLAY
THE JOKER.

10:06.439 --> 10:12.712
>> SOMEONE HERE TALKING ABOUT
"CATS?"
>> I WAS, YEAH.

10:12.712 --> 10:18.018
I WAS JUST DOING THE MONOLOGUE.
YOU'RE ALSO CATWOMAN?
>> YES.

10:18.018 --> 10:22.789
I'M CATWOMAN FROM THE '90S.
THE ONE WITH THE WHIP.
YOU KNOW.

10:22.789 --> 10:29.596
LIKE CATS HAVE.
SO YOU'RE PART OF A PROUD
LINEAGE OF CATWOMEN, EACH WITH

10:29.596 --> 10:35.735
OUR OWN ORIGIN STORIES.
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW MINE?
>> YEAH, SURE, WHAT'S YOURS?

10:35.735 --> 10:41.207
>> I FELL OUT OF A WINDOW INTO A
PILE OF CATS.
THEY LICKED ME BACK TO LIFE, AND

10:41.207 --> 10:48.748
NOW IT'S JUST LIKE SANDY FROM A
PORNO VERSION OF "GREASE."
IT'S STILL CALLED "GREASE."

10:48.748 --> 10:53.186
>> COOL.
WELL -- THANK YOU, IT'S REALLY
GREAT TO HAVE A FELLOW CATWOMAN

10:53.186 --> 10:56.790
SUPPORT.
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK TO --
>> HANG ON, WE MUST FIRE UP THE

10:56.790 --> 11:01.194
CAT SIGNAL.
>> I'M SORRY, CAT SIGNAL?
>> YEAH, FOR ANY TIME YOU NEED A

11:01.194 --> 11:09.302
CATWOMAN.
BEHOLD.
>> OH, MY GOD!

11:09.302 --> 11:15.842
I LOVE THAT.
IT'S A NOBLE CAT READY TO POUNCE
OFF THE LEDGE.

11:15.842 --> 11:19.446
>> OR MAYBE IT'S JUST DOING ITS
BIZ IN THE LITTER BOX.
>> I SAW THE SIGNAL, IS SOMEONE

11:19.446 --> 11:23.983
>> I SAW THE SIGNAL, IS SOMEONE
IN DANGER?
[ APPLAUSE ]

11:26.486 --> 11:31.991
>> INDUBITABLY.
I WAS THE FIRST BLACK CATWOMAN.
>> RIGHT, YES, OF COURSE,

11:31.991 --> 11:36.296
EARTHA KITT FROM THE 1960S TV
VERSION.
>> YEAH, PEOPLE CALLED IT CAMPY,

11:36.296 --> 11:43.003
TURNS OUT IT WAS SUPER GAY.
BE GRATEFUL YOUR OUTFIT ISN'T
LATEX BECAUSE THIS IS HOW I

11:43.003 --> 11:47.440
BE GRATEFUL YOUR OUTFIT ISN'T
LATEX BECAUSE THIS IS HOW I
SNEAK UP ON BAD GUYS.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.013
NICE HAVING ALL THIS CATWOMAN
ENERGY UP HERE, BUT I REALLY
SHOULD GET BACK TO THE

11:53.013 --> 11:55.882
MONOLOGUE.
SO CAN WE TURN OFF THE CAT
SIGNAL BEFORE WE --

11:55.882 --> 12:03.456
>> BEFORE ME?
>> ANOTHER CATWOMAN?
>> YEAH.

12:03.456 --> 12:16.403
YEAH, I'M MORE OF A CAT LADY, I
GUESS.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.973
SORRY CAT, AND WE'RE HERE TO
MEET ROSALIA.
DO YOU TAKE ME TO HER OR HOW

12:19.973 --> 12:22.475
DOES THAT WORK?
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT
RIGHT NOW, I KIND OF HAVE TO

12:22.475 --> 12:24.978
HOST THE SHOW, SO --
>> OH, YEAH.
I GET IT.

12:24.978 --> 12:28.081
YOU KNOW, I HOSTED THE SHOW
DOZENS OF TIMES.
IN MY MIND.

12:28.081 --> 12:33.086
WHERE IT'S CALLED "SATURDAY
NIGHT CATS."
>> NOT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.655
NIGHT CATS."
>> NOT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"?
>> DANG IT.

12:40.627 --> 12:46.399
MEET SO MANY CAT -- PEOPLE.
AND NOT THAT I'M NOT LOVING IT,
BUT MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH, SO

12:46.399 --> 12:50.236
LET'S JUST --
>> EVEN IF THE NEXT ONE WAS DOJA
CAT?

12:50.236 --> 12:56.242
>> OH, MY GOD, IS SHE HERE?
>> NO, BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET
ME.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.211
IT IS I, KAT WILLIAMS!
>> COME ON.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A WOMAN.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.781
>> I AM A LOVER OF WOMEN, MEOW!
AND IF I WANTED TO MEET ROSALIA,
HOW WOULD I DO THAT?

13:01.781 --> 13:05.452
>> SERIOUSLY, IS THERE AN OFF
BUTTON SOMEWHERE?
>> THE CAT SIGNAL BROUGHT US ALL

13:05.452 --> 13:05.752
BUTTON SOMEWHERE?
>> THE CAT SIGNAL BROUGHT US ALL
TOGETHER.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.894
CAN GET.
NOW LET'S GO FIGHT SOME CRIME,
YES!

13:14.894 --> 13:16.463
NOW LET'S GO FIGHT SOME CRIME,
YES!
>> OKAY.

13:22.135 --> 13:26.306
BEEN TRYING TO SAY.
WHICH IS, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

13:26.306 --> 13:33.613
ROSALIA IS HERE.
STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK!

13:42.822 --> 13:45.625
>>> I ALWAYS GOT THE SENSE THAT
MATT LOOKED DOWN ON ME, BUT
THAT'S ONLY 'CAUSE HE'S TWO

13:45.625 --> 13:47.861
INCHES TALLER.
[ LAUGHTER ]
NO, BUT I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU,

13:47.861 --> 13:53.833
BUDDY, I LOVE YOU, BRO.
TO MATT AND TANYA, CHEERS!
>> OKAY.

13:53.833 --> 13:59.372
YES, HOW ABOUT A HAND FOR MATT'S
BEST MAN, NATE!
ALL RIGHT!

13:59.372 --> 14:02.275
[ APPLAUSE ]
YAY.
I'M SO SORRY I'M CHEWING, THAT

14:02.275 --> 14:09.683
WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLY SHORT
SPEECH.
IT OPENED WITH THAT "LOOKED DOWN

14:09.683 --> 14:12.385
ON ME" JOKE, AND, IT JUST KIND
OF ENDED A FEW SENTENCES LATER.
SO I WAS SURE IT WOULD BE

14:12.385 --> 14:16.890
LONGER, WHICH IS WHY I TOOK A
BITE OF FOOD, BUT I WAS WRONG.
BUT STILL, A VERY NICE SPEECH

14:16.890 --> 14:20.193
FROM NATE.
OKAY.
NOW LET'S HEAR FROM THE MAID OF

14:20.193 --> 14:24.197
HONOR.
IT'S TANYA'S BEST FRIEND, SARAH,
COME ON UP, SARAH!

14:24.197 --> 14:29.869
>> YEAH!
[ APPLAUSE ]
>> HI, EVERYONE.

14:29.869 --> 14:35.709
I'M SARAH.
UM, MATT, LET ME JUST TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

14:35.709 --> 14:40.747
YOU'RE A REALLY LUCKY GUY.
BECAUSE TANYA IS THE BEST GIRL
IN THE WORLD.

14:40.747 --> 14:45.085
>> AW.
>> I MEAN, THIS GIRL IS LIKE --
>> YES, SHE IS.

14:45.085 --> 14:49.989
>> SHE'S LIKE A SISTER TO ME.
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'VE BOTH
SEEN MY DAD NAKED.

14:49.989 --> 14:53.093
[ LAUGHTER ]
>> OKAY.
>> SHE'S ALWAYS HAD MY BACK.

14:53.093 --> 14:58.665
EVEN WHEN NOBODY ELSE AGREED
WITH ME, SHE ALWAYS SAID,
"SARAH, IF YOU SAY YOU'RE SOBER

14:58.665 --> 15:02.535
ENOUGH TO DRIVE THEN I BELIEVE
YOU."
AND THAT MEANT THE WORLD TO ME,

15:02.535 --> 15:07.374
GIRLIE.
AND WHEN I STUMBLE, WHEN I MAKE
A MISTAKE, SHE'D NEVER MAKE ME

15:07.374 --> 15:11.044
FEEL BAD.
SHE'D SAY, "GIRLIE, DON'T BEAT
YOURSELF UP, NOBODY KNEW THAT

15:11.044 --> 15:18.151
THING WAS LOADED."
>> DID SHE SHOOT SOMEONE?
>> BABE, I'M TRYING TO LISTEN.

15:18.151 --> 15:24.491
>> AND WHEN SHE'S GOING THROUGH
A TOUGH TIME HERSELF, SHE
DOESN'T COMPLAIN, SHE DANCES.

15:24.491 --> 15:30.897
PROFESSIONALLY.
>> WHAT KIND OF DANCING?
>> BABE?

15:30.897 --> 15:37.303
>> LIKE, SHE'S NOT PERFECT.
>> NO WAY.
>> WHAT KIND OF DANCING?

15:37.303 --> 15:43.777
>> SHE HAS BEEN A BIT OF A
BRIDEZILLA, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
SHE ATTACKED A LOT OF JAPANESE

15:43.777 --> 15:54.220
PEOPLE.
I AM IN AWE OF HER.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU,

15:54.220 --> 15:56.756
BUT IF MY LAST 15 BOYFRIENDS
KILLED THEMSELVES, I'D GIVE UP
ON ROMANCE.

15:56.756 --> 16:01.428
BUT NOT TANYA.
>> SHE'S -- SHE'S JOKING, RIGHT?
>> 'CAUSE SHE BELIEVES IN LOVE.

16:01.428 --> 16:05.632
WHEN I STARTED DATING MY
NOW-HUSBAND, SHE WAS SO HAPPY
FOR ME.

16:05.632 --> 16:10.103
EVERYONE ELSE SAID, "YOU'RE A
MONSTER."
BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY, GIRLIE?

16:10.103 --> 16:20.046
>> "YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER, YOU'RE
JUST HIS MATH TEACHER."
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

16:20.046 --> 16:25.885
LOVE IS LOVE, RIGHT, BABY?
>> NO DOUBT.
>> BUT MOST OF ALL, TANYA IS

16:25.885 --> 16:28.321
BRAVE.
GIRLIE, I KNOW YOU REMEMBER
THIS.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.624
WE WERE AT A PROTEST FIGHTING
FOR JUSTICE.
AND YOU GOT RIGHT IN THAT COP'S

16:31.624 --> 16:35.628
FACE.
NO FEAR AT ALL.
AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU

16:35.628 --> 16:42.068
SAID?
>> "I'M STORMING THE CAPITOL AND
I'M GOING TO KILL MIKE PENCE."

16:42.068 --> 16:54.080
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AND MATT, YOU MAKE HER SO HAPPY.
I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS YOU,

16:54.080 --> 17:00.620
BUT WHEN YOU GUYS FIRST GOT
TOGETHER, ME AND TONIA ARE
HAVING SOME GIRL TALK AND I

17:00.620 --> 17:03.556
SAID, YOU KNOW, "HOW'S THE
CHEMISTRY IN THE BEDROOM?"
>> HA, NO, HERE WE GO.

17:03.556 --> 17:07.260
>> AND SHE SAID, "HE'S TRYING
HIS BEST."
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES MATT

17:07.260 --> 17:10.030
DIFFERENT FROM THE HUNDREDS AND
HUNDREDS OF OTHER GUYS THAT
SHE'S DRAGGED HOME OVER THE

17:10.030 --> 17:13.299
YEARS.
>> HUNDREDS?
>> BABY.

17:13.299 --> 17:18.038
>> AND SURE, MAYBE HE'S NOT
FAMOUS LIKE STEVE-O FROM
"JACKASS," OR "WEE MAN" FROM

17:18.038 --> 17:24.678
"JACKASS."
MAYBE HE'S NOT MYSTERIOUS, LIKE
BAM MARGERA FROM "JACKASS."

17:24.678 --> 17:29.849
BUT HE PUT IN THE WORK.
LIKE JOHNNY KNOXVILLE, FROM
"JACKASS."

17:29.849 --> 17:33.386
>> SO YOU JUST GOT WITH THE
WHOLE "JACKASS" GANG, THEN?
>> HEY HONEY.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.656
I LISTENED TO YOUR FRIEND'S
SPEECH, OKAY?
COME ON.

17:36.656 --> 17:41.561
>> SHE LOVED YOU RIGHT AWAY,
