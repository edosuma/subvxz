WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:02.708
Previously on Killjoys...

00:03.045 --> 00:05.787
I've ran every possible variable,
and they all end like this.

00:05.798 --> 00:06.753
Then what are we missing?

00:07.091 --> 00:08.046
We got 34 Black Root ships,

00:08.217 --> 00:09.627
1,200 Ferran mercenaries, Qreshi money,

00:09.886 --> 00:12.047
and an ass-load of angry
Killjoys out for revenge.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.885
And the Hullen have biology, Aneela,

00:13.890 --> 00:16.302
and a sweat-ass armarda!
Head-to-head we are toast!

00:16.559 --> 00:18.550
You put something
in me, Gander.

00:18.853 --> 00:21.469
So now, I'M putting something in you.

00:21.814 --> 00:24.681
Round up all the other Free Hullen.
Transfuse them all.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.690
I've been wandering
around your memeries.

00:26.986 --> 00:28.817
Some of them are missing.
Why is that?

00:28.988 --> 00:30.774
You're not Khlyen.
I know, who you are!

00:31.240 --> 00:35.199
I've figured out a way to
destroy Dutch and the Lady too.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.578
- I need to know what's really inside me.
- The moment of truth.

00:39.916 --> 00:42.032
- It's D'Av's baby.
- We're familiy now.

00:42.335 --> 00:45.873
- You got something?
- Complete disruption. Navs, comms,

00:45.880 --> 00:47.416
weapon systems.
All fritzed.

00:47.632 --> 00:50.339
Transmit this on a mass scale,
we can fry them all mid-flight.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.591
- If you kill Aneela...
- I die too!

00:55.306 --> 00:57.547
- You came. - Well,
l have a lot to reckon with.

01:45.565 --> 01:47.476
You are Yalena.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.813
The universe has a memory.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.528
That’s all time really is.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.157
Our whole life told in moments.

01:59.412 --> 02:01.243
The sweat and sour,

02:02.373 --> 02:04.785
the kisses and the scars.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.663
Our beginnings,

02:08.588 --> 02:10.078
and good-byes.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.548
all written down in time.

02:15.386 --> 02:16.671
Recorded,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.594
so the universe
will know we were here.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.549
So we won 't be forgotten.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.929
We are all made of memories.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.686
And this is howl
remember it ending.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.358
Oh, it's very... farmy.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.485
You have no idea
what this is, do you?

02:42.747 --> 02:45.864
No, but if you're about to suggest
a last little roll in the hay...

02:46.042 --> 02:47.373
It's for my brother.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.201
It's yours now, John,
or after the war, anyway.

02:50.421 --> 02:53.163
200 acres of
RAC-owned ranch land,

02:53.341 --> 02:55.172
little creek out back,
off the grid.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.587
- Don't even tell me that
there's goats! - Johnny...

02:58.179 --> 02:59.339
They're robot goats.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.140
Whoo! I'm a rancher!

03:06.562 --> 03:10.054
So you bought John his
future homestead as a gift for me.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.515
Nope, still don't get it.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.276
You know I don't
want you to face Aneela,

03:17.031 --> 03:19.989
and if it comes down to a kill-shot,
you know I don't want you to take it,

03:20.201 --> 03:22.032
- But, if you do--
- When I do.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.782
I want you to
have peace of mind.

03:26.666 --> 03:29.373
Whatever happens to you,
Johnny's going to be all right, Dutch.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.289
I'll make sure of it.

03:37.009 --> 03:39.045
He's not the only one I
worry about, you know?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.841
Yeah, yeah, he is.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.761
Okay, yeah, he is.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.847
Thanks for that,
most of all.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.099
You're welcome.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.023
Not a bad view at the
possible end of the world, huh?

04:00.783 --> 04:02.114
No, it's not.

04:07.707 --> 04:10.244
Hey, we knew this
couldn't last forever.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.333
John! Go time!

04:14.672 --> 04:17.254
Armada has officially
entered Quad space.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.043
We gotta go.
Is the Sonic ready?

04:19.218 --> 04:21.209
Yeah, just needs a systems check
once all the relays are online.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.427
She's here!

04:31.772 --> 04:33.228
Right on time.
Look at that!

04:33.399 --> 04:35.310
Delle Seyah finally told
the truth about something.

04:35.568 --> 04:37.149
Go, get to positions!

04:37.403 --> 04:38.939
We'll hold ground here.

04:41.907 --> 04:45.115
Let's move, people!
Perimeter sweep, starting now!

04:45.828 --> 04:47.409
All right, boys!

04:47.413 --> 04:49.404
Let's go see a
bitch about a war.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.991
Why is it just...
sitting there?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.204
Well, she'd better
goddamn blink first.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.824
Shit! That ship is big!

05:35.127 --> 05:37.869
I'm feeling kind of sweaty.
Anybody else feeling sweaty, like...

05:38.589 --> 05:39.624
in the mouth?

05:39.924 --> 05:42.540
- They say size doesn't matter.
- Nobody says that.

05:43.594 --> 05:46.631
- But I would not want to whip it
out in front of this beauty. - Good.

05:46.806 --> 05:49.343
Our plan only works if
they're the ones doing the whipping.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.007
Should we launch
some missiles?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.554
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
Let's throw rocks at big kids.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.311
We got to wait for them
to come into our trap.

05:56.732 --> 06:00.020
That's the whole point of keeping Delle
Seyah and my alien spawn baby as bait.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.272
What the hell are
they waiting for?

06:05.366 --> 06:07.357
Hey, is it war yet?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.196
- Almost.
- Cool!

06:10.996 --> 06:12.281
Got a sec?

06:13.666 --> 06:15.998
I did it! Locked and loaded.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.833
Awhole life in a single ring.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.753
It's called the Nebulizer.

06:21.090 --> 06:22.170
How does it work?

06:22.508 --> 06:25.170
Just a little pressure and...

06:31.475 --> 06:32.760
Where do I...

06:33.310 --> 06:35.687
- You know. - Oh, the
temple or the back of the skull.

06:35.855 --> 06:37.311
Jabber's choice.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.306
Thank you, Zeph.

06:42.194 --> 06:43.604
For everything.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.321
You're a really good person.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.366
I don't think you
get told that enough.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.410
Dutch, the RAC is hailing us.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.663
You've been requested
by medical bay.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.714
Take us in.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.967
Aneela's sending
you a message.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.554
His men found him
in the Necropolis.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.307
- Who else knows?
- Just us.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.017
- I'll tell D'Av and the others.
- Oh, no, later.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.683
It's a bad omen right before war.

07:23.903 --> 07:25.143
People would lose heart.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.394
Last thing Alvis would want.

07:27.907 --> 07:29.192
Are you sure?

07:30.075 --> 07:31.485
Tomorrow we can mourn.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.125
Today we fight.

07:45.925 --> 07:48.758
- Still no contact? - Not yet,
and no movement either.

07:48.761 --> 07:49.876
But we are ready for them.

07:49.887 --> 07:50.967
Status report.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.429
Scarbacks and Killjoys are at the relay
stations on Qresh, Westerley, and Arkyn.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.223
- Good!
- Ferrans are prepping the Sonic.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.258
Pree, how's the
signal strength test?

07:58.604 --> 07:59.684
Just ran it.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.475
She's not pretty,
but she definitely puts out.

08:04.360 --> 08:05.600
It's a good joke.

08:06.070 --> 08:07.560
Whatever. I don't
need your aproval.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.566
Hold tight and
wait for my order.

08:09.949 --> 08:11.189
You got it.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.692
Once the Sonic blasts the signal,
the relays will triangulate it,

08:14.954 --> 08:16.490
disabling every
ship in that kill zone.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.912
Except for ours, thanks
to John's modifications.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.831
What about my Cleansed pilots?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.707
Hang back and strafe
whatever ships make it through.

08:23.087 --> 08:26.170
We'll use that as a distraction to board
Aneela's ship with a small strike force.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.254
Not a bad plan.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.588
Is this a private party,
or are gingers welcome?

08:32.304 --> 08:33.510
What do you want, Turin?

08:33.514 --> 08:36.847
- Permission to return to active duty,
General. - Permission denied!

08:37.434 --> 08:38.423
With prejudice.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.142
You remember
prejudice, right?

08:40.312 --> 08:42.177
Wow, wordplay and muscles.

08:42.690 --> 08:43.975
Save some for the rest of us.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.726
Fancy's okay with it.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.399
It's war,
not prom.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.860
Sometimes you
need your enemies.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.453
This is a bit Déja-vu.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.536
I preferred it when l was
on that side of the cage,

09:05.754 --> 09:06.869
Care to role-play?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.962
Oh, I don't think you'll like
my role-play today.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.175
Put them on.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.010
You aren't actually
afraid of me now, are you?

09:16.265 --> 09:17.801
Nah, just the
bitch cooties.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.137
I said put them on!

09:22.479 --> 09:24.595
You've been keeping
very poor company.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.347
Aneela.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.558
Well, every proper
villain is someone else's hero.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.935
I guess she's mine.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.404
Does that bother you?

09:35.284 --> 09:36.649
That I'm so very fond of her?

09:36.827 --> 09:39.910
I don't care what you do
with your fossilized heart.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.199
Alvis is dead.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.323
Aneela's handiwork,
I presume?

09:44.626 --> 09:48.289
Maybe. His people did build an entire
religion out of calling her the devil.

09:48.464 --> 09:49.874
How would you feel?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.965
She's prettier
than you, you know?

09:54.344 --> 09:56.426
- Something in the eyes.
- What? Insanity?

09:56.847 --> 09:58.553
I came here to
ask you a question.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.887
and if you don't give me the right answer,
I'm gonna take you very far away from here

10:02.061 --> 10:03.722
and shoot you very hard.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.219
What is she waiting for?

10:05.481 --> 10:08.848
- What do you mean? - I mean,
we have our bait you and her spawn.

10:09.193 --> 10:12.856
Yet she's not sending her ships for your big,
sexy rescue. Why not?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.737
Maybe she's just not that into you.

10:16.492 --> 10:19.325
Maybe she's been
using you all this time.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.406
Like the needy
bitch that you are.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.744
Yo know what you are, Yala?

10:27.503 --> 10:29.039
Predictable!

11:06.542 --> 11:07.622
Oops!

11:07.918 --> 11:09.249
Busted!

11:09.878 --> 11:11.038
Ah, you know me.

11:11.255 --> 11:12.244
lcan't give up.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.960
l was just hoping there was
something special about this Dreadnaught

11:14.967 --> 11:17.253
that we could use since
Khlyen designed it to kill Aneela.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.129
Give!

11:22.933 --> 11:24.469
Okay.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.227
You know, half of myjob
is last-minute reprieves.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.732
I'm not going to stop trying to
save you just because you want me to.

11:35.445 --> 11:36.651
Deal?

11:38.115 --> 11:39.480
Deal!

11:44.705 --> 11:48.289
Finally! I have the patience of a
saint but the bladder of a breeder.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.835
You were five minutes
from being murder-boarded.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.001
Pick her up!

11:53.297 --> 11:54.537
I don't lift.

11:55.007 --> 11:58.215
Even if we all end in a blaze of glory,
I've got no regrets.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.630
This gig has never been boring.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.423
Neither have you.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.429
Come on! For old times sake.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.222
What was your favorite mission?

12:10.522 --> 12:12.558
—You first.
- Hm...

12:14.902 --> 12:18.895
Well, l was enjoying our Ketemi
gig naked ladies and a stolen hokk

12:19.072 --> 12:21.734
but that was also the first time
that Khlyen caught up with you, so...

12:23.619 --> 12:26.201
Sorry, I guess I should stick
to the happy memories, huh?

12:30.876 --> 12:32.912
You know the greatest
thing about best friends?

12:33.462 --> 12:35.578
What?

12:36.965 --> 12:39.217
They always know
who you really are.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.221
Hello, Aneela.
Nice try, bitch-face!

12:52.022 --> 12:53.933
Hello, Johnny favorite.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.690
Kendry told me about you.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.563
You shot her!

12:58.862 --> 13:05.734
l was gonna leave you for her,
but now you'll be - mine!

13:08.455 --> 13:10.161
- What is that?
- Just a tip.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.114
Would you like all of my decibels?

13:18.632 --> 13:21.169
John? How not all right are you?

13:21.385 --> 13:23.091
I need a numerical equivalence.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.592
- What is that? - Someone's trying to
start emergency lockdown on your ship.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.220
- You want to override?
- Lockdown on whose authority?

13:30.852 --> 13:32.137
Your brother's.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.018
Johnny? Do you copy?

13:34.231 --> 13:35.516
John is in distress.

13:35.816 --> 13:36.931
He's not responding to me.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.853
Go, we got this.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.692
Lucy, alert Dutch.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.144
Tell Johnny I'm coming.

13:46.618 --> 13:47.994
Where you taking--

13:53.333 --> 13:54.664
You shouldn't be here.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.580
- I couldn't resist.
You have her? - You doubted?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.547
Show me!

14:05.178 --> 14:07.009
Once we're all clear,
destroy this place for me.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.967
That's the least I could do.

14:13.228 --> 14:15.469
- Be careful!
- Be brutal. Go!

14:28.869 --> 14:31.110
Take those tacky things off.
You look like waiters.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.287
Welcome home.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.166
— The commander is in position.
- Good.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.415
Begin!

15:07.616 --> 15:09.197
- Sir.
- Yeah, I see 'em!

15:09.576 --> 15:12.613
Okay, people, let's play some
goddamn Hullen whack-a-mole.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.373
Batten the hatches and
grab your asses, people.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.955
Stations!

15:17.751 --> 15:20.493
Pilots, report to deck.
Good luck out there

15:26.301 --> 15:29.464
- Shit! John? John?
- He's cyanotic. Move.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.420
Don't be the heart, don't be the heart,
don't be the heart

15:32.641 --> 15:33.756
It's not.
His lung's collapsed.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.723
He can't breathe.
Hold him still.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.354
Okay, okay...

15:44.820 --> 15:47.402
- Aneela, she's here.
- We have to get him to med bay.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.980
John, where's Dutch?

15:56.998 --> 15:58.408
Balls!

16:12.639 --> 16:14.880
Hello, welche to Kendry Air.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.553
/ do hope you enjoy
your time with us today.

16:18.019 --> 16:22.979
If you look out your cockpit window,
you'll see the war has begun without you.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.023
No!

16:39.040 --> 16:40.996
All Cleansed pilots,
take positions.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.578
Wait on my order.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.712
40% of fleet within kill zone.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.123
- 45%
- Wait for my word.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.884
- Your word?
- My house, my call.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.677
- My ass!
- 60%

16:55.140 --> 16:57.722
- Half of them are gonna be through the
other side soon. - I know what I'm doing.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.682
78%.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.893
Sir, they're within
targeting distance of us now.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.315
- Do it! - Wait, God damn it.
Don't you know how to thread a needle?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.736
Pree, crank it!

17:12.157 --> 17:13.442
Now, now, now, now!

17:13.617 --> 17:14.982
You heard the angry little man.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.366
Power that shit up!

17:16.578 --> 17:18.443
Give it room.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.255
Hitting satelites now.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.638
- Kill zone is live.
- Fancy, you're up!

17:39.059 --> 17:40.549
Give those green boogers hell.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.769
Their navs are fried as eggs.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.145
But they still got ballistics.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.730
- Be careful out there.
- Copy that.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.937
On our way!

17:52.948 --> 17:55.030
All squads!
Engage and sweep.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.160
Fancy, watch your six!

18:15.512 --> 18:17.173
We're clear of first wave.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.175
Enemy ships down.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.308
- Return to base.
- Nice work out there, Fancy.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.053
I know.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.729
All right, Jaqobis.
We bought you your window.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.733
Now go kill that alpha
bitch for us so we can end this.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.148
Whoo! That was horrifying.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.154
I'm not okay.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.734
Who needs a beer, right?

18:37.742 --> 18:38.777
This guy needs a beer!

18:39.160 --> 18:42.573
You do! This guy does
not need a beer, he's good.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.754
| Do you care to
explain your failure?

18:54.092 --> 18:56.003
Or would you rather tell Aneela?

18:57.804 --> 19:01.217
The humans have been
very busy and very clever.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.634
Really?

19:03.143 --> 19:04.724
Do you math, Gander?

19:05.604 --> 19:06.935
Because | math,

19:07.314 --> 19:09.396
and my numbers say, "Easy win".

19:09.691 --> 19:12.649
It's not the numbers
so much as the obstacle.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.606
It looks like they've
built a distortion field

19:15.614 --> 19:17.570
that prevents our
ships from approaching.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.067
- Can't get close enough to board.
- Then find the source.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.987
We already have.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.331
You're up, General.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.837
The ship is prepped and ready.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.920
Stuff a bandage on your brother,
get him a doctor's note, and saddle up.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.723
You can't be in two places.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.683
I need to be.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.348
Dutch is missing, so is Delle Seyah.

19:49.606 --> 19:52.063
We had a deal. We were
supposed to go after Aneela together.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.356
You think Dutch jumped the
gun and took off for the Armada?

19:54.569 --> 19:56.651
I think she'd do just about
anything to keep everyone else safe,

19:56.988 --> 19:58.319
to put herself at risk. Yeah!

19:58.657 --> 20:01.239
- l have to get her myself. - That's dumb!
Those are terrible odds.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.866
I can't let Dutch
face down Aneela alone,

20:04.037 --> 20:05.322
John is out of commission.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.738
John's right here and
ready to go, drama queen.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.120
- Quit flapping your balls.
- You are in no shape for a mission.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.827
I'm in amazing shape!
I will wrestle you right now.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.629
- If you cough hard, your
lungs will fall out. - Jealous?

20:16.633 --> 20:18.419
It's a feature,
not a bug!

20:19.260 --> 20:21.512
Hey...

20:22.222 --> 20:23.587
You wanna go safe Dutch?

20:24.808 --> 20:25.888
Let's safe Dutch!

20:25.892 --> 20:27.393
Are you actual morrons?

20:27.686 --> 20:28.892
He can't take any more trauma.

20:29.104 --> 20:30.890
Yeah, well, what kind of
trauma do you think he'll go through

20:31.064 --> 20:32.224
if Dutch dies alone
because we weren't there?

20:32.399 --> 20:36.608
Ah, good news we got Aneela's magic
prison box already loaded on Khlyen's ship.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.476
All we got to do is
special-delivery it to her face.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.483
- Somehow.
- Figure we'll improvise?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.526
- Yeah. - That
sounds like us. All right.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.949
- You... John, you can't!
- Let it go, Zeph.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.119
I'm serious! You can't go,
because... I love you.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.748
Whoa! I just tried that out of desperation,
given the circumstance,

20:56.005 --> 20:57.961
and, nope, not good,
do not want.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.297
— Same.
- Fine.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.051
Go. Just came back with her.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.346
- Hey, get over here.
- Come on!

21:07.100 --> 21:09.011
Jaqobis sandwich.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.059
- For luck.
- Ugh! You smell like sports.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.598
Please stand by
for further orders.

21:17.652 --> 21:21.816
I'm sorry. Probably not the
exotic honeymoon we had in mind.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.525
I think it's pretty good.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.861
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:26.494 --> 21:29.236
- I've never been
out of Old Town.- Liar.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.701
ScandaH

21:32.959 --> 21:35.917
Pree, I'm a fourth-generation
miner from a third-tier moon.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.749
Thanks to you,
here I am on Leith,

21:39.215 --> 21:41.251
fighting aliens with
a bunch of warlords,

21:41.551 --> 21:43.792
eating exotic can meats.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.843
I married up.

21:46.139 --> 21:49.256
That is so... sad.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.972
- Sweet as shit, but sad.
- Shut up!

21:56.399 --> 21:59.607
Incoming!
It's a raid.

22:02.405 --> 22:07.695
What do I do? Pree,
what do I do? Pree!

22:08.119 --> 22:10.735
Okay, Turin! We're
gonna need help down here.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.116
They found us,
we got Hullen in the air.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.873
Shit! If they lock on
onto the Sonic's signal,

22:16.127 --> 22:17.242
they'll take it out from the air.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.955
We have to shut it down.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.579
Then Dutch and the boys better
make triple time to the Armada.

22:22.801 --> 22:23.836
Company! Move!

22:24.052 --> 22:26.008
Pree, I'm sending extraction
coordinates for an evac,

22:26.221 --> 22:27.882
grab that Sonic and giddyup.

22:28.139 --> 22:31.427
If I get there before you,
I am gonna shave your head in your sleep.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.683
Fall back!

22:39.442 --> 22:42.605
If we have no killzone,
we have no protection. What now?

22:43.655 --> 22:46.112
Now they come for us.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.027
Okay, here we go.

22:52.664 --> 22:53.949
Final approach.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.201
What makes you think they
won't roast us on entry?

22:56.501 --> 22:58.457
l cloned Delle Sayeh's ship
data when she was with us.

22:58.670 --> 23:00.831
The scanners should just read us
as one of their returning ships.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.082
Should?

23:02.382 --> 23:05.374
- So, this isn't foolproof?
- Yeah. I'm a nerd, not a genius.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.588
Great! Now you tell me.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.509
- Ah! Shit pants! - Turin, you got
another wave incoming. What's going on?

23:15.812 --> 23:18.349
We're sacked, that's
the basic situation.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.935
The relays are down,
we're wide open here.

23:21.526 --> 23:24.859
So, if you're gonna take down Aneela,
now would be a good time.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.940
Clock's almost
out of ticks.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.404
Pree we're taking fire.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.820
Us too. Regroup
at the ravine.

23:32.036 --> 23:35.324
- We're sourrounded!
- Go, go, go!

23:41.296 --> 23:44.038
Okay, once we find Dutch,
we make a plan to isolate Aneela.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.250
Agreed!

23:45.258 --> 23:47.795
So were you gonna tell me that you
and Dutch are back on the sex train?

23:48.011 --> 23:49.876
What? How do you know?

23:50.138 --> 23:51.878
Please! I have two
eyes and a heart.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.009
Lucy told you!

23:54.017 --> 23:55.507
100%, like, the moment it happened.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.092
Girl likes her gossip.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.554
So? What are your intentions?

24:00.857 --> 24:02.939
I intend not to die today.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.895
intend to save her beautiful,
stubborn ass,

24:05.111 --> 24:07.318
and if you keep being weird about this,
I intend to poke you in the lung hole.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.109
See, this is why you are
my least favorite brother.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.570
- Was it this empty when you
brain-hopped over here? - Nope.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.406
I know Delle Sayeh's unpopular,
but this is a bit much.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.574
Hey! Chest Wound McGee,
get behind me.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.494
lfl let you take all the bullets,
I'll never hear the end of it.

24:24.714 --> 24:25.749
I'm sure there's enough to share.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.585
You stole my line.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.500
- Now you may destroy the
RAC station. - Are you sure?

24:30.762 --> 24:34.095
- Nothing left there we need.
- Cut the shit, bitch queen.

24:34.098 --> 24:37.511
- Just take us to Dutch.
- Oh, but she's not here.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.894
Aneela wanted a little
private time with her.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.223
Where is she?

25:05.088 --> 25:06.544
Hello.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.261
Now?

25:17.100 --> 25:18.465
Shall we begin?

25:26.150 --> 25:28.812
You're more delicate
than I thought.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.023
You seem appropriately evil.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.150
Why bring me here?

25:34.575 --> 25:36.281
So we could be alone.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.198
I prefer group hangs.
More of an extrovert.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.746
Why did you kill Alvis?

25:43.376 --> 25:44.741
Who?

25:45.712 --> 25:47.373
The monk!
My friend!

25:48.715 --> 25:49.921
Oh!

25:50.425 --> 25:55.215
I wouldn't start counting
your dead friends just yet.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.846
Where did you get that?

25:59.267 --> 26:00.382
From you,

26:00.810 --> 26:03.096
before I stabbed it
into one of your Jaqobis.

26:03.604 --> 26:07.062
The big one. Or was it the little?
Who can remember?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.569
That was dumb!

26:11.154 --> 26:12.690
Hurting your friends?

26:13.114 --> 26:15.070
Leaving me alive after.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.282
Khlyen meant that for you,
and I intend to use it.

26:19.245 --> 26:23.409
How dare you
speak his name to me?

26:25.043 --> 26:27.204
How dare you?

26:44.979 --> 26:48.142
- You gotta hold that line!
- Shaffer, loney, fall back!

26:48.316 --> 26:49.726
Behind! Behind!

26:50.026 --> 26:51.186
God damn it!

26:51.360 --> 26:54.102
- I don't know what to--
- Gibson is down!

26:54.697 --> 26:55.857
McNair too.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.861
I'm calling it. Full retreat.
Get your asses back here.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.402
Fancy? You copy?

27:02.705 --> 27:04.161
We're being boarded.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.665
Station is compromised.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.659
Evac protocol.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.045
Prep the ship and
lead the evac. Now!

27:13.382 --> 27:14.667
What about you?

27:15.093 --> 27:16.583
Where're you going?

27:16.761 --> 27:18.843
I'm going to leave you
in the lab for Aneela.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.636
She'll decide
what to do with you.

27:20.807 --> 27:23.389
- You're wasting time.
- If Dutch dies, so does Aneela.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.934
Well.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.604
Well that's a small detail
that would have been nice to know

27:30.608 --> 27:32.189
as I went through all the
effort of planning this.

27:33.820 --> 27:37.563
- You'd think Aneela would have
mentioned that. - She doesn't know.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.485
It has to do with how they're connected.

27:39.742 --> 27:42.404
And Khlyen stole those memories from her.
It's part of why she's so scattered.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.869
Her own father poked holes in her brain.

27:46.707 --> 27:47.742
You're bluffing!

27:47.750 --> 27:50.036
And you're risking her life
with every second that we lose,

27:50.044 --> 27:51.033
which works for me,

27:51.254 --> 27:53.586
but you're also risking the
life of someone I love, and, lady,

27:54.132 --> 27:56.373
I am not gonna do that
dance with you again.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.552
Why do you think we
came here on the sneak?

27:58.761 --> 28:00.843
Because we knew Aneela
would fight a direct hit.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.839
- We couldn't risk a battle that would kill her.
- That's the same reason we kidnapped Dutch.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.053
We need her alive.

28:07.311 --> 28:08.517
Honestly?

28:08.855 --> 28:11.938
I don't see how this day ends without
all of us losing the women that we love.

28:12.275 --> 28:15.312
You know them.
They won't stop, they won't give in.

28:15.570 --> 28:16.685
But you can stop Aneela.

28:16.863 --> 28:19.775
We can stop Dutch,
if you hurry.

28:24.537 --> 28:25.902
Bring them to my ship.

28:26.956 --> 28:31.245
If you're lying, I will
feed you to my little urchin.

28:34.463 --> 28:37.296
- Is that true about
Dutch and Aneela? - No ided.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.259
But it bought us some time.

28:44.849 --> 28:46.089
Hey, Turin!

28:46.392 --> 28:47.677
Get down!

28:50.104 --> 28:51.310
What happened out there?

28:51.314 --> 28:52.349
Where was our denfense?

28:52.565 --> 28:54.851
Hullen ground troops have
overtaken the relay station on Leith.

28:55.193 --> 28:56.729
Qresh is overrun,
Westerley too.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.018
The Sonic is down.

28:58.196 --> 29:00.687
- How the hells did they figure out we
were using the Sonic? - Doesn't matter!

29:00.907 --> 29:03.273
In about five seconds,
we'll be overrun with bug-brains,

29:03.284 --> 29:04.569
- and you can't be here!
- Why not?

29:04.744 --> 29:06.029
'Cause you're our only shot, Fancy.

29:06.329 --> 29:08.194
You got to get down to Leith,
get the Sonic from Pree,

29:08.664 --> 29:10.655
figure out a way to get it
back up here before it's too late.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.374
Cut off their retreat and give
our people a chance to escape.

29:13.586 --> 29:14.701
What about you?

29:14.962 --> 29:16.577
Captain goes down with
his ship you know that.

29:16.797 --> 29:17.877
You aren't our captain.

29:18.132 --> 29:20.168
Oh, just let me have my
goddamn hero moment, will you?

29:20.176 --> 29:22.633
- You piece of shit!
- Okay.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.964
You probably don't have
many years left anyway.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.879
You'd be surprised.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.552
I still have that
"new asshole" smell.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.096
Ready? Three,
two...

29:35.441 --> 29:36.977
You giht like him.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.267
I guess that's why
you're his favorite.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.832
Did he suffer?

30:00.841 --> 30:02.126
When you killed him?

30:02.510 --> 30:06.549
- He died protecting me
from you! - You exist.

30:07.390 --> 30:08.596
He doesn't.

30:08.849 --> 30:10.760
And now you'll
have to pay for that!

30:11.852 --> 30:14.138
For everything
you've taken from me.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.180
From you?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.356
When the nights were long,

30:25.449 --> 30:27.485
and the days were deep,

30:29.078 --> 30:31.990
there lived a girl...

30:35.543 --> 30:38.285
Those memories
are my whole life.

30:39.630 --> 30:42.292
What you gave me and
what you are taking from me.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.751
My entire existence has been hidden by you,
by Khlyen, from the Green.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.174
If you win today,
| disappear.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.256
Well, I'm done with shadows.

30:53.853 --> 30:56.014
I'm gonna kill
you now, Aneela,

30:56.355 --> 30:57.970
which will end me too.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.733
I accept dying!

31:05.031 --> 31:06.692
But I was here.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.027
l was real, and l mattered!

31:09.327 --> 31:11.659
And I will not be forgotten!

31:15.458 --> 31:17.744
I remember you.

31:27.303 --> 31:28.839
Where are the others?

31:29.638 --> 31:31.378
They'll be here.
They know the coordinates.

31:35.770 --> 31:38.386
- Okay, that felt pretty good.
- I thought you were a pacifist.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.395
- I guess I got over it.
- Yeah!

31:43.694 --> 31:45.935
-Pmd
-Ah! Thank the gods.

31:46.155 --> 31:48.066
- Where is the evac?
- You got the Sonic?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.697
Here and ready to go.
Lead the way.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.110
Why the Necropolis?

31:54.330 --> 31:57.743
I told you already, Aneela needed
privacy and from bigger things than you.

31:58.042 --> 31:59.703
Only one way in or out.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.958
It's the most defensible
place in the Quad.

32:02.880 --> 32:04.745
So?

32:05.716 --> 32:09.208
We didn't, like, do it, did we?

32:10.012 --> 32:12.594
-Hmm?
- Please. I'd still be washing.

32:13.891 --> 32:17.509
And you'd remember.

32:18.896 --> 32:21.638
- So where are you on circumcision?
- Please stop.

32:22.024 --> 32:26.142
You thought about names?
How do you feel about apostrophes?

32:26.320 --> 32:29.153
Guards if he keeps
talking to me, fry his face.

32:29.407 --> 32:32.194
Fine. Fathers have rights.
That's all I'm saying.

32:32.535 --> 32:34.196
They have.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.502
Come on, Red.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.547
Hey, assholes!
Forgot one in here!

32:52.680 --> 32:54.090
Gander wants this one.

32:54.432 --> 32:57.139
Are you gonna kill me or
give me the big green enema?

32:57.685 --> 33:01.473
'Cause if you want to Hullen-ize me, I'm into it.
See what all the fuss is about.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.930
I do have a few questions, though.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.598
One, does it hurt?

33:05.860 --> 33:07.942
Two, do | get to keep my hair?

33:08.195 --> 33:11.028
And three...
how stupid are you?

33:11.240 --> 33:12.980
Oh, no! Watch out!
He's got a pepper grinder.

33:13.284 --> 33:14.945
What next?
You toss our salad?

33:15.202 --> 33:16.988
I don't think that means
quite what you think it means,

33:17.413 --> 33:19.904
'cause this little baby means,
"Kiss your ass good-bye".

33:20.124 --> 33:22.365
These are good
people here. My people!

33:22.960 --> 33:24.575
You messed with
the wrong RAC.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.001
Oh, shit!

33:31.051 --> 33:32.587
- Where's the rest of the evac?
- I'm it.

33:32.887 --> 33:35.378
The RAC is overrun,
relay stations are falling.

33:35.389 --> 33:37.380
I'm not going without
my people, Fancy.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.381
I can't wait for them.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.560
You should go.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.270
We'll stay.

33:45.566 --> 33:46.851
Honeymoon's not over.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.812
I'll send back any
ships I can when it's done.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.151
If there's still a
RAC to come back to.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.566
We'll give you some ground-to-air
cover until you're clear.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.740
- Thank you. -
You'll make it, Fancy.

33:57.286 --> 34:00.870
You better.
With your bar tab...

34:08.672 --> 34:11.334
You're what's been
missing in my head.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.838
Why would he
do that to me?

34:16.055 --> 34:18.011
Why did you make me?

34:21.268 --> 34:22.804
Because I was lonely.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.103
I wanted to watch your life with Papa.

34:26.607 --> 34:28.313
Pretend it was mine.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.813
You were my chance
for happy memories.

34:32.029 --> 34:33.644
I'm not your anything!

34:34.198 --> 34:37.156
You don't get to make
me and throw me away.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.279
- I didn't.
-You did!

34:41.747 --> 34:45.456
-And I've paid for it. I'm still paying for it.
- So am I, Yalena.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.498
I named you after our mother.

34:51.674 --> 34:53.380
Did he tell you that?

34:56.554 --> 34:58.044
Why do you hate me so much?

35:00.391 --> 35:02.302
Because he loved you more.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.636
He's hid you from me for years.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.807
Like I was dirty,
like I was gonna break you.

35:12.152 --> 35:16.316
To protect us from what
you would do if you found me.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.401
Not me.

35:20.119 --> 35:21.404
The Lady.

35:21.912 --> 35:23.994
Who is the Lady, Aneela?

35:24.164 --> 35:27.873
The end of everything,
if she gets out of the Green.

35:28.335 --> 35:31.122
When I brought you out,
she felt it.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.505
Now she knows it can be done.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.424
I knew you were the solution.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.211
| just couldn't remember why.

35:41.849 --> 35:45.307
- So you want to put me back in?
- Yes.

35:47.730 --> 35:50.346
I need to close the door, Yala.

35:56.030 --> 35:58.692
Good. I'm ready to die,
but not for you.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.064
Alvis said you were the devil. Fine!

36:01.410 --> 36:03.401
Let's make a deal.

36:06.749 --> 36:09.912
We stop trying to kill each
other long enough to kill her.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.160
Finish what we started.

36:15.007 --> 36:21.719
- Dutch! -
I'm sorry.

36:26.935 --> 36:29.096
No!

36:46.789 --> 36:49.121
- Oh, she's angry!
- Who? I

36:49.917 --> 36:52.158
Stay! Protect our exit!

36:54.713 --> 36:56.499
No! No!

36:58.759 --> 37:00.920
What the hell was that?

37:03.138 --> 37:05.094
Both of them going in at once
must have weakened something.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.342
The Lady must be trying to get out.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.724
Great! Cool story.
Which is who?

37:09.061 --> 37:11.393
much older and
stronger than Aneela.

37:11.730 --> 37:14.392
John, I've arrived at the docking station,

37:14.692 --> 37:17.149
the Black Root ships are
swarming the Necropolis.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.602
Did you send your people here?
Ships are landing.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.607
Not mine.

37:22.282 --> 37:25.069
The Lady's. She controls all
the Hullen that aren't Aneela's.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.283
You can't let her
people near the pool.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.361
Dutch and Aneela will
never make it back out.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.996
Lucy, you got to blow the
elevator once we're back on board

37:32.292 --> 37:33.998
- so no one else can use it--
- There isn't time.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.243
They've landed,
I'm surrouned.

37:36.505 --> 37:37.711
It's not safe for you here.

37:37.923 --> 37:38.912
What? What's that look?

37:39.091 --> 37:41.798
- How many ships, Luce?
- 11 docked, more coming.

37:42.094 --> 37:45.086
The docking bay is compromised.
They'll be on us once we arrive.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.299
Okay? So we fight?

37:46.557 --> 37:48.843
That's what you do, right?
Testosterone isn't just for beards.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.220
Yeah, me, an injured guy,
and a pregnant lady.

37:51.395 --> 37:52.805
- We won't win!
- What are you saying?

37:53.105 --> 37:55.061
He's saying brace yourself.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.614
- What now? - Lucy, you got to
sever the shaft from both ends.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.616
But then you won 't
be able to reach me.

38:08.871 --> 38:10.202
You'll be floating in space.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.821
It's a risk we gotta take.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.911
- On one condition.
- If it protects Aneela, anything!

38:15.127 --> 38:16.492
Call off the war now!

38:16.754 --> 38:18.585
Your people stand down, or we do.

38:18.839 --> 38:21.000
- Is this your parley?
- No, it's my ultimatum.

38:21.383 --> 38:22.714
The war's over.
I win!

38:23.177 --> 38:24.917
Or we all die right now.

38:25.345 --> 38:28.803
- You realize he's bartering with
Dutch's life? - She'd want us to.

38:34.688 --> 38:37.054
Wait. Who's
minding the bar?

38:37.357 --> 38:39.518
Once we reach those trees,
there's too many.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.017
We'll never make it out.

38:44.281 --> 38:45.521
Okay.

38:46.158 --> 38:47.318
I accept your terms.

38:47.534 --> 38:51.527
I don't, John. If the trajectory aligns,
you could boomerang into the sun.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.204
Yeah, but it's a dry heat.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.121
Screw it!

39:02.966 --> 39:05.252
What is this?
What are they doing?

39:05.928 --> 39:07.464
There, done!

39:08.472 --> 39:09.803
They are surrendering.

39:13.644 --> 39:14.929
Do it, Luce.

39:19.733 --> 39:22.896
- Ready, count us down.
- Five...

39:24.446 --> 39:26.186
- Shut up!
- Four...

39:26.490 --> 39:29.653
Okay, last question, promise.
Do | get my own Hullen name?

39:29.868 --> 39:33.326
- Or do you all go by "shitbag"?
- Your sense of humor is the first thing we'll cure.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.411
Damn. I was really
hoping it'd be the herp.

39:36.250 --> 39:38.491
I got a pretty powerful case.
You know how it is.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.175
You still got that
"new asshole" smell.

39:59.356 --> 40:00.857
Three...

40:07.489 --> 40:10.652
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Human, human! I'm I'm totally human.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.739
And, uh, I'm also single.
I don't know if I mentioned that--

40:17.833 --> 40:20.700
Two... one...

40:30.053 --> 40:32.430
Oh, man, lhope
there's a bathroom in here.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.966
They're gonna be okay.

40:38.604 --> 40:39.559
We can get them back.

40:39.730 --> 40:42.938
If we figure a way out of this
flying box before our air runs out

40:43.358 --> 40:45.189
and | eat you two for sport.

40:48.488 --> 40:52.606
- So, about baby names...
- Oh, you need to kill me again, please.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.987
I've always liked "Michelle".

40:55.412 --> 40:57.152
It's bossy, but it means well.

40:57.456 --> 41:00.198
Do you have a birthing plan?
Doula? I know a guy.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.704
What about the sex?
Do you even want to know the sex?

41:03.879 --> 41:06.461
- I don't want to know the sex.
- Okay, I don't want guns in my house.

41:07.341 --> 41:10.424
- How involved will Aneela be as a parent?
- Very.

41:10.594 --> 41:13.802
- Yeah, I don't know if that's
gonna work out very - That's okay. I don't care.

41:30.906 --> 41:33.943
- Where are we?
- I call it the Greenspace.

41:34.785 --> 41:37.572
The space between all
the memories that we store.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.998
It's where you were born.

41:56.723 --> 41:58.884
How do we know where to
find the Lady in here?

41:59.101 --> 42:00.841
She'll find us.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.055
Stop! It might not be him.

42:07.734 --> 42:10.851
- Oh, it's definitely him.
- How do you know?

42:11.989 --> 42:13.775
Because, little birds,

42:16.952 --> 42:19.034
I'm the one that
made you these.

42:30.382 --> 42:32.668
The universe has a memory.

42:34.386 --> 42:35.922
Ready, ladies?

42:36.263 --> 42:38.595
And this is
