(thunder)

02:29.140 --> 02:30.141
I'M SORRY.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.000
NO, I--

02:31.110 --> 02:32.270
IT'S MY FAULT.

02:32.380 --> 02:34.473
NOTHING IS
ANYBODY'S FAULT.

02:35.850 --> 02:36.987
WELL...

02:37.090 --> 02:38.546
GOODNIGHT.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.222
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.113
( phone ringing )

03:42.220 --> 03:44.586
( snoring )

03:49.960 --> 03:51.154
DAVID FISHER.

03:51.260 --> 03:52.397
( female )
Oh my God, David,
is that you ?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.855
I'M SORRY, CAN YOU
HOLD ON JUST A SECOND ?

03:57.230 --> 03:57.924
HELLO ?

03:58.030 --> 03:58.724
David ?

03:58.830 --> 03:59.899
YEAH ?

04:00.000 --> 04:00.967
It's Jennifer.

04:01.070 --> 04:02.139
HI.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.935
My father's
been killed !

04:04.040 --> 04:05.735
OH MY GOD,
I'M SO SORRY.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.478
HOW DID IT HAPPEN ?

04:07.580 --> 04:09.104
He was struck
by lightning.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.144
WOW.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.444
Do you think
you can handle it ?

04:12.550 --> 04:14.017
YEAH, OF COURSE
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.008
David,
are you okay ?

04:16.120 --> 04:17.519
NO, THAT'S JUST--

04:17.620 --> 04:18.712
You sound--

04:18.820 --> 04:20.014
HOLD ON,
IT'S JUST...

04:20.120 --> 04:22.520
IT'S MY MOUTH GUARD.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.359
SO I DON'T GRIND
MY TEETH WHEN I SLEEP.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.882
( loud snoring )

04:25.990 --> 04:27.196
WHAT THE FUCK ?

04:27.300 --> 04:28.426
JEN NIFER'S
FATHER DIED.

04:28.530 --> 04:29.997
I can't believe it.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.328
I HOPE
SHE'S MARRIED.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.364
THAT WAY I WON'T
HAVE TO FEEL SO GUILTY

04:33.470 --> 04:35.495
FOR WASTING ALMOST
TWO YEARS OF HER LIFE.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.262
EVERY WOMAN NEEDS TO GO THROUGH
FALLING IN LOVE WITH A GAY MAN,

04:38.370 --> 04:40.270
IT'S A TOTAL FEMALE
RITE OF PASSAGE.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.779
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT CLAIRE
AND WHAT'S-HIS-FACE ?

04:41.880 --> 04:44.246
KEITH, DON'T YOU EVER TELL HER
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.647
I'M SERIOUS.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.968
JUST LIKE EVERY GAY MAN
NEEDS TO GO THROUGH A PERIOD

04:48.080 --> 04:49.513
WHERE HE TRIES
TO BE STRAIGHT.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.985
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A REQUIREMENT ANYMORE.

04:51.090 --> 04:53.388
I THINK WE WERE MAYBE THE LAST
GENERATION THAT DID THAT.

04:53.490 --> 04:56.550
WHAT ABOUT CLAIRE
AND WHAT'S-HIS-FACE ?

04:58.730 --> 05:00.857
SO, I'M BACK
ON CELESTE DUTY TODAY.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.188
ANOTHER TALK SHOW ?

05:02.300 --> 05:04.518
SOME REHEARSAL FOR
SOME CHARITY TOMORROW.

05:06.030 --> 05:08.134
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR ?

05:08.240 --> 05:12.734
UH, HELMUT LANG JEANS,
BLACK T-SHIRT,

05:12.840 --> 05:14.979
THE FADED BANANA REPUBLIC ONE
WITH THE STRETCH,

05:15.080 --> 05:17.401
AND BLACK
LACE-UP BOOTS.

05:17.510 --> 05:19.614
DAVID, THIS IS
A PROFESSION, OKAY ?

05:20.680 --> 05:22.511
THERE IS AN IMAGE
TO PROJECT.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.180
AND THAT IMAGE ISN'T
FUCKING KEITH OF FINLAND.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.758
ARE YOU NOT
OUT ON THE JOB ?

05:27.860 --> 05:30.351
NO ONE'S EVER ASKED.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.018
YOU BIG WHORE.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.394
WHAT, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
ONLY DEFINED BY BEING GAY.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.853
I'M DEFINED BY
BEING A LOT OF THINGS.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.224
BEING BLACK,
BEING AMERICAN, BEING--

05:38.330 --> 05:39.490
BUSTED ?

05:39.600 --> 05:40.794
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME
BECAUSE I WAS NOT OUT !

05:40.900 --> 05:42.162
YEAH, TO YOUR FAMILY.

05:42.270 --> 05:44.101
IT'S NOT LIKE I EXPECT YOU
TO COME OUT TO EVERY PERSON

05:44.210 --> 05:45.859
WHO WALKS THROUGH
THE FUNERAL HOME.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.074
NOR DO I EXPECT YOU TO COME OUT
TO EVERY CLIENT YOU HAVE,

05:48.180 --> 05:50.000
WHETHER IT'S CELESTE
OR CAMERON DIAZ

05:50.110 --> 05:51.941
OR IAN FUCKING MCKELLAN.

05:52.050 --> 05:53.369
BUT THE PEOPLE
YOU WORK WITH--

05:53.480 --> 05:54.617
CALM DOWN.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.883
I'M NOT THE ENEMY,
I'M YOUR LOVER.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.915
THANKS, BARB,
SHE'S NEVER BEEN BEFORE.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.181
SERIOUSLY, YOU'VE NEVER
TAKEN MAYA TO LEGOLAND ?

06:04.290 --> 06:05.655
NO.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.627
SHE WAS TOO YOUNG FOR IT
UNTIL, BASICALLY, NOW ?

06:08.730 --> 06:12.097
I USED TO LOVE TO PLAY WITH
THOSE BLOCKS WHEN I WAS A KID.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.132
DIDN'T YOU ?

06:13.240 --> 06:16.232
DOES MAYA
LOVE THEM ?

06:16.340 --> 06:17.967
TOO YOUNG,
SMALL PARTS,
CHOKING ?

06:18.070 --> 06:21.437
OH, DEAR, SHE'S STILL
THAT ORALLY FIXATED.

06:21.540 --> 06:24.976
WELL, NO WONDER, SHE WAS
STILL BREAST-FEEDING WHEN--

06:26.110 --> 06:27.145
YEAH.

06:28.820 --> 06:30.082
HEY.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.942

EVERY DAY, DOESN'T SHE ?

06:32.050 --> 06:33.312
YEAH, KIDS
KINDA DO THAT.

06:33.420 --> 06:34.887
YOU GOT ME.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.322
OH THANKS.

06:37.430 --> 06:38.624
UNCLE NATE ?

06:38.730 --> 06:39.651
YEAH.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.694
COULD YOU BE SURE
AND GIVE THIS TO DAVID ?

06:43.930 --> 06:44.965
YEAH, SURE.

06:45.070 --> 06:46.196
OKAY.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.130
TELL HIM THAT
IT'S FROM MICHAELA.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.162
RIGHT.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.628
OKAY, SO WE'LL DROP HER OFF
ON SUNDAY AROUND SIX OR SO.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.378
HEY, LISTEN, YOU GUYS.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.845
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR DOING THIS.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.474
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU EVER NEED THAT I COULD--

06:59.580 --> 07:02.378
WELL, YEAH, WE DO NEED,
I GUESS, WHAT, HOYT ?

07:02.490 --> 07:05.448
100 BUCKS,
MAYBE 120.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.689
FOR YOU KNOW,
MAYA'S SHARE OF THE HOTEL,

07:07.790 --> 07:09.826
AND THE PARKING,
AND THE RESTAURANTS...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.181
STROLLER RENTAL.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.554
OF COURSE, YEAH.

07:13.660 --> 07:16.595
OH, LOOK, COULD
YOU JUST TAKE HER ?

07:19.370 --> 07:20.667
DOES MAYA

07:20.770 --> 07:22.658
YEAH, YEAH,
SHE LOVES IT.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.144
SHE LOVES IT.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.275
HERE YOU GO.

07:33.380 --> 07:36.144
SAY GOOD-BYE
TO DADDY, HONEY.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.784
BYE, BABY GIRL.

07:42.890 --> 07:44.585
I LOVE YOU.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.025
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

07:50.330 --> 07:52.366
NATE, ARE YOU
DOING OKAY ?

07:52.470 --> 07:53.994
YEAH, YOU KNOW...

07:55.600 --> 07:57.238
IT COMES AND GOES.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.305
I CAN APPRECIATE
THE ATI'EMPT,

08:00.410 --> 08:04.073
BUT I THINK IT LOOKS
LIKE SOMETHING YOU'D SEE

08:04.180 --> 08:09.618
ON A CALENDAR, LIKE IN
SOME BARGAIN BIN SOMEWHERE,

08:09.720 --> 08:12.188
LIKE THREE MONTHS
AFTER THE NEW YEAR.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.656
CAN YOU BE
A LITTLE MORE HARSH ?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.422
NO, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
A STYLISH CALENDAR,

08:17.530 --> 08:18.724
IN AN UPSCALE STORE.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.354
OKAY, SO THIS PIECE
IS NO GOOD.

08:20.460 --> 08:21.996
LET'S MOVE ON.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.795
I THINK THE QUESTION IS NOT
SO MUCH, IS THIS PIECE GOOD ?

08:23.900 --> 08:27.791
I WOULD RATHER WE ASK,
IS THIS PIECE SUCCESSFUL ?

08:27.900 --> 08:30.698
YEAH, WELL, THIS IS AMERICA,
SUCCESSFUL EQUALS GOOD.

08:30.810 --> 08:35.634
SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING
ITS INTENTION.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.172
ANITA, WHAT WAS YOUR
INTENT WITH THIS PIECE ?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.680
I DON'T KNOW.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.213
I LIKED THE WAY THE LIGHT
WAS HITTING HER HEAD.

08:46.350 --> 08:47.487
DO WE HAVE TO GO
INTO EVERY PIECE

08:47.590 --> 08:48.955
KNOWING EXACTLY
WHAT IT MEANS ?

08:49.060 --> 08:50.527
NO, BUT SURELY IT ENDED UP
MEANING SOMETHING TO YOU,

08:50.630 --> 08:53.019
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT IT INTO CLASS.

09:27.100 --> 09:27.691
OH.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.620
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS !

09:31.130 --> 09:33.337
I THOUGHT ARTHUR
WAS MERELY ECCENTRIC,

09:33.440 --> 09:36.568
I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS
SERIOUSLY DISTURBED.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.807
KINDA BRINGS NEW MEANING
TO THE TERM DUMP TRUCK, HUH ?

09:45.810 --> 09:47.346
( dance music )

09:47.450 --> 09:51.887
* YOU'RE JUST A LEGEND
IN YOUR OWN MIND, AREN'T YA *

09:53.420 --> 09:54.785
NO MARKING, SAMMY !

09:54.890 --> 09:58.678
* YOU'RE NEVER EVER
GONNA BE MINE, ARE YA *

09:58.790 --> 10:00.997
SLOPPY,
YOU GUYS BLOW !

10:01.100 --> 10:02.192
HEY, JAVIER.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.120
HOW MANY OF THOSE GUYS
YOU THINK SHE FUCKED ?

10:04.230 --> 10:07.461
THEM FAGGOTS ARE
TOO BUSY FUCKING EACH OTHER

10:07.570 --> 10:08.992
TO EVER WORK
HER IN.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.101
RIGHT ?

10:10.210 --> 10:13.475
YO, K.
WHAT'S UP ?

10:13.580 --> 10:15.138

WITH US NEXT MONTH ?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.549

WAITING TO HEAR.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.299
( Celeste )
YOU SUCK !

10:27.760 --> 10:30.888
DAVID, THIS IS
MY FIANC, GREG SUTTON.

10:30.990 --> 10:31.854
HI, GREG.

10:31.960 --> 10:32.949
I'M GLAD

10:33.060 --> 10:34.322
YEAH, ME TOO.

10:34.430 --> 10:35.749

10:38.670 --> 10:42.902
HE'D BEEN DEPRESSED FOR YEARS,
EVER SINCE MY MOM DIVORCED HIM.

10:44.570 --> 10:46.208
WELL, YOU REMEMBER.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.905
YES.

10:49.010 --> 10:50.898
WILL YOUR MOTHER BE
COMING TO THE FUNERAL ?

10:51.550 --> 10:53.108
NO, SHE'S...

10:54.680 --> 10:56.819
IN A NURSING HOME.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.012
YOU'RE KIDDING,
SHE'S SO YOUNG.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.281
HONEY, I DON'T MEAN
TO RUSH YOU,

11:00.390 --> 11:04.759
BUT I'VE GOTI'A BE BACK ON
THE SITE BY NOON, THE LATEST.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.327
SO WHAT'S GOING
ON TOUR LIKE ?

11:12.430 --> 11:14.898
ALRIGHT.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.867
THING ABOUT CELESTE,
EVERY CONCERT'S PACKED

11:17.970 --> 11:21.303
WITH TEENAGE GIRLS FUCKING
HORNY OUT OF THEIR MINDS,

11:21.410 --> 11:23.970
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING ?

11:24.080 --> 11:25.547
YOU BETTER MAKE SURE
YOU'RE CHECKING I.D.'S,

11:25.650 --> 11:27.208
YOU CAN FIND
YOUR ASS IN JAIL.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.140
NAW, YOU JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T VIDEOTAPE NOTHING.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.548
WHAT, YOU MARRIED ?

11:31.650 --> 11:35.950
NO, NOT MARRIED,
BUT WE LIVE TOGETHER.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.322
DON'T DO IT.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.749
I'M ON NUMBER THREE,

11:38.860 --> 11:40.725
I CAN'T SEEM
TO FUCKING LEARN.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.821
I DON'T WANT
TO PLAY MYSELF.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.329
I WANNA PLAY
SOMEONE UGLY OR FAT.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.967
SOMETHING THAT'LL SHOW
I CAN BE A SERIOUS ACTRESS.

11:47.070 --> 11:48.833
HEY, YOU MIND IF I ASK
YOU A PERSONAL QUESTION ?

11:48.940 --> 11:52.034
IF I DO,
I WON'T ANSWER IT.

11:52.140 --> 11:56.804
HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK
DO YOU GET YOUR POLE WET ?

11:57.610 --> 11:58.679
WHAT ?

11:58.780 --> 12:00.316
I'M CURIOUS.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.480
IT AVERAGES OUT I GUESS TO
ABOUT FIVE OR SIX TIMES A WEEK.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.945
DAMN.

12:06.050 --> 12:08.189
YOU DON'T NEED
TO GO ON TOUR.

12:08.290 --> 12:10.588
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

12:10.690 --> 12:12.829
ONCE.

12:12.930 --> 12:16.297
TWICE IF I'M LUCKY
OR IF I BUY HER SOMETHING.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.561
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.490
THAT IS SO
MOTHERFUCKIN' NOT GOOD.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.036
( Celeste )
SEE IF YOU CAN AT LEAST GET
SOME FREE CLOTHES OUT OF IT.

12:24.140 --> 12:28.133
These two great black balls
of male erotic fury,

12:28.240 --> 12:31.403
go to explode
on one another.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.444
THAT'S WHEN
EVERYTHING STARTED.

12:33.550 --> 12:35.370
FROM THOSE
CAVE PAINTINGS.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.141
THAT WAS THE CREATION
OF THE IDEA OF "IMAGE,"

12:37.250 --> 12:38.979
OF THE REPRESENTATION
OF OURSELVES.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.752
EXACTLY, AND THAT'S WHEN WE
STOPPED LIVING INSIDE NATURE,

12:41.860 --> 12:43.782
AND STARTED LIVING
INSIDE OUR HEADS.

12:43.890 --> 12:47.291
YEAH, WHICH IS WHY WE CAN
JUST SIT BACK AND WATCH

12:47.400 --> 12:49.789
WHILE GREEDY CORPORATE
BUSH-SUCKERS DESTROY NATURE,

12:49.900 --> 12:51.891
SINCE WE'RE NO LONGER
A PART OF IT.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.036
IF YOU TAKE HUMANS
OUT OF NATURE,

12:54.140 --> 12:55.892
THEN ALL THEY ARE LEFT
WITH IS HUMAN NATURE.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.106
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS
REALLY GOOD,

12:59.210 --> 13:02.304
BUT WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT MEAN ?

13:03.310 --> 13:05.369
( laughing )

13:05.480 --> 13:08.313
OH, OLIVIER.

13:11.650 --> 13:13.914
IT'S NO DOUBT
HIS NEW ASSISTANT.

13:14.020 --> 13:16.488
I HEARD YOU
FUCKED HIM.

13:16.590 --> 13:17.659
NO!

13:17.760 --> 13:20.194
I DID NOT FUCK HIM.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.723
SO, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO BE SO
MEAN DURING MY CRIT, YOU BITCH ?

13:22.830 --> 13:25.594
OR WAS THAT JUST
THE NEW CLAIRE FISHER ?

13:25.700 --> 13:27.839
THERE'S A NEW
CLAIRE FISHER ?

13:27.940 --> 13:30.158
WHAT WAS WRONG
WITH THE OLD ONE ?

13:30.270 --> 13:34.309
SHE JUST WAITED AROUND FOR
THE WORLD TO HAPPEN TO HER.

13:39.780 --> 13:41.418
HEY, JIMMY.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.509
WHAT THE FUCK ?!

13:42.620 --> 13:44.247
OH GOD, I SORRY.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.955
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING
TO BE LIKE A CHARMING MOMENT

13:47.060 --> 13:48.709
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO KILL ME.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.856
NO WAY.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.326
WHAT GOOD WOULD
MY LIFE BE WITHOUT YOU ?

13:53.430 --> 13:55.022
SHUT UP.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.663
SO, CLAIRE FISHER.

13:57.770 --> 14:01.433
YES, JIMMY.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.839
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
I KNOW WHAT YOUR LAST NAME IS ?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.132
I WOULD LOVE
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.604
SAY WHEN.

14:12.710 --> 14:17.283
OKAY, YOU ARE
VERGING DANGEROUSLY
CLOSE ON BEING SMARMY.

14:19.290 --> 14:22.214
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.254
I CAN COME OVER
TOMORROW AFTERNOON,

14:24.360 --> 14:27.488
BUT I HAVE TO BE HOME
BY SEVEN AT THE LATEST.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.056
NO!

14:29.160 --> 14:30.991
THAT'S HARDLY ANY TIME
WITH YOU AT ALL !

14:31.100 --> 14:32.931
AND NICOLE
MISSES YOU.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.689
Well, I miss
Nicole too, but,

14:34.800 --> 14:36.495
I HAVE KIDS OF
MY OWN, SOPHIA.

14:36.600 --> 14:40.502
FEDERICO, DID ARTHUR LEAVE SOME
SORT OF FORWARDING ADDRESS ?

14:40.610 --> 14:42.430
UH, NO,
I DON'T THINK SO.

14:42.540 --> 14:46.647
Vanessa, I'm gonna have to
call you back, okay sweetie ?

14:46.750 --> 14:47.774
VANESSA ?

14:47.880 --> 14:49.438
OH, NO, HE DIDN'T.

14:49.550 --> 14:52.212
HE HAS ENGAGED IN A CAMPAIGN OF
HARASSMENT AGAINST THIS FAMILY !

14:52.320 --> 14:54.288
RUTH, I WISH YOU
WOULD LET THIS GO.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.017
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF LETTING IT GO.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.781
IN FACT, I HAVE A GOOD MIND
TO GET THE AUTHORITIES INVOLVED.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.619
THAT'S NEVER
A GOOD IDEA.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.866
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT HERE ?

15:03.970 --> 15:06.939
MALE, 60$,
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

15:07.040 --> 15:10.931
AH, WHAT EXACTLY
HAPPENS TO A PERSON

15:11.040 --> 15:12.735
WHEN THEY GET
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING ?

15:12.840 --> 15:14.637
WELL, CARDIAC ARREST
IS WHAT KILLS 'EM,

15:17.480 --> 15:19.801
WHICH IN THIS CASE, WAS
HIS RIGHT ARM AND LEFT LEG,

15:19.910 --> 15:21.309
HENCE THE SEPARATE
EMBALMING.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.288
SO HE BECOMES A SORT OF
A HUMAN FULGURITE, AS IT WERE.

15:25.390 --> 15:28.154
FEDERICO, I NEED TO KNOW HOW
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ARTHUR !

15:28.260 --> 15:29.818
SURELY THERE'S SOME
WAY OF TRACING HIM.

15:29.920 --> 15:30.784
RUTH.

15:30.890 --> 15:32.551
CALM DOWN !

15:33.700 --> 15:35.156
FINE.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.627
I'LL JUST RESIGN MYSELF
TO RECEIVING EXCREMENT

15:39.730 --> 15:42.392
IN THE MAIL FOR THE REST
OF MDAYS ON THIS EARTH.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.438
YOU LITTLE SHIT.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.940
I'M STARTING TO LOSE
PATIENCE WITH ALL YOUR

15:52.050 --> 15:54.018
"SENSITIVE MAN"
BU LLSHIT.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.042
YOU'RE NOT
"SENSITIVE."

15:56.150 --> 15:57.788
YOU'RE A FUCKING EUNUCH.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.642
A CASTRATO.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.956
CASTRATO,
I LIKE THAT.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.221
YOU LITTLE SHIT,
YOU DON'T MAKE JOKES !

16:03.330 --> 16:05.480
YOU TAKE THIS
SERIOUSLY.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.320
I'D FLIP YOU OVER
sAND SPANK YOUR CANDY ASS

16:08.430 --> 16:10.364
'TIL IT BLED IF I DIDN'T
THINK YOU'D LIKE IT SO MUCH.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.667
I WON'T, I PROMISE
I WON'T LIKE IT.

16:13.770 --> 16:14.930
NICE TRY.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.189
( doorbell )

16:17.940 --> 16:19.305
HUH.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.235
I WONDER
WHO THAT IS ?

16:23.780 --> 16:26.374
HEY, SHUT THE DOOR.

16:26.480 --> 16:31.179
WHAT, YOU DON'T WANT SOMEBODY TO
SEE YOU ALL TIED UP LIKE THIS ?

16:31.290 --> 16:34.009
TOO BAD, BECAUSE I WANT
THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE

16:34.120 --> 16:36.782
WHAT A TWISTED SISTER
YOU ARE.

16:36.890 --> 16:38.687
FREAK.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.119
HEY.

16:42.230 --> 16:43.527
HI.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.564
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
UP FOR GRABBING A MOVIE

16:45.670 --> 16:48.867
OR A BITE
OR SOMETHING ?

16:48.970 --> 16:50.198
OH.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.562
MAYA'S WITH HER AUNT BARB
THEY WENT TO LEGOLAND,

16:52.670 --> 16:55.036
I'M GOING KINDA
STIR CRAZY,

16:56.410 --> 16:58.708
I JUST NEED TO BE
WITH SOMEBODY, I THINK.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.847
I JUST ORDERED OUT
FOR A PIZZA.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.486
THAT'S WHO I
THOUGHT YOU WERE.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.716
THE PIZZA GUY.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.242
I LIKE PIZZA.

17:08.590 --> 17:10.126
UM...

17:15.430 --> 17:16.658
BAD TIMING.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.193
MMM-HMM.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.592
WELL, GUESS I
SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.133
NO, NATE.

17:25.340 --> 17:26.807
STAY.

17:26.910 --> 17:28.434
YOU CAN MEET HIM.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.176
OKAY.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.010
JUST GIVE ME
A FEW MINUTES.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.270
I'M JUST DON'T KNOW IF
HE'S THE RIGHT GUY FOR HER.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.746
AT LEAST HE HAS
SEX WITH HER.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.681
I HAD SEX
WITH HER.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.222
OH RIGHT,
YOU'RE THE STUD,

17:44.330 --> 17:45.957
BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD SEX
WITH MORE WOMEN THAN I HAVE.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.255
WOW, YOU'RE LIKE,
ALMOST HETEROSEXUAL.

17:53.400 --> 17:56.096
WHAT'S UP
WITH YOU ?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.703
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S WEIRD AT WORK.

17:58.810 --> 18:02.234
I FEEL LIKE SARAH JANE
FROM "IMITATION OF LIFE".

18:02.340 --> 18:04.501
THAT MAKES ME
TROY DONAHUE.

18:04.610 --> 18:07.147
OKAY, THIS FITS.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.616
BUT THERE'S THIS SIDE OF ME
THAT FEELS ALL PUFFED UP

18:09.720 --> 18:13.508
BECAUSE EVERYBODY
THINKS I'M STRAIGHT,

18:13.620 --> 18:16.088
IT'S LIKE I FEEL LIKE I'M
15 YEARS OLD ALL OVER AGAIN.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.350
HOW FUCKED UP
IS THAT ?

18:17.460 --> 18:18.825
IN A CULTURE THAT
CONSISTENTLY PUFFS UP MEN

18:18.930 --> 18:19.680
FOR BEING STRAIGHT ?

18:19.790 --> 18:21.052
NOT VERY.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.128
BUT, KEITH,
YOU HAVE TO COME OUT.

18:23.230 --> 18:24.788
DAVID,
THAT'S MY DECISION.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.733
YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON
I EVER EXPECTED TO TURN INTO

18:27.840 --> 18:29.159
A SELF-LOATHING HOMO.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.830
( phone ringing )

18:31.940 --> 18:34.602
WAIT, I'LL GET THAT.

18:35.910 --> 18:37.571
KEITH CHARLES...

18:37.680 --> 18:39.500
DUANE, WHAT UP ?

18:40.820 --> 18:43.846
11A.M., I KNOW...

18:43.950 --> 18:46.009
UH, TWO VENTI
SOY LATTES.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.486
YEAH, LATER.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.523
BITCH .

18:52.630 --> 18:55.053
JUST BECAUSE I'M THE NEW GUY,
I'M THEIR FUCKING WAITRESS ?

18:55.160 --> 18:56.889
SO NOW I CAN'T ANSWER
THE PHONE IN MY OWN HOUSE ?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.365
NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.928
I'LL JUST MAKE SURE THEY
ALWAYS CALL ME ON MY CELL.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.337
DAVID, LOOK IF THEY
TAKE ME ON TOUR

19:03.440 --> 19:05.032
I CAN MAKE 100 FUCKING
BUCKS AN HOUR, OKAY ?

19:05.140 --> 19:07.108
AND THAT'S FOR US !

19:07.210 --> 19:08.905
( beeping )

19:10.650 --> 19:13.448
BUT WE CAN'T COME TO THE PHONE
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'RE TOO GAY.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.423
SO AFTER WATCHING
THIS THING LIKE 100 TIMES

19:25.530 --> 19:27.327
I DECIDE I'M GONNA DO
THE SCARECROW FOR HER.

19:27.430 --> 19:30.297
SO I'M DANCING AROUND,
DOING THE THING

19:30.400 --> 19:32.391
AND THROWING MYSELF
AROUND LIKE A RAG DOLL

19:32.500 --> 19:33.899
AND SHE'S LAUGHING
HER HEAD OFF,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.434
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW
SHE STARTS DOING THE SAME THING,

19:36.540 --> 19:37.700
AND SHE'S THROWING
HERSELF AROUND

19:37.810 --> 19:39.562
AND I CAN JUST SEE HER
CRACKING HER HEAD OPEN

19:39.670 --> 19:41.308
ON THE EDGE OF A COFFEE
TABLE OR SOMETHING

19:41.410 --> 19:43.401
AND THAT'S HOW
YOU GO FROM

19:43.510 --> 19:45.546
FEELING LIKE YOU'RE SUPER DAD
TO THE VILLAGE FUCKING IDIOT.

19:45.650 --> 19:48.346
PARENTHOOD IS JUST SUCH A
HUGFUCKING RESPONSIBILITY.

19:48.450 --> 19:52.682
AREN'T YOU
EVER TERRIFIED ?

19:52.790 --> 19:58.126
YEAH, BUT I JUST REMIND MYSELF
THAT SOME THINGS IN MY LIFE

19:58.230 --> 20:01.393
I JUST DON'T HAVE ANY
POWER OVER AND I NEVER WILL.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.293
BECAUSE FEAR
IS NO GOOD.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.937
FEAR CAN TAKE OVER
YOUR LIFE.

20:10.270 --> 20:13.239
I STILL FEEL LIKE
LISA'S AROUND...

20:16.110 --> 20:18.442
PUSHING ME
TO MOVE ON,

20:19.150 --> 20:21.368
WANTS ME TO...

20:23.450 --> 20:25.884
BUT YOU CAN'T,
YOU CAN'T RUSH IT.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.319
UH, I SHOULD GO.

20:39.130 --> 20:40.336
NICE TO
MEET YOU, JOE.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.089
YEAH, YOU TOO,
TAKE CARE.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.963
ARE YOU ALRIGHT
TO DRIVE ?

20:44.070 --> 20:44.866
YEAH, YEAH.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.198
OKAY.

20:46.310 --> 20:47.436
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS
THE ONLY ONE DRINKING,

20:47.540 --> 20:49.599
YOU GUYS MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE SUCH A LOWLIFE.

20:49.710 --> 20:51.746
WELL, BE GOOD
TO YOURSELF.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.579
YEAH, OKAY,
I WILL.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.417
THAT GUY IS
SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.681
I WANT TO PUT ONE OF THOSE
LAMP SHADES AROUND HIS HEAD,

21:01.790 --> 21:03.189
YOU KNOW, LIKE
THEY PUT ON DOGS

21:03.290 --> 21:05.429
SO THEY DON'T CHEW
THEIR STITCHES ?

21:05.530 --> 21:09.489
I KNOW, I FELT LIKE
I COULDN'T TURN HIM AWAY.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.760
SORRY.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.668
NO, NO, NO, NO, I LOVED
HAVING YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND

21:13.770 --> 21:15.192
INVITED IN WHEN
I'M TRUSSED UP

21:15.300 --> 21:17.165
IN THE OTHER ROOM
LIKE A CHRISTMAS HAM.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.704
YEAH.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.732
THAT'S HOT.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.171
REALLY ?

21:23.280 --> 21:25.339
VERY HOT.

21:55.710 --> 21:56.870
HEY, BUDDY.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.948
WELL, HELLO.

22:01.150 --> 22:02.845
WHATCHA DOIN' ?

22:06.350 --> 22:07.715
SO LON

22:07.820 --> 22:10.789
( barking )

22:17.130 --> 22:18.995
WHAT IS IT ?

22:19.100 --> 22:20.294
HEY, BUDDY BOY.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.197
WHAT'S UP, HUH ?

22:22.300 --> 22:24.666
HI YA DOIN', HUH ?

22:26.710 --> 22:28.177
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING, HUH ?

22:28.280 --> 22:31.772
( whimpering )

22:35.880 --> 22:37.848
LISA ?

22:44.230 --> 22:45.288
OH.

22:45.390 --> 22:46.948
UH-OH, INCOMING.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.049
IS CELESTE
IN THERE ?

22:48.160 --> 22:49.092
WHO WANTS
TO KNOW ?

22:49.200 --> 22:50.189
NANCY FREYMIRE.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.665
I'M CHAIRWOMAN
OF THIS EVENT ?

22:51.770 --> 22:53.795
PLEASE, STAND BACK
FROM THE DOOR.

22:54.470 --> 22:56.563
( knocking )

23:00.580 --> 23:02.275
HI CELESTE, I'M--

23:02.380 --> 23:03.506
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.500
I BRING MY OWN HAIR
AND MAKEUP PEOPLE,

23:06.610 --> 23:08.043
IT'S IN
MY CONTRACT.

23:08.150 --> 23:10.789
YES, BUT WE WERE UNAWARE THAT
THERE WOULD BE A $3,000 FEE--

23:10.890 --> 23:13.882
HEY, THESE PEOPLE
WORK HARD.

23:13.990 --> 23:16.857
WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING
TO RAISE MONEY FOR PEOPLE

23:16.960 --> 23:18.723
WITH ANTICOAGULATIVE
BLOOD DISORDERS.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.752
RIGHT, AND THAT'S WHY
I AM HERE FOR FREE.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.350
I'M TOTALLY
COMMITTED TO THIS.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.769
LUCIEN AND PHYLLIS, HOWEVER,
ARE NOT AS RICH AS I AM

23:24.870 --> 23:26.929
AND THEREFORE CANNOT
AFFORD TO WORK FOR FREE.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.588
PERHAPS A MORE
REASONABLE--

23:28.700 --> 23:31.100
THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE
RESOLVED BEFORE I GO ON STAGE,

23:31.210 --> 23:32.336
ALRIGHT ?

23:32.440 --> 23:35.034
OTHERWISE
I DON'T.

23:35.140 --> 23:37.233
FINE, BUT MIGHT
I JUST SAY,

23:37.340 --> 23:40.400
I THINK YOU'RE
A GIGANTIC BITCH,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.340
AND I WILL NO LONGER
ALLOW MY DAUGHTERS

23:42.450 --> 23:44.486
TO LISTEN
TO YOUR MUSIC.

23:45.350 --> 23:46.817
I'M SORRY.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.911
YOU'RE EITHER TRYING TO WEASEL
OUT OF WHAT YOU AGREED TO,

23:49.020 --> 23:50.920
OR WERE TOO STUPID
TO EVEN READ IT,

23:51.030 --> 23:52.884
AND I'M THE BITCH ?

23:54.460 --> 23:56.018
TROLLOP.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.928
JESUS, SOME PEOPLE
ARE TENSE.

24:03.140 --> 24:04.539
KEITH.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.631
THAT'S RIGHT.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.207
YOU PEED
IN MY JOHN.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.301
I DID AND
I APOLOGIZE.

24:10.410 --> 24:13.846
I USED TO BE A COP,
I'M KINDA NEW TO THIS.

24:13.950 --> 24:17.078
I'M A LITTLE WEIRD
ABOUT MY BATHROOM.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.626
( snickering )

24:27.730 --> 24:30.563
WHAT THE HELL
IS SO FUNNY ?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.968
SORRY, I CAN'T
HEAR YOU.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.937
YOU GOT YOUR HEAD
SO FAR UP CELESTE'S ASS.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.463
IT IS NOT !

24:45.150 --> 24:46.845
TSK.

24:50.220 --> 24:53.246
( pounding )

25:28.220 --> 25:30.279
( barking )

25:32.560 --> 25:35.097
GOOD BOY.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.667
I'VE BEEN
EXPECTING YOU.

25:41.770 --> 25:43.328
I HAVE MANY
MESSAGES FOR YOU.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.500
OH YEAH ?

25:46.610 --> 25:48.009
YEAH, WHAT'S MY NAME ?

25:48.110 --> 25:51.944
THEY DON'T TELL ME YOUR NAME,
JUST THAT YOU'VE LOST A LOT,

25:52.050 --> 25:54.143
AND THAT YOUR HEART
HAS BEEN BROKEN.

25:56.750 --> 25:59.548
YEAH, WHO'S "THEY" ?

25:59.650 --> 26:02.289
AN OLDER MAN
WHO WATCHES OVER YOU.

26:02.390 --> 26:04.551
YOUR FATHER ?
YOUR GRANDFATHER ?

26:04.660 --> 26:07.549
HE WAS VERY
UNHAPPY IN LIFE.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.457
THE OTHER ONE IS
A WOMAN, I THINK.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.391
CAN'T BE SURE.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.762
SIT !

26:13.700 --> 26:16.760
( bird chirping & tv playing )

26:28.320 --> 26:29.810
AH.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.447
YOU HAVE A LOT
TO WORK OUT IN THIS LIFE.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.484
TOO MUCH
FOR ONE LIFE.

26:35.590 --> 26:38.127
YOU WILL HAVE
MANY LIVES.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.879
RIGHT.

26:39.990 --> 26:42.720
LISTEN, I THINK
I OUGHTTA GO, NO OFFENSE,

26:42.830 --> 26:44.525
I JUST THINK THIS IS
A HUGE BALL OF CRAP.

26:44.630 --> 26:47.838
SHE'S NOT GONE.

26:47.940 --> 26:53.060
SHE'S TRYING TO GET TO YOU,
SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

26:53.170 --> 26:54.330
SHE'S--

26:54.440 --> 26:56.772
WHO IS ?

26:56.880 --> 27:02.375
I SEE A WOMAN,
I SEE WATER.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.710
SHE THINKS YOU
STOPPED LOVING HER.

27:04.820 --> 27:09.211
BUT I ONLY STARTED
LOVING HER...

27:11.490 --> 27:13.651
I WANTED TO LOVE HER,

27:13.760 --> 27:17.924
THE WAY SHE DESERVED
TO BE LOVED.

27:18.030 --> 27:19.964
YOU STILL CAN.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.038
SHE'S DEAD--

27:22.140 --> 27:23.437
SHE ISN'T DEAD.

27:23.540 --> 27:26.008
SHE'S TRYING
TO GET BACK TO YOU.

27:26.110 --> 27:29.238
SHE LOVES YOU.

27:36.750 --> 27:40.538
( chatter)

27:40.650 --> 27:43.687
( whispering )
If you even tried to understand
what I'm going through--

27:43.790 --> 27:46.884
I am trying,
but it's never enough !

27:52.500 --> 27:54.434
( sobbing )

28:11.020 --> 28:13.181
MY OLDER BROTHER
DIES WHEN I'M 10,

28:13.290 --> 28:19.581
MY MOTHER DEVELOPS
ALZHEIMER'S REALLY EARLY,

28:19.690 --> 28:22.193
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE
TURNS OUT TO BE GAY,

28:22.300 --> 28:26.418
AND MY DAD GETS
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.468
WHY DID ALL THIS
HAPPEN TO ME ?

28:35.340 --> 28:37.843
I DON'T KNOW.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.178
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT YOU--

28:41.280 --> 28:44.078
DON'T YOU FUCKING
TAKE MY HAND.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.640
ARE YOU SERIOUS ?

28:47.760 --> 28:50.957
YOU FUCKING BROKE MY HEART
AND STOMPED ON IT.

28:51.060 --> 28:54.052
AND I WAS SUCH
A FUCKING IDIOT,

28:54.160 --> 28:56.549
I WENT OUT OF MY WAY
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU ?!

28:56.660 --> 29:00.221
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO SUCK COCK !

29:00.330 --> 29:02.662
I WAS SO FUCKING
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

29:02.770 --> 29:04.203
YOU FUCKING SADIST !

29:04.310 --> 29:06.198
YOU MAKE ME SICK !

29:08.740 --> 29:10.207
I HATE THAT
YOU'RE GAY.

29:11.380 --> 29:13.268
I FUCKING HATE IT.

29:15.580 --> 29:17.218
( sobbing )

29:24.730 --> 29:26.083
YOU DON'T HATE
THAT I'M GAY.

29:26.190 --> 29:28.021
YOU HATE THAT
I LIED TO YOU.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.994
YOU SHOULD
HATE THAT.

29:39.670 --> 29:42.036
I LIED
TO MYSELF TOO.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.356
ARE YOU SURE
YOU LIKE IT ?

29:58.460 --> 30:00.621
HOW COULD I NOT LIKE
THE FIRST PIECE OF FURNITURE

30:00.730 --> 30:03.290
WE'VE PURCHASED
TOGETHER AS A COUPLE ?

30:03.400 --> 30:06.392
IT'LL BE NICE TO HAVE A PLACE
TO DISPLAY MY ROCK COLLECTION.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.828
I SPOKE
TO A LAWYER TODAY

30:14.940 --> 30:16.908
ABOUT PRESSING CHARGES
AGAINST ARTHUR.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.302
OH SHIT.

30:20.880 --> 30:21.869
LOOK, RUTH.

30:21.980 --> 30:24.187
ARTHUR NEVER SENT US
ANY EXCREMENT.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.042
THEN WHO DID ?

30:26.150 --> 30:27.378
MY SON.

30:27.490 --> 30:29.378
THAT TOY TRUCK WAS
SOMETHING I BOUGHT HIM.

30:29.490 --> 30:32.027
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I EVER BOUGHT HIM ACTUALLY,

30:32.130 --> 30:33.757
BEFORE HE WAS
EVEN BORN.

30:33.860 --> 30:34.758
BRIAN ?

30:34.860 --> 30:36.623
KYLE.

30:36.730 --> 30:38.869
I THOUGHT YOUR SON'S
NAME WAS BRIAN.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.267
I HAVE ANOTHER SON.

30:43.170 --> 30:44.899
WHY HAVE YOU
NEVER TOLD ME THIS ?

30:45.010 --> 30:47.069
BECAUSE HE'S NEVER REALLY
BEEN PART OF MY LIFE.

30:47.170 --> 30:49.104
IF HE'S SENDING US
SHIT IN THE MAIL,

30:49.210 --> 30:50.734
HE'S A PART
OF YOUR LIFE.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.171
NO, HE ISN'T--

30:52.280 --> 30:55.670
I WAS VERY YOUNG, HIS MOTHER
AND I NEVER EVEN MARRIED,

30:55.780 --> 30:57.839
HER FAMILY DIDN'T
THINK I WAS SUITABLE.

30:57.950 --> 30:59.315
SO YOU JUST LEFT ?

30:59.420 --> 31:00.717
HE WASN'T BORN YET.

31:00.820 --> 31:02.913
I WAS VERY YOUNG.

31:03.020 --> 31:05.454
NOBODY WANTED ME
TO BE A PART OF HIS LIFE.

31:07.560 --> 31:11.064
ARE THERE OTHER WIVES YOU'VE
NEGLECTED TO TELL ME ABOUT ?

31:11.170 --> 31:12.319
NO.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.261
OF COURSE NOT.

31:16.900 --> 31:18.902
ART IS JUST
A SENTIMENTAL CONSTRUCT

31:19.010 --> 31:20.978
TO ALLEVIATE
OUR FEAR OF DEATH.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.036
NO, THERE'S NO WAY TO EVEN
DETERMINE WHAT IT IS

31:23.140 --> 31:28.009
THAT MAKES ART ART,
MUCH LESS TO TEACH IT.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.283
IT'S A GODDAMN ILLUSION THAT
ANYONE CAN BE TAUGHT ANYTHING.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.517
I MEAN, YES, WE CAN BE
CONDITIONED UP THE WAZOO,

31:33.620 --> 31:36.817
BUT TO REALLY LEARN SOMETHING,
SOMETHING IMPORTANT ?

31:36.920 --> 31:38.387
THAT ALWAYS
COMES FROM WITHIN.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.481
THE CUNT HAS SPOKEN.

31:40.590 --> 31:42.694
( laughing )

31:42.800 --> 31:45.621
AND NOW THE WORLD
SITS IN SILENCE.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.391
SO, WHY DO YOU
TEACH ART, THEN ?

31:49.500 --> 31:50.637
WHY ?

31:50.740 --> 31:53.504
BECAUSE I NEED
A GODDAMN PAYCHECK.

31:53.610 --> 31:54.804
NO, YOU DON'T, BABY.

31:54.910 --> 31:57.299
BERN LEFT ME VERY
WELL-TAKEN CARE OF.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.275
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
JUST KEEP MAKING PAINTINGS

31:59.380 --> 32:02.042
AND I'LL KEEP
BUYING THEM.

32:02.150 --> 32:05.608
DID YOU KNOW OLIVIER
TAUGHT MY SON !

32:05.720 --> 32:07.642
I'M HOT
FOR TEACHER.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.182
DRINK MORE, MOM.

32:10.290 --> 32:12.485
OH DARLING, DON'T YOU
WANT TO TRY THE SHIRAZ ?

32:12.590 --> 32:13.784
IT'S DELICIOUS.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.118
NO, I'M GOOD.

32:15.230 --> 32:18.097
I READ IN THE PAPER
ABOUT A STUDENT WHO ALLOWED

32:18.200 --> 32:20.919
SOME CORPORATION TO TATTOO
ITS LOGO ON HIS FOREHEAD,

32:21.040 --> 32:23.895
AND IN EXCHANGE,
THEY PAID FOR HIS EDUCATION.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.432
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT ?

32:25.540 --> 32:28.509
I IMAGINE IT'S AN EDUCATION
FOR SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T

32:28.610 --> 32:30.669
NORMALLY BE ABLE
TO PAY FOR IT HIMSELF.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.304
IT'S WAY
MORE THAN THAT.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.571
MY STUDENTS ARE ALL
IN SUCH A MAD RUSH

32:34.680 --> 32:36.011
TO BECOME COMMODITIES.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.384
BUT THAT'S ALWAYS
BEEN TRUE OF ARTISTS.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.481
WHERE IS
YOUR BATHROOM ?

32:45.590 --> 32:46.727
STRAIGHT
THROUGH THERE,

32:46.830 --> 32:48.695
TO THE LEFT.

32:52.700 --> 32:53.792
IT'S HIM !

32:53.900 --> 32:56.562
HE'S THE ONE,
I CAN FEEL IT.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.001
HE'S THE ONE !

32:58.110 --> 32:59.236
YOU'RE DRUNK.

32:59.340 --> 33:02.138
NOW, ISN'T IT NICE
TO HAVE SOMEONE

33:02.240 --> 33:04.049
WHO'S NOT ONLY
GREAT IN BED,

33:04.150 --> 33:06.277
BUT WHO'S ALSO YOUR
INTELLECTUAL EQUAL ?

33:09.320 --> 33:12.448
JUST DON'T FUCK IT UP
THIS TIME, LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

33:12.550 --> 33:14.256
HMM.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.988
WHAT IF SHE'S
REALLY NOT DEAD ?!

33:17.090 --> 33:19.650
NATE, THEY IDENTIFIED
HER TEETH.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.125
YEAH, I KNOW
THEY DID.

33:21.230 --> 33:22.822
BUT WHAT IF, BY SOME
AMAZING COINCIDENCE,

33:22.930 --> 33:24.761
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE
WHO HAD THE EXACT THE SAME WORK

33:24.870 --> 33:26.622
DONE TO HER LOWER
JAW AS LISA ?

33:26.730 --> 33:28.539
I SUPPOSE THAT
COULD BE POSSIBLE,

33:28.640 --> 33:30.232
BUT I REALLY THINK
THE CHANCES ARE PRETTY REMOTE.

33:30.340 --> 33:32.069
BUT IT COULD BE
POSSIBLE, RIGHT ?

33:32.170 --> 33:34.001
ARE YOU HIGH ?

33:34.110 --> 33:36.169
NO, I'M NOT,
NOT ANYMORE.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.748
( cell phone )
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
LIKE, STAY IN TONIGHT

33:38.850 --> 33:40.499
AND TRY
TO CHILL OUT.

33:40.610 --> 33:42.146
OKAY, I'VE TO GO.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.980
I'VE GOT A DATE WITH
THE MATTHEW BARNEY
OF LAC-ARTS.

33:45.090 --> 33:48.287
EVEN THOUGH I'M SO NOT
THE BJORK OF LAC-ARTS.

33:51.690 --> 33:54.523
All the chicks are
hatched and fluffy now.

33:54.630 --> 33:58.191
Listen to them,
cheep, cheep, cheep.

34:01.470 --> 34:05.304
Make the chick sound,
cheep, cheep, cheep.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.783
HEY, BABY,
I MADE SOME ASOPAO.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.085
ARE YOU HUNGRY ?

34:22.890 --> 34:24.551
AW, DAMN.

34:24.660 --> 34:26.651
I HAD A SANDWICH
AT WORK.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.690
WHERE ARE
THE KIDS ?

34:34.800 --> 34:36.495
'GUSTO'S IN BED,

34:36.600 --> 34:38.602
JULIO'S SPENDING THE NIGHT
OVER AT CHARLIE'S HOUSE.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.598
HMM.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.744
I LOVE YOU,
VAN ESSA.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.072
I KNOW THAT.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.475
TELL ME
WHAT YOU LIKE.

35:16.580 --> 35:17.899
I LIKE YOU.

35:21.850 --> 35:26.184
UH, JUST DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT,

35:26.290 --> 35:27.882
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW
HOW IT WORKS OUT FOR ME.

35:27.990 --> 35:31.221
WHY WON'T YOU
TELL ME ?

35:31.760 --> 35:32.852
LOOK.

35:32.960 --> 35:36.623
I DON'T HAVE LIKE A CHECKLIST
I NEED TO GO THROUGH.

35:41.670 --> 35:43.763
( giggling )

35:43.870 --> 35:45.235
DO YOU LIKE TO HAVE
YOUR NIPPLES PLAYED WITH ?

35:45.340 --> 35:47.831
NOT IF WE HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT !

35:51.280 --> 35:53.441
HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHAT TO DO HERE, CLAIRE ?

35:53.550 --> 35:56.314
ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU DON'T ?

35:58.520 --> 36:01.455
OKAY, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST GO TO THE MOVIE.

36:11.930 --> 36:13.795
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GO HOME.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.763
ALRIGHT.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.886
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
LEARN ANYTHING, SWEETIE.

36:34.990 --> 36:36.548
NOT IN THAT PROGRAM.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.823
WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY LEARN
ABOUT COUNSELING IN 18 MONTHS ?

36:39.930 --> 36:43.923
WELL, AFTER A LIFETIME OF
LEARNING HOW NOT TO DO THINGS,

36:44.030 --> 36:45.793
MAYBE I'M A LITTLE
AHEAD OF THE GAME.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.198
I JUST STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'RE PLANNING ON

36:48.300 --> 36:49.836
BECOMING A SHRINK.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.089
THE IRONY ?

36:51.200 --> 36:53.407
IT'S SUPERB.

36:53.510 --> 36:56.035
THE REAL IRONY IS THAT
SHRINKS ARE WHO WE HIRE

36:56.140 --> 36:57.801
TO STRAIGHTEN OUT
OUR LIVES,

36:57.910 --> 37:01.277
BUT INVARIABLY, THEY ARE THE
ONES WHO ARE THE MOST FUCKED UP.

37:01.380 --> 37:02.870
I MEAN, TWISTED.

37:02.980 --> 37:04.140
DEMONIC.

37:04.250 --> 37:05.387
OOH.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.913
WELL, THEN IT MAKES
ABSOLUTE SENSE

37:08.020 --> 37:09.908
THAT BRENDA
WOULD BECOME ONE.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.352
( laughing )

37:12.460 --> 37:14.394
OH, HONEY,
COME ON NOW.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.991
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE A GOOD
SHRINK WITHOUT A SENSE OF HUMOR.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.091
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
A GOOD SHRINK ?

37:19.200 --> 37:20.690
I THINK I'M A VERY
GOOD SHRINK.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.734
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE VERY FUCKED UP ?

37:22.840 --> 37:24.159
ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY.

37:24.270 --> 37:26.500
OH, YOU HAVE
NO IDEA.

37:31.240 --> 37:35.040
DARLING, DO YOU
EVER HEAR FROM NATE ?

37:35.150 --> 37:37.869
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
WE SAW HIM LAST NIGHT.

37:37.980 --> 37:40.119
HE'S STILL
GRIEVING.

37:40.220 --> 37:42.188
OH, HE SHOWED US
PICTURES OF HIS DAUGHTER,

37:42.290 --> 37:44.053
OH, MY GOD,
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.652
THOSE EYES,
SO OPEN AND TRUSTING,

37:47.760 --> 37:50.888
IT'S MIND-BOGGLING TO THINK
THAT WE WERE ALL LIKE THAT ONCE.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.889
IGET IT!

37:54.000 --> 37:56.195
NOW THIS
MAKES SENSE.

37:56.300 --> 37:58.359
YOU WANT A BABY !

37:58.470 --> 38:02.236
WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM ?

38:02.340 --> 38:04.479
COME ON, DARLING,
YOU ARE GETTING

38:04.580 --> 38:06.138
A LITTLE LONG IN
THE TOOTH, YOU KNOW.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.308
THIS WOULD BE
THE TIME.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.072
AW, BRENDA'S
FEELING EGGY.

38:10.180 --> 38:13.843
OKAY, WELL, IT'S TIME
FOR US TO GO.

38:13.950 --> 38:17.056
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.559
NICE MEETING
YOU, JIM.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.924
I HOPE YOU'RE UP FOR
THE CHALLENGE OF MY DAUGHTER.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.327
IAM.

38:22.430 --> 38:26.059
AND IT'S JOE
NOT JIM.

38:26.170 --> 38:27.922
BYE, SEE YOU
IN A FEW YEARS.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.863
TERRIBLE EVENING.

38:33.670 --> 38:34.773
OH!

38:38.140 --> 38:41.769
( snoring )

38:59.770 --> 39:01.362
WHAT ?

39:02.240 --> 39:03.559
WHAT TIME IS IT ?

39:03.670 --> 39:06.332
TIME FOR YOU TO STOP
KEEPING THINGS FROM ME !

39:07.040 --> 39:09.634
OH, RUTH.

39:09.740 --> 39:12.800
IT SOUNDS ABSURD
WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.712
OKAY.

39:20.820 --> 39:25.359
MMM.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.721
I WAS JUST
A GRAD STUDENT.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.295
AND I...

39:33.400 --> 39:35.766
ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKED UP
A YOUNG WOMAN

39:35.870 --> 39:37.360
FROM A VERY
WEALTHY FAMILY,

39:37.470 --> 39:39.404
I OFFERED
TO MARRY HER,

39:39.510 --> 39:42.502
HER FAMILY WAS
DEAD SET AGAINST IT,

39:42.610 --> 39:46.205
SO, I SIGNED
SOMETHING,

39:46.310 --> 39:49.575
AND WE BOTH WENT ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.439
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO ?

39:53.550 --> 39:56.155
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
SEEN THIS CHILD ?

39:57.290 --> 40:00.748
OH YEAH,
I'VE SEEN HIM.

40:00.860 --> 40:04.352
HE TRACKED ME DOWN
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.097
HE WAS LIVING IN SOME
MOTEL OVER IN BURBANK.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.065
AND... ?

40:09.900 --> 40:13.301
I DIDN'T PARTICULARLY
CARE FOR HIM.

40:13.410 --> 40:16.470
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I FOUND HIM VERY UNPLEASANT.

40:16.580 --> 40:20.038
AND I ASSUMED HE NEVER
WANTED TO SEE ME AGAIN.

40:20.150 --> 40:21.572
WHY ?

40:21.680 --> 40:26.219
BECAUSE HE SAID, "I DON'T
EVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN."

40:26.320 --> 40:29.585
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING ?

40:30.420 --> 40:33.059
I'M GOING
TO THE BATHROOM.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.094
GEORGE,
HOW CAN YOU--

40:35.200 --> 40:36.451
I JUST DON'T
SEE HOW--

40:36.560 --> 40:39.165
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T
KNOW YOU AT ALL.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.623
RUTH, PLEASE.

40:40.730 --> 40:44.439
DON'T BLOW THIS ALL
OUT OF PROPORTION.

40:44.540 --> 40:47.168
IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR EITHER ONE OF US.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.798
( gasping )

41:10.930 --> 41:12.124
OH GOD.

41:24.180 --> 41:30.471
( phone ringing )

41:34.450 --> 41:35.678
HELLO ?

41:35.790 --> 41:36.950
Nate ?

41:37.060 --> 41:38.015
BARB ?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.326
It's Lisa.

41:39.430 --> 41:41.318
WHERE ARE YOU ?

41:41.430 --> 41:42.727
I don't know,
they won't tell me.

41:42.830 --> 41:44.798
WELL, WHO WON'T
TELL YOU ?

41:44.900 --> 41:47.164
Nate, the number three
is not important.

41:47.270 --> 41:49.261
WAIT, WHAT ?

41:49.370 --> 41:50.769
You buried me.

41:50.870 --> 41:52.406
How could you
bury me ?

41:52.510 --> 41:55.104
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED.

41:55.210 --> 41:56.837
But I'm not dead.

41:56.940 --> 41:59.249
( barking )

42:07.590 --> 42:08.955
I DON'T THINK
IT'S HEALTHY,

42:09.060 --> 42:11.312
BEING SO DISCONNECTED
FROM YOUR OWN SON.

42:11.420 --> 42:13.058
THAT'S WHY
I CALLED HIM THIS MORNING,

42:13.160 --> 42:14.752
AND TOLD HIM TO BE
EXPECTING US SHORTLY PAST NOON.

42:14.860 --> 42:17.158
I'M LUCKY HIS NUMBER
WAS IN YOU ADDRESS BOOK--

42:17.260 --> 42:20.696
YOU LOOKED IN ADDRESS BOOK,
WITHOUT ASKING ME ?

42:20.800 --> 42:21.767
RUTH !

42:21.870 --> 42:22.837
THIS IS IMPORTANT
TO ME, GEORGE.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.601
I DO NOT ASK YOU
FOR MANY THINGS.

42:28.170 --> 42:29.637
ALRIGHT.

42:36.380 --> 42:37.642
YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.411
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.942
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

42:41.050 --> 42:42.551
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
VERY GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.821
WELL, I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN, MOM.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.283
YOU POINTING OUT
THE WAYS I'M FAILING

42:46.390 --> 42:48.119
DOESN'T NECESSARILY HELP.

42:50.760 --> 42:53.194
I'LL BE WAITING
FOR YOU IN THE CAR.

43:00.340 --> 43:02.399
NATE, CAN I ASK
YOU SOMETHING ?

43:02.510 --> 43:04.808
NOW MAY NOT BE
THE BEST TIME, GEORGE.

43:06.050 --> 43:08.143
HAS YOUR MOTHER
ALWAYS BEEN SO...

43:08.250 --> 43:10.218
ANXIOUS ABOUT
EVERYTHING ?

43:12.190 --> 43:14.909
PRETTY MUCH.

43:15.020 --> 43:17.352
SHE'S GOTTEN A LOT BETTER
SINCE YOU TWO GOT MARRIED.

43:18.660 --> 43:20.582
HOW'D YOU
DEAL WITH HER ?

43:20.690 --> 43:24.558
I MOVED AWAY
WHEN I WAS 17.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.524
FOR NONE OF US
LIVETH TO HIMSELF,

43:26.630 --> 43:28.666
AND NO MAN DIETH
TO HIMSELF.

43:28.770 --> 43:31.933
FOR IF WE LIVE,
WE LIVE UNTO THE LORD.

43:32.040 --> 43:35.373
AND IF WE DIE,
WE DIE UNTO THE LORD.

43:37.210 --> 43:40.373
( cell phone vibrating )

43:43.520 --> 43:48.958
EVEN SO SAYETH THE SPIRIT,
FOR THEY REST FROM THEIR LABORS.

43:49.060 --> 43:50.379
WHAT ?!

43:50.490 --> 43:52.458
( Sophia )
That's not a very nice
way to answer the phone.

43:52.560 --> 43:54.152
THIS IS STARTING
TO GET WEIRD, OKAY ?

43:54.260 --> 43:56.399
YOU ARE NOT
MY WIFE.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.061
I KNOW THAT.

43:59.170 --> 44:01.058
AND I DO NOT WANT YOU
CALLING ME ALL THE TIME.

44:01.170 --> 44:02.296
YOU GOT THAT ?

44:02.400 --> 44:05.267
OF COURSE,
I'M SORRY.

44:05.370 --> 44:07.759
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT I...

44:09.140 --> 44:12.769
I DON'T EVER WANT
TO BE A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

44:18.950 --> 44:21.612
GEORGE, I HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.178
AND I WANT YOU
TO ANSWER ME HONESTLY.

44:25.290 --> 44:28.054
RUTH, I GET THE FEELING
YOU THINK I HAVEN'T BEEN

44:28.160 --> 44:30.128
HONEST WITH YOU,
BUT I ALWAYS HAVE.

44:30.230 --> 44:32.562
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BURDEN YOU WITH THINGS

44:32.670 --> 44:34.467
THAT DON'T MATTER,
THAT'S ALL.

44:34.570 --> 44:37.164
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD
WANT FROM YOU.

44:41.570 --> 44:43.379
WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO ASK ME ?

44:45.110 --> 44:47.101
I HAVE NO IDEA.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.368
WE JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.788
OF COURSE.

44:52.890 --> 44:54.858
SERIOUSLY, MAN,
THAN KS.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.656
JEN TOLD ME HOW
SHE UNLEASHED ON YOU,

44:57.760 --> 44:59.887
I THINK SHE REALLY
NEEDED TO DO THAT.

44:59.990 --> 45:02.254
SHE'S BEEN DOING IT
TO ME, MOSTLY.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.760
WHICH WAS JUST MAKING IT HARDER
FOR HIM TO BE THERE FOR ME.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.963
YES, THAT'S A...

45:07.070 --> 45:09.288
SCENARIO
I'M FAMILIAR WITH.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.732
THE FUNERAL
WAS AWESOME,

45:11.840 --> 45:14.035
THE OLD GUY WOULD
HAVE REALLY LIKED IT.

45:14.140 --> 45:17.598
OKAY, I'LL GO
GET THE CAR ?

45:17.710 --> 45:19.769
OKAY, THAN KS, HON.

45:23.550 --> 45:26.110
I'M SORRY.

45:26.220 --> 45:28.882
I SAID SOME PRETTY
TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT YOU.

45:28.990 --> 45:30.685
MOST OF WHICH
WERE TRUE.

45:30.790 --> 45:32.018
NO, DAVID.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.690
I KNOW IT WAS
HARD FOR YOU TOO.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.324
PROBABLY EVEN HARDER
THAN IT WAS FOR ME.

45:36.430 --> 45:37.522
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

45:37.630 --> 45:39.393
MAKING IT
EASY FOR ME.

45:42.570 --> 45:44.094
SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.862
YEAH, WE,
SOME THINGS NEED TO.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.885
( music )

46:01.990 --> 46:04.754
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
TELL HIM WHAT YOU WANTED ?

46:04.860 --> 46:07.658
'CAUSE THERE WAS
ABSOLUTELY NO WAY,

46:07.760 --> 46:10.695
I MEAN, IT WOULD
JUST BE TOO...

46:10.800 --> 46:13.462
EW.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.595
SERIOUSLY,
YOU WOULD DO THAT ?

46:15.700 --> 46:16.667
OF COURSE.

46:16.770 --> 46:18.237
YEAH.

46:18.340 --> 46:19.739
OTHERWISE THEY'LL NEVER
FIGURE IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES,

46:19.840 --> 46:21.262
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
PORN STAR SCREAMING I DO.

46:21.370 --> 46:26.239
I JUST WISH THEY KNEW
HOW TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN.

46:26.350 --> 46:27.806
IT'S SO
EM BARRASSING.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.673
WELL, THAT'S WHY
GIRLS ARE BETTER.

46:29.780 --> 46:31.668
THEY KNOW.

46:31.780 --> 46:33.987
NO THANKS,
I LOVE YOU,

46:34.090 --> 46:35.580
BUT I'M NOT INTO
EATING PUSSY, OKAY ?

46:35.690 --> 46:37.157
I TRIED IT ONCE,
IT WAS...

46:37.260 --> 46:38.454
EH, NOT FOR ME.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.619
SO I'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP
TELLING STUPID GUYS POINT BLANK:

46:40.730 --> 46:42.652
LICK MY CLIT
WHILE YOU FINGER ME.

46:42.760 --> 46:45.069
OH MY GOD !

46:48.370 --> 46:49.792
BUT, OKAY.

46:49.900 --> 46:53.404
LAST YEAR, I WENT OUT
WITH THIS GUY PHIL,

46:53.510 --> 46:55.000
HE WAS SO HOT,

46:55.110 --> 46:57.237
AND HE WAS LIKE
SO TOTALLY INTO SEX,

46:57.340 --> 47:01.174
I MEAN, WE WERE ALWAYS FUCKING,
I MEAN, LIKE ALWAYS.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.113
BUT EVERY TIME HE WOULD,
YOU KNOW, GO DOWN ON ME,

47:04.220 --> 47:07.144
IT WAS LIKE THERE WAS
THIS UNSPOKEN TIME LIMIT.

47:07.250 --> 47:10.856
LIKE I KNEW THAT JUST
WHEN IT WAS STARTING

47:10.960 --> 47:12.154
TO GET GOOD FOR ME,

47:12.260 --> 47:13.625
HE WOULD LOOK UP AT ME
WITH THESE LOBSTER EYES,

47:13.730 --> 47:14.958
LIKE, "CAN I
COME UP NOW ?"

47:15.060 --> 47:19.622
SO WHAT MAKES
YOU COME ?

47:19.730 --> 47:22.460
I DON'T KNOW.

47:22.570 --> 47:24.094
THE USUAL STUFF.

47:24.200 --> 47:26.065
WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THIS ?

47:26.170 --> 47:28.138
MAYBE YOU'VE NEVER
HAD AN ORGASM.

47:28.240 --> 47:30.902
OF COURSE
I'VE HAD AN ORGASM.

47:31.010 --> 47:32.500
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD,

47:32.610 --> 47:34.009
YOU WOULDN'T
BE EMBARRASSED

47:34.110 --> 47:37.170
ABOUT ASKING FOR
MORE TONGUE TIME.

47:37.280 --> 47:40.044
COULD I HAVE REALLY
NEVER HAD AN ORGASM ?

47:41.390 --> 47:45.087
I'VE DEFINITELY FELT
A SURGE OF DESIRE...

47:45.190 --> 47:49.320
AND THEN YOU KNOW A SORT OF
RELIEF OF THAT DESIRE.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.563
OH MY GOD, CLAIRE.

47:53.670 --> 47:55.865
HAVE YOU NEVER EVEN
RUBBED ONE OUT ?

47:56.900 --> 47:58.037
YOU DON'T MASTURBATE ?

47:58.140 --> 47:59.607
I DON'T FIND IT
THAT INTERESTING !

47:59.710 --> 48:02.429
YOU KNOW, CLAIRE,

48:02.540 --> 48:07.045
WE COULD SHOW YOU HOW
TO GIVE YOURSELF AN ORGASM

48:07.150 --> 48:08.845
RIGHT NOW
IF YOU WANT.

48:08.950 --> 48:11.646
UM, HELLO,
NOT LESBIANS ?

48:11.750 --> 48:16.687
I REALLY DON'T
THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

48:16.790 --> 48:18.610
THAT I'VE NEVER
HAD AN ORGASM.

48:18.720 --> 48:19.880
WELL, IF YOU HAVEN'T ?

48:19.990 --> 48:22.891
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
MISSING OUT.

48:38.380 --> 48:40.940
I'D LIKE TO SAY GEORGE
HAS TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT YOU,

48:41.050 --> 48:43.473
BUT HE REALLY HASN'T
TOLD ME ANYTHING AT ALL.

48:43.580 --> 48:45.480
THAT'S BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

48:45.590 --> 48:47.148
I KNOW YOU HATE ME,

48:47.250 --> 48:50.083
AND YOU SEEM
TO BLAME ME FOR EVERYTHING

48:50.190 --> 48:51.657
YOU DON'T LIKE
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.681
WHY IS HE HERE ?

48:52.790 --> 48:55.554
OH, THIS WAS
YOUR IDEA.

48:55.660 --> 48:56.820
WELL--

48:56.930 --> 48:58.295
OF COURSE
IT WAS HER IDEA.

48:58.400 --> 48:59.867
YOU MADE IT
PERFECT LY CLEAR

48:59.970 --> 49:01.494
YOU NEVER WANTED
TO SEE ME AGAIN.

49:01.600 --> 49:02.464
I DIDN'T.

49:02.570 --> 49:04.731
THAN KS.

49:04.840 --> 49:05.966
KYLE, LOOK.

49:06.070 --> 49:07.867
WE CAN'T
CHANGE THE PAST.

49:07.970 --> 49:11.701
BUT MAYBE WE CAN
START FRESH, IF YOU'RE--

49:11.810 --> 49:13.368
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU CAN'T DO,

49:13.480 --> 49:15.175
YOU CAN'T WALK IN HERE
AND START SAYING THIS IS THIS,

49:15.280 --> 49:16.474
AND THAT IS THAT,
LIKE YOU'RE GOD !

49:16.580 --> 49:18.172
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT ?
YOU'RE NOT GOD.

49:18.280 --> 49:20.680
YOU'RE NOT
EVEN CLOSE.

49:20.790 --> 49:25.284
I WANT ALL DELIVERIES OF
EXCREMENT TO OUR HOUSE TO CEASE.

49:25.390 --> 49:28.279
YEAH, WELL, I WANT
THERE TO BE WORLD PEACE,

49:28.390 --> 49:30.290
BUT I DON'T SEE THAT
HAPPENING EITHER.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.095
WHY THE HELL ARE
YOU SO ANGRY AT ME ?

49:32.200 --> 49:33.929
IT'S YOUR MOTHER
YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY AT,

49:34.030 --> 49:35.429
AND YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

49:35.540 --> 49:38.498
WHAT IS IT, YOU FIND
MY SHIT OFFENSIVE ?

49:38.600 --> 49:39.703
NO.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.562
I FIND IT CHILDISH,
AND HOSTILE.

49:41.670 --> 49:45.447
AND I'M COMPLETELY
BAFFLED AT THE TIMING.

49:45.550 --> 49:47.370
I MEAN, WHY NOW ?

49:47.480 --> 49:49.675
BECAUSE MY THERAPIST
SAYS I NEED TO EXPRESS

49:49.780 --> 49:51.042
MY TRUE FEELINGS
TO YOU.

49:51.150 --> 49:52.947
THIS IS A GODDAMN
WASTE OF TIME.

49:53.050 --> 49:53.948
GEORGE, PLEASE.

49:54.050 --> 49:56.086
ARE YOU ALRIGHT,
KYLE ?

49:56.190 --> 49:57.657
DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING ?

49:57.760 --> 49:58.818
LIKE WHAT ?

49:58.920 --> 49:59.955
I DON'T KNOW.

50:00.060 --> 50:02.290
CLOTHING,
UNDERWEAR, SOCKS ?

50:02.400 --> 50:03.628
NO.

50:03.730 --> 50:06.790
WOULD YOU LIKE A CAPPUCCINO
FROM MY $7,500 ESPRESSO MACHINE,

50:06.900 --> 50:09.630
WHICH I BOUGHT SO I WOULD NEVER
HAVE TO LEAVE THIS MOTEL ROOM,

50:09.740 --> 50:12.561
BECAUSE I'M SO FUCKING TWISTED
THANKS TO YOU-KNOW-WHO ?

50:14.010 --> 50:16.274
THANK YOU, YES,
I'D LOVE A CAPPUCCINO.

50:17.980 --> 50:19.106
I WAS KIDDING.

50:19.210 --> 50:20.302
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO WORK IT YET.

50:22.880 --> 50:25.041
WELL, WE COULD ALL
GO TO STARBUCKS.

50:30.420 --> 50:31.751
( laughing )

50:31.860 --> 50:34.579
I FEEL SO
SHARON STONE.

50:39.630 --> 50:42.360
DO PEOPLE STILL DO THESE THINGS
WHEN THEY'VE HAD KIDS ?

50:42.470 --> 50:47.806
YEAH, SOME PEOPLE DO,
AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T.

50:48.970 --> 50:50.835
I ONCE WALKED IN
ON MY PARENTS,

50:50.940 --> 50:53.670
MY FATHER WAS
RUBBING A ROLLING PIN

50:53.780 --> 50:55.338
OVER MY MOTHER'S
BREASTS.

50:55.450 --> 50:56.815
HUH.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.615
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'D
LIKE FOR ME TO DO FOR YOU ?

50:58.720 --> 51:00.517
AH, NO THANK YOU.

51:00.620 --> 51:05.182
BUT I MEAN, THAT
FUCKED ME UP MORE THAN

51:05.290 --> 51:09.727
IF THEY'D JUST BEEN
FUCKING IN FRONT OF US.

51:09.830 --> 51:14.221
WHICH THEY ALSO DID,
BY THE WAY.

51:22.380 --> 51:23.677
SORRY.

51:27.280 --> 51:29.441
WELL, THAT WAS FUN.

51:29.550 --> 51:31.609
NO, IT WASN'T.

51:31.720 --> 51:35.850
AND KYLE DELIBERATELY SPILLED
HIS FRAPPUCCINO ALL OVER ME.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.155
NO, IT WAS JUST THAT
HE WAS SO NERVOUS

51:38.260 --> 51:39.329
BEING OUT
IN THE WORLD.

51:39.430 --> 51:41.887
OH, MY HEART
GOES OUT TO HIM.

51:41.990 --> 51:44.857
HE LIVES
IN A MOTEL !

51:44.960 --> 51:47.667
ONLY BECAUSE HE'S TOO DAMN LAZY
TO CHANGE HIS OWN SHEETS.

51:47.770 --> 51:49.533
RUTH.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.938
HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY
COMES FROM MAJOR MONEY,

51:52.040 --> 51:54.099
OLD, OLD MONEY.

51:54.210 --> 51:55.734
HE DOESN'T NEED US.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.377
CHILDREN NEED MORE FROM
THEIR PARENTS THAN MONEY !

51:58.480 --> 52:02.439
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT
I WAS CUT OUT OF HIS LIFE,

52:02.550 --> 52:05.747
BUT THE FACT REMAINS
I WAS CUT OUT OF HIS LIFE.

52:05.850 --> 52:07.715
AND THAT'S NOT
GONNA CHANGE.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.484
HE SEEMS SO LONELY.

52:11.590 --> 52:14.184
MAYBE WE SHOULD
INVITE HIM TO DINNER.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.091
YEAH, SURE.

52:20.200 --> 52:21.861
WHY NOT.

52:32.080 --> 52:34.469
HEY, HOW WAS
THE FUNERAL ?

52:35.180 --> 52:37.341
IT WAS...

52:37.450 --> 52:40.442
"AWESOME, THE OLD GUY
WOULD HAVE LIKED IT."

52:43.220 --> 52:45.882
MMM, WHAT'S THIS ?

52:45.990 --> 52:47.753
THAT ?

52:47.860 --> 52:49.725
THAT'S THE ROCK.

52:51.200 --> 52:54.499
I WOULD DEFINITELY
TAP THAT ASS.

52:59.240 --> 53:01.606
I'M STILL NOT
OUT AT WORK.

53:01.710 --> 53:03.530
YEAH, SO ?

53:05.580 --> 53:08.174
I THOUGHT YOU WERE KINDA
PUSHING ME TO COME OUT.

53:11.580 --> 53:13.514
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

53:13.620 --> 53:14.848
IT'S BORING.

53:16.090 --> 53:17.819
AND I'D RATHER
NOT FIGHT.

53:21.190 --> 53:22.828
OKAY.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.359
DID YOU HAVE FUN ?

53:32.470 --> 53:33.630
HUH, DID YOU
HAVE FUN ?

53:33.740 --> 53:34.661
SHE HAD A BLAST.

53:34.770 --> 53:38.706
I CAN REALLY SEE
LISA IN HER, NATE.

53:38.810 --> 53:40.505
YEAH, LISTEN, BARB,

53:41.510 --> 53:44.445
I NEED TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

53:44.550 --> 53:45.687
I, UH...

53:46.990 --> 53:49.481
I WENT TO A PSYCHIC.

53:51.260 --> 53:55.253
UH-HUH,
WAS THAT HELPFUL ?

53:58.330 --> 54:00.764
SHE SAID LISA'S
STILL ALIVE.

54:04.040 --> 54:06.235
JESUS CHRIST.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.268
I DON'T
BELIEVE THIS.

54:09.380 --> 54:11.007
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, NATE ?

54:11.110 --> 54:12.441
DO YOU NEED HELP ?

54:12.550 --> 54:14.177
BECAUSE IF YOU DO,
YOU SHOULD GET IT.

54:14.280 --> 54:16.748
AND NOT FROM
A FUCKING PSYCHIC.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.690
( soft music playing )

54:33.100 --> 54:34.920
I WANT
TO HAVE KIDS TOO.

54:38.300 --> 54:39.801
OR JUST ONE...

54:39.910 --> 54:43.471
OR SEVERAL.

54:43.580 --> 54:45.207
AND I WANT
TO HAVE THEM...

54:45.310 --> 54:47.278
IT...

54:47.380 --> 54:50.543
WITH YOU.

54:53.490 --> 54:59.759
I MEAN, I NEVER REALLY
SAW MYSELF AS, OR...

54:59.860 --> 55:02.727
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT
IT WAS POSSIBLE,

55:02.830 --> 55:05.765
BUT SOMEHOW
EVER SINCE WE'VE MET...

55:08.870 --> 55:11.691
EVERYTHING SEEMS--

55:18.940 --> 55:22.569
( music )

55:27.050 --> 55:30.349
