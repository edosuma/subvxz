00:14.279 --> 00:17.016
April 22nd, 3:00 AM.

00:18.451 --> 00:19.452
The ward doesn't have her.

00:20.185 --> 00:21.187
I do.

00:23.388 --> 00:25.759
By the time they've
figured out, we'll be gone.

00:32.731 --> 00:33.765
The
ward doesn't have her.

00:33.798 --> 00:34.801
I do.

00:37.136 --> 00:39.239
By the time they've figured
it out, we'll be gone.

01:01.726 --> 01:03.762
The patient has reached
non-rapid eye movement sleep

01:05.763 --> 01:11.736
and is expressing a period of
emotional realism triggered

01:11.769 --> 01:14.573
by an extreme psychologically
important event.

02:06.724 --> 02:12.198
Darcy, stay where you
are in your dream.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.233
What do you see?

02:14.466 --> 02:15.468
What do you hear?

02:17.669 --> 02:19.337
Nobody is going to hurt you.

02:19.371 --> 02:21.841
But you have to let me in.

02:21.873 --> 02:23.209
First
you're chosen.

02:23.241 --> 02:24.242
Then you're used.

02:24.276 --> 02:25.278
First you're chosen.

02:25.311 --> 02:25.944
Then you're used.

02:25.978 --> 02:27.180
First you're chosen.

02:27.212 --> 02:28.180
Then you're used.

02:28.213 --> 02:29.181
First you're chosen.

02:29.215 --> 02:30.216
Then you're used.

02:30.248 --> 02:32.685
What are you saying?

02:32.717 --> 02:34.286
First
you're chosen.

02:34.319 --> 02:35.453
What is it?

02:35.486 --> 02:36.621
First
you're chosen.

02:36.655 --> 02:37.689
Then you're used.

02:39.258 --> 02:40.225
What do you see?

02:46.331 --> 02:47.332
Darcy?

02:59.245 --> 03:00.346
Stand up.

03:01.413 --> 03:02.415
Just sit there.

03:07.986 --> 03:09.188
It's OK.

03:15.627 --> 03:16.762
That's going to be sore.

03:18.963 --> 03:19.966
I'll take care.

03:23.701 --> 03:25.371
Put your hands over here.

03:25.403 --> 03:28.274
Lean your head
against the mirror.

03:28.306 --> 03:30.575
You probably see that one hand
tied to the bed will be enough.

03:30.609 --> 03:31.844
It didn't work, did it?

03:43.455 --> 03:46.326
I can't help you if you
don't try to remember.

03:49.328 --> 03:50.763
I'm scared.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.299
Scared of what?

03:55.533 --> 03:56.935
Of what I might become.

03:58.537 --> 04:01.706
It's clear in
documented evidence

04:01.740 --> 04:03.643
that these children sleep
walk because they are trying

04:03.675 --> 04:05.543
to get back to their abuser.

04:05.576 --> 04:07.513
You want to confront her.

04:07.545 --> 04:09.581
You have to go where she is.

04:09.615 --> 04:11.484
She's dead.

04:11.516 --> 04:15.388
The breakthrough we
need lies in those walls,

04:15.420 --> 04:18.391
not these, not serenity.

04:18.423 --> 04:22.495
What she did to me in that
house... going back there.

04:24.495 --> 04:26.399
And you really
think it will work?

04:32.538 --> 04:33.439
It has to work.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.345
If I see you regressing,
I'll get you out of there.

04:41.413 --> 04:44.417
And I promise I'll
torch the place myself.

04:49.687 --> 04:51.324
Let's get some sleep.

05:38.137 --> 05:40.506
After a continuous night time
somnambulism therapy,

05:42.574 --> 05:46.778
the patient has shown no signs
of the ability or desire

05:46.812 --> 05:50.449
to express suppressed physical
and emotional memories...

05:52.151 --> 05:55.721
continual self-abuse and
injury occur nightly.

05:55.754 --> 05:57.556
Scheduled awakenings
have been applied

05:57.588 --> 05:59.391
and the results are nil.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.461
Three days ago, I was
notified by the county

06:02.494 --> 06:06.799
that the patient's family
homestead is abandoned and left

06:06.831 --> 06:10.870
to her by default as the
only living family member.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.872
In spite of the
patients unwillingness

06:12.904 --> 06:17.008
to accept recommended therapy,
the next course of action

06:17.041 --> 06:19.477
is complete submersion in the
environment where.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.991
<b>CUT HER OUT</b>

06:27.112 --> 06:30.112
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

07:17.970 --> 07:18.871
You'll be fine.

07:20.771 --> 07:21.873
I'm going to take a look.

10:13.778 --> 10:14.879
What?

10:16.347 --> 10:17.682
What is it?

10:21.219 --> 10:22.221
Darcy?

11:31.456 --> 11:32.425
Look, it's chips.

12:03.855 --> 12:04.856
Do you know me?

12:36.187 --> 12:37.322
You can pass me that bowl.

12:47.465 --> 12:48.533
It's OK.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.069
You can eat.

12:51.937 --> 12:52.937
That's OK.

12:58.876 --> 13:02.213
He can't... can't eat until
he's been given permission.

13:02.246 --> 13:04.415
If you ate before she said
it, you'd get the whip.

13:06.183 --> 13:11.557
Say that the she did...
put yourself in her skin.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.393
She's standing over him
placing food in his bowl.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.261
Before she leaves,
what does she say?

13:16.293 --> 13:18.129
Don't make me say it.

13:18.163 --> 13:19.932
I'm going to be sick.

13:19.965 --> 13:20.899
Do you know the words?

13:20.932 --> 13:22.334
Yes.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.368
Then say them.

13:26.538 --> 13:30.842
You... you are
hungry for beast.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.814
But in my loving mercy, I
have left you this feast.

13:58.202 --> 13:59.204
Come on in.

14:00.572 --> 14:01.841
You're not ghost.

14:06.945 --> 14:07.947
We're not going to hurt you.

14:11.048 --> 14:11.917
Can you tell me your name?

14:47.952 --> 14:48.953
Sam?

14:50.388 --> 14:51.257
It's nice to meet you, Sam.

14:52.557 --> 14:53.558
I'll leave the
door open for you.

15:00.197 --> 15:01.332
We've arrived.

15:01.365 --> 15:03.100
It's worse than I thought.

15:03.134 --> 15:07.538
We found a feral child
named Sam living here

15:07.572 --> 15:10.107
in deplorable conditions.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.978
He appears malnourished,
but otherwise healthy.

15:14.011 --> 15:16.714
His only communication has
been roaring and growling,

15:16.748 --> 15:21.286
but has cognitive abilities
that is expressed by hearing

15:21.318 --> 15:23.120
and following a command.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.442
His name is Sam.

15:46.577 --> 15:48.512
Is he your brother, Darcy?

15:48.546 --> 15:49.480
Are there others?

15:52.116 --> 15:54.019
How could I tell you about
things that I don't remember.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.691
I have no idea about
him or anything else

15:59.724 --> 16:01.126
we might find here.

16:02.494 --> 16:03.729
He's just sitting in that
room.

16:05.462 --> 16:06.397
What is that room?

16:07.698 --> 16:09.434
I'm not going back in there.

16:11.635 --> 16:13.171
I can't face this.

16:15.139 --> 16:16.140
You can't pretend that
room doesn't exist.

16:18.176 --> 16:21.580
Maybe that's the starting
point for your healing.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.683
Maybe that's the place
where your pain lives.

16:24.716 --> 16:28.387
But right now you need to
show that little boy that you

16:28.419 --> 16:31.522
understand the place he's in.

16:31.556 --> 16:32.824
I'll try to get
him to come out.

16:35.326 --> 16:39.264
But if I do, then you have to
promise me you'll board it up.

16:41.298 --> 16:42.134
Of course.

17:23.173 --> 17:24.343
I lived in here too.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.714
I know what happens
in this room.

17:31.648 --> 17:33.117
It's wrong that you're in
here.

17:34.486 --> 17:37.522
And it's wrong what
she did to you.

17:37.555 --> 17:40.158
You think you're an animal.

17:40.191 --> 17:41.393
But you're not.

17:44.729 --> 17:51.236
I need you to come out with
me and let me guide you

17:51.269 --> 17:57.275
to some place new...
a place where no one

17:57.307 --> 17:59.711
whips you or starves you.

18:01.445 --> 18:04.348
When you get ready, I'm
going to be right outside.

18:06.550 --> 18:07.785
And I'm going to be
waiting for you.

18:07.818 --> 18:08.820
OK?

19:22.393 --> 19:23.260
Dr. Andrews.

19:23.294 --> 19:24.461
You fucking idiot.

19:24.494 --> 19:25.863
Excuse me?

19:25.896 --> 19:27.464
Don't play dumb.

19:27.498 --> 19:28.432
Bring her back.

19:28.465 --> 19:30.568
And I mean right now.

19:30.602 --> 19:34.206
If you do, maybe
you keep your job.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.440
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:35.472 --> 19:36.441
I'm on leave.

19:36.473 --> 19:37.641
() Then
why are you on leave?

19:37.674 --> 19:38.542
You want to talk about that?

19:38.576 --> 19:39.777
It wasn't my fault.

19:39.810 --> 19:42.279
() You can't
save the world, Dr. Andrews.

19:42.313 --> 19:44.282
They are crazy.

19:44.315 --> 19:46.618
You're putting yourself and
this institution in danger

19:46.651 --> 19:48.420
just because your kid died.

19:48.452 --> 19:50.754
Tell me this... how
do we expect people

19:50.788 --> 19:52.656
to get better when
all we do is drug them

19:52.690 --> 19:54.659
and lock them in a cell?

19:54.692 --> 19:56.228
() Last week
you took a violent sociopath

19:56.260 --> 19:57.761
to the ward without
permission.

19:57.795 --> 19:59.998
And he nearly killed someone.

20:00.030 --> 20:02.634
The world is not your
personal asylum, Ryan.

20:02.666 --> 20:06.003
Now, I am asking you as your
colleague... bring her back.

20:06.037 --> 20:08.240
Like I said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:08.272 --> 20:09.273
I'm on leave.

21:05.462 --> 21:06.464
Don't smoke.

21:07.597 --> 21:08.733
Mother wouldn't like that.

21:11.536 --> 21:12.770
She's dead.

21:14.338 --> 21:15.874
You can do anything you like.

21:18.009 --> 21:20.545
Like get well... something else
your mother wouldn't like.

21:21.679 --> 21:24.883
Sam's not ready.

21:24.915 --> 21:26.817
He doesn't trust us.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.824
She was manipulative like
that... would give a command

21:32.856 --> 21:35.093
and then beat you
when you obey.

21:35.125 --> 21:36.295
Let him stay.

21:38.363 --> 21:39.564
The last thing we should do
is force anything on him.

21:40.932 --> 21:41.799
We sit back.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.403
And we let him figure
out how to respond to us.

21:45.435 --> 21:46.169
No.

21:47.672 --> 21:49.874
No, we have to get
him out of here.

21:49.906 --> 21:50.875
We have to tell
the authorities.

21:52.509 --> 21:56.780
The only way this works
is if you get well.

21:56.814 --> 21:58.950
Remember, we talked about
this.

21:58.982 --> 22:03.321
Otherwise, they take
you... they drug you up.

22:05.522 --> 22:08.425
They throw you back
in the water.

22:08.459 --> 22:12.764
I can't look at him.

22:12.797 --> 22:16.867
I've spent years trying to
kill that part of myself.

22:19.871 --> 22:22.507
And now it sits
right in front of me.

22:24.608 --> 22:28.812
Every breath reminding
me it will never die.

22:28.846 --> 22:33.518
You're a kid just like Sam.

22:33.550 --> 22:34.385
But he doesn't have
to fight alone.

22:34.419 --> 22:35.787
He has us.

22:38.021 --> 22:42.860
You save Sam, you save
yourself, essentially.

22:42.894 --> 22:46.463
But I need you
in there with me.

22:46.497 --> 22:49.534
I can't... I won't be able to
sleep without you.

22:54.538 --> 22:55.539
Of course.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.555
Go to sleep.

25:01.265 --> 25:08.240
Five hours
of non-compliance.

25:10.674 --> 25:14.546
The subject has emerged
from the pen.

25:14.578 --> 25:16.714
The source of his
security is unknown.

25:25.323 --> 25:26.525
Don't wake him.

25:32.762 --> 25:33.764
This is going to work.

25:35.266 --> 25:37.669
Today we start.

25:37.701 --> 25:42.173
We start in the house...
get some more rest.

27:43.493 --> 27:44.695
You awake?

27:47.097 --> 27:47.865
Kind of.

27:50.334 --> 27:55.339
Two things I'm
thankful for... Sam.

27:55.372 --> 27:57.442
What's the second?

27:57.474 --> 27:58.942
You trusting me
not to sleepwalk.

28:01.511 --> 28:04.749
Like I said before,
I'm glad you're just

28:04.781 --> 28:06.750
trying to get back home.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.087
You're here now.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.122
You don't need them.

28:43.788 --> 28:47.791
Once upon a time,
there was a master

28:47.825 --> 28:51.796
who had a horse who had been a
faithful and loyal servant.

28:53.230 --> 28:56.534
But soon the beast
turned on his master

28:56.567 --> 29:00.739
and he became
disobedient and weak.

29:33.237 --> 29:35.439
He's still not talking.

29:35.471 --> 29:37.508
But he brought me some
paper and his black crayon

29:37.540 --> 29:39.943
and just sat down
and started drawing.

29:39.977 --> 29:41.412
That's good.

29:41.444 --> 29:42.813
How are you?

29:44.214 --> 29:45.282
I am not looking back.

29:46.616 --> 29:48.819
It's about today.
Am good.

29:52.388 --> 29:53.791
It's because of you
he's getting better.

30:12.509 --> 30:13.577
Is black your
favorite color too?

30:16.046 --> 30:17.849
How am I going to color
with you if there is just

30:17.882 --> 30:18.817
one black crayon?

30:25.088 --> 30:25.956
Problem solved.

30:29.894 --> 30:30.961
Yeah?

30:41.070 --> 30:45.843
We're getting my start from the
tree house of all tree houses.

31:15.172 --> 31:17.107
My first observation

31:17.141 --> 31:19.944
of Sam was, he has the
same brown eyes as Rodney.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.015
I can't believe it's
been four years.

31:26.083 --> 31:30.955
Maybe it's just my second
chance to... I don't know.

31:48.972 --> 31:51.408
Big plans for the
back yard?

31:51.442 --> 31:53.478
Dog, he thinks he's the dog.

31:55.278 --> 31:58.982
Maybe he just wants
to name the dog Sam.

31:59.016 --> 32:01.384
Before I got back here, did
you talk to him about mother?

32:01.417 --> 32:04.187
Did you tell him that she
treated you like an animal too?

32:04.221 --> 32:05.222
Why would I scare
him like that?

32:11.127 --> 32:12.062
Just fucking say it.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.600
I'm just some project to you.

32:19.169 --> 32:23.274
I'm here because I love you.

32:25.541 --> 32:31.749
I am here for you in this
house to find your pain.

32:31.781 --> 32:33.951
There is no you
and me... just you.

32:35.586 --> 32:36.721
Because of
some crazy title?

32:36.753 --> 32:40.256
Stop.
Stop.

32:40.289 --> 32:41.625
What if I got better?

32:44.627 --> 32:46.096
That's why we're here.

32:47.297 --> 32:48.333
Would you love me then?

32:51.167 --> 32:52.302
It would definitely
be easier, yes.

32:54.270 --> 32:56.374
Tomorrow night we
start hypnosis.

32:58.709 --> 33:02.145
This picture... this
is our starting point.

33:27.070 --> 33:29.039
You can be able to sleep
alone here tonight.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.074
You know why?

33:31.474 --> 33:32.442
I brought you one of my
shirts.

33:33.743 --> 33:34.711
Would you like to wear it?

33:48.826 --> 33:50.094
Our son used to wear
my shirts to sleep in.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.134
He said it made him feel
safe.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.069
He'd be about your age now.

34:02.605 --> 34:03.607
Am glad you found yourself.

34:06.477 --> 34:07.644
You know what?

34:10.179 --> 34:11.248
We're going to get your
lights in here fixed soon.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.282
OK?

34:14.284 --> 34:15.286
Get some sleep.

34:52.588 --> 34:56.360
Sam, have you ever
used a spoon before?

34:58.327 --> 34:59.195
Let's try it.

34:59.228 --> 35:00.230
Let me see your hand.

35:02.900 --> 35:03.867
Your going to grab it just
like that... real tight.

35:08.338 --> 35:10.708
All right, we'll go in...
got to get to the bottom.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.443
That's where the milk is...
see?

35:12.476 --> 35:13.544
A little bite... a little
bite... not too big.

35:13.577 --> 35:15.880
There you go.
See the milk?

35:15.913 --> 35:18.315
We then go in...
lift up... perfect.

35:19.449 --> 35:21.851
That's right.

35:21.885 --> 35:23.387
All the way to the
bottom... get that milk.

35:25.222 --> 35:26.224
That's a big bite.

35:29.259 --> 35:30.226
See?

35:30.260 --> 35:31.662
I told you it was a big bite.

35:31.695 --> 35:33.931
I'd do a little less than
that.

35:33.963 --> 35:37.300
And, Sam, make sure you drink
the milk when you finish.

35:37.333 --> 35:38.335
It's the best part.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.305
More.

35:46.309 --> 35:48.211
I've got some work to do.

35:48.244 --> 35:49.246
Good job, Sam.

37:08.492 --> 37:09.360
What's happening?

37:14.331 --> 37:15.666
You were touching things.

37:15.699 --> 37:17.934
Mhm.

37:17.967 --> 37:19.502
You felt the sensation
of that on your lips.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.775
It was metal mixed with
blood.

37:24.807 --> 37:25.775
What was in your
mouth last night?

37:32.382 --> 37:37.320
And you made her put
that bit in your mouth.

37:37.353 --> 37:42.492
She would just stick
it in and hold my nose

37:44.427 --> 37:45.895
and caress my hands.

37:48.565 --> 37:52.469
Talk to mother now...
not the little girl.

37:52.501 --> 37:53.971
Talk to mom.

37:55.472 --> 37:57.375
I didn't mean to
bite you, mother.

37:58.809 --> 38:03.314
But you just... you
kept pushing it in.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.916
Tell her how much you hate
her.

38:05.949 --> 38:07.684
Don't you talk to me that
way.

38:10.353 --> 38:13.456
Fiends...
they are coming.

38:13.489 --> 38:15.391
Let them out.

38:15.425 --> 38:17.394
My baby.

38:17.427 --> 38:19.596
My baby.

38:19.628 --> 38:23.500
You can't hurt my
baby that way.

38:23.532 --> 38:24.835
And I trained you so well.

38:27.503 --> 38:30.074
The weak one get it the
worst.

38:30.106 --> 38:33.443
But it's for their own good.

38:33.476 --> 38:35.346
They survive.

38:35.378 --> 38:38.581
They become the master.

38:38.614 --> 38:39.982
What does that mean?

38:40.016 --> 38:43.052
Or is it you?

38:58.434 --> 39:00.137
What did you do to me?

39:00.170 --> 39:01.438
It's all right.

39:01.471 --> 39:02.440
You came so far just now.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.513
What's coming out is exactly
what I knew we could find here.

39:12.481 --> 39:16.420
Don't tell me... don't
tell me... not one

39:16.452 --> 39:17.954
word of what I just said.

39:17.987 --> 39:18.855
It's OK.

39:19.789 --> 39:20.590
Here.

39:21.824 --> 39:23.827
After the initial
hypnosis session.

39:25.528 --> 39:28.398
There's great evidence MPD.

39:28.431 --> 39:31.668
The patient speaks in two
distinct personalities.

41:13.737 --> 41:14.872
I don't have time to play
hangman right now, partner.

41:16.739 --> 41:18.508
I got to go to town
and get supplies.

41:18.541 --> 41:20.810
We have a lot of work
to do around here.

41:20.844 --> 41:22.546
I need you to be
man of the house.

41:25.181 --> 41:26.217
You guys will be OK without
me.

41:27.684 --> 41:28.686
Keep around Darcy.

41:34.757 --> 41:37.527
I made this for you
in case you got hungry.

41:37.561 --> 41:38.696
Thank you.

41:40.563 --> 41:43.533
Don't try to do too
much around here, OK?

41:43.567 --> 41:45.635
Maybe you and Sam can work
on the tree house.

41:45.668 --> 41:46.769
That sound good?

41:47.871 --> 41:48.873
OK.

42:41.324 --> 42:42.925
Yeah, I know you're here.

43:49.224 --> 43:53.797
Sam, you know the
rules... her rules.

44:00.036 --> 44:05.842
Remember the story about the
disobedient horse wandering

44:05.875 --> 44:10.648
in the woods sad because
his monster didn't want him?

44:12.748 --> 44:14.283
He began to enjoy his
freedom.

44:15.818 --> 44:18.822
He felt wild and alive.

44:18.855 --> 44:22.693
But soon he began to
feel terribly lonely.

44:22.726 --> 44:24.394
And he knew that he had no
one to take care of him.

44:26.762 --> 44:31.768
And what he didn't know
was that deep in the woods

44:31.800 --> 44:33.737
a man was drawing a dark
plan.

44:35.472 --> 44:38.307
He had set a trap for
the little horse...

44:38.340 --> 44:40.911
made of flowers
and sweet grass.

44:44.347 --> 44:45.315
Hey, Sam.

44:48.083 --> 44:49.318
What you doing?

44:50.487 --> 44:51.689
Can I see it?

44:58.795 --> 44:59.829
You didn't go in the
woods today did you, Sam?

44:59.862 --> 45:00.730
No.

45:02.931 --> 45:03.933
And you didn't
board up with Ken.

45:12.074 --> 45:13.342
Got something for you.

45:15.911 --> 45:16.913
Open.

45:20.449 --> 45:21.451
Take one out.

45:23.418 --> 45:24.754
See?

45:24.788 --> 45:26.824
Now we have a whole
crayon each.

45:28.391 --> 45:29.393
You like that?

45:33.061 --> 45:35.831
Do you know anything
about electrical wiring?

45:35.864 --> 45:37.767
Because I got to take
care of some of the parts.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.869
Then we can get that light
in the room fixed, OK?

45:54.449 --> 45:58.387
Hey, Sam, I need you
to do me a favor.

45:58.420 --> 46:00.356
Go tell Darcy to
kill the breaker.

46:00.389 --> 46:02.158
Can you do that for me?

46:02.192 --> 46:03.860
Kill the breaker.

46:11.400 --> 46:18.541
R- E-A-K-E-R... perfect.

46:35.224 --> 46:36.826
Are we clear?

46:50.273 --> 46:51.275
Dammit!

46:57.880 --> 46:59.548
Why didn't you
kill the breaker?

46:59.581 --> 47:00.983
What are you talking about?

47:01.016 --> 47:02.384
I just got electrocuted.

47:02.418 --> 47:03.954
Sam, did you tell her
to kill the breaker?

47:03.987 --> 47:05.255
He didn't tell
me anything, Ryan.

47:05.288 --> 47:06.489
He doesn't talk.

47:06.521 --> 47:08.023
I saw him write it down,
Darcy.

47:08.056 --> 47:09.192
Let us see your hands.

47:09.224 --> 47:10.960
There's no need
to see my hands.

47:10.994 --> 47:12.562
Next time, you do
what I tell you, OK?

47:12.594 --> 47:13.863
Let go of him.

47:15.565 --> 47:16.567
Why would you do that?

48:35.711 --> 48:37.581
And you see why you
have to listen to mom.

48:40.215 --> 48:44.153
Disobedience gets you hurt.

48:44.186 --> 48:47.223
And the only way to stay
safe is to stay close to me.

48:50.326 --> 48:53.228
Don't turn away from me, Sam.

48:53.262 --> 48:56.499
Let me protect you from her.

48:56.532 --> 49:00.704
And she'll haunt your
dreams like she does mine.

49:07.175 --> 49:13.717
() I found
a fresh wound on Sam's back

49:17.253 --> 49:20.023
in the shape of a dark
circle.

49:20.056 --> 49:23.693
Prior to that, I found
a ringing music box.

49:27.030 --> 49:28.065
I don't want to see
that side of you again.

49:29.431 --> 49:30.299
It won't happen again.

49:32.201 --> 49:35.137
And what you did today is
not going to help Sam heal.

49:37.273 --> 49:39.041
I'll apologize to
him when I see him.

49:41.043 --> 49:42.711
If you don't mind, I
have some work to do.

49:42.744 --> 49:46.048
And I would like some space.

49:46.081 --> 49:47.549
You're not telling him to
kill the breaker

49:47.583 --> 49:49.552
and running into the woods.

49:49.585 --> 49:51.755
That's him testing me.

49:51.788 --> 49:52.688
I can't let him think
he's in control.

49:58.126 --> 50:01.364
You want to break
us just like she did...

50:01.396 --> 50:04.701
make us feel beneath you.

50:06.735 --> 50:08.704
Sam and I are your equal, right?

50:10.239 --> 50:13.275
I will not let you control us.

50:13.309 --> 50:14.611
Look, I'm trying to keep you
both from harming yourselves.

50:16.079 --> 50:16.747
Children need boundaries.

50:29.291 --> 50:30.259
Fuck off.

50:48.277 --> 50:49.646
Sam!

50:49.679 --> 50:52.215
Sam!

50:52.248 --> 50:53.083
Where are you?

50:53.115 --> 50:54.617
Sam.

50:54.650 --> 50:56.286
Where are you?

50:56.318 --> 50:58.121
Ryan.

50:58.153 --> 50:59.255
Ryan, wake up.

50:59.288 --> 51:00.556
Wake up. I can't find him.

51:03.291 --> 51:05.561
Sam, he wasn't in his room.

51:05.594 --> 51:06.663
I can't find him.

51:06.695 --> 51:08.130
He's not in his room.

51:08.164 --> 51:09.232
Maybe he went outside.

51:09.264 --> 51:10.132
OK.

51:10.166 --> 51:11.501
OK, I'll go look.

51:11.534 --> 51:12.469
I'll look.

51:43.398 --> 51:45.167
Sam?

51:45.201 --> 51:46.702
How did you get in here?

51:46.735 --> 51:47.804
How did you get in here, bub?

51:52.375 --> 51:56.179
Sam, I'm sorry I yelled at
you.

51:56.211 --> 51:58.849
It wasn't your fault. You don't
need to be in this room.

52:00.782 --> 52:02.284
Why don't you come with me?

52:02.318 --> 52:03.286
Let's get you cleaned
up, all right?

52:05.454 --> 52:06.456
All right.

52:08.324 --> 52:09.326
Right.

52:25.775 --> 52:28.311
I think it's the perfect day
to start on Sam's hideaway.

52:30.512 --> 52:31.914
There's no place for Sam
to hide... not from her.

52:42.391 --> 52:44.927
There's no one here
to hide from, Sam.

52:44.960 --> 52:46.395
So you don't have
to go on that road.

52:48.364 --> 52:49.365
You'll have your own place.

52:50.632 --> 52:51.634
Isn't that what you want?

52:53.335 --> 52:55.204
She can't make me come there.

52:55.237 --> 52:57.406
You said so, right?

52:57.440 --> 53:00.677
Sam, who did this to you?

53:02.878 --> 53:03.880
Was it Darcy?

53:08.617 --> 53:09.552
Was it mother?

53:16.592 --> 53:19.262
There is no mother.

53:43.385 --> 53:44.454
Running.

53:46.389 --> 53:49.526
I was running in the
woods looking for Sam.

53:51.460 --> 53:54.297
And she was chasing me.

53:54.329 --> 53:58.768
My mother... she didn't... she
didn't want me to give to you.

54:02.438 --> 54:04.440
I found him in a pen.

54:04.472 --> 54:05.375
You did?

54:06.474 --> 54:07.576
Thank god.

54:16.385 --> 54:17.387
How did you get
in there, Darcy?

54:19.655 --> 54:20.690
What do you mean?

54:21.891 --> 54:23.425
I mean, the boards
were taken down.

54:23.458 --> 54:24.326
And they were put back up.

54:25.661 --> 54:26.663
He was locked in there.

54:28.364 --> 54:29.565
Someone put him in there.

54:29.597 --> 54:30.900
It wasn't me.

54:32.467 --> 54:33.402
It was her.

54:34.603 --> 54:36.773
And she's not...
she's not dead, Ryan.

54:41.409 --> 54:42.378
He just talked to me.

54:43.679 --> 54:44.947
What did he tell you?

54:46.815 --> 54:47.817
Tell me what?

54:49.518 --> 54:50.952
Anything.

54:50.985 --> 54:52.788
Yes, he did.

54:52.822 --> 54:53.823
What did he say?

54:57.492 --> 54:59.295
He said, there is no mother.

55:22.050 --> 55:23.052
Sam.

55:24.954 --> 55:27.490
Ryan told me you spoke to
him.

55:31.427 --> 55:33.663
Did you say something to
Ryan.

55:42.704 --> 55:44.773
He doesn't live in our skin.

55:47.443 --> 55:50.714
You see, he wants
to fix our heart

55:53.047 --> 55:56.618
when he doesn't understand
our heart is not broken.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.956
It never worked
right from the start.

56:03.425 --> 56:05.628
But that's our secret, OK.

56:05.661 --> 56:07.764
All we have to do is act.

56:09.864 --> 56:13.502
Act like we're better and
then we can leave this place.

57:28.844 --> 57:30.213
I bet you worked up
quite an appetite?

57:30.246 --> 57:31.213
Yes.

57:31.246 --> 57:32.449
Yes, I did.

57:36.784 --> 57:39.788
Sam, is there anything
I can say or do

57:39.822 --> 57:40.824
to help you get the words
out?

57:48.264 --> 57:49.566
It's lunchtime, guys.

57:54.670 --> 57:55.637
He's getting better.

58:18.960 --> 58:19.962
Now I am in the dark.

58:21.230 --> 58:22.231
Now I am in the room.

58:23.331 --> 58:24.600
What room?

58:26.101 --> 58:27.103
The pen?

58:28.070 --> 58:29.072
Yes.

58:32.574 --> 58:33.708
Are you...

58:36.612 --> 58:40.182
There's someone.

58:40.215 --> 58:41.717
Ask them who they are.

58:41.750 --> 58:42.751
Who are you?

58:47.722 --> 58:48.690
It's Darcy.

58:51.994 --> 58:52.996
Hi, Darcy.

58:55.797 --> 58:56.798
Who was I just talking to?

58:58.166 --> 58:59.235
I don't know.

59:03.304 --> 59:04.839
Who else is in there with
you?

59:04.873 --> 59:06.309
Don't do that.

59:07.275 --> 59:09.611
Don't do that.

59:09.644 --> 59:11.980
She's going to hear you.

59:12.014 --> 59:13.016
Stop it.

59:18.086 --> 59:19.088
Darcy.

59:24.126 --> 59:27.230
You never listen to mother!

59:28.630 --> 59:30.865
That's why we're here.

59:30.898 --> 59:32.101
I love you!

59:32.134 --> 59:33.135
I love you!

59:46.014 --> 59:48.083
God.

59:48.117 --> 59:50.086
What happened?

59:50.119 --> 59:51.721
What did I do?

59:52.920 --> 59:53.922
It's OK.

59:55.090 --> 59:56.892
You didn't do anything.

59:56.925 --> 59:58.193
It was my fault.

59:59.695 --> 01:00:00.696
Are you sure?

01:00:00.728 --> 01:00:02.063
Yeah, positive.

01:00:02.097 --> 01:00:04.133
You did great.

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:05.167
We just had a breakthrough.

01:00:05.199 --> 01:00:06.402
Really?

01:00:06.434 --> 01:00:07.670
Yeah. Really.

01:00:08.737 --> 01:00:09.606
Yeah. I'm proud of you.

01:00:12.407 --> 01:00:14.676
Why don't you get
rid of the meds.

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.713
No pills?

01:00:18.746 --> 01:00:20.048
No.

01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:21.683
No, you're good.

01:00:21.717 --> 01:00:23.019
Let me finish up some work,
OK?

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.053
OK.

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.367
What is it, Sam?

01:01:20.775 --> 01:01:21.810
Sam?

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:22.811
What happened?

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.347
What did you dream?

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.382
Did you do anything?
Are you hurt?

01:01:26.414 --> 01:01:27.382
Sam.

01:01:27.416 --> 01:01:29.018
What's wrong?

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.385
I don't know.

01:01:30.418 --> 01:01:31.687
It's blood.

01:01:33.822 --> 01:01:35.291
Why is his towel bloody?

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.360
Sam, go to the bathroom.

01:01:56.244 --> 01:01:58.780
Why did you use that towel?

01:01:58.813 --> 01:01:59.781
Didn't you see the blood on
it?

01:03:35.443 --> 01:03:36.978
Spavine.

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.821
Don't you ever call me that?

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:47.990
That's your name, isn't it?

01:03:51.425 --> 01:03:53.461
You're supposed to
be looking after me.

01:03:55.063 --> 01:03:56.932
You don't know
anything about her.

01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:00.403
Then tell me about her.

01:04:02.103 --> 01:04:05.206
There was another just like
me.

01:04:05.239 --> 01:04:06.575
But no more.

01:04:08.476 --> 01:04:09.911
Spavine died in that pen.

01:04:12.614 --> 01:04:15.851
Don't you ever let that
name come from your lips.

01:04:17.552 --> 01:04:21.390
I can't help you if you
keep secrets from me.

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:26.262
This is my
darkness... not yours.

01:04:27.929 --> 01:04:32.333
This belongs to Sam and I.
We carry that name.

01:04:32.367 --> 01:04:33.369
No.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:35.571
Sam doesn't have your wounds.

01:04:37.539 --> 01:04:39.041
You want him to be like you.

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:41.410
He's not.

01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:43.646
You don't know what he feels.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:46.048
I do.

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:53.989
Sam and I... we walked
through that hell.

01:04:54.021 --> 01:04:57.960
And you... you just write
about it in your little book.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:04.666
Spavine, she was
my sister, Ryan.

01:05:09.271 --> 01:05:10.205
Sam.

01:05:10.237 --> 01:05:11.239
Sam.

01:05:17.144 --> 01:05:19.681
Why is he throwing up worms?

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:21.317
It's common in
the country, Ryan.

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:23.052
Kids get worms.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.286
You go to the pharmacy.

01:05:24.318 --> 01:05:26.154
They'll know what he needs.

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.256
No. I need to take him to a clinic
so they can take a look at him.

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:28.357
No, you go.

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:29.991
We'll be fine.

01:05:30.025 --> 01:05:31.027
Just go.

01:05:49.110 --> 01:05:54.951
Baby, what did mom tell you
about becoming an animal.

01:05:58.186 --> 01:06:00.323
Animals have worms,
Sam... not little boys.

01:06:03.257 --> 01:06:05.526
You are not one of them.

01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:07.228
And I am not either.

01:06:08.496 --> 01:06:10.365
Ryan put that thought in you.

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:13.135
And you have to
fight against it.

01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:22.577
Did you know that animals
are incapable of love?

01:06:24.713 --> 01:06:28.751
It's false when they
show you affection.

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:32.121
When I tell you I love you,
it's because I'm not an animal.

01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:36.257
I am your mother.

01:07:31.545 --> 01:07:32.547
Hey Sam.

01:07:40.355 --> 01:07:42.557
No, no games.

01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:44.059
I need to ask you some
things.

01:07:57.172 --> 01:07:58.307
What does that mean to you?

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.420
She had other children.

01:09:35.935 --> 01:09:41.376
Sam has shown me the remains
that was other children.

01:09:46.648 --> 01:09:48.250
The causes of death unknown.

01:09:55.489 --> 01:09:59.360
My immediate concern is Darcy
has a neurotic disorder that's

01:09:59.394 --> 01:10:05.900
causing her to succumb to
the personality of mother.

01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:17.479
She is clearly unaware
that this alter ego exists.

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:24.286
The mother exists.

01:10:27.454 --> 01:10:33.628
And is slowly becoming... it's
becoming a dominant personality.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.935
When mother...

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:16.698
Will you leave us alone?

01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:17.899
Do you hear me, mother?

01:12:25.038 --> 01:12:26.474
We're not your beasts.

01:12:30.578 --> 01:12:37.486
Our love is stronger than
your leather ties and whips.

01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:51.432
No.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:10.071
There is no reason for such
an anatomic abnormality.

01:15:10.104 --> 01:15:14.208
The child is severely
undersized for the pictures.

01:15:14.242 --> 01:15:16.610
It appears she has
two sets of teeth...

01:15:16.644 --> 01:15:18.847
the straining harness
used on her body

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:22.083
to mobilize her... big, white
callous... heavy black bruising

01:15:22.115 --> 01:15:24.118
on the buttocks.

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.954
There are no pictures of the
child crying in all the time

01:15:26.988 --> 01:15:28.957
that she's seen.

01:15:28.989 --> 01:15:33.594
It's producing pleasures
when submersed in water.

01:15:33.627 --> 01:15:35.630
It seems cheap.

01:15:35.662 --> 01:15:38.199
Like she feels sensations
associated with water.

01:15:46.173 --> 01:15:49.310
That's it. Water.

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:55.083
Where did this go wrong?

01:16:01.689 --> 01:16:02.657
Look, you were right.

01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:03.692
This is out of my control.

01:16:07.795 --> 01:16:09.297
I'm going to sedate her
and bring her back.

01:16:10.364 --> 01:16:11.632
() Really?

01:16:11.666 --> 01:16:13.635
Glad you see you
came to your senses

01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:15.670
but the damage
has already been done.

01:16:15.703 --> 01:16:17.606
I used to be just like you.

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.140
I thought I could
cure them all.

01:16:19.172 --> 01:16:20.841
Will you just shut the fuck
up?

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:22.777
All right, listen,
I need a favor.

01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:23.778
() No.

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:24.778
I don't know where she is.

01:16:24.811 --> 01:16:25.779
And she has my gun.

01:16:25.813 --> 01:16:26.815
() Good.

01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:31.653
() 911.

01:16:31.685 --> 01:16:32.753
What's your emergency?

01:16:32.787 --> 01:16:36.091
Hi, this is Doctor
Ryan Andrews.

01:16:36.123 --> 01:16:39.693
And I've got a patient of mine
here at... give just one second.

01:16:39.726 --> 01:16:40.662
Who are you talking to?

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.036
() Sir?
Sir?

01:16:48.069 --> 01:16:51.640
Just checking my voice-mail.

01:16:51.672 --> 01:16:53.875
() Sir,
what is your location?

01:16:53.908 --> 01:16:55.276
Sir?

01:16:55.309 --> 01:16:57.378
Why do you
have a knife, Darcy?

01:16:57.412 --> 01:17:01.115
I had to cut her out.

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:04.819
I need to take Sam to town.
It's the worms.

01:17:04.851 --> 01:17:06.654
I think it's serious.

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:07.855
He belongs to me.

01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:11.893
He's your son, isn't
he?

01:17:11.926 --> 01:17:12.794
Yes.

01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:15.697
Who am I talking to right
now?

01:17:16.963 --> 01:17:18.233
Spavine.

01:17:19.766 --> 01:17:20.735
That's what I thought.

01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:23.739
There is no mother, is there?

01:17:25.006 --> 01:17:26.274
Of course there is.

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.878
Sam, come to mother.

01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:33.381
Stay right there, Sam.

01:17:33.413 --> 01:17:35.216
Sam, you don't
have to go with her.

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:38.719
You have been a bad boy.

01:17:40.387 --> 01:17:43.257
It's time for you
to go into the pen.

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:45.293
And don't worry.

01:17:45.326 --> 01:17:47.261
You have been a bad boy too.

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.764
And you are next.

01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:24.099
Where are you?

01:18:36.911 --> 01:18:37.913
I know you're here.

01:18:40.381 --> 01:18:44.285
I can smell you...
taste you in the air.

01:19:59.993 --> 01:20:01.796
I want you to put
the gun down, OK?

01:20:05.198 --> 01:20:06.867
It's OK.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.269
Just put the gun
down, that's enough.

01:20:13.073 --> 01:20:15.442
You're safe with me, OK?

01:20:15.475 --> 01:20:17.945
OK, I will protect you.

01:20:24.318 --> 01:20:25.854
You will?

01:20:25.886 --> 01:20:26.887
Yes.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.323
Now, please put the gun down.

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:38.166
Sam, did Darcy do these
horrible things to you?

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.036
Is someone else here?

01:20:42.069 --> 01:20:44.405
Is mother here?

01:20:44.438 --> 01:20:46.942
Mother... Spavine.

01:20:48.242 --> 01:20:49.244
OK, come on.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.216
OK, let's go.

01:21:04.992 --> 01:21:06.494
I want you to wait
right here buddy.

01:21:11.198 --> 01:21:13.034
I need you to wait right
here, OK... be right back.

01:22:33.113 --> 01:22:34.114
Sam!

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:15.757
Let's tell a new story.

01:23:19.359 --> 01:23:24.197
This one is about a baby
horse who was warned

01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:26.033
not to go into the woods.

01:23:27.801 --> 01:23:31.038
His mother warned him to
the beware of the wolf who

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:34.775
lived there and wanted
nothing more than to make

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.543
a meal of her little fawn.

01:23:38.679 --> 01:23:42.250
But her little horse was too
curious for his own good.

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:43.351
He disobeyed.

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:52.720
Sam!

01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:10.270
Sam?

01:25:10.304 --> 01:25:11.139
Sam, come here.

01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:11.905
Come here.

01:25:11.939 --> 01:25:14.142
Sam.
Let's go.
