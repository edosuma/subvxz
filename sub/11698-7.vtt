WEBVTT

00:01.933 --> 00:04.030
Just when it looked like all hope was lost,

00:04.078 --> 00:05.665
the handsome prince

00:07.138 --> 00:09.708
scaled the castle walls
and climbed the tower

00:09.708 --> 00:11.274
to slay the evil dragon.

00:11.275 --> 00:13.277
Shing! (Grunting)

00:15.313 --> 00:17.162
(Grunts)

00:18.316 --> 00:19.696
Would you die already?

00:20.783 --> 00:23.420
I've got scales made of forged steel.

00:23.421 --> 00:24.588
Okay?

00:24.589 --> 00:26.031
Plus I can breathe fire.

00:27.133 --> 00:28.592
Fine.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.659
(Groans)

00:29.660 --> 00:31.728
(Giggles)

00:32.259 --> 00:35.232
So with the kingdom now
safe from annoying dragons,

00:35.720 --> 00:37.828
Princess Emma could finally go off to sleep

00:37.834 --> 00:39.411
surrounded by her BFFs...

00:39.531 --> 00:40.806
Douglas the wonder dog...

00:40.818 --> 00:41.572
(Barks)

00:43.074 --> 00:44.885
Monica, the squish-faced hippo...

00:46.761 --> 00:48.712
and last but not least,

00:48.713 --> 00:49.909
Lamby.

00:52.383 --> 00:53.583
Where's Lamby?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.252
I don't know.

00:55.253 --> 00:57.655
Guys, we need Lamby.

00:57.655 --> 00:59.422
She's never gone to sleep without him.

00:59.423 --> 01:00.938
- (Crying)
- Oh no.

01:00.983 --> 01:03.335
Lip quivering, eyes filling, nose flaring.

01:03.329 --> 01:04.661
Guys, she's gonna lose it.

01:04.662 --> 01:06.370
She definitely had him at the park

01:06.364 --> 01:07.790
because I stopped a chihuahua

01:07.802 --> 01:09.423
from making it his girlfriend.

01:10.668 --> 01:13.083
And I know she had it on the way to the gym

01:13.083 --> 01:14.419
because I dropped it in a puddle.

01:14.453 --> 01:16.355
I mean, she dropped it in a puddle.

01:17.041 --> 01:19.175
What about after the gym?

01:19.501 --> 01:21.547
- All: Gym bag!
- Go! Ooh!

01:23.548 --> 01:24.507
Danny!

01:24.551 --> 01:26.897
I've got it! Tucker!

01:27.685 --> 01:28.768
(Grunts)

01:28.837 --> 01:29.838
Ben!

01:30.382 --> 01:31.488
Okay.

01:32.122 --> 01:34.775
And everyone in the kingdom
lived happily ever after

01:34.793 --> 01:37.727
thanks to a stuffed lamb that
kind of smells like puddle.

01:51.687 --> 01:52.900
Hey, I got here as soon as I could.

01:52.925 --> 01:54.244
Is there something wrong with Emma?

01:54.715 --> 01:57.080
Emma's not the problem.

01:57.287 --> 01:58.618
Hey, Benji.

01:58.738 --> 02:01.518
You know my favorite part
about having a roommate?

02:01.519 --> 02:03.762
It instantly doubles your wardrobe.

02:03.774 --> 02:04.857
(Chuckles)

02:04.907 --> 02:06.984
I mean, how cute is this, huh?

02:07.022 --> 02:08.217
(Tearing)

02:12.779 --> 02:15.468
You promised me she would
only be here for two days.

02:15.474 --> 02:17.389
How long does it take to fumigate a house?

02:17.408 --> 02:20.211
Well, if I told you the
truth, you would have said no.

02:21.737 --> 02:23.756
You have to get her out of here.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.517
I'm hosting book club.

02:27.988 --> 02:30.644
So sounds like my mom's
the least of your problems.

02:31.773 --> 02:34.231
Ben, all the cool girls
at work are in the club.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.402
It took me six weeks to
convince them to let me join.

02:36.415 --> 02:38.736
That's six weeks you're
never gonna get back.

02:40.062 --> 02:41.194
Mock all you want,

02:41.213 --> 02:42.341
but if you're in with them,

02:42.342 --> 02:43.624
you're in with everyone,

02:43.634 --> 02:45.117
so take your mom home with you, please?

02:45.349 --> 02:46.746
Hey, Riley, sorry.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.614
Had a little fashion accident.

02:48.734 --> 02:50.624
I guess you can consider these broken in.

02:51.825 --> 02:53.921
Mom, Riley's having her
book club here tonight,

02:53.946 --> 02:55.254
- so we should...
- Really?

02:55.255 --> 02:57.982
A book club? I love a good book club.

02:58.194 --> 03:00.265
What time, and what do
I have to pretend I read?

03:01.728 --> 03:03.338
Now that's how you get into a book club.

03:03.344 --> 03:04.563
Well done, mom.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.506
Oh, but we used to have
the best club back home.

03:08.706 --> 03:11.509
You know, that is until old miss fun sucker

03:11.491 --> 03:14.068
joined it and sucked all the fun out of it.

03:14.575 --> 03:16.159
By the way, tell your mom I said hi

03:16.177 --> 03:17.360
next time you talk to her.

03:18.845 --> 03:20.232
(Knocking on door)

03:20.457 --> 03:22.681
Oh look. I'm opening the door.

03:22.682 --> 03:24.316
What a fabulous opportunity

03:24.317 --> 03:26.312
for you to grab a loved one
and shove her through it.

03:28.221 --> 03:29.084
Mom?

03:29.456 --> 03:30.685
What are you doing here?

03:30.735 --> 03:32.781
When you emailed and said
you were hosting a book club,

03:32.806 --> 03:33.669
I told your father

03:33.694 --> 03:35.965
"not without my mushroom caps you're not."

03:36.563 --> 03:38.011
Mom, I was just letting you know

03:38.018 --> 03:39.231
why I couldn't come home for dinner.

03:39.351 --> 03:41.853
So, Mrs. Perrin, long time.

03:41.973 --> 03:43.667
Don't think you've met Emma.

03:43.673 --> 03:46.614
Oh my God. Is she not the cutest?

03:46.808 --> 03:49.204
You know, when I heard you
had knocked up some girl

03:49.223 --> 03:50.812
and were raising a baby on your own,

03:50.818 --> 03:53.207
I thought "who didn't see that coming?"

03:55.972 --> 03:57.516
And I think we're going.

03:58.175 --> 03:59.718
Not another step.

03:59.719 --> 04:01.387
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

04:01.388 --> 04:03.530
I'm so glad that you're
finally joining things.

04:03.562 --> 04:04.782
You get that from me.

04:04.902 --> 04:07.335
Mom, this was supposed to be just for me

04:07.341 --> 04:09.343
and my hopefully
soon-to-be friends at work.

04:09.343 --> 04:12.296
And her fabulous new roomie.

04:12.985 --> 04:14.912
Hello, Jennifer.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.954
You asked Bonnie Wheeler
to join your book club?

04:19.160 --> 04:20.706
Is it a picture book club?

04:20.774 --> 04:22.427
(Mock laughing)

04:23.240 --> 04:25.148
That's not exactly how it went down.

04:25.342 --> 04:27.795
I asked you to start a book
club with me three times.

04:28.057 --> 04:29.490
Oh, no go, Jenny-o.

04:29.528 --> 04:31.323
Single gals only, you know?

04:31.443 --> 04:32.969
The kind who like to spend their time

04:33.007 --> 04:34.621
clubbing or sexting or

04:34.741 --> 04:37.199
doing stuff that we'll
pretend to regret tomorrow.

04:37.224 --> 04:38.450
Riley!

04:39.426 --> 04:41.009
I don't do any of those things.

04:41.766 --> 04:43.242
And the day started so well

04:43.299 --> 04:44.700
when I pulled out of my driveway

04:44.713 --> 04:46.940
and finally saw a sold sign on your lawn.

04:47.060 --> 04:49.017
Well, I kept putting one on yours,

04:49.030 --> 04:50.881
but you never took the hint.

04:51.645 --> 04:54.473
I'm so sorry that our firm
couldn't handle your listing,

04:54.660 --> 04:56.450
but we really don't do fixer uppers.

04:56.719 --> 04:58.640
Tell that to your plastic surgeon.

05:00.279 --> 05:01.762
Ben, Ben, help.

05:01.825 --> 05:03.148
Sorry.

05:03.149 --> 05:05.172
It's like driving past a horrible accident.

05:05.241 --> 05:06.633
You know you should stop and help,

05:06.667 --> 05:07.868
but who's got the time?

05:07.868 --> 05:09.946
(Chuckles) Bye.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.239
Hey, hold the elevator.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.891
Okay. Thanks.

05:21.534 --> 05:23.904
I don't think I've seen you
around the building before.

05:23.947 --> 05:25.537
And I'm very observant.

05:25.538 --> 05:27.172
We just moved in Thursday.

05:27.173 --> 05:29.342
And that's "we" as in
you and your little...

05:30.717 --> 05:32.350
Yellow's always kind of a crap shoot.

05:32.470 --> 05:34.459
(Chuckles) Boy. Justin.

05:34.579 --> 05:36.642
And is he the only man in your life?

05:36.686 --> 05:38.288
Yep. Just us.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.722
I'm Kayla. 5D.

05:40.784 --> 05:42.430
Ben and Emma, 4D.

05:42.605 --> 05:44.451
Which means you're right on top of me.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.809
I'm sorry, my mind went somewhere.

05:52.103 --> 05:53.699
Maybe we can have a playdate sometime.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.582
You can even bring the baby if you wanted.

05:55.702 --> 05:57.176
(Chuckles)

05:57.704 --> 05:59.316
Wait a second, 4D?

05:59.353 --> 06:00.886
You must be Tucker's roommate.

06:01.068 --> 06:02.175
You already met Tucker?

06:02.381 --> 06:03.709
Oh, he's so sweet.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.673
I'm having him over for dinner tonight.

06:05.704 --> 06:06.711
He helped me move in.

06:06.780 --> 06:08.219
He's always moving in on something.

06:08.257 --> 06:09.477
(Elevator dings)

06:10.978 --> 06:13.381
Oh, perfect timing, Emma.

06:13.501 --> 06:15.001
Ready to knock back a cold one

06:15.020 --> 06:16.284
with your Uncle Danny?

06:17.222 --> 06:18.429
Hey, if you're still hungry,

06:18.486 --> 06:20.131
you can have half my hoagie.

06:20.427 --> 06:22.903
Dude, not every baby can
eat a hoagie at six months.

06:23.541 --> 06:24.697
You were the exception.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.172
I know. That's why I was
gonna put it in the blender.

06:30.303 --> 06:31.581
Oh hey, man. What's going on?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.527
Just met the new mom up in 5D.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.410
Oh, the future Mrs. Tucker Dobbs?

06:35.467 --> 06:36.649
(Laughs)

06:37.110 --> 06:38.714
Yeah, you can step away right now

06:38.745 --> 06:40.385
because I have already put my scent

06:40.399 --> 06:41.962
just all over that.

06:44.007 --> 06:46.128
Ben, where's Lamby?

06:46.248 --> 06:47.311
He's in there.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.337
I finally wised up and put him on a leash.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.958
This leash?

06:51.014 --> 06:52.666
Dude, Lamby's not in here.

06:52.891 --> 06:54.899
You lost Lamby? What is wrong with you?

06:54.880 --> 06:55.694
(Murmurs)

06:55.913 --> 06:57.533
It's okay. He's definitely in the building.

06:57.577 --> 06:59.128
I just heard his "baaa" in the lobby

06:59.110 --> 07:00.524
when I was going through
other people's magazines.

07:00.511 --> 07:01.819
I'll be right back.

07:02.826 --> 07:05.070
Okay, appetizers are all done.

07:05.190 --> 07:07.512
Now I just have to type
up some talking points.

07:07.568 --> 07:09.039
They're always so helpful.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.110
Especially for people who
haven't bothered to read the book.

07:11.955 --> 07:13.225
Riley, did I ever tell you about

07:13.237 --> 07:14.908
your mom and I at senior prom?

07:15.028 --> 07:16.496
All I remember hearing is

07:16.515 --> 07:18.548
"Bonnie, don't drink all the limo liquor.

07:18.586 --> 07:19.937
Bonnie, stay out of the moon roof.

07:19.994 --> 07:21.995
Bonnie, quit making out with my date."

07:23.322 --> 07:25.918
Did I ever tell you that
I dated Ray Wheeler first?

07:26.038 --> 07:28.476
He was devastated when I broke up with him.

07:28.545 --> 07:31.054
Well, your Bob was practically suicidal

07:31.067 --> 07:32.656
when I broke up with him.

07:32.681 --> 07:34.733
So I would say we're pretty even.

07:34.853 --> 07:37.630
Hardly. Ray left you for another man.

07:37.699 --> 07:39.257
I'm still married to Bob.

07:40.201 --> 07:41.722
Sounds pretty even to me.

07:42.509 --> 07:44.068
Um, hey mom.

07:44.099 --> 07:45.795
If I could just get your opinion on...

07:45.915 --> 07:47.303
Please, I am begging you.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.255
Do not let Mrs. Wheeler push your buttons.

07:48.059 --> 07:50.512
Darling, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

07:50.768 --> 07:52.921
Hey, Riley. Do they have pictures online

07:52.964 --> 07:54.447
of all the lawyers at your firm?

07:54.503 --> 07:56.765
I thought we could play a few
rounds of "who'd you rather?"

07:56.815 --> 07:59.155
Wouldn't it just be easier
to play "who you haven't?"

08:02.852 --> 08:05.274
That. That is what I am talking about.

08:05.394 --> 08:07.245
You can't be all crazy
competitive with her.

08:07.245 --> 08:09.085
Not tonight. Please?

08:09.285 --> 08:10.949
I'm really trying to impress these girls.

08:10.961 --> 08:12.694
You know, I want to be
able to walk down the hall

08:12.712 --> 08:13.927
and have people say "hey, Riles,

08:13.933 --> 08:15.228
how'd the deposition go?" or

08:15.266 --> 08:16.404
"what case are you working on?" or

08:16.411 --> 08:17.443
"cute skirt."

08:17.505 --> 08:18.857
You know, lawyer-y things.

08:20.358 --> 08:21.197
Okay, honey.

08:21.317 --> 08:23.368
From now on, you will have my full focus

08:23.556 --> 08:26.725
to make sure that you
have the perfect book club.

08:27.272 --> 08:29.080
You're not wearing that, are you?

08:34.248 --> 08:35.775
Hi, it's Ben from the elevator.

08:35.802 --> 08:38.653
Shh. Just putting Justin down for a nap.

08:39.005 --> 08:40.472
Oh, sorry.

08:40.472 --> 08:41.769
We're having a bit of a crisis.

08:41.756 --> 08:43.121
Emma lost her stuffed lamb

08:43.145 --> 08:44.879
and I'm pretty sure the only
place she could have dropped it

08:44.891 --> 08:46.656
was in the elevator. Did you see it?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.014
No. Sorry.

08:48.014 --> 08:49.749
- Good luck.
- (Sighs)

08:51.686 --> 08:52.725
(Lamby bleats)

08:54.395 --> 08:55.446
(Bleating continues)

09:01.740 --> 09:03.829
Did you miss the part about the nap?

09:03.830 --> 09:05.719
Sorry, but I couldn't help but notice

09:05.744 --> 09:07.432
that you stole my kid's toy.

09:07.871 --> 09:09.348
This is Sheepy.

09:09.836 --> 09:11.556
Wow, clever.

09:11.575 --> 09:13.076
But I'm really gonna have
to take back that lamb.

09:13.070 --> 09:13.940
- Okay.
- What?

09:14.616 --> 09:16.508
What is the matter with you?

09:16.509 --> 09:17.777
(Grunts)

09:19.032 --> 09:20.232
(Lamby bleats)

09:20.915 --> 09:21.879
Don't worry, Lamby.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.316
We're coming to get you.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.522
Look who I found, Emma.

09:28.713 --> 09:30.180
(Bleats)

09:31.267 --> 09:32.716
(Bleats)

09:33.075 --> 09:34.202
She's not buying it.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.154
Sweat sock Lamby's a no go.

09:37.261 --> 09:38.789
Tucker, you're our only hope.

09:39.168 --> 09:40.238
Come on.

09:40.245 --> 09:42.015
Kayla is the first hot girl to ever

09:42.021 --> 09:43.235
move into this building.

09:43.355 --> 09:45.525
Sure, she's a psychotic kleptomaniac,

09:45.550 --> 09:48.015
but there is a lot to
be said for convenience.

09:48.772 --> 09:50.618
Look into that face and tell her

09:50.637 --> 09:52.236
you're putting your needs above hers.

09:55.499 --> 09:57.907
How am I even supposed to get him out?

09:58.176 --> 09:59.634
Easy.

09:59.909 --> 10:02.143
Locate Lamby, distract Kayla,

10:02.263 --> 10:04.188
knock three times on the floor
when she's out of the room,

10:04.226 --> 10:05.208
throw him out of the door,

10:05.208 --> 10:07.391
and we'll be there to make the pickup.

10:07.967 --> 10:11.013
If I get Lamby back,
then can I close the deal?

10:11.307 --> 10:13.728
- Yeah, whatever. Sure, yeah.
- I don't see why not.

10:14.548 --> 10:15.843
(Laughing)

10:15.963 --> 10:17.683
And next to the Indian place

10:17.726 --> 10:21.124
is this falafel place that
will knock your socks off.

10:21.244 --> 10:23.733
Which comes in handy
because right next to that

10:23.746 --> 10:25.410
is a Korean foot massage place.

10:25.460 --> 10:26.423
(Laughing)

10:26.492 --> 10:28.682
Oh, my... I love a good foot massage.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.446
Oh, well then you should go there.

10:30.566 --> 10:32.754
Or... oh look. I have hands.

10:32.773 --> 10:34.362
(Both laughing)

10:34.482 --> 10:36.852
How could somebody so funny and sweet

10:36.865 --> 10:39.630
end up with a roommate
that's such a wack-a-doodle?

10:39.643 --> 10:40.975
(Chuckles)

10:41.095 --> 10:42.602
Hey, let's be honest,

10:42.615 --> 10:44.656
if I didn't take him in, then who would?

10:44.776 --> 10:45.467
(Chuckles)

10:45.461 --> 10:47.101
Well, you and your hands stay put.

10:47.157 --> 10:48.696
I'm just gonna go check on Justin.

10:48.971 --> 10:50.615
We will be right here.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:05.964 --> 11:07.302
(Bleats)

11:13.089 --> 11:14.428
What are you doing?

11:15.679 --> 11:17.074
Nothing.

11:17.525 --> 11:18.809
Tucker?

11:18.810 --> 11:20.678
Um...

11:26.071 --> 11:27.348
(Bleats)

11:32.115 --> 11:33.448
Did you get it?

11:33.568 --> 11:34.791
Where's Lamby?

11:36.025 --> 11:37.789
I think we need a new plan.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.151
Well, I definitely think
the most surprising aspect

11:42.144 --> 11:43.433
of the book was the ending.

11:43.890 --> 11:46.780
So I guess you could call
that a surprise ending.

11:48.238 --> 11:49.702
Well said, darling.

11:49.884 --> 11:51.266
This might be the perfect time

11:51.272 --> 11:52.605
to hand out my work sheets.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.726
Oh good. I was looking for a place

11:54.719 --> 11:56.096
to dump my mushroom cap.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.259
(Chuckles)

11:57.379 --> 11:58.955
Now let's get to the good stuff.

11:58.967 --> 12:01.851
Like who is sleeping
with who at the office.

12:02.170 --> 12:03.821
You look like you have some stories.

12:04.923 --> 12:06.544
Oh, if you want to hear stories,

12:06.556 --> 12:08.427
you should ask her how
she got her nickname.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.416
"Behind the bleachers Bonnie."

12:10.536 --> 12:11.717
You'll never guess.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.553
Mom, you were saying something
fascinating about work sheets?

12:15.578 --> 12:16.842
Oh, yes. Right.

12:17.267 --> 12:19.403
I've divided it by chapters.

12:19.404 --> 12:20.464
I think you'll be very impressed.

12:20.584 --> 12:22.785
Well, Jenn, if you really
want to impress these girls,

12:22.835 --> 12:25.682
you should show them your before pictures.

12:25.802 --> 12:27.283
Ginormous.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.681
Not unlike our novel's heroine, joanna,

12:30.801 --> 12:33.834
who had a ginormous problem
with letting things go.

12:33.903 --> 12:35.098
Any thoughts on that, mother?

12:35.117 --> 12:37.244
Yes, actually I do.

12:37.364 --> 12:39.771
I think the most tragic part of the novel

12:39.790 --> 12:41.047
is how the antagonist

12:41.097 --> 12:43.756
is always making herself
the center of attention.

12:43.876 --> 12:46.503
Hmm. You know what's even more tragic?

12:46.623 --> 12:49.137
That our dull as a box of hair villain

12:49.174 --> 12:52.090
hasn't met a party that she
can't suck the fun out of.

12:52.628 --> 12:53.629
Not fun?

12:53.654 --> 12:55.575
Did you miss the chapter where the heroine

12:55.600 --> 12:57.340
becomes head cheerleader?

12:57.342 --> 12:58.323
Oh, no no. I read it.

12:58.335 --> 13:00.882
It was after the chapter where her father

13:00.938 --> 13:02.658
bribed the coach!

13:03.548 --> 13:05.016
I totally missed that.

13:07.012 --> 13:08.639
(Knocking on door)

13:15.890 --> 13:17.079
Can I help you?

13:17.199 --> 13:18.843
Yeah, hi.

13:18.963 --> 13:20.288
I'm...

13:20.832 --> 13:21.928
Juan.

13:22.597 --> 13:25.881
And this is my daughter juanita.

13:26.983 --> 13:29.354
We're part of the "welcome
to the building" committee.

13:29.347 --> 13:30.974
And I was just wondering if I could ask you

13:30.974 --> 13:32.344
a few quick questions.

13:32.610 --> 13:35.472
Go ahead, Juan.

13:35.778 --> 13:37.605
Great. So.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.608
What do you think of the building so far?

13:40.425 --> 13:42.548
Honestly, not a huge fan.

13:46.546 --> 13:47.879
Ow.

13:50.156 --> 13:52.033
Help me, help me, help me.

13:55.975 --> 13:57.108
Remember,

13:57.228 --> 13:58.847
we have to keep quiet.

13:59.035 --> 14:00.299
That means you too, Justin.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.926
(Floor creaks)

14:02.420 --> 14:03.859
Did you hear something?

14:03.872 --> 14:05.317
No. Did you?

14:05.437 --> 14:06.580
Yes. Excuse me.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.757
No no, come back. Your kid's fine!

14:09.514 --> 14:11.610
- Got it!
- She's coming!

14:11.635 --> 14:13.258
Go go go go go.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.303
What the hell is going on in here?

14:17.322 --> 14:18.911
I am calling the police.

14:20.031 --> 14:21.564
Tucker?

14:24.761 --> 14:26.571
Hey, Kayla.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.309
How about that foot massage?

14:32.186 --> 14:34.463
Oh my God, Jennifer. Let it go.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.397
Nobody cares that you
were homecoming queen.

14:37.466 --> 14:40.169
And besides, the only
thing that was stuffed more

14:40.200 --> 14:42.684
than your bra was the ballot box.

14:43.792 --> 14:46.288
That is exactly what
someone who lost would say.

14:46.408 --> 14:47.821
And by the way, the only reason

14:47.871 --> 14:50.030
you were ever elected President of the PTA

14:50.099 --> 14:51.582
was because of your pool parties

14:51.619 --> 14:53.165
and your frozen Margarita machine.

14:53.285 --> 14:55.010
Well, it certainly didn't stop you

14:55.029 --> 14:57.801
from knocking them
back. Gluggity glug glug.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.798
Maybe we should go.

15:00.842 --> 15:02.644
Oh no, please stay.

15:02.907 --> 15:04.571
That's such a cute skirt.

15:05.791 --> 15:07.505
I guess I should just count myself lucky

15:07.518 --> 15:09.138
that those two delinquents of yours

15:09.138 --> 15:10.595
haven't rubbed off on my daughter

15:10.615 --> 15:11.953
any more than they already have.

15:12.073 --> 15:15.306
At least I'm not the
one being called grandma.

15:18.435 --> 15:20.174
I can't believe you went there.

15:23.571 --> 15:25.893
You know what? You should
probably get out while you can.

15:26.631 --> 15:28.176
Let me tell you something.

15:28.176 --> 15:29.697
Emma is the best thing

15:29.703 --> 15:31.392
that has ever happened to this family.

15:31.461 --> 15:34.058
And I am proud of Ben and
the decisions he's made.

15:34.114 --> 15:35.834
Because of her, he has grown up

15:35.853 --> 15:39.200
to be a mature, caring, responsible adult.

15:40.094 --> 15:41.233
The cops are after us.

15:41.277 --> 15:42.484
We just broke into our
neighbor's apartment.

15:42.497 --> 15:43.923
You have to hide us.

15:44.906 --> 15:47.082
You took Emma on a heist?

15:47.595 --> 15:48.872
See?

15:49.053 --> 15:51.167
Most fathers wouldn't do that.

15:54.152 --> 15:56.366
Again, I am so sorry.

15:56.486 --> 15:58.450
So I'll see you at lunch tomorrow?

15:58.869 --> 16:00.677
Okay, we'll play it by ear.

16:02.391 --> 16:03.505
What is wrong with you?

16:03.699 --> 16:06.417
Oh, sorry. I thought
these were for everyone.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.952
Not you two.

16:10.072 --> 16:11.097
You two.

16:11.109 --> 16:13.036
You got me kicked out before I was even in.

16:13.030 --> 16:14.920
I was just trying to make some friends.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.484
Have you tried a Margarita machine?

16:19.946 --> 16:21.320
Well, you should have thought about that

16:21.342 --> 16:23.037
before you invited her.

16:23.157 --> 16:25.076
Mom, you said you would control yourself.

16:25.196 --> 16:28.192
Yes, Mrs. Wheeler is loud

16:28.312 --> 16:29.981
and crass and opinionated.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.664
But she has one of the biggest hearts

16:31.683 --> 16:32.977
of anyone I've ever met.

16:33.097 --> 16:35.105
See? She gets me.

16:36.970 --> 16:38.984
Are you saying that this is my fault?

16:39.316 --> 16:41.218
You are missing the point.

16:41.338 --> 16:43.414
You're my mom, and it would be so nice

16:43.426 --> 16:46.098
if for once in my life,
you actually had my back.

16:46.536 --> 16:49.220
Like it or not, the
Wheelers are my family too.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.473
And now if you'll excuse me,

16:58.593 --> 17:00.481
I have to go help two delinquents

17:00.494 --> 17:01.970
stay out of jail.

17:02.696 --> 17:04.204
Oh, she's talking about us.

17:05.718 --> 17:07.094
Do we really have to do this?

17:07.132 --> 17:08.508
You don't know how lucky you are.

17:08.508 --> 17:09.722
She agreed to drop the charges

17:09.733 --> 17:11.505
and all you have to do is
give back that fluff ball

17:11.560 --> 17:12.842
and apologize.

17:12.863 --> 17:14.531
(Knocking on door)

17:16.916 --> 17:19.300
Hi. Sorry, we know it's
late, but we just...

17:19.301 --> 17:21.233
We really wanted to get
this cleared up tonight.

17:22.016 --> 17:22.954
Ben.

17:23.130 --> 17:24.042
Tucker.

17:24.931 --> 17:26.342
Juan.

17:28.465 --> 17:29.717
Boys?

17:31.332 --> 17:33.321
All: We're sorry.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.919
Ben, give her back the lamb.

17:44.415 --> 17:45.728
No. I can't do it.

17:45.904 --> 17:46.779
Ben, it's just a toy.

17:46.786 --> 17:47.937
No, it's not.

17:48.057 --> 17:49.651
That's my whole point.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.003
This is the first thing

17:51.034 --> 17:53.192
I ever gave to Emma and she loves it.

17:53.975 --> 17:55.213
And I know I'm not the perfect dad

17:55.232 --> 17:57.822
and this probably wasn't the
best way to handle things,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.381
but there's no way I
can look into those eyes

18:00.406 --> 18:02.127
and tell her I just let someone take it.

18:04.017 --> 18:05.487
One day Emma will grow up

18:05.525 --> 18:06.901
and be able to fight her own battles.

18:06.970 --> 18:09.635
But for now, it's my job.

18:10.561 --> 18:12.300
And I'm not gonna let her down.

18:14.359 --> 18:17.124
Oh my God. It's just
a stupid stuffed sheep.

18:18.858 --> 18:20.265
Okay, if I let you keep it,

18:20.278 --> 18:21.560
will you go away and promise never

18:21.554 --> 18:22.906
to speak to me again?

18:23.433 --> 18:24.338
All of us?

18:24.376 --> 18:25.696
All of you.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.718
Deal.

18:32.275 --> 18:33.511
Yes!

18:33.543 --> 18:35.256
I can't believe it. We won.

18:35.275 --> 18:38.185
- Thank you.
- I had nothing to do with it.

18:38.660 --> 18:39.754
Emma's a lucky girl.

18:40.283 --> 18:41.393
She may not always understand

18:41.412 --> 18:43.051
why you do what you do,

18:43.427 --> 18:44.835
but she'll always love you.

18:49.626 --> 18:51.160
(Elevator dings)

18:51.548 --> 18:52.574
Juan?

18:54.244 --> 18:56.221
I was gonna tell her I was from the future,

18:56.228 --> 18:58.299
but I thought she might see through that.

19:01.996 --> 19:02.947
You're back.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.705
I'm almost done cleaning up.

19:05.050 --> 19:07.275
- Oh, mom. You don't have to do that.
- I know.

19:07.890 --> 19:08.941
Is she asleep?

19:09.123 --> 19:11.413
Yeah. I think she's out.

19:11.725 --> 19:13.327
(Sighs)

19:13.514 --> 19:16.155
So, I'm sorry for getting so upset earlier.

19:16.205 --> 19:17.863
I'm sorry that you had to.

19:18.044 --> 19:19.671
I just... I don't
understand why you let her

19:19.665 --> 19:20.666
bother you so much.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.042
Maybe it's because

19:22.048 --> 19:24.132
everything with her is a competition.

19:24.465 --> 19:26.755
- Even you.
- What do you mean?

19:26.875 --> 19:28.995
You spent every waking
hour at the Wheelers.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.600
I practically had to drag you
home for dinner every night.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.319
Well, they didn't have a lot of rules.

19:34.963 --> 19:36.277
They were fun.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.318
Something your mother is decidedly not.

19:39.530 --> 19:41.032
Is that what this is about?

19:41.152 --> 19:43.278
You're jealous of Mrs. Wheeler?

19:43.654 --> 19:46.069
Well, I guess I just always felt that...

19:46.594 --> 19:48.596
maybe you loved her more than you loved me.

19:48.959 --> 19:51.074
That is so truly absurd.

19:51.274 --> 19:53.614
Yes, I consider them family,

19:53.734 --> 19:55.091
but you're my mom.

19:55.211 --> 19:57.392
And I may not always understand

19:57.393 --> 19:58.619
why you do what you do,

19:58.657 --> 19:59.858
but I'll always love you.

20:00.139 --> 20:01.303
Mm.

20:01.665 --> 20:03.692
I love you too, honey.

20:04.399 --> 20:07.083
Let's do something really fun this week.

20:07.678 --> 20:08.873
The planetarium.

20:10.105 --> 20:11.640
Sounds great.

20:11.908 --> 20:13.835
All right, well, drive safe.

20:13.955 --> 20:15.311
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.316
Not a word.

20:19.353 --> 20:21.149
I always knew she was jealous.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.753
And finally the princess

20:27.746 --> 20:29.667
could go off to sleep with her best friends

20:29.723 --> 20:30.931
Douglas the wonder dog...

20:30.975 --> 20:32.051
(Barks)

20:33.083 --> 20:35.035
Monica, the squish-faced hippo...

20:35.770 --> 20:36.904
(Meows)

20:38.576 --> 20:40.284
and most important of all,

20:40.404 --> 20:41.716
Lamby.

20:43.362 --> 20:44.626
Guys?

20:44.895 --> 20:46.058
Oh.

20:49.330 --> 20:51.082
- Got it.
- Got it.

20:54.439 --> 20:56.341
I guess Kayla didn't steal it after all.

20:57.593 --> 20:58.993
Ben?

20:59.902 --> 21:03.318
And everyone in the kingdom
lived happily ever after,

21:03.380 --> 21:05.251
thanks to two stuffed lambs,

21:05.371 --> 21:07.272
one angry neighbor,

21:07.328 --> 21:08.961
two awesome uncles,

21:09.249 --> 21:11.332
and a dad who probably should
have checked under the couch.

21:11.708 --> 21:13.360
The end.

21:13.422 --> 21:14.498
