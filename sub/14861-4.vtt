WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.673
HEY, DID YOU GUYS
GET MY E-MAIL?

00:02.673 --> 00:04.135
YOU DIDN'T REPLY.

00:04.135 --> 00:05.036
I GOT IT. I JUST DIDN'T READ IT.

00:05.036 --> 00:06.607
I GOT IT, TOO.
WENT RIGHT IN THE TRASH.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.079
WHY?

00:08.079 --> 00:09.080
YOUR E-MAILS ARE BORING,
WILL.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.441
WELL, IF YOUHADREAD IT,
YOU WOULD KNOW

00:10.441 --> 00:12.783
THAT IT HAD DETAILS ABOUT
GOING TO THE CLUB TONIGHT.

00:12.783 --> 00:15.286
AH, YES, TONIGHT.
WE ARE GETTING KENNY HAYDEN

00:15.286 --> 00:17.348
A MAIDEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE...

00:17.348 --> 00:19.190
IT MIGHT EVEN BE
THE LAST CENTURY.

00:19.190 --> 00:20.551
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG.

00:20.551 --> 00:22.523
YOU'VE BEEN DIVORCED
OVER SIX MONTHS.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.024
YEAH, AND YOU MOVED IN WITH ME
SIX MONTHS BEFORE THAT,

00:24.024 --> 00:25.626
AND I HAVENOTCLOCKED
ANY SEXUAL ACTIVITY

00:25.626 --> 00:27.728
OTHER THAN SOME
VERY LONG BATHS.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.201
FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I TAKE
ACTION FIGURES INTO THE TUB,

00:30.201 --> 00:32.133
AND I PLAY OUT
MARITIME SCENARIOS.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.734

00:41.072 --> 00:42.543
AND SOMEHOW KENNY HAS SEX.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.575
I LOVE THIS PLAN.
IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

00:44.575 --> 00:47.148
REMEMBER, WHEN WE TALK TO
THERESA, WE'RE GOING OUT FOR...

00:47.148 --> 00:48.779
LOBSTERS.
BATTING CAGES.

00:48.779 --> 00:51.722
STEAKS! THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE
TO READ YOUR E-MAILS.

00:51.722 --> 00:53.084
I DON'T WANT THERESA KNOWING
THAT I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT

00:53.084 --> 00:56.127
IN A SINGLES BAR.
I MEAN, I'M NO DR. PHIL...

00:56.127 --> 00:57.057
(nasal voice)
NO, SIR. YOU ARE NOT.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.559
(Southern drawl)
NO, SIR. YOU ARE NOT.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.631
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT WOMEN DON'T LIKE

01:00.631 --> 01:02.333
THEIR HUSBANDS HANGING OUT
IN SINGLES BARS.
NO, SIR. THEY DO NOT.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.135
NO, SIR. THEYDONOT.

01:04.135 --> 01:05.696
GET IT OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM NOW,
FELLAS, BECAUSE TONIGHT

01:05.696 --> 01:08.469
AT THE CLUB, WOMEN ARE NOT
GOING TO RESPOND TO THIS.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.670
NO, SIR, THEY WILL NOT.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.143
DO YOU COME HERE OFTEN,
PRETTY FEMALE?

01:12.143 --> 01:14.575
BECAUSE YOU ARE GIVING MY HORSE
A TOUCH OF THE VAPORS.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.079
Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.312
(dog barking in distance)

01:21.312 --> 01:24.185
SO "EAT, PRAY, LOVE" IS
BASICALLY ABOUT THIS GIRL

01:24.185 --> 01:26.417
WHO GOES ON A JOURNEY
TO, YOU KNOW,

01:26.417 --> 01:28.219

01:31.091 --> 01:33.194
WELL... (sighs) SHE HAS
PRETTY INTENSE SEX IN INDONESIA.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.126
(singsongy)
BINGO! WHAT PAGE?

01:35.126 --> 01:36.197
HEY, WHY DON'T

01:36.197 --> 01:38.129
YOUR OWN BOOKS
FOR BOOK CLUB?

01:38.129 --> 01:39.400
(both) AW.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.333
(chuckles) HONEY,
BOOK CLUBS AREN'T ABOUT BOOKS.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.205
THEY'RE ABOUT GOSSIP
AND DRINKING WINE

01:44.205 --> 01:45.506
AND NO ONE ACKNOWLEDGING

01:45.506 --> 01:48.239
THE SHARED LIE THAT
WE ALL CARE ABOUT LITERATURE.

01:48.239 --> 01:49.510
OKAY, IF ANY OF YOU
EVER REFER TO THIS

01:49.510 --> 01:51.842
AS LITERATURE AGAIN,
I'M MOVING OUT.

01:51.842 --> 01:53.744

01:53.744 --> 01:56.247
HELLO, MS. KEEN.

01:56.247 --> 01:58.419
HELLO,MISS-TAKE.

02:00.821 --> 02:01.822
ABOUT A WEEK.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.194
HE WAS PRACTICING IT
IN THE CAR.

02:03.194 --> 02:04.395

02:04.395 --> 02:06.797
IS HE OUT UPGRADING
THE WOMAN IN HIS LIFE? ♪ HO ♪

02:06.797 --> 02:08.359
I GUESS THAT'S ALWAYS
A POSSIBILITY

02:08.359 --> 02:10.701
FOR AREALMAN LIKE HIM,
AS OPPOSED

02:10.701 --> 02:12.733
TO A TINY, BEARDED CREATURE
LIKE YOU,

02:12.733 --> 02:15.135
WHO LIVES UNDER A BRIDGE
AND EATS HOBBITS.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.308
FIRST OF ALL,
I WOULDN'T EAT HOBBITS.

02:17.308 --> 02:18.639
I'D ASK THEM RIDDLES.
DUH.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.611
SECONDLY, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF WOMEN OUT THERE FOR ME.

02:20.611 --> 02:22.843
SURE.
YOU'RE A PHARMACEUTICAL REP.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.375
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS WAIT FOR A GIRL

02:24.375 --> 02:26.146
TO LEAVE HER DRINK
UNATTENDED.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.649
WHAT? (chuckles) WH-WHY ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT GIRLS?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.181

02:32.183 --> 02:34.755
LOBSTERS.

02:36.387 --> 02:37.388
WE SHOULD GO.

02:37.388 --> 02:39.230
OKAY.

02:39.230 --> 02:43.634

02:43.634 --> 02:45.336
(indistinct conversations)

02:45.336 --> 02:46.367
(clink)

02:46.367 --> 02:47.538
IT'S A PICKLE PARTY IN HERE.

02:47.538 --> 02:48.539
THERE'S FOUR WOMEN
IN THE WHOLE PLACE.

02:48.539 --> 02:50.341
YOU ONLY NEED ONE, KENNY.

02:50.341 --> 02:53.844
WELL, SOMETIMES I ENJOY
TWO OR THREE FEMALES IN MY BED.

02:53.844 --> 02:55.676
OH, MY GOD.
HAVE YOU REALLY DONE THAT?

02:55.676 --> 02:58.609
NO, SIR. THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT
CHILLS ME.

03:00.911 --> 03:02.653
GRANT!

03:03.754 --> 03:05.386

NO. NO!

03:05.386 --> 03:06.487
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.259
I INVITED HIM. I THOUGHT
HE COULD HELP OUT.

03:08.259 --> 03:10.291
WILL, I REFUSE TO TRY
TO GET LAID FOR THE FIRST TIME

03:10.291 --> 03:11.892
SINCE MY EX-WIFE
WHILE BEING JUDGED

03:11.892 --> 03:14.295
BY THE GUY THAT IS CURRENTLY
DOING MY EX-WIFE.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.196
I'M SORRY. NO.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.372
OHH.

03:21.372 --> 03:23.234

THANK YOU FOR COMING.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.388
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, KEN.

03:37.388 --> 03:38.749
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

03:38.749 --> 03:39.750
(clenching teeth)
PLEASE TELL HIM TO STOP TALKING

03:39.750 --> 03:41.252
TO ME LIKE I HAVE CANCER.

03:41.252 --> 03:43.294
KENNY, KENNY, CHECK IT OUT.
10:00.

03:43.294 --> 03:45.426
SHE'S TOTALLY
CHECKING YOU OUT.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.459
NO, SHE'S NOT.
SHE'S LOOKING AT GRANT.

03:48.459 --> 03:50.601
NO, SHE'S LOOKING AT YOU.
OBSERVE.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.338
SHE'S LOOKING AT YOU,
BUDDY.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.270
(chuckles) OH.

04:00.571 --> 04:01.612
IT IS ME.

04:01.612 --> 04:03.614
SHE MIGHT BE BLIND.

04:03.614 --> 04:05.716
THEN MY CHANCES JUST DOUBLED.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.348
(clatter)
(sighs)

04:07.348 --> 04:08.619
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

04:08.619 --> 04:09.980
JUST SOME PHONE NUMBERS
AND A COUPLE OF ROOM KEYS.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.882
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET THOSE
WHEN YOU WALK ACROSS A BAR.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.287
ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING OVER.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.295
I'M GONNA NEED A WINGMAN.

04:24.295 --> 04:25.366
TAKE GRANT.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.767
NO WAY! I NEED TO PICK
THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE PERSON

04:26.767 --> 04:29.740
IN THE GROUP, SOMEONE WHO'S
NOT GONNA BE A THREAT.

04:29.740 --> 04:30.801
WILL, YOU'RE UP.

04:30.801 --> 04:31.872

04:31.872 --> 04:33.304
CRAIG'S TOO SEXY.

04:33.304 --> 04:35.446
WHAT?!
CRAIG'S SEXIER THAN ME?

04:35.446 --> 04:36.607
THAT "BLINK" RESPONSE.

04:36.607 --> 04:37.748
IT'S, LIKE,
THE FIRST IMPRESSION I GET

04:37.748 --> 04:39.380
WHEN I LOOK
AT THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.352
WATCH.
(scoffs)

04:41.352 --> 04:42.753
CRAIG'S SEXIER.

04:42.753 --> 04:44.455
W--YOU GOTTA GIVE ME
A CHANCE.

04:44.455 --> 04:45.916
FINE.

04:50.421 --> 04:51.792
IT'S DEFINITELY CRAIG.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.394
(chuckles)
I'M SORRY, WILL,

04:53.394 --> 04:54.995
BUT IF YOU COULD SEE
WHAT WE'RE SEEING, YOU'D AGREE.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.398
LOSE THE WEDDING RING.

04:58.629 --> 05:00.531
(grunts)

05:00.531 --> 05:04.034
GRANT, 12:00. CUTE BLONDE.
I NEED YOU TO WING FOR ME.

05:04.034 --> 05:05.476
YOU KEEP THAT REDHEAD BUSY.

05:05.476 --> 05:06.837
I WILL BE
YOUR WINGMAN, CRAIG,

05:06.837 --> 05:08.439
AND AN EXCELLENT WINGMAN
I WILL BE,

05:08.439 --> 05:10.581
BUT IF WE DO THIS,
WE DO IT MY WAY.

05:10.581 --> 05:12.343
YEAH. FINE. WHATEVER.

05:12.343 --> 05:15.986
SUCCESS IS
ALL IN THE DETAILS.

05:17.388 --> 05:20.451
FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR TARGET--
SHE'S CHEWING HER ICE.

05:20.451 --> 05:22.623
THIS GIRL CAME TO PLAY.
FOOTWEAR--JIMMY CHOO.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.324
SHE KNOWS MONEY.
THIS AIN'T GONNA BE CHEAP.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.656
WOW, YOU PICK UP
ON EVERYTHING.

05:25.656 --> 05:26.857
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S ALL IN THE DETAILS.

05:26.857 --> 05:28.759
NOW LOOK AT THE LAUGH LINES
AROUND HER EYES.

05:28.759 --> 05:31.061
SHE LIKES TO LAUGH.
OPEN WITH A JOKE.

05:31.061 --> 05:33.764
NO PROBLEM.
I HAVE A GREAT ONE.

05:33.764 --> 05:36.437
(slaps)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

05:36.437 --> 05:37.608
I HAD TO GET SOME COLOR
IN YOUR CHEEKS.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.410
YOU COULD HAVE WARNED ME.

05:39.410 --> 05:41.111
HOW YOU DOING?

05:41.111 --> 05:43.614
(chuckles) TRY TO KEEP
THIS QUIET, BUT, UH,

05:43.614 --> 05:45.876
I GOT A HALF A BAG OF RAZZLES
IN MY POCKET.

05:45.876 --> 05:47.848
IT'S THE CANDY
THAT BECOMES GUM.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.421
YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

05:50.421 --> 05:53.554
(chuckles) WELL, I DO
A VERY GOOD ROBOT VOICE.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.956
I ALSO HAD THE ORIGINAL IDEA
FOR ROLLERBLADES

05:55.956 --> 05:57.628
FOUR YEARS
BEFORE THEY CAME OUT.

05:57.628 --> 05:59.390
I CALLED THEM SKATE-A-ROOS.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.432
OH, I HAD THE ORIGINAL IDEA
FOR THE KANGAROO.

06:01.432 --> 06:03.764
I CALLED IT
A KANGAROO-A-ROO.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.065
I'M KENNY.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.066
I'M SHERI.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.367
HI.
(giggles)

06:07.367 --> 06:09.570
AND THEN THE CHIEF SAYS,
"YOU GOT IT BACKWARDS, BUDDY.

06:09.570 --> 06:12.643
THAT'SMY DAUGHTER.
THAT'SA WIENER PRESS."

06:12.643 --> 06:15.706
(laughs)

06:15.706 --> 06:16.747
OH, I FORGOT TO SAY

06:16.747 --> 06:19.510
THAT THIS TRIBE BUILDS
WIENER PRESSES.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.382
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME TRY IT AGAIN.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.414
UH, I-I THINK...
THE--

06:23.414 --> 06:25.556
TWICE IS ENOUGH.

06:25.556 --> 06:27.057
I FEEL AS IF WE OWE
YOU LADIES A DRINK.

06:27.057 --> 06:28.388
BUY THEM A DRINK.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.389
OH, RIGHT.
(chuckles)

06:29.389 --> 06:31.121
RAZZLES ARE INCREDIBLE.

06:31.121 --> 06:33.163
SOMETIMES I EAT THEM
IN A BOWL WITH MILK.

06:33.163 --> 06:34.425
STICK WITH ME, BABY.
I'M GONNA HAVE YOU BATHING

06:34.425 --> 06:36.567
IN A BOWL OF RAZZLES
BY MIDNIGHT.

06:36.567 --> 06:37.828
OOH. (chuckles)

06:37.828 --> 06:39.399
NOT IN A SEXUAL WAY.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.531
I MEAN, I'M JUST GONNA
STOP BY THE STORE

06:40.531 --> 06:41.632
AND PICK YOU UP
A BAG OF RAZZLES.

06:41.632 --> 06:43.173
YOU CAN PUT IT
IN YOUR BATHTUB.

06:43.173 --> 06:45.536
OR MAYBE WE DON'T STOP
AT THE STORE.

06:45.536 --> 06:46.807
OH.

06:48.679 --> 06:52.042
THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING
ALONG WELL.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.644
I'M MOLLY.

06:53.644 --> 06:54.645
I'M WILL. (chuckles)

06:54.645 --> 06:55.916
WILL KEEN.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.147
WHAT? HELLO?

06:57.147 --> 06:59.450
VICKI BARKER.
I'M IN THERESA'S BOOK CLUB.

06:59.450 --> 07:02.853
RIGHT! (chuckles) RIGHT.
OF COURSE. "EAT, PRAY, LOVE."

07:02.853 --> 07:05.526
(chuckles)
IS YOUR WIFE WITH YOU?

07:05.526 --> 07:09.900
UH... SHE IS... NOT. NO.

07:09.900 --> 07:13.604
DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE HERE
WITHOUT YOUR WEDDING RING ON?

07:13.604 --> 07:15.506
UH, UH, DOES SHE KNOW?
DOES SHE KNOW?

07:15.506 --> 07:17.437
THAT--THAT IS
A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.710
UH, NOW YOU GOT ME
WONDERING ABOUT THAT.

07:19.710 --> 07:22.613
UH, I'M GONNA CALL HER.
NO NEED FOR YOU TO DO THAT.

07:22.613 --> 07:23.744
OH. (chuckles)

07:32.753 --> 07:33.924
HEY, HONEY.

07:33.924 --> 07:35.085
HELLO.

07:35.085 --> 07:37.788
HI.HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

07:37.788 --> 07:38.929
CRAZY.

07:38.929 --> 07:40.691
I WAS TRYING TO GET THINGS READY
FOR BOOK CLUB TOMORROW,

07:40.691 --> 07:44.064
AND I LEFT THE BACK DOOR OPEN,
AND A DEER GOT IN THE HOUSE.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.696
GOOD, GOOD, UH,
SO HERE'S SOMETHING

07:45.696 --> 07:46.697
THAT HAPPENED TONIGHT.

07:46.697 --> 07:49.540
UH, WE DID NOT GO OUT
FOR STEAKS.

07:49.540 --> 07:52.242
WE WENT TO A SINGLES CLUB
TO MEET GIRLS.

07:52.242 --> 07:54.845
UH, FOR KENNY. (chuckles)
I MEAN, NOT FOR ME.

07:54.845 --> 07:56.577
(chuckles) UH, I-I'M GOOD
IN THAT AREA.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.248
I AMGREATIN THAT AREA.

07:58.248 --> 07:59.980
DID YOU SAY A DEER GOT
INTO THE HOUSE?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.251
IT WAS CHAOS,
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE

08:01.251 --> 08:03.584
YOUR STORY'S GONNA BE
EVEN MORE INTERESTING.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.885
UH, IT'S--IT'S REALLY NOT.

08:04.885 --> 08:09.159
UH, SO I-I WAS WINGMANNING
FOR YOUR BROTHER... KENNY...

08:09.159 --> 08:11.061
I KNOW MY BROTHER'S NAME.
GO ON.

08:11.061 --> 08:13.223
AND, UH, I HAD
MY WEDDING RING OFF,

08:13.223 --> 08:16.066
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF
THE WINGMANNING THING,

08:16.066 --> 08:19.700
AND, UH, VICKI BARKER SAW ME
TALKING TO THIS WOMAN,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.572
BUT IT WAS NOTHING.

08:21.572 --> 08:22.773
NOTHING HAPPENED.

08:22.773 --> 08:25.175
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP
YOUR BROTHER... KENNY,

08:25.175 --> 08:27.077
WHOSE NAME YOU KNOW.

08:27.077 --> 08:30.080
(laughs) OH, GOD.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.112
THAT'S IT?
OH, YOU HAD ME WORRIED.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.715
SO Y-YOU'RE NOT MAD?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.717
YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP
MY BROTHER. I THINK IT'S SWEET.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.988
(sighs)

08:37.988 --> 08:39.820
(laughs)

08:39.820 --> 08:40.821
OHH.

08:40.821 --> 08:41.952
MWAH.

08:41.952 --> 08:44.094
(chuckles) THANK GOD.

08:44.094 --> 08:45.225
I MEAN, OF ALL THE THINGS
I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT,

08:45.225 --> 08:47.257
YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR IS NOT
ONE OF THEM.

08:47.257 --> 08:50.200
EXACTLY. WAIT. WHAT?

08:50.200 --> 08:52.232
WHAT, YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.805
(scoffs) PLEASE.

08:54.805 --> 08:57.808
(laughing)

08:59.139 --> 09:01.842
(water runs in sink)

09:01.842 --> 09:02.973
SHE LAUGHED.
(coffeepot clatters)

09:02.973 --> 09:05.045
THE IDEA OF ME ATTRACTING
ANOTHER WOMAN

09:05.045 --> 09:07.547
MAKES THE WOMAN I MARRIED
LAUGH.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.020
YOU SHOULD TALK TO GRANT.
HE KNOWSEVERYTHINGABOUT WOMEN.

09:10.020 --> 09:12.052
LAST NIGHT, WE GO UP
TO THESE TWO LADIES.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.654
I TOTALLY FLAME OUT.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.725
WIENER PRESS JOKE?

09:14.725 --> 09:16.026
YEAH, I TOLD IT WRONG AGAIN.

09:16.026 --> 09:18.128
ANYWAY, GRANT PULLS ME
FROM THE WRECKAGE,

09:18.128 --> 09:20.030
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER DATE
WITH THEM TONIGHT.

09:20.030 --> 09:23.033
THE GUY IS A MIRACLE WORKER.
BEST WINGMAN EVER.

09:23.033 --> 09:24.264
I DON'T NEED A WINGMAN.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.266
I JUST WANT MY WIFE
TO RECOGNIZE THAT OTHER WOMEN

09:26.266 --> 09:29.239
MIGHT POSSIBLY, CRAZILY WANT
TO HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH ME.

09:29.239 --> 09:33.173
HEY, TONY. HEY, HEY.
YOU HAVE AFFAIRS, RIGHT?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.775
LOTS OF 'EM. (chuckles)

09:34.775 --> 09:37.077
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED--
EIGHTH FLOOR. TONS OF TAIL.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.609
WELL, I-I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE AN AFFAIR.

09:38.609 --> 09:40.050
I JUST WANT MY WIFE TO THINK
THAT ICOULDHAVE AN AFFAIR.

09:40.050 --> 09:42.753
THEN YOU GOTTA BE SEXY, DUDE.
YOU GOTTA DRESS SEXY.

09:42.753 --> 09:44.815
YOU GOTTA ACT SEXY.
YOU GOTTA TALK SEXY.

09:44.815 --> 09:46.817
YOU GOTTA EAT SEXY.
YOU GOTTA SLEEP SEXY.

09:46.817 --> 09:48.318
COULD YOU WALK
OVER THERE SEXY?

09:48.318 --> 09:50.991
(chuckles)
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.193
YOU KNOW, THAT GUY IS
A HARASSMENT SUIT

09:53.193 --> 09:55.095
WAITING TO HAPPEN,
BUT HE MAKES A GOOD POINT.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.927
I'VE GOTTA UP MY GAME.

09:56.927 --> 09:59.329
HEY. WHERE YOU GUYS BEEN?
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR YOU.

09:59.329 --> 10:00.931
WE WERE RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE DOOR.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.703
I DID NOT LOOK THERE.
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.335
OH, RIGHT!
LAST NIGHT--HOW'D IT GO?

10:05.335 --> 10:08.038
NOTHING... HAPPENED.

10:08.038 --> 10:10.080
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE NEED DETAILS.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.843
OKAY, HERE ARE THE DETAILS.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

10:12.843 --> 10:14.715
(moaning)

10:14.715 --> 10:16.817
MM. (gasps)

10:16.817 --> 10:19.089
I WANT YOU TO COME
INTO MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

10:19.089 --> 10:21.091
(panting)
I'D REALLY LIKE TO,

10:21.091 --> 10:25.355
BUT I HAVE TO GET
TO MY... FIGHT CLUB.

10:25.355 --> 10:29.129
IF I'M LATE,
NO ONE WILL BEAT ME UP.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.961
I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT.
I PANICKED. I GOT NERVOUS.

10:30.961 --> 10:32.132
WHY?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.104
(clenches teeth) BECAUSE...

10:38.769 --> 10:41.241
I'VE NEVER HAD SEX
WITH ANYONE BUT BRENDA, OKAY?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.213
YOU MEAN
ANYONESINCEBRENDA.

10:43.213 --> 10:45.375
NO. (sighs)
I MEAN, MY WHOLE LIFE,

10:45.375 --> 10:49.049
I'VE NEVER HAD SEX
WITH ANYONE EXCEPT BRENDA.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.150
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.252
WHAT ABOUT LISA ELLIOT
SENIOR YEAR?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.653
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.685
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT, UH,

10:54.685 --> 10:55.686
THE GIRL FROM,
WHERE WAS IT, MICHIGAN?

10:55.686 --> 10:56.887
KERRY MACKINROOT,

10:56.887 --> 10:58.158
THE TAX ATTORNEY
WITH A DOG NAMED BOSCO

10:58.158 --> 11:00.130
WHO'D STARE AT ME ALL NIGHT
WHILE WE MADE LOVE.

11:00.130 --> 11:01.131
RIGHT.

11:01.131 --> 11:03.193
I MADE THE WHOLE THING UP.

11:03.193 --> 11:05.996
THE DOG STARING AT YOU--
THAT'S A BIZARRE DETAIL.

11:05.996 --> 11:07.838
DUH, THAT'S WHAT SOLD IT.

11:07.838 --> 11:09.840
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
MY HEAD IS SPINNING.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.271
NOBODY BUT BRENDA?

11:11.271 --> 11:13.173
YOU'RE, LIKE, ONE PERSON AWAY
FROM BEING A VIRGIN.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.174
(high-pitched voice)
SHUT UP!

11:14.174 --> 11:15.175
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER
TELL US?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.747
I TOLD YOU ABOUT
MY PETER JENNINGS DREAM,

11:16.747 --> 11:19.309
WHEN HE CARRIED ME ON THE BEACH
AND WHISPERED ME THE NEWS.

11:19.309 --> 11:23.914
YES, YOU DID.
I'MSORRY,OKAY?

11:23.914 --> 11:25.115
I GUESS I DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT TO YOU GUYS

11:25.115 --> 11:27.157
I'VE ONLY HAD SEX
WITH ONE WOMAN.

11:27.157 --> 11:29.219
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I'M ANY GOOD AT IT.

11:29.219 --> 11:30.861
(snaps)

11:30.861 --> 11:32.362
WILL, YOU'RE GONNA
CALL BRENDA

11:32.362 --> 11:34.224
AND ASK HER
IF I WAS ANY GOOD IN BED.

11:34.224 --> 11:35.225
(snaps)
KENNY, NO, I'M NOT.

11:35.225 --> 11:36.226
(snaps)
CRAIG.

11:36.226 --> 11:37.227
(snaps)
NO.

11:37.227 --> 11:38.228
(snaps)
DAMN.

11:38.228 --> 11:39.169
I'M AFRAID TO EVEN ASK

11:39.169 --> 11:40.871
ABOUT THE WOMAN FROM ALABAMA
WITH THE BANJO.

11:40.871 --> 11:44.004
OH. SUSANNA?

11:44.004 --> 11:49.009
OHH. HOW DID I NOT SEE THAT?

11:51.111 --> 11:54.214
HEY, T. I KNOW YOU HAVE
THE BOOK CLUB TONIGHT.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.947
I'M THINKING ABOUT GOING OUT,
SEEING WHAT THE BOYS ARE UP TO.

11:56.947 --> 11:58.288
UH-HUH.

11:58.288 --> 12:02.322
MAYBE WE'LL FIND A PARTY,
LET THE PARTY FIND US.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.294
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

12:04.294 --> 12:06.326
THIS? IT'S A SHIRT.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.327
MM.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.999
GOT THESE COOL METAL STUDS.

12:08.999 --> 12:11.331
THE GIRL AT THE STORE
THOUGHT I LOOKED HOT IN IT.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.333
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT
SHE WAS FLIRTING WITH ME, BUT--

12:13.333 --> 12:14.805
BEFORE I FORGET,
THE NEIGHBOR LET HIS DOG

12:14.805 --> 12:16.166
POOP IN THE YARD AGAIN.

12:16.166 --> 12:17.437
I DON'T WANT ANYONE FROM
THE BOOK CLUB STEPPING IN IT,

12:17.437 --> 12:19.309
SO IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND?

12:19.309 --> 12:20.771
SURE.

12:20.771 --> 12:25.045
THANK YOU. MWAH.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.077
(mouths word)

12:27.077 --> 12:28.178
(clicks)

12:37.057 --> 12:39.830
HEY, B. I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU A SECOND.

12:39.830 --> 12:42.132
I'M SORRY, SIR, YOU NEED
TO GET THE NERD VACCINE

12:42.132 --> 12:44.364
BEFOREYOU START
SHOWING SYMPTOMS.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.436
(laughing)

12:46.436 --> 12:49.469
YOU'RE SUCH A SCREAM.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.041
I NEED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.143
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED--

12:53.143 --> 12:54.474
WORST TIME OF MY LIFE.
GO AHEAD.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.506
AND WE WERE H-HAVING SEX--

12:56.506 --> 12:57.848
DARKEST MOMENTS
OF THE WORST TIME OF MY LIFE.

12:57.848 --> 12:59.049
GO AHEAD.

12:59.049 --> 13:00.981
WAS I ANY GOOD?

13:00.981 --> 13:03.283
AT WHAT? DROOLING?
FALLING ASLEEP?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.484
TURNING BRIGHT RED?

13:04.484 --> 13:06.116
I WAS WITH THIS GIRL
LAST NIGHT--

13:06.116 --> 13:07.487
WORST MOMENT OF HER LIFE.
GO AHEAD.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.989
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
I DON'T EVEN--

13:08.989 --> 13:10.120
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.863
OH, HOLD ON.

13:12.863 --> 13:14.995
(sighs)

13:14.995 --> 13:16.526
I'M SORRY.

13:16.526 --> 13:17.567
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS

13:17.567 --> 13:19.830
IN OUR MARRIAGE
YOU WERE TERRIBLE AT,

13:19.830 --> 13:21.401
SO MANY AREAS
WHERE YOU SUCKED

13:21.401 --> 13:23.503
AND WERE DEFICIENT
AND DISAPPOINTING...

13:23.503 --> 13:25.235
IS THERE A "BUT" PART
TO THIS SENTENCE?

13:25.235 --> 13:28.178
BUTTHINGS
IN THE BEDROOM...

13:28.178 --> 13:29.880
(voice breaks)
WERE ALWAYS GREAT.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.311
REALLY?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.582
REALLY.

13:35.846 --> 13:36.947
THANKS, B.

13:39.189 --> 13:42.352
I'M BACK IN THE SADDLE.

13:42.352 --> 13:44.995
NOT SURPRISED
SHE NEEDS A SADDLE!

13:44.995 --> 13:46.857
I'M WEARING
THIS COOL METAL SHIRT.

13:46.857 --> 13:49.359
I TELL HER THAT THE SALESWOMAN
FLIRTED WITH ME,

13:49.359 --> 13:51.231
AND ALL SHE SAYS IS
THAT I SHOULD PICK UP THE POOP

13:51.231 --> 13:52.602
ON MY WAY OUT.

13:52.602 --> 13:53.904
YOU'RE NOT A PEACOCK, WILL.

13:53.904 --> 13:56.836
NO, I AM NOT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.338
YOU GOTTA BE AGGRESSIVE.
YOU HAVE TO DEMAND

13:58.338 --> 14:01.211
THAT SHE ACKNOWLEDGE YOU ARE
A DESIRABLE, VIRILE MAN.

14:01.211 --> 14:03.343
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
(blows air)

14:03.343 --> 14:04.374
(Craig, mouth full)
LISTEN TO HIM, WILL.

14:04.374 --> 14:06.216
HE KNOWS WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

14:06.216 --> 14:07.918
HEY, CAN I TAKE
THESE WHITENING STRIPS OFF

14:07.918 --> 14:09.119
MY TEETH NOW?

14:09.119 --> 14:11.922
NO. DIDN'T YOU NOTICE?
YOUR GIRL HAS PORCELAIN VENEERS.

14:11.922 --> 14:13.583
WHITE TEETH ARE IMPORTANT
TO HER.

14:13.583 --> 14:14.624
YOU CAN'T GO WALKING
IN THERE

14:14.624 --> 14:17.627
WITH THIS MOUTH FULL
OF CANDY CORNS.

14:17.627 --> 14:20.490
HE'S A DETAIL MAN, WILL.
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO HIM.

14:20.490 --> 14:21.591
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:21.591 --> 14:24.394
I GOTTA DEMAND THAT THERESA STOP
TAKING ME FOR GRANTED

14:24.394 --> 14:28.939
AND ACKNOWLEDGE ME
AND THIS RIDICULOUS SHIRT.

14:28.939 --> 14:32.302
I SWEAR, IT FEELS LIKE
THERE'S FISHHOOKS IN THIS THING.

14:32.302 --> 14:35.045
NOW GO IN THERE AND BRING ME
THREE SHIRT CHOICES,

14:35.045 --> 14:36.106
ALL IN BLUE...
(door opens)

14:36.106 --> 14:37.107
BUT NO COBALT, TURQUOISE,

14:37.107 --> 14:38.608
OR INDIGO.
(door closes)

14:38.608 --> 14:39.910
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE--

14:39.910 --> 14:42.212
SHH. (whispers) GO.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.619
MY GOOD SIR, I WILL TAKE

14:49.619 --> 14:51.191
THIS GALLON OF MILK,
A BAG OF RAZZLES.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.593
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PURCHASE
A BOX OF YOUR FINEST CONDOMS,

14:53.593 --> 14:55.926
AND I WILL BE TAKING
A PENNY.

14:55.926 --> 14:57.197
(sighs)

14:57.197 --> 15:00.931
VICKI, I TRUST WILL. HE'S NOT
GOING TO HAVE AN AFFAIR.

15:00.931 --> 15:02.372
BRENDA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:02.372 --> 15:04.574
LOOKING
FOR THIS GIRL'S PICTURE.

15:04.574 --> 15:05.905
WHAT DID YOU SAY
HER NAME WAS AGAIN?
(sighs)

15:05.905 --> 15:06.977
MOLLY HELMOND.
WE TOOK YOGA TOGETHER.

15:06.977 --> 15:09.039
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HER.

15:09.039 --> 15:10.340
NOTHING IS GOING
TO CHANGE MY--

15:10.340 --> 15:13.383
(gasps) YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:13.383 --> 15:14.914
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOOK.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.246
HEY, DID ANYBODY EVEN BRING
A COPY OF IT THIS TIME?

15:16.246 --> 15:18.148
AN--

15:18.148 --> 15:20.490
(whispers) BRENDA.

15:27.697 --> 15:28.698
(doorbell rings)

15:28.698 --> 15:30.930
KENNY?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.362
HI! (chuckles) SHERI.

15:32.362 --> 15:34.234
I PANICKED LAST NIGHT
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HAD SEX

15:34.234 --> 15:36.706
WITH ANYONE
BUT MY EX-WIFE... (laughs)

15:36.706 --> 15:39.709
BUT I REALLY,
REALLYLIKE YOU,

15:39.709 --> 15:42.312
AND... I HOPE I DIDN'T MISS
MY OPPORTUNITY

15:42.312 --> 15:44.474
TO... (inhales deeply)

15:44.474 --> 15:46.977
YOU KNOW...
(chuckles and sniffles)

15:46.977 --> 15:48.248
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M GETTING AT?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.080
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GETTING AT.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.081
YEAH?

15:51.081 --> 15:52.082
UH-HUH.
OH, GOOD.

15:52.082 --> 15:53.283
(laughs)
MMM.

15:53.283 --> 15:56.026
(chuckles)
(elderly woman)
THAT TOM BERGERON

15:56.026 --> 15:58.458
HAS SUCH KIND EYES.
(TV playing indistinctly)

15:58.458 --> 16:00.290
BUT TONIGHT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.164
(chuckles)

16:04.164 --> 16:06.296
SO I GOT A TEACHING JOB,
MOVED HERE FROM CHICAGO,

16:06.296 --> 16:07.497
AND I'VE BEEN STAYING
WITH GRANDMA ROSE

16:07.497 --> 16:09.039
TILL I FIND AN APARTMENT.

16:09.039 --> 16:09.739
WE WATCH
"DANCING WITH THE STARS"

16:09.739 --> 16:12.342
EVERY TUESDAY NIGHT.

16:12.342 --> 16:15.045
SHE SEEMS VERY SWEET.

16:15.045 --> 16:16.676
I FEEL GUILTY FOR
NOT APPRECIATING THE FACT

16:16.676 --> 16:18.508
THAT SHE'S STILL WITH US.

16:25.685 --> 16:26.756
(mutters)

16:26.756 --> 16:29.359
THERESA, WE NEED TO TALK.

16:29.359 --> 16:31.361
YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY ABOUT
WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT.

16:31.361 --> 16:32.992
(whispers) HOW DARE YOU?!

16:32.992 --> 16:35.225
YEAH, LIKE--LIKE THAT,
ONLY... LESS.

16:35.225 --> 16:36.626
I SAW HER PICTURE, WILL.
WHOSE PICTURE?

16:36.626 --> 16:38.298
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
FROM THE BAR. SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.769
YOU DIDN'T MENTION THAT
LAST NIGHT.

16:39.769 --> 16:42.102
OH... (chuckles) SO FIRST
I'M TOO BORING TO WORRY ABOUT,

16:42.102 --> 16:44.074
AND THEN I'M IN TROUBLE
BECAUSE A WOMAN

16:44.074 --> 16:46.476
WHO COULDN'T POSSIBLY FIND ME
ATTRACTIVE IS HOT?

16:46.476 --> 16:49.008
OH. OH!
SO YOU THINK SHE'S HOT?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.110
(chuckles) YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CALLED HER GORGEOUS.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.481
(gasps) I NEVER SAID
SHE WAS GORGEOUS.

16:51.481 --> 16:52.712
YOU THINK SHE'S GORGEOUS?

16:52.712 --> 16:55.545
I-I THINK SHE'S...
W-WAIT A MINUTE.

16:55.545 --> 16:57.087
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

16:57.087 --> 17:00.090
UH, LOOK, I JUST CAME IN HERE
WANTING YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE

17:00.090 --> 17:02.222
THAT YOU THINK I'M...
(sighs)

17:02.222 --> 17:04.494
I THINK YOU'REWHAT?

17:04.494 --> 17:06.356
SEXY, OKAY?

17:06.356 --> 17:09.759
OH, GOD. PLEASE NEVER TELL
MY FATHER I SAID THAT.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.361
HE STILL MAKES FUN OF ME
FOR THAT CHRISTMAS

17:11.361 --> 17:12.802
WHEN I TOLD HIM
I LOVED HIM.

17:12.802 --> 17:16.806
SO YOU DON'T THINK
I FIND YOU SEXY?

17:16.806 --> 17:19.709
YOU LAUGHED AT THE IDEA
OF ME HAVING AN AFFAIR.

17:19.709 --> 17:24.074
BECAUSE YOU ARE
SUCH A GOOD GUY, WILL.

17:24.074 --> 17:26.146
I KNOW YOU NEVER WOULD.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.079
(chuckles) WOW.

17:29.079 --> 17:32.252
SUDDENLY I FEEL REALLY
SELF-CONSCIOUS IN THIS SHIRT.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.054
(snorts and laughs)

17:36.356 --> 17:38.328
YOU'RE THE SEXIEST MAN
I KNOW, WILL.

17:42.492 --> 17:44.834
(women) AW.

17:46.736 --> 17:49.139
I LOVE THIS BOOK CLUB.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.073
AND THEN THE CHIEF SAYS,
"YOU GOT IT BACKWARDS, BUDDY.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.406
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.
THAT'S THE WIENER PRESS."

17:56.406 --> 17:59.109
(all laugh)

17:59.109 --> 18:01.411
OH, FINALLY.

18:01.411 --> 18:05.815
AH. SIR, UM, WE ARE TRAVELING
BY HUMMOUSINE--HUMMER/LIMO--

18:05.815 --> 18:08.588
SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ANOTHER BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.660
(mouths words)

18:10.660 --> 18:11.861
(lowered voice) REMEMBER,
YOUR LADY KNOWS MONEY,

18:11.861 --> 18:12.822
SO DON'T HOLD BACK.

18:12.822 --> 18:13.823
(whispers) RIGHT.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.125
(normal voice)
SIR, BRING US A BOTTLE

18:15.125 --> 18:17.096
OF YOUR MOST EXPENSIVE
CHAMPAGNE,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.198
AND I TELL YOU WHAT.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.370
CRACK ONE OPEN FOR YOU
AND YOUR BUDDIES IN THE KITCHEN.

18:20.370 --> 18:21.471
OKAY.

18:21.471 --> 18:23.102
(lowered voice)
DON'T DO THAT.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.205
YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.377
WELL, THIS IS
A SPECIAL NIGHT.

18:27.377 --> 18:28.378
(chuckles)
THAT'S SO SWEET.

18:28.378 --> 18:30.340
THEY'RE GETTING ALONG
AWFULLY WELL.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.142
GRANT IS VERY GOOD
AT WHAT HE DOES.

18:32.142 --> 18:34.784
WELL, WE HOOKED 'EM UP,
SO, UH, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

18:34.784 --> 18:35.785
(chuckles)
(chuckles) YES.

18:35.785 --> 18:38.148
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

18:38.148 --> 18:40.390
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

18:40.390 --> 18:43.193
OUR WORK'S DONE.
I'M GONNA GRAB A CAB.

18:43.193 --> 18:44.454
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LIMO?

18:44.454 --> 18:47.197
WELL, THEY'RE GONNA WANT
TO BE ALONE IN THE LIMO.

18:47.197 --> 18:49.559
NO,WE'REGONNA WANT TO BE
ALONE IN THE LIMO.

18:49.559 --> 18:52.702
OH, NO. I-I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE IN THE LIMO.

18:52.702 --> 18:55.635
BUT YOU AND I ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE...

18:55.635 --> 18:56.866
I MEAN,
'CAUSE THEY'RE JUST...

18:56.866 --> 18:59.869
(both chuckling)

18:59.869 --> 19:02.672
CAN I ASK A QUESTION
TO THE TABLE?

19:02.672 --> 19:06.216
UM, WHO HERE IS WINGMANNING
FOR THEIR BUDDY?

19:12.852 --> 19:16.456
AND WHO HERE IS INTERESTED
IN A ROMANTIC CONNECTION...

19:16.456 --> 19:17.587
WITH ME?

19:21.361 --> 19:23.793
(sighs)

19:23.793 --> 19:25.695
WHEW. ALL RIGHT. UH, I THINK--

19:25.695 --> 19:28.198
NO, DON'T OPEN THAT! (sighs)
(pops)

19:29.299 --> 19:31.341
YOU'RE A DETAIL MAN, HUH?

19:31.341 --> 19:33.603
WELL, YOU MISSED
ONE PRETTY IMPORTANT DETAIL.

19:33.603 --> 19:35.174
YEAH, I DID MISS THAT.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.248
OH,PERFECT!

19:38.248 --> 19:40.480
YOU'RE
THE WORST WINGMAN EVER.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.881
CRAIG, THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE HURTFUL.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.353
(scoffs)
YOU SLAPPED MY FACE,

19:43.353 --> 19:44.614
SAID MY TEETH LOOKED LIKE
CANDY CORN,

19:44.614 --> 19:46.686
GOT ME TO SPEND $300
ON A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE,

19:46.686 --> 19:47.857
AND I'M HURTING
YOURFEELINGS?!

19:47.857 --> 19:48.858
YES, YOU ARE.

19:48.858 --> 19:50.520
I'M SORRY.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.323
LOVEBIRDS, YOUR CHAMPAGNE
IS CORKED AND WAITING.

19:53.323 --> 19:56.926
THIS IS A BAD NIGHT
FOR YOU, CRAIG.

19:58.568 --> 19:59.899
(sighs)

20:01.401 --> 20:04.804
(Grant) MAN, THERE ARE A LOT
OF ROSE PETALS IN HERE.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.776
SO SHERI LET ME IN,
BUT HER GRANDMA WAS THERE

20:06.776 --> 20:08.478
WATCHING
"DANCING WITH THE STARS."

20:08.478 --> 20:09.939
OH, SO IT DIDN'T WORK OUT?

20:09.939 --> 20:11.881
WELL, NO ONE CAN BLAME YOU
FOR BACKING OUT OF THAT.

20:11.881 --> 20:14.344
GENTLEMEN, I THINK YOU
UNDERESTIMATE MY HORNINESS.

20:14.344 --> 20:16.616
(TV playing indistinctly)
OH, I REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME

20:16.616 --> 20:21.451
YOUR GRANDFATHER ASKED ME
TO DANCE. IT WAS 1950--

20:21.451 --> 20:23.623
WHOA. SO YOU DID IT
WITH GRANDMA IN THE ROOM?

20:23.623 --> 20:24.894
SHE NEVER NOTICED.
(chuckles)

20:24.894 --> 20:26.626
OH, GOD.
And, oh, by the way,

20:26.626 --> 20:29.959
TWO LADIES IN THE SAME ROOM--
TECHNICAL THREESOME.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.402
SURE. I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

20:32.402 --> 20:33.533
(chuckles)

20:33.533 --> 20:35.234
YEAH, I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.970
(harp playing glissando)

20:45.415 --> 20:46.746
ARE YOU AN ANGEL?

20:46.746 --> 20:47.947
♪♪♪

20:47.947 --> 20:49.719
AM I DEAD?

20:49.719 --> 20:53.022
(voice breaks) OH, MY GOD!
I HAD SO MUCH MORE TO DO.

20:53.022 --> 20:54.023
(normal voice) NOT REALLY.

20:54.023 --> 20:56.255
MORNING, KENNY.
THIS IS LANA.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.758
I HIRED HER BECAUSE I WAS HOPING
MY DATE FROM LAST NIGHT

20:58.758 --> 21:00.960
WAS GOING TO STAY OVER,
AND WE'D HAVE A SEXY BREAKFAST.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.434
MR. CRAIG, DOES YOUR LOVER LIKE
BLUEBERRIES ON HIS PANCAKES?

21:04.434 --> 21:05.665
UH, YES, HE DOES,

21:05.665 --> 21:06.666
AND HE ALSO LIKES
HIS BACON BURNT TO A CRISP.

21:06.666 --> 21:07.867
(doorbell rings)
THAT'S MUST BE

21:07.867 --> 21:10.670
THE $200 NONREFUNDABLE
COUPLES MASSAGE I BOOKED.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.701
OHH.

21:11.701 --> 21:12.702
IT'S NOW MY GIFT TO YOU
AND LANA.

21:12.702 --> 21:13.843
I'M GOING BACK TO BED.

21:13.843 --> 21:15.505
LANA, PLEASE DON'T THINK
I'M RUDE,

21:15.505 --> 21:17.877
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE
THE COUPLES MASSAGE BY MYSELF.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.849
I'M GONNA DISROBE,
REMAIN STANDING.

21:19.849 --> 21:21.981
ONE DOES MY FRONT.
ONE DOES MY BACK.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.053
NOW JUST PLAY
SOMETHING UPBEAT

21:24.053 --> 21:27.317
SO WE CAN PROCEED
WITH KENNY'S BEST DAY EVER.
