00:38.308 --> 00:40.872
What... What's...
What's going on?

00:41.123 --> 00:43.959
Roger, we have to talk.
This family has a problem.

00:44.489 --> 00:46.562
Finally! We can get this
all out in the open.

00:46.687 --> 00:50.215
I'll start. Klaus, you're useless
and everyone hates you.

00:51.177 --> 00:53.252
No, Roger. This is about you.

00:53.377 --> 00:54.474
The last 2 months,

00:54.599 --> 00:56.968
your selfish behaviour
has gotten out of control.

00:57.093 --> 00:58.264
Stan, tell him.

00:58.434 --> 01:02.102
For starters, you constantly raid
the fridge and drink all my Five Alive.

01:02.272 --> 01:05.674
You take our clothes without asking
and then disappear all day

01:05.799 --> 01:08.525
so you can run around
as one of your ridiculous personas.

01:08.695 --> 01:11.392
I regret my dance card
is filled for the evening,

01:11.517 --> 01:13.614
but there's always
the Spring Cotillion.

01:14.198 --> 01:15.499
I'll tell you what I think.

01:15.624 --> 01:17.591
I think you hide
behind all these disguises

01:17.716 --> 01:19.872
so you don't have to face {\the fact}
that the real you

01:19.997 --> 01:21.496
is an inconsiderate jerk.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.610
It doesn't matter
how you treat people

01:23.735 --> 01:26.383
when you could blame it
on Professor Edelstein

01:26.508 --> 01:29.117
or ATNT operator Shalanda Dykes.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.459
Speaking of which,

01:30.584 --> 01:32.483
that credit for my Friends
and Family Plan

01:32.608 --> 01:34.009
still hasn't shown up on my bill.

01:34.217 --> 01:36.940
That credit was generated
after your last statement,

01:37.065 --> 01:38.916
it'll show up on your next bill.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.390
Okay, thank you.

01:40.689 --> 01:43.633
- Thank you for chosing ATNT.
- Enough!

01:43.758 --> 01:45.901
You have been treating us
like doormats, for months

01:46.026 --> 01:47.885
and we're sick and tired of it.

01:48.224 --> 01:49.378
I hear you.

01:50.064 --> 01:51.518
I hear you loud and clear.

01:52.072 --> 01:54.946
And I guess all I can say is,
"Eat my dust!"

01:55.328 --> 01:57.115
- He's getting away!
- Stop him!

01:59.755 --> 02:01.708
For God's sake. Roger, get up!

02:03.482 --> 02:04.525
My tequila!

02:04.650 --> 02:06.220
That worm had a name!

02:07.277 --> 02:08.454
If you will excuse me,

02:08.579 --> 02:10.838
I am late for
my daughter's arranged wedding.

02:11.026 --> 02:12.790
She will learn to love him.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.586
That was a waste of time.

02:16.711 --> 02:18.011
Hey, what's this?

02:18.996 --> 02:21.394
An old game I found under the couch
when we moved it.

02:21.519 --> 02:22.519
Simon?

02:22.703 --> 02:24.469
- Is that Simon?
- What's Simon?

02:24.594 --> 02:26.219
Only the best game ever!

02:26.344 --> 02:28.280
It's totally addictive. Watch.

02:39.037 --> 02:41.235
Wait, you haven't seen
the yellow light yet.

02:42.262 --> 02:43.640
There's a yellow light.

02:47.530 --> 02:50.498
A case of whiskey and a Modern Bride,
my good man.

02:50.623 --> 02:51.573
I'm a woman.

02:51.698 --> 02:53.992
I don't want to fight,
just run the card, dude.

02:58.721 --> 03:01.184
- It says it's declined.
- Impossible!

03:01.309 --> 03:04.023
Your manish fingers
just hit the wrong buttons.

03:05.700 --> 03:07.583
- Declined.
- That's strange.

03:08.033 --> 03:10.980
Well, I guess I'll just go
put these things... in my house!

03:14.862 --> 03:17.546
Your card was declined
because you exceeded your credit limit.

03:17.671 --> 03:18.906
That's impossible!

03:19.031 --> 03:22.918
You did just make a big purchase.
I see a diamond ring for $5,000.

03:23.043 --> 03:23.866
What?

03:23.991 --> 03:26.664
 That's right.It was purchased
by a co-signer on your account.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.092
Sidney Huffman.

03:28.331 --> 03:30.808
Co-signer?
I never authorized a co-signer.

03:30.933 --> 03:31.626
Sir!

03:32.252 --> 03:35.418
I can't have you lying on the floor
and making phone calls.

03:38.499 --> 03:40.513
Roger, I'm afraid you may be right.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.482
I think the family hates me.

03:42.607 --> 03:44.750
Hate is a strong word.
And accurate.

03:44.875 --> 03:48.101
But you can still salvage my love
by finding my other glove.

03:48.226 --> 03:49.278
I can never find it

03:49.403 --> 03:52.564
and what I'm about to embark on
requires leaving no fingerprints.

03:52.734 --> 03:55.744
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna get even with that scumbag

03:55.869 --> 03:58.029
who added his name
on my credit card.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.779
Time to dish out
a little street justice.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.739
Death Wish style.

04:04.225 --> 04:05.754
Death Wish was a movie.

04:06.565 --> 04:08.116
Starring Charles Bronson.

04:09.227 --> 04:12.143
He had a mustache. Anyway,I've found out
where this Sidney guy works,

04:12.268 --> 04:14.361
where he lives,
even his phone number.

04:16.144 --> 04:18.466
Voice mail.
Sidney, this is Roger Smith.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.345
You screwed with the wrong guy.

04:20.470 --> 04:22.760
Prepare to have your life destroyed!

04:23.670 --> 04:25.147
Now, did you find my glove?

04:27.006 --> 04:29.559
It's like you want to be
kicked out of this family.

04:32.357 --> 04:35.200
Of course, you work
at a Bible company, Sidney.

04:35.469 --> 04:37.127
Perfect cover for a thief.

04:39.882 --> 04:40.657
There.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.833
Let's see what
your Bible-thumping customers

04:42.958 --> 04:44.537
think of these changes!

04:48.819 --> 04:51.633
How lucky!
Sidney's address book.

04:53.151 --> 04:54.431
And who's this?

04:54.732 --> 04:57.783
Judy Pennewitz,
the "i" doted with a heart.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.265
Betcha she's the broad
you bought the ring for.

05:00.552 --> 05:02.484
Guess I'll have to pay her a visit.

05:02.876 --> 05:04.874
She works at a department store.

05:05.089 --> 05:07.737
Please, God.
Let their mannequins have nipples.

05:08.093 --> 05:09.274
But not heads.

05:12.063 --> 05:13.372
Honey, I'm home!

05:14.656 --> 05:16.206
You're playing Simon!

05:16.490 --> 05:18.002
Stan, you made me mess up!

05:18.127 --> 05:20.279
See, I told you guys
it was addictive.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.931
This is a good seat
to watch from too,

05:25.225 --> 05:26.664
as part of the family.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.117
Be loved.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.250
Stan, you missed a belt loop
back here.

05:31.375 --> 05:32.995
But I'm sure you're fine.

05:33.319 --> 05:36.418
Your pants didn't fall down today,
did they?

05:49.749 --> 05:53.230
Three days and nearly every piece
of Sidney's life is in shambles.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.219
I have a voice mail.

05:55.510 --> 05:57.122
And that's from Sidney.

05:57.435 --> 05:59.438
Stop ruining my life, please!

05:59.563 --> 06:00.829
Just leave me alone!

06:00.954 --> 06:03.248
Don't worry, Sidney.
You will be alone.

06:03.373 --> 06:05.849
Once I have a little chat
with your girlfriend.

06:09.084 --> 06:10.138
May I help you?

06:10.263 --> 06:12.246
I'm looking for a Judy Pennewitz.

06:12.371 --> 06:15.373
What a coincidence!
I'm a Judy Pennewitz!

06:18.109 --> 06:20.697
- Do you know a Sidney Huffman?
- I sure do.

06:20.822 --> 06:22.167
He's my boyfriend.

06:22.292 --> 06:25.247
Only I hope soon
he's gonna be more than just that.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.643
I have a little news about him.

06:30.866 --> 06:32.107
And tomorrow, Sidney,

06:32.232 --> 06:35.461
I'll destroy the last most
irreplaceable thing in your life!

06:35.783 --> 06:37.228
Your possessions!

06:43.184 --> 06:44.113
Good news!

06:44.238 --> 06:48.039
I found some game
that are for more than 4 players!

06:49.990 --> 06:51.350
Guys? Hello?

06:51.791 --> 06:54.454
Wait. Have you not moved
since I left?

06:57.460 --> 06:58.892
Mein Gott...

06:59.267 --> 07:02.282
Like countless children
and stoners before you,

07:02.407 --> 07:06.034
you have been enslaved
by the four-tone succubus!

07:06.635 --> 07:09.987
Damn you, Hasbro!

07:15.890 --> 07:18.027
Using the credit card
that started it all

07:18.152 --> 07:19.739
to help me end it all.

07:23.344 --> 07:26.308
Torching this dump almost feels
like I'm doing him a favor.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.277
"How do you do?
A young man's guide to manners."

07:32.622 --> 07:35.009
This guy is a douche
with a capital bag.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.418
Just like my missing glove.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.237
Now, somebody has a pair.

07:42.564 --> 07:44.180
And somebody has nothing.

07:46.106 --> 07:48.299
Look, this must be a photo
of the sap.

07:49.774 --> 07:50.944
My God!

07:53.593 --> 07:54.908
I'm the sap.

07:55.395 --> 07:56.660
I'm Sidney.

07:56.929 --> 07:59.971
One of my personas
has taken on a life of its own!

08:01.107 --> 08:03.815
 4 DAYS EARLIER

08:29.519 --> 08:33.025
Peaches and cream. Why do I always
wake up feeling hung over?

08:33.150 --> 08:35.227
I don't even touch
the devil's nectar.

08:37.809 --> 08:41.184
Your toothy mug is the only cure
for my morning maladies.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.690
When I pop the big Q this Saturday,
you better say yes or...

08:44.890 --> 08:46.757
I'll kiss until you do!

08:49.989 --> 08:52.653
Lonesome glove,
what can I never find your mate?

08:52.876 --> 08:56.216
Did I donate it to that soldier
I read about who lost his arm in Iraq?

08:56.538 --> 08:59.763
I would've remember getting
a sloppily written thank you note.

09:00.177 --> 09:03.446
Boys and berry pancakes!
Somebody left me a message last night.

09:03.892 --> 09:05.547
Sidney, this is Roger Smith.

09:05.672 --> 09:07.281
You screwed with the wrong guy.

09:07.406 --> 09:09.579
Prepare to have your life destroyed.

09:10.093 --> 09:12.169
That gentleman has the wrong Sidney.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.737
Or he's dyslexic
and angry at Disney.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.981
Your garden is looking great,
Sidney!

09:22.106 --> 09:24.645
There's you
and there's Johnny Appleseed.

09:24.815 --> 09:28.003
No, sir, Mr. Stashwick.
There'll never be another Johnny.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.193
Have a stupendous day!

09:33.753 --> 09:35.907
Oh, boy! The gang's all here today.

09:36.287 --> 09:38.868
Hello, Linux!
Hildegarde, slow down and chew.

09:39.207 --> 09:40.545
Share, Jerediah.

09:41.244 --> 09:43.154
And you, I don't know, but welcome.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.651
- Huffman!
- Good day to you, Mr. McCreary.

09:50.776 --> 09:52.507
In my office! Now!

09:53.928 --> 09:56.427
You're familiar with the first line
of Genesis?

09:56.597 --> 09:59.180
I should say I am, sir.
I should say I am.

09:59.350 --> 10:00.649
Does this sound right?

10:00.774 --> 10:02.983
"In the beginning,
God created the heavens

10:03.108 --> 10:06.367
"and the transvestite who pooped
mozzarella dinosaurs."

10:07.094 --> 10:09.287
- Blasphemy!
- Cut the act, Huffman.

10:09.412 --> 10:12.276
 I know You came in last night
and edited the Bible from your computer.

10:12.616 --> 10:14.946
I would never temper
with the word of the Lord.

10:15.116 --> 10:18.067
A thousand copies ruined.
You're fired.

10:20.196 --> 10:23.409
Rudy, Tootie, fresh and fruity!
I'm in a pile of doody!

10:26.419 --> 10:28.599
Time to buck up and find a new job.

10:28.841 --> 10:31.943
These have been a trying few days
but the worst is surely over.

10:36.353 --> 10:37.477
My garden!

10:37.602 --> 10:41.269
Sidney! It happened last night
but you weren't around.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.570
I bet it's the man who left me
that malevolent message.

10:44.837 --> 10:47.119
I think he's trying
to sabotage my life.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.010
I didn't get a good look him,

10:49.135 --> 10:51.440
though I did see
what he did to your new tree.

10:51.762 --> 10:53.847
My little sycamore! What did he do?

10:55.253 --> 10:56.480
He raped it.

10:57.267 --> 10:58.756
I mean he just...

10:59.865 --> 11:01.909
Yeah, the guy raped the tree.

11:06.709 --> 11:10.364
My flowery friends may be gone
but I've still my feathery ones.

11:11.031 --> 11:13.569
Rasberry Mary Mother of James!

11:25.730 --> 11:28.619
Stop this! Please stop doing this,
you're killing me!

11:29.438 --> 11:32.357
I punked you!
It's not really me it's my voice mail.

11:32.482 --> 11:36.462
You're not supposed to wear stupid
after Labor Day.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.405
Stop ruining my life!

11:38.530 --> 11:40.406
Please, just leave me alone!

11:43.216 --> 11:45.385
Oh, the Lord is good to me

11:45.724 --> 11:47.721
And so I thank the Lord

11:47.846 --> 11:50.051
For giving me the things I need

11:50.176 --> 11:52.802
The sun and rain and the apple Seed

11:58.986 --> 12:02.040
Petunia, the last few days
have been the worst of my life.

12:02.224 --> 12:04.099
But if you say "Yes"
to my next question,

12:04.224 --> 12:06.541
I'll know that
all the dark clouds in the world

12:06.666 --> 12:08.868
couldn't rain
on Sidney Huffman's parade.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.055
Would you do me the modest favor

12:12.180 --> 12:14.190
of making me
the happiest man on earth?

12:14.552 --> 12:15.553
Marry you?

12:15.780 --> 12:19.195
I never want to see you again,
"less" alone marry you!

12:19.365 --> 12:21.822
The man from the clinic
stopped by the store yesterday.

12:21.947 --> 12:24.867
And told me all about your diseases
and your dalliances.

12:25.561 --> 12:26.644
That's not true.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.464
That guy is putting
the screws to me.

12:28.589 --> 12:30.792
I don't want to ear about
your pre-vergence.

12:31.156 --> 12:34.219
And here are your test results.
I couldn't even look at them.

12:34.344 --> 12:36.480
I didn't want to get my eyes dirty.

12:40.055 --> 12:42.058
Dear Sidney,
I just wanted to let you know

12:42.183 --> 12:45.745
that I'm gonna make you pay for stealing
from me until the day you die.

12:46.210 --> 12:47.533
Sincerely, Roger Smith.

12:47.973 --> 12:50.380
PS: Your sycamore had saplings.

12:51.017 --> 12:52.566
I made them watch.

12:53.191 --> 12:55.563
Oh, that's it,
he's never gonna stop.

12:56.135 --> 12:58.375
There's only one way out of this.

13:03.394 --> 13:05.515
Look, this must be
a photo of the sap.

13:06.790 --> 13:07.898
My God!

13:10.138 --> 13:11.449
I'm the sap.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.218
I'm Sidney.

13:13.516 --> 13:16.268
One of my person has taken on
a life of its own.

13:17.806 --> 13:19.422
Sidney Huffman hired me to kill you.

13:28.159 --> 13:30.494
My God, I took a hit out on myself.

13:30.804 --> 13:32.628
And I probably charged it to me.

13:33.498 --> 13:34.403
Still miles.

13:40.896 --> 13:42.267
Oh, my God! I'm gonna die.

13:42.660 --> 13:45.096
And I still have two years left
on my Apple Care.

13:47.682 --> 13:49.535
They're still playing
at that dumbass game.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.262
Not for long.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.084
Son of a bitch! It can work.

13:57.515 --> 13:59.143
The spell is broken.

13:59.268 --> 14:01.979
I wreak of wee cold urine
and I'm ashamed of that!

14:02.104 --> 14:03.540
Klaus saved us all.

14:03.665 --> 14:06.233
Come on, let's go to the fridge
to check on the baloney situation.

14:18.507 --> 14:20.080
I was gone 60 years.

14:20.330 --> 14:21.892
- How long was it here?
- What?

14:22.464 --> 14:24.227
- Where did you go?
- I don't know.

14:24.463 --> 14:25.619
But wherever it was,

14:26.286 --> 14:27.669
I am their king now.

14:28.341 --> 14:29.486
Klaus, I'm in trouble.

14:29.611 --> 14:31.631
I spent all week taking revenge
on a guy

14:31.756 --> 14:34.283
and that guy turned out to be
an alter ego of mine

14:34.408 --> 14:37.503
- and now he's taking a hit out on me.
- Calm down, calm down.

14:37.628 --> 14:40.075
Don't tell me to calm down,
this hitman is a pro!

14:40.464 --> 14:42.424
Look,
I found this in Sidney's address book.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.631
 HITMAN, I'LL KILL HIMM FOR YOU

14:43.801 --> 14:44.714
Look at this.

14:44.839 --> 14:48.946
Premium 80-pound matte card stock,
the letters are raised. I'm a dead man!

14:49.389 --> 14:51.350
This is perfect.
Just phone the guy,

14:51.475 --> 14:54.799
pretend you're your alter ego
and call off the hit.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.456
That's genius.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.229
I think I can sound like him.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.520
- Hello, this is Sidney Huffman.
- Hey, Sidney, what do you want?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.429
Make it quick,
I got my girls this weekend.

15:09.554 --> 15:12.485
Listen, I want to call off
the hit on Roger Smith.

15:12.741 --> 15:14.380
No problem,
I just need the password.

15:14.505 --> 15:15.876
Password?

15:16.001 --> 15:18.889
Come on, the password you chose
in case you'd want to call off the hit.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.892
I believe my password is...

15:22.184 --> 15:24.210
- Password.
- No, it's not.

15:25.086 --> 15:27.191
I got little Miss Fussy here

15:27.316 --> 15:29.657
so call me back with the password
or Roger Smith is dead.

15:34.292 --> 15:36.074
Remember me?
The guy who ruined your life.

15:36.199 --> 15:38.185
I need to know
some of Sidney's favorite words.

15:38.469 --> 15:39.553
Favorite words?

15:39.827 --> 15:42.898
You mean like herpes?
Syphilis? Gonorrhoea?

15:43.068 --> 15:46.610
Look, I am Sidney, OK?
If you don't help me, I'm dead.

15:46.879 --> 15:47.916
You're Sidney?

15:48.166 --> 15:50.352
What do you think I am? Stupid?

15:50.477 --> 15:53.699
You're the dumbest person I've ever met.
And I'm Sidney!

15:53.932 --> 15:55.993
Well, Sidney
would never talk to me like that.

16:00.740 --> 16:01.724
Is that you?

16:01.849 --> 16:03.707
But I don't understand.

16:05.513 --> 16:07.491
- Where did you go?
- It's a disguise.

16:08.474 --> 16:09.613
I get it.

16:09.738 --> 16:13.623
You know, Sid, I guess we all wear masks
in some way or another.

16:13.748 --> 16:16.435
We all wear metaphorical mask
to hide our true selves in them.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.059
In personal modern society...
But what I need to know is

16:28.636 --> 16:30.279
Roger, I know you're in there.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.448
Come out or your girlfriend gets it.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.900
You're just gonna abandoned her,
you monster?

16:38.473 --> 16:41.214
Good. You can tell me the password
so I can call off the hit.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.327
Fat chance, mister.
Not after you ruined my life.

16:44.452 --> 16:45.780
I didn't ruin anything.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.776
You're just one of my persona
has gone a AWOL.

16:47.901 --> 16:49.466
What? That's crazy.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.527
It's true.

16:50.789 --> 16:52.446
You're just an extension of me.

16:52.802 --> 16:54.470
Why else do you think
you had my glove?

16:54.739 --> 16:56.014
Those are my gloves.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.057
The ones I bought when I met Judy.

16:58.605 --> 16:59.904
Wait, that's it.

17:00.238 --> 17:02.621
Now I remember how all this began.

17:03.187 --> 17:06.176
It was 2 months ago and I was coming
home from a night of drinking

17:06.301 --> 17:07.834
and shooting dice with Armenians.

17:08.101 --> 17:09.569
That's when I saw them.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.732
The perfect pair of gloves.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.069
But they cost $10.

17:14.308 --> 17:17.037
Ten times
my monthly budget for hand clothes.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.181
Alas, the case was locked

17:19.431 --> 17:21.218
and the key was with the shop girl.

17:21.545 --> 17:22.893
Damn it, Judy, you're late!

17:23.018 --> 17:24.645
Sorry, Mr. Bill Tucker,

17:24.770 --> 17:27.660
my boyfriend Rico got drunk
and buried me alive.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.221
And if that wasn't bad enough,

17:29.346 --> 17:30.770
then he broke up with me.

17:30.895 --> 17:33.258
That's what you get for letting
jerks treat you like garbage.

17:35.531 --> 17:36.372
I know.

17:36.497 --> 17:38.153
All I want in this life is

17:38.278 --> 17:41.642
a good-hearted employed sober fella
who treats me nice.

17:42.435 --> 17:44.675
That's when I came up
with a brilliant scheme.

17:46.314 --> 17:47.481
May I help you, sir?

17:48.098 --> 17:50.898
I found my hands
get chilly when I'm...

17:51.244 --> 17:55.742
out selling bibles or tending
to underprivileged pigeons in the park.

17:56.359 --> 17:59.011
Some have suggested the warmth
of an Irish coffee but

17:59.136 --> 18:02.376
as I don't partake of devil's nectar,
I've decided upon gloves.

18:02.859 --> 18:06.500
Well, aren't you a good-hearted
employed sober fella?

18:06.793 --> 18:09.462
- Dentine Ice
- Who treats me nice.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.673
- I'm Judy.
- I'm Sidney Huffman.

18:13.302 --> 18:15.050
I knew if I could win her confident,

18:15.220 --> 18:16.661
I'd be able to get that key.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.796
Then it will be "Hello, gloves"

18:19.052 --> 18:20.768
and "Goobye, not gloves".

18:21.351 --> 18:25.028
So everyday for the next few weeks,
I visited Judy as Sidney.

18:26.303 --> 18:28.397
But I couldn't get close
to that key.

18:29.253 --> 18:31.696
And suddenly,
I had another brilliant scam.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.621
That'll be $700.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.759
The store clerks knew me
as Sidney Huffman.

18:36.009 --> 18:38.798
So I had a credit card
on my account issued in that name.

18:39.030 --> 18:42.557
Wait, you spent $700
just to steal $10 gloves?

18:43.243 --> 18:44.126
Shut up!

18:45.951 --> 18:47.166
Try it on, my begonia.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.168
This mirror is for customers.

18:54.293 --> 18:56.973
You have to go to the break room
and use the employee's mirror.

18:57.357 --> 18:59.442
You're right.
I'll be right back.

19:05.243 --> 19:06.315
Judy, you idiot!

19:06.637 --> 19:09.211
You left the case open
and a pair of gloves are gone!

19:09.509 --> 19:10.498
You're fired!

19:13.000 --> 19:14.668
I tried to leave but couldn't.

19:15.067 --> 19:17.248
I actually liked that dumb girl.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.507
And caring about someone
more than myself

19:19.632 --> 19:21.853
was a trauma too great
for my psyche to bear.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.263
Something in me split

19:24.388 --> 19:26.675
and a part of me that cared about Judy
was born.

19:29.862 --> 19:32.646
Excuse me. I was just looking
at these gloves in the light.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.778
And thanks to your wonderful sales girl,
I'll take them.

19:36.866 --> 19:39.368
From that moment on,
you had a life of your own.

19:39.937 --> 19:41.553
Like what Katie Holmes used to have.

19:41.891 --> 19:43.250
That explain everything.

19:43.589 --> 19:45.884
But I don't care if you created me,
I want to live!

19:46.009 --> 19:48.487
That's the beauty of it.
Both of us can live,

19:48.791 --> 19:52.258
together as one person
who is the best of both of us.

19:52.551 --> 19:54.066
You just need to call off the hit.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.377
The password is:

19:57.763 --> 20:00.599
- Password 1.
- Hey, that's it.

20:00.822 --> 20:02.888
I require letters and numbers.

20:03.204 --> 20:04.932
All right, girl, yogurt time.

20:05.057 --> 20:06.975
He's gone, Sidney. Come on out.

20:07.476 --> 20:08.560
Let's go to her.

20:09.359 --> 20:10.193
Together.

20:15.159 --> 20:16.624
Oh, cheese and crackers!

20:17.995 --> 20:19.985
Sorry, Syd. You're a good egg.

20:20.402 --> 20:21.737
And that cramps my style.

20:25.299 --> 20:26.528
- I was so...
- Beat it!

20:26.653 --> 20:29.834
Sidney is gone and this guy
only looks out for numero uno.

20:29.959 --> 20:31.812
All you care about is pizza?

20:36.196 --> 20:37.240
Figures!  cf urbandictionary

20:37.365 --> 20:39.445
I finally find the perfect fella,

20:39.570 --> 20:42.774
and he's a figment
of someone's imagination.

20:48.970 --> 20:49.828
Want to...

20:50.257 --> 20:51.186
go get dinner?

20:57.878 --> 20:59.428
You should know I'm a drunk.

21:00.053 --> 21:02.162
Just like my father.

21:05.116 --> 21:06.431
And I have no genitals.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.617
That's OK, I have both.
