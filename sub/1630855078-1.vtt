10:13.905 --> 10:15.535
and your Roxane.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.067
-Thanks for calling.
-[John] Thank you.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.078
["If I Can’t Have You" playing]

10:22.580 --> 10:23.620
That was weird?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.166
-What?
-That caller.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.171
[scoffs] I’ve heard worse.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.383
Hmm.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.510
[tense music]

11:24.392 --> 11:25.602
[sighs]

11:48.082 --> 11:51.042
[indistinct TV chatter]

12:01.012 --> 12:02.222
Hey.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.765
Hey. Sorry,

12:03.848 --> 12:05.268
I didn’t mean to wake you.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.390
No. That’s okay.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.400
I have to be up soon anyway.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.480
Not for a couple hours.

12:13.900 --> 12:14.900
How was work?

12:14.984 --> 12:16.534
You know, when I got home,

12:16.611 --> 12:18.571
Mr. Sklar was awake.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.821
-What?
-Mr. Sklar,

12:21.950 --> 12:23.200
our new next door neighbor.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.624
No. I know who he is,

12:24.744 --> 12:26.794
I just don’t know
what you’re talking about.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.331
Just now, when I came in,
I could see him

12:29.457 --> 12:30.457
behind his blinds.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.583
So what?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.088
So, it’s too early.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.209
You don’t think
that’s kinda strange?

12:35.296 --> 12:37.666
-We’re up.
-We have a reason to be up.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.219
Maybe he does too.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.510
What? No.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.185
I don’t think he even works.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.513
I’ve hardly ever seen him
leave the house.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.679
I don’t know, Michelle.
Maybe he can’t sleep.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.439
Maybe he has an appointment.
Who cares?

12:49.519 --> 12:53.109
I don’t know.
It was just, just weird.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.519
He’s weird.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.689
But it’s none of our business

12:56.818 --> 12:58.648
and it’s not really a big deal.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.032
Go back to sleep.
I’ll be in there soon, okay?

13:02.156 --> 13:03.196
Uh-hmm.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.047
[tense music]

13:52.999 --> 13:55.129
[alarm beeping]

13:57.378 --> 13:58.918
[exhales deeply]

14:14.103 --> 14:15.773
[knock on door]

14:39.379 --> 14:40.549
Your boyfriend?

14:40.630 --> 14:43.170
[gasps] Oh!

14:43.257 --> 14:46.337
Mr. Sklar, I, um...
you scared me.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.757
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it’s from Aiden.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.466
He likes to surprise
me every now and then.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.479
I have a surprise for you.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.982
Your cholesterol
is under control.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.481
The test results.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.362
It’s open.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.533
Of course,

15:03.611 --> 15:05.401
how would I know the results?

15:05.488 --> 15:06.988
It came to my mailbox,

15:07.115 --> 15:09.285
of course I opened it
before I realized

15:09.409 --> 15:11.539
and when I saw, I thought

15:11.619 --> 15:14.039
I never went to a gynecologist.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.122
[chuckles]

15:16.207 --> 15:18.497
Okay. Uh, well, thank you.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.246
I got to get going.
My coffee’s brewing, so...

15:21.337 --> 15:24.917
French vanilla,
one cream, two sugars?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.175
The other day, I was standing
behind you in line.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.472
You didn’t see me.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.140
Okay.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.315
Uh, I gotta go.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.564
So...

15:37.311 --> 15:38.691
[Mr. Sklar chuckles]

15:57.582 --> 15:58.422
Hey.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.169
Hey. I just woke up.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.253
Are you at work?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.915
Um, at work. Not really working.

16:04.005 --> 16:07.055
[chuckles] Well, I just
wanted to thank you.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.265
Okay.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.682
[Michelle] That was very sweet.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.642
-What was?
-The rose.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.971
What rose?

16:14.140 --> 16:16.640
-You didn’t bring me a rose?
-When would I have time?

16:16.726 --> 16:19.766
I went back to bed for an hour,
I took a shower

16:19.854 --> 16:21.564
and then I went to work.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.523
Aiden, I have to go.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.649
Wait, wait, wait.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.784
Who brought you a rose?

16:26.861 --> 16:28.571
I really have to go.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.712
-[Lily] Michelle?
-[Michelle] Uh-hmm.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.344
I think it’s that caller again.
That weird one from yesterday.

16:44.420 --> 16:47.340
-John Doe?
-You want me to put him through?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.052
The phone number. What is it?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.354
It’s blocked.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.467
-Put him through.
-Okay.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.437
[Michelle] That was
"Lovin’ For the Moment"

17:01.562 --> 17:02.982
by The Submarines.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.734
Now let’s get to those phones.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.475
See what our dedicated
listeners are up to tonight.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.988
Hello, you’re
on Heart of the Night.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.571
[John] Hello, Michelle.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.237
-Hello. And who is this?
-[John] I think you know.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.498
Listen, my friend, I take
over a hundred calls per show,

17:20.581 --> 17:22.541
so you may have
to refresh my memory.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.255
-[John] It’s John.
-Hello, John.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.755
What do you wanna
listen to tonight?

17:26.837 --> 17:28.047
[John] John Doe.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.470
I showed her.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.473
Come again, John?

17:31.592 --> 17:32.472
[John] I showed her.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.643
I showed her how I felt.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.801
What can I play for you, John?

17:35.930 --> 17:37.970
[John] Play
"If I Can’t Have You."

17:38.891 --> 17:40.481
Okay. Here it is.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.021
[John] How did you
like the rose?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.104
Excuse me?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.230
[John] I said,

17:45.314 --> 17:46.574
how did you like the rose?

17:46.649 --> 17:48.109
I wanted to thank
you for the advice.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.364
Hence, the rose.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.735
Here’s "I Can’t Have You"
for John.

17:57.660 --> 17:58.950
What the hell was that about?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.948
[clears throat]

18:01.080 --> 18:03.870
This morning or afternoon,

18:03.958 --> 18:07.628
when I woke up,
there was a red rose at my door.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.963
It wasn’t Aiden?

18:09.880 --> 18:11.840
No. It was him.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.046
It was the caller, Lily.
You heard him.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.434
Like he said, maybe
he just wanted to thank you?

18:19.473 --> 18:20.933
It was at my home, Lily.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.017
-My home. Not the station.
-Okay. Yeah.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.064
No, no, no, no.
You’re right, you’re right.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.266
And there was a note.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.816
A note? What’d it say?

18:30.484 --> 18:31.614
For love.

18:38.868 --> 18:39.948
Hey.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.446
-You wanna get some food?
-I can’t.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.708
I gotta get home.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.712
-Aiden?
-Uh-hmm.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.754
Well...

18:47.835 --> 18:49.745
[exhales]

18:51.130 --> 18:52.880
-Lily.
-Hmm?

18:53.007 --> 18:54.297
What is it?

18:56.010 --> 18:58.260
Um, no.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.346
It’s probably nothing.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.603
But?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.693
But, uh,

19:07.355 --> 19:09.615
you know that caller, John Doe.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.150
He called, um, 20 minutes
after he was on the air.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.487
What did he say?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.741
Well, he explained who he was,

19:17.865 --> 19:20.235
I mean, as if I didn’t know,

19:20.368 --> 19:24.748
and then he proceeded to ask
for your cell phone number.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.922
It’s like the way he said it,

19:27.041 --> 19:28.711
you know, it was like...

19:28.793 --> 19:31.343
it was like almost a completely
reasonable request.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.710
Like he expected me
to give it to him.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.009
What did you say?

19:35.091 --> 19:36.301
Oh, I said unfortunately

19:36.384 --> 19:37.894
I don’t give out
personal information

19:38.010 --> 19:39.340
about our hosts.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.008
[sighs]

19:42.098 --> 19:45.178
And then he wanted me
to give you another message.

19:47.561 --> 19:48.851
What message?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.189
He said,

19:53.401 --> 19:55.071
"I’ll be watching you."

20:02.702 --> 20:03.742
[Michelle] Hey.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.655
What are you doing up?

20:06.747 --> 20:08.917
Well, I took a nap after work

20:09.041 --> 20:11.631
so that we could have
a couple hours together.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.252
[both chuckle]

20:13.337 --> 20:14.757
Hey, you okay?

20:14.880 --> 20:15.920
Yeah.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.218
Tough day at work?

20:18.050 --> 20:20.510
[sighs] How was your day?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.104
Fine.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.389
[indistinct]

20:25.683 --> 20:27.273
Let me get you here.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.860
[tense music]

20:47.455 --> 20:49.585
Maybe I can help you with that?

20:50.499 --> 20:51.579
Huh?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.208
[chuckles softly]

20:58.215 --> 20:59.295
Hey!

21:02.636 --> 21:04.216
[sighs]

21:04.305 --> 21:08.435
-Mm. Oh, you smell good.
-Mm, I needed a shower.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.482
Baby, what is it?

21:13.314 --> 21:14.654
It’s nothing.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.905
We finally get some time
alone together

21:18.986 --> 21:20.776
and you’re being so distant.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.530
Just hold me.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.778
Yeah.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.956
[dramatic music]

21:31.040 --> 21:33.290
[helicopter blade whirring
in distance]

21:35.252 --> 21:37.052
Thanks for taking the time
to meet with us, Stan.

21:37.171 --> 21:38.301
I know you wanna get home.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.170
For you, sweetheart, anything.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.139
Look, about the other day.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.929
I was just gauging how you felt.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.512
If you’re comfortable
with nights--

21:46.639 --> 21:48.519
No, that’s not why
I wanted to talk to you.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.139
Okay. What was it then?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.596
Michelle is being harassed.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.318
Harassed.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.858
Oh, okay.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.612
Uh, I’m sorry. Okay.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.703
We have policies
in place for this.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.161
We need to contact human
resources immediately

22:04.240 --> 22:05.700
-and document--
-No, not by somebody

22:05.783 --> 22:07.203
in the company, Stan.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.954
Well, then who?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.156
A caller.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.656
Caller.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.707
Dirty talker?

22:12.790 --> 22:14.290
No, not a dirty talker.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.595
He’s actually rather polite.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.000
[laughs]

22:18.087 --> 22:19.497
Um, after he was on the show,

22:19.588 --> 22:21.208
he called back
and he wanted her number.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.048
-For?
-What difference does it make?

22:24.134 --> 22:26.054
Well, as the host
of a popular radio show,

22:26.178 --> 22:27.218
it’s really not surprising.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.676
Michelle has loyal listeners

22:28.764 --> 22:30.564
who identify with her,
especially...

22:30.641 --> 22:33.021
[chuckles] considering
the nature of the show.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.352
Whoa, are you saying
that it’s her fault?

22:35.437 --> 22:37.517
I’m saying no such thing, Lily.
Come on.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.396
What I’m saying
is that it certainly

22:39.483 --> 22:40.983
is no surprise that one of her,

22:41.068 --> 22:43.358
shall we say,
less stable listeners,

22:43.445 --> 22:45.235
might develop a crush on her.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.327
And might think it’s perfectly
acceptable to call.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.239
You know? "Hey Michelle,
I know you. Let’s talk."

22:50.369 --> 22:52.539
Well, is there anything
we can do about it?

22:52.621 --> 22:54.251
Anything we can do about it?

22:54.373 --> 22:56.213
I mean legally? Practically?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.246
Technologically? I don’t--
I don’t know what you’re asking.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.668
I guess I don’t know either.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.264
Look. The bottom line is that

23:02.339 --> 23:03.919
Michelle feels unsafe.
As the station manager,

23:04.008 --> 23:05.258
you gotta do something.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.258
Oh, man.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.643
Michelle, all I can offer you

23:09.763 --> 23:13.933
is someone every evening
walks you safely to your car.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.774
That’s fine. I’ll be fine.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.018
God.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.896
I would hate to be a woman.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.236
[Lily] [scoffs] What an ass.

23:27.448 --> 23:28.948
What’d you want him to do?

is someone the person knows.

The caller?

He said...

29:44.032 --> 29:45.742
well, originally, he just called

I said at heart, not in brain.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.354
[Det. Olsen]
Anyway, this Michelle Hall,

32:54.431 --> 32:56.681
she’s being creeped out
by one of her callers.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.686
-I’m not surprised.
-Why not?

32:58.768 --> 33:00.438
-You ever listen to her show?
-Mm-mm,

33:00.520 --> 33:02.110
I never even heard of her until
she came into the station.

33:02.189 --> 33:04.479
She’s very sympathetic
to her callers.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.026
She’s very likable.

33:06.109 --> 33:09.359
Mostly, she’s got this
really sexy voice, you know.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.028
I mean I’d be surprised
if she didn’t have

33:12.115 --> 33:13.865
callers who were infatuated
with her.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.160
-Is she in danger?
-I don’t know.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.874
I mean, she didn’t strike me
as the kind of woman

33:17.996 --> 33:20.706
who scares easily or who would
just come into a station

33:20.832 --> 33:22.712
unless she didn’t think
something was wrong.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.504
-Give me some background.
-Okay.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.094
[birds chirping]

33:30.217 --> 33:30.717
[Aiden] Why didn’t you tell me
about this?

33:30.800 --> 33:31.720
I don’t know.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.301
Because I wasn’t sure.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.886
Because I didn’t know
if it was real or not.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.641
Well, it was real enough
for you to go to the police.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.563
Because of what happened today,
Aiden.

33:39.684 --> 33:40.734
[sighs]

33:40.810 --> 33:42.980
Okay, okay.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.903
I have an idea. We get married.

33:44.981 --> 33:47.231
-[scoffs] Come on, Aiden.
-What?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.569
That’s your brilliant idea
for how to stop a stalker?

33:49.694 --> 33:51.904
-To get married?
-I already wanted to already.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.358
You know that.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.868
But think about it.
It makes sense.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.740
How does it make sense?

33:56.826 --> 33:57.866
We get married.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.913
I go on your health insurance.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.328
Then I can work freelance.

34:01.414 --> 34:02.674
Again, I don’t see

34:02.749 --> 34:03.999
how that helps the situation.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.214
Then I can be with you all
the time.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.714
Work on your schedule.

34:07.796 --> 34:09.336
Protect you.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.092
I’m not gonna marry you
out of fear.

34:13.843 --> 34:15.093
Is this why
you didn’t wanna tell me?

34:15.220 --> 34:16.600
Why I didn’t tell you what?

34:16.680 --> 34:18.060
’Cause you knew
that I’d ask you to marry me?

34:18.139 --> 34:20.179
My God. Don’t be ridiculous.

34:20.267 --> 34:22.437
I’m not being ridiculous.
I’m being insightful.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.441
Do not try to psychoanalyze me,
Aiden, okay?

34:25.522 --> 34:26.772
You’re not that smart.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.278
[sighs]

34:31.361 --> 34:32.451
Aiden.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.951
[sighs]

34:34.072 --> 34:35.112
Gosh. Come on.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.030
I didn’t mean it like that.

34:38.952 --> 34:42.122
Babe, I’m sorry. Really. Okay?

34:42.205 --> 34:44.115
I’m just really, really tired.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.626
What do you want from me?

34:49.713 --> 34:51.463
You just hold me.

34:59.389 --> 35:02.429
[dramatic music]

35:38.261 --> 35:39.551
[Michelle] Have to admit
it’s kind of nice

35:39.679 --> 35:40.929
to get out of the studio.

35:41.014 --> 35:42.644
It just feels
a little claustrophobic

35:42.724 --> 35:43.814
in there sometimes.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.642
[Keith] You happy at Polaris?

35:45.727 --> 35:47.847
I mean, this whole caller thing
notwithstanding.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.855
Wow. Talk about
a conversation stopper.

35:51.983 --> 35:55.033
Sorry.
It’s just--oh, forget it.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.823
No. No. I’m sorry.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.325
Go ahead. What’s up?

35:58.406 --> 36:00.066
It’s just...

36:00.200 --> 36:01.950
I feel like
they’re taking advantage of you.

36:02.035 --> 36:03.835
Taking advantage of me how?

36:03.912 --> 36:06.212
I mean, you have the highest
rated show in that time slot.

36:06.331 --> 36:09.211
Okay.
So you think I should what,

36:09.292 --> 36:10.632
negotiate more money?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.210
Or maybe there
are some other places

36:12.337 --> 36:13.457
that would value you more.

36:13.546 --> 36:14.836
Like where?

36:15.965 --> 36:17.295
Maybe Clear Cell.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.390
-Gage?
-Huh?

36:22.514 --> 36:24.894
Robert Gage,
the CEO of Clear Cell.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.726
-You spoke to him?
-What?

36:26.810 --> 36:28.730
No. No. That’s just...

36:29.771 --> 36:31.861
[sighs] Man.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.150
Don’t worry.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.733
He approached me too.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.648
I told him I didn’t wanna talk
to you about it

36:36.736 --> 36:39.066
but he can be very persuasive.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.405
[Michelle]
I understand, Keith.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.660
Just forget about it.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.201
You ever thought
about it though?

36:43.284 --> 36:44.914
I mean like really.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.536
-What?
-[Keith] Leaving.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.371
I mean, I’m sure Clear Cell will
roll out the red carpet for you.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.037
I mean, they’re much
bigger than Polaris

36:51.126 --> 36:53.166
and their stock
has been consistently rising.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.173
Not to mention,
they’d probably put together

36:55.255 --> 36:56.425
a pretty nice package for you.

36:56.506 --> 36:57.836
Just for me?

36:58.883 --> 37:01.593
Well, me and Lily
could be a part of that package.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.390
[sighs]
Keith, I don’t wanna talk

37:03.471 --> 37:04.931
about this anymore.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.926
I just--I have enough
on my mind already.

37:07.016 --> 37:08.426
-Yeah. It’s...
-[Michelle] Please

37:08.518 --> 37:10.098
don’t try to work Lily on this,
okay?

37:10.186 --> 37:12.396
-Okay.
-I just don’t need her worrying

37:12.480 --> 37:13.940
that I might jump ship.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.783
What’s going on
with this caller of yours?

37:17.610 --> 37:18.900
I went to the police.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.277
The police? Seriously?

37:20.363 --> 37:21.823
Yeah.
He left a note on my car.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.278
-Threatening you?
-No.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.276
-It was a love note.
-[scoffs]

37:25.368 --> 37:26.908
Even worse.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.375
What did the cop say?

37:28.455 --> 37:30.375
What do you think they said?

37:30.457 --> 37:33.207
There’s no tangible threat
so there’s nothing they can do.

37:33.293 --> 37:34.843
And you have no idea
who it could be?

37:34.961 --> 37:35.921
That’s the thing.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.004
It could be anybody.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.130
Except for me and Lily.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.547
We’re in the station with you
when the calls come in.

37:42.635 --> 37:46.305
Uh, you two weren’t at the top
of my list anyways, so...

37:46.389 --> 37:47.809
Right after I graduated...

37:47.932 --> 37:49.812
Oh, you mean like yesterday?

37:49.893 --> 37:51.643
[chuckles] Very funny.

37:51.728 --> 37:53.098
Right after I graduated,

37:53.188 --> 37:54.898
I interned
at the station in Chicago.

37:54.981 --> 37:57.401
Terrestrial.
Old-school.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.944
One of the host, a young woman

37:59.027 --> 38:00.397
had a similar experience,
all right?

38:00.487 --> 38:03.157
This guy kept calling in
and, eventually,

38:03.281 --> 38:05.321
he showed up,
waiting for her to come out.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.120
And you know what happened
when she came out?

38:07.202 --> 38:08.292
He screamed.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.289
He literally screamed
and ran away.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.671
Hey, my point
is these guys are cowards.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.171
They just latch on to you

38:14.292 --> 38:15.632
because they can hear
your voice.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.130
And when they see you
in the real world,

38:17.212 --> 38:18.752
they just hightail
it out of there, all right?

38:18.838 --> 38:20.168
They’re not dangerous.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.428
They’re just incredibly sad
and incredibly lonely.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.635
I really hope you’re right.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.510
I am. I promise.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.639
Coffee’s on me. Let’s go.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.024
[Michelle] What’s up, Lily?

38:33.102 --> 38:35.402
Uh, preventing an ambush.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.482
-Stan, he wants to see us.
-Oh.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.185
-Just what I needed.
-Mm-hmm.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.187
Is it about the timeslot?

38:41.277 --> 38:42.647
-I’d imagine.
-Mm-hmm.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.067
I don’t know.
I just figured

38:44.197 --> 38:45.867
-I’d give you a heads-up.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.200
You’ve had enough
surprises lately.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.664
Thank you.

38:50.787 --> 38:54.037
So any new developments
this morning?

38:54.123 --> 38:56.793
[sighs] With John Doe, no.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.456
But with Aiden,

38:58.545 --> 38:59.845
he’s using the situation

38:59.921 --> 39:02.261
to try and convince me
to marry him.

39:02.382 --> 39:03.722
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.892
Tell me about it.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.550
But how is that gonna help?

39:07.637 --> 39:10.847
Oh, he said he can protect me.

39:10.932 --> 39:11.892
-[sighs]
-Yeah.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.016
Look, Michelle,

39:14.102 --> 39:15.732
you know, if you really
wanna marry him,

39:15.812 --> 39:17.522
there’s nobody else
who’s gonna be happier

39:17.605 --> 39:19.145
for you than me, okay?

39:19.232 --> 39:21.732
-Mm-hmm.
-But make sure you’re doing it

39:21.818 --> 39:25.148
for the right reasons
and not because of fear.

39:25.238 --> 39:29.368
Oh, yeah, I know. Of course.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.870
Let’s just get
this meeting over with.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.083
[sighs]

39:35.665 --> 39:36.925
Thanks for your time, ladies.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.920
I know you have a show to prep.

39:39.002 --> 39:40.712
Oh, did we have a choice?

39:40.795 --> 39:43.255
[Stan] I just wanted to see
if you’ve given any more thought

39:43.381 --> 39:44.921
to the change in timeslots?

39:45.049 --> 39:46.759
Well, we told you,
we like where we are.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.513
You like where you are?
It’s just the management.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.346
They’re liking mornings
more and more.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.101
-Which means?
-[Stan] Which means

39:53.224 --> 39:55.064
I can’t promise anything
officially,

39:55.143 --> 39:57.443
but if you agree to this move,

39:57.520 --> 40:00.360
it might come with a pay raise.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.440
Oh, sweetening the pot,
huh, Stan?

40:02.525 --> 40:04.775
Taking care of you
like I always do. You know that.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.613
Oh, you’re all heart, Stan.

40:06.696 --> 40:09.196
Come on, Lily. This could be
a good thing for all of us.

40:09.282 --> 40:12.622
So is it still our choice
or are we at the point

40:12.702 --> 40:14.292
where somebody else
is making those decisions?

40:14.370 --> 40:16.460
It is still your choice,
for now.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.881
But I can’t promise it always
will be, and that’s the truth.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.289
Thank you, Stan.
We’ll think about it.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.510
Now, if you don’t mind,
we have a show to prepare.

40:24.631 --> 40:28.221
All I’m asking is
for you to think about it.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.891
Be smart.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.604
What’s with giving him
the bum’s rush?

40:35.391 --> 40:38.231
Do you think it could be Stan?

40:38.311 --> 40:40.401
The caller?

40:40.480 --> 40:42.440
I mean, we both caught him
leering at us before.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.153
You said so yourself.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.243
[chuckles] I mean, sure,

40:46.319 --> 40:47.819
he has that dirty old man vibe

40:47.946 --> 40:50.066
but I’d expect him to start
hitting on you

40:50.156 --> 40:52.486
before he started harassing you.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.657
Well, that’s true,

40:54.744 --> 40:57.044
but what if he’s doing
this to frighten us

40:57.163 --> 40:58.833
into taking the morning
timeslot,

40:58.915 --> 41:02.135
making us think
that nights are too dangerous?

41:02.210 --> 41:04.130
I wouldn’t put it past him
necessarily

41:04.212 --> 41:07.842
but they could really
force us to move

41:07.966 --> 41:09.676
if they really wanted to.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.761
I know, but it’s like he said,
they wanna keep us happy.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.136
This way they have their cake
and eat it too.

41:16.224 --> 41:17.854
Hmm.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.516
Do you know if Stan
was in the studio

41:22.605 --> 41:24.855
when any of the calls came in?

41:24.941 --> 41:28.361
I don’t know, but he could have
easily stepped out to make them.

41:29.654 --> 41:31.784
Nah. But I would have
recognized his voice.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.204
No, that’s the thing.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.702
Whoever is doing this
is disguising their voice.

41:35.827 --> 41:39.287
They’re using a computer program
or something.

41:39.372 --> 41:41.752
That’s what I didn’t
realize at first.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.794
That’s why it disturbed me
so much.

41:43.876 --> 41:47.296
It’s...it’s unnatural sound.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.967
Nah, I still don’t think
it’s Stan.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.351
Hmm, but I guess it could be.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.679
I don’t know.

41:55.763 --> 41:58.393
What do you wanna do?

41:58.516 --> 41:59.726
I don’t know.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.311
Let’s just focus
on the show for now.

42:01.394 --> 42:04.234
It’s the only thing
keeping me sane.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.555
[exhales deeply]

42:10.903 --> 42:12.533
[dramatic music]

42:19.037 --> 42:20.077
[sighs]

42:24.917 --> 42:26.417
[Robert] Michelle.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.174
[sighs]

42:28.254 --> 42:29.714
Not now, Robert, okay?

42:29.797 --> 42:31.507
Look, can’t a guy
say a friendly hello?

42:31.591 --> 42:33.931
As if that’s all it ever
is with you.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.512
Now that you mentioned it,

42:35.595 --> 42:37.685
I’d be happy to discuss
my latest offer.

42:37.764 --> 42:40.434
Or have one
of your underlings do it?

42:40.516 --> 42:42.176
Underlings?

42:43.269 --> 42:46.109
Oh. [chuckles]
You mean, your coworker?

42:46.189 --> 42:48.939
Yeah. That was a dirty pull,
even for you.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.945
No. On the contrary,
that was upfront and generous.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.900
If one of the things
that’s holding you back

42:53.988 --> 42:56.528
is the welfare of your team,
then I just want them to know

42:56.616 --> 42:58.116
that they’ll be well
taken care of.

42:58.201 --> 42:59.791
Behind my back?

42:59.869 --> 43:01.249
[Robert] Just being aggressive.

43:01.329 --> 43:03.579
There’s nothing unethical
about that.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.294
Okay. If you say so.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.455
You know, Michelle, most hosts

43:08.586 --> 43:11.706
would consider themselves lucky
to be in your situation.

43:11.798 --> 43:13.508
You’re right, Robert.

43:13.633 --> 43:15.973
Thank you so much
for harassing me.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.644
Just remember, the shelf life
of a radio personality,

43:19.722 --> 43:22.642
even a good one,
isn’t as long as you think.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.305
I’ll remember that.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.305
Call me if you change your mind.

43:30.191 --> 43:31.651
What did you just say?

43:31.734 --> 43:35.244
I said call me
if you change your mind.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.741
Call you?

43:38.407 --> 43:41.987
Is there something that
you wanna say to me, Robert?

43:42.078 --> 43:44.658
About what?

43:44.789 --> 43:47.039
[sighs]

43:47.166 --> 43:48.286
Jeez.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.010
[Michelle sighs]

43:57.885 --> 44:00.595
[door lock clicks]

44:00.680 --> 44:02.260
[exhales]

44:28.833 --> 44:32.213
[eerie music]

44:52.857 --> 44:54.687
[indistinct radio chatter]

44:54.775 --> 44:56.855
[Michelle]
We just went through this.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.414
I know, but the timeline
is very important.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.660
So if you wouldn’t mind
walking me through it again.

45:01.741 --> 45:04.081
I came home.
I went straight to my bedroom.

45:04.160 --> 45:06.660
And you didn’t look
around the house before that?

45:06.746 --> 45:08.866
-No.
-And your front door was locked?

45:08.956 --> 45:10.996
-Yes. Yes. I’m positive.
-You’re sure?

45:11.083 --> 45:13.173
And I locked it as soon
as I got back inside.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.092
Deadbolt, just like
I’ve been doing recently.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.513
But before you entered
the bedroom,

45:17.590 --> 45:19.550
you didn’t notice anything?

45:19.634 --> 45:21.094
No. Nothing out of the ordinary.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.179
Have you noticed anything
missing from the home?

45:23.262 --> 45:25.562
[scoffs] I mean,
I haven’t really looked.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.770
You don’t really
have any valuables,

45:27.850 --> 45:29.270
something that somebody
would want?

45:29.393 --> 45:31.443
I don’t know.
Maybe some jewelry.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.272
It’s all still there though.

45:33.397 --> 45:35.857
-Wallet, credit cards?
-I have those with me.

45:35.942 --> 45:38.612
Detective, it’s obvious
this wasn’t a theft.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.526
Whoever is doing this is
just trying to scare Michelle.

45:40.613 --> 45:42.663
Well, what about you, Mr. Sykes.

45:42.782 --> 45:45.122
-Excuse me?
-Well, you said whoever it is

45:45.201 --> 45:46.621
is trying to frighten Michelle,

45:46.744 --> 45:49.204
but it’s you whose face
is scratched out.

45:49.288 --> 45:52.458
I just assumed,
as I thought we all did,

45:52.583 --> 45:55.753
that whoever is doing this
is obsessed with Michelle,

45:55.836 --> 45:56.956
and he wants me
out of the picture,

45:57.088 --> 45:58.458
literally and figuratively.

45:58.547 --> 45:59.797
I think it’s premature to assume

45:59.882 --> 46:01.432
-anything right now.
-[scoffs]

46:01.509 --> 46:02.799
So, Ms. Hall,

46:02.927 --> 46:05.637
does anyone else
have the key to your house?

46:05.763 --> 46:07.433
No. It’s just me and Aiden.

46:07.515 --> 46:09.565
No one else? Not a friend

46:09.642 --> 46:11.562
-or a neighbor or a coworker?
-No.

46:11.644 --> 46:12.904
And you still have your key?

46:12.979 --> 46:14.729
It wasn’t stolen or anything?

46:16.607 --> 46:18.317
So after you noticed
that the photographs

46:18.401 --> 46:21.151
had been defaced,
then what did you do?

46:21.237 --> 46:22.567
I called Aiden.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.492
And where were you, Mr. Sykes?

46:26.617 --> 46:29.287
-I was at my office.
-So early?

46:29.370 --> 46:31.080
I generally make my own hours.

46:31.163 --> 46:32.623
If I go in early,

46:32.707 --> 46:34.247
I can be home in time
for when Michelle wakes up.

46:34.333 --> 46:35.923
Then we can spend some time
together before her shift.

46:36.002 --> 46:38.752
Look, Detective, I know
that you have to take

46:38.838 --> 46:40.088
all of this information down.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.842
How are you going
to stop the person

46:41.966 --> 46:43.126
who’s doing this?

46:45.177 --> 46:47.427
Frankly, Ms. Hall,
I’m not sure we are.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.024
Oh, we’ll try. We’ll try.

46:50.141 --> 46:53.191
But a break-in with no
signs of forced entry

46:53.311 --> 46:55.271
and which nothing was taken,

46:55.354 --> 46:56.864
look, I’d be lying if I told you

46:56.981 --> 46:58.821
this will be a priority
for the department.

46:58.899 --> 47:01.489
-Can’t you dust for prints?
-[chuckles]

47:01.569 --> 47:05.029
Fingerprinting isn’t like
what you see on TV, Mr. Sykes.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.866
Even if we get usable prints,
which is rare,

47:07.950 --> 47:09.790
we still need a sample
to compare them to.

47:09.869 --> 47:12.449
Now, you know,
I think the best thing

47:12.538 --> 47:15.038
for Ms. Hall to do
is to be vigilant.

47:15.124 --> 47:16.884
Never go anywhere alone.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.671
Lock your doors.
Keep your eyes open.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.383
So exactly what I’ve been doing?

47:20.463 --> 47:21.673
This guy is a coward.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.336
He’s getting a cheap thrill.

47:23.424 --> 47:25.554
As soon as he sees
it’s not getting to you,

47:25.676 --> 47:27.216
he’ll back off.
I’m sure of it.

47:31.515 --> 47:34.635
[eerie music]

47:36.145 --> 47:38.565
You know, in some ways, I’d
feel better if it was a theft.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.727
And nothing was missing
from the home?

47:40.858 --> 47:42.358
[Det. Olsen]
Hmm, nothing she knows about.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.153
But that doesn’t
even really matter,

47:44.236 --> 47:46.946
because no professional thief
is going to scratch out

47:47.073 --> 47:49.243
her boyfriend’s face
from her photographs.

47:49.325 --> 47:51.665
So maybe the threat was
against the boyfriend?

47:51.744 --> 47:53.084
Yeah. That’s what I told her,

47:53.162 --> 47:54.542
but she doesn’t really
believe that,

47:54.622 --> 47:56.082
and I don’t either.

47:56.165 --> 47:58.045
You know, I hate to say it
but this thing

47:58.125 --> 48:00.125
-is gonna escalate.
-Yeah?

48:00.252 --> 48:01.502
Yeah. I mean, the calls

48:01.587 --> 48:03.507
and then stalking,

48:03.589 --> 48:04.879
breaking and entering.

48:04.965 --> 48:06.545
We both know where it’s going.

48:06.634 --> 48:09.934
I can’t keep a man on her 24/7.

48:10.054 --> 48:11.354
What about the boyfriend?

48:11.430 --> 48:13.430
Well, he’s around a lot.
That’s good.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.267
He works.
He’s got his own place.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.943
But he’s not
professional security.

48:18.020 --> 48:20.440
Which means that there’s
still an opening for someone

48:20.564 --> 48:22.774
who’s really motivated
to come in and hurt her.

48:22.858 --> 48:23.938
Of course.

48:24.026 --> 48:26.396
Well, you could always
dust for prints.

48:26.487 --> 48:28.067
I just don’t get that feeling.

48:28.155 --> 48:29.525
What feeling is that?

48:29.615 --> 48:32.575
Well, that this was a pro
with a sheet in the system.

48:32.660 --> 48:35.580
This has always felt personal.

48:35.663 --> 48:39.123
So if you can’t find him,
you know, you just gotta wait.

48:39.208 --> 48:42.038
-Until what?
-Till he strikes again.

48:42.128 --> 48:44.298
I’m afraid
that might be too late.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.472
[eerie music]

48:46.549 --> 48:47.549
[Stan] Lily.

48:47.633 --> 48:49.433
Come on in. Have a seat.

48:49.510 --> 48:51.300
-You got a minute?
-[Stan] Of course.

48:51.429 --> 48:52.549
And you’re early.

48:52.638 --> 48:53.758
The show doesn’t start
for a few hours.

48:53.848 --> 48:55.468
We go back a long ways, Stan.

48:55.558 --> 48:57.388
Indeed we do. What’s up?

48:57.476 --> 48:58.976
Is there anything
you wanna tell me?

48:59.103 --> 49:00.813
Anything I wanna tell you?

49:00.938 --> 49:02.978
I’m not sure what you mean.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.031
-Michelle’s caller.
-Michelle’s caller?

49:06.152 --> 49:07.652
-Uh-hmm.
-[Stan] Lily, I’m serious.

49:07.736 --> 49:09.986
I have no idea
what you’re talking about.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.157
[Lily sighs]

49:13.284 --> 49:14.834
Wait a minute.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.162
You think it’s me?

49:16.245 --> 49:17.585
No. It makes sense, Stan.

49:17.663 --> 49:19.123
You can’t be serious.

49:19.206 --> 49:20.326
You want us to move to mornings,

49:20.458 --> 49:21.998
so--you don’t wanna
strong-arm us,

49:22.126 --> 49:23.666
so you make some calls
to frighten Michelle

49:23.752 --> 49:25.502
and then maybe we move
on our own

49:25.588 --> 49:26.798
and then you look like the hero.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.921
You really think
I would do that?

49:29.008 --> 49:30.088
I mean, you’ve made some

49:30.176 --> 49:31.466
inappropriate
suggestions before?

49:31.552 --> 49:33.352
That’s not true.
I’m not that kind of--

49:33.471 --> 49:34.851
wait a minute.

49:34.972 --> 49:37.352
Lily, you mean when you first
started working here

49:37.475 --> 49:39.105
and I invited you over
for a drink?

49:39.185 --> 49:41.695
Well, you were my boss.
I was your subordinate.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.692
-I mean, it was inappropriate.
-You’re ridiculous.

49:43.772 --> 49:45.862
It was a different time, Lily.
My God.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.321
Yeah, well, still inappropriate.

49:47.401 --> 49:48.941
Do you really not see
the difference

49:49.028 --> 49:51.358
between someone asking
a hot-looking coworker

49:51.489 --> 49:53.029
like yourself for a drink

49:53.157 --> 49:55.867
and what that freak
is doing to Michelle?

49:55.951 --> 49:58.541
Look, I can’t believe
I even have to justify myself,

49:58.621 --> 50:00.211
but if it makes you feel better,

50:00.331 --> 50:02.121
for the record,

50:02.208 --> 50:05.668
I have nothing to do with
what’s happening to Michelle.

50:08.464 --> 50:09.554
Hmm.

50:13.344 --> 50:16.224
[Michelle] That was I Can Feel
Your Love All Night Long

50:16.305 --> 50:17.685
by the Locomotives.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.815
If I had a nickel
for every school dance

50:19.892 --> 50:21.482
where I slow-danced
to that song,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.480
but let’s hear from our callers.

50:23.562 --> 50:25.732
I wanna hear what songs
you slow-danced to

50:25.814 --> 50:27.574
when you were young and stupid.

50:32.238 --> 50:33.238
Hello, Curtis.

50:33.322 --> 50:34.992
Welcome to Heart of the Night.

50:35.074 --> 50:38.414
Tell me what songs did you find
magic with in that school gym?

50:38.494 --> 50:40.664
[Curtis] Oh, man.
There were so many.

50:40.746 --> 50:42.996
Heaven by Bryan Adams,

50:43.082 --> 50:45.752
Faithfully by Journey,
Beth from Kiss.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.876
Oh, Curtis,
you’re bringing me back.

50:47.962 --> 50:50.922
[Curtis] And my favorite,
My Boyfriend’s Photo.

50:53.842 --> 50:55.592
I don’t think I know that one.

50:55.678 --> 50:57.428
[Curtis] Sure you do, Michelle.

50:57.513 --> 50:59.603
It’s the one
where the woman comes home

50:59.682 --> 51:01.432
to find that someone’s
been in her house

51:01.517 --> 51:04.097
and destroyed all the pictures
of her boyfriend.

51:08.440 --> 51:09.690
Who is this?

51:09.775 --> 51:12.105
[Curtis]
I think you know, Michelle.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.196
I think you’ve always known.

51:18.200 --> 51:22.040
[suspenseful music]

51:33.632 --> 51:35.632
[Keith] I’ll do whatever you
ask, Michelle. You know that.

51:35.718 --> 51:39.098
Look, Keith,
don’t take this the wrong way.

51:39.179 --> 51:41.259
We’ve just always been under
the impression

51:41.348 --> 51:45.478
that you’re involved
in some unsavory activities.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.770
We heard you’re a hacker.

51:49.815 --> 51:50.895
I got some skills.

51:50.983 --> 51:52.613
So you can help us.

51:52.693 --> 51:54.403
What do you need me to do?

51:54.486 --> 51:56.106
I need to find out
who’s calling me.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.906
The number is blocked.

51:57.990 --> 52:00.370
-Exactly.
-So what can I do?

52:00.492 --> 52:04.082
Well, you can hack into
the phone company’s servers.

52:04.163 --> 52:05.583
[chuckles]

52:05.664 --> 52:06.874
Lily, come on.

52:08.167 --> 52:10.457
-You’re serious?
-Uh-hmm.

52:12.046 --> 52:14.876
Okay. Well, then I should tell
you that the telecom companies

52:15.007 --> 52:16.927
have some of the best protected
networks in the world.

52:17.009 --> 52:18.589
I mean, you’re talking
about multiple layers

52:18.677 --> 52:20.047
of firewalls
and other fail-safes.

52:20.179 --> 52:21.429

a school or a local business.

and I’m guessing

social media accounts,

and even credit card receipts.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.653

is that gonna do?

Yeah. I’ll do it.

why you suspect Stan?

a prisoner in our own home.

1:02:41.258 --> 1:02:43.128
You don’t owe
that little dork anything.

1:02:43.218 --> 1:02:46.218
Yes, we do. He put his neck out
on the line for us.

1:02:46.304 --> 1:02:49.314
Plus, that’s not
even the main reason.

1:02:49.391 --> 1:02:50.731
Look, if we go to the police,

1:02:50.809 --> 1:02:52.479
they’re gonna ask us
how we got it,

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:54.150
just to find out
if it’s genuine.

1:02:54.229 --> 1:02:55.939
And if they find out the truth,

1:02:56.022 --> 1:02:58.322
Benjamin Sklar could get off.

1:02:58.441 --> 1:03:00.071
Yeah. If he’s arrested
on evidence

1:03:00.151 --> 1:03:01.821
that was acquired illegally,

1:03:01.903 --> 1:03:04.073
even the least competent
public defender

1:03:04.155 --> 1:03:06.815
-will be able to get him off.
-Uh-hmm.

1:03:06.908 --> 1:03:08.448
So what are you gonna do?

1:03:08.535 --> 1:03:11.255
You two have been planning
something.

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:13.329
Well, right now there’s
still the element of surprise,

1:03:13.456 --> 1:03:16.416
so Benjamin Sklar has no idea
we’re on to him.

1:03:16.501 --> 1:03:18.001
Yeah. We wanna keep it that way.

1:03:18.128 --> 1:03:20.168
And what if he finds out?

1:03:20.255 --> 1:03:22.425
There’s no way he could.

1:03:23.341 --> 1:03:26.261
Michelle,
the longer he is out there,

1:03:26.344 --> 1:03:28.434
the more trouble you’re in.

1:03:29.681 --> 1:03:30.931
I don’t think
he wants to hurt me.

1:03:31.016 --> 1:03:32.846
I just...
I think in his sick mind,

1:03:32.934 --> 1:03:34.644
he thinks he’s in love with me.

1:03:34.728 --> 1:03:35.978
You don’t know that.

1:03:36.062 --> 1:03:37.362
I don’t care how much insight

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:38.820
you think you have
from the show.

1:03:38.898 --> 1:03:40.528
-You could be in danger.
-Okay.

1:03:40.650 --> 1:03:43.280
-Well, what is your idea, Aiden?
-I threaten him.

1:03:43.361 --> 1:03:46.031
I tell him we know who he is
and what he’s been doing.

1:03:46.114 --> 1:03:47.954
And what good is that gonna do?

1:03:48.033 --> 1:03:49.533
It will scare him

1:03:49.617 --> 1:03:51.617
and then he’ll leave
Michelle alone.

1:03:51.703 --> 1:03:53.503
Well, we don’t want him scared.

1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:56.000
-We want him caught.
-Yeah.

1:03:56.875 --> 1:04:00.175
Then call the cops
and take your chances.

1:04:04.174 --> 1:04:06.054
[Det. Olsen]
Spell that again please.

1:04:06.176 --> 1:04:09.636
Okay. Now, he’s never threatened
you or anything?

1:04:09.721 --> 1:04:11.061
Oh, okay.

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:13.221
Yeah, I’ll look into it,
Ms. Hall.

1:04:13.350 --> 1:04:14.810
But unless you tell me why

1:04:14.893 --> 1:04:16.483
you suspect this neighbor
of yours,

1:04:16.561 --> 1:04:18.021
there’s just so much I can do.

1:04:18.104 --> 1:04:19.154
Okay. Uh-hmm.

1:04:19.230 --> 1:04:21.900
Oh, okay. I’ll be in touch.

1:04:22.025 --> 1:04:23.325
Goodbye.

1:04:24.944 --> 1:04:26.574
Michelle Hall?

1:04:26.696 --> 1:04:29.406
She’s convinced
it’s her neighbor,

1:04:29.532 --> 1:04:31.082
Benjamin Sklar.

1:04:31.159 --> 1:04:34.079
-That name mean anything to you?
-Uh-uh. Why would it?

1:04:34.204 --> 1:04:35.964
Well, you know, I was hoping
he might have a record

1:04:36.081 --> 1:04:39.331
-and you’d recognize it.
-Uh-uh.

1:04:39.417 --> 1:04:42.167
-Why is she so sure it’s him?
-Wouldn’t say it.

1:04:42.253 --> 1:04:44.593
She just kept saying
how creepy he was.

1:04:44.714 --> 1:04:46.424
Well, creepy isn’t a crime.

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:48.759
You know, I know there’s
something she’s not telling me,

1:04:48.885 --> 1:04:50.255
-but--
-What?

1:04:50.387 --> 1:04:52.257
It wouldn’t hurt
to have a conversation with him,

1:04:52.389 --> 1:04:54.179
then I could see what kind
of vibe I get from him.

1:04:54.265 --> 1:04:56.225
Well, he could refuse
to talk to you, you know?

1:04:56.309 --> 1:04:58.979
He could, but then we’d know
he’s got something to hide.

1:04:59.104 --> 1:05:00.444
Or he knows his rights.

1:05:00.522 --> 1:05:02.322
Innocent men talk, Lisa.
You know that.

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.940
Only thing more certain
is that the husband did it.

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:06.738
Well, unfortunately, for you,
in this case,

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:08.280
there is no husband.

1:05:08.363 --> 1:05:11.243
[sighs] No, there isn’t.

1:05:12.242 --> 1:05:13.242
[groans]

1:05:19.249 --> 1:05:21.289
[Stan]
I think that’s a great idea.

1:05:21.418 --> 1:05:23.088
-You do?
-[Stan] Of course.

1:05:23.169 --> 1:05:26.459
You think I want an on-air host
who fears for her safety?

1:05:26.548 --> 1:05:27.628
-Nada.
-Hmm.

1:05:27.757 --> 1:05:29.627
-Thank you, Stan.
-No pressure.

1:05:29.717 --> 1:05:31.797
But how long do you think
you’ll be gone?

1:05:31.928 --> 1:05:33.968
Just a few days,
until we get this all sorted.

1:05:34.055 --> 1:05:35.425
[Stan] Of course. The...
well, the company

1:05:35.515 --> 1:05:37.065
will give you
any support you need.

1:05:37.142 --> 1:05:38.482
We’re in touch
with the authorities.

1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:40.140
-With the authorities?
-Uh-hmm.

1:05:40.270 --> 1:05:41.770
Well, I guess that’s best.

1:05:41.855 --> 1:05:43.115
Who do you think you’ll get
to fill in?

1:05:43.189 --> 1:05:44.819
Oh, I don’t know. A few days,

1:05:44.899 --> 1:05:46.729
I might just run
some of your old shows.

1:05:46.818 --> 1:05:49.818
Or maybe...
maybe give Wade a chance.

1:05:49.946 --> 1:05:51.486
-Hmm.
-He’s been on me for weeks

1:05:51.573 --> 1:05:53.243
about giving him more than
just a few segments

1:05:53.324 --> 1:05:54.914
of Bedside Bill and the Mailman.

1:05:54.993 --> 1:05:57.503
Oh, Wade is a ratings killer.

1:05:57.579 --> 1:05:59.079
I know. I hate the show.

1:05:59.164 --> 1:06:01.044
But, like I said,
it’s only a few days.

1:06:01.166 --> 1:06:03.786
I’m sorry but, Michelle,
I gotta ask you a question.

1:06:03.877 --> 1:06:05.167
This isn’t a ploy or anything

1:06:05.295 --> 1:06:07.925
just because I suggested
a new timeslot, is it?

1:06:08.006 --> 1:06:09.666
Because the decision is yours.

1:06:09.757 --> 1:06:12.127
If you say so, I will back off.

1:06:12.218 --> 1:06:13.838
How dare you, Stan?

1:06:13.970 --> 1:06:15.470
If this is about the request,
you’d know.

1:06:15.555 --> 1:06:16.645
And for the record, no,

1:06:16.723 --> 1:06:18.143
we’re not changing time slots.

1:06:18.224 --> 1:06:20.184
[Stan] Okay. Okay.
I just had to ask.

1:06:20.310 --> 1:06:22.270
Look, it’s probably
not appropriate to say

1:06:22.353 --> 1:06:24.023
enjoy your time off, but...

1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:29.110
I hope you take care
of whatever need to get done.

1:06:30.403 --> 1:06:32.033
Get out of my office, girls.

1:06:35.033 --> 1:06:36.953
You still think it could be him?

1:06:37.785 --> 1:06:40.325
No. I never really did.

1:06:41.456 --> 1:06:42.826
He’s not really
smart enough to pull

1:06:42.916 --> 1:06:44.326
something like this off anyways.

1:06:44.417 --> 1:06:47.207
Uh-uh.
And he doesn’t have the energy.

1:06:47.295 --> 1:06:48.675
True.

1:06:48.755 --> 1:06:51.555
-Wanna get something to eat?
-Why not?

1:06:51.674 --> 1:06:54.554
Who knows how long this stakeout
is gonna last.

1:06:58.681 --> 1:07:01.391
[Lily] What if he works
the night shift like we do?

1:07:01.518 --> 1:07:02.938
No. That’s highly unlikely.

1:07:03.061 --> 1:07:05.561
It says online
he’s a marketing executive.

1:07:05.688 --> 1:07:08.068
Plus, he makes all those calls
to the radio station at night.

1:07:08.191 --> 1:07:10.401
He wouldn’t be able
to do that from work.

1:07:10.485 --> 1:07:12.075
What if he doesn’t come
straight home,

1:07:12.153 --> 1:07:13.903
like if he goes
to a girlfriend’s or something?

1:07:13.988 --> 1:07:16.408
You think this psycho
has a girlfriend?

1:07:16.533 --> 1:07:17.533
-Hmm.
-No way.

1:07:17.617 --> 1:07:19.077
That’s why he’s calling me.

1:07:19.202 --> 1:07:20.582
[Lily] What if he goes
to like a restaurant

1:07:20.662 --> 1:07:22.502
-or like a bar or...
-Oh, my God.

1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:23.750
Would you stop it, Lily?

1:07:23.831 --> 1:07:25.081
-What?
-We decided.

1:07:25.208 --> 1:07:27.498
We’re gonna wait
until we see him.

1:07:27.585 --> 1:07:28.915
[Lily] And then what?

1:07:29.003 --> 1:07:30.633
And then we see where he goes

1:07:30.755 --> 1:07:32.255
and what he does.

1:07:32.382 --> 1:07:33.762
And then what?

1:07:34.676 --> 1:07:37.006
Then we let him know
that we’re watching.

1:07:37.929 --> 1:07:39.759
[Lily]
So where do you think he is?

1:07:39.847 --> 1:07:41.057
[Michelle] Who knows?

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:42.680
Maybe he’s working late.

1:07:42.767 --> 1:07:44.597
Well, we have his
cellphone number, you know?

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:47.267
No, not yet.
Plus, even if we call,

1:07:47.355 --> 1:07:48.735
that won’t tell us where he is.

1:07:48.815 --> 1:07:50.945
Well, if we’re
gonna be here all day,

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:53.107
why don’t we go in shifts?

1:07:53.194 --> 1:07:55.284
You wanna take the first watch?

1:07:55.363 --> 1:07:57.573
No. You got it.

1:07:57.657 --> 1:07:59.907
I wanna catch some Zs right now.

1:07:59.993 --> 1:08:01.293
Let me know if anything changes.

1:08:01.411 --> 1:08:02.621
Yeah.

1:08:11.629 --> 1:08:14.799
[suspenseful music]

1:08:19.887 --> 1:08:21.257
[door creaks opens]

1:08:21.347 --> 1:08:23.057
What are you doing here?

1:08:27.937 --> 1:08:30.477
[panting]

1:08:30.607 --> 1:08:31.517
Michelle!

1:08:31.649 --> 1:08:33.189
-Look.
-What?

1:08:33.985 --> 1:08:36.325
Oh, my God.
I don’t believe this.

1:08:36.446 --> 1:08:37.656
I thought he had plans.

1:08:37.739 --> 1:08:39.779
That’s what he told me.

1:08:40.700 --> 1:08:42.160
Hey!

1:08:42.285 --> 1:08:43.995
-Michelle.
-Get inside.

1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:45.960
I...

1:08:46.039 --> 1:08:47.579
[sighs]

1:08:51.336 --> 1:08:54.916
-What the hell are you doing?
-What do you think I was doing?

1:08:55.006 --> 1:08:57.506
-Even after I asked you not to?
-Well, what do you expect?

1:08:57.592 --> 1:08:59.642
My girlfriend is being harassed
by some freak.

1:08:59.719 --> 1:09:01.099
We find out
it’s the next-door neighbor

1:09:01.179 --> 1:09:02.299
and I can’t do
anything about it?

1:09:02.388 --> 1:09:03.848
How do you think
that makes me feel?

1:09:03.973 --> 1:09:05.393
I don’t really care
how it makes you feel, Aiden.

1:09:05.516 --> 1:09:06.676
This is about me.

1:09:06.809 --> 1:09:08.099
Fine.

1:09:09.395 --> 1:09:11.015
[sighs]

1:09:11.147 --> 1:09:12.817
What were you even gonna do?
Beat him up?

1:09:12.899 --> 1:09:15.149
Maybe?
I didn’t think that far ahead.

1:09:15.234 --> 1:09:17.154
-[sighs]
-And what were you doing?

1:09:17.236 --> 1:09:18.776
Why are you two
watching Sklar’s house?

1:09:18.863 --> 1:09:20.323
We’re keeping an eye on him.

1:09:20.406 --> 1:09:22.156
And you told me
not to confront him?

1:09:22.241 --> 1:09:23.871
We weren’t going
to confront him, okay?

1:09:23.951 --> 1:09:25.121
We’re just watching him.

1:09:25.203 --> 1:09:27.163
We’re seeing when he gets home,

1:09:27.246 --> 1:09:29.366
when he leaves, what he does.

1:09:29.499 --> 1:09:32.709
-What did you find out?
-Nothing. He never came home.

1:09:32.835 --> 1:09:34.335
[sighs] All right.

1:09:35.129 --> 1:09:36.379
I’m gonna take a shower.

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:38.466
Clear my head.

1:09:38.549 --> 1:09:39.679
I’m sorry.

1:09:41.719 --> 1:09:42.849
It’ll be okay.

1:09:48.184 --> 1:09:50.734
Well, he’s devoted.
I’ll give him that.

1:09:50.812 --> 1:09:52.692
[Michelle] You think
we should try Sklar’s office?

1:09:52.772 --> 1:09:54.862
Uh-hmm.
Yeah, ’cause if he’s there,

1:09:54.941 --> 1:09:56.281
at least we know he’s not home.

1:09:56.401 --> 1:09:57.861
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:10:00.655 --> 1:10:02.325
[phone rings]

1:10:02.407 --> 1:10:03.867
[man] Good morning. Marketing.

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:06.700
Hi. I’m trying to reach
Benjamin Sklar.

1:10:06.786 --> 1:10:08.996
[man] Mr. Sklar
is not in right now.

1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:10.710
-Can I take a message?
-Oh, really?

1:10:10.790 --> 1:10:12.580
I had a call scheduled with him.

1:10:12.667 --> 1:10:14.497
Do you know when he’ll return?

1:10:14.585 --> 1:10:17.415
[man] Uh, Mr. Sklar hasn’t been
in this entire week

1:10:17.547 --> 1:10:20.337
and frankly we’re not
really sure where he is.

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:22.840
Thank you very much.

1:10:24.595 --> 1:10:28.595
So if he’s not at home,
he’s not at work, where is he?

1:10:30.518 --> 1:10:32.058
He could be at home.

1:10:32.979 --> 1:10:35.859
You mean, in there cooped up
the entire time?

1:10:39.193 --> 1:10:40.573
How do we find out?

1:10:45.324 --> 1:10:47.794
Michelle Hall,
soft rock DJ by day,

1:10:47.869 --> 1:10:49.289
cat burglar by night.

1:10:49.370 --> 1:10:51.410
Actually, in your case,
it’s DJ by night,

1:10:51.497 --> 1:10:52.787
cat burglar by day.

1:10:52.874 --> 1:10:54.544
I’m glad we could
amuse you, Keith.

1:10:54.625 --> 1:10:56.285
Now, can you help us or not?

1:10:57.754 --> 1:11:00.134
I’m not really sure how I feel
about you coming to me

1:11:00.256 --> 1:11:02.966
every time something illegal
needs to be done.

1:11:03.050 --> 1:11:04.970
Hmm. So do you want me
to tell Accounting

1:11:05.052 --> 1:11:08.432
to take a closer look
at your expense reports, hmm?

1:11:08.514 --> 1:11:10.474
-Your wish is my command.
-Hmm.

1:11:10.558 --> 1:11:12.638
-So you can do it?
-Depends on the lock.

1:11:12.727 --> 1:11:14.647
How would I know
what kind of lock he has?

1:11:14.729 --> 1:11:17.479
Get a picture of it? Or you said
he was your neighbor, right?

1:11:17.565 --> 1:11:19.445
-Yeah.
-Do you know if all the houses

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:21.395
in your neighborhood were built
around the same time?

1:11:21.486 --> 1:11:23.986
-I don’t know.
-Okay. Well, let’s assume so.

1:11:24.071 --> 1:11:25.741
Do you have your key?

1:11:34.081 --> 1:11:36.171
-What are you doing?
-All keys are stamped

1:11:36.292 --> 1:11:38.132
with a code to identify
the type of lock.

1:11:38.211 --> 1:11:39.751
Yeah, I can pick it.

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:42.010
Thank you, Keith.

1:11:42.089 --> 1:11:43.339
As soon as I hear that click,

1:11:43.466 --> 1:11:44.676
I’m out of there. Got it?

1:11:44.759 --> 1:11:46.639
I don’t know
what you two have planned.

1:11:46.719 --> 1:11:50.179
I definitely don’t wanna be
there when the cops come, okay?

1:11:50.306 --> 1:11:52.426
This might be a surprise
to you two but I might have had

1:11:52.517 --> 1:11:54.477
a little legal trouble
in the past.

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:58.020
We get it. Once you open
the door, you’re a ghost.

1:11:58.105 --> 1:11:59.015
When?

1:12:05.279 --> 1:12:07.199
[suspenseful music]

1:12:34.058 --> 1:12:36.138
[Michelle sighs]

1:12:36.227 --> 1:12:37.557
Maybe we should knock?

1:12:37.645 --> 1:12:38.655
For what reason?

1:12:38.729 --> 1:12:39.809
To make sure nobody’s home.

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:40.897
We know that nobody’s home.

1:12:41.023 --> 1:12:42.233
This house is still dark.

1:12:42.358 --> 1:12:43.898
Okay. You guys can argue
all you want later.

1:12:43.985 --> 1:12:45.865
Are we doing this or not?

1:12:45.945 --> 1:12:47.915
-[Lily] Yeah.
-All right.

1:12:47.989 --> 1:12:50.159
Remember, as soon
as I hear the click,

1:12:50.241 --> 1:12:52.031
I’m out of here, all right?

1:12:55.246 --> 1:12:56.746
[lock clicks]

1:12:57.832 --> 1:13:00.082
-Good luck.
-Thanks, Keith.

1:13:01.168 --> 1:13:03.748
[suspenseful music]

1:13:23.232 --> 1:13:24.942
[Lily] Oh, God.

1:13:26.569 --> 1:13:27.859
[sighs]

1:13:34.952 --> 1:13:37.042
Michelle, I don’t like this.

1:13:37.121 --> 1:13:38.331
-It’s okay. We’re fine.
-No, no, no.

1:13:38.456 --> 1:13:39.616
I really don’t like this.

1:13:39.749 --> 1:13:41.419
Lily, we have to be quiet.

1:13:41.500 --> 1:13:42.630
[sighs]

1:13:44.253 --> 1:13:45.463
Bedroom.

1:13:57.224 --> 1:13:58.434
[both gasps]

1:14:04.482 --> 1:14:06.982
[siren blares]

1:14:07.068 --> 1:14:09.818
[phones ringing]

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:11.566
[Michelle sighs]

1:14:11.656 --> 1:14:13.406
Are these really necessary?

1:14:27.672 --> 1:14:28.672
Thank you.

1:14:28.798 --> 1:14:30.128
Are you sure
you don’t want a lawyer?

1:14:30.216 --> 1:14:31.586
[Michelle] No.
I don’t want a lawyer.

1:14:31.676 --> 1:14:33.756
I told you, okay? I called you.

1:14:33.844 --> 1:14:35.934
-Ms. Hall, now we could--
-Please...

1:14:37.431 --> 1:14:39.181
can you call me Michelle?

1:14:40.851 --> 1:14:43.691
Michelle,
you broke into the home

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:46.193
of a man who was murdered.

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:47.685
Now, I know you called
the police,

1:14:47.817 --> 1:14:50.487
but certainly you can see
how this looks.

1:14:50.569 --> 1:14:52.199
-Where’s Lily?
-In another room

1:14:52.279 --> 1:14:53.699
with a colleague of mine.

1:14:53.781 --> 1:14:54.951
[scoffs]

1:14:55.032 --> 1:14:56.622
Are you trying to trip us up?

1:14:56.701 --> 1:15:00.201
Just making sure
your stories match. That’s all.

1:15:00.329 --> 1:15:03.539
I explained everything to you
on the ride over here.

1:15:03.624 --> 1:15:05.794
Can I be frank, Ms. Hall?

1:15:05.876 --> 1:15:08.126
I don’t think
you killed Mr. Sklar.

1:15:08.212 --> 1:15:09.552
For one thing,
you’re not a killer

1:15:09.630 --> 1:15:11.470
and if you were,
why would you call us?

1:15:11.549 --> 1:15:15.639
What’s more, you freely admitted
to breaking into the home.

1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:17.800
But what I can’t figure out,
for the life of me,

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:19.178
is why you thought

1:15:19.265 --> 1:15:21.235
it was Mr. Sklar
who was harassing you.

1:15:21.308 --> 1:15:23.558
If you tell me,
it could exonerate you.

1:15:23.644 --> 1:15:25.734
But, more importantly,
it could help us

1:15:25.855 --> 1:15:29.025
find who actually killed
Mr. Sklar.

1:15:29.108 --> 1:15:30.568
I told you I can’t.

1:15:30.651 --> 1:15:32.241
And why is that?

1:15:32.319 --> 1:15:36.489
I think it’s because
you’re protecting someone.

1:15:36.574 --> 1:15:38.414
-Is it Lily?
-[phone chimes]

1:15:38.492 --> 1:15:39.992
[Det. Olsen] Oh.

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:43.750
Excuse me a minute.

1:15:43.873 --> 1:15:45.673
[sighs]

1:15:50.838 --> 1:15:53.088
The coroner
did a preliminary report.

1:15:53.174 --> 1:15:58.104
It seems Mr. Sklar
has been dead for about a week.

1:15:58.220 --> 1:16:00.930
Now, we’ll get
an exact time after the autopsy.

1:16:01.057 --> 1:16:06.017
Okay. But if that’s true,
then he couldn’t have been

1:16:06.103 --> 1:16:07.563
the man who’s been stalking me.

1:16:07.646 --> 1:16:09.266
No, he couldn’t.

1:16:09.398 --> 1:16:12.438
Michelle, please, please,

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:14.898
is there anything
you wanna tell me?

1:16:22.203 --> 1:16:23.833
[siren blares]

1:16:23.954 --> 1:16:25.754
[Michelle]
We’re missing something.

1:16:25.831 --> 1:16:27.621
I just don’t know what it is.

1:16:27.708 --> 1:16:30.038
We need to go back and look
at the possible suspects again.

1:16:30.127 --> 1:16:31.747
Yeah, but who? Stan?

1:16:31.837 --> 1:16:33.507
I mean, that never felt right.

1:16:33.631 --> 1:16:35.591
It’s obviously not Keith.

1:16:35.674 --> 1:16:37.804
It’s somebody else.
It’s somebody I don’t know.

1:16:37.927 --> 1:16:40.797
Well, he must know you.

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:42.310
I don’t know. I don’t know.

1:16:42.389 --> 1:16:44.219
I just--I really
need to get some sleep.

1:16:44.308 --> 1:16:47.308
Yeah. I know. I know. Me too.
Is Aiden home?

1:16:47.394 --> 1:16:49.234
[sighs] I can’t even reach him.

1:16:49.313 --> 1:16:50.903
He’s probably
so pissed at me,

1:16:50.981 --> 1:16:52.981
which, honestly,
I can’t even blame him.

1:16:54.318 --> 1:16:55.938
Look, why don’t we both
get some sleep

1:16:56.028 --> 1:16:58.158
and then we’ll get a bite
to eat later.

1:16:58.239 --> 1:17:00.489
We’ll go over
everything again, okay?

1:17:00.574 --> 1:17:01.664
Stay safe.

1:17:01.784 --> 1:17:03.124
Yeah.

1:17:07.081 --> 1:17:08.541
So what do you think?

1:17:08.666 --> 1:17:09.996
I think
they’re hiding something.

1:17:10.084 --> 1:17:12.174
Well, of course
they’re hiding something, but...

1:17:12.253 --> 1:17:13.173
What?

1:17:13.295 --> 1:17:14.705
Well, they are not killers.

1:17:14.839 --> 1:17:16.009
At least, Michelle isn’t.

1:17:16.132 --> 1:17:17.972
But what about her friend?

1:17:18.050 --> 1:17:19.510
Not a chance.

1:17:19.635 --> 1:17:22.635
Well, she admitted
that she suspected Sklar

1:17:22.721 --> 1:17:25.521
and she also confessed
that she couldn’t tell us

1:17:25.599 --> 1:17:26.889
why she suspected Sklar.

1:17:27.017 --> 1:17:28.847
I figure
she’s protecting someone.

1:17:28.978 --> 1:17:30.018
-Lily?
-[Det. Olsen] No.

1:17:30.146 --> 1:17:31.356
I don’t think so.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:33.520
I’m afraid it’s the person
who killed Sklar.

1:17:33.607 --> 1:17:35.027
She might not even realize it.

1:17:35.151 --> 1:17:37.191
Well, if that’s true,
that’s aiding and abetting.

1:17:37.319 --> 1:17:38.489
I know.

1:17:38.571 --> 1:17:40.531
What if Sklar
really was stalking her

1:17:40.656 --> 1:17:42.486
and she caught him
and killed him?

1:17:42.575 --> 1:17:44.835
That’s not even premeditation.

1:17:44.910 --> 1:17:46.450
That’s self-defense.

1:17:46.537 --> 1:17:47.867
Well, why couldn’t
she tell us that?

1:17:47.997 --> 1:17:49.787
-She’s afraid.
-[Det. Olsen] I don’t know.

1:17:49.874 --> 1:17:52.044
Remember now,
she was still being stalked,

1:17:52.126 --> 1:17:54.126
even after the victim
was already dead.

1:17:54.211 --> 1:17:55.381
So she says.

1:17:55.504 --> 1:17:57.054
You think
she’s making it all up?

1:17:57.131 --> 1:17:59.721
I think there’s a lot more
going on here than we realize.

1:17:59.842 --> 1:18:01.802
And unless
we figure it out soon,

1:18:01.886 --> 1:18:04.046
there’s gonna be
another person dead.

1:18:08.392 --> 1:18:11.192
[helicopter blades whirring]

1:18:13.397 --> 1:18:16.187
[scoffs] No, no, no.

1:18:16.275 --> 1:18:17.485
Michelle.

1:18:17.568 --> 1:18:19.898
Robert,
I’m not in the mood right now.

1:18:20.029 --> 1:18:21.069
Not in the mood for what?

1:18:21.155 --> 1:18:22.495
For your offers

1:18:22.573 --> 1:18:24.993
or your threats
or your innuendos.

1:18:25.075 --> 1:18:26.575
Michelle.

1:18:26.702 --> 1:18:28.082
[car alarm beeps]

1:18:28.162 --> 1:18:29.752
Just heading to my car.

1:18:29.830 --> 1:18:31.750
-Robert.
-[sighs]

1:18:31.832 --> 1:18:33.882
I’m sorry, okay?

1:18:33.959 --> 1:18:35.249
I’m sorry.

1:18:35.336 --> 1:18:36.376
Are you okay?

1:18:36.462 --> 1:18:38.262
I honestly don’t know.

1:18:38.380 --> 1:18:41.430
Well, I wouldn’t
tell anybody that.

1:18:43.385 --> 1:18:45.925
If you need my help,
you let me know, okay?

1:18:51.894 --> 1:18:53.444
[car engine revs]

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:05.780
[sighs]

1:19:16.043 --> 1:19:18.133
[suspenseful music]

1:19:19.713 --> 1:19:20.963
Hello?

1:19:22.383 --> 1:19:23.593
Aiden?

1:19:32.434 --> 1:19:34.484
Hello, Michelle.

1:19:34.603 --> 1:19:36.403
Hello, Michelle.

1:19:38.399 --> 1:19:39.479
You?

1:19:40.567 --> 1:19:42.147
Never even
crossed your mind, did it?

1:19:42.278 --> 1:19:45.158
I don’t know if I should be
flattered or insulted.

1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:48.070
I don’t understand.

1:19:48.158 --> 1:19:49.488
Yes, you do.

1:19:49.618 --> 1:19:51.408
You just don’t wanna admit it
to yourself.

1:19:53.497 --> 1:19:56.327
Play If I Can’t Have You,
Michelle.

1:19:56.458 --> 1:19:57.828
Play it for me.

1:19:57.960 --> 1:19:58.960
You’re crazy.

1:19:59.044 --> 1:20:00.254
Crazy for you.

1:20:00.337 --> 1:20:01.667
Can’t you see that?

1:20:01.797 --> 1:20:03.627
I mean, do you have any idea
what it was like for me?

1:20:03.716 --> 1:20:05.336
What was like for you, Aiden?

1:20:05.467 --> 1:20:07.337
I have no idea
what you’re talking about.

1:20:07.469 --> 1:20:09.139
[Aiden] I would listen
to all your shows.

1:20:09.221 --> 1:20:11.351
Listen to you give all those
poor people advice.

1:20:11.432 --> 1:20:13.932
You’re so kind, so sympathetic.

1:20:14.018 --> 1:20:15.518
And then you would
come home to me

1:20:15.602 --> 1:20:17.272
and I would get
a different Michelle.

1:20:17.354 --> 1:20:20.194
Aiden, you and me,
that’s real life.

1:20:20.274 --> 1:20:23.534
My show, it’s--
I’m just playing a character.

1:20:23.652 --> 1:20:25.152
No.

1:20:25.237 --> 1:20:28.277
You can’t fake that kind
of emotion, that kind of heart.

1:20:28.365 --> 1:20:30.865
You gave all
of yourself to strangers.

1:20:32.786 --> 1:20:34.536
Why couldn’t
you save some of that for me?

1:20:34.621 --> 1:20:36.711
Look, I know
we had our problems, okay,

1:20:36.790 --> 1:20:38.670
but Aiden, I loved--

1:20:41.420 --> 1:20:43.210
I love you.

1:20:43.297 --> 1:20:44.507
That’s not true.

1:20:44.590 --> 1:20:47.300
I gave you
plenty of chances to show it.

1:20:47.384 --> 1:20:49.144
You don’t love me.

1:20:49.219 --> 1:20:51.299
I’m not sure
that you ever really did.

1:20:52.681 --> 1:20:54.851
What does Benjamin Sklar
have to do with any of this?

1:20:54.933 --> 1:20:57.063
Why did you have to kill him?

1:20:57.144 --> 1:20:59.734
Benjamin Sklar
was just collateral damage.

1:20:59.813 --> 1:21:01.113
I needed somewhere
close by to watch you

1:21:01.231 --> 1:21:02.571
when we weren’t together.

1:21:02.649 --> 1:21:04.229
Plus, I needed someone
to pin it on.

1:21:04.318 --> 1:21:07.068
The car, for example,
it led back to him.

1:21:07.154 --> 1:21:10.744
I didn’t actually think that you
were gonna break into his house.

1:21:10.866 --> 1:21:14.236
So when I saw you, you really
were going to his house?

1:21:14.370 --> 1:21:19.040
The best lie
is always wrapped in some truth.

1:21:19.124 --> 1:21:21.084
I was going over
to remove Sklar’s body

1:21:21.210 --> 1:21:22.540
so no one would find him.

1:21:22.628 --> 1:21:24.708
You thought I was going
over there to avenge you.

1:21:24.797 --> 1:21:27.047
Oh, my God.

1:21:27.132 --> 1:21:30.342
Aiden, did you really think
you could frighten me

1:21:30.427 --> 1:21:33.597
into your arms, into marriage?

1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:37.480
Well, I don’t have
to worry about that anymore.

1:21:37.601 --> 1:21:39.271
Neither of us do.

1:21:40.896 --> 1:21:43.226
[chuckles] That is sweet.

1:21:43.315 --> 1:21:46.435
[grunting]

1:21:59.415 --> 1:22:01.125
[groans]

1:22:01.959 --> 1:22:03.459
The police are on their way.

1:22:03.544 --> 1:22:04.964
Oh, my God.

1:22:05.045 --> 1:22:07.165
How did you know where to come?

1:22:07.297 --> 1:22:08.467
Keith.

1:22:08.549 --> 1:22:09.799
What do you mean?
What does--

1:22:09.883 --> 1:22:11.643
what does Keith
have to do with this?

1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:14.720
[pants] I went into the office
to pick up some stuff

1:22:14.805 --> 1:22:16.975
and Keith was there.

1:22:17.099 --> 1:22:19.979
I filled him in
about everything.

1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:21.600
Okay.

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:27.608
He mentioned how he saw Aiden
driving Benjamin Sklar’s car,

1:22:27.693 --> 1:22:29.243
you know,
through the drive-through.

1:22:29.319 --> 1:22:31.949
And I told him I had no idea
what he was talking about.

1:22:33.490 --> 1:22:36.830
He said he assumed
that we both knew

1:22:36.910 --> 1:22:38.620
it was Aiden in the car.

1:22:38.704 --> 1:22:42.424
I mean, I guess
they caught Aiden’s reflection

1:22:42.499 --> 1:22:44.289
in the side-view mirror.

1:22:44.376 --> 1:22:47.166
His face was so perfectly clear.

1:22:47.296 --> 1:22:51.506
And when I heard that,
I mean, I just knew.

1:22:51.592 --> 1:22:52.842
-I just knew.
-Uh-hmm.

1:22:52.968 --> 1:22:54.468
I called the police
and I came right over.

1:22:54.553 --> 1:22:57.683
[sirens wailing]

1:23:00.309 --> 1:23:03.439
[alarm blaring]

1:23:08.275 --> 1:23:11.705
[indistinct chatter]

1:23:40.432 --> 1:23:42.062
[Michelle]
Tell me, did that work, Ian?

1:23:42.184 --> 1:23:43.484
[Ian] It did.

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.900
This Friday will be
our six-month anniversary.

1:23:45.979 --> 1:23:47.399
We are happier than ever.

1:23:47.481 --> 1:23:49.401
That warms my heart, Ian.

1:23:49.483 --> 1:23:52.363
And it warms
this Heart of the Morning.

1:23:54.655 --> 1:23:56.825
Before we take a break,
Michael has been trying

1:23:56.907 --> 1:23:58.907
to call in for a while now.

1:23:59.034 --> 1:24:01.664
He’s requested
If I Can’t Have You.

1:24:01.745 --> 1:24:03.535
Thanks for hanging in there,
Michael.

1:24:03.622 --> 1:24:05.832
No, thank you, Michelle.

1:24:05.916 --> 1:24:09.086
[suspenseful music]

1:24:12.673 --> 1:24:15.683
[dramatic music]
