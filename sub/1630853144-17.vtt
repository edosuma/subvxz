ALICE: Sumi, I don't need
a sexual pleasure workshop,

00:04.091 --> 00:06.223
because my pleasure
comes from pleasuring you.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.660
Yes, and I want

So Gary Brecker,

fake health insurance claims

03:03.226 --> 03:04.836
Did six months in jail.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.664
Apparently,
he pled not guilty,

03:06.708 --> 03:08.057
because even though
he didn't complete

03:08.100 --> 03:09.406
any degrees in psychology,

03:09.450 --> 03:11.103
he still felt
that he was qualified

03:11.147 --> 03:12.453
to practice anyway.

he still has feelings
