WOULD YOU WAKE ME UP
IN 7 MINUTES?

01:31.307 --> 01:34.609
AHH, DOUGLAS. ARE YOU
GOING OUT, BY ANY CHANCE?

01:34.676 --> 01:36.827
WELL, I'M PUTTING ON
A COAT, SO...

01:38.564 --> 01:40.998
I'M GONNA LET YOU

01:41.066 --> 01:44.636
SORRY. I LIVE IN A BASEMENT
WITH NO INSULATION.

01:44.703 --> 01:47.472
I PUT ON A COAT
TO WATCH TV.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.608
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

01:49.675 --> 01:51.927
ANYWAY, DO ME A SOLID
AND DROP ME OFF IN THE CITY.

01:51.994 --> 01:53.828
I'M GONNA HANG WITH MY
FRIENDS IN THE VILLAGE.

01:55.664 --> 01:56.764
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:58.267 --> 01:59.518
WHY NOT?

01:59.585 --> 02:01.002
BECAUSE CARRIE AND I, WE'RE
GOING TO SEE DEACON AND KELLY,

02:01.070 --> 02:02.937
AND IT'S IN
THE OTHER DIRECTION.

02:03.005 --> 02:05.323
DARLING,

02:05.391 --> 02:06.541

LOVE YOU.

02:08.043 --> 02:12.614
FINE. MAYBE I SHOULD JUST HOP
A FREIGHT TRAIN, LIKE A HOBO?

02:12.681 --> 02:13.415
MAKE SURE
YOU BRING SOME BEANS,

02:13.566 --> 02:14.833
SO THE OTHERS

DON'T MENTION ANYTHING TO
DOUG, ALL RIGHT? I'M JUST-

04:55.210 --> 04:56.477

04:56.545 --> 04:58.696
I ACTUALLY FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.

04:58.764 --> 05:01.165
REALLY GOOD.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.501
PERHAPS YOU COULD HAVE
YOUR THERAPIST WORK ON

05:03.569 --> 05:05.220
MAKING YOU LESS

05:07.840 --> 05:10.141
WOW. WE ARE MAKING
GREAT TIME.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.143
WE'RE GONNA BE IN THE
CITY IN, LIKE, 5 MINUTES.

WE ARE WHIZZING ALONG,
AREN'T WE?

05:13.979 --> 05:17.148
YEAH, THANKS TO YOU, I
CAN USE THE CARPOOL LANE.

05:17.216 --> 05:18.599
HA! YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

05:18.667 --> 05:20.534
YOU SHOULD RENT YOURSELF
OUT TO SINGLE DRIVERS.

05:20.602 --> 05:22.170
I BET YOU'D MAKE
SOME GREAT MONEY.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.338
YES! I BET
I COULD!

05:26.091 --> 05:27.725
I BET I COULD.

05:32.330 --> 05:36.701
"BUT JIMMY SOON LEARNED
THIS WAS NO ORDINARY PEN.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.569
"THIS WAS A MAGICAL PEN.

05:38.637 --> 05:41.740
"IF HE DREW A SNOWMAN
WITH IT, SHAZAM!

05:41.807 --> 05:43.441
"THERE WAS A SNOWMAN-"

05:43.542 --> 05:45.592
"RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF HIS ROOM."

05:45.660 --> 05:48.963
"RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF HIS ROOM." YES.

05:49.031 --> 05:51.899
"IF HE DREW A CASTLE
WITH IT, PRESTO!"

05:51.917 --> 05:54.619
"THERE'S A CASTLE,
AND HE WAS THE KING!"

05:54.670 --> 05:56.821
YOU KNOW THIS STORY
PRETTY WELL, HUH?

05:56.889 --> 05:58.123
I KNOW IT BY HEART.

05:58.224 --> 06:00.341
OH, OK.
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

06:00.409 --> 06:01.976
AHEM.

06:02.044 --> 06:05.380
"AND BEST OF ALL, ONE NIGHT,
WHEN JIMMY COULDN'T SLEEP,

06:05.447 --> 06:07.114
"THE MAGICAL PEN-"

06:07.183 --> 06:10.985
"DREW BIG, FLUFFY SHEETS
FOR JIM AND THE CLOWN."

06:11.053 --> 06:14.305
UH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT SAYS HERE AT ALL.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.107
IT SAYS, UH...

06:16.174 --> 06:19.727
"THE MAGICAL PEN GRABBED
ITS STOMACH AND THREW UP."

06:22.464 --> 06:26.166
"AND HE THREW UP A BIG,
GIANT LOBSTER MAN

06:26.285 --> 06:29.470
"WITH GIANT CLAWS

06:29.538 --> 06:31.656
"BUT WITH
REGULAR PEOPLE FEET."

06:34.259 --> 06:37.295
"AND-AND THEN HE STARTED
GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER

06:37.362 --> 06:39.631
"TO JIMMY'S BED, AND JIMMY
SCREAMED, 'OH, NO, NO!

06:39.698 --> 06:41.766
"'PLEASE, DON'T HURT ME!
NO, PLEASE!'

06:41.834 --> 06:44.869
"AND THE LOBSTER MAN SAID,
'I'M GONNA SNAP YOUR NECK

06:44.936 --> 06:46.638
'AND EAT YOU,

06:46.705 --> 06:50.641
"'AND YOUR FAMILY WILL
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN!'"

06:53.612 --> 06:55.513
"AND-AND THEN-

06:55.581 --> 06:57.749
"EVERYBODY JUST
STARTED LAUGHING."

07:00.302 --> 07:01.802
NO, 'CAUSE IT WAS ALL
- IT WAS JUST ALL A BIG GOOF.

07:01.870 --> 07:04.572
IT WAS ALL A GOOF,
YOU KNOW?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.257
AND THEN,
LOBSTER MAN SAID,

07:06.325 --> 07:09.026
"HEY, EVERYBODY,
LET'S DANCE!"

07:09.094 --> 07:11.762
AND THEN-AND EVERYBODY, THEY
ALL GRABBED JIMMY AND THEY-

07:11.831 --> 07:14.065
THEY THREW HIM UP
ON A CHAIR.

07:14.133 --> 07:18.753
YOU KNOW, LIKE AT
A BAR MITZVAH. AND-

07:18.820 --> 07:20.871
AND HE'S NOT EVEN
JEWISH, SO THAT SHOWS YOU

07:20.939 --> 07:23.541
HOW MUCH THEY LIKE JIMMY,
YOU KNOW, RIGHT THERE.

07:23.608 --> 07:24.842
THE END!

07:27.179 --> 07:30.314
OK. YOU GOOD? YOU LOOK
GOOD. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

07:30.382 --> 07:31.382
GOOD NIGHT.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.438
NO, KELLY,
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

07:37.505 --> 07:40.007
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
TO DO WHAT'S BEST.

07:40.075 --> 07:42.643
OH, WE WOULD'VE LOVED TO HAVE THE
LITTLE GUY HERE FOR THE WEEKEND,

07:42.710 --> 07:45.146
BUT IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO
STAY HERE, HE SHOULDN'T.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.784
ALL RIGHT. I'LL TALK
TO YOU SOON, HONEY.

07:49.851 --> 07:51.619
BYE-BYE.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.721
GIVE MAMA
SOME SUGAR, BABY.

07:55.957 --> 07:57.007
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

07:57.075 --> 07:58.676
WE'RE NOT GETTING MAJOR
FOR THE WEEKEND.

07:58.744 --> 07:59.827
WHAT?
YEP.

07:59.895 --> 08:01.162
THEY'RE DUMPING HIM
SOMEWHERE ELSE

08:01.229 --> 08:05.032
BECAUSE YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF THAT KID LAST NIGHT.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.651
DID YOU-DID YOU
DO THAT FOR ME, BABY?

08:06.718 --> 08:09.420
BECAUSE IF YOU DID, I-

08:09.487 --> 08:11.088
ONE SECOND.

08:12.424 --> 08:14.808
HE-HE'S STILL SCARED
FROM MY STORY?

08:14.876 --> 08:16.677
YEAH. WHAT'D YOU SAY
TO HIM, ANYWAY?

08:16.745 --> 08:19.597
I MEAN, KELLY SAID HE MADE
THEM THROW OUT ALL THEIR PENS.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.749
TOLD A LITTLE STORY
ABOUT A MAGICAL PEN

08:22.817 --> 08:26.087
THAT THROWS UP A HALF-MAN
LOBSTER THAT EATS LITTLE BOYS.

08:27.722 --> 08:28.990
WELL, THAT'S CREEPY.

08:29.057 --> 08:31.375
OK, A BIG, BAD WOLF CAN EAT A
GRANDMA, BUT I'M OUT OF LINE.

08:31.443 --> 08:33.711
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
COME ON. CALM DOWN. ANYWAY,

08:33.779 --> 08:36.163
KELLY SAID MAJOR IS DOING
BETTER NOW. IT'S ALL FINE.

08:36.231 --> 08:38.881
IT'S NOT FINE. OK?
I TERRIFIED A CHILD-

08:38.950 --> 08:41.184
MY GODSON-
SO MUCH THAT HE-

08:41.253 --> 08:43.386
HE WOULDN'T EVEN
SET FOOT IN MY HOUSE.

08:43.455 --> 08:45.556
I KNOW! GIVE MAMA
SOME SUGAR! COME ON!

08:45.624 --> 08:47.024
WILL YOU STOP IT?!

08:47.092 --> 08:50.094
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I
MEAN, KIDS LIKE ME. YOU KNOW?

08:50.161 --> 08:52.997
THEY RUN TO ME.
THEY CLIMB ON ME.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.165
YOU THINK I STAYED
THIS SIZE FOR MYSELF?

08:56.935 --> 08:58.202
THIS IS FOR THE CHILDREN.

09:04.342 --> 09:06.894
THIS CARPOOL LANE
IS MARVELOUS, ISN'T IT?

09:06.962 --> 09:08.595
YEAH, I'M GLAD
I SAW YOUR AD.

09:08.664 --> 09:09.864
BY THE WAY,

09:09.931 --> 09:12.466
MY SERVICE
ALSO INCLUDES CHITCHAT.

09:12.534 --> 09:14.652
HOWEVER, IF YOU WANNA TALK
POLITICS, I SHOULD WARN YOU.

09:14.719 --> 09:17.154
I HAVE SOME
VERY STRONG OPINIONS.

09:17.222 --> 09:19.857
THAT'S OK.
I KINDA LIKE IT QUIET.

09:19.925 --> 09:24.095
HURTFUL MESSAGE RECEIVED.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.313
EXCUSE ME.

09:26.381 --> 09:29.116
SHOTGUN ARTIE'S,
WE GET YOU THERE QUICKER.

09:30.185 --> 09:34.088

HMM. HOLD ON.

09:34.155 --> 09:35.523
I'VE ALREADY
GOT A PICKUP THEN,

09:35.590 --> 09:37.074
BUT I DON'T WANNA MISS
AN AIRPORT FARE.

09:37.142 --> 09:38.526
WHAT SHOULD I DO HERE,
CAL, HUH?

09:38.593 --> 09:41.229
UM, I'M NOT
REALLY SURE.

09:41.296 --> 09:43.814
COULD YOU PUT
YOUR SHOES BACK ON?

09:45.550 --> 09:46.651
DON'T YOU WORRY.

09:46.718 --> 09:49.520
SOMEBODY WILL BE THERE.

09:49.588 --> 09:52.306
WHO WANTS TO MAKE
SOME EASY MONEY? HMM?

10:02.217 --> 10:04.268
HEY.

10:14.245 --> 10:16.013
BEST 2 YEARS OF MY LIFE.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.949
HEY, IS,

10:20.752 --> 10:22.986
JUST WANNA SAY HELLO TO
THE LITTLE GUY, THAT'S ALL.

10:23.054 --> 10:24.705
NO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

10:24.773 --> 10:25.573
OH, MAN,
I'M HIS GODFATHER.

10:25.724 --> 10:26.957
I JUST WANNA
SAY HELLO TO-

10:27.025 --> 10:28.025

THAT DAMN STORY

10:28.093 --> 10:29.326
ABOUT A KILLER LOBSTER.

10:29.394 --> 10:31.445
OK, IT WAS
A LOBSTER-MAN,

10:31.513 --> 10:33.447
HALF MAN,
HALF LOBSTER.

10:33.515 --> 10:36.700
KILLER LOBSTER.

AND HE'S IN JAIL.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.806
SO NOW YOU CAN COME TO UNCLE
DOUG AND AUNT CARRIE'S HOUSE.

10:59.874 --> 11:02.026
NO! LOBSTER-MAN
WILL GET ME!

11:02.094 --> 11:04.878
OK, GOTTA PAY ATTENTION
HERE, BUD, OK?

11:06.664 --> 11:08.332
JUST SAID A SECOND AGO
THEY CAUGHT HIM.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.867
HE'S IN JAIL.
SO HE CAN'T GET YOU.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.218
I DON'T WANNA STAY
WITH YOU!

11:11.286 --> 11:13.220
YOU'LL TELL 'EM
THAT STUPID STORY AGAIN.

11:13.288 --> 11:15.923
UM, FOR
YOUR INFORMATION,

11:15.991 --> 11:19.760
MOST KIDS LOVE
THAT STUPID STORY. SO...

11:19.828 --> 11:21.728
MAYBE THE PROBLEM'S NOT WITH
THE STORY. MAYBE IT'S WITH YOU.

11:21.797 --> 11:22.913
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.981 --> 11:23.881
UNCLE DOUG'S
GOTTA GO NOW.

11:23.948 --> 11:25.148
AW, MAN. IT'S OK.
HE NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.

11:25.216 --> 11:26.250
NO, HE DOESN'T!
YES, HE DOES!

11:26.317 --> 11:28.001
YOU'RE SCARY!
I'M NOT SCARY!

11:28.069 --> 11:30.004
I'M YOUR GODFATHER, OK?
I DON'T CARE!

11:30.071 --> 11:32.090
OK, WELL, YOU'RE GONNA CARE WHEN
SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENS TO YOUR PARENTS

11:32.157 --> 11:33.457
AND I'M ALL YOU GOT!

11:34.492 --> 11:36.193
DADDY!
NO, DADDY'S GONNA BE FINE.

11:36.261 --> 11:37.962
GET OUT.

11:39.814 --> 11:41.982
BYE, BUDDY.
LOVE YOU, MAN!

11:50.958 --> 11:53.010
MR. JENKINS
WILL PICK YOU UP

11:53.077 --> 11:55.513
ON THE CORNER OF
NORTHERN AND THIRD.

11:58.099 --> 11:59.316
INCIDENTALLY,
HE SOUNDED

11:59.384 --> 12:03.220
A LITTLE SKETCHY ON THE PHONE,
SO KEEP THE DOOR UNLOCKED.

12:04.823 --> 12:06.023
HERE YOU GO, ARTHUR.

12:06.091 --> 12:08.092
THIS IS FOR
THE BROOKLYN RUN.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.144
OH, THANK YOU, FLORA.

12:10.212 --> 12:14.448
I HAVE A CLIENT GOING TO
YONKERS, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.649
OOH, YONKERS.

12:15.717 --> 12:17.485
OH, HOW DELIGHTFUL.

12:19.671 --> 12:21.138
BY THE BY,

12:21.206 --> 12:24.125
IT WOULDN'T HURT BUSINESS
IF YOU POPPED ANOTHER BUTTON.

12:28.079 --> 12:29.480
OOH.

12:32.717 --> 12:34.217
AND NOW, MAJOR
IS SO FREAKED OUT

12:34.285 --> 12:36.019
THAT SOMETHING COULD
HAPPEN TO ME OR DEACON,

12:36.087 --> 12:38.656
ONLY ONE OF US CAN LEAVE
THE APARTMENT AT A TIME.

12:38.723 --> 12:41.375
I'M SO SORRY.

12:41.443 --> 12:43.293
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOUR HUSBAND'S AN IDIOT.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.399
BELIEVE ME, IF HIS JOB
DIDN'T HAVE DENTAL,

12:48.466 --> 12:51.135
I WOULD'VE BEEN OUT THAT
DOOR A LONG TIME AGO.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.855
AND OUR TRIP
WAS NON-REFUNDABLE.

12:54.923 --> 12:56.189
WE'RE OUT 700 BUCKS.

12:56.258 --> 12:58.492
UNLESS WE CAN FIND SOMEBODY
TO TAKE IT OFF OUR HANDS.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.533
YOU ARE ON FIRE!

13:06.601 --> 13:07.885
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:07.953 --> 13:09.904
YOU SCARED THAT KID
SO BAD LAST NIGHT

13:09.971 --> 13:13.106
THAT DEACON AND KELLY
AREN'T GOING ON THEIR TRIP.

13:13.174 --> 13:14.758
BUT GUESS WHO IS?
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT-

13:14.793 --> 13:18.328
IT RHYMES
WITH SHMU AND SHMEE.

13:18.396 --> 13:21.014
WHOA! WE'RE NOT TAKING
THAT TRIP. I'M SORRY.

13:21.082 --> 13:22.132
NO, REALLY?

13:23.351 --> 13:25.285
THAT'S NOT
WHAT THESE TICKETS SAY.

13:26.622 --> 13:28.155
CARRIE, WE'RE NOT GOING.
WE'RE NOT GOING.

13:28.222 --> 13:31.875
DOUG, WE HAVE TO, HONEY,
FOR DEACON AND KELLY.

13:31.943 --> 13:33.911
OTHERWISE, THEY'RE GONNA
LOSE ALL THIS MONEY.

13:33.978 --> 13:36.813
THE TRIP IS
A PREPAID THING.

13:36.881 --> 13:37.998
OK. YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS PREPAID?

13:38.065 --> 13:40.167
YOUR TICKET TO HELL,
'CAUSE YOU'RE A DEVIL WOMAN.

13:42.153 --> 13:45.706
WELL, IF BY HELL, YOU
MEAN BERMUDA, THEN...

13:48.927 --> 13:50.243
NO, I GOTTA GO OVER THERE
AND MAKE THIS RIGHT.

13:50.312 --> 13:52.613
WHAT? DOUG, NO. STOP.

13:52.681 --> 13:53.948
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I'LL ADMIT,

13:54.016 --> 13:56.316
THE MORE YOU TORTURE THE KID,
THE BETTER THINGS GET FOR ME,

13:56.384 --> 13:59.553
BUT NOW I'M REALLY
THINKING OF MAJOR.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.055
YEAH, RIGHT.
I AM.

14:01.123 --> 14:02.556
DO YOU REALLY THINK GOING
OVER THERE FOR A THIRD TIME

14:02.624 --> 14:04.525
IS REALLY GONNA
MAKE THINGS BETTER?

14:05.510 --> 14:07.061
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE, YEAH.

14:07.129 --> 14:08.596
HONEY, LISTEN TO ME, OK?

14:08.663 --> 14:10.114
MAJOR LOVES YOU.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.199
BUT HE NEEDS A LITTLE
SPACE FROM YOU RIGHT NOW,

14:12.267 --> 14:13.667
A LITTLE TIME

14:13.735 --> 14:15.436
TO FORGET ABOUT ALL
THE SCARY STUFF YOU DID

14:15.504 --> 14:18.905
AND REMEMBER ALL THE GOOD TIMES
YOU GUYS HAVE HAD TOGETHER.

14:18.973 --> 14:19.924
HE NEVER REMEMBERS THOSE.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.625
I KNOW, I KNOW.

14:21.693 --> 14:23.894
I'M GONNA RUN SOME ERRANDS.
YOU GO TO THE DRY CLEANERS.

14:23.962 --> 14:25.329
AND WHEN YOU GET BACK,

14:25.397 --> 14:27.464
YOU CAN HAVE
A SCOOTER PIE.

14:27.532 --> 14:28.649
YEAH?

14:28.717 --> 14:30.651
I HAD ONE ALREADY,
BUT I'LL HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

14:36.241 --> 14:38.559
SIR, I ASSURE YOU
I HAD NO IDEA

14:38.626 --> 14:40.561
JOEL SUFFERED
FROM MOTION SICKNESS

14:40.628 --> 14:43.597
WHEN HE WAS HIRED
AT SHOTGUN ARTIE'S.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.266
FINE. WE'LL PAY
FOR YOUR CAR TO BE CLEANED.

14:47.703 --> 14:50.571
ARTHUR? THE CHECK
YOU WROTE ME BOUNCED.

14:50.638 --> 14:52.472
AS DID MINE.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.908
YOU KNOW HE'S PAYING US A LOUSY $10

14:54.976 --> 14:56.777
AND KEEPING 20
FOR HIMSELF?

14:56.845 --> 14:58.579
THAT'S AN OUTRAGEOUS LIE.

14:58.647 --> 14:59.813
I SAW THE BOOKS.

14:59.881 --> 15:01.716
THAT'S PRIVATE, AND
YOU'RE FIRED. NOW, BEAT IT.

15:01.783 --> 15:06.103
ARTHUR, YOU HAVE ME GOING ALL
THE WAY OUT TO PHILADELPHIA,

15:06.171 --> 15:08.455
BUT HOW AM I GOING
TO GET BACK?

15:08.523 --> 15:10.257
YOU HAVE A THUMB,
DON'T YOU?

15:11.109 --> 15:12.359
I'M A WOMAN.

15:12.427 --> 15:14.995
I CAN'T BE OUT THERE
ALONE AT NIGHT.

15:15.063 --> 15:18.649
TRUST ME
- NOBODY'S BUYING WHAT YOU'RE SELLING.

15:18.716 --> 15:19.599
OH!

15:20.835 --> 15:23.571
THESE WORK CONDITIONS
ARE TERRIBLE.

15:23.638 --> 15:25.038
I SAY WE FORM A UNION.

15:25.106 --> 15:26.440
YEAH!

15:26.508 --> 15:27.741
YOU SHOULD FORM
A UNION-

15:27.809 --> 15:29.643
A UNION OF INGRATES!

15:37.151 --> 15:39.687
<i>AND YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T TELL
HIM HIS PARENTS WILL DIE.</i>

15:39.754 --> 15:41.822
<i>I SAID IF THEY DIE.</i>

15:41.890 --> 15:44.058
YOU KNOW, HE'S THE ONE WHO
SAW THE GLASS HALF EMPTY.

15:44.126 --> 15:46.493
WELL, YOU KNOW, STUFF
LIKE THAT MAY SEEM SMALL,

15:46.561 --> 15:48.762
BUT IT COULD TRAUMATIZE
PEOPLE FOR YEARS.

15:48.830 --> 15:50.464
FOR YEARS.
YOU'RE CRAZY.

15:50.531 --> 15:51.832
EXCUSE ME?

15:51.900 --> 15:53.751
I'M NOT CRAZY, OK?

15:53.819 --> 15:55.386
I MEAN, YOU MAY NOT LIKE
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY,

15:55.454 --> 15:57.688
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MATTER ANYMORE.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.190
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

15:59.257 --> 16:02.726
BECAUSE I'VE LEARNED
FROM MY THERAPIST

16:02.794 --> 16:06.063
THAT THE ONLY OPINION
THAT MATTERS IS MINE.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.848
YEAH. ALL THESE YEARS,
I TRIED PLEASING

16:07.916 --> 16:10.451
MY FATHER,
MY TEACHERS, THE I.R.S.

16:10.518 --> 16:12.186
WELL, THAT'S OVER, OK?

16:12.254 --> 16:13.921
FROM NOW ON, IT'S ALL
ABOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?

16:13.989 --> 16:16.289
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 41 YEARS,

16:16.357 --> 16:18.909
DANNY HEFFERNAN IS
A VERY HAPPY GUY.

16:18.977 --> 16:20.560
YOU SEEM IT.

16:20.628 --> 16:22.229
I'LL BE IN THE CAR!

16:24.599 --> 16:27.101
ANOTHER PARTY TOMORROW,
MR. BIPPY?

16:27.168 --> 16:30.404
YEP. KIDS LOVE CLOWNS.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.148
HEY, BABE.

16:41.215 --> 16:42.315
WHAT THE-

16:47.138 --> 16:48.889
OH, MY GOD.

16:54.663 --> 16:57.798
YOU HAVE ME GOING ALL
THE WAY TO PHILADELPHIA.

16:57.866 --> 16:59.933
BUT HOW WILL I GET BACK?

17:00.001 --> 17:02.035
HOW WILL I GET BACK?

17:02.103 --> 17:05.372
ARTHUR, THE CHECK
YOU WROTE ME BOUNCED.

17:05.439 --> 17:06.373
I SAY
WE FORM A UNION.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.875
I SAY WE ROUGH HIM UP.

17:09.242 --> 17:11.560
LIFE WAS SO MUCH
SIMPLER LAST WEEK

17:11.628 --> 17:14.664
WHEN IT WAS JUST ME,
A STRANGER...

17:14.733 --> 17:17.434
AND THE OPEN ROAD.

17:20.538 --> 17:22.705
YOU GOING TO
THE EXPRESSWAY?

17:22.773 --> 17:24.958
UH, YEAH.

17:27.912 --> 17:31.165
HEY!

17:31.233 --> 17:32.349
DON'T WORRY.

17:32.416 --> 17:34.351
I'M DOING THIS ONE
FOR FREE.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.297
HELLO?

17:46.431 --> 17:48.282
HELLO. SORRY TO
BOTHER YOU THERE.

17:48.350 --> 17:49.683
I JUST MOVED
INTO THE BUILDING

17:49.751 --> 17:53.120
AND CAN'T SEEM TO REMEMBER
THE BLOODY ENTRY CODE.

17:53.188 --> 17:56.023
OH! WELL, WELCOME TO THE
BUILDING. UH, WHAT UNIT ARE YOU IN?

17:56.091 --> 17:57.691
OH, I'M IN 3-G.

17:57.759 --> 18:00.394
THE RANDALLS LIVE
IN 3-G.

18:00.461 --> 18:03.163
I'M SORRY, THAT'S 3-E.

18:03.231 --> 18:06.333
THAT'S "E"
AS IN ENTENMANN'S.

18:07.769 --> 18:09.136
DOUG.

18:09.204 --> 18:10.303
DEAC, COME ON,
LET ME IN!

18:10.371 --> 18:11.739
DOUG, GO HOME.

18:11.806 --> 18:13.640
COME ON, I GOT A COOL
SURPRISE FOR MAJOR!

18:13.708 --> 18:15.642
LEAVE MY KID ALONE!
DAMN!

18:39.017 --> 18:40.167
OOF!

18:51.246 --> 18:53.631
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

18:53.698 --> 18:55.582
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE!

19:01.906 --> 19:03.307
LISTEN, RONALD McDONALD.

19:03.374 --> 19:05.542
YOU ARE NOT SCREWING UP
THIS VACATION FOR ME,

19:05.609 --> 19:07.077
SO GET BACK DOWN HERE.

19:07.145 --> 19:08.646
NO!

19:14.468 --> 19:16.820
DAMN THESE GIGANTIC SHOES!

19:19.190 --> 19:21.224
DOUG, THIS
IS RIDICULOUS!

19:21.292 --> 19:22.193
NO! I KNOW I CAN
MAKE THIS RIGHT.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.428
DOUG, STOP!

19:24.496 --> 19:25.462
STOP.

19:27.098 --> 19:29.900
BABY, YOU GOTTA LET
THIS THING GO.

19:29.967 --> 19:32.269
NOT FOR ME,
NOT FOR THE TRIP,

19:32.337 --> 19:33.804
BUT FOR MAJOR.

19:36.741 --> 19:38.241
FINE.
GOOD, GOOD.

19:38.309 --> 19:40.911
NOW, COME ON, HONEY.
LET'S GO HOME.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.834
YOU ARE SO DEAD!

20:21.669 --> 20:23.754
SORRY I WAS
STARTLED AT FIRST.

20:23.821 --> 20:24.888
WHEN YOU GOT THE CAR,
I THOUGHT YOU HAD

20:24.955 --> 20:27.257
SOMETHING ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT IN MIND.

20:28.626 --> 20:31.078
OH, NO, NO.

20:31.146 --> 20:34.415
THAT IS A SERVICE
I DO NOT PROVIDE.

20:36.718 --> 20:39.452
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

20:39.520 --> 20:42.039
YOU'D PROBABLY MAKE
A FORTUNE.

20:42.106 --> 20:44.641
AHH. I BET I COULD.

20:46.728 --> 20:49.413
I BET I COULD.
