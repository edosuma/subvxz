WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:07.275
*

00:08.842 --> 00:10.444
MAN:
Yo, Alex.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.046
We're cool.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.081
Okay?
I know.

00:13.114 --> 00:13.481
For real.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.482
You made it.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.583
I don't know how,

00:15.616 --> 00:16.784
but you made it.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.352
So just relax.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.287
I'll feel better
when we're there.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.089
Look out the window.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.623
That's New Orleans, man.
You're here.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.225
Huh?

00:24.258 --> 00:26.560
Yeah. Okay.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.229
It's all po' boys and hurricanes
from now on, right?

00:28.262 --> 00:29.563
There's nothing to worry about.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.265
(tires squealing)

00:33.401 --> 00:35.269
(grunting)

00:59.793 --> 01:01.695
(gasps)

01:30.891 --> 01:33.461
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:33.494 --> 01:36.264
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:36.297 --> 01:38.566
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:38.599 --> 01:39.867
* How, how, how, how

01:39.900 --> 01:42.236
* Hey, hey

01:48.242 --> 01:49.410
* You gotta come on.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.814
Morning. Where is everyone?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.716
Tammy and Sonja are moving
into their new place today.

01:55.749 --> 01:56.917
LASALLE:
Where's Pride?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.353
Upstairs on a conference call
with the deputy director.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.922
Downloading on the Belle
Chasse forgery investigation.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.158
Showing D.C. that he could
color inside the lines.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.194
That's part of the deal
Pride made when he decided

02:06.227 --> 02:08.562
to take the team again
after the internal was done.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.199
Full postmortem
on every case.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.600
Yeah, a bunch
of bureaucratic BS.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.368
Hey, the forgery case
was straight up

02:14.402 --> 02:16.304
by the book, so we're good.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.272
It was a glorified
check fraud ring.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.607
It took less than
a day to clear.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.309
It's not exactly a
stress test to prove

02:21.342 --> 02:22.876
we won't bend
the rules anymore.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.646
Well, if Pride says we got
to toe the line from now on,

02:25.679 --> 02:27.448
hey, we'll toe the line.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.716
PATTON: Look, you know
he cares too much

02:28.749 --> 02:30.284
about his work to be handcuffed.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.885
Case gets complicated,

02:31.919 --> 02:33.587
he's gonna do whatever it takes.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.289
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, it's in his nature.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.458
It's classic scorpion
and frog scenario.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.327
You know, Scorpion promises
not to sting the frog

02:39.360 --> 02:41.195
if he takes him
across the river,

02:41.229 --> 02:43.264
but then the scorpion
can't help himself.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.298
Va, va-va, va.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.334
PRIDE:
Just to be clear...

02:46.367 --> 02:49.303
I'm a scorpion in this analogy?

02:49.337 --> 02:52.606
SEBASTIAN: Yes, but you are
a scorpion for justice,

02:52.640 --> 02:54.308
so...
Huh.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.777
Not sure how I feel about that.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.279
How'd the phone call go, King?

02:58.312 --> 03:00.314
Still got a job?
At the moment.

03:00.348 --> 03:02.316
Wait. What does that mean?
It's a joke, Patton.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.519
Call was cut short.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.289
NOPD divers just pulled a Navy
sailor out of the Mississippi.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.790
SEBASTIAN: Come on, you got
to give us more than that.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.292
We've been walking
on eggshells down here.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.693
PRIDE: There's nothing
to worry about.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.629
No one's taking my job. Okay?

03:16.564 --> 03:17.931
Now gear up,

03:17.965 --> 03:19.333
Frog.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.468
Let's learn things.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.673
(siren wailing)

03:25.706 --> 03:27.541
PRIDE:
Loretta.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.543
Dwayne.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.280
I heard you got a call from the
deputy director this morning.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.681
Not you, too, Loretta.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.449
Sure I don't know
what you mean.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.551
I had a call. It went fine.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.952
Good.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.020
Your words say good.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.722
Your tone says
something else.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.558
Why is everyone so
concerned about this call?

03:44.592 --> 03:48.362
Because for years you've run
your team your way.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.997
Suddenly, you have to answer
to the deputy director

03:50.030 --> 03:51.865
on every move you make?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.267
It's just temporary.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.602
If you say so.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.370
There's that tone again.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.772
Well, perhaps it's the
naturally inquisitive timbre

03:58.806 --> 04:01.342
of my voice.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.011
Why don't you just tell me
about our victim, Loretta?

04:04.044 --> 04:07.014
It's Yeoman First Class
Justin Winters.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.350
According to the
report, he was posted

04:09.383 --> 04:10.951
at the U.S. embassy in Berlin.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.020
Long way from Germany.
Cause of death?

04:13.053 --> 04:15.523
I'm guessing frontal
skull fracture,

04:15.556 --> 04:17.325
cardiac contusion.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.360
And at the very least,
he died instantly.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.295
Well, I don't see
any other vehicle.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.063
We looking at a hit
and run accident?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.532
Well, hit and run maybe,

04:24.565 --> 04:25.933
but this was no accident.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.401
We found some tire tracks.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.902
Based on the skid mark pattern
and the density,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.070
whoever hit Yeoman Winters

04:30.103 --> 04:31.939
was driving an SUV
at high speed.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.342
This was intentional.
Yeah, that's not all, King.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.809
You're gonna want to
take a look at the car.

04:38.912 --> 04:42.049
Driver's side was caved in,
sent the car over the guardrail

04:42.082 --> 04:44.084
and into the river.
SEBASTIAN:
Yeah, that explains the damage

04:44.117 --> 04:46.520
to the vehicle, except for this.

04:46.554 --> 04:49.390
Rear passenger window
was busted,

04:49.423 --> 04:50.458
but from the inside.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.926
And Winters was dead on impact.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.728
Someone else was in the car.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.996
SEBASTIAN:
And managed to escape.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.366
Yeah, but even if someone were
able to break out of the car,

04:58.399 --> 05:00.067
chances are they'd be
swept away in the current.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.436
Well, unless we're not talking
about an ordinary person.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.004
Check out that front tire.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.841
Someone cut the air valve.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.710
SEBASTIAN:
And I'm thinking they

05:09.743 --> 05:11.645
used it as a makeshift
breathing apparatus,

05:11.679 --> 05:14.014
just like Roger Moore
in View to a Kill.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.017
You suggesting we're looking
for James Bond here, Sebastian?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.952
A boy can dream.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.854
(chuckles) Well, the Mississippi
is cold and treacherous.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.591
Why would someone want to stay
underwater long enough

05:23.624 --> 05:25.393
to need extra oxygen?

05:25.426 --> 05:27.928
Because something on the bank
was more dangerous.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.998
LASALLE:
Whoever ran Winters' car
off the road waited

05:31.031 --> 05:32.666
to make sure there were
no survivors.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.003
All right. Process the car.
Call Sonja and Gregorio,

05:36.036 --> 05:38.439
have them pull surveillance.
Christopher, get with NOPD.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.442
If the passenger did survive,
we need to find him

05:41.475 --> 05:43.477
and Yeoman Winters' killer.
You got it.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.648
We getting a new couch?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.383
No, the one I have is fine.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.118
It sucks that Pride had to pull
you guys away on moving day.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.987
Sorry. But, uh, on the other
hand, when he gets here,

05:54.021 --> 05:56.123
do not ask him about
that phone call to HQ, okay?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.525
It's kind of a
sensitive subject.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.992
Was it that bad?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.661
He claims it was fine.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.130
Fine as in fine?
Or fine as in screwed?

06:03.163 --> 06:05.999
I think more fine as in
mind your own business.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.035
Okay.
And so we should.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.937
I pulled surveillance video

06:09.970 --> 06:12.840
in a two-mile radius
of the crash site.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.008
This is from the
Coast Guard river cam

06:15.042 --> 06:17.110
a few minutes
after the collision.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.950
Okay, so this man swam
clear across the river.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.084
Doesn't stop there.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.091
These are some Spider-Man moves.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.092
Well, actually, I thought it
was more like a James Bond

06:32.125 --> 06:33.694
kind of vibe, but really
it's dealer's choice.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.895
Okay. Whoever it is,

06:34.928 --> 06:36.830
training like that
could be military.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.499
And he's clearly on
the run, but from what?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.534
Yeah, well,
based on the tire tracks,

06:40.568 --> 06:43.604
we know that an SUV ran Winters'
car into the river.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.038
Lasalle's with NOPD
right now trying to find

06:45.072 --> 06:47.174
the missing vehicle and
whoever was driving it.

06:47.207 --> 06:51.445
So, unidentified victim
and unidentified suspect.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.913
Yeah, and we have no idea where
either of them ran off to,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.214
so really we're in great shape.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.716
I may not be able to tell you
where he went,

06:55.749 --> 06:56.950
but I know where
he came from.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.552
I pulled the GPS off
of Winters' vehicle.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.057
Okay, so what? He left
Fort Lauderdale last night

07:04.091 --> 07:06.026
and drove straight through
to New Orleans?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.495
GREGORIO:
And took the back roads
the entire route.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.996
Trying hard not to be seen.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.831
Someone knew exactly
where he'd be.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.099
They ran him
into the river.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.166
Yeah, 'cause we weren't
the only ones

07:13.200 --> 07:14.802
monitoring his movements.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.104
I found a digital bug
in his GPS.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.639
Now, it went out when Winters
hit the water,

07:18.672 --> 07:20.474
but someone was tracking his car
the whole way.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.742
Can you back-trace the bug?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.777
I'm a little hurt
you even had to ask.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.816
The signal's coming
from Celeste Street.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.017
Old industrial building.
I'll call Pride.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.525
Patton says the signal's
still active,

07:37.558 --> 07:39.092
coming from somewhere
inside the building.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.260
Gregorio and I
will take the front.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.595
We'll cover the back.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.996
PRIDE:
Eyes open.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.832
We don't know who
or how many are in there.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.653
Got something.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.555
River side of the second floor.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.089
I'm moving in.
PRIDE: I'm on my way.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.827
(gun cocks)

08:13.861 --> 08:16.229
BOTH:
Federal agent, drop your weapon.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.065
I don't care who you are;
you better lower that weapon.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.733
You first.
Not gonna happen.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.034
Gregorio.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.836
She claims she's a fed, Pride.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.238
I am a fed.
Who's pointing a gun at me.

08:25.272 --> 08:26.173
You're pointing a gun at me.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.775
We'll figure this out

08:27.808 --> 08:29.677
after you lower your weapon.
ISLER: Pride.

08:29.710 --> 08:33.080
Gregorio. It's all right.
It's all right.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.916
Special Agent Sarah Barns.
She's with me.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.686
Isler, what the hell
are you doing here?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.888
Good question.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.103
GREGORIO:
Sonja and Sebastian
are going back to NCIS.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.005
They'll keep searching
for our missing passenger.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.941
Good. Fewer people that know
we're here, the better.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.876
Yeah, well, I'm still waiting
for an explanation

09:02.910 --> 09:04.344
as to why you're here.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.814
Afraid that's classified.
GREGORIO: Got a dead Navy sailor

09:06.847 --> 09:08.816
who's being tracked by the FBI.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.884
I think we're way past
classified.
It's okay, Barns.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.986
We had a good reason
for tracking your sailor.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.888
Winters worked at the
U.S. embassy in Berlin.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.123
He struck up a friendship

09:16.156 --> 09:17.891
with his counterpart
at the Russian embassy.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.192
Alexander Petrov.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.863
This is our missing passenger.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.798
A few days ago, Alexander
approached Winters,

09:24.832 --> 09:27.134
said he had valuable intel,
wanted to come in.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.002
Winters contacted
counterintelligence,

09:29.036 --> 09:30.638
landed on my desk.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.806
Alexander would only hand
the intel over

09:32.840 --> 09:34.107
if Winters brought him in.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.309
And only in New Orleans
for some reason.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.046
So you ran a
counterintelligence operation

09:39.079 --> 09:41.682
with a sailor in my backyard.

09:42.716 --> 09:43.984
Did you lose my phone number?

09:44.017 --> 09:44.918
BARNS:
The intel we're talking about

09:44.952 --> 09:47.154
is way too explosive
to open the circle.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.288
Isler.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.758
Alexander had a list

09:50.791 --> 09:54.027
of every covert Russian agent
operating in the U.S.,

09:54.061 --> 09:55.763
including the government.

09:55.796 --> 09:56.930
BARNS:
No one can be trusted.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.199
I knew we had to go off book;

09:59.232 --> 10:00.934
Isler agreed.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.235
PRIDE:
Well, well.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.305
Look who's gone rogue.
Nope.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.874
I made a calculated decision

10:06.907 --> 10:08.308
to proceed with
the utmost caution.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.977
Potato, potahto.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.178
Doesn't matter anyway.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.013
The operation failed.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.347
No.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.316
Alexander's still alive.

10:16.349 --> 10:17.818
He wanted to come
to New Orleans,

10:17.851 --> 10:19.753
he must've had a reason.

10:19.787 --> 10:23.290
And we can still find him
and your list.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.726
If you're offering to help,
it's got to be off book, too.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.394
You can't alert your superiors.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.862
Well, that's kind of
gonna be a problem.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.130
We're sort of
on a short leash

10:30.163 --> 10:32.332
these days.
Gregorio, it's fine.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.935
What, did something happen?
No, he just doesn't like

10:34.968 --> 10:35.936
to talk about it.
Gregorio.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.905
Sorry.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.709
Okay.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.910
We'll work off
book with you

10:42.943 --> 10:44.011
for now, Raymond.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.713
But you need to behave

10:45.746 --> 10:47.781
and follow the rules.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.718
Pride.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.219
You're enjoying

10:52.252 --> 10:54.154
this little role reversal,
aren't you?

10:54.187 --> 10:57.090
Now that you mention it.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.258
(chuckles)

11:01.094 --> 11:03.831
Alexander Petrov
was born and raised

11:03.864 --> 11:05.933
outside Saint Petersburg.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.969
Trained for the Olympics
in both swimming and gymnastics,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.138
he abruptly gave up
his spot on 2008 team

11:11.171 --> 11:14.842
when he was conscripted
into the army.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.443
It's amazing.
I know, right?

11:18.812 --> 11:21.481
Ostensibly doing clerical
work for various embassies.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.417
But we believe
that's his official cover.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.086
In fact,

11:26.119 --> 11:28.388
he's a covert
operative for the GRU.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.926
Any questions?
LASALLE:
Yeah, the suit.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.196
Does... the FBI send you all
to the same store?

11:36.229 --> 11:38.899
I... mean,
they give us guidelines.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.968
Yeah, but you're
from New York, right?
New Jersey.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.837
Isler's got a type.
Bam.
I'm sorry,

11:43.871 --> 11:45.105
what does this have to do
with Alexander Petrov?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.974
Nothing.
More about how you're

11:47.007 --> 11:49.076
the spitting image of Gregorio

11:49.109 --> 11:52.279
before she joined NCIS.
I don't understand.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.481
Well, I mean, it's not, like,
a exact replica, you know.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.850
More like a new model,
Kind of like Tammy 2.0.

11:56.884 --> 11:57.985
LASALLE: Yeah, hair's
definitely different.

11:58.018 --> 11:58.986
Oh, it's
totally different.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.020
It's the part.
Okay, okay,

12:00.053 --> 12:01.354
okay, we've got a highly trained

12:01.388 --> 12:02.856
Russian operative
loose in the city.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.457
We should be talking
about how to find him.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.759
Not my haircut.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.927
PATTON:
Why can't we do both?

12:06.960 --> 12:07.861
I've been scanning surveillance

12:07.895 --> 12:09.396
throughout the city.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.031
I think I found our man again.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.937
He made a phone call?
Short one.
Maybe, like, 30 seconds.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.872
But then he fell
off the grid again.

12:18.906 --> 12:19.973
Any idea who he called?

12:20.007 --> 12:21.274
An online voice box.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.375
He didn't leave
a message.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.443
He just stood
there silently,

12:23.476 --> 12:24.978
then he hung up.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.914
But I was able to get
the name of the person

12:26.947 --> 12:28.015
who it was registered to,
though.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.519
Eveline Casey?

12:32.552 --> 12:33.987
Yeah, an old alias

12:34.021 --> 12:35.889
for someone
we know all too well.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.066
Who's Eva Azarova?

12:46.099 --> 12:48.001
Badass former
Russian sleeper agent.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.502
We worked with her before.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.471
And against her
a couple of times.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.473
Any idea where
she is now?

12:53.506 --> 12:55.208
Oh, yeah.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.412
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

13:04.451 --> 13:06.820
Special Agent Pride.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.956
You know, most
of my visitors

13:08.989 --> 13:11.024
bring gifts, but you...

13:11.058 --> 13:13.026
you brought a man.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.129
Deputy Director Isler. FBI.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.031
I'd shake your hand, but...

13:20.000 --> 13:21.902
You get a lot of visitors, Eva?
Sure.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.872
CIA, NSA, DIA.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.539
They bring me food

13:26.573 --> 13:28.141
and creature comforts,

13:28.175 --> 13:30.978
wild promises
of a shortened sentence.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.213
For my help in return.
We need

13:33.246 --> 13:36.383
your help, too.
Well, then I'll tell you
what I told them.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.584
I'm out of the game.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.120
No more cloak
and dagger.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.521
I'm retired.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.890
We're not asking.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.357
You wi cooperate.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.359
Because,
as bad as this place is,

13:46.393 --> 13:49.897
there are far darker holes that
we could stick you in, lady.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.632
I've been practicing
transcendental meditation.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.502
I've found
inner peace.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.605
The size of my cage
won't change that.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.639
I get it, Eva.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.041
You moved on.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.110
But I'm not just any fed
coming to talk.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.544
We have history.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.046
Frankly,

14:06.079 --> 14:08.281
after the trouble
you've caused in the past,

14:08.315 --> 14:10.583
you owe me one.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.354
Alexander Petrov.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.290
He came to New Orleans
to defect.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.926
Almost got killed.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.128
Made one phone call
before disappearing,

14:21.161 --> 14:23.897
to your voice mail.
Oh, see, I haven't checked
my messages

14:23.931 --> 14:25.933
in, like,
eight to 12 months, so...

14:25.966 --> 14:27.134
Come on, Eva.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.236
How do you know Alexander?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.007
We trained together.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.644
Well, can you tell us
where to find him?
Nope.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.013
I could show you--
if you put me in the field.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.648
What happened to being retired?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.051
Like you said,
I owe you one. Right?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.453
Look, Alexander's
the best the GRU has.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.988
He's better than me.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.557
If he's on the run, you
won't catch him, but...

14:50.590 --> 14:52.225
he trusts me.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.260
Yeah?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.931
I'm not sure that I do, though.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.099
You going?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.533
I am.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.235
Have a great
life, Eva.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.236
ISLER:
Pride.

15:03.270 --> 15:07.040
Hey. Let's get her out.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.209
I said follow the rules
and behave.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.944
Putting her
on the street

15:10.978 --> 15:12.079
is not behaving

15:12.112 --> 15:13.013
and not worth the hassle.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.015
Do you want to solve
your sailor's murder?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.249
You want to bring in

15:16.283 --> 15:17.450
the most important
Russian defector

15:17.484 --> 15:18.451
in almost two decades?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.553
Do you want to bring down
their entire network

15:20.587 --> 15:21.721
in the U.S.?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.991
No, we got to color
outside the lines.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.060
You're doing it again.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.128
What?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.230
Sounding like me.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.132
That's not a no.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.636
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

15:36.669 --> 15:38.371
GREGORIO:
Okay, so, wait,

15:38.405 --> 15:40.373
we're sending in one
deadly Russian operative

15:40.407 --> 15:42.442
to collect another
deadly Russian operative?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.044
That's the plan.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.378
I don't like it--
it's too risky.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.713
Well, we don't have a choice.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.248
Eva says Alexander
won't come in

15:48.281 --> 15:50.017
unless he sees
someone he trusts.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.552
Uh, Eva says
a lot of things.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.554
He'll have an agent with
him the entire time

15:54.587 --> 15:57.190
and a backup team moments
away monitoring every step.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.759
Well, we all know what Eva
can be like in moments.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.429
Last time we did this,
she stabbed a guy.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.764
Yeah. But she hated him.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.534
Seems to have affection
for Alexander.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.602
Affection? What do you mean?
ISLER:
Skip back.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.738
Back up to the part where
Eva stabb someone.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.374
This was your idea.
And I stand by it.

16:14.407 --> 16:17.144
But we should frisk her
again, just to be safe.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.313
Are we gonna draw straws to see
who rides with the assassin?

16:20.347 --> 16:21.748
I'll do it.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.250
That was fast.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.484
We have a working
relationship.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.186
I just, I know
what to expect.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.988
After you.
Thank you, Roy.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.393
I told you
we'd see each other again.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.765
If this is your way
of apologizing

16:38.798 --> 16:42.335
for not visiting me
in prison, I accept.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.374
Clear.
Sonja and Lasalle

16:47.407 --> 16:49.676
will be on your six
the whole time.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.044
You go in,
you get Alexander...

16:51.078 --> 16:52.345
SONJA:
And we're bringing you

16:52.379 --> 16:54.547
right back to NCIS.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.385
Let's go.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.189
Who's driving?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.235
LASALLE:
Just remember, Gregorio,
if things go sideways,

17:15.268 --> 17:18.171
we're right behind you.
Copy that, Lasalle. I'm good.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.109
You look good.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.144
Don't.
I'm just saying...

17:24.177 --> 17:25.112
Just stop
right there.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.180
We're not here to, like,
hang out

17:27.214 --> 17:28.348
or catch up or flirt.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.217
We're here to do a job,
and that's it.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.252
EVA:
Okay. But admit it,

17:32.285 --> 17:34.554
you wanted some alone time--
that's why you volunteered.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.390
No, I volunteered because I know
you and I'm hip to your tricks.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.092
Not all of them.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.761
You buying Gregorio's
explanation here?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.763
'Cause I'm not convinced.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.233
Yeah. Well, I take my friends
at their word, so...

17:46.266 --> 17:49.068
What's that supposed to mean?

17:50.437 --> 17:51.671
Doesn't matter.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.672
GREGORIO:
We're stopping here.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.706
Frenchman Street.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.841
SONJA:
Copy that.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.109
We've got eyes on you.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.813
This is our place.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.482
Got a safe house
above Bamboula's.
Okay.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.184
LASALLE:
All right, careful, Tammy.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.520
Last time we were here, we found
four dead Russians inside.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.657
Not very safe.
It's the only place Alexander
knows where to meet us.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.159
All right, let's go.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.260
You forgetting something?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.527
No way.
I can't go in there

18:14.561 --> 18:16.329
like this, looking
like a prisoner.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.097
He'll be spooked.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.369
You try anything,
I'll break your jaw.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.638
I've missed this.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.412
* Never treat me very good

18:32.445 --> 18:33.880
* Why don't you tell me
why I should *

18:33.913 --> 18:36.616
* Hang around with you

18:36.649 --> 18:37.917
* I'm so lonesome...

18:37.950 --> 18:40.220
This is a strange place
for a safe house.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.854
They take cash,
no questions asked.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.157
Keys, please.
Thanks.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.892
And bartenders make
great lookouts.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.827
Plus, I like the music.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.463
* I don't want a man
to tease me *

18:50.497 --> 18:52.932
* Then leave me all alone...

18:52.965 --> 18:55.602
(song continues in distance)

18:55.635 --> 18:57.304
Wait.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.710
* Send me roses to my door

19:03.743 --> 19:06.213
* Instead I'm crying
on the floor *

19:06.246 --> 19:08.315
* Just thinking about you.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.217
NCIS! Drop the knife.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.251
Now!
Sasha. Sasha.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.220
(speaking Russian)

19:13.786 --> 19:14.754
(speaking Russian)

19:14.787 --> 19:17.557
English. English, okay?
Of course.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.958
I'm gonna need you
to put that knife down.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.593
Sorry. Habit.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.230
Alexander Petrov, I'm
Special Agent Gregorio.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.664
We're bringing you in now.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.866
Don't worry, it's okay.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.536
Lasalle, Sonja, we've
made contact with Alexander.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.771
We're moving out.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.774
Lasalle, Sonja, do you read me?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.246
Eva, what are you doing?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.480
Do you hear that?

19:41.914 --> 19:43.683
No more music.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.918
Stay here.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.955
Guys, we got trouble up here.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.390
Do you copy?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.932
(grunting)

20:33.300 --> 20:36.936
(Eva and Gregorio panting)

20:46.012 --> 20:48.281
LASALLE:
Gregorio?

20:51.418 --> 20:52.919
You okay?

20:52.952 --> 20:54.287
Where the hell were you guys?

20:54.321 --> 20:55.988
Someone took out
our comm system.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.056
Where's Alexander?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.958
In the bathroom.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.334
Not anymore.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.550
This was supposed to be simple.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.851
Get in, grab Alexander, get out,

21:24.884 --> 21:26.553
and somehow you still
screwed it up.

21:26.586 --> 21:29.656
You're blaming us?
I'm blaming Eva,

21:29.689 --> 21:32.058
because her Russian colleagues
knew every move we were making.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.394
First of all, they're not
her colleagues. Secondly,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.996
Eva's been in federal prison
for the past eight months.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.898
How would she contact them?
You said it

21:38.931 --> 21:41.501
yourself--
she's tricky.
The Russians
have been tracking us

21:41.534 --> 21:43.836
ever since Yeoman Winters
arrived. Now, however

21:43.870 --> 21:45.405
they're doing it
doesn't change the fact

21:45.438 --> 21:46.673
that our defector
is still in the wind.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.576
And your quiet operation
just got a lot louder.

21:49.609 --> 21:53.713
NOPD wants an explanation about
what went down at that bar.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.483
Not to mention Deputy
Director of NCIS.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.084
ISLER:
I'll deal with D.C.,
make it clear

21:58.117 --> 21:59.686
that I'm responsible
for everything.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.488
Still doesn't help us
find Alexander.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.590
Sonja and Sebastian are
at Frenchman Street

22:03.623 --> 22:05.692
pulling forensics
and surveillance.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.395
If Alexander left a
trail, they'll find it.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.663
That leaves
the two GRU agents.
GREGORIO:
Lasalle's at Mercy Hospital

22:10.697 --> 22:12.899
waiting for the operative
to wake up. Pretty sure

22:12.932 --> 22:15.535
I fractured his skull.
BARNS:
The other operative
is in interrogation.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.570
I'll question her.

22:17.604 --> 22:20.607
Well, this may be your case,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.609
but Yeoman Winters
is my dead sailor.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.577
And those operatives
attacked one of my agents.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.382
You can wait your turn.

22:32.619 --> 22:36.055
According to your ID,
your name is Callie Tillford.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.524
25-year-old graduate student

22:37.557 --> 22:39.559
from the University
of Tennessee.

22:39.592 --> 22:42.929
Go Vols.
But you're actually
a GRU sleeper

22:42.962 --> 22:44.531
sent here to New Orleans

22:44.564 --> 22:46.599
to take out one of your own--
Alexander Petrov.

22:46.633 --> 22:47.767
I'm not gonna

22:47.800 --> 22:50.403
waste your time here,
so please...

22:50.437 --> 22:51.671
don't waste mine.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.406
Eva Azarova told us everything.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.675
Alexander's a top spy.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.512
And you believe her?
You saying Alex isn't a spy?

22:59.546 --> 23:01.414
Eva knows
what she's talking about.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.816
She's a former sleeper agent.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.785
No such thing as a former agent.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.154
Yeah, how would a graduate
student know about that?

23:08.187 --> 23:11.057
You and your partner knew how
to find my people at that bar.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.825
I can only assume it was you

23:12.859 --> 23:15.161
who attacked
Yeoman Winters yesterday.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.996
How are you tracking us?

23:17.029 --> 23:18.831
You know
I'm not gonna answer that.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.667
You killed a Navy sailor

23:20.700 --> 23:22.769
and tried to kill
an NCIS agent.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.537
If you don't cooperate,

23:24.571 --> 23:27.507
you will be spending the rest
of your life in prison.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.176
Well, there are worse things.
You're a hired killer.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.644
You think you're being loyal

23:31.678 --> 23:32.779
to some sort
of a greater cause here?

23:32.812 --> 23:34.180
Let me ask
you something.

23:34.213 --> 23:37.550
If you sent agents
thousands of miles away

23:37.584 --> 23:39.686
to live in a foreign
country and do

23:39.719 --> 23:43.790
unspeakable things, would you
control them with a cause?

23:43.823 --> 23:45.825
No, I'd use leverage.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.994
They have your family?

23:48.027 --> 23:50.763
No, not me, Agent Pride.

23:50.797 --> 23:54.634
I'm a graduate student
from Tennessee.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.102
But like I said,

23:56.135 --> 23:58.838
there's no such thing
as a former agent.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.142
(Sonja sighs)

24:03.175 --> 24:05.612
Sebastian and I scoured
Frenchman Street

24:05.645 --> 24:07.046
and the surrounding areas.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.515
No sign of Alexander.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.949
But we did find
the Russians' SUV

24:09.982 --> 24:11.618
parked a few
blocks away.

24:11.651 --> 24:12.785
Dented front bumper.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.053
Same one they used
to kill Winters.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.523
Anything inside?
Ooh, thank you. Nothing but

24:16.556 --> 24:17.957
an encrypted phone.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.692
Sebastian and Patton are
trying to hack it now.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.561
Any luck interrogating
the operatives?

24:21.594 --> 24:24.263
Dude finally woke up at the
hospital. He didn't say a word.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.599
Don't know about
his partner.
Just finished talking to her.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.267
Wouldn't say much,
either, except

24:28.300 --> 24:30.503
Eva's holding back on us.

24:30.537 --> 24:31.771
You can't think Eva's
working with them.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.139
I mean, she saved my life today.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.874
That doesn't mean a thing.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.609
Eva's always had her own agenda.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.077
What makes this case
any different?
No.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.879
She's definitely not
tipping off the Russians.

24:39.912 --> 24:42.114
Can you honestly tell me you
think she's being above board?

24:42.148 --> 24:45.885
Why don't you let
me talk to her?
That's a bad idea.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.920
We have a connection,
and she trusts me.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.557
Or she's using you.
It's sort of her thing.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.791
Listen, I'm not a pushover.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.126
And we don't have
a lot of options.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.596
Or time. As soon as Isler
and Barns are finished

24:56.629 --> 25:00.633
with Callie, they're gonna
want to question Eva, too.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.201
(sighs)

25:04.336 --> 25:07.206
Okay, Gregorio, go for it.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.975
Okay, but not here.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.711
I feel like I need to make her
feel a little more comfortable.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.989
Sorry about the mess.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.091
Sonja and I just
moved in today.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.926
You live together?

25:26.959 --> 25:29.662
Yeah, we're just
roommates.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.698
Are those bullet holes?

25:31.731 --> 25:33.700
Oh. Damn it!

25:33.733 --> 25:35.702
Landlord told us
that he'd get these patched up

25:35.735 --> 25:37.637
before we moved in.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.972
We like a place with character.

25:40.006 --> 25:43.576
Aren't you afraid
I might try something?

25:43.610 --> 25:44.611
You better not.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.715
Hey, why don't you go

25:48.748 --> 25:50.016
in the back room?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.084
I'm gonna talk to her
for a second.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.126
All right.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.595
What?
What are you doing?

26:02.629 --> 26:04.997
Interrogating the witness.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.999
Is wine some kind
of secret FBI tactic

26:07.033 --> 26:08.635
I don't know anything about?

26:08.668 --> 26:09.869
(quietly):
I told you.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.604
I need to make her comfortable.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.841
Yes, but not too comfortable.

26:14.874 --> 26:17.209
Oh, stop.
You stop.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.846
You just got to...
(clicks tongue)

26:19.879 --> 26:22.081
(clicks tongue)
Keep it professional.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.316
The most professional.
I got this.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.227
What is this? You take me
into your bedroom

26:35.261 --> 26:36.729
and you get me tipsy on wine,

26:36.763 --> 26:38.731
and I-- what-- I
reveal all my secrets?

26:38.765 --> 26:40.733
That's the general idea.
Okay.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.368
Pride thinks you're
holding back on us.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.136
What do you think?

26:44.170 --> 26:47.339
I know you're holding back.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.777
The way you hugged Alexander--
it wasn't just a colleague.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.411
You guys have history.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.280
Jealous?
This is not a joke.

26:54.313 --> 26:57.750
Whoever he is to you,
he's in real danger,

26:57.784 --> 27:00.119
so you need
to be honest with me.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.997
Alexander's my brother.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.199
He's not GRU.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.669
He's an athlete
and an army clerk that

27:16.703 --> 27:18.838
has the bad luck
of being related to me.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.406
We're gonna help Alexander.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.208
No, you're not.
You're gonna use him.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.877
You're gonna use him for
the intel that he smuggled in,

27:24.911 --> 27:27.379
and then, you're gonna
lock him up, just like me.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.382
Okay, so he's out there
somewhere hiding...
Mm-hmm.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.018
...waiting for you.
Mm-hmm.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.386
Let me ask you
a question.
Yeah.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.422
How'd you plan
on getting out of here?

27:36.455 --> 27:39.759
Were you gonna
fight your way out?

27:39.792 --> 27:41.994
No, I thought I'd seduce you.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.429
Oh, I'm not
that easy, baby.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.767
Look, I am the only person
in the world

27:47.800 --> 27:49.401
that Sasha can trust,

27:49.435 --> 27:52.805
and he's the only person
that I can trust.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.477
All right, so...

27:58.510 --> 28:00.079
let's say
you did get out of here,

28:00.112 --> 28:03.282
elude me, NCIS, FBI...

28:05.217 --> 28:07.754
Where would you go?

28:08.988 --> 28:10.823
Honestly?
Yeah.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.059
Montana.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.095
All that open space,
mountains and horses.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.429
You want to be a cowgirl?

28:18.530 --> 28:21.133
I want to be free.

28:22.534 --> 28:26.072
Yeah, you were wrong
about one thing.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.374
Alexander's not the only one
who has your back.

28:28.407 --> 28:32.178
Oh, yeah? What, you
have my back, too?
No doubt.

28:32.211 --> 28:36.082
That's why you're gonna
tell me where he went.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.387
PATTON:
Oh, yeah.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.956
We did it. Don't know how,

28:43.990 --> 28:46.025
and it took us half the night,
but we did it.
SEBASTIAN: It's exhilarating.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.194
Must be how Hillary felt when
he peaked Everest, but with,

28:48.227 --> 28:50.429
you know, less frostbite.
Well, what exactly
did you do?

28:50.462 --> 28:53.265
We broke the encryption
on the Russians' phone.
Yeah, we found a text chain.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.967
LASALLE:
Any idea who from?

28:55.001 --> 28:56.502
No way to back-trace the source.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.470
Whoever it is, though, knows
every move we've been making.

28:58.504 --> 28:59.438
And that's not all we found.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.340
Yeah, somebody else
was on this text chain.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.508
Our operatives
are not working alone.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.343
There's another hit team
out there.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.444
Alexander still has
a target on his back.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.246
Yeah, not just him.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.081
If they knew that we were going
to the safe house, then

29:09.115 --> 29:11.250
they'd probably know that Eva's
with us. She's in danger, too.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.385
We need to get her
back here to NCIS.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.257
Got it, Lasalle.
I will grab Gregorio and Eva,

29:18.290 --> 29:20.960
and, uh, we're coming right in.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.562
Don't mean to disturb whatever
it is you're doing in there,

29:23.595 --> 29:26.198
but we need to head back
to NCIS.

29:26.232 --> 29:27.566
Hey, ladies?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.301
We need to go now.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.137
There's another hit squad
out there.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.505
I'm coming in.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.509
(sighs)

29:37.543 --> 29:41.413
Oh, man, this is not good.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.428
You allowed Gregorio
to take our federal prisoner,

29:56.462 --> 29:58.564
who is a former Russian spy, to
her apartment for questioning,

29:58.597 --> 30:01.133
and now they're gone?
It was a judgment call.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.402
It was a bad one.
Gregorio can handle herself.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.571
If she went with Eva,
she's got reasons.

30:05.604 --> 30:08.174
Or she was compromised.
There is a relationship there.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.142
Maybe Eva turned her.
SONJA:
No way.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.178
Look, I don't know why
Gregorio did this,

30:12.211 --> 30:14.113
but she didn't turn,
right, Pride?

30:14.146 --> 30:18.150
I'll ask her myself. NOPD just
located Gregorio's car.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.119
You put out a BOLO
without consulting me?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.553
I don't know how they
do business down here,

30:21.587 --> 30:23.622
but I'm following protocol.

30:23.655 --> 30:27.526
Their agent went off the grid
with our asset. I'll find them.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.097
SONJA:
Mm.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.966
You're not saying anything.
We need to stop her.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.968
She's doing her job.
Well, if this is

30:36.002 --> 30:39.872
you trying to stay inside
the lines, I got a news flash.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.640
We're way outside right now.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.076
Focus on what we
can deal with.

30:44.110 --> 30:47.980
Alexander's still in the wind
with a hit team on his trail,

30:48.014 --> 30:49.916
who seem to know
every move we make.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.885
Get with the rest of the team,
see what they know.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.121
(scoffs)

31:01.060 --> 31:02.661
What is it, Raymond?

31:02.694 --> 31:04.530
You got an angle.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.498
I don't know what it is,

31:06.532 --> 31:08.367
but you've definitely got one.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.607
Hey, I think I got a bead
on our hit team.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.077
Russian nationals just
landed at the airport.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.146
Tattoos look like
they're Special Forces.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.248
That's great. But I got
to catch up with Barns.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.250
She put a BOLO out
on Gregorio.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.318
Yeah, that's
what I would have done.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.387
Treat Gregorio like a fugitive?

31:28.420 --> 31:29.555
Of course not.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.590
But what if Eva
took her hostage?

31:31.623 --> 31:33.192
Gregorio trusts Eva.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.194
Don't know why, but
I trust Gregorio.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.964
You can give up on her--
I'm stopping Barns.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.231
Hey, I'm not giving up.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.632
I'm just trying
to keep her

31:40.666 --> 31:42.301
from getting killed
by these guys.

31:42.334 --> 31:43.469
What's your problem?

31:43.502 --> 31:44.570
My problem...

31:44.603 --> 31:46.272
is when you take
someone's side,

31:46.305 --> 31:48.407
you stick with them
no matter what.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.277
You don't just drop them
when things get complicated.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.146
We still, uh, talking
about Gregorio here?

31:54.180 --> 31:56.148
Who else would I
be talking about?

31:56.182 --> 31:58.484
Well, we're not dropping anyone.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.153
All right? We're focusing
on doing what we can

32:01.187 --> 32:02.654
for the greater good,

32:02.688 --> 32:04.590
no matter what
our personal feelings are.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.425
Are you still talking
about Gregorio?

32:06.458 --> 32:07.593
Of course.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.661
Am I interrupting something?

32:09.695 --> 32:10.662
Yep.
No.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.098
All right, well,
this can't wait.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.300
I've been trying
to locate Tammy's phone,

32:14.333 --> 32:15.968
but it's off--
I have no idea where she is.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.636
I was able to pull
her calling history.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.271
She made one call last night

32:19.305 --> 32:20.506
before she went dark.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.142
To Pride.

32:25.411 --> 32:28.114
*

32:28.147 --> 32:32.284
EVA:
Alexander had a passion
for American amusement parks.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.120
Nothing in Russia
really compares.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.122
And I sent
this NOLA Funland coin to him

32:36.155 --> 32:37.289
when I first moved here.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.091
Funland's been shut down
for years.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.493
Perfect place to lay low.
Perfect place

32:41.527 --> 32:42.995
for an ambush, too.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.206
Kind of wishing your brother

32:54.240 --> 32:56.408
had a thing
for five-star hotels right now.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.544
And I'd be more comfortable
if you'd given me a weapon.

32:58.577 --> 32:59.745
Yeah, well, I know we're
tight and everything,

32:59.778 --> 33:01.180
but I can't let you pack.

33:01.213 --> 33:03.482
Something goes wrong,
just hug the ground,

33:03.515 --> 33:04.783
and I'll protect you.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.686
I'm touched.
Don't be.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.721
Too much paperwork to fill out
if you get killed.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.325
(clattering)

33:13.359 --> 33:14.493
ALEXANDER:
Eva.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.730
Sasha, you're okay.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.469
It's okay.

33:23.502 --> 33:26.072
(speaking Russian)
English. English,
remember?

33:27.506 --> 33:28.774
Sorry.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.177
I'm so happy to see you.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.711
I am, too.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.746
But you're supposed
to be in Berlin,

33:34.780 --> 33:36.382
living a normal life.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.650
I had to come save you.
Save her from what?

33:38.684 --> 33:41.753
My post at the embassy gave me
access to intelligence briefs.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.390
One of them was
a list of Russian
operatives in America.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.757
Your name had
a red line through it.

33:47.126 --> 33:49.061
It means I'm marked for death.

33:49.095 --> 33:52.464
I had to come find you--
offer up the list
to get you protection.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.732
Well, that was
very brave

33:53.765 --> 33:55.434
and extremely stupid.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.469
Because Eva was
already protected,

33:57.503 --> 33:58.737
serving 60 to life.

33:58.770 --> 33:59.838
Is that true?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.840
It's a long story.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.675
Now you're marked
for death, too.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.444
Eva is the only family
that I have.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.146
And I haven't seen her
for ten years.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.314
So the risk
was worth it.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.382
All right, well, we can compose
the Hallmark card later.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.783
Right now
we go to NCIS.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.253
I'll call Pride
and let him know.

34:18.757 --> 34:21.593
I turned this phone off
when we hit the road.

34:21.627 --> 34:22.728
You saw that, right?

34:22.761 --> 34:24.096
Yeah.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.098
Someone turned it back on.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.469
SEBASTIAN:
You've got a lot
of explaining to do.

34:30.502 --> 34:33.439
You knew Gregorio was going
off the reservation with Eva.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.874
Yes, but no one else can.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.843
SONJA:
I don't get it.

34:37.876 --> 34:40.579
Why would you let Barns put
a BOLO out on her car anyway?

34:40.612 --> 34:42.581
Gregorio's nowhere near her car.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.284
She and Eva are getting
Alexander and bringing him back.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.685
So I'm good enough
to be her roommate,

34:46.718 --> 34:48.654
but not good enough
to be in on the secret plan.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.789
My call. Fewer people
who know, the better.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.558
Hey, man, that
ship has sailed.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.793
Gregorio's phone has
been remotely accessed.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.862
The Russians have
her location.
What? How?

34:56.895 --> 34:59.865
Someone placed digital bugs
on all our electronics.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.533
They're monitoring
the whole team.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.701
LASALLE:
I thought we had firewalls.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.237
We do, Lasalle.
It's an inside job.

35:05.271 --> 35:08.174
All right, figured it out.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.909
You people know exactly
where Gregorio and Eva are.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.179
I thought I was the only one
going off book this time.

35:13.212 --> 35:15.747
Yeah, way too far off book,
since you've been bugging NCIS.

35:15.781 --> 35:18.750
That's ridiculous. We're
supposed to be on the same side.
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, well,

35:18.784 --> 35:20.552
someone's using FBI tech
to monitor us,

35:20.586 --> 35:22.221
so it's either you or...
It's Barns.

35:23.689 --> 35:27.293
Sebastian, get us Gregorio's
exact location now.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.594
Isler with me. Let's go.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.664
(rapid gunfire in distance)

35:37.669 --> 35:38.737
(gunfire)

35:40.406 --> 35:42.908
Get down!

35:42.941 --> 35:44.576
Get down now!

35:47.713 --> 35:48.880
Three rounds.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.449
I saw at least three guys.
All right, listen,

35:50.482 --> 35:51.517
I'll draw their fire.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.551
Get Alexander back to the car

35:52.584 --> 35:53.819
and get the hell out of here.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.721
It's not up for debate! Go!

36:11.503 --> 36:13.705
It's okay. Coast is clear.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.577
Gregorio?
She's behind us.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.379
Good.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.780
ALEXANDER:
Eva! No!

36:39.598 --> 36:40.699
(Gregorio yelling)

36:41.433 --> 36:42.768
Alex, get out of here! Go!

36:42.801 --> 36:44.736
(grunting)

36:54.045 --> 36:55.381
Get down!

36:57.783 --> 37:00.018
Alexander, you're all right.
We're NCIS.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.854
You're safe now. Listen,
where is Gregorio and Eva?

37:02.888 --> 37:03.955
A woman attacked us.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.524
Eva's dead.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.694
Pride, we secured
Alexander and one suspect.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.397
Gregorio's in the park with
Barns. She needs help.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.565
PRIDE:
Copy, Sonja. On our way.
Come on.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.934
(grunting)

37:22.374 --> 37:24.242
PRIDE:
Drop it now!

37:25.477 --> 37:27.279
I can explain what
happened here.

37:27.313 --> 37:28.780
She shot Eva is what happened.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.582
No, she was gonna attack me.
Load of crap!

37:30.616 --> 37:32.951
Shut up! I'm telling
the truth, Isler.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.920
You're a double agent, Barns.
PRIDE:
Put the gun down now,

37:34.953 --> 37:36.588
or we will shoot.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.023
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.693
(grunting)

37:43.995 --> 37:45.697
You don't get
off that easy.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.799
You got too much to answer for.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.335
(Barns groaning)

37:53.972 --> 37:55.073
Alexander?

37:55.106 --> 37:57.543
Safe with Lasalle
and Sonja.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.584
Hey.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.353
You okay, New York?

38:07.386 --> 38:10.889
Honestly... I don't know.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.926
(panting)

38:21.467 --> 38:23.469
PRIDE:
I'll let you know
about her ETA.

38:23.502 --> 38:24.970
Yeah. I appreciate that.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.605
Y'all get anything out of Barns?

38:26.638 --> 38:27.939
Uh, took a while, but, uh,

38:27.973 --> 38:29.508
she finally opened up.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.976
Yeah, Russian intelligence
caught her

38:31.009 --> 38:32.478
in a honey trap a few years ago.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.045
She's been feeding them intel
ever since.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.047
Got freaked when she heard
about the list of operatives

38:36.081 --> 38:39.818
that Alexander had taken
since her name is on it.

38:39.851 --> 38:43.522
Well, we got the list and Barns.
Not bad for government work.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.691
I say, let's celebrate.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.893
The FBI director doesn't
share your optimism, Percy.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.128
I'm on the first plane
back to D.C.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.930
for an official inquest
tomorrow morning.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.665
Ah, what you got to worry about?

38:53.699 --> 38:54.933
You flushed out a double agent.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.502
Who happened to be my protégé.

38:56.535 --> 38:59.070
She fooled me
for months.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.006
Convinced me to run an
off-the-books operation

39:01.039 --> 39:03.875
that killed a sailor
and almost took out your team.

39:03.909 --> 39:04.876
No.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.145
I'm... screwed.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.549
You know we got your back.
Willing to put a word in

39:10.582 --> 39:14.019
up in D.C.
on your behalf.
Mm.

39:14.052 --> 39:17.923
Somehow that doesn't fill me
with hope, but thank you.

39:22.728 --> 39:26.031
You still want
to celebrate, King?

39:26.064 --> 39:28.867
Got a conference call
with deputy director.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.870
Need to debrief him
on our little adventure.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.005
Yeah, but this one wasn't
exactly on the books.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.607
How you gonna explain it?

39:35.641 --> 39:37.643
Selectively.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.880
(sighs)

39:41.913 --> 39:45.884
You, um, want
to talk about today?

39:45.917 --> 39:48.153
Feel like there's a lot
of tension between us.

39:48.186 --> 39:50.055
Absolutely not.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.458
Just leave it be.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.173
(inhales deeply)

40:10.576 --> 40:12.744
EVA:
Whatever you do,
don't open it.

40:16.114 --> 40:19.718
Whoever's in there doesn't
look anything like me.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.453
Cadaver from a
medical school.

40:21.487 --> 40:24.189
Best I could do
on such short notice, Tammy.

40:24.222 --> 40:27.092
It's not every day I'm asked
to falsify death records

40:27.125 --> 40:30.028
on a woman who's clearly
in the pink of health.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.798
I'm Eva Azarova.
No, you're not.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.501
Eva Azarova died heroically

40:35.534 --> 40:37.869
in a U.S.
counterintelligence operation.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.906
Well, whoever I am now,
I just want to thank you.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.041
Don't thank me.
Thank Dwayne and that one

40:43.074 --> 40:46.678
for working it all out.
I'm just filing the paperwork.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.079
Now, if you'll excuse me,

40:48.113 --> 40:50.982
I have to transfer
your body to the FBI.

40:55.253 --> 40:59.090
Thought you'd be gone by now.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.226
Yeah, the marshals wanted
to move us as soon as possible,

41:01.259 --> 41:03.629
but, um, I couldn't
leave without

41:03.662 --> 41:04.896
first returning this to you.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.665
(laughs)

41:06.698 --> 41:09.134
Sorry. I think
I kind of broke it.
No.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.036
Keep it.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.071
Might come in handy.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.140
Not where I'm going.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.812
They sending you
to Montana?

41:20.846 --> 41:22.781
You know,
they won't say,

41:22.814 --> 41:24.816
but I'm sure it's
somewhere out west.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.885
I have you to thank
for that, too.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.921
No. You and Alexander
helped take down

41:29.955 --> 41:31.890
a major intelligence network.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.526
It's only fair that you get
a shot at a normal life.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.029
Yeah, but the problem is,

41:38.063 --> 41:41.900
I don't know
if I'll ever see you again.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.035
Never say never.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.922
(sighs)
