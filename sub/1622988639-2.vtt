[radio chatter]

00:10.635 --> 00:12.262
[man shouting]

00:19.686 --> 00:20.645
Feel better?

00:20.729 --> 00:21.688
Yeah, I do.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.317
[man shouting]

00:31.740 --> 00:32.991
Hey, you ready to go?

00:34.659 --> 00:37.162
The fire chief said
there's nothing more we can do.

00:39.873 --> 00:40.707
Okay.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.837
Brie will stay at the Fitches'
if you want your room at the bar,

00:46.337 --> 00:48.214
but you can stay with me if you want.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.592
I don't feel so good.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.928
[Jack retches]

00:57.474 --> 01:00.351
-Hey.
-The adrenaline's making him nauseous.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.604
Yeah. I need to get him out of here.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.939
He might also be dealing
with triggers from Iraq.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.484
-I know.
-[Doc sighs] I'm so sorry.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.195
-I know this is rough on both of you.
-Thanks.

01:12.072 --> 01:12.989
Let's go.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.491
Okay.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.078
Thanks.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.711
How's he holding up?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.714
Honestly, I don't know.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.510
A man can only take so much

01:34.803 --> 01:36.221
before he breaks.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.319
Can I get you something to eat?

01:52.570 --> 01:53.655
No, thanks.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.324
-Are you sure?
-No, I'm good. Thank you.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.119
[grunts]

02:06.000 --> 02:08.670
Hey, you don't have
to put on a brave face,

02:09.838 --> 02:11.548
you know, especially with me.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.554
You just lost your house. It's a big deal.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.766
There's no point
getting worked up about it, is there?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.352
Not gonna change anything.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.105
Still, it's okay
to feel what you're feeling.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.232
I feel like it's been
one thing after another.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.985
I know. You've been through a lot.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.361
So have you.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.613
Yeah, and you let me cry,

02:36.364 --> 02:37.907
and yell… [chuckles softly]

02:38.825 --> 02:40.410
…and then cry some more.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.496
Getting emotional
doesn't really work for me.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.874
I just end up breaking things.

02:45.957 --> 02:49.252
Well, you can break whatever you want,

02:50.170 --> 02:54.299
but I'd prefer you do it at the bar
because I don't have renters' insurance.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.343
I'll remember that
next time I feel like smashing stuff.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.470
Hey, hey.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.849
I'm here for you. Whatever you need.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.350
Yeah.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.938
Thanks. I'm gonna grab a shower
and try to get some sleep.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.856
Okay.

03:11.941 --> 03:12.859
[Mel] Hey.

03:14.777 --> 03:15.904
I love you.

03:16.487 --> 03:17.447
Love you too.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.794
[theme music playing]

03:39.427 --> 03:40.762
Yeah, no, that'd be great.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.847
Okay, I'll come by tomorrow.

03:44.140 --> 03:44.974
Thank you.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.559
Bye.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.436
-[Jack inhales]
-[phone beeps]

03:48.519 --> 03:49.354
Hey.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.941
-Hey.
-Was that the fire investigator?

03:54.234 --> 03:58.029
No, it was Jo Ellen.
I called to see if she had any vacancies.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.198
Oh. Okay.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.367
Do you not want to stay here?

04:02.450 --> 04:06.079
[hesitates] It's not that.
It's just there's not a lot of room.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.706
Well, I mean,
I can clear out one of the closets.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.792
Doc will let me store stuff at the clinic.

04:10.875 --> 04:14.045
-I don't want you to have to do that.
-It's really not a problem.

04:14.128 --> 04:17.882
What is it that Hope said
about guests and fish?

04:17.966 --> 04:19.550
I don't wanna overstay my welcome.

04:19.634 --> 04:24.222
That was a completely different situation,
and we're in a relationship.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.683
It doesn't mean we won't get
on each other's nerves.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.937
Oh, I'm sorry.
What do I do that annoys you?

04:31.020 --> 04:33.398
Nothing.
It's more that I would be bothering you.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.942
I just-- I don't want you
to feel obligated to have me here.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.152
-I don't.
-It's been one night.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.824
All right. Well, you think about it.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.535
I gotta go to work. I'll see you later.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.370
Okay.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.289
Bye.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.628
[radio] Hurricane Ida has shifted course.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.381
Residents of Hilton Head,
Port Royal Island,

04:58.464 --> 05:00.383
and Fort Fremont, South Carolina

05:00.466 --> 05:03.052
are bracing for landfall
later this evening.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.763
Upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane,

05:05.847 --> 05:09.684
forecasters are predicting
storm surges nine to 12 feet high

05:09.767 --> 05:12.145
-with winds up to 125 miles per--

-[radio turns off]
-[phone line ringing]

05:14.897 --> 05:18.776
[operator] Your call has been forwarded
to an automated voice messaging system.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.069
[voice mail beeps]

05:20.153 --> 05:21.237
Hope, hi, it's me.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.323
Listen, if you're still in Port Royal,

05:23.406 --> 05:26.743
you and Nancy
need to evacuate immediately.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.121
This hurricane has gotten too strong
for you to try and ride it out.

05:30.204 --> 05:34.334
Uh, your best bet
is to drive to Allendale.

05:34.417 --> 05:37.337
That is the safest route
that I can figure out.

05:37.420 --> 05:43.092
Uh, you take Highway 21 North
to Highway 278 West.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.679
And call me the minute you get there,
and let me know that you're okay.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.350
[inhales deeply] And just
be careful out there, will ya? Um…

05:51.684 --> 05:52.643
I love you.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.312
[door opens]

05:55.104 --> 05:56.522
-Bye.
-[keypad beeps]

05:57.106 --> 05:58.441
-Good morning.
-Hey.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.069
By chance,
do you have Mrs. Gardner's file?

06:01.152 --> 06:04.197
She's coming for a well-check today,
which should be interesting.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.114
Uh-huh.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.240
The last time I saw her,

06:06.324 --> 06:10.161
she told me to enjoy my figure
while I'm young

06:10.244 --> 06:12.413
because someday my metabolism will stop,

06:12.497 --> 06:15.750
and I won't be able
to wear skinny jeans anymore.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.836
Yeah, her… [sighs]
…her file's in the office.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.046
Okay.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.424
Hey, is everything okay?

06:26.135 --> 06:29.222
Category 3 hurricane
is headed straight for Port Royal Island.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.807
Oh my God! [hesitates]

06:30.890 --> 06:32.642
Were they able to evacuate?

06:33.476 --> 06:36.479
I… I don't know. I haven't been able
to reach Hope or her aunt,

06:36.562 --> 06:38.689
and I think maybe their power is out.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.150
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.404
-[sighs] Yeah.
-I can cover if you need to go home.

06:44.487 --> 06:48.241
Nothing I can do at home.
I might as well distract myself with work.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.575
[quietly] Okay.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.579
Well, let me know if you change your mind
or if you need anything.

06:54.163 --> 06:56.666
Very kind of you. I'll be okay.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.420
So, uh, how's Jack doing?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.339
Uh, yeah, he…

07:03.965 --> 07:05.383
he says he's fine.

07:06.509 --> 07:10.054
He wants to stay at the B&B
instead of staying with me.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.639
Well, not surprising.

07:12.723 --> 07:17.520
I mean, Jack is pretty self-reliant.
In fact, that's a point of pride for him.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.022
That's definitely true.

07:20.106 --> 07:24.735
Right, so maybe he just
needs to stand on his own for a while

07:24.819 --> 07:27.655
to feel like he has
some control over his life.

07:27.738 --> 07:28.698
[Mel] Hm.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.952
So you're saying I should be supportive
if he wants to stay at the B&B.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.955
I am not saying anything.
I'm just calling it like I see it.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.458
-Chicken.
-Yeah, a chicken with a lot of experience.

07:39.834 --> 07:45.089
Oh, um, Lilly came by looking for you
last night while I was closing out.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.508
-Oh, is Chloe okay?
-Chloe's fine.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.094
I just sensed it was a lady thing.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.804
-"A lady thing."
-Yeah.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.599
Are you sure you're not a character
from Outlander?

07:54.682 --> 07:56.017
Oh, very funny.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.226
[door closes]

07:58.227 --> 07:59.479
I'm afraid I'm a bit early.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.730
Good morning, Virginia.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.983
That's okay.
You can have a seat. I'll be right there.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.404
Uh, well, I'm gonna go grab her file.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.830
[cell phone ringing]

08:18.956 --> 08:20.166
Hello? Hello?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.169
Vernon, hi. It's Julia from the agency.

08:23.252 --> 08:24.587
[disappointed] Oh.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.880
Hi. Hi, how are you?

08:25.963 --> 08:27.632
I'm good, thank you.

08:27.715 --> 08:31.093
So I have two promising candidates
coming in to meet with you today.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.178
That's very good.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.597
Will there be anyone else
joining the interview?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.724
-Such as?
-Your nurse.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.685
It can be helpful
to have another perspective in the room.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.897
I told you this search
will remain confidential.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.274
Oh, I thought you meant externally.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.653
When it comes to small businesses,
usually new hires are transparent.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.865
I run my clinic on a need-to-know basis.
Right now, nobody else needs to know.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.744
Of course, but you'd wanna know
if there was a personality issue

08:56.827 --> 08:58.538
before bringing someone in.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.415
And in my experience,
when employees are blindsided,

09:01.499 --> 09:03.793
it can cause quite a headache
for management.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.796
Well, this management
is going to stay the course.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.340
-You have a nice day.
-You too.

09:10.925 --> 09:11.842
[keypad beeps]

09:14.470 --> 09:15.304
[sighs]

09:21.185 --> 09:23.104
Oh, don't mind me.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.565
Grandma, you don't need
to cover your eyes.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.150
Oh, I don't wanna invade your privacy.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.777
[quietly] What privacy?

09:31.362 --> 09:35.074
Uh, so I made some shortbread for you
this morning.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.951
-Thanks, Grandma.
-There you go, dear.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.452
That was so nice of you.

09:38.953 --> 09:43.916
[Lydie] Okay. Uh, back to my room.
Call me if you need anything.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.295
[door closes]

09:50.923 --> 09:52.341
[Lizzie giggles]

09:52.425 --> 09:55.136
-[door opens]
-[Lydie] Forgot the milk. [laughs]

09:56.053 --> 09:58.222
Can't have cookies without milk.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.851
Isn't she great? [chuckles]

10:02.768 --> 10:03.811
All right.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.605
Here we are, dears.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.774
There's one for you, and one for you.

10:09.984 --> 10:13.279
And now, um,
is there anything else I can get you?

10:13.988 --> 10:17.158
-Can I have a napkin?
-[Lydie] Oh, well, of course, dear.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.997
-[quietly] What?
-A napkin? Really?

10:28.753 --> 10:29.670
There you are.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.506
-Now I'll get out of your hair.
-[chuckles]

10:36.636 --> 10:40.389
-What do you have against napkins?
-Don't you want to be alone with me?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.641
We are alone.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.435
We aren't. Your grandma might as well
be sitting between us.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.312
-Well, this is her house.
-Exactly.

10:46.395 --> 10:50.316
So if you ever wanna have sex again,
you better find somewhere we can be alone.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.695
[door opens]

10:56.447 --> 10:57.365
[door slams shut]

11:03.788 --> 11:05.081
Here we go. [sighs]

11:05.998 --> 11:06.874
Hey!

11:07.750 --> 11:09.335
I tried calling you last night.

11:09.418 --> 11:13.047
[sighs] Yeah, sorry.
I wasn't up for chatting.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.340
Are you okay?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.425
I'm fine. [sighs]

11:17.593 --> 11:20.513
The house is gone,
but that's what insurance is for, right?

11:22.723 --> 11:24.850
-You need to play the lottery.
-Why is that?

11:24.934 --> 11:26.310
Because the universe owes you.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.396
I don't think the universe gives a crap.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.815
Well, are you staying with Mel?

11:30.898 --> 11:32.024
Yeah, for now.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.112
I gotta decide if I wanna move in with her
or stay at the Fitches'.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.489
Why would you wanna stay at the B&B?

11:38.572 --> 11:41.450
I don't want her to feel overwhelmed.
She's got enough on her plate.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.868
What does she want you to do?

11:42.952 --> 11:45.371
She wants me to stay with her.
What else is she gonna say?

11:45.454 --> 11:47.957
I don't know her that well,
but she seems pretty direct.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.085
She is. She's also compassionate.
She could be offering out of sympathy.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.337
[scoffs] I don't think that's the case.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.424
But if you're uncomfortable, move back.
I'll stay at the B&B.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.384
I thought you were heading home soon.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.556
Uh, I actually decided
to take some extra personal time.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.141
And your boss signed off on that?

12:05.224 --> 12:06.559
Hey, don't worry about me.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.769
Just take care of yourself, huh?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.065
-[Brie] Hi.
-[Mel] Hey!

12:14.775 --> 12:16.068
[Jack warily] Hello.

12:16.152 --> 12:16.986
Hi.

12:17.069 --> 12:20.364
-You don't have to check up on me.
-I'm just getting some lunch.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.158
-Oh, really?
-Mm-hmm.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.327
-It's not even noon.
-I know, and I'm already starving.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.788
-[suspiciously] Mm-hmm.
-[Mel] What?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.124
You know that it's a known fact

12:30.207 --> 12:33.002
that stress triggers hormones
related to appetite.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.046
That's why they call it stress eating.

12:37.381 --> 12:41.051
Oh, so this is about your stress
from last night, not mine.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.052
Correct.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.889
If you hadn't been a nurse,
you'd have been a great attorney.

12:45.806 --> 12:46.932
Thank you.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.019
So, any news on the house?

12:50.102 --> 12:53.606
Yeah, they say faulty wiring in the attic
caused the fire.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.316
Oh. Well, that's good news.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.402
Well, that it wasn't set intentionally.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.822
Oh, wow. You're setting the bar
for good news pretty low there.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.950
Yeah, it increases the amount of good news
in the world.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.410
Good point.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.787
[Preacher] Hey, Mel.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.373
Sorry I'm late. Connie came by to help,
and after she cleaned up the kitchen,

13:11.457 --> 13:13.292
it took me half an hour to find my keys.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.212
-Her heart was in the right place.
-Just not your keys.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.338
[Preacher, Jack groan]

13:17.421 --> 13:19.423
-[Preacher] Funny.
-[Mel] Thank you.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.467
Why don't I get a server
to bring your food?

13:21.550 --> 13:23.511
Oh, that would be great. Thank you.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.263
Uh, I'll take the barbecue chicken salad.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.723
-Copy that.
-[Mel] Thanks.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.644
Um, you'll come over tonight, right?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.562
Yeah. I'll bring dinner.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.648
Great. I'll see you then.

13:38.901 --> 13:42.196
Hey! Man, I heard about the fire.
How you doing?

13:42.279 --> 13:44.657
Sick and tired
of people askin' how I'm doing.

13:45.282 --> 13:49.495
Right. You've never been a good patient.
You had a six-inch hole in your back.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.665
Two days later, you're asking
when you could get back to your squad.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.334
-I hate being down and out, you know that.
-I hear ya.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.171
I, uh, did find something
that might cheer you up though.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.089
What's that?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.383
-A lead on Jimmy's location.
-Oh yeah?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.885
I'm on my way over
to speak with Sheriff Duncan.

14:04.969 --> 14:05.886
All right.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.180
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.058
Man, I feel bad.
You gotta be missing the action back home.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.311
I'm actually digging Virgin River.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.896
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.857
I never pictured you as a small-town guy.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.942
I like the vibe. Yeah.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.235
Like today, before work,

14:21.318 --> 14:23.988
instead of being stuck in traffic,
I went fishing.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.698
Right? You catch any?

14:25.781 --> 14:27.324
-That wasn't the point.
-[laughs]

14:27.408 --> 14:29.827
-Fish just gotta get used to me.
-Yeah, keep trying.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.537
-Later, brother.
-Thank you, man.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.130
[shushes] Please don't cry. Here we go.

14:42.631 --> 14:46.051
Thank you. It's okay. See?
We're on the move now, honeybun.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.429
It's okay. It's okay.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.808
[baby crying]

14:52.892 --> 14:54.143
It's okay, sweetie.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.729
[baby crying loudly]

14:56.812 --> 14:58.731
Here you go. That's a good girl.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.942
-[Lilly breathes deeply]
-[crying continues]

15:02.026 --> 15:04.153
No. [shushes] It's okay, buddy.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.739
Mom, what are you doing?
I thought you wanted to shop.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.991
I needed some fresh air. That's all.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.078
-You sure you're okay? You look tired.
-Well, I'm getting old, I guess.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.372
I don't have the energy I had
when you were little.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.540
You're not old.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.084
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm 100.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.088
It's because you do too much.
You're taking care of me and Chloe.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.007
I'm a grown-up. I can do my own laundry.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.594
I like doing things for you.
I won't always be around to do them.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.721
What are you talking about?

15:30.804 --> 15:34.099
If you're like Grandma Fran,
you'll be playing with Chloe's grandkids.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.601
Wouldn't that be something.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.653
First in your class,
University of Washington. Terrific school.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.782
You've been practicing family medicine
at San Francisco General.

15:49.865 --> 15:50.699
Correct.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.952
And currently living in Grace Valley.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.037
Yes, my wife grew up there.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.164
So, you'd be willing
to live in Virgin River?

15:57.247 --> 15:58.457
No, I'd… I'd commute.

15:59.708 --> 16:03.504
Aside from your nurse practitioner,
how many medical assistants do you have?

16:04.505 --> 16:05.339
None.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.885
If you live two hours away,
how would you handle after-hours calls?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.429
I guess they'd drive
to the Urgent Care in Clear River.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.682
Oh, you guess.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.809
You guessed wrong.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.989
-Hey, boss, we got a problem.
-What is it?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.533
The hydraulic hose
on a feller buncher ruptured.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.827
Damn it.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.872
-[sighs] Is everyone all right?
-Bud nearly lost his hand.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.624
Christ. [exhales]

16:41.458 --> 16:43.293
So? What's the damage?

16:43.377 --> 16:46.338
New feller buncher costs around 50k.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.425
We don't have that.
How much to repair the one we've got?

16:49.508 --> 16:53.220
We'd need a heavy vehicle mechanic.
A good one will run you 40 bucks an hour.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.431
Find someone
willing to charge a flat rate.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.434
Uh, those guys don't grow on trees.

16:59.935 --> 17:00.769
[sighs]

17:02.104 --> 17:03.272
But I'll figure it out.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.398
[Brady] And let's…

17:05.024 --> 17:07.359
let's keep this to ourselves, all right?

17:07.443 --> 17:10.112
Guys start thinking
the company's in trouble, they'll bolt,

17:10.863 --> 17:11.947
then I'm screwed.

17:12.865 --> 17:13.699
All right.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.246
[exhales quietly]

17:31.884 --> 17:36.263
Oh, follow that road, and it'll take you
right back to the main highway.

17:36.346 --> 17:39.808
[man] Okay. Thanks. Let me know if you
change your mind about the references.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.103
-Hey.
-Hey! Who was that?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.355
Oh, just some tourist.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.357
Asking about references?

17:47.441 --> 17:51.320
-I thought he said preferences.
-[laughs] Preferences for what?

17:51.403 --> 17:54.448
Well, your guess is as good as mine.
Would you like some coffee?

17:54.531 --> 17:56.158
Yes, please. I would love it.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.994
Oh, and I brought you this.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.039
Oh, that jam.

18:02.122 --> 18:02.998
Strawberry.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.753
Thank you. I hope you didn't go
to too much trouble on my account.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.004
No. Not at all.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.422
Thanks.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.551
-So…
-[Doc sighs]

18:14.635 --> 18:15.969
…have you heard from Hope?

18:17.179 --> 18:18.806
No. [sighs deeply]

18:18.889 --> 18:20.641
-No.
-Anything on the news?

18:20.724 --> 18:23.769
The weather may have made it impossible
for them to evacuate.

18:23.852 --> 18:27.231
Her aunt, Nancy,
she's almost 90, in a wheelchair,

18:27.314 --> 18:29.817
and Hope would never leave her behind.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.027
The island is very exposed.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.447
Any substantial storm surge
and then the flooding--

18:35.531 --> 18:36.657
Okay, listen.

18:36.740 --> 18:40.202
If I had to bet money on someone
to survive a natural disaster,

18:40.285 --> 18:41.120
it'd be Hope.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.374
Ida has no idea what she is up against.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.711
Why don't we have a game of backgammon
to distract you?

18:50.838 --> 18:54.550
Well, I suppose I do have some time
before my next appointment.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.426
Mm, excellent.

18:56.510 --> 19:00.305
-Set's in the office. I'll be right back.
-And I will clear the table.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.361
I am not so sure I can focus.

19:14.903 --> 19:18.657
-That's all right. No pressure from me.
-[sarcastically] Oh, yeah.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.410
-You'll just double the bet.
-[laughs]

19:34.631 --> 19:35.632
Oh, Mel.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.094
Oh, Brie! Hey!

19:39.178 --> 19:42.598
-What are you doing here in Clear River?
-Picking up clothes for Jack.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.892
-Oh, so am I.
-[Brie chuckles]

19:44.975 --> 19:47.227
I felt like I was drowning
in a sea of plaid.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.229
Well, you obviously know my brother.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.232
I think he came out of the womb
wearing a button-down flannel.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.693
-I can picture that.
-[Brie chuckles]

19:54.776 --> 19:58.655
There's a nail salon just down the street.
I was gonna try it out. Wanna come?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.701
Um, yeah. Doc said I had some time.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.329
-So there's no reason not to go.
-That's right. Okay.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.457
So, how often do you visit Jack?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.668
I actually haven't seen him
for about a year and a half.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.756
Last time was when I came
to see a friend from college

20:15.839 --> 20:17.382
who'd moved to Garberville.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.051
Oh. Where'd you go to college?

20:19.134 --> 20:21.386
-I went to Chapman for undergrad.
-Stop.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.597
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.225
-I went to Chapman.
-No way!

20:26.308 --> 20:28.769
-Yes!
-I've never met anyone who went there.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.021
-Most people haven't heard of it.
-I know!

20:31.104 --> 20:33.148
I can't believe this.
When did you graduate?

20:33.232 --> 20:36.151
-2007.
-We were there at the same time. [laughs]

20:36.235 --> 20:38.070
-What was your major?
-Political science.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.322
-Health sciences.
-Opposite sides of the campus.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.033
-Still, I'm sure we crossed paths.
-I'm sure we did.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.118
What a small world.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.340
May I help you?

20:58.423 --> 20:59.800
I have a surprise for you.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.844
-If you brought me lunch, I already ate.
-It's not lunch.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.930
Then what is it?

21:05.013 --> 21:07.432
If I tell you,
then it won't be a surprise anymore.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.351
Okay. Then why are you telling me now?

21:10.102 --> 21:12.980
You need to tell Connie
you're spending the night at a friend's.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.439
Why would I do that?

21:14.523 --> 21:16.108
Because I'm taking you somewhere.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.986
Somewhere not in Virgin River?

21:19.736 --> 21:21.280
-Correct.
-Okay.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.157
-What should I wear?
-Just normal clothes.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.993
-Will I need a jacket?
-Don't think so.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.411
-A sleeping bag?
-No.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.788
-Will there be candy?
-There can be if you want.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.123
Do I need pajamas?

21:31.999 --> 21:32.833
No.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.294
Okay.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.296
Now I'm intrigued.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.589
Good. That's what I was going for.

21:39.673 --> 21:40.799
[giggles]

21:46.805 --> 21:50.183
-Can't believe how ragged my nails were.
-Oh, I know. Me too.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.977
I love that color. What's it called?

21:52.060 --> 21:53.937
Isn't it cute? Put It In Neutral.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.315
-Red Hot Rio.
-Bold!

21:56.398 --> 21:58.358
-You know what else we should try?
-Hm?

21:58.442 --> 22:00.235
Temper. It's a pastry shop.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.654
They have this milk chocolate
salted caramel cake.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.905
Oh, stop.

22:03.989 --> 22:04.990
Ooh.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.620
-What do you think?
-Cute. It goes with your nails.

22:10.704 --> 22:11.580
You think?

22:11.663 --> 22:12.622
-Oh God!
-Whoa!

22:14.082 --> 22:15.500
-Sorry.
-Are you okay?

22:15.584 --> 22:16.752
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.670
-Here, let me help.
-All good. I got it.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.188
[Ricky] Surprise!

22:36.271 --> 22:39.066
Oh my God! It's so romantic!

22:40.609 --> 22:43.111
-You like it?
-Uh, yeah! [laughs]

22:48.158 --> 22:49.951
-[bell dings]
-[giggling]

22:51.411 --> 22:52.537
Can I help you?

22:52.621 --> 22:55.957
Oh, uh, yeah. We'd like a cabin, please.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.251
Mm-hm.
And are you accompanied by an adult?

22:58.335 --> 22:59.836
Oh, well, we're both, uh, 18.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.547
Well, actually, she's, uh, 19, so…
[laughs nervously]

23:03.840 --> 23:05.926
I'm gonna need to see both your IDs.

23:06.009 --> 23:06.968
Uh…

23:11.640 --> 23:12.891
Uh… [laughs nervously]

23:16.019 --> 23:18.563
-When will you be checking out?
-Tomorrow.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.606
[quietly] Mm-hmm.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.192
Luggage?

23:22.275 --> 23:23.735
No. Uh…

23:23.819 --> 23:25.028
I'll be right back.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.367
-I think he thinks we're gonna have sex.
-We are gonna have sex.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.746
Okay, two double beds…

23:34.830 --> 23:36.331
We'd like a king, please.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.749
Okay, fine.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.377
I'm gonna need a credit card
for incidentals.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.879
-I only have cash.
-[scoffs] I'm sorry, sir.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.298
We require a credit card
to secure the cabin.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.217
-Here.
-Thank you.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.638
[chuckling quietly]

24:07.737 --> 24:10.699
Hey, I know you. We met at Jack's.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.576
Oh, you're, um--

24:12.659 --> 24:13.577
Brie.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.245
Brie. Right.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.456
What can I get you?

24:17.539 --> 24:20.000
Uh, I'll have a whiskey sour.
Do you want a drink?

24:21.668 --> 24:23.920
No, thanks. I, uh, should get going.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.422
I was just being polite.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.385
Well, if you're gonna twist my arm,
uh, I'll have another one.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.973
I'll get the next round.

24:35.056 --> 24:38.310
-How do you know there'll be a next round?
-From experience.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.604
Well, that's a bold statement.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.523
-Does Jack know you're here?
-No. Why?

24:44.524 --> 24:46.985
He wouldn't want me
having drinks with his sister.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.570
How do you know I'm his sister?

24:49.696 --> 24:52.532
Small town.
I might've asked around a little.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.367
Oh, you did, did you?

24:55.452 --> 24:57.829
[scoffs] Any other dirt
I should be aware of?

24:58.580 --> 25:01.416
I heard you're an attorney,
and you're single.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.919
Wow, you've got quite the grapevine.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.629
Well, did I hear wrong?

25:05.712 --> 25:10.592
Well, one is true,
and the other one is complicated.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.429
-You gonna tell me which is which?
-Doubt it.

25:14.513 --> 25:15.514
Why?

25:15.597 --> 25:16.890
Because I don't know you.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.019
Well, we should fix that.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.531
[Preacher] You okay if I go?
I wanna have dinner with Christopher.

25:32.614 --> 25:36.117
Yeah, you get out of here. It's slow.
I was thinking about closing soon.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.578
Decide what you're gonna do about Mel?

25:39.829 --> 25:42.541
-I thought about staying with her, but--
-Yeah, but?

25:43.750 --> 25:46.878
-I think I'm gonna check into the B&B.
-Yeah? How come?

25:48.046 --> 25:51.091
It's easier. I won't have to worry
about imposing on her, you know?

25:51.174 --> 25:55.053
Or you could view it as an opportunity
to find out if you two really connect.

25:55.136 --> 25:58.723
And if we don't? That's not something
I wanna find out right now.

25:58.807 --> 26:03.645
Well, I gotta say I have never known you
to shy away from anything.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.358
-[Charmaine] Hey!
-Hey.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.403
-I could really use a 7 and 7 right now.
-Settle for a 7 Up?

26:11.486 --> 26:13.613
That seems to be
my drink of choice these days.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.700
-No, Preach, you go. I got it.
-Thanks. Bye, Charmaine.

26:16.783 --> 26:17.701
Bye.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.327
[Charmaine] Wow!

26:20.745 --> 26:24.874
You know, I still remember
the first time I came into this place.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.543
You spent 20 minutes

26:26.626 --> 26:29.629
trying to talk me out
of ordering a white zinfandel.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.423
Unsuccessfully, I might add.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.509
Yeah, well, I appreciated the effort.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.221
And doesn't that feel like
a million years ago?

26:39.097 --> 26:41.891
Well, we've had a lot happen since then.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.602
Yeah, we have.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.062
Um, listen,

26:47.188 --> 26:48.481
I came here to apologize.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.442
For what?

26:51.192 --> 26:54.779
I was really hard on you
throughout our breakup,

26:54.863 --> 26:58.366
and I shouldn't have pushed you
the way that I did.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.492
It's okay.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.912
No, it's not. I get it now.

27:02.996 --> 27:06.374
The minute I met Todd, it was just like…

27:06.458 --> 27:08.627
[imitates explosion, giggles]
"Wow," you know?

27:08.710 --> 27:12.922
-And you and I were never like that.
-I wasn't looking for anything permanent.

27:13.006 --> 27:17.302
I know. And I was,
and I should've listened to you.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.473
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.477
And I am so happy that you found Mel

27:25.560 --> 27:28.271
because if you didn't,
I never would've met Todd. [laughs]

27:28.355 --> 27:30.065
Well, I'm happy that you're happy.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.902
But I gotta ask.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.989
I mean, I never would've pictured you
with a guy like Todd.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.074
Why not?

27:39.157 --> 27:41.451
Well, you know, the personal barber.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.329
The income property.
You gotta admit, he's a little much.

27:44.412 --> 27:48.166
No, no, no. That's what I love about him.
I mean, he's confident,

27:48.249 --> 27:51.252
and he wants to get married
and have a big family.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.296
And thanks to his income property,

27:53.380 --> 27:56.633
you don't need to worry
about finding another place for the twins.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.511
What does that mean?

28:00.095 --> 28:03.640
I… I heard about the fire,
and I'm so sorry, by the way.

28:04.391 --> 28:08.144
Uh, but at least you don't have to stress
about finding another house.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.521
I'm not stressed out.

28:09.604 --> 28:11.856
I spoke to the contractor
about rebuilding.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.567
Oh, construction always takes longer
than you think.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.195
So instead of renting the house out,

28:17.278 --> 28:19.280
Todd and I will live together
in Clear River.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.991
It's got a huge yard and a big pool.

28:22.075 --> 28:25.870
My house will be ready within six months.
The kids won't even be walking by then.

28:25.954 --> 28:30.667
I'm just saying that
if you decide not to rebuild or whatever,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.586
you can visit the twins whenever you want.

28:35.004 --> 28:35.880
Visit?

28:35.964 --> 28:39.134
Yeah, and Todd says we don't even need
a formal custody agreement.

28:39.217 --> 28:42.846
We can have an open-door policy,
and you can come and go as you please.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.389
Within reason, of course.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.141
[cell phone vibrates]

28:46.224 --> 28:47.100
Oh.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.602
Oh, that's… that's Todd, um…

28:50.645 --> 28:51.479
I should go.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.815
Thank you so much for the 7 Up.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.652
[Charmaine] Hey! Yeah! [laughs]

28:57.736 --> 28:58.737
[door opens]

29:05.285 --> 29:07.162
You're all heart, Wilbur.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.123
-And I want you to know something.
-[Wilbur] What is it, Ed?

29:10.206 --> 29:14.335
[Ed] If I should go first,
everything I own goes to you.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.712
[Wilbur] That's kind of you,

29:15.795 --> 29:18.089
but I'll look silly
with horseshoes and a saddle.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.924
-[laughter on TV]
-[Ed] I wish I could…

29:20.008 --> 29:23.136
Jeez, did you go all the way back
to Virgin River for ice?

29:23.219 --> 29:24.888
-We need to leave.
-We just got here.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.307
-I saw Charlie in the parking lot.
-Who's Charlie?

29:27.390 --> 29:29.893
You know, Charlie, gray hair,
hangs out at Jack's?

29:29.976 --> 29:31.603
-That really old guy?
-Yeah.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.689
You know the desk clerk?
That's his nephew.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.941
[scoffs] I mean, what are the chances?

29:37.025 --> 29:38.818
In a place like this? Pretty high.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.488
-Charlie knows everyone.
-So?

29:41.571 --> 29:45.158
So he could tell Connie we're here.
Paul could tell someone who knows Connie.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.660
-Who's Paul?
-The guy who checked us in.

29:47.744 --> 29:52.540
That guy doesn't care what we're doing,
and Charlie is, like, 100.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.793
I'll bet he's already forgotten
he even saw you.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.461
Hey.

29:57.045 --> 30:00.423
We are in this amazing cabin all alone.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.508
I know.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.093
So we shouldn't
waste any time talking, okay?

30:05.678 --> 30:08.014
I'm sorry.
I can't stop thinking about Connie.

30:08.097 --> 30:10.266
Would you rather
think about Connie than me?

30:10.850 --> 30:11.935
Of course not.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.061
Okay, then.

30:15.772 --> 30:16.648
Does this help?

30:17.315 --> 30:18.691
Uh, yeah.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.235
How about another one?

30:21.277 --> 30:24.405
-Yeah, that's much better.
-Okay, then. [giggles]

30:31.162 --> 30:32.956
[drink pouring]

30:35.291 --> 30:37.043
[keypad beeps]

30:38.044 --> 30:39.045
[phone line ringing]

30:39.671 --> 30:42.924
-[operator] Your call has been forwarded…
-[sighs heavily]

30:47.095 --> 30:48.388
-[phone beeps]
-[tapping]

30:49.806 --> 30:50.974
[exhales deeply]

30:56.271 --> 30:57.856
-[Mel] Hey there.
-[Doc] Hey.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.942
What?
Did I forget something at the office?

31:01.025 --> 31:05.738
No. I was in the mood to play cards,
and Jack's busy. So…

31:06.364 --> 31:08.283
You know, I'm just really not up for--

31:08.366 --> 31:10.827
Just one game. Just one.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.579
[chuckles]

31:13.746 --> 31:15.748
-Okay.
-Okay. Great.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.334
[Doc sighs]

31:20.086 --> 31:21.421
What are we playin'?

31:22.046 --> 31:23.006
Go Fish.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.300
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.135
It's the only game I know how to play.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.178
This is obviously about Hope.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.056
No, I just felt like playing cards.

31:33.641 --> 31:37.437
Well, I still haven't heard from her
if that's… what you want to know.

31:40.356 --> 31:41.399
Have you seen the news?

31:41.482 --> 31:44.861
Yeah, hurricane made landfall
about an hour ago, and, uh…

31:45.612 --> 31:48.656
[exhales] That footage was so bad.
I just had to turn it off.

31:48.740 --> 31:52.118
-[Doc sighs heavily]
-Well, watching won't help anyone.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.164
I'll go first.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.084
-Do you have a seven?
-You know, this is so silly.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.171
-Why don't I teach you to play Solitaire?
-Seven or no seven?

32:03.838 --> 32:05.214
-[Doc] Stubborn.
-Hm.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.591
Just like Hope.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.053
Go fish.

32:15.516 --> 32:18.186
If I could just get a hold of her,
I would be…

32:18.978 --> 32:19.854
I'd be fine.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.523
Have you tried the local police station?

32:23.316 --> 32:26.527
Yeah, the lines--
Phone lines are all jammed.

32:27.403 --> 32:29.322
Seems like there's nothing else
you can do.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.824
I know, I know, it's… [inhales]

32:31.908 --> 32:33.159
…driving me crazy.

32:33.743 --> 32:34.827
Course it is.

32:39.082 --> 32:39.999
[sighs]

32:42.085 --> 32:43.461
Do you have a nine?

32:44.504 --> 32:45.421
[groans quietly]

32:48.216 --> 32:52.136
Right now, the storm surge is at ten feet.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.138
-[Mel] Mm.
-[sighs]

32:54.222 --> 32:57.684
If they're still at that house,
the chances of drowning…

32:57.767 --> 33:00.144
What about rescue efforts?

33:00.228 --> 33:04.482
Impossible. The wind's clocking in
over 100 miles an hour.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.402
[sighs heavily]

33:10.238 --> 33:11.114
You have a king?

33:14.242 --> 33:15.118
Go fish.

33:22.625 --> 33:23.543
[inhales]

33:27.672 --> 33:28.673
[sobs]

33:32.927 --> 33:33.928
[sniffles]

33:34.554 --> 33:35.930
I can't lose her.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.476
She is everything to me.

33:40.560 --> 33:41.602
[Mel] I know.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.146
-[sighs]
-[Mel] I know.

33:43.938 --> 33:46.190
And I know how hard it is to wait.

33:47.233 --> 33:49.902
[Doc breathes heavily]

33:51.320 --> 33:54.866
Mark was in surgery for three hours
before he passed away.

33:59.370 --> 34:03.082
The not knowing was unbearable.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.253
So I understand
the kind of pain that you're in.

34:10.423 --> 34:11.841
And you lost him anyway.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.509
No. No, no.

34:13.593 --> 34:17.096
That was my story. It does not mean
that it's gonna happen to you.

34:17.680 --> 34:20.141
-Yet it could.
-[Mel] Yes, it could.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.602
But for now, you still have hope.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.772
[laughing]

34:25.855 --> 34:27.148
Sorry.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.775
[laughing]

34:28.858 --> 34:30.026
That was so bad.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.820
I apologize.
That was completely unplanned.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.238
-[Doc groans]
-[Mel laughs]

34:34.864 --> 34:35.990
[Mel chuckles]

34:36.699 --> 34:39.786
Thank you. Thank you for coming over.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.746
-Of course.
-[Doc sighs]

34:41.829 --> 34:44.373
I just want you to know
that you're not alone in this.

34:50.922 --> 34:51.756
[sniffles]

34:59.889 --> 35:01.474
[Connie] We're up to about ten.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.520
-[Connie] Oh!
-[Christopher] Got one?

35:05.603 --> 35:07.021
-[Connie] I got three.
-Hey.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.398
What are you guys up to?

35:09.482 --> 35:11.734
[chuckles] Preach,
I got bugs living in my hair!

35:11.818 --> 35:14.946
-What?
-There's been a lice incident at camp.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.031
-Didn't you see the email?
-No, I didn't.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.783
So… so, how bad is it?

35:18.866 --> 35:20.618
Well, I've stripped the beds

35:20.701 --> 35:23.371
and washed all the towels
and Christopher's clothing.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.457
When I'm done with his hair,
I'm gonna start in on your closet.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.708
No, Connie, thanks.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.670

I told you I have a few things at the bar.
