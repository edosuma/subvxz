a special place for it.

at Chauncey Cheddar.

the cash until the day."

emergency.

You RSVP'd "No" and left me
to do the thing all alone.

Because "No" was
the obvious choice.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.612

09:38.344 --> 09:40.413
so I would like for
you to run the plates.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.815
Suspicious because
it was parked outside

09:41.815 --> 09:43.049
of your girlfriend's house?

09:43.049 --> 09:45.752
And it drove by twice. Okay?
Plus, I've got, like, the whole

09:45.752 --> 09:48.521
you know, gut instinct
thing happening, so...
Wait.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.324
It was reported stolen
two weeks ago.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.226
I'm‐I'm sorry.
What was that?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.628
It was reported stolen
two weeks ago.

09:55.628 --> 09:56.796
Yes. See? Instinct.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.165
All right, put a protective tail
on Molly.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.234
A tail?
You don't want to do that.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.436
Why not?

10:03.436 --> 10:06.339
Because she's your girlfriend,
and I actually like Molly.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.440
(snaps fingers)
Tail it.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.741
How about you discuss it?

10:08.741 --> 10:11.845
No! I worry
so she doesn't have to, okay?

10:11.845 --> 10:13.346
Tail. Now.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.348
Okay. (whistles)

10:15.348 --> 10:17.684
Everybody, call off...

10:17.684 --> 10:21.521
Call off the hounds,
stop the clock.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.190
Mystery is solved. (cries)

10:24.190 --> 10:26.259
I found, uh, Nina.

10:28.828 --> 10:32.799
She's with her ex, uh, Victor,
at his fight club.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.737
And how do you know that, Leo?

10:37.737 --> 10:39.472
Because I feel

10:39.472 --> 10:43.309
like my heart has been
ripped out by jackals.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.279
And I traced her phone.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.947
You have her password?

10:47.947 --> 10:49.816
I have all
of her passwords.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.485
Our entire relationship
was about transparency.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.787
Hey, text me the address
of that club, would you?

10:54.787 --> 10:56.723
Hey, the case is closed.
Why do you need the address?

10:56.723 --> 10:59.225
Because I have to arrest her
for murder.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.327
The whole shoe, head, right?

11:02.228 --> 11:03.796
(snorting sob)

11:03.796 --> 11:06.232
I'm ok... (crying):
Don't look at me.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.301
Don't even look at me.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.171
MURTAUGH:
<i>2036.</i>

11:11.171 --> 11:12.705
What?
This kid that I'm having.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.874
Uh‐huh.
That's the year
they graduate.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.075
2036.

11:16.075 --> 11:19.145
Well, upside, you can get 'em
a hoverboard for graduation.

11:19.145 --> 11:20.313
I'll be 70.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.683
74 by the time he
or she graduates college.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.152
(laughing)
And by the time
I'm walking he or she...

11:26.152 --> 11:27.120
What are you laughing...

11:27.120 --> 11:29.455
Look, Rog, you're never
gonna make it to 74.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.457
You got nothing to
worry about, pal.

11:31.457 --> 11:34.160
Good news, we're
in the right spot.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.461

Ah. I certainly
hope so. Otherwise,

11:55.448 --> 11:56.816
this place sucks.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.351
We got a problem here?

11:58.351 --> 11:59.752
I don't know. Maybe.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.322
Let me guess. Victor Ivanov.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.690
Can I call you Vic?

12:03.690 --> 12:05.158
Or do you hate that?

12:05.158 --> 12:06.259
Vic.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.694
We're looking for
Nina. Is she here?

12:07.694 --> 12:10.230
No, she's not here.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.898
So why don't you
get the hell out.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.666
Well, the problem is,

12:13.666 --> 12:16.135
her phone is here
and her car's out front.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.670
So you mind if we,
uh, look around?

12:17.670 --> 12:18.371
VICTOR:
Yeah.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.440
I mind if you look around. Also,

12:20.440 --> 12:22.208
get the hell out.
I know.
We heard you the first time.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.244
So, are you
always like this

12:24.244 --> 12:25.578
or just 'cause my partner
called you Vic?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.180
Hey. Riggs.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.618
Oh. Whose lovely
wedding dress with blood

12:31.618 --> 12:33.386
all over it?
That's mine.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.754
Yours? I don't know.
Oh, come on.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.755
Maybe 125 pounds ago.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.758
Yeah, that's not
gonna fit you.
LEO: Victor

12:38.758 --> 12:41.394
Ivanov!

12:41.394 --> 12:44.163
I'm here to fight
for my bride!

12:44.163 --> 12:45.932
Nina!
Who the hell is this?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.867
Leo, what are you doing?
LEO: "Who the hell is this?"

12:47.867 --> 12:49.769
(chuckles):
Oh.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.204
I am a man

12:51.204 --> 12:52.705
with a certain set
of skills.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.574
And you...

12:54.574 --> 12:56.576
Oh, my God.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.278
Her dress.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.646
You killed her!

12:59.646 --> 13:01.848
(yelling)

13:01.848 --> 13:03.616
You think we
should get involved?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.717
(grunting)

13:04.717 --> 13:07.353
Eh, I don't know. Let's
kind of see how it plays out.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.321
(grunting)
Might end up

13:08.321 --> 13:09.522
being self‐correcting.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.190
(grunting)

13:13.626 --> 13:14.861
All right.

13:14.861 --> 13:15.728
Now we get involved.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.596
Oh!

13:16.596 --> 13:17.563
(gunfire)

13:18.865 --> 13:20.633
(grunting)

13:20.633 --> 13:21.734
(groans)

13:25.338 --> 13:27.206
(gasps, grunting)

13:27.206 --> 13:28.341

13:34.213 --> 13:36.349

13:37.650 --> 13:38.685
(grunts)

13:38.685 --> 13:40.486
(gasping)

13:40.486 --> 13:41.654
Nina!

13:41.654 --> 13:42.322
You're alive?!

13:42.322 --> 13:44.290
I'm standing here, aren't I?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.266
RIGGS:
Hey!

13:53.266 --> 13:56.235
What do you guys say
we call a draw?!

13:59.672 --> 14:01.140
(gunfire)

14:01.140 --> 14:03.109
They never want to call it
a draw!

14:03.109 --> 14:04.310
I thought that you'd ditched me!

14:04.310 --> 14:06.713
How dare you think that.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.716
The‐the passport

14:09.716 --> 14:11.617
and the plane ticket.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.820
(grunting)

14:13.820 --> 14:16.356
Two passports, two tickets.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.858
You said you'd go to the
ends of the earth for me.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.693
I'm so sorry, my <i>chicle!</i>

14:20.693 --> 14:22.228
Oh!

14:22.228 --> 14:23.563
(grunting)

14:28.601 --> 14:29.602
Hey, you ready?

14:29.602 --> 14:31.371
Yep!

14:33.206 --> 14:35.308
(men shouting)

14:36.542 --> 14:37.810
(grunting)

14:38.911 --> 14:40.713
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:40.713 --> 14:41.714
Where you guys going?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.783
Tierra del Fuego.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.753
Yeah, I think we're gonna need
to make a stop first.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.330
Leo, it's been 20 minutes, and
your client's still not talking.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.232
Mm, the guy can read a clock.
He's gifted.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.366
Oh, look at that.
She's talking now.

15:00.366 --> 15:01.367
Not to him, I'm not.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.435
LEO:
Okay, um,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.771
my client, as I said,
is a smidge uncomfortable

15:04.771 --> 15:06.706
around law enforcement,
so she may need a moment

15:06.706 --> 15:07.707
to get comfortable.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.575
Well, I need an explanation

15:09.575 --> 15:11.577
about the dead guy in your house

15:11.577 --> 15:13.146
and the kilo in your bag.

15:13.146 --> 15:15.214
Leo, you remember
what I told my cousin Susie

15:15.214 --> 15:16.582
at the wedding
that one time?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.251
That she
could take a...

15:18.251 --> 15:19.185
(whispers)

15:19.185 --> 15:20.720
...and stuff it into a...

15:20.720 --> 15:22.155
(whispers)

15:22.155 --> 15:23.256
...and call it a hat trick?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.857
Okay, but I can't
say that to Roger,

15:24.857 --> 15:26.626
because Roger was the
best man at our wedding.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.827
I wasn't your best man.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.762
The people who
you surround yourself with

15:29.762 --> 15:31.431
are a reflection
of who you are, Leo.
(sighs)

15:31.431 --> 15:32.799
Remember that.
You remember that.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.267
You remember that.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.368
You're tearing me

15:35.368 --> 15:36.335
apart here.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.136
Baby, tell Ro...

15:37.136 --> 15:39.505
tell Roger your version
of events.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.741
(whispers):
For me.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.209
For you?

15:43.209 --> 15:44.544
Please.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.812
(sighs)

15:45.812 --> 15:48.548
I wait tables at an
underground poker game.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.251
The kind where you can use
anything as collateral‐‐ cash,

15:52.251 --> 15:53.853
art, jewelry...
Drugs.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.021
Wow, your best man's a genius.

15:55.021 --> 15:57.557
All the connections
he makes.
I'm not the best man.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.258
Careful. Yes.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.694
The night before the wedding,

16:01.694 --> 16:04.697
two players got into a fight

16:04.697 --> 16:07.633
and a bag fell in my lap.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.735
Inside was collateral.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.471
You stole the cocaine.
Leo,

16:11.471 --> 16:13.206
he's twisting my words.
Let the record state

16:13.206 --> 16:14.774
that my client borrowed

16:14.774 --> 16:17.109
an unknown substance.
Mm‐hmm.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.110
She is no
laboratory.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.680
Borrowed from whom?

16:21.614 --> 16:22.648
Jimmy Lee.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.150
(scoffs, whimpers)

16:24.150 --> 16:25.852
Jimmy‐Jimmy Lee, the gangster?

16:25.852 --> 16:26.853
Well, I figured
he wouldn't notice.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.888
(groaning)
And he figured
out it was you,

16:28.888 --> 16:29.889
so he sent a killer.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.358
And then you took out the killer
with your shoe.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.659
Baby, baby.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.861
<i>Chicle,</i> why?

16:34.861 --> 16:37.663
Why did you steal cocaine
the night before our wedding?

16:37.663 --> 16:38.898
For us.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.367
I saw your bank account,
and 28 bucks

16:41.367 --> 16:43.302
ain't gonna last long.
I had a lot of...

16:43.302 --> 16:45.771
I had a lot of money in Pets.com
early and then Bitcoin.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.573
And currently...
Oh, don't you do that.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.308
Don't you sell yourself short.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.644
This man may not be rich
in cash, but he is

16:51.644 --> 16:53.279
rich in his words.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.514
And he moves me.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.783
I sold the coke to get enough
to start our life together.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.520
(crying)

17:00.520 --> 17:02.588
See that, Detective?

17:02.588 --> 17:04.590
This is a crime of love.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.592
Of passion.
Mm‐hmm.

17:06.592 --> 17:07.593
Allegedly.

17:07.593 --> 17:09.295
(moaning)
Hey. Hey.

17:09.295 --> 17:10.129
Hey, hey, hey!

17:10.129 --> 17:11.631
There's cameras in here.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.165
Get me the tape.
Can you get me...

17:13.165 --> 17:14.600
You have access
to the tape, yeah?

17:14.600 --> 17:16.636
BAILEY:
<i>Hey, so,</i>

17:16.636 --> 17:18.738
I got a update on that uni that
was trailing your girlfriend.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.806
She didn't go
to Chauncey Cheddar.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.742
What do you mean she never went?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.744
She was at
a supermarket parking lot

17:24.744 --> 17:27.313
with that stolen Trans Am.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.750
Did we find out
who's in the vehicle?

17:31.651 --> 17:32.518
Uni didn't get a look.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.120
But, apparently,
there was a conversation

17:34.120 --> 17:35.354
and then the car took off.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.124
I'm gonna call her.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.058
Wait, wait.
You're not gonna call

17:39.058 --> 17:41.761
Molly about
a secret surveillance of Molly.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.929
That's a bad idea.

17:42.929 --> 17:46.699
See, this is why you know
nothing about relationships.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.371
(phone ringing)

17:56.375 --> 17:57.476
(beep)

17:57.476 --> 17:58.678
Oh, hey.

17:58.678 --> 17:59.679
Everything all right?

17:59.679 --> 18:02.114
Yeah! Yeah. I was just, uh,

18:02.114 --> 18:04.850
you know, curious
how the festivities down at

18:04.850 --> 18:06.252
Chauncey Cheddar were going.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.621
Oh, that. Uh...

18:08.621 --> 18:11.190
We didn't end up going.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.358
Oh.

18:12.358 --> 18:13.693
Capacity issue?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.596
Actually, yeah, it was that.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.797
Booked solid.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.432
Everybody loves Chauncey.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.733
Of course they do.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.603
So, uh,
what'd you guys do instead?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.839
Check out a movie or, uh...

18:26.839 --> 18:30.876
maybe meet up with an old friend
in a parking lot?

18:30.876 --> 18:34.280
How do you know
I was in a parking lot?

18:35.348 --> 18:36.749
Oh, my God, Riggs.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.750
Are you following me?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.620
No, I was not, okay? Um...

18:40.620 --> 18:45.191
But, you know, I may have put
a protective tail on you, yes.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.125
A tail?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.294
Why the hell would you put
a tail on me?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.663
Look, because I was worried
about you, okay? It...

18:50.663 --> 18:52.832
Because it's...

18:52.832 --> 18:55.468
Uh, affection
is what I was showing you.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.569
Affection?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.904
It's a violation.

18:58.904 --> 18:59.772
Suddenly, you don't trust me?

18:59.772 --> 19:02.174
What? (chuckles)
Of course I trust you.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.677
Ask Bailey. Bailey will say...
Bailey?

19:04.677 --> 19:06.712
Bailey knows about this?
Who else?

19:09.115 --> 19:12.318
Well, you know, I mean,
the uni that was following you.

19:12.318 --> 19:16.088
Um, there was this lady
from Dispatch that...
(click)

19:16.789 --> 19:19.191
She‐she hung up on you?

19:19.191 --> 19:20.793
Yeah, she hung up.
(clears throat)

19:20.793 --> 19:22.261
Yeah. Figured that.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.429
Go away, please.

19:23.429 --> 19:26.699
Nope. Because I have
an update on the case.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.301
There's a poker game
today at Hu's Laundry

19:29.301 --> 19:30.202

Yeah.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.725
Yeah, I just, uh...

21:32.725 --> 21:35.194
got punched in the gut.

21:40.866 --> 21:43.606
Hey, Cap. Got a sec?
You know that, uh,

21:43.606 --> 21:45.708
paternity leave
situation we have?

21:45.708 --> 21:48.811
No way. You guys
are pregnant again?

21:48.811 --> 21:50.913
Trish must be
over the moon.

21:50.913 --> 21:53.516
Well, I haven't talked to her
about it yet, but I know

21:53.516 --> 21:55.584
because I found a test.

21:55.584 --> 21:57.186
But you know this
is good, right?

21:57.186 --> 21:59.722
Yeah, I mean, of course,
but, you know,

21:59.722 --> 22:01.357
we just got out of diaper duty.

22:01.357 --> 22:03.459
Now we have
to relive that again.

22:03.459 --> 22:05.628
Roger Murtaugh, in the 20‐plus
years that I've known you,

22:05.628 --> 22:07.096
the happiest
I have ever seen you

22:07.096 --> 22:08.430
were the days
your children were born.

22:09.799 --> 22:11.333
Really?

22:11.333 --> 22:13.769
Don't you think the world
will be a better place

22:13.769 --> 22:15.371
with another little Murtaugh
running around?

22:15.371 --> 22:17.506
(laughs)
We do have good genes.

22:17.506 --> 22:19.742
Yeah.
Thanks, Cap.

22:19.742 --> 22:22.111
I'm gonna get home
to Trish if that's it.

22:22.111 --> 22:24.847
Almost. So I saw that there's
a BOLO out for Jake Voss.

22:24.847 --> 22:26.849
Jake may have showed up
to the poker game.

22:26.849 --> 22:28.417
When were you
gonna tell me this?

22:28.417 --> 22:30.486
I‐I didn't think
it was my place.

22:30.486 --> 22:31.587
That's Riggs' friend.

22:31.587 --> 22:32.621
Well, I don't know
about "friend,"

22:32.621 --> 22:34.690
'cause Riggs is the one
that submitted the BOLO.

22:34.690 --> 22:37.827
Guess the situation changed.

22:37.827 --> 22:39.195
(oven dings)

22:45.534 --> 22:48.671
Son of a bitch.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.639
(sighs)

22:54.210 --> 22:56.278
It's the one thing Ben
asked for on his birthday,

22:56.278 --> 22:57.513
a chocolate soufflé,

22:57.513 --> 22:59.715
and they keep collapsing.
(laughs)

23:09.358 --> 23:10.826
You saw him?

23:10.826 --> 23:12.761
Briefly.

23:14.096 --> 23:16.098
Why didn't you tell me?

23:16.098 --> 23:17.399
Why do you think?

23:17.399 --> 23:18.601
Because you're a cop,

23:18.601 --> 23:20.603
Martin. He's a fugitive.

23:20.603 --> 23:22.137
Cops catch fugitives.

23:23.138 --> 23:25.608
Well, that's not how
it worked last time.

23:25.608 --> 23:26.809
You let him go.

23:26.809 --> 23:29.645
Maybe I didn't want
to put you or...

23:29.645 --> 23:33.115
put <i>us</i> in that
position again.

23:36.518 --> 23:37.853
But that's not
your call to make.

23:37.853 --> 23:40.623
When it is about
my son, it is.

23:40.623 --> 23:43.859
I gave Jake his ring back
and I made it clear:

23:43.859 --> 23:47.529
if he wants to see Ben again,
he can turn himself in.

23:51.634 --> 23:54.436
Did it occur to you
that maybe I should know

23:54.436 --> 23:55.738
that Jake's in Los Angeles?

23:55.738 --> 23:58.173
Oh, I don't know, Riggs,
did it occur to you

23:58.173 --> 24:01.577
that maybe you shouldn't have
had a damn cop follow me around?

24:03.846 --> 24:06.582
Listen, I was trying
to protect you.

24:06.582 --> 24:08.484
Oh, well, guess what. Me, too.

24:08.484 --> 24:09.618
How'd that turn out?

24:09.618 --> 24:12.554
You know what? We can try
to not mess this thing up

24:12.554 --> 24:14.690
as much as we want,
but in the end, it's...

24:14.690 --> 24:16.091

24:16.091 --> 24:18.394

24:18.394 --> 24:21.563

Where's he staying?

24:33.242 --> 24:36.045
A motel in Simi.

24:42.351 --> 24:45.054
Riggs.

24:45.788 --> 24:48.190
(sighs)

24:48.190 --> 24:50.726
Do me a favor
and get rid of that.

<i>Hey, you.</i>

25:08.677 --> 25:10.245

with the briefs,

25:10.245 --> 25:12.448
you want to go
grab some dinner?

25:12.448 --> 25:15.184
Dinner can wait.

25:15.184 --> 25:18.387
How about some of this?

25:18.387 --> 25:20.789
Oh, okay.

25:20.789 --> 25:23.525
Mmm. This is
the Roger I like.

25:23.525 --> 25:24.626
Yeah, well,

25:24.626 --> 25:28.397
Trish, I want you to know
that... (clears throat)

25:28.397 --> 25:29.798
I'm all good with it.

25:29.798 --> 25:31.667
"It."

25:31.667 --> 25:34.036

25:35.504 --> 25:37.272

25:37.272 --> 25:41.543

I'm not pregnant.

25:41.543 --> 25:44.413
No?
No.

25:44.413 --> 25:46.682
Then why am I doing this?

25:46.682 --> 25:48.517
I was out chasing
bad guys all day.
Oh.

25:48.517 --> 25:49.551

25:49.551 --> 25:51.653

25:51.653 --> 25:53.355
Why would you think
I'm pregnant?

25:53.355 --> 25:56.625
I found a pregnancy test

25:56.625 --> 25:58.460

25:58.460 --> 26:00.162
Well, it's not mine.

26:00.162 --> 26:02.097

26:02.097 --> 26:04.166

26:04.166 --> 26:06.135

26:06.135 --> 26:07.403

26:07.403 --> 26:08.737

26:08.737 --> 26:12.274
Oh, please. You loved
building that crib.

26:12.274 --> 26:14.076
Ah, this is so great.

26:14.076 --> 26:18.247

29:27.502 --> 29:29.738
Okay. Maybe you don't
understand, Hopalong,

29:29.738 --> 29:33.308
this could be the last time
that Nina and I are alone

29:33.308 --> 29:36.078
for one to four years,
and we need a room

29:36.078 --> 29:38.180
to, uh, prepare legally.

29:38.180 --> 29:40.282
So...
Right, right.

29:40.282 --> 29:43.418
Leo, so help me God,

29:43.418 --> 29:45.387
if I don't get
a minute with her,

29:45.387 --> 29:47.222
you're never
gonna prepare again.

29:48.624 --> 29:50.192
Make it quick.
Quick. Go quick.
Yeah.

29:50.192 --> 29:51.760
Quick, quick.
I already took my‐‐

29:51.760 --> 29:52.694
the pill I was supposed to take.

29:54.162 --> 29:55.731
This business again?

29:55.731 --> 29:58.400
The sooner you answer him,
the sooner he's gone.

29:59.568 --> 30:00.702
Fine.

30:02.871 --> 30:07.109
It's an invitation to a monthly
card game for high rollers.

30:07.109 --> 30:08.810
$250,000 buy‐in.

30:08.810 --> 30:10.479
"Rochambeau"
is the password.

30:10.479 --> 30:12.114
Okay, wonderful. If that's
everything, uh, Detective.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.115
Then, honey, gum.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.249
Spit out the gum.

30:14.249 --> 30:15.717
You recognize this guy?

30:15.717 --> 30:17.719
He's a new player.

30:17.719 --> 30:18.820
Yeah. He‐he was there

30:18.820 --> 30:21.223
the‐the night those two idiots
got into that fight.

30:21.223 --> 30:23.125
Was he involved
in the fight?

30:23.125 --> 30:24.393
Oh, come on, don't sit.
He's sitting.

30:24.393 --> 30:26.528
Nah, he was hiding over by the
safe while the guards locked it.

30:26.528 --> 30:28.330
LEO:
Okay, seven minutes.

30:28.330 --> 30:29.765
Clothes are coming off,
that's it.

30:29.765 --> 30:32.134
Is it possible that he
could see the combination

30:32.134 --> 30:33.268
from where he was?

30:33.268 --> 30:34.770
It's possible.

30:34.770 --> 30:36.271
Shirt on, pants off.

30:36.271 --> 30:37.906
Sorry, Detective.

30:37.906 --> 30:39.775

30:39.775 --> 30:42.244
is... now.

30:42.244 --> 30:44.646

All right, look,
I need a list

30:44.646 --> 30:46.882

Mm‐hmm.

Ooh, ooh.

30:56.425 --> 30:57.759
Just text me the locations.

Shh, shh, shh.

Riana.

31:26.621 --> 31:29.257
Ah, that's a terrible joke,
Scorsese.

31:34.496 --> 31:35.697

Get back to the morgue.

31:35.697 --> 31:37.699
I could just...
Okay. Cool. Yeah.
Go back to the morgue.

31:37.699 --> 31:40.502
That was a well‐intentioned
prank. I'm so sorry.

31:40.502 --> 31:42.371
Not as sorry as I am.
BAILEY: Hey.

31:42.371 --> 31:43.905

that silly singles cruise

to get out of her system.

39:48.790 --> 39:53.528
A‐And now she's not drinking
caffeine or liquor?

39:53.528 --> 39:55.663
No raw fish or soft cheese,
either.

39:55.663 --> 39:57.365
She says it's good for her skin,

39:57.365 --> 39:59.300
and, wow, it is glowing.

39:59.300 --> 40:03.104

Hey. Psst.

40:40.475 --> 40:42.610
Have you seen a little monster
running around here with a...

40:42.610 --> 40:44.512
I know you're not about to say

40:44.512 --> 40:45.713
Nerf gun.

40:46.814 --> 40:48.149
No.

40:48.149 --> 40:50.418
I was not gonna say Nerf gun.
Uh‐huh.

40:50.418 --> 40:51.853
I was gonna say...

40:51.853 --> 40:53.454
the books

40:53.454 --> 40:55.356
that we were gonna read... Hey!

40:55.356 --> 40:56.524
I told you no guns in the house!

40:56.524 --> 40:57.525
This guy,

40:57.525 --> 40:59.727
he just...
Oh!

40:59.727 --> 41:01.663
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

41:01.663 --> 41:03.164
You did not.
I'm so sorry.

41:03.164 --> 41:04.299
I'm sorry.
Just...

41:04.299 --> 41:06.134
Oh, God. Okay.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Oh, my God.

41:06.134 --> 41:08.303
Riggs!
Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

41:08.303 --> 41:09.404
Okay, h‐hold on.
Should I just...

41:09.404 --> 41:10.605
lean?
Yep.

41:10.605 --> 41:12.373
Lean. Lean into it.
Lean into it.

41:12.373 --> 41:13.574
Oh.
Riggs.

41:13.574 --> 41:15.710
Oh. (laughs) Hold on.

41:15.710 --> 41:17.412
See, that's not that bad.

41:17.412 --> 41:19.113
(groans)
Look.

41:19.113 --> 41:21.182
(chuckles) It's
actually incredible.

41:21.182 --> 41:24.686
What?
Well, even when I think
I've got it handled,

41:24.686 --> 41:26.721
I make another mess.

41:26.721 --> 41:29.190
Hey. Well,
maybe that's our thing.

41:29.190 --> 41:32.260
Right? Maybe we‐we make
the best messes.

41:32.260 --> 41:34.128
Who's gonna beat us?

41:34.128 --> 41:35.730
Mmm, nobody.

Love is complicated.

41:45.506 --> 41:46.874
One day you're getting married

41:46.874 --> 41:49.477
at a reasonably priced
hotel by the airport,

41:49.477 --> 41:50.645
and the next,

41:50.645 --> 41:53.548
you're getting hitched
between felony cases

41:53.548 --> 41:55.450
before your wife
takes a little vacay...

41:55.450 --> 41:57.085
just a little vacay upstate.

41:58.786 --> 42:01.422
But no matter what the day,

42:01.422 --> 42:03.491
I would follow this woman...

to the end of the earth.

I have a full docket.

to this union, speak now

42:12.166 --> 42:13.434
or forever hold your peace.

42:13.434 --> 42:15.837
(whispering):
Don't you dare.

42:15.837 --> 42:19.540
So, by the power vested in me,

42:19.540 --> 42:21.209
I now pronounce you
