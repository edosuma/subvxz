17:55.291 --> 17:56.858
Uh, m-may... maybe not.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.034
You're <i>famous</i> here!

17:59.078 --> 18:00.438
We took another look
at your letter

18:00.470 --> 18:02.429
and realized you were right.

18:02.472 --> 18:05.867
Smashmouth football was the key
to our undefeated season.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.651
You listened to us?

18:07.695 --> 18:10.567
So... rampage over?

18:10.611 --> 18:13.483
But... no rampage.

18:13.527 --> 18:16.269
But Killdozer need to eat.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.009
Welp, I'll leave you to it,
then.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.360
Go, Sharks!

18:20.403 --> 18:22.144
ALL [weakly]: Go, Sharks.

18:22.188 --> 18:26.061
♪

18:26.105 --> 18:28.368
Wow, honey.
Check out Roger.

18:28.411 --> 18:29.867
You were skeptical
when he reached out,

18:29.891 --> 18:31.675
but he looks like a new man.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.547
Thank you all for coming.

18:33.590 --> 18:36.463
First, I'd like to give
a shout-out to my sponsor, Mark.

18:36.506 --> 18:40.684
30 days sober
thanks to that amazing human.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.252
I'd also like to acknowledge
Klaus Heisler over there.

18:43.296 --> 18:46.429
Klaus was my muse,
but I hurt him.

18:46.473 --> 18:49.519
I thought great art
came only from pain,

18:49.563 --> 18:52.261
but beauty isn't born
from misery alone.

18:52.305 --> 18:55.177
There's also
the wellspring of joy.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.005
You taught me that, Klaus.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.834
You continue to inspire me.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.009
Thank you.

19:01.052 --> 19:04.491
[applause]

19:04.534 --> 19:06.580
And now, art.

19:06.623 --> 19:09.800
Feast your eyes
on my greatest masterpiece...

19:09.844 --> 19:12.238
<i>Spaghetti Night!</i>

19:12.281 --> 19:13.543
- [crowd murmuring]
- Woof.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.589
This one's a dog.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.895
Oh, wow! <i>
Spaghetti Night!</i>

19:17.939 --> 19:19.723
Pretty awesome, right?

19:19.767 --> 19:21.551
The eyes.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.901
- They're dead.
- They're meatballs!

19:23.945 --> 19:27.514
I think it's cool because
it's a statue of you... Dad.

19:27.557 --> 19:28.689
You're an imbecile, Brandon.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.560
Klaus!

19:30.604 --> 19:33.041
There's no depth, no pathos.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.956
It sucks!

19:34.999 --> 19:37.393
I'm not this corny-ass
Mr. Rogers.

19:37.437 --> 19:40.614
Uh-oh. That's a quarter
for the swear jar, Klaus.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.616
Here's 50 cents.
Go buy some new tits!

19:42.659 --> 19:44.226
Excuse me?!

19:44.270 --> 19:46.576
You did this to me!
We're finished!

19:46.620 --> 19:48.404
Brandon, why did you even
bring a football?!

19:48.448 --> 19:51.407
It's an art gallery!
I hate you!

19:51.451 --> 19:55.150
[sobbing]
I hate you!

19:55.194 --> 19:57.413
I hate myself!

19:57.457 --> 19:59.807
[sobs]

19:59.850 --> 20:01.243
There he is!

20:01.287 --> 20:03.027
There's the Klaus I know
and love!

20:03.071 --> 20:04.203
I <i>knew</i> the misery

20:04.246 --> 20:05.595
was still inside you!

20:05.639 --> 20:07.380
You obviously didn't know when

20:07.423 --> 20:08.990
you squeezed out <i>this</i> turd.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.600
Oh, didn't I?

20:13.821 --> 20:16.432
[gasps] It's me.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.347
The <i>real</i> me.

20:18.391 --> 20:19.783
Thank you, Roger.

20:19.827 --> 20:24.092
I am your muse, now and forever.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.486
Yes!
We're back, old friend!

20:26.529 --> 20:28.227
But about that...
we're not back.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.794
I've given up art
to follow my true passion...

20:30.838 --> 20:31.839
doing heroin.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.233
We're back, old friend!

20:36.060 --> 20:37.453
Denise?

20:37.497 --> 20:39.063
Ah, she headed out.

20:40.282 --> 20:41.892
Dad, this was a great idea.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.242
Well, it would have been a shame

20:43.285 --> 20:45.113
making the thousand-mile
journey home

20:45.156 --> 20:46.636
without rampaging something.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.944
Feast, Killdozer!
Feast!

20:52.468 --> 20:54.122
Why?

20:54.165 --> 20:55.732
Then again, why not?

20:57.081 --> 20:58.387
Have a great night!
