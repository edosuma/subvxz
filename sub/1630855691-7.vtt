WEBVTT

00:43.418 --> 00:44.377
Hey, Granny!

00:44.461 --> 00:48.006
Oh my!
Why are you waiting outside? It's hot!

00:48.715 --> 00:51.801
I bought some snacks
and new clothes for you.

00:52.677 --> 00:55.138
-Let's go in. Are you hungry?
-Yes, I am.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.742
-Why are you acting up again?
-Mo-mi, stop it!

01:16.242 --> 01:19.454
That woman from earlier,
she'll commit murder.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.289
This is your final warning!

01:21.372 --> 01:24.000
If you do this again,
we'll be forced to take action.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.711
Hey, c'mon. That's enough!

01:27.295 --> 01:29.089
Please! Stop her!

03:07.854 --> 03:12.692
MASK GIRL

03:13.860 --> 03:17.864
MO-MI AND MI-MO

03:20.533 --> 03:22.994
Wow. This jeotgal is really good.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.831
I'm surprised
you like it. Kids usually don't.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.960
You know, I stored it underground
for a long time.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.838
Wow. "Underground"?
Maybe that's why it's good.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.052
She… really said that to you?

03:42.180 --> 03:43.097
Hmm.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.976
Honey… don't worry about it.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.812
I'll try to get some people
to look into that woman.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.441
It might… take a little while
to find where she is,

03:53.524 --> 03:55.860
so first I'll get information
on your mother and daughter,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.321
and then I'll update you
as soon as I have news.

03:59.113 --> 04:02.867
You should at least
give your grandmother a call, right?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.119
My grandma's…

04:06.704 --> 04:08.164
probably happy that I'm gone.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.124
Grandmas don't think that.

04:10.750 --> 04:15.296
Hmm? She must feel bad
because you left home and abandoned her.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.425
If you want to stay with me,
then you need to call

04:19.509 --> 04:21.052
and tell her you're all right.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.598
Don't tell her
you're staying with me specifically.

04:27.767 --> 04:28.643
Okay, fine.

04:28.726 --> 04:29.560
Good.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.235
And who is that?

04:38.736 --> 04:40.697
Is that your son? In that picture?

04:43.992 --> 04:44.826
Yes.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.954
Oh, awesome. I didn't know you had a son.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.167
He's not here anymore.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.337
He's far away.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.100
Ms. An told me
to give this to you.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.029
YEONG-HUI SHIN
010-544-1942

05:25.325 --> 05:28.286
MISSING PERSONS REPORT

05:28.369 --> 05:31.122
By the way, I'm sorry to ask this,

05:31.205 --> 05:34.459
but is this the first time she,
uh, has run away from home?

05:34.959 --> 05:39.714
Oh, she's done it once or twice,
but, uh, she always comes back, so…

05:41.924 --> 05:45.595
Well, uh, why don't you try
waiting for her a little longer?

05:45.678 --> 05:47.805
There's a high chance she'll return soon.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.265
Oh.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.660
Oh.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.205
Oh God! Mi-mo!

06:12.288 --> 06:13.498
Where are you?

06:14.374 --> 06:15.875
I'm doing all right.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.628
So don't look for me.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.178
-And don't report me as missing.
-But w-- wait!

06:28.388 --> 06:30.473
Living with me
is just a nuisance to you, anyway.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.225
That is not true!

06:32.308 --> 06:33.976
You said I made you uncomfortable

06:34.977 --> 06:36.312
and reminded you of her.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.607
The kids at school hate me too.

06:41.067 --> 06:45.029
When I think about it, everything
will be fine if I just disappear, right?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.364
Uh, but Mi-mo, wait.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.783
Wh-- What-- What are you talking about?

06:48.866 --> 06:50.076
I won't call you again.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.037
W-- Wait. Hello? Mi-mo--

06:53.121 --> 06:54.747
GRANDMOTHER

06:54.831 --> 06:55.665
POWER OFF

06:57.750 --> 06:59.502
What?!

07:00.837 --> 07:01.879
Uh-- Uh-- Hello?

07:03.005 --> 07:03.923
It's Mo-mi.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.718
How on earth…

07:08.511 --> 07:10.096
Is Mi-mo doing well?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.266
You're asking about Mi-mo after so long?

07:14.183 --> 07:15.184
Mi-mo's fine!

07:15.977 --> 07:16.811
Ma,

07:17.645 --> 07:20.898
did Mi-mo ever mention a… an older woman?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.359
A lady she… met at school?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.402
No, she didn't.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.530
I don't know how
you managed to get my number,

07:27.613 --> 07:30.616
but if you care about Mi-mo,
then don't ever call me again.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.160
Mom… listen!

07:33.411 --> 07:34.245
Hello?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.289
Hello?!

07:40.501 --> 07:43.087
Number 1047,
your time is up. Come out.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.257
Number 1047, come out now!

07:46.340 --> 07:47.800
Come out right now.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.595
Come out right now!

07:50.678 --> 07:53.806
-Wait. I just need to make one more call.
-You can't! Come out right now!

07:53.890 --> 07:56.684
-I need to make one more call!
-Get out of the booth right now!

07:56.767 --> 08:00.062
-I just need to make one more!
-Out right now! Hold her!

08:00.146 --> 08:03.858
Hold her down!
Don't move. Stay still. Stay still!

08:06.444 --> 08:09.572
Honey… did you make a scene
in the phone room?

08:12.867 --> 08:15.620
First, that incident
with the woman last time,

08:15.703 --> 08:17.830
and now this one…

08:17.914 --> 08:20.750
You know, I barely managed
to convince the warden not to…

08:20.833 --> 08:22.210
not to put you in the hole?

08:23.002 --> 08:23.920
I'm sorry.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.964
She did say
they're restricting your access

08:27.048 --> 08:28.883
to the phones for two weeks, though.

08:30.718 --> 08:31.552
Ah!

08:32.220 --> 08:34.847
Also, I'm looking into that woman already.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.225
She changed her name,
so it's taking me a while.

08:40.978 --> 08:43.731
I found the…
school that Mi-mo is currently going to.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.194
If you want, call and check for yourself.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.447
I will put in a good word for you
with the chief warden.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.949
One call should be fine.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.660
Hello?

08:55.743 --> 08:58.204
Hello, um,
is this Seongrim Middle School?

08:58.287 --> 08:59.288
Yes, that's correct.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.084
Okay, could I speak… with Mi-mo Kim?

09:05.002 --> 09:07.964
She's a seventh grader.
I really need to tell her something.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.800
Oh… One moment, please.

09:43.624 --> 09:44.500
Hello?

09:46.961 --> 09:50.256
Number 1047,
your time is up. Come out.

09:51.090 --> 09:51.924
Hello?

09:59.056 --> 10:00.474
The call disconnected.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.351
Good job.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.316
Bye! I'll see ya.

10:08.816 --> 10:09.650
Uh-huh.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.069
Mmm. Mmm!

10:12.695 --> 10:14.864
Oh! The tomato is so good.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.325
Crop harvest is good this year.

10:17.408 --> 10:21.621
You know, I look for the sweeter ones,
and I put them aside just for you!

10:22.747 --> 10:25.249
Aren't they tasty?
Have as much as you'd like.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.335
We're so glad you're enjoying them, right?

10:27.418 --> 10:30.004
Have some, have some! C'mon!

10:30.087 --> 10:31.213
Go on, try some.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.052
By the way,
why does Mask Girl look so miserable?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.058
How was it? Could you reach the school?

10:42.141 --> 10:43.142
Yeah.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.770
Ma'am, um, do you think,

10:46.687 --> 10:51.859
maybe I could get, you know,
some… pictures of Mi-mo going to school?

10:52.401 --> 10:53.444
You want pictures?

10:54.195 --> 10:55.029
Ah!

10:56.447 --> 10:59.992
Just get a kid around her age,
in a school uniform,

11:00.076 --> 11:02.203
and take a picture in front of the school.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.999
Of course not,
she just has to look similar enough.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.709
Not a mirror image of the girl.

11:09.919 --> 11:10.753
Listen,

11:11.671 --> 11:15.257
this woman hasn't seen her girl for years,
she'll never tell them apart.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.679
Oof.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.683
Ah, Jesus. It's all crooked.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.187
I think they took it
from a distance

11:28.270 --> 11:30.564
'cause, um, getting too close
would be weird.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.442
Thank you so much.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.860
This makes me feel better.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.572
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.910
You should feel relaxed.
After all, the surgery's tomorrow.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.453
Isn't that right?

11:47.665 --> 11:50.710
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
this is the lowest we can go.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.838
Our prices are fixed,
so unfortunately, I'm really--

11:53.921 --> 11:56.507
Hey, hey. I'm paying in cash.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.009
So give me a discount.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.511
Here.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.848
Do we have a deal?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.813
QUICK GRILL BRIQUETTE

12:13.733 --> 12:14.775
How much is it?

12:14.859 --> 12:18.195
-9,700 won. Would you like a bag?
-No, it's fine.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.781
Here. Put it here.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.366
Mm-hmm.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.392
Mi-mo!

12:48.976 --> 12:49.852
I'm back!

12:52.438 --> 12:53.731
Are you sleeping?

13:05.409 --> 13:07.203
Shit.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.342
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

13:21.425 --> 13:24.345
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

13:24.845 --> 13:27.598
♪ Happy birthday, dear Granny ♪

13:27.681 --> 13:29.892
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

13:29.975 --> 13:31.018
-Whoo!
-Oh…

13:31.769 --> 13:32.978
Is it my birthday?

13:33.646 --> 13:34.688
I didn't know.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.567
How did you know it's… today?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.319
I saw your ID in a drawer.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.365
-Granny?
-Huh?

13:44.448 --> 13:47.368
-Blow the candle out.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure. Um…

13:52.248 --> 13:53.290
Granny,

13:54.333 --> 13:55.876
I consider you my real

13:56.877 --> 13:57.711
grandmother.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.465
So you have to live long.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.680
Sure.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.353
Number 1047, hospital transport.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.526
I wish you the best of luck.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.547
You look so different in that!

16:47.464 --> 16:49.633
-Don't you think so? Huh?
-Mmm.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.177
You know, I bought these for her.

16:52.845 --> 16:53.679
Ah!

16:54.471 --> 16:56.765
You look pretty in a skirt.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.143
Right? Are you happy right now?

16:59.226 --> 17:01.854
-Yes, I'm thankful for these clothes.
-Mmm.

17:01.937 --> 17:07.026
Okay, so… no one outside of this facility
knows about the surgery.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.737
So you'll have to behave
at the hospital, understood?

17:10.529 --> 17:11.739
I understand, ma'am.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.157
Very good.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.618
God will be with you, Mo-mi.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.465
If anything happens,
make sure to let us know.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.382
Yes, ma'am.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.263
You ready to go?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.057
Yep.

18:01.705 --> 18:04.166
Let's eat! Mi-mo, dear!

18:05.626 --> 18:07.961
Wow! Granny, that's a lot of food.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.298
Ah, I guess. There's a lot indeed.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.674
-So eat up.
-Okay.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.012
I think, um,

18:17.721 --> 18:19.223
I should… get a job, you know?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.183
You?

18:22.726 --> 18:24.144
What do you need a job for?

18:24.228 --> 18:28.065
Well, to, um… to send you on trips
and buy you clothes

18:28.148 --> 18:29.691
and good food, of course.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.361
I'll make sure
you live a long and happy life.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.615
What's wrong?

18:37.825 --> 18:41.078
Oh… nothing's wrong.
Oh, uh, eat your food.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.956
Your soup's getting cold.

18:50.129 --> 18:50.963
Mmm.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.966
Wow. This soup is good.

19:00.472 --> 19:04.226
-How may I help you, ma'am?
-I just wanted to ask you something.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.395
Do you know that lady at our church,

19:06.478 --> 19:08.772
the one who's close to Mi-mo
and sells tteokbokki?

19:08.856 --> 19:10.232
Do you mean Ms. Nam?

19:10.315 --> 19:14.653
Yes, her. Uh, would you mind,
uh, giving me her number?

19:14.736 --> 19:17.364
Uh, and her address if you have it.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.449
-Oh. Uh, well… Uh…
-Oh…

19:19.533 --> 19:22.161
She came by my house
and prayed for us the other day,

19:22.244 --> 19:24.580
so I wanted to send her a thank-you gift.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.416
-Oh! I see. One moment, please.
-Oh sure.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.087
We just got to the hospital.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.799
Yeah. Uh, yes, ma'am.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.719
Here you are, your hospital gown.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.554
When is the surgery?

19:40.637 --> 19:43.015
We'll begin as soon as
the blood test is complete.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.558
Okay, perfect.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.907
Do you think I, um,
could get a Bible if that's okay?

20:00.949 --> 20:01.825
A Bible?

20:02.993 --> 20:05.621
The surgery's very serious.
Anything could happen.

20:06.246 --> 20:09.208
I'll feel a lot better
holding a Bible right now, you know?

20:09.291 --> 20:10.250
Do you mind?

20:15.589 --> 20:16.506
Cuff her.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.674
Yes, ma'am.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.929
First we get your Bible,
then you change into your hospital gown.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.319
I, uh…

20:38.904 --> 20:40.822
I need the restroom right now.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.076
Can you wait until she comes back?

20:45.202 --> 20:46.328
It's pretty urgent.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.997
She'll be back very soon. Just hold it.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.291
I need to go now.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.386
How do I use the bathroom like this?

21:02.970 --> 21:03.971
You'll make it work.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.765
This is a human rights violation.

21:08.392 --> 21:12.396
I'm not here for myself, right?
I'm donating my kidney to her daughter.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.398
This

21:14.982 --> 21:16.233
is how you treat a donor?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.735
I'm just following the rules. I'm sorry.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.323
-Then I won't go through with it.
-What?

21:24.324 --> 21:27.286
I don't wanna donate my kidney
if I'm going to be treated like this.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.454
I don't think you can change your mind.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.498
Call the warden,
and let her know I won't do it.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.834
Eun-suk should know I refused as well.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.686
23-7 HUISE-RI,
MAEMI-EUP, JINIL-GUN

22:20.589 --> 22:22.341
You're…?

22:22.424 --> 22:25.218
There's… something weird about that…

22:27.220 --> 22:28.722
tteokbokki truck lady.

22:33.060 --> 22:33.935
Get in.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.189
Come on, get in. Get in.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.275
Uh, "Jinil-gun."

22:40.359 --> 22:42.569
Uh… Oh-- Oh my, what does this say?

22:42.652 --> 22:45.947
"23-7, Maemi-eup,
Huise-ri, Jinil-gun," sir.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.703
So that lady knew
that Mi-mo is Mask Girl's daughter,

22:51.787 --> 22:53.663
and she… told the entire school?

22:53.747 --> 22:54.581
Yes!

22:55.082 --> 22:58.001
I wanted to know
how the rumors started, so I asked around.

22:58.752 --> 23:02.339
And everything led back to her,
the tteokbokki granny!

23:02.422 --> 23:06.301
But then I remembered
that she was really fond of Mi-mo.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.887
So why would she spread rumors, you know?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.639
Something just feels off.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.295
HOLY BIBLE

23:52.681 --> 23:55.851
Oh my God! Oh my God, are you okay?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.437
Shit!

23:58.520 --> 23:59.396
Argh!

24:00.981 --> 24:02.566
Goddamn it!

24:04.067 --> 24:06.987
Hey! Hey! Stay right there!

24:07.988 --> 24:08.822
Hey!

24:09.573 --> 24:10.740
-Hey!
-Hey!

24:10.824 --> 24:13.368
-Stay where you are! Let's go, c'mon!
-Let's go!

24:19.624 --> 24:22.002
Oh! Oh God!

24:22.544 --> 24:26.047
-Oh my God! Oh no!
-Horrible!

24:26.131 --> 24:29.134
-Oh, ma'am, are you all right?
-Poor lady-- Oh my--

24:29.217 --> 24:31.178
Are you-- Are you all right? Somebody--

24:31.261 --> 24:34.806
Oh no! You can't just
run in front of me like that!

24:34.890 --> 24:37.809
-We should go get a doctor.
-You really scared me. Jesus!

24:37.893 --> 24:41.021
Wait! She's getting up.
She's standing. I can't--

24:41.104 --> 24:44.649
-Let me help you into the hospital.
-Somebody get her some water.

24:44.733 --> 24:48.111
-Oh my dear…
-Oh! I'll help you in there.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.363
-C'mon, huh?
-Is she actually a patient here?

24:52.073 --> 24:54.284
Hey, where are you going?

24:54.367 --> 24:56.703
You should-- You should go
to the hospital!

24:56.786 --> 24:59.706
Huh? Where's she going? Ma'am!

25:01.291 --> 25:03.919
C'mon. Th-- This way--
No, no, no, no, no--

25:04.503 --> 25:06.838
-Where's she going?
-What is she going?!

25:06.922 --> 25:08.131
That's my car!

25:08.215 --> 25:11.343
Hey, no! Oh my God.
My God! Where are you going?

25:11.426 --> 25:12.511
Are you crazy?!

25:19.684 --> 25:22.103
-What am I gonna do?
-Over here!

25:22.979 --> 25:26.233
Oh no! My car!
She took my car! What am I gonna do?

25:26.316 --> 25:27.859
She took my car!

25:27.943 --> 25:29.903
Argh!

25:29.986 --> 25:31.071
-What?
-What?!

25:31.154 --> 25:33.698
-You goddamn idiot!
-You gotta be fuckin' kidding me!

25:33.782 --> 25:36.535
Are your eyes on your face
just for decoration, you fuckin' idiot?

25:36.618 --> 25:40.038
I'm gonna fuckin' pull your eyes out!

25:46.628 --> 25:47.504
INCORRECT PATTERN

25:51.841 --> 25:53.051
TRY AGAIN IN 28 SECONDS

26:09.776 --> 26:10.694
Hello?

26:10.777 --> 26:11.820
Don't hang up.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.573
It's me, Mom, don't hang up.
Please, listen to me.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.783
Mi-mo is in danger right now.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.411
Mi-mo's in danger? What do you mean?

26:20.120 --> 26:22.539
Oh-nam Ju's mom is trying to hurt Mi-mo.

26:23.331 --> 26:24.624
Oh-nam Ju's mother?

26:24.708 --> 26:29.546
That woman has been stalking Mi-mo
and just ruining her life this whole time.

26:30.463 --> 26:32.882
So that woman is the mother of Oh-nam Ju?

26:34.968 --> 26:38.597
Mom, do you know anything
about her that I don't?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.099
Well, I…

26:41.182 --> 26:43.768
I think Mi-mo's with that woman right now.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.104
And actually, I'm on my way to see her.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.189
You're on your way, right now?

26:48.273 --> 26:49.399
Don't do that!

26:49.482 --> 26:52.110
She's really dangerous.
Don't go face her alone.

26:52.193 --> 26:53.862
Report her to the police first.

26:54.362 --> 26:58.575
If you know her address or phone number,
give it to me right now. Please!

26:59.492 --> 27:01.578
Uh… just a second.

27:02.829 --> 27:08.543
It's "23-7 Maemi-eup,
Huise-ri, Jinil-gun."

27:10.795 --> 27:12.380
Thank you so much, Mom.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.012
JINIL-GUN

27:28.980 --> 27:31.149
You, get out here now.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.028
Wait, but I wanna go with you.
I have something to say to Mi-mo.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.405
-Please? Please!
-I can't let you come along.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.365
Get out of here.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.746
Law Enforcement. What's your emergency?

27:44.829 --> 27:46.998
Is this… Is this the police?

27:53.755 --> 27:54.756
Taxi!

27:59.969 --> 28:02.889
Sir, to 23-7 Maemi-eup,
Huise-ri, Jinil-gun.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.191
HOW TO TURN ON THE CAMCORDER

28:13.274 --> 28:14.109
Damn it.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.778
Who can fucking read this?

28:28.123 --> 28:30.333
Oh no. She's awake.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.045
She's not supposed to be awake yet.

28:42.971 --> 28:46.391
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm doing this.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.853
Sorry, Mi-mo.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.439
This is your mother's fault.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.446
Do you know how my son died?

29:01.239 --> 29:02.198
Your mother…

29:04.242 --> 29:05.535
butchered him.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.789
She cut him up into pieces.

29:12.125 --> 29:15.336
I really didn't want it to come this far.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.505
But you came to me.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.592
So I went to see her,
and I wanted to tell her about it.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.262
But she looked… she looked so peaceful.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.931
She even had the audacity to

29:27.891 --> 29:29.809
tell me that she found salvation.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.354
Stupid lying slut.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.024
How dare she speak

29:36.816 --> 29:38.777
about salvation to me?

29:39.652 --> 29:40.904
My whole life

29:41.780 --> 29:43.323
was a living hell.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.325
Granny!

29:46.534 --> 29:47.994
I'll say it again.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.206
You did nothing wrong.

29:52.457 --> 29:53.416
Don't worry.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.086
If you want to blame someone, blame her.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.505
Your mother.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.217
Okay, it's working.

30:04.719 --> 30:08.723
I'm going to send
your last moments to your mother.

30:55.436 --> 30:58.857
Oh-- Oh my God! Oh my God,
your-- your face. There's blood!

30:58.940 --> 31:00.400
Uh-- Are you all right?

31:00.483 --> 31:04.320
Yes. Could you, um, maybe give me a ride
to Maemi-eup, if that's okay?

31:05.113 --> 31:06.197
"Maemi-eup"?

31:07.323 --> 31:09.701
But Maemi-eup is… the other way.

31:10.702 --> 31:14.122
Uh, I… fought with my husband
and got out of the car.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.624
I don't even know where I am right now.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.711
If you could help me, I'd be so grateful.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.421
Must've been a big fight, huh?

31:22.297 --> 31:26.092
Ouch! Okay. Uh, you can get in. C'mon.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.224
I fought with
my husband the other day too.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.602
I was so angry
I almost jumped out of the moving car.

31:36.311 --> 31:40.023
Ugh! I mean,
I should've gotten a divorce then.

31:40.106 --> 31:42.025
"Think of the kids," I said to myself.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.862
So I didn't divorce him,
but he still keeps ordering me around!

31:45.945 --> 31:49.824
It's not like he makes that much money
to feel like such a big shot. You know?

31:51.910 --> 31:55.038
Do you know what happened
when we had our first child?

31:55.538 --> 31:56.915
He was nowhere to be found!

32:09.594 --> 32:10.428
What?

32:10.929 --> 32:11.846
Something to say?

32:29.530 --> 32:30.406
What is it?

32:30.990 --> 32:31.950
Granny,

32:32.951 --> 32:33.910
I'm so cold.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.089
-Here. Better now?
-Granny!

32:47.590 --> 32:48.758
I'm so sorry!

32:50.385 --> 32:51.344
Please let me live.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.807
Shouldn't have ripped it off.

33:00.436 --> 33:01.854
Now what?

33:07.443 --> 33:08.486
DESTINATION: MAEMI-EUP, JINIL-GUN

33:08.569 --> 33:11.656
Finally, when we found him,
he was in the hospital,

33:11.739 --> 33:13.074
sleeping in another room!

33:13.157 --> 33:14.492
Ah, man!

33:14.575 --> 33:18.496
Um, I'm sorry, uh, do you mind
if I check something on the navigation?

33:18.579 --> 33:19.831
Oh, of course.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.878
And then, when we had
our second child, you know what he did?

33:25.962 --> 33:27.588
I got a C-section, and he just--

33:27.672 --> 33:29.173
Breaking news.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.010
This afternoon, the serial killer
known as Mask Girl

33:32.093 --> 33:35.096
has managed to escape
while receiving hospital treatment.

33:35.179 --> 33:39.475
She's a woman in her forties,
with short hair, around five foot five.

33:40.059 --> 33:43.563
She was injured during her escape
and has a wound on her face.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.607
If you see anyone
who matches this description,

33:46.691 --> 33:49.068
please report it
to the police immediately.

34:01.622 --> 34:02.790
-Hey.
-Yes?

34:03.958 --> 34:07.378
Uh, I'll just get out here.
But thanks a lot for your help.

34:26.898 --> 34:27.899
Is this the police?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.238
Um, can I help you?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.991
We got a call not long ago,
and the caller reported

34:37.075 --> 34:39.077
a middle school girl locked in here, so…

34:39.869 --> 34:41.704
Oh, my dear Lord.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.039
But I live alone.

34:43.122 --> 34:46.375
I'm sorry, but could I just have
a quick look around, if you don't mind?

34:46.459 --> 34:49.337
I'm sure you understand. We got a call,
so we should check, you know?

34:52.715 --> 34:55.468
-Mmm. Sure, but make it quick.
-I will.

35:00.389 --> 35:01.224
Wow!

35:01.808 --> 35:03.309
This…

35:03.392 --> 35:06.479
Why would you have a rock
like this in your house?

35:06.979 --> 35:09.941
Whoa, it's like there's actual power
emanating from it, huh?

35:10.483 --> 35:11.776
Is this a real rock?

35:15.488 --> 35:17.406
Wow, that is so interesting!

35:18.366 --> 35:20.660
-All right. Well, let's take a look.
-Mmm.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.330
Hmm.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.087
What's over here?

35:34.465 --> 35:36.342
Nah, it's the bathroom.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.645
There's something here too.
What is it?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.730
This is the kitchen.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.357
Ohhh.

35:57.822 --> 35:58.656
Huh?

35:59.240 --> 36:00.575
This…

36:01.492 --> 36:02.326
What?

36:02.910 --> 36:06.247
This right here
should be in the fridge. Or it'll go bad.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.541
Oh, just leave it. Come on out.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.084
Hmm.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.679
I guess it was just a prank call.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.223
Yeah, you came here for nothing.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.144
-Well…
-Well, God bless you.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.395
Thank you. Bye.

36:30.855 --> 36:34.275
It was just a prank call.
A damn prank call.

36:39.864 --> 36:41.282
Somebody help me!

36:48.831 --> 36:51.125
Hey. Did you just hear that?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.460
What? Hear what?

36:57.131 --> 36:58.549
I'll go check again.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.137
Emergency.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.350
Prison fugitive seen near Huise Mountain.
Requesting backup to Mount Huise.

37:07.850 --> 37:09.977
Copy that.
Vehicle three'll be right there.

37:52.144 --> 37:53.854
I should hurry up with this.

37:56.607 --> 37:59.860
I'm soft. The problem is I'm too soft.

38:01.153 --> 38:03.322
What goes around comes around.

38:04.699 --> 38:08.411
This is a simple… and fair punishment.

38:09.829 --> 38:10.955
Divine mission.

38:19.588 --> 38:23.342
Uh, could you wait here, sir?
I'm just gonna get the child.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.678
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in a hurry to get back.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.390
-So you really can't wait?
-I'm sorry, ma'am.

38:33.519 --> 38:36.480

The devil tempts me ♪

38:36.564 --> 38:39.191

…he will hold me fast.

39:29.909 --> 39:30.743
Mi-mo!

39:47.176 --> 39:48.427
What the hell?

39:49.929 --> 39:52.640
Why did you
break into my house like a damn thief?

39:55.810 --> 39:58.729
What on earth did she do to deserve this?

39:59.730 --> 40:01.732
What about…

40:01.816 --> 40:04.151
What about my son?!

40:04.819 --> 40:06.445
What did he do wrong?

40:06.529 --> 40:07.530
Mi-mo!

40:08.364 --> 40:10.199
-Granny!
-Who's this kid?

40:10.908 --> 40:14.078
Mi-mo's in there!
Just go get her!

40:15.079 --> 40:18.332
Where do you think you're…

40:18.416 --> 40:21.127
Mi-mo!

40:25.172 --> 40:26.966
Hey, Mi-mo!

40:29.051 --> 40:31.720
Mi-mo, are you okay?

40:39.145 --> 40:41.272
Mi-mo! Are you okay? Huh?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.484
Mi-mo! Are you okay?

40:45.568 --> 40:48.529
-How did you get here?
-I'm sorry, Mi-mo!

40:49.530 --> 40:53.909
I'm really sorry for lying to you! I am.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.704
I only did it because I like you. Oh…

40:58.247 --> 41:01.959
I didn't… I didn't spread the rumors,
I swear I didn't.

41:02.793 --> 41:03.794
I know.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.838
I missed you so much!

41:06.422 --> 41:09.300
I missed you.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.137
-Wait, I'm--
-Oh, I'm sorry.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.812
I can't untie it!
It's too tight!

41:27.485 --> 41:31.363
Uh, what? Are you trying to be
a good grandmother now?

41:41.957 --> 41:44.793
You're going to be punished
by the heavens.

41:47.129 --> 41:50.174
You go and say that
to your daughter!

41:54.470 --> 41:56.180
Die, you fucking bitch!

42:01.769 --> 42:03.145
Mom!

42:06.565 --> 42:07.525
Mom.

42:14.073 --> 42:18.202
Mi-mo… Get Mi-mo first. Go!

42:18.994 --> 42:20.746
Hurry! Go get her.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.214
Uh, who are you? Who are you?!

43:13.048 --> 43:15.009
Let's get out of this place first.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.344
Help me.

43:21.432 --> 43:22.641
Okay, get up.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.238
Oh my!

43:37.948 --> 43:39.366
Look who's here.

43:40.534 --> 43:44.163
You came to me
by your own free will.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.625
Oh my Lord!

43:49.710 --> 43:52.379
You got sick of being alive, huh?

44:04.808 --> 44:05.809
You had to…

44:08.228 --> 44:09.313
go this far?

44:13.817 --> 44:14.777
This

44:16.278 --> 44:18.072
is all because of you.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.586
You bitch!

44:47.351 --> 44:50.437
Get out! Get out of here now! Go!

44:53.899 --> 44:56.318
You bitch,
just die already!

45:05.452 --> 45:06.912
Grandma!

45:12.126 --> 45:12.960
Grandma!

45:15.838 --> 45:17.715
Don't die!

45:20.759 --> 45:22.302
It's okay.

45:22.386 --> 45:23.220
Grandma…

45:24.430 --> 45:25.472
I'm sorry.

45:27.558 --> 45:28.684
I'm so sorry.

45:33.063 --> 45:34.064
Grandma…

45:35.607 --> 45:36.650
Mi-mo.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.112
I'm…

45:44.241 --> 45:45.117
I'm…

45:46.994 --> 45:48.537
Grandma!

45:49.580 --> 45:50.789
…sorry.

45:51.373 --> 45:52.875
Grandma.

45:54.042 --> 45:54.877
Mi-mo.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.505
Grandma.

45:59.339 --> 46:00.382
Grandma!

46:00.466 --> 46:03.510
Grandma! Grandma!

46:08.098 --> 46:11.185
Grandma. Grandma.

46:12.352 --> 46:13.604
Grandma!

46:22.780 --> 46:24.114
It ends right here.

46:24.198 --> 46:25.908
You fucking…

46:38.462 --> 46:39.588
You wanna end this?

46:40.839 --> 46:42.341
It already ended

46:43.217 --> 46:44.384
when my son died.

47:25.759 --> 47:28.387
Oh, for… crying out loud.

49:54.700 --> 49:57.285
Mo-mi Kim.
Put your hands up.

49:58.078 --> 49:59.287
It's over.

50:21.768 --> 50:22.769
Who's that old lady?

50:26.273 --> 50:27.941
Oh my.

50:31.445 --> 50:32.612
The Lord ha--

50:33.405 --> 50:35.574
The Lord has sent me his army.

50:40.537 --> 50:42.497
Hey. That's not a gun, is it?

50:43.457 --> 50:44.833
It's a gun! She has a gun!

50:44.916 --> 50:46.626
Ma'am, put the gun down!

50:47.127 --> 50:49.212
Now! Put the gun down!

50:50.047 --> 50:54.009
Only if you… do it first, you bastard!

50:54.092 --> 50:56.053
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

50:56.678 --> 50:58.180
Put the gun down now!

50:58.263 --> 51:00.682
If you don't, we will be forced to shoot.

51:00.766 --> 51:01.600
Ma'am!

51:02.225 --> 51:03.852
You…

51:03.935 --> 51:05.103
This is your last warning!

51:05.187 --> 51:07.731
-…feel exactly what I felt, bitch.
-Put the gun down!

51:08.356 --> 51:09.441
Ma'am!

51:10.150 --> 51:12.569
-Put your gun down!
-Feel my pain.

51:14.905 --> 51:15.739
No!

51:16.364 --> 51:17.199
No!

52:40.657 --> 52:41.658
Mi-mo!

52:42.284 --> 52:43.535
Mi-mo Kim!

52:50.584 --> 52:53.503
-Where did you get that?
-Oh, I bought a used one.

52:54.045 --> 52:56.756
-Did you sell something to afford it?
-Of course not!

52:56.840 --> 52:58.717
I bought it with my own money, okay?

52:59.593 --> 53:00.427
Shall we?

53:11.313 --> 53:13.815
Since that day,
so much has changed.

53:15.901 --> 53:19.112
Ye-chun's parents
became my temporary guardians.

53:19.821 --> 53:21.323
And I went back to school.

53:24.743 --> 53:26.620
The hate I felt towards other people…

53:27.162 --> 53:28.496
I don't feel that anymore.

53:32.459 --> 53:33.293
Also,

53:34.502 --> 53:36.630
that woman who used to appear
in my dreams…

53:38.924 --> 53:40.258
she never appeared again.

54:15.710 --> 54:17.212
