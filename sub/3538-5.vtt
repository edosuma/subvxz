It would be easier for a man

18:53.720 --> 18:56.303
to steal the sunrise.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.845
Yes.

19:00.929 --> 19:04.679
And if any man even tries
to tamper with you again,

19:04.762 --> 19:06.845
well...

19:06.929 --> 19:09.387
a swift kick in
the you-know-where, I've found,

19:09.470 --> 19:11.470
often ends the conversation.

19:19.845 --> 19:22.428
My brother is a policeman.

19:22.512 --> 19:24.637
When he was in the academy,

19:24.720 --> 19:27.929
he taught me how to put
a suspect in a chokehold

19:28.011 --> 19:30.595
in case any of the boys
got too fresh.

19:34.011 --> 19:36.428
Your brother
is a police officer?

19:36.512 --> 19:38.053
Yep,

19:38.136 --> 19:41.845
the first Chicano detective
of the LAPD.

19:41.929 --> 19:44.303
We're all crazy proud of Tiago.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.387
No, I said stage left!

19:56.011 --> 19:58.428
Soon they went back
to the beach house

19:58.512 --> 20:01.053
and stayed all night.

20:02.345 --> 20:05.095
Foolish girl.

20:05.178 --> 20:06.970
Foolish little girl.

20:07.053 --> 20:08.637
Want me
to keep following her?

20:08.720 --> 20:10.303
No.

20:15.261 --> 20:17.261
We know how this
is going to end,

We need to have a chat

21:04.136 --> 21:06.762
about your friend,
James Reilly.

21:06.845 --> 21:09.887
Officer Reilly's dead,
but you probably know that.

21:09.970 --> 21:12.387
So?
He was a shit.

21:12.470 --> 21:14.512
Agreed.

21:14.595 --> 21:15.845
How did you find me?

21:15.929 --> 21:18.804
We all know
about his Sonoratown honeys.

21:18.887 --> 21:21.261
Didn't take much asking
to get to you.

21:21.345 --> 21:23.804
When's the last time
you saw him alive?

21:23.887 --> 21:25.428
I don't remember.

21:25.512 --> 21:27.679
What do you remember?

21:30.303 --> 21:31.845

Murder is
a serious crime, Sofia.

I ain't telling you shit.

21:36.261 --> 21:39.303
We can take you in right now

21:47.512 --> 21:49.762
I was in bed.

21:49.845 --> 21:53.387
Jimmy was next to me.

21:53.470 --> 21:55.720
He was a terrible lay,
you should know.

21:55.804 --> 21:57.845
Wait, I'm shocked.

22:00.095 --> 22:03.220
The door got kicked open.

22:03.303 --> 22:06.553
Four people.
They cut him with a razor.

22:06.637 --> 22:08.095
Who did?

22:08.178 --> 22:09.512
Someone cut him.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.303
So you saw who killed him?

22:11.387 --> 22:14.095
No, I didn't see.

22:14.178 --> 22:16.345
Fly Rico pushed me
out of the room.

Tell us who else
was in the room.

23:33.637 --> 23:34.970
Yeah, that's the one.

angel face.

24:09.845 --> 24:13.011
Lewis sent me.
He couldn't make it.

24:13.095 --> 24:15.136
How's the numbers coming?

24:15.220 --> 24:17.136
Leave me alone.

24:17.970 --> 24:19.887
Put that down.

24:19.970 --> 24:22.387
So this is the idea, huh?

24:22.470 --> 24:26.553

24:26.637 --> 24:29.428

not practical application.

Isn't that convenient?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.679
Unfortunately,
your Nazi friends

24:33.762 --> 24:36.637
do a lot
of practical application.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.762
Detective Michener
wants to remind you

24:39.845 --> 24:41.679
that he will do
everything he can

24:41.762 --> 24:43.762
to protect you
from those terrible men,

24:43.845 --> 24:46.136
but you gotta do
what you promised--

24:46.220 --> 24:49.303
stay away
from those German bastards.

24:49.387 --> 24:52.595
Do not answer their calls,
do not meet with them,

24:52.679 --> 24:54.387
and if they try to get to you,

24:54.470 --> 24:56.595
you contact me or Lewis
right away.

24:56.679 --> 24:58.345
Got that?

25:00.011 --> 25:02.345
Okay, sure.

25:02.428 --> 25:04.345
Aces.

25:04.428 --> 25:06.887
Now tell me
about your crazy rocket.

25:09.011 --> 25:10.762
It's kind of technical.

25:10.845 --> 25:14.970
Honey, I learned
how to wire explosives

25:15.053 --> 25:17.970
with the anarchists
back in the Haymarket days.

25:20.136 --> 25:21.553
Well, the central problem

25:21.637 --> 25:23.053
has to do
with mass displacement

25:23.136 --> 25:24.637
versus apogee and range

25:24.720 --> 25:26.470
and of course,
the weight of the fuel,

25:26.553 --> 25:27.887
because if the rocket's
too top-heavy,

25:27.970 --> 25:29.929
then it won't be able
to take off.

25:30.011 --> 25:31.637
What I'm working on here is

25:31.720 --> 25:33.553
the rate
of engine fuel delivery,

25:33.637 --> 25:35.637
because if the rate's
too fast...

28:31.553 --> 28:33.679

Hey, Mama,

29:13.762 --> 29:15.762

to Santa Muerte.

29:37.136 --> 29:40.387
Wait, let me guess.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.387
You're not actually
Jewish.

29:53.804 --> 29:57.053

29:57.136 --> 29:59.929
That's one word.

30:00.011 --> 30:02.637
Those teeth...

30:02.720 --> 30:06.011
Her magic
is very powerful.

30:06.095 --> 30:08.095
You pray to her,

30:08.178 --> 30:10.428
and she gives you
what you want.

30:10.512 --> 30:14.595
The gold Santa Muerte--
you pray to her for your raise.

30:14.679 --> 30:17.303

30:29.679 --> 30:33.053

31:18.887 --> 31:21.053

wanted a Chicano.

31:22.804 --> 31:25.970
That took guts.

31:26.053 --> 31:30.178
He probably won't tell you
how grateful he is.

31:30.261 --> 31:32.053
He thanks me every day

33:19.095 --> 33:21.345
Yeah, well, life is short.

33:21.428 --> 33:23.553
Indeed.

33:23.637 --> 33:26.220
- The blue?
- Royal, sir.

33:26.303 --> 33:28.595
'Cause, you know,
life isn't all about work

33:28.679 --> 33:29.929

It's like I've always been

34:04.720 --> 34:06.261

I've never heard you
rhapsodizing about anything,
