06:45.304 --> 06:47.240
AMANDA, I'M NOT GOOD IN MATH.

06:47.306 --> 06:48.841

07:12.031 --> 07:13.666
GO HOME IF YOU'RE SO BORED.

07:13.733 --> 07:14.500

10 SECONDS PAST 2.00.

07:36.355 --> 07:36.823

07:36.889 --> 07:37.690
UNCLE MAX HAD ME WORKING

07:39.392 --> 07:40.526

07:40.593 --> 07:41.427
TAKE AN ITEM FROM ONE PLACE

07:41.494 --> 07:42.728

07:42.795 --> 07:45.531
&gt;&gt; IT'S A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

07:45.598 --> 07:46.699
&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA GO EAT A HAT.

&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE A GIANT INCINERATOR

08:11.958 --> 08:14.026

08:22.735 --> 08:24.604
&gt;&gt; GUYS, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

AND BURN UP MORE STUFF.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.574
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO BURN.

08:28.641 --> 08:29.442
YOU EVEN BURNED THE SIGN

09:15.821 --> 09:21.460
UP 10 DEGREES.

09:21.527 --> 09:22.061
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD THEY MAKE

09:22.128 --> 09:23.729
POISONOUS PANTS SO DELICIOUS?

09:23.796 --> 09:24.797
AND LEAVE THEM IN A LOCKED VAULT

09:24.864 --> 09:25.498
WHERE KIDS CAN JUST

09:25.564 --> 09:29.201
WANDER IN AND EAT 'EM?

09:29.268 --> 09:31.871
&gt;&gt; IT'S CALLED THE REJECT ROOM.

09:31.938 --> 09:32.505
&gt;&gt; IT'S MORE LIKE

09:32.571 --> 09:33.105
A HOUSE OF HORRORS.

09:33.172 --> 09:33.706
THEY SHOULD MAKE

09:33.773 --> 09:35.241
PRISONERS WEAR THIS STUFF.

09:42.148 --> 09:42.782
&gt;&gt; BUT WHY WOULD YOUR DRESS

09:42.848 --> 09:44.150
BE IN THE REJECT ROOM?

09:44.216 --> 09:45.251
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.285
&gt;&gt; DUDE, YOU CAN STOP TALKING.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.120
&gt;&gt; UNLESS, AND I'M JUST

10:00.933 --> 10:02.068
WHO I DO FEEL BAD FOR?

10:02.134 --> 10:03.202

10:03.269 --> 10:04.570
MADE ENTIRELY OF FEATHERS.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S MINE.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.139
&gt;&gt; LET ME FINISH.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.141
CLOWN IS MY HIGHEST HONOR.

10:09.208 --> 10:09.942
WHERE WOULD THE WORLD BE

10:10.009 --> 10:12.678

10:12.745 --> 10:13.279
&gt;&gt; ALL THE CLOTHES

10:13.346 --> 10:14.780
ON THIS RACK ARE MINE.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.182
WHAT ARE THEY DOING UP HERE?

10:16.248 --> 10:18.150
IT'S GOTTA BE A MISTAKE.

10:18.217 --> 10:18.584
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW,

10:18.651 --> 10:19.485
WHAT ELSE IS A MISTAKE?

10:19.552 --> 10:20.386
THIS ZIPPER HAT.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.887
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MINE TOO.

10:21.954 --> 10:34.734

10:55.521 --> 10:56.322
&gt;&gt; I ASKED HIM, BUT I THINK

10:56.389 --> 10:57.323
I WAS USING MY SLEEPY VOICE

11:02.261 --> 11:02.862
MAYBE I COULD FIND OUT

&gt;&gt; AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK

13:01.947 --> 13:02.615
MORE ABOUT THE DRESS

13:02.681 --> 13:03.983
I PRESENTED EARLIER?

13:04.049 --> 13:05.351
&gt;&gt; NO, I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.919
IT'S PERFECT THE WAY IT IS.

13:06.986 --> 13:07.653
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH?

13:07.720 --> 13:08.254
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING

13:08.320 --> 13:09.555
YOU DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT?

13:09.622 --> 13:10.356
NOT ONE LITTLE ADJUSTMENT

13:10.422 --> 13:11.423
YOU'D MAKE?

13:11.490 --> 13:12.892
REMEMBER, WE'RE BEING

13:12.958 --> 13:15.961
A 100% TRUTHFUL HERE.

13:16.028 --> 13:16.629
&gt;&gt; I WOULDN'T CHANGE

13:16.695 --> 13:17.630
A THING, TRUE.

13:17.696 --> 13:20.633
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

13:20.699 --> 13:21.100
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

13:21.167 --> 13:21.667
&gt;&gt; NOW, I THINK

13:21.734 --> 13:22.635
MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS

13:22.701 --> 13:24.703
I'M NOT UTILIZING MY LEGS.

13:24.770 --> 13:33.379
[MAKES BIRD SOUNDS]

13:33.445 --> 13:34.613
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GUYS WEARING?

13:34.680 --> 13:35.514
&gt;&gt; WE RAIDED THE REJECT ROOM

13:35.581 --> 13:36.081
TO GET FANCY

13:36.148 --> 13:37.216
FOR THE ART OPENING.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.584
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS LIKE ART?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.219
&gt;&gt; WE DO NOT, BUT WE FOUND OUT

13:40.286 --> 13:42.087
THERE'S FREE CHEESE.

13:42.154 --> 13:42.688
ARE THERE TWO MORE

13:42.755 --> 13:43.389
BEAUTIFUL WORDS

13:43.455 --> 13:46.058
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

13:46.125 --> 13:46.825
&gt;&gt; YOU WANNA COME?

13:46.892 --> 13:47.760
&gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T WANNA

13:47.826 --> 13:49.128
GO ANYWHERE.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.764
&gt;&gt; FREE CHEESE.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.333
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.034
&gt;&gt; THINGS DIDN'T GO WELL

13:55.100 --> 13:55.868
WITH MR. MADIGAN?

13:55.935 --> 13:58.170
&gt;&gt; HE LIED RIGHT TO MY FACE.

13:58.237 --> 13:58.671
I'M NOT SURE

13:58.737 --> 14:00.239
I CAN WORK FOR A LIAR.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.006
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK MR. MADIGAN

14:01.073 --> 14:02.741
WOULD PURPOSELY LIE.

14:02.808 --> 14:03.309
&gt;&gt; SO YOU THINK

14:03.375 --> 14:04.977
HE DID IT BY ACCIDENT?

14:05.044 --> 14:05.544
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

14:05.611 --> 14:06.478
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING HE DOES

14:06.545 --> 14:08.380
IS BY ACCIDENT.

14:08.447 --> 14:09.281
&gt;&gt; I'LL HANDLE THIS.

14:09.348 --> 14:09.715
THEY CALL ME

14:09.782 --> 14:10.883
THE HUMAN LIE DETECTOR.

14:10.950 --> 14:11.817
&gt;&gt; WHO DOES?

14:11.884 --> 14:12.851
&gt;&gt; THE FBI.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.386
I CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.155
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

14:16.222 --> 14:16.822
&gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO USE

14:16.889 --> 14:18.591
MY GIFT OR NOT?

14:18.657 --> 14:21.894
HERE, I'LL DEMONSTRATE.

14:21.961 --> 14:22.494
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

14:22.561 --> 14:22.995
&gt;&gt; 16.

14:23.062 --> 14:23.462
&gt;&gt; FALSE.

14:23.529 --> 14:23.929
&gt;&gt; YES, I AM.

14:23.996 --> 14:24.330
&gt;&gt; FALSE.

14:24.396 --> 14:24.863
&gt;&gt; RYAN, YOU WENT

14:24.930 --> 14:25.531
TO MY SWEET 16 LAST MONTH.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.433
&gt;&gt; FALSE.

14:27.499 --> 14:28.901
PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

14:28.968 --> 14:31.770
IT'S A GIFT.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.672
&gt;&gt; I'M SO MAD AT MR. MADIGAN.

14:33.739 --> 14:34.173
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU NEED

14:34.240 --> 14:34.740
IS TO GET YOUR MIND

14:34.807 --> 14:35.274
OFF ALL THIS.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.675
COME TO THE ART EXHIBIT WITH US.

14:36.742 --> 14:37.543
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THERE'S A DRESS

14:37.610 --> 14:38.177
MADE OF BOTTLE CAPS

14:38.244 --> 14:39.912
GOT YOU WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

14:39.979 --> 14:40.913
I CAN GO GET IT FOR YOU.

14:40.980 --> 14:41.947
&gt;&gt; NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:42.014 --> 14:42.514
I'M GOING TO WEAR

14:42.581 --> 14:43.816
MY SWIRLY DRESS.

14:43.882 --> 14:44.883
I'LL PROVE TO THE WORLD

14:44.950 --> 14:45.918
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

14:45.985 --> 14:46.418
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

14:46.485 --> 14:47.086
WE'LL LEAVE AS SOON AS

14:47.152 --> 14:47.987
JIMMY GETS HERE.

14:48.053 --> 14:48.887
&gt;&gt; JIMMY'S GOING TOO?

14:48.954 --> 14:51.957
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE.

14:52.024 --> 14:52.992
&gt;&gt; JIMMY, YOU'RE WEARING

14:53.058 --> 14:54.026
MY SUIT.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.327
DOES THAT MEAN YOU LIKE IT?

14:55.394 --> 14:55.995
&gt;&gt; TOTALLY.

14:56.061 --> 14:56.629
PLUS, RYAN SAID

14:56.695 --> 14:57.663
HE'D BE MY BUTLER FOR THE NIGHT

14:57.730 --> 14:58.797
IF I WEAR IT OUT IN PUBLIC.

14:58.864 --> 14:59.365
&gt;&gt; I NEVER THOUGHT

14:59.431 --> 15:00.399
HE'D HAVE THE GUTS.

15:00.466 --> 15:00.933
YOU GOTTA ADMIRE

15:01.000 --> 15:02.101
THE KID'S MOXIE.

15:02.167 --> 15:03.002
&gt;&gt; BUTLER, TAKE ME

15:03.068 --> 15:08.307
TO THE ELEVATOR.

15:08.374 --> 15:30.162
WAIT.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.897
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING ME DOWN?

15:31.964 --> 15:33.132
&gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE.

15:33.198 --> 15:33.732
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ANSWER

15:33.799 --> 15:34.366
TO THE QUESTION,

15:34.433 --> 15:42.875
"WHERE ARE WE?"

15:42.941 --> 15:43.409
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU WEARING

15:43.475 --> 15:44.476
YOUR SWIRLY DRESS?

15:44.543 --> 15:47.846
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW IT, GIRL.

15:47.913 --> 15:48.681
&gt;&gt; OH BOY, HERE COME

15:48.747 --> 15:50.115
THE DIZZIES AGAIN.

15:50.182 --> 15:51.216
&gt;&gt; RYAN, THIS PATTERN

15:51.283 --> 15:53.719
DOES NOT MAKE PEOPLE DIZZY.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.820
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,

15:54.887 --> 15:59.458
DO YOU LIKE MY DRESS?

15:59.525 --> 16:02.861
I'LL JUST KEEP MY COAT ON.

16:02.928 --> 16:03.395
WHAT'S THE DEAL

16:03.462 --> 16:04.630
WITH ALL THIS ART?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.498
&gt;&gt; MAN, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

16:06.565 --> 16:07.366
AMANDA LOOKS LIKE A MONSTER

16:07.433 --> 16:08.434
IN ALL THIS STUFF.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.635
&gt;&gt; THIS IS TERRIBLE.

16:09.702 --> 16:10.669
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.172
I DON'T SEE ANY CHEESE ANYWHERE.

16:13.238 --> 16:15.507
OH, THERE IT IS.

16:15.574 --> 16:16.442
&gt;&gt; AMANDA'S GOING TO FREAK

16:16.508 --> 16:17.710
WHEN SHE SEES THIS.

16:17.776 --> 16:18.610
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

16:18.677 --> 16:19.244
&gt;&gt; WE'LL HAVE TO HATCH

16:19.311 --> 16:19.978
AN ELABORATE PLAN

16:20.045 --> 16:21.347
TO PREVENT HER FROM SHOWING UP.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.114
&gt;&gt; I'M HERE.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.216
&gt;&gt; AMANDA, MR. MADIGAN

16:24.283 --> 16:24.683
NEEDS YOU BACK

16:24.750 --> 16:25.784
AT THE OFFICE RIGHT AWAY.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.052
THERE'S A TERRIBLE EMERGENCY.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.454
&gt;&gt; HEY, HEY, HEY.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.521
&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN,

16:29.588 --> 16:31.090
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

16:31.156 --> 16:31.890
OSCAR CALLED AND TOLD US

16:31.957 --> 16:33.192
THE OFFICE WAS ON FIRE.

16:33.258 --> 16:36.295
&gt;&gt; SORRY, I'M LATE.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.764
&gt;&gt; AND I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.331
&gt;&gt; I'M SO GLAD

16:39.398 --> 16:40.299
YOU COULD ALL BE HERE

16:40.366 --> 16:42.434
TO SHARE IN MY GLORY.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.335
I MEAN, LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL

16:43.402 --> 16:44.136
MY HEAD LOOKS

16:44.203 --> 16:47.306
ON THAT SPIDER'S BODY.

16:47.373 --> 16:51.977
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

16:52.044 --> 16:53.979
&gt;&gt; KITTY CAT, YOU MADE IT.

16:54.046 --> 16:54.847
&gt;&gt; CHAD, WHAT IS THE MEANING

16:54.913 --> 16:55.581
OF THIS?

16:55.647 --> 16:56.115
&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S JUST

16:56.181 --> 16:57.082
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.184
I MADE 83 PIECES OF ART,

16:59.251 --> 17:00.519
ALL DEPICTING YOU

17:00.586 --> 17:02.821
AS A GROTESQUE SHE-BEAST.

17:02.888 --> 17:03.455
&gt;&gt; CHAD, I KNOW THINGS

17:03.522 --> 17:04.823
DIDN'T END WELL BETWEEN US,

17:04.890 --> 17:05.157
BUT--

17:05.224 --> 17:05.758
&gt;&gt; YEAH, YOU REMEMBER

17:05.824 --> 17:06.392
WHEN I SAID,

17:06.458 --> 17:07.126
"NOBODY THROWS UP

17:07.192 --> 17:08.660
ON CHAD BRACKETT"?

17:08.727 --> 17:11.163
THIS IS WHAT I MEANT.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.164
&gt;&gt; BUT CHAD--

17:12.231 --> 17:14.133
&gt;&gt; HOLD THAT THOUGHT, KITTY CAT.

17:14.199 --> 17:14.900
I GOTTA GET SOME CHEESE

17:14.967 --> 17:18.070
BEFORE THAT VALET EATS IT ALL.

17:18.137 --> 17:24.009
AHEM.

17:24.076 --> 17:24.610
&gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO DO

17:24.676 --> 17:25.277
ONE OF THESE ART SHOWS

17:25.344 --> 17:26.678
ABOUT MR. MADIGAN.

17:26.745 --> 17:27.246
I'D CALL IT,

17:27.312 --> 17:28.881
BOSS, THY NAME IS LIAR.

17:28.947 --> 17:29.348
SO WHAT IF YOU

17:29.415 --> 17:29.982
DON'T LIKE MY DRESS,

17:30.048 --> 17:30.549
YOU JERK FACE,

17:30.616 --> 17:32.317
JUST BE HONEST ABOUT IT.

17:32.384 --> 17:32.885
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK

17:32.951 --> 17:33.752
THAT WOULD FIT ON THE SIGN.

17:33.819 --> 17:34.686
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT DONE.

17:34.753 --> 17:35.320
AND ANOTHER THING,

17:35.387 --> 17:36.722
"YOU LYING JERK FACE,

17:36.789 --> 17:37.956
MY SWIRLY DRESS DOES NOT

17:38.023 --> 17:44.229
MAKE PEOPLE DIZZY."

17:44.296 --> 17:44.863
&gt;&gt; RYAN'S CHOKING.

17:44.930 --> 17:45.831
ANYONE KNOW THE HEIMLICH?

17:45.898 --> 17:46.832
&gt;&gt; NO.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.866
&gt;&gt; HE'LL BE FINE.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.501
HOW'S IT GOING?

17:49.568 --> 17:50.736
&gt;&gt; GREAT, UNTIL MR. LIAR

17:50.803 --> 17:52.471
GOT HERE.

17:52.538 --> 17:53.639
&gt;&gt; STILL MAD AT UNCLE MAX?

17:53.705 --> 17:54.606
&gt;&gt; WHY SHOULDN'T I BE?

17:54.673 --> 17:55.741
HE'S SUCH A PHONY.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.409
&gt;&gt; HI, KIDS.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.343
NICE SUIT.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.945
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.547
&gt;&gt; OH REALLY, MR. MADIGAN?

18:01.613 --> 18:04.316
YOU THINK THAT'S A NICE SUIT?

18:04.383 --> 18:04.883
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE.

18:04.950 --> 18:05.818
THAT'S WHY I ORDERED THE WORDS

18:05.884 --> 18:07.653
IN THE SENTENCE LIKE THAT.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.321
&gt;&gt; IF IT'S SO NICE,

18:09.388 --> 18:09.888
WHY'D YOU SEND IT

18:09.955 --> 18:11.423
TO THE REJECT ROOM?

18:11.490 --> 18:12.591
&gt;&gt; THE REJECT ROOM?

18:12.658 --> 18:14.393
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.595
I SAW EVERYTHING.

18:16.662 --> 18:19.298
&gt;&gt; OH.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.333
&gt;&gt; WANT TO GO SAVE RYAN'S LIFE?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.936
&gt;&gt; I GUESS.

18:24.002 --> 18:24.570
&gt;&gt; TRUE, I DON'T KNOW

18:24.636 --> 18:25.404
WHAT TO SAY.

18:25.471 --> 18:26.405
&gt;&gt; CAN'T THINK OF ANY MORE LIES

18:26.472 --> 18:28.040
TO TELL ME?

18:28.106 --> 18:29.141
&gt;&gt; I DESERVE THAT.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.142
&gt;&gt; DO YOU REALLY,

18:30.209 --> 18:36.748
OR ARE YOU JUST LYING AGAIN?

18:36.815 --> 18:43.522
&gt;&gt; PLEASE.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.357
TRUE, BEING A CREATIVE PERSON

18:45.424 --> 18:47.359
IS BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE.

18:47.426 --> 18:48.193
SOMETIMES, WE COME UP

18:48.260 --> 18:48.861
WITH AN IDEA

18:48.927 --> 18:50.262
THAT MAKES EVERY SYNAPSE

18:50.329 --> 18:52.197
IN OUR BRAIN SCREAM, "WOW."

18:52.264 --> 18:53.031
OTHER TIMES, WE COME UP

18:53.098 --> 18:54.566
WITH A FEATHER SUIT.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.200
&gt;&gt; IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE

18:55.267 --> 18:56.235
THE FEATHER SUIT,

18:56.301 --> 18:57.703
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME?

18:57.769 --> 18:58.604
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU GOT ME WRONG.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.372
I LOVED YOUR FEATHER SUIT.

19:00.439 --> 19:00.806
&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT

19:00.873 --> 19:01.807
WE WEREN'T LYING ANYMORE.

19:01.874 --> 19:02.474
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DIDN'T LOVE

19:02.541 --> 19:03.675
THE SUIT ITSELF.

19:03.742 --> 19:04.576
IT'S AWFUL,

19:04.643 --> 19:05.811
A TRAIN-WRECK OF A DESIGN,

19:05.878 --> 19:06.912
POORLY CONCEIVED,

19:06.979 --> 19:08.280
IMPRACTICALLY CONSTRUCTED.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.949
&gt;&gt; THANKS, I FEEL MUCH BETTER.

19:11.016 --> 19:12.684
&gt;&gt; BUT I LOVE THE INSPIRATION

19:12.751 --> 19:15.020
THAT LED YOU TO MAKE IT.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.622
TRUE, YOU CAN'T SUCCEED

19:16.688 --> 19:17.089
IN ANYTHING

19:17.155 --> 19:17.723
UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING

19:17.789 --> 19:19.491
TO EXPERIMENT,

19:19.558 --> 19:20.325
AND YOU CAN'T EXPERIMENT

19:20.392 --> 19:22.728
UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO FAIL

19:22.794 --> 19:23.362
AND THAT'S WHY

19:23.428 --> 19:27.566
I LOVED THAT SUIT.

19:27.633 --> 19:28.901
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.203
&gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS WRONG OF ME

19:31.270 --> 19:32.504
NOT TO TELL THE TRUTH.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.105
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN

19:33.171 --> 19:34.473
AND THAT'S A PROMISE.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.140
&gt;&gt; LIKE WHEN YOU PROMISED

19:35.207 --> 19:36.074
TO BUY KOPELMAN A HOUSE

19:36.141 --> 19:37.676
IF HE COULD EAT 30 PIES?

19:37.743 --> 19:38.644
&gt;&gt; HE ONLY ATE 29.

19:38.710 --> 19:39.511
I COUNTED THE PANS.

19:39.578 --> 19:45.918
I STAND BY MY RULING.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.487
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT CHOKING.

19:48.554 --> 19:53.492
WHOA, I AM NOT CHOKING.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.361
&gt;&gt; HEY KIDS, SOME SHOW, HUH?

19:56.428 --> 19:57.396
I LIKE THE INTERPLAY

19:57.462 --> 19:59.064
OF SHADOW AND LIGHT,

19:59.131 --> 20:00.766
SHADOW AND LIGHT,

20:00.832 --> 20:02.334
SO SOOTHING.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.002
BREATHE IT IN.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.739
&gt;&gt; OH, WHAT WAS THAT?

20:07.806 --> 20:08.106
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

20:08.173 --> 20:08.574
&gt;&gt; IT WAS LIKE

20:08.640 --> 20:09.808
A BILLION VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY

20:09.875 --> 20:11.543
SHOT UP MY SPINE.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.110
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WEARING

20:12.177 --> 20:13.111
THE ELECTRIC OPERA DRESS.

20:13.178 --> 20:13.812
YOU'LL BE FINE AS LONG AS

20:13.879 --> 20:14.913
YOU DON'T FALL ASLEEP.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.549
&gt;&gt; YES, YOU MUST REMAIN AWAKE.

20:17.616 --> 20:18.483
NO MATTER HOW HEAVY

20:18.550 --> 20:19.851
YOUR EYELIDS GET,

20:19.918 --> 20:20.619
YOU MUSTN'T DRIFT

20:20.686 --> 20:22.154
INTO THE SWEET EMBRACE

20:22.220 --> 20:24.323
OF SLUMBER.

20:24.389 --> 20:29.027
&gt;&gt; OH.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.128
&gt;&gt; WATCH IT, KLUTZ.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.129
YOU OWE ME A MILLION DOLLARS

20:31.196 --> 20:34.433
FOR THAT.

20:34.499 --> 20:34.833
GET OFF--

20:34.900 --> 20:35.934
&gt;&gt; HEY, THIS IS NICE.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.336
&gt;&gt; AH, YOU LIKE IT?

20:37.402 --> 20:38.670
IT'S HAND-HAMMERED BRONZE.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.272
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT'D BE A SHAME

20:40.339 --> 20:50.148
IF IT JUST TOPPLED OVER.

20:50.215 --> 20:53.051
&gt;&gt; OH.

20:53.118 --> 20:56.254
AMANDA, WHY?

20:56.321 --> 20:57.456
&gt;&gt; ONCE A SHE-BEAST,

20:57.522 --> 21:00.659
ALWAYS A SHE-BEAST.

21:00.726 --> 21:01.927
&gt;&gt; WOW, THAT GUY MADE

21:01.994 --> 21:04.196
A REAL MESS OF THIS PLACE.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.263
&gt;&gt; I KNOW, LOOK AT ME.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.798
I GOT GUACAMOLE ON MY COAT.

21:06.865 --> 21:07.532
&gt;&gt; OH BOY, HERE COMES

21:07.599 --> 21:13.038
THE DIZZIES.

21:13.105 --> 21:13.538
&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT,

21:13.605 --> 21:18.744
THE BLACK-CAPPED CHICKADEE.

21:18.810 --> 21:29.388
&gt;&gt; SHH.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.288
&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN, YOU'VE GOT

21:30.355 --> 21:31.556
A PERFECTLY GOOD INCINERATOR

21:31.623 --> 21:32.190
DOWN THE HALL.

21:32.257 --> 21:32.758
WHY DO YOU EVEN KEEP

21:32.824 --> 21:33.558
ALL THIS STUFF?

21:33.625 --> 21:34.292
&gt;&gt; AH, SOMETIMES WHEN I GET

21:34.359 --> 21:35.394
A LITTLE FULL OF MYSELF,

21:35.460 --> 21:36.795
I STOP UP HERE AS A REMINDER

21:36.862 --> 21:38.563
THAT WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.431
&gt;&gt; MM-HMM.

21:39.498 --> 21:39.898
&gt;&gt; UNCLE MAX,

21:39.965 --> 21:40.932
WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR?

21:40.999 --> 21:42.567
&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S THE AMANDA WING.

21:42.634 --> 21:47.673
&gt;&gt; SHE HAS HER OWN WING?

21:47.739 --> 21:49.641
&gt;&gt; WHOA, THAT'S THE BIGGEST ROOM

21:49.708 --> 21:51.843
I'VE EVER SEEN.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.745
ECHO, ECHO.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.615
ECHO, ECHO.

21:56.682 --> 21:57.849
&gt;&gt; OH, HI GUYS.

21:57.916 --> 21:58.717
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:58.784 --> 22:00.519
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:00.585 --> 22:01.486
&gt;&gt; JUST ADMIRING MY WORK

22:01.553 --> 22:08.260
BEFORE IT GOES INTO PRODUCTION.

22:08.326 --> 22:08.994
&gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T HAD THE HEART

22:09.061 --> 22:10.696
TO TELL HER THE TRUTH.

22:10.762 --> 22:11.363
SHE THINKS IT'S CALLED
