WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.537
Previously
on The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.571 --> 00:06.440
We're 170. We're definitely
sitting on something.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.443
RICK: The oscillator
is on a flat, hard surface.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.678
Could this be the vault?

00:10.711 --> 00:12.313
I found a ship's log.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.448
"It has been agreed
that a deep pit be dug,

00:14.482 --> 00:16.084
"and treasure securely buried.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.218
"The pit to have
a secret entrance

00:17.251 --> 00:18.452
by a tunnel from the shore."

00:18.486 --> 00:20.454
There is a trail now to follow.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.822
It fits in every aspect.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.823
GARY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:22.856 --> 00:24.192
Holy...

00:24.225 --> 00:25.626
I've seen that shape before.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.428
In the Templar prison in France.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.768
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.802 --> 00:38.272
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.306 --> 00:41.575
for more than 200 years.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.612
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.645 --> 00:47.248
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.281 --> 00:49.783
17th century coins,

00:49.817 --> 00:52.286
even bits of human bone.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.123
To date, six men have died

00:55.156 --> 00:56.724
trying to solve the mystery.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.494
And, according to legend,

01:00.528 --> 01:03.331
one more will have to die

01:03.364 --> 01:06.600
before the treasure
can be found.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.185
It is a moment
of great anticipation

01:24.218 --> 01:26.220
in the Oak Island war room,

01:26.254 --> 01:28.789
as Rick and Alex Lagina,

01:28.822 --> 01:31.692
along with Jack Begley,
Charles Barkhouse

01:31.725 --> 01:34.662
and metal detection expert
Gary Drayton,

01:34.695 --> 01:37.898
meet with archeologist
Laird Niven on the heels

01:37.931 --> 01:41.402
of what might be their greatest
breakthrough to date.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.437
One that may hold the key

01:43.471 --> 01:48.142
to solving
a 222-year-old mystery.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.211
Laird, we've got something
to show you.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.613
And I think you're gonna be--
I think Gary would say--

01:52.646 --> 01:55.249
-you're gonna be blown away.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.686
We need to get your dad
and Craig on the phone.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.554
-All right, I'll get them up.
-Okay.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.457
-Hey, guys.
-Guys.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.359
-Hey, guys.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.695
NARRATOR: Also joining them
via video conference

02:07.728 --> 02:11.332
is Rick's brother Marty and
their partner Craig Tester,

02:11.365 --> 02:13.267
who have called in
from their offices

02:13.301 --> 02:15.936
in Traverse City, Michigan.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.406
So, we've invited Laird back.

02:18.439 --> 02:22.643
I think we all understand why,
because of Gary's unique find.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.745
I don't know what words
to put on it.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.348
Gary, why don't you show him
this item?

02:27.381 --> 02:31.185
Yeah, this, um, interesting find

02:31.219 --> 02:33.887
was found in Smith's Cove...

02:33.921 --> 02:35.389
-Okay.
-Mid-beach.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.924
Right.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.493
We think it's gonna
knock your socks off.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.776
There you go, Laird.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.883
LAIRD:
Well, it's lead.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.918
That's a cross.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.754
Holy...

03:06.787 --> 03:09.690
Holy schmoly, all right.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.625
NARRATOR:
Earlier today,

03:11.659 --> 03:14.862
while exploring the shore
along Smith's Cove,

03:14.895 --> 03:18.699
Rick Lagina and metal detection
expert Gary Drayton discovered

03:18.732 --> 03:20.534
something incredible.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.836
GARY:
That's really old.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.438
How old?

03:24.472 --> 03:25.806
GARY:
I would say that is somewhere

03:25.839 --> 03:29.643
between 1200 and 1600.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.380
I've seen that shape before.

03:32.413 --> 03:36.684
I saw a carving like that
in the Templar prison in Domme.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.820
NARRATOR: Even more astonishing
was the fact

03:39.853 --> 03:43.491
that the cross was an almost
exact match to Templar carvings

03:43.524 --> 03:46.527
that Rick Lagina and two
of his nephews had seen

03:46.560 --> 03:50.264
on the walls of a 14th century
prison in Domme, France,

03:50.298 --> 03:52.466
just one week ago.

03:52.500 --> 03:57.738
If it can be determined,
with a high degree of certainty,

03:57.771 --> 04:01.875
that it's a Templar-associated
figurine,

04:01.909 --> 04:05.012
there's a piece of history
missing-- our history--

04:05.045 --> 04:08.649
and I think that is what really
captivates people

04:08.682 --> 04:10.651
about Oak Island.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.421
"What could this mystery be
all about?"

04:13.454 --> 04:17.358
I haven't seen anything
like that before.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.728
-That's a good thing for an
archaeologist to say. -Yeah.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.630
LAIRD: It's a little
asymmetrical, right?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.798
It's quite crude.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.968
-Pierced by a square nail.
-Yup.

04:28.001 --> 04:31.539
I think this is a really
unique find.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.574
There's certainly nothing
that I can see

04:33.607 --> 04:36.644
that would contradict that.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.911
-RICK: There's a story there.
-Yup. Yeah.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.080
-Seems like it wants to speak.
-Mm-hmm.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.350
And I think you're surprised
to see this, aren't you?

04:42.383 --> 04:43.717
LAIRD:
Oh, yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.654
-Didn't expect that.
-No.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.857
It's certainly quite remarkable,
when Laird gives us his opinion

04:49.890 --> 04:51.725
that he's not seen anything
like this.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.327
Here you have an archeologist

04:53.361 --> 04:55.696
who's intimately involved

04:55.729 --> 04:57.531
with activities throughout

04:57.565 --> 04:59.867
the province of Nova Scotia,
and he's saying that...

04:59.900 --> 05:01.769
not seen anything
like this before.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.572
Is there any way
to estimate how long it was...

05:04.605 --> 05:06.940
-in the environment that you
found it in

05:06.974 --> 05:09.443
I don't think too long
because of the condition.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.445
Lead is a soft metal,

05:11.479 --> 05:14.648
-and you can see plenty
of detail on this. -Yeah.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.350
-Yeah.
-Usually there's a white patina

05:16.384 --> 05:17.818
if it's been exposed to air.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.487
-Yeah. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah.
-GARY: The detail on it.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.922
-There doesn't seem to be
much wear. Yeah. -Yeah.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.891
MARTY:
Well, the conjecture,

05:23.924 --> 05:26.660
Laird, is that... that we've
kicked around anyway, is that

05:26.694 --> 05:29.096
we might have unearthed it
when we did our dig with you...

05:29.129 --> 05:31.832
-Right. Mm-hmm.
-...last year.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.435
And then it got washed
to the shore, you know,

05:34.468 --> 05:37.004
-in that big storm.
-Yeah, no, absolutely.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.039
NARRATOR:
Last year,

05:39.072 --> 05:41.775
while working with Laird
to uncover evidence of possible

05:41.809 --> 05:44.144
box drains at Smith's Cove,

05:44.177 --> 05:47.515
the Oak Island team unearthed
a curious rock formation

05:47.548 --> 05:49.883
known as a French drain.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.686
Laird, I'm going
to put you on the spot now.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.588
Man

05:54.622 --> 05:56.056
It's definitely
what we'd call cultural, yeah.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.725
-Okay.
-Um...

05:57.758 --> 05:59.660
MARTY:
You mean, you're saying with...

05:59.693 --> 06:02.663
based on your expertise, with
certainty, this is placed here?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.498
-I believe so, yeah.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.933
-Wow.
-Yeah.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.969
NARRATOR:
Could the mysterious lead cross

06:09.002 --> 06:10.738
be somehow connected

06:10.771 --> 06:12.840
to the construction
of the French drain,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.875
perhaps being accidentally lost

06:14.908 --> 06:18.746
at some point
during its construction?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.749
Smith's Cove has come
roaring back into the top tier

06:21.782 --> 06:24.952
of, um, places
that need more investigation.

06:24.985 --> 06:28.088
You know, in the funny way
that Oak Island seems to work,

06:28.121 --> 06:31.425
perhaps all that excavating
we tried to do

06:31.459 --> 06:34.161
maybe unearthed that...
what is...

06:34.194 --> 06:37.731
could be highly significant--
that medieval lead cross.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.700
MARTY: I mean, we don't know,
Laird. We don't know

06:39.733 --> 06:41.769
how old or anything,
but, you know,

06:41.802 --> 06:43.571
preliminary research indicates

06:43.604 --> 06:47.174
that Gary, you know...
many hundreds of years.

06:47.207 --> 06:50.978
-Mm-hmm. Yeah. -MARTY: Uh,
is that not correct, gentlemen?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.880
Yes, from preliminary,
very preliminary research,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.015
-and that's really...
-MARTY: Right.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.451
-...where this discussion needs
to go is... -Yeah. -Yeah.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.520
...what steps do we take next?

06:59.553 --> 07:04.057
Where do we go
Religious antiquities experts?

07:04.091 --> 07:07.995
-Can we go out of province
for some expertise? -LAIRD: Oh.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.197
No, absolutely.
Yeah, yeah.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.032
There's no issue with taking it

07:12.065 --> 07:13.901
out of the province,
out of the country.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.637
-Well, yeah, because, I mean,

07:16.670 --> 07:19.206
it could have come from Europe,
for example, so,

07:19.239 --> 07:20.774
approaching European
archaeologists makes sense.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.043
-Hopefully. -Right.
-MARTY: I think

07:23.076 --> 07:24.812
we should find a religious...

07:24.845 --> 07:27.781
ancient religious artifacts
expert.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.617
-Mm-hmm.
-And try and get this thing

07:29.650 --> 07:32.520
-pinned down-- where it
came from, how old is it. -Yes.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.187
Yeah, it could be...
I'd be very interested

07:34.221 --> 07:36.690
-to see the results of this one.
Yeah. -MARTY: Good!

07:36.724 --> 07:38.191
-Let's find out.
-Yup.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.627
RICK:
We need to get to work.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.529
LAIRD:
Yeah.

07:52.272 --> 07:55.008
NARRATOR: Two days after
their incredible discovery

07:55.042 --> 07:57.010
at Smith's Cove...

07:57.044 --> 07:59.947
-Morning, guys. How are we doing
this morning? -Good, good...

07:59.980 --> 08:03.717
NARRATOR: ...Rick and Marty
Lagina arrive at the Money Pit,

08:03.751 --> 08:05.753
eager to resume
their massive excavation

08:05.786 --> 08:09.189
of the H-8 drill site,
a site

08:09.222 --> 08:12.025
which they believe
is on the same spot

08:12.059 --> 08:14.528
where an esive
seven-foot-tall wooden vault

08:14.562 --> 08:16.263
was first discovered

08:16.296 --> 08:20.601
by treasure hunter
William Chappell back in 1897.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.135
So, our game plan right now is,

08:22.169 --> 08:24.004
we're gonna oscillate down
five feet.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.774
-RICK: Pressures are staying
steady? -VANESSA: Yeah.

08:26.807 --> 08:30.778
So this is a fresh new cut, and
you can see we're at about 50.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.246
Oh, now we've creeped up
to about 75.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.583
So yeah, we'll get the can down
about five more feet,

08:35.616 --> 08:38.886
and then
we'll let Michel start grabbing.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.993
NARRATOR: Three days ago,
while excavating H-8

08:46.026 --> 08:49.062
with a 60-inch-wide
drilling caisson,

08:49.096 --> 08:51.932
the process came
to an abrupt halt when the team

08:51.965 --> 08:54.234
came upon what they believed
to be a large,

08:54.267 --> 08:59.306
flat, wooden platform
at a depth of 170 feet.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.943
So, uh, he says his pressures
right now are up to 150,

09:02.976 --> 09:06.046
-and he feels like he's sitting
on something.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.716
We're hopeful
that we're close to answers.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.151
We've spent an awful lot
of effort to bring in

09:11.184 --> 09:14.822
this massive equipment
and dig in this one spot,

09:14.855 --> 09:17.625
following a well that produced
all kinds of tantalizing clues.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.326
So, yeah, we're hopeful.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.929
We're getting to the depth
where there should be answers.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.264
NARRATOR: As the team
from Irving Equipment Limited

09:24.297 --> 09:26.600
now resumes drilling

09:26.634 --> 09:30.170
by using a slightly smaller,
permanent caisson,

09:30.203 --> 09:34.074
Marty Lagina joins Jack Begley
and Charles Barkhouse

09:34.107 --> 09:36.844
as they continue
their careful examination

09:36.877 --> 09:41.815
of the spoils recently
retrieved from the H-8 shaft.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.951
-Oh, a bit of pottery! Look!

09:43.984 --> 09:45.953
-Wow.
-No way.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.389
-Look at that. -Oh, my gosh!
-CHARLES: That's a nice piece.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.124
-That's a really nice piece.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.626
That might be one
of the best pieces

09:52.660 --> 09:54.695
of pottery we found so far.

09:54.728 --> 09:59.299
NARRATOR: Pottery? At an
approximate depth of 150 feet?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.334
Could this piece be connected

10:01.368 --> 10:04.972
to the other intriguing
artifacts found in H-8,

10:05.005 --> 10:07.340
like parchment,

10:07.374 --> 10:10.043
fragments
of leather bookbinding

10:10.077 --> 10:13.881
and pieces of human bone?

10:13.914 --> 10:16.083
Is there a design on it, too?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.851
-Yeah, there is.
-Yeah, it's like a leaf.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.120
-It's all so thin. -It's raised,
too, like you can see.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.288
-JACK: Oh, yeah.
-CHARLES: Yeah. Wow. That's...

10:21.321 --> 10:22.790
MARTY:
It's hard to picture

10:22.823 --> 10:24.257
workers down there

10:24.291 --> 10:25.826
with such a fine piece of China
eating their...

10:25.859 --> 10:28.929
Oh, yeah,
we have found some nice pieces.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.833
I'm hoping that maybe the
original depositors used this,

10:32.866 --> 10:34.968
and when we get
to the lower level of it,

10:35.002 --> 10:37.004
we might find
some ancient stuff.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.272
That's the hope. Clues.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.142
NARRATOR: As the 50-inch-wide
drilling caisson

10:42.175 --> 10:44.211
makes its way down
the H-8 shaft...

10:49.182 --> 10:51.451
...it seems to encounter
no resistance,

10:51.484 --> 10:54.287
as if it is sinking
under its own weight.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.992
So, our shaft's excavating
without us.

10:59.026 --> 11:02.062
-Okay.
-Uh, starting, we're at 162,

11:02.095 --> 11:03.330
and our shaft elevation

11:03.363 --> 11:06.166
without us even digging
is now at 172.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.735
-So...
-Oh, wow.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.236
From a driller's perspective,

11:09.269 --> 11:11.338
we would say
that's about a ten-foot void.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.074
But we dropped,
and we're filling up.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.010
NARRATOR:
A ten

11:17.044 --> 11:20.313
Located at a depth of 170 feet?

11:20.347 --> 11:23.383
Could Rick, Marty
and the Oak Island team

11:23.416 --> 11:25.853
have finally penetrated

11:25.886 --> 11:29.389
the mysterious Chappell Vault?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.164
NARRATOR:
At the Oak Island Money Pit...

11:37.197 --> 11:39.199
The casing falling
was one thing,

11:39.232 --> 11:41.935
but what this is doing now?
Unbelievable.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.204
NARRATOR:
...Craig Tester and Rick Lagina

11:44.237 --> 11:46.740
have just heard
the shocking news

11:46.774 --> 11:50.177
that the H-8 caisson has
encountered a mysterious void

11:50.210 --> 11:53.413
at a depth of some 170 feet,

11:53.446 --> 11:55.883
the same depth
where they were resting

11:55.916 --> 11:58.919
on what they believed
to be a large wooden object

11:58.952 --> 12:01.154
just three days ago.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.791
Okay, so,
the can is below the level

12:03.824 --> 12:05.425
of the solution channel.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.295
Um, or that's where
the teeth are, anyway.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.098
NARRATOR:
It is Terry's assessment

12:11.131 --> 12:15.035
that the team is now into
some kind of cavern or tunnel.

12:15.068 --> 12:19.039
But if so, what has become
of the wooden obstruction?

12:19.072 --> 12:22.142
Has the team from Irving
drilled into it,

12:22.175 --> 12:25.212
or could they
have drilled past it?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.880
You know,
is there a void there now,

12:26.914 --> 12:28.481
and is it pushing something
ahead of it?

12:28.515 --> 12:31.418
There's all these issues,
if you will, with H-8.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.020
And there's no question
about it,

12:33.053 --> 12:35.789
it's an emotional
roller coaster.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.124
Hey, Marty.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.158
How's it going, Rick?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.326
It's confusing right now.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.461
-We're all confused.
Why?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.230
Craig, tell him.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.434
The, uh... so, the can's
down to, like, 185.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.903
-Yeah.
-But the plug inside

12:49.937 --> 12:52.572
has moved down five or six feet.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.441
-That's great news.
-It bodes well.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.043
It's in-- it's certainly
interesting.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.912
-We'll see.
-What it means, I don't know.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.814
I'll tell you what it means.
It means we're in the Money Pit.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.149
We're in the collapse
of the Money Pit,

13:02.182 --> 13:03.350
and we're gonna find
what was ever in there.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.985
That's what it means.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.987
NARRATOR:
The collapse of the Money Pit?

13:07.020 --> 13:10.824
In 1861,
treasure hunters attempted

13:10.858 --> 13:12.425
to reach
the original treasure vault

13:12.459 --> 13:15.462
by digging a shaft
adjacent to it.

13:15.495 --> 13:19.532
However, when they reached
a depth of 118 feet,

13:19.566 --> 13:22.202
the shaft, known as Shaft 6,

13:22.235 --> 13:25.472
began to flood and cave in.

13:25.505 --> 13:29.509
Shortly thereafter, they heard
a loud series of crashes,

13:29.542 --> 13:33.346
leading to speculation
that the Money Pit collapsed,

13:33.380 --> 13:36.116
taking whatever
possible treasure down with it.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.988
Could this mysterious void

13:41.021 --> 13:43.456
really be a part
of the Money Pit's collapse?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.592
MARTY:
Any void

13:45.625 --> 13:47.861
before bedrock
is very exciting to me.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.264
Because my pet theory is
that the Money Pit collapsed,

13:51.298 --> 13:53.100
that all those dimensions

13:53.133 --> 13:55.335
that were given years ago
are all inaccurate now

13:55.368 --> 13:57.370
because everything
sloughed down the hole,

13:57.404 --> 13:59.372
and we're looking
for where it could have landed.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.175
Well, if there is sort of a void
it all fell into,

14:02.209 --> 14:04.277
now we're approaching it.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.613
NARRATOR: While waiting
for the team from Irving

14:06.646 --> 14:08.515
to drill down
into the mysterious chamber

14:08.548 --> 14:10.450
at the Money Pit,

14:10.483 --> 14:13.653
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton and Rick Lagina

14:13.686 --> 14:15.588
return to Smith's Cove

14:15.622 --> 14:18.191
to continue their search
of the same area

14:18.225 --> 14:21.494
where they found a mysterious
lead cross just days ago.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.263
RICK: Where do you want
to start first?

14:23.296 --> 14:26.133
GARY: We'll pick up
where we found the cross.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.501
We'll do the areas
around the rock pools,

14:28.535 --> 14:30.904
and then I think
we should get in the rock pools.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.208
RICK: That cross
can't be a singular item.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.911
No, I really don't think so.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.347
RICK: There's no question
that today at Smith's Cove,

14:40.380 --> 14:42.349
you know, holds high promise...

14:42.382 --> 14:43.483
simply for one fact.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.085
The cross intrigues all of us.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.987
It's an interesting object.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.289
Whenever I hear Gary say
"that's very old,"

14:49.322 --> 14:52.425
then it's very important
to get back in that area.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.394
Yeah, I like
this little corridor,

14:54.427 --> 14:57.197
-so I think we'll go up
and down, up and down. -Okay.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.207
Iron.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.209
No, that's definitely iron.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.978
-I know you know
what you're doing. -Yeah.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.980
And that's why I was
so impressed with the cross,

15:13.013 --> 15:15.348
because you believe
it's that old.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.284
Yup. For sure.

15:17.317 --> 15:21.188
RICK: If anyone could ever
be given the moniker

15:21.221 --> 15:23.423
"treasure hunter,"
it's Gary Drayton.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.395
There we go.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.063
That sounded good.
I found that by accident,

15:30.097 --> 15:31.531
slipping on the rock.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.136
That's a great sounding target.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.371
Pull tab.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.473
No. This is gonna be
something good.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.677
Let me just see
if I can pinpoint it,

15:44.711 --> 15:46.613
which will be a bad sign.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.680
You never know, though.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.083
-Okay.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.951
So, that means it's close.

16:00.027 --> 16:03.030
Ooh!

16:03.063 --> 16:06.166
Oh! That looks like the arm
of something.

16:06.199 --> 16:09.202
-That's interesting shape.
-It's lead.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.504
That's an interesting
piece of lead, though.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.739
-Oh!

16:12.772 --> 16:14.274
Or a handle?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.244
GARY:
It could well be a spoon handle.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.479
It's like an "O" shape.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.348
NARRATOR:
A lead spoon?

16:21.381 --> 16:25.318
Found in the same area
as a mysterious medieval cross?

16:25.352 --> 16:29.289
Could these artifacts
be in some way connected?

16:29.322 --> 16:32.559
They would've cut the shape
of it out of a piece of wood

16:32.592 --> 16:34.794
and poured the lead
into the mold.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.164
That looks like it was made
in the mold.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.533
Oh, man, I thought
that was something else,

16:40.567 --> 16:42.235
-when I first heard it.
-Yeah, I know. You were jumping.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.437
Yeah, I've got crosses
on the mind now.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.373
It's definitely
interesting find.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.275
Mm-hmm.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.444
-Perhaps Laird can look at it.
-Yeah.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.681
We respect Laird's opinion.
It's-it's why he's...

16:54.714 --> 16:58.318
we've welcomed him as part
of the team, if you will,

16:58.351 --> 16:59.786
and-and I think
we should reach out to him

16:59.819 --> 17:01.588
and see if he can't assist us
in some way

17:01.621 --> 17:03.190
and perhaps date it.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.757
GARY:
That was it.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.094
All right, let's see
if there's anything else,

17:07.127 --> 17:09.196
'cause the rest of it
might be around here.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.605
Yeah, I don't think
that's too far under the water.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.609
Straight in the middle, mate.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.847
I like it when you turn
your shovel over

17:27.880 --> 17:30.583
and you can see what it is
just sticking out the top,

17:30.617 --> 17:32.652
especially when it's a piece
of silver or gold.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.357
-RICK: Oh.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.560
There it is. Looks like
the fastenings were here.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.463
Some kind of decorative
brass piece.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.465
Maybe off the side of a boat.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.240
NARRATOR:
While metal detecting

17:53.273 --> 17:55.542
in the area
known as Smith's Cove...

17:55.575 --> 17:56.776
There it is.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.146
...Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

17:59.179 --> 18:02.382
have just made
a potentially significant find.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.518
Looks like some kind
of decorative brass piece.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.420
Maybe off the side of a boat.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.325
NARRATOR:
A brass piece from a boat?

18:12.359 --> 18:15.228
Could this have been part
of an ancient ship,

18:15.262 --> 18:18.365
one of many theorized
to have visited Oak Island?

18:19.866 --> 18:22.502
Yeah, we're getting
some big pieces of metal

18:22.535 --> 18:23.836
-off this beach.
-Right.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.239
And I've been over
this beach before,

18:26.273 --> 18:28.775
obviously previous years.

18:28.808 --> 18:32.145
So it's either
the storms bringing stuff in

18:32.179 --> 18:35.482
or pushing stuff off the banks.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.716
Yeah, you would never
have missed

18:36.749 --> 18:38.185
-two big targets like that.
-No.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.886
Yeah, these are too big to miss.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.355
RICK: The interest
in Smith's Cove is that fact

18:42.389 --> 18:44.557
that these are
significant finds, definitely.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.126
We need to pursue it further.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.935
NARRATOR:
Later that day,

18:55.968 --> 18:58.771
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

18:58.805 --> 19:01.174
rejoin the rest
of the Oak Island team

19:01.208 --> 19:03.510
at the Money Pit drill site.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.348
Our casing is at 196,

19:08.381 --> 19:11.884
and our depth in the hole
is at 184.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.186
Plug is 11.7?

19:13.220 --> 19:15.955
-11.7, yup.
-Sweet.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.358
NARRATOR:
Now that the oscillator

19:18.391 --> 19:21.594
has begun drilling deeper
into the mysterious void,

19:21.628 --> 19:23.763
it is the team's hope

19:23.796 --> 19:25.632
that the spoils
brought to the surface

19:25.665 --> 19:27.834
might contain artifacts

19:27.867 --> 19:30.437
or evidence
of possible treasure.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.409
GARY:
I'm not seeing anything.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.211
JACK:
Yeah.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.612
You guys ready to call it?

19:39.646 --> 19:41.214
-JACK: Yup.
-GARY: Yeah, I think.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.515
Is that leather?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.351
I think I got
a bit of leather here.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.886
Is that leather or bark?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.888
That's probably leather.
That's...

19:48.921 --> 19:50.923
I'd say that, yeah. I think

19:50.957 --> 19:52.525
-there's a good possibility
that's leather.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.626
-Yeah. Good eye.
-Yeah.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.662
NARRATOR:
Leather?

19:55.695 --> 19:58.398
Could this be another piece
of possible bookbinding

19:58.431 --> 20:00.833
similar to the sample
recovered from H-8

20:00.867 --> 20:02.802
just a few weeks ago?

20:04.271 --> 20:05.772
Well, from such a big pile,

20:05.805 --> 20:08.241
I mean, we're down
to, like, nothing now.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.776
I put a lot on this table,
but there's...

20:09.809 --> 20:12.211
-No.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.984
GARY:
Uh, check this out.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.519
-Oh, wow.
-Wow.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.721
Look at that. That's a bone.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.257
No mistaking that.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.992
-Excellent find, Gary.
-GARY: Isn't it weird

20:26.025 --> 20:28.428
how all this good stuff's
coming from...?

20:28.461 --> 20:30.430
JACK:
162, right?

20:30.463 --> 20:32.499
-Yeah. At 162.
-Yeah, this is 162.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.667
NARRATOR:
A piece of bone?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.869
Found in spoils taken
from a depth

20:36.903 --> 20:39.739
of some 160 feet underground?

20:41.341 --> 20:43.810
Oh, what's that
jumping up at us?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.712
NARRATOR:
Nearly the same depth

20:45.745 --> 20:48.815
where the team recovered
human bones earlier this year?

20:48.848 --> 20:51.284
What was the depth
at which this was found?

20:51.318 --> 20:54.387
That was between 160 and 165.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.590
NARRATOR: But if this new bone
is also found to be human,

20:57.624 --> 21:00.560
to whom does it belong?

21:00.593 --> 21:03.396
Could it be related
to one of the two individuals

21:03.430 --> 21:04.731
whose bones were dated

21:04.764 --> 21:07.534
to sometime
in the 17th century?

21:07.567 --> 21:10.903
Or could it be evidence
of a third

21:10.937 --> 21:14.273
and, as yet, unidentified
visitor to the island?

21:15.775 --> 21:17.344
Anything, guys?

21:17.377 --> 21:18.578
-CHARLES: Yeah.
-GARY: Yeah! -JACK: Yeah!

21:18.611 --> 21:20.380
-We got lucky.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.848
GARY:
A bone.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.051
MARTY:
Oh, yes.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.487
-I have no idea.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.956
Looks like a kind of
knuckle bone, would you say?

21:29.989 --> 21:32.759
The end of a... end of a joint.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.561
-A joint. There's a joint,
like... -Yeah.

21:34.594 --> 21:35.862
That'd be, like, an elbow.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.930
RICK:
It sounds macabre, but...

21:37.964 --> 21:40.867
we're thinking a skeleton will
come out of there. Literally.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.770
I mean, is it possible

21:43.803 --> 21:45.705
that we only find
one little piece

21:45.738 --> 21:48.708
and

21:48.741 --> 21:51.043
GARY: Yeah, I mean, it just
caught my eye straight away.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.913
-Yeah, 162.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.748
RICK:
The hope continues to be

21:55.782 --> 21:58.818
that we will find
things of substance,

21:58.851 --> 22:02.855
things that will definitively
tell a story.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.357
MARTY:
That's great.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.792
-Bag it and tag it!
-Yeah.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.026
-You...
-I'm on it.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.628
We're only a skeleton crew,

22:08.661 --> 22:10.430
but we're finding bones.

22:12.465 --> 22:16.769
RICK:
That's fantastic.

22:16.803 --> 22:20.507
NARRATOR: It is the start
of another day on Oak Island,

22:20.540 --> 22:23.075
as brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina

22:23.109 --> 22:26.078
join members of their team
at the H-8 drill site.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.515
-MARTY: Good morning!
-Gentlemen.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.551
MARTY:
How deep are we?

22:31.584 --> 22:33.753
CRAIG:
188, 189. Something like that.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.122
We're only about four feet
from where we found the pottery.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.824
That's where I thought
it all fell to.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.392
Yup.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.793
Come on, baby!

22:40.827 --> 22:42.695
Good day
to find Templar treasure.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.564
NARRATOR:
But despite early evidence

22:44.597 --> 22:47.500
that the original
six-inch-wide H-8 shaft

22:47.534 --> 22:50.136
had located
the Oak Island Money Pit...

22:50.169 --> 22:52.038
-RICK: Glazed pottery.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.941
How are we getting pottery
at 190 feet?

22:54.974 --> 22:57.877
...there is now a growing sense
of frustration

22:57.910 --> 23:01.614
that, except for a piece of
bone and some minor artifacts,

23:01.648 --> 23:04.150
the much larger,
50-inch-wide hole

23:04.183 --> 23:07.420
is not turning up
more conclusive results.

23:07.454 --> 23:11.157
RICK: The hopes and expectations
for H-8 were sky-high.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.925
There's no question about that.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.027
We had found
bookbinding material,

23:15.061 --> 23:17.964
parchment, pottery
at below searcher depth,

23:17.997 --> 23:19.732
uh, bones.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.001
I mean, expectations
were off the charts.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.604
But as the day progresses,
we're not finding

23:24.637 --> 23:25.772
anything of interest.

23:25.805 --> 23:27.206
And so, you know,

23:27.239 --> 23:29.742
it gets to be a bit tedious.

23:29.776 --> 23:32.512
You guys are making
some expensive gravel.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.213
-No.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.716
Three small pieces of iron.
Real...

23:36.749 --> 23:39.452
Those little tiny
welding scraps.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.824
CRAIG: I'm just concerned
we lost the material

23:44.857 --> 23:47.093
in the zone
we're most interested in.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.128
I'm gonna go check on this one.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.798
JACK: I feel confident
we've explored this already.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.566
-Yeah,

23:53.600 --> 23:55.468
-I think we should call it.
-Okay.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.737
MARTY:
I can't explain, in H-8,

23:57.770 --> 23:59.138
how we got

23:59.171 --> 24:01.908
so many significant artifacts

24:01.941 --> 24:05.545
out of a small borehole,
six-inch borehole,

24:05.578 --> 24:08.548
and then we run a great big,
giant six-foot caisson

24:08.581 --> 24:11.718
down there, and we get,
really, marginally more.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.853
I don't know why.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.461
Numbers.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.865
We have a 14-foot plug
right now.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.867
But we're stuck.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.069
-Yeah.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.572
CRAIG: So, we think
it's just sitting on gypsum

24:32.605 --> 24:35.274
and seems to be
some pretty big anhydrite.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.177
Digging-wise, it's going slow.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.014
NARRATOR: It is
the Irving team's assessment

24:42.048 --> 24:44.984
that the casing has once again
encountered bedrock,

24:45.017 --> 24:47.787
indicating that
there is likely nowhere else

24:47.820 --> 24:49.956
for the H-8 shaft to go.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.725
It also means
that their current efforts

24:52.759 --> 24:55.227
to locate the Money Pit
must be abandoned

24:55.261 --> 24:57.830
in favor of yet another plan.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.699
How you feeling though, Craig?

24:59.732 --> 25:01.834
I mean, I-I have to say
I'm disappointed. I mean...

25:01.868 --> 25:03.836
But I thought we'd find stuff

25:03.870 --> 25:05.638
-all the way through here.
-Me, too.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.907
Me, too. We really have...
This hole has-has come up

25:07.940 --> 25:09.942
-with less
than the itty-bitty hole. -Yeah.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.712
How is that possible?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.947
I'm just surprised that
we didn't all of a sudden go

25:14.981 --> 25:18.718
through ten, 15 feet of mud,
at least, you know?

25:18.751 --> 25:21.220
And it's...
None of it's been digging easy.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.222
It's like it doesn't make sense.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.824
On Oak Island?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.659
Something doesn't make sense?

25:26.693 --> 25:28.728
Unless it did... You know,

25:28.761 --> 25:30.597
something was in front
of the can,

25:30.630 --> 25:32.198
and we-we were pushing it
for a while

25:32.231 --> 25:34.333
and it was pushing all the clay
out of the way.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.035
Till it hit something hard,

25:36.068 --> 25:37.604
and that's when the drilling
got tough.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.238
Oh, it's still in there then.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.107
-Just pushed to the side.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.242
So, the hatch we dug through
has been pushed to the side?

25:43.275 --> 25:45.277
Exactly.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.680
NARRATOR: The failure to find
the Chappell Vault

25:47.714 --> 25:50.583
has forced Rick, Marty,
and the Oak Island team

25:50.617 --> 25:52.952
to face a bitter reality:

25:52.985 --> 25:56.122
either the drilling caisson
has brushed past it,

25:56.155 --> 26:00.627
or it was pushed even deeper
down and out of its path.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.696
MARTY: The roller coaster
of digging where H-8,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.031
where we found all this stuff,

26:05.064 --> 26:06.966
it's being pushed ahead somehow.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.235
It's so classic Oak Island.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.237
RICK:
It just mystifies me.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.640
We find these intriguing clues,

26:13.673 --> 26:15.174
which seem to indicate

26:15.207 --> 26:17.844
there's something of substance
down there.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.012
And yet, we come up empty.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.313
Well, I shouldn't say empty.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.082
A few tantalizing clues--

26:23.115 --> 26:25.151
more bone, perhaps,
more bookbinding,

26:25.184 --> 26:28.287
leather, um,
but not what we expected.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.957
I'm severely disappointed,
to be honest.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.860
All right, well,
are we sort of done for the day?

26:33.893 --> 26:36.162
Okay. Sounds good.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.973
NARRATOR: After
the disappointing realization

26:47.006 --> 26:49.341
that the operation
at the H-8 drill site

26:49.375 --> 26:51.043
has reached a dead end,

26:51.077 --> 26:53.646
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina

26:53.680 --> 26:55.948
have called members
of their team together

26:55.982 --> 26:58.918
for an important meeting
in the war room.

26:58.951 --> 27:03.255
Joining them is geophysicist
Mike West of GEMTEC Limited,

27:03.289 --> 27:05.291
who has come
with what he believes

27:05.324 --> 27:08.060
is important information
that could help the team

27:08.094 --> 27:10.697
plan their next move.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.833
So, we are kind of on pins
and needles here.

27:13.866 --> 27:16.002
-Show us what you got.
-Well, we have something.

27:16.035 --> 27:18.004
If it's, if it's good,
that's up-up to you.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.706
Okay, just run her down.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.140
NARRATOR:
Several weeks ago,

27:21.173 --> 27:23.710
Mike ran
a dual induction device down

27:23.743 --> 27:26.245
each of the team's
44 six-inch-wide

27:26.278 --> 27:28.981
exploratory boreholes
drilled as a part

27:29.015 --> 27:31.684
of their Geotech grid system.

27:31.718 --> 27:35.855
Emitting an electromagnetic
field two feet in diameter,

27:35.888 --> 27:38.758
the dual induction probe
scanned the earth

27:38.791 --> 27:43.329
surrounding each borehole for
evidence of conductive objects.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.998
So, this is just a plan view
of the grid

27:46.032 --> 27:48.134
that we set out to investigate.

27:48.167 --> 27:51.037
NARRATOR:
Now, Mike has created a 3-D map

27:51.070 --> 27:54.140
representing each
of the 44 boreholes,

27:54.173 --> 27:58.477
which shows the direction
and deviation of each shaft.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.914
He has also incorporated
the dual induction data

28:01.948 --> 28:04.183
to show the exact depth
and position

28:04.216 --> 28:07.453
of each metal object
they detected.

28:07.486 --> 28:11.057
The colors are gonna represent
the amplitude response.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.159
It's gonna go from dark blue
to-to red.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.194
Red's obviously gonna be
your-your strongest responses.

28:15.227 --> 28:17.129
-Okay. -You know,
that-that would be your metals

28:17.163 --> 28:19.431
or your... you know,
when you pass by casing.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.968
They're diamond shapes because,

28:22.001 --> 28:24.503
as you went down,
wherever your amplitude started

28:24.536 --> 28:26.272
to rise and fall, basically,

28:26.305 --> 28:28.440
the longer
the-the diamond shape,

28:28.474 --> 28:30.409
kind of the longer the response.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.245
I assume the silver things are
the casings, the big casings.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.347
-MIKE W.: Yeah,
they're the big caissons. -Yeah.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.449
So, I know
what you're interested in,

28:37.483 --> 28:41.087
like, you know, when we were
logging these holes, was H-8.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.422
Picking something else up
right here.

28:43.455 --> 28:46.158
NARRATOR: When the team first
ran the dual induction device

28:46.192 --> 28:48.961
down H-8,
they detected the presence

28:48.995 --> 28:53.532
of a large metal object
at a depth of some 155 feet.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.734
Well, it is the Chappell Vault.

28:57.203 --> 29:00.106
NARRATOR:
Now, the team is eager to see

29:00.139 --> 29:03.309
what the 3-D model may reveal
about the anomaly,

29:03.342 --> 29:07.814
which they believe to be
the so-called Chappell Vault.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.982
I was really thinking
I was gonna come in here

29:10.016 --> 29:12.484
and stick a fork in this thing,
but we do have, uh,

29:12.518 --> 29:15.822
a couple fairly significant
responses down here

29:15.855 --> 29:19.291
that certainly stand out.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.493
Once this 3-D model
really came together

29:21.527 --> 29:23.963
and all these anomalies
started to line up.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.998
-'Cause that's a cluster
of responses? -Yeah.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.900
What's the depth right there?

29:27.934 --> 29:32.304
MIKE W.:
You're in the 150 to 160 range.

29:32.338 --> 29:35.574
If you say H-8 happens to be
the center of the Money Pit,

29:35.607 --> 29:37.509
which I think it is,

29:37.543 --> 29:42.815
and then you drew a seven-foot
radius circle around it,

29:42.849 --> 29:45.484
which is what the Money Pit
would have been,

29:45.517 --> 29:49.055
you will, effectively,
get all those anomalies.

29:49.088 --> 29:50.990
-Yeah.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.598
If you say H-8 happens to be
the center of the Money Pit,

29:59.631 --> 30:03.102
you will, effectively,
get all those anomalies.

30:03.135 --> 30:06.205
-Yeah.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.540
NARRATOR: During a meeting
in the Oak Island war room,

30:08.574 --> 30:11.978
geophysicist Mike West
is sharing

30:12.011 --> 30:15.314
some incredible information
as to why the team failed

30:15.347 --> 30:17.583
to turn up solid evidence
of the Chappell Vault

30:17.616 --> 30:20.987
during their excavation
of Borehole H-8.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.255
The data supports that there's
some very interesting things

30:23.289 --> 30:26.358
going on in a very defined area.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.628
I think we keep finding out
that this is the Money Pit.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.099
Right where it should be,
really.

30:33.132 --> 30:36.568
The results of
the dual induction log testing

30:36.602 --> 30:39.171
in-in, uh, H-8 indicate

30:39.205 --> 30:43.409
that there is a significant
anomaly about 150 feet.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.511
Well, that's exactly,

30:45.544 --> 30:48.080
exactly where the Chappell Vault
should be.

30:48.114 --> 30:51.217
So it's highly significant.
It's exciting.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.319
You know, what's interesting is,
we get to depth,

30:53.352 --> 30:55.187
look how, look how little
we really did.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.655
-Yeah. -Because, you know,
we're falling out,

30:56.688 --> 30:58.624
hitting bedrock, stopping.
But look at that.

30:58.657 --> 31:02.494
By the time we get to 200 feet,
we got four holes.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.464
Which shows where the gaps are,
for one thing.

31:05.497 --> 31:07.934
Like it says right there,
there's big gaps

31:07.967 --> 31:09.335
right in there
where there's nothing.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.537
-MARTY: Right here
and right here. -Yeah.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.505
NARRATOR: Although the team
completed a total

31:13.539 --> 31:16.475
of 44 carefully plotted
boreholes,

31:16.508 --> 31:19.611
several of them deviated
in the course of drilling,

31:19.645 --> 31:23.249
meaning some areas remain
unexplored in the Money Pit,

31:23.282 --> 31:27.419
particularly around a depth
of 200 feet.

31:27.453 --> 31:30.522
RICK: We have come to learn,
because of the...

31:30.556 --> 31:32.624
gyro data
and the dual induction system,

31:32.658 --> 31:35.194
that there are
undiscovered areas,

31:35.227 --> 31:37.229
or areas that
were not penetrated

31:37.263 --> 31:39.165
by the pattern drilling program.

31:39.198 --> 31:43.069
I mean, we have to investigate
these areas that are

31:43.102 --> 31:45.504
of significant size-- something
could be hiding there.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.606
JACK: The big positive
we should have out of this

31:47.639 --> 31:50.309
is that there is a target
in the Money Pit

31:50.342 --> 31:53.145
where it's supposed to be.
Right?

31:53.179 --> 31:54.213
-Yes, I think so.
-Otherwise-- yeah.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.048
Despite all of the open area

31:56.082 --> 31:57.249
that we missed,

31:57.283 --> 31:58.985
we still got a hit

31:59.018 --> 32:01.053
where we
were looking for it at.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.255
Yeah, the bad news is
it's not in a five-foot circle.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.224
-CRAIG: No.
-Yeah.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.226
MARTY: It's good news.
I mean, there's all

32:07.259 --> 32:09.228
these theories about where
the Money Pit itself is.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.729
You know,
the original excavation.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.364
I think we found it.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.300
I'm convinced we found it.

32:14.333 --> 32:17.036
So yeah, it's a very...
that's a huge bit of news,

32:17.069 --> 32:19.505
and it's probably...
I mean, to me, I think it means

32:19.538 --> 32:21.407
we're nearing the end
of the hunt.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.310
This is good, this is exactly
what we wanted you to do.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.012
Thank you very much.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.614
Here's what I read
from your body language

32:28.647 --> 32:30.649
and your presentation
and everything

32:30.682 --> 32:32.418
that's gone on here today,
said and unsaid.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.153
There's no way
you'd quit on this.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.722
-No. No, I still want
to know, too. -Yeah.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.491
Okay. Well, we're gonna put
all the data we can to it,

32:39.525 --> 32:42.761
and then, you know, the fates'll
do what the fates want to do.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.497
So, let's call this one...
wrapped.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.036
*

32:52.638 --> 32:57.209
NARRATOR: One day after
receiving important information

32:57.243 --> 33:00.612
indicating that the
50-inch-wide drilling caisson

33:00.646 --> 33:03.315
may have literally pushed
evidence of the Chappell Vault

33:03.349 --> 33:05.517
farther down
and then out of its way...

33:05.551 --> 33:07.286
-MARTY: Hey, guys.
-CRAIG: Hey.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.188
-Grab seats.
-...Rick, Marty,

33:09.221 --> 33:11.457
Craig and members
of their Oak Island team

33:11.490 --> 33:14.393
meet once again
in the war room to discuss

33:14.426 --> 33:16.362
their next course of action.

33:16.395 --> 33:19.231
They have also invited
geologist Terry Matheson

33:19.265 --> 33:21.533
and area historian Doug Crowell

33:21.567 --> 33:24.536
to offer their guidance
and expertise.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.372
Okay, guys,
this is a crucial meeting,

33:26.405 --> 33:28.107
and it's got to happen quick,

33:28.140 --> 33:30.042
and we have to make
some decisions.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.444
As everyone's aware,

33:32.478 --> 33:34.480
we're finishing up, uh, H-8.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.249
We have a little bit
of money left,

33:37.283 --> 33:40.786
but the contractor wants
a decision, needs a decision.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.788
It's either up or down,
spend the money,

33:42.821 --> 33:46.525
dig one more hole,
or give over for this year.

33:46.558 --> 33:49.495
We have to make
the decision tonight.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.363
*

33:51.397 --> 33:54.500
Terry, what's your input?

33:54.533 --> 33:57.736
Stop and review.
Stop and review.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.505
Spoken like a true scientist.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.840
Do you think there's
something here to find?

34:01.873 --> 34:04.210
I think there's possibly
something buried there.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.044
A buried treasure, yes.

34:07.679 --> 34:09.548
MARTY:
What I'm still saying,

34:09.581 --> 34:13.452
you know, against all hope,
against all odds, I mean,

34:13.485 --> 34:15.387
that that Chappell Vault
is actually there.

34:15.421 --> 34:17.456
-You think it's there,
don't you? -Of course.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.258
-Yeah, it's there.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.294
-I think... I think it is.
-Well, we didn't find it,

34:22.328 --> 34:24.730
and there's not...
it's not hiding this way.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.799
We have too much data that way.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.202
So, where do you
approximate it to be, then?

34:30.236 --> 34:34.473
Well, if we had to move the "X"
away from the caisson,

34:34.506 --> 34:35.841
what direction should we...?

34:35.874 --> 34:38.210
So, H-8's sitting
right about here, right?

34:38.244 --> 34:41.580
It's the penciled-in circle.

34:41.613 --> 34:44.150
-That's the big caisson
right now. -DOUG: To me...

34:44.183 --> 34:47.119
you got to look up to 20 feet
in this direction.

34:47.153 --> 34:48.720
MARTY:
Somewhere right in here.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.622
Am I reading this right, Craig?

34:50.656 --> 34:52.558
There is quite a lot
of missing data

34:52.591 --> 34:54.526
-Yeah.
I mean, we put a well here,

34:54.560 --> 34:57.263
we put a well here,
we put a well here.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.697
It's unexplored area
at the depth

34:58.730 --> 35:01.767
-that the chamber's
thought to be. -Mm-hmm.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.835
NARRATOR: It is Doug's
assessment that the chamber

35:03.869 --> 35:06.538
they are looking for--
and along with it, the vault--

35:06.572 --> 35:09.308
could lie in a nearly
ten-by-20-foot area

35:09.341 --> 35:12.578
to the south of the Chappell
and H-8 shafts,

35:12.611 --> 35:14.546
where the team
has not yet drilled.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.548
MARTY:
You know, when you amalgamated

35:16.582 --> 35:18.850
all the data
and put fresh eyes on it,

35:18.884 --> 35:21.853
there's room for
that Chappell Vault, possibly.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.256
It's an unsearched area.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.658
We had, as part
of our pattern drilling program,

35:26.692 --> 35:30.296
had a pretty good understanding
of the underground geology

35:30.329 --> 35:33.199
and the underground,
uh, searcher work.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.667
I mean, it's worth pursuing.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.804
I make a motion we dig one more
well yet this year right here.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.839
Do I have a second?

35:40.872 --> 35:43.375
GARY:
I'm biased.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.677
The more drilling you do,
the more stuff you bring up,

35:45.711 --> 35:48.347
-the more chance I've got
to find something.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.682
-Dig. You're in the dig camp.
-Yeah. Yeah.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.751
Hmm. Charles, speak.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.287
I'm abstaining.
It's your decision.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.488
You three.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.890
Not us.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.792
MARTY: Craig,
what do you say at this point?

36:00.826 --> 36:03.329
Um, you know, well,
it's up to you guy--

36:03.362 --> 36:05.564
it's up to you, Rick, more,

36:05.597 --> 36:07.533
'cause-- and the other guys
around this table--

36:07.566 --> 36:09.935
because I'm...
when I'm headed out of here,

36:09.968 --> 36:11.370
I'm probably...

36:14.573 --> 36:16.842
:
...not coming back this year.

36:27.753 --> 36:29.921
...when I'm headed out of here,
I'm probably...

36:31.957 --> 36:34.260
:
...not coming back this year.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.429
*

36:45.771 --> 36:47.606
NARRATOR:
While meeting in the war room,

36:47.639 --> 36:50.942
Rick, Marty
and the Oak Island team

36:50.976 --> 36:54.480
have just heard the shocking
news that their partner,

36:54.513 --> 36:57.015
Craig Tester,
will be leaving the island.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.252
CRAIG:
It's up to you, Rick, more,

37:00.286 --> 37:02.654
'cause-- and the other guys
around this table--

37:02.688 --> 37:04.523
because, um...

37:04.556 --> 37:06.792
you know, I don't want to say,
"Hey, drill here,"

37:06.825 --> 37:09.628
and then not be here
to support you guys.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.665
*

37:13.699 --> 37:16.602
Earlier this year,
Craig and his family

37:16.635 --> 37:20.606
suffered the loss of Craig's
16-year-old son, Drake,

37:20.639 --> 37:24.876
who died of complications
following an epileptic seizure.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.479
CRAIG:
Oak Island, for me, has helped.

37:27.513 --> 37:31.383
Um, it takes my focus
off losing Drake.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.920
Um...

37:34.953 --> 37:36.688
I think of him every day.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.390
I think I'm always out here.

37:39.958 --> 37:43.562
I wish he could be here
helping us.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.365
So, um, it's been a tough year.

37:46.398 --> 37:49.067
Um, time for me to head on home

37:49.100 --> 37:52.938
and... uh, help my wife, who's
struggling through this, too.

37:52.971 --> 37:56.074
Ad, um, so, I'm appreciative
for all the guys,

37:56.107 --> 37:58.677
and I'm appreciate for...
for Oak Island,

37:58.710 --> 38:01.647
for everything it's done for me.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.583
You'll always be here
whether you're here or not.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.318
MARTY:
Yeah, that's okay, Craig.

38:06.352 --> 38:09.588
-Yeah. Yeah. -Everybody
understands that. -For sure.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.390
You won't be able
to kick Jack out of here

38:11.423 --> 38:13.425
-with a ten-foot pole,
so he'll be here. -Yeah.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.827
Yeah. Yeah.

38:15.861 --> 38:19.398
MARTY: It's got to be
bittersweet for Craig out here.

38:19.431 --> 38:21.367
I don't know what's
going on inside him.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.734
I can only guess.

38:22.768 --> 38:25.404
I mean, this is painful stuff.

38:25.437 --> 38:29.708
So Craig's suffering a lot
and he's grieving.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.843
Look, whatever he wants.

38:31.877 --> 38:34.513
Whatever Craig wants, whatever
Craig feels is best for him,

38:34.546 --> 38:36.982
and I... I'm not
going to do anything

38:37.015 --> 38:39.418
but say, "I'll support
whatever decision you make."

38:40.919 --> 38:42.854
I kind of want
to finish this now.

38:42.888 --> 38:46.558
Especially 'cause you said
you're not coming back.

38:46.592 --> 38:48.827
And this is a chance
to finish it.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.496
You know...

38:50.529 --> 38:52.598
I don't know
how to say it exactly,

38:52.631 --> 38:55.000
-but...

38:55.033 --> 38:56.668
I kind of want to try
and finish this for Drake.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.637
There, I said it.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.440
I don't know,

39:01.473 --> 39:02.941
I'm-I'm...

39:02.974 --> 39:06.011
*

39:10.482 --> 39:12.618
Well...

39:12.651 --> 39:14.520
I said it from the start:
one in, all in,

39:14.553 --> 39:15.821
once in, forever in.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.489
I've given it
everything I've got

39:17.523 --> 39:18.957
for-for the last ten years.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.593
You know me, I'm not a quitter.

39:21.627 --> 39:23.595
I was just about to say,
so now you're gonna quit?

39:24.663 --> 39:26.532
No. So...

39:26.565 --> 39:27.866
let's find it.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.568
For everyone.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.503
RICK:
What's the point of being here

39:31.537 --> 39:33.171
if we're not going to try

39:33.204 --> 39:36.942
everything
within our means to...

39:36.975 --> 39:38.710
get an answer?

39:38.744 --> 39:40.846
We're here, in the now,
you know?

39:40.879 --> 39:44.015
Why would we... why would we
not aggressively do this

39:44.049 --> 39:45.684
as best we can?

39:45.717 --> 39:47.018
And so, what does that mean?

39:47.052 --> 39:50.889
It means...
put another caisson down.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.559
There's no...
no question in my mind

39:53.592 --> 39:55.827
we need to continue.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.696
We dig another well

39:57.729 --> 39:59.898
approximately here
to be fine-tuned

39:59.931 --> 40:03.101
between Rick and Doug
and Charles.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.570
What? What were you
gonna say, Jack?

40:04.603 --> 40:06.505
Can we name it
after my brother, too?

40:06.538 --> 40:09.074
Of course you can.

40:10.208 --> 40:12.511
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

40:12.544 --> 40:16.081
JACK: We asked to name the hole
after Drake, and so...

40:16.114 --> 40:19.885
we decided to just use
his initials, uh, DMT.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.220
And...

40:22.253 --> 40:24.122
it-it meant a lot

40:24.155 --> 40:25.924
to me.

40:25.957 --> 40:28.860
Maybe this is the hole
that finds it all.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.563
But it's good to know that...

40:31.597 --> 40:34.500
my brother's a part
of this island forever now.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.468
Okay, good.
Let's dig one more hole

40:36.502 --> 40:38.837
while we're in on this, okay?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.472
Enough of this.

40:40.506 --> 40:41.907
In, in.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.876
-TERRY: Charles, Charles.
-CRAIG: The brothers.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.978
-Let's do it!
-All right!

40:47.012 --> 40:48.714
Good.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.816
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty and the team,

40:50.849 --> 40:53.885
it has been a week
of both incredible discovery

40:53.919 --> 40:56.588
and heartbreaking
disappointment.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.957
But as one door closes

40:58.990 --> 41:01.259
on what began
as a promising investigation

41:01.292 --> 41:03.495
at the H-8 shaft,

41:03.529 --> 41:05.831
another... may have opened

41:05.864 --> 41:09.267
in the form
of a mysterious medieval cross.

41:09.300 --> 41:13.672
A cross that could be not only
the first tangible evidence

41:13.705 --> 41:16.542
that the Oak Island
treasure exists,

41:16.575 --> 41:19.511
but that finding it
could mean riches

41:19.545 --> 41:22.180
that are measured
in something more substantial

41:22.213 --> 41:24.850
than mere dollars and cents,

41:24.883 --> 41:27.986
a treasure that could be worth
all the years

41:28.019 --> 41:32.223
of blood and sweat
that went into finding it.

41:35.226 --> 41:38.930
Next time, on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:38.964 --> 41:41.299
-This is "X" marks the spot.
-Yup.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.934
Let's get that can down hole
and find this thing.

41:42.968 --> 41:44.235
We're good to go, guys!

41:54.980 --> 41:57.749
TOM: It was one of the things
Fred found on the island.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.151
Is this the key
to unlock the mystery?

42:00.185 --> 42:01.853
Is this the key
to Nolan's Cross?

42:01.887 --> 42:05.090
