A REPEAT

02:48.734 --> 02:51.200
OF THE DREAM VALLEY
LODGE INCIDENT.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.033
I SWEAR I THOUGHT
IT WAS A BLACK CAT

02:54.033 --> 02:57.300
WITH A WHITE STRIPE.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.367
HERE'S A THOUGHT.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.100
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE KEEP THIS JOB

03:00.100 --> 03:01.667
AND GET YOU
A BABYSITTER?

03:01.667 --> 03:02.567
BABYSITTER?

03:02.567 --> 03:05.700
W-WAIT, YOU JUST SAID
WE WERE LITTLE MEN.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.400
OK. A LITTLE MEN SITTER.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.467
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
MADDIE WHO WORKS
IN THE GIFT SHOP.

03:11.467 --> 03:13.367
SHE NEEDS THE MONEY.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.700
OOH. MADDIE.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.033

SHE'S GOT WHAT
GOING WHERE?

03:22.367 --> 03:26.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.400
YEAH, YOU BETTER NOT.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.033
HE DOESN'T.

03:29.033 --> 03:31.200
YES, I DO.
NO, YOU DON'T.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.133
YES, I DO.

03:32.133 --> 03:33.734
MR. MOSEBY.
GOOD MORNING.

03:33.734 --> 03:34.900

03:34.900 --> 03:38.033
Both: GOOD MORNING,

03:38.033 --> 03:40.500
WHAT BRINGS YOU UP

03:40.500 --> 03:42.000
COULDN'T SLEEP.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.200
NIGHTMARES.

03:44.200 --> 03:48.400
ACTUALLY, I AM
HERE TO DISCUSS
YOUR BILL.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.033
WHAT BILL?

03:49.033 --> 03:50.800
ROOM AND BOARD
ARE PART OF MY DEAL.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.200

YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

04:07.567 --> 04:11.000
I AM POWERLESS
TO BE OTHERWISE.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.767
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

04:12.767 --> 04:13.600
Man: ROOM SERVICE!

04:13.600 --> 04:15.200
SOMEBODY ORDERED

04:29.900 --> 04:31.133
THIS WAS MEANT
FOR THE OTHER MOMMY

04:31.133 --> 04:35.000
WITH TWINS

04:35.000 --> 04:35.500

SOMETIMES
CAN BE A BURDEN.

04:42.000 --> 04:42.834
YOU HAVE KIDS?

04:42.834 --> 04:46.900

IT'S RENTED.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.734
WHAT HAPPENED?
MUST I BE EVERYWHERE?

20:07.734 --> 20:10.200
JERK PHOTOGRAPHER
CRASHED THE WEDDING.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.000
DON'T MOVE.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I HATE THOSE PEOPLE.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.567
HOW COULD HE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

20:14.567 --> 20:17.200
MAYBE HE REALLY
NEEDED THE MONEY.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.300
BECAUSE
HE LOVES HIS MOM.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.567
I DON'T CARE
WHAT HIS REASON IS.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.700
IT'S AN INVASION
OF PRIVACY.

20:24.700 --> 20:28.400
THOSE PEOPLE ARE
JUST LOW-LIFE,
GREEDY SCUM.

20:31.967 --> 20:34.200
THIS IS FOR YOU.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.400
WE DIDN'T
SNEAK IN THE VENT
TO HEAR YOU SING.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.233
WE SNUCK INTO THE
AIR CONDITIONING VENT

20:40.233 --> 20:42.900
TO TAKE
THE $20,000 PICTURE.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.367
WHAT?
WHAT?

20:44.367 --> 20:46.967
I AM SO FIRED.

20:46.967 --> 20:49.367
WE WANTED TO PAY YOU
BACK THE MONEY.

20:49.367 --> 20:52.567
WE WANTED TO STOP
BEING BURDENS.

20:57.967 --> 21:00.233
COME HERE.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.000
I WAS TRYING
TO STOP THEM.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.667
BETTER MEN THAN YOU
HAVE TRIED.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.000
NOW, LISTEN.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.367
YOU'RE NOT
BURDENS, OK?

21:09.367 --> 21:11.367
IT'S MY JOB TO
MAKE THE MONEY,
NOT YOURS.

21:11.367 --> 21:14.000
YOUR JOB IS
TO BE THE KIDS
AND HAVE FUN.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.367
AND PARENTS
TAKE CARE
OF CHILDREN.

21:15.367 --> 21:17.834
CHILDREN DON'T
TAKE CARE
OF PARENTS,

21:17.834 --> 21:20.200
EVEN IF THEY
ARE BECOMING
LITTLE MEN.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.133
UNDERSTAND?

21:21.133 --> 21:22.667
YEP. SORRY.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.300
MAYBE I DID COME
ON KINDA STRONG

21:24.300 --> 21:25.500
ABOUT THE WHOLE
BEING BROKE
THING.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.200
I REALLY SHOULDN'T
HAVE WORRIED
YOU LIKE THAT.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.700
I WAS...WRONG.

21:31.700 --> 21:32.600
SO, WHAT YOU'RE
REALLY SAYING IS

21:32.600 --> 21:36.734
THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT AND WE'RE
NOT REALLY PUNISHED?

21:36.734 --> 21:39.400
NICE TRY.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.800
YEAH, YOU'RE
GROUNDED FOR
ANOTHER WEEK.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.233
WHEN YOU SAY GROUNDED--

21:43.233 --> 21:45.400
ON THE 23rd FLOOR.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.100
RACE YA UPSTAIRS.
GO!

21:48.100 --> 21:48.734
HEY!

21:48.734 --> 21:50.233
DON'T RUN!
DON'T RUN!

21:50.233 --> 21:52.200
LOOK OUT!

21:53.934 --> 21:55.934
NO!
