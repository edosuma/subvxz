♪♪

00:05.920 --> 00:07.750
- Previously...
- We are gonna be disappearing for a while.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.330
The Organization is sending us to
a safe house in Rio de Janeiro.

00:09.330 --> 00:11.500
- ( all arguing )
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:11.500 --> 00:13.540
The whole point of us
hiding from Zane

00:13.540 --> 00:16.460
is to stay safe, so can we
please not kill each other?

00:16.460 --> 00:18.290
You have the green light
to engage.

00:18.290 --> 00:22.670
Operation Good-bye Coopers
is a go.

00:22.670 --> 00:26.000
Okay, this is like
the unsafest safe house ever.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.120
- Who sent you?
- That would be Zane.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.210
And that would be pain.

00:34.670 --> 00:35.670
Zoe?!

00:38.000 --> 00:41.620
I'm with the Organization. If you
wanna live, follow me, people.

00:41.620 --> 00:43.670
Where the heck
are we going?

00:43.670 --> 00:46.420
To the extraction point where you'll
be taken to a new safe house.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.330
Don't move.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.380
If that Brazilian
jumping spider bites you,

00:50.380 --> 00:52.500
you'll be temporarily
paralyzed from the neck down.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.830
I found some DNA
on this fabric.

00:54.830 --> 00:57.080
If we can match who it belongs
to, we can find KC and Ernie.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.290
Has everybody forgotten
that we are on the run,

00:59.290 --> 01:00.790
looking for
an extraction point?

01:00.790 --> 01:02.920
Everything's fine,
and we're in no danger.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.750
( Sheena yelling )

01:05.750 --> 01:07.620
It's four of us,
and only one of you.

01:10.420 --> 01:13.420
All right, well, now
it's just you and me.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.250
Oh... kay.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.830
What are you gonna do
now, KC?

01:49.250 --> 01:51.000
No weapons
and no back-up.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.210
Almost takes the fun
out of beating you.

01:53.210 --> 01:55.330
Then maybe we should
call it a draw.

01:55.330 --> 01:56.790
I said almost.

01:56.790 --> 01:59.120
As in, you almost made it
out of the jungle alive.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.460
No back-up, huh?

02:06.460 --> 02:10.040
Well, say hello to
my little friend,

02:10.040 --> 02:11.830
the immobilizing spider.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.380
Yeah, you are lucky...

02:20.380 --> 02:22.290
lucky that that spider
got you,

02:22.290 --> 02:26.540
'cause I was about to put you on
the pain train, freak show.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.080
- Boo.
- ( shrieks )

02:29.420 --> 02:31.380
KC, thank you.

02:31.380 --> 02:33.380
You saved my life.

02:34.830 --> 02:36.880
KC, that is just cold.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.290
Don't be rude.

02:38.290 --> 02:39.620
You may have had
your differences,

02:39.620 --> 02:41.460
but come on,
hug it out.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.920
I would, but I think
that immobilizing spider

02:44.920 --> 02:46.250
may have just
bitten me, too.

02:48.460 --> 02:52.290
Yep, I'm gonna go with
definitely bit me.

02:52.290 --> 02:55.080
As soon as this wears off,
you are so going down.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.080
Why wait, I'm right here.
You better bring it.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.830
- You better bring it.
- You bring it.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.290
- I will bite your...
- I will bite you...

03:02.290 --> 03:05.000
ERNIE: Okay, okay.
Break it up, you two.

03:06.380 --> 03:09.210
- Yeah, you lucky he holding me back.

Honey, your positivity
could use a little...

04:13.710 --> 04:14.790
what's the word
I'm thinking of...

04:14.790 --> 04:16.120
oh, yeah, positivity!

04:18.120 --> 04:20.330
We'll find them,
Agent Kira.

04:20.330 --> 04:23.380
We just have to wait until
vultures start circling,

04:23.380 --> 04:25.500
and then retrieve
their bodies.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.920
Baby, can we take a break
so you can rub my feet?

04:27.920 --> 04:30.500
Craig, I don't like rubbing your
feet when they're squeaky clean.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.620
What makes you think
I wanna rub them nasty things

04:33.620 --> 04:35.710
after you've been draggin' em
through the mud for six hours?

04:35.710 --> 04:37.170
Can I at least
lean on you?

04:37.170 --> 04:39.040
Do I look like
a walking stick to you?

04:39.040 --> 04:42.500
Yes, because you're
tall and lean.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.040
No, no, because you're
a strong, independent woman.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.710
What's the right answer
so you'll rub my feet?

04:49.710 --> 04:52.290
Hey, footprints.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.250
They were definitely here.
We're on the right track.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.920
This one definitely matches
the boots from the safe house.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.830
That's weird.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.620
There are actually
five sets of footprints.

05:01.620 --> 05:03.880
Are you sure, Judy?

05:03.880 --> 05:07.080
I'm a highly intelligent, multi-million
dollar piece of machinery.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.880
I think I can
count to five.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.000
Come on, guys,
we have to pick up the pace

05:19.000 --> 05:21.120
to make it to the
extraction point in time.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.080
But my arms are tired.
She's too heavy.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.830
I'm not too heavy;
you're just too weak.

05:25.830 --> 05:28.540
Everyone who thinks
KC's heavy, raise your hand.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.920
I have an idea. I think I
can concoct an antidote

05:35.920 --> 05:38.500
using plants and herbs
to speed up KC's recovery.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.460
While you're at it, can you
concoct some deodorant,

05:40.460 --> 05:42.460
'cause I just spent the last
two hours in your armpit,

05:42.460 --> 05:43.540
and it was not pretty.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.620
Ernie, help me gather
what we need.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.250
Just to make sure
we don't get separated,

05:50.250 --> 05:52.460
we should hold hands...
the whole time.

05:57.250 --> 06:00.620
( sighs )

06:00.620 --> 06:02.330
What's wrong, Marisa?

06:02.330 --> 06:04.000
Oh, nothing.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.330
( sighs loudly )

06:08.540 --> 06:13.170
Marisa, I know your "something's
bothering you" sigh.

06:13.170 --> 06:16.750
It's a little less wistful than your
"I'm thinking about puppies" sigh,

06:16.750 --> 06:20.290
and a little less throaty than
your "I want some waffles" sigh.

06:20.290 --> 06:21.920
( sighs loudly )

06:21.920 --> 06:24.750
Now you're thinking
about waffles. I know you.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.750
Okay, I know you're battling this
whole temporary paralysis thing

06:27.750 --> 06:30.080
while trying to escape
some crazed assassin

06:30.080 --> 06:33.830
in the middle of the jungle, but
I am dealing with stuff, too.

06:33.830 --> 06:37.330
Senior Picture Day is today, and
I'm upset that I'm missing it.

06:37.330 --> 06:41.460
Wait, this is all about
Senior Picture Day?

06:41.460 --> 06:43.500
Ha! That is the best news
I've heard all day.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.080
I hate picture days.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.120
Just another occasion
people expect you

06:47.120 --> 06:50.080
to take a shower and run
a comb through your hair.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.830
Yeah, FYI,

06:51.830 --> 06:54.250
showering and looking
like a member of society

06:54.250 --> 06:57.710
is not just for
special occasions.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.500
( sighs )

06:59.500 --> 07:01.500
Oh, in case you didn't
recognize that one,

07:01.500 --> 07:03.420
that was my "Marisa's being
really annoying" sigh.

07:03.420 --> 07:05.000
Oh, no, yeah, I'm
very familiar with that one.

07:10.580 --> 07:13.960
Why isn't Sheena answering?

07:13.960 --> 07:17.080
( ringing )

07:27.330 --> 07:29.420
Hi. It's Sheena.

07:29.420 --> 07:31.330
I can't get to the phone.
You know what to do.

07:31.330 --> 07:33.120
If they know what to do,
why do you have to tell them

07:33.120 --> 07:34.750
they know what to do?

07:34.750 --> 07:36.290
Who asked you, Sheena?

07:36.290 --> 07:38.250
Prepare to set
the plane down.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.290
Once again, if you want
something done right,

07:41.290 --> 07:43.670
you have to do it yourself.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.960
Good news. Zoe says
she almost has

07:54.960 --> 07:56.460
all the ingredients
for the antidote.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.460
( sarcastically )
God bless Zoe!

07:58.460 --> 08:00.290
What would the world
do without her?

08:02.500 --> 08:05.250
- What's your problem with her?
- I don't have a problem with her.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.040
- Yes, you do.
- Leave me alone.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.960
- Not until you tell me.
- Stop poking me.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.170
I'll stop poking you when you
tell me what your problem is.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.960
Listen here, brother, okay?

08:18.960 --> 08:21.210
This paralysis
will wear off,

08:21.210 --> 08:23.290
and when it does,
you better stop poking me,

08:23.290 --> 08:26.290
or else you're gonna have one
less finger to worry about.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.580
Fine. I'll stop poking you.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.380
I'll just sit back
and relax.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.380
Time to let
the dogs out.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.120
Don't you dare
put that nasty foot...

08:37.380 --> 08:39.540
Please go back to
poking me, please.

08:46.170 --> 08:49.330
Yes, Agent Johnson,
we've located the children,

08:49.330 --> 08:51.920
and we are en route
to the extraction point.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.290
Ernie, don't touch that.

08:53.290 --> 08:55.080
What is with that boy?

08:56.620 --> 08:59.380
Anyway, everything is fine,
and, uh, what's that?

08:59.380 --> 09:00.670
You wanna talk to KC?

09:02.460 --> 09:04.290
Sure, sure.
Hold on for a second.

09:04.290 --> 09:06.830
Uh, KC,
Agent Johnson's calling.

09:06.830 --> 09:10.830
I said
Agent Johnson's calling!

09:10.830 --> 09:12.830
I'm sorry,
Agent Johnson.

09:12.830 --> 09:15.500
Apparently, nature's calling
at the same time.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.420
She'll get back to you.
Okay, Cooper out.

09:19.750 --> 09:22.000
So you'd rather lie
to Agent Johnson

09:22.000 --> 09:23.580
than let him know
that we're lost.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.750
Why can't you ever
ask for directions?

09:25.750 --> 09:27.290
Because we're not lost.

09:27.290 --> 09:28.670
I just don't know
where we are right now.

09:30.670 --> 09:33.460
Ooh, this is the Beyoncé
concert all over again.

09:33.460 --> 09:35.960
I missed "All the Single
Ladies" 'cause of you.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.710
You mention that show
one more time,

09:37.710 --> 09:39.420
you will be
a single lady.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.170
That a threat
or a promise?

09:42.170 --> 09:44.330
Okay, okay, okay.

09:44.330 --> 09:48.710
You two have been arguing
for the last 300 coconut trees,

09:48.710 --> 09:51.670
and I can't stand hearing you
for one more second.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.580
( both arguing )

09:55.040 --> 09:57.170
( arguing muted )

09:57.170 --> 09:59.170
That's better.
Now let's keep moving.

10:03.290 --> 10:04.750
It is so humid here.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.750
My skin must look flawless.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.500
Too bad I'm missing
Senior Picture Day.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.420
Come on, Marisa,
what is the big deal

10:11.420 --> 10:13.330
about the stupid
senior picture?

10:13.330 --> 10:16.290
KC, years from now,
at our high school reunion,

10:16.290 --> 10:18.420
they will use those pictures
on our nametags,

10:18.420 --> 10:20.330
and how are people
supposed to tell me

10:20.330 --> 10:21.830
I haven't aged a day
if they can't see the day

10:21.830 --> 10:23.540
from which I've never aged?

10:25.620 --> 10:28.290
Oh, well, now that you
put it like that,

10:28.290 --> 10:30.210
I still have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.620
All right,
the antidote is ready.

10:34.620 --> 10:36.500
You should be up
and running in no time.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.120
Uh, that looks like tree snot;
I'm not eating that.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.580
Come on, you'll barely
taste the anaconda saliva

10:42.580 --> 10:44.670
I used as a catalyst.

10:44.670 --> 10:48.500
Snake spit?
That's a double triple pass.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.120
You ate the bugs. Why don't
you just give it a try?

10:51.120 --> 10:52.790
Because I don't
trust Zoe.

10:52.790 --> 10:55.210
I'm already temporarily
paralyzed from the neck down.

10:55.210 --> 10:56.790
I'm in no mood to be
temporarily paralyzed

10:56.790 --> 10:59.290
from the neck up, too.

10:59.290 --> 11:02.000
No. Uh-uh.
I'm not eating.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.540
All right, guys,
time to get tough.

11:03.540 --> 11:04.960
Marisa, grab
her head.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.620
Zoe, plug her nose.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.420
Oh, come on.

11:16.420 --> 11:20.040
That's a good,
good, good, good girl.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.420
Okay, KC,
you should be fine now.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.670
Stand up.

11:24.670 --> 11:27.330
Come on, KC.
Get up.

11:31.330 --> 11:33.830
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.620
All right.
No?

11:41.420 --> 11:45.000
All right,
one, two, three.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.250
All right, guys, I don't think
the antidote is working.

11:53.250 --> 11:56.000
You think?!

11:56.000 --> 11:57.420
I don't understand
why it's having no effect.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.040
I mixed it perfectly.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.290
Look at that,
little Miss Perfect

12:00.290 --> 12:02.330
doesn't know
everything after all.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.290
Should we try another combination
of herbs and plants?

12:06.290 --> 12:09.170
No time. We'll just have to
carry her the rest of the way.

12:09.170 --> 12:10.960
Good call.
Come on, guys.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.420
We gotta get going.
Grab your stuff.

12:12.420 --> 12:13.960
Load her up
and move her out.

12:15.290 --> 12:18.540
You know what?
She's too heavy.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.080
Let's just drag her the rest of the way.
She won't feel it anyway.

12:32.290 --> 12:34.500
Pick up the pace,
Agent Craig.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.330
Put some pep
in your step.

12:36.330 --> 12:39.460
Hold on. We've been
hiking for ten miles.

12:39.460 --> 12:41.500
Not all of us
are machines, you know.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.210
Judy, give him a break. The man
is not exactly in his prime.

12:44.210 --> 12:46.500
Excuse me?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.420
I mean you're not
getting any younger.

12:48.420 --> 12:50.290
What?!

12:50.290 --> 12:51.670
Oh, boy, this isn't
coming out right.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.670
I'm feeling a little
dehydrated.

12:54.670 --> 12:56.120
Are you feeling
a little...

12:56.120 --> 12:57.420
Hey, who's that
over there?

12:59.830 --> 13:02.250
Thank goodness.
The Coopers.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.080
Please help me.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.540
Hey, how do you know
who we are?

13:05.540 --> 13:08.500
Maybe she's the enemy agent
that took the kids.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.500
Judy, check her DNA.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.580
( muffled )
Nice to meet you, too.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.080
I'm Zoe.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.380
I was sent by the Organization
to help you guys.

13:19.380 --> 13:22.460
I was tracking KC and Ernie
with some enemy agent.

13:22.460 --> 13:23.670
I don't know, I think
her name is Sheena,

13:23.670 --> 13:25.330
or something like that.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.620
She temporarily immobilized me
with a poisonous spider.

13:27.620 --> 13:31.380
Right. Why would we believe
anything you have to say?

13:31.380 --> 13:33.380
Because the DNA
doesn't match.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.080
She's not the one
we've been tracking.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.670
Oh, my bad.
Nice to meet you.

13:37.670 --> 13:40.710
They couldn't have gotten far.
We can still catch up to them,

13:40.710 --> 13:43.170
but as I may have
mentioned before, I can't move.

13:43.170 --> 13:46.380
You've been bitten by
the Brazilian jumping spider.

13:46.380 --> 13:48.380
I think I can
make you an antidote.

13:48.380 --> 13:52.420
Fine. As long as you don't put
your fingers back in my mouth.

13:52.420 --> 13:55.040
Come on, guys. Help me
gather what we need.

14:00.670 --> 14:02.500
Your plan is working.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.500
You're a genius, Sheena.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.330
It takes one
to know one, Sheena.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.290
Okay?

14:17.420 --> 14:18.960
I'm tired.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.880
Let's take a break.

14:24.380 --> 14:25.330
KC: Ow...

14:25.330 --> 14:28.080
is what I would say

14:28.080 --> 14:29.920
if I could feel
something right now,

14:29.920 --> 14:31.290
which I can't,

14:31.290 --> 14:34.080
because the paralysis
hasn't worn off yet.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.500
I don't understand why.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
I know I mixed the antidote
perfectly.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.540
Well, looks like
your miracle cure

14:39.540 --> 14:42.120
is missing two things:
a miracle and a cure!

14:44.290 --> 14:47.210
Come on, Zoe, let's go
find something to snack on.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.460
( sighs loudly )

14:55.460 --> 14:58.500
Yes, Marisa, I recognize
your "I need attention" sigh.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.290
What is it?

15:00.290 --> 15:02.330
Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything,

15:02.330 --> 15:03.750
but since you asked...

15:03.750 --> 15:05.290
Senior Picture Day
is over by now,

15:05.290 --> 15:07.500
and I totally missed it.

15:07.500 --> 15:08.960
Marisa, seriously,

15:08.960 --> 15:10.460
will you give this
senior picture thing a rest?

15:10.460 --> 15:13.380
I am so sorry you don't
like me talking about this.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.170
Feel free to get up and leave at any time.
Oh, that's right, you can't,

15:16.170 --> 15:18.210
just like I can't be
in the yearbook now.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.670
- Why is it so important to you?
- Because!

15:23.580 --> 15:27.330
I guess I just never thought
I'd actually get to be a senior.

15:27.330 --> 15:29.330
What are you talking about?

15:29.330 --> 15:32.040
Look...
( chuckles )

15:32.040 --> 15:35.670
KC, I'm not
a brainiac like you.

15:35.670 --> 15:38.290
I'm not motivated
like you.

15:38.290 --> 15:41.120
It doesn't come easy for me
like it does for you,

15:41.120 --> 15:44.250
so I don't know,

15:44.250 --> 15:45.670
I guess in the back
of my mind,

15:45.670 --> 15:48.120
I always just wondered
if I was...

15:48.120 --> 15:51.080
ever gonna actually
get to be a senior,

15:51.080 --> 15:54.460
and now that I am,
I don't even have

15:54.460 --> 15:56.620
a senior picture
to show for it.

15:58.920 --> 15:59.960
Oh.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.290
Marisa, I'm...

16:02.290 --> 16:04.500
I'm really sorry.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.790
Your hug is
actually making me--

16:06.790 --> 16:08.500
Wait a minute!

16:11.290 --> 16:14.120
Uh, for someone who's
in the throes of paralysis,

16:14.120 --> 16:17.380
you seem to be
moving pretty good now.

16:17.380 --> 16:19.330
It's a miracle.

16:28.290 --> 16:30.380
Wow.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.210
Wow, you know what, guys?

16:32.210 --> 16:33.540
I've gotta tell you,

16:33.540 --> 16:35.920
it feels good to be able
to move again.

16:35.920 --> 16:40.460
Let this be a lesson
for all of us.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.920
Appreciate what you got
while you still got it.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.670
Like silence.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.960
Why don't we all
appreciate silence

16:47.960 --> 16:49.460
by not talking about
what just happened

16:49.460 --> 16:51.830
all the way
to the extraction point?

16:51.830 --> 16:54.460
Yeah, but before
we do that,

16:54.460 --> 16:56.290
can I just
point out something?

16:56.290 --> 16:58.670
You're a liar.
A liar!

16:58.670 --> 17:00.460
We just carried you two
miles through the jungle,

17:00.460 --> 17:02.380
and you've been
faking it?

17:02.380 --> 17:03.750
Why would you
do that?

17:03.750 --> 17:06.790
I thought it would be
a pleasant distraction.

17:06.790 --> 17:08.920
It was either that
or I Spy,

17:08.920 --> 17:11.080
and I don't know
about you guys,

17:11.080 --> 17:14.000
but the only thing I spy out
here is our strong bond

17:14.000 --> 17:16.790
and willingness to
immediately forgive each other.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.500
Am I right or not?

17:18.500 --> 17:21.420
I'll tell you
what I spy.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.380
A liar.

17:23.380 --> 17:25.290
KC didn't want Zoe's
antidote to work,

17:25.290 --> 17:27.080
because she's
jealous of her.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.790
- Jealous.
- That's not true.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.960
Oh, isn't it, liar?
Isn't it?

17:30.960 --> 17:32.330
The only thing
she's tried to do

17:32.330 --> 17:34.170
since we met her
is help us.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.420
- but you can't accept help.
- That's not it at all.

17:36.420 --> 17:38.330
Oh, you have to do
everything by yourself.

17:38.330 --> 17:40.500
You can't let anyone
else have the spotlight.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.330
You always
have to be the hero.

17:42.330 --> 17:43.750
No, I don't.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.120
Then why do you dislike
Zoe so much?

17:45.120 --> 17:46.500
Because I don't
want her to save us.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.920
- Why not?
- Because I have to save us.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.620
- Why?
- Because it's all my fault.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.830
What does that
even mean?

17:53.830 --> 17:56.460
The reason we're in
this stupid jungle.

17:56.460 --> 17:57.750
The reason we're on the run,

17:57.750 --> 17:59.500
the reason why Zane
is even free,

17:59.500 --> 18:02.250
and knows where we are
is because of me, okay?

18:02.250 --> 18:03.710
I'm the one
who did all this,

18:03.710 --> 18:05.210
so I have to fix it.

18:06.790 --> 18:10.380
Wow. This is making
my whole Picture Day thing

18:10.380 --> 18:14.460
really petty in comparison.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.380
It may be your fault,
but that doesn't mean

18:17.380 --> 18:20.290
that you have to fix
everything by yourself.

18:20.290 --> 18:21.790
I'm here for you.

18:21.790 --> 18:24.210
We all are.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Thanks, guys.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.920
You know what, Zoe?

18:29.920 --> 18:32.330
I, um, I owe you
an apology.

18:32.330 --> 18:34.170
You were just trying
to do your job,

18:34.170 --> 18:35.710
and you know what, you are
really, really good at it.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.880
I was just taking
everything I had,

18:37.880 --> 18:40.380
and bottling it up
and taking it out on you.

18:40.380 --> 18:44.380
I just hope you forgive me.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.080
Get your hands
off my baby.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.920
That's right.
KC, we came to save you,

18:52.920 --> 18:54.880
- and we brought back-up.
- That's right.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.330
I'm the back-up.
Now back up.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.710
Good one, Sheena.
Thank you, Sheena.

19:00.710 --> 19:03.290
Oh, great,
not these two again.

19:05.290 --> 19:09.380
Zoe, this is the rescue
portion of the rescue mission.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.620
Dad, that's not Zoe.
This is Zoe.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.330
Okay, then
who is that?

19:13.330 --> 19:15.460
I guess that
makes me Sheena.

19:15.460 --> 19:18.170
Zane sent me, and I'm here
to eliminate you all.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.420
Now who wants
to go first?

19:19.420 --> 19:23.000
Is no one an option?

19:23.000 --> 19:24.540
Um, let me think about that.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.790
No.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.380
You know what, guys,
I'll go first.

19:28.380 --> 19:31.000
It was my fault.
I'm sorry.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
As for you, Sheena...

20:04.460 --> 20:06.830
KC, I'm
so proud of you!

20:06.830 --> 20:09.460
I'm so happy to see
my babies again.

20:09.460 --> 20:11.880
- You all right, son?
- I'm okay, Dad.

20:11.880 --> 20:14.290
Now we know Zoe wasn't
trying to take you out,

20:14.290 --> 20:16.040
maybe you can
take her out.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.540
- Dad!
- Come on.

20:23.330 --> 20:24.920
Honey, I just wanna say,

20:24.920 --> 20:27.170
we were under
a lot of pressure.

20:27.170 --> 20:30.250
Things got crazy out there
in the jungle,

20:30.250 --> 20:32.620
and some things were said
that shouldn't have been said.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.670
Oh, honey, I understand.

20:34.670 --> 20:36.460
You don't have to apologize.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.330
Oh, I wasn't.

20:38.330 --> 20:42.250
I was reminding you that
you owe me an apology.

20:42.250 --> 20:44.670
If I were you,
I'd get my butt

20:44.670 --> 20:47.290
in that chopper,
Craig Cooper. Now!

20:47.290 --> 20:49.460
Apology accepted.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.120
Marisa, wait.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.330
What? Do I have one of
those paralyzing spiders on me?

20:57.330 --> 20:59.040
No. Just
the perfect light.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.620
One, two, three.

21:03.540 --> 21:06.330
- I mean, it's not a senior picture...
- Aww!

21:06.330 --> 21:10.040
but I guarantee it's a moment
you're never gonna wanna forget.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.710
Aww, KC.

21:11.710 --> 21:13.540
You know, unless
Ryan Gosling

21:13.540 --> 21:15.380
finally responds to
my online petition,

21:15.380 --> 21:17.460
I think I want you
to be my prom date.

21:17.460 --> 21:21.250
Aw, well, if Drake asks me,
then you're out of luck.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.420
Well, thanks for
all your help.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.080
It was great meeting you.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.830
Hey, you never know.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.330
Maybe we'll work on another
mission together someday.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.920
I'd like that.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.540
I'd like that, too.

21:33.540 --> 21:36.080
Anyway, uh,
I should get going.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.580
I should be
going, too.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.460
Well, see ya around.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.500
Not if I see you first.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.790
Not if I see you first.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.290
Not if I see you...

21:44.290 --> 21:46.620
Ugh! I haven't even
been to prison yet,

21:46.620 --> 21:50.080
and I already feel
like I'm being punished.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.210
Sheena, you're just mad 'cause
nobody's interested in you.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.750
Excuse me? I don't need a
man to complete me, Sheena.

21:55.750 --> 21:58.040
Way to ruin
the moment, Sheena.

22:02.330 --> 22:06.420
Well, the good news is,
we're all together again.

22:06.420 --> 22:10.620
And recent intel shows that
Zane has no idea where we are.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.250
That's a reason
to celebrate.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.500
( all cheering )

22:14.500 --> 22:15.620
Hey, Judy,
hit the music.

22:15.620 --> 22:18.710
( Brazilian music plays )

22:24.540 --> 22:27.250
Hey, excuse me, pilot.
Where are we going to next?

22:27.250 --> 22:29.500
Is there a new safe house?

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
Oh, there's
a misunderstanding.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.120
You're not going
to a safe house.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.580

22:46.710 --> 22:49.420

You're gonna need it.

23:00.290 --> 23:01.620
